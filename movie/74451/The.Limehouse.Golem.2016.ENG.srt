1
00:01:02,925 --> 00:01:04,636
Let us begin...

2
00:01:04,717 --> 00:01:06,554
...my friends...

3
00:01:07,167 --> 00:01:09,037
...at the end.

4
00:01:29,072 --> 00:01:30,610
John?

5
00:01:31,541 --> 00:01:33,088
John!

6
00:02:05,105 --> 00:02:06,929
He left nothing?

7
00:02:07,709 --> 00:02:12,400
No note? If he meant to poison himself,
why would he not at least leave a note?

8
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:16,826
I fear that the act of burning his papers
bears testament enough to his state of mind.

9
00:02:18,551 --> 00:02:20,876
Mrs. Cree, forgive me...

10
00:02:20,956 --> 00:02:23,852
...I know this is neither
the time nor the place but...

11
00:02:24,332 --> 00:02:27,230
...may I say what an ardent
admirer I am of your work?

12
00:02:27,829 --> 00:02:29,719
I looked in the kitchen, sir.

13
00:02:30,498 --> 00:02:32,321
This was all I could find.

14
00:02:34,169 --> 00:02:38,326
I'm afraid this'll be it. There was
residue in a glass on the nightstand.

15
00:02:38,406 --> 00:02:40,294
It can't have been in there, sir.

16
00:02:40,374 --> 00:02:43,064
His nightly cordial was always
prepared by Mrs. Cree.

17
00:02:43,144 --> 00:02:44,666
Aveline.

18
00:02:45,845 --> 00:02:49,469
You... did not make the drink?

19
00:02:50,152 --> 00:02:54,276
Surely you're not asking me in earnest
if I poisoned my husband?

20
00:02:54,356 --> 00:02:57,279
Sir, believe me,
she cannot have done this!

21
00:02:57,359 --> 00:02:59,767
The two of them were in a most
violent dispute yesterday!

22
00:02:59,868 --> 00:03:02,817
Why would she prepare Mr. Cree a nightcap
when they were not on speaking terms?

23
00:03:02,897 --> 00:03:05,560
Aveline, what has possessed you?

24
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:09,085
Sir, please, allow me to explain.

25
00:03:09,165 --> 00:03:11,190
I'm sorry, Mrs. Cree.

26
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:13,392
You'll need to do that
down at Scotland Yard.

27
00:03:19,977 --> 00:03:24,640
A woman accused
of poisoning her husband.

28
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:28,118
But not just any woman...

29
00:03:30,055 --> 00:03:32,111
...little Lizzie...

30
00:03:32,191 --> 00:03:35,882
...darling of the music halls.

31
00:03:37,464 --> 00:03:39,786
But the city was in thrall...

32
00:03:39,866 --> 00:03:44,692
...with the fearsome Limehouse Golem.

33
00:03:45,821 --> 00:03:47,526
Who was he?

34
00:03:47,606 --> 00:03:50,428
Who would be his next victim?

35
00:03:51,611 --> 00:03:54,200
The Golem had last struck...

36
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:57,372
...the day before her arrest.

37
00:03:58,352 --> 00:04:00,940
And his was the name...

38
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:04,061
...on every Londoner's lips.

39
00:04:23,076 --> 00:04:24,965
How many are dead?

40
00:04:26,045 --> 00:04:27,621
Five.

41
00:04:27,701 --> 00:04:32,561
Shopkeeper Mr. Gerrard,
his wife Mary, their maid...

42
00:04:33,051 --> 00:04:35,506
...and the two Gerrard children.

43
00:04:37,689 --> 00:04:41,315
It's not number 29.
29 Ratcliffe Highway?

44
00:04:41,395 --> 00:04:43,884
- What of it?
- The Ratcliffe highway murders?

45
00:04:43,965 --> 00:04:47,474
- John Williams?
- It's a bit before my time.

46
00:04:47,554 --> 00:04:50,632
And mine. It was 70 years ago.

47
00:04:52,774 --> 00:04:55,564
Inspector Roberts! Can you confirm
that this is the work of the Golem?

48
00:04:55,644 --> 00:04:58,535
- What is it about this house?
- Do you think it could be cursed, sir?

49
00:04:58,615 --> 00:05:01,370
Gentlemen, gentlemen, please!

50
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:06,073
I'd ask you to direct
your requests to my colleague...

51
00:05:06,153 --> 00:05:10,110
...Detective Inspector Kildare.
He's taking over the case.

52
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:12,045
Kildare? How are you spelling that?

53
00:05:12,125 --> 00:05:13,446
Taking over?

54
00:05:13,526 --> 00:05:17,172
I'm just stepping aside,
not stepping down.

55
00:05:19,699 --> 00:05:22,555
The public seeks reassurance, Kildare.

56
00:05:22,635 --> 00:05:25,336
What better way than
to give them new blood?

57
00:05:27,373 --> 00:05:30,363
Are you fearful of stepping into
the shoes of the great Mr. Roberts?

58
00:05:30,445 --> 00:05:33,866
How many more people have to die
before the Golem is caught?

59
00:05:33,946 --> 00:05:35,530
Driver!

60
00:05:36,316 --> 00:05:38,153
Detective Roberts!

61
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:43,343
Inspector Kildare, is it true
that this is your first murder case?

62
00:05:43,423 --> 00:05:45,277
Inspector Kildare!

63
00:05:46,225 --> 00:05:47,979
Move. Move back.

64
00:05:48,059 --> 00:05:49,961
Do you know if they'll be displaying
the bodies today?

65
00:05:50,041 --> 00:05:53,551
Step aside, sir.
The maid was found over there.

66
00:05:53,631 --> 00:05:55,762
Were there footprints when you arrived?
The Golem's prints?

67
00:05:55,842 --> 00:05:58,625
- Half of Limehouse was already here.
- Which of the victims was found there?

68
00:05:58,705 --> 00:06:02,113
None. The Golem moved that one himself.
Either Mr. or Mrs. Gerrard.

69
00:06:02,193 --> 00:06:05,165
More likely him. If the maid was killed
first, he'd investigate the disturbance.

70
00:06:05,245 --> 00:06:07,433
- Where is her body now?
- We took her upstairs, sir.

71
00:06:07,514 --> 00:06:09,608
At least up there we can
keep the hoi poloi out.

72
00:06:09,688 --> 00:06:12,100
- Down here is a lost cause.
- They can't all be reporters.

73
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:16,773
No. Locals looking for entertainment.
Cheaper than a ticket to a shocker.

74
00:06:16,853 --> 00:06:20,381
Sometimes I suspect if I was dispatched
to hell, I'd barely notice the change...

75
00:06:20,461 --> 00:06:23,126
...bar the weather.
This is Inspector Kildare.

76
00:06:23,206 --> 00:06:25,532
- Taking over from Roberts.
- Sir.

77
00:06:26,732 --> 00:06:30,799
Can you tell this idiot to let me up?
I'm with the <i>Evening Post!</i>

78
00:06:40,745 --> 00:06:42,776
This is the maid?

79
00:06:51,487 --> 00:06:53,309
I'm sorry.

80
00:06:53,690 --> 00:06:55,990
I've never seen anything of this kind.

81
00:06:57,728 --> 00:06:59,759
Neither have I.

82
00:07:41,937 --> 00:07:44,165
"He who observes...

83
00:07:44,245 --> 00:07:48,397
...spills no less blood
than he who inflicts the blow."

84
00:07:48,477 --> 00:07:50,365
Lactantius.

85
00:07:50,446 --> 00:07:52,268
Impressive, sir.

86
00:07:53,548 --> 00:07:56,137
The truth has a habit
of sticking in the mind.

87
00:07:56,370 --> 00:07:57,894
Truth?

88
00:08:00,274 --> 00:08:04,740
Those who fail to prevent injustice
are as guilty as the perpetrator.

89
00:08:05,962 --> 00:08:07,512
It's a message...

90
00:08:08,564 --> 00:08:10,528
...to us.

91
00:08:16,667 --> 00:08:19,927
Evidence... John Cree case.

92
00:08:20,207 --> 00:08:23,165
- The poisoning.
- You've had quite a week.

93
00:08:23,245 --> 00:08:25,709
First the Limehouse Golem, now this.

94
00:08:29,818 --> 00:08:32,575
I heard Inspector Kildare
was asking after you.

95
00:08:32,655 --> 00:08:36,512
Yes. I don't know what he wanted.
I keep missing him.

96
00:08:36,592 --> 00:08:40,014
Well, they did right giving him
the Golem case, I reckon.

97
00:08:40,094 --> 00:08:45,287
He'd have risen well above Roberts by now
if those rumors hadn't done for him.

98
00:08:45,367 --> 00:08:48,722
You know. That he wasn't
the marrying kind...

99
00:08:51,671 --> 00:08:52,975
...men.

100
00:08:54,472 --> 00:08:57,915
It's before your time, I suppose.

101
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:07,661
Come in.

102
00:09:09,591 --> 00:09:13,648
- I got your message, sir.
- I'm being assigned a constable.

103
00:09:13,728 --> 00:09:16,950
I thought someone of your knowledge
of Limehouse might be an asset.

104
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:19,552
When I heard nothing back, I thought
perhaps the offer didn't appeal.

105
00:09:19,632 --> 00:09:22,354
I came by twice, sir. You were out.

106
00:09:22,434 --> 00:09:25,475
I was at Limehouse.
Appealing for witnesses.

107
00:09:25,555 --> 00:09:27,436
To no avail.

108
00:09:33,029 --> 00:09:36,387
- What are you looking for?
- I'm just looking. Trying to understand.

109
00:09:36,467 --> 00:09:39,322
The Golem's a madman.
What else is there to be understood?

110
00:09:39,402 --> 00:09:42,958
Even madness has its own logic.
Here there's none.

111
00:09:43,038 --> 00:09:45,529
At Ratcliffe Highway,
he slaughtered a household.

112
00:09:45,609 --> 00:09:49,665
The previous week, a prostitute.
Alice Stanton. Before that, Solomon Weil.

113
00:09:49,745 --> 00:09:52,610
He was an old man, a scholar.

114
00:09:55,048 --> 00:09:56,904
Oh, my God.

115
00:09:56,984 --> 00:09:59,677
- Is that his...
- Yes.

116
00:09:59,756 --> 00:10:03,049
Laid upon the open pages
of a book on Jewish folklore...

117
00:10:03,129 --> 00:10:05,133
...like a bookmark.

118
00:10:06,363 --> 00:10:10,153
"The Legend of the Golem."
Is that how the press got the name?

119
00:10:10,233 --> 00:10:13,359
- Our murderer obviously approved.
- And who were the first two?

120
00:10:13,439 --> 00:10:16,791
Both women of the streets.
I do remember reading of that one.

121
00:10:16,871 --> 00:10:20,730
- "Old Salty."
- Her name was Jane Quig.

122
00:10:21,609 --> 00:10:24,299
The point is there's no story
to any of them.

123
00:10:24,379 --> 00:10:27,735
Men, women, young, old.
Jew and Christian. Rich and poor.

124
00:10:27,814 --> 00:10:30,675
- Perhaps he just likes to kill.
- No.

125
00:10:31,154 --> 00:10:33,943
I'll wager there's a tale being told.

126
00:10:34,023 --> 00:10:38,037
If we can sink to his circle
of damnation to comprehend it.

127
00:10:39,494 --> 00:10:43,077
If I may say, sir, seems you've been
wasted down in theft-and-fraud.

128
00:10:43,177 --> 00:10:47,176
I'll be back there soon enough, if the Golem
strikes again. That seems to be the plan.

129
00:10:47,256 --> 00:10:50,591
- What do you mean?
- The yard is setting me up as a scapegoat.

130
00:10:50,671 --> 00:10:54,094
They'll not risk Roberts,
will they? I'm expendable.

131
00:10:54,174 --> 00:10:58,221
They get to preserve the reputation
of their golden boy and the public...

132
00:11:00,415 --> 00:11:03,305
- ...get blood.
- Well, as I said back in Limehouse...

133
00:11:03,385 --> 00:11:05,941
seems they never have
their fill of that.

134
00:11:06,021 --> 00:11:08,610
"He who spectates." He doesn't mean us.

135
00:11:08,690 --> 00:11:13,948
He means the public. The public
want blood. The Golem provides it.

136
00:11:14,028 --> 00:11:17,083
Yes! I'm sure that must be it, sir.

137
00:11:17,163 --> 00:11:19,637
Are you? I'm not.

138
00:11:20,866 --> 00:11:24,128
Do you feel like a walk...
to the library?

139
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:37,907
That quotation.
About the gladiatorial ring?

140
00:11:37,987 --> 00:11:41,842
The guilt of the audience who seek bloodshed?
Well, perhaps you read it elsewhere.

141
00:11:41,922 --> 00:11:45,144
It's quoted in an old piece
by the essayist Thomas de Quincey.

142
00:11:45,224 --> 00:11:47,676
One I imagine might be of interest
to a man in your line of work.

143
00:11:47,755 --> 00:11:49,724
- What's the piece?
- "On murder considered...

144
00:11:49,803 --> 00:11:54,663
...as one of the fine arts." A satire about
the Ratcliffe Highway killings of 1811.

145
00:11:57,167 --> 00:11:59,724
Should we talk with this de Quincey?

146
00:11:59,803 --> 00:12:03,640
He has been dead for 20 years,
Flood, so it might be a bit...

147
00:12:13,318 --> 00:12:15,334
What is it?

148
00:12:19,625 --> 00:12:22,871
<i>Left to rot. To kill a whore.</i>

149
00:12:47,851 --> 00:12:49,575
Who last borrowed this book?

150
00:12:49,655 --> 00:12:52,243
This is a reading room, Inspector,
not a local library.

151
00:12:52,323 --> 00:12:55,512
So nothing leaves the premises?
Do you keep an attendance record?

152
00:12:55,592 --> 00:12:59,283
Of course, but there's no way of knowing
what anyone read or when they read it.

153
00:12:59,363 --> 00:13:02,193
Who was here on September the 24th?

154
00:13:05,403 --> 00:13:07,693
There were four men
in the reading room that day. Why?

155
00:13:07,773 --> 00:13:10,929
It's the final entry in a diary someone
has kept in the pages of this book.

156
00:13:11,009 --> 00:13:13,057
- Were you here yourself?
- I'm here every day.

157
00:13:13,137 --> 00:13:15,116
Then I must ask you for
a sample of your handwriting.

158
00:13:15,216 --> 00:13:18,662
I'll need the same from all the staff.
And those four names, please?

159
00:13:19,581 --> 00:13:20,903
<i>The</i> Dan Leno?

160
00:13:20,983 --> 00:13:24,006
And <i>the</i> Karl Marx and George Gissing.

161
00:13:24,086 --> 00:13:26,472
If you're a follower
of philosophy and literature.

162
00:13:26,552 --> 00:13:28,778
What do you know of John Cree?

163
00:13:29,659 --> 00:13:31,214
Sir?

164
00:13:31,594 --> 00:13:34,407
If he's the same John Cree
I'm thinking of...

165
00:13:35,433 --> 00:13:37,030
...I believe he's dead.

166
00:13:42,304 --> 00:13:44,893
Place the diary in my files.
Keep it safe.

167
00:13:44,973 --> 00:13:48,965
Find out all you can about George Gissing,
Karl Marx, and Dan Leno.

168
00:13:49,045 --> 00:13:51,800
- Where are you going?
- To investigate the dead man.

169
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:55,179
If he was the Golem,
London's troubles are over.

170
00:14:00,587 --> 00:14:05,715
And you describe your husband
as being in a state of despair...

171
00:14:05,794 --> 00:14:09,119
in the weeks leading
to his death, yes?

172
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:11,971
My husband had spent several years
writing a play, Your Honor.

173
00:14:12,051 --> 00:14:14,306
Entitled "Misery Junction."

174
00:14:14,387 --> 00:14:16,592
It was not a success.

175
00:14:16,972 --> 00:14:18,760
I believe he never recovered from that.

176
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:23,331
And yet he continued to pass
each day in the reading room...

177
00:14:23,411 --> 00:14:26,767
...at the British museum,
reading and writing.

178
00:14:26,847 --> 00:14:29,170
A change in mood and a change
in habit are two different things.

179
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:33,749
On the day of his death,
the librarian described your husband...

180
00:14:33,829 --> 00:14:36,996
...as being in good spirits.

181
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:39,982
My husband was adept at presenting
a false face to the world, sir.

182
00:14:40,062 --> 00:14:44,252
And that is something
you would understand...

183
00:14:44,332 --> 00:14:47,588
...is it not, Mrs. Cree?

184
00:14:47,668 --> 00:14:49,491
Playing...

185
00:14:50,171 --> 00:14:51,935
...a role?

186
00:14:53,674 --> 00:14:56,063
I used to be a music hall performer,
if that's what you mean.

187
00:14:56,143 --> 00:14:58,632
And what of the role you play
today before this court?

188
00:14:58,712 --> 00:15:03,169
That of a respectable, educated lady.

189
00:15:03,748 --> 00:15:07,042
You were born out of wedlock,
were you not?

190
00:15:07,723 --> 00:15:09,577
Yes, sir.

191
00:15:09,856 --> 00:15:14,082
As a child, you stitched sailcloth...

192
00:15:14,761 --> 00:15:19,203
...and passed much time with men.

193
00:15:21,635 --> 00:15:25,808
I can assure you I was
a God-fearing child. An innocent.

194
00:15:25,888 --> 00:15:29,495
<i>I was tasked by my mother
to deliver our sails to the docks.</i>

195
00:15:29,575 --> 00:15:32,131
<i>Encountering men was not something
I could hope to avoid.</i>

196
00:15:32,211 --> 00:15:34,833
- Here you go, good as new.
- Carry that all the way?

197
00:15:34,913 --> 00:15:36,538
Look at your poor hands, Lizzie.

198
00:15:36,618 --> 00:15:38,739
Me ma says I'm made
for the bloodtubs with these hands.

199
00:15:38,818 --> 00:15:42,873
Don't you dare run off and join the theater.
These sails ain't gonna mend themselves.

200
00:15:42,953 --> 00:15:46,640
I like the comics. Charlie's gonna
take me to see Dan Leno one day.

201
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:49,123
Aren't you, Charlie, when I'm older?

202
00:16:01,713 --> 00:16:04,912
Dan Leno was never that blue.
Did Charlie teach you that?

203
00:16:04,992 --> 00:16:07,467
Just don't let your ma hear it.
She'll kill ya.

204
00:16:07,547 --> 00:16:09,590
What's it mean?

205
00:16:10,449 --> 00:16:12,506
If you want, I'll show you.

206
00:16:12,586 --> 00:16:16,087
Me mum will be wanting me home,
if you'll give me our pay.

207
00:16:16,989 --> 00:16:19,020
Money's in my hut.

208
00:16:32,135 --> 00:16:34,167
What took you so long?

209
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:44,581
Has a man laid hands on you?

210
00:16:45,647 --> 00:16:47,272
You liar.

211
00:16:47,352 --> 00:16:49,026
I fell.

212
00:16:49,106 --> 00:16:51,010
Come here.

213
00:16:53,291 --> 00:16:56,547
- What did I do wrong?
- Mother, no, please.

214
00:16:56,627 --> 00:17:00,519
- Did I not teach you well enough?
- No, I beg you!

215
00:17:01,898 --> 00:17:03,355
Come here.

216
00:17:08,839 --> 00:17:10,828
You want me to go to heaven, don't you?

217
00:17:10,908 --> 00:17:13,210
That place will keep you
from heaven, Lizzie.

218
00:17:20,734 --> 00:17:23,197
That is enough, Mrs. Cree!

219
00:17:27,373 --> 00:17:29,887
Court is adjourned for lunch!

220
00:17:37,797 --> 00:17:41,115
Anyone come by from <i>The Era</i> newspaper?
I'm expecting a package.

221
00:17:41,195 --> 00:17:43,011
No package.

222
00:17:43,941 --> 00:17:45,804
Just this.

223
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:53,650
John Cree.

224
00:17:57,084 --> 00:18:01,522
No luck getting a sample of Cree's handwriting
from his old employers, I'm afraid, sir.

225
00:18:01,889 --> 00:18:04,312
They don't keep reporters' submissions.

226
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:06,514
Had a more recent portrait, though.

227
00:18:06,594 --> 00:18:09,218
And I've asked archives for all
the files on Gissing and Marx.

228
00:18:09,299 --> 00:18:12,164
Very good. See if they have
anything on Leno.

229
00:18:28,548 --> 00:18:31,606
<i>September the 5th, 1880.</i>

230
00:18:31,885 --> 00:18:34,074
<i>It was a fine bright evening...</i>

231
00:18:34,154 --> 00:18:36,956
<i>...and I could feel a murder coming on.</i>

232
00:18:37,457 --> 00:18:39,816
Since it was to be my first show...

233
00:18:39,896 --> 00:18:43,553
...I decided by way of inspiration
to pay a visit to the site...

234
00:18:43,633 --> 00:18:46,488
of the immortal
Ratcliffe Highway murders.

235
00:18:46,767 --> 00:18:49,357
<i>More than half a century ago
on this sacred spot...</i>

236
00:18:49,437 --> 00:18:52,426
<i>...an entire family
was dispatched into eternity...</i>

237
00:18:52,506 --> 00:18:54,629
<i>...by a man named John Williams...</i>

238
00:18:54,908 --> 00:18:59,383
<i>...a man Thomas de Quincey described
as an artist of exquisite skill.</i>

239
00:18:59,463 --> 00:19:02,502
<i>And yet now the site
of his greatest work was defiled...</i>

240
00:19:02,583 --> 00:19:05,104
<i>...by a seller of secondhand clothes.</i>

241
00:19:05,184 --> 00:19:08,004
We're closed, I'm afraid, sir.

242
00:19:08,721 --> 00:19:12,280
Oh, sorry. The door was open.

243
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:15,452
No matter. I'll be sure to return.

244
00:19:17,132 --> 00:19:20,292
<i>But I was a beginner, an understudy.</i>

245
00:19:20,372 --> 00:19:23,399
<i>Not yet ready for the great stage.</i>

246
00:19:35,913 --> 00:19:38,870
<i>An artist must perfect his craft...</i>

247
00:19:38,951 --> 00:19:43,210
<i>...and tonight I would start
with a small, private rehearsal.</i>

248
00:19:43,290 --> 00:19:45,995
- Gin?
- Don't you think you've had enough?

249
00:19:46,075 --> 00:19:48,047
I want you awake.

250
00:19:48,127 --> 00:19:50,359
Or else you'll miss all the fun.

251
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:16,796
<i>I felt that she suspected my game from
the start and offered herself willingly...</i>

252
00:20:16,876 --> 00:20:19,422
<i>...warm in the knowledge that
the world would soon be forced...</i>

253
00:20:19,502 --> 00:20:21,657
<i>...to confront the plight of her kind.</i>

254
00:20:29,834 --> 00:20:33,323
<i>I took out her eyes in case my image
had been imprinted upon them...</i>

255
00:20:33,403 --> 00:20:37,294
<i>...and washed the blood from my hands
with the gin in her chamber pot.</i>

256
00:20:37,374 --> 00:20:39,667
<i>My first performance...</i>

257
00:20:40,111 --> 00:20:41,852
<i>...was complete.</i>

258
00:21:02,431 --> 00:21:06,432
Mrs. Cree? I'm Inspector Kildare
of Scotland Yard.

259
00:21:07,470 --> 00:21:10,084
I suppose you're here to chastise me
for my candor in court.

260
00:21:10,164 --> 00:21:12,468
On the contrary, I applaud you for it.

261
00:21:12,548 --> 00:21:15,666
It's all too easy to imagine that those
who have enjoyed success...

262
00:21:15,745 --> 00:21:18,036
...have never known suffering.

263
00:21:18,417 --> 00:21:21,539
Well, to quote the great
Dan Leno, "Here we are again."

264
00:21:21,619 --> 00:21:25,510
I'm afraid I'm not a frequenter
of the music halls.

265
00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:29,659
He portrays the suffering of women.
My gender becomes inured to injustice.

266
00:21:29,738 --> 00:21:33,835
We expect it. Until we can
greet it merely with a shrug.

267
00:21:34,895 --> 00:21:36,818
I understood he was a comic.

268
00:21:36,898 --> 00:21:39,577
The line between comedy
and tragedy is a fine one.

269
00:21:41,437 --> 00:21:43,620
You haven't told me why you're here.

270
00:21:47,443 --> 00:21:51,187
I wish to put it to you that I know
why you might have had good reason...

271
00:21:51,267 --> 00:21:54,470
- ...to poison your husband.
- Please, sir, I'm hoarse from repetition.

272
00:21:54,551 --> 00:21:56,705
There will be no confession.
My plea has been made.

273
00:21:56,784 --> 00:21:59,909
Mrs. Cree, I'm not
assigned to your case.

274
00:21:59,989 --> 00:22:04,580
I'm here because your husband
is a suspect in another matter.

275
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:06,519
What matter?

276
00:22:08,912 --> 00:22:11,351
A journal has been found.

277
00:22:11,431 --> 00:22:15,659
I'd like to compare the handwriting with his.
Might you have anything that he wrote?

278
00:22:15,738 --> 00:22:17,631
- His papers...
- He burned them, yes.

279
00:22:17,711 --> 00:22:22,331
Mrs. Cree, if your husband were
found to have committed murder...

280
00:22:22,811 --> 00:22:25,354
...your claims of suicide gain weight.

281
00:22:25,434 --> 00:22:28,169
- Do you understand? You could go free.
- Murder?

282
00:22:28,249 --> 00:22:32,340
I'm investigating a series of deaths.
They're calling them the "Limehouse Golem...

283
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:34,941
You can't honestly think my husband
capable of such things?

284
00:22:35,021 --> 00:22:37,743
It's not my place to have an opinion.

285
00:22:37,823 --> 00:22:39,880
I just follow the threads.

286
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:42,482
The newspaper said
it was your first murder case.

287
00:22:42,562 --> 00:22:45,591
- That's a rotten kind of chance
to be given. - Excuse me?

288
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:50,726
I wanted to be
a serious actress, you know.

289
00:22:50,805 --> 00:22:54,870
Had my chance once, too.
They don't give you another.

290
00:22:58,010 --> 00:22:59,968
That's why I'd like to help you.

291
00:23:01,047 --> 00:23:05,239
- You needn't feign interest in me.
- There's nothing feigned about it.

292
00:23:06,119 --> 00:23:09,942
Raised in cruelty and yet
you stood tall and thrived.

293
00:23:10,022 --> 00:23:11,578
That's...

294
00:23:12,458 --> 00:23:13,821
...uncommon.

295
00:23:18,231 --> 00:23:21,278
My mother did me
the great service of dying young.

296
00:23:25,371 --> 00:23:27,533
I was raised in the music halls.

297
00:24:22,429 --> 00:24:25,493
- You want to buy some sweets, miss?
- Hey, get out of here.

298
00:24:35,639 --> 00:24:37,327
What?

299
00:24:37,407 --> 00:24:40,506
- What a play.
- It was.

300
00:24:54,624 --> 00:24:57,628
It's halfway over, love.
Come back tomorrow.

301
00:24:59,762 --> 00:25:03,638
All right. Go on in. You can still
catch Leno if you're quick.

302
00:25:03,718 --> 00:25:05,598
God bless.

303
00:25:39,299 --> 00:25:41,364
All right, there we go!

304
00:25:44,504 --> 00:25:46,101
What fine manners.

305
00:25:46,181 --> 00:25:49,900
Such fine manners!
I feel as if I'm at a tea party.

306
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:54,601
Please note the oxtail
in the jelly tonight is three pence.

307
00:25:54,681 --> 00:25:57,240
- Now without any further ado...
- That's for later.

308
00:25:57,320 --> 00:26:00,014
may I introduce the man
of the hour...

309
00:26:00,094 --> 00:26:03,674
Mr. Dan Leno!

310
00:26:11,931 --> 00:26:14,464
Here we are again!

311
00:26:21,276 --> 00:26:25,045
<i>I burnt both my hands while a-trying</i>

312
00:26:25,125 --> 00:26:28,241
<i>To cook my old man's mutton broth</i>

313
00:26:28,322 --> 00:26:32,936
<i>My fat, boss-eyed baby was crying</i>

314
00:26:35,734 --> 00:26:38,990
<i>I believe she's a little bit off</i>

315
00:26:39,758 --> 00:26:43,844
- Mummy!
- <i>The meat all got burnt to a cinder</i>

316
00:26:43,925 --> 00:26:47,047
<i>Which made my old man very wild</i>

317
00:26:47,127 --> 00:26:51,048
<i>Then he threw the whole lot
through the winder</i>

318
00:26:51,128 --> 00:26:54,740
<i>And smashed me on the nose
with the child</i>

319
00:26:59,603 --> 00:27:02,807
<i>And the child began a-screaming</i>

320
00:27:02,887 --> 00:27:05,951
<i>As it never screamed before</i>

321
00:27:06,031 --> 00:27:10,659
<i>While my nose with claret was streaming</i>

322
00:27:12,176 --> 00:27:16,818
<i>He tried to dislocate my jaw</i>

323
00:27:18,818 --> 00:27:22,811
<i>He kicked me and punched me this morning</i>

324
00:27:22,891 --> 00:27:25,546
<i>And made my poor face such a fright</i>

325
00:27:25,626 --> 00:27:29,305
<i>He blacked both my eyes without warning</i>

326
00:27:29,385 --> 00:27:34,715
<i>But I'm waiting for him tonight</i>

327
00:27:34,794 --> 00:27:39,092
<i>He kicked me and punched me this morning</i>

328
00:27:39,172 --> 00:27:42,304
<i>And made my poor face such a fright</i>

329
00:27:42,384 --> 00:27:45,861
<i>He blacked both my eyes without warning</i>

330
00:27:46,151 --> 00:27:51,649
<i>But I'm waiting for him tonight</i>

331
00:27:59,237 --> 00:28:00,802
More!

332
00:28:08,179 --> 00:28:11,535
Pies, pies, pies, pies.
All in dire need of pies.

333
00:28:11,615 --> 00:28:14,372
I'll tell you what, dearie. Seeing
as you're here again, be a good girl.

334
00:28:14,452 --> 00:28:16,360
Give Uncle a hand.

335
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:18,858
Be careful with that.
All too good to drop.

336
00:28:18,938 --> 00:28:21,389
As the pregnant woman
said to the midwife!

337
00:28:23,728 --> 00:28:27,648
Here you are, Vic. A little bit
of what you fancy. John John.

338
00:28:29,267 --> 00:28:32,624
Aveline, dear, nice and hot,
just as you like it.

339
00:28:32,704 --> 00:28:34,777
But not quite so big.

340
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:38,737
Thanks, Uncle.

341
00:28:52,423 --> 00:28:54,778
Last one's for you, Mr. Leno.

342
00:28:54,859 --> 00:28:56,880
Mr. Leno, is it?

343
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:01,784
Did you find her at the grocers, Uncle?
She's certainly a green one.

344
00:29:01,864 --> 00:29:03,873
Now, now, girls.

345
00:29:05,902 --> 00:29:08,525
- What's your name?
- Lizzie, sir.

346
00:29:08,605 --> 00:29:10,460
Lambeth Marsh Lizzie.

347
00:29:10,541 --> 00:29:13,189
I thought I could smell marsh gas.

348
00:29:13,269 --> 00:29:17,333
Don't let 'em dumb you.
It's just their way. And call me Dan.

349
00:29:18,113 --> 00:29:22,573
This is Tommy Farr, theater manager
and keeper of the Bunce.

350
00:29:22,654 --> 00:29:25,718
Speaking of which, we owe you
something for your trouble.

351
00:29:30,327 --> 00:29:33,967
What in God's name did they have you
doing down there in those marshes?

352
00:29:35,965 --> 00:29:37,853
Digging graves.

353
00:29:37,933 --> 00:29:41,584
Five years it was before I found out
you're supposed to use a shovel.

354
00:29:42,304 --> 00:29:45,126
I like this one. Can you read?

355
00:29:45,206 --> 00:29:48,072
- Like a native.
- Here.

356
00:29:53,616 --> 00:29:57,673
"What's fame?
A fancy'd life in other's breath.

357
00:29:57,752 --> 00:30:00,710
A thing beyond us,
even before our death.

358
00:30:00,789 --> 00:30:06,282
All we feel of it begins and ends in
the small circle of our foes and friends."

359
00:30:06,961 --> 00:30:08,891
That's my favorite line.

360
00:30:09,331 --> 00:30:11,154
Alexander Pope.

361
00:30:12,933 --> 00:30:14,923
- Are you looking for work, Lizzie?
- Yeah.

362
00:30:15,003 --> 00:30:19,492
Only, our prompter ran off with a lion
comique. And it won't all be lavender.

363
00:30:19,573 --> 00:30:21,927
There'll be some fetch and carry,
but there's decent Bunce...

364
00:30:22,008 --> 00:30:24,024
and room in the digs
with the dancers.

365
00:30:26,314 --> 00:30:27,670
What do you say?

366
00:30:28,950 --> 00:30:34,942
How would you describe
your relationship with Dan Leno?

367
00:30:35,022 --> 00:30:36,977
We were friends, sir.

368
00:30:37,057 --> 00:30:40,705
And he was my mentor.
He took me under his wing.

369
00:30:40,784 --> 00:30:42,825
"No, Mrs. Killian"...

370
00:30:46,031 --> 00:30:49,289
Where did you learn to read
and write if you didn't go to school?

371
00:30:49,768 --> 00:30:53,181
My mother's Bible, I suppose.

372
00:30:54,976 --> 00:30:56,988
Oh, and speaking of books...

373
00:30:58,045 --> 00:31:00,898
- Oi. Thank you.
- What?

374
00:31:01,348 --> 00:31:04,813
Finished already?
That's the second this week.

375
00:31:06,784 --> 00:31:09,243
I think books might be my first love.

376
00:31:09,323 --> 00:31:12,746
And I've always heard it said
that first love is insatiable.

377
00:31:13,826 --> 00:31:18,340
Sod writing new gags, they can have
the milkmaid again tonight and like it.

378
00:31:18,630 --> 00:31:20,360
I want to show you something.

379
00:31:21,899 --> 00:31:24,037
- Where are we going?
- You'll see.

380
00:31:27,707 --> 00:31:29,596
A whole room?

381
00:31:29,877 --> 00:31:31,731
Full of books?

382
00:31:32,211 --> 00:31:34,309
Every inch of it.

383
00:31:36,881 --> 00:31:38,270
People come here just to read?

384
00:31:38,351 --> 00:31:41,974
To read. To learn. To create.

385
00:31:42,254 --> 00:31:45,176
It's like... a great furnace.

386
00:31:45,256 --> 00:31:48,546
I mean, the future is being forged here.

387
00:31:48,626 --> 00:31:52,610
Writers, philosophers, men of science.

388
00:31:52,690 --> 00:31:55,623
All the way down
to lowly clowns like me.

389
00:31:55,703 --> 00:31:57,825
The ladies' table is upstairs.

390
00:31:59,205 --> 00:32:02,027
Thanking you kindly, good sir.

391
00:32:02,107 --> 00:32:04,463
You were never more than friends?

392
00:32:04,543 --> 00:32:08,050
No, sir. I believe he felt
protective of me.

393
00:32:09,547 --> 00:32:14,038
The prosecution wishes to remind the court
that Mr. Leno was recently questioned...

394
00:32:14,118 --> 00:32:17,841
...in connection with
the "Limehouse Golem" murders.

395
00:32:17,921 --> 00:32:19,639
Objection, Your Honor!

396
00:32:19,724 --> 00:32:21,941
Order, order!

397
00:32:25,662 --> 00:32:27,319
Inspector Kildare!

398
00:32:27,399 --> 00:32:29,029
Kildare!

399
00:32:38,642 --> 00:32:42,500
Why was I not aware
that Dan Leno was previously a suspect?

400
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:46,139
You tell me, Kildare.
It was in every daily newspaper.

401
00:32:46,219 --> 00:32:48,838
But not in the brief you gave me.

402
00:32:48,918 --> 00:32:52,709
Well, he was eliminated from inquiries.
The report's on my desk somewhere.

403
00:32:52,788 --> 00:32:55,612
You didn't think
to place it in your files?

404
00:32:56,395 --> 00:32:59,296
The streets of London
run red with blood...

405
00:32:59,376 --> 00:33:01,860
and you concern yourself
with paperwork?

406
00:33:03,534 --> 00:33:06,256
You'd have made
a fine politician, Kildare...

407
00:33:06,336 --> 00:33:08,506
...were you not the topic of such...

408
00:33:09,406 --> 00:33:10,969
...speculation.

409
00:33:16,278 --> 00:33:20,235
I wouldn't read that.
Disgraceful lies, all of it.

410
00:33:20,315 --> 00:33:24,342
The poor woman spoke of misfortune and
cruelty and they've turned it upon her.

411
00:33:24,422 --> 00:33:26,603
Makes my blood boil.

412
00:33:28,493 --> 00:33:31,014
Seems your beloved Leno
wasn't actually a suspect.

413
00:33:31,094 --> 00:33:34,104
My beloved?
What man doesn't enjoy Dan Leno?

414
00:33:34,184 --> 00:33:36,420
One who doesn't care
for the music halls?

415
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:40,055
Well, I'll venture to say
you've not seen the right shows, sir.

416
00:33:40,135 --> 00:33:41,924
If you ever wish for a recommendation...

417
00:33:42,004 --> 00:33:46,177
He was questioned in regard
to Alice Stanton's gown.

418
00:33:46,257 --> 00:33:49,497
A label sewn into it
identified it as his...

419
00:33:49,577 --> 00:33:51,999
- ...a stage costume.
- So he knew her?

420
00:33:52,079 --> 00:33:55,670
"Leno stated that the dress was part
of a consignment of stage costumes...

421
00:33:55,749 --> 00:33:58,598
...he'd sold a year earlier to
a purveyor of secondhand clothes."

422
00:33:58,678 --> 00:34:01,844
- And he provided a receipt which proved it.
- Then it was merely a coincidence.

423
00:34:01,924 --> 00:34:03,296
Perhaps.

424
00:34:04,066 --> 00:34:08,683
As is perhaps the fact that
the purveyor of secondhand clothes...

425
00:34:09,262 --> 00:34:11,313
...was the late Mr. Gerrard...

426
00:34:11,393 --> 00:34:14,489
- ...murdered at Ratcliffe Highway.
- We should get a sample of his hand.

427
00:34:14,570 --> 00:34:17,091
Quite. And can we find out
what's happened to that dress?

428
00:34:17,171 --> 00:34:20,166
- It wasn't with the rest of the evidence.
- I'll look into it, sir.

429
00:34:30,734 --> 00:34:32,774
Why didn't you tell me
you questioned Dan Leno?

430
00:34:32,854 --> 00:34:35,644
- I haven't. Though I shall have to.
- In court they said you had.

431
00:34:35,723 --> 00:34:38,613
Not me. Before I joined the case.

432
00:34:39,593 --> 00:34:42,083
So is he a suspect or not?

433
00:34:43,063 --> 00:34:45,785
- Do you think he should be?
- Please don't play games with me.

434
00:34:45,865 --> 00:34:49,385
I have no desire to.
The Golem is still at large.

435
00:34:49,465 --> 00:34:52,700
Wasting my time could cost lives.

436
00:34:57,476 --> 00:34:59,699
Unless you are correct about my husband.

437
00:34:59,778 --> 00:35:02,579
If the Golem is no more,
then none are at risk.

438
00:35:04,451 --> 00:35:06,824
Besides yours...

439
00:35:06,904 --> 00:35:09,986
...you needn't hang, Mrs. Cree.

440
00:35:12,274 --> 00:35:14,161
Please call me Lizzie.

441
00:35:15,895 --> 00:35:19,818
- Just assist me in assisting you.
- I can't tell you what I don't know.

442
00:35:19,899 --> 00:35:23,207
All I ask is that you tell me
what you do.

443
00:35:25,569 --> 00:35:27,157
Where should I start?

444
00:35:27,238 --> 00:35:31,474
How you came to know John Cree, perhaps.

445
00:35:33,379 --> 00:35:37,070
<i>Jim is very partial to me!
Though never a word has he said.</i>

446
00:35:37,150 --> 00:35:40,913
Right now he's lodging with Mrs. Kelly.
Do you know Mrs. Kelly?

447
00:35:40,993 --> 00:35:44,943
Don't you know Mrs. Kelly?
Good life-a-mighty, don't look so simple.

448
00:35:45,023 --> 00:35:47,278
<i>Everybody</i> knows Mrs. Kelly.

449
00:35:47,358 --> 00:35:49,914
- Am I going too fast for you, love?
- You spoof it, I'll write it.

450
00:35:49,994 --> 00:35:52,917
She's a mean one, Mrs. Kelly.
She'll buy half a dozen oysters...

451
00:35:52,997 --> 00:35:56,287
...and eat them in front of a mirror
to make them look like a dozen.

452
00:35:56,367 --> 00:35:58,222
What about...

453
00:35:59,002 --> 00:36:02,463
"I saw her take a coin from her purse
the other day, and I swear...

454
00:36:02,543 --> 00:36:05,974
...I saw Queen Victoria blinking
at the sight of sunlight"?

455
00:36:07,879 --> 00:36:10,431
Are those petticoats ironed yet?

456
00:36:10,511 --> 00:36:14,949
Good. Then you can come
over here and lace me up.

457
00:36:20,190 --> 00:36:22,680
- Fuck off, Victor.
- Come on, dear.

458
00:36:22,759 --> 00:36:26,062
You know I can't see from the back row,
and I do so love a double act.

459
00:36:26,142 --> 00:36:29,975
- Victor, out, out! Come on.
- Just a joke, Dan.

460
00:36:30,666 --> 00:36:32,758
Get that, will you, Lizzie.

461
00:36:32,838 --> 00:36:35,269
That'll be the reporter
for my interview.

462
00:36:37,608 --> 00:36:41,031
- You're new.
- Lizzie. Seen you before, haven't I?

463
00:36:41,612 --> 00:36:44,635
- You work for <i>the Era.</i>
- I'm a playwright, but yes, indeed...

464
00:36:44,715 --> 00:36:48,520
<i>the Era puts food
on my table. For now.</i>

465
00:36:50,119 --> 00:36:51,907
John Cree.

466
00:36:51,988 --> 00:36:53,910
You got to sweep it.

467
00:36:55,090 --> 00:36:57,594
- Shall we?
- Can you help me dress, love?

468
00:36:59,194 --> 00:37:01,495
Threw me out the window.

469
00:37:03,434 --> 00:37:05,890
- The usual for everyone?
- Oh, yes, please, darling.

470
00:37:05,970 --> 00:37:08,212
- What about you, dear?
- A baked potato.

471
00:37:08,293 --> 00:37:12,195
You don't fancy a bit of meat tonight,
Lizzie? What's the matter, Dan?

472
00:37:12,275 --> 00:37:14,631
- She must be over 16.
- No, I mustn't.

473
00:37:14,710 --> 00:37:18,434
So, Lizzie, what's your act? Do tell.

474
00:37:18,914 --> 00:37:21,971
It's called
"Little Lizzie the Dogsbody."

475
00:37:22,051 --> 00:37:26,041
Yeah, I do all manner of gags
with an iron and a pile of dirty smalls.

476
00:37:26,121 --> 00:37:29,110
- Oh, that sounds extraordinary.
- It is.

477
00:37:29,190 --> 00:37:32,596
She's dumbing you, John.
She means she's the prompt.

478
00:37:32,676 --> 00:37:35,148
I was only saying earlier
you might make a good gagger.

479
00:37:35,228 --> 00:37:37,921
- She's got the dial for it, hasn't she, Uncle?
- Say that again.

480
00:37:38,002 --> 00:37:41,290
She's got the dial for it,
hasn't she, Uncle?

481
00:37:41,370 --> 00:37:42,459
Oh, thank you.

482
00:37:42,539 --> 00:37:46,228
I don't know where you put it all, Victor.
You must have hollow legs.

483
00:37:46,308 --> 00:37:48,931
I can hold as much as the next man,
thank you very much.

484
00:37:49,011 --> 00:37:51,012
Pour a quart in a pint pot,
you'll make a mess.

485
00:37:51,092 --> 00:37:55,336
Nonsense. I'm as right as rain. Can't
keep a good man down, as they say...

486
00:37:55,416 --> 00:37:58,147
...but I know where
you can put a good man up.

487
00:37:59,186 --> 00:38:02,343
- What in God's name is going on?
- Nothing.

488
00:38:02,423 --> 00:38:06,483
Lizzie stepped on my foot
by mistake. No harm done.

489
00:38:07,463 --> 00:38:09,554
I'm taking Lizzie home.

490
00:38:11,033 --> 00:38:14,536
- This is no place for an innocent young girl.
- Come, gentlemen. No harm done.

491
00:38:14,616 --> 00:38:17,257
- As the executioner said to the hanged man.
- I'll... I'll take her.

492
00:38:17,339 --> 00:38:19,595
- There's no need. I can walk alone.
- No, I'll not hear of it.

493
00:38:19,675 --> 00:38:22,496
Your food will get cold. I'll be quite safe.
Our digs are just around the corner.

494
00:38:22,576 --> 00:38:24,784
Then I'll be back in good time.

495
00:38:25,546 --> 00:38:28,034
Watch yourself, Victor.
John Cree's got a temper.

496
00:38:28,114 --> 00:38:29,978
I'm not afraid of him.

497
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:48,917
Lizzie.

498
00:38:50,303 --> 00:38:52,306
I'm afraid there's...

499
00:38:53,206 --> 00:38:54,746
...awful news.

500
00:38:54,826 --> 00:38:58,898
Victor was found at the bottom
of the stairs last night.

501
00:38:59,179 --> 00:39:00,381
<i>Lizzie...</i>

502
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:04,339
...are you trying to tell me
you suspected John Cree?

503
00:39:04,419 --> 00:39:06,907
I didn't say that.
I merely said he was protective.

504
00:39:06,987 --> 00:39:09,577
You said the same of Dan Leno.

505
00:39:09,657 --> 00:39:11,471
I seem to ignite the urge in men.

506
00:39:14,394 --> 00:39:16,617
He was a terrible little turd.

507
00:39:17,397 --> 00:39:20,186
But he was our terrible little turd.

508
00:39:20,266 --> 00:39:23,111
That's it, cheer up.

509
00:39:25,103 --> 00:39:30,362
I've suggested that we make
tonight's show a special tribute.

510
00:39:31,192 --> 00:39:33,246
We'll give him a grand send-off...

511
00:39:34,010 --> 00:39:35,602
...won't we?

512
00:39:35,682 --> 00:39:38,037
<i>Did you ever speak of it with John?</i>

513
00:39:38,117 --> 00:39:41,141
No. I never spoke of it to anyone.

514
00:39:41,221 --> 00:39:43,577
I preferred to chalk it up to fate.

515
00:39:43,657 --> 00:39:46,101
Would you rather owe your happiness
to simple good fortune...

516
00:39:46,181 --> 00:39:49,030
...or to an unspeakable act of violence?

517
00:39:49,311 --> 00:39:52,473
Little Victor's death
brought you happiness?

518
00:39:53,665 --> 00:39:56,325
<i>Little Victor's death gave me life.</i>

519
00:40:16,586 --> 00:40:18,542
The people come through
the doors and they laugh.

520
00:40:18,622 --> 00:40:21,946
Dan, I was hoping you'd wipe your ass
with the papers. You don't read them.

521
00:40:22,026 --> 00:40:26,360
Dan? Do you think I could pay
my respects to Little Victor, too?

522
00:40:27,397 --> 00:40:31,921
Good God. This is a funny thing.
What a funny thing.

523
00:40:32,001 --> 00:40:35,291
Just a little song. A blue one maybe,
Victor would like that.

524
00:40:35,371 --> 00:40:38,567
A salty sailor act, as if I were a man.
It could be a scream.

525
00:40:38,647 --> 00:40:41,134
Go on, then, Lizzie. Give it a try.

526
00:40:41,214 --> 00:40:44,031
Isn't that costume
a little bit small for you, dear?

527
00:40:44,111 --> 00:40:46,145
That's the point.

528
00:40:59,036 --> 00:41:03,921
<i>A regular farmer's daughter
thought she'd like to come to town</i>

529
00:41:04,001 --> 00:41:07,966
<i>But what did she know about railways?</i>

530
00:41:08,046 --> 00:41:12,470
<i>She jumped up on the engine
but the stoker shoved her down</i>

531
00:41:12,550 --> 00:41:16,643
<i>What did she know about railways?</i>

532
00:41:16,722 --> 00:41:20,867
<i>A guard came up and spoke to her
and she sat sobbing there</i>

533
00:41:20,947 --> 00:41:25,149
<i>Asked her if she'd a ticket,
but she answered with a stare</i>

534
00:41:25,229 --> 00:41:31,099
<i>Said he, "You can't go up to town
until you've paid your fare</i>

535
00:41:31,879 --> 00:41:34,881
<i>But what did she know...</i> excuse me...

536
00:41:34,961 --> 00:41:38,420
<i>About railways?</i>

537
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:44,002
<i>So she arrived at Euston
by the midnight train</i>

538
00:41:44,082 --> 00:41:47,721
<i>But when she got to the wicket there
someone wanted to punch her ticket</i>

539
00:41:47,801 --> 00:41:51,463
<i>The guards and porters
came round by the score</i>

540
00:41:51,543 --> 00:41:55,016
<i>And she told them all she'd never
had her ticket punched before</i>

541
00:41:55,096 --> 00:42:01,568
<i>Yeah, she told them all she'd never
had her ticket punched before</i>

542
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:14,089
Oblige again!

543
00:42:14,269 --> 00:42:17,892
Lizzie, oblige again! They want more!

544
00:42:17,972 --> 00:42:21,176
- I don't have any more.
- You have them!

545
00:42:37,422 --> 00:42:39,845
Would you look at these
rotten cotton gloves?

546
00:42:40,845 --> 00:42:43,261
That saltwater will shrink anything.

547
00:42:46,933 --> 00:42:50,266
Least that's what the ladies
down at the docks tell me.

548
00:42:58,842 --> 00:43:00,692
I just looked at the gloves
and they looked so absurd...

549
00:43:00,771 --> 00:43:03,568
- ...that the line just came to me like that.
- "Them rotten cotton gloves!"

550
00:43:03,649 --> 00:43:07,239
It could be your catchphrase. No need
to dip into the blue bag so much.

551
00:43:07,319 --> 00:43:09,978
They loved it. They loved it all.
They love you.

552
00:43:10,058 --> 00:43:12,098
- And who wouldn't.
- Uncle!

553
00:43:12,178 --> 00:43:14,615
Careful, Uncle.
With Lizzie in that getup...

554
00:43:14,696 --> 00:43:17,117
...anyone looking over might think
you have an eye for the boys.

555
00:43:17,197 --> 00:43:20,419
Let them think what they like.
More drinks, please!

556
00:43:20,499 --> 00:43:24,333
Little Victor wouldn't have wanted any of us
standing up at the end of the night.

557
00:43:25,971 --> 00:43:30,812
I'm tired, I'm afraid.
Walk me home, will you, John?

558
00:43:32,377 --> 00:43:34,274
I'll come back.

559
00:43:38,414 --> 00:43:40,627
Why are you still wearing your costume?

560
00:43:40,706 --> 00:43:43,143
I hoped it might keep the men away.

561
00:43:44,223 --> 00:43:46,797
You prefer the girls, Lizzie?

562
00:43:48,027 --> 00:43:49,548
Nothing wrong in that if you do.

563
00:43:49,628 --> 00:43:52,318
Come on, no need to make something
from nothing. You dress like a girl.

564
00:43:52,398 --> 00:43:54,191
Yeah, on stage.

565
00:43:57,635 --> 00:44:02,126
Well, if you really care,
maybe I like how I felt on stage.

566
00:44:02,456 --> 00:44:04,277
I care.

567
00:44:04,608 --> 00:44:07,056
I care to see you happy.

568
00:44:08,145 --> 00:44:09,667
Tonight...

569
00:44:10,749 --> 00:44:12,806
...tonight, you look happy.

570
00:44:13,785 --> 00:44:16,509
We still need handwriting samples
from Marx, Gissing, and Leno.

571
00:44:16,589 --> 00:44:20,218
- Did you speak with the maid again?
- Aveline Ortega? I did, sir.

572
00:44:20,298 --> 00:44:23,280
- She won't hear a word said against him.
- You showed her the journal entries?

573
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:26,716
- She swore the writing wasn't his.
- If Cree were our Golem...

574
00:44:26,796 --> 00:44:29,586
...it would certainly make sense
of him destroying his papers.

575
00:44:29,666 --> 00:44:32,291
And God knows as a failed playwright,
Cree must've grown sick...

576
00:44:32,371 --> 00:44:35,696
...of watching his famous wife
earn London's attention.

577
00:44:36,771 --> 00:44:39,842
- Do you fancy another?
- Trying to get me drunk?

578
00:44:40,545 --> 00:44:42,276
A pint, please.

579
00:44:44,581 --> 00:44:47,640
It was a joke. Didn't mean nothing.

580
00:44:48,969 --> 00:44:51,201
I didn't mean to offend.

581
00:44:53,556 --> 00:44:55,009
I'm...

582
00:44:56,009 --> 00:44:57,583
...on your side.

583
00:45:04,966 --> 00:45:07,523
It's not the Golem haunting you, is it?

584
00:45:07,603 --> 00:45:11,229
- It's her.
- She's going to hang, Flood.

585
00:45:11,409 --> 00:45:14,032
We have to rule out the other suspects.

586
00:45:15,142 --> 00:45:18,446
Well, I may have found
an eyewitness in Limehouse, sir.

587
00:45:18,745 --> 00:45:21,179
<i>Scaoil liom! Scaoil liom!</i>

588
00:45:22,151 --> 00:45:26,341
You're not in any trouble.
I'm taking you to someone who can translate.

589
00:45:26,421 --> 00:45:28,015
Understand?

590
00:45:30,660 --> 00:45:33,181
This is... this is sister Mary.

591
00:45:33,261 --> 00:45:35,723
<i>T� mo mh�thair tar �is m� a dh�ol cheana.</i>

592
00:45:35,803 --> 00:45:38,419
<i>T� fear do m'fhuadach ar mo l� breithe.</i>

593
00:45:38,499 --> 00:45:40,688
The child says she's not for sale.

594
00:45:40,767 --> 00:45:43,392
Her mum's got a fella
taking her on her next birthday.

595
00:45:43,472 --> 00:45:45,394
No, no, please.

596
00:45:45,474 --> 00:45:50,779
Tell her my colleague showed her
some photographs, suspects in a crime.

597
00:45:50,860 --> 00:45:55,688
She seemed to recognize one of them.
We need to know where and when she saw him.

598
00:45:57,551 --> 00:46:00,741
Sir, this is where Solomon Weil lived!

599
00:46:00,821 --> 00:46:02,976
The scholar, the third victim.

600
00:46:03,056 --> 00:46:05,555
- Which house number did he...
- Number 4.

601
00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:14,258
This man?

602
00:46:16,438 --> 00:46:18,693
Families starve in the streets.

603
00:46:18,773 --> 00:46:21,663
Women are used up
and thrown away, then you...

604
00:46:21,742 --> 00:46:24,665
...you persecute one
who fights for the people.

605
00:46:24,744 --> 00:46:28,071
You're not fit to clean the boots
of a man like Karl Marx.

606
00:46:36,121 --> 00:46:37,411
So...

607
00:46:38,091 --> 00:46:41,780
...London declares that the Jew
was murdered by a Jewish monster?

608
00:46:41,860 --> 00:46:44,952
And so absolves itself
of all responsibility.

609
00:46:45,433 --> 00:46:47,395
Make no mistake, gentlemen...

610
00:46:47,475 --> 00:46:50,891
...it is not Solomon Weil
who's mutilated and murdered here.

611
00:46:50,971 --> 00:46:52,360
It is the Jew.

612
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:55,129
None of the Golem's
other victims were Hebrews, sir.

613
00:46:55,209 --> 00:46:57,317
But do you not see?

614
00:46:57,397 --> 00:47:00,966
This murderer strikes
at the very symbols of the city...

615
00:47:01,046 --> 00:47:03,138
...the Jew, the whore.

616
00:47:03,218 --> 00:47:07,707
They are the sacrificial tributes
in this labyrinth of London.

617
00:47:08,938 --> 00:47:13,186
And so of course
must be ritually butchered.

618
00:47:22,134 --> 00:47:24,565
What is it that you wish me to write?

619
00:47:26,837 --> 00:47:29,596
"The morning herald...

620
00:47:30,476 --> 00:47:33,907
...had declined to review my debut."

621
00:47:34,646 --> 00:47:37,138
<i>All that work for nothing.</i>

622
00:47:38,149 --> 00:47:41,285
<i>I resolved that this time
I'd put on a show...</i>

623
00:47:41,365 --> 00:47:43,807
<i>...that everyone would notice.</i>

624
00:47:45,625 --> 00:47:50,859
<i>A fine opening act
of the crowd-pleasing sort.</i>

625
00:48:19,624 --> 00:48:22,747
<i>And I went on to create a spectacle...</i>

626
00:48:22,827 --> 00:48:26,246
<i>...that no beholder would ever forget.</i>

627
00:48:32,768 --> 00:48:35,626
"It was all too easy to kill a whore.

628
00:48:35,705 --> 00:48:39,328
Tonight I would return to kill the Jew."

629
00:48:39,408 --> 00:48:43,131
This is absurd. You didn't do this.

630
00:48:43,211 --> 00:48:44,745
Of course I didn't.

631
00:48:47,952 --> 00:48:52,833
Would you agree with the defendant
that in the weeks before his death...

632
00:48:53,123 --> 00:48:56,684
...Mr. Cree had seemed "morbid"?

633
00:48:56,763 --> 00:48:58,583
No, sir.

634
00:48:58,663 --> 00:49:00,917
He was in good spirits.

635
00:49:02,398 --> 00:49:06,888
And how would you describe relations
between Mr. Cree and his wife?

636
00:49:06,968 --> 00:49:11,660
Not especially good, sir.
They saw very little of each other.

637
00:49:11,739 --> 00:49:16,733
And yet Mrs. Cree insisted
on preparing him a nightly draft?

638
00:49:16,814 --> 00:49:18,335
That is correct, sir.

639
00:49:18,415 --> 00:49:21,568
And did you hear Mr. Cree
express suspicions...

640
00:49:21,649 --> 00:49:26,041
...that she might have tainted
this draft with something?

641
00:49:26,121 --> 00:49:27,876
Not quite.

642
00:49:27,956 --> 00:49:30,349
Though just before his death...

643
00:49:30,429 --> 00:49:32,891
...I overheard them in dispute.

644
00:49:32,971 --> 00:49:37,662
I heard Mr. Cree say,
"You devil. You have done this."

645
00:49:43,235 --> 00:49:46,875
She may as well have placed
the noose around my neck herself.

646
00:49:48,210 --> 00:49:52,734
You must make it plain to the jury that
there was bad blood between the two of you.

647
00:49:52,814 --> 00:49:56,405
- Romantic jealousy.
- I never stood between them.

648
00:49:56,485 --> 00:49:59,438
I'm sure my feelings on intimacy
are plain to you by now.

649
00:49:59,518 --> 00:50:01,876
John was free to court
Aveline if he wanted to.

650
00:50:01,956 --> 00:50:04,152
But he had his heart set on you.

651
00:50:04,232 --> 00:50:06,681
I did nothing to encourage it.

652
00:50:06,760 --> 00:50:09,849
My stage career had taken off.
I rarely saw him.

653
00:50:10,829 --> 00:50:12,654
And then...

654
00:50:13,133 --> 00:50:15,758
out of the blue,
he invited me for supper.

655
00:50:16,669 --> 00:50:19,995
- Your new show's tremendous.
- We feel awful intruding.

656
00:50:20,075 --> 00:50:22,931
- We simply adore you.
- Thank you.

657
00:50:24,011 --> 00:50:27,268
- Thank you. Thank you very much.
- I'll treasure this.

658
00:50:27,348 --> 00:50:29,971
- I can't believe it.
- What a surprise!

659
00:50:30,750 --> 00:50:32,322
As I was saying...

660
00:50:32,402 --> 00:50:36,309
...I have reached the end of
the first act of "Misery Junction."

661
00:50:36,389 --> 00:50:40,309
But I can't quite decide what to do
with my heroine next, and...

662
00:50:40,389 --> 00:50:42,581
...I thought you might advise me.

663
00:50:42,661 --> 00:50:46,316
- I'm flattered.
- The heroine's name is Katherine Dove.

664
00:50:46,397 --> 00:50:49,819
When I began, I had her in
the workhouses, but now I have her...

665
00:50:49,899 --> 00:50:52,726
...sewing sailcloth on the docks.

666
00:50:53,407 --> 00:50:56,863
My mother died
when I was young. Her kidneys.

667
00:50:56,943 --> 00:51:00,568
- It was so fast.
- Orphaned and alone at 14.

668
00:51:02,047 --> 00:51:06,105
- Is Katherine Dove an orphan?
- She could be.

669
00:51:06,185 --> 00:51:09,273
But you've still not told me what to do
with her by the end of the first act.

670
00:51:09,353 --> 00:51:11,443
- What's your dilemma?
- At the moment...

671
00:51:11,523 --> 00:51:15,476
...she's very close
to salvation and ruin, and...

672
00:51:15,556 --> 00:51:17,748
...I'm wondering if I should rescue her.

673
00:51:17,828 --> 00:51:19,354
Yes.

674
00:51:19,733 --> 00:51:21,755
Have her become successful.

675
00:51:21,835 --> 00:51:24,106
Loved by her audiences.

676
00:51:24,186 --> 00:51:27,627
But she's very much alone.
Living in theatrical digs, hand to mouth.

677
00:51:27,706 --> 00:51:30,496
- It's a life of degradation.
- Come on.

678
00:51:30,576 --> 00:51:33,812
People love to see degradation upon
the stage. It's what they pay for.

679
00:51:33,893 --> 00:51:36,669
Yeah, but they expect to see
a happy ending.

680
00:51:36,748 --> 00:51:39,204
And Katherine deserves a protector.

681
00:51:39,284 --> 00:51:40,804
She does.

682
00:51:40,885 --> 00:51:43,106
Her manager, perhaps.

683
00:51:43,186 --> 00:51:46,220
- Someone kindly, like Uncle.
- No, an elderly character...

684
00:51:46,300 --> 00:51:49,649
...the audience would know he
wouldn't live to see her into old age.

685
00:51:49,728 --> 00:51:52,717
A friend, then. A comic, maybe.

686
00:51:52,797 --> 00:51:55,088
I would like to give her a suitor.

687
00:51:55,938 --> 00:51:58,907
Someone who cares fiercely
for her well-being.

688
00:51:58,987 --> 00:52:00,876
A white knight.

689
00:52:01,306 --> 00:52:03,177
What do you think?

690
00:52:05,243 --> 00:52:08,106
I think Katherine Dove
can look out for herself.

691
00:52:10,810 --> 00:52:13,503
In the bowl. Yes, there we go.

692
00:52:13,584 --> 00:52:15,941
Get it out. That's it.

693
00:52:16,889 --> 00:52:18,392
Gin.

694
00:52:20,424 --> 00:52:23,683
Down here. There we go.

695
00:52:24,563 --> 00:52:28,563
God. I think I put my back out
carrying her up the stairs.

696
00:52:31,367 --> 00:52:34,545
I see you decided to dress
as a woman this evening.

697
00:52:34,871 --> 00:52:37,007
Can't wear a costume
out to supper, can I?

698
00:52:37,087 --> 00:52:39,104
Wouldn't be the first time.

699
00:52:47,382 --> 00:52:49,571
Be careful of that one, Lizzie.

700
00:52:49,651 --> 00:52:54,478
Don't lead him up the garden path unless
you're prepared to be dragged indoors.

701
00:52:54,558 --> 00:52:56,448
He offered me the lead
in "Misery Junction."

702
00:52:56,528 --> 00:52:59,158
He'll expect something in return.

703
00:53:07,669 --> 00:53:10,152
You don't need him, Lizzie.

704
00:53:10,972 --> 00:53:13,003
You did all this on your own.

705
00:53:16,410 --> 00:53:18,301
I could do more.

706
00:53:19,681 --> 00:53:21,540
Could be a real actress.

707
00:53:22,519 --> 00:53:26,586
Show the world what people
like us are really capable of.

708
00:53:28,758 --> 00:53:30,592
I just need a chance.

709
00:53:33,994 --> 00:53:36,918
Here we sit, the two most
famous faces on the stage...

710
00:53:36,998 --> 00:53:39,856
...and you suggest the world
conspires to oppress us.

711
00:53:41,136 --> 00:53:44,001
Remember that book you lent me? Pope?

712
00:53:44,081 --> 00:53:48,329
In the temple of fame, some people's names
are carved in stone and others in ice.

713
00:53:49,309 --> 00:53:51,197
We're clowns, Dan.

714
00:53:52,134 --> 00:53:53,943
We'll be forgotten.

715
00:53:57,318 --> 00:53:59,941
If you think a man like John Cree
is going to change that...

716
00:54:00,021 --> 00:54:02,286
...I don't have the breath to argue.

717
00:54:04,725 --> 00:54:09,617
And you know she's got a soft spot for him.
And whatever her faults, she's family.

718
00:54:10,547 --> 00:54:13,413
And we look out for each other,
don't we?

719
00:54:20,139 --> 00:54:22,498
The big finale is the hanging.
We've a life-size gallows.

720
00:54:22,578 --> 00:54:25,635
I'll wear this harness, concealed, and then
drop right through the trap just there.

721
00:54:25,714 --> 00:54:28,584
- Looks just like a real hanging.
- You sure it's safe, this contraption?

722
00:54:28,664 --> 00:54:32,905
- You're not wearing a real noose, are you?
- The noose is real but the fall is broken...

723
00:54:32,985 --> 00:54:35,775
- ...by the harness.
- Where's Lizzie?

724
00:54:35,855 --> 00:54:38,616
Up above giving John Cree
an interview for <i>the Era.</i>

725
00:54:38,695 --> 00:54:41,848
- Is that what they call it?
- I'll go and tell her to hurry up.

726
00:54:41,928 --> 00:54:45,984
The play's a shocker, but a spoof shocker,
the way only our marvelous company can do it.

727
00:54:46,064 --> 00:54:49,687
Dan wrote it. It's based on
the Ratcliffe Highway murders of 1811.

728
00:54:49,767 --> 00:54:51,189
- John Williams.
- Pardon?

729
00:54:51,269 --> 00:54:54,228
- The killer's name was John Williams.
- Quite. But much of it is fiction.

730
00:54:54,308 --> 00:54:57,197
It's all great fun, and terribly gory.
You must put that in for your readers.

731
00:54:57,277 --> 00:54:59,700
Dan says everybody thrills
to gore these days.

732
00:54:59,780 --> 00:55:01,435
Let's have you finished, John.

733
00:55:01,515 --> 00:55:04,170
She's not even ready and
she's on stage in 10 minutes.

734
00:55:04,250 --> 00:55:06,705
We can't have the star late
for the first performance.

735
00:55:06,786 --> 00:55:09,441
Dan's still the star. Always will be.

736
00:55:09,521 --> 00:55:13,189
Thought I felt my ears burning.
Did anyone check the safety?

737
00:55:13,269 --> 00:55:15,913
Of course. Wouldn't let anything
happen to our Lizzie, would we?

738
00:55:15,993 --> 00:55:18,650
- How's the crowd?
- Excellent. Great number of Jews.

739
00:55:18,729 --> 00:55:21,118
I believe it's one of their holidays.

740
00:55:21,198 --> 00:55:24,224
You should speak to them in Yiddish.
They will love it.

741
00:55:24,304 --> 00:55:26,025
Wish them...

742
00:55:26,106 --> 00:55:28,170
<i>"...meesa meschina."</i>

743
00:55:33,345 --> 00:55:36,577
Welcome, brave hearts,
to an evening of horror.

744
00:55:42,554 --> 00:55:44,276
Our play's about to begin...

745
00:55:45,455 --> 00:55:47,378
...but first, ladies and gentlemen...

746
00:55:47,458 --> 00:55:51,582
...and those not unconnected with
a certain historical chosen race...

747
00:55:51,662 --> 00:55:55,143
...may I wish you all
from the bottom of my heart...

748
00:55:55,733 --> 00:55:57,923
<i>...meesa meschina.</i>

749
00:55:58,303 --> 00:56:00,335
That is <i>mashugana!</i>

750
00:56:06,976 --> 00:56:08,999
What did you say that for?

751
00:56:09,079 --> 00:56:12,311
- What happened?
- Lizzie wished the Jews a sudden death!

752
00:56:13,350 --> 00:56:15,801
Here we are again!

753
00:56:20,202 --> 00:56:22,220
It was only a lark, Lizzie.

754
00:56:29,233 --> 00:56:32,278
I came back at once to see
if you were all right.

755
00:56:57,594 --> 00:57:00,016
<i>And after that, you began courting?</i>

756
00:57:01,197 --> 00:57:02,849
After a fashion.

757
00:57:02,929 --> 00:57:06,957
I could never love John enough
to give him what he really wanted.

758
00:57:07,337 --> 00:57:10,026
But you grew to love him?

759
00:57:11,246 --> 00:57:13,563
I wanted to be in his play.

760
00:57:14,493 --> 00:57:18,066
He wanted the gratification
of plucking a poor needy girl...

761
00:57:18,146 --> 00:57:20,610
...from misery and saving her.

762
00:57:22,416 --> 00:57:24,665
We used one another equally.

763
00:57:25,818 --> 00:57:28,626
Perhaps that's the best
that can be said of any coupling.

764
00:57:29,865 --> 00:57:32,315
That's a very dim view.

765
00:57:33,094 --> 00:57:35,613
If you seek a dim view,
be sure to ask a comedian.

766
00:57:46,039 --> 00:57:49,030
Alice Stanton's dress finally showed up.

767
00:57:49,110 --> 00:57:52,574
Improperly archived,
like everything else here.

768
00:57:56,080 --> 00:57:58,115
Been at the jail again?

769
00:58:00,921 --> 00:58:02,978
Anything more on Cree?

770
00:58:03,458 --> 00:58:06,714
Only that he was a manipulative ass
who fancied himself as a White Knight.

771
00:58:06,794 --> 00:58:11,653
I meant as relating to our case.
The Golem. Remember him?

772
00:58:11,732 --> 00:58:13,404
Cree knew of the murderer John Williams.

773
00:58:13,484 --> 00:58:16,587
Yet, apparently, so did Dan Leno. In fact,
Leno wrote a whole play about the fellow.

774
00:58:16,667 --> 00:58:18,240
Golem suspect who is alive.

775
00:58:18,320 --> 00:58:21,074
- That would be bad news.
- For his next victim, certainly.

776
00:58:21,154 --> 00:58:23,596
And for you. Or do you no longer care
what becomes of your career?

777
00:58:23,675 --> 00:58:25,849
- I've a job to do and I'm doing it.
- And which job would that be?

778
00:58:25,929 --> 00:58:28,870
Watch your tongue, Flood.
Do I need to remind you of your position?

779
00:58:28,950 --> 00:58:33,094
That may be helpful. Because
there are times when I'm confused...

780
00:58:33,174 --> 00:58:36,644
...as to whether we're here to find
the Golem or to save Elizabeth.

781
00:58:36,723 --> 00:58:38,629
Perhaps we'll do both!

782
00:58:39,359 --> 00:58:41,191
Who knows...

783
00:58:45,564 --> 00:58:47,786
Dear God, how many pockets
did Leno need?

784
00:58:47,866 --> 00:58:51,210
He tosses things into the crowd.
Sweeties. Flowers. Undergarments.

785
00:58:51,290 --> 00:58:54,092
Sounds hilarious.
Didn't Roberts empty the contents?

786
00:58:54,172 --> 00:58:57,082
The coroner's office did it.
Why? Did they miss something?

787
00:59:10,356 --> 00:59:13,312
8 Gower Place? Why do I know that?

788
00:59:13,392 --> 00:59:17,775
Perhaps because we're due a visit.
It's George Gissing's address.

789
00:59:19,263 --> 00:59:22,786
His wife gave him an alibi for the night
of the Ratcliffe Highway murders...

790
00:59:22,866 --> 00:59:25,532
...but she seemed fond of her drink.

791
00:59:33,078 --> 00:59:35,467
We need to talk to Mr. Gissing, madam.

792
00:59:35,547 --> 00:59:37,637
George isn't here. He just left.

793
00:59:37,716 --> 00:59:39,937
Do you know where he was going?

794
00:59:40,017 --> 00:59:42,281
Limehouse, perhaps?

795
01:00:04,375 --> 01:00:07,715
Not yet. I'm interested
to see where he goes.

796
01:00:07,795 --> 01:00:11,428
What business a scholar has
in the streets of Limehouse.

797
01:00:51,053 --> 01:00:54,537
- Madam, we're from Scotland Yard.
- We're just a pharmacy. You go away!

798
01:00:54,617 --> 01:00:56,453
Check my record!

799
01:00:59,377 --> 01:01:03,681
Our business is with Mr. Gissing,
the man who just entered, not you.

800
01:01:07,003 --> 01:01:10,307
Good customer. He keep his work here.

801
01:01:13,409 --> 01:01:16,574
Always working. Writing.

802
01:01:19,474 --> 01:01:23,303
Mr. Gissing, I'm Detective
Inspector Kildare of Scotland Yard.

803
01:01:23,384 --> 01:01:27,850
Perhaps you could explain how this came to
be in the possession of a murdered woman.

804
01:01:29,822 --> 01:01:32,315
I'm afraid you'll find
my address in the pockets...

805
01:01:32,395 --> 01:01:34,917
of a great many women
in this area, sir.

806
01:01:34,997 --> 01:01:38,020
My wife, Nell, is in the habit
of going missing.

807
01:01:38,100 --> 01:01:41,489
I give my address so that
they may contact me if they see her.

808
01:01:41,570 --> 01:01:45,243
Let us just say my wife
used to ply the same trade.

809
01:01:46,273 --> 01:01:49,197
- You don't seem in the least
bit surprised. - By what?

810
01:01:49,277 --> 01:01:52,900
That a gentleman like me, a scholar,
should have wed a fallen woman.

811
01:01:52,980 --> 01:01:56,512
Why would anyone be surprised?
The world is full of men...

812
01:01:56,592 --> 01:01:58,973
- ...like you, Mr. Gissing.
- I beg your pardon?

813
01:01:59,053 --> 01:02:02,908
Men who feign generosity when what
they really seek is congratulation.

814
01:02:02,988 --> 01:02:05,413
Men who play God by saving lives.

815
01:02:05,493 --> 01:02:07,782
Is it really so different, I wonder...

816
01:02:07,862 --> 01:02:11,206
- ...from playing God by taking them?
- I am not a murderer, sir.

817
01:02:11,466 --> 01:02:15,039
Then perhaps you will write
the words that I dictate?

818
01:02:15,269 --> 01:02:17,658
Let's get this thing done.

819
01:02:17,737 --> 01:02:20,815
"September 10, 1880.

820
01:02:22,694 --> 01:02:24,759
My public debut...

821
01:02:24,842 --> 01:02:27,601
...had garnered rave reviews."

822
01:02:27,680 --> 01:02:31,571
I could scarcely wait to begin
work on my next creation...

823
01:02:31,651 --> 01:02:34,342
but there was time
to pass before dark...

824
01:02:34,422 --> 01:02:38,187
<i>...so I paid a visit
to the Ratcliffe Highway shop.</i>

825
01:02:45,229 --> 01:02:47,887
<i>I bought some cufflinks
from the owner's wife.</i>

826
01:02:47,967 --> 01:02:50,156
<i>I could tell that when the time came...</i>

827
01:02:50,236 --> 01:02:53,900
<i>...she would make a fine player
in my magnum opus.</i>

828
01:03:28,020 --> 01:03:30,278
You're not the Jew from the library.

829
01:03:31,408 --> 01:03:34,101
Well... no matter.

830
01:03:34,881 --> 01:03:37,570
Who are you? What do you want?

831
01:03:37,650 --> 01:03:39,905
I have come to discourse with you.

832
01:03:39,985 --> 01:03:43,034
About death and everlasting life.

833
01:03:44,687 --> 01:03:46,243
Herein...

834
01:03:46,324 --> 01:03:48,434
...lies the secret.

835
01:03:57,766 --> 01:04:00,823
<i>It was here that I read
of the mythical Golem...</i>

836
01:04:00,903 --> 01:04:03,880
<i>a homunculus of clay
given life by man.</i>

837
01:04:04,843 --> 01:04:08,699
<i>How could any Londoner fail
to delight in this piece of theater?</i>

838
01:04:08,779 --> 01:04:12,358
<i>I could even see myself appearing
before the next unfortunate...</i>

839
01:04:12,438 --> 01:04:15,271
<i>...with mallet in hand exclaiming...</i>

840
01:04:15,352 --> 01:04:17,833
<i>"...Here we are again."</i>

841
01:04:20,957 --> 01:04:24,027
- May I go now?
- What?

842
01:04:24,427 --> 01:04:27,897
- Oh, yes, I'm sorry.
- Why would you be thinking of me still?

843
01:04:27,977 --> 01:04:30,253
My hand doesn't match at all.
You know I'm innocent.

844
01:04:30,333 --> 01:04:33,929
I know. I was reading what you wrote.
You were in my mind. I'm sorry.

845
01:04:34,009 --> 01:04:37,195
- Something I missed.
- Oh, I see. What is it?

846
01:04:37,275 --> 01:04:40,491
A line from the journal.

847
01:04:41,611 --> 01:04:46,102
"I bought some cufflinks
from the owner's wife."

848
01:04:47,082 --> 01:04:49,708
<i>On September the 10th,
the Golem made a purchase...</i>

849
01:04:49,788 --> 01:04:52,217
<i>...from the Ratcliffe Highway shop.</i>

850
01:05:13,975 --> 01:05:17,666
<i>A new production of "Bluebeard"
opens this weekend...</i>

851
01:05:17,746 --> 01:05:23,820
...and all of London longs to see
the great Dan Leno performing it.

852
01:05:24,553 --> 01:05:29,378
But I know they yearn
for more potent excitements.

853
01:05:30,458 --> 01:05:35,716
This is pantomime in its purest form.

854
01:05:36,600 --> 01:05:40,356
I could even see myself appearing
before the next unfortunate...

855
01:05:40,436 --> 01:05:43,291
with a mallet in my hand,
exclaiming...

856
01:05:43,371 --> 01:05:45,869
"...here we are again!"

857
01:05:53,179 --> 01:05:57,271
<i>What strange coincidence
and delight to discover...</i>

858
01:05:57,351 --> 01:05:59,507
<i>...on the streets of Limehouse...</i>

859
01:05:59,587 --> 01:06:03,676
<i>...a whore wearing a costume
I remembered well.</i>

860
01:06:04,407 --> 01:06:08,283
<i>She was a player waiting for a role.</i>

861
01:06:08,363 --> 01:06:11,586
<i>Of course, I obliged her.</i>

862
01:06:11,666 --> 01:06:15,557
The public yearned
for the next installment.

863
01:06:15,637 --> 01:06:19,335
And one should never keep
an audience waiting.

864
01:06:22,809 --> 01:06:25,565
<i>We need to forget about Cree
and concentrate on Leno.</i>

865
01:06:25,645 --> 01:06:29,802
The Golem even imagined himself
saying, "Here we are again."

866
01:06:29,882 --> 01:06:33,406
I know, but apparently everyone
knows Leno's catch-phrase.

867
01:06:33,486 --> 01:06:36,549
There's Alice Stanton's dress
and the fact he knew Mr. Gerrard.

868
01:06:36,629 --> 01:06:38,913
We're all part of London's tapestry.

869
01:06:38,993 --> 01:06:42,092
Sometimes threads get crossed.

870
01:06:44,397 --> 01:06:46,295
Good Lord!

871
01:06:50,134 --> 01:06:53,473
We should buy tickets.
I'd be intrigued to see how it ends.

872
01:06:53,553 --> 01:06:56,792
- I could recommend many better shows.
- I was making a joke, Flood.

873
01:06:57,742 --> 01:07:00,452
As was I. Obviously.

874
01:07:00,532 --> 01:07:02,634
Who'd wish to see
something in such poor taste?

875
01:07:02,713 --> 01:07:05,518
Apparently London's appetite
for horror knows no bounds.

876
01:07:05,598 --> 01:07:08,107
Our Golem was quite correct about that.

877
01:07:08,187 --> 01:07:10,543
Oh, Bluey, please!

878
01:07:10,623 --> 01:07:15,227
Have mercy!
It's been days since I've eaten!

879
01:07:26,069 --> 01:07:29,726
Oh, you are a kind man, Bluey!

880
01:07:30,006 --> 01:07:33,639
I shall never have it said
you're not good to me.

881
01:07:34,112 --> 01:07:37,743
I thought I might expire
from starvation.

882
01:07:51,028 --> 01:07:53,444
What on earth are you doing, dear?

883
01:07:53,524 --> 01:07:56,521
- I'm taking my medical treatment.
- You're treatment?

884
01:07:56,601 --> 01:08:01,258
The doctor told me to take
a daily walk on an empty stomach.

885
01:08:07,441 --> 01:08:10,677
Brought the receipt,
as you requested in your telegram.

886
01:08:12,283 --> 01:08:16,141
As you will see,
I did not buy cufflinks.

887
01:08:16,522 --> 01:08:17,975
A ladies' hat.

888
01:08:18,055 --> 01:08:21,778
I often shopped for stagewear
at Gerrard's little shop.

889
01:08:21,858 --> 01:08:24,680
God rest him. I knew him well.

890
01:08:24,760 --> 01:08:27,584
Now, you mentioned needing
a sample of my hand.

891
01:08:27,663 --> 01:08:32,388
Well, I brought a pile of my old papers.
Please, take as many as you see fit.

892
01:08:32,468 --> 01:08:36,956
I'm afraid I'll need you to produce
a sample in my presence, Mr. Leno.

893
01:08:38,973 --> 01:08:42,679
Then you will permit me to pay you a visit
at Scotland Yard tomorrow afternoon?

894
01:08:42,759 --> 01:08:44,969
Only, I have supper arrangements.

895
01:08:46,099 --> 01:08:48,389
And I've still to be rid of all of this.

896
01:08:49,219 --> 01:08:51,273
If you'll... excuse me?

897
01:08:51,353 --> 01:08:55,061
Perhaps we could continue
to talk while you're...

898
01:08:55,691 --> 01:09:00,310
I've some questions I'd like
to ask you about John Cree.

899
01:09:01,330 --> 01:09:05,019
Then I shall try to answer them. Though
one should never speak ill of the dead.

900
01:09:05,099 --> 01:09:07,888
- You didn't care for the man?
- I was friendly with his wife.

901
01:09:07,968 --> 01:09:11,761
He made her unhappy.
You may extrapolate the rest.

902
01:09:11,841 --> 01:09:14,297
When did you last see him?

903
01:09:14,377 --> 01:09:19,336
First night of his play, "Misery Junction,"
which also happened to be the closing night.

904
01:09:19,416 --> 01:09:22,071
I know. Did you see him afterwards?

905
01:09:22,151 --> 01:09:25,817
Of course. This is my theater.

906
01:09:26,037 --> 01:09:29,064
I took over managing it
last year when...

907
01:09:30,392 --> 01:09:33,247
...Uncle joined the great
pantomime in the sky.

908
01:09:33,826 --> 01:09:36,209
The performance was here?

909
01:09:36,290 --> 01:09:40,361
For Lizzie's sake.
Whatever became of our friendship...

910
01:09:40,601 --> 01:09:42,475
...we'll always be family.

911
01:09:44,407 --> 01:09:47,563
- Is John Cree a suspect?
- I'm not at liberty to say.

912
01:09:47,643 --> 01:09:51,232
A posthumous suspect.
What will you do, dig him up for the trial?

913
01:09:51,312 --> 01:09:55,323
Do you know why Lizzie might be
reluctant to voice any suspicions?

914
01:09:56,484 --> 01:09:58,846
You think she's protecting him?

915
01:09:59,387 --> 01:10:01,742
Now, that's a novel slant.

916
01:10:01,822 --> 01:10:04,279
Most people believe she poisoned him.

917
01:10:05,609 --> 01:10:07,369
Do you?

918
01:10:10,529 --> 01:10:14,892
Either way, that man was
the author of his own demise.

919
01:10:15,303 --> 01:10:17,593
He practically destroyed her.

920
01:10:17,672 --> 01:10:21,543
Insisting she give up the stage... I mean,
he may as well have ended her life.

921
01:10:22,310 --> 01:10:25,765
Do you think he was capable
of ending a life?

922
01:10:26,146 --> 01:10:28,436
Literally, I mean.

923
01:10:29,415 --> 01:10:32,330
Who knows what any man is capable of?

924
01:10:33,453 --> 01:10:35,907
We all wear pantomime masks...

925
01:10:35,987 --> 01:10:37,885
...do we not?

926
01:10:39,990 --> 01:10:42,250
I'm sorry, I really must dress now.

927
01:10:42,330 --> 01:10:45,027
First, tell me about Little Victor.

928
01:10:47,499 --> 01:10:49,989
If the injustices of the past
interest you...

929
01:10:50,069 --> 01:10:53,443
...you'd do better to look into
the demise of Tommy Farr.

930
01:10:53,873 --> 01:10:55,001
Uncle?

931
01:10:56,441 --> 01:10:57,640
Uncle.

932
01:11:08,285 --> 01:11:11,707
They said the jury expects
to reach a verdict this afternoon.

933
01:11:11,787 --> 01:11:13,303
I know. Lizzie...

934
01:11:13,383 --> 01:11:16,155
It would seem the press
have reached theirs already.

935
01:11:19,030 --> 01:11:20,987
Lizzie, I spoke with Dan.

936
01:11:21,067 --> 01:11:24,134
He urged me to look into Uncle's death.

937
01:11:24,903 --> 01:11:28,447
If you wanted to know about Uncle,
you should simply have asked.

938
01:11:28,527 --> 01:11:31,161
Come into the parlor.

939
01:11:31,241 --> 01:11:33,865
As the spider said to the fly.

940
01:11:35,345 --> 01:11:38,068
Isn't that how it goes? The rhyme?

941
01:11:38,148 --> 01:11:40,039
It may be, Lizzie.

942
01:11:41,551 --> 01:11:44,377
It may be. Cucumber sandwich?

943
01:11:44,457 --> 01:11:46,945
- No, thanks.
- Oh, I forgot.

944
01:11:47,025 --> 01:11:50,123
You're not entirely partial
to cucumber, are you?

945
01:11:52,695 --> 01:11:54,752
What's this about, Uncle?

946
01:11:54,932 --> 01:11:56,638
Why'd you invite me?

947
01:11:57,468 --> 01:11:59,891
I want to show you something.

948
01:12:00,572 --> 01:12:02,512
Well, close your eyes.

949
01:12:05,073 --> 01:12:06,904
Good girl.

950
01:12:31,399 --> 01:12:33,437
It's just my fun, Lizzie.

951
01:12:34,554 --> 01:12:37,193
I like a good beating
every now and again.

952
01:12:38,073 --> 01:12:39,962
Doesn't everyone?

953
01:12:40,742 --> 01:12:42,297
I know her.

954
01:12:42,377 --> 01:12:45,604
That's the girl who assisted the Great
Bolini. She used to be sawn in half.

955
01:12:45,683 --> 01:12:49,329
That's her, ducks. What a performer.

956
01:12:50,987 --> 01:12:53,273
But it's a shame
she had to leave the company.

957
01:12:53,353 --> 01:12:56,646
- Why have you shown me this?
- Don't play the innocent with me.

958
01:12:56,725 --> 01:12:59,147
I am not playing. I am real.

959
01:12:59,227 --> 01:13:01,950
Well, I'd be grateful
if you could oblige me, Lizzie...

960
01:13:02,030 --> 01:13:05,410
...with a pose, a tableau.

961
01:13:05,490 --> 01:13:09,566
- Perhaps a little beating?
- I'd rather be destroyed first.

962
01:13:10,737 --> 01:13:14,073
- I'm prepared to forget
this visit took place. - As I said,

963
01:13:14,474 --> 01:13:16,492
it is a pity she had to go.

964
01:13:16,671 --> 01:13:18,780
She grew tired of performing.

965
01:13:20,382 --> 01:13:22,271
You would never be rid of me.

966
01:13:22,951 --> 01:13:27,139
- Dan would never allow it.
- Well, I find, as keeper of Bunce...

967
01:13:27,755 --> 01:13:30,045
...that I can do as I please.

968
01:13:31,225 --> 01:13:32,762
Now...

969
01:13:33,391 --> 01:13:35,275
...you keep my secret...

970
01:13:35,355 --> 01:13:38,040
- ...and I'll keep yours.
- I have no secrets.

971
01:13:40,332 --> 01:13:42,258
You shall in a moment.

972
01:13:54,316 --> 01:13:56,504
<i>He said I'm to return to him
next Sunday...</i>

973
01:13:57,683 --> 01:14:00,106
...and every Sunday hereafter.

974
01:14:00,186 --> 01:14:02,243
To do the same again?

975
01:14:02,793 --> 01:14:04,845
There's photographs.

976
01:14:05,825 --> 01:14:08,371
- John, I had to speak of it to somebody.
- This is monstrous, Lizzie!

977
01:14:08,451 --> 01:14:10,325
You can't tell a soul.

978
01:14:12,730 --> 01:14:15,188
I shall put a stop to this.

979
01:14:15,568 --> 01:14:17,463
But first...

980
01:14:18,440 --> 01:14:20,019
...I wish to do this.

981
01:14:21,410 --> 01:14:25,559
He's robbed you of your honor.
Let me restore it to you.

982
01:14:27,647 --> 01:14:31,737
Uncle died three days
after John confronted him.

983
01:14:31,818 --> 01:14:35,140
Uncle was not young. He had a weak
heart and a fondness for drink.

984
01:14:35,220 --> 01:14:37,097
That's not what Dan Leno thinks.

985
01:14:37,277 --> 01:14:41,747
He thinks that John blackmailed Uncle
into changing his will and then killed him.

986
01:14:42,027 --> 01:14:44,711
£500 and the camera.

987
01:14:46,146 --> 01:14:48,766
It would seem I gave
an excellent beating.

988
01:14:50,370 --> 01:14:53,410
You don't want to be saved, do you?

989
01:14:54,402 --> 01:14:56,386
Not by me.

990
01:14:56,466 --> 01:14:58,331
Not by any man.

991
01:14:59,411 --> 01:15:01,674
I don't deserve to be saved.

992
01:15:17,996 --> 01:15:19,518
John, I can't.

993
01:15:19,598 --> 01:15:22,020
What do you mean?
We're husband and wife now, Lizzie.

994
01:15:22,100 --> 01:15:25,508
- I know.
- Three years I've waited.

995
01:15:25,588 --> 01:15:28,894
Three years of courtship
and endless bloody engagement.

996
01:15:28,974 --> 01:15:32,331
It's hardly my fault that Panto
season extended 'til easter.

997
01:15:32,411 --> 01:15:35,232
Would you have had me spend
our wedding night playing Aladdin?

998
01:15:35,312 --> 01:15:37,568
It seems now that option
would've been scarcely different.

999
01:15:37,647 --> 01:15:40,871
- Please, John, just try to understand.
- No, you understand!

1000
01:15:41,750 --> 01:15:43,274
John, please, I don't like it.

1001
01:15:43,354 --> 01:15:45,542
I don't ask for gratitude
for all I've done for you.

1002
01:15:45,622 --> 01:15:49,857
All I ask is that you fulfill
your duties as a wife.

1003
01:16:03,313 --> 01:16:05,172
What are you doing here?

1004
01:16:07,611 --> 01:16:09,200
Hello.

1005
01:16:09,880 --> 01:16:11,867
- Hello.
- Hello.

1006
01:16:11,947 --> 01:16:15,731
I'll have a new contract drawn up
tomorrow, John John. But don't you worry.

1007
01:16:15,811 --> 01:16:18,673
- Lizzie!
- But don't you worry.

1008
01:16:19,056 --> 01:16:20,620
Lizzie.

1009
01:16:23,092 --> 01:16:24,648
Well, well.

1010
01:16:26,263 --> 01:16:29,587
If it isn't Mrs. John Cree.

1011
01:16:29,666 --> 01:16:33,523
Three months of married life and you're
missing the roar of the greasepaint already.

1012
01:16:33,603 --> 01:16:37,626
Oh, nonsense.
I've been too busy to miss anything.

1013
01:16:37,705 --> 01:16:42,482
What tosh! Little Lizzie
without an audience.

1014
01:16:42,944 --> 01:16:45,800
You mustn't let that rotten man
order you about so.

1015
01:16:45,880 --> 01:16:48,269
John is perfectly happy for me
to perform.

1016
01:16:48,349 --> 01:16:50,474
Still going to play the lead
in "Misery Junction."

1017
01:16:50,554 --> 01:16:52,065
Come of it, Lizzie.

1018
01:16:52,145 --> 01:16:55,986
That man's so petrified of failure
he'll never bring himself to finish it.

1019
01:16:56,066 --> 01:16:59,882
He's writing every day at the library.
It's almost complete.

1020
01:16:59,962 --> 01:17:02,384
I'm telling you as a friend, Lizzie.

1021
01:17:02,464 --> 01:17:05,688
Forget "Misery Junction." Forget John.

1022
01:17:05,968 --> 01:17:07,859
If you want your name etched in stone...

1023
01:17:07,939 --> 01:17:11,560
...you're gonna have to take up
the chisel yourself.

1024
01:17:12,440 --> 01:17:14,529
So, to what do we owe the pleasure?

1025
01:17:14,609 --> 01:17:16,882
I'm actually here to see Aveline.

1026
01:17:19,478 --> 01:17:21,971
I have a proposition for you, dear.

1027
01:17:22,051 --> 01:17:24,143
I'm in need of a ladies' maid.

1028
01:17:24,553 --> 01:17:26,055
Me?

1029
01:17:27,256 --> 01:17:28,608
You must be playing.

1030
01:17:28,687 --> 01:17:31,547
I can offer you twice the weekly
wage you're earning here.

1031
01:17:31,627 --> 01:17:35,116
What I require is some help
bearing the load of my...

1032
01:17:35,196 --> 01:17:37,017
...my wifely duties.

1033
01:17:37,098 --> 01:17:38,959
Dear God, Lizzie.

1034
01:18:01,720 --> 01:18:03,897
Do you know how John's play
is coming along?

1035
01:18:03,977 --> 01:18:06,014
Very nicely, he tells me.

1036
01:18:06,794 --> 01:18:11,151
You know, there's no need for you
to prepare his nightly cordial, Lizzie.

1037
01:18:11,231 --> 01:18:13,085
I can do it.

1038
01:18:13,165 --> 01:18:16,188
I make one for myself.
It's no more effort to prepare two.

1039
01:18:16,268 --> 01:18:18,424
I'd be happy to make both.

1040
01:18:18,504 --> 01:18:23,186
I could bring yours to your quarters
before I take John's to his.

1041
01:20:09,345 --> 01:20:11,462
- What on earth are you doing here?
- I should ask you the same thing...

1042
01:20:11,542 --> 01:20:14,170
...because I know what it is
you're not doing, and that is writing.

1043
01:20:14,250 --> 01:20:16,872
Why tell me "Misery Junction" was not
finished when it was hardly even begun?

1044
01:20:16,953 --> 01:20:21,006
It was! It's nearly complete.
I've just put it aside for now.

1045
01:20:21,086 --> 01:20:25,550
Put it aside? I support you financially.
I allow that your every need is met!

1046
01:20:25,630 --> 01:20:30,555
Don't pillory me about my damn play
if what really irks you is Aveline.

1047
01:20:30,635 --> 01:20:32,724
Why would that irk me?

1048
01:20:34,154 --> 01:20:37,561
Go home, Lizzie.
Let me finish my research.

1049
01:20:37,640 --> 01:20:40,929
Your research? Into what?

1050
01:20:41,009 --> 01:20:43,867
My play. My new play.

1051
01:20:45,147 --> 01:20:47,235
But what of "Misery Junction"?

1052
01:20:47,315 --> 01:20:50,005
I grew tired of Katherine Dove.

1053
01:20:50,345 --> 01:20:52,307
Is there a role in it for me?

1054
01:20:52,387 --> 01:20:55,112
No, Lizzie. There is not.

1055
01:20:55,192 --> 01:20:57,280
You're a lady now...

1056
01:20:57,360 --> 01:20:59,858
...and the stage is no place for a lady.

1057
01:21:07,712 --> 01:21:11,256
You staged it without permission
and it was poorly received.

1058
01:21:11,336 --> 01:21:14,762
"'Misery Junction' leaves
audience in misery, indeed."

1059
01:21:15,143 --> 01:21:18,944
Isn't it funny how the savage reviews are
the ones you can recall word for word?

1060
01:21:24,349 --> 01:21:27,300
- More! More!
- Uncle, please.

1061
01:21:27,380 --> 01:21:30,173
You have stolen my honor! I am innocent!

1062
01:21:30,253 --> 01:21:32,981
You wish to be a man?
Just pretend that I'm a women!

1063
01:21:33,061 --> 01:21:36,218
It's Lizzie they're mocking, John.
It's not your play.

1064
01:21:36,298 --> 01:21:39,554
You lie! This was not for me!
This was for you!

1065
01:21:39,634 --> 01:21:42,275
You wish to prove yourself
as an actress, you selfish whore...

1066
01:21:42,355 --> 01:21:45,149
- ...and you failed even at that!
- You are the failure.

1067
01:21:45,506 --> 01:21:47,460
- Jesus!
- See?

1068
01:21:47,540 --> 01:21:50,364
Where's the White Knight now, John?
You are just as all men.

1069
01:21:50,444 --> 01:21:54,059
One more word from your mouth
and I will snap your wretched neck!

1070
01:21:54,139 --> 01:21:55,401
John, go home.

1071
01:21:55,484 --> 01:21:58,180
My play was unfinished
and you destroyed it!

1072
01:21:58,260 --> 01:22:00,844
Destroyed me and my reputation!

1073
01:22:00,924 --> 01:22:03,744
You don't have a reputation!
Who do you believe yourself to be?

1074
01:22:03,824 --> 01:22:07,281
You are nobody, John, nobody,
and you never will be!

1075
01:22:07,361 --> 01:22:10,184
Get out of here, John. Out!

1076
01:22:11,764 --> 01:22:14,488
Look at you both. You're clowns.

1077
01:22:14,568 --> 01:22:16,436
Worthless clowns.

1078
01:22:16,516 --> 01:22:19,658
You're the ones
who'll be forgotten, not me.

1079
01:22:19,738 --> 01:22:21,182
Not me.

1080
01:22:27,114 --> 01:22:28,569
- John?
- Drive on.

1081
01:22:28,648 --> 01:22:30,337
- John.
- Giddyup!

1082
01:22:30,417 --> 01:22:31,839
John.

1083
01:22:31,919 --> 01:22:33,441
John.

1084
01:22:34,321 --> 01:22:35,356
John!

1085
01:22:35,436 --> 01:22:38,457
That opening night, September the 5th,
it drove him over the edge...

1086
01:22:38,537 --> 01:22:42,641
...but not to suicide. It drove him to
prove to the world that he was an artist.

1087
01:22:42,721 --> 01:22:46,884
That night, the Golem made his first kill,
and you think it's your fault.

1088
01:22:46,964 --> 01:22:49,720
- You're putting words in my mouth.
- Why this dance, Lizzie?

1089
01:22:49,800 --> 01:22:53,654
Why won't you admit that you came to know
or at least suspect what he'd become?

1090
01:22:53,734 --> 01:22:58,167
- If this is a dance, it is you who is leading.
- Let me read you the last entry.

1091
01:22:59,446 --> 01:23:01,868
"Ratcliffe Highway was a tour de force.

1092
01:23:01,948 --> 01:23:05,258
And as an actor may take home
a program as a souvenir...

1093
01:23:05,338 --> 01:23:09,907
...so I returned with a blood-soaked shawl
belonging to the clothes seller's wife.

1094
01:23:09,987 --> 01:23:13,922
The next night, fearful of discovery,
I ventured to destroy it...

1095
01:23:14,002 --> 01:23:16,484
<i>...and therein lay my mistake.</i>

1096
01:23:20,729 --> 01:23:23,720
John, you're home.
I didn't hear you come in.

1097
01:23:31,675 --> 01:23:35,823
There were no questions asked,
no recriminations.

1098
01:23:44,853 --> 01:23:48,320
<i>I believe a homemade punishment
may be planned for me instead.</i>

1099
01:24:11,179 --> 01:24:13,834
<i>I no longer feel safe under my own roof.</i>

1100
01:24:16,318 --> 01:24:18,402
<i>I cannot go on like this.</i>

1101
01:24:21,890 --> 01:24:23,917
You poisoned him, didn't you?

1102
01:24:27,295 --> 01:24:29,620
Lizzie, listen to me.
We have a few minutes.

1103
01:24:29,699 --> 01:24:32,959
You can still change your plea. Confess.
You did it because you knew what he was.

1104
01:24:33,039 --> 01:24:35,213
You did it because
you were in fear for your life.

1105
01:24:35,293 --> 01:24:37,234
I promise you'll have
the sympathy of the jury.

1106
01:24:37,315 --> 01:24:40,729
- I don't want their sympathy.
- Why do you not deserve redemption?

1107
01:24:40,809 --> 01:24:43,433
Because you killed him or because
you believe you created a monster?

1108
01:24:43,513 --> 01:24:45,298
What I deserve is to live freely...

1109
01:24:45,378 --> 01:24:48,094
...and in death be remembered for
my accomplishments, not as the wife...

1110
01:24:48,174 --> 01:24:51,439
...who poisoned her husband,
my name forever tethered to his.

1111
01:24:52,119 --> 01:24:53,948
Mrs. Cree.

1112
01:24:54,889 --> 01:24:58,111
While that chance remains,
I have no choice but to cling to it.

1113
01:25:05,066 --> 01:25:07,002
<i>Have the jury reached a verdict?</i>

1114
01:25:07,802 --> 01:25:11,756
- Yes, My Lord.
- How do the jury find the defendant?

1115
01:25:11,836 --> 01:25:13,461
Guilty.

1116
01:25:14,041 --> 01:25:17,283
Order! Order!

1117
01:25:17,513 --> 01:25:19,381
Elizabeth Cree...

1118
01:25:19,461 --> 01:25:24,451
...you will be returned to prison and taken
from there to a place of execution...

1119
01:25:24,532 --> 01:25:27,890
<i>...where at 10:00 tomorrow morning,
you will be hanged by the neck...</i>

1120
01:25:27,970 --> 01:25:29,778
<i>...until you are dead.</i>

1121
01:25:29,858 --> 01:25:32,581
<i>May the Lord have mercy on your soul.</i>

1122
01:25:32,660 --> 01:25:36,293
Inspector Kildare, Scotland Yard.
I need a moment with her, please.

1123
01:25:40,070 --> 01:25:42,790
- You don't deserve this.
- It's done. I hang tomorrow at 10:00.

1124
01:25:42,870 --> 01:25:45,892
No. I won't let it happen.
John Cree was a murderer.

1125
01:25:45,972 --> 01:25:50,473
I mean to prove it and appeal for your
pardon. The world needs to know the truth.

1126
01:25:56,382 --> 01:25:58,438
I'd like for you to unmask the Golem.

1127
01:25:58,518 --> 01:26:01,560
This is your moment, your chance.
I'd like for you to have that.

1128
01:26:01,639 --> 01:26:03,919
I'm sorry, sir. We need to leave.

1129
01:26:06,092 --> 01:26:07,648
We don't have much time.

1130
01:26:07,728 --> 01:26:10,924
The manuscript of "Misery Junction"
is handwritten. Dan may still have it.

1131
01:26:11,004 --> 01:26:14,095
I shall stop this. I promise you.

1132
01:26:18,704 --> 01:26:20,730
You filthy...

1133
01:26:36,289 --> 01:26:38,508
Here we are again!

1134
01:26:40,658 --> 01:26:42,949
Lizzie paid for the hire of the theater.

1135
01:26:43,029 --> 01:26:46,319
I advised her against it,
but she was adamant.

1136
01:26:46,399 --> 01:26:48,596
And it was not a success.

1137
01:26:49,634 --> 01:26:51,856
That's putting it mildly.

1138
01:26:51,936 --> 01:26:54,124
So put it any way that you will.

1139
01:26:54,205 --> 01:26:58,530
Barely any tickets sold,
but Lizzie insisted on a full house...

1140
01:26:58,610 --> 01:27:02,017
...so she took to the streets
and gave them away to the poor.

1141
01:27:12,288 --> 01:27:15,122
Here it is. "Misery Junction."

1142
01:27:19,664 --> 01:27:21,919
It's typeset.

1143
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:24,992
Oh, I don't have the original
manuscript, I'm afraid.

1144
01:27:25,072 --> 01:27:28,923
A usual practice is to have it archived,
unless the author asks for it back...

1145
01:27:29,003 --> 01:27:31,848
- ...which he didn't.
- Archived... where?

1146
01:27:32,311 --> 01:27:35,066
The librarian agreed
to open up early, sir.

1147
01:27:35,146 --> 01:27:36,968
He should be here any moment.

1148
01:27:37,048 --> 01:27:40,519
I pray he is. They hang her at 10:00.

1149
01:27:58,535 --> 01:28:00,106
<i>Lizzie!</i>

1150
01:28:05,977 --> 01:28:07,840
<i>Lizzie!</i>

1151
01:28:14,184 --> 01:28:15,771
Lizzie.

1152
01:28:15,851 --> 01:28:17,728
I'm ready.

1153
01:28:30,664 --> 01:28:33,253
But this is most odd. Should be here.

1154
01:28:33,333 --> 01:28:35,392
Could someone have withdrawn it?

1155
01:28:35,472 --> 01:28:37,760
Not unless they did so just now.

1156
01:28:38,351 --> 01:28:41,103
- Quickly, the door.
- Sir!

1157
01:28:46,614 --> 01:28:48,237
Unhand me! I've done nothing wrong.

1158
01:28:48,317 --> 01:28:51,162
Then perhaps you can tell us
why the hurry to obtain this?

1159
01:28:51,242 --> 01:28:54,549
I plan to rewrite it, sir.
Demand a production.

1160
01:28:54,628 --> 01:28:59,514
A topical shocker about Lizzie Cree.
Now she's to be hanged, it'll be a smash.

1161
01:28:59,594 --> 01:29:01,982
Really? So you're a writer now,
are you, Miss Ortega?

1162
01:29:02,062 --> 01:29:05,489
No, sir. But it won't require much work.

1163
01:29:05,569 --> 01:29:07,657
It was the story of her life, after all.

1164
01:29:07,737 --> 01:29:10,993
My idea is to begin the play
at the Gallows...

1165
01:29:11,073 --> 01:29:13,161
...then retrace each step
that led her to them.

1166
01:29:13,241 --> 01:29:17,369
I cannot help but think that the addition
of a murderous husband might be popular.

1167
01:29:17,449 --> 01:29:19,743
I told you all I know, sir.

1168
01:29:20,615 --> 01:29:22,363
John is innocent.

1169
01:29:58,065 --> 01:30:01,374
- Jesus!
- You're the ones who'll be forgotten!

1170
01:30:01,454 --> 01:30:03,264
Not me.

1171
01:30:09,530 --> 01:30:11,552
Is it time?

1172
01:30:11,631 --> 01:30:13,053
There's no one here.

1173
01:30:13,133 --> 01:30:17,717
They hardly ever admit the public these
days, Mrs. Cree. Only for the most hated.

1174
01:30:17,797 --> 01:30:21,589
Please, no. You must help me.
Please. Please tell them to wait.

1175
01:30:21,668 --> 01:30:24,027
- Inspector Kildare is coming.
- I'm sorry.

1176
01:30:24,377 --> 01:30:26,400
Can't you go any faster?

1177
01:30:26,480 --> 01:30:28,767
- Prison's just around the corner.
- I know!

1178
01:30:28,847 --> 01:30:31,840
No, we must wait for him, please.
This is wrong! He will prove it!

1179
01:30:31,920 --> 01:30:35,200
- I beg you, just a little longer!
- I'm sorry.

1180
01:30:40,058 --> 01:30:41,626
Come on!

1181
01:31:06,432 --> 01:31:08,282
Coming through.

1182
01:31:13,790 --> 01:31:17,316
- Steady, sir. Who are you here for?
- Elizabeth Cree. Say I'm not too late.

1183
01:31:17,396 --> 01:31:19,839
They're just taking her down.
Quick as you can.

1184
01:31:20,798 --> 01:31:22,665
Send for the magistrate!

1185
01:31:26,704 --> 01:31:29,055
Stop! Stop!

1186
01:31:39,246 --> 01:31:43,095
Don't thank me yet. All they've given me is
an hour's grace to speak to the magistrate.

1187
01:31:43,175 --> 01:31:45,377
I've still to convince him
to reduce your sentence.

1188
01:31:45,457 --> 01:31:48,713
Don't be glum. You have the Golem.

1189
01:31:48,793 --> 01:31:52,246
The world will know
the real story, and it's you...

1190
01:31:52,326 --> 01:31:56,413
...you who will know
every chapter, who will tell it.

1191
01:31:56,832 --> 01:31:59,859
- You have my gratitude. Always.
- And you mine.

1192
01:32:06,874 --> 01:32:09,410
Lizzie, Lizzie, don't.

1193
01:32:13,883 --> 01:32:16,239
Could any believe John Cree
capable of such deeds?

1194
01:32:16,320 --> 01:32:18,308
I guarantee it.

1195
01:32:18,388 --> 01:32:20,418
Have no doubt.

1196
01:32:22,824 --> 01:32:24,890
Then let us bring this to an end.

1197
01:32:31,065 --> 01:32:33,456
Here's what you will write.

1198
01:32:33,536 --> 01:32:37,758
"I am Elizabeth Cree,
and in September of this year...

1199
01:32:37,838 --> 01:32:40,459
...I came to know that my husband...

1200
01:32:40,540 --> 01:32:42,263
...was the Limehouse Golem."

1201
01:32:42,512 --> 01:32:44,943
All you need to do is tell the truth.

1202
01:32:47,349 --> 01:32:50,390
I have never told you anything
but the truth, Kildare.

1203
01:33:31,842 --> 01:33:34,089
You shall have your moment, and I mine.

1204
01:33:37,836 --> 01:33:42,078
In the temple of fame, our names will be
written side-by-side in stone for all time.

1205
01:33:51,378 --> 01:33:53,468
Who was here on September the 24th?

1206
01:33:53,548 --> 01:33:55,902
There were four men
in the reading room that day...

1207
01:33:55,982 --> 01:33:59,814
...but there's no earthly way of knowing
what anyone read or when they read it.

1208
01:34:04,222 --> 01:34:07,658
John. You're home.
I didn't hear you come in.

1209
01:34:11,264 --> 01:34:15,290
<i>There were no questions asked,
no recriminations.</i>

1210
01:34:15,869 --> 01:34:18,921
<i>I believe a homemade punishment
may be planned for me instead.</i>

1211
01:34:21,206 --> 01:34:23,375
<i>I no longer feel safe under my own roof.</i>

1212
01:34:23,975 --> 01:34:26,008
<i>I cannot go on like this.</i>

1213
01:34:28,947 --> 01:34:31,507
<i>Still, we had agreement
to keep each other's secrets.</i>

1214
01:34:31,587 --> 01:34:35,293
<i>And you didn't keep mine, did you?
I wonder what I should do with yours.</i>

1215
01:34:35,373 --> 01:34:37,616
I think you should take it to the grave.

1216
01:35:13,993 --> 01:35:15,723
Mr. Gerrard, sir?

1217
01:35:32,009 --> 01:35:33,539
Annie?

1218
01:35:51,761 --> 01:35:56,472
I know, I know. Few would think
a woman capable of such artistry.

1219
01:36:18,220 --> 01:36:20,308
Here we are again!

1220
01:37:06,565 --> 01:37:08,397
You were too late?

1221
01:37:10,936 --> 01:37:14,564
This... this is probably the last thing
you want at present...

1222
01:37:14,643 --> 01:37:16,728
but they're waiting
for you downstairs.

1223
01:37:18,514 --> 01:37:21,011
You're about to be
the toast of London, John.

1224
01:37:27,820 --> 01:37:30,311
I know how much you cared for her.

1225
01:37:30,391 --> 01:37:31,946
Just...

1226
01:37:32,826 --> 01:37:35,240
...know how grateful she would be
that the world will know...

1227
01:37:35,320 --> 01:37:38,284
...what her bastard husband really was.

1228
01:37:38,364 --> 01:37:43,191
Not just as a murderer, but as a man who
sought to deny her all she wanted to be.

1229
01:37:43,272 --> 01:37:45,752
It's you who saved her honor.

1230
01:37:47,940 --> 01:37:49,773
Her memory.

1231
01:37:52,012 --> 01:37:54,478
She would've wanted you to have this.

1232
01:38:12,263 --> 01:38:15,111
No! We must wait for him. Please!
This is wrong, he will prove it!

1233
01:38:15,194 --> 01:38:18,236
- I beg you, just a little longer!
- I...

1234
01:38:19,273 --> 01:38:23,828
I don't believe Inspector Kildare
will be coming back.

1235
01:38:29,487 --> 01:38:32,228
- I am not a poisoner.
- I believe you.

1236
01:38:32,308 --> 01:38:34,207
I am so much more.

1237
01:38:34,287 --> 01:38:39,693
We shall be issuing our full report
on John Cree in an hour, gentlemen.

1238
01:38:39,773 --> 01:38:42,647
Well, it seems the show must go on.

1239
01:38:43,626 --> 01:38:47,454
Londoners can sleep easy
in their beds again.

1240
01:38:47,534 --> 01:38:49,388
The Golem is no more.

1241
01:38:49,468 --> 01:38:53,138
Inspector! Inspector,
any comments on your promotion, sir?

1242
01:38:55,894 --> 01:38:59,006
- Any last words?
- Here we are again!

1243
01:40:22,821 --> 01:40:24,627
Let us begin...

1244
01:40:24,707 --> 01:40:26,557
...my friends...

1245
01:40:27,196 --> 01:40:29,039
...at the end.

1246
01:41:22,683 --> 01:41:27,288
Not the green, love, the red.
Mother doesn't get sick until scene four.

1247
01:41:34,877 --> 01:41:36,725
Did anyone check the safety?

1248
01:41:48,072 --> 01:41:50,306
Take her weight. Take...

1249
01:41:54,480 --> 01:41:56,337
What's going on?

1250
01:41:57,217 --> 01:41:58,814
Is she breathing?

1251
01:42:04,556 --> 01:42:06,762
We have to get back out there.

1252
01:42:08,706 --> 01:42:10,731
You're Lizzie's mother now.

1253
01:42:25,177 --> 01:42:26,627
I'll be Lizzie.

1254
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:07,544
Lizzie!
