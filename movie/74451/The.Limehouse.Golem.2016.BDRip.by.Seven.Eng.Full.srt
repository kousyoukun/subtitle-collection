1
00:00:54,480 --> 00:01:00,904
Let us begin, my friends,
at the end.

2
00:01:21,007 --> 00:01:23,218
John?

3
00:01:23,343 --> 00:01:25,053
John!

4
00:01:56,876 --> 00:01:59,587
He left nothing?

5
00:01:59,712 --> 00:02:01,297
No... note?

6
00:02:01,422 --> 00:02:02,632
If he meant to poison himself,

7
00:02:02,757 --> 00:02:04,592
why would he not
at least leave a note?

8
00:02:04,717 --> 00:02:06,761
I fear that the act of
burning his papers

9
00:02:06,886 --> 00:02:09,055
bears testament enough
to his state of mind.

10
00:02:10,723 --> 00:02:12,100
Mrs. Cree...? Forgive me...

11
00:02:12,225 --> 00:02:14,769
I-I know this is neither
the time nor the place...

12
00:02:14,894 --> 00:02:19,440
but may I say what an ardent
admirer I am of your work?

13
00:02:19,565 --> 00:02:22,110
I looked in the kitchen, sir.

14
00:02:22,235 --> 00:02:24,946
This was all I could find.

15
00:02:25,071 --> 00:02:28,449
I'm afraid this'll be it.

16
00:02:28,574 --> 00:02:30,493
There was residue in a glass
on the nightstand.

17
00:02:30,618 --> 00:02:32,453
Oh, it can't have been
in there, sir.

18
00:02:32,578 --> 00:02:35,290
His nightly cordial was always
prepared by Mrs. Cree.

19
00:02:35,415 --> 00:02:37,166
Aveline...?

20
00:02:37,292 --> 00:02:41,671
You... did not make the drink?

21
00:02:41,796 --> 00:02:44,465
Surely you're not
asking me in earnest

22
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:46,676
if I poisoned my husband?

23
00:02:46,801 --> 00:02:49,470
Oh, sir, believe me,
she cannot have done this!

24
00:02:49,595 --> 00:02:52,015
The two of them were in a most
violent dispute yesterday!

25
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:53,975
Why would she prepare
Mr. Cree a nightcap

26
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:55,411
when they were not
on speaking terms?

27
00:02:55,435 --> 00:02:57,812
Aveline, what has possessed you?

28
00:02:57,937 --> 00:03:01,316
Sir, please,
allow me to explain.

29
00:03:01,441 --> 00:03:02,984
I'm sorry, Mrs. Cree.

30
00:03:03,109 --> 00:03:05,653
You'll need to do that
down at Scotland Yard.

31
00:03:11,784 --> 00:03:17,373
A woman accused of
poisoning her husband.

32
00:03:17,498 --> 00:03:20,293
But not just any woman...

33
00:03:22,128 --> 00:03:24,172
Little Lizzie,

34
00:03:24,297 --> 00:03:29,510
darling of the music halls.

35
00:03:29,635 --> 00:03:32,055
But the city was in thrall

36
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:37,852
with the fearsome
Limehouse Golem.

37
00:03:37,977 --> 00:03:39,687
Who was he?

38
00:03:39,812 --> 00:03:42,690
Who would be his next victim?

39
00:03:42,815 --> 00:03:46,527
The Golem had last struck

40
00:03:46,652 --> 00:03:50,406
the day before her arrest.

41
00:03:50,531 --> 00:03:53,201
And his was the name

42
00:03:53,326 --> 00:03:56,371
on every Londoner's lips.

43
00:04:15,348 --> 00:04:17,266
How many are dead?

44
00:04:17,392 --> 00:04:19,894
Five.

45
00:04:20,019 --> 00:04:24,774
Shopkeeper Mr. Gerrard,
his wife Mary, their maid...

46
00:04:24,899 --> 00:04:27,735
and the two Gerrard children.

47
00:04:29,695 --> 00:04:31,781
It's not... number 29.

48
00:04:31,906 --> 00:04:33,574
29 Ratcliffe Highway?

49
00:04:33,699 --> 00:04:34,575
What of it?

50
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:36,244
The Ratcliffe Highway murders?

51
00:04:36,369 --> 00:04:37,912
John Williams?

52
00:04:38,037 --> 00:04:39,747
It's a bit before my time.

53
00:04:39,872 --> 00:04:42,250
And mine!
It was 70 years ago!

54
00:04:44,085 --> 00:04:45,920
Inspector Roberts!

55
00:04:46,045 --> 00:04:47,898
Can you confirm that
this is the work of the Golem?

56
00:04:47,922 --> 00:04:49,233
What is it about this house?

57
00:04:49,257 --> 00:04:50,758
Do you think it could be cursed,
sir?

58
00:04:50,883 --> 00:04:53,594
Gentlemen, gentlemen, please!

59
00:04:53,719 --> 00:04:58,266
I'd ask you to, uh, direct
your requests to my colleague,

60
00:04:58,391 --> 00:05:02,270
Detective Inspector Kildare.
He's taking over the case.

61
00:05:02,395 --> 00:05:04,206
Kildare?
How are you spelling that?

62
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:05,648
Taking over?

63
00:05:05,773 --> 00:05:09,318
I'm just stepping aside,
not stepping down.

64
00:05:11,404 --> 00:05:14,782
The public seeks reassurance,
Kildare.

65
00:05:14,907 --> 00:05:17,577
What better way than to
give them new blood?

66
00:05:18,578 --> 00:05:20,889
Are you fearful of stepping into the
shoes of the great Mr. Roberts?

67
00:05:20,913 --> 00:05:22,891
Can you confirm
this is the work of the Golem?

68
00:05:22,915 --> 00:05:25,460
How many more people have to die
before the Golem is caught?

69
00:05:25,585 --> 00:05:26,794
Driver!

70
00:05:28,754 --> 00:05:31,966
Detective Roberts!

71
00:05:32,091 --> 00:05:33,968
Inspector Kildare, is it true

72
00:05:34,093 --> 00:05:35,511
that this is
your first murder case?

73
00:05:35,636 --> 00:05:37,305
Inspector Kildare!

74
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:38,639
Kildare!

75
00:05:38,764 --> 00:05:40,183
Move. Move back.

76
00:05:40,308 --> 00:05:41,476
Do you know if they'll be

77
00:05:41,601 --> 00:05:42,786
displaying the bodies today,
sir?

78
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:43,811
Step aside, sir.

79
00:05:43,936 --> 00:05:45,521
The maid was found over there.

80
00:05:45,646 --> 00:05:47,916
Were there footprints when you
arrived? The Golem's prints?

81
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:49,460
Half of Limehouse
was already here.

82
00:05:49,484 --> 00:05:50,924
Which of the victims
was found there?

83
00:05:50,985 --> 00:05:52,862
None. The Golem moved
that one himself.

84
00:05:52,987 --> 00:05:54,989
- Either Mr. or Mrs. Gerrard.
- More likely him.

85
00:05:55,114 --> 00:05:56,133
If the maid was killed first,

86
00:05:56,157 --> 00:05:57,658
he'd investigate
the disturbance.

87
00:05:57,783 --> 00:05:59,761
- Where is her body now?
- We took her upstairs, sir.

88
00:05:59,785 --> 00:06:01,829
At least up there we can
keep the Hoi poloi out.

89
00:06:01,954 --> 00:06:04,141
- Down here is a lost cause.
- They can't all be reporters.

90
00:06:04,165 --> 00:06:06,834
Oh, no. Locals looking
for entertainment.

91
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:08,336
Cheaper than a ticket
to a shocker.

92
00:06:08,461 --> 00:06:11,005
Sometimes I suspect if
I was dispatched to hell,

93
00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:13,841
I'd barely notice the change,
bar the weather.

94
00:06:13,966 --> 00:06:15,176
This is Inspector Kildare.

95
00:06:15,301 --> 00:06:17,845
- Taking over from Roberts.
- Sir.

96
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:20,848
Can you tell this idiot
to let me up?

97
00:06:20,973 --> 00:06:23,017
I'm with the Evening Post!

98
00:06:32,985 --> 00:06:35,363
This is the maid?

99
00:06:43,704 --> 00:06:45,873
I'm sorry.

100
00:06:45,998 --> 00:06:48,000
I've never seen anything
of this kind.

101
00:06:49,877 --> 00:06:51,212
Neither have I.

102
00:07:34,255 --> 00:07:38,259
"He who observes
spills no less blood

103
00:07:38,384 --> 00:07:40,803
than he who inflicts the blow."

104
00:07:40,928 --> 00:07:42,763
Lactantius.

105
00:07:42,888 --> 00:07:45,641
Impressive, sir.

106
00:07:45,766 --> 00:07:48,477
The truth has a habit
of sticking in the mind.

107
00:07:48,603 --> 00:07:52,481
Truth?

108
00:07:52,607 --> 00:07:54,609
Those who fail
to prevent injustice

109
00:07:54,734 --> 00:07:58,279
are as guilty
as the perpetrator.

110
00:07:58,404 --> 00:08:00,781
It's a message...

111
00:08:00,906 --> 00:08:02,783
to us.

112
00:08:09,123 --> 00:08:12,335
Evidence... John Cree case.

113
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:14,295
The poisoning.

114
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:15,504
You've had quite a week.

115
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:17,089
First the Limehouse Golem,
now this.

116
00:08:22,261 --> 00:08:24,805
I heard Inspector Kildare
was asking after you.

117
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:26,349
Yes.

118
00:08:26,474 --> 00:08:28,809
I don't know what he wanted.
I keep missing him.

119
00:08:28,934 --> 00:08:32,313
Well, they did right giving him
the Golem case, I reckon.

120
00:08:32,438 --> 00:08:34,815
He'd have risen well
above Roberts by now

121
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:37,652
if those rumors
hadn't done for him.

122
00:08:37,777 --> 00:08:39,153
You know.

123
00:08:39,278 --> 00:08:40,946
That he wasn't
the marrying kind...

124
00:08:44,116 --> 00:08:45,284
Men.

125
00:08:46,452 --> 00:08:50,122
Oh, it's before your time,
I suppose.

126
00:08:58,464 --> 00:09:00,007
Come in.

127
00:09:01,967 --> 00:09:03,511
I got your message, sir.

128
00:09:03,636 --> 00:09:06,180
I'm being assigned a constable.

129
00:09:06,305 --> 00:09:08,158
I thought someone of
your knowledge of Limehouse

130
00:09:08,182 --> 00:09:09,350
might be an asset.

131
00:09:09,475 --> 00:09:10,685
When I heard nothing back,

132
00:09:10,810 --> 00:09:12,120
I thought perhaps
the offer didn't appeal.

133
00:09:12,144 --> 00:09:14,855
I came by twice, sir.
You were out.

134
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:17,858
I was at Limehouse.
Appealing for witnesses.

135
00:09:17,983 --> 00:09:19,694
To no avail.

136
00:09:25,157 --> 00:09:27,201
- What are you looking for?
- I'm just looking.

137
00:09:27,326 --> 00:09:28,869
Trying to understand.

138
00:09:28,994 --> 00:09:30,705
The Golem's a madman.

139
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:31,848
What else is there
to be understood?

140
00:09:31,872 --> 00:09:33,874
Even madness has its own logic.

141
00:09:33,999 --> 00:09:35,418
Here there's none.

142
00:09:35,543 --> 00:09:37,878
At Ratcliffe Highway,
he slaughtered a household.

143
00:09:38,003 --> 00:09:40,381
The previous week,
a prostitute. Alice Stanton.

144
00:09:40,506 --> 00:09:41,882
Before that, Solomon Weil.

145
00:09:42,007 --> 00:09:44,844
He was an old man,
a... a scholar.

146
00:09:47,555 --> 00:09:49,390
Oh, my God.

147
00:09:49,515 --> 00:09:52,059
- Is that his...
- Yes.

148
00:09:52,184 --> 00:09:55,438
Laid upon the open pages
of a book on Jewish folklore,

149
00:09:55,563 --> 00:09:56,897
like a bookmark.

150
00:09:58,691 --> 00:10:01,235
"The Legend of the Golem."

151
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,671
Is that how the press
got the name?

152
00:10:02,695 --> 00:10:04,572
Our murderer obviously approved.

153
00:10:04,697 --> 00:10:05,906
And who were the first two?

154
00:10:06,031 --> 00:10:07,241
Both women of the streets.

155
00:10:07,366 --> 00:10:09,243
I do remember reading
of that one.

156
00:10:09,368 --> 00:10:14,081
- "Old Salty."
- Her name was Jane Quig.

157
00:10:14,206 --> 00:10:16,751
The point is there's no story
to any of them.

158
00:10:16,876 --> 00:10:20,129
Men, women, young, old. Jew
and Christian. Rich and poor.

159
00:10:20,254 --> 00:10:21,464
Perhaps he just likes to kill.

160
00:10:21,589 --> 00:10:23,591
No.

161
00:10:23,716 --> 00:10:26,427
I'll wager there's
a tale being told.

162
00:10:26,552 --> 00:10:31,599
If we can sink to his circle
of damnation to comprehend it.

163
00:10:31,724 --> 00:10:33,601
If I may say, sir,

164
00:10:33,726 --> 00:10:35,579
seems you've been wasted
down in theft-and-fraud.

165
00:10:35,603 --> 00:10:37,271
Oh, I'll be back there
soon enough,

166
00:10:37,396 --> 00:10:39,374
if the Golem strikes again.
That seems to be the plan.

167
00:10:39,398 --> 00:10:40,649
What do you mean?

168
00:10:40,775 --> 00:10:43,110
The Yard is setting me up
as a scapegoat.

169
00:10:43,235 --> 00:10:44,945
They'll not risk Roberts,
will they?

170
00:10:45,070 --> 00:10:46,614
I'm expendable.

171
00:10:46,739 --> 00:10:49,158
They get to preserve the
reputation of their golden boy

172
00:10:49,283 --> 00:10:52,495
and the public...

173
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:53,829
get blood.

174
00:10:53,954 --> 00:10:55,790
Well, as I said
back in Limehouse...

175
00:10:55,915 --> 00:10:58,125
seems they never have
their fill of that.

176
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:00,836
"He who spectates."
He doesn't mean us.

177
00:11:00,961 --> 00:11:02,338
He means the public.

178
00:11:02,463 --> 00:11:06,300
The public want blood.
The Golem provides it.

179
00:11:06,425 --> 00:11:07,968
Yes!

180
00:11:08,093 --> 00:11:09,637
I'm sure that must be it, sir.

181
00:11:09,762 --> 00:11:10,846
Are you?

182
00:11:10,971 --> 00:11:13,182
I'm not.

183
00:11:13,307 --> 00:11:16,310
Do you feel like a walk
to the library?

184
00:11:26,445 --> 00:11:30,157
Ah! That quotation.
About the gladiatorial ring?

185
00:11:30,282 --> 00:11:32,493
The guilt of the audience
who seek bloodshed?

186
00:11:32,618 --> 00:11:34,370
Well, perhaps
you read it elsewhere.

187
00:11:34,495 --> 00:11:37,498
It's quoted in an old piece by
the essayist Thomas De Quincey.

188
00:11:37,623 --> 00:11:39,267
One I imagine might be
of interest to a man

189
00:11:39,291 --> 00:11:40,769
- in your line of work.
- What's the piece?

190
00:11:40,793 --> 00:11:43,671
"On Murder Considered
as One of the Fine Arts."

191
00:11:43,796 --> 00:11:47,633
A satire about the Ratcliffe
Highway killings of 1811.

192
00:11:49,468 --> 00:11:51,846
Should we talk with
this De Quincey?

193
00:11:51,971 --> 00:11:54,223
He has been dead for 20 years,
Flood,

194
00:11:54,348 --> 00:11:56,141
so it might be a bit...

195
00:12:05,651 --> 00:12:06,861
What is it?

196
00:12:11,991 --> 00:12:12,867
Left to rot.

197
00:12:12,992 --> 00:12:15,077
To kill a whore.

198
00:12:40,185 --> 00:12:41,770
Who last borrowed this book?

199
00:12:41,896 --> 00:12:44,732
This is a reading room,
Inspector, not a local library.

200
00:12:44,857 --> 00:12:46,108
So nothing leaves the premises?

201
00:12:46,233 --> 00:12:48,068
Do you keep
an attendance record?

202
00:12:48,193 --> 00:12:50,073
Of course, but there's
no earthly way of knowing

203
00:12:50,195 --> 00:12:51,906
what anyone read
or when they read it!

204
00:12:52,031 --> 00:12:54,408
Who was here
on September the 24th?

205
00:12:57,578 --> 00:13:00,080
There were four men in
the reading room that day. Why?

206
00:13:00,205 --> 00:13:02,058
It's the final entry in a diary
someone has kept

207
00:13:02,082 --> 00:13:03,459
in the pages of this book.

208
00:13:03,584 --> 00:13:05,395
- Were you here yourself?
- I'm here every day.

209
00:13:05,419 --> 00:13:07,499
Then I must ask you for
a sample of your handwriting.

210
00:13:07,546 --> 00:13:09,089
I'll need the same
from all the staff.

211
00:13:09,214 --> 00:13:10,591
And those four names, please?

212
00:13:10,716 --> 00:13:13,302
The Dan Leno?

213
00:13:13,427 --> 00:13:16,430
And the Karl Marx
and George Gissing.

214
00:13:16,555 --> 00:13:18,974
If you're a follower
of philosophy and literature.

215
00:13:19,099 --> 00:13:21,936
What do you know of John Cree?

216
00:13:22,061 --> 00:13:23,938
Sir?

217
00:13:24,063 --> 00:13:27,775
If he's the same John Cree
I'm thinking of...

218
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:29,276
I believe he's dead.

219
00:13:34,573 --> 00:13:37,117
Place the diary in my files.
Keep it safe.

220
00:13:37,242 --> 00:13:39,119
Find out all you can about
George Gissing,

221
00:13:39,244 --> 00:13:41,121
Karl Marx, and Dan Leno.

222
00:13:41,246 --> 00:13:42,289
Where are you going?

223
00:13:42,414 --> 00:13:44,166
To investigate the dead man.

224
00:13:44,291 --> 00:13:46,794
If he was the Golem,
London's troubles are over.

225
00:13:52,925 --> 00:13:54,677
And you describe your husband

226
00:13:54,802 --> 00:13:58,138
as being in a state of despair

227
00:13:58,263 --> 00:14:01,642
in the weeks leading
to his death, yes?

228
00:14:01,767 --> 00:14:03,078
My husband
had spent several years

229
00:14:03,102 --> 00:14:04,186
writing a play, Your Honor.

230
00:14:04,311 --> 00:14:06,480
Entitled "Misery Junction."

231
00:14:06,605 --> 00:14:09,149
It was... not a success.

232
00:14:09,274 --> 00:14:10,985
I believe he never
recovered from that.

233
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:15,489
And yet he continued to pass
each day in the reading room

234
00:14:15,614 --> 00:14:17,324
at the British Museum,

235
00:14:17,449 --> 00:14:19,159
reading and writing.

236
00:14:19,284 --> 00:14:21,471
A change in mood and a change in
habit are two different things.

237
00:14:21,495 --> 00:14:23,205
On the day of his death,

238
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:25,874
the librarian described
your husband

239
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,336
as being in good spirits.

240
00:14:29,461 --> 00:14:30,879
My husband was adept
at presenting

241
00:14:31,005 --> 00:14:32,381
a false face to the world, sir.

242
00:14:32,506 --> 00:14:36,510
And that is something
you would understand,

243
00:14:36,635 --> 00:14:39,847
is it not, Mrs. Cree?

244
00:14:39,972 --> 00:14:42,391
Playing...

245
00:14:42,516 --> 00:14:44,059
a role?

246
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:47,021
I used to be
a music hall performer,

247
00:14:47,146 --> 00:14:49,023
if that's what you mean.

248
00:14:49,148 --> 00:14:50,959
And what of the role
you play today before this court?

249
00:14:50,983 --> 00:14:55,863
That of a respectable,
educated lady.

250
00:14:55,988 --> 00:14:59,700
You were born out of wedlock,
were you not?

251
00:14:59,825 --> 00:15:01,869
Yes, sir.

252
00:15:01,994 --> 00:15:06,874
As a child,
you stitched sailcloth

253
00:15:06,999 --> 00:15:10,711
and passed much time with men.

254
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:16,550
I can assure you I was
a God-fearing child.

255
00:15:16,675 --> 00:15:18,385
An innocent.

256
00:15:18,510 --> 00:15:21,764
I was tasked by my mother to
deliver our sails to the docks.

257
00:15:21,889 --> 00:15:24,391
Encountering men was not
something I could hope to avoid.

258
00:15:24,516 --> 00:15:25,893
Here you go, good as new.

259
00:15:26,018 --> 00:15:27,227
Carry that all the way?

260
00:15:27,352 --> 00:15:28,937
Look at your poor hands, Lizzie.

261
00:15:29,063 --> 00:15:30,999
Me ma says I'm made for
the bloodtubs with these hands.

262
00:15:31,023 --> 00:15:33,275
Don't you dare run off
and join the theater.

263
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,069
These sails ain't
gonna mend themselves.

264
00:15:35,194 --> 00:15:36,570
I like the comics.

265
00:15:36,695 --> 00:15:39,073
Charlie's gonna take me
to see Dan Leno one day.

266
00:15:39,198 --> 00:15:41,283
Aren't you, Charlie,
when I'm older?

267
00:15:43,535 --> 00:15:47,081
♪ The guards and the porters
came round her by score ♪

268
00:15:47,206 --> 00:15:48,624
♪ And she told them all ♪

269
00:15:48,749 --> 00:15:50,751
♪ She'd never had her ticket
punched before ♪

270
00:15:54,254 --> 00:15:55,732
Dan Leno was never that blue.

271
00:15:55,756 --> 00:15:57,257
Did Charlie teach you that?

272
00:15:57,382 --> 00:15:59,593
Just don't let your ma hear it.
She'll kill ya.

273
00:15:59,718 --> 00:16:02,596
What's it mean?

274
00:16:02,721 --> 00:16:04,765
If you want, I'll show you.

275
00:16:04,890 --> 00:16:06,475
Me mum will be wanting me home,

276
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:09,144
if you'll give me our pay.

277
00:16:09,269 --> 00:16:11,647
Money's in my hut.

278
00:16:24,576 --> 00:16:27,079
What took you so long?

279
00:16:35,087 --> 00:16:37,965
Has a man laid hands on you?

280
00:16:38,090 --> 00:16:39,633
You liar.

281
00:16:39,758 --> 00:16:41,510
I fell.

282
00:16:41,635 --> 00:16:43,345
Come here.

283
00:16:45,639 --> 00:16:46,974
What did I do wrong?

284
00:16:47,099 --> 00:16:48,809
Mother, no, please.

285
00:16:48,934 --> 00:16:50,310
Did I not teach you well enough?

286
00:16:50,435 --> 00:16:54,314
No, I beg you!

287
00:16:54,439 --> 00:16:55,649
Come here.

288
00:17:00,946 --> 00:17:03,157
You want me to go
to heaven, don't you?

289
00:17:03,282 --> 00:17:05,492
That place will keep you
from heaven, Lizzie.

290
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,668
That is enough, Mrs. Cree!

291
00:17:19,798 --> 00:17:22,176
Court is adjourned for lunch!

292
00:17:30,142 --> 00:17:32,019
Anyone come by
from The Era newspaper?

293
00:17:32,144 --> 00:17:33,520
I'm expecting a package.

294
00:17:33,645 --> 00:17:34,646
No package.

295
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:38,150
Just this.

296
00:17:44,323 --> 00:17:46,325
John Cree.

297
00:17:49,494 --> 00:17:51,580
No luck getting a sample
of Cree's handwriting

298
00:17:51,705 --> 00:17:54,208
from his old employers,
I'm afraid, sir.

299
00:17:54,333 --> 00:17:57,044
They don't keep
reporters' submissions.

300
00:17:57,169 --> 00:17:58,879
Had a more recent
portrait, though.

301
00:17:59,004 --> 00:18:01,548
And I've asked archives for all
the files on Gissing and Marx.

302
00:18:01,673 --> 00:18:04,885
Very good. See if
they have anything on Leno.

303
00:18:21,068 --> 00:18:24,238
September the 5th, 1880.

304
00:18:24,363 --> 00:18:26,406
It was a fine bright evening...

305
00:18:26,531 --> 00:18:29,243
And I could feel
a murder coming on.

306
00:18:29,368 --> 00:18:32,412
Since it was to be
my first show,

307
00:18:32,537 --> 00:18:35,916
I decided by way of inspiration
to pay a visit to the site

308
00:18:36,041 --> 00:18:38,752
of the immortal
Ratcliffe Highway murders.

309
00:18:38,877 --> 00:18:41,588
More than half a century ago
on this sacred spot,

310
00:18:41,713 --> 00:18:44,633
an entire family was
dispatched into eternity

311
00:18:44,758 --> 00:18:47,094
by a man named John Williams,

312
00:18:47,219 --> 00:18:48,929
a man Thomas De Quincey
described

313
00:18:49,054 --> 00:18:51,640
as an artist of exquisite skill.

314
00:18:51,765 --> 00:18:54,768
And yet now the site
of his greatest work was defiled

315
00:18:54,893 --> 00:18:57,479
by a seller
of secondhand clothes.

316
00:18:57,604 --> 00:19:00,941
We're closed, I'm afraid, sir.

317
00:19:01,066 --> 00:19:02,484
Oh, sorry.

318
00:19:02,609 --> 00:19:04,611
The door was open.

319
00:19:04,736 --> 00:19:05,779
No matter.

320
00:19:05,904 --> 00:19:09,283
I'll be sure to return.

321
00:19:09,408 --> 00:19:12,619
But I was
a beginner, an understudy.

322
00:19:12,744 --> 00:19:15,622
Not yet ready
for the great stage.

323
00:19:27,759 --> 00:19:31,179
An artist must
perfect his craft,

324
00:19:31,305 --> 00:19:34,808
and tonight I would start
with a small, private rehearsal.

325
00:19:34,933 --> 00:19:36,310
Gin?

326
00:19:36,435 --> 00:19:38,520
Don't you think
you've had enough?

327
00:19:38,645 --> 00:19:40,480
I want you awake.

328
00:19:40,605 --> 00:19:42,816
Or else you'll miss all the fun.

329
00:20:04,629 --> 00:20:07,174
I felt that she
suspected my game from the start

330
00:20:07,299 --> 00:20:09,009
and offered herself willingly,

331
00:20:09,134 --> 00:20:10,844
warm in the knowledge
that the world

332
00:20:10,969 --> 00:20:13,889
would soon be forced to confront
the plight of her kind.

333
00:20:22,314 --> 00:20:23,523
I took out her eyes in case

334
00:20:23,648 --> 00:20:25,692
my image had been
imprinted upon them,

335
00:20:25,817 --> 00:20:27,628
and washed the blood
from my hands with the gin

336
00:20:27,652 --> 00:20:29,571
in her chamber pot.

337
00:20:29,696 --> 00:20:34,076
My first performance
was complete.

338
00:20:54,679 --> 00:20:59,726
Mrs. Cree? I'm Inspector Kildare
of Scotland Yard.

339
00:20:59,851 --> 00:21:01,204
I suppose you're here
to chastise me

340
00:21:01,228 --> 00:21:03,230
for my candor in court.
On the contrary,

341
00:21:03,355 --> 00:21:04,940
I applaud you for it.

342
00:21:05,065 --> 00:21:06,733
It's all too easy
to imagine that those

343
00:21:06,858 --> 00:21:08,068
who have enjoyed success

344
00:21:08,193 --> 00:21:10,737
have never known suffering.

345
00:21:10,862 --> 00:21:14,074
Well, to quote the great
Dan Leno, "Here we are again."

346
00:21:14,199 --> 00:21:17,953
I'm afraid I'm not a frequenter
of the music halls.

347
00:21:18,078 --> 00:21:20,080
He portrays
the suffering of women.

348
00:21:20,205 --> 00:21:22,082
My gender becomes
inured to injustice.

349
00:21:22,207 --> 00:21:23,750
We expect it.

350
00:21:23,875 --> 00:21:26,086
Until we can greet it
merely with a shrug.

351
00:21:26,211 --> 00:21:29,256
Oh.
I understood he was a comic.

352
00:21:29,381 --> 00:21:33,760
The line between comedy
and tragedy is a fine one.

353
00:21:33,885 --> 00:21:35,887
You haven't told me
why you're here.

354
00:21:39,724 --> 00:21:42,811
I wish to put it to you that
I know why you might have had

355
00:21:42,936 --> 00:21:44,938
good reason
to poison your husband.

356
00:21:45,063 --> 00:21:46,940
Please, sir, I'm hoarse
from repetition.

357
00:21:47,065 --> 00:21:49,043
There will be no confession.
My plea has been made.

358
00:21:49,067 --> 00:21:52,320
Mrs. Cree, I'm not
assigned to your case.

359
00:21:52,446 --> 00:21:55,782
I'm here because your husband
is a suspect in...

360
00:21:55,907 --> 00:21:57,117
another matter.

361
00:21:57,242 --> 00:22:00,954
What matter?

362
00:22:01,079 --> 00:22:03,623
A journal has been found.

363
00:22:03,748 --> 00:22:05,625
I'd like to compare
the handwriting with his.

364
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:07,961
Might you have anything
that he wrote?

365
00:22:08,086 --> 00:22:09,963
- His papers...
- He burned them, yes.

366
00:22:10,088 --> 00:22:14,968
Mrs. Cree, if your husband were
found to have committed murder,

367
00:22:15,093 --> 00:22:17,637
your claims of suicide
gain weight.

368
00:22:17,762 --> 00:22:19,306
Do you understand?
You could go free.

369
00:22:19,431 --> 00:22:20,515
Murder?

370
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,809
I'm investigating
a series of deaths.

371
00:22:22,934 --> 00:22:24,912
They're calling them
the "Limehouse Golem" murders.

372
00:22:24,936 --> 00:22:27,248
You can't honestly think my
husband capable of such things?

373
00:22:27,272 --> 00:22:29,983
It's not my place
to have an opinion.

374
00:22:30,108 --> 00:22:32,027
I just follow the threads.

375
00:22:32,152 --> 00:22:34,654
The newspaper said it was
your first murder case.

376
00:22:34,779 --> 00:22:36,490
That's a rotten kind
of chance to be given.

377
00:22:36,615 --> 00:22:40,160
Excuse me?

378
00:22:40,285 --> 00:22:42,996
I wanted to be
a serious actress, you know.

379
00:22:43,121 --> 00:22:45,207
Had my chance once, too.

380
00:22:45,332 --> 00:22:47,167
They don't give you another.

381
00:22:50,295 --> 00:22:53,340
That's why I'd like to help you.

382
00:22:53,465 --> 00:22:55,008
You needn't feign
interest in me.

383
00:22:55,133 --> 00:22:58,345
There's nothing
feigned about it.

384
00:22:58,470 --> 00:23:02,224
Raised in cruelty and yet
you stood tall and thrived.

385
00:23:02,349 --> 00:23:04,684
That's...

386
00:23:04,809 --> 00:23:06,144
uncommon.

387
00:23:10,482 --> 00:23:13,193
My mother did me the great
service of dying young.

388
00:23:17,656 --> 00:23:19,866
I was raised in the music halls.

389
00:24:14,713 --> 00:24:16,256
You want to buy some sweets,
miss?

390
00:24:16,381 --> 00:24:17,591
Hey, get out of here.

391
00:24:27,726 --> 00:24:29,269
What?

392
00:24:29,394 --> 00:24:32,939
- What a play.
- It was.

393
00:24:46,911 --> 00:24:47,996
It's halfway over, love.

394
00:24:48,121 --> 00:24:49,664
Come back tomorrow.

395
00:24:51,916 --> 00:24:54,169
All right. Go on in.

396
00:24:54,294 --> 00:24:55,962
You can still catch Leno
if you're quick.

397
00:24:56,087 --> 00:24:57,505
God bless.

398
00:25:31,456 --> 00:25:32,999
All right, there we go!

399
00:25:34,959 --> 00:25:38,171
Ah!
What fine manners.

400
00:25:38,296 --> 00:25:40,340
Such fine manners!

401
00:25:40,465 --> 00:25:42,175
I feel as if I'm at a tea party.

402
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:46,846
Please note the oxtail in the
jelly tonight is three pence.

403
00:25:46,971 --> 00:25:48,223
- Now...
- That's for later.

404
00:25:48,348 --> 00:25:49,659
Without any further ado,

405
00:25:49,683 --> 00:25:52,185
may I introduce
the man of the hour,

406
00:25:52,310 --> 00:25:55,397
Mr. Dan Leno!

407
00:26:04,197 --> 00:26:06,700

00:28:00,104 --> 00:28:01,981
Pies, pies, pies, pies.

431
00:28:02,106 --> 00:28:04,818
All in dire need of pies.
I'll tell you what, dearie.

432
00:28:04,943 --> 00:28:06,820
Seeing as you're here again,
be a good girl.

433
00:28:06,945 --> 00:28:08,655
Give Uncle a hand.

434
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:11,157
Be careful with that.
All too good to drop.

435
00:28:11,282 --> 00:28:12,992
As the pregnant woman
said to the midwife!

436
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:16,996
Here you are, Vic.

437
00:28:17,121 --> 00:28:18,599
- A little bit of what you fancy.
- Ooh, pie.

438
00:28:18,623 --> 00:28:21,334
John John.

439
00:28:21,459 --> 00:28:24,879
Aveline, dear, nice and hot,
just as you like it.

440
00:28:25,004 --> 00:28:28,675
But not quite so big.

441
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,677
Thanks, Uncle.

442
00:28:44,148 --> 00:28:47,026
Last one's for you, Mr. Leno.

443
00:28:47,151 --> 00:28:49,070
Mr. Leno, is it?

444
00:28:49,195 --> 00:28:51,865
Did you find her at the grocers,
Uncle?

445
00:28:51,990 --> 00:28:54,033
She's certainly a green one.

446
00:28:54,158 --> 00:28:57,871
Now, now, girls.

447
00:28:57,996 --> 00:29:00,373
- What's your name?
- Lizzie, sir.

448
00:29:00,498 --> 00:29:02,876
Lambeth Marsh Lizzie.

449
00:29:03,001 --> 00:29:05,378
I thought I could
smell marsh gas.

450
00:29:05,503 --> 00:29:07,881
Oh, don't let 'em dumb you.
It's just their way.

451
00:29:08,006 --> 00:29:10,216
And call me Dan.

452
00:29:10,341 --> 00:29:11,718
This is Tommy Farr,

453
00:29:11,843 --> 00:29:15,054
theater manager
and keeper of the bunce.

454
00:29:15,179 --> 00:29:17,599
Speaking of which, we owe you
something for your trouble.

455
00:29:22,186 --> 00:29:24,397
What in God's name did
they have you doing down there

456
00:29:24,522 --> 00:29:26,274
in those marshes?

457
00:29:28,067 --> 00:29:29,903
Digging graves.

458
00:29:30,028 --> 00:29:31,571
Five years it was
before I found out

459
00:29:31,696 --> 00:29:34,240
you're supposed to use a shovel.

460
00:29:34,365 --> 00:29:35,950
I like this one.

461
00:29:36,075 --> 00:29:37,243
Can you read?

462
00:29:37,368 --> 00:29:38,620
Like a native.

463
00:29:38,745 --> 00:29:40,538
Here.

464
00:29:45,543 --> 00:29:46,920
"What's fame?"

465
00:29:47,045 --> 00:29:49,297
A fancy'd life
in other's breath.

466
00:29:49,422 --> 00:29:52,759
A thing beyond us,
even before our death.

467
00:29:52,884 --> 00:29:55,595
All we feel of it begins
and ends in the small circle

468
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:58,806
"of our foes and friends."

469
00:29:58,932 --> 00:30:01,434
That's my favorite line.

470
00:30:01,559 --> 00:30:04,437
Alexander Pope.

471
00:30:04,562 --> 00:30:05,939
Are you looking for work,
Lizzie?

472
00:30:06,064 --> 00:30:07,482
Yeah.

473
00:30:07,607 --> 00:30:10,109
Only, our prompter ran off
with a Lion Comique.

474
00:30:10,234 --> 00:30:11,444
And it won't all be lavender.

475
00:30:11,569 --> 00:30:12,755
There'll be some
fetch and carry,

476
00:30:12,779 --> 00:30:14,280
but there's decent bunce

477
00:30:14,405 --> 00:30:18,284
and room in the digs
with the dancers.

478
00:30:18,409 --> 00:30:20,954
What do you say?

479
00:30:21,079 --> 00:30:27,001
How would you describe
your relationship with Dan Leno?

480
00:30:27,126 --> 00:30:28,461
We were friends, sir.

481
00:30:28,586 --> 00:30:31,297
And he was... my mentor.

482
00:30:31,422 --> 00:30:32,966
He took me under his wing.

483
00:30:33,091 --> 00:30:35,301
"No, Mrs. Killian"...

484
00:30:38,137 --> 00:30:39,806
Where did you learn
to read and write

485
00:30:39,931 --> 00:30:41,683
if you didn't go to school?

486
00:30:41,808 --> 00:30:45,478
My mother's Bible, I suppose.

487
00:30:47,313 --> 00:30:49,816
Oh, and speaking of books...

488
00:30:49,941 --> 00:30:51,526
Oi.

489
00:30:51,651 --> 00:30:53,152
- Thank you.
- What?

490
00:30:53,277 --> 00:30:54,821
Finished already?

491
00:30:54,946 --> 00:30:56,823
That's the second this week!

492
00:30:58,950 --> 00:31:01,369
I think books might be
my first love.

493
00:31:01,494 --> 00:31:05,873
And I've always heard it said
that first love is insatiable.

494
00:31:05,999 --> 00:31:07,834
Sod writing new gags,

495
00:31:07,959 --> 00:31:10,503
they can have the Milkmaid again
tonight and like it.

496
00:31:10,628 --> 00:31:13,673
I want to show you something.

497
00:31:13,798 --> 00:31:15,049
Where are we going?

498
00:31:15,174 --> 00:31:16,342
You'll see.

499
00:31:19,846 --> 00:31:21,848
A whole room?

500
00:31:21,973 --> 00:31:24,225
Full of books?

501
00:31:24,350 --> 00:31:26,144
Every inch of it.

502
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:30,290
People come here just to read?

503
00:31:30,314 --> 00:31:34,027
To read. To learn. To create.

504
00:31:34,152 --> 00:31:37,196
It's like... a great furnace.

505
00:31:37,321 --> 00:31:40,533
I mean, the future
is being forged here.

506
00:31:40,658 --> 00:31:44,871
Writers, philosophers,
men of science.

507
00:31:44,996 --> 00:31:47,582
All the way down
to lowly clowns like me.

508
00:31:47,707 --> 00:31:50,585
The ladies' table is upstairs.

509
00:31:50,710 --> 00:31:54,213
Oh, thanking you
kindly, good sir.

510
00:31:54,338 --> 00:31:56,549
You were never
more than friends?

511
00:31:56,674 --> 00:31:58,051
No, sir.

512
00:31:58,176 --> 00:32:01,721
I believe he felt
protective of me.

513
00:32:01,846 --> 00:32:04,223
The prosecution wishes
to remind the court

514
00:32:04,348 --> 00:32:06,392
that Mr. Leno
was recently questioned

515
00:32:06,517 --> 00:32:10,063
in connection with
the "Limehouse Golem" murders.

516
00:32:10,188 --> 00:32:11,331
Objection, Your Honor!

517
00:32:12,857 --> 00:32:14,337
Order, order!

518
00:32:17,695 --> 00:32:19,405
Inspector Kildare!

519
00:32:19,530 --> 00:32:21,407
Kildare!

520
00:32:30,708 --> 00:32:32,585
Why was I not aware

521
00:32:32,710 --> 00:32:34,754
that Dan Leno
was previously a suspect?

522
00:32:34,879 --> 00:32:36,631
You tell me, Kildare.

523
00:32:36,756 --> 00:32:38,424
It was in every daily newspaper.

524
00:32:38,549 --> 00:32:40,968
But not in the brief
you gave me.

525
00:32:41,094 --> 00:32:43,096
Well, he was eliminated
from inquiries.

526
00:32:43,221 --> 00:32:44,931
The, uh, report's
on my desk somewhere.

527
00:32:45,056 --> 00:32:48,601
You didn't think to place
it in your files?

528
00:32:48,726 --> 00:32:51,312
The streets of London
run red with blood,

529
00:32:51,437 --> 00:32:55,775
and you concern yourself
with paperwork?

530
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:58,486
You'd have made
a fine politician, Kildare,

531
00:32:58,611 --> 00:33:01,614
were you not
the topic of such...

532
00:33:01,739 --> 00:33:03,241
speculation.

533
00:33:08,412 --> 00:33:09,956
I wouldn't read that.

534
00:33:10,081 --> 00:33:12,333
Disgraceful lies, all of it.

535
00:33:12,458 --> 00:33:14,961
The poor woman spoke
of misfortune and cruelty

536
00:33:15,086 --> 00:33:16,504
and they've turned it upon her.

537
00:33:16,629 --> 00:33:18,965
Makes my blood boil.

538
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:23,177
Seems your beloved Leno
wasn't actually a suspect.

539
00:33:23,302 --> 00:33:24,804
My beloved?

540
00:33:24,929 --> 00:33:26,472
What man doesn't enjoy Dan Leno?

541
00:33:26,597 --> 00:33:28,641
One who doesn't care
for the music halls?

542
00:33:28,766 --> 00:33:32,311
Well, I'll venture to say you've
not seen the right shows, sir.

543
00:33:32,436 --> 00:33:34,147
If you ever wish
for a recommendation...

544
00:33:34,272 --> 00:33:38,484
He was questioned in regard
to Alice Stanton's gown.

545
00:33:38,609 --> 00:33:41,654
A label sewn into it
identified it as his,

546
00:33:41,779 --> 00:33:44,323
a stage costume.
So he knew her?

547
00:33:44,448 --> 00:33:46,135
"Leno stated that
the dress was part"

548
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:47,869
of a consignment
of stage costumes

549
00:33:47,994 --> 00:33:49,162
he'd sold a year earlier

550
00:33:49,287 --> 00:33:50,830
"to a purveyor of
secondhand clothes."

551
00:33:50,955 --> 00:33:52,808
And apparently he provided
a receipt which proved it.

552
00:33:52,832 --> 00:33:54,309
Well, then it was merely
a coincidence.

553
00:33:54,333 --> 00:33:56,335
Perhaps.

554
00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:58,045
As is perhaps the fact

555
00:33:58,171 --> 00:34:00,173
that the purveyor of
secondhand clothes

556
00:34:00,298 --> 00:34:03,676
was the late Mr. Gerrard,

557
00:34:03,801 --> 00:34:05,678
murdered at Ratcliffe Highway.

558
00:34:05,803 --> 00:34:07,388
We should get a sample
of his hand.

559
00:34:07,513 --> 00:34:09,491
Quite. And can we find out
what's happened to that dress?

560
00:34:09,515 --> 00:34:10,951
It wasn't with the rest
of the evidence.

561
00:34:10,975 --> 00:34:12,518
I'll look into it, sir.

562
00:34:23,029 --> 00:34:25,031
Why didn't you tell me
you questioned Dan Leno?

563
00:34:25,156 --> 00:34:26,741
I haven't.
Though I shall have to.

564
00:34:26,866 --> 00:34:28,034
In court they said you had.

565
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:31,412
Not me.
Before I joined the case.

566
00:34:31,537 --> 00:34:35,249
So is he a suspect or not?

567
00:34:35,374 --> 00:34:36,709
Do you think he should be?

568
00:34:36,834 --> 00:34:38,211
Please don't play games with me.

569
00:34:38,336 --> 00:34:39,754
I have no desire to!

570
00:34:39,879 --> 00:34:41,547
The Golem is still at large.

571
00:34:41,672 --> 00:34:44,217
Wasting my time
could cost lives.

572
00:34:49,847 --> 00:34:52,099
Unless you are correct
about my husband.

573
00:34:52,225 --> 00:34:54,727
If the Golem is no more,
then none are at risk.

574
00:34:56,854 --> 00:34:59,232
Besides yours...

575
00:34:59,357 --> 00:35:04,403
You needn't hang, Mrs. Cree.

576
00:35:04,528 --> 00:35:06,906
Please call me Lizzie.

577
00:35:08,407 --> 00:35:10,743
Just assist me in assisting you.

578
00:35:10,868 --> 00:35:12,286
I can't tell you
what I don't know.

579
00:35:12,411 --> 00:35:15,539
All I ask is that you
tell me what you do.

580
00:35:18,042 --> 00:35:19,460
Where should I start?

581
00:35:19,585 --> 00:35:23,589
How you came to know
John Cree, perhaps.

582
00:35:25,883 --> 00:35:27,635
Jim is very partial to me!

583
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:29,262
Though never a word has he said.

584
00:35:29,387 --> 00:35:31,639
Right now he's lodging
with Mrs. Kelly.

585
00:35:31,764 --> 00:35:32,974
Do you know Mrs. Kelly?

586
00:35:33,099 --> 00:35:35,268
Don't you know Mrs. Kelly?

587
00:35:35,393 --> 00:35:37,311
Good life-a-mighty,
don't look so simple.

588
00:35:37,436 --> 00:35:39,480
Everybody knows Mrs. Kelly.

589
00:35:39,605 --> 00:35:41,208
Am I... Am I going too fast
for you, love?

590
00:35:41,232 --> 00:35:42,441
You spoof it, I'll write it.

591
00:35:42,566 --> 00:35:43,943
Oh, she's a mean one,
Mrs. Kelly.

592
00:35:44,068 --> 00:35:45,254
She'll buy half a dozen oysters

593
00:35:45,278 --> 00:35:46,380
and eat them
in front of a mirror

594
00:35:46,404 --> 00:35:48,489
to make them look like a dozen.

595
00:35:48,614 --> 00:35:50,157
What about...

596
00:35:50,283 --> 00:35:53,452
"I saw her take a coin
from her purse the other day,"

597
00:35:53,577 --> 00:35:54,829
and I swear,

598
00:35:54,954 --> 00:35:56,455
I saw Queen Victoria blinking

599
00:35:56,580 --> 00:35:57,832
at the sight of sunlight"?

600
00:36:00,418 --> 00:36:02,503
Are those petticoats ironed yet?

601
00:36:02,628 --> 00:36:04,005
Good.

602
00:36:04,130 --> 00:36:07,300
Then you can come over here
and lace me up.

603
00:36:12,263 --> 00:36:13,806
Fuck off, Victor.

604
00:36:13,931 --> 00:36:15,141
Come on, dear.

605
00:36:15,266 --> 00:36:16,976
You know I can't see
from the back row,

606
00:36:17,101 --> 00:36:18,477
and I do so love a double act.

607
00:36:18,602 --> 00:36:20,187
Victor, out, out!

608
00:36:20,313 --> 00:36:22,315
- Come on.
- Just a joke, Dan.

609
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:25,192
Get that, will you, Lizzie.

610
00:36:25,318 --> 00:36:27,820
That'll be the reporter
for my interview.

611
00:36:29,155 --> 00:36:30,823
Hmm, you're new.

612
00:36:30,948 --> 00:36:33,534
Lizzie.
Seen you before, haven't I?

613
00:36:33,659 --> 00:36:35,036
You work for The Era.

614
00:36:35,161 --> 00:36:37,038
I'm a playwright,
but yes, indeed,

615
00:36:37,163 --> 00:36:38,539
The Era puts food on my table.

616
00:36:38,664 --> 00:36:42,335
For now.

617
00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:43,878
John Cree.

618
00:36:44,003 --> 00:36:47,006
You got to sweep it.

619
00:36:47,131 --> 00:36:48,382
Shall we?

620
00:36:48,507 --> 00:36:51,510
Can you help me dress, love?

621
00:36:51,635 --> 00:36:53,346
Threw me out the window.

622
00:36:55,639 --> 00:36:57,058
The usual for everyone?

623
00:36:57,183 --> 00:36:58,327
Oh, yes, please, darling.

624
00:36:58,351 --> 00:36:59,494
What about you, dear?

625
00:36:59,518 --> 00:37:00,853
A baked potato.

626
00:37:00,978 --> 00:37:03,356
You don't fancy a bit
of meat tonight, Lizzie?

627
00:37:03,481 --> 00:37:04,523
What's the matter, Dan?

628
00:37:04,648 --> 00:37:05,858
She must be over 16.

629
00:37:05,983 --> 00:37:07,193
No, I mustn't.

630
00:37:07,318 --> 00:37:09,195
So, Lizzie, what's your act?

631
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:10,696
Do tell.

632
00:37:10,821 --> 00:37:13,366
Uh, it's called
"Little Lizzie the dogsbody."

633
00:37:13,491 --> 00:37:14,867
Mm-hmm.

634
00:37:14,992 --> 00:37:16,178
Yeah, I do all manner
of gags with an iron

635
00:37:16,202 --> 00:37:18,204
and a pile of dirty smalls.

636
00:37:18,329 --> 00:37:19,747
Oh, that sounds extraordinary.

637
00:37:19,872 --> 00:37:21,374
It is.

638
00:37:21,499 --> 00:37:23,209
She's dumbing you, John.

639
00:37:23,334 --> 00:37:25,211
She means she's the prompt.

640
00:37:25,336 --> 00:37:27,713
I was only saying earlier
you might make a good gagger.

641
00:37:27,838 --> 00:37:29,483
She's got the dial for it,
hasn't she, Uncle?

642
00:37:29,507 --> 00:37:30,883
Say that again.

643
00:37:31,008 --> 00:37:33,094
She's got the dial for it,
hasn't she, Uncle?

644
00:37:33,219 --> 00:37:35,054
Oh, thank you.

645
00:37:35,179 --> 00:37:37,056
I don't know where
you put it all, Victor.

646
00:37:37,181 --> 00:37:38,724
You must have hollow legs.

647
00:37:38,849 --> 00:37:41,268
I can hold as much as the next
man, thank you very much.

648
00:37:41,394 --> 00:37:43,270
Pour a quart in a pint pot,
you'll make a mess.

649
00:37:43,396 --> 00:37:45,272
Nonsense.
I'm as right as rain.

650
00:37:45,398 --> 00:37:47,775
Can't keep a good man down,
as they say,

651
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:50,236
but I know where you can
put a good man up.

652
00:37:50,361 --> 00:37:51,612
Aah!

653
00:37:51,737 --> 00:37:53,572
What in God's name is going on?

654
00:37:53,697 --> 00:37:54,907
Nothing.

655
00:37:55,032 --> 00:37:56,909
Lizzie stepped on my foot
by mistake.

656
00:37:57,034 --> 00:37:59,745
No harm done.

657
00:37:59,870 --> 00:38:03,290
I'm taking Lizzie home.

658
00:38:03,416 --> 00:38:05,251
This is no place
for an innocent young girl.

659
00:38:05,376 --> 00:38:06,752
Come, gentlemen.
No harm done.

660
00:38:06,877 --> 00:38:08,021
As the executioner said
to the hanged man.

661
00:38:08,045 --> 00:38:09,189
I'll... I'll... I'll take her.

662
00:38:09,213 --> 00:38:10,357
There's no need.
I can walk alone.

663
00:38:10,381 --> 00:38:11,924
No, I'll not hear of it.

664
00:38:12,049 --> 00:38:13,527
Please, your food will get cold.
I'll be quite safe.

665
00:38:13,551 --> 00:38:14,861
Our digs are just
around the corner.

666
00:38:14,885 --> 00:38:17,763
Then I'll be back in good time.

667
00:38:17,888 --> 00:38:19,098
Watch yourself, Victor.

668
00:38:19,223 --> 00:38:20,599
John Cree's got a temper.

669
00:38:20,724 --> 00:38:22,768
I'm not afraid of him.

670
00:38:39,243 --> 00:38:42,496
Lizzie...

671
00:38:42,621 --> 00:38:45,124
I'm afraid there's...

672
00:38:45,249 --> 00:38:47,001
awful news.

673
00:38:47,126 --> 00:38:51,464
Victor was found at the bottom
of the stairs last night.

674
00:38:51,589 --> 00:38:53,841
Lizzie...

675
00:38:53,966 --> 00:38:56,469
are you trying to tell me
you suspected John Cree?

676
00:38:56,594 --> 00:38:59,138
I didn't say that.
I merely said he was protective.

677
00:38:59,263 --> 00:39:01,807
You said the same of Dan Leno.

678
00:39:01,932 --> 00:39:03,809
I seem to ignite the urge
in men.

679
00:39:06,479 --> 00:39:09,482
He was a terrible little turd.

680
00:39:09,607 --> 00:39:12,151
But he was our
terrible little turd.

681
00:39:12,276 --> 00:39:13,986
That's it,

682
00:39:14,111 --> 00:39:17,323
cheer up.

683
00:39:17,448 --> 00:39:19,533
I've suggested that we make

684
00:39:19,658 --> 00:39:23,329
tonight's show
a special tribute.

685
00:39:23,454 --> 00:39:26,332
We'll give him a grand send-off,

686
00:39:26,457 --> 00:39:27,708
won't we?

687
00:39:27,833 --> 00:39:30,002
Did you ever speak
of it to John?

688
00:39:30,127 --> 00:39:31,337
No.

689
00:39:31,462 --> 00:39:33,380
I never spoke of it to anyone.

690
00:39:33,506 --> 00:39:36,008
I preferred to
chalk it up to fate.

691
00:39:36,133 --> 00:39:38,414
Would you rather owe your
happiness to simple good fortune

692
00:39:38,469 --> 00:39:41,555
or to an unspeakable
act of violence?

693
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:45,684
Little Victor's death
brought you happiness?

694
00:39:45,809 --> 00:39:48,187
Little Victor's death
gave me life.

695
00:40:08,666 --> 00:40:10,477
The people come through
the doors and they laugh.

696
00:40:10,501 --> 00:40:12,646
Dan, I was hoping you'd
wipe your ass with the papers.

697
00:40:12,670 --> 00:40:14,314
- You don't read them.
- What more can I do?

698
00:40:14,338 --> 00:40:16,048
Dan?

699
00:40:16,173 --> 00:40:19,593
Do you think I could pay my
respects to Little Victor, too?

700
00:40:19,718 --> 00:40:21,387
Good God.

701
00:40:21,512 --> 00:40:23,055
This is a funny thing.

702
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:24,390
What a funny thing.

703
00:40:24,515 --> 00:40:25,724
Just a little song.

704
00:40:25,849 --> 00:40:27,560
A blue one maybe,
Victor would like that.

705
00:40:27,685 --> 00:40:30,062
A salty sailor act,
as if I were a man.

706
00:40:30,187 --> 00:40:32,398
- It could be a scream.
- Go on, then, Lizzie.

707
00:40:32,523 --> 00:40:34,066
Give it a try.

708
00:40:34,191 --> 00:40:36,402
Isn't that costume a little bit
small for you, dear?

709
00:40:36,527 --> 00:40:37,736

Oblige again!

00:42:06,617 --> 00:42:08,535
Lizzie, oblige again!

734
00:42:08,661 --> 00:42:10,329
They want more!

735
00:42:10,454 --> 00:42:11,894
I don't have any more.

736
00:42:11,955 --> 00:42:13,832
You have them!

737
00:42:29,848 --> 00:42:33,185
Would you look at these
rotten cotton gloves?

738
00:42:33,310 --> 00:42:35,354
That saltwater
will shrink anything.

739
00:42:38,482 --> 00:42:42,361
Least that's what the ladies
down at the docks tell me.

740
00:42:51,161 --> 00:42:52,806
I don't know, I just looked at
the gloves and they looked

741
00:42:52,830 --> 00:42:54,683
so absurd that the line just
came to me like that.

742
00:42:54,707 --> 00:42:55,874
"Them rotten cotton gloves!"

743
00:42:55,999 --> 00:42:57,584
It could be your catchphrase.

744
00:42:57,710 --> 00:42:59,712
No need to dip
into the blue bag so much.

745
00:42:59,837 --> 00:43:01,380
They loved it.
They loved it all.

746
00:43:01,505 --> 00:43:02,381
They love you.

747
00:43:02,506 --> 00:43:04,049
And who wouldn't.

748
00:43:04,174 --> 00:43:05,527
- Uncle!
- Careful, Uncle.

749
00:43:05,551 --> 00:43:07,386
With Lizzie in that getup,

750
00:43:07,511 --> 00:43:09,489
anyone looking over might think
you have an eye for the boys.

751
00:43:09,513 --> 00:43:10,824
Well, let them think
what they like.

752
00:43:10,848 --> 00:43:12,891
More drinks, please!

753
00:43:13,016 --> 00:43:14,536
Little Victor wouldn't
have wanted any of us

754
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:16,520
standing up at the end
of the night.

755
00:43:18,397 --> 00:43:20,107
I'm tired, I'm afraid.

756
00:43:20,232 --> 00:43:24,403
Walk me home, will you, John?

757
00:43:24,528 --> 00:43:26,071
I'll come back.

758
00:43:30,701 --> 00:43:32,911
Why are you still
wearing your costume?

759
00:43:33,036 --> 00:43:36,415
I hoped it might
keep the men away.

760
00:43:36,540 --> 00:43:40,085
You prefer the girls, Lizzie?

761
00:43:40,210 --> 00:43:41,920
Nothing wrong in that if you do.

762
00:43:42,045 --> 00:43:43,925
Come on, no need to make
something from nothing.

763
00:43:44,047 --> 00:43:46,467
- You dress like a girl.
- Yeah, on stage.

764
00:43:50,095 --> 00:43:51,764
Well, if you really care,

765
00:43:51,889 --> 00:43:54,433
maybe I like
how I felt on stage.

766
00:43:54,558 --> 00:43:56,810
I care.

767
00:43:56,935 --> 00:44:00,439
I care to see you happy.

768
00:44:00,564 --> 00:44:02,983
Tonight...

769
00:44:03,108 --> 00:44:05,652
tonight, you look happy.

770
00:44:05,778 --> 00:44:07,338
We still need
handwriting samples

771
00:44:07,446 --> 00:44:08,781
from Marx, Gissing, and Leno.

772
00:44:08,906 --> 00:44:10,383
Did you speak
with the maid again?

773
00:44:10,407 --> 00:44:12,618
Aveline Ortega?
I did, sir.

774
00:44:12,743 --> 00:44:14,220
She won't hear a word
said against him.

775
00:44:14,244 --> 00:44:15,597
You showed her
the journal entries?

776
00:44:15,621 --> 00:44:17,790
She swore
the writing wasn't his.

777
00:44:17,915 --> 00:44:19,893
If Cree were our Golem,
it would certainly make sense

778
00:44:19,917 --> 00:44:21,960
of him destroying his papers.

779
00:44:22,085 --> 00:44:23,629
And God knows
as a failed playwright,

780
00:44:23,754 --> 00:44:25,964
Cree must've grown sick
of watching his famous wife

781
00:44:26,089 --> 00:44:28,634
earn London's attention.

782
00:44:28,759 --> 00:44:29,968
Do you fancy another?

783
00:44:30,093 --> 00:44:32,805
Trying to get me drunk?

784
00:44:32,930 --> 00:44:34,598
A pint, please.

785
00:44:36,934 --> 00:44:41,188
It was a joke.
Didn't mean nothing.

786
00:44:41,313 --> 00:44:43,816
I didn't mean to offend.

787
00:44:45,984 --> 00:44:48,320
I'm...

788
00:44:48,445 --> 00:44:49,947
on your side.

789
00:44:57,454 --> 00:44:59,998
It's not the Golem
haunting you, is it?

790
00:45:00,123 --> 00:45:01,166
It's her.

791
00:45:01,291 --> 00:45:03,502
She's going to hang, Flood.

792
00:45:03,627 --> 00:45:07,506
We have to rule out
the other suspects.

793
00:45:07,631 --> 00:45:10,676
Well, I may have found
an eyewitness in Limehouse, sir.

794
00:45:10,801 --> 00:45:12,719
Scaoil liom! Scaoil liom!

795
00:45:14,304 --> 00:45:16,056
You're not in any trouble.

796
00:45:16,181 --> 00:45:18,517
I'm taking you to someone
who can translate.

797
00:45:18,642 --> 00:45:19,643
Understand?

798
00:45:22,855 --> 00:45:25,357
This is... This is Sister Mary.

799
00:45:25,482 --> 00:45:27,860
Tá mo mháthair tar
éis mé a dhíol cheana.

800
00:45:27,985 --> 00:45:30,863
Tá fear do m'fhuadach
Ar mo lá breithe.

801
00:45:30,988 --> 00:45:33,198
The child says
she's not for sale.

802
00:45:33,323 --> 00:45:35,701
Her mum's got a fella
taking her on her next birthday.

803
00:45:35,826 --> 00:45:37,703
No, no, please.

804
00:45:37,828 --> 00:45:41,206
Tell her my colleague
showed her some photographs,

805
00:45:41,331 --> 00:45:42,875
suspects in a crime.

806
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,043
She seemed to recognize
one of them.

807
00:45:45,168 --> 00:45:48,005
We need to know where
and when she saw him.

808
00:45:49,673 --> 00:45:53,218
Sir, this is where
Solomon Weil lived!

809
00:45:53,343 --> 00:45:55,095
The scholar, the third victim.

810
00:45:55,220 --> 00:45:58,056
- Which house number did he...
- Number 4.

811
00:46:04,688 --> 00:46:06,023
This man?

812
00:46:09,026 --> 00:46:10,736
Families starve in the streets.

813
00:46:10,861 --> 00:46:13,739
Women are used up
and thrown away, then you...

814
00:46:13,864 --> 00:46:16,909
you persecute one
who fights for the people.

815
00:46:17,034 --> 00:46:20,412
You're not fit to clean the
boots of a man like Karl Marx.

816
00:46:28,420 --> 00:46:30,589
So...

817
00:46:30,714 --> 00:46:32,314
London declares that
the Jew was murdered

818
00:46:32,382 --> 00:46:34,259
by a Jewish monster?

819
00:46:34,384 --> 00:46:37,763
And so absolves itself
of all responsibility.

820
00:46:37,888 --> 00:46:41,266
Make no mistake, gentlemen,
it is not Solomon Weil

821
00:46:41,391 --> 00:46:43,268
who's mutilated
and murdered here.

822
00:46:43,393 --> 00:46:44,811
It is the Jew.

823
00:46:44,937 --> 00:46:47,606
None of the Golem's
other victims were Hebrews, sir.

824
00:46:47,731 --> 00:46:49,608
But do you not see?

825
00:46:49,733 --> 00:46:53,320
This murderer strikes at
the very symbols of the city...

826
00:46:53,445 --> 00:46:55,781
the Jew, the whore.

827
00:46:55,906 --> 00:46:57,950
They are
the sacrificial tributes

828
00:46:58,075 --> 00:47:01,453
in this labyrinth of London.

829
00:47:01,578 --> 00:47:05,749
And so of course must
be ritually butchered.

830
00:47:14,591 --> 00:47:16,259
What is it that
you wish me to write?

831
00:47:18,929 --> 00:47:21,848
"The Morning Herald...

832
00:47:21,974 --> 00:47:26,812
had declined
to review my debut."

833
00:47:26,937 --> 00:47:30,482
All that work for nothing.

834
00:47:30,607 --> 00:47:33,485
I resolved that this time
I'd put on a show

835
00:47:33,610 --> 00:47:36,613
that everyone would notice.

836
00:47:37,781 --> 00:47:42,828
A fine opening act
of the crowd-pleasing sort.

837
00:48:12,149 --> 00:48:15,027
And I went
on to create a spectacle

838
00:48:15,152 --> 00:48:18,530
that no beholder
would ever forget.

839
00:48:24,828 --> 00:48:28,040
"It was all too easy
to kill a whore.

840
00:48:28,165 --> 00:48:31,251
Tonight I would return
to kill the Jew."

841
00:48:31,376 --> 00:48:33,086
This is absurd.

842
00:48:33,211 --> 00:48:35,255
You didn't do this.

843
00:48:35,380 --> 00:48:37,049
Of course I didn't.

844
00:48:40,343 --> 00:48:42,763
Would you agree
with the defendant

845
00:48:42,888 --> 00:48:45,223
that in the weeks
before his death,

846
00:48:45,348 --> 00:48:49,227
Mr. Cree had seemed "morbid"?

847
00:48:49,352 --> 00:48:50,937
No, sir.

848
00:48:51,063 --> 00:48:53,732
He was in good spirits.

849
00:48:53,857 --> 00:48:56,234
And how would you
describe relations

850
00:48:56,359 --> 00:48:59,237
between Mr. Cree and his wife?

851
00:48:59,362 --> 00:49:00,906
Not especially good, sir.

852
00:49:01,031 --> 00:49:03,575
They saw very little
of each other.

853
00:49:03,700 --> 00:49:08,622
And yet Mrs. Cree insisted on
preparing him a nightly draft?

854
00:49:08,747 --> 00:49:10,415
That is correct, sir.

855
00:49:10,540 --> 00:49:13,919
And did you hear
Mr. Cree express suspicions

856
00:49:14,044 --> 00:49:17,756
that she might have tainted
this draft with something?

857
00:49:17,881 --> 00:49:19,925
Not quite.

858
00:49:20,050 --> 00:49:22,761
Though just before his death,

859
00:49:22,886 --> 00:49:25,263
I overheard them in dispute.

860
00:49:25,388 --> 00:49:26,765
I heard Mr. Cree say,

861
00:49:26,890 --> 00:49:29,601
"You devil.
You have done this."

862
00:49:35,565 --> 00:49:40,112
She may as well have placed the
noose around my neck herself.

863
00:49:40,237 --> 00:49:43,281
You must make it plain to the
jury that there was bad blood

864
00:49:43,406 --> 00:49:44,950
between the two of you.

865
00:49:45,075 --> 00:49:46,785
Romantic jealousy.

866
00:49:46,910 --> 00:49:48,787
I never stood between them.

867
00:49:48,912 --> 00:49:51,790
I'm sure my feelings on intimacy
are plain to you by now.

868
00:49:51,915 --> 00:49:53,792
John was free to court
Aveline if he wanted to.

869
00:49:53,917 --> 00:49:56,461
But he had his heart set on you.

870
00:49:56,586 --> 00:49:58,797
I did nothing to encourage it.

871
00:49:58,922 --> 00:50:02,968
My stage career had taken off.
I rarely saw him.

872
00:50:03,093 --> 00:50:05,303
And then...

873
00:50:05,428 --> 00:50:08,140
out of the blue,
he invited me for supper.

874
00:50:08,265 --> 00:50:10,517
Your new show's tremendous.

875
00:50:10,642 --> 00:50:12,245
We feel awful intruding.

876
00:50:12,269 --> 00:50:13,478
We simply adore you.

877
00:50:13,603 --> 00:50:15,647
Thank you.

878
00:50:15,772 --> 00:50:17,315
Thank you.
I'll treasure this.

879
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:19,484
Thank you very much.

880
00:50:19,609 --> 00:50:22,821
- I can't believe it.
- What a surprise!

881
00:50:22,946 --> 00:50:26,658
As I was saying, I have reached
the end of the first act

882
00:50:26,783 --> 00:50:28,326
of "Misery Junction."

883
00:50:28,451 --> 00:50:31,163
But I can't quite decide
what to do with my heroine next,

884
00:50:31,288 --> 00:50:34,666
and, um, I thought
you might advise me.

885
00:50:34,791 --> 00:50:36,001
I'm flattered.

886
00:50:36,126 --> 00:50:37,566
The heroine's name
is Katherine Dove.

887
00:50:37,627 --> 00:50:39,337
- Hmm.
- When I began,

888
00:50:39,462 --> 00:50:40,839
I had her in the workhouses,

889
00:50:40,964 --> 00:50:45,343
but now I have her
sewing sailcloth on the docks.

890
00:50:45,468 --> 00:50:47,345
My mother died when I was young.

891
00:50:47,470 --> 00:50:49,014
Her kidneys.

892
00:50:49,139 --> 00:50:50,515
It was so fast.

893
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:52,809
Orphaned and alone at 14.

894
00:50:54,019 --> 00:50:56,229
Is Katherine Dove an orphan?

895
00:50:56,354 --> 00:50:58,523
She could be.

896
00:50:58,648 --> 00:51:00,126
But you've still not told me
what to do with her

897
00:51:00,150 --> 00:51:01,401
by the end of the first act.

898
00:51:01,526 --> 00:51:02,694
What's your dilemma?

899
00:51:02,819 --> 00:51:04,029
At the moment,

900
00:51:04,154 --> 00:51:06,907
she's very close
to starvation and ruin,

901
00:51:07,032 --> 00:51:10,035
and I'm wondering
if I should rescue her.

902
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:11,870
Yes.

903
00:51:11,995 --> 00:51:14,206
Have her become successful.

904
00:51:14,331 --> 00:51:16,416
Loved by her audiences.

905
00:51:16,541 --> 00:51:18,376
But she's very much alone.

906
00:51:18,501 --> 00:51:20,101
Living in theatrical digs,
hand to mouth.

907
00:51:20,170 --> 00:51:21,546
It's a life of degradation.

908
00:51:21,671 --> 00:51:23,048
Come on.

909
00:51:23,173 --> 00:51:25,383
People love to see degradation
upon the stage.

910
00:51:25,508 --> 00:51:26,885
It's what they pay for.

911
00:51:27,010 --> 00:51:28,887
Yeah, but they expect
to see a happy ending.

912
00:51:29,012 --> 00:51:31,556
And Katherine deserves
a protector.

913
00:51:31,681 --> 00:51:32,933
She does.

914
00:51:33,058 --> 00:51:35,435
Her manager, perhaps.

915
00:51:35,560 --> 00:51:37,395
Someone kindly, like Uncle.

916
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:39,440
No, an elderly character,
the audience would know

917
00:51:39,522 --> 00:51:42,067
he wouldn't live
to see her into old age.

918
00:51:42,192 --> 00:51:43,568
A friend, then.

919
00:51:43,693 --> 00:51:44,945
A comic, maybe.

920
00:51:45,070 --> 00:51:48,240
I would like to
give her a suitor.

921
00:51:48,365 --> 00:51:51,117
Someone who cares fiercely
for her well-being.

922
00:51:51,243 --> 00:51:53,578
A white knight.

923
00:51:53,703 --> 00:51:57,249
What do you think?

924
00:51:57,374 --> 00:51:59,417
I think Katherine Dove can
look out for herself.

925
00:52:03,213 --> 00:52:04,756
In the bowl.

926
00:52:04,881 --> 00:52:05,924
Yes, there we go.

927
00:52:06,049 --> 00:52:07,049
Get it out.

928
00:52:07,092 --> 00:52:08,969
That's it.

929
00:52:09,094 --> 00:52:10,762
Gin.

930
00:52:10,887 --> 00:52:13,098
Down here.

931
00:52:13,223 --> 00:52:16,601
There we go.

932
00:52:16,726 --> 00:52:18,144
God.

933
00:52:18,270 --> 00:52:20,730
I think I put my back out
carrying her up the stairs.

934
00:52:23,900 --> 00:52:27,153
I see you decided to dress
as a woman this evening.

935
00:52:27,279 --> 00:52:29,322
Can't wear a costume
out to supper, can I?

936
00:52:29,447 --> 00:52:30,657
Wouldn't be the first time.

937
00:52:39,791 --> 00:52:42,002
Be careful of that one, Lizzie.

938
00:52:42,127 --> 00:52:43,670
Don't lead him up
the garden path

939
00:52:43,795 --> 00:52:46,798
unless you're prepared
to be dragged indoors.

940
00:52:46,923 --> 00:52:48,842
He offered me the lead
in "Misery Junction."

941
00:52:48,967 --> 00:52:51,469
He'll expect something
in return.

942
00:53:00,145 --> 00:53:03,481
You don't need him, Lizzie.

943
00:53:03,606 --> 00:53:05,275
You did all this on your own.

944
00:53:08,320 --> 00:53:11,656
I could do more.

945
00:53:11,781 --> 00:53:14,993
Could be a real actress.

946
00:53:15,118 --> 00:53:18,872
Show the world what people
like us are really capable of.

947
00:53:21,291 --> 00:53:25,545
I just need a chance.

948
00:53:25,670 --> 00:53:29,341
Here we sit, the two most
famous faces on the stage,

949
00:53:29,466 --> 00:53:33,219
and you suggest the world
conspires to oppress us.

950
00:53:33,345 --> 00:53:35,055
Remember that book you lent me?

951
00:53:35,180 --> 00:53:37,682
Pope?
In the temple of fame,

952
00:53:37,807 --> 00:53:41,353
some people's names are carved
in stone and others in ice.

953
00:53:41,478 --> 00:53:44,356
We're clowns, Dan.

954
00:53:44,481 --> 00:53:46,983
We'll be forgotten.

955
00:53:49,486 --> 00:53:52,072
If you think a man like John
Cree is going to change that,

956
00:53:52,197 --> 00:53:54,240
I don't have
the breath to argue.

957
00:53:56,993 --> 00:53:59,204
And you know she's got
a soft spot for him.

958
00:53:59,329 --> 00:54:02,707
And whatever her faults,
she's family.

959
00:54:02,832 --> 00:54:04,876
And we look out
for each other, don't we?

960
00:54:12,217 --> 00:54:13,593
The big finale is the hanging.

961
00:54:13,718 --> 00:54:14,886
We've a life-size gallows.

962
00:54:15,011 --> 00:54:16,554
I'll wear this harness,
concealed,

963
00:54:16,679 --> 00:54:17,990
and then drop right
through the trap just there.

964
00:54:18,014 --> 00:54:19,265
Looks just like a real hanging.

965
00:54:19,391 --> 00:54:20,993
Lizzie, you sure it's safe,
this contraption?

966
00:54:21,017 --> 00:54:22,161
You're not wearing
a real noose, are you?

967
00:54:22,185 --> 00:54:23,436
Oh, the noose is real,

968
00:54:23,561 --> 00:54:26,564
but the fall is broken
by the harness.

969
00:54:26,689 --> 00:54:28,108
Where's Lizzie?

970
00:54:28,233 --> 00:54:30,944
Up above giving John Cree
an interview for The Era.

971
00:54:31,069 --> 00:54:32,570
Is that what they call it?

972
00:54:32,695 --> 00:54:33,975
I'll go and tell her
to hurry up.

973
00:54:34,072 --> 00:54:35,907
The play's a shocker,
but a spoof shocker,

974
00:54:36,032 --> 00:54:37,792
the way only our marvelous
company can do it.

975
00:54:37,867 --> 00:54:39,911
Dan wrote it.
It's based on the, uh,

976
00:54:40,036 --> 00:54:41,913
the Ratcliffe Highway murders
of 1811.

977
00:54:42,038 --> 00:54:43,248
- John Williams.
- Pardon?

978
00:54:43,373 --> 00:54:44,791
The killer's name
was John Williams.

979
00:54:44,916 --> 00:54:46,418
Oh, quite.
But much of it is fiction.

980
00:54:46,543 --> 00:54:48,086
It's all great fun,
and terribly gory.

981
00:54:48,211 --> 00:54:49,730
Oh, you must put that
in for your readers.

982
00:54:49,754 --> 00:54:51,923
Dan says everybody thrills
to gore these days.

983
00:54:52,048 --> 00:54:53,800
Let's have you finished, John.

984
00:54:53,925 --> 00:54:56,428
She's not even ready and
she's on stage in 10 minutes.

985
00:54:56,553 --> 00:54:58,930
We can't have the star late
for the first performance.

986
00:54:59,055 --> 00:55:00,815
Dan's still the star.
Always will be.

987
00:55:00,932 --> 00:55:03,601
Thought I felt my ears burning.

988
00:55:03,726 --> 00:55:06,271
- Did anyone check the safety?
- Of course.

989
00:55:06,396 --> 00:55:08,249
Wouldn't let anything happen
to our Lizzie, would we?

990
00:55:08,273 --> 00:55:09,607
- How's the crowd?
- Excellent.

991
00:55:09,732 --> 00:55:10,942
Great number of Jews.

992
00:55:11,067 --> 00:55:13,278
I believe it's one
of their holidays.

993
00:55:13,403 --> 00:55:15,113
You should speak
to them in Yiddish.

994
00:55:15,238 --> 00:55:16,614
They will love it.

995
00:55:16,739 --> 00:55:18,283
Wish them...

996
00:55:18,408 --> 00:55:20,952
"meesa meschina."

997
00:55:25,748 --> 00:55:28,460
Welcome, brave hearts,
to an evening of horror.

998
00:55:34,924 --> 00:55:36,634
Our play's about to begin,

999
00:55:36,759 --> 00:55:39,804
but first, ladies and gentlemen,

1000
00:55:39,929 --> 00:55:43,975
and those not unconnected with a
certain historical chosen race,

1001
00:55:44,100 --> 00:55:47,479
may I wish you all
from the bottom of my heart

1002
00:55:47,604 --> 00:55:50,523
meesa meschina.

1003
00:55:50,648 --> 00:55:51,983
That is mashugana!

1004
00:55:59,282 --> 00:56:00,658
What did you say that for?!

1005
00:56:00,783 --> 00:56:01,993
What happened?

1006
00:56:02,118 --> 00:56:03,596
Lizzie wished the Jews
a sudden death!

1007
00:56:03,620 --> 00:56:05,163
Oh!

1008
00:56:05,288 --> 00:56:08,166
Here we are again!

1009
00:56:12,629 --> 00:56:14,339
It was only a lark, Lizzie.

1010
00:56:21,471 --> 00:56:23,890
I came back at once to see
if you were all right.

1011
00:56:49,999 --> 00:56:52,710
And after that,
you began courting?

1012
00:56:52,835 --> 00:56:55,547
After a fashion.

1013
00:56:55,672 --> 00:56:57,312
I could never love
John enough to give him

1014
00:56:57,382 --> 00:56:59,884
what he really wanted.

1015
00:57:00,009 --> 00:57:03,721
But you grew to love him?

1016
00:57:03,846 --> 00:57:06,891
I wanted to be in his play.

1017
00:57:07,016 --> 00:57:10,436
He wanted the gratification
of plucking a poor needy girl

1018
00:57:10,562 --> 00:57:12,522
from misery and saving her.

1019
00:57:14,857 --> 00:57:17,777
We used one another equally.

1020
00:57:17,902 --> 00:57:21,739
Perhaps that's the best that
can be said of any coupling.

1021
00:57:21,864 --> 00:57:24,742
That's a very dim view.

1022
00:57:24,867 --> 00:57:28,037
If you seek a dim view,
be sure to ask a comedian.

1023
00:57:38,548 --> 00:57:41,593
Alice Stanton's dress
finally showed up.

1024
00:57:41,718 --> 00:57:44,887
Improperly archived,
like everything else here.

1025
00:57:48,391 --> 00:57:49,726
Been at the jail again?

1026
00:57:53,396 --> 00:57:55,607
Anything more on Cree?

1027
00:57:55,732 --> 00:57:57,609
Only that he was
a manipulative ass

1028
00:57:57,734 --> 00:57:59,211
who fancied himself
as a white knight.

1029
00:57:59,235 --> 00:58:01,112
I meant as relating to our case.

1030
00:58:01,237 --> 00:58:04,157
The Golem. Remember him?

1031
00:58:04,282 --> 00:58:05,842
Cree knew of the murderer
John Williams.

1032
00:58:05,908 --> 00:58:07,452
Yet, apparently,
so did Dan Leno.

1033
00:58:07,577 --> 00:58:09,263
In fact, Leno wrote
a whole play about the fellow.

1034
00:58:09,287 --> 00:58:11,789
Golem suspect who is alive.
That would be bad news.

1035
00:58:11,914 --> 00:58:14,125
- For his next victim, certainly.
- And for you.

1036
00:58:14,250 --> 00:58:15,728
Or do you no longer care
what becomes of your career?

1037
00:58:15,752 --> 00:58:17,337
I've a job to do
and I'm doing it.

1038
00:58:17,462 --> 00:58:19,797
- And which job would that be?
- Watch your tongue, Flood.

1039
00:58:19,922 --> 00:58:21,522
Do I need to remind you
of your position?

1040
00:58:21,591 --> 00:58:23,635
That may be helpful.

1041
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:25,637
Because there are times
when I'm confused

1042
00:58:25,762 --> 00:58:27,639
as to whether we're here
to find the Golem

1043
00:58:27,764 --> 00:58:28,973
or to save Elizabeth.

1044
00:58:29,098 --> 00:58:31,684
Perhaps we'll do both!

1045
00:58:31,809 --> 00:58:34,312
Who knows...

1046
00:58:37,815 --> 00:58:39,984
Dear God, how many pockets
did Leno need?

1047
00:58:40,109 --> 00:58:41,694
He tosses things into the crowd.

1048
00:58:41,819 --> 00:58:43,696
Sweeties. Flowers.
Undergarments.

1049
00:58:43,821 --> 00:58:45,031
Sounds hilarious.

1050
00:58:45,156 --> 00:58:46,658
Didn't Roberts
empty the contents?

1051
00:58:46,783 --> 00:58:47,992
The coroner's office did it.

1052
00:58:48,117 --> 00:58:49,452
Why?
Did they miss something?

1053
00:59:02,799 --> 00:59:04,550
8 Gower Place?

1054
00:59:04,676 --> 00:59:05,843
Why do I know that?

1055
00:59:05,968 --> 00:59:08,054
Perhaps because
we're due a visit.

1056
00:59:08,179 --> 00:59:10,139
It's George Gissing's address.

1057
00:59:11,683 --> 00:59:13,523
His wife gave him
an alibi for the night

1058
00:59:13,643 --> 00:59:15,186
of the Ratcliffe Highway
murders,

1059
00:59:15,311 --> 00:59:17,730
but she seemed
fond of her drink.

1060
00:59:25,321 --> 00:59:27,907
We need to talk to Mr. Gissing,
madam.

1061
00:59:28,032 --> 00:59:30,201
George isn't here.
He just left.

1062
00:59:30,326 --> 00:59:31,703
Do you know where he was going?

1063
00:59:31,828 --> 00:59:33,996
Limehouse, perhaps?

1064
00:59:56,853 --> 00:59:58,104
Not yet.

1065
00:59:58,229 --> 01:00:00,064
I'm interested to see
where he goes.

1066
01:00:00,189 --> 01:00:03,735
What business a scholar has
in the streets of Limehouse.

1067
01:00:43,065 --> 01:00:45,109
Madam, we're from Scotland Yard.

1068
01:00:45,234 --> 01:00:46,253
We're just a pharmacy.

1069
01:00:46,277 --> 01:00:48,613
You go away!
Check my record!

1070
01:00:51,908 --> 01:00:53,785
Our business
is with Mr. Gissing,

1071
01:00:53,910 --> 01:00:55,995
the man who just entered,
not you.

1072
01:00:59,248 --> 01:01:00,833
Good customer.

1073
01:01:00,958 --> 01:01:02,752
He keep his work here.

1074
01:01:05,963 --> 01:01:07,006
Always working.

1075
01:01:07,131 --> 01:01:08,966
Writing.

1076
01:01:11,761 --> 01:01:13,638
Mr. Gissing,
I'm Detective Inspector Kildare

1077
01:01:13,763 --> 01:01:15,640
of Scotland Yard.

1078
01:01:15,765 --> 01:01:17,642
Perhaps you could explain
how this came to be

1079
01:01:17,767 --> 01:01:20,102
in the possession
of a murdered woman.

1080
01:01:22,271 --> 01:01:24,649
I'm afraid you'll find
my address in the pockets

1081
01:01:24,774 --> 01:01:27,151
of a great many women
in this area, sir.

1082
01:01:27,276 --> 01:01:30,196
My wife, Nell, is in the habit
of... going missing.

1083
01:01:30,321 --> 01:01:31,489
I give my address so that

1084
01:01:31,614 --> 01:01:33,825
they may contact me
if they see her.

1085
01:01:33,950 --> 01:01:37,537
Let us just say my wife
used to ply the same trade.

1086
01:01:37,662 --> 01:01:40,498
You don't seem in the least
bit surprised.

1087
01:01:40,623 --> 01:01:41,833
By what?

1088
01:01:41,958 --> 01:01:44,168
That a gentleman like me,
a-a scholar,

1089
01:01:44,293 --> 01:01:45,545
should have wed a fallen woman.

1090
01:01:45,670 --> 01:01:47,672
Why would anyone be surprised?

1091
01:01:47,797 --> 01:01:50,049
The world is full of men
like you, Mr. Gissing.

1092
01:01:50,174 --> 01:01:51,676
I beg your pardon?

1093
01:01:51,801 --> 01:01:54,053
Men who feign generosity
when what they really seek

1094
01:01:54,178 --> 01:01:55,388
is congratulation.

1095
01:01:55,513 --> 01:01:57,682
Men who play God
by saving lives.

1096
01:01:57,807 --> 01:02:00,184
Is it really so different,
I wonder,

1097
01:02:00,309 --> 01:02:01,853
from playing God by taking them?

1098
01:02:01,978 --> 01:02:03,896
I am not a murderer, sir.

1099
01:02:04,021 --> 01:02:07,692
Then perhaps you will
write the words that I dictate?

1100
01:02:07,817 --> 01:02:10,027
Let's get this thing done.

1101
01:02:10,152 --> 01:02:14,907
"September 10, 1880."

1102
01:02:15,032 --> 01:02:17,076
My public debut...

1103
01:02:17,201 --> 01:02:19,912
"had garnered rave reviews."

1104
01:02:20,037 --> 01:02:21,849
I could scarcely
wait to begin work

1105
01:02:21,873 --> 01:02:23,875
on my next creation,

1106
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,586
but there was time
to pass before dark,

1107
01:02:26,711 --> 01:02:30,548
so I paid a visit
to the Ratcliffe Highway shop.

1108
01:02:37,179 --> 01:02:40,266
I bought some cufflinks
from the owner's wife.

1109
01:02:40,391 --> 01:02:42,560
I could tell that
when the time came,

1110
01:02:42,685 --> 01:02:45,396
she would make a fine player
in my magnum opus.

1111
01:03:20,389 --> 01:03:23,100
You're not
the Jew from the library.

1112
01:03:23,225 --> 01:03:24,769
Ah, well.

1113
01:03:24,894 --> 01:03:27,271
No matter.

1114
01:03:27,396 --> 01:03:29,982
Who are you?
What do you want?

1115
01:03:30,107 --> 01:03:32,276
I have come to discourse
with you.

1116
01:03:32,401 --> 01:03:35,404
About death
and everlasting life.

1117
01:03:37,073 --> 01:03:38,616
Herein...

1118
01:03:38,741 --> 01:03:40,785
lies the secret.

1119
01:03:50,127 --> 01:03:53,172
It was here that
I read of the mythical Golem,

1120
01:03:53,297 --> 01:03:56,968
a homunculus of clay
given life by man.

1121
01:03:57,093 --> 01:03:59,011
How could any Londoner
fail to delight

1122
01:03:59,136 --> 01:04:01,013
in this piece of theater?

1123
01:04:01,138 --> 01:04:03,349
I could even see myself
appearing before

1124
01:04:03,474 --> 01:04:05,810
the next unfortunate
with mallet in hand

1125
01:04:05,935 --> 01:04:09,689
exclaiming,
"Here we are again."

1126
01:04:13,275 --> 01:04:14,694
May I go now?

1127
01:04:14,819 --> 01:04:16,320
What?

1128
01:04:16,445 --> 01:04:18,823
Oh, yes, I'm sorry.

1129
01:04:18,948 --> 01:04:20,491
Why would you be
thinking of me still?

1130
01:04:20,616 --> 01:04:22,660
My hand doesn't match at all.
You know I'm innocent.

1131
01:04:22,785 --> 01:04:24,662
I know.
I was reading what you wrote.

1132
01:04:24,787 --> 01:04:26,330
You were in my mind.
I'm sorry.

1133
01:04:26,455 --> 01:04:27,999
Something I missed.

1134
01:04:28,124 --> 01:04:29,667
Oh, I see. What is it?

1135
01:04:29,792 --> 01:04:32,837
A line from the journal.

1136
01:04:32,962 --> 01:04:38,384
"I bought some cufflinks
from the owner's wife."

1137
01:04:38,509 --> 01:04:40,720
On September the 10th,

1138
01:04:40,845 --> 01:04:44,015
the Golem made a purchase
from the Ratcliffe Highway shop.

1139
01:05:06,328 --> 01:05:08,873
A new production of "Bluebeard"

1140
01:05:08,998 --> 01:05:10,041
opens this weekend,

1141
01:05:10,166 --> 01:05:11,876
and all of London longs

1142
01:05:12,001 --> 01:05:16,547
to see the great Dan Leno
performing it.

1143
01:05:16,672 --> 01:05:22,595
But I know they yearn
for more potent excitements.

1144
01:05:22,720 --> 01:05:28,768
This is pantomime
in its purest form.

1145
01:05:28,893 --> 01:05:30,895
I could even see myself
appearing

1146
01:05:31,020 --> 01:05:32,563
before the next unfortunate,

1147
01:05:32,688 --> 01:05:35,232
with a mallet in my hand,
exclaiming,

1148
01:05:35,357 --> 01:05:38,235
"Here we are again!"

1149
01:05:45,367 --> 01:05:49,413
What strange coincidence
and delight to discover,

1150
01:05:49,538 --> 01:05:51,582
on the streets of Limehouse,

1151
01:05:51,707 --> 01:05:56,754
a whore wearing a costume
I remembered well.

1152
01:05:56,879 --> 01:06:00,424
She was a player
waiting for a role.

1153
01:06:00,549 --> 01:06:03,594
Of course, I obliged her.

1154
01:06:03,719 --> 01:06:07,807
The public yearned
for the next installment.

1155
01:06:07,932 --> 01:06:11,268
And one should never
keep an audience waiting.

1156
01:06:14,897 --> 01:06:17,942
We need to forget about
Cree and concentrate on Leno.

1157
01:06:18,067 --> 01:06:21,987
The Golem even imagined himself
saying, "Here we are again."

1158
01:06:22,113 --> 01:06:25,616
I know, but apparently everyone
knows Leno's catch-phrase.

1159
01:06:25,741 --> 01:06:27,451
There's Alice Stanton's dress

1160
01:06:27,576 --> 01:06:29,620
and the fact
he knew Mr. Gerrard.

1161
01:06:29,745 --> 01:06:31,288
We're all part
of London's tapestry.

1162
01:06:31,413 --> 01:06:34,583
Sometimes threads get crossed.

1163
01:06:36,418 --> 01:06:38,587
Good Lord!

1164
01:06:42,258 --> 01:06:44,301
We should buy tickets.

1165
01:06:44,426 --> 01:06:45,845
I'd be intrigued
to see how it ends.

1166
01:06:45,970 --> 01:06:47,471
I could recommend many
better shows.

1167
01:06:47,596 --> 01:06:49,181
I was making a joke, Flood.

1168
01:06:49,306 --> 01:06:51,183
As was I.

1169
01:06:51,308 --> 01:06:52,977
Obviously.

1170
01:06:53,102 --> 01:06:54,979
Who'd wish to see something
in such poor taste?

1171
01:06:55,104 --> 01:06:57,815
Apparently London's appetite
for horror knows no bounds.

1172
01:06:57,940 --> 01:07:00,359
Our Golem was quite
correct about that.

1173
01:07:00,484 --> 01:07:02,987
Oh, Bluey, please!

1174
01:07:03,112 --> 01:07:04,488
Have mercy!

1175
01:07:04,613 --> 01:07:07,491
It's been days since I've eaten!

1176
01:07:18,460 --> 01:07:22,173
Oh, you are a kind man, Bluey!

1177
01:07:22,298 --> 01:07:25,384
I shall never have it said
you're not good to me.

1178
01:07:26,802 --> 01:07:29,513
I thought I might expire
from starvation.

1179
01:07:43,485 --> 01:07:45,863
What on earth
are you doing, dear?!

1180
01:07:45,988 --> 01:07:47,007
I'm taking my medical treatment.

1181
01:07:47,031 --> 01:07:48,741
You're treatment?!

1182
01:07:48,866 --> 01:07:53,204
The doctor told me to take a
daily walk on an empty stomach.

1183
01:07:58,834 --> 01:08:02,546
Ah. Brought the receipt, as
you requested in your telegram.

1184
01:08:04,715 --> 01:08:08,761
As you will see,
I did not buy cufflinks.

1185
01:08:08,886 --> 01:08:10,429
A ladies' hat.

1186
01:08:10,554 --> 01:08:14,058
I often shopped for stagewear
at Gerrard's little shop.

1187
01:08:14,183 --> 01:08:15,434
God rest him.

1188
01:08:15,559 --> 01:08:17,061
I knew him well.

1189
01:08:17,186 --> 01:08:19,897
Oh, now, you mentioned needing
a sample of my hand.

1190
01:08:20,022 --> 01:08:22,733
Well, I-I-I brought a pile
of my old papers.

1191
01:08:22,858 --> 01:08:24,735
Please, take as many
as you see fit.

1192
01:08:24,860 --> 01:08:26,946
I'm afraid I'll need you
to produce a sample

1193
01:08:27,071 --> 01:08:30,950
in my presence, Mr. Leno.

1194
01:08:31,075 --> 01:08:32,743
Then you will permit me
to pay you a visit

1195
01:08:32,868 --> 01:08:34,954
at Scotland Yard
tomorrow afternoon?

1196
01:08:35,079 --> 01:08:38,290
Only,
I have supper arrangements.

1197
01:08:38,415 --> 01:08:41,585
And I've still to be rid
of all of this.

1198
01:08:41,710 --> 01:08:43,587
If you'll... excuse me?

1199
01:08:43,712 --> 01:08:45,089
Perhaps we could continue

1200
01:08:45,214 --> 01:08:47,967
to talk while you're...

1201
01:08:48,092 --> 01:08:53,597
I've some questions I'd like to
ask you about John Cree.

1202
01:08:53,722 --> 01:08:55,307
Then I shall try to answer them.

1203
01:08:55,432 --> 01:08:57,434
Though one should never
speak ill of the dead.

1204
01:08:57,559 --> 01:08:58,769
You didn't care for the man?

1205
01:08:58,894 --> 01:09:00,271
I was friendly with his wife.

1206
01:09:00,396 --> 01:09:01,772
He made her unhappy.

1207
01:09:01,897 --> 01:09:04,149
You may extrapolate the rest.

1208
01:09:04,275 --> 01:09:06,777
When did you last see him?

1209
01:09:06,902 --> 01:09:09,822
First night of his play,
"Misery Junction,"

1210
01:09:09,947 --> 01:09:11,782
which also happened
to be the closing night.

1211
01:09:11,907 --> 01:09:14,451
I know.
Did you see him afterwards?

1212
01:09:14,576 --> 01:09:15,619
Of course.

1213
01:09:15,744 --> 01:09:18,330
This is my theatre.

1214
01:09:18,455 --> 01:09:22,793
I took over managing it
last year when...

1215
01:09:22,918 --> 01:09:26,130
Uncle joined the great pantomime
in the sky.

1216
01:09:26,255 --> 01:09:28,507
The performance was here?

1217
01:09:28,632 --> 01:09:30,301
For Lizzie's sake.

1218
01:09:30,426 --> 01:09:32,970
Whatever became
of our friendship,

1219
01:09:33,095 --> 01:09:36,807
we'll always be family.

1220
01:09:36,932 --> 01:09:38,475
Is John Cree a suspect?

1221
01:09:38,600 --> 01:09:39,977
I'm not at liberty to say.

1222
01:09:40,102 --> 01:09:41,812
A posthumous suspect.

1223
01:09:41,937 --> 01:09:43,647
What will you do,
dig him up for the trial?

1224
01:09:43,772 --> 01:09:45,250
Do you know why Lizzie might be

1225
01:09:45,274 --> 01:09:48,819
reluctant to voice
any suspicions?

1226
01:09:48,944 --> 01:09:51,697
You think she's protecting him?

1227
01:09:51,822 --> 01:09:54,158
Now, that's a novel slant.

1228
01:09:54,283 --> 01:09:57,995
Most people believe
she poisoned him.

1229
01:09:58,120 --> 01:10:00,622
Do you?

1230
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:07,671
Either way, that man was
the author of his own demise.

1231
01:10:07,796 --> 01:10:10,007
He practically destroyed her.

1232
01:10:10,132 --> 01:10:11,452
Insisting she give up
the stage...

1233
01:10:11,508 --> 01:10:14,678
I mean, he may as well
have ended her life.

1234
01:10:14,803 --> 01:10:18,182
Do you think he
was capable of ending a life?

1235
01:10:18,307 --> 01:10:21,727
Literally, I mean.

1236
01:10:21,852 --> 01:10:25,856
Who knows what any man
is capable of?

1237
01:10:25,981 --> 01:10:28,525
We all wear pantomime masks,

1238
01:10:28,650 --> 01:10:30,027
do we not?

1239
01:10:32,321 --> 01:10:34,698
I'm sorry,
I really must dress now.

1240
01:10:34,823 --> 01:10:37,493
First, tell me
about Little Victor.

1241
01:10:39,703 --> 01:10:42,373
If the injustices of the past
interest you,

1242
01:10:42,498 --> 01:10:45,876
you'd do better to look into
the demise of Tommy Farr.

1243
01:10:46,001 --> 01:10:47,711
Uncle?

1244
01:10:47,836 --> 01:10:50,047
Uncle.

1245
01:11:00,516 --> 01:11:01,934
They said the jury expects

1246
01:11:02,059 --> 01:11:03,727
to reach a verdict
this afternoon.

1247
01:11:03,852 --> 01:11:05,729
I know. Lizzie...

1248
01:11:05,854 --> 01:11:06,897
It would seem the press

1249
01:11:07,022 --> 01:11:09,525
have reached theirs already.

1250
01:11:11,693 --> 01:11:13,404
Lizzie, I spoke with Dan.

1251
01:11:13,529 --> 01:11:17,408
He urged me to look
into Uncle's death.

1252
01:11:17,533 --> 01:11:18,843
If you wanted to know
about Uncle,

1253
01:11:18,867 --> 01:11:20,911
you should simply have asked.

1254
01:11:21,036 --> 01:11:23,622
Come into the parlor.

1255
01:11:23,747 --> 01:11:27,418
As the spider said to the fly.

1256
01:11:27,543 --> 01:11:29,294
Isn't that how it goes?

1257
01:11:29,420 --> 01:11:30,587
The rhyme?

1258
01:11:30,712 --> 01:11:33,424
It may be, Lizzie.

1259
01:11:33,549 --> 01:11:35,592
It may be.

1260
01:11:35,717 --> 01:11:36,760
Cucumber sandwich?

1261
01:11:36,885 --> 01:11:37,761
No, thanks.

1262
01:11:37,886 --> 01:11:39,596
Oh, I forgot.

1263
01:11:39,721 --> 01:11:41,932
You're not entirely partial
to cucumber, are you?

1264
01:11:45,227 --> 01:11:47,438
What's this about, Uncle?

1265
01:11:47,563 --> 01:11:49,940
Why'd you invite me?

1266
01:11:50,065 --> 01:11:51,775
I want to show you something.

1267
01:11:53,277 --> 01:11:54,903
Well, close your eyes.

1268
01:11:57,239 --> 01:11:58,615
Good girl.

1269
01:12:00,242 --> 01:12:01,910
Shh!

1270
01:12:23,307 --> 01:12:26,810
It's just my fun, Lizzie.

1271
01:12:26,935 --> 01:12:30,522
I like a good beating
every now and again.

1272
01:12:30,647 --> 01:12:32,649
Doesn't everyone?

1273
01:12:32,774 --> 01:12:34,818
I know her.

1274
01:12:34,943 --> 01:12:36,463
That's the girl who assisted
the Great Bolini.

1275
01:12:36,487 --> 01:12:38,030
She used to be sawn in half.

1276
01:12:38,155 --> 01:12:39,990
That's her, ducks.

1277
01:12:40,115 --> 01:12:43,327
What a performer.

1278
01:12:43,452 --> 01:12:45,829
But it's a shame she had
to leave the company.

1279
01:12:45,954 --> 01:12:47,664
Why have you shown me this?

1280
01:12:47,789 --> 01:12:49,166
Don't play the innocent with me.

1281
01:12:49,291 --> 01:12:51,668
I am not playing.
I am real.

1282
01:12:51,793 --> 01:12:54,213
Well, I'd be grateful
if you could oblige me, Lizzie,

1283
01:12:54,338 --> 01:12:57,841
with a pose, a tableau.

1284
01:12:57,966 --> 01:12:59,510
Perhaps a little beating?

1285
01:12:59,635 --> 01:13:01,303
I'd rather be destroyed first.

1286
01:13:03,347 --> 01:13:05,116
I'm prepared to forget
this visit ever took place.

1287
01:13:05,140 --> 01:13:08,852
Well, as I said,
it is a pity she had to go.

1288
01:13:08,977 --> 01:13:11,188
She grew tired of performing.

1289
01:13:11,313 --> 01:13:14,024
You would never be rid of me.

1290
01:13:14,149 --> 01:13:16,693
Dan would never allow it.

1291
01:13:16,818 --> 01:13:19,530
Well, I find,
as keeper of bunce,

1292
01:13:19,655 --> 01:13:22,699
that I can do as I please.

1293
01:13:22,824 --> 01:13:27,204
Now, you keep my secret

1294
01:13:27,329 --> 01:13:29,039
and I'll keep yours.

1295
01:13:29,164 --> 01:13:30,499
I have no secrets.

1296
01:13:32,668 --> 01:13:34,711
You shall in a moment.

1297
01:13:47,015 --> 01:13:49,226
He said I'm return
to him next Sunday

1298
01:13:49,351 --> 01:13:52,271
and every Sunday hereafter.

1299
01:13:52,396 --> 01:13:55,065
To do the same again?

1300
01:13:55,190 --> 01:13:57,943
There's photographs.

1301
01:13:58,068 --> 01:13:59,170
John, I had to speak
of it to somebody.

1302
01:13:59,194 --> 01:14:00,737
This is monstrous, Lizzie!

1303
01:14:00,862 --> 01:14:02,864
You can't tell a soul.

1304
01:14:05,200 --> 01:14:08,078
I shall put a stop to this.

1305
01:14:08,203 --> 01:14:11,081
But first...

1306
01:14:11,206 --> 01:14:12,457
I wish to do this.

1307
01:14:14,042 --> 01:14:15,752
He's robbed you of your honor.

1308
01:14:15,877 --> 01:14:18,046
Let me restore it to you.

1309
01:14:20,382 --> 01:14:24,261
Uncle died three days
after John confronted him.

1310
01:14:24,386 --> 01:14:25,637
Uncle was not young.

1311
01:14:25,762 --> 01:14:27,764
He had a weak heart
and a fondness for drink.

1312
01:14:27,889 --> 01:14:29,766
That's not what Dan Leno thinks.

1313
01:14:29,891 --> 01:14:32,603
He thinks that John blackmailed
Uncle into changing his will

1314
01:14:32,728 --> 01:14:34,271
and then killed him.

1315
01:14:34,396 --> 01:14:36,565
£500 and the camera.

1316
01:14:38,400 --> 01:14:41,236
It would seem I gave
an excellent beating.

1317
01:14:43,071 --> 01:14:46,783
You don't want
to be saved, do you?

1318
01:14:46,908 --> 01:14:48,785
Not by me.

1319
01:14:48,910 --> 01:14:51,622
Not by any man.

1320
01:14:51,747 --> 01:14:53,832
I don't deserve to be saved.

1321
01:15:10,265 --> 01:15:11,308
John, I can't.

1322
01:15:11,433 --> 01:15:13,143
Huh?
What do you mean?

1323
01:15:13,268 --> 01:15:14,412
We're husband and wife
now, Lizzie.

1324
01:15:14,436 --> 01:15:15,854
I know.

1325
01:15:15,979 --> 01:15:17,814
Three years I've waited.

1326
01:15:17,939 --> 01:15:21,318
Three years of courtship
and endless bloody engagement.

1327
01:15:21,443 --> 01:15:24,655
It's hardly my fault that panto
season extended 'til Easter.

1328
01:15:24,780 --> 01:15:27,324
Would you have had me spend our
wedding night playing Aladdin?

1329
01:15:27,449 --> 01:15:28,659
It seems now that option

1330
01:15:28,784 --> 01:15:30,064
would've been
scarcely different.

1331
01:15:30,118 --> 01:15:31,262
Please, John,
just try to understand.

1332
01:15:31,286 --> 01:15:33,205
No, you understand!

1333
01:15:33,330 --> 01:15:35,666
John, please, I don't like it.

1334
01:15:35,791 --> 01:15:37,769
I don't ask for gratitude
for all I've done for you.

1335
01:15:37,793 --> 01:15:42,339
All I ask is that you fulfill
your duties as a wife.

1336
01:15:54,976 --> 01:15:57,688
What are you doing here?

1337
01:15:59,815 --> 01:16:01,149
Hello.

1338
01:16:02,359 --> 01:16:04,069
- Hello.
- Hello.

1339
01:16:04,194 --> 01:16:07,364
I'll have a new contract
drawn up tomorrow, John John.

1340
01:16:07,489 --> 01:16:11,034
- But don't you worry.
- Lizzie!

1341
01:16:11,159 --> 01:16:12,494
Lizzie.

1342
01:16:15,497 --> 01:16:18,542
Well, well.

1343
01:16:18,667 --> 01:16:22,045
If it isn't Mrs. John Cree.

1344
01:16:22,170 --> 01:16:23,815
Three months of married life
and you're missing

1345
01:16:23,839 --> 01:16:25,882
the roar
of the greasepaint already.

1346
01:16:26,007 --> 01:16:27,384
Oh, nonsense.

1347
01:16:27,509 --> 01:16:30,053
I've been too busy
to miss anything.

1348
01:16:30,178 --> 01:16:31,888
Oh, what tosh!

1349
01:16:32,013 --> 01:16:35,225
Little Lizzie without
an audience.

1350
01:16:35,350 --> 01:16:38,228
You mustn't let that
rotten man order you about so.

1351
01:16:38,353 --> 01:16:40,564
John is perfectly happy
for me to perform.

1352
01:16:40,689 --> 01:16:42,649
Still going to play the lead
in "Misery Junction."

1353
01:16:42,691 --> 01:16:44,401
Oh, come of it, Lizzie.

1354
01:16:44,526 --> 01:16:46,403
That man's so petrified
of failure

1355
01:16:46,528 --> 01:16:48,280
he'll never bring himself
to finish it.

1356
01:16:48,405 --> 01:16:50,574
He's writing every day
at the library.

1357
01:16:50,699 --> 01:16:52,242
It's almost complete.

1358
01:16:52,367 --> 01:16:54,578
I'm telling you as a friend,
Lizzie.

1359
01:16:54,703 --> 01:16:58,415
Forget "Misery Junction."
Forget John.

1360
01:16:58,540 --> 01:17:00,250
If you want your name
etched in stone,

1361
01:17:00,375 --> 01:17:04,755
you're gonna have to take up
the chisel yourself.

1362
01:17:04,880 --> 01:17:06,923
So, to what do we owe
the pleasure?

1363
01:17:07,048 --> 01:17:08,925
I'm actually here
to see Aveline.

1364
01:17:12,053 --> 01:17:14,431
I have a proposition
for you, dear.

1365
01:17:14,556 --> 01:17:16,933
I'm in need of a ladies' maid.

1366
01:17:17,058 --> 01:17:19,436
- Me?
- Mm-hmm.

1367
01:17:19,561 --> 01:17:21,104
You must be playing.

1368
01:17:21,229 --> 01:17:24,107
I can offer you twice the weekly
wage you're earning here.

1369
01:17:24,232 --> 01:17:27,486
What I require is some help
bearing the load of my...

1370
01:17:27,611 --> 01:17:29,488
my wifely duties.

1371
01:17:29,613 --> 01:17:32,115
Dear God, Lizzie.

1372
01:17:53,929 --> 01:17:56,306
Do you know how John's play
is coming along?

1373
01:17:56,431 --> 01:17:59,309
Very nicely, he tells me.

1374
01:17:59,434 --> 01:18:00,714
You know,
there's no need for you

1375
01:18:00,811 --> 01:18:03,647
to prepare his
nightly cordial, Lizzie.

1376
01:18:03,772 --> 01:18:05,148
I can do it.

1377
01:18:05,273 --> 01:18:06,650
I make one for myself.

1378
01:18:06,775 --> 01:18:08,652
It's no more effort
to prepare two.

1379
01:18:08,777 --> 01:18:10,987
I'd be happy to make both.

1380
01:18:11,112 --> 01:18:12,989
I could bring yours
to your quarters

1381
01:18:13,114 --> 01:18:15,659
before I take John's to his.

1382
01:19:24,185 --> 01:19:25,854
Mm.

1383
01:20:01,389 --> 01:20:02,933
What on earth
are you doing here?

1384
01:20:03,058 --> 01:20:04,338
I should ask you the same thing,

1385
01:20:04,392 --> 01:20:05,268
because I know what it is
you're not doing,

1386
01:20:05,393 --> 01:20:06,770
and that is writing.

1387
01:20:06,895 --> 01:20:08,539
Why tell me "Misery Junction"
was not finished

1388
01:20:08,563 --> 01:20:10,273
when it was hardly even begun?
It was!

1389
01:20:10,398 --> 01:20:13,443
It's nearly complete.
I've just put it aside for now.

1390
01:20:13,568 --> 01:20:15,445
Put it aside?

1391
01:20:15,570 --> 01:20:16,780
I support you financially.

1392
01:20:16,905 --> 01:20:18,215
I allow that your
every need is met!

1393
01:20:18,239 --> 01:20:20,784
Oh, don't pillory me
about my damn play

1394
01:20:20,909 --> 01:20:23,119
if what really irks you
is Aveline.

1395
01:20:23,244 --> 01:20:26,122
Why would that irk me?

1396
01:20:26,247 --> 01:20:28,124
Go home, Lizzie.

1397
01:20:28,249 --> 01:20:29,960
Let me finish my research.

1398
01:20:30,085 --> 01:20:31,461
Your research?

1399
01:20:31,586 --> 01:20:33,296
Into what?

1400
01:20:33,421 --> 01:20:34,506
My play.

1401
01:20:34,631 --> 01:20:37,467
My new play.

1402
01:20:37,592 --> 01:20:39,636
But what of "Misery Junction"?

1403
01:20:39,761 --> 01:20:42,639
I grew tired of Katherine Dove.

1404
01:20:42,764 --> 01:20:44,641
Is there a role in it for me?

1405
01:20:44,766 --> 01:20:45,642
No, Lizzie.

1406
01:20:45,767 --> 01:20:47,477
There is not.

1407
01:20:47,602 --> 01:20:49,312
You're a lady now,

1408
01:20:49,437 --> 01:20:52,315
and the stage
is no place for a lady.

1409
01:21:00,156 --> 01:21:03,660
You staged it without permission
and it was poorly received.

1410
01:21:03,785 --> 01:21:07,497
"'Misery Junction' leaves
audience in misery, indeed."

1411
01:21:07,622 --> 01:21:09,666
Isn't it funny how
the savage reviews are the ones

1412
01:21:09,791 --> 01:21:11,334
you can recall word for word?

1413
01:21:16,631 --> 01:21:18,174
More! More!

1414
01:21:18,299 --> 01:21:19,676
Uncle, please.

1415
01:21:19,801 --> 01:21:21,177
You have stolen my honor!

1416
01:21:21,302 --> 01:21:22,554
I am innocent!

1417
01:21:22,679 --> 01:21:24,014
You wish to be a man?

1418
01:21:24,139 --> 01:21:25,682
Just pretend that I'm a woman!

1419
01:21:25,807 --> 01:21:27,392
It's Lizzie they're mocking,
John.

1420
01:21:27,517 --> 01:21:29,060
It's not your play.

1421
01:21:29,185 --> 01:21:30,687
You lie!
This was not for me!

1422
01:21:30,812 --> 01:21:32,022
This was for you!

1423
01:21:32,147 --> 01:21:33,666
You wish to prove
yourself as an actress,

1424
01:21:33,690 --> 01:21:35,734
you selfish whore,
and you failed even at that!

1425
01:21:35,859 --> 01:21:37,569
You are the failure.

1426
01:21:37,694 --> 01:21:39,738
- Jesus!
- See?

1427
01:21:39,863 --> 01:21:41,223
Where's the white knight now,
John?

1428
01:21:41,322 --> 01:21:42,699
You are just as all men.

1429
01:21:42,824 --> 01:21:44,034
One more word from your mouth

1430
01:21:44,159 --> 01:21:45,511
and I will snap
your wretched neck!

1431
01:21:45,535 --> 01:21:47,704
John, go home.

1432
01:21:47,829 --> 01:21:50,582
My play was unfinished
and you destroyed it!

1433
01:21:50,707 --> 01:21:53,251
Destroyed me and my reputation!

1434
01:21:53,376 --> 01:21:54,544
You don't have a reputation!

1435
01:21:54,669 --> 01:21:56,212
Who do you believe
yourself to be?

1436
01:21:56,337 --> 01:21:59,549
You are nobody, John, nobody,
and you never will be!

1437
01:21:59,674 --> 01:22:01,384
Get out of here, John.

1438
01:22:01,509 --> 01:22:04,220
Out!

1439
01:22:04,345 --> 01:22:05,221
Look at you both.

1440
01:22:05,346 --> 01:22:06,890
You're clowns.

1441
01:22:07,015 --> 01:22:08,725
Worthless clowns.

1442
01:22:08,850 --> 01:22:12,103
You're the ones who'll
be forgotten, not me.

1443
01:22:12,228 --> 01:22:14,272
Not me.

1444
01:22:17,192 --> 01:22:19,402
Whoa! Whoa!

1445
01:22:19,527 --> 01:22:21,005
- John?
- Drive on.

1446
01:22:21,029 --> 01:22:22,048
- John.
- Giddyup!

1447
01:22:22,072 --> 01:22:23,948
John.

1448
01:22:24,074 --> 01:22:26,409
John.

1449
01:22:26,534 --> 01:22:27,744
John!

1450
01:22:27,869 --> 01:22:29,746
That opening night,
September the 5th,

1451
01:22:29,871 --> 01:22:32,582
it drove him over the edge,
but not to suicide.

1452
01:22:32,707 --> 01:22:35,085
It drove him to prove to
the world that he was an artist.

1453
01:22:35,210 --> 01:22:37,295
That night, the Golem
made his first kill,

1454
01:22:37,420 --> 01:22:39,422
and you think it's your fault.

1455
01:22:39,547 --> 01:22:40,691
You are putting words
in my mouth.

1456
01:22:40,715 --> 01:22:42,258
Why this dance, Lizzie?

1457
01:22:42,383 --> 01:22:44,260
Why won't you admit
that you came to know

1458
01:22:44,385 --> 01:22:45,929
or at least suspect
what he'd become?

1459
01:22:46,054 --> 01:22:48,098
If this is a dance,
it is you who is leading.

1460
01:22:48,223 --> 01:22:51,935
Let me read you the last entry.

1461
01:22:52,060 --> 01:22:54,270
"Ratcliffe Highway was
a tour de force."

1462
01:22:54,395 --> 01:22:57,607
And as an actor may take home
a program as a souvenir,

1463
01:22:57,732 --> 01:23:00,443
so I returned with
a blood-soaked shawl

1464
01:23:00,568 --> 01:23:02,445
belonging to the clothes
seller's wife.

1465
01:23:02,570 --> 01:23:04,781
The next night,
fearful of discovery,

1466
01:23:04,906 --> 01:23:06,616
I ventured to destroy it,

1467
01:23:06,741 --> 01:23:09,244
and therein lay my mistake.

1468
01:23:12,747 --> 01:23:14,290
John, you're home.

1469
01:23:14,415 --> 01:23:16,251
I didn't hear you come in.

1470
01:23:24,259 --> 01:23:28,263
There were no questions
asked, no recriminations.

1471
01:23:37,438 --> 01:23:40,775
I believe a homemade punishment
may be planned for me instead.

1472
01:24:03,506 --> 01:24:06,301
I no longer feel safe
under my own roof.

1473
01:24:08,970 --> 01:24:11,514
I cannot go on like this.

1474
01:24:13,641 --> 01:24:16,352
You poisoned him, didn't you?

1475
01:24:19,981 --> 01:24:21,900
Lizzie, listen to me.
We have a few minutes.

1476
01:24:22,025 --> 01:24:23,735
You can still change your plea.
Confess.

1477
01:24:23,860 --> 01:24:25,420
You did it because
you knew what he was.

1478
01:24:25,486 --> 01:24:27,697
You did it because you were
in fear for your life.

1479
01:24:27,822 --> 01:24:29,699
I promise you'll have
the sympathy of the jury.

1480
01:24:29,824 --> 01:24:31,367
I don't want their sympathy.

1481
01:24:31,492 --> 01:24:33,369
Why do you not
deserve redemption?

1482
01:24:33,494 --> 01:24:34,972
Because you killed him
or because you believe

1483
01:24:34,996 --> 01:24:36,039
you created a monster?

1484
01:24:36,164 --> 01:24:37,707
What I deserve is
to live freely,

1485
01:24:37,832 --> 01:24:39,643
and in death be remembered
for my accomplishments,

1486
01:24:39,667 --> 01:24:41,544
not as the wife
who poisoned her husband,

1487
01:24:41,669 --> 01:24:43,922
my name forever tethered to his.

1488
01:24:44,047 --> 01:24:44,923
Mrs. Cree.

1489
01:24:47,342 --> 01:24:49,052
While that chance remains,
I have no choice

1490
01:24:49,177 --> 01:24:50,929
but to cling to it.

1491
01:24:57,352 --> 01:24:59,395
Have the jury reached a verdict?

1492
01:24:59,520 --> 01:25:01,231
Yes, my lord.

1493
01:25:01,356 --> 01:25:04,234
How do the jury
find the defendant?

1494
01:25:04,359 --> 01:25:05,944
Guilty.

1495
01:25:06,069 --> 01:25:07,737
Order!

1496
01:25:07,862 --> 01:25:09,739
Order!

1497
01:25:09,864 --> 01:25:13,785
Elizabeth Cree, you will be
returned to prison

1498
01:25:13,910 --> 01:25:16,913
and taken from there
to a place of execution,

1499
01:25:17,038 --> 01:25:18,748
where at 10:00 tomorrow morning,

1500
01:25:18,873 --> 01:25:22,085
you will be hanged by the neck
until you are dead.

1501
01:25:22,210 --> 01:25:24,921
May the Lord have mercy
on your soul.

1502
01:25:25,046 --> 01:25:26,756
Inspector Kildare,
Scotland Yard.

1503
01:25:26,881 --> 01:25:28,383
I need a moment with her,
please.

1504
01:25:32,553 --> 01:25:33,638
You don't deserve this.

1505
01:25:33,763 --> 01:25:35,163
It's done.
I hang tomorrow at 10:00.

1506
01:25:35,223 --> 01:25:36,933
No.
I won't let it happen.

1507
01:25:37,058 --> 01:25:38,476
John Cree was a murderer.

1508
01:25:38,601 --> 01:25:40,770
I mean to prove it
and appeal for your pardon.

1509
01:25:40,895 --> 01:25:42,814
The world needs
to know the truth.

1510
01:25:49,070 --> 01:25:50,655
I'd like for you
to unmask the Golem.

1511
01:25:50,780 --> 01:25:52,490
This is your moment,
your chance.

1512
01:25:52,615 --> 01:25:54,218
I'd like for you to have that.

1513
01:25:54,242 --> 01:25:55,522
I'm sorry, sir.
We need to leave.

1514
01:25:58,579 --> 01:26:00,164
We don't have much time.

1515
01:26:00,290 --> 01:26:02,101
The manuscript of "Misery
Junction" is handwritten.

1516
01:26:02,125 --> 01:26:03,334
Dan may still have it.

1517
01:26:03,459 --> 01:26:05,795
I shall stop this.
I promise you.

1518
01:26:10,925 --> 01:26:13,636
You filthy...

1519
01:26:28,484 --> 01:26:30,945
Here we are again!

1520
01:26:32,822 --> 01:26:35,825
Lizzie paid for the hire
of the theatre.

1521
01:26:35,950 --> 01:26:38,828
I advised her against it,
but she was adamant.

1522
01:26:38,953 --> 01:26:40,204
And it was not a success.

1523
01:26:42,165 --> 01:26:43,833
That's putting it mildly.

1524
01:26:43,958 --> 01:26:46,377
So put it any way that you will.

1525
01:26:46,502 --> 01:26:48,046
Barely any tickets sold,

1526
01:26:48,171 --> 01:26:51,007
but Lizzie insisted
on a full house,

1527
01:26:51,132 --> 01:26:54,177
so she took to the streets
and gave them away to the poor.

1528
01:26:56,637 --> 01:26:57,638
Ah.

1529
01:27:03,311 --> 01:27:05,688
Aha! Here it is.

1530
01:27:05,813 --> 01:27:08,191
"Misery Junction."

1531
01:27:11,819 --> 01:27:14,530
It's typeset.

1532
01:27:14,655 --> 01:27:17,700
Oh, I don't have the original
manuscript, I'm afraid.

1533
01:27:17,825 --> 01:27:19,869
A usual practice is
to have it archived,

1534
01:27:19,994 --> 01:27:22,205
unless the author asks
for it back, which he didn't.

1535
01:27:22,330 --> 01:27:24,248
Archived... Where?

1536
01:27:24,374 --> 01:27:27,710
The librarian agreed
to open up early, sir.

1537
01:27:27,835 --> 01:27:29,379
He should be here any moment.

1538
01:27:29,504 --> 01:27:30,880
I pray he is.

1539
01:27:31,005 --> 01:27:32,757
They hang her at 10:00.

1540
01:27:51,192 --> 01:27:54,237
Lizzie!

1541
01:27:54,362 --> 01:27:56,239
Lizzie!

1542
01:27:58,032 --> 01:28:00,701
Lizzie!

1543
01:28:06,374 --> 01:28:07,583
Lizzie.

1544
01:28:07,708 --> 01:28:08,918
I'm ready.

1545
01:28:22,932 --> 01:28:24,600
But this is most odd.

1546
01:28:24,725 --> 01:28:25,725
Should be here.

1547
01:28:25,768 --> 01:28:27,770
Could someone have withdrawn it?

1548
01:28:27,895 --> 01:28:30,648
Not unless they did so just now.

1549
01:28:30,773 --> 01:28:31,983
Quickly, the door.

1550
01:28:32,108 --> 01:28:33,568
Sir!

1551
01:28:38,614 --> 01:28:40,783
Unhand me!
I've done nothing wrong.

1552
01:28:40,908 --> 01:28:43,619
Then perhaps you can tell us
why the hurry to obtain this?

1553
01:28:43,744 --> 01:28:45,788
I plan to rewrite it, sir.

1554
01:28:45,913 --> 01:28:46,956
Demand a production.

1555
01:28:47,081 --> 01:28:49,834
A topical shocker
about Lizzie Cree.

1556
01:28:49,959 --> 01:28:51,836
Now she's to be hanged,
it'll be a smash.

1557
01:28:51,961 --> 01:28:53,230
Really?
So you're a writer now,

1558
01:28:53,254 --> 01:28:54,297
are you, Miss Ortega?

1559
01:28:54,422 --> 01:28:55,631
No, sir.

1560
01:28:55,756 --> 01:28:57,967
But it won't require much work.

1561
01:28:58,092 --> 01:29:00,136
It was the story of her life,
after all.

1562
01:29:00,261 --> 01:29:03,473
My idea is to begin
the play at the gallows,

1563
01:29:03,598 --> 01:29:05,516
then retrace each step
that led her to them.

1564
01:29:05,641 --> 01:29:08,478
I cannot help but think that the
addition of a murderous husband

1565
01:29:08,603 --> 01:29:09,812
might be popular.

1566
01:29:09,937 --> 01:29:12,982
I told you all I know, sir.

1567
01:29:13,107 --> 01:29:14,817
John is innocent.

1568
01:29:49,977 --> 01:29:51,187
Jesus!

1569
01:29:51,312 --> 01:29:53,856
You're the ones
who'll be forgotten!

1570
01:29:53,981 --> 01:29:54,982
Not me.

1571
01:30:01,989 --> 01:30:03,199
Is it time?

1572
01:30:03,324 --> 01:30:05,368
There's no one here.

1573
01:30:05,493 --> 01:30:08,037
They hardly ever admit the
public these days, Mrs. Cree.

1574
01:30:08,162 --> 01:30:10,206
Only for the most hated.

1575
01:30:10,331 --> 01:30:12,583
Please, no.
You must help me.

1576
01:30:12,708 --> 01:30:14,210
Please.
Please tell them to wait.

1577
01:30:14,335 --> 01:30:16,420
- Inspector Kildare is coming.
- I'm sorry.

1578
01:30:16,546 --> 01:30:18,881
Can't you go any faster?

1579
01:30:19,006 --> 01:30:20,150
Prison's just around the corner.

1580
01:30:20,174 --> 01:30:21,217
I know!

1581
01:30:21,342 --> 01:30:23,219
No, we must wait
for him, please.

1582
01:30:23,344 --> 01:30:24,584
This is wrong!
He will prove it!

1583
01:30:24,679 --> 01:30:25,959
I beg you, just a little longer!

1584
01:30:26,013 --> 01:30:27,890
I'm sorry.

1585
01:30:31,894 --> 01:30:33,396
Come on!

1586
01:30:58,379 --> 01:30:59,630
Coming through.

1587
01:31:05,720 --> 01:31:07,430
Steady, sir.

1588
01:31:07,555 --> 01:31:08,865
- Who are you here for?
- Elizabeth Cree.

1589
01:31:08,889 --> 01:31:10,266
Say I'm not too late.

1590
01:31:10,391 --> 01:31:13,102
They're just taking her down.
Quick as you can.

1591
01:31:13,227 --> 01:31:14,604
Send for the magistrate!

1592
01:31:19,066 --> 01:31:21,444
Stop! Stop!

1593
01:31:31,746 --> 01:31:33,122
Don't thank me yet.

1594
01:31:33,247 --> 01:31:34,433
All they've given me
is an hour's grace

1595
01:31:34,457 --> 01:31:35,958
to speak to the magistrate.

1596
01:31:36,083 --> 01:31:37,894
I've still to convince him
to reduce your sentence.

1597
01:31:37,918 --> 01:31:39,462
Don't be glum.

1598
01:31:39,587 --> 01:31:41,130
You have the Golem.

1599
01:31:41,255 --> 01:31:44,467
The world will know
the real story, and it's you...

1600
01:31:44,592 --> 01:31:49,305
you who will know every chapter,
who will tell it.

1601
01:31:49,430 --> 01:31:50,973
You have my gratitude.
Always.

1602
01:31:51,098 --> 01:31:53,768
And you mine.

1603
01:31:59,607 --> 01:32:02,109
Lizzie, Lizzie, don't.

1604
01:32:06,614 --> 01:32:08,895
Could any believe John
Cree capable of such deeds?

1605
01:32:08,949 --> 01:32:10,993
I guarantee it.

1606
01:32:11,118 --> 01:32:12,286
Have no doubt.

1607
01:32:15,331 --> 01:32:17,124
Then let us bring
this to an end.

1608
01:32:23,464 --> 01:32:26,175
Here's what you will write.

1609
01:32:26,300 --> 01:32:30,346
"I am Elizabeth Cree,
and in September of this year,

1610
01:32:30,471 --> 01:32:35,059
I came to know that my husband
was the Limehouse Golem."

1611
01:32:35,184 --> 01:32:37,186
All you need to do
is tell the truth.

1612
01:32:39,980 --> 01:32:42,817
I have never told you anything
but the truth, Kildare.

1613
01:33:24,525 --> 01:33:26,569
You shall have your moment,
and I mine.

1614
01:33:30,531 --> 01:33:32,931
In the temple of fame, our names
will be written side-by-side

1615
01:33:33,033 --> 01:33:34,535
in stone for all time.

1616
01:33:44,211 --> 01:33:46,255
Who was here
on September the 24th?

1617
01:33:46,380 --> 01:33:48,525
There were four men
in the reading room that day,

1618
01:33:48,549 --> 01:33:49,989
but there's no earthly way
of knowing

1619
01:33:50,050 --> 01:33:52,386
what anyone read
or when they read it.

1620
01:33:56,932 --> 01:33:58,642
John. You're home.

1621
01:33:58,768 --> 01:34:00,102
I didn't hear you come in.

1622
01:34:03,397 --> 01:34:08,110
There were no questions asked,
no recriminations.

1623
01:34:08,235 --> 01:34:11,405
I believe a homemade punishment
may be planned for me instead.

1624
01:34:13,741 --> 01:34:15,785
I no longer feel safe
under my own roof.

1625
01:34:15,910 --> 01:34:18,579
I cannot go on like this.

1626
01:34:21,457 --> 01:34:23,959
Still, we had agreement
to keep each other's secrets.

1627
01:34:24,084 --> 01:34:25,628
And you didn't keep mine,
did you?

1628
01:34:25,753 --> 01:34:27,797
I wonder what I should do
with yours.

1629
01:34:27,922 --> 01:34:29,632
I think you should take it
to the grave.

1630
01:34:34,929 --> 01:34:36,305
Aah!

1631
01:35:06,460 --> 01:35:08,128
Mr. Gerrard, sir?

1632
01:35:24,478 --> 01:35:25,896
Annie?

1633
01:35:44,164 --> 01:35:45,708
Oh, I know, I know.

1634
01:35:45,833 --> 01:35:48,043
Few would think a woman
capable of such artistry.

1635
01:36:10,691 --> 01:36:12,067
Here we are again!

1636
01:36:58,739 --> 01:36:59,949
You were too late?

1637
01:37:03,243 --> 01:37:04,787
This, um...

1638
01:37:04,912 --> 01:37:07,122
This is probably the last thing
you want at present,

1639
01:37:07,247 --> 01:37:10,793
but they're waiting
for you downstairs.

1640
01:37:10,918 --> 01:37:12,962
You're about to be
the toast of London, John.

1641
01:37:20,260 --> 01:37:22,638
I know how much you cared
for her.

1642
01:37:22,763 --> 01:37:24,807
Just...

1643
01:37:24,932 --> 01:37:27,309
know how grateful she would
be that the world

1644
01:37:27,434 --> 01:37:30,479
will know what her
bastard husband really was.

1645
01:37:30,604 --> 01:37:33,649
Not just as a murderer, but as
a man who sought to deny her

1646
01:37:33,774 --> 01:37:35,651
all she wanted to be.

1647
01:37:35,776 --> 01:37:38,112
It's you who saved her honor.

1648
01:37:40,447 --> 01:37:41,782
Her memory.

1649
01:37:44,493 --> 01:37:46,453
She would've wanted you
to have this.

1650
01:38:04,638 --> 01:38:06,515
No! We must wait
for him. Please!

1651
01:38:06,640 --> 01:38:07,659
This is wrong, he will prove it!

1652
01:38:07,683 --> 01:38:08,952
I beg you, just a little longer!

1653
01:38:08,976 --> 01:38:11,562
I...

1654
01:38:11,687 --> 01:38:16,233
I don't believe Inspector
Kildare will be coming back.

1655
01:38:21,989 --> 01:38:23,198
I am not a poisoner.

1656
01:38:23,323 --> 01:38:24,700
I believe you.

1657
01:38:24,825 --> 01:38:26,577
I am so much more.

1658
01:38:26,702 --> 01:38:30,748
We shall be issuing
our full report on John Cree

1659
01:38:30,873 --> 01:38:32,207
in an hour, gentlemen.

1660
01:38:32,332 --> 01:38:35,878
Well.
It seems the show must go on.

1661
01:38:36,003 --> 01:38:39,715
Londoners can sleep easy
in their beds again.

1662
01:38:39,840 --> 01:38:41,425
The Golem is no more.

1663
01:38:41,550 --> 01:38:42,986
Inspector! Inspector,

1664
01:38:43,010 --> 01:38:45,387
any comments
on your promotion, sir?

1665
01:38:48,182 --> 01:38:49,391
Any last words?

1666
01:38:49,516 --> 01:38:51,435
Here we are again!

1667
01:40:14,935 --> 01:40:19,148
Let us begin, my friends,

1668
01:40:19,273 --> 01:40:21,650
at the end.

1669
01:41:14,828 --> 01:41:17,039
N-not the green, love, the red.

1670
01:41:17,164 --> 01:41:20,042
Mother doesn't get sick
until scene four.

1671
01:41:27,007 --> 01:41:28,717
Did anyone check the safety?

1672
01:41:40,354 --> 01:41:41,772
Take her weight. Take...

1673
01:41:46,693 --> 01:41:48,028
What's going on?

1674
01:41:49,529 --> 01:41:50,572
Is she breathing?

1675
01:41:56,870 --> 01:42:00,415
We have to get back out there.

1676
01:42:00,540 --> 01:42:03,126
You're Lizzie's mother now.

1677
01:42:17,391 --> 01:42:19,101
I'll be Lizzie.

1678
01:42:58,473 --> 01:43:01,143
