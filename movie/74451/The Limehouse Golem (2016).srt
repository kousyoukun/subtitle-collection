1
00:00:54,426 --> 00:01:00,843
Let us begin, my friends,
at the end.

2
00:01:20,926 --> 00:01:23,135
John?

3
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:24,968
John!

4
00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:59,467
He left nothing?

5
00:01:59,592 --> 00:02:01,176
No... note?

6
00:02:01,301 --> 00:02:02,509
If he meant to poison himself,

7
00:02:02,634 --> 00:02:04,467
why would he not
at least leave a note?

8
00:02:04,592 --> 00:02:06,634
I fear that the act of
burning his papers

9
00:02:06,759 --> 00:02:08,926
bears testament enough
to his state of mind.

10
00:02:10,592 --> 00:02:11,968
Mrs. Cree...? Forgive me...

11
00:02:12,093 --> 00:02:14,634
I-I know this is neither
the time nor the place...

12
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:19,301
but may I say what an ardent
admirer I am of your work?

13
00:02:19,425 --> 00:02:21,968
I looked in the kitchen, sir.

14
00:02:22,093 --> 00:02:24,801
This was all I could find.

15
00:02:24,926 --> 00:02:28,301
I'm afraid this'll be it.

16
00:02:28,425 --> 00:02:30,343
There was residue in a glass
on the nightstand.

17
00:02:30,467 --> 00:02:32,301
Oh, it can't have been
in there, sir.

18
00:02:32,425 --> 00:02:35,135
His nightly cordial was always
prepared by Mrs. Cree.

19
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:37,009
Aveline...?

20
00:02:37,135 --> 00:02:41,509
You... did not make the drink?

21
00:02:41,634 --> 00:02:44,301
Surely you're not
asking me in earnest

22
00:02:44,425 --> 00:02:46,509
if I poisoned my husband?

23
00:02:46,634 --> 00:02:49,301
Oh, sir, believe me,
she cannot have done this!

24
00:02:49,425 --> 00:02:51,843
The two of them were in a most
violent dispute yesterday!

25
00:02:51,968 --> 00:02:53,801
Why would she prepare
Mr. Cree a nightcap

26
00:02:53,926 --> 00:02:55,236
when they were not
on speaking terms?

27
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:57,634
Aveline, what has possessed you?

28
00:02:57,759 --> 00:03:01,135
Sir, please,
allow me to explain.

29
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:02,801
I'm sorry, Mrs. Cree.

30
00:03:02,926 --> 00:03:05,467
You'll need to do that
down at Scotland Yard.

31
00:03:11,592 --> 00:03:17,176
A woman accused of
poisoning her husband.

32
00:03:17,301 --> 00:03:20,093
But not just any woman...

33
00:03:21,926 --> 00:03:23,968
Little Lizzie,

34
00:03:24,093 --> 00:03:29,300
darling of the music halls.

35
00:03:29,425 --> 00:03:31,843
But the city was in thrall

36
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:37,634
with the fearsome
Limehouse Golem.

37
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:39,467
Who was he?

38
00:03:39,592 --> 00:03:42,467
Who would be his next victim?

39
00:03:42,592 --> 00:03:46,300
The Golem had last struck

40
00:03:46,425 --> 00:03:50,176
the day before her arrest.

41
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:52,968
And his was the name

42
00:03:53,093 --> 00:03:56,135
on every Londoner's lips.

43
00:04:15,093 --> 00:04:17,009
How many are dead?

44
00:04:17,135 --> 00:04:19,634
Five.

45
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:24,509
Shopkeeper Mr. Gerrard,
his wife Mary, their maid...

46
00:04:24,634 --> 00:04:27,467
and the two Gerrard children.

47
00:04:29,425 --> 00:04:31,509
It's not... number 29.

48
00:04:31,634 --> 00:04:33,300
29 Ratcliffe Highway?

49
00:04:33,425 --> 00:04:34,300
What of it?

50
00:04:34,425 --> 00:04:35,968
The Ratcliffe Highway murders?

51
00:04:36,093 --> 00:04:37,634
John Williams?

52
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:39,467
It's a bit before my time.

53
00:04:39,592 --> 00:04:41,968
And mine!
It was 70 years ago!

54
00:04:43,801 --> 00:04:45,634
Inspector Roberts!

55
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:47,610
Can you confirm that
this is the work of the Golem?

56
00:04:47,634 --> 00:04:48,944
What is it about this house?

57
00:04:48,968 --> 00:04:50,467
Do you think it could be cursed,
sir?

58
00:04:50,592 --> 00:04:53,300
Gentlemen, gentlemen, please!

59
00:04:53,425 --> 00:04:57,968
I'd ask you to, uh, direct
your requests to my colleague,

60
00:04:58,093 --> 00:05:01,968
Detective Inspector Kildare.
He's taking over the case.

61
00:05:02,093 --> 00:05:03,902
Kildare?
How are you spelling that?

62
00:05:03,926 --> 00:05:05,342
Taking over?

63
00:05:05,467 --> 00:05:09,009
I'm just stepping aside,
not stepping down.

64
00:05:11,093 --> 00:05:14,467
The public seeks reassurance,
Kildare.

65
00:05:14,592 --> 00:05:17,259
What better way than to
give them new blood?

66
00:05:18,259 --> 00:05:20,568
Are you fearful of stepping into the
shoes of the great Mr. Roberts?

67
00:05:20,592 --> 00:05:22,568
Can you confirm
this is the work of the Golem?

68
00:05:22,592 --> 00:05:25,135
How many more people have to die
before the Golem is caught?

69
00:05:25,259 --> 00:05:26,467
Driver!

70
00:05:28,425 --> 00:05:31,634
Detective Roberts!

71
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:33,634
Inspector Kildare, is it true

72
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:35,175
that this is
your first murder case?

73
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:36,968
Inspector Kildare!

74
00:05:37,093 --> 00:05:38,300
Kildare!

75
00:05:38,425 --> 00:05:39,843
Move. Move back.

76
00:05:39,968 --> 00:05:41,135
Do you know if they'll be

77
00:05:41,259 --> 00:05:42,443
displaying the bodies today,
sir?

78
00:05:42,467 --> 00:05:43,467
Step aside, sir.

79
00:05:43,592 --> 00:05:45,175
The maid was found over there.

80
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:47,568
Were there footprints when you
arrived? The Golem's prints?

81
00:05:47,592 --> 00:05:49,111
Half of Limehouse
was already here.

82
00:05:49,135 --> 00:05:50,573
Which of the victims
was found there?

83
00:05:50,634 --> 00:05:52,509
None. The Golem moved
that one himself.

84
00:05:52,634 --> 00:05:54,634
- Either Mr. or Mrs. Gerrard.
- More likely him.

85
00:05:54,759 --> 00:05:55,777
If the maid was killed first,

86
00:05:55,801 --> 00:05:57,300
he'd investigate
the disturbance.

87
00:05:57,425 --> 00:05:59,401
- Where is her body now?
- We took her upstairs, sir.

88
00:05:59,425 --> 00:06:01,467
At least up there we can
keep the Hoi poloi out.

89
00:06:01,592 --> 00:06:03,777
- Down here is a lost cause.
- They can't all be reporters.

90
00:06:03,801 --> 00:06:06,467
Oh, no. Locals looking
for entertainment.

91
00:06:06,592 --> 00:06:07,968
Cheaper than a ticket
to a shocker.

92
00:06:08,093 --> 00:06:10,634
Sometimes I suspect if
I was dispatched to hell,

93
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:13,467
I'd barely notice the change,
bar the weather.

94
00:06:13,592 --> 00:06:14,801
This is Inspector Kildare.

95
00:06:14,926 --> 00:06:17,467
- Taking over from Roberts.
- Sir.

96
00:06:17,592 --> 00:06:20,467
Can you tell this idiot
to let me up?

97
00:06:20,592 --> 00:06:22,634
I'm with the Evening Post!

98
00:06:32,592 --> 00:06:34,968
This is the maid?

99
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:45,467
I'm sorry.

100
00:06:45,592 --> 00:06:47,592
I've never seen anything
of this kind.

101
00:06:49,467 --> 00:06:50,801
Neither have I.

102
00:07:33,801 --> 00:07:37,801
"He who observes
spills no less blood

103
00:07:37,926 --> 00:07:40,342
than he who inflicts the blow."

104
00:07:40,467 --> 00:07:42,300
Lactantius.

105
00:07:42,425 --> 00:07:45,175
Impressive, sir.

106
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:48,009
The truth has a habit
of sticking in the mind.

107
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:52,009
Truth?

108
00:07:52,134 --> 00:07:54,134
Those who fail
to prevent injustice

109
00:07:54,259 --> 00:07:57,801
are as guilty
as the perpetrator.

110
00:07:57,926 --> 00:08:00,300
It's a message...

111
00:08:00,425 --> 00:08:02,300
to us.

112
00:08:08,634 --> 00:08:11,843
Evidence... John Cree case.

113
00:08:11,968 --> 00:08:13,801
The poisoning.

114
00:08:13,926 --> 00:08:15,008
You've had quite a week.

115
00:08:15,134 --> 00:08:16,592
First the Limehouse Golem,
now this.

116
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:24,300
I heard Inspector Kildare
was asking after you.

117
00:08:24,425 --> 00:08:25,843
Yes.

118
00:08:25,968 --> 00:08:28,300
I don't know what he wanted.
I keep missing him.

119
00:08:28,425 --> 00:08:31,801
Well, they did right giving him
the Golem case, I reckon.

120
00:08:31,926 --> 00:08:34,300
He'd have risen well
above Roberts by now

121
00:08:34,425 --> 00:08:37,134
if those rumors
hadn't done for him.

122
00:08:37,259 --> 00:08:38,634
You know.

123
00:08:38,759 --> 00:08:40,425
That he wasn't
the marrying kind...

124
00:08:43,592 --> 00:08:44,759
Men.

125
00:08:45,926 --> 00:08:49,592
Oh, it's before your time,
I suppose.

126
00:08:57,926 --> 00:08:59,467
Come in.

127
00:09:01,425 --> 00:09:02,967
I got your message, sir.

128
00:09:03,092 --> 00:09:05,634
I'm being assigned a constable.

129
00:09:05,759 --> 00:09:07,610
I thought someone of
your knowledge of Limehouse

130
00:09:07,634 --> 00:09:08,801
might be an asset.

131
00:09:08,926 --> 00:09:10,134
When I heard nothing back,

132
00:09:10,259 --> 00:09:11,568
I thought perhaps
the offer didn't appeal.

133
00:09:11,592 --> 00:09:14,300
I came by twice, sir.
You were out.

134
00:09:14,425 --> 00:09:17,300
I was at Limehouse.
Appealing for witnesses.

135
00:09:17,425 --> 00:09:19,134
To no avail.

136
00:09:24,592 --> 00:09:26,634
- What are you looking for?
- I'm just looking.

137
00:09:26,759 --> 00:09:28,300
Trying to understand.

138
00:09:28,425 --> 00:09:30,134
The Golem's a madman.

139
00:09:30,259 --> 00:09:31,276
What else is there
to be understood?

140
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:33,300
Even madness has its own logic.

141
00:09:33,425 --> 00:09:34,843
Here there's none.

142
00:09:34,967 --> 00:09:37,300
At Ratcliffe Highway,
he slaughtered a household.

143
00:09:37,425 --> 00:09:39,801
The previous week,
a prostitute. Alice Stanton.

144
00:09:39,925 --> 00:09:41,300
Before that, Solomon Weil.

145
00:09:41,425 --> 00:09:44,259
He was an old man,
a... a scholar.

146
00:09:46,967 --> 00:09:48,801
Oh, my God.

147
00:09:48,925 --> 00:09:51,467
- Is that his...
- Yes.

148
00:09:51,592 --> 00:09:54,843
Laid upon the open pages
of a book on Jewish folklore,

149
00:09:54,967 --> 00:09:56,300
like a bookmark.

150
00:09:58,092 --> 00:10:00,634
"The Legend of the Golem."

151
00:10:00,759 --> 00:10:02,068
Is that how the press
got the name?

152
00:10:02,092 --> 00:10:03,967
Our murderer obviously approved.

153
00:10:04,092 --> 00:10:05,300
And who were the first two?

154
00:10:05,425 --> 00:10:06,634
Both women of the streets.

155
00:10:06,759 --> 00:10:08,634
I do remember reading
of that one.

156
00:10:08,759 --> 00:10:13,467
- "Old Salty."
- Her name was Jane Quig.

157
00:10:13,592 --> 00:10:16,134
The point is there's no story
to any of them.

158
00:10:16,259 --> 00:10:19,509
Men, women, young, old. Jew
and Christian. Rich and poor.

159
00:10:19,634 --> 00:10:20,843
Perhaps he just likes to kill.

160
00:10:20,967 --> 00:10:22,967
No.

161
00:10:23,092 --> 00:10:25,801
I'll wager there's
a tale being told.

162
00:10:25,925 --> 00:10:30,967
If we can sink to his circle
of damnation to comprehend it.

163
00:10:31,092 --> 00:10:32,967
If I may say, sir,

164
00:10:33,092 --> 00:10:34,943
seems you've been wasted
down in theft-and-fraud.

165
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:36,634
Oh, I'll be back there
soon enough,

166
00:10:36,759 --> 00:10:38,735
if the Golem strikes again.
That seems to be the plan.

167
00:10:38,759 --> 00:10:40,008
What do you mean?

168
00:10:40,134 --> 00:10:42,467
The Yard is setting me up
as a scapegoat.

169
00:10:42,592 --> 00:10:44,300
They'll not risk Roberts,
will they?

170
00:10:44,425 --> 00:10:45,967
I'm expendable.

171
00:10:46,092 --> 00:10:48,509
They get to preserve the
reputation of their golden boy

172
00:10:48,634 --> 00:10:51,843
and the public...

173
00:10:51,967 --> 00:10:53,175
get blood.

174
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:55,134
Well, as I said
back in Limehouse...

175
00:10:55,259 --> 00:10:57,467
seems they never have
their fill of that.

176
00:10:57,592 --> 00:11:00,175
"He who spectates."
He doesn't mean us.

177
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:01,676
He means the public.

178
00:11:01,801 --> 00:11:05,634
The public want blood.
The Golem provides it.

179
00:11:05,759 --> 00:11:07,300
Yes!

180
00:11:07,425 --> 00:11:08,967
I'm sure that must be it, sir.

181
00:11:09,092 --> 00:11:10,175
Are you?

182
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:12,509
I'm not.

183
00:11:12,634 --> 00:11:15,634
Do you feel like a walk
to the library?

184
00:11:25,759 --> 00:11:29,467
Ah! That quotation.
About the gladiatorial ring?

185
00:11:29,592 --> 00:11:31,801
The guilt of the audience
who seek bloodshed?

186
00:11:31,925 --> 00:11:33,676
Well, perhaps
you read it elsewhere.

187
00:11:33,801 --> 00:11:36,801
It's quoted in an old piece by
the essayist Thomas De Quincey.

188
00:11:36,925 --> 00:11:38,568
One I imagine might be
of interest to a man

189
00:11:38,592 --> 00:11:40,068
- in your line of work.
- What's the piece?

190
00:11:40,092 --> 00:11:42,967
"On Murder Considered
as One of the Fine Arts."

191
00:11:43,092 --> 00:11:46,925
A satire about the Ratcliffe
Highway killings of 1811.

192
00:11:48,759 --> 00:11:51,134
Should we talk with
this De Quincey?

193
00:11:51,259 --> 00:11:53,509
He has been dead for 20 years,
Flood,

194
00:11:53,634 --> 00:11:55,425
so it might be a bit...

195
00:12:04,925 --> 00:12:06,134
What is it?

196
00:12:11,259 --> 00:12:12,134
Left to rot.

197
00:12:12,259 --> 00:12:14,342
To kill a whore.

198
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:41,008
Who last borrowed this book?

199
00:12:41,134 --> 00:12:43,967
This is a reading room,
Inspector, not a local library.

200
00:12:44,092 --> 00:12:45,342
So nothing leaves the premises?

201
00:12:45,467 --> 00:12:47,300
Do you keep
an attendance record?

202
00:12:47,425 --> 00:12:49,303
Of course, but there's
no earthly way of knowing

203
00:12:49,425 --> 00:12:51,134
what anyone read
or when they read it!

204
00:12:51,259 --> 00:12:53,634
Who was here
on September the 24th?

205
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,300
There were four men in
the reading room that day. Why?

206
00:12:59,425 --> 00:13:01,276
It's the final entry in a diary
someone has kept

207
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:02,676
in the pages of this book.

208
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,610
- Were you here yourself?
- I'm here every day.

209
00:13:04,634 --> 00:13:06,712
Then I must ask you for
a sample of your handwriting.

210
00:13:06,758 --> 00:13:08,300
I'll need the same
from all the staff.

211
00:13:08,425 --> 00:13:09,800
And those four names, please?

212
00:13:09,925 --> 00:13:12,509
The Dan Leno?

213
00:13:12,634 --> 00:13:15,634
And the Karl Marx
and George Gissing.

214
00:13:15,758 --> 00:13:18,175
If you're a follower
of philosophy and literature.

215
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:21,134
What do you know of John Cree?

216
00:13:21,259 --> 00:13:23,134
Sir?

217
00:13:23,259 --> 00:13:26,967
If he's the same John Cree
I'm thinking of...

218
00:13:27,092 --> 00:13:28,467
I believe he's dead.

219
00:13:33,758 --> 00:13:36,300
Place the diary in my files.
Keep it safe.

220
00:13:36,425 --> 00:13:38,300
Find out all you can about
George Gissing,

221
00:13:38,425 --> 00:13:40,300
Karl Marx, and Dan Leno.

222
00:13:40,425 --> 00:13:41,467
Where are you going?

223
00:13:41,592 --> 00:13:43,342
To investigate the dead man.

224
00:13:43,467 --> 00:13:45,967
If he was the Golem,
London's troubles are over.

225
00:13:52,092 --> 00:13:53,842
And you describe your husband

226
00:13:53,967 --> 00:13:57,300
as being in a state of despair

227
00:13:57,425 --> 00:14:00,800
in the weeks leading
to his death, yes?

228
00:14:00,925 --> 00:14:02,235
My husband
had spent several years

229
00:14:02,259 --> 00:14:03,342
writing a play, Your Honor.

230
00:14:03,467 --> 00:14:05,634
Entitled "Misery Junction."

231
00:14:05,758 --> 00:14:08,300
It was... not a success.

232
00:14:08,425 --> 00:14:10,134
I believe he never
recovered from that.

233
00:14:10,259 --> 00:14:14,634
And yet he continued to pass
each day in the reading room

234
00:14:14,758 --> 00:14:16,467
at the British Museum,

235
00:14:16,592 --> 00:14:18,300
reading and writing.

236
00:14:18,425 --> 00:14:20,610
A change in mood and a change in
habit are two different things.

237
00:14:20,634 --> 00:14:22,342
On the day of his death,

238
00:14:22,467 --> 00:14:25,008
the librarian described
your husband

239
00:14:25,134 --> 00:14:28,467
as being in good spirits.

240
00:14:28,592 --> 00:14:30,008
My husband was adept
at presenting

241
00:14:30,134 --> 00:14:31,509
a false face to the world, sir.

242
00:14:31,633 --> 00:14:35,633
And that is something
you would understand,

243
00:14:35,758 --> 00:14:38,967
is it not, Mrs. Cree?

244
00:14:39,092 --> 00:14:41,509
Playing...

245
00:14:41,633 --> 00:14:43,175
a role?

246
00:14:44,633 --> 00:14:46,134
I used to be
a music hall performer,

247
00:14:46,259 --> 00:14:48,134
if that's what you mean.

248
00:14:48,259 --> 00:14:50,068
And what of the role
you play today before this court?

249
00:14:50,092 --> 00:14:54,967
That of a respectable,
educated lady.

250
00:14:55,092 --> 00:14:58,800
You were born out of wedlock,
were you not?

251
00:14:58,925 --> 00:15:00,967
Yes, sir.

252
00:15:01,092 --> 00:15:05,967
As a child,
you stitched sailcloth

253
00:15:06,092 --> 00:15:09,800
and passed much time with men.

254
00:15:12,925 --> 00:15:15,633
I can assure you I was
a God-fearing child.

255
00:15:15,758 --> 00:15:17,467
An innocent.

256
00:15:17,591 --> 00:15:20,842
I was tasked by my mother to
deliver our sails to the docks.

257
00:15:20,967 --> 00:15:23,467
Encountering men was not
something I could hope to avoid.

258
00:15:23,591 --> 00:15:24,967
Here you go, good as new.

259
00:15:25,092 --> 00:15:26,300
Carry that all the way?

260
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:28,008
Look at your poor hands, Lizzie.

261
00:15:28,134 --> 00:15:30,068
Me ma says I'm made for
the bloodtubs with these hands.

262
00:15:30,092 --> 00:15:32,342
Don't you dare run off
and join the theater.

263
00:15:32,467 --> 00:15:34,134
These sails ain't
gonna mend themselves.

264
00:15:34,259 --> 00:15:35,633
I like the comics.

265
00:15:35,758 --> 00:15:38,134
Charlie's gonna take me
to see Dan Leno one day.

266
00:15:38,259 --> 00:15:40,342
Aren't you, Charlie,
when I'm older?

267
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:46,134
♪ The guards and the porters
came round her by score ♪

268
00:15:46,259 --> 00:15:47,675
♪ And she told them all ♪

269
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,800
♪ She'd never had her ticket
punched before ♪

270
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:54,776
Dan Leno was never that blue.

271
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,300
Did Charlie teach you that?

272
00:15:56,425 --> 00:15:58,633
Just don't let your ma hear it.
She'll kill ya.

273
00:15:58,758 --> 00:16:01,633
What's it mean?

274
00:16:01,758 --> 00:16:03,800
If you want, I'll show you.

275
00:16:03,925 --> 00:16:05,509
Me mum will be wanting me home,

276
00:16:05,633 --> 00:16:08,175
if you'll give me our pay.

277
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,675
Money's in my hut.

278
00:16:23,591 --> 00:16:26,092
What took you so long?

279
00:16:34,092 --> 00:16:36,967
Has a man laid hands on you?

280
00:16:37,092 --> 00:16:38,633
You liar.

281
00:16:38,758 --> 00:16:40,508
I fell.

282
00:16:40,633 --> 00:16:42,342
Come here.

283
00:16:44,633 --> 00:16:45,967
What did I do wrong?

284
00:16:46,092 --> 00:16:47,800
Mother, no, please.

285
00:16:47,925 --> 00:16:49,300
Did I not teach you well enough?

286
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:53,300
No, I beg you!

287
00:16:53,425 --> 00:16:54,633
Come here.

288
00:16:59,925 --> 00:17:02,134
You want me to go
to heaven, don't you?

289
00:17:02,259 --> 00:17:04,467
That place will keep you
from heaven, Lizzie.

290
00:17:11,967 --> 00:17:13,633
That is enough, Mrs. Cree!

291
00:17:18,758 --> 00:17:21,134
Court is adjourned for lunch!

292
00:17:29,092 --> 00:17:30,967
Anyone come by
from The Era newspaper?

293
00:17:31,092 --> 00:17:32,466
I'm expecting a package.

294
00:17:32,591 --> 00:17:33,591
No package.

295
00:17:35,134 --> 00:17:37,092
Just this.

296
00:17:43,259 --> 00:17:45,259
John Cree.

297
00:17:48,425 --> 00:17:50,508
No luck getting a sample
of Cree's handwriting

298
00:17:50,633 --> 00:17:53,134
from his old employers,
I'm afraid, sir.

299
00:17:53,259 --> 00:17:55,967
They don't keep
reporters' submissions.

300
00:17:56,092 --> 00:17:57,800
Had a more recent
portrait, though.

301
00:17:57,925 --> 00:18:00,466
And I've asked archives for all
the files on Gissing and Marx.

302
00:18:00,591 --> 00:18:03,800
Very good. See if
they have anything on Leno.

303
00:18:19,967 --> 00:18:23,134
September the 5th, 1880.

304
00:18:23,259 --> 00:18:25,300
It was a fine bright evening...

305
00:18:25,424 --> 00:18:28,134
And I could feel
a murder coming on.

306
00:18:28,259 --> 00:18:31,300
Since it was to be
my first show,

307
00:18:31,424 --> 00:18:34,800
I decided by way of inspiration
to pay a visit to the site

308
00:18:34,925 --> 00:18:37,633
of the immortal
Ratcliffe Highway murders.

309
00:18:37,758 --> 00:18:40,466
More than half a century ago
on this sacred spot,

310
00:18:40,591 --> 00:18:43,508
an entire family was
dispatched into eternity

311
00:18:43,633 --> 00:18:45,967
by a man named John Williams,

312
00:18:46,092 --> 00:18:47,800
a man Thomas De Quincey
described

313
00:18:47,925 --> 00:18:50,508
as an artist of exquisite skill.

314
00:18:50,633 --> 00:18:53,633
And yet now the site
of his greatest work was defiled

315
00:18:53,758 --> 00:18:56,342
by a seller
of secondhand clothes.

316
00:18:56,466 --> 00:18:59,800
We're closed, I'm afraid, sir.

317
00:18:59,925 --> 00:19:01,342
Oh, sorry.

318
00:19:01,466 --> 00:19:03,466
The door was open.

319
00:19:03,591 --> 00:19:04,633
No matter.

320
00:19:04,758 --> 00:19:08,134
I'll be sure to return.

321
00:19:08,259 --> 00:19:11,466
But I was
a beginner, an understudy.

322
00:19:11,591 --> 00:19:14,466
Not yet ready
for the great stage.

323
00:19:26,591 --> 00:19:30,008
An artist must
perfect his craft,

324
00:19:30,134 --> 00:19:33,633
and tonight I would start
with a small, private rehearsal.

325
00:19:33,758 --> 00:19:35,134
Gin?

326
00:19:35,259 --> 00:19:37,341
Don't you think
you've had enough?

327
00:19:37,466 --> 00:19:39,300
I want you awake.

328
00:19:39,424 --> 00:19:41,633
Or else you'll miss all the fun.

329
00:20:03,424 --> 00:20:05,967
I felt that she
suspected my game from the start

330
00:20:06,092 --> 00:20:07,800
and offered herself willingly,

331
00:20:07,925 --> 00:20:09,633
warm in the knowledge
that the world

332
00:20:09,758 --> 00:20:12,675
would soon be forced to confront
the plight of her kind.

333
00:20:21,092 --> 00:20:22,299
I took out her eyes in case

334
00:20:22,424 --> 00:20:24,466
my image had been
imprinted upon them,

335
00:20:24,591 --> 00:20:26,400
and washed the blood
from my hands with the gin

336
00:20:26,424 --> 00:20:28,341
in her chamber pot.

337
00:20:28,466 --> 00:20:32,842
My first performance
was complete.

338
00:20:53,424 --> 00:20:58,466
Mrs. Cree? I'm Inspector Kildare
of Scotland Yard.

339
00:20:58,591 --> 00:20:59,943
I suppose you're here
to chastise me

340
00:20:59,967 --> 00:21:01,967
for my candor in court.
On the contrary,

341
00:21:02,092 --> 00:21:03,675
I applaud you for it.

342
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,466
It's all too easy
to imagine that those

343
00:21:05,591 --> 00:21:06,800
who have enjoyed success

344
00:21:06,925 --> 00:21:09,466
have never known suffering.

345
00:21:09,591 --> 00:21:12,800
Well, to quote the great
Dan Leno, "Here we are again."

346
00:21:12,925 --> 00:21:16,675
I'm afraid I'm not a frequenter
of the music halls.

347
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,800
He portrays
the suffering of women.

348
00:21:18,925 --> 00:21:20,800
My gender becomes
inured to injustice.

349
00:21:20,925 --> 00:21:22,466
We expect it.

350
00:21:22,591 --> 00:21:24,800
Until we can greet it
merely with a shrug.

351
00:21:24,925 --> 00:21:27,967
Oh.
I understood he was a comic.

352
00:21:28,092 --> 00:21:32,466
The line between comedy
and tragedy is a fine one.

353
00:21:32,591 --> 00:21:34,591
You haven't told me
why you're here.

354
00:21:38,424 --> 00:21:41,508
I wish to put it to you that
I know why you might have had

355
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:43,633
good reason
to poison your husband.

356
00:21:43,758 --> 00:21:45,633
Please, sir, I'm hoarse
from repetition.

357
00:21:45,758 --> 00:21:47,734
There will be no confession.
My plea has been made.

358
00:21:47,758 --> 00:21:51,008
Mrs. Cree, I'm not
assigned to your case.

359
00:21:51,134 --> 00:21:54,466
I'm here because your husband
is a suspect in...

360
00:21:54,591 --> 00:21:55,800
another matter.

361
00:21:55,925 --> 00:21:59,633
What matter?

362
00:21:59,758 --> 00:22:02,299
A journal has been found.

363
00:22:02,424 --> 00:22:04,299
I'd like to compare
the handwriting with his.

364
00:22:04,424 --> 00:22:06,633
Might you have anything
that he wrote?

365
00:22:06,758 --> 00:22:08,633
- His papers...
- He burned them, yes.

366
00:22:08,758 --> 00:22:13,633
Mrs. Cree, if your husband were
found to have committed murder,

367
00:22:13,758 --> 00:22:16,299
your claims of suicide
gain weight.

368
00:22:16,424 --> 00:22:17,967
Do you understand?
You could go free.

369
00:22:18,092 --> 00:22:19,174
Murder?

370
00:22:19,299 --> 00:22:21,466
I'm investigating
a series of deaths.

371
00:22:21,591 --> 00:22:23,567
They're calling them
the "Limehouse Golem" murders.

372
00:22:23,591 --> 00:22:25,901
You can't honestly think my
husband capable of such things?

373
00:22:25,925 --> 00:22:28,633
It's not my place
to have an opinion.

374
00:22:28,758 --> 00:22:30,675
I just follow the threads.

375
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:33,299
The newspaper said it was
your first murder case.

376
00:22:33,424 --> 00:22:35,134
That's a rotten kind
of chance to be given.

377
00:22:35,258 --> 00:22:38,800
Excuse me?

378
00:22:38,925 --> 00:22:41,633
I wanted to be
a serious actress, you know.

379
00:22:41,758 --> 00:22:43,842
Had my chance once, too.

380
00:22:43,967 --> 00:22:45,800
They don't give you another.

381
00:22:48,925 --> 00:22:51,967
That's why I'd like to help you.

382
00:22:52,092 --> 00:22:53,633
You needn't feign
interest in me.

383
00:22:53,758 --> 00:22:56,967
There's nothing
feigned about it.

384
00:22:57,092 --> 00:23:00,842
Raised in cruelty and yet
you stood tall and thrived.

385
00:23:00,967 --> 00:23:03,299
That's...

386
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:04,758
uncommon.

387
00:23:09,092 --> 00:23:11,800
My mother did me the great
service of dying young.

388
00:23:16,258 --> 00:23:18,466
I was raised in the music halls.

389
00:24:13,258 --> 00:24:14,800
You want to buy some sweets,
miss?

390
00:24:14,925 --> 00:24:16,133
Hey, get out of here.

391
00:24:26,258 --> 00:24:27,800
What?

392
00:24:27,925 --> 00:24:31,466
- What a play.
- It was.

393
00:24:45,424 --> 00:24:46,508
It's halfway over, love.

394
00:24:46,633 --> 00:24:48,174
Come back tomorrow.

395
00:24:50,424 --> 00:24:52,675
All right. Go on in.

396
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:54,466
You can still catch Leno
if you're quick.

397
00:24:54,591 --> 00:24:56,007
God bless.

398
00:25:29,925 --> 00:25:31,466
All right, there we go!

399
00:25:33,424 --> 00:25:36,633
Ah!
What fine manners.

400
00:25:36,758 --> 00:25:38,800
Such fine manners!

401
00:25:38,925 --> 00:25:40,633
I feel as if I'm at a tea party.

402
00:25:40,758 --> 00:25:45,299
Please note the oxtail in the
jelly tonight is three pence.

403
00:25:45,424 --> 00:25:46,675
- Now...
- That's for later.

404
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:48,109
Without any further ado,

405
00:25:48,133 --> 00:25:50,633
may I introduce
the man of the hour,

406
00:25:50,758 --> 00:25:53,842
Mr. Dan Leno!

407
00:26:02,633 --> 00:26:05,133

Pies, pies, pies, pies.

431
00:28:00,424 --> 00:28:03,133
All in dire need of pies.
I'll tell you what, dearie.

432
00:28:03,258 --> 00:28:05,133
Seeing as you're here again,
be a good girl.

433
00:28:05,258 --> 00:28:06,966
Give Uncle a hand.

434
00:28:07,091 --> 00:28:09,466
Be careful with that.
All too good to drop.

435
00:28:09,591 --> 00:28:11,299
As the pregnant woman
said to the midwife!

436
00:28:13,924 --> 00:28:15,299
Here you are, Vic.

437
00:28:15,424 --> 00:28:16,900
- A little bit of what you fancy.
- Ooh, pie.

438
00:28:16,924 --> 00:28:19,633
John John.

439
00:28:19,758 --> 00:28:23,174
Aveline, dear, nice and hot,
just as you like it.

440
00:28:23,299 --> 00:28:26,966
But not quite so big.

441
00:28:27,091 --> 00:28:28,966
Thanks, Uncle.

442
00:28:42,424 --> 00:28:45,299
Last one's for you, Mr. Leno.

443
00:28:45,424 --> 00:28:47,341
Mr. Leno, is it?

444
00:28:47,466 --> 00:28:50,133
Did you find her at the grocers,
Uncle?

445
00:28:50,258 --> 00:28:52,299
She's certainly a green one.

446
00:28:52,424 --> 00:28:56,133
Now, now, girls.

447
00:28:56,258 --> 00:28:58,633
- What's your name?
- Lizzie, sir.

448
00:28:58,758 --> 00:29:01,133
Lambeth Marsh Lizzie.

449
00:29:01,258 --> 00:29:03,633
I thought I could
smell marsh gas.

450
00:29:03,757 --> 00:29:06,133
Oh, don't let 'em dumb you.
It's just their way.

451
00:29:06,258 --> 00:29:08,466
And call me Dan.

452
00:29:08,591 --> 00:29:09,966
This is Tommy Farr,

453
00:29:10,091 --> 00:29:13,299
theater manager
and keeper of the bunce.

454
00:29:13,424 --> 00:29:15,841
Speaking of which, we owe you
something for your trouble.

455
00:29:20,424 --> 00:29:22,633
What in God's name did
they have you doing down there

456
00:29:22,757 --> 00:29:24,508
in those marshes?

457
00:29:26,299 --> 00:29:28,133
Digging graves.

458
00:29:28,258 --> 00:29:29,799
Five years it was
before I found out

459
00:29:29,924 --> 00:29:32,466
you're supposed to use a shovel.

460
00:29:32,591 --> 00:29:34,174
I like this one.

461
00:29:34,299 --> 00:29:35,466
Can you read?

462
00:29:35,591 --> 00:29:36,841
Like a native.

463
00:29:36,966 --> 00:29:38,757
Here.

464
00:29:43,757 --> 00:29:45,133
"What's fame?"

465
00:29:45,258 --> 00:29:47,508
A fancy'd life
in other's breath.

466
00:29:47,633 --> 00:29:50,966
A thing beyond us,
even before our death.

467
00:29:51,091 --> 00:29:53,799
All we feel of it begins
and ends in the small circle

468
00:29:53,924 --> 00:29:57,007
"of our foes and friends."

469
00:29:57,133 --> 00:29:59,633
That's my favorite line.

470
00:29:59,757 --> 00:30:02,633
Alexander Pope.

471
00:30:02,757 --> 00:30:04,133
Are you looking for work,
Lizzie?

472
00:30:04,258 --> 00:30:05,675
Yeah.

473
00:30:05,799 --> 00:30:08,299
Only, our prompter ran off
with a Lion Comique.

474
00:30:08,424 --> 00:30:09,633
And it won't all be lavender.

475
00:30:09,757 --> 00:30:10,942
There'll be some
fetch and carry,

476
00:30:10,966 --> 00:30:12,466
but there's decent bunce

477
00:30:12,591 --> 00:30:16,466
and room in the digs
with the dancers.

478
00:30:16,591 --> 00:30:19,133
What do you say?

479
00:30:19,258 --> 00:30:25,174
How would you describe
your relationship with Dan Leno?

480
00:30:25,299 --> 00:30:26,633
We were friends, sir.

481
00:30:26,757 --> 00:30:29,466
And he was... my mentor.

482
00:30:29,591 --> 00:30:31,133
He took me under his wing.

483
00:30:31,258 --> 00:30:33,466
"No, Mrs. Killian"...

484
00:30:36,299 --> 00:30:37,966
Where did you learn
to read and write

485
00:30:38,091 --> 00:30:39,841
if you didn't go to school?

486
00:30:39,966 --> 00:30:43,633
My mother's Bible, I suppose.

487
00:30:45,466 --> 00:30:47,966
Oh, and speaking of books...

488
00:30:48,091 --> 00:30:49,674
Oi.

489
00:30:49,799 --> 00:30:51,299
- Thank you.
- What?

490
00:30:51,424 --> 00:30:52,966
Finished already?

491
00:30:53,091 --> 00:30:54,966
That's the second this week!

492
00:30:57,091 --> 00:30:59,508
I think books might be
my first love.

493
00:30:59,633 --> 00:31:04,007
And I've always heard it said
that first love is insatiable.

494
00:31:04,133 --> 00:31:05,966
Sod writing new gags,

495
00:31:06,091 --> 00:31:08,632
they can have the Milkmaid again
tonight and like it.

496
00:31:08,757 --> 00:31:11,799
I want to show you something.

497
00:31:11,924 --> 00:31:13,174
Where are we going?

498
00:31:13,299 --> 00:31:14,466
You'll see.

499
00:31:17,966 --> 00:31:19,966
A whole room?

500
00:31:20,091 --> 00:31:22,341
Full of books?

501
00:31:22,466 --> 00:31:24,258
Every inch of it.

502
00:31:27,091 --> 00:31:28,400
People come here just to read?

503
00:31:28,424 --> 00:31:32,133
To read. To learn. To create.

504
00:31:32,258 --> 00:31:35,299
It's like... a great furnace.

505
00:31:35,424 --> 00:31:38,632
I mean, the future
is being forged here.

506
00:31:38,757 --> 00:31:42,966
Writers, philosophers,
men of science.

507
00:31:43,091 --> 00:31:45,674
All the way down
to lowly clowns like me.

508
00:31:45,799 --> 00:31:48,674
The ladies' table is upstairs.

509
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:52,299
Oh, thanking you
kindly, good sir.

510
00:31:52,424 --> 00:31:54,632
You were never
more than friends?

511
00:31:54,757 --> 00:31:56,133
No, sir.

512
00:31:56,258 --> 00:31:59,799
I believe he felt
protective of me.

513
00:31:59,924 --> 00:32:02,299
The prosecution wishes
to remind the court

514
00:32:02,424 --> 00:32:04,466
that Mr. Leno
was recently questioned

515
00:32:04,590 --> 00:32:08,133
in connection with
the "Limehouse Golem" murders.

516
00:32:08,258 --> 00:32:09,400
Objection, Your Honor!

517
00:32:10,924 --> 00:32:12,403
Order, order!

518
00:32:15,757 --> 00:32:17,466
Inspector Kildare!

519
00:32:17,590 --> 00:32:19,466
Kildare!

520
00:32:28,757 --> 00:32:30,632
Why was I not aware

521
00:32:30,757 --> 00:32:32,799
that Dan Leno
was previously a suspect?

522
00:32:32,924 --> 00:32:34,674
You tell me, Kildare.

523
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:36,466
It was in every daily newspaper.

524
00:32:36,590 --> 00:32:39,007
But not in the brief
you gave me.

525
00:32:39,133 --> 00:32:41,133
Well, he was eliminated
from inquiries.

526
00:32:41,258 --> 00:32:42,966
The, uh, report's
on my desk somewhere.

527
00:32:43,091 --> 00:32:46,632
You didn't think to place
it in your files?

528
00:32:46,757 --> 00:32:49,341
The streets of London
run red with blood,

529
00:32:49,466 --> 00:32:53,799
and you concern yourself
with paperwork?

530
00:32:53,924 --> 00:32:56,508
You'd have made
a fine politician, Kildare,

531
00:32:56,632 --> 00:32:59,632
were you not
the topic of such...

532
00:32:59,757 --> 00:33:01,258
speculation.

533
00:33:06,424 --> 00:33:07,966
I wouldn't read that.

534
00:33:08,091 --> 00:33:10,341
Disgraceful lies, all of it.

535
00:33:10,466 --> 00:33:12,966
The poor woman spoke
of misfortune and cruelty

536
00:33:13,091 --> 00:33:14,507
and they've turned it upon her.

537
00:33:14,632 --> 00:33:16,966
Makes my blood boil.

538
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:21,174
Seems your beloved Leno
wasn't actually a suspect.

539
00:33:21,299 --> 00:33:22,799
My beloved?

540
00:33:22,924 --> 00:33:24,466
What man doesn't enjoy Dan Leno?

541
00:33:24,590 --> 00:33:26,632
One who doesn't care
for the music halls?

542
00:33:26,757 --> 00:33:30,299
Well, I'll venture to say you've
not seen the right shows, sir.

543
00:33:30,424 --> 00:33:32,133
If you ever wish
for a recommendation...

544
00:33:32,258 --> 00:33:36,466
He was questioned in regard
to Alice Stanton's gown.

545
00:33:36,590 --> 00:33:39,632
A label sewn into it
identified it as his,

546
00:33:39,757 --> 00:33:42,299
a stage costume.
So he knew her?

547
00:33:42,424 --> 00:33:44,109
"Leno stated that
the dress was part"

548
00:33:44,133 --> 00:33:45,841
of a consignment
of stage costumes

549
00:33:45,966 --> 00:33:47,133
he'd sold a year earlier

550
00:33:47,258 --> 00:33:48,799
"to a purveyor of
secondhand clothes."

551
00:33:48,924 --> 00:33:50,775
And apparently he provided
a receipt which proved it.

552
00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:52,275
Well, then it was merely
a coincidence.

553
00:33:52,299 --> 00:33:54,299
Perhaps.

554
00:33:54,424 --> 00:33:56,007
As is perhaps the fact

555
00:33:56,133 --> 00:33:58,133
that the purveyor of
secondhand clothes

556
00:33:58,258 --> 00:34:01,632
was the late Mr. Gerrard,

557
00:34:01,757 --> 00:34:03,632
murdered at Ratcliffe Highway.

558
00:34:03,757 --> 00:34:05,341
We should get a sample
of his hand.

559
00:34:05,465 --> 00:34:07,442
Quite. And can we find out
what's happened to that dress?

560
00:34:07,465 --> 00:34:08,900
It wasn't with the rest
of the evidence.

561
00:34:08,924 --> 00:34:10,465
I'll look into it, sir.

562
00:34:20,966 --> 00:34:22,966
Why didn't you tell me
you questioned Dan Leno?

563
00:34:23,091 --> 00:34:24,674
I haven't.
Though I shall have to.

564
00:34:24,799 --> 00:34:25,966
In court they said you had.

565
00:34:26,091 --> 00:34:29,341
Not me.
Before I joined the case.

566
00:34:29,465 --> 00:34:33,174
So is he a suspect or not?

567
00:34:33,299 --> 00:34:34,632
Do you think he should be?

568
00:34:34,757 --> 00:34:36,133
Please don't play games with me.

569
00:34:36,258 --> 00:34:37,674
I have no desire to!

570
00:34:37,799 --> 00:34:39,465
The Golem is still at large.

571
00:34:39,590 --> 00:34:42,133
Wasting my time
could cost lives.

572
00:34:47,757 --> 00:34:50,007
Unless you are correct
about my husband.

573
00:34:50,133 --> 00:34:52,632
If the Golem is no more,
then none are at risk.

574
00:34:54,757 --> 00:34:57,133
Besides yours...

575
00:34:57,258 --> 00:35:02,299
You needn't hang, Mrs. Cree.

576
00:35:02,423 --> 00:35:04,799
Please call me Lizzie.

577
00:35:06,299 --> 00:35:08,632
Just assist me in assisting you.

578
00:35:08,757 --> 00:35:10,174
I can't tell you
what I don't know.

579
00:35:10,299 --> 00:35:13,423
All I ask is that you
tell me what you do.

580
00:35:15,924 --> 00:35:17,341
Where should I start?

581
00:35:17,465 --> 00:35:21,465
How you came to know
John Cree, perhaps.

582
00:35:23,757 --> 00:35:25,507
Jim is very partial to me!

583
00:35:25,632 --> 00:35:27,133
Though never a word has he said.

584
00:35:27,258 --> 00:35:29,507
Right now he's lodging
with Mrs. Kelly.

585
00:35:29,632 --> 00:35:30,841
Do you know Mrs. Kelly?

586
00:35:30,966 --> 00:35:33,133
Don't you know Mrs. Kelly?

587
00:35:33,258 --> 00:35:35,174
Good life-a-mighty,
don't look so simple.

588
00:35:35,299 --> 00:35:37,341
Everybody knows Mrs. Kelly.

589
00:35:37,465 --> 00:35:39,067
Am I... Am I going too fast
for you, love?

590
00:35:39,091 --> 00:35:40,299
You spoof it, I'll write it.

591
00:35:40,423 --> 00:35:41,799
Oh, she's a mean one,
Mrs. Kelly.

592
00:35:41,924 --> 00:35:43,109
She'll buy half a dozen oysters

593
00:35:43,133 --> 00:35:44,234
and eat them
in front of a mirror

594
00:35:44,258 --> 00:35:46,341
to make them look like a dozen.

595
00:35:46,465 --> 00:35:48,007
What about...

596
00:35:48,133 --> 00:35:51,299
"I saw her take a coin
from her purse the other day,"

597
00:35:51,423 --> 00:35:52,674
and I swear,

598
00:35:52,799 --> 00:35:54,299
I saw Queen Victoria blinking

599
00:35:54,423 --> 00:35:55,674
at the sight of sunlight"?

600
00:35:58,258 --> 00:36:00,340
Are those petticoats ironed yet?

601
00:36:00,465 --> 00:36:01,841
Good.

602
00:36:01,966 --> 00:36:05,133
Then you can come over here
and lace me up.

603
00:36:10,091 --> 00:36:11,632
Fuck off, Victor.

604
00:36:11,757 --> 00:36:12,966
Come on, dear.

605
00:36:13,091 --> 00:36:14,799
You know I can't see
from the back row,

606
00:36:14,924 --> 00:36:16,299
and I do so love a double act.

607
00:36:16,423 --> 00:36:18,007
Victor, out, out!

608
00:36:18,133 --> 00:36:20,133
- Come on.
- Just a joke, Dan.

609
00:36:20,258 --> 00:36:23,007
Get that, will you, Lizzie.

610
00:36:23,133 --> 00:36:25,632
That'll be the reporter
for my interview.

611
00:36:26,966 --> 00:36:28,632
Hmm, you're new.

612
00:36:28,757 --> 00:36:31,340
Lizzie.
Seen you before, haven't I?

613
00:36:31,465 --> 00:36:32,841
You work for The Era.

614
00:36:32,966 --> 00:36:34,841
I'm a playwright,
but yes, indeed,

615
00:36:34,966 --> 00:36:36,340
The Era puts food on my table.

616
00:36:36,465 --> 00:36:40,133
For now.

617
00:36:40,258 --> 00:36:41,674
John Cree.

618
00:36:41,799 --> 00:36:44,799
You got to sweep it.

619
00:36:44,924 --> 00:36:46,174
Shall we?

620
00:36:46,298 --> 00:36:49,298
Can you help me dress, love?

621
00:36:49,423 --> 00:36:51,133
Threw me out the window.

622
00:36:53,423 --> 00:36:54,841
The usual for everyone?

623
00:36:54,966 --> 00:36:56,109
Oh, yes, please, darling.

624
00:36:56,133 --> 00:36:57,275
What about you, dear?

625
00:36:57,298 --> 00:36:58,632
A baked potato.

626
00:36:58,757 --> 00:37:01,133
You don't fancy a bit
of meat tonight, Lizzie?

627
00:37:01,258 --> 00:37:02,298
What's the matter, Dan?

628
00:37:02,423 --> 00:37:03,632
She must be over 16.

629
00:37:03,757 --> 00:37:04,966
No, I mustn't.

630
00:37:05,091 --> 00:37:06,966
So, Lizzie, what's your act?

631
00:37:07,091 --> 00:37:08,465
Do tell.

632
00:37:08,590 --> 00:37:11,133
Uh, it's called
"Little Lizzie the dogsbody."

633
00:37:11,258 --> 00:37:12,632
Mm-hmm.

634
00:37:12,757 --> 00:37:13,942
Yeah, I do all manner
of gags with an iron

635
00:37:13,966 --> 00:37:15,966
and a pile of dirty smalls.

636
00:37:16,091 --> 00:37:17,507
Oh, that sounds extraordinary.

637
00:37:17,632 --> 00:37:19,133
It is.

638
00:37:19,258 --> 00:37:20,966
She's dumbing you, John.

639
00:37:21,091 --> 00:37:22,966
She means she's the prompt.

640
00:37:23,091 --> 00:37:25,465
I was only saying earlier
you might make a good gagger.

641
00:37:25,590 --> 00:37:27,234
She's got the dial for it,
hasn't she, Uncle?

642
00:37:27,257 --> 00:37:28,632
Say that again.

643
00:37:28,757 --> 00:37:30,841
She's got the dial for it,
hasn't she, Uncle?

644
00:37:30,966 --> 00:37:32,799
Oh, thank you.

645
00:37:32,924 --> 00:37:34,799
I don't know where
you put it all, Victor.

646
00:37:34,924 --> 00:37:36,465
You must have hollow legs.

647
00:37:36,590 --> 00:37:39,007
I can hold as much as the next
man, thank you very much.

648
00:37:39,133 --> 00:37:41,007
Pour a quart in a pint pot,
you'll make a mess.

649
00:37:41,133 --> 00:37:43,007
Nonsense.
I'm as right as rain.

650
00:37:43,133 --> 00:37:45,507
Can't keep a good man down,
as they say,

651
00:37:45,632 --> 00:37:47,966
but I know where you can
put a good man up.

652
00:37:48,091 --> 00:37:49,340
Aah!

653
00:37:49,465 --> 00:37:51,298
What in God's name is going on?

654
00:37:51,423 --> 00:37:52,632
Nothing.

655
00:37:52,757 --> 00:37:54,632
Lizzie stepped on my foot
by mistake.

656
00:37:54,757 --> 00:37:57,465
No harm done.

657
00:37:57,590 --> 00:38:01,007
I'm taking Lizzie home.

658
00:38:01,133 --> 00:38:02,966
This is no place
for an innocent young girl.

659
00:38:03,091 --> 00:38:04,465
Come, gentlemen.
No harm done.

660
00:38:04,590 --> 00:38:05,733
As the executioner said
to the hanged man.

661
00:38:05,757 --> 00:38:06,900
I'll... I'll... I'll take her.

662
00:38:06,924 --> 00:38:08,067
There's no need.
I can walk alone.

663
00:38:08,091 --> 00:38:09,632
No, I'll not hear of it.

664
00:38:09,757 --> 00:38:11,233
Please, your food will get cold.
I'll be quite safe.

665
00:38:11,257 --> 00:38:12,566
Our digs are just
around the corner.

666
00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:15,465
Then I'll be back in good time.

667
00:38:15,590 --> 00:38:16,799
Watch yourself, Victor.

668
00:38:16,924 --> 00:38:18,298
John Cree's got a temper.

669
00:38:18,423 --> 00:38:20,465
I'm not afraid of him.

670
00:38:36,924 --> 00:38:40,174
Lizzie...

671
00:38:40,298 --> 00:38:42,799
I'm afraid there's...

672
00:38:42,924 --> 00:38:44,674
awful news.

673
00:38:44,799 --> 00:38:49,133
Victor was found at the bottom
of the stairs last night.

674
00:38:49,257 --> 00:38:51,507
Lizzie...

675
00:38:51,632 --> 00:38:54,133
are you trying to tell me
you suspected John Cree?

676
00:38:54,257 --> 00:38:56,799
I didn't say that.
I merely said he was protective.

677
00:38:56,924 --> 00:38:59,465
You said the same of Dan Leno.

678
00:38:59,590 --> 00:39:01,465
I seem to ignite the urge
in men.

679
00:39:04,133 --> 00:39:07,133
He was a terrible little turd.

680
00:39:07,257 --> 00:39:09,799
But he was our
terrible little turd.

681
00:39:09,924 --> 00:39:11,632
That's it,

682
00:39:11,757 --> 00:39:14,966
cheer up.

683
00:39:15,091 --> 00:39:17,173
I've suggested that we make

684
00:39:17,298 --> 00:39:20,966
tonight's show
a special tribute.

685
00:39:21,091 --> 00:39:23,966
We'll give him a grand send-off,

686
00:39:24,091 --> 00:39:25,340
won't we?

687
00:39:25,465 --> 00:39:27,632
Did you ever speak
of it to John?

688
00:39:27,757 --> 00:39:28,966
No.

689
00:39:29,091 --> 00:39:31,007
I never spoke of it to anyone.

690
00:39:31,132 --> 00:39:33,632
I preferred to
chalk it up to fate.

691
00:39:33,757 --> 00:39:36,036
Would you rather owe your
happiness to simple good fortune

692
00:39:36,091 --> 00:39:39,173
or to an unspeakable
act of violence?

693
00:39:39,298 --> 00:39:43,298
Little Victor's death
brought you happiness?

694
00:39:43,423 --> 00:39:45,799
Little Victor's death
gave me life.

695
00:40:06,257 --> 00:40:08,067
The people come through
the doors and they laugh.

696
00:40:08,090 --> 00:40:10,233
Dan, I was hoping you'd
wipe your ass with the papers.

697
00:40:10,257 --> 00:40:11,900
- You don't read them.
- What more can I do?

698
00:40:11,924 --> 00:40:13,632
Dan?

699
00:40:13,757 --> 00:40:17,173
Do you think I could pay my
respects to Little Victor, too?

700
00:40:17,298 --> 00:40:18,966
Good God.

701
00:40:19,090 --> 00:40:20,632
This is a funny thing.

702
00:40:20,757 --> 00:40:21,966
What a funny thing.

703
00:40:22,090 --> 00:40:23,298
Just a little song.

704
00:40:23,423 --> 00:40:25,132
A blue one maybe,
Victor would like that.

705
00:40:25,257 --> 00:40:27,632
A salty sailor act,
as if I were a man.

706
00:40:27,757 --> 00:40:29,966
- It could be a scream.
- Go on, then, Lizzie.

707
00:40:30,090 --> 00:40:31,632
Give it a try.

708
00:40:31,757 --> 00:40:33,966
Isn't that costume a little bit
small for you, dear?

709
00:40:34,090 --> 00:40:35,298

Oblige again!

Lizzie, oblige again!

734
00:42:06,132 --> 00:42:07,799
They want more!

735
00:42:07,924 --> 00:42:09,362
I don't have any more.

736
00:42:09,423 --> 00:42:11,298
You have them!

737
00:42:27,298 --> 00:42:30,632
Would you look at these
rotten cotton gloves?

738
00:42:30,757 --> 00:42:32,799
That saltwater
will shrink anything.

739
00:42:35,924 --> 00:42:39,799
Least that's what the ladies
down at the docks tell me.

740
00:42:48,590 --> 00:42:50,233
I don't know, I just looked at
the gloves and they looked

741
00:42:50,257 --> 00:42:52,108
so absurd that the line just
came to me like that.

742
00:42:52,132 --> 00:42:53,298
"Them rotten cotton gloves!"

743
00:42:53,423 --> 00:42:55,006
It could be your catchphrase.

744
00:42:55,132 --> 00:42:57,132
No need to dip
into the blue bag so much.

745
00:42:57,257 --> 00:42:58,799
They loved it.
They loved it all.

746
00:42:58,923 --> 00:42:59,799
They love you.

747
00:42:59,923 --> 00:43:01,465
And who wouldn't.

748
00:43:01,590 --> 00:43:02,941
- Uncle!
- Careful, Uncle.

749
00:43:02,965 --> 00:43:04,799
With Lizzie in that getup,

750
00:43:04,923 --> 00:43:06,900
anyone looking over might think
you have an eye for the boys.

751
00:43:06,923 --> 00:43:08,233
Well, let them think
what they like.

752
00:43:08,257 --> 00:43:10,298
More drinks, please!

753
00:43:10,423 --> 00:43:11,941
Little Victor wouldn't
have wanted any of us

754
00:43:11,965 --> 00:43:13,923
standing up at the end
of the night.

755
00:43:15,799 --> 00:43:17,507
I'm tired, I'm afraid.

756
00:43:17,632 --> 00:43:21,799
Walk me home, will you, John?

757
00:43:21,923 --> 00:43:23,465
I'll come back.

758
00:43:28,090 --> 00:43:30,298
Why are you still
wearing your costume?

759
00:43:30,423 --> 00:43:33,799
I hoped it might
keep the men away.

760
00:43:33,923 --> 00:43:37,465
You prefer the girls, Lizzie?

761
00:43:37,590 --> 00:43:39,298
Nothing wrong in that if you do.

762
00:43:39,423 --> 00:43:41,301
Come on, no need to make
something from nothing.

763
00:43:41,423 --> 00:43:43,841
- You dress like a girl.
- Yeah, on stage.

764
00:43:47,465 --> 00:43:49,132
Well, if you really care,

765
00:43:49,257 --> 00:43:51,799
maybe I like
how I felt on stage.

766
00:43:51,923 --> 00:43:54,173
I care.

767
00:43:54,298 --> 00:43:57,799
I care to see you happy.

768
00:43:57,923 --> 00:44:00,340
Tonight...

769
00:44:00,465 --> 00:44:03,006
tonight, you look happy.

770
00:44:03,132 --> 00:44:04,691
We still need
handwriting samples

771
00:44:04,799 --> 00:44:06,132
from Marx, Gissing, and Leno.

772
00:44:06,257 --> 00:44:07,733
Did you speak
with the maid again?

773
00:44:07,757 --> 00:44:09,965
Aveline Ortega?
I did, sir.

774
00:44:10,090 --> 00:44:11,566
She won't hear a word
said against him.

775
00:44:11,590 --> 00:44:12,941
You showed her
the journal entries?

776
00:44:12,965 --> 00:44:15,132
She swore
the writing wasn't his.

777
00:44:15,257 --> 00:44:17,233
If Cree were our Golem,
it would certainly make sense

778
00:44:17,257 --> 00:44:19,298
of him destroying his papers.

779
00:44:19,423 --> 00:44:20,965
And God knows
as a failed playwright,

780
00:44:21,090 --> 00:44:23,298
Cree must've grown sick
of watching his famous wife

781
00:44:23,423 --> 00:44:25,965
earn London's attention.

782
00:44:26,090 --> 00:44:27,298
Do you fancy another?

783
00:44:27,423 --> 00:44:30,132
Trying to get me drunk?

784
00:44:30,257 --> 00:44:31,923
A pint, please.

785
00:44:34,257 --> 00:44:38,507
It was a joke.
Didn't mean nothing.

786
00:44:38,632 --> 00:44:41,132
I didn't mean to offend.

787
00:44:43,298 --> 00:44:45,632
I'm...

788
00:44:45,757 --> 00:44:47,257
on your side.

789
00:44:54,757 --> 00:44:57,298
It's not the Golem
haunting you, is it?

790
00:44:57,423 --> 00:44:58,465
It's her.

791
00:44:58,590 --> 00:45:00,798
She's going to hang, Flood.

792
00:45:00,923 --> 00:45:04,798
We have to rule out
the other suspects.

793
00:45:04,923 --> 00:45:07,965
Well, I may have found
an eyewitness in Limehouse, sir.

794
00:45:08,090 --> 00:45:10,006
Scaoil liom! Scaoil liom!

795
00:45:11,590 --> 00:45:13,340
You're not in any trouble.

796
00:45:13,465 --> 00:45:15,798
I'm taking you to someone
who can translate.

797
00:45:15,923 --> 00:45:16,923
Understand?

798
00:45:20,132 --> 00:45:22,632
This is... This is Sister Mary.

799
00:45:22,757 --> 00:45:25,132
Tá mo mháthair tar
éis mé a dhíol cheana.

800
00:45:25,257 --> 00:45:28,132
Tá fear do m'fhuadach
Ar mo lá breithe.

801
00:45:28,257 --> 00:45:30,465
The child says
she's not for sale.

802
00:45:30,590 --> 00:45:32,965
Her mum's got a fella
taking her on her next birthday.

803
00:45:33,090 --> 00:45:34,965
No, no, please.

804
00:45:35,090 --> 00:45:38,465
Tell her my colleague
showed her some photographs,

805
00:45:38,590 --> 00:45:40,132
suspects in a crime.

806
00:45:40,257 --> 00:45:42,298
She seemed to recognize
one of them.

807
00:45:42,423 --> 00:45:45,257
We need to know where
and when she saw him.

808
00:45:46,923 --> 00:45:50,465
Sir, this is where
Solomon Weil lived!

809
00:45:50,590 --> 00:45:52,340
The scholar, the third victim.

810
00:45:52,465 --> 00:45:55,298
- Which house number did he...
- Number 4.

811
00:46:01,923 --> 00:46:03,257
This man?

812
00:46:06,257 --> 00:46:07,965
Families starve in the streets.

813
00:46:08,090 --> 00:46:10,965
Women are used up
and thrown away, then you...

814
00:46:11,090 --> 00:46:14,132
you persecute one
who fights for the people.

815
00:46:14,257 --> 00:46:17,632
You're not fit to clean the
boots of a man like Karl Marx.

816
00:46:25,632 --> 00:46:27,798
So...

817
00:46:27,923 --> 00:46:29,522
London declares that
the Jew was murdered

818
00:46:29,590 --> 00:46:31,465
by a Jewish monster?

819
00:46:31,590 --> 00:46:34,965
And so absolves itself
of all responsibility.

820
00:46:35,090 --> 00:46:38,465
Make no mistake, gentlemen,
it is not Solomon Weil

821
00:46:38,590 --> 00:46:40,465
who's mutilated
and murdered here.

822
00:46:40,590 --> 00:46:42,006
It is the Jew.

823
00:46:42,132 --> 00:46:44,798
None of the Golem's
other victims were Hebrews, sir.

824
00:46:44,923 --> 00:46:46,798
But do you not see?

825
00:46:46,923 --> 00:46:50,507
This murderer strikes at
the very symbols of the city...

826
00:46:50,632 --> 00:46:52,965
the Jew, the whore.

827
00:46:53,090 --> 00:46:55,132
They are
the sacrificial tributes

828
00:46:55,257 --> 00:46:58,632
in this labyrinth of London.

829
00:46:58,756 --> 00:47:02,923
And so of course must
be ritually butchered.

830
00:47:11,756 --> 00:47:13,423
What is it that
you wish me to write?

831
00:47:16,090 --> 00:47:19,006
"The Morning Herald...

832
00:47:19,132 --> 00:47:23,965
had declined
to review my debut."

833
00:47:24,090 --> 00:47:27,632
All that work for nothing.

834
00:47:27,756 --> 00:47:30,632
I resolved that this time
I'd put on a show

835
00:47:30,756 --> 00:47:33,756
that everyone would notice.

836
00:47:34,923 --> 00:47:39,965
A fine opening act
of the crowd-pleasing sort.

837
00:48:09,257 --> 00:48:12,132
And I went
on to create a spectacle

838
00:48:12,257 --> 00:48:15,631
that no beholder
would ever forget.

839
00:48:21,923 --> 00:48:25,132
"It was all too easy
to kill a whore.

840
00:48:25,257 --> 00:48:28,340
Tonight I would return
to kill the Jew."

841
00:48:28,465 --> 00:48:30,173
This is absurd.

842
00:48:30,298 --> 00:48:32,340
You didn't do this.

843
00:48:32,465 --> 00:48:34,132
Of course I didn't.

844
00:48:37,423 --> 00:48:39,840
Would you agree
with the defendant

845
00:48:39,965 --> 00:48:42,298
that in the weeks
before his death,

846
00:48:42,423 --> 00:48:46,298
Mr. Cree had seemed "morbid"?

847
00:48:46,423 --> 00:48:48,006
No, sir.

848
00:48:48,132 --> 00:48:50,798
He was in good spirits.

849
00:48:50,923 --> 00:48:53,298
And how would you
describe relations

850
00:48:53,423 --> 00:48:56,298
between Mr. Cree and his wife?

851
00:48:56,423 --> 00:48:57,965
Not especially good, sir.

852
00:48:58,090 --> 00:49:00,631
They saw very little
of each other.

853
00:49:00,756 --> 00:49:05,673
And yet Mrs. Cree insisted on
preparing him a nightly draft?

854
00:49:05,798 --> 00:49:07,465
That is correct, sir.

855
00:49:07,589 --> 00:49:10,965
And did you hear
Mr. Cree express suspicions

856
00:49:11,090 --> 00:49:14,798
that she might have tainted
this draft with something?

857
00:49:14,923 --> 00:49:16,965
Not quite.

858
00:49:17,090 --> 00:49:19,798
Though just before his death,

859
00:49:19,923 --> 00:49:22,298
I overheard them in dispute.

860
00:49:22,423 --> 00:49:23,798
I heard Mr. Cree say,

861
00:49:23,923 --> 00:49:26,631
"You devil.
You have done this."

862
00:49:32,589 --> 00:49:37,132
She may as well have placed the
noose around my neck herself.

863
00:49:37,257 --> 00:49:40,298
You must make it plain to the
jury that there was bad blood

864
00:49:40,423 --> 00:49:41,965
between the two of you.

865
00:49:42,090 --> 00:49:43,798
Romantic jealousy.

866
00:49:43,923 --> 00:49:45,798
I never stood between them.

867
00:49:45,923 --> 00:49:48,798
I'm sure my feelings on intimacy
are plain to you by now.

868
00:49:48,923 --> 00:49:50,798
John was free to court
Aveline if he wanted to.

869
00:49:50,923 --> 00:49:53,465
But he had his heart set on you.

870
00:49:53,589 --> 00:49:55,798
I did nothing to encourage it.

871
00:49:55,923 --> 00:49:59,965
My stage career had taken off.
I rarely saw him.

872
00:50:00,090 --> 00:50:02,298
And then...

873
00:50:02,423 --> 00:50:05,132
out of the blue,
he invited me for supper.

874
00:50:05,257 --> 00:50:07,506
Your new show's tremendous.

875
00:50:07,631 --> 00:50:09,233
We feel awful intruding.

876
00:50:09,257 --> 00:50:10,465
We simply adore you.

877
00:50:10,589 --> 00:50:12,631
Thank you.

878
00:50:12,756 --> 00:50:14,298
Thank you.
I'll treasure this.

879
00:50:14,423 --> 00:50:16,465
Thank you very much.

880
00:50:16,589 --> 00:50:19,798
- I can't believe it.
- What a surprise!

881
00:50:19,923 --> 00:50:23,631
As I was saying, I have reached
the end of the first act

882
00:50:23,756 --> 00:50:25,298
of "Misery Junction."

883
00:50:25,423 --> 00:50:28,132
But I can't quite decide
what to do with my heroine next,

884
00:50:28,257 --> 00:50:31,631
and, um, I thought
you might advise me.

885
00:50:31,756 --> 00:50:32,965
I'm flattered.

886
00:50:33,090 --> 00:50:34,528
The heroine's name
is Katherine Dove.

887
00:50:34,589 --> 00:50:36,298
- Hmm.
- When I began,

888
00:50:36,423 --> 00:50:37,798
I had her in the workhouses,

889
00:50:37,923 --> 00:50:42,298
but now I have her
sewing sailcloth on the docks.

890
00:50:42,423 --> 00:50:44,298
My mother died when I was young.

891
00:50:44,423 --> 00:50:45,965
Her kidneys.

892
00:50:46,090 --> 00:50:47,464
It was so fast.

893
00:50:47,589 --> 00:50:49,756
Orphaned and alone at 14.

894
00:50:50,965 --> 00:50:53,173
Is Katherine Dove an orphan?

895
00:50:53,298 --> 00:50:55,464
She could be.

896
00:50:55,589 --> 00:50:57,066
But you've still not told me
what to do with her

897
00:50:57,090 --> 00:50:58,340
by the end of the first act.

898
00:50:58,464 --> 00:50:59,631
What's your dilemma?

899
00:50:59,756 --> 00:51:00,965
At the moment,

900
00:51:01,090 --> 00:51:03,840
she's very close
to starvation and ruin,

901
00:51:03,965 --> 00:51:06,965
and I'm wondering
if I should rescue her.

902
00:51:07,090 --> 00:51:08,798
Yes.

903
00:51:08,923 --> 00:51:11,132
Have her become successful.

904
00:51:11,257 --> 00:51:13,340
Loved by her audiences.

905
00:51:13,464 --> 00:51:15,298
But she's very much alone.

906
00:51:15,422 --> 00:51:17,021
Living in theatrical digs,
hand to mouth.

907
00:51:17,090 --> 00:51:18,464
It's a life of degradation.

908
00:51:18,589 --> 00:51:19,965
Come on.

909
00:51:20,090 --> 00:51:22,298
People love to see degradation
upon the stage.

910
00:51:22,422 --> 00:51:23,798
It's what they pay for.

911
00:51:23,923 --> 00:51:25,798
Yeah, but they expect
to see a happy ending.

912
00:51:25,923 --> 00:51:28,464
And Katherine deserves
a protector.

913
00:51:28,589 --> 00:51:29,840
She does.

914
00:51:29,965 --> 00:51:32,340
Her manager, perhaps.

915
00:51:32,464 --> 00:51:34,298
Someone kindly, like Uncle.

916
00:51:34,422 --> 00:51:36,341
No, an elderly character,
the audience would know

917
00:51:36,422 --> 00:51:38,965
he wouldn't live
to see her into old age.

918
00:51:39,090 --> 00:51:40,464
A friend, then.

919
00:51:40,589 --> 00:51:41,840
A comic, maybe.

920
00:51:41,965 --> 00:51:45,132
I would like to
give her a suitor.

921
00:51:45,257 --> 00:51:48,006
Someone who cares fiercely
for her well-being.

922
00:51:48,132 --> 00:51:50,464
A white knight.

923
00:51:50,589 --> 00:51:54,132
What do you think?

924
00:51:54,257 --> 00:51:56,298
I think Katherine Dove can
look out for herself.

925
00:52:00,090 --> 00:52:01,631
In the bowl.

926
00:52:01,756 --> 00:52:02,798
Yes, there we go.

927
00:52:02,923 --> 00:52:03,922
Get it out.

928
00:52:03,965 --> 00:52:05,840
That's it.

929
00:52:05,965 --> 00:52:07,631
Gin.

930
00:52:07,756 --> 00:52:09,965
Down here.

931
00:52:10,090 --> 00:52:13,464
There we go.

932
00:52:13,589 --> 00:52:15,006
God.

933
00:52:15,132 --> 00:52:17,589
I think I put my back out
carrying her up the stairs.

934
00:52:20,756 --> 00:52:24,006
I see you decided to dress
as a woman this evening.

935
00:52:24,132 --> 00:52:26,173
Can't wear a costume
out to supper, can I?

936
00:52:26,298 --> 00:52:27,506
Wouldn't be the first time.

937
00:52:36,631 --> 00:52:38,840
Be careful of that one, Lizzie.

938
00:52:38,965 --> 00:52:40,506
Don't lead him up
the garden path

939
00:52:40,631 --> 00:52:43,631
unless you're prepared
to be dragged indoors.

940
00:52:43,756 --> 00:52:45,673
He offered me the lead
in "Misery Junction."

941
00:52:45,798 --> 00:52:48,298
He'll expect something
in return.

942
00:52:56,965 --> 00:53:00,298
You don't need him, Lizzie.

943
00:53:00,422 --> 00:53:02,090
You did all this on your own.

944
00:53:05,132 --> 00:53:08,464
I could do more.

945
00:53:08,589 --> 00:53:11,798
Could be a real actress.

946
00:53:11,923 --> 00:53:15,673
Show the world what people
like us are really capable of.

947
00:53:18,090 --> 00:53:22,339
I just need a chance.

948
00:53:22,464 --> 00:53:26,132
Here we sit, the two most
famous faces on the stage,

949
00:53:26,257 --> 00:53:30,006
and you suggest the world
conspires to oppress us.

950
00:53:30,132 --> 00:53:31,840
Remember that book you lent me?

951
00:53:31,965 --> 00:53:34,464
Pope?
In the temple of fame,

952
00:53:34,589 --> 00:53:38,132
some people's names are carved
in stone and others in ice.

953
00:53:38,257 --> 00:53:41,132
We're clowns, Dan.

954
00:53:41,257 --> 00:53:43,756
We'll be forgotten.

955
00:53:46,257 --> 00:53:48,840
If you think a man like John
Cree is going to change that,

956
00:53:48,965 --> 00:53:51,006
I don't have
the breath to argue.

957
00:53:53,756 --> 00:53:55,965
And you know she's got
a soft spot for him.

958
00:53:56,090 --> 00:53:59,464
And whatever her faults,
she's family.

959
00:53:59,589 --> 00:54:01,631
And we look out
for each other, don't we?

960
00:54:08,965 --> 00:54:10,339
The big finale is the hanging.

961
00:54:10,464 --> 00:54:11,631
We've a life-size gallows.

962
00:54:11,756 --> 00:54:13,297
I'll wear this harness,
concealed,

963
00:54:13,422 --> 00:54:14,732
and then drop right
through the trap just there.

964
00:54:14,756 --> 00:54:16,006
Looks just like a real hanging.

965
00:54:16,132 --> 00:54:17,732
Lizzie, you sure it's safe,
this contraption?

966
00:54:17,756 --> 00:54:18,899
You're not wearing
a real noose, are you?

967
00:54:18,923 --> 00:54:20,173
Oh, the noose is real,

968
00:54:20,297 --> 00:54:23,297
but the fall is broken
by the harness.

969
00:54:23,422 --> 00:54:24,840
Where's Lizzie?

970
00:54:24,965 --> 00:54:27,673
Up above giving John Cree
an interview for The Era.

971
00:54:27,798 --> 00:54:29,297
Is that what they call it?

972
00:54:29,422 --> 00:54:30,701
I'll go and tell her
to hurry up.

973
00:54:30,798 --> 00:54:32,631
The play's a shocker,
but a spoof shocker,

974
00:54:32,756 --> 00:54:34,514
the way only our marvelous
company can do it.

975
00:54:34,589 --> 00:54:36,631
Dan wrote it.
It's based on the, uh,

976
00:54:36,756 --> 00:54:38,631
the Ratcliffe Highway murders
of 1811.

977
00:54:38,756 --> 00:54:39,965
- John Williams.
- Pardon?

978
00:54:40,090 --> 00:54:41,506
The killer's name
was John Williams.

979
00:54:41,631 --> 00:54:43,132
Oh, quite.
But much of it is fiction.

980
00:54:43,256 --> 00:54:44,798
It's all great fun,
and terribly gory.

981
00:54:44,923 --> 00:54:46,440
Oh, you must put that
in for your readers.

982
00:54:46,464 --> 00:54:48,631
Dan says everybody thrills
to gore these days.

983
00:54:48,756 --> 00:54:50,506
Let's have you finished, John.

984
00:54:50,631 --> 00:54:53,132
She's not even ready and
she's on stage in 10 minutes.

985
00:54:53,256 --> 00:54:55,631
We can't have the star late
for the first performance.

986
00:54:55,756 --> 00:54:57,514
Dan's still the star.
Always will be.

987
00:54:57,631 --> 00:55:00,297
Thought I felt my ears burning.

988
00:55:00,422 --> 00:55:02,965
- Did anyone check the safety?
- Of course.

989
00:55:03,090 --> 00:55:04,941
Wouldn't let anything happen
to our Lizzie, would we?

990
00:55:04,965 --> 00:55:06,297
- How's the crowd?
- Excellent.

991
00:55:06,422 --> 00:55:07,631
Great number of Jews.

992
00:55:07,756 --> 00:55:09,965
I believe it's one
of their holidays.

993
00:55:10,090 --> 00:55:11,798
You should speak
to them in Yiddish.

994
00:55:11,923 --> 00:55:13,297
They will love it.

995
00:55:13,422 --> 00:55:14,965
Wish them...

996
00:55:15,090 --> 00:55:17,631
"meesa meschina."

997
00:55:22,422 --> 00:55:25,132
Welcome, brave hearts,
to an evening of horror.

998
00:55:31,589 --> 00:55:33,297
Our play's about to begin,

999
00:55:33,422 --> 00:55:36,464
but first, ladies and gentlemen,

1000
00:55:36,589 --> 00:55:40,631
and those not unconnected with a
certain historical chosen race,

1001
00:55:40,756 --> 00:55:44,132
may I wish you all
from the bottom of my heart

1002
00:55:44,256 --> 00:55:47,172
meesa meschina.

1003
00:55:47,297 --> 00:55:48,631
That is mashugana!

1004
00:55:55,923 --> 00:55:57,297
What did you say that for?!

1005
00:55:57,422 --> 00:55:58,631
What happened?

1006
00:55:58,756 --> 00:56:00,232
Lizzie wished the Jews
a sudden death!

1007
00:56:00,256 --> 00:56:01,798
Oh!

1008
00:56:01,923 --> 00:56:04,798
Here we are again!

1009
00:56:09,256 --> 00:56:10,965
It was only a lark, Lizzie.

1010
00:56:18,090 --> 00:56:20,506
I came back at once to see
if you were all right.

1011
00:56:46,589 --> 00:56:49,297
And after that,
you began courting?

1012
00:56:49,422 --> 00:56:52,131
After a fashion.

1013
00:56:52,256 --> 00:56:53,895
I could never love
John enough to give him

1014
00:56:53,965 --> 00:56:56,464
what he really wanted.

1015
00:56:56,589 --> 00:57:00,297
But you grew to love him?

1016
00:57:00,422 --> 00:57:03,464
I wanted to be in his play.

1017
00:57:03,589 --> 00:57:07,006
He wanted the gratification
of plucking a poor needy girl

1018
00:57:07,131 --> 00:57:09,089
from misery and saving her.

1019
00:57:11,422 --> 00:57:14,339
We used one another equally.

1020
00:57:14,464 --> 00:57:18,297
Perhaps that's the best that
can be said of any coupling.

1021
00:57:18,422 --> 00:57:21,297
That's a very dim view.

1022
00:57:21,422 --> 00:57:24,589
If you seek a dim view,
be sure to ask a comedian.

1023
00:57:35,089 --> 00:57:38,131
Alice Stanton's dress
finally showed up.

1024
00:57:38,256 --> 00:57:41,422
Improperly archived,
like everything else here.

1025
00:57:44,923 --> 00:57:46,256
Been at the jail again?

1026
00:57:49,923 --> 00:57:52,131
Anything more on Cree?

1027
00:57:52,256 --> 00:57:54,131
Only that he was
a manipulative ass

1028
00:57:54,256 --> 00:57:55,732
who fancied himself
as a white knight.

1029
00:57:55,756 --> 00:57:57,631
I meant as relating to our case.

1030
00:57:57,756 --> 00:58:00,673
The Golem. Remember him?

1031
00:58:00,798 --> 00:58:02,356
Cree knew of the murderer
John Williams.

1032
00:58:02,422 --> 00:58:03,965
Yet, apparently,
so did Dan Leno.

1033
00:58:04,089 --> 00:58:05,774
In fact, Leno wrote
a whole play about the fellow.

1034
00:58:05,798 --> 00:58:08,297
Golem suspect who is alive.
That would be bad news.

1035
00:58:08,422 --> 00:58:10,631
- For his next victim, certainly.
- And for you.

1036
00:58:10,756 --> 00:58:12,232
Or do you no longer care
what becomes of your career?

1037
00:58:12,256 --> 00:58:13,840
I've a job to do
and I'm doing it.

1038
00:58:13,965 --> 00:58:16,297
- And which job would that be?
- Watch your tongue, Flood.

1039
00:58:16,422 --> 00:58:18,020
Do I need to remind you
of your position?

1040
00:58:18,089 --> 00:58:20,131
That may be helpful.

1041
00:58:20,256 --> 00:58:22,131
Because there are times
when I'm confused

1042
00:58:22,256 --> 00:58:24,131
as to whether we're here
to find the Golem

1043
00:58:24,256 --> 00:58:25,464
or to save Elizabeth.

1044
00:58:25,589 --> 00:58:28,172
Perhaps we'll do both!

1045
00:58:28,297 --> 00:58:30,798
Who knows...

1046
00:58:34,297 --> 00:58:36,464
Dear God, how many pockets
did Leno need?

1047
00:58:36,589 --> 00:58:38,172
He tosses things into the crowd.

1048
00:58:38,297 --> 00:58:40,172
Sweeties. Flowers.
Undergarments.

1049
00:58:40,297 --> 00:58:41,506
Sounds hilarious.

1050
00:58:41,631 --> 00:58:43,131
Didn't Roberts
empty the contents?

1051
00:58:43,256 --> 00:58:44,464
The coroner's office did it.

1052
00:58:44,589 --> 00:58:45,923
Why?
Did they miss something?

1053
00:58:59,256 --> 00:59:01,005
8 Gower Place?

1054
00:59:01,131 --> 00:59:02,297
Why do I know that?

1055
00:59:02,422 --> 00:59:04,506
Perhaps because
we're due a visit.

1056
00:59:04,631 --> 00:59:06,589
It's George Gissing's address.

1057
00:59:08,131 --> 00:59:09,969
His wife gave him
an alibi for the night

1058
00:59:10,089 --> 00:59:11,631
of the Ratcliffe Highway
murders,

1059
00:59:11,756 --> 00:59:14,172
but she seemed
fond of her drink.

1060
00:59:21,756 --> 00:59:24,339
We need to talk to Mr. Gissing,
madam.

1061
00:59:24,464 --> 00:59:26,631
George isn't here.
He just left.

1062
00:59:26,756 --> 00:59:28,131
Do you know where he was going?

1063
00:59:28,256 --> 00:59:30,422
Limehouse, perhaps?

1064
00:59:53,256 --> 00:59:54,506
Not yet.

1065
00:59:54,631 --> 00:59:56,464
I'm interested to see
where he goes.

1066
00:59:56,589 --> 01:00:00,131
What business a scholar has
in the streets of Limehouse.

1067
01:00:39,422 --> 01:00:41,464
Madam, we're from Scotland Yard.

1068
01:00:41,589 --> 01:00:42,607
We're just a pharmacy.

1069
01:00:42,631 --> 01:00:44,964
You go away!
Check my record!

1070
01:00:48,256 --> 01:00:50,131
Our business
is with Mr. Gissing,

1071
01:00:50,256 --> 01:00:52,339
the man who just entered,
not you.

1072
01:00:55,589 --> 01:00:57,172
Good customer.

1073
01:00:57,297 --> 01:00:59,089
He keep his work here.

1074
01:01:02,297 --> 01:01:03,339
Always working.

1075
01:01:03,464 --> 01:01:05,297
Writing.

1076
01:01:08,089 --> 01:01:09,964
Mr. Gissing,
I'm Detective Inspector Kildare

1077
01:01:10,089 --> 01:01:11,964
of Scotland Yard.

1078
01:01:12,089 --> 01:01:13,964
Perhaps you could explain
how this came to be

1079
01:01:14,089 --> 01:01:16,422
in the possession
of a murdered woman.

1080
01:01:18,589 --> 01:01:20,964
I'm afraid you'll find
my address in the pockets

1081
01:01:21,089 --> 01:01:23,464
of a great many women
in this area, sir.

1082
01:01:23,589 --> 01:01:26,506
My wife, Nell, is in the habit
of... going missing.

1083
01:01:26,631 --> 01:01:27,798
I give my address so that

1084
01:01:27,922 --> 01:01:30,131
they may contact me
if they see her.

1085
01:01:30,256 --> 01:01:33,839
Let us just say my wife
used to ply the same trade.

1086
01:01:33,964 --> 01:01:36,798
You don't seem in the least
bit surprised.

1087
01:01:36,922 --> 01:01:38,131
By what?

1088
01:01:38,256 --> 01:01:40,464
That a gentleman like me,
a-a scholar,

1089
01:01:40,589 --> 01:01:41,839
should have wed a fallen woman.

1090
01:01:41,964 --> 01:01:43,964
Why would anyone be surprised?

1091
01:01:44,089 --> 01:01:46,339
The world is full of men
like you, Mr. Gissing.

1092
01:01:46,464 --> 01:01:47,964
I beg your pardon?

1093
01:01:48,089 --> 01:01:50,339
Men who feign generosity
when what they really seek

1094
01:01:50,464 --> 01:01:51,673
is congratulation.

1095
01:01:51,797 --> 01:01:53,964
Men who play God
by saving lives.

1096
01:01:54,089 --> 01:01:56,464
Is it really so different,
I wonder,

1097
01:01:56,589 --> 01:01:58,131
from playing God by taking them?

1098
01:01:58,256 --> 01:02:00,172
I am not a murderer, sir.

1099
01:02:00,297 --> 01:02:03,964
Then perhaps you will
write the words that I dictate?

1100
01:02:04,089 --> 01:02:06,297
Let's get this thing done.

1101
01:02:06,422 --> 01:02:11,172
"September 10, 1880."

1102
01:02:11,297 --> 01:02:13,339
My public debut...

1103
01:02:13,464 --> 01:02:16,172
"had garnered rave reviews."

1104
01:02:16,297 --> 01:02:18,107
I could scarcely
wait to begin work

1105
01:02:18,131 --> 01:02:20,131
on my next creation,

1106
01:02:20,256 --> 01:02:22,839
but there was time
to pass before dark,

1107
01:02:22,964 --> 01:02:26,797
so I paid a visit
to the Ratcliffe Highway shop.

1108
01:02:33,422 --> 01:02:36,506
I bought some cufflinks
from the owner's wife.

1109
01:02:36,631 --> 01:02:38,797
I could tell that
when the time came,

1110
01:02:38,922 --> 01:02:41,631
she would make a fine player
in my magnum opus.

1111
01:03:16,589 --> 01:03:19,297
You're not
the Jew from the library.

1112
01:03:19,422 --> 01:03:20,964
Ah, well.

1113
01:03:21,089 --> 01:03:23,464
No matter.

1114
01:03:23,589 --> 01:03:26,172
Who are you?
What do you want?

1115
01:03:26,297 --> 01:03:28,464
I have come to discourse
with you.

1116
01:03:28,589 --> 01:03:31,589
About death
and everlasting life.

1117
01:03:33,256 --> 01:03:34,797
Herein...

1118
01:03:34,922 --> 01:03:36,964
lies the secret.

1119
01:03:46,297 --> 01:03:49,339
It was here that
I read of the mythical Golem,

1120
01:03:49,464 --> 01:03:53,131
a homunculus of clay
given life by man.

1121
01:03:53,256 --> 01:03:55,172
How could any Londoner
fail to delight

1122
01:03:55,297 --> 01:03:57,172
in this piece of theater?

1123
01:03:57,297 --> 01:03:59,506
I could even see myself
appearing before

1124
01:03:59,631 --> 01:04:01,964
the next unfortunate
with mallet in hand

1125
01:04:02,089 --> 01:04:05,839
exclaiming,
"Here we are again."

1126
01:04:09,422 --> 01:04:10,839
May I go now?

1127
01:04:10,964 --> 01:04:12,464
What?

1128
01:04:12,589 --> 01:04:14,964
Oh, yes, I'm sorry.

1129
01:04:15,089 --> 01:04:16,631
Why would you be
thinking of me still?

1130
01:04:16,755 --> 01:04:18,797
My hand doesn't match at all.
You know I'm innocent.

1131
01:04:18,922 --> 01:04:20,797
I know.
I was reading what you wrote.

1132
01:04:20,922 --> 01:04:22,464
You were in my mind.
I'm sorry.

1133
01:04:22,589 --> 01:04:24,131
Something I missed.

1134
01:04:24,256 --> 01:04:25,797
Oh, I see. What is it?

1135
01:04:25,922 --> 01:04:28,964
A line from the journal.

1136
01:04:29,089 --> 01:04:34,506
"I bought some cufflinks
from the owner's wife."

1137
01:04:34,630 --> 01:04:36,839
On September the 10th,

1138
01:04:36,964 --> 01:04:40,131
the Golem made a purchase
from the Ratcliffe Highway shop.

1139
01:05:02,422 --> 01:05:04,964
A new production of "Bluebeard"

1140
01:05:05,089 --> 01:05:06,131
opens this weekend,

1141
01:05:06,256 --> 01:05:07,964
and all of London longs

1142
01:05:08,089 --> 01:05:12,630
to see the great Dan Leno
performing it.

1143
01:05:12,755 --> 01:05:18,672
But I know they yearn
for more potent excitements.

1144
01:05:18,797 --> 01:05:24,839
This is pantomime
in its purest form.

1145
01:05:24,964 --> 01:05:26,964
I could even see myself
appearing

1146
01:05:27,089 --> 01:05:28,630
before the next unfortunate,

1147
01:05:28,755 --> 01:05:31,297
with a mallet in my hand,
exclaiming,

1148
01:05:31,422 --> 01:05:34,297
"Here we are again!"

1149
01:05:41,422 --> 01:05:45,464
What strange coincidence
and delight to discover,

1150
01:05:45,588 --> 01:05:47,630
on the streets of Limehouse,

1151
01:05:47,755 --> 01:05:52,797
a whore wearing a costume
I remembered well.

1152
01:05:52,922 --> 01:05:56,464
She was a player
waiting for a role.

1153
01:05:56,588 --> 01:05:59,630
Of course, I obliged her.

1154
01:05:59,755 --> 01:06:03,839
The public yearned
for the next installment.

1155
01:06:03,964 --> 01:06:07,297
And one should never
keep an audience waiting.

1156
01:06:10,922 --> 01:06:13,964
We need to forget about
Cree and concentrate on Leno.

1157
01:06:14,089 --> 01:06:18,005
The Golem even imagined himself
saying, "Here we are again."

1158
01:06:18,131 --> 01:06:21,630
I know, but apparently everyone
knows Leno's catch-phrase.

1159
01:06:21,755 --> 01:06:23,464
There's Alice Stanton's dress

1160
01:06:23,588 --> 01:06:25,630
and the fact
he knew Mr. Gerrard.

1161
01:06:25,755 --> 01:06:27,297
We're all part
of London's tapestry.

1162
01:06:27,422 --> 01:06:30,588
Sometimes threads get crossed.

1163
01:06:32,422 --> 01:06:34,588
Good Lord!

1164
01:06:38,256 --> 01:06:40,297
We should buy tickets.

1165
01:06:40,422 --> 01:06:41,839
I'd be intrigued
to see how it ends.

1166
01:06:41,964 --> 01:06:43,464
I could recommend many
better shows.

1167
01:06:43,588 --> 01:06:45,172
I was making a joke, Flood.

1168
01:06:45,297 --> 01:06:47,172
As was I.

1169
01:06:47,297 --> 01:06:48,964
Obviously.

1170
01:06:49,089 --> 01:06:50,964
Who'd wish to see something
in such poor taste?

1171
01:06:51,089 --> 01:06:53,797
Apparently London's appetite
for horror knows no bounds.

1172
01:06:53,922 --> 01:06:56,339
Our Golem was quite
correct about that.

1173
01:06:56,464 --> 01:06:58,964
Oh, Bluey, please!

1174
01:06:59,089 --> 01:07:00,464
Have mercy!

1175
01:07:00,588 --> 01:07:03,464
It's been days since I've eaten!

1176
01:07:14,422 --> 01:07:18,131
Oh, you are a kind man, Bluey!

1177
01:07:18,256 --> 01:07:21,339
I shall never have it said
you're not good to me.

1178
01:07:22,755 --> 01:07:25,463
I thought I might expire
from starvation.

1179
01:07:39,422 --> 01:07:41,797
What on earth
are you doing, dear?!

1180
01:07:41,922 --> 01:07:42,940
I'm taking my medical treatment.

1181
01:07:42,964 --> 01:07:44,672
You're treatment?!

1182
01:07:44,797 --> 01:07:49,131
The doctor told me to take a
daily walk on an empty stomach.

1183
01:07:54,755 --> 01:07:58,463
Ah. Brought the receipt, as
you requested in your telegram.

1184
01:08:00,630 --> 01:08:04,672
As you will see,
I did not buy cufflinks.

1185
01:08:04,797 --> 01:08:06,339
A ladies' hat.

1186
01:08:06,463 --> 01:08:09,964
I often shopped for stagewear
at Gerrard's little shop.

1187
01:08:10,089 --> 01:08:11,339
God rest him.

1188
01:08:11,463 --> 01:08:12,964
I knew him well.

1189
01:08:13,089 --> 01:08:15,797
Oh, now, you mentioned needing
a sample of my hand.

1190
01:08:15,922 --> 01:08:18,630
Well, I-I-I brought a pile
of my old papers.

1191
01:08:18,755 --> 01:08:20,630
Please, take as many
as you see fit.

1192
01:08:20,755 --> 01:08:22,839
I'm afraid I'll need you
to produce a sample

1193
01:08:22,964 --> 01:08:26,839
in my presence, Mr. Leno.

1194
01:08:26,964 --> 01:08:28,630
Then you will permit me
to pay you a visit

1195
01:08:28,755 --> 01:08:30,839
at Scotland Yard
tomorrow afternoon?

1196
01:08:30,964 --> 01:08:34,172
Only,
I have supper arrangements.

1197
01:08:34,297 --> 01:08:37,463
And I've still to be rid
of all of this.

1198
01:08:37,588 --> 01:08:39,463
If you'll... excuse me?

1199
01:08:39,588 --> 01:08:40,964
Perhaps we could continue

1200
01:08:41,089 --> 01:08:43,839
to talk while you're...

1201
01:08:43,964 --> 01:08:49,463
I've some questions I'd like to
ask you about John Cree.

1202
01:08:49,588 --> 01:08:51,172
Then I shall try to answer them.

1203
01:08:51,297 --> 01:08:53,297
Though one should never
speak ill of the dead.

1204
01:08:53,421 --> 01:08:54,630
You didn't care for the man?

1205
01:08:54,755 --> 01:08:56,131
I was friendly with his wife.

1206
01:08:56,256 --> 01:08:57,630
He made her unhappy.

1207
01:08:57,755 --> 01:09:00,005
You may extrapolate the rest.

1208
01:09:00,131 --> 01:09:02,630
When did you last see him?

1209
01:09:02,755 --> 01:09:05,672
First night of his play,
"Misery Junction,"

1210
01:09:05,797 --> 01:09:07,630
which also happened
to be the closing night.

1211
01:09:07,755 --> 01:09:10,297
I know.
Did you see him afterwards?

1212
01:09:10,421 --> 01:09:11,463
Of course.

1213
01:09:11,588 --> 01:09:14,172
This is my theatre.

1214
01:09:14,297 --> 01:09:18,630
I took over managing it
last year when...

1215
01:09:18,755 --> 01:09:21,964
Uncle joined the great pantomime
in the sky.

1216
01:09:22,089 --> 01:09:24,338
The performance was here?

1217
01:09:24,463 --> 01:09:26,131
For Lizzie's sake.

1218
01:09:26,256 --> 01:09:28,797
Whatever became
of our friendship,

1219
01:09:28,922 --> 01:09:32,630
we'll always be family.

1220
01:09:32,755 --> 01:09:34,297
Is John Cree a suspect?

1221
01:09:34,421 --> 01:09:35,797
I'm not at liberty to say.

1222
01:09:35,922 --> 01:09:37,630
A posthumous suspect.

1223
01:09:37,755 --> 01:09:39,463
What will you do,
dig him up for the trial?

1224
01:09:39,588 --> 01:09:41,065
Do you know why Lizzie might be

1225
01:09:41,089 --> 01:09:44,630
reluctant to voice
any suspicions?

1226
01:09:44,755 --> 01:09:47,505
You think she's protecting him?

1227
01:09:47,630 --> 01:09:49,964
Now, that's a novel slant.

1228
01:09:50,089 --> 01:09:53,797
Most people believe
she poisoned him.

1229
01:09:53,922 --> 01:09:56,421
Do you?

1230
01:09:58,797 --> 01:10:03,463
Either way, that man was
the author of his own demise.

1231
01:10:03,588 --> 01:10:05,797
He practically destroyed her.

1232
01:10:05,922 --> 01:10:07,241
Insisting she give up
the stage...

1233
01:10:07,296 --> 01:10:10,463
I mean, he may as well
have ended her life.

1234
01:10:10,588 --> 01:10:13,964
Do you think he
was capable of ending a life?

1235
01:10:14,089 --> 01:10:17,505
Literally, I mean.

1236
01:10:17,630 --> 01:10:21,630
Who knows what any man
is capable of?

1237
01:10:21,755 --> 01:10:24,296
We all wear pantomime masks,

1238
01:10:24,421 --> 01:10:25,797
do we not?

1239
01:10:28,089 --> 01:10:30,463
I'm sorry,
I really must dress now.

1240
01:10:30,588 --> 01:10:33,256
First, tell me
about Little Victor.

1241
01:10:35,463 --> 01:10:38,131
If the injustices of the past
interest you,

1242
01:10:38,256 --> 01:10:41,630
you'd do better to look into
the demise of Tommy Farr.

1243
01:10:41,755 --> 01:10:43,463
Uncle?

1244
01:10:43,588 --> 01:10:45,797
Uncle.

1245
01:10:56,255 --> 01:10:57,672
They said the jury expects

1246
01:10:57,797 --> 01:10:59,463
to reach a verdict
this afternoon.

1247
01:10:59,588 --> 01:11:01,463
I know. Lizzie...

1248
01:11:01,588 --> 01:11:02,630
It would seem the press

1249
01:11:02,755 --> 01:11:05,255
have reached theirs already.

1250
01:11:07,421 --> 01:11:09,131
Lizzie, I spoke with Dan.

1251
01:11:09,255 --> 01:11:13,131
He urged me to look
into Uncle's death.

1252
01:11:13,255 --> 01:11:14,564
If you wanted to know
about Uncle,

1253
01:11:14,588 --> 01:11:16,630
you should simply have asked.

1254
01:11:16,755 --> 01:11:19,338
Come into the parlor.

1255
01:11:19,463 --> 01:11:23,131
As the spider said to the fly.

1256
01:11:23,255 --> 01:11:25,005
Isn't that how it goes?

1257
01:11:25,131 --> 01:11:26,296
The rhyme?

1258
01:11:26,421 --> 01:11:29,131
It may be, Lizzie.

1259
01:11:29,255 --> 01:11:31,296
It may be.

1260
01:11:31,421 --> 01:11:32,463
Cucumber sandwich?

1261
01:11:32,588 --> 01:11:33,463
No, thanks.

1262
01:11:33,588 --> 01:11:35,296
Oh, I forgot.

1263
01:11:35,421 --> 01:11:37,630
You're not entirely partial
to cucumber, are you?

1264
01:11:40,922 --> 01:11:43,131
What's this about, Uncle?

1265
01:11:43,255 --> 01:11:45,630
Why'd you invite me?

1266
01:11:45,755 --> 01:11:47,463
I want to show you something.

1267
01:11:48,964 --> 01:11:50,588
Well, close your eyes.

1268
01:11:52,922 --> 01:11:54,296
Good girl.

1269
01:11:55,922 --> 01:11:57,588
Shh!

1270
01:12:18,964 --> 01:12:22,463
It's just my fun, Lizzie.

1271
01:12:22,588 --> 01:12:26,171
I like a good beating
every now and again.

1272
01:12:26,296 --> 01:12:28,296
Doesn't everyone?

1273
01:12:28,421 --> 01:12:30,463
I know her.

1274
01:12:30,588 --> 01:12:32,107
That's the girl who assisted
the Great Bolini.

1275
01:12:32,131 --> 01:12:33,672
She used to be sawn in half.

1276
01:12:33,797 --> 01:12:35,630
That's her, ducks.

1277
01:12:35,755 --> 01:12:38,964
What a performer.

1278
01:12:39,089 --> 01:12:41,463
But it's a shame she had
to leave the company.

1279
01:12:41,588 --> 01:12:43,296
Why have you shown me this?

1280
01:12:43,421 --> 01:12:44,797
Don't play the innocent with me.

1281
01:12:44,922 --> 01:12:47,296
I am not playing.
I am real.

1282
01:12:47,421 --> 01:12:49,839
Well, I'd be grateful
if you could oblige me, Lizzie,

1283
01:12:49,964 --> 01:12:53,463
with a pose, a tableau.

1284
01:12:53,588 --> 01:12:55,130
Perhaps a little beating?

1285
01:12:55,255 --> 01:12:56,922
I'd rather be destroyed first.

1286
01:12:58,964 --> 01:13:00,731
I'm prepared to forget
this visit ever took place.

1287
01:13:00,755 --> 01:13:04,463
Well, as I said,
it is a pity she had to go.

1288
01:13:04,588 --> 01:13:06,797
She grew tired of performing.

1289
01:13:06,922 --> 01:13:09,630
You would never be rid of me.

1290
01:13:09,755 --> 01:13:12,296
Dan would never allow it.

1291
01:13:12,421 --> 01:13:15,130
Well, I find,
as keeper of bunce,

1292
01:13:15,255 --> 01:13:18,296
that I can do as I please.

1293
01:13:18,421 --> 01:13:22,797
Now, you keep my secret

1294
01:13:22,922 --> 01:13:24,630
and I'll keep yours.

1295
01:13:24,755 --> 01:13:26,089
I have no secrets.

1296
01:13:28,255 --> 01:13:30,296
You shall in a moment.

1297
01:13:42,588 --> 01:13:44,797
He said I'm return
to him next Sunday

1298
01:13:44,922 --> 01:13:47,839
and every Sunday hereafter.

1299
01:13:47,964 --> 01:13:50,630
To do the same again?

1300
01:13:50,755 --> 01:13:53,505
There's photographs.

1301
01:13:53,630 --> 01:13:54,731
John, I had to speak
of it to somebody.

1302
01:13:54,755 --> 01:13:56,296
This is monstrous, Lizzie!

1303
01:13:56,421 --> 01:13:58,421
You can't tell a soul.

1304
01:14:00,755 --> 01:14:03,630
I shall put a stop to this.

1305
01:14:03,755 --> 01:14:06,630
But first...

1306
01:14:06,755 --> 01:14:08,005
I wish to do this.

1307
01:14:09,588 --> 01:14:11,296
He's robbed you of your honor.

1308
01:14:11,421 --> 01:14:13,588
Let me restore it to you.

1309
01:14:15,922 --> 01:14:19,797
Uncle died three days
after John confronted him.

1310
01:14:19,922 --> 01:14:21,171
Uncle was not young.

1311
01:14:21,296 --> 01:14:23,296
He had a weak heart
and a fondness for drink.

1312
01:14:23,421 --> 01:14:25,296
That's not what Dan Leno thinks.

1313
01:14:25,421 --> 01:14:28,130
He thinks that John blackmailed
Uncle into changing his will

1314
01:14:28,255 --> 01:14:29,797
and then killed him.

1315
01:14:29,922 --> 01:14:32,088
£500 and the camera.

1316
01:14:33,922 --> 01:14:36,755
It would seem I gave
an excellent beating.

1317
01:14:38,588 --> 01:14:42,296
You don't want
to be saved, do you?

1318
01:14:42,421 --> 01:14:44,296
Not by me.

1319
01:14:44,421 --> 01:14:47,130
Not by any man.

1320
01:14:47,255 --> 01:14:49,338
I don't deserve to be saved.

1321
01:15:05,755 --> 01:15:06,797
John, I can't.

1322
01:15:06,922 --> 01:15:08,630
Huh?
What do you mean?

1323
01:15:08,755 --> 01:15:09,898
We're husband and wife
now, Lizzie.

1324
01:15:09,922 --> 01:15:11,338
I know.

1325
01:15:11,463 --> 01:15:13,296
Three years I've waited.

1326
01:15:13,421 --> 01:15:16,797
Three years of courtship
and endless bloody engagement.

1327
01:15:16,922 --> 01:15:20,130
It's hardly my fault that panto
season extended 'til Easter.

1328
01:15:20,255 --> 01:15:22,797
Would you have had me spend our
wedding night playing Aladdin?

1329
01:15:22,922 --> 01:15:24,130
It seems now that option

1330
01:15:24,255 --> 01:15:25,534
would've been
scarcely different.

1331
01:15:25,588 --> 01:15:26,731
Please, John,
just try to understand.

1332
01:15:26,755 --> 01:15:28,672
No, you understand!

1333
01:15:28,797 --> 01:15:31,130
John, please, I don't like it.

1334
01:15:31,255 --> 01:15:33,231
I don't ask for gratitude
for all I've done for you.

1335
01:15:33,255 --> 01:15:37,797
All I ask is that you fulfill
your duties as a wife.

1336
01:15:50,421 --> 01:15:53,130
What are you doing here?

1337
01:15:55,255 --> 01:15:56,588
Hello.

1338
01:15:57,797 --> 01:15:59,505
- Hello.
- Hello.

1339
01:15:59,630 --> 01:16:02,797
I'll have a new contract
drawn up tomorrow, John John.

1340
01:16:02,922 --> 01:16:06,463
- But don't you worry.
- Lizzie!

1341
01:16:06,588 --> 01:16:07,922
Lizzie.

1342
01:16:10,922 --> 01:16:13,963
Well, well.

1343
01:16:14,088 --> 01:16:17,463
If it isn't Mrs. John Cree.

1344
01:16:17,588 --> 01:16:19,231
Three months of married life
and you're missing

1345
01:16:19,255 --> 01:16:21,296
the roar
of the greasepaint already.

1346
01:16:21,421 --> 01:16:22,797
Oh, nonsense.

1347
01:16:22,921 --> 01:16:25,463
I've been too busy
to miss anything.

1348
01:16:25,588 --> 01:16:27,296
Oh, what tosh!

1349
01:16:27,421 --> 01:16:30,630
Little Lizzie without
an audience.

1350
01:16:30,755 --> 01:16:33,630
You mustn't let that
rotten man order you about so.

1351
01:16:33,755 --> 01:16:35,963
John is perfectly happy
for me to perform.

1352
01:16:36,088 --> 01:16:38,046
Still going to play the lead
in "Misery Junction."

1353
01:16:38,088 --> 01:16:39,797
Oh, come of it, Lizzie.

1354
01:16:39,921 --> 01:16:41,797
That man's so petrified
of failure

1355
01:16:41,921 --> 01:16:43,672
he'll never bring himself
to finish it.

1356
01:16:43,797 --> 01:16:45,963
He's writing every day
at the library.

1357
01:16:46,088 --> 01:16:47,630
It's almost complete.

1358
01:16:47,755 --> 01:16:49,963
I'm telling you as a friend,
Lizzie.

1359
01:16:50,088 --> 01:16:53,797
Forget "Misery Junction."
Forget John.

1360
01:16:53,921 --> 01:16:55,630
If you want your name
etched in stone,

1361
01:16:55,755 --> 01:17:00,130
you're gonna have to take up
the chisel yourself.

1362
01:17:00,255 --> 01:17:02,296
So, to what do we owe
the pleasure?

1363
01:17:02,421 --> 01:17:04,296
I'm actually here
to see Aveline.

1364
01:17:07,421 --> 01:17:09,797
I have a proposition
for you, dear.

1365
01:17:09,921 --> 01:17:12,296
I'm in need of a ladies' maid.

1366
01:17:12,421 --> 01:17:14,797
- Me?
- Mm-hmm.

1367
01:17:14,921 --> 01:17:16,463
You must be playing.

1368
01:17:16,588 --> 01:17:19,463
I can offer you twice the weekly
wage you're earning here.

1369
01:17:19,588 --> 01:17:22,839
What I require is some help
bearing the load of my...

1370
01:17:22,963 --> 01:17:24,839
my wifely duties.

1371
01:17:24,963 --> 01:17:27,463
Dear God, Lizzie.

1372
01:17:49,255 --> 01:17:51,630
Do you know how John's play
is coming along?

1373
01:17:51,755 --> 01:17:54,630
Very nicely, he tells me.

1374
01:17:54,755 --> 01:17:56,033
You know,
there's no need for you

1375
01:17:56,130 --> 01:17:58,963
to prepare his
nightly cordial, Lizzie.

1376
01:17:59,088 --> 01:18:00,463
I can do it.

1377
01:18:00,588 --> 01:18:01,963
I make one for myself.

1378
01:18:02,088 --> 01:18:03,963
It's no more effort
to prepare two.

1379
01:18:04,088 --> 01:18:06,296
I'd be happy to make both.

1380
01:18:06,421 --> 01:18:08,296
I could bring yours
to your quarters

1381
01:18:08,421 --> 01:18:10,963
before I take John's to his.

1382
01:19:19,421 --> 01:19:21,088
Mm.

1383
01:19:56,588 --> 01:19:58,130
What on earth
are you doing here?

1384
01:19:58,255 --> 01:19:59,534
I should ask you the same thing,

1385
01:19:59,588 --> 01:20:00,463
because I know what it is
you're not doing,

1386
01:20:00,588 --> 01:20:01,963
and that is writing.

1387
01:20:02,088 --> 01:20:03,730
Why tell me "Misery Junction"
was not finished

1388
01:20:03,754 --> 01:20:05,463
when it was hardly even begun?
It was!

1389
01:20:05,588 --> 01:20:08,630
It's nearly complete.
I've just put it aside for now.

1390
01:20:08,754 --> 01:20:10,630
Put it aside?

1391
01:20:10,754 --> 01:20:11,963
I support you financially.

1392
01:20:12,088 --> 01:20:13,397
I allow that your
every need is met!

1393
01:20:13,421 --> 01:20:15,963
Oh, don't pillory me
about my damn play

1394
01:20:16,088 --> 01:20:18,296
if what really irks you
is Aveline.

1395
01:20:18,421 --> 01:20:21,296
Why would that irk me?

1396
01:20:21,421 --> 01:20:23,296
Go home, Lizzie.

1397
01:20:23,421 --> 01:20:25,130
Let me finish my research.

1398
01:20:25,255 --> 01:20:26,630
Your research?

1399
01:20:26,754 --> 01:20:28,463
Into what?

1400
01:20:28,588 --> 01:20:29,671
My play.

1401
01:20:29,796 --> 01:20:32,630
My new play.

1402
01:20:32,754 --> 01:20:34,796
But what of "Misery Junction"?

1403
01:20:34,921 --> 01:20:37,796
I grew tired of Katherine Dove.

1404
01:20:37,921 --> 01:20:39,796
Is there a role in it for me?

1405
01:20:39,921 --> 01:20:40,796
No, Lizzie.

1406
01:20:40,921 --> 01:20:42,630
There is not.

1407
01:20:42,754 --> 01:20:44,463
You're a lady now,

1408
01:20:44,588 --> 01:20:47,463
and the stage
is no place for a lady.

1409
01:20:55,296 --> 01:20:58,796
You staged it without permission
and it was poorly received.

1410
01:20:58,921 --> 01:21:02,630
"'Misery Junction' leaves
audience in misery, indeed."

1411
01:21:02,754 --> 01:21:04,796
Isn't it funny how
the savage reviews are the ones

1412
01:21:04,921 --> 01:21:06,463
you can recall word for word?

1413
01:21:11,754 --> 01:21:13,296
More! More!

1414
01:21:13,421 --> 01:21:14,796
Uncle, please.

1415
01:21:14,921 --> 01:21:16,296
You have stolen my honor!

1416
01:21:16,421 --> 01:21:17,671
I am innocent!

1417
01:21:17,796 --> 01:21:19,130
You wish to be a man?

1418
01:21:19,255 --> 01:21:20,796
Just pretend that I'm a woman!

1419
01:21:20,921 --> 01:21:22,505
It's Lizzie they're mocking,
John.

1420
01:21:22,629 --> 01:21:24,171
It's not your play.

1421
01:21:24,296 --> 01:21:25,796
You lie!
This was not for me!

1422
01:21:25,921 --> 01:21:27,130
This was for you!

1423
01:21:27,255 --> 01:21:28,772
You wish to prove
yourself as an actress,

1424
01:21:28,796 --> 01:21:30,838
you selfish whore,
and you failed even at that!

1425
01:21:30,963 --> 01:21:32,671
You are the failure.

1426
01:21:32,796 --> 01:21:34,838
- Jesus!
- See?

1427
01:21:34,963 --> 01:21:36,322
Where's the white knight now,
John?

1428
01:21:36,421 --> 01:21:37,796
You are just as all men.

1429
01:21:37,921 --> 01:21:39,130
One more word from your mouth

1430
01:21:39,255 --> 01:21:40,605
and I will snap
your wretched neck!

1431
01:21:40,629 --> 01:21:42,796
John, go home.

1432
01:21:42,921 --> 01:21:45,671
My play was unfinished
and you destroyed it!

1433
01:21:45,796 --> 01:21:48,338
Destroyed me and my reputation!

1434
01:21:48,463 --> 01:21:49,629
You don't have a reputation!

1435
01:21:49,754 --> 01:21:51,296
Who do you believe
yourself to be?

1436
01:21:51,421 --> 01:21:54,629
You are nobody, John, nobody,
and you never will be!

1437
01:21:54,754 --> 01:21:56,463
Get out of here, John.

1438
01:21:56,587 --> 01:21:59,296
Out!

1439
01:21:59,421 --> 01:22:00,296
Look at you both.

1440
01:22:00,421 --> 01:22:01,963
You're clowns.

1441
01:22:02,088 --> 01:22:03,796
Worthless clowns.

1442
01:22:03,921 --> 01:22:07,171
You're the ones who'll
be forgotten, not me.

1443
01:22:07,296 --> 01:22:09,338
Not me.

1444
01:22:12,255 --> 01:22:14,463
Whoa! Whoa!

1445
01:22:14,587 --> 01:22:16,064
- John?
- Drive on.

1446
01:22:16,088 --> 01:22:17,106
- John.
- Giddyup!

1447
01:22:17,130 --> 01:22:19,004
John.

1448
01:22:19,130 --> 01:22:21,463
John.

1449
01:22:21,587 --> 01:22:22,796
John!

1450
01:22:22,921 --> 01:22:24,796
That opening night,
September the 5th,

1451
01:22:24,921 --> 01:22:27,629
it drove him over the edge,
but not to suicide.

1452
01:22:27,754 --> 01:22:30,130
It drove him to prove to
the world that he was an artist.

1453
01:22:30,255 --> 01:22:32,338
That night, the Golem
made his first kill,

1454
01:22:32,463 --> 01:22:34,463
and you think it's your fault.

1455
01:22:34,587 --> 01:22:35,730
You are putting words
in my mouth.

1456
01:22:35,754 --> 01:22:37,296
Why this dance, Lizzie?

1457
01:22:37,421 --> 01:22:39,296
Why won't you admit
that you came to know

1458
01:22:39,421 --> 01:22:40,963
or at least suspect
what he'd become?

1459
01:22:41,088 --> 01:22:43,130
If this is a dance,
it is you who is leading.

1460
01:22:43,255 --> 01:22:46,963
Let me read you the last entry.

1461
01:22:47,088 --> 01:22:49,296
"Ratcliffe Highway was
a tour de force."

1462
01:22:49,421 --> 01:22:52,629
And as an actor may take home
a program as a souvenir,

1463
01:22:52,754 --> 01:22:55,463
so I returned with
a blood-soaked shawl

1464
01:22:55,587 --> 01:22:57,463
belonging to the clothes
seller's wife.

1465
01:22:57,587 --> 01:22:59,796
The next night,
fearful of discovery,

1466
01:22:59,921 --> 01:23:01,629
I ventured to destroy it,

1467
01:23:01,754 --> 01:23:04,255
and therein lay my mistake.

1468
01:23:07,754 --> 01:23:09,296
John, you're home.

1469
01:23:09,421 --> 01:23:11,255
I didn't hear you come in.

1470
01:23:19,255 --> 01:23:23,255
There were no questions
asked, no recriminations.

1471
01:23:32,421 --> 01:23:35,754
I believe a homemade punishment
may be planned for me instead.

1472
01:23:58,462 --> 01:24:01,255
I no longer feel safe
under my own roof.

1473
01:24:03,921 --> 01:24:06,462
I cannot go on like this.

1474
01:24:08,587 --> 01:24:11,296
You poisoned him, didn't you?

1475
01:24:14,921 --> 01:24:16,838
Lizzie, listen to me.
We have a few minutes.

1476
01:24:16,963 --> 01:24:18,671
You can still change your plea.
Confess.

1477
01:24:18,796 --> 01:24:20,355
You did it because
you knew what he was.

1478
01:24:20,421 --> 01:24:22,629
You did it because you were
in fear for your life.

1479
01:24:22,754 --> 01:24:24,629
I promise you'll have
the sympathy of the jury.

1480
01:24:24,754 --> 01:24:26,296
I don't want their sympathy.

1481
01:24:26,421 --> 01:24:28,296
Why do you not
deserve redemption?

1482
01:24:28,421 --> 01:24:29,897
Because you killed him
or because you believe

1483
01:24:29,921 --> 01:24:30,963
you created a monster?

1484
01:24:31,088 --> 01:24:32,629
What I deserve is
to live freely,

1485
01:24:32,754 --> 01:24:34,563
and in death be remembered
for my accomplishments,

1486
01:24:34,587 --> 01:24:36,462
not as the wife
who poisoned her husband,

1487
01:24:36,587 --> 01:24:38,838
my name forever tethered to his.

1488
01:24:38,963 --> 01:24:39,838
Mrs. Cree.

1489
01:24:42,255 --> 01:24:43,963
While that chance remains,
I have no choice

1490
01:24:44,088 --> 01:24:45,838
but to cling to it.

1491
01:24:52,255 --> 01:24:54,296
Have the jury reached a verdict?

1492
01:24:54,420 --> 01:24:56,130
Yes, my lord.

1493
01:24:56,255 --> 01:24:59,130
How do the jury
find the defendant?

1494
01:24:59,255 --> 01:25:00,838
Guilty.

1495
01:25:00,963 --> 01:25:02,629
Order!

1496
01:25:02,754 --> 01:25:04,629
Order!

1497
01:25:04,754 --> 01:25:08,671
Elizabeth Cree, you will be
returned to prison

1498
01:25:08,796 --> 01:25:11,796
and taken from there
to a place of execution,

1499
01:25:11,921 --> 01:25:13,629
where at 10:00 tomorrow morning,

1500
01:25:13,754 --> 01:25:16,963
you will be hanged by the neck
until you are dead.

1501
01:25:17,088 --> 01:25:19,796
May the Lord have mercy
on your soul.

1502
01:25:19,921 --> 01:25:21,629
Inspector Kildare,
Scotland Yard.

1503
01:25:21,754 --> 01:25:23,255
I need a moment with her,
please.

1504
01:25:27,420 --> 01:25:28,504
You don't deserve this.

1505
01:25:28,629 --> 01:25:30,028
It's done.
I hang tomorrow at 10:00.

1506
01:25:30,088 --> 01:25:31,796
No.
I won't let it happen.

1507
01:25:31,921 --> 01:25:33,338
John Cree was a murderer.

1508
01:25:33,462 --> 01:25:35,629
I mean to prove it
and appeal for your pardon.

1509
01:25:35,754 --> 01:25:37,671
The world needs
to know the truth.

1510
01:25:43,921 --> 01:25:45,504
I'd like for you
to unmask the Golem.

1511
01:25:45,629 --> 01:25:47,338
This is your moment,
your chance.

1512
01:25:47,462 --> 01:25:49,064
I'd like for you to have that.

1513
01:25:49,088 --> 01:25:50,366
I'm sorry, sir.
We need to leave.

1514
01:25:53,420 --> 01:25:55,004
We don't have much time.

1515
01:25:55,130 --> 01:25:56,939
The manuscript of "Misery
Junction" is handwritten.

1516
01:25:56,963 --> 01:25:58,171
Dan may still have it.

1517
01:25:58,296 --> 01:26:00,629
I shall stop this.
I promise you.

1518
01:26:05,754 --> 01:26:08,462
You filthy...

1519
01:26:23,296 --> 01:26:25,754
Here we are again!

1520
01:26:27,629 --> 01:26:30,629
Lizzie paid for the hire
of the theatre.

1521
01:26:30,754 --> 01:26:33,629
I advised her against it,
but she was adamant.

1522
01:26:33,754 --> 01:26:35,004
And it was not a success.

1523
01:26:36,963 --> 01:26:38,629
That's putting it mildly.

1524
01:26:38,754 --> 01:26:41,171
So put it any way that you will.

1525
01:26:41,295 --> 01:26:42,838
Barely any tickets sold,

1526
01:26:42,963 --> 01:26:45,796
but Lizzie insisted
on a full house,

1527
01:26:45,921 --> 01:26:48,963
so she took to the streets
and gave them away to the poor.

1528
01:26:51,420 --> 01:26:52,420
Ah.

1529
01:26:58,088 --> 01:27:00,462
Aha! Here it is.

1530
01:27:00,587 --> 01:27:02,963
"Misery Junction."

1531
01:27:06,587 --> 01:27:09,295
It's typeset.

1532
01:27:09,420 --> 01:27:12,462
Oh, I don't have the original
manuscript, I'm afraid.

1533
01:27:12,587 --> 01:27:14,629
A usual practice is
to have it archived,

1534
01:27:14,754 --> 01:27:16,963
unless the author asks
for it back, which he didn't.

1535
01:27:17,088 --> 01:27:19,004
Archived... Where?

1536
01:27:19,130 --> 01:27:22,462
The librarian agreed
to open up early, sir.

1537
01:27:22,587 --> 01:27:24,130
He should be here any moment.

1538
01:27:24,254 --> 01:27:25,629
I pray he is.

1539
01:27:25,754 --> 01:27:27,504
They hang her at 10:00.

1540
01:27:45,921 --> 01:27:48,963
Lizzie!

1541
01:27:49,088 --> 01:27:50,963
Lizzie!

1542
01:27:52,754 --> 01:27:55,420
Lizzie!

1543
01:28:01,088 --> 01:28:02,295
Lizzie.

1544
01:28:02,420 --> 01:28:03,629
I'm ready.

1545
01:28:17,629 --> 01:28:19,295
But this is most odd.

1546
01:28:19,420 --> 01:28:20,419
Should be here.

1547
01:28:20,462 --> 01:28:22,462
Could someone have withdrawn it?

1548
01:28:22,587 --> 01:28:25,337
Not unless they did so just now.

1549
01:28:25,462 --> 01:28:26,671
Quickly, the door.

1550
01:28:26,796 --> 01:28:28,254
Sir!

1551
01:28:33,295 --> 01:28:35,462
Unhand me!
I've done nothing wrong.

1552
01:28:35,587 --> 01:28:38,295
Then perhaps you can tell us
why the hurry to obtain this?

1553
01:28:38,420 --> 01:28:40,462
I plan to rewrite it, sir.

1554
01:28:40,587 --> 01:28:41,629
Demand a production.

1555
01:28:41,754 --> 01:28:44,504
A topical shocker
about Lizzie Cree.

1556
01:28:44,629 --> 01:28:46,504
Now she's to be hanged,
it'll be a smash.

1557
01:28:46,629 --> 01:28:47,897
Really?
So you're a writer now,

1558
01:28:47,921 --> 01:28:48,963
are you, Miss Ortega?

1559
01:28:49,088 --> 01:28:50,295
No, sir.

1560
01:28:50,420 --> 01:28:52,629
But it won't require much work.

1561
01:28:52,754 --> 01:28:54,796
It was the story of her life,
after all.

1562
01:28:54,921 --> 01:28:58,130
My idea is to begin
the play at the gallows,

1563
01:28:58,254 --> 01:29:00,170
then retrace each step
that led her to them.

1564
01:29:00,295 --> 01:29:03,130
I cannot help but think that the
addition of a murderous husband

1565
01:29:03,254 --> 01:29:04,462
might be popular.

1566
01:29:04,587 --> 01:29:07,629
I told you all I know, sir.

1567
01:29:07,754 --> 01:29:09,462
John is innocent.

1568
01:29:44,587 --> 01:29:45,796
Jesus!

1569
01:29:45,921 --> 01:29:48,462
You're the ones
who'll be forgotten!

1570
01:29:48,587 --> 01:29:49,587
Not me.

1571
01:29:56,587 --> 01:29:57,796
Is it time?

1572
01:29:57,921 --> 01:29:59,963
There's no one here.

1573
01:30:00,088 --> 01:30:02,629
They hardly ever admit the
public these days, Mrs. Cree.

1574
01:30:02,754 --> 01:30:04,796
Only for the most hated.

1575
01:30:04,921 --> 01:30:07,170
Please, no.
You must help me.

1576
01:30:07,295 --> 01:30:08,796
Please.
Please tell them to wait.

1577
01:30:08,921 --> 01:30:11,004
- Inspector Kildare is coming.
- I'm sorry.

1578
01:30:11,129 --> 01:30:13,462
Can't you go any faster?

1579
01:30:13,587 --> 01:30:14,730
Prison's just around the corner.

1580
01:30:14,754 --> 01:30:15,796
I know!

1581
01:30:15,921 --> 01:30:17,796
No, we must wait
for him, please.

1582
01:30:17,921 --> 01:30:19,159
This is wrong!
He will prove it!

1583
01:30:19,254 --> 01:30:20,533
I beg you, just a little longer!

1584
01:30:20,587 --> 01:30:22,462
I'm sorry.

1585
01:30:26,462 --> 01:30:27,963
Come on!

1586
01:30:52,921 --> 01:30:54,170
Coming through.

1587
01:31:00,254 --> 01:31:01,963
Steady, sir.

1588
01:31:02,087 --> 01:31:03,396
- Who are you here for?
- Elizabeth Cree.

1589
01:31:03,420 --> 01:31:04,796
Say I'm not too late.

1590
01:31:04,921 --> 01:31:07,629
They're just taking her down.
Quick as you can.

1591
01:31:07,754 --> 01:31:09,129
Send for the magistrate!

1592
01:31:13,587 --> 01:31:15,963
Stop! Stop!

1593
01:31:26,254 --> 01:31:27,629
Don't thank me yet.

1594
01:31:27,754 --> 01:31:28,939
All they've given me
is an hour's grace

1595
01:31:28,963 --> 01:31:30,462
to speak to the magistrate.

1596
01:31:30,587 --> 01:31:32,396
I've still to convince him
to reduce your sentence.

1597
01:31:32,420 --> 01:31:33,963
Don't be glum.

1598
01:31:34,087 --> 01:31:35,629
You have the Golem.

1599
01:31:35,754 --> 01:31:38,963
The world will know
the real story, and it's you...

1600
01:31:39,087 --> 01:31:43,796
you who will know every chapter,
who will tell it.

1601
01:31:43,921 --> 01:31:45,462
You have my gratitude.
Always.

1602
01:31:45,587 --> 01:31:48,254
And you mine.

1603
01:31:54,087 --> 01:31:56,587
Lizzie, Lizzie, don't.

1604
01:32:01,087 --> 01:32:03,366
Could any believe John
Cree capable of such deeds?

1605
01:32:03,420 --> 01:32:05,462
I guarantee it.

1606
01:32:05,587 --> 01:32:06,754
Have no doubt.

1607
01:32:09,796 --> 01:32:11,587
Then let us bring
this to an end.

1608
01:32:17,921 --> 01:32:20,629
Here's what you will write.

1609
01:32:20,754 --> 01:32:24,796
"I am Elizabeth Cree,
and in September of this year,

1610
01:32:24,921 --> 01:32:29,504
I came to know that my husband
was the Limehouse Golem."

1611
01:32:29,629 --> 01:32:31,629
All you need to do
is tell the truth.

1612
01:32:34,420 --> 01:32:37,254
I have never told you anything
but the truth, Kildare.

1613
01:33:18,920 --> 01:33:20,962
You shall have your moment,
and I mine.

1614
01:33:24,920 --> 01:33:27,318
In the temple of fame, our names
will be written side-by-side

1615
01:33:27,420 --> 01:33:28,920
in stone for all time.

1616
01:33:38,587 --> 01:33:40,629
Who was here
on September the 24th?

1617
01:33:40,754 --> 01:33:42,896
There were four men
in the reading room that day,

1618
01:33:42,920 --> 01:33:44,359
but there's no earthly way
of knowing

1619
01:33:44,420 --> 01:33:46,754
what anyone read
or when they read it.

1620
01:33:51,295 --> 01:33:53,003
John. You're home.

1621
01:33:53,129 --> 01:33:54,462
I didn't hear you come in.

1622
01:33:57,754 --> 01:34:02,462
There were no questions asked,
no recriminations.

1623
01:34:02,587 --> 01:34:05,754
I believe a homemade punishment
may be planned for me instead.

1624
01:34:08,087 --> 01:34:10,129
I no longer feel safe
under my own roof.

1625
01:34:10,254 --> 01:34:12,920
I cannot go on like this.

1626
01:34:15,796 --> 01:34:18,295
Still, we had agreement
to keep each other's secrets.

1627
01:34:18,420 --> 01:34:19,962
And you didn't keep mine,
did you?

1628
01:34:20,087 --> 01:34:22,129
I wonder what I should do
with yours.

1629
01:34:22,254 --> 01:34:23,962
I think you should take it
to the grave.

1630
01:34:29,254 --> 01:34:30,629
Aah!

1631
01:35:00,754 --> 01:35:02,420
Mr. Gerrard, sir?

1632
01:35:18,754 --> 01:35:20,170
Annie?

1633
01:35:38,420 --> 01:35:39,962
Oh, I know, I know.

1634
01:35:40,087 --> 01:35:42,295
Few would think a woman
capable of such artistry.

1635
01:36:04,920 --> 01:36:06,295
Here we are again!

1636
01:36:52,920 --> 01:36:54,129
You were too late?

1637
01:36:57,420 --> 01:36:58,962
This, um...

1638
01:36:59,087 --> 01:37:01,295
This is probably the last thing
you want at present,

1639
01:37:01,420 --> 01:37:04,962
but they're waiting
for you downstairs.

1640
01:37:05,087 --> 01:37:07,129
You're about to be
the toast of London, John.

1641
01:37:14,420 --> 01:37:16,795
I know how much you cared
for her.

1642
01:37:16,920 --> 01:37:18,962
Just...

1643
01:37:19,087 --> 01:37:21,462
know how grateful she would
be that the world

1644
01:37:21,587 --> 01:37:24,629
will know what her
bastard husband really was.

1645
01:37:24,753 --> 01:37:27,795
Not just as a murderer, but as
a man who sought to deny her

1646
01:37:27,920 --> 01:37:29,795
all she wanted to be.

1647
01:37:29,920 --> 01:37:32,254
It's you who saved her honor.

1648
01:37:34,587 --> 01:37:35,920
Her memory.

1649
01:37:38,629 --> 01:37:40,587
She would've wanted you
to have this.

1650
01:37:58,753 --> 01:38:00,628
No! We must wait
for him. Please!

1651
01:38:00,753 --> 01:38:01,771
This is wrong, he will prove it!

1652
01:38:01,795 --> 01:38:03,063
I beg you, just a little longer!

1653
01:38:03,087 --> 01:38:05,670
I...

1654
01:38:05,795 --> 01:38:10,337
I don't believe Inspector
Kildare will be coming back.

1655
01:38:16,087 --> 01:38:17,295
I am not a poisoner.

1656
01:38:17,420 --> 01:38:18,795
I believe you.

1657
01:38:18,920 --> 01:38:20,670
I am so much more.

1658
01:38:20,795 --> 01:38:24,837
We shall be issuing
our full report on John Cree

1659
01:38:24,962 --> 01:38:26,295
in an hour, gentlemen.

1660
01:38:26,420 --> 01:38:29,962
Well.
It seems the show must go on.

1661
01:38:30,087 --> 01:38:33,795
Londoners can sleep easy
in their beds again.

1662
01:38:33,920 --> 01:38:35,504
The Golem is no more.

1663
01:38:35,628 --> 01:38:37,063
Inspector! Inspector,

1664
01:38:37,087 --> 01:38:39,462
any comments
on your promotion, sir?

1665
01:38:42,254 --> 01:38:43,462
Any last words?

1666
01:38:43,586 --> 01:38:45,504
Here we are again!

1667
01:40:08,920 --> 01:40:13,129
Let us begin, my friends,

1668
01:40:13,254 --> 01:40:15,628
at the end.

1669
01:41:08,753 --> 01:41:10,962
N-not the green, love, the red.

1670
01:41:11,087 --> 01:41:13,962
Mother doesn't get sick
until scene four.

1671
01:41:20,920 --> 01:41:22,628
Did anyone check the safety?

1672
01:41:34,254 --> 01:41:35,670
Take her weight. Take...

1673
01:41:40,586 --> 01:41:41,920
What's going on?

1674
01:41:43,419 --> 01:41:44,461
Is she breathing?

1675
01:41:50,753 --> 01:41:54,295
We have to get back out there.

1676
01:41:54,419 --> 01:41:57,003
You're Lizzie's mother now.

1677
01:42:11,254 --> 01:42:12,962
I'll be Lizzie.

1678
01:42:52,295 --> 01:42:54,962
