1
00:01:21,998 --> 00:01:24,212
I'm gonna have to carry you, huh?

2
00:01:59,142 --> 00:02:02,067
There. There you go, boy.

3
00:03:02,443 --> 00:03:03,989
Drop the gun belt, mister.

4
00:03:04,198 --> 00:03:05,786
What's this all about?

5
00:03:06,204 --> 00:03:08,460
The captain said to drop the gun belt!

6
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:10,256
Now!

7
00:03:23,084 --> 00:03:26,217
They're wearin' the Johanson brand,
all right, Captain Wilson.

8
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:27,805
Whose else would they be?

9
00:03:27,888 --> 00:03:29,686
Where did you get those cattle, mister?

10
00:03:29,811 --> 00:03:31,106
Where that brand says.

11
00:03:31,231 --> 00:03:33,530
- Got 'em from Johanson, eh?
- That's right.

12
00:03:33,565 --> 00:03:35,618
And you've got a bill of sale to prove it.

13
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:36,830
Hold it!

14
00:03:39,462 --> 00:03:40,465
That's right.

15
00:03:40,842 --> 00:03:43,641
Thought maybe you'd like to look
at the bill of sale.

16
00:03:44,643 --> 00:03:46,440
We'll look at it.

17
00:04:01,148 --> 00:04:02,944
You say you got this from Johanson?

18
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:06,370
Mr. Maddow...

19
00:04:15,688 --> 00:04:18,111
Mr. Maddow, is that Johanson's mark?

20
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:25,215
Johanson didn't have to make his mark.

21
00:04:26,343 --> 00:04:28,222
He could write as good as you can.

22
00:04:32,818 --> 00:04:33,738
Hang him!

23
00:05:27,721 --> 00:05:29,100
I'm an ex-lawman.

24
00:05:29,309 --> 00:05:30,855
You can check with the sheriff...

25
00:05:30,938 --> 00:05:32,443
...Dave Ramsey, in St. Louis.

26
00:05:37,122 --> 00:05:38,542
Get Johanson.

27
00:05:38,752 --> 00:05:40,339
Let him tell me face-to-face.

28
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:43,682
For God's sake, check it out!

29
00:05:55,088 --> 00:05:57,386
Are we gonna hang him,
or beat him to death?

30
00:05:59,476 --> 00:06:00,479
Put him on his horse.

31
00:06:00,562 --> 00:06:02,317
Wait a minute. The saddle.

32
00:06:02,777 --> 00:06:04,197
You've no claim to that, Reno!

33
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:07,916
We got back Johanson's cattle.
And we got the man who took 'em.

34
00:06:07,957 --> 00:06:09,587
I like to see justice done, but...

35
00:06:09,629 --> 00:06:11,007
...I'm taking the saddle.

36
00:06:11,592 --> 00:06:12,720
Anybody want to argue?

37
00:06:12,805 --> 00:06:15,395
If he's a rustler,
he ain't got nothin' I'd want.

38
00:06:16,732 --> 00:06:18,821
He's got something that I want.

39
00:06:18,988 --> 00:06:22,205
I want his wallet.
I want it, and I'm gonna take it.

40
00:06:22,748 --> 00:06:24,211
Captain, if he is a rustler...

41
00:06:24,419 --> 00:06:27,637
...how come he didn't make a run for it
when he had a chance?

42
00:06:28,807 --> 00:06:30,645
Wait a minute, Loomis.

43
00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:35,032
Now, tell me...

44
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:37,832
...you bought some cattle from Johanson?

45
00:06:39,838 --> 00:06:42,386
You saw the bill of sale.

46
00:06:42,637 --> 00:06:45,770
With the mark where Johanson
was supposed to write his name.

47
00:06:48,988 --> 00:06:50,576
What did Johanson look like?

48
00:06:53,082 --> 00:06:56,801
He's about 30, dark hair,
dark eyes, heavyset...

49
00:06:57,804 --> 00:06:59,475
...pock-marked face...

50
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:01,607
...regular features.

51
00:07:02,985 --> 00:07:05,408
You have an eye for detail, haven't you?

52
00:07:05,909 --> 00:07:07,999
I told you I was a lawman.

53
00:07:08,207 --> 00:07:09,294
It was my job.

54
00:07:09,712 --> 00:07:12,010
Heavyset, pock-marked...

55
00:07:12,888 --> 00:07:14,016
...about 30...

56
00:07:16,104 --> 00:07:17,107
Liar!

57
00:07:19,907 --> 00:07:21,703
Johanson was 60.

58
00:07:32,316 --> 00:07:34,740
Maybe it was his foreman
or something. I don't know.

59
00:07:34,865 --> 00:07:37,748
But we can go back there and find out.
It's only a day's ride.

60
00:07:37,873 --> 00:07:39,544
We could check it out.

61
00:07:39,754 --> 00:07:41,091
Mr. Maddow...

62
00:07:41,884 --> 00:07:42,887
...tell him.

63
00:07:44,976 --> 00:07:48,486
I just came from the Johanson place.
His herd was gone.

64
00:07:49,781 --> 00:07:53,291
Found Johanson and his wife
on the kitchen floor, gunned down...

65
00:07:55,296 --> 00:07:56,091
...dead!

66
00:08:01,522 --> 00:08:03,778
- Hang him!
- You're makin' a mistake!

67
00:10:13,555 --> 00:10:17,231
Some people call this hell,
but you're still in Oklahoma Territory.

68
00:10:19,572 --> 00:10:20,616
Save your breath.

69
00:10:21,535 --> 00:10:23,541
I don't know who hung you, or why.

70
00:10:23,583 --> 00:10:26,424
But if you're innocent,
the judge will set you free.

71
00:10:27,384 --> 00:10:28,639
And, if you ain't...

72
00:10:29,265 --> 00:10:32,065
...we'll have to take the trouble
of hanging you again.

73
00:10:32,983 --> 00:10:34,279
Come on, get on your feet.

74
00:14:59,347 --> 00:15:03,066
Water your mules and fill up
a bucket of water for the men.

75
00:15:13,261 --> 00:15:15,977
Marshal Dave Bliss.
I hear you got a prisoner for me.

76
00:15:16,012 --> 00:15:17,063
That's right, Marshal.

77
00:15:17,272 --> 00:15:19,570
Feed and grain store,
right across the street.

78
00:15:19,696 --> 00:15:21,910
Here's the key, you'll be needing it.

79
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,781
Watch out for him.
He's plumb loco.

80
00:16:22,578 --> 00:16:23,873
Oh, God!

81
00:16:30,224 --> 00:16:31,895
You've come to kill the prophet.

82
00:16:32,397 --> 00:16:34,110
Take it easy, will ya?

83
00:16:36,116 --> 00:16:37,620
You've come to kill the prophet.

84
00:16:37,829 --> 00:16:39,040
Can you walk?

85
00:16:39,291 --> 00:16:41,631
They're against me! They spy on me.

86
00:16:41,714 --> 00:16:45,307
Oh, God, they're scared
of the wrath of God.

87
00:16:47,313 --> 00:16:50,113
Come on, even the prison wagon
is better than this.

88
00:16:50,238 --> 00:16:52,118
You've come to kill the prophet!

89
00:16:52,745 --> 00:16:54,124
Hold it!

90
00:17:00,266 --> 00:17:02,564
You've come to kill the prophet!

91
00:17:02,857 --> 00:17:04,152
Stop, or I'll kill you!

92
00:17:06,158 --> 00:17:09,082
What are you waiting for, Marshal?
Shoot him! Kill him!

93
00:17:09,291 --> 00:17:12,550
What's wrong, Marshal?
Scared of cheating the hanging judge?

94
00:17:16,101 --> 00:17:17,480
Kill him!

95
00:17:21,491 --> 00:17:23,371
We'll testify for you, Marshal.

96
00:17:23,581 --> 00:17:26,380
We'll tell 'em you did your best
to bring him in alive.

97
00:17:34,945 --> 00:17:35,948
Hold it, damn you!

98
00:17:35,983 --> 00:17:39,207
Kill him, Marshal!
It's too damn crowded in here, anyway!

99
00:18:30,892 --> 00:18:33,817
You chained him. Now, you bury him.

100
00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:43,134
That ain't gonna make the judge happy.

101
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:46,059
What was I supposed to do,
let him escape?

102
00:18:46,518 --> 00:18:47,856
I ain't sayin' it was wrong.

103
00:18:47,939 --> 00:18:50,279
I'm just sayin' it ain't gonna make
the judge happy.

104
00:18:50,321 --> 00:18:52,953
Now that you've said it, William,
move 'em out.

105
00:19:31,936 --> 00:19:35,237
Girls, girls, the tumbleweed wagon's here.

106
00:19:35,948 --> 00:19:38,162
Save us the live ones, Marshal, huh?

107
00:19:39,332 --> 00:19:40,544
Don't hang them all!

108
00:19:44,973 --> 00:19:46,769
Here comes the tumbleweed wagon.

109
00:19:46,853 --> 00:19:48,649
Some collection, Dave!

110
00:19:55,042 --> 00:19:57,047
And you'll send the drapery material over.

111
00:19:57,172 --> 00:19:58,594
As soon as it comes in.

112
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:01,602
- I'll be needing more perfume.
- A dozen bottles?

113
00:20:01,685 --> 00:20:04,067
The cheapest, as long as it smells good.

114
00:20:04,192 --> 00:20:05,279
It's not for my girls.

115
00:20:05,321 --> 00:20:08,580
It's for the Saturday night cowhands.
They come off the range smelling...

116
00:20:08,663 --> 00:20:10,418
Here comes the tumbleweed wagon!

117
00:20:10,585 --> 00:20:12,214
Isn't that Billy the Kid?

118
00:20:13,301 --> 00:20:16,225
Take a closer look.
Maybe you'll find your old man!

119
00:20:32,312 --> 00:20:33,733
Hold it!

120
00:20:34,861 --> 00:20:38,329
Let them step down,
so we can target practice on 'em.

121
00:21:33,231 --> 00:21:35,153
All right, move 'em out.

122
00:22:26,253 --> 00:22:27,924
Come on.

123
00:23:35,570 --> 00:23:36,782
Feed's twice a day.

124
00:23:37,032 --> 00:23:39,373
Eight in the morning,
four in the afternoon.

125
00:23:39,456 --> 00:23:41,837
Unless you make trouble
and get yourselves short-chained...

126
00:23:41,963 --> 00:23:45,055
...you get an hour a day recreation
in the prison yard.

127
00:23:48,773 --> 00:23:50,403
Better find yourself a spot.

128
00:23:50,486 --> 00:23:52,785
We're expecting another wagon in
this afternoon.

129
00:23:54,498 --> 00:23:55,793
You'll get used to the smell.

130
00:23:55,876 --> 00:23:59,679
If you don't, they got a sure cure for it:
They hang you!

131
00:24:22,241 --> 00:24:26,335
Sounds like Schmidt's fixin' to have
a little party this morning.

132
00:24:29,344 --> 00:24:30,472
A party?

133
00:24:31,349 --> 00:24:32,477
A hanging party.

134
00:24:35,068 --> 00:24:37,659
Them's 200-pound sacks he's droppin'.

135
00:24:38,076 --> 00:24:40,291
Gotta make sure them ropes hold up.

136
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:43,675
Always uses top-grade hemp,
Schmidt does.

137
00:24:44,678 --> 00:24:47,686
Oils it, so it slides real good.

138
00:24:48,188 --> 00:24:51,363
Snaps your neck like a dried-out twig.

139
00:24:51,907 --> 00:24:55,374
A fine artist at his
trade, our Mr. Schmidt.

140
00:25:00,806 --> 00:25:02,311
The bastard!

141
00:25:12,547 --> 00:25:17,018
What kind of justice, to hang a man
before he's heard about his appeal?

142
00:25:34,190 --> 00:25:35,570
Come in.

143
00:25:47,812 --> 00:25:50,068
Leave him, without shackles.

144
00:26:08,327 --> 00:26:09,915
All right, guard.

145
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:25,959
Your story checks out, Cooper.
You're free to go.

146
00:26:33,271 --> 00:26:34,358
$11?

147
00:26:34,566 --> 00:26:38,577
And 40 cents. That's all McCleod
had on him when we picked him up.

148
00:26:39,372 --> 00:26:40,875
McCleod?

149
00:26:41,168 --> 00:26:43,299
McCleod was running from the law.

150
00:26:43,884 --> 00:26:45,514
Holed up at Johanson's place...

151
00:26:45,597 --> 00:26:48,982
...killed that old man and his wife.
And then you blundered in.

152
00:26:49,608 --> 00:26:53,411
A stranger lookin' to buy some cattle.
So McCleod sold you a few head.

153
00:26:53,536 --> 00:26:56,126
He must have got
a pretty good laugh out of that.

154
00:26:56,210 --> 00:26:58,132
You want to see what he looks like?

155
00:26:58,925 --> 00:27:00,513
Come on. Come on.

156
00:27:23,577 --> 00:27:25,666
McCleod took the money
he swindled from you...

157
00:27:25,708 --> 00:27:28,047
...and came into town,
lookin' for a good time.

158
00:27:28,174 --> 00:27:30,388
The Row, that's where we found him.

159
00:28:08,911 --> 00:28:11,335
May God have mercy on his soul.

160
00:28:13,131 --> 00:28:14,844
You're free to go, Cooper.

161
00:28:18,939 --> 00:28:20,735
With my $11.40!

162
00:28:20,861 --> 00:28:24,371
And the satisfaction of seeing the man
that got you into this mess hung.

163
00:28:24,413 --> 00:28:27,170
What about the nine just men
who hung me?

164
00:28:28,382 --> 00:28:30,973
Just give their description
to one of the deputies downstairs.

165
00:28:31,098 --> 00:28:34,189
- They'll try to pick 'em up.
- Well, that's not good enough!

166
00:28:37,490 --> 00:28:39,287
You take the law into your own hands...

167
00:28:39,329 --> 00:28:42,797
...and I promise you, you'll swing
from one of those ropes out there.

168
00:28:43,507 --> 00:28:46,098
I know a little bit about the law,
Your Honor.

169
00:28:49,106 --> 00:28:50,401
That's right...

170
00:28:50,986 --> 00:28:52,197
...you do.

171
00:28:55,123 --> 00:28:56,209
Sit down, Cooper.

172
00:28:59,552 --> 00:29:00,345
Please...

173
00:29:12,253 --> 00:29:14,844
You were a lawman in St. Louis.

174
00:29:15,638 --> 00:29:16,849
A damn good one.

175
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:21,362
I can use a good man, Cooper.

176
00:29:22,365 --> 00:29:24,245
Pay, $250 a month.

177
00:29:25,081 --> 00:29:27,797
That's $230 more than
you'd make as a cowhand...

178
00:29:28,005 --> 00:29:31,264
...$232 more than
an army sergeant. Here.

179
00:29:31,599 --> 00:29:34,900
If that hanging rope didn't kill you,
maybe my coffee will.

180
00:29:35,275 --> 00:29:37,406
How much did you make in St. Louis?

181
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:41,501
It's $200 more than I made in St. Louis.

182
00:29:41,710 --> 00:29:44,008
$250 plus expenses.

183
00:29:47,226 --> 00:29:50,109
I warn you, the pay is
a little slow in coming.

184
00:29:51,529 --> 00:29:52,908
There.

185
00:29:53,702 --> 00:29:54,621
$200...

186
00:29:54,830 --> 00:29:58,339
...plus $50 President Harrison owes you.
You'll get it when I get it.

187
00:29:58,924 --> 00:30:00,262
You sound like you're a man...

188
00:30:00,637 --> 00:30:03,646
...trying to give away money
and don't have too many takers.

189
00:30:03,688 --> 00:30:06,864
You sound like you're a man protesting
the pay's too high. Don't.

190
00:30:06,947 --> 00:30:09,453
If you sign on, you'll
earn every cent of it.

191
00:30:09,872 --> 00:30:11,250
There you are.

192
00:30:11,459 --> 00:30:13,089
The Oklahoma and Indian Territory...

193
00:30:13,131 --> 00:30:16,557
...year of our Lord, 1889.
19 marshals.

194
00:30:17,267 --> 00:30:19,356
I was authorized 60 when I came here.

195
00:30:19,481 --> 00:30:21,904
I told the president
even that wasn't half enough.

196
00:30:21,946 --> 00:30:24,872
Nineteen marshals and one court...

197
00:30:25,164 --> 00:30:27,880
...to cover near 70,000 square miles.

198
00:30:28,590 --> 00:30:31,181
A happy hunting ground
filled with bushwhackers...

199
00:30:31,306 --> 00:30:33,980
...horse thieves, whiskey peddlers,
counterfeiters...

200
00:30:34,105 --> 00:30:37,531
...hide peelers, marauders
that'll kill you for a hatband.

201
00:30:37,615 --> 00:30:40,414
Now, that's why there's
a badge in my desk, Cooper.

202
00:30:40,582 --> 00:30:44,133
Itching to sit on somebody's chest,
and no takers.

203
00:30:46,933 --> 00:30:49,941
Your marshals do cover
a lot of territory.

204
00:30:50,150 --> 00:30:53,826
You'll ride circuit over an area
half again the size of Rhode Island.

205
00:30:53,868 --> 00:30:56,417
If and when it's Marshal Cooper!

206
00:30:58,548 --> 00:31:00,136
Pick up the badge, Mr. Cooper.

207
00:31:04,982 --> 00:31:08,367
Pick up the badge or leave justice
to me and my men.

208
00:31:19,398 --> 00:31:20,986
Those nine men...

209
00:31:21,779 --> 00:31:25,873
...if you find them,
they're to be brought before me, alive!

210
00:31:31,807 --> 00:31:34,105
That old horse should hold you for a spell.

211
00:31:36,696 --> 00:31:39,119
- Good luck, Marshal.
- Thank you.

212
00:32:25,121 --> 00:32:26,584
You're Cooper?

213
00:32:28,129 --> 00:32:30,929
Judge sent a wire you was coming.

214
00:32:31,515 --> 00:32:33,102
Wasn't there nobody outside?

215
00:32:34,105 --> 00:32:36,111
Two men with shotguns.

216
00:32:36,821 --> 00:32:40,122
I haven't had me a night's sleep
since we picked up the Swede.

217
00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:42,419
How many men did you bring with you?

218
00:32:43,130 --> 00:32:45,344
Can you have him ready to go
in a half hour?

219
00:32:46,807 --> 00:32:48,812
Just the two of you?

220
00:32:51,611 --> 00:32:54,160
The hotel here in town,
does it serve a good steak?

221
00:32:54,244 --> 00:32:56,458
I better have somethin' to eat
before we leave.

222
00:32:56,493 --> 00:32:59,759
If you're crazy enough
to try to take the Swede in alone...

223
00:33:00,386 --> 00:33:02,977
...you got a right to try it
on a full stomach.

224
00:34:15,511 --> 00:34:17,517
You're under arrest, Reno.

225
00:34:21,528 --> 00:34:22,990
You're talking to me, Marshal?

226
00:34:23,116 --> 00:34:24,703
Your name's Reno, isn't it?

227
00:34:27,795 --> 00:34:29,926
I don't know what kind of town
you're running...

228
00:34:29,968 --> 00:34:32,391
- This isn't my town.
- Well, I wouldn't know.

229
00:34:32,599 --> 00:34:34,021
See, I just rode in.

230
00:34:34,731 --> 00:34:37,155
I want to wash down
some trail dust, and...

231
00:34:49,229 --> 00:34:51,652
All right, Marshal,
what do you say I done?

232
00:34:53,365 --> 00:34:55,037
You don't remember me, do you?

233
00:34:57,794 --> 00:35:00,469
When you hang a man,
you better look at him!

234
00:35:10,998 --> 00:35:12,795
Don't go for that gun, Reno.

235
00:35:13,088 --> 00:35:14,801
I need you alive.

236
00:35:51,067 --> 00:35:52,363
- You know him?
- No.

237
00:35:54,076 --> 00:35:56,749
Anybody here know him?
Goes by the name of Reno.

238
00:35:56,876 --> 00:35:58,881
Come up here and take a look at him.

239
00:35:59,173 --> 00:36:00,552
He must've just rode in.

240
00:36:00,761 --> 00:36:03,184
That's what he said.
How much to bury him?

241
00:36:05,482 --> 00:36:07,780
$15 ought to do a fair job, Marshal.

242
00:36:09,118 --> 00:36:11,791
There's $7 there. I'll give you $8 more.

243
00:36:12,293 --> 00:36:14,006
And mark it down, there.

244
00:36:16,513 --> 00:36:18,017
Don't anybody leave!

245
00:36:18,728 --> 00:36:21,318
I want everybody to write down
exactly what they saw.

246
00:36:21,736 --> 00:36:23,199
I didn't see nothing, Marshal.

247
00:36:23,324 --> 00:36:25,120
Fine. Then you say that in writing.

248
00:36:25,204 --> 00:36:28,213
Nobody's gonna fault you, Marshal.
You give him every chance.

249
00:36:28,338 --> 00:36:29,758
Say it in writing.

250
00:36:30,218 --> 00:36:32,432
Marshal, I can't write.

251
00:36:33,727 --> 00:36:37,571
The sheriff here will write it down,
then you can put your mark on it.

252
00:36:38,031 --> 00:36:41,165
There's a saddle out there
that belongs to me. I'll be takin' that.

253
00:36:41,207 --> 00:36:44,633
Any of his friends or relatives show up,
want his horse or his belongings...

254
00:36:44,758 --> 00:36:45,761
...you let me know, huh?

255
00:36:45,844 --> 00:36:47,432
You can wire me at Fort Grant.

256
00:36:47,474 --> 00:36:49,563
You gonna pick up the Swede now?

257
00:36:51,067 --> 00:36:53,073
I'm going to have that steak now.

258
00:37:15,719 --> 00:37:19,019
Oh, Swede, that's the one
the marshal just brought in.

259
00:37:20,524 --> 00:37:21,527
Swede!

260
00:37:58,295 --> 00:37:59,590
What was that all about?

261
00:37:59,966 --> 00:38:01,721
That's Judge Fenton's orders.

262
00:38:01,763 --> 00:38:04,312
Nobody comes in or out
that lady don't look at.

263
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:07,780
Marshal, the judge wants to see you,
right away.

264
00:38:21,819 --> 00:38:24,827
Good work, Cooper. See?

265
00:38:26,749 --> 00:38:29,214
The good Lord takes care
of those that do His work.

266
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:31,554
He just waltzed in,
and gave himself up.

267
00:38:35,356 --> 00:38:37,362
I never wanted to hang you, mister.

268
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:39,952
I asked them to give you a chance.

269
00:38:40,663 --> 00:38:42,251
Maybe you remember that.

270
00:38:43,379 --> 00:38:44,381
I remember that.

271
00:38:45,969 --> 00:38:48,685
I was here in Fort Grant
looking for a grubstake...

272
00:38:48,852 --> 00:38:52,612
...when I heard a marshal
with a hanging scar had killed Reno.

273
00:38:53,197 --> 00:38:56,665
I knew then we'd...
we'd hung an innocent man...

274
00:38:57,668 --> 00:38:59,674
...so I turned myself in.

275
00:39:00,008 --> 00:39:00,676
The others?

276
00:39:00,718 --> 00:39:03,894
He gave me their names. I've made out
the warrants for their arrests.

277
00:39:04,019 --> 00:39:05,607
- Where?
- Red Creek.

278
00:39:06,693 --> 00:39:09,618
Good. I'll be on my way.

279
00:39:11,039 --> 00:39:14,631
All right. You do it your way.
You round 'em up and bring 'em back.

280
00:39:14,715 --> 00:39:16,846
I don't know why you had to kill Reno.

281
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:18,852
It's in my report.

282
00:39:19,019 --> 00:39:20,941
I wanted him alive.
I needed these names.

283
00:39:21,025 --> 00:39:22,111
You got your names.

284
00:39:23,030 --> 00:39:26,749
Mister, you make sure the rest
of those men get back here alive.

285
00:39:32,681 --> 00:39:34,687
Jenkins, sit down, please.

286
00:40:23,448 --> 00:40:24,451
You're under arrest.

287
00:40:24,617 --> 00:40:25,746
Move!

288
00:41:37,361 --> 00:41:39,784
I have seven warrants here.

289
00:41:40,870 --> 00:41:43,712
Matt Stone, Loomis, Maddow...

290
00:41:44,881 --> 00:41:46,720
...Charley Blackfoot, Captain...

291
00:41:47,179 --> 00:41:49,770
...Captain Wilson!
Say, what the hell is this all about?

292
00:41:49,895 --> 00:41:51,190
A lynching.

293
00:41:53,321 --> 00:41:57,332
Now, I understand four of these men
I'm after are out at the Big W.

294
00:41:57,584 --> 00:41:59,505
Maddow and Miller, I'm not sure about.

295
00:41:59,715 --> 00:42:03,141
Maddow, he owns a spread around here.
And Miller...

296
00:42:04,603 --> 00:42:06,232
...Miller's a drifter.

297
00:42:07,235 --> 00:42:10,536
These men you're looking for,
they're all leading citizens.

298
00:42:10,578 --> 00:42:11,539
They're friends of mine.

299
00:42:11,623 --> 00:42:15,425
These friends of yours are wanted
for conspiracy to commit murder.

300
00:42:18,768 --> 00:42:21,024
If you'll put this man in jail, Sheriff...

301
00:42:21,149 --> 00:42:23,572
...you and I can ride out to the Big W.

302
00:42:53,823 --> 00:42:56,706
Sheriff! Sheriff Calhoun!

303
00:43:14,338 --> 00:43:16,260
Rustlers, they took our herd.

304
00:43:16,678 --> 00:43:19,059
They killed my pa and Danny.
Killed both of 'em!

305
00:43:19,728 --> 00:43:21,650
I rode in and found 'em there.

306
00:43:22,569 --> 00:43:24,157
Pa and Danny bushwhacked!

307
00:43:24,742 --> 00:43:26,371
And the herd gone.

308
00:43:27,081 --> 00:43:31,177
I won't be much good to you from here
on out. My back is giving me trouble.

309
00:43:31,385 --> 00:43:32,890
You're in good hands, however.

310
00:43:32,973 --> 00:43:34,895
This man here, is a federal marshal.

311
00:43:35,188 --> 00:43:37,360
Don't give me that bad back stuff.

312
00:43:37,778 --> 00:43:40,493
You've got your job,
I've got mine out at the Big W.

313
00:43:40,578 --> 00:43:42,708
His father and his brother
were murdered.

314
00:43:42,791 --> 00:43:44,296
You a lawman or ain't you?

315
00:44:37,903 --> 00:44:40,828
Not more than five, six hours ahead.

316
00:44:46,092 --> 00:44:48,432
Now they must slow down.

317
00:44:49,226 --> 00:44:50,521
Well, we won't.

318
00:45:39,699 --> 00:45:41,579
On your feet! Get up!

319
00:45:51,147 --> 00:45:53,404
The cattle won't live another day
without water.

320
00:45:53,445 --> 00:45:56,956
Mick, Willy, get 'em home.
Rafe, go with 'em!

321
00:46:03,223 --> 00:46:05,019
You've got one minute to pray.

322
00:46:05,145 --> 00:46:06,148
There'll be no hangin' here.

323
00:46:06,441 --> 00:46:09,657
They killed my father and brother.
They're gonna get what's comin' to 'em.

324
00:46:09,783 --> 00:46:11,663
They'll get what the law says
is comin' to 'em.

325
00:46:11,788 --> 00:46:14,254
If you can't stomach hanging,
why don't you ride out?

326
00:46:14,379 --> 00:46:15,841
We'll do what needs doin' here.

327
00:46:15,967 --> 00:46:18,265
I'll say it one more time.

328
00:46:18,390 --> 00:46:20,061
There's gonna be no hanging!

329
00:46:20,771 --> 00:46:23,194
We're not turning three murderers loose!

330
00:46:23,487 --> 00:46:25,994
That's right. You're turning them
over to me, the law.

331
00:46:26,078 --> 00:46:27,875
I'll make sure they get to Fort Grant.

332
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,423
Fort Grant's better than
a three day's ride from here.

333
00:46:30,458 --> 00:46:31,886
You'll never make it alone.

334
00:46:32,304 --> 00:46:34,477
I didn't plan on makin' it alone.

335
00:46:36,105 --> 00:46:38,488
You men got a $10 posse fee comin'.

336
00:46:39,031 --> 00:46:41,412
I can't guarantee
the government's gonna pay any more.

337
00:46:41,496 --> 00:46:44,212
Every man who sticks with me
will get an extra $10...

338
00:46:44,253 --> 00:46:45,925
...if I have to pay for it myself.

339
00:46:47,513 --> 00:46:49,309
I'll take my $10 now!

340
00:46:49,517 --> 00:46:51,315
I've got your name. They'll send it to you.

341
00:46:51,357 --> 00:46:53,863
We'll put in for the money
ourselves, Marshal.

342
00:46:59,253 --> 00:47:02,763
The men these rustlers killed,
they were my friends.

343
00:47:03,139 --> 00:47:05,479
These three, they are for hanging!

344
00:47:10,535 --> 00:47:11,746
Leave us, Marshal...

345
00:47:12,666 --> 00:47:14,462
...for just ten minutes.

346
00:47:17,095 --> 00:47:18,473
Five minutes!

347
00:47:49,559 --> 00:47:51,147
On your feet!

348
00:47:51,941 --> 00:47:53,028
Thank you, Marshal.

349
00:47:53,821 --> 00:47:56,746
I just want you to know,
we had nothing to do with the killing.

350
00:47:56,829 --> 00:47:57,624
Shut up.

351
00:47:57,749 --> 00:48:00,172
We rustled the herd all right.
But me and Ben, we...

352
00:48:00,213 --> 00:48:02,053
Didn't I tell you to shut your mouth?!

353
00:48:02,178 --> 00:48:04,642
My brother's telling the truth.
He done it!

354
00:48:06,064 --> 00:48:07,860
All right, Marshal! All right.

355
00:48:32,805 --> 00:48:35,896
All right, saddle up those horses
and nothing foolish.

356
00:48:44,712 --> 00:48:47,428
You're very kind, Marshal.
Would you be my friend, too?

357
00:48:47,512 --> 00:48:49,267
Forget about it!

358
00:48:52,651 --> 00:48:56,870
Say, I seen you when you drug
that ol' Stone into jail.

359
00:48:57,665 --> 00:49:01,969
I thought that was really something.
I just about died right then and there.

360
00:49:03,139 --> 00:49:06,983
I picked up my two amigos here,
and rustled this fat herd...

361
00:49:07,275 --> 00:49:10,283
...and headed lickety-split
for south of the border.

362
00:49:12,581 --> 00:49:14,712
You know something?

363
00:49:16,593 --> 00:49:19,183
Mister... Deputy Marshal...

364
00:49:20,311 --> 00:49:24,197
You know when I woked up, and seen
that gun pointing right at my mouth...

365
00:49:24,991 --> 00:49:27,581
...and you standing at
the other end of it...

366
00:49:27,999 --> 00:49:32,428
...I said to myself, "Miller, you move
one inch and you're a dead man.

367
00:49:32,511 --> 00:49:35,729
"This man's about to blow your head off."

368
00:49:36,356 --> 00:49:39,030
I mean, what them boys said was right.

369
00:49:39,615 --> 00:49:40,951
We guilty as hell.

370
00:49:45,422 --> 00:49:48,138
You know, when we get to Fort Grant...

371
00:49:49,058 --> 00:49:50,771
...all they gonna do is hang us.

372
00:49:52,776 --> 00:49:54,572
I tell you what...

373
00:49:55,367 --> 00:49:59,837
Why don't you be real smart,
and use your head, you know...

374
00:50:01,258 --> 00:50:03,180
And let us go.

375
00:50:04,183 --> 00:50:05,395
Just let us go.

376
00:50:05,478 --> 00:50:06,606
We outnumber you three to one.

377
00:50:06,648 --> 00:50:08,653
You can tell 'em that we jumped you.

378
00:50:08,987 --> 00:50:12,998
And the boys and I, you know, we ain't
gonna be around to call you a liar.

379
00:50:13,876 --> 00:50:15,296
Get aboard, Miller.

380
00:50:17,887 --> 00:50:20,895
I can't get aboard
'cause my hands are tied.

381
00:50:22,023 --> 00:50:24,280
You gonna have to help me.

382
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:31,300
I said get aboard!

383
00:50:31,633 --> 00:50:35,018
You are never gonna get me alive
to Fort Grant, boy.

384
00:50:35,311 --> 00:50:38,653
Then I'll get you there dead! Boy!

385
00:51:53,277 --> 00:51:55,784
Get down. The horses need rest.

386
00:52:23,026 --> 00:52:24,530
Start walking.

387
00:54:17,092 --> 00:54:18,638
Get aboard, Miller.

388
00:55:41,451 --> 00:55:42,371
Kill me!

389
00:55:46,465 --> 00:55:47,468
Kill me!

390
00:55:52,398 --> 00:55:53,610
Kill...

391
00:56:25,156 --> 00:56:27,662
Please, please.

392
00:56:27,872 --> 00:56:29,543
I didn't set out to touch her.

393
00:56:29,668 --> 00:56:32,468
I was drunk, full of rotgut whiskey.

394
00:56:32,676 --> 00:56:34,557
I didn't know what I was doing.

395
00:56:34,974 --> 00:56:36,353
Please, my family.

396
00:56:36,395 --> 00:56:37,941
Take him away.

397
00:56:38,358 --> 00:56:40,489
Please, my family.

398
00:56:41,074 --> 00:56:42,871
I didn't know what I was doing.

399
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:46,798
Samuel Dodd.

400
00:56:46,966 --> 00:56:48,888
Charge: whiskey peddling.

401
00:56:50,894 --> 00:56:52,523
Here, Your Honor.

402
00:57:02,217 --> 00:57:05,225
Court's adjourned.
Eight o'clock tomorrow morning.

403
00:57:05,518 --> 00:57:08,400
All rise until His Honor has
left the courtroom.

404
00:57:41,659 --> 00:57:45,085
The sheriff in Red Creek wired
you were bringing three killers in alone.

405
00:57:45,211 --> 00:57:49,096
That was over two days ago.
I near gave you up for dead.

406
00:57:49,222 --> 00:57:51,311
You're a damn fool, Cooper.

407
00:57:51,603 --> 00:57:54,611
A bloody damn fool, and the best there is.

408
00:57:54,821 --> 00:57:55,907
Hear that?

409
00:57:56,241 --> 00:57:59,040
Wake up, you godforsaken people, you!

410
00:57:59,292 --> 00:58:02,425
The best there is,
this man here that works for you!

411
00:58:02,467 --> 00:58:04,096
For your government. Our country!

412
00:58:04,221 --> 00:58:07,439
The best country on the earth,
because of men like Marshal Jed Cooper!

413
00:58:07,522 --> 00:58:08,525
I'm proud of you!

414
00:58:08,650 --> 00:58:12,035
They'll hear about this, not just
in the territories, but in Washington.

415
00:58:12,076 --> 00:58:13,874
Across the length and breadth
of this nation...

416
00:58:13,916 --> 00:58:15,921
...they're gonna know
that name, Jed Cooper!

417
00:58:16,047 --> 00:58:18,553
Now, what have you got
to say about that, boy?!

418
00:59:56,366 --> 00:59:58,580
Anything else I can do for you, Marshal?

419
01:00:08,776 --> 01:00:12,577
Good Lord, you bring back half of these,
you'll have a wagonload.

420
01:00:12,912 --> 01:00:15,920
Well, you know me, Judge.
I like a lot of company.

421
01:00:16,338 --> 01:00:17,926
How long you figure to take?

422
01:00:18,218 --> 01:00:21,394
Six, seven weeks, give or take a month.

423
01:00:21,728 --> 01:00:23,232
Come in.

424
01:00:24,820 --> 01:00:26,199
Well, well, well.

425
01:00:27,954 --> 01:00:30,962
The prodigal returneth
from a fate worse than death.

426
01:00:31,129 --> 01:00:32,132
Was that your idea?

427
01:00:32,215 --> 01:00:33,428
You fell right in my arms...

428
01:00:33,553 --> 01:00:35,558
...and since The Row happened to be
the closest haven...

429
01:00:35,641 --> 01:00:38,357
...and since you didn't appear to need
the doctor's services...

430
01:00:38,441 --> 01:00:40,572
Well, I'll be on my way.

431
01:00:41,449 --> 01:00:42,578
See you, Jed.

432
01:00:44,039 --> 01:00:46,589
Aside from the girl
who served me breakfast...

433
01:00:46,672 --> 01:00:49,179
...I didn't see anybody else,
that I remember.

434
01:00:49,638 --> 01:00:50,851
Do I owe them a bill?

435
01:00:50,976 --> 01:00:53,650
Of course. Just put it
on your expense account.

436
01:00:54,067 --> 01:00:55,405
Under what?

437
01:00:56,198 --> 01:01:00,419
You're going to make me
one hell of a lawman, you are, Jed.

438
01:01:00,878 --> 01:01:02,215
Judge...

439
01:01:02,800 --> 01:01:04,680
...about those three I brought in...

440
01:01:04,805 --> 01:01:06,018
All taken care of.

441
01:01:06,226 --> 01:01:09,402
I don't think they spent
as pleasant an evening as you did.

442
01:01:10,112 --> 01:01:13,120
I wanted to talk to you
about the two boys, Ben and Billy-Joe.

443
01:01:13,155 --> 01:01:16,045
Later, later.
Write it down, when you've got time.

444
01:01:16,087 --> 01:01:18,427
I just wanted to say,
as long as I'm here...

445
01:01:18,636 --> 01:01:21,101
...that only Miller is to be charged
with murder.

446
01:01:21,644 --> 01:01:24,903
If it wasn't for those two boys,
I might not have made it.

447
01:01:25,029 --> 01:01:26,324
Miller tried to kill me.

448
01:01:26,366 --> 01:01:28,914
If one or both of them
had pitched in and given him a hand...

449
01:01:29,040 --> 01:01:31,338
Did they pitch in to help you
subdue Miller?

450
01:01:31,839 --> 01:01:33,844
- Oh, no.
- Write it in your report.

451
01:01:34,346 --> 01:01:37,647
Hey, Marshal, if you catch
a whiskey peddler...

452
01:01:37,730 --> 01:01:40,655
...let him go and bring
the whiskey back this time!

453
01:01:42,368 --> 01:01:45,752
Hey, Ace, mind if I call
on that señorita of yours?

454
01:01:46,087 --> 01:01:50,307
I hear they got some wicked women
in Los Gatos. Snatch us a few!

455
01:01:53,357 --> 01:01:55,780
So long, Ace. Good hunting!

456
01:01:56,574 --> 01:01:58,121
Bliss is dead.

457
01:02:00,292 --> 01:02:02,298
Bliss? What happened?

458
01:02:04,095 --> 01:02:07,731
He went to pick up one of the Walker boys
at the Elmwood jail.

459
01:02:08,189 --> 01:02:11,323
The Walker clan, all seven of them,
were waiting.

460
01:02:12,326 --> 01:02:15,334
They shot him down, right there
in the middle of the main street.

461
01:02:15,418 --> 01:02:18,427
Not a soul in Elmwood
lifted a hand to help him.

462
01:02:21,811 --> 01:02:23,566
I owed my life to Bliss.

463
01:02:23,733 --> 01:02:27,242
He was a man with a backbone,
a lawman...

464
01:02:28,622 --> 01:02:31,379
Won't be easy to fill his shoes.

465
01:02:32,549 --> 01:02:33,969
No, it won't.

466
01:02:37,981 --> 01:02:40,989
Well, I'd better get on back to Red Creek.

467
01:02:43,245 --> 01:02:45,251
When the local sheriff wired you...

468
01:02:45,376 --> 01:02:49,011
...I don't suppose he told you I arrested
one of the men who tried to lynch me.

469
01:02:49,053 --> 01:02:51,602
I was goin' after the rest of them,
when this business came up.

470
01:02:51,685 --> 01:02:52,897
The man you arrested?

471
01:02:52,932 --> 01:02:54,693
Name's Stone.
He's in the Red Creek jail.

472
01:02:54,819 --> 01:02:57,619
Good. That ought to hold him
till you're finished here.

473
01:02:57,702 --> 01:02:59,707
- Finished here?
- Testifying.

474
01:03:00,209 --> 01:03:01,505
Testifying? When?

475
01:03:01,630 --> 01:03:05,098
I've got a backlog of cases built up
from here to Sunday.

476
01:03:05,306 --> 01:03:08,440
I happen to have a prisoner
over there in that cardboard jail.

477
01:03:08,607 --> 01:03:10,613
The sheriff who's guarding him
has got a bad back.

478
01:03:10,655 --> 01:03:13,914
- And if I don't get back over there...
- You'll get back, Cooper.

479
01:03:14,499 --> 01:03:17,507
You'll get back when I tell you
you're free to go.

480
01:03:20,850 --> 01:03:22,271
Cooper!

481
01:03:23,649 --> 01:03:27,660
You can be the best I've ever had.
The best there is, if you remember this:

482
01:03:27,743 --> 01:03:31,337
You work for the government.
You work for justice!

483
01:03:37,563 --> 01:03:40,487
Excuse me, Judge.
I heard there were three new prisoners.

484
01:03:43,495 --> 01:03:46,713
Marshal, why don't you take Miss Warren
down to the cellblock?

485
01:04:18,843 --> 01:04:20,849
Two of them are just boys.

486
01:04:21,226 --> 01:04:23,356
Old enough to rustle cattle.

487
01:04:23,774 --> 01:04:25,362
You want them to hang?

488
01:04:25,655 --> 01:04:29,582
I just want them to get a fair trial.
Who do you want to hang?

489
01:04:35,682 --> 01:04:37,646
We all have our ghosts, Marshal.

490
01:04:38,481 --> 01:04:40,487
You hunt your way...

491
01:04:40,863 --> 01:04:42,493
...I hunt mine.

492
01:04:59,707 --> 01:05:02,298
All right. You claim
you didn't pull the trigger.

493
01:05:03,426 --> 01:05:05,640
Let's forget about the killings.

494
01:05:06,434 --> 01:05:10,738
Rustling is a hanging offense
and they are all guilty!

495
01:05:11,030 --> 01:05:12,451
All three of them.

496
01:05:12,534 --> 01:05:15,459
No matter whose idea it was,
they're all guilty!

497
01:05:16,545 --> 01:05:17,673
That's the law!

498
01:05:17,708 --> 01:05:18,551
Object!

499
01:05:18,843 --> 01:05:20,055
Sustained.

500
01:05:20,724 --> 01:05:21,935
You, sir...

501
01:05:24,651 --> 01:05:27,158
You will elicit facts from the witness.

502
01:05:27,367 --> 01:05:29,665
I will tell the jury what's the law.

503
01:05:29,874 --> 01:05:32,673
Yes, sir.
No further questions, Your Honor.

504
01:05:32,966 --> 01:05:37,353
The jury will disregard all the
prosecution's remarks concerning the law.

505
01:05:40,570 --> 01:05:41,991
All right, son...

506
01:05:43,119 --> 01:05:44,498
...you may step down.

507
01:05:49,512 --> 01:05:51,099
Call your next witness.

508
01:05:51,308 --> 01:05:53,523
Marshal Jedediah Cooper.

509
01:06:01,629 --> 01:06:03,717
Do you solemnly swear
to tell the whole truth...

510
01:06:03,802 --> 01:06:06,016
...and nothing but the truth,
so help you God?

511
01:06:06,141 --> 01:06:08,564
Marshal, at the time
of their apprehension...

512
01:06:08,606 --> 01:06:12,032
...did any of these three defendants
deny their guilt?

513
01:06:12,367 --> 01:06:14,247
No, but on the trail back here...

514
01:06:14,456 --> 01:06:17,381
We are not interested
in the trip back to Fort Grant.

515
01:06:17,416 --> 01:06:21,768
It was a heroic journey. The whole court,
the whole territory is grateful.

516
01:06:21,852 --> 01:06:23,565
I think something that happened...

517
01:06:23,648 --> 01:06:26,071
...on the trail back here
has a bearing on the case.

518
01:06:26,197 --> 01:06:27,994
Did something happen
that leads you to believe...

519
01:06:28,077 --> 01:06:30,793
...that one, or all three
of these defendants are innocent?

520
01:06:30,835 --> 01:06:34,177
Of murder, yes. You see,
both Ben and Billy-Joe told me...

521
01:06:34,261 --> 01:06:38,397
Marshal, this court is not concerned
with hearsay evidence.

522
01:06:38,690 --> 01:06:40,988
This court requires facts.

523
01:06:41,280 --> 01:06:45,292
The defendants, all three, are charged
with murder and rustling. Facts!

524
01:06:45,500 --> 01:06:47,631
The only matter that concerns this court!

525
01:06:47,666 --> 01:06:50,096
I thought this court
was concerned with justice!

526
01:06:50,221 --> 01:06:52,436
Justice is my province, Marshal.

527
01:06:52,687 --> 01:06:54,525
Mine, and mine alone.

528
01:06:55,445 --> 01:06:58,829
You'll confine yourself to giving
direct answers to direct questions...

529
01:06:58,913 --> 01:07:00,918
...or find yourself in contempt of court.
Proceed.

530
01:07:00,960 --> 01:07:03,425
One of those boys is 18,
the other's only 16...

531
01:07:03,467 --> 01:07:04,135
That'll cost you $10.

532
01:07:04,260 --> 01:07:06,058
They've never been
in trouble with the law...

533
01:07:06,099 --> 01:07:07,645
- $20!
- If it wasn't for them, I wouldn't...

534
01:07:07,687 --> 01:07:12,074
$30! One more word
and you'll spend 30 days in the hole!

535
01:07:13,160 --> 01:07:16,252
Do you have any further questions
for this witness?

536
01:07:16,544 --> 01:07:18,968
No more questions, Your Honor.

537
01:07:21,266 --> 01:07:24,483
Then you may step down, Marshal.

538
01:08:10,152 --> 01:08:11,656
Sheriff Ray Calhoun.

539
01:08:12,032 --> 01:08:13,578
Red Creek.

540
01:08:13,954 --> 01:08:15,584
I recognize you.

541
01:08:19,845 --> 01:08:23,647
I want to congratulate you on the job
you did bringing in those rustlers.

542
01:08:24,775 --> 01:08:27,282
You mean you rode all the way over here
from Red Creek...

543
01:08:27,408 --> 01:08:29,497
...bad back and all, just to tell me that?

544
01:08:30,792 --> 01:08:31,794
No.

545
01:08:32,672 --> 01:08:33,884
Stone's dead.

546
01:08:36,308 --> 01:08:37,811
What happened, Calhoun?

547
01:08:40,026 --> 01:08:43,285
It didn't make no sense,
him sittin' in that cell going crazy...

548
01:08:44,037 --> 01:08:45,834
...the town without no blacksmith.

549
01:08:50,096 --> 01:08:53,313
He promised that if I turned him loose
every day for a couple of hours...

550
01:08:53,438 --> 01:08:57,826
...to work at his trade, that he'd come
back to his cell each night. And, he did.

551
01:08:57,909 --> 01:09:00,249
He came back every night but one.

552
01:09:00,834 --> 01:09:04,469
I rode out to his home,
a home where I had many a dinner.

553
01:09:05,137 --> 01:09:06,934
The home of a friend.

554
01:09:07,560 --> 01:09:10,945
I had to bring him back and put him
in his cell at gunpoint.

555
01:09:11,864 --> 01:09:13,494
He made a break for it.

556
01:09:13,744 --> 01:09:16,460
I tried to shoot low,
but I'm not very good at that.

557
01:09:22,561 --> 01:09:25,569
I heard you paid $800 to the skunk
who murdered the Johansons...

558
01:09:25,695 --> 01:09:27,157
...and sold you their herd.

559
01:09:29,288 --> 01:09:30,709
That's right.

560
01:09:31,001 --> 01:09:34,009
How much did you get back
when they were caught?

561
01:09:35,178 --> 01:09:36,976
$11 and 40 cents.

562
01:09:40,987 --> 01:09:44,120
There's $800 in this
envelope. It's yours...

563
01:09:44,748 --> 01:09:48,006
...or you can keep the 100 head,
prime, every one of 'em.

564
01:09:49,427 --> 01:09:53,563
Don't have much use for cattle
these days. Here's $10.

565
01:09:54,566 --> 01:09:55,819
Keep it.

566
01:10:03,257 --> 01:10:05,179
$11...

567
01:10:07,435 --> 01:10:08,856
...and 40 cents...

568
01:10:08,981 --> 01:10:11,070
...for the aggravation they caused me.

569
01:10:11,571 --> 01:10:13,869
Now, you take that bad back of yours...

570
01:10:13,912 --> 01:10:18,256
...right over to Red Creek and tell
your friends we're even, money-wise.

571
01:10:34,636 --> 01:10:36,098
It's no deal.

572
01:10:37,686 --> 01:10:40,025
He figures you still owe him
for a lynching.

573
01:10:40,318 --> 01:10:43,243
I told you, you never should have
offered him the money.

574
01:10:43,703 --> 01:10:47,714
All right, now that makes
three mistakes we made:

575
01:10:48,717 --> 01:10:52,059
The money, we hung an innocent man...

576
01:10:53,061 --> 01:10:55,317
...and we didn't finish the job.

577
01:10:56,864 --> 01:10:59,078
We can't undo the first two...

578
01:11:00,541 --> 01:11:02,672
...but we can still finish the job.

579
01:11:09,482 --> 01:11:11,487
I didn't hear that, Captain Wilson.

580
01:11:11,864 --> 01:11:13,284
I didn't hear none of it.

581
01:11:18,507 --> 01:11:19,969
I'm riding back to Red Creek.

582
01:11:20,387 --> 01:11:22,393
Are you coming with me?

583
01:11:28,494 --> 01:11:31,585
Charley, you've been with me
better than five years.

584
01:11:33,591 --> 01:11:35,136
Good years, Captain.

585
01:11:35,596 --> 01:11:39,607
Maybe if it was my land
I was fighting to hold. No, Captain.

586
01:11:40,526 --> 01:11:44,329
If that marshal wants Charley Blackfoot,
he's gonna have to find him.

587
01:11:49,844 --> 01:11:51,223
Sorry, Captain Wilson.

588
01:11:51,557 --> 01:11:55,443
Maddow, you're damn near my age.
You wouldn't last six months in that jail.

589
01:11:55,777 --> 01:11:58,786
I don't intend to try to.
I can still ride pretty good.

590
01:11:58,828 --> 01:12:00,582
You can shoot even better.

591
01:12:00,749 --> 01:12:02,254
Sorry, Captain.

592
01:12:02,462 --> 01:12:05,178
Maddow, he'll come after you.
He'll keep comin'.

593
01:12:05,262 --> 01:12:06,598
You'll be nothin' but an animal.

594
01:12:06,683 --> 01:12:08,646
An animal running scared.

595
01:12:10,276 --> 01:12:11,571
Sorry, Captain.

596
01:12:23,896 --> 01:12:25,694
How about you two? You sure?

597
01:12:27,114 --> 01:12:28,117
Tommy?

598
01:12:30,038 --> 01:12:31,710
It was wrong to hang that man.

599
01:12:32,044 --> 01:12:33,506
We all know it now.

600
01:12:34,927 --> 01:12:37,225
I was hoping we could square it with him.

601
01:12:37,643 --> 01:12:40,651
My wife, she was kind of hopin' it, too.

602
01:12:42,824 --> 01:12:43,827
Loomis?

603
01:12:46,334 --> 01:12:48,465
I'm 37, 38, I...

604
01:12:49,259 --> 01:12:51,474
...don't rightly know for sure.

605
01:12:52,059 --> 01:12:54,565
I started drifting when I was just a kid.

606
01:12:55,735 --> 01:12:58,075
These last few years, working for you...

607
01:13:02,378 --> 01:13:04,300
It was the first home I ever knew.

608
01:13:06,097 --> 01:13:09,356
Saved a few dollars,
thinking of findin' myself a woman...

609
01:13:10,359 --> 01:13:14,119
...staking off a few acres of my own,
when this come up.

610
01:13:14,579 --> 01:13:16,584
You mean, when I brought it up.

611
01:13:17,504 --> 01:13:19,593
You didn't force me
to ride with you, Captain.

612
01:13:21,515 --> 01:13:24,607
We thought we was doing the right thing.
We was.

613
01:13:25,609 --> 01:13:27,907
Hanging the wrong man
don't change that.

614
01:13:27,991 --> 01:13:29,746
Five years, even ten...

615
01:13:30,999 --> 01:13:34,425
You two can survive it and still come out
to live some kind of life.

616
01:13:34,551 --> 01:13:36,139
What kind, Captain?

617
01:13:36,557 --> 01:13:40,233
I been a free man.
That's the only kind of life I know.

618
01:13:40,734 --> 01:13:43,242
My wife, Thelma, she's a young woman.

619
01:13:43,827 --> 01:13:46,166
She wants kids, a family.

620
01:13:47,044 --> 01:13:49,384
Even if I asked her to wait for me...

621
01:13:49,634 --> 01:13:51,849
...even if she said she would...

622
01:13:52,559 --> 01:13:54,188
...I couldn't be sure.

623
01:14:00,080 --> 01:14:01,459
Let's ride, gentlemen.

624
01:14:21,807 --> 01:14:23,520
Hey, mister, where's the hotel?

625
01:14:23,646 --> 01:14:26,027
Down the street, but keep goin',
it's full up.

626
01:14:26,235 --> 01:14:28,325
The whole town's full up for this hanging.

627
01:14:28,534 --> 01:14:30,832
I hear they got tents set up,
off the boondocks.

628
01:14:31,124 --> 01:14:32,629
Thank you kindly.

629
01:14:54,481 --> 01:14:56,152
- Who is it?
- Open up.

630
01:15:04,509 --> 01:15:06,597
I came here to tell you
about the biggest thing...

631
01:15:06,682 --> 01:15:09,773
...that happened in this territory.
Bigger than statehood.

632
01:15:09,982 --> 01:15:12,991
People showin' up by the wagonful,
men, women, and children...

633
01:15:13,116 --> 01:15:16,124
...all just to see your lousy hanging.
- That's enough.

634
01:15:16,500 --> 01:15:19,801
- To see your circus, a six-man hanging.
- I said that's enough!

635
01:15:20,219 --> 01:15:21,389
You stink of whiskey.

636
01:15:21,514 --> 01:15:23,937
Just go back to your room.
Lie down, and sleep it off!

637
01:15:24,022 --> 01:15:25,735
You're lynching those boys, why?

638
01:15:26,821 --> 01:15:28,158
Why?

639
01:15:32,962 --> 01:15:34,425
Because of you, Cooper.

640
01:15:37,224 --> 01:15:41,152
Because of that beautiful,
that magnificent journey you took...

641
01:15:41,235 --> 01:15:43,366
...to bring three killers to justice.

642
01:15:44,244 --> 01:15:47,461
If the law didn't hang them,
the next posse that goes out would say...

643
01:15:47,502 --> 01:15:50,386
..."Hang 'em, and hang 'em high!
There's no justice in Fort Grant."

644
01:15:50,470 --> 01:15:52,058
And if there's no justice in Fort Grant...

645
01:15:52,099 --> 01:15:54,063
...there'll be no statehood
for this territory.

646
01:15:54,188 --> 01:15:56,194
I don't care how you slice it.

647
01:15:56,570 --> 01:15:58,993
Whether it's nine men out on a plain
with a dirty rope...

648
01:15:59,077 --> 01:16:02,586
...or a judge with his robes on
in front of the American flag...

649
01:16:02,669 --> 01:16:05,887
...those boys are gonna be just as dead
as if they'd been lynched!

650
01:16:06,890 --> 01:16:10,483
That's right, Cooper, just as dead,
but they won't have been lynched.

651
01:16:10,609 --> 01:16:13,115
They'll have been judged.
If you can't see the difference...

652
01:16:13,150 --> 01:16:16,040
...you'd better take off that star,
and right now!

653
01:16:18,296 --> 01:16:20,845
Not just yet, Your Honor.

654
01:16:22,935 --> 01:16:28,659
Yes, we'll gather at the river.

655
01:16:29,829 --> 01:16:34,718
The beautiful river.

656
01:16:37,349 --> 01:16:42,155
Gather with the saints at the river.

657
01:16:43,742 --> 01:16:49,090
That flows by the throne of God.

658
01:17:01,166 --> 01:17:04,090
Cold beer and sarsparilla
for the kiddies...

659
01:17:04,174 --> 01:17:06,723
...pretzels, candy bars, cold beer.

660
01:17:12,990 --> 01:17:16,792
Last chance. The drapes can wait.
Sure you won't change your mind?

661
01:17:16,834 --> 01:17:21,012
Sophie, I told you before,
there's only one hanging I'm interested in.

662
01:17:47,085 --> 01:17:48,003
Let me go!

663
01:17:48,087 --> 01:17:50,260
No! I said no!

664
01:19:17,752 --> 01:19:21,638
Get your cold beer, sarsaparilla.

665
01:19:37,975 --> 01:19:40,064
Hey, what are you doing?

666
01:19:40,649 --> 01:19:45,413
Can't you make it tomorrow?
I don't want to miss the hanging.

667
01:19:52,223 --> 01:19:55,398
"Confess thy iniquities and transgressions
unto the Lord...

668
01:19:55,440 --> 01:19:57,111
"...and he will forgive thee thy sins."

669
01:19:57,237 --> 01:19:59,911
- Now, Preacher?
- Patience.

670
01:20:03,211 --> 01:20:06,930
"Blessed is the man that walketh not
in the counsel of the ungodly...

671
01:20:07,307 --> 01:20:09,521
"...nor standeth in the way of sinners...

672
01:20:09,646 --> 01:20:12,028
"...nor sitteth in the
seat of the scornful.

673
01:20:12,864 --> 01:20:16,540
"But his delight is in
the law of the Lord...

674
01:20:17,835 --> 01:20:21,679
"...and in His law doth he meditate,
day and night.

675
01:20:23,142 --> 01:20:27,278
"And he shall be like a tree
planted by the rivers of water...

676
01:20:27,863 --> 01:20:30,956
"...that bringeth forth
his fruit in His season.

677
01:20:32,084 --> 01:20:34,382
"His leaf shall not wither...

678
01:20:34,674 --> 01:20:36,972
"...and whatever he doeth shall prosper."

679
01:20:37,974 --> 01:20:38,769
Amen.

680
01:20:42,487 --> 01:20:45,120
We will now sing "Rock of Ages."

681
01:20:45,496 --> 01:20:48,086
Get your cold beer and pretzels!

682
01:20:48,587 --> 01:20:50,927
Rock of ages

683
01:20:52,515 --> 01:20:55,106
Cleft for me

684
01:20:56,401 --> 01:21:02,794
Let me hide myself in thee

685
01:21:03,922 --> 01:21:07,640
Like the water

686
01:21:08,142 --> 01:21:10,607
And the blood

687
01:21:11,443 --> 01:21:13,949
From thy wounded...

688
01:22:27,863 --> 01:22:29,074
You have last requests?

689
01:22:30,955 --> 01:22:34,298
- Do you have last requests?
- I'd sure like me a chew of tobacco.

690
01:22:34,966 --> 01:22:37,765
What's the matter, hangman?
You afraid I'll choke and...

691
01:22:37,890 --> 01:22:39,896
...cheat you out of your hangin' fee?

692
01:22:52,932 --> 01:22:54,604
Put it in my pocket.

693
01:23:21,386 --> 01:23:22,388
Now, Preacher?

694
01:23:22,765 --> 01:23:25,063
You may say your piece now.

695
01:23:27,862 --> 01:23:30,996
You are now looking for the last time...

696
01:23:32,208 --> 01:23:35,384
...at the mortal body
of Francis Elroy Duffy...

697
01:23:35,885 --> 01:23:38,015
...born to John and Edna Duffy...

698
01:23:38,099 --> 01:23:39,102
You have last requests?

699
01:23:39,395 --> 01:23:41,818
...good God-fearing folks...

700
01:23:42,277 --> 01:23:46,122
...who raised me up to be
a good man and a good Christian.

701
01:23:46,707 --> 01:23:49,088
Bye, Ben. Bye.

702
01:23:50,091 --> 01:23:52,431
A good husband to my beloved wife.

703
01:23:53,099 --> 01:23:55,105
A good father to my children...

704
01:23:55,857 --> 01:23:57,026
...whom I leave behind...

705
01:23:57,863 --> 01:23:59,659
...hoping that they...

706
01:24:00,035 --> 01:24:02,667
...and all you, will learn...

707
01:24:03,127 --> 01:24:04,464
You have a last request?

708
01:24:04,548 --> 01:24:06,846
...this here lesson which I leave you with.

709
01:24:23,768 --> 01:24:26,274
When you take the devil
into your mouth...

710
01:24:27,110 --> 01:24:28,489
...you are doomed!

711
01:24:29,366 --> 01:24:32,166
For he is lying there in wait for you...

712
01:24:32,918 --> 01:24:35,007
...inside that bottle of whiskey...

713
01:24:35,717 --> 01:24:38,516
...waiting for you
to take him into your mouth.

714
01:24:38,809 --> 01:24:40,313
You have a last request?

715
01:24:42,612 --> 01:24:45,202
Tell him to shut up,
and let's get it over with.

716
01:24:48,126 --> 01:24:52,430
Liquor is the most foul and evil thing
in this here world.

717
01:24:53,642 --> 01:24:57,026
It has destroyed good men like myself.

718
01:24:59,742 --> 01:25:01,539
You have a last request?

719
01:25:28,698 --> 01:25:32,207
So take these words of advice,
and remember...

720
01:25:33,210 --> 01:25:38,015
...you heard them from a poor sinner,
who's got no more cause to lie...

721
01:25:39,311 --> 01:25:41,900
...'cause he's going to meet his Maker...

722
01:25:42,695 --> 01:25:44,240
...and now he's ready.

723
01:25:46,038 --> 01:25:47,624
That's all I've got to say.

724
01:25:56,734 --> 01:25:59,867
Will you all bow your heads
for one final prayer.

725
01:26:08,558 --> 01:26:11,566
May God have mercy
on their poor souls...

726
01:26:12,361 --> 01:26:13,781
...as He has...

727
01:26:13,864 --> 01:26:16,288
...upon all the faithful departed.

728
01:26:17,875 --> 01:26:18,586
Amen.

729
01:27:54,852 --> 01:27:56,357
Dear God!

730
01:28:03,544 --> 01:28:05,758
All right, all right, I'm coming.

731
01:28:08,306 --> 01:28:09,351
Judge Fenton...

732
01:28:09,686 --> 01:28:11,900
I come to praise, Sophie,
not to close you down.

733
01:28:11,984 --> 01:28:14,908
- I thought maybe you came to...
- Now, Sophie. Now...

734
01:28:14,992 --> 01:28:18,001
Well, now at least I know what it takes
to get you in here.

735
01:28:18,501 --> 01:28:20,006
How is he this morning?

736
01:28:20,299 --> 01:28:22,805
I've never seen a man
who has more right to be dead.

737
01:28:22,972 --> 01:28:24,978
I gotta see him, now.
Can't wait any longer.

738
01:28:25,103 --> 01:28:27,192
Check with Rachel. She's still in charge.

739
01:28:30,995 --> 01:28:32,541
She stayed all night?

740
01:28:32,749 --> 01:28:35,716
You heard Doc.
If Rachel hadn't stopped the bleeding...

741
01:28:35,799 --> 01:28:38,933
Somebody had to stay with him.
A couple of my girls volunteered.

742
01:28:38,975 --> 01:28:40,353
Rachel wouldn't have it.

743
01:28:40,563 --> 01:28:43,237
Same room, honeymoon suite,
at the head of the stairs.

744
01:28:43,279 --> 01:28:44,239
Thanks, Sophie.

745
01:28:44,449 --> 01:28:46,245
- Good morning, Judge.
- Good morning, dear.

746
01:28:46,370 --> 01:28:49,045
- Anything I can do for you?
- No, thank you, dear.

747
01:28:57,651 --> 01:29:00,451
It's all right, Judge.
I'm just about finishing up.

748
01:29:05,381 --> 01:29:08,264
I heard about what you did, Rachel.
I'm grateful.

749
01:29:08,682 --> 01:29:10,688
Why don't you sit down?

750
01:29:13,613 --> 01:29:14,699
Can I get you something?

751
01:29:14,824 --> 01:29:18,877
No, thank you. I shouldn't have done this.
I may never get up again.

752
01:29:30,451 --> 01:29:31,621
Who did it, Jed?

753
01:29:36,134 --> 01:29:40,270
Much as you want them, Jed,
I want them more. I need them.

754
01:29:44,532 --> 01:29:49,253
It's bad enough when a deputy gets
bushwhacked on some lonely trail, but...

755
01:29:50,131 --> 01:29:53,765
...here, in Fort Grant, in broad daylight!

756
01:29:55,478 --> 01:29:57,902
We can't let them get away with that.

757
01:29:58,696 --> 01:30:00,284
Now, who did it?

758
01:30:02,875 --> 01:30:05,298
I'll go after them myself.

759
01:30:06,969 --> 01:30:08,765
For the love of God, son!

760
01:30:08,974 --> 01:30:11,315
God's got nothing to do with it.

761
01:30:12,568 --> 01:30:14,323
I'll take care of them.

762
01:30:29,531 --> 01:30:31,036
Want me to take over?

763
01:30:31,328 --> 01:30:32,331
No.

764
01:30:34,044 --> 01:30:35,047
Thank you.

765
01:30:35,757 --> 01:30:37,638
You could use a good night's sleep.

766
01:30:41,774 --> 01:30:45,367
All right, honey. But one of these days
he's going to get better...

767
01:30:45,450 --> 01:30:47,791
...and you're gonna have
a man on your hands.

768
01:32:06,717 --> 01:32:08,097
You're perspiring.

769
01:32:11,523 --> 01:32:13,821
Don't drink your milk so fast.

770
01:32:24,935 --> 01:32:25,938
You look tired.

771
01:32:26,355 --> 01:32:28,026
Are you all right?

772
01:32:30,952 --> 01:32:32,957
You know you're a nag?

773
01:32:35,381 --> 01:32:36,843
A very pretty one, but a nag.

774
01:32:53,263 --> 01:32:54,601
What was that for?

775
01:32:54,976 --> 01:32:56,272
Just thanks.

776
01:32:58,612 --> 01:32:59,614
You're welcome.

777
01:33:03,792 --> 01:33:06,007
I'll get some salt for the eggs.

778
01:33:06,300 --> 01:33:07,428
Forget the salt.

779
01:33:11,522 --> 01:33:12,901
Please...

780
01:33:13,612 --> 01:33:14,907
Please don't.

781
01:33:16,328 --> 01:33:18,124
Well, I guess...

782
01:33:19,043 --> 01:33:21,508
...I guess my life isn't worth two kisses.

783
01:33:31,870 --> 01:33:33,333
Please...

784
01:33:34,879 --> 01:33:36,257
I'm sorry.

785
01:33:47,705 --> 01:33:49,711
What's the matter?

786
01:33:56,397 --> 01:33:58,903
I was married back in Denver.

787
01:34:01,118 --> 01:34:02,580
His name was Paul.

788
01:34:02,999 --> 01:34:05,798
He was a doctor, and a very fine man.

789
01:34:07,511 --> 01:34:10,017
He used to say this was his place...

790
01:34:11,146 --> 01:34:13,193
...this was where doctors were needed.

791
01:34:16,536 --> 01:34:19,335
One night, after we'd camped...

792
01:34:20,338 --> 01:34:22,636
...we sat around the fire talking...

793
01:34:23,221 --> 01:34:25,226
...husband and wife talk...

794
01:34:25,561 --> 01:34:28,945
...about how many children
we were going to have and...

795
01:34:30,240 --> 01:34:33,166
...what a wonderful life
we were going to have together.

796
01:34:38,472 --> 01:34:39,850
And then they came...

797
01:34:42,649 --> 01:34:44,655
...two men on horseback.

798
01:34:45,867 --> 01:34:47,455
Just some food...

799
01:34:49,084 --> 01:34:52,469
...just to share our food,
that's all they wanted.

800
01:34:54,808 --> 01:34:56,271
Then one of them...

801
01:34:58,486 --> 01:35:00,199
...put his hand on me...

802
01:35:03,500 --> 01:35:05,630
...and there was a shot...

803
01:35:07,093 --> 01:35:08,639
...and Paul was dead.

804
01:35:11,730 --> 01:35:15,533
And they just left him there
lying beside me on the ground, dead.

805
01:35:19,837 --> 01:35:22,343
And they took me...

806
01:35:25,561 --> 01:35:27,650
...and took me, and took me...

807
01:35:49,168 --> 01:35:50,922
The tumbleweed wagon...

808
01:35:52,009 --> 01:35:53,304
...the jail...

809
01:35:53,931 --> 01:35:55,811
...you're looking for those men?

810
01:36:02,330 --> 01:36:04,628
Well, what happens when you find them?

811
01:36:10,142 --> 01:36:12,023
Or if you don't find them?

812
01:36:17,454 --> 01:36:18,750
Ever?

813
01:36:29,070 --> 01:36:31,869
We'd better hurry. It's going to storm.

814
01:39:59,821 --> 01:40:02,620
Miss Rachel, where do you want
to put these blankets?

815
01:40:03,540 --> 01:40:06,046
- What is it, Marv?
- Where do you want these blankets?

816
01:40:06,171 --> 01:40:09,180
- Oh, just put them in the back someplace.
- Yes, ma'am.

817
01:40:19,459 --> 01:40:20,880
Hi, Marshal!

818
01:40:44,027 --> 01:40:47,453
You asked me once
whether I could ever stop looking.

819
01:40:47,488 --> 01:40:49,041
I think now I can.

820
01:40:49,834 --> 01:40:51,129
Can you?

821
01:40:52,049 --> 01:40:54,138
Well, Rachel, there's a difference.

822
01:40:54,848 --> 01:40:57,523
You see, I'm not...
I'm not looking for ghosts.

823
01:40:58,316 --> 01:41:00,656
The end of my trail's in Red Creek.

824
01:41:01,074 --> 01:41:02,453
Maybe not.

825
01:41:03,540 --> 01:41:04,668
What then?

826
01:41:06,673 --> 01:41:07,676
I don't know.

827
01:42:52,048 --> 01:42:53,343
I think we got him.

828
01:42:54,054 --> 01:42:55,349
I don't know.

829
01:42:56,059 --> 01:42:58,567
The dog or the shot, either one.

830
01:43:22,299 --> 01:43:24,095
Why ain't that dog yappin'?

831
01:43:25,391 --> 01:43:28,106
If that Marshal was alive,
that dog would be yappin', wouldn't it?

832
01:43:28,191 --> 01:43:29,987
I told you I didn't know.

833
01:43:34,207 --> 01:43:36,003
But I aim to find out.

834
01:43:40,015 --> 01:43:42,438
No! Let him come to us.

835
01:43:42,605 --> 01:43:45,948
No, Captain.
I've waited on him long enough.

836
01:43:52,841 --> 01:43:54,179
Why don't he move?

837
01:44:23,427 --> 01:44:24,680
Tommy.

838
01:45:27,396 --> 01:45:28,315
Drop it!

839
01:48:46,364 --> 01:48:47,784
Dead.

840
01:48:48,286 --> 01:48:49,790
Captain Wilson...

841
01:48:50,292 --> 01:48:52,171
...Tommy, Loomis...

842
01:48:53,759 --> 01:48:55,891
...all of them dead.

843
01:48:57,395 --> 01:48:59,525
All except Maddow, Blackfoot...

844
01:48:59,693 --> 01:49:01,698
...and you, Jenkins.

845
01:49:03,119 --> 01:49:05,124
Count me dead, too.

846
01:49:08,508 --> 01:49:11,809
I just want to say
that I don't hold you to blame...

847
01:49:12,937 --> 01:49:14,525
...for what that's worth.

848
01:49:16,322 --> 01:49:18,118
It's worth somethin'.

849
01:49:34,665 --> 01:49:36,671
So that's how it is, huh?

850
01:49:37,673 --> 01:49:41,183
That Rachel lit a fire in you
with that rich body of hers.

851
01:49:41,475 --> 01:49:44,651
You lit a fire in each other.
And now you're going to get married...

852
01:49:44,776 --> 01:49:48,285
...raise cattle and kids,
devil take the rest of the world.

853
01:49:48,410 --> 01:49:49,080
Maybe.

854
01:49:49,121 --> 01:49:52,464
Used the law and a badge
to heal the scar on your neck.

855
01:49:53,467 --> 01:49:56,392
How many men are you gonna
have to hang to heal your scars?

856
01:49:56,433 --> 01:49:57,478
Go to hell, Cooper!

857
01:49:57,520 --> 01:50:02,283
I've already been there, Judge, in your
wagon and in that hole you call a jail.

858
01:50:02,826 --> 01:50:04,622
And old man Jenkins is gonna die there.

859
01:50:04,707 --> 01:50:07,046
- Is he sick?
- He's dyin'.

860
01:50:07,296 --> 01:50:09,720
- I'll get a doctor down there for him.
- Let him go.

861
01:50:09,846 --> 01:50:12,102
He can go out and look
for another innocent man to lynch?

862
01:50:12,227 --> 01:50:13,732
He's an old man.

863
01:50:18,453 --> 01:50:21,127
That was an old rope
he helped put around your neck...

864
01:50:21,252 --> 01:50:23,926
...but it came damn near
to killing you, didn't it?

865
01:50:24,344 --> 01:50:26,141
What's the matter with you, Cooper?

866
01:50:27,144 --> 01:50:28,940
You got Jenkins on your conscience?

867
01:50:29,859 --> 01:50:31,740
Think I judged him too harshly?

868
01:50:31,865 --> 01:50:35,082
Used him like a piece of kindling
for my fire of justice?

869
01:50:35,667 --> 01:50:38,675
Maybe that's inevitable,
when there's only one man, one court...

870
01:50:38,717 --> 01:50:41,391
...with the power of final justice over a

871
01:50:41,426 --> 01:50:44,483
territory five times
the size of most states.

872
01:50:45,779 --> 01:50:49,790
Mistakes. Oh, I've made them, Cooper.
Don't you doubt it.

873
01:50:49,915 --> 01:50:52,004
Don't you doubt either,
there are times sittin' up there...

874
01:50:52,087 --> 01:50:54,803
...in that judgment seat,
I've wished, I have prayed...

875
01:50:55,095 --> 01:50:58,981
...that there was someone standing
between me and God Almighty!

876
01:50:59,817 --> 01:51:02,324
Someone with power to say,
"You're wrong, Fenton.

877
01:51:02,407 --> 01:51:06,335
"You've made a mistake in law,
and this man here deserves another trial...

878
01:51:06,419 --> 01:51:09,219
"...this man here a reprieve,
and this man is innocent!"

879
01:51:13,355 --> 01:51:15,946
But until this territory
becomes a state...

880
01:51:16,446 --> 01:51:19,622
...with a governor,
and a state court of appeals...

881
01:51:19,747 --> 01:51:22,840
...I'm the law here, all the law...

882
01:51:23,633 --> 01:51:27,435
...and if you don't like that,
you can cuss me till hell freezes over.

883
01:51:27,979 --> 01:51:29,985
Or you can join me, Cooper.

884
01:51:30,570 --> 01:51:32,241
Even fight me...

885
01:51:32,658 --> 01:51:35,583
...help me turn this godforsaken
territory into a state...

886
01:51:35,625 --> 01:51:38,007
...where no one man calls himself the law.

887
01:51:38,591 --> 01:51:40,597
I want that old man pardoned.

888
01:51:41,015 --> 01:51:42,477
You pick up your badge.

889
01:51:42,602 --> 01:51:44,399
Tonight, right now!

890
01:51:52,004 --> 01:51:56,223
Take this down, give it
to one of the guards down there.

891
01:51:56,683 --> 01:51:59,316
If there are any questions,
let him see me.

892
01:51:59,692 --> 01:52:01,697
There'll be no questions.

893
01:52:25,680 --> 01:52:27,059
Cooper.

894
01:52:27,352 --> 01:52:30,276
Charley Blackfoot was seen
in the town of Ridgeway.

895
01:52:30,694 --> 01:52:33,284
I got two unfilled warrants here...

896
01:52:33,577 --> 01:52:36,377
...Blackfoot and Maddow,
the law still wants them.
