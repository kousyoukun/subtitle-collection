1
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,300
I'm gonna have to carry you, huh?

2
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:02,400
There. There you go, boy.

3
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,100
Drop the gun belt, mister.

4
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:04,900
What's this all about?

5
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,600
The captain said to drop the gun belt!

6
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,300
Now!

7
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:25,100
They're wearin' the Johanson brand,
all right, Captain Wilson.

8
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,600
Whose else would they be?

9
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,400
Where did you get those cattle, mister?

10
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:29,800
Where that brand says.

11
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:32,200
- Got 'em from Johanson, eh?
- That's right.

12
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,300
And you've got a bill of sale to prove it.

13
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,400
Hold it!

14
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
That's right.

15
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:42,100
Thought maybe you'd like to look
at the bill of sale.

16
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:44,900
We'll look at it.

17
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:01,100
You say you got this from Johanson?

18
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,400
Mr. Maddow...

19
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:16,000
Mr. Maddow, is that Johanson's mark?

20
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:23,000
Johanson didn't have to make his mark.

21
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,900
He could write as good as you can.

22
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,300
Hang him!

23
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:25,700
I'm an ex-lawman.

24
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:27,400
You can check with the sheriff...

25
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,900
...Dave Ramsey, in St. Louis.

26
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:34,900
Get Johanson.

27
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:36,700
Let him tell me face-to-face.

28
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:40,000
For God's sake, check it out!

29
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:53,400
Are we gonna hang him,
or beat him to death?

30
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,400
Put him on his horse.

31
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,300
Wait a minute. The saddle.

32
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:00,100
You've no claim to that, Reno!

33
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:03,800
We got back Johanson's cattle.
And we got the man who took 'em.

34
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,400
I like to see justice done, but...

35
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,800
...I'm taking the saddle.

36
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:08,500
Anybody want to argue?

37
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:11,100
If he's a rustler,
he ain't got nothin' I'd want.

38
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,500
He's got something that I want.

39
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:17,900
I want his wallet.
I want it, and I'm gonna take it.

40
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:19,800
Captain, if he is a rustler...

41
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,200
...how come he didn't make a run for it
when he had a chance?

42
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:26,100
Wait a minute, Loomis.

43
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:30,400
Now, tell me...

44
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,200
...you bought some cattle from Johanson?

45
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:37,600
You saw the bill of sale.

46
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:41,000
With the mark where Johanson
was supposed to write his name.

47
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,600
What did Johanson look like?

48
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:51,900
He's about 30, dark hair,
dark eyes, heavyset...

49
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,400
...pock-marked face...

50
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:56,500
...regular features.

51
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:00,300
You have an eye for detail, haven't you?

52
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:02,700
I told you I was a lawman.

53
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
It was my job.

54
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,800
Heavyset, pock-marked...

55
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:08,700
...about 30...

56
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:11,700
Liar!

57
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,300
Johanson was 60.

58
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:29,100
Maybe it was his foreman
or something. I don't know.

59
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:32,000
But we can go back there and find out.
It's only a day's ride.

60
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:33,800
We could check it out.

61
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:35,200
Mr. Maddow...

62
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
...tell him.

63
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,500
I just came from the Johanson place.
His herd was gone.

64
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:47,200
Found Johanson and his wife
on the kitchen floor, gunned down...

65
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:49,900
...dead!

66
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:57,500
- Hang him!
- You're makin' a mistake!

67
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:08,600
Some people call this hell,
but you're still in Oklahoma Territory.

68
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:11,900
Save your breath.

69
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,800
I don't know who hung you, or why.

70
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,700
But if you're innocent,
the judge will set you free.

71
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:19,800
And, if you ain't...

72
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:23,200
...we'll have to take the trouble
of hanging you again.

73
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,300
Come on, get on your feet.

74
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:49,300
Water your mules and fill up
a bucket of water for the men.

75
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,900
Marshal Dave Bliss.
I hear you got a prisoner for me.

76
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
That's right, Marshal.

77
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,500
Feed and grain store,
right across the street.

78
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,800
Here's the key, you'll be needing it.

79
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:21,400
Watch out for him.
He's plumb loco.

80
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:08,600
Oh, God!

81
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,400
You've come to kill the prophet.

82
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:18,700
Take it easy, will ya?

83
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,100
You've come to kill the prophet.

84
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:23,500
Can you walk?

85
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:26,100
They're against me! They spy on me.

86
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:29,700
Oh, God, they're scared
of the wrath of God.

87
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,400
Come on, even the prison wagon
is better than this.

88
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,400
You've come to kill the prophet!

89
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:38,300
Hold it!

90
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:46,600
You've come to kill the prophet!

91
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,100
Stop, or I'll kill you!

92
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:53,000
What are you waiting for, Marshal?
Shoot him! Kill him!

93
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:56,400
What's wrong, Marshal?
Scared of cheating the hanging judge?

94
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:01,200
Kill him!

95
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:07,000
We'll testify for you, Marshal.

96
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:10,000
We'll tell 'em you did your best
to bring him in alive.

97
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,400
Hold it, damn you!

98
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:22,600
Kill him, Marshal!
It's too damn crowded in here, anyway!

99
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:16,300
You chained him. Now, you bury him.

100
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:25,400
That ain't gonna make the judge happy.

101
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:28,200
What was I supposed to do,
let him escape?

102
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:30,000
I ain't sayin' it was wrong.

103
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,300
I'm just sayin' it ain't gonna make
the judge happy.

104
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:35,000
Now that you've said it, William,
move 'em out.

105
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:16,500
Girls, girls, the tumbleweed wagon's here.

106
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,400
Save us the live ones, Marshal, huh?

107
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:21,700
Don't hang them all!

108
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,800
Here comes the tumbleweed wagon.

109
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:29,700
Some collection, Dave!

110
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:37,900
And you'll send the drapery material over.

111
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,400
As soon as it comes in.

112
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,500
- I'll be needing more perfume.
- A dozen bottles?

113
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,800
The cheapest, as long as it smells good.

114
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:46,000
It's not for my girls.

115
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,200
It's for the Saturday night cowhands.
They come off the range smelling...

116
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:51,100
Here comes the tumbleweed wagon!

117
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:52,800
Isn't that Billy the Kid?

118
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:56,800
Take a closer look.
Maybe you'll find your old man!

119
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,000
Hold it!

120
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,500
Let them step down,
so we can target practice on 'em.

121
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,300
All right, move 'em out.

122
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,100
Come on.

123
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,600
Feed's twice a day.

124
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:16,200
Eight in the morning,
four in the afternoon.

125
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:18,700
Unless you make trouble
and get yourselves short-chained...

126
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:21,800
...you get an hour a day recreation
in the prison yard.

127
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:27,100
Better find yourself a spot.

128
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:29,400
We're expecting another wagon in
this afternoon.

129
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,300
You'll get used to the smell.

130
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:36,200
If you don't, they got a sure cure for it:
They hang you!

131
00:23:58,300 --> 00:24:02,400
Sounds like Schmidt's fixin' to have
a little party this morning.

132
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:06,400
A party?

133
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,300
A hanging party.

134
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:13,500
Them's 200-pound sacks he's droppin'.

135
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:16,000
Gotta make sure them ropes hold up.

136
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:19,400
Always uses top-grade hemp,
Schmidt does.

137
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:23,300
Oils it, so it slides real good.

138
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:26,900
Snaps your neck like a dried-out twig.

139
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:30,900
A fine artist at his
trade, our Mr. Schmidt.

140
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,700
The bastard!

141
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:52,200
What kind of justice, to hang a man
before he's heard about his appeal?

142
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:10,300
Come in.

143
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,600
Leave him, without shackles.

144
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:44,100
All right, guard.

145
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,800
Your story checks out, Cooper.
You're free to go.

146
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:08,000
$11?

147
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:12,200
And 40 cents. That's all McCleod
had on him when we picked him up.

148
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:14,400
McCleod?

149
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:16,800
McCleod was running from the law.

150
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:19,000
Holed up at Johanson's place...

151
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,400
...killed that old man and his wife.
And then you blundered in.

152
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,800
A stranger lookin' to buy some cattle.
So McCleod sold you a few head.

153
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:29,500
He must have got
a pretty good laugh out of that.

154
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:31,400
You want to see what he looks like?

155
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,800
Come on. Come on.

156
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:58,400
McCleod took the money
he swindled from you...

157
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:00,800
...and came into town,
lookin' for a good time.

158
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:03,000
The Row, that's where we found him.

159
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:43,300
May God have mercy on his soul.

160
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,700
You're free to go, Cooper.

161
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:52,500
With my $11.40!

162
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:56,100
And the satisfaction of seeing the man
that got you into this mess hung.

163
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:58,800
What about the nine just men
who hung me?

164
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,600
Just give their description
to one of the deputies downstairs.

165
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:05,700
- They'll try to pick 'em up.
- Well, that's not good enough!

166
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:10,700
You take the law into your own hands...

167
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:14,200
...and I promise you, you'll swing
from one of those ropes out there.

168
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:17,400
I know a little bit about the law,
Your Honor.

169
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,700
That's right...

170
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:23,300
...you do.

171
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:27,400
Sit down, Cooper.

172
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:31,400
Please...

173
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:45,700
You were a lawman in St. Louis.

174
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:47,600
A damn good one.

175
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:52,000
I can use a good man, Cooper.

176
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,900
Pay, $250 a month.

177
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:58,300
That's $230 more than
you'd make as a cowhand...

178
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:01,800
...$232 more than
an army sergeant. Here.

179
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,400
If that hanging rope didn't kill you,
maybe my coffee will.

180
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,800
How much did you make in St. Louis?

181
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:11,900
It's $200 more than I made in St. Louis.

182
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,300
$250 plus expenses.

183
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:20,300
I warn you, the pay is
a little slow in coming.

184
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,000
There.

185
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:24,700
$200...

186
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:28,400
...plus $50 President Harrison owes you.
You'll get it when I get it.

187
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:30,200
You sound like you're a man...

188
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:33,600
...trying to give away money
and don't have too many takers.

189
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:36,700
You sound like you're a man protesting
the pay's too high. Don't.

190
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:39,300
If you sign on, you'll
earn every cent of it.

191
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,000
There you are.

192
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,800
The Oklahoma and Indian Territory...

193
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:46,300
...year of our Lord, 1889.
19 marshals.

194
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:49,000
I was authorized 60 when I came here.

195
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,500
I told the president
even that wasn't half enough.

196
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:54,400
Nineteen marshals and one court...

197
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:57,300
...to cover near 70,000 square miles.

198
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,600
A happy hunting ground
filled with bushwhackers...

199
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:03,300
...horse thieves, whiskey peddlers,
counterfeiters...

200
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:06,900
...hide peelers, marauders
that'll kill you for a hatband.

201
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:09,700
Now, that's why there's
a badge in my desk, Cooper.

202
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:13,400
Itching to sit on somebody's chest,
and no takers.

203
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Your marshals do cover
a lot of territory.

204
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:22,900
You'll ride circuit over an area
half again the size of Rhode Island.

205
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:25,400
If and when it's Marshal Cooper!

206
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:29,000
Pick up the badge, Mr. Cooper.

207
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:37,100
Pick up the badge or leave justice
to me and my men.

208
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:49,500
Those nine men...

209
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:54,300
...if you find them,
they're to be brought before me, alive!

210
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:02,400
That old horse should hold you for a spell.

211
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:07,300
- Good luck, Marshal.
- Thank you.

212
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:53,900
You're Cooper?

213
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:58,200
Judge sent a wire you was coming.

214
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:00,400
Wasn't there nobody outside?

215
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:03,300
Two men with shotguns.

216
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,300
I haven't had me a night's sleep
since we picked up the Swede.

217
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:09,500
How many men did you bring with you?

218
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:12,300
Can you have him ready to go
in a half hour?

219
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:15,800
Just the two of you?

220
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:21,000
The hotel here in town,
does it serve a good steak?

221
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,200
I better have somethin' to eat
before we leave.

222
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:26,500
If you're crazy enough
to try to take the Swede in alone...

223
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,600
...you got a right to try it
on a full stomach.

224
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:42,900
You're under arrest, Reno.

225
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:48,200
You're talking to me, Marshal?

226
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:49,900
Your name's Reno, isn't it?

227
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:55,100
I don't know what kind of town
you're running...

228
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,400
- This isn't my town.
- Well, I wouldn't know.

229
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,100
See, I just rode in.

230
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:02,100
I want to wash down
some trail dust, and...

231
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,400
All right, Marshal,
what do you say I done?

232
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,700
You don't remember me, do you?

233
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:25,000
When you hang a man,
you better look at him!

234
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:37,100
Don't go for that gun, Reno.

235
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:39,100
I need you alive.

236
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:15,900
- You know him?
- No.

237
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:20,300
Anybody here know him?
Goes by the name of Reno.

238
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:22,300
Come up here and take a look at him.

239
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:24,000
He must've just rode in.

240
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:26,600
That's what he said.
How much to bury him?

241
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:31,100
$15 ought to do a fair job, Marshal.

242
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:35,000
There's $7 there. I'll give you $8 more.

243
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:37,300
And mark it down, there.

244
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:41,200
Don't anybody leave!

245
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:44,400
I want everybody to write down
exactly what they saw.

246
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,200
I didn't see nothing, Marshal.

247
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,200
Fine. Then you say that in writing.

248
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:51,200
Nobody's gonna fault you, Marshal.
You give him every chance.

249
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:52,700
Say it in writing.

250
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:55,300
Marshal, I can't write.

251
00:35:56,600 --> 00:36:00,400
The sheriff here will write it down,
then you can put your mark on it.

252
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:03,900
There's a saddle out there
that belongs to me. I'll be takin' that.

253
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:07,300
Any of his friends or relatives show up,
want his horse or his belongings...

254
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:08,400
...you let me know, huh?

255
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:10,100
You can wire me at Fort Grant.

256
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,100
You gonna pick up the Swede now?

257
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:15,600
I'm going to have that steak now.

258
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:41,100
Oh, Swede, that's the one
the marshal just brought in.

259
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:43,500
Swede!

260
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:20,800
What was that all about?

261
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:23,000
That's Judge Fenton's orders.

262
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,600
Nobody comes in or out
that lady don't look at.

263
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:28,900
Marshal, the judge wants to see you,
right away.

264
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:45,700
Good work, Cooper. See?

265
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:50,000
The good Lord takes care
of those that do His work.

266
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:52,300
He just waltzed in,
and gave himself up.

267
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
I never wanted to hang you, mister.

268
00:37:58,300 --> 00:38:00,500
I asked them to give you a chance.

269
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:02,800
Maybe you remember that.

270
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:04,800
I remember that.

271
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:09,100
I was here in Fort Grant
looking for a grubstake...

272
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:13,000
...when I heard a marshal
with a hanging scar had killed Reno.

273
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:17,000
I knew then we'd...
we'd hung an innocent man...

274
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:19,900
...so I turned myself in.

275
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:20,800
The others?

276
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:24,000
He gave me their names. I've made out
the warrants for their arrests.

277
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:25,800
- Where?
- Red Creek.

278
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:29,700
Good. I'll be on my way.

279
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:34,600
All right. You do it your way.
You round 'em up and bring 'em back.

280
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:36,800
I don't know why you had to kill Reno.

281
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:38,700
It's in my report.

282
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:40,800
I wanted him alive.
I needed these names.

283
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:42,000
You got your names.

284
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:46,500
Mister, you make sure the rest
of those men get back here alive.

285
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:54,200
Jenkins, sit down, please.

286
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:43,100
You're under arrest.

287
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:44,400
Move!

288
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:57,100
I have seven warrants here.

289
00:40:58,100 --> 00:41:01,000
Matt Stone, Loomis, Maddow...

290
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:04,000
...Charley Blackfoot, Captain...

291
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:06,900
...Captain Wilson!
Say, what the hell is this all about?

292
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,300
A lynching.

293
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:14,400
Now, I understand four of these men
I'm after are out at the Big W.

294
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:16,500
Maddow and Miller, I'm not sure about.

295
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:20,100
Maddow, he owns a spread around here.
And Miller...

296
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:23,100
...Miller's a drifter.

297
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,300
These men you're looking for,
they're all leading citizens.

298
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:28,300
They're friends of mine.

299
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:32,200
These friends of yours are wanted
for conspiracy to commit murder.

300
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:37,600
If you'll put this man in jail, Sheriff...

301
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:40,100
...you and I can ride out to the Big W.

302
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:12,700
Sheriff! Sheriff Calhoun!

303
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:31,800
Rustlers, they took our herd.

304
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:34,600
They killed my pa and Danny.
Killed both of 'em!

305
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:37,100
I rode in and found 'em there.

306
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,600
Pa and Danny bushwhacked!

307
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:41,700
And the herd gone.

308
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:46,500
I won't be much good to you from here
on out. My back is giving me trouble.

309
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:48,100
You're in good hands, however.

310
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:50,100
This man here, is a federal marshal.

311
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:52,600
Don't give me that bad back stuff.

312
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:55,600
You've got your job,
I've got mine out at the Big W.

313
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:57,900
His father and his brother
were murdered.

314
00:42:57,800 --> 00:42:59,300
You a lawman or ain't you?

315
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,900
Not more than five, six hours ahead.

316
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,400
Now they must slow down.

317
00:44:03,100 --> 00:44:04,400
Well, we won't.

318
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:54,500
On your feet! Get up!

319
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:06,200
The cattle won't live another day
without water.

320
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:09,700
Mick, Willy, get 'em home.
Rafe, go with 'em!

321
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:17,600
You've got one minute to pray.

322
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:18,600
There'll be no hangin' here.

323
00:45:18,900 --> 00:45:22,100
They killed my father and brother.
They're gonna get what's comin' to 'em.

324
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:24,100
They'll get what the law says
is comin' to 'em.

325
00:45:24,100 --> 00:45:26,600
If you can't stomach hanging,
why don't you ride out?

326
00:45:26,700 --> 00:45:28,200
We'll do what needs doin' here.

327
00:45:28,300 --> 00:45:30,600
I'll say it one more time.

328
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:32,300
There's gonna be no hanging!

329
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,400
We're not turning three murderers loose!

330
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:38,100
That's right. You're turning them
over to me, the law.

331
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:40,000
I'll make sure they get to Fort Grant.

332
00:45:40,100 --> 00:45:42,500
Fort Grant's better than
a three day's ride from here.

333
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:43,900
You'll never make it alone.

334
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:46,500
I didn't plan on makin' it alone.

335
00:45:48,100 --> 00:45:50,400
You men got a $10 posse fee comin'.

336
00:45:50,900 --> 00:45:53,300
I can't guarantee
the government's gonna pay any more.

337
00:45:53,300 --> 00:45:56,100
Every man who sticks with me
will get an extra $10...

338
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,700
...if I have to pay for it myself.

339
00:45:59,300 --> 00:46:01,100
I'll take my $10 now!

340
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:03,000
I've got your name. They'll send it to you.

341
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,500
We'll put in for the money
ourselves, Marshal.

342
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:14,300
The men these rustlers killed,
they were my friends.

343
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:16,900
These three, they are for hanging!

344
00:46:21,900 --> 00:46:23,100
Leave us, Marshal...

345
00:46:23,900 --> 00:46:25,700
...for just ten minutes.

346
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:29,600
Five minutes!

347
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:01,800
On your feet!

348
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:03,600
Thank you, Marshal.

349
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:07,300
I just want you to know,
we had nothing to do with the killing.

350
00:47:07,300 --> 00:47:08,100
Shut up.

351
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:10,600
We rustled the herd all right.
But me and Ben, we...

352
00:47:10,700 --> 00:47:12,500
Didn't I tell you to shut your mouth?!

353
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:15,000
My brother's telling the truth.
He done it!

354
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:18,200
All right, Marshal! All right.

355
00:47:42,700 --> 00:47:45,700
All right, saddle up those horses
and nothing foolish.

356
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:57,100
You're very kind, Marshal.
Would you be my friend, too?

357
00:47:57,100 --> 00:47:58,800
Forget about it!

358
00:48:02,100 --> 00:48:06,300
Say, I seen you when you drug
that ol' Stone into jail.

359
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:11,300
I thought that was really something.
I just about died right then and there.

360
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:16,200
I picked up my two amigos here,
and rustled this fat herd...

361
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:19,500
...and headed lickety-split
for south of the border.

362
00:48:21,700 --> 00:48:23,900
You know something?

363
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:28,200
Mister... Deputy Marshal...

364
00:48:29,300 --> 00:48:33,100
You know when I woked up, and seen
that gun pointing right at my mouth...

365
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:36,400
...and you standing at
the other end of it...

366
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:41,300
...I said to myself, "Miller, you move
one inch and you're a dead man.

367
00:48:41,300 --> 00:48:44,500
"This man's about to blow your head off."

368
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,700
I mean, what them boys said was right.

369
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:49,600
We guilty as hell.

370
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,700
You know, when we get to Fort Grant...

371
00:48:57,500 --> 00:48:59,200
...all they gonna do is hang us.

372
00:49:01,100 --> 00:49:02,900
I tell you what...

373
00:49:03,700 --> 00:49:08,200
Why don't you be real smart,
and use your head, you know...

374
00:49:09,500 --> 00:49:11,400
And let us go.

375
00:49:12,300 --> 00:49:13,500
Just let us go.

376
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:14,800
We outnumber you three to one.

377
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:16,800
You can tell 'em that we jumped you.

378
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:21,000
And the boys and I, you know, we ain't
gonna be around to call you a liar.

379
00:49:21,900 --> 00:49:23,300
Get aboard, Miller.

380
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:28,800
I can't get aboard
'cause my hands are tied.

381
00:49:29,900 --> 00:49:32,100
You gonna have to help me.

382
00:49:37,700 --> 00:49:39,100
I said get aboard!

383
00:49:39,300 --> 00:49:42,700
You are never gonna get me alive
to Fort Grant, boy.

384
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:46,300
Then I'll get you there dead! Boy!

385
00:50:59,500 --> 00:51:02,000
Get down. The horses need rest.

386
00:51:28,700 --> 00:51:30,200
Start walking.

387
00:53:20,700 --> 00:53:22,300
Get aboard, Miller.

388
00:54:43,500 --> 00:54:44,400
Kill me!

389
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:49,400
Kill me!

390
00:54:54,200 --> 00:54:55,500
Kill...

391
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:28,900
Please, please.

392
00:55:29,100 --> 00:55:30,800
I didn't set out to touch her.

393
00:55:30,900 --> 00:55:33,700
I was drunk, full of rotgut whiskey.

394
00:55:33,800 --> 00:55:35,700
I didn't know what I was doing.

395
00:55:36,100 --> 00:55:37,500
Please, my family.

396
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:39,000
Take him away.

397
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:41,500
Please, my family.

398
00:55:42,100 --> 00:55:43,900
I didn't know what I was doing.

399
00:55:45,900 --> 00:55:47,700
Samuel Dodd.

400
00:55:47,800 --> 00:55:49,700
Charge: whiskey peddling.

401
00:55:51,700 --> 00:55:53,400
Here, Your Honor.

402
00:56:02,900 --> 00:56:05,900
Court's adjourned.
Eight o'clock tomorrow morning.

403
00:56:06,100 --> 00:56:09,000
All rise until His Honor has
left the courtroom.

404
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:45,000
The sheriff in Red Creek wired
you were bringing three killers in alone.

405
00:56:45,100 --> 00:56:48,900
That was over two days ago.
I near gave you up for dead.

406
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,100
You're a damn fool, Cooper.

407
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:54,400
A bloody damn fool, and the best there is.

408
00:56:54,500 --> 00:56:55,600
Hear that?

409
00:56:55,900 --> 00:56:58,700
Wake up, you godforsaken people, you!

410
00:56:58,800 --> 00:57:02,000
The best there is,
this man here that works for you!

411
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:03,600
For your government. Our country!

412
00:57:03,700 --> 00:57:06,900
The best country on the earth,
because of men like Marshal Jed Cooper!

413
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:08,000
I'm proud of you!

414
00:57:08,100 --> 00:57:11,500
They'll hear about this, not just
in the territories, but in Washington.

415
00:57:11,400 --> 00:57:13,200
Across the length and breadth
of this nation...

416
00:57:13,300 --> 00:57:15,300
...they're gonna know
that name, Jed Cooper!

417
00:57:15,300 --> 00:57:17,800
Now, what have you got
to say about that, boy?!

418
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:56,000
Anything else I can do for you, Marshal?

419
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:09,800
Good Lord, you bring back half of these,
you'll have a wagonload.

420
00:59:10,100 --> 00:59:13,100
Well, you know me, Judge.
I like a lot of company.

421
00:59:13,500 --> 00:59:15,100
How long you figure to take?

422
00:59:15,300 --> 00:59:18,400
Six, seven weeks, give or take a month.

423
00:59:18,800 --> 00:59:20,300
Come in.

424
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:23,100
Well, well, well.

425
00:59:24,900 --> 00:59:27,900
The prodigal returneth
from a fate worse than death.

426
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:29,000
Was that your idea?

427
00:59:29,100 --> 00:59:30,300
You fell right in my arms...

428
00:59:30,300 --> 00:59:32,300
...and since The Row happened to be
the closest haven...

429
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:35,100
...and since you didn't appear to need
the doctor's services...

430
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:37,300
Well, I'll be on my way.

431
00:59:38,100 --> 00:59:39,200
See you, Jed.

432
00:59:40,700 --> 00:59:43,200
Aside from the girl
who served me breakfast...

433
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:45,700
...I didn't see anybody else,
that I remember.

434
00:59:46,200 --> 00:59:47,400
Do I owe them a bill?

435
00:59:47,400 --> 00:59:50,100
Of course. Just put it
on your expense account.

436
00:59:50,500 --> 00:59:51,900
Under what?

437
00:59:52,500 --> 00:59:56,800
You're going to make me
one hell of a lawman, you are, Jed.

438
00:59:57,200 --> 00:59:58,600
Judge...

439
00:59:59,100 --> 01:00:00,900
...about those three I brought in...

440
01:00:01,100 --> 01:00:02,300
All taken care of.

441
01:00:02,500 --> 01:00:05,700
I don't think they spent
as pleasant an evening as you did.

442
01:00:06,300 --> 01:00:09,300
I wanted to talk to you
about the two boys, Ben and Billy-Joe.

443
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:12,100
Later, later.
Write it down, when you've got time.

444
01:00:12,100 --> 01:00:14,500
I just wanted to say,
as long as I'm here...

445
01:00:14,600 --> 01:00:17,100
...that only Miller is to be charged
with murder.

446
01:00:17,600 --> 01:00:20,900
If it wasn't for those two boys,
I might not have made it.

447
01:00:20,900 --> 01:00:22,200
Miller tried to kill me.

448
01:00:22,200 --> 01:00:24,800
If one or both of them
had pitched in and given him a hand...

449
01:00:24,800 --> 01:00:27,100
Did they pitch in to help you
subdue Miller?

450
01:00:27,600 --> 01:00:29,600
- Oh, no.
- Write it in your report.

451
01:00:30,100 --> 01:00:33,400
Hey, Marshal, if you catch
a whiskey peddler...

452
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:36,300
...let him go and bring
the whiskey back this time!

453
01:00:37,900 --> 01:00:41,300
Hey, Ace, mind if I call
on that señorita of yours?

454
01:00:41,500 --> 01:00:45,800
I hear they got some wicked women
in Los Gatos. Snatch us a few!

455
01:00:48,700 --> 01:00:51,100
So long, Ace. Good hunting!

456
01:00:51,800 --> 01:00:53,400
Bliss is dead.

457
01:00:55,500 --> 01:00:57,500
Bliss? What happened?

458
01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:02,900
He went to pick up one of the Walker boys
at the Elmwood jail.

459
01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:06,400
The Walker clan, all seven of them,
were waiting.

460
01:01:07,400 --> 01:01:10,400
They shot him down, right there
in the middle of the main street.

461
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:13,400
Not a soul in Elmwood
lifted a hand to help him.

462
01:01:16,700 --> 01:01:18,400
I owed my life to Bliss.

463
01:01:18,600 --> 01:01:22,100
He was a man with a backbone,
a lawman...

464
01:01:23,400 --> 01:01:26,100
Won't be easy to fill his shoes.

465
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:28,600
No, it won't.

466
01:01:32,500 --> 01:01:35,500
Well, I'd better get on back to Red Creek.

467
01:01:37,700 --> 01:01:39,700
When the local sheriff wired you...

468
01:01:39,800 --> 01:01:43,500
...I don't suppose he told you I arrested
one of the men who tried to lynch me.

469
01:01:43,400 --> 01:01:46,000
I was goin' after the rest of them,
when this business came up.

470
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:47,200
The man you arrested?

471
01:01:47,200 --> 01:01:48,900
Name's Stone.
He's in the Red Creek jail.

472
01:01:49,100 --> 01:01:51,900
Good. That ought to hold him
till you're finished here.

473
01:01:51,900 --> 01:01:53,900
- Finished here?
- Testifying.

474
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:55,700
Testifying? When?

475
01:01:55,800 --> 01:01:59,200
I've got a backlog of cases built up
from here to Sunday.

476
01:01:59,400 --> 01:02:02,500
I happen to have a prisoner
over there in that cardboard jail.

477
01:02:02,600 --> 01:02:04,600
The sheriff who's guarding him
has got a bad back.

478
01:02:04,600 --> 01:02:07,900
- And if I don't get back over there...
- You'll get back, Cooper.

479
01:02:08,300 --> 01:02:11,400
You'll get back when I tell you
you're free to go.

480
01:02:14,600 --> 01:02:16,000
Cooper!

481
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:21,400
You can be the best I've ever had.
The best there is, if you remember this:

482
01:02:21,400 --> 01:02:25,000
You work for the government.
You work for justice!

483
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,900
Excuse me, Judge.
I heard there were three new prisoners.

484
01:02:36,800 --> 01:02:40,100
Marshal, why don't you take Miss Warren
down to the cellblock?

485
01:03:11,600 --> 01:03:13,600
Two of them are just boys.

486
01:03:13,900 --> 01:03:16,000
Old enough to rustle cattle.

487
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:18,000
You want them to hang?

488
01:03:18,300 --> 01:03:22,200
I just want them to get a fair trial.
Who do you want to hang?

489
01:03:28,100 --> 01:03:30,100
We all have our ghosts, Marshal.

490
01:03:30,800 --> 01:03:32,800
You hunt your way...

491
01:03:33,200 --> 01:03:34,800
...I hunt mine.

492
01:03:51,700 --> 01:03:54,200
All right. You claim
you didn't pull the trigger.

493
01:03:55,400 --> 01:03:57,600
Let's forget about the killings.

494
01:03:58,300 --> 01:04:02,600
Rustling is a hanging offense
and they are all guilty!

495
01:04:02,800 --> 01:04:04,200
All three of them.

496
01:04:04,300 --> 01:04:07,200
No matter whose idea it was,
they're all guilty!

497
01:04:08,200 --> 01:04:09,300
That's the law!

498
01:04:09,400 --> 01:04:10,200
Object!

499
01:04:10,500 --> 01:04:11,700
Sustained.

500
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:13,600
You, sir...

501
01:04:16,200 --> 01:04:18,700
You will elicit facts from the witness.

502
01:04:18,800 --> 01:04:21,100
I will tell the jury what's the law.

503
01:04:21,300 --> 01:04:24,100
Yes, sir.
No further questions, Your Honor.

504
01:04:24,300 --> 01:04:28,700
The jury will disregard all the
prosecution's remarks concerning the law.

505
01:04:31,800 --> 01:04:33,200
All right, son...

506
01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:35,700
...you may step down.

507
01:04:40,600 --> 01:04:42,100
Call your next witness.

508
01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:44,600
Marshal Jedediah Cooper.

509
01:04:52,500 --> 01:04:54,600
Do you solemnly swear
to tell the whole truth...

510
01:04:54,700 --> 01:04:56,900
...and nothing but the truth,
so help you God?

511
01:04:56,900 --> 01:04:59,300
Marshal, at the time
of their apprehension...

512
01:04:59,400 --> 01:05:02,800
...did any of these three defendants
deny their guilt?

513
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:04,900
No, but on the trail back here...

514
01:05:05,100 --> 01:05:08,000
We are not interested
in the trip back to Fort Grant.

515
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:12,300
It was a heroic journey. The whole court,
the whole territory is grateful.

516
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:14,100
I think something that happened...

517
01:05:14,100 --> 01:05:16,500
...on the trail back here
has a bearing on the case.

518
01:05:16,600 --> 01:05:18,400
Did something happen
that leads you to believe...

519
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:21,100
...that one, or all three
of these defendants are innocent?

520
01:05:21,200 --> 01:05:24,500
Of murder, yes. You see,
both Ben and Billy-Joe told me...

521
01:05:24,500 --> 01:05:28,600
Marshal, this court is not concerned
with hearsay evidence.

522
01:05:28,800 --> 01:05:31,100
This court requires facts.

523
01:05:31,400 --> 01:05:35,400
The defendants, all three, are charged
with murder and rustling. Facts!

524
01:05:35,600 --> 01:05:37,700
The only matter that concerns this court!

525
01:05:37,700 --> 01:05:40,100
I thought this court
was concerned with justice!

526
01:05:40,200 --> 01:05:42,400
Justice is my province, Marshal.

527
01:05:42,600 --> 01:05:44,500
Mine, and mine alone.

528
01:05:45,300 --> 01:05:48,700
You'll confine yourself to giving
direct answers to direct questions...

529
01:05:48,800 --> 01:05:50,800
...or find yourself in contempt of court.
Proceed.

530
01:05:50,700 --> 01:05:53,200
One of those boys is 18,
the other's only 16...

531
01:05:53,200 --> 01:05:53,900
That'll cost you $10.

532
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:55,800
They've never been
in trouble with the law...

533
01:05:55,800 --> 01:05:57,400
- $20!
- If it wasn't for them, I wouldn't...

534
01:05:57,300 --> 01:06:01,700
$30! One more word
and you'll spend 30 days in the hole!

535
01:06:02,700 --> 01:06:05,800
Do you have any further questions
for this witness?

536
01:06:06,100 --> 01:06:08,500
No more questions, Your Honor.

537
01:06:10,700 --> 01:06:13,900
Then you may step down, Marshal.

538
01:06:58,700 --> 01:07:00,200
Sheriff Ray Calhoun.

539
01:07:00,600 --> 01:07:02,100
Red Creek.

540
01:07:02,400 --> 01:07:04,000
I recognize you.

541
01:07:08,200 --> 01:07:12,000
I want to congratulate you on the job
you did bringing in those rustlers.

542
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:15,500
You mean you rode all the way over here
from Red Creek...

543
01:07:15,700 --> 01:07:17,700
...bad back and all, just to tell me that?

544
01:07:18,900 --> 01:07:19,900
No.

545
01:07:20,800 --> 01:07:22,000
Stone's dead.

546
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:25,900
What happened, Calhoun?

547
01:07:28,100 --> 01:07:31,300
It didn't make no sense,
him sittin' in that cell going crazy...

548
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:33,800
...the town without no blacksmith.

549
01:07:37,900 --> 01:07:41,200
He promised that if I turned him loose
every day for a couple of hours...

550
01:07:41,200 --> 01:07:45,600
...to work at his trade, that he'd come
back to his cell each night. And, he did.

551
01:07:45,600 --> 01:07:47,900
He came back every night but one.

552
01:07:48,500 --> 01:07:52,100
I rode out to his home,
a home where I had many a dinner.

553
01:07:52,700 --> 01:07:54,500
The home of a friend.

554
01:07:55,100 --> 01:07:58,500
I had to bring him back and put him
in his cell at gunpoint.

555
01:07:59,300 --> 01:08:00,900
He made a break for it.

556
01:08:01,100 --> 01:08:03,800
I tried to shoot low,
but I'm not very good at that.

557
01:08:09,800 --> 01:08:12,800
I heard you paid $800 to the skunk
who murdered the Johansons...

558
01:08:12,800 --> 01:08:14,300
...and sold you their herd.

559
01:08:16,400 --> 01:08:17,900
That's right.

560
01:08:18,100 --> 01:08:21,100
How much did you get back
when they were caught?

561
01:08:22,200 --> 01:08:24,000
$11 and 40 cents.

562
01:08:27,900 --> 01:08:31,100
There's $800 in this
envelope. It's yours...

563
01:08:31,600 --> 01:08:34,900
...or you can keep the 100 head,
prime, every one of 'em.

564
01:08:36,200 --> 01:08:40,300
Don't have much use for cattle
these days. Here's $10.

565
01:08:41,200 --> 01:08:42,500
Keep it.

566
01:08:49,800 --> 01:08:51,700
$11...

567
01:08:53,900 --> 01:08:55,300
...and 40 cents...

568
01:08:55,300 --> 01:08:57,400
...for the aggravation they caused me.

569
01:08:57,900 --> 01:09:00,200
Now, you take that bad back of yours...

570
01:09:00,300 --> 01:09:04,600
...right over to Red Creek and tell
your friends we're even, money-wise.

571
01:09:20,600 --> 01:09:22,000
It's no deal.

572
01:09:23,500 --> 01:09:25,900
He figures you still owe him
for a lynching.

573
01:09:26,200 --> 01:09:29,100
I told you, you never should have
offered him the money.

574
01:09:29,500 --> 01:09:33,500
All right, now that makes
three mistakes we made:

575
01:09:34,400 --> 01:09:37,700
The money, we hung an innocent man...

576
01:09:38,700 --> 01:09:41,000
...and we didn't finish the job.

577
01:09:42,400 --> 01:09:44,600
We can't undo the first two...

578
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,100
...but we can still finish the job.

579
01:09:54,800 --> 01:09:56,800
I didn't hear that, Captain Wilson.

580
01:09:57,100 --> 01:09:58,500
I didn't hear none of it.

581
01:10:03,700 --> 01:10:05,100
I'm riding back to Red Creek.

582
01:10:05,500 --> 01:10:07,500
Are you coming with me?

583
01:10:13,400 --> 01:10:16,500
Charley, you've been with me
better than five years.

584
01:10:18,400 --> 01:10:20,000
Good years, Captain.

585
01:10:20,400 --> 01:10:24,500
Maybe if it was my land
I was fighting to hold. No, Captain.

586
01:10:25,300 --> 01:10:29,100
If that marshal wants Charley Blackfoot,
he's gonna have to find him.

587
01:10:34,400 --> 01:10:35,800
Sorry, Captain Wilson.

588
01:10:36,100 --> 01:10:40,000
Maddow, you're damn near my age.
You wouldn't last six months in that jail.

589
01:10:40,200 --> 01:10:43,200
I don't intend to try to.
I can still ride pretty good.

590
01:10:43,300 --> 01:10:45,000
You can shoot even better.

591
01:10:45,100 --> 01:10:46,600
Sorry, Captain.

592
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:49,500
Maddow, he'll come after you.
He'll keep comin'.

593
01:10:49,500 --> 01:10:50,800
You'll be nothin' but an animal.

594
01:10:50,900 --> 01:10:52,900
An animal running scared.

595
01:10:54,500 --> 01:10:55,800
Sorry, Captain.

596
01:11:07,800 --> 01:11:09,600
How about you two? You sure?

597
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:12,000
Tommy?

598
01:11:13,900 --> 01:11:15,600
It was wrong to hang that man.

599
01:11:15,900 --> 01:11:17,400
We all know it now.

600
01:11:18,700 --> 01:11:21,000
I was hoping we could square it with him.

601
01:11:21,400 --> 01:11:24,400
My wife, she was kind of hopin' it, too.

602
01:11:26,500 --> 01:11:27,500
Loomis?

603
01:11:29,900 --> 01:11:32,000
I'm 37, 38, I...

604
01:11:32,800 --> 01:11:35,000
...don't rightly know for sure.

605
01:11:35,500 --> 01:11:38,000
I started drifting when I was just a kid.

606
01:11:39,100 --> 01:11:41,400
These last few years, working for you...

607
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:47,600
It was the first home I ever knew.

608
01:11:49,200 --> 01:11:52,500
Saved a few dollars,
thinking of findin' myself a woman...

609
01:11:53,500 --> 01:11:57,300
...staking off a few acres of my own,
when this come up.

610
01:11:57,600 --> 01:11:59,600
You mean, when I brought it up.

611
01:12:00,500 --> 01:12:02,500
You didn't force me
to ride with you, Captain.

612
01:12:04,500 --> 01:12:07,600
We thought we was doing the right thing.
We was.

613
01:12:08,500 --> 01:12:10,800
Hanging the wrong man
don't change that.

614
01:12:10,800 --> 01:12:12,600
Five years, even ten...

615
01:12:13,700 --> 01:12:17,200
You two can survive it and still come out
to live some kind of life.

616
01:12:17,200 --> 01:12:18,800
What kind, Captain?

617
01:12:19,200 --> 01:12:22,900
I been a free man.
That's the only kind of life I know.

618
01:12:23,300 --> 01:12:25,800
My wife, Thelma, she's a young woman.

619
01:12:26,400 --> 01:12:28,700
She wants kids, a family.

620
01:12:29,500 --> 01:12:31,800
Even if I asked her to wait for me...

621
01:12:32,100 --> 01:12:34,300
...even if she said she would...

622
01:12:34,900 --> 01:12:36,500
...I couldn't be sure.

623
01:12:42,300 --> 01:12:43,700
Let's ride, gentlemen.

624
01:13:03,700 --> 01:13:05,400
Hey, mister, where's the hotel?

625
01:13:05,400 --> 01:13:07,800
Down the street, but keep goin',
it's full up.

626
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,100
The whole town's full up for this hanging.

627
01:13:10,300 --> 01:13:12,600
I hear they got tents set up,
off the boondocks.

628
01:13:12,800 --> 01:13:14,300
Thank you kindly.

629
01:13:35,700 --> 01:13:37,400
- Who is it?
- Open up.

630
01:13:45,600 --> 01:13:47,600
I came here to tell you
about the biggest thing...

631
01:13:47,700 --> 01:13:50,800
...that happened in this territory.
Bigger than statehood.

632
01:13:50,900 --> 01:13:53,900
People showin' up by the wagonful,
men, women, and children...

633
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:57,000
...all just to see your lousy hanging.
- That's enough.

634
01:13:57,400 --> 01:14:00,700
- To see your circus, a six-man hanging.
- I said that's enough!

635
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:02,100
You stink of whiskey.

636
01:14:02,300 --> 01:14:04,700
Just go back to your room.
Lie down, and sleep it off!

637
01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:06,500
You're lynching those boys, why?

638
01:14:07,500 --> 01:14:08,800
Why?

639
01:14:13,500 --> 01:14:15,000
Because of you, Cooper.

640
01:14:17,700 --> 01:14:21,600
Because of that beautiful,
that magnificent journey you took...

641
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:23,700
...to bring three killers to justice.

642
01:14:24,600 --> 01:14:27,800
If the law didn't hang them,
the next posse that goes out would say...

643
01:14:27,800 --> 01:14:30,600
..."Hang 'em, and hang 'em high!
There's no justice in Fort Grant."

644
01:14:30,700 --> 01:14:32,300
And if there's no justice in Fort Grant...

645
01:14:32,200 --> 01:14:34,200
...there'll be no statehood
for this territory.

646
01:14:34,300 --> 01:14:36,300
I don't care how you slice it.

647
01:14:36,700 --> 01:14:39,100
Whether it's nine men out on a plain
with a dirty rope...

648
01:14:39,100 --> 01:14:42,600
...or a judge with his robes on
in front of the American flag...

649
01:14:42,700 --> 01:14:45,900
...those boys are gonna be just as dead
as if they'd been lynched!

650
01:14:46,800 --> 01:14:50,400
That's right, Cooper, just as dead,
but they won't have been lynched.

651
01:14:50,500 --> 01:14:53,000
They'll have been judged.
If you can't see the difference...

652
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:55,900
...you'd better take off that star,
and right now!

653
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,600
Not just yet, Your Honor.

654
01:15:02,600 --> 01:15:08,300
Yes, we'll gather at the river.

655
01:15:09,400 --> 01:15:14,300
The beautiful river.

656
01:15:16,700 --> 01:15:21,500
Gather with the saints at the river.

657
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:28,300
That flows by the throne of God.

658
01:15:40,100 --> 01:15:43,000
Cold beer and sarsparilla
for the kiddies...

659
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:45,600
...pretzels, candy bars, cold beer.

660
01:15:51,700 --> 01:15:55,500
Last chance. The drapes can wait.
Sure you won't change your mind?

661
01:15:55,500 --> 01:15:59,700
Sophie, I told you before,
there's only one hanging I'm interested in.

662
01:16:25,200 --> 01:16:26,200
Let me go!

663
01:16:26,100 --> 01:16:28,300
No! I said no!

664
01:17:54,200 --> 01:17:58,100
Get your cold beer, sarsaparilla.

665
01:18:14,100 --> 01:18:16,200
Hey, what are you doing?

666
01:18:16,700 --> 01:18:21,500
Can't you make it tomorrow?
I don't want to miss the hanging.

667
01:18:28,100 --> 01:18:31,200
"Confess thy iniquities and transgressions
unto the Lord...

668
01:18:31,200 --> 01:18:32,900
"...and he will forgive thee thy sins."

669
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:35,700
- Now, Preacher?
- Patience.

670
01:18:38,900 --> 01:18:42,600
"Blessed is the man that walketh not
in the counsel of the ungodly...

671
01:18:42,900 --> 01:18:45,100
"...nor standeth in the way of sinners...

672
01:18:45,200 --> 01:18:47,600
"...nor sitteth in the
seat of the scornful.

673
01:18:48,300 --> 01:18:52,000
"But his delight is in
the law of the Lord...

674
01:18:53,200 --> 01:18:57,000
"...and in His law doth he meditate,
day and night.

675
01:18:58,400 --> 01:19:02,500
"And he shall be like a tree
planted by the rivers of water...

676
01:19:03,100 --> 01:19:06,200
"...that bringeth forth
his fruit in His season.

677
01:19:07,200 --> 01:19:09,500
"His leaf shall not wither...

678
01:19:09,700 --> 01:19:12,000
"...and whatever he doeth shall prosper."

679
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:13,800
Amen.

680
01:19:17,400 --> 01:19:20,100
We will now sing "Rock of Ages."

681
01:19:20,300 --> 01:19:22,900
Get your cold beer and pretzels!

682
01:19:23,400 --> 01:19:25,800
Rock of ages

683
01:19:27,300 --> 01:19:29,900
Cleft for me

684
01:19:31,100 --> 01:19:37,400
Let me hide myself in thee

685
01:19:38,500 --> 01:19:42,200
Like the water

686
01:19:42,600 --> 01:19:45,100
And the blood

687
01:19:45,900 --> 01:19:48,400
From thy wounded...

688
01:21:00,900 --> 01:21:02,100
You have last requests?

689
01:21:03,900 --> 01:21:07,200
- Do you have last requests?
- I'd sure like me a chew of tobacco.

690
01:21:07,900 --> 01:21:10,700
What's the matter, hangman?
You afraid I'll choke and...

691
01:21:10,700 --> 01:21:12,700
...cheat you out of your hangin' fee?

692
01:21:25,500 --> 01:21:27,200
Put it in my pocket.

693
01:21:53,400 --> 01:21:54,400
Now, Preacher?

694
01:21:54,800 --> 01:21:57,100
You may say your piece now.

695
01:21:59,800 --> 01:22:02,900
You are now looking for the last time...

696
01:22:04,100 --> 01:22:07,200
...at the mortal body
of Francis Elroy Duffy...

697
01:22:07,700 --> 01:22:09,900
...born to John and Edna Duffy...

698
01:22:09,800 --> 01:22:10,900
You have last requests?

699
01:22:11,100 --> 01:22:13,600
...good God-fearing folks...

700
01:22:13,900 --> 01:22:17,800
...who raised me up to be
a good man and a good Christian.

701
01:22:18,400 --> 01:22:20,700
Bye, Ben. Bye.

702
01:22:21,600 --> 01:22:24,000
A good husband to my beloved wife.

703
01:22:24,600 --> 01:22:26,700
A good father to my children...

704
01:22:27,300 --> 01:22:28,500
...whom I leave behind...

705
01:22:29,300 --> 01:22:31,100
...hoping that they...

706
01:22:31,400 --> 01:22:34,000
...and all you, will learn...

707
01:22:34,500 --> 01:22:35,800
You have a last request?

708
01:22:35,800 --> 01:22:38,100
...this here lesson which I leave you with.

709
01:22:54,700 --> 01:22:57,200
When you take the devil
into your mouth...

710
01:22:58,000 --> 01:22:59,300
...you are doomed!

711
01:23:00,200 --> 01:23:03,000
For he is lying there in wait for you...

712
01:23:03,700 --> 01:23:05,800
...inside that bottle of whiskey...

713
01:23:06,500 --> 01:23:09,300
...waiting for you
to take him into your mouth.

714
01:23:09,500 --> 01:23:11,000
You have a last request?

715
01:23:13,300 --> 01:23:15,900
Tell him to shut up,
and let's get it over with.

716
01:23:18,700 --> 01:23:23,000
Liquor is the most foul and evil thing
in this here world.

717
01:23:24,100 --> 01:23:27,500
It has destroyed good men like myself.

718
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:31,800
You have a last request?

719
01:23:58,400 --> 01:24:02,000
So take these words of advice,
and remember...

720
01:24:02,900 --> 01:24:07,700
...you heard them from a poor sinner,
who's got no more cause to lie...

721
01:24:08,900 --> 01:24:11,500
...'cause he's going to meet his Maker...

722
01:24:12,200 --> 01:24:13,800
...and now he's ready.

723
01:24:15,500 --> 01:24:17,100
That's all I've got to say.

724
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:29,100
Will you all bow your heads
for one final prayer.

725
01:24:37,600 --> 01:24:40,600
May God have mercy
on their poor souls...

726
01:24:41,300 --> 01:24:42,700
...as He has...

727
01:24:42,800 --> 01:24:45,200
...upon all the faithful departed.

728
01:24:46,700 --> 01:24:47,400
Amen.

729
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:23,500
Dear God!

730
01:26:30,500 --> 01:26:32,700
All right, all right, I'm coming.

731
01:26:35,200 --> 01:26:36,200
Judge Fenton...

732
01:26:36,500 --> 01:26:38,800
I come to praise, Sophie,
not to close you down.

733
01:26:38,800 --> 01:26:41,800
- I thought maybe you came to...
- Now, Sophie. Now...

734
01:26:41,700 --> 01:26:44,800
Well, now at least I know what it takes
to get you in here.

735
01:26:45,300 --> 01:26:46,800
How is he this morning?

736
01:26:46,900 --> 01:26:49,500
I've never seen a man
who has more right to be dead.

737
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:51,600
I gotta see him, now.
Can't wait any longer.

738
01:26:51,700 --> 01:26:53,700
Check with Rachel. She's still in charge.

739
01:26:57,400 --> 01:26:59,000
She stayed all night?

740
01:26:59,200 --> 01:27:02,200
You heard Doc.
If Rachel hadn't stopped the bleeding...

741
01:27:02,100 --> 01:27:05,300
Somebody had to stay with him.
A couple of my girls volunteered.

742
01:27:05,300 --> 01:27:06,700
Rachel wouldn't have it.

743
01:27:06,900 --> 01:27:09,600
Same room, honeymoon suite,
at the head of the stairs.

744
01:27:09,500 --> 01:27:10,500
Thanks, Sophie.

745
01:27:10,700 --> 01:27:12,500
- Good morning, Judge.
- Good morning, dear.

746
01:27:12,500 --> 01:27:15,200
- Anything I can do for you?
- No, thank you, dear.

747
01:27:23,600 --> 01:27:26,400
It's all right, Judge.
I'm just about finishing up.

748
01:27:31,200 --> 01:27:34,100
I heard about what you did, Rachel.
I'm grateful.

749
01:27:34,400 --> 01:27:36,400
Why don't you sit down?

750
01:27:39,400 --> 01:27:40,400
Can I get you something?

751
01:27:40,500 --> 01:27:44,500
No, thank you. I shouldn't have done this.
I may never get up again.

752
01:27:55,900 --> 01:27:57,100
Who did it, Jed?

753
01:28:01,400 --> 01:28:05,500
Much as you want them, Jed,
I want them more. I need them.

754
01:28:09,700 --> 01:28:14,400
It's bad enough when a deputy gets
bushwhacked on some lonely trail, but...

755
01:28:15,200 --> 01:28:18,800
...here, in Fort Grant, in broad daylight!

756
01:28:20,400 --> 01:28:22,900
We can't let them get away with that.

757
01:28:23,500 --> 01:28:25,100
Now, who did it?

758
01:28:27,700 --> 01:28:30,100
I'll go after them myself.

759
01:28:31,700 --> 01:28:33,500
For the love of God, son!

760
01:28:33,700 --> 01:28:36,100
God's got nothing to do with it.

761
01:28:37,200 --> 01:28:39,000
I'll take care of them.

762
01:28:53,900 --> 01:28:55,400
Want me to take over?

763
01:28:55,700 --> 01:28:56,700
No.

764
01:28:58,300 --> 01:28:59,300
Thank you.

765
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:01,900
You could use a good night's sleep.

766
01:29:05,900 --> 01:29:09,500
All right, honey. But one of these days
he's going to get better...

767
01:29:09,500 --> 01:29:11,800
...and you're gonna have
a man on your hands.

768
01:30:29,300 --> 01:30:30,600
You're perspiring.

769
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:36,300
Don't drink your milk so fast.

770
01:30:47,200 --> 01:30:48,200
You look tired.

771
01:30:48,600 --> 01:30:50,300
Are you all right?

772
01:30:53,100 --> 01:30:55,100
You know you're a nag?

773
01:30:57,400 --> 01:30:58,900
A very pretty one, but a nag.

774
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:16,400
What was that for?

775
01:31:16,700 --> 01:31:18,000
Just thanks.

776
01:31:20,300 --> 01:31:21,300
You're welcome.

777
01:31:25,300 --> 01:31:27,600
I'll get some salt for the eggs.

778
01:31:27,800 --> 01:31:28,900
Forget the salt.

779
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:34,400
Please...

780
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:36,300
Please don't.

781
01:31:37,700 --> 01:31:39,500
Well, I guess...

782
01:31:40,300 --> 01:31:42,800
...I guess my life isn't worth two kisses.

783
01:31:52,900 --> 01:31:54,400
Please...

784
01:31:55,800 --> 01:31:57,200
I'm sorry.

785
01:32:08,500 --> 01:32:10,500
What's the matter?

786
01:32:16,900 --> 01:32:19,500
I was married back in Denver.

787
01:32:21,700 --> 01:32:23,100
His name was Paul.

788
01:32:23,400 --> 01:32:26,200
He was a doctor, and a very fine man.

789
01:32:27,900 --> 01:32:30,400
He used to say this was his place...

790
01:32:31,500 --> 01:32:33,500
...this was where doctors were needed.

791
01:32:36,800 --> 01:32:39,600
One night, after we'd camped...

792
01:32:40,500 --> 01:32:42,800
...we sat around the fire talking...

793
01:32:43,400 --> 01:32:45,400
...husband and wife talk...

794
01:32:45,600 --> 01:32:49,000
...about how many children
we were going to have and...

795
01:32:50,200 --> 01:32:53,100
...what a wonderful life
we were going to have together.

796
01:32:58,300 --> 01:32:59,700
And then they came...

797
01:33:02,400 --> 01:33:04,400
...two men on horseback.

798
01:33:05,600 --> 01:33:07,200
Just some food...

799
01:33:08,700 --> 01:33:12,100
...just to share our food,
that's all they wanted.

800
01:33:14,400 --> 01:33:15,800
Then one of them...

801
01:33:17,900 --> 01:33:19,600
...put his hand on me...

802
01:33:22,900 --> 01:33:25,000
...and there was a shot...

803
01:33:26,400 --> 01:33:28,000
...and Paul was dead.

804
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:34,800
And they just left him there
lying beside me on the ground, dead.

805
01:33:38,900 --> 01:33:41,400
And they took me...

806
01:33:44,500 --> 01:33:46,600
...and took me, and took me...

807
01:34:07,700 --> 01:34:09,500
The tumbleweed wagon...

808
01:34:10,600 --> 01:34:11,900
...the jail...

809
01:34:12,400 --> 01:34:14,300
...you're looking for those men?

810
01:34:20,700 --> 01:34:23,000
Well, what happens when you find them?

811
01:34:28,300 --> 01:34:30,200
Or if you don't find them?

812
01:34:35,500 --> 01:34:36,800
Ever?

813
01:34:46,900 --> 01:34:49,700
We'd better hurry. It's going to storm.

814
01:38:13,900 --> 01:38:16,700
Miss Rachel, where do you want
to put these blankets?

815
01:38:17,500 --> 01:38:20,000
- What is it, Marv?
- Where do you want these blankets?

816
01:38:20,100 --> 01:38:23,100
- Oh, just put them in the back someplace.
- Yes, ma'am.

817
01:38:33,100 --> 01:38:34,500
Hi, Marshal!

818
01:38:57,300 --> 01:39:00,700
You asked me once
whether I could ever stop looking.

819
01:39:00,600 --> 01:39:02,200
I think now I can.

820
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:04,300
Can you?

821
01:39:05,100 --> 01:39:07,200
Well, Rachel, there's a difference.

822
01:39:07,900 --> 01:39:10,600
You see, I'm not...
I'm not looking for ghosts.

823
01:39:11,300 --> 01:39:13,600
The end of my trail's in Red Creek.

824
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:15,400
Maybe not.

825
01:39:16,400 --> 01:39:17,500
What then?

826
01:39:19,500 --> 01:39:20,500
I don't know.

827
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:04,300
I think we got him.

828
01:41:04,900 --> 01:41:06,200
I don't know.

829
01:41:06,900 --> 01:41:09,400
The dog or the shot, either one.

830
01:41:32,600 --> 01:41:34,400
Why ain't that dog yappin'?

831
01:41:35,700 --> 01:41:38,500
If that Marshal was alive,
that dog would be yappin', wouldn't it?

832
01:41:38,400 --> 01:41:40,200
I told you I didn't know.

833
01:41:44,400 --> 01:41:46,200
But I aim to find out.

834
01:41:50,100 --> 01:41:52,500
No! Let him come to us.

835
01:41:52,600 --> 01:41:55,900
No, Captain.
I've waited on him long enough.

836
01:42:02,700 --> 01:42:04,000
Why don't he move?

837
01:42:32,700 --> 01:42:33,900
Tommy.

838
01:43:35,500 --> 01:43:36,500
Drop it!

839
01:46:50,900 --> 01:46:52,300
Dead.

840
01:46:52,700 --> 01:46:54,200
Captain Wilson...

841
01:46:54,700 --> 01:46:56,600
...Tommy, Loomis...

842
01:46:58,100 --> 01:47:00,200
...all of them dead.

843
01:47:01,700 --> 01:47:03,900
All except Maddow, Blackfoot...

844
01:47:03,900 --> 01:47:05,900
...and you, Jenkins.

845
01:47:07,400 --> 01:47:09,400
Count me dead, too.

846
01:47:12,700 --> 01:47:16,000
I just want to say
that I don't hold you to blame...

847
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:18,600
...for what that's worth.

848
01:47:20,300 --> 01:47:22,100
It's worth somethin'.

849
01:47:38,300 --> 01:47:40,300
So that's how it is, huh?

850
01:47:41,200 --> 01:47:44,700
That Rachel lit a fire in you
with that rich body of hers.

851
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:48,200
You lit a fire in each other.
And now you're going to get married...

852
01:47:48,200 --> 01:47:51,700
...raise cattle and kids,
devil take the rest of the world.

853
01:47:51,800 --> 01:47:52,400
Maybe.

854
01:47:52,500 --> 01:47:55,800
Used the law and a badge
to heal the scar on your neck.

855
01:47:56,700 --> 01:47:59,600
How many men are you gonna
have to hang to heal your scars?

856
01:47:59,700 --> 01:48:00,700
Go to hell, Cooper!

857
01:48:00,800 --> 01:48:05,500
I've already been there, Judge, in your
wagon and in that hole you call a jail.

858
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:07,800
And old man Jenkins is gonna die there.

859
01:48:07,800 --> 01:48:10,100
- Is he sick?
- He's dyin'.

860
01:48:10,300 --> 01:48:12,800
- I'll get a doctor down there for him.
- Let him go.

861
01:48:12,800 --> 01:48:15,100
He can go out and look
for another innocent man to lynch?

862
01:48:15,200 --> 01:48:16,700
He's an old man.

863
01:48:21,300 --> 01:48:24,000
That was an old rope
he helped put around your neck...

864
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:26,700
...but it came damn near
to killing you, didn't it?

865
01:48:27,100 --> 01:48:28,900
What's the matter with you, Cooper?

866
01:48:29,800 --> 01:48:31,600
You got Jenkins on your conscience?

867
01:48:32,500 --> 01:48:34,400
Think I judged him too harshly?

868
01:48:34,400 --> 01:48:37,600
Used him like a piece of kindling
for my fire of justice?

869
01:48:38,200 --> 01:48:41,200
Maybe that's inevitable,
when there's only one man, one court...

870
01:48:41,200 --> 01:48:43,800
...with the power of final justice over a

871
01:48:43,900 --> 01:48:46,900
territory five times
the size of most states.

872
01:48:48,100 --> 01:48:52,100
Mistakes. Oh, I've made them, Cooper.
Don't you doubt it.

873
01:48:52,200 --> 01:48:54,300
Don't you doubt either,
there are times sittin' up there...

874
01:48:54,300 --> 01:48:57,100
...in that judgment seat,
I've wished, I have prayed...

875
01:48:57,200 --> 01:49:01,100
...that there was someone standing
between me and God Almighty!

876
01:49:01,900 --> 01:49:04,400
Someone with power to say,
"You're wrong, Fenton.

877
01:49:04,500 --> 01:49:08,400
"You've made a mistake in law,
and this man here deserves another trial...

878
01:49:08,400 --> 01:49:11,200
"...this man here a reprieve,
and this man is innocent!"

879
01:49:15,200 --> 01:49:17,800
But until this territory
becomes a state...

880
01:49:18,200 --> 01:49:21,400
...with a governor,
and a state court of appeals...

881
01:49:21,500 --> 01:49:24,600
...I'm the law here, all the law...

882
01:49:25,300 --> 01:49:29,100
...and if you don't like that,
you can cuss me till hell freezes over.

883
01:49:29,500 --> 01:49:31,500
Or you can join me, Cooper.

884
01:49:32,100 --> 01:49:33,800
Even fight me...

885
01:49:34,200 --> 01:49:37,100
...help me turn this godforsaken
territory into a state...

886
01:49:37,100 --> 01:49:39,500
...where no one man calls himself the law.

887
01:49:39,900 --> 01:49:41,900
I want that old man pardoned.

888
01:49:42,400 --> 01:49:43,800
You pick up your badge.

889
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:45,700
Tonight, right now!

890
01:49:53,200 --> 01:49:57,400
Take this down, give it
to one of the guards down there.

891
01:49:57,700 --> 01:50:00,400
If there are any questions,
let him see me.

892
01:50:00,700 --> 01:50:02,700
There'll be no questions.

893
01:50:26,200 --> 01:50:27,600
Cooper.

894
01:50:27,900 --> 01:50:30,800
Charley Blackfoot was seen
in the town of Ridgeway.

895
01:50:31,100 --> 01:50:33,700
I got two unfilled warrants here...

896
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:36,800
...Blackfoot and Maddow,
the law still wants them.
