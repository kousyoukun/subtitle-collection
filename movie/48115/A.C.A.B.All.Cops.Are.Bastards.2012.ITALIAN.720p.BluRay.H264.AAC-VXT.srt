1
00:00:52,541 --> 00:01:00,415
Riot police, sons-of-bitches...

2
00:01:05,208 --> 00:01:08,790
Riot police, sons-of-bitches!

3
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:53,374
You sleeping here or coming home?

4
00:02:23,625 --> 00:02:26,582
- Whatcha got?
- Good shit.

5
00:02:26,666 --> 00:02:29,040
- One gram, 10 euros.
- One.

6
00:02:29,708 --> 00:02:31,415
Wait for me here.

7
00:02:58,583 --> 00:03:00,999
Didn't you see me?

8
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:30,999
Hey, fuckin' Fascist,
can't fight alone?

9
00:03:32,375 --> 00:03:34,082
Get in the car.

10
00:03:34,916 --> 00:03:36,624
Get in the car!

11
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:44,165
You guys feeling tough?

12
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:47,915
Bring it on!

13
00:04:05,166 --> 00:04:08,249
Listen, I'll tell you just once.

14
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:13,499
Never come here again pushing
this shit around families and kids.

15
00:04:16,375 --> 00:04:18,790
- Carolina!
- Daddy!

16
00:05:02,208 --> 00:05:04,290
Don't move.

17
00:05:09,625 --> 00:05:12,249
What is it?

18
00:05:12,916 --> 00:05:16,582
What the fuck are you sayin'?
Shut up.

19
00:05:25,208 --> 00:05:27,124
How much did you fuckin' drink?

20
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:37,790
Let us through, it's our right.

21
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:52,499
It's our right to go to Rome!

22
00:07:52,583 --> 00:07:54,457
Get back!

23
00:07:59,833 --> 00:08:04,707
Close ranks!
You have to stay back.

24
00:08:30,833 --> 00:08:33,582
Hey, cut the spittin'!

25
00:08:34,833 --> 00:08:36,415
You piece of shit!

26
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,082
Open!

27
00:09:08,583 --> 00:09:11,040
That's Carletto's seat.

28
00:09:12,708 --> 00:09:15,290
And that's his twin's.

29
00:09:20,375 --> 00:09:22,707
When Carletto gets here,
I'll get up.

30
00:09:25,333 --> 00:09:27,374
Nice goin', rookie!
First day on the job,

31
00:09:27,458 --> 00:09:32,332
- you cracked two workers' heads,
how do you feel? - Great.

32
00:10:24,875 --> 00:10:27,249
- Hey, bro'.
- Hey, guys.

33
00:10:27,333 --> 00:10:29,957
- Wanna hit?
- No, thanks.

34
00:10:32,625 --> 00:10:34,582
What's up with him?

35
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,207
Hi, Mom.

36
00:10:57,666 --> 00:11:01,040
Couldn't you get assigned
to another unit?

37
00:11:01,125 --> 00:11:03,915
It pays best.

38
00:11:28,416 --> 00:11:31,207
What the fuck's this?
What do they want?

39
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:33,790
To put us out on the street
like they promised.

40
00:11:33,875 --> 00:11:38,665
But they forgot the other promise:
to give you your own place.

41
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:53,290
..at the port, heading for Rome,
they were stopped by the police.

42
00:11:53,375 --> 00:11:56,999
The demonstrators
are asking for urgent measures...

43
00:11:57,083 --> 00:12:01,665
- Your Unit is getting more popular
everyday. - Get off it, Maria.

44
00:12:19,041 --> 00:12:20,749
Where's he going?

45
00:12:22,291 --> 00:12:25,832
We said no going out for a month.

46
00:12:26,583 --> 00:12:29,040
You try telling him.

47
00:12:29,125 --> 00:12:32,832
He ended up at headquarters for
brawling, he can't do what he wants.

48
00:12:32,916 --> 00:12:35,790
He doesn't listen to me.

49
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:41,290
Look, be around the house more,

50
00:12:41,375 --> 00:12:43,624
maybe you can get it in his head.

51
00:12:48,125 --> 00:12:51,540
Okay.
I'll go shower.

52
00:13:08,666 --> 00:13:11,374
Stop, you'll wake the building.

53
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:14,249
- What's this mean?
- Didn't you get the letter?

54
00:13:14,333 --> 00:13:17,290
- I want a separation.
- Miriam,

55
00:13:17,375 --> 00:13:21,124
this is my house, hear me?
And Carolina's my daughter!

56
00:13:21,208 --> 00:13:24,874
- If you love her, be more careful.
- What do you mean?

57
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:27,582
- That supermarket thing.
- That again?

58
00:13:27,666 --> 00:13:31,665
Which adds to the crap
you've always given her and me.

59
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:35,832
Don't make me repeat it,
open this fucking door, let me in.

60
00:13:35,916 --> 00:13:38,499
Open this door!

61
00:13:39,833 --> 00:13:43,124
- Carolina!
- Say hi to Daddy.

62
00:13:43,208 --> 00:13:46,457
- Daddy's little girl, hi.
- He's sleeping elsewhere...

63
00:15:43,708 --> 00:15:47,915
I was in the south curve,
but I had better tickets.

64
00:15:49,166 --> 00:15:53,040
At a certain point, I see an opening
between the barriers and I say:

65
00:15:53,125 --> 00:15:56,499
"I'll go through there", but
as soon as I do a riot cop comes,

66
00:15:56,583 --> 00:15:58,999
he grabs me, says I can't be there.

67
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:03,249
- He grabs you?
- Yes. He yanks my arm hard,

68
00:16:04,083 --> 00:16:06,582
- almost broke it.
- And what did you do?

69
00:16:07,208 --> 00:16:10,499
I try to explain I have a ticket

70
00:16:10,583 --> 00:16:13,040
and that he's hurting me,

71
00:16:13,125 --> 00:16:15,249
but he doesn't even let me finish,

72
00:16:15,333 --> 00:16:17,457
first he yells to shut up,

73
00:16:17,541 --> 00:16:19,999
then he hits me in the mouth
with his helmet,

74
00:16:21,458 --> 00:16:23,749
and this is the result.

75
00:16:28,125 --> 00:16:31,624
- Is the officer who hit you here?
- Yeah.

76
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:33,957
Could you point him out?

77
00:16:37,041 --> 00:16:39,165
He's sitting there.

78
00:16:42,916 --> 00:16:46,332
I remind the court the defendant
is not new to this,

79
00:16:46,416 --> 00:16:50,707
he has more than five suits pending
for aggravated assault.

80
00:16:50,791 --> 00:16:54,790
Maybe it's about time
you dampened your exuberance.

81
00:17:41,625 --> 00:17:45,040
Mazinga, you not only suck,
you're deaf too!

82
00:17:45,125 --> 00:17:48,499
- Didn't you hear me?
- Only one guy deaf here.

83
00:17:48,583 --> 00:17:50,874
I might be deaf, but I see good.

84
00:17:50,958 --> 00:17:54,915
- Then see about fuckin' off.
- Yes sir, Chief, sir!

85
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,415
You look like my Grampa
with that body! Look here.

86
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:02,374
- Know what makes us different?
- 300 grams of brain, Carletto.

87
00:18:02,458 --> 00:18:06,332
Zone diet, a balance of carbs,
fats and protein,

88
00:18:06,416 --> 00:18:09,124
40-30-30.

89
00:18:09,333 --> 00:18:13,082
You trim down like a sonofabitch
and fat disappears.

90
00:18:13,166 --> 00:18:15,499
That's where
your grams of brain went!

91
00:18:15,583 --> 00:18:19,290
Laugh, Nero, but I'm in the Zone.

92
00:18:19,375 --> 00:18:23,790
Good, then take my advice:
stay there.

93
00:18:33,833 --> 00:18:37,665
What's wrong,
you worried about the hearing?

94
00:18:38,458 --> 00:18:40,165
I'm pissed off.

95
00:18:41,375 --> 00:18:43,832
Me and Nero
are witnesses, you know.

96
00:18:43,916 --> 00:18:48,624
Three cops against a poor
sports fan. Not enough of us.

97
00:18:48,708 --> 00:18:50,999
Not many but the right ones.

98
00:18:56,958 --> 00:19:00,082
What's going on, huh?
I have two kids!

99
00:19:12,291 --> 00:19:15,832
Is this any way
to put people out on the street?

100
00:19:18,625 --> 00:19:22,249
Hey, no answer? I'm not invisible!

101
00:19:22,958 --> 00:19:26,665
- You have to leave here.
- I'm not budging.

102
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:31,082
See to this, I'm going upstairs.

103
00:19:35,375 --> 00:19:37,332
You heard him? You have to leave.

104
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:41,124
- It's useless telling me.
- Sir, please!

105
00:19:41,208 --> 00:19:45,290
You can plead to the Virgin Mary,
I'm staying in my home.

106
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:50,457
- It's not your home.
- Yes, it is,

107
00:19:50,541 --> 00:19:53,415
all my things are here,
so it's mine.

108
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:57,624
- Get up!
- Let go of him!

109
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:01,415
Right now.

110
00:20:12,416 --> 00:20:15,040
That stuff's mine.

111
00:20:18,125 --> 00:20:20,415
What are you doing?
It's my stuff!

112
00:20:23,541 --> 00:20:27,332
Since it's down on the ground now,
your home is down there.

113
00:20:35,125 --> 00:20:36,832
Rookie!

114
00:20:38,041 --> 00:20:40,207
I mean you, what's your name?

115
00:20:41,541 --> 00:20:45,624
- You must have a name.
- Costantini Adriano.

116
00:20:45,708 --> 00:20:49,082
You won't get the job done
by attacking people.

117
00:20:49,166 --> 00:20:52,374
Does kicking people out
seem like a job?

118
00:20:52,458 --> 00:20:54,582
City Hall is kicking them out,

119
00:20:54,666 --> 00:20:57,874
it's our job to limit damages,
you almost did some!

120
00:20:59,125 --> 00:21:02,165
If you attack one, a revolt
breaks out and 100 get hurt.

121
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:05,249
Destroy him psychologically,
that way you resolve the problem

122
00:21:05,333 --> 00:21:10,207
and no one gets hurt. Just use this,
with this, you'll get results.

123
00:21:10,291 --> 00:21:13,874
Nice words. Can I go?

124
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:20,540
- Am I dismissed, Sir?
- Go, go.

125
00:21:31,916 --> 00:21:35,665
He doesn't want to learn,
let it go.

126
00:21:37,041 --> 00:21:39,207
Can't.

127
00:22:00,666 --> 00:22:04,624
- Your mother's house?
- It's still occupied.

128
00:22:06,208 --> 00:22:09,415
You got a job?
You're not around anymore.

129
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:16,707
Adriano Costantini, Mr. tough guy?

130
00:22:19,791 --> 00:22:23,582
- Adriano Costantini, that's all.
- I say Mr. tough guy.

131
00:22:23,666 --> 00:22:26,082
- And if I don't like it?
- Your problem.

132
00:22:26,166 --> 00:22:30,207
- Who the fuck's this?
- Relax, Gabriele, it's okay.

133
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,249
- Sure?
- Sure.

134
00:22:39,666 --> 00:22:42,374
- See you around.
- Bye.

135
00:22:46,208 --> 00:22:48,332
Why are you here?

136
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:54,374
- What do you want?
- I'm here to do you a favor.

137
00:22:54,458 --> 00:22:59,415
- Meaning? - You work on a team,
you have to fraternize.

138
00:23:04,791 --> 00:23:07,832
- Fraternize.
- With the older ones.

139
00:23:07,916 --> 00:23:12,499
Don't worry, you'll be back
before midnight... Cinderella.

140
00:23:24,916 --> 00:23:27,707
This is Carletto.

141
00:23:28,916 --> 00:23:31,290
Anything you wanna say to him?

142
00:23:32,583 --> 00:23:34,749
You know where we're going?

143
00:23:45,208 --> 00:23:47,957
Me and him
have nothing more to say.

144
00:24:07,458 --> 00:24:11,999
- Open up.
- I thought I'd forgotten something.

145
00:24:16,416 --> 00:24:20,332
- That'll teach you to be
a tough guy. - You bastards!

146
00:24:21,250 --> 00:24:23,290
Open up!

147
00:24:25,583 --> 00:24:29,707
- Have a beer.
- That gives you a pot belly.

148
00:24:29,791 --> 00:24:31,874
- Drink it.
- You nuts?

149
00:24:31,958 --> 00:24:35,165
Then I have to eat half a kilo
of broccoli and string beans.

150
00:24:36,541 --> 00:24:38,707
I told you, 40-30-30.

151
00:24:38,791 --> 00:24:41,374
- I hear you, drink the beer.
- No, you don't understand.

152
00:24:43,458 --> 00:24:47,540
- I'm good like this.
- I see that. Yeah, really.

153
00:24:50,416 --> 00:24:52,915
Why the silence?

154
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:59,707
Adriano-Costantini-that's-all,
do you hear me?

155
00:25:04,708 --> 00:25:06,624
- Open it.
- Wait a minute.

156
00:25:06,708 --> 00:25:10,540
- What if he's suffocating?
- He's acting.

157
00:25:31,416 --> 00:25:33,790
Relax.

158
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:42,582
You call this fraternizing?

159
00:25:42,666 --> 00:25:46,540
- We wanted to see how you think.
- Another sermon?

160
00:25:46,625 --> 00:25:49,832
You're no street kid now,
you're a riot cop,

161
00:25:49,916 --> 00:25:53,874
- you wear a uniform. - A riot cop
always obeys his commander.

162
00:25:53,958 --> 00:25:57,499
They said that times
at the Academy.

163
00:25:57,583 --> 00:26:00,749
You don't fucking get it,
he's not your commander,

164
00:26:00,833 --> 00:26:04,790
he's your brother,
he teaches you to live.

165
00:26:04,875 --> 00:26:08,415
You're wrong, I'm an only child.

166
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:11,165
Cut the crap, kid.

167
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:17,499
A riot cop's worthless alone.
He makes sense only in a team.

168
00:26:17,583 --> 00:26:20,040
You're part of a team,
or you're nothing.

169
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:27,124
Now you're part of the team.

170
00:26:32,291 --> 00:26:33,999
Good, I want you pissed off

171
00:26:34,083 --> 00:26:38,249
for the stadium on Sunday.

172
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,707
We're counting on you.

173
00:26:54,833 --> 00:26:59,374
Now who'll fuckin' drive?
Not me.

174
00:27:03,083 --> 00:27:09,290
Riot police, sons-of-bitches...

175
00:27:47,166 --> 00:27:50,457
Don't look down,
stare at them in their eyes.

176
00:31:25,625 --> 00:31:27,582
It's nothing serious.

177
00:31:28,708 --> 00:31:30,957
Hear me? It's nothing serious.

178
00:32:39,875 --> 00:32:43,124
Get your hands off me!

179
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:59,540
On your feet.

180
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,415
Open your jacket.

181
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:10,207
Nothing.

182
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:14,207
Come on!

183
00:33:17,791 --> 00:33:19,749
Your jacket.

184
00:33:22,958 --> 00:33:24,665
Sit down.

185
00:33:25,083 --> 00:33:28,082
- You, stand up.
- No.

186
00:33:28,916 --> 00:33:32,582
You have a badge
and I have a ticket.

187
00:33:40,083 --> 00:33:42,499
- Stand up.
- I said no.

188
00:33:45,625 --> 00:33:49,999
Put the club down,
leave him alone!

189
00:33:57,041 --> 00:33:59,457
You shit, you're hurting him!

190
00:34:01,208 --> 00:34:03,457
What the fuck are you doing?

191
00:34:03,541 --> 00:34:05,832
- He wanted to take my club.
- Piece of shit!

192
00:34:05,916 --> 00:34:09,374
Shut up or it's my turn.
Wait outside.

193
00:34:10,541 --> 00:34:17,332
Shut up. Open your jacket,
take the scarf off and shut up.

194
00:34:17,416 --> 00:34:20,040
Let me see you, do I know you?
Got a record?

195
00:34:20,125 --> 00:34:22,999
- No record.
- Hand over your I.D.

196
00:34:30,291 --> 00:34:31,540
Listen to me.

197
00:34:31,625 --> 00:34:36,124
That guy took your club
and bashed you in the face.

198
00:34:36,208 --> 00:34:39,415
In getting it back,
you exchanged a blow or two.

199
00:34:39,916 --> 00:34:43,374
Nero and me will say
we couldn't get there in time,

200
00:34:43,458 --> 00:34:44,790
end of story.

201
00:34:44,875 --> 00:34:47,540
I have to say some bullshit?

202
00:34:54,541 --> 00:34:56,707
Now it's not bullshit.

203
00:34:59,333 --> 00:35:01,790
A draft can kill you...

204
00:35:01,875 --> 00:35:05,582
What the fuck do you want?
Sit down.

205
00:35:08,125 --> 00:35:09,832
Shit.

206
00:35:13,458 --> 00:35:16,082
You found out who gave me
this gift?

207
00:35:16,166 --> 00:35:20,499
It wasn't the Neapolitans,
we didn't find a thing.

208
00:35:20,583 --> 00:35:22,124
What's the difference?

209
00:35:22,208 --> 00:35:25,540
He was knifed.

210
00:35:25,625 --> 00:35:27,707
Good evening.

211
00:35:27,791 --> 00:35:31,374
We managed to stitch up the
ligament, with the right therapy

212
00:35:31,458 --> 00:35:34,124
you'll walk without a limp.

213
00:35:34,208 --> 00:35:36,290
But can I go back to work?

214
00:35:36,375 --> 00:35:39,499
I don't know yet,
it was a serious lesion,

215
00:35:39,583 --> 00:35:42,499
- you'll need patience.
- Just what I don't have.

216
00:35:42,583 --> 00:35:47,165
- Try to find some.
- Goodbye.

217
00:35:50,541 --> 00:35:53,415
Think about getting better,
not work.

218
00:35:59,208 --> 00:36:01,082
She's right.

219
00:36:03,916 --> 00:36:05,624
Think about getting better.

220
00:36:06,333 --> 00:36:09,832
I'll find those guys,
it's a promise,

221
00:36:09,916 --> 00:36:12,790
we'll take care of them together.

222
00:36:20,375 --> 00:36:23,290
Bye, Mazinga.

223
00:36:29,666 --> 00:36:32,415
Think I didn't hear your friend?

224
00:36:36,875 --> 00:36:38,582
Giancarlo?

225
00:36:40,583 --> 00:36:42,499
It's turned off.

226
00:36:43,541 --> 00:36:51,207
Hi, Elisa. Listen, make sure parents
park in the right areas, not...

227
00:36:51,291 --> 00:36:54,790
- On the walkway, I know.
- Then do it, or cars can't move.

228
00:36:54,875 --> 00:36:58,165
- This isn't a public school.
- Okay, Professor.

229
00:36:58,250 --> 00:37:00,207
It's important.

230
00:37:04,958 --> 00:37:08,124
- Professor of what?
- Who knows, what's the difference?

231
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,665
- You have a shitty job.
- Look who's talking.

232
00:37:17,750 --> 00:37:21,499
What are you doing?
That's a mini-block of fats.

233
00:37:23,458 --> 00:37:25,457
Open for the lady.

234
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:31,290
Forget it, on your salary
you couldn't even pay for her gas.

235
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,999
Know what tuition is
for this school?

236
00:37:37,625 --> 00:37:42,374
What's the matter, does it piss you
off to be caged up in here?

237
00:37:43,625 --> 00:37:47,457
Shouldn't it?
Is this what we wanted as kids?

238
00:37:48,708 --> 00:37:50,707
I just wanted to see
the Roma Team.

239
00:37:50,791 --> 00:37:54,124
Well, now you get in free
at the stadium.

240
00:37:59,166 --> 00:38:03,249
- How's Mazinga?
- A bum deal.

241
00:38:05,708 --> 00:38:08,749
Does your cousin still
hang around with hooligans?

242
00:38:08,833 --> 00:38:12,749
- My cousin's a jerk.
- That's why I asked you.

243
00:38:17,625 --> 00:38:19,332
Okay.

244
00:38:20,541 --> 00:38:23,165
I'll see if he knows anything.

245
00:38:27,458 --> 00:38:31,124
She's kicking me out
and thinks she's right?

246
00:38:31,208 --> 00:38:35,165
Counselor, I'm not signing anything.
Nothing.

247
00:38:35,250 --> 00:38:39,082
Just think,
those guys are colleagues too.

248
00:38:39,166 --> 00:38:42,332
I wish they'd drop
by the Unit someday...

249
00:38:45,041 --> 00:38:48,457
Costantini, what's the difference
between you and them?

250
00:38:48,541 --> 00:38:52,415
- The leash?
- Stop playing tough guy.

251
00:38:58,833 --> 00:39:00,749
Why are you a cop?

252
00:39:04,250 --> 00:39:06,832
And why exactly a riot cop?

253
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:14,124
You don't even know that?

254
00:39:19,291 --> 00:39:22,332
Turn your brain on,
so you can answer me.

255
00:39:42,625 --> 00:39:45,374
Get your hands out of your pockets,
stand straight, if you can.

256
00:39:45,458 --> 00:39:47,790
Put your beret on.

257
00:39:47,875 --> 00:39:51,457
If you don't respect the uniform,
how can others?

258
00:39:52,375 --> 00:39:55,582
So?
What's his cousin say?

259
00:39:56,250 --> 00:39:59,665
It was Romans hiding as Neapolitans,

260
00:39:59,750 --> 00:40:02,915
they're the ones who did this
to you.

261
00:40:03,708 --> 00:40:05,874
Now I just have to find them.

262
00:40:06,416 --> 00:40:08,915
And when you do?

263
00:40:09,375 --> 00:40:11,332
What do you mean?

264
00:40:15,208 --> 00:40:19,207
If you're worried about your leg,
it'll get back to normal.

265
00:40:20,291 --> 00:40:24,415
How do you know that?
You're a fucking cop,

266
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:26,207
not a doctor.

267
00:40:27,333 --> 00:40:30,457
Your leg hurts? I'm sorry.

268
00:40:30,541 --> 00:40:33,540
But these things pass,

269
00:40:33,625 --> 00:40:36,749
what doesn't is who we are.

270
00:40:59,250 --> 00:41:02,499
Get better fast, damn you.

271
00:41:06,250 --> 00:41:08,874
Joint custody of your daughter,

272
00:41:08,958 --> 00:41:12,999
500 euros a month in alimony

273
00:41:13,083 --> 00:41:17,457
and the house goes to your wife.
Any questions?

274
00:41:20,125 --> 00:41:23,374
If there's nothing else,
you can sign.

275
00:42:11,791 --> 00:42:16,207
- Please, don't send us away.
- Get up.

276
00:42:16,291 --> 00:42:19,040
Don't send us away! Please!

277
00:42:19,833 --> 00:42:26,499
- I'll do whatever you want.
- You have to get up.

278
00:42:26,583 --> 00:42:30,499
- I'll do whatever you want!
- Knock it off.

279
00:42:40,041 --> 00:42:42,874
Now you've pissed me off.

280
00:42:43,875 --> 00:42:48,915
Tone it down.
Our problems stay at home.

281
00:42:54,625 --> 00:42:58,874
Are you all right?
It was nothing.

282
00:42:58,958 --> 00:43:01,124
Please, get up.

283
00:43:01,416 --> 00:43:04,665
We're following the vote-count
of the second local elections ballot

284
00:43:04,750 --> 00:43:08,457
in this long spring of elections

285
00:43:08,541 --> 00:43:10,874
with some important differences...

286
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,624
Hello.

287
00:43:13,708 --> 00:43:16,457
- I'm here to meet Enrico Mancini.
- He's in his office.

288
00:43:16,541 --> 00:43:19,415
Adriano! Come here.

289
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:24,249
- How are you?
- Fine, you?

290
00:43:24,708 --> 00:43:27,540
Sorry for the mess, the election
campaign's in full swing.

291
00:43:28,750 --> 00:43:31,874
You disappeared.

292
00:43:31,958 --> 00:43:35,165
The party still needs guys
like you.

293
00:43:35,708 --> 00:43:38,915
I'm with the police now, riot unit.

294
00:43:40,583 --> 00:43:42,874
Really? How come?

295
00:43:45,416 --> 00:43:49,665
But it suits you,
you always had a mean punch!

296
00:43:50,541 --> 00:43:52,915
Why did you want to see me?

297
00:43:53,708 --> 00:43:57,124
The city wants to kick
my mother out,

298
00:43:57,208 --> 00:44:01,207
they're throwing her out on the
street, she has nowhere to go.

299
00:44:01,291 --> 00:44:04,040
I mean, she has a place,

300
00:44:04,916 --> 00:44:07,124
they assigned her welfare housing,

301
00:44:07,208 --> 00:44:11,124
but it's occupied by illegals.

302
00:44:11,208 --> 00:44:13,915
When will our mayor
ever kick them out?

303
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,040
Pretty soon they'll be giving them
the right to vote.

304
00:44:16,125 --> 00:44:20,790
That's why I called you, maybe...
You could give me a hand.

305
00:44:20,875 --> 00:44:22,582
A hand?

306
00:44:23,166 --> 00:44:25,790
You're not asking a favor,

307
00:44:25,875 --> 00:44:27,749
you're demanding a right,

308
00:44:27,833 --> 00:44:31,290
your mother's right
to her own home.

309
00:44:31,375 --> 00:44:35,124
The wind's changing, people
are tired, they want security,

310
00:44:35,208 --> 00:44:38,415
they want to take back
the motherland.

311
00:44:38,625 --> 00:44:41,165
We'll win this time
and with the new mayor

312
00:44:41,250 --> 00:44:43,415
you won't have to ask any favors.

313
00:44:51,166 --> 00:44:54,957
I spoke to Santini,
head of personnel.

314
00:44:55,041 --> 00:44:58,749
I don't even know
if I'll get my leg back, Maria!

315
00:44:59,791 --> 00:45:01,790
Want to keep doing riot control?

316
00:45:01,875 --> 00:45:05,624
I'm a riot cop, are you ashamed?
You're a cop yourself.

317
00:45:05,708 --> 00:45:08,624
Right, you don't have to be
on the street

318
00:45:08,708 --> 00:45:11,665
- to be a good cop.
- And where should I be,

319
00:45:11,750 --> 00:45:15,790
- warming some chair in an office?
- I might be warming a chair,

320
00:45:15,875 --> 00:45:19,332
- but at least I'm trying to raise
my son. - Meaning?

321
00:45:19,416 --> 00:45:21,749
You don't even see he's not around.

322
00:45:21,833 --> 00:45:26,374
That's new? He hasn't come once
since I got here.

323
00:45:26,458 --> 00:45:29,165
For days now, he hasn't
even come by the house.

324
00:45:29,916 --> 00:45:34,290
- What do you mean? Where does
he sleep? - I don't know.

325
00:46:03,708 --> 00:46:05,915
HATED AND PROUD

326
00:46:07,958 --> 00:46:11,540
STOP WITH IMMIGRANTS
ITALY FOR ITALIANS

327
00:46:44,708 --> 00:46:47,832
Recreation's over,
we're going home.

328
00:46:50,291 --> 00:46:52,790
Tomorrow you even go back
to school.

329
00:46:54,041 --> 00:46:57,124
Take your hands off.

330
00:46:57,208 --> 00:47:00,624
- Who the fuck are you?
- Who are you?

331
00:47:00,708 --> 00:47:04,624
He's a riot cop.

332
00:47:04,708 --> 00:47:08,832
- One that beats up guys at the
game? - I can beat you up here too.

333
00:47:08,916 --> 00:47:11,040
Okay!

334
00:47:11,750 --> 00:47:16,207
Get out, this is our house,
cops aren't welcome.

335
00:47:16,291 --> 00:47:20,832
- Don't you like my face? - I don't
like servants, guys like you,

336
00:47:20,916 --> 00:47:25,249
instead of defending Italians,
you fight kids at the stadium.

337
00:47:25,333 --> 00:47:27,999
So you defend Italians?

338
00:47:28,083 --> 00:47:31,207
A bunch of skinheads
screeching like monkeys?

339
00:47:31,291 --> 00:47:33,290
No, I'm doing your job,

340
00:47:33,375 --> 00:47:35,582
making sure this doesn't become
a mosque.

341
00:47:35,666 --> 00:47:38,999
This is our house,
and if you're not Italian,

342
00:47:39,083 --> 00:47:41,582
you'd better go back home.

343
00:47:41,666 --> 00:47:45,290
You convinced me,
in fact, we're going home.

344
00:47:49,833 --> 00:47:52,082
I'm staying here.

345
00:47:52,958 --> 00:47:54,457
Hear that?

346
00:47:54,541 --> 00:47:58,290
Now get out,
this is no place for you.

347
00:48:09,416 --> 00:48:13,457
Servant!

348
00:48:24,708 --> 00:48:28,624
- Yo, Cobra. - They still haven't
kicked you out of the country?

349
00:48:28,708 --> 00:48:31,790
They don't make assholes
like me anymore.

350
00:48:32,791 --> 00:48:36,707
- And him? - Filling in for Mazinga
for a few days.

351
00:48:36,791 --> 00:48:39,290
- Adriano, this is Mustafà.
- Pleasure.

352
00:48:39,375 --> 00:48:43,457
He's kinda dark, but...
he's a brother too.

353
00:48:43,708 --> 00:48:45,415
Know the rules?

354
00:48:45,541 --> 00:48:49,332
Never say I'm a cop,
because moonlighting's illegal,

355
00:48:49,416 --> 00:48:51,915
and if I see anything strange,
I tell Cobra.

356
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,707
No commotion.

357
00:48:55,083 --> 00:48:57,540
Don't worry, he's a good kid.

358
00:49:23,291 --> 00:49:25,040
I'll bring her back for dinner.

359
00:49:26,416 --> 00:49:28,124
Be good.

360
00:49:46,708 --> 00:49:49,707
- You're sure you wanted ice cream?
- Yes.

361
00:49:50,625 --> 00:49:54,832
- Then why not eat it?
- I'm waiting for Mommy.

362
00:50:03,791 --> 00:50:06,915
I think you're bored.

363
00:50:08,458 --> 00:50:10,999
- You're bored, right?
- A little.

364
00:50:17,416 --> 00:50:21,124
Carolina,
want to see where Daddy works?

365
00:50:21,208 --> 00:50:22,915
Yes.

366
00:50:23,416 --> 00:50:25,124
Want to?

367
00:50:25,708 --> 00:50:27,415
You do?

368
00:50:36,791 --> 00:50:38,957
Hey, friend!

369
00:50:39,041 --> 00:50:40,999
- Give one cigarette?
- I don't smoke.

370
00:50:41,083 --> 00:50:44,457
Then give money to buy
one cigarette.

371
00:50:44,541 --> 00:50:48,665
Give some money,
some coins to buy one cigarette.

372
00:50:48,750 --> 00:50:51,332
Give me some money?

373
00:50:52,583 --> 00:50:56,290
Are you deaf?
Besides being a nigger?

374
00:50:59,166 --> 00:51:02,374
Nigger, give me money
to buy cigarette.

375
00:51:02,916 --> 00:51:06,665
Go home, no? A few coins!

376
00:51:08,208 --> 00:51:10,749
Coins to buy cigarette.

377
00:51:13,541 --> 00:51:18,290
Come on, nigger, some coins,
to buy cigarette and go away.

378
00:51:31,416 --> 00:51:33,624
Thank you, nigger.

379
00:51:43,333 --> 00:51:46,207
Cobra did this, Daddy's friend,
remember him?

380
00:51:46,833 --> 00:51:48,915
He's good at drawing, isn't he?

381
00:51:50,625 --> 00:51:53,582
When Daddy goes to work,
he dresses like that.

382
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,999
What is it? I can't now.

383
00:52:01,416 --> 00:52:04,749
I have Carolina, how can l?

384
00:52:05,625 --> 00:52:08,290
Okay, on my way.

385
00:52:08,375 --> 00:52:10,582
Sicilian,

386
00:52:12,833 --> 00:52:15,999
are you good with kids?
I'll leave her with you for an hour.

387
00:52:30,958 --> 00:52:34,207
You got better eyesight,
does it say toilet here?

388
00:52:34,291 --> 00:52:38,415
- Don't think so. - Then why's
this asshole pissing here?

389
00:52:38,500 --> 00:52:42,749
- He's talking to you.
- What have you got here?

390
00:52:43,291 --> 00:52:46,624
- If I pissed where your kid plays?
- What the fuck do you want?

391
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:55,582
- Come on, clean up the park.
- Me?

392
00:52:55,666 --> 00:52:59,290
I said to clean the park.

393
00:52:59,375 --> 00:53:02,124
Go on.

394
00:53:08,958 --> 00:53:12,624
Clean up, then fuck off
to your own country.

395
00:53:12,750 --> 00:53:14,499
You missed that.

396
00:53:16,500 --> 00:53:19,874
There's a bottle cap,
don't you see it?

397
00:53:19,958 --> 00:53:21,790
I'm back here tomorrow.

398
00:53:21,875 --> 00:53:23,749
This park's gotta shine!

399
00:53:23,833 --> 00:53:26,749
If you're here, I'll kick your ass,

400
00:53:26,833 --> 00:53:28,499
never come back.

401
00:53:28,583 --> 00:53:31,415
Do I pick this up myself?

402
00:53:33,875 --> 00:53:35,540
Complaining?

403
00:53:41,583 --> 00:53:44,082
They're buying tickets home.

404
00:53:44,166 --> 00:53:47,540
Take back our motherland, fuck 'em!

405
00:53:47,625 --> 00:53:50,332
You kick two out,
a hundred come back.

406
00:53:50,416 --> 00:53:53,457
- Better two than nothing.
- Want to beat them all up?

407
00:53:53,541 --> 00:53:55,499
Yeah, all of them.

408
00:53:56,083 --> 00:53:58,415
When was this picture taken?

409
00:53:58,500 --> 00:54:01,082
About when you started jerking off.

410
00:54:01,583 --> 00:54:05,624
In Genoa, at the G8 summit in 2001 ,
we're from the Seventh.

411
00:54:05,708 --> 00:54:08,624
- Seventh what?
- Seventh Unit.

412
00:54:08,708 --> 00:54:11,707
A team of 70 real men,

413
00:54:12,208 --> 00:54:16,332
brothers who had just one ideal:
clean the shit out of Italy.

414
00:54:16,416 --> 00:54:19,999
- Italy. Not two drunks in a park.
- That again?

415
00:54:20,083 --> 00:54:21,790
Why, isn't it true?

416
00:54:21,875 --> 00:54:24,457
If politicians hadn't screwed us

417
00:54:24,541 --> 00:54:26,749
with that G8 Diaz school
story,

418
00:54:26,833 --> 00:54:28,874
this country would be
different now.

419
00:54:29,833 --> 00:54:33,415
When a drunk Romanian
or a fucking hooligan insults you,

420
00:54:33,500 --> 00:54:36,707
he's insulting the State
and you should arrest him.

421
00:54:36,791 --> 00:54:39,332
Now what do they teach
in the course on public order?

422
00:54:39,416 --> 00:54:42,499
- You have to be attacked
before you can intervene. - Get it?

423
00:54:42,583 --> 00:54:47,082
They teach you to bow your head,
respect the shits.

424
00:54:47,166 --> 00:54:49,874
- That's why I left.
- Why don't you tell the truth?

425
00:54:49,958 --> 00:54:52,624
A rock broke your eardrum
at the Roma-Inter game,

426
00:54:52,708 --> 00:54:56,790
and you cracked two heads
and attacked your superior.

427
00:54:56,875 --> 00:54:59,707
You didn't leave,
they kicked you out.

428
00:55:02,208 --> 00:55:04,749
Diet over?

429
00:55:05,875 --> 00:55:08,915
What really happened
at the Diaz school?

430
00:55:14,125 --> 00:55:17,582
The biggest fuck up of our lives.

431
00:55:21,625 --> 00:55:24,415
It was a massacre.

432
00:55:39,041 --> 00:55:40,832
I'll be right there.

433
00:55:41,625 --> 00:55:43,832
- Fuck!
- What is it?

434
00:55:43,916 --> 00:55:46,207
I left Carolina at the barracks.

435
00:55:51,583 --> 00:55:55,749
What is it?
Still the G8 mess?

436
00:55:56,708 --> 00:55:58,290
No.

437
00:56:04,375 --> 00:56:07,415
I'm sorry you weren't there today.

438
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:10,499
But I don't give a damn, really.

439
00:56:11,041 --> 00:56:13,082
I have other things to think about.

440
00:56:42,958 --> 00:56:44,915
What do you want?

441
00:56:48,291 --> 00:56:51,165
Ever thought about
giving it all up?

442
00:56:51,250 --> 00:56:53,832
Give in? Never.

443
00:56:59,250 --> 00:57:01,332
Tell me something,

444
00:57:02,166 --> 00:57:04,332
how much fun was it today?

445
00:57:05,666 --> 00:57:07,999
How much did you like
cleaning up the park?

446
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,499
- Lots.
- And so?

447
00:57:14,666 --> 00:57:16,665
Would you give it up?

448
00:57:19,166 --> 00:57:21,040
No.

449
00:57:29,208 --> 00:57:31,540
Can I show you something?

450
00:57:44,833 --> 00:57:46,582
That's it...

451
00:57:46,666 --> 00:57:49,832
third floor, where the bike is.

452
00:57:59,250 --> 00:58:01,374
Which one's your mother's?

453
00:58:11,166 --> 00:58:13,540
Where the fuck's he from?

454
00:58:14,583 --> 00:58:16,957
Want to ask him?

455
00:58:30,083 --> 00:58:32,874
- Who is it?
- Is that you, Rami?

456
00:58:32,958 --> 00:58:35,165
Yeah, who is it?

457
00:58:35,250 --> 00:58:37,915
I was just wondering,

458
00:58:39,291 --> 00:58:43,124
with this name, where are you from?

459
00:58:43,208 --> 00:58:44,915
Who are you? What do you want?

460
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:50,290
Be polite, don't answer
a question with a question,

461
00:58:50,375 --> 00:58:53,165
that's how we do it here.
'Cause in your country?

462
00:58:56,041 --> 00:58:59,790
He's talking to his wife,
Ramina's there too.

463
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:04,290
Put your wife on!
Damn you.

464
00:59:11,208 --> 00:59:14,290
If you not stop, I call police.

465
00:59:14,375 --> 00:59:16,874
Here's some bad news.

466
00:59:17,916 --> 00:59:19,624
I am the police.

467
00:59:23,041 --> 00:59:24,749
Where are you from?

468
00:59:27,166 --> 00:59:30,624
- Where are you from?
- Tunisia.

469
00:59:31,458 --> 00:59:36,207
- How long have you been in Italy?
- One year.

470
00:59:36,291 --> 00:59:41,249
Do you work legally?
Have you got a work visa?

471
00:59:42,166 --> 00:59:44,707
- What do you want from me?
- You don't work legally

472
00:59:44,791 --> 00:59:49,415
and you have no visa,
so you can't stay here.

473
00:59:50,166 --> 00:59:51,874
Right?

474
00:59:53,250 --> 00:59:58,165
- Right?
- I not do anything wrong.

475
00:59:58,250 --> 01:00:00,582
Can you stay in Italy or not?

476
01:00:03,208 --> 01:00:04,915
No.

477
01:00:10,250 --> 01:00:13,707
- Are you still there?
- I'm here.

478
01:00:21,583 --> 01:00:25,999
Go back to bed, it's late.
My apologies to your wife.

479
01:00:27,666 --> 01:00:29,499
Let's go,

480
01:00:29,916 --> 01:00:33,832
your politician friend
will get him out, right?

481
01:01:37,666 --> 01:01:39,749
Stealing from your own home?

482
01:01:40,583 --> 01:01:44,874
Go ahead, this stuff's
worthless anyway, right?

483
01:01:44,958 --> 01:01:47,332
Like your father.

484
01:01:47,416 --> 01:01:51,415
You know what I do
day and night to give you a future?

485
01:01:51,500 --> 01:01:56,624
At best I'm being hit
by rocks, spit, insults,

486
01:01:56,708 --> 01:01:58,874
and at worst,
I can even get knifed!

487
01:01:58,958 --> 01:02:04,332
Knock it off! You don't do
this work for me, you like it,

488
01:02:04,416 --> 01:02:08,499
you like playing war,
beating people to death.

489
01:02:08,583 --> 01:02:12,082
Want to beat me? Go ahead, beat me.

490
01:02:14,166 --> 01:02:17,457
Take your rags and get out.

491
01:02:17,541 --> 01:02:20,249
Fuck off, get out.

492
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:44,457
Mr. Sartoni says I broke
his two teeth for no reason,

493
01:02:44,541 --> 01:02:48,249
he was doing nothing,
and someone seems to believe it.

494
01:02:48,333 --> 01:02:51,290
Keep to the facts against you.

495
01:02:53,833 --> 01:02:57,499
Think I like beating people up?

496
01:02:59,750 --> 01:03:02,040
I enjoy it?

497
01:03:03,916 --> 01:03:05,624
You're wrong.

498
01:03:07,166 --> 01:03:09,957
Before deciding
who's innocent and who's guilty

499
01:03:10,041 --> 01:03:14,374
you should at least ask yourself
what the riot unit does.

500
01:03:15,208 --> 01:03:18,290
Every Sunday
we face people like Sartoni,

501
01:03:18,375 --> 01:03:20,832
who, in the best of cases,
spit on you,

502
01:03:20,916 --> 01:03:24,332
but when they're real pissed off,
they throw everything at you.

503
01:03:26,708 --> 01:03:30,082
And a good riot cop
has to stand there, immobile,

504
01:03:30,625 --> 01:03:34,332
protecting himself with his shield.

505
01:03:35,083 --> 01:03:40,290
Then, when the fans get
even more pissed,

506
01:03:40,375 --> 01:03:44,165
then and only then,

507
01:03:45,583 --> 01:03:49,874
if the commanding officer authorizes
us, we can we defend ourselves.

508
01:03:56,541 --> 01:03:59,832
At that point, you're in a battle,

509
01:03:59,916 --> 01:04:04,207
all you can think of
is how to get home alive.

510
01:04:04,291 --> 01:04:07,624
There's just one way to do that,
stay clear-headed.

511
01:04:08,291 --> 01:04:11,540
But in those moments
your heart's pounding,

512
01:04:11,625 --> 01:04:17,207
your adrenaline spikes,
you think your head will explode,

513
01:04:17,291 --> 01:04:19,124
you hear nothing,

514
01:04:20,750 --> 01:04:24,082
you only have your brothers
next to you.

515
01:04:28,750 --> 01:04:33,082
Your brothers
are all you can count on.

516
01:04:49,333 --> 01:04:52,624
That's what happens
at the stadium on Sundays.

517
01:05:27,208 --> 01:05:29,082
An ugly black page
for soccer in Sicily.

518
01:05:29,166 --> 01:05:34,332
It all happened
in the final minutes

519
01:05:34,416 --> 01:05:38,290
of the 40th derby,
Catania-Palermo.

520
01:05:38,375 --> 01:05:43,207
Violent clashes broke out
outside the stadium,

521
01:05:43,291 --> 01:05:47,790
clashes which caused
the death of a police officer.

522
01:05:47,875 --> 01:05:51,165
Chief Commissioner Filippo Raciti
was hit in the face

523
01:05:51,250 --> 01:05:56,249
by a homemade explosive,
he was taken to Garibaldi Hospital

524
01:05:56,333 --> 01:05:59,624
and died there. Unfortunately,
news just in a moment ago,

525
01:05:59,708 --> 01:06:03,874
it seems there's another officer
from police headquarters in Catania

526
01:06:03,958 --> 01:06:08,499
who's suspended between life
and death at this moment...

527
01:06:08,583 --> 01:06:14,040
A colleague is dead.
A brother.

528
01:06:15,708 --> 01:06:19,457
It's useless crying,
it's time to be pissed off.

529
01:06:19,541 --> 01:06:23,165
Tomorrow we all go
to the Ministry of the Interior,

530
01:06:23,250 --> 01:06:27,415
to talk with the Minister,
to say we don't like dying

531
01:06:27,500 --> 01:06:29,332
like dogs!

532
01:06:33,041 --> 01:06:36,624
Let him go out on the streets
to be killed.

533
01:06:42,583 --> 01:06:44,874
It's our right,
you'd better let us go inside.

534
01:06:44,958 --> 01:06:47,999
Better if you go back to the
barracks and no one gets hurt.

535
01:06:48,083 --> 01:06:51,540
If I order a charge, they'll be
scraping you off the floor.

536
01:06:51,625 --> 01:06:53,957
Think you're the only ones pissed
off for the death of a colleague?

537
01:06:54,041 --> 01:06:56,124
Let us talk to the Minister!

538
01:06:56,208 --> 01:06:58,332
If things are better for everyone,
they are for you too.

539
01:06:58,416 --> 01:07:00,374
We're the police,
it doesn't work that way.

540
01:07:00,458 --> 01:07:03,915
We have to watch
our colleagues die on the streets?

541
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,290
Officer, mind your place.

542
01:07:06,958 --> 01:07:11,082
What's the deal?

543
01:07:11,166 --> 01:07:15,040
Put a delegation together
and you can go talk to a supervisor.

544
01:07:22,291 --> 01:07:25,499
Two of us are going up,
and they'd better listen!

545
01:07:32,083 --> 01:07:36,790
A colleague died,
and no one gives a shit.

546
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:41,582
They look at you, nod,
make promises.

547
01:07:41,666 --> 01:07:43,749
What did you expect?

548
01:07:44,750 --> 01:07:48,332
Think a dead cop
could change things?

549
01:07:50,541 --> 01:07:54,957
Know what I say?
I'm fed up with the Minister,

550
01:07:55,041 --> 01:07:58,665
my son, this job,

551
01:07:59,291 --> 01:08:02,374
this fucking leg
that's not getting better.

552
01:08:06,833 --> 01:08:09,707
The doctor said
I'll limp for the rest of my life.

553
01:08:10,833 --> 01:08:14,165
- What are you saying?
- Just what I said.

554
01:08:21,083 --> 01:08:23,290
- What is it?
- A court order,

555
01:08:23,375 --> 01:08:25,457
suspending visitation rights
with your daughter.

556
01:08:25,625 --> 01:08:28,540
But I signed separation papers
that say I can see her.

557
01:08:28,625 --> 01:08:31,124
Before you abandoned her.

558
01:08:31,208 --> 01:08:33,249
I left her in police barracks,

559
01:08:33,333 --> 01:08:35,832
the safest place in the world.

560
01:08:37,041 --> 01:08:39,915
What can a father do
to get his rights?

561
01:08:40,166 --> 01:08:43,915
My daughter's 8 years old
and has the right to have a father,

562
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:48,415
the law says so, and a father
has the right to see his daughter,

563
01:08:48,500 --> 01:08:54,249
it's the law. Unless
he's a criminal, but I'm not,

564
01:08:54,333 --> 01:08:58,332
I'm a cop, a servant of the State,

565
01:08:58,416 --> 01:09:03,790
paid to defend everyone's rights.
But who defends mine?

566
01:09:04,416 --> 01:09:07,040
As a father, I have no more rights,

567
01:09:07,125 --> 01:09:10,165
you've taken them all away,
like I'm a criminal.

568
01:09:10,250 --> 01:09:14,207
Actually, worse,
because when people come here

569
01:09:14,291 --> 01:09:16,999
wanting to attack you
for stealing from them,

570
01:09:17,083 --> 01:09:21,374
that's when you want me down here,
saving your asses,

571
01:09:21,458 --> 01:09:24,874
defending your rights and of the
damned people who voted for you!

572
01:09:24,958 --> 01:09:27,957
But I can't see my daughter,

573
01:09:28,875 --> 01:09:33,040
because I'm not a cop then,
I'm a criminal.

574
01:09:33,458 --> 01:09:36,457
But that can't be,

575
01:09:36,541 --> 01:09:40,540
either I'm always good for you
or I never am.

576
01:09:40,625 --> 01:09:46,082
So if I'm never good for you,
you can take this uniform back.

577
01:09:47,333 --> 01:09:49,207
Get dressed and get out.

578
01:09:49,916 --> 01:09:51,624
Kick me out.

579
01:09:53,750 --> 01:09:56,665
Get your hands off me
or you'll ruin your pretty suit.

580
01:09:56,750 --> 01:09:58,749
Yesterday evening,
just after 8 p.m.,

581
01:09:58,833 --> 01:10:03,582
Giovanna Reggiani was attacked
as she walked along the path...

582
01:10:05,833 --> 01:10:08,874
Giovanna Reggiani walked
this path every evening

583
01:10:08,958 --> 01:10:13,874
and it's here she was tortured
and raped by a young Romanian

584
01:10:13,958 --> 01:10:17,582
from a gypsy camp
about 1 00 meters away.

585
01:10:19,500 --> 01:10:23,249
A gypsy camp located
in an area City Hall

586
01:10:23,333 --> 01:10:25,790
had promised to clean up.

587
01:10:25,875 --> 01:10:28,874
Councilor candidate
Enrico Mancini says

588
01:10:28,958 --> 01:10:33,124
the city had already activated
evacuation procedures.

589
01:10:44,750 --> 01:10:47,790
It's time to think seriously

590
01:10:47,875 --> 01:10:50,415
about the Roman outskirts.

591
01:10:52,666 --> 01:10:56,249
We're standing in front
of the Regina Coeli prison,

592
01:10:56,333 --> 01:11:00,874
just arriving is the defense
attorney for Romulus Mailat

593
01:11:00,958 --> 01:11:03,832
the 24-year-old Romanian...

594
01:11:03,916 --> 01:11:09,332
You're a piece of shit,
you bastard! You gotta die.

595
01:11:15,291 --> 01:11:18,874
Listen, we have to clear out

596
01:11:18,958 --> 01:11:21,207
Reggiani's murderer's gypsy camp,
get ready.

597
01:11:21,291 --> 01:11:23,499
No messes, Cobra.

598
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,415
You're defending them
instead of protecting us?

599
01:12:06,500 --> 01:12:09,165
You should kick them
out of this country.

600
01:12:09,250 --> 01:12:12,040
Turn that way, you clowns!

601
01:12:12,125 --> 01:12:14,957
Clowns? Step back.

602
01:12:25,208 --> 01:12:27,957
You came to see the show?

603
01:12:28,041 --> 01:12:31,832
You forgot how to maintain order?

604
01:12:31,916 --> 01:12:34,582
They're calling from everywhere,
anger's growing,

605
01:12:34,666 --> 01:12:37,624
if you don't get these Romanians,
there'll be hell to pay.

606
01:12:37,708 --> 01:12:40,499
- Who says?
- The ones who are pissed off.

607
01:12:40,583 --> 01:12:42,165
The ones like you, me, them!

608
01:12:42,250 --> 01:12:45,999
Don't yell, I can hear you.

609
01:12:46,375 --> 01:12:49,040
These Romanians do
what the fuck they want,

610
01:12:49,125 --> 01:12:53,290
we need to show them
this is our motherland.

611
01:12:53,375 --> 01:12:57,415
- It's our home.
- Right!

612
01:13:05,791 --> 01:13:10,707
Ma'am, a euro,
a euro for a sandwich.

613
01:13:44,791 --> 01:13:48,374
I didn't like your show
outside Parliament, not at all.

614
01:13:59,083 --> 01:14:03,415
Article 48?
I'm not crazy.

615
01:14:03,500 --> 01:14:05,457
A psych visit will decide that.

616
01:14:05,541 --> 01:14:08,832
You're on suspension
for the time being.

617
01:14:09,291 --> 01:14:10,540
You can go.

618
01:14:31,541 --> 01:14:34,790
If you wanna dance,
I can help you too.

619
01:14:34,875 --> 01:14:37,457
- Why are you here?
- Am I bothering you?

620
01:14:37,541 --> 01:14:40,499
What the fuck's this guy looking at?
Did I spoil the party?

621
01:14:40,583 --> 01:14:43,207
You say you're with our kid
but you're screwing him?

622
01:14:43,291 --> 01:14:45,624
- What?
- Want to screw my wife, Cuba?

623
01:14:45,708 --> 01:14:48,957
- You're wrong.
- I'm not wrong at all.

624
01:14:49,083 --> 01:14:51,374
What are you doing? I work here,

625
01:14:51,458 --> 01:14:54,249
want to get me fired?
Is it revenge?

626
01:14:54,333 --> 01:14:57,040
Take it out on yourself,
not on me.

627
01:14:57,125 --> 01:15:01,374
Look at you,
you like playing crazy.

628
01:15:01,458 --> 01:15:04,915
It makes you feel important,
the master of the world!

629
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:08,124
What do you and your friends say?
"Take back the motherland".

630
01:15:08,208 --> 01:15:11,499
But this isn't your home
and you're not crazy,

631
01:15:11,583 --> 01:15:14,082
you're just a poor asshole.

632
01:15:31,541 --> 01:15:35,665
I really fucked up.
I really fucked up.

633
01:15:38,708 --> 01:15:42,540
You earn 1 ,400 euros a month,
with overtime it's 1 ,800,

634
01:15:42,625 --> 01:15:45,915
you do a few jobs off duty
and get to 2,000.

635
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:47,832
You go to Cuba, you're rich,

636
01:15:47,916 --> 01:15:51,999
you meet a girl at a disco,
you tell her you're rich,

637
01:15:52,083 --> 01:15:55,665
she loves you,
you marry her,

638
01:15:56,291 --> 01:15:58,915
but when you come back
you're still making 2,000 a month

639
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:01,582
and you each have nothing to say.

640
01:16:01,666 --> 01:16:06,165
You go back to being a fucking cop
and a Cuban whore.

641
01:16:07,125 --> 01:16:09,290
But he shouldn't have had a kid.

642
01:16:09,375 --> 01:16:11,082
What do you want to do?

643
01:16:12,875 --> 01:16:14,624
Nero's a brother,

644
01:16:15,500 --> 01:16:17,499
brothers make mistakes,
but you don't abandon them.

645
01:16:17,583 --> 01:16:20,999
- He hit his wife!
- You don't abandon brothers.

646
01:16:21,833 --> 01:16:23,540
Ever.

647
01:16:31,166 --> 01:16:34,374
- You've seen a doctor?
- What did you come for?

648
01:16:35,625 --> 01:16:40,207
- To fix this thing.
- It can't be fixed anymore.

649
01:16:41,458 --> 01:16:45,415
Miriam,
Nero made a mistake, but...

650
01:16:45,500 --> 01:16:49,249
the two of you have
to resolve this

651
01:16:49,333 --> 01:16:52,124
just between you.

652
01:16:53,666 --> 01:16:56,790
Talk to each other and
things go back like they were.

653
01:16:56,875 --> 01:17:00,957
I say this for your good,
and especially for your daughter's.

654
01:17:01,041 --> 01:17:03,624
Who are you to talk about
the good of my daughter?

655
01:17:03,708 --> 01:17:07,624
You just don't want your friend
to go to jail for beating me.

656
01:17:07,708 --> 01:17:10,457
He has to, his place is in jail.

657
01:17:10,541 --> 01:17:15,957
Nero's already in trouble, if you
report him now, he'll lose his job!

658
01:17:17,541 --> 01:17:20,749
Then who'll support your daughter?

659
01:17:20,875 --> 01:17:23,332
You thought about that?

660
01:17:25,291 --> 01:17:27,665
You're using my daughter
to save his ass,

661
01:17:27,750 --> 01:17:31,665
you're a shit just like him,
get out.

662
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,124
What's there to look at?

663
01:17:53,333 --> 01:17:58,499
Understand, Ma'am?
I'm sorry, this is all I can do.

664
01:17:58,583 --> 01:18:00,790
For the moment,

665
01:18:00,875 --> 01:18:04,582
the city assigns you a hotel room,
it's not much, but...

666
01:18:09,125 --> 01:18:11,832
You can keep your charity.

667
01:18:13,416 --> 01:18:18,665
Put that stuff down.
Put that fucking stuff down!

668
01:18:21,416 --> 01:18:25,707
Careful, I'll report you for verbal
abuse of a police officer.

669
01:18:43,083 --> 01:18:44,790
The judge.

670
01:18:50,458 --> 01:18:56,457
According to article 530.2
of the Code of Criminal Procedure...

671
01:19:43,166 --> 01:19:45,749
Acquitted!

672
01:20:04,166 --> 01:20:07,040
My new address,

673
01:20:07,125 --> 01:20:09,874
you might need it
to come asking for my vote.

674
01:20:09,958 --> 01:20:11,874
I'm sorry, I need time.

675
01:20:11,958 --> 01:20:16,874
You need time? My mother's living
in a 35-square meter cellar

676
01:20:16,958 --> 01:20:20,999
for 700 euros a month,
that's all we can afford.

677
01:20:21,958 --> 01:20:25,040
There's not only your mother,
but lots of people,

678
01:20:25,125 --> 01:20:27,374
it's a complex problem...

679
01:20:27,458 --> 01:20:30,999
A right's a right,
nothing fucking 'complex' about it.

680
01:20:31,083 --> 01:20:33,832
My mother has a right to that house,
but she can't move in

681
01:20:33,916 --> 01:20:38,540
because the State's lost respect for
itself, for the rules, for rights,

682
01:20:38,625 --> 01:20:42,374
because it's governed
by pieces of shit like you.

683
01:20:44,083 --> 01:20:47,624
I see why you're a riot cop:
because you're an idiot.

684
01:20:47,708 --> 01:20:50,290
Only an idiot can be a riot cop.

685
01:20:55,791 --> 01:20:57,957
Now call the cops, asshole.

686
01:21:05,291 --> 01:21:08,957
- You're sure? - The ones
who knifed Mazinga are there,

687
01:21:09,041 --> 01:21:12,332
- definitely.
- Why doesn't Special Ops go?

688
01:21:12,416 --> 01:21:18,165
What's the problem? They're there
and we'll go get 'em, they're ours!

689
01:21:18,250 --> 01:21:22,082
- Let's call Special Ops.
- Why? - Leave it to them.

690
01:21:23,041 --> 01:21:25,082
We'll go get 'em,

691
01:21:25,166 --> 01:21:27,082
and call our Special Ops afterwards.

692
01:21:31,125 --> 01:21:33,499
What do we do?

693
01:21:39,708 --> 01:21:41,415
Let's go.

694
01:21:46,875 --> 01:21:49,499
- We'll go get them.
- Fuck 'em.

695
01:21:59,958 --> 01:22:02,832
If you don't want to come,
you can go home.

696
01:22:22,833 --> 01:22:24,540
Knock it off.

697
01:22:30,875 --> 01:22:38,207
Riot police, sons-of-bitches...

698
01:22:42,291 --> 01:22:45,790
- Knock that off. - Don't like
the music or the lyrics?

699
01:24:44,416 --> 01:24:46,124
Stop!

700
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:27,165
It was hidden in the bathroom.

701
01:25:30,083 --> 01:25:31,790
It's full of blades.

702
01:25:33,125 --> 01:25:34,874
And there's this too.

703
01:25:56,458 --> 01:25:59,790
They're the ones who beat up
the Albanians at the supermarket.

704
01:26:07,458 --> 01:26:09,790
Take your son home,

705
01:26:09,875 --> 01:26:13,040
tell him to forget everything,
forever.

706
01:26:13,125 --> 01:26:15,207
I'll reset these guys' memories,

707
01:26:15,291 --> 01:26:19,874
if they want to tell,
the bag goes to the judge.

708
01:26:23,958 --> 01:26:25,540
- Call Special Ops.
- Not today.

709
01:26:25,625 --> 01:26:29,082
- Do it now.
- I said no, today's a tie.

710
01:26:29,166 --> 01:26:32,540
Today's a tie? We're the police.

711
01:26:33,208 --> 01:26:34,957
Or are these speeches
only for the others?

712
01:26:35,041 --> 01:26:37,624
- That guy's the son of a brother.
- He's a shit.

713
01:26:38,125 --> 01:26:42,124
Him and his friends knife
our brothers,

714
01:26:42,208 --> 01:26:45,874
- or have you forgotten?
- Today it ends right here.

715
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:49,749
- Is that clear?
- No, it's not.

716
01:26:51,416 --> 01:26:54,540
- It's not right.
- Want to call the cops? Go ahead.

717
01:26:54,625 --> 01:26:56,874
But you have to do it.

718
01:27:02,208 --> 01:27:04,582
I'm not getting a brother
in trouble,

719
01:27:04,666 --> 01:27:08,290
not even when he smashes
some guy's face on a train.

720
01:27:17,375 --> 01:27:19,415
Go home, take a shower,

721
01:27:19,500 --> 01:27:22,707
and forget,
because nothing happened today.

722
01:27:24,875 --> 01:27:27,332
Nothing happened.

723
01:28:13,958 --> 01:28:15,665
What happened?

724
01:28:17,958 --> 01:28:19,665
Nothing.

725
01:28:22,833 --> 01:28:25,207
Will you tell me what happened?

726
01:28:29,083 --> 01:28:33,540
Nothing... nothing happened!

727
01:28:41,166 --> 01:28:44,999
Hide this bag,
it's our life insurance.

728
01:28:45,083 --> 01:28:48,290
- A shit life.
- Whatever you like,

729
01:28:48,375 --> 01:28:50,915
but put this fuckin' bag away.

730
01:29:17,166 --> 01:29:19,499
Go away or I'll call for help.

731
01:29:20,250 --> 01:29:23,582
Last night I was about to smash
in Giancarlo's head, Mazinga's son.

732
01:29:24,416 --> 01:29:26,874
I wanted to slaughter him,

733
01:29:27,583 --> 01:29:30,540
because him and his friends
knifed his father.

734
01:29:30,625 --> 01:29:32,707
His friends knifed his father

735
01:29:32,791 --> 01:29:34,999
and I wanted to kill his son.

736
01:29:35,833 --> 01:29:37,957
What do you want from me?

737
01:29:39,166 --> 01:29:41,874
Let me see Carolina again.

738
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:45,790
Please,

739
01:29:45,875 --> 01:29:48,457
she's the only nice thing I have.

740
01:29:49,416 --> 01:29:51,124
Please.

741
01:30:04,833 --> 01:30:06,790
- Hello.
- Come in.

742
01:30:15,416 --> 01:30:17,999
Why did you ask to see me?

743
01:30:26,500 --> 01:30:28,207
What is it?

744
01:30:32,625 --> 01:30:36,540
Aggravated assault?
Is this a joke?

745
01:30:37,208 --> 01:30:39,207
What do you want him for?

746
01:30:39,291 --> 01:30:43,249
He's accused of the attempted murder
of three Albanians.

747
01:30:43,333 --> 01:30:45,624
And this is for you.

748
01:31:12,083 --> 01:31:16,207
Five minutes, then leave,
only because you're a colleague.

749
01:31:16,625 --> 01:31:18,332
Thank you.

750
01:31:27,041 --> 01:31:31,040
Listen to me... When the judge
questions you, deny everything.

751
01:31:31,125 --> 01:31:33,499
Clashes at the stadium,
beating up the Albanians,

752
01:31:33,583 --> 01:31:37,790
you know nothing,
you didn't do anything.

753
01:31:37,875 --> 01:31:43,040
Understand?
Are you listening?

754
01:31:43,125 --> 01:31:45,124
Yeah, you want me to say
I wasn't there,

755
01:31:45,208 --> 01:31:48,540
but I was and I want it known
I did the right thing.

756
01:31:48,625 --> 01:31:50,957
- What?
- I did what had to be done!

757
01:31:51,041 --> 01:31:53,915
These guys steal our jobs,
they rape and kill,

758
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:58,082
someone has to deal with it,
since you and your friends don't.

759
01:31:58,166 --> 01:32:01,749
So you and your friends will?
What is it?

760
01:32:01,833 --> 01:32:06,082
You're scared if I tell the truth,
that you'll be mixed up in it?

761
01:32:10,083 --> 01:32:12,915
I'm already mixed up in it.

762
01:32:16,583 --> 01:32:19,499
I've been mixed up in it
my whole life.

763
01:32:23,583 --> 01:32:25,457
You're sixteen,

764
01:32:27,250 --> 01:32:31,832
don't ruin yourself, Giancarlo,
don't ruin your life.

765
01:32:38,250 --> 01:32:40,374
As long as you're under
investigation,

766
01:32:40,458 --> 01:32:42,582
this is the best thing.

767
01:32:46,250 --> 01:32:47,957
It's for your own good.

768
01:33:12,500 --> 01:33:14,290
You're a rat.

769
01:34:20,625 --> 01:34:22,624
You're hiding, huh?

770
01:34:25,500 --> 01:34:29,540
Good for you.
You shouldn't be afraid,

771
01:34:31,333 --> 01:34:34,665
no one wants to dirty their hands
with a guy like you.

772
01:34:42,291 --> 01:34:47,457
Know why? Because you're worth
less than this piss.

773
01:34:58,625 --> 01:35:03,124
- So, what are you worth?
- You have the nerve to talk?

774
01:35:03,208 --> 01:35:06,665
Nero and Mazinga are screwed
because of you, they'll be suspended

775
01:35:06,750 --> 01:35:10,915
and then discharged.
You're a traitor.

776
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:14,374
So, what are you, cops?

777
01:35:14,458 --> 01:35:19,207
Riot cops,
who piss and spit on their uniforms,

778
01:35:19,291 --> 01:35:23,040
every time you cover your ass
and your friends'.

779
01:35:23,125 --> 01:35:27,082
No, you ain't shit now,
you're fucking nothing.

780
01:35:27,166 --> 01:35:30,999
Next time I see you, I'll kill you.

781
01:35:32,083 --> 01:35:37,374
I wanted an honest job,
and being a cop's an honest job.

782
01:35:41,208 --> 01:35:44,040
That's why I'm in the police.

783
01:35:56,541 --> 01:36:01,582
It was no accident,
the cop shot to kill, understand?

784
01:36:01,666 --> 01:36:04,749
Everyone in Rome knew Gabriele,
he was a good kid,

785
01:36:04,833 --> 01:36:07,999
a brother, and the cops killed him.

786
01:36:08,083 --> 01:36:12,124
Explain why, when Raciti died,
they suspended all the games

787
01:36:12,208 --> 01:36:15,707
and instead, today the games are on.
Where's the justice?

788
01:36:15,791 --> 01:36:17,374
There is none.

789
01:36:17,458 --> 01:36:21,415
A 28 year-old guy
isn't worth a cop.

790
01:36:25,125 --> 01:36:28,374
It's 4 p.m., welcome back
on the air. A Sunday to forget.

791
01:36:28,458 --> 01:36:32,790
A young man of 26, Gabriele Sandri,
was killed this morning

792
01:36:32,875 --> 01:36:36,124
at a rest stop
along the A1 highway, near Arezzo.

793
01:36:36,208 --> 01:36:38,457
The victim is a Lazio Team fan,

794
01:36:38,541 --> 01:36:42,332
hit by the gunfire
of a police officer.

795
01:36:42,416 --> 01:36:46,207
His name is Gabriele Sandri,
it was a tragic error,

796
01:36:46,291 --> 01:36:49,915
as announced this afternoon
by the Arezzo Chief of Police.

797
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:53,332
We'll go to the rest stop

798
01:36:53,416 --> 01:36:55,832
with our correspondent...

799
01:36:59,875 --> 01:37:02,915
Get ready, we're dancing tonight.

800
01:37:06,750 --> 01:37:08,457
Carletto, what is it?

801
01:37:08,541 --> 01:37:11,540
They're organizing.
Roma fans, Lazio fans, skinheads,

802
01:37:11,625 --> 01:37:13,582
all out to get you.

803
01:37:13,666 --> 01:37:15,874
They're meeting at the stadium,

804
01:37:15,958 --> 01:37:18,832
they want to kill a cop,
an eye for an eye.

805
01:37:20,125 --> 01:37:21,957
We're right here.

806
01:37:22,041 --> 01:37:25,207
Fuck you, they want a corpse!

807
01:37:25,291 --> 01:37:27,207
Bye.

808
01:37:29,375 --> 01:37:32,624
- Everyone outside, we're leaving.
- The game's been cancelled.

809
01:37:32,708 --> 01:37:36,332
But not our assignment.
Come on, guys, move your asses.

810
01:37:36,416 --> 01:37:40,874
Inspector, don't send just the guys
on duty, it's not enough.

811
01:37:40,958 --> 01:37:42,207
Want to send the army?

812
01:37:42,291 --> 01:37:44,624
The shits are organizing,

813
01:37:44,708 --> 01:37:47,999
there's thousands of 'em,
they're pissed off, we're too few.

814
01:37:48,083 --> 01:37:50,957
- These are the orders.
- They're crap.

815
01:37:51,041 --> 01:37:53,749
Get promoted,
then you can give the orders.

816
01:37:53,833 --> 01:37:55,415
Then you don't understand,

817
01:37:55,500 --> 01:37:59,249
the politicians want our blood,
they want another Raciti

818
01:37:59,375 --> 01:38:02,999
to make people forget the screw-up
of one jerk in a uniform.

819
01:38:04,250 --> 01:38:07,165
You'd prefer to be exempted
from duty?

820
01:38:08,875 --> 01:38:11,374
Exempt my ass.

821
01:38:20,333 --> 01:38:23,457
I have to pick up
my personal belongings.

822
01:43:28,625 --> 01:43:33,999
Now I feel safe, with a cripple
and a nutjob covering my ass.

823
01:43:54,375 --> 01:43:57,707
What was the name
of that school in Genoa?

824
01:43:58,500 --> 01:44:00,874
I bet we pay for it tonight.

825
01:45:27,166 --> 01:45:29,749
Here they come!
