莱姆酒日记

10
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:21,830
飞吧*
Volare

11
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:29,380
唱吧*
Cantare

12
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:36,800
让我们飞入云端*
Let's fly way up to the clouds

13
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:40,470
远离攘攘尘凡*
Away from the maddening crowds

14
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:44,810
沐浴在星光下歌唱*
We can sing in the glow of a star that I know of

15
00:01:44,890 --> 00:01:47,890
爱恋的人儿正缱绻*
Where lovers enjoy peace of mind

16
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:50,730
让我们忘却人间纷扰*
Let us leave the confusion

17
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:54,320
抛开俗世的羁绊*
And all disillusion behind

18
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:57,900
如比翼鸟儿一般*
Just like birds of a feather

19
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:01,700
共赏彩虹七色斑斓*
A rainbow together we'll find

20
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:05,330
飞啊*
Volare

21
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:12,290
唱啊*
E cantare

22
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:21,140
心儿为何在欢唱*
No wonder my happy heart sings

23
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:24,390
是爱赐予了我翅膀*
Your love has given me wings

24
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,390
波多黎各联碳公司欢迎您

25
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:14,440
-谁啊  -客房服务
- Who is it? - Room service.

26
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:18,190
鸡蛋吗
Is it eggs?

27
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:20,610
不知道  先生  不是我点的
I don't know, sir. I didn't order it.

28
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:40,630
要来些水吗
You want some water with that?

29
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,130
不  不用了
No, no. No, I don't.

30
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,260
看来您昨晚有的忙啊
Looks like you had a night.

31
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:51,180
好蛋
They look perfect.

32
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:52,730
出去吧
Get out.

33
00:03:57,570 --> 00:04:01,240
本来我想找服务员来着
I intended to bring that to the attention of a member of staff.

34
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:04,990
这玩意儿弄不开
I had some difficulty getting it to open.

35
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,330
门钥匙里那把小的  先生
It's the little key on the door key, sir.

36
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:10,580
哦
Right.

37
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:18,000
我是想找点坚果
I was looking for some nuts.

38
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:24,800
原则上我不喝酒
I tend to avoid alcohol.

39
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:30,470
没酒的时候不喝
When I can.

40
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:43,070
我不会说西语
I don't speak Spanish.

41
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:11,140
四块五  没零钱
Cuatro cincuenta. No change.

42
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,260
不  不  你压根儿没听
No, no, no, no, you're not listening.

43
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:52,430
我是说海盗队  不是洋基队
I said the Pirates, not the Yankees.

44
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:54,350
我跟你说  今年罗伯特该火了
It's going to be Roberto's year, I'm telling you.

45
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:56,020
我找罗特曼先生
Looking for Mr. Lotterman.

46
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:57,520
里边那间
End of the room.

47
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:00,150
不  是海盗队
No, no, the Pirates.

48
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:01,770
你们这帮家伙全得完蛋
You guys are going to be all over.

49
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:03,400
那可是罗伯特・克莱门蒂啊  老兄
It's Roberto Clemente, man.

50
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,610
还有  我想说一下...
And by the way, I want to talk about...

51
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:10,610
主编  E・J・罗特曼

52
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:14,290
现在没空
Not now!

53
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:18,040
他现在是周五危机
He's having the Friday crisis.

54
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:23,170
-你是坎普  -对
- You Kemp? - Yeah.

55
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:25,840
他以为你昨天到
He was expecting you yesterday.

56
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:27,380
那边天气不好
We had some weather.

57
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:28,590
是  听说了
Yeah, I heard.

58
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,380
纽约下大雪
Big snow in New York.

59
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:33,800
他还打电话呢  来点咖啡吗
He's still on a call. You want some coffee?

60
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:35,060
不了  谢谢
No, thanks.

61
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:36,430
门口折腾什么呢
What's all the fuss out front?

62
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:37,980
你从前门进来吗
You came in the front?

63
00:06:38,890 --> 00:06:40,310
我们不走前门
We don't use that door.

64
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:42,690
除非那帮乡巴佬消停下来
Not when los jibaros pitch up.

65
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:44,230
他们要干嘛
What do they want?

66
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,320
不知道
I don't know.

67
00:06:45,690 --> 00:06:47,820
也就低保那些屁事
Some fucked idea of a living wage.

68
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:50,780
在那儿断断续续闹腾几个月了
They've been out there on and off for months.

69
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:53,910
对了  我叫萨拉
By the way, my name's Sala.

70
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:55,950
鲍勃・萨拉  摄影师
Bob Sala, staff photographer.

71
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,330
见到你很高兴  鲍勃
Pleased to meet you, Bob.

72
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,580
嗯
Yeah.

73
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:00,580
他打完了
He's off.

74
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:04,000
再试着轻轻敲敲门吧
You might want to try another subservient knock.

75
00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:05,500
好
Yeah.

76
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:08,710
坎普
Kemp.

77
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:10,720
假装没看见他假发
Don't notice the wig.

78
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:17,390
干嘛  进
Yeah. What?

79
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:31,400
如果你是我想找的那个  坐下吧
If you're who I think you are, you better sit down.

80
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:44,790
你觉得屋里太亮吗
You find it a little bright in here?

81
00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:48,210
我想摘了  可眼睛有点问题
I'd take them off, but I have a medical condition.

82
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:49,880
什么意思  你是个瞎子
What do you mean, you're blind?

83
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:52,050
结膜炎  先生
Conjunctivitis, sir.

84
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:54,930
就是红眼病吧
The old red eye, huh?

85
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:02,690
你过来得真是时候  坎普先生
You arrive at a very, very trying time, Mr. Kemp.

86
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:04,980
现在烂事一桩接一桩
One of those days stacking up.

87
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:07,150
所以  我们也不讲究什么了
So, uh, why don't we cut through the niceties

88
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:08,690
直入主题好吗
and just get right to it, huh?

89
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:10,480
我也希望如此
That's how I like to proceed.

90
00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:12,240
好  这是你的简历
Okay. Your resume here.

91
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:18,410
很不简单
Very impressive CV.

92
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:20,790
没错
Yeah.

93
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:23,250
一些地方你包装得真不错
You worked your way up some interesting titles.

94
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:27,330
我很喜欢这个"西语流利"
I really like the "Fluent Spanish."

95
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:28,750
厉害啊
Wow.

96
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:35,220
你这简历...就是坨狗屎
This CV... This CV is a bunch of bullshit.

97
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:37,600
是吗
Is it?

98
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:39,850
这两天的电传稿
This is two days on the wire.

99
00:08:39,930 --> 00:08:42,520
有一天的缺失
A day dead. We don't have it.

100
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:48,900
莫伯格搞得哪一出
What is the matter with Moburg?

101
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:52,360
他这跟死人有什么两样
He's about as useful as a dug-up body.

102
00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:05,330
坎普先生  这报纸的问题就是
You see, the problem with this newspaper, Mr. Kemp,

103
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:08,170
连我都不愿意看
is that I am among many who don't enjoy reading it.

104
00:09:09,130 --> 00:09:10,540
而且发行量低迷
We have an ailing circulation,

105
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:12,250
我一看周围这群废物
and I just have to look around this building

106
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:13,880
就明白为什么这样了
to understand why.

107
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:17,720
没有责任心  自负
Lack of commitment and too much self-indulgence.

108
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:22,430
所以我要寻找激情
So what I'm looking for

109
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,560
寻找活力
is some enthusiasm, some energy,

110
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,560
寻找新鲜血液
some fresh blood.

111
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:31,070
于是我想问你的第一个问题就是
And the question that I'm asking myself

112
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:33,360
你有多少酒量
is how much alcohol is usual in yours.

113
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:35,030
我血液里的吗
My fresh blood?

114
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:36,400
你能喝多少
How much do you drink?

115
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:39,280
我比能喝的人稍差点
I suppose at the upper end of "Social."

116
00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:41,200
不过准备戒了
I'm poised to give up.

117
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:43,080
波多黎各可不是个
Well, Puerto Rico may not be

118
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,790
戒酒的好地方
the best place on Earth to do that.

119
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,750
别紧张  坎普先生
Don't look so anxious, Mr. Kemp.

120
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,200
我要是不雇你
I wouldn't have paid for

121
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,170
也不会掏钱让你住酒店
your hotel if I hadn't already hired you.

122
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:56,300
不过这不是废物聚集地
But this is not the Last Chance Saloon,

123
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:58,630
我也不想再雇个大酒鬼
and I do not need another heavy drinker.

124
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:01,600
从你墨镜后面的眼睛我就看得出来
Which I perceive, from the condition of eyeballs behind glasses,

125
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,390
你也是个酒鬼
that you might very well qualify as.

126
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:05,890
这是眼病  罗特曼先生
This is a medical condition, Mr. Lotterman.

127
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,690
我知道这看起来像别的原因  不过这
I know it might look like something else, but this is a...

128
00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:08,850
看着就他妈像宿醉
Looks like a fuckin' hangover.

129
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:09,980
是吗
Does it?

130
00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:18,700
过来
Come here.

131
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:24,200
这就是我想看到的献身精神
That's the kind of commitment I like to see in a man.

132
00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:28,120
果敢  加之以适当的人性
Oh! Determination, balanced with appropriate humanity.

133
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:30,460
对  对  就这样
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

134
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:35,050
你是哪边的  坎普
Which side do you dress, Kemp?

135
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:36,800
什么
I beg your pardon?

136
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:38,170
政治倾向
Politics.

137
00:10:39,130 --> 00:10:40,470
我算是中间派吧
I kind of hang in the middle.

138
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:46,560
这是个分裂的社会  坎普
This is a schizoid society, Kemp.

139
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,050
他们操两种语言  挂两样国旗
They got two languages, two flags

140
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:49,850
心怀不同的归属  唱不同的国歌
two loyalties, two anthems.

141
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:51,310
我们带来了他们前所未见的事物
We bring them stuff they never had.

142
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,810
他们要么恨之切切  要么欲罢不能
They either hate it or they want more of it.

143
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:54,320
这里不能算是美国的地盘
It's a reluctant part of America.

144
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,440
就像长了热带水果的英国吧
It's like an England with tropical fruit.

145
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:57,820
鲍勃
Bob.

146
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:59,190
这就是我要见那人
Just the man I wanted to see.

147
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:01,320
保罗・坎普  从纽约来加盟我们的
This is Paul Kemp. He's joining us from New York.

148
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:02,660
是  我们已经见过
Yeah, yeah, we already met.

149
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:05,490
那位是克里夫・多诺万先生  体育版的
Uh, that's... That's Mr. Clive Donovan, sports.

150
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:07,120
那位休伯特先生  会计
And this is Mr . Hubert, accounting.

151
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,500
帮我个忙好吗
Listen, do me a favor, will you?

152
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:10,000
带他转转  看看规章制度
Show him around, the dos and don'ts.

153
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,420
介绍下各位同事
Introduce him to some of the guys.

154
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:12,670
我带他去埃尔办公室
I'll take him up to Al's.

155
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:13,790
去那干吗
Oh, the hell you will.

156
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:14,920
领他去资料室
You take him to the library.

157
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,130
你调些合订本出来
You pull out some volumes.

158
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:17,460
先让他大致了解一下这份报纸
I want him to get a sense of the paper.

159
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:19,590
做点笔记  看看前几年的东西
You know, make some notes, go back a few years,

160
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:21,510
尤其是保龄球方面
paying particular attention to bowling alleys.

161
00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:22,760
这边有保龄球
There's bowling and bowling alleys.

162
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,260
在这里很火  拓展得很快
Very big here. They're up like mushrooms.

163
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:25,510
每周都有新球馆开张
A new one premieres every week.

164
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,010
-来过波多黎各吗  -没有
- Been to Puerto Rico before? - No.

165
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:28,470
你会爱上这里的
Oh, you're going to fall right into it.

166
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,560
这里正值大发展  坎普  机会无限
There's a boom on here, Kemp. It's an open door.

167
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,850
只要好好把握  这就是你的天下 
You play it right, you can surf the place.

168
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:36,820
你懂星座吗
What do you know about horoscopes?

169
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:37,900
不了解
Nothing.

170
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:39,360
要是我都能写  你也行
Ah, well, if I can write one, you can.

171
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:42,530
所以  每天一篇《明星星座》专栏
So it's every day with a special "Star's Star"

172
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:44,370
礼拜六来点贝蒂・格拉波和尼尔・塞达卡的八卦
featured Saturday with Betty Grable

173
00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:46,330
这就差不多了
and Neil Sedaka, things like that.

174
00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:49,120
好吧  你需要的一切都在这了
So here, everything you need is right there.

175
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:52,330
这称作《拉松加夫人预言》
It's called "Madam La Zonga Predicts."

176
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:53,670
拉松加夫人怎么了
What happened to Madam La Zonga?

177
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:55,250
废掉了
He got canceled.

178
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:56,420
什么意思  解雇了吗
What do you mean, fired?

179
00:11:56,630 --> 00:11:57,800
被强暴致死
They raped him to death.

180
00:11:59,130 --> 00:12:00,590
强暴致死
They raped him to death?

181
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,880
这岛上没几个地方
There are very few places on this island

182
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:04,340
我不愿意去
I decline to visit,

183
00:12:04,430 --> 00:12:06,220
不过坎达度码头西侧
but the toilets frequented by sailors

184
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:08,810
水手出没的厕所就是其一
on the west side of Candado Pier is one.

185
00:12:09,810 --> 00:12:11,230
他被强暴致死
They raped him to death?

186
00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:13,480
拉松加死在一个厕所隔间
La Zonga died in a cubicle.

187
00:12:14,770 --> 00:12:17,310
那个  你不是搞艺术的吧  坎普
Say, you're not, uh, artistic, are you, Kemp?

188
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:18,900
不是
Oh, no.

189
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:21,490
那最好就不要抽薄荷烟了
You might want to rethink those menthol cigarettes.

190
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,990
一点好处没有
They don't do a thing for you.

191
00:12:43,010 --> 00:12:44,220
有空去逛
Come by the house.

192
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:45,380
好的
I will.

193
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:49,260
我喜欢你的东西
I like your stuff.

194
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:51,890
发给罗特曼的剪报
The cuttings you sent to Lotterman.

195
00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:54,020
写得真不错
Oh. It's good writing.

196
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:55,350
谢谢
Thanks.

197
00:12:58,860 --> 00:12:59,940
回头聊
We'll talk.

198
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:03,940
再加一层
One more floor!

199
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:08,620
半年前他们装上了自动打包机
They put in automated packing machines about six months ago.

200
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:10,780
几乎全部机械化了
They mechanized almost everything.

201
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:13,620
过去下面用五十号人  现在只要五个
There used to be 50 guys down here. Now there's five.

202
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:15,370
所以才有现在的"街头狂欢"
Hence happiness in the street.

203
00:13:17,170 --> 00:13:18,750
入职留念
Souvenir, day one.

204
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:22,670
为想入非非的美人们干杯
Here's to pretty women with filthy thoughts.

205
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,180
-要汉堡吗  -不用
- Want a burger? - No.

206
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:28,680
-汉堡  -不  谢谢
- Burger? - No, thanks.

207
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:30,350
尝尝看  两个
Try it. Dos.

208
00:13:31,930 --> 00:13:33,390
入职过程怎么样
So how was the induction?

209
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:34,810
有点担心
Somewhat fraught.

210
00:13:34,890 --> 00:13:38,480
恕我直言  保罗  他真是没的挑了
No disrespect, Paul, but he didn't have a lot of choice.

211
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,900
你知道有多少人应聘这个职位吗
You know how many people applied for the job?

212
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:42,400
就你一个
One. You.

213
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:43,650
真的啊
Is that right?

214
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:45,860
即便如此  我还是觉得没表现好
Even then, I thought I'd blown it.

215
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:47,320
话题尽围绕着我的劣势
Zeroed in on my weakest spot.

216
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:48,820
什么劣势
Which is what?

217
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:50,490
两部半没出版的小说
Two and a half unpublished novels

218
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:51,910
还有一样扯淡的推荐信
and references of equal fiction.

219
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:53,410
你是小说家啊
Oh, you're a novelist.

220
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:55,790
说起来也算
Mmm, in a manner of speaking.

221
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,540
可就是没人读过
Can't even get read.

222
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:00,000
所以我想还是码点字赚几个钱
So I figured I'd do some words for money,

223
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,420
过一两年再看
see how it's looking in a year or two.

224
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:02,790
在《星报》啊
At El Star?

225
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:05,090
你刚来真不忍告诉你
Hate to tell you this on the way in,

226
00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:07,300
可这张报纸正走下坡路
but this publication's on its way out.

227
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:09,840
就我来看  马上就要撑不下去了
And as far as I'm concerned, it can't come soon enough.

228
00:14:09,930 --> 00:14:11,350
不会吧
Not going to happen.

229
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:13,430
要打赌吗
You like a little vonga on that?

230
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:16,230
我跟你赌报纸六月份停办  6.5的赔率
I'll give you 13 to 2 this thing's over by June.

231
00:14:16,310 --> 00:14:17,560
他们都要掐掉电传了
They're going to cut the cord.

232
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:19,230
那干嘛还更换新设备
Then why put in all the new machinery?

233
00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:21,690
说的是啊  看他怎么解释
Precisely my point, and he can't answer it.

234
00:14:21,770 --> 00:14:24,400
我真懒得争  明摆着的
Well, like I'm tired of arguing the obvious.

235
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,900
走吧  吃点东西
Come on. Let's eat.

236
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:28,740
我要去找个人  谈马匹的事
Now, I got to go and see a man about a horse.

237
00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:31,780
很高兴认识你  保罗
Good to meet you, Paul.

238
00:14:35,290 --> 00:14:38,500
古老的圣胡安又迎来了新的一夜
Another night unfolds over Old San Juan.

239
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:40,670
你来很久了吗
You been here long?

240
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:42,250
太久了
Too long.

241
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:44,170
这地方就像你已经上过的姑娘
This place is like someone you fucked

242
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:45,460
却还赖在你的身下
and they're still under you.

243
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,050
干嘛不辞职呢
Why don't you quit?

244
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:48,670
退路无处不在
Life's full of exits.

245
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:51,840
因为我要等报社垮掉  领取遣散费
Because I'm waiting for it to collapse so I get the payoff.

246
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:54,810
三千块足够我扎进墨西哥了
Three grand redundancy puts me in Mexico.

247
00:14:56,470 --> 00:14:59,140
别向左看
Don't look left.

248
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:01,980
你肯定不想认识他
That's an introduction you don't want to have.

249
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,610
他是谁
Who's he?

250
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:07,280
报社所有问题的缩影
Living example of everything that's wrong with this paper.

251
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,190
他叫莫伯格
His name's Moburg.

252
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:12,860
罪案与宗教事务部记者
Our Crime and Religious Affairs correspondent.

253
00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:15,490
罗特曼见不到他人  想炒他都炒不掉
Lotterman can't fire him because he never sees him.

254
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:17,200
白天他基本不出门
He's rarely out in daylight.

255
00:15:17,290 --> 00:15:18,790
看他很爱喝酒啊
Looks like he enjoys a drink.

256
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:22,120
他现在脑子里只有朗姆酒了
The entire substructure of his brain is eaten away with rum.

257
00:15:22,830 --> 00:15:25,630
跟你说吧  这报社完了
I'm telling you, this enterprise is doomed.

258
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,420
楼里可能就三四个职员
There's maybe three or four

259
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:30,260
苦苦支撑着
professionals in the building running the entire show.

260
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:33,800
等一下  谁是豪尔・桑德森
Wait a minute. Who is Hal Sanderson?

261
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,430
在资料室  他是谁
In the library. Who's he?

262
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:38,930
过去他在报社
He used to work for the paper.

263
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:42,310
现在他自封为公关顾问
Now he's what he says he is a PR consultant.

264
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:45,310
向美国佬四处推销地皮
Selling this place street by street to the Yankees.

265
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:49,190
一个叫赛古拉的滑头是他的联系人
Keeps a greasy little bastard of a contact called Segurra.

266
00:15:50,530 --> 00:15:52,110
我见过他  没打招呼
I saw him. We didn't meet.

267
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,530
没关系
Wouldn't bother.

268
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:55,030
理都不要理他
Piss on the make.

269
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:57,990
赛古拉那小子秉性不善
The boy, Segurra, is at the property wickedness.

270
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:00,870
我不知道桑德森适合干哪行
I'm not sure where Sanderson fits.

271
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,250
不过桑德森值得培养
But Sanderson's worth cultivation.

272
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:04,460
他有不错的人脉
He's got some good connections.

273
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:06,250
对自由记者有些帮助
He's good for some freelance.

274
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:11,380
今晚我被这里弄得太郁闷了
This place is depressing me beyond belief tonight.

275
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:13,590
你是住仙都酒店吧
You're at Plage Xanadu, right?

276
00:16:15,050 --> 00:16:16,470
来吧  我送你回去
Come on. I'll give you a ride.

277
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:37,410
我在想  要是你想找住处
I was thinking, if you need somewhere,

278
00:16:37,490 --> 00:16:39,240
我有间房可以租给你
I got a room for rent.

279
00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:43,080
地段不算好  不过有冰箱和电视
Not the best address in town, but it's got a fridge and TV.

280
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:44,460
每月六十
60 a month.

281
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:46,750
听着不错  我考虑一下
Sounds inviting. I might remention that.

282
00:16:46,830 --> 00:16:48,590
现在花老板的钱别心疼
Meanwhile, bleed it dry.

283
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:00,430
先生
Uh, sir...

284
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:02,810
我想游泳
I was hoping for a swim.

285
00:17:02,890 --> 00:17:04,430
泳池今晚关闭
The pool is closed tonight.

286
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:06,350
是吗  为什么  怎么了
Really? Why? What's going on?

287
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:08,770
联碳公司有个派对
It's a Union Carbide party.

288
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:10,270
私人晚会
It's a private function.

289
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,490
不好意思
Sorry.

290
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,700
我没注意到船上有人
I didn't realize anyone was there.

291
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:05,910
还以为是漂过来的
I thought it was just floating.

292
00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:08,170
就是漂过来的
It is just floating.

293
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:10,630
你和我一样吗
You doing what I'm doing?

294
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,170
不一样吧
I don't think so.

295
00:18:13,670 --> 00:18:14,880
你在干什么
What are you doing?

296
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:17,340
离开乏味的派对
Escaping the dreadful party.

297
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:19,970
悄悄溜出来裸泳
I just snuck out and unzipped.

298
00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:23,220
你可真勇敢
Well, that's very courageous of you.

299
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,270
我还当你是条美人鱼呢
I thought maybe you were a mermaid.

300
00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:28,440
人们说海边有很多美人鱼
They tell me the coast is infested with them.

301
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,190
我来自康涅狄格州
I'm from Connecticut.

302
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:33,020
我男朋友正在演讲
My boyfriend's making a speech.

303
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:35,360
正好二十一分钟的演讲
Takes exactly 21 minutes.

304
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,610
现在说请你喝杯酒
Well, then I guess it's pointless,

305
00:18:36,690 --> 00:18:38,570
是不是没意义
me inviting you for a drink.

306
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:40,280
你有什么酒
What you got?

307
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:42,120
这里没有  我是说去酒吧
No, I mean at the bar.

308
00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:46,450
是没意义
Pointless.

309
00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:50,040
我还是趁他们找我之前回去
I'd better go before they wonder where I went.

310
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:54,290
等等  你叫什么
Wait a minute. What's your name?

311
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:56,760
当成个秘密吧
Let's keep that a secret.

312
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:58,470
我还不知道呢
I don't even know it.

313
00:18:58,550 --> 00:19:00,220
那就更秘密了
Well, then you'll keep it even better.

314
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:01,800
你什么星座
What about your star sign?

315
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:03,970
我是个资深天文学家
I'm an experienced astronomer.

316
00:19:04,890 --> 00:19:06,220
没准是双鱼吧
Could try Pisces.

317
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:07,930
鱼
The fish.

318
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:11,650
天呐
Oh, God.

319
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:13,900
为什么她就出现了
Why did she have to happen?

320
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:17,110
明明还是心如止水  偏偏却冒出个她
Just when I was doing so good without her.

321
00:19:18,570 --> 00:19:20,700
二位最喜欢波多黎各什么
What would you say you like most about Puerto Rico?

322
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:23,450
保龄球馆和赌场
The bowling alleys and the casinos.

323
00:19:23,910 --> 00:19:25,530
当然  她喜欢的是免税
Course, she likes the duty free.

324
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:27,790
你花的越多  省的就越多
Well, the more you spend, the more you save.

325
00:19:27,870 --> 00:19:29,620
在岛上四处观光了吗
Have you seen a lot of the island?

326
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:32,120
我们就没离开酒店
We don't leave the hotel.

327
00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:33,960
不安全啊
It isn't safe.

328
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,040
可玩得很开心吧
But you're having fun?

329
00:19:35,130 --> 00:19:37,750
是啊  非常开心  太爽了
Oh, yeah! A lotta, lotta fun!

330
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:41,680
跟他妈傻胖子寻开心
Have some fun with a fucking Luger.

331
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:44,510
球馆很能吸引这帮吃货
These alleys are magnets to the glutton.

332
00:19:45,390 --> 00:19:47,260
他们犹如过江之鲫
They come off the boats like locusts.

333
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,430
一帮肥硕的猪头
Beasts of obesity.

334
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:53,980
屁股中箭都感觉不到
Asses that wouldn't feel an arrow.

335
00:19:56,110 --> 00:19:57,610
伟大的白种人
The great whites.

336
00:19:58,150 --> 00:20:00,490
也许就是地球上最危险的物种
Probably the most dangerous creatures on Earth.

337
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:14,040
你的明星来了
There's your baby.

338
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:15,330
沃尔特和他妻子
Walt and his woman.

339
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:18,210
保龄球馆并不是我想的那样
Bowling alleys isn't exactly what I had in mind.

340
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,880
等冬天过了再看看吧
Tread it till the snow melts,

341
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:21,380
跟着大批的游客散去
then join the exodus.

342
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:23,800
在冲片子
Red light!

343
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:25,390
找坎普
Looking for Kemp.

344
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:29,720
形容词过多  过于尖酸刻薄
Too many adjectives, too much cynicism.

345
00:20:29,810 --> 00:20:31,560
没人想知道这里的问题
Nobody wants what's wrong with the place,

346
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:33,100
人们要看这里好的一面
they want to read about what's right.

347
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:34,730
-这是二稿  -知道  我看出来了
- It's a rewrite. - Yeah, I'm aware of that.

348
00:20:34,810 --> 00:20:36,480
等你改的时候
And while you're at it,

349
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:38,570
最好重新拟一个标题  叫
you might want to rewrite the title and call it

350
00:20:38,650 --> 00:20:40,860
《波多黎各之十大最爱》
"Ten Things That I Love About Puerto Rico."

351
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,320
那么
So,

352
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:49,950
酒戒得怎么样了
how's the sobriety coming along?

353
00:20:50,910 --> 00:20:52,250
正在减量
I'm cutting down.

354
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:55,620
你的意思是  你不喝大瓶改喝小瓶了吧
Oh. By that, I assume you mean the size of the bottles.

355
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:01,500
你怎么喝的161瓶朗姆酒
How does anybody drink 161 miniatures?

356
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:04,420
你平均一个星期喝93瓶啊
You're averaging 93 miniatures a week.

357
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:06,590
酒店是不是一天得给你补充四次
What, do they stock the place four times a day?

358
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:07,840
朗姆酒供应不是免费的吗
Are they not complimentary?

359
00:21:07,930 --> 00:21:09,260
是的  坎普先生  不是免费的
No, Mr. Kemp, they are not.

360
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:11,560
葡萄酒和长途电话同样也不是
And neither is wine and long-distance phone calls.

361
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:15,390
到下周一  你就给我搬出仙都
So, as of Monday, you are no longer a resident of the Xanadu.

362
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:17,650
什么风把你给吹来了
And what exactly brings you into the building?

363
00:21:17,730 --> 00:21:18,770
别烦我
Don't hazel me.

364
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:21,650
我拿到X光片了  我活不过一个星期了
I got the X-rays back. I got less than a week to live.

365
00:21:21,730 --> 00:21:24,280
烦你  你在胡说什么  你个瑞典佬
Hazel you? What are you talking about, you Swedish twerp?

366
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:27,530
你那快烂光的脑子里想过没
You know, it may have crossed what's left of your mind

367
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:29,160
我这里是办报纸的
that I have a newspaper to run here,

368
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:32,160
外面那些事叫新闻
that we have something called news going on out there.

369
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:33,790
但是与其等着你报道新闻
But as far as you're concerned,

370
00:21:33,870 --> 00:21:36,210
我还不如自己亲自看
I might as well look out of the fuckin' window!

371
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:38,120
你来这儿干吗
What are you doing here?

372
00:21:38,210 --> 00:21:39,290
这里是报社
This is a newspaper.

373
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:40,460
没你需要的东西
There's nothing here for you.

374
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:42,420
你以前两条最棒的独家新闻
Two of the best scoops you ever had

375
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:44,090
都是我想出来的
came out of my brain.

376
00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:46,050
你说话最好注意点
And you better moderate your language

377
00:21:46,130 --> 00:21:47,340
不然我可去别处了
or I'll go elsewhere.

378
00:21:47,430 --> 00:21:48,550
别处  哪里的别处
Elsewhere where?

379
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,550
苍蝇你都拍不死
You couldn't get work as a fly repellent.

380
00:21:50,930 --> 00:21:52,310
你简直一无是处  莫伯格
You're worthless, Moburg.

381
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:54,310
毫无利用价值
The last onion in the jar.

382
00:21:54,390 --> 00:21:56,520
别逼我  罗特曼
Don't push me, Lotterman.

383
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:57,980
狗急了也会跳墙的
I'm dangerous when pushed.

384
00:21:58,060 --> 00:21:59,690
我知道你为什么来了
Oh, I know why you're here.

385
00:21:59,770 --> 00:22:01,230
今天发工资嘛
It's payday.

386
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,320
但是你
But in your case,

387
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,650
再也领不到工资了
deferred on a permanent basis.

388
00:22:03,730 --> 00:22:04,820
你已经被解雇了
You're fired!

389
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:06,320
你不能解雇我
You can't fire me.

390
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,740
你还欠我工资呢
You owe me money.

391
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:10,320
你最好发给我  不然把我惹急了
And you better pay it, or I'll come through the roof

392
00:22:10,410 --> 00:22:12,700
我把你这变成保险公司
and turn this place into an insurance claim.

393
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:14,120
你是在威胁我吗
Are you threatening me?

394
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,540
大家都冷静点吧
Hey, guys, let's take it easy.

395
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:17,460
你想体验一下被巫毒诅咒的滋味吗
You want to suffer some voodoo?

396
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:18,710
你个疯子
You twerp!

397
00:22:18,790 --> 00:22:20,580
吃招吧  罗特曼
Eat the death pill, Lotterman!

398
00:22:21,670 --> 00:22:23,380
走  咱不跟他计较
Come on, we're walking.

399
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:25,420
你听见他对我说什么了吗
Did you hear what he said to me?

400
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:27,170
我这高血压就是拜他所赐
This guy's my blood pressure.

401
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:28,760
早晚我要死在他手下
This guy's going to kill me.

402
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:32,550
那张照片的底片必须给我毁掉
And I want the negative of that picture destroyed!

403
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:36,390
别让那蠢货再进来
I don't want that animal in this building again.

404
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,180
看着就恶心
He is hygienically unacceptable.

405
00:22:38,770 --> 00:22:40,230
你看见他鼻子那儿了吗
Did you see the side of his nose?

406
00:22:40,310 --> 00:22:41,730
密密麻麻的黑头跟盲文似的
Blackheads like Braille.

407
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:43,650
他们应该直接抓他
They should have him put down.

408
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:46,860
莫伯格绝对是个人物
Moburg is history.

409
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:49,110
我们一招到人他马上滚蛋
He's out of here at the earliest opportunity.

410
00:22:50,990 --> 00:22:53,070
而这个人
And the earliest opportunity

411
00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:56,370
就是你
is you.

412
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,120
你明白我在说什么吗  坎普
You understand what I'm saying, Kemp?

413
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:01,040
我想我明白
I think I get the drift.

414
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:03,290
我希望你能全身心地投入到我们的报纸中
I want you to immerse yourself into this paper,

415
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:05,550
因为你有才华  我觉得你也有这份心
'cause you got the talent and I think you got the will.

416
00:23:05,630 --> 00:23:07,880
你可以随报社一起发展
You make it grow and you grow right along with it.

417
00:23:09,010 --> 00:23:10,680
我恐怕做不了
I'm not best placed to do that.

418
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:12,470
你觉得我招你来就是让你负责星座
You think it's my intention to keep you on

419
00:23:12,550 --> 00:23:14,180
和保龄球板块  每天润色润色新闻吗
horoscopes and rewrites and bowling alleys?

420
00:23:15,810 --> 00:23:18,350
其实  我马上就给你任务
Matter of fact, I'm gonna move you right now.

421
00:23:19,730 --> 00:23:22,560
打的去机场
Take a cab to the airport.

422
00:23:23,270 --> 00:23:24,980
迈阿密的市长就要来访问了
The mayor of Miami's coming in.

423
00:23:26,150 --> 00:23:27,690
让他说点好听的
Make him sound nice.

424
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,070
我要你给他拍照  采访他
I want a picture and an interview.

425
00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:31,490
只准成功不许失败  保罗
Make it work, Paul.

426
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:53,180
你已经不在我的酒店住了吗
You leaving us already?

427
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:55,820
如果这位市长真能出现的话
I'm moving into an apartment

428
00:23:55,830 --> 00:23:57,180
我就可以去住公寓了
if this mayor guy ever shows up.

429
00:23:58,350 --> 00:24:00,520
机场公告牌上显示的一直是  航班延误
They keep changing "Delayed" To "Delayed."

430
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,020
想去吃点早餐吗
You want to have some breakfast?

431
00:24:07,150 --> 00:24:08,480
在沙滩上来点小龙虾
Little lobster on the beach?

432
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,490
就20分钟的路
Twenty minutes away.

433
00:24:10,570 --> 00:24:12,200
听起来不错  不过我得在这里等市长
Sounds inviting, but I got to wait for the mayor.

434
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:13,950
不会来啦
Isn't coming.

435
00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:15,070
航班取消
Canceled.

436
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:17,330
公告牌上可不是这么写的
That's not what it says on the board.

437
00:24:17,410 --> 00:24:18,870
马上就改
It will in a minute.

438
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:20,080
我刚刚给迈阿密打过电话
I just called Miami.

439
00:24:20,450 --> 00:24:22,500
走吧  吃点儿早餐
Come on, let's have some breakfast.

440
00:24:23,370 --> 00:24:25,080
我那有些你感兴趣的东西
I got a couple of things that might interest you.

441
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:28,210
我得打电话汇报一下
I better call in.

442
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,340
车上打
You can call from the car.

443
00:24:40,850 --> 00:24:42,310
好的  知道了  谢谢
All right. Yeah, thanks.

444
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,650
在波多黎各只有两个这样的地方
There's only two of those on the island.

445
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:50,730
顶多三个
Maybe three.

446
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:53,860
没人告诉我这里这么美
No one told me it was so pretty here.

447
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,910
上帝赐予的财富
God's idea of money.

448
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:02,660
你知道这里因为什么叫金矿吗
You know what makes this place a gold mine?

449
00:25:03,790 --> 00:25:05,330
因为有别处稀缺的东西
Something that doesn't exist.

450
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:06,460
此话怎讲
How's that?

451
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:07,830
土地
Land.

452
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,750
因为土地稀缺
There isn't enough of it.

453
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:14,470
拥有土地就意味着掘到了金子
Those who know how to get it get the gold.

454
00:25:56,130 --> 00:25:57,300
香诺
Chenault?

455
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,480
保罗跟咱们一起吃早饭
Paul's joining us for breakfast.

456
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:08,140
差不多都成午饭了
Looks like it's gonna be a lunch.

457
00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:10,940
这是香诺
This is Chenault.

458
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,530
你们俩以前认识吗
You two know each other?

459
00:26:16,610 --> 00:26:19,160
不知道  可能在飞机上见过吧
I don't know, I thought maybe we met on the plane.

460
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:20,620
应该不会吧
Oh, I don't think so.

461
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:22,280
我坐的可是男朋友号专机
I flew Boyfriend Airlines.

462
00:26:22,830 --> 00:26:24,870
你喜欢龙虾吗  保罗
Tell me, do you like lobster, Paul?

463
00:26:25,330 --> 00:26:26,750
那个  今天可能不行了
You know what, I might not have time today.

464
00:26:26,830 --> 00:26:28,920
我不知道开车来得这么长时间
I didn't realize the drive was gonna take so long.

465
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
你还有多长时间
How much time you got?

466
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,830
还有15分钟  再晚就迟到了
In 15 minutes, I'm late.

467
00:26:32,170 --> 00:26:33,750
我去切个菠萝
I'll cut up a pineapple.

468
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:36,300
你还是穿上点衣服吧
You might want to put on some clothes.

469
00:26:38,010 --> 00:26:39,840
她习惯脱了衣服晒日光浴
She sunbathes in the nude.

470
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:41,680
当地这些人把看她
A few of the over-tanned locals

471
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:44,100
当成是吸引游客的卖点
tend to treat it as a tourist attraction.

472
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:45,600
谁说不是呢
Doesn't surprise me.

473
00:26:45,890 --> 00:26:48,060
我是说  这样的确很有品味
I mean that in a... In a very tasteful way.

474
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:49,600
这里是私人海滩
It's a private beach.

475
00:26:49,690 --> 00:26:50,940
外人不应该来
They shouldn't be here.

476
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:53,360
坐吧  保罗  待会儿给你叫辆计程车
Sit down, Paul, sit down. We'll grab you a cab.

477
00:26:57,030 --> 00:26:58,900
它叫哈利
His name's Harry.

478
00:26:59,410 --> 00:27:01,360
一本书给的灵感
Got the idea from a book.

479
00:27:02,950 --> 00:27:04,490
保罗  我想跟你谈谈
Paul, I wanted to talk,

480
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:07,410
因为我在找一个能
because I'm looking for someone who can

481
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:11,540
整合对立的观点
assimilate contradictory points of view

482
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:13,330
让大家统一口径的人
and make them into one voice.

483
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,300
你是个小说家  是吧
You're a novelist, right?

484
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:16,960
你听谁说的
Who told you that?

485
00:27:17,050 --> 00:27:19,340
得了吧  报纸不就是写八卦的吗
Oh, please. Newspapers are full of gossip.

486
00:27:19,550 --> 00:27:20,540
我刚想找一个擅长文字的人
I'm looking for someone

487
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:22,470
你马上就出现了
who's good with words, next day, you turn up.

488
00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:23,850
我相信运气
And 'cause I believe in good luck,

489
00:27:23,930 --> 00:27:25,470
没准你就是好运气
I thought maybe you were it.

490
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:27,270
我需要的
What I need

491
00:27:28,350 --> 00:27:30,440
是一双敏锐的眼睛
is someone with the right kind of eyes.

492
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:32,940
用来观察什么
For looking at what?

493
00:27:33,690 --> 00:27:35,400
观察这个
Looking at that.

494
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:41,280
金钱的海洋
An ocean of money.

495
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:55,840
你来啦
Hey, you made it.

496
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:57,840
走廊尽头那间
Door at the end.

497
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:03,930
再等我两分钟
Hey. Just give me two minutes.

498
00:28:04,430 --> 00:28:05,800
进去吧
Walk right in.

499
00:28:05,930 --> 00:28:07,100
好
All right.

500
00:29:11,790 --> 00:29:14,580
我本来想在你来之前把这里收拾收拾的
I was trying to get the place shipshape before you arrived.

501
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,080
阿道夫・希特勒演讲集
Adolf Hitler Speaks?

502
00:29:16,170 --> 00:29:18,840
不是我的  纳粹那些东西都是莫伯格的
Not mine. Nazi stuff belongs to Moburg.

503
00:29:19,170 --> 00:29:20,380
莫伯格也在这里住吗
Moburg lives here?

504
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,880
他把工装放在这里
He keeps his uniform here.

505
00:29:22,970 --> 00:29:25,470
不过我整月的见不到他
I never see him from one month's end to the next.

506
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:30,970
瞧瞧  这里还是很宽敞的
So, you can see, it's quite spacious.

507
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:33,270
厨房就别看了
Don't look in the kitchen.

508
00:29:33,350 --> 00:29:35,350
停水了  水阀坏了
The water's off. There's a problem with the valve.

509
00:29:36,350 --> 00:29:38,100
我记得你说你有个电视
Thought you said you had a TV.

510
00:29:38,190 --> 00:29:40,190
我是说我有电视看
I said I kind of have a TV.

511
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:47,700
巷子对面的人有电视  我有望远镜
The guy across the alley has a TV, I have binoculars.

512
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,280
他老婆是个聋子
His wife's deaf.

513
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:51,660
要是开着窗户  什么都听得清
With the window open, you hear every word.

514
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:53,870
来了
Oh, here it comes.

515
00:29:53,950 --> 00:29:55,330
来水了
Water's coming up.

516
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:58,000
我看见卧室里有几只鸡
I, uh, noticed you had some chickens in the bedroom.

517
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:59,130
是小公鸡
Cockerels.

518
00:29:59,210 --> 00:30:00,460
瞧我热得我都冒油了
Yeah, I'm sweating the grease out.

519
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:02,630
别担心  我把它们弄到我屋里
Don't worry about them, I'm moving them to my room.

520
00:30:02,710 --> 00:30:03,800
你要这些鸡做什么
What do you do with them?

521
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:05,050
-养了吃吗  -吃
- You eat them? - Eat them?

522
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:08,220
不  我才不吃呢
Nah. I don't eat them.

523
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:27,530
加油  宝贝  加油啊
Come on, baby, come on!

524
00:30:27,610 --> 00:30:29,360
干它  干它
Get in there, get in there!

525
00:30:29,450 --> 00:30:30,490
快
Come on!

526
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:49,130
乘胜追击啊  宝贝  乘胜追击
Hey, on a trade wind, my boy! On a trade wind!

527
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:50,430
来啊  加注啊  这才对嘛  鲍比
Come on, bump it up, there, Bobby.

528
00:30:50,510 --> 00:30:52,800
加注  加注  太明智了  先生
Bump, bump, bump, bump. Yes, sir!

529
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:22,520
他们管这只鸡叫怪兽
Hey. They call him El Monstruo.

530
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:25,190
三年了从没输过
Say he's never lost a fight in three years.

531
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:28,860
走  咱走吧
Come on, we're out of here.

532
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:33,990
来  快点  跟上
Come on, rapido, rapido.

533
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:40,200
过去  快
Come on. Come on. Go on.

534
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:05,900
那只鸡出现以前  我的鸡一直所向披靡
I tell you, we were on a roll til that thing turned up.

535
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:08,860
一共是217美元
That's $217.

536
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:10,150
不赖
Not bad.

537
00:33:10,230 --> 00:33:12,070
217美元算是一大笔钱了
$217 is a shitload of money.

538
00:33:12,150 --> 00:33:13,400
相对而言不算多
Relatively a shitload.

539
00:33:13,490 --> 00:33:15,360
训练这些鸡也很费钱的
They're expensive to train.

540
00:33:15,450 --> 00:33:18,660
我见过有些人在北海滩赢两千甚至一万的
I've seen guys win 2,000, ten on North Beach.

541
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:20,240
一万
10,000?

542
00:33:20,330 --> 00:33:22,370
那人为什么不去那里比赛
Why didn't he take El Monstruo down there?

543
00:33:22,450 --> 00:33:25,580
北海滩那边是上流社会
You're talking the environs of the Hilton Hotel.

544
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:27,670
人都戴领结  穿锃亮的皮鞋
They wear bowties and shiny shoes.

545
00:33:27,750 --> 00:33:29,590
他那种人是去不了的
There's no hope for his kind of hat.

546
00:33:31,890 --> 00:33:33,890
总统竞选电视辩论  尼克松VS肯尼迪

547
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:35,510
所以说  问题不在于目标
The question, again, is not one of goals.

548
00:33:35,590 --> 00:33:36,630
我们有目标
We're for those goals.

549
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:37,760
问题在于方法
It's one of means.

550
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:39,930
你是说艾森豪威尔政府
Were you claiming that the Eisenhower administration...

551
00:33:40,470 --> 00:33:43,770
这场闹剧什么时候才能结束
How long can this blizzard of shame go on?

552
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:47,810
看看这个忘恩负义的人  还义正辞严的
Look at this ingrate besotted with his own righteousness.

553
00:33:49,270 --> 00:33:51,020
黑肤色不过是深色的白皮肤
Black is a very dark shade of white.

554
00:33:51,110 --> 00:33:53,110
谢谢您的回答  尼克松先生
Well, thank you very much, Mr. Nixon.

555
00:33:54,490 --> 00:33:56,400
我听不下去了
I can't listen to any more of this.

556
00:33:56,490 --> 00:33:57,780
他一句话八个谎
Lies like he breathes.

557
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:01,120
真难想象撒一辈子谎是什么样
Imagine spending your entire life lying.

558
00:34:01,450 --> 00:34:02,740
上帝
Holy Christ.

559
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:05,080
没有比这更糟的
Never got worse.

560
00:34:05,910 --> 00:34:10,330
比他更糟糕的只有  有一天
The only eventuality worse than him is you know that one day,

561
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:13,210
某个臭婊子出现
some filthy whore-beast is gonna show up,

562
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:14,920
把他变成个民主派
make him look like a liberal.

563
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:18,300
尼克松唯一的优点是他肯定赢不了
The only upside with Nixon is he ain't gonna win.

564
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:20,140
他有微笑他自豪
He's got the grin.

565
00:34:20,220 --> 00:34:21,390
他赢不了
He ain't gonna win.

566
00:34:22,390 --> 00:34:24,390
肯尼迪  爱尔兰移民后裔

567
00:34:21,470 --> 00:34:23,010
爱尔兰人会赢
Irish guy's going to win.

568
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:24,890
不过他也活不长久
But they'll never let him live.

569
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:27,600
你怎么知道
How do you know that?

570
00:34:28,270 --> 00:34:29,650
我研究死亡运势
I do "Horror-scopes."

571
00:34:32,730 --> 00:34:34,570
不是说他从不来吗
Thought you said he never came here.

572
00:34:36,030 --> 00:34:37,070
他弄到过滤器了
He's got filters.

573
00:34:37,150 --> 00:34:38,360
什么过滤器
What filters?

574
00:34:39,870 --> 00:34:42,280
他翻墙摸进巴卡第的酿酒厂
He goes over the wall at the Barcardi plant.

575
00:34:42,370 --> 00:34:46,910
过滤是蒸馏的最后一道工序
These filters are the last in line in the distillation process.

576
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,210
机器里边的酒精含量比火箭燃料里面的还多
They contain more ethanol than rocket fuel.

577
00:34:51,290 --> 00:34:52,330
什么感觉
What's it like?

578
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:54,090
飘飘欲仙
A hand on the brain.

579
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:55,840
远离尘世
Off the scale.

580
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:57,590
470度
470 proof.

581
00:34:57,670 --> 00:34:59,630
哪有470度的酒
No such thing as 470 proof alcohol.

582
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:06,970
你可不能说得这么绝对
Certainty you might be required to moderate.

583
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:12,610
此处禁止吸烟
No smoking in the extraction area, if you please.

584
00:35:12,690 --> 00:35:14,020
开玩笑
Don't be ridiculous.

585
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:28,620
对酒鬼来说就是不行
Not for the social drinker.

586
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:31,870
想爽几口吗
You want to quaff?

587
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:33,130
不了
No.

588
00:35:33,210 --> 00:35:34,960
现在不行  我有东西要写
Not right now. I got to write.

589
00:35:35,050 --> 00:35:36,170
马上就得交稿
I got a deadline.

590
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:38,050
他在写什么
Oh, what's he writing?

591
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:41,010
他在质疑美国梦
He's lifting the stone on the American Dream.

592
00:35:41,090 --> 00:35:42,260
瓜雅尼拉海湾[波多黎各海湾]
Guayanilla Bay.

593
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:44,760
是啊  那里正乱着呢
Oh, yeah. It's bad down there.

594
00:35:45,470 --> 00:35:48,680
这样的话题没几个人感兴趣
You might find such a topic attracts a limited readership.

595
00:35:48,890 --> 00:35:50,180
有人看就行
Only need one.

596
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:52,060
罗特曼看就够了
Taking it to Lotterman.

597
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:54,980
是啊  刚没人祝你好运吧
Yeah. Oh, did I hear somebody say "Good luck"?

598
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:59,110
我今早去了
Yeah, I went down there this morning,

599
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:03,570
他想这么解雇我  蠢货一个
he unfired me on a temporary basis, maggot that he is.

600
00:36:03,910 --> 00:36:06,240
我想给罗特曼看样东西
I'd like to bring something in to Lotterman.

601
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:09,790
一把"干死你"霰弹枪
Like a slide-action, "Fuck you" Gun.

602
00:36:10,870 --> 00:36:12,750
别在这里喝
Don't drink that here.

603
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:17,170
我就尝一口  老伙计
Just a nipperoo, old boy.

604
00:36:17,250 --> 00:36:18,920
质量检测
Quality test.

605
00:36:20,630 --> 00:36:24,180
慢动作枪杀  就跟电影里似的
Man, slow-motion murder, just like they do in the movies.

606
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:27,220
看他被崩出去
See him flying back,

607
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:29,970
伸着胳膊乱扑腾
fuckin' arms flapping in the air.

608
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:32,270
好吧  混账东西
Okay, mother.

609
00:36:32,350 --> 00:36:35,560
盯着临死之前见到的这最后一张脸
Look upon the last face you'll see this side of hell!

610
00:36:35,810 --> 00:36:36,860
砰
Bam!

611
00:36:38,110 --> 00:36:40,690
他倒下了  血肉横飞
Down he goes, morsels of vital organs

612
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:43,490
七窍流血
spinning off into flesh orbit.

613
00:36:43,570 --> 00:36:44,820
砰
Bam!

614
00:36:44,910 --> 00:36:46,950
把他的屁眼嘣了
There goes his asshole.

615
00:36:47,030 --> 00:36:48,030
砰
Bam!

616
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:49,910
老二也没了
There goes his dick.

617
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:51,910
砰砰
Bam! Bam!

618
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:54,210
去死吧  罗特曼
Fuck you, Lotterman!

619
00:36:54,290 --> 00:36:58,130
这是部B级片  而我就是杀人机器
You're in a B-fucking movie, and I am the death machine!

620
00:37:01,630 --> 00:37:03,090
咱听希特勒的演讲吧
Shall we have some Adolf?

621
00:37:03,170 --> 00:37:04,380
别了
Definitely not.

622
00:37:04,470 --> 00:37:06,680
你赶紧忙你的去吧  莫伯格
On your way, on your way, Moburg.

623
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:08,470
我们这有客人要来
Hey, we're expecting guests.

624
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,510
我记得你说他在写书
I thought you said he was writing a book.

625
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:11,770
是说我在写文章
Said I was writing an essay.

626
00:37:11,850 --> 00:37:13,890
需要安静的环境
And it requires some shut mouth.

627
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:17,060
别把你的时间浪费在那些蠢货身上
Oh, don't waste your time on those junkyard losers.

628
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:20,400
这个国家建立在种族灭绝和奴隶制之上
This country was built on genocide and slavery.

629
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:22,530
先杀死当地所有的黑人
We killed all the black guys that were here,

630
00:37:22,610 --> 00:37:25,860
再运过来我们国家的黑人
and then we shipped in new black guys of our own,

631
00:37:25,950 --> 00:37:28,240
然后跟带一块肥皂似的  把基督教带过来
and then we brought in Jesus, like a bar of soap.

632
00:37:28,330 --> 00:37:29,410
我们走
Let's go.

633
00:37:29,490 --> 00:37:30,780
你心知肚明
You know it.

634
00:37:30,870 --> 00:37:33,040
我是宗教方面的记者
I am the religious correspondent.

635
00:37:33,870 --> 00:37:36,040
让你们那一套耶稣的理论滚蛋吧
Fuck off with your Jesus Police!

636
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:37,380
如果圣经是上帝写的
If the Bible's God's book,

637
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:39,040
他为什么不每人发一本呢
why didn't He give it to everyone?

638
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:45,110
我们在停车收费器上的投入
"We give more money to parking meters

639
00:37:45,110 --> 00:37:47,010
多于我们在孩子饮食上的投入
than we do to kids to eat."

640
00:37:47,090 --> 00:37:49,510
别那种眼神  我是做了调查的
Don't read me like that. I've done the research.

641
00:37:50,310 --> 00:37:52,310
1.2万吨的盐酸
12,000-ton rust bucket went down in the bay

642
00:37:52,390 --> 00:37:54,390
一桶桶地全倒进了海湾
full of hydrochloric acid.

643
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:55,890
海洋里的生物集体毙命
Killed off everything in the sea.

644
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:58,190
渔夫也死了  剩下孩子们以捡破烂为生
Killed off the fishermen. Their kids are picking garbage.

645
00:37:58,270 --> 00:37:59,650
好吧  别生气
All right, don't get angry.

646
00:37:59,730 --> 00:38:00,940
这件事的确很受关注
It's hot outside.

647
00:38:02,150 --> 00:38:03,230
来杯威士忌
You want a Scotch?

648
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:04,400
好
Yeah.

649
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:09,030
十年前  不  五年前
Ten years ago... Five. Five years ago,

650
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:11,080
我可能会告诉你继续关注
I might have said go after it.

651
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:13,740
现在我劝你视而不见
Now I say go with it.

652
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:15,790
你无能为力
There's nothing you can change.

653
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,790
有时你呕吐完了也只能接着划船
Sometimes you just got to spew over the side and keep rowing.

654
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:23,090
朝着坚果色的落日继续前进
Into a nut brown sunset.

655
00:38:24,210 --> 00:38:25,970
这是片充斥着愤怒的土地
It's the land of multiple outrage.

656
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:27,880
你醒来吃早饭的时候
Thousands trodden on

657
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:29,550
早有成千上万的人受到了践踏
before you wake up for breakfast.

658
00:38:30,510 --> 00:38:33,060
那不算是新闻  不过是商业现实
That isn't news, it's a commercial reality.

659
00:38:33,970 --> 00:38:35,720
而且这落日早就不是他们的了
And providing it isn't their sunset,

660
00:38:35,810 --> 00:38:38,640
谁他妈在乎呢
nobody gives one-fifth of a fuck.

661
00:38:38,730 --> 00:38:40,560
你低估你的读者了
You underestimate your readers.

662
00:38:40,650 --> 00:38:41,690
我不这样认为
I don't think so.

663
00:38:41,770 --> 00:38:43,480
你低估我了
You underestimate me.

664
00:38:43,730 --> 00:38:46,150
你让我好好干  而这就是我想做的
You told me to make it work, that's what I want to do.

665
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:48,650
停止星座那套废话  办真正的报纸
Wind down this La Zonga crap and make a newspaper.

666
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:50,320
让我告诉你一些不中听的真理
Let me tell you some home truth.

667
00:38:50,410 --> 00:38:51,800
从这份报纸诞生之日起
This paper's been on its knees to a bank

668
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:53,620
它就对东家银行言听计从
since the day it opened.

669
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:55,830
跟地球上所有报纸一样
And like most every other newspaper on Earth,

670
00:38:55,910 --> 00:38:57,330
经费来源是广告收入
it's financed by its advertising.

671
00:38:57,410 --> 00:38:59,620
没有广告的话  不仅没有星座
And without advertising, not only is there no La Zonga,

672
00:38:59,710 --> 00:39:01,580
连纸张都不会有  因此
there's no paper to put it in, so, thus,

673
00:39:01,670 --> 00:39:03,960
有那么一两种事情我们是不会报道的
there are one or two things that we don't write about.

674
00:39:04,250 --> 00:39:05,750
换句话说就是什么都不报道
In other words, nothing at all.

675
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:07,840
再换句话  这叫谨慎
In one other word, discretion.

676
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:09,680
你不是驻外记者
You're not a foreign correspondent

677
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:13,010
派驻在遥远的异国他乡  这里是美国
in some far-flung foreign land, this is America.

678
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:14,390
这里是波多黎各
This is Puerto Rico.

679
00:39:14,470 --> 00:39:16,850
是美国
This is America.

680
00:39:16,930 --> 00:39:19,180
你以为一个伊利诺伊诺莫尔市的水暖工
You think some plumber from Normal, Illinois,

681
00:39:19,270 --> 00:39:22,230
用辛苦攒了25年的积蓄来这里度假
saves up for 25 years to come here on a cruise ship

682
00:39:22,310 --> 00:39:24,860
是为了看糖料种植园如何陷入困境吗
to read about bad times in the sugar plantation?

683
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:26,860
他们才不管呢
They don't give a fuck!

684
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:28,530
一般人不会摇晃船身
The average guy don't rock the boat,

685
00:39:28,610 --> 00:39:30,320
因为他想爬上船来
'cause he wants to climb aboard it.

686
00:39:30,410 --> 00:39:33,070
而我们的读者就是这些一般人
And our readership is vividly average.

687
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:37,540
他们不关心谁是失败者
They don't care who the losers are.

688
00:39:37,620 --> 00:39:40,410
他们只在意胜利者
They want to know who won.

689
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:41,710
谁赢了球赛
Who won the bowls,

690
00:39:41,790 --> 00:39:44,880
谁赢了赛马  谁玩老虎机赚了
who won the races, who won the pot at the slot machines.

691
00:39:47,550 --> 00:39:49,260
看着我  坎普
Look at me, Kemp.

692
00:39:50,010 --> 00:39:52,010
你不是在睡觉  你清醒得很
You're not sleeping, you're wide awake.

693
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:54,600
而这就是美国梦
And this is the American Dream.

694
00:39:56,510 --> 00:39:59,020
这么多酒店  你都看不见海了
So many hotels, you can't see the sea.

695
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:01,270
只有住进酒店才能看见海景
You can see the sea by checking into the hotels.

696
00:40:01,350 --> 00:40:02,560
看海还得掏钱
Pay to see the sea?

697
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:04,440
这怎么了
What's the matter with that?

698
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:06,320
想呆在美国梦里  你就得付钱
You're paying to be in the dream.

699
00:40:08,150 --> 00:40:09,570
在梦境与现实之间  坎普
There's a thin veneer, Kemp,

700
00:40:09,650 --> 00:40:11,490
有一层薄板
between the dream and the reality.

701
00:40:11,740 --> 00:40:12,940
你要是把梦里的人弄醒了
You wake them up and the

702
00:40:12,940 --> 00:40:15,280
他们就要你退款
people might start asking for their money back.

703
00:40:21,750 --> 00:40:23,250
听你的
You're the boss.

704
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:26,170
不尽然
Not quite.

705
00:40:27,090 --> 00:40:30,840
这份报纸的社论立场由美国梦主导
The editorial policy of this newspaper is owned by the dream.

706
00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:22,390
天哪
Oh, God.

707
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:30,520
上帝
Oh, Christ.

708
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:38,950
瞧啊
Oh, God, look at that.

709
00:41:39,030 --> 00:41:42,160
天哪
Oh, God!

710
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:44,960
-豪尔  -啊?
- Hal? - Oh.

711
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:46,830
不不  我是豪尔的朋友
No, no, I'm a friend of Hal's.

712
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:49,000
我在欣赏他的游艇
I was looking at his boat.

713
00:41:49,090 --> 00:41:50,670
真是艘好船
She's a sweet little beauty.

714
00:41:50,750 --> 00:41:52,090
你坐过吗
You been aboard?

715
00:41:52,170 --> 00:41:53,340
没
No.

716
00:41:53,550 --> 00:41:54,840
极好的小岛旅行工具
Great little island hopper.

717
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:56,760
我们都坐过
We've all been down on her.

718
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:58,800
非常棒的经历
It's a wonderful experience.

719
00:42:05,350 --> 00:42:06,480
你们俩来得真早
You two are early.

720
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:07,600
收获颇丰啊
Oh, you got lucky.

721
00:42:07,690 --> 00:42:08,810
是啊
Yeah.

722
00:42:09,110 --> 00:42:10,110
相互介绍过了吗
Did you meet?

723
00:42:10,190 --> 00:42:11,820
是的  介绍了名字
Oh, yeah, we got first names.

724
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:14,940
阿特・金伯格  退役海军陆战队队员
Art Zimburger, late of the U.S. Marines,

725
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:15,900
我的好朋友
great friend of mine.

726
00:42:15,990 --> 00:42:18,530
保罗・坎普先生  纽约时报记者
This is Mr. Paul Kemp, New York Times.

727
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:19,870
你就是那个作者
Oh, you're the writer.

728
00:42:19,950 --> 00:42:21,330
-保罗是个小说家  -是嘛
- Paul's a novelist. - Uh-huh.

729
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:25,500
怎么成纽约时报了
New York Times?

730
00:42:25,580 --> 00:42:27,500
对他来说都不认得
He don't know one from the other.

731
00:42:27,580 --> 00:42:29,540
别纠结这个了  这个人是重点
Just go with it. This guy's key.

732
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:30,960
什么重点
Key to what?

733
00:42:31,630 --> 00:42:33,840
我们讨论的重点
Key to the discussion we're about to have.

734
00:42:37,550 --> 00:42:39,180
看看那些土著
Look at those mothers.

735
00:42:40,260 --> 00:42:42,180
跟我来  坎普
Come with me, Kemp.

736
00:42:43,510 --> 00:42:46,020
这是私人海滩
This is a private beach.

737
00:42:46,100 --> 00:42:47,310
我们没踏上海滩
We are not on it.

738
00:42:47,390 --> 00:42:49,140
你们是没有  但是我们在
No, but we are!

739
00:42:49,230 --> 00:42:51,150
我们的行动是隐私
And what we do is private!

740
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:54,230
马上给我滚
Now get the fuck gone!

741
00:42:57,240 --> 00:42:59,030
滚出这里
Get the fuck out of here!

742
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:00,570
再让我看到你
I see your face again,

743
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:03,620
一枪崩了你们
you're gonna have a 12-gauge shotgun telling you what to do.

744
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:14,800
说到撒旦
Talking about Satan...

745
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:18,380
苏联就是个满是撒旦的王国
if there ever was a kingdom of Satan, the Soviet Union is it.

746
00:43:19,180 --> 00:43:22,510
对付共产主义的唯一方法就是毁了它
The only way to come to terms with Communism is to destroy it.

747
00:43:23,220 --> 00:43:27,430
在它用民主浪潮打倒我们前打倒它
Hit it before it hits us in a devastating democratic strike.

748
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:29,100
别给少校倒了
No more for the major.

749
00:43:31,020 --> 00:43:32,690
需要有人来振臂一呼
They're looking for a man to push that button,

750
00:43:33,020 --> 00:43:34,440
我就是那个人
I am that man.

751
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:36,530
是的  就是你  亲爱的
Yes, you are, honey.

752
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:39,780
你真迷人  香诺
You look ravishing, Chenault.

753
00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:41,110
谢谢
Thank you.

754
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:42,240
我来解救你啦
You need rescuing?

755
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:43,740
别带走他
Oh, don't take him away.

756
00:43:43,830 --> 00:43:45,450
他很有趣
He's very entertaining.

757
00:43:46,580 --> 00:43:49,030
我们刚在讨论古巴  还有  我不知道
We were discussing Cuba and, I don't know,

758
00:43:49,030 --> 00:43:50,960
我们跑题了吧
we kind of veered off, didn't we?

759
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:53,420
保罗提出了一些自由派的观点
Paul presents us with a somewhat liberal point of view.

760
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:55,170
根本不存在自由主义者
There is no such thing as a liberal.

761
00:43:55,250 --> 00:43:56,620
自由主义者就是
A liberal is a Commie with

762
00:43:56,620 --> 00:43:58,920
念过大学  满脑子黑人思想的共产党员
a college education thinking Negro thoughts.

763
00:43:59,010 --> 00:44:01,130
举个例子
Well, here's a fact for you.

764
00:44:01,220 --> 00:44:05,720
76.4%的黑鬼是被莫斯科控制的
76.4% of all Negroes are controlled from Moscow.

765
00:44:05,970 --> 00:44:08,720
这就是为什么卡斯特罗能一帆风顺
That's why Castro gets such an easy ride.

766
00:44:08,810 --> 00:44:11,690
依我看  我们应该把古巴炸离地球
In my view, we ought to bomb Cuba off the face of the Earth,

767
00:44:11,770 --> 00:44:13,150
-让那的人民都安生  -阿特
- let its people live in peace. - Art.

768
00:44:13,230 --> 00:44:15,480
来吧  吃点东西
Hey. Come on, let's eat.

769
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:16,940
来吧
Come on.

770
00:44:21,860 --> 00:44:23,070
荫凉地里那个人是谁
Who's the guy in the shades?

771
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:24,990
赛古拉的爸爸
Segurra's Daddy.

772
00:44:25,070 --> 00:44:26,490
就是你要见的人
It's who you're waiting for.

773
00:44:28,290 --> 00:44:30,250
谢谢你送我玫瑰
Thank you for my roses.

774
00:44:31,910 --> 00:44:33,370
我还以为你没看到
I didn't think you noticed.

775
00:44:33,710 --> 00:44:35,080
我当然看到了
Of course I noticed.

776
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:40,840
保罗  来认识一下
Paul, would you mind joining us?

777
00:44:47,140 --> 00:44:48,180
你好  先生
How do you do, sir?

778
00:44:48,260 --> 00:44:49,470
-坎普先生  -见到你很高兴
- Mr. Kemp. - Nice to see you.

779
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:50,640
坎普先生
Mr. Kemp.

780
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:55,850
首先我想说
Let me just start by saying

781
00:44:55,940 --> 00:44:57,400
这完全是一个非正式聚会
this is a purely informal meeting.

782
00:44:57,480 --> 00:45:00,820
顺便说句  你不用担心罗特曼  好吗
And, incidentally, you don't worry about Lotterman, okay?

783
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:02,070
罗特曼
Lotterman?

784
00:45:02,150 --> 00:45:04,450
罗特曼和纽约时报有什么关系
What the hell's Lotterman got to do with the New York Times?

785
00:45:04,530 --> 00:45:06,530
坎普先生为很多报社撰稿
Mr. Kemp subs for a variety of newspapers.

786
00:45:06,620 --> 00:45:08,030
偶尔写写新闻报道
Occasionally, he writes for the news.

787
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:10,240
他业余时间做的事才是他的本职
What he does in his spare time is his affair.

788
00:45:10,330 --> 00:45:11,660
我喜欢这样
That's how I like it.

789
00:45:11,750 --> 00:45:13,290
我们想请你帮我们写点东西
We'd like you to do some writing for us.

790
00:45:13,370 --> 00:45:14,540
这我知道
So I gather.

791
00:45:14,620 --> 00:45:15,920
写什么
About what?

792
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,250
简而言之  我们想做一些事情
In a sentence, we want to set something up,

793
00:45:18,340 --> 00:45:20,420
让大众成为我们的朋友
and have the public as our friends.

794
00:45:20,510 --> 00:45:22,840
我们有很多种方法能办到
And there are a variety of ways we can do that.

795
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:26,890
我来告诉你
Let me tell you how this kind

796
00:45:26,970 --> 00:45:28,260
怎么做  保罗
of thing works, Paul.

797
00:45:28,350 --> 00:45:30,180
举个例子
Suppose, by way of example,

798
00:45:30,260 --> 00:45:32,560
假如你想把税收提高五个百分点
you wanted to put up taxes by five percent.

799
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:34,230
最明智的办法是
The smart way of doing it

800
00:45:34,310 --> 00:45:36,980
先提议涨十个百分点
is to float the idea of a ten percent hike.

801
00:45:37,060 --> 00:45:39,690
让他们咆哮  焦躁不安
Let them all shout about it, get themselves in a fuss,

802
00:45:39,770 --> 00:45:41,020
然后再给予适当的让步
then you offer concessions.

803
00:45:41,110 --> 00:45:43,070
涨七个百分点怎么样  没门  他们说
"How about seven percent?" "No way," They'll say.

804
00:45:43,150 --> 00:45:48,570
好吧  别伤感情  折中一下五个百分点
"All right, let's stay friends and make a compromise at five."

805
00:45:48,660 --> 00:45:49,660
赢啦
Bingo.

806
00:45:49,740 --> 00:45:51,080
他们觉得他们得到了点好处
They think they won something,

807
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:53,330
你得到了你预先希望的五个百分点
you get the five percent you wanted in the first place.

808
00:45:53,410 --> 00:45:55,250
房地产也是一样的道理
Same thing applies to real estate.

809
00:45:55,580 --> 00:45:57,420
你想建五幢房子
You want to build five houses,

810
00:45:57,500 --> 00:46:00,000
先提交五十幢的规划申请
you put in a planning application for 50.

811
00:46:00,710 --> 00:46:01,920
你想建几幢
How many do you want to build?

812
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,170
零
None.

813
00:46:03,710 --> 00:46:04,970
我们要建一家酒店
We want to build one hotel.

814
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:06,800
这全是酒店
Well, looking around this place,

815
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:08,680
好像没人在意吧
I don't think anyone would notice.

816
00:46:09,010 --> 00:46:10,300
不在这建
It isn't in this place.

817
00:46:10,390 --> 00:46:11,600
是在一个岛上
It's an island.

818
00:46:12,010 --> 00:46:15,310
由于一些敏感原因  现在还不想着手
Sensitive for a variety of reasons we don't want to get into now.

819
00:46:15,770 --> 00:46:18,230
没人希望度假天堂变得满地旅馆
Nobody wants a paradise choked with hotels, but

820
00:46:18,900 --> 00:46:21,520
但是大家最后会妥协  接受一家旅馆
everybody will be pleased to compromise at one.

821
00:46:21,690 --> 00:46:23,610
这就需要将一些关键性文章
This is going to require some clever writing

822
00:46:23,690 --> 00:46:25,530
放在关键性的位置
in various carefully placed articles.

823
00:46:26,490 --> 00:46:28,320
这种做法合法吗
Isn't that kind of thing illegal?

824
00:46:28,410 --> 00:46:29,870
要我说  坎普先生
If I may say, Mr. Kemp,

825
00:46:30,740 --> 00:46:32,620
这个说法可不太合适
that's an inappropriate comment.

826
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:34,830
岛在哪里
Where's the island?

827
00:46:34,910 --> 00:46:35,950
不能告诉你
Can't tell you.

828
00:46:36,040 --> 00:46:37,120
暂时不行
Not yet.

829
00:46:37,210 --> 00:46:39,790
小心驶得万年船  坎普先生
Discretion is paramount, Mr. Kemp.

830
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:42,250
如果你想要加入我们  你得签一些文件
If you want to join us, you'll have to sign some papers.

831
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:45,130
我们明天在豪尔的办公室开会
We're having a meeting tomorrow in Hal's office.

832
00:46:45,210 --> 00:46:46,380
如果你想加入
If you want to be part of what will be

833
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:49,380
这项激动人心的工程  来吧
a very exciting project, come along.

834
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:52,220
有个人开着一辆滑稽的小车来找保罗
There's a man outside in a funny little car for Paul.

835
00:46:53,390 --> 00:46:54,720
先生们  失陪了
Gentlemen, if you'll excuse me.

836
00:46:54,810 --> 00:46:56,310
我得先走了
I have to run.

837
00:47:02,360 --> 00:47:03,650
不留下来吗
Can't stay?

838
00:47:03,730 --> 00:47:06,230
我听说美人鱼会在月光下现身呢
I hear the mermaids come out in the moonlight.

839
00:47:12,700 --> 00:47:15,790
我一见到她  就知道
From the moment we met, I knew

840
00:47:15,870 --> 00:47:18,210
我们之间要发生点什么
there was going to be something between us.

841
00:47:18,540 --> 00:47:19,960
他是她未婚妻
It's called her fiance.

842
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:23,840
老天  我无可救药地越来越爱她
God, I'm so hopelessly and progressively in love.

843
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:26,090
不要把欲望错当成爱
Do not confuse love with lust,

844
00:47:26,170 --> 00:47:28,010
不要在酒醉的情况下做判断
nor drunkenness with judgment.

845
00:47:29,220 --> 00:47:30,260
需要我的建议吗
You want my advice?

846
00:47:30,340 --> 00:47:31,970
不  如果和她有关  我不需要建议
No. If it involves her, no, I don't.

847
00:47:32,050 --> 00:47:33,430
离她远点
Stay away from her.

848
00:47:33,510 --> 00:47:34,850
还有离桑德森远点
And stay away from Sanderson.

849
00:47:34,930 --> 00:47:36,140
别自不量力
You're way out of depth.

850
00:47:36,220 --> 00:47:39,140
我不支持桑德森和他那狗屁坑人的岛
I got no brief for Sanderson or his pissy rip-off island.

851
00:47:39,560 --> 00:47:42,520
我只想尝尝那苹果花般的口红和她做爱
I just want some apple blossom lipstick and fucks.

852
00:47:42,730 --> 00:47:44,520
绝对不可能
You are in total denial.

853
00:47:44,610 --> 00:47:45,820
她在和别人做爱
She's fucking someone else.

854
00:47:45,900 --> 00:47:47,530
-哦  -而且据我所知
- Oh! - And as I understand it,

855
00:47:47,610 --> 00:47:49,030
她快要和他结婚了
about to be married to him.

856
00:47:49,110 --> 00:47:50,650
啦啦啦啦啦啦
La-la-la-la-la-la!

857
00:47:50,740 --> 00:47:52,030
你根本没戏
You won't even make an invite.

858
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:55,490
我真不敢相信
I don't believe this.

859
00:47:55,950 --> 00:47:57,830
又回到刚开始的地方了
We're right back where we started.

860
00:47:57,830 --> 00:47:59,830
卡布隆斯咖啡馆  营业至午夜

861
00:47:58,620 --> 00:48:00,500
我们十分钟前路过
That is the same Cabrones we passed

862
00:48:00,580 --> 00:48:01,960
卡布隆斯了
ten minutes ago.

863
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:12,760
我们需要人指路
We need directions.

864
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:15,970
进去找点吃的吧
Let's get in there and get something to eat.

865
00:48:19,180 --> 00:48:20,430
别
No.

866
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:21,770
求你了  别
Please, no.

867
00:48:21,850 --> 00:48:23,730
我可没一整天待在沙滩上
I haven't spent all day on a beach

868
00:48:23,810 --> 00:48:25,770
和罪犯一起大嚼龙虾
munching lobster with criminals,

869
00:48:25,860 --> 00:48:27,070
我饿死了
and I'm starving.

870
00:49:05,730 --> 00:49:08,860
两瓶啤酒  两瓶朗姆酒  一份牛排
Two beers, two rums, one steak.

871
00:49:08,940 --> 00:49:09,980
厨房下班了
The kitchen is closed.

872
00:49:10,070 --> 00:49:11,740
好吧  那就两瓶啤酒  两瓶朗姆酒
All right then, two beers and two rums.

873
00:49:11,820 --> 00:49:13,400
还有一份牛排
And one steak.

874
00:49:13,490 --> 00:49:14,900
关门了  先生
Cerrado, Mister...

875
00:49:14,990 --> 00:49:17,240
那不是我的问题
Yeah, but let's not bother me with that.

876
00:49:17,330 --> 00:49:19,610
你们挂个牌子  上面说
You got a sign down there saying,

877
00:49:19,610 --> 00:49:22,370
营业至午夜  那我就要点牛排
"Food til midnight," And I want a steak.

878
00:49:27,290 --> 00:49:28,710
夹在中间的姑娘
Girl of the swamp.

879
00:49:29,750 --> 00:49:31,710
这提醒我了  我们得要一份地图
Which reminds me, we need a map.

880
00:49:32,050 --> 00:49:33,340
你知道我在想什么吗
You know what I think?

881
00:49:34,260 --> 00:49:36,180
我在想我们朗姆酒喝多了
I think we're drinking too much rum.

882
00:49:36,340 --> 00:49:37,640
没别的办法
There's no other way.

883
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:41,970
我眼前是两个烟灰缸和两个盐罐子
I'm getting double ashtray and double salt pot.

884
00:49:43,390 --> 00:49:45,440
你也有莫伯格的神眼了
You got a Moburg bifocal.

885
00:49:46,060 --> 00:49:47,560
天哪  太可恶了
Christ, this is heinous.

886
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:50,480
看上去肯定像个酒鬼
Imagine what it must be like to be an alcoholic.

887
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:52,570
两美元
$2.

888
00:49:53,110 --> 00:49:55,200
给钱  走人
You pay and you go.

889
00:49:55,570 --> 00:49:56,990
我没看到牛排
I don't see a steak.

890
00:49:57,620 --> 00:49:58,910
没有牛排
No steak.

891
00:49:58,990 --> 00:50:00,450
你什么意思  没有牛排
What do you mean, no steak?

892
00:50:01,080 --> 00:50:02,660
我想他的意思就是没有牛排
I think he means no steak.

893
00:50:03,750 --> 00:50:05,370
厨房下班了
The kitchen is closed.

894
00:50:05,460 --> 00:50:07,120
我没法给你上牛排
I got no way of serving you.

895
00:50:07,210 --> 00:50:10,670
听着  你不想听我说我倒霉的一天
Listen, you don't want to hear about my bad day,

896
00:50:10,750 --> 00:50:13,210
我也不想看你摆臭脸色
and I don't want no grave side out of you.

897
00:50:13,300 --> 00:50:16,340
你没法做熟就把生牛排端上来  我生吃
If you can't cook it, bring it like it is. I'll eat it raw.

898
00:50:16,430 --> 00:50:19,300
两美元  给钱  走人
Two dollars, you pay and go.

899
00:50:19,390 --> 00:50:20,800
别惹我
Don't bother me.

900
00:50:20,890 --> 00:50:23,430
赶紧给钱  不然我报警了
You pay now, or I call the cops.

901
00:50:23,930 --> 00:50:26,640
你要是根本不想给我上牛排
If you have no intention of serving me steak,

902
00:50:26,730 --> 00:50:29,100
就给我滚远点
why don't you do your best to fuck off.

903
00:50:45,580 --> 00:50:48,120
我感觉气氛很诡异
it seems to me there's a bad vibe developing.

904
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:51,460
那边有一两个怪人看我们的眼神不对劲
There are one or two oddities giving us the eye.

905
00:50:51,880 --> 00:50:53,090
别神经兮兮的
Don't get paranoid.

906
00:50:53,170 --> 00:50:54,550
他在打电话
He's on the phone.

907
00:50:54,670 --> 00:50:55,710
干嘛
For what?

908
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:57,050
在餐馆点东西吃也犯法啦
Ordering food in a restaurant?

909
00:50:57,130 --> 00:50:59,300
希望他打到联邦调查局去
Let's hope he's through to the FBI.

910
00:50:59,390 --> 00:51:00,510
警察局吗
Si, la policia?

911
00:51:04,270 --> 00:51:05,520
怎么了
What's the matter?

912
00:51:05,850 --> 00:51:07,390
你笑什么
What are you smiling at?

913
00:51:07,980 --> 00:51:09,390
我没笑啊
I'm not smiling.

914
00:51:09,980 --> 00:51:11,600
只是显得随和点
I'm maintaining a casual face.

915
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:17,110
有个人刚走进来
A man just walked in

916
00:51:17,190 --> 00:51:20,950
肯定把我们往坏处想了
and has good reason for regarding us in a negative light.

917
00:51:21,030 --> 00:51:22,320
-我们吗  -是我
- Us? - Me.

918
00:51:22,450 --> 00:51:24,240
他刚看到我了
And he's just seen me.

919
00:51:24,330 --> 00:51:27,200
他想找白人报仇
And he wants revenge on the white man.

920
00:51:28,410 --> 00:51:30,120
你在讲什么鬼话
The fuck are you talking about?

921
00:51:31,380 --> 00:51:33,130
脸上有条疤的那个人
How about the one with the dent?

922
00:51:36,170 --> 00:51:37,210
那个人的眼神
The one with the eye?

923
00:51:37,300 --> 00:51:38,380
正是
The very same.

924
00:51:39,930 --> 00:51:41,510
我们是走还是跑
Do we walk or run?

925
00:51:42,430 --> 00:51:43,510
走
Walk.

926
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:45,010
我去推车
I'll push the car.

927
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:55,190
我们走  希望他今天心情不错
Let's walk and hope he's happy.

928
00:52:09,870 --> 00:52:11,660
美国佬
Hey, Yankee.

929
00:52:11,750 --> 00:52:13,120
美国佬
Yankee!

930
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:35,360
别让我看到车灯
Don't let me see headlights.

931
00:52:36,730 --> 00:52:38,530
别让我看到车灯
Please don't let me see headlights.

932
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:41,860
我看到车灯了
I just seen headlights.

933
00:52:42,990 --> 00:52:44,110
踩油门
Put your foot down.

934
00:52:44,200 --> 00:52:46,070
我踩的就是油门
Where exactly do you think I got it?

935
00:52:56,250 --> 00:52:57,750
不能开快点吗
Can you go faster?

936
00:52:57,840 --> 00:52:59,090
已经最快了
Going fast as I can.

937
00:53:19,780 --> 00:53:21,820
老天
Jesus Christ, man.

938
00:53:44,510 --> 00:53:46,800
我们要死了  我们要死了
We're gonna be killed! We're gonna be killed!

939
00:53:58,560 --> 00:54:00,060
准备好跑路
Get ready to run.

940
00:54:00,150 --> 00:54:01,360
朝相反方向跑
Run in opposite directions.

941
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:02,440
酒给我
Give me the brew!

942
00:54:02,530 --> 00:54:03,610
把酒给我
Give me the fucking brew!

943
00:54:23,170 --> 00:54:24,380
保罗
Paul!

944
00:54:47,860 --> 00:54:50,570
运气不错  我刚看到莫伯格
Piece of luck. I just saw Moburg.

945
00:54:51,030 --> 00:54:52,660
估计他也看到我们了
At least I think he saw us.

946
00:54:55,080 --> 00:54:57,540
他们搞了个夜间法庭
They got some kind of night court going.

947
00:55:11,470 --> 00:55:13,810
他说我们是畜生
He says we were animals

948
00:55:13,890 --> 00:55:17,100
大耍酒疯  暴怒狂躁
on a rampage of drunken anarchy,

949
00:55:17,180 --> 00:55:19,310
向他们的一个警察泼汽油
poured gasoline on one of his cops.

950
00:55:25,230 --> 00:55:27,030
老天  我们完了
Oh, my God, we're doomed.

951
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:28,820
你们还有什么话好说
You have something to say?

952
00:55:30,490 --> 00:55:32,570
是的  法官大人  我有话说
Yes, Your Honor, I do.

953
00:55:33,410 --> 00:55:37,870
首先跟我靠在一起的这个  我根本没见过
Firstly, this guy handcuffed to me, I never seen in my life.

954
00:55:38,910 --> 00:55:42,580
其次  我们需要翻译指控
And second, we'd like a translation of the charges.

955
00:55:42,670 --> 00:55:43,960
你听到他们说什么了
You heard what they said?

956
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:47,460
无意冒犯  我听到的是西班牙语
With respect, I heard people speaking Spanish.

957
00:55:48,260 --> 00:55:49,390
你觉得这个国家
What kind of language do

958
00:55:49,390 --> 00:55:51,430
是说什么语的  先生
you think we speak in this country, Mister?

959
00:55:58,060 --> 00:55:59,100
他和我们不是一起的
He's not with us.

960
00:55:59,350 --> 00:56:01,940
警察带他去定罪
The cops attached him to get a conviction.

961
00:56:02,900 --> 00:56:05,650
你是否没付钱就离开卡布隆斯咖啡馆了
Did you leave the Cafe Cabrones without paying?

962
00:56:07,690 --> 00:56:10,700
你是否对警官纵火  有还是没有
Did you set fire to the police officer, yes or no?

963
00:56:10,780 --> 00:56:13,030
不幸的是  法官大人  是他自己闯进火里的
Unfortunately, Your Honor, he got in the way of our flame.

964
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:14,320
没错
That's right.

965
00:56:14,410 --> 00:56:17,620
我们不可能向他头上浇汽油还大笑
No way did we pour gasoline on his head and laugh as we did.

966
00:56:18,870 --> 00:56:19,870
不是像他说的那样
it wasn't like he said.

967
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:21,330
像他说的那样
Like he said?

968
00:56:21,460 --> 00:56:23,540
像你说的那样你不会说西班牙语
Like you say you don't speak Spanish.

969
00:56:23,630 --> 00:56:25,500
坎普先生不会说西班牙语
Mr. Kemp doesn't speak Spanish.

970
00:56:25,590 --> 00:56:27,800
那他有许多机会去学习了
Well, he will have plenty of opportunity to learn.

971
00:56:27,880 --> 00:56:29,630
对你们的指控可不轻
The charges against you are grave.

972
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:33,180
拘捕判处一年监禁
Resisting arrest carries a tariff alone of one year in prison.

973
00:56:33,260 --> 00:56:35,510
更不用说用致命性武器攻击了
Never mind assault with a deadly weapon.

974
00:56:36,140 --> 00:56:37,140
我要把这个案子
I'm going to refer this case

975
00:56:37,220 --> 00:56:38,560
提交高级法庭
to a higher court.

976
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:40,060
同时  还要拘留
Meanwhile, I remand you both

977
00:56:40,140 --> 00:56:41,480
你们两个30天
in custody for 30 days.

978
00:56:45,560 --> 00:56:46,900
容我插一句  法官大人
If I may, Your Honor.

979
00:56:57,790 --> 00:56:59,160
有话请讲  桑德森先生
Go ahead, Mr. Sanderson.

980
00:56:59,240 --> 00:57:00,540
谢谢  法官大人
Thank you, Your Honor.

981
00:57:00,620 --> 00:57:02,790
打断诉讼非我本意
It isn't my purpose to interrupt proceedings,

982
00:57:02,870 --> 00:57:06,580
但是若关系到关押两位先生
but if the intention is to remand these gentlemen,

983
00:57:06,670 --> 00:57:08,960
我恭敬地请求短暂休庭
I would respectfully ask for a brief recess

984
00:57:09,050 --> 00:57:10,760
允许我联系两人的律师
to allow me to contact their counsel.

985
00:57:11,300 --> 00:57:12,510
律师是谁
Who is who?

986
00:57:12,590 --> 00:57:13,760
阿弗雷多・奎因诺斯
Alfredo Quinones.

987
00:57:16,350 --> 00:57:18,300
看来必须把他从床上叫起来
It would necessitate getting him out of bed, of course.

988
00:57:18,390 --> 00:57:21,970
但是考虑到这两位绅士的重要性
But given the importance of these gentlemen to

989
00:57:22,520 --> 00:57:24,020
还牵涉到多方利益
various interests,

990
00:57:25,350 --> 00:57:27,690
我敢说他肯定很乐意
I'm sure that he would be as pleased as I

991
00:57:28,900 --> 00:57:31,070
像我一样大半夜跑到这来
to come down here at 3:00 in the morning.

992
00:57:37,030 --> 00:57:38,620
赎我们要多少钱
How much did we cost him?

993
00:57:38,700 --> 00:57:40,700
每人1000美元
About $1,000 apiece.

994
00:57:53,260 --> 00:57:54,670
感激不尽
I can't thank you enough.

995
00:57:55,470 --> 00:57:56,720
别迟到
Don't be late.

996
00:58:24,750 --> 00:58:26,210
他妈的
Mother of balls!

997
00:58:27,880 --> 00:58:29,630
我们得去把车找回来
We got to rescue the car.

998
00:58:30,590 --> 00:58:31,840
现在不行  以后再说
Not now. We'll do it later.

999
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:33,130
我要去开会
I've got a meeting.

1000
00:58:33,420 --> 00:58:35,010
没有以后了
We do not have later.

1001
00:58:35,670 --> 00:58:37,550
车在他们手上已经12小时了
They've already had it 12 hours.

1002
00:58:38,260 --> 00:58:40,260
我知道这群狗杂种能干出什么来
I know how these bastards work.

1003
00:58:40,850 --> 00:58:44,020
他们能在12分钟内把火车抢得只剩车轴
They can strip a train to axles in 12 minutes.

1004
00:58:45,600 --> 00:58:47,440
能剩滴油就不错了
We'll be lucky to find an oil spot.

1005
00:58:51,770 --> 00:58:53,270
还要多久
How long is this gonna take?

1006
00:58:53,360 --> 00:58:54,530
我怎么知道
How would I know?

1007
00:58:54,610 --> 00:58:55,690
我不能迟到
I can't be late.

1008
00:58:55,780 --> 00:58:57,530
我真不知道你干嘛要去
I don't know why you're going at all.

1009
00:58:57,610 --> 00:58:59,320
那个男人不是个好东西
That guy is bad company.

1010
00:58:59,410 --> 00:59:01,030
他是个控制欲很强的混蛋
He's a manipulative prick.

1011
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:02,950
他把我们带出监狱了啊
He manipulated us out of jail, didn't he?

1012
00:59:03,450 --> 00:59:05,120
我们就都卖给他了
Now he fucking owns us.

1013
00:59:06,750 --> 00:59:08,460
我的舌头好像...
I got a tongue like...

1014
00:59:10,290 --> 00:59:11,630
像条毛巾
Like a towel.

1015
00:59:11,960 --> 00:59:13,210
想喝啤酒吗
Want a beer?

1016
00:59:14,250 --> 00:59:15,710
问我想喝啤酒吗
Do I want a beer?

1017
00:59:17,170 --> 00:59:18,670
不  我不想
No, I do not.

1018
00:59:20,090 --> 00:59:22,050
我再也不沾酒精了
I am never gonna touch alcohol again.

1019
00:59:34,820 --> 00:59:36,610
这是个什么玩意
What fresh hell is this?

1020
00:59:36,990 --> 00:59:38,440
前排座椅不见了
Front seat's gone.

1021
00:59:38,990 --> 00:59:40,700
报废了  是吧
That's a write-off. Isn't it?

1022
00:59:57,210 --> 01:00:00,380
我有个好主意
You know what, I've got a brilliant idea.

1023
01:00:23,530 --> 01:00:25,070
那是什么声音
What's that?

1024
01:00:25,410 --> 01:00:27,290
这根轴负重太大
There's too much weight on the axle.

1025
01:00:27,370 --> 01:00:29,410
试着向前移一点
Try and move forward a bit.

1026
01:00:29,540 --> 01:00:30,960
要迟到了
Ugh, gonna be late.

1027
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:33,040
要迟到好几天了
I'm gonna be a week late.

1028
01:00:36,800 --> 01:00:38,050
你在干嘛  萨拉
What are you doing, Sala?

1029
01:00:38,420 --> 01:00:41,090
我突然意识到我挺喜欢你的
I suddenly realize how much I like you.

1030
01:00:41,380 --> 01:00:42,680
你问我在干嘛是什么意思
What do you mean, what am I doing?

1031
01:00:42,760 --> 01:00:45,390
车轴有毛病了
There's something wrong with the axle.

1032
01:00:50,770 --> 01:00:52,850
天哪  那是被我们点着的警察
Oh, my God, it's the cop we set on fire.

1033
01:00:57,230 --> 01:00:59,030
表现得正常点
Try and look normal.

1034
01:01:07,080 --> 01:01:08,780
右转  右转
Make a right! Make a right!

1035
01:01:08,870 --> 01:01:10,540
-什么右转  右边没路  -往右转就行
- What right? There is no right. - Any right!

1036
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:39,110
他来了  保罗  请进
Oh, there he is. Paul, come in.

1037
01:01:39,780 --> 01:01:41,530
抱歉  有些意料之外的状况
Sorry. There were unexpected developments.

1038
01:01:41,610 --> 01:01:43,610
我得回家  重新过这一天
I had to go home and start the day again.

1039
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:46,990
可不是  时间就是不够用
Tell me about it. Some days are two sizes too small.

1040
01:01:47,570 --> 01:01:48,870
恐怕有人要先走了
Well, I'm afraid some of us had to leave.

1041
01:01:48,950 --> 01:01:50,870
金伯格先生  你认识的
But, Mr. Zimburger you know.

1042
01:01:50,990 --> 01:01:53,540
这是第一国家海事银行的格林先生
And this is Mr. Green of First National Maritime Bank.

1043
01:01:53,620 --> 01:01:54,620
要咖啡吗
You want some coffee?

1044
01:01:54,710 --> 01:01:56,670
我想我们得继续  豪尔
I think we should move right along, Hal.

1045
01:01:56,750 --> 01:01:58,040
-我要走了  -好的
- I gotta go. - Sure.

1046
01:01:58,130 --> 01:01:59,630
请坐  保罗
Sit down, Paul.

1047
01:02:00,710 --> 01:02:02,170
坎普先生  你可能已经知道
As you may know, Mr. Kemp,

1048
01:02:02,670 --> 01:02:05,220
这块岛屿是美国政府所有
the island is owned by the U.S. Government.

1049
01:02:05,300 --> 01:02:07,800
目前有一部分用作海军的射击场
Part of it presently used as a target range by the Navy.

1050
01:02:08,470 --> 01:02:10,180
我们的内部人士说
We know from internal sources...

1051
01:02:10,260 --> 01:02:11,430
你管我叫内部人士吗
Is that what you're calling me?

1052
01:02:13,810 --> 01:02:16,390
政府准备以租赁的方式让渡
...that the government is preparing to relinquish the lease,

1053
01:02:16,560 --> 01:02:18,350
这块岛屿上占地32平方英里的
and this place wakes up as 32 square miles

1054
01:02:18,690 --> 01:02:21,110
壮丽的前无古人的房地产事业将被开启
of magnificent and untouched real estate.

1055
01:02:21,730 --> 01:02:23,530
睁大眼睛
Knock your eyes out.

1056
01:02:23,990 --> 01:02:25,780
加勒比没有比这再美的海滩了
No prettier beaches in the Caribbean.

1057
01:02:26,360 --> 01:02:29,780
一条美轮美奂的小径环抱着整个岛屿
Orientated around one hell of a beautiful marina.

1058
01:02:31,830 --> 01:02:32,990
不是只建一座宾馆吗
Thought it was one hotel.

1059
01:02:33,080 --> 01:02:34,580
先建一座
We start with one hotel.

1060
01:02:34,660 --> 01:02:35,870
这是敲门砖
It's a foot in the door.

1061
01:02:35,960 --> 01:02:38,330
一旦运作起来  市场就打开了
Once we're up and running, we're servants of a market.

1062
01:02:39,170 --> 01:02:40,960
-就像这吗  -是的
- Like here? - Like here.

1063
01:02:41,670 --> 01:02:43,250
你看上去很焦虑  坎普先生
You look worried, Mr. Kemp.

1064
01:02:44,380 --> 01:02:46,220
他没有焦虑
He's not worried.

1065
01:02:46,300 --> 01:02:47,590
保罗和我昨晚都不太好过
Paul and I shared a tricky little night.

1066
01:02:48,720 --> 01:02:50,260
-是吧  保罗  -是
- Right, Paul? - Oh.

1067
01:02:50,640 --> 01:02:51,890
我们俩一夜无眠
Neither of us got much sleep.

1068
01:02:53,720 --> 01:02:54,970
我得走了  伙计们
I gotta go, guys.

1069
01:02:55,060 --> 01:02:57,020
你们继续讨论吧
Well, we'll leave you gentlemen to it.

1070
01:02:57,190 --> 01:02:58,640
坎普先生在合同上签字了吗
Has Mr. Kemp signed the papers?

1071
01:02:58,730 --> 01:03:00,520
现在就签
Doing that right now.

1072
01:03:01,610 --> 01:03:03,520
这是什么... 我签的是什么
What... What am I actually signing?

1073
01:03:03,610 --> 01:03:04,640
只不过是份保密协议
Just a confidentiality agreement,

1074
01:03:04,650 --> 01:03:06,030
确保我们可以相互信赖
affirmation of trust.

1075
01:03:06,110 --> 01:03:08,950
这样我们就在一条船上了
Just so we're all sitting in the same Jacuzzi.

1076
01:03:09,030 --> 01:03:12,240
防止有人搞破坏  你明白我的意思吧
In case a turd floats up, if you know what I mean.

1077
01:03:15,750 --> 01:03:18,000
保罗  我们去那边
Come on, Paul, let's go over here.

1078
01:03:22,540 --> 01:03:23,960
给你
Here you go.

1079
01:03:25,550 --> 01:03:27,210
那是句术语  保罗
It's just a technicality, Paul.

1080
01:03:27,300 --> 01:03:30,930
意思是你保证不向任何人透露这个计划
Means you promise not to talk to anybody about the project.

1081
01:03:31,220 --> 01:03:32,470
头感觉怎么样
How's the head?

1082
01:03:32,550 --> 01:03:33,930
不舒服
Unpleasant.

1083
01:03:34,560 --> 01:03:36,390
再次感谢你交了保释金
Gotta thank you again for putting up the bail.

1084
01:03:36,890 --> 01:03:38,850
我没看错你
It's held on my cognizance.

1085
01:03:38,940 --> 01:03:42,350
我肯定很多人都不会那么做
And I think it more than likely to slip various minds.

1086
01:03:43,190 --> 01:03:45,610
这地方遍地黄金  保罗
This place is a sea of money, Paul.

1087
01:03:45,860 --> 01:03:47,610
钱多的难以想象
Unbelievable money.

1088
01:03:48,530 --> 01:03:51,410
几乎所有的大公司都把资金投放到海外
Practically every major corporation hides its cash offshore.

1089
01:03:51,530 --> 01:03:52,820
我不喝  谢谢
No, thanks.

1090
01:03:52,910 --> 01:03:55,410
这对我们来说是好事
And that is good news for us,

1091
01:03:55,910 --> 01:03:58,250
因为我们就是海外
because we are the shore.

1092
01:03:59,750 --> 01:04:02,170
流入波多黎各的每一块钱
Not one dollar that wings its way into Puerto Rico

1093
01:04:02,250 --> 01:04:03,750
都不用交税
pays a cent in tax.

1094
01:04:04,250 --> 01:04:05,750
-一点不用吗  -一点也不用
- Nothing? - Not penny one.

1095
01:04:05,840 --> 01:04:07,050
包括化工企业
That includes chemical companies,

1096
01:04:07,130 --> 01:04:08,670
石油公司  矿产公司
oil companies, mining companies.

1097
01:04:09,170 --> 01:04:11,050
离这不到二十英里的山里
There's $12 billion worth of copper in mountains

1098
01:04:11,050 --> 01:04:13,260
有价值一百二十亿美元的铜矿
less than 20 miles from here.

1099
01:04:13,350 --> 01:04:15,720
一百二十亿美元
A dozen billion dollars.

1100
01:04:18,430 --> 01:04:22,810
这还有像我这样怎样赚钱的人
And there's people like me who know how to get it out.

1101
01:04:24,730 --> 01:04:27,440
说实在的
So, putting it into context,

1102
01:04:28,280 --> 01:04:30,310
我可不想为了一千块
I don't envisage the breaking of bones

1103
01:04:30,310 --> 01:04:31,450
累断了骨头
to get at a thousand bucks.

1104
01:04:33,110 --> 01:04:34,820
你刚才不在
Because you weren't here,

1105
01:04:34,910 --> 01:04:37,330
我替你安排了和金伯格的行程
I agreed to an itinerary with Zimburger on your behalf.

1106
01:04:37,410 --> 01:04:40,960
早上出发  没问题吧
You'll be traveling down in the morning. Hope that's okay.

1107
01:04:45,790 --> 01:04:47,750
你需要什么吗  保罗
What do you need, Paul?

1108
01:04:48,840 --> 01:04:51,300
你觉得和金伯格
Well, just in the context of this Zimburger thing,

1109
01:04:51,380 --> 01:04:54,470
会有进展吗
do you think there's a possibility of an advance?

1110
01:04:55,470 --> 01:04:56,460
我本不想问  
I don't like to ask,

1111
01:04:56,470 --> 01:04:59,310
但是一涉及到钱罗特曼就很不靠谱
but Lotterman's pretty erratic with the paycheck, you know.

1112
01:04:59,390 --> 01:05:00,430
需要弄辆车
Need to get a hold of a car.

1113
01:05:00,810 --> 01:05:01,850
你没车吗
You don't have a car?

1114
01:05:01,980 --> 01:05:03,690
没有拿得出手的
Nothing too reliable.

1115
01:05:03,770 --> 01:05:04,450
还有
Plus, sooner or later,

1116
01:05:04,450 --> 01:05:06,150
我早晚得找个好地方住
I'm gonna have to find a decent place to live.

1117
01:05:06,310 --> 01:05:07,610
我们可以帮你

太棒了  拿瓶香槟
Good. Grab some champagne.

1258
01:16:30,120 --> 01:16:31,210
嘿  船长
Hey, Captain.

1259
01:16:36,250 --> 01:16:37,960
你带萨拉去岛上了
Did you take Sala to the island?

1260
01:16:41,800 --> 01:16:44,090
保罗  你不该那么做
You shouldn't have done that, Paul.

1261
01:16:44,180 --> 01:16:46,050
我们签保密协议就是为了不让外人去
It's why we have a confidentiality agreement.

1262
01:16:46,600 --> 01:16:47,680
他不感兴趣
He isn't interested.

1263
01:16:47,770 --> 01:16:49,890
他那嘴跟美联社一样
He's got a mouth like an AP wire.

1264
01:16:53,350 --> 01:16:55,520
我不知道他在那都干了些什么
I just don't know what he was doing there.

1265
01:16:55,610 --> 01:16:58,780
我也他妈搞不懂他在这干什么
And I sure as shit don't know what he's doing here.

1266
01:17:28,810 --> 01:17:31,020
不加入我们吗
Not going glum on us, are you?

1267
01:17:32,560 --> 01:17:34,060
一个人静静
Just thoughts.

1268
01:17:35,520 --> 01:17:36,900
什么书
What's the book?

1269
01:17:36,980 --> 01:17:39,270
古舟子咏
The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.

1270
01:17:39,480 --> 01:17:40,520
在1797年
It was written in 1797

1271
01:17:40,520 --> 01:17:42,780
一个叫柯勒律治的瘾君子写的
by a junkie called Coleridge.

1272
01:17:44,910 --> 01:17:47,530
他写这本书时25岁
He wrote that when he was 25 years old.

1273
01:17:49,240 --> 01:17:52,150
十年了我整天带着打字机乱转
I've been dragging a typewriter around with me for 10.

1274
01:17:52,150 --> 01:17:54,160
什么也没写出来
I've written nothing.

1275
01:17:54,250 --> 01:17:56,120
你已经写了几本书
You've written some books.

1276
01:17:56,210 --> 01:17:57,380
不算
Nah.

1277
01:17:57,880 --> 01:17:59,540
那些书空洞无物
They had no voice.

1278
01:18:02,800 --> 01:18:05,180
我不知道该怎么写出自己的风格
I don't know how to write like me.

1279
01:18:10,100 --> 01:18:11,600
我讨厌那样
I resent that.

1280
01:18:11,770 --> 01:18:13,640
不  我必须说他很好
No, I really have to say he's all right.

1281
01:18:13,730 --> 01:18:14,980
我必须承认
I have to admit.

1282
01:18:15,060 --> 01:18:16,900
生意归生意
Fair is fair. Fair is fair.

1283
01:18:16,980 --> 01:18:18,060
谢谢下午对我的招待
Thank you for the afternoon.

1284
01:18:18,150 --> 01:18:19,610
没准在镇上还能见到你
Maybe we'll see you in town.

1285
01:18:19,730 --> 01:18:20,770
你要去哪
Where you going?

1286
01:18:21,440 --> 01:18:22,980
她的朋友们在乐队表演
Her friend's playing in a band.

1287
01:18:23,070 --> 01:18:24,320
我们去看看
We're gonna go check it out.

1288
01:18:24,400 --> 01:18:25,530
我们也想去
Oh, we want to come.

1289
01:18:26,200 --> 01:18:27,490
我替她说明白了
I'll rephrase that.

1290
01:18:27,740 --> 01:18:28,820
是不想去
We don't want to come.

1291
01:18:28,910 --> 01:18:30,700
我们想去  女孩子们想去跳舞
Yes, we do. Us girls want to dance.

1292
01:18:31,240 --> 01:18:32,700
你明天要跳舞的
You're dancing tomorrow.

1293
01:18:32,790 --> 01:18:34,110
如果一切都是提前计划好的
What's the point of going to carnival

1294
01:18:34,110 --> 01:18:35,540
那来狂欢节还有什么意思
if everything is preplanned?

1295
01:18:36,290 --> 01:18:36,900
我要去跳舞  
I want to dance,

1296
01:18:36,900 --> 01:18:38,200
如果你不陪我去  我和他们走了
and if you're not going to take me, i'm gonna go with them.

1297
01:18:38,200 --> 01:18:39,710
她把你镇住了  豪尔
She's got you trumped, Hal.

1298
01:18:39,790 --> 01:18:41,000
坐下  你醉了
Sit down. You're drunk.

1299
01:18:41,670 --> 01:18:43,460
那又怎样  大家都醉了 
So what? So is everyone else.

1300
01:18:43,550 --> 01:18:44,800
走啦
Come on.

1301
01:18:45,090 --> 01:18:47,300
走吧  我们去跳舞  说不定很好玩
Come on, let's do it. It might be amusing.

1302
01:18:56,100 --> 01:18:57,480
小心  小心 
Oh, cuidado. Careful.

1303
01:18:58,310 --> 01:18:59,480
到了  下车
Here we go.

1304
01:19:40,350 --> 01:19:41,440
我们玩够了  我们要走了
We're done.we are spent.

1305
01:19:41,520 --> 01:19:42,060
你们要走了  
You're gonna go?

1306
01:19:42,060 --> 01:19:42,730
是啊  我们要走了
Yes, we're gonna leave.

1307
01:19:42,820 --> 01:19:43,820
你玩够了吗
You're done?

1308
01:19:43,900 --> 01:19:45,280
我真的不能再跳了
I can't dance no more. Really.

1309
01:19:45,360 --> 01:19:46,780
等等  我马上就出去
Hold on. You know what? I'll be out.

1310
01:19:46,780 --> 01:19:48,190
我去找一下香诺
Let me just get Chenault.

1311
01:19:53,330 --> 01:19:55,030
你想要朗姆还是啤酒
You want rum or beer?

1312
01:19:55,120 --> 01:19:56,290
嗯  都要
Um... Both.

1313
01:19:56,370 --> 01:19:59,710
两杯朗姆  两杯啤酒
Dos, uh, rum, uh, dos cervezas.

1314
01:19:59,790 --> 01:20:00,960
我们要走了
We're gonna go.

1315
01:20:01,040 --> 01:20:02,630
我们要走了
We're gonna go.

1316
01:20:03,290 --> 01:20:03,500
什么
What?

1317
01:20:03,500 --> 01:20:04,790
娜塔莉走了
Natalie's leaving,

1318
01:20:04,880 --> 01:20:06,170
我们也得走
So let's go.

1319
01:20:06,260 --> 01:20:08,170
-走吧  走  -不  不  不
- Come on, come on. - No, no, no, no.

1320
01:20:10,720 --> 01:20:12,720
香诺  过来  我们得走了
Chenault, come here. We're leaving.

1321
01:20:14,890 --> 01:20:16,430
-香诺  -不要
- Chenault. - Stop it!

1322
01:20:16,640 --> 01:20:18,060
香诺

1323
01:20:23,980 --> 01:20:25,230
嘿  怎么

01:21:09,240 --> 01:21:10,360

1335

1336
01:21:20,830 --> 01:21:22,120

01:21:27,340 --> 01:21:28,960
没关系的*

1338
01:21:29,550 --> 01:21:30,840
我试过*

1339
01:21:31,760 --> 01:21:33,340
很好*
That's right

1340
01:21:58,700 --> 01:22:00,660
香诺  过来  香诺
Chenault, come here! Chenault!

1341
01:22:01,290 --> 01:22:04,000
把你们的手拿开  你们这些混蛋
Get your hands off me, you motherfucker!

1342
01:22:05,790 --> 01:22:06,870
你们敢惹我
You want to fuck with me?

1343
01:22:12,170 --> 01:22:14,720
知道我是谁吗
You know who I am?

1344
01:22:14,800 --> 01:22:16,220
你们这帮混蛋
You motherfucker!

1345
01:22:16,300 --> 01:22:18,180
知道我是谁吗
You know who I am?

1346
01:22:21,930 --> 01:22:23,470
你找死吧  快走  快走
You're a dead man! Go! Go!

1347
01:22:23,560 --> 01:22:24,850
把手拿开
Get your hands off me.

1348
01:22:24,940 --> 01:22:26,350
你找死  滚
You're a dead man! Go!

1349
01:22:26,690 --> 01:22:28,060
没事
Forget it.

1350
01:22:29,860 --> 01:22:31,690
我给你叫辆出租车  滚开
We'll call you a cab. Fuck off!

1351
01:22:36,660 --> 01:22:37,780
我得把那女孩带走
I gotta get the girl.

1352
01:22:38,030 --> 01:22:40,370
她正玩得高兴呢  我们打烊了
She's having a good time. We closed.

1353
01:22:43,290 --> 01:22:44,620
你聋了
You deaf?

1354
01:22:44,710 --> 01:22:46,370
我说我们打烊了
I said we closed.

1355
01:22:46,460 --> 01:22:47,960
不行  保罗
No way, Paul.

1356
01:22:48,420 --> 01:22:49,670
行不通
No way.

1357
01:23:20,910 --> 01:23:22,660
我四处都找过了
I looked everywhere.

1358
01:23:23,330 --> 01:23:25,240
我去了宪兵队
I went to the gendarme.

1359
01:23:26,040 --> 01:23:27,160
怎么样
And?

1360
01:23:28,330 --> 01:23:29,830
我们又回去了
We went up there.

1361
01:23:29,920 --> 01:23:31,750
什么都没有  没人
Nothing. Nobody there.

1362
01:23:33,880 --> 01:23:35,960
只有一个老太太在擦地
But an old woman with a mop.

1363
01:23:38,260 --> 01:23:40,760
她比警察都有用
She was more help than the cops were.

1364
01:23:41,600 --> 01:23:44,350
他说你女朋友喜欢别人我有什么办法
"What can I do if your girlfriend likes someone else?" He said.

1365
01:23:45,140 --> 01:23:47,270
保罗  他说得对
He's right about that, Paul.

1366
01:23:48,980 --> 01:23:50,900
她不是你女朋友
She's not your girlfriend.

1367
01:24:00,610 --> 01:24:04,950
没准  没准她已经回船上了
Maybe... Maybe she went back to the boat.

1368
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:11,290
你  你去船上找过了吗
Did you... Did you try the boat?

1369
01:24:11,880 --> 01:24:12,960
没有
No.

1370
01:24:14,290 --> 01:24:16,710
我觉得他不会让她回去的
I don't think he'd let her back on.

1371
01:24:31,730 --> 01:24:37,110
她和你在一起吗
Is she with you?

1372
01:24:38,030 --> 01:24:40,990
你他妈管好你自己的事情
Why don't you mind your own goddamn business?

1373
01:24:42,910 --> 01:24:44,490
钥匙给我
I want the keys.

1374
01:24:45,450 --> 01:24:46,780
雪佛兰
The Chevy.

1375
01:25:05,350 --> 01:25:07,010
坎普  是你搞砸的
You blew it, Kemp.

1376
01:25:31,790 --> 01:25:33,540
都生锈了
It's all rust.

1377
01:25:37,380 --> 01:25:40,590
拖船上的救生圈都比这轮胎强
I've seen better tires hanging over the side of a tug.

1378
01:25:41,220 --> 01:25:42,920
要还是不要啊
You want it or not?

1379
01:25:46,140 --> 01:25:47,720
好  我们要
Yeah, we want it.

1380
01:25:48,890 --> 01:25:52,100
大家周五都去拿钱  是吗
Everyone turns up for their Friday check, right?

1381
01:25:52,480 --> 01:25:54,390
没钱  也就不会有罗特曼
No check, no Lotterman.

1382
01:25:55,230 --> 01:25:58,730
所以我去找他那位丑得惨不忍睹的老婆
So I go around to see that unforgivably ugly wife of his.

1383
01:25:59,070 --> 01:26:01,110
她告诉我他去迈阿密了
She tells me he's gone to Miami.

1384
01:26:01,190 --> 01:26:02,440
干什么
For what?

1385
01:26:02,530 --> 01:26:04,650
你不知道  我也不知道
You don't know, I don't know.

1386
01:26:05,410 --> 01:26:07,280
但是他的手下回来了
But the scabs are back.

1387
01:26:08,530 --> 01:26:09,940
自从梅瑞走后
Since Merell went,

1388
01:26:09,940 --> 01:26:11,910
报社领导一个不如一个
the paper took a turn for the worse.

1389
01:26:14,250 --> 01:26:15,830
有什么需要的吗
Is there anything in the spinner?

1390
01:26:15,920 --> 01:26:17,580
我们需要新的床单
We need a fresh sack.

1391
01:26:17,920 --> 01:26:21,380
我或许有别的东西会让你们感兴趣
Well, maybe I can interest you gentlemen in something else.

1392
01:26:21,710 --> 01:26:23,260
什么  死吗
Like what, death?

1393
01:26:23,970 --> 01:26:27,010
史上最强的毒品
Like the most powerful drug in the history of narcotics.

1394
01:26:29,010 --> 01:26:31,810
我还没权利讨论和公开这个
I'm not at liberty to discuss or disclose.

1395
01:26:31,930 --> 01:26:35,020
我只能说这东西太厉害了
All I can tell you is this stuff is so powerful,

1396
01:26:35,980 --> 01:26:37,190
他们把这东西给共党分子
they give it to Communists.

1397
01:26:37,770 --> 01:26:38,860
谁干的
Who does?

1398
01:26:39,270 --> 01:26:40,520
FBI
The FBI.

1399
01:26:40,940 --> 01:26:43,530
FBI为什么让共党分子爽翻呢
Why would the FBI get Communists high?

1400
01:26:44,320 --> 01:26:46,450
我也不知道
That I can't help you with.

1401
01:26:48,160 --> 01:26:50,200
用的时候就像滴眼药
You take it like eye drops.

1402
01:26:52,910 --> 01:26:54,040
弄到眼里
In the eye?

1403
01:26:54,120 --> 01:26:55,750
我认为是
So I understand.

1404
01:26:57,120 --> 01:26:58,540
能让眼睛看到某些东西
It makes the eye see things.

1405
01:26:58,630 --> 01:27:00,250
可以看到不一样的东西
You see a different reality.

1406
01:27:01,340 --> 01:27:02,500
你想用什么换
What do you want for it?

1407
01:27:02,590 --> 01:27:03,880
如果你帮我个忙
I'll throw it in with the bike

1408
01:27:03,960 --> 01:27:05,800
这就算你买车的赠品
if you do me a favor.

1409
01:27:05,920 --> 01:27:07,800
帮什么忙
What's the favor?

1410
01:27:10,640 --> 01:27:12,510
我想让你跟我一起去洗手间
I want you to come to the bathroom with me.

1411
01:27:14,520 --> 01:27:15,930
没问题
He's your man.

1412
01:27:16,440 --> 01:27:17,980
-五十美元  对吗  -是的
- $50, right? - Yeah.

1413
01:27:33,370 --> 01:27:35,290
他想让我看他的老二
He wants me to look at his dick.

1414
01:27:35,370 --> 01:27:37,000
我当然拒绝了
I flatly refused.

1415
01:27:37,330 --> 01:27:39,000
他让你看那个干吗
What does he want you to look at it for?

1416
01:27:39,080 --> 01:27:40,420
他说他那个出问题了
Says there's something wrong with it.

1417
01:27:40,500 --> 01:27:41,670
这是男人的问题
It's a gentleman's matter.

1418
01:27:41,750 --> 01:27:42,920
我才不看
I'm not looking at it!

1419
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:44,300
好吧  把药还给我
All right, give me the drugs back.

1420
01:27:44,380 --> 01:27:45,670
不  等等
No! Wait.

1421
01:27:46,300 --> 01:27:47,920
我来看
I'll look at it.

1422
01:27:53,010 --> 01:27:55,010
我用镜子看
I'll view it in the mirror.

1423
01:28:14,280 --> 01:28:15,660
是淋病吗
Is it clap?

1424
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:19,710
答对了
A standing ovation.

1425
01:28:48,360 --> 01:28:49,990
你看见什么了吗
You see anything?

1426
01:28:50,360 --> 01:28:51,490
没有
No.

1427
01:28:54,370 --> 01:28:55,830
我也没有
Neither do I.

1428
01:29:14,640 --> 01:29:17,010
我们再等五分钟
We'll give it another five minutes.

1429
01:29:18,470 --> 01:29:19,890
应付开支方面有问题吗
Trouble making ends meet?

1430
01:29:19,980 --> 01:29:22,230
那么你需要借贷人  对的
Then, you need the Lending Man. Right.

1431
01:29:22,310 --> 01:29:24,270
当你缺钱的时候
When money dries up fast,

1432
01:29:24,810 --> 01:29:26,860
欢迎您来我们这里获取现金
you're welcome to our cash.

1433
01:29:26,940 --> 01:29:27,880
来找借贷人借钱吧
So borrow from the Lending Man.

1434
01:29:27,890 --> 01:29:29,320
现在就给借贷人打电话吧
Call the Lending Man now.

1435
01:29:52,340 --> 01:29:54,340
我们用药多长时间了
How long since we took it?

1436
01:29:57,890 --> 01:29:59,470
不知道
I don't know.

1437
01:30:01,560 --> 01:30:02,930
有段时间了
A while.

1438
01:30:11,610 --> 01:30:12,650
他是胡说八道的  不是吗
Bullshit, isn't it?

1439
01:30:14,320 --> 01:30:15,820
是胡说吗
Is it bullshit?

1440
01:31:42,620 --> 01:31:43,660
天哪
Jesus.

1441
01:31:45,040 --> 01:31:47,660
你那舌头像臭肠子
Your tongue is like an accusatory giblet.

1442
01:31:54,420 --> 01:31:56,300
上帝啊  别伸过来
For Christ's sake, keep it out.

1443
01:31:56,380 --> 01:31:57,550
你在说什么呢
What are you talking about?

1444
01:31:57,630 --> 01:31:59,180
你那是撒旦的舌头
Your tongue belongs to Satan!

1445
01:31:59,260 --> 01:32:00,470
你是不是疯了
Are you out of your mind?

1446
01:32:00,840 --> 01:32:02,140
把它弄出去
Keep it out!

1447
01:32:03,430 --> 01:32:05,350
要是你再这样  我就杀了你
If it goes back into your mouth, it'll kill you.

1448
01:32:07,310 --> 01:32:08,520
我们必须把它弄进水池
We've got to get it into the sink!

1449
01:32:10,480 --> 01:32:12,190
你吓到我了
You're giving me fear.

1450
01:32:12,270 --> 01:32:13,690
住手  你吓到我了
Stop it! I've got fear!

1451
01:32:13,770 --> 01:32:15,320
去你妈的  我也是
Fuck you. So do I.

1452
01:32:15,400 --> 01:32:16,610
你爽翻了吧  白痴
You're high, you fool.

1453
01:32:16,690 --> 01:32:17,990
喝点朗姆酒吧
Drink some rum.

1454
01:32:39,800 --> 01:32:42,340
我刚才失控了吧
I thought I was losing grip in there.

1455
01:32:44,640 --> 01:32:45,720
我们用的是什么
What did we take?

1456
01:32:45,810 --> 01:32:47,310
我不知道
I don't know.

1457
01:32:49,680 --> 01:32:51,690
我们应该再弄点
We need to get some more.

1458
01:33:04,030 --> 01:33:05,120
怪不得
That explains it.

1459
01:33:07,990 --> 01:33:09,330
不是吗
Doesn't it?

1460
01:33:09,660 --> 01:33:11,290
怪不得什么
Explains what?

1461
01:33:14,130 --> 01:33:15,380
这个世界
The world.

1462
01:33:17,840 --> 01:33:19,170
还有我们
And us.

1463
01:33:25,350 --> 01:33:26,550
我很好奇你们如何
I wonder what it is

1464
01:33:26,640 --> 01:33:29,470
看待我们不同的世界
you might think about our different worlds.

1465
01:33:31,690 --> 01:33:34,480
他醉眼朦胧的看着我说
He looked at me kind of sideways and said,

1466
01:33:35,020 --> 01:33:38,520
人类是这个世界上唯一
"Human beings are the only creatures on earth

1467
01:33:39,440 --> 01:33:41,110
维护上帝的生物
"that claim a God.

1468
01:33:42,450 --> 01:33:46,280
也是唯一行为不受上帝约束的生物
"And the only living thing that behaves like it hasn't got one.

1469
01:33:48,200 --> 01:33:51,000
这世界只属于你吗
"Does the world belong to no one but you?"

1470
01:33:53,330 --> 01:33:56,040
他说这话的时候  我大吃一惊
And when he said it, I was taken aback.

1471
01:33:58,090 --> 01:34:00,840
并不是因为是他说的这话
Not because of who was doing the talking,

1472
01:34:01,090 --> 01:34:03,800
而是因为我最终明白了
because I finally understood the connection

1473
01:34:03,880 --> 01:34:06,390
吃不上饭的孩子
between children scavenging for food

1474
01:34:07,050 --> 01:34:10,680
和银行的闪亮门牌之间的关系
and shiny brass plates on the front doors of banks.

1475
01:34:12,600 --> 01:34:13,930
我们得走了
Gotta go.

1476
01:34:42,300 --> 01:34:43,800
进来
Shh. Come in.

1477
01:34:44,420 --> 01:34:45,670
进来
Come in.

1478
01:34:49,930 --> 01:34:51,600
我们得走了
We gotta go.

1479
01:34:52,100 --> 01:34:53,970
等我一下
Give me a minute.

1480
01:34:57,350 --> 01:34:59,770
我在楼下等你
I'll be waiting for you downstairs.

1481
01:35:11,950 --> 01:35:14,200
你能过来真不错
Oh, how nice of you to drop in.

1482
01:35:14,290 --> 01:35:15,700
我去了狂欢节
I was covering the carnival.

1483
01:35:15,790 --> 01:35:17,120
我可不是这么听说的
That's not what I heard.

1484
01:35:17,210 --> 01:35:19,380
我听说你沐浴在桑德森的月光里
I heard you were in the moonlight for Sanderson.

1485
01:35:19,460 --> 01:35:20,500
我什么
I was what?

1486
01:35:20,590 --> 01:35:21,960
沐浴桑德森的月光
Moonlighting for Sanderson.

1487
01:35:22,050 --> 01:35:23,050
赛古拉在哪里
Where's Segurra?

1488
01:35:23,130 --> 01:35:24,460
赛古拉已经不在了
Mr. Segurra's no longer with us.

1489
01:35:24,550 --> 01:35:25,550
我给你写了一篇故事
I got a story for you.

1490
01:35:25,630 --> 01:35:28,380
是啊  你可能注意到了我很忙
Yeah, you may have noticed that I'm somewhat busy.

1491
01:35:28,470 --> 01:35:30,590
这个真的很重要  牵扯到
This is real important, involving Mr.

1492
01:35:30,590 --> 01:35:32,300
赛古拉先生和桑德森先生
Segurra and Mr. Hal Sanderson.

1493
01:35:32,390 --> 01:35:33,890
我来告诉你为什么不重要
I'm gonna tell you how important it isn't.

1494
01:35:33,970 --> 01:35:35,580
我有21个等我发钱的职员
I got 21 jobs on the line

1495
01:35:35,580 --> 01:35:36,810
还有一家要倒闭的报社
and a newspaper going under.

1496
01:35:36,890 --> 01:35:38,390
把这个印出来  你就能卖掉了
Print this, and you'll sell it.

1497
01:35:38,480 --> 01:35:39,900
一场精心设计的骗局
A planning scam.

1498
01:35:39,980 --> 01:35:42,020
真的是对天堂的掠夺
Literally despoliation of a paradise.

1499
01:35:42,110 --> 01:35:44,360
数千人将会像垃圾一样被扫进大海
A thousand people will be swept into the sea like garbage.

1500
01:35:44,650 --> 01:35:45,900
你真古怪  坎普
You are weird, Kemp.

1501
01:35:45,990 --> 01:35:48,200
关键不是对他们有什么影响  是对你
It's not what it's doing to them, it's what it's doing to you.

1502
01:35:48,490 --> 01:35:49,740
这叫做新闻
It's called journalism.

1503
01:35:49,820 --> 01:35:51,200
真好笑
Oh, make me laugh.

1504
01:35:51,660 --> 01:35:53,080
我以前让你少喝
I asked you to tidy up the booze,

1505
01:35:53,160 --> 01:35:54,790
你连屋子里的酒都不肯拿走
you couldn't even sweep out a room.

1506
01:35:54,870 --> 01:35:56,120
你觉得你为什么能在这工作
Why do you think you're working here?

1507
01:35:56,200 --> 01:35:59,330
因为你身上没有一点适合做记者
'Cause you're everything that's wrong with a journalist.

1508
01:35:59,420 --> 01:36:00,190
而你身上每一点
And you're everything

1509
01:36:00,190 --> 01:36:01,830
都是对报纸的侮辱
that's wrong with this insult of a newspaper.

1510
01:36:01,920 --> 01:36:03,670
完全同意
Unanimously agreed.

1511
01:36:03,960 --> 01:36:05,840
你他妈闭嘴  莫伯格
Why don't you shut it, Moburg?

1512
01:36:06,380 --> 01:36:08,670
你简直就是浪费了人类的精子
You are a waste of human sperm.

1513
01:36:10,680 --> 01:36:14,810
你慢慢的痛苦的去死吧
Die a prolonged and relentlessly agonizing death!

1514
01:36:30,160 --> 01:36:31,360
她是你的了
Enjoy her.

1515
01:36:56,930 --> 01:36:58,600
我给你泡了茶
Made you some tea.

1516
01:37:05,730 --> 01:37:07,730
你应该试着睡一觉
You should try and sleep.

1517
01:37:08,070 --> 01:37:09,690
我占用了你的床
I stole your bed.

1518
01:37:10,400 --> 01:37:12,150
没事
It's okay.

1519
01:37:12,570 --> 01:37:14,320
我去写东西
I'm going to write.

1520
01:37:19,500 --> 01:37:20,950
很抱歉
I'm so sorry.

1521
01:37:22,580 --> 01:37:24,080
别这么说
Don't be sorry.

1522
01:37:27,590 --> 01:37:30,090
你帮了我一个大大的忙
You did me the best favor I ever had.

1523
01:37:35,180 --> 01:37:37,260
这不是做梦  香诺
There is no dream, Chenault.

1524
01:37:39,430 --> 01:37:41,520
只不过是可耻的贪婪
Just a piss puddle of greed,

1525
01:37:42,810 --> 01:37:45,060
在世上蔓延开来
spreading throughout the world.

1526
01:37:49,690 --> 01:37:53,320
我想对你们读者做出承诺
I want to make a promise to you, the reader.

1527
01:37:54,240 --> 01:37:56,820
我不知道明天能不能做到
And I don't know if I can fulfill it tomorrow

1528
01:37:56,910 --> 01:37:58,990
连后天能不能也不知道
or even the day after that.

1529
01:37:59,620 --> 01:38:02,660
但是我报道了这个世上的混蛋们
But I put the bastards of this world on notice.

1530
01:38:03,920 --> 01:38:07,080
我不关心他们的利益
That I do not have their best interests at heart.

1531
01:38:08,880 --> 01:38:11,300
我要替我的读者说话
I will try and speak for my reader.

1532
01:38:12,260 --> 01:38:13,970
这就是我的承诺
That is my promise.

1533
01:38:14,470 --> 01:38:19,100
这是墨水与勇气共鸣的声音
And it will be a voice made of ink and rage.

1534
01:38:22,350 --> 01:38:24,060
坐下吧  我给你煮了咖啡
Sit down. I made you coffee.

1535
01:38:24,140 --> 01:38:25,480
谢谢
Oh, thanks.

1536
01:38:28,270 --> 01:38:30,440
一份你的  一份我的
One for you and one for me.

1537
01:38:33,700 --> 01:38:36,990
天哪  怎么一起来就看到这个
Oh, man, I would rather not start the day with this.

1538
01:38:37,570 --> 01:38:39,530
-这是什么  -传票
- What is it? - It's a writ.

1539
01:38:39,620 --> 01:38:41,120
意味着我们要上法庭了
Means we're going to court.

1540
01:38:41,200 --> 01:38:43,620
这意味着只要他们愿意就可以拘捕我们
It means they can arrest us, should they so desire,

1541
01:38:43,710 --> 01:38:45,580
什么时候都行
any damn minute they please.

1542
01:38:45,670 --> 01:38:47,250
我们得去找个律师谈谈
We need to speak to a lawyer.

1543
01:38:47,330 --> 01:38:49,130
我们连电话都没有
We don't even have a phone.

1544
01:38:49,210 --> 01:38:50,840
我认识一个老家伙  是个西班牙律师
I know an old guy, Spanish Advocate.

1545
01:38:51,250 --> 01:38:52,420
他欠我个人情
Kind of owes me one.

1546
01:38:52,510 --> 01:38:53,960
你去把衣服穿好  我们去找他
You should get dressed. We'll go down there.

1547
01:38:54,050 --> 01:38:56,510
没水了  我身上还有肥皂
Water ran out. I'm covered in soap.

1548
01:38:56,760 --> 01:38:58,510
操  我去看看吧
Fuck it. See what I can do.

1549
01:39:00,600 --> 01:39:02,100
这是怎么回事
What's it for?

1550
01:39:02,270 --> 01:39:04,470
是豪尔
Uh... it's Hal.

1551
01:39:07,350 --> 01:39:10,310
原来我们签合同了  现在他不干了
He put up a bond for us on this thing, and now he's pulled it.

1552
01:39:10,400 --> 01:39:11,520
你看
Here.

1553
01:39:17,410 --> 01:39:19,530
他是个骗子  保罗
You know he's a crook, Paul.

1554
01:39:20,530 --> 01:39:22,330
法院传的是我们
And we get the writs.

1555
01:40:59,090 --> 01:41:00,470
这是什么
What is it?

1556
01:41:00,970 --> 01:41:03,220
是希特勒
It's, er... Hitler.

1557
01:41:12,520 --> 01:41:13,850
完了
It's over.

1558
01:41:14,150 --> 01:41:15,150
什么完了
What is?

1559
01:41:16,570 --> 01:41:18,230
他们把报社关了
They shut us down.

1560
01:41:19,490 --> 01:41:21,610
他就站在那里对我们撒谎
He just stood there and lied to us.

1561
01:41:21,700 --> 01:41:22,900
他还不如一台破旧收银机
He hasn't got the morality

1562
01:41:22,990 --> 01:41:24,410
有职业道德
of a clapped out cash register.

1563
01:41:24,490 --> 01:41:26,160
我很不想跟你们这么说  伙计们
I hate to tell you this, guys,

1564
01:41:26,240 --> 01:41:28,080
但是没有遣散费
but it was to avoid severance.

1565
01:41:28,160 --> 01:41:29,910
我们都知道会这样  查理
We all know what it was for, Charlie.

1566
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:31,750
-我们能做什么  -什么都不做
- What are we gonna do? - Nothing.

1567
01:41:31,830 --> 01:41:33,250
我们无能为力
There's nothing we can do,

1568
01:41:33,330 --> 01:41:34,790
除了去劳动局告他
except report him to the labor board,

1569
01:41:34,880 --> 01:41:36,540
这跟什么都不做一样
which is the same thing as doing nothing.

1570
01:41:36,630 --> 01:41:38,000
我不同意
I disagree.

1571
01:41:38,130 --> 01:41:39,880
我们得反击
We gotta strike back

1572
01:41:40,340 --> 01:41:42,670
要让这混蛋倒在自家门前
and nail this bastard to his own front door.

1573
01:41:42,760 --> 01:41:44,430
那感谢上帝  我们要怎么做呢
And how, pray, do we do that?

1574
01:41:44,510 --> 01:41:46,390
我们印刷报纸
By printing the paper.

1575
01:41:46,970 --> 01:41:48,970
我们手上罗特曼的把柄多了
We got tons of stuff on Lotterman.

1576
01:41:49,060 --> 01:41:52,020
他玩过的所有小伎俩
Every happy maggot with his hand in the till.

1577
01:41:52,520 --> 01:41:54,690
这很有可能是最后一次发行了
It may be the last-ever issue,

1578
01:41:54,810 --> 01:41:56,610
但是我们用满腔怒火来发行
but we go out in a blaze of rage.

1579
01:41:56,690 --> 01:41:59,820
你在说什么  发一次要花两千两百美元
What are you talking about? It costs $2,200 a shot.

1580
01:42:00,030 --> 01:42:01,070
我们去找工贼
We bring in the scabs.

1581
01:42:00,030 --> 01:42:01,070
收钱帮人偷盗的游民

1582
01:42:01,190 --> 01:42:02,280
他们为了钱什么都干
They're picketing for money.

1583
01:42:02,740 --> 01:42:03,900
你这是在幻想
You're through the looking glass.

1584
01:42:04,030 --> 01:42:06,530
我们连买酒的钱都不够
We haven't even got enough money for drinks.

1585
01:42:07,870 --> 01:42:08,870
这根本不值得斗
It's not worth the fight.

1586
01:42:08,950 --> 01:42:11,040
这已经出现很久了
This has been coming down the pike for a long time.

1587
01:42:11,120 --> 01:42:12,620
该结束的时候自然就结束了
You got to know it's over when it's over.

1588
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:14,960
这份破报纸
This lousy little Caribbean rag is nothing

1589
01:42:15,040 --> 01:42:16,500
别人都拿来包鱼头
but a wrapping for fish heads.

1590
01:42:16,580 --> 01:42:17,630
再说  已经停工了
Plus, it's a lockout.

1591
01:42:17,710 --> 01:42:19,210
去他妈的停工
Fuck the locks.

1592
01:42:20,090 --> 01:42:21,960
我们直接闯进去
I say we just walk in.

1593
01:42:24,430 --> 01:42:26,050
有人和我一起吗
Anybody with me?

1594
01:42:29,220 --> 01:42:30,310
鲍勃
Bob?

1595
01:42:31,680 --> 01:42:33,560
你知道我是支持你的
You know I'm with you.

1596
01:42:38,110 --> 01:42:40,230
我们没付钱
We didn't pay the bill.

1597
01:42:44,400 --> 01:42:45,900
香诺在哪里
Where's Chenault?

1598
01:42:59,290 --> 01:43:01,210
她去纽约了
She's gone to New York.

1599
01:43:02,630 --> 01:43:04,260
她给我留了一百美元
She left me $100.

1600
01:43:05,050 --> 01:43:06,760
真不敢相信
I don't believe it.

1601
01:43:07,550 --> 01:43:09,300
她一分钱都没有
She didn't have any money.

1602
01:43:09,390 --> 01:43:11,300
你应该拿这钱去找她
You should use it to go with her.

1603
01:43:11,390 --> 01:43:13,100
坐红眼航班  五十块就够了
Red-eye for 50 bucks.

1604
01:43:13,180 --> 01:43:14,270
不
No.

1605
01:43:15,230 --> 01:43:17,100
我哪里都不去
I'm not going anywhere.

1606
01:43:18,350 --> 01:43:21,650
不管怎样  我都要把报纸发行出来
By some means or another, I'm gonna put the paper out.

1607
01:43:21,730 --> 01:43:23,690
把这个混蛋的事印刷出来  然后再走
Print the bastard, then we're gone.

1608
01:43:23,780 --> 01:43:25,690
面对现实吧  保罗
Face the reality, Paul.

1609
01:43:25,950 --> 01:43:27,990
没工作  没钱  没女人
There's no job, no money, no girl,

1610
01:43:28,070 --> 01:43:29,870
还有拘捕我们的传票
and a warrant out for our arrest.

1611
01:43:29,950 --> 01:43:31,160
这已经没什么可争的了
There's no contest.

1612
01:43:31,240 --> 01:43:33,030
多诺万是对的  这不值得斗争
Donovan's right, it ain't worth the fight.

1613
01:43:33,120 --> 01:43:34,370
我不是多诺万
I'm not Donovan!

1614
01:43:34,700 --> 01:43:36,790
我跟别人也不一样
And I'm not like the others.

1615
01:43:37,290 --> 01:43:39,500
我现在告诉你  下次再有油嘴滑舌的笨蛋
I'm telling you right now, next time some greasy moron

1616
01:43:39,580 --> 01:43:42,460
跟我废话  我饶不了他
starts bullshitting me, I'm going after him.

1617
01:43:44,300 --> 01:43:46,800
就算到了美国总统那里也一样
All the way up to the president of the United States.

1618
01:43:48,680 --> 01:43:49,800
我只是想赢一次
I just want to win one once.

1619
01:43:50,300 --> 01:43:51,800
就一张纸
One sheet.

1620
01:43:51,890 --> 01:43:54,180
一百美元你什么也干不了
You ain't gonna get far on $100.

1621
01:43:54,470 --> 01:43:57,020
有些工贼不收钱
Some of the scabs will do it for nothing.

1622
01:43:57,100 --> 01:43:59,900
我们需要二十个人  还有小货车
We're gonna need 20 guys, plus vans.

1623
01:43:59,980 --> 01:44:02,400
不  不  你只需要两千美金
No, no, all you need is two grand.

1624
01:44:04,610 --> 01:44:06,230
我们的朗姆酒喝完了
We're out of rum.

1625
01:44:10,360 --> 01:44:13,160
感觉像是上帝  突然觉得恶心
It's as if God, in a fit of disgust,

1626
01:44:13,580 --> 01:44:15,830
就决定把我们都消灭了
has decided to wipe us all out.

1627
01:44:22,500 --> 01:44:26,170
公鸡打了三次鸣了
Yeah, the cock crows thrice.

1628
01:44:32,260 --> 01:44:34,180
怪兽怎么样
What about El Monstruo?

1629
01:44:36,810 --> 01:44:38,890
我一百美元押怪兽赢
Bet the $100 on El Monstruo.

1630
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:01,540
你怎么知道他住这里
How do you know he lives here?

1631
01:45:01,620 --> 01:45:03,120
我见过他出来
I saw him come out.

1632
01:45:03,210 --> 01:45:05,710
最好让我一个人去
You better let me do this on my own.

1633
01:45:10,130 --> 01:45:12,630
要是他拿到了  我们应该拿到内博老爹那里去
If he gets it, we should bring it to Papa Nebo.

1634
01:45:13,050 --> 01:45:14,180
那是谁
Who's that?

1635
01:45:14,550 --> 01:45:15,720
我的巫医
My witch doctor.

1636
01:45:16,180 --> 01:45:18,060
她是个两性人
She's a hermaphrodite.

1637
01:45:20,480 --> 01:45:22,600
就是这里  就是这里
Stop here! Stop here!

1638
01:45:25,820 --> 01:45:28,270
白天她开垃圾车
By day, she drives a garbage truck.

1639
01:45:29,740 --> 01:45:32,360
晚上她就是内博老爹
By night, she becomes Papa Nebo,

1640
01:45:33,410 --> 01:45:36,070
死灵的两性神使
the hermaphroditic oracle of the dead.

1641
01:45:37,370 --> 01:45:40,450
当墓地守护者萨穆迪老爹
When permission is granted from Papa Samedi,

1642
01:45:41,460 --> 01:45:43,540
同意了
the keeper of the cemetery,

1643
01:45:43,710 --> 01:45:45,170
她就去拜访
she'll visit,

1644
01:45:45,290 --> 01:45:47,380
她挖出一具尸体
and she'll dig up a corpse.

1645
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:50,920
地下尸体身上的器官
Certain organs of the disgrounded stiffs

1646
01:45:51,260 --> 01:45:55,680
在巫术里必不可少
are indispensable for use in ouangas.

1647
01:46:16,490 --> 01:46:18,490
这是胡说的  对吗
This is horseshit, isn't it?

1648
01:46:18,580 --> 01:46:20,290
他治好了我的老二
She cured my prick.

1649
01:46:33,670 --> 01:46:35,630
她想知道你想要什么
She wants to know what you want.

1650
01:46:38,140 --> 01:46:40,760
我们想让她赋予这只鸡能力
We want her to empower this fowl.

1651
01:46:41,720 --> 01:46:43,390
我们希望它得到祝福
We want it blessed

1652
01:46:43,890 --> 01:46:47,770
任何跟它打斗的都要死
and anything that tries to fight it, dead.

1653
01:46:52,610 --> 01:46:54,400
把鸡拿过来
Bring forth the fowl.

1654
01:47:38,990 --> 01:47:42,200
她说  这世上没有任何鸡
She says that no fowl on Earth

1655
01:47:42,280 --> 01:47:45,040
能够挑战它
could challenge this cockerel and survive.

1656
01:47:45,200 --> 01:47:46,250
很好
Great.

1657
01:47:46,330 --> 01:47:47,370
她下诅咒怎么样
How's she off for curses?

1658
01:47:48,500 --> 01:47:50,250
很好
Pretty good.

1659
01:47:50,670 --> 01:47:53,670
那我们诅咒一下桑德森  让他硬不起来
Let's have a curse on Sanderson. Make his dick fall off.

1660
01:47:53,750 --> 01:47:55,170
还有那个银行的混球  格林
And that fucker at the bank, Green.

1661
01:47:55,550 --> 01:47:56,840
格林先生
Mr. Green.

1662
01:48:11,310 --> 01:48:12,400
天哪
Jesus!

1663
01:48:12,520 --> 01:48:13,770
诅咒启动了
Curse active!

1664
01:48:32,920 --> 01:48:34,130
好  来吧
Okay, come on.

1665
01:49:09,580 --> 01:49:10,660
打败一只了  还有两只
One down, two to go.

1666
01:49:10,750 --> 01:49:12,210
好  我去给莫伯格打电话
Okay. I'm gonna call Moburg.

1667
01:49:12,290 --> 01:49:13,420
好吧
Okay.

1668
01:49:22,130 --> 01:49:23,760
快点  快点
Come on. Come on.

1669
01:49:37,150 --> 01:49:38,690
他不在
He isn't there.

1670
01:49:41,530 --> 01:49:42,990
他必须在
He has to be.

1671
01:49:44,820 --> 01:49:46,370
他不在
He isn't there.

1672
01:50:06,720 --> 01:50:08,050
-你去哪里了  -抱歉
- Where have you been? - Sorry.

1673
01:50:08,140 --> 01:50:09,890
我没听见电话
I never heard the phone.

1674
01:50:09,970 --> 01:50:11,020
怎么样了
How's it going?

1675
01:50:11,680 --> 01:50:13,480
赢了  伙计  我们赢了
Winning, man. We're winning.
