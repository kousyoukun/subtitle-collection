Father, we are gathered here
to share this food in your name.

00:01:05,666 --> 00:01:09,083
Bless this food into our bodies, O Lord.

00:01:09,166 --> 00:01:13,000
Bless our hearts
and all that we do, O Lord,

00:01:13,083 --> 00:01:16,000
so that we may walk in your name...

44
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:41,333

Evening, gent. Kindly check your weapon
and enjoy the festivities.

174
00:15:13,333 --> 00:15:15,601
This is Stagecoach Mary's place
and ain't no guns allowed?

175
00:15:15,625 --> 00:15:17,291
'Cept for Mary's, naturally.

176
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:19,083
Naturally.

177
00:15:20,166 --> 00:15:22,916
Naturally, she put a fresh-faced pup
like yourself here to see to it.

178
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,791
Oh, I got to see
to a lot of things, Mr. Love.

179
00:15:25,875 --> 00:15:28,958
People see me and they don't feel
too intimidated by what they see. See?

180
00:15:29,958 --> 00:15:30,875
We familiar?

181
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:34,250
No, but you right famous
around these parts.

182
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:36,453
Folks say you once cut down
three men with one bullet.

183
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:40,625
Now, I ain't met a man
who can do that yet. Excuse me.

184
00:15:40,708 --> 00:15:43,833
Evening, gents. Kindly check your weapons
and enjoy your evening.

185
00:15:43,916 --> 00:15:45,791
I'd sooner check my right arm, boy.

186
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:48,666
Then you can head on over
to Jourdon Anderson's.

187
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:50,875
You can hold your weapon
and drink over there.

188
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:52,875
We drinking here, you puny little fuck.

189
00:15:55,125 --> 00:15:56,333
Hey!

190
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:00,666
Some folk tend to feel a way, regardless.

191
00:16:01,541 --> 00:16:03,541
Get 'em over to Doc Brown's.

192
00:16:03,625 --> 00:16:05,059
Take they guns to the sheriff.

193
00:16:05,083 --> 00:16:06,958
They can get 'em back
when they leave town.

194
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
What they call you?

195
00:16:11,791 --> 00:16:13,208
They call me Cuffee.

196
00:16:28,583 --> 00:16:29,666
This why I'm here!

197
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:32,291

You still ain't talking to me?

221
00:18:26,291 --> 00:18:27,458
Get out.

222
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:30,708
What?

223
00:18:34,208 --> 00:18:35,458
I said leave.

224
00:18:39,208 --> 00:18:40,541
What was that kiss for, then?

225
00:18:41,458 --> 00:18:42,958
To remind you of what it was.

226
00:19:01,208 --> 00:19:03,250
That's to remind you of what it is.

227
00:19:04,875 --> 00:19:05,916
Excuse me.

228
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:08,125
Cuff, clean this man up.

229
00:19:08,208 --> 00:19:10,041
- Oh, yes, ma'am.
- Thank you.

230
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,708
Second floor. Third room on the left.

231
00:19:44,125 --> 00:19:44,958
Mary.

232
00:19:45,041 --> 00:19:48,458
The only thing I need to hear
coming out your mouth is "Goodbye, Mary."

233
00:19:52,583 --> 00:19:54,958
The one thing
you'll never hear me say again.

234
00:19:57,375 --> 00:19:58,833
Till the next time you hear tell

235
00:19:58,916 --> 00:20:01,041
of the whereabouts
of some man that done you dirt.

236
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:04,916
Ain't none of them left.

237
00:20:06,125 --> 00:20:07,833
So you found the Scorpion?

238
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:14,291
Mary, the only thing that mean anything
to me in this world now

239
00:20:15,875 --> 00:20:17,000
is you.

240
00:20:22,833 --> 00:20:24,541
And what about the Nat Love Gang?

241
00:20:26,083 --> 00:20:28,166
Ain't been much of a gang since you left.

242
00:20:29,125 --> 00:20:31,500
Just me, Jim, Bill.

243
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:34,875
Next time they come around, I'll sort it.

244
00:20:36,333 --> 00:20:37,375
Mmm.

245
00:20:38,583 --> 00:20:40,458
You know, I can almost believe that.

246
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:47,041
Almost, 'cause you didn't get
the last one, did you?

247
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:51,875
You can say his name, Mary.

248
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:54,375
What about Rufus Buck?

249
00:20:54,458 --> 00:20:57,833
Rufus in Yuma
for the rest of his natural life.

250
00:20:57,916 --> 00:20:59,708
For a man like him,
that's worse than death.

251
00:21:01,958 --> 00:21:04,333
As long as that man draw breath,

252
00:21:04,416 --> 00:21:07,208
your spirit is gonna be cursed
and wild as it ever was.

253
00:21:07,291 --> 00:21:08,291
Hmm.

254
00:21:08,625 --> 00:21:09,833
I made things,

255
00:21:11,166 --> 00:21:13,916
I built things,
and I ain't gonna risk all that

256
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,500
just because you decide
to come trottin' back.

257
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:18,583
- "Trottin'"?
- Yeah.

258
00:21:19,666 --> 00:21:22,250
- Okay, well.
- Mmm-hmm.

259
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:24,625
I guess I came to the wrong saloon

260
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:27,666
'cause I ain't talking
to the Mary Fields I thought I knew.

261
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:29,541
- Yep. Things have changed.
- I see that.

262
00:21:29,625 --> 00:21:30,625
Mmm-hmm.

263
00:21:31,041 --> 00:21:32,333
'Cause that Mary...

264
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:42,166
That Mary...

265
00:21:44,791 --> 00:21:46,541
...don't shy away from nothin'.

266
00:21:53,375 --> 00:21:55,125
What was it the Apache called you?

267
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,333
Wolf Lady?

268
00:21:57,416 --> 00:22:00,166
No. That's some bullshit
Pickett used to say.

269
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:02,083
That's bullshit Pickett used to say.

270
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,875
- Apache called me Coyote Woman.
- Hmm.

271
00:22:09,083 --> 00:22:13,500
Yeah, Wolf Lady more like it.

272
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
My hat.

273
00:22:35,416 --> 00:22:36,416
There.

274
00:22:50,166 --> 00:22:51,666
I'm coming in.

275
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:54,125
Now, Wolf Lady,
don't blow the head off my neck.

276
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:57,500
- Nat.
- Pickett.

277
00:22:58,416 --> 00:23:00,376
You got the worst timing
in the history of timing.

278
00:23:01,208 --> 00:23:02,583
Oh, y'all was makin' sex?

279
00:23:03,083 --> 00:23:04,125
I apologize.

280
00:23:04,875 --> 00:23:07,125
But what I got to show you can't wait.

281
00:23:10,458 --> 00:23:11,875
Well, well, well.

282
00:23:12,833 --> 00:23:14,916
If it ain't the debonair dipshit himself.

283
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,291
Whoa, easy, Nat.
Listen to what the man got to say first.

284
00:23:17,375 --> 00:23:19,434
So he can tell me
the same stories he been tellin' you?

285
00:23:19,458 --> 00:23:21,000
Why the fuck would I lie?

286
00:23:22,166 --> 00:23:27,083
Rufus Buck is behind bars
for the rest of his life.

287
00:23:28,708 --> 00:23:30,916
- He gettin' out.
- How?

288
00:23:32,375 --> 00:23:33,583
Damned if I know.

289
00:23:34,083 --> 00:23:35,416
I just know it's so.

290
00:23:36,458 --> 00:23:39,041
All the gangs are gettin' set
to ride for him again.

291
00:23:40,041 --> 00:23:42,500
Half that take was his.

292
00:23:43,208 --> 00:23:47,958
And you fools took <i>his </i>money.

293
00:23:50,125 --> 00:23:53,666
You think Rufus Buck
was gonna let you keep half that money,

294
00:23:54,625 --> 00:23:56,333
and you callin' me a fool?

295
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,708
I guess I am.

296
00:24:01,916 --> 00:24:02,916
On your feet.

297
00:24:15,083 --> 00:24:16,083
Exhale.

298
00:24:36,916 --> 00:24:37,958
Now get out of here.

299
00:24:39,666 --> 00:24:40,666
Leave.

300
00:24:41,875 --> 00:24:44,666
What you doin'? We coulda killed
the last of the Crimson Hoods.

301
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:48,208
It's called the Crimson Hood Gang.
You think that's the last one?

302
00:24:57,083 --> 00:24:58,083
Yeah.

303
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:04,416
I woulda bet my left six-shooter
he was about to kill that boy.

304
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:08,125
If that man telling the truth,
Nat just did him a whole lot worse.

00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:31,041
Now let it be known
that I don't particularly enjoy violence.

319
00:27:31,666 --> 00:27:32,708
That being said,

320
00:27:32,791 --> 00:27:36,166
you are currently in the company
of extremely violent individuals.

321
00:27:36,833 --> 00:27:37,833
Try some of that.

322
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:41,166
Ugh. Shit.

323
00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:45,416
So, don't do no stupid shit. All right?

324
00:27:46,291 --> 00:27:49,291
Get off this train now,
you motherless scum.

325
00:27:51,041 --> 00:27:52,500
You must be the hero.

326
00:27:54,208 --> 00:27:56,958
Great Spirit, why is there always one?

327
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
You're rude.

328
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:02,875
I might actually enjoy
inflicting violence on you.

329
00:28:02,958 --> 00:28:04,166
But who knows?

330
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:05,750
Maybe you'll win.

331
00:28:08,041 --> 00:28:08,875
Let's see.

332
00:28:15,333 --> 00:28:16,416
See my point?

333
00:28:17,125 --> 00:28:21,750
Now, step aside so that we may conclude
our business here without further ado.

334
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:29,958
All right, everybody...

335
00:28:37,291 --> 00:28:38,416
Stop right there.

336
00:28:40,291 --> 00:28:41,333
No.

337
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:44,916
I said stop.

338
00:28:47,166 --> 00:28:48,750
Put the weapon down, boy.

339
00:28:50,458 --> 00:28:52,583
Or we kill everybody on this train.

340
00:28:57,666 --> 00:29:00,041
I said put the gun down.

341
00:29:05,208 --> 00:29:06,208
It's okay.

342
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:13,791
Are there any more soldiers on that car?

343
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
There are.

344
00:29:17,458 --> 00:29:18,583
Exactly how many?

345
00:29:19,791 --> 00:29:20,791
Thirty.

346
00:29:21,916 --> 00:29:23,208
Ten!

347
00:29:25,166 --> 00:29:26,958
See, that's all you had to say.

348
00:29:28,208 --> 00:29:29,291
Open the door.

349
00:29:30,666 --> 00:29:32,125
I said open the damn door.

350
00:29:45,833 --> 00:29:47,041
Here we are.

351
00:29:49,791 --> 00:29:50,833
My dear battalion.

352
00:29:53,833 --> 00:29:57,750
I imagine you have
all your artillery aimed at the door.

353
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,375
I'd like to inform you
that in front of that door

354
00:30:01,458 --> 00:30:03,666
lies one of your very own troops.

355
00:30:03,750 --> 00:30:07,416
Any bullets coming through that door
will hit him first, okay?

356
00:30:08,041 --> 00:30:09,375
State your name, criminal.

357
00:30:09,458 --> 00:30:13,250
Oh, I'm not a criminal, sir, um,
but my name is Cherokee Bill.

358
00:30:13,333 --> 00:30:14,458
What's your name?

359
00:30:14,541 --> 00:30:16,875
My name is Officiant of the Goddamn Law.

360
00:30:17,666 --> 00:30:19,500
You let that soldier go immediately.

361
00:30:20,083 --> 00:30:21,875
Leave this train now
and no one will be hurt.

362
00:30:21,958 --> 00:30:26,083
Oh, that sounds like fear talking,
Mr. Officiant of the Goddamn Law.

363
00:30:26,166 --> 00:30:27,916
And we done already hurt a couple people.

364
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,833
You're just going to let us
get away Dred Scott free?

365
00:30:30,916 --> 00:30:32,833
State your purpose, bastard.

366
00:30:32,916 --> 00:30:34,750
Also, I'm not a bastard.

367
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:37,666
But you've got something we want.
We've got a soldier that you want.

368
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:43,083
Now, I suggest we make a peaceful trade
and everybody lives to see another day.

369
00:30:43,166 --> 00:30:45,791
- Sound dandy?
- Just let the boy go.

370
00:30:45,875 --> 00:30:46,750
Jake!

371
00:30:51,791 --> 00:30:53,083
I'm okay, Pa!

372
00:30:53,916 --> 00:30:55,333
That's just a flesh wound, sir.

373
00:30:56,416 --> 00:31:00,125
You got ten seconds to put your guns down
and open up this damn door,

374
00:31:00,208 --> 00:31:01,916
or your little kin here shall perish.

375
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:06,125
Harm him further and I will kill every
last one of you godless sons of bitches.

376
00:31:07,541 --> 00:31:10,083
Goddamn, Trudy.
You know I like my countdowns.

377
00:31:11,250 --> 00:31:15,000
My apologies, sir.
My friend here doesn't like arithmetic.

378
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:17,958
Be that as it may, seven seconds.

379
00:31:21,583 --> 00:31:22,583
Six.

380
00:31:22,625 --> 00:31:25,458
- Lay down your rifles.
- Five.

381
00:31:27,083 --> 00:31:28,625
I said lay them down.

382
00:31:28,708 --> 00:31:29,708
Four.

383
00:31:31,958 --> 00:31:32,958
Three.

384
00:31:42,791 --> 00:31:46,333
Well, all right. Thank you kindly.
Go ahead and walk, boy.

385
00:31:48,916 --> 00:31:52,041
Keep walkin'. Just keep moving.
No one do anything stupid.

386
00:31:52,125 --> 00:31:53,500
Just walk like you been taught.

387
00:31:53,583 --> 00:31:58,041
Left, right, left. Left, right, left.

388
00:31:58,125 --> 00:32:00,083
Left, right, left.

391
00:32:36,333 --> 00:32:38,708
The key is back in Yuma. And the next...

392
00:32:44,916 --> 00:32:46,166
One more time.

393
00:32:46,875 --> 00:32:49,958
You will be hounded

I don't like long distances,
Lieutenant General Abbott.

395
00:32:56,958 --> 00:32:59,666
Ever cross your mind
why you was given the task

396
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:03,750
of transporting a lone outlaw
from one prison to another?

397
00:33:06,458 --> 00:33:12,208
Full pardon for Mr. Buck
and all his associates for all misdeeds.

398
00:33:12,291 --> 00:33:15,500
Signed General George Pryce.

399
00:33:17,958 --> 00:33:18,958
What's this about?

400
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:23,708
Well, he came to us with a proposition.

401
00:33:24,708 --> 00:33:28,333
Kill a particular
Officiant of the Goddamn Law.

402
00:33:29,583 --> 00:33:34,291
A man so crooked that even the government
is embarrassed by his misdeeds.

403
00:33:34,791 --> 00:33:39,166
Apparently, you and your men
wiped out an entire town,

404
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:40,833
women and children included,

405
00:33:41,333 --> 00:33:42,791
to steal silver.

406
00:33:43,583 --> 00:33:46,083
- Now, that's some unscrupulous shit.
- Unscrupulous shit.

407
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:46,333
Please. I'll dis...

00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,333
No!

00:35:53,833 --> 00:35:57,833
Pa! No, no, no, no, no.

411
00:35:58,541 --> 00:35:59,541
Pa.

00:35:59,958 --> 00:36:00,958
No.

Evening, sir. Check your weapon with me
and enjoy what's left of the night.

421
00:37:32,625 --> 00:37:35,750
Oh, no need to show me that star.
I know who you is.

422
00:37:36,666 --> 00:37:40,958
In here, though, I be the sheriff,
and that make Ms. Mary the marshal.

423
00:37:41,041 --> 00:37:43,666
And the marshal say,
"Don't nobody come in here gunned up,

424
00:37:43,750 --> 00:37:45,458
or they might could get gunned down."

425
00:37:46,375 --> 00:37:49,000
My badge begs to differ.

426
00:37:57,791 --> 00:37:59,208
Check your gun-belt.

427
00:38:02,333 --> 00:38:03,333
Excuse me.

428
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:16,375
So how you plan on taking me in, Marshal?

429
00:38:18,041 --> 00:38:19,041
Staring me to death?

430
00:38:19,708 --> 00:38:21,208
How about just death?

431
00:38:27,875 --> 00:38:28,875
Just a pipe.

432
00:38:33,750 --> 00:38:34,750
You mind?

433
00:38:36,541 --> 00:38:38,000
Never known you to touch it.

434
00:38:40,333 --> 00:38:41,708
Only after I kill a man.

435
00:38:43,916 --> 00:38:45,000
Or before.

436
00:38:46,250 --> 00:38:48,208
I was on the trail
of the Crimson Hood Gang

437
00:38:48,291 --> 00:38:50,958
on account of a bank robbery
in Kansas City.

438
00:38:51,041 --> 00:38:53,791
Turned out somebody got to 'em before me.

439
00:38:54,375 --> 00:38:56,000
You know I don't rob banks, Marshal.

440
00:38:56,083 --> 00:38:59,000
But you rob them that do,
which is all the same to me.

441
00:38:59,083 --> 00:39:00,625
- Texas.
- What?

442
00:39:00,708 --> 00:39:02,750
I was in Texas
at the time of that robbery.

443
00:39:02,833 --> 00:39:04,125
How you know when it took place?

444
00:39:04,208 --> 00:39:07,291
Whenever any bank robbery took place,
I was in Texas.

445
00:39:08,958 --> 00:39:11,208
Unless, of course,
the robbery took place in Texas.

446
00:39:13,666 --> 00:39:16,875
Way I hear it, some of them boys
with the Crimson Hoods

447
00:39:17,708 --> 00:39:21,208
are part of a new Rufus Buck Gang, Nat.

448
00:39:21,291 --> 00:39:22,208
Rufus in Yuma.

449
00:39:22,291 --> 00:39:24,833
He out. But you knew that already,
didn't you?

450
00:39:24,916 --> 00:39:27,156
Why you sitting here monologuing,
drinking up my whiskey,

451
00:39:27,208 --> 00:39:29,541
when you should be out
rounding up your little deputies?

452
00:39:30,291 --> 00:39:31,875
'Cause he been pardoned, Nat.

453
00:39:35,375 --> 00:39:39,000
Rufus Buck been absolved
of his countless depredations.

454
00:39:40,291 --> 00:39:44,833
Seeing as I've been scouring the terrain
looking for bank robbers and such,

455
00:39:46,541 --> 00:39:50,250
that particular piece of news
failed to reach me.

456
00:39:52,208 --> 00:39:53,375
What they sayin'?

457
00:39:54,916 --> 00:39:56,833
Something about guns, killin'.

458
00:39:56,916 --> 00:40:00,791
Why you let that kid take my gun?
What kinda stupid rule is that?

459
00:40:00,875 --> 00:40:03,333
- Should be four guns pointing at...
- Shut up, Pickett.

460
00:40:08,833 --> 00:40:11,000
You shoot, he dead.

461
00:40:12,291 --> 00:40:13,500
You miss,

462
00:40:14,333 --> 00:40:15,416
all y'all die.

463
00:40:18,583 --> 00:40:19,791
You, come here.

464
00:40:19,875 --> 00:40:22,583
Take these cuffs. Cuff this man.

465
00:40:22,666 --> 00:40:25,875
Or I put three in his chest right now,
lessen the trouble.

466
00:40:31,250 --> 00:40:32,250
Go on.

467
00:40:35,916 --> 00:40:37,250
Tell this young buck to back up.

468
00:40:37,750 --> 00:40:38,875
Easy, Jim.

469
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,708
Everybody in here know who I am.

470
00:40:43,708 --> 00:40:46,541
I'm taking Nat Love
to Fort Smith to be tried.

471
00:40:47,458 --> 00:40:49,083
Anybody try to follow me,

472
00:40:50,083 --> 00:40:51,458
y'all know what I do.

473
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:54,500
Come on.

474
00:41:00,666 --> 00:41:02,250
Y'all enjoy the rest of the evening.

Rufus.

493
00:42:20,958 --> 00:42:24,916
Cherokee Bill, Ms. Smith,
top of the morning to you both.

494
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:28,583
Mr. Buck, glad to have you
back in Redwood, sir.

495
00:42:33,791 --> 00:42:36,125
Any word on the take
from the Kansas City bank?

496
00:42:36,708 --> 00:42:39,250
The Crimson Hoods took it for $25,000.

497
00:42:39,916 --> 00:42:41,666
But they were ambushed
before they got here.

498
00:42:45,708 --> 00:42:48,791
Everybody knows
it's suicide to take from us.

499
00:42:48,875 --> 00:42:50,833
Someone obviously disagrees.

500
00:42:50,916 --> 00:42:53,583
Goddamn it. That just put us
right back where we started.

501
00:42:53,666 --> 00:42:56,833
How we supposed to build a Mecca
without any bricks?

502
00:42:56,916 --> 00:42:59,083
We gonna have to
take it out of our own bank.

503
00:42:59,583 --> 00:43:01,583
We don't have
that type of money, Trudy.

504
00:43:02,083 --> 00:43:04,625
We only got a few pennies over $2,500.

505
00:43:04,708 --> 00:43:05,750
What did he say?

506
00:43:06,916 --> 00:43:08,541
- 2,500...
- I heard you.

507
00:43:13,041 --> 00:43:14,958
- Wiley.
- Yeah.

508
00:43:20,666 --> 00:43:22,166
Sure is hot, ain't it?

509
00:44:04,458 --> 00:44:05,583
What's up, little man?

510
00:44:06,250 --> 00:44:07,875
- You wanna see something?
- Yeah.

511
00:44:08,458 --> 00:44:10,666
Watch this now.
Don't take your eyes off it.

512
00:44:14,708 --> 00:44:16,708
Oh, it's still there!

513
00:45:00,208 --> 00:45:01,583
Rufus Buck.

514
00:45:03,041 --> 00:45:04,208
Look at you.

515
00:45:05,416 --> 00:45:09,125
Relic of yesteryear with nothin'.

516
00:45:11,208 --> 00:45:14,541
And you think you can roll into my town
and take what belong to me?

517
00:45:15,958 --> 00:45:18,083
Who the fuck you think I am, huh?

518
00:45:19,583 --> 00:45:22,166
Ain't nobody scared of you
and ain't nobody runnin'.

519
00:45:23,166 --> 00:45:25,083
I'm a sinister motherfucker too.

520
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:29,958
One click of my finger and you disappear.

521
00:45:32,250 --> 00:45:34,000
So I suggest you leave...

522
00:45:36,125 --> 00:45:37,625
before I finish my steak.

523
00:45:40,875 --> 00:45:43,315
And if you even think about sticking...

524
00:45:45,833 --> 00:45:46,916
Come in.

525
00:45:49,666 --> 00:45:50,916
What is it, Carson?

526
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
Sheriff, Mr. Buck wants
to see you out front.

527
00:45:56,916 --> 00:45:59,041
Tell that man
I ain't got nothing to say to him.

528
00:46:01,208 --> 00:46:02,291
It wasn't a request.

529
00:46:11,416 --> 00:46:12,708
Wiley Escoe.

530
00:46:14,791 --> 00:46:15,791
Rufus.

531
00:46:16,541 --> 00:46:19,250
You wanna sell this town
while I rot in prison?

532
00:46:20,541 --> 00:46:22,083
The world you knew is gone.

533
00:46:24,458 --> 00:46:25,750
There's a flood comin'.

534
00:46:26,750 --> 00:46:29,458
Do you think
you can hold onto this place when it hit?

535
00:46:30,958 --> 00:46:33,500
At least I know enough
to get mine and get out.

536
00:46:35,458 --> 00:46:36,458
Kill me...

537
00:46:38,833 --> 00:46:40,208
and you'll have nothing.

538
00:46:42,250 --> 00:46:45,958
You know, a man like you
will have us all subservient

539
00:46:46,041 --> 00:46:47,875
till the end of our days

540
00:46:47,958 --> 00:46:50,833
so's long as you can buy yourself a house,

541
00:46:50,916 --> 00:46:52,000
a badge,

542
00:46:52,916 --> 00:46:54,708
and them goddamn gold teeth.

543
00:47:00,375 --> 00:47:01,666
You want to do this here?

544
00:47:09,416 --> 00:47:11,750
There you go.
That's what you want, right?

545
00:47:12,375 --> 00:47:13,916
That's what you came here for?

546
00:47:14,541 --> 00:47:17,041
I won't disappoint you. Come on.

547
00:47:18,250 --> 00:47:20,916
That's what you want. Want some more?

548
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:23,583
You want some more, right?
You want some more?

549
00:47:33,166 --> 00:47:34,875
Come here, motherfucker.

550
00:47:36,125 --> 00:47:37,333
Here you go.

551
00:47:41,041 --> 00:47:43,083
Oh shit. I done hit gold.

552
00:47:43,666 --> 00:47:46,916
Hey, boy. Come here.
Come, get that gold. Get that gold.

553
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:49,833
All right. Tell your mama
you rich now! Go ahead!

554
00:48:03,291 --> 00:48:06,500
Now,
I ain't gonna kill you, Wiley.

555
00:48:07,958 --> 00:48:09,791
You and I were friends once.

556
00:48:11,375 --> 00:48:12,500
But know this.

557
00:48:13,208 --> 00:48:15,750
Redwood will never be yours, never.

558
00:48:16,458 --> 00:48:17,458
Never.

559
00:48:17,875 --> 00:48:21,041
Matter of fact,
you ain't welcome here no more.

560
00:48:23,208 --> 00:48:24,208
Now...

561
00:48:26,708 --> 00:48:30,000
I want you to vacate immediately
or die where you lay.

562
00:48:32,875 --> 00:48:33,875
Say what?

563
00:48:43,958 --> 00:48:44,958
That's right.

573
00:50:04,875 --> 00:50:05,875
Yep.

574
00:50:11,666 --> 00:50:14,916
Tell me something.
How you know Rufus will be in Redwood?

575
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,080
He's taking that money
from them Crimson Hoods.

576
00:50:17,125 --> 00:50:18,541
That's where he'll be.

577
00:50:18,625 --> 00:50:21,166
Now you teaming up
with a marshal to bring him in.

578
00:50:21,250 --> 00:50:22,976
I ain't bringing him in.
I'm bringing him down.

579
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:24,666
And we ain't teaming up, old man.

580
00:50:25,750 --> 00:50:28,333
Your life's expendable, Marshal.
My gang's ain't.

581
00:50:30,416 --> 00:50:32,458
Shit, since we're out here,
I oughta tell you...

582
00:50:35,583 --> 00:50:37,125
I was fixin' to kill you...

583
00:50:39,375 --> 00:50:41,333
when you and your fellas brought in Rufus.

584
00:50:42,458 --> 00:50:44,208
A lot of men be fixin', son.

585
00:50:44,791 --> 00:50:47,166
They always seem to die
before they get the job done.

586
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,041
Just for the record...

587
00:50:52,666 --> 00:50:54,291
I took Rufus in alone.

588
00:51:14,208 --> 00:51:15,291
Mary.

589
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:19,000
I figured you'd be halfway
to Fort Smith by now.

590
00:51:19,083 --> 00:51:22,500
You can put that gun down, Marshal.
This ain't a ambush.

591
00:51:23,625 --> 00:51:26,791
You, on the other hand,
might wanna keep yours handy.

592
00:51:28,291 --> 00:51:29,791
Do you think I'm stupid enough

593
00:51:29,875 --> 00:51:32,583
to fall for that bullshit
y'all pulled in my saloon?

594
00:51:32,666 --> 00:51:34,458
I don't want you mixed up in this no more.

595
00:51:35,291 --> 00:51:36,750
Then you shoulda told me so.

596
00:51:37,375 --> 00:51:40,125
I must confess
to some raw feelings myself.

597
00:51:40,875 --> 00:51:43,500
This ain't no road
to ask a friend to travel.

598
00:51:43,583 --> 00:51:46,583
Now you take that money
we took off them Crimson Hoods

599
00:51:46,666 --> 00:51:48,958
and you buy that ranch
you always blabbing about. Hmm?

600
00:51:49,041 --> 00:51:52,541
That's mighty generous of you,
but that ain't how this gang work.

601
00:51:52,625 --> 00:51:56,000
Take stays in the usual place, ready
to be shared three ways when we come back.

602
00:51:56,083 --> 00:51:57,958
Ain't no coming back from this.

603
00:51:59,791 --> 00:52:00,875
Now get out of here.

604
00:52:01,958 --> 00:52:03,375
All of you. This ain't your fight.

605
00:52:03,458 --> 00:52:06,458
You take on the Devil himself, you gonna
need more than you and the marshal.

606
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,458
I seen the Devil,
and Rufus Buck ain't him.

607
00:52:10,625 --> 00:52:11,625
Devil's white.

608
00:52:13,166 --> 00:52:15,125
You got a reason you wanna die, Jim?

609
00:52:16,291 --> 00:52:18,041
Outside of you saving me from this?

610
00:52:20,166 --> 00:52:23,416
Besides, Monroe said
Cherokee Bill run with Rufus.

611
00:52:24,166 --> 00:52:25,541
Every time I speak on my speed,

612
00:52:25,625 --> 00:52:28,333
a motherfucker wanna pull
Cherokee Bill out they ass.

613
00:52:28,416 --> 00:52:30,666
I'ma put a end to that argument
once and for all.

614
00:52:30,750 --> 00:52:34,166
Like they say in the <i>Book of Clarence,</i>
"No man out-speed me."

615
00:52:34,250 --> 00:52:36,291
Out-speed ain't a word,
and Clarence ain't no book.

616
00:52:36,375 --> 00:52:38,935
I'm hopin' Cherokee put a bullet
in your ass just to shut you up.

617
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,125
- Hey.
- You left these on my wall, Mr. Love.

618
00:52:41,833 --> 00:52:43,753
Figured we going after villains,
you'll need 'em.

619
00:52:43,791 --> 00:52:44,791
Obliged.

620
00:53:12,875 --> 00:53:14,458
What y'all waiting around for?

621
00:53:16,166 --> 00:53:17,958
You think destiny is comin' to you?

622
00:53:18,583 --> 00:53:19,916
Hyup! Go!

623
00:53:28,041 --> 00:53:30,875
Yeah. I know.

624
00:53:35,500 --> 00:53:36,500

636
00:54:23,458 --> 00:54:24,625
Everybody out there?

637
00:54:26,083 --> 00:54:27,166
Just about.

638
00:54:30,958 --> 00:54:32,250
How could you do it?

639
00:54:33,833 --> 00:54:36,166
Leave all of this to Wiley?

640
00:54:39,750 --> 00:54:41,208
If you were runnin' Redwood,

641
00:54:42,583 --> 00:54:44,416
who woulda kept the operation goin'?

642
00:54:45,958 --> 00:54:48,166
Who else woulda kept
all them gangs in line?

643
00:54:48,750 --> 00:54:54,250
Look, I know that Wiley got his ways,
but he was loyal once.

644
00:54:55,791 --> 00:54:58,083
Loyalty is a virtue, Rufus.

645
00:54:59,041 --> 00:55:00,041
Till it ain't.

646
00:55:03,833 --> 00:55:04,875
You loyal to me?

647
00:55:17,291 --> 00:55:18,500
See these folk here?

648
00:55:20,041 --> 00:55:22,458
Either they can't see it
or they don't want to.

649
00:55:24,416 --> 00:55:26,416
But I believe in what you're doing.

650
00:55:27,375 --> 00:55:29,833
This place can be
the promised land for us.

651
00:55:30,750 --> 00:55:34,125
And as long as that so, ain't nothing
I won't do to see it through.

652
00:55:43,041 --> 00:55:44,041
You tell them.

653
00:56:04,708 --> 00:56:06,916
Citizens of Redwood.

654
00:56:08,375 --> 00:56:10,166
A new day is dawning.

655
00:56:11,250 --> 00:56:13,416
As by now you have doubtless learned,

656
00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:17,291
the territory will officially
open up for settlement.

657
00:56:18,750 --> 00:56:22,625
Now they say everything we own
is gonna stay our own.

658
00:56:23,333 --> 00:56:26,000
But you know as well as I do
how much that's worth.

659
00:56:27,500 --> 00:56:31,375
See, your land,
your businesses, your homes

660
00:56:31,458 --> 00:56:34,333
has all been promised
to the highest bidders

661
00:56:34,416 --> 00:56:37,875
by your one-time sheriff, Wiley Escoe.

662
00:56:39,500 --> 00:56:42,333
Now, Mr. Buck can prevent this
from happening.

663
00:56:42,916 --> 00:56:45,958
But in order for us to do that,
it's necessary that we levy a tax.

664
00:56:46,041 --> 00:56:47,708
At what cost to us?

665
00:56:48,375 --> 00:56:50,916
- $50,000.
- Ooh.

666
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:55,583
You could scrape every penny
from every living soul in this town,

667
00:56:55,666 --> 00:56:57,416
and it wouldn't come near to that.

668
00:56:57,500 --> 00:56:59,250
You got us between a rock
and a hard place.

669
00:56:59,916 --> 00:57:01,958
How long you been alive in this country?

670
00:57:02,750 --> 00:57:05,750
A rock and a hard place
is what we call Monday.

671
00:57:06,583 --> 00:57:08,166
I've heard of Rufus Buck.

672
00:57:08,750 --> 00:57:10,458
How bad a man he is.

673
00:57:11,375 --> 00:57:13,583
But he got himself
thrown in jail once before,

674
00:57:14,291 --> 00:57:17,041
and I reckon
he'll be back there again soon enough.

675
00:57:17,958 --> 00:57:21,375
When he is,
maybe I'll come back to this town.

676
00:57:22,166 --> 00:57:23,583
'Cause I ain't paying shit.

677
00:57:24,541 --> 00:57:26,458
You think I made Redwood for myself?

678
00:57:30,291 --> 00:57:31,291
To what end?

679
00:57:33,166 --> 00:57:35,791
Redwood ain't a hiding place,
'cause I don't hide.

680
00:57:38,041 --> 00:57:39,291
It ain't a dream.

681
00:57:39,791 --> 00:57:40,875
I don't dream.

682
00:57:42,375 --> 00:57:43,500
You know what it is?

683
00:57:45,125 --> 00:57:46,125
It's an example.

684
00:57:48,416 --> 00:57:49,666
It's an example...

685
00:57:51,875 --> 00:57:53,291
for others to follow.

686
00:57:55,125 --> 00:57:56,250
And you...

687
00:57:57,708 --> 00:58:01,125
you are an enemy of progress.

688
00:58:03,750 --> 00:58:05,875
Please. Please.

689
00:58:07,708 --> 00:58:09,916
- I got a family.
- What's your name?

690
00:58:11,416 --> 00:58:12,708
James.

691
00:58:19,583 --> 00:58:21,041
Rest in peace, James.

692
00:58:25,166 --> 00:58:27,708
Now, how much?

693
00:58:28,833 --> 00:58:30,625
How much can be gathered?

694
00:58:31,541 --> 00:58:32,708
Ten thousand.

695
00:58:33,500 --> 00:58:35,666
Maybe 15,
if every last cent can be squeezed.

696
00:58:35,750 --> 00:58:36,750
Mmm-hmm.

697
00:58:37,583 --> 00:58:40,541
Ain't nobody leave town
until we collect it all.

698
00:58:41,291 --> 00:58:43,333
And if you fail to comply,

699
00:58:43,916 --> 00:58:47,833
you and everything you love will burn.

700
00:59:10,833 --> 00:59:12,500
I ain't got nothin' to rob.

701
00:59:14,166 --> 00:59:15,958
But I got somebody to shoot.

702
00:59:16,458 --> 00:59:17,458
Step down.

703
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:25,208
Wiley Escoe.

704
00:59:26,041 --> 00:59:27,083
Bass Reeves.

705
00:59:27,833 --> 00:59:28,833
Fuck.

706
00:59:29,333 --> 00:59:31,166
Redwood crawling with gunmen.

707
00:59:31,250 --> 00:59:33,916
Rufus came with 12 and took six of mine.

708
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:35,708
Who knows how many he got by now.

709
00:59:35,791 --> 00:59:38,166
I don't believe a thing this man sayin'.

710
00:59:38,666 --> 00:59:39,666
He a scout.

711
00:59:40,125 --> 00:59:41,625
I say we kill him.

712
00:59:42,625 --> 00:59:44,250
And we take the rest of them teeth.

713
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:46,583
You ever shot a sheriff, boy?

714
00:59:47,500 --> 00:59:48,500
A mayor?

715
00:59:49,625 --> 00:59:51,708
Little harder than shootin' regular folk.

716
00:59:52,500 --> 00:59:53,500
And I'm both.

717
00:59:53,583 --> 00:59:57,708
You both alive and dead
'cause Rufus don't like loose ends.

718
00:59:58,333 --> 01:00:02,291
Law don't find a man like Rufus Buck
unless you got inside information.

719
01:00:02,375 --> 01:00:03,583
Ain't that right, Wiley?

720
01:00:04,458 --> 01:00:07,166
If I had my way, you'd be right up
under the jail next to Rufus.

721
01:00:07,958 --> 01:00:10,666
But you cut yourself a deal,
wound up wearing a badge instead.

722
01:00:10,750 --> 01:00:14,291
You got your reasons
you want Rufus gone, and I got mine.

723
01:00:15,125 --> 01:00:17,041
Ain't the enemy of my enemy my friend?

724
01:00:17,958 --> 01:00:21,541
Rufus tryin' to save Redwood.
But for that, he need money.

725
01:00:22,333 --> 01:00:23,791
And that's one thing he ain't have.

726
01:00:23,875 --> 01:00:27,541
All right, look here.
You made a deal with the Devil.

727
01:00:30,416 --> 01:00:31,583
Now he come to collect.

728
01:00:33,666 --> 01:00:34,666
You rest up,

729
01:00:35,208 --> 01:00:36,500
but be gone before sunup.

730
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,666
Or it's gonna go from bad to badder.
You hear?

731
01:00:57,875 --> 01:00:58,875
Ooh.

732
01:01:03,250 --> 01:01:04,458
Marshal.

733
01:01:05,166 --> 01:01:07,500
Marshal. Marshal.

734
01:01:07,583 --> 01:01:09,416
All them tricks'll get you killed, son.

735
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:12,375
Listen, Marshal.

736
01:01:12,958 --> 01:01:16,125
I'm faster than any weapon.
You can trust in that.

737
01:01:16,208 --> 01:01:17,375
I seen faster.

738
01:01:18,916 --> 01:01:21,083
All right. Where?

739
01:01:21,708 --> 01:01:22,916
In the mirror.

740
01:01:26,875 --> 01:01:28,541
Negro said, "In the mirror."

741
01:01:28,625 --> 01:01:29,791
I'm so... I'm sorry.

742
01:01:29,875 --> 01:01:33,791
I rather ride into a gun battle
on a dark horse over a golden stallion.

743
01:01:35,583 --> 01:01:38,625
- Fuck that mean?
- Shiny shit get shot.

744
01:01:39,791 --> 01:01:40,791
You gonna shoot me?

745
01:01:43,666 --> 01:01:45,625
What you think about that, lawman?

746
01:01:46,416 --> 01:01:48,125
I think y'all gonna die.

Information from where?

755
01:02:37,083 --> 01:02:38,083
Redwood.

756
01:02:39,250 --> 01:02:41,500
You know we can't trust Wiley's word.

757
01:02:41,583 --> 01:02:45,250
Someone's got to get the lay of the land
before we make our next move.

758
01:02:45,333 --> 01:02:47,500
Yeah, Mary, but that somebody
ain't got to be you.

In case you forgot,

763
01:02:55,958 --> 01:03:00,166
your face more famous than all of ours
put together, Stagecoach Mary.

764
01:03:00,750 --> 01:03:02,833
Got it up on advertisements
for that saloon of yours

765
01:03:02,916 --> 01:03:03,958
from here to Texas.

766
01:03:04,708 --> 01:03:07,416
Which is why I can
ride into town in plain sight.

767
01:03:08,333 --> 01:03:10,666
Everybody knows I'm buying saloons.

768
01:03:10,750 --> 01:03:13,583
Rufus need money. I'ma make him an offer
on Trudy Smith's place...

769
01:03:13,666 --> 01:03:16,416
Mary, what in my character
makes you think I'll allow that?

770
01:03:17,833 --> 01:03:19,666
I'm not asking for your permission.

771
01:03:24,958 --> 01:03:26,000
All right.

772
01:03:28,291 --> 01:03:30,708
Then I... I guess
I'll just be asking you for yours.

773
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:34,750
Since you'll never let
a man give you away,

774
01:03:34,833 --> 01:03:37,291
I just have to ask you direct.

775
01:03:45,750 --> 01:03:47,875
That's the ring my father gave my mother.

776
01:03:50,166 --> 01:03:52,125
I was gonna give it to you
back in Douglas.

777
01:03:54,750 --> 01:03:56,041
But you didn't.

778
01:03:59,083 --> 01:04:00,250
I am now.

779
01:04:04,875 --> 01:04:06,958
I used to hate feeling helpless over you.

780
01:04:09,083 --> 01:04:10,625
Those days are over now.

781
01:04:12,750 --> 01:04:13,750
Mary...

782
01:04:15,208 --> 01:04:18,333
When the dust settles,
we gonna go our separate ways, for good.

783
01:04:22,375 --> 01:04:25,000
But not till the dust settles.
I'm here till then.

784
01:04:52,375 --> 01:04:53,375

You don't own a gun
confident enough to ask where I reside.

01:06:10,833 --> 01:06:14,375
I prefer Treacherous Trudy myself,
but I'll take it.

797
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:16,541
What brings you to my town?

798
01:06:18,750 --> 01:06:20,708
I heard Rufus Buck was back.

799
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,291
News travels fast.

800
01:06:24,375 --> 01:06:26,541
I have an offer he might wanna hear about.

801
01:06:28,166 --> 01:06:29,375
Well, any offer you got,

802
01:06:30,791 --> 01:06:32,375
you can make it to me.

803
01:06:34,416 --> 01:06:36,166
I don't do business with the help.

804
01:06:40,125 --> 01:06:41,541
Give me that shit.

805
01:06:49,541 --> 01:06:51,708
Lead the way, Treacherous Trudy.

01:08:28,791 --> 01:08:30,291
Speak your piece.

822
01:08:32,541 --> 01:08:34,375
I assume you know who I am.

823
01:08:36,375 --> 01:08:38,458
I assume you know who I used to run with.

824
01:08:45,291 --> 01:08:47,166
Those days are over for me anyhow,

825
01:08:48,250 --> 01:08:50,583
but I didn't get to be
Stagecoach Mary Fields

826
01:08:50,666 --> 01:08:54,166
without having my ears to the ground

827
01:08:54,916 --> 01:08:58,333
and my ears tell me you just lost
25 thou that was coming your way.

828
01:09:00,541 --> 01:09:02,583
I hope your proposal
rivals your nerve...

829
01:09:02,666 --> 01:09:05,250
Allow me the latitude of completion.

830
01:09:09,083 --> 01:09:11,166
My saloon in Douglas is boomin'.

831
01:09:11,708 --> 01:09:14,875
Bought me another one in the Elks,
and I got a restaurant in Cascade too.

832
01:09:15,458 --> 01:09:18,083
For the sum of all that,
I could take this one off your hands.

833
01:09:21,750 --> 01:09:24,958
The mere mention of my name
brings forth good business

834
01:09:25,458 --> 01:09:27,833
to any establishment attached, whereas,

835
01:09:28,375 --> 01:09:32,833
with all due respect,
but the name Rufus Buck instils fear.

836
01:09:37,833 --> 01:09:39,041
We know who you are.

837
01:09:42,333 --> 01:09:48,666
You walkin' into my town
with that proposal is risky.

838
01:09:49,625 --> 01:09:54,083
The kind of risk a woman such as yourself
wouldn't tie herself to

839
01:09:54,166 --> 01:09:56,291
unless there was
a whole lot more at stake.

840
01:09:58,416 --> 01:10:00,958
See, I don't believe in coincidence,

841
01:10:01,708 --> 01:10:03,083
like you just gonna walk in here

842
01:10:03,166 --> 01:10:06,708
right after the Crimson Hoods
get ambushed with my money.

843
01:10:08,916 --> 01:10:10,208
What are you thinking?

844
01:10:15,583 --> 01:10:16,666
Oops.

845
01:10:17,250 --> 01:10:19,416
You must have forgot
whose name is on the door.

846
01:10:21,541 --> 01:10:22,875
Another round.

847
01:10:23,416 --> 01:10:25,916
We havin' a party, y'all. Come on.

848
01:11:12,416 --> 01:11:13,541
All right, Mary.

849
01:11:15,666 --> 01:11:16,666
All right.

850
01:11:20,041 --> 01:11:22,958
So you still sayin'
you don't know nothin' about that money

851
01:11:23,041 --> 01:11:24,500
and you done come here alone?

852
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:27,000
That's right.

853
01:11:27,833 --> 01:11:31,041
You done rode all the way over here
to get yourself killed.

854
01:11:31,833 --> 01:11:32,875
And for what?

855
01:11:33,875 --> 01:11:34,875
For love?

856
01:11:35,833 --> 01:11:38,166
Love is the only thing worth dying for.

857
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,125
But you wouldn't know anything about that.

858
01:11:48,083 --> 01:11:49,083
You know,

859
01:11:50,291 --> 01:11:52,166
I had a sister named Mary.

860
01:11:58,583 --> 01:12:03,291
She was pretty, strong-willed, like you.

861
01:12:05,833 --> 01:12:07,375
She died of polio when I was 11.

862
01:12:09,541 --> 01:12:12,958
Always was in pain,
but she'd never let me see her cry.

863
01:12:13,916 --> 01:12:14,916
Mmm.

864
01:12:16,708 --> 01:12:19,750
There's this girl called Hope lived by us.

865
01:12:20,750 --> 01:12:24,083
Big fat kid,
always picking on the smaller kids.

866
01:12:24,833 --> 01:12:26,625
Obviously out of jealousy.

867
01:12:27,833 --> 01:12:29,666
But she ain't never fuck with me though.

868
01:12:31,500 --> 01:12:33,416
She hated Mary with a passion,

869
01:12:34,250 --> 01:12:38,583
always teasing her
about how thin and frail she was.

870
01:12:39,791 --> 01:12:41,083
Then one day,

871
01:12:42,125 --> 01:12:44,583
Hope walkin' by our house,

872
01:12:45,250 --> 01:12:48,000
apple in one hand, blade in the other.

873
01:12:50,583 --> 01:12:54,083
She decided to throw the apple
across the street at Mary,

874
01:12:55,291 --> 01:12:59,208
and it hit my sister in the head
and knocked her out of balance.

875
01:12:59,291 --> 01:13:00,875
She fell down the steps.

876
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:04,291
Broke her ankle.

877
01:13:05,500 --> 01:13:06,500
And now that...

878
01:13:07,666 --> 01:13:11,666
that was the first and only time
I physically seen my sister cry.

879
01:13:13,625 --> 01:13:17,791
And there was Hope standing there
laughin' her ugly fuckin' face off.

880
01:13:21,833 --> 01:13:22,833
My daddy...

881
01:13:25,958 --> 01:13:27,333
he got home,

882
01:13:29,166 --> 01:13:34,041
he took off his belt, and he beat <i>me</i>
for not protecting my sister.

883
01:13:36,125 --> 01:13:39,208
He lashed me
until my whole body went numb.

884
01:13:42,166 --> 01:13:43,166
Then

885
01:13:44,291 --> 01:13:47,125
he went to Hope house
to do the same thing to her.

886
01:13:49,333 --> 01:13:54,166
When he got there, he saw her whole family
standin' on the side of the house,

887
01:13:54,250 --> 01:13:56,583
all of 'em screamin' and cryin',

888
01:13:58,666 --> 01:13:59,958
and there was Hope...

889
01:14:02,250 --> 01:14:04,458
lyin' on the floor in a pool of blood.

890
01:14:06,250 --> 01:14:09,208
Somebody had slit her throat.

891
01:14:10,583 --> 01:14:12,125
Killed her with her own knife.

892
01:14:16,916 --> 01:14:19,041
Daddy was speechless.

893
01:14:19,791 --> 01:14:22,708
He ain't said a word to me
when he came home.

894
01:14:24,333 --> 01:14:25,458
The next day,

895
01:14:26,583 --> 01:14:28,791
he sent me to live with my grandparents.

896
01:14:30,375 --> 01:14:32,875
And then the next time I seen my sister,

897
01:14:34,291 --> 01:14:36,208
she was laying in a coffin.

898
01:14:38,375 --> 01:14:39,875
Disease had killed her.

899
01:14:47,125 --> 01:14:49,458
I'm sorry your sister had to suffer.

900
01:14:53,833 --> 01:14:55,666
I admire her bravery.

901
01:14:59,375 --> 01:15:01,625
But you get no words from me.

902
01:15:04,666 --> 01:15:05,666
You know,

903
01:15:06,458 --> 01:15:08,958
I actually admire <i>your</i> bravery.

904
01:15:13,250 --> 01:15:15,666
But I'm afraid the outcome
is still the outcome.

905
01:15:16,583 --> 01:15:17,625
Hope

906
01:15:18,750 --> 01:15:19,875
must die.

907
01:15:34,208 --> 01:15:35,208
But not yet.

908
01:15:49,416 --> 01:15:52,541
Leave her out here in the street
so everybody can see her.

909
01:15:52,625 --> 01:15:55,833
No one come to collect her 'fore sunup,
put a bullet in her head.

910
01:15:55,916 --> 01:15:56,916
Yes, ma'am.

911
01:15:58,666 --> 01:16:00,458
Looks like we don't
have to wait that long.

912
01:16:35,083 --> 01:16:36,541
Whoever die first, right?

913
01:16:37,166 --> 01:16:39,125
- Whoever die first.
- Mmm-hmm.

914
01:16:43,083 --> 01:16:44,083
Get her up.

915
01:16:45,875 --> 01:16:47,500
"Whoever die first"?

916
01:16:49,208 --> 01:16:51,291
Now, what kind of dumbass saying is that?

917
01:16:52,125 --> 01:16:53,666
You two trying to get shot out here?

918
01:16:55,166 --> 01:16:58,166
Nat Love. How predictable.

919
01:16:59,083 --> 01:17:02,708
You predict my friend Bill Pickett
aiming at your bowler cap?

920
01:17:05,125 --> 01:17:07,333
You'll be dead
before your boys get their aim.

921
01:17:07,416 --> 01:17:09,000
And you die right after.

922
01:17:10,791 --> 01:17:13,375
But your boss won't see
one red cent of that money.

923
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:15,208
My boss?

924
01:17:16,291 --> 01:17:17,291
Where is he?

925
01:17:18,708 --> 01:17:20,000
Where is who?

926
01:17:20,541 --> 01:17:21,541
Marshal.

927
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:24,375
I'm speakin' English, yeah?

928
01:17:24,458 --> 01:17:26,541
- Sound like English to me.
- Mmm-hmm.

929
01:17:26,625 --> 01:17:28,208
Where's Rufus Buck?

930
01:17:28,875 --> 01:17:29,875
Oh.

931
01:17:30,625 --> 01:17:31,625
Ooh-hoo.

932
01:17:34,708 --> 01:17:35,708
Bass.

933
01:17:36,291 --> 01:17:37,333
Trudy.

934
01:17:37,416 --> 01:17:40,958
If I'd known you were switchin' sides,
I'da asked you to come join us.

935
01:17:45,375 --> 01:17:47,500
You here for your damsel in distress?

936
01:18:00,666 --> 01:18:02,958
You don't look hard of hearing.

937
01:18:04,583 --> 01:18:05,583
So I'ma ask you again.

938
01:18:07,291 --> 01:18:08,666
Where's Rufus Buck?

939
01:18:09,541 --> 01:18:12,333
Well, clearly, you don't know me.

940
01:18:14,791 --> 01:18:16,125
Tell your men to go,

941
01:18:17,125 --> 01:18:18,625
but you stay,

942
01:18:19,791 --> 01:18:22,541
and maybe your damsel
will live a little longer.

943
01:18:31,791 --> 01:18:32,791
Marshal.

944
01:18:36,625 --> 01:18:37,625
Oh.

945
01:18:38,208 --> 01:18:39,458
You're pretty though.

946
01:18:43,166 --> 01:18:45,500
- Ah, take her ass back in there.
- Yes, ma'am.

947
01:18:45,583 --> 01:18:47,083
Gonna get me a drink.

948
01:18:47,166 --> 01:18:48,166
Hey.

949
01:18:48,875 --> 01:18:50,955
That the quick draw
I hear tell about, Cherokee Bill?

950
01:18:52,041 --> 01:18:55,041
I hear you so fast
that your opponents ain't got time to draw

951
01:18:55,875 --> 01:18:57,666
before you put two in they back.

952
01:18:59,250 --> 01:19:00,583
No, that ain't me.

953
01:19:01,625 --> 01:19:05,083
I'm the Cherokee Bill that shoots men
in the mouth that talk too much.

954
01:19:06,875 --> 01:19:08,500
I'll make it easy for you, then.

955
01:19:09,666 --> 01:19:10,791
You draw first.

956
01:19:12,666 --> 01:19:15,750
That what you think this is?
"Who the quickest draw in the West?"

957
01:19:15,833 --> 01:19:17,750
All comes down
to who fast and who ain't, right?

958
01:19:17,833 --> 01:19:21,333
No, it all comes down
to who's alive and who's dead.

959
01:19:24,375 --> 01:19:26,208
Trudy, I'm gonna get me
something to drink.

960
01:19:27,791 --> 01:19:28,708
Good night.

961
01:19:29,958 --> 01:19:31,708
Hey, hey, drink, my ass, man.

962
01:19:31,791 --> 01:19:33,750
- I practiced that standoff all night.
- Jim.

963
01:19:33,833 --> 01:19:36,267
- You're not about to walk away.
- Get out of here.

964
01:19:36,291 --> 01:19:37,976
- No, nobody...
- Get out of here, Jim.

965
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,000
- That chicken...
- It ain't the time.

966
01:19:40,500 --> 01:19:41,541
Okay. Okay.

967
01:19:47,208 --> 01:19:48,208
March, boy.

968
01:19:48,625 --> 01:19:50,833
- I said march!
- March.

969
01:19:52,666 --> 01:19:56,750
Hup, two, three, four.

970
01:20:15,416 --> 01:20:16,416
That's enough.

971
01:20:42,666 --> 01:20:43,750
They beat you bad?

972
01:20:52,375 --> 01:20:53,791
I'ma kill 'em all.

973
01:21:49,250 --> 01:21:51,416
You familiar with Napoleon?

974
01:21:56,583 --> 01:22:00,166
He said, "I am driven towards an end
that I do not know."

975
01:22:01,416 --> 01:22:02,625
"As I reach it,

976
01:22:03,416 --> 01:22:05,416
as I shall become unnecessary,

977
01:22:06,708 --> 01:22:09,625
an atom shall suffice to shatter me."

978
01:22:11,125 --> 01:22:15,708
"Until then, all forces of humankind
can do nothing to stop me."

979
01:22:18,166 --> 01:22:20,333
That's a man who knew exactly who he was.

980
01:22:21,708 --> 01:22:23,083
Most importantly,

981
01:22:24,500 --> 01:22:26,750
he knew that
his time would come to an end.

982
01:22:30,708 --> 01:22:31,708
Cut him down.

983
01:22:41,250 --> 01:22:42,250
You know why...

984
01:22:44,208 --> 01:22:45,791
I gave you that scar?

985
01:22:47,958 --> 01:22:49,291
So I'd remember you.

986
01:22:53,333 --> 01:22:54,333
No.

987
01:22:55,541 --> 01:22:59,833
No, I gave you that scar so I can know
your face when you come back to me.

988
01:23:01,791 --> 01:23:03,000
Nat Love,

989
01:23:04,250 --> 01:23:06,500
the outlaw who robs outlaws,

990
01:23:07,875 --> 01:23:14,500
the angel of death who hunts down those
who trespass against him with no mercy.

991
01:23:14,583 --> 01:23:16,041
I know who you are.

992
01:23:17,708 --> 01:23:20,000
And I see the line that you won't cross.

993
01:23:22,333 --> 01:23:24,375
See, I know what's on the other side.

994
01:23:29,875 --> 01:23:31,166
Apologize for the beating.

995
01:23:33,500 --> 01:23:35,958
It was more of an indication
for what Ms. Fields might see

996
01:23:36,041 --> 01:23:38,333
if we fail to come to terms.

997
01:23:40,958 --> 01:23:42,291
What terms?

998
01:23:43,458 --> 01:23:47,250
You will return the money
you stole from me by Friday noon.

999
01:23:47,333 --> 01:23:48,625
Not a moment later.

1000
01:23:49,750 --> 01:23:53,083
And you will add $10,000 on top of that.
We'll call that interest.

1001
01:23:55,250 --> 01:23:56,166
Somethin' funny?

1002
01:23:56,250 --> 01:23:59,291
Ooh, shit, how...
how you reckon I'ma get that?

1003
01:23:59,875 --> 01:24:01,125
You're gonna rob a bank.

1004
01:24:03,791 --> 01:24:06,125
Nat Love is gonna rob a bank.

1005
01:24:08,375 --> 01:24:12,083
In the meantime, here's a little token
of my appreciation in advance.

1006
01:24:14,500 --> 01:24:16,083
Go ahead, open it.

1007
01:24:46,125 --> 01:24:48,125
I expect my money on Friday.

1008
01:24:49,291 --> 01:24:50,291
All of it.

1009
01:25:06,708 --> 01:25:08,416
You know I can't let you do that.

1010
01:25:11,541 --> 01:25:14,666
If that money ain't in Rufus' hands
in three days, Mary'll die.

1011
01:25:16,041 --> 01:25:17,791
What bank
we talking about anyway?

1012
01:25:17,875 --> 01:25:18,875
Maysville.

1013
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:22,000
Maysville?

1014
01:25:23,083 --> 01:25:24,000
That's a white town.

1015
01:25:24,083 --> 01:25:26,416
Yeah, which is why
they gonna have $10,000 in their bank.

1016
01:25:28,041 --> 01:25:29,041
It's crazy.

1017
01:25:29,125 --> 01:25:31,041
My emotions
are all types of confused.

1018
01:25:31,125 --> 01:25:33,291
I mean, Pickett, I agree. That's crazy.

1019
01:25:33,958 --> 01:25:35,958
But, Nat, I also agree with you
telling the marshal

1020
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:37,791
that we gonna do that shit anyways.

1021
01:25:38,333 --> 01:25:39,916
That's some true outlaw shit.

1022
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:42,083
- We outlaws, ain't we?
- Ain't no "we," Jim.

1023
01:25:43,041 --> 01:25:45,666
Not after that shit you pulled in town
nearly got us all killed.

1024
01:25:45,750 --> 01:25:46,583
I had that.

1025
01:25:46,666 --> 01:25:48,809
Fetch that money
you took from the Crimson Hoods.

1026
01:25:48,833 --> 01:25:50,250
Pickett, kid, you comin' with me.

1027
01:25:51,250 --> 01:25:53,875
If Rufus Buck want that bank took,
why don't he send his own men?

1028
01:25:53,958 --> 01:25:55,625
This way he clean, see?

1029
01:25:56,375 --> 01:25:58,291
I gotta go in barefaced as day,

1030
01:25:58,833 --> 01:26:02,791
a freshly minted bank robber, face up
on wanted posters all over the territory.

1031
01:26:02,875 --> 01:26:05,458
They'll be on you like flies on shit
before you open the door.

1032
01:26:05,541 --> 01:26:06,625
Yep.

1033
01:26:07,500 --> 01:26:09,833
I said <i>I</i> had to be recognized.

1034
01:26:12,958 --> 01:26:14,041
Go ahead.

1035
01:26:30,666 --> 01:26:31,958
Hell no.

1036
01:26:42,083 --> 01:26:43,083
For Mary.

1037
01:26:59,708 --> 01:27:02,375
Whoo! Hoo!

1038
01:27:02,458 --> 01:27:03,458
Close shave.

1039
01:27:03,875 --> 01:27:05,708
Close fucking shave!

1040
01:27:05,791 --> 01:27:07,958
I thought I was
falling for a fella for a little bit.

1041
01:27:08,041 --> 01:27:09,500
That's why I didn't say nothing.

1042
01:27:09,583 --> 01:27:11,916
Well, I ain't the only one. I can't...

1043
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:14,250
I can't... It wasn't just me.
It wasn't just me.

1044
01:27:14,833 --> 01:27:15,833
It was just you, Jim.

1045
01:27:31,583 --> 01:27:34,000
<i>♪ Follow, follow
People they go they follow ♪</i>

1046
01:27:34,083 --> 01:27:36,958
<i>♪ People they know they copy

1047
01:27:37,041 --> 01:27:40,000

1048

1049
01:27:42,958 --> 01:27:45,916

1050
01:28:05,833 --> 01:28:07,000
Giddup now.

1051
01:28:17,916 --> 01:28:19,166
Allow me.

1052
01:28:32,416 --> 01:28:33,583
What's your real name?

1053
01:28:34,500 --> 01:28:35,750
Cuffee my real name.

1054
01:28:37,166 --> 01:28:38,625
Name I was born with?

1055
01:28:38,708 --> 01:28:39,875
Cathay Williams.

1056
01:28:48,833 --> 01:28:51,166
You walk worse than you ride, Cathay.

1057
01:28:51,250 --> 01:28:53,750
Mr. Love, my momma always told me
to respect my elders,

1058
01:28:53,833 --> 01:28:55,583
so I'm not gonna say what I'm thinking.

1059
01:28:55,666 --> 01:28:57,583
That's all right. I can read your mind.

1060
01:28:57,666 --> 01:28:59,166
Then I'm sorry you had to hear that.

1061
01:29:13,250 --> 01:29:14,458
Go ahead.

1062
01:29:17,208 --> 01:29:18,333
Go ahead, honey.

1063
01:29:37,666 --> 01:29:38,750
Yes?

1064
01:29:40,791 --> 01:29:42,375
I'd like to make a withdrawal.

1065
01:29:50,416 --> 01:29:51,416
Ooh.

1066
01:29:56,541 --> 01:29:57,541
What...

1067
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:01,541
You have to have an account, ma'am.

1068
01:30:01,625 --> 01:30:07,208
And, well, I'd recommend a bank
in Jericho or maybe Redwood for that.

1069
01:30:07,291 --> 01:30:08,375
Oh.

1070
01:30:08,458 --> 01:30:10,666
I'm not talking about
that kinda withdrawal.

1071
01:30:11,458 --> 01:30:12,458
I'm talk...

1072
01:30:15,291 --> 01:30:16,291
I'm talking about...

1073
01:30:18,875 --> 01:30:21,333
talking about that kind.

1074
01:30:39,208 --> 01:30:40,375
Hey, blue eyes.

1075
01:30:42,500 --> 01:30:43,500
You scared.

1076
01:30:44,458 --> 01:30:45,818
Your hand is shaking. You'll miss.

1077
01:30:47,041 --> 01:30:48,041
I won't.

1078
01:30:53,666 --> 01:30:54,666
Exhale.

1079
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:10,000
Attaboy.

1080
01:31:11,666 --> 01:31:12,875
I ain't like my partner.

1081
01:31:12,958 --> 01:31:16,833
He don't wanna shoot nobody,
but all of a sudden, I'm of a mind to.

1082
01:31:16,916 --> 01:31:19,541
Now open the fuckin' gate.

1083
01:31:24,541 --> 01:31:25,541
Think I'm funny now?

1084
01:31:27,833 --> 01:31:29,208
What you lookin' at?

1085
01:31:29,291 --> 01:31:30,666
Get all the customers over there.

1086
01:31:30,750 --> 01:31:32,375
- Get 'em over there!
- Okay, okay.

1087
01:31:32,458 --> 01:31:35,083
- Everyone, please, this way quickly.
- You too. Move!

1088
01:31:39,666 --> 01:31:42,625
Times have changed, ain't they?

1089
01:31:51,375 --> 01:31:53,375
They say robbing banks is hard work.

1090
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:56,833
That's a lie. Robbing banks is easy.

1091
01:31:58,291 --> 01:32:01,333
The hard part is doing it without killing.

1092
01:32:03,416 --> 01:32:04,416
So, what'll it be...

1093
01:32:07,416 --> 01:32:08,416
Mr. Manager?

1094
01:32:16,125 --> 01:32:17,000
Good man.

1095
01:32:26,250 --> 01:32:27,625
Come on. Let's go.

1096
01:32:28,500 --> 01:32:29,791
Come on. Giddyap. Go.

1097
01:32:31,166 --> 01:32:32,375
Come on, come on.

1098
01:32:35,791 --> 01:32:37,958
- Pleasure banking with you.
- Okay, sir.

1099
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:41,000
Nat Love.

1100
01:33:10,750 --> 01:33:12,125
Don't even look like much.

1101
01:33:13,291 --> 01:33:16,000
Ain't what it look like.
It's what it can buy you.

1102
01:33:16,541 --> 01:33:19,416
Rufus won't let Mary go
once he gets that money.

1103
01:33:20,208 --> 01:33:21,416
Yeah, I know it.

1104
01:33:22,041 --> 01:33:25,791
He'll kill her,
let me go, so's I carry that hurt with me.

1105
01:33:26,833 --> 01:33:29,208
So what, we just went through
all that trouble for nothin'?

1106
01:33:30,250 --> 01:33:31,791
Now we got something he want.

1107
01:33:33,583 --> 01:33:34,583
And that's it?

1108
01:33:35,750 --> 01:33:36,958
Gonna have to be.

1109
01:33:40,166 --> 01:33:43,000
You can be all hasty
and shoot me now if you want,

1110
01:33:43,083 --> 01:33:46,208
or you can wait to see
what I brought with me first.

1111
01:33:49,875 --> 01:33:51,791
Ooh.

1112
01:33:51,875 --> 01:33:54,791
Rufus got stashes like this
all across these hills.

1113
01:33:55,416 --> 01:33:56,916
Enough for a small army.

1114
01:33:57,875 --> 01:34:00,000
Don't nobody take what I got coming to me.

1115
01:34:01,416 --> 01:34:03,083
Not even the Devil himself.

1116
01:34:03,166 --> 01:34:04,791
Rufus Buck is a man.

1117
01:34:04,875 --> 01:34:07,208
Y'all best reconcile yourselves
with that fact.

1118
01:34:07,291 --> 01:34:08,291
Man or devil,

1119
01:34:09,041 --> 01:34:11,208
this gonna be
Buck's last day amongst the living.

1132
01:36:19,583 --> 01:36:20,666
Afternoon.

1133
01:36:21,333 --> 01:36:24,166
I would ask you to run
go fetch your superior,

1134
01:36:24,250 --> 01:36:27,125
but that'd be like asking you
to run go fetch your daddy.

1135
01:36:28,250 --> 01:36:29,375
It could be anybody, right?

1136
01:36:29,458 --> 01:36:30,458
Hmm.

1137
01:36:30,875 --> 01:36:31,875
You know,

1138
01:36:33,166 --> 01:36:34,875
I'm willing to bet my right arm

1139
01:36:36,166 --> 01:36:38,125
I've got a higher body count than yours.

1140
01:36:39,666 --> 01:36:40,875
That'd be a bad bet, son.

1141
01:36:42,458 --> 01:36:46,833
I fancy that song or whatever it was
you was whistling there.

1142
01:36:47,666 --> 01:36:48,958
Go, Jerry. Go.

1143
01:36:54,500 --> 01:36:55,583
That our money?

1144
01:36:56,166 --> 01:36:57,500
Uh...

1145
01:36:59,375 --> 01:37:00,375
Walk with me.

1146
01:37:01,625 --> 01:37:03,208
Hey, just... just walk with me.

1147
01:37:03,708 --> 01:37:06,000
- Keep an eye on this, Angel.
- Mmm-hmm.

1148
01:37:27,291 --> 01:37:30,500
You know they call your boss
the Devil hisself?

1149
01:37:32,875 --> 01:37:34,750
Even the Devil needed money, right?

1150
01:37:36,458 --> 01:37:40,625
So being as how we are
in possession of that money...

1151
01:37:43,208 --> 01:37:46,166
let me dictate the terms of engagement.

1152
01:37:59,333 --> 01:38:02,333
What the fuck was that?
What the fuck was that, old man?

1153
01:38:03,916 --> 01:38:05,276
Is that the right arm or the left?

1154
01:38:08,041 --> 01:38:09,041
Oh man.

1155
01:38:10,125 --> 01:38:12,208
Well, now there's us...

1156
01:38:14,291 --> 01:38:15,291
and there's y'all.

1157
01:40:22,083 --> 01:40:23,416
Whoa.

1158
01:40:28,541 --> 01:40:29,833
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1159
01:40:31,250 --> 01:40:33,291
You get a hold of your feisty buddy here.

1160
01:40:34,083 --> 01:40:35,283
You got a little rowdy rascal.

1161
01:40:36,500 --> 01:40:38,434
- Mary.
- Yeah, we'll get to that.

1162
01:40:38,458 --> 01:40:40,833
- We gonna count this first.
- Now, Cherokee.

1163
01:40:41,833 --> 01:40:45,333
Or your boss gonna be
one quick draw and $35,000 short.

1164
01:41:13,333 --> 01:41:14,333
All right.

1165
01:41:16,291 --> 01:41:18,041
Unhitch this horse so's Mary can ride out.

1166
01:41:29,583 --> 01:41:32,303
- You always move so slow?
- You always talk so much?

1167
01:41:45,666 --> 01:41:46,666
Really?

1168
01:41:48,500 --> 01:41:49,625
In the back?

1169
01:41:53,416 --> 01:41:54,875
What you think, Beckwourth?

1170
01:41:56,458 --> 01:41:58,000
Nah, he wouldn't do that

1171
01:41:58,583 --> 01:42:01,333
'cause then I would have to put
a bullet in his cranium.

1172
01:42:01,416 --> 01:42:04,250
And we'll never know
who the fastest really is now, will we?

1173
01:42:09,333 --> 01:42:11,166
I gotta hand it to you, boy.

1174
01:42:11,250 --> 01:42:13,833
You do know how to make a grand entrance.

1175
01:42:14,958 --> 01:42:16,958
Shit, I didn't even rehearse that one.

1176
01:42:19,541 --> 01:42:21,083
You know, quick draw,

1177
01:42:22,083 --> 01:42:23,708
Nat Love is a dead man walking.

1178
01:42:25,750 --> 01:42:27,000
But you don't have to be.

1179
01:42:27,500 --> 01:42:29,500
Why don't you get on your horse,
get your shit,

1180
01:42:29,583 --> 01:42:31,583
and go back to
whatever it is you call home?

1181
01:42:33,333 --> 01:42:34,833
You know that's impossible.

1182
01:42:43,750 --> 01:42:45,125
Count down from five?

1183
01:42:55,791 --> 01:42:56,791
Five...

1184
01:43:14,458 --> 01:43:15,458
Four...

1185
01:43:29,458 --> 01:43:30,291
Three...

1186
01:43:37,916 --> 01:43:41,083
Why do they always have to count so slow?

1187
01:43:41,166 --> 01:43:43,458

01:59:03,458 --> 01:59:05,208
if she overcooked his food.

1274
01:59:06,083 --> 01:59:08,708
He cut her up real good
if she undercooked it too.

1275
01:59:13,041 --> 01:59:15,708
One day, I decided to intervene,

1276
01:59:17,458 --> 01:59:19,166
and he turned his wrath on me.

1277
01:59:23,541 --> 01:59:25,916
My father was not a good man.

1278
01:59:28,083 --> 01:59:29,958
Not a good man. He was an outlaw.

1279
01:59:31,750 --> 01:59:33,041
Robbin' banks...

1280
01:59:35,583 --> 01:59:36,750
He liked to drink.

1281
01:59:43,416 --> 01:59:46,583
My mother took a bottle
and cut him to protect me.

1282
01:59:49,625 --> 01:59:53,041
He lashed back at her,
and just like that, she was gone.

1283
01:59:56,333 --> 01:59:59,625
Then, like the coward he is,

1284
02:00:01,000 --> 02:00:03,208
he took everything we had and left,

1285
02:00:05,250 --> 02:00:06,791
leaving me with my...

1286
02:00:08,875 --> 02:00:09,875
my mother.

1287
02:00:15,750 --> 02:00:17,583
I was ten years old, you know...

1288
02:00:19,916 --> 02:00:21,833
about the same age you was...

1289
02:00:25,041 --> 02:00:26,500
when I gave you that scar.

1290
02:00:29,666 --> 02:00:33,041
I had to fend for myself,
but I became who I am,

1291
02:00:34,333 --> 02:00:35,375
just like you.

1292
02:00:41,166 --> 02:00:46,375
As I did, all I could ever think about is
wanting my father to pay for what he did.

1293
02:00:48,583 --> 02:00:52,833
I searched for him for years and years,
and I could never find him.

1294
02:00:55,625 --> 02:00:58,125
It's like he disappeared
off the face of the earth.

1295
02:01:00,166 --> 02:01:03,416
I ain't stop though. I kept looking...

1296
02:01:07,208 --> 02:01:08,916
until I did find him.

1297
02:01:13,500 --> 02:01:14,541
One day...

1298
02:01:19,666 --> 02:01:21,000
lo and behold,

1299
02:01:22,916 --> 02:01:24,333
there he was,

1300
02:01:25,125 --> 02:01:26,125
my father,

1301
02:01:27,375 --> 02:01:28,458
a new man.

1302
02:01:29,833 --> 02:01:31,291
He was clean now.

1303
02:01:33,333 --> 02:01:34,333
Sober.

1304
02:01:37,291 --> 02:01:38,375
Man of God.

1305
02:01:43,375 --> 02:01:44,625
Had a church.

1306
02:01:45,916 --> 02:01:47,750
He had a pretty little wife.

1307
02:01:51,708 --> 02:01:53,125
And he had a son,

1308
02:01:55,166 --> 02:01:57,208
about the age of ten years old,

1309
02:01:59,083 --> 02:02:01,125
whose eyes blazed like mine.

1310
02:02:02,583 --> 02:02:03,583
You're lyin'.

1311
02:02:04,500 --> 02:02:05,916
You're lyin'!

1312
02:02:11,500 --> 02:02:13,541
Killing our father was retribution, but...

1313
02:02:13,625 --> 02:02:14,791
<i>My</i> father!

1314
02:02:16,875 --> 02:02:17,875
<i>My</i> mother!

1315
02:02:20,583 --> 02:02:21,791
But it weren't enough.

1316
02:02:23,625 --> 02:02:24,750
Letting you live,

1317
02:02:25,583 --> 02:02:27,291
that was the true revenge.

1318
02:02:29,833 --> 02:02:34,250
Every sin you made, every bank you robbed,
everybody you killed.

1319
02:02:35,291 --> 02:02:36,625
I mean, look at you.

1320
02:02:37,833 --> 02:02:40,208
You everything he tried to run away from.

1321
02:02:42,333 --> 02:02:43,333
Buck.

1322
02:02:47,083 --> 02:02:48,583
Changed his name to "Love."

1323
02:02:53,750 --> 02:02:54,750
You a Buck.

1324
02:02:55,625 --> 02:02:56,625
You lyin'.

1325
02:02:57,500 --> 02:02:58,583
Just like me.

1326
02:03:00,041 --> 02:03:01,208
Just like him.

1327
02:03:03,208 --> 02:03:06,666
But you better.
You gonna surpass even me because...

1328
02:03:09,083 --> 02:03:10,458
I couldn't kill my brother.

1329
02:03:12,166 --> 02:03:14,541
Yet here you are about to kill yours.

1330
02:03:15,958 --> 02:03:19,083
It's time to take your revenge,
Nathaniel Buck.

1331
02:03:24,125 --> 02:03:25,166
Go on.

1332
02:03:29,958 --> 02:03:31,416
- Nathaniel Buck.
- No.

1333
02:03:35,958 --> 02:03:37,166
Take your revenge.

1334
02:03:40,208 --> 02:03:41,416
Nathaniel Buck.

1335
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:43,958
Take your goddamn revenge!

1336
02:03:46,500 --> 02:03:47,791
You a Buck.

1337
02:03:50,333 --> 02:03:52,125

是一个人！ 我们把他钉住了！

1619
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:54,166
等他的头露出来，然后吹掉那个混蛋。

1620
00:11:54,791 --> 00:11:55,958
要有耐心。

1621
00:11:56,041 --> 00:11:57,916
我听说耐心是一种美德。

1622
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,083
但我一直迫不及待地想看看这混蛋是不是真的。

1623
00:12:03,166 --> 00:12:05,708
- 吉姆·贝克沃斯。
- 格莱姆兄弟。

1624
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:08,458
这是带有“S”的格莱姆斯，你这个自负的狗屎。

1625
00:12:08,541 --> 00:12:11,208
我记得有一段时间你们所有的头巾都是深红色的。

1626
00:12:11,291 --> 00:12:13,791
被称为深红兜帽帮。

1627
00:12:14,916 --> 00:12:16,416
他们混蛋现在是粉红色的。

1628
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:20,791
你知道，妈妈常说，“吉姆真是个好孩子。” 你知道我说了什么吗？

1629
00:12:20,875 --> 00:12:22,958
“妈妈，他妈的吉姆！看看他对我他妈的眼睛做了什么！”

1630
00:12:23,666 --> 00:12:25,208
- 我<i>很</i>甜。
- 你不甜。

1631
00:12:25,291 --> 00:12:26,708
- 我很甜。
- 你不甜。

1632
00:12:26,791 --> 00:12:28,125
- 我很甜。
- 你不是。

1633
00:12:28,208 --> 00:12:30,333
- 婊子，我很甜。
- 你知道吗？

1634
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:32,767
我宁愿死也不愿听这个混蛋继续说话。

1635
00:12:34,875 --> 00:12:35,875
哇。

1636
00:12:36,666 --> 00:12:38,333
非常感谢，混蛋。

1637
00:12:38,833 --> 00:12:40,291
这他妈是什么鬼

1638
00:12:40,375 --> 00:12:42,916
当我的屁股被击中时玩速成游戏？

1639
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,458
嘿嘿嘿。 你拿到了你的幸运币，不是吗？

1640
00:12:45,541 --> 00:12:48,375
长大了，吉姆。 这是真正的大人狗屎。 我们可以死。

1641
00:12:48,458 --> 00:12:50,000
但我们不会死。

1642
00:12:50,791 --> 00:12:53,041
因为我很容易被责备。 承认吧。

1643
00:12:54,708 --> 00:12:58,125
你知道，你可能会，但我听说有一个快速抽奖

1644
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,625
比你更闪电，以切诺基比尔的名义。

1645
00:13:04,666 --> 00:13:05,875
“切诺基比尔。”

1646
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:07,541
你道听途说。

1647
00:13:08,166 --> 00:13:09,208
你不说。

1648
00:13:09,875 --> 00:13:12,708
所以我说他妈的切诺基比尔。

1649
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:16,583
你知道，与其抱怨，不如为我的表现鼓掌。

1650
00:13:16,666 --> 00:13:19,541
唯一应该从你的黑屁股嘴里说出来的话......

1651
00:13:19,625 --> 00:13:21,208
- “黑屁股嘴唇”？  -...应该...

1652
00:13:24,333 --> 00:13:25,933
- <i>...gracias.</i>
- 那很顺利。

1653
00:13:25,958 --> 00:13:27,708
- 我知道。
- 黑色的嘴唇是美丽的嘴唇。

1654
00:13:27,791 --> 00:13:30,333
- 你会停止接触吗，黑人？
- 该死的。

1655
00:13:31,625 --> 00:13:33,041
你刚刚杀了我的兄弟。

1656
00:13:33,125 --> 00:13:36,625
你的同父异母兄弟，冷静点。 看起来你的日子有点糟糕。

1657
00:13:37,208 --> 00:13:38,448
当你发现你搞砸了谁的钱时，比你们这些狗娘养的要好。

1658
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:40,500


1659
00:13:41,583 --> 00:13:44,458
更正。  <i>你</i>干了谁。

1660
00:13:44,541 --> 00:13:47,083
你们都抢银行。 我们抢劫你们。

1661
00:13:47,166 --> 00:13:50,500
从这里到非洲的黑人不会知道我们的存在。

1662
00:13:51,541 --> 00:13:53,458

晚上，绅士。 请检查您的武器并享受庆祝活动。

1679
00:15:13,333 --> 00:15:15,601
这是驿马车玛丽的地方，是不是不允许持枪？

1680
00:15:15,625 --> 00:15:17,291
'Cept for Mary's，自然。

1681
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:19,083
自然。

1682
00:15:20,166 --> 00:15:22,916
自然而然地，她把一只像你这样的新面孔放在了这里来照顾它。

1683
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,791
哦，我得看很多东西，爱先生。

1684
00:15:25,875 --> 00:15:28,958
人们看到我，并不会因为他们看到的东西而感到害怕。 看？

1685
00:15:29,958 --> 00:15:30,875
我们熟悉吗？

1686
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:34,250
不，但你在这些地方很有名。

1687
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:36,453
人们说你曾经用一颗子弹杀死了三个人。

1688
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:40,625
现在，我还没有遇到一个能做到这一点的人。 打扰一下。

1689
00:15:40,708 --> 00:15:43,833
晚上，先生们。 请检查您的武器并享受您的夜晚。

1690
00:15:43,916 --> 00:15:45,791
我会尽快检查我的右臂，男孩。

1691
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:48,666
然后您可以前往 Jourdon Anderson's。

1692
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:50,875
你可以拿着武器在那边喝酒。

1693
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:52,875
我们在这里喝酒，你这个小屁孩。

1694
00:15:55,125 --> 00:15:56,333
嘿！

1695
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:00,666
无论如何，有些人倾向于有一种感觉。

1696
00:16:01,541 --> 00:16:03,541
把他们带到布朗医生那里。

1697
00:16:03,625 --> 00:16:05,059
把他们的枪带到警长那里。

1698
00:16:05,083 --> 00:16:06,958
当他们离开城镇时，他们可以把它们拿回来。

1699
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
他们叫你什么？

1700
00:16:11,791 --> 00:16:13,208
他们叫我库菲。

1701

你还不跟我说话？

1726
00:18:26,291 --> 00:18:27,458
出去。

00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:30,708
什么？

1728

00:19:57,375 --> 00:19:58,833
直到下一次你听到有人告诉你某个让你肮脏的人的下落。

1740
00:19:58,916 --> 00:20:01,041


1741
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:04,916
他们一个都没有离开。

1742
00:20:06,125 --> 00:20:07,833
所以你找到蝎子了吗？

1743
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:14,291
玛丽，现在这个世界上唯一对我有意义的东西

1744
00:20:15,875 --> 00:20:17,000
是你。

1745
00:20:22,833 --> 00:20:24,541
那纳特爱帮呢？

1746
00:20:26,083 --> 00:20:28,166
自从你离开后就不是什么帮派了。

1747
00:20:29,125 --> 00:20:31,500
只有我，吉姆，比尔。

1748
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:34,875
下次他们来的时候，我会整理一下。

1749
00:20:36,333 --> 00:20:37,375
嗯。

1750
00:20:38,583 --> 00:20:40,458
你知道，我几乎可以相信这一点。

1751
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:47,041
几乎，因为你没有得到最后一个，是吗？

1752
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:51,875
你可以说出他的名字，玛丽。

1753
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:54,375
鲁弗斯·巴克呢？

1754
00:20:54,458 --> 00:20:57,833
鲁弗斯在尤马度过了他的余生。

1755
00:20:57,916 --> 00:20:59,708
对于他这样的人来说，这比死还要糟糕。

1756
00:21:01,958 --> 00:21:04,333
只要那个人吸一口气，你的灵魂就会像以前一样被诅咒和狂野。

1757
00:21:04,416 --> 00:21:07,208


1758
00:21:07,291 --> 00:21:08,291
唔。

1759
00:21:08,625 --> 00:21:09,833
我做了东西，

1760
00:21:11,166 --> 00:21:13,916
我建造了东西，我不会因为你决定回来而冒险。

1761
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,500


1762
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:18,583
- “Trottin'”？
- 是的。

1763
00:21:19,666 --> 00:21:22,250
- 好吧，好吧。  - 嗯嗯。

1764
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:24,625
我想我来错沙龙了

1765
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:27,666
因为我没有和我自以为认识的玛丽·菲尔兹说话。

1766
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:29,541
- 是的。 事情变了。
- 我看到。

1767
00:21:29,625 --> 00:21:30,625
嗯嗯。

1768
00:21:31,041 --> 00:21:32,333
因为玛丽...

1769
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:42,166
那个玛丽...

1770
00:21:44,791 --> 00:21:46,541
...不要回避什么。

1771
00:21:53,375 --> 00:21:55,125
Apache 叫你什么？

1772
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,333
狼娘？

1773
00:21:57,416 --> 00:22:00,166
不，这是皮克特过去常说的胡说八道。

1774
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:02,083
这是皮克特过去常说的胡说八道。

1775
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,875
- 阿帕奇叫我土狼女人。
- 唔。

1776
00:22:09,083 --> 00:22:13,500
是的，狼娘更喜欢。

1777
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
我的帽子。

1778
00:22:35,416 --> 00:22:36,416
那里。

1779
00:22:50,166 --> 00:22:51,666
我进来了。

1780
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:54,125
现在，狼夫人，不要把我的头从我脖子上吹下来。

1781
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:57,500
- 纳特。
- 皮克特。

1782
00:22:58,416 --> 00:23:00,376
你得到了计时史上最糟糕的计时。

1783
00:23:01,208 --> 00:23:02,583
哦，你们都在做爱？

1784
00:23:03,083 --> 00:23:04,125
我道歉。

1785
00:23:04,875 --> 00:23:07,125
但我要向你展示的东西等不及了。

1786
00:23:10,458 --> 00:23:11,875
好吧，好吧，好吧。

1787
00:23:12,833 --> 00:23:14,916
如果这不是温文尔雅的蠢货自己。

1788
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,291
哇，轻松，纳特。 先听听男人怎么说。

1789
00:23:17,375 --> 00:23:19,434
所以他可以告诉我他告诉你的同样的故事吗？

1790
00:23:19,458 --> 00:23:21,000
我他妈的为什么要撒谎？

1791
00:23:22,166 --> 00:23:27,083
鲁弗斯·巴克在他的余生中都被关在监狱里。

1792
00:23:28,708 --> 00:23:30,916
- 他要出去了。
- 如何？

1793
00:23:32,375 --> 00:23:33,583
如果我知道就该死。

1794
00:23:34,083 --> 00:23:35,416
我只知道是这样。

1795
00:23:36,458 --> 00:23:39,041
所有的帮派都准备再次为他骑行。

1796
00:23:40,041 --> 00:23:42,500
一半是他的。

1797
00:23:43,208 --> 00:23:47,958
而你们这些傻瓜拿了<i>他的</i>钱。

1798
00:23:50,125 --> 00:23:53,666
你认为鲁弗斯·巴克会让你保留那一半的钱，

1799
00:23:54,625 --> 00:23:56,333
你说我是个傻瓜？

1800
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,708
我想我是。

1801
00:24:01,916 --> 00:24:02,916
在你的脚上。

1802
00:24:15,083 --> 00:24:16,083
呼气。

1803
00:24:36,916 --> 00:24:37,958
现在离开这里。

1804
00:24:39,666 --> 00:24:40,666
离开。

1805
00:24:41,875 --> 00:24:44,666
你在做什么'？ 我们可以杀死最后一个深红头巾。

1806
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:48,208
它被称为深红色兜帽帮。 你以为这是最后一个？

1807
00:24:57,083 --> 00:24:58,083
是的。

1808
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:04,416
我敢打赌我的左六射手他会杀死那个男孩。

1809
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:08,125
如果那个人说的是实话，纳特只会让他更糟。

1810
00:25:18,333 --> 00:25:21,291
<i>♪ 哇，看到了！ 我来了！  ♪</i>

1811
00:25:30,250 --> 00:25:32,916
<i>♪ 哇，看到了！ 我来了！  ♪</i>

1812
00:25:42,041 --> 00:25:45,041

1813
00:25:46,791 --> 00:25:48,416
<i>♪ 我来了！  ♪</i>

1814
00:26:52,708 --> 00:26:54,541
你到底在外面干什么？

1815
00:26:54,625 --> 00:26:57,500
那不是没有办法登上火车，你该死的笨蛋...

1816
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:05,458
你知道，他可能会说 nincompoop。

1817
00:27:06,125 --> 00:27:07,791
我们不是傻瓜。

1818
00:27:09,541 --> 00:27:12,166
如果他们说的话甚至以“N”开头，

1819
00:27:12,250 --> 00:27:14,083
他们会遇到同样的命运。

1820
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:17,166
让他们看看你的脸。

1821
00:27:21,583 --> 00:27:24,375
好吧，大家保持冷静。 不要......嘿，不要碰任何东西。

1822
00:27:25,333 --> 00:27:26,833
我叫切诺基比尔。

1823
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:31,041
现在让大家知道，我并不特别喜欢暴力。

1824
00:27:31,666 --> 00:27:32,708
话虽如此，您目前与极端暴力的人在一起。

1825
00:27:32,791 --> 00:27:36,166


1826
00:27:36,833 --> 00:27:37,833
尝试一些。

1827
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:41,166
啊。 拉屎。

1828
00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:45,416
所以，不要做蠢事。 好的？

1829
00:27:46,291 --> 00:27:49,291
快下车吧，你这个没有妈妈的人渣。

1830
00:27:51,041 --> 00:27:52,500
你一定是英雄。

1831
00:27:54,208 --> 00:27:56,958
大神，为什么总有一个？

1832
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
你粗鲁。

1833
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:02,875
我可能真的很喜欢对你施加暴力。

1834
00:28:02,958 --> 00:28:04,166
但谁知道呢？

1835
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:05,750
也许你会赢。

1836
00:28:08,041 --> 00:28:08,875
让我们来看看。

1837
00:28:15,333 --> 00:28:16,416
明白我的意思了吗？

1838
00:28:17,125 --> 00:28:21,750
现在，让开，这样我们就可以毫不费力地在这里结束我们的工作。

1839
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:29,958
好吧，大家...

1840
00:28:37,291 --> 00:28:38,416
停在那儿。

1841
00:28:40,291 --> 00:28:41,333
不。

1842
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:44,916
我说停。

1843
00:28:47,166 --> 00:28:48,750
放下武器，男孩。

1844
00:28:50,458 --> 00:28:52,583
或者我们杀死这列火车上的每个人。

1845
00:28:57,666 --> 00:29:00,041
我说把枪放下。

1846
00:29:05,208 --> 00:29:06,208
没关系。

1847
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:13,791
那辆车上还有士兵吗？

1848
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
有。

1849
00:29:17,458 --> 00:29:18,583
究竟是多少？

1850
00:29:19,791 --> 00:29:20,791
三十。

1851
00:29:21,916 --> 00:29:23,208
十！

1852
00:29:25,166 --> 00:29:26,958
看，这就是你要说的。

1853
00:29:28,208 --> 00:29:29,291
打开门。

1854
00:29:30,666 --> 00:29:32,125
我说打开该死的门。

1855
00:29:45,833 --> 00:29:47,041
我们到了。

1856
00:29:49,791 --> 00:29:50,833
我亲爱的营。

1857
00:29:53,833 --> 00:29:57,750
我想你把所有的大炮都对准了门。

1858
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,375
我想告诉你，在那扇门前，有一个你自己的部队。

1859
00:30:01,458 --> 00:30:03,666


1860
00:30:03,750 --> 00:30:07,416
任何穿过那扇门的子弹都会先击中他，好吗？

1861
00:30:08,041 --> 00:30:09,375
说出你的名字，罪犯。

1862
00:30:09,458 --> 00:30:13,250
哦，我不是罪犯，先生，嗯，但我的名字是切诺基比尔。

1863
00:30:13,333 --> 00:30:14,458
你叫什么名字？

1864
00:30:14,541 --> 00:30:16,875
我的名字是该死的法律的执行官。

1865
00:30:17,666 --> 00:30:19,500
你让那个士兵立即离开。

1866
00:30:20,083 --> 00:30:21,875
现在离开这列火车，没有人会受伤。

1867
00:30:21,958 --> 00:30:26,083
哦，这听起来像是在谈论恐惧，该死的法律主持先生。

1868
00:30:26,166 --> 00:30:27,916
我们已经伤害了几个人。

1869
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,833
你只是想让我们逍遥法外吗？

1870
00:30:30,916 --> 00:30:32,833
说出你的目的，混蛋。

1871
00:30:32,916 --> 00:30:34,750
还有，我不是混蛋。

1872
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:37,666
但是你已经得到了我们想要的东西。 我们有你想要的士兵。

1873
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:43,083
现在，我建议我们进行和平交易，每个人都可以活着看到新的一天。

1874
00:30:43,166 --> 00:30:45,791
- 听起来很花哨？
- 让男孩走吧。

1875
00:30:45,875 --> 00:30:46,750
杰克！

1876
00:30:51,791 --> 00:30:53,083
我没事，爸爸！

1877
00:30:53,916 --> 00:30:55,333
那只是皮肉伤，先生。

1878
00:30:56,416 --> 00:31:00,125
你有十秒钟的时间放下你的枪，打开这扇该死的门，否则你这里的小亲戚就会灭亡。

1879
00:31:00,208 --> 00:31:01,916


1880
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:06,125
进一步伤害他，我会杀死你们最后一个不敬虔的狗娘养的。

1881
00:31:07,541 --> 00:31:10,083
该死的，特鲁迪。 你知道我喜欢我的倒计时。

1882
00:31:11,250 --> 00:31:15,000
我很抱歉，先生。 我这里的朋友不喜欢算术。

1883
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:17,958
不管怎样，七秒。

1884
00:31:21,583 --> 00:31:22,583
六。

1885
00:31:22,625 --> 00:31:25,458
- 放下你的步枪。
- 五。

1886
00:31:27,083 --> 00:31:28,625
我说把它们放下。

1887
00:31:28,708 --> 00:31:29,708
四。

1888
00:31:31,958 --> 00:31:32,958
三。

1889
00:31:42,791 --> 00:31:46,333
好吧，好吧。 非常感谢你。 走吧，男孩。

1890
00:31:48,916 --> 00:31:52,041
继续走。 继续前进。 没有人做任何愚蠢的事情。

1891
00:31:52,125 --> 00:31:53,500
就像你被教导的那样走路。

1892
00:31:53,583 --> 00:31:58,041
左，右，左。 左，右，左。

1893
00:31:58,125 --> 00:32:00,083
左，右，左。

1894
00:32:00,166 --> 00:32:02,750
<i>♪ 跳到 Lou，亲爱的 ♪</i>

1895
00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:35,750
- 打开它。
- 我不能。

1896
00:32:36,333 --> 00:32:38,708
钥匙回到尤马。 而接下来...

1897
00:32:44,916 --> 00:32:46,166
再一次。

1898
00:32:46,875 --> 00:32:49,958
你会因此被追到天涯海角。

1899
00:32:50,041 --> 00:32:54,375
我不喜欢长途跋涉，艾伯特中将。

1900
00:32:56,958 --> 00:32:59,666
有没有想过为什么你被赋予将一个孤独的歹徒从一个监狱运送到另一个监狱的任务？

1901
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:03,750


1902
00:33:06,458 --> 00:33:12,208
完全赦免巴克先生和他的所有同伙犯下的所有罪行。

1903
00:33:12,291 --> 00:33:15,500
署名乔治·普赖斯将军。

1904
00:33:17,958 --> 00:33:18,958
这是关于什么的？

1905
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:23,708
好吧，他带着一个提议来找我们。

1906
00:33:24,708 --> 00:33:28,333
杀死该死的法律的特定官员。

1907
00:33:29,583 --> 00:33:34,291
一个如此狡猾的人，连政府都为他的罪行感到尴尬。

1908
00:33:34,791 --> 00:33:39,166
显然，你和你的男人消灭了整个城镇，包括妇女和儿童，

1909
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:40,833


1910
00:33:41,333 --> 00:33:42,791
偷银子。

1911
00:33:43,583 --> 00:33:46,083
- 现在，这是一些不道德的狗屎。
- 不道德的狗屎。

1912
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:46,333
请。 我会分...

1913
00:35:46,416 --> 00:35:47,416
嘘。

1914
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,333
不！

1915
00:35:53,833 --> 00:35:57,833
啪！ 不，不，不，不，不。

1916
00:35:58,541 --> 00:35:59,541
帕。

1917
00:35:59,958 --> 00:36:00,958
不。

1918
00:36:02,958 --> 00:36:04,750
这里谁能开火车？

1919
00:36:11,708 --> 00:36:12,708
我说...

1920
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,458
除了他之外的所有人。

1921
00:36:29,041 --> 00:36:32,208
<i>♪ 哇，看到了！ 我来了！  ♪</i>

1922

1925
00:37:27,083 --> 00:37:30,791
晚上，先生。 和我一起检查你的武器，享受夜晚剩下的一切。

1926
00:37:32,625 --> 00:37:35,750
哦，没必要给我看那颗星。 我知道你是谁。

1927
00:37:36,666 --> 00:37:40,958
不过，在这里，我是警长，这让玛丽女士成为元帅。

1928
00:37:41,041 --> 00:37:43,666
元帅说：“不要让任何人进来这里被枪杀，否则他们可能会被枪杀。”

1929
00:37:43,750 --> 00:37:45,458


1930
00:37:46,375 --> 00:37:49,000
我的徽章不同意。

1931
00:37:57,791 --> 00:37:59,208
检查你的枪带。

1932
00:38:02,333 --> 00:38:03,333
打扰一下。

1933
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:16,375
那么你打算如何收留我，元帅？

1934
00:38:18,041 --> 00:38:19,041
死盯着我看？

1935
00:38:19,708 --> 00:38:21,208
只是死亡又如何？

1936
00:38:27,875 --> 00:38:28,875
只是一根管子。

1937
00:38:33,750 --> 00:38:34,750
你介意？

1938
00:38:36,541 --> 00:38:38,000
从来不知道你去碰它。

1939
00:38:40,333 --> 00:38:41,708
只有在我杀了一个人之后。

1940
00:38:43,916 --> 00:38:45,000
或者之前。

1941
00:38:46,250 --> 00:38:48,208
由于堪萨斯城的一起银行抢劫案，我正在追查

1942
00:38:48,291 --> 00:38:50,958
Crimson Hood Gang。

1943
00:38:51,041 --> 00:38:53,791
原来有人在我之前得到了他们。

1944
00:38:54,375 --> 00:38:56,000
你知道我不抢劫银行，元帅。

1945
00:38:56,083 --> 00:38:59,000
但是你抢劫他们这样做，这对我来说都是一样的。

1946
00:38:59,083 --> 00:39:00,625
- 德克萨斯州。
- 什么？

1947
00:39:00,708 --> 00:39:02,750
抢劫发生时我在德克萨斯州。

1948
00:39:02,833 --> 00:39:04,125
你怎么知道什么时候发生的？

1949
00:39:04,208 --> 00:39:07,291
每当发生银行抢劫案时，我都在德克萨斯州。

1950
00:39:08,958 --> 00:39:11,208
当然，除非抢劫发生在德克萨斯州。

1951
00:39:13,666 --> 00:39:16,875
我听到的方式，其中一些是带着深红色兜帽的男孩

1952
00:39:17,708 --> 00:39:21,208
是新的 Rufus Buck 帮的一部分，Nat。

1953
00:39:21,291 --> 00:39:22,208
尤马的鲁弗斯。

1954
00:39:22,291 --> 00:39:24,833
他出来。 但你已经知道了，不是吗？

1955
00:39:24,916 --> 00:39:27,156
当你应该出去围捕你的小副手时，你为什么坐在这里独白，喝我的威士忌？

1956
00:39:27,208 --> 00:39:29,541


1957
00:39:30,291 --> 00:39:31,875
因为他被赦免了，纳特。

1958
00:39:35,375 --> 00:39:39,000
鲁弗斯·巴克被赦免了他无数的掠夺行为。

1959
00:39:40,291 --> 00:39:44,833
看到我一直在寻找银行劫匪之类的地形，

1960
00:39:46,541 --> 00:39:50,250
那条特别的消息没能传到我这里。

1961
00:39:52,208 --> 00:39:53,375
他们在说什么？

1962
00:39:54,916 --> 00:39:56,833
关于枪的东西，杀人。

1963
00:39:56,916 --> 00:40:00,791
你为什么让那个孩子拿走我的枪？ 这是什么愚蠢的规则？

1964
00:40:00,875 --> 00:40:03,333
- 应该是四支枪指向...
- 闭嘴，皮克特。

1965
00:40:08,833 --> 00:40:11,000
你开枪，他死了。

1966
00:40:12,291 --> 00:40:13,500
你想念，

1967
00:40:14,333 --> 00:40:15,416
你们都死了。

1968
00:40:18,583 --> 00:40:19,791
你过来。

1969
00:40:19,875 --> 00:40:22,583
拿着这些袖口。 铐住这个人。

1970
00:40:22,666 --> 00:40:25,875
或者我现在把三个放在他的胸口，减少麻烦。

1971
00:40:31,250 --> 00:40:32,250
继续。

1972
00:40:35,916 --> 00:40:37,250
告诉这个年轻的雄鹿备份。

1973
00:40:37,750 --> 00:40:38,875
容易，吉姆。

1974
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,708
这里的每个人都知道我是谁。

1975
00:40:43,708 --> 00:40:46,541
我要带 Nat Love 去 Fort Smith 接受审判。

1976
00:40:47,458 --> 00:40:49,083
任何人都试图跟随我，

1977
00:40:50,083 --> 00:40:51,458
你们都知道我在做什么。

1978
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:54,500
来吧。

1979
00:41:00,666 --> 00:41:02,250
你们都享受晚上剩下的时间。

鲁弗斯。

1998
00:42:20,958 --> 00:42:24,916
切诺基比尔，史密斯女士，早上好。

1999
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:28,583
巴克先生，很高兴您回到雷德伍德，先生。

2000
00:42:33,791 --> 00:42:36,125
关于堪萨斯城银行的任何消息？

2001
00:42:36,708 --> 00:42:39,250
Crimson Hoods 以 25,000 美元的价格购买了它。

2002
00:42:39,916 --> 00:42:41,666
可他们还没来得及，就遭到了伏击。

2003
00:42:45,708 --> 00:42:48,791
每个人都知道从我们这里带走是自杀。

2004
00:42:48,875 --> 00:42:50,833
显然有人不同意。

2005
00:42:50,916 --> 00:42:53,583
他妈的。 那只是让我们回到了开始的地方。

2006
00:42:53,666 --> 00:42:56,833
我们应该如何在没有任何砖块的情况下建造麦加？

2007
00:42:56,916 --> 00:42:59,083
我们得把它从我们自己的银行里拿出来。

2008
00:42:59,583 --> 00:43:01,583
我们没有那种钱，特鲁迪。

2009
00:43:02,083 --> 00:43:04,625
我们只拿到了超过 2,500 美元的几便士。

2010
00:43:04,708 --> 00:43:05,750
他说什么？

2011
00:43:06,916 --> 00:43:08,541
- 2,500...
- 我听到了。

2012
00:43:13,041 --> 00:43:14,958
- 威利。
- 是的。

2013
00:43:20,666 --> 00:43:22,166
当然很热，不是吗？

2014
00:44:04,458 --> 00:44:05,583
怎么了，小家伙？

2015
00:44:06,250 --> 00:44:07,875
- 你想看什么吗？
- 是的。

2016
00:44:08,458 --> 00:44:10,666
现在看这个。 不要把你的眼睛从它身上移开。

2017
00:44:14,708 --> 00:44:16,708
哦，它还在！

2018
00:45:00,208 --> 00:45:01,583
鲁弗斯·巴克。

2019
00:45:03,041 --> 00:45:04,208
看着你。

2020
00:45:05,416 --> 00:45:09,125
昔日的遗物，什么也没有。

2021
00:45:11,208 --> 00:45:14,541
你以为你可以滚进我的城镇，拿走属于我的东西？

2022
00:45:15,958 --> 00:45:18,083
你他妈的以为我是谁，嗯？

2023
00:45:19,583 --> 00:45:22,166
是不是没有人害怕你，是不是没有人跑'。

2024
00:45:23,166 --> 00:45:25,083
我也是个阴险的混蛋。

2025
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:29,958
我的手指轻轻一按，你就消失了。

2026
00:45:32,250 --> 00:45:34,000
所以我建议你离开...

2027
00:45:36,125 --> 00:45:37,625
在我吃完牛排之前。

2028
00:45:40,875 --> 00:45:43,315
如果你甚至考虑坚持......

2029
00:45:45,833 --> 00:45:46,916
进来吧。

2030
00:45:49,666 --> 00:45:50,916
怎么了，卡森？

2031
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
警长，巴克先生想见你。

2032
00:45:56,916 --> 00:45:59,041
告诉那个人，我没有什么可对他说的。

2033
00:46:01,208 --> 00:46:02,291
这不是请求。

2034
00:46:11,416 --> 00:46:12,708
威利·埃斯科。

2035
00:46:14,791 --> 00:46:15,791
鲁弗斯。

2036
00:46:16,541 --> 00:46:19,250
当我在监狱里腐烂时，你想卖掉这个小镇吗？

2037
00:46:20,541 --> 00:46:22,083
你熟悉的世界已经消失。

2038
00:46:24,458 --> 00:46:25,750
有洪水来了。

2039
00:46:26,750 --> 00:46:29,458
你认为当它发生时你能抓住这个地方吗？

2040
00:46:30,958 --> 00:46:33,500
至少我知道的足够多，可以得到我的然后出去。

2041
00:46:35,458 --> 00:46:36,458
杀了我...

2042
00:46:38,833 --> 00:46:40,208
而你将一无所有。

2043
00:46:42,250 --> 00:46:45,958
你知道，像你这样的人会让我们都屈从到我们的日子结束

2044
00:46:46,041 --> 00:46:47,875


2045
00:46:47,958 --> 00:46:50,833
只要你能给自己买房子，徽章，

2046
00:46:50,916 --> 00:46:52,000


2047
00:46:52,916 --> 00:46:54,708
还有他们该死的金牙。

2048
00:47:00,375 --> 00:47:01,666
你想在这里做吗？

2049
00:47:09,416 --> 00:47:11,750
你去吧。 这就是你想要的，对吧？

2050
00:47:12,375 --> 00:47:13,916
这就是你来这里的目的？

2051
00:47:14,541 --> 00:47:17,041
我不会让你失望的。 来吧。

2052
00:47:18,250 --> 00:47:20,916
这就是你想要的。 想要更多？

2053
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:23,583
你想要更多，对吧？ 你还要一些吗？

2054
00:47:33,166 --> 00:47:34,875
过来，混蛋。

2055
00:47:36,125 --> 00:47:37,333
干得好。

2056
00:47:41,041 --> 00:47:43,083
妈的。 我做了打金。

2057
00:47:43,666 --> 00:47:46,916
嗨男孩。 过来。 来，拿那个金子。 得到那块金子。

2058
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:49,833
好的。 告诉你妈妈你现在很有钱！ 前进！

2059
00:48:03,291 --> 00:48:06,500
现在，我不会杀了你，威利。

2060
00:48:07,958 --> 00:48:09,791
你我曾经是朋友。

2061
00:48:11,375 --> 00:48:12,500
但知道这一点。

2062
00:48:13,208 --> 00:48:15,750
红木永远不会是你的，永远不会。

2063
00:48:16,458 --> 00:48:17,458
绝不。

2064
00:48:17,875 --> 00:48:21,041
事实上，这里不再欢迎你了。

2065
00:48:23,208 --> 00:48:24,208
现在...

2066
00:48:26,708 --> 00:48:30,000
我要你立即撤离，否则就死在你躺着的地方。

2067
00:48:32,875 --> 00:48:33,875
说什么？

2068
00:48:43,958 --> 00:48:44,958
没错。

2069
00:48:48,750 --> 00:48:51,416
<i>♪ 回家见我的主 ♪</i>

2070
00:48:51,500 --> 00:48:54,500
<i>♪ 回家见我的主 ♪</i>

2071
00:48:54,583 --> 00:48:55,958
<i>♪ 我要回家 ♪</i>

2072
00:48:56,041 --> 00:48:58,750
<i>♪ 我现在要回家见我的主 ♪</i>

2073
00:48:58,833 --> 00:49:01,250
<i>♪ 我要回家见我的主 ♪</i>

2074
00:49:01,333 --> 00:49:03,916
<i>♪ 我现在要回家见我的主 ♪</i>

2075
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,458
<i>♪ 我要回家见我的主 ♪</i>

2076
00:49:06,541 --> 00:49:08,416
<i>♪ 我现在要回家见我的主 ♪</i>

2077
00:50:02,250 --> 00:50:03,850
你可以把这些取下来一段时间。

2078
00:50:04,875 --> 00:50:05,875
是的。

2079
00:50:11,666 --> 00:50:14,916
告诉我一件事。 你怎么知道Rufus会在Redwood？

2080
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,080
他正在从他们的 Crimson Hoods 那里拿走这笔钱。

2081
00:50:17,125 --> 00:50:18,541
那就是他要去的地方。

2082
00:50:18,625 --> 00:50:21,166
现在你和一名元帅联手带他进来。

2083
00:50:21,250 --> 00:50:22,976
我不会带他进来。我要让他失望。

2084
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:24,666
而且我们不合作，老头。

2085
00:50:25,750 --> 00:50:28,333
你的生命是可消耗的，元帅。 我的帮派不是。

2086
00:50:30,416 --> 00:50:32,458
妈的，既然我们在这里，我应该告诉你......

2087
00:50:35,583 --> 00:50:37,125
我是想杀了你...

2088
00:50:39,375 --> 00:50:41,333
当你和你的伙伴们带来鲁弗斯时。

2089
00:50:42,458 --> 00:50:44,208
很多男人都在修理，儿子。

2090
00:50:44,791 --> 00:50:47,166
他们似乎总是在完成工作之前就死了。

2091
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,041
只是为了记录...

2092
00:50:52,666 --> 00:50:54,291
我一个人收留了鲁弗斯。

2093
00:51:14,208 --> 00:51:15,291
玛丽。

2094
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:19,000
我想你现在已经到了史密斯堡的一半了。

2095
00:51:19,083 --> 00:51:22,500
你可以放下那把枪，元帅。 这不是伏击。

2096
00:51:23,625 --> 00:51:26,791
另一方面，您可能希望随身携带。

2097
00:51:28,291 --> 00:51:29,791
你认为我愚蠢到会爱上你们在我的沙龙里扯的那些废话吗？

2098
00:51:29,875 --> 00:51:32,583


2099
00:51:32,666 --> 00:51:34,458
我不想让你再混进去了。

2100
00:51:35,291 --> 00:51:36,750
那你应该告诉我的。

2101
00:51:37,375 --> 00:51:40,125
我必须承认自己有一些原始的感觉。

2102
00:51:40,875 --> 00:51:43,500
这不是没有路可以请朋友旅行。

2103
00:51:43,583 --> 00:51:46,583
现在你拿走我们从 Crimson Hoods

2104
00:51:46,666 --> 00:51:48,958
上取下的钱，然后买下你一直喋喋不休的牧场。 唔？

2105
00:51:49,041 --> 00:51:52,541
你真是太慷慨了，但这不是这个帮派的运作方式。

2106
00:51:52,625 --> 00:51:56,000
在通常的地方住宿，准备在我们回来时以三种方式分享。

2107
00:51:56,083 --> 00:51:57,958
这是不是没有回来。

2108
00:51:59,791 --> 00:52:00,875
现在离开这里。

2109
00:52:01,958 --> 00:52:03,375
你们所有人。 这不是你的战斗。

2110
00:52:03,458 --> 00:52:06,458
你亲自对付魔鬼，你需要的不仅仅是你和元帅。

2111
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,458
我看到了魔鬼，而鲁弗斯·巴克不是他。

2112
00:52:10,625 --> 00:52:11,625
恶魔的白色。

2113
00:52:13,166 --> 00:52:15,125
你有想死的理由吗，吉姆？

2114
00:52:16,291 --> 00:52:18,041
除了你救我脱离这个？

2115
00:52:20,166 --> 00:52:23,416
此外，梦露说切诺基比尔和鲁弗斯一起跑。

2116
00:52:24,166 --> 00:52:25,541
每次我谈到我的速度时，一个混蛋都想把切诺基比尔拉出来。

2117
00:52:25,625 --> 00:52:28,333


2118
00:52:28,416 --> 00:52:30,666
我要一劳永逸地结束这场争论。

2119
00:52:30,750 --> 00:52:34,166
就像他们在<i>克拉伦斯之书</i>中所说的那样，“没有人能超越我。”

2120
00:52:34,250 --> 00:52:36,291
超速不是一个词，克拉伦斯也不是没有书。

2121
00:52:36,375 --> 00:52:38,935
我希望切诺基在你的屁股上放了一颗子弹只是为了让你闭嘴。

2122
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,125
- 嘿。
- 你把这些留在了我的墙上，爱先生。

2123
00:52:41,833 --> 00:52:43,753
想到我们要追捕恶棍，你会需要他们。

2124
00:52:43,791 --> 00:52:44,791
有义务的。

2125
00:53:12,875 --> 00:53:14,458
还在等什么？

2126
00:53:16,166 --> 00:53:17,958
你认为命运正在向你走来？

2127
00:53:18,583 --> 00:53:19,916
嘻嘻！ 走！

2128
00:53:28,041 --> 00:53:30,875
是的。 我知道。

2129
00:53:35,500 --> 00:53:36,500
前进。

2130
00:53:36,541 --> 00:53:38,291

2139
00:54:15,500 --> 00:54:16,541
我看起来怎么样？

2140
00:54:20,500 --> 00:54:21,541
好的。

2141
00:54:23,458 --> 00:54:24,625
大家都在吗？

2142
00:54:26,083 --> 00:54:27,166
大概。

2143
00:54:30,958 --> 00:54:32,250
你怎么能做到？

2144
00:54:33,833 --> 00:54:36,166
把这一切都留给威利？

2145
00:54:39,750 --> 00:54:41,208
如果你在跑红木，

2146
00:54:42,583 --> 00:54:44,416
谁会继续进行手术？

2147
00:54:45,958 --> 00:54:48,166
还有谁会让所有的帮派保持一致？

2148
00:54:48,750 --> 00:54:54,250
听着，我知道威利有他的方法，但他曾经忠诚过。

2149
00:54:55,791 --> 00:54:58,083
忠诚是一种美德，鲁弗斯。

2150
00:54:59,041 --> 00:55:00,041
直到它不是。

2151
00:55:03,833 --> 00:55:04,875
你忠于我？

2152
00:55:17,291 --> 00:55:18,500
看到这里的这些人了吗？

2153
00:55:20,041 --> 00:55:22,458
他们要么看不到，要么不想看。

2154
00:55:24,416 --> 00:55:26,416
但我相信你在做什么。

2155
00:55:27,375 --> 00:55:29,833
这个地方可以成为我们的乐土。

2156
00:55:30,750 --> 00:55:34,125
只要是这样，我就不会不做任何事情来完成它。

2157
00:55:43,041 --> 00:55:44,041
你告诉他们。

2158
00:56:04,708 --> 00:56:06,916
红木市民。

2159
00:56:08,375 --> 00:56:10,166
新的一天即将来临。

2160
00:56:11,250 --> 00:56:13,416
到目前为止，您无疑已经了解到，该领土将正式开放供定居。

2161
00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:17,291


2162
00:56:18,750 --> 00:56:22,625
现在他们说我们拥有的一切都将成为我们自己的。

2163
00:56:23,333 --> 00:56:26,000
但你和我一样知道那值多少钱。

2164
00:56:27,500 --> 00:56:31,375
你看，你的土地、你的生意、你的房子都被承诺给出价最高的人

2165
00:56:31,458 --> 00:56:34,333


2166
00:56:34,416 --> 00:56:37,875
由你的前任警长威利·埃斯科 (Wiley Escoe) 提供。

2167
00:56:39,500 --> 00:56:42,333
现在，巴克先生可以防止这种情况发生。

2168
00:56:42,916 --> 00:56:45,958
但为了让我们做到这一点，我们有必要征税。

2169
00:56:46,041 --> 00:56:47,708
我们要付出什么代价？

2170
00:56:48,375 --> 00:56:50,916
- 50,000 美元。
- 哦。

2171
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:55,583
你可以从这个镇上每一个活生生的灵魂身上榨取每一分钱，但它不会接近那个。

2172
00:56:55,666 --> 00:56:57,416


2173
00:56:57,500 --> 00:56:59,250
你让我们介于岩石和坚硬的地方之间。

2174
00:56:59,916 --> 00:57:01,958
你在这个国家生活了多久？

2175
00:57:02,750 --> 00:57:05,750
岩石和坚硬的地方就是我们所说的星期一。

2176
00:57:06,583 --> 00:57:08,166
我听说过鲁弗斯·巴克。

2177
00:57:08,750 --> 00:57:10,458
他是一个多么糟糕的人。

2178
00:57:11,375 --> 00:57:13,583
但他之前曾被关进监狱，

2179
00:57:14,291 --> 00:57:17,041
我想他很快就会回到那里。

2180
00:57:17,958 --> 00:57:21,375
他在的时候，也许我会回到这个小镇。

2181
00:57:22,166 --> 00:57:23,583
因为我不付钱。

2182
00:57:24,541 --> 00:57:26,458
你认为我为自己制作了红木？

2183
00:57:30,291 --> 00:57:31,291
什么目的？

2184
00:57:33,166 --> 00:57:35,791
红木不是藏身之处，因为我不藏。

2185
00:57:38,041 --> 00:57:39,291
这不是梦。

2186
00:57:39,791 --> 00:57:40,875
我不做梦。

2187
00:57:42,375 --> 00:57:43,500
你知道这是什么？

2188
00:57:45,125 --> 00:57:46,125
这是一个例子。

2189
00:57:48,416 --> 00:57:49,666
这是一个例子...

2190
00:57:51,875 --> 00:57:53,291
供其他人跟随。

2191
00:57:55,125 --> 00:57:56,250
和你...

2192
00:57:57,708 --> 00:58:01,125
你是进步的敌人。

2193
00:58:03,750 --> 00:58:05,875
请。 请。

2194
00:58:07,708 --> 00:58:09,916
- 我有一个家庭。
- 你叫什么名字？

2195
00:58:11,416 --> 00:58:12,708
詹姆士。

2196
00:58:19,583 --> 00:58:21,041
安息吧，詹姆斯。

2197
00:58:25,166 --> 00:58:27,708
现在，多少钱？

2198
00:58:28,833 --> 00:58:30,625
能集齐多少？

2199
00:58:31,541 --> 00:58:32,708
万。

2200
00:58:33,500 --> 00:58:35,666
也许是 15，如果每一分钱都可以挤出来的话。

2201
00:58:35,750 --> 00:58:36,750
嗯嗯。

2202
00:58:37,583 --> 00:58:40,541
在我们收集所有物品之前，不会有人离开城镇。

2203
00:58:41,291 --> 00:58:43,333
如果你不遵守，

2204
00:58:43,916 --> 00:58:47,833
你和你爱的一切都会燃烧。

2205
00:59:10,833 --> 00:59:12,500
我没有什么可抢劫的。

2206
00:59:14,166 --> 00:59:15,958
但我有人要开枪。

2207
00:59:16,458 --> 00:59:17,458
下台。

2208
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:25,208
威利·埃斯科。

2209
00:59:26,041 --> 00:59:27,083
巴斯·里夫斯。

2210
00:59:27,833 --> 00:59:28,833
他妈的。

2211
00:59:29,333 --> 00:59:31,166
红木与枪手一起爬行。

2212
00:59:31,250 --> 00:59:33,916
Rufus 拿了 12 个，拿走了我的 6 个。

2213
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:35,708
谁知道他现在得到了多少。

2214
00:59:35,791 --> 00:59:38,166
我不相信这个人说的话。

2215
00:59:38,666 --> 00:59:39,666
他是侦察员。

2216
00:59:40,125 --> 00:59:41,625
我说我们杀了他。

2217
00:59:42,625 --> 00:59:44,250
我们把剩下的牙齿拔掉。

2218
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:46,583
你打过警长吗，男孩？

2219
00:59:47,500 --> 00:59:48,500
市长？

2220
00:59:49,625 --> 00:59:51,708
比射杀普通人难一点。

2221
00:59:52,500 --> 00:59:53,500
而我两者都是。

2222
00:59:53,583 --> 00:59:57,708
你们都活着，死了，因为鲁弗斯不喜欢散漫的结局。

2223
00:59:58,333 --> 01:00:02,291
除非你有内幕消息，否则法律不要找到像鲁弗斯巴克这样的人。

2224
01:00:02,375 --> 01:00:03,583
是不是，威利？

2225
01:00:04,458 --> 01:00:07,166
如果我按照我的方式，你就在鲁弗斯旁边的监狱下面。

2226
01:00:07,958 --> 01:00:10,666
但是您与自己达成了交易，结果反而佩戴了徽章。

2227
01:00:10,750 --> 01:00:14,291
你有你想要鲁弗斯离开的理由，我也有我的。

2228
01:00:15,125 --> 01:00:17,041
敌人的敌人不是朋友吗？

2229
01:00:17,958 --> 01:00:21,541
鲁弗斯试图拯救雷德伍德。 但为此，他需要钱。

2230
01:00:22,333 --> 01:00:23,791
这是他没有的一件事。

2231
01:00:23,875 --> 01:00:27,541
好吧，看这里。 你和魔鬼做了一笔交易。

2232
01:00:30,416 --> 01:00:31,583
现在他来收了。

2233
01:00:33,666 --> 01:00:34,666
你好好休息，

2234
01:00:35,208 --> 01:00:36,500
但在日出之前离开。

2235
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,666
或者它会从坏到坏。 你听？

2236
01:00:57,875 --> 01:00:58,875
哦。

2237
01:01:03,250 --> 01:01:04,458
元帅。

2238
01:01:05,166 --> 01:01:07,500
元帅。 元帅。

2239
01:01:07,583 --> 01:01:09,416
所有这些诡计都会让你丧命，儿子。

2240
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:12,375
听着，元帅。

2241
01:01:12,958 --> 01:01:16,125
我比任何武器都快。 你可以相信这一点。

2242
01:01:16,208 --> 01:01:17,375
我看到的更快。

2243
01:01:18,916 --> 01:01:21,083
好的。 在哪里？

2244
01:01:21,708 --> 01:01:22,916
镜子里。

2245
01:01:26,875 --> 01:01:28,541
黑人说：“在镜子里。”

2246
01:01:28,625 --> 01:01:29,791
我很……对不起。

2247
01:01:29,875 --> 01:01:33,791
我宁愿骑着黑马骑着一匹金色的种马参加枪战。

2248
01:01:35,583 --> 01:01:38,625
- 他妈的这是什么意思？
- 闪亮的狗屎被击中。

2249
01:01:39,791 --> 01:01:40,791
你要拍我？

2250
01:01:43,666 --> 01:01:45,625
你怎么看，律师？

2251
01:01:46,416 --> 01:01:48,125
我想你们都会死。

信息从哪里来？

2260
01:02:37,083 --> 01:02:38,083
红木。

2261
01:02:39,250 --> 01:02:41,500
你知道我们不能相信威利的话。

2262
01:02:41,583 --> 01:02:45,250
在我们采取下一步行动之前，必须有人了解这片土地。

2263
01:02:45,333 --> 01:02:47,500
是的，玛丽，但有人不一定是你。

2264

比尔和贝克沃斯也是如此。

2267

如果你忘记了，你的脸比我们所有人的脸加起来还要出名，驿马车玛丽。

2268
01:02:55,958 --> 01:03:00,166


2269
01:03:00,750 --> 01:03:02,833
从这里到德克萨斯州的那间轿车的广告中得到了它。

2270
01:03:02,916 --> 01:03:03,958


2271
01:03:04,708 --> 01:03:07,416
这就是为什么我可以骑车进城的原因。

2272
01:03:08,333 --> 01:03:10,666
大家都知道我在买轿车。

2273
01:03:10,750 --> 01:03:13,583
鲁弗斯需要钱。 我要在特鲁迪·史密斯的位置上向他提出要约...

2274
01:03:13,666 --> 01:03:16,416
玛丽，我性格中的什么让你认为我会允许？

2275
01:03:17,833 --> 01:03:19,666
我不是在征求你的同意。

2276
01:03:24,958 --> 01:03:26,000
好的。

2277
01:03:28,291 --> 01:03:30,708
那我……我想我只会向你要你的。

2278
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:34,750
既然你永远不会让男人放弃你，

2279
01:03:34,833 --> 01:03:37,291
我只需要直接问你。

2280
01:03:45,750 --> 01:03:47,875
那是我父亲给我母亲的戒指。

2281
01:03:50,166 --> 01:03:52,125
我本来打算在道格拉斯还给你的。

2282
01:03:54,750 --> 01:03:56,041
但你没有。

2283
01:03:59,083 --> 01:04:00,250
我现在是。

2284
01:04:04,875 --> 01:04:06,958
我曾经讨厌对你感到无助。

2285
01:04:09,083 --> 01:04:10,625
那些日子现在已经过去了。

2286
01:04:12,750 --> 01:04:13,750
玛丽...

2287
01:04:15,208 --> 01:04:18,333
当尘埃落定，我们将分道扬镳，永远。

2288
01:04:22,375 --> 01:04:25,000
但直到尘埃落定。 我在这里直到那时。

2289
01:04:52,375 --> 01:04:53,375

女士，您是 Redwood 的居民吗？

2296
01:05:43,458 --> 01:05:46,958
你没有足够的自信去问我住在哪里。

2297
01:05:47,666 --> 01:05:51,291
好吧，这把枪说回答了该死的问题。

2298
01:05:53,625 --> 01:05:56,208
算了，这枪不说了。

2299
01:06:03,291 --> 01:06:05,416
驿马车玛丽。

2300
01:06:08,333 --> 01:06:09,833
可怕的格特鲁德史密斯。

2301
01:06:10,833 --> 01:06:14,375
我自己更喜欢奸诈的特鲁迪，但我会接受。

2302
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:16,541
是什么让你来到我的小镇？

2303
01:06:18,750 --> 01:06:20,708
我听说鲁弗斯·巴克回来了。

2304
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,291
新闻传播得很快。

2305
01:06:24,375 --> 01:06:26,541
我有一个他可能想听的提议。

2306
01:06:28,166 --> 01:06:29,375
好吧，你得到的任何报价，

2307
01:06:30,791 --> 01:06:32,375
你可以给我做。

2308
01:06:34,416 --> 01:06:36,166
我不做生意的帮助。

2309
01:06:40,125 --> 01:06:41,541

但我没有把耳朵贴在地上就不能成为驿马车玛丽·菲尔兹

2332
01:08:54,916 --> 01:08:58,333
我的耳朵告诉我，你刚刚失去了 25 岁。

2333
01:09:00,541 --> 01:09:02,583
我希望你的提议能对抗你的神经......

2334
01:09:02,666 --> 01:09:05,250
请允许我完成的纬度。

2335
01:09:09,083 --> 01:09:11,166
我在道格拉斯的沙龙正在蓬勃发展。

2336
01:09:11,708 --> 01:09:14,875
在 Elks 给我买了另一家，我也在
Cascade 开了一家餐馆。

2337
01:09:15,458 --> 01:09:18,083
总而言之，我可以把这个从你手中拿走。

2338
01:09:21,750 --> 01:09:24,958
一提到我的名字就能带来好生意

2339
01:09:25,458 --> 01:09:27,833
任何附属机构，而，

2340
01:09:28,375 --> 01:09:32,833
恕我直言，但鲁弗斯·巴克这个名字让人害怕。

2341
01:09:37,833 --> 01:09:39,041
我们知道你是谁。

2342
01:09:42,333 --> 01:09:48,666
你带着那个提议走进我的小镇是有风险的。

2343
01:09:49,625 --> 01:09:54,083
除非有更多的风险，否则像你这样的女人不会把自己绑在这种风险上。

2344
01:09:54,166 --> 01:09:56,291


2345
01:09:58,416 --> 01:10:00,958
看，我不相信巧合，

2346
01:10:01,708 --> 01:10:03,083
就像你会在 Crimson Hoods

2347
01:10:03,166 --> 01:10:06,708
被我的钱伏击后马上走进这里一样。

2348
01:10:08,916 --> 01:10:10,208
你在想什么？

2349
01:10:15,583 --> 01:10:16,666
哎呀。

2350
01:10:17,250 --> 01:10:19,416
你一定忘记了门上写的是谁的名字。

2351
01:10:21,541 --> 01:10:22,875
再来一轮。

2352
01:10:23,416 --> 01:10:25,916
我们有一个派对，你们。 来吧。

2353
01:11:12,416 --> 01:11:13,541
好的，玛丽。

2354
01:11:15,666 --> 01:11:16,666
好的。

2355
01:11:20,041 --> 01:11:22,958
所以你还说你对那笔钱一无所知，你一个人来了？

2356
01:11:23,041 --> 01:11:24,500


2357
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:27,000
没错。

2358
01:11:27,833 --> 01:11:31,041
你一路骑到这里来杀了自己。

2359
01:11:31,833 --> 01:11:32,875
为了什么？

2360
01:11:33,875 --> 01:11:34,875
爱情？

2361
01:11:35,833 --> 01:11:38,166
爱是唯一值得为之而死的东西。

2362
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,125
但你对此一无所知。

2363
01:11:48,083 --> 01:11:49,083
你懂，

2364
01:11:50,291 --> 01:11:52,166
我有一个姐姐叫玛丽。

2365
01:11:58,583 --> 01:12:03,291
她很漂亮，意志坚强，和你一样。

2366
01:12:05,833 --> 01:12:07,375
她在我 11 岁时死于小儿麻痹症。

2367
01:12:09,541 --> 01:12:12,958
总是很痛苦，但她从不让我看到她哭。

2368
01:12:13,916 --> 01:12:14,916
嗯。

2369
01:12:16,708 --> 01:12:19,750
我们住着一个叫霍普的女孩。

2370
01:12:20,750 --> 01:12:24,083
大胖子，总是挑小孩子。

2371
01:12:24,833 --> 01:12:26,625
显然是出于嫉妒。

2372
01:12:27,833 --> 01:12:29,666
但她从不跟我操。

2373
01:12:31,500 --> 01:12:33,416
她充满激情地憎恨玛丽，

2374
01:12:34,250 --> 01:12:38,583
总是取笑她有多瘦多虚弱。

2375
01:12:39,791 --> 01:12:41,083
后来有一天，

2376
01:12:42,125 --> 01:12:44,583
希望路过我们家，

2377
01:12:45,250 --> 01:12:48,000
一只手拿着苹果，另一只手拿着刀片。

2378
01:12:50,583 --> 01:12:54,083
她决定把苹果扔到街对面的玛丽，

2379
01:12:55,291 --> 01:12:59,208
它击中了我姐姐的头部，使她失去平衡。

2380
01:12:59,291 --> 01:13:00,875
她从台阶上摔下来。

2381
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:04,291
弄断了她的脚踝。

2382
01:13:05,500 --> 01:13:06,500
而现在那...

2383
01:13:07,666 --> 01:13:11,666
那是我第一次也是唯一一次亲眼看到我姐姐哭泣。

2384
01:13:13,625 --> 01:13:17,791
霍普站在那里嘲笑她那该死的丑陋面孔。

2385
01:13:21,833 --> 01:13:22,833
我爸...

2386
01:13:25,958 --> 01:13:27,333
他回到家，

2387
01:13:29,166 --> 01:13:34,041
他脱下腰带，打<i>我</i>不保护我妹妹。

2388
01:13:36,125 --> 01:13:39,208
他鞭打我，直到我全身麻木。

2389
01:13:42,166 --> 01:13:43,166
然后

2390
01:13:44,291 --> 01:13:47,125
他去霍普家对她做同样的事情。

2391
01:13:49,333 --> 01:13:54,166
当他到达那里时，他看到她全家站在房子的一边，所有人都在尖叫和哭泣，

2392
01:13:54,250 --> 01:13:56,583


2393
01:13:58,666 --> 01:13:59,958
还有希望……

2394
01:14:02,250 --> 01:14:04,458
躺在血泊中的地板上。

2395
01:14:06,250 --> 01:14:09,208
有人割开了她的喉咙。

2396
01:14:10,583 --> 01:14:12,125
用自己的刀杀了她。

2397
01:14:16,916 --> 01:14:19,041
爸爸无语了。

2398
01:14:19,791 --> 01:14:22,708
他回家后没跟我说一句话。

2399
01:14:24,333 --> 01:14:25,458
第二天，

2400
01:14:26,583 --> 01:14:28,791
他让我和祖父母住在一起。

2401
01:14:30,375 --> 01:14:32,875
然后下次我见到我姐姐的时候，

2402
01:14:34,291 --> 01:14:36,208
她躺在棺材里。

2403
01:14:38,375 --> 01:14:39,875
疾病杀死了她。

2404
01:14:47,125 --> 01:14:49,458
我很抱歉你姐姐不得不受苦。

2405
01:14:53,833 --> 01:14:55,666
我钦佩她的勇敢。

2406
01:14:59,375 --> 01:15:01,625
但你从我这里得不到任何消息。

2407
01:15:04,666 --> 01:15:05,666
你懂，

2408
01:15:06,458 --> 01:15:08,958
我真的很佩服<i>你</i>的勇敢。

2409
01:15:13,250 --> 01:15:15,666
但恐怕结局还是结局。

2410
01:15:16,583 --> 01:15:17,625
希望

2411
01:15:18,750 --> 01:15:19,875
一定死。

2412
01:15:34,208 --> 01:15:35,208
但尚未。

2413
01:15:49,416 --> 01:15:52,541
把她留在街上，让每个人都能看到她。

2414
01:15:52,625 --> 01:15:55,833
没有人来收集她的“日出前，在她的头上放一颗子弹”。

2415
01:15:55,916 --> 01:15:56,916
是的女士。

2416
01:15:58,666 --> 01:16:00,458
看来不用等那么久了。

2417
01:16:35,083 --> 01:16:36,541
谁先死，对吧？

2418
01:16:37,166 --> 01:16:39,125
- 谁先死。  - 嗯嗯。

2419
01:16:43,083 --> 01:16:44,083
让她起来。

2420
01:16:45,875 --> 01:16:47,500
“谁先死”？

2421
01:16:49,208 --> 01:16:51,291
现在，这是什么蠢话？

2422
01:16:52,125 --> 01:16:53,666
你们两个想在这里被枪杀？

2423
01:16:55,166 --> 01:16:58,166
纳特爱。 多么可预测。

2424
01:16:59,083 --> 01:17:02,708
你预测我的朋友比尔·皮克特瞄准的是你的圆顶礼帽？

2425
01:17:05,125 --> 01:17:07,333
在你的孩子们瞄准目标之前你就已经死了。

2426
01:17:07,416 --> 01:17:09,000
然后你就死了。

2427
01:17:10,791 --> 01:17:13,375
但是你的老板不会看到这笔钱的一分钱。

2428
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:15,208
我的老板？

2429
01:17:16,291 --> 01:17:17,291
他在哪里？

2430
01:17:18,708 --> 01:17:20,000
谁在哪里？

2431
01:17:20,541 --> 01:17:21,541
元帅。

2432
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:24,375
我在说英语，是吗？

2433
01:17:24,458 --> 01:17:26,541
- 对我来说听起来像英语。  - 嗯嗯。

2434
01:17:26,625 --> 01:17:28,208
鲁弗斯·巴克在哪里？

2435
01:17:28,875 --> 01:17:29,875
哦。

2436
01:17:30,625 --> 01:17:31,625
呵呵。

2437
01:17:34,708 --> 01:17:35,708
低音。

2438
01:17:36,291 --> 01:17:37,333
特鲁迪。

2439
01:17:37,416 --> 01:17:40,958
如果我知道你在改变立场，我会邀请你来加入我们的。

2440
01:17:45,375 --> 01:17:47,500
你是来救你遇险的姑娘的吗？

2441
01:18:00,666 --> 01:18:02,958
你看起来不难听。

2442
01:18:04,583 --> 01:18:05,583
所以我再问你一次。

2443
01:18:07,291 --> 01:18:08,666
鲁弗斯·巴克在哪里？

2444
01:18:09,541 --> 01:18:12,333
嗯，很明显，你不认识我。

2445
01:18:14,791 --> 01:18:16,125
告诉你的人去，

2446
01:18:17,125 --> 01:18:18,625
但你留下，

2447
01:18:19,791 --> 01:18:22,541
也许你的少女会活得久一点。

2448
01:18:31,791 --> 01:18:32,791
元帅。

2449
01:18:36,625 --> 01:18:37,625
哦。

2450
01:18:38,208 --> 01:18:39,458
虽然你很漂亮。

2451
01:18:43,166 --> 01:18:45,500
- 啊，把她的屁股放回去。
- 是的女士。

2452
01:18:45,583 --> 01:18:47,083
来给我喝

2453
01:18:47,166 --> 01:18:48,166
嘿。

2454
01:18:48,875 --> 01:18:50,955
我听到的快速抽奖是什么，切诺基比尔？

2455
01:18:52,041 --> 01:18:55,041
我听到你说得太快以至于你的对手没有时间画画

2456
01:18:55,875 --> 01:18:57,666
在你把两个放进去之前。

2457
01:18:59,250 --> 01:19:00,583
不，那不是我。

2458
01:19:01,625 --> 01:19:05,083
我是切诺基比尔，它会向说话太多的人开枪。

2459
01:19:06,875 --> 01:19:08,500
那我就让你轻松点。

2460
01:19:09,666 --> 01:19:10,791
你先画。

2461
01:19:12,666 --> 01:19:15,750
你以为这是什么？  “谁在西部抽签最快？”

2462
01:19:15,833 --> 01:19:17,750
一切都归结为谁禁食谁不禁食，对吧？

2463
01:19:17,833 --> 01:19:21,333
不，这一切都归结为谁活着谁死了。

2464
01:19:24,375 --> 01:19:26,208
特鲁迪，我要给我弄点喝的。

2465
01:19:27,791 --> 01:19:28,708
晚安。

2466
01:19:29,958 --> 01:19:31,708
嘿，嘿，喝，我的屁股，伙计。

2467
01:19:31,791 --> 01:19:33,750
- 我整晚都在练习这种对峙。
- 吉姆。

2468
01:19:33,833 --> 01:19:36,267
- 你不会走开。
- 离开这里。

2469
01:19:36,291 --> 01:19:37,976
- 不，没人...
- 离开这里，吉姆。

2470
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,000
- 那只鸡...
- 现在不是时候

2471
01:19:40,500 --> 01:19:41,541
好的。 好的。

2472
01:19:47,208 --> 01:19:48,208
三月，男孩。

2473
01:19:48,625 --> 01:19:50,833
- 我说行军！
- 行进。

2474
01:19:52,666 --> 01:19:56,750
呼，二，三，四。

2475
01:20:15,416 --> 01:20:16,416
足够了。

2476
01:20:42,666 --> 01:20:43,750
他们打你不好？

2477
01:20:52,375 --> 01:20:53,791
我要把他们都杀了。

2478
01:21:49,250 --> 01:21:51,416
你熟悉拿破仑吗？

2479
01:21:56,583 --> 01:22:00,166
他说：“我被驱赶到一个我不知道的终点。”

2480
01:22:01,416 --> 01:22:02,625
“当我到达时，

2481
01:22:03,416 --> 01:22:05,416
因为我将变得不必要，

2482
01:22:06,708 --> 01:22:09,625
一个原子就足以粉碎我。”

2483
01:22:11,125 --> 01:22:15,708
“在此之前，人类的所有势力都无法阻止我。”

2484
01:22:18,166 --> 01:22:20,333
那是一个完全知道自己是谁的人。

2485
01:22:21,708 --> 01:22:23,083
最重要的是，

2486
01:22:24,500 --> 01:22:26,750
他知道他的时代即将结束。

2487
01:22:30,708 --> 01:22:31,708
砍倒他。

2488
01:22:41,250 --> 01:22:42,250
你知道为什么...

2489
01:22:44,208 --> 01:22:45,791
我给了你那个伤疤？

2490
01:22:47,958 --> 01:22:49,291
所以我会记得你。

2491
01:22:53,333 --> 01:22:54,333
不。

2492
01:22:55,541 --> 01:22:59,833
不，我给了你那道伤疤，所以当你回到我身边时我能认出你的脸。

2493
01:23:01,791 --> 01:23:03,000
纳特爱，

2494
01:23:04,250 --> 01:23:06,500
抢劫不法之徒的不法之徒，

2495
01:23:07,875 --> 01:23:14,500
不留情面地追捕侵犯他的人的死亡天使。

2496
01:23:14,583 --> 01:23:16,041
我知道你是谁。

2497
01:23:17,708 --> 01:23:20,000
我看到了你不会越过的界限。

2498
01:23:22,333 --> 01:23:24,375
看，我知道另一边是什么。

2499
01:23:29,875 --> 01:23:31,166
为殴打道歉。

2500
01:23:33,500 --> 01:23:35,958
这更多地表明，如果我们无法达成协议，菲尔兹女士可能会看到什么。

2501
01:23:36,041 --> 01:23:38,333


2502
01:23:40,958 --> 01:23:42,291
什么条款？

2503
01:23:43,458 --> 01:23:47,250
你会在周五中午之前归还你从我这里偷的钱。

2504
01:23:47,333 --> 01:23:48,625
不一会儿。

2505
01:23:49,750 --> 01:23:53,083
并且您将在此基础上增加 10,000 美元。 我们称之为兴趣。

2506
01:23:55,250 --> 01:23:56,166
有什么好笑的？

2507
01:23:56,250 --> 01:23:59,291
哦，该死，你怎么……你怎么认为我会明白的？

2508
01:23:59,875 --> 01:24:01,125
你要抢银行。

2509
01:24:03,791 --> 01:24:06,125
Nat Love 要去抢银行。

2510
01:24:08,375 --> 01:24:12,083
在此期间，我提前表示感谢。

2511
01:24:14,500 --> 01:24:16,083
来吧，打开它。

2512
01:24:46,125 --> 01:24:48,125
我希望周五能拿到钱。

2513
01:24:49,291 --> 01:24:50,291
所有的。

2514
01:25:06,708 --> 01:25:08,416
你知道我不能让你那样做。

2515
01:25:11,541 --> 01:25:14,666
如果三天后这笔钱不在鲁弗斯手里，玛丽就会死。

2516
01:25:16,041 --> 01:25:17,791
无论如何，我们谈论的是哪家银行？

2517
01:25:17,875 --> 01:25:18,875
梅斯维尔。

2518
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:22,000
梅斯维尔？

2519
01:25:23,083 --> 01:25:24,000
那是一个白色的小镇。

2520
01:25:24,083 --> 01:25:26,416
是的，这就是为什么他们的银行里会有 10,000 美元。

2521
01:25:28,041 --> 01:25:29,041
这太疯狂了。

2522
01:25:29,125 --> 01:25:31,041
我的情绪很混乱。

2523
01:25:31,125 --> 01:25:33,291
我的意思是，皮克特，我同意。 这很疯狂。

2524
01:25:33,958 --> 01:25:35,958
但是，纳特，我也同意你告诉元帅我们无论如何都会做那件事。

2525
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:37,791


2526
01:25:38,333 --> 01:25:39,916
那是一些真正的非法狗屎。

2527
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:42,083
- 我们取缔，不是吗？
- 不是“我们”，吉姆。

2528
01:25:43,041 --> 01:25:45,666
在你在镇上拉的那件事之后，我们几乎都被杀了。

2529
01:25:45,750 --> 01:25:46,583
我有那个。

2530
01:25:46,666 --> 01:25:48,809
取回你从深红头巾那里拿走的钱。

2531
01:25:48,833 --> 01:25:50,250
皮克特，孩子，你跟我来。

2532
01:25:51,250 --> 01:25:53,875
如果鲁弗斯·巴克想把那家银行拿走，他为什么不派自己的手下呢？

2533
01:25:53,958 --> 01:25:55,625
这样他就干净了，明白吗？

2534
01:25:56,375 --> 01:25:58,291
我得像白天一样光着身子进去，

2535
01:25:58,833 --> 01:26:02,791
一个刚出道的银行劫匪，在全国各地张贴通缉海报。

2536
01:26:02,875 --> 01:26:05,458
在你开门之前，他们会像苍蝇一样在你身上。

2537
01:26:05,541 --> 01:26:06,625
是的。

2538
01:26:07,500 --> 01:26:09,833
我说<i>我</i>必须被认可。

2539
01:26:12,958 --> 01:26:14,041
前进。

2540
01:26:30,666 --> 01:26:31,958
一定不行。

2541
01:26:42,083 --> 01:26:43,083
对于玛丽。

2542
01:26:59,708 --> 01:27:02,375
哇！ 呼！

2543
01:27:02,458 --> 01:27:03,458
死里逃生。

2544
01:27:03,875 --> 01:27:05,708
关闭他妈的剃须！

2545
01:27:05,791 --> 01:27:07,958
我以为我爱上了一个小伙子。

2546
01:27:08,041 --> 01:27:09,500
这就是为什么我什么也没说。

2547
01:27:09,583 --> 01:27:11,916
好吧，我不是唯一的。 我不能...

2548
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:14,250
我不能......不仅仅是我。 不仅仅是我。

2549
01:27:14,833 --> 01:27:15,833
只是你，吉姆。

2550
01:27:31,583 --> 01:27:34,000
<i>♪ 跟随，跟随 他们跟随的人 ♪</i>

2551
01:27:34,083 --> 01:27:36,958
<i>♪ 他们认识的人都在抄袭 去我的石窟 ♪</i>

2552
01:27:37,041 --> 01:27:40,000
<i>♪ 他们把我看成精灵 试着把我关在瓶子里 ♪</i>

2553
01:27:40,083 --> 01:27:42,875

01:27:42,958 --> 01:27:45,916

2555
01:28:05,833 --> 01:28:07,000
现在吉杜普。

2556
01:28:17,916 --> 01:28:19,166
允许我。

2557
01:28:32,416 --> 01:28:33,583
你的真实姓名是什么？

2558
01:28:34,500 --> 01:28:35,750
Cuffee我的真名。

2559
01:28:37,166 --> 01:28:38,625
我出生时的名字？

2560
01:28:38,708 --> 01:28:39,875
国泰威廉姆斯。

2561
01:28:48,833 --> 01:28:51,166
国泰，你走路不如骑。

2562
01:28:51,250 --> 01:28:53,750
洛夫先生，我妈妈总是告诉我要尊重我的长辈，所以我不会说出我的想法。

2563
01:28:53,833 --> 01:28:55,583


2564
01:28:55,666 --> 01:28:57,583
没关系。 我能读懂你的心。

2565
01:28:57,666 --> 01:28:59,166
那么我很抱歉你不得不听到这个。

2566
01:29:13,250 --> 01:29:14,458
前进。

2567
01:29:17,208 --> 01:29:18,333
加油，亲爱的。

2568
01:29:37,666 --> 01:29:38,750
是的？

2569
01:29:40,791 --> 01:29:42,375
我想提款。

2570
01:29:50,416 --> 01:29:51,416
哦。

2571
01:29:56,541 --> 01:29:57,541
什么...

2572
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:01,541
女士，您必须有一个帐户。

2573
01:30:01,625 --> 01:30:07,208
而且，好吧，我会为此推荐杰里科的一家银行或者红木银行。

2574
01:30:07,291 --> 01:30:08,375
哦。

2575
01:30:08,458 --> 01:30:10,666
我不是在谈论那种退缩。

2576
01:30:11,458 --> 01:30:12,458
我说话...

2577
01:30:15,291 --> 01:30:16,291
我在说...

2578
01:30:18,875 --> 01:30:21,333
谈论那种。

2579
01:30:39,208 --> 01:30:40,375
嘿，蓝眼睛。

2580
01:30:42,500 --> 01:30:43,500
你害怕。

2581
01:30:44,458 --> 01:30:45,818
你的手在颤抖。 你会想念的。

2582
01:30:47,041 --> 01:30:48,041
我不会。

2583
01:30:53,666 --> 01:30:54,666
呼气。

2584
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:10,000
阿塔博伊。

2585
01:31:11,666 --> 01:31:12,875
我不喜欢我的搭档。

2586
01:31:12,958 --> 01:31:16,833
他不想向任何人开枪，但突然间，我有心了。

2587
01:31:16,916 --> 01:31:19,541
现在打开他妈的门。

2588
01:31:24,541 --> 01:31:25,541
觉得我现在很有趣吗？

2589
01:31:27,833 --> 01:31:29,208
你在看什么？

2590
01:31:29,291 --> 01:31:30,666
把所有的顾客都弄过来。

2591
01:31:30,750 --> 01:31:32,375
- 让他们过去！
- 好吧好吧。

2592
01:31:32,458 --> 01:31:35,083
- 请大家快点这边。
- 你也是。 移动！

2593
01:31:39,666 --> 01:31:42,625
时代变了，不是吗？

2594
01:31:51,375 --> 01:31:53,375
他们说抢劫银行是一项艰苦的工作。

2595
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:56,833
那是谎言。 抢银行很容易。

2596
01:31:58,291 --> 01:32:01,333
困难的部分是在不杀戮的情况下做到这一点。

2597
01:32:03,416 --> 01:32:04,416
那么，会是什么...

2598
01:32:07,416 --> 01:32:08,416
经理先生？

2599
01:32:16,125 --> 01:32:17,000
好人。

2600
01:32:26,250 --> 01:32:27,625
来吧。 我们走吧。

2601
01:32:28,500 --> 01:32:29,791
来吧。 吉迪亚普。 走。

2602
01:32:31,166 --> 01:32:32,375
好啦好啦。

2603
01:32:35,791 --> 01:32:37,958
- 快乐银行与您。
- 好的，先生。

2604
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:41,000
纳特爱。

2605
01:33:10,750 --> 01:33:12,125
甚至看起来不像很多。

2606
01:33:13,291 --> 01:33:16,000
不是它的样子。 这是它可以给你买的东西。

2607
01:33:16,541 --> 01:33:19,416
Rufus 拿到那笔钱后不会让 Mary 走的。

2608
01:33:20,208 --> 01:33:21,416
是的，我知道。

2609
01:33:22,041 --> 01:33:25,791
他会杀了她，让我走，所以我会随身携带伤害。

2610
01:33:26,833 --> 01:33:29,208
那又怎样，我们只是白白经历了那么多麻烦？

2611
01:33:30,250 --> 01:33:31,791
现在我们得到了他想要的东西。

2612
01:33:33,583 --> 01:33:34,583
就是这样？

2613
01:33:35,750 --> 01:33:36,958
必须是。

2614
01:33:40,166 --> 01:33:43,000
如果你愿意，你可以草率地射我，或者你可以等着看我先带什么。

2615
01:33:43,083 --> 01:33:46,208


2616
01:33:49,875 --> 01:33:51,791
哦。

2617
01:33:51,875 --> 01:33:54,791
鲁弗斯在这些山丘上都有这样的藏匿处。

2618
01:33:55,416 --> 01:33:56,916
一个小军队就够了。

2619
01:33:57,875 --> 01:34:00,000
不要没有人接受我来找我的东西。

2620
01:34:01,416 --> 01:34:03,083
甚至恶魔本人也不行。

2621
01:34:03,166 --> 01:34:04,791
鲁弗斯·巴克是个男人。

2622
01:34:04,875 --> 01:34:07,208
你们最好接受这个事实。

2623
01:34:07,291 --> 01:34:08,291
人或鬼，

2624
01:34:09,041 --> 01:34:11,208
这将是巴克在生者中的最后一天。

下午。

我会叫你跑去找你的上司，但这就像要求你跑去找你爸爸一样。

2640
01:36:28,250 --> 01:36:29,375
可能是任何人，对吧？

2641
01:36:29,458 --> 01:36:30,458
唔。

2642
01:36:30,875 --> 01:36:31,875
你懂，

2643
01:36:33,166 --> 01:36:34,875
我愿意赌我的右臂

2644
01:36:36,166 --> 01:36:38,125
我的尸体数量比你多。

2645
01:36:39,666 --> 01:36:40,875
儿子，那是个糟糕的赌注。

2646
01:36:42,458 --> 01:36:46,833
我喜欢那首歌或你在那里吹口哨的任何东西。

2647
01:36:47,666 --> 01:36:48,958
走吧，杰瑞。 走。

2648
01:36:54,500 --> 01:36:55,583
那是我们的钱？

2649
01:36:56,166 --> 01:36:57,500
呃...

2650
01:36:59,375 --> 01:37:00,375
与我同行。

2651
01:37:01,625 --> 01:37:03,208
嘿，就……跟我走吧。

2652
01:37:03,708 --> 01:37:06,000
- 留意这个，天使。  - 嗯嗯。

2653
01:37:27,291 --> 01:37:30,500
你知道他们称你的老板为魔鬼吗？

2654
01:37:32,875 --> 01:37:34,750
连魔鬼也需要钱，对吧？

2655
01:37:36,458 --> 01:37:40,625
所以就像我们如何拥有那笔钱一样......

2656
01:37:43,208 --> 01:37:46,166
让我来规定参与条款。

2657
01:37:59,333 --> 01:38:02,333
那是什么鬼？ 那是什么鬼东西，老铁？

2658
01:38:03,916 --> 01:38:05,276
这是右臂还是左臂？

2659
01:38:08,041 --> 01:38:09,041
天啊。

2660
01:38:10,125 --> 01:38:12,208
嗯，现在我们...

2661
01:38:14,291 --> 01:38:15,291
有你们。

2662
01:40:22,083 --> 01:40:23,416
哇。

2663
01:40:28,541 --> 01:40:29,833
哇哇哇哇哇哇哇哇哇哇哇哇哇哇哇哇哇哇哇哇哇哇哇哇哇哇哇哇哇哇哇哇

2664
01:40:31,250 --> 01:40:33,291
你可以在这里抓住你的好朋友。

2665
01:40:34,083 --> 01:40:35,283
你有一个吵闹的小流氓。

2666
01:40:36,500 --> 01:40:38,434
- 玛丽。
- 是的，我们会做到这一点。

2667
01:40:38,458 --> 01:40:40,833
- 我们要先数这个。
- 现在，切诺基。

2668
01:40:41,833 --> 01:40:45,333
或者你的老板会很快抽到 35,000 美元。

2669
01:41:13,333 --> 01:41:14,333
好的。

2670
01:41:16,291 --> 01:41:18,041
解开这匹马，让玛丽可以骑出去。

2671
01:41:29,583 --> 01:41:32,303
- 你总是动作这么慢？
- 你总是说这么多？

2672
01:41:45,666 --> 01:41:46,666
真的吗？

2673
01:41:48,500 --> 01:41:49,625
在后面？

2674
01:41:53,416 --> 01:41:54,875
你怎么看，贝克沃斯？

2675
01:41:56,458 --> 01:41:58,000
不，他不会那样做

2676
01:41:58,583 --> 01:42:01,333
因为那样我就得往他的颅骨里放一颗子弹。

2677
01:42:01,416 --> 01:42:04,250
我们永远不会知道现在谁是最快的，对吗？

2678
01:42:09,333 --> 01:42:11,166
我得把它交给你，男孩。

2679
01:42:11,250 --> 01:42:13,833
你知道如何做一个盛大的入口。

2680
01:42:14,958 --> 01:42:16,958
该死，我什至没有排练那个。

2681
01:42:19,541 --> 01:42:21,083
你知道，快速绘制，

2682
01:42:22,083 --> 01:42:23,708
Nat Love 是一个行走的死人。

2683
01:42:25,750 --> 01:42:27,000
但你不必如此。

2684
01:42:27,500 --> 01:42:29,500
你为什么不骑上你的马，拉屎，然后回到你称之为家的地方？

2685
01:42:29,583 --> 01:42:31,583


2686
01:42:33,333 --> 01:42:34,833
你知道那是不可能的。

2687
01:42:43,750 --> 01:42:45,125
从五开始倒数？

2688
01:42:55,791 --> 01:42:56,791
五...

2689
01:43:14,458 --> 01:43:15,458
四...

2690
01:43:29,458 --> 01:43:30,291
三...

2691
01:43:37,916 --> 01:43:41,083
为什么他们总是要数得这么慢？

2692
01:43:41,166 --> 01:43:43,458
吉姆！

2693
01:43:59,541 --> 01:44:01,083

2728
01:51:59,875 --> 01:52:01,041

鲁弗斯，我别无选择……

2731
01:53:26,708 --> 01:53:28,208
我告诉了那个孩子。

2732
01:53:29,541 --> 01:53:31,500
他们该死的把戏...

2733
01:53:52,541 --> 01:53:54,501
对不起，女士们。

2734
01:53:56,083 --> 01:53:58,291
- 你没事吧，库菲？
- 只需要重新加载。

2735
01:53:59,250 --> 01:54:00,333
你看起来很受伤，皮克特先生。

2736
01:54:00,416 --> 01:54:03,916
只是皮肉伤口而已。 玛姬今天还没准备好迎接我。

2737
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:05,125
嗯？

2738
01:54:05,708 --> 01:54:06,833
什么鬼？

2739
01:54:11,041 --> 01:54:12,375
我会被诅咒的。

现在，为什么你的脸上有那种表情？

2742

不，不，不，不，兄弟，不，不，不。

停下。 不要那样做。

2744
01:54:40,291 --> 01:54:41,708

2746

害怕只会在来世给你带来恶业。

2747

2748

01:58:17,500 --> 01:58:18,666
拿起你的枪。

2767
01:58:20,791 --> 01:58:22,416
我知道现在是什么。

2768
01:58:24,416 --> 01:58:25,708
是眼睛。

2769
01:58:27,541 --> 01:58:28,625
把它们捡起来，我说。

2770
01:58:31,083 --> 01:58:32,166
你的父亲，

2771
01:58:34,458 --> 01:58:35,458
他是个好人吗？

2772
01:58:38,666 --> 01:58:39,666
他是。

2773
01:58:42,333 --> 01:58:45,666
在你砍掉他们之前，我妈妈是个好女人。

2774
01:58:47,708 --> 01:58:50,000
看来我们的成长经历不同。

2775
01:58:52,166 --> 01:58:53,791
我不在乎你是如何长大的。

2776
01:58:55,333 --> 01:58:57,541
现在拿起你的枪转身。

2777
01:59:00,750 --> 01:59:03,375
我过去常常看着我父亲把他的食物煮过头，把我妈妈打得一塌糊涂。

2778
01:59:03,458 --> 01:59:05,208


2779
01:59:06,083 --> 01:59:08,708
如果她也没有煮熟，他就把她切得很好。

2780
01:59:13,041 --> 01:59:15,708
有一天，我决定介入，

2781
01:59:17,458 --> 01:59:19,166
他向我发怒。

2782
01:59:23,541 --> 01:59:25,916
我父亲不是一个好人。

2783
01:59:28,083 --> 01:59:29,958
不是一个好人。 他是个不法分子。

2784
01:59:31,750 --> 01:59:33,041
罗宾银行...

2785
01:59:35,583 --> 01:59:36,750
他喜欢喝酒。

2786
01:59:43,416 --> 01:59:46,583
我妈妈拿了一个瓶子，切了他来保护我。

2787
01:59:49,625 --> 01:59:53,041
他回击她，就这样，她走了。

2788
01:59:56,333 --> 01:59:59,625
然后，就像他是个胆小鬼一样，

2789
02:00:01,000 --> 02:00:03,208
他带走了我们所有的东西然后离开了

2790
02:00:05,250 --> 02:00:06,791
离开我和我的...

2791
02:00:08,875 --> 02:00:09,875
我的母亲。

2792
02:00:15,750 --> 02:00:17,583
我才十岁，你知道...

2793
02:00:19,916 --> 02:00:21,833
和你差不多年纪...

2794
02:00:25,041 --> 02:00:26,500
当我给你那个伤疤的时候。

2795
02:00:29,666 --> 02:00:33,041
我不得不照顾自己，但我变成了现在的我，

2796
02:00:34,333 --> 02:00:35,375
就像你一样。

2797
02:00:41,166 --> 02:00:46,375
就像我所做的那样，我所能想到的就是希望我父亲为他所做的事情付出代价。

2798
02:00:48,583 --> 02:00:52,833
我找了他很多年，一直找不到。

2799
02:00:55,625 --> 02:00:58,125
就好像他从地球上消失了一样。

2800
02:01:00,166 --> 02:01:03,416
我并没有停下来。 我一直在找...

2801
02:01:07,208 --> 02:01:08,916
直到我找到了他。

2802
02:01:13,500 --> 02:01:14,541
一天...

2803
02:01:19,666 --> 02:01:21,000
瞧，

2804
02:01:22,916 --> 02:01:24,333
他在那里，

2805
02:01:25,125 --> 02:01:26,125
我的父亲，

2806
02:01:27,375 --> 02:01:28,458
一个新人。

2807
02:01:29,833 --> 02:01:31,291
他现在很干净。

2808
02:01:33,333 --> 02:01:34,333
清醒。

2809
02:01:37,291 --> 02:01:38,375
神之人。

2810
02:01:43,375 --> 02:01:44,625
有一个教堂。

2811
02:01:45,916 --> 02:01:47,750
他有一个漂亮的小妻子。

2812
02:01:51,708 --> 02:01:53,125
他还有一个儿子，

2813
02:01:55,166 --> 02:01:57,208
十岁左右，

2814
02:01:59,083 --> 02:02:01,125
他的眼睛像我一样闪耀。

2815
02:02:02,583 --> 02:02:03,583
你在说谎。

2816
02:02:04,500 --> 02:02:05,916
你在说谎！

2817
02:02:11,500 --> 02:02:13,541
杀了我们的父亲是报应，但是……

2818
02:02:13,625 --> 02:02:14,791
<i>我的</i>父亲！

2819
02:02:16,875 --> 02:02:17,875
<i>我的</i>妈妈！

2820
02:02:20,583 --> 02:02:21,791
但这还不够。

2821
02:02:23,625 --> 02:02:24,750
让你活着，

2822
02:02:25,583 --> 02:02:27,291
这才是真正的报复。

2823
02:02:29,833 --> 02:02:34,250
你犯下的每一个罪，你抢劫的每一家银行，你杀死的每一个人。

2824
02:02:35,291 --> 02:02:36,625
我的意思是，看着你。

2825
02:02:37,833 --> 02:02:40,208
你他试图逃避的一切。

2826
02:02:42,333 --> 02:02:43,333
巴克。

2827
02:02:47,083 --> 02:02:48,583
把他的名字改成了“爱”。

2828
02:02:53,750 --> 02:02:54,750
你一个巴克。

2829
02:02:55,625 --> 02:02:56,625
你在说谎。

2830
02:02:57,500 --> 02:02:58,583
就像我。

2831
02:03:00,041 --> 02:03:01,208
就像他一样。

2832
02:03:03,208 --> 02:03:06,666
但你更好。 你甚至会超过我，因为...

2833
02:03:09,083 --> 02:03:10,458
我不能杀死我的兄弟。

2834
02:03:12,166 --> 02:03:14,541
然而在这里你要杀死你的人。

2835
02:03:15,958 --> 02:03:19,083
是时候报仇了，纳撒尼尔·巴克。

2836
02:03:24,125 --> 02:03:25,166
继续。

2837
02:03:29,958 --> 02:03:31,416
- 纳撒尼尔巴克。
- 不。

2838
02:03:35,958 --> 02:03:37,166
报仇雪恨。

2839
02:03:40,208 --> 02:03:41,416
纳撒尼尔·巴克。

2840
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:43,958
报仇雪恨吧！

2841
02:03:46,500 --> 02:03:47,791
你一个巴克。

2842
02:03:50,333 --> 02:03:52,125
纳撒尼尔·巴克。

2843
02:03:55,833 --> 02:03:57,083
