1
00:00:39,281 --> 00:00:40,537
<i>So you're asking her tonight?</i>

2
00:00:40,672 --> 00:00:42,342
Yeah. Any advice?

3
00:00:42,478 --> 00:00:43,942
Go for the grand gesture.

4
00:00:44,077 --> 00:00:46,446
I used to do stuff like that
all the time.

5
00:00:46,581 --> 00:00:47,822
He never did anything like that.

6
00:00:47,846 --> 00:00:49,154
It was totally out of character.

7
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:50,619
40,000. Do I have 45?

8
00:00:50,754 --> 00:00:53,852
Actually,
David's proposal was probably

9
00:00:53,987 --> 00:00:56,120
the only time
he ever surprised me.

10
00:00:56,256 --> 00:00:58,123
We dated all four years
she was in college.

11
00:00:58,259 --> 00:01:00,379
I had a spot in the master's
program for architecture,

12
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:02,893
so I was definitely staying
in Chicago.

13
00:01:03,029 --> 00:01:04,568
Then out of nowhere,
I get an offer

14
00:01:04,704 --> 00:01:06,838
from a great gallery in L.A.
70,000?

15
00:01:06,973 --> 00:01:09,174
- 70.
- 70,000.

16
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:10,737
So, the night before
graduation...

17
00:01:10,873 --> 00:01:12,639
and she springs it on me
she's leaving.

18
00:01:12,775 --> 00:01:15,048
And I'm calm.
You know, happy for her.

19
00:01:15,184 --> 00:01:17,250
<i>He freaks out completely.</i>

20
00:01:18,287 --> 00:01:21,178
So, the next morning,
at the ceremony,

21
00:01:21,313 --> 00:01:24,418
I'm up there walking towards
the dean and my diploma,

22
00:01:24,553 --> 00:01:27,886
and suddenly, there's David,

23
00:01:28,021 --> 00:01:30,324
right next to me,
down on one knee.

24
00:01:30,459 --> 00:01:32,523
And she starts crying.

25
00:01:32,659 --> 00:01:34,899
I'm so embarrassed.

26
00:01:35,035 --> 00:01:36,234
The whole place erupts.

27
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:37,931
Everybody's clapping
and shouting.

28
00:01:38,066 --> 00:01:40,066
Except her parents.
They thought she was too young.

29
00:01:40,174 --> 00:01:41,504
They thought I could do better.

30
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:44,238
But who ever listens
to their parents?

31
00:01:44,374 --> 00:01:46,213
Sold to Georgia Cotton.

32
00:01:48,373 --> 00:01:51,615
Long story short,
she didn't move to California,

33
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:53,711
and a month later,
we were pregnant with Lily.

34
00:01:53,847 --> 00:01:55,117
That's amazing.

35
00:01:55,253 --> 00:01:56,514
Wait, how long ago?

36
00:01:56,650 --> 00:01:59,453
Uh, let me do the math.

37
00:01:59,589 --> 00:02:02,524
March 7th, it'll be 25 years.

38
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:04,623
Incredible.
25 years of marriage.

39
00:02:04,758 --> 00:02:06,931
Oh, God. We're not married.

40
00:02:07,066 --> 00:02:08,862
God, no.

41
00:02:08,997 --> 00:02:11,469
We divorced five years later.

42
00:02:11,605 --> 00:02:13,640
And it's not one of those
amicable divorces

43
00:02:13,776 --> 00:02:15,442
you see on TV.

44
00:02:15,578 --> 00:02:17,738
I try not to be in the same
time zone if I can help it,

45
00:02:17,775 --> 00:02:19,979
but Lily's graduating tomorrow,
so here I am.

46
00:02:20,115 --> 00:02:21,573
Wow, that's got to be awkward.

47
00:02:21,709 --> 00:02:23,476
What? No. Ancient history.

48
00:02:23,612 --> 00:02:24,775
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

49
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:26,785
Nightmare.

50
00:02:26,921 --> 00:02:28,552
Check, please.

51
00:02:32,587 --> 00:02:34,217
What are you doing?

52
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:37,162
- I'm packing.
- You're packing work.

53
00:02:37,297 --> 00:02:38,589
Don't pack work.

54
00:02:38,725 --> 00:02:39,999
Why would you pack work?

55
00:02:40,135 --> 00:02:41,295
Because it's a short vacation

56
00:02:41,399 --> 00:02:42,676
and a very long life afterwards.

57
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:43,907
Yeah, I've been thinking
about that,

58
00:02:43,931 --> 00:02:45,338
and I really don't think
this whole

59
00:02:45,474 --> 00:02:47,354
"being an adult" thing
is gonna work out for me.

60
00:02:49,072 --> 00:02:52,107
Yeah, well,
I don't really have a choice.

61
00:02:52,242 --> 00:02:53,310
Hey, Mom.

62
00:02:53,445 --> 00:02:55,281
So I'm just steaming my outfit,

63
00:02:55,416 --> 00:02:57,447
and I am wondering
where I'm sitting.

64
00:02:57,583 --> 00:02:59,749
Not that it matters.
To me, I mean.

65
00:02:59,884 --> 00:03:01,780
Just... I mean, it doesn't
matter to me at all.

66
00:03:01,915 --> 00:03:03,189
Then why did you...

67
00:03:03,324 --> 00:03:05,292
Oh, hang on. It's Dad.

68
00:03:06,822 --> 00:03:08,955
Hey, Dad.
Mom's on the other line.

69
00:03:09,091 --> 00:03:10,790
Don't say hi from me.

70
00:03:10,926 --> 00:03:12,364
You're not sitting together,
okay?

71
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:14,070
You're on opposite sides
of the auditorium,

72
00:03:14,094 --> 00:03:15,528
which is the size
of Rhode Island.

73
00:03:15,664 --> 00:03:17,165
That's the smallest state.

74
00:03:18,499 --> 00:03:20,198
So you promise?

75
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:24,202
No mean comments, no arguing,
no passive aggression?

76
00:03:24,337 --> 00:03:26,809
What about aggressive
aggression? Is that okay?

77
00:03:26,944 --> 00:03:29,580
I love you.
I love you.

78
00:03:30,617 --> 00:03:32,981
This is gonna be
an unbearable day.

79
00:03:33,117 --> 00:03:34,553
Come on.

80
00:03:34,688 --> 00:03:36,880
We shake an old guy's hand
and wear a dumb hat.

81
00:03:37,016 --> 00:03:39,618
What could possibly go wrong?

82
00:03:39,754 --> 00:03:41,718
They're sitting together.

83
00:03:46,362 --> 00:03:47,530
Good afternoon.

84
00:03:47,666 --> 00:03:49,361
Excuse me.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

85
00:03:49,496 --> 00:03:52,839
On behalf of the faculty and
staff of Pullman University...

86
00:03:52,975 --> 00:03:54,407
- Big day.
- Yeah.

87
00:03:54,542 --> 00:03:57,036
It is my privilege
to welcome the parents,

88
00:03:57,172 --> 00:04:00,078
family and friends
of our graduating seniors.

89
00:04:00,214 --> 00:04:01,882
You got to be kidding me.

90
00:04:02,017 --> 00:04:03,407
Guess this is my seat,

91
00:04:03,542 --> 00:04:05,814
as you haven't had a date
since Lily was in braces.

92
00:04:05,949 --> 00:04:07,883
At least when I do date,
it's age-appropriate.

93
00:04:08,019 --> 00:04:11,154
You just don't
like him because he's French.

94
00:04:11,289 --> 00:04:12,718
I like the French.

95
00:04:12,853 --> 00:04:14,257
I like their fries, their toast.

96
00:04:14,393 --> 00:04:15,691
I specifically asked Lily

97
00:04:15,827 --> 00:04:17,299
- not to seat us together.
- Their mustard.

98
00:04:17,323 --> 00:04:18,607
What? You called her?
That's so pathetic.

99
00:04:18,631 --> 00:04:19,935
- Shh. It's starting.
- Don't shush me.

100
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:21,501
- Shh.
- Don't shush me.

101
00:04:21,636 --> 00:04:25,699
So, without further ado,
let's begin the roll call.

102
00:04:25,834 --> 00:04:28,036
Wren Butler.

103
00:04:28,172 --> 00:04:29,838
Yes!

104
00:04:30,878 --> 00:04:32,808
Wrenny!

105
00:04:37,215 --> 00:04:38,781
Excuse me.

106
00:04:38,916 --> 00:04:40,920
- That's my armrest.
- No, it's in the middle.

107
00:04:41,056 --> 00:04:42,389
Oh, this is so like you.

108
00:04:42,524 --> 00:04:44,029
- Take, take, take.
- It is not a metaphor.

109
00:04:44,053 --> 00:04:45,524
It is an armrest.
Wilson Chang.

110
00:04:45,659 --> 00:04:47,861
Give me half, please.
I would like half.

111
00:04:49,756 --> 00:04:51,056
Just give me half.

112
00:04:51,192 --> 00:04:52,475
What is wrong with you?
I just want half!

113
00:04:52,499 --> 00:04:54,592
Lily Cotton.
Oh. Hey.

114
00:04:57,901 --> 00:04:59,421
- Take a picture.
- You take a picture.

115
00:04:59,531 --> 00:05:01,243
- I'm in the moment.
- Why do you need a picture?

116
00:05:01,267 --> 00:05:03,135
- So I don't forget the moment.
- Ah.

117
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:04,538
Love you.
Love you more.

118
00:05:04,674 --> 00:05:06,303
- So proud.
- Prouder.

119
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:07,881
The most proud.
Proudest.

120
00:05:08,017 --> 00:05:09,277
Couldn't be more proud.

121
00:05:09,412 --> 00:05:10,713
Bursting.

122
00:05:10,849 --> 00:05:12,978
She got my nose.
Yeah. Yeah.

123
00:05:13,114 --> 00:05:15,213
You're welcome, honey.
Love you, Lily.

124
00:05:16,855 --> 00:05:18,550
I can't believe
my baby's a lawyer.

125
00:05:18,685 --> 00:05:20,117
You and me both.

126
00:05:20,253 --> 00:05:21,756
Can everyone
please stop shouting?

127
00:05:21,892 --> 00:05:23,928
- Who's shouting?
- There you go again.

128
00:05:24,063 --> 00:05:26,999
Some of us maybe had seven
too many Jägerbombs last night.

129
00:05:27,134 --> 00:05:28,563
Just one too many.

130
00:05:28,699 --> 00:05:31,061
The other six were perfection.

131
00:05:31,196 --> 00:05:33,132
Well, it's a long flight
to Bali.

132
00:05:33,267 --> 00:05:35,735
You can sleep on the plane.

133
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:38,069
Lily can work on the plane.

134
00:05:38,205 --> 00:05:39,474
She had at least 90 hours

135
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:41,171
of exams in the last week.

136
00:05:41,306 --> 00:05:42,812
Well, in the next three months,

137
00:05:42,947 --> 00:05:44,748
she starts at the top
law firm in Chicago.

138
00:05:44,883 --> 00:05:47,478
You can't show up to a gunfight
with a tan.

139
00:05:47,614 --> 00:05:49,854
Okay, she needs to decompress,
and you need to calm down.

140
00:05:49,986 --> 00:05:51,457
You know telling someone
to calm down

141
00:05:51,593 --> 00:05:53,160
has literally never
calmed anyone down

142
00:05:53,295 --> 00:05:54,535
in the history of the universe?

143
00:05:54,626 --> 00:05:56,161
- I know that.
- You know that?

144
00:05:56,296 --> 00:05:57,491
Inside voices, please.

145
00:05:57,626 --> 00:05:58,925
I'm taking briefs.

146
00:05:59,061 --> 00:06:00,797
I'm taking sunblock.
I'll be fine.

147
00:06:00,932 --> 00:06:02,632
You know, for once,
you could back me up.

148
00:06:02,768 --> 00:06:04,498
I could, but then
I'd be wrong, too.

149
00:06:04,634 --> 00:06:06,166
Ugh. Okay, we should go.

150
00:06:06,302 --> 00:06:08,262
Oh. Do you see what you did?
You blew the goodbye.

151
00:06:08,309 --> 00:06:09,338
- I did that?
- Uh-huh.

152
00:06:09,474 --> 00:06:11,443
It wasn't just him. Bye.

153
00:06:11,579 --> 00:06:13,707
- See, it wasn't just me.
- I love you.

154
00:06:13,842 --> 00:06:15,439
- Hey. Bye.
- Bye, Dad.

155
00:06:15,575 --> 00:06:17,335
DAVID and-Bye, bye,
bye, bye, bye, bye, bye.

156
00:06:18,417 --> 00:06:20,048
Bye, Lily's dad and mom.

157
00:06:20,183 --> 00:06:22,984
'Cause my dad and mom
don't even know I'm going.

158
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:25,354
I love you. Be safe.

159
00:06:25,489 --> 00:06:26,550
Make good choices.

160
00:06:26,686 --> 00:06:28,294
Always.

161
00:06:28,429 --> 00:06:30,464

See you again never.

164
00:06:35,665 --> 00:06:37,330
Hopefully not that soon.

This place is incredible.

176
00:07:19,478 --> 00:07:21,575
I say we just move here.

177
00:07:21,711 --> 00:07:23,874
I'd need more sunblock.

178
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:25,880
I say we think about it.

179
00:07:26,016 --> 00:07:27,381
I say we really,
seriously just...

180
00:07:27,516 --> 00:07:28,780
Wait.

181
00:07:28,915 --> 00:07:31,184
Where's the boat?

182
00:07:33,394 --> 00:07:35,720
Oh, shit. They forgot us.

183
00:07:35,855 --> 00:07:37,359
Uh, no, no, no.

184
00:07:37,494 --> 00:07:38,724
It's fine.

185
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:40,233
We're good swimmers.

186
00:07:40,369 --> 00:07:42,431
How far do you think that is?

187
00:07:42,566 --> 00:07:44,366
A mile?

188
00:07:44,501 --> 00:07:46,439
A hundred miles?

189
00:07:46,575 --> 00:07:48,471
- Who can ever really tell?
- Okay.

190
00:07:48,606 --> 00:07:51,207
Uh, let's go. Come on.

191
00:07:51,342 --> 00:07:53,008
Okay.

192
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:56,914
- Lily?
- What?

193
00:07:57,049 --> 00:07:59,716
If we don't make it,
I love you like a sister.

194
00:07:59,852 --> 00:08:01,415
Don't talk.
Conserve your energy.

195
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:03,618
Okay.

196
00:08:03,753 --> 00:08:05,315
You hate your sister.

197
00:08:05,451 --> 00:08:07,823
Yeah. I love you
like how a person

198
00:08:07,959 --> 00:08:09,563
is supposed to love
their sister,

199
00:08:09,698 --> 00:08:12,192
like, if their sister wasn't
a total bitch.

200
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,629
Hey! Hey!

201
00:08:14,765 --> 00:08:16,094
- Hey!
- Over here!

202
00:08:16,229 --> 00:08:17,568
- Help us!
- It's us! Hey!

203
00:08:17,703 --> 00:08:18,996
- Come over here!
- Over here!

204
00:08:19,132 --> 00:08:20,805
- Hello? Hey!
- Help!

205
00:08:21,771 --> 00:08:24,545
See? It's gonna be okay.

206
00:08:26,614 --> 00:08:29,275
All I see is one
superhot boat guy.

207
00:08:35,888 --> 00:08:37,783
You're a long way out
for a swim.

208
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:40,491
The boat forgot us.

209
00:08:40,626 --> 00:08:42,755
How could they forget about you?

210
00:08:42,891 --> 00:08:45,159
That's what I'm saying.

211
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:48,433
Careful.

212
00:08:48,569 --> 00:08:50,861
Got you. I got you.

213
00:08:50,996 --> 00:08:52,697
You okay?

214
00:08:52,832 --> 00:08:54,773
Yeah.

215
00:08:56,507 --> 00:08:58,172
I'm Lily.

216
00:08:59,447 --> 00:09:01,377
Well, pleased to meet you, Lily.

00:09:01,512 --> 00:09:03,111

218
00:09:06,186 --> 00:09:07,879

So, what do you do when you're
not swimming for your life?

229
00:09:32,445 --> 00:09:34,371
I'm a lawyer.

230
00:09:34,507 --> 00:09:36,340
- Oh.
- I will be when I get home.

231
00:09:36,475 --> 00:09:38,711
- I just graduated from college.
- Here.

232
00:09:38,846 --> 00:09:41,087
That's exciting.

233
00:09:41,222 --> 00:09:42,715
You think?

234
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:44,687
Don't you?

235
00:09:44,822 --> 00:09:47,386
Uh, I don't know. I just...

236
00:09:47,522 --> 00:09:49,402
I mean, my whole life,
I've been working towards

237
00:09:49,524 --> 00:09:53,094
this, like, far-off thing
on the horizon, and...

238
00:09:53,229 --> 00:09:54,930
now that I've finally
gotten there,

239
00:09:55,065 --> 00:09:57,601
I can't help but wonder
if I've...

240
00:09:57,737 --> 00:10:00,201
had the plan wrong all along.

241
00:10:02,207 --> 00:10:04,271
I don't know, but it's-it's...
it's too late.

242
00:10:04,406 --> 00:10:07,347
You know, I-I can't not do it,
you know?

243
00:10:07,482 --> 00:10:09,349
I can't let everybody down.

244
00:10:09,485 --> 00:10:11,509
Who would you be letting down?

245
00:10:12,686 --> 00:10:16,184
Well, uh, my parents, for one.

246
00:10:17,522 --> 00:10:19,319
Who else?

247
00:10:20,418 --> 00:10:22,359
Uh, well, I guess just them.

248
00:10:23,926 --> 00:10:25,297
I mean, what about you?

249
00:10:25,432 --> 00:10:26,563
What's your story?

250
00:10:26,698 --> 00:10:28,301
I'm a seaweed farmer.

251
00:10:28,436 --> 00:10:30,902
What?

252
00:10:31,037 --> 00:10:33,136
That's a sentence
I haven't heard a lot.

253
00:10:33,271 --> 00:10:35,708
Well, you've been spending time
with the wrong people.

254
00:10:35,843 --> 00:10:38,069
Uh, my father was
a seaweed farmer,

255
00:10:38,204 --> 00:10:40,108
his father before him.

256
00:10:40,243 --> 00:10:45,075
And what about
his father before him?

257
00:10:45,211 --> 00:10:46,543
He was a fisherman.

258
00:10:46,678 --> 00:10:48,385
- Uh-huh.
- They can't all be winners.

259
00:10:54,257 --> 00:10:56,356
Why are you looking
at me like that?

260
00:10:58,695 --> 00:11:00,232
I'm sorry.

261
00:11:00,368 --> 00:11:01,927
I just, um...

262
00:11:02,063 --> 00:11:04,738
I have this crazy...

263
00:11:04,873 --> 00:11:07,139
I just really want
to kiss you right now.

264
00:11:07,274 --> 00:11:10,601
But don't worry. I won't just,
like, you know, suddenly...

00:12:36,364 --> 00:12:38,799
Oh. Okay.

270
00:12:46,235 --> 00:12:48,237
You been out here for a while?

271
00:12:49,303 --> 00:12:50,877
The floor isn't that comfy.

272
00:12:56,149 --> 00:12:58,408
I wish I went to work
in a bathing suit.

273
00:12:58,543 --> 00:13:00,683
This isn't work.

274
00:13:00,819 --> 00:13:02,513
It's a partnership.

275
00:13:02,649 --> 00:13:05,925
With Dewi Danu,
the goddess of the sea.

276
00:13:09,163 --> 00:13:12,591
All we have to do is understand
her tides and moods...

277
00:13:14,432 --> 00:13:18,705
not throw plastic into her,
not over-farm her,

278
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:21,539
and she'll give us
wonderful lives.

279
00:13:21,675 --> 00:13:23,668
Nature, god and people.

280
00:13:25,046 --> 00:13:27,606
Balance the three,
and you have harmony.

281
00:13:33,522 --> 00:13:36,087
I am so out of balance.

282
00:13:38,516 --> 00:13:40,392
You can find it here.

283
00:14:00,916 --> 00:14:02,411
<i>It's a savage commentary</i>

284

285
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:07,411
But look closer,
and you'll divine

286
00:14:07,546 --> 00:14:09,346
a fundamental compassion that...

287
00:14:09,482 --> 00:14:11,386
I think it's upside down.

288
00:14:12,389 --> 00:14:13,894
Really?

289
00:14:16,093 --> 00:14:17,722
Would you excuse me, please?

290
00:14:19,464 --> 00:14:21,800
I'm working, David.
I really don't have time.

291
00:14:21,935 --> 00:14:23,363
Unless you became an oncologist

292
00:14:23,499 --> 00:14:25,268
since we last spoke,
you got time.

293
00:14:25,403 --> 00:14:27,532
There you go, always
diminishing what I do.

294
00:14:27,668 --> 00:14:30,007
What you do
diminishes what you do.

295
00:14:30,142 --> 00:14:31,843
- Check your email.
- I do check it.

296
00:14:31,979 --> 00:14:33,846
- You're blocked.
- Lily wrote us.

297
00:14:33,982 --> 00:14:35,982
Whatever this is,
it's your fault.

298
00:14:39,421 --> 00:14:40,980
She what?

299
00:14:46,085 --> 00:14:47,993
This is East Atlantic flight 576

300
00:14:48,129 --> 00:14:50,058
with continuing service
to Denpasar, Bali.

301
00:14:50,194 --> 00:14:51,790
Thanks for everyone's patience

302
00:14:51,925 --> 00:14:53,831
as we welcome aboard
our Los Angeles passengers.

303
00:14:53,967 --> 00:14:55,459
Can I get you some champagne?

304
00:14:55,594 --> 00:14:58,196
- Hmm.
- Two, please.

305
00:14:58,332 --> 00:15:00,870
I only drink when I fly.

306
00:15:01,005 --> 00:15:03,240
I'm Beth-Ann Flannery.

307
00:15:03,376 --> 00:15:06,179
I like to befriend my seatmates
in case we crash

308
00:15:06,315 --> 00:15:09,572
so they're more inclined
to pull me from the wreckage.

309
00:15:09,707 --> 00:15:11,847
I have two children and a dog...

310
00:15:16,315 --> 00:15:17,988
Okay? Okay.

311
00:15:18,123 --> 00:15:19,353
Excuse me, ma'am.

312
00:15:19,489 --> 00:15:20,992
I think your things
are in my seat.

313
00:15:21,128 --> 00:15:22,923
BETH... Oh, sorry.

314
00:15:23,058 --> 00:15:24,488
Oh, come on.

315
00:15:24,623 --> 00:15:26,026
You've got to be kidding me.

316
00:15:26,161 --> 00:15:27,825
You speak English.

317
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:30,494
Oh, you're still doing
the Italian tourist bit?

318
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:32,265
Excuse me, ma'am?

319
00:15:32,401 --> 00:15:33,937
I need to sit somewhere else.

320
00:15:34,073 --> 00:15:35,773
I'm sorry. It's a full flight.

321
00:15:35,908 --> 00:15:36,908
We used to be married.

322
00:15:37,010 --> 00:15:38,337
The worst 19 years of my life.

323
00:15:38,473 --> 00:15:39,673
We were only married for five.

324
00:15:39,704 --> 00:15:40,942
I'm counting the recovery.

325
00:15:41,077 --> 00:15:42,443
I can't sit there.

326
00:15:42,579 --> 00:15:44,644
There's nothing I can do.
Well...

327
00:15:45,644 --> 00:15:47,414
I'll swap with you, dear.

328
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:49,889
Just remember, in case we go down.
Oh.

329
00:15:50,024 --> 00:15:52,454
BETH... Mm, you-you owe me one.

330
00:15:52,589 --> 00:15:54,397
Thank you. -I told you
I was gonna go get her.

331
00:15:54,421 --> 00:15:55,853
In four days' time...

332
00:15:55,989 --> 00:15:57,731
Our daughter's gonna marry
a guy she just met

333
00:15:57,755 --> 00:15:59,295
millions of miles from home.

334
00:15:59,430 --> 00:16:00,990
Excuse me, did the middle
of my sentence

335
00:16:01,068 --> 00:16:02,348
interrupt the beginning
of yours?

336
00:16:02,431 --> 00:16:03,539
She's throwing her career away.

337
00:16:03,563 --> 00:16:04,961
Just like her mother did.

338
00:16:05,097 --> 00:16:06,712
Which is why I'm
the only one that can stop her.

339
00:16:06,736 --> 00:16:08,315
- She doesn't listen to him.
- She listens to me.

340
00:16:08,339 --> 00:16:09,387
Oh, did she respond
to your email?

341
00:16:09,411 --> 00:16:10,609
Yes.

342
00:16:10,744 --> 00:16:12,276
And there she is.

343
00:16:14,346 --> 00:16:15,810
Oh, my God. Paul.

344
00:16:15,945 --> 00:16:17,247
Paul?

345
00:16:17,383 --> 00:16:18,896
- I know you love a surprise.
- Oh, uh...

346
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:20,046
I know you do.

347
00:16:20,182 --> 00:16:21,578
Mm, mm, mm...

348
00:16:21,713 --> 00:16:23,623
Looks like someone upgraded.

349
00:16:23,758 --> 00:16:25,190
She hates a surprise.

350
00:16:26,224 --> 00:16:28,094
David. What are you doing here?

351
00:16:28,229 --> 00:16:30,123
I'm flying to Bali.
What are you doing here?

352
00:16:30,259 --> 00:16:31,590
I'm flying you to Bali.

353
00:16:31,726 --> 00:16:33,999
- I couldn't let her go alone.
- Ah.

354
00:16:34,134 --> 00:16:35,995
So I traded flights
with a friend.

355
00:16:36,130 --> 00:16:39,004
Got to captain three long hauls
to Uruguay next month, but...

356
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:41,334
the things you do
for love, right?

357
00:16:41,469 --> 00:16:43,406
- It's so sweet.
- I know.

358
00:16:46,473 --> 00:16:48,341
- Mm.
- So sweet.

359
00:16:48,477 --> 00:16:50,072
Mm.

360
00:16:51,075 --> 00:16:53,118
Ah. Ah,<i> oui.</i> Me, too.

361
00:16:53,254 --> 00:16:55,420
GEORGIA and-Mm, mm, mm, mm, mm,

362
00:16:55,556 --> 00:16:57,347
mm, mm.

363
00:17:02,493 --> 00:17:04,162
Oh, my. Those eyes.

364
00:17:04,297 --> 00:17:05,856
Hmm. Couldn't you just
swim in them?

365
00:17:05,991 --> 00:17:08,100
They're blue. Big deal.
So are my socks.

366
00:17:08,235 --> 00:17:10,764
And Frenchmen make
such great lovers.

367
00:17:10,899 --> 00:17:12,864
That's a rumor they started
about themselves.

368
00:17:12,999 --> 00:17:14,297
Oh, keep telling yourself that.

369
00:17:14,432 --> 00:17:15,432
Ha-ha.

370
00:17:15,501 --> 00:17:17,136
Oh! Champagne.

371
00:17:17,271 --> 00:17:18,601
Oh. Two, please.

372
00:17:18,736 --> 00:17:19,974
Just leave the bottle.

373
00:17:20,109 --> 00:17:21,444
Thank you.

374
00:17:23,614 --> 00:17:25,316
<i>Baby, I don't think that him</i>

375
00:17:25,452 --> 00:17:27,127
tagging along on your trip
is going to help.

376
00:17:27,151 --> 00:17:28,616
Well, that's a hot take.

377
00:17:28,751 --> 00:17:30,311
The last time David
was actually helpful

378
00:17:30,353 --> 00:17:31,818
was the night we made Lily.

379
00:17:31,953 --> 00:17:34,660
There's an image
I'm not crazy about.

380
00:17:34,796 --> 00:17:36,562
Mm. You live, you learn.

381
00:17:36,697 --> 00:17:38,098
You upgrade.

382
00:17:40,027 --> 00:17:42,696
Aren't you supposed to be
flying the plane, Paul?

383
00:17:42,831 --> 00:17:44,637
At least not making out
with the passengers?

384
00:17:44,773 --> 00:17:46,172
Just this passenger.

385
00:17:46,307 --> 00:17:48,205
The only one that counts.
Mm.

386
00:17:48,341 --> 00:17:51,035
It's a totally foreign
concept to you,

387
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:53,312
but Paul puts me first.
He supports everything I do.

388
00:17:53,447 --> 00:17:55,187
That's because everything
she does is perfect.

389
00:17:55,211 --> 00:17:56,582
He's exaggerating.

390
00:17:56,717 --> 00:17:58,177
Is he? Are you?

391
00:17:58,312 --> 00:17:59,479
I'm really not.

392
00:17:59,614 --> 00:18:01,077
- Sure, you are.
- If you say so.

393
00:18:03,158 --> 00:18:05,754
Okay, it's just
a little turbulence.

394
00:18:05,889 --> 00:18:08,586
The plane is actually designed
to right itself in...

395
00:18:08,722 --> 00:18:10,658
Please go back to your seats.

396
00:18:15,195 --> 00:18:17,533
Oh, it's my house, my garden.

397
00:18:17,668 --> 00:18:19,172
My house.

398
00:18:19,307 --> 00:18:21,172
Why do I have so many pictures
of my house?

399
00:18:21,308 --> 00:18:23,275
Oh, there's Charlie.
He's my dog.

400
00:18:23,410 --> 00:18:26,102
Did I mention
he's very old and unwell?

401
00:18:26,237 --> 00:18:27,620
Beth-Ann, it's gonna
be all right, really.

402
00:18:27,644 --> 00:18:29,044
You're right.
It's going to be fine.

403
00:18:36,315 --> 00:18:38,922
These things happen,
of course, you know.

404
00:18:39,058 --> 00:18:40,357
Pilots aren't magicians.

405
00:18:40,493 --> 00:18:41,864
We-we only have
so much control up there.

406
00:18:41,888 --> 00:18:43,587
Oh, of course.
People understand that.

407
00:18:43,723 --> 00:18:45,095
You're the fucking worst!

408
00:18:45,231 --> 00:18:48,062
Nice try killing us, asshole!

409
00:18:49,065 --> 00:18:51,206
Maybe you should go, before
they get out the pitchforks.

410
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:53,211
I'll see you when you get
back here, okay? -Yeah.

411
00:18:53,235 --> 00:18:54,469
Okay.

412
00:18:54,605 --> 00:18:56,671
- I'll see you in four days.
- Yes.

413
00:19:01,741 --> 00:19:03,244
Don't blame yourself, Paul.

414
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:04,546
It could happen to anybody

415
00:19:04,681 --> 00:19:06,081
who doesn't know
what they're doing.

416
00:19:06,183 --> 00:19:07,447
Where's Lily?

417
00:19:07,582 --> 00:19:09,251
I thought you got her email.

418
00:19:09,387 --> 00:19:11,414
She's meeting us off the boat.

419
00:19:11,549 --> 00:19:13,120
What?

420
00:19:29,038 --> 00:19:31,308
This is the most incredible
place I've ever seen.

421
00:19:31,443 --> 00:19:32,945
You know what's incredible?

422
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:34,771
Hawaii, and it's in America.

423
00:19:34,906 --> 00:19:36,279
You've never been to Hawaii.

424
00:19:36,414 --> 00:19:37,654
You don't know where I've been.

425
00:19:37,747 --> 00:19:39,479
- You've never been to Hawaii.
- Ah.

426
00:19:39,614 --> 00:19:41,483
Okay. Let's talk game plan.

427
00:19:41,618 --> 00:19:43,255
As much as this
will pain us both,

428
00:19:43,391 --> 00:19:45,123
we have to call a truce
to make this work.

429
00:19:45,258 --> 00:19:46,466
Yes, we have to be in lockstep.

430
00:19:46,490 --> 00:19:47,819
- No meanness.
- No arguing.

431
00:19:47,954 --> 00:19:49,592
- We speak as one.
- Exactly right.

432
00:19:49,728 --> 00:19:52,056
- When do we start?
- Right after we see Lily.

433
00:19:54,064 --> 00:19:57,633
We tell her the wedding is off,
and we'll bring her home.

434
00:19:57,768 --> 00:19:59,328
Well, you know
whenever we say "don't"

435
00:19:59,404 --> 00:20:00,932
to Lily, she just hears "do."

436
00:20:01,068 --> 00:20:05,175
I say we go in
100% there for her in all ways,

437
00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:07,304
just supportive and loving,

438
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:10,612
and that's how we trick her
into dumping Mr. Seaweed.

439
00:20:10,748 --> 00:20:12,054
That's interesting.
Now, I'm thinking

440
00:20:12,078 --> 00:20:13,452
about a Trojan horse
sort of thing.

441
00:20:13,587 --> 00:20:15,291
We make her think we're okay
with the wedding,

442
00:20:15,315 --> 00:20:18,190
and then once we're in,
we get her to end it herself.

443
00:20:18,326 --> 00:20:19,987
That's literally
what I just said.

444
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:23,120
I don't remember anything
about a Trojan horse.

445
00:20:31,162 --> 00:20:32,700
Okay, so you got the plan?

446
00:20:32,836 --> 00:20:34,740
Of course I got
the plan. It's my plan.

447
00:20:34,875 --> 00:20:36,375
Thanks, fellas.

448
00:20:37,377 --> 00:20:39,868
Hey.

449
00:20:40,004 --> 00:20:41,375
- Oh! Hey, guys.
- Hey.

450
00:20:41,511 --> 00:20:43,674
- Hey. Hi.
- Hey, Dad.

451
00:20:43,810 --> 00:20:46,349
- Hi. Hey and hi.
- Hi.

452
00:20:46,484 --> 00:20:48,212
So, did you make a pact

453
00:20:48,347 --> 00:20:50,347
to not murder each other
until you murder me first?

454
00:20:50,382 --> 00:20:52,720
Oh, come on. Nobody is
murdering anybody. -No, no.

455
00:20:52,856 --> 00:20:54,717
I mean, of course,
we have some questions.

456
00:20:54,853 --> 00:20:56,259
We are your parents.

457
00:20:56,395 --> 00:20:57,823
We are here for you, my love.

458
00:20:57,959 --> 00:20:59,479
- Yes, we're in lockstep.
- Yes. Right.

459
00:20:59,566 --> 00:21:01,205
Okay, 'cause I've been
really freaked out about

460
00:21:01,229 --> 00:21:02,976
what you guys were gonna say...
Especially you, Dad.

461
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,381
I mean, you had a panic attack
when I pierced my ears.

462
00:21:04,405 --> 00:21:06,199
- Yes.
- Well, it's just about hygiene.

463
00:21:06,334 --> 00:21:08,735
And I know how much you wanted
the lawyer thing. It just...

464
00:21:08,871 --> 00:21:10,471
- Well...
- Uh, we-we just... we want you

465
00:21:10,541 --> 00:21:11,940
- to be happy, honey.
- Yeah.

466
00:21:13,643 --> 00:21:15,545
Wow. Okay.

467
00:21:15,681 --> 00:21:18,683
- That is such a relief.
- All right.

468
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:19,943
Wow.

469
00:21:20,078 --> 00:21:21,418
- Oh, Wrenny, hi.
- Hey, Wren.

470
00:21:21,554 --> 00:21:23,713
Don't mind me.
Just here for backup.

471
00:21:23,849 --> 00:21:24,849
We're all good now.

472
00:21:24,917 --> 00:21:26,225
You guys are gonna love it here,

473
00:21:26,361 --> 00:21:27,787
- and you'll love Gede.
- Love him.

474
00:21:27,923 --> 00:21:29,294
Gede? That's a nice name.

475
00:21:29,430 --> 00:21:31,089
- Really nice.
- Okay, please stop.

476
00:21:31,225 --> 00:21:33,597
Can't wait to hear
all about seaweed farming.

477
00:21:35,030 --> 00:21:37,568
Are you guys sure
you're good with this?

478
00:21:38,868 --> 00:21:41,133
'Cause you know
you could just tell me.

479
00:21:41,268 --> 00:21:44,104
You don't have to do a whole
Trojan horse thing.

480
00:21:44,239 --> 00:21:45,839
Wh-What... Why do...
What-what's...

481
00:21:45,941 --> 00:21:47,047
- What-what-what do you...
- A what?

482
00:21:47,071 --> 00:21:48,214
- What's that?
- Hmm?

483
00:21:48,349 --> 00:21:50,143
Didn't you tell me
that story, Mom?

484
00:21:50,279 --> 00:21:52,057
No, I told you. The Trojan
hor... I told you that story.

485
00:21:52,081 --> 00:21:53,691
- Oy. It doesn't matter.
- That was me. I-I did...

486
00:21:53,715 --> 00:21:54,715
Doesn't matter.

487
00:21:54,783 --> 00:21:56,822
We just are both here for you.

488
00:21:56,957 --> 00:21:58,721
Yeah. Lockstep.

489
00:22:20,037 --> 00:22:21,447
I don't see why

490
00:22:21,583 --> 00:22:23,506
we couldn't have gone
straight to the hotel.

491
00:22:23,641 --> 00:22:26,352
Yeah, well, you were supposed
to be here hours ago.

492
00:22:26,487 --> 00:22:28,454
- It wasn't his fault.
- Pilot error.

493
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:31,815
The engagement party
kind of starts now, so...

494
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:33,849
Who's gonna be there?

495
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:35,395
Just close family.

496
00:22:38,558 --> 00:22:39,964
Okay.

497
00:22:40,099 --> 00:22:41,526
Time for a walk.

498
00:22:41,661 --> 00:22:43,761
Wait, what?

499
00:22:43,897 --> 00:22:45,295
We get back on at the top.

500
00:22:45,431 --> 00:22:47,265
It just can't make it
with all these people.

501
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,265
Unbelievable.
I want my 4,000 whatevers back.

502
00:22:49,401 --> 00:22:52,137
You know that's like
a quarter, right?

503
00:22:56,513 --> 00:22:59,310
Mom, Dad, this is Gede.

504
00:22:59,445 --> 00:23:02,186
<i>Om swasti astu, Pa.
Om swasti astu, Me.</i>

505
00:23:02,322 --> 00:23:03,854
<i>Om swasti astu, Gede.</i>

506
00:23:03,990 --> 00:23:05,357
Hey.

507
00:23:05,493 --> 00:23:07,159
You learned that
to make me look bad.

508
00:23:07,295 --> 00:23:08,954
You don't need my help there.

509
00:23:09,090 --> 00:23:11,121
Uh, Mr. and Mrs. Cotton,
I welcome you

510
00:23:11,257 --> 00:23:12,896
to my country
and soon to my home.

511
00:23:13,032 --> 00:23:15,496
Mrs. Cotton is his mother.
You can just call me Georgia.

512
00:23:15,632 --> 00:23:17,866
Oh. As you wish, Georgia.

513
00:23:20,198 --> 00:23:23,075
Yeah, I'm good with Mr. Cotton.

514
00:23:23,211 --> 00:23:24,508
Ah.
Hi, guys.

515
00:23:24,644 --> 00:23:26,045
Well, there goes Wren.

516
00:23:26,181 --> 00:23:27,909
Bye, guys.

517
00:23:28,044 --> 00:23:30,140
Uh, Georgia,
perhaps I can give you a lift?

518
00:23:30,275 --> 00:23:31,544
Ah, let's do it.
Yeah.

519
00:23:35,049 --> 00:23:37,281
Bye.
See you there.

520
00:23:38,292 --> 00:23:40,983
Isn't he amazing?

521
00:23:41,118 --> 00:23:42,822
Only if he drops her.

522
00:23:42,957 --> 00:23:44,523
- Dad.
- Come on. Let's go.

523
00:23:50,634 --> 00:23:52,229
This is just close family?

524
00:23:52,364 --> 00:23:54,230
And the incredible thing is...

525
00:23:54,366 --> 00:23:56,540
is that they're all
actually close.

526
00:23:56,675 --> 00:23:59,034
Okay. Remember,
shoes off inside,

527
00:23:59,170 --> 00:24:00,677
eat with your right hand,

528
00:24:00,812 --> 00:24:03,713
and never,
ever touch anyone's head.

529
00:24:03,848 --> 00:24:06,549
Why would I want to touch
anyone's head?

530
00:24:06,684 --> 00:24:07,951
Hey, guys.
Mr. C.

531
00:24:08,087 --> 00:24:09,087
Hmm?

532
00:24:09,188 --> 00:24:11,123
This is Komang,

533
00:24:11,259 --> 00:24:13,553
and these are his tattoos.

534
00:24:13,688 --> 00:24:14,851
Nice to meet you.

535
00:24:14,987 --> 00:24:16,386
He doesn't know it,

536
00:24:16,522 --> 00:24:17,732
but we're gonna be
having breakfast tomorrow.

537
00:24:17,756 --> 00:24:19,026
Hey.

538
00:24:20,994 --> 00:24:22,801
Is she coming to breakfast, too?

539
00:24:25,265 --> 00:24:26,768
I need to get one of those.

540
00:24:29,042 --> 00:24:30,870
<i>Putri.</i>

541
00:24:31,006 --> 00:24:32,974
- Hey.
- What did he call you?

542
00:24:33,109 --> 00:24:35,777
It means "daughter."

543
00:24:35,913 --> 00:24:36,982
You're my daughter.

544
00:24:37,117 --> 00:24:38,375
My daughter.

545
00:24:40,354 --> 00:24:41,550
Oh.

546
00:24:41,685 --> 00:24:43,048
From here on, we will share her.

547
00:24:43,183 --> 00:24:44,654
We'll be united
for all of time...

548
00:24:44,790 --> 00:24:46,222
- Yeah.
- In the unbreakable

549
00:24:46,357 --> 00:24:47,721
bond of family.

550
00:24:47,857 --> 00:24:48,984
- It's us.
- Okay. Yeah.

551
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,219
You can let go anytime.

552
00:24:50,354 --> 00:24:52,394
- Good.
- Yeah.

553
00:24:52,530 --> 00:24:53,823
Now give me your knife.

554
00:24:53,958 --> 00:24:55,760
My... my knife?

555
00:24:55,896 --> 00:24:57,333
Give me your knife.

556
00:24:57,469 --> 00:24:59,136
I didn't bring a knife.

557
00:24:59,271 --> 00:25:00,569
No knife?

558
00:25:00,705 --> 00:25:01,767
I didn't bring a knife.

559
00:25:01,902 --> 00:25:03,107
- No knife?
- No, no.

560
00:25:03,243 --> 00:25:04,671
Okay.

561
00:25:04,807 --> 00:25:06,275
- No problem.
- Wow.

562
00:25:08,210 --> 00:25:11,310
It is a Balinese custom
that upon meeting,

563
00:25:11,445 --> 00:25:15,112
the two fathers must cut deeply
into their forearms

564
00:25:15,247 --> 00:25:18,747
and each smear the other blood.

565
00:25:20,427 --> 00:25:22,193
You should really see your face.

566
00:25:28,501 --> 00:25:29,993
Hey, guys.

567
00:25:30,129 --> 00:25:31,467
- Give me some.
- Hi.

568
00:25:31,602 --> 00:25:33,303
Yeah. Ow, ow, ow, ow!

569
00:25:36,810 --> 00:25:38,609
What's amazing is,
with such a big family,

570
00:25:38,745 --> 00:25:40,372
there's always something
to celebrate.

571
00:25:40,507 --> 00:25:42,672
But if not, they just celebrate
that it's a big family.

572
00:25:42,808 --> 00:25:44,586
All right, well, I need to
celebrate learning some names,

573
00:25:44,610 --> 00:25:46,221
because there's just
too many people to remember.

574
00:25:46,245 --> 00:25:47,953
Yeah. I did make a spreadsheet.

575
00:25:48,088 --> 00:25:50,380
I haven't gotten most of them.
I usually just smile a lot.

576
00:25:50,516 --> 00:25:52,720
Oh, you're in the kitchen.
That's new.

577
00:25:52,856 --> 00:25:55,058
Lily.
<i>Meme.</i>

578
00:25:55,194 --> 00:25:56,352
Oh!

579
00:25:56,488 --> 00:25:57,891
Mom, Dad, this is
Gede's mother Suli

580
00:25:58,026 --> 00:25:59,456
- and his sister Losi.
- Oh.

581
00:25:59,592 --> 00:26:01,192
Losi's training to be
a doctor... Mm.

582
00:26:01,328 --> 00:26:03,529
Fantastic.
Hi. Nice to meet you.

583
00:26:03,664 --> 00:26:04,862
Yeah.

584
00:26:25,623 --> 00:26:27,660
She says, "Welcome."

585
00:26:28,656 --> 00:26:29,691
Oh.

586
00:26:31,358 --> 00:26:32,830
The kids play football out here

587
00:26:32,965 --> 00:26:34,423
in the morning before school.
Mm.

588
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:35,897
You'd be welcome to join in.

589
00:26:36,033 --> 00:26:38,568
Not my game.
I wouldn't count on it.

590
00:26:38,703 --> 00:26:40,406
How do you farm the seaweed?

591
00:26:40,541 --> 00:26:42,070
- Ah. Uh, we use nets.
- Mm.

592
00:26:42,206 --> 00:26:44,336
Uh, seedlings are tied
to monofilament lines,

593
00:26:44,471 --> 00:26:46,944
then five weeks later,
we bring them in.

594
00:26:47,079 --> 00:26:49,544
A distributor flash-freezes it
and ships it out.

595
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:51,416
Ships it to where?

596
00:26:51,551 --> 00:26:53,075
It used to be mainly Japan.

597
00:26:53,211 --> 00:26:55,248
Now all over the world.

598
00:26:55,384 --> 00:26:57,248
Uh, we just signed a deal
with Whole Foods,

599
00:26:57,384 --> 00:26:59,549
so we're around
your street corner.

600
00:27:01,318 --> 00:27:03,091
Hmm.

601
00:27:10,098 --> 00:27:11,803
He says you are very beautiful.

602
00:27:11,938 --> 00:27:14,569
Oh. Well, um, tell him
I said thank you.

603
00:27:18,203 --> 00:27:20,272
And now he is saying

604
00:27:20,408 --> 00:27:22,871
you remind him of
a very attractive horse.

605
00:27:23,007 --> 00:27:24,748
Oh.

606
00:27:24,883 --> 00:27:26,911
- Really?
- That can't be right.

607
00:27:33,857 --> 00:27:35,491
No, he... he did mean horse.

608
00:27:35,627 --> 00:27:37,122
Oh.

609
00:27:37,258 --> 00:27:39,162
Hmm.

610
00:27:39,298 --> 00:27:40,590
Oh.

611
00:27:42,030 --> 00:27:43,494
- Mr. Cotton?
- Hmm?

612
00:27:43,630 --> 00:27:45,765
I must tell you, I love
your daughter very much.

613
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:48,005
I don't blame you.

614
00:27:48,141 --> 00:27:50,237
And I appreciate that
it's happening really fast,

615
00:27:50,372 --> 00:27:52,842
and you and Georgia
must be alarmed by that.

616
00:27:52,977 --> 00:27:56,071
Well, you two seem good
together.

617
00:27:56,206 --> 00:27:57,915
Lily loves Bali.

618
00:27:58,050 --> 00:28:01,083
I can see her being happy here
for a while.

619
00:28:02,487 --> 00:28:04,346
For a while?

620
00:28:04,481 --> 00:28:06,055
Well, nothing lasts forever.

621
00:28:07,054 --> 00:28:08,785
Marriage is supposed to.

622
00:28:08,921 --> 00:28:11,455
That's what I thought till I
was sitting across from Georgia

623
00:28:11,591 --> 00:28:14,793
with a bunch of lawyers
dividing up our stuff.

624
00:28:14,928 --> 00:28:17,759
So, enjoy this.

625
00:28:17,895 --> 00:28:20,639
Right up until the minute
that Lily ends it,

626
00:28:20,774 --> 00:28:23,607
which she will
because she's ambitious

627
00:28:23,742 --> 00:28:25,435
and she's endlessly curious.

628
00:28:25,570 --> 00:28:27,272
And as beautiful
as this island is,

629
00:28:27,407 --> 00:28:31,146
and as pleasant
as you seem to be,

630
00:28:31,281 --> 00:28:33,412
ultimately,
it's just not gonna be enough.

631
00:28:35,183 --> 00:28:37,483
Bit of advice: Don't have kids.

632
00:28:37,619 --> 00:28:39,821
Makes it much more complicated
when she takes them

633
00:28:39,956 --> 00:28:41,959
and she goes back to the States.

634
00:28:44,630 --> 00:28:47,160
I'm hungry. You hungry?

635
00:28:47,295 --> 00:28:48,667
Yeah, let's get
something to eat.

636
00:28:48,803 --> 00:28:50,836
Let's get some food.

637
00:29:04,875 --> 00:29:08,485
Today, in honor of our guests
of distinction,

638
00:29:08,621 --> 00:29:10,018
I speak to you English.

639
00:29:10,154 --> 00:29:11,886
I'm pretty sure
you don't win anything

640
00:29:12,021 --> 00:29:13,721
for finishing the whole pig.

641
00:29:13,857 --> 00:29:16,057
Paul's such a lucky guy.

642
00:29:16,192 --> 00:29:18,258
All that judgment
all to himself.

643
00:29:18,394 --> 00:29:21,063
Suli and I welcome
with love and peace

644
00:29:21,198 --> 00:29:23,934
all friends and family
into our home.

645
00:29:24,070 --> 00:29:28,871
Soon also to be the home
of Gede and Lily.

646
00:29:29,006 --> 00:29:30,708
- Or not.
- And how proud we are...

647
00:29:30,843 --> 00:29:32,535
Gede is having second thoughts.

648
00:29:32,671 --> 00:29:34,107
I saw the two of you.
What happened?

649
00:29:34,243 --> 00:29:36,741
I initiated phase two.

650
00:29:36,876 --> 00:29:39,243
We get out of the Trojan horse.
We start killing people.

651
00:29:39,379 --> 00:29:41,720
We are nowhere near phase two.

652
00:29:41,855 --> 00:29:43,346
Maybe you're at
a different party,

653
00:29:43,481 --> 00:29:44,921
but from where I'm sitting,

654
00:29:45,057 --> 00:29:47,024
we're about to inherit
150 new in-laws.

655
00:29:47,159 --> 00:29:49,224
Oh, God. You only ever
see things your own way.

656
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:51,139
Everybody only ever sees
anything their own way.

657
00:29:51,163 --> 00:29:52,860
Explains why you walked out
on me and Lily.

658
00:29:52,996 --> 00:29:54,400
I didn't walk out on Lily.

659
00:29:54,535 --> 00:29:57,760
<i>Desa, kala, patra.</i>

660
00:29:57,895 --> 00:30:02,134
For marriage,
it must to be right place.

661
00:30:02,270 --> 00:30:05,073
It must to be the right time.

662
00:30:05,209 --> 00:30:07,374
It must to be
the right circumstance.

663
00:30:07,509 --> 00:30:08,921
I wish someone had have
explained that to us.

664
00:30:08,945 --> 00:30:11,109
We were oh for three.

665
00:30:11,245 --> 00:30:12,647
- One for three.
- Hmm?

666
00:30:12,783 --> 00:30:14,279
One for three.

667
00:30:14,414 --> 00:30:16,288
Wrong circumstance, wrong time.

668
00:30:16,423 --> 00:30:18,455
Right place.

669
00:30:18,590 --> 00:30:20,451
By the lake.

670
00:30:20,587 --> 00:30:24,726
So I announce that Gede
will marry Lily

671
00:30:24,862 --> 00:30:26,490
in four days' time,

672
00:30:26,626 --> 00:30:30,133
as suggested
by Ida Anak Lingsir.

673
00:30:32,203 --> 00:30:34,769
Mother of my children,
do you agree?

674
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:45,812
She gives her blessing,
for now and for always.

675
00:30:45,947 --> 00:30:47,618
And, David?

676
00:30:47,753 --> 00:30:49,548
Georgia? Do you agree?

677
00:30:50,823 --> 00:30:54,086
Um, y-yes, we give our blessing.

678
00:30:54,222 --> 00:30:55,958
- Yep.
- Y-Yes, for now.

679
00:30:56,093 --> 00:30:57,355
- And always.
- And always.

680
00:30:57,490 --> 00:30:58,660
Great, great.
Right.

681
00:30:58,795 --> 00:31:00,592
That's good.

682
00:31:05,003 --> 00:31:07,640
LILY That went great.

683
00:31:07,775 --> 00:31:09,598
Just great.

684
00:31:09,733 --> 00:31:11,369
Absolutely, it did.

685
00:31:11,504 --> 00:31:13,407
Could not have gone any better.

686
00:31:16,448 --> 00:31:18,642
What were you and my dad
talking about by the beach?

687
00:31:18,778 --> 00:31:21,580
Seaweed, mostly.
He had a lot of questions.

688
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:25,819
He loves you.

689
00:31:25,955 --> 00:31:27,986
He loves you.

690
00:31:28,122 --> 00:31:30,391
They both do.

691
00:31:30,527 --> 00:31:33,698
Well, I'm the only thing
they can ever agree on.

692
00:31:33,833 --> 00:31:36,291
Really?

693
00:31:36,427 --> 00:31:38,003
Good to know.

694
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:43,067
<i>Welcome to the Hotel Waruna.</i>

695
00:31:43,202 --> 00:31:47,375
<i>It is a very great pleasure
to see your smiling faces.</i>

696
00:31:48,539 --> 00:31:51,406
You, sir, are in 221.

697
00:31:51,541 --> 00:31:52,851
Really good room.

698
00:31:52,987 --> 00:31:55,178
Make sure I'm
a long way from her.

699
00:31:55,313 --> 00:31:56,879
And you, madam?

700
00:31:57,889 --> 00:31:59,889
A very long way, please.

701
00:32:00,024 --> 00:32:03,457
222. Almost just as really good.

702
00:32:05,633 --> 00:32:07,394
Do you still snore?

703
00:32:07,529 --> 00:32:09,358
Do you know anybody
that snores less

704
00:32:09,494 --> 00:32:10,893
when they get older?

705
00:32:11,028 --> 00:32:12,904
I'm gonna be listening
to you all night,

706
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:15,304
I'm gonna do it
from the better room.

707
00:32:16,538 --> 00:32:18,602
You know you used to do
sleep karate?

708
00:32:18,738 --> 00:32:20,373
You'd fling yourself
around the bed

709
00:32:20,509 --> 00:32:22,172
- like you were attacking it.
- Mm.

710
00:32:22,307 --> 00:32:23,772
I wasn't asleep.

711
00:32:23,908 --> 00:32:26,414
- I was attacking you.
- There you go.

712
00:32:27,888 --> 00:32:29,181
Try to keep the snoring down.

713
00:32:29,316 --> 00:32:30,781
I have a nasal strip.

714
00:32:30,916 --> 00:32:33,520
It's a mystery
you're still alone.

715
00:33:02,747 --> 00:33:04,648
Can I get another one of these?

716
00:33:04,784 --> 00:33:07,389
I'll have two
of whatever he's having.

717
00:33:08,590 --> 00:33:10,720
Hello, Wren.
What are you doing here?

718
00:33:10,856 --> 00:33:12,329
Unlike your daughter,
I've never been

719
00:33:12,464 --> 00:33:14,757
a "thatched hut with
a dirt floor" kind of gal.

720
00:33:14,893 --> 00:33:16,759
- Mm.
- I've got a nicely appointed

721
00:33:16,894 --> 00:33:18,961
- broom closet here.
- Good for you.

722
00:33:20,802 --> 00:33:23,401
You know, I blame you
for this whole shit show.

723
00:33:23,536 --> 00:33:25,411
That's what you think of it?

724
00:33:25,546 --> 00:33:26,841
You don't?

725
00:33:26,977 --> 00:33:28,837
Lily's happy.

726
00:33:28,973 --> 00:33:30,974
And after four years
of watching her

727
00:33:31,109 --> 00:33:34,345
beat herself up at college,
I love to see that.

728
00:33:34,481 --> 00:33:35,984
I thought you might, too.

729
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:38,022
Hey, look, happy is great.

730
00:33:38,158 --> 00:33:40,350
Lily happy is
the greatest of all.

731
00:33:40,485 --> 00:33:42,821
It's just that...

732
00:33:42,956 --> 00:33:45,521
a weird thing happens
when you become a parent.

733
00:33:45,656 --> 00:33:47,527
When your kid is down,

734
00:33:47,662 --> 00:33:50,697
when they're in pain,
it kills you.

735
00:33:50,832 --> 00:33:54,599
But when they're up,
when things are going great,

736
00:33:54,734 --> 00:33:56,668
that's when you get
really scared.

737
00:33:56,803 --> 00:33:59,172
Because you don't want it
to change,

738
00:33:59,307 --> 00:34:01,436
and you know it will.

739
00:34:01,571 --> 00:34:03,482
Does it always?

740
00:34:06,685 --> 00:34:08,213
Mm.

741
00:34:08,349 --> 00:34:10,351
Lily's never said...

742
00:34:10,487 --> 00:34:12,717
What happened
with you and Mrs. C?

743
00:34:12,853 --> 00:34:16,126
Same thing that happens
in every relationship.

744
00:34:16,262 --> 00:34:18,856
When it started out,
it was unreal.

745
00:34:20,527 --> 00:34:23,630
Then it got real.

746
00:34:31,202 --> 00:34:34,912
We used to bike out
to this place by the lake.

747
00:34:35,048 --> 00:34:37,611
You know, read, eat, whatever.

748
00:34:39,011 --> 00:34:40,817
And then one day,
I saw that that place,

749
00:34:40,953 --> 00:34:43,153
that spot was for sale.

750
00:34:43,289 --> 00:34:44,981
Now, we were young.
We had nothing.

751
00:34:45,116 --> 00:34:48,260
But I said,
"Someday we should live here."

752
00:34:48,395 --> 00:34:53,363
And then she said,
with that smile in her voice...

753
00:34:55,193 --> 00:34:57,928
"Why wait? Why save
the good stuff for later?

754
00:34:58,064 --> 00:35:01,563
Don't we deserve
some good stuff along the way?"

755
00:35:01,698 --> 00:35:03,934
Ah, she was right.

756
00:35:04,069 --> 00:35:07,674
Which happens occasionally.

757
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:11,448
Uh...

758
00:35:11,583 --> 00:35:13,747
we saved and we scrambled,
and next thing you know,

759
00:35:13,883 --> 00:35:16,881
I'm building the perfect house
in the perfect spot.

760
00:35:21,858 --> 00:35:25,028
So, I was busy. I was working,
paying off our debt.

761
00:35:25,163 --> 00:35:27,199
I was tired. She was tired.

762
00:35:29,028 --> 00:35:30,933
Then, pretty soon,
it didn't feel like

763
00:35:31,069 --> 00:35:33,728
we were married at all.

764
00:35:33,864 --> 00:35:37,101
Just felt like we were...

765
00:35:37,237 --> 00:35:40,872
running a day care camp with
someone we used to go out with.

766
00:35:44,075 --> 00:35:45,614
We were sniping,
we were fighting,

767
00:35:45,749 --> 00:35:47,589
we were tearing each other
down, and I thought,

768
00:35:47,616 --> 00:35:52,086
if I could just get her
in that house,

769
00:35:52,222 --> 00:35:54,226
it'd fix everything.

770
00:35:56,226 --> 00:35:58,230
Make everything okay.

771
00:36:01,133 --> 00:36:03,960
So, one night, I get a call

772
00:36:04,096 --> 00:36:07,271
from the people
who lived across the lake.

773
00:36:07,406 --> 00:36:10,209
They said they'd seen
these flames.

774
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:20,219
By the time I got there,
it was just ash.

775
00:36:23,947 --> 00:36:26,885
Three weeks later, we were done.

776
00:36:29,291 --> 00:36:30,724
Over a house?

777
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,793
Seemed like
a lot more than that.

778
00:36:38,729 --> 00:36:40,162
Good night, Wren.

779
00:36:56,182 --> 00:36:57,884
PAUL
Hey, it's looking like I'm not

780
00:36:58,019 --> 00:36:59,819
gonna make it till
the morning of the wedding.

781
00:36:59,850 --> 00:37:01,488
I-I'm so sorry, baby.

782
00:37:01,623 --> 00:37:03,722
- How's Lily?
- Crazy in love.

783
00:37:03,857 --> 00:37:05,791
- That's fantastic.
- It's terrible.

784
00:37:05,927 --> 00:37:08,057
I couldn't agree more.
She's making a mistake.

785
00:37:08,193 --> 00:37:10,160
And now there's some kind
of ceremony.

786
00:37:10,296 --> 00:37:12,997
Gede and Lily exchange rings.
It's a whole thing.

787
00:37:13,132 --> 00:37:15,238
They're not doing the rings
at the wedding?

788
00:37:15,373 --> 00:37:16,637
There's not gonna be a wedding.

789
00:37:16,772 --> 00:37:18,300
I won't let her throw
her life away

790
00:37:18,436 --> 00:37:20,115
on some insanely handsome guy
who happens to live

791
00:37:20,139 --> 00:37:21,810
in the most beautiful place
on Earth.

792
00:37:21,946 --> 00:37:24,118
And yes, I do know how that
sounds, but I'm still right.

793
00:37:24,142 --> 00:37:25,779
You're always right, baby.

794
00:37:26,782 --> 00:37:28,262
- We got action.
- Oh. I'm really not.

795
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:30,850
- Got to go.
- Uh, uh...

796
00:37:33,556 --> 00:37:34,853
- Talk to me.
- All right.

797
00:37:34,989 --> 00:37:36,369
The happy couple's about
to stand up there.

798
00:37:36,393 --> 00:37:37,673
The ring bearer brings two rings

799
00:37:37,793 --> 00:37:39,254
that have been blessed
by the hat guy

800
00:37:39,389 --> 00:37:41,492
for them to exchange,
but if they don't,

801
00:37:41,628 --> 00:37:42,829
it messes with the whole

802
00:37:42,964 --> 00:37:44,514
"right place, right time,
right whatever."

803
00:37:44,538 --> 00:37:45,543
- So we steal the rings.
- I was about to say that.

804
00:37:45,567 --> 00:37:46,999
But you didn't, so it's my idea.

805
00:37:47,134 --> 00:37:50,006
Okay, well, the ring bearer
is Gede's cousin.

806
00:37:53,010 --> 00:37:54,379
Why me?

807
00:37:54,514 --> 00:37:55,952
Well, the hard stuff
was always your thing.

808
00:37:55,976 --> 00:37:57,381
My thing was
taking out the garbage

809
00:37:57,517 --> 00:37:59,037
and getting things
off of high shelves.

810
00:37:59,145 --> 00:38:01,209
Not that high, really.
And flattery won't work.

811
00:38:01,344 --> 00:38:03,713
- Ah, but you'll do it anyway.
- Why?

812
00:38:03,849 --> 00:38:06,149
Because it was your idea.

813
00:38:15,726 --> 00:38:17,093
Hey, guys.

814
00:38:17,228 --> 00:38:19,203
You play chasing game with us?

815
00:38:19,338 --> 00:38:20,935
Can I show you something first?

816
00:38:21,071 --> 00:38:22,704
Let me show you something.

817
00:38:22,839 --> 00:38:25,067
'Cause, see, I'm from America,
and in America,

818
00:38:25,203 --> 00:38:27,806
we eat bananas
a little differently.

819
00:38:27,942 --> 00:38:31,609
We slice them
before we peel them.

820
00:38:31,744 --> 00:38:33,114
Not true!

821
00:38:33,250 --> 00:38:34,978
Totally true.

822
00:38:35,113 --> 00:38:36,987
Uh, here, I'll show you.
Come here.

823
00:38:37,122 --> 00:38:38,786
Come sit up here.

824
00:38:40,193 --> 00:38:41,422
All right. See this banana?

825
00:38:41,558 --> 00:38:43,054
Totally normal-looking, right?

826
00:38:43,189 --> 00:38:44,791
- It's not cut on the outside.
- Not cut.

827
00:38:44,927 --> 00:38:46,623
All right,
so I want you to take it...

828
00:38:46,759 --> 00:38:47,991
Here, put your bag down.

829
00:38:48,127 --> 00:38:50,292
You're gonna take it
and peel it.

830
00:38:58,870 --> 00:39:00,507
That's how it's done.

831
00:39:06,147 --> 00:39:08,012
So, the rings
that we'll give each other

832
00:39:08,148 --> 00:39:10,020
have been blessed
in the sacred water

833
00:39:10,156 --> 00:39:12,457
of Pura Ulun Danu Batur.

834
00:39:13,456 --> 00:39:15,394
I do the hard stuff.

835
00:39:17,454 --> 00:39:20,093
Can't believe they fell
for the banana trick.

836
00:39:20,229 --> 00:39:22,664
Really kills you that you
haven't figured it out. -Ah...

837
00:39:22,799 --> 00:39:24,299
Maybe we'll show them to you.

838
00:39:24,435 --> 00:39:26,662
Uh, Ketut has them. Ketut?

839
00:39:26,797 --> 00:39:28,665
Here we go.

840
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,539
Hey.

841
00:39:30,675 --> 00:39:32,906
Can you show us the rings?
Yeah?

842
00:39:34,137 --> 00:39:36,710
Hmm. Where are the rings?

843
00:39:36,846 --> 00:39:38,544
- There's nothing in there.
- Shh.

844
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:39,680
It's empty.

845
00:39:41,114 --> 00:39:42,185
It's gone.
Okay.

846
00:39:45,984 --> 00:39:47,855
Losi!

847
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:51,856
What is he saying?

848
00:39:51,992 --> 00:39:53,725
- I-I wasn't listening.
- Cool.

849
00:39:55,863 --> 00:39:57,831
Uh, "We have to have the rings"

850
00:39:57,966 --> 00:39:59,369
for the circumstances
to be right."

851
00:39:59,504 --> 00:40:00,833
Yeah.
Hmm.

852
00:40:00,969 --> 00:40:03,403
Now no one knows what to do.

853
00:40:03,539 --> 00:40:04,907
And Ketut is crying.

854
00:40:05,043 --> 00:40:07,073
Aw.

855
00:40:07,208 --> 00:40:09,709
Hey, sweetie, it's okay.
Tell her it's gonna be okay.

856
00:40:09,844 --> 00:40:11,374
It's not gonna be okay.

857
00:40:11,509 --> 00:40:13,469
Look, if we don't have
the rings, then we can't...

858
00:40:17,656 --> 00:40:19,323
You're right.
It's not a problem.

859
00:40:19,458 --> 00:40:20,738
- We'll find other rings.
- Yeah.

860
00:40:20,822 --> 00:40:22,384
Did you hear that? It's fine.

861
00:40:22,519 --> 00:40:24,661
We'll just do it another day.
It's okay.

862
00:40:31,335 --> 00:40:33,698
How do they look?

863
00:40:33,834 --> 00:40:35,599
I'll do the stretch thing.

864
00:40:35,734 --> 00:40:37,338
The classic.

865
00:40:40,971 --> 00:40:42,245
Disappointed.

866
00:40:42,381 --> 00:40:43,674
- That's good.
- Is it?

867
00:40:43,809 --> 00:40:45,243
What do you mean?

868
00:40:45,378 --> 00:40:47,058
I mean our daughter looks
like her dog just died.

869
00:40:47,082 --> 00:40:48,943
I don't know if I feel
great about that. -Oh.

870
00:40:49,079 --> 00:40:50,415
We're nearly there.

871
00:40:50,550 --> 00:40:52,385
Where?

872
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:54,218
You'll see.

873
00:40:55,253 --> 00:40:56,719
I think he knows.

874
00:40:56,854 --> 00:40:58,392
He doesn't know.

875
00:41:00,367 --> 00:41:02,365
Okay.

876
00:41:02,501 --> 00:41:04,133
- Are they here?
- They're here.

877
00:41:04,268 --> 00:41:05,933
Who's here?

878
00:41:11,401 --> 00:41:13,237
Dolphins.

879
00:41:16,049 --> 00:41:17,478
Are you kidding?

880
00:41:17,614 --> 00:41:19,782
It gets better.

881
00:41:21,914 --> 00:41:23,716
What are you doing?

882
00:41:23,851 --> 00:41:25,715
Ah, don't be afraid, Mr. Cotton.

883
00:41:25,850 --> 00:41:27,383
I'm not afraid.

884
00:41:27,519 --> 00:41:29,261
- GEORGIA You are.
- No, I'm not.

885
00:41:29,396 --> 00:41:31,626
I'm not afraid.

886
00:41:31,761 --> 00:41:33,796
Hey. What are you...

887
00:41:35,768 --> 00:41:38,031
Oh, my God, this is amazing.

888
00:41:55,421 --> 00:41:57,215
Mom.

889
00:42:00,056 --> 00:42:01,689
Hey, are you sure
they're not sharks?

890
00:42:01,824 --> 00:42:03,022
They're not sharks.

891
00:42:03,158 --> 00:42:04,574
They might be working
with the sharks,

892
00:42:04,598 --> 00:42:05,772
you know, to get us.
Oh, Dad.

893
00:42:05,796 --> 00:42:07,358
Don't miss out.
Come on. Get in.

894
00:42:07,493 --> 00:42:09,108
Come on, don't be a chicken.
Don't miss out.

895
00:42:09,132 --> 00:42:10,270
I'm not a chicken.
Come on, chicken.

896
00:42:10,294 --> 00:42:11,492
Oh, stop it.

897
00:42:11,628 --> 00:42:13,045
You've turned chicken
in your old age.

898
00:42:13,069 --> 00:42:14,640
- Come on, David.
- I'm chicken? Oh, chicken?

899
00:42:14,664 --> 00:42:16,441
I'll show you chicken.
Show you chicken.

900
00:42:16,577 --> 00:42:17,875
I'll go. Let's go.

901
00:42:25,947 --> 00:42:27,619
Ooh.

902
00:42:27,754 --> 00:42:29,279
I can't believe I got bit
by a dolphin.

903
00:42:29,414 --> 00:42:31,280
You were grazed.

904
00:42:31,416 --> 00:42:32,976
This has never happened before.
Yeah.

905
00:42:33,092 --> 00:42:34,215
Dad?

906
00:42:34,351 --> 00:42:35,987
Dad, Dad. Be careful with him!

907
00:42:36,122 --> 00:42:37,685
Does it hurt?

908
00:42:37,820 --> 00:42:39,828
I bet it was that crazy-looking
one with the smile.

909
00:42:39,964 --> 00:42:42,059
- All dolphins smile.
- Now we know why.

910
00:42:42,194 --> 00:42:44,060
- It wasn't Gede's fault.
- Yeah.

911
00:42:44,196 --> 00:42:45,305
We know. These things happen.

912
00:42:45,329 --> 00:42:47,131
No, he did just say they don't.

913
00:42:47,267 --> 00:42:49,032
Georgia, can you please
apply pressure?

914
00:42:49,167 --> 00:42:51,037
I'm gonna go grab some bandages.

915
00:42:51,173 --> 00:42:52,867
We wouldn't want you
to lose your leg.

916
00:42:53,002 --> 00:42:54,304
What?

917
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:56,439
Enough things have already
been lost today.

918
00:42:59,451 --> 00:43:00,685
Oh, yeah. He knows.

919
00:43:02,220 --> 00:43:03,956
- Ow! What's wrong with you?
- Does it hurt when I do that?

920
00:43:03,980 --> 00:43:05,980
He said pressure. He said,
"Georgia, pressure." -

921
00:43:07,892 --> 00:43:09,586
- It's like
I looked up and realized

922
00:43:09,722 --> 00:43:12,423
that everything I ever wanted
was right in front of me.

923
00:43:12,559 --> 00:43:15,160
Yeah, I could go back
and try and make a go of it,

924
00:43:15,295 --> 00:43:17,368
but I just know that,
every second,

925
00:43:17,503 --> 00:43:19,330
I'd be dreaming of being here...

926
00:43:20,635 --> 00:43:22,067
with him.

927
00:43:22,203 --> 00:43:24,003
You know, it's like
you always say:

928
00:43:24,138 --> 00:43:26,172
Why save the good stuff
for later?

929
00:43:27,312 --> 00:43:29,340
Yeah, I do.

930
00:43:30,842 --> 00:43:32,116
I do.

931
00:43:32,251 --> 00:43:33,284
Excuse me.

932
00:43:33,419 --> 00:43:34,714
I'd like to get these.

933
00:43:34,849 --> 00:43:36,115
You're tourists, yes?

934
00:43:36,251 --> 00:43:38,580
Oh, well, she is,
but I live here now.

935
00:43:40,551 --> 00:43:42,756
Ah. Then we haggle.
Oh.

936
00:43:42,891 --> 00:43:44,185
Uh, no, we don't need to haggle.

937
00:43:44,321 --> 00:43:45,429
Just give me a fair price.

938
00:43:45,564 --> 00:43:47,762
Tourists like it when we haggle.

939
00:43:47,897 --> 00:43:49,892
Americans like make good deals.

940
00:43:50,027 --> 00:43:52,069
800,000 rupiah?

941
00:43:52,204 --> 00:43:53,428
Okay.

942
00:43:53,564 --> 00:43:56,235
No, no. You say 500,000.

943
00:43:58,041 --> 00:43:59,935
Just go with it, Mom.

944
00:44:00,070 --> 00:44:02,547
Um, 500,000.

945
00:44:02,682 --> 00:44:04,213
Enough, please.
You're killing me.

946
00:44:04,348 --> 00:44:05,348
Seven.

947
00:44:05,452 --> 00:44:07,910
Six, or I'm walking away.

948
00:44:08,045 --> 00:44:09,220
We have a deal.

949
00:44:09,356 --> 00:44:11,320
Thank you.

950
00:44:13,024 --> 00:44:14,818
I'm just so crazy grateful
for you, Mom.

951
00:44:14,953 --> 00:44:16,490
There's no need.

952
00:44:16,626 --> 00:44:18,259
Yes, there is.

953
00:44:18,395 --> 00:44:20,555
This is the biggest decision
I've ever made in my life.

954
00:44:20,593 --> 00:44:22,932
You came halfway around
the world to have my back.

955
00:44:24,561 --> 00:44:27,831
You are a very kind woman.

956
00:44:27,966 --> 00:44:29,273
Thank you.

957
00:44:29,409 --> 00:44:31,402
I'm really not. I...

958
00:44:34,078 --> 00:44:36,910
I don't know what this is,
but I like it.

959
00:44:37,045 --> 00:44:39,141
Yeah, it's called a<i> martabak.</i>

960
00:44:39,277 --> 00:44:41,313
<i>- Martabak?</i>
- Mm.

961
00:44:41,449 --> 00:44:44,153
Listen, um, Lily and I
will get other rings,

962
00:44:44,289 --> 00:44:46,782
but it would be much better
if you just give them back.

963
00:44:46,917 --> 00:44:48,957
What are you talking about?
I don't have your rings.

964
00:44:48,985 --> 00:44:51,523
I didn't say
anything to Lily, and I won't.

965
00:44:51,659 --> 00:44:54,019
But, Mr. Cotton, I need you and
Georgia to stop now, please.

966
00:44:54,099 --> 00:44:56,219
You know what I think?
I think you didn't say anything

967
00:44:56,301 --> 00:44:58,541
to Lily because you're afraid
she might be having doubts,

968
00:44:58,605 --> 00:45:00,136
and if you did say something,

969
00:45:00,272 --> 00:45:02,051
she might listen to those
doubts, or worse than that,

970
00:45:02,075 --> 00:45:03,810
- she might act on them.
- I haven't told Lily anything

971
00:45:03,834 --> 00:45:05,814
because I know it would
hurt her very much to know that

972
00:45:05,838 --> 00:45:07,585
the real reason her parents
are finally getting along

973
00:45:07,609 --> 00:45:09,319
is because they're united
to sabotage her relationship.

974
00:45:09,343 --> 00:45:11,245
If anyone here is afraid,
it's you.

975
00:45:12,281 --> 00:45:14,041
I'm not here to steal
your daughter from you.

976
00:45:14,117 --> 00:45:15,643
That's the last thing
I want to do.

977
00:45:15,779 --> 00:45:18,354
She's not a competition
to be won or lost.

978
00:45:18,489 --> 00:45:20,452
Look, trust me.

979
00:45:20,587 --> 00:45:22,726
If Lily finds out what you two
are really doing,

980
00:45:22,862 --> 00:45:24,928
you'll most certainly
lose her then.

981
00:45:26,027 --> 00:45:27,766
Enjoy your<i> martabak.</i>

982
00:45:32,597 --> 00:45:34,067
<i>Remind me, were the guys</i>

983
00:45:34,202 --> 00:45:36,166
in the Trojan horse
the good guys?

984
00:45:36,302 --> 00:45:37,741
Good or bad, they won the war.

985
00:45:37,876 --> 00:45:39,405
And what was the war about
exactly?

986
00:45:39,540 --> 00:45:41,353
- Don't do this, Georgia.
- Do you think we're wrong?

987
00:45:41,377 --> 00:45:43,189
- We're not wrong.
- I think we might be wrong.

988
00:45:43,213 --> 00:45:44,822
Remember when we agreed
to do this together?

989
00:45:44,846 --> 00:45:46,246
To be in lockstep?

990
00:45:46,382 --> 00:45:48,917
Yeah, but that was before
we saw her... saw them.

991
00:45:49,052 --> 00:45:50,849
Oh, you know...
Oh, great.

992
00:45:50,985 --> 00:45:52,823
Classic. You win again.

993
00:45:52,959 --> 00:45:54,631
- What does that even mean?
- You know what?

994
00:45:54,655 --> 00:45:56,761
I had Lily one day a week
and every other weekend.

995
00:45:56,897 --> 00:45:59,063
You had her
all the rest of the time.

996
00:45:59,199 --> 00:46:01,359
I mean, she listened to you,
she relied on you, and now

997
00:46:01,465 --> 00:46:03,746
you get to be the one that
gives her everything she wants.

998
00:46:03,837 --> 00:46:05,502
I never get to give her
what she wants.

999
00:46:05,638 --> 00:46:06,770
Yes, I was there for her.

1000
00:46:06,906 --> 00:46:08,773
To make the rules,
to fight with.

1001
00:46:08,909 --> 00:46:10,212
You were fun dad.
You would breeze in,

1002
00:46:10,236 --> 00:46:11,602
take her where she wanted to go,

1003
00:46:11,737 --> 00:46:13,383
buy her anything she wanted,
then drop her off

1004
00:46:13,407 --> 00:46:14,647
- and drive away.
- I didn't want that.

1005
00:46:14,671 --> 00:46:15,889
Well, then you shouldn't
have left.

1006
00:46:15,913 --> 00:46:16,989
- I had to. It was over.
- Why?

1007
00:46:17,013 --> 00:46:18,213
Because the house burned down?

1008
00:46:18,246 --> 00:46:19,321
Because you didn't
love me anymore.

1009
00:46:19,345 --> 00:46:20,575
Well, you didn't even like me.

1010
00:46:20,711 --> 00:46:21,996
You didn't have
any respect for me.

1011
00:46:22,020 --> 00:46:23,127
You've never had
any respect for me.

1012
00:46:23,151 --> 00:46:24,449
That is so unbelievably untrue.

1013
00:46:24,584 --> 00:46:26,067
When you proposed,
did you really want to

1014
00:46:26,091 --> 00:46:27,530
get married, or you just
didn't want me to take

1015
00:46:27,554 --> 00:46:29,170
- that job in L.A.?
- I wanted to be happy.

1016
00:46:29,194 --> 00:46:30,406
- I wanted you to be happy.
- Well, I am happy now.

1017
00:46:30,430 --> 00:46:31,430
Good. So am I.

1018
00:46:31,530 --> 00:46:32,530
- Good.
- Great.

1019
00:46:32,562 --> 00:46:33,722
Great.

1020
00:47:13,803 --> 00:47:14,833
- Hi.
- Hey.

1021
00:47:14,968 --> 00:47:15,999
What time is it?

1022
00:47:16,135 --> 00:47:17,165
The best time.

1023
00:47:19,738 --> 00:47:21,678
You don't look like
you were sleeping.

1024
00:47:21,813 --> 00:47:24,345
Mm. I moisturize before bed.

1025
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:26,449
All right.
Well, let's wake up... Oh.

1026
00:47:26,584 --> 00:47:28,117
What's going on?

1027
00:47:29,082 --> 00:47:31,956
- Hi.
- Hi.

1028
00:47:35,095 --> 00:47:39,122
Okay, um, I've got
a little job for you guys.

1029
00:47:39,257 --> 00:47:40,694
Come on. Let's go.

1030
00:47:48,907 --> 00:47:51,503
I can't believe we're out here.

1031
00:47:51,639 --> 00:47:54,336
I'm not sure you should be,
with your wound.

1032
00:47:54,472 --> 00:47:56,508
Sharks are drawn to blood.

1033
00:48:02,183 --> 00:48:04,516
She listened to you always.

1034
00:48:06,282 --> 00:48:07,820
What?

1035
00:48:07,955 --> 00:48:09,322
She still does.

1036
00:48:09,457 --> 00:48:11,023
She never needed
to make me as happy

1037
00:48:11,159 --> 00:48:12,931
as she wanted to make you.

1038
00:48:15,861 --> 00:48:19,570
She's just... so like you.

1039
00:48:19,706 --> 00:48:22,171
I think she's so like you.

1040
00:48:26,980 --> 00:48:29,003
Um, and I'll tell you
something else.

1041
00:48:29,139 --> 00:48:32,742
I'm looking at your pile
of seaweed and at mine, and...

1042
00:48:32,877 --> 00:48:35,016
and, of course,
it's totally not a competition,

1043
00:48:35,152 --> 00:48:38,818
but if it was...

1044
00:48:38,953 --> 00:48:41,124
I'd be winning.

1045
00:48:44,128 --> 00:48:45,828
Good thing it's not
a competition.

1046
00:48:45,964 --> 00:48:48,025
- Mm, it's a good thing.
- Yeah.

1047
00:48:56,904 --> 00:48:59,704
Hey, hey, gentle.
You're supposed to be gentle!

1048
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:01,840
Get off me, get off, get off me!
Excuse me. Aah!

1049
00:49:01,913 --> 00:49:03,110
That's mine. That's mine.

1050
00:49:03,245 --> 00:49:04,713
Aah!
Get off.

1051
00:49:04,848 --> 00:49:06,049
Hey!

1052
00:49:06,185 --> 00:49:08,681
Get off. Get off! Get off!

1053
00:49:08,816 --> 00:49:10,545
What are you doing?
That was mine.

1054
00:49:10,681 --> 00:49:12,185
That was mine. You took mine.

1055
00:49:12,321 --> 00:49:14,415
- Will you stop it?
- Get off.

1056
00:49:15,861 --> 00:49:17,692
Well, this is getting weird.

1057
00:49:26,236 --> 00:49:28,729
Well, that worked
till it didn't.

1058
00:49:28,865 --> 00:49:31,407
They got new rings.

1059
00:49:31,542 --> 00:49:33,734
Thank you for helping
with the harvest this morning.

1060
00:49:33,870 --> 00:49:35,570
Who won?

1061
00:49:35,705 --> 00:49:37,471
No, it wasn't a competition.

1062
00:49:41,012 --> 00:49:42,786
You told her it wasn't
a competition, right?

1063
00:49:42,921 --> 00:49:44,117
That is exactly what I said.

1064
00:49:44,252 --> 00:49:45,780
The hug is about something else.

1065
00:49:45,915 --> 00:49:48,055
<i>Oke deh. Metatah</i> is beginning.

1066
00:49:48,190 --> 00:49:49,493
<i>- Metatah.</i>
- What?

1067
00:49:49,628 --> 00:49:51,260
<i>Metatah.</i>

1068
00:49:53,089 --> 00:49:55,591
You're with me in this, right?
Lockstep?

1069
00:49:55,726 --> 00:49:56,931
- Lockstep.
- In lockstep.

1070
00:49:57,067 --> 00:49:58,729
- Absolutely.
- Okay.

1071
00:50:13,449 --> 00:50:15,317
How is this even a thing?

1072
00:50:15,452 --> 00:50:16,979
Ow!
They believe that filing down

1073
00:50:17,114 --> 00:50:18,994
the canine teeth takes us away
from the animals,

1074
00:50:19,118 --> 00:50:21,854
so away from qualities that
lead to an unhappy marriage.

1075
00:50:21,989 --> 00:50:25,659
Takes away the ability to chew
solid food, is what it does.

1076
00:50:28,729 --> 00:50:30,792
I knew a guy who wanted
to marry a Jewish woman.

1077
00:50:30,927 --> 00:50:32,864
Had to get circumcised.
This is worse.

1078
00:50:35,967 --> 00:50:38,307
No, that's worse.

1079
00:50:41,081 --> 00:50:43,037
Oh, did it hurt?
Hmm.

1080
00:50:43,172 --> 00:50:45,048
I mean, was it
as bad as it looked?

1081
00:50:45,184 --> 00:50:46,843
It was very painful agony.

1082
00:50:46,978 --> 00:50:48,710
Which is why we're here
for some anesthetic.

1083
00:50:48,845 --> 00:50:49,851
Here you go.

1084
00:50:49,986 --> 00:50:51,184
Arrack all around.

1085
00:50:51,320 --> 00:50:52,981
Thanks.
What's arrack?

1086
00:50:53,116 --> 00:50:54,786
I don't know,
but last time I was here,

1087
00:50:54,921 --> 00:50:57,190
I woke up in a tree
with all this sand in my mouth.

1088
00:50:57,326 --> 00:50:58,989
Oh.

1089
00:50:59,125 --> 00:51:01,528
It's a local palm moonshine.
Not for the faint of heart.

1090
00:51:06,435 --> 00:51:08,667
- Little help?
- There you go.

1091
00:51:10,037 --> 00:51:10,906
Ooh.

1092
00:51:11,041 --> 00:51:12,835
Ugh.

1093
00:51:12,970 --> 00:51:15,069
It's not that bad.

1094
00:51:15,205 --> 00:51:18,413
Seriously, Mr. C,
beware the arrack attack.

1095
00:51:18,548 --> 00:51:20,812
Oh, no, no, no.
This is not his first rodeo.

1096
00:51:20,947 --> 00:51:23,078
Remember all the beer pong
we played in college?

1097
00:51:23,213 --> 00:51:25,026
Practically minored in it.
You were unbelievable.

1098
00:51:25,050 --> 00:51:27,421
Well, yes,
but you had game, too.

1099
00:51:27,557 --> 00:51:28,883
I did have game.

1100
00:51:29,018 --> 00:51:30,854
Own it. Own it and be it.

1101
00:51:30,989 --> 00:51:32,537
You're the warrior, man.
You are the warrior.

1102
00:51:32,561 --> 00:51:34,164
Come on. Get in there.
Get in there.

1103
00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:36,160
Yeah, boy. Yeah, Shauny!

1104
00:51:36,295 --> 00:51:37,729
Big Shaun!

1105
00:51:39,462 --> 00:51:40,771
Damn it!

1106
00:51:40,907 --> 00:51:43,368
Okay, so that's beer pong?

1107
00:51:43,503 --> 00:51:45,335
It's not for the faint of heart.

1108
00:51:47,174 --> 00:51:48,744
Oh.

1109
00:51:48,879 --> 00:51:50,206
Let's go.

1110
00:51:50,341 --> 00:51:51,413
Yeah?

1111
00:51:52,247 --> 00:51:53,373
Couple against couple?

1112
00:51:53,509 --> 00:51:54,612
Really?

1113
00:51:54,747 --> 00:51:56,187
Mm-hmm.

1114
00:51:56,322 --> 00:51:58,285
And-and not beer. Arrack.

1115
00:51:58,420 --> 00:51:59,620
- Arrack. Fine, let's go.
- Oh.

1116
00:51:59,716 --> 00:52:01,783
That's not a good idea.

1117
00:52:01,919 --> 00:52:03,026
The setup is important.

1118
00:52:03,161 --> 00:52:04,292
That's it. All right.

1119
00:52:04,428 --> 00:52:05,757
- Give me a practice.
- All right.

1120
00:52:05,892 --> 00:52:06,974
Okay, you're gonna need it.
Ugh.

1121
00:52:06,998 --> 00:52:08,065
Okay, watch your dad.

1122
00:52:08,201 --> 00:52:09,698
Practice.
Just a practice. Boom.

1123
00:52:09,833 --> 00:52:11,024
Boom.

1124
00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:12,600
Wait, what was that?
Whoa.

1125
00:52:12,735 --> 00:52:14,174
It's a... Uh, I got to stretch.
I got to stretch.

1126
00:52:14,198 --> 00:52:15,680
Hang on. I got to stretch.
I got to stretch!

1127
00:52:15,704 --> 00:52:17,176
- Give me a chance.
- Remember the old days.

1128
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:18,550
The old way. -I got it.
All right, here we go.

1129
00:52:18,574 --> 00:52:19,881
- The old ways. Come on.
- You got it.

1130
00:52:19,905 --> 00:52:20,990
Uh, can we get something
a little more

1131

age-appropriate for these two?

1132

Something old-school?

1133
00:52:23,676 --> 00:52:24,873
Focus, really. Don't blow it.

1134
00:52:25,008 --> 00:52:26,408

Did you tell him
you don't like surprises?

1228
00:56:17,076 --> 00:56:18,549
Oh, my gosh.
He surprises me so much

1229
00:56:18,684 --> 00:56:20,683
it's almost not a surprise
when he surprises me.

1230
00:56:20,818 --> 00:56:23,444
Georgia? It's me. It's Paul.
Okay. Wait. I...

1231
00:56:23,579 --> 00:56:25,883
I'm sneaking around. Distract him.
What? What?

1232
00:56:26,019 --> 00:56:27,523
- Distract him!
- You distract him.

1233
00:56:27,658 --> 00:56:29,526
Georgia, open the door.
Fuck!

1234
00:56:30,523 --> 00:56:31,821
Hey, Paul.

1235
00:56:31,956 --> 00:56:34,295
David, uh, I thought this was...

1236
00:56:34,431 --> 00:56:35,464
- Georgia's room?
- Yeah.

1237
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:37,295
No, it's my room.
That's her room.

1238
00:56:37,430 --> 00:56:39,075
This is my room. Hi, sweetie.
I thought I heard you. -Hi.

1239
00:56:39,099 --> 00:56:40,902
- In that room.
- Which is my room, this room.

1240
00:56:41,037 --> 00:56:43,115
- But I thought the guy said...
- No, we changed rooms.

1241
00:56:43,139 --> 00:56:45,459
- So that this could be my room.
- It's a much better room.

1242
00:56:45,510 --> 00:56:47,203
- Yeah.
- Oh, great. C-Can I see it?

1243
00:56:47,338 --> 00:56:49,471
Yes, but first...
Oh, baby, do you mind?

1244
00:56:49,606 --> 00:56:52,174
Could you just get me
a great big bucket of coffee?

1245
00:56:52,309 --> 00:56:53,469
Yeah, yeah. Anything for you.

1246
00:56:57,552 --> 00:56:59,215
You've been doing yoga.

1247
00:57:00,853 --> 00:57:02,486
No, I just like the pants.

1248
00:57:09,158 --> 00:57:11,396
Quick, we're changing rooms!

1249
00:57:11,531 --> 00:57:13,669
Ooh! Shit. Ooh!

1250
00:57:15,139 --> 00:57:16,603
Okay. Ooh.

1251
00:57:16,739 --> 00:57:18,536
<i>If I had hesitated</i>

1252
00:57:18,671 --> 00:57:20,708
just one second...

1253
00:57:20,844 --> 00:57:22,870
Well, let's just say
there's 170 souls

1254
00:57:23,006 --> 00:57:24,880
that are lucky I didn't.

1255
00:57:25,016 --> 00:57:26,249
And me.

1256
00:57:26,384 --> 00:57:28,077
So 171?
Hey.

1257
00:57:28,212 --> 00:57:29,576
- Where have you guys been?
- Oh.

1258
00:57:29,712 --> 00:57:31,193
- Did you see Paul's here?
- He's literally standing

1259
00:57:31,217 --> 00:57:32,917
- right next to us.
- So, what's the plan?

1260
00:57:33,053 --> 00:57:34,382
Uh, I was thinking
we could visit

1261
00:57:34,517 --> 00:57:35,877
the island of Nusa Penida.
Hmm.

1262
00:57:35,925 --> 00:57:37,423
Best place on Earth
to watch a sunset.

1263
00:57:37,558 --> 00:57:39,091
That sounds great.

1264
00:57:39,227 --> 00:57:41,169
Now, I've been reading
in the guidebooks about, uh,

1265
00:57:41,193 --> 00:57:43,465
visiting the temple
at Tanah Lot?

1266
00:57:43,600 --> 00:57:44,929
Uh, I don't think that's, uh...

1267
00:57:45,065 --> 00:57:46,961
Okay, why don't I get us
some cabs, okay?

1268
00:57:47,096 --> 00:57:48,802
Get us a couple cabs!

1269
00:57:48,937 --> 00:57:51,399
I think Nusa Penida
would be better.

1270
00:57:51,534 --> 00:57:53,368
We'll do that right after
Tanah Lot, okay?

1271
00:57:54,845 --> 00:57:57,478
Hi. Hey, do you know
where Tanah Lot is?

1272
00:57:57,614 --> 00:57:59,373
It's a temple.
Yeah.

1273
00:57:59,509 --> 00:58:01,381
Here we go, guys!

1274
00:58:01,516 --> 00:58:03,049
Come on! Come on!

1275
00:58:22,770 --> 00:58:24,636
You okay?

1276
00:58:24,771 --> 00:58:26,139
We shouldn't be here.

1277
00:58:26,275 --> 00:58:27,670
Why?

1278
00:58:27,806 --> 00:58:29,573
Looks amazing.

1279
00:58:29,708 --> 00:58:31,407
It's cursed.

1280
00:58:31,543 --> 00:58:34,441
Tradition says any unwed couple
that visits Tanah Lot

1281
00:58:34,577 --> 00:58:36,818
will never have happiness
in marriage.

1282
00:58:38,317 --> 00:58:41,356
Well, my dad couldn't
have known that.

1283
00:58:41,491 --> 00:58:43,587
I'm sure you're right.

1284
00:58:43,722 --> 00:58:45,259
Well, hey.

1285
00:58:45,395 --> 00:58:46,922
Let's just go.

1286
00:58:47,058 --> 00:58:49,591
- You sure?
- Yeah.

1287
00:58:49,727 --> 00:58:53,494
Bet it would take a lot more
than a curse to mess us up.

1288
00:58:53,629 --> 00:58:56,006
Maybe other couples
who aren't so lucky.

1289
00:59:09,349 --> 00:59:11,130
Apparently, these are
called the snake caves.

1290
00:59:11,154 --> 00:59:14,051
Oh, my God. It feels so good
to get out of the sun.

1291
00:59:14,187 --> 00:59:17,060
Feel like my hangover
has a hangover.

1292
00:59:19,991 --> 00:59:21,359
What are you doing?

1293
00:59:21,495 --> 00:59:23,064
Georgia?

1294
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:24,628
Yes?

1295
00:59:24,763 --> 00:59:26,830
I love you.

1296
00:59:26,966 --> 00:59:30,566
You are gorgeous and kind.

1297
00:59:31,968 --> 00:59:33,337
Funny and smart.

1298
00:59:33,472 --> 00:59:35,232
You're everything
I could ever want and need.

1299
00:59:36,175 --> 00:59:38,873
Will you marry me?

1300
00:59:39,008 --> 00:59:41,018
Oh. Whoa, Paul.

1301
00:59:41,153 --> 00:59:42,983
I'm so...

1302
00:59:43,118 --> 00:59:46,484
I'm so touched and...
and nauseous right now.

1303
00:59:46,619 --> 00:59:48,659
Um...

1304
00:59:49,724 --> 00:59:52,491
Uh, how do I put this?

1305
00:59:52,626 --> 00:59:54,060
Um, David...

1306
00:59:55,835 --> 00:59:58,530
David spent the night
in my room last night.

1307
00:59:58,665 --> 01:00:00,869
I'm sorry.

1308
01:00:05,673 --> 01:00:07,273
I know.

1309
01:00:07,409 --> 01:00:08,609
Oh.

1310
01:00:08,745 --> 01:00:10,609
Men don't wear yoga pants, uh,

1311
01:00:10,745 --> 01:00:12,247
even when they do yoga.

1312
01:00:12,382 --> 01:00:13,573
Oh. Okay.

1313
01:00:13,709 --> 01:00:15,280
I mean, oh, my God,
nothing happened.

1314
01:00:15,415 --> 01:00:17,554
It's not like that. It would
just never be like that.

1315
01:00:17,689 --> 01:00:19,952
- Stop it. Stop it.
- Okay. Okay.

1316
01:00:20,088 --> 01:00:22,623
- I trust you.
- Okay. Thank you.

1317
01:00:22,759 --> 01:00:24,928
Thank you.

1318
01:00:25,064 --> 01:00:27,222
I...

1319
01:00:27,357 --> 01:00:30,232
I trust you.

1320
01:00:30,367 --> 01:00:32,359
Yeah. Thank you.

1321
01:00:34,098 --> 01:00:35,970
Why are you being weird?

1322
01:00:36,105 --> 01:00:38,370
I think maybe
I just got bit by something.

1323
01:00:38,506 --> 01:00:39,506
Really?

1324
01:00:39,611 --> 01:00:40,908
Oh, a snake.

1325
01:00:42,948 --> 01:00:45,049
Oh... oh, that's no good.

1326
01:00:45,184 --> 01:00:46,944
Oh, shit.

1327
01:00:47,080 --> 01:00:48,251
Oh. Oh, my God.

1328
01:00:48,387 --> 01:00:49,816
Oh, my God.

1329
01:00:49,952 --> 01:00:51,314
- It's wet.
- Uh, where is it?

1330
01:00:51,450 --> 01:00:54,415
Oh, my God, there it is!
Um, what do we do?

1331
01:00:54,551 --> 01:00:56,031
- What do we do? Uh...
- Do something.

1332
01:00:56,085 --> 01:00:57,789
Okay. Um...

1333
01:00:57,925 --> 01:00:59,724
- Anything.
- Uh...

1334
01:00:59,860 --> 01:01:01,226
Okay.

1335
01:01:08,031 --> 01:01:09,470
You're amazing.

1336
01:01:09,605 --> 01:01:11,103
I think...

1337
01:01:11,238 --> 01:01:13,508
I think I got most of it.

1338
01:01:13,644 --> 01:01:15,713
I think I got most of it.

1339
01:01:17,077 --> 01:01:18,811
Well, he will experience

1340
01:01:18,946 --> 01:01:20,818
some numbness in his extremities

1341
01:01:20,953 --> 01:01:23,749
and a little wooziness
from the pills I just gave him,

1342
01:01:23,884 --> 01:01:25,754
but no lasting effect.

1343
01:01:25,890 --> 01:01:27,355
Not like getting bit
by a dolphin.

1344
01:01:27,490 --> 01:01:28,522
All right.

1345
01:01:28,657 --> 01:01:31,084
You saved my life.

1346
01:01:31,219 --> 01:01:33,597
I really didn't.

1347
01:01:33,733 --> 01:01:36,192
We just heard.
What an adventure.

1348
01:01:36,327 --> 01:01:37,863
Are you okay?
I'm okay.

1349
01:01:37,998 --> 01:01:39,865
Thanks to my warrior queen.

1350
01:01:40,001 --> 01:01:42,267
- My Georgia.
- Okay.

1351
01:01:49,441 --> 01:01:51,377
- What are you talking about?
- Hmm?

1352
01:01:51,513 --> 01:01:53,382
Snakes.

1353
01:01:53,517 --> 01:01:54,617
Hmm.

1354
01:01:54,752 --> 01:01:56,149
We should let him sleep.

1355
01:01:56,284 --> 01:01:58,712
He's going to be fine,
but don't do that again.

1356
01:01:58,848 --> 01:02:00,457
All right.
DAVID andLet's go.

1357
01:02:00,592 --> 01:02:02,351
- Yeah.
- Oh. Okay. -Okay.

1358
01:02:02,487 --> 01:02:04,321
We'll let you get
some rest, okay?

1359
01:02:04,457 --> 01:02:05,937
But don't worry.
I'll stay right here.

1360
01:02:06,027 --> 01:02:07,895
Oh, oh, oh, you remember that

1361
01:02:08,030 --> 01:02:09,310
important thing
that I asked you?

1362
01:02:09,368 --> 01:02:11,466
Oh, yeah. Yep.

1363
01:02:11,601 --> 01:02:13,302
What'd he ask you?

1364
01:02:13,438 --> 01:02:15,333
To marry him.

1365
01:02:17,170 --> 01:02:19,232
- That's wonderful!
- What?

1366
01:02:19,368 --> 01:02:21,339
Maybe not for everybody.

1367
01:02:21,475 --> 01:02:23,203
Sorry, I get that
he's nice and all, but...

1368
01:02:23,339 --> 01:02:24,641
What's wrong with nice?

1369
01:02:25,644 --> 01:02:27,850
Uh, only that after
a couple more years of it,

1370
01:02:27,986 --> 01:02:29,850
you'll be begging
to watch paint dry.

1371
01:02:29,985 --> 01:02:31,347
- Excuse me?
- I mean, Mom,

1372
01:02:31,483 --> 01:02:33,747
you're-you're so amazing
and educated,

1373
01:02:33,882 --> 01:02:35,824
tough, smart and beautiful,
but you're...

1374
01:02:35,960 --> 01:02:37,993
you're never
your best self with him.

1375
01:02:38,128 --> 01:02:41,430
But yeah, he's kind
and he's got those eyes,

1376
01:02:41,566 --> 01:02:43,801
but it's not enough.

1377
01:02:45,696 --> 01:02:48,366
Being loved is not the same
as loving.

1378
01:02:49,833 --> 01:02:53,207
Plus, the who-whole
surprising thing?

1379
01:02:54,210 --> 01:02:56,071
It's actually just
a curtain between us,

1380
01:02:56,207 --> 01:02:58,178
so I heard all of that.

1381
01:03:17,897 --> 01:03:19,903
I feel bad.

1382
01:03:21,004 --> 01:03:23,764
Well, she didn't say
she said yes.

1383
01:03:26,008 --> 01:03:27,878
How would you feel if she did?

1384
01:03:29,511 --> 01:03:31,942
Like hearing an old friend
you barely talk to anymore

1385
01:03:32,078 --> 01:03:33,946
is getting married.

1386
01:03:34,082 --> 01:03:36,214
You're happy for them, but...

1387
01:03:36,349 --> 01:03:38,581
you don't feel the need
to buy a gift.

1388
01:03:40,222 --> 01:03:42,893
Since when were you guys
old friends?

1389
01:03:44,626 --> 01:03:46,121
Ah.

1390
01:03:46,257 --> 01:03:47,759
That's the way it goes.

1391
01:03:47,894 --> 01:03:50,227
Stuff happens...

1392
01:03:50,362 --> 01:03:52,870
things change, and you move on.

1393
01:03:56,607 --> 01:03:58,568
Just move on.

1394
01:04:10,321 --> 01:04:12,417
<i>She doesn't get
to tell me what to do.</i>

1395
01:04:12,552 --> 01:04:14,453
Can you believe it?
I'm sorry, baby.

1396
01:04:14,588 --> 01:04:17,287
I'm a little woozy.
Am I supposed to believe it?

1397
01:04:17,422 --> 01:04:19,653
- No.
- No. Right, I can't.

1398
01:04:19,789 --> 01:04:21,325
I know you're thinking
I'm a hypocrite.

1399
01:04:21,460 --> 01:04:24,164
- Am I?
- And you're probably right.

1400
01:04:24,299 --> 01:04:26,200
- Oh. Good.
- I mean, who are we to say

1401
01:04:26,335 --> 01:04:28,698
that Lily doesn't know
what's best for herself?

1402
01:04:28,833 --> 01:04:31,302
And if she does, if she's
truly definitively certain

1403
01:04:31,438 --> 01:04:33,600
that she loves
and is loved, then...

1404
01:04:33,735 --> 01:04:35,645
Oh, David is with them.

1405
01:04:35,780 --> 01:04:37,275
David is with Gede and Lily now.

1406
01:04:37,410 --> 01:04:38,772
Oh, right,
so he can break them up.

1407
01:04:38,908 --> 01:04:40,715
No, I don't want him
to break them up.

1408
01:04:40,850 --> 01:04:42,185
Damn this medication.

1409
01:04:43,512 --> 01:04:45,047
I have to do something.

1410
01:04:45,182 --> 01:04:46,723
Take this.

1411
01:04:46,858 --> 01:04:48,485
I'm sorry.

1412
01:04:48,620 --> 01:04:50,323
I'm sorry.
This will help you sleep.

1413
01:04:51,754 --> 01:04:52,754
All right. Cool.

1414
01:04:52,860 --> 01:04:54,295
Feel better.

1415
01:04:54,430 --> 01:04:56,831
You know, I'm a highly trained
commercial pilot.

1416
01:04:56,967 --> 01:04:59,127
I can go weeks without sleep.

1417
01:05:16,712 --> 01:05:18,415
The best place on Earth.

1418
01:05:18,551 --> 01:05:20,648
GEDE Well, to be fair,

1419
01:05:20,784 --> 01:05:22,584
I haven't been
to all the other places.

1420
01:05:22,719 --> 01:05:24,853
Your mother's gonna
be so jealous.

1421
01:05:24,988 --> 01:05:27,530
I'll send her a picture
as soon as I get a signal.

1422
01:05:27,665 --> 01:05:29,329
No need.

1423
01:05:36,238 --> 01:05:38,775
Mom. Hey.

1424
01:05:38,910 --> 01:05:40,435
Hey, I'm so sorry about before.

1425
01:05:40,571 --> 01:05:42,507
I guess I was just surprised.

1426
01:05:42,642 --> 01:05:44,243
Of course your choices
are your choices.

1427
01:05:44,379 --> 01:05:47,314
Well, I haven't made
any choices yet.

1428
01:05:49,047 --> 01:05:50,111
Oh.

1429
01:05:50,246 --> 01:05:51,415
Okay.

1430
01:05:51,551 --> 01:05:52,551
Hi, gents.
Mm.

1431
01:05:52,580 --> 01:05:54,457
Is, uh, Paul okay?

1432
01:05:54,593 --> 01:05:55,723
He's sleeping.

1433
01:05:55,858 --> 01:05:57,384
How can you tell?

1434
01:05:57,520 --> 01:05:59,557
God, look at this view.

1435
01:06:00,931 --> 01:06:02,725
LILY Yeah.

1436
01:06:04,866 --> 01:06:06,729
Is that my boat?

1437
01:06:08,499 --> 01:06:10,535
Is it drifting?

1438
01:06:11,538 --> 01:06:13,235
Nah, it's just rising
with the tide.

1439
01:06:13,371 --> 01:06:14,704
It's floating away.

1440
01:06:14,840 --> 01:06:16,744
- You did tie my boat off?
- Yeah, I tied it.

1441
01:06:16,879 --> 01:06:18,873
Tied it to a log.

1442
01:06:21,850 --> 01:06:23,779
That's not good.

1443
01:06:28,557 --> 01:06:30,423
How far are we
from the nearest village?

1444
01:06:30,558 --> 01:06:33,392
Too far to walk.
Plus, it's getting dark.

1445
01:06:33,527 --> 01:06:35,458
I still can't get a signal.

1446
01:06:35,594 --> 01:06:37,262
What are we gonna do?

1447
01:06:37,397 --> 01:06:38,827
Camp here for the night.

1448
01:06:38,962 --> 01:06:41,104
A lot of people come
to see the sunrise,

1449
01:06:41,239 --> 01:06:43,301
so we can get a ride
in time for our wedding.

1450
01:06:43,436 --> 01:06:44,732
Is that gonna work?

1451
01:06:44,868 --> 01:06:47,066
Yeah, with hours to spare.

1452
01:06:47,202 --> 01:06:49,446
Uh, Georgia, can you and Lily
build a fire?

1453
01:06:49,581 --> 01:06:51,137
Uh, on it, yeah.

1454
01:06:51,272 --> 01:06:53,979
Mr. Cotton, you and I
will track down some food.

1455
01:06:54,115 --> 01:06:55,510
Hmm. What kind of food?

1456
01:06:55,645 --> 01:06:57,681
I've seen some wild pigs around.

1457
01:06:58,985 --> 01:07:00,781
We'll have to make spears.

1458
01:07:00,917 --> 01:07:02,816
Hmm.

1459
01:07:02,952 --> 01:07:05,291
What? I can hunt.
I can be a hunter.

1460
01:07:05,427 --> 01:07:08,428
How do you make
that part pointier?

1461
01:07:09,795 --> 01:07:11,661
I am impressed with this situation...
Yeah.

1462
01:07:11,796 --> 01:07:13,460
And I have, uh,
matches in my bag.

1463
01:07:13,596 --> 01:07:15,128
Okay.

1464
01:07:15,263 --> 01:07:16,703
You know,
I don't think I've actually

1465
01:07:16,834 --> 01:07:18,194
successfully started
a fire before.

1466
01:07:18,302 --> 01:07:19,933
Oh, really?

1467
01:07:20,068 --> 01:07:21,671
What about
your eighth birthday, hmm?

1468
01:07:21,806 --> 01:07:24,376
Oh, well, never on purpose.

1469
01:07:24,512 --> 01:07:26,543
Oh, God.
We had some good parties.

1470
01:07:26,679 --> 01:07:28,217
Do you remember
your tenth birthday?

1471
01:07:28,353 --> 01:07:29,989
Mom? -And the clown came
and he was drunk?

1472
01:07:30,013 --> 01:07:32,848
No, he was a magician, but he was...
Mom.

1473
01:07:47,670 --> 01:07:50,073
DAVID
All right. You're the closest.

1474
01:07:50,209 --> 01:07:53,006
I think it's closer
to you than me.

1475
01:07:53,142 --> 01:07:54,639
Okay. Hey.

1476
01:07:55,637 --> 01:07:58,579
On my count. Okay?

1477
01:07:58,715 --> 01:08:00,447
One.

1478
01:08:02,378 --> 01:08:03,579
Three.

1479
01:08:03,714 --> 01:08:05,588
Dad!

1480
01:08:07,215 --> 01:08:09,583
What are you doing?
We absolutely had it.

1481
01:08:09,718 --> 01:08:11,324
I cannot believe you.

1482
01:08:11,460 --> 01:08:12,820
You're the one
that scared it away.

1483
01:08:12,856 --> 01:08:14,396
That is not what
I'm talking about.

1484
01:08:14,532 --> 01:08:16,828
- What are you talking about?
- She found the rings.

1485
01:08:16,964 --> 01:08:18,100
Really?

1486
01:08:18,236 --> 01:08:19,096
That's great. Where?

1487
01:08:19,232 --> 01:08:20,328
In Mom's bag.

1488
01:08:20,463 --> 01:08:21,768
I knew it.

1489
01:08:21,903 --> 01:08:23,540
What?

1490
01:08:23,675 --> 01:08:25,033
I knew it.

1491
01:08:25,169 --> 01:08:26,880
And she obviously wasn't
working alone, because...

1492
01:08:26,904 --> 01:08:28,575
- Wait, what?
- You left it in the bag?

1493
01:08:28,710 --> 01:08:30,381
Wait, wait, wait.
Wh-What do you mean, you knew?

1494
01:08:30,405 --> 01:08:32,019
What was I supposed to do with them?
Throw it away.

1495
01:08:32,043 --> 01:08:33,558
Where? -I'm sorry.
I couldn't tell you.

1496
01:08:33,582 --> 01:08:34,276
In the trash, in the ocean,
anywhere but...

1497
01:08:34,411 --> 01:08:35,780
Oh, my God.

1498
01:08:35,916 --> 01:08:37,528
Can you just stop talking
about the rings, please?

1499
01:08:37,552 --> 01:08:39,212
I cannot believe
that this is happening.

1500
01:08:39,347 --> 01:08:41,162
My own parents have been trying
to sabotage my wedding,

1501
01:08:41,186 --> 01:08:42,865
and my fiancé knew about it
and didn't bother to tell me.

1502
01:08:42,889 --> 01:08:43,971
We were just trying to do
what's best for you.

1503
01:08:43,995 --> 01:08:45,524
Yeah, but you had no respect

1504
01:08:45,659 --> 01:08:47,428
for my opinion
of what that might be.

1505
01:08:49,265 --> 01:08:51,529
You're just like all parents,

1506
01:08:51,665 --> 01:08:52,985
acting like
you're giving your kid

1507
01:08:53,063 --> 01:08:54,503
this great advice
for their own good,

1508
01:08:54,537 --> 01:08:56,131
but all you're really doing
is talking

1509
01:08:56,267 --> 01:08:58,209
to your young, dumb selves,
trying to rewrite the past

1510
01:08:58,233 --> 01:09:00,135
and not do whatever you did
25 years ago.

1511
01:09:00,271 --> 01:09:02,874
- That's absolutely not true.
- That's a hundred percent true.

1512
01:09:04,044 --> 01:09:08,413
And I can't tell you how much
I wish someone had been able

1513
01:09:08,548 --> 01:09:10,980
to get through to me back then,

1514
01:09:11,115 --> 01:09:13,916
stop me from making the
greatest mistake of my life.

1515
01:09:16,954 --> 01:09:19,020
I'm the greatest mistake
of your life?

1516
01:09:20,358 --> 01:09:22,430
Not you. Me.

1517
01:09:23,691 --> 01:09:25,433
I'm the mistake.

1518
01:09:30,367 --> 01:09:31,967
Hey.

1519
01:09:51,920 --> 01:09:53,626
Do you think we've lost her?

1520
01:09:56,165 --> 01:09:58,158
She's pretty pissed.

1521
01:10:01,462 --> 01:10:03,933
I'll talk to her.
I'll tell her it was my idea.

1522
01:10:05,108 --> 01:10:06,971
I talked you into it.

1523
01:10:08,141 --> 01:10:11,413
And if I'd listened to you,
we wouldn't have done it.

1524
01:10:13,609 --> 01:10:15,483
She'll be fine.

1525
01:10:21,124 --> 01:10:22,589
You weren't a mistake.

1526
01:10:25,324 --> 01:10:26,791
You weren't.

1527
01:10:28,425 --> 01:10:30,504
It's been the story for years
that you were the one to blame.

1528
01:10:30,528 --> 01:10:32,698
It's not true.

1529
01:10:35,531 --> 01:10:37,098
I...

1530
01:10:38,274 --> 01:10:40,871
was loving being a mom.

1531
01:10:43,143 --> 01:10:44,974
But I...

1532
01:10:45,109 --> 01:10:47,717
started to feel like
I was losing who I was,

1533
01:10:47,852 --> 01:10:49,715
and I thought...

1534
01:10:49,850 --> 01:10:53,418
if I stayed with you,
maybe one day I would...

1535
01:10:53,553 --> 01:10:56,051
not recognize myself at all.

1536
01:11:00,493 --> 01:11:02,928
That was the mistake.

1537
01:11:03,064 --> 01:11:04,261
Not you.

1538
01:11:16,380 --> 01:11:18,539
You should've told me.

1539
01:11:20,477 --> 01:11:23,353
Well, your dad thinks
you deserve better than me.

1540
01:11:23,488 --> 01:11:26,182
My dad thinks I deserve
better than anyone.

1541
01:11:26,318 --> 01:11:28,050
So do I.

1542
01:11:30,858 --> 01:11:34,364
You gave up a lot
to stay on this island.

1543
01:11:35,530 --> 01:11:37,763
And you know I understand that.

1544
01:11:39,597 --> 01:11:41,536
But what about me?

1545
01:11:42,705 --> 01:11:46,233
In a year from now,
ten years from now...

1546
01:11:48,005 --> 01:11:50,039
will I still be enough for you?

1547
01:11:52,116 --> 01:11:54,043
Are you kidding me?

1548
01:11:55,748 --> 01:11:58,144
Hey, we're sitting here,

1549
01:11:58,279 --> 01:12:01,448
and there's a moon
and a waterfall.

1550
01:12:01,584 --> 01:12:03,950
I'm in the most beautiful place
I've ever been in my life,

1551
01:12:04,086 --> 01:12:06,121
and all I can look at is you.

1552
01:12:09,368 --> 01:12:11,397
This isn't some summer thing

1553
01:12:11,532 --> 01:12:13,568
with a beginning and an end.

1554
01:12:15,764 --> 01:12:17,565
This is forever.

1555
01:12:48,831 --> 01:12:50,167
Morning.

1556
01:12:50,303 --> 01:12:51,535
Morning.

1557
01:12:51,671 --> 01:12:53,374
How'd you sleep?

1558
01:12:53,509 --> 01:12:55,973
You know, outside.

1559
01:12:58,013 --> 01:13:00,477
I think this is
my new favorite place on Earth.

1560
01:13:00,612 --> 01:13:02,515
Mm.

1561
01:13:02,650 --> 01:13:04,685
- Close second for me.
- Yeah?

1562
01:13:05,683 --> 01:13:07,888
What beats it?

1563
01:13:08,024 --> 01:13:09,850
Mm. Aw.

1564
01:13:09,985 --> 01:13:11,356
Our place by the lake.

1565
01:13:11,492 --> 01:13:12,790
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1566
01:13:12,925 --> 01:13:15,063
I still go there
from time to time.

1567
01:13:15,198 --> 01:13:16,397
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

1568
01:13:16,532 --> 01:13:17,994
God, what did they build there?

1569
01:13:18,129 --> 01:13:20,498
Please don't say
some hideous McMansion.

1570
01:13:20,633 --> 01:13:22,570
No, it's still vacant.

1571
01:13:22,706 --> 01:13:25,640
Huh. I wonder why nobody
ever developed it.

1572
01:13:27,442 --> 01:13:29,479
'Cause I still own it.

1573
01:13:33,349 --> 01:13:35,915
I meant to sell it.

1574
01:13:36,050 --> 01:13:38,785
Took an offer once,
but I couldn't do it. I just...

1575
01:13:40,883 --> 01:13:42,690
I didn't want to.

1576
01:13:49,058 --> 01:13:50,923
You-you got a... Mm, yeah.

1577
01:13:51,058 --> 01:13:53,129
An entire forest.

1578
01:14:19,396 --> 01:14:20,725
Oh, no.

1579
01:14:20,860 --> 01:14:23,091
- No, no. No.
- No, no.

1580
01:14:23,227 --> 01:14:24,930
- Just... Oh!
- Nope. No, no.

1581
01:14:25,065 --> 01:14:26,580
- Oh, yeah, that would not work.
- That's bad.

1582
01:14:26,604 --> 01:14:28,099
That's not gonna work.

1583
01:14:28,234 --> 01:14:29,517
It's because we're in
this romantic place and...

1584
01:14:29,541 --> 01:14:30,881
No, it's the whole thing
with Lily...

1585
01:14:30,905 --> 01:14:32,145
- everything is heightened.
- Yeah.

1586
01:14:32,169 --> 01:14:33,477
I mean, maybe if
we were younger...

1587
01:14:33,501 --> 01:14:35,040
- We're not.
- Uh, which we're not.

1588
01:14:35,176 --> 01:14:36,414
We know better. We know better.
So, good, good, good.

1589
01:14:36,438 --> 01:14:37,877
We can do better.
Good. Good. Great.

1590
01:14:38,013 --> 01:14:39,683
- Good and great.
- Good and great. You know what?

1591
01:14:39,707 --> 01:14:41,522
- Hey. Hey, hey, hey.
- Good and great. Hey, hey, hey.

1592
01:14:41,546 --> 01:14:42,727
Give me your hand. Give me your hand.
What? Oh.

1593
01:14:42,751 --> 01:14:43,615
- Okay.
- Just like that. Okay.

1594
01:14:43,751 --> 01:14:44,783
Mom. Dad.
Oh! Yes?

1595
01:14:44,918 --> 01:14:45,548
- Hey. Hi.
- We're your parents.

1596
01:14:45,684 --> 01:14:47,524
We got rides.

1597
01:14:48,591 --> 01:14:51,126
Well, well, well. Hello again.

1598
01:14:51,262 --> 01:14:53,325
Or should I say, "Ciao"?

1599
01:15:04,472 --> 01:15:07,405
♪ Oh, babe ♪

1600
01:15:09,103 --> 01:15:10,811
♪ I love you. ♪

1601
01:15:20,223 --> 01:15:22,182
Thanks. Hey.

1602
01:15:22,317 --> 01:15:24,591
Georgia, hey.
Baby!

1603
01:15:24,727 --> 01:15:27,023
I was so worried.

1604
01:15:27,159 --> 01:15:29,424
Oh.
We're fine. We're fine.

1605
01:15:29,559 --> 01:15:31,667
I just need the world's
longest bath. How are you?

1606
01:15:31,802 --> 01:15:33,362
You were right about getting
some sleep.

1607
01:15:33,438 --> 01:15:35,034
I can almost move both my legs.

1608
01:15:35,169 --> 01:15:37,237
And look, one functioning arm.

1609
01:15:38,240 --> 01:15:40,244
- Where have you guys been?
- It's a long story. It's...

1610
01:15:40,268 --> 01:15:42,168
Our boat drifted out to sea.

1611
01:15:42,303 --> 01:15:44,638
That's not that long of a story.

1612
01:15:44,773 --> 01:15:46,973
Yeah, well, it felt like
a long story if you were there.

1613
01:15:47,014 --> 01:15:48,482
- Hey. Where are you going?
- Lily.

1614
01:15:48,617 --> 01:15:50,444
To Wren's room to get ready,

1615
01:15:50,579 --> 01:15:53,018
because this afternoon,
I'm getting married.

1616
01:15:54,318 --> 01:15:56,017
You can either
get on board with that

1617
01:15:56,152 --> 01:15:58,358
or have a nice flight home.

1618
01:15:58,494 --> 01:16:00,157
Lily.

1619
01:16:24,385 --> 01:16:26,245
Hey.

1620
01:16:26,381 --> 01:16:28,724
- Your tuxedo, sir.
- Oh.

1621
01:16:33,130 --> 01:16:34,323
There.

1622
01:16:35,332 --> 01:16:36,394
Are you okay, sir?

1623
01:16:36,529 --> 01:16:37,697
Yeah.

1624
01:16:37,832 --> 01:16:39,702
Everything is clearly terrific.

1625
01:16:54,982 --> 01:16:56,681
Surprise!

1626
01:16:56,816 --> 01:16:57,848
Why would you do that?

1627
01:16:57,983 --> 01:16:59,215
- I got us brunch.
- Okay.

1628
01:16:59,350 --> 01:17:01,453
How long have you been out here?

1629
01:17:01,588 --> 01:17:02,692
Oh, not so long.

1630
01:17:03,691 --> 01:17:05,426
Oh. Oh, is it cold?

1631
01:17:05,562 --> 01:17:07,024
Oh, I-I wasn't sure how...

1632
01:17:07,160 --> 01:17:08,688
how long you would stay
in the bath.

1633
01:17:08,823 --> 01:17:11,228
Oof. I'm gonna be having
that panic attack all day.

1634
01:17:11,364 --> 01:17:12,928
Oh, oh, eat something.
Eat somethi...

1635
01:17:13,064 --> 01:17:14,462
Well, maybe not the eggs.

1636
01:17:14,597 --> 01:17:16,973
They're a little congealed.
But first...

1637
01:17:17,108 --> 01:17:18,602
What?

1638
01:17:18,737 --> 01:17:20,440
Oh.

1639
01:17:20,576 --> 01:17:22,938
Take two.

1640
01:17:23,074 --> 01:17:24,780
- Georgia.
- Yes?

1641
01:17:26,384 --> 01:17:28,549
I-I love you.

1642
01:17:28,684 --> 01:17:31,116
You are gorgeous and kind...

1643
01:17:31,251 --> 01:17:33,316
Okay, I... You don't
have to kneel this time.

1644
01:17:33,452 --> 01:17:34,898
- Oh, you want me to stand?
- Yeah, I do. I...

1645
01:17:34,922 --> 01:17:36,988
- Oh! Oh!
- Oh! Oh, come on!

1646
01:17:37,124 --> 01:17:38,725
Are you okay? I'm s...

1647
01:17:38,860 --> 01:17:40,426
I'm-I'm gonna get you some ice.

1648
01:17:40,562 --> 01:17:41,922
No, I'm fine.

1649
01:17:42,057 --> 01:17:43,123
You're so brave.

1650
01:17:43,259 --> 01:17:44,498
God.

1651
01:17:44,633 --> 01:17:47,235
Oh, my God, it hurts.

1652
01:17:49,774 --> 01:17:50,971
LILY <i>Stop crying.</i>

1653
01:17:51,968 --> 01:17:53,908
Why would I cry?

1654
01:17:54,044 --> 01:17:56,173
It's not like I'm losing
someone who's basically

1655
01:17:56,309 --> 01:17:59,005
a substitute for my entire
terrible family.

1656
01:18:00,979 --> 01:18:03,119
Is my mascara okay?

1657
01:18:03,254 --> 01:18:05,121
Uh, for a clown.

1658
01:18:05,256 --> 01:18:07,119
Let me help.

1659
01:18:08,792 --> 01:18:10,483
Do you remember
when we graduated?

1660
01:18:10,619 --> 01:18:13,758
Yes, because it was
two months ago.

1661
01:18:13,894 --> 01:18:15,197
Oh.

1662
01:18:17,597 --> 01:18:19,065
Mrs. C?

1663
01:18:20,102 --> 01:18:21,962
You're gonna have to
take it from here.

1664
01:18:22,098 --> 01:18:24,070
I just can't.

1665
01:18:29,642 --> 01:18:31,176
Hi.

1666
01:18:32,183 --> 01:18:33,750
Hi.

1667
01:18:41,192 --> 01:18:42,957
May I?

1668
01:18:50,433 --> 01:18:52,769
You lied to me.

1669
01:18:55,934 --> 01:18:57,701
I'm so, so sorry.

1670
01:18:59,369 --> 01:19:00,875
It turns out a parent will do

1671
01:19:01,010 --> 01:19:02,504
anything in the world
for their kid

1672
01:19:02,639 --> 01:19:05,705
except let them be
exactly who they are.

1673
01:19:08,479 --> 01:19:10,853
Your dad and I
were gonna be different.

1674
01:19:13,682 --> 01:19:15,825
We were gonna be
better than this.

1675
01:19:17,958 --> 01:19:20,060
I wanted to be better than this.

1676
01:19:25,801 --> 01:19:28,035
There's no one better, Mom.

1677
01:19:30,208 --> 01:19:31,907
No one.

1678
01:19:32,905 --> 01:19:34,976
Yes, there is.

1679
01:19:43,345 --> 01:19:45,679
Oh, sweetie. Love you.

1680
01:19:52,854 --> 01:19:54,626
Got to get you ready
for that wedding, huh?

1681
01:19:56,431 --> 01:19:59,330
You're kind of a mess right now.
I know.

1682
01:20:00,834 --> 01:20:02,901
Mm.

1683
01:20:03,037 --> 01:20:04,801
You're a mess. You're my mess.

1684
01:21:11,838 --> 01:21:14,602
Can you believe I didn't bring
anything to wear to a wedding?

1685
01:21:14,738 --> 01:21:16,770
There wasn't supposed
to be a wedding.

1686
01:21:18,177 --> 01:21:19,949
Doesn't look like a rental.

1687
01:21:21,411 --> 01:21:23,348
You clean up pretty good.

1688
01:21:30,352 --> 01:21:32,753
Okay.

1689
01:21:48,643 --> 01:21:50,974
Wow.

1690
01:21:51,109 --> 01:21:52,638
Look at our girl.

1691
01:21:52,773 --> 01:21:54,180
And free!

1692
01:21:54,315 --> 01:21:57,982
So young, so free, so sweaty.

1693
01:21:58,118 --> 01:22:00,388
So sweaty.

1694
01:22:00,523 --> 01:22:02,189
Yeah.

1695
01:23:23,607 --> 01:23:25,100
She is good.

1696
01:24:13,783 --> 01:24:16,322
And now for the final part

1697
01:24:16,458 --> 01:24:18,355
- of the ceremony.
- Thank you so much.

1698
01:24:18,490 --> 01:24:20,227
Gede will take the knife

1699
01:24:20,362 --> 01:24:23,658
and strike it
through this pandanus

1700
01:24:23,794 --> 01:24:28,164
to show he and Lily
will be ready

1701
01:24:28,299 --> 01:24:30,667
to live together.

1702
01:24:43,851 --> 01:24:45,011
Uh...

1703
01:24:50,157 --> 01:24:52,722
<i>Desa, kala, patra.</i>

1704
01:24:53,688 --> 01:24:56,863
Right place, right time,

1705
01:24:56,999 --> 01:24:58,860
right circumstance.

1706
01:25:00,137 --> 01:25:02,666
Sorry, but we don't have
all three.

1707
01:25:04,666 --> 01:25:07,867
Georgia, Mr. Cotton,

1708
01:25:08,002 --> 01:25:11,846
we needed your support,
your blessing,

1709
01:25:11,981 --> 01:25:14,007
and we don't have it.

1710
01:25:16,012 --> 01:25:18,687
When I push this knife
through this mat,

1711
01:25:18,823 --> 01:25:21,285
it is a declaration that

1712
01:25:21,420 --> 01:25:24,352
this poem of a person and me

1713
01:25:24,487 --> 01:25:26,360
are now a family.

1714
01:25:27,660 --> 01:25:29,693
We can't be a family
without you.

1715
01:25:31,825 --> 01:25:35,263
So I ask you, please,

1716
01:25:35,398 --> 01:25:37,773
for Lily and me,

1717
01:25:37,908 --> 01:25:41,034
or we will not marry.

1718
01:25:42,346 --> 01:25:44,708
You didn't want to run that
by me first?

1719
01:25:50,615 --> 01:25:52,881
You can do the hard stuff, too.

1720
01:25:58,024 --> 01:26:00,093
Um...

1721
01:26:00,228 --> 01:26:02,731
You don't need our blessing.

1722
01:26:02,867 --> 01:26:04,733
I mean, you have it.

1723
01:26:04,868 --> 01:26:07,060
It's here, but...

1724
01:26:09,239 --> 01:26:11,603
All you two really need
is each other.

1725
01:26:15,939 --> 01:26:17,642
If your mother and I
had listened

1726
01:26:17,777 --> 01:26:20,511
to her awful parents
or my dumb-ass friends,

1727
01:26:20,646 --> 01:26:22,975
then Lily wouldn't
be here at all,

1728
01:26:23,111 --> 01:26:25,650
and I think
we can all agree that

1729
01:26:25,785 --> 01:26:29,185
the world's a lot better place
with Lily in it.

1730
01:26:29,320 --> 01:26:33,119
So, uh...

1731
01:26:35,228 --> 01:26:37,156
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

1732
01:26:40,834 --> 01:26:42,997
I mean, your mother and I
are on your side.

1733
01:26:43,972 --> 01:26:46,103
Both of you.

1734
01:26:46,238 --> 01:26:47,972
Now and always.

1735
01:26:48,107 --> 01:26:49,905
Yeah.

1736
01:27:00,582 --> 01:27:02,687
Shall we?

1737
01:27:09,364 --> 01:27:11,193
Wait.

1738
01:27:11,328 --> 01:27:12,796
What?

1739
01:27:14,537 --> 01:27:16,331
I'm just kidding. Go for it.

1740
01:27:19,339 --> 01:27:21,475
That's my daughter.

1741
01:27:44,064 --> 01:27:46,930
Do you think if we'd kicked
a coconut around a few times,

1742
01:27:47,065 --> 01:27:49,371
things would have worked out
differently for us?

1743
01:27:50,972 --> 01:27:53,666
I'm sure some red and white
string couldn't have hurt.

1744
01:27:58,740 --> 01:28:00,406
Paul proposed.

1745
01:28:00,542 --> 01:28:02,743
I know.

1746
01:28:02,878 --> 01:28:05,354
This morning, he-he re-proposed.

1747
01:28:06,913 --> 01:28:09,051
What did you say?

1748
01:28:09,187 --> 01:28:12,223
I asked him for some ice
because he headbutted me.

1749
01:28:12,358 --> 01:28:13,826
Hmm.

1750
01:28:14,996 --> 01:28:17,524
A lot of guys would've gone in
for a kiss at that point.

1751
01:28:19,333 --> 01:28:21,530
Let me see your nose.

1752
01:28:21,666 --> 01:28:23,735
- Let's see.
- Mm.

1753
01:28:27,210 --> 01:28:29,004
I think you should say yes.

1754
01:28:35,110 --> 01:28:37,177
- Paul's a good guy.
- Mm-hmm.

1755
01:28:38,521 --> 01:28:42,222
And if he makes you
half as happy

1756
01:28:42,357 --> 01:28:44,954
as we were when we were happy...

1757
01:28:48,561 --> 01:28:50,630
then you should say yes.

1758
01:28:52,970 --> 01:28:54,700
I don't know.

1759
01:28:56,639 --> 01:28:59,135
Maybe I'm too old
to feel young anymore.

1760
01:28:59,271 --> 01:29:01,067
I...

1761
01:29:01,202 --> 01:29:02,901
think I missed
something critical,

1762
01:29:03,036 --> 01:29:04,941
and now it's too late.

1763
01:29:07,081 --> 01:29:09,418
Well...

1764
01:29:09,553 --> 01:29:11,717
you look like
you're in your prime to me.

1765
01:29:16,820 --> 01:29:18,658
Even with that crooked nose.

1766
01:29:36,673 --> 01:29:38,744
- Hi.
- Hi.

1767
01:29:57,927 --> 01:30:00,366
What are you doing out here?

1768
01:30:00,502 --> 01:30:03,202
Just looking at this garbage.

1769
01:30:03,338 --> 01:30:05,199
You call that a sunset?

1770
01:30:20,882 --> 01:30:23,019
I belong here.

1771
01:30:25,555 --> 01:30:27,287
I know.

1772
01:30:37,802 --> 01:30:40,003
Will you come and dance with me?

1773
01:30:46,216 --> 01:30:48,077
Let's go dance.

1774
01:31:01,730 --> 01:31:04,698
Wow. It's so quiet.

1775
01:31:07,535 --> 01:31:09,364
Hi.

1776
01:31:09,500 --> 01:31:11,230
Hi.

1777
01:31:11,365 --> 01:31:13,968
- Did I wake you?
- No.

1778
01:31:14,103 --> 01:31:15,468
- Was I kicking?
- No, no, no.

1779
01:31:15,603 --> 01:31:17,150
- Oh, my God, I was kicking.
- No, you weren't.

1780
01:31:17,174 --> 01:31:19,410
- You weren't. I was up.
- Oh. All right.

1781
01:31:22,414 --> 01:31:24,113
Um...

1782
01:31:24,248 --> 01:31:26,388
Well, the ferry is only leaving
this afternoon.

1783
01:31:26,524 --> 01:31:28,447
I guess we could go
paddleboarding.

1784
01:31:30,953 --> 01:31:32,924
I can't marry you, Paul.

1785
01:31:35,522 --> 01:31:37,698
It doesn't have to be
paddleboarding.

1786
01:31:38,760 --> 01:31:40,402
Oh.

1787
01:31:40,537 --> 01:31:42,168
- Did I do something wrong?
- No.

1788
01:31:42,303 --> 01:31:43,731
No, it's just...

1789
01:31:43,866 --> 01:31:46,241
It's the wrong...

1790
01:31:46,377 --> 01:31:50,271
time, wrong place, wrong girl.

1791
01:31:52,644 --> 01:31:54,440
I'm so sorry.

1792
01:31:59,916 --> 01:32:01,955
- Me, too.
- Mm.

1793
01:32:02,958 --> 01:32:05,055
And I'm not just agreeing
to agree with you.

1794
01:32:11,964 --> 01:32:13,998
I'm still gonna go
paddleboarding.

1795
01:32:26,112 --> 01:32:28,144
Get it!

1796
01:32:29,646 --> 01:32:31,345
Kick it!

1797
01:32:41,757 --> 01:32:43,027
Whoa!

1798
01:32:48,436 --> 01:32:50,003
Kick it!

1799
01:32:50,139 --> 01:32:51,431
Kick it.

1800
01:33:00,214 --> 01:33:02,413
Hold it up! Hold it up!
Hold it up! Hold it up!

1801
01:33:02,548 --> 01:33:03,877
No!

1802
01:33:04,013 --> 01:33:06,913
Come on, more. More.

1803
01:33:08,722 --> 01:33:10,316
Oh, fudge!

1804
01:33:10,451 --> 01:33:12,358
Now it's going.
Now it's go... Oh!

1805
01:33:12,494 --> 01:33:15,389
It's going! It's going!

1806
01:33:16,495 --> 01:33:18,161
Whoa!

1807
01:33:25,200 --> 01:33:26,675
Where's Paul?

1808
01:33:27,710 --> 01:33:29,672
He had a last-minute hop
to Hanoi.

1809
01:33:29,808 --> 01:33:31,537
Uh, he said to say bye.

1810
01:33:32,574 --> 01:33:35,041
I told him it wasn't gonna
work out for me.

1811
01:33:35,177 --> 01:33:38,386
For him. For m-me and him.

1812
01:33:38,521 --> 01:33:40,084
I said it better than that.

1813
01:33:41,850 --> 01:33:43,388
Oh, Mom.

1814
01:33:43,523 --> 01:33:45,253
I'm sorry.

1815
01:33:45,388 --> 01:33:47,425
Can we make this
a little more about me?

1816
01:33:48,858 --> 01:33:50,054
Of course.

1817
01:33:51,997 --> 01:33:54,593
What am I gonna do without you?

1818
01:33:58,772 --> 01:34:01,071
I want you to have these.

1819
01:34:01,206 --> 01:34:02,800
I was fine with you
getting married,

1820
01:34:02,936 --> 01:34:05,111
but I'm way too young
and gorgeous to be an aunt.

1821
01:34:12,851 --> 01:34:14,419
- Hey.
- Hey.

1822
01:34:16,251 --> 01:34:17,693
All right. All right, kiddo.

1823
01:34:18,755 --> 01:34:20,025
Okay.

1824
01:34:21,023 --> 01:34:22,890
Dad.

1825
01:34:23,025 --> 01:34:25,360
Oh, no. No crying.

1826
01:34:28,228 --> 01:34:30,365
Okay. I love you.

1827
01:34:35,542 --> 01:34:37,372
And I love you.

1828
01:34:39,216 --> 01:34:40,881
All right.

1829
01:34:44,752 --> 01:34:46,116
- All right.
- Bye.

1830
01:34:46,252 --> 01:34:48,482
- You take care of yourself.
- You, too.

1831
01:34:52,387 --> 01:34:55,225
Mm. I love you.

1832
01:35:02,099 --> 01:35:04,663
I super love you.

1833
01:35:38,804 --> 01:35:41,202
Sorry about Paul.

1834
01:35:41,337 --> 01:35:43,167
- No, you're not.
- Not really.

1835
01:35:47,608 --> 01:35:49,084
I'm gonna miss her.

1836
01:35:49,219 --> 01:35:51,182
Yeah.

1837
01:35:53,216 --> 01:35:55,850
I see why she likes it here.

1838
01:35:55,985 --> 01:35:58,024
Yeah, it's good.

1839
01:35:59,324 --> 01:36:02,327
I could see spending
some time here.

1840
01:36:02,463 --> 01:36:04,228
Someday.

1841
01:36:14,338 --> 01:36:17,069
Why save the good stuff
for later?

1842
01:36:17,204 --> 01:36:19,309
Yeah.

1843
01:36:32,856 --> 01:36:34,324
What?

1844
01:36:48,512 --> 01:36:50,377
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1845
01:37:24,475 --> 01:37:26,311
I won't let her
throw her life away

1846
01:37:26,447 --> 01:37:28,509

who happens to live
