1
00:00:35,953 --> 00:00:39,122
[siren wailing]

2
00:00:39,206 --> 00:00:40,624
[architect] So you're asking her tonight?

3
00:00:40,707 --> 00:00:42,709
[sighs] Yeah. Any advice?

4
00:00:42,793 --> 00:00:46,004
Go for the grand gesture.
I used to do stuff like that all the time.

5
00:00:46,088 --> 00:00:49,049
He never did anything like that.
It was totally out of character.

6
00:00:49,132 --> 00:00:51,260
[auctioneer] 40,000. Do I have 45?

7
00:00:51,343 --> 00:00:52,636
-Actually…
-[auctioneer] 45,000.

8
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:56,181
…David's proposal was probably
the only time he ever surprised me.

9
00:00:56,265 --> 00:00:58,308
[David] We dated all four years
she was in college.

10
00:00:58,392 --> 00:01:00,894
I had a spot in the master's program
for architecture,

11
00:01:00,978 --> 00:01:02,980
so I was definitely staying in Chicago.

12
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:05,816
Then out of nowhere,
I get an offer from a great gallery in LA.

13
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:06,900
[auctioneer] 70,000?

14
00:01:06,984 --> 00:01:07,985
[art collector] Seventy.

15
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:09,236
70,000.

16
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:10,821
So the night before graduation…

17
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:12,906
…and she springs it on me
she's leaving.

18
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:15,075
And I'm calm.
You know, happy for her.

19
00:01:15,158 --> 00:01:17,202
[art collector] He freaks out completely.

20
00:01:18,245 --> 00:01:21,373
So, the next morning, the ceremony,

21
00:01:21,456 --> 00:01:24,501
I'm up there walking towards
the dean and my diploma,

22
00:01:24,585 --> 00:01:30,382
and suddenly, there's David,
right next to me, down on one knee.

23
00:01:31,008 --> 00:01:32,593
And she starts crying.

24
00:01:32,676 --> 00:01:34,428
I'm so embarrassed.

25
00:01:35,053 --> 00:01:37,848
The whole place erupts.
Everybody's clapping and shouting.

26
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:40,100
Except her parents.
They thought she was too young.

27
00:01:40,184 --> 00:01:42,144
-They thought I could do better.
-[auctioneer] Going once.

28
00:01:42,227 --> 00:01:43,812
But who ever listens
to their parents?

29
00:01:43,896 --> 00:01:45,397
Sold to Georgia Cotton.

30
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:51,612
Long story short,
she didn't move to California,

31
00:01:51,695 --> 00:01:53,906
and a month later,
we were pregnant with Lily.

32
00:01:53,989 --> 00:01:56,575
[breathes heavily] That's amazing!
Wait, how long ago?

33
00:01:57,409 --> 00:01:59,536
Let me do the math.

34
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:02,581
March 7th, it'll be 25 years.

35
00:02:02,664 --> 00:02:04,708
Incredible. Twenty-five years of marriage.

36
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:07,002
Oh, God. We're not married.

37
00:02:07,085 --> 00:02:08,920
God, no. [grunts]

38
00:02:09,003 --> 00:02:11,548
[chuckles] We divorced five years later.

39
00:02:11,632 --> 00:02:15,219
And it's not one of those
amicable divorces you see on TV.

40
00:02:15,302 --> 00:02:17,846
I try not to be in the same time zone
if I can help it.

41
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:20,057
But Lily's graduating tomorrow,
so here I am.

42
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,642
Wow, that's gotta be awkward.

43
00:02:21,725 --> 00:02:24,186
What? No. Ancient history.

44
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:26,438
Oh, yeah. Nightmare. [chuckles]

45
00:02:27,314 --> 00:02:28,482
Check, please.

46
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:30,984
[students chattering]

47
00:02:32,945 --> 00:02:34,154
What are you doing?

48
00:02:35,239 --> 00:02:37,241
-I'm packing.
-You're packing work.

49
00:02:37,324 --> 00:02:40,077
Don't pack work.
Why would you pack work?

50
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,621
Because it's a short vacation
and a very long life afterwards.

51
00:02:42,704 --> 00:02:44,122
Yeah, I've been thinking about that,

52
00:02:44,206 --> 00:02:46,291
and I really don't think
this whole "being an adult" thing

53
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:48,836
-is gonna work out for me.
-[cell phone vibrating]

54
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:51,463
[sighs] Yeah, well,
I don't really have a choice.

55
00:02:52,381 --> 00:02:53,382
Hey, Mom.

56
00:02:53,465 --> 00:02:57,511
So I'm just steaming my outfit,
and I am wondering where I'm sitting.

57
00:02:58,095 --> 00:03:02,558
Not that it matters. To me, I mean. Just--
I mean, it doesn't matter to me at all.

58
00:03:02,641 --> 00:03:04,142
-Then why did you--
-[cell phone beeps]

Oh, hang on. It's Dad.

Hey, Dad. Mom's on the other line.

62

-[David] Don't say hi from me.
-[Lily sighs]

63
00:03:10,941 --> 00:03:12,484
You're not sitting together,
okay?

64
00:03:12,568 --> 00:03:14,111
You're on opposite sides
of the auditorium,

65
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:15,612
which is the size of Rhode Island.

66
00:03:15,696 --> 00:03:17,239
That's the smallest state.

no arguing, no passive aggression?

What about aggressive
aggression? Is that okay?

[Georgia] I love you.

Come on. We shake an old guy's hand
and wear a dumb hat.

Good afternoon.

79

Excuse me. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

80
00:03:49,313 --> 00:03:52,900
On behalf of the faculty
and staff of Pullman University…

81
00:03:52,983 --> 00:03:53,984
Big day.

82
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:58,488
…it is my privilege to welcome
the parents, family and friends

83
00:03:58,572 --> 00:04:00,157
of our graduating seniors.

84
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,950
You gotta be kidding me.

85
00:04:02,034 --> 00:04:05,871
Guess this is my seat, as you haven't
had a date since Lily was in braces.

86
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:08,081
At least when I do date,
it's age appropriate.

87
00:04:08,165 --> 00:04:09,166
[Georgia scoffs]

88
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:11,376
You just don't like him
because he's French.

89
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:14,755
I like the French. I like their fries.
Their toast. Their mustard.

90
00:04:14,838 --> 00:04:17,089
I specifically asked Lily
not to seat us together.

91
00:04:17,173 --> 00:04:18,466
You called her? That's so pathetic.

92

-Shh. It's starting.
-Don't shush me.

Excuse me.
That's my armrest.

No, it's in the middle.

-This is so like you. Take, take, take.
-It is not a metaphor. It is an armrest.

-Give me half, please. I would like half.
-Just stop. Just stop.

102
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:51,708
Just give me half!
What is wrong with you?

-I just want half!

-You take a picture.

-I'm in the moment.
-Why do you need a picture?

106
00:05:01,093 --> 00:05:02,886
-So I don't forget the moment.
-Ah…

-Love you more.

-Proudest!

seven too many Jägerbombs last night.

The other six were perfection.

of exams in the last week.

123

[David] Well, in the next three months,
she starts at the top law firm in Chicago.

and you need to calm down.

00:16:08,343 --> 00:16:10,679
-Oh, did she respond to your email?
-Yes.

316
00:16:10,762 --> 00:16:12,222
And there she is!

317
00:16:14,349 --> 00:16:15,893
-Oh, my God. Paul!
-[Paul chuckles]

318
00:16:15,976 --> 00:16:17,102
Paul?

319
00:16:17,186 --> 00:16:19,730
I know you love a surprise. I know you do.

320
00:16:19,813 --> 00:16:21,648
-Mmm.
-You!

321
00:16:22,316 --> 00:16:23,942
Looks like someone upgraded.

322
00:16:24,026 --> 00:16:25,152
She hates a surprise.

323
00:16:26,445 --> 00:16:28,071
David?
What are you doing here?

324
00:16:28,155 --> 00:16:30,199
I'm flying to Bali.
What are you doing here?

325
00:16:30,282 --> 00:16:31,658
I'm flying you to Bali.

326
00:16:32,326 --> 00:16:34,077
-I couldn't let her go alone…
-Ah.

327
00:16:34,161 --> 00:16:36,121
…so I traded flights with a friend.

328
00:16:36,205 --> 00:16:39,082
Gotta captain three long hauls
to Uruguay next month, but…

329
00:16:39,791 --> 00:16:41,418
The things you do for love, right?

330
00:16:41,502 --> 00:16:43,670
-[whispers] It's so sweet.
-[whispers] I know.

331
00:16:46,006 --> 00:16:47,841
-[Paul] Mmm.
-So sweet.

332
00:16:48,342 --> 00:16:50,093
-[speaking French]
-[Georgia] Mmm.

333
00:16:51,094 --> 00:16:53,388
-[Georgia] Ah, oui. Me too.
-[kissing]

334

-[chuckles]
-[speaking French]

336
00:17:02,022 --> 00:17:04,441
[chuckles, in English] Oh, my. Those eyes.

337
00:17:04,525 --> 00:17:05,858
Couldn't you just
swim in them?

338
00:17:05,943 --> 00:17:08,319
They're blue. Big deal.
So are my socks.

339
00:17:08,403 --> 00:17:10,821
And Frenchmen make such great lovers.

340
00:17:10,906 --> 00:17:12,950
That's a rumor
they started about themselves.

341
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:14,367
Oh, keep telling yourself that.

342
00:17:14,451 --> 00:17:16,244
-[chuckles]
-Oh!

343
00:17:16,328 --> 00:17:17,329
Champagne!

344
00:17:17,412 --> 00:17:18,664
Oh, two, please.

345
00:17:18,747 --> 00:17:21,375
Just leave the bottle. Thank you.

346
00:17:24,169 --> 00:17:27,089
Baby, I don't think that him tagging along
on your trip is going to help.

347
00:17:27,172 --> 00:17:28,674
Well, that's a hot take.

348
00:17:28,757 --> 00:17:31,885
The last time David was actually helpful
was the night we made Lily.

349
00:17:31,969 --> 00:17:34,721
[chuckles] There's an image
I'm not crazy about.

350
00:17:34,805 --> 00:17:37,891
Mmm. You live. You learn.
You upgrade.

351
00:17:37,975 --> 00:17:38,976
[curtain opens]

352
00:17:40,269 --> 00:17:42,813
Aren't you supposed to be
flying the plane, Paul?

353
00:17:42,896 --> 00:17:44,857
Or at least not making out
with the passengers?

354
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:47,651
Just this passenger.
The only one that counts.

355
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:51,738
It's a totally foreign concept to you,
but Paul puts me first.

356
00:17:51,822 --> 00:17:53,240
He supports everything I do.

357
00:17:53,323 --> 00:17:55,409
That's because
everything she does is perfect.

358
00:17:55,492 --> 00:17:56,660
He's exaggerating.

359
00:17:56,743 --> 00:17:57,744
Is he?

360
00:17:57,828 --> 00:17:59,204
-Are you?
-I'm really not.

361
00:17:59,288 --> 00:18:01,164
-Sure you are.
-If you say so.

362
00:18:01,248 --> 00:18:03,083
-[plane rumbling]
-[passengers clamoring]

363
00:18:03,667 --> 00:18:05,878
Okay, it's just a little turbulence.

364
00:18:05,961 --> 00:18:08,672
The plane is actually designed
to right itself in--

365
00:18:09,381 --> 00:18:10,591
Please go back to your seats.

366
00:18:11,466 --> 00:18:15,137
-[fasten seat belt sign chimes]
-[passengers gasp]

367
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:19,099
That was my house. My garden. My house.

368
00:18:19,183 --> 00:18:21,351
Why do I have so many
pictures of my house?

369
00:18:21,435 --> 00:18:23,478
Oh! There's Charlie. He's my dog.

370
00:18:23,562 --> 00:18:26,190
-Did I mention he's very old and unwell?
-[thunder rumbles]

371
00:18:26,273 --> 00:18:28,901
-It's gonna be all right. Really.
-You're right. It's gonna be fine.

[passengers gasp]

374
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:38,994
[Paul] These things happen, of course,
you know.

375
00:18:39,077 --> 00:18:41,663
Pilots aren't magicians.
We only have so much control up there.

376
00:18:41,747 --> 00:18:43,498
Of course. People understand that.

377
00:18:43,582 --> 00:18:45,000
You're the fucking worst.

378
00:18:45,083 --> 00:18:47,503
Nice try killing us, asshole!

379
00:18:49,254 --> 00:18:51,423
Maybe you should go,
before they get out the pitchforks.

380
00:18:51,507 --> 00:18:53,759
-I'll see you when you get back here.
-Yeah.

381
00:18:54,259 --> 00:18:56,136
-Okay. I'll see you in four days.
-Yes.

382
00:19:02,267 --> 00:19:03,310
Don't blame yourself, Paul.

383
00:19:03,393 --> 00:19:06,146
It could happen to anybody
who doesn't know what they're doing.

384
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:07,523
Where's Lily?

385
00:19:07,606 --> 00:19:10,400
I thought you got her email.
She's meeting us off the boat.

386
00:19:11,818 --> 00:19:13,111
What?

387
00:19:29,044 --> 00:19:31,672
This is the most incredible place
I've ever seen.

388
00:19:31,755 --> 00:19:33,006
[David] You know what's incredible?

389
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:36,343
-Hawaii. And it's in America.
-You've never been to Hawaii.

390
00:19:36,426 --> 00:19:38,679
-You don't know where I've been.
-You've never been to Hawaii.

391
00:19:38,762 --> 00:19:41,181
-Ah…
-Okay. Let's talk game plan.

392
00:19:41,849 --> 00:19:45,018
As much as this will pain us both,
we have to call a truce to make this work.

393
00:19:45,102 --> 00:19:46,436
Yes, we need to be in lockstep.

394
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:47,896
-No meanness.
-No arguing.

395
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:49,731
-We speak as one.
-Exactly right.

396
00:19:49,815 --> 00:19:51,942
-When do we start?
-Right after we see Lily.

397
00:19:54,069 --> 00:19:57,698
We tell her the wedding is off,
and we'll bring her home.

398
00:19:57,781 --> 00:20:00,868
[Georgia] Well, you know whenever we say
"don't" to Lily, she just hears "do."

399
00:20:00,951 --> 00:20:05,247
I say we go in
100% there for her in all ways.

400
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:07,958
Just supportive and loving.

401
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:10,669
And that's how we trick her into
dumping Mr. Seaweed.

402
00:20:10,752 --> 00:20:13,589
That's interesting. Now, I'm thinking
about a Trojan horse sort of thing.

403
00:20:13,672 --> 00:20:15,257
We make her think
we're okay with the wedding,

404
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:17,259
and then once we're in,
we get her to end it herself.

405
00:20:18,427 --> 00:20:19,928
That's literally what I just said.

406
00:20:21,221 --> 00:20:23,056
I don't remember
anything about a Trojan horse.

407
00:20:25,392 --> 00:20:27,853
[locals chattering in Balinese]

408
00:20:31,899 --> 00:20:33,066
[Georgia] Okay, so you got the plan?

409
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:34,818
[David] Of course I got the plan.
It's my plan.

410
00:20:34,902 --> 00:20:35,986
Thanks, fellas.

411

-[Georgia] Hey.

412

-Hey, guys! Hey, Dad.
-Hey. Hi.

413
00:20:43,744 --> 00:20:45,621
-Hi.
-Hi. Hey and hi. [chuckles]

414
00:20:46,496 --> 00:20:49,166
So, did you make a pact
to not murder each other

415
00:20:49,249 --> 00:20:50,334
until you murder me first?

416
00:20:50,417 --> 00:20:53,086
-Come on. Nobody is murdering anybody.
-[chuckles] No, no.

417
00:20:53,170 --> 00:20:55,130
I mean, of course,
we have some questions.

418
00:20:55,214 --> 00:20:57,883
We are your parents.
We are here for you, my love.

419
00:20:57,966 --> 00:20:59,510
-Yes, we're in lockstep.
-Yes. Right.

420
00:20:59,593 --> 00:21:01,929
I've been really freaked out
about what you guys were gonna say.

421
00:21:02,012 --> 00:21:04,932
Especially you, Dad. I mean, you had
a panic attack when I pierced my ears.

422
00:21:05,015 --> 00:21:06,725
-Yes.
-Well, it's just about hygiene.

423
00:21:06,808 --> 00:21:08,810
And I know how much
you wanted the lawyer thing. It just--

424
00:21:08,894 --> 00:21:11,396
-Well--
-We just-- We want you to be happy, honey.

425
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:12,606
Yeah.

00:21:14,107 --> 00:21:17,736
-Wow. Okay. That is such a relief.
-[chuckles]

428
00:21:17,819 --> 00:21:18,946
All right.

429
00:21:19,029 --> 00:21:20,113
Wow.

-Hey, Wren.

-Don't mind me. Just here for backup.
-We're all good now.

and you'll love Gede.

-Love him!
-[Georgia] Gede? That's a nice name.

-Really nice.
-Okay, please stop.

435
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:33,544
Can't wait to hear
all about seaweed farming.

436
00:21:35,337 --> 00:21:37,673
Are you guys sure you're good with this?

437
00:21:38,966 --> 00:21:40,759
'Cause you know you could just tell me.

438
00:21:41,593 --> 00:21:44,012
You don't have to do
a whole Trojan horse thing.

439
00:21:44,847 --> 00:21:48,100
-What-- What are you-- What are you--
-What? What's it-- What's that?

440
00:21:48,183 --> 00:21:50,227
Didn't you tell me that story, Mom?

441
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:51,520
No, I told you. Trojan horse?

442
00:21:51,603 --> 00:21:53,647
-I told you that story. That was me.
-Fine.

443
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:56,900
It doesn't matter.
We just are both here for you.

Yeah. Lockstep.

straight to the hotel.

Yeah, well, you were supposed to be here
hours ago. [chuckles]

-It wasn't his fault.
-Pilot error.

448
00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:31,894
The engagement party kinda starts now, so…

449
00:22:31,977 --> 00:22:33,270
Who's gonna be there?

450
00:22:34,021 --> 00:22:35,230
Just close family.

451
00:22:38,609 --> 00:22:41,612
Okay. Time for a walk.

452
00:22:42,529 --> 00:22:43,822
Wait, what?

453
00:22:43,906 --> 00:22:45,073
We get back on at the top.

454
00:22:45,157 --> 00:22:46,742
It just can't make it
with all these people.

455
00:22:46,825 --> 00:22:49,620
Unbelievable.
I want my 4,000 whatevers back.

456
00:22:49,703 --> 00:22:51,622
You know that's like a quarter, right?

[in English] Hey.

You learned that
to make me look bad.

00:23:07,554 --> 00:23:09,014
You don't need my help there.

Uh, Mr. and Mrs. Cotton,
I welcome you to my country

and soon to my home.

You can just call me Georgia.

Yeah,
I'm good with Mr. Cotton.

468
00:23:23,237 --> 00:23:24,488
[motorcycle approaching]

469
00:23:24,571 --> 00:23:25,906
-[Wren] Hi, guys!
-There goes Wren.

470
00:23:25,989 --> 00:23:27,199
[Wren] Bye, guys!

471
00:23:28,075 --> 00:23:30,202
Uh, Georgia,
perhaps I can give you a lift?

472
00:23:30,285 --> 00:23:31,870
-Oh, let's do it.
-Yeah.

473
00:23:33,205 --> 00:23:34,998
-[chuckles]
-[engine starts]

474
00:23:35,082 --> 00:23:36,792
-Bye.
-[Gede] See you there!

475
00:23:38,085 --> 00:23:39,086
[Lily sighs]

476
00:23:39,169 --> 00:23:40,337
Isn't he amazing?

477
00:23:41,171 --> 00:23:42,422
Only if he drops her.

478
00:23:43,215 --> 00:23:44,508
-Dad--
-Come on. Let's go.

479
00:23:44,842 --> 00:23:46,218
[people chattering]

480
00:23:50,848 --> 00:23:52,307
This is just close family?

481
00:23:53,141 --> 00:23:56,603
[Lily] And the incredible thing is,
is that they're all actually close.

482
00:23:56,687 --> 00:24:00,315
Okay. Remember, shoes off inside,
eat with your right hand,

483
00:24:00,399 --> 00:24:02,901
and never,
ever touch anyone's head.

484
00:24:04,069 --> 00:24:05,821
Why would I wanna touch
anyone's head?

485
00:24:06,697 --> 00:24:07,698
Hey, guys.

486
00:24:07,781 --> 00:24:09,116
[Wren whispers] Mr. C?

487
00:24:09,199 --> 00:24:13,620
This is Komang,
and these are his tattoos.

488
00:24:13,704 --> 00:24:14,913
Nice to meet you.

489
00:24:14,997 --> 00:24:15,998
He doesn't know it,

490
00:24:16,081 --> 00:24:18,250
but we're gonna be
having breakfast tomorrow.

491
00:24:18,333 --> 00:24:19,334
Hey.

492
00:24:20,794 --> 00:24:22,337
Is she coming to breakfast too?

493
00:24:23,672 --> 00:24:25,215
-[Wren sighs]
-[Komang chattering]

494
00:24:25,299 --> 00:24:26,925
I need to get one of those.

495
00:24:29,845 --> 00:24:30,929
[in Balinese] Putri!

496
00:24:31,013 --> 00:24:32,014
[in English] Hey.

497
00:24:32,097 --> 00:24:34,266
-What did he call you?
-It means "daughter."

498
00:24:34,349 --> 00:24:35,851
Oh. Oh.

499
00:24:35,934 --> 00:24:37,769
You're my daughter.

500
00:24:37,853 --> 00:24:38,896
My daughter.

501
00:24:40,355 --> 00:24:42,900
-[chuckles]
-From here on, we will share her.

502
00:24:42,983 --> 00:24:47,779
We'll be united for all of time
in the unbreakable bond of family.

503
00:24:47,863 --> 00:24:50,282
-It's us.
-Okay, yeah. You can let go anytime.

504
00:24:50,949 --> 00:24:52,576
-Good.
-Yeah. [chuckles]

505
00:24:52,659 --> 00:24:53,911
Now give me your knife.

506
00:24:54,703 --> 00:24:55,829
My-- My knife?

507
00:24:56,413 --> 00:24:57,414
Give me your knife.

508
00:24:58,248 --> 00:24:59,374
I didn't bring a knife.

509
00:24:59,458 --> 00:25:01,835
-No knife?
-I didn't bring a knife. [chuckles]

510
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:03,170
-No knife?
-No, no--

511
00:25:03,253 --> 00:25:05,839
-[laughs] Okay.
-No problem.

512
00:25:05,923 --> 00:25:08,217
Wow. [laughs]

513
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:10,969
It is a Balinese custom
that upon meeting,

514
00:25:11,512 --> 00:25:14,139
the two fathers must cut deeply
into their forearms,

515
00:25:15,349 --> 00:25:18,810
and each smear
the other blood.

516
00:25:19,686 --> 00:25:22,272
[laughing]
You should really see your face.

517
00:25:22,356 --> 00:25:23,857
[laughing]

518
00:25:26,276 --> 00:25:28,445
[both laughing]

519
00:25:29,112 --> 00:25:31,406
-[Lily] Hey, guys! Gimme some.
-Hi.

520
00:25:31,490 --> 00:25:33,367
Yeah. Ow, ow, ow!

521
00:25:35,827 --> 00:25:36,912
[sighs]

522
00:25:36,995 --> 00:25:40,165
What's amazing is with such a big family,
there's always something to celebrate.

523
00:25:40,249 --> 00:25:42,751
But if not, they just celebrate
that it's a big family.

524
00:25:42,835 --> 00:25:44,586
Well, I need to celebrate
learning some names

525
00:25:44,670 --> 00:25:46,588
because there's just
too many people to remember.

526
00:25:46,672 --> 00:25:48,841
I did make a spreadsheet.
I haven't gotten most of them.

527
00:25:48,924 --> 00:25:52,803
-I usually just smile a lot. [chuckles]
-Ah, you're in the kitchen. That's new.

528
00:25:52,886 --> 00:25:54,054
Lily!

529
00:25:54,137 --> 00:25:55,138
[in Balinese] Meme!

530
00:25:55,222 --> 00:25:59,226
[in English] Oh, Mom, Dad, this is
Gede's mother, Suli, and his sister, Losi.

531
00:25:59,309 --> 00:26:01,270
-Losi's training to be a doctor.
-[David] Mmm.

532
00:26:01,353 --> 00:26:03,605
Fantastic. Hi, nice to meet you.

533
00:26:03,689 --> 00:26:06,108
[speaking Balinese]

534
00:26:26,044 --> 00:26:27,588
[in English]
She says, "Welcome."

535
00:26:28,755 --> 00:26:29,756
Oh.

536
00:26:31,842 --> 00:26:34,011
[Gede] The kids play football out here
in the morning before school.

537
00:26:34,094 --> 00:26:35,971
-[David] Mmm.
-You'd be welcome to join in.

538
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:38,390
Not my game.
I wouldn't count on it.

539
00:26:39,057 --> 00:26:40,350
How do you farm the seaweed?

540
00:26:40,434 --> 00:26:42,186
Oh! Uh, we use nets.

541
00:26:42,269 --> 00:26:44,521
Uh, seedlings are tied
to monofilament lines,

542
00:26:44,605 --> 00:26:47,107
then five weeks later, we bring them in.

543
00:26:47,191 --> 00:26:49,902
A distributor flash freezes it
and ships it out.

544
00:26:49,985 --> 00:26:50,986
Ships it to where?

545
00:26:51,737 --> 00:26:55,073
It used to be mainly Japan.
Now, all over the world.

546
00:26:55,866 --> 00:26:59,369
We just signed a deal with Whole Foods.
So, we're right on your street corner.

547
00:27:01,538 --> 00:27:03,040
[chuckles] Mmm.

548
00:27:03,123 --> 00:27:05,042
[people chattering]

549
00:27:06,835 --> 00:27:09,046
[speaking Balinese]

550
00:27:10,130 --> 00:27:11,882
[in English]
He says you are very beautiful.

551
00:27:11,965 --> 00:27:15,093
Oh. Well, um,
tell him I said thank you.

552
00:27:15,177 --> 00:27:16,261
[speaking Balinese]

553
00:27:16,345 --> 00:27:18,138
[speaking Balinese]

554
00:27:19,139 --> 00:27:22,643
[in English] And now he is saying
you remind him of a very attractive horse.

555
00:27:23,185 --> 00:27:25,395
Oh. Really?

556
00:27:26,146 --> 00:27:27,356
That can't be right.

557
00:27:27,439 --> 00:27:30,067
[speaking Balinese]

558
00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:32,611
[speaking Balinese]

559
00:27:33,987 --> 00:27:36,990
-[in English] No, he-- He did mean horse.
-Oh. [clears throat]

560
00:27:37,074 --> 00:27:38,659
-[speaking Balinese]
-Mmm.

561
00:27:39,535 --> 00:27:40,536
Oh…

562
00:27:42,246 --> 00:27:43,664
-Mr. Cotton?
-Hmm?

563
00:27:43,747 --> 00:27:46,458
I must tell you,
I love your daughter very much.

564
00:27:46,542 --> 00:27:47,584
I don't blame you.

565
00:27:47,668 --> 00:27:50,128
And I appreciate that
it's happening really fast,

566
00:27:50,212 --> 00:27:52,089
and you and Georgia
must be alarmed by that.

567
00:27:53,131 --> 00:27:57,511
Well, you two seem good together.
Lily loves Bali.

568
00:27:58,262 --> 00:28:00,973
I can see her being happy here.
For a while.

569
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:03,433
For a while?

570
00:28:04,351 --> 00:28:05,978
Well, nothing lasts forever.

571
00:28:07,396 --> 00:28:08,647
Marriage is supposed to.

572
00:28:09,523 --> 00:28:11,859
That's what I thought
till I was sitting across from Georgia

573
00:28:11,942 --> 00:28:14,278
with a bunch of lawyers,
dividing up our stuff.

574
00:28:14,945 --> 00:28:17,823
So, enjoy this.

575
00:28:17,906 --> 00:28:20,868
Right up until the minute
that Lily ends it.

576
00:28:20,951 --> 00:28:25,455
Which she will because she's ambitious,
and she is endlessly curious.

577
00:28:25,539 --> 00:28:30,460
And as beautiful as this island is,
and as pleasant as you seem to be,

578
00:28:31,253 --> 00:28:33,338
ultimately,
it's just not gonna be enough.

579
00:28:35,507 --> 00:28:37,801
A bit of advice. Don't have kids.

580
00:28:37,885 --> 00:28:39,887
Makes it much more complicated
when she takes them

581
00:28:39,970 --> 00:28:41,555
and she goes back to the States.

582
00:28:45,142 --> 00:28:47,686
-I'm hungry. You hungry?
-[pats side]

583
00:28:47,769 --> 00:28:50,230
Yeah, let's get something to eat.
Let's get some food.

584
00:28:54,318 --> 00:28:56,445
[chattering]

585
00:28:58,864 --> 00:29:00,282
[Gede's father claps]

586
00:29:00,365 --> 00:29:01,992
-[speaking Balinese]
-[chattering stops]

587
00:29:04,912 --> 00:29:08,540
[in English] Today, in honor of
our guests of distinction,

588
00:29:08,624 --> 00:29:10,083
I speak to you English.

589
00:29:11,001 --> 00:29:13,795
I'm pretty sure you don't win anything
for finishing the whole pig.

590
00:29:14,713 --> 00:29:18,342
Paul's such a lucky guy.
All that judgment all to himself.

591
00:29:18,425 --> 00:29:24,014
Suli and I welcome with love and peace,
all friends and family, into our home.

592
00:29:24,765 --> 00:29:28,435
Soon also to be the home of Gede and Lily.

593
00:29:29,019 --> 00:29:30,979
-Or not.
-[Gede's father] And how proud we are…

594
00:29:31,063 --> 00:29:32,606
Gede is having second thoughts.

595
00:29:32,689 --> 00:29:34,191
I saw the two of you.
What happened?

596
00:29:34,274 --> 00:29:36,818
[David] I initiated phase two.

597
00:29:36,902 --> 00:29:39,321
We get out of the Trojan horse.
We start killing people.

598
00:29:40,030 --> 00:29:41,782
We are nowhere near phase two.

599
00:29:41,865 --> 00:29:43,659
Maybe you're at a different party,

600
00:29:43,742 --> 00:29:47,120
but from where I'm sitting,
we're about to inherit 150 new in-laws.

601
00:29:47,204 --> 00:29:49,289
Oh, God. You only ever
see things your own way.

602
00:29:49,373 --> 00:29:51,083
Everybody only ever
sees anything their own way.

603
00:29:51,166 --> 00:29:52,793
Explains why you walked out
on me and Lily.

604
00:29:52,876 --> 00:29:54,461
I didn't walk out on Lily.

605
00:29:54,545 --> 00:29:57,005
[speaking Balinese]

606
00:29:58,549 --> 00:30:01,552
[in English] For marriage,
it must to be the right place.

607
00:30:02,302 --> 00:30:04,513
It must to be the right time.

608
00:30:05,222 --> 00:30:07,432
It must to be the right circumstance.

609
00:30:07,516 --> 00:30:10,561
I wish someone had explained that to us.
We were 0 for 3.

610
00:30:11,436 --> 00:30:12,855
-1 for 3.
-Hmm?

611
00:30:12,938 --> 00:30:13,939
1 for 3.

612
00:30:14,731 --> 00:30:16,358
Wrong circumstance,
wrong time.

613
00:30:16,441 --> 00:30:19,820
Right place. By the lake.

614
00:30:20,612 --> 00:30:26,493
So, I announce that Gede will marry Lily
in four days' time,

615
00:30:26,577 --> 00:30:29,788
as suggested by
Ida Anak Lingsir.

616
00:30:32,833 --> 00:30:35,210
Mother of my children, do you agree?

617
00:30:35,294 --> 00:30:37,588
[speaking Balinese]

618
00:30:42,259 --> 00:30:45,262
[in English] She gives her blessing.
For now and for always.

619
00:30:46,096 --> 00:30:49,474
And David? Georgia? Do you agree?

620
00:30:50,851 --> 00:30:53,604
Um, yes,
we give our blessing.

621
00:30:54,396 --> 00:30:56,148
-Yep.
-Yes. For now--

622
00:30:56,231 --> 00:30:57,649
-And always.

623
00:30:57,733 --> 00:30:58,734
-[Gede's father] Great.
-Right.

624
00:30:58,817 --> 00:30:59,818
That's good.

625
00:31:05,282 --> 00:31:09,828
[Lily sighs] That went great.
Just great.

626
00:31:09,912 --> 00:31:12,915
[Gede] Absolutely it did.
Could not have gone any better.

627
00:31:16,835 --> 00:31:18,754
What were you and my dad
talking about by the beach?

628
00:31:18,837 --> 00:31:21,381
Seaweed, mostly.
He had a lot of questions.

629
00:31:23,842 --> 00:31:26,011
-He loves you.
-[chuckles]

630
00:31:26,094 --> 00:31:29,139
He loves you. They both do.

631
00:31:30,599 --> 00:31:34,311
Well, I'm the only thing
they can ever agree on. [chuckles]

632
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:36,021
Really?

633
00:31:36,813 --> 00:31:37,814
Good to know.

634
00:31:40,901 --> 00:31:42,986
[hotel clerk] Welcome to the Hotel Waruna.

635
00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:47,324
It is a very great pleasure
to see your smiling faces.

636
00:31:48,909 --> 00:31:52,913
You, sir, are in 221. Really good room.

637
00:31:53,956 --> 00:31:55,249
Make sure I'm a long way
from her.

638
00:31:55,832 --> 00:31:56,834
And you, madam?

639
00:31:58,168 --> 00:31:59,962
A very long way, please.

640
00:32:00,045 --> 00:32:03,382
222. Almost just as really good.

641
00:32:05,634 --> 00:32:06,885
Do you still snore?

642
00:32:07,886 --> 00:32:10,848
Do you know anybody that snores less
when they get older?

643
00:32:11,348 --> 00:32:13,600
If I'm gonna be listening
to you all night,

644
00:32:13,684 --> 00:32:15,644
I'm gonna do it from the better room.

645
00:32:16,812 --> 00:32:18,981
You know, you used to do sleep karate.

646
00:32:19,064 --> 00:32:21,900
You'd fling yourself around the bed
like you were attacking it.

647
00:32:22,442 --> 00:32:25,279
I wasn't asleep.
I was attacking you.

648
00:32:25,362 --> 00:32:26,363
There you go.

649
00:32:28,323 --> 00:32:29,741
Try to keep the snoring down.

650
00:32:29,825 --> 00:32:33,203
-I have a nasal strip.
-It's a mystery you're still alone.

651
00:32:50,387 --> 00:32:51,930
[grunts]

652
00:32:54,349 --> 00:32:55,475
Ah!

653
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:04,276
Get another one of these?

654
00:33:05,569 --> 00:33:07,321
I'll have two of whatever he's having.

655
00:33:08,906 --> 00:33:10,949
Hello, Wren.
What are you doing here?

656
00:33:11,033 --> 00:33:12,492
Unlike your daughter,
I've never been

657
00:33:12,576 --> 00:33:15,204
a thatched-hut-with-a-dirt-floor
kind of gal.

658
00:33:15,287 --> 00:33:17,831
I've got a nicely appointed
broom closet here.

659
00:33:17,915 --> 00:33:18,916
Good for you.

660
00:33:20,792 --> 00:33:23,253
You know, I blame you
for this whole shit show.

661
00:33:23,337 --> 00:33:24,463
[Wren] That's what you think of it?

662
00:33:25,297 --> 00:33:26,298
You don't?

663
00:33:27,382 --> 00:33:28,967
Lily's happy.

664
00:33:29,051 --> 00:33:32,179
And after four years of watching her
beat herself up at college,

665
00:33:32,262 --> 00:33:33,889
I love to see that.

666
00:33:34,723 --> 00:33:36,058
I thought you might too.

667
00:33:36,141 --> 00:33:40,354
Hey, look, happy is great.
Lily happy is the greatest of all.

668
00:33:40,437 --> 00:33:45,609
It's just that a weird thing happens
when you become a parent.

669
00:33:45,692 --> 00:33:50,113
When your kid is down,
when they're in pain, it kills you.

670
00:33:50,781 --> 00:33:53,200
But when they're up,
when things are going great,

671
00:33:54,910 --> 00:33:56,870
that's when you get really scared.

672
00:33:56,954 --> 00:33:59,248
Because you don't want it to change,

673
00:33:59,331 --> 00:34:00,749
and you know it will.

674
00:34:01,708 --> 00:34:02,835
Does it always?

675
00:34:03,836 --> 00:34:05,379
[chuckles]

676
00:34:08,422 --> 00:34:09,675
Lily's never said.

677
00:34:10,551 --> 00:34:12,219
What happened with you and Mrs. C?

678
00:34:12,844 --> 00:34:15,097
Same thing that happens
in every relationship.

679
00:34:16,431 --> 00:34:18,516
When it started out, it was unreal…

680
00:34:20,643 --> 00:34:22,271
then it got real.

681
00:34:22,353 --> 00:34:23,563
[chuckles]

682
00:34:29,485 --> 00:34:30,696
Um…

683
00:34:31,405 --> 00:34:33,949
We used to bike out to this place
by the lake.

684
00:34:34,783 --> 00:34:37,411
You know, read, eat, whatever.

685
00:34:39,204 --> 00:34:43,333
And then one day I saw that that place,
that spot, was for sale.

686
00:34:43,417 --> 00:34:45,043
Now, we were young. We had nothing.

687
00:34:45,627 --> 00:34:48,338
But I said,
"Someday, we should live here."

688
00:34:48,422 --> 00:34:53,385
And then she said,
with that smile in her voice,

689
00:34:55,304 --> 00:34:58,098
"Why wait?
Why save the good stuff for later?

690
00:34:58,182 --> 00:35:00,893
Don't we deserve some good stuff
along the way?"

691
00:35:01,768 --> 00:35:03,103
Ah…

692
00:35:03,187 --> 00:35:04,229
She was right.

693
00:35:04,313 --> 00:35:06,982
-Which happens occasionally.
-[Wren chuckles]

694
00:35:10,027 --> 00:35:11,486
Well…

695
00:35:11,570 --> 00:35:13,822
We saved and we scrambled,
and next thing you know,

696
00:35:13,906 --> 00:35:16,742
I'm building the perfect house
in the perfect spot.

697
00:35:21,914 --> 00:35:25,125
So, I was busy.
I was working, paying off our debt.

698
00:35:25,209 --> 00:35:26,752
I was tired. She was tired.

699
00:35:29,129 --> 00:35:32,257
Then, pretty soon, it didn't feel like
we were married at all.

700
00:35:33,967 --> 00:35:35,511
Just felt like we were…

701
00:35:37,304 --> 00:35:40,557
running a day care camp
with someone I used to go out with.

702
00:35:44,436 --> 00:35:47,523
We were sniping. We were fighting.
We were tearing each other down.

703
00:35:47,606 --> 00:35:50,651
And I thought,
if I could just get her in that house…

704
00:35:52,569 --> 00:35:53,737
it'd fix everything.

705
00:35:56,448 --> 00:35:57,658
Make everything okay.

706
00:36:01,161 --> 00:36:05,874
So, one night I get a call
from the people who lived across the lake.

707
00:36:07,543 --> 00:36:10,045
They said they'd seen these flames.

708
00:36:12,130 --> 00:36:13,340
[chuckles]

709
00:36:16,301 --> 00:36:20,138
By the time I got there, it was just ash.

710
00:36:23,684 --> 00:36:26,854
Three weeks later, we were done.

711
00:36:29,523 --> 00:36:30,691
Over a house?

712
00:36:31,942 --> 00:36:33,569
Seemed like a lot more than that.

713
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:39,908
Good night, Wren.

714
00:36:49,668 --> 00:36:51,461
[birds chirping]

715
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,552
[Paul] Hey, it's looking like
I'm not going to make it

716
00:36:58,635 --> 00:36:59,803
till the morning of the wedding.

717
00:36:59,887 --> 00:37:02,723
Uh, I'm so sorry, baby. How's Lily?

718
00:37:02,806 --> 00:37:03,807
Crazy in love.

719
00:37:03,891 --> 00:37:05,100
That's fantastic!

720
00:37:05,184 --> 00:37:06,935
-It's terrible.
-I couldn't agree more.

721
00:37:07,019 --> 00:37:08,145
She's making a mistake.

722
00:37:08,228 --> 00:37:10,397
And now there's some kind of ceremony.

723
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:13,066
Gede and Lily exchange rings.
It's a whole thing.

724
00:37:13,150 --> 00:37:14,818
They're not doing the rings
at the wedding?

725
00:37:14,902 --> 00:37:16,403
There's not gonna be a wedding.

726
00:37:16,486 --> 00:37:19,656
I won't let her throw her life away
on some insanely handsome guy

727
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:21,992
who happens to live
in the most beautiful place on earth.

728
00:37:22,075 --> 00:37:24,369
And yes, I do know how that sounds,
but I'm still right.

729
00:37:24,453 --> 00:37:26,622
[chuckles] You're always right, baby.

730
00:37:26,705 --> 00:37:27,706
We got action.

731
00:37:27,789 --> 00:37:29,416
I'm really not. Gotta go.

732
00:37:29,499 --> 00:37:30,876
[stammers]

733
00:37:33,587 --> 00:37:34,630
-Talk to me.
-All right.

734
00:37:34,713 --> 00:37:36,381
The happy couple's
about to stand up there.

735
00:37:36,465 --> 00:37:37,758
The ring bearer brings two rings

736
00:37:37,841 --> 00:37:40,135
that have been blessed by the hat guy
for them to exchange.

737
00:37:40,219 --> 00:37:41,553
But if they don't,

738
00:37:41,637 --> 00:37:43,680
it messes with the whole
"right place, right time"--

739
00:37:43,764 --> 00:37:45,307
-We steal the rings.
-I was about to say that.

740
00:37:45,390 --> 00:37:46,683
But you didn't. So it's my idea.

741
00:37:46,767 --> 00:37:49,603
Okay, well,
the ring bearer is Gede's cousin.

742
00:37:50,145 --> 00:37:51,939
[children chattering]

743
00:37:53,273 --> 00:37:54,274
Why me?

744
00:37:54,358 --> 00:37:55,817
The hard stuff was always your thing.

745
00:37:55,901 --> 00:37:59,071
My thing was taking out the garbage
and getting things off of high shelves.

746
00:37:59,154 --> 00:38:01,823
Not that high, really.
And flattery won't work.

747
00:38:01,907 --> 00:38:03,784
-But you'll do it anyway.
-Why?

748
00:38:03,867 --> 00:38:05,577
Because it was your idea.

749
00:38:10,499 --> 00:38:13,502
[children shouting, laughing]

750
00:38:15,879 --> 00:38:17,005
[Georgia] Hey, guys!

751
00:38:17,089 --> 00:38:19,383
[child]
Can you play a chasing game with us?

752
00:38:19,466 --> 00:38:20,884
Can I show you something first?

753
00:38:20,968 --> 00:38:21,969
Ah!

754
00:38:22,052 --> 00:38:24,054
Let me show you something.
'Cause, see, I'm from America,

755
00:38:24,137 --> 00:38:27,891
and in America,
we eat bananas a little differently.

756
00:38:27,975 --> 00:38:31,687
We slice them before we peel them.

757
00:38:31,770 --> 00:38:33,772
[children] Not true!

758
00:38:33,856 --> 00:38:35,065
Totally true!

759
00:38:36,149 --> 00:38:38,527
Here, I'll show you.
Come here. Come sit up here.

760
00:38:40,571 --> 00:38:43,073
All right. See this banana?
Totally normal-looking, right?

761
00:38:43,156 --> 00:38:44,741
-It's not cut on the outside.
-Not cut.

762
00:38:44,825 --> 00:38:47,578
All right. So, I want you to take it--
Here, put your bag down.

763
00:38:47,661 --> 00:38:49,204
You're gonna take it and peel it.

764
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:55,836
[children] Whoa!

765
00:38:58,881 --> 00:39:00,132
That's how it's done.

766
00:39:01,717 --> 00:39:03,594
[children giggling]

767
00:39:06,263 --> 00:39:08,098
[Gede]
So the rings that we'll give each other

768
00:39:08,182 --> 00:39:11,977
have been blessed in the sacred water
of Pura Ulun Danu Batur.

769
00:39:13,478 --> 00:39:14,563
I do the hard stuff.

770
00:39:17,482 --> 00:39:19,651
Can't believe
they fell for the banana trick.

771
00:39:20,319 --> 00:39:22,279
It really kills you
that you haven't figured it out.

772
00:39:22,362 --> 00:39:23,280
Ah…

773
00:39:23,363 --> 00:39:25,657
Maybe we'll show them to you.
Uh, Ketut has them.

774
00:39:25,741 --> 00:39:26,742
Ketut?

775
00:39:26,825 --> 00:39:28,744
Here we go.

776
00:39:28,827 --> 00:39:29,828
[Gede] Hey!

777
00:39:30,913 --> 00:39:32,497
Can you show us the rings? Yeah?

778
00:39:34,458 --> 00:39:37,878
Hmm, where are the rings?
There's nothing in there.

779
00:39:37,961 --> 00:39:39,713
-Shh.
-[Gede] It's empty.

780
00:39:40,631 --> 00:39:42,257
-[sighs] It's gone.
-Okay.

781
00:39:42,341 --> 00:39:44,176
-[Georgia clears throat]
-[David] Mmm?

782
00:39:44,927 --> 00:39:46,720
[speaking Balinese]

783
00:39:46,803 --> 00:39:47,804
[whispers] Losi!

784
00:39:50,807 --> 00:39:51,892
What is he saying?

785
00:39:51,975 --> 00:39:53,810
-I wasn't listening.
-Cool.

786
00:39:55,395 --> 00:39:59,316
Uh, "We have to have the rings
for the circumstances to be right."

787
00:39:59,399 --> 00:40:00,400
Yeah.

788
00:40:01,485 --> 00:40:03,487
[Losi] Now no one knows what to do.

789
00:40:03,570 --> 00:40:05,113
And Ketut is crying.

790
00:40:05,197 --> 00:40:06,657
Ah…

791
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:08,200
Hey, sweetie, it's okay.

792
00:40:08,283 --> 00:40:10,786
-Tell her it's gonna be okay.
-[Gede] It's not gonna be okay.

793
00:40:10,869 --> 00:40:13,038
Look, if we don't have the rings,
then we can't--

794
00:40:17,918 --> 00:40:19,378
You're right. It's not a problem.

795
00:40:19,461 --> 00:40:20,462
We'll find other rings.

796
00:40:20,546 --> 00:40:24,216
Yeah. Did you hear that? It's fine.
We'll just do it another day. It's okay.

797
00:40:32,057 --> 00:40:33,058
How do they look?

798
00:40:34,101 --> 00:40:35,561
I'll do the stretch thing.

799
00:40:35,644 --> 00:40:36,728
The classic.

800
00:40:37,771 --> 00:40:39,481
[groans]

801
00:40:41,108 --> 00:40:42,401
Disappointed.

802
00:40:42,484 --> 00:40:43,819
-That's good.
-Is it?

803
00:40:43,902 --> 00:40:44,903
What do you mean?

804
00:40:44,987 --> 00:40:47,030
I mean, our daughter looks like
her dog just died.

805
00:40:47,114 --> 00:40:49,032
I don't know if I feel great about that.

806
00:40:49,658 --> 00:40:51,869
-We're nearly there.
-Where?

807
00:40:52,536 --> 00:40:53,620
You'll see.

808
00:40:55,289 --> 00:40:56,874
[whispers] I think he knows.

809
00:40:56,957 --> 00:40:58,458
He doesn't know.

810
00:41:00,377 --> 00:41:02,087
-Okay.
-[engine stops]

811
00:41:02,671 --> 00:41:04,798
-Are they here?
-They're here.

812
00:41:04,882 --> 00:41:05,883
Who's here?

813
00:41:09,678 --> 00:41:11,597
[dolphin whistles]

814
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:13,182
-[whispers] Dolphins.
-[chuckles]

815
00:41:14,683 --> 00:41:15,976
[whistling]

816
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:17,561
Are you kidding?

817
00:41:17,644 --> 00:41:19,730
[chuckles] It gets better.

818
00:41:22,774 --> 00:41:23,775
What are you doing?

819
00:41:24,443 --> 00:41:25,777
Ah, don't be afraid, Mr. Cotton.

820
00:41:26,653 --> 00:41:27,654
I'm not afraid.

821
00:41:27,738 --> 00:41:29,323
-[Georgia] You are.
-No, I'm not.

822
00:41:29,907 --> 00:41:31,783
I'm not afraid. Whoo!

823
00:41:31,867 --> 00:41:32,910
[David] Hey!

824
00:41:33,827 --> 00:41:35,454
[dolphins whistle, click]

825
00:41:36,205 --> 00:41:37,956
Oh, my God. This is amazing!

826
00:41:39,958 --> 00:41:42,252
[whistling, clicking continues]

827
00:41:44,254 --> 00:41:45,839
[Georgia] Whoo!

828
00:41:46,924 --> 00:41:48,258
[laughing]

829
00:41:56,141 --> 00:41:57,142
[chuckles] Mom.

830
00:42:00,062 --> 00:42:01,897
[David] Hey, are you sure
they're not sharks?

831
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:02,981
[Gede] They're not sharks.

832
00:42:03,065 --> 00:42:05,651
They might be working with the sharks,
you know, to get us.

833
00:42:05,734 --> 00:42:08,612
-Don't miss out. Come on. Get in.
-Come on. Don't be a chicken.

834
00:42:08,695 --> 00:42:10,113
-I'm not chicken.
-Come on, chicken.

835
00:42:10,197 --> 00:42:12,991
-Oh, stop it.
-You've turned chicken in your old age.

836
00:42:13,075 --> 00:42:14,451
-I'm chicken?
-[Georgia] Come on, David!

837
00:42:14,535 --> 00:42:16,495
-I'll show you chicken.
-[Georgia clucking]

838
00:42:16,578 --> 00:42:18,080
I'll go. Let's go!

839
00:42:18,163 --> 00:42:19,665
[shouts]

840
00:42:20,207 --> 00:42:21,416
[laughs]

841
00:42:22,251 --> 00:42:23,585
[whistling, clicking]

842
00:42:25,963 --> 00:42:27,673
-[screams]
-Ooh…

843
00:42:27,756 --> 00:42:29,550
Can't believe I got bit by a dolphin.

844
00:42:29,633 --> 00:42:30,968
-You were grazed.
-[David groans]

845
00:42:31,051 --> 00:42:33,220
-This has never happened before.
-Yeah.

846
00:42:33,303 --> 00:42:34,304
Dad?

847
00:42:34,388 --> 00:42:35,514
-Dad? Dad!
-[grunting, groaning]

848
00:42:35,597 --> 00:42:37,474
[Lily] Be careful with him. Does it hurt?

849
00:42:37,558 --> 00:42:39,893
I bet it was that crazy-looking one
with the smile.

850
00:42:39,977 --> 00:42:40,978
All dolphins smile.

851
00:42:41,061 --> 00:42:42,145
Now we know why.

852
00:42:42,229 --> 00:42:43,647
-It wasn't Gede's fault.
-Yeah.

853
00:42:43,730 --> 00:42:45,274
We know. These things happen.

854
00:42:45,357 --> 00:42:47,192
No, he did just say they don't.

855
00:42:47,276 --> 00:42:49,194
Georgia, can you please apply pressure?

856
00:42:49,278 --> 00:42:51,196
I'm gonna go grab some bandages.

857
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:52,948
We wouldn't want you to lose your leg.

858
00:42:53,031 --> 00:42:54,324
What?

859
00:42:54,408 --> 00:42:56,326
Enough things
have already been lost today.

860
00:42:59,454 --> 00:43:00,622
Oh, yeah. He knows.

861
00:43:01,665 --> 00:43:03,292
-Does it hurt when I do that?
-What's wrong with you?

862
00:43:03,375 --> 00:43:05,669
-He said, "Pressure. Georgia, pressure."
-Stop! [groans]

863
00:43:08,255 --> 00:43:09,631
[Lily] It's like I looked up and realized

864
00:43:09,715 --> 00:43:12,176
that everything I ever wanted
was right in front of me.

865
00:43:12,759 --> 00:43:15,262
I mean, I could go back
and try and make a go of it,

866
00:43:15,345 --> 00:43:19,266
but I just know that every second
I'd be dreaming of being here…

867
00:43:21,143 --> 00:43:22,144
with him.

868
00:43:23,061 --> 00:43:25,772
You know, it's like you always say,
why save the good stuff for later?

869
00:43:27,441 --> 00:43:29,193
Yeah, I do.

870
00:43:31,111 --> 00:43:32,196
I do.

871
00:43:32,279 --> 00:43:35,032
Excuse me. I'd like to get these.

872
00:43:35,115 --> 00:43:36,200
You're tourists, yes?

873
00:43:36,283 --> 00:43:39,119
Uh, well, she is, but I live here now.

874
00:43:40,078 --> 00:43:42,039
Ah, then we haggle.

875
00:43:42,122 --> 00:43:45,501
Oh. Uh, no, we don't need to haggle.
Just give me a fair price.

876
00:43:46,376 --> 00:43:47,836
Tourists like it when we haggle.

877
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:49,963
Americans like make good deals.

878
00:43:50,047 --> 00:43:52,132
800,000 rupiah?

879
00:43:52,216 --> 00:43:53,509
Okay.

880
00:43:53,592 --> 00:43:56,178
[whispers] No, no. You say 500,000.

881
00:43:58,138 --> 00:43:59,264
Just go with it, Mom.

882
00:44:00,015 --> 00:44:02,601
Um… 500,000.

883
00:44:02,684 --> 00:44:05,395
Enough, please. You're killing me.
Seven.

884
00:44:05,479 --> 00:44:07,481
Six. Or I'm walking away.

885
00:44:07,564 --> 00:44:09,274
We have a deal. [chuckles]

886
00:44:10,275 --> 00:44:11,318
Thank you.

887
00:44:12,194 --> 00:44:14,905
[sighs]
I'm just so crazy grateful for you, Mom.

888
00:44:14,988 --> 00:44:16,573
There's no need.

889
00:44:16,657 --> 00:44:18,075
Yes, there is.

890
00:44:18,158 --> 00:44:20,410
This is the biggest decision
I've ever made in my life.

891
00:44:20,494 --> 00:44:22,871
You came halfway around the world
to have my back.

892
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:28,502
[sighs] You are a very kind woman.
Thank you.

893
00:44:29,419 --> 00:44:31,046
I'm really not. I--

894
00:44:34,424 --> 00:44:37,010
I don't know what this is, but I like it.

895
00:44:37,094 --> 00:44:38,679
Yeah, it's called a martabak.

896
00:44:39,429 --> 00:44:40,430
Martabak?

897
00:44:41,557 --> 00:44:44,434
Listen, um,
Lily and I will get other rings,

898
00:44:44,518 --> 00:44:46,854
but it would be much better
if you just give them back.

899
00:44:46,937 --> 00:44:49,022
What are you talking about?
I don't have your rings.

900
00:44:49,106 --> 00:44:51,900
[chuckles] I didn't say anything
to Lily, and I won't.

901
00:44:51,984 --> 00:44:54,278
But, Mr. Cotton, I need you and Georgia
to stop now, please.

902
00:44:54,361 --> 00:44:55,279
You know what I think?

903
00:44:55,362 --> 00:44:58,532
You didn't say anything to Lily because
you're afraid she might be having doubts.

904
00:44:58,615 --> 00:44:59,825
And if you did say something,

905
00:44:59,908 --> 00:45:02,494
she might listen to those doubts.
Or worse, she might act on them.

906
00:45:02,578 --> 00:45:05,163
I haven't told Lily because I know
it would hurt her very much to know

907
00:45:05,247 --> 00:45:07,082
the reason her parents
are finally getting along

908
00:45:07,165 --> 00:45:09,251
is because they're united
to sabotage her relationship.

909
00:45:09,334 --> 00:45:11,211
If anyone here is afraid, it's you.

910
00:45:12,588 --> 00:45:14,339
I'm not here
to steal your daughter from you.

911
00:45:14,423 --> 00:45:15,716
That's the last thing I want to do.

912
00:45:15,799 --> 00:45:17,885
She's not a competition to be won or lost.

913
00:45:19,344 --> 00:45:20,512
Look, trust me.

914
00:45:20,596 --> 00:45:22,973
If Lily finds out
what you two are really doing,

915
00:45:23,056 --> 00:45:24,558
you'll most certainly lose her then.

916
00:45:26,476 --> 00:45:27,686
Enjoy your martabak.

917
00:45:33,233 --> 00:45:36,403
[Georgia] Remind me, were the guys
in the Trojan horse the good guys?

918
00:45:36,486 --> 00:45:37,905
Good or bad, they won the war.

919
00:45:37,988 --> 00:45:39,364
And what was the war about exactly?

920
00:45:39,448 --> 00:45:41,241
-Don't do this, Georgia.
-Do you think we're wrong?

921
00:45:41,325 --> 00:45:43,118
-We're not wrong.
-I think we might be wrong.

922
00:45:43,202 --> 00:45:46,038
Remember when we agreed
to do this together? To be in lockstep?

923
00:45:46,121 --> 00:45:48,957
Yeah, but that was before we saw her.
Saw them.

924
00:45:49,041 --> 00:45:50,417
You know-- [groans]

925
00:45:50,501 --> 00:45:53,003
Great. Classic. You win again.

926
00:45:53,086 --> 00:45:54,254
What does that even mean?

927
00:45:54,338 --> 00:45:56,882
You know what? I had Lily one day a week
and every other weekend.

928
00:45:56,965 --> 00:45:59,134
You had her all the rest of the time.

929
00:45:59,218 --> 00:46:01,386
She listened to you, she relied on you,

930
00:46:01,470 --> 00:46:04,348
and now you get to be the one
that gives her everything she wants.

931
00:46:04,431 --> 00:46:06,099
I never get to give her what she wants.

932
00:46:06,183 --> 00:46:08,852
Yes, I was there for her.
To make the rules, to fight with.

933
00:46:08,936 --> 00:46:11,522
You were fun Dad. You would breeze in,
take her where she wanted to go,

934
00:46:11,605 --> 00:46:13,357
buy her anything she wanted,
then drop her off.

935
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:15,317
-I didn't want that.
-Then you shouldn't have left.

936
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:16,652
-I had to. It was over.
-Why?

937

01:00:23,123 --> 01:00:24,291
Thank you. [chuckles]

1249
01:00:25,209 --> 01:00:26,210
I--

1250
01:00:27,794 --> 01:00:30,380
[slurring] I trust you.

1251
01:00:30,464 --> 01:00:32,424
Yeah. Thank you.

1252
01:00:32,508 --> 01:00:34,301
[chuckles]

1253
01:00:34,384 --> 01:00:35,802
Why are you being weird?

1254
01:00:35,886 --> 01:00:38,430
[slurring]
I think maybe I just got bit by something.

1255
01:00:38,514 --> 01:00:40,724
-Really?
-Oh, a snake!

1256
01:00:40,807 --> 01:00:42,476
[Georgia screams]

1257
01:00:43,644 --> 01:00:45,103
Ah, that's no good.

1258
01:00:45,687 --> 01:00:47,773
-Oh, shit.
-[groaning]

1259
01:00:47,856 --> 01:00:49,900
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. [shouts]

1260
01:00:49,983 --> 01:00:51,193
-It's wet.
-Where is it?

1261
01:00:51,276 --> 01:00:53,987
Oh, my God, there it is.
Um, what do we do?

1262
01:00:54,071 --> 01:00:56,073
-What do we do?
-Do something.

1263
01:00:56,156 --> 01:00:57,991
Okay. Um…

1264
01:00:58,075 --> 01:00:59,076
Anything.

1265
01:00:59,868 --> 01:01:01,161
-[groans]
-Okay.

1266
01:01:06,208 --> 01:01:07,793
[grunts, spits]

1267
01:01:08,544 --> 01:01:09,545
You're amazing.

1268
01:01:10,170 --> 01:01:12,506
I think-- I think I got most of it.

1269
01:01:14,007 --> 01:01:15,634
I think I got most of it.

1270
01:01:17,761 --> 01:01:20,931
Well, he will experience
some numbness in his extremities

1271
01:01:21,014 --> 01:01:23,809
and a little wooziness
from the pills I just gave him,

1272
01:01:23,892 --> 01:01:25,811
but no lasting effect.

1273
01:01:25,894 --> 01:01:27,521
Not like getting bit by a dolphin.

1274
01:01:27,604 --> 01:01:28,605
All right.

1275
01:01:29,314 --> 01:01:30,607
You saved my life.

1276
01:01:31,733 --> 01:01:32,734
I really didn't.

1277
01:01:33,235 --> 01:01:35,904
We just heard.
What an adventure.

1278
01:01:36,655 --> 01:01:37,948
-Are you okay?
-[Paul] I'm okay.

1279
01:01:38,532 --> 01:01:39,950
Thanks to my warrior queen.

1280
01:01:40,033 --> 01:01:42,411
-My Georgia. [chuckles]
-Okay.

1281
01:01:42,494 --> 01:01:44,454
{\an8}[in Balinese]

1282
01:01:49,293 --> 01:01:51,336
-What are you talking about?
-Hmm?

1283
01:01:51,879 --> 01:01:52,880
Snakes.

1284
01:01:53,547 --> 01:01:54,798
Hmm.

1285
01:01:54,882 --> 01:01:56,008
[Losi] We should let him sleep.

1286
01:01:56,091 --> 01:01:58,802
He's going to be fine,
but don't do that again.

1287
01:01:59,511 --> 01:02:01,096
-[David] All right.
-[Gede] Let's go.

1288
01:02:01,180 --> 01:02:02,431
-Okay.
-Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

1289
01:02:02,514 --> 01:02:06,018
We'll let you get some rest, okay?
But don't worry. I'll stay right here.

1290
01:02:06,101 --> 01:02:09,313
Oh, oh, oh. You remember
that important thing that I asked you?

1291
01:02:09,396 --> 01:02:10,898
Oh, yeah. Yep.

1292
01:02:12,065 --> 01:02:13,358
What did he ask you?

1293
01:02:14,276 --> 01:02:15,277
To marry him.

1294
01:02:17,196 --> 01:02:18,197
That's wonderful.

1295
01:02:18,280 --> 01:02:19,323
What?

1296
01:02:19,406 --> 01:02:21,408
Maybe not for everybody.

1297
01:02:21,491 --> 01:02:23,243
Sorry, I get that he's nice and all, but--

1298
01:02:23,327 --> 01:02:24,578
What's wrong with nice?

1299
01:02:25,662 --> 01:02:26,788
Uh…

1300
01:02:26,872 --> 01:02:30,042
Only that after a couple more years of it,
you'll be begging to watch paint dry.

1301
01:02:30,125 --> 01:02:31,418
Excuse me?

1302
01:02:31,502 --> 01:02:35,923
I mean, Mom, you're so amazing
and educated, tough, smart and beautiful.

1303
01:02:36,006 --> 01:02:38,342
But you're never your best self with him.

1304
01:02:38,425 --> 01:02:43,305
Yeah, he's kind and he's got those eyes.
But it's not enough.

1305
01:02:45,766 --> 01:02:48,310
Being loved is not the same as loving.

1306
01:02:50,062 --> 01:02:53,148
Plus, the whole surprising thing?
[chuckles]

1307
01:02:54,066 --> 01:02:57,653
[Paul] It's actually just a curtain
between us, so I heard all of that.

1308
01:03:18,298 --> 01:03:19,424
I feel bad.

1309
01:03:21,134 --> 01:03:23,387
Well, she didn't say she said yes.

1310
01:03:26,348 --> 01:03:27,808
How would you feel if she did?

1311
01:03:29,810 --> 01:03:33,355
Like hearing an old friend you barely
talk to anymore is getting married.

1312
01:03:34,064 --> 01:03:37,985
You're happy for them,
but you don't feel the need to buy a gift.

1313
01:03:40,320 --> 01:03:42,281
Since when were you guys old friends?

1314
01:03:44,741 --> 01:03:45,742
Ah…

1315
01:03:46,326 --> 01:03:48,036
That's the way it goes.

1316
01:03:48,120 --> 01:03:49,162
Stuff happens.

1317
01:03:50,455 --> 01:03:52,416
Things change and you move on.

1318
01:03:56,837 --> 01:03:58,005
Just move on.

1319
01:04:10,809 --> 01:04:13,812
She doesn't get to tell me what to do.
Can you believe it?

1320
01:04:13,896 --> 01:04:17,191
I'm sorry, baby. I'm a little woozy.
Am I supposed to believe it?

1321
01:04:17,274 --> 01:04:18,275
[Georgia] No.

1322
01:04:18,358 --> 01:04:19,735
No. Right, I can't.

1323
01:04:19,818 --> 01:04:22,529
-I know you're thinking I'm a hypocrite.
-Am I?

1324
01:04:22,613 --> 01:04:24,239
And you're probably right.

1325
01:04:24,323 --> 01:04:25,407
Oh, good.

1326
01:04:25,490 --> 01:04:29,036
I mean, who are we to say that
Lily doesn't know what's best for herself?

1327
01:04:29,119 --> 01:04:30,120
And if she does,

1328
01:04:30,204 --> 01:04:33,665
if she's truly definitively certain
that she loves and is loved, then--

1329
01:04:33,749 --> 01:04:35,751
Oh, David is with them. [groans]

1330
01:04:35,834 --> 01:04:37,419
David is with Gede and Lily now.

1331
01:04:37,503 --> 01:04:40,797
-Oh. Right, so he can break them up.
-No. I don't want him to break them up.

1332
01:04:40,881 --> 01:04:42,257
-Damn this medication.
-[scoffs]

1333
01:04:43,550 --> 01:04:45,135
I have to do something.

1334
01:04:45,219 --> 01:04:46,261
Take this.

1335
01:04:46,887 --> 01:04:48,514
[coughs]

1336
01:04:48,597 --> 01:04:50,265
I'm sorry. This will help you sleep.

1337
01:04:50,349 --> 01:04:51,683
[slurping]

1338
01:04:51,767 --> 01:04:54,061
-All right. Cool. Feel better.
-[coughs]

1339
01:04:54,144 --> 01:04:56,897
You know,
I'm a highly trained commercial pilot.

1340
01:04:56,980 --> 01:04:59,024
I can go weeks without sleep.

1341
01:05:16,625 --> 01:05:18,377
[Lily] The best place on earth.

1342
01:05:18,460 --> 01:05:22,589
[chuckles] Well, to be fair,
I haven't been to all the other places.

1343
01:05:22,673 --> 01:05:24,883
Your mother is gonna be so jealous.

1344
01:05:24,967 --> 01:05:27,594
I'll send her a picture
as soon as I get a signal.

1345
01:05:27,678 --> 01:05:28,679
[Georgia] No need.

1346
01:05:35,769 --> 01:05:36,770
[Lily] Mom!

1347
01:05:37,479 --> 01:05:38,856
Hey.

1348
01:05:38,939 --> 01:05:42,526
Hey, I'm so sorry about before.
I guess I was just surprised.

1349
01:05:42,609 --> 01:05:44,319
Of course your choices
are your choices.

1350
01:05:44,403 --> 01:05:47,239
Well, I haven't made any choices yet.

1351
01:05:47,990 --> 01:05:48,991
[Lily] Oh.

1352
01:05:50,284 --> 01:05:51,285
Okay.

1353
01:05:51,368 --> 01:05:52,995
-[Georgia] Hi, gents.
-Hey.

1354
01:05:53,078 --> 01:05:54,329
Is, uh, Paul okay?

1355
01:05:54,413 --> 01:05:55,539
He's sleeping.

1356
01:05:55,622 --> 01:05:56,623
How can you tell?

1357
01:05:57,624 --> 01:05:59,334
God, look at this view.

1358
01:06:01,003 --> 01:06:02,004
Yeah.

1359
01:06:05,007 --> 01:06:06,091
Is that my boat?

1360
01:06:08,760 --> 01:06:09,761
[Lily] Is it drifting?

1361
01:06:11,263 --> 01:06:13,640
Nah, it's just rising with the tide.

1362
01:06:13,724 --> 01:06:14,808
It's floating away.

1363
01:06:14,892 --> 01:06:16,143
You did tie my boat up?

1364
01:06:16,226 --> 01:06:18,061
Yeah, I tied it. Tied it to a log.

1365
01:06:21,857 --> 01:06:23,150
That's not good.

1366
01:06:26,069 --> 01:06:28,030
[birds chirping]

1367
01:06:28,655 --> 01:06:30,574
[David] How far are we
from the nearest village?

1368
01:06:30,657 --> 01:06:33,452
[Gede] Too far to walk.
Plus, it's getting dark.

1369
01:06:33,535 --> 01:06:35,245
[Georgia] I still can't get a signal.

1370
01:06:35,787 --> 01:06:37,206
[Lily] What are we gonna do?

1371
01:06:37,289 --> 01:06:39,166
[Gede] Camp here for the night.

1372
01:06:39,249 --> 01:06:41,418
A lot of people come to see the sunrise,

1373
01:06:41,502 --> 01:06:43,754
so we can get a ride
in time for our wedding.

1374
01:06:43,837 --> 01:06:46,590
-[Lily] Is that gonna work?
-Yeah, with hours to spare.

1375
01:06:47,382 --> 01:06:50,010
Uh, Georgia,
can you and Lily build a fire?

1376
01:06:50,093 --> 01:06:51,094
On it, yeah.

1377
01:06:51,178 --> 01:06:54,014
Mr. Cotton,
you and I will track down some food.

1378
01:06:54,097 --> 01:06:55,682
Hmm. What kind of food?

1379
01:06:55,766 --> 01:06:57,643
I've seen some wild pigs around.

1380
01:06:59,311 --> 01:07:01,271
-[chuckles]
-We'll have to make spears.

1381
01:07:01,355 --> 01:07:03,148
[laughing]

1382
01:07:03,232 --> 01:07:05,526
What? I can hunt. I can be a hunter.

1383
01:07:05,609 --> 01:07:08,195
How do you make that part pointier?

1384
01:07:09,321 --> 01:07:12,074
-I am impressed with this situation…
-Yeah.

1385
01:07:12,157 --> 01:07:14,493
-…and I have, uh, matches in my bag.
-Okay.

1386
01:07:15,619 --> 01:07:19,164
You know, I don't think I've actually
successfully started a fire before.

1387
01:07:19,248 --> 01:07:21,667
Oh, really? What about
your eighth birthday, hmm?

1388
01:07:21,750 --> 01:07:24,378
Uh, well, never on purpose.
[chuckles]

1389
01:07:24,461 --> 01:07:26,797
Oh, God,
we had some good parties.

1390
01:07:26,880 --> 01:07:28,423
Do you remember
your tenth birthday?

1391
01:07:28,507 --> 01:07:30,217
-The clown came and he was drunk?
-Mom?

1392
01:07:30,300 --> 01:07:32,553
-No, he was a magician. But he was--
-Mom.

1393
01:07:42,104 --> 01:07:44,398
[snorting]

1394
01:07:47,776 --> 01:07:49,778
[whispers]
All right. You're the closest.

1395
01:07:50,404 --> 01:07:52,239
I think it's closer to you than me.

1396
01:07:53,532 --> 01:07:54,575
Okay. Hey.

1397
01:07:55,784 --> 01:07:57,744
-On my count. Okay?
-Okay.

1398
01:07:58,662 --> 01:07:59,663
One…

1399
01:08:03,208 --> 01:08:04,877
-Three.
-[grunting]

1400
01:08:04,960 --> 01:08:06,920
-[Lily] Dad!
-[pig squealing]

1401
01:08:07,880 --> 01:08:10,257
What are you doing?
We absolutely had it!

1402
01:08:10,340 --> 01:08:11,383
I cannot believe you.

1403
01:08:11,466 --> 01:08:13,927
-You're the one that scared it away.

That's great. Where? [chuckles]

1407

In Mom's bag.

1408

-I knew it.
-What?

1409

-I knew it.
-She wasn't working alone because--

-Wait, what?
-You left it in the bag?

1411
01:08:28,734 --> 01:08:31,236
-What do you mean you knew?
-What was I to do with them?

1412
01:08:31,319 --> 01:08:33,113
-Throw it away.
-I'm sorry. I couldn't tell you.

1413
01:08:33,197 --> 01:08:34,406
-Where?
-In the trash, ocean, anywhere.

-Can you stop talking about the rings?

I can't believe this is happening.

1416

My parents have been
trying to sabotage my wedding.

1417
01:08:40,412 --> 01:08:42,331
My fiancé knew about it
and didn't bother to tell me.

1418

We're just trying to do
what's best for you.

1419
01:08:43,999 --> 01:08:47,377
Yeah, but you had no respect
for my opinion of what that might be.

1420

You're just like all parents,
acting like you're giving your kid

1421
01:08:53,050 --> 01:08:55,594
this great advice for their own good,
but all you're really doing

trying to rewrite the past

get through to me back then.

the greatest mistake of my life.

I'll talk to her.
I'll tell her it was my idea.

You weren't.

It's been the story for years that you
were the one to blame. It's not true.

1443
01:10:35,861 --> 01:10:40,282
I was loving being a mom.

1444
01:10:43,285 --> 01:10:47,789
But I started to feel like
I was losing who I was,

1445
01:10:47,873 --> 01:10:51,043
and I thought if I'd stayed with you,

1446
01:10:51,126 --> 01:10:55,464
maybe one day
I would not recognize myself at all.

So do I.

1454

You gave up a lot
to stay on this island.

And you know I understand that.

1456

But what about me?

1457

In a year from now,

I've ever been in my life,

1559
01:17:51,880 --> 01:17:53,340
Why would I cry?

1560
01:17:54,132 --> 01:17:55,717
It's not like I'm losing someone

1561
01:17:55,801 --> 01:17:59,096
who's basically a substitute
for my entire terrible family.

1562
01:18:00,973 --> 01:18:02,182
Is my mascara okay?

1563
01:18:03,183 --> 01:18:06,645
Uh, for a clown. Let me help.

1564
01:18:08,689 --> 01:18:11,024
-[sighs]
-Do you remember when we graduated?

1565
01:18:11,108 --> 01:18:13,819
Yes, because it was two months ago.

1566
01:18:13,902 --> 01:18:15,279
-Oh…

[knocking on door]

1568
01:18:18,115 --> 01:18:22,160
Mrs. C? You're gonna have
to take it from here.

1569
01:18:22,244 --> 01:18:23,328
I just can't.

1570
01:18:30,002 --> 01:18:31,128
Hi.

1571
01:18:31,879 --> 01:18:32,880
Hi.

1572
01:18:39,303 --> 01:18:40,512
[sniffles]

1573
01:18:41,388 --> 01:18:42,389
May I?

1574
01:18:50,439 --> 01:18:51,773
You lied to me.

1575
01:18:56,028 --> 01:18:57,863
I'm so, so sorry.

[sighs]

1577
01:18:59,823 --> 01:19:03,535
It turns out a parent will do
anything in the world for their kid,

1578
01:19:03,619 --> 01:19:05,662
except let them be
exactly who they are.

1579
01:19:08,498 --> 01:19:10,834
Your dad and I
were gonna be different.

1580
01:19:13,712 --> 01:19:15,714
We were gonna be better than this.

1581
01:19:18,091 --> 01:19:20,010
I wanted to be better than this.

1582
01:19:25,849 --> 01:19:27,476
There's no one better, Mom.

1583
01:19:30,312 --> 01:19:31,355
No one.

1584
01:19:32,940 --> 01:19:34,358
Yes, there is.

1585
01:19:39,488 --> 01:19:40,948

01:19:43,450 --> 01:19:45,327
-Sweetie. Love you.

[Lily sniffles]

1588
01:19:53,085 --> 01:19:54,878
Got to get you ready
for that wedding, huh?

1589
01:19:54,962 --> 01:19:56,213
Yeah. [laughs]

1590
01:19:56,296 --> 01:19:59,007
-You're kind of a mess right now.
-I know, Mom.

1591
01:20:03,095 --> 01:20:04,888
You're a mess. You're my mess.

Can you believe I didn't
bring anything to wear to a wedding?

1599
01:21:14,833 --> 01:21:16,710
There wasn't supposed to be a wedding.

1600
01:21:18,545 --> 01:21:19,880
Doesn't look like a rental.

1601

You clean up pretty good.

And free!

01:24:17,224 --> 01:24:18,350
Thank you so much.

1618
01:24:18,433 --> 01:24:23,188
Gede will take the knife
and strike it through this pandanus,

1619
01:24:23,897 --> 01:24:29,444
to show he and Lily

Sorry, but we don't have all three.

1625
01:25:05,147 --> 01:25:07,191
Georgia. Mr. Cotton.

1626
01:25:08,442 --> 01:25:10,944
We needed your support, your blessing.

1627
01:25:12,446 --> 01:25:13,530
And we don't have it.

1628
01:25:16,158 --> 01:25:17,993
When I push this knife through this mat,

1629
01:25:18,785 --> 01:25:20,287
it is a declaration that…

1630
01:25:21,455 --> 01:25:25,417
this poem of a person and me
are now a family.

1631
01:25:27,878 --> 01:25:29,630
We can't be a family without you.

1632
01:25:31,924 --> 01:25:33,050
So I ask you.

01:25:33,133 --> 01:25:34,134
Please.

1634
01:25:35,511 --> 01:25:36,512
For Lily and me.

1635
01:25:38,013 --> 01:25:40,974
Or we will not marry.

1636
01:25:42,351 --> 01:25:44,603
You didn't wanna run that by me first?

1637
01:25:51,568 --> 01:25:53,403
You can do the hard stuff too.

1638
01:25:57,991 --> 01:25:59,076
Um…

1639
01:26:00,577 --> 01:26:01,995
You don't need our blessing.

1640
01:26:03,038 --> 01:26:05,832
I mean, you have it. It's here, but…

1641
01:26:09,294 --> 01:26:11,505
All you two really need is each other.

1642
01:26:16,260 --> 01:26:20,681
If your mother and I had listened to
her awful parents or my dumbass friends,

1643
01:26:20,764 --> 01:26:23,267
then Lily wouldn't be here at all.

1644
01:26:23,350 --> 01:26:24,977
And I think we can all agree that…

1645
01:26:26,228 --> 01:26:29,273
the world's a lot better place
with Lily in it.

So, I…

01:26:35,737 --> 01:26:37,114
-Yeah?
-Mmm.

1648
01:26:40,993 --> 01:26:42,828
Your mother and I are on your side.

Both of you.

1650

Now and always.

01:26:48,750 --> 01:26:49,751
Yeah.

I'm just kidding.
Go for it. [chuckles]

That's my daughter.

[cheering]

1661
01:27:44,556 --> 01:27:47,100
Do you think if we'd
kicked a coconut around a few times,

1662
01:27:47,184 --> 01:27:49,353
things would have
worked out differently for us?

1663
01:27:51,188 --> 01:27:54,358
I'm sure some red and white string
couldn't have hurt.

1664
01:27:54,441 --> 01:27:55,943
[chuckles]

1665
01:27:58,904 --> 01:28:00,531
Paul proposed.

1666
01:28:00,614 --> 01:28:01,907
I know.

1667
01:28:03,075 --> 01:28:05,160
This morning,
he-- he re-proposed.

1668
01:28:06,954 --> 01:28:08,163
What did you say?

1669
01:28:09,289 --> 01:28:12,417
I asked him for some ice
because he headbutted me.

1670
01:28:12,501 --> 01:28:13,669
Hmm.

1671
01:28:15,170 --> 01:28:17,422
A lot of guys would have
gone in for a kiss at that point.

1672
01:28:17,506 --> 01:28:19,299
[both chuckle]

1673
01:28:19,383 --> 01:28:20,759
Let me see your nose.

1674
01:28:21,677 --> 01:28:22,678
Let's see.

1675
01:28:22,761 --> 01:28:23,929
Mmm.

1676
01:28:27,641 --> 01:28:28,934
I think you should say yes.

1677
01:28:35,065 --> 01:28:36,066
Paul's a good guy.

1678
01:28:36,149 --> 01:28:37,234
Mm-hmm.

1679
01:28:38,610 --> 01:28:42,364
And if he makes you half as happy

1680
01:28:42,447 --> 01:28:44,449
as we were when we were happy…

1681
01:28:48,704 --> 01:28:49,997
then you should say yes.

1682
01:28:53,208 --> 01:28:54,209
I don't know.

1683
01:28:56,628 --> 01:28:59,715
Maybe I'm too old to feel young anymore.

1684
01:29:01,341 --> 01:29:04,595
I think I missed something critical
and now it's too late.

1685
01:29:07,014 --> 01:29:08,015
Well…

1686
01:29:09,725 --> 01:29:11,643
you look like you're in your prime to me.

1687

[chuckles]

1688
01:29:17,065 --> 01:29:18,609
Even with that crooked nose.

1689
01:29:36,710 --> 01:29:38,337
-Hi.
-[guest] Hi.

1690
01:29:57,898 --> 01:29:59,274
What are you doing out here?

1691
01:30:00,651 --> 01:30:02,236
Just looking at this garbage.

1692
01:30:03,529 --> 01:30:04,863
You call that a sunset?

1693
01:30:20,838 --> 01:30:22,256
I belong here.

1694
01:30:25,717 --> 01:30:26,718
I know.

1695
01:30:34,309 --> 01:30:35,477
[chuckles]

1696
01:30:37,855 --> 01:30:39,439
Will you come and dance with me?

1697
01:30:46,238 --> 01:30:47,489
[David] Let's go dance.

1698
01:31:01,795 --> 01:31:04,381

[inhales sharply]

01:31:08,719 --> 01:31:10,137
-Hi.

1701
01:31:12,514 --> 01:31:14,057
-Did I wake you?
-No.

1702
01:31:14,766 --> 01:31:16,435
-Was I kicking? I was kicking.
-No, no, no.

1703
01:31:16,518 --> 01:31:18,604
-No, you weren't. You weren't. I was up.
-Okay.

-[sighs]
-Um…

1706
01:31:24,359 --> 01:31:26,528
Well, the ferry is only
leaving this afternoon.

1707
01:31:26,612 --> 01:31:28,405
I guess we could go paddleboarding.

1708
01:31:31,158 --> 01:31:32,868
I can't marry you, Paul.

1709
01:31:35,495 --> 01:31:37,331
It doesn't have to be
paddleboarding.

1710
01:31:38,749 --> 01:31:39,833
Uh…

1711
01:31:40,542 --> 01:31:41,793
Did I do something wrong?

1712
01:31:41,877 --> 01:31:43,795
No. No, it's just--

1713
01:31:43,879 --> 01:31:47,758
It's the wrong time, wrong place,

1714
01:31:49,134 --> 01:31:50,219
wrong girl.

1715
01:31:52,596 --> 01:31:53,764
I'm so sorry.

1716

[sighs]

1717
01:32:00,145 --> 01:32:01,146
Me too.

1718
01:32:03,023 --> 01:32:04,983
I'm not just agreeing to agree with you.

1719
01:32:12,074 --> 01:32:13,784
I'm still gonna go paddleboarding.

1720
01:32:16,411 --> 01:32:17,829
[chuckles]

1721
01:32:27,130 --> 01:32:28,131
