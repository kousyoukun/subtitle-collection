1
00:00:39,281 --> 00:00:40,537
你今晚要问她?
So you're asking her tonight?

2
00:00:40,672 --> 00:00:42,342
是的。有什么建议吗?
Yeah. Any advice?

3
00:00:42,478 --> 00:00:43,942
去做个大动作。
Go for the grand gesture.

4
00:00:44,077 --> 00:00:46,446
我以前经常做这种事。
I used to do stuff like that all the time.

5
00:00:46,581 --> 00:00:47,822
他从来没有做过那样的事。
He never did anything like that.

6
00:00:47,846 --> 00:00:49,154
这完全不是我的风格。
It was totally out of character.

7
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:50,619
40000。我有45吗?
40,000. Do I have 45?

8
00:00:50,754 --> 00:00:56,120
事实上，大卫的求婚可能是他唯一一次给我惊喜。
Actually, David's proposal was probably the only time he ever surprised me.

9
00:00:56,256 --> 00:00:58,123
她上大学的四年我们都在约会。
We dated all four years she was in college.

10
00:00:58,259 --> 00:01:02,893
我获得了建筑硕士课程的名额，所以我肯定会留在芝加哥。
I had a spot in the master's program for architecture, so I was definitely staying in Chicago.

11
00:01:03,029 --> 00:01:06,838
然后突然间，我就得到了洛杉矶一家很棒的画廊的报价七万?
Then out of nowhere, I get an offer from a great gallery in L.A. 70,000?

12
00:01:06,973 --> 00:01:09,174
- 70。- 70000。
- 70. - 70,000.

13
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:12,639
毕业典礼的前一晚…她突然告诉我她要走了。
So, the night before graduation... and she springs it on me she's leaving.

14
00:01:12,775 --> 00:01:15,048
我冷静。你知道，为她高兴。
And I'm calm. You know, happy for her.

15
00:01:15,184 --> 00:01:17,250
他完全吓坏了。
He freaks out completely.

16
00:01:18,287 --> 00:01:30,324
第二天早上，在毕业典礼上，我走到院长面前拿着我的毕业证，突然，大卫出现了，就在我旁边，单膝跪地。
So, the next morning, at the ceremony, I'm up there walking towards the dean and my diploma, and suddenly, there's David, right next to me, down on one knee.

17
00:01:30,459 --> 00:01:32,523
她开始哭。
And she starts crying.

18
00:01:32,659 --> 00:01:34,899
我很尴尬。
I'm so embarrassed.

19
00:01:35,035 --> 00:01:36,234
整个地方都爆发了。
The whole place erupts.

20
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:37,931
每个人都在鼓掌和喊叫。
Everybody's clapping and shouting.

21
00:01:38,066 --> 00:01:40,066
除了她的父母。他们认为她太年轻了。
Except her parents. They thought she was too young.

22
00:01:40,174 --> 00:01:41,504
他们认为我可以做得更好。
They thought I could do better.

23
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:44,238
但谁会听父母的话呢?
But who ever listens to their parents?

24
00:01:44,374 --> 00:01:46,213
卖给了乔治亚棉花公司。
Sold to Georgia Cotton.

25
00:01:48,373 --> 00:01:53,711
长话短说，她没有搬去加州，一个月后，我们怀了莉莉。
Long story short, she didn't move to California, and a month later, we were pregnant with Lily.

26
00:01:53,847 --> 00:01:55,117
这是惊人的。
That's amazing.

27
00:01:55,253 --> 00:01:56,514
等等，多久以前?
Wait, how long ago?

28
00:01:56,650 --> 00:01:59,453
让我来算算。
Uh, let me do the math.

29
00:01:59,589 --> 00:02:02,524
3月7日，就是25年了。
March 7th, it'll be 25 years.

30
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:04,623
难以置信，25年的婚姻。
Incredible. 25 years of marriage.

31
00:02:04,758 --> 00:02:06,931
哦,上帝。我们不结婚了。
Oh, God. We're not married.

32
00:02:07,066 --> 00:02:08,862
上帝,没有。
God, no.

33
00:02:08,997 --> 00:02:11,469
五年后我们离婚了。
We divorced five years later.

34
00:02:11,605 --> 00:02:15,442
这不是你在电视上看到的那种和平离婚。
And it's not one of those amicable divorces you see on TV.

35
00:02:15,578 --> 00:02:19,979
我尽量不去同一个时区，但莉莉明天就要毕业了，所以我来了。
I try not to be in the same time zone if I can help it, but Lily's graduating tomorrow, so here I am.

36
00:02:20,115 --> 00:02:21,573
哇，那一定很尴尬。
Wow, that's got to be awkward.

37
00:02:21,709 --> 00:02:23,476
什么?不。古老的历史。
What? No. Ancient history.

38
00:02:23,612 --> 00:02:24,775
哦,是的。
Oh, yeah.

39
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:26,785
噩梦。
Nightmare.

40
00:02:26,921 --> 00:02:28,552
请结账。
Check, please.

41
00:02:32,587 --> 00:02:34,217
你在做什么?
What are you doing?

42
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:37,162
——我包装。-你在打包工作。
- I'm packing. - You're packing work.

43
00:02:37,297 --> 00:02:38,589
不包工作。
Don't pack work.

44
00:02:38,725 --> 00:02:39,999
你为什么要打包工作?
Why would you pack work?

45
00:02:40,135 --> 00:02:42,676
因为假期很短，之后的生活很长。
Because it's a short vacation and a very long life afterwards.

46
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:47,354
是啊，我一直在想这个问题，我真的不觉得"做个大人"这件事对我有用。
Yeah, I've been thinking about that, and I really don't think this whole "being an adult" thing is gonna work out for me.

47
00:02:49,072 --> 00:02:52,107
是啊，我也没得选。
Yeah, well, I don't really have a choice.

48
00:02:52,242 --> 00:02:53,310
嘿,妈妈。
Hey, Mom.

49
00:02:53,445 --> 00:02:57,447
我在蒸我的衣服，我在想我坐在哪里。
So I'm just steaming my outfit, and I am wondering where I'm sitting.

50
00:02:57,583 --> 00:02:59,749
这并不重要。对我来说，我是说。
Not that it matters. To me, I mean.

51
00:02:59,884 --> 00:03:01,780
只是…我是说，这对我来说一点都不重要。
Just... I mean, it doesn't matter to me at all.

52
00:03:01,915 --> 00:03:05,292
那你为什么…哦,稍等。这是爸爸。
Then why did you... Oh, hang on. It's Dad.

53
00:03:06,822 --> 00:03:08,955
嗨,爸爸。妈妈在另一条线上。
Hey, Dad. Mom's on the other line.

54
00:03:09,091 --> 00:03:10,790
别替我问你好。
Don't say hi from me.

55
00:03:10,926 --> 00:03:12,364
你们不能坐在一起，好吗?
You're not sitting together, okay?

56
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:15,528
你们分别站在礼堂的两边，礼堂有罗德岛那么大。
You're on opposite sides of the auditorium, which is the size of Rhode Island.

57
00:03:15,664 --> 00:03:17,165
这是最小的状态。
That's the smallest state.

58
00:03:18,499 --> 00:03:20,198
你承诺吗?
So you promise?

59
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:24,202
没有刻薄的评论，没有争吵，没有消极的攻击?
No mean comments, no arguing, no passive aggression?

60
00:03:24,337 --> 00:03:26,809
侵略性攻击呢?是,好吗?
What about aggressive aggression? Is that okay?

61
00:03:26,944 --> 00:03:29,580
我爱你。我爱你。
I love you. I love you.

62
00:03:30,617 --> 00:03:32,981
这将是难以忍受的一天。
This is gonna be an unbearable day.

63
00:03:33,117 --> 00:03:34,553
来吧。
Come on.

64
00:03:34,688 --> 00:03:36,880
我们和一个老男人握手，戴一顶愚蠢的帽子。
We shake an old guy's hand and wear a dumb hat.

65
00:03:37,016 --> 00:03:39,618
会出什么问题呢?
What could possibly go wrong?

66
00:03:39,754 --> 00:03:41,718
他们坐在一起。
They're sitting together.

67
00:03:46,362 --> 00:03:47,530
下午好。
Good afternoon.

68
00:03:47,666 --> 00:03:49,361
打扰一下。我很抱歉。我很抱歉。
Excuse me. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

69
00:03:49,496 --> 00:03:54,407
我谨代表普尔曼大学的全体教职员工…——大日子。-是的。
On behalf of the faculty and staff of Pullman University... - Big day. - Yeah.

70
00:03:54,542 --> 00:04:00,078
我很荣幸地欢迎即将毕业的学生的父母、家人和朋友。
It is my privilege to welcome the parents, family and friends of our graduating seniors.

71
00:04:00,214 --> 00:04:01,882
你在跟我开玩笑吧。
You got to be kidding me.

72
00:04:02,017 --> 00:04:05,814
我猜这是我的座位，因为莉莉戴上牙套后你就没约过会了。
Guess this is my seat, as you haven't had a date since Lily was in braces.

73
00:04:05,949 --> 00:04:07,883
至少我约会的时候，年龄是合适的。
At least when I do date, it's age-appropriate.

74
00:04:08,019 --> 00:04:11,154
你不喜欢他只是因为他是法国人。
You just don't like him because he's French.

75
00:04:11,289 --> 00:04:12,718
我喜欢法国人。
I like the French.

76
00:04:12,853 --> 00:04:14,257
我喜欢他们的薯条和吐司。
I like their fries, their toast.

77
00:04:14,393 --> 00:04:17,299
我特别要求莉莉不要让我们坐在一起。——他们的芥末。
I specifically asked Lily - not to seat us together. - Their mustard.

78
00:04:17,323 --> 00:04:18,607
什么?你打电话给她吗?这太可悲了。
What? You called her? That's so pathetic.

79
00:04:18,631 --> 00:04:19,935
——嘘。这是开始。-别嘘我。
- Shh. It's starting. - Don't shush me.

80
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:21,501
——嘘。-别嘘我。
- Shh. - Don't shush me.

81
00:04:21,636 --> 00:04:25,699
废话不多说，现在开始点名吧。
So, without further ado, let's begin the roll call.

82
00:04:25,834 --> 00:04:28,036
巴特勒鹪鹩。
Wren Butler.

83
00:04:28,172 --> 00:04:29,838
是的!
Yes!

84
00:04:30,878 --> 00:04:32,808
Wrenny !
Wrenny!

85
00:04:37,215 --> 00:04:38,781
原谅我。
Excuse me.

86
00:04:38,916 --> 00:04:40,920
-那是我的扶手。-不，在中间。
- That's my armrest. - No, it's in the middle.

87
00:04:41,056 --> 00:04:42,389
哦，这太像你了。
Oh, this is so like you.

88
00:04:42,524 --> 00:04:44,029
-拿，拿，拿。-这不是比喻。
- Take, take, take. - It is not a metaphor.

89
00:04:44,053 --> 00:04:45,524
这是一个扶手。威尔逊张。
It is an armrest. Wilson Chang.

90
00:04:45,659 --> 00:04:47,861
请给我一半。我要一半。
Give me half, please. I would like half.

91
00:04:49,756 --> 00:04:51,056
就给我一半。
Just give me half.

92
00:04:51,192 --> 00:04:52,475
你怎么了?我只要一半!
What is wrong with you? I just want half!

93
00:04:52,499 --> 00:04:54,592
莉莉棉花。哦。嘿。
Lily Cotton. Oh. Hey.

94
00:04:57,901 --> 00:04:59,421
-拍张照片。-你拍张照片。
- Take a picture. - You take a picture.

95
00:04:59,531 --> 00:05:01,243
-我活在当下。-你为什么要照片?
- I'm in the moment. - Why do you need a picture?

96
00:05:01,267 --> 00:05:03,135
-这样我就不会忘记那个时刻。——啊。
- So I don't forget the moment. - Ah.

97
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:04,538
爱你。更爱你。
Love you. Love you more.

98
00:05:04,674 --> 00:05:06,303
——因此骄傲。——骄傲。
- So proud. - Prouder.

99
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:07,881
最骄傲的。最自豪的。
The most proud. Proudest.

100
00:05:08,017 --> 00:05:09,277
不能再骄傲了。
Couldn't be more proud.

101
00:05:09,412 --> 00:05:10,713
破裂。
Bursting.

102
00:05:10,849 --> 00:05:12,978
她长了我的鼻子。是的。是的。
She got my nose. Yeah. Yeah.

103
00:05:13,114 --> 00:05:15,213
欢迎你,亲爱的。爱你,莉莉。
You're welcome, honey. Love you, Lily.

104
00:05:16,855 --> 00:05:18,550
真不敢相信我的宝贝是律师。
I can't believe my baby's a lawyer.

105
00:05:18,685 --> 00:05:20,117
你和我都是。
You and me both.

106
00:05:20,253 --> 00:05:21,756
大家能别吵了吗?
Can everyone please stop shouting?

107
00:05:21,892 --> 00:05:23,928
——喊是谁?-你又来了
- Who's shouting? - There you go again.

108
00:05:24,063 --> 00:05:26,999
我们有些人可能喝多了7杯Jägerbombs昨晚。
Some of us maybe had seven too many Jägerbombs last night.

109
00:05:27,134 --> 00:05:28,563
只是多喝了一杯。
Just one too many.

110
00:05:28,699 --> 00:05:31,061
其他六个都是完美的。
The other six were perfection.

111
00:05:31,196 --> 00:05:33,132
嗯，去巴厘岛的飞行时间很长。
Well, it's a long flight to Bali.

112
00:05:33,267 --> 00:05:35,735
你可以在飞机上睡觉。
You can sleep on the plane.

113
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:38,069
莉莉可以在飞机上工作。
Lily can work on the plane.

114
00:05:38,205 --> 00:05:41,171
上周她至少有90个小时的考试。
She had at least 90 hours of exams in the last week.

115
00:05:41,306 --> 00:05:44,748
在接下来的三个月里，她开始在芝加哥最好的律师事务所工作。
Well, in the next three months, she starts at the top law firm in Chicago.

116
00:05:44,883 --> 00:05:47,478
你不能带着晒黑的皮肤去参加枪战。
You can't show up to a gunfight with a tan.

117
00:05:47,614 --> 00:05:49,854
好了，她需要减压，你需要冷静。
Okay, she needs to decompress, and you need to calm down.

118
00:05:49,986 --> 00:05:54,535
你知道吗，在宇宙的历史上，让别人冷静下来从来没有让任何人冷静下来过?
You know telling someone to calm down has literally never calmed anyone down in the history of the universe?

119
00:05:54,626 --> 00:05:56,161
-我知道。-你知道吗?
- I know that. - You know that?

120
00:05:56,296 --> 00:05:57,491
请里面的声音。
Inside voices, please.

121
00:05:57,626 --> 00:05:58,925
我把内裤。
I'm taking briefs.

122
00:05:59,061 --> 00:06:00,797
我要带防晒霜。我会没事的。
I'm taking sunblock. I'll be fine.

123
00:06:00,932 --> 00:06:02,632
你知道吗，就这一次，你可以支持我。
You know, for once, you could back me up.

124
00:06:02,768 --> 00:06:04,498
我可以，但那样我也错了。
I could, but then I'd be wrong, too.

125
00:06:04,634 --> 00:06:06,166
啊。好了，我们该走了。
Ugh. Okay, we should go.

126
00:06:06,302 --> 00:06:08,262
哦。你知道你做了什么吗?你把再见说砸了。
Oh. Do you see what you did? You blew the goodbye.

127
00:06:08,309 --> 00:06:09,338
-是我干的?——嗯。
- I did that? - Uh-huh.

128
00:06:09,474 --> 00:06:11,443
不只是他。再见。
It wasn't just him. Bye.

129
00:06:11,579 --> 00:06:13,707
-不只是我一个人-我爱你。
- See, it wasn't just me. - I love you.

130
00:06:13,842 --> 00:06:15,439
-嗨。再见。再见,爸爸。
- Hey. Bye. - Bye, Dad.

131
00:06:15,575 --> 00:06:17,335
大卫——再见，再见，再见，再见，再见，再见，再见，再见。
DAVID and-Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye.

132
00:06:18,417 --> 00:06:20,048
再见，莉莉的爸爸妈妈。
Bye, Lily's dad and mom.

133
00:06:20,183 --> 00:06:22,984
因为我爸妈都不知道我要去。
'Cause my dad and mom don't even know I'm going.

134
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:25,354
我爱你。是安全的。
I love you. Be safe.

135
00:06:25,489 --> 00:06:26,550
做出正确的选择。
Make good choices.

136
00:06:26,686 --> 00:06:28,294
总是这样。
Always.

137
00:06:28,429 --> 00:06:30,464
很少。
Rarely.

138
00:06:31,497 --> 00:06:32,994
和她走了。
And she's gone.

139
00:06:33,993 --> 00:06:35,529
再也见不到你了。
See you again never.

140
00:06:35,665 --> 00:06:37,330
希望不是那么快。
Hopefully not that soon.

156
00:07:28,915 --> 00:07:31,184

157
00:07:33,394 --> 00:07:35,720
哦,狗屎。他们忘记了我们。
Oh, shit. They forgot us.

00:07:35,855 --> 00:07:37,359
不，不，不。

我们好的游泳者。
We're good swimmers.

161
00:07:40,369 --> 00:07:42,431
你觉得那有多远?
How far do you think that is?

162
00:07:42,566 --> 00:07:44,366
一英里?
A mile?

一百英里?
A hundred miles?

164
00:07:46,575 --> 00:07:48,471
-谁能说得清?——好的。
- Who can ever really tell? - Okay.

165
00:07:48,606 --> 00:07:51,207
嗯,我们走吧。来吧。
Uh, let's go. Come on.

好的。

00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:56,914
——莉莉?——什么?
- Lily? - What?

168
00:07:57,049 --> 00:07:59,716
如果我们没能成功，我也会像亲妹妹一样爱你。
If we don't make it, I love you like a sister.

169
00:07:59,852 --> 00:08:01,415
不要说话。节省你的精力。
Don't talk. Conserve your energy.

170
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:03,618
好的。
Okay.

171
00:08:03,753 --> 00:08:05,315
你恨你姐姐。
You hate your sister.

172
00:08:05,451 --> 00:08:12,192
是的。我爱你就像一个人应该爱他的妹妹一样，如果他的妹妹不是一个十足的婊子。
Yeah. I love you like how a person is supposed to love their sister, like, if their sister wasn't a total bitch.

173
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,629

看到了吗?会没事的。
See? It's gonna be okay.

179
00:08:26,614 --> 00:08:29,275
我只看到一个超性感的船夫。
All I see is one superhot boat guy.

180
00:08:35,888 --> 00:08:37,783
你游得太远了。
You're a long way out for a swim.

181
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:40,491
船把我们给忘了。
The boat forgot us.

182
00:08:40,626 --> 00:08:42,755
他们怎么能忘了你?
How could they forget about you?

183
00:08:42,891 --> 00:08:45,159
这就是我要说的。
That's what I'm saying.

184

Got you. I got you.

你没事吧?
You okay?

是的。
Yeah.

188
00:08:56,507 --> 00:08:58,172

那么，当你不是为了活命而游泳的时候，你会做什么呢?
So, what do you do when you're not swimming for your life?

202
00:09:32,445 --> 00:09:34,371
我是一个律师。
I'm a lawyer.

203
00:09:34,507 --> 00:09:36,340
——哦。-等我回家就好了。
- Oh. - I will be when I get home.

204
00:09:36,475 --> 00:09:38,711
-我刚大学毕业。——在这里。
- I just graduated from college. - Here.

205
00:09:38,846 --> 00:09:41,087
这是令人兴奋的。
That's exciting.

206
00:09:41,222 --> 00:09:42,715
你认为呢?
You think?

207
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:44,687
不是吗?
Don't you?

208
00:09:44,822 --> 00:09:57,601
呃，我不知道。我只是…我的意思是，我的一生，我都在朝着这个遥远的目标努力，而……现在我终于到了那里，我不禁想知道我是否……
Uh, I don't know. I just... I mean, my whole life, I've been working towards this, like, far-off thing on the horizon, and... now that I've finally gotten there, I can't help but wonder if I've...

209
00:09:57,737 --> 00:10:00,201
计划一直都错了。
had the plan wrong all along.

210
00:10:02,207 --> 00:10:04,271
我不知道，但这…那太迟了。
I don't know, but it's-it's... it's too late.

211
00:10:04,406 --> 00:10:07,347
你知道，我不能不做，你知道吗?
You know, I-I can't not do it, you know?

212
00:10:07,482 --> 00:10:09,349
我不能让大家失望。
I can't let everybody down.

213
00:10:09,485 --> 00:10:11,509
你会让谁失望?
Who would you be letting down?

214
00:10:12,686 --> 00:10:16,184
比如，我父母。
Well, uh, my parents, for one.

215
00:10:17,522 --> 00:10:19,319
还有谁?
Who else?

216
00:10:20,418 --> 00:10:22,359
我想只有他们了。
Uh, well, I guess just them.

217
00:10:23,926 --> 00:10:25,297
我是说，你呢?
I mean, what about you?

218
00:10:25,432 --> 00:10:26,563
你的故事是什么?
What's your story?

219
00:10:26,698 --> 00:10:28,301
我是一名海藻农。
I'm a seaweed farmer.

220
00:10:28,436 --> 00:10:30,902
什么?
What?

221
00:10:31,037 --> 00:10:33,136
这句话我没怎么听过。
That's a sentence I haven't heard a lot.

222
00:10:33,271 --> 00:10:35,708
你和不该在一起的人在一起。
Well, you've been spending time with the wrong people.

223
00:10:35,843 --> 00:10:40,108
我父亲是一名海藻农，他的祖父也是。
Uh, my father was a seaweed farmer, his father before him.

224
00:10:40,243 --> 00:10:45,075
那他的父亲呢?
And what about his father before him?

225
00:10:45,211 --> 00:10:46,543
他是一个渔夫。
He was a fisherman.

226
00:10:46,678 --> 00:10:48,385
——嗯。-他们不可能都是赢家。
- Uh-huh. - They can't all be winners.

227
00:10:54,257 --> 00:10:56,356
你为什么那样看着我?
Why are you looking at me like that?

228
00:10:58,695 --> 00:11:00,232
我很抱歉。
I'm sorry.

229
00:11:00,368 --> 00:11:07,139
我只是,嗯……我有个疯狂的…我现在真的很想吻你。
I just, um... I have this crazy... I just really want to kiss you right now.

230
00:11:07,274 --> 00:11:10,601
但是别担心。我不会突然就…
But don't worry. I won't just, like, you know, suddenly...

You been out here for a while?

237
00:12:49,303 --> 00:12:50,877
地板不是很舒服。

241

和杜伊·达努，海洋女神。
With Dewi Danu, the goddess of the sea.

242
00:13:09,163 --> 00:13:21,539
我们所要做的就是了解她的潮汐和情绪…不向她扔塑料，不过度饲养，她会给我们美好的生活。
All we have to do is understand her tides and moods... not throw plastic into her, not over-farm her, and she'll give us wonderful lives.

243
00:13:21,675 --> 00:13:23,668
自然，上帝和人类。
Nature, god and people.

244
00:13:25,046 --> 00:13:27,606
平衡三者，你就有了和谐。
Balance the three, and you have harmony.

245
00:13:33,522 --> 00:13:36,087
我已经失去平衡了。
I am so out of balance.

246
00:13:38,516 --> 00:13:40,392
你可以在这里找到。
You can find it here.

247
00:14:00,916 --> 00:14:05,114
这是对我们社会中自由幻想的野蛮评论。
It's a savage commentary on the illusion of freedom in our society.

248
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:11,386
但仔细观察，你会发现一种基本的同情心……我想是上下颠倒了。
But look closer, and you'll divine a fundamental compassion that... I think it's upside down.

249
00:14:12,389 --> 00:14:13,894
真的?
Really?

250
00:14:16,093 --> 00:14:17,722
我能失陪一下吗?
Would you excuse me, please?

251
00:14:19,464 --> 00:14:21,800
我工作,大卫。我真的没有时间。
I'm working, David. I really don't have time.

252
00:14:21,935 --> 00:14:25,268
除非你在我们上次谈话后成为了肿瘤学家，否则你还有时间。
Unless you became an oncologist since we last spoke, you got time.

253
00:14:25,403 --> 00:14:27,532
你又来了，总是贬低我的工作。
There you go, always diminishing what I do.

254
00:14:27,668 --> 00:14:30,007
你所做的会削弱你所做的。
What you do diminishes what you do.

255
00:14:30,142 --> 00:14:31,843
-检查你的邮件。-我检查过了。
- Check your email. - I do check it.

256
00:14:31,979 --> 00:14:33,846
——你屏蔽。-莉莉给我们写信了
- You're blocked. - Lily wrote us.

257
00:14:33,982 --> 00:14:35,982
不管这是什么，都是你的错。
Whatever this is, it's your fault.

00:14:39,421 --> 00:14:40,980
她什么?
She what?

259

262
00:14:55,594 --> 00:14:58,196
——嗯。请——两个。

我只在坐飞机的时候喝酒。

00:15:18,123 --> 00:15:19,353
对不起,女士。
Excuse me, ma'am.

269
00:15:19,489 --> 00:15:20,992
我想你的东西在我的座位上。
I think your things are in my seat.

270
00:15:21,128 --> 00:15:22,923
贝丝……哦,对不起。
BETH... Oh, sorry.

271
00:15:23,058 --> 00:15:24,488
哦,来吧。
Oh, come on.

272
00:15:24,623 --> 00:15:26,026
你在跟我开玩笑吧。
You've got to be kidding me.

273
00:15:26,161 --> 00:15:27,825
你说英语。
You speak English.

274
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:30,494
你还在装意大利游客的样子吗?
Oh, you're still doing the Italian tourist bit?

275
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:32,265
对不起,女士吗?
Excuse me, ma'am?

276
00:15:32,401 --> 00:15:33,937
我得换个地方坐。
I need to sit somewhere else.

277
00:15:34,073 --> 00:15:35,773
我很抱歉。这是一个满员的航班。
I'm sorry. It's a full flight.

278
00:15:35,908 --> 00:15:36,908
我们曾经是夫妻。
We used to be married.

279
00:15:37,010 --> 00:15:38,337
我人生中最糟糕的19年。
The worst 19 years of my life.

280
00:15:38,473 --> 00:15:39,673
我们结婚才5年。
We were only married for five.

281
00:15:39,704 --> 00:15:40,942
我在计算复苏。
I'm counting the recovery.

282
00:15:41,077 --> 00:15:42,443
我不能坐在那里。
I can't sit there.

283
00:15:42,579 --> 00:15:47,414
我无能为力。嗯…我和你交换，亲爱的。
There's nothing I can do. Well... I'll swap with you, dear.

284
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:49,889
记住，万一我们下去了。哦。
Just remember, in case we go down. Oh.

285
00:15:50,024 --> 00:15:52,454
贝丝……你欠我一个人情。
BETH... Mm, you-you owe me one.

286
00:15:52,589 --> 00:15:54,397
谢谢你！-我说过我会去接她的。
Thank you. -I told you I was gonna go get her.

287
00:15:54,421 --> 00:15:59,295
再过四天……我们的女儿要嫁给一个她在千里之外刚认识的人。
In four days' time... Our daughter's gonna marry a guy she just met millions of miles from home.

288
00:15:59,430 --> 00:16:02,348
不好意思，我的话说到一半打断了你的开头吗?
Excuse me, did the middle of my sentence interrupt the beginning of yours?

289
00:16:02,431 --> 00:16:03,539
她这是在放弃自己的事业。
She's throwing her career away.

290
00:16:03,563 --> 00:16:04,961
就像她妈妈一样。
Just like her mother did.

291
00:16:05,097 --> 00:16:06,712
所以我是唯一能阻止她的人。
Which is why I'm the only one that can stop her.

292
00:16:06,736 --> 00:16:08,315
-她不听他的。-她听我的。
- She doesn't listen to him. - She listens to me.

293
00:16:08,339 --> 00:16:09,387
她回复你的邮件了吗?
Oh, did she respond to your email?

294
00:16:09,411 --> 00:16:10,609
是的。
Yes.

295
00:16:10,744 --> 00:16:12,276
她就在那儿。
And there she is.

296
00:16:14,346 --> 00:16:15,810
哦,我的上帝。保罗。
Oh, my God. Paul.

297
00:16:15,945 --> 00:16:17,247
保罗?
Paul?

298
00:16:17,383 --> 00:16:20,046
-我知道你喜欢惊喜。——哦,嗯…我知道你喜欢。
- I know you love a surprise. - Oh, uh... I know you do.

299
00:16:20,182 --> 00:16:23,623
…看来有人升级了。
Mm, mm, mm... Looks like someone upgraded.

300
00:16:23,758 --> 00:16:25,190
她讨厌惊喜。
She hates a surprise.

301
00:16:26,224 --> 00:16:28,094
大卫。你在这里做什么?
David. What are you doing here?

302
00:16:28,229 --> 00:16:30,123
我要飞往巴厘岛。你在这里做什么?
I'm flying to Bali. What are you doing here?

303
00:16:30,259 --> 00:16:31,590
我要送你去巴厘岛。
I'm flying you to Bali.

304
00:16:31,726 --> 00:16:33,999
-我不能让她一个人走。——啊。
- I couldn't let her go alone. - Ah.

305
00:16:34,134 --> 00:16:35,995
所以我和一个朋友交换了航班。
So I traded flights with a friend.

306
00:16:36,130 --> 00:16:41,334
下个月我要指挥三趟长途运输去乌拉圭，但是…你为爱所做的一切，对吧?
Got to captain three long hauls to Uruguay next month, but... the things you do for love, right?

307
00:16:41,469 --> 00:16:43,406
-太甜蜜了。——我知道。
- It's so sweet. - I know.

308
00:16:46,473 --> 00:16:48,341
-嗯-真贴心
- Mm. - So sweet.

309
00:16:51,075 --> 00:16:53,118
啊。啊,是的。我也是。
Ah. Ah, oui. Me, too.

310
00:16:53,254 --> 00:16:57,347
乔治亚-嗯，嗯，嗯，嗯，嗯，嗯，嗯。
GEORGIA and-Mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm.

311
00:17:02,493 --> 00:17:04,162
哦,我的。人的眼睛。
Oh, my. Those eyes.

312
00:17:04,297 --> 00:17:05,856
嗯。你就不能穿着它游泳吗?
Hmm. Couldn't you just swim in them?

313
00:17:05,991 --> 00:17:08,100
它们是蓝色的。大不了的。我的袜子也是。
They're blue. Big deal. So are my socks.

314
00:17:08,235 --> 00:17:10,764
法国人是很好的情人。
And Frenchmen make such great lovers.

315
00:17:10,899 --> 00:17:12,864
那是他们自己造的谣言。
That's a rumor they started about themselves.

316
00:17:12,999 --> 00:17:14,297
继续告诉你自己吧。
Oh, keep telling yourself that.

317
00:17:14,432 --> 00:17:15,432
哈哈。
Ha-ha.

318
00:17:15,501 --> 00:17:17,136
哦!香槟。
Oh! Champagne.

319
00:17:17,271 --> 00:17:18,601
哦。请给我两个。
Oh. Two, please.

320
00:17:18,736 --> 00:17:19,974
把瓶子留下。
Just leave the bottle.

321
00:17:20,109 --> 00:17:21,444
谢谢你！
Thank you.

322
00:17:23,614 --> 00:17:27,127
宝贝，我不觉得他跟着你一起去会有什么帮助。
Baby, I don't think that him tagging along on your trip is going to help.

323
00:17:27,151 --> 00:17:28,616
好吧，这是一个性感的想法。
Well, that's a hot take.

324
00:17:28,751 --> 00:17:31,818
大卫上次帮忙是我们造莉莉的那晚。
The last time David was actually helpful was the night we made Lily.

325
00:17:31,953 --> 00:17:34,660
有一幅画我不太喜欢。
There's an image I'm not crazy about.

326
00:17:34,796 --> 00:17:36,562
活到老学到老。
Mm. You live, you learn.

327
00:17:36,697 --> 00:17:38,098
你升级。
You upgrade.

328
00:17:40,027 --> 00:17:42,696
不是你在开飞机吗，保罗?
Aren't you supposed to be flying the plane, Paul?

329
00:17:42,831 --> 00:17:44,637
至少不跟乘客亲热?
At least not making out with the passengers?

330
00:17:44,773 --> 00:17:46,172
就在乘客。
Just this passenger.

331
00:17:46,307 --> 00:17:48,205
唯一算数的。
The only one that counts. Mm.

332
00:17:48,341 --> 00:17:53,312
这对你来说完全是陌生的概念，但保罗把我放在第一位。他支持我所做的一切。
It's a totally foreign concept to you, but Paul puts me first. He supports everything I do.

333
00:17:53,447 --> 00:17:55,187
那是因为她做的每件事都是完美的。
That's because everything she does is perfect.

334
00:17:55,211 --> 00:17:56,582
他是夸大。
He's exaggerating.

335
00:17:56,717 --> 00:17:58,177
是吗?是吗?
Is he? Are you?

336
00:17:58,312 --> 00:17:59,479
我真的不是。
I'm really not.

337
00:17:59,614 --> 00:18:01,077
-你当然是。-如果你这么说的话。
- Sure, you are. - If you say so.

338
00:18:03,158 --> 00:18:05,754
好吧，只是有点乱流。
Okay, it's just a little turbulence.

339
00:18:05,889 --> 00:18:10,658
这架飞机实际上是为了在……请回到您的座位上。
The plane is actually designed to right itself in... Please go back to your seats.

340
00:18:15,195 --> 00:18:17,533
哦，这是我的房子，我的花园。
Oh, it's my house, my garden.

341
00:18:17,668 --> 00:18:19,172
我的房子。
My house.

342
00:18:19,307 --> 00:18:21,172
为什么我有这么多房子的照片?
Why do I have so many pictures of my house?

343
00:18:21,308 --> 00:18:23,275
哦,有查理。他是我的狗。
Oh, there's Charlie. He's my dog.

344
00:18:23,410 --> 00:18:26,102
我说过他很老，身体不好吗?
Did I mention he's very old and unwell?

345
00:18:26,237 --> 00:18:27,620
贝丝·安，会没事的，真的。
Beth-Ann, it's gonna be all right, really.

346
00:18:27,644 --> 00:18:29,044
你是对的。一切都会好的。
You're right. It's going to be fine.

347
00:18:36,315 --> 00:18:38,922
当然，你知道，这种事是难免的。
These things happen, of course, you know.

348
00:18:39,058 --> 00:18:40,357
飞行员不是魔术师。
Pilots aren't magicians.

349
00:18:40,493 --> 00:18:41,864
我们在上面的控制力有限。
We-we only have so much control up there.

350
00:18:41,888 --> 00:18:43,587
哦,当然。人明白。
Oh, of course. People understand that.

351
00:18:43,723 --> 00:18:45,095
你他妈太差劲了!
You're the fucking worst!

352
00:18:45,231 --> 00:18:48,062
想杀我们还不错，混蛋!
Nice try killing us, asshole!

353
00:18:49,065 --> 00:18:51,206
也许你该走了，趁他们还没动手。
Maybe you should go, before they get out the pitchforks.

354
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:53,211
你回来的时候我再找你，好吗?-是的。
I'll see you when you get back here, okay? -Yeah.

355
00:18:53,235 --> 00:18:54,469
好的。
Okay.

356
00:18:54,605 --> 00:18:56,671
-四天后见。——是的。
- I'll see you in four days. - Yes.

357
00:19:01,741 --> 00:19:03,244
别怪你自己了，保罗。
Don't blame yourself, Paul.

358
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:06,081
这可能发生在任何不知道自己在做什么的人身上。
It could happen to anybody who doesn't know what they're doing.

359
00:19:06,183 --> 00:19:07,447
莉莉在哪里?
Where's Lily?

360
00:19:07,582 --> 00:19:09,251
我以为你收到她的邮件了。
I thought you got her email.

361
00:19:09,387 --> 00:19:11,414
她会下船来接我们。
She's meeting us off the boat.

362
00:19:11,549 --> 00:19:13,120
什么?
What?

363
00:19:29,038 --> 00:19:31,308
这是我见过的最不可思议的地方。
This is the most incredible place I've ever seen.

364
00:19:31,443 --> 00:19:32,945
你知道什么是不可思议的吗?
You know what's incredible?

365
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:34,771
夏威夷，它在美国。
Hawaii, and it's in America.

366
00:19:34,906 --> 00:19:36,279
你从没去过夏威夷。
You've never been to Hawaii.

367
00:19:36,414 --> 00:19:37,654
你不知道我去过哪里。
You don't know where I've been.

368
00:19:37,747 --> 00:19:39,479
-你从没去过夏威夷。——啊。
- You've never been to Hawaii. - Ah.

369
00:19:39,614 --> 00:19:41,483
好的。我们来谈谈计划。
Okay. Let's talk game plan.

370
00:19:41,618 --> 00:19:45,123
虽然这会让我们都很痛苦，但我们必须休战才能继续下去。
As much as this will pain us both, we have to call a truce to make this work.

371
00:19:45,258 --> 00:19:46,466
是的，我们必须步调一致。
Yes, we have to be in lockstep.

372
00:19:46,490 --> 00:19:47,819
——不吝啬。——没有争论。
- No meanness. - No arguing.

373
00:19:47,954 --> 00:19:49,592
-我们作为一个整体说话。- - - - - -完全正确。
- We speak as one. - Exactly right.

374
00:19:49,728 --> 00:19:52,056
我们什么时候开始?-等我们见到莉莉之后
- When do we start? - Right after we see Lily.

375
00:19:54,064 --> 00:19:57,633
我们告诉她婚礼取消了，然后带她回家。
We tell her the wedding is off, and we'll bring her home.

376
00:19:57,768 --> 00:19:59,328
当我们说"不"的时候
Well, you know whenever we say "don't"

377
00:19:59,404 --> 00:20:00,932
对莉莉来说，她只听到了“做”。
to Lily, she just hears "do."

378
00:20:01,068 --> 00:20:10,612
我建议我们百分百地支持她，支持她，爱她，这样才能骗她甩了西维德先生。
I say we go in 100% there for her in all ways, just supportive and loving, and that's how we trick her into dumping Mr. Seaweed.

379
00:20:10,748 --> 00:20:13,452
这很有趣。现在，我在想特洛伊木马之类的东西。
That's interesting. Now, I'm thinking about a Trojan horse sort of thing.

380
00:20:13,587 --> 00:20:18,190
我们让她觉得我们对婚礼没意见，等我们进去了，让她自己结束婚礼。
We make her think we're okay with the wedding, and then once we're in, we get her to end it herself.

381
00:20:18,326 --> 00:20:19,987
这就是我刚才说的。
That's literally what I just said.

382
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:23,120
我不记得任何特洛伊木马的事。
I don't remember anything about a Trojan horse.

383
00:20:31,162 --> 00:20:32,700
好了，你有计划了吗?
Okay, so you got the plan?

384
00:20:32,836 --> 00:20:34,740
我当然有这个计划。这是我的计划。
Of course I got the plan. It's my plan.

385
00:20:34,875 --> 00:20:36,375
谢谢,伙计们。
Thanks, fellas.

386
00:20:37,377 --> 00:20:39,868
嘿。
Hey.

387
00:20:40,004 --> 00:20:41,375
——哦!嘿,家伙。-嗨。
- Oh! Hey, guys. - Hey.

388
00:20:41,511 --> 00:20:43,674
-嗨。你好。——嗨,爸爸。
- Hey. Hi. - Hey, Dad.

389
00:20:43,810 --> 00:20:46,349
-嗨。嘿,你好。-嗨。
- Hi. Hey and hi. - Hi.

390
00:20:46,484 --> 00:20:50,347
你们有约定在先杀了我之前不杀对方吗?
So, did you make a pact to not murder each other until you murder me first?

391
00:20:50,382 --> 00:20:52,720
哦,来吧。没有人在谋杀任何人。-不,没有。
Oh, come on. Nobody is murdering anybody. -No, no.

392
00:20:52,856 --> 00:20:54,717
我是说，当然，我们有一些问题。
I mean, of course, we have some questions.

393
00:20:54,853 --> 00:20:56,259
我们是你的父母。
We are your parents.

394
00:20:56,395 --> 00:20:57,823
我们都在你身边，亲爱的。
We are here for you, my love.

395
00:20:57,959 --> 00:20:59,479
-是的，我们步调一致。——是的。正确的。
- Yes, we're in lockstep. - Yes. Right.

396
00:20:59,566 --> 00:21:02,976
好吧，因为我真的被你们要说的话吓坏了…特别是您,爸爸。
Okay, 'cause I've been really freaked out about what you guys were gonna say... Especially you, Dad.

397
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,381
我打耳洞的时候你惊恐发作了。
I mean, you had a panic attack when I pierced my ears.

398
00:21:04,405 --> 00:21:06,199
——是的。-这只是卫生问题。
- Yes. - Well, it's just about hygiene.

399
00:21:06,334 --> 00:21:11,940

And I know how much you wanted the lawyer thing. It just... - Well... - Uh, we-we just... we want you - to be happy, honey. - Yeah.

哇。好的。
Wow. Okay.

401
00:21:15,681 --> 00:21:18,683
-真是松了一口气。——好的。
- That is such a relief. - All right.

402
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:19,943
哇。
Wow.

403
00:21:20,078 --> 00:21:21,418
-噢，兰尼，嗨。——嘿,鹪鹩。
- Oh, Wrenny, hi. - Hey, Wren.

404
00:21:21,554 --> 00:21:23,713
我不介意。只是来支援的。
Don't mind me. Just here for backup.

405
00:21:23,849 --> 00:21:24,849
我们现在都没事了。
We're all good now.

406
00:21:24,917 --> 00:21:27,787
你们会喜欢这里的-你们也会喜欢格德的。——爱他。
You guys are gonna love it here, - and you'll love Gede. - Love him.

407
00:21:27,923 --> 00:21:29,294
埃?真是个好名字。
Gede? That's a nice name.

408
00:21:29,430 --> 00:21:31,089
——真的很不错。-好了，别说了。
- Really nice. - Okay, please stop.

409
00:21:31,225 --> 00:21:33,597
等不及要听海藻养殖的故事了。
Can't wait to hear all about seaweed farming.

410
00:21:35,030 --> 00:21:37,568
你们确定没问题吗?
Are you guys sure you're good with this?

411
00:21:38,868 --> 00:21:41,133
因为你可以直接告诉我。
'Cause you know you could just tell me.

412
00:21:41,268 --> 00:21:44,104
你没必要搞什么特洛伊木马。
You don't have to do a whole Trojan horse thing.

413
00:21:44,239 --> 00:21:47,047
关注度高…为什么……什么是…-你…——什么?
Wh-What... Why do... What-what's... - What-what-what do you... - A what?

414
00:21:47,071 --> 00:21:48,214
——那是什么?——嗯?
- What's that? - Hmm?

415
00:21:48,349 --> 00:21:50,143
你不是跟我说过这个故事吗，妈妈?
Didn't you tell me that story, Mom?

416
00:21:50,279 --> 00:21:52,057
不，我告诉过你。何珥木马……我跟你说过那个故事。
No, I told you. The Trojan hor... I told you that story.

417
00:21:52,081 --> 00:21:54,715
——Oy。没关系。-那是我。我做了……没关系。
- Oy. It doesn't matter. - That was me. I-I did... Doesn't matter.

418
00:21:54,783 --> 00:21:56,822
我们都在你身边。
We just are both here for you.

419
00:21:56,957 --> 00:21:58,721
是的。因循守旧。
Yeah. Lockstep.

420
00:22:20,037 --> 00:22:23,506
我不明白我们为什么不能直接去酒店。
I don't see why we couldn't have gone straight to the hotel.

421
00:22:23,641 --> 00:22:26,352
是啊，你几小时前就该来了。
Yeah, well, you were supposed to be here hours ago.

422
00:22:26,487 --> 00:22:28,454
-这不是他的错。——飞行员的错误。
- It wasn't his fault. - Pilot error.

423
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:33,849
订婚派对现在开始了，所以…谁会去?
The engagement party kind of starts now, so... Who's gonna be there?

424
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:35,395
亲密的家庭。
Just close family.

425
00:22:38,558 --> 00:22:39,964
好的。
Okay.

426
00:22:40,099 --> 00:22:41,526
该去散步了。
Time for a walk.

427
00:22:41,661 --> 00:22:43,761
等等,什么?
Wait, what?

428
00:22:43,897 --> 00:22:45,295
我们回到了巅峰。
We get back on at the top.

429
00:22:45,431 --> 00:22:47,265
跟这么多人在一起实在是不行。
It just can't make it with all these people.

430
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,265
难以置信。我要拿回我的4000。
Unbelievable. I want my 4,000 whatevers back.

431
00:22:49,401 --> 00:22:52,137
你知道这相当于四分之一，对吧?
You know that's like a quarter, right?

432
00:22:56,513 --> 00:22:59,310
妈妈，爸爸，这是格德。
Mom, Dad, this is Gede.

433
00:22:59,445 --> 00:23:02,186
Om swasti astu，爸爸。Om swasti astu，我。

Om swasti astu, Gede。
Om swasti astu, Gede.

435
00:23:03,990 --> 00:23:05,357
嘿。
Hey.

436
00:23:05,493 --> 00:23:07,159
你学这个是为了让我难堪。
You learned that to make me look bad.

437
00:23:07,295 --> 00:23:08,954
你不需要我的帮助。
You don't need my help there.

438
00:23:09,090 --> 00:23:12,896
柯顿先生、柯顿夫人，欢迎你们到我的国家来，很快也会到我家来。
Uh, Mr. and Mrs. Cotton, I welcome you to my country and soon to my home.

439
00:23:13,032 --> 00:23:15,496
科顿夫人是他的母亲。你可以叫我乔治亚。
Mrs. Cotton is his mother. You can just call me Georgia.

440
00:23:15,632 --> 00:23:17,866
哦。如你所愿，乔治亚。
Oh. As you wish, Georgia.

441
00:23:20,198 --> 00:23:23,075
是的，我和科顿先生相处得很好。
Yeah, I'm good with Mr. Cotton.

442
00:23:23,211 --> 00:23:24,508
啊。嗨,伙计们。
Ah. Hi, guys.

443
00:23:24,644 --> 00:23:26,045
雷恩走了。
Well, there goes Wren.

444
00:23:26,181 --> 00:23:27,909
再见,各位。
Bye, guys.

445
00:23:28,044 --> 00:23:30,140
乔治娅，我能载你一程吗?
Uh, Georgia, perhaps I can give you a lift?

446
00:23:30,275 --> 00:23:31,544
啊，我们开始吧。是的。
Ah, let's do it. Yeah.

447
00:23:35,049 --> 00:23:37,281
再见。看到你在那里。
Bye. See you there.

448
00:23:38,292 --> 00:23:40,983
他难道不神奇吗?
Isn't he amazing?

449
00:23:41,118 --> 00:23:42,822
除非他放下她。
Only if he drops her.

450
00:23:42,957 --> 00:23:44,523
——爸爸。- - - - - -来吧。我们走吧。
- Dad. - Come on. Let's go.

451
00:23:50,634 --> 00:23:52,229
这只是亲密的家庭?
This is just close family?

452
00:23:52,364 --> 00:23:56,540
不可思议的是…它们其实都很接近。
And the incredible thing is... is that they're all actually close.

453
00:23:56,675 --> 00:24:03,713
好的。记住，进屋脱鞋，用右手吃饭，永远不要碰别人的头。
Okay. Remember, shoes off inside, eat with your right hand, and never, ever touch anyone's head.

454
00:24:03,848 --> 00:24:06,549
我为什么要摸别人的头?
Why would I want to touch anyone's head?

455
00:24:06,684 --> 00:24:07,951
嘿,家伙。C先生。
Hey, guys. Mr. C.

456
00:24:08,087 --> 00:24:09,087
嗯?
Hmm?

457
00:24:09,188 --> 00:24:13,553
这是科曼，这些是他的纹身。
This is Komang, and these are his tattoos.

458
00:24:13,688 --> 00:24:14,851
很高兴认识你。
Nice to meet you.

459
00:24:14,987 --> 00:24:17,732
他不知道，但我们明天要一起吃早餐。
He doesn't know it, but we're gonna be having breakfast tomorrow.

460
00:24:17,756 --> 00:24:19,026
嘿。
Hey.

461
00:24:20,994 --> 00:24:22,801
她也来吃早餐吗?
Is she coming to breakfast, too?

462
00:24:25,265 --> 00:24:26,768
我需要一个这样的。
I need to get one of those.

463
00:24:29,042 --> 00:24:30,870
Putri。
Putri.

464
00:24:31,006 --> 00:24:32,974
-嗨。-他叫你什么?
- Hey. - What did he call you?

465
00:24:33,109 --> 00:24:35,777
它的意思是“女儿”。
It means "daughter."

466
00:24:35,913 --> 00:24:36,982
你是我的女儿。
You're my daughter.

467
00:24:37,117 --> 00:24:38,375
我的女儿。
My daughter.

468
00:24:40,354 --> 00:24:41,550
哦。
Oh.

469
00:24:41,685 --> 00:24:43,048
从现在开始，我们共享她。
From here on, we will share her.

470
00:24:43,183 --> 00:24:47,721
我们会永远在一起…-是的。-在牢不可破的家庭纽带中。
We'll be united for all of time... - Yeah. - In the unbreakable bond of family.

471
00:24:47,857 --> 00:24:48,984
——这是我们。——好的。是的。
- It's us. - Okay. Yeah.

472
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,219
你可以随时放手。
You can let go anytime.

473
00:24:50,354 --> 00:24:52,394
——好。-是的。
- Good. - Yeah.

474
00:24:52,530 --> 00:24:53,823
把你的刀给我。
Now give me your knife.

475
00:24:53,958 --> 00:24:55,760
我的…我的刀吗?
My... my knife?

476
00:24:55,896 --> 00:24:57,333
把你的刀给我。
Give me your knife.

477
00:24:57,469 --> 00:24:59,136
我没带刀。
I didn't bring a knife.

478
00:24:59,271 --> 00:25:00,569
没有刀?
No knife?

479
00:25:00,705 --> 00:25:01,767
我没带刀。
I didn't bring a knife.

480
00:25:01,902 --> 00:25:03,107
——没有刀吗?——不,不。
- No knife? - No, no.

481
00:25:03,243 --> 00:25:04,671
好的。
Okay.

482
00:25:04,807 --> 00:25:06,275
——没有问题。——哇。
- No problem. - Wow.

483
00:25:08,210 --> 00:25:18,747
巴厘岛的习俗是，在见面时，两位父亲必须深深地割进自己的前臂，并互相涂抹对方的鲜血。
It is a Balinese custom that upon meeting, the two fathers must cut deeply into their forearms and each smear the other blood.

484
00:25:20,427 --> 00:25:22,193
你真该看看你的脸。
You should really see your face.

485
00:25:28,501 --> 00:25:29,993
嘿,家伙。
Hey, guys.

486
00:25:30,129 --> 00:25:31,467
-给我一些。-嗨。
- Give me some. - Hi.

487
00:25:31,602 --> 00:25:33,303
是的。嗷，嗷，嗷，嗷!
Yeah. Ow, ow, ow, ow!

488
00:25:36,810 --> 00:25:40,372
令人惊奇的是，有这么一个大家庭，总有值得庆祝的事情。
What's amazing is, with such a big family, there's always something to celebrate.

489
00:25:40,507 --> 00:25:42,672
但如果没有，他们就会庆祝这是一个大家庭。
But if not, they just celebrate that it's a big family.

490
00:25:42,808 --> 00:25:46,221
好吧，我得庆祝我知道了一些名字，因为要记住的人太多了。
All right, well, I need to celebrate learning some names, because there's just too many people to remember.

491
00:25:46,245 --> 00:25:47,953
是的。我做了一个电子表格。
Yeah. I did make a spreadsheet.

492
00:25:48,088 --> 00:25:50,380
大部分我都没拿到。我通常只是经常微笑。
I haven't gotten most of them. I usually just smile a lot.

493
00:25:50,516 --> 00:25:52,720
哦，你在厨房。这是新的。
Oh, you're in the kitchen. That's new.

494
00:25:52,856 --> 00:25:55,058
莉莉。Meme。

495
00:25:55,194 --> 00:25:56,352
哦!
Oh!

496
00:25:56,488 --> 00:25:59,456
妈妈，爸爸，这是Gede的妈妈Suli，还有他的妹妹Losi。——哦。
Mom, Dad, this is Gede's mother Suli - and his sister Losi. - Oh.

497
00:25:59,592 --> 00:26:01,192
洛西接受的医生培训…
Losi's training to be a doctor... Mm.

498
00:26:01,328 --> 00:26:03,529
太棒了。你好。很高兴认识你。
Fantastic. Hi. Nice to meet you.

499
00:26:03,664 --> 00:26:04,862
是的。

500
00:26:25,623 --> 00:26:27,660
她说,“欢迎。”
She says, "Welcome."

501
00:26:28,656 --> 00:26:29,691
哦。
Oh.

00:26:31,358 --> 00:26:34,423
孩子们早上上学前在这里踢足球。

503
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:35,897
欢迎你加入。
You'd be welcome to join in.

504
00:26:36,033 --> 00:26:38,568
不是我的游戏。我不会指望的。
Not my game. I wouldn't count on it.

505
00:26:38,703 --> 00:26:40,406
你是怎么养殖海藻的?
How do you farm the seaweed?

506
00:26:40,541 --> 00:26:42,070
——啊。我们用网。
- Ah. Uh, we use nets. - Mm.

507
00:26:42,206 --> 00:26:46,944
幼苗被绑在单丝线上，五周后，我们把它们带进来。
Uh, seedlings are tied to monofilament lines, then five weeks later, we bring them in.

508
00:26:47,079 --> 00:26:49,544
一个分配器会把它冻结，然后运出去。
A distributor flash-freezes it and ships it out.

509
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:51,416
运到哪里?
Ships it to where?

510
00:26:51,551 --> 00:26:53,075
过去主要是日本。
It used to be mainly Japan.

511
00:26:53,211 --> 00:26:55,248
现在全世界都是这样。
Now all over the world.

512
00:26:55,384 --> 00:26:59,549
我们刚和全食超市签了协议，所以我们就在你家附近。
Uh, we just signed a deal with Whole Foods, so we're around your street corner.

513
00:27:01,318 --> 00:27:03,091
嗯。
Hmm.

514
00:27:10,098 --> 00:27:11,803
他说你很漂亮。
He says you are very beautiful.

515
00:27:11,938 --> 00:27:14,569
哦。帮我向他说声谢谢。
Oh. Well, um, tell him I said thank you.

516
00:27:18,203 --> 00:27:22,871
现在他说你让他想起了一匹漂亮的马。
And now he is saying you remind him of a very attractive horse.

517
00:27:23,007 --> 00:27:24,748
哦。
Oh.

518
00:27:24,883 --> 00:27:26,911
——真的吗?-这不可能。
- Really? - That can't be right.

519
00:27:33,857 --> 00:27:35,491
不,他……他说的是马。
No, he... he did mean horse.

520
00:27:35,627 --> 00:27:37,122
哦。
Oh.

521
00:27:37,258 --> 00:27:39,162
嗯。
Hmm.

522
00:27:39,298 --> 00:27:40,590
哦。
Oh.

523
00:27:42,030 --> 00:27:43,494
——棉花先生吗?——嗯?
- Mr. Cotton? - Hmm?

524
00:27:43,630 --> 00:27:45,765
我必须告诉你，我非常爱你的女儿。
I must tell you, I love your daughter very much.

525
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:48,005
我不怪你。
I don't blame you.

526
00:27:48,141 --> 00:27:52,842
我很欣赏这一切发生得如此之快，你和乔治娅必须对此警觉起来。
And I appreciate that it's happening really fast, and you and Georgia must be alarmed by that.

527
00:27:52,977 --> 00:27:56,071
你们俩看起来很般配。
Well, you two seem good together.

528
00:27:56,206 --> 00:27:57,915
莉莉喜欢巴厘岛。
Lily loves Bali.

529
00:27:58,050 --> 00:28:01,083
我能想象她在这里会开心一阵子。
I can see her being happy here for a while.

530
00:28:02,487 --> 00:28:04,346
一会儿吗?
For a while?

531
00:28:04,481 --> 00:28:06,055
没有什么是永恒的。
Well, nothing lasts forever.

532
00:28:07,054 --> 00:28:08,785
婚姻应该如此。
Marriage is supposed to.

533
00:28:08,921 --> 00:28:14,793
我也是这么想的直到我坐在乔治亚对面和一群律师一起分我们的东西。
That's what I thought till I was sitting across from Georgia with a bunch of lawyers dividing up our stuff.

534
00:28:14,928 --> 00:28:17,759
所以,享受这个。
So, enjoy this.

535
00:28:17,895 --> 00:28:25,435
直到莉莉结束这段感情，她一定会的因为她野心勃勃，好奇心无穷无尽。
Right up until the minute that Lily ends it, which she will because she's ambitious and she's endlessly curious.

536
00:28:25,570 --> 00:28:33,412
虽然这个岛很美，你看起来也很可爱，但最终，光靠这些是不够的。
And as beautiful as this island is, and as pleasant as you seem to be, ultimately, it's just not gonna be enough.

537
00:28:35,183 --> 00:28:37,483
一点建议:不要生孩子。
Bit of advice: Don't have kids.

538
00:28:37,619 --> 00:28:41,959
当她吃了这些药回到美国的时候情况就更复杂了。
Makes it much more complicated when she takes them and she goes back to the States.

539
00:28:44,630 --> 00:28:47,160
我饿了。你饿了吗?
I'm hungry. You hungry?

540
00:28:47,295 --> 00:28:48,667
是啊，我们去吃点东西吧。
Yeah, let's get something to eat.

541
00:28:48,803 --> 00:28:50,836
我们去吃点东西吧。
Let's get some food.

542
00:29:04,875 --> 00:29:10,018
今天，为了向我们尊贵的客人表示敬意，我用英语和你们讲话。
Today, in honor of our guests of distinction, I speak to you English.

543
00:29:10,154 --> 00:29:13,721
我很确定你吃完整头猪不会得到任何奖励。
I'm pretty sure you don't win anything for finishing the whole pig.

544
00:29:13,857 --> 00:29:16,057
保罗真是个幸运的家伙。
Paul's such a lucky guy.

545
00:29:16,192 --> 00:29:18,258
所有的审判都是他自己的。
All that judgment all to himself.

546
00:29:18,394 --> 00:29:23,934
苏丽和我用爱与和平欢迎所有的朋友和家人来到我们家。
Suli and I welcome with love and peace all friends and family into our home.

547
00:29:24,070 --> 00:29:28,871
不久也将成为格德和莉莉的家。
Soon also to be the home of Gede and Lily.

548
00:29:29,006 --> 00:29:32,535
——或者不是。-我们是多么的骄傲…Gede正在重新考虑。
- Or not. - And how proud we are... Gede is having second thoughts.

549
00:29:32,671 --> 00:29:34,107
我看到你们两个了。发生了什么事?
I saw the two of you. What happened?

550
00:29:34,243 --> 00:29:36,741
我启动了第二阶段。
I initiated phase two.

551
00:29:36,876 --> 00:29:39,243
我们摆脱了特洛伊木马。我们开始杀人。
We get out of the Trojan horse. We start killing people.

552
00:29:39,379 --> 00:29:41,720
我们离第二阶段还远着呢。
We are nowhere near phase two.

553
00:29:41,855 --> 00:29:47,024
也许你在另一个派对上，但在我看来，我们将会继承150个新姻亲。
Maybe you're at a different party, but from where I'm sitting, we're about to inherit 150 new in-laws.

554
00:29:47,159 --> 00:29:49,224
哦,上帝。你总是用自己的方式看问题。
Oh, God. You only ever see things your own way.

555
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:51,139
每个人都只以自己的方式看待事物。
Everybody only ever sees anything their own way.

556
00:29:51,163 --> 00:29:52,860
这就解释了你为什么离开我和莉莉。
Explains why you walked out on me and Lily.

557
00:29:52,996 --> 00:29:54,400
我没有抛弃莉莉
I didn't walk out on Lily.

558
00:29:54,535 --> 00:29:57,760
Desa,卡拉,智利。
Desa, kala, patra.

559
00:29:57,895 --> 00:30:02,134
对于婚姻来说，它必须是正确的地方。
For marriage, it must to be right place.

560
00:30:02,270 --> 00:30:05,073
它必须是正确的时间。
It must to be the right time.

561
00:30:05,209 --> 00:30:07,374
它必须是正确的环境。
It must to be the right circumstance.

562
00:30:07,509 --> 00:30:08,921
我希望有人能给我们解释一下。
I wish someone had have explained that to us.

563
00:30:08,945 --> 00:30:11,109
我们三分之一。
We were oh for three.

564
00:30:11,245 --> 00:30:12,647
-三个一个。——嗯?
- One for three. - Hmm?

565
00:30:12,783 --> 00:30:14,279
三。
One for three.

566
00:30:14,414 --> 00:30:16,288
错误的环境，错误的时间。
Wrong circumstance, wrong time.

567
00:30:16,423 --> 00:30:18,455
正确的地方。
Right place.

568
00:30:18,590 --> 00:30:20,451
在湖边。
By the lake.

569
00:30:20,587 --> 00:30:30,133
所以我宣布，按照艾达·阿纳克·林格尔的建议，格德将在四天后与莉莉结婚。
So I announce that Gede will marry Lily in four days' time, as suggested by Ida Anak Lingsir.

570
00:30:32,203 --> 00:30:34,769
我孩子的母亲，你同意吗?
Mother of my children, do you agree?

571
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:45,812
她祝福你，从今以后永远。
She gives her blessing, for now and for always.

572
00:30:45,947 --> 00:30:47,618
大卫?
And, David?

573
00:30:47,753 --> 00:30:49,548
格鲁吉亚?你同意吗?
Georgia? Do you agree?

574
00:30:50,823 --> 00:30:54,086
是的，我们祝福你。
Um, y-yes, we give our blessing.

575
00:30:54,222 --> 00:30:55,958
——是的。-是的，暂时是的。
- Yep. - Y-Yes, for now.

576
00:30:56,093 --> 00:30:57,355
——永远。——永远。
- And always. - And always.

577
00:30:57,490 --> 00:30:58,660
太好了,太好了。正确的。
Great, great. Right.

578
00:30:58,795 --> 00:31:00,592
这很好。
That's good.

579
00:31:05,003 --> 00:31:07,640
莉莉:很好。
LILY That went great.

580
00:31:07,775 --> 00:31:09,598
就好了。
Just great.

581
00:31:09,733 --> 00:31:11,369
绝对,它叫的。
Absolutely, it did.

582
00:31:11,504 --> 00:31:13,407
不能再好了。
Could not have gone any better.

583
00:31:16,448 --> 00:31:18,642
你和我爸在海边聊什么呢?
What were you and my dad talking about by the beach?

584
00:31:18,778 --> 00:31:21,580
海藻,主要是。他有很多问题。
Seaweed, mostly. He had a lot of questions.

585
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:25,819
他爱你。
He loves you.

586
00:31:25,955 --> 00:31:27,986
他爱你。
He loves you.

587
00:31:28,122 --> 00:31:30,391
他们都做。
They both do.

588
00:31:30,527 --> 00:31:33,698
我是他们唯一能达成一致的人。
Well, I'm the only thing they can ever agree on.

589
00:31:33,833 --> 00:31:36,291
真的吗?
Really?

590
00:31:36,427 --> 00:31:38,003
很高兴知道。
Good to know.

591
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:43,067
欢迎来到瓦鲁纳酒店。
Welcome to the Hotel Waruna.

592
00:31:43,202 --> 00:31:47,375
看到你们的笑脸真是太高兴了。
It is a very great pleasure to see your smiling faces.

593
00:31:48,539 --> 00:31:51,406
先生，您住221房间。
You, sir, are in 221.

594
00:31:51,541 --> 00:31:52,851
很好的房间。
Really good room.

595
00:31:52,987 --> 00:31:55,178
确保我离她很远。
Make sure I'm a long way from her.

596
00:31:55,313 --> 00:31:56,879
而你,夫人?
And you, madam?

597
00:31:57,889 --> 00:31:59,889
请走很远的路。
A very long way, please.

598
00:32:00,024 --> 00:32:03,457
222. 几乎一样好。
222. Almost just as really good.

599
00:32:05,633 --> 00:32:07,394
你还打鼾吗?
Do you still snore?

600
00:32:07,529 --> 00:32:10,893
你认识年纪越大打鼾越少的人吗?
Do you know anybody that snores less when they get older?

601
00:32:11,028 --> 00:32:15,304
我整晚都在听你说话，我会在更好的房间里说。
I'm gonna be listening to you all night, I'm gonna do it from the better room.

602
00:32:16,538 --> 00:32:18,602
你知道你以前练过空手道吗?
You know you used to do sleep karate?

603
00:32:18,738 --> 00:32:22,172
你会在床上跳来跳去，就像在攻击它。
You'd fling yourself around the bed - like you were attacking it. - Mm.

604
00:32:22,307 --> 00:32:23,772
我没有睡着。
I wasn't asleep.

605
00:32:23,908 --> 00:32:26,414
-我是在攻击你-给你。
- I was attacking you. - There you go.

606
00:32:27,888 --> 00:32:29,181
试着把鼾声关小一点。
Try to keep the snoring down.

607
00:32:29,316 --> 00:32:30,781
我有鼻贴。
I have a nasal strip.

608
00:32:30,916 --> 00:32:33,520
你还是一个人，这是个谜。
It's a mystery you're still alone.

609
00:33:02,747 --> 00:33:04,648
能再给我来一杯吗?
Can I get another one of these?

610
00:33:04,784 --> 00:33:07,389
他点什么，我就来两杯。
I'll have two of whatever he's having.

611
00:33:08,590 --> 00:33:10,720
你好,鹪鹩。你在这里做什么?
Hello, Wren. What are you doing here?

612
00:33:10,856 --> 00:33:14,757
不像你女儿，我从来不是那种"泥地茅屋"的女孩。
Unlike your daughter, I've never been a "thatched hut with a dirt floor" kind of gal.

613
00:33:14,893 --> 00:33:18,961
-我这里有个布置得很好的扫帚间-干得好。
- Mm. - I've got a nicely appointed - broom closet here. - Good for you.

614
00:33:20,802 --> 00:33:23,401
你知道吗，整出这破事都怪你。
You know, I blame you for this whole shit show.

615
00:33:23,536 --> 00:33:25,411
你是这么想的?
That's what you think of it?

616
00:33:25,546 --> 00:33:26,841
你不?
You don't?

617
00:33:26,977 --> 00:33:28,837
莉莉的快乐。
Lily's happy.

618
00:33:28,973 --> 00:33:34,345
四年来，我一直看着她在大学里自虐，我很乐意看到这一幕。
And after four years of watching her beat herself up at college, I love to see that.

619
00:33:34,481 --> 00:33:35,984
我想你也会的。
I thought you might, too.

620
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:38,022
嘿，听着，开心很好。
Hey, look, happy is great.

621
00:33:38,158 --> 00:33:40,350
莉莉的快乐是最伟大的。
Lily happy is the greatest of all.

622
00:33:40,485 --> 00:33:45,521
只是……当你为人父母时，会发生一件奇怪的事情。
It's just that... a weird thing happens when you become a parent.

623
00:33:45,656 --> 00:33:50,697
当你的孩子情绪低落，他们痛苦不堪时，你会死的。
When your kid is down, when they're in pain, it kills you.

624
00:33:50,832 --> 00:33:56,668
但当它们升起，当事情进展顺利时，你才会真正害怕。
But when they're up, when things are going great, that's when you get really scared.

625
00:33:56,803 --> 00:34:01,436
因为你不希望它改变，你知道它会改变。
Because you don't want it to change, and you know it will.

626
00:34:01,571 --> 00:34:03,482
它总是吗?
Does it always?

627
00:34:08,349 --> 00:34:12,717
莉莉的从来没有说过……你和C夫人怎么了?
Lily's never said... What happened with you and Mrs. C?

628
00:34:12,853 --> 00:34:16,126
每段关系中都会发生同样的事情。
Same thing that happens in every relationship.

629
00:34:16,262 --> 00:34:18,856
刚开始的时候，一切都是虚幻的。
When it started out, it was unreal.

630
00:34:20,527 --> 00:34:23,630
然后就变成了现实。
Then it got real.

631
00:34:31,202 --> 00:34:34,912
我们以前常骑自行车去湖边的这个地方。
We used to bike out to this place by the lake.

632
00:34:35,048 --> 00:34:37,611
你知道，读书，吃饭，做什么都行。
You know, read, eat, whatever.

633
00:34:39,011 --> 00:34:43,153
然后有一天，我看到那个地方，那个地方要出售。
And then one day, I saw that that place, that spot was for sale.

634
00:34:43,289 --> 00:34:44,981
那时我们还年轻。我们一无所有。
Now, we were young. We had nothing.

635
00:34:45,116 --> 00:34:48,260
但我说:“总有一天我们应该住在这里。”
But I said, "Someday we should live here."

636
00:34:48,395 --> 00:34:57,928
然后她说，声音里带着微笑……“为什么要等?为什么要把好东西留到以后呢?
And then she said, with that smile in her voice... "Why wait? Why save the good stuff for later?

637
00:34:58,064 --> 00:35:01,563
难道我们不应该在这过程中得到一些好东西吗?”
Don't we deserve some good stuff along the way?"

638
00:35:01,698 --> 00:35:03,934
啊，她是对的。
Ah, she was right.

639
00:35:04,069 --> 00:35:07,674
偶尔会发生。
Which happens occasionally.

640
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:16,881
嗯…我们攒钱，拼抢，然后你知道，我在完美的地方盖了一座完美的房子。
Uh... we saved and we scrambled, and next thing you know, I'm building the perfect house in the perfect spot.

641
00:35:21,858 --> 00:35:25,028
所以，我很忙。我在工作，还我们的债。
So, I was busy. I was working, paying off our debt.

642
00:35:25,163 --> 00:35:27,199
我累了。她累了。
I was tired. She was tired.

643
00:35:29,028 --> 00:35:33,728
然后，很快，我们就感觉根本不像结婚了。
Then, pretty soon, it didn't feel like we were married at all.

644
00:35:33,864 --> 00:35:40,872
只是觉得我们…和一个以前约会过的人一起办日托营。
Just felt like we were... running a day care camp with someone we used to go out with.

645
00:35:44,075 --> 00:35:54,226
我们狙击，我们打架，我们互相诋毁，我想，如果我能让她进那所房子，一切就都好了。
We were sniping, we were fighting, we were tearing each other down, and I thought, if I could just get her in that house, it'd fix everything.

646
00:35:56,226 --> 00:35:58,230
让一切都好。
Make everything okay.

647
00:36:01,133 --> 00:36:07,271
一天晚上，我接到住在湖对面的人打来的电话。
So, one night, I get a call from the people who lived across the lake.

648
00:36:07,406 --> 00:36:10,209
他们说他们看到了这些火焰。
They said they'd seen these flames.

649
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:20,219
我到那里的时候，那里已经变成灰烬了。
By the time I got there, it was just ash.

650
00:36:23,947 --> 00:36:26,885
三周后，我们就完成了。
Three weeks later, we were done.

651
00:36:29,291 --> 00:36:30,724
在一个房子吗?
Over a house?

652
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,793
看起来远不止这些。
Seemed like a lot more than that.

653
00:36:38,729 --> 00:36:40,162
晚安,鹪鹩。
Good night, Wren.

654
00:36:56,182 --> 00:36:59,819
嘿，看来我撑不到婚礼那天早上了。
PAUL Hey, it's looking like I'm not gonna make it till the morning of the wedding.

655
00:36:59,850 --> 00:37:01,488
我很抱歉，宝贝。
I-I'm so sorry, baby.

656
00:37:01,623 --> 00:37:03,722
——莉莉怎么样?-疯狂地爱着。
- How's Lily? - Crazy in love.

657
00:37:03,857 --> 00:37:05,791
——太棒了。——这是可怕的。
- That's fantastic. - It's terrible.

658
00:37:05,927 --> 00:37:08,057
我完全同意。她犯了一个错误。
I couldn't agree more. She's making a mistake.

659
00:37:08,193 --> 00:37:10,160
现在有了某种仪式。
And now there's some kind of ceremony.

660
00:37:10,296 --> 00:37:12,997
格德和莉莉交换戒指。这是一个整体。
Gede and Lily exchange rings. It's a whole thing.

661
00:37:13,132 --> 00:37:15,238
他们不在婚礼上做戒指吗?
They're not doing the rings at the wedding?

662
00:37:15,373 --> 00:37:16,637
不会有婚礼的。
There's not gonna be a wedding.

663
00:37:16,772 --> 00:37:21,810
我不会让她把自己的生活浪费在一个住在世界上最美丽地方的超级帅哥身上。
I won't let her throw her life away on some insanely handsome guy who happens to live in the most beautiful place on Earth.

664
00:37:21,946 --> 00:37:24,118
是的，我知道这听起来很奇怪，但我还是对的。
And yes, I do know how that sounds, but I'm still right.

665
00:37:24,142 --> 00:37:25,779
你总是对的，宝贝。
You're always right, baby.

666
00:37:26,782 --> 00:37:28,262
-我们有行动了。——哦。我真的不是。
- We got action. - Oh. I'm really not.

667
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:30,850
-我得走了。——呃,呃…
- Got to go. - Uh, uh...

668
00:37:33,556 --> 00:37:34,853
-跟我说话。——好的。
- Talk to me. - All right.

669
00:37:34,989 --> 00:37:36,369
这对幸福的情侣就要站在那里了。
The happy couple's about to stand up there.

670
00:37:36,393 --> 00:37:44,514
拿戒指的人带着戴帽子的人祝福过的两枚戒指让他们交换，但如果他们不这样做，就会打乱整个“正确的地点，正确的时间，正确的事情”。
The ring bearer brings two rings that have been blessed by the hat guy for them to exchange, but if they don't, it messes with the whole "right place, right time, right whatever."

671
00:37:44,538 --> 00:37:45,543
-那我们就偷戒指-我正要这么说呢。
- So we steal the rings. - I was about to say that.

672
00:37:45,567 --> 00:37:46,999
但你没有，所以这是我的主意。
But you didn't, so it's my idea.

673
00:37:47,134 --> 00:37:50,006
好吧，拿戒指的人是格德的表弟。
Okay, well, the ring bearer is Gede's cousin.

674
00:37:53,010 --> 00:37:54,379
为什么是我?
Why me?

675
00:37:54,514 --> 00:37:55,952
棘手的事一直是你的强项。
Well, the hard stuff was always your thing.

676
00:37:55,976 --> 00:37:59,037
我的工作是倒垃圾和从高架子上拿东西。
My thing was taking out the garbage and getting things off of high shelves.

677
00:37:59,145 --> 00:38:01,209
没有那么高，真的。奉承是没用的。
Not that high, really. And flattery won't work.

678
00:38:01,344 --> 00:38:03,713
-但你还是会这么做的。——为什么?
- Ah, but you'll do it anyway. - Why?

679
00:38:03,849 --> 00:38:06,149
因为这是你的主意。
Because it was your idea.

680
00:38:15,726 --> 00:38:17,093
嘿,伙计们。
Hey, guys.

681
00:38:17,228 --> 00:38:19,203
你和我们玩追逐游戏吗?
You play chasing game with us?

682
00:38:19,338 --> 00:38:20,935
我能先给你看样东西吗?
Can I show you something first?

683
00:38:21,071 --> 00:38:22,704
让我给你看样东西。
Let me show you something.

684
00:38:22,839 --> 00:38:27,806
因为，我来自美国，在美国，我们吃香蕉有点不一样。
'Cause, see, I'm from America, and in America, we eat bananas a little differently.

685
00:38:27,942 --> 00:38:31,609
我们在剥之前先把它们切片。
We slice them before we peel them.

686
00:38:31,744 --> 00:38:33,114
不是真的!
Not true!

687
00:38:33,250 --> 00:38:34,978
完全正确的。
Totally true.

688
00:38:35,113 --> 00:38:36,987
来，我指给你看。到这里来。
Uh, here, I'll show you. Come here.

689
00:38:37,122 --> 00:38:38,786
过来坐上来。
Come sit up here.

690
00:38:40,193 --> 00:38:41,422
好的。看到这个香蕉了吗?
All right. See this banana?

691
00:38:41,558 --> 00:38:43,054
完全正常,对吧?
Totally normal-looking, right?

692
00:38:43,189 --> 00:38:44,791
-它不是从外面切开的。,而不是减少。
- It's not cut on the outside. - Not cut.

693
00:38:44,927 --> 00:38:47,991
好吧，我想让你拿着它……来，把你的包放下。
All right, so I want you to take it... Here, put your bag down.

694
00:38:48,127 --> 00:38:50,292
你要把它剥了。
You're gonna take it and peel it.

695
00:38:58,870 --> 00:39:00,507
就是这么做的。
That's how it's done.

696
00:39:06,147 --> 00:39:12,457
所以，我们将互赠的戒指已经在Pura Ulun Danu Batur的圣水中得到了祝福。
So, the rings that we'll give each other have been blessed in the sacred water of Pura Ulun Danu Batur.

697
00:39:13,456 --> 00:39:15,394
我做困难的事。
I do the hard stuff.

698
00:39:17,454 --> 00:39:20,093
真不敢相信他们中了香蕉的圈套。
Can't believe they fell for the banana trick.

699
00:39:20,229 --> 00:39:24,299
你还没搞清楚，真是要命。——啊……也许我们可以给你看看。
Really kills you that you haven't figured it out. -Ah... Maybe we'll show them to you.

700
00:39:24,435 --> 00:39:26,662
赖爷拿着呢。Ketut吗?
Uh, Ketut has them. Ketut?

701
00:39:26,797 --> 00:39:28,665
我们开始吧。
Here we go.

702
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,539
嘿。
Hey.

703
00:39:30,675 --> 00:39:32,906
你能给我们看看戒指吗?是吗?
Can you show us the rings? Yeah?

704
00:39:34,137 --> 00:39:36,710
嗯。戒指在哪里?
Hmm. Where are the rings?

705
00:39:36,846 --> 00:39:38,544
-里面什么都没有——嘘。
- There's nothing in there. - Shh.

706
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:39,680
它是空的。
It's empty.

707
00:39:41,114 --> 00:39:42,185
这是一去不复返了。好的。
It's gone. Okay.

708
00:39:45,984 --> 00:39:47,855
Losi !
Losi!

709
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:51,856
他在说什么?
What is he saying?

710
00:39:51,992 --> 00:39:53,725
-我没在听——酷。
- I-I wasn't listening. - Cool.

711
00:39:55,863 --> 00:39:57,831
"我们必须拿到戒指"
Uh, "We have to have the rings"

712
00:39:57,966 --> 00:39:59,369
只要情况合适。”
for the circumstances to be right."

713
00:39:59,504 --> 00:40:00,833
是的。嗯。
Yeah. Hmm.

714
00:40:00,969 --> 00:40:03,403
现在没人知道该怎么办。
Now no one knows what to do.

715
00:40:03,539 --> 00:40:04,907
赖爷在哭。
And Ketut is crying.

716
00:40:05,043 --> 00:40:07,073
哦。
Aw.

717
00:40:07,208 --> 00:40:09,709
亲爱的，没事的。告诉她会没事的。
Hey, sweetie, it's okay. Tell her it's gonna be okay.

718
00:40:09,844 --> 00:40:11,374
不会没事的。
It's not gonna be okay.

719
00:40:11,509 --> 00:40:13,469
听着，如果我们没有戒指，我们就不能…
Look, if we don't have the rings, then we can't...

720
00:40:17,656 --> 00:40:19,323
你是对的。这不是问题。
You're right. It's not a problem.

721
00:40:19,458 --> 00:40:20,738
-我们会找到其他戒指的。-是的。
- We'll find other rings. - Yeah.

722
00:40:20,822 --> 00:40:22,384
你听到了吗?它很好。
Did you hear that? It's fine.

723
00:40:22,519 --> 00:40:24,661
改天再做吧。没关系。
We'll just do it another day. It's okay.

724
00:40:31,335 --> 00:40:33,698
它们看起来怎么样?
How do they look?

725
00:40:33,834 --> 00:40:35,599
我要做伸展运动。
I'll do the stretch thing.

726
00:40:35,734 --> 00:40:37,338
经典的。
The classic.

727
00:40:40,971 --> 00:40:42,245
失望。
Disappointed.

728
00:40:42,381 --> 00:40:43,674
——这很好。——是吗?
- That's good. - Is it?

729
00:40:43,809 --> 00:40:45,243
你是什么意思?
What do you mean?

730
00:40:45,378 --> 00:40:47,058
我是说我们的女儿看起来就像她的狗刚死了一样。
I mean our daughter looks like her dog just died.

731
00:40:47,082 --> 00:40:48,943
我不知道我是否对此感觉良好。-哦。
I don't know if I feel great about that. -Oh.

732
00:40:49,079 --> 00:40:50,415
我们接近那里。
We're nearly there.

733
00:40:50,550 --> 00:40:52,385
在哪里?
Where?

734
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:54,218
你会看到。
You'll see.

735
00:40:55,253 --> 00:40:56,719
我想他知道。
I think he knows.

736
00:40:56,854 --> 00:40:58,392
他不知道。
He doesn't know.

737
00:41:00,367 --> 00:41:02,365
好的。
Okay.

738
00:41:02,501 --> 00:41:04,133
-他们来了吗?——它们在这里。
- Are they here? - They're here.

739
00:41:04,268 --> 00:41:05,933
这里是谁?
Who's here?

740
00:41:11,401 --> 00:41:13,237
海豚。
Dolphins.

741
00:41:16,049 --> 00:41:17,478
你在开玩笑吧?
Are you kidding?

742
00:41:17,614 --> 00:41:19,782
它变得更好。
It gets better.

743
00:41:21,914 --> 00:41:23,716
你在做什么?
What are you doing?

744
00:41:23,851 --> 00:41:25,715
啊，别害怕，科顿先生。
Ah, don't be afraid, Mr. Cotton.

745
00:41:25,850 --> 00:41:27,383
我不害怕
I'm not afraid.

746
00:41:27,519 --> 00:41:29,261
- GEORGIA你是。-不，我没有。
- GEORGIA You are. - No, I'm not.

747
00:41:29,396 --> 00:41:31,626
我不害怕
I'm not afraid.

748
00:41:31,761 --> 00:41:38,031
嘿。什么是你…天啊，这太棒了。
Hey. What are you... Oh, my God, this is amazing.

749
00:41:55,421 --> 00:41:57,215
妈妈。
Mom.

750
00:42:00,056 --> 00:42:01,689
你确定它们不是鲨鱼吗?
Hey, are you sure they're not sharks?

751
00:42:01,824 --> 00:42:03,022
他们不是鲨鱼。
They're not sharks.

752
00:42:03,158 --> 00:42:05,772
他们可能在和鲨鱼合作，你知道的，来抓我们。哦,爸爸。
They might be working with the sharks, you know, to get us. Oh, Dad.

753
00:42:05,796 --> 00:42:07,358
不要错过。来吧。进去。
Don't miss out. Come on. Get in.

754
00:42:07,493 --> 00:42:09,108
别这样，别胆怯。不要错过。
Come on, don't be a chicken. Don't miss out.

755
00:42:09,132 --> 00:42:10,270
我不是胆小鬼。来吧,鸡。
I'm not a chicken. Come on, chicken.

756
00:42:10,294 --> 00:42:11,492
哦,阻止它。
Oh, stop it.

757
00:42:11,628 --> 00:42:13,045
你年纪大了就变成胆小鬼了。
You've turned chicken in your old age.

758
00:42:13,069 --> 00:42:14,640
-来吧，大卫。——我是鸡吗?哦,鸡吗?
- Come on, David. - I'm chicken? Oh, chicken?

759
00:42:14,664 --> 00:42:16,441
我给你看鸡肉。给你鸡。
I'll show you chicken. Show you chicken.

760
00:42:16,577 --> 00:42:17,875
我去。我们走吧。
I'll go. Let's go.

761
00:42:25,947 --> 00:42:27,619
哦。
Ooh.

762
00:42:27,754 --> 00:42:29,279
真不敢相信我被海豚咬了。
I can't believe I got bit by a dolphin.

763
00:42:29,414 --> 00:42:31,280
你是擦伤了。
You were grazed.

764
00:42:31,416 --> 00:42:32,976
这种情况以前从未发生过。是的。
This has never happened before. Yeah.

765
00:42:33,092 --> 00:42:34,215
爸爸?
Dad?

766
00:42:34,351 --> 00:42:35,987
爸爸,爸爸。小心他!
Dad, Dad. Be careful with him!

767
00:42:36,122 --> 00:42:37,685
疼吗?
Does it hurt?

768
00:42:37,820 --> 00:42:39,828
我打赌是那个笑得很疯狂的人。
I bet it was that crazy-looking one with the smile.

769
00:42:39,964 --> 00:42:42,059
-所有海豚都会微笑。-现在我们知道原因了。
- All dolphins smile. - Now we know why.

770
00:42:42,194 --> 00:42:44,060
-这不是Gede的错。-是的。
- It wasn't Gede's fault. - Yeah.

771
00:42:44,196 --> 00:42:45,305
我们知道。这些事情发生。
We know. These things happen.

772
00:42:45,329 --> 00:42:47,131
不，他只是说他们不知道。
No, he did just say they don't.

773
00:42:47,267 --> 00:42:49,032
乔治娅，你能压一下吗?
Georgia, can you please apply pressure?

774
00:42:49,167 --> 00:42:51,037
我去拿些绷带。
I'm gonna go grab some bandages.

775
00:42:51,173 --> 00:42:52,867
我们可不想让你失去腿。
We wouldn't want you to lose your leg.

776
00:42:53,002 --> 00:42:54,304
什么?
What?

777
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:56,439
今天失去的东西已经够多了。
Enough things have already been lost today.

778
00:42:59,451 --> 00:43:00,685
哦,是的。他知道。
Oh, yeah. He knows.

779
00:43:02,220 --> 00:43:03,956
——噢!你怎么了?-我这么做的时候疼吗?
- Ow! What's wrong with you? - Does it hurt when I do that?

780
00:43:03,980 --> 00:43:12,423
他说压力。他说，“格鲁吉亚，压力。”就好像我抬起头，发现我想要的一切就在我面前。
He said pressure. He said, "Georgia, pressure." - - It's like I looked up and realized that everything I ever wanted was right in front of me.

781
00:43:12,559 --> 00:43:22,067
是啊，我可以回去试着把它做好，但我知道，每一秒，我都在梦想着来到这里……和他在一起。
Yeah, I could go back and try and make a go of it, but I just know that, every second, I'd be dreaming of being here... with him.

782
00:43:22,203 --> 00:43:24,003
就像你常说的
You know, it's like you always say:

783
00:43:24,138 --> 00:43:26,172
为什么要把好东西留到以后呢?
Why save the good stuff for later?

784
00:43:27,312 --> 00:43:29,340
是的,我做的。
Yeah, I do.

785
00:43:30,842 --> 00:43:32,116
我做的事。
I do.

786
00:43:32,251 --> 00:43:33,284
原谅我。
Excuse me.

787
00:43:33,419 --> 00:43:34,714
我想买这些。
I'd like to get these.

788
00:43:34,849 --> 00:43:36,115
你是游客,是吗?
You're tourists, yes?

789
00:43:36,251 --> 00:43:38,580
她的确是，但我现在住在这里。
Oh, well, she is, but I live here now.

790
00:43:40,551 --> 00:43:42,756
啊。然后我们讨价还价。哦。
Ah. Then we haggle. Oh.

791
00:43:42,891 --> 00:43:44,185
不，我们没必要讨价还价。
Uh, no, we don't need to haggle.

792
00:43:44,321 --> 00:43:45,429
给我一个合理的价格。
Just give me a fair price.

793
00:43:45,564 --> 00:43:47,762
游客喜欢我们砍价。
Tourists like it when we haggle.

794
00:43:47,897 --> 00:43:49,892
美国人喜欢做划算的交易。
Americans like make good deals.

795
00:43:50,027 --> 00:43:52,069
800000卢比吗?
800,000 rupiah?

796
00:43:52,204 --> 00:43:53,428
好的。
Okay.

797
00:43:53,564 --> 00:43:56,235
不,不。你说500000。
No, no. You say 500,000.

798
00:43:58,041 --> 00:43:59,935
就这样吧，妈妈。
Just go with it, Mom.

799
00:44:00,070 --> 00:44:02,547
嗯,500000。
Um, 500,000.

800
00:44:02,682 --> 00:44:04,213
请足够。我杀死你。
Enough, please. You're killing me.

801
00:44:04,348 --> 00:44:05,348
七。
Seven.

802
00:44:05,452 --> 00:44:07,910
六个，否则我就走。
Six, or I'm walking away.

803
00:44:08,045 --> 00:44:09,220
我们一言为定。
We have a deal.

804
00:44:09,356 --> 00:44:11,320
谢谢你！
Thank you.

805
00:44:13,024 --> 00:44:14,818
我真是太感激你了，妈妈。
I'm just so crazy grateful for you, Mom.

806
00:44:14,953 --> 00:44:16,490
这是没有必要的。
There's no need.

807
00:44:16,626 --> 00:44:18,259
是的,有。
Yes, there is.

808
00:44:18,395 --> 00:44:20,555
这是我这辈子做过的最重大的决定。
This is the biggest decision I've ever made in my life.

809
00:44:20,593 --> 00:44:22,932
你跑了半个地球来支持我。
You came halfway around the world to have my back.

810
00:44:24,561 --> 00:44:27,831
你是一个非常善良的女人。
You are a very kind woman.

811
00:44:27,966 --> 00:44:29,273
谢谢你！
Thank you.

812
00:44:29,409 --> 00:44:31,402
我真的不是。我…
I'm really not. I...

813
00:44:34,078 --> 00:44:36,910
我不知道这是什么，但我喜欢。
I don't know what this is, but I like it.

814
00:44:37,045 --> 00:44:39,141
是的，它叫martabak。
Yeah, it's called a martabak.

815
00:44:39,277 --> 00:44:41,313
——Martabak ?
- Martabak? - Mm.

816
00:44:41,449 --> 00:44:46,782
听着，莉莉和我会去买其他戒指，但如果你把戒指还给我就更好了。
Listen, um, Lily and I will get other rings, but it would be much better if you just give them back.

817
00:44:46,917 --> 00:44:48,957
你在说什么?我没有你的戒指。
What are you talking about? I don't have your rings.

818
00:44:48,985 --> 00:44:51,523
我什么都没跟莉莉说，我也不会说的。
I didn't say anything to Lily, and I won't.

819
00:44:51,659 --> 00:44:54,019
但是，科顿先生，我需要你和乔治娅马上停下来。
But, Mr. Cotton, I need you and Georgia to stop now, please.

820
00:44:54,099 --> 00:45:02,051
你知道我怎么想吗?我觉得你什么都没跟莉莉说是因为你怕她有疑虑，如果你说了什么，她可能会听到你的疑虑，或者更糟，
You know what I think? I think you didn't say anything to Lily because you're afraid she might be having doubts, and if you did say something, she might listen to those doubts, or worse than that,

821
00:45:02,075 --> 00:45:07,585
——她可能会采取行动。-我什么都没告诉莉莉，因为我知道让她知道她父母终于和好的真正原因会让她很伤心
- she might act on them. - I haven't told Lily anything because I know it would hurt her very much to know that the real reason her parents are finally getting along

822
00:45:07,609 --> 00:45:09,319
是因为他们联合起来破坏她的感情。
is because they're united to sabotage her relationship.

823
00:45:09,343 --> 00:45:11,245
如果这里有人害怕，那就是你。
If anyone here is afraid, it's you.

824
00:45:12,281 --> 00:45:14,041
我不是来把你女儿从你身边抢走的。
I'm not here to steal your daughter from you.

825
00:45:14,117 --> 00:45:15,643
那是我最不愿意做的事。
That's the last thing I want to do.

826
00:45:15,779 --> 00:45:18,354
她不是比赛的胜负之分。
She's not a competition to be won or lost.

827
00:45:18,489 --> 00:45:20,452
听着,相信我。
Look, trust me.

828
00:45:20,587 --> 00:45:24,928
如果莉莉发现你们在做什么，你肯定会失去她。
If Lily finds out what you two are really doing, you'll most certainly lose her then.

829
00:45:26,027 --> 00:45:27,766
享受你的martabak。
Enjoy your martabak.

830
00:45:32,597 --> 00:45:36,166
提醒我一下，特洛伊木马里的人是好人吗?
Remind me, were the guys in the Trojan horse the good guys?

831
00:45:36,302 --> 00:45:37,741
无论好坏，他们赢得了战争。
Good or bad, they won the war.

832
00:45:37,876 --> 00:45:39,405
这场战争到底是为了什么?
And what was the war about exactly?

833
00:45:39,540 --> 00:45:41,353
-别这样，乔治娅-你觉得我们错了吗?
- Don't do this, Georgia. - Do you think we're wrong?

834
00:45:41,377 --> 00:45:43,189
-我们没有错。-我想我们可能错了。
- We're not wrong. - I think we might be wrong.

835
00:45:43,213 --> 00:45:44,822
还记得我们说好要一起做这件事吗?
Remember when we agreed to do this together?

836
00:45:44,846 --> 00:45:46,246
要步调一致?
To be in lockstep?

837
00:45:46,382 --> 00:45:48,917
是的，但那是在我们见到她之前…看到他们。
Yeah, but that was before we saw her... saw them.

838
00:45:49,052 --> 00:45:50,849
哦,你知道…哦,太棒了。
Oh, you know... Oh, great.

839
00:45:50,985 --> 00:45:52,823
经典。你赢了。
Classic. You win again.

840
00:45:52,959 --> 00:45:54,631
-这是什么意思?-你知道吗?
- What does that even mean? - You know what?

841
00:45:54,655 --> 00:45:56,761
我每周有一天和莉莉在一起，每隔一个周末。
I had Lily one day a week and every other weekend.

842
00:45:56,897 --> 00:45:59,063
其他时间她都在你身边。
You had her all the rest of the time.

843
00:45:59,199 --> 00:46:03,746
她听你的，依赖你，而现在你却成了那个满足她一切要求的人。
I mean, she listened to you, she relied on you, and now you get to be the one that gives her everything she wants.

844
00:46:03,837 --> 00:46:05,502
我从没给过她想要的。
I never get to give her what she wants.

845
00:46:05,638 --> 00:46:06,770
是的，我在她身边。
Yes, I was there for her.

846
00:46:06,906 --> 00:46:08,773
制定规则，与之战斗。
To make the rules, to fight with.

847
00:46:08,909 --> 00:46:14,647
你很有趣，爸爸。你会轻飘飘地进来，带她去她想去的地方，给她买任何她想要的东西，然后让她下车，然后开车离开。-我不想那样。
You were fun dad. You would breeze in, take her where she wanted to go, buy her anything she wanted, then drop her off - and drive away. - I didn't want that.

848
00:46:14,671 --> 00:46:15,889
那你就不该走。
Well, then you shouldn't have left.

849
00:46:15,913 --> 00:46:16,989
-我必须这么做。一切都结束了。——为什么?
- I had to. It was over. - Why?

850
00:46:17,013 --> 00:46:18,213
因为房子被烧毁了?
Because the house burned down?

851
00:46:18,246 --> 00:46:19,321
因为你不再爱我了。
Because you didn't love me anymore.

852
00:46:19,345 --> 00:46:20,575
你甚至都不喜欢我。
Well, you didn't even like me.

853
00:46:20,711 --> 00:46:21,996
你一点都不尊重我。
You didn't have any respect for me.

854
00:46:22,020 --> 00:46:23,127
你从来都不尊重我。
You've never had any respect for me.

855
00:46:23,151 --> 00:46:24,449
这太不真实了。
That is so unbelievably untrue.

856
00:46:24,584 --> 00:46:29,170
你求婚的时候，你是真的想结婚，还是不想让我接受洛杉矶的那份工作?-我想要快乐。
When you proposed, did you really want to get married, or you just didn't want me to take - that job in L.A.? - I wanted to be happy.

857
00:46:29,194 --> 00:46:30,406
-我想让你幸福。-我现在很开心。
- I wanted you to be happy. - Well, I am happy now.

858
00:46:30,430 --> 00:46:31,430
很好。我也一样。
Good. So am I.

859
00:46:31,530 --> 00:46:32,530
——好。——太棒了。
- Good. - Great.

860
00:46:32,562 --> 00:46:33,722
太好了。
Great.

861
00:47:13,803 --> 00:47:14,833
-嗨。-嗨。
- Hi. - Hey.

862
00:47:14,968 --> 00:47:15,999
现在几点了?
What time is it?

863
00:47:16,135 --> 00:47:17,165
最好的时间。
The best time.

864
00:47:19,738 --> 00:47:21,678
你看起来不像在睡觉。
You don't look like you were sleeping.

865
00:47:21,813 --> 00:47:24,345
嗯，我睡前会保湿。
Mm. I moisturize before bed.

866
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:26,449
好的。好了，我们醒醒吧……哦。
All right. Well, let's wake up... Oh.

867
00:47:26,584 --> 00:47:28,117
这是怎么呢
What's going on?

868
00:47:29,082 --> 00:47:31,956
-嗨。-嗨。
- Hi. - Hi.

869
00:47:35,095 --> 00:47:39,122
好吧，我有个小任务要交给你们。
Okay, um, I've got a little job for you guys.

870
00:47:39,257 --> 00:47:40,694
来吧。我们走吧。
Come on. Let's go.

871
00:47:48,907 --> 00:47:51,503
真不敢相信我们在外面。
I can't believe we're out here.

872
00:47:51,639 --> 00:47:54,336
你受了伤，我不确定你是否该这样。
I'm not sure you should be, with your wound.

873
00:47:54,472 --> 00:47:56,508
鲨鱼喜欢血。
Sharks are drawn to blood.

874
00:48:02,183 --> 00:48:04,516
她总是听你的。
She listened to you always.

875
00:48:06,282 --> 00:48:07,820
什么?
What?

876
00:48:07,955 --> 00:48:09,322
她仍然。
She still does.

877
00:48:09,457 --> 00:48:12,931
她从不需要让我像她想让你那样幸福。
She never needed to make me as happy as she wanted to make you.

878
00:48:15,861 --> 00:48:19,570
她只是……所以喜欢你。
She's just... so like you.

879
00:48:19,706 --> 00:48:22,171
我觉得她很像你。
I think she's so like you.

880
00:48:26,980 --> 00:48:29,003
我再告诉你一件事。
Um, and I'll tell you something else.

881
00:48:29,139 --> 00:48:41,124
我看着你的海藻堆，看着我的，然后…当然，这完全不是竞争，但如果这是…我会赢。
I'm looking at your pile of seaweed and at mine, and... and, of course, it's totally not a competition, but if it was... I'd be winning.

882
00:48:44,128 --> 00:48:45,828
还好这不是一场比赛。
Good thing it's not a competition.

883
00:48:45,964 --> 00:48:48,025
-嗯，这是件好事-是的。
- Mm, it's a good thing. - Yeah.

884
00:48:56,904 --> 00:48:59,704
嘿,嘿,温柔。你应该温柔一点!
Hey, hey, gentle. You're supposed to be gentle!

885
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:01,840
放开我，放开我，放开我!打扰一下。啊!
Get off me, get off, get off me! Excuse me. Aah!

886
00:49:01,913 --> 00:49:03,110
那是我的。那是我的。
That's mine. That's mine.

887
00:49:03,245 --> 00:49:04,713
啊!下车。
Aah! Get off.

888
00:49:04,848 --> 00:49:06,049
嘿!
Hey!

889
00:49:06,185 --> 00:49:08,681
下车。下车!下车!
Get off. Get off! Get off!

890
00:49:08,816 --> 00:49:10,545
你在做什么?这是我的。
What are you doing? That was mine.

891
00:49:10,681 --> 00:49:12,185
这是我的。你把我的。
That was mine. You took mine.

892
00:49:12,321 --> 00:49:14,415
-你能别说了吗?——离开。
- Will you stop it? - Get off.

893
00:49:15,861 --> 00:49:17,692
这越来越奇怪了。
Well, this is getting weird.

894
00:49:26,236 --> 00:49:28,729
这招很管用，直到失效。
Well, that worked till it didn't.

895
00:49:28,865 --> 00:49:31,407
他们有了新戒指。
They got new rings.

896
00:49:31,542 --> 00:49:33,734
谢谢你今早帮忙收庄稼。
Thank you for helping with the harvest this morning.

897
00:49:33,870 --> 00:49:35,570
谁赢了?
Who won?

898
00:49:35,705 --> 00:49:37,471
不，这不是一场比赛。
No, it wasn't a competition.

899
00:49:41,012 --> 00:49:42,786
你告诉她这不是比赛，对吧?
You told her it wasn't a competition, right?

900
00:49:42,921 --> 00:49:44,117
我就是这么说的。
That is exactly what I said.

901
00:49:44,252 --> 00:49:45,780
这个拥抱还有别的意思。
The hug is about something else.

902
00:49:45,915 --> 00:49:48,055
好的方面。Metatah已经开始。
Oke deh. Metatah is beginning.

903
00:49:48,190 --> 00:49:49,493
——Metatah。——什么?
- Metatah. - What?

904
00:49:49,628 --> 00:49:51,260
Metatah。
Metatah.

905
00:49:53,089 --> 00:49:55,591
你和我是一伙的，对吧?同步?
You're with me in this, right? Lockstep?

906
00:49:55,726 --> 00:49:56,931
——因循守旧。——同步。
- Lockstep. - In lockstep.

907
00:49:57,067 --> 00:49:58,729
——当然。——好的。
- Absolutely. - Okay.

908
00:50:13,449 --> 00:50:15,317
这是怎么回事?
How is this even a thing?

909
00:50:15,452 --> 00:50:21,854
噢!他们认为，锉掉犬齿会让我们远离动物，从而远离导致不幸婚姻的品质。
Ow! They believe that filing down the canine teeth takes us away from the animals, so away from qualities that lead to an unhappy marriage.

910
00:50:21,989 --> 00:50:25,659
它夺走了咀嚼固体食物的能力。
Takes away the ability to chew solid food, is what it does.

911
00:50:28,729 --> 00:50:30,792
我认识一个人，他想娶一个犹太女人。
I knew a guy who wanted to marry a Jewish woman.

912
00:50:30,927 --> 00:50:32,864
不得不割包皮。这是更糟。
Had to get circumcised. This is worse.

913
00:50:35,967 --> 00:50:38,307
不,那是更糟。
No, that's worse.

914
00:50:41,081 --> 00:50:43,037
哦，疼吗?嗯。
Oh, did it hurt? Hmm.

915
00:50:43,172 --> 00:50:45,048
我是说，真的有看上去那么糟吗?
I mean, was it as bad as it looked?

916
00:50:45,184 --> 00:50:46,843
这是非常痛苦的痛苦。
It was very painful agony.

917
00:50:46,978 --> 00:50:48,710
所以我们才来这里打麻醉剂。
Which is why we're here for some anesthetic.

918
00:50:48,845 --> 00:50:49,851
给你。
Here you go.

919
00:50:49,986 --> 00:50:51,184
烧酒。
Arrack all around.

920
00:50:51,320 --> 00:50:52,981
谢谢。烧酒是什么?
Thanks. What's arrack?

921
00:50:53,116 --> 00:50:57,190
我不知道，但我上次来的时候，发现自己躺在树上嘴里含着沙子。
I don't know, but last time I was here, I woke up in a tree with all this sand in my mouth.

922
00:50:57,326 --> 00:50:58,989
哦。
Oh.

00:56:14,271 --> 00:56:15,631
——什么?-那是我男朋友保罗。
- What? - That's my boyfriend Paul.

1058
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:17,052
你告诉他你不喜欢惊喜了吗?
Did you tell him you don't like surprises?

1059
00:56:17,076 --> 00:56:20,683
哦,我的天啊。他给我的惊喜太多了他给我的惊喜几乎都不算是惊喜了。
Oh, my gosh. He surprises me so much it's almost not a surprise when he surprises me.

1060
00:56:20,818 --> 00:56:25,883
格鲁吉亚?是我。这是保罗。好的。等待。我…我偷偷摸摸。分散他的注意力。什么?什么?
Georgia? It's me. It's Paul. Okay. Wait. I... I'm sneaking around. Distract him. What? What?

1061
00:56:26,019 --> 00:56:27,523
——分散他!-你分散他的注意力。
- Distract him! - You distract him.

1062
00:56:27,658 --> 00:56:29,526
乔治娅，开门。他妈的!
Georgia, open the door. Fuck!

1063
00:56:30,523 --> 00:56:31,821
嗨,保罗。
Hey, Paul.

1064
00:56:31,956 --> 00:56:35,464
大卫，我以为这是…——格鲁吉亚的房间吗?-是的。
David, uh, I thought this was... - Georgia's room? - Yeah.

1065
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:37,295
不，这是我的房间。这是她的房间。
No, it's my room. That's her room.

1066
00:56:37,430 --> 00:56:39,075
这是我的房间。嗨,亲爱的。我想我听到你说话了。-你好。
This is my room. Hi, sweetie. I thought I heard you. -Hi.

1067
00:56:39,099 --> 00:56:40,902
-在那个房间里。-那是我的房间，这个房间。
- In that room. - Which is my room, this room.

1068
00:56:41,037 --> 00:56:43,115
-但我以为那家伙说…-不，我们换了房间。
- But I thought the guy said... - No, we changed rooms.

1069
00:56:43,139 --> 00:56:45,459
-这样这里就可以是我的房间了。-这房间好多了。
- So that this could be my room. - It's a much better room.

1070
00:56:45,510 --> 00:56:47,203
-是的。——哦,太棒了。我能看看吗?
- Yeah. - Oh, great. C-Can I see it?

1071
00:56:47,338 --> 00:56:49,471
是的,但首先……宝贝，你介意吗?
Yes, but first... Oh, baby, do you mind?

1072
00:56:49,606 --> 00:56:52,174
你能帮我拿一大桶咖啡吗?
Could you just get me a great big bucket of coffee?

1073
00:56:52,309 --> 00:56:53,469
是的,是的。什么都给你。
Yeah, yeah. Anything for you.

1074
00:56:57,552 --> 00:56:59,215
你一直在做瑜伽。
You've been doing yoga.

1075
00:57:00,853 --> 00:57:02,486
不，我只是喜欢这条裤子。
No, I just like the pants.

1076
00:57:09,158 --> 00:57:11,396
快，我们在换房间!
Quick, we're changing rooms!

1077
00:57:11,531 --> 00:57:13,669
噢!大便。噢!
Ooh! Shit. Ooh!

1078
00:57:15,139 --> 00:57:16,603
好的。哦。
Okay. Ooh.

1079
00:57:16,739 --> 00:57:24,880
如果我犹豫一秒钟……这么说吧，有170个人很幸运我没有。
If I had hesitated just one second... Well, let's just say there's 170 souls that are lucky I didn't.

1080
00:57:25,016 --> 00:57:26,249
和我。
And me.

1081
00:57:26,384 --> 00:57:28,077
所以171吗?嘿。
So 171? Hey.

1082
00:57:28,212 --> 00:57:29,576
-你们去哪了?——哦。
- Where have you guys been? - Oh.

1083
00:57:29,712 --> 00:57:32,917
-你看到保罗在这里了吗?-他就站在我们旁边-计划是什么?
- Did you see Paul's here? - He's literally standing - right next to us. - So, what's the plan?

1084
00:57:33,053 --> 00:57:35,877
我在想我们可以去努萨·佩尼达岛。嗯。
Uh, I was thinking we could visit the island of Nusa Penida. Hmm.

1085
00:57:35,925 --> 00:57:37,423
地球上看日落最好的地方。
Best place on Earth to watch a sunset.

1086
00:57:37,558 --> 00:57:39,091
这听起来太棒了。
That sounds great.

1087
00:57:39,227 --> 00:57:43,465
我在旅游指南上读到关于，参观塔纳洛特的寺庙?
Now, I've been reading in the guidebooks about, uh, visiting the temple at Tanah Lot?

1088
00:57:43,600 --> 00:57:46,961
呃，我不认为那是…好吧，我去叫辆出租车，好吗?
Uh, I don't think that's, uh... Okay, why don't I get us some cabs, okay?

1089
00:57:47,096 --> 00:57:48,802
给我们叫几辆出租车!
Get us a couple cabs!

1090
00:57:48,937 --> 00:57:51,399
我觉得努萨·佩尼达更好。
I think Nusa Penida would be better.

1091
00:57:51,534 --> 00:57:53,368
我们在塔娜洛特之后再去，好吗?
We'll do that right after Tanah Lot, okay?

1092
00:57:54,845 --> 00:57:57,478
你好。你知道塔娜·罗得在哪吗?
Hi. Hey, do you know where Tanah Lot is?

1093
00:57:57,614 --> 00:57:59,373
这是一个寺庙。是的。
It's a temple. Yeah.

1094
00:57:59,509 --> 00:58:01,381
来吧，伙计们!
Here we go, guys!

1095
00:58:01,516 --> 00:58:03,049
来吧!来吧!
Come on! Come on!

1096
00:58:22,770 --> 00:58:24,636
你没事吧?
You okay?

1097
00:58:24,771 --> 00:58:26,139
我们不应该在这里。
We shouldn't be here.

1098
00:58:26,275 --> 00:58:27,670
为什么?
Why?

1099
00:58:27,806 --> 00:58:29,573
看起来不可思议。
Looks amazing.

1100
00:58:29,708 --> 00:58:31,407
这是诅咒。
It's cursed.

1101
00:58:31,543 --> 00:58:36,818
传统上说，任何造访塔纳罗得的未婚夫妇都不会有幸福的婚姻。
Tradition says any unwed couple that visits Tanah Lot will never have happiness in marriage.

1102
00:58:38,317 --> 00:58:41,356
我爸不可能知道的。
Well, my dad couldn't have known that.

1103
00:58:41,491 --> 00:58:43,587
我相信你是对的。
I'm sure you're right.

1104
00:58:43,722 --> 00:58:45,259
哦,嘿。
Well, hey.

1105
00:58:45,395 --> 00:58:46,922
我们先走了。
Let's just go.

1106
00:58:47,058 --> 00:58:49,591
-你确定?-是的。
- You sure? - Yeah.

1107
00:58:49,727 --> 00:58:53,494
我打赌一个诅咒可不能把我们搞得一团糟。
Bet it would take a lot more than a curse to mess us up.

1108
00:58:53,629 --> 00:58:56,006
也许其他情侣就没这么幸运了。
Maybe other couples who aren't so lucky.

1109
00:59:09,349 --> 00:59:11,130
显然，这里被称为蛇洞。
Apparently, these are called the snake caves.

1110
00:59:11,154 --> 00:59:14,051
哦,我的上帝。远离阳光的感觉真好。
Oh, my God. It feels so good to get out of the sun.

1111
00:59:14,187 --> 00:59:17,060
感觉我的宿醉还在宿醉。
Feel like my hangover has a hangover.

1112
00:59:19,991 --> 00:59:21,359
你在做什么?
What are you doing?

1113
00:59:21,495 --> 00:59:23,064
格鲁吉亚?
Georgia?

1114
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:24,628
是吗?
Yes?

1115
00:59:24,763 --> 00:59:26,830
我爱你。
I love you.

1116
00:59:26,966 --> 00:59:30,566
你既美丽又善良。
You are gorgeous and kind.

1117
00:59:31,968 --> 00:59:33,337
有趣的和聪明的。
Funny and smart.

1118
00:59:33,472 --> 00:59:35,232
你是我想要和需要的一切。
You're everything I could ever want and need.

1119
00:59:36,175 --> 00:59:38,873
你愿意嫁给我吗?
Will you marry me?

1120
00:59:39,008 --> 00:59:41,018
哦。哇,保罗。
Oh. Whoa, Paul.

1121
00:59:41,153 --> 00:59:46,484
我很……我很感动，而且…现在还觉得恶心。
I'm so... I'm so touched and... and nauseous right now.

1122
00:59:46,619 --> 00:59:52,491
嗯…我该怎么说呢?
Um... Uh, how do I put this?

1123
00:59:52,626 --> 00:59:58,530
嗯,大卫……大卫昨晚在我房间过的夜。
Um, David... David spent the night in my room last night.

1124
00:59:58,665 --> 01:00:00,869
我很抱歉。
I'm sorry.

1125
01:00:05,673 --> 01:00:07,273
我知道。
I know.

1126
01:00:07,409 --> 01:00:08,609
哦。
Oh.

1127
01:00:08,745 --> 01:00:12,247
男人不穿瑜伽裤，即使在做瑜伽的时候。
Men don't wear yoga pants, uh, even when they do yoga.

1128
01:00:12,382 --> 01:00:13,573
哦。好的。
Oh. Okay.

1129
01:00:13,709 --> 01:00:15,280
我是说，天啊，什么都没发生。
I mean, oh, my God, nothing happened.

1130
01:00:15,415 --> 01:00:17,554
不是那样的。永远不会是那样的。
It's not like that. It would just never be like that.

1131
01:00:17,689 --> 01:00:19,952
——停止它。阻止它。——好的。好的。
- Stop it. Stop it. - Okay. Okay.

1132
01:00:20,088 --> 01:00:22,623
-我相信你。——好的。谢谢你！
- I trust you. - Okay. Thank you.

1133
01:00:22,759 --> 01:00:24,928
谢谢你！
Thank you.

1134
01:00:25,064 --> 01:00:30,232
我…我相信你。
I... I trust you.

1135
01:00:30,367 --> 01:00:32,359
是的。谢谢你！
Yeah. Thank you.

1136
01:00:34,098 --> 01:00:35,970
你怎么这么奇怪?
Why are you being weird?

1137
01:00:36,105 --> 01:00:38,370
我想我可能被什么东西咬了。
I think maybe I just got bit by something.

1138
01:00:38,506 --> 01:00:39,506
真的吗?
Really?

1139
01:00:39,611 --> 01:00:40,908
哦,一条蛇。
Oh, a snake.

1140
01:00:42,948 --> 01:00:45,049
哦……哦，那不好。
Oh... oh, that's no good.

1141
01:00:45,184 --> 01:00:46,944
哦,狗屎。
Oh, shit.

1142
01:00:47,080 --> 01:00:48,251
哦。哦,我的上帝。
Oh. Oh, my God.

1143
01:00:48,387 --> 01:00:49,816
哦,我的上帝。
Oh, my God.

1144
01:00:49,952 --> 01:00:51,314
——它是湿的。-在哪里?
- It's wet. - Uh, where is it?

1145
01:00:51,450 --> 01:00:54,415
我的天啊，在那儿!嗯，我们该怎么办?
Oh, my God, there it is! Um, what do we do?

1146
01:00:54,551 --> 01:00:56,031
-我们该怎么办?嗯…——做点什么。
- What do we do? Uh... - Do something.

1147
01:00:56,085 --> 01:01:01,226
好的。嗯…——任何东西。——嗯…好的。
Okay. Um... - Anything. - Uh... Okay.

1148
01:01:08,031 --> 01:01:09,470
你真了不起。
You're amazing.

1149
01:01:09,605 --> 01:01:13,508
我认为……我想我已经拿到大部分了。
I think... I think I got most of it.

1150
01:01:13,644 --> 01:01:15,713
我想我已经拿到大部分了。
I think I got most of it.

1151
01:01:17,077 --> 01:01:25,754
我刚给他吃的药会让他四肢发麻还有点头晕，但不会持久。
Well, he will experience some numbness in his extremities and a little wooziness from the pills I just gave him, but no lasting effect.

1152
01:01:25,890 --> 01:01:27,355
不像被海豚咬了。
Not like getting bit by a dolphin.

1153
01:01:27,490 --> 01:01:28,522
好吧。
All right.

1154
01:01:28,657 --> 01:01:31,084
你救了我的命。
You saved my life.

1155
01:01:31,219 --> 01:01:33,597
我真的没有。
I really didn't.

1156
01:01:33,733 --> 01:01:36,192
我们刚刚听到。什么是冒险。
We just heard. What an adventure.

1157
01:01:36,327 --> 01:01:37,863
你还好吗?我很好。
Are you okay? I'm okay.

1158
01:01:37,998 --> 01:01:39,865
多亏了我的勇士女王。
Thanks to my warrior queen.

1159
01:01:40,001 --> 01:01:42,267
——我的格鲁吉亚。——好的。
- My Georgia. - Okay.

1160
01:01:49,441 --> 01:01:51,377
-你在说什么?——嗯?
- What are you talking about? - Hmm?

1161
01:01:51,513 --> 01:01:53,382
蛇。
Snakes.

1162
01:01:53,517 --> 01:01:54,617
嗯。
Hmm.

1163
01:01:54,752 --> 01:01:56,149
我们应该让他睡觉。
We should let him sleep.

1164
01:01:56,284 --> 01:01:58,712
他会好起来的，但别再那么做了。
He's going to be fine, but don't do that again.

1165
01:01:58,848 --> 01:02:00,457
好的。大卫让的车子走了。
All right. DAVID andLet's go.

1166
01:02:00,592 --> 01:02:02,351
-是的。——哦。好的。-好的。
- Yeah. - Oh. Okay. -Okay.

1167
01:02:02,487 --> 01:02:04,321
我们会让你休息的，好吗?
We'll let you get some rest, okay?

1168
01:02:04,457 --> 01:02:05,937
但是别担心。我就呆在这儿。
But don't worry. I'll stay right here.

1169
01:02:06,027 --> 01:02:09,310
你还记得我问你的那个重要问题吗?
Oh, oh, oh, you remember that important thing that I asked you?

1170
01:02:09,368 --> 01:02:11,466
哦,是的。是的。
Oh, yeah. Yep.

1171
01:02:11,601 --> 01:02:13,302
他问你什么了?
What'd he ask you?

1172
01:02:13,438 --> 01:02:15,333
嫁给他。
To marry him.

1173
01:02:17,170 --> 01:02:19,232
——太棒了!——什么?
- That's wonderful! - What?

1174
01:02:19,368 --> 01:02:21,339
也许并不适合所有人。
Maybe not for everybody.

1175
01:02:21,475 --> 01:02:24,641
抱歉，我知道他人很好，但是…友善有什么不好?
Sorry, I get that he's nice and all, but... What's wrong with nice?

1176
01:02:25,644 --> 01:02:29,850
只是再过几年，你就得求着看油漆干了。
Uh, only that after a couple more years of it, you'll be begging to watch paint dry.

1177
01:02:29,985 --> 01:02:37,993
——请问?-我是说，妈妈，你很了不起，很有教养，很坚强，很聪明，很漂亮，但是你…和他在一起，你从来都不是最好的自己。
- Excuse me? - I mean, Mom, you're-you're so amazing and educated, tough, smart and beautiful, but you're... you're never your best self with him.

1178
01:02:38,128 --> 01:02:43,801
但是，他很善良，他有一双好眼睛，但这还不够。
But yeah, he's kind and he's got those eyes, but it's not enough.

1179
01:02:45,696 --> 01:02:48,366
被爱和爱不一样。
Being loved is not the same as loving.

1180
01:02:49,833 --> 01:02:53,207
还有，那件令人惊讶的事?
Plus, the who-whole surprising thing?

1181
01:02:54,210 --> 01:02:58,178
其实我们之间就隔着一道帘子，所以我都听到了。
It's actually just a curtain between us, so I heard all of that.

1182
01:03:17,897 --> 01:03:19,903
我感觉很糟糕。
I feel bad.

1183
01:03:21,004 --> 01:03:23,764
她没说她答应了。
Well, she didn't say she said yes.

1184
01:03:26,008 --> 01:03:27,878
如果她这么做了，你会怎么想?
How would you feel if she did?

1185
01:03:29,511 --> 01:03:33,946
就像听说一个几乎不怎么联系的老朋友要结婚了。
Like hearing an old friend you barely talk to anymore is getting married.

1186
01:03:34,082 --> 01:03:38,581
你为他们感到高兴，但是…你觉得没必要买礼物。
You're happy for them, but... you don't feel the need to buy a gift.

1187
01:03:40,222 --> 01:03:42,893
你们什么时候成了老朋友了?
Since when were you guys old friends?

1188
01:03:44,626 --> 01:03:46,121
啊。
Ah.

1189
01:03:46,257 --> 01:03:47,759
事情就是这样。
That's the way it goes.

1190
01:03:47,894 --> 01:03:52,870
事情发生…事情会改变，你会继续前进。
Stuff happens... things change, and you move on.

1191
01:03:56,607 --> 01:03:58,568
就继续前进。
Just move on.

1192
01:04:10,321 --> 01:04:12,417
她没资格告诉我该怎么做。
She doesn't get to tell me what to do.

1193
01:04:12,552 --> 01:04:14,453
你能相信吗?我很抱歉,宝贝。
Can you believe it? I'm sorry, baby.

1194
01:04:14,588 --> 01:04:17,287
我有点头晕。我应该相信吗?
I'm a little woozy. Am I supposed to believe it?

1195
01:04:17,422 --> 01:04:19,653
——没有。——没有。是的,我不能。
- No. - No. Right, I can't.

1196
01:04:19,789 --> 01:04:21,325
我知道你觉得我是个伪君子。
I know you're thinking I'm a hypocrite.

1197
01:04:21,460 --> 01:04:24,164
我是- - - ?-你可能是对的。
- Am I? - And you're probably right.

1198
01:04:24,299 --> 01:04:28,698
——哦。很好。-我们凭什么说莉莉不知道什么是对自己最好的?
- Oh. Good. - I mean, who are we to say that Lily doesn't know what's best for herself?

1199
01:04:28,833 --> 01:04:35,645
如果她真的这么做了，如果她真的确定她爱别人也被人爱，那么……哦，大卫和他们在一起。
And if she does, if she's truly definitively certain that she loves and is loved, then... Oh, David is with them.

1200
01:04:35,780 --> 01:04:37,275
大卫现在和格德和莉莉在一起。
David is with Gede and Lily now.

1201
01:04:37,410 --> 01:04:38,772
对，这样他就能拆散他们了。
Oh, right, so he can break them up.

1202
01:04:38,908 --> 01:04:40,715
不，我不想让他拆散他们。
No, I don't want him to break them up.

1203
01:04:40,850 --> 01:04:42,185
这该死的药。
Damn this medication.

1204
01:04:43,512 --> 01:04:45,047
我得做点什么。
I have to do something.

1205
01:04:45,182 --> 01:04:46,723
把这个。
Take this.

1206
01:04:46,858 --> 01:04:48,485
我很抱歉。
I'm sorry.

1207
01:04:48,620 --> 01:04:50,323
我很抱歉。这会帮助你入睡。
I'm sorry. This will help you sleep.

1208
01:04:51,754 --> 01:04:52,754
好的。酷。
All right. Cool.

1209
01:04:52,860 --> 01:04:54,295
感觉更好。
Feel better.

1210
01:04:54,430 --> 01:04:56,831
你知道，我是一名训练有素的商业飞行员。
You know, I'm a highly trained commercial pilot.

1211
01:04:56,967 --> 01:04:59,127
我可以几个星期不睡觉。
I can go weeks without sleep.

1212
01:05:16,712 --> 01:05:18,415
地球上最好的地方。
The best place on Earth.

1213
01:05:18,551 --> 01:05:22,584
GEDE:嗯，说句公道话，我并没有去过所有其他的地方。
GEDE Well, to be fair, I haven't been to all the other places.

1214
01:05:22,719 --> 01:05:24,853
你妈妈会嫉妒死的。
Your mother's gonna be so jealous.

1215
01:05:24,988 --> 01:05:27,530
一有信号我就给她发照片。
I'll send her a picture as soon as I get a signal.

1216
01:05:27,665 --> 01:05:29,329
没有必要。
No need.

1217
01:05:36,238 --> 01:05:38,775
妈妈。嘿。
Mom. Hey.

1218
01:05:38,910 --> 01:05:40,435
之前的事我很抱歉。
Hey, I'm so sorry about before.

1219
01:05:40,571 --> 01:05:42,507
我想我只是很惊讶。
I guess I was just surprised.

1220
01:05:42,642 --> 01:05:44,243
当然，你的选择是你的选择。
Of course your choices are your choices.

1221
01:05:44,379 --> 01:05:47,314
我还没做任何选择呢。
Well, I haven't made any choices yet.

1222
01:05:49,047 --> 01:05:50,111
哦。
Oh.

1223
01:05:50,246 --> 01:05:51,415
好的。
Okay.

1224
01:05:51,551 --> 01:05:52,551
嗨,绅士。
Hi, gents. Mm.

1225
01:05:52,580 --> 01:05:54,457
保罗还好吗?
Is, uh, Paul okay?

1226
01:05:54,593 --> 01:05:55,723
他睡觉。
He's sleeping.

1227
01:05:55,858 --> 01:05:57,384
你怎么知道?
How can you tell?

1228
01:05:57,520 --> 01:05:59,557
天啊，看看这风景。
God, look at this view.

1229
01:06:00,931 --> 01:06:02,725
莉莉是的。
LILY Yeah.

1230
01:06:04,866 --> 01:06:06,729
那是我的船吗?
Is that my boat?

1231
01:06:08,499 --> 01:06:10,535
漂流吗?
Is it drifting?

1232
01:06:11,538 --> 01:06:13,235
不，只是随波逐流而已。
Nah, it's just rising with the tide.

1233
01:06:13,371 --> 01:06:14,704
这是浮动的。
It's floating away.

1234
01:06:14,840 --> 01:06:16,744
-你把我的船系好了?-是啊，我系的。
- You did tie my boat off? - Yeah, I tied it.

1235
01:06:16,879 --> 01:06:18,873
把它绑在一根木头上。
Tied it to a log.

1236
01:06:21,850 --> 01:06:23,779
那不是很好。
That's not good.

1237
01:06:28,557 --> 01:06:30,423
我们离最近的村庄有多远?
How far are we from the nearest village?

1238
01:06:30,558 --> 01:06:33,392
太远了，走不动。另外，天快黑了。
Too far to walk. Plus, it's getting dark.

1239
01:06:33,527 --> 01:06:35,458
我还是收不到信号。
I still can't get a signal.

1240
01:06:35,594 --> 01:06:37,262
我们该怎么办?
What are we gonna do?

1241
01:06:37,397 --> 01:06:38,827
今晚在这里宿营。
Camp here for the night.

1242
01:06:38,962 --> 01:06:43,301
很多人来看日出，所以我们可以赶上我们的婚礼。
A lot of people come to see the sunrise, so we can get a ride in time for our wedding.

1243
01:06:43,436 --> 01:06:44,732
能行吗?
Is that gonna work?

1244
01:06:44,868 --> 01:06:47,066
是啊，还有好几个小时呢。
Yeah, with hours to spare.

1245
01:06:47,202 --> 01:06:49,446
乔治娅，你能和莉莉生个火吗?
Uh, Georgia, can you and Lily build a fire?

1246
01:06:49,581 --> 01:06:51,137
嗯，在，是的。
Uh, on it, yeah.

1247
01:06:51,272 --> 01:06:53,979
科顿先生，你和我去找点吃的。
Mr. Cotton, you and I will track down some food.

1248
01:06:54,115 --> 01:06:55,510
嗯。什么样的食物?
Hmm. What kind of food?

1249
01:06:55,645 --> 01:06:57,681
我在附近见过一些野猪。
I've seen some wild pigs around.

1250
01:06:58,985 --> 01:07:00,781
我们得做矛。
We'll have to make spears.

1251
01:07:00,917 --> 01:07:02,816
嗯。
Hmm.

1252
01:07:02,952 --> 01:07:05,291
什么?我可以打猎。我可以成为一个猎人。
What? I can hunt. I can be a hunter.

1253
01:07:05,427 --> 01:07:08,428
如何让这部分更尖?
How do you make that part pointier?

1254
01:07:09,795 --> 01:07:11,661
我对这种情况印象深刻……是的。
I am impressed with this situation... Yeah.

1255
01:07:11,796 --> 01:07:13,460
我包里还有火柴。
And I have, uh, matches in my bag.

1256
01:07:13,596 --> 01:07:15,128
好的。
Okay.

1257
01:07:15,263 --> 01:07:18,194
你知道吗，我觉得我以前从来没有成功生火过。
You know, I don't think I've actually successfully started a fire before.

1258
01:07:18,302 --> 01:07:19,933
哦,真的吗?
Oh, really?

1259
01:07:20,068 --> 01:07:21,671
那你八岁生日呢?
What about your eighth birthday, hmm?

1260
01:07:21,806 --> 01:07:24,376
哦，好吧，不是故意的。
Oh, well, never on purpose.

1261
01:07:24,512 --> 01:07:26,543
哦,上帝。我们有一些很好的聚会。
Oh, God. We had some good parties.

1262
01:07:26,679 --> 01:07:28,217
你还记得你十岁生日吗?
Do you remember your tenth birthday?

1263
01:07:28,353 --> 01:07:29,989
妈妈?-小丑来了，他喝醉了?
Mom? -And the clown came and he was drunk?

1264
01:07:30,013 --> 01:07:32,848
不，他是个魔法师，但他是…妈妈。
No, he was a magician, but he was... Mom.

1265
01:07:47,670 --> 01:07:50,073
大卫好了。你是最接近的。
DAVID All right. You're the closest.

1266
01:07:50,209 --> 01:07:53,006
我觉得它离你比离我近。
I think it's closer to you than me.

1267
01:07:53,142 --> 01:07:54,639
好的。嘿。
Okay. Hey.

1268
01:07:55,637 --> 01:07:58,579
在我的计算。好吗?
On my count. Okay?

1269
01:07:58,715 --> 01:08:00,447
一个。
One.

1270
01:08:02,378 --> 01:08:03,579
三。
Three.

1271
01:08:03,714 --> 01:08:05,588
爸爸!
Dad!

1272
01:08:07,215 --> 01:08:09,583
你在做什么?我们绝对做到了。
What are you doing? We absolutely had it.

1273
01:08:09,718 --> 01:08:11,324
我真不敢相信你。
I cannot believe you.

1274
01:08:11,460 --> 01:08:12,820
是你把它吓跑的。
You're the one that scared it away.

1275
01:08:12,856 --> 01:08:14,396
我说的不是这个。
That is not what I'm talking about.

1276
01:08:14,532 --> 01:08:16,828
-你在说什么?-她找到戒指了
- What are you talking about? - She found the rings.

1277
01:08:16,964 --> 01:08:18,100
真的吗?
Really?

1278
01:08:18,236 --> 01:08:19,096
太好了。在哪里?
That's great. Where?

1279
01:08:19,232 --> 01:08:20,328
在妈妈的袋子里。
In Mom's bag.

1280
01:08:20,463 --> 01:08:21,768
我知道它。
I knew it.

1281
01:08:21,903 --> 01:08:23,540
什么?
What?

1282
01:08:23,675 --> 01:08:25,033
我知道它。
I knew it.

1283
01:08:25,169 --> 01:08:28,575
她显然不是一个人在工作，因为…——等等,什么?-你落在包里了?
And she obviously wasn't working alone, because... - Wait, what? - You left it in the bag?

1284
01:08:28,710 --> 01:08:30,381
等等,等等,等等。你知道是什么意思?
Wait, wait, wait. Wh-What do you mean, you knew?

1285
01:08:30,405 --> 01:08:32,019
我该拿他们怎么办?扔掉它。
What was I supposed to do with them? Throw it away.

1286
01:08:32,043 --> 01:08:33,558
在哪里?我很抱歉。我不能告诉你。
Where? -I'm sorry. I couldn't tell you.

1287
01:08:33,582 --> 01:08:35,780
垃圾桶里，海里，任何地方，就是…哦,我的上帝。
In the trash, in the ocean, anywhere but... Oh, my God.

1288
01:08:35,916 --> 01:08:37,528
你能不能别再提戒指了?
Can you just stop talking about the rings, please?

1289
01:08:37,552 --> 01:08:39,212
我真不敢相信会发生这种事。
I cannot believe that this is happening.

1290
01:08:39,347 --> 01:08:42,865
我自己的父母一直试图破坏我的婚礼，而我的fiancé知道这件事，却懒得告诉我。
My own parents have been trying to sabotage my wedding, and my fiancé knew about it and didn't bother to tell me.

1291
01:08:42,889 --> 01:08:43,971
我们只是想做对你最好的事。
We were just trying to do what's best for you.

1292
01:08:43,995 --> 01:08:47,428
是啊，但你根本不尊重我的意见。
Yeah, but you had no respect for my opinion of what that might be.

1293
01:08:49,265 --> 01:08:58,209
你就像所有的父母一样，表现得好像你给孩子的建议是为了他们好，但实际上你所做的只是在和年轻愚蠢的自己说话，试图改写过去
You're just like all parents, acting like you're giving your kid this great advice for their own good, but all you're really doing is talking to your young, dumb selves, trying to rewrite the past

1294
01:08:58,233 --> 01:09:00,135
而不是做你25年前做的事。
and not do whatever you did 25 years ago.

1295
01:09:00,271 --> 01:09:02,874
-那绝对不是真的。-那是百分之百正确的。
- That's absolutely not true. - That's a hundred percent true.

1296
01:09:04,044 --> 01:09:13,916
我无法告诉你我有多希望当时有人能理解我，阻止我犯下人生中最大的错误。
And I can't tell you how much I wish someone had been able to get through to me back then, stop me from making the greatest mistake of my life.

1297
01:09:16,954 --> 01:09:19,020
我是你这辈子最大的错误?
I'm the greatest mistake of your life?

1298
01:09:20,358 --> 01:09:22,430
不是你。我。
Not you. Me.

1299
01:09:23,691 --> 01:09:25,433
我的错误。
I'm the mistake.

1300
01:09:30,367 --> 01:09:31,967
嘿。
Hey.

1301
01:09:51,920 --> 01:09:53,626
你觉得我们跟丢她了吗?
Do you think we've lost her?

1302
01:09:56,165 --> 01:09:58,158
她很生气。
She's pretty pissed.

1303
01:10:01,462 --> 01:10:03,933
我会和她谈谈的。我会告诉她这是我的主意。
I'll talk to her. I'll tell her it was my idea.

1304
01:10:05,108 --> 01:10:06,971
是我说服你的。
I talked you into it.

1305
01:10:08,141 --> 01:10:11,413
如果我听了你的话，我们就不会这么做了。
And if I'd listened to you, we wouldn't have done it.

1306
01:10:13,609 --> 01:10:15,483
她会没事的。
She'll be fine.

1307
01:10:21,124 --> 01:10:22,589
你不是一个错误。
You weren't a mistake.

1308
01:10:25,324 --> 01:10:26,791
你不是。
You weren't.

1309
01:10:28,425 --> 01:10:30,504
这么多年来大家都说你是罪魁祸首。
It's been the story for years that you were the one to blame.

1310
01:10:30,528 --> 01:10:32,698
这不是真的。
It's not true.

1311
01:10:35,531 --> 01:10:40,871
我…喜欢做妈妈。
I... was loving being a mom.

1312
01:10:43,143 --> 01:10:56,051
但我……开始觉得我失去了自我，我想…如果我和你在一起，也许有一天我会…完全认不出我自己。
But I... started to feel like I was losing who I was, and I thought... if I stayed with you, maybe one day I would... not recognize myself at all.

1313
01:11:00,493 --> 01:11:02,928
这是一个错误。
That was the mistake.

1314
01:11:03,064 --> 01:11:04,261
不是你。
Not you.

1315
01:11:16,380 --> 01:11:18,539
你应该告诉我的。
You should've told me.

1316
01:11:20,477 --> 01:11:23,353
你爸爸觉得你配得上比我更好的人。
Well, your dad thinks you deserve better than me.

1317
01:11:23,488 --> 01:11:26,182
我爸觉得我比谁都配得上。
My dad thinks I deserve better than anyone.

1318
01:11:26,318 --> 01:11:28,050
我也一样。
So do I.

1319
01:11:30,858 --> 01:11:34,364
你为了留在这个岛上放弃了很多。
You gave up a lot to stay on this island.

1320
01:11:35,530 --> 01:11:37,763
你知道我能理解。
And you know I understand that.

1321
01:11:39,597 --> 01:11:41,536
那我呢?
But what about me?

1322
01:11:42,705 --> 01:11:50,039
一年以后，十年以后……我对你来说还足够吗?
In a year from now, ten years from now... will I still be enough for you?

1323
01:11:52,116 --> 01:11:54,043
你在开玩笑吗?
Are you kidding me?

1324
01:11:55,748 --> 01:12:01,448
嘿，我们坐在这里，这里有月亮和瀑布。
Hey, we're sitting here, and there's a moon and a waterfall.

1325
01:12:01,584 --> 01:12:06,121
我在这辈子最美丽的地方，而我能看到的只有你。
I'm in the most beautiful place I've ever been in my life, and all I can look at is you.

1326
01:12:09,368 --> 01:12:13,568
这不是什么有开始有结束的夏天的事。
This isn't some summer thing with a beginning and an end.

1327
01:12:15,764 --> 01:12:17,565
这是永远的。
This is forever.

1328
01:12:48,831 --> 01:12:50,167
早....
Morning.

1329
01:12:50,303 --> 01:12:51,535
早....
Morning.

1330
01:12:51,671 --> 01:12:53,374
你怎么睡觉?
How'd you sleep?

1331
01:12:53,509 --> 01:12:55,973
你知道的,在外面。
You know, outside.

1332
01:12:58,013 --> 01:13:00,477
我想这是我在地球上最喜欢的新地方。
I think this is my new favorite place on Earth.

1333
01:13:02,650 --> 01:13:04,685
-我排第二。——是吗?
- Close second for me. - Yeah?

1334
01:13:05,683 --> 01:13:07,888
什么能打败它?
What beats it?

1335
01:13:09,985 --> 01:13:11,356
我们在湖边的房子。
Our place by the lake.

1336
01:13:11,492 --> 01:13:12,790
-是的。-是的。
- Yeah. - Yeah.

1337
01:13:12,925 --> 01:13:15,063
我还是时不时去那里。
I still go there from time to time.

1338
01:13:15,198 --> 01:13:16,397
——真的吗?——嗯。
- Really? - Mm-hmm.

1339
01:13:16,532 --> 01:13:17,994
天啊，他们在那里建了什么?
God, what did they build there?

1340
01:13:18,129 --> 01:13:20,498
请不要说什么可怕的豪宅。
Please don't say some hideous McMansion.

1341
01:13:20,633 --> 01:13:22,570
没有，还空着。
No, it's still vacant.

1342
01:13:22,706 --> 01:13:25,640
嗯。我想知道为什么没有人开发它。
Huh. I wonder why nobody ever developed it.

1343
01:13:27,442 --> 01:13:29,479
因为它还是我的。
'Cause I still own it.

1344
01:13:33,349 --> 01:13:35,915
我想把它卖了。
I meant to sell it.

1345
01:13:36,050 --> 01:13:38,785
接受过一次邀请，但我做不到。我只是…
Took an offer once, but I couldn't do it. I just...

1346
01:13:40,883 --> 01:13:42,690
我不想这么做。
I didn't want to.

1347
01:13:49,058 --> 01:13:50,923
你有一个…嗯,是的。
You-you got a... Mm, yeah.

1348
01:13:51,058 --> 01:13:53,129
整个森林。
An entire forest.

1349
01:14:19,396 --> 01:14:20,725
哦,不。
Oh, no.

1350
01:14:20,860 --> 01:14:23,091
——不,不。不。——不,不。
- No, no. No. - No, no.

1351
01:14:23,227 --> 01:14:24,930
,就…哦!——不。不,不。
- Just... Oh! - Nope. No, no.

1352
01:14:25,065 --> 01:14:26,580
-是啊，那可不行。——这是坏的。
- Oh, yeah, that would not work. - That's bad.

1353
01:14:26,604 --> 01:14:28,099
这行不通的。
That's not gonna work.

1354
01:14:28,234 --> 01:14:32,145
因为我们在一个浪漫的地方…不，是莉莉的事…-一切都被强化了。-是的。
It's because we're in this romantic place and... No, it's the whole thing with Lily... - everything is heightened. - Yeah.

1355
01:14:32,169 --> 01:14:35,040
我是说，如果我们年轻点…——我们不是。-我们不是。
I mean, maybe if we were younger... - We're not. - Uh, which we're not.

1356
01:14:35,176 --> 01:14:36,414
我们知道更好。我们知道更好。很好，很好，很好。
We know better. We know better. So, good, good, good.

1357
01:14:36,438 --> 01:14:37,877
我们可以做得更好。很好。很好。太好了。
We can do better. Good. Good. Great.

1358
01:14:38,013 --> 01:14:39,683
-好极了。-好极了。你知道吗?
- Good and great. - Good and great. You know what?

1359
01:14:39,707 --> 01:14:41,522
-嗨。嘿,嘿,嘿。-好极了。嘿,嘿,嘿。
- Hey. Hey, hey, hey. - Good and great. Hey, hey, hey.

1360
01:14:41,546 --> 01:14:42,727
把你的手给我。把你的手给我。什么?哦。
Give me your hand. Give me your hand. What? Oh.

1361
01:14:42,751 --> 01:14:43,615
——好的。-就这样。好的。
- Okay. - Just like that. Okay.

1362
01:14:43,751 --> 01:14:44,783
妈妈。爸爸。哦!是吗?
Mom. Dad. Oh! Yes?

1363
01:14:44,918 --> 01:14:45,548
-嗨。你好。-我们是你的父母。
- Hey. Hi. - We're your parents.

1364
01:14:45,684 --> 01:14:47,524
我们骑了。
We got rides.

1365
01:14:48,591 --> 01:14:51,126
好,好,好。你好了。
Well, well, well. Hello again.

1366
01:14:51,262 --> 01:14:53,325
或者我该说“再见”?
Or should I say, "Ciao"?

1367
01:15:04,472 --> 01:15:07,405
♪哦，宝贝♪
♪ Oh, babe ♪

1368
01:15:09,103 --> 01:15:10,811
♪我爱你。♪
♪ I love you. ♪

1369
01:15:20,223 --> 01:15:22,182
谢谢。嘿。
Thanks. Hey.

1370
01:15:22,317 --> 01:15:24,591
格鲁吉亚,嘿。宝贝!
Georgia, hey. Baby!

1371
01:15:24,727 --> 01:15:27,023
我很担心。
I was so worried.

1372
01:15:27,159 --> 01:15:29,424
哦。我们很好。我们很好。
Oh. We're fine. We're fine.

1373
01:15:29,559 --> 01:15:31,667
我只需要世界上最长的浴缸。你好吗?
I just need the world's longest bath. How are you?

1374
01:15:31,802 --> 01:15:33,362
你说的好好睡一觉是对的。
You were right about getting some sleep.

1375
01:15:33,438 --> 01:15:35,034
我的两条腿几乎都能动了。
I can almost move both my legs.

1376
01:15:35,169 --> 01:15:37,237
看，只有一只手臂在工作。
And look, one functioning arm.

1377
01:15:38,240 --> 01:15:42,168
-你们去哪了?-说来话长。这是……我们的船漂向大海。
- Where have you guys been? - It's a long story. It's... Our boat drifted out to sea.

1378
01:15:42,303 --> 01:15:44,638
这故事并不长。
That's not that long of a story.

1379
01:15:44,773 --> 01:15:46,973
是啊，如果你在场，那就说来话长了。
Yeah, well, it felt like a long story if you were there.

1380
01:15:47,014 --> 01:15:48,482
-嗨。你要去哪里?——莉莉。
- Hey. Where are you going? - Lily.

1381
01:15:48,617 --> 01:15:53,018
去任的房间准备，因为今天下午，我就要结婚了。
To Wren's room to get ready, because this afternoon, I'm getting married.

1382
01:15:54,318 --> 01:15:58,358
你要么同意，要么一路顺风回家。
You can either get on board with that or have a nice flight home.

1383
01:15:58,494 --> 01:16:00,157
莉莉。
Lily.

1384
01:16:24,385 --> 01:16:26,245
嘿。
Hey.

1385
01:16:26,381 --> 01:16:28,724
-你的燕尾服，先生-哦
- Your tuxedo, sir. - Oh.

1386
01:16:33,130 --> 01:16:34,323
在那里。
There.

1387
01:16:35,332 --> 01:16:36,394
你没事吧，先生?
Are you okay, sir?

1388
01:16:36,529 --> 01:16:37,697
是的。
Yeah.

1389
01:16:37,832 --> 01:16:39,702
一切显然都很棒。
Everything is clearly terrific.

1390
01:16:54,982 --> 01:16:56,681
惊喜!
Surprise!

1391
01:16:56,816 --> 01:16:57,848
你为什么要这么做?
Why would you do that?

1392
01:16:57,983 --> 01:16:59,215
-我买了早午餐——好的。
- I got us brunch. - Okay.

1393
01:16:59,350 --> 01:17:01,453
你在外面多久了?
How long have you been out here?

1394
01:17:01,588 --> 01:17:02,692
哦，没那么久。
Oh, not so long.

1395
01:17:03,691 --> 01:17:05,426
哦。哦，冷吗?
Oh. Oh, is it cold?

1396
01:17:05,562 --> 01:17:08,688
我不知道怎么…你会在浴缸里泡多久。
Oh, I-I wasn't sure how... how long you would stay in the bath.

1397
01:17:08,823 --> 01:17:11,228
现钞。我一整天都会恐慌症发作的。
Oof. I'm gonna be having that panic attack all day.

1398
01:17:11,364 --> 01:17:14,462
哦，哦，吃点东西。吃somethi……好吧，也许不是鸡蛋。
Oh, oh, eat something. Eat somethi... Well, maybe not the eggs.

1399
01:17:14,597 --> 01:17:18,602
它们有点凝固了。但首先……什么?
They're a little congealed. But first... What?

1400
01:17:18,737 --> 01:17:20,440
哦。
Oh.

1401
01:17:20,576 --> 01:17:22,938
取两个。
Take two.

1402
01:17:23,074 --> 01:17:24,780
——格鲁吉亚。——是吗?
- Georgia. - Yes?

1403
01:17:26,384 --> 01:17:28,549
我爱你。
I-I love you.

1404
01:17:28,684 --> 01:17:33,316
你美丽又善良……好吧,我……这次你不用下跪了。
You are gorgeous and kind... Okay, I... You don't have to kneel this time.

1405
01:17:33,452 --> 01:17:36,988
-你要我站着吗?-是的，我知道。我…——哦!哦!——哦!哦,来吧!
- Oh, you want me to stand? - Yeah, I do. I... - Oh! Oh! - Oh! Oh, come on!

1406
01:17:37,124 --> 01:17:40,426
你还好吗?我年代……我去给你拿点冰块。
Are you okay? I'm s... I'm-I'm gonna get you some ice.

1407
01:17:40,562 --> 01:17:41,922
不,我很好。
No, I'm fine.

1408
01:17:42,057 --> 01:17:43,123
你真勇敢。
You're so brave.

1409
01:17:43,259 --> 01:17:44,498
神。
God.

1410
01:17:44,633 --> 01:17:47,235
天啊，好疼。
Oh, my God, it hurts.

1411
01:17:49,774 --> 01:17:50,971
莉莉停止哭泣。
LILY Stop crying.

1412
01:17:51,968 --> 01:17:53,908
我为什么要哭?
Why would I cry?

1413
01:17:54,044 --> 01:17:59,005
我又不是要失去一个基本上可以代替我整个糟糕家庭的人。
It's not like I'm losing someone who's basically a substitute for my entire terrible family.

1414
01:18:00,979 --> 01:18:03,119
我的睫毛膏可以吗?
Is my mascara okay?

1415
01:18:03,254 --> 01:18:05,121
对一个小丑来说。
Uh, for a clown.

1416
01:18:05,256 --> 01:18:07,119
让我帮助。
Let me help.

1417
01:18:08,792 --> 01:18:10,483
你还记得我们毕业的时候吗?
Do you remember when we graduated?

1418
01:18:10,619 --> 01:18:13,758
是的，因为那是两个月前的事了。
Yes, because it was two months ago.

1419
01:18:13,894 --> 01:18:15,197
哦。
Oh.

1420
01:18:17,597 --> 01:18:19,065
C夫人?
Mrs. C?

1421
01:18:20,102 --> 01:18:21,962
接下来就交给你了。
You're gonna have to take it from here.

1422
01:18:22,098 --> 01:18:24,070
我只是不能。
I just can't.

1423
01:18:29,642 --> 01:18:31,176
嗨。
Hi.

1424
01:18:32,183 --> 01:18:33,750
嗨。
Hi.

1425
01:18:41,192 --> 01:18:42,957
我可以吗?
May I?

1426
01:18:50,433 --> 01:18:52,769
你骗了我。
You lied to me.

1427
01:18:55,934 --> 01:18:57,701
我非常非常抱歉。
I'm so, so sorry.

1428
01:18:59,369 --> 01:19:05,705
事实证明，父母愿意为他们的孩子做世界上的任何事，除了让他们做自己。
It turns out a parent will do anything in the world for their kid except let them be exactly who they are.

1429
01:19:08,479 --> 01:19:10,853
你爸爸和我本来会不一样的。
Your dad and I were gonna be different.

1430
01:19:13,682 --> 01:19:15,825
我们本该过得更好的。
We were gonna be better than this.

1431
01:19:17,958 --> 01:19:20,060
我想做得更好。
I wanted to be better than this.

1432
01:19:25,801 --> 01:19:28,035
没有人比你更好了，妈妈。
There's no one better, Mom.

1433
01:19:30,208 --> 01:19:31,907
没有人。
No one.

1434
01:19:32,905 --> 01:19:34,976
是的,有。
Yes, there is.

1435
01:19:43,345 --> 01:19:45,679
哦,亲爱的。爱你。
Oh, sweetie. Love you.

1436
01:19:52,854 --> 01:19:54,626
你得为婚礼做准备了，是吧?
Got to get you ready for that wedding, huh?

1437
01:19:56,431 --> 01:19:59,330
你现在有点一团糟。我知道。
You're kind of a mess right now. I know.

1438
01:20:03,037 --> 01:20:04,801
你是一个烂摊子。你是我的混乱。
You're a mess. You're my mess.

1439
01:21:11,838 --> 01:21:14,602
你能相信我没带什么衣服去参加婚礼吗?
Can you believe I didn't bring anything to wear to a wedding?

1440
01:21:14,738 --> 01:21:16,770
婚礼本不应该举行的。
There wasn't supposed to be a wedding.

1441
01:21:18,177 --> 01:21:19,949
看起来不像租来的。
Doesn't look like a rental.

1442
01:21:21,411 --> 01:21:23,348
你打扮得很漂亮。
You clean up pretty good.

1443
01:21:30,352 --> 01:21:32,753
好的。
Okay.

1444
01:21:48,643 --> 01:21:50,974
哇。
Wow.

1445
01:21:51,109 --> 01:21:52,638
看看我们的女孩。
Look at our girl.

1446
01:21:52,773 --> 01:21:54,180
和自由!
And free!

1447
01:21:54,315 --> 01:21:57,982
如此年轻，如此自由，如此充满汗水。
So young, so free, so sweaty.

1448
01:21:58,118 --> 01:22:00,388
所以出汗。
So sweaty.

1449
01:22:00,523 --> 01:22:02,189
是的。
Yeah.

1450
01:23:23,607 --> 01:23:25,100
她是好的。
She is good.

1451
01:24:13,783 --> 01:24:18,355
现在是最后一部分——典礼。-非常感谢。
And now for the final part - of the ceremony. - Thank you so much.

1452
01:24:18,490 --> 01:24:30,667
格德会拿着刀刺穿露兜菊来表明他和莉莉准备好同居了。
Gede will take the knife and strike it through this pandanus to show he and Lily will be ready to live together.

1453
01:24:43,851 --> 01:24:45,011
嗯…
Uh...

1454
01:24:50,157 --> 01:24:52,722
Desa,卡拉,智利。
Desa, kala, patra.

1455
01:24:53,688 --> 01:24:58,860
天时地利人和。
Right place, right time, right circumstance.

1456
01:25:00,137 --> 01:25:02,666
抱歉，这三样我们都没有。
Sorry, but we don't have all three.

1457
01:25:04,666 --> 01:25:14,007
乔治娅，科顿先生，我们需要你的支持，你的祝福，但我们没有。
Georgia, Mr. Cotton, we needed your support, your blessing, and we don't have it.

1458
01:25:16,012 --> 01:25:26,360
当我把这把刀穿过这张垫子时，这是一种宣言，这首关于一个人的诗和我现在是一个家庭。
When I push this knife through this mat, it is a declaration that this poem of a person and me are now a family.

1459
01:25:27,660 --> 01:25:29,693
没有你我们不能成为一个家。
We can't be a family without you.

1460
01:25:31,825 --> 01:25:41,034
所以我求你，为了莉莉和我，否则我们就不结婚。
So I ask you, please, for Lily and me, or we will not marry.

1461
01:25:42,346 --> 01:25:44,708
你不先跟我商量一下吗?
You didn't want to run that by me first?

1462
01:25:50,615 --> 01:25:52,881
你也可以做困难的事。
You can do the hard stuff, too.

1463
01:25:58,024 --> 01:26:02,731
嗯…你不需要我们的祝福。
Um... You don't need our blessing.

1464
01:26:02,867 --> 01:26:04,733
我是说，你有。
I mean, you have it.

1465
01:26:04,868 --> 01:26:07,060
在这里,但是……
It's here, but...

1466
01:26:09,239 --> 01:26:11,603
你们俩只需要彼此。
All you two really need is each other.

1467
01:26:15,939 --> 01:26:29,185
如果你妈妈和我听了她糟糕的父母和我那些蠢朋友的话，莉莉就不会在这里了，我想我们都同意有了莉莉这个世界会更好。
If your mother and I had listened to her awful parents or my dumb-ass friends, then Lily wouldn't be here at all, and I think we can all agree that the world's a lot better place with Lily in it.

1468
01:26:29,320 --> 01:26:33,119
所以,嗯…
So, uh...

1469
01:26:35,228 --> 01:26:37,156
——是吗?——嗯。
- Yeah? - Mm-hmm.

1470
01:26:40,834 --> 01:26:42,997
我是说，你妈妈和我是站在你这边的。
I mean, your mother and I are on your side.

1471
01:26:43,972 --> 01:26:46,103
这两个你。
Both of you.

1472
01:26:46,238 --> 01:26:47,972
现在和永远。
Now and always.

1473
01:26:48,107 --> 01:26:49,905
是的。
Yeah.

1474
01:27:00,582 --> 01:27:02,687
好吗?
Shall we?

1475
01:27:09,364 --> 01:27:11,193
等待。
Wait.

1476
01:27:11,328 --> 01:27:12,796
什么?
What?

1477
01:27:14,537 --> 01:27:16,331
我只是在开玩笑。就去做吧。
I'm just kidding. Go for it.

1478
01:27:19,339 --> 01:27:21,475
这是我的女儿。
That's my daughter.

1479
01:27:44,064 --> 01:27:49,371
你觉得如果我们踢了椰子几次，事情会不一样吗?
Do you think if we'd kicked a coconut around a few times, things would have worked out differently for us?

1480
01:27:50,972 --> 01:27:53,666
我相信一些红白相间的绳子不会有什么坏处。
I'm sure some red and white string couldn't have hurt.

1481
01:27:58,740 --> 01:28:00,406
保罗提出的。
Paul proposed.

1482
01:28:00,542 --> 01:28:02,743
我知道。
I know.

1483
01:28:02,878 --> 01:28:05,354
今天早上，他又求婚了。
This morning, he-he re-proposed.

1484
01:28:06,913 --> 01:28:09,051
你说什么?
What did you say?

1485
01:28:09,187 --> 01:28:12,223
我问他要冰块，因为他用头撞了我。
I asked him for some ice because he headbutted me.

1486
01:28:12,358 --> 01:28:13,826
嗯。
Hmm.

1487
01:28:14,996 --> 01:28:17,524
很多男人在那个时候都想要一个吻。
A lot of guys would've gone in for a kiss at that point.

1488
01:28:19,333 --> 01:28:21,530
让我看看你的鼻子。
Let me see your nose.

1489
01:28:21,666 --> 01:28:23,735
——让我们看看。
- Let's see. - Mm.

1490
01:28:27,210 --> 01:28:29,004
我觉得你应该答应。
I think you should say yes.

1491
01:28:35,110 --> 01:28:37,177
-保罗是个好人。——嗯。
- Paul's a good guy. - Mm-hmm.

1492
01:28:38,521 --> 01:28:44,954
如果他能让你有我们幸福时的一半幸福……
And if he makes you half as happy as we were when we were happy...

1493
01:28:48,561 --> 01:28:50,630
那你应该答应。
then you should say yes.

1494
01:28:52,970 --> 01:28:54,700
我不知道。
I don't know.

1495
01:28:56,639 --> 01:28:59,135
也许我太老了，感觉不到年轻了。
Maybe I'm too old to feel young anymore.

1496
01:28:59,271 --> 01:29:04,941
我…我想我错过了重要的东西，现在已经太晚了。
I... think I missed something critical, and now it's too late.

1497
01:29:07,081 --> 01:29:11,717
嗯…在我看来，你看起来风华正茂。
Well... you look like you're in your prime to me.

1498
01:29:16,820 --> 01:29:18,658
即使你有个歪鼻子。
Even with that crooked nose.

1499
01:29:36,673 --> 01:29:38,744
-嗨。-嗨。
- Hi. - Hi.

1500
01:29:57,927 --> 01:30:00,366
你在外面做什么?
What are you doing out here?

1501
01:30:00,502 --> 01:30:03,202
看看这些垃圾。
Just looking at this garbage.

1502
01:30:03,338 --> 01:30:05,199
你管这叫日落?
You call that a sunset?

1503
01:30:20,882 --> 01:30:23,019
我属于这里。
I belong here.

1504
01:30:25,555 --> 01:30:27,287
我知道。
I know.

1505
01:30:37,802 --> 01:30:40,003
你愿意来和我跳舞吗?
Will you come and dance with me?

1506
01:30:46,216 --> 01:30:48,077
我们去跳舞吧。
Let's go dance.

1507
01:31:01,730 --> 01:31:04,698
哇。它是如此安静。
Wow. It's so quiet.

1508
01:31:07,535 --> 01:31:09,364
嗨。
Hi.

1509
01:31:09,500 --> 01:31:11,230
嗨。
Hi.

1510
01:31:11,365 --> 01:31:13,968
-我吵醒你了吗?——没有。
- Did I wake you? - No.

1511
01:31:14,103 --> 01:31:15,468
-我踢你了吗?-不不不。
- Was I kicking? - No, no, no.

1512
01:31:15,603 --> 01:31:17,150
-天啊，我在踢你。-不，你没有。
- Oh, my God, I was kicking. - No, you weren't.

1513
01:31:17,174 --> 01:31:19,410
——你不是。我是。——哦。好吧。
- You weren't. I was up. - Oh. All right.

1514
01:31:22,414 --> 01:31:26,388
嗯…渡轮今天下午才开。
Um... Well, the ferry is only leaving this afternoon.

1515
01:31:26,524 --> 01:31:28,447
我想我们可以去冲浪。
I guess we could go paddleboarding.

1516
01:31:30,953 --> 01:31:32,924
我不能嫁给你，保罗。
I can't marry you, Paul.

1517
01:31:35,522 --> 01:31:37,698
不一定非得是板冲浪。
It doesn't have to be paddleboarding.

1518
01:31:38,760 --> 01:31:40,402
哦。
Oh.

1519
01:31:40,537 --> 01:31:42,168
-我做错什么了吗?——没有。
- Did I do something wrong? - No.

1520
01:31:42,303 --> 01:31:50,271
没有,只是……它是错误的…时间，错误的地点，错误的女孩。
No, it's just... It's the wrong... time, wrong place, wrong girl.

1521
01:31:52,644 --> 01:31:54,440
我很抱歉。
I'm so sorry.

1522
01:31:59,916 --> 01:32:01,955
——我也是。
- Me, too. - Mm.

1523
01:32:02,958 --> 01:32:05,055
我不只是同意同意你的观点。
And I'm not just agreeing to agree with you.

1524
01:32:11,964 --> 01:32:13,998
我还是要去冲浪。
I'm still gonna go paddleboarding.

1525
01:32:26,112 --> 01:32:28,144
得到它!
Get it!

1526
01:32:29,646 --> 01:32:31,345
踢它!
Kick it!

1527
01:32:41,757 --> 01:32:43,027
哇!
Whoa!

1528
01:32:48,436 --> 01:32:50,003
踢它!
Kick it!

1529
01:32:50,139 --> 01:32:51,431
踢它。
Kick it.

1530
01:33:00,214 --> 01:33:02,413
抓住它!抓住它!抓住它!抓住它!
Hold it up! Hold it up! Hold it up! Hold it up!

1531
01:33:02,548 --> 01:33:03,877
不!
No!

1532
01:33:04,013 --> 01:33:06,913
来吧,更多。更多。
Come on, more. More.

1533
01:33:08,722 --> 01:33:10,316
哦,福吉!
Oh, fudge!

1534
01:33:10,451 --> 01:33:12,358
现在该走了……哦!
Now it's going. Now it's go... Oh!

1535
01:33:12,494 --> 01:33:15,389
它走了！
It's going! It's going!

1536
01:33:16,495 --> 01:33:18,161
哇!
Whoa!

1537
01:33:25,200 --> 01:33:26,675
保罗在哪?
Where's Paul?

1538
01:33:27,710 --> 01:33:29,672
他在最后一刻飞抵河内。
He had a last-minute hop to Hanoi.

1539
01:33:29,808 --> 01:33:31,537
他让我说再见。
Uh, he said to say bye.

1540
01:33:32,574 --> 01:33:35,041
我告诉他我不会成功的。
I told him it wasn't gonna work out for me.

1541
01:33:35,177 --> 01:33:38,386
对他来说。为了我和他。
For him. For m-me and him.

1542
01:33:38,521 --> 01:33:40,084
我说得比这更好。
I said it better than that.

1543
01:33:41,850 --> 01:33:43,388
哦,妈妈。
Oh, Mom.

1544
01:33:43,523 --> 01:33:45,253
我很抱歉。
I'm sorry.

1545
01:33:45,388 --> 01:33:47,425
能不能把重点放在我身上?
Can we make this a little more about me?

1546
01:33:48,858 --> 01:33:50,054
当然。
Of course.

1547
01:33:51,997 --> 01:33:54,593
没有你我该怎么办?
What am I gonna do without you?

1548
01:33:58,772 --> 01:34:01,071
我想把这些给你。
I want you to have these.

1549
01:34:01,206 --> 01:34:05,111
我不介意你结婚，但我太年轻太漂亮了，不适合当阿姨。
I was fine with you getting married, but I'm way too young and gorgeous to be an aunt.

1550
01:34:12,851 --> 01:34:14,419
-嗨。-嗨。
- Hey. - Hey.

1551
01:34:16,251 --> 01:34:17,693
好的。好吧,老兄。
All right. All right, kiddo.

1552
01:34:18,755 --> 01:34:20,025
好的。
Okay.

1553
01:34:21,023 --> 01:34:22,890
爸爸。
Dad.

1554
01:34:23,025 --> 01:34:25,360
哦,不。没有哭。
Oh, no. No crying.

1555
01:34:28,228 --> 01:34:30,365
好的。我爱你。
Okay. I love you.

1556
01:34:35,542 --> 01:34:37,372
我爱你。
And I love you.

1557
01:34:39,216 --> 01:34:40,881
好吧。
All right.

1558
01:34:44,752 --> 01:34:46,116
——好的。——再见。
- All right. - Bye.

1559
01:34:46,252 --> 01:34:48,482
-你照顾好自己。——你。
- You take care of yourself. - You, too.

1560
01:34:52,387 --> 01:34:55,225
我爱你。
Mm. I love you.

1561
01:35:02,099 --> 01:35:04,663
我超级爱你。
I super love you.

1562
01:35:38,804 --> 01:35:41,202
抱歉保罗。
Sorry about Paul.

1563
01:35:41,337 --> 01:35:43,167
-不，你不是。——不是。
- No, you're not. - Not really.

1564
01:35:47,608 --> 01:35:49,084
我会想她的。
I'm gonna miss her.

1565
01:35:49,219 --> 01:35:51,182
是的。
Yeah.

1566
01:35:53,216 --> 01:35:55,850
我知道她为什么喜欢这里了。
I see why she likes it here.

1567
01:35:55,985 --> 01:35:58,024
是的,这很好。
Yeah, it's good.

1568
01:35:59,324 --> 01:36:02,327
我可以在这里待上一段时间。
I could see spending some time here.

1569
01:36:02,463 --> 01:36:04,228
有一天。
Someday.

1570
01:36:14,338 --> 01:36:17,069
为什么要把好东西留到以后呢?
Why save the good stuff for later?

1571
01:36:17,204 --> 01:36:19,309
是的。
Yeah.

1572
01:36:32,856 --> 01:36:34,324
什么?
What?

1573
01:36:48,512 --> 01:36:50,377
——是吗?-是的。
- Yeah? - Yeah.

1574
01:37:24,475 --> 01:37:30,415
我不会让她把自己的生活浪费在一个住在世界上最美丽地方的超级帅哥身上。
I won't let her throw her life away on some insanely handsome guy who happens to live in the most beautiful place on Earth.

1575
01:37:30,551 --> 01:37:32,982
是的，我知道这听起来很奇怪，但我还是对的。
And yes, I do know how that sounds, but I'm still right.

1576
01:37:33,117 --> 01:37:34,520
削减。
Cut.

1577
01:37:34,656 --> 01:37:35,917
我们有行动。
We got action.

1578
01:37:36,052 --> 01:37:37,458
约翰,你准备好了吗?
John, you ready?

1579
01:37:37,594 --> 01:37:39,151
嘿，约翰准备好了。
Hey, John is ready.

1580
01:37:40,923 --> 01:37:44,458
♪流动的回忆，把你带回来
♪ Memories that flow, bringing you back again ♪

1581
01:37:44,593 --> 01:37:47,096
♪伤害我越来越深…♪
♪ Hurting me more and more... ♪

1582
01:37:47,231 --> 01:37:48,699
阻止它。
Stop it.

1583
01:37:50,737 --> 01:37:52,598
我们有客人。
We have guests.

1584
01:37:52,733 --> 01:37:54,808
——大爱。——爱。爱你。
- Big love. - Love it. Love you.

1585
01:37:54,943 --> 01:37:56,645
——爱,爱。-我创造了你。
- Love, love. - I made you.

1586
01:37:56,780 --> 01:37:58,980
削减。
Cut.

1587
