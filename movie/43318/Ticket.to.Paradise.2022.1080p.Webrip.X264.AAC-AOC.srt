1
00:00:39,206 --> 00:00:40,624
<i>So you're asking her tonight?</i>

2
00:00:40,707 --> 00:00:42,709
Yeah. Any advice?

3
00:00:42,793 --> 00:00:46,004
Go for the grand gesture.
I used to do stuff like that all the time.

4
00:00:46,088 --> 00:00:49,049
He never did anything like that.
It was totally out of character.

5
00:00:49,132 --> 00:00:51,260
40,000. Do I have 45?

6
00:00:51,343 --> 00:00:52,636
- Actually…
- 45,000.

7
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:56,181
…David's proposal was probably
the only time he ever surprised me.

8
00:00:56,265 --> 00:00:58,308
We dated all four years
she was in college.

9
00:00:58,392 --> 00:01:00,894
I had a spot in the master's program
for architecture,

10
00:01:00,978 --> 00:01:02,980
so I was definitely staying in Chicago.

11
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:05,816
Then out of nowhere,
I get an offer from a great gallery in LA.

12
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:06,900
70,000?

13
00:01:06,984 --> 00:01:07,985
Seventy.

14
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:09,236
70,000.

15
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:10,821
So the night before graduation…

16
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:12,906
…and she springs it on me
she's leaving.

17
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:15,075
And I'm calm.
You know, happy for her.

18
00:01:15,158 --> 00:01:17,202
<i>He freaks out completely.</i>

19
00:01:18,245 --> 00:01:21,373
So, the next morning, the ceremony,

20
00:01:21,456 --> 00:01:24,501
I'm up there walking towards
the dean and my diploma,

21
00:01:24,585 --> 00:01:30,382
and suddenly, there's David,
right next to me, down on one knee.

22
00:01:31,008 --> 00:01:32,593
And she starts crying.

23
00:01:32,676 --> 00:01:34,428
I'm so embarrassed.

24
00:01:35,053 --> 00:01:37,848
The whole place erupts.
Everybody's clapping and shouting.

25
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:40,100
Except her parents.
They thought she was too young.

26
00:01:40,184 --> 00:01:42,144
- They thought I could do better.
- Going once.

27
00:01:42,227 --> 00:01:43,812
But who ever listens
to their parents?

28
00:01:43,896 --> 00:01:45,397
Sold to Georgia Cotton.

29
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:51,612
Long story short,
she didn't move to California,

30
00:01:51,695 --> 00:01:53,906
and a month later,
we were pregnant with Lily.

31
00:01:53,989 --> 00:01:56,575
That's amazing!
Wait, how long ago?

32
00:01:57,409 --> 00:01:59,536
Let me do the math.

33
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:02,581
March 7th, it'll be 25 years.

34
00:02:02,664 --> 00:02:04,708
Incredible. Twenty-five years of marriage.

35
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:07,002
Oh, God. We're not married.

36
00:02:07,085 --> 00:02:08,920
God, no.

37
00:02:09,003 --> 00:02:11,548
We divorced five years later.

38
00:02:11,632 --> 00:02:15,219
And it's not one of those
amicable divorces you see on TV.

39
00:02:15,302 --> 00:02:17,846
I try not to be in the same time zone
if I can help it.

40
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:20,057
But Lily's graduating tomorrow,
so here I am.

41
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,642
Wow, that's gotta be awkward.

42
00:02:21,725 --> 00:02:24,186
What? No. Ancient history.

43
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:26,438
Oh, yeah. Nightmare.

44
00:02:27,314 --> 00:02:28,482
Check, please.

45
00:02:32,945 --> 00:02:34,154
What are you doing?

46
00:02:35,239 --> 00:02:37,241
- I'm packing.
- You're packing work.

47
00:02:37,324 --> 00:02:40,077
Don't pack work.
Why would you pack work?

48
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,621
Because it's a short vacation
and a very long life afterwards.

49
00:02:42,704 --> 00:02:44,122
Yeah, I've been thinking about that,

50
00:02:44,206 --> 00:02:46,291
and I really don't think
this whole "being an adult" thing

51
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:48,836
is gonna work out for me.

52
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:51,463
Yeah, well,
I don't really have a choice.

53
00:02:52,381 --> 00:02:53,382
Hey, Mom.

54
00:02:53,465 --> 00:02:57,511
So I'm just steaming my outfit,
and I am wondering where I'm sitting.

55
00:02:58,095 --> 00:03:02,558
<i>Not that it matters. To me, I mean. Just...
I mean, it doesn't matter to me at all.</i>

56
00:03:02,641 --> 00:03:04,142
Then why did you...

57
00:03:04,226 --> 00:03:05,227
Oh, hang on. It's Dad.

58
00:03:06,854 --> 00:03:08,856
Hey, Dad. Mom's on the other line.

59
00:03:08,939 --> 00:03:10,858
Don't say hi from me.

60
00:03:10,941 --> 00:03:12,484
You're not sitting together,
okay?

61
00:03:12,568 --> 00:03:14,111
You're on opposite sides
of the auditorium,

62
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:15,612
which is the size of Rhode Island.

63
00:03:15,696 --> 00:03:17,239
That's the smallest state.

64
00:03:19,283 --> 00:03:24,288
So you promise? No mean comments,
no arguing, no passive aggression?

65
00:03:24,371 --> 00:03:26,874
What about aggressive
aggression? Is that okay?

66
00:03:26,957 --> 00:03:28,333
I love you.

67
00:03:28,417 --> 00:03:29,668
<i>I love you.</i>

68
00:03:30,627 --> 00:03:33,046
This is gonna be
an unbearable day.

69
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:36,925
Come on. We shake an old guy's hand
and wear a dumb hat.

70
00:03:37,009 --> 00:03:38,510
What could possibly go wrong?

71
00:03:39,845 --> 00:03:41,346
They're sitting together.

72
00:03:46,393 --> 00:03:47,394
Good afternoon.

73
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:49,229
Excuse me. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

74
00:03:49,313 --> 00:03:52,900
On behalf of the faculty
and staff of Pullman University…

75
00:03:52,983 --> 00:03:53,984
Big day.

76
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:58,488
…It is my privilege to welcome
the parents, family and friends

77
00:03:58,572 --> 00:04:00,157
of our graduating seniors.

78
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,950
You gotta be kidding me.

79
00:04:02,034 --> 00:04:05,871
Guess this is my seat, as you haven't
had a date since Lily was in braces.

80
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:08,081
At least when I do date,
it's age appropriate.

81
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:11,376
You just don't like him
because he's French.

82
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:14,755
I like the French. I like their fries.
Their toast. Their mustard.

83
00:04:14,838 --> 00:04:17,089
I specifically asked Lily
not to seat us together.

84
00:04:17,173 --> 00:04:18,466
You called her? That's so pathetic.

85
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:19,801
- Shh. It's starting.
- Don't shush me.

86
00:04:19,885 --> 00:04:21,720
- Shh.
- Don't shush me.

87
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:25,182
So, without further ado,
let's begin the roll call.

88
00:04:25,933 --> 00:04:28,227
Wren Butler.

89
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:29,311
Yes!

90
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:32,731
Wrenny!

91
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:39,905
Excuse me.
That's my armrest.

92
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:40,989
No, it's in the middle.

93
00:04:41,073 --> 00:04:45,577
- This is so like you. Take, take, take.
- It is not a metaphor. It is an armrest.

94
00:04:45,661 --> 00:04:48,497
- Give me half, please. I would like half.
- Just stop. Just stop.

95
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:51,708
Just give me half!
What is wrong with you?

96
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:53,335
- I just want half!
- Lily Cotton.

97
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,258
- Take a picture.
- You take a picture.

98
00:04:59,341 --> 00:05:01,009
- I'm in the moment.
- Why do you need a picture?

99
00:05:01,093 --> 00:05:02,886
- So I don't forget the moment.
- Ah…

100
00:05:03,595 --> 00:05:05,180
- Love you.
- Love you more.

101
00:05:05,264 --> 00:05:06,390
- So proud.
- Prouder.

102
00:05:06,473 --> 00:05:07,933
- The most proud.
- Proudest!

103
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:10,769
Couldn't be more proud. Bursting.

104
00:05:11,603 --> 00:05:13,897
- She got my nose. You're welcome, honey.
- Yeah.

105
00:05:13,981 --> 00:05:15,148
Love you, Lily.

106
00:05:16,942 --> 00:05:18,610
<i>I can't believe my baby's a lawyer.</i>

107
00:05:18,694 --> 00:05:20,362
You and me both.

108
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:22,948
- Can everyone please stop shouting?
- Who's shouting?

109
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:24,074
There you go again.

110
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:27,327
Some of us maybe had
seven too many Jägerbombs last night.

111
00:05:27,411 --> 00:05:30,497
Just one too many.
The other six were perfection.

112
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:34,626
Well, it's a long flight to Bali.
You can sleep on the plane.

113
00:05:36,086 --> 00:05:38,255
Lily can work on the plane.

114
00:05:38,922 --> 00:05:41,884
She had at least 90 hours
of exams in the last week.

115
00:05:41,967 --> 00:05:44,887
Well, in the next three months,
she starts at the top law firm in Chicago.

116
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:46,972
You can't show up at a gunfight
with a tan.

117
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:50,267
Okay, she needs to decompress,
and you need to calm down.

118
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:53,437
You know, telling someone to calm down
has literally never calmed anyone down

119
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,771
in the history of the universe.

120
00:05:54,855 --> 00:05:56,356
- I know that.
- You know that.

121
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,774
Inside voices, please.

122
00:05:57,858 --> 00:06:00,360
I'm taking briefs. I'm taking sunblock.
I'll be fine.

123
00:06:00,444 --> 00:06:02,654
You know, for once,
you could back me up.

124
00:06:02,738 --> 00:06:05,199
I could, but then I'd be wrong too.

125
00:06:05,282 --> 00:06:06,533
Okay, we should go.

126
00:06:06,617 --> 00:06:08,327
Do you see what you did?
You blew the goodbye.

127
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:09,411
- I did that.
- Uh-huh.

128
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:12,080
- It wasn't just him. Bye.
- I love you.

129
00:06:12,164 --> 00:06:13,248
See, it wasn't just me.

130
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:15,626
- Hey. Bye.
- Bye, Dad.

131
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:17,836
- Bye-bye-bye!
- Bye-bye-bye!

132
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:20,214
Bye, Lily's dad and mom…

133
00:06:20,297 --> 00:06:22,966
…'cause my dad and mom
don't even know I'm going.

134
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:25,928
I love you. Be safe!

135
00:06:26,011 --> 00:06:27,221
Make good choices.

136
00:06:27,304 --> 00:06:28,305
Always.

137
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:29,556
Rarely.

138
00:06:31,934 --> 00:06:32,935
And she's gone.

139
00:06:34,144 --> 00:06:35,687
See you again. Never.

140
00:06:35,771 --> 00:06:37,022
Hopefully not that soon.

I say we just move here.

152
00:07:21,984 --> 00:07:23,151
I'd need more sunblock.

153
00:07:24,194 --> 00:07:25,904
I say we think about it.

- Wait.

155

Where's the boat?

156
00:07:33,328 --> 00:07:35,789
Oh, shit. They forgot us.

157
00:07:35,873 --> 00:07:39,918
Uh, no, no, no. It's fine.
We're good swimmers.

158
00:07:40,836 --> 00:07:42,504
How far do you think that is?

159
00:07:43,255 --> 00:07:44,423
A mile?

160
00:07:45,007 --> 00:07:46,508
A hundred miles?

161
00:07:46,592 --> 00:07:47,759
Who can ever really tell?

162
00:07:47,843 --> 00:07:50,721
Okay. Uh, let's go. Come on!

163
00:07:51,889 --> 00:07:52,890
Okay.

164
00:07:55,225 --> 00:07:56,935
- Lily?
- What?

165
00:07:57,019 --> 00:07:59,688
If we don't make it,
I love you like a sister.

166
00:07:59,771 --> 00:08:01,565
Don't talk.
Conserve your energy.

167
00:08:01,648 --> 00:08:02,649
Okay.

168
00:08:04,067 --> 00:08:05,611
You hate your sister.

169
00:08:05,694 --> 00:08:06,695
Yeah.

170
00:08:06,778 --> 00:08:09,781
I love you like how a person
is supposed to love their sister,

171
00:08:09,865 --> 00:08:12,117
like, if their sister
wasn't a total bitch.

172
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:14,661
Hey!

173
00:08:14,745 --> 00:08:15,662
- Hey!
- Hey!

174
00:08:15,746 --> 00:08:17,414
- Over here! Help us!
- It's us! Hey!

175
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:18,790
- Come over here!
- Over here!

176
00:08:18,874 --> 00:08:20,501
- Hello? Hey!
- Help!

177
00:08:22,503 --> 00:08:24,463
See? It's gonna be okay.

178
00:08:26,673 --> 00:08:29,218
All I see is one
super hot boat guy.

179
00:08:36,475 --> 00:08:37,851
You're a long way out for a swim.

180
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:39,811
The boat forgot us.

181
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:42,813
How could they forget about you?

182
00:08:43,482 --> 00:08:45,108
That's what I'm saying.

183
00:08:46,985 --> 00:08:49,613
Careful. Gotcha. I gotcha.

184
00:08:51,281 --> 00:08:52,783
You okay?

185
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:53,867
Yeah.

186
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,121
I'm Lily.

187
00:08:59,665 --> 00:09:02,376
Well, pleased to meet you, Lily.
I'm Gede.

188
00:09:06,088 --> 00:09:07,089
Hello?

189
00:09:08,465 --> 00:09:09,925
A little help down here?

00:09:13,971 --> 00:09:15,347

195
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:32,364
So, what do you do
when you're not swimming for your life?

196
00:09:32,447 --> 00:09:33,824
I'm a lawyer.

197
00:09:34,449 --> 00:09:36,994
- I will be when I get home.
- Oh.

198
00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:38,787
- I just graduated from college.
- Here.

199
00:09:39,496 --> 00:09:40,497
That's exciting.

200
00:09:41,456 --> 00:09:42,791
You think?

201
00:09:42,875 --> 00:09:43,876
Don't you?

202
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:47,337
I don't know. I just...

203
00:09:47,421 --> 00:09:49,214
I mean, my whole life,
I've been working

204
00:09:49,298 --> 00:09:51,842
towards this, like,
far-off thing on the horizon.

205
00:09:51,925 --> 00:09:55,095
And now that
I've finally gotten there,

206
00:09:55,179 --> 00:10:00,058
I can't help but wonder
if I've had the plan wrong all along.

207
00:10:02,144 --> 00:10:04,521
I don't know. But it's... it's too late.

208
00:10:04,605 --> 00:10:06,732
You know, I can't not do it,
you know.

209
00:10:07,608 --> 00:10:09,401
I can't let everybody down.

210
00:10:09,484 --> 00:10:11,278
Who would you be letting down?

211
00:10:12,905 --> 00:10:16,074
Well, uh, my parents, for one.

212
00:10:17,701 --> 00:10:18,702
Who else?

213
00:10:20,537 --> 00:10:23,373
Uh, well, I guess just them.

214
00:10:24,124 --> 00:10:26,710
And what about you?
What's your story?

215
00:10:26,793 --> 00:10:27,920
I'm a seaweed farmer.

216
00:10:28,754 --> 00:10:30,547
What?

217
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:33,425
That's a sentence I haven't heard a lot.

218
00:10:33,509 --> 00:10:35,594
Well, you've been spending time
with the wrong people.

219
00:10:36,762 --> 00:10:40,265
My father was a seaweed farmer,
his father before him…

220
00:10:40,349 --> 00:10:45,145
And what about
his father before him?

221
00:10:45,229 --> 00:10:47,814
He was a fisherman.
They can't all be winners.

222
00:10:54,821 --> 00:10:56,406
Why are you looking at me like that?

223
00:10:58,784 --> 00:11:00,244
I'm sorry.

224
00:11:00,327 --> 00:11:01,328
I just, um...

225
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:03,872
I have this crazy...

226
00:11:05,207 --> 00:11:07,459
I just really wanna kiss you right now.

227
00:11:07,543 --> 00:11:11,046
But don't worry. I won't just, like,
you know, suddenly…

228
00:12:34,755 --> 00:12:36,298
- The water's warm.
- Oh.

229
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:38,800
Okay.

230
00:12:46,517 --> 00:12:48,185
You been out here for a while?

231
00:12:49,144 --> 00:12:50,812
The floor isn't that comfy.

232
00:12:56,318 --> 00:12:58,487
I wish I went to work in a bathing suit.

233
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:01,031
This isn't work.

234
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:05,577
It's a partnership. With Dewi Danu,
the goddess of the sea.

235
00:13:08,872 --> 00:13:12,376
All we have to do
is understand her tides and moods…

236
00:13:14,461 --> 00:13:18,090
Not throw plastic into her,
not over farm her,

237
00:13:18,882 --> 00:13:20,592
and she'll give us wonderful lives.

238
00:13:21,885 --> 00:13:23,387
Nature, God and people.

239
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:27,641
Balance the three, and you have harmony.

240
00:13:33,564 --> 00:13:35,399
I am so out of balance.

241
00:13:38,694 --> 00:13:39,945
You can find it here.

242
00:14:00,424 --> 00:14:02,092
{\an8}<i>It's a savage commentary</i>

243
00:14:02,176 --> 00:14:05,179
<i>on the illusion of freedom in our society.</i>

244
00:14:05,262 --> 00:14:09,433
But look closer and you'll divine
a fundamental compassion that...

245
00:14:09,516 --> 00:14:11,310
I think it's upside down.

246
00:14:12,394 --> 00:14:15,022
Really?

247
00:14:16,398 --> 00:14:17,649
Would you excuse me, please?

248
00:14:19,902 --> 00:14:21,862
I'm working, David.
I really don't have time.

249
00:14:21,945 --> 00:14:25,532
Unless you became an oncologist
since we last spoke, you got time.

250
00:14:25,616 --> 00:14:27,826
There you go,
always diminishing what I do.

251
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:30,495
What you do
diminishes what you do.

252
00:14:30,579 --> 00:14:32,831
- Check your email.
- <i>I do check it. You're blocked</i>.

253
00:14:32,915 --> 00:14:33,916
Lily wrote us.

254
00:14:33,999 --> 00:14:35,918
Whatever this is, it's your fault.

255
00:14:39,546 --> 00:14:40,839
She what?

256
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:44,426
Excuse me.

257
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:45,928
Thank you.

258
00:14:46,011 --> 00:14:50,557
<i>This is East Atlantic flight 576
with continuing service to Denpasar, Bali.</i>

259
00:14:50,641 --> 00:14:54,144
<i>Thanks for everyone's patience as we
welcome aboard our Los Angeles passengers.</i>

260
00:14:54,228 --> 00:14:55,521
Can I get you some champagne?

261
00:14:55,604 --> 00:14:57,189
- Mmm.
- Two, please.

262
00:14:58,232 --> 00:14:59,983
I only drink when I fly.

263
00:15:01,193 --> 00:15:03,278
I'm Beth-Ann Flannery.

264
00:15:03,362 --> 00:15:06,114
I like to befriend my seatmates
in case we crash,

265
00:15:06,198 --> 00:15:09,743
so they're more inclined to
pull me from the wreckage.

266
00:15:09,826 --> 00:15:14,289
I have two children and a dog...

267
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:18,043
Okay? Okay.

268
00:15:18,794 --> 00:15:21,046
Excuse me, ma'am.
I think your things are in my seat.

269
00:15:21,129 --> 00:15:22,256
Oh, sorry.

270
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:24,550
Oh, come on.

271
00:15:24,633 --> 00:15:26,093
You've gotta be kidding me.

272
00:15:26,885 --> 00:15:27,886
You speak English!

273
00:15:28,595 --> 00:15:30,556
You're still doing
the Italian tourist bit.

274
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:32,349
Excuse me, ma'am?

275
00:15:32,432 --> 00:15:34,101
I need to sit somewhere else.

276
00:15:34,184 --> 00:15:35,853
I'm sorry. It's a full flight.

277
00:15:35,936 --> 00:15:36,937
We used to be married.

278
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:38,397
The worst 19 years of my life.

279
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:41,024
- We were only married for five.
- I'm counting the recovery.

280
00:15:41,108 --> 00:15:42,401
I can't sit there.

281
00:15:42,484 --> 00:15:44,570
- There's nothing I can do.
- Wha...

282
00:15:45,737 --> 00:15:47,447
I'll swap with you, dear.

283
00:15:47,531 --> 00:15:49,950
- Just remember, in case we go down.
- Oh…

284
00:15:50,868 --> 00:15:52,536
You owe me one.

285
00:15:52,619 --> 00:15:54,538
- Thank you.
- I told you I was gonna go get her.

286
00:15:54,621 --> 00:15:55,622
In four days' time...

287
00:15:55,706 --> 00:15:59,376
Our daughter's going to marry a guy
she just met, millions of miles from home.

288
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:02,379
Excuse me, did the middle of my sentence
interrupt the beginning of yours?

289
00:16:02,462 --> 00:16:04,756
- She's throwing her career away.
- Just like her mother did.

290
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,508
Which is why I'm the only one
that can stop her.

291
00:16:06,592 --> 00:16:08,260
- She doesn't listen to him.
- She listens to me.

292
00:16:08,343 --> 00:16:10,679
- Oh, did she respond to your email?
- Yes.

293
00:16:10,762 --> 00:16:12,222
And there she is!

294
00:16:14,349 --> 00:16:15,893
Oh, my God. Paul!

295
00:16:15,976 --> 00:16:17,102
Paul?

296
00:16:17,186 --> 00:16:19,730
I know you love a surprise. I know you do.

297
00:16:19,813 --> 00:16:21,648
- Mmm.
- You!

298
00:16:22,316 --> 00:16:23,942
Looks like someone upgraded.

299
00:16:24,026 --> 00:16:25,152
She hates a surprise.

300
00:16:26,445 --> 00:16:28,071
David?
What are you doing here?

301
00:16:28,155 --> 00:16:30,199
I'm flying to Bali.
What are you doing here?

302
00:16:30,282 --> 00:16:31,658
I'm flying you to Bali.

303
00:16:32,326 --> 00:16:34,077
- I couldn't let her go alone…
- Ah.

304
00:16:34,161 --> 00:16:36,121
…so I traded flights with a friend.

305
00:16:36,205 --> 00:16:39,082
Gotta captain three long hauls
to Uruguay next month, but…

306
00:16:39,791 --> 00:16:41,418
The things you do for love, right?

307
00:16:41,502 --> 00:16:43,670
- It's so sweet.
- I know.

308
00:16:46,006 --> 00:16:47,841
- Mmm.
- So sweet.

309
00:16:48,342 --> 00:16:50,093
Mmm.

310
00:16:51,094 --> 00:16:53,388
Ah, <i>oui.</i> Me too.

311
00:17:02,022 --> 00:17:04,441
Oh, my. Those eyes.

312
00:17:04,525 --> 00:17:05,858
Couldn't you just swim in them?

313
00:17:05,943 --> 00:17:08,319
They're blue. Big deal.
So are my socks.

314
00:17:08,403 --> 00:17:10,821
And Frenchmen make such great lovers.

315
00:17:10,906 --> 00:17:12,950
That's a rumor
they started about themselves.

316
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:14,367
Oh, keep telling yourself that.

317
00:17:14,451 --> 00:17:16,244
Oh!

318
00:17:16,328 --> 00:17:17,329
Champagne!

319
00:17:17,412 --> 00:17:18,664
Oh, two, please.

320
00:17:18,747 --> 00:17:21,375
Just leave the bottle. Thank you.

321
00:17:24,169 --> 00:17:27,089
Baby, I don't think that him tagging along
on your trip is going to help.

322
00:17:27,172 --> 00:17:28,674
Well, that's a hot take.

323
00:17:28,757 --> 00:17:31,885
The last time David was actually helpful
was the night we made Lily.

324
00:17:31,969 --> 00:17:34,721
There's an image
I'm not crazy about.

325
00:17:34,805 --> 00:17:37,891
Mmm. You live. You learn.
You upgrade.

326
00:17:40,269 --> 00:17:42,813
Aren't you supposed to be
flying the plane, Paul?

327
00:17:42,896 --> 00:17:44,857
Or at least not making out
with the passengers?

328
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:47,651
Just this passenger.
The only one that counts.

329
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:51,738
It's a totally foreign concept to you,
but Paul puts me first.

330
00:17:51,822 --> 00:17:53,240
He supports everything I do.

331
00:17:53,323 --> 00:17:55,409
That's because
everything she does is perfect.

332
00:17:55,492 --> 00:17:56,660
He's exaggerating.

333
00:17:56,743 --> 00:17:57,744
Is he?

334
00:17:57,828 --> 00:17:59,204
- Are you?
- I'm really not.

335
00:17:59,288 --> 00:18:01,164
- Sure you are.
- If you say so.

336
00:18:03,667 --> 00:18:05,878
Okay, it's just a little turbulence.

337
00:18:05,961 --> 00:18:08,672
The plane is actually designed
to right itself in...

338
00:18:09,381 --> 00:18:10,591
Please go back to your seats.

339
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:19,099
That was my house. My garden. My house.

340
00:18:19,183 --> 00:18:21,351
Why do I have so many
pictures of my house?

341
00:18:21,435 --> 00:18:23,478
Oh! There's Charlie. He's my dog.

342
00:18:23,562 --> 00:18:26,190
Did I mention he's very old and unwell?

343
00:18:26,273 --> 00:18:28,901
- It's gonna be all right. Really.
- You're right. It's gonna be fine.

344
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:38,994
These things happen, of course,
you know.

345
00:18:39,077 --> 00:18:41,663
Pilots aren't magicians.
We only have so much control up there.

346
00:18:41,747 --> 00:18:43,498
Of course. People understand that.

347
00:18:43,582 --> 00:18:45,000
You're the fucking worst.

348
00:18:45,083 --> 00:18:47,503
Nice try killing us, asshole!

349
00:18:49,254 --> 00:18:51,423
Maybe you should go,
before they get out the pitchforks.

350
00:18:51,507 --> 00:18:53,759
- I'll see you when you get back here.
- Yeah.

351
00:18:54,259 --> 00:18:56,136
- Okay. I'll see you in four days.
- Yes.

352
00:19:02,267 --> 00:19:03,310
Don't blame yourself, Paul.

353
00:19:03,393 --> 00:19:06,146
It could happen to anybody
who doesn't know what they're doing.

354
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:07,523
Where's Lily?

355
00:19:07,606 --> 00:19:10,400
I thought you got her email.
She's meeting us off the boat.

356
00:19:11,818 --> 00:19:13,111
What?

357
00:19:29,044 --> 00:19:31,672
This is the most incredible place
I've ever seen.

358
00:19:31,755 --> 00:19:33,006
You know what's incredible?

359
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:36,343
- Hawaii. And it's in America.
- You've never been to Hawaii.

360
00:19:36,426 --> 00:19:38,679
- You don't know where I've been.
- You've never been to Hawaii.

361
00:19:38,762 --> 00:19:41,181
- Ah…
- Okay. Let's talk game plan.

362
00:19:41,849 --> 00:19:45,018
As much as this will pain us both,
we have to call a truce to make this work.

363
00:19:45,102 --> 00:19:46,436
Yes, we need to be in lockstep.

364
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:47,896
- No meanness.
- No arguing.

365
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:49,731
- We speak as one.
- Exactly right.

366
00:19:49,815 --> 00:19:51,942
- When do we start?
- Right after we see Lily.

367
00:19:54,069 --> 00:19:57,698
We tell her the wedding is off,
and we'll bring her home.

368
00:19:57,781 --> 00:20:00,868
Well, you know whenever we say
"don't" to Lily, she just hears "do."

369
00:20:00,951 --> 00:20:05,247
I say we go in
100% there for her in all ways.

370
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:07,958
Just supportive and loving.

371
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:10,669
And that's how we trick her into
dumping Mr. Seaweed.

372
00:20:10,752 --> 00:20:13,589
That's interesting. Now, I'm thinking
about a Trojan horse sort of thing.

373
00:20:13,672 --> 00:20:15,257
We make her think
we're okay with the wedding,

374
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:17,259
and then once we're in,
we get her to end it herself.

375
00:20:18,427 --> 00:20:19,928
That's literally what I just said.

376
00:20:21,221 --> 00:20:23,056
I don't remember
anything about a Trojan horse.

377
00:20:31,899 --> 00:20:33,066
Okay, so you got the plan?

378
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:34,818
Of course I got the plan.
It's my plan.

379
00:20:34,902 --> 00:20:35,986
Thanks, fellas.

380
00:20:37,362 --> 00:20:39,364
Hey.

381
00:20:40,949 --> 00:20:43,660
- Hey, guys! Hey, Dad.
- Hey. Hi.

382
00:20:43,744 --> 00:20:45,621
- Hi.
- Hi. Hey and hi.

383
00:20:46,496 --> 00:20:49,166
So, did you make a pact
to not murder each other

384
00:20:49,249 --> 00:20:50,334
until you murder me first?

385
00:20:50,417 --> 00:20:53,086
- Come on. Nobody is murdering anybody.
- No, no.

386
00:20:53,170 --> 00:20:55,130
I mean, of course,
we have some questions.

387
00:20:55,214 --> 00:20:57,883
We are your parents.
We are here for you, my love.

388
00:20:57,966 --> 00:20:59,510
- Yes, we're in lockstep.
- Yes. Right.

389
00:20:59,593 --> 00:21:01,929
I've been really freaked out
about what you guys were gonna say.

390
00:21:02,012 --> 00:21:04,932
Especially you, Dad. I mean, you had
a panic attack when I pierced my ears.

391
00:21:05,015 --> 00:21:06,725
- Yes.
- Well, it's just about hygiene.

392
00:21:06,808 --> 00:21:08,810
And I know how much
you wanted the lawyer thing. It just...

393
00:21:08,894 --> 00:21:11,396
- Well...
- We just... We want you to be happy, honey.

394
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:12,606
Yeah.

395
00:21:14,107 --> 00:21:17,736
Wow. Okay. That is such a relief.

396
00:21:17,819 --> 00:21:18,946
All right.

397
00:21:19,029 --> 00:21:20,113
Wow.

398
00:21:20,197 --> 00:21:22,407
- Oh, Wrenny, hi.
- Hey, Wren.

399
00:21:22,491 --> 00:21:25,244
- Don't mind me. Just here for backup.
- We're all good now.

400
00:21:25,327 --> 00:21:27,246
You guys are gonna love it here,
and you'll love Gede.

401
00:21:27,329 --> 00:21:29,414
- Love him!
- Gede? That's a nice name.

402
00:21:29,498 --> 00:21:31,166
- Really nice.
- Okay, please stop.

403
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:33,544
Can't wait to hear
all about seaweed farming.

404
00:21:35,337 --> 00:21:37,673
Are you guys sure you're good with this?

405
00:21:38,966 --> 00:21:40,759
'Cause you know you could just tell me.

406
00:21:41,593 --> 00:21:44,012
You don't have to do
a whole Trojan horse thing.

407
00:21:44,847 --> 00:21:48,100
- What... What are you... What are you...
- What? What's it... What's that?

408
00:21:48,183 --> 00:21:50,227
Didn't you tell me that story, Mom?

409
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:51,520
No, I told you. Trojan horse?

410
00:21:51,603 --> 00:21:53,647
- I told you that story. That was me.
- Fine.

411
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:56,900
It doesn't matter.
We just are both here for you.

412
00:21:56,984 --> 00:21:58,193
Yeah. Lockstep.

413
00:22:20,841 --> 00:22:23,594
I don't see why we couldn't have gone
straight to the hotel.

414
00:22:23,677 --> 00:22:26,305
Yeah, well, you were supposed to be here
hours ago.

415
00:22:26,388 --> 00:22:28,390
- It wasn't his fault.
- Pilot error.

416
00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:31,894
The engagement party kinda starts now, so…

417
00:22:31,977 --> 00:22:33,270
Who's gonna be there?

418
00:22:34,021 --> 00:22:35,230
Just close family.

419
00:22:38,609 --> 00:22:41,612
Okay. Time for a walk.

420
00:22:42,529 --> 00:22:43,822
Wait, what?

421
00:22:43,906 --> 00:22:45,073
We get back on at the top.

422
00:22:45,157 --> 00:22:46,742
It just can't make it
with all these people.

423
00:22:46,825 --> 00:22:49,620
Unbelievable.
I want my 4,000 whatevers back.

424
00:22:49,703 --> 00:22:51,622
You know that's like a quarter, right?

425
00:22:56,543 --> 00:22:58,754
Mom, Dad, this is Gede.

426
00:23:04,009 --> 00:23:05,427
Hey.

427
00:23:05,511 --> 00:23:07,471
You learned that
to make me look bad.

428
00:23:07,554 --> 00:23:09,014
You don't need my help there.

429
00:23:09,097 --> 00:23:11,808
Uh, Mr. and Mrs. Cotton,
I welcome you to my country

430
00:23:11,892 --> 00:23:12,893
and soon to my home.

431
00:23:12,976 --> 00:23:15,562
Mrs. Cotton is his mother.
You can just call me Georgia.

432
00:23:15,646 --> 00:23:17,731
Oh, as you wish, Georgia.

433
00:23:20,442 --> 00:23:22,653
Yeah,
I'm good with Mr. Cotton.

434
00:23:24,571 --> 00:23:25,906
- Hi, guys!
- There goes Wren.

435
00:23:25,989 --> 00:23:27,199
Bye, guys!

436
00:23:28,075 --> 00:23:30,202
Uh, Georgia,
perhaps I can give you a lift?

437
00:23:30,285 --> 00:23:31,870
- Oh, let's do it.
- Yeah.

438
00:23:35,082 --> 00:23:36,792
- Bye.
- See you there!

439
00:23:39,169 --> 00:23:40,337
Isn't he amazing?

440
00:23:41,171 --> 00:23:42,422
Only if he drops her.

441
00:23:43,215 --> 00:23:44,508
- Dad...
- Come on. Let's go.

442
00:23:50,848 --> 00:23:52,307
This is just close family?

443
00:23:53,141 --> 00:23:56,603
And the incredible thing is,
is that they're all actually close.

444
00:23:56,687 --> 00:24:00,315
Okay. Remember, shoes off inside,
eat with your right hand,

445
00:24:00,399 --> 00:24:02,901
and never,
ever touch anyone's head.

446
00:24:04,069 --> 00:24:05,821
Why would I wanna touch
anyone's head?

447
00:24:06,697 --> 00:24:07,698
Hey, guys.

448
00:24:07,781 --> 00:24:09,116
Mr. C?

449
00:24:09,199 --> 00:24:13,620
This is Komang,
and these are his tattoos.

450
00:24:13,704 --> 00:24:14,913
Nice to meet you.

451
00:24:14,997 --> 00:24:15,998
He doesn't know it,

452
00:24:16,081 --> 00:24:18,250
but we're gonna be
having breakfast tomorrow.

453
00:24:18,333 --> 00:24:19,334
Hey.

454
00:24:20,794 --> 00:24:22,337
Is she coming to breakfast too?

455
00:24:25,299 --> 00:24:26,925
I need to get one of those.

456
00:24:29,845 --> 00:24:30,929
<i>Putri</i>!

457
00:24:31,013 --> 00:24:32,014
Hey.

458
00:24:32,097 --> 00:24:34,266
- What did he call you?
- It means "daughter."

459
00:24:34,349 --> 00:24:35,851
Oh. Oh.

460
00:24:35,934 --> 00:24:37,769
You're my daughter.

461
00:24:37,853 --> 00:24:38,896
My daughter.

462
00:24:40,355 --> 00:24:42,900
From here on, we will share her.

463
00:24:42,983 --> 00:24:47,779
We'll be united for all of time
in the unbreakable bond of family.

464
00:24:47,863 --> 00:24:50,282
- It's us.
- Okay, yeah. You can let go anytime.

465
00:24:50,949 --> 00:24:52,576
- Good.
- Yeah.

466
00:24:52,659 --> 00:24:53,911
Now give me your knife.

467
00:24:54,703 --> 00:24:55,829
My... My knife?

468
00:24:56,413 --> 00:24:57,414
Give me your knife.

469
00:24:58,248 --> 00:24:59,374
I didn't bring a knife.

470
00:24:59,458 --> 00:25:01,835
- No knife?
- I didn't bring a knife.

471
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:03,170
- No knife?
- No, no...

472
00:25:03,253 --> 00:25:05,839
- Okay.
- No problem.

473
00:25:05,923 --> 00:25:08,217
Wow.

474
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:10,969
It is a Balinese custom
that upon meeting,

475
00:25:11,512 --> 00:25:14,139
the two fathers must cut deeply
into their forearms,

476
00:25:15,349 --> 00:25:18,810
and each smear the other blood.

477
00:25:19,686 --> 00:25:22,272
You should really see your face.

478
00:25:29,112 --> 00:25:31,406
- Hey, guys! Gimme some.
- Hi.

479
00:25:31,490 --> 00:25:33,367
Yeah. Ow, ow, ow!

480
00:25:36,995 --> 00:25:40,165
What's amazing is with such a big family,
there's always something to celebrate.

481
00:25:40,249 --> 00:25:42,751
But if not, they just celebrate
that it's a big family.

482
00:25:42,835 --> 00:25:44,586
Well, I need to celebrate
learning some names

483
00:25:44,670 --> 00:25:46,588
because there's just
too many people to remember.

484
00:25:46,672 --> 00:25:48,841
I did make a spreadsheet.
I haven't gotten most of them.

485
00:25:48,924 --> 00:25:52,803
- I usually just smile a lot.
- Ah, you're in the kitchen. That's new.

486
00:25:52,886 --> 00:25:54,054
Lily!

487
00:25:54,137 --> 00:25:55,138
<i>Meme</i>!

488
00:25:55,222 --> 00:25:59,226
Oh, Mom, Dad, this is
Gede's mother, Suli, and his sister, Losi.

489
00:25:59,309 --> 00:26:01,270
- Losi's training to be a doctor.
- Mmm.

490
00:26:01,353 --> 00:26:03,605
Fantastic. Hi, nice to meet you.

491
00:26:26,044 --> 00:26:27,588
She says, "Welcome."

492
00:26:28,755 --> 00:26:29,756
Oh.

493
00:26:31,842 --> 00:26:34,011
The kids play football out here
in the morning before school.

494
00:26:34,094 --> 00:26:35,971
- Mmm.
- You'd be welcome to join in.

495
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:38,390
Not my game.
I wouldn't count on it.

496
00:26:39,057 --> 00:26:40,350
How do you farm the seaweed?

497
00:26:40,434 --> 00:26:42,186
Oh! Uh, we use nets.

498
00:26:42,269 --> 00:26:44,521
Uh, seedlings are tied
to monofilament lines,

499
00:26:44,605 --> 00:26:47,107
then five weeks later, we bring them in.

500
00:26:47,191 --> 00:26:49,902
A distributor flash freezes it
and ships it out.

501
00:26:49,985 --> 00:26:50,986
Ships it to where?

502
00:26:51,737 --> 00:26:55,073
It used to be mainly Japan.
Now, all over the world.

503
00:26:55,866 --> 00:26:59,369
We just signed a deal with Whole Foods.
So, we're right on your street corner.

504
00:27:01,538 --> 00:27:03,040
Mmm.

505
00:27:10,130 --> 00:27:11,882
He says you are very beautiful.

506
00:27:11,965 --> 00:27:15,093
Oh. Well, um,
tell him I said thank you.

507
00:27:19,139 --> 00:27:22,643
And now he is saying
you remind him of a very attractive horse.

508
00:27:23,185 --> 00:27:25,395
Oh. Really?

509
00:27:26,146 --> 00:27:27,356
That can't be right.

510
00:27:33,987 --> 00:27:36,990
- No, he... He did mean horse.
- Oh.

511
00:27:37,074 --> 00:27:38,659
Mmm.

512
00:27:39,535 --> 00:27:40,536
Oh…

513
00:27:42,246 --> 00:27:43,664
- Mr. Cotton?
- Hmm?

514
00:27:43,747 --> 00:27:46,458
I must tell you,
I love your daughter very much.

515
00:27:46,542 --> 00:27:47,584
I don't blame you.

516
00:27:47,668 --> 00:27:50,128
And I appreciate that
it's happening really fast,

517
00:27:50,212 --> 00:27:52,089
and you and Georgia
must be alarmed by that.

518
00:27:53,131 --> 00:27:57,511
Well, you two seem good together.
Lily loves Bali.

519
00:27:58,262 --> 00:28:00,973
I can see her being happy here.
For a while.

520
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:03,433
For a while?

521
00:28:04,351 --> 00:28:05,978
Well, nothing lasts forever.

522
00:28:07,396 --> 00:28:08,647
Marriage is supposed to.

523
00:28:09,523 --> 00:28:11,859
That's what I thought
till I was sitting across from Georgia

524
00:28:11,942 --> 00:28:14,278
with a bunch of lawyers,
dividing up our stuff.

525
00:28:14,945 --> 00:28:17,823
So, enjoy this.

526
00:28:17,906 --> 00:28:20,868
Right up until the minute
that Lily ends it.

527
00:28:20,951 --> 00:28:25,455
Which she will because she's ambitious,
and she is endlessly curious.

528
00:28:25,539 --> 00:28:30,460
And as beautiful as this island is,
and as pleasant as you seem to be,

529
00:28:31,253 --> 00:28:33,338
ultimately,
it's just not gonna be enough.

530
00:28:35,507 --> 00:28:37,801
A bit of advice. Don't have kids.

531
00:28:37,885 --> 00:28:39,887
Makes it much more complicated
when she takes them

532
00:28:39,970 --> 00:28:41,555
and she goes back to the States.

533
00:28:45,142 --> 00:28:47,686
I'm hungry. You hungry?

534
00:28:47,769 --> 00:28:50,230
Yeah, let's get something to eat.
Let's get some food.

535
00:29:04,912 --> 00:29:08,540
Today, in honor of
our guests of distinction,

536
00:29:08,624 --> 00:29:10,083
I speak to you English.

537
00:29:11,001 --> 00:29:13,795
I'm pretty sure you don't win anything
for finishing the whole pig.

538
00:29:14,713 --> 00:29:18,342
Paul's such a lucky guy.
All that judgment all to himself.

539
00:29:18,425 --> 00:29:24,014
Suli and I welcome with love and peace,
all friends and family, into our home.

540
00:29:24,765 --> 00:29:28,435
Soon also to be the home of Gede and Lily.

541
00:29:29,019 --> 00:29:30,979
- Or not.
- And how proud we are…

542
00:29:31,063 --> 00:29:32,606
Gede is having second thoughts.

543
00:29:32,689 --> 00:29:34,191
I saw the two of you.
What happened?

544
00:29:34,274 --> 00:29:36,818
I initiated phase two.

545
00:29:36,902 --> 00:29:39,321
We get out of the Trojan horse.
We start killing people.

546
00:29:40,030 --> 00:29:41,782
We are nowhere near phase two.

547
00:29:41,865 --> 00:29:43,659
Maybe you're at a different party,

548
00:29:43,742 --> 00:29:47,120
but from where I'm sitting,
we're about to inherit 150 new in-laws.

549
00:29:47,204 --> 00:29:49,289
Oh, God. You only ever
see things your own way.

550
00:29:49,373 --> 00:29:51,083
Everybody only ever
sees anything their own way.

551
00:29:51,166 --> 00:29:52,793
Explains why you walked out
on me and Lily.

552
00:29:52,876 --> 00:29:54,461
I didn't walk out on Lily.

553
00:29:58,549 --> 00:30:01,552
For marriage,
it must to be the right place.

554
00:30:02,302 --> 00:30:04,513
It must to be the right time.

555
00:30:05,222 --> 00:30:07,432
It must to be the right circumstance.

556
00:30:07,516 --> 00:30:10,561
I wish someone had explained that to us.
We were 0 for 3.

557
00:30:11,436 --> 00:30:12,855
- I for 3.
- Hmm?

558
00:30:12,938 --> 00:30:13,939
1 for 3.

559
00:30:14,731 --> 00:30:16,358
Wrong circumstance, wrong time.

560
00:30:16,441 --> 00:30:19,820
Right place. By the lake.

561
00:30:20,612 --> 00:30:26,493
So, I announce that Gede will marry Lily
in four days' time,

562
00:30:26,577 --> 00:30:29,788
as suggested by
<i>Ida Anak Lingsir</i>.

563
00:30:32,833 --> 00:30:35,210
Mother of my children, do you agree?

564
00:30:42,259 --> 00:30:45,262
She gives her blessing.
For now and for always.

565
00:30:46,096 --> 00:30:49,474
And David? Georgia? Do you agree?

566
00:30:50,851 --> 00:30:53,604
Um, yes, we give our blessing.

567
00:30:54,396 --> 00:30:56,148
- Yep.
- Yes. For now...

568
00:30:56,231 --> 00:30:57,649
- And always.
- And always.

569
00:30:57,733 --> 00:30:58,734
- Great.
- Right.

570
00:30:58,817 --> 00:30:59,818
That's good.

571
00:31:05,282 --> 00:31:09,828
That went great.
Just great.

572
00:31:09,912 --> 00:31:12,915
Absolutely it did.
Could not have gone any better.

573
00:31:16,835 --> 00:31:18,754
What were you and my dad
talking about by the beach?

574
00:31:18,837 --> 00:31:21,381
Seaweed, mostly.
He had a lot of questions.

575
00:31:23,842 --> 00:31:26,011
He loves you.

576
00:31:26,094 --> 00:31:29,139
He loves you. They both do.

577
00:31:30,599 --> 00:31:34,311
Well, I'm the only thing
they can ever agree on.

578
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:36,021
Really?

579
00:31:36,813 --> 00:31:37,814
Good to know.

580
00:31:40,901 --> 00:31:42,986
<i>Welcome to the Hotel Waruna.</i>

581
00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:47,324
<i>It is a very great pleasure
to see your smiling faces.</i>

582
00:31:48,909 --> 00:31:52,913
You, sir, are in 221. Really good room.

583
00:31:53,956 --> 00:31:55,249
Make sure I'm a long way
from her.

584
00:31:55,832 --> 00:31:56,834
And you, madam?

585
00:31:58,168 --> 00:31:59,962
A very long way, please.

586
00:32:00,045 --> 00:32:03,382
222. Almost just as really good.

587
00:32:05,634 --> 00:32:06,885
Do you still snore?

588
00:32:07,886 --> 00:32:10,848
Do you know anybody that snores less
when they get older?

589
00:32:11,348 --> 00:32:13,600
If I'm gonna be listening
to you all night,

590
00:32:13,684 --> 00:32:15,644
I'm gonna do it from the better room.

591
00:32:16,812 --> 00:32:18,981
You know, you used to do sleep karate.

592
00:32:19,064 --> 00:32:21,900
You'd fling yourself around the bed
like you were attacking it.

593
00:32:22,442 --> 00:32:25,279
I wasn't asleep.
I was attacking you.

594
00:32:25,362 --> 00:32:26,363
There you go.

595
00:32:28,323 --> 00:32:29,741
Try to keep the snoring down.

596
00:32:29,825 --> 00:32:33,203
- I have a nasal strip.
- It's a mystery you're still alone.

597
00:32:54,349 --> 00:32:55,475
Ah!

598
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:04,276
Get another one of these?

599
00:33:05,569 --> 00:33:07,321
I'll have two of whatever he's having.

600
00:33:08,906 --> 00:33:10,949
Hello, Wren.
What are you doing here?

601
00:33:11,033 --> 00:33:12,492
Unlike your daughter,
I've never been

602
00:33:12,576 --> 00:33:15,204
a thatched-hut-with-a-dirt-floor
kind of gal.

603
00:33:15,287 --> 00:33:17,831
I've got a nicely appointed
broom closet here.

604
00:33:17,915 --> 00:33:18,916
Good for you.

605
00:33:20,792 --> 00:33:23,253
You know, I blame you
for this whole shit show.

606
00:33:23,337 --> 00:33:24,463
That's what you think of it?

607
00:33:25,297 --> 00:33:26,298
You don't?

608
00:33:27,382 --> 00:33:28,967
Lily's happy.

609
00:33:29,051 --> 00:33:32,179
And after four years of watching her
beat herself up at college,

610
00:33:32,262 --> 00:33:33,889
I love to see that.

611
00:33:34,723 --> 00:33:36,058
I thought you might too.

612
00:33:36,141 --> 00:33:40,354
Hey, look, happy is great.
Lily happy is the greatest of all.

613
00:33:40,437 --> 00:33:45,609
It's just that a weird thing happens
when you become a parent.

614
00:33:45,692 --> 00:33:50,113
When your kid is down,
when they're in pain, it kills you.

615
00:33:50,781 --> 00:33:53,200
But when they're up,
when things are going great,

616
00:33:54,910 --> 00:33:56,870
that's when you get really scared.

617
00:33:56,954 --> 00:33:59,248
Because you don't want it to change,

618
00:33:59,331 --> 00:34:00,749
and you know it will.

619
00:34:01,708 --> 00:34:02,835
Does it always?

620
00:34:08,422 --> 00:34:09,675
Lily's never said.

621
00:34:10,551 --> 00:34:12,219
What happened with you and Mrs. C?

622
00:34:12,844 --> 00:34:15,097
Same thing that happens
in every relationship.

623
00:34:16,431 --> 00:34:18,516
When it started out, it was unreal…

624
00:34:20,643 --> 00:34:22,271
Then it got real.

625
00:34:29,485 --> 00:34:30,696
Um…

626
00:34:31,405 --> 00:34:33,949
We used to bike out to this place
by the lake.

627
00:34:34,783 --> 00:34:37,411
You know, read, eat, whatever.

628
00:34:39,204 --> 00:34:43,333
And then one day I saw that that place,
that spot, was for sale.

629
00:34:43,417 --> 00:34:45,043
Now, we were young. We had nothing.

630
00:34:45,627 --> 00:34:48,338
But I said,
"Someday, we should live here."

631
00:34:48,422 --> 00:34:53,385
And then she said,
with that smile in her voice,

632
00:34:55,304 --> 00:34:58,098
"Why wait?
Why save the good stuff for later?

633
00:34:58,182 --> 00:35:00,893
Don't we deserve some good stuff
along the way?"

634
00:35:01,768 --> 00:35:03,103
Ah…

635
00:35:03,187 --> 00:35:04,229
She was right.

636
00:35:04,313 --> 00:35:06,982
Which happens occasionally.

637
00:35:10,027 --> 00:35:11,486
Well…

638
00:35:11,570 --> 00:35:13,822
We saved and we scrambled,
and next thing you know,

639
00:35:13,906 --> 00:35:16,742
I'm building the perfect house
in the perfect spot.

640
00:35:21,914 --> 00:35:25,125
So, I was busy.
I was working, paying off our debt.

641
00:35:25,209 --> 00:35:26,752
I was tired. She was tired.

642
00:35:29,129 --> 00:35:32,257
Then, pretty soon, it didn't feel like
we were married at all.

643
00:35:33,967 --> 00:35:35,511
Just felt like we were…

644
00:35:37,304 --> 00:35:40,557
Running a day care camp
with someone I used to go out with.

645
00:35:44,436 --> 00:35:47,523
We were sniping. We were fighting.
We were tearing each other down.

646
00:35:47,606 --> 00:35:50,651
And I thought,
if I could just get her in that house…

647
00:35:52,569 --> 00:35:53,737
It'd fix everything.

648
00:35:56,448 --> 00:35:57,658
Make everything okay.

649
00:36:01,161 --> 00:36:05,874
So, one night I get a call
from the people who lived across the lake.

650
00:36:07,543 --> 00:36:10,045
They said they'd seen these flames.

651
00:36:16,301 --> 00:36:20,138
By the time I got there, it was just ash.

652
00:36:23,684 --> 00:36:26,854
Three weeks later, we were done.

653
00:36:29,523 --> 00:36:30,691
Over a house?

654
00:36:31,942 --> 00:36:33,569
Seemed like a lot more than that.

655
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:39,908
Good night, Wren.

656
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,552
<i>Hey, it's looking like
I'm not going to make it</i>

657
00:36:58,635 --> 00:36:59,803
<i>till the morning of the wedding.</i>

658
00:36:59,887 --> 00:37:02,723
<i>Uh, I'm so sorry, baby. How's Lily?</i>

659
00:37:02,806 --> 00:37:03,807
Crazy in love.

660
00:37:03,891 --> 00:37:05,100
That's fantastic!

661
00:37:05,184 --> 00:37:06,935
- <i>It's terrible.
</i>- I couldn't agree more.

662
00:37:07,019 --> 00:37:08,145
She's making a mistake.

663
00:37:08,228 --> 00:37:10,397
And now there's some kind of ceremony.

664
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:13,066
Gede and Lily exchange rings.
It's a whole thing.

665
00:37:13,150 --> 00:37:14,818
They're not doing the rings
at the wedding?

666
00:37:14,902 --> 00:37:16,403
There's not gonna be a wedding.

667
00:37:16,486 --> 00:37:19,656
I won't let her throw her life away
on some insanely handsome guy

668
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:21,992
who happens to live
in the most beautiful place on earth.

669
00:37:22,075 --> 00:37:24,369
And yes, I do know how that sounds,
but I'm still right.

670
00:37:24,453 --> 00:37:26,622
You're always right, baby.

671
00:37:26,705 --> 00:37:27,706
We got action.

672
00:37:27,789 --> 00:37:29,416
I'm really not. Gotta go.

673
00:37:33,587 --> 00:37:34,630
- Talk to me.
- All right.

674
00:37:34,713 --> 00:37:36,381
The happy couple's
about to stand up there.

675
00:37:36,465 --> 00:37:37,758
The ring bearer brings two rings

676
00:37:37,841 --> 00:37:40,135
that have been blessed by the hat guy
for them to exchange.

677
00:37:40,219 --> 00:37:41,553
But if they don't,

678
00:37:41,637 --> 00:37:43,680
it messes with the whole
"right place, right time"...

679
00:37:43,764 --> 00:37:45,307
- We steal the rings.
- I was about to say that.

680
00:37:45,390 --> 00:37:46,683
But you didn't. So it's my idea.

681
00:37:46,767 --> 00:37:49,603
Okay, well,
the ring bearer is Gede's cousin.

682
00:37:53,273 --> 00:37:54,274
Why me?

683
00:37:54,358 --> 00:37:55,817
The hard stuff was always your thing.

684
00:37:55,901 --> 00:37:59,071
My thing was taking out the garbage
and getting things off of high shelves.

685
00:37:59,154 --> 00:38:01,823
Not that high, really.
And flattery won't work.

686
00:38:01,907 --> 00:38:03,784
- But you'll do it anyway.
- Why?

687
00:38:03,867 --> 00:38:05,577
Because it was your idea.

688
00:38:15,879 --> 00:38:17,005
Hey, guys!

689
00:38:17,089 --> 00:38:19,383
Can you play a chasing game with us?

690
00:38:19,466 --> 00:38:20,884
Can I show you something first?

691
00:38:20,968 --> 00:38:21,969
Ah!

692
00:38:22,052 --> 00:38:24,054
Let me show you something.
'Cause, see, I'm from America,

693
00:38:24,137 --> 00:38:27,891
and in America,
we eat bananas a little differently.

694
00:38:27,975 --> 00:38:31,687
We slice them before we peel them.

695
00:38:31,770 --> 00:38:33,772
Not true!

696
00:38:33,856 --> 00:38:35,065
Totally true!

697
00:38:36,149 --> 00:38:38,527
Here, I'll show you.
Come here. Come sit up here.

698
00:38:40,571 --> 00:38:43,073
All right. See this banana?
Totally normal-looking, right?

699
00:38:43,156 --> 00:38:44,741
- It's not cut on the outside.
- Not cut.

700
00:38:44,825 --> 00:38:47,578
All right. So, I want you to take it...
Here, put your bag down.

701
00:38:47,661 --> 00:38:49,204
You're gonna take it and peel it.

702
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:55,836
Whoa!

703
00:38:58,881 --> 00:39:00,132
That's how it's done.

704
00:39:06,263 --> 00:39:08,098
<i>So the rings that we'll give each other</i>

705
00:39:08,182 --> 00:39:11,977
have been blessed in the sacred water
of Pura Ulun Danu Batur.

706
00:39:13,478 --> 00:39:14,563
I do the hard stuff.

707
00:39:17,482 --> 00:39:19,651
Can't believe
they fell for the banana trick.

708
00:39:20,319 --> 00:39:22,279
It really kills you
that you haven't figured it out.

709
00:39:22,362 --> 00:39:23,280
Ah…

710
00:39:23,363 --> 00:39:25,657
Maybe we'll show them to you.
Uh, Ketut has them.

711
00:39:25,741 --> 00:39:26,742
Ketut?

712
00:39:26,825 --> 00:39:28,744
Here we go.

713
00:39:28,827 --> 00:39:29,828
Hey!

714
00:39:30,913 --> 00:39:32,497
Can you show us the rings? Yeah?

715
00:39:34,458 --> 00:39:37,878
Hmm, where are the rings?
There's nothing in there.

716
00:39:37,961 --> 00:39:39,713
- Shh.
- It's empty.

717
00:39:40,631 --> 00:39:42,257
- It's gone.
- Okay.

718
00:39:42,341 --> 00:39:44,176
Mmm?

719
00:39:46,803 --> 00:39:47,804
Losi!

720
00:39:50,807 --> 00:39:51,892
What is he saying?

721
00:39:51,975 --> 00:39:53,810
- I wasn't listening.
- Cool.

722
00:39:55,395 --> 00:39:59,316
Uh, "We have to have the rings
for the circumstances to be right."

723
00:39:59,399 --> 00:40:00,400
Yeah.

724
00:40:01,485 --> 00:40:03,487
Now no one knows what to do.

725
00:40:03,570 --> 00:40:05,113
And Ketut is crying.

726
00:40:05,197 --> 00:40:06,657
Ah…

727
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:08,200
Hey, sweetie, it's okay.

728
00:40:08,283 --> 00:40:10,786
- Tell her it's gonna be okay.
- It's not gonna be okay.

729
00:40:10,869 --> 00:40:13,038
Look, if we don't have the rings,
then we can't...

730
00:40:17,918 --> 00:40:19,378
You're right. It's not a problem.

731
00:40:19,461 --> 00:40:20,462
We'll find other rings.

732
00:40:20,546 --> 00:40:24,216
Yeah. Did you hear that? It's fine.
We'll just do it another day. It's okay.

733
00:40:32,057 --> 00:40:33,058
How do they look?

734
00:40:34,101 --> 00:40:35,561
I'll do the stretch thing.

735
00:40:35,644 --> 00:40:36,728
The classic.

736
00:40:41,108 --> 00:40:42,401
Disappointed.

737
00:40:42,484 --> 00:40:43,819
- That's good.
- Is it?

738
00:40:43,902 --> 00:40:44,903
What do you mean?

739
00:40:44,987 --> 00:40:47,030
I mean, our daughter looks like
her dog just died.

740
00:40:47,114 --> 00:40:49,032
I don't know if I feel great about that.

741
00:40:49,658 --> 00:40:51,869
- We're nearly there.
- Where?

742
00:40:52,536 --> 00:40:53,620
You'll see.

743
00:40:55,289 --> 00:40:56,874
I think he knows.

744
00:40:56,957 --> 00:40:58,458
He doesn't know.

745
00:41:00,377 --> 00:41:02,087
Okay.

746
00:41:02,671 --> 00:41:04,798
- Are they here?
- They're here.

747
00:41:04,882 --> 00:41:05,883
Who's here?

748
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:13,182
Dolphins.

749
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:17,561
Are you kidding?

750
00:41:17,644 --> 00:41:19,730
It gets better.

751
00:41:22,774 --> 00:41:23,775
What are you doing?

752
00:41:24,443 --> 00:41:25,777
Ah, don't be afraid, Mr. Cotton.

753
00:41:26,653 --> 00:41:27,654
I'm not afraid.

754
00:41:27,738 --> 00:41:29,323
- You are.
- No, I'm not.

755
00:41:29,907 --> 00:41:31,783
I'm not afraid. Whoo!

756
00:41:31,867 --> 00:41:32,910
Hey!

757
00:41:36,205 --> 00:41:37,956
Oh, my God. This is amazing!

758
00:41:44,254 --> 00:41:45,839
Whoo!

759
00:41:56,141 --> 00:41:57,142
Mom.

760
00:42:00,062 --> 00:42:01,897
Hey, are you sure
they're not sharks?

761
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:02,981
They're not sharks.

762
00:42:03,065 --> 00:42:05,651
They might be working with the sharks,
you know, to get us.

763
00:42:05,734 --> 00:42:08,612
- Don't miss out. Come on. Get in.
- Come on. Don't be a chicken.

764
00:42:08,695 --> 00:42:10,113
- I'm not chicken.
- Come on, chicken.

765
00:42:10,197 --> 00:42:12,991
- Oh, stop it.
- You've turned chicken in your old age.

766
00:42:13,075 --> 00:42:14,451
- I'm chicken?
- Come on, David!

767
00:42:14,535 --> 00:42:16,495
I'll show you chicken.

768
00:42:16,578 --> 00:42:18,080
I'll go. Let's go!

769
00:42:25,963 --> 00:42:27,673
Ooh…

770
00:42:27,756 --> 00:42:29,550
Can't believe I got bit by a dolphin.

771
00:42:29,633 --> 00:42:30,968
You were grazed.

772
00:42:31,051 --> 00:42:33,220
- This has never happened before.
- Yeah.

773
00:42:33,303 --> 00:42:34,304
Dad?

774
00:42:34,388 --> 00:42:35,514
Dad? Dad!

775
00:42:35,597 --> 00:42:37,474
Be careful with him. Does it hurt?

776
00:42:37,558 --> 00:42:39,893
I bet it was that crazy-looking one
with the smile.

777
00:42:39,977 --> 00:42:40,978
All dolphins smile.

778
00:42:41,061 --> 00:42:42,145
Now we know why.

779
00:42:42,229 --> 00:42:43,647
- It wasn't Gede's fault.
- Yeah.

780
00:42:43,730 --> 00:42:45,274
We know. These things happen.

781
00:42:45,357 --> 00:42:47,192
No, he did just say they don't.

782
00:42:47,276 --> 00:42:49,194
Georgia, can you please apply pressure?

783
00:42:49,278 --> 00:42:51,196
I'm gonna go grab some bandages.

784
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:52,948
We wouldn't want you to lose your leg.

785
00:42:53,031 --> 00:42:54,324
What?

786
00:42:54,408 --> 00:42:56,326
Enough things
have already been lost today.

787
00:42:59,454 --> 00:43:00,622
Oh, yeah. He knows.

788
00:43:01,665 --> 00:43:03,292
- Does it hurt when I do that?
- What's wrong with you?

789
00:43:03,375 --> 00:43:05,669
- He said, "Pressure. Georgia, pressure."
- Stop!

790
00:43:08,255 --> 00:43:09,631
It's like I looked up and realized

791
00:43:09,715 --> 00:43:12,176
that everything I ever wanted
was right in front of me.

792
00:43:12,759 --> 00:43:15,262
I mean, I could go back
and try and make a go of it,

793
00:43:15,345 --> 00:43:19,266
but I just know that every second
I'd be dreaming of being here…

794
00:43:21,143 --> 00:43:22,144
With him.

795
00:43:23,061 --> 00:43:25,772
You know, it's like you always say,
why save the good stuff for later?

796
00:43:27,441 --> 00:43:29,193
Yeah, I do.

797
00:43:31,111 --> 00:43:32,196
I do.

798
00:43:32,279 --> 00:43:35,032
Excuse me. I'd like to get these.

799
00:43:35,115 --> 00:43:36,200
You're tourists, yes?

800
00:43:36,283 --> 00:43:39,119
Uh, well, she is, but I live here now.

801
00:43:40,078 --> 00:43:42,039
Ah, then we haggle.

802
00:43:42,122 --> 00:43:45,501
Oh. Uh, no, we don't need to haggle.
Just give me a fair price.

803
00:43:46,376 --> 00:43:47,836
Tourists like it when we haggle.

804
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:49,963
Americans like make good deals.

805
00:43:50,047 --> 00:43:52,132
800,000 rupiah?

806
00:43:52,216 --> 00:43:53,509
Okay.

807
00:43:53,592 --> 00:43:56,178
No, no. You say 500,000.

808
00:43:58,138 --> 00:43:59,264
Just go with it, Mom.

809
00:44:00,015 --> 00:44:02,601
Um… 500,000.

810
00:44:02,684 --> 00:44:05,395
Enough, please. You're killing me.
Seven.

811
00:44:05,479 --> 00:44:07,481
Six. Or I'm walking away.

812
00:44:07,564 --> 00:44:09,274
We have a deal.

813
00:44:10,275 --> 00:44:11,318
Thank you.

814
00:44:12,194 --> 00:44:14,905
I'm just so crazy grateful for you, Mom.

815
00:44:14,988 --> 00:44:16,573
There's no need.

816
00:44:16,657 --> 00:44:18,075
Yes, there is.

817
00:44:18,158 --> 00:44:20,410
This is the biggest decision
I've ever made in my life.

818
00:44:20,494 --> 00:44:22,871
You came halfway around the world
to have my back.

819
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:28,502
You are a very kind woman.
Thank you.

820
00:44:29,419 --> 00:44:31,046
I'm really not. I...

821
00:44:34,424 --> 00:44:37,010
I don't know what this is, but I like it.

822
00:44:37,094 --> 00:44:38,679
Yeah, it's called a martabak.

823
00:44:39,429 --> 00:44:40,430
Martabak?

824
00:44:41,557 --> 00:44:44,434
Listen, um,
Lily and I will get other rings,

825
00:44:44,518 --> 00:44:46,854
but it would be much better
if you just give them back.

826
00:44:46,937 --> 00:44:49,022
What are you talking about?
I don't have your rings.

827
00:44:49,106 --> 00:44:51,900
I didn't say anything
to Lily, and I won't.

828
00:44:51,984 --> 00:44:54,278
But, Mr. Cotton, I need you and Georgia
to stop now, please.

829
00:44:54,361 --> 00:44:55,279
You know what I think?

830
00:44:55,362 --> 00:44:58,532
You didn't say anything to Lily because
you're afraid she might be having doubts.

831
00:44:58,615 --> 00:44:59,825
And if you did say something,

832
00:44:59,908 --> 00:45:02,494
she might listen to those doubts.
Or worse, she might act on them.

833
00:45:02,578 --> 00:45:05,163
I haven't told Lily because I know
it would hurt her very much to know

834
00:45:05,247 --> 00:45:07,082
the reason her parents
are finally getting along

835
00:45:07,165 --> 00:45:09,251
is because they're united
to sabotage her relationship.

836
00:45:09,334 --> 00:45:11,211
If anyone here is afraid, it's you.

837
00:45:12,588 --> 00:45:14,339
I'm not here
to steal your daughter from you.

838
00:45:14,423 --> 00:45:15,716
That's the last thing I want to do.

839
00:45:15,799 --> 00:45:17,885
She's not a competition to be won or lost.

840
00:45:19,344 --> 00:45:20,512
Look, trust me.

841
00:45:20,596 --> 00:45:22,973
If Lily finds out
what you two are really doing,

842
00:45:23,056 --> 00:45:24,558
you'll most certainly lose her then.

843
00:45:26,476 --> 00:45:27,686
Enjoy your martabak.

844
00:45:33,233 --> 00:45:36,403
Remind me, were the guys
in the Trojan horse the good guys?

845
00:45:36,486 --> 00:45:37,905
Good or bad, they won the war.

846
00:45:37,988 --> 00:45:39,364
And what was the war about exactly?

847
00:45:39,448 --> 00:45:41,241
- Don't do this, Georgia.
- Do you think we're wrong?

848
00:45:41,325 --> 00:45:43,118
- We're not wrong.
- I think we might be wrong.

849
00:45:43,202 --> 00:45:46,038
Remember when we agreed
to do this together? To be in lockstep?

850
00:45:46,121 --> 00:45:48,957
Yeah, but that was before we saw her.
Saw them.

851
00:45:49,041 --> 00:45:50,417
You know...

852
00:45:50,501 --> 00:45:53,003
Great. Classic. You win again.

853
00:45:53,086 --> 00:45:54,254
What does that even mean?

854
00:45:54,338 --> 00:45:56,882
You know what? I had Lily one day a week
and every other weekend.

855
00:45:56,965 --> 00:45:59,134
You had her all the rest of the time.

856
00:45:59,218 --> 00:46:01,386
She listened to you, she relied on you,

857
00:46:01,470 --> 00:46:04,348
and now you get to be the one
that gives her everything she wants.

858
00:46:04,431 --> 00:46:06,099
I never get to give her what she wants.

859
00:46:06,183 --> 00:46:08,852
Yes, I was there for her.
To make the rules, to fight with.

860
00:46:08,936 --> 00:46:11,522
You were fun Dad. You would breeze in,
take her where she wanted to go,

861
00:46:11,605 --> 00:46:13,357
buy her anything she wanted,
then drop her off.

862
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:15,317
- I didn't want that.
- Then you shouldn't have left.

863
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:16,652
- I had to. It was over.
- Why?

864
00:46:16,735 --> 00:46:18,695
- Because the house burned down?
- You didn't love me anymore.

865
00:46:18,779 --> 00:46:20,489
- You didn't like me.
- You didn't have respect for me.

866
00:46:20,572 --> 00:46:23,659
- You've never had any respect for me.
- That is so unbelievably untrue.

867
00:46:23,742 --> 00:46:25,661
When you proposed,
did you really want to get married

868
00:46:25,744 --> 00:46:27,538
or you just didn't want me
to take that job in LA?

869
00:46:27,621 --> 00:46:29,540
I wanted to be happy.
I wanted you to be happy.

870
00:46:29,623 --> 00:46:31,416
- Well, I am happy now.
- Good. So am I.

871
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:32,501
- Good.
- Great.

872
00:46:32,584 --> 00:46:33,585
Great.

873
00:47:13,917 --> 00:47:14,918
- Hi.
- Hey.

874
00:47:15,002 --> 00:47:16,170
What time is it?

875
00:47:16,253 --> 00:47:17,254
The best time.

876
00:47:17,337 --> 00:47:18,422
Ah.

877
00:47:19,715 --> 00:47:21,633
You don't look like you were sleeping.

878
00:47:21,717 --> 00:47:23,719
Mmm, I moisturize before bed.

879
00:47:24,511 --> 00:47:26,513
All right. Well, let's wake up... Oh.

880
00:47:27,139 --> 00:47:28,140
What's going on?

881
00:47:29,099 --> 00:47:30,267
Hi.

882
00:47:30,893 --> 00:47:31,894
Hi.

883
00:47:35,564 --> 00:47:38,734
Okay, um, I've got a little job
for you guys.

884
00:47:39,484 --> 00:47:40,652
Come on. Let's go.

885
00:47:49,328 --> 00:47:50,871
I can't believe we're out here.

886
00:47:51,830 --> 00:47:54,583
I'm not sure you should be,
with your wound.

887
00:47:54,666 --> 00:47:56,126
Sharks are drawn to blood.

888
00:48:02,466 --> 00:48:04,384
She listened to you. Always.

889
00:48:06,470 --> 00:48:07,471
What?

890
00:48:08,096 --> 00:48:09,431
She still does.

891
00:48:09,515 --> 00:48:12,559
She never needed to make me as happy
as she wanted to make you.

892
00:48:16,146 --> 00:48:18,899
She's just so like you.

893
00:48:18,982 --> 00:48:21,652
I think she's so like you.

894
00:48:27,074 --> 00:48:29,117
Um, and I'll tell you something else.

895
00:48:29,201 --> 00:48:32,955
I'm looking at your pile of seaweed
and at mine,

896
00:48:33,038 --> 00:48:35,249
and, of course,
it's totally not a competition.

897
00:48:35,332 --> 00:48:37,918
But if it was…

898
00:48:39,044 --> 00:48:40,170
I'd be winning.

899
00:48:44,299 --> 00:48:46,510
- Good thing it's not a competition.
- It's a good thing.

900
00:48:57,312 --> 00:48:59,773
- Hey! You're supposed to be gentle!
- Get off me. Get off!

901
00:48:59,857 --> 00:49:01,400
- Excuse me!
- Get off it.

902
00:49:01,483 --> 00:49:03,193
That's mine! That's mine.

903
00:49:04,361 --> 00:49:05,988
- Get off.
- Hey!

904
00:49:06,071 --> 00:49:08,740
Get off me. Get off! Get off!

905
00:49:08,824 --> 00:49:10,617
- What are you doing?
- That was mine.

906
00:49:10,701 --> 00:49:12,119
That was mine. You took mine.

907
00:49:12,202 --> 00:49:14,496
- Get off. Get off of it.
- Will you stop it?

908
00:49:15,747 --> 00:49:17,165
Well, this is getting weird.

909
00:49:26,884 --> 00:49:28,802
Well, that worked till it didn't.

910
00:49:28,886 --> 00:49:30,345
They got new rings.

911
00:49:31,054 --> 00:49:33,307
Thank you for helping
with the harvest this morning.

912
00:49:34,057 --> 00:49:35,642
Who won?

913
00:49:35,726 --> 00:49:37,561
No, it wasn't a competition.

914
00:49:41,023 --> 00:49:42,858
You told her
it wasn't a competition, right?

915
00:49:42,941 --> 00:49:45,861
That is exactly what I said.
The hug is about something else.

916
00:49:46,486 --> 00:49:48,363
Okay, the <i>met at ah</i> is beginning.

917
00:49:48,447 --> 00:49:49,448
- <i>Metatah.
</i>- What?

918
00:49:49,531 --> 00:49:50,532
<i>Metatah.</i>

919
00:49:53,118 --> 00:49:55,078
You're with me in this, right? Lockstep?

920
00:49:55,913 --> 00:49:57,039
- Lockstep.
- In lockstep.

921
00:49:57,122 --> 00:49:58,248
- Absolutely.
- Okay.

922
00:50:13,931 --> 00:50:15,849
- How is this even a thing?
- Ow!

923
00:50:15,933 --> 00:50:19,019
They believe that filing down the canine
teeth takes us away from the animals,

924
00:50:19,102 --> 00:50:21,188
so away from qualities
that lead to an unhappy marriage.

925
00:50:22,356 --> 00:50:25,734
Takes away the ability
to chew solid food, is what it does.

926
00:50:28,237 --> 00:50:30,572
I knew a guy who wanted
to marry a Jewish woman.

927
00:50:30,656 --> 00:50:33,659
Had to get circumcised.
This is worse.

928
00:50:33,742 --> 00:50:34,743
Ah!

929
00:50:36,078 --> 00:50:38,163
No, that's worse.

930
00:50:41,166 --> 00:50:43,460
Aw, did it hurt?

931
00:50:43,544 --> 00:50:45,462
I mean, was it as bad as it looked?

932
00:50:45,546 --> 00:50:47,339
It was very painful agony.

933
00:50:47,422 --> 00:50:49,424
Which is why we're here
for some anesthetic.

934
00:50:49,508 --> 00:50:51,260
Here you go. Arrack all around.

935
00:50:51,343 --> 00:50:53,053
- Thanks.
- What's "arrack"?

936
00:50:53,136 --> 00:50:55,013
I don't know, but last time I was here,

937
00:50:55,097 --> 00:50:57,266
I woke up in a tree
with all this sand in my mouth.

938
00:50:57,349 --> 00:50:58,350
Oh.

939
00:50:58,433 --> 00:51:01,478
It's a local palm moonshine.
Not for the faint of heart.

940
00:51:03,730 --> 00:51:04,940
Yeah.

941
00:51:06,650 --> 00:51:08,151
- Little help?
- There you go.

942
00:51:10,571 --> 00:51:11,572
- Mmm.
- Ooh.

943
00:51:14,074 --> 00:51:15,409
It's not that bad.

944
00:51:15,492 --> 00:51:18,495
Seriously, Mr. C,
beware the arrack attack.

945
00:51:18,579 --> 00:51:20,789
Oh, no, no, no.
This is not his first rodeo.

946
00:51:20,873 --> 00:51:22,833
Remember all the beer pong
we played in college?

947
00:51:22,916 --> 00:51:25,002
Practically minored in it.
You were unbelievable.

948
00:51:25,085 --> 00:51:27,504
Well, yes, but you had game too.

949
00:51:27,588 --> 00:51:28,964
I did have game.

950
00:51:29,047 --> 00:51:30,424
Own it. Own it in here.

951
00:51:30,507 --> 00:51:32,509
You're the warrior, man.
You are the warrior.

952
00:51:32,593 --> 00:51:36,513
Come on. Get in there. Get in there!
Yeah, boy. Yes, Shauny!

953
00:51:36,597 --> 00:51:37,681
Big Shaun!

954
00:51:39,850 --> 00:51:40,851
Damn it!

955
00:51:40,934 --> 00:51:42,352
Okay, so that's beer pong?

956
00:51:42,436 --> 00:51:43,437
Big Shaun?

957
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:46,190
It's not for the faint of heart.

958
00:51:47,107 --> 00:51:48,400
Uh-oh.

959
00:51:49,276 --> 00:51:50,277
Let's go.

960
00:51:50,360 --> 00:51:51,361
Yeah?

961
00:51:52,279 --> 00:51:53,447
Couple against couple?

962
00:51:53,530 --> 00:51:54,698
Really?

963
00:51:54,781 --> 00:51:56,241
Mm-hmm.

964
00:51:56,325 --> 00:51:58,368
And not beer. Arrack.

965
00:51:58,452 --> 00:51:59,661
Arrack. Fine, let's go.

966
00:52:00,329 --> 00:52:01,872
That's not a good idea.

967
00:52:01,955 --> 00:52:04,082
- The setup is important.
- That's it.

968
00:52:04,166 --> 00:52:05,667
All right. Give me a practice.

969
00:52:05,751 --> 00:52:06,919
You're gonna need it.

970
00:52:07,002 --> 00:52:08,295
Okay, watch your dad.

971
00:52:08,378 --> 00:52:11,089
- Practice. Just a practice. Boom. Boom.
- Yeah. Just a quick...

972
00:52:11,173 --> 00:52:13,509
- Wait, what was that?
- I gotta stretch. Hang on.

973
00:52:13,592 --> 00:52:15,886
I gotta stretch. I gotta stretch!
Give me a chance.

974
00:52:15,969 --> 00:52:18,514
- Remember the old days. The old way!
- All right, here we go!

975
00:52:18,597 --> 00:52:21,558
Can we get something a little more
age-appropriate for these two?

976
00:52:21,642 --> 00:52:23,602
Something old-school?

977
00:52:23,685 --> 00:52:25,854
- Focus, really. Don't blow it.
- Get ready. And…

978
00:52:30,275 --> 00:52:31,610
Oh, no.

979
00:52:31,693 --> 00:52:33,153
Oh, no, no, no.

980
00:52:33,237 --> 00:52:34,530
Oh, no, no. Dad?

981
00:52:34,613 --> 00:52:36,490
- Dad, please stop doing that.
- Oh, yeah!

982
00:52:39,243 --> 00:52:40,786
People are looking!

983
00:52:40,869 --> 00:52:41,912
- Boom!
- Dad.

984
00:52:42,579 --> 00:52:44,498
Dad, stop doing that!

985
00:52:44,581 --> 00:52:47,835
Oh, my God. Everybody's looking.
Call it off right now. Call it off.

986
00:52:47,918 --> 00:52:49,962
Old-school moves.

987
00:52:52,965 --> 00:52:57,010
- Dinosaur moves. Damn!
- I am praying for an asteroid.

Nothing. We didn't do anything.

last night.

00:55:56,481 --> 00:55:57,983

- No one can see us like this.

Georgia, my love.

1061
00:56:13,957 --> 00:56:15,626
- That's Paul. That's my boyfriend.
- What?

1062
00:56:15,709 --> 00:56:17,544
Did you tell him
you don't like surprises?

1063
00:56:17,628 --> 00:56:20,756
He surprises me so much. It's almost
not a surprise when he surprises me.

1064
00:56:20,839 --> 00:56:23,509
- Georgia? It's me. It's Paul.
- Okay. Wait.

1065
00:56:23,592 --> 00:56:25,969
- I'm sneaking around. Distract him.
- What? What?

1066
00:56:26,053 --> 00:56:27,596
- Distract him!
- You distract him!

1067
00:56:27,679 --> 00:56:29,473
- Georgia, open the door.
- Fuck!

1068
00:56:30,891 --> 00:56:31,892
Hey, Paul.

1069
00:56:31,975 --> 00:56:34,937
- David. I thought this was...
- Georgia's room?

1070
00:56:35,020 --> 00:56:36,897
- Yeah.
- No. It's my room. That's her room.

1071
00:56:36,980 --> 00:56:39,024
This is my room.
Hi, sweetie. I thought I heard you.

1072
00:56:39,107 --> 00:56:40,484
- In that room.
- Which is my room.

1073
00:56:40,567 --> 00:56:42,027
But, I thought the guy said...

1074
00:56:42,110 --> 00:56:43,987
- No, we changed rooms.
- So this could be my room.

1075
00:56:44,071 --> 00:56:45,447
It's a much better room.

1076
00:56:46,031 --> 00:56:47,282
- Yeah.
- Oh, great. Can I see it?

1077
00:56:47,366 --> 00:56:48,367
Yes. But first...

1078
00:56:48,450 --> 00:56:52,246
Baby, do you mind? Could you just get me
a great big bucket of coffee?

1079
00:56:52,329 --> 00:56:54,790
Yeah, yeah. Anything for you.

1080
00:56:58,001 --> 00:56:59,169
You've been doing yoga?

1081
00:57:00,796 --> 00:57:02,548
No, I just like the pants.

1082
00:57:03,298 --> 00:57:04,424
Huh.

1083
00:57:09,304 --> 00:57:10,973
Quick, we're changing rooms!

1084
00:57:11,598 --> 00:57:13,517
Oh! Shit.

1085
00:57:15,352 --> 00:57:16,353

<i>If I had hesitated just one second,</i>

1087
00:57:21,024 --> 00:57:24,361
well, let's just say there's 170 souls
that are lucky I didn't.

1088
00:57:25,112 --> 00:57:26,238
And me.

1089
00:57:26,321 --> 00:57:27,656
So 171?

1090
00:57:27,739 --> 00:57:30,617
- Hey. Where have you guys been?
- Did you see Paul's here?

1091
00:57:30,701 --> 00:57:32,995
- He's literally standing right next to us.
- What's the plan?

1092
00:57:33,078 --> 00:57:36,456
Uh, I was thinking we could visit
the island of Nusa Penida.

1093
00:57:36,540 --> 00:57:38,959
- Best place on earth to watch a sunset.
- That sounds great.

1094
00:57:39,042 --> 00:57:43,547
Now, I've been reading in the guidebooks
about visiting the temple at Tanah Lot?

1095
00:57:43,630 --> 00:57:45,007
- I don't think that's...
- Cool.

1096
00:57:45,090 --> 00:57:48,886
Okay, why don't I get us some cabs? Okay?
Get us a couple of cabs.

1097
00:57:48,969 --> 00:57:50,804
I think Nusa Penida would be better.

1098
00:57:50,888 --> 00:57:53,307
We'll do that right after Tanah Lot.
Okay?

1099
00:57:54,892 --> 00:57:56,185
Hi!

1100
00:57:56,268 --> 00:57:59,271
Hey, do you know where Tanah Lot is?
It's a temple, apparently.

1101
00:57:59,897 --> 00:58:02,983
Here we go, guys.
Come on. Come on!

1102
00:58:22,836 --> 00:58:24,087
You okay?

1103
00:58:24,171 --> 00:58:25,380
We shouldn't be here.

1104
00:58:26,131 --> 00:58:28,800
Why? Looks amazing.

1105
00:58:30,010 --> 00:58:31,470
It's cursed.

1106
00:58:31,553 --> 00:58:34,556
Tradition says any unwed couple
that visits Tanah Lot

1107
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:36,517
will never have happiness in marriage.

1108
00:58:38,602 --> 00:58:40,354
Well, my dad couldn't have known that.

1109
00:58:41,647 --> 00:58:42,773
I'm sure you're right.

1110
00:58:43,982 --> 00:58:46,235
Well, hey, let's just go.

1111
00:58:47,528 --> 00:58:48,570
- You sure?
- Yeah.

1112
00:58:50,030 --> 00:58:52,533
But it would take a lot more
than a curse to mess us up.

1113
00:58:53,825 --> 00:58:55,702
Maybe other couples weren't so lucky.

1114
00:59:08,966 --> 00:59:11,093
Apparently, these are called
the snake caves.

1115
00:59:11,176 --> 00:59:13,595
Oh, my God.
It feels so good to get out of the sun.

1116
00:59:14,513 --> 00:59:16,557
Feel like my hangover has a hangover.

1117
00:59:20,435 --> 00:59:21,436
What are you doing?

1118
00:59:22,062 --> 00:59:23,146
Georgia?

1119
00:59:23,730 --> 00:59:24,690
Yes?

1120
00:59:24,773 --> 00:59:26,108
I love you.

1121
00:59:27,109 --> 00:59:30,654
You are gorgeous and kind.

1122
00:59:31,947 --> 00:59:33,323
Funny and smart.

1123
00:59:33,407 --> 00:59:35,117
You're everything I could ever want
and need.

1124
00:59:36,118 --> 00:59:37,119
Will you marry me?

1125
00:59:39,162 --> 00:59:40,163
Oh…

1126
00:59:40,247 --> 00:59:41,915
Whoa, Paul, I'm so...

1127
00:59:43,166 --> 00:59:44,376
I'm so touched and...

1128
00:59:45,210 --> 00:59:46,461
And nauseous right now.

1129
00:59:47,129 --> 00:59:48,297
Um…

1130
00:59:49,756 --> 00:59:51,383
Uh…

1131
00:59:51,466 --> 00:59:52,718
How do I put this?

1132
00:59:52,801 --> 00:59:54,011
Um, David...

1133
00:59:55,846 --> 00:59:57,973
David spent the night in my room
last night.

1134
00:59:59,183 --> 01:00:00,184
I'm sorry.

1135
01:00:06,148 --> 01:00:07,357
I know.

1136
01:00:07,441 --> 01:00:08,692
Oh.

1137
01:00:09,276 --> 01:00:12,321
Men don't wear yoga pants.
Even when they do yoga.

1138
01:00:12,404 --> 01:00:15,365
Oh, okay. I mean,
oh, my God, nothing happened.

1139
01:00:15,449 --> 01:00:17,701
It's not like that.
It would just never be like that.

1140
01:00:17,784 --> 01:00:19,328
- Stop it. Stop it.
- Okay? Okay.

1141
01:00:19,995 --> 01:00:22,164
- I trust you.
- Okay. Thank you.

1142
01:00:23,123 --> 01:00:24,291
Thank you.

1143
01:00:25,209 --> 01:00:26,210
I...

1144
01:00:27,794 --> 01:00:30,380
I trust you.

1145
01:00:30,464 --> 01:00:32,424
Yeah. Thank you.

1146
01:00:34,384 --> 01:00:35,802
Why are you being weird?

1147
01:00:35,886 --> 01:00:38,430
I think maybe I just got bit by something.

1148
01:00:38,514 --> 01:00:40,724
- Really?
- Oh, a snake!

1149
01:00:43,644 --> 01:00:45,103
Ah, that's no good.

1150
01:00:45,687 --> 01:00:47,773
Oh, shit.

1151
01:00:47,856 --> 01:00:49,900
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1152
01:00:49,983 --> 01:00:51,193
- It's wet.
- Where is it?

1153
01:00:51,276 --> 01:00:53,987
Oh, my God, there it is.
Um, what do we do?

1154
01:00:54,071 --> 01:00:56,073
- What do we do?
- Do something.

1155
01:00:56,156 --> 01:00:57,991
Okay. Um…

1156
01:00:58,075 --> 01:00:59,076
Anything.

1157
01:00:59,868 --> 01:01:01,161
Okay.

1158
01:01:08,544 --> 01:01:09,545
You're amazing.

1159
01:01:10,170 --> 01:01:12,506
I think... I think I got most of it.

1160
01:01:14,007 --> 01:01:15,634
I think I got most of it.

1161
01:01:17,761 --> 01:01:20,931
Well, he will experience
some numbness in his extremities

1162
01:01:21,014 --> 01:01:23,809
and a little wooziness
from the pills I just gave him,

1163
01:01:23,892 --> 01:01:25,811
but no lasting effect.

1164
01:01:25,894 --> 01:01:27,521
Not like getting bit by a dolphin.

1165
01:01:27,604 --> 01:01:28,605
All right.

1166
01:01:29,314 --> 01:01:30,607
You saved my life.

1167
01:01:31,733 --> 01:01:32,734
I really didn't.

1168
01:01:33,235 --> 01:01:35,904
We just heard.
What an adventure.

1169
01:01:36,655 --> 01:01:37,948
- Are you okay?
- I'm okay.

1170
01:01:38,532 --> 01:01:39,950
Thanks to my warrior queen.

1171
01:01:40,033 --> 01:01:42,411
- My Georgia.
- Okay.

1172
01:01:49,293 --> 01:01:51,336
- What are you talking about?
- Hmm?

1173
01:01:51,879 --> 01:01:52,880
Snakes.

1174
01:01:53,547 --> 01:01:54,798
Hmm.

1175
01:01:54,882 --> 01:01:56,008
We should let him sleep.

1176
01:01:56,091 --> 01:01:58,802
He's going to be fine,
but don't do that again.

1177
01:01:59,511 --> 01:02:01,096
- All right.
- Let's go.

1178
01:02:01,180 --> 01:02:02,431
- Okay.
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

1179
01:02:02,514 --> 01:02:06,018
We'll let you get some rest, okay?
But don't worry. I'll stay right here.

1180
01:02:06,101 --> 01:02:09,313
Oh, oh, oh. You remember
that important thing that I asked you?

1181
01:02:09,396 --> 01:02:10,898
Oh, yeah. Yep.

1182
01:02:12,065 --> 01:02:13,358
What did he ask you?

1183
01:02:14,276 --> 01:02:15,277
To marry him.

1184
01:02:17,196 --> 01:02:18,197
That's wonderful.

1185
01:02:18,280 --> 01:02:19,323
What?

1186
01:02:19,406 --> 01:02:21,408
Maybe not for everybody.

1187
01:02:21,491 --> 01:02:23,243
Sorry, I get that he's nice and all, but...

1188
01:02:23,327 --> 01:02:24,578
What's wrong with nice?

1189
01:02:25,662 --> 01:02:26,788
Uh…

1190
01:02:26,872 --> 01:02:30,042
Only that after a couple more years of it,
you'll be begging to watch paint dry.

1191
01:02:30,125 --> 01:02:31,418
Excuse me?

1192
01:02:31,502 --> 01:02:35,923
I mean, Mom, you're so amazing
and educated, tough, smart and beautiful.

1193
01:02:36,006 --> 01:02:38,342
But you're never your best self with him.

1194
01:02:38,425 --> 01:02:43,305
Yeah, he's kind and he's got those eyes.
But it's not enough.

1195
01:02:45,766 --> 01:02:48,310
Being loved is not the same as loving.

1196
01:02:50,062 --> 01:02:53,148
Plus, the whole surprising thing?

1197
01:02:54,066 --> 01:02:57,653
It's actually just a curtain
between us, so I heard all of that.

1198
01:03:18,298 --> 01:03:19,424
I feel bad.

1199
01:03:21,134 --> 01:03:23,387
Well, she didn't say she said yes.

1200
01:03:26,348 --> 01:03:27,808
How would you feel if she did?

1201
01:03:29,810 --> 01:03:33,355
Like hearing an old friend you barely
talk to anymore is getting married.

1202
01:03:34,064 --> 01:03:37,985
You're happy for them,
but you don't feel the need to buy a gift.

1203
01:03:40,320 --> 01:03:42,281
Since when were you guys old friends?

1204
01:03:44,741 --> 01:03:45,742
Ah…

1205
01:03:46,326 --> 01:03:48,036
That's the way it goes.

1206
01:03:48,120 --> 01:03:49,162
Stuff happens.

1207
01:03:50,455 --> 01:03:52,416
Things change and you move on.

1208
01:03:56,837 --> 01:03:58,005
Just move on.

1209
01:04:10,809 --> 01:04:13,812
She doesn't get to tell me what to do.
Can you believe it?

1210
01:04:13,896 --> 01:04:17,191
I'm sorry, baby. I'm a little woozy.
Am I supposed to believe it?

1211
01:04:17,274 --> 01:04:18,275
No.

1212
01:04:18,358 --> 01:04:19,735
No. Right, I can't.

1213
01:04:19,818 --> 01:04:22,529
- I know you're thinking I'm a hypocrite.
- Am I?

1214
01:04:22,613 --> 01:04:24,239
And you're probably right.

1215
01:04:24,323 --> 01:04:25,407
Oh, good.

1216
01:04:25,490 --> 01:04:29,036
I mean, who are we to say that
Lily doesn't know what's best for herself?

1217
01:04:29,119 --> 01:04:30,120
And if she does,

1218
01:04:30,204 --> 01:04:33,665
if she's truly definitively certain
that she loves and is loved, then...

1219
01:04:33,749 --> 01:04:35,751
Oh, David is with them.

1220
01:04:35,834 --> 01:04:37,419
David is with Gede and Lily now.

1221
01:04:37,503 --> 01:04:40,797
- Oh. Right, so he can break them up.
- No. I don't want him to break them up.

1222
01:04:40,881 --> 01:04:42,257
Damn this medication.

1223
01:04:43,550 --> 01:04:45,135
I have to do something.

1224
01:04:45,219 --> 01:04:46,261
Take this.

1225
01:04:48,597 --> 01:04:50,265
I'm sorry. This will help you sleep.

1226
01:04:51,767 --> 01:04:54,061
All right. Cool. Feel better.

1227
01:04:54,144 --> 01:04:56,897
You know,
I'm a highly trained commercial pilot.

1228
01:04:56,980 --> 01:04:59,024
I can go weeks without sleep.

1229
01:05:16,625 --> 01:05:18,377
The best place on earth.

1230
01:05:18,460 --> 01:05:22,589
Well, to be fair,
I haven't been to all the other places.

1231
01:05:22,673 --> 01:05:24,883
Your mother is gonna be so jealous.

1232
01:05:24,967 --> 01:05:27,594
I'll send her a picture
as soon as I get a signal.

1233
01:05:27,678 --> 01:05:28,679
No need.

1234
01:05:35,769 --> 01:05:36,770
Mom!

1235
01:05:37,479 --> 01:05:38,856
Hey.

1236
01:05:38,939 --> 01:05:42,526
Hey, I'm so sorry about before.
I guess I was just surprised.

1237
01:05:42,609 --> 01:05:44,319
Of course your choices
are your choices.

1238
01:05:44,403 --> 01:05:47,239
Well, I haven't made any choices yet.

1239
01:05:47,990 --> 01:05:48,991
Oh.

1240
01:05:50,284 --> 01:05:51,285
Okay.

1241
01:05:51,368 --> 01:05:52,995
- Hi, gents.
- Hey.

1242
01:05:53,078 --> 01:05:54,329
Is, uh, Paul okay?

1243
01:05:54,413 --> 01:05:55,539
He's sleeping.

1244
01:05:55,622 --> 01:05:56,623
How can you tell?

1245
01:05:57,624 --> 01:05:59,334
God, look at this view.

1246
01:06:01,003 --> 01:06:02,004
Yeah.

1247
01:06:05,007 --> 01:06:06,091
Is that my boat?

1248
01:06:08,760 --> 01:06:09,761
Is it drifting?

1249
01:06:11,263 --> 01:06:13,640
Nah, it's just rising with the tide.

1250
01:06:13,724 --> 01:06:14,808
It's floating away.

1251
01:06:14,892 --> 01:06:16,143
You did tie my boat up?

1252
01:06:16,226 --> 01:06:18,061
Yeah, I tied it. Tied it to a log.

1253
01:06:21,857 --> 01:06:23,150
That's not good.

1254
01:06:28,655 --> 01:06:30,574
How far are we
from the nearest village?

1255
01:06:30,657 --> 01:06:33,452
Too far to walk.
Plus, it's getting dark.

1256
01:06:33,535 --> 01:06:35,245
I still can't get a signal.

1257
01:06:35,787 --> 01:06:37,206
What are we gonna do?

1258
01:06:37,289 --> 01:06:39,166
Camp here for the night.

1259
01:06:39,249 --> 01:06:41,418
A lot of people come to see the sunrise,

1260
01:06:41,502 --> 01:06:43,754
so we can get a ride
in time for our wedding.

1261
01:06:43,837 --> 01:06:46,590
- Is that gonna work?
- Yeah, with hours to spare.

1262
01:06:47,382 --> 01:06:50,010
Uh, Georgia,
can you and Lily build a fire?

1263
01:06:50,093 --> 01:06:51,094
On it, yeah.

1264
01:06:51,178 --> 01:06:54,014
Mr. Cotton,
you and I will track down some food.

1265
01:06:54,097 --> 01:06:55,682
Hmm. What kind of food?

1266
01:06:55,766 --> 01:06:57,643
I've seen some wild pigs around.

1267
01:06:59,311 --> 01:07:01,271
We'll have to make spears.

1268
01:07:03,232 --> 01:07:05,526
What? I can hunt. I can be a hunter.

1269
01:07:05,609 --> 01:07:08,195
How do you make that part pointier?

1270
01:07:09,321 --> 01:07:12,074
- I am impressed with this situation…
- Yeah.

1271
01:07:12,157 --> 01:07:14,493
- …and I have, uh, matches in my bag.
- Okay.

1272
01:07:15,619 --> 01:07:19,164
You know, I don't think I've actually
successfully started a fire before.

1273
01:07:19,248 --> 01:07:21,667
Oh, really? What about
your eighth birthday, hmm?

1274
01:07:21,750 --> 01:07:24,378
Uh, well, never on purpose.

1275
01:07:24,461 --> 01:07:26,797
Oh, God,
we had some good parties.

1276
01:07:26,880 --> 01:07:28,423
Do you remember
your tenth birthday?

1277
01:07:28,507 --> 01:07:30,217
- The clown came and he was drunk?
- Mom?

1278
01:07:30,300 --> 01:07:32,553
- No, he was a magician. But he was...
- Mom.

1279
01:07:47,776 --> 01:07:49,778
All right. You're the closest.

1280
01:07:50,404 --> 01:07:52,239
I think it's closer to you than me.

1281
01:07:53,532 --> 01:07:54,575
Okay. Hey.

1282
01:07:55,784 --> 01:07:57,744
- On my count. Okay?
- Okay.

1283
01:07:58,662 --> 01:07:59,663
One…

1284
01:08:03,208 --> 01:08:04,877
Three.

1285
01:08:04,960 --> 01:08:06,920
Dad!

1286
01:08:07,880 --> 01:08:10,257
What are you doing?
We absolutely had it!

1287
01:08:10,340 --> 01:08:11,383
I cannot believe you.

1288
01:08:11,466 --> 01:08:13,927
- You're the one that scared it away.
- That's not what I'm talking about.

1289
01:08:14,011 --> 01:08:15,888
- What are you talking about?
- She found the rings.

1290
01:08:16,889 --> 01:08:17,890
Really?

1291
01:08:17,973 --> 01:08:19,183
That's great. Where?

1292
01:08:19,265 --> 01:08:20,392
In Mom's bag.

1293
01:08:21,185 --> 01:08:22,685
- I knew it.
- What?

1294
01:08:23,687 --> 01:08:25,856
- I knew it.
- She wasn't working alone because...

1295
01:08:26,857 --> 01:08:28,649
- Wait, what?
- You left it in the bag?

1296
01:08:28,734 --> 01:08:31,236
- What do you mean you knew?
- What was I to do with them?

1297
01:08:31,319 --> 01:08:33,113
- Throw it away.
- I'm sorry. I couldn't tell you.

1298
01:08:33,197 --> 01:08:34,406
- Where?
- In the trash, ocean, anywhere.

1299
01:08:34,488 --> 01:08:36,825
- Oh, my God.
- Can you stop talking about the rings?

1300
01:08:36,908 --> 01:08:38,202
I can't believe this is happening.

1301
01:08:38,285 --> 01:08:40,328
My parents have been
trying to sabotage my wedding.

1302
01:08:40,412 --> 01:08:42,331
My fiancé knew about it
and didn't bother to tell me.

1303
01:08:42,413 --> 01:08:43,916
We're just trying to do
what's best for you.

1304
01:08:43,999 --> 01:08:47,377
Yeah, but you had no respect
for my opinion of what that might be.

1305
01:08:49,587 --> 01:08:52,966
You're just like all parents,
acting like you're giving your kid

1306
01:08:53,050 --> 01:08:55,594
this great advice for their own good,
but all you're really doing

1307
01:08:55,676 --> 01:08:58,138
is talking to your young, dumb selves,
trying to rewrite the past

1308
01:08:58,221 --> 01:09:00,224
and not do whatever you did
25 years ago.

1309
01:09:00,307 --> 01:09:02,350
- That's absolutely not true.
- That's 100% true.

1310
01:09:04,102 --> 01:09:07,439
And I can't tell you
how much I wish

1311
01:09:07,523 --> 01:09:09,733
someone had been able to
get through to me back then.

1312
01:09:11,359 --> 01:09:13,862
Stop me from making
the greatest mistake of my life.

1313
01:09:17,282 --> 01:09:18,951
I'm the greatest mistake of your life?

1314
01:09:20,493 --> 01:09:22,621
Not you. Me.

1315
01:09:23,830 --> 01:09:24,915
I'm the mistake.

1316
01:09:30,504 --> 01:09:31,505
Hey.

1317
01:09:52,234 --> 01:09:53,569
Do you think we've lost her?

1318
01:09:56,238 --> 01:09:57,406
She's pretty pissed.

1319
01:10:01,702 --> 01:10:04,162
I'll talk to her.
I'll tell her it was my idea.

1320
01:10:05,455 --> 01:10:06,707
I talked you into it.

1321
01:10:08,333 --> 01:10:11,420
And if I'd listened to you,
we wouldn't have done it.

1322
01:10:12,629 --> 01:10:14,506
She'll be fine.

1323
01:10:21,471 --> 01:10:24,183
You weren't a mistake.

1324
01:10:25,684 --> 01:10:26,727
You weren't.

1325
01:10:28,228 --> 01:10:31,899
It's been the story for years that you
were the one to blame. It's not true.

1326
01:10:35,861 --> 01:10:40,282
I was loving being a mom.

1327
01:10:43,285 --> 01:10:47,789
But I started to feel like
I was losing who I was,

1328
01:10:47,873 --> 01:10:51,043
and I thought if I'd stayed with you,

1329
01:10:51,126 --> 01:10:55,464
maybe one day
I would not recognize myself at all.

1330
01:11:00,552 --> 01:11:02,054
That was the mistake.

1331
01:11:03,096 --> 01:11:04,097
Not you.

1332
01:11:16,401 --> 01:11:17,778
You should've told me.

1333
01:11:19,738 --> 01:11:22,699
Well, your dad thinks
you deserve better than me.

1334
01:11:23,742 --> 01:11:25,869
My dad thinks
I deserve better than anyone.

1335
01:11:26,495 --> 01:11:27,496
So do I.

1336
01:11:30,916 --> 01:11:34,336
You gave up a lot
to stay on this island.

1337
01:11:35,671 --> 01:11:37,256
And you know I understand that.

1338
01:11:39,675 --> 01:11:41,426
But what about me?

1339
01:11:42,886 --> 01:11:45,973
In a year from now,
ten years from now…

1340
01:11:48,100 --> 01:11:49,560
Will I still be enough for you?

1341
01:11:52,354 --> 01:11:53,480
Are you kidding me?

1342
01:11:57,484 --> 01:12:01,530
Hey, we're sitting here,
and there's a moon and a waterfall.

1343
01:12:01,613 --> 01:12:04,032
I'm in the most beautiful place
I've ever been in my life,

1344
01:12:04,116 --> 01:12:05,826
and all I can look at is you.

1345
01:12:09,371 --> 01:12:13,250
This isn't some summer thing
with a beginning and an end.

1346
01:12:15,752 --> 01:12:17,087
This is forever.

1347
01:12:49,036 --> 01:12:50,537
Morning.

1348
01:12:50,621 --> 01:12:51,622
Morning.

1349
01:12:51,705 --> 01:12:53,415
How'd you sleep?

1350
01:12:53,498 --> 01:12:55,459
You know. Outside.

1351
01:12:58,212 --> 01:13:00,881
I think this is
my new favorite place on earth.

1352
01:13:02,758 --> 01:13:04,176
Close second, for me.

1353
01:13:04,259 --> 01:13:06,553
Yeah? What beats it?

1354
01:13:08,138 --> 01:13:10,098
Hmm? Aw.

1355
01:13:10,182 --> 01:13:11,642
- Our place by the lake.
- Yeah.

1356
01:13:11,725 --> 01:13:12,726
Yeah.

1357
01:13:12,809 --> 01:13:14,520
I still go there from time to time.

1358
01:13:15,187 --> 01:13:16,313
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

1359
01:13:16,897 --> 01:13:20,734
God, what did they build there?
Please don't say some hideous McMansion.

1360
01:13:20,817 --> 01:13:22,528
Nah, it's still vacant.

1361
01:13:22,611 --> 01:13:23,654
Huh.

1362
01:13:23,737 --> 01:13:25,572
I wonder why nobody ever developed it.

1363
01:13:27,574 --> 01:13:28,909
'Cause I still own it.

1364
01:13:33,539 --> 01:13:34,706
I meant to sell it.

1365
01:13:36,333 --> 01:13:38,710
Took an offer once, but I couldn't do it.
I just...

1366
01:13:41,129 --> 01:13:42,214
I didn't want to.

1367
01:13:49,012 --> 01:13:50,013
You got a...

1368
01:13:50,097 --> 01:13:52,224
Yeah. An entire forest.

1369
01:14:20,377 --> 01:14:23,839
- Oh, no. No. No!
- No, no. No.

1370
01:14:23,922 --> 01:14:26,049
- Just... Yeah, that would not work.
- Nope. No, no.

1371
01:14:26,133 --> 01:14:28,177
- That's bad.
- That's not gonna work.

1372
01:14:28,260 --> 01:14:29,803
It's because we're
in this romantic place.

1373
01:14:29,887 --> 01:14:32,306
- No, the thing with Lily is just...
- Everything is heightened.

1374
01:14:32,389 --> 01:14:33,682
- Maybe if we were younger...
- We're not.

1375
01:14:33,765 --> 01:14:36,560
- Which we're not. We know better! Great!
- So, good, good, good.

1376
01:14:36,643 --> 01:14:38,312
- Good and great.
- Good and great. Hey, hey.

1377
01:14:38,395 --> 01:14:39,479
- Hey, hey.
- Give me your hand.

1378
01:14:39,563 --> 01:14:40,814
- What? Okay.
- Give me your hand.

1379
01:14:40,898 --> 01:14:42,107
Mom! Dad!

1380
01:14:42,191 --> 01:14:43,233
- Oh! Yes?
- Hey!

1381
01:14:43,317 --> 01:14:45,485
- We're your parents.
- Hi.

1382
01:14:45,569 --> 01:14:46,653
We got rides.

1383
01:14:48,822 --> 01:14:51,325
Well, well, well! Hello again.

1384
01:14:51,408 --> 01:14:53,410
Or should I say, "<i>Ciao</i>"?

1385
01:15:04,671 --> 01:15:08,008
♪ <i>Ooh, babe</i> ♪

1386
01:15:08,926 --> 01:15:10,636
♪ <i>I love you…</i> ♪

1387
01:15:20,896 --> 01:15:23,482
Thanks. Hey. Georgia. Hey.

1388
01:15:23,565 --> 01:15:24,650
Baby!

1389
01:15:25,859 --> 01:15:27,319
I was so worried.

1390
01:15:27,402 --> 01:15:30,656
Oh, we're fine. We're fine.
I just need the world's longest bath.

1391
01:15:30,739 --> 01:15:31,740
How are you?

1392
01:15:31,823 --> 01:15:35,077
You were right about getting some sleep.
I can almost move both my legs.

1393
01:15:35,160 --> 01:15:38,080
And look, one functioning arm.

1394
01:15:38,163 --> 01:15:40,374
- Where have you guys been?
- It's a long story. It's...

1395
01:15:40,457 --> 01:15:42,125
Our boat drifted out to sea.

1396
01:15:42,793 --> 01:15:44,711
That's not that long of a story.

1397
01:15:44,795 --> 01:15:47,005
Yeah, well, it felt like a long story
if you were there.

1398
01:15:47,089 --> 01:15:48,549
- Hey. Where are you going?
- Lily.

1399
01:15:49,424 --> 01:15:50,676
To Wren's room to get ready,

1400
01:15:50,759 --> 01:15:52,928
because this afternoon
I'm getting married.

1401
01:15:54,638 --> 01:15:57,558
You can either get on board with that
or have a nice flight home.

1402
01:15:58,559 --> 01:15:59,560
Lily.

1403
01:16:24,543 --> 01:16:25,544
Hey.

1404
01:16:26,420 --> 01:16:28,088
Your tuxedo, sir.

1405
01:16:33,260 --> 01:16:34,261
There.

1406
01:16:35,470 --> 01:16:36,471
Are you okay, sir?

1407
01:16:36,555 --> 01:16:39,641
Yeah. Everything is clearly terrific.

1408
01:16:54,990 --> 01:16:56,742
- Surprise!
- Oh!

1409
01:16:56,825 --> 01:16:57,910
Why would you do that?

1410
01:16:57,993 --> 01:16:59,286
- I got us brunch.
- Okay.

1411
01:16:59,953 --> 01:17:01,538
Oh, how long have you been out here?

1412
01:17:01,622 --> 01:17:02,623
Oh, not so long.

1413
01:17:03,957 --> 01:17:05,501
Oh, is it cold?

1414
01:17:06,293 --> 01:17:08,754
Oh, I wasn't sure how long
you would stay in the bath.

1415
01:17:08,837 --> 01:17:11,423
I'm going to be having
that panic attack all day.

1416
01:17:11,507 --> 01:17:13,258
Oh, eat something. Eat someth...

1417
01:17:13,342 --> 01:17:17,304
Well, maybe not the eggs.
They're a little congealed, but first…

1418
01:17:17,387 --> 01:17:18,680
What?

1419
01:17:20,390 --> 01:17:21,517
Take two!

1420
01:17:23,477 --> 01:17:24,728
- Georgia.
- Yes?

1421
01:17:26,813 --> 01:17:28,607
I... I love you.

1422
01:17:28,690 --> 01:17:31,652
You are gorgeous and kind...

1423
01:17:31,735 --> 01:17:33,987
- You don't have to kneel this time.
- You want me to stand?

1424
01:17:34,071 --> 01:17:35,697
Yeah, I do. I...

1425
01:17:35,781 --> 01:17:37,074
Oh, come on!

1426
01:17:37,157 --> 01:17:40,494
Are you okay? I'm s...
I'm gonna get you some ice.

1427
01:17:40,577 --> 01:17:42,120
No, I'm fine.

1428
01:17:42,204 --> 01:17:43,205
You're so brave.

1429
01:17:43,288 --> 01:17:44,581
God.

1430
01:17:45,249 --> 01:17:47,292
Oh, my God. It hurts.

1431
01:17:49,545 --> 01:17:50,921
Stop crying.

1432
01:17:51,880 --> 01:17:53,340
Why would I cry?

1433
01:17:54,132 --> 01:17:55,717
It's not like I'm losing someone

1434
01:17:55,801 --> 01:17:59,096
who's basically a substitute
for my entire terrible family.

1435
01:18:00,973 --> 01:18:02,182
Is my mascara okay?

1436
01:18:03,183 --> 01:18:06,645
Uh, for a clown. Let me help.

1437
01:18:08,689 --> 01:18:11,024
Do you remember when we graduated?

1438
01:18:11,108 --> 01:18:13,819
Yes, because it was two months ago.

1439
01:18:13,902 --> 01:18:15,279
Oh…

1440
01:18:18,115 --> 01:18:22,160
Mrs. C? You're gonna have
to take it from here.

1441
01:18:22,244 --> 01:18:23,328
I just can't.

1442
01:18:30,002 --> 01:18:31,128
Hi.

1443
01:18:31,879 --> 01:18:32,880
Hi.

1444
01:18:41,388 --> 01:18:42,389
May I?

1445
01:18:50,439 --> 01:18:51,773
You lied to me.

1446
01:18:56,028 --> 01:18:57,863
I'm so, so sorry.

1447
01:18:59,823 --> 01:19:03,535
It turns out a parent will do
anything in the world for their kid,

1448
01:19:03,619 --> 01:19:05,662
except let them be
exactly who they are.

1449
01:19:08,498 --> 01:19:10,834
Your dad and I
were gonna be different.

1450
01:19:13,712 --> 01:19:15,714
We were gonna be better than this.

1451
01:19:18,091 --> 01:19:20,010
I wanted to be better than this.

1452
01:19:25,849 --> 01:19:27,476
There's no one better, Mom.

1453
01:19:30,312 --> 01:19:31,355
No one.

1454
01:19:32,940 --> 01:19:34,358
Yes, there is.

1455
01:19:43,450 --> 01:19:45,327
Sweetie. Love you.

1456
01:19:53,085 --> 01:19:54,878
Got to get you ready
for that wedding, huh?

1457
01:19:54,962 --> 01:19:56,213
Yeah.

1458
01:19:56,296 --> 01:19:59,007
- You're kind of a mess right now.
- I know, Mom.

1459
01:20:03,095 --> 01:20:04,888
You're a mess. You're my mess.

1460
01:21:11,955 --> 01:21:14,750
Can you believe I didn't
bring anything to wear to a wedding?

1461
01:21:14,833 --> 01:21:16,710
There wasn't supposed to be a wedding.

1462
01:21:18,545 --> 01:21:19,880
Doesn't look like a rental.

1463
01:21:21,882 --> 01:21:23,300
You clean up pretty good.

1464
01:21:32,267 --> 01:21:33,268
Okay.

1465
01:21:48,659 --> 01:21:50,118
Wow.

1466
01:21:51,578 --> 01:21:52,704
Look at our girl.

1467
01:21:52,788 --> 01:21:53,789
And free!

1468
01:21:53,872 --> 01:21:57,584
So young, so free, so sweaty.

1469
01:21:58,585 --> 01:21:59,628
So sweaty.

1470
01:22:00,546 --> 01:22:01,547
Yeah.

1471
01:23:23,629 --> 01:23:24,796
She is good.

1472
01:24:13,303 --> 01:24:17,140
And now for the final part
of the ceremony.

1473
01:24:17,224 --> 01:24:18,350
Thank you so much.

1474
01:24:18,433 --> 01:24:23,188
Gede will take the knife
and strike it through this pandanus,

1475
01:24:23,897 --> 01:24:29,444
to show he and Lily
will be ready to live together.

1476
01:24:54,386 --> 01:24:58,265
Right place, right time,
right circumstance.

1477
01:25:00,350 --> 01:25:02,436
Sorry, but we don't have all three.

1478
01:25:05,147 --> 01:25:07,191
Georgia. Mr. Cotton.

1479
01:25:08,442 --> 01:25:10,944
We needed your support, your blessing.

1480
01:25:12,446 --> 01:25:13,530
And we don't have it.

1481
01:25:16,158 --> 01:25:17,993
When I push this knife through this mat,

1482
01:25:18,785 --> 01:25:20,287
it is a declaration that…

1483
01:25:21,455 --> 01:25:25,417
This poem of a person and me
are now a family.

1484
01:25:27,878 --> 01:25:29,630
We can't be a family without you.

1485
01:25:31,924 --> 01:25:33,050
So I ask you.

1486
01:25:33,133 --> 01:25:34,134
Please.

1487
01:25:35,511 --> 01:25:36,512
For Lily and me.

1488
01:25:38,013 --> 01:25:40,974
Or we will not marry.

1489
01:25:42,351 --> 01:25:44,603
You didn't wanna run that by me first?

1490
01:25:51,568 --> 01:25:53,403
You can do the hard stuff too.

1491
01:25:57,991 --> 01:25:59,076
Um…

1492
01:26:00,577 --> 01:26:01,995
You don't need our blessing.

1493
01:26:03,038 --> 01:26:05,832
I mean, you have it. It's here, but…

1494
01:26:09,294 --> 01:26:11,505
All you two really need is each other.

1495
01:26:16,260 --> 01:26:20,681
If your mother and I had listened to
her awful parents or my dumb-ass friends,

1496
01:26:20,764 --> 01:26:23,267
then Lily wouldn't be here at all.

1497
01:26:23,350 --> 01:26:24,977
And I think we can all agree that…

1498
01:26:26,228 --> 01:26:29,273
The world's a lot better place
with Lily in it.

1499
01:26:30,065 --> 01:26:32,276
So, I…

1500
01:26:35,737 --> 01:26:37,114
- Yeah?
- Mmm.

1501
01:26:40,993 --> 01:26:42,828
Your mother and I are on your side.

1502
01:26:43,996 --> 01:26:45,038
Both of you.

1503
01:26:46,290 --> 01:26:47,291
Now and always.

1504
01:26:48,750 --> 01:26:49,751
Yeah.

1505
01:27:00,554 --> 01:27:01,555
Shall we?

1506
01:27:09,396 --> 01:27:11,523
Wait!

1507
01:27:11,607 --> 01:27:12,608
What?

1508
01:27:14,735 --> 01:27:16,403
I'm just kidding.
Go for it.

1509
01:27:20,199 --> 01:27:21,408
That's my daughter.

1510
01:27:44,556 --> 01:27:47,100
Do you think if we'd
kicked a coconut around a few times,

1511
01:27:47,184 --> 01:27:49,353
things would have
worked out differently for us?

1512
01:27:51,188 --> 01:27:54,358
I'm sure some red and white string
couldn't have hurt.

1513
01:27:58,904 --> 01:28:00,531
Paul proposed.

1514
01:28:00,614 --> 01:28:01,907
I know.

1515
01:28:03,075 --> 01:28:05,160
This morning,
he... he re-proposed.

1516
01:28:06,954 --> 01:28:08,163
What did you say?

1517
01:28:09,289 --> 01:28:12,417
I asked him for some ice
because he headbutted me.

1518
01:28:12,501 --> 01:28:13,669
Hmm.

1519
01:28:15,170 --> 01:28:17,422
A lot of guys would have
gone in for a kiss at that point.

1520
01:28:19,383 --> 01:28:20,759
Let me see your nose.

1521
01:28:21,677 --> 01:28:22,678
Let's see.

1522
01:28:22,761 --> 01:28:23,929
Mmm.

1523
01:28:27,641 --> 01:28:28,934
I think you should say yes.

1524
01:28:35,065 --> 01:28:36,066
Paul's a good guy.

1525
01:28:36,149 --> 01:28:37,234
Mm-hmm.

1526
01:28:38,610 --> 01:28:42,364
And if he makes you half as happy

1527
01:28:42,447 --> 01:28:44,449
as we were when we were happy…

1528
01:28:48,704 --> 01:28:49,997
Then you should say yes.

1529
01:28:53,208 --> 01:28:54,209
I don't know.

1530
01:28:56,628 --> 01:28:59,715
Maybe I'm too old to feel young anymore.

1531
01:29:01,341 --> 01:29:04,595
I think I missed something critical
and now it's too late.

1532
01:29:07,014 --> 01:29:08,015
Well…

1533
01:29:09,725 --> 01:29:11,643
You look like you're in your prime to me.

1534
01:29:17,065 --> 01:29:18,609
Even with that crooked nose.

1535
01:29:36,710 --> 01:29:38,337
- Hi.
- Hi.

1536
01:29:57,898 --> 01:29:59,274
What are you doing out here?

1537
01:30:00,651 --> 01:30:02,236
Just looking at this garbage.

1538
01:30:03,529 --> 01:30:04,863
You call that a sunset?

1539
01:30:20,838 --> 01:30:22,256
I belong here.

1540
01:30:25,717 --> 01:30:26,718
I know.

1541
01:30:37,855 --> 01:30:39,439
Will you come and dance with me?

1542
01:30:46,238 --> 01:30:47,489
Let's go dance.

1543
01:31:01,795 --> 01:31:04,381
Wow, it's so quiet.

1544
01:31:08,719 --> 01:31:10,137
- Hi.
- Hi.

1545
01:31:12,514 --> 01:31:14,057
- Did I wake you?
- No.

1546
01:31:14,766 --> 01:31:16,435
- Was I kicking? I was kicking.
- No, no, no.

1547
01:31:16,518 --> 01:31:18,604
- No, you weren't. You weren't. I was up.
- Okay.

1548
01:31:22,149 --> 01:31:23,734
Um…

1549
01:31:24,359 --> 01:31:26,528
Well, the ferry is only
leaving this afternoon.

1550
01:31:26,612 --> 01:31:28,405
I guess we could go paddle boarding.

1551
01:31:31,158 --> 01:31:32,868
I can't marry you, Paul.

1552
01:31:35,495 --> 01:31:37,331
It doesn't have to be
paddle boarding.

1553
01:31:38,749 --> 01:31:39,833
Uh…

1554
01:31:40,542 --> 01:31:41,793
Did I do something wrong?

1555
01:31:41,877 --> 01:31:43,795
No. No, it's just...

1556
01:31:43,879 --> 01:31:47,758
It's the wrong time, wrong place,

1557
01:31:49,134 --> 01:31:50,219
wrong girl.

1558
01:31:52,596 --> 01:31:53,764
I'm so sorry.

1559
01:32:00,145 --> 01:32:01,146
Me too.

1560
01:32:03,023 --> 01:32:04,983
I'm not just agreeing to agree with you.

1561
01:32:12,074 --> 01:32:13,784
I'm still gonna go paddle boarding.

1562
01:32:27,130 --> 01:32:28,131
Get it!

1563
01:32:29,633 --> 01:32:30,634
Kick it!

1564
01:32:49,152 --> 01:32:51,363
Kick it! Kick it.

1565
01:33:00,247 --> 01:33:02,165
Hold it up! Hold it up! Hold it up!

1566
01:33:02,249 --> 01:33:03,959
No!

1567
01:33:04,042 --> 01:33:05,460
Come on. More.

1568
01:33:06,086 --> 01:33:07,087
More!

1569
01:33:08,714 --> 01:33:11,884
Oh, fudge! Now it's going. Now it's go...

1570
01:33:12,634 --> 01:33:14,303
It's going! It's going!

1571
01:33:16,513 --> 01:33:17,764
Whoa!

1572
01:33:25,606 --> 01:33:26,607
Where's Paul?

1573
01:33:27,524 --> 01:33:29,985
He had a last-minute hop to Hanoi.

1574
01:33:30,068 --> 01:33:31,528
Uh, he said to say bye.

1575
01:33:32,863 --> 01:33:35,240
I told him
it wasn't gonna work out for me.

1576
01:33:35,324 --> 01:33:36,325
For him.

1577
01:33:36,408 --> 01:33:37,659
For me and him.

1578
01:33:38,785 --> 01:33:40,037
I said it better than that.

1579
01:33:41,872 --> 01:33:42,873
Oh, Mom.

1580
01:33:43,540 --> 01:33:44,625
I'm sorry.

1581
01:33:45,542 --> 01:33:47,503
Can we make this
a little more about me?

1582
01:33:48,921 --> 01:33:50,130
Of course.

1583
01:33:52,007 --> 01:33:54,301
What am I gonna do without you?

1584
01:33:58,847 --> 01:34:00,224
I want you to have these.

1585
01:34:01,600 --> 01:34:03,268
I was fine with you getting married,

1586
01:34:03,352 --> 01:34:05,187
but I'm way too young and gorgeous

1587
01:34:05,270 --> 01:34:06,897
to be an aunt.

1588
01:34:12,986 --> 01:34:14,696
- Hey.
- Hey.

1589
01:34:16,281 --> 01:34:17,616
All right. All right, kiddo.

1590
01:34:18,951 --> 01:34:19,952
Okay.

1591
01:34:21,453 --> 01:34:24,998
- Dad.
- Oh, no. No crying.

1592
01:34:28,418 --> 01:34:30,087
Okay. I love you.

1593
01:34:35,551 --> 01:34:36,635
And I love you.

1594
01:34:39,346 --> 01:34:40,347
All right.

1595
01:34:44,810 --> 01:34:46,061
- All right.
- Bye.

1596
01:34:46,144 --> 01:34:47,646
You take care of yourself.

1597
01:34:47,729 --> 01:34:48,730
You too.

1598
01:34:53,986 --> 01:34:55,195
I love you.

1599
01:35:02,703 --> 01:35:03,954
I super love you.

1600
01:35:38,322 --> 01:35:39,823
Sorry about Paul.

1601
01:35:41,575 --> 01:35:43,285
- No, you're not.
- Not really.

1602
01:35:48,165 --> 01:35:49,166
I'm gonna miss her.

1603
01:35:49,249 --> 01:35:50,542
Yeah.

1604
01:35:53,128 --> 01:35:54,880
I see why she likes it here.

1605
01:35:56,131 --> 01:35:57,466
Yeah, it's good.

1606
01:35:59,343 --> 01:36:01,553
I could see spending some time here.

1607
01:36:02,554 --> 01:36:03,555
Someday.

1608
01:36:14,525 --> 01:36:16,401
Why save the good stuff for later?

1609
01:36:17,444 --> 01:36:19,238
Yeah.

1610
01:36:33,126 --> 01:36:34,253
What?

1611
01:36:48,433 --> 01:36:49,935
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1612
01:37:24,511 --> 01:37:27,890
I won't let her throw her life away
on some insanely handsome guy

1613
01:37:27,973 --> 01:37:30,350
who happens to live
in the most beautiful place on earth.

1614
01:37:30,434 --> 01:37:32,853
And yes, I do know how that sounds,
but I'm still right.

1615
01:37:33,520 --> 01:37:34,688
Cut!

1616
01:37:34,771 --> 01:37:35,981
We got action.

I knew I was getting set up.

1635
01:38:40,003 --> 01:38:42,506
Okay, wait. I have to take a picture.
