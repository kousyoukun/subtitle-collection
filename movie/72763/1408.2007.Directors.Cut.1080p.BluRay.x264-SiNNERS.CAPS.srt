1
00:00:43,192 --> 00:00:46,127
RECKLESS SINFUL
WAY THROUGHOUT THIS LIFE.

2
00:00:46,128 --> 00:00:47,596
THE LORD HAS TOLD ME

3
00:00:47,597 --> 00:00:49,931
THAT THE OPEN GATES OF HELL

4
00:00:49,932 --> 00:00:52,667
ARE YAWNING UP
WIDELY IN OUR PATH.

5
00:00:52,668 --> 00:00:54,569
YES, THE FLAMES

6
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:56,705
OF PERPETUAL DAMNATION

7
00:00:56,706 --> 00:00:59,708
ARE EVER READY TO GRASP
OUR SOULS.

8
00:00:59,709 --> 00:01:02,877
WE KNOW THE WAY
OF THE RIGHTEOUS MAN.

9
00:01:02,878 --> 00:01:04,980
YEAH, WE KNOW THE PRAYER

10
00:01:04,981 --> 00:01:06,942
OF THE RIGHTEOUS MAN.

11
00:01:15,925 --> 00:01:19,227
I'M TELLING YOU
THAT THE LORD HAS SPOKEN.

12
00:01:19,228 --> 00:01:22,656
YES, THE LORD HAS SPOKEN TO ME.

13
00:01:46,522 --> 00:01:48,323
HI.

14
00:01:48,324 --> 00:01:50,425
MIKE ENSLIN.
CHECKING IN.

15
00:01:50,426 --> 00:01:52,994
HONEY.
MR. ENSLIN.

16
00:01:52,995 --> 00:01:54,596
WE WERE AFRAID YOU
WEREN'T GOING TO SHOW.

17
00:01:54,597 --> 00:01:57,332
OH IT'S SUCH AN HONOR
TO HAVE YOU HERE.

18
00:01:57,333 --> 00:01:59,234
TERRIBLE NIGHT OUT THERE.
IF I COULD JUST GET THE KEY,

19
00:01:59,235 --> 00:02:00,969
I'LL SETTLE IN AND WE CAN
TALK IN THE MORNING AFTER...

20
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:03,104
YOU PROBABLY WANT TO HEAR
ALL ABOUT OUR HAUNTED HISTORY.

21
00:02:03,105 --> 00:02:05,440
WELL, THIS STAIRCASE HERE,
THIS IS WHERE THE MAID

22
00:02:05,441 --> 00:02:07,776
REPUTEDLY HUNG HERSELF IN 1860.

23
00:02:07,777 --> 00:02:09,244
OH.
THERE'S A PICTURE!

24
00:02:09,245 --> 00:02:10,779
CAN WE DO THIS IN THE MORNING?
WAIT WAIT.

25
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:12,681
IT'S PRINTED IN OUR BROCHURE.

26
00:02:12,682 --> 00:02:14,215
DID WE SEND YOU ONE OF THESE?
UH, PROBABLY DID.

27
00:02:14,216 --> 00:02:16,951
DO YOU SEE HER IN THE WINDOW?
YEAH, THERE SHE IS.

28
00:02:16,952 --> 00:02:19,988
THAT'S A PHOTO THAT
A GUEST TOOK IN 1986.

29
00:02:19,989 --> 00:02:21,990
IN YOUR LETTER
YOU MENTIONED THAT THE ROOMS

30
00:02:21,991 --> 00:02:23,992
WITH THE MOST
PARANORMAL ACTIVITY

31
00:02:23,993 --> 00:02:26,061
WERE IN THE ATTIC.
COULD I HAVE ONE OF THOSE ROOMS?

32
00:02:26,062 --> 00:02:28,563
THAT'S RIGHT, BECAUSE THE ATTIC
IS ON THE THIRD FLOOR

33
00:02:28,564 --> 00:02:30,732
WHICH IS THE FORMER
SERVANT'S QUARTERS.

34
00:02:30,733 --> 00:02:33,201
PEOPLE SAY THAT ALL
OF SYLVIA'S CHILDREN

35
00:02:33,202 --> 00:02:36,104
DIED UP THERE OF TUBERCULOSIS.

36
00:02:36,105 --> 00:02:38,973
ALL OF THEM?
GUESTS HAVE REPORTED STRANGE SOUNDS.

37
00:02:38,974 --> 00:02:41,609
AT THE STROKE OF MIDNIGHT
THERE'S BEEN WEIRD NOISES.

38
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:44,279
NOW OUR BEST ADVICE
IS TO LOCK YOUR DOOR FROM THE INSIDE.

39
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,980
ISN'T THAT RIGHT, HONEY?
THAT'S RIGHT.

40
00:02:45,981 --> 00:02:48,583
YOU TAKE CARE, YOU JUST
LOCK IT FROM THE INSIDE.

41
00:02:48,584 --> 00:02:50,351
I WILL.

42
00:02:50,352 --> 00:02:52,483
AS SOON AS YOU GIVE ME THE KEY.

43
00:02:55,391 --> 00:02:57,792
I'M SO... RIGHT.
GOT IT RIGHT HERE.

44
00:02:57,793 --> 00:03:00,729
NUMBER 14, YOU CAN'T MISS IT.
BEEN A LONG DRIVE.

45
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:02,731
GOOD LUCK.
ALL RIGHT, WE'LL SEE

46
00:03:02,732 --> 00:03:05,159
WHAT THE NIGHT BRINGS.

47
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:18,573
MRS. CLARK, THE PROPRIETOR,

48
00:04:18,574 --> 00:04:20,275
SAYS SHE HASN'T SLEPT A NIGHT

49
00:04:20,276 --> 00:04:23,144
SINCE ACQUIRING THE INN
AND I BELIEVE HER.

50
00:04:23,145 --> 00:04:25,513
NO NO NO, I PITY HER.

51
00:04:25,514 --> 00:04:28,216
BUT IN ANY CASE, THE EGGS
BENEDICT ARE DELICIOUS

52
00:04:28,217 --> 00:04:30,385
AND IF YOU CALL IN ADVANCE,
MRS. CLARK SAYS

53
00:04:30,386 --> 00:04:33,988
SHE WILL BAKE HER FAMOUS
FLOUR-LESS CHOCOLATE CAKE.

54
00:04:33,989 --> 00:04:38,282
ON A SHIVER SCALE, I AWARD THE WEEPING
BEACH INN SIX SKULLS.

55
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:43,422
SCREW 'EM, FIVE SKULLS.

56
00:04:55,077 --> 00:04:57,412
HI.
OH HEY.

57
00:04:57,413 --> 00:05:00,114
HOW'S IT GOING?
CAN I HELP YOU?

58
00:05:00,115 --> 00:05:01,583
YEAH, I'M HERE
FOR THE BIG EVENT.

59
00:05:01,584 --> 00:05:05,386
ALL RIGHT.
COOL.

60
00:05:05,387 --> 00:05:06,754
I'M MIKE ENSLIN.

61
00:05:06,755 --> 00:05:09,148
SORRY?

62
00:05:10,226 --> 00:05:11,626
BOOK SIGNING.
OH, RIGHT.

63
00:05:11,627 --> 00:05:15,129
OH, THAT'S YOU, YEAH.
I SEE THE RESEMBLANCE, YEAH.

64
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:17,232
THAT'S A GOOD PICTURE.
THANKS, MAN.

65
00:05:17,233 --> 00:05:18,833
ALL RIGHT, HOLD ON.

66
00:05:18,834 --> 00:05:22,003
UM... ATTENTION,
BOOK LOVERS.

67
00:05:22,004 --> 00:05:25,506
TONIGHT WE HAVE NOTED
OCCULT WRITER

68
00:05:25,507 --> 00:05:27,375
MICHAEL ENSLIN

69
00:05:27,376 --> 00:05:30,144
AT THE AUTHOR'S CORNER TONIGHT.

70
00:05:30,145 --> 00:05:33,448
HE'S THE WRITER OF THE BEST-SELLING
GHOST SURVIVAL GUIDES,

71
00:05:33,449 --> 00:05:36,818
UM... WITH SUCH TITLES
AS "10 HAUNTED HOTELS,"

72
00:05:36,819 --> 00:05:39,988
"10 HAUNTED GRAVEYARDS,"

73
00:05:39,989 --> 00:05:41,589
"10 HAUNTED LIGHTHOUSES."

74
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:44,058
THAT'S TONIGHT, 7:00 PM.

75
00:05:44,059 --> 00:05:46,361
ANYWAY, SO I REALLY
ENJOYED WRITING IT,

76
00:05:46,362 --> 00:05:48,329
AND THAT'S KIND OF
A HISTORY OF THE BOOK.

77
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:51,466
AND I HOPE YOU ENJOY IT,
OR ENJOYED IT.

78
00:05:51,467 --> 00:05:54,002
UH, YOU KNOW, STAY SCARED.

79
00:05:54,003 --> 00:05:55,436
RIGHT?
ANY QUESTIONS?

80
00:05:55,437 --> 00:05:57,772
WHERE'S THE SCARIEST PLACE
YOU'VE EVER BEEN?

81
00:05:57,773 --> 00:05:59,941
SCARIEST PLACE I'VE EVER BEEN?

82
00:05:59,942 --> 00:06:01,976
UH, I'VE NEVER HEARD
THAT QUESTION BEFORE.

83
00:06:01,977 --> 00:06:04,212
THAT'S A JOKE.

84
00:06:04,213 --> 00:06:06,581
WELL, ALL THESE PLACES HAVE
VERY COLORFUL HISTORIES.

85
00:06:06,582 --> 00:06:08,182
UM...

86
00:06:08,183 --> 00:06:10,318
I WOULD SAY, IF I HAD TO
PICK A TOP ONE,

87
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:12,353
I WOULD SAY BAR HARBOR,

88
00:06:12,354 --> 00:06:15,423
THE SITE OF THE GRISLY
MCTEIG WEDDING NIGHT MURDERS.

89
00:06:15,424 --> 00:06:18,159
THAT'S AN INTENSE PLACE.
OR MAYBE ST. CLOUD, MINNESOTA,

90
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,095
WHERE THE CRAZED WAR WIDOW
THREW HER BABY DOWN A WELL.

91
00:06:21,096 --> 00:06:23,464
I MEAN, THOSE ALL HAVE A LOT
OF... I MEAN, IT'S THICK.

92
00:06:23,465 --> 00:06:26,301
THE AIR IS THICK.
WHAT ABOUT POLTERGEISTS?

93
00:06:26,302 --> 00:06:29,203
LOOK, I'M A GOOD RESEARCHER.
I GO INTO EVERY GIG LOCKED AND LOADED.

94
00:06:29,204 --> 00:06:32,473
I TRAVEL WITH AN EMF METER,
FULL-RANGE SPECTROMETER,

95
00:06:32,474 --> 00:06:35,209
INFRARED CAMERA. I MEAN, LOOK,
NOTHING WOULD MAKE ME HAPPIER

96
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:37,178
THAN TO EXPERIENCE
A PARANORMAL EVENT,

97
00:06:37,179 --> 00:06:39,948
YOU KNOW, TO GET A GLIMPSE
OF THE ELUSIVE LIGHT

98
00:06:39,949 --> 00:06:41,614
AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL.

99
00:06:43,218 --> 00:06:45,816
SO YOU'RE SAYING THERE'S
NO SUCH THING AS GHOSTS?

100
00:06:46,655 --> 00:06:48,356
I'M SAYING I'VE NEVER SEEN ONE,

101
00:06:48,357 --> 00:06:50,758
BUT THEY'RE AWFUL CONVENIENT
FOR DESPERATE HOTELS

102
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:52,994
WHEN THE INTERSTATE MOVES AWAY.

103
00:06:52,995 --> 00:06:55,730
THIS THING HAS REALLY
GONE OFF THE RAILS. WHO HAS A PEN?

104
00:06:55,731 --> 00:06:58,333
I DO.
WHICH ONE?

105
00:06:58,334 --> 00:07:01,602
UH, BUT SERIOUSLY, MIKE,
IF I WANT TO SEE A REAL LIVE GHOST,

106
00:07:01,603 --> 00:07:03,404
WHERE'S MY BEST BET?

107
00:07:03,405 --> 00:07:04,739
GUARANTEED?
YEAH.

108
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:06,341
HAUNTED MANSION, ORLANDO.

109
00:07:06,342 --> 00:07:08,837
AWESOME, THANKS.

110
00:07:09,545 --> 00:07:11,179
STAY SCARED.
THANK YOU.

111
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:13,047
HEY, RAY, CAN YOU LOCK UP?

112
00:07:13,048 --> 00:07:16,017
I GOT BAND PRACTICE TONIGHT.

113
00:07:16,018 --> 00:07:17,685
HOLY SHIT.

114
00:07:17,686 --> 00:07:19,220
WHAT ROCK DID YOU
FIND THAT UNDER?

115
00:07:19,221 --> 00:07:21,289
UM, EBAY.
EBAY, HUH?

116
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:23,358
HOW MUCH DID IT GO FOR?

117
00:07:23,359 --> 00:07:25,927
WELL, THERE WEREN'T
MANY BIDDERS.

118
00:07:25,928 --> 00:07:28,396
I WOULD THINK NOT.

119
00:07:28,397 --> 00:07:31,399
WOW.
BUT IT'S, UM...

120
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,167
AN AMAZING BOOK.
OH.

121
00:07:33,168 --> 00:07:35,970
UM, SO... UNIQUE

122
00:07:35,971 --> 00:07:38,940
AND INSPIRATIONAL AND HONEST.

123
00:07:38,941 --> 00:07:40,675
THANKS.
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

124
00:07:40,676 --> 00:07:42,744
UM, ANNA.
OKAY, ANNA.

125
00:07:42,745 --> 00:07:44,879
ARE YOU GONNA WRITE ANOTHER
ONE LIKE THIS ONE?

126
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,748
NAH, IT'S A DIFFERENT GUY.

127
00:07:46,749 --> 00:07:48,750
UM...

128
00:07:48,751 --> 00:07:50,752
CAN I ASK YOU A QUESTION?
SURE.

129
00:07:50,753 --> 00:07:54,122
UM, THE RELATIONSHIP IN THE BOOK

130
00:07:54,123 --> 00:07:56,858
WITH THE FATHER AND THE SON...
IT'S PROBABLY TOO PERSONAL,

131
00:07:56,859 --> 00:08:00,495
BUT, UM, IT'S SO AUTHENTIC AND...
MM-HM.

132
00:08:00,496 --> 00:08:03,097
WELL-CONSTRUCTED,
AND...

133
00:08:03,098 --> 00:08:06,034
IS IT TRUE?

134
00:08:06,035 --> 00:08:08,703
NO.

135
00:08:08,704 --> 00:08:10,905
WELL, THANK YOU FOR THIS.
I REALLY APPRECIATE IT.

136
00:08:10,906 --> 00:08:12,306
MY PLEASURE.

137
00:08:12,307 --> 00:08:14,165
BYE.

138
00:08:30,325 --> 00:08:32,794
GOOD BOY!
YO, HOMEY...

139
00:08:32,795 --> 00:08:34,962
JUST A MINUTE, TIFFANY!

140
00:08:34,963 --> 00:08:37,527
YEAH, I'M JUST GONNA TIE IT
INSIDE MY SUIT HERE.

141
00:09:35,924 --> 00:09:37,959
YO, GREG, CHECK HIM OUT!

142
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,727
DID YOU SEE WHAT HAPPENED?

143
00:09:39,728 --> 00:09:41,893
OH YEAH.

144
00:09:42,965 --> 00:09:45,500
ARE YOU OKAY, BUDDY?

145
00:09:45,501 --> 00:09:48,793
HEY, ARE YOU BREATHING?

146
00:09:53,041 --> 00:09:55,605
NO!
SERIOUS AS A HEART ATTACK.

147
00:10:00,983 --> 00:10:05,686
WE GOT 325.
THAT IS BACK HERE, I THINK.

148
00:10:05,687 --> 00:10:07,488
UH-HUH.

149
00:10:07,489 --> 00:10:10,324
THIS IS THE ONE.
SIGN ON THE LINE, PLEASE, SIR.

150
00:10:10,325 --> 00:10:11,926
OH, YOU MEAN RIGHT HERE?

151
00:10:11,927 --> 00:10:14,795
HAVE YOURSELF A BEAUTIFUL DAY.
THANK YOU.

152
00:10:14,796 --> 00:10:17,098
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
HEY, MAN, YOU'VE BEEN GONE A WHILE.

153
00:10:17,099 --> 00:10:19,433
HEY, JACKSON, WHAT'S UP?
OH BY THE WAY, DUDE,

154
00:10:19,434 --> 00:10:22,436
I READ YOUR LAST BOOK...
THE "10 HAUNTED MANSIONS" THING.

155
00:10:22,437 --> 00:10:24,071
MAN, THAT'S SOME SCARY SHIT.

156
00:10:24,072 --> 00:10:26,407
COOL.

157
00:10:26,408 --> 00:10:28,335
LATER ON, DUDE.

158
00:10:31,847 --> 00:10:33,481
HI.
HI, HOW YOU DOING?

159
00:10:33,482 --> 00:10:35,683
HI.
GOOD.

160
00:10:35,684 --> 00:10:37,815
THANKS.

161
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:26,234
THAT'S CUTE.

162
00:11:26,235 --> 00:11:29,470
GOOD EVENING, DOLPHIN HOTEL.

163
00:11:29,471 --> 00:11:31,038
HOW MIGHT I DIRECT YOUR CALL?

164
00:11:31,039 --> 00:11:32,940
YEAH, HI, I'M CALLING ABOUT ROOM 1408.

165
00:11:32,941 --> 00:11:35,004
ONE MOMENT PLEASE, SIR.

166
00:11:36,745 --> 00:11:38,112
HOW MAY I HELP YOU?

167
00:11:38,113 --> 00:11:40,648
YEAH, I'D LIKE TO STAY IN
ROOM 1408 PLEASE.

168
00:11:40,649 --> 00:11:44,151
THAT ROOM IS UNAVAILABLE, SIR.

169
00:11:44,152 --> 00:11:46,784
I DIDN'T TELL YOU WHICH DATE.

170
00:11:48,357 --> 00:11:49,790
HOW ABOUT SATURDAY?

171
00:11:49,791 --> 00:11:51,854
IT'S UNAVAILABLE.

172
00:11:53,695 --> 00:11:56,564
THE FOLLOWING TUESDAY?

173
00:11:56,565 --> 00:11:58,332

174
00:11:58,333 --> 00:12:00,134
NEXT MONTH?

175
00:12:00,135 --> 00:12:01,636
UNAVAILABLE.

176
00:12:01,637 --> 00:12:04,132
NEXT SUMMER?

177
00:12:29,798 --> 00:12:32,733
SOMEBODY, ANYBODY,
WHERE'S GOOD CHINESE NEAR 48TH?

178
00:12:32,734 --> 00:12:35,069
I GOT TO HAVE LUNCH WITH
THAT IDIOT FROM RANDOM HOUSE. ANYBODY?

179
00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:37,104
SAM, MIKE ENSLIN CALLING
FROM LOS ANGELES AGAIN.

180
00:12:37,105 --> 00:12:39,540
I'LL TAKE IT IN THERE.

181
00:12:39,541 --> 00:12:41,008
CLAY, YOU GOT A SEC FOR
MIKE ENSLIN?

182
00:12:41,009 --> 00:12:42,510
SAY YES.
YES.

183
00:12:42,511 --> 00:12:45,079
GREAT. NOW LOOK, THIS GUY
TENDS TO GET A LITTLE MOROSE,

184
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:47,381
SO TRY TO KEEP THE ENERGY UP.
OTHERWISE HE STEWS IN HIS OWN FUNK.

185
00:12:47,382 --> 00:12:48,716
MIKE!
HEY, SAM.

186
00:12:48,717 --> 00:12:50,885
HEY HEY, READ THE FIRST
FIVE CHAPTERS LAST NIGHT.

187
00:12:50,886 --> 00:12:52,553
SPOOKY SHIT,
COULDN'T SLEEP A WINK.

188
00:12:52,554 --> 00:12:54,522
GREAT. HEY, DID YOU TAKE CARE
OF THAT THING?

189
00:12:54,523 --> 00:12:57,525
YOU'D BETTER BELIEVE I DID.
AND I GOT OUR TOP LAWYER HERE RIGHT NOW.

190
00:12:57,526 --> 00:12:58,693
MIKE, CLAY, CLAY, MIKE.

191
00:12:58,694 --> 00:12:59,960
HI, CLAY.
MIKE.

192
00:12:59,961 --> 00:13:01,862
TALK FAST, ALL RIGHT?
THIS GUY'S $400 AN HOUR.

193
00:13:01,863 --> 00:13:03,397
ALL RIGHT, CLAY,
WHAT'S UP WITH THE DOLPHIN?

194
00:13:03,398 --> 00:13:04,832
YEAH, THE DOLPHIN.

195
00:13:04,833 --> 00:13:07,435
THAT STICK-UP-ITS-ASS
RELIC ON LEXINGTON.

196
00:13:07,436 --> 00:13:09,503
TOO POSH FOR A FREE PLUG, RIGHT?

197
00:13:09,504 --> 00:13:11,806
WELL, YOU ARE GONNA LOVE
WHAT CLAY'S COOKED UP.

198
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:14,375
HE DUG AROUND AND FOUND YOU...
ARE YOU SITTING DOWN?

199
00:13:14,376 --> 00:13:16,844
A FEDERAL CIVIL RIGHTS LAW.

200
00:13:16,845 --> 00:13:18,913
LIKE SOMEBODY WOULD
DISCRIMINATE AGAINST YOU,

201
00:13:18,914 --> 00:13:22,049
A WELL-TO-DO WHITE GUY.
BUT THE LAW'S THE LAW, RIGHT, CLAY?

202
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:23,751
ERGO, IF THE ROOM'S NOT OCCUPIED

203
00:13:23,752 --> 00:13:25,753
THEY HAVE TO GIVE IT TO YOU.
REALLY?

204
00:13:25,754 --> 00:13:28,055
YEAH. NOW LOOK, THE MANAGER THERE'S
GONNA PUT UP A STINK

205
00:13:28,056 --> 00:13:29,323
BUT HE KNOWS THE DRILL.

206
00:13:29,324 --> 00:13:30,758
NOTHING YOU CAN'T HANDLE.
SO, MIKE...

207
00:13:30,759 --> 00:13:32,326
WE'LL BOOK THE ROOM
AND IF THEY REFUSE

208
00:13:32,327 --> 00:13:34,228
WE'LL RATTLE OUR SABERS
AND FILE SUIT.

209
00:13:34,229 --> 00:13:36,731
SO IT'S ALL DONE?
THANKS, CLAY. GET LOST, ALL RIGHT?

210
00:13:36,732 --> 00:13:38,833
BYE, CLAY.

211
00:13:38,834 --> 00:13:41,202
YEAH, MIKE, ARE YOU THERE?

212
00:13:41,203 --> 00:13:44,605
YEAH, UH, ON A MORE
PERSONAL NOTE,

213
00:13:44,606 --> 00:13:46,173
ARE YOU SURE
YOU WANT TO COME HERE?

214
00:13:46,174 --> 00:13:49,076
YEAH, OF COURSE. IT'LL MAKE A SOLID
CLOSING CHAPTER OF THE BOOK.

215
00:13:49,077 --> 00:13:51,812
YEAH YEAH, I KNOW THE ROUTINE.

216
00:13:51,813 --> 00:13:54,849
BUT, I MEAN, IT'S NEW YORK.

217
00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:57,785
ALL THAT HAPPENED... YOU REALLY WANT
TO PUT YOURSELF THROUGH THAT?

218
00:13:57,786 --> 00:14:00,121
I'LL BE QUICK.
ARE YOU GONNA CALL LILY?

219
00:14:00,122 --> 00:14:03,124
NO.
I DON'T WANT TO IMPOSE.

220
00:14:03,125 --> 00:14:06,519
IN AND OUT.
NOBODY GETS HURT.

221
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:11,294
IT'S JUST A JOB.

222
00:14:21,743 --> 00:14:23,738
HERE YOU ARE, DOLPHIN.

223
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:27,407
HEY! TAXI!

224
00:14:46,101 --> 00:14:48,702
IT'S A BEAUTIFUL ROOM,
WITH FABULOUS VIEWS OF THE CITY.

225
00:14:48,703 --> 00:14:50,595
PARDON ME, LADIES.

226
00:15:03,752 --> 00:15:05,252
THANKS VERY MUCH.

227
00:15:05,253 --> 00:15:06,787
WELCOME TO THE DOLPHIN, SIR.

228
00:15:06,788 --> 00:15:08,789
ARE YOU CHECKING IN?
MIKE ENSLIN.

229
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:10,057
ONE NIGHT.

230
00:15:10,058 --> 00:15:12,593
AND HOW ARE WE
SPELLING THAT TODAY?

231
00:15:12,594 --> 00:15:14,895
N-S-L-I-N?
N-S-L-I-N.

232
00:15:14,896 --> 00:15:16,390
YEAH.

233
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:23,938
UH, WOULD YOU EXCUSE ME
FOR A MOMENT, SIR?

234
00:15:23,939 --> 00:15:25,968
SURE.

235
00:15:28,777 --> 00:15:31,846
MR. DEMPSEY, MIKE ENSLIN'S
JUST CHECKED IN.

236
00:15:31,847 --> 00:15:34,348
WHERE IS HE?
HE'S OVER AT MY DESK.

237
00:15:34,349 --> 00:15:36,784
THAT'S FINE, MARIE.
I'LL TAKE CARE OF IT.

238
00:15:36,785 --> 00:15:38,450
OKAY.

239
00:15:43,558 --> 00:15:45,849
IT'LL JUST BE A MINUTE,
MR. ENSLIN.

240
00:15:50,632 --> 00:15:53,000
GOOD EVENING, SIR.
CAN I HELP YOU WITH YOUR BAG?

241
00:15:53,001 --> 00:15:55,769
NO.
VERY WELL.

242
00:15:57,372 --> 00:16:00,074
MR. ENSLIN,
I'M GERALD OLIN,

243
00:16:00,075 --> 00:16:01,876
MANAGER OF THE DOLPHIN.

244
00:16:01,877 --> 00:16:04,845
IF THERE'S ANYTHING THAT I CAN DO
FOR YOU WHILE YOU'RE HERE...

245
00:16:04,846 --> 00:16:07,147
DINNER RESERVATIONS,
THEATER TICKETS,

246
00:16:07,148 --> 00:16:08,916
MAYBE A KNICKS GAME?
ANYTHING...

247
00:16:08,917 --> 00:16:10,951
JUST TELL ME.
I AM AT YOUR SERVICE.

248
00:16:10,952 --> 00:16:14,121
WELL, IF I CAN JUST GET THE KEY TO 1408,
I CAN GET OUT OF YOUR HAIR.

249
00:16:14,122 --> 00:16:17,892
OH, WE WERE THINKING
OF UPGRADING YOU TO A PENTHOUSE SUITE.

250
00:16:17,893 --> 00:16:20,461
1408, PLEASE.

251
00:16:20,462 --> 00:16:22,630
INSISTENT, AREN'T WE?

252
00:16:22,631 --> 00:16:24,532
COULD YOU PLEASE HUMOR ME

253
00:16:24,533 --> 00:16:28,569
BY COMING TO MY OFFICE FOR A MORE
PRIVATE CONVERSATION?

254
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:31,270
SURE.
EXCELLENT.

255
00:16:35,076 --> 00:16:37,810
COME IN.
MAKE YOURSELF COMFORTABLE.

256
00:16:39,247 --> 00:16:41,115
1408 A SMOKING ROOM?

257
00:16:41,116 --> 00:16:43,450
AS A MATTER OF FACT,
IT IS. YES.

258
00:16:43,451 --> 00:16:46,887
GOOD, ONE LESS WORRY IN
THE WATCHES OF THE NIGHT.

259
00:16:46,888 --> 00:16:48,856
CARE FOR A CIGAR?

260
00:16:48,857 --> 00:16:51,025
NO THANK YOU, I DON'T SMOKE.

261
00:16:51,026 --> 00:16:52,826
OH THIS, YEAH.
THAT'S...

262
00:16:52,827 --> 00:16:55,296
IN CASE NUCLEAR WAR BREAKS OUT.

263
00:16:55,297 --> 00:16:56,497
I GAVE IT UP A LONG TIME AGO.

264
00:16:56,498 --> 00:16:58,399
IT'S PART HABIT,
PART SUPERSTITION.

265
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,800
IT'S, YOU KNOW, A WRITER THING.

266
00:16:59,801 --> 00:17:01,602
YOU DO DRINK, DON'T YOU?

267
00:17:01,603 --> 00:17:03,404
OF COURSE, I JUST SAID
I WAS A WRITER.

268
00:17:03,405 --> 00:17:06,740
LE CINQUANTE SEPT DECES, 1939.

269
00:17:06,741 --> 00:17:08,576
EXQUISITE.

270
00:17:08,577 --> 00:17:10,811
ABOUT $800 A BOTTLE,
WHEN YOU CAN FIND IT.

271
00:17:10,812 --> 00:17:13,979
I APPRECIATE THE BRIBE,
BUT I INTEND ON STAYING IN THAT ROOM.

272
00:17:14,983 --> 00:17:17,342
HOW LONG?
HOW LONG?

273
00:17:18,053 --> 00:17:19,720
MY USUAL IS OVERNIGHT.

274
00:17:19,721 --> 00:17:21,722
I SEE.

275
00:17:21,723 --> 00:17:24,592
NO ONE'S EVER LASTED
MORE THAN AN HOUR.

276
00:17:24,593 --> 00:17:26,560
JESUS, MAN.

277
00:17:26,561 --> 00:17:28,662
YOU OUGHT TO SHAVE YOUR EYEBROWS
AND PAINT YOUR HAIR GOLD

278
00:17:28,663 --> 00:17:31,198
IF YOU'RE GONNA TRY
TO SELL THAT SPOOK-HOUSE BULLSHIT.

279
00:17:31,199 --> 00:17:32,666
OTHERWISE, YOU'LL
SCARE THE CHILDREN.

280
00:17:32,667 --> 00:17:34,768
WHY ARE YOU MOCKING ME
WHEN I AM GENUINELY,

281
00:17:34,769 --> 00:17:37,004
TO THE BEST OF MY ABILITY,
TRYING TO HELP YOU?

282
00:17:37,005 --> 00:17:38,772
NO, YOU'RE PLAYING
A LITTLE GAME.

283
00:17:38,773 --> 00:17:41,041
YOU'RE SELLING THE MYSTIQUE.

284
00:17:41,042 --> 00:17:43,477
BUT EVENTUALLY, WE BOTH KNOW

285
00:17:43,478 --> 00:17:46,046
YOU'RE GONNA GIVE ME THE KEY
AND I'M GONNA GO UP TO THE ROOM

286
00:17:46,047 --> 00:17:48,782
AND I'M GONNA WRITE MY STORY
AND YOUR BOOKINGS ARE GONNA GO UP 50%.

287
00:17:48,783 --> 00:17:52,416
DO YOU MIND IF MY LITTLE FRIEND RECORDS
OUR CONVERSATION?

288
00:17:54,923 --> 00:17:56,357
I'LL TAKE THAT AS A YES.

289
00:17:56,358 --> 00:17:59,793
SIR, YOU QUITE
MISUNDERSTAND THE SITUATION.

290
00:17:59,794 --> 00:18:03,130
NOW, I KNOW THE DOLPHIN
DOESN'T HAVE THE CACHET OF THE PLAZA

291
00:18:03,131 --> 00:18:04,865
OR THE CARLYLE,

292
00:18:04,866 --> 00:18:08,035
BUT WE OPERATE AT 90% CAPACITY.

293
00:18:08,036 --> 00:18:09,236
ALWAYS.

294
00:18:09,237 --> 00:18:11,939
AND MY CONCERN HERE
IS NOT FOR THE HOTEL.

295
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:14,508
MY CONCERN HERE IS NOT FOR YOU.

296
00:18:14,509 --> 00:18:16,810
FRANKLY, SELFISHLY,

297
00:18:16,811 --> 00:18:19,813
I DON'T WANT YOU
TO CHECK INTO 1408

298
00:18:19,814 --> 00:18:22,182
BECAUSE I DON'T WANT
TO CLEAN UP THE MESS.

299
00:18:22,183 --> 00:18:25,619
NOW HOTELS ARE ALL
ABOUT PRESENTATION

300
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:28,222
AND FERTILE CREATURE COMFORTS.

301
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:31,225
MY TRAINING IS AS A MANAGER,

302
00:18:31,226 --> 00:18:33,227
NOT A CORONER.

303
00:18:33,228 --> 00:18:36,563
UNDER MY WATCH THERE HAVE
BEEN FOUR DEATHS... FOUR.

304
00:18:36,564 --> 00:18:39,166
AFTER THE LAST ONE,
I FORBADE ANY GUEST

305
00:18:39,167 --> 00:18:41,468
FROM CHECKING
INTO 1408 EVER AGAIN.

306
00:18:41,469 --> 00:18:44,838
THE LAST ONE WAS DAVID HIDE,
ORTHODONTIST, MANIC-DEPRESSIVE.

307
00:18:44,839 --> 00:18:47,007
SLIT HIS WRIST,
DID A LITTLE SELF-SURGERY,

308
00:18:47,008 --> 00:18:48,509
TURNED HIMSELF INTO
A EUNUCH, RIGHT?

309
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:51,045
YES. SO YOU'VE
DONE YOUR HOMEWORK.

310
00:18:51,046 --> 00:18:52,212
I'M A PROFESSIONAL TOO.

311
00:18:52,213 --> 00:18:55,149
WELL, GRIEVOUSLY, IN ITS
95-YEAR EXISTENCE,

312
00:18:55,150 --> 00:18:57,584
THE HOTEL HAS SEEN
SEVEN JUMPERS,

313
00:18:57,585 --> 00:18:59,653
FOUR OVERDOSES, FIVE HANGINGS,

314
00:18:59,654 --> 00:19:00,921
THREE MUTILATIONS...
THREE MUTILATIONS...

315
00:19:00,922 --> 00:19:02,656
TWO STRANGLINGS.
GENERAL MANAGER GERALD OLIN

316
00:19:02,657 --> 00:19:04,825
IS WELL-VERSED IN
THE HOTEL'S TRAGIC HISTORY,

317
00:19:04,826 --> 00:19:07,661
DRYLY RECITING THE DOCKET
OF CARNAGE LIKE A BOOKKEEPER

318
00:19:07,662 --> 00:19:09,430
DISCUSSING HIS LEDGER.

319
00:19:09,431 --> 00:19:11,532
WELL, YOU THINK
YOU'RE CLEVER, DON'T YOU?

320
00:19:11,533 --> 00:19:12,900
I KNOW THE GAME.

321
00:19:12,901 --> 00:19:14,334
WELL, DURING YOUR INVESTIGATION,

322
00:19:14,335 --> 00:19:16,870
DID YOU DISCOVER
THE 22 NATURAL DEATHS

323
00:19:16,871 --> 00:19:19,162
THAT HAVE OCCURRED IN 1408?

324
00:19:20,642 --> 00:19:22,009
NATURAL DEATHS?

325
00:19:22,010 --> 00:19:24,378
AH, DIDN'T FIND OUT ABOUT THEM

326
00:19:24,379 --> 00:19:27,948
BECAUSE THE NEWSPAPERS DON'T
PRINT ANYTHING ABOUT THEM.

327
00:19:27,949 --> 00:19:31,318
HMM. ALL TOLD,
THERE HAVE BEEN 56 DEATHS

328
00:19:31,319 --> 00:19:32,786
IN 1408.

329
00:19:32,787 --> 00:19:36,056
56?
YOU'RE SHITTING ME.

330
00:19:36,057 --> 00:19:37,891
YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING.

331
00:19:37,892 --> 00:19:40,961
THE CAUSES OF DEATH
IN 1408 RANGE

332
00:19:40,962 --> 00:19:43,430
FROM HEART ATTACK,
STROKE, DROWNING...

333
00:19:43,431 --> 00:19:46,166
DROWNING?
YES, ONE MR. GRADY MILLER

334
00:19:46,167 --> 00:19:48,335
DROWNED IN HIS CHICKEN SOUP.

335
00:19:48,336 --> 00:19:50,738
THAT'S HARD TO DO.
HOW... HOW DID HE DO THAT?

336
00:19:50,739 --> 00:19:52,372
HOW INDEED?

337
00:19:52,373 --> 00:19:55,409
INTERESTING.
IT'S ALL IN HERE.

338
00:19:55,410 --> 00:19:58,812
I WILL LET YOU HAVE THIS
AND GIVE YOU ACCESS TO MY OFFICE.

339
00:19:58,813 --> 00:20:01,181
YOU CAN TAKE NOTES,
PUT IT ALL IN YOUR BOOK.

340
00:20:01,182 --> 00:20:03,417
MY ONLY CONDITION

341
00:20:03,418 --> 00:20:07,154
IS THAT YOU DO NOT
STAY IN THAT ROOM.

342
00:20:07,155 --> 00:20:09,890
YOU'LL LET ME LOOK
AT ALL THAT STUFF?

343
00:20:09,891 --> 00:20:12,182
HMM.

344
00:20:19,601 --> 00:20:22,870
I NEVER DID GET THAT DRINK.

345
00:20:41,189 --> 00:20:44,558
OH, THAT IS GOOD.
HERE, KEEP IT.

346
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:46,884
COMPLIMENTS OF THE HOUSE.

347
00:20:58,206 --> 00:20:59,940
I'M STILL STAYING.
DAMN IT TO HELL!

348
00:20:59,941 --> 00:21:01,875
I'M SORRY.

349
00:21:01,876 --> 00:21:04,978
ALL RIGHT HERE.
HERE, READ THE GODFORSAKEN THING.

350
00:21:04,979 --> 00:21:07,114
I GUARANTEE YOU,
ONCE YOU'VE READ IT

351
00:21:07,115 --> 00:21:09,781
YOU WON'T WANT TO STAY IN 1408.

352
00:21:11,452 --> 00:21:13,754
MR. KEVIN O'MALLEY,

353
00:21:13,755 --> 00:21:15,589
SEWING MACHINE SALESMAN.

354
00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:17,491
CHECKED INTO THE HOTEL
THE FIRST WEEK IT OPENED...

355
00:21:17,492 --> 00:21:20,460
OCTOBER, 1912.
CUT HIS OWN THROAT, RIGHT?

356
00:21:20,461 --> 00:21:22,062
OH, THAT'S NOT
THE HORRIFIC PART.

357
00:21:22,063 --> 00:21:24,131
AFTERWARDS, IN A FIT
OF INSANITY,

358
00:21:24,132 --> 00:21:26,600
HE TRIED TO STITCH
HIMSELF BACK TOGETHER

359
00:21:26,601 --> 00:21:29,069
USING AN OLD SEWING NEEDLE
BEFORE HE BLED TO DEATH.

360
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:30,804
EASY, MAN.

361
00:21:30,805 --> 00:21:33,841
LOOK, MR. ENSLIN,
YOU DON'T HAVE TO STAY IN 1408.

362
00:21:33,842 --> 00:21:35,909
YOU CAN TAKE
PHOTOGRAPHS OF 1404.

363
00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:39,479
IT HAS THE EXACT SAME LAYOUT AND NO ONE
WILL EVER KNOW THE DIFFERENCE.

364
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:42,182
MY READERS EXPECT THE TRUTH.
YOUR READERS?

365
00:21:42,183 --> 00:21:45,018
YOUR READERS EXPECT
GROTESQUERIES

366
00:21:45,019 --> 00:21:47,221
AND CHEAP THRILLS.

367
00:21:47,222 --> 00:21:49,990
"THE HEADLESS GHOST
OF MR. EUGENE RILSBY

368
00:21:49,991 --> 00:21:51,792
STILL WALKS
HIS ABANDONED FARMHOUSE."

369
00:21:51,793 --> 00:21:55,262
"THE BARKING PHANTOM
OF MOUNT HOPE CEMETERY."

370
00:21:55,263 --> 00:21:57,030
A DIRECT QUOTE...
HOW'D YOU KNOW THAT?

371
00:21:57,031 --> 00:21:58,832
YOUR BOOKS AREN'T HARD TO FIND.

372
00:21:58,833 --> 00:22:00,734
THEY'RE ON THE BARGAIN SHELVES

373
00:22:00,735 --> 00:22:03,503
OF ANY PAPERBACK NOVEL STORE;

374
00:22:03,504 --> 00:22:07,074
FULL OF CYNICISM,
WRITTEN BY A TALENTED, INTELLIGENT MAN

375
00:22:07,075 --> 00:22:09,776
WHO DOESN'T BELIEVE
IN ANYTHING OR ANYONE BUT HIMSELF.

376
00:22:09,777 --> 00:22:12,713
GUILTY AS CHARGED.

377
00:22:12,714 --> 00:22:15,549
HEY LISTEN, THIS MEETING'S OVER.
WHY DON'T YOU GIVE ME THE ROOM?

378
00:22:15,550 --> 00:22:18,085
OH PLEASE, DON'T ACT
LIKE A HURT SCHOOLGIRL.

379
00:22:18,086 --> 00:22:21,188
IN FACT, YOU SURPRISED ME.
OH.

380
00:22:21,189 --> 00:22:24,057
YOU ARE NOT
THE HACK-N-SLASH I EXPECTED.

381
00:22:24,058 --> 00:22:26,693
I RATHER LIKED THE FIRST ONE,
THE HARDCOVER.

382
00:22:26,694 --> 00:22:30,430
WHAT WAS IT CALLED?
"THE LAST WALK..."

383
00:22:30,431 --> 00:22:31,765
"LONG ROAD HOME."

384
00:22:31,766 --> 00:22:34,768
"THE LONG ROAD HOME," YES.

385
00:22:34,769 --> 00:22:37,271
I RATHER THOUGHT
THE FATHER WAS A BASTARD.

386
00:22:37,272 --> 00:22:39,206
YEAH, HE WAS.

387
00:22:39,207 --> 00:22:41,275
UM...

388
00:22:41,276 --> 00:22:42,776
LOOK MAN, JUST GIVE ME THE KEY.

389
00:22:42,777 --> 00:22:45,913
MR. ENSLIN...
JUST GIVE ME THE KEY!

390
00:22:45,914 --> 00:22:48,982
LISTEN, I STAYED
AT THE BIGSBY HOUSE.

391
00:22:48,983 --> 00:22:51,952
I BRUSHED MY GODDAMN TEETH
RIGHT NEXT TO THE TUB

392
00:22:51,953 --> 00:22:54,288
WHERE SIR DAVID SMITH
DROWNED HIS WHOLE FAMILY.

393
00:22:54,289 --> 00:22:57,291
AND I STOPPED BEING AFRAID
OF VAMPIRES WHEN I WAS 12.

394
00:22:57,292 --> 00:23:00,894
DO YOU KNOW WHY I CAN STAY
IN YOUR SPOOKY OLD ROOM, MR. OLIN?

395
00:23:00,895 --> 00:23:03,730
BECAUSE I KNOW THAT
GHOULIES AND GHOSTIES

396
00:23:03,731 --> 00:23:06,329
AND LONG-LEGGED BEASTIES
DON'T EXIST.

397
00:23:07,168 --> 00:23:08,702
EVEN IF THEY DID,

398
00:23:08,703 --> 00:23:11,597
THERE'S NO GOD TO PROTECT
US FROM THEM, IS THERE?

399
00:23:13,041 --> 00:23:15,075
SO I CAN'T TALK YOU OUT OF THIS?

400
00:23:15,076 --> 00:23:17,678
I THINK WE'VE REACHED
AN UNDERSTANDING.

401
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:20,147
VERY WELL.

402
00:23:20,148 --> 00:23:23,008
COME WITH ME.

403
00:23:34,562 --> 00:23:37,030
MOST HOTELS HAVE
SWITCHED TO MAGNETICS.

404
00:23:37,031 --> 00:23:40,500
AN ACTUAL KEY.
THAT'S A NICE TOUCH... IT'S ANTIQUEY.

405
00:23:40,501 --> 00:23:44,104
WE HAVE MAGNETIC CARDS ALSO, BUT
ELECTRONICS DON'T SEEM TO WORK IN 1408.

406
00:23:44,105 --> 00:23:46,006
HOPE YOU DON'T HAVE A PACEMAKER.

407
00:23:46,007 --> 00:23:49,009
GENERAL MANAGER CLAIMS THAT THE PHANTOM
IN ROOM INTERFERES...

408
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:51,144
I HAVE NEVER USED
THE WORD "PHANTOM."

409
00:23:51,145 --> 00:23:53,647
OH, I'M SORRY.
SPIRIT? SPECTER?

410
00:23:53,648 --> 00:23:55,215
NO, YOU MISUNDERSTAND.

411
00:23:55,216 --> 00:23:57,517
WHATEVER'S IN 1408
IS NOTHING LIKE THAT.

412
00:23:57,518 --> 00:24:00,354
THEN WHAT IS IT?

413
00:24:00,355 --> 00:24:03,089
IT'S AN EVIL FUCKING ROOM.

414
00:24:04,726 --> 00:24:07,153
PLEASE.

415
00:24:10,598 --> 00:24:14,234
MR. ODIN.

416
00:24:14,235 --> 00:24:17,333
OH, OUI.
TRES BIEN.

417
00:24:22,510 --> 00:24:25,335
WHY DON'T THE OWNERS
JUST CLOSE THE ROOM?

418
00:24:26,714 --> 00:24:29,216
THE YASUKO CORPORATION
PREFERS TO PRETEND THERE'S NO PROBLEM.

419
00:24:29,217 --> 00:24:32,509
JUST AS THEY PRETEND
THERE'S NO 13TH FLOOR.

420
00:24:33,855 --> 00:24:35,856
THE ROOM, IT'S GOT TO BE FILTHY.

421
00:24:35,857 --> 00:24:38,091
I MEAN, THE SHEETS HAVEN'T BEEN CHANGED
IN WHAT? 11 YEARS?

422
00:24:38,092 --> 00:24:41,061
NO NO NO,
WE'RE VERY PROFESSIONAL.

423
00:24:41,062 --> 00:24:44,531
1408 GETS A LIGHT
TURN ONCE A MONTH.

424
00:24:44,532 --> 00:24:46,800
I SUPERVISE, THE MAIDS
WORK IN PAIRS.

425
00:24:46,801 --> 00:24:49,603
WE TREAT THE ROOM
AS IF IT'S A CHAMBER

426
00:24:49,604 --> 00:24:51,171
FILLED WITH POISON GAS.

427
00:24:51,172 --> 00:24:54,908
WE ONLY STAY 10 MINUTES
AND I INSIST THE DOOR REMAIN OPEN.

428
00:24:54,909 --> 00:24:57,575
BUT STILL...

429
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:02,249
A FEW YEARS AGO, A YOUNG
MAID FROM EL SALVADOR

430
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:03,850
FOUND HERSELF LOCKED
IN THE BATHROOM.

431
00:25:03,851 --> 00:25:05,118
SHE WAS ONLY THERE
FOR A FEW MOMENTS,

432
00:25:05,119 --> 00:25:07,154
BUT WHEN WE PULLED
HER OUT, SHE WAS...

433
00:25:07,155 --> 00:25:09,923
SHE WAS DEAD.
NO, BLIND.

434
00:25:09,924 --> 00:25:12,159
SHE HAD TAKEN A PAIR OF SCISSORS

435
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:14,161
AND GOUGED HER EYES OUT.

436
00:25:14,162 --> 00:25:16,563
SHE WAS LAUGHING HYSTERICALLY.

437
00:25:16,564 --> 00:25:19,162
OUCH.
YOUR FLOOR.

438
00:25:20,034 --> 00:25:21,701
WELL, THIS IS WHERE
WE PART COMPANY.

439
00:25:21,702 --> 00:25:24,971
THIS IS AS CLOSE
AS I GET TO 1408

440
00:25:24,972 --> 00:25:27,331
UNLESS IT'S THAT TIME
OF THE MONTH.

441
00:25:28,943 --> 00:25:31,711
SEE YOU TOMORROW.
MR. ENSLIN?

442
00:25:31,712 --> 00:25:33,713
PLEASE...

443
00:25:33,714 --> 00:25:35,982
DON'T DO THIS.

444
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:41,188
I'LL CALL YOU ABOUT
THOSE KNICKS TICKETS.

445
00:26:30,138 --> 00:26:32,531
STOP IT!

446
00:27:11,212 --> 00:27:14,080
OKAY. IT'S OKAY, SWEETIE.
WE'RE HOME NOW.

447
00:27:14,081 --> 00:27:15,473
HERE WE GO.

448
00:28:19,981 --> 00:28:22,408
THIS IS IT?

449
00:28:23,117 --> 00:28:26,079
YOU GOT TO BE KIDDING ME.

450
00:28:41,769 --> 00:28:45,105
ROUND ONE GOES TO THE HIDEOUS MR. OLIN
FOR EFFECTIVE AGGRESSIVENESS.

451
00:28:45,106 --> 00:28:48,739
I HAVE TO ADMIT,
HE HAD ME GOING FOR A MOMENT.

452
00:28:49,710 --> 00:28:52,579
BUT WHERE IS
THE BONE-CHILLING TERROR?

453
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:55,644
SHOW ME THE RIVERS OF BLOOD.

454
00:29:01,322 --> 00:29:04,090
IT'S JUST A ROOM.

455
00:29:48,703 --> 00:29:52,005
$8 FOR BEER NUTS.

456
00:29:52,006 --> 00:29:54,574
THIS ROOM IS EVIL.

457
00:29:54,575 --> 00:29:57,677
OLIN SAID HOTELS ARE ABOUT
FERTILE CREATURE COMFORTS.

458
00:29:57,678 --> 00:30:00,013
IT'S A GOOD LINE, BUT I WONDER

459
00:30:00,014 --> 00:30:02,849
WHETHER THEY'RE REALLY
ABOUT REASSURING PLATITUDES,

460
00:30:02,850 --> 00:30:05,385
A PROSAIC SENSE OF THE FAMILIAR.

461
00:30:05,386 --> 00:30:08,788
"YES, I'VE BEEN HERE BEFORE.

462
00:30:08,789 --> 00:30:11,958
IT'S SAFE."

463
00:30:11,959 --> 00:30:14,494
THERE'S A SOFA,

464
00:30:14,495 --> 00:30:18,031
A WRITING DESK,
A FAUX ANTIQUE ARMOIRE,

465
00:30:18,032 --> 00:30:20,200
FLORAL WALLPAPER.

466
00:30:20,201 --> 00:30:22,602
CARPET'S UNREMARKABLE,
EXCEPT FOR A STAIN

467
00:30:22,603 --> 00:30:25,839
BENEATH A THRIFT-STORE PAINTING
OF A SCHOONER LOST AT SEA.

468
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:29,175
THE WORK IS DONE IN THE
PREDICTABLY DULL FASHION

469
00:30:29,176 --> 00:30:31,077
OF CURRIER & IVES.

470
00:30:31,078 --> 00:30:33,613
THE SECOND PAINTING
IS OF AN OLD WOMAN

471
00:30:33,614 --> 00:30:35,882
READING BEDTIME STORIES...
A WHISTLER KNOCKOFF...

472
00:30:35,883 --> 00:30:37,684
TO A GROUP OF DERANGED CHILDREN

473
00:30:37,685 --> 00:30:41,421
AS ANOTHER MADONNA AND CHILD
WATCH FROM THE BACKGROUND.

474
00:30:41,422 --> 00:30:45,125
IT DOES HAVE
THE VAGUE AIR OF MENACE.

475
00:30:45,126 --> 00:30:49,229
THE THIRD AND FINAL
PAINFULLY DULL PAINTING

476
00:30:49,230 --> 00:30:51,264
IS THE EVER-POPULAR
"THE HUNT."

477
00:30:51,265 --> 00:30:53,933
HORSES, HOUNDS
AND CONSTIPATED BRITISH LORDS.

478
00:30:53,934 --> 00:30:57,036
SOME SMARTASS SPOKE ABOUT
THE BANALITY OF EVIL.

479
00:30:57,037 --> 00:30:59,139
IF THAT'S TRUE,

480
00:30:59,140 --> 00:31:02,204
THEN WE'RE IN
THE SEVENTH CIRCLE OF HELL.

481
00:31:04,912 --> 00:31:07,646
IT DOES HAVE ITS CHARMS.

482
00:31:14,722 --> 00:31:17,924
THE PANORAMA IS TYPICALLY CRAMPED
NEW YORK CITY VIEW OF NOTHING:

483
00:31:17,925 --> 00:31:20,660
DULL, GRAY BUILDINGS ALL AROUND;

484
00:31:20,661 --> 00:31:23,963
HONKING TRAFFIC BELOW.
THE VIEW OF A...

485
00:31:23,964 --> 00:31:27,367
WE'VE ONLY JUST BEGUN...
OW!

486
00:31:27,368 --> 00:31:31,538
TO LIVE...
HOLY SHIT.

487
00:31:31,539 --> 00:31:36,139
WHITE LACE AND PROMISES

488
00:31:37,311 --> 00:31:42,248
A KISS FOR LUCK
AND WE'RE ON OUR WAY

489
00:31:42,249 --> 00:31:45,785
WE'VE ONLY BEGUN

490
00:31:45,786 --> 00:31:49,122
BEFORE THE RISING SUN...

491
00:31:49,123 --> 00:31:52,392
BRAVO, OLIN.
THAT IS VERY UNSETTLING.

492
00:31:53,694 --> 00:31:59,032
SO MANY ROADS TO CHOOSE

493
00:31:59,033 --> 00:32:04,704
WE START OFF WALKING
AND LEARN TO RUN

494
00:32:04,705 --> 00:32:06,673
AND YET WE'VE JUST BEGUN...

495
00:32:06,674 --> 00:32:09,238
THAT MEANS
SOMEONE'S IN THE ROOM.

496
00:32:12,179 --> 00:32:15,482
HELLO?

497
00:32:15,483 --> 00:32:16,943
HELLO!

498
00:32:20,221 --> 00:32:21,647
WHOA.

499
00:32:25,993 --> 00:32:27,726
THAT IS BIZARRE.

500
00:32:31,432 --> 00:32:33,900
FINALLY I GOT
SOMETHING TO WRITE ABOUT.

501
00:32:33,901 --> 00:32:36,669
A GHOST THAT OFFERS
TURN-DOWN SERVICE.

502
00:32:39,807 --> 00:32:41,608
ALL RIGHT.

503
00:32:41,609 --> 00:32:44,477
ALL RIGHT, LET'S ENCYCLOPEDIA
BROWN THIS BITCH.

504
00:32:44,478 --> 00:32:46,479
STARTED OFF THE WINDOW,

505
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:48,548
HEAR THE MUSIC, NAB MY HEAD.

506
00:32:48,549 --> 00:32:51,050
I TURN AROUND, GO TO
THE BED FOR THE CHOCOLATE.

507
00:32:51,051 --> 00:32:53,052
THEN I GO INTO THE CLOSET
WHICH WOULD HAVE...

508
00:32:53,053 --> 00:32:55,088
MY BACK WAS TURNED.
IT WOULD HAVE LET

509
00:32:55,089 --> 00:32:58,491
HOUDINI HAVE TIME TO COME IN
HERE DO THE PAPER TRICK...

510
00:32:58,492 --> 00:33:01,420
AND HE'S IN THE LIVING ROOM.

511
00:33:16,010 --> 00:33:17,971
OUT!

512
00:33:23,584 --> 00:33:25,351
HUH.

513
00:33:31,692 --> 00:33:33,721
HELLO?

514
00:33:43,070 --> 00:33:45,838
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO
TRY HARDER, ASSHOLE!

515
00:33:45,839 --> 00:33:47,907
NICE AND WARM FOR YOU UP THERE?

516
00:33:47,908 --> 00:33:49,869
IT'S HOT DOWN HERE, BUBBA.

517
00:33:58,919 --> 00:34:00,880
COME ON.

518
00:34:15,636 --> 00:34:18,037
FRONT DESK.
HELLO, THIS IS MIKE ENSLIN.

519
00:34:18,038 --> 00:34:20,373
GUESS WHICH ROOM.
GOOD EVENING, SIR.

520
00:34:20,374 --> 00:34:22,408
GOOD EVENING.
ARE YOU READY TO CHECK OUT?

521
00:34:22,409 --> 00:34:24,310
CHECK OUT?
NO NO NO NO NO.

522
00:34:24,311 --> 00:34:26,145
CHECK OUT, CHECK OUT, NO.
WHY WOULD I CHECK OUT?

523
00:34:26,146 --> 00:34:29,616
ESPECIALLY WITH THIS WONDERFUL
MAID SERVICE. IT'S SO DISCREET.

524
00:34:29,617 --> 00:34:32,251
NO NO NO, I NEED YOU TO SEND SOMEBODY
TO FIX MY THERMOSTAT.

525
00:34:32,252 --> 00:34:34,554
ROOM'S ON FIRE.
OF COURSE, SIR.

526
00:34:34,555 --> 00:34:36,155
WE'LL SEND AN ENGINEER RIGHT UP.

527
00:34:36,156 --> 00:34:38,658
YOU WILL?
ABSOLUTELY.

528
00:34:38,659 --> 00:34:40,722
THANK YOU.
YOU'RE WELCOME.

529
00:35:22,536 --> 00:35:25,004
HOW MANY THIN WALLS

530
00:35:25,005 --> 00:35:27,240
HAVE WE PUT UP WITH TOGETHER,

531
00:35:27,241 --> 00:35:29,532
OLD BOY?

532
00:35:30,244 --> 00:35:33,377
HOW MANY SARCOPHAGAL CHAMBERS?

533
00:35:36,817 --> 00:35:39,347
HOTEL ROOMS ARE A NATURALLY
CREEPY PLACE...

534
00:35:40,054 --> 00:35:41,654
DON'T YOU THINK?

535
00:35:41,655 --> 00:35:44,023
I MEAN, HOW MANY PEOPLE
HAVE SLEPT IN THAT BED BEFORE YOU?

536
00:35:44,024 --> 00:35:45,658
HOW MANY OF THEM WERE SICK?

537
00:35:45,659 --> 00:35:48,189
HOW MANY OF THEM
LOST THEIR MINDS?

538
00:35:50,097 --> 00:35:53,594
HOW MANY OF THEM... DIED?

539
00:35:55,269 --> 00:35:57,570
WE CAME HERE TO GET THE STORY,

540
00:35:57,571 --> 00:36:00,738
AND WE DON'T RATTLE, DO WE?

541
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:29,095
IT'S NOT THAT WHAT
I'M SEEING IS NOT REAL.

542
00:37:29,096 --> 00:37:31,660
IT JUST AIN'T AS REAL
AS IT SEEMS.

543
00:37:35,769 --> 00:37:37,637
HELLO?

544
00:37:37,638 --> 00:37:40,498
YOU GOT A PROBLEM
WITH THE TEMPERATURE?

545
00:37:46,146 --> 00:37:47,743
YEAH.

546
00:37:52,486 --> 00:37:54,310
COME ON.

547
00:37:57,658 --> 00:37:59,425
IS IT TOO HOT OR TOO COLD?

548
00:37:59,426 --> 00:38:01,360
WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE?

549
00:38:01,361 --> 00:38:03,496
COME ON IN.

550
00:38:03,497 --> 00:38:05,398
THE BOX IS RIGHT OVER HERE.

551
00:38:05,399 --> 00:38:07,223
IT'S STUCK AROUND 80.

552
00:38:10,070 --> 00:38:12,171
I SAID THE BOX IS RIGHT HERE.

553
00:38:12,172 --> 00:38:15,066
I KNOW WHERE THE HELL IT IS,
BUT I AIN'T GOING IN THIS ROOM.

554
00:38:16,143 --> 00:38:18,678
YOU JUST HAVE TO WALK
SIX OR SEVEN FEET.

555
00:38:18,679 --> 00:38:21,214
I SAID I AIN'T GOING IN.
YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED IN HERE?

556
00:38:21,215 --> 00:38:22,481
YES, I'M WELL AWARE OF THAT.

557
00:38:22,482 --> 00:38:24,383
LOOK, I'LL TALK YOU THROUGH IT.

558
00:38:24,384 --> 00:38:26,552
ANY JACKASS CAN FIX THAT THING.

559
00:38:26,553 --> 00:38:28,718
JUST REMOVE THE PANEL.

560
00:38:32,593 --> 00:38:35,261
OKAY, NOW ABOVE THAT COIL

561
00:38:35,262 --> 00:38:37,063
IS A LITTLE TUBE
FILLED WITH MERCURY.

562
00:38:37,064 --> 00:38:39,532
THAT'S SUPPOSED TO ACTIVATE
THE CONTACT SWITCH.

563
00:38:39,533 --> 00:38:42,702
BUT THIS HOTEL'S SO GODDAMN OLD,
HALF THE SHIT IN HERE DON'T WORK.

564
00:38:42,703 --> 00:38:44,403
JUST GIVE THE TUBE A LITTLE TAP.

565
00:38:44,404 --> 00:38:46,296
JUST TAP THE DAMN THING!

566
00:38:48,275 --> 00:38:50,076
YEAH, THERE IT IS.

567
00:38:50,077 --> 00:38:52,545
OH, SIR, YOU'RE A GENIUS.

568
00:38:52,546 --> 00:38:54,580
A GENTLEMAN AND A SCHOLAR.

569
00:38:54,581 --> 00:38:56,371
THANK YOU.
LET ME GIVE YOU...

570
00:38:57,150 --> 00:38:58,849
A TIP.

571
00:39:01,355 --> 00:39:03,213
SIR?

572
00:39:31,451 --> 00:39:35,585
AND YET WE'VE JUST BEGUN

573
00:39:39,059 --> 00:39:41,427
SHARING HORIZONS...

574
00:39:41,428 --> 00:39:43,662
SON OF A...

00:40:04,818 --> 00:40:07,313
NOBODY LASTS MORE THAN AN HOUR.

576
00:40:10,724 --> 00:40:12,992
VERY EFFECTIVE.

577
00:40:51,898 --> 00:40:54,098
OH FUCK!
JESUS!

578
00:40:55,135 --> 00:40:56,769
OH, GOD.

579
00:40:56,770 --> 00:40:59,664
OW!

582
00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:58,864
WE'VE ONLY JUST BEGUN

00:41:58,865 --> 00:42:00,962

584
00:42:10,410 --> 00:42:13,440

HELLO?
SIR, I'M AFRAID THERE WAS

586
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:21,020
A MISCOMMUNICATION
IN THE KITCHEN.

587
00:42:21,021 --> 00:42:23,222
THERE'S GOING TO BE A 10-MINUTE DELAY
WITH YOUR SANDWICH.

588
00:42:23,223 --> 00:42:24,390
SANDWICH?
WHAT SANDWICH?

589
00:42:24,391 --> 00:42:26,292
I DIDN'T ORDER ANY SANDWICH.
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

590
00:42:26,293 --> 00:42:27,827
I'M SORRY.
YOU'RE WELCOME TO SUBSTITUTE

595
00:42:35,836 --> 00:42:38,104
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?
MY GODDAMN HAND IS HURT.

596
00:42:38,105 --> 00:42:40,906
I UNDERSTAND. IF YOU LEAVE YOUR DRY

597
00:42:40,907 --> 00:42:43,075
WE'LL HAVE IT PRESSED

598
00:42:43,076 --> 00:42:45,411
SHIT, BITCH! CALL ME A CAB

599

I'M GONNA TAKE LEGAL ACTION!

I'M LOSING MY MIND.

636
00:46:33,373 --> 00:46:35,300
I CAN SEE YOU, DAD.

637
00:46:40,313 --> 00:46:43,480
DADDY?
DADDY, WHERE ARE YOU?

00:46:45,218 --> 00:46:48,146
I'M GONNA GET YOU.

00:46:48,888 --> 00:46:50,422
READY OR NOT,

00:46:50,423 --> 00:46:52,657
HERE I COME.

641
00:46:59,199 --> 00:47:01,433
HERE YOU ARE.

642
00:47:01,434 --> 00:47:04,567
I SEE YOU, DADDY.

643
00:47:06,473 --> 00:47:08,607
GET AHOLD OF YOURSELF.

644
00:47:08,608 --> 00:47:10,909
YOU'RE RUNNING TO PLACES
THAT AREN'T REAL.

645
00:47:10,910 --> 00:47:13,337
GET UP. GET UP.

646
00:47:15,715 --> 00:47:17,573
YOU'RE LOSING THE PLOT.

647
00:47:21,921 --> 00:47:24,790
YOU'RE LOSING
THE WHOLE GODDAMN STRUCTURE.

648
00:47:24,791 --> 00:47:28,193
DADDY! FIND ME.

649
00:47:28,194 --> 00:47:31,196
PSYCHOKINETIC FIBRILLATIONS.

650
00:47:31,197 --> 00:47:34,466
A TIRED MIND AMONG CLASSIC HAUNTED-HOUSE
POWERS OF SUGGESTION.

651
00:47:34,467 --> 00:47:36,402
GASLIT FEATURES, FADED RUGS,

652
00:47:36,403 --> 00:47:38,570
LIKE THAT MOTEL IN KANSAS.

653
00:47:38,571 --> 00:47:41,567
THERE'S A REASON FOR EVERYTHING.
JUST THINK.

654
00:47:44,043 --> 00:47:46,243
WHAT'S THAT?

655
00:47:46,980 --> 00:47:50,149
WHAT IS THAT?
IS THAT A SPYCAM?

656
00:47:50,150 --> 00:47:53,719
WHO IS THAT?
ARE YOU ENJOYING THIS?

657
00:47:53,720 --> 00:47:56,921
IS THAT THE SADISTIC OWNER
OF THE HOTEL OR IS THAT OLIN?

658
00:47:59,959 --> 00:48:02,159
WAIT A MINUTE.

659
00:48:03,329 --> 00:48:05,230
HE GAVE ME BOOZE.

660
00:48:05,231 --> 00:48:08,193
HE GAVE ME BOOZE.
DID HE TAKE A SIP?

661
00:48:09,202 --> 00:48:11,367
I CAN'T REMEMBER.

662
00:48:13,339 --> 00:48:15,040
HE DOSED ME!

663
00:48:15,041 --> 00:48:17,176
IT WAS THE BOOZE
OR THE CHOCOLATES.

664
00:48:17,177 --> 00:48:19,178
NEVER TAKE CANDY FROM STRANGERS.

665
00:48:19,179 --> 00:48:21,914
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.
I'M JUST HALLUCINATING.

666
00:48:21,915 --> 00:48:24,183
I'M JUST HALLUCINATING.

667
00:48:24,184 --> 00:48:25,651
I'VE JUST GOT TO RIDE THIS OUT.

668
00:48:25,652 --> 00:48:27,152
I'VE GOT TO RIDE THIS OUT

669
00:48:27,153 --> 00:48:29,944
FOR FOUR OR FIVE HOURS
AND I'M STRAIGHT. OKAY.

670
00:48:31,057 --> 00:48:32,722
YOU CAN DO THIS.

671
00:48:34,194 --> 00:48:35,961
OH, MAN. I'M GONNA GET YOU.

672
00:48:35,962 --> 00:48:38,564
YOU ARE FINISHED.
COME HERE. COME HERE!

673
00:48:38,565 --> 00:48:42,000
DAD! SIT DOWN!

674
00:48:42,001 --> 00:48:43,893
YOU WANT ME TO SIT DOWN?

675
00:48:45,171 --> 00:48:46,605
YOU WANT ME TO SIT DOWN?

676
00:48:46,606 --> 00:48:48,240
YES!
OKAY, HOLD ON, HOLD ON.

00:48:48,241 --> 00:48:49,808

680
00:48:55,248 --> 00:48:58,608
WELCOME TO THE MOST
UGLIEST PERSON COMPETITION.

681
00:48:59,486 --> 00:49:00,986

684
00:49:07,894 --> 00:49:09,795

685
00:49:09,796 --> 00:49:12,631
LOOK AT THAT.
THOSE ARE SOME UGLY FISH.

686
00:49:12,632 --> 00:49:15,033
THEY'RE SO UGLY
THEY'RE RUNNING FROM YOU.

687
00:49:15,034 --> 00:49:17,035
THIRD PLACE GOES TO MIKE ENSLIN.

688
00:49:17,036 --> 00:49:18,804
SURPRISE SURPRISE.

RIGHT, HOW'S THIS FOR UGLY?

690
00:49:26,145 --> 00:49:28,647
SECOND PLACE
GOES TO LILY ENSLIN.

691
00:49:28,648 --> 00:49:31,817
THAT WAS GOOD.

692
00:49:31,818 --> 00:49:35,420
THAT'S KIND OF LIKE BEOWULF
MEETS A REDNECK.

693
00:49:35,421 --> 00:49:39,919
I LIKE IT.
AND FIRST PLACE GOES TO KATIE ENSLIN.

694
00:49:41,895 --> 00:49:43,962
THAT IS A TERROR.
THAT IS...

695
00:49:43,963 --> 00:49:46,198
OH, GOD! DON'T SHOW
ME THAT FACE!

696
00:49:46,199 --> 00:49:48,160
OH, I CAN'T LOOK AT IT AGAIN.

697
00:49:49,402 --> 00:49:51,537
WHATEVER YOU DO, DON'T TURN AROUND.

698
00:49:51,538 --> 00:49:53,601
WHATEVER YOU DO,
DON'T SHOW US THAT FACE.

699
00:51:03,776 --> 00:51:06,510
MA'AM, CAN YOU HEAR ME?

700
00:51:09,415 --> 00:51:11,615
MA'AM, I NEED YOUR HELP.

701
00:51:12,485 --> 00:51:14,582
PLEASE, MA'AM, CAN YOU HEAR ME?

702
00:51:16,589 --> 00:51:19,424
KID, BE QUIET.

703
00:51:19,425 --> 00:51:21,625
PLEASE, MA'AM.

704
00:51:23,296 --> 00:51:26,292
QUIET!

705
00:52:19,118 --> 00:52:22,216
I... WISH...

706
00:52:22,922 --> 00:52:25,986
I WAS DEAD.

707
00:52:28,961 --> 00:52:31,354
WHERE'S MY GARDEN?

708
00:52:32,665 --> 00:52:35,434
I CAN'T SMELL ANYTHING.

709
00:52:35,435 --> 00:52:38,727
I HATE THIS PLACE.

710
00:52:43,576 --> 00:52:45,867
HOW DID I GET HERE?

711
00:52:49,649 --> 00:52:51,550
POP.

712
00:52:51,551 --> 00:52:53,512
DAD.

713
00:52:54,520 --> 00:52:56,549
IT'S MICHAEL.

714
00:53:08,434 --> 00:53:10,902
AS YOU ARE...

715
00:53:10,903 --> 00:53:13,831
I WAS.

716
00:53:16,209 --> 00:53:18,602
AS I AM...

717
00:53:21,581 --> 00:53:24,543
YOU WILL BE.

718
00:53:45,605 --> 00:53:47,930
MAYBE I'M NOT REAL.

719
00:53:50,076 --> 00:53:52,469
MAYBE I'M JUST
HAVING A NIGHTMARE...

720
00:53:54,714 --> 00:53:57,015
AN INCREDIBLY VIVID

721
00:53:57,016 --> 00:53:59,750
LUCID NIGHTMARE.

722
00:54:01,988 --> 00:54:04,848
WHEN IS THE LAST TIME
I REMEMBER GOING TO BED?

723
00:54:06,893 --> 00:54:09,127
I FLEW IN YESTERDAY.

724
00:54:09,962 --> 00:54:13,561
OR WAS THAT... TODAY?

725
00:54:14,267 --> 00:54:16,268
I CAN'T REMEMBER.

726
00:54:16,269 --> 00:54:18,560
WAS I ON A TRAIN?

727
00:54:21,808 --> 00:54:23,542
I WOKE UP SOMEWHERE

728
00:54:23,543 --> 00:54:25,644
AND I HAD BREAKFAST.

729
00:54:25,645 --> 00:54:28,778
WHERE WAS I?
WHAT DID I EAT?

730
00:54:36,455 --> 00:54:38,245
HERE IT COMES.

731
00:55:00,780 --> 00:55:03,982
THEY SAY YOU CAN'T DIE
IN YOUR DREAMS.

732
00:55:03,983 --> 00:55:05,807
IS THAT TRUE?

733
00:55:24,971 --> 00:55:28,763
THE SHOCK WOULD WAKE YOU UP.

734
00:55:33,045 --> 00:55:36,371
SO YOU COULDN'T REALLY DIE.

735
00:55:40,653 --> 00:55:42,554
ALL RIGHT, WHAT ARE OUR OPTIONS?

736
00:55:42,555 --> 00:55:46,057
GOT THE HALLWAY,
GOT GUEST ROOMS ON EITHER SIDE,

737
00:55:46,058 --> 00:55:49,194
STAIRWELL, FIRE EXITS.

738
00:55:49,195 --> 00:55:51,258
AND THAT'S THE NEXT WINDOW...

739
00:55:52,398 --> 00:55:54,188
THE NEXT ROOM.

740
00:55:55,368 --> 00:55:58,870
HOW MANY FEET ACROSS IS THAT?

741
00:55:58,871 --> 00:56:00,832
ONE...

742
00:56:02,475 --> 00:56:04,109
THREE,

743
00:56:04,110 --> 00:56:05,677
FOUR, FIVE,

744
00:56:05,678 --> 00:56:09,748
SIX, SEVEN, EIGHT...

745
00:56:09,749 --> 00:56:11,380
NINE.

746
00:56:12,084 --> 00:56:15,285
NINE, NINE...
18 FEET ACROSS.

747
00:56:17,757 --> 00:56:21,185
OKAY.
I CAN DO THIS.

748
00:56:26,499 --> 00:56:29,434
IF SOMETHING SHOULD HAPPEN,
IF I SHOULD SLIP AND FALL,

749
00:56:29,435 --> 00:56:32,898
I WANT IT TO BE KNOWN
THAT IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.

750
00:56:33,773 --> 00:56:35,740
THE ROOM...

751
00:56:35,741 --> 00:56:37,906
DID NOT WIN.

752
00:56:39,145 --> 00:56:40,812
OKAY.

753
00:56:40,813 --> 00:56:42,978
OKAY, I CAN DO THIS.

754
00:56:44,450 --> 00:56:46,149
18 LITTLE STEPS.

755
00:56:53,826 --> 00:56:55,827
FOUR...

756
00:56:55,828 --> 00:56:58,528
DON'T LOOK DOWN.
FIVE...

757
00:56:59,498 --> 00:57:01,698
KEEP MOVING.

758
00:57:05,805 --> 00:57:07,970
HERE WE GO.

759
00:57:13,346 --> 00:57:16,081
ALL RIGHT.
OKAY.

760
00:57:16,082 --> 00:57:17,782
NUMBER NINE...

761
00:57:17,783 --> 00:57:19,607
EIGHT...

762
00:57:21,187 --> 00:57:22,852
SIX...

763
00:57:26,459 --> 00:57:29,227
WHERE IS IT?
WHERE IS IT?

764
01:00:05,851 --> 01:00:07,352
GET AHOLD OF YOURSELF.

765
01:00:07,353 --> 01:00:09,746
YOU'RE RUNNING TO PLACES
THAT AREN'T REAL.

766
01:00:13,292 --> 01:00:15,753
HOTEL ROOMS ARE NATURALLY
CREEPY PLACES.

767
01:00:19,598 --> 01:00:22,696
STRANGELY, THE BEDROOM
HAS NO WINDOW.

768
01:00:24,069 --> 01:00:26,963
STRANGELY, THE BEDROOM HAS NO WINDOW...

769
01:00:29,642 --> 01:00:32,308
DR. EDWARDS TO ONCOLOGY.

770
01:00:34,647 --> 01:00:37,814
PLEASE, PLEASE.

771
01:00:44,123 --> 01:00:47,392
NO. NO. DOCTORS DON'T
KNOW EVERYTHING.

772
01:00:47,393 --> 01:00:49,394
WE CAN GET ANOTHER OPINION,
LOOK FOR OTHER TREATMENT.

773
01:00:49,395 --> 01:00:51,796
YOU HEAR ABOUT...
LOOK AT ME.

774
01:00:51,797 --> 01:00:53,364
MIRACLE CURES.
LILY.

775
01:00:53,365 --> 01:00:56,668
OH GOD.
PLEASE, SOMETHING.

776
01:00:56,669 --> 01:01:00,598
WHAT KIND OF GOD WOULD
DO THIS TO A LITTLE GIRL?

777
01:01:08,147 --> 01:01:10,481
KATIE.

778
01:01:10,482 --> 01:01:14,686
DADDY, I CAN'T SEE YOU.

779
01:01:14,687 --> 01:01:17,889
DADDY, I CAN'T FIND YOU.

780
01:01:17,890 --> 01:01:20,391
DADDY, I'M SCARED.

781
01:01:20,392 --> 01:01:22,961
KATIE.
I'M SCARED, DADDY.

782
01:01:22,962 --> 01:01:25,063

01:01:25,064 --> 01:01:26,831
HELP ME.

784
01:01:26,832 --> 01:01:28,997
DADDY, HELP ME.

785
01:02:05,804 --> 01:02:07,705
OKAY, HOW ABOUT THE WIRELESS?

786
01:02:07,706 --> 01:02:09,496
COME ON.

787
01:02:16,548 --> 01:02:18,916
GIVE ME A SIGNAL.
GIVE ME A SIGNAL.

788
01:02:18,917 --> 01:02:21,549
GOOD EVENING, MIKE.

789
01:02:22,354 --> 01:02:24,121
OH, YES!

790
01:02:25,190 --> 01:02:29,256
MIKE?

791
01:02:29,962 --> 01:02:31,663
MIKE, IS THAT...
IS THAT YOU?

792
01:02:31,664 --> 01:02:33,431
I CAN BARELY SEE YOU.
YES YES.

793
01:02:33,432 --> 01:02:36,901
IT'S LIKE SEEING A GHOST.
NO NO NO. YES, IT'S ME.

794
01:02:36,902 --> 01:02:38,770
IT'S ME. IT'S MIKE.
THIS IS A LITTLE BIZARRE.

795
01:02:38,771 --> 01:02:40,938
I MEAN, I HAVEN'T TALKED
TO YOU IN A YEAR

796
01:02:40,939 --> 01:02:43,041
AND SUDDENLY YOU POP UP
IN A BOX ON MY COMPUTER.

797
01:02:43,042 --> 01:02:45,410
I'M SORRY, LILY.
LISTEN TO ME, PLEASE, QUICKLY.

798
01:02:45,411 --> 01:02:48,046
LOOK, I'M AT WORK, OKAY? SO WHY DON'T
YOU CALL ME AT HOME TONIGHT?

799
01:02:48,047 --> 01:02:51,582
I'M TRAPPED IN THIS ROOM,
THIS PLACE.

800
01:02:51,583 --> 01:02:53,818
MIKE, YOU'RE ALWAYS TRAPPED IN WEIRD
PLACES. THAT'S YOUR JOB.

801
01:02:53,819 --> 01:02:55,720
NO NO, PLEASE, LILY. LISTEN TO ME.

802
01:02:55,721 --> 01:02:57,588
PLEASE.
LILY ENSLIN.

803
01:02:57,589 --> 01:02:59,590
HI. YEAH YEAH.
LILY!

804
01:02:59,591 --> 01:03:01,693
I'VE GOT THOSE. I'LL BE RIGHT DOWN.
NO. LILY!

805
01:03:01,694 --> 01:03:04,028
LILY, PLEASE!
CALL THE COPS.

806
01:03:04,029 --> 01:03:06,464
SEND THEM TO THE DOLPHIN HOTEL.

807
01:03:06,465 --> 01:03:08,494
I'LL CALL YOU BACK.

808
01:03:10,769 --> 01:03:13,004
YOU'RE IN THE CITY?
YES!

809
01:03:13,005 --> 01:03:15,540
2254 LEXINGTON.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN NEW YORK?

810
01:03:15,541 --> 01:03:19,010
I'LL TELL YOU LATER.
THE DOLPHIN HOTEL, ROOM 1408.

811
01:03:19,011 --> 01:03:21,012
THAT'S JUST PERFECT.
PLEASE.

812
01:03:21,013 --> 01:03:22,880
YOU WALK OUT, YOU DISAPPEAR.
LEAVING ME WHAT?

813
01:03:22,881 --> 01:03:25,183
NOT DIVORCED. SEPARATED?
I DON'T KNOW, IT'S NOT CLEAR.

814
01:03:25,184 --> 01:03:27,952
SUDDENLY YOU NEED ME?
LILY, I'M IN A REAL BAD SPOT HERE.

815
01:03:27,953 --> 01:03:30,755
I'M IN DANGER. YOU UNDERSTAND?
OKAY, MIKE. SLOW DOWN.

816
01:03:30,756 --> 01:03:32,023
YOU'RE NOT MAKING ANY SENSE.

817
01:03:32,024 --> 01:03:35,452
THERE'S SOMETHING TRYING
TO KILL ME RIGHT NOW.

818
01:03:39,064 --> 01:03:40,865
NO, LILY!

819
01:03:40,866 --> 01:03:43,293
NO NO NO!

820
01:04:43,996 --> 01:04:46,059
I'VE GOT A KNIFE!

821
01:05:01,380 --> 01:05:03,414
THAT'S THE WAY OUT.

822
01:05:03,415 --> 01:05:05,774
OR THAT WAY.
OR THAT WAY.

823
01:05:08,487 --> 01:05:09,981
ALL RIGHT, THAT'S THE WAY OUT.

824
01:05:11,223 --> 01:05:13,357
LADY, LET ME IN!

825
01:05:13,358 --> 01:05:17,128
HELP! HELP!
PLEASE, SLEEP.

826
01:05:17,129 --> 01:05:19,897
LADY, I'M COMING THROUGH!
MIKE!

827
01:05:19,898 --> 01:05:23,100
MIKE, CAN YOU HELP ME?
WHERE'D YOU GO?

828
01:05:23,101 --> 01:05:26,837
I GOT TO GET SOME CIGARETTES.
YOU WANT SOMETHING?

829
01:05:28,273 --> 01:05:30,939
JESUS CHRIST!

830
01:05:32,744 --> 01:05:34,512
I'VE GOT TO GO. I'LL BE IN CALIFORNIA.

831
01:05:34,513 --> 01:05:36,481
MIKE, YOU CAN'T DO THIS.

832
01:05:36,482 --> 01:05:38,749
SHE NEEDS YOU.
SHE LOST A KID TOO.

833
01:05:38,750 --> 01:05:41,252
YOU'VE GOT AN AMAZING TALENT
FOR STATING THE OBVIOUS, POP.

834
01:05:41,253 --> 01:05:42,520
YOU THINK I DON'T KNOW THAT?

835
01:05:42,521 --> 01:05:44,555
I'M TRYING TO TALK
SOME SENSE INTO YOUR HEAD!

836
01:05:44,556 --> 01:05:47,358
DON'T PUT YOUR HANDS ON ME, OLD MAN!
MIKE!

837
01:05:47,359 --> 01:05:50,528
TALK? WHY CHANGE WHAT APPEARS TO BE
THE HABIT OF A LIFETIME, POP?

838
01:05:50,529 --> 01:05:51,996
YOU WERE ALWAYS GREAT
AT PASSING JUDGMENT,

839
01:05:51,997 --> 01:05:53,931
BUT THE PROBLEM IS
YOU NEVER GAVE A SHIT.

840
01:05:53,932 --> 01:05:57,167
I NEVER GAVE A SHIT
BECAUSE YOU'RE A BULLSHIT WRITER!

841
01:06:01,440 --> 01:06:03,071
SHIT!

842
01:06:10,949 --> 01:06:12,773
HELLO!

843
01:06:17,789 --> 01:06:19,249
OH.

844
01:06:43,982 --> 01:06:45,647
KEVIN O'MALLEY.

845
01:06:56,128 --> 01:06:57,795
NO.

846
01:06:57,796 --> 01:07:00,064
NO NO NO NO NO NO.

847
01:07:00,866 --> 01:07:05,168
I CAN'T HELP YOU.

848
01:07:06,371 --> 01:07:09,231
NO!

849
01:08:05,097 --> 01:08:07,490
IT'S GOOD TO BE BACK.

850
01:08:12,004 --> 01:08:13,999
THAT'S ENOUGH OF THAT.

851
01:08:22,681 --> 01:08:24,778
ALCOHOL.

852
01:08:26,518 --> 01:08:28,619
I WAS JUST CHECKING TO SEE
IF THE ACCOMMODATIONS

853
01:08:28,620 --> 01:08:30,254
ARE EXCEEDING YOUR EXPECTATIONS.

854
01:08:30,255 --> 01:08:32,490
YOU KNOW GODDAMN WELL THEY ARE!

855
01:08:32,491 --> 01:08:35,393
WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME?
NO NO NO.

856
01:08:35,394 --> 01:08:37,762
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

857
01:08:37,763 --> 01:08:40,498
WHAT DO YOU WANT,
MR. ENSLIN?

858
01:08:40,499 --> 01:08:43,200
YOU SOUGHT THIS ROOM.
IT WAS A JOB. I WAS DOING THE JOB.

859
01:08:43,201 --> 01:08:45,269
I BEG YOUR PARDON?
MY JOB! I'M A WRITER.

860
01:08:45,270 --> 01:08:48,272
OH, THAT'S RIGHT.
YOU DON'T BELIEVE IN ANYTHING.

861
01:08:48,273 --> 01:08:50,007
YOU LIKE SHATTERING
PEOPLE'S HOPES.

862
01:08:50,008 --> 01:08:51,342
OH, THAT'S BULLSHIT!

863
01:08:51,343 --> 01:08:53,144
WHY DO YOU THINK PEOPLE
BELIEVE IN GHOSTS?

864
01:08:53,145 --> 01:08:55,546
FOR FUN?
NO.

865
01:08:55,547 --> 01:08:59,016
IT'S THE PROSPECT
OF SOMETHING AFTER DEATH.

866
01:08:59,017 --> 01:09:02,286
HOW MANY SPIRITS
HAVE YOU BROKEN?

867
01:09:02,287 --> 01:09:04,121
SHE WAS IN SO MUCH PAIN.

868
01:09:04,122 --> 01:09:06,223
I'M SURE SHE'S SMILING DOWN
ON US RIGHT NOW.

869
01:09:06,224 --> 01:09:09,226
WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME?

870
01:09:09,227 --> 01:09:10,561
HUH?

871
01:09:10,562 --> 01:09:13,631
WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME?

872
01:09:13,632 --> 01:09:15,593
YOU...

873
01:09:16,301 --> 01:09:17,898
YOU LITTLE...

874
01:09:20,639 --> 01:09:23,240
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

875
01:09:23,241 --> 01:09:25,532
WHAT?!

876
01:09:28,280 --> 01:09:32,380
I WANT MY DRINK!

877
01:09:43,762 --> 01:09:46,792
YOU WIN.
YOU WIN.

878
01:09:54,172 --> 01:09:56,006
MOMMY?
HMM?

879
01:09:56,007 --> 01:09:58,275
WHY IS THE BIBLE PURPLE?

880
01:09:58,276 --> 01:10:00,578
I DON'T KNOW WHY IT'S PURPLE.

881
01:10:00,579 --> 01:10:04,081
IT WAS A WEDDING PRESENT.

882
01:10:04,082 --> 01:10:06,617
MY GRANDMOTHER BROUGHT IT
ALL THE WAY FROM HUNGARY.

883
01:10:06,618 --> 01:10:08,545
SOMEDAY IT'LL BE YOURS.

884
01:10:11,890 --> 01:10:14,886
ARE THERE PEOPLE
WHERE I'M GOING?

885
01:10:18,597 --> 01:10:22,800
HEY, YOU'RE NOT
GOING ANYWHERE, KIDDO.

886
01:10:22,801 --> 01:10:24,435
YOU'RE GONNA STAY
RIGHT HERE WITH US.

887
01:10:24,436 --> 01:10:26,504
DADDY...

888
01:10:26,505 --> 01:10:29,103
EVERYONE DIES.

889
01:10:30,408 --> 01:10:32,777
WHEN THEY'RE OLD.

890
01:10:32,778 --> 01:10:34,411
WHEN THEY'RE MUCH OLDER.

891
01:10:34,412 --> 01:10:36,714
OKAY, AND THEN THEY GO
TO A BETTER PLACE.

892
01:10:36,715 --> 01:10:40,007
AND IT'S BEAUTIFUL THERE.

893
01:10:40,852 --> 01:10:42,983
AND ALL YOUR FRIENDS
WILL BE THERE.

894
01:10:48,493 --> 01:10:50,522
IS GOD THERE?

895
01:10:51,263 --> 01:10:52,689
YES.

896
01:10:54,032 --> 01:10:56,197
DO YOU REALLY
BELIEVE THAT, DADDY?

897
01:10:57,469 --> 01:10:59,532
YES.

898
01:11:01,740 --> 01:11:03,774
YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK!
WE SHOULD HAVE DONE MORE!

899
01:11:03,775 --> 01:11:05,476
WE DID EVERYTHING WE COULD!
NO, WE DIDN'T!

900
01:11:05,477 --> 01:11:07,778
WE SHOULD HAVE HELPED HER FIGHT...
OH MY GOD.

901
01:11:07,779 --> 01:11:10,047
INSTEAD OF FILLING HER HEAD FULL
OF THESE STORIES

902
01:11:10,048 --> 01:11:12,349
ABOUT HEAVENS
AND THE CLOUDS AND NIRVANA

903
01:11:12,350 --> 01:11:14,218
AND ALL THAT BULLSHIT!

904
01:11:14,219 --> 01:11:15,786
THOSE STORIES, SHE LIKE THEM.

905
01:11:15,787 --> 01:11:17,918
I'M GOING TO GET
SOME CIGARETTES, OKAY?

906
01:12:55,353 --> 01:12:58,522
WE PONDER THE SITUATION.

907
01:12:58,523 --> 01:13:02,156
I'M TRYING TO
ACCURATELY DESCRIBE...

908
01:13:03,128 --> 01:13:05,796
ORPHEUS ON THE ORPHEUM CIRCUIT

909
01:13:05,797 --> 01:13:07,831
BATHED IN TANGO LIGHT,

910
01:13:07,832 --> 01:13:11,397
THE KIND OF LIGHT
THAT MAKES THE DEAD...

911
01:13:12,370 --> 01:13:14,605
GET OUT OF THEIR GRAVES
AND TANGO.

912
01:13:14,606 --> 01:13:18,000
NOW THIS IS LEVEL NINE...

913
01:13:19,945 --> 01:13:21,946
THE DEEPEST LEVEL OF HELL,

914
01:13:21,947 --> 01:13:26,013
FURTHEST REMOVED
FROM ALL LIGHT AND WARMTH.

915
01:13:27,652 --> 01:13:29,620
THIS IS SIX.

916
01:13:29,621 --> 01:13:32,289
IT'S GODDAMN FIVE.

917
01:13:32,290 --> 01:13:34,491
I THINK I SEE THE PATTERN.

918
01:13:34,492 --> 01:13:37,795
YES, I CAN SEE THE PATTERN.

919
01:13:37,796 --> 01:13:39,229
MIKE.

920
01:13:39,230 --> 01:13:42,433
MIKE, CAN YOU HEAR ME?

921
01:13:42,434 --> 01:13:45,569
MICHAEL, WHERE THE HELL ARE YOU?
LILY.

922
01:13:45,570 --> 01:13:47,404
MICHAEL?

923
01:13:47,405 --> 01:13:49,473
MIKE.
LILY.

924
01:13:49,474 --> 01:13:52,276
MICHAEL, CAN YOU HEAR ME?

925
01:13:52,277 --> 01:13:54,067
LILY.

926
01:13:57,115 --> 01:13:59,984
OH MY GOD. THANK GOD.
JESUS, I'VE BEEN TRYING TO GET THROUGH!

927
01:13:59,985 --> 01:14:02,186
DID YOU CALL THE COPS?
YEAH YEAH, THEY'RE AT THE HOTEL.

928
01:14:02,187 --> 01:14:04,254
DIDN'T YOU SAY THE DOLPHIN?
YES.

929
01:14:04,255 --> 01:14:06,757
YOU'RE SURE?
YES YES, 1408.

930
01:14:06,758 --> 01:14:09,827
MIKE, THEY'RE IN 1408.

931
01:14:09,828 --> 01:14:11,695
THE ROOM'S EMPTY.

932
01:14:11,696 --> 01:14:13,361
MIKE?

933
01:14:14,299 --> 01:14:16,834
MICHAEL, CAN YOU HEAR ME?

934
01:14:16,835 --> 01:14:18,402
MICHAEL?

935
01:14:18,403 --> 01:14:20,471
MICHAEL, WHERE THE HELL ARE YOU?

936
01:14:20,472 --> 01:14:23,207
I'M AFRAID I CAN'T EXPRESS
MYSELF IN THIS CLIMATE.

937
01:14:23,208 --> 01:14:25,042
CALM DOWN, OKAY?
WE'LL FIGURE THIS OUT.

938
01:14:25,043 --> 01:14:27,144
DON'T PANIC.
I'M SUPPOSED TO DIE HERE.

939
01:14:27,145 --> 01:14:29,613
MICHAEL, STOP IT!
YOU'RE NOT GONNA DIE, OKAY?

940
01:14:29,614 --> 01:14:31,848
DON'T MOVE.
I CAN BE THERE IN 15 MINUTES.

941
01:14:34,886 --> 01:14:37,221
MIKE?
MICHAEL?

942
01:14:37,222 --> 01:14:40,391
15 MINUTES ISN'T ENOUGH TIME.

943
01:14:40,392 --> 01:14:42,826
IT'LL BE TOO LATE.
NO, IT WON'T BE TOO LATE.

944
01:14:42,827 --> 01:14:44,328
LILY.
DON'T...

945
01:14:44,329 --> 01:14:46,764
ACTUALLY, 15 MINUTES IS PERFECT.

946
01:14:46,765 --> 01:14:48,932
IT'S PERFECT.
JUST COME UP. COME NOW.

947
01:14:48,933 --> 01:14:50,300
GOOD, YES.
I NEED YOU.

948
01:14:50,301 --> 01:14:52,302
YOU'VE ALWAYS BEEN SOMEONE
I CAN COUNT ON.

949
01:14:52,303 --> 01:14:55,372
I KNOW WE HAVEN'T TALKED A LOT
SINCE... SINCE KATIE DIED,

950
01:14:55,373 --> 01:14:58,275
BUT I NEED YOU, SWEETIE.
WAIT!

951
01:14:58,276 --> 01:15:00,711
I CAN'T EXPLAIN IT HERE. YOU JUST HAVE
TO COME HERE AND TALK TO ME.

952
01:15:00,712 --> 01:15:01,879
I MISS YOU TOO, BUT...

953
01:15:01,880 --> 01:15:03,647
WHEN YOU GET HERE,
DON'T TALK TO ANYBODY.

954
01:15:03,648 --> 01:15:05,082
JUST COME STRAIGHT UP TO THE 14TH FLOOR.

955
01:15:05,083 --> 01:15:07,284
WALK THROUGH THE DOOR.
SHUT UP! SHUT UP!

956
01:15:07,285 --> 01:15:09,453
IT'S LIFE OR DEATH, SWEETIE.
DO NOT COME UP TO THE ROOM!

957
01:15:09,454 --> 01:15:11,188
OKAY.
DON'T COME UP TO THE ROOM!

958
01:15:11,189 --> 01:15:12,923
I NEED TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT KATIE.
DON'T! SHUT UP!

959
01:15:12,924 --> 01:15:15,025
LILY, DON'T LISTEN TO HIM!
YES, GOOD.

960
01:15:15,026 --> 01:15:17,607
IT'S A TRICK! DON'T COME UP HERE!
I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.

961
01:15:22,600 --> 01:15:25,232
LILY! LILY!

962
01:15:56,868 --> 01:16:00,035
MY BABY! MY BABY!

963
01:16:00,972 --> 01:16:03,807
SHE'S HEADING FOR THE ROCKS!

964
01:16:03,808 --> 01:16:07,339
I DON'T WANT TO DIE!

965
01:16:23,461 --> 01:16:25,996
OH GOD!

966
01:16:25,997 --> 01:16:28,390
MAN OVERBOARD!

967
01:16:33,471 --> 01:16:35,432
COME ON!

968
01:17:57,222 --> 01:17:59,523
ARE YOU OKAY, BUDDY?

969
01:17:59,524 --> 01:18:01,485
HEY, ARE YOU BREATHING?

970
01:18:02,994 --> 01:18:04,995
COME ON, TALK TO ME.

971
01:18:04,996 --> 01:18:07,696
YOU GUYS, GIVE ME A HAND HERE!

972
01:18:14,973 --> 01:18:18,401
DR. EDWARDS TO ONCOLOGY, PLEASE.

973
01:18:23,214 --> 01:18:25,749
HEY.

974
01:18:25,750 --> 01:18:28,143
HOW ARE YOU FEELING?

975
01:18:29,520 --> 01:18:31,588
AM I OUT?
YOU'RE OKAY. YOU'RE OKAY.

976
01:18:31,589 --> 01:18:32,923
LIE DOWN, LIE DOWN, LIE DOWN.

977
01:18:32,924 --> 01:18:35,092
LIE DOWN, LIE DOWN, LIE DOWN.
YOU'RE OKAY.

978
01:18:35,093 --> 01:18:36,693
YOU'RE IN THE HOSPITAL.

979
01:18:36,694 --> 01:18:38,895
HOSPITAL WHERE?
IN NEW YORK?

980
01:18:38,896 --> 01:18:40,364
NEW YORK?
NO NO, YOU'RE IN LA.

981
01:18:40,365 --> 01:18:43,367
YOU GOT HIT ON THE HEAD
WITH YOUR BOARD.

982
01:18:43,368 --> 01:18:45,329
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU STILL SURF.

983
01:18:46,471 --> 01:18:48,305
YOU FLEW HERE JUST FOR ME?

984
01:18:48,306 --> 01:18:51,341
YEAH. YEAH,
I WAS WORRIED.

985
01:18:51,342 --> 01:18:53,577
THEY CALLED.

986
01:18:53,578 --> 01:18:56,146
I THINK I'M STILL LISTED
AS YOUR NEXT OF KIN.

987
01:18:56,147 --> 01:18:58,615
OKAY, I'M NOT IN NEW YORK.

988
01:18:58,616 --> 01:19:01,384
I'M OUT.
WHY DO YOU KEEP SAYING THAT?

989
01:19:03,721 --> 01:19:05,956
I WAS IN NEW YORK.
I WAS TRAPPED.

990
01:19:05,957 --> 01:19:08,759
IN NEW YORK, I WAS DYING

991
01:19:08,760 --> 01:19:11,128
IN THIS KAFKAESQUE HOTEL,

992
01:19:11,129 --> 01:19:13,330
THE DOLPHIN.

993
01:19:13,331 --> 01:19:16,400
WHAT?
THE DOLPHIN HOTEL ON 45TH AND LEX.

994
01:19:16,401 --> 01:19:18,001
I SPOKE WITH YOU THERE.
45TH AND LEX?

995
01:19:18,002 --> 01:19:20,463
I CALLED YOU.
I'VE NEVER HEARD OF IT.

996
01:19:22,807 --> 01:19:26,599
YOU'RE GONNA BE OKAY.
YOU JUST NEED TO REST.

997
01:19:43,761 --> 01:19:47,326
OH, WE HAVE A WINNER.

998
01:19:49,100 --> 01:19:51,231
600 BUCKS.

999
01:20:02,347 --> 01:20:04,981
UNBELIEVABLE.

1000
01:20:04,982 --> 01:20:07,443
I CAN SEE WHY YOU LIVE HERE.

1001
01:20:13,691 --> 01:20:16,391
WHY DID YOU LEAVE?

1002
01:20:22,633 --> 01:20:25,168
BECAUSE EVERY TIME
I LOOKED AT YOU,

1003
01:20:25,169 --> 01:20:27,437
I SAW HER FACE.

1004
01:20:38,049 --> 01:20:40,083
I THINK IT'S PRETTY CLEAR.

1005
01:20:40,084 --> 01:20:41,985
I THINK IN THE DREAM
THE ROOM'S YOUR SUBCONSCIOUS

1006
01:20:41,986 --> 01:20:43,854
AND IT BROUGHT UP
A LOT OF STUFF.

1007
01:20:43,855 --> 01:20:45,689
THAT'S A GOOD THING FOR YOU.

1008
01:20:45,690 --> 01:20:47,758
BUT THIS WAS... I MEAN, I WAS DOWN
THE RABBIT HOLE.

1009
01:20:47,759 --> 01:20:50,193
I WAS RATTLED.
I WAS SHOOK UP.

1010
01:20:50,194 --> 01:20:52,095
AND I CAN'T SHAKE IT.
I THINK AFTER DINNER

1011
01:20:52,096 --> 01:20:53,597
YOU SHOULD DRIVE ME
BACK TO THE HOSPITAL,

1012
01:20:53,598 --> 01:20:56,799
CHECK ME INTO THE PSYCH UNIT.

1013
01:20:58,202 --> 01:21:00,337
YOU LOOK REALLY GREAT.

1014
01:21:00,338 --> 01:21:03,163
I CAN'T BELIEVE
I'M SITTING HERE WITH YOU.

1015
01:21:04,375 --> 01:21:05,942
TELL ME ABOUT IT.

1016
01:21:05,943 --> 01:21:08,178
IS EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT?
CAN I GET YOU ANYTHING ELSE?

1017
01:21:08,179 --> 01:21:11,515
I'LL HAVE ANOTHER
GLASS OF WINE, PLEASE.

1018
01:21:11,516 --> 01:21:14,376
THE SAME.

1019
01:21:16,354 --> 01:21:17,888
MIKE?

1020
01:21:17,889 --> 01:21:19,556
YEAH, I'LL HAVE
ANOTHER TEQUILA...

1021
01:21:19,557 --> 01:21:21,091
PATRON, CHILLED, DOUBLE.

1022
01:21:21,092 --> 01:21:22,950
BE RIGHT BACK.

1023
01:21:29,167 --> 01:21:31,526
KATIE WAS THERE.

1024
01:21:32,804 --> 01:21:34,537
MMM-HM.

1025
01:21:36,574 --> 01:21:38,175
CAN YOU IMAGINE

1026
01:21:38,176 --> 01:21:40,577
WHAT IT FEELS LIKE
TO HAVE THE SENSATION?

1027
01:21:40,578 --> 01:21:42,646
I MEAN, THE VERY REAL SENSATION

1028
01:21:42,647 --> 01:21:44,681
THAT I TALKED TO HER,
LIKE, TWO DAYS AGO?

1029
01:21:44,682 --> 01:21:47,484
I TALKED TO HER,
SAW HER, TOUCHED HER.

1030
01:21:47,485 --> 01:21:49,886
YEAH.

1031
01:21:49,887 --> 01:21:52,883
I SEE HER EVERY NIGHT
WHEN I SHUT MY EYES.

1032
01:21:54,392 --> 01:21:56,059
YEAH, BUT IT WAS SO VIVID.

1033
01:21:56,060 --> 01:21:59,196
IT WAS SO REAL.

1034
01:21:59,197 --> 01:22:01,131
MAYBE YOU SHOULD WRITE ABOUT IT.

1035
01:22:01,132 --> 01:22:03,767
ABOUT KATIE?
SHIT.

1036
01:22:03,768 --> 01:22:06,636
YOU ALWAYS WERE TOUGHER THAN ME.
WHY NOT?

1037
01:22:06,637 --> 01:22:09,929
SERIOUSLY, IT SOUNDS LIKE
YOU'RE READY TO DEAL WITH THIS STUFF.

1038
01:22:13,911 --> 01:22:16,645
CAN YOU STAY?

1039
01:22:25,756 --> 01:22:28,422
I'M SORRY.

1040
01:22:32,830 --> 01:22:35,432
OKAY, WE HAVE GOT 148.

1041
01:22:35,433 --> 01:22:37,968
148 IS GONNA BE RIGHT ABOUT...

1042
01:22:37,969 --> 01:22:40,770
UH-HUH.

1043
01:22:40,771 --> 01:22:44,131
SO IF YOU'D LIKE
TO SIGN ON THE LINE.

1044
01:22:45,843 --> 01:22:47,811
HEY!
HEY, MAN!

1045
01:22:47,812 --> 01:22:50,080
YOU'VE BEEN GONE A WHILE.

1046
01:22:50,081 --> 01:22:53,049
OH, BY THE WAY,
DUDE, I READ YOUR BOOK.

1047
01:22:53,050 --> 01:22:56,987
WHAT IS IT?
"10 MOST HAUNTED MOTELS," RIGHT?

1048
01:22:56,988 --> 01:22:59,188
THAT'S SOME SCARY SHIT.

1049
01:23:02,493 --> 01:23:05,489
SEE YOU AROUND.

1050
01:23:42,967 --> 01:23:44,768
DID I DROP A POSTCARD?

1051
01:23:44,769 --> 01:23:46,303
WHAT?
DID I?

1052
01:23:46,304 --> 01:23:47,871
HUH?
A POSTCARD.

1053
01:23:47,872 --> 01:23:50,766
NO, I THINK I WOULD
HAVE SEEN IT.

1054
01:23:53,077 --> 01:23:54,778
BUT IF I FIND IT,
I'LL PUT IT IN YOUR MAILBOX.

1055
01:23:54,779 --> 01:23:56,740
OKAY?

1056
01:24:26,877 --> 01:24:30,046
MY EXPERIENCE IN THE ROOM
WAS TERRIFYING,

1057
01:24:30,047 --> 01:24:33,583
A FRAGMENTED LOOP
OF UNEASE AND DESPAIR.

1058
01:24:33,584 --> 01:24:35,719
1408 WAS A HORRIBLE DREAM,

1059
01:24:35,720 --> 01:24:40,357
YET SOMEHOW
I AWOKE FROM IT RENEWED.

1060
01:24:40,358 --> 01:24:42,792
MIKEY! YOU SOUND HAPPY.

1061
01:24:42,793 --> 01:24:44,594
YOU'RE SCARING ME.
I WOULDN'T GO THAT FAR,

1062
01:24:44,595 --> 01:24:47,130
BUT I MUST SAY THAT THE WORK
IS JUST POURING OUT OF ME.

1063
01:24:47,131 --> 01:24:49,532
I THINK I'VE ACTUALLY
REINVENTED MYSELF

1064
01:24:49,533 --> 01:24:52,435
IN THE FORM OF A KIND
OF A FICTIONAL MEMOIR...

1065
01:24:52,436 --> 01:24:54,204
"AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF A NIGHTMARE:

1066
01:24:54,205 --> 01:24:56,706
TRUMAN CAPOTE MEETS H.R. GIGER."
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

1067
01:24:56,707 --> 01:24:59,542
I LOVE IT!
"'IN COLD BLOOD' WITH 'ALIENS!"'

1068
01:24:59,543 --> 01:25:01,911
THAT'S SEXY.
I WANNA PUT IT OUT TO AUCTION,

1069
01:25:01,912 --> 01:25:04,447
START A BIDDING WAR.
WHEN CAN I READ IT?

1070
01:25:04,448 --> 01:25:07,317
EASY, TIGER. ANY DAY NOW.
YOU'RE GONNA GET IT AS SOON AS I FINISH.

1071
01:25:07,318 --> 01:25:09,552
OKAY, MIKE.
LESS TALKING, MORE WRITING.

1072
01:25:09,553 --> 01:25:12,344
HEY, WHERE'S THAT DECAF?
I'M DYING HERE.

1073
01:25:38,649 --> 01:25:40,746
THANK YOU.

1074
01:25:54,065 --> 01:25:55,889
HEY, POP.

1075
01:26:03,507 --> 01:26:06,376
HOW ARE YOU DOING, OLD BOY?

1076
01:26:06,377 --> 01:26:09,846
CAN YOU HEAR ME?

1077
01:26:09,847 --> 01:26:12,342
I DON'T THINK SO.

1078
01:26:21,592 --> 01:26:23,293
I KNOW I HAVEN'T BEEN
HERE IN A FEW MONTHS,

1079
01:26:23,294 --> 01:26:26,096
BUT I JUST WANTED TO...

1080
01:26:26,097 --> 01:26:29,127
COME BY AND SEE
HOW YOU'RE DOING AND...

1081
01:26:30,801 --> 01:26:34,471
TELL YOU I WAS DOING OKAY.

1082
01:26:34,472 --> 01:26:38,367
DOING PRETTY GOOD, ACTUALLY.

1083
01:26:39,543 --> 01:26:43,046
I STARTED TALKING TO LILY AGAIN.

1084
01:26:43,047 --> 01:26:46,783
AND I WROTE A NEW BOOK,

1085
01:26:46,784 --> 01:26:49,917
WHICH I ACTUALLY THINK
YOU WOULD LIKE...

1086
01:26:51,789 --> 01:26:54,683
BELIEVE IT OR NOT.

1087
01:27:01,699 --> 01:27:03,466
MICHAEL.

1088
01:27:03,467 --> 01:27:06,669
DAD.

1089
01:27:06,670 --> 01:27:10,106
MICHAEL.

1090
01:27:10,107 --> 01:27:10,907
YEAH.

1091
01:27:23,854 --> 01:27:26,588
SO...

1092
01:27:31,195 --> 01:27:34,531
HEY, YOU CAN'T PARK THERE!
MOVE IT DOWN, WILL YOU?

1093
01:27:34,532 --> 01:27:37,967
HEY, I GOT A PACKAGE
I NEED TO OVERNIGHT.

1094
01:27:37,968 --> 01:27:41,171
IS THIS THE RIGHT FORM? I GOT TO GET
THIS TO NEW YORK BY TOMORROW MORNING.

1095
01:27:41,172 --> 01:27:43,099
I'M SORRY, SIR, BUT WE'RE CLOSED.

1096
01:27:47,878 --> 01:27:49,509
VERY WELL.

1097
01:30:03,013 --> 01:30:05,747
I WAS OUT.

1098
01:30:07,451 --> 01:30:09,319
IS THAT KATIE?

1099
01:30:09,320 --> 01:30:12,021
IS THAT KATIE?

1100
01:30:12,022 --> 01:30:14,654
I WAS OUT.

1101
01:30:19,730 --> 01:30:23,363
I WAS OUT!

1102
01:30:24,969 --> 01:30:27,103
I WAS OUT.
PLEASE, GOD.

1103
01:30:27,104 --> 01:30:30,100
I KNOW I WAS OUT.

1104
01:31:18,088 --> 01:31:20,583
YEAH.

1105
01:31:25,362 --> 01:31:27,527
OPEN IT.

1106
01:31:42,913 --> 01:31:45,782
ARE YAWNING UP WIDELY IN OUR PATH.

1107
01:31:45,783 --> 01:31:49,746
WE KNOW THE WAY
OF THE RIGHTEOUS MAN.

1108
01:31:53,390 --> 01:31:55,715
DADDY.

1109
01:31:59,129 --> 01:32:02,865
DADDY?
NO.

1110
01:32:02,866 --> 01:32:05,601
YOU'RE NOT KATIE.
I NEED HELP.

1111
01:32:05,602 --> 01:32:08,371
PLEASE.

1112
01:32:08,372 --> 01:32:09,739
YOU'RE NOT REAL.

1113
01:32:09,740 --> 01:32:11,207
I'M COLD.

1114
01:32:11,208 --> 01:32:14,409
YOU'RE NOT KATIE.
SO COLD.

1115
01:32:32,296 --> 01:32:34,223
I LOVE YOU, DADDY.

1116
01:32:35,632 --> 01:32:38,835
DON'T YOU LOVE ME ANYMORE?

1117
01:32:38,836 --> 01:32:41,400
OF COURSE I DO, SWEETHEART.

1118
01:32:42,739 --> 01:32:45,633
THERE WE GO.
I GOT YOU.

1119
01:32:46,810 --> 01:32:49,011
I GOT YOU NOW, KATIE.

1120
01:32:49,012 --> 01:32:52,115
OH MY GOD.
THEY WON'T LET ME STAY.

1121
01:32:52,116 --> 01:32:54,717
YES, THEY WILL.
THEY WON'T LET ME STAY.

1122
01:32:54,718 --> 01:32:56,619
WHAT?
THEY WON'T LET ME STAY.

1123
01:32:56,620 --> 01:32:59,989
NO NO NO NO NO. NOBODY'S EVER GOING
TO TAKE YOU AWAY AGAIN.

1124
01:32:59,990 --> 01:33:03,860
I GOT YOU NOW, KATIE.
OH MY GOD.

1125
01:33:03,861 --> 01:33:05,661
I'M NOT GONNA LET YOU GO.
DO YOU LOVE ME, DADDY?

1126
01:33:05,662 --> 01:33:08,131
OF COURSE I DO. I LOVE YOU MORE THAN
ANYTHING IN THE WORLD.

1127
01:33:08,132 --> 01:33:10,133
I WISH WE COULD STAY TOGETHER,

1128
01:33:10,134 --> 01:33:11,467
YOU, ME, AND MOMMY.

1129
01:33:11,468 --> 01:33:14,704
WE CAN, WE CAN.
I GOT YOU RIGHT HERE.

1130
01:33:14,705 --> 01:33:18,274
I GOT YOU RIGHT HERE, SWEETIE.
EVERYTHING'S FINE.

1131
01:33:18,275 --> 01:33:20,372
EVERYTHING IS FINE.

1132
01:33:37,561 --> 01:33:39,295
NO.
NO.

1133
01:33:39,296 --> 01:33:42,265
NO. NO.

1134
01:33:42,266 --> 01:33:44,500
YOU CAN'T TAKE HER TWICE.

1135
01:33:46,136 --> 01:33:48,097
YOU CAN'T.

1136
01:33:49,239 --> 01:33:52,241
NOT AGAIN.
PLEASE, GOD.

1137
01:33:52,242 --> 01:33:55,705
YOU CAN'T.

1138
01:33:56,647 --> 01:33:58,714
PLEASE.

1139
01:33:58,715 --> 01:34:00,716
NO!

1140
01:34:00,717 --> 01:34:02,585
NO.

1141
01:34:02,586 --> 01:34:05,878
YOU BASTARD.
WE FLY

1142
01:34:08,058 --> 01:34:13,229
SO MANY ROADS TO CHOOSE

1143
01:34:13,230 --> 01:34:18,834
WE START OUT WALKING
AND LEARN TO RUN

1144
01:34:18,835 --> 01:34:21,330
AND YET WE'VE JUST BEGUN...

1145
01:34:31,848 --> 01:34:33,482
YOU LITTLE...

1146
01:34:33,483 --> 01:34:35,051
WHERE IS IT?

1147
01:34:35,052 --> 01:34:37,582
WHERE?!
WHERE?!

1148
01:35:05,549 --> 01:35:10,853
WE'LL FIND A PLACE
WHERE THERE'S ROOM TO GROW

1149
01:35:10,854 --> 01:35:15,557
AND YES, WE'VE JUST BEGUN

1150
01:35:18,495 --> 01:35:22,595
SHARING HORIZONS
THAT ARE NEW TO US

1151
01:35:24,001 --> 01:35:29,005
WATCHING THE SIGNS ALONG THE WAY

1152
01:35:29,006 --> 01:35:32,503
TALKING IT OVER,
JUST THE TWO OF US.

1153
01:36:23,060 --> 01:36:24,927
WHY DON'T YOU JUST KILL ME?

1154
01:36:24,928 --> 01:36:26,829
BECAUSE ALL GUESTS OF THIS HOTEL

1155
01:36:26,830 --> 01:36:28,664
ENJOY FREE WILL,
MR. ENSLIN.

1156
01:36:28,665 --> 01:36:31,400
YOU CAN CHOOSE TO RELIVE THIS HOUR
OVER AND OVER,

1157
01:36:31,401 --> 01:36:34,966
OR YOU CAN TAKE ADVANTAGE
OF OUR EXPRESS CHECKOUT SYSTEM.

1158
01:37:05,836 --> 01:37:08,297
MR. ENSLIN?

1159
01:37:51,548 --> 01:37:54,339
ARE YOU READY TO CHECK OUT,
MR. ENSLIN?

1160
01:37:57,187 --> 01:37:59,321
NO.

1161
01:37:59,322 --> 01:38:01,783
NOT YOUR WAY.
I UNDERSTAND.

1162
01:38:07,330 --> 01:38:09,665
BY THE WAY, MR. ENSLIN,
YOUR WIFE JUST CALLED.

1163
01:38:09,666 --> 01:38:12,334
SHE'LL BE HERE IN FIVE MINUTES
AND WE'LL SEND HER STRAIGHT UP.

1164
01:38:12,335 --> 01:38:14,703
SHE'S NOT INVOLVED.

1165
01:38:14,704 --> 01:38:17,573
YOU CAN'T HAVE HER.

1166
01:38:17,574 --> 01:38:20,672
I'M DONE ARGUING WITH YOU.

1167
01:38:23,180 --> 01:38:24,980
I'M GONNA END THIS.

1168
01:38:24,981 --> 01:38:27,049
FIVE.
THIS IS FIVE.

1169
01:38:27,050 --> 01:38:30,085
IGNORE THE SIREN.
EVEN IF YOU LEAVE THIS ROOM,

1170
01:38:30,086 --> 01:38:32,555
YOU CAN NEVER LEAVE THIS ROOM.

1171
01:38:32,556 --> 01:38:36,459
EIGHT.
THIS IS EIGHT.

1172
01:38:36,460 --> 01:38:39,762
WE HAVE KILLED YOUR FRIENDS.

1173
01:38:39,763 --> 01:38:42,331
EVERY FRIEND

1174
01:38:42,332 --> 01:38:45,294
IS NOW DEAD.

1175
01:38:55,178 --> 01:38:58,714
I LIVED THE LIFE OF A SELFISH MAN.

1176
01:38:58,715 --> 01:39:02,416
BUT I DON'T HAVE
TO DIE THAT WAY.

1177
01:39:03,687 --> 01:39:05,120
IF I'M GOING DOWN,

1178
01:39:05,121 --> 01:39:08,584
I'M TAKING YOU WITH ME.

1179
01:39:11,461 --> 01:39:13,462
THIS MAY NOT ALL BE REAL,

1180
01:39:13,463 --> 01:39:16,165
AND I MAY NOT EVEN BE REAL,

1181
01:39:16,166 --> 01:39:18,764
BUT THIS FIRE...

1182
01:39:21,371 --> 01:39:24,003
THAT'S GOT TO BE REAL.

1183
01:39:33,884 --> 01:39:35,947
GO TO HELL!

1184
01:39:58,008 --> 01:39:59,508
GET OUT ONTO THE STREET!

1185
01:39:59,509 --> 01:40:01,577
OUT THE DOORS
AND ONTO THE STREET, PLEASE.

1186
01:40:01,578 --> 01:40:04,278
EVERYONE STAY CALM.

1187
01:40:07,217 --> 01:40:10,352
WHAT'S GOING ON?
I DON'T KNOW, LADY.

1188
01:40:10,353 --> 01:40:13,622
THIS MIGHT TAKE A WHILE.
SOMETHING MUST HAVE HAPPENED.

1189
01:40:13,623 --> 01:40:16,289
THANKS.

1190
01:40:23,767 --> 01:40:27,366
KEEP QUIET, YOU BASTARD.

1191
01:40:28,872 --> 01:40:30,739
PLEASE, YOU'VE GOTTA HELP ME.
NO, HELP ME.

1192
01:40:30,740 --> 01:40:32,141
CALM DOWN.
MY HUSBAND'S INSIDE.

1193
01:40:32,142 --> 01:40:34,243
MY HUSBAND'S INSIDE.
YOU'VE GOTTA HELP HIM.

1194
01:40:34,244 --> 01:40:36,045
YOU'VE GOTTA HELP HIM, PLEASE!

1195
01:40:36,046 --> 01:40:37,479
WHAT FLOOR?
WHAT FLOOR?

1196
01:40:37,480 --> 01:40:39,648
14TH FLOOR, 1408.
MIKE ENSLIN.

1197
01:40:39,649 --> 01:40:42,117
PLEASE COME HERE.

1198
01:40:42,118 --> 01:40:46,218
YOU'RE WASTING YOUR TIME.

1199
01:40:51,428 --> 01:40:54,063
WE'RE HERE TO DO THE JOB,

1200
01:40:54,064 --> 01:40:56,491
AND WE DON'T RATTLE.

1201
01:40:59,636 --> 01:41:02,404
THE DECOR IS IN TATTERS

1202
01:41:02,405 --> 01:41:04,340
AND THE STAFF SURLY.

1203
01:41:04,341 --> 01:41:07,576
BUT ON THE SHIVER SCALE...

1204
01:41:08,678 --> 01:41:12,243
I AWARD THE DOLPHIN 10 SKULLS!

1205
01:41:35,805 --> 01:41:38,972
NEVER KILL
MORE THAN YOU CAN EAT.

1206
01:41:47,550 --> 01:41:50,978
DADDY, EVERYONE DIES.

1207
01:42:21,384 --> 01:42:24,653
WE COMMEND TO ALMIGHTY GOD
OUR BROTHER,

1208
01:42:24,654 --> 01:42:27,756
AND WE COMMIT HIS BODY
TO THE GROUND,

1209
01:42:27,757 --> 01:42:31,360
EARTH TO EARTH, ASHES TO ASHES,

1210
01:42:31,361 --> 01:42:34,963
DUST TO DUST.

1211
01:42:34,964 --> 01:42:36,665
MAY YOU REST IN PEACE.

1212
01:42:36,666 --> 01:42:38,500
AMEN.

1213
01:42:38,501 --> 01:42:40,269
AMEN.

1214
01:42:40,270 --> 01:42:43,038
WELL, THEY'RE TOGETHER NOW.

1215
01:42:46,910 --> 01:42:49,474
LET'S GO.

1216
01:42:56,619 --> 01:42:59,114
MRS. ENSLIN?

1217
01:43:03,159 --> 01:43:05,694
I...

1218
01:43:05,695 --> 01:43:08,097
I AM SORRY TO INTRUDE AT SUCH
A DELICATE TIME,

1219
01:43:08,098 --> 01:43:10,933
BUT I KNEW YOUR HUSBAND.
I WORKED AT THE DOLPHIN.

1220
01:43:10,934 --> 01:43:12,935
OH.

1221
01:43:12,936 --> 01:43:15,838
WHILE WE WERE CLEANING UP,
WE CAME ACROSS SOME OF HIS BELONGINGS.

1222
01:43:15,839 --> 01:43:18,240
NO, THANK YOU.

1223
01:43:18,241 --> 01:43:20,275
THEY ARE OF SUCH
A PERSONAL NATURE, MA'AM.

1224
01:43:20,276 --> 01:43:22,444
I FIGURED MAYBE YOU WOULD WANT TO...
NO, PLEASE.

1225
01:43:22,445 --> 01:43:24,680
IT'S NOT HOW
I WANT TO REMEMBER HIM.

1226
01:43:24,681 --> 01:43:27,116
I'M SURE YOU UNDERSTAND.

1227
01:43:27,117 --> 01:43:28,817
OH YES, YES.
OF COURSE I UNDERSTAND.

1228
01:43:28,818 --> 01:43:31,520
BUT IT'S IMPORTANT THAT YOU KNOW
THAT HE DID A GREAT THING.

1229
01:43:31,521 --> 01:43:33,756
HE DID NOT DIE IN VAIN.

1230
01:43:33,757 --> 01:43:36,091
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

1231
01:43:36,092 --> 01:43:38,293
BECAUSE OF HIM,
THE ROOM WON'T REOPEN. IT'S BEEN...

1232
01:43:38,294 --> 01:43:40,429
ALL RIGHT, OKAY, STOP.

1233
01:43:40,430 --> 01:43:43,298
JUST GIVE THE LADY SOME AIR.

1234
01:43:43,299 --> 01:43:45,829
SHE'S BEEN THROUGH ENOUGH,
DON'T YOU THINK?

1235
01:44:30,280 --> 01:44:32,347
ROUND ONE GOES TO THE HIDEOUS MR. OLIN

1236
01:44:32,348 --> 01:44:33,682
FOR EFFECTIVE AGGRESSIVENESS.

1237
01:44:33,683 --> 01:44:36,151
I HAVE TO ADMIT,
HE HAD ME GOING.

1238
01:44:36,152 --> 01:44:37,619
GET AHOLD OF YOURSELF.

1239
01:44:37,620 --> 01:44:40,322
YOU'RE RUNNING TO PLACES
THAT AREN'T REAL.

1240
01:44:40,323 --> 01:44:41,890
DADDY,

1241
01:44:41,891 --> 01:44:43,926
DON'T YOU LOVE ME ANYMORE?

1242
01:44:43,927 --> 01:44:46,094
OF COURSE I DO, SWEETHEART.

1243
01:44:46,095 --> 01:44:48,697
DON'T YOU LOVE ME, DADDY?
OF COURSE I DO, HONEY,

1244
01:44:48,698 --> 01:44:50,933
MORE THAN ANYTHING.
I GOT YOU NOW.

1245
01:44:50,934 --> 01:44:53,602
I GOT YOU RIGHT HERE, SWEETIE.
EVERYTHING'S FINE.

1246
01:44:53,603 --> 01:44:57,005
I GOT YOU, KATIE.
NOBODY'S EVER GONNA TAKE YOU AWAY AGAIN.

1247
01:44:57,006 --> 01:44:58,841
DADDY?

1248
01:44:58,842 --> 01:45:01,944
DADDY!
DADDY!

1249
01:45:01,945 --> 01:45:02,745
DADDY!

1250
01:45:14,824 --> 01:45:16,682
HEY, SWEETIE.

1251
01:46:16,886 --> 01:46:19,087
DADDY!

1252
01:46:19,088 --> 01:46:22,124
DADDY!

1253
01:46:22,125 --> 01:46:24,893
YES, OF COURSE.
