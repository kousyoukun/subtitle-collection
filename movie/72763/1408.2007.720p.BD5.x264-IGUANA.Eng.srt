1
00:00:20,178 --> 00:00:23,477
(rain pattering)

2
00:00:24,616 --> 00:00:26,607
(thunder rumbles)

3
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:45,301
Preacher on radio: Reckless sinful
way throughout this life.

4
00:00:45,336 --> 00:00:46,769
The Lord has told me

5
00:00:46,805 --> 00:00:49,103
that the open
gates of Hell

6
00:00:49,602 --> 00:00:52,298
are yawning up
widely in our path.

7
00:00:52,338 --> 00:00:54,203
Yes, the flames

8
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:56,333
of perpetual damnation

9
00:00:56,376 --> 00:00:59,345
are ever ready to grasp
our souls.

10
00:00:59,379 --> 00:01:02,507
We know the way
of the righteous man.

11
00:01:02,548 --> 00:01:04,607
Yeah, we know the prayer

12
00:01:04,651 --> 00:01:06,312
of the righteous man.

13
00:01:15,595 --> 00:01:18,860
I'm telling you
that the Lord has spoken.

14
00:01:18,898 --> 00:01:22,026
Yes, the Lord has spoken
to me.

15
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:39,311
(bell rings)

16
00:01:46,192 --> 00:01:47,955
Hi.

17
00:01:47,994 --> 00:01:50,053
Mike Enslin.
Checking in.

18
00:01:50,096 --> 00:01:52,621
Honey.
Mr. Enslin.

19
00:01:52,665 --> 00:01:54,223
We were afraid you
weren't going to show.

20
00:01:54,267 --> 00:01:56,963
Oh it's such an honor
to have you here.

21
00:01:57,003 --> 00:01:58,868
- Terrible night out there.
- If I could just get the key,

22
00:01:58,905 --> 00:02:00,600
I'll settle in and we can
talk in the morning after...

23
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,733
You probably want to hear
all about our haunted history.

24
00:02:02,775 --> 00:02:05,073
Well, this staircase here,
this is where the maid

25
00:02:05,111 --> 00:02:07,409
reputedly hung herself
in 1860.

26
00:02:07,447 --> 00:02:08,880
- Oh.
- There's a picture!

27
00:02:08,915 --> 00:02:10,405
- Can we do this in the morning?
- Wait wait.

28
00:02:10,450 --> 00:02:12,315
It's printed in
our brochure.

29
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:13,842
- Did we send you one of these?
- Uh, probably did.

30
00:02:13,886 --> 00:02:16,582
- Do you see her in the window?
- Yeah, there she is.

31
00:02:16,622 --> 00:02:19,614
That's a photo that
a guest took in 1986.

32
00:02:19,659 --> 00:02:21,627
In your letter
you mentioned that the rooms

33
00:02:21,661 --> 00:02:23,629
with the most
paranormal activity

34
00:02:23,663 --> 00:02:25,688
were in the attic.
Could I have one of those rooms?

35
00:02:25,732 --> 00:02:28,200
That's right, because the attic
is on the third floor

36
00:02:28,234 --> 00:02:30,361
which is the former
servant's quarters.

37
00:02:30,403 --> 00:02:32,837
People say that all
of Sylvia's children

38
00:02:32,872 --> 00:02:35,739
died up there
of tuberculosis.

39
00:02:35,775 --> 00:02:38,608
- All of them?
- Guests have reported strange sounds.

40
00:02:38,644 --> 00:02:41,238
At the stroke of midnight
there's been weird noises.

41
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,908
Now our best advice
is to lock your door from the inside.

42
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:45,611
- Isn't that right, honey?
- That's right.

43
00:02:45,651 --> 00:02:48,211
You take care, you just
lock it from the inside.

44
00:02:48,254 --> 00:02:49,983
I will.

45
00:02:50,022 --> 00:02:51,853
As soon as you
give me the key.

46
00:02:53,292 --> 00:02:55,021
(laughs)

47
00:02:55,061 --> 00:02:57,427
I'm so... right.
Got it right here.

48
00:02:57,463 --> 00:03:00,364
- Number 14, you can't miss it.
- Been a long drive.

49
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,368
- Good luck.
- All right, we'll see

50
00:03:02,402 --> 00:03:04,529
what the night brings.

51
00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:07,471
(thunder rumbling)

52
00:03:19,085 --> 00:03:21,076
(door creaks)

53
00:03:22,622 --> 00:03:25,113
(bottles clank)

54
00:04:15,675 --> 00:04:16,972
(birds chirping)

55
00:04:17,009 --> 00:04:18,203
Mike:
Mrs. Clark, the proprietor,

56
00:04:18,244 --> 00:04:19,905
says she hasn't
slept a night

57
00:04:19,946 --> 00:04:22,779
since acquiring the inn
and I believe her.

58
00:04:22,815 --> 00:04:25,147
No no no,
I pity her.

59
00:04:25,184 --> 00:04:27,846
But in any case, the eggs
Benedict are delicious

60
00:04:27,887 --> 00:04:30,014
and if you call in advance,
Mrs. Clark says

61
00:04:30,056 --> 00:04:33,617
she will bake her famous
flourless chocolate cake.

62
00:04:33,659 --> 00:04:37,652
On a Shiver Scale, I award the Weeping
Beach Inn six skulls.

63
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,792
Screw 'em, five skulls.

64
00:04:42,835 --> 00:04:44,325
(truck horn blares)

65
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:46,463
(traffic noise)

66
00:04:54,747 --> 00:04:57,045
- Hi.
- Oh hey.

67
00:04:57,083 --> 00:04:59,745
How's it going?
Can I help you?

68
00:04:59,785 --> 00:05:01,218
Yeah, I'm here
for the big event.

69
00:05:01,254 --> 00:05:05,020
All right.
Cool.

70
00:05:05,057 --> 00:05:06,388
I'm Mike Enslin.

71
00:05:06,425 --> 00:05:08,518
Sorry?

72
00:05:09,896 --> 00:05:11,261
- Book signing.
- Oh, right.

73
00:05:11,297 --> 00:05:14,755
Oh, that's you, yeah.
I see the resemblance, yeah.

74
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,859
- That's a good picture.
- Thanks, man.

75
00:05:16,903 --> 00:05:18,461
All right, hold on.

76
00:05:18,504 --> 00:05:21,632
Um... attention,
book lovers.

77
00:05:21,674 --> 00:05:25,132
Tonight we have noted
occult writer

78
00:05:25,177 --> 00:05:27,008
Michael Enslin

79
00:05:27,046 --> 00:05:29,776
at the Author's Corner
tonight.

80
00:05:29,815 --> 00:05:33,080
He's the writer of the best-selling
ghost survival guides,

81
00:05:33,119 --> 00:05:36,452
um... with such titles
as "10 Haunted Hotels,"

82
00:05:36,489 --> 00:05:39,617
"10 Haunted Graveyards,"

83
00:05:39,659 --> 00:05:41,217
"10 Haunted Lighthouses."

84
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:43,694
That's tonight, 7:00 pm.

85
00:05:43,729 --> 00:05:45,993
Mike: Anyway, so I really
enjoyed writing it,

86
00:05:46,032 --> 00:05:47,966
and that's kind of
a history of the book.

87
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,094
And I hope you enjoy it,
or enjoyed it.

88
00:05:51,137 --> 00:05:53,628
Uh, you know,
stay scared.

89
00:05:53,673 --> 00:05:55,072
Right?
Any questions?

90
00:05:55,107 --> 00:05:57,405
Where's the scariest place
you've ever been?

91
00:05:57,443 --> 00:05:59,570
Scariest place
I've ever been?

92
00:05:59,612 --> 00:06:01,603
Uh, I've never heard
that question before.

93
00:06:01,647 --> 00:06:03,842
- That's a joke.
- (chuckles)

94
00:06:03,883 --> 00:06:06,215
Well, all these places have
very colorful histories.

95
00:06:06,252 --> 00:06:07,810
Um...

96
00:06:07,853 --> 00:06:09,946
I would say, if I had to
pick a top one,

97
00:06:09,989 --> 00:06:11,980
I would say
Bar Harbor,

98
00:06:12,024 --> 00:06:15,050
the site of the grisly
McTeig wedding night murders.

99
00:06:15,094 --> 00:06:17,790
That's an intense place.
Or maybe St. Cloud, Minnesota,

100
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:20,731
where the crazed war widow
threw her baby down a well.

101
00:06:20,766 --> 00:06:23,098
I mean, those all have a lot
of... I mean, it's thick.

102
00:06:23,135 --> 00:06:25,933
- The air is thick.
- What about poltergeists?

103
00:06:25,972 --> 00:06:28,839
Look, I'm a good researcher.
I go into every gig locked and loaded.

104
00:06:28,874 --> 00:06:32,105
I travel with an EMF meter,
full-range spectrometer,

105
00:06:32,144 --> 00:06:34,840
infrared camera. I mean, look,
nothing would make me happier

106
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,814
than to experience
a paranormal event,

107
00:06:36,849 --> 00:06:39,579
you know, to get a glimpse
of the elusive light

108
00:06:39,619 --> 00:06:40,984
at the end of the tunnel.

109
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:42,851
(thunder crashes)

110
00:06:42,888 --> 00:06:45,186
So you're saying there's
no such thing as ghosts?

111
00:06:46,325 --> 00:06:47,986
I'm saying
I've never seen one,

112
00:06:48,027 --> 00:06:50,393
but they're awful convenient
for desperate hotels

113
00:06:50,429 --> 00:06:52,624
- when the interstate moves away.
- (knocking)

114
00:06:52,665 --> 00:06:55,361
This thing has really
gone off the rails. Who has a pen?

115
00:06:55,401 --> 00:06:57,961
- I do.
- Which one?

116
00:06:58,004 --> 00:07:01,235
Uh, but seriously, Mike,
if I want to see a real live ghost,

117
00:07:01,273 --> 00:07:03,036
where's my best bet?

118
00:07:03,075 --> 00:07:04,372
- Guaranteed?
- Yeah.

119
00:07:04,410 --> 00:07:05,968
Haunted Mansion,
Orlando.

120
00:07:06,012 --> 00:07:08,207
Awesome, thanks.

121
00:07:09,215 --> 00:07:10,807
- Stay scared.
- Thank you.

122
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:12,681
Cashier:
Hey, Ray, can you lock up?

123
00:07:12,718 --> 00:07:15,653
I got band practice tonight.

124
00:07:15,688 --> 00:07:17,315
Holy shit.

125
00:07:17,356 --> 00:07:18,846
What rock did you
find that under?

126
00:07:18,891 --> 00:07:20,916
- Um, eBay.
- EBay, huh?

127
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,985
- (girl laughs)
- How much did it go for?

128
00:07:23,029 --> 00:07:25,554
Well, there weren't
many bidders.

129
00:07:25,598 --> 00:07:28,032
I would think not.

130
00:07:28,067 --> 00:07:31,036
- Wow.
- But it's, um...

131
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:32,799
- an amazing book.
- Oh.

132
00:07:32,838 --> 00:07:35,602
Um, so... unique

133
00:07:35,641 --> 00:07:38,576
and inspirational
and honest.

134
00:07:38,611 --> 00:07:40,306
Thanks.
What's your name?

135
00:07:40,346 --> 00:07:42,371
- Um, Anna.
- Okay, Anna.

136
00:07:42,415 --> 00:07:44,508
Are you gonna write another
one like this one?

137
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:46,381
Nah, it's
a different guy.

138
00:07:46,419 --> 00:07:48,387
Um...

139
00:07:48,421 --> 00:07:50,389
- can I ask you a question?
- Sure.

140
00:07:50,423 --> 00:07:53,756
Um, the relationship
in the book

141
00:07:53,793 --> 00:07:56,489
with the father and the son...
it's probably too personal,

142
00:07:56,529 --> 00:08:00,124
- but, um, it's so authentic and...
- Mm-hm.

143
00:08:00,166 --> 00:08:02,726
Well-constructed,
and...

144
00:08:02,768 --> 00:08:05,669
is it true?

145
00:08:05,705 --> 00:08:08,333
No.

146
00:08:08,374 --> 00:08:10,535
Well, thank you for this.
I really appreciate it.

147
00:08:10,576 --> 00:08:11,941
My pleasure.

148
00:08:11,977 --> 00:08:13,535
Bye.

149
00:08:22,621 --> 00:08:24,589
(dog barks)

150
00:08:29,995 --> 00:08:32,429
- Man: Good boy!
- Man #2: Yo, homey...

151
00:08:32,465 --> 00:08:34,592
Woman:
Just a minute, Tiffany!

152
00:08:34,633 --> 00:08:36,897
Yeah, I'm just gonna tie it
inside my suit here.

153
00:09:08,534 --> 00:09:11,230
(airplane buzzes)

154
00:09:35,594 --> 00:09:37,585
Man:
Yo, Greg, check him out!

155
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:39,359
Woman:
Did you see what happened?

156
00:09:39,398 --> 00:09:41,263
Oh yeah.

157
00:09:42,635 --> 00:09:45,126
Are you okay, buddy?

158
00:09:45,171 --> 00:09:48,163
- Hey, are you breathing?
- (coughs)

159
00:09:48,207 --> 00:09:48,307
(laughter)

160
00:09:48,307 --> 00:09:50,537
(laughter)

161
00:09:52,711 --> 00:09:54,975
- Woman: No!
- Man: Serious as a heart attack.

162
00:09:55,014 --> 00:09:58,142
- (horn honks)
- (seagulls squawking)

163
00:10:00,653 --> 00:10:05,317
We got 325.
That is back here, I think.

164
00:10:05,357 --> 00:10:07,120
Uh-huh.

165
00:10:07,159 --> 00:10:09,957
This is the one.
Sign on the line, please, sir.

166
00:10:09,995 --> 00:10:11,553
Oh, you mean
right here?

167
00:10:11,597 --> 00:10:14,430
- Have yourself a beautiful day.
- Thank you.

168
00:10:14,466 --> 00:10:16,730
- Thank you very much.
- Hey, man, you've been gone a while.

169
00:10:16,769 --> 00:10:19,067
- Hey, Jackson, what's up?
- Oh by the way, dude,

170
00:10:19,104 --> 00:10:22,073
I read your last book...
the "10 Haunted Mansions" thing.

171
00:10:22,107 --> 00:10:23,699
Man, that's some
scary shit.

172
00:10:23,742 --> 00:10:26,040
Cool.

173
00:10:26,078 --> 00:10:27,705
Later on, dude.

174
00:10:27,746 --> 00:10:31,477
(soft rock playing)

175
00:10:31,517 --> 00:10:33,109
- Hi.
- Hi, how you doing?

176
00:10:33,152 --> 00:10:35,313
- Hi.
- Good.

177
00:10:35,354 --> 00:10:37,185
Thanks.

178
00:10:42,761 --> 00:10:45,753
(customers chatting)

179
00:11:24,069 --> 00:11:25,866
That's cute.

180
00:11:25,905 --> 00:11:29,102
Woman: Good evening,
Dolphin Hotel.

181
00:11:29,141 --> 00:11:30,665
How might I direct
your call?

182
00:11:30,709 --> 00:11:32,574
Mike:
Yeah, hi, I'm calling about room 1408.

183
00:11:32,611 --> 00:11:34,374
One moment please, sir.

184
00:11:36,415 --> 00:11:37,746
Man:
How may I help you?

185
00:11:37,783 --> 00:11:40,274
Yeah, I'd like to stay in
room 1408 please.

186
00:11:40,319 --> 00:11:43,777
That room is
unavailable, sir.

187
00:11:43,822 --> 00:11:46,154
I didn't tell you
which date.

188
00:11:48,027 --> 00:11:49,426
How about Saturday?

189
00:11:49,461 --> 00:11:51,224
It's unavailable.

190
00:11:53,365 --> 00:11:56,198
(laughs)
The following Tuesday?

191
00:11:56,235 --> 00:11:57,964
Unavailable.

192
00:11:58,003 --> 00:11:59,766
Next month?

193
00:11:59,805 --> 00:12:01,272
Unavailable.

194
00:12:01,307 --> 00:12:03,502
Next summer?

195
00:12:03,542 --> 00:12:05,533
(hangs up)

196
00:12:29,468 --> 00:12:32,369
Man: Somebody, anybody,
where's good Chinese near 48th?

197
00:12:32,404 --> 00:12:34,702
I got to have lunch with
that idiot from Random House. Anybody?

198
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:36,731
Sam, Mike Enslin calling
from Los Angeles again.

199
00:12:36,775 --> 00:12:39,175
I'll take it in there.

200
00:12:39,211 --> 00:12:40,644
Clay, you got a sec for
Mike Enslin?

201
00:12:40,679 --> 00:12:42,146
- Say yes.
- Yes.

202
00:12:42,181 --> 00:12:44,706
Great. Now look, this guy
tends to get a little morose,

203
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:47,014
so try to keep the energy up.
Otherwise he stews in his own funk.

204
00:12:47,052 --> 00:12:48,349
- Mike!
- Mike: Hey, Sam.

205
00:12:48,387 --> 00:12:50,514
Hey hey, read the first
five chapters last night.

206
00:12:50,556 --> 00:12:52,183
Spooky shit,
couldn't sleep a wink.

207
00:12:52,224 --> 00:12:54,158
Great. Hey, did you take care
of that thing?

208
00:12:54,193 --> 00:12:57,162
You'd better believe I did.
And I got our top lawyer here right now.

209
00:12:57,196 --> 00:12:58,322
Mike, Clay,
Clay, Mike.

210
00:12:58,364 --> 00:12:59,592
- Hi, Clay.
- Mike.

211
00:12:59,631 --> 00:13:01,496
Talk fast, all right?
This guy's $400 an hour.

212
00:13:01,533 --> 00:13:03,023
All right, Clay,
what's up with the Dolphin?

213
00:13:03,068 --> 00:13:04,467
Yeah, the Dolphin.

214
00:13:04,503 --> 00:13:07,063
That stick-up-its-ass
relic on Lexington.

215
00:13:07,106 --> 00:13:09,131
Too posh for
a free plug, right?

216
00:13:09,174 --> 00:13:11,438
Well, you are gonna love
what Clay's cooked up.

217
00:13:11,477 --> 00:13:14,002
He dug around and found you...
are you sitting down?

218
00:13:14,046 --> 00:13:16,480
- A Federal
Civil Rights law.

219
00:13:16,515 --> 00:13:18,540
Like somebody would
discriminate against you,

220
00:13:18,584 --> 00:13:21,678
a well-to-do white guy.
But the law's the law, right, Clay?

221
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,381
Ergo, if the room's
not occupied

222
00:13:23,422 --> 00:13:25,390
- they have to give it to you.
- Really?

223
00:13:25,424 --> 00:13:27,688
Yeah. Now look, the manager there's
gonna put up a stink

224
00:13:27,726 --> 00:13:28,954
but he knows the drill.

225
00:13:28,994 --> 00:13:30,393
- Nothing you can't handle.
- So, Mike...

226
00:13:30,429 --> 00:13:31,953
we'll book the room
and if they refuse

227
00:13:31,997 --> 00:13:33,862
we'll rattle our sabers
and file suit.

228
00:13:33,899 --> 00:13:36,367
- So it's all done?
- Thanks, Clay. Get lost, all right?

229
00:13:36,402 --> 00:13:38,461
Bye, Clay.

230
00:13:38,504 --> 00:13:40,836
Yeah, Mike,
are you there?

231
00:13:40,873 --> 00:13:44,240
Yeah, uh, on a more
personal note,

232
00:13:44,276 --> 00:13:45,800
are you sure
you want to come here?

233
00:13:45,844 --> 00:13:48,711
Yeah, of course. It'll make a solid
closing chapter of the book.

234
00:13:48,747 --> 00:13:51,443
Yeah yeah,
I know the routine.

235
00:13:51,483 --> 00:13:54,475
But, I mean,
it's New York.

236
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:57,421
All that happened... you really want
to put yourself through that?

237
00:13:57,456 --> 00:13:59,754
- I'll be quick.
- Are you gonna call Lily?

238
00:13:59,792 --> 00:14:02,761
No.
I don't want to impose.

239
00:14:02,795 --> 00:14:05,889
In and out.
Nobody gets hurt.

240
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:10,664
It's just a job.

241
00:14:17,042 --> 00:14:19,738
(traffic noise)

242
00:14:21,413 --> 00:14:23,108
Driver:
Here you are, Dolphin.

243
00:14:24,650 --> 00:14:26,777
Man:
Hey! Taxi!

244
00:14:33,992 --> 00:14:36,825
(siren wails)

245
00:14:45,771 --> 00:14:45,938
Woman: It's a beautiful room,
with fabulous views of the city.

246
00:14:45,938 --> 00:14:48,338
Woman: It's a beautiful room,
with fabulous views of the city.

247
00:14:48,373 --> 00:14:49,965
Pardon me, ladies.

248
00:15:03,422 --> 00:15:04,889
Man:
Thanks very much.

249
00:15:04,923 --> 00:15:06,413
Welcome to
the Dolphin, sir.

250
00:15:06,458 --> 00:15:08,426
- Are you checking in?
- Mike Enslin.

251
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:09,688
One night.

252
00:15:09,728 --> 00:15:12,219
And how are we
spelling that today?

253
00:15:12,264 --> 00:15:14,528
- N-S-L-l-N?
- N-S-L-l-N.

254
00:15:14,566 --> 00:15:15,760
Yeah.

255
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:23,570
Uh, would you excuse me
for a moment, sir?

256
00:15:23,609 --> 00:15:25,338
Sure.

257
00:15:28,447 --> 00:15:31,473
Mr. Dempsey, Mike Enslin's
just checked in.

258
00:15:31,517 --> 00:15:33,985
- Where is he?
- He's over at my desk.

259
00:15:34,019 --> 00:15:36,419
That's fine, Marie.
I'll take care of it.

260
00:15:36,455 --> 00:15:37,820
Okay.

261
00:15:43,228 --> 00:15:45,219
It'll just be a minute,
Mr. Enslin.

262
00:15:45,264 --> 00:15:46,959
(baby crying)

263
00:15:50,302 --> 00:15:52,634
Good evening, sir.
Can I help you with your bag?

264
00:15:52,671 --> 00:15:55,139
- No.
- Very well.

265
00:15:57,042 --> 00:15:59,704
Mr. Enslin,
I'm Gerald Olin,

266
00:15:59,745 --> 00:16:01,508
manager of
the Dolphin.

267
00:16:01,547 --> 00:16:04,482
If there's anything that I can do
for you while you're here...

268
00:16:04,516 --> 00:16:06,780
dinner reservations,
theater tickets,

269
00:16:06,818 --> 00:16:08,547
maybe a Knicks game?
Anything...

270
00:16:08,587 --> 00:16:10,578
just tell me.
I am at your service.

271
00:16:10,622 --> 00:16:13,750
Well, if I can just get the key to 1408,
I can get out of your hair.

272
00:16:13,792 --> 00:16:17,523
Oh, we were thinking
of upgrading you to a penthouse suite.

273
00:16:17,563 --> 00:16:20,088
1408, please.

274
00:16:20,132 --> 00:16:22,259
Insistent,
aren't we?

275
00:16:22,301 --> 00:16:24,166
Could you please
humor me

276
00:16:24,203 --> 00:16:28,196
by coming to my office for a more
private conversation?

277
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,640
- Sure.
- Excellent.

278
00:16:34,746 --> 00:16:37,180
Come in.
Make yourself comfortable.

279
00:16:38,917 --> 00:16:40,748
1408 a smoking room?

280
00:16:40,786 --> 00:16:43,084
As a matter of fact,
it is. Yes.

281
00:16:43,121 --> 00:16:46,522
Good, one less worry in
the watches of the night.

282
00:16:46,558 --> 00:16:48,492
Care for a cigar?

283
00:16:48,527 --> 00:16:50,654
No thank you,
I don't smoke.

284
00:16:50,696 --> 00:16:52,459
Oh this, yeah.
That's...

285
00:16:52,497 --> 00:16:54,931
in case nuclear war
breaks out.

286
00:16:54,967 --> 00:16:56,127
I gave it up
a long time ago.

287
00:16:56,168 --> 00:16:58,033
It's part habit,
part superstition.

288
00:16:58,070 --> 00:16:59,435
It's, you know,
a writer thing.

289
00:16:59,471 --> 00:17:01,234
You do drink,
don't you?

290
00:17:01,273 --> 00:17:03,036
Of course, I just said
I was a writer.

291
00:17:03,075 --> 00:17:06,374
Le Cinquante Sept
Deces, 1939.

292
00:17:06,411 --> 00:17:08,208
Exquisite.

293
00:17:08,247 --> 00:17:10,442
About $800 a bottle,
when you can find it.

294
00:17:10,482 --> 00:17:13,349
I appreciate the bribe,
but I intend on staying in that room.

295
00:17:14,653 --> 00:17:16,712
- How long?
- How long?

296
00:17:17,723 --> 00:17:19,350
My usual is
overnight.

297
00:17:19,391 --> 00:17:21,359
I see.

298
00:17:21,393 --> 00:17:24,226
No one's ever lasted
more than an hour.

299
00:17:24,263 --> 00:17:26,197
(laughs)
Jesus, man.

300
00:17:26,231 --> 00:17:28,290
You ought to shave your eyebrows
and paint your hair gold

301
00:17:28,333 --> 00:17:30,824
if you're gonna try
to sell that spookhouse bullshit.

302
00:17:30,869 --> 00:17:32,302
Otherwise, you'll
scare the children.

303
00:17:32,337 --> 00:17:34,396
Why are you mocking me
when I am genuinely,

304
00:17:34,439 --> 00:17:36,634
to the best of my ability,
trying to help you?

305
00:17:36,675 --> 00:17:38,404
No, you're playing
a little game.

306
00:17:38,443 --> 00:17:40,673
You're selling
the mystique.

307
00:17:40,712 --> 00:17:43,112
But eventually,
we both know

308
00:17:43,148 --> 00:17:45,673
you're gonna give me the key
and I'm gonna go up to the room

309
00:17:45,717 --> 00:17:48,413
and I'm gonna write my story
and your bookings are gonna go up 50%.

310
00:17:48,453 --> 00:17:51,786
Do you mind if my little friend records
our conversation?

311
00:17:54,593 --> 00:17:55,992
I'll take that as a yes.

312
00:17:56,028 --> 00:17:59,429
Sir, you quite
misunderstand the situation.

313
00:17:59,464 --> 00:18:02,763
Now, I know the Dolphin
doesn't have the cachet of the Plaza

314
00:18:02,801 --> 00:18:04,496
or the Carlyle,

315
00:18:04,536 --> 00:18:07,664
but we operate
at 90% capacity.

316
00:18:07,706 --> 00:18:08,866
Always.

317
00:18:08,907 --> 00:18:11,569
And my concern here
is not for the hotel.

318
00:18:11,610 --> 00:18:14,135
My concern here
is not for you.

319
00:18:14,179 --> 00:18:16,443
Frankly, selfishly,

320
00:18:16,481 --> 00:18:19,450
I don't want you
to check into 1408

321
00:18:19,484 --> 00:18:21,816
because I don't want
to clean up the mess.

322
00:18:21,853 --> 00:18:25,254
Now hotels are all
about presentation

323
00:18:25,290 --> 00:18:27,850
and fertile
creature comforts.

324
00:18:27,893 --> 00:18:30,862
My training is
as a manager,

325
00:18:30,896 --> 00:18:32,864
not a coroner.

326
00:18:32,898 --> 00:18:36,197
Under my watch there have
been four deaths... four.

327
00:18:36,234 --> 00:18:38,794
After the last one,
I forbade any guest

328
00:18:38,837 --> 00:18:41,101
from checking
into 1408 ever again.

329
00:18:41,139 --> 00:18:44,472
The last one was David Hide,
orthodontist, manic-depressive.

330
00:18:44,509 --> 00:18:46,636
Slit his wrist,
did a little self-surgery,

331
00:18:46,678 --> 00:18:48,145
turned himself into
a eunuch, right?

332
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:50,671
Yes. So you've
done your homework.

333
00:18:50,716 --> 00:18:51,842
I'm a professional too.

334
00:18:51,883 --> 00:18:54,784
Well, grievously, in its
95-year existence,

335
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:57,220
the hotel has seen
seven jumpers,

336
00:18:57,255 --> 00:18:59,280
four overdoses,
five hangings,

337
00:18:59,324 --> 00:19:00,552
- three mutilations...
- Three mutilations...

338
00:19:00,592 --> 00:19:02,287
two stranglings.
General manager Gerald Olin

339
00:19:02,327 --> 00:19:04,454
is well-versed in
the hotel's tragic history,

340
00:19:04,496 --> 00:19:07,294
dryly reciting the docket
of carnage like a bookkeeper

341
00:19:07,332 --> 00:19:09,061
discussing his ledger.

342
00:19:09,101 --> 00:19:11,160
Well, you think
you're clever, don't you?

343
00:19:11,203 --> 00:19:12,534
I know the game.

344
00:19:12,571 --> 00:19:13,970
Well, during
your investigation,

345
00:19:14,005 --> 00:19:16,496
did you discover
the 22 natural deaths

346
00:19:16,541 --> 00:19:18,532
that have occurred
in 1408?

347
00:19:20,312 --> 00:19:21,643
Natural deaths?

348
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:24,012
Ah, didn't find out
about them

349
00:19:24,049 --> 00:19:27,576
because the newspapers don't
print anything about them.

350
00:19:27,619 --> 00:19:30,952
Hmm. All told,
there have been 56 deaths

351
00:19:30,989 --> 00:19:32,422
in 1408.

352
00:19:32,457 --> 00:19:35,688
56?
You're shitting me.

353
00:19:35,727 --> 00:19:37,524
You don't know anything.

354
00:19:37,562 --> 00:19:40,588
The causes of death
in 1408 range

355
00:19:40,632 --> 00:19:43,066
from heart attack,
stroke, drowning...

356
00:19:43,101 --> 00:19:45,797
- Drowning?
- Yes, one Mr. Grady Miller

357
00:19:45,837 --> 00:19:47,964
drowned
in his chicken soup.

358
00:19:48,006 --> 00:19:50,372
That's hard to do.
How... how did he do that?

359
00:19:50,409 --> 00:19:52,001
How indeed?

360
00:19:52,043 --> 00:19:55,035
Interesting.
It's all in here.

361
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:58,447
I will let you have this
and give you access to my office.

362
00:19:58,483 --> 00:20:00,815
You can take notes,
put it all in your book.

363
00:20:00,852 --> 00:20:03,047
My only condition

364
00:20:03,088 --> 00:20:06,785
is that you do not
stay in that room.

365
00:20:06,825 --> 00:20:09,521
You'll let me look
at all that stuff?

366
00:20:09,561 --> 00:20:11,552
Hmm.

367
00:20:19,271 --> 00:20:22,240
I never did
get that drink.

368
00:20:27,012 --> 00:20:28,411
(corks pops)

369
00:20:40,859 --> 00:20:44,192
- Oh, that is good.
- Here, keep it.

370
00:20:44,229 --> 00:20:46,254
Compliments
of the house.

371
00:20:57,876 --> 00:20:59,571
- I'm still staying.
- Damn it to hell!

372
00:20:59,611 --> 00:21:01,511
I'm sorry.

373
00:21:01,546 --> 00:21:04,606
All right here.
Here, read the godforsaken thing.

374
00:21:04,649 --> 00:21:06,742
I guarantee you,
once you've read it

375
00:21:06,785 --> 00:21:09,151
you won't want to stay
in 1408.

376
00:21:11,122 --> 00:21:13,386
The first victim:
Mr. Kevin O'Malley,

377
00:21:13,425 --> 00:21:15,222
sewing machine salesman.

378
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:17,125
Checked into the hotel
the first week it opened...

379
00:21:17,162 --> 00:21:20,097
- October, 1912.
- Cut his own throat, right?

380
00:21:20,131 --> 00:21:21,689
Oh, that's not
the horrific part.

381
00:21:21,733 --> 00:21:23,758
Afterwards, in a fit
of insanity,

382
00:21:23,802 --> 00:21:26,236
he tried to stitch
himself back together

383
00:21:26,271 --> 00:21:28,705
using an old sewing needle
before he bled to death.

384
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:30,435
Easy, man.

385
00:21:30,475 --> 00:21:33,467
Look, Mr. Enslin,
you don't have to stay in 1408.

386
00:21:33,512 --> 00:21:35,537
You can take
photographs of 1404.

387
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:39,107
It has the exact same layout and no one
will ever know the difference.

388
00:21:39,150 --> 00:21:41,812
- My readers expect the truth.
- Your readers?

389
00:21:41,853 --> 00:21:44,651
Your readers expect
grotesqueries

390
00:21:44,689 --> 00:21:46,850
and cheap thrills.

391
00:21:46,892 --> 00:21:49,622
"The headless ghost
of Mr. Eugene Rilsby

392
00:21:49,661 --> 00:21:51,424
still walks
his abandoned farmhouse."

393
00:21:51,463 --> 00:21:54,899
"The Barking Phantom
of Mount Hope Cemetery."

394
00:21:54,933 --> 00:21:56,662
A direct quote...
how'd you know that?

395
00:21:56,701 --> 00:21:58,464
Your books aren't
hard to find.

396
00:21:58,503 --> 00:22:00,368
They're on the bargain
shelves

397
00:22:00,405 --> 00:22:03,135
of any paperback
novel store;

398
00:22:03,174 --> 00:22:06,701
full of cynicism,
written by a talented, intelligent man

399
00:22:06,745 --> 00:22:09,407
who doesn't believe
in anything or anyone but himself.

400
00:22:09,447 --> 00:22:12,348
Guilty as charged.

401
00:22:12,384 --> 00:22:15,182
Hey listen, this meeting's over.
Why don't you give me the room?

402
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:17,711
Oh please, don't act
like a hurt schoolgirl.

403
00:22:17,756 --> 00:22:20,816
- In fact, you surprised me.
- Oh.

404
00:22:20,859 --> 00:22:23,692
You are not
the hack-n-slash I expected.

405
00:22:23,728 --> 00:22:26,322
I rather liked the first one,
the hardcover.

406
00:22:26,364 --> 00:22:30,061
What was it called?
"The Last Walk..."

407
00:22:30,101 --> 00:22:31,398
"Long Road Home."

408
00:22:31,436 --> 00:22:34,405
"The Long Road Home,"
yes.

409
00:22:34,439 --> 00:22:36,907
I rather thought
the father was a bastard.

410
00:22:36,942 --> 00:22:38,842
Yeah, he was.

411
00:22:38,877 --> 00:22:40,902
Um...

412
00:22:40,946 --> 00:22:42,413
Iook man, just
give me the key.

413
00:22:42,447 --> 00:22:45,541
- Mr. Enslin...
- Just give me the key!

414
00:22:45,584 --> 00:22:48,610
Listen, I stayed
at the Bigsby house.

415
00:22:48,653 --> 00:22:51,588
I brushed my goddamn teeth
right next to the tub

416
00:22:51,623 --> 00:22:53,921
where Sir David Smith
drowned his whole family.

417
00:22:53,959 --> 00:22:56,928
And I stopped being afraid
of vampires when I was 12.

418
00:22:56,962 --> 00:23:00,523
Do you know why I can stay
in your spooky old room, Mr. Olin?

419
00:23:00,565 --> 00:23:03,363
Because I know that
ghoulies and ghosties

420
00:23:03,401 --> 00:23:05,699
and long-legged beasties
don't exist.

421
00:23:06,838 --> 00:23:08,328
Even if they did,

422
00:23:08,373 --> 00:23:10,967
there's no God to protect
us from them, is there?

423
00:23:12,711 --> 00:23:14,702
So I can't talk you
out of this?

424
00:23:14,746 --> 00:23:17,306
I think we've reached
an understanding.

425
00:23:17,349 --> 00:23:19,783
Very well.

426
00:23:19,818 --> 00:23:22,378
Come with me.

427
00:23:27,359 --> 00:23:29,452
(jangles)

428
00:23:32,530 --> 00:23:34,191
(elevator dings)

429
00:23:34,232 --> 00:23:36,666
Most hotels have
switched to magnetics.

430
00:23:36,701 --> 00:23:40,137
An actual key.
That's a nice touch... it's antiquey.

431
00:23:40,171 --> 00:23:43,732
We have magnetic cards also, but
electronics don't seem to work in 1408.

432
00:23:43,775 --> 00:23:45,640
Hope you don't have
a pacemaker.

433
00:23:45,677 --> 00:23:48,646
General manager claims that the phantom
in room interferes...

434
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:50,773
I have never used
the word "phantom."

435
00:23:50,815 --> 00:23:53,283
Oh, I'm sorry.
Spirit? Specter?

436
00:23:53,318 --> 00:23:54,842
No, you misunderstand.

437
00:23:54,886 --> 00:23:57,150
Whatever's in 1408
is nothing like that.

438
00:23:57,188 --> 00:23:59,986
Then what is it?

439
00:24:00,025 --> 00:24:02,459
It's an evil
fucking room.

440
00:24:04,396 --> 00:24:06,523
Please.

441
00:24:10,268 --> 00:24:13,863
Mr. Odin.
(speaks French)

442
00:24:13,905 --> 00:24:16,703
Oh, oui.
Tres bien.

443
00:24:18,510 --> 00:24:20,102
(classical
music playing)

444
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:24,705
Why don't the owners
just close the room?

445
00:24:26,384 --> 00:24:28,852
The Yasuko Corporation
prefers to pretend there's no problem.

446
00:24:28,887 --> 00:24:31,879
Just as they pretend
there's no 13th floor.

447
00:24:33,525 --> 00:24:35,493
The room,
it's got to be filthy.

448
00:24:35,527 --> 00:24:37,722
I mean, the sheets haven't been changed
in what? 11 years?

449
00:24:37,762 --> 00:24:40,697
No no no,
we're very professional.

450
00:24:40,732 --> 00:24:44,168
1408 gets a light
turn once a month.

451
00:24:44,202 --> 00:24:46,432
I supervise, the maids
work in pairs.

452
00:24:46,471 --> 00:24:49,235
We treat the room
as if it's a chamber

453
00:24:49,274 --> 00:24:50,798
filled with poison gas.

454
00:24:50,842 --> 00:24:54,539
We only stay 10 minutes
and I insist the door remain open.

455
00:24:54,579 --> 00:24:56,945
But still...

456
00:24:59,250 --> 00:25:01,878
A few years ago, a young
maid from El Salvador

457
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,478
found herself locked
in the bathroom.

458
00:25:03,521 --> 00:25:04,749
She was only there
for a few moments,

459
00:25:04,789 --> 00:25:06,780
but when we pulled
her out, she was...

460
00:25:06,825 --> 00:25:09,555
- She was dead.
- No, blind.

461
00:25:09,594 --> 00:25:11,789
She had taken a pair
of scissors

462
00:25:11,830 --> 00:25:13,798
and gouged
her eyes out.

463
00:25:13,832 --> 00:25:16,198
- She was laughing hysterically.
- (bell rings)

464
00:25:16,234 --> 00:25:18,532
- Ouch.
- Your floor.

465
00:25:19,704 --> 00:25:21,331
Well, this is where
we part company.

466
00:25:21,372 --> 00:25:24,603
This is as close
as I get to 1408

467
00:25:24,642 --> 00:25:26,701
unless it's that time
of the month.

468
00:25:28,613 --> 00:25:31,343
- See you tomorrow.
- Mr. Enslin?

469
00:25:31,382 --> 00:25:33,350
Please...

470
00:25:33,384 --> 00:25:35,352
don't do this.

471
00:25:38,590 --> 00:25:40,558
I'll call you about
those Knicks tickets.

472
00:25:40,592 --> 00:25:43,117
(bell rings)

473
00:25:55,507 --> 00:25:57,805
(man speaking loudly)

474
00:26:13,091 --> 00:26:15,252
(TV playing)

475
00:26:17,762 --> 00:26:19,389
(wheel squeaking)

476
00:26:29,808 --> 00:26:31,901
(woman laughing)
Stop it!

477
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,618
(elevator dings)

478
00:26:44,656 --> 00:26:47,489
(classical music
playing)

479
00:27:04,008 --> 00:27:05,976
(flies buzzing)

480
00:27:06,010 --> 00:27:08,171
(baby crying)

481
00:27:10,882 --> 00:27:13,715
Okay. It's okay, sweetie.
We're home now.

482
00:27:13,751 --> 00:27:14,843
Here we go.

483
00:27:21,226 --> 00:27:23,091
(knocks)

484
00:28:19,651 --> 00:28:21,778
This is it?

485
00:28:22,787 --> 00:28:25,449
You got to be kidding me.

486
00:28:41,439 --> 00:28:44,738
Round one goes to the hideous Mr. Olin
for effective aggressiveness.

487
00:28:44,776 --> 00:28:48,109
I have to admit,
he had me going for a moment.

488
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:52,213
But where is
the bone-chilling terror?

489
00:28:52,250 --> 00:28:55,014
Show me the rivers
of blood.

490
00:29:00,992 --> 00:29:03,460
It's just a room.

491
00:29:03,494 --> 00:29:05,621
(Muzak playing)

492
00:29:14,872 --> 00:29:16,533
(TV turns off)

493
00:29:48,373 --> 00:29:51,638
$8 for beer nuts.

494
00:29:51,676 --> 00:29:54,201
This room is evil.

495
00:29:54,245 --> 00:29:57,305
Mike's voice: Olin said hotels are about
fertile creature comforts.

496
00:29:57,348 --> 00:29:59,646
It's a good line,
but I wonder

497
00:29:59,684 --> 00:30:02,482
whether they're really
about reassuring platitudes,

498
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:05,011
a prosaic sense
of the familiar.

499
00:30:05,056 --> 00:30:08,423
"Yes, I've
been here before.

500
00:30:08,459 --> 00:30:11,587
It's safe."

501
00:30:11,629 --> 00:30:14,120
There's a sofa,

502
00:30:14,165 --> 00:30:17,657
a writing desk,
a faux antique armoire,

503
00:30:17,702 --> 00:30:19,829
floral wallpaper.

504
00:30:19,871 --> 00:30:22,237
Carpet's unremarkable,
except for a stain

505
00:30:22,273 --> 00:30:25,470
beneath a thrift-store painting
of a schooner lost at sea.

506
00:30:25,510 --> 00:30:28,809
The work is done in the
predictably dull fashion

507
00:30:28,846 --> 00:30:30,711
of Currier & lves.

508
00:30:30,748 --> 00:30:33,239
The second painting
is of an old woman

509
00:30:33,284 --> 00:30:35,514
reading bedtime stories...
a Whistler knockoff...

510
00:30:35,553 --> 00:30:37,316
to a group
of deranged children

511
00:30:37,355 --> 00:30:41,052
as another Madonna and child
watch from the background.

512
00:30:41,092 --> 00:30:44,755
It does have
the vague air of menace.

513
00:30:44,796 --> 00:30:48,857
The third and final
painfully dull painting

514
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:50,891
is the ever-popular
"The Hunt."

515
00:30:50,935 --> 00:30:53,563
Horses, hounds
and constipated British lords.

516
00:30:53,604 --> 00:30:56,664
Some smartass spoke about
the banality of evil.

517
00:30:56,707 --> 00:30:58,766
If that's true,

518
00:30:58,810 --> 00:31:01,574
then we're in
the seventh circle of Hell.

519
00:31:04,582 --> 00:31:07,016
It does have
its charms.

520
00:31:12,390 --> 00:31:14,358
(traffic noise)

521
00:31:14,392 --> 00:31:17,555
The panorama is typically cramped
New York City view of nothing:

522
00:31:17,595 --> 00:31:20,291
Dull, grey
buildings all around;

523
00:31:20,331 --> 00:31:23,596
Honking traffic below.
The view of a...

524
00:31:23,634 --> 00:31:27,001
- Radio: # We've only just begun... #
- Ow!

525
00:31:27,038 --> 00:31:31,168
- # To live... #
- Holy shit.

526
00:31:31,209 --> 00:31:35,509
# White lace
and promises #

527
00:31:36,981 --> 00:31:41,884
# A kiss for luck
and we're on our way #

528
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:45,411
# We've only begun #

529
00:31:45,456 --> 00:31:48,755
# Before the rising sun... #

530
00:31:48,793 --> 00:31:51,762
Bravo, Olin.
That is very unsettling.

531
00:31:53,364 --> 00:31:58,666
# So many roads
to choose #

532
00:31:58,703 --> 00:32:04,335
# We start off walking
and learn to run #

533
00:32:04,375 --> 00:32:06,309
# And yet
we've just begun... #

534
00:32:06,344 --> 00:32:08,608
That means
someone's in the room.

535
00:32:11,849 --> 00:32:15,114
Hello?

536
00:32:15,153 --> 00:32:16,313
Hello!

537
00:32:19,891 --> 00:32:21,017
Whoa.

538
00:32:25,663 --> 00:32:27,096
That is bizarre.

539
00:32:29,267 --> 00:32:31,064
(turns off radio)

540
00:32:31,102 --> 00:32:33,536
Finally I got
something to write about.

541
00:32:33,571 --> 00:32:36,039
A ghost that offers
turn-down service.

542
00:32:36,073 --> 00:32:37,768
(chuckles)

543
00:32:39,477 --> 00:32:41,240
All right.

544
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:44,112
All right, let's Encyclopedia
Brown this bitch.

545
00:32:44,148 --> 00:32:46,116
Started off the window,

546
00:32:46,150 --> 00:32:48,175
hear the music,
nab my head.

547
00:32:48,219 --> 00:32:50,687
I turn around, go to
the bed for the chocolate.

548
00:32:50,721 --> 00:32:52,689
Then I go into the closet
which would have...

549
00:32:52,723 --> 00:32:54,714
my back was turned.
It would have let

550
00:32:54,759 --> 00:32:58,126
Houdini have time to come in
here do the paper trick...

551
00:32:58,162 --> 00:33:00,790
and he's in the living room.

552
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:17,341
Out!

553
00:33:23,254 --> 00:33:24,721
Huh.

554
00:33:29,627 --> 00:33:31,322
(air blowing)

555
00:33:31,362 --> 00:33:33,091
Hello?

556
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:45,470
You're gonna have to
try harder, asshole!

557
00:33:45,509 --> 00:33:47,534
Nice and warm
for you up there?

558
00:33:47,578 --> 00:33:49,239
It's hot down here,
bubba.

559
00:33:58,589 --> 00:34:00,250
Come on.

560
00:34:12,970 --> 00:34:15,268
(ringing)

561
00:34:15,306 --> 00:34:17,672
- Woman: Front desk.
- Hello, this is Mike Enslin.

562
00:34:17,708 --> 00:34:20,006
- Guess which room.
- Good evening, sir.

563
00:34:20,044 --> 00:34:22,035
- Good evening.
- Are you ready to check out?

564
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:23,944
Check out?
No no no no no.

565
00:34:23,981 --> 00:34:25,778
Check out, check out, no.
Why would I check out?

566
00:34:25,816 --> 00:34:29,252
Especially with this wonderful
maid service. It's so discreet.

567
00:34:29,287 --> 00:34:31,881
No no no, I need you to send somebody
to fix my thermostat.

568
00:34:31,922 --> 00:34:34,186
- Room's on fire.
- Of course, sir.

569
00:34:34,225 --> 00:34:35,783
We'll send an engineer
right up.

570
00:34:35,826 --> 00:34:38,294
- You will?
- Absolutely.

571
00:34:38,329 --> 00:34:40,092
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

572
00:34:47,972 --> 00:34:50,133
(baby crying)

573
00:34:51,709 --> 00:34:53,574
(woman humming)

574
00:35:22,206 --> 00:35:24,640
How many thin walls

575
00:35:24,675 --> 00:35:26,870
have we put up
with together,

576
00:35:26,911 --> 00:35:28,902
old boy?

577
00:35:29,914 --> 00:35:32,747
How many sarcophagal chambers?

578
00:35:36,487 --> 00:35:38,717
Hotel rooms are a naturally
creepy place...

579
00:35:39,724 --> 00:35:41,282
don't you think?

580
00:35:41,325 --> 00:35:43,657
I mean, how many people
have slept in that bed before you?

581
00:35:43,694 --> 00:35:45,286
How many of them
were sick?

582
00:35:45,329 --> 00:35:47,559
How many of them
lost their minds?

583
00:35:49,767 --> 00:35:52,964
How many of them... died?

584
00:35:54,939 --> 00:35:57,203
We came here
to get the story,

585
00:35:57,241 --> 00:36:00,108
and we don't rattle,
do we?

586
00:36:04,548 --> 00:36:05,810
(shutter clicking)

587
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:11,411
(sloshes)

588
00:36:39,950 --> 00:36:42,544
(creaking)

589
00:37:25,830 --> 00:37:28,731
It's not that what
I'm seeing is not real.

590
00:37:28,766 --> 00:37:31,030
It just ain't as real
as it seems.

591
00:37:31,068 --> 00:37:34,367
(wind howling,
waves crashing)

592
00:37:35,439 --> 00:37:37,270
- (bangs on door)
- Hello?

593
00:37:37,308 --> 00:37:39,868
Man: You got a problem
with the temperature?

594
00:37:45,816 --> 00:37:47,113
Yeah.

595
00:37:52,156 --> 00:37:53,680
Come on.

596
00:37:57,328 --> 00:37:59,057
Is it too hot
or too cold?

597
00:37:59,096 --> 00:38:00,996
What does it look like?

598
00:38:01,031 --> 00:38:03,124
Come on in.

599
00:38:03,167 --> 00:38:05,032
The box is
right over here.

600
00:38:05,069 --> 00:38:06,593
It's stuck around 80.

601
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:11,799
I said the box
is right here.

602
00:38:11,842 --> 00:38:14,436
I know where the hell it is,
but I ain't going in this room.

603
00:38:15,813 --> 00:38:18,304
You just have to walk
six or seven feet.

604
00:38:18,349 --> 00:38:20,840
I said I ain't going in.
You know what happened in here?

605
00:38:20,885 --> 00:38:22,113
Yes, I'm well aware
of that.

606
00:38:22,152 --> 00:38:24,017
Look, I'll talk
you through it.

607
00:38:24,054 --> 00:38:26,181
Any jackass can fix
that thing.

608
00:38:26,223 --> 00:38:28,088
Just remove the panel.

609
00:38:32,263 --> 00:38:34,891
Okay, now above that coil

610
00:38:34,932 --> 00:38:36,695
is a little tube
filled with mercury.

611
00:38:36,734 --> 00:38:39,168
That's supposed to activate
the contact switch.

612
00:38:39,203 --> 00:38:42,331
But this hotel's so goddamn old,
half the shit in here don't work.

613
00:38:42,373 --> 00:38:44,034
Just give the tube
a little tap.

614
00:38:44,074 --> 00:38:45,666
Just tap the damn thing!

615
00:38:47,945 --> 00:38:49,708
Yeah, there it is.

616
00:38:49,747 --> 00:38:52,181
Oh, sir,
you're a genius.

617
00:38:52,216 --> 00:38:54,207
A gentleman and a scholar.

618
00:38:54,251 --> 00:38:55,741
Thank you.
Let me give you...

619
00:38:56,820 --> 00:38:58,219
a tip.

620
00:39:01,025 --> 00:39:02,583
Sir?

621
00:39:31,121 --> 00:39:34,955
Radio:
# And yet we've just begun #

622
00:39:36,226 --> 00:39:38,694
(gags)

623
00:39:38,729 --> 00:39:41,061
# Sharing horizons... #

624
00:39:41,098 --> 00:39:43,032
Son of a...

625
00:39:49,506 --> 00:39:52,498
(beeping)

626
00:40:04,488 --> 00:40:06,683
Nobody lasts
more than an hour.

627
00:40:10,394 --> 00:40:12,362
Very effective.

628
00:40:13,831 --> 00:40:16,493
(high-pitched humming)

629
00:40:16,533 --> 00:40:19,832
(heart beating)

630
00:40:33,651 --> 00:40:35,676
(silent)

631
00:40:50,067 --> 00:40:51,534
(screams)

632
00:40:51,568 --> 00:40:53,468
Oh fuck!
Jesus!

633
00:40:54,805 --> 00:40:56,397
Oh, God.

634
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:59,034
Ow!
Son of a...

635
00:41:15,893 --> 00:41:18,862
Ow! Fuck!
Agh!

636
00:41:22,332 --> 00:41:24,527
Ow!
God!

637
00:41:38,248 --> 00:41:39,943
(sink gurgling)

638
00:41:46,290 --> 00:41:48,451
(groans)

639
00:41:53,330 --> 00:41:58,495
# We've only just begun #

640
00:41:58,535 --> 00:42:00,332
# To li... #

641
00:42:05,876 --> 00:42:07,400
(phone ringing)

642
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:12,810
- Hello?
- (dial tone)

643
00:42:12,850 --> 00:42:15,250
(ringing continues)

644
00:42:16,887 --> 00:42:18,752
- Hello?
- Woman: Sir, I'm afraid there was

645
00:42:18,789 --> 00:42:20,654
a miscommunication
in the kitchen.

646
00:42:20,691 --> 00:42:22,852
There's going to be a 10-minute delay
with your sandwich.

647
00:42:22,893 --> 00:42:24,019
Sandwich?
What sandwich?

648
00:42:24,061 --> 00:42:25,926
I didn't order any sandwich.
What are you talking about?

649
00:42:25,963 --> 00:42:27,453
I'm sorry.
You're welcome to substitute

650
00:42:27,498 --> 00:42:29,466
a side dish for
your French fries.

651
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:31,525
We have cottage cheese,
macaroni salad,

652
00:42:31,568 --> 00:42:33,502
- coleslaw...
- Listen to me. You win.

653
00:42:33,537 --> 00:42:35,471
I'm checking out.
I'm hurt.

654
00:42:35,506 --> 00:42:37,736
Do you understand?
My goddamn hand is hurt.

655
00:42:37,775 --> 00:42:40,539
I understand. If you leave your dry
cleaning out by 10:00 AM,

656
00:42:40,577 --> 00:42:42,704
we'll have it pressed
and returned by 5:00...

657
00:42:42,746 --> 00:42:45,044
Shit, bitch! Call me a cab
to the nearest hospital!

658
00:42:45,082 --> 00:42:48,017
I'm hurt! Do you comprehend
what I'm telling you?

659
00:42:48,051 --> 00:42:51,214
Sir, I will not tolerate you speaking
to me in that tone of voice.

660
00:42:51,255 --> 00:42:54,190
You're an idiot!
I'm gonna sue your ass!

661
00:42:54,224 --> 00:42:56,658
I'm gonna take legal action!
What's wrong with you?

662
00:42:56,693 --> 00:42:59,924
If you wish, I can connect you
with our manager Mr. Olin.

663
00:42:59,963 --> 00:43:02,090
Good! Good good good
good good! Put him on.

664
00:43:02,132 --> 00:43:04,327
Put him on. I'm gonna blitz
the son of a bitch.

665
00:43:04,368 --> 00:43:06,233
Olin... good!
Put him on now!

666
00:43:06,270 --> 00:43:08,238
(Muzak playing)

667
00:43:08,272 --> 00:43:10,502
Man's voice: When staying at
the Dolphin, be certain to enjoy

668
00:43:10,541 --> 00:43:13,476
New York's finest dining at the fabled
Sea Bream restaurant

669
00:43:13,510 --> 00:43:15,671
on our mezzanine level.
Muscles tense?

670
00:43:15,712 --> 00:43:18,180
Then make an appointment
to visit our deluxe spa

671
00:43:18,215 --> 00:43:20,012
on the Coral level.
With full massage,

672
00:43:20,050 --> 00:43:21,642
facial and aromatherapy
facilities,

673
00:43:21,685 --> 00:43:23,846
- it will leave you feeling relaxed...
- Hello?

674
00:43:23,887 --> 00:43:26,879
And revitalized.
Your call is important to us...

675
00:43:26,924 --> 00:43:28,653
- (dial tone)
- You bitch.

676
00:43:29,660 --> 00:43:31,321
You win.
You win.

677
00:43:31,361 --> 00:43:33,556
All right.
Okay!

678
00:43:35,599 --> 00:43:37,829
Come on.
Come on!

679
00:43:56,086 --> 00:43:57,713
Come on.
Come on.

680
00:43:58,722 --> 00:44:00,212
(lock clicks)

681
00:44:07,631 --> 00:44:09,189
Hey!

682
00:44:09,233 --> 00:44:11,030
Help!
Help!

683
00:44:11,068 --> 00:44:13,195
(grunting)

684
00:44:23,814 --> 00:44:26,578
Help! Help!

685
00:44:28,819 --> 00:44:30,548
Can anybody hear me?

686
00:44:30,587 --> 00:44:33,055
- Help!
- (siren blaring)

687
00:44:34,224 --> 00:44:37,785
You! Sir!
Sir! Help!

688
00:44:39,696 --> 00:44:41,163
Yeah!
Yeah, you! Help!

689
00:44:41,198 --> 00:44:44,224
Help! Help!
You, sir!

690
00:44:45,469 --> 00:44:48,097
Help!
Can you see me?

691
00:44:48,138 --> 00:44:51,369
Yeah!
The Dolphin Hotel!

692
00:44:51,408 --> 00:44:53,308
Call the police!

693
00:44:55,379 --> 00:44:57,040
Help!

694
00:45:00,083 --> 00:45:01,675
Help!

695
00:45:40,691 --> 00:45:42,488
Hey!
Look out!

696
00:45:46,797 --> 00:45:48,788
(whimpering)

697
00:45:56,773 --> 00:45:58,502
(panting)

698
00:46:11,421 --> 00:46:13,821
Hey!

699
00:46:30,807 --> 00:46:33,002
I'm losing my mind.

700
00:46:33,043 --> 00:46:34,670
Girl's voice:
I can see you, Dad.

701
00:46:34,711 --> 00:46:37,407
(gasps)

702
00:46:39,983 --> 00:46:42,850
Daddy?
Daddy, where are you?

703
00:46:44,888 --> 00:46:47,516
(giggles)
I'm gonna get you.

704
00:46:48,558 --> 00:46:50,048
Ready or not,

705
00:46:50,093 --> 00:46:52,027
here I come.

706
00:46:53,397 --> 00:46:55,297
(panting)

707
00:46:58,869 --> 00:47:01,064
Here you are.

708
00:47:01,104 --> 00:47:03,937
I see you, Daddy.
(giggling)

709
00:47:06,143 --> 00:47:08,236
Get ahold of yourself.

710
00:47:08,278 --> 00:47:10,542
(whispering) You're running to places
that aren't real.

711
00:47:10,580 --> 00:47:12,707
Get up. Get up.

712
00:47:15,385 --> 00:47:16,943
You're losing the plot.

713
00:47:21,591 --> 00:47:24,424
You're losing
the whole goddamn structure.

714
00:47:24,461 --> 00:47:27,828
Girl:
Daddy! Find me.

715
00:47:27,864 --> 00:47:30,833
Psychokinetic
fibrillations.

716
00:47:30,867 --> 00:47:34,098
A tired mind among classic haunted-house
powers of suggestion.

717
00:47:34,137 --> 00:47:36,037
Gaslit features,
faded rugs,

718
00:47:36,073 --> 00:47:38,200
like that motel
in Kansas.

719
00:47:38,241 --> 00:47:40,937
There's a reason for everything.
Just think.

720
00:47:43,713 --> 00:47:45,613
What's that?

721
00:47:46,650 --> 00:47:49,778
What is that?
Is that a spycam?

722
00:47:49,820 --> 00:47:53,347
Who is that?
Are you enjoying this?

723
00:47:53,390 --> 00:47:56,291
Is that the sadistic owner
of the hotel or is that Olin?

724
00:47:59,629 --> 00:48:01,529
Wait a minute.

725
00:48:02,999 --> 00:48:04,864
He gave me booze.

726
00:48:04,901 --> 00:48:07,563
He gave me booze.
Did he take a sip?

727
00:48:08,872 --> 00:48:10,737
I can't remember.
(sniffs)

728
00:48:13,009 --> 00:48:14,670
He dosed me!

729
00:48:14,711 --> 00:48:16,804
It was the booze
or the chocolates.

730
00:48:16,847 --> 00:48:18,815
Never take candy
from strangers.

731
00:48:18,849 --> 00:48:21,545
All right, all right.
I'm just hallucinating.

732
00:48:21,585 --> 00:48:23,815
I'm just hallucinating.

733
00:48:23,854 --> 00:48:25,287
I've just got to
ride this out.

734
00:48:25,322 --> 00:48:26,789
I've got to
ride this out

735
00:48:26,823 --> 00:48:29,314
for four or five hours
and I'm straight. Okay.

736
00:48:30,727 --> 00:48:32,092
You can do this.

737
00:48:32,129 --> 00:48:32,295
(overlapping voices)

738
00:48:32,295 --> 00:48:33,819
(overlapping voices)

739
00:48:33,864 --> 00:48:35,593
Woman:
Oh, man. I'm gonna get you.

740
00:48:35,632 --> 00:48:38,192
You are finished.
Come here. Come here!

741
00:48:38,235 --> 00:48:41,636
Dad! Sit down!

742
00:48:41,671 --> 00:48:43,263
Mike:
You want me to sit down?

743
00:48:43,306 --> 00:48:44,796
(giggling)

744
00:48:44,841 --> 00:48:46,240
Mike:
You want me to sit down?

745
00:48:46,276 --> 00:48:47,868
- Yes!
- Okay, hold on, hold on.

746
00:48:47,911 --> 00:48:49,435
Let me find a good...

747
00:48:49,479 --> 00:48:51,140
let me find a good
frame here.

748
00:48:53,116 --> 00:48:54,879
Ladies and gentlemen,

749
00:48:54,918 --> 00:48:57,978
welcome to the Most
Ugliest Person Competition.

750
00:48:59,156 --> 00:49:00,623
Fifth and fourth place

751
00:49:00,657 --> 00:49:03,091
goes to Boris and Doris
the goldfish.

752
00:49:03,126 --> 00:49:07,529
Ladies and gentlemen!
Let's get a closeup of those guys.

753
00:49:07,564 --> 00:49:09,429
Let's have a closeup
of Boris and Doris.

754
00:49:09,466 --> 00:49:12,264
Look at that.
Those are some ugly fish.

755
00:49:12,302 --> 00:49:14,668
They're so ugly
they're running from you.

756
00:49:14,704 --> 00:49:16,672
Third place
goes to Mike Enslin.

757
00:49:16,706 --> 00:49:18,435
- Surprise surprise.
- (both giggle)

758
00:49:18,475 --> 00:49:21,535
Right, how's this for ugly?
(roars)

759
00:49:25,815 --> 00:49:28,283
Second place
goes to Lily Enslin.

760
00:49:28,318 --> 00:49:31,446
- (roars)
- That was good.

761
00:49:31,488 --> 00:49:35,049
That's kind of like Beowulf
meets a redneck.

762
00:49:35,091 --> 00:49:39,289
- I like it.
- And first place goes to Katie Enslin.

763
00:49:41,565 --> 00:49:43,590
That is a terror.
That is...

764
00:49:43,633 --> 00:49:45,828
oh, God! Don't show
me that face!

765
00:49:45,869 --> 00:49:47,530
Oh, I can't look
at it again.

766
00:49:49,072 --> 00:49:51,165
Lily:
Whatever you do, don't turn around.

767
00:49:51,208 --> 00:49:52,971
Whatever you do,
don't show us that face.

768
00:50:08,258 --> 00:50:10,351
(static crackling)

769
00:50:28,645 --> 00:50:30,044
(woman crying)

770
00:50:45,595 --> 00:50:47,358
(woman screaming)

771
00:50:47,397 --> 00:50:50,230
(baby crying)

772
00:51:01,411 --> 00:51:03,402
(light tapping)

773
00:51:03,446 --> 00:51:05,880
Ma'am, can you hear me?

774
00:51:09,085 --> 00:51:10,985
Ma'am, I need your help.

775
00:51:12,155 --> 00:51:13,952
Please, ma'am,
can you hear me?

776
00:51:13,990 --> 00:51:16,220
(baby continues crying)

777
00:51:16,259 --> 00:51:19,057
- Kid, be quiet.
- (baby wailing)

778
00:51:19,095 --> 00:51:20,995
Please, ma'am.

779
00:51:21,031 --> 00:51:22,931
(crying intensifying,
echoing)

780
00:51:22,966 --> 00:51:25,662
Quiet!
(groans)

781
00:51:38,715 --> 00:51:38,848
(crying stops)

782
00:51:38,848 --> 00:51:40,440
(crying stops)

783
00:51:40,483 --> 00:51:42,917
(groaning)

784
00:51:48,525 --> 00:51:50,789
(siren blaring
in distance)

785
00:51:55,498 --> 00:51:57,466
(man crying)

786
00:52:18,788 --> 00:52:21,586
Man:
I... wish...

787
00:52:22,592 --> 00:52:25,356
I was dead.

788
00:52:28,631 --> 00:52:30,724
Where's my garden?

789
00:52:32,335 --> 00:52:35,065
I can't smell anything.

790
00:52:35,105 --> 00:52:38,097
I hate this place.

791
00:52:43,246 --> 00:52:45,237
How did I get here?

792
00:52:49,319 --> 00:52:51,184
Pop.

793
00:52:51,221 --> 00:52:52,882
Dad.

794
00:52:54,190 --> 00:52:55,919
It's Michael.

795
00:53:08,104 --> 00:53:10,538
As you are...

796
00:53:10,573 --> 00:53:13,201
I was.

797
00:53:15,879 --> 00:53:17,972
As I am...

798
00:53:21,251 --> 00:53:23,913
you will be.

799
00:53:27,757 --> 00:53:31,215
(woman laughing)

800
00:53:31,261 --> 00:53:33,092
(panting)

801
00:53:45,275 --> 00:53:47,300
Mike's voice:
Maybe I'm not real.

802
00:53:49,746 --> 00:53:51,839
Maybe I'm just
having a nightmare...

803
00:53:54,384 --> 00:53:56,648
an incredibly vivid

804
00:53:56,686 --> 00:53:59,120
lucid nightmare.

805
00:54:01,658 --> 00:54:04,218
When is the last time
I remember going to bed?

806
00:54:04,260 --> 00:54:06,524
(ticking)

807
00:54:06,563 --> 00:54:08,497
I flew in yesterday.

808
00:54:09,632 --> 00:54:12,931
Or was that... today?

809
00:54:13,937 --> 00:54:15,905
I can't remember.

810
00:54:15,939 --> 00:54:17,930
Was I on a train?

811
00:54:21,478 --> 00:54:23,173
I woke up somewhere

812
00:54:23,213 --> 00:54:25,272
and I had breakfast.

813
00:54:25,315 --> 00:54:28,148
Where was I?
What did I eat?

814
00:54:32,455 --> 00:54:34,446
(rumbling)

815
00:54:36,125 --> 00:54:37,615
Here it comes.

816
00:55:00,450 --> 00:55:03,613
They say you can't die
in your dreams.

817
00:55:03,653 --> 00:55:05,177
Is that true?

818
00:55:14,397 --> 00:55:16,331
(rumbles)

819
00:55:22,405 --> 00:55:24,600
(horns blaring)

820
00:55:24,641 --> 00:55:28,133
The shock
would wake you up.

821
00:55:28,177 --> 00:55:30,111
(horn blaring)

822
00:55:32,715 --> 00:55:35,741
So you couldn't
really die.

823
00:55:40,323 --> 00:55:42,188
All right,
what are our options?

824
00:55:42,225 --> 00:55:45,683
Got the hallway,
got guest rooms on either side,

825
00:55:45,728 --> 00:55:48,822
stairwell,
fire exits.

826
00:55:48,865 --> 00:55:50,628
And that's
the next window...

827
00:55:52,068 --> 00:55:53,558
the next room.

828
00:55:55,038 --> 00:55:58,496
How many feet across
is that?

829
00:55:58,541 --> 00:56:00,202
One...

830
00:56:00,243 --> 00:56:02,108
(rumbles)

831
00:56:02,145 --> 00:56:03,737
...three,

832
00:56:03,780 --> 00:56:05,304
four, five,

833
00:56:05,348 --> 00:56:09,375
six, seven, eight...

834
00:56:09,419 --> 00:56:10,750
nine.

835
00:56:11,754 --> 00:56:14,655
Nine, nine...
18 feet across.

836
00:56:17,427 --> 00:56:20,555
Okay.
I can do this.

837
00:56:26,169 --> 00:56:29,070
If something should happen,
if I should slip and fall,

838
00:56:29,105 --> 00:56:32,268
I want it to be known
that it was an accident.

839
00:56:33,443 --> 00:56:35,377
The room...

840
00:56:35,411 --> 00:56:37,276
did not win.

841
00:56:38,815 --> 00:56:40,442
Okay.

842
00:56:40,483 --> 00:56:42,348
Okay, I can do this.

843
00:56:44,120 --> 00:56:45,519
18 little steps.

844
00:56:53,496 --> 00:56:55,464
Four...

845
00:56:55,498 --> 00:56:57,898
Don't look down.
Five...

846
00:56:59,168 --> 00:57:01,068
Keep moving.

847
00:57:05,475 --> 00:57:07,340
Here we go.

848
00:57:13,016 --> 00:57:15,712
All right.
Okay.

849
00:57:15,752 --> 00:57:17,413
Number nine...

850
00:57:17,453 --> 00:57:18,977
eight...

851
00:57:20,857 --> 00:57:22,222
six...

852
00:57:26,129 --> 00:57:28,597
Where is it?
Where is it?

853
00:57:31,868 --> 00:57:35,167
(horns blaring)

854
00:57:38,007 --> 00:57:39,998
(gasping)

855
00:58:08,004 --> 00:58:09,494
(screams)

856
00:58:09,539 --> 00:58:11,871
(grunting)

857
00:58:18,247 --> 00:58:20,977
(sobbing)

858
00:58:27,090 --> 00:58:28,819
(screams)

859
00:58:49,445 --> 00:58:53,040
(groaning)

860
00:59:26,549 --> 00:59:28,176
(electricity buzzing)

861
00:59:33,790 --> 00:59:35,815
(man screaming)

862
01:00:02,752 --> 01:00:05,482
(static)

863
01:00:05,521 --> 01:00:06,988
Get ahold of yourself.

864
01:00:07,023 --> 01:00:09,116
You're running to places
that aren't real.

865
01:00:11,260 --> 01:00:12,921
(rewinding)

866
01:00:12,962 --> 01:00:15,123
Hotel rooms are naturally
creepy places.

867
01:00:19,268 --> 01:00:22,066
Strangely, the bedroom
has no window.

868
01:00:22,104 --> 01:00:23,696
(groans)

869
01:00:23,739 --> 01:00:26,333
(distorted)
Strangely, the bedroom has no window...

870
01:00:26,375 --> 01:00:29,276
- (footsteps)
- (door slams)

871
01:00:29,312 --> 01:00:31,678
Woman:
Dr. Edwards to Oncology.

872
01:00:34,317 --> 01:00:37,184
Lily:
Please, please.

873
01:00:37,220 --> 01:00:39,051
(sobbing)

874
01:00:43,793 --> 01:00:47,024
No. No. Doctors don't
know everything.

875
01:00:47,063 --> 01:00:49,031
We can get another opinion,
look for other treatment.

876
01:00:49,065 --> 01:00:51,431
- You hear about...
- Look at me.

877
01:00:51,467 --> 01:00:52,991
...miracle cures.
- Lily.

878
01:00:53,035 --> 01:00:56,300
Oh God.
Please, something.

879
01:00:56,339 --> 01:00:59,968
Mike: What kind of god would
do this to a little girl?

880
01:01:00,009 --> 01:01:02,944
(Lily sobbing)

881
01:01:07,817 --> 01:01:10,115
Katie.

882
01:01:10,152 --> 01:01:14,316
Katie:
Daddy, I can't see you.

883
01:01:14,357 --> 01:01:17,520
Daddy, I can't find you.

884
01:01:17,560 --> 01:01:20,028
Daddy, I'm scared.

885
01:01:20,062 --> 01:01:22,587
- Katie.
- I'm scared, Daddy.

886
01:01:22,632 --> 01:01:24,691
Help.

887
01:01:24,734 --> 01:01:26,463
Help me.

888
01:01:26,502 --> 01:01:28,367
Daddy, help me.

889
01:02:05,474 --> 01:02:07,339
Okay, how about
the wireless?

890
01:02:07,376 --> 01:02:08,866
Come on.

891
01:02:16,218 --> 01:02:18,550
Give me a signal.
Give me a signal.

892
01:02:18,587 --> 01:02:20,919
- (beeps)
- Computer: Good evening, Mike.

893
01:02:22,024 --> 01:02:23,491
Oh, yes!

894
01:02:24,860 --> 01:02:28,626
- (beeps)
- Mike?

895
01:02:29,632 --> 01:02:31,293
Mike, is that...
is that you?

896
01:02:31,334 --> 01:02:33,063
- I can barely see you.
- Yes yes.

897
01:02:33,102 --> 01:02:36,538
- It's like seeing a ghost.
- No no no. Yes, it's me.

898
01:02:36,572 --> 01:02:38,403
- It's me. It's Mike.
- This is a little bizarre.

899
01:02:38,441 --> 01:02:40,568
I mean, I haven't talked
to you in a year

900
01:02:40,609 --> 01:02:42,668
and suddenly you pop up
in a box on my computer.

901
01:02:42,712 --> 01:02:45,044
I'm sorry, Lily.
Listen to me, please, quickly.

902
01:02:45,081 --> 01:02:47,675
Look, I'm at work, okay? So why don't
you call me at home tonight?

903
01:02:47,717 --> 01:02:51,209
I'm trapped in this room,
this place.

904
01:02:51,253 --> 01:02:53,448
Mike, you're always trapped in weird
places. That's your job.

905
01:02:53,489 --> 01:02:55,354
- No no, please, Lily. Listen to me.
- (phone rings)

906
01:02:55,391 --> 01:02:57,222
- Please.
- Lily Enslin.

907
01:02:57,259 --> 01:02:59,227
- Hi. Yeah yeah.
- Lily!

908
01:02:59,261 --> 01:03:01,320
- I've got those. I'll be right down.
- No. Lily!

909
01:03:01,364 --> 01:03:03,662
Lily, please!
Call the cops.

910
01:03:03,699 --> 01:03:06,099
Send them
to the Dolphin Hotel.

911
01:03:06,135 --> 01:03:07,864
I'll call you back.

912
01:03:10,439 --> 01:03:12,634
- You're in the city?
- Yes!

913
01:03:12,675 --> 01:03:15,166
- 2254 Lexington.
- What are you doing in New York?

914
01:03:15,211 --> 01:03:18,647
I'll tell you later.
The Dolphin Hotel, room 1408.

915
01:03:18,681 --> 01:03:20,649
- That's just perfect.
- Please.

916
01:03:20,683 --> 01:03:22,514
You walk out, you disappear.
Leaving me what?

917
01:03:22,551 --> 01:03:24,815
Not divorced. Separated?
I don't know, it's not clear.

918
01:03:24,854 --> 01:03:27,584
- Suddenly you need me?
- Lily, I'm in a real bad spot here.

919
01:03:27,623 --> 01:03:30,387
- I'm in danger. You understand?
- Okay, Mike. Slow down.

920
01:03:30,426 --> 01:03:31,654
You're not making
any sense.

921
01:03:31,694 --> 01:03:34,822
There's something trying
to kill me right now.

922
01:03:38,734 --> 01:03:40,497
No, Lily!

923
01:03:40,536 --> 01:03:42,663
No no no!

924
01:04:06,929 --> 01:04:08,760
(water pattering)

925
01:04:43,666 --> 01:04:45,429
I've got a knife!

926
01:04:50,473 --> 01:04:51,701
(grunting)

927
01:05:01,050 --> 01:05:03,041
(mumbling)
That's the way out.

928
01:05:03,085 --> 01:05:05,144
Or that way.
Or that way.

929
01:05:08,157 --> 01:05:09,351
All right,
that's the way out.

930
01:05:09,391 --> 01:05:10,858
(baby crying)

931
01:05:10,893 --> 01:05:12,986
Lady, let me in!

932
01:05:13,028 --> 01:05:16,759
- Help! Help!
- Please, sleep.

933
01:05:16,799 --> 01:05:19,529
- Lady, I'm coming through!
- Mike!

934
01:05:19,568 --> 01:05:22,731
Mike, can you help me?
Where'd you go?

935
01:05:22,771 --> 01:05:26,207
Mike: I got to get some cigarettes.
You want something?

936
01:05:27,943 --> 01:05:30,309
Jesus Christ!

937
01:05:32,414 --> 01:05:34,143
Mike:
I've got to go. I'll be in California.

938
01:05:34,183 --> 01:05:36,117
Mike, you can't do this.

939
01:05:36,152 --> 01:05:38,382
She needs you.
She lost a kid too.

940
01:05:38,420 --> 01:05:40,888
You've got an amazing talent
for stating the obvious, Pop.

941
01:05:40,923 --> 01:05:42,151
You think
I don't know that?

942
01:05:42,191 --> 01:05:44,182
I'm trying to talk
some sense into your head!

943
01:05:44,226 --> 01:05:46,990
- Don't put your hands on me, old man!
- Mike!

944
01:05:47,029 --> 01:05:50,157
Talk? Why change what appears to be
the habit of a lifetime, Pop?

945
01:05:50,199 --> 01:05:51,632
You were always great
at passing judgment,

946
01:05:51,667 --> 01:05:53,567
but the problem is
you never gave a shit.

947
01:05:53,602 --> 01:05:56,537
I never gave a shit
because you're a bullshit writer!

948
01:06:01,110 --> 01:06:02,441
Shit!

949
01:06:10,619 --> 01:06:12,143
Hello!

950
01:06:17,459 --> 01:06:18,619
Oh.

951
01:06:43,652 --> 01:06:45,017
Kevin O'Malley.

952
01:06:50,492 --> 01:06:53,154
(screams)

953
01:06:55,798 --> 01:06:57,425
No.

954
01:06:57,466 --> 01:06:59,434
No no no no no no.

955
01:07:00,536 --> 01:07:03,061
I can't help you.

956
01:07:03,105 --> 01:07:04,538
I can't help you.

957
01:07:06,041 --> 01:07:08,601
No!

958
01:08:00,229 --> 01:08:02,220
(groans)

959
01:08:04,767 --> 01:08:06,860
It's good to be back.

960
01:08:11,674 --> 01:08:13,369
That's enough of that.

961
01:08:22,351 --> 01:08:24,148
Alcohol.

962
01:08:26,188 --> 01:08:28,247
I was just checking to see
if the accommodations

963
01:08:28,290 --> 01:08:29,882
are exceeding
your expectations.

964
01:08:29,925 --> 01:08:32,120
You know goddamn well
they are!

965
01:08:32,161 --> 01:08:35,028
- What do you want from me?
- No no no.

966
01:08:35,064 --> 01:08:37,396
What do you want?

967
01:08:37,433 --> 01:08:40,129
What do you want,
Mr. Enslin?

968
01:08:40,169 --> 01:08:42,831
- You sought this room.
- It was a job. I was doing the job.

969
01:08:42,871 --> 01:08:44,896
- I beg your pardon?
- My job! I'm a writer.

970
01:08:44,940 --> 01:08:47,909
Oh, that's right.
You don't believe in anything.

971
01:08:47,943 --> 01:08:49,638
You like shattering
people's hopes.

972
01:08:49,678 --> 01:08:50,975
Oh, that's bullshit!

973
01:08:51,013 --> 01:08:52,776
Why do you think people
believe in ghosts?

974
01:08:52,815 --> 01:08:55,181
For fun?
No.

975
01:08:55,217 --> 01:08:58,653
It's the prospect
of something after death.

976
01:08:58,687 --> 01:09:01,918
How many spirits
have you broken?

977
01:09:01,957 --> 01:09:03,754
Mike's voice:
She was in so much pain.

978
01:09:03,792 --> 01:09:05,851
Lily: I'm sure she's smiling down
on us right now.

979
01:09:05,894 --> 01:09:08,863
What do you want
from me?

980
01:09:08,897 --> 01:09:10,194
Huh?

981
01:09:10,232 --> 01:09:13,258
What do you want
from me?

982
01:09:13,302 --> 01:09:14,963
You...

983
01:09:15,971 --> 01:09:17,268
you little...

984
01:09:17,306 --> 01:09:20,275
(muttering)

985
01:09:20,309 --> 01:09:22,869
(yelling)
What do you want?

986
01:09:22,911 --> 01:09:24,902
What?!

987
01:09:27,950 --> 01:09:31,750
I want my drink!

988
01:09:43,432 --> 01:09:46,162
You win.
You win.

989
01:09:53,842 --> 01:09:55,639
- Katie: Mommy?
- Lily: Hmm?

990
01:09:55,677 --> 01:09:57,907
Katie:
Why is the Bible purple?

991
01:09:57,946 --> 01:10:00,210
(chuckles)
I don't know why it's purple.

992
01:10:00,249 --> 01:10:03,707
It was a wedding present.

993
01:10:03,752 --> 01:10:06,243
My grandmother brought it
all the way from Hungary.

994
01:10:06,288 --> 01:10:07,915
Someday it'll be yours.

995
01:10:11,560 --> 01:10:14,256
Are there people
where I'm going?

996
01:10:18,267 --> 01:10:22,431
Hey, you're not
going anywhere, kiddo.

997
01:10:22,471 --> 01:10:24,063
You're gonna stay
right here with us.

998
01:10:24,106 --> 01:10:26,131
Daddy...

999
01:10:26,175 --> 01:10:28,473
everyone dies.

1000
01:10:30,078 --> 01:10:32,410
When they're old.

1001
01:10:32,448 --> 01:10:34,040
When they're much older.

1002
01:10:34,082 --> 01:10:36,346
Okay, and then they go
to a better place.

1003
01:10:36,385 --> 01:10:39,377
And it's beautiful there.

1004
01:10:40,522 --> 01:10:42,353
And all your friends
will be there.

1005
01:10:48,163 --> 01:10:49,892
Is God there?

1006
01:10:50,933 --> 01:10:52,059
Yes.

1007
01:10:53,702 --> 01:10:55,567
Do you really
believe that, Daddy?

1008
01:10:57,139 --> 01:10:58,902
Yes.

1009
01:11:01,410 --> 01:11:03,401
Mike: You know what I think!
We should have done more!

1010
01:11:03,445 --> 01:11:05,106
- We did everything we could!
- No, we didn't!

1011
01:11:05,147 --> 01:11:07,411
- We should have helped her fight...
- Oh my God.

1012
01:11:07,449 --> 01:11:09,679
...instead of filling her head full
of these stories

1013
01:11:09,718 --> 01:11:11,982
about heavens
and the clouds and nirvana

1014
01:11:12,020 --> 01:11:13,851
and all that bullshit!

1015
01:11:13,889 --> 01:11:15,413
Those stories,
she like them.

1016
01:11:15,457 --> 01:11:17,288
I'm going to get
some cigarettes, okay?

1017
01:11:17,326 --> 01:11:19,089
(phone ringing)

1018
01:12:55,023 --> 01:12:58,151
Mike's voice:
We ponder the situation.

1019
01:12:58,193 --> 01:13:01,526
I'm trying to
accurately describe...

1020
01:13:02,798 --> 01:13:05,426
Orpheus on
the Orpheum Circuit

1021
01:13:05,467 --> 01:13:07,458
bathed in tango light,

1022
01:13:07,502 --> 01:13:10,767
the kind of light
that makes the dead...

1023
01:13:12,040 --> 01:13:14,235
get out of their graves
and tango.

1024
01:13:14,276 --> 01:13:17,370
Now this is level nine...

1025
01:13:17,412 --> 01:13:19,573
(shivering)

1026
01:13:19,615 --> 01:13:21,583
The deepest level of hell,

1027
01:13:21,617 --> 01:13:25,383
furthest removed
from all light and warmth.

1028
01:13:27,322 --> 01:13:29,256
This is six.

1029
01:13:29,291 --> 01:13:31,919
It's goddamn five.

1030
01:13:31,960 --> 01:13:34,121
I think I see
the pattern.

1031
01:13:34,162 --> 01:13:37,427
Yes, I can see
the pattern.

1032
01:13:37,466 --> 01:13:38,865
Lily:
Mike.

1033
01:13:38,900 --> 01:13:42,063
Mike, can you hear me?

1034
01:13:42,104 --> 01:13:45,198
- Michael, where the hell are you?
- Lily.

1035
01:13:45,240 --> 01:13:47,037
Michael?

1036
01:13:47,075 --> 01:13:49,100
- Mike.
- Lily.

1037
01:13:49,144 --> 01:13:51,908
(sighs)
Michael, can you hear me?

1038
01:13:51,947 --> 01:13:53,437
Lily.

1039
01:13:56,785 --> 01:13:59,618
Oh my God. Thank God.
Jesus, I've been trying to get through!

1040
01:13:59,655 --> 01:14:01,816
- Did you call the cops?
- Yeah yeah, they're at the hotel.

1041
01:14:01,857 --> 01:14:03,882
- Didn't you say the Dolphin?
- Yes.

1042
01:14:03,925 --> 01:14:06,393
- You're sure?
- Yes yes, 1408.

1043
01:14:06,428 --> 01:14:09,454
Mike, they're in 1408.

1044
01:14:09,498 --> 01:14:11,329
The room's empty.

1045
01:14:11,366 --> 01:14:12,731
Mike?

1046
01:14:13,969 --> 01:14:16,460
Michael,
can you hear me?

1047
01:14:16,505 --> 01:14:18,029
- (grunts)
- Michael?

1048
01:14:18,073 --> 01:14:20,098
Michael,
where the hell are you?

1049
01:14:20,142 --> 01:14:22,838
I'm afraid I can't express
myself in this climate.

1050
01:14:22,878 --> 01:14:24,675
Calm down, okay?
We'll figure this out.

1051
01:14:24,713 --> 01:14:26,772
- Don't panic.
- I'm supposed to die here.

1052
01:14:26,815 --> 01:14:29,249
Michael, stop it!
You're not gonna die, okay?

1053
01:14:29,284 --> 01:14:31,218
Don't move.
I can be there in 15 minutes.

1054
01:14:34,556 --> 01:14:36,854
Mike?
Michael?

1055
01:14:36,892 --> 01:14:40,020
15 minutes
isn't enough time.

1056
01:14:40,062 --> 01:14:42,462
- It'll be too late.
- No, it won't be too late.

1057
01:14:42,497 --> 01:14:43,964
- Lily.
- Don't...

1058
01:14:43,999 --> 01:14:46,399
Actually, 15 minutes
is perfect.

1059
01:14:46,435 --> 01:14:48,562
It's perfect.
Just come up. Come now.

1060
01:14:48,603 --> 01:14:49,934
- Good, yes.
- I need you.

1061
01:14:49,971 --> 01:14:51,939
You've always been someone
I can count on.

1062
01:14:51,973 --> 01:14:54,999
I know we haven't talked a lot
since... since Katie died,

1063
01:14:55,043 --> 01:14:57,910
- but I need you, sweetie.
- Wait!

1064
01:14:57,946 --> 01:15:00,346
I can't explain it here. You just have
to come here and talk to me.

1065
01:15:00,382 --> 01:15:01,508
I miss you too, but...

1066
01:15:01,550 --> 01:15:03,279
When you get here,
don't talk to anybody.

1067
01:15:03,318 --> 01:15:04,717
Just come straight up to the 14th floor.

1068
01:15:04,753 --> 01:15:06,914
- Walk through the door.
- Shut up! Shut up!

1069
01:15:06,955 --> 01:15:09,082
- It's life or death, sweetie.
- Do not come up to the room!

1070
01:15:09,124 --> 01:15:10,819
- Okay.
- Don't come up to the room!

1071
01:15:10,859 --> 01:15:12,554
- I need to talk to you about Katie.
- Don't! Shut up!

1072
01:15:12,594 --> 01:15:14,653
- Lily, don't listen to him!
- Yes, good.

1073
01:15:14,696 --> 01:15:16,493
- It's a trick! Don't come up here!
- I'll be right there.

1074
01:15:16,531 --> 01:15:18,328
(crackling)

1075
01:15:22,270 --> 01:15:24,602
Lily! Lily!

1076
01:15:31,346 --> 01:15:33,405
(groans)

1077
01:15:35,517 --> 01:15:37,712
(screaming)

1078
01:15:47,763 --> 01:15:49,230
(moans)

1079
01:15:54,236 --> 01:15:56,500
(girl screaming)

1080
01:15:56,538 --> 01:15:59,405
Woman:
My baby! My baby!

1081
01:16:00,642 --> 01:16:03,440
Man:
She's heading for the rocks!

1082
01:16:03,478 --> 01:16:06,709
I don't want to die!

1083
01:16:06,748 --> 01:16:08,079
(women screaming)

1084
01:16:08,116 --> 01:16:11,381
- (dogs barking)
- (horse whinnies)

1085
01:16:23,131 --> 01:16:25,622
Man:
Oh God!

1086
01:16:25,667 --> 01:16:27,760
Man overboard!

1087
01:16:28,770 --> 01:16:30,897
(screaming continues)

1088
01:16:33,141 --> 01:16:34,802
Come on!

1089
01:16:41,616 --> 01:16:43,811
(gasping)

1090
01:17:41,009 --> 01:17:42,977
(coughs)

1091
01:17:43,011 --> 01:17:45,241
(airplane buzzing)

1092
01:17:56,892 --> 01:17:59,156
Are you okay, buddy?

1093
01:17:59,194 --> 01:18:00,855
Hey, are you breathing?

1094
01:18:02,664 --> 01:18:04,632
Man:
Come on, talk to me.

1095
01:18:04,666 --> 01:18:07,066
You guys,
give me a hand here!

1096
01:18:07,102 --> 01:18:09,400
(machine beeping)

1097
01:18:14,643 --> 01:18:17,771
Woman:
Dr. Edwards to Oncology, please.

1098
01:18:22,884 --> 01:18:25,375
Hey.

1099
01:18:25,420 --> 01:18:27,513
How are you feeling?

1100
01:18:29,190 --> 01:18:31,215
- Am I out?
- You're okay. You're okay.

1101
01:18:31,259 --> 01:18:32,556
Lie down,
lie down, lie down.

1102
01:18:32,594 --> 01:18:34,721
Lie down, lie down, lie down.
You're okay.

1103
01:18:34,763 --> 01:18:36,321
You're in the hospital.

1104
01:18:36,364 --> 01:18:38,525
Hospital where?
In New York?

1105
01:18:38,566 --> 01:18:39,999
New York?
No no, you're in LA.

1106
01:18:40,035 --> 01:18:43,004
You got hit on the head
with your board.

1107
01:18:43,038 --> 01:18:44,699
I can't believe
you still surf.

1108
01:18:46,141 --> 01:18:47,938
You flew here
just for me?

1109
01:18:47,976 --> 01:18:50,968
Yeah. Yeah,
I was worried.

1110
01:18:51,012 --> 01:18:53,207
They called.

1111
01:18:53,248 --> 01:18:55,773
I think I'm still listed
as your next of kin.

1112
01:18:55,817 --> 01:18:58,251
Okay, I'm not in New York.

1113
01:18:58,286 --> 01:19:00,754
- I'm out.
- Why do you keep saying that?

1114
01:19:03,391 --> 01:19:05,586
I was in New York.
I was trapped.

1115
01:19:05,627 --> 01:19:08,391
In New York,
I was dying

1116
01:19:08,430 --> 01:19:10,762
in this Kafkaesque hotel,

1117
01:19:10,799 --> 01:19:12,960
the Dolphin.

1118
01:19:13,001 --> 01:19:16,027
- What?
- The Dolphin Hotel on 45th and Lex.

1119
01:19:16,071 --> 01:19:17,629
- I spoke with you there.
- 45th and Lex?

1120
01:19:17,672 --> 01:19:19,833
- I called you.
- I've never heard of it.

1121
01:19:22,477 --> 01:19:25,969
You're gonna be okay.
You just need to rest.

1122
01:19:43,431 --> 01:19:46,696
Oh, we have a winner.

1123
01:19:48,770 --> 01:19:50,601
600 bucks.

1124
01:20:02,017 --> 01:20:04,611
Unbelievable.

1125
01:20:04,652 --> 01:20:06,813
I can see why
you live here.

1126
01:20:13,361 --> 01:20:15,761
Why did you leave?

1127
01:20:22,303 --> 01:20:24,794
Because every time
I looked at you,

1128
01:20:24,839 --> 01:20:26,807
I saw her face.

1129
01:20:37,719 --> 01:20:39,710
Lily:
I think it's pretty clear.

1130
01:20:39,754 --> 01:20:41,619
I think in the dream
the room's your subconscious

1131
01:20:41,656 --> 01:20:43,487
and it brought up
a lot of stuff.

1132
01:20:43,525 --> 01:20:45,322
That's a good thing
for you.

1133
01:20:45,360 --> 01:20:47,385
But this was... I mean, I was down
the rabbit hole.

1134
01:20:47,429 --> 01:20:49,829
I was rattled.
I was shook up.

1135
01:20:49,864 --> 01:20:51,729
And I can't shake it.
I think after dinner

1136
01:20:51,766 --> 01:20:53,233
you should drive me
back to the hospital,

1137
01:20:53,268 --> 01:20:56,169
- check me into the psych unit.
- (chuckles)

1138
01:20:57,872 --> 01:20:59,965
You look really great.

1139
01:21:00,008 --> 01:21:02,533
I can't believe
I'm sitting here with you.

1140
01:21:04,045 --> 01:21:05,569
Tell me about it.

1141
01:21:05,613 --> 01:21:07,808
Is everything all right?
Can I get you anything else?

1142
01:21:07,849 --> 01:21:11,148
I'll have another
glass of wine, please.

1143
01:21:11,186 --> 01:21:13,746
The same.

1144
01:21:16,024 --> 01:21:17,514
Mike?

1145
01:21:17,559 --> 01:21:19,186
Yeah, I'll have
another tequila...

1146
01:21:19,227 --> 01:21:20,717
Patron, chilled,
double.

1147
01:21:20,762 --> 01:21:22,320
Be right back.

1148
01:21:28,837 --> 01:21:30,896
Katie was there.

1149
01:21:32,474 --> 01:21:33,907
Mmm-hm.

1150
01:21:36,244 --> 01:21:37,802
Can you imagine

1151
01:21:37,846 --> 01:21:40,212
what it feels like
to have the sensation?

1152
01:21:40,248 --> 01:21:42,273
I mean, the very
real sensation

1153
01:21:42,317 --> 01:21:44,308
that I talked to her,
like, two days ago?

1154
01:21:44,352 --> 01:21:47,116
I talked to her,
saw her, touched her.

1155
01:21:47,155 --> 01:21:49,521
Yeah.

1156
01:21:49,557 --> 01:21:52,253
I see her every night
when I shut my eyes.

1157
01:21:54,062 --> 01:21:55,689
Yeah, but it was so vivid.

1158
01:21:55,730 --> 01:21:58,824
It was so real.

1159
01:21:58,867 --> 01:22:00,767
Maybe you should
write about it.

1160
01:22:00,802 --> 01:22:03,396
About Katie?
Shit.

1161
01:22:03,438 --> 01:22:06,271
- You always were tougher than me.
- Why not?

1162
01:22:06,307 --> 01:22:09,299
Seriously, it sounds like
you're ready to deal with this stuff.

1163
01:22:13,581 --> 01:22:16,015
Can you stay?

1164
01:22:25,426 --> 01:22:27,792
I'm sorry.

1165
01:22:32,500 --> 01:22:35,060
Okay, we have got 148.

1166
01:22:35,103 --> 01:22:37,594
148 is gonna be
right about...

1167
01:22:37,639 --> 01:22:40,403
Uh-huh.

1168
01:22:40,441 --> 01:22:43,501
So if you'd like
to sign on the line.

1169
01:22:45,513 --> 01:22:47,447
Hey!
Hey, man!

1170
01:22:47,482 --> 01:22:49,712
You've been
gone a while.

1171
01:22:49,751 --> 01:22:52,686
Oh, by the way,
dude, I read your book.

1172
01:22:52,720 --> 01:22:56,622
What is it?
"10 Most Haunted Motels," right?

1173
01:22:56,658 --> 01:22:58,558
That's some scary shit.

1174
01:23:02,163 --> 01:23:04,859
See you around.

1175
01:23:42,637 --> 01:23:44,400
Did I drop a postcard?

1176
01:23:44,439 --> 01:23:45,929
- What?
- Did I?

1177
01:23:45,974 --> 01:23:47,498
- Huh?
- A postcard.

1178
01:23:47,542 --> 01:23:50,136
No, I think I would
have seen it.

1179
01:23:52,747 --> 01:23:54,408
But if I find it,
I'll put it in your mailbox.

1180
01:23:54,449 --> 01:23:56,110
Okay?

1181
01:24:26,547 --> 01:24:29,675
Mike: My experience in the room
was terrifying,

1182
01:24:29,717 --> 01:24:33,209
a fragmented loop
of unease and despair.

1183
01:24:33,254 --> 01:24:35,347
1408 was a horrible dream,

1184
01:24:35,390 --> 01:24:39,986
yet somehow
I awoke from it renewed.

1185
01:24:40,028 --> 01:24:42,428
Sam:
Mikey! You sound happy.

1186
01:24:42,463 --> 01:24:44,226
- You're scaring me.
- I wouldn't go that far,

1187
01:24:44,265 --> 01:24:46,756
but I must say that the work
is just pouring out of me.

1188
01:24:46,801 --> 01:24:49,167
I think I've actually
reinvented myself

1189
01:24:49,203 --> 01:24:52,070
in the form of a kind
of a fictional memoir...

1190
01:24:52,106 --> 01:24:53,835
"Autobiography
of a Nightmare:

1191
01:24:53,875 --> 01:24:56,343
Truman Capote meets H.R. Giger."
What do you think?

1192
01:24:56,377 --> 01:24:59,175
I love it!
"'Ln Cold Blood' with 'Aliens!"'

1193
01:24:59,213 --> 01:25:01,545
That's sexy.
I wanna put it out to auction,

1194
01:25:01,582 --> 01:25:04,073
start a bidding war.
When can I read it?

1195
01:25:04,118 --> 01:25:06,951
Easy, tiger. Any day now.
You're gonna get it as soon as I finish.

1196
01:25:06,988 --> 01:25:09,183
Okay, Mike.
Less talking, more writing.

1197
01:25:09,223 --> 01:25:11,714
Hey, where's that decaf?
I'm dying here.

1198
01:25:38,319 --> 01:25:40,116
Thank you.

1199
01:25:53,735 --> 01:25:55,259
Hey, Pop.

1200
01:26:03,177 --> 01:26:06,010
How are you doing,
old boy?

1201
01:26:06,047 --> 01:26:09,483
Can you hear me?

1202
01:26:09,517 --> 01:26:11,712
I don't think so.

1203
01:26:21,262 --> 01:26:22,923
I know I haven't been
here in a few months,

1204
01:26:22,964 --> 01:26:25,728
but I just wanted to...

1205
01:26:25,767 --> 01:26:28,497
come by and see
how you're doing and...

1206
01:26:30,471 --> 01:26:34,100
tell you I was doing okay.

1207
01:26:34,142 --> 01:26:37,737
Doing pretty good, actually.

1208
01:26:39,213 --> 01:26:42,671
I started talking
to Lily again.

1209
01:26:42,717 --> 01:26:46,414
And I wrote a new book,

1210
01:26:46,454 --> 01:26:49,287
which I actually think
you would like...

1211
01:26:51,459 --> 01:26:54,053
believe it or not.

1212
01:26:54,095 --> 01:26:57,462
(sighs)

1213
01:27:01,369 --> 01:27:03,098
Michael.

1214
01:27:03,137 --> 01:27:06,300
Dad.

1215
01:27:06,340 --> 01:27:09,741
Michael.

1216
01:27:09,777 --> 01:27:13,144
Yeah.

1217
01:27:13,181 --> 01:27:16,378
Yeah.

1218
01:27:23,524 --> 01:27:25,958
So...

1219
01:27:29,163 --> 01:27:30,824
(horn blowing)

1220
01:27:30,865 --> 01:27:34,164
Man: Hey, you can't park there!
Move it down, will you?

1221
01:27:34,202 --> 01:27:37,603
Hey, I got a package
I need to overnight.

1222
01:27:37,638 --> 01:27:40,801
Is this the right form? I got to get
this to New York by tomorrow morning.

1223
01:27:40,842 --> 01:27:42,469
Man:
I'm sorry, sir, but we're closed.

1224
01:27:47,548 --> 01:27:48,879
Very well.

1225
01:28:56,183 --> 01:28:58,014
(mumbling)

1226
01:29:28,716 --> 01:29:30,547
(squeaking)

1227
01:30:02,683 --> 01:30:05,117
I was out.

1228
01:30:07,121 --> 01:30:08,952
Is that Katie?

1229
01:30:08,990 --> 01:30:11,652
(sobbing)
Is that Katie?

1230
01:30:11,692 --> 01:30:14,024
I was out.

1231
01:30:19,400 --> 01:30:22,733
I was out!

1232
01:30:24,639 --> 01:30:26,732
I was out.
Please, God.

1233
01:30:26,774 --> 01:30:29,470
I know I was out.

1234
01:30:29,510 --> 01:30:32,843
(rumbling)

1235
01:31:12,253 --> 01:31:14,346
(knocking)

1236
01:31:17,758 --> 01:31:19,953
Yeah.

1237
01:31:25,032 --> 01:31:26,897
Open it.

1238
01:31:26,934 --> 01:31:28,868
(doorknob rattling)

1239
01:31:33,240 --> 01:31:36,073
(creaking)

1240
01:31:38,612 --> 01:31:40,807
(children laughing)

1241
01:31:42,583 --> 01:31:45,416
Preacher:
...are yawning up widely in our path.

1242
01:31:45,453 --> 01:31:49,116
We know the way
of the righteous man.

1243
01:31:49,156 --> 01:31:53,024
(girl giggling)

1244
01:31:53,060 --> 01:31:55,085
Katie: Daddy.

1245
01:31:58,799 --> 01:32:02,496
- Daddy?
- No.

1246
01:32:02,536 --> 01:32:05,232
- You're not Katie.
- I need help.

1247
01:32:05,272 --> 01:32:08,002
- (panting)
- Please.

1248
01:32:08,042 --> 01:32:09,373
You're not real.

1249
01:32:09,410 --> 01:32:10,843
I'm cold.

1250
01:32:10,878 --> 01:32:13,779
- You're not Katie.
- So cold.

1251
01:32:17,418 --> 01:32:19,079
(glass crunching)

1252
01:32:31,966 --> 01:32:33,593
I love you, Daddy.

1253
01:32:35,302 --> 01:32:38,465
Don't you love me anymore?

1254
01:32:38,506 --> 01:32:40,770
Of course I do,
sweetheart.

1255
01:32:42,409 --> 01:32:45,003
There we go.
I got you.

1256
01:32:46,480 --> 01:32:48,641
I got you now, Katie.

1257
01:32:48,682 --> 01:32:51,742
- Oh my God.
- They won't let me stay.

1258
01:32:51,786 --> 01:32:54,346
- Yes, they will.
- They won't let me stay.

1259
01:32:54,388 --> 01:32:56,253
- What?
- They won't let me stay.

1260
01:32:56,290 --> 01:32:59,623
No no no no no. Nobody's ever going
to take you away again.

1261
01:32:59,660 --> 01:33:03,494
I got you now, Katie.
Oh my God.

1262
01:33:03,531 --> 01:33:05,294
- I'm not gonna let you go.
- Do you love me, Daddy?

1263
01:33:05,332 --> 01:33:07,766
Of course I do. I love you more than
anything in the world.

1264
01:33:07,802 --> 01:33:09,770
I wish we could
stay together,

1265
01:33:09,804 --> 01:33:11,101
you, me, and Mommy.

1266
01:33:11,138 --> 01:33:14,335
We can, we can.
I got you right here.

1267
01:33:14,375 --> 01:33:17,902
I got you right here, sweetie.
Everything's fine.

1268
01:33:17,945 --> 01:33:19,742
Everything is fine.

1269
01:33:31,392 --> 01:33:34,259
(sobbing)

1270
01:33:37,231 --> 01:33:38,926
No.
No.

1271
01:33:38,966 --> 01:33:41,901
No. No.

1272
01:33:41,936 --> 01:33:43,870
You can't take her twice.

1273
01:33:45,806 --> 01:33:47,467
You can't.

1274
01:33:48,909 --> 01:33:51,878
Not again.
Please, God.

1275
01:33:51,912 --> 01:33:55,075
You can't.

1276
01:33:56,317 --> 01:33:58,342
Please.

1277
01:33:58,385 --> 01:34:00,353
No!

1278
01:34:00,387 --> 01:34:02,218
No.

1279
01:34:02,256 --> 01:34:05,248
- You bastard.
- # We fly #

1280
01:34:07,728 --> 01:34:12,859
# So many roads
to choose #

1281
01:34:12,900 --> 01:34:18,463
# We start out walking
and learn to run #

1282
01:34:18,505 --> 01:34:20,700
# And yet
we've just begun... #

1283
01:34:30,050 --> 01:34:31,483
(groans)

1284
01:34:31,518 --> 01:34:33,110
You little...

1285
01:34:33,153 --> 01:34:34,677
where is it?

1286
01:34:34,722 --> 01:34:36,952
Where?!
Where?!

1287
01:35:05,219 --> 01:35:10,486
(distorted) # We'll find a place
where there's room to grow #

1288
01:35:10,524 --> 01:35:14,927
# And yes,
we've just begun #

1289
01:35:18,165 --> 01:35:21,965
# Sharing horizons
that are new to us #

1290
01:35:23,671 --> 01:35:28,631
# Watching the signs
along the way #

1291
01:35:28,676 --> 01:35:31,873
# Talking it over,
just the two of us. #

1292
01:35:31,912 --> 01:35:32,446
(music stops)

1293
01:35:32,446 --> 01:35:33,606
(music stops)

1294
01:35:38,552 --> 01:35:40,952
(clock clicking)

1295
01:35:49,663 --> 01:35:52,291
(phone ringing)

1296
01:36:22,730 --> 01:36:24,561
Why don't you
just kill me?

1297
01:36:24,598 --> 01:36:26,463
Woman:
Because all guests of this hotel

1298
01:36:26,500 --> 01:36:28,297
enjoy free will,
Mr. Enslin.

1299
01:36:28,335 --> 01:36:31,031
You can choose to relive this hour
over and over,

1300
01:36:31,071 --> 01:36:34,336
or you can take advantage
of our express checkout system.

1301
01:37:05,506 --> 01:37:07,667
Mr. Enslin?

1302
01:37:19,053 --> 01:37:20,611
(wind howling)

1303
01:37:26,293 --> 01:37:28,056
(rumbling)

1304
01:37:34,234 --> 01:37:37,203
(flies buzzing)

1305
01:37:38,238 --> 01:37:40,433
(screams)

1306
01:37:51,218 --> 01:37:53,709
Are you ready to check out,
Mr. Enslin?

1307
01:37:56,857 --> 01:37:58,950
No.

1308
01:37:58,992 --> 01:38:01,153
- Not your way.
- I understand.

1309
01:38:02,930 --> 01:38:04,488
(rings)

1310
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:09,298
By the way, Mr. Enslin,
your wife just called.

1311
01:38:09,336 --> 01:38:11,964
She'll be here in five minutes
and we'll send her straight up.

1312
01:38:12,005 --> 01:38:14,337
She's not involved.

1313
01:38:14,374 --> 01:38:17,207
You can't have her.

1314
01:38:17,244 --> 01:38:20,042
I'm done arguing with you.

1315
01:38:22,850 --> 01:38:24,613
I'm gonna end this.

1316
01:38:24,651 --> 01:38:26,676
Five.
This is five.

1317
01:38:26,720 --> 01:38:29,712
(voice distorts) Ignore the siren.
Even if you leave this room,

1318
01:38:29,756 --> 01:38:32,190
you can never
leave this room.

1319
01:38:32,226 --> 01:38:36,094
Eight.
This is eight.

1320
01:38:36,130 --> 01:38:39,395
We have killed
your friends.

1321
01:38:39,433 --> 01:38:41,958
Every friend

1322
01:38:42,002 --> 01:38:44,664
is now dead.

1323
01:38:54,848 --> 01:38:58,340
Mike's voice:
I lived the life of a selfish man.

1324
01:38:58,385 --> 01:39:01,786
But I don't have
to die that way.

1325
01:39:03,357 --> 01:39:04,756
If I'm going down,

1326
01:39:04,791 --> 01:39:07,954
I'm taking you with me.

1327
01:39:11,131 --> 01:39:13,099
This may not all be real,

1328
01:39:13,133 --> 01:39:15,795
and I may not even be real,

1329
01:39:15,836 --> 01:39:18,134
but this fire...

1330
01:39:21,041 --> 01:39:23,373
that's got to be real.

1331
01:39:33,554 --> 01:39:35,317
Go to hell!

1332
01:39:37,991 --> 01:39:39,856
(fire alarm ringing)

1333
01:39:53,774 --> 01:39:55,833
(clamoring)

1334
01:39:57,678 --> 01:39:59,145
Get out onto the street!

1335
01:39:59,179 --> 01:40:01,204
Out the doors
and onto the street, please.

1336
01:40:01,248 --> 01:40:03,648
Everyone stay calm.

1337
01:40:03,684 --> 01:40:06,847
- (honking)
- (sirens wailing)

1338
01:40:06,887 --> 01:40:09,981
- What's going on?
- Driver: I don't know, lady.

1339
01:40:10,023 --> 01:40:13,254
This might take a while.
Something must have happened.

1340
01:40:13,293 --> 01:40:15,659
Thanks.

1341
01:40:15,696 --> 01:40:18,062
(distorted music playing)

1342
01:40:21,368 --> 01:40:23,393
(man moaning)

1343
01:40:23,437 --> 01:40:26,736
Keep quiet,
you bastard.

1344
01:40:28,542 --> 01:40:30,373
Please, you've gotta help me.
No, help me.

1345
01:40:30,410 --> 01:40:31,775
- Calm down.
- My husband's inside.

1346
01:40:31,812 --> 01:40:33,871
My husband's inside.
You've gotta help him.

1347
01:40:33,914 --> 01:40:35,677
You've gotta help him,
please!

1348
01:40:35,716 --> 01:40:37,115
What floor?
What floor?

1349
01:40:37,150 --> 01:40:39,277
14th floor, 1408.
Mike Enslin.

1350
01:40:39,319 --> 01:40:41,753
Please come here.

1351
01:40:41,788 --> 01:40:45,588
- (moaning)
- You're wasting your time.

1352
01:40:51,098 --> 01:40:53,692
We're here
to do the job,

1353
01:40:53,734 --> 01:40:55,861
and we don't rattle.

1354
01:40:59,306 --> 01:41:02,036
The decor is in tatters

1355
01:41:02,075 --> 01:41:03,975
and the staff surly.

1356
01:41:04,011 --> 01:41:06,946
But on the Shiver Scale...

1357
01:41:08,348 --> 01:41:11,613
I award the Dolphin
10 skulls!

1358
01:41:22,262 --> 01:41:24,457
(crowd screaming)

1359
01:41:33,106 --> 01:41:35,438
(coughing)

1360
01:41:35,475 --> 01:41:38,342
Never kill
more than you can eat.

1361
01:41:45,285 --> 01:41:47,185
(chuckling)

1362
01:41:47,220 --> 01:41:50,348
Katie:
Daddy, everyone dies.

1363
01:41:50,390 --> 01:41:52,517
(laughing)

1364
01:42:21,054 --> 01:42:24,285
We commend to Almighty God
our brother,

1365
01:42:24,324 --> 01:42:27,384
and we commit his body
to the ground,

1366
01:42:27,427 --> 01:42:30,988
earth to earth,
ashes to ashes,

1367
01:42:31,031 --> 01:42:34,592
dust to dust.

1368
01:42:34,634 --> 01:42:36,295
May you rest in peace.

1369
01:42:36,336 --> 01:42:38,133
Amen.

1370
01:42:38,171 --> 01:42:39,900
All: Amen.

1371
01:42:39,940 --> 01:42:42,408
Well, they're together now.

1372
01:42:46,580 --> 01:42:48,844
Let's go.

1373
01:42:56,289 --> 01:42:58,484
Olin:
Mrs. Enslin?

1374
01:43:02,829 --> 01:43:05,320
I...

1375
01:43:05,365 --> 01:43:07,731
I am sorry to intrude at such
a delicate time,

1376
01:43:07,768 --> 01:43:10,566
but I knew your husband.
I worked at the Dolphin.

1377
01:43:10,604 --> 01:43:12,572
Oh.

1378
01:43:12,606 --> 01:43:15,473
While we were cleaning up,
we came across some of his belongings.

1379
01:43:15,509 --> 01:43:17,875
No, thank you.

1380
01:43:17,911 --> 01:43:19,902
They are of such
a personal nature, ma'am.

1381
01:43:19,946 --> 01:43:22,073
- I figured maybe you would want to...
- No, please.

1382
01:43:22,115 --> 01:43:24,310
It's not how
I want to remember him.

1383
01:43:24,351 --> 01:43:26,751
I'm sure you understand.

1384
01:43:26,787 --> 01:43:28,448
Oh yes, yes.
Of course I understand.

1385
01:43:28,488 --> 01:43:31,150
But it's important that you know
that he did a great thing.

1386
01:43:31,191 --> 01:43:33,386
He did not die
in vain.

1387
01:43:33,427 --> 01:43:35,725
What are you talking about?

1388
01:43:35,762 --> 01:43:37,923
Because of him,
the room won't reopen. It's been...

1389
01:43:37,964 --> 01:43:40,057
All right, okay, stop.

1390
01:43:40,100 --> 01:43:42,933
Just give
the lady some air.

1391
01:43:42,969 --> 01:43:45,199
She's been through enough,
don't you think?

1392
01:44:26,012 --> 01:44:29,914
(static)

1393
01:44:29,950 --> 01:44:31,975
Mike:
Round one goes to the hideous Mr. Olin

1394
01:44:32,018 --> 01:44:33,315
for effective
aggressiveness.

1395
01:44:33,353 --> 01:44:35,787
I have to admit,
he had me going.

1396
01:44:35,822 --> 01:44:37,255
Get ahold of yourself.

1397
01:44:37,290 --> 01:44:39,952
You're running to places
that aren't real.

1398
01:44:39,993 --> 01:44:41,517
Katie:
Daddy,

1399
01:44:41,561 --> 01:44:43,552
don't you
love me anymore?

1400
01:44:43,597 --> 01:44:45,724
Mike:
Of course I do, sweetheart.

1401
01:44:45,765 --> 01:44:48,325
- Don't you love me, Daddy?
- Of course I do, honey,

1402
01:44:48,368 --> 01:44:50,563
more than anything.
I got you now.

1403
01:44:50,604 --> 01:44:53,232
I got you right here, sweetie.
Everything's fine.

1404
01:44:53,273 --> 01:44:56,640
I got you, Katie.
Nobody's ever gonna take you away again.

1405
01:44:56,676 --> 01:44:58,473
Katie:
Daddy?

1406
01:44:58,512 --> 01:45:01,572
Daddy!
Daddy!

1407
01:45:01,615 --> 01:45:03,674
Daddy!

1408
01:45:03,717 --> 01:45:06,049
Daddy!

1409
01:45:10,223 --> 01:45:11,850
(screams)

1410
01:45:14,494 --> 01:45:16,052
Hey, sweetie.

1411
01:45:55,201 --> 01:45:57,863
(siren wailing)

1412
01:46:07,547 --> 01:46:10,072
(wind howling)

1413
01:46:16,556 --> 01:46:18,717
Katie:
Daddy!

1414
01:46:18,758 --> 01:46:21,750
Daddy!

1415
01:46:21,795 --> 01:46:24,263
Yes, of course.

1416
01:46:29,135 --> 01:46:31,262
(door slams)

1417
01:46:34,708 --> 01:46:36,938
(instrumental music playing)
