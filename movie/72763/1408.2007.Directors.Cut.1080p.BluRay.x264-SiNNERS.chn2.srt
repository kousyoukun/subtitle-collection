那我們就生活在地獄的第７層

534
00:31:04,662 --> 00:31:07,096
It does have its charms.
那的確很吸引人

535
00:31:12,470 --> 00:31:14,438
(traffic noise)

536
00:31:14,472 --> 00:31:17,635
The panorama is typically cramped New York City view of nothing:
窗外是典型的紐約街景

537
00:31:17,675 --> 00:31:20,371
Dull, grey buildings all around;
四周是灰暗，陰沉的建筑

538
00:31:20,411 --> 00:31:23,676
Honking traffic below. The view of a...
街上車水馬龍 一片…的景象

539
00:31:23,714 --> 00:31:27,081
- Radio: # We've only just begun... # - Ow!

540
00:31:27,118 --> 00:31:31,248
- # To live... # - Holy shit.
媽的

541
00:31:31,289 --> 00:31:35,589
# White lace and promises #

542
00:31:37,061 --> 00:31:41,964
# A kiss for luck and we're on our way #

543
00:31:41,999 --> 00:31:45,491
# We've only begun #

544
00:31:45,536 --> 00:31:48,835
# Before the rising sun... #

545
00:31:48,873 --> 00:31:51,842
Bravo, Olin. That is very unsettling.
干得好，奧林 真嚇人啊

546
00:31:53,444 --> 00:31:58,746
# So many roads to choose #

547
00:31:58,783 --> 00:32:04,415
# We start off walking and learn to run #

548
00:32:04,455 --> 00:32:06,389
# And yet we've just begun... #

549
00:32:06,424 --> 00:32:08,688
That means someone's in the room.
也就是說，房里有人

550
00:32:11,929 --> 00:32:15,194
Hello?
有人嗎？

551
00:32:15,233 --> 00:32:16,393
Hello!
有人嗎？

552
00:32:19,971 --> 00:32:21,097
Whoa.

553
00:32:25,743 --> 00:32:27,176
That is bizarre.
這可奇怪了

554
00:32:29,347 --> 00:32:31,144
(turns off radio)

555
00:32:31,182 --> 00:32:33,616
Finally I got something to write about.
我終于有東西可寫了

556
00:32:33,651 --> 00:32:36,119
A ghost that offers turn-down service.
來給我打掃房間的鬼魂

557
00:32:36,153 --> 00:32:37,848
(chuckles)

558
00:32:39,557 --> 00:32:41,320
All right.
好吧

559
00:32:41,359 --> 00:32:44,192
All right, let's Encyclopedia Brown this bitch.
好吧 現在就來找出這個混蛋

560
00:32:44,228 --> 00:32:46,196
Started off the window,
我開始正在看窗外

561
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:48,255
hear the music, nab my head.
聽到音樂后 馬上回過頭來

562
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:50,767
I turn around, go to the bed for the chocolate.
接著轉身到床邊 拿了巧克力

563
00:32:50,801 --> 00:32:52,769
Then I go into the closet which would have...
之后我去了壁櫥那

564
00:32:52,803 --> 00:32:54,794
my back was turned. It would have let
背朝著那邊

565
00:32:54,839 --> 00:32:58,206
Houdini have time to come in here do the paper trick...
所以說他有足夠的時間 跑回來在手紙上做手腳

566
00:32:58,242 --> 00:33:00,870
and he's in the living room.
他現在應該在客廳！

567
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,421
Out!
出來！

568
00:33:23,334 --> 00:33:24,801
Huh.

569
00:33:29,707 --> 00:33:31,402
(air blowing)

570
00:33:31,442 --> 00:33:33,171
Hello?

571
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:45,550
You're gonna have to try harder, asshole!

Nice and warm for you up there?

573
00:33:47,658 --> 00:33:49,319
It's hot down here, bubba.

退房，不，我為什么要退房呢？

特別是你們還提供這么優秀的服務 考慮太周到了

How many sarcophagal chambers?

lucid nightmare.

820
00:54:01,738 --> 00:54:04,298
When is the last time I remember going to bed?
我上次是睡覺是什么時候？

821
00:54:04,340 --> 00:54:06,604
(ticking)

822
00:54:06,643 --> 00:54:08,577
I flew in yesterday.
昨晚嗎？

823
00:54:09,712 --> 00:54:13,011
Or was that... today?
還是…今天？我不記得了

824
00:54:14,017 --> 00:54:15,985
I can't remember.

00:54:16,019 --> 00:54:18,010
Was I on a train?
我是在火車上么？

826
00:54:21,558 --> 00:54:23,253
I woke up somewhere
我醒了，之后吃了早飯

827
00:54:23,293 --> 00:54:25,352

828
00:54:25,395 --> 00:54:28,228
Where was I? What did I eat?
那是在哪里？我都吃了什么？

829
00:54:32,535 --> 00:54:34,526
(rumbling)

830
00:54:36,205 --> 00:54:37,695
Here it comes.
又來了

831
00:55:00,530 --> 00:55:03,693
They say you can't die in your dreams.
人們都說在夢中 是死不了的，是真的嗎？

832
00:55:03,733 --> 00:55:05,257
Is that true?

833
00:55:14,477 --> 00:55:16,411
(rumbles)

834
00:55:22,485 --> 00:55:24,680

The shock would wake you up.
嚇一跳就會醒的

836
00:55:28,257 --> 00:55:30,191
(horn blaring)

837
00:55:32,795 --> 00:55:35,821
So you couldn't really die.
所以你不會真死

838
00:55:40,403 --> 00:55:42,268
All right, what are our options?
好了，該怎么走？

839
00:55:42,305 --> 00:55:45,763
Got the hallway, got guest rooms on either side,

How many feet across is that?
離這里有多遠？

844
00:55:58,621 --> 00:56:00,282
One...

If something should happen, if I should slip and fall,
要是出了事，萬一我摔下去

853
00:56:29,185 --> 00:56:32,348
I want it to be known that it was an accident.

854
00:56:33,523 --> 00:56:35,457
The room...
而不是那房間贏了

855
00:56:35,491 --> 00:56:37,356
did not win.

856

00:57:38,087 --> 00:57:40,078
(gasping)

870
00:58:08,084 --> 00:58:09,574
(screams)

871
00:58:09,619 --> 00:58:11,951

(static)

879
01:00:05,601 --> 01:00:07,068
Get ahold of yourself.
<i>冷靜，你知道這些都是幻覺</i>

880
01:00:07,103 --> 01:00:09,196
You're running to places that aren't real.

881
01:00:11,340 --> 01:00:13,001
(rewinding)

882

Hotel rooms are naturally creepy places.

No. No. Doctors don't know everything.

905
01:02:02,353 --> 01:02:04,053
[無網絡]

01:02:05,554 --> 01:02:07,419
Okay, how about the wireless?
我還有無線網絡

907

我也不知道，是結婚禮物

1009
01:10:00,329 --> 01:10:03,787
