一生充满了罪恶
Preacher on radio: Reckless sinful way throughout this life.

7
00:00:45,878 --> 00:00:47,311
主告诉我…
The Lord has told me

8
00:00:47,347 --> 00:00:49,645
地狱的大门…
that the open gates of Hell

9
00:00:49,682 --> 00:00:52,378
…正张着血盆大口 等在我们前行的路上
are yawning up widely in our path.

10
00:00:52,418 --> 00:00:54,283
诅咒之火…
Yes, the flames

11
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,413
of perpetual damnation

12
00:00:56,456 --> 00:00:59,425
…时刻想吞噬我们的灵魂
are ever ready to grasp our souls.

13
00:00:59,459 --> 00:01:02,587
我们知道什么样的人 是正义的
We know the way of the righteous man.

14
00:01:02,628 --> 00:01:04,687
我们知道正义的人在祷告
Yeah, we know the prayer

15
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:06,392
of the righteous man.

16
00:01:15,675 --> 00:01:18,940
我告诉你们主已经讲过
I'm telling you that the Lord has spoken.

17
00:01:18,978 --> 00:01:22,106
是的，主跟我说过话
Yes, the Lord has spoken to me.

18
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:39,391
(bell rings)

19
00:01:46,272 --> 00:01:48,035
你好
Hi.

20
00:01:48,074 --> 00:01:50,133
我是麦克・安斯林，登记入住
Mike Enslin. Checking in.

21
00:01:50,176 --> 00:01:52,701
亲爱的 安斯林先生
Honey. Mr. Enslin.

22
00:01:52,745 --> 00:01:54,303
我们还担心你不来了呢
We were afraid you weren't going to show.

23
00:01:54,347 --> 00:01:57,043
您的光临真是令小店蓬筚生辉
Oh it's such an honor to have you here.

24
00:01:57,083 --> 00:01:58,948
- 今晚天气可真糟啊 - 能不能把钥匙给我
- Terrible night out there. - If I could just get the key,

25
00:01:58,985 --> 00:02:00,680
我先安顿下来 我们明早再聊…
I'll settle in and we can talk in the morning after...

26
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,813
你大概想听听我们这儿闹鬼的事吧
You probably want to hear all about our haunted history.

27
00:02:02,855 --> 00:02:05,153
看，这边的楼梯
Well, this staircase here, this is where the maid

28
00:02:05,191 --> 00:02:07,489
这里据说就是１８６０年 女仆上吊的地方
reputedly hung herself in 1860.

29
00:02:07,527 --> 00:02:08,960
- 哦 - 这有张照片
- Oh. - There's a picture!

30
00:02:08,995 --> 00:02:10,485
- 这些能不能明天早上再谈？ - 等等
- Can we do this in the morning? - Wait wait.

31
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:12,395
- 照片就印在我们旅店的宣传册上
It's printed in our brochure.

32
00:02:12,432 --> 00:02:13,922
- 我们给你寄了一份没有？ - 呃，好像寄了
- Did we send you one of these? - Uh, probably did.

33
00:02:13,966 --> 00:02:16,662
- 你看到她了吗？就在窗户里 - 是的，看到了
- Do you see her in the window? - Yeah, there she is.

34
00:02:16,702 --> 00:02:19,694
这照片是位客人１９８６年拍摄到的
That's a photo that a guest took in 1986.

35
00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:21,707
你们信上说…
In your letter you mentioned that the rooms

36
00:02:21,741 --> 00:02:23,709
…灵异现象多发生在…
with the most paranormal activity

37
00:02:23,743 --> 00:02:25,768
…顶楼的房间？ 能不能给我安排那儿的房间？
were in the attic. Could I have one of those rooms?

38
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:28,280
您说的没错 因为３楼就是顶楼
That's right, because the attic is on the third floor

39
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:30,441
以前是仆人的房间
which is the former servant's quarters.

40
00:02:30,483 --> 00:02:32,917
人们说西维亚的孩子…
People say that all of Sylvia's children

41
00:02:32,952 --> 00:02:35,819
…都因肺结核而死在上面
died up there of tuberculosis.

42
00:02:35,855 --> 00:02:38,688
- 所有的孩子？ - 客人们总是说听到奇怪的声音
- All of them? - Guests have reported strange sounds.

43
00:02:38,724 --> 00:02:41,318
午夜钟声后就总是有古怪的响声
At the stroke of midnight there's been weird noises.

44
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,988
对此我们的建议就是 最好从里面把门反锁上
Now our best advice is to lock your door from the inside.

45
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:45,691
- 是这样吧，亲爱的？ - 没错
- Isn't that right, honey? - That's right.

46
00:02:45,731 --> 00:02:48,291
一定要小心 从里面把门反锁上
You take care, you just lock it from the inside.

47
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:50,063
我会的
I will.

48
00:02:50,102 --> 00:02:51,933
只要你们给我钥匙
As soon as you give me the key.

49
00:02:53,372 --> 00:02:55,101
(laughs)

50
00:02:55,141 --> 00:02:57,507
哈，抱歉 马上给您拿来
I'm so... right. Got it right here.

51
00:02:57,543 --> 00:03:00,444
- １４号房，很好认的 - 今天可是长途跋涉啊
- Number 14, you can't miss it. - Been a long drive.

52
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,448
- 祝你好运 - 好的，看看今晚…
- Good luck. - All right, we'll see

53
00:03:02,482 --> 00:03:04,609
…能有什么诡异之事
what the night brings.

54
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:07,551
(thunder rumbling)

55
00:03:19,165 --> 00:03:21,156

(bottles clank)

57
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:17,052
旅店主人克拉克夫人
(birds chirping)

58
00:04:17,089 --> 00:04:18,283
从她接手旅店后
Mike: Mrs. Clark, the proprietor,

59
00:04:18,324 --> 00:04:19,985
says she hasn't slept a night

60
00:04:20,026 --> 00:04:22,859
她就没睡过觉 我相信她
since acquiring the inn and I believe her.

61
00:04:22,895 --> 00:04:25,227
不，不，我可怜她
No no no, I pity her.

62
00:04:25,264 --> 00:04:27,926
但是他们的荷包蛋土司太好吃了
But in any case, the eggs Benedict are delicious

63
00:04:27,967 --> 00:04:30,094
如果你提前电话预约 克拉克夫人说…
and if you call in advance, Mrs. Clark says

64
00:04:30,136 --> 00:04:33,697
…她还会烤制最拿手的巧克力蛋糕
she will bake her famous flourless chocolate cake.

65
00:04:33,739 --> 00:04:37,732
就恐怖指数而言 我给垂榉旅馆６颗骷髅头
On a Shiver Scale, I award the Weeping Beach Inn six skulls.

66
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,872
见鬼去吧，５颗骷髅头
Screw 'em, five skulls.

67
00:04:42,915 --> 00:04:44,405
(truck horn blares)

68
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:46,543
["10座闹鬼旅馆"]

00:04:54,827 --> 00:04:57,125
- 嗨 - 嗨

70

- 签名售书 - 哦，是这样啊
- Book signing. - Oh, right.

76
00:05:11,377 --> 00:05:14,835
对啊，那人就是你 和照片上还挺象的
Oh, that's you, yeah. I see the resemblance, yeah.

77
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,939
- 照片照的不错 - 多谢夸奖

78
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:18,541

88

总之，写作令我乐在其中
Mike: Anyway, so I really enjoyed writing it,

89
00:05:46,112 --> 00:05:48,046
这些作品本身也是在讲述历史
and that's kind of a history of the book.

90
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:51,174
希望你们都能喜欢
And I hope you enjoy it, or enjoyed it.

91
00:05:51,217 --> 00:05:53,708
永远保持恐惧
Uh, you know, stay scared.

92
00:05:53,753 --> 00:05:55,152
有什么问题吗？
Right? Any questions?

93
00:05:55,187 --> 00:05:57,485
你去过的最恐怖的地方是哪儿？
Where's the scariest place you've ever been?

94
00:05:57,523 --> 00:05:59,650
我去过的最恐怖的地方？
Scariest place I've ever been?

95
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:01,683
这问题以前还真没人问过我
Uh, I've never heard that question before.

96
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:03,922
我开玩笑的
- That's a joke. - (chuckles)

97
00:06:03,963 --> 00:06:06,295
每个地方都有自己鲜明的特点
Well, all these places have very colorful histories.

98
00:06:06,332 --> 00:06:07,890
Um...

99
00:06:07,933 --> 00:06:10,026
如果真要叫我选个最恐怖的
I would say, if I had to pick a top one,

100
00:06:10,069 --> 00:06:12,060
我想应该是 巴尔海港吧
I would say Bar Harbor,

101
00:06:12,104 --> 00:06:15,130
恐怖的麦德新婚之夜 谋杀案的案发现场
the site of the grisly McTeig wedding night murders.

102
00:06:15,174 --> 00:06:17,870
那儿真是个恐怖的地方 或者是圣・克劳德，明尼苏达
That's an intense place. Or maybe St. Cloud, Minnesota,

103
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:20,811
在那里，那些在战争中失去丈夫的寡妇 失去理智的把婴儿扔到井里
where the crazed war widow threw her baby down a well.

104
00:06:20,846 --> 00:06:23,178
那些地方 都弥漫着恐怖的气息
I mean, those all have a lot of... I mean, it's thick.

105
00:06:23,215 --> 00:06:26,013
- 很浓的气息 - 那些搞恶作剧的鬼呢？
- The air is thick. - What about poltergeists?

106
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:28,919
我是个专业的研究者 我每到一处都是装备精良
Look, I'm a good researcher. I go into every gig locked and loaded.

107
00:06:28,954 --> 00:06:32,185
我带着电磁辐射仪 全波光谱仪
I travel with an EMF meter, full-range spectrometer,

108
00:06:32,224 --> 00:06:34,920
红外照相机，我最大的乐趣…
infrared camera. I mean, look, nothing would make me happier

109
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,894
…就是去检验那些异灵事件
than to experience a paranormal event,

110
00:06:36,929 --> 00:06:39,659
就如同黑暗中瞥见
you know, to get a glimpse of the elusive light

111
00:06:39,699 --> 00:06:41,064
一缕神光般欣喜若狂
at the end of the tunnel.

112
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:42,931
(thunder crashes)

113
00:06:42,968 --> 00:06:45,266
你是说根本就不存在什么鬼魂？
So you're saying there's no such thing as ghosts?

114
00:06:46,405 --> 00:06:48,066
我是说目前为止我还没见过
I'm saying I've never seen one,

115
00:06:48,107 --> 00:06:50,473
但是对那些生意惨淡的旅店来说
but they're awful convenient for desperate hotels

116
00:06:50,509 --> 00:06:52,704
这些传闻却无疑会给他们带来生意
- when the interstate moves away. - (knocking)

117
00:06:52,745 --> 00:06:55,441
扯的太远了，谁有笔？
This thing has really gone off the rails. Who has a pen?

118
00:06:55,481 --> 00:06:58,041
- 我有 - 要签在哪本书上？
- I do. - Which one?

119
00:06:58,084 --> 00:07:01,315
说真的，麦克 要想见真正的鬼魂
Uh, but seriously, Mike, if I want to see a real live ghost,

120
00:07:01,353 --> 00:07:03,116
最好去什么地方？
where's my best bet?

121
00:07:03,155 --> 00:07:04,452
- 一定要看到？ - 恩
- Guaranteed? - Yeah.

122
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:06,048
奥兰多的闹鬼公寓
Haunted Mansion, Orlando.

123
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:08,287
太棒了，多谢
Awesome, thanks.

124
00:07:09,295 --> 00:07:10,887
- 时刻保持恐惧 - 谢谢
- Stay scared. - Thank you.

125
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:12,761
雷，你晚上锁门，好吗？
Cashier: Hey, Ray, can you lock up?

126
00:07:12,798 --> 00:07:15,733
我今晚要去乐队训练
I got band practice tonight.

127
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:17,395
天啊
Holy shit.

128
00:07:17,436 --> 00:07:18,926
这书你是从哪儿找到的？

129
00:07:17,436 --> 00:07:18,926
［漫漫回家路 作者：麦克・安斯林］

130
00:07:18,971 --> 00:07:20,996
- 易趣网 - 易趣？
- Um, eBay. - EBay, huh?

131
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:23,065
你多少钱买的？
- (girl laughs) - How much did it go for?

132
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:25,634
没多少人竞买
Well, there weren't many bidders.

133
00:07:25,678 --> 00:07:28,112
大概一个都没吧
I would think not.

134
00:07:28,147 --> 00:07:31,116
- 哇 - 这是本…
- Wow. - But it's, um...

135
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:32,879
- …很出色的书 - 噢

00:15:43,308 --> 00:15:45,299
请稍等，安斯林先生
It'll just be a minute, Mr. Enslin.

273
00:15:45,344 --> 00:15:47,039
(baby crying)

274
00:15:50,382 --> 00:15:52,714
晚上好，先生 我来帮你拿行李吧？
Good evening, sir. Can I help you with your bag?

275
00:15:52,751 --> 00:15:55,219
- 不用了 - 那好吧
- No. - Very well.

276
00:15:57,122 --> 00:15:59,784
安斯林先生，我是盖瑞德・奥林
Mr. Enslin, I'm Gerald Olin,

277
00:15:59,825 --> 00:16:01,588
海豚酒店的经理
manager of the Dolphin.

278
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:04,562
在酒店期间，您的任何要求…
If there's anything that I can do for you while you're here...

279
00:16:04,596 --> 00:16:06,860
无论是预定晚餐，还是演出门票
dinner reservations, theater tickets,

280
00:16:06,898 --> 00:16:08,627
甚至是尼克斯队比赛门票 都没问题，什么要求都行
maybe a Knicks game? Anything...

281
00:16:08,667 --> 00:16:10,658
只要您开口 我竭诚为您服务
just tell me. I am at your service.

282
00:16:10,702 --> 00:16:13,830
只要给我１４０８房的钥匙 就不会再给你添麻烦了
Well, if I can just get the key to 1408, I can get out of your hair.

283
00:16:13,872 --> 00:16:17,603
我们正打算为您升级到楼顶套房
Oh, we were thinking of upgrading you to a penthouse suite.

284
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:20,168
我只要１４０８房
1408, please.

285
00:16:20,212 --> 00:16:22,339
这么坚持？
Insistent, aren't we?

286
00:16:22,381 --> 00:16:24,246
您能不能到我办公室来…
Could you please humor me

287
00:16:24,283 --> 00:16:28,276
…我们私下好好聊聊呢？
by coming to my office for a more private conversation?

288
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,720
- 没问题 - 好极了
- Sure. - Excellent.

289
00:16:34,826 --> 00:16:37,260
请进，别客气
Come in. Make yourself comfortable.

290
00:16:38,997 --> 00:16:40,828
１４０８房里允许吸烟吗？
1408 a smoking room?

291
00:16:40,866 --> 00:16:43,164
事实上，倒是的
As a matter of fact, it is. Yes.

292
00:16:43,201 --> 00:16:46,602
很好，那晚上守夜时 可以少一点麻烦了
Good, one less worry in the watches of the night.

293
00:16:46,638 --> 00:16:48,572
来根雪茄吗？
Care for a cigar?

294
00:16:48,607 --> 00:16:50,734
不，谢了，我不抽烟
No thank you, I don't smoke.

295
00:16:50,776 --> 00:16:52,539
哦，这个，这个是…
Oh this, yeah. That's...

296
00:16:52,577 --> 00:16:55,011
只是为了防止核战爆发
in case nuclear war breaks out.

297
00:16:55,047 --> 00:16:56,207
我很早就戒烟了
I gave it up a long time ago.

298
00:16:56,248 --> 00:16:58,113
现在这样一半是因为习惯 一半是迷信
It's part habit, part superstition.

299
00:16:58,150 --> 00:16:59,515
这是作家的通病
It's, you know, a writer thing.

300
00:16:59,551 --> 00:17:01,314
那你一定喝酒吧？
You do drink, don't you?

301
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:03,116
当然了，我刚说我是作家
Of course, I just said I was a writer.

302
00:17:03,155 --> 00:17:06,454
１９３９年产的拉斯科威士忌
Le Cinquante Sept Deces, 1939.

303
00:17:06,491 --> 00:17:08,288
这可是上品
Exquisite.

304
00:17:08,327 --> 00:17:10,522
如果你能买得到的话 大概是８００美元一瓶
About $800 a bottle, when you can find it.

305
00:17:10,562 --> 00:17:13,429
多谢你的贿赂 可我只想住在１４０８房
I appreciate the bribe, but I intend on staying in that room.

306
00:17:14,733 --> 00:17:16,792
- 住多久？ - 多久？
- How long? - How long?

307
00:17:17,803 --> 00:17:19,430
通常情况下，我都是过夜
My usual is overnight.

308
00:17:19,471 --> 00:17:21,439
我明白了
I see.

309
00:17:21,473 --> 00:17:24,306
可从来没人在那房里捱过１小时
No one's ever lasted more than an hour.

310
00:17:24,343 --> 00:17:26,277
天啊，老兄
(laughs) Jesus, man.

311
00:17:26,311 --> 00:17:28,370
如果你是准备卖掉那狗屁的闹鬼房间
You ought to shave your eyebrows and paint your hair gold

312
00:17:28,413 --> 00:17:30,904
你应该把你的眉毛剃了 然后染一头金发
if you're gonna try to sell that spookhouse bullshit.

313
00:17:30,949 --> 00:17:32,382
否则你只能去吓吓小孩子
Otherwise, you'll scare the children.

314
00:17:32,417 --> 00:17:34,476
我正想方设法的帮你
Why are you mocking me when I am genuinely,

315
00:17:34,519 --> 00:17:36,714
你为什么却要嘲笑我呢？
to the best of my ability, trying to help you?

316
00:17:36,755 --> 00:17:38,484
不，你不过是在耍小把戏
No, you're playing a little game.

317
00:17:38,523 --> 00:17:40,753
你是在故作高深
You're selling the mystique.

318
00:17:40,792 --> 00:17:43,192
但是你我都清楚
But eventually, we both know

319
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:45,753
最后你还是会把钥匙给我 我还是会住进１４０８
you're gonna give me the key and I'm gonna go up to the room

320
00:17:45,797 --> 00:17:48,493
然后完成我的小说 而你的客房预定率也会随之上升五成
and I'm gonna write my story and your bookings are gonna go up 50%.

321
00:17:48,533 --> 00:17:51,866
你不介意这位＂小朋友＂ 记录我们的谈话吧？
Do you mind if my little friend records our conversation?

322
00:17:54,673 --> 00:17:56,072
那我当你答应了？
I'll take that as a yes.

323
00:17:56,108 --> 00:17:59,509
先生，你完全低估了我们酒店
Sir, you quite misunderstand the situation.

324
00:17:59,544 --> 00:18:02,843
我知道海豚酒店没有广场酒店…
Now, I know the Dolphin doesn't have the cachet of the Plaza

325
00:18:02,881 --> 00:18:04,576
…或者卡莱尔酒店那么有名
or the Carlyle,

326
00:18:04,616 --> 00:18:07,744
但是我们总是保持 ９０％的客房入住率
but we operate at 90% capacity.

327
00:18:07,786 --> 00:18:08,946
一直是
Always.

328
00:18:08,987 --> 00:18:11,649
我现在担心的不是酒店的前景
And my concern here is not for the hotel.

329
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:14,215
也不是你个人的安危
My concern here is not for you.

330
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:16,523
坦白的讲，或者自私一点说
Frankly, selfishly,

331
00:18:16,561 --> 00:18:19,530
我就是不想叫你入住１４０８房
I don't want you to check into 1408

332
00:18:19,564 --> 00:18:21,896
因为我不想去收拾你留下的烂摊子
because I don't want to clean up the mess.

333
00:18:21,933 --> 00:18:25,334
酒店经营重在自身形象
Now hotels are all about presentation

334
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:27,930
和提供良好的衣食住行服务
and fertile creature comforts.

335
00:18:27,973 --> 00:18:30,942
我学的是酒店管理
My training is as a manager,

336
00:18:30,976 --> 00:18:32,944
而不是验尸
not a coroner.

337
00:18:32,978 --> 00:18:36,277
我已经亲眼目睹了 ４起死亡事件…４起啊
Under my watch there have been four deaths... four.

338
00:18:36,314 --> 00:18:38,874
上次事件之后
After the last one, I forbade any guest

339
00:18:38,917 --> 00:18:41,181
我就禁止任何客人入住１４０８房
from checking into 1408 ever again.

340
00:18:41,219 --> 00:18:44,552
上次的死者叫大卫・海德 是个正牙医生，也是躁狂抑郁病患者
The last one was David Hide, orthodontist, manic-depressive.

341
00:18:44,589 --> 00:18:46,716
他割腕自杀 在那之前给自己做了手术
Slit his wrist, did a little self-surgery,

342
00:18:46,758 --> 00:18:48,225
把自己阉了，我说得对吧？
turned himself into a eunuch, right?

343
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:50,751
没错，看来你还是做过些调查的
Yes. So you've done your homework.

344
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:51,922
我好歹也是职业作家
I'm a professional too.

345
00:18:51,963 --> 00:18:54,864
不幸的是，酒店成立的这９５年来
Well, grievously, in its 95-year existence,

346
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:57,300
已经发生过７起跳楼自杀
the hotel has seen seven jumpers,

347
00:18:57,335 --> 00:18:59,360
４起服药过量死亡 ５起上吊
four overdoses, five hangings,

348
00:18:59,404 --> 00:19:00,632
- ３起自残身亡… - ３起自残身亡…
- three mutilations... - Three mutilations...

349
00:19:00,672 --> 00:19:02,367
２起窒息死亡 盖瑞德・奥林总经理…
two stranglings. General manager Gerald Olin

350
00:19:02,407 --> 00:19:04,534
…很了解酒店历史上发生的悲剧
is well-versed in the hotel's tragic history,

351
00:19:04,576 --> 00:19:07,374
讲述这些死亡事件时，很冷淡 就如同会计…
dryly reciting the docket of carnage like a bookkeeper

352
00:19:07,412 --> 00:19:09,141
…谈论账目那般坦然自如
discussing his ledger.

353
00:19:09,181 --> 00:19:11,240
你以为自己很聪明，是吧？
Well, you think you're clever, don't you?

354
00:19:11,283 --> 00:19:12,614
我知道你的伎俩
I know the game.

355
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:14,050
在你的调查中
Well, during your investigation,

356
00:19:14,085 --> 00:19:16,576
有没有发现１４０８房曾发生过
did you discover the 22 natural deaths

357
00:19:16,621 --> 00:19:18,612
２２起自然死亡事件？
that have occurred in 1408?

358
00:19:20,392 --> 00:19:21,723
自然死亡
Natural deaths?

359
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:24,092
啊哈，不知道了吧
Ah, didn't find out about them

360
00:19:24,129 --> 00:19:27,656
这些事报纸可没兴趣报道
because the newspapers don't print anything about them.

361
00:19:27,699 --> 00:19:31,032
１４０８房总共发生过５６起死亡事件
Hmm. All told, there have been 56 deaths

362
00:19:31,069 --> 00:19:32,502
５６起？你耍我吧
in 1408.

363
00:19:32,537 --> 00:19:35,768
56? You're shitting me.

364
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:37,604
看来你一点都不清楚
You don't know anything.

365
00:19:37,642 --> 00:19:40,668
１４０８房死者的死因五花八门
The causes of death in 1408 range

366
00:19:40,712 --> 00:19:43,146
心脏病发作，中风 淹死…
from heart attack, stroke, drowning...

367
00:19:43,181 --> 00:19:45,877
- 淹死？ - 对，有位米勒先生
- Drowning? - Yes, one Mr. Grady Miller

368
00:19:45,917 --> 00:19:48,044
淹死在鸡汤里
drowned in his chicken soup.

369
00:19:48,086 --> 00:19:50,452
这可不容易！ 他是怎么办到的？
That's hard to do. How... how did he do that?

370
00:19:50,489 --> 00:19:52,081
真的想知道？
How indeed?

371
00:19:52,123 --> 00:19:55,115
有意思吧 所有的记录都在这里
Interesting. It's all in here.

372
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:58,527
我可以把这些资料给你 你也可以自由出入我办公室
I will let you have this and give you access to my office.

373
00:19:58,563 --> 00:20:00,895
你可以做记录 把这些都写到你书里去
You can take notes, put it all in your book.

374
00:20:00,932 --> 00:20:03,127
我只要求…
My only condition

375
00:20:03,168 --> 00:20:06,865
…你不再要求入住１４０８房
is that you do not stay in that room.

376
00:20:06,905 --> 00:20:09,601
你会让我看所有这些资料？
You'll let me look at all that stuff?

377
00:20:09,641 --> 00:20:11,632
恩
Hmm.

378
00:20:19,351 --> 00:20:22,320
我还没喝过那种酒
I never did get that drink.

379
00:20:27,092 --> 00:20:28,491
(corks pops)

380
00:20:40,939 --> 00:20:44,272
- 哇，味道真不错 - 拿去吧
- Oh, that is good. - Here, keep it.

381
00:20:44,309 --> 00:20:46,334
就算是酒店送你的礼物
Compliments of the house.

382
00:20:57,956 --> 00:20:59,651
- 我还是要住那 - 他妈的！
- I'm still staying. - Damn it to hell!

383
00:20:59,691 --> 00:21:01,591
抱歉
I'm sorry.

384
00:21:01,626 --> 00:21:04,686
好吧 给，好好看看这些吧
All right here. Here, read the godforsaken thing.

385
00:21:04,729 --> 00:21:06,822
我敢保证，读完之后
I guarantee you, once you've read it

386
00:21:06,865 --> 00:21:09,231
你肯定会改变主意不想住进１４０８
you won't want to stay in 1408.

387
00:21:11,202 --> 00:21:13,466
第一位受害者 凯文・O・麦里先生
The first victim: Mr. Kevin O'Malley,

388
00:21:13,505 --> 00:21:15,302
是位缝纫机推销员
sewing machine salesman.

389
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:17,205
于１９１２年１０月 酒店开业第一周入住…
Checked into the hotel the first week it opened...

390
00:21:17,242 --> 00:21:20,177
他割喉而亡，对吗？
- October, 1912. - Cut his own throat, right?

391
00:21:20,211 --> 00:21:21,769
那还不是最恐怖的
Oh, that's not the horrific part.

392
00:21:21,813 --> 00:21:23,838
之后，在流血身亡之前
Afterwards, in a fit of insanity,

393
00:21:23,882 --> 00:21:26,316
在近乎疯狂的状态下 他试图用老式的缝衣针…
he tried to stitch himself back together

394
00:21:26,351 --> 00:21:28,785
…把伤口再缝起来
using an old sewing needle before he bled to death.

395
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:30,515
放松点，老兄
Easy, man.

396
00:21:30,555 --> 00:21:33,547
听着，安斯林先生 你没必要住进１４０８房
Look, Mr. Enslin, you don't have to stay in 1408.

397
00:21:33,592 --> 00:21:35,617
你完全可以在１４０４房拍些照片
You can take photographs of 1404.

398
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:39,187
这２个房间布局完全一致 根本不会有人注意到有什么差别
It has the exact same layout and no one will ever know the difference.

399
00:21:39,230 --> 00:21:41,892
- 可我的读者们想了解事实 - 你的读者？
- My readers expect the truth. - Your readers?

400
00:21:41,933 --> 00:21:44,731
你的读者们不过是想看些 荒诞离奇…
Your readers expect grotesqueries

401
00:21:44,769 --> 00:21:46,930
…廉价刺激的情节罢了
and cheap thrills.

402
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:49,702
＂无头鬼云格・李斯比…
"The headless ghost of Mr. Eugene Rilsby

403
00:21:49,741 --> 00:21:51,504
…还是走进了废弃的农舍＂
still walks his abandoned farmhouse."

404
00:21:51,543 --> 00:21:54,979

"The Barking Phantom of Mount Hope Cemetery."

405
00:21:55,013 --> 00:21:56,742
这些都是书中原话… 你是怎么知道的？
A direct quote... how'd you know that?

406
00:21:56,781 --> 00:21:58,544
你的书并不难找
Your books aren't hard to find.

407
00:21:58,583 --> 00:22:00,448
每家书店的打折区都可以看到
They're on the bargain shelves

408
00:22:00,485 --> 00:22:03,215
of any paperback novel store;

409
00:22:03,254 --> 00:22:06,781
书中到处充斥着玩世不恭 而作者自称机敏过人，才华横溢
full of cynicism, written by a talented, intelligent man

410
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:09,487
是个相当自负的人
who doesn't believe in anything or anyone but himself.

411
00:22:09,527 --> 00:22:12,428
随你怎么说吧
Guilty as charged.

412
00:22:12,464 --> 00:22:15,262
我们没什么好谈的了 直接把房间钥匙给我吧
Hey listen, this meeting's over. Why don't you give me the room?

413
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:17,791
别这样，别像个 受了委屈的小丫头似的
Oh please, don't act like a hurt schoolgirl.

414
00:22:17,836 --> 00:22:20,896
- 说实话，你还挺让我吃惊的 - 是吗？
- In fact, you surprised me. - Oh.

415
00:22:20,939 --> 00:22:23,772
你并没有我想象的那么尖刻
You are not the hack-n-slash I expected.

416
00:22:23,808 --> 00:22:26,402
我真的挺喜欢你第一部小说 精装的那本
I rather liked the first one, the hardcover.

417
00:22:26,444 --> 00:22:30,141
叫什么名字来着 ＂最后的散步…＂
What was it called? "The Last Walk..."

418
00:22:30,181 --> 00:22:31,478
＂漫漫回家路＂
"Long Road Home."

419
00:22:31,516 --> 00:22:34,485
＂漫漫回家路＂，就是这本
"The Long Road Home," yes.

420
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:36,987
我想那名父亲是个混蛋
I rather thought the father was a bastard.

421
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:38,922
是的，他的确是
Yeah, he was.

422
00:22:38,957 --> 00:22:40,982
呃…
Um...

423
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:42,493
老兄，快把钥匙给我吧
Iook man, just give me the key.

424
00:22:42,527 --> 00:22:45,621
- 安斯林先生… - 快点给我钥匙！
- Mr. Enslin... - Just give me the key!

425
00:22:45,664 --> 00:22:48,690
听着,我在皮戈比家住过
Listen, I stayed at the Bigsby house.

426
00:22:48,733 --> 00:22:51,668
我还站在大卫・史密斯先生…
I brushed my goddamn teeth right next to the tub

427
00:22:51,703 --> 00:22:54,001
…淹死他一家老小的浴缸旁刷过牙
where Sir David Smith drowned his whole family.

428
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:57,008
我１２岁开始就不再怕吸血鬼了
And I stopped being afraid of vampires when I was 12.

429
00:22:57,042 --> 00:23:00,603
知道我为什么敢住你这 闹鬼的老屋吗，奥林先生？
Do you know why I can stay in your spooky old room, Mr. Olin?

430
00:23:00,645 --> 00:23:03,443
因为我知道鬼魂，幽灵
Because I know that ghoulies and ghosties

431
00:23:03,481 --> 00:23:05,779
这些东西根本就不存在
and long-legged beasties don't exist.

432
00:23:06,918 --> 00:23:08,408
即使他们真的存在…
Even if they did,

433
00:23:08,453 --> 00:23:11,047
也没有神灵可以 保护我们不受伤害，对吗？
there's no God to protect us from them, is there?

434
00:23:12,791 --> 00:23:14,782
我根本就不可能说服你，是吗？
So I can't talk you out of this?

435
00:23:14,826 --> 00:23:17,386
我想我们都彼此清楚
I think we've reached an understanding.

436
00:23:17,429 --> 00:23:19,863
那好吧
Very well.

437
00:23:19,898 --> 00:23:22,458
跟我来
Come with me.

438
00:23:27,439 --> 00:23:29,532
(jangles)

439
00:23:32,610 --> 00:23:34,271
(elevator dings)

440
00:23:34,312 --> 00:23:36,746
大多数酒店早就改成磁卡钥匙了
Most hotels have switched to magnetics.

441
00:23:36,781 --> 00:23:40,217
那房间居然还使用这么原始钥匙 手感很不错…古色古香的
An actual key. That's a nice touch... it's antiquey.

442
00:23:40,251 --> 00:23:43,812
我们有磁卡钥匙，但是 电子设备在１４０８房似乎不能工作
We have magnetic cards also, but electronics don't seem to work in 1408.

443
00:23:43,855 --> 00:23:45,720
希望你身上没有心脏起博器
Hope you don't have a pacemaker.

444
00:23:45,757 --> 00:23:48,726
总经理宣称房间里的幽灵干扰…
General manager claims that the phantom in room interferes...

445
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,853
我可从来没提过＂幽灵＂这词
I have never used the word "phantom."

446
00:23:50,895 --> 00:23:53,363
抱歉，那＂灵魂＂呢？ 或者＂妖怪＂？
Oh, I'm sorry. Spirit? Specter?

447
00:23:53,398 --> 00:23:54,922
不，你误会了
No, you misunderstand.

448
00:23:54,966 --> 00:23:57,230
１４０８房不会有这些东西的
Whatever's in 1408 is nothing like that.

449
00:23:57,268 --> 00:24:00,066
那么是什么？
Then what is it?

450
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:02,539
就是间他妈的邪恶的房间
It's an evil fucking room.

451
00:24:04,476 --> 00:24:06,603
请上电梯吧
Please.

452
00:24:10,348 --> 00:24:13,943
奥林先生 能帮我签下字吗？
Mr. Odin. (speaks French)

453
00:24:13,985 --> 00:24:16,783
- 好的 - 谢谢
Oh, oui. Tres bien.

454
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:20,182
(classical music playing)

455
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:24,785
酒店老板为什么不关闭那房间呢？
Why don't the owners just close the room?

456
00:24:26,464 --> 00:24:28,932
酒店的领导层更希望装做 一切都不曾发生过
The Yasuko Corporation prefers to pretend there's no problem.

457
00:24:28,967 --> 00:24:31,959
就好像假装没有１３楼一样
Just as they pretend there's no 13th floor.

458
00:24:33,605 --> 00:24:35,573
那房间一定很脏吧？
The room, it's got to be filthy.

459
00:24:35,607 --> 00:24:37,802
床单应该有…１１年没换洗过了吧？
I mean, the sheets haven't been changed in what? 11 years?

460
00:24:37,842 --> 00:24:40,777
不，不， 我们酒店可专业呢
No no no, we're very professional.

461
00:24:40,812 --> 00:24:44,248
我们每个月都会简单打扫下１４０８房
1408 gets a light turn once a month.

462
00:24:44,282 --> 00:24:46,512
由我亲自监督 ２名清洁女工结伴打扫的
I supervise, the maids work in pairs.

463
00:24:46,551 --> 00:24:49,315
每次打扫房间 都像是打扫充满毒气的毒气室一样
We treat the room as if it's a chamber

464
00:24:49,354 --> 00:24:50,878
filled with poison gas.

465
00:24:50,922 --> 00:24:54,619
打扫不会超过１０分钟 而且我坚持一定要把房门打开
We only stay 10 minutes and I insist the door remain open.

466
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:57,025
可还是…
But still...

467
00:24:59,330 --> 00:25:01,958
几年前，一个萨尔瓦多藉的年轻女工
A few years ago, a young maid from El Salvador

468
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,558
被锁在卫生间里
found herself locked in the bathroom.

469
00:25:03,601 --> 00:25:04,829
虽然时间不长
She was only there for a few moments,

470
00:25:04,869 --> 00:25:06,860
但是当她出来时，她…
but when we pulled her out, she was...

471
00:25:06,905 --> 00:25:09,635
- 死了？ - 错，是瞎了
- She was dead. - No, blind.

472
00:25:09,674 --> 00:25:11,869
她用剪子…
She had taken a pair of scissors

473
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:13,878
…把自己的眼珠挖了出来
and gouged her eyes out.

474
00:25:13,912 --> 00:25:16,278
而且还歇斯底里的不停狂笑
- She was laughing hysterically. - (bell rings)

475
00:25:16,314 --> 00:25:18,612
我们到了
- Ouch. - Your floor.

476
00:25:19,784 --> 00:25:21,411
我只能陪你到这里
Well, this is where we part company.

477
00:25:21,452 --> 00:25:24,683
除非每个月打扫房间
This is as close as I get to 1408

478
00:25:24,722 --> 00:25:26,781
否则我不愿靠近１４０８房半步
unless it's that time of the month.

479
00:25:28,693 --> 00:25:31,423
- 那就明天见了 - 安斯林先生？
- See you tomorrow. - Mr. Enslin?

480
00:25:31,462 --> 00:25:33,430
求你…
Please...

481
00:25:33,464 --> 00:25:35,432
…别进去
don't do this.

482
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:40,638
我会来电话联系你 尼克斯队比赛门票的事
I'll call you about those Knicks tickets.

Okay. It's okay, sweetie. We're home now.

00:27:13,831 --> 00:27:14,923

00:28:19,731 --> 00:28:21,858
就这样？
This is it?

497
00:28:22,867 --> 00:28:25,529
开玩笑吧？
You got to be kidding me.

不得不承认 我差点就被他的阵势给唬住
I have to admit, he had me going for a moment.

500
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:52,293
但是那令人毛骨悚然的 恐怖场面在哪？
But where is the bone-chilling terror?

501
00:28:52,330 --> 00:28:55,094
血流成河的场景在哪儿呢？
Show me the rivers of blood.

502

奥林说酒店经营在于 良好的服务
Mike's voice: Olin said hotels are about fertile creature comforts.

511
00:29:57,428 --> 00:29:59,726
这话说的漂亮 但是我怀疑…
It's a good line, but I wonder

512
00:29:59,764 --> 00:30:02,562
…他指的究竟是不是 眼前的这些…
whether they're really about reassuring platitudes,

513
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:05,091
…我所熟悉的摆设
a prosaic sense of the familiar.

514

没错，这地方我以前来过

这里很安全
It's safe."

516
00:30:11,709 --> 00:30:14,200
这里有沙发
There's a sofa,

517
00:30:14,245 --> 00:30:17,737
写字台 古董衣柜
a writing desk, a faux antique armoire,

带小花图案的墙纸
floral wallpaper.

519
00:30:19,951 --> 00:30:22,317
极其普通的地毯，唯一引人注目人的 就是上面那一大块污渍
Carpet's unremarkable, except for a stain

520
00:30:22,353 --> 00:30:25,550
污渍正上方的墙上挂着幅油画 画的是暴风雨中迷航的帆船
beneath a thrift-store painting of a schooner lost at sea.

521
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:28,889
从作品阴暗的风格上看
The work is done in the predictably dull fashion

522
00:30:28,926 --> 00:30:30,791
极有可能是出自 柯里尔＆埃福斯印刷出版社
of Currier & lves.

523
00:30:30,828 --> 00:30:33,319
第二幅画画的是一位老妇人

526
00:30:37,435 --> 00:30:41,132
就像另一幅 圣母玛利亚和孩子的画像
as another Madonna and child watch from the background.

527
00:30:41,172 --> 00:30:44,835
确实有点危险的味道
It does have the vague air of menace.

528
00:30:44,876 --> 00:30:48,937
最后一幅画极其呆板无趣
The third and final painfully dull painting

529
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:50,971
画的是曾经风靡一时的＂打猎＂
is the ever-popular "The Hunt."

530
00:30:51,015 --> 00:30:53,643
马，猎犬和阴郁的英国贵族
Horses, hounds and constipated British lords.

531
00:30:53,684 --> 00:30:56,744
有些人说过平庸之恶
Some smartass spoke about the banality of evil.

532
00:30:56,787 --> 00:30:58,846
如果这个说法是对的
If that's true,

533
00:30:58,890 --> 00:31:01,654
那我们就生活在地狱的第７层
then we're in the seventh circle of Hell.

534
00:31:04,662 --> 00:31:07,096

538
00:31:20,411 --> 00:31:23,676
街上车水马龙 一片…的景象
Honking traffic below. The view of a...

539
00:31:23,714 --> 00:31:27,081
- Radio: # We've only just begun... # - Ow!

540
00:31:27,118 --> 00:31:31,248
妈的
- # To live... # - Holy shit.

541
00:31:31,289 --> 00:31:35,589
# White lace and promises #

542
00:31:37,061 --> 00:31:41,964
# A kiss for luck and we're on our way #

543
00:31:41,999 --> 00:31:45,491
# We've only begun #

544
00:31:45,536 --> 00:31:48,835
# Before the rising sun... #

545
00:31:48,873 --> 00:31:51,842
干得好，奥林 真吓人啊
Bravo, Olin. That is very unsettling.

546
00:31:53,444 --> 00:31:58,746
# So many roads to choose #

547
00:31:58,783 --> 00:32:04,415
# We start off walking and learn to run #

548
00:32:04,455 --> 00:32:06,389
# And yet we've just begun... #

549
00:32:06,424 --> 00:32:08,688
也就是说，房里有人
That means someone's in the room.

550
00:32:11,929 --> 00:32:15,194
有人吗？
Hello?

551
00:32:15,233 --> 00:32:16,393
有人吗？
Hello!

552
00:32:19,971 --> 00:32:21,097
Whoa.

553
00:32:25,743 --> 00:32:27,176
这可奇怪了
That is bizarre.

554
00:32:29,347 --> 00:32:31,144
(turns off radio)

555
00:32:31,182 --> 00:32:33,616
我终于有东西可写了
Finally I got something to write about.

556
00:32:33,651 --> 00:32:36,119
来给我打扫房间的鬼魂
A ghost that offers turn-down service.

557
00:32:36,153 --> 00:32:37,848
(chuckles)

558
00:32:39,557 --> 00:32:41,320
好吧
All right.

559
00:32:41,359 --> 00:32:44,192
好吧 现在就来找出这个混蛋
All right, let's Encyclopedia Brown this bitch.

560
00:32:44,228 --> 00:32:46,196
我开始正在看窗外
Started off the window,

561
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:48,255
听到音乐后 马上回过头来
hear the music, nab my head.

562
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:50,767
接着转身到床边 拿了巧克力
I turn around, go to the bed for the chocolate.

563
00:32:50,801 --> 00:32:52,769
之后我去了壁橱那
Then I go into the closet which would have...

564
00:32:52,803 --> 00:32:54,794
背朝着那边
my back was turned. It would have let

565
00:32:54,839 --> 00:32:58,206
所以说他有足够的时间 跑回来在手纸上做手脚
Houdini have time to come in here do the paper trick...

566
00:32:58,242 --> 00:33:00,870
他现在应该在客厅！
and he's in the living room.

567
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,421
出来！
Out!

568
00:33:23,334 --> 00:33:24,801
Huh.

569
00:33:29,707 --> 00:33:31,402
(air blowing)

570
00:33:31,442 --> 00:33:33,171
有人吗？
Hello?

571
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:45,550
你还得再使把劲，混蛋！
You're gonna have to try harder, asshole!

572
00:33:45,589 --> 00:33:47,614
你那上面很暖和吧
Nice and warm for you up there?

573
00:33:47,658 --> 00:33:49,319
下面可热坏了
It's hot down here, bubba.

574
00:33:58,669 --> 00:34:00,330
快工作啊
Come on.

575
00:34:13,050 --> 00:34:15,348
(ringing)

576
00:34:15,386 --> 00:34:17,752
- 这里是前台 - 嗨，我是麦克・安斯林
- Woman: Front desk. - Hello, this is Mike Enslin.

577
00:34:17,788 --> 00:34:20,086
- 你应该知道我住哪间房吧？ - 晚上好，先生
- Guess which room. - Good evening, sir.

578
00:34:20,124 --> 00:34:22,115
- 晚上好 - 你是打算退房吗？
- Good evening. - Are you ready to check out?

579
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:24,024
退房？不，当然不是
Check out? No no no no no.

580
00:34:24,061 --> 00:34:25,858
退房，不，我为什么要退房呢？
Check out, check out, no. Why would I check out?

581
00:34:25,896 --> 00:34:29,332
特别是你们还提供这么优秀的服务 考虑太周到了
Especially with this wonderful maid service. It's so discreet.

582
00:34:29,367 --> 00:34:31,961
不，不，我是要你们派人来修下自动调温器
No no no, I need you to send somebody to fix my thermostat.

583
00:34:32,002 --> 00:34:34,266
- 房间热的都喘不过气来 - 好的，先生
- Room's on fire. - Of course, sir.

584
00:34:34,305 --> 00:34:35,863
我们马上派修理工上来
We'll send an engineer right up.

585
00:34:35,906 --> 00:34:38,374
- 真的吗？ - 当然了
- You will? - Absolutely.

586
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:40,172
- 谢谢 - 不客气
- Thank you. - You're welcome.

587
00:34:48,052 --> 00:34:50,213
(baby crying)

588
00:34:51,789 --> 00:34:53,654
(woman humming)

589
00:35:22,286 --> 00:35:24,720
我们一起经历过…
How many thin walls

590
00:35:24,755 --> 00:35:26,950
…多少惊险…
have we put up with together,

591
00:35:26,991 --> 00:35:28,982
…我的老伙计？
old boy?

592
00:35:29,994 --> 00:35:32,827
走访过多少墓地？
How many sarcophagal chambers?

593
00:35:36,567 --> 00:35:38,797
旅馆房间本身就是 让人起鸡皮疙瘩的地方…
Hotel rooms are a naturally creepy place...

594
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:41,362
…是不是？
don't you think?

595
00:35:41,405 --> 00:35:43,737
在你之前，不知道 有多少人睡过这张床？
I mean, how many people have slept in that bed before you?

596
00:35:43,774 --> 00:35:45,366
他们中有多少人患病？
How many of them were sick?

597
00:35:45,409 --> 00:35:47,639
多少人失去理智？
How many of them lost their minds?

598
00:35:49,847 --> 00:35:53,044
又有多少人…已经逝去？
How many of them... died?

599
00:35:55,019 --> 00:35:57,283
我们为了这故事而来
We came here to get the story,

600
00:35:57,321 --> 00:36:00,188
所以我们不能慌，对吗？
and we don't rattle, do we?

601
00:36:04,628 --> 00:36:05,890
(shutter clicking)

602
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:11,491
(sloshes)

603
00:36:40,030 --> 00:36:42,624
(creaking)

604
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:28,811
这不是我真实所见 不是真实的
It's not that what I'm seeing is not real.

605
00:37:28,846 --> 00:37:31,110
绝对不是真实的
It just ain't as real as it seems.

606
00:37:31,148 --> 00:37:34,447
(wind howling, waves crashing)

607
00:37:35,519 --> 00:37:37,350
谁啊？
- (bangs on door) - Hello?

608
00:37:37,388 --> 00:37:39,948
是您房间的温控出问题了吗？
Man: You got a problem with the temperature?

609
00:37:45,896 --> 00:37:47,193
没错
Yeah.

610
00:37:52,236 --> 00:37:53,760
倒是开啊
Come on.

611
00:37:57,408 --> 00:37:59,137
温度是太高还是太低？
Is it too hot or too cold?

612
00:37:59,176 --> 00:38:01,076
我这副样子，你觉得呢？
What does it look like?

613
00:38:01,111 --> 00:38:03,204
进来吧
Come on in.

614
00:38:03,247 --> 00:38:05,112
温控箱在这儿
The box is right over here.

615
00:38:05,149 --> 00:38:06,673
卡在８０动不了了
It's stuck around 80.

616
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:11,879
温控箱在这里
I said the box is right here.

617
00:38:11,922 --> 00:38:14,516
我当然知道它在哪儿 不过我不会踏进这屋半步
I know where the hell it is, but I ain't going in this room.

618
00:38:15,893 --> 00:38:18,384
你只要再走几步就好了
You just have to walk six or seven feet.

619
00:38:18,429 --> 00:38:20,920
我说了不进去 你知道这屋出过什么事吗？
I said I ain't going in. You know what happened in here?

620
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:22,193
是的，我都清楚
Yes, I'm well aware of that.

621
00:38:22,232 --> 00:38:24,097
好吧，我告诉你怎么修
Look, I'll talk you through it.

622
00:38:24,134 --> 00:38:26,261
很容易的，傻子都能修好
Any jackass can fix that thing.

623
00:38:26,303 --> 00:38:28,168
把面板打开
Just remove the panel.

624
00:38:32,343 --> 00:38:34,971
好了，在线圈上面
Okay, now above that coil

625
00:38:35,012 --> 00:38:36,775
有个装着水银的管子
is a little tube filled with mercury.

626
00:38:36,814 --> 00:38:39,248
那是用来启动开关的
That's supposed to activate the contact switch.

627
00:38:39,283 --> 00:38:42,411
这酒店年代久远 很多设备都运转不灵了
But this hotel's so goddamn old, half the shit in here don't work.

628
00:38:42,453 --> 00:38:44,114
你只要轻轻敲两下那管子就好了
Just give the tube a little tap.

629
00:38:44,154 --> 00:38:45,746
敲啊！
Just tap the damn thing!

630
00:38:48,025 --> 00:38:49,788
啊，好了！
Yeah, there it is.

631
00:38:49,827 --> 00:38:52,261
先生，你真是天才！
Oh, sir, you're a genius.

632
00:38:52,296 --> 00:38:54,287
真是绅士，专家
A gentleman and a scholar.

633
00:38:54,331 --> 00:38:55,821
谢谢你 让我来…
Thank you. Let me give you...

634
00:38:56,900 --> 00:38:58,299
…给你点小费
a tip.

635
00:39:01,105 --> 00:39:02,663
先生？
Sir?

636
00:39:31,201 --> 00:39:35,035
Radio: # And yet we've just begun #

637
00:39:36,306 --> 00:39:38,774
(gags)

638
00:39:38,809 --> 00:39:41,141
# Sharing horizons... #

639
00:39:41,178 --> 00:39:43,112
婊子养的…
Son of a...

640
00:39:49,586 --> 00:39:52,578
(beeping)

641
00:40:04,568 --> 00:40:06,763
没人能捱过１小时
Nobody lasts more than an hour.

642
00:40:10,474 --> 00:40:12,442
效率还真高啊
Very effective.

643
00:40:13,911 --> 00:40:16,573
(high-pitched humming)

644
00:40:16,613 --> 00:40:19,912
(heart beating)

645
00:40:33,731 --> 00:40:35,756
(silent)

646
00:40:50,147 --> 00:40:51,614
(screams)

647
00:40:51,648 --> 00:40:53,548
靠！天啊！
Oh fuck! Jesus!

648
00:40:54,885 --> 00:40:56,477
天啊
Oh, God.

649
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:59,114
婊子养的…
Ow! Son of a...

650
00:41:15,973 --> 00:41:18,942
他妈的！
Ow! Fuck! Agh!

651
00:41:22,412 --> 00:41:24,607
天呐！
Ow! God!

652
00:41:38,328 --> 00:41:40,023
(sink gurgling)

653
00:41:46,370 --> 00:41:48,531
(groans)

654
00:41:53,410 --> 00:41:58,575
# We've only just begun #

655
00:41:58,615 --> 00:42:00,412
# To li... #

656
00:42:05,956 --> 00:42:07,480
(phone ringing)

657
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:12,890
喂？
- Hello? - (dial tone)

658
00:42:12,930 --> 00:42:15,330
(ringing continues)

659
00:42:16,967 --> 00:42:18,832
- 喂 - 先生
- Hello? - Woman: Sir, I'm afraid there was

660
00:42:18,869 --> 00:42:20,734
抱歉厨房搞错了
a miscommunication in the kitchen.

661
00:42:20,771 --> 00:42:22,932
您点的三明治 要晚１０分钟才能送过来
There's going to be a 10-minute delay with your sandwich.

662
00:42:22,973 --> 00:42:24,099
三明治？什么三明治？
Sandwich? What sandwich?

663
00:42:24,141 --> 00:42:26,006
我根本没点过？你说什么呢？
I didn't order any sandwich. What are you talking about?

664
00:42:26,043 --> 00:42:27,533
抱歉，你可以选择…
I'm sorry. You're welcome to substitute

665
00:42:27,578 --> 00:42:29,546
…别的配餐代替法式炸薯条
a side dish for your French fries.

666
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:31,605
我们有奶酪，通心粉沙拉…
We have cottage cheese, macaroni salad,

667
00:42:31,648 --> 00:42:33,582
- …凉拌卷心菜… - 听着，我认输行了吧
- coleslaw... - Listen to me. You win.

668
00:42:33,617 --> 00:42:35,551
我现在就退房，我受伤了
I'm checking out. I'm hurt.

669
00:42:35,586 --> 00:42:37,816
听到了吗？ 我的手受伤了
Do you understand? My goddamn hand is hurt.

670
00:42:37,855 --> 00:42:40,619
好的，如果您早上１０点前 把需要干洗的衣服准备好
I understand. If you leave your dry cleaning out by 10:00 AM,

671
00:42:40,657 --> 00:42:42,784
我们下午５点前 就能给您送回房间…
we'll have it pressed and returned by 5:00...

672
00:42:42,826 --> 00:42:45,124
操，婊子！叫辆出租 马上把我送到离这最近的医院去！
Shit, bitch! Call me a cab to the nearest hospital!

673
00:42:45,162 --> 00:42:48,097
我受伤了，你明白吗？
I'm hurt! Do you comprehend what I'm telling you?

674
00:42:48,131 --> 00:42:51,294
先生，我受不了 您用这种语气和我说话
Sir, I will not tolerate you speaking to me in that tone of voice.

675
00:42:51,335 --> 00:42:54,270
蠢货！我要起诉你们！
You're an idiot! I'm gonna sue your ass!

676
00:42:54,304 --> 00:42:56,738
我要采取法律手段 你们到底是搞什么？
I'm gonna take legal action! What's wrong with you?

677
00:42:56,773 --> 00:43:00,004
如果您需要，我可以帮您 转到酒店经理奥林先生那
If you wish, I can connect you with our manager Mr. Olin.

678
00:43:00,043 --> 00:43:02,170
好的，太好了！ 叫他接电话！
Good! Good good good good good! Put him on.

679
00:43:02,212 --> 00:43:04,407
叫他妈的马上接！
Put him on. I'm gonna blitz the son of a bitch.

680
00:43:04,448 --> 00:43:06,313
奥林！太好了！ 快转给他！
Olin... good! Put him on now!

681
00:43:06,350 --> 00:43:08,318
(Muzak playing)

682
00:43:08,352 --> 00:43:10,582
在海豚酒店，您可以在 位于中层楼的海鲷餐厅…
Man's voice: When staying at the Dolphin, be certain to enjoy

683
00:43:10,621 --> 00:43:13,556
…享受到纽约极品美味
New York's finest dining at the fabled Sea Bream restaurant

684
00:43:13,590 --> 00:43:15,751
肌肉紧张？
on our mezzanine level. Muscles tense?

685
00:43:15,792 --> 00:43:18,260
请致电并光临我们的温泉中心
Then make an appointment to visit our deluxe spa

686
00:43:18,295 --> 00:43:20,092
我们有按摩…
on the Coral level. With full massage,

687
00:43:20,130 --> 00:43:21,722

- it will leave you feeling relaxed... - Hello?

689
00:43:23,967 --> 00:43:26,959
…与活力 我们恭候您的致电…
And revitalized. Your call is important to us...

690
00:43:27,004 --> 00:43:28,733
混蛋！
- (dial tone) - You bitch.

691
00:43:29,740 --> 00:43:31,401
好，你们赢了！算你们狠！
You win. You win.

692
00:43:31,441 --> 00:43:33,636
好吧
All right. Okay!

693
00:43:35,679 --> 00:43:37,909
快开 快开啊！
Come on. Come on!

694
00:43:56,166 --> 00:43:57,793
快点，快点！
Come on. Come on.

695
00:43:58,802 --> 00:44:00,292
(lock clicks)

696
00:44:07,711 --> 00:44:09,269
Hey!

697
00:44:09,313 --> 00:44:11,110
Help! Help!

698
00:44:11,148 --> 00:44:13,275
(grunting)

699
00:44:23,894 --> 00:44:26,658
救命！救命！
Help! Help!

700
00:44:28,899 --> 00:44:30,628
有人听得到我吗？
Can anybody hear me?

701
00:44:30,667 --> 00:44:33,135
救命啊！
- Help! - (siren blaring)

702
00:44:34,304 --> 00:44:37,865
你！先生！ 先生！救命啊
You! Sir! Sir! Help!

703
00:44:39,776 --> 00:44:41,243
对！就是你！救救我！
Yeah! Yeah, you! Help!

704
00:44:41,278 --> 00:44:44,304
救救我！救救我！先生！
Help! Help! You, sir!

705
00:44:45,549 --> 00:44:48,177
看到我了吗？
Help! Can you see me?

706
00:44:48,218 --> 00:44:51,449
对！海豚酒店！
Yeah! The Dolphin Hotel!

707
00:44:51,488 --> 00:44:53,388
报警啊！
Call the police!

708
00:44:55,459 --> 00:44:57,120
救命啊！
Help!

709
00:45:00,163 --> 00:45:01,755
救命啊！
Help!

710
00:45:40,771 --> 00:45:42,568
嘿！ 小心！
Hey! Look out!

711
00:45:46,877 --> 00:45:48,868
(whimpering)

712
00:45:56,853 --> 00:45:58,582
(panting)

713
00:46:11,501 --> 00:46:13,901
嘿！
Hey!

714
00:46:30,887 --> 00:46:33,082
我一定是疯了
I'm losing my mind.

715
00:46:33,123 --> 00:46:34,750
我看到你了，爸爸
Girl's voice: I can see you, Dad.

716
00:46:34,791 --> 00:46:37,487
(gasps)

717
00:46:40,063 --> 00:46:42,930
爸，爸爸，你在哪里？
Daddy? Daddy, where are you?

718
00:46:44,968 --> 00:46:47,596
我来找你了
(giggles) I'm gonna get you.

719
00:46:48,638 --> 00:46:50,128
准备好了吗？
Ready or not,

720
00:46:50,173 --> 00:46:52,107
我来了
here I come.

721
00:46:53,477 --> 00:46:55,377
(panting)

722
00:46:58,949 --> 00:47:01,144
你在这儿啊
Here you are.

723
00:47:01,184 --> 00:47:04,017
我找到你了，爸爸
I see you, Daddy. (giggling)

724
00:47:06,223 --> 00:47:08,316
坚持住
Get ahold of yourself.

725
00:47:08,358 --> 00:47:10,622
这些都是幻觉
(whispering) You're running to places that aren't real.

726
00:47:10,660 --> 00:47:12,787
起来，快起来
Get up. Get up.

727
00:47:15,465 --> 00:47:17,023
你失去判断力了
You're losing the plot.

728
00:47:21,671 --> 00:47:24,504
你全都搞错了
You're losing the whole goddamn structure.

729
00:47:24,541 --> 00:47:27,908
爸爸！来找我吧
Girl: Daddy! Find me.

730
00:47:27,944 --> 00:47:30,913
可能是心理恐慌引起了心颤 而产生了幻觉
Psychokinetic fibrillations.

731
00:47:30,947 --> 00:47:34,178
这种环境下头脑不清醒的人 很容易受到心理暗示
A tired mind among classic haunted-house powers of suggestion.

732
00:47:34,217 --> 00:47:36,117
昏暗的灯光 褪色的地毯
Gaslit features, faded rugs,

733
00:47:36,153 --> 00:47:38,280
就像上次在堪萨斯汽车旅馆那样
like that motel in Kansas.

734
00:47:38,321 --> 00:47:41,017
一切都是可以解释的 仔细想下
There's a reason for everything. Just think.

735
00:47:43,793 --> 00:47:45,693
那是什么？
What's that?

736
00:47:46,730 --> 00:47:49,858
是什么？ 是监视镜头吗？
What is that? Is that a spycam?

737
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:53,427
你是不是看的很有意思？
Who is that? Are you enjoying this?

738
00:47:53,470 --> 00:47:56,371
是心理变态的酒店老板？ 难道是奥林？
Is that the sadistic owner of the hotel or is that Olin?

739
00:47:59,709 --> 00:48:01,609
等等
Wait a minute.

740
00:48:03,079 --> 00:48:04,944
他给了酒我喝
He gave me booze.

741
00:48:04,981 --> 00:48:07,643
他给过酒我喝 他自己好象没喝过？
He gave me booze. Did he take a sip?

742
00:48:08,952 --> 00:48:10,817
我不记得了
I can't remember. (sniffs)

743
00:48:13,089 --> 00:48:14,750
他给我下药了！
He dosed me!

744
00:48:14,791 --> 00:48:16,884
酒里可能下了药 巧克力里也可能有
It was the booze or the chocolates.

745
00:48:16,927 --> 00:48:18,895
不要随便接受陌生人给的糖果
Never take candy from strangers.

746
00:48:18,929 --> 00:48:21,625
好了，没事的 我只不过是被下药了
All right, all right. I'm just hallucinating.

747
00:48:21,665 --> 00:48:23,895
只是暂时的幻觉而已
I'm just hallucinating.

748
00:48:23,934 --> 00:48:25,367
我会没事的
I've just got to ride this out.

749
00:48:25,402 --> 00:48:26,869
会好的
I've got to ride this out

750
00:48:26,903 --> 00:48:29,394
几小时后药效一过，我就没事了
for four or five hours and I'm straight. Okay.

751
00:48:30,807 --> 00:48:32,172
你一定能挺过去
You can do this.

752
00:48:32,209 --> 00:48:32,375
(overlapping voices)

753
00:48:32,375 --> 00:48:33,899
(overlapping voices)

754
00:48:33,944 --> 00:48:35,673
我马上就抓住你了
Woman: Oh, man. I'm gonna get you.

755
00:48:35,712 --> 00:48:38,272
这下你完蛋了，过来 快过来！
You are finished. Come here. Come here!

756
00:48:38,315 --> 00:48:41,716
爸爸！坐下吧！
Dad! Sit down!

757
00:48:41,751 --> 00:48:43,343
想要我坐下吗？
Mike: You want me to sit down?

758
00:48:43,386 --> 00:48:44,876
(giggling)

759
00:48:44,921 --> 00:48:46,320
要我坐下吗？
Mike: You want me to sit down?

760
00:48:46,356 --> 00:48:47,948
- 当然了 - 好的，等下
- Yes! - Okay, hold on, hold on.

761
00:48:47,991 --> 00:48:49,515
镜头还没…
Let me find a good...

762
00:48:49,559 --> 00:48:51,220
镜头没对准你们
let me find a good frame here.

763
00:48:53,196 --> 00:48:54,959
女士们，先生们
Ladies and gentlemen,

764
00:48:54,998 --> 00:48:58,058
欢迎您收看选丑大赛
welcome to the Most Ugliest Person Competition.

765
00:48:59,236 --> 00:49:00,703
现在我宣布金鱼
Fifth and fourth place

766
00:49:00,737 --> 00:49:03,171
波利斯和多利斯分别排在 第５名和第４名
goes to Boris and Doris the goldfish.

767
00:49:03,206 --> 00:49:07,609
女士们，先生们！ 我们给他们来个特写
Ladies and gentlemen! Let's get a closeup of those guys.

768
00:49:07,644 --> 00:49:09,509
给Boris和Doris来个特写
Let's have a closeup of Boris and Doris.

769
00:49:09,546 --> 00:49:12,344
看看他们俩，真是够丑的
Look at that. Those are some ugly fish.

770
00:49:12,382 --> 00:49:14,748
这个奖对他们来说 真是名副其实啊
They're so ugly they're running from you.

771
00:49:14,784 --> 00:49:16,752
第三名是安斯林先生
Third place goes to Mike Enslin.

772
00:49:16,786 --> 00:49:18,515
哦，太让我吃惊了
- Surprise surprise. - (both giggle)

773
00:49:18,555 --> 00:49:21,615
好吧，这样够不够丑？
Right, how's this for ugly? (roars)

774
00:49:25,895 --> 00:49:28,363
大赛的亚军是莉莉・安斯林
Second place goes to Lily Enslin.

775
00:49:28,398 --> 00:49:31,526
真丑的扮相
- (roars) - That was good.

776
00:49:31,568 --> 00:49:35,129
有几分像贝奥武夫 遇到乡下人时的表情
That's kind of like Beowulf meets a redneck.

777
00:49:35,171 --> 00:49:39,369
- 我很喜欢 - 此次比赛的冠军就是凯蒂・安斯林
- I like it. - And first place goes to Katie Enslin.

778
00:49:41,645 --> 00:49:43,670
太可怕了，太…
That is a terror. That is...

779
00:49:43,713 --> 00:49:45,908
噢，天呐
oh, God! Don't show me that face!

780
00:49:45,949 --> 00:49:47,610
我都不想再看一遍了
Oh, I can't look at it again.

781
00:49:49,152 --> 00:49:51,245
求求你，不要转过来
Lily: Whatever you do, don't turn around.

782
00:49:51,288 --> 00:49:53,051
求求你，不要让我们看到你的丑相
Whatever you do, don't show us that face.

783
00:50:08,338 --> 00:50:10,431
(static crackling)

784
00:50:28,725 --> 00:50:30,124
(woman crying)

785
00:50:45,675 --> 00:50:47,438
(woman screaming)

786
00:50:47,477 --> 00:50:50,310
(baby crying)

787
00:51:01,491 --> 00:51:03,482
(light tapping)

788
00:51:03,526 --> 00:51:05,960
女士，能听到吗？
Ma'am, can you hear me?

789
00:51:09,165 --> 00:51:11,065
女士，帮帮我
Ma'am, I need your help.

790
00:51:12,235 --> 00:51:14,032
求您了，女士 听到我说话了吗？
Please, ma'am, can you hear me?

791
00:51:14,070 --> 00:51:16,300
(baby continues crying)

792
00:51:16,339 --> 00:51:19,137
孩子，安静点
- Kid, be quiet. - (baby wailing)

793
00:51:19,175 --> 00:51:21,075
行行好，女士
Please, ma'am.

794
00:51:21,111 --> 00:51:23,011
(crying intensifying, echoing)

795
00:51:23,046 --> 00:51:25,742
安静点！
Quiet! (groans)

796
00:51:38,795 --> 00:51:38,928
(crying stops)

797
00:51:38,928 --> 00:51:40,520
(crying stops)

798
00:51:40,563 --> 00:51:42,997
(groaning)

799
00:51:48,605 --> 00:51:50,869
(siren blaring in distance)

800
00:51:55,578 --> 00:51:57,546
(man crying)

801
00:52:18,868 --> 00:52:21,666
我希望
Man: I... wish...

802
00:52:22,672 --> 00:52:25,436
我…死了
I was dead.

803
00:52:28,711 --> 00:52:30,804
我的花园呢？
Where's my garden?

804
00:52:32,415 --> 00:52:35,145
我什么都闻不到
I can't smell anything.

805
00:52:35,185 --> 00:52:38,177
我讨厌这个地方
I hate this place.

806
00:52:43,326 --> 00:52:45,317
我是怎么到这儿的？
How did I get here?

807
00:52:49,399 --> 00:52:51,264
老爸
Pop.

808
00:52:51,301 --> 00:52:52,962
爸爸
Dad.

809
00:52:54,270 --> 00:52:55,999
我是麦克啊
It's Michael.

810
00:53:08,184 --> 00:53:10,618
我以前…
As you are...

811
00:53:10,653 --> 00:53:13,281
就象你现在这样
I was.

812
00:53:15,959 --> 00:53:18,052
你也会…
As I am...

813
00:53:21,331 --> 00:53:23,993
象我现在这样
you will be.

814
00:53:27,837 --> 00:53:31,295
(woman laughing)

815
00:53:31,341 --> 00:53:33,172
(panting)

816
00:53:45,355 --> 00:53:47,380
也许现在的我并不是真实的
Mike's voice: Maybe I'm not real.

817
00:53:49,826 --> 00:53:51,919
也许这不过是场恶梦
Maybe I'm just having a nightmare...

818
00:53:54,464 --> 00:53:56,728
一个极其逼真清晰的恶梦
an incredibly vivid

819
00:53:56,766 --> 00:53:59,200
lucid nightmare.

820
00:54:01,738 --> 00:54:04,298
我上次是睡觉是什么时候？
When is the last time I remember going to bed?

821
00:54:04,340 --> 00:54:06,604
(ticking)

822
00:54:06,643 --> 00:54:08,577
昨晚吗？
I flew in yesterday.

823
00:54:09,712 --> 00:54:13,011
还是…今天？我不记得了
Or was that... today?

824
00:54:14,017 --> 00:54:15,985
I can't remember.

825
00:54:16,019 --> 00:54:18,010
我是在火车上么？
Was I on a train?

826
00:54:21,558 --> 00:54:23,253
我醒了，之后吃了早饭
I woke up somewhere

827
00:54:23,293 --> 00:54:25,352
and I had breakfast.

828
00:54:25,395 --> 00:54:28,228
那是在哪里？我都吃了什么？
Where was I? What did I eat?

829
00:54:32,535 --> 00:54:34,526
(rumbling)

830
00:54:36,205 --> 00:54:37,695
又来了
Here it comes.

831
00:55:00,530 --> 00:55:03,693
人们都说在梦中 是死不了的，是真的吗？
They say you can't die in your dreams.

832
00:55:03,733 --> 00:55:05,257
Is that true?

833
00:55:14,477 --> 00:55:16,411
(rumbles)

834
00:55:22,485 --> 00:55:24,680
(horns blaring)

835
00:55:24,721 --> 00:55:28,213
吓一跳就会醒的
The shock would wake you up.

836
00:55:28,257 --> 00:55:30,191
(horn blaring)

837
00:55:32,795 --> 00:55:35,821
所以你不会真死
So you couldn't really die.

838
00:55:40,403 --> 00:55:42,268
好了，该怎么走？
All right, what are our options?

839
00:55:42,305 --> 00:55:45,763
到走廊，另一边是客房
Got the hallway, got guest rooms on either side,

840
00:55:45,808 --> 00:55:48,902
楼梯，紧急出口
stairwell, fire exits.

841
00:55:48,945 --> 00:55:50,708
这有另一扇窗
And that's the next window...

842
00:55:52,148 --> 00:55:53,638
在隔壁
the next room.

843
00:55:55,118 --> 00:55:58,576
离这里有多远？
How many feet across is that?

844
00:55:58,621 --> 00:56:00,282
One...

845
00:56:00,323 --> 00:56:02,188
(rumbles)

846
00:56:02,225 --> 00:56:03,817
...three,

847
00:56:03,860 --> 00:56:05,384
4，5
four, five,

848
00:56:05,428 --> 00:56:09,455
6，7，8
six, seven, eight...

849
00:56:09,499 --> 00:56:10,830
nine.

850
00:56:11,834 --> 00:56:14,735
9，9… 18英尺
Nine, nine... 18 feet across.

851
00:56:17,507 --> 00:56:20,635
好的，我能做到的
Okay. I can do this.

852
00:56:26,249 --> 00:56:29,150
要是出了事，万一我摔下去
If something should happen, if I should slip and fall,

853
00:56:29,185 --> 00:56:32,348
我希望大家知道 这不过是场意外
I want it to be known that it was an accident.

854
00:56:33,523 --> 00:56:35,457
而不是那房间赢了
The room...

855
00:56:35,491 --> 00:56:37,356
did not win.

856
00:56:38,895 --> 00:56:40,522
OK
Okay.

857
00:56:40,563 --> 00:56:42,428
好的，我能行的
Okay, I can do this.

858
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:45,599
小小的18步而已
18 little steps.

859
00:56:53,576 --> 00:56:55,544
4…
Four...

860
00:56:55,578 --> 00:56:57,978
别往下看，5…
Don't look down. Five...

861
00:56:59,248 --> 00:57:01,148
继续走
Keep moving.

862
00:57:05,555 --> 00:57:07,420
就这样
Here we go.

863
00:57:13,096 --> 00:57:15,792
好的，OK
All right. Okay.

864
00:57:15,832 --> 00:57:17,493
还有9…
Number nine...

865
00:57:17,533 --> 00:57:19,057
eight...

866
00:57:20,937 --> 00:57:22,302
six...

867
00:57:26,209 --> 00:57:28,677
窗口在哪儿呢？在哪？
Where is it? Where is it?

868
00:57:31,948 --> 00:57:35,247
(horns blaring)

869
00:57:38,087 --> 00:57:40,078
(gasping)

870
00:58:08,084 --> 00:58:09,574
(screams)

871
00:58:09,619 --> 00:58:11,951
(grunting)

872
00:58:18,327 --> 00:58:21,057
(sobbing)

873
00:58:27,170 --> 00:58:28,899
(screams)

874
00:58:49,525 --> 00:58:53,120
(groaning)

875
00:59:17,978 --> 00:59:19,678
[你的位置]

876
00:59:26,629 --> 00:59:28,256
(electricity buzzing)

877
00:59:33,870 --> 00:59:35,895
[烧死我]
(man screaming)

878
01:00:02,832 --> 01:00:05,562
(static)

879
01:00:05,601 --> 01:00:07,068
<i>冷静，你知道这些都是幻觉</i>
Get ahold of yourself.

880
01:00:07,103 --> 01:00:09,196
You're running to places that aren't real.

881
01:00:11,340 --> 01:00:13,001
(rewinding)

882
01:00:13,042 --> 01:00:15,203
<i>旅店房间本身就是恐怖之地</i>
Hotel rooms are naturally creepy places.

883
01:00:19,348 --> 01:00:22,146
<i>奇怪的是卧室居然没有窗户</i>
Strangely, the bedroom has no window.

884
01:00:22,184 --> 01:00:23,776
(groans)

885
01:00:23,819 --> 01:00:26,413
<i>奇怪的是卧室居然没有窗户</i>
(distorted) Strangely, the bedroom has no window...

886
01:00:26,455 --> 01:00:29,356
- (footsteps) - (door slams)

887
01:00:29,392 --> 01:00:31,758
爱德华医生，请到肿瘤科来
Woman: Dr. Edwards to Oncology.

888
01:00:34,397 --> 01:00:37,264
别这样
Lily: Please, please.

889
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:39,131
(sobbing)

890
01:00:43,873 --> 01:00:47,104
不，医生并不是万能的
No. No. Doctors don't know everything.

891
01:00:47,143 --> 01:00:49,111
我们再找新的设备，新的治疗方法
We can get another opinion, look for other treatment.

892
01:00:49,145 --> 01:00:51,511
- 你听说过的… - 看着我
- You hear about... - Look at me.

893
01:00:51,547 --> 01:00:53,071
- 奇迹痊愈 - 莉莉
...miracle cures. - Lily.

894
01:00:53,115 --> 01:00:56,380
不，上帝，帮帮我…
Oh God. Please, something.

895
01:00:56,419 --> 01:01:00,048
为什么上天忍心 让这么可爱的孩子得此重病？
Mike: What kind of god would do this to a little girl?

896
01:01:00,089 --> 01:01:03,024
(Lily sobbing)

897
01:01:07,897 --> 01:01:10,195
凯蒂
Katie.

898
01:01:10,232 --> 01:01:14,396
<i>我看不到你</i>
Katie: Daddy, I can't see you.

<i>爸爸，我找不到你</i>
Daddy, I can't find you.

01:01:17,640 --> 01:01:20,108
<i>爸，我好怕</i>
Daddy, I'm scared.

901
01:01:20,142 --> 01:01:22,667
<i>- 凯蒂 - 爸，我好怕</i>
- Katie. - I'm scared, Daddy.

902
01:01:22,712 --> 01:01:24,771
<i>救我</i>
Help.

903
01:01:24,814 --> 01:01:26,543
<i>救我</i>
Help me.

904
01:01:26,582 --> 01:01:28,447
<i>爸爸，快救我</i>
Daddy, help me.

905
01:02:02,353 --> 01:02:04,053
[无网络]

906
01:02:05,554 --> 01:02:07,419
我还有无线网络
Okay, how about the wireless?

907
01:02:07,456 --> 01:02:08,946
快啊
Come on.

908
01:02:16,298 --> 01:02:18,630
信号，找到信号
Give me a signal. Give me a signal.

909
01:02:18,667 --> 01:02:20,999
晚上好，麦克
- (beeps) - Computer: Good evening, Mike.

910
01:02:22,104 --> 01:02:23,571
太好了！
Oh, yes!

911
01:02:24,940 --> 01:02:28,706
麦克？
- (beeps) - Mike?

912
01:02:29,712 --> 01:02:31,373
麦克，是你吗？
Mike, is that... is that you?

913
01:02:31,414 --> 01:02:33,143
- 我看不清楚 - 是的，是我
- I can barely see you. - Yes yes.

914
01:02:33,182 --> 01:02:36,618
- 我是见鬼了吗？ - 不，是我，是麦克
- It's like seeing a ghost. - No no no. Yes, it's me.

915
01:02:36,652 --> 01:02:38,483
- 是我，是麦克 - 好奇怪啊
- It's me. It's Mike. - This is a little bizarre.

916
01:02:38,521 --> 01:02:40,648
我是说，一年没见到你了
I mean, I haven't talked to you in a year

917
01:02:40,689 --> 01:02:42,748
现在却以这种方式和你通话
and suddenly you pop up in a box on my computer.

918
01:02:42,792 --> 01:02:45,124
对不起，莉莉 请听我说
I'm sorry, Lily. Listen to me, please, quickly.

919
01:02:45,161 --> 01:02:47,755
我现在还在上班 你晚上打电话给我吧
Look, I'm at work, okay? So why don't you call me at home tonight?

920
01:02:47,797 --> 01:02:51,289
不，听着，我被困在了一间房间里
I'm trapped in this room, this place.

921
01:02:51,333 --> 01:02:53,528
麦克，你总是在奇怪的地方被困 你的工作就是这样
Mike, you're always trapped in weird places. That's your job.

922
01:02:53,569 --> 01:02:55,434
不是，求你，听我说
- No no, please, Lily. Listen to me. - (phone rings)

923
01:02:55,471 --> 01:02:57,302
- 求你了 - 莉莉・安斯林
- Please. - Lily Enslin.

924
01:02:57,339 --> 01:02:59,307
- 嗨，对，对 - 莉莉！
- Hi. Yeah yeah. - Lily!

925
01:02:59,341 --> 01:03:01,400
- 对，在我手上，我马上就下去 - 不！莉莉
- I've got those. I'll be right down. - No. Lily!

926
01:03:01,444 --> 01:03:03,742
莉莉，求你了！快报警！
Lily, please! Call the cops.

927
01:03:03,779 --> 01:03:06,179
叫他们来海豚酒店
Send them to the Dolphin Hotel.

928
01:03:06,215 --> 01:03:07,944
我一会儿给你打过去
I'll call you back.

929
01:03:10,519 --> 01:03:12,714
- 你在纽约？ - 对！
- You're in the city? - Yes!

930
01:03:12,755 --> 01:03:15,246
- 莱克星顿大街2254号 - 你来这干什么？
- 2254 Lexington. - What are you doing in New York?

931
01:03:15,291 --> 01:03:18,727
等等再和你解释 海豚酒店，1408房，求你！
I'll tell you later. The Dolphin Hotel, room 1408.

932
01:03:18,761 --> 01:03:20,729
- 又是这样 - 求你了
- That's just perfect. - Please.

933
01:03:20,763 --> 01:03:22,594
麦克，你就这样走了，音讯全无
You walk out, you disappear. Leaving me what?

934
01:03:22,631 --> 01:03:24,895
我算什么呢？离婚？分居？
Not divorced. Separated? I don't know, it's not clear.

935
01:03:24,934 --> 01:03:27,664
- 突然间你又需要我了？ - 莉莉，我现在情况真的很糟
- Suddenly you need me? - Lily, I'm in a real bad spot here.

936
01:03:27,703 --> 01:03:30,467
- 非常危险，你明白吗？ - OK，麦克，慢点
- I'm in danger. You understand? - Okay, Mike. Slow down.

937
01:03:30,506 --> 01:03:31,734
我不知道你到底在说什么
You're not making any sense.

938
01:03:31,774 --> 01:03:34,902
有人要杀我
There's something trying to kill me right now.

939
01:03:38,814 --> 01:03:40,577
不，莉莉！
No, Lily!

940
01:03:40,616 --> 01:03:42,743
不！不！
No no no!

941
01:04:07,009 --> 01:04:08,840
(water pattering)

942
01:04:43,746 --> 01:04:45,509
我可有刀子！
I've got a knife!

943
01:04:50,553 --> 01:04:51,781
(grunting)

944
01:05:01,130 --> 01:05:03,121
哪条路能出去？哪条？
(mumbling) That's the way out.

945
01:05:03,165 --> 01:05:05,224
Or that way. Or that way.

946
01:05:08,237 --> 01:05:09,431
这条能出去
All right, that's the way out.

947
01:05:09,471 --> 01:05:10,938
(baby crying)

948
01:05:10,973 --> 01:05:13,066
女士，让我进去！
Lady, let me in!

949
01:05:13,108 --> 01:05:16,839
- 救命！救命！ - 快睡觉吧
- Help! Help! - Please, sleep.

950
01:05:16,879 --> 01:05:19,609
- 女士，让我进来！ - 麦克！
- Lady, I'm coming through! - Mike!

951
01:05:19,648 --> 01:05:22,811
能不能帮我一把？你去哪儿了？
Mike, can you help me? Where'd you go?

952
01:05:22,851 --> 01:05:26,287
抽烟去了，帮你什么？
Mike: I got to get some cigarettes. You want something?

953
01:05:28,023 --> 01:05:30,389
天啊！
Jesus Christ!

954
01:05:32,494 --> 01:05:34,223
我要走了，去加利福尼亚
Mike: I've got to go. I'll be in California.

955
01:05:34,263 --> 01:05:36,197
你不能这样
Mike, you can't do this.

956
01:05:36,232 --> 01:05:38,462
她需要你，她也失去了个孩子
She needs you. She lost a kid too.

957
01:05:38,500 --> 01:05:40,968
你这不废话么，爸
You've got an amazing talent for stating the obvious, Pop.

958
01:05:41,003 --> 01:05:42,231
你以为我不知道么？
You think I don't know that?

959
01:05:42,271 --> 01:05:44,262
我在跟你讲道理！
I'm trying to talk some sense into your head!

960
01:05:44,306 --> 01:05:47,070
- 别用手碰我，老家伙！ - 麦克！
- Don't put your hands on me, old man! - Mike!

961
01:05:47,109 --> 01:05:50,237
讲？干吗要改变终身的习惯？
Talk? Why change what appears to be the habit of a lifetime, Pop?

962
01:05:50,279 --> 01:05:51,712
你总是喜欢乱作判断
You were always great at passing judgment,

963
01:05:51,747 --> 01:05:53,647
事实是你根本毫不关心
but the problem is you never gave a shit.

964
01:05:53,682 --> 01:05:56,617
那是因为你是个扯淡作家！
I never gave a shit because you're a bullshit writer!

965
01:06:01,190 --> 01:06:02,521
妈的！
Shit!

966
01:06:10,699 --> 01:06:12,223
喂？
Hello!

967
01:06:17,539 --> 01:06:18,699
哦
Oh.

968
01:06:43,732 --> 01:06:45,097

969
01:06:50,572 --> 01:06:53,234
(screams)

970
01:06:55,878 --> 01:06:57,505
不
No.

971
01:06:57,546 --> 01:06:59,514
不，不，不，不，不
No no no no no no.

972
01:07:00,616 --> 01:07:03,141
我帮不了你
I can't help you.

973
01:07:03,185 --> 01:07:04,618
我帮不了你
I can't help you.

974
01:07:06,121 --> 01:07:08,681
不！
No!

975
01:08:00,309 --> 01:08:02,300
(groans)

976
01:08:04,847 --> 01:08:06,940
回来感觉可真好啊
It's good to be back.

977
01:08:11,754 --> 01:08:13,449
我在上面见识够了
That's enough of that.

978
01:08:22,431 --> 01:08:24,228
我要喝酒！
Alcohol.

979
01:08:26,268 --> 01:08:28,327
我只是过来看看您是否 满意我们酒店的住宿条件
I was just checking to see if the accommodations

980
01:08:28,370 --> 01:08:29,962
are exceeding your expectations.

981
01:08:30,005 --> 01:08:32,200
你他妈的当然清楚我满意了！
You know goddamn well they are!

982
01:08:32,241 --> 01:08:35,108
- 你究竟想怎么样？ - 错了，错了
- What do you want from me? - No no no.

983
01:08:35,144 --> 01:08:37,476
应该是你想怎么样
What do you want?

984
01:08:37,513 --> 01:08:40,209
你到底想怎么样，安斯林先生？
What do you want, Mr. Enslin?

985
01:08:40,249 --> 01:08:42,911
- 房间你已经看过了 - 工作，我不过是在做我的工作
- You sought this room. - It was a job. I was doing the job.

986
01:08:42,951 --> 01:08:44,976
- 什么？ - 工作！我是作家啊
- I beg your pardon? - My job! I'm a writer.

987
01:08:45,020 --> 01:08:47,989
哦，对了，你什么都不相信
Oh, that's right. You don't believe in anything.

988
01:08:48,023 --> 01:08:49,718
你喜欢铲除人们的希望
You like shattering people's hopes.

989
01:08:49,758 --> 01:08:51,055
放屁！
Oh, that's bullshit!

990
01:08:51,093 --> 01:08:52,856
那你说说人们 为什么相信鬼魂存在？
Why do you think people believe in ghosts?

991
01:08:52,895 --> 01:08:55,261
为了好玩？当然不是
For fun? No.

992
01:08:55,297 --> 01:08:58,733
是出于对死后的期望
It's the prospect of something after death.

993
01:08:58,767 --> 01:09:01,998
你毁灭了多少灵魂？
How many spirits have you broken?

994
01:09:02,037 --> 01:09:03,834
她非常痛苦
Mike's voice: She was in so much pain.

995
01:09:03,872 --> 01:09:05,931
我相信她一定在上面向我们微笑
Lily: I'm sure she's smiling down on us right now.

996
01:09:05,974 --> 01:09:08,943
你到底想怎么样？！
What do you want from me?

997
01:09:08,977 --> 01:09:10,274
恩？
Huh?

998
01:09:10,312 --> 01:09:13,338
你想怎么样？！
What do you want from me?

999
01:09:13,382 --> 01:09:15,043
你…
You...

1000
01:09:16,051 --> 01:09:17,348
你个…
you little...

1001
01:09:17,386 --> 01:09:20,355
(muttering)

1002
01:09:20,389 --> 01:09:22,949
你想怎么样？！
(yelling) What do you want?

1003
01:09:22,991 --> 01:09:24,982
怎么样？！
What?!

1004
01:09:28,030 --> 01:09:31,830
我要…喝酒！
I want my drink!

1005
01:09:43,512 --> 01:09:46,242
你赢了，你赢了
You win. You win.

1006
01:09:53,922 --> 01:09:55,719
- 妈妈 - 恩？
- Katie: Mommy? - Lily: Hmm?

1007
01:09:55,757 --> 01:09:57,987
为什么圣经是紫色的？
Katie: Why is the Bible purple?

1008
01:09:58,026 --> 01:10:00,290
我也不知道，是结婚礼物
(chuckles) I don't know why it's purple.

1009
01:10:00,329 --> 01:10:03,787
It was a wedding present.

1010
01:10:03,832 --> 01:10:06,323
我祖母千辛万苦从匈牙利带回来
My grandmother brought it all the way from Hungary.

1011
01:10:06,368 --> 01:10:07,995
将来这本圣经就会归你所有
Someday it'll be yours.

1012
01:10:11,640 --> 01:10:14,336
我要去的地方有很多人吗？
Are there people where I'm going?

1013
01:10:18,347 --> 01:10:22,511
你哪都不会去的，孩子
Hey, you're not going anywhere, kiddo.

1014
01:10:22,551 --> 01:10:24,143
你就和我们一起待在这里
You're gonna stay right here with us.

1015
01:10:24,186 --> 01:10:26,211
爸爸，人总是要死的
Daddy...

1016
01:10:26,255 --> 01:10:28,553
everyone dies.

1017
01:10:30,158 --> 01:10:32,490
- 只有当人年老后 - 而且是很老很老
When they're old.

1018
01:10:32,528 --> 01:10:34,120
When they're much older.

1019
01:10:34,162 --> 01:10:36,426
之后他们会去到一个更好的地方
Okay, and then they go to a better place.

1020
01:10:36,465 --> 01:10:39,457
那里非常美丽
And it's beautiful there.

1021
01:10:40,602 --> 01:10:42,433
你所有的朋友都会在那
And all your friends will be there.

1022
01:10:48,243 --> 01:10:49,972
- 上帝也在那儿吗？ - 是的
Is God there?

1023
01:10:51,013 --> 01:10:52,139
Yes.

1024
01:10:53,782 --> 01:10:55,647
你真的相信这些吗，爸爸？
Do you really believe that, Daddy?

1025
01:10:57,219 --> 01:10:58,982
是的
Yes.

1026
01:11:01,490 --> 01:11:03,481
你知道我怎么想 我们应该多做点什么！
Mike: You know what I think! We should have done more!

1027
01:11:03,525 --> 01:11:05,186
- 能做的我们都做了！ - 没有！
- We did everything we could! - No, we didn't!

1028
01:11:05,227 --> 01:11:07,491
- 我们应该帮她抗争病魔 - 哦，上帝啊
- We should have helped her fight... - Oh my God.

1029
01:11:07,529 --> 01:11:09,759
而不是给她灌输天堂云彩 极乐世界这些没用的童话！
...instead of filling her head full of these stories

1030
01:11:09,798 --> 01:11:12,062
about heavens and the clouds and nirvana

1031
01:11:12,100 --> 01:11:13,931
and all that bullshit!

1032
01:11:13,969 --> 01:11:15,493
她喜欢这些童话
Those stories, she like them.

1033
01:11:15,537 --> 01:11:17,368
我出去抽烟了
I'm going to get some cigarettes, okay?

1034
01:11:17,406 --> 01:11:19,169
(phone ringing)

1035
01:11:25,769 --> 01:11:27,369
[接收中…]

1036
01:12:55,103 --> 01:12:58,231
我们仔细考虑
Mike's voice: We ponder the situation.

1037
01:12:58,273 --> 01:13:01,606
试图精确描述…
I'm trying to accurately describe...

1038
01:13:02,878 --> 01:13:05,506
心中的恐惧
Orpheus on the Orpheum Circuit

1039
01:13:05,547 --> 01:13:07,538
探戈光…
bathed in tango light,

1040
01:13:07,582 --> 01:13:10,847
那种能令死人走出坟墓…
the kind of light that makes the dead...

1041
01:13:12,120 --> 01:13:14,315
纵情跳起探戈的光
get out of their graves and tango.

1042
01:13:14,356 --> 01:13:17,450
这是第9层…
Now this is level nine...

1043
01:13:17,492 --> 01:13:19,653
(shivering)

1044
01:13:19,695 --> 01:13:21,663
地狱的尽头
The deepest level of hell,

1045
01:13:21,697 --> 01:13:25,463
远离阳光和温暖
furthest removed from all light and warmth.

1046
01:13:27,402 --> 01:13:29,336
这是6
This is six.

1047
01:13:29,371 --> 01:13:31,999
妈的是5，我看到地毯的图案了
It's goddamn five.

1048
01:13:32,040 --> 01:13:34,201
I think I see the pattern.

1049
01:13:34,242 --> 01:13:37,507
Yes, I can see the pattern.

1050
01:13:37,546 --> 01:13:38,945
麦克
Lily: Mike.

1051
01:13:38,980 --> 01:13:42,143
麦克，听到我了吗？
Mike, can you hear me?

1052
01:13:42,184 --> 01:13:45,278
- 麦克，你到底在哪里？ - 莉莉
- Michael, where the hell are you? - Lily.

1053
01:13:45,320 --> 01:13:47,117
麦克？
Michael?

1054
01:13:47,155 --> 01:13:49,180
- 麦克 - 莉莉
- Mike. - Lily.

1055
01:13:49,224 --> 01:13:51,988
麦克，听到我了吗？
(sighs) Michael, can you hear me?

1056
01:13:52,027 --> 01:13:53,517
莉莉
Lily.

1057
01:13:56,865 --> 01:13:59,698
噢，谢天谢地，我一直在找你
Oh my God. Thank God. Jesus, I've been trying to get through!

1058
01:13:59,735 --> 01:14:01,896
- 你报警了吗？ - 报了，他们就在酒店
- Did you call the cops? - Yeah yeah, they're at the hotel.

1059
01:14:01,937 --> 01:14:03,962
- 你刚才说的是海豚酒店吗？ - 是的
- Didn't you say the Dolphin? - Yes.

1060
01:14:04,005 --> 01:14:06,473
- 你确定？ - 是的，1408房
- You're sure? - Yes yes, 1408.

1061
01:14:06,508 --> 01:14:09,534
麦克，警察现在就在1408房
Mike, they're in 1408.

1062
01:14:09,578 --> 01:14:11,409
房间是空的
The room's empty.

1063
01:14:11,446 --> 01:14:12,811
麦克？
Mike?

1064
01:14:14,049 --> 01:14:16,540
麦克，听到我了吗？
Michael, can you hear me?

1065
01:14:16,585 --> 01:14:18,109
麦克？
- (grunts) - Michael?

1066
01:14:18,153 --> 01:14:20,178
麦克，你到底在什么地方？
Michael, where the hell are you?

1067
01:14:20,222 --> 01:14:22,918
我现在好冷，没法和你解释清楚
I'm afraid I can't express myself in this climate.

1068
01:14:22,958 --> 01:14:24,755
冷静下，会有办法的
Calm down, okay? We'll figure this out.

1069
01:14:24,793 --> 01:14:26,852
- 别慌 - 我要死了
- Don't panic. - I'm supposed to die here.

1070
01:14:26,895 --> 01:14:29,329
麦克，别这样，你不会死的
Michael, stop it! You're not gonna die, okay?

1071
01:14:29,364 --> 01:14:31,298
别走，我15分钟就能赶到酒店
Don't move. I can be there in 15 minutes.

1072
01:14:34,636 --> 01:14:36,934
麦克，麦克
Mike? Michael?

1073
01:14:36,972 --> 01:14:40,100
15分钟，时间不够
15 minutes isn't enough time.

1074
01:14:40,142 --> 01:14:42,542
- 太晚了 - 不，不会晚的
- It'll be too late. - No, it won't be too late.

1075
01:14:42,577 --> 01:14:44,044
- 莉莉 - 别…
- Lily. - Don't...

1076
01:14:44,079 --> 01:14:46,479
15分钟正好，太好了
Actually, 15 minutes is perfect.

1077
01:14:46,515 --> 01:14:48,642
来吧，现在就过来
It's perfect. Just come up. Come now.

1078
01:14:48,683 --> 01:14:50,014
- 好的 - 我需要你
- Good, yes. - I need you.

1079
01:14:50,051 --> 01:14:52,019
现在我就指望你了，莉莉
You've always been someone I can count on.

1080
01:14:52,053 --> 01:14:55,079
我知道凯蒂死后我们很少沟通
I know we haven't talked a lot since... since Katie died,

1081
01:14:55,123 --> 01:14:57,990
- 但是我需要你，亲爱的 - 等等！
- but I need you, sweetie. - Wait!

1082
01:14:58,026 --> 01:15:00,426
现在我不能和你解释 你快过来，我们好好谈谈
I can't explain it here. You just have to come here and talk to me.

1083
01:15:00,462 --> 01:15:01,588
我也想你，但…
I miss you too, but...

1084
01:15:01,630 --> 01:15:03,359
你到了之后，不要和任何人说话 直接到1408房来找我
When you get here, don't talk to anybody.

1085
01:15:03,398 --> 01:15:04,797
- 走进来 - 闭嘴！闭嘴！
Just come straight up to the 14th floor.

1086
01:15:04,833 --> 01:15:06,994
- Walk through the door. - Shut up! Shut up!

1087
01:15:07,035 --> 01:15:09,162
- 这事关生死，亲爱的 - 千万别过来！
- It's life or death, sweetie. - Do not come up to the room!

1088
01:15:09,204 --> 01:15:10,899
- OK - 千万别过来！
- Okay. - Don't come up to the room!

1089
01:15:10,939 --> 01:15:12,634
- 我要和你谈谈凯蒂 - 闭嘴！不要！
- I need to talk to you about Katie. - Don't! Shut up!

1090
01:15:12,674 --> 01:15:14,733
- 莉莉，别听他的！ - 恩，好
- Lily, don't listen to him! - Yes, good.

1091
01:15:14,776 --> 01:15:16,573
- 那是圈套！千万别过来！ - 我一会儿就到
- It's a trick! Don't come up here! - I'll be right there.

1092
01:15:16,611 --> 01:15:18,408
(crackling)

1093
01:15:22,350 --> 01:15:24,682
莉莉！莉莉！
Lily! Lily!

1094
01:15:31,426 --> 01:15:33,485
(groans)

1095
01:15:35,597 --> 01:15:37,792
(screaming)

1096
01:15:47,843 --> 01:15:49,310
(moans)

1097
01:15:54,316 --> 01:15:56,580
(girl screaming)

1098
01:15:56,618 --> 01:15:59,485
我的孩子，我的孩子
Woman: My baby! My baby!

1099
01:16:00,722 --> 01:16:03,520
我们正冲向礁石
Man: She's heading for the rocks!

1100
01:16:03,558 --> 01:16:06,789
我不想死！
I don't want to die!

1101
01:16:06,828 --> 01:16:08,159
(women screaming)

1102
01:16:08,196 --> 01:16:11,461
- (dogs barking) - (horse whinnies)

1103
01:16:23,211 --> 01:16:25,702
天啊！
Man: Oh God!

1104
01:16:25,747 --> 01:16:27,840
有人落水了！
Man overboard!

1105
01:16:28,850 --> 01:16:30,977
(screaming continues)

1106
01:16:33,221 --> 01:16:34,882
妈的！
Come on!

1107
01:16:41,696 --> 01:16:43,891

1295
01:33:42,016 --> 01:33:43,950
你不能这样2次 把她从我们身边带走

You can't.

1297

# And yes, we've just begun #

1312
01:35:18,245 --> 01:35:22,045
# Sharing horizons that are new to us #

1313
01:35:23,751 --> 01:35:28,711
# Watching the signs along the way #

1314
01:35:28,756 --> 01:35:31,953
# Talking it over, just the two of us. #

1315
01:35:31,992 --> 01:35:32,526

为什么你们不干脆杀了我？
Why don't you just kill me?

She'll be here in five minutes and we'll send her straight up.

她与这事无关
She's not involved.

1338
01:38:14,454 --> 01:38:17,287
不能伤害她
You can't have her.

1339

我不想再和你们吵了

(voice distorts) Ignore the siren. Even if you leave this room,

你所有朋友现在都死了

我这辈子一直都活得很自私
Mike's voice: I lived the life of a selfish man.

1349
01:38:58,465 --> 01:39:01,866
但我并不一定要私自的死去
But I don't have to die that way.

1350
01:39:03,437 --> 01:39:04,836
如果我非要死的话 那么我也要和你同归于尽
If I'm going down,

1351

也许这一切都是虚幻 也许连我自己都不真实
This may not all be real,

1353
01:39:13,213 --> 01:39:15,875
and I may not even be real,

1354
01:39:15,916 --> 01:39:18,214
但这火焰…
but this fire...

1355
01:39:21,121 --> 01:39:23,453
无疑是真实的
that's got to be real.

1356
01:39:33,634 --> 01:39:35,397
见鬼去吧！

- What's going on? - Driver: I don't know, lady.

1364
01:40:10,103 --> 01:40:13,334
看起来要等一阵子了 肯定是出事了
This might take a while. Something must have happened.

1365
01:40:13,373 --> 01:40:15,739

(man moaning)

1368
01:40:23,517 --> 01:40:26,816
别吵，混蛋
Keep quiet, you bastard.

帮帮我，求你帮帮我
Please, you've gotta help me. No, help me.

- 冷静 - 我丈夫还在里面
- Calm down. - My husband's inside.

我丈夫还在里面，求你救救他

求你救救他！
You've gotta help him, please!

1373
01:40:35,796 --> 01:40:37,195
哪楼的？哪楼的？
What floor? What floor?

1374
01:40:37,230 --> 01:40:39,357
14楼，1408 麦克・安斯林
14th floor, 1408. Mike Enslin.

过来
Please come here.

1376
01:40:41,868 --> 01:40:45,668
别浪费时间了
- (moaning) - You're wasting your time.

1377
01:40:51,178 --> 01:40:53,772
我们是为了这个故事来的
We're here to do the job,

1378
01:40:53,814 --> 01:40:55,941
我们要镇定自若
and we don't rattle.

1379
01:40:59,386 --> 01:41:02,116
房间装饰丑陋
The decor is in tatters

1380
01:41:02,155 --> 01:41:04,055
空气污浊
and the staff surly.

1381
01:41:04,091 --> 01:41:07,026
但是就恐怖指数来说
But on the Shiver Scale...

1382

01:42:24,404 --> 01:42:27,464
愿他长眠于此地
and we commit his body to the ground,

1391
01:42:27,507 --> 01:42:31,068
尘归尘，土归土
earth to earth, ashes to ashes,

1392
01:42:31,111 --> 01:42:34,672
dust to dust.

1393
01:42:34,714 --> 01:42:36,375
望您安息
May you rest in peace.

1394
01:42:36,416 --> 01:42:38,213
阿门
Amen.

1395
01:42:38,251 --> 01:42:39,980
阿门
All: Amen.

1396
01:42:40,020 --> 01:42:42,488
好了，他们现在在一起了
Well, they're together now.

1397
01:42:46,660 --> 01:42:48,924
走吧
Let's go.

1398
01:42:56,369 --> 01:42:58,564
安斯林夫人？
Olin: Mrs. Enslin?

1399
01:43:02,909 --> 01:43:05,400
我…
I...

1400
01:43:05,445 --> 01:43:07,811
很抱歉在这个时候打扰
I am sorry to intrude at such a delicate time,

1401
01:43:07,848 --> 01:43:10,646
我在海豚酒店工作 我认识你丈夫
but I knew your husband. I worked at the Dolphin.

1402
01:43:10,684 --> 01:43:12,652
哦
Oh.

1403
01:43:12,686 --> 01:43:15,553
清理的时候 看到了些他的东西
While we were cleaning up, we came across some of his belongings.

1404
01:43:15,589 --> 01:43:17,955
不用了，谢谢
No, thank you.

1405
01:43:17,991 --> 01:43:19,982
它们是你丈夫的象征，夫人
They are of such a personal nature, ma'am.

1406
01:43:20,026 --> 01:43:22,153
- 我想你可能会要… - 不，拜托
- I figured maybe you would want to... - No, please.

1407
01:43:22,195 --> 01:43:24,390
这不是我纪念他的方法
It's not how I want to remember him.

1408
01:43:24,431 --> 01:43:26,831
我想你能理解的
I'm sure you understand.

1409
01:43:26,867 --> 01:43:28,528
哦，当然我理解
Oh yes, yes. Of course I understand.

1410
01:43:28,568 --> 01:43:31,230
但要知道他做了件很伟大的事
But it's important that you know that he did a great thing.

1411
01:43:31,271 --> 01:43:33,466
他没有白死
He did not die in vain.

1412
01:43:33,507 --> 01:43:35,805
你在说什么
What are you talking about?

1413
01:43:35,842 --> 01:43:38,003
因为他，这房间不存在了，这…
Because of him, the room won't reopen. It's been...

1414
01:43:38,044 --> 01:43:40,137
好了，别说了
All right, okay, stop.

1415
01:43:40,180 --> 01:43:43,013
让她休息下
Just give the lady some air.

1416
01:43:43,049 --> 01:43:45,279
她经受得够多了
She's been through enough, don't you think?

1417
01:44:26,092 --> 01:44:29,994
(static)

1418
01:44:30,030 --> 01:44:32,055
第一局很可怕，奥林先生
Mike: Round one goes to the hideous Mr. Olin

1419
01:44:32,098 --> 01:44:33,395
非常有侵略性
for effective aggressiveness.

1420
01:44:33,433 --> 01:44:35,867
不得不承认 我差点就被他的阵势给唬住
I have to admit, he had me going.

1421
01:44:35,902 --> 01:44:37,335
冷静
Get ahold of yourself.

1422
01:44:37,370 --> 01:44:40,032
你看到的都是幻觉
You're running to places that aren't real.

1423
01:44:40,073 --> 01:44:41,597
爸爸
Katie: Daddy,

1424
01:44:41,641 --> 01:44:43,632
难道你不再爱我了？
don't you love me anymore?

1425
01:44:43,677 --> 01:44:45,804
我当然爱你了，亲爱的
Mike: Of course I do, sweetheart.

1426
01:44:45,845 --> 01:44:48,405
- 难道你不爱我，爸爸？ - 我当然爱你了，亲爱的
- Don't you love me, Daddy? - Of course I do, honey,

1427
01:44:48,448 --> 01:44:50,643
爱你胜过一切
more than anything. I got you now.

1428
01:44:50,684 --> 01:44:53,312
我们在一起，亲爱的 一切都很好
I got you right here, sweetie. Everything's fine.

1429
01:44:53,353 --> 01:44:56,720
你和我在一起，凯蒂 不会再有人把你带走了
I got you, Katie. Nobody's ever gonna take you away again.

1430
01:44:56,756 --> 01:44:58,553
爸爸？
Katie: Daddy?

1431
01:44:58,592 --> 01:45:01,652
爸爸！爸爸！
Daddy! Daddy!

1432
01:45:01,695 --> 01:45:03,754
爸爸！

1433
01:45:03,797 --> 01:45:06,129
爸爸！
Daddy!

1434
01:45:10,303 --> 01:45:11,930
(screams)

1435
01:45:14,574 --> 01:45:16,132
嘿，宝贝
Hey, sweetie.

1436
01:45:55,281 --> 01:45:57,943
(siren wailing)

1437
01:46:07,627 --> 01:46:10,152
(wind howling)

1438
01:46:16,636 --> 01:46:18,797
爸爸！
Katie: Daddy!

1439
01:46:18,838 --> 01:46:21,830
爸爸！
Daddy!

1440
01:46:21,875 --> 01:46:24,343
恩，来了
