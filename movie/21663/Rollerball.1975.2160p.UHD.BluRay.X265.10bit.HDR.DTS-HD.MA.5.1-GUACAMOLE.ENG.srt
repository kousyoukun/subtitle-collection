You've had 10 years in this game, Jonathan.

On your special program.

Who wants that?

When this special was first planned by RCI
Energy, we saw it as a good thing.

Now the executive
directorate wants a change.

the whole world is waiting for it,

You know, the team,
they, uh, they depend on me.

281
00:22:01,788 --> 00:22:04,665
Jonathan, let's think this through together.

282
00:22:05,083 --> 00:22:07,710
You know how a game serves us?

283
00:22:08,921 --> 00:22:11,255
It has a definite social purpose.

284
00:22:12,132 --> 00:22:14,967
Nations are bankrupt, gone,

285
00:22:15,844 --> 00:22:18,346
none of that tribal warfare anymore.

286
00:22:19,181 --> 00:22:22,266
Even the corporate wars
are a thing of the past.

287
00:22:23,852 --> 00:22:25,186
I know that. It's just...

288
00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:28,439
So now, we have
the majors and their executives.

289
00:22:28,524 --> 00:22:31,776
Transport, food, communication,

290
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:34,612
housing, luxury, energy.

291
00:22:35,364 --> 00:22:38,991

00:22:39,326 --> 00:22:40,910
for the common good.

293
00:22:40,994 --> 00:22:42,745
The team, is a unit.

294
00:22:42,829 --> 00:22:44,372
It plays with certain rhythms.

295
00:22:44,456 --> 00:22:47,041
So does an executive team, Jonathan.

296
00:22:47,125 --> 00:22:50,920
Now, everyone
has all the comforts, you know that.

297
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:54,131
No poverty, no sickness,

298
00:22:54,466 --> 00:22:56,509
no needs and many luxuries,

299
00:22:57,261 --> 00:23:01,180
which you enjoy
just as if you were in the executive class.

300
00:23:01,473 --> 00:23:05,142
Corporate society takes care of everything,

301
00:23:05,227 --> 00:23:07,228
and all it asks of anyone,

302
00:23:07,312 --> 00:23:10,231
or has ever asked of anyone, ever,

303
00:23:10,816 --> 00:23:13,568
is not to interfere
with management decisions.

304
00:23:14,444 --> 00:23:17,738
I know. I don't mean to resist.

305
00:23:17,823 --> 00:23:19,532
I'm just trying to understand.

306
00:23:19,616 --> 00:23:21,826
This is for your own benefit.

307
00:23:21,910 --> 00:23:24,245
You must know that, Jonathan.

308
00:23:24,329 --> 00:23:26,664
All decisions concerning you are.

309
00:23:28,917 --> 00:23:31,502
Well, I, uh, lost Ella.

310
00:23:33,672 --> 00:23:36,340
The corporation took my wife away
because an executive wanted her.

311
00:23:36,425 --> 00:23:38,301
I'm not gonna review all that again.

312
00:23:38,385 --> 00:23:39,885
It was before I took over here,

313
00:23:39,970 --> 00:23:41,345
and I had nothing to do with it.

314
00:23:41,805 --> 00:23:45,474
And from what I hear,
your wife wanted to leave herself.

315
00:23:45,851 --> 00:23:48,853
So, now you're going to retire.

316
00:23:49,855 --> 00:23:52,273
That shouldn't be too hard for you.

317
00:23:52,899 --> 00:23:56,068
It's a stupid game, after all. Awful game.

318
00:23:57,487 --> 00:23:58,863
You ought to be glad to be out of it.

319
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:03,200
I don't...

320
00:24:04,828 --> 00:24:07,830
I don't know, Mr. Bartholomew.
I just don't know.

321
00:24:09,791 --> 00:24:12,126
I realize you had nothing to do
with Ella leaving...

322
00:24:12,210 --> 00:24:13,961
- Jonathan, I...
- But, um...

323
00:24:16,298 --> 00:24:17,882
You're right.

324
00:24:18,091 --> 00:24:20,217
I mean, I ought to do it.

325
00:24:21,386 --> 00:24:23,262
I ought to be
perfectly happy to do what you say...

326
00:24:23,388 --> 00:24:26,891
Take your time. Take a few days.

327
00:24:27,934 --> 00:24:31,062
You've just come through a game.
You're tired.

328
00:24:31,563 --> 00:24:35,107
Go to your ranch, but think about it,

329
00:24:35,984 --> 00:24:37,985
and understand it.

330
00:24:39,112 --> 00:24:41,072
Do understand it.

331
00:25:01,343 --> 00:25:04,345
Because I don't understand your resistance,

332
00:25:04,429 --> 00:25:07,181
and I don't think anyone else will, either.

333
00:26:04,239 --> 00:26:05,448
Was your flight okay?

334
00:26:05,532 --> 00:26:06,574
Yeah. Is Clete here?

335
00:26:06,658 --> 00:26:07,658
He's in the training room.

336
00:26:07,743 --> 00:26:09,660
I'm gonna go say hello.

337
00:26:11,329 --> 00:26:12,580
- Jonathan.
- Hmm?

338
00:26:14,166 --> 00:26:16,125
Look what I got for breakfast.

339
00:26:16,209 --> 00:26:17,209
Hmm?

340
00:26:17,294 --> 00:26:19,628
It's a notice from the corporation.

341
00:26:19,713 --> 00:26:21,589
- What's it say?
- (SIGHING)

342
00:26:22,215 --> 00:26:24,633
Oh, that I should get out of here.

343
00:26:24,843 --> 00:26:28,429
You know, go away, vanish.
That kind of thing.

344
00:26:29,514 --> 00:26:30,598
You know anything about that?

345
00:26:32,392 --> 00:26:35,144
Yeah, I kind of heard something about it.

346
00:26:36,688 --> 00:26:37,772
You knew it was coming.

347
00:26:40,066 --> 00:26:42,318
We've been together six months.

348
00:26:44,613 --> 00:26:47,114
Didn't you even want to say goodbye?

349
00:26:48,992 --> 00:26:50,826
We'll talk about it later, okay?

350
00:26:50,911 --> 00:26:52,661
You didn't, did you?

351
00:26:53,371 --> 00:26:54,413
Hmm?

352
00:26:56,625 --> 00:26:59,585
You didn't even want me here
when you got back.

353
00:26:59,669 --> 00:27:01,462
I gotta go see Cletus.

354
00:27:01,546 --> 00:27:03,422
What do you want me
to do in the meantime?

355
00:27:03,507 --> 00:27:04,799
I want you to take it easy.

356
00:27:05,801 --> 00:27:06,801
Uh...

357
00:27:08,136 --> 00:27:10,971
I want you to go in
and fix us something to eat.

358
00:27:11,056 --> 00:27:14,016
Clete's come a long way and I'm hungry.

359
00:27:14,392 --> 00:27:15,726
All right?

360
00:27:17,103 --> 00:27:18,229
Okay.

361
00:27:23,068 --> 00:27:24,235
Jonathan?

362
00:27:26,696 --> 00:27:28,697
I'm glad you're all right.

363
00:27:33,787 --> 00:27:35,287
(CLETUS GRUNTING)

364
00:27:40,877 --> 00:27:42,253
(CHUCKLES)

365
00:27:43,922 --> 00:27:46,131
Come on. All right, come on.

366
00:27:46,216 --> 00:27:47,466
(TAPPING)

367
00:27:48,343 --> 00:27:49,593
Come.

368
00:27:54,266 --> 00:27:55,599
I'm tired enough.

369
00:27:55,684 --> 00:27:57,351
Yeah. Uh-huh. Well...

370
00:28:04,484 --> 00:28:05,860
(CHUCKLES)

371
00:28:07,612 --> 00:28:08,612
(GRUNTS)

372
00:28:13,493 --> 00:28:15,452
- I caught you, didn't I, baby?
- Huh?

373
00:28:15,537 --> 00:28:17,204
- Two games running.
- What?

374
00:28:17,289 --> 00:28:19,081
You did that in the last two games.

375
00:28:19,165 --> 00:28:21,041
Show the forward left.

376
00:28:21,126 --> 00:28:23,377
You're standing on your left skate.

377
00:28:23,461 --> 00:28:26,714
Do that in Tokyo,
they'll take your arm home for lunch.

378
00:28:26,798 --> 00:28:28,215
You with me?

379
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:30,968
(LAUGHS) Okay.

380
00:28:32,053 --> 00:28:33,470
You practice that a little for me, huh?

381
00:28:33,555 --> 00:28:34,680
All right.

382
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:36,974
(LAUGHING)

383
00:28:42,147 --> 00:28:45,316
CLETUS: Hell, I forget
which corporation is which.

384
00:28:45,650 --> 00:28:47,985
Any ass knows that fire's energy.

385
00:28:49,487 --> 00:28:54,325
What about the music?
Where's the music come from, huh?

386
00:28:55,827 --> 00:28:57,119
Okay if I have one of these?

387
00:28:57,203 --> 00:28:58,579
Go on, have all of it.

388
00:28:58,663 --> 00:29:00,080
(LAUGHING)

389
00:29:10,926 --> 00:29:13,928
I forget what corporation's
running what city.

390
00:29:16,848 --> 00:29:18,724
Chicago's still a food city,

391
00:29:20,268 --> 00:29:22,353
but what about Indianapolis?

392
00:29:22,771 --> 00:29:23,854
Whatever happened to that town?

393
00:29:24,606 --> 00:29:26,023
Whatever happened to Mackie?

394
00:29:27,442 --> 00:29:30,235
Yeah, things were
much simpler when I was a kid.

395
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:31,695
We still had three nations.

396
00:29:32,322 --> 00:29:35,366
That was before the corporate wars,
even before rollerball.

397
00:29:35,450 --> 00:29:36,659
Before everything.

398
00:29:37,410 --> 00:29:38,494
You believe in kids?

399
00:29:39,245 --> 00:29:40,788
I remember someone telling me about

400
00:29:40,872 --> 00:29:43,916
the National Football League
and the World Cup.

401
00:29:44,334 --> 00:29:45,334
Where you going?

402
00:29:45,418 --> 00:29:46,877
MACKIE: Indianapolis.

403
00:29:51,716 --> 00:29:53,884
What do you know about that stuff, Clete?

404
00:29:53,969 --> 00:29:55,344
I mean...

405
00:29:56,137 --> 00:30:00,057
Know how the corporations
got started, about the corporate wars?

406
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:02,476
They were nasty! Whoo!

407
00:30:03,144 --> 00:30:05,104
But nobody talks about that.

408
00:30:05,188 --> 00:30:06,855
Well, except among friends.

409
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:08,440
Yeah. (LAUGHING)

410
00:30:09,067 --> 00:30:11,151
I remember your rookie year.

411
00:30:11,736 --> 00:30:14,029
You were mean and tight.

412
00:30:14,114 --> 00:30:16,156
Best player I ever coached.

413
00:30:16,741 --> 00:30:19,410
Nobody could lay a hand on you that year.

414
00:30:19,703 --> 00:30:21,203
- Remember?
- Yeah.

415
00:30:22,247 --> 00:30:24,164
Look, I... I gotta ask you something.

416
00:30:24,249 --> 00:30:26,667
It figures. Go ahead. I'm listening.

417
00:30:27,252 --> 00:30:28,669
Well...

418
00:30:28,753 --> 00:30:31,088
Something going on with the game.

419
00:30:32,549 --> 00:30:36,260
I don't know what it is.
I don't think I'm supposed to know.

420
00:30:36,553 --> 00:30:37,636
What's that?

421
00:30:38,555 --> 00:30:40,347
They want me to quit.

422
00:30:49,315 --> 00:30:52,192
And why would they want you to do that?

423
00:30:53,069 --> 00:30:54,737
I don't know.

424
00:30:54,821 --> 00:30:57,364
That's what I'd like you to find out.

425
00:30:57,866 --> 00:30:59,199
I can try.

426
00:30:59,617 --> 00:31:01,535
Hearjust about
everything going on in the game

427
00:31:01,619 --> 00:31:03,370
one way or another.

428
00:31:03,663 --> 00:31:05,539
That's what I mean.

429
00:31:05,623 --> 00:31:07,958
I can't think of another executive
who'd tell me a thing.

430
00:31:11,254 --> 00:31:13,213
Well, like I say, I'll...

431
00:31:14,758 --> 00:31:16,008
I'll try.

432
00:31:17,886 --> 00:31:18,969
But I don't think there's much I...

433
00:31:19,304 --> 00:31:20,888
Look...

434
00:31:20,972 --> 00:31:22,723
No troubles for either of us, Clete.

435
00:31:22,807 --> 00:31:24,266
Just find out what you can.

436
00:31:26,269 --> 00:31:28,896
Well, trust me, Jonathan, you know you can.

437
00:31:29,355 --> 00:31:30,481
Sure.

438
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:32,941
Sit down.

439
00:31:34,319 --> 00:31:36,070
Yeah. (CHUCKLING)

440
00:32:03,515 --> 00:32:04,890
Nice, boys.

441
00:32:08,019 --> 00:32:09,311
Yo, Johnny.

442
00:32:12,398 --> 00:32:14,191
That's the Houston stride.

443
00:32:16,069 --> 00:32:17,486
You boys want to make this team,
play for Houston,

444
00:32:17,570 --> 00:32:19,571
you're gonna have to learn it.

445
00:32:19,656 --> 00:32:23,367
We pride ourselves on being a power team.

446
00:32:23,701 --> 00:32:24,743
MOONPIE: That's right.

447
00:32:24,828 --> 00:32:26,703
We're power. We're mean.

448
00:32:26,788 --> 00:32:28,956
Now, that doesn't mean to say

449
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:32,000
we'd like to have you
hanging back there on a rail,

450
00:32:32,085 --> 00:32:33,127
in a fistfight,

451
00:32:33,211 --> 00:32:34,962
just standing there
fighting somebody in section A

452
00:32:35,046 --> 00:32:36,505
when you're supposed to be in section B.

453
00:32:36,589 --> 00:32:39,633
I'm coming up to score, and you ain't in the
section you're supposed to be in,

454
00:32:39,759 --> 00:32:40,968
don't do us no good.

455
00:32:41,052 --> 00:32:42,136
Right.

456
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:44,513
Who's the two new catchers here?

457
00:32:45,265 --> 00:32:46,515
Right.

458
00:32:46,599 --> 00:32:48,267
Give me that ball.

459
00:32:50,728 --> 00:32:52,104
Don't, uh,

460
00:32:53,356 --> 00:32:56,066
stick your hand in that gutter too quick.

461
00:32:56,151 --> 00:32:58,443
Wait till this ball comes down on the track.

462
00:32:58,736 --> 00:32:59,820
(THUDDING)

463
00:32:59,904 --> 00:33:03,323
Don't get too anxious.
That thing will take your arm right off.

464
00:33:03,408 --> 00:33:04,741
Now, the bikers.

465
00:33:05,118 --> 00:33:06,451
A biker

466
00:33:08,538 --> 00:33:11,456
might sacrifice a little three-minute penalty

467
00:33:11,708 --> 00:33:13,792
and run over the top of a skater...

468
00:33:13,877 --> 00:33:15,460
Uh-huh. (WHOOPING)

469
00:33:15,545 --> 00:33:17,754
If he feels that he's skating
a little too good that day.

470
00:33:18,256 --> 00:33:20,215
So we have a few methods here in Houston.

471
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:21,341
There's hundreds.

472
00:33:21,426 --> 00:33:23,468
One, of course, is to use this shield here.

473
00:33:23,553 --> 00:33:25,846
Use your pads. Use what you got.

474
00:33:25,930 --> 00:33:27,681
Drive that arm in there.

475
00:33:27,765 --> 00:33:29,516
Keep your feet forward. Hit and move.

476
00:33:29,601 --> 00:33:30,601
You get away from the wreck.

477
00:33:30,685 --> 00:33:33,020
Always keep your feet here.
Don't come across in here.

478
00:33:33,104 --> 00:33:35,355
You get all twisted. That's sad.

479
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:37,191
Or if a biker's sitting up nice and high...

480
00:33:37,275 --> 00:33:38,901
A lot of guys like to ride high.

481
00:33:38,985 --> 00:33:40,277
- Drag one off them in there.
- (ALL LAUGHING)

482
00:33:40,361 --> 00:33:41,695
I hurt you, Blue?

483
00:33:41,779 --> 00:33:44,031
I wouldn't hurt him for the world.

484
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:46,200
Now, third method,

485
00:33:46,284 --> 00:33:48,660
kind of one that was perfected
by a little friend of mine,

486
00:33:48,828 --> 00:33:50,120
the swoop.

487
00:33:50,455 --> 00:33:51,788
(WHOOPING)

488
00:33:52,165 --> 00:33:53,624
Swooper, that's me.

489
00:33:54,209 --> 00:33:55,459

Blue.

1156
01:25:03,775 --> 01:25:05,401
This way, please.

1157
01:25:16,871 --> 01:25:18,414
DOCTOR: May I say first, please,

1158
01:25:18,498 --> 01:25:21,208
that you played a superb game in our city.

1159
01:25:21,626 --> 01:25:22,751
Thank you.

1160
01:25:30,593 --> 01:25:33,721
A simple problem,
yet I know it is difficult for you.

1161
01:25:33,972 --> 01:25:36,140
Your teammate has no family
we can contact,

1162
01:25:36,224 --> 01:25:38,726
and permission is required now

1163
01:25:38,810 --> 01:25:40,894
before consummating matters.

1164
01:25:45,984 --> 01:25:47,985
So he's technically dead?

1165
01:25:48,069 --> 01:25:49,820
Yes, unfortunately.

1166
01:25:50,363 --> 01:25:53,741
His heart and lungs will function,
but his brain is...

1167
01:25:54,284 --> 01:25:55,826
It has expired.

1168
01:25:56,578 --> 01:25:58,787
From the first minutes we had him,
it was hopeless.

1169
01:25:59,372 --> 01:26:01,874
I believe this was explained to you.

1170
01:26:02,167 --> 01:26:03,167
He's warm.

1171
01:26:04,044 --> 01:26:05,127
Yes.

1172
01:26:05,211 --> 01:26:08,630
But if you will, please.
You must sign a release form. It is required.

1173
01:26:10,967 --> 01:26:12,468
Does he...

1174
01:26:17,932 --> 01:26:18,932
Does he dream?

1175
01:26:19,351 --> 01:26:21,602
No. There is no brain wave at all.

1176
01:26:21,686 --> 01:26:24,813
No sort of consciousness.
Just a deep coma.

1177
01:26:24,898 --> 01:26:26,190
A vegetable.

1178
01:26:26,274 --> 01:26:28,025
No dreams. Nothing.

1179
01:26:29,361 --> 01:26:30,986
Well, even...

1180
01:26:33,323 --> 01:26:35,699
A plant feels something.

1181
01:26:36,076 --> 01:26:37,743
Who can say? Please.

1182
01:26:38,536 --> 01:26:39,787
It...

1183
01:26:42,540 --> 01:26:44,166
Senses life. I mean,

1184
01:26:45,794 --> 01:26:47,669
it turns towards the sun.

1185
01:26:49,964 --> 01:26:51,090
It's alive, isn't it?

1186
01:26:51,508 --> 01:26:52,508
You must sign.

1187
01:26:54,469 --> 01:26:55,803
You...

1188
01:26:57,389 --> 01:26:58,806
You just leave him the way he is.

1189
01:27:01,393 --> 01:27:02,643
Just leave him as he is.

1190
01:27:02,727 --> 01:27:05,062
Someone will have to sign.
There's no other way.

1191
01:27:05,146 --> 01:27:06,772
Arrangements will be made.

1192
01:27:06,856 --> 01:27:08,941
Please. There are hospital rules
that have to be...

1193
01:27:09,025 --> 01:27:10,651
No, there aren't.

1194
01:27:12,195 --> 01:27:13,779
There aren't any rules at all.

1195
01:27:59,993 --> 01:28:02,536
Let me know if you have any problems.

1196
01:28:03,204 --> 01:28:05,747
You won't find any answers in Geneva.

1197
01:28:08,042 --> 01:28:09,877
Take care of your arm.

1198
01:28:45,455 --> 01:28:47,998
In my opinion, we are confronted here

1199
01:28:48,082 --> 01:28:50,292
with something of a situation.

1200
01:28:51,127 --> 01:28:54,755
Otherwise, I would not
have presumed to take up your time.

1201
01:28:55,507 --> 01:28:59,468
Once again, it concerns
the case of Jonathan E.

1202
01:29:01,679 --> 01:29:05,140
We know we don't want anything
extraordinary to happen to Jonathan.

1203
01:29:05,391 --> 01:29:07,434
We already agreed on that.

1204
01:29:08,311 --> 01:29:10,604
No accidents, nothing unnatural.

1205
01:29:11,773 --> 01:29:16,443
The game was created to demonstrate
the futility of individual effort.

1206
01:29:17,403 --> 01:29:19,655
Let the game do its work.

1207
01:29:20,698 --> 01:29:23,617
If the Energy Corporation has done all it can

1208
01:29:24,410 --> 01:29:26,703
and if a champion defeats the meaning

1209
01:29:26,788 --> 01:29:28,622
for which the game was designed,

1210
01:29:28,957 --> 01:29:31,500
then he must lose.

1211
01:29:33,002 --> 01:29:35,462
I hope you agree with my reasoning.

1212
01:29:57,277 --> 01:29:58,819
Thank you, all.

1213
01:30:55,543 --> 01:30:57,586
Will you follow me, please?

1214
01:31:35,041 --> 01:31:37,125
Hello, hello!

1215
01:31:37,251 --> 01:31:38,752
Yes, it is

1216
01:31:39,045 --> 01:31:40,921
the famous Jonathan E.

1217
01:31:41,005 --> 01:31:42,673
Oh, hard to believe.

1218
01:31:42,882 --> 01:31:44,174
Sorry we've never met.

1219
01:31:44,258 --> 01:31:46,385
The Rollerball Champion.

1220
01:31:46,469 --> 01:31:48,095
(LAUGHING) Wonderful.

1221
01:31:48,179 --> 01:31:50,430
Not many people come to see us, you know.

1222
01:31:50,515 --> 01:31:53,100
We're not easy to talk to, Zero and I.

1223
01:31:53,935 --> 01:31:56,812
We're a little confused again in here today.

1224
01:31:57,772 --> 01:31:59,564
This is embarrassing.

1225
01:32:01,067 --> 01:32:03,610
It's embarrassing to misplace things.

1226
01:32:04,112 --> 01:32:05,570
Misplacing data?

1227
01:32:05,655 --> 01:32:08,281
Mmm. The whole of the 13th century.

1228
01:32:11,452 --> 01:32:13,120
Misplaced the computers,

1229
01:32:13,204 --> 01:32:15,372
several conventional computers.

1230
01:32:15,456 --> 01:32:17,249
We can't find them.

1231
01:32:18,584 --> 01:32:21,962
We're always moving things around,
getting organized.

1232
01:32:22,964 --> 01:32:26,633
My assistants and I.
But this, this is Zero's fault.

1233
01:32:26,968 --> 01:32:29,970
Zero. He's the world's file cabinet.

1234
01:32:30,638 --> 01:32:34,599
Eh, pity. Poor old 13th century.

1235
01:32:38,312 --> 01:32:40,105
Well, come along now.

1236
01:32:40,356 --> 01:32:41,773
You want to get started, don't you?

1237
01:32:41,858 --> 01:32:43,150
- Yes, sir.
- Mmm-hmm.

1238
01:32:44,819 --> 01:32:46,069
- Oh.
- Hmm?

1239
01:32:51,325 --> 01:32:52,617
This way.

1240
01:32:53,244 --> 01:32:54,411
Now...

1241
01:32:55,288 --> 01:32:57,622
But we've lost those computers

1242
01:32:57,874 --> 01:33:00,375
with all of the 13th century in them.

1243
01:33:00,460 --> 01:33:02,878
Not much in the century, just Dante

1244
01:33:03,629 --> 01:33:05,380
and a few corrupt Popes,

1245
01:33:05,465 --> 01:33:08,341
but it's so distracting and annoying.

1246
01:33:09,093 --> 01:33:12,846
You've unlimited
restrictions here, of course.

1247
01:33:13,514 --> 01:33:15,807
You have to come so, so many times.

1248
01:33:15,892 --> 01:33:19,352
It all takes such... Such effort.

1249
01:33:19,437 --> 01:33:21,772
Do the executives still come here?

1250
01:33:21,856 --> 01:33:23,857
Oh, they used to, some of them.

1251
01:33:23,983 --> 01:33:25,108
What about the books?

1252
01:33:25,193 --> 01:33:27,110
Books? Books? Oh, no, they're all changed,

1253
01:33:27,195 --> 01:33:30,113
all transcribed, all information's here.

1254
01:33:30,740 --> 01:33:35,452
I mean, Zero, of course.
He's the central brain, the world's brain.

1255
01:33:36,037 --> 01:33:38,038
Fluid mechanics, fluidics.

1256
01:33:39,290 --> 01:33:42,918
He's liquid, you see. He's water to touch.

1257
01:33:44,337 --> 01:33:45,837
All knowledge.

1258
01:33:49,467 --> 01:33:53,553
Everything we ask has become so,
ah, so complicated now.

1259
01:33:54,222 --> 01:33:55,388
Each thing we ask...

1260
01:33:55,473 --> 01:33:58,391
This morning, we wanted
to know something about the 13th century.

1261
01:33:58,476 --> 01:34:01,728
He flows out into all our storage systems.

1262
01:34:01,813 --> 01:34:03,480
He considers everything.

1263
01:34:03,564 --> 01:34:05,232
He's become so

1264
01:34:05,858 --> 01:34:07,359
ambiguous now.

1265
01:34:07,693 --> 01:34:10,570
As if he knows nothing at all.

1266
01:34:11,072 --> 01:34:13,657
Could you tell me something
about the corporate wars?

1267
01:34:13,741 --> 01:34:15,534
Wars? Wars?

1268
01:34:15,618 --> 01:34:17,869
Oh, yes, of course, we have them all here.

1269
01:34:17,954 --> 01:34:20,622
Punic War, Prussian War,
Peloponnesian War.

1270
01:34:20,706 --> 01:34:22,207
Crimean War, Wars of the Roses.

1271
01:34:22,291 --> 01:34:26,837
One doesn't perhaps recall them
in sequence, but corporate wars.

1272
01:34:27,797 --> 01:34:31,967
Well, Zero will or can, I'm sure,
tell you anything.

1273
01:34:41,435 --> 01:34:44,354
A memory pool, you see.

1274
01:34:46,232 --> 01:34:48,358
He's supposed to tell us where things are

1275
01:34:48,442 --> 01:34:50,861
and what they might possibly mean.

1276
01:34:53,239 --> 01:34:55,156
Look, Zero, a visitor.

1277
01:34:56,784 --> 01:34:59,578
Jonathan E., the Rollerball Champion.

1278
01:35:00,872 --> 01:35:03,498
You've filed away a lot of data on him.

1279
01:35:04,792 --> 01:35:06,251
Do you remember?

1280
01:35:07,795 --> 01:35:08,962
Does it answer you?

1281
01:35:09,046 --> 01:35:10,714
Oh, yes. He speaks.

1282
01:35:11,382 --> 01:35:13,049
He finds things.

1283
01:35:13,551 --> 01:35:15,176
And loses them,

1284
01:35:15,887 --> 01:35:18,471
and confuses itself.

1285
01:35:20,975 --> 01:35:23,226
Ask anything. He'll find it for you.

1286
01:35:23,311 --> 01:35:25,270
A section on Bach...

1287
01:35:25,354 --> 01:35:26,980
Won't you, Zero?

1288
01:35:28,149 --> 01:35:30,233
All right. I'd like...

1289
01:35:32,320 --> 01:35:36,531
I'd like some information
about corporate decisions.

1290
01:35:37,158 --> 01:35:38,575
How they're made and who makes them.

1291
01:35:43,664 --> 01:35:45,415
SCIENTIST: Zero...

1292
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:47,918
You heard the question.

1293
01:35:48,502 --> 01:35:49,544
Answer him.

1294
01:35:49,629 --> 01:35:51,087
(LOW BEEP)

1295
01:35:51,172 --> 01:35:52,422
ZERO: Negative.

1296
01:35:52,506 --> 01:35:56,217
(WHISPERING) You don't
have to give him a full political briefing.

1297
01:35:57,386 --> 01:35:58,428
Answer.

1298
01:35:58,512 --> 01:35:59,804

1399
