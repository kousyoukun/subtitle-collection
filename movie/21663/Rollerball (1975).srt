1
00:03:36,717 --> 00:03:40,052
Good evening, everyone, and welcome
to Houston, the Energy City,

2
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:42,173
home of the defending
Rollerball World Champions.

3
00:03:42,806 --> 00:03:46,684
This key international battle pits
divisional champions, visiting Madrid,

4
00:03:46,685 --> 00:03:48,310
against powerful Houston.

5
00:04:05,162 --> 00:04:07,329
And here they come for
a standing ovation.

6
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:09,373
On the track comes Houston.

7
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:14,670
Houston, led by captain Jonathan E.,
again their leading scorer this year.

8
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:17,374
Jonathan! Jonathan!

9
00:04:32,647 --> 00:04:35,225
Okay, right there. Let's go.

10
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:49,538
The controller indicates
that he is ready,

11
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:51,874
and our 30 Multivision
cameras will be bringing you

12
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:54,585
all the speed, thrills and
excitement of this critical game.

13
00:04:54,586 --> 00:04:58,507
Ladies and gentlemen,
our corporate anthem.

14
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:28,846
The controller tests his
computerized equipment,

15
00:06:28,847 --> 00:06:30,514
readies for the start
of game action.

16
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:34,059
The traditional firing of the test ball
will signal we're about set to go.

17
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:41,860
The controller for tonight's
game, D.A. Niehaus.

18
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:44,778
The officials have given their
approval for play. Each team...

19
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:46,614
Come on, man.

20
00:06:46,615 --> 00:06:48,616
And now the crowd cheers once again

21
00:06:48,617 --> 00:06:53,287
as this Houston audience greets its team
led by the storied athlete Jonathan E.

22
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,582
Corral's gonna break off.

23
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:59,377
Okay, boys! Okay.

24
00:06:59,502 --> 00:07:02,125
Houston! Houston!

25
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:23,605
Now the play-by-play. Here's RD.

26
00:07:26,196 --> 00:07:29,156
The computer counts down,
one second, the ball...

27
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:31,906
First period is underway
here in Houston tonight.

28
00:07:33,745 --> 00:07:37,206
The first team to pick up the ball will
be on offense as they try for the score.

29
00:07:37,207 --> 00:07:40,042
And it's a pickup by Houston.
It's picked up by BJ.

30
00:07:40,043 --> 00:07:41,085
Yay!

31
00:07:41,086 --> 00:07:42,544
BJ moves it around the track.

32
00:07:42,545 --> 00:07:44,588
He'll try to maneuver for
the leading score...

33
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:46,173
Go on, go on.

34
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:47,626
Watch it!

35
00:07:53,765 --> 00:07:55,391
Jonathan E. holds the ball aloft.

36
00:07:55,392 --> 00:07:57,686
He must hold it out in
plain view at all times.

37
00:07:57,852 --> 00:07:59,061
Pick them up! Pick them up!

38
00:07:59,062 --> 00:08:00,889
I got them! I got it!

39
00:08:01,523 --> 00:08:04,442
On your right! On your
right! Now, baby!

40
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:12,282
Jonathan moves up the track
and up on to the side.

41
00:08:12,283 --> 00:08:14,243
Here comes Sanchez for Madrid.

42
00:08:14,244 --> 00:08:18,163
Sanchez grabs Jonathan from behind,
but off the rail comes Moonpie

43
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:20,207
and takes out four Madrid men.

44
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:23,127
The old swooper, Moonpie,
with his favorite maneuver,

45
00:08:23,128 --> 00:08:26,798
made a move from the top of the
rail and took out four Madrid men.

46
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:31,552
The remaining Madrid skaters set up
their defense in front of the goal.

47
00:08:31,553 --> 00:08:33,262
Jonathan still has the ball.

48
00:08:33,263 --> 00:08:35,806
Moving in, he'll try to cover
the slot, and surely does!

49
00:08:35,807 --> 00:08:38,510
Jonathan in front, shoots,
and it's just wide!

50
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:39,765
Regroup!

51
00:08:40,145 --> 00:08:42,021
The Houston team will
have to regroup.

52
00:08:42,022 --> 00:08:45,817
Injured on the play is Belmonte, and
he's helped off the track for Madrid.

53
00:08:46,651 --> 00:08:50,981
First period, no score, as we get set
for the firing of the second ball.

54
00:08:59,456 --> 00:09:02,124
Oh, and it hits the biker Carter!

55
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:03,709
Knocks Carter down...

56
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:05,210
Give me a hand. Move out!

57
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:07,087
Come on, look alive!

58
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:24,980
Jonathan is there, it is handed off,
the pass is complete to Jonathan.

59
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:36,075
He skates by and
knocks him down again!

60
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:37,534
Did you see that penalty?

61
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:40,204
And the officials look this over...

62
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:44,333
Keep up. Keep up.

63
00:09:44,334 --> 00:09:46,251
Moon, on your left. On your left.

64
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:48,955
Right, right, right. I got him!

65
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:56,386
Break it up! Break it up!

66
00:09:56,387 --> 00:09:58,009
Go, Jonathan, go!

67
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:00,849
Here comes Houston for the
first goal of the game.

68
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:02,267
He shoots, he scores!

69
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:03,560
Yeah!

70
00:10:04,479 --> 00:10:08,524
And at the end of the first period,
Jonathan's goal gives Houston

71
00:10:08,525 --> 00:10:10,567
a one-to-nothing lead over Madrid.

72
00:10:10,568 --> 00:10:13,070
Houston goal scored by Jonathan E.

73
00:10:13,071 --> 00:10:16,821
The time, first period, 12 minutes.

74
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,623
The ball is fired for the
start of the second period.

75
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:29,295
Madrid trailing by one goal, trying
to go on offense to tie the score.

76
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:33,253
Go, Madrid!

77
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:38,053
Watch your left!

78
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:40,264
Who did it?

79
00:10:40,265 --> 00:10:42,558
Coming around the track...
Come on, Madrid, come on.

80
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:44,685
Inside of the bike, he
skates up in front.

81
00:10:44,686 --> 00:10:46,270
Gonzales still has it for Madrid.

82
00:10:46,271 --> 00:10:48,397
Hands off again,
this time to Bodeas.

83
00:10:48,398 --> 00:10:51,226
Bodeas on offense for
the Madrid team.

84
00:10:51,401 --> 00:10:53,652
Here's the Houston defense
in a four-man defense...

85
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:55,404
Shot! It is cleared.

86
00:10:55,405 --> 00:10:57,239
And out of the pack goes Bodeas,

87
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:00,200
but he's all right, he's not injured,
but his scoring attempt failed.

88
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:03,412
And the score is still
one-to-nothing in favor of Houston.

89
00:11:03,413 --> 00:11:07,291
The ball is fired again. Madrid is
pressing now, putting the pressure on...

90
00:11:07,292 --> 00:11:09,039
Keep it moving!

91
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:14,332
All right, come on, let's move it.

92
00:11:15,466 --> 00:11:17,043
We got it now.

93
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:27,936
Sanchez is moving to
his left and right,

94
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:31,690
has a full head of steam, still going
in on offense, trying to tie the score.

95
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:36,153
Sanchez moves around the bike, takes a
long look and shoots and he scores!

96
00:11:36,154 --> 00:11:40,154
Sanchez scores with a play
that ties the game at 1-1.

97
00:11:40,617 --> 00:11:41,783
Second period.

98
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:45,079
The ball is in play again,
intercepted this time by Haskell.

99
00:11:49,667 --> 00:11:51,540
Three minutes. Get off.

100
00:11:51,794 --> 00:11:53,462
Madrid penalty.

101
00:11:53,463 --> 00:11:58,760
Three minutes, biking misconduct
on number one, Meitzer.

102
00:12:03,806 --> 00:12:07,006
Are you satisfied, Madrid? What kind of
game are you guys playing out there?

103
00:12:19,656 --> 00:12:21,657
Take it easy, take it easy.

104
00:12:21,658 --> 00:12:23,533
You'll be okay.

105
00:12:23,534 --> 00:12:28,706
This crowd's going wild, loving the
wide-open action in this quarterfinal game.

106
00:12:28,707 --> 00:12:29,790
Skate! Skate!

107
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:32,085
Come on, God damn it, skate!

108
00:12:34,963 --> 00:12:37,416
Houston! Houston!

109
00:12:42,345 --> 00:12:44,388
All go down, pileup on the track,

110
00:12:44,389 --> 00:12:47,557
the ball rolls free and into the
gutter. It's a dead ball.

111
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:50,560
Come here, come here!

112
00:12:50,561 --> 00:12:52,729
Come on, block that side.

113
00:12:53,523 --> 00:12:55,396
Come on, move out.

114
00:12:58,361 --> 00:13:00,063
How is it, Jonathan?

115
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:03,323
- Give me a tie, will you, Bo?
- Sure.

116
00:13:07,954 --> 00:13:09,656
Come on, dude!

117
00:13:24,721 --> 00:13:26,054
Three minute penalty. Hey!

118
00:13:27,348 --> 00:13:30,097
Don't give me any of that.
Off the track. Off the track.

119
00:13:39,861 --> 00:13:41,313
Group up.

120
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:43,947
Hold the line! Hold the line!

121
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:47,075
Up and over the Madrid defense,
gets up in front of the goal

122
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:49,779
and he jams it in for the score!

123
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:55,785
Jonathan jams it in and scores to
get Houston a 2-1 lead over Madrid.

124
00:13:56,627 --> 00:13:59,626
Houston with the ball again
here in the third period.

125
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:04,301
Stop it!

126
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:12,934
He has it.

127
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:16,438
Jonathan behind the bike, coming in low with
a great maneuver, he shoots, he scores!

128
00:14:18,441 --> 00:14:20,317
That's the way! You got it!

129
00:14:20,318 --> 00:14:22,778
I love this game,
Moonpie. I love it.

130
00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:23,945
Yeah.

131
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:31,158
So, we've got two games left.

132
00:14:31,204 --> 00:14:33,657
Guess who we play first? Tokyo.

133
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:36,375
Now who would have thought
they'd make it to the playoffs?

134
00:14:36,376 --> 00:14:38,210
They're good.

135
00:14:38,211 --> 00:14:40,295
They've got the old samurai spirit.

136
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:42,089
Yeah, but they're
only about this tall.

137
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:45,300
Yeah, well, two or three little
things make one big thing.

138
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:47,719
They're liable to climb all
over you and eat your lunch.

139
00:14:48,846 --> 00:14:52,220
I can't get on a man-to-man basis
with a pigmy or an oriental.

140
00:14:53,518 --> 00:14:55,186
I don't know what it is.

141
00:15:01,275 --> 00:15:03,853
You were fine tonight, all of you.

142
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:07,531
Mean. Sharp.

143
00:15:07,532 --> 00:15:08,657
Thank you.

144
00:15:08,658 --> 00:15:09,950
Your fellas did well again.

145
00:15:09,951 --> 00:15:11,827
Thank you, Mr. Bartholomew, sir.
Thank you.

146
00:15:11,828 --> 00:15:15,077
You? You rode. You really rode.

147
00:15:15,123 --> 00:15:16,289
Yeah.

148
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:19,000
You play like our champion here.
You take lessons from him?

149
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:21,711
No. We just give lessons
to the other team.

150
00:15:21,712 --> 00:15:23,710
Yeah!

151
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:25,503
How are you, Jonathan?

152
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:29,010
I'm feeling mean, Mr. Bartholomew.
It's good to see you.

153
00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:31,805
Jonathan E. That's the name.

154
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:37,686
Houston players come and go,
but the champion plays on.

155
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:39,646
Yeah!

156
00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:41,648
The corporation has a
hard time, Moonpie,

157
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:44,477
figuring out ways to pay
the champion properly.

158
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:46,987
We can't think up any
more rewards for him.

159
00:15:46,988 --> 00:15:49,573
You'd like us to have that
problem with you, wouldn't you?

160
00:15:49,574 --> 00:15:50,699
Yes, sir.

161
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:56,872
Like Jonathan, you play with abandon,
but this is Jonathan's season.

162
00:15:57,707 --> 00:16:00,125
Every season seems to
be Jonathan's season,

163
00:16:00,126 --> 00:16:03,211
but this year, we've got
you on Multivision.

164
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:06,006
A special show all about you.

165
00:16:07,175 --> 00:16:09,509
No player ever had that before.

166
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:13,131
The whole world will be watching,
because this is your year.

167
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:16,930
You got it, babe.

168
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:21,855
So, two games left.

169
00:16:21,856 --> 00:16:23,231
That's right, Mr. Bartholomew.

170
00:16:23,232 --> 00:16:25,108
New York in the final!

171
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:30,652
Team seems healthy,

172
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:32,908
champion says he feels mean,

173
00:16:34,535 --> 00:16:36,077
no problems here.

174
00:16:39,749 --> 00:16:41,451
What is this, fruit juice?

175
00:16:41,751 --> 00:16:44,545
Very healthy, Mr. Bartholomew,
very healthy.

176
00:16:53,221 --> 00:16:55,219
Sweet dreams, Moonpie.

177
00:16:56,098 --> 00:16:58,551
It's a bad habit you got there.

178
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:02,855
You know what that habit will
make you dream, Moonpie?

179
00:17:03,564 --> 00:17:06,108
You'll dream you're an executive.

180
00:17:06,776 --> 00:17:09,653
And you'll have your hands
on all the controls,

181
00:17:09,654 --> 00:17:13,700
and you'll wear a gray suit,
and you'll make decisions.

182
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:15,572
But you know what, Moonpie?

183
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:21,074
You know what those executives dream
about out there, behind their desks?

184
00:17:21,624 --> 00:17:24,452
They dream they're
great rollerballers.

185
00:17:24,669 --> 00:17:26,711
They dream they're Jonathan.

186
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:30,215
They have muscles,
they bash in faces.

187
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:35,971
Let's go. Can't keep these
boys here all night.

188
00:17:35,972 --> 00:17:38,641
Jonathan, come and see me tomorrow.

189
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:47,524
Quiet, boys, quiet.

190
00:17:47,525 --> 00:17:49,227
This is a great team.

191
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:53,280
A great city. Great stuff
out there tonight.

192
00:18:22,893 --> 00:18:25,312
Jonathan! Jonathan!

193
00:19:37,718 --> 00:19:38,968
- Good morning.
- How are you, sir?

194
00:19:38,969 --> 00:19:40,261
Brutal game last night.

195
00:19:40,262 --> 00:19:41,846
Oh, thank you.

196
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:54,318
Continue to hold my calls,
all right? Thank you.

197
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:18,133
Come in, Jonathan.

198
00:20:18,134 --> 00:20:20,928
Keep silence with me for
a minute, won't you?

199
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:02,803
It's important to have a
place to think things out.

200
00:21:02,887 --> 00:21:07,263
You have your ranch. I know you
take a lot of pleasure in it.

201
00:21:08,017 --> 00:21:10,015
I, uh, cut my finger.

202
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:12,346
I'm sorry. Here.

203
00:21:15,524 --> 00:21:18,068
You've had an amazing
career, Jonathan.

204
00:21:18,652 --> 00:21:22,030
You know how proud we are
of the Houston team,

205
00:21:22,031 --> 00:21:24,734
and what we think
of you, the energy?

206
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:29,409
But now, there are
executives who want you out.

207
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:30,705
Sir?

208
00:21:30,706 --> 00:21:33,416
You've had 10 years in
this game, Jonathan.

209
00:21:33,417 --> 00:21:35,585
Longer than anyone, ever.

210
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:38,588
Retire? How can I do that?

211
00:21:38,589 --> 00:21:40,712
On your special program.

212
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:44,886
There are some who feel that
this program should now be used

213
00:21:44,887 --> 00:21:47,510
to announce your retirement.

214
00:21:48,015 --> 00:21:49,307
Who wants that?

215
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:54,105
When this special was first planned by
RCI Energy, we saw it as a good thing.

216
00:21:55,689 --> 00:21:58,267
Now the executive
directorate wants a change.

217
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:02,109
The program is scheduled, the
whole world is waiting for it,

218
00:22:02,488 --> 00:22:05,908
so this does seem the perfect time.

219
00:22:07,117 --> 00:22:10,787
You know, the team, they,
uh, they depend on me.

220
00:22:10,788 --> 00:22:13,867
Jonathan, let's think
this through together.

221
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:16,911
You know how a game serves us?

222
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:20,464
It has a definite social purpose.

223
00:22:21,131 --> 00:22:24,175
Nations are bankrupt, gone,

224
00:22:24,844 --> 00:22:27,547
none of that tribal
warfare anymore.

225
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:31,475
Even the corporate wars
are a thing of the past.

226
00:22:32,852 --> 00:22:34,269
I know that. It's just...

227
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:37,522
So now, we have the majors
and their executives.

228
00:22:37,523 --> 00:22:40,859
Transport, food, communication,

229
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:43,813
housing, luxury, energy.

230
00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:48,193
A few of us making decisions
on a global basis

231
00:22:48,325 --> 00:22:49,993
for the common good.

232
00:22:49,994 --> 00:22:51,828
The team, is a unit.

233
00:22:51,829 --> 00:22:53,454
It plays with certain rhythms.

234
00:22:53,455 --> 00:22:56,124
So does an executive
team, Jonathan.

235
00:22:56,125 --> 00:23:00,125
Now, everyone has all the
comforts, you know that.

236
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:03,332
No poverty, no sickness,

237
00:23:03,465 --> 00:23:05,713
no needs and many luxuries,

238
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:10,385
which you enjoy just as if you
were in the executive class.

239
00:23:10,472 --> 00:23:14,225
Corporate society takes
care of everything,

240
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:16,311
and all it asks of anyone,

241
00:23:16,312 --> 00:23:19,436
or has ever asked of anyone, ever,

242
00:23:19,815 --> 00:23:22,768
is not to interfere with
management decisions.

243
00:23:23,444 --> 00:23:26,821
I know. I don't mean to resist.

244
00:23:26,822 --> 00:23:28,615
I'm just trying to understand.

245
00:23:28,616 --> 00:23:30,909
This is for your own benefit.

246
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:33,328
You must know that, Jonathan.

247
00:23:33,329 --> 00:23:35,873
All decisions concerning you are.

248
00:23:37,917 --> 00:23:40,711
Well, I, uh, lost Ella.

249
00:23:42,671 --> 00:23:45,423
The corporation took my wife away
because an executive wanted her.

250
00:23:45,424 --> 00:23:47,383
I'm not gonna review
all that again.

251
00:23:47,384 --> 00:23:50,546
It was before I took over here,
and I had nothing to do with it.

252
00:23:50,804 --> 00:23:54,679
And from what I hear, your
wife wanted to leave herself.

253
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:58,054
So, now you're going to retire.

254
00:23:58,854 --> 00:24:01,477
That shouldn't be too hard for you.

255
00:24:01,899 --> 00:24:05,273
It's a stupid game,
after all. Awful game.

256
00:24:06,487 --> 00:24:08,167
You ought to be glad
to be out of it.

257
00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:12,401
I don't...

258
00:24:13,827 --> 00:24:17,031
I don't know, Mr. Bartholomew.
I just don't know.

259
00:24:18,791 --> 00:24:21,209
I realize you had nothing
to do with Ella leaving...

260
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:23,162
- Jonathan, I...
- But, um...

261
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:27,090
You're right.

262
00:24:27,091 --> 00:24:29,419
I mean, I ought to do it.

263
00:24:30,386 --> 00:24:32,387
I ought to be perfectly
happy to do what you say...

264
00:24:32,388 --> 00:24:36,092
Take your time. Take a few days.

265
00:24:36,934 --> 00:24:40,263
You've just come through
a game. You're tired.

266
00:24:40,562 --> 00:24:44,312
Go to your ranch,
but think about it,

267
00:24:44,984 --> 00:24:47,186
and understand it.

268
00:24:48,112 --> 00:24:50,280
Do understand it.

269
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:13,428
Because I don't understand
your resistance,

270
00:25:13,429 --> 00:25:16,382
and I don't think anyone
else will, either.

271
00:26:13,238 --> 00:26:14,530
Was your flight okay?

272
00:26:14,531 --> 00:26:15,656
Yeah. Is Clete here?

273
00:26:15,657 --> 00:26:16,741
He's in the training room.

274
00:26:16,742 --> 00:26:18,865
I'm gonna go say hello.

275
00:26:20,329 --> 00:26:21,781
- Jonathan.
- Hmm?

276
00:26:23,165 --> 00:26:25,208
Look what I got for breakfast.

277
00:26:25,209 --> 00:26:26,292
Hmm?

278
00:26:26,293 --> 00:26:28,711
It's a notice from the corporation.

279
00:26:28,712 --> 00:26:30,789
What's it say?

280
00:26:31,215 --> 00:26:33,838
Oh, that I should get out of here.

281
00:26:33,842 --> 00:26:37,637
You know, go away, vanish.
That kind of thing.

282
00:26:38,514 --> 00:26:39,874
You know anything about that?

283
00:26:41,391 --> 00:26:44,344
Yeah, I kind of heard
something about it.

284
00:26:45,687 --> 00:26:46,979
You knew it was coming.

285
00:26:49,066 --> 00:26:51,519
We've been together six months.

286
00:26:53,612 --> 00:26:56,315
Didn't you even want
to say goodbye?

287
00:26:57,991 --> 00:26:59,909
We'll talk about it later, okay?

288
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:01,862
You didn't, did you?

289
00:27:02,371 --> 00:27:03,618
Hmm?

290
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:08,668
You didn't even want me
here when you got back.

291
00:27:08,669 --> 00:27:10,545
I gotta go see Cletus.

292
00:27:10,546 --> 00:27:12,505
What do you want me to
do in the meantime?

293
00:27:12,506 --> 00:27:14,003
I want you to take it easy.

294
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,001
Uh...

295
00:27:17,136 --> 00:27:20,054
I want you to go in and
fix us something to eat.

296
00:27:20,055 --> 00:27:23,225
Clete's come a long
way and I'm hungry.

297
00:27:23,392 --> 00:27:24,935
All right?

298
00:27:26,103 --> 00:27:27,429
Okay.

299
00:27:32,067 --> 00:27:33,439
Jonathan?

300
00:27:35,696 --> 00:27:37,898
I'm glad you're all right.

301
00:27:52,921 --> 00:27:55,214
Come on. All right, come on.

302
00:27:57,342 --> 00:27:58,794
Come.

303
00:28:03,265 --> 00:28:04,682
I'm tired enough.

304
00:28:04,683 --> 00:28:06,556
Yeah. Uh-huh. Well...

305
00:28:22,492 --> 00:28:24,535
- I caught you, didn't I, baby?
- Huh?

306
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:26,287
- Two games running.
- What?

307
00:28:26,288 --> 00:28:28,164
You did that in the last two games.

308
00:28:28,165 --> 00:28:30,124
Show the forward left.

309
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:32,460
You're standing on your left skate.

310
00:28:32,461 --> 00:28:35,796
Do that in Tokyo, they'll
take your arm home for lunch.

311
00:28:35,797 --> 00:28:37,298
You with me?

312
00:28:37,299 --> 00:28:40,173
Okay.

313
00:28:41,053 --> 00:28:42,553
You practice that a
little for me, huh?

314
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:43,880
All right.

315
00:28:51,146 --> 00:28:54,520
Hell, I forget which
corporation is which.

316
00:28:54,650 --> 00:28:57,194
Any ass knows that fire's energy.

317
00:28:58,487 --> 00:29:03,534
What about the music? Where's
the music come from, huh?

318
00:29:04,826 --> 00:29:06,202
Okay if I have one of these?

319
00:29:06,203 --> 00:29:07,662
Go on, have all of it.

320
00:29:19,925 --> 00:29:23,129
I forget what corporation's
running what city.

321
00:29:25,847 --> 00:29:27,924
Chicago's still a food city,

322
00:29:29,268 --> 00:29:31,562
but what about Indianapolis?

323
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:33,210
Whatever happened to that town?

324
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:35,227
Whatever happened to Mackie?

325
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:39,318
Yeah, things were much
simpler when I was a kid.

326
00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:40,896
We still had three nations.

327
00:29:41,321 --> 00:29:44,448
That was before the corporate
wars, even before rollerball.

328
00:29:44,449 --> 00:29:45,866
Before everything.

329
00:29:46,410 --> 00:29:47,702
You believe in kids?

330
00:29:48,245 --> 00:29:49,870
I remember someone telling me about

331
00:29:49,871 --> 00:29:53,120
the National Football
League and the World Cup.

332
00:29:53,333 --> 00:29:54,417
Where you going?

333
00:29:54,418 --> 00:29:56,086
Indianapolis.

334
00:30:00,716 --> 00:30:02,967
What do you know about
that stuff, Clete?

335
00:30:02,968 --> 00:30:04,545
I mean...

336
00:30:05,137 --> 00:30:09,262
Know how the corporations got
started, about the corporate wars?

337
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:11,676
They were nasty! Whoo!

338
00:30:12,144 --> 00:30:14,186
But nobody talks about that.

339
00:30:14,187 --> 00:30:15,938
Well, except among friends.

340
00:30:15,939 --> 00:30:17,641
Yeah.

341
00:30:18,066 --> 00:30:20,360
I remember your rookie year.

342
00:30:20,736 --> 00:30:23,112
You were mean and tight.

343
00:30:23,113 --> 00:30:25,361
Best player I ever coached.

344
00:30:25,741 --> 00:30:28,615
Nobody could lay a
hand on you that year.

345
00:30:28,702 --> 00:30:30,404
- Remember?
- Yeah.

346
00:30:31,246 --> 00:30:33,247
Look, I... I gotta
ask you something.

347
00:30:33,248 --> 00:30:35,871
It figures. Go ahead.
I'm listening.

348
00:30:36,251 --> 00:30:37,752
Well...

349
00:30:37,753 --> 00:30:40,297
Something going on with the game.

350
00:30:41,548 --> 00:30:45,469
I don't know what it is. I don't
think I'm supposed to know.

351
00:30:45,552 --> 00:30:46,844
What's that?

352
00:30:47,554 --> 00:30:49,552
They want me to quit.

353
00:30:58,315 --> 00:31:01,394
And why would they
want you to do that?

354
00:31:02,069 --> 00:31:03,819
I don't know.

355
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:06,569
That's what I'd like
you to find out.

356
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:08,408
I can try.

357
00:31:08,617 --> 00:31:12,571
Hear just about everything going
on in the game one way or another.

358
00:31:12,662 --> 00:31:14,622
That's what I mean.

359
00:31:14,623 --> 00:31:17,167
I can't think of another
executive who'd tell me a thing.

360
00:31:20,253 --> 00:31:22,421
Well, like I say, I'll...

361
00:31:23,757 --> 00:31:25,209
I'll try.

362
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:28,302
But I don't think there's much I...

363
00:31:28,303 --> 00:31:29,970
Look...

364
00:31:29,971 --> 00:31:31,806
No troubles for
either of us, Clete.

365
00:31:31,807 --> 00:31:33,475
Just find out what you can.

366
00:31:35,268 --> 00:31:38,096
Well, trust me, Jonathan,
you know you can.

367
00:31:38,355 --> 00:31:39,681
Sure.

368
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:42,146
Sit down.

369
00:31:43,318 --> 00:31:45,270
Yeah.

370
00:32:12,514 --> 00:32:14,091
Nice, boys.

371
00:32:17,018 --> 00:32:18,515
Yo, Johnny.

372
00:32:21,398 --> 00:32:23,396
That's the Houston stride.

373
00:32:25,068 --> 00:32:28,654
You boys want to make this team, play for
Houston, you're gonna have to learn it.

374
00:32:28,655 --> 00:32:32,576
We pride ourselves on
being a power team.

375
00:32:32,701 --> 00:32:33,826
That's right.

376
00:32:33,827 --> 00:32:35,786
We're power. We're mean.

377
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:38,038
Now, that doesn't mean to say

378
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:42,209
we'd like to have you hanging back
there on a rail, in a fistfight,

379
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:44,044
just standing there fighting
somebody in section A

380
00:32:44,045 --> 00:32:45,588
when you're supposed
to be in section B.

381
00:32:45,589 --> 00:32:48,757
I'm coming up to score, and you ain't in
the section you're supposed to be in,

382
00:32:48,758 --> 00:32:50,050
don't do us no good.

383
00:32:50,051 --> 00:32:51,218
Right.

384
00:32:51,219 --> 00:32:53,717
Who's the two new catchers here?

385
00:32:54,264 --> 00:32:55,598
Right.

386
00:32:55,599 --> 00:32:57,472
Give me that ball.

387
00:32:59,728 --> 00:33:01,305
Don't, uh.

388
00:33:02,355 --> 00:33:05,149
Stick your hand in
that gutter too quick.

389
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:07,648
Wait till this ball comes
down on the track.

390
00:33:08,904 --> 00:33:12,406
Don't get too anxious. That thing
will take your arm right off.

391
00:33:12,407 --> 00:33:13,950
Now, the bikers.

392
00:33:14,117 --> 00:33:15,660
A biker

393
00:33:17,537 --> 00:33:20,661
might sacrifice a little
three-minute penalty

394
00:33:20,707 --> 00:33:22,875
and run over the top of a skater...

395
00:33:22,876 --> 00:33:24,543
Uh-huh.

396
00:33:24,544 --> 00:33:26,985
If he feels that he's skating
a little too good that day.

397
00:33:27,255 --> 00:33:29,298
So we have a few methods
here in Houston.

398
00:33:29,299 --> 00:33:30,424
There's hundreds.

399
00:33:30,425 --> 00:33:32,551
One, of course, is to
use this shield here.

400
00:33:32,552 --> 00:33:34,929
Use your pads. Use what you got.

401
00:33:34,930 --> 00:33:36,764
Drive that arm in there.

402
00:33:36,765 --> 00:33:38,599
Keep your feet forward.
Hit and move.

403
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:39,683
You get away from the wreck.

404
00:33:39,684 --> 00:33:42,102
Always keep your feet here.
Don't come across in here.

405
00:33:42,103 --> 00:33:44,438
You get all twisted. That's sad.

406
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:46,273
Or if a biker's sitting
up nice and high...

407
00:33:46,274 --> 00:33:47,983
A lot of guys like to ride high.

408
00:33:47,984 --> 00:33:49,360
Drag one off them in there.

409
00:33:49,361 --> 00:33:50,778
I hurt you, Blue?

410
00:33:50,779 --> 00:33:53,232
I wouldn't hurt him for the world.

411
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:55,282
Now, third method,

412
00:33:55,283 --> 00:33:59,324
kind of one that was perfected by a
little friend of mine, the swoop.

413
00:34:01,164 --> 00:34:02,832
Swooper, that's me.

414
00:34:03,208 --> 00:34:05,960
Hang up on the rail, use all
the speed of the track,

415
00:34:05,961 --> 00:34:08,209
come down and drop-kick a biker.

416
00:34:10,966 --> 00:34:13,168
Say, excuse me.

417
00:34:13,677 --> 00:34:16,847
You're not paying a whole
lot of attention, are you?

418
00:34:18,515 --> 00:34:19,875
Hey, what's this dude's name?

419
00:34:20,225 --> 00:34:22,768
That's our new
speedball from Manila.

420
00:34:22,769 --> 00:34:25,017
Yeah, you know.
You know, that's Toughie.

421
00:34:25,522 --> 00:34:26,769
Come on up, Tough.

422
00:34:29,776 --> 00:34:31,068
Always a big honker.

423
00:34:34,364 --> 00:34:36,782
Say, why don't you do me
and the boys a favor,

424
00:34:36,783 --> 00:34:39,702
I mean, since you know
everything there is to know...

425
00:34:39,703 --> 00:34:42,162
We'd sure appreciate it, I want you
to give us a little demonstration.

426
00:34:42,163 --> 00:34:43,789
Show us how you made
that big rep down there.

427
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:47,369
Just skate around and
just take me out, huh?

428
00:34:52,382 --> 00:34:53,629
Go get him, Toughie.

429
00:34:57,012 --> 00:34:59,847
Now, eyes, use them.

430
00:34:59,848 --> 00:35:01,724
Don't lock your eyes
on any one spot.

431
00:35:01,725 --> 00:35:03,183
This game isn't all in the muscle.

432
00:35:03,184 --> 00:35:04,226
Use your head.

433
00:35:04,227 --> 00:35:07,055
Lock your eyes on
the target, keep...

434
00:35:09,691 --> 00:35:12,943
Ears, now, they're
real important, too.

435
00:35:25,957 --> 00:35:29,502
If there's anything I love,
it's luxury centers.

436
00:35:31,796 --> 00:35:35,838
When I get my privilege card,
I know what I'm gonna get me, too.

437
00:35:35,884 --> 00:35:37,051
Secretary.

438
00:35:37,052 --> 00:35:40,220
Why do you want a secretary?
Are you planning on becoming an executive?

439
00:35:40,221 --> 00:35:42,097
I just need one.

440
00:35:42,098 --> 00:35:43,424
About this tall.

441
00:35:44,184 --> 00:35:45,476
Yeah?

442
00:35:46,519 --> 00:35:48,062
Why don't you give it a rest?

443
00:35:55,904 --> 00:35:56,987
Hello.

444
00:35:56,988 --> 00:35:58,072
Can I help you, please?

445
00:35:58,073 --> 00:36:01,241
Yeah, I tried to order some books,
and they sent me this notice

446
00:36:01,242 --> 00:36:03,786
said I had to appear at
the center personally.

447
00:36:03,912 --> 00:36:06,121
That's right. This is
our circulation unit.

448
00:36:06,122 --> 00:36:08,199
You can make your choice
here or by catalog.

449
00:36:09,459 --> 00:36:10,751
There must be some mistake.

450
00:36:10,752 --> 00:36:12,294
The books you've
ordered are classified

451
00:36:12,295 --> 00:36:15,130
and have been transcribed
and summarized.

452
00:36:15,131 --> 00:36:16,378
Well, who summarizes them?

453
00:36:16,424 --> 00:36:19,047
I suppose the computers
summarize them.

454
00:36:19,135 --> 00:36:21,095
What'd you need books for?

455
00:36:21,096 --> 00:36:22,930
Just want to study
up on some things.

456
00:36:22,931 --> 00:36:24,431
You could go to the computer center

457
00:36:24,432 --> 00:36:26,600
where the real librarians
transcribe the books,

458
00:36:26,601 --> 00:36:29,269
but we have all the edited
versions in our catalog.

459
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:30,972
Anything I think you'd want.

460
00:36:31,731 --> 00:36:33,399
Well, let's see then.

461
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:36,820
This is not a library, and you
are really not a librarian.

462
00:36:37,070 --> 00:36:38,612
I'm only a clerk. That's right.

463
00:36:38,613 --> 00:36:40,072
I'm sorry about it really.

464
00:36:40,073 --> 00:36:43,742
And the books are really in
computer banks being summarized.

465
00:36:43,743 --> 00:36:44,910
Where is that?

466
00:36:44,911 --> 00:36:47,121
Well, there's a computer
bank in Washington.

467
00:36:47,122 --> 00:36:49,915
The biggest is in Geneva.
It's a nice place to visit.

468
00:36:49,916 --> 00:36:51,917
- Yeah.
- I guess that's where all the books are now.

469
00:36:51,918 --> 00:36:53,415
Yeah. Well, thank you.

470
00:36:57,132 --> 00:36:59,299
It's not that exactly.

471
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:01,218
Yeah, but books, Jonathan?

472
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:02,845
I mean, anything you want to know,

473
00:37:02,846 --> 00:37:05,264
you could hire yourself a
corporate teacher, see?

474
00:37:05,265 --> 00:37:09,101
I mean, you can call somebody up.
Use your privilege card.

475
00:37:09,102 --> 00:37:11,521
I can't. That's just it.

476
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:16,316
I feel there's something going on.
Somebody's pushing me.

477
00:37:16,317 --> 00:37:18,144
Who? Bartholomew?

478
00:37:19,821 --> 00:37:21,947
But you're Jonathan E.

479
00:37:21,948 --> 00:37:24,992
Everybody knows you.
You've got everything.

480
00:37:25,994 --> 00:37:29,619
You know you'll be treated right.
You always have been.

481
00:37:30,832 --> 00:37:32,624
Yeah. I don't know.

482
00:37:32,625 --> 00:37:34,877
But I do know! We're living good.

483
00:37:34,878 --> 00:37:36,705
You know we are.

484
00:40:22,962 --> 00:40:24,960
I found this to wear.

485
00:40:26,341 --> 00:40:27,667
Is it all right?

486
00:40:30,845 --> 00:40:32,718
That's the uniform of the house.

487
00:40:42,106 --> 00:40:43,683
I'm Daphne.

488
00:40:44,859 --> 00:40:47,733
Yeah. That figures.

489
00:40:51,032 --> 00:40:53,155
Well, that's all right.

490
00:40:54,869 --> 00:40:56,867
Here. Wear these, too.

491
00:41:02,543 --> 00:41:04,336
That's right, no penalties!

492
00:41:04,337 --> 00:41:07,547
Limited substitutions.
You can handle it!

493
00:41:07,548 --> 00:41:09,383
Beat Tokyo!

494
00:41:09,384 --> 00:41:11,218
All we gotta do is
change our tactics.

495
00:41:11,219 --> 00:41:13,095
- That's it.
- Three times...

496
00:41:13,096 --> 00:41:15,722
There's always been rule changes.
Now, look, you know that!

497
00:41:15,723 --> 00:41:18,475
It gets more people to watch the
game. That's all there is to it.

498
00:41:20,311 --> 00:41:22,562
Look, you all signed contracts
to finish out the season,

499
00:41:22,563 --> 00:41:24,856
no matter what the
alterations in the game.

500
00:41:24,857 --> 00:41:27,234
Now every last one of you signed.

501
00:41:27,235 --> 00:41:28,902
See? Now we all signed a contract.

502
00:41:28,903 --> 00:41:31,780
That doesn't matter! There's
no way we're gonna lose,

503
00:41:31,781 --> 00:41:33,323
no matter how they change the game.

504
00:41:33,324 --> 00:41:35,572
That's right. That's right.

505
00:41:36,411 --> 00:41:38,954
All it means is a
change of strategy.

506
00:41:38,955 --> 00:41:41,623
Now, we knock out the bikers early,
we take care of their skaters.

507
00:41:41,624 --> 00:41:44,623
Don't try to score yourselves.
And the game's yours.

508
00:41:44,919 --> 00:41:46,795
Now, you watch
yourselves out there.

509
00:41:46,796 --> 00:41:48,672
They're playing the
same rules we are.

510
00:41:48,673 --> 00:41:52,926
It's gonna be rough, but it's
still basically the same game.

511
00:41:52,927 --> 00:41:55,387
And the team with the power wins.

512
00:41:58,516 --> 00:41:59,968
Come on.

513
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:07,017
Hey, Rusty.

514
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:09,526
Hey, wait. Wait a minute.

515
00:42:09,527 --> 00:42:10,944
Hey, Rusty, come on.

516
00:42:10,945 --> 00:42:12,647
Listen.

517
00:42:13,114 --> 00:42:15,487
You were talking about
them contracts.

518
00:42:16,075 --> 00:42:19,494
How come everyone else is being asked
to play with the no-penalty rule,

519
00:42:19,495 --> 00:42:21,993
and they're pressuring me to quit?

520
00:42:23,416 --> 00:42:25,084
I don't know.

521
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:30,293
But can't you do what you're told?

522
00:42:30,673 --> 00:42:32,500
For your own good, get out.

523
00:42:32,967 --> 00:42:34,419
I...

524
00:42:36,137 --> 00:42:37,804
I don't want to leave
the guys to play Tokyo

525
00:42:37,805 --> 00:42:39,097
with the rules breaking
down. I mean...

526
00:42:39,098 --> 00:42:42,017
Jonathan, it doesn't
matter what you want!

527
00:42:45,855 --> 00:42:47,682
Think about that.

528
00:42:57,658 --> 00:42:59,743
These we did in slow motion

529
00:42:59,744 --> 00:43:02,788
to show the impact of your
blows on opposing players.

530
00:43:03,456 --> 00:43:04,664
Yeah, fine.

531
00:43:04,665 --> 00:43:07,459
We want you to approve
the sequences.

532
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:09,037
It's, uh...

533
00:43:09,295 --> 00:43:11,589
It's all fine with me.

534
00:43:12,006 --> 00:43:13,207
Anything.

535
00:43:13,633 --> 00:43:16,468
I really don't see
why I'm needed here.

536
00:43:16,469 --> 00:43:19,304
Well, the Energy people
want you to be satisfied.

537
00:43:19,305 --> 00:43:20,388
Huh.

538
00:43:20,389 --> 00:43:23,433
There, now, isn't that
a marvelous shot?

539
00:43:25,061 --> 00:43:26,228
Sure.

540
00:43:26,229 --> 00:43:29,899
I'm a stat freak myself.
Isn't that perverse?

541
00:43:30,525 --> 00:43:31,897
You got anything I can take?

542
00:43:34,028 --> 00:43:36,105
Just... Just take one.

543
00:43:37,698 --> 00:43:39,032
Statistics, huh?

544
00:43:39,033 --> 00:43:43,078
Yes, the greatest number of points
scored in a single game, 18.

545
00:43:43,079 --> 00:43:45,997
The highest velocity of a ball
when actually fielded by a skater,

546
00:43:45,998 --> 00:43:47,958
120 miles per hour.

547
00:43:47,959 --> 00:43:49,376
Most deaths...

548
00:43:50,503 --> 00:43:52,797
Please, don't do that.

549
00:43:53,631 --> 00:43:55,048
Oh.

550
00:43:55,049 --> 00:43:59,511
Most deaths, nine. Rome versus
Pittsburgh. December, last year.

551
00:43:59,512 --> 00:44:01,721
The greatest number of
players and substitutes

552
00:44:01,722 --> 00:44:06,268
put out of action by a single
player in a single game, 13.

553
00:44:06,269 --> 00:44:09,439
A world's record, courtesy
of your dear self.

554
00:44:09,772 --> 00:44:12,774
There have been studies, you know,
of stat freaks in rollerball.

555
00:44:12,775 --> 00:44:14,192
Well, some go to the track,

556
00:44:14,193 --> 00:44:16,570
but they never take their
eyes off the big board.

557
00:44:16,571 --> 00:44:18,071
What's this?

558
00:44:18,072 --> 00:44:19,614
As for myself, I've always wondered

559
00:44:19,615 --> 00:44:22,944
if a rollerball player sees
himself as a class apart.

560
00:44:23,077 --> 00:44:25,371
"Hello. Pause.

561
00:44:27,331 --> 00:44:30,034
"I'm Jonathan E. Smile.

562
00:44:32,003 --> 00:44:35,753
"I would like..." Is this for me?

563
00:44:35,756 --> 00:44:38,425
Very astute, yes.

564
00:44:38,426 --> 00:44:41,049
It's your retirement announcement.

565
00:44:41,762 --> 00:44:45,056
Your special is already scheduled
and announced all over the world.

566
00:44:45,057 --> 00:44:48,227
You're supposed to read this
as part of the program.

567
00:44:48,936 --> 00:44:50,558
What sort of pill did you give me?

568
00:44:50,730 --> 00:44:53,558
Pure aphrodisiac, Daph.
Enjoy yourself, dear.

569
00:44:53,733 --> 00:44:56,568
Can we finish up there and go home?

570
00:44:56,569 --> 00:44:58,945
You are being recorded.

571
00:44:58,946 --> 00:45:01,781
Feeling a little woozy, are you?
Try to read the announcement.

572
00:45:01,782 --> 00:45:03,484
I'm all right.

573
00:45:04,952 --> 00:45:08,455
Why don't you read... the...

574
00:45:08,456 --> 00:45:10,954
Oh, you... You want that, do you?

575
00:45:11,626 --> 00:45:13,376
You are making things
very difficult...

576
00:45:13,377 --> 00:45:16,797
How many... How many
assignments you been on, Daph?

577
00:45:18,132 --> 00:45:20,842
I know you're good at
what you're good at,

578
00:45:20,843 --> 00:45:22,966
so, you must have been around some.

579
00:45:23,387 --> 00:45:25,805
A lot of girls have stayed
with me but you know that.

580
00:45:25,806 --> 00:45:27,758
Never seem to mind.

581
00:45:28,851 --> 00:45:33,147
But odd thoughts I've had about
you, Daph, odd thoughts.

582
00:45:33,481 --> 00:45:35,558
I wondered if you'd
been briefed on me.

583
00:45:35,650 --> 00:45:37,147
I'm going to have to
ask you to read...

584
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:39,819
Yeah, a lot of things occurred
to me, Daph, a lot of things.

585
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:41,180
A lot of things occur to you?

586
00:45:44,075 --> 00:45:45,948
You look terrible.

587
00:45:46,494 --> 00:45:48,492
You do look terrible.

588
00:45:49,330 --> 00:45:50,782
Come on.

589
00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:57,671
See, you shouldn't take anything
offered to you just like that.

590
00:45:57,672 --> 00:45:59,419
What was in it?

591
00:45:59,757 --> 00:46:01,633
Nothing to hurt you.

592
00:46:01,634 --> 00:46:04,344
Maybe you're just a little too trusting.
You ever think of that?

593
00:46:27,660 --> 00:46:29,533
And hook 'em deep now!

594
00:46:45,177 --> 00:46:46,469
I'll do that.

595
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:48,013
Thank you.

596
00:46:54,895 --> 00:46:58,065
As you know, the Tokyo
game is coming up.

597
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:00,942
And you'll remember
that the Tokyo team

598
00:47:00,943 --> 00:47:04,989
uses various karate and
hapkido techniques.

599
00:47:06,407 --> 00:47:08,700
We will review these techniques

600
00:47:08,701 --> 00:47:11,119
with special attention to
the use of death blows.

601
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:12,787
Same lecture every year.

602
00:47:15,041 --> 00:47:17,460
There are certain body areas

603
00:47:18,419 --> 00:47:20,667
that the skilled opponent
will endeavor to strike...

604
00:47:20,755 --> 00:47:22,297
What we got for our
skilled opponents

605
00:47:22,298 --> 00:47:24,424
is the old Houston
fist-in-the-face technique.

606
00:47:24,425 --> 00:47:25,550
Right?

607
00:47:27,011 --> 00:47:29,213
Especially in a game
with no penalties...

608
00:47:29,263 --> 00:47:31,556
You got to get mad,
all right? Play hard!

609
00:47:31,557 --> 00:47:33,600
It don't matter that they're all
tiny little men on that team.

610
00:47:33,601 --> 00:47:38,022
Especially in a game with no
penalties and limited substitution.

611
00:47:38,105 --> 00:47:39,978
Get mad and fly!

612
00:47:40,858 --> 00:47:42,025
Please...

613
00:47:42,026 --> 00:47:44,611
Now, there's certain body
areas that I know about, too.

614
00:47:44,612 --> 00:47:47,190
Now, what we gotta do is hit
those guys in the ganglion.

615
00:47:47,406 --> 00:47:48,531
Where?

616
00:47:48,532 --> 00:47:49,616
In the ganglion.

617
00:47:49,617 --> 00:47:51,618
It's a mess of nerves
right here under the ear.

618
00:47:51,619 --> 00:47:54,913
Now, what you gotta do is drive the
jawbone up in that mess of nerves

619
00:47:54,914 --> 00:47:56,115
and it rings a bell.

620
00:47:57,625 --> 00:47:59,668
You must understand.

621
00:48:00,461 --> 00:48:03,880
The Tokyo team has a very
eccentric playing style.

622
00:48:03,881 --> 00:48:05,131
And no penalties, all right?

623
00:48:05,132 --> 00:48:06,966
If I go down, I know
my team is with me!

624
00:48:06,967 --> 00:48:08,635
- Right?
- Please...

625
00:48:08,636 --> 00:48:09,837
Brute speed!

626
00:48:09,929 --> 00:48:13,473
Familiarize yourself with the
basic fighting art techniques.

627
00:48:13,474 --> 00:48:15,975
And nobody is gonna take
us, rules or no rules!

628
00:48:15,976 --> 00:48:17,143
Go on. Go on.

629
00:48:17,144 --> 00:48:19,096
This is the Houston team!

630
00:48:19,271 --> 00:48:20,480
Rules or no rules!

631
00:48:20,481 --> 00:48:22,103
We fight for each other!

632
00:48:22,149 --> 00:48:24,351
Houston! Houston!

633
00:49:34,847 --> 00:49:38,927
They're really quite beautiful
in a wild kind of way.

634
00:49:39,351 --> 00:49:41,352
I can almost smell the lions.

635
00:49:41,353 --> 00:49:43,772
Don't be silly.
They're made in Detroit.

636
00:49:44,064 --> 00:49:46,274
Yes, they're androids.
They're all programmed.

637
00:49:46,275 --> 00:49:48,776
That's right. The whole
game is played by robots.

638
00:49:48,777 --> 00:49:50,945
They look like men, and they...

639
00:49:51,739 --> 00:49:54,158
Not so loud. They'll hear you.

640
00:49:56,243 --> 00:49:58,661
It'll ensure stability,
expansion and high profits

641
00:49:58,662 --> 00:50:00,538
for the planetary enterprise.

642
00:50:00,539 --> 00:50:01,748
What do you think about it?

643
00:50:01,749 --> 00:50:04,918
Exciting. You make it sound
absolutely romantic.

644
00:50:04,919 --> 00:50:08,254
He's gorgeous. Absolutely gorgeous.

645
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:10,298
I know and he's so intelligent.

646
00:50:10,299 --> 00:50:12,383
We're practically
living on krypens.

647
00:50:16,388 --> 00:50:18,135
Hey, there he is.

648
00:50:18,224 --> 00:50:20,600
Hey, Johnny boy. Hey, kid!

649
00:50:22,811 --> 00:50:25,480
Come on, well,
let's hear it! Come on.

650
00:50:46,961 --> 00:50:48,586
Give me a hand here.
Give me a hand, will you?

651
00:50:48,587 --> 00:50:50,380
Behave yourself.

652
00:51:12,987 --> 00:51:14,689
Hello, Mackie.

653
00:51:16,532 --> 00:51:18,484
Well, how you been?

654
00:51:20,202 --> 00:51:22,621
You know, it's your night
tonight, Jonathan.

655
00:51:22,913 --> 00:51:24,581
You having a good time?

656
00:51:24,582 --> 00:51:25,999
Well...

657
00:51:26,667 --> 00:51:28,119
Well, I'm glad you're here.

658
00:51:29,128 --> 00:51:31,376
I'm here with an executive.

659
00:51:34,133 --> 00:51:36,210
He asked all about you.

660
00:51:38,220 --> 00:51:40,422
He wanted to know if I enjoyed you.

661
00:51:57,781 --> 00:51:58,990
Hey, Rocky.

662
00:51:58,991 --> 00:52:00,658
Hey, come here and give me a hand.

663
00:52:00,659 --> 00:52:03,157
Get on over here.
There's too many of them.

664
00:52:04,788 --> 00:52:06,372
Well, what about the new game?

665
00:52:06,373 --> 00:52:08,207
Actually, I haven't
heard much about it.

666
00:52:08,208 --> 00:52:10,001
The rule changes were
announced a week ago.

667
00:52:10,002 --> 00:52:12,045
- That so?
- Who changed them?

668
00:52:12,046 --> 00:52:13,588
That's what I've been
trying to find out.

669
00:52:13,589 --> 00:52:15,923
Look, rules or no rules,
it's still the same game.

670
00:52:15,924 --> 00:52:18,092
What I'm really looking
forward to is the program.

671
00:52:18,093 --> 00:52:20,219
When you see that screen
replay afterwards...

672
00:52:20,220 --> 00:52:21,471
Excuse me.

673
00:53:20,698 --> 00:53:21,781
Did you hear about Evans?

674
00:53:21,782 --> 00:53:22,907
What?

675
00:53:22,908 --> 00:53:24,781
He's out. Gone.

676
00:53:25,411 --> 00:53:26,988
No kidding.

677
00:53:27,162 --> 00:53:28,784
The old man?

678
00:53:29,123 --> 00:53:30,745
Who got him?

679
00:53:31,291 --> 00:53:33,914
- What?
- I said who got him?

680
00:53:34,545 --> 00:53:36,247
The Crocodile.

681
00:53:48,434 --> 00:53:49,600
Hey. do you like poetry?

682
00:53:49,601 --> 00:53:51,053
Mmm-hmm.

683
00:53:51,645 --> 00:53:53,354
Let's go upstairs?
I got a poem for you.

684
00:53:53,355 --> 00:53:54,556
Ooh.

685
00:54:11,331 --> 00:54:14,167
Welcome, sports
enthusiasts everywhere.

686
00:54:14,168 --> 00:54:16,169
Tonight, Multivision
trains its cameras

687
00:54:16,170 --> 00:54:18,998
on the amazing career
of Jonathan E.

688
00:54:19,548 --> 00:54:22,175
In those years that Houston
began to mold itself

689
00:54:22,176 --> 00:54:25,303
into a world championship team with the
attacking style of their lead scorer...

690
00:54:25,304 --> 00:54:26,846
Jonathan, come on.
Come on, come on.

691
00:54:26,847 --> 00:54:30,597
Jonathan E., has always been
the team's strongest asset.

692
00:54:30,642 --> 00:54:34,187
Yes, the game seems
invented for him.

693
00:56:18,208 --> 00:56:20,251
Defense! Defense!

694
00:56:20,252 --> 00:56:23,672
Defense! Defense! Defense! Defense!

695
00:56:48,989 --> 00:56:50,156
Right on!

696
00:57:16,892 --> 00:57:18,809
Look, I talked to
everybody I could.

697
00:57:18,810 --> 00:57:21,187
And there is something going on.

698
00:57:21,188 --> 00:57:23,272
Yeah, you... You're
right about that.

699
00:57:23,273 --> 00:57:26,226
Nobody will talk about it.
I mean nobody!

700
00:57:26,485 --> 00:57:29,946
It's hard finding anything out,
Jonathan. You know that.

701
00:57:29,947 --> 00:57:34,860
Hell, nobody even knows the names of
the men on the directorate anymore.

702
00:57:40,707 --> 00:57:42,750
Look, I'm sorry, I...

703
00:57:46,213 --> 00:57:47,880
They want you out. You know that.

704
00:57:47,881 --> 00:57:49,173
Yeah.

705
00:57:49,925 --> 00:57:52,378
Well, do you know who they are?

706
00:57:53,470 --> 00:57:54,595
Bartholomew, I guess.

707
00:57:54,596 --> 00:57:56,013
Mmm-mmm.

708
00:57:56,223 --> 00:57:58,096
Above Bartholomew.

709
00:57:58,600 --> 00:58:00,302
It's the Executive Directorate.

710
00:58:01,311 --> 00:58:02,937
Why are they worried about me?

711
00:58:02,938 --> 00:58:04,105
It's what they do.

712
00:58:04,106 --> 00:58:05,356
They're even after the old man

713
00:58:05,357 --> 00:58:08,026
because he didn't get your
retirement announced tonight.

714
00:58:09,236 --> 00:58:11,237
How come they put the
program on without it?

715
00:58:11,238 --> 00:58:15,113
I think they had to. They didn't
want to. It's very tricky.

716
00:58:17,577 --> 00:58:21,577
Jonathan, look... There's one
thing you ought to know.

717
00:58:22,457 --> 00:58:24,580
Look, nobody said it,

718
00:58:24,668 --> 00:58:26,461
but I'm sure of it.

719
00:58:26,670 --> 00:58:27,871
Hmm.

720
00:58:31,049 --> 00:58:33,547
They're afraid of you, Jonathan.

721
00:58:34,428 --> 00:58:36,972
All the way to the top, they are.

722
00:58:49,609 --> 00:58:52,062
What are they afraid of me for?

723
00:59:10,797 --> 00:59:13,295
Oh, no. Don't go yet.
We're showing some replays.

724
00:59:13,383 --> 00:59:15,301
Well, let's see 'em then.
Let's see 'em.

725
01:00:11,608 --> 01:00:14,982
Mr. Bartholomew would like to see
you now. He's in the study.

726
01:00:40,804 --> 01:00:42,426
Come on hurry up. Over there.

727
01:00:52,149 --> 01:00:55,819
You know I've always considered
your situation, Jonathan.

728
01:00:56,027 --> 01:00:57,774
And your needs.

729
01:00:58,321 --> 01:01:00,774
Now, you have to consider mine.

730
01:01:01,241 --> 01:01:02,738
And ours.

731
01:01:02,784 --> 01:01:04,743
I'm considering it,
Mr. Bartholomew.

732
01:01:04,744 --> 01:01:07,743
No player is greater
than the game itself.

733
01:01:08,039 --> 01:01:10,666
It's a significant game
in a number of ways.

734
01:01:10,667 --> 01:01:14,750
The velocities of the ball, the
awful physics of the track.

735
01:01:14,754 --> 01:01:19,209
In the middle of it all, men,
playing by an odd set of rules.

736
01:01:19,551 --> 01:01:23,301
It's not a game men are supposed
to grow strong in, Jonathan.

737
01:01:23,763 --> 01:01:25,681
You appreciate that, don't you?

738
01:01:25,682 --> 01:01:27,600
More and more, Mr. Bartholomew.

739
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:36,894
Shoot that statue.
That's the one. Shoot that!

740
01:01:37,777 --> 01:01:38,944
Hey...

741
01:01:38,945 --> 01:01:41,022
- The tree!
- Yeah! Come on!

742
01:01:42,490 --> 01:01:44,738
You must take good advice.

743
01:01:45,035 --> 01:01:49,206
You're not to play against
Tokyo, you're not to play again.

744
01:01:50,665 --> 01:01:51,957
I want some concessions.

745
01:01:51,958 --> 01:01:53,410
Concessions!

746
01:01:53,460 --> 01:01:56,045
Believe me, I'd be happy
to talk a deal, Jonathan.

747
01:01:56,046 --> 01:01:57,498
I love deals.

748
01:01:57,631 --> 01:02:01,256
But this situation is
much, much simpler.

749
01:02:01,301 --> 01:02:04,846
This Multivision event tonight
was very embarrassing.

750
01:02:05,055 --> 01:02:07,097
For me and for others.

751
01:02:07,098 --> 01:02:08,515
Well...

752
01:02:09,768 --> 01:02:14,272
it might be I won't ever find out why
I've been asked to leave the game.

753
01:02:14,814 --> 01:02:18,518
But I do know I can get some
concessions and I want them.

754
01:02:29,579 --> 01:02:30,826
Oh, you missed!

755
01:02:32,666 --> 01:02:35,119
I want to see Ella. My wife.

756
01:02:35,877 --> 01:02:37,545
Arrange it so I can see her again.

757
01:02:37,629 --> 01:02:39,380
That's not easy, Jonathan.

758
01:02:39,381 --> 01:02:42,585
I want other concessions,
too, Mr. Bartholomew.

759
01:02:52,060 --> 01:02:55,437
Oh! Oh-ho! Look at that!

760
01:02:55,438 --> 01:02:56,855
Give...

761
01:03:08,868 --> 01:03:11,412
By my life, that's incredible!

762
01:03:13,248 --> 01:03:15,207
- Oh!
- That's terrific.

763
01:03:15,208 --> 01:03:16,785
Look at all those flames!

764
01:03:16,793 --> 01:03:18,585
Specifically, you're bargaining

765
01:03:18,586 --> 01:03:22,131
for the right to stay in a
horrible social spectacle.

766
01:03:22,382 --> 01:03:26,758
It has its purposes, and you've
served those purposes brilliantly.

767
01:03:27,137 --> 01:03:29,135
Why argue when you can quit?

768
01:03:29,556 --> 01:03:32,933
And you say you want to know
why decisions are made.

769
01:03:32,934 --> 01:03:35,387
Your future comfort is assured.

770
01:03:35,395 --> 01:03:37,313
You don't need to know.

771
01:03:37,314 --> 01:03:41,644
Why argue about decisions you're not
powerful enough to make for yourself?

772
01:03:48,533 --> 01:03:51,202
Energy will treat you well.
You know that.

773
01:04:00,086 --> 01:04:03,665
If the rule changes stay
the same, Mr. Bartholomew,

774
01:04:05,258 --> 01:04:06,842
I'm playing with my team.

775
01:04:06,843 --> 01:04:10,262
Too late. The rule change is
scheduled and announced.

776
01:04:10,263 --> 01:04:12,723
There's no going back.
You've seen to that.

777
01:04:12,724 --> 01:04:14,221
Then I'll see you in Tokyo.

778
01:04:16,102 --> 01:04:18,437
You can be made to quit.
You can be forced.

779
01:04:18,438 --> 01:04:19,935
You can't make me quit.

780
01:04:19,939 --> 01:04:21,186
Hey, watch out!

781
01:04:21,941 --> 01:04:24,985
Don't tell me I can't.
Don't ever say that!

782
01:04:24,986 --> 01:04:26,445
I can!

783
01:04:26,446 --> 01:04:28,444
You can be stopped!

784
01:04:28,698 --> 01:04:32,698
Jonathan! Jonathan!
Jonathan! Jonathan!

785
01:04:58,853 --> 01:05:00,354
Look, it's all going too fast.

786
01:05:00,355 --> 01:05:01,647
I'm not packed yet. Can't you...

787
01:05:01,648 --> 01:05:03,023
Forget it. You're not going, Daph.

788
01:05:03,024 --> 01:05:04,775
Those bags are ready.
Here. Hold on.

789
01:05:04,776 --> 01:05:07,653
Take this extra hat, will you?
Sir? I've had a call.

790
01:05:07,654 --> 01:05:09,154
I've been asked to
go over to Energy.

791
01:05:09,155 --> 01:05:11,532
You're not going to Tokyo then?
What do you mean I'm not going?

792
01:05:11,533 --> 01:05:14,053
I suppose I will later. I hope
this isn't an inconvenience.

793
01:05:15,328 --> 01:05:17,530
No. No. It's... No problem.

794
01:05:18,915 --> 01:05:21,209
I'm supposed to go with you.

795
01:05:21,876 --> 01:05:23,999
Well, what's that mean?

796
01:05:26,047 --> 01:05:29,758
Who... Who told you you're
supposed to go with me? Hmm?

797
01:05:29,759 --> 01:05:31,506
Nobody told me.

798
01:05:34,013 --> 01:05:35,973
Listen, Jonathan, I really
want to go with you.

799
01:05:35,974 --> 01:05:37,551
I do, really.

800
01:05:38,059 --> 01:05:39,806
You'll need me.

801
01:05:39,811 --> 01:05:43,311
Just get yourself another
assignment, will you, Daph?

802
01:05:43,356 --> 01:05:46,024
Everybody is an assignment.
Life's an assignment.

803
01:05:46,025 --> 01:05:47,602
Here you go.

804
01:05:51,364 --> 01:05:54,738
You'd better do as you're told,
Jonathan. That's all I have to say.

805
01:05:56,035 --> 01:05:57,953
You threatening me?

806
01:05:59,372 --> 01:06:01,040
Don't be here when I come back.

807
01:06:01,291 --> 01:06:02,913
You won't be back, Johnny boy...

808
01:06:05,170 --> 01:06:07,379
Don't try to frighten me,
Daphne. You don't know how.

809
01:06:07,380 --> 01:06:09,214
Look...

810
01:06:09,215 --> 01:06:13,545
You go tell them people that I'm
going to Tokyo and you're not, huh?

811
01:06:13,887 --> 01:06:15,680
- You tell 'em.
- No!

812
01:06:16,389 --> 01:06:17,514
Ciao.

813
01:06:34,699 --> 01:06:36,116
Teller.

814
01:06:42,207 --> 01:06:45,377
Make sure my gear gets
to the track in Tokyo.

815
01:06:45,877 --> 01:06:50,248
I'm gonna travel with the team this trip.
You call transportation and tell them.

816
01:06:50,465 --> 01:06:51,962
Yes, sir.

817
01:07:09,192 --> 01:07:12,737
Jonathan! Jonathan! Jonathan!

818
01:07:20,954 --> 01:07:23,664
What chance does Houston have
of defeating Tokyo tonight?

819
01:07:23,665 --> 01:07:28,627
Well, both teams have fine
players and different styles.

820
01:07:28,628 --> 01:07:29,795
What do you say, Moonpie?

821
01:07:29,796 --> 01:07:30,921
Well, yeah, yeah, but...

822
01:07:30,922 --> 01:07:32,464
But it's not an even match, see.

823
01:07:32,465 --> 01:07:34,800
'Cause the Tokyo team has all
these little short guys.

824
01:07:37,845 --> 01:07:40,264
Tokyo! Tokyo!

825
01:07:40,431 --> 01:07:43,009
Tokyo! Tokyo!

826
01:07:44,227 --> 01:07:46,478
What about the rule changes?

827
01:07:46,479 --> 01:07:47,851
Well...

828
01:07:48,106 --> 01:07:50,732
At Houston, we kind of
play a wide-open system.

829
01:07:50,733 --> 01:07:53,151
Will you comment, though,
about playing in a game

830
01:07:53,152 --> 01:07:56,530
where the rules are always changing?
Game's always had rule changes.

831
01:07:56,531 --> 01:07:58,991
They don't affect the good teams.
You're a great new player.

832
01:07:58,992 --> 01:08:01,159
What's the secret of your
success on the track?

833
01:08:01,160 --> 01:08:03,328
Oh, it's no secret.
I just imitate him.

834
01:08:03,329 --> 01:08:05,455
And plastic surgery
keeps me beautiful.

835
01:08:06,833 --> 01:08:09,334
There are rumors that the
last game of the season

836
01:08:09,335 --> 01:08:11,628
will be played without time limit.

837
01:08:11,629 --> 01:08:13,297
Any comments?

838
01:08:13,965 --> 01:08:16,425
Well, I don't think it'll come
to that. It's still a game.

839
01:08:16,426 --> 01:08:19,254
There also are rumors, some say
you're retiring from the game.

840
01:08:19,512 --> 01:08:20,804
Here I am.

841
01:08:20,805 --> 01:08:23,223
Jonathan! Jonathan!

842
01:08:23,224 --> 01:08:27,349
Jonathan! Jonathan! Jonathan!

843
01:08:27,353 --> 01:08:31,148
Corporate society was
an inevitable destiny.

844
01:08:31,649 --> 01:08:33,734
A material dream world.

845
01:08:33,735 --> 01:08:37,235
Everything man touched
became attainable.

846
01:08:37,905 --> 01:08:40,574
Yeah. I've been
touched all my life.

847
01:08:40,575 --> 01:08:42,573
One way or the other.

848
01:08:43,077 --> 01:08:46,156
Either caressed or hit.

849
01:08:49,083 --> 01:08:51,331
It don't like seem to
matter which anymore.

850
01:08:53,755 --> 01:08:56,754
I guess that's why I
wanna see Ella again.

851
01:08:57,050 --> 01:08:59,469
See if I still feel things now.

852
01:09:01,095 --> 01:09:03,093
You know what I mean?

853
01:09:05,725 --> 01:09:07,142
Yeah...

854
01:09:31,042 --> 01:09:33,540
Here are some other things, too.

855
01:09:36,547 --> 01:09:39,250
I mean, they took
Ella away from me.

856
01:09:42,428 --> 01:09:45,051
Now, they're trying to push me out.

857
01:09:48,101 --> 01:09:50,724
And I'd sure like to find out why.

858
01:09:57,068 --> 01:10:00,363
I think I'll go to one of
them computer centers.

859
01:10:00,947 --> 01:10:03,115
See what I can find out.

860
01:10:04,617 --> 01:10:06,034
Yeah.

861
01:10:07,704 --> 01:10:10,157
Finding out things, it's...

862
01:10:11,624 --> 01:10:13,826
That's the thing, Moonpie.

863
01:10:19,841 --> 01:10:22,676
Jonathan! Jonathan!

864
01:10:22,677 --> 01:10:25,637
Jonathan! Jonathan!

865
01:10:25,638 --> 01:10:28,887
Jonathan! Jonathan!

866
01:10:39,861 --> 01:10:41,653
Hello, everyone, and
welcome to Tokyo.

867
01:10:41,654 --> 01:10:43,780
And tonight's dramatic
semifinal match

868
01:10:43,781 --> 01:10:47,117
for the World's Rollerball
Championship between host Tokyo

869
01:10:47,118 --> 01:10:50,036
and the high-flying defending
champions from Houston.

870
01:10:50,037 --> 01:10:53,165
Late rule changes tonight
will be no penalties called,

871
01:10:53,166 --> 01:10:55,789
and there is limited substitution.

872
01:10:56,961 --> 01:10:58,295
Ladies and gentlemen,

873
01:10:58,296 --> 01:11:02,751
will you stand, please, for the
playing of our corporate hymn.

874
01:12:39,522 --> 01:12:42,350
Tokyo! Tokyo!

875
01:12:47,738 --> 01:12:52,159
Game controller for tonight's
game, C. C. Nakamura.

876
01:12:52,285 --> 01:12:53,577
You all right?

877
01:12:53,578 --> 01:12:55,620
Yeah, I'm all right.

878
01:12:55,621 --> 01:12:58,290
Just wanna get out there and
hit them little fellas.

879
01:12:59,917 --> 01:13:02,252
Listen, stay close now, all right?

880
01:13:02,253 --> 01:13:03,461
Yeah.

881
01:13:03,462 --> 01:13:05,714
Okay, Johnny, let's go! Let's go!

882
01:13:05,715 --> 01:13:08,466
Attention. Your attention, please.

883
01:13:08,467 --> 01:13:11,011
Rule changes for tonight's game.

884
01:13:11,304 --> 01:13:15,008
Limited substitution
and no penalties.

885
01:13:15,641 --> 01:13:20,187
Jonathan! Jonathan! Jonathan!

886
01:13:20,563 --> 01:13:23,398
Tokyo! Victory!

887
01:13:23,399 --> 01:13:27,569
Tokyo! Victory! Tokyo! Victory!

888
01:13:27,570 --> 01:13:31,650
Tokyo! Victory! Tokyo! Victory!

889
01:13:53,429 --> 01:13:54,763
The controller checks the computer.

890
01:13:54,764 --> 01:13:58,683
Ready to fire the first ball, and the first
ball is fired. The game is underway!

891
01:13:58,684 --> 01:14:02,896
Remember again, there'll be no penalties
called tonight and limited substitutions.

892
01:14:02,897 --> 01:14:06,977
This promises to be a punishing
game for both teams tonight.

893
01:14:11,822 --> 01:14:13,569
- Here they come!
- Let's wrap around.

894
01:14:20,373 --> 01:14:22,374
Spread! Spread around!

895
01:14:22,375 --> 01:14:23,952
All right, boys. Go ahead.

896
01:14:26,587 --> 01:14:28,130
Watch out!

897
01:14:32,051 --> 01:14:34,094
Stick him! Stick him!

898
01:14:35,221 --> 01:14:37,389
Tokyo! Victory!

899
01:14:37,390 --> 01:14:39,183
Stay close, now, stay close.

900
01:14:46,232 --> 01:14:47,934
Stick with him!

901
01:14:54,824 --> 01:14:56,571
Take it! Take it in!

902
01:14:58,411 --> 01:14:59,954
Go! Go! Go!

903
01:15:02,748 --> 01:15:04,207
It's a scramble in
front of the goal.

904
01:15:04,208 --> 01:15:06,751
They all go down. Kogo
won it, and he scores!

905
01:15:08,129 --> 01:15:12,007
Kogo scores, shooting from his kneeling
position in front of the goal.

906
01:15:12,008 --> 01:15:15,462
And Tokyo takes a one-to-nothing
lead over Houston.

907
01:15:16,303 --> 01:15:19,473
Tokyo! Victory! Tokyo! Victory!

908
01:15:20,141 --> 01:15:22,058
With Tokyo leading one to nothing.

909
01:15:22,059 --> 01:15:24,894
Houston being pressured by
the fastest opening game.

910
01:15:24,895 --> 01:15:27,097
The second ball is fired.

911
01:15:36,532 --> 01:15:37,699
Spread.

912
01:15:37,700 --> 01:15:38,901
Look out!

913
01:15:40,995 --> 01:15:42,572
Spread out!

914
01:15:42,705 --> 01:15:44,122
Tight defense!

915
01:15:44,123 --> 01:15:45,950
Move ahead, Pete!

916
01:15:46,292 --> 01:15:47,709
Move it.

917
01:15:47,793 --> 01:15:51,129
No doubt the faster tactics
of the Tokyo team.

918
01:15:51,130 --> 01:15:55,008
And now, Houston, their bikers
and skaters form a wall.

919
01:15:55,009 --> 01:15:57,462
Tokyo! Victory!

920
01:16:01,557 --> 01:16:03,600
- Hold 'em. Fast now.
- Pull out their hair.

921
01:16:03,601 --> 01:16:05,852
Move it!

922
01:16:05,853 --> 01:16:06,936
Watch the ball!

923
01:16:06,937 --> 01:16:08,021
Jam them out of there!

924
01:16:08,022 --> 01:16:09,519
Hold 'em!

925
01:16:14,028 --> 01:16:15,480
Get 'em!

926
01:16:16,655 --> 01:16:17,856
Watch him!

927
01:16:19,492 --> 01:16:20,825
Bike him! Bike him!

928
01:16:26,582 --> 01:16:28,534
Bike him! Bike him!

929
01:16:30,336 --> 01:16:32,504
You got it, baby! You got it!

930
01:16:45,226 --> 01:16:47,685
The ball is fired, and the
second period is underway,

931
01:16:47,686 --> 01:16:49,020
with Tokyo leading one-to-nothing.

932
01:16:49,021 --> 01:16:52,065
Houston forced to come
from behind tonight.

933
01:16:56,529 --> 01:16:58,527
Are you all set up?

934
01:16:58,614 --> 01:17:01,488
Watch the men behind me.
Watch the men behind me.

935
01:17:15,256 --> 01:17:16,923
The ball is in play.

936
01:17:16,924 --> 01:17:19,259
And it's grabbed by
Carter for Houston.

937
01:17:19,260 --> 01:17:21,758
Houston on the offensive attack.

938
01:17:26,725 --> 01:17:28,097
Whoo!

939
01:17:34,650 --> 01:17:36,193
Whoo!

940
01:17:43,075 --> 01:17:45,698
What more have you got? Come on!

941
01:17:46,704 --> 01:17:49,497
Jonathan! Jonathan!

942
01:17:49,498 --> 01:17:52,208
Jonathan! Jonathan!

943
01:17:52,209 --> 01:17:55,128
Jonathan! Jonathan!

944
01:17:56,547 --> 01:17:58,215
Go! Let's go!

945
01:18:00,092 --> 01:18:03,171
Right at the slot. Free
man, and he scores!

946
01:18:05,264 --> 01:18:09,469
Houston goal scored by Jonathan E.

947
01:18:09,518 --> 01:18:13,104
The time, 12:05, second period.

948
01:18:13,105 --> 01:18:14,772
I love this game!

949
01:18:14,773 --> 01:18:16,191
Yeah! Yeah! Whoo!

950
01:18:17,318 --> 01:18:18,918
Grab on there! Grab on there! Yeah!

951
01:18:19,528 --> 01:18:23,653
Some injuries here as three
players are helped off the track.

952
01:18:30,331 --> 01:18:31,748
Spread!

953
01:18:31,916 --> 01:18:33,493
Yeah! Right!

954
01:18:37,463 --> 01:18:39,631
Come on, Moonpie! Moonpie!

955
01:18:39,632 --> 01:18:42,130
Over here! Over here!

956
01:18:43,761 --> 01:18:47,507
What the hell are those guys doing?
I don't know. Come on. Stay close.

957
01:18:57,316 --> 01:18:59,359
I told you stay close.

958
01:19:01,111 --> 01:19:03,696
All right. Turn 'em loose
next time around, all right?

959
01:19:03,697 --> 01:19:04,822
- All right. Go on.
- Yeah.

960
01:19:04,823 --> 01:19:06,491
Go on. Go on. Go on! Come on!

961
01:19:08,035 --> 01:19:09,487
Moonpie!

962
01:19:11,830 --> 01:19:14,624
I got him. I got him.
Let me have him.

963
01:19:38,691 --> 01:19:42,771
Tokyo! Victory! Tokyo! Victory!

964
01:20:10,347 --> 01:20:11,639
Medic.

965
01:20:11,640 --> 01:20:13,057
Everything'll be all right.

966
01:20:13,058 --> 01:20:15,184
Come on. Just sit down over here.

967
01:20:15,185 --> 01:20:16,352
Sit right here.

968
01:20:16,353 --> 01:20:18,313
Everything'll be all right.

969
01:20:18,314 --> 01:20:19,897
Medic! Hey, medic! Come over here!

970
01:20:19,898 --> 01:20:21,315
Come on.

971
01:20:47,092 --> 01:20:48,259
Moonpie!

972
01:21:07,654 --> 01:21:08,780
Come on, Moonpie.

973
01:21:08,781 --> 01:21:10,656
Come on, get some help!

974
01:21:10,657 --> 01:21:12,905
Set him down. Set him down.

975
01:21:13,869 --> 01:21:15,616
Where's oxygen?

976
01:21:48,821 --> 01:21:52,025
Come on, Tokyo! Go and get them!

977
01:21:52,116 --> 01:21:54,034
Go! Go! Go, Tokyo!

978
01:21:54,076 --> 01:21:56,449
Okay, now come on, now!

979
01:21:56,578 --> 01:21:58,913
Jonathan, watch yourself out there.

980
01:21:58,914 --> 01:22:02,542
Jonathan! Jonathan!
Jonathan! Jonathan!

981
01:22:02,543 --> 01:22:06,337
Jonathan! Jonathan!
Jonathan! Jonathan!

982
01:22:06,338 --> 01:22:08,256
Jonathan! Jonathan!

983
01:22:13,887 --> 01:22:15,714
Take me high, Blue.

984
01:22:32,072 --> 01:22:34,900
Tokyo! Victory!

985
01:23:29,588 --> 01:23:31,461
Look out!

986
01:23:32,049 --> 01:23:34,675
Jonathan! Jonathan!

987
01:23:40,057 --> 01:23:41,807
Jonathan E.

988
01:23:41,808 --> 01:23:45,683
Time in the third period...

989
01:24:14,341 --> 01:24:17,215
Spread! Spread! Go kill 'em!

990
01:24:23,100 --> 01:24:27,146
Tokyo! Victory! Tokyo! Victory!

991
01:24:34,236 --> 01:24:36,029
Fall out! Fall out!

992
01:24:38,657 --> 01:24:39,983
Blue.

993
01:25:12,774 --> 01:25:14,601
This way, please.

994
01:25:25,871 --> 01:25:30,416
May I say first, please, that you
played a superb game in our city.

995
01:25:30,626 --> 01:25:31,952
Thank you.

996
01:25:39,593 --> 01:25:42,922
A simple problem, yet I know
it is difficult for you.

997
01:25:42,971 --> 01:25:47,808
Your teammate has no family we can
contact, and permission is required now

998
01:25:47,809 --> 01:25:50,103
before consummating matters.

999
01:25:54,983 --> 01:25:57,068
So he's technically dead?

1000
01:25:57,069 --> 01:25:59,021
Yes, unfortunately.

1001
01:25:59,363 --> 01:26:02,942
His heart and lungs will
function, but his brain is...

1002
01:26:03,283 --> 01:26:05,030
It has expired.

1003
01:26:05,577 --> 01:26:07,996
From the first minutes we
had him, it was hopeless.

1004
01:26:08,372 --> 01:26:11,075
I believe this was
explained to you.

1005
01:26:11,166 --> 01:26:12,367
He's warm.

1006
01:26:13,043 --> 01:26:14,210
Yes.

1007
01:26:14,211 --> 01:26:17,836
But if you will, please. You must
sign a release form. It is required.

1008
01:26:19,966 --> 01:26:21,668
Does he...

1009
01:26:26,932 --> 01:26:28,133
Does he dream?

1010
01:26:28,350 --> 01:26:30,685
No. There is no brain wave at all.

1011
01:26:30,686 --> 01:26:33,896
No sort of consciousness.
Just a deep coma.

1012
01:26:33,897 --> 01:26:35,272
A vegetable.

1013
01:26:35,273 --> 01:26:37,225
No dreams. Nothing.

1014
01:26:38,360 --> 01:26:40,187
Well, even...

1015
01:26:42,322 --> 01:26:44,900
A plant feels something.

1016
01:26:45,075 --> 01:26:46,948
Who can say? Please.

1017
01:26:47,536 --> 01:26:48,988
It...

1018
01:26:51,540 --> 01:26:53,367
Senses life. I mean,

1019
01:26:54,793 --> 01:26:56,870
it turns towards the sun.

1020
01:26:58,964 --> 01:27:00,290
It's alive, isn't it?

1021
01:27:00,507 --> 01:27:01,708
You must sign.

1022
01:27:03,468 --> 01:27:05,011
You...

1023
01:27:06,388 --> 01:27:08,010
You just leave him the way he is.

1024
01:27:10,392 --> 01:27:11,726
Just leave him as he is.

1025
01:27:11,727 --> 01:27:14,145
Someone will have to sign.
There's no other way.

1026
01:27:14,146 --> 01:27:15,855
Arrangements will be made.

1027
01:27:15,856 --> 01:27:18,023
Please. There are hospital
rules that have to be...

1028
01:27:18,024 --> 01:27:19,851
No, there aren't.

1029
01:27:21,194 --> 01:27:22,987
There aren't any rules at all.

1030
01:28:08,992 --> 01:28:11,741
Let me know if you
have any problems.

1031
01:28:12,204 --> 01:28:14,953
You won't find any
answers in Geneva.

1032
01:28:17,042 --> 01:28:19,085
Take care of your arm.

1033
01:28:54,454 --> 01:28:59,501
In my opinion, we are confronted
here with something of a situation.

1034
01:29:00,126 --> 01:29:03,956
Otherwise, I would not have
presumed to take up your time.

1035
01:29:04,506 --> 01:29:08,677
Once again, it concerns
the case of Jonathan E.

1036
01:29:10,679 --> 01:29:14,349
We know we don't want anything
extraordinary to happen to Jonathan.

1037
01:29:14,391 --> 01:29:16,639
We already agreed on that.

1038
01:29:17,310 --> 01:29:19,808
No accidents, nothing unnatural.

1039
01:29:20,772 --> 01:29:25,648
The game was created to demonstrate
the futility of individual effort.

1040
01:29:26,403 --> 01:29:28,856
Let the game do its work.

1041
01:29:29,698 --> 01:29:32,822
If the Energy Corporation
has done all it can

1042
01:29:33,410 --> 01:29:37,830
and if a champion defeats the meaning
for which the game was designed,

1043
01:29:37,956 --> 01:29:40,705
then he must lose.

1044
01:29:42,002 --> 01:29:44,671
I hope you agree with my reasoning.

1045
01:30:06,276 --> 01:30:08,023
Thank you, all.

1046
01:31:04,542 --> 01:31:06,790
Will you follow me, please?

1047
01:31:44,040 --> 01:31:46,250
Hello, hello!

1048
01:31:46,251 --> 01:31:47,953
Yes, it is

1049
01:31:48,044 --> 01:31:50,004
the famous Jonathan E.

1050
01:31:50,005 --> 01:31:51,878
Oh, hard to believe.

1051
01:31:51,881 --> 01:31:53,257
Sorry we've never met.

1052
01:31:53,258 --> 01:31:55,467
The Rollerball Champion.

1053
01:31:55,468 --> 01:31:57,177
Wonderful.

1054
01:31:57,178 --> 01:31:59,513
Not many people come
to see us, you know.

1055
01:31:59,514 --> 01:32:02,308
We're not easy to
talk to, Zero and I.

1056
01:32:02,934 --> 01:32:06,013
We're a little confused
again in here today.

1057
01:32:06,771 --> 01:32:08,769
This is embarrassing.

1058
01:32:10,066 --> 01:32:12,815
It's embarrassing
to misplace things.

1059
01:32:13,111 --> 01:32:14,653
Misplacing data?

1060
01:32:14,654 --> 01:32:17,482
Mmm. The whole of the 13th century.

1061
01:32:20,452 --> 01:32:24,455
Misplaced the computers, several
conventional computers.

1062
01:32:24,456 --> 01:32:26,454
We can't find them.

1063
01:32:27,584 --> 01:32:31,163
We're always moving things
around, getting organized.

1064
01:32:31,963 --> 01:32:35,838
My assistants and I.
But this, this is Zero's fault.

1065
01:32:35,967 --> 01:32:39,171
Zero. He's the world's
file cabinet.

1066
01:32:39,637 --> 01:32:43,808
Eh, pity. Poor old 13th century.

1067
01:32:47,312 --> 01:32:49,310
Well, come along now.

1068
01:32:49,355 --> 01:32:50,856
You want to get started, don't you?

1069
01:32:50,857 --> 01:32:52,354
- Yes, sir.
- Mmm-hmm.

1070
01:32:53,818 --> 01:32:55,270
- Oh.
- Hmm?

1071
01:33:00,325 --> 01:33:01,822
This way.

1072
01:33:02,243 --> 01:33:03,615
Now...

1073
01:33:04,287 --> 01:33:09,458
But we've lost those computers with
all of the 13th century in them.

1074
01:33:09,459 --> 01:33:12,082
Not much in the century, just Dante

1075
01:33:12,629 --> 01:33:17,543
and a few corrupt Popes, but it's
so distracting and annoying.

1076
01:33:18,093 --> 01:33:22,048
You've unlimited restrictions
here, of course.

1077
01:33:22,514 --> 01:33:24,890
You have to come so, so many times.

1078
01:33:24,891 --> 01:33:28,435
It all takes such... Such effort.

1079
01:33:28,436 --> 01:33:30,854
Do the executives still come here?

1080
01:33:30,855 --> 01:33:32,981
Oh, they used to, some of them.

1081
01:33:32,982 --> 01:33:34,191
What about the books?

1082
01:33:34,192 --> 01:33:36,193
Books? Books? Oh, no,
they're all changed,

1083
01:33:36,194 --> 01:33:39,318
all transcribed, all
information's here.

1084
01:33:39,739 --> 01:33:44,661
I mean, Zero, of course. He's the
central brain, the world's brain.

1085
01:33:45,036 --> 01:33:47,238
Fluid mechanics, fluidics.

1086
01:33:48,289 --> 01:33:52,119
He's liquid, you see.
He's water to touch.

1087
01:33:53,336 --> 01:33:55,038
All knowledge.

1088
01:33:58,466 --> 01:34:02,762
Everything we ask has become
so, ah, so complicated now.

1089
01:34:03,221 --> 01:34:04,471
Each thing we ask...

1090
01:34:04,472 --> 01:34:07,474
This morning, we wanted to know
something about the 13th century.

1091
01:34:07,475 --> 01:34:10,811
He flows out into all
our storage systems.

1092
01:34:10,812 --> 01:34:12,563
He considers everything.

1093
01:34:12,564 --> 01:34:14,437
He's become so

1094
01:34:14,858 --> 01:34:16,560
ambiguous now.

1095
01:34:16,693 --> 01:34:19,772
As if he knows nothing at all.

1096
01:34:20,071 --> 01:34:22,739
Could you tell me something
about the corporate wars?

1097
01:34:22,740 --> 01:34:24,616
Wars? Wars?

1098
01:34:24,617 --> 01:34:26,952
Oh, yes, of course, we
have them all here.

1099
01:34:26,953 --> 01:34:29,705
Punic War, Prussian
War, Peloponnesian War.

1100
01:34:29,706 --> 01:34:31,290
Crimean War, Wars of the Roses.

1101
01:34:31,291 --> 01:34:36,042
One doesn't perhaps recall them
in sequence, but corporate wars.

1102
01:34:36,796 --> 01:34:41,172
Well, Zero will or can, I'm
sure, tell you anything.

1103
01:34:50,435 --> 01:34:53,559
A memory pool, you see.

1104
01:34:55,231 --> 01:34:57,441
He's supposed to tell
us where things are

1105
01:34:57,442 --> 01:35:00,065
and what they might possibly mean.

1106
01:35:02,238 --> 01:35:04,361
Look, Zero, a visitor.

1107
01:35:05,783 --> 01:35:08,782
Jonathan E.,
the Rollerball Champion.

1108
01:35:09,871 --> 01:35:12,699
You've filed away a
lot of data on him.

1109
01:35:13,791 --> 01:35:15,459
Do you remember?

1110
01:35:16,794 --> 01:35:18,045
Does it answer you?

1111
01:35:18,046 --> 01:35:19,919
Oh, yes. He speaks.

1112
01:35:20,381 --> 01:35:22,254
He finds things.

1113
01:35:22,550 --> 01:35:24,377
And loses them,

1114
01:35:24,886 --> 01:35:27,680
and confuses itself.

1115
01:35:29,974 --> 01:35:32,309
Ask anything.
He'll find it for you.

1116
01:35:32,310 --> 01:35:34,353
A section on Bach...

1117
01:35:34,354 --> 01:35:36,181
Won't you, Zero?

1118
01:35:37,148 --> 01:35:39,442
All right. I'd like...

1119
01:35:41,319 --> 01:35:45,740
I'd like some information
about corporate decisions.

1120
01:35:46,157 --> 01:35:47,797
How they're made and
who makes them.

1121
01:35:52,664 --> 01:35:54,616
Zero...

1122
01:35:54,999 --> 01:35:57,122
You heard the question.

1123
01:35:57,502 --> 01:35:58,627
Answer him.

1124
01:36:00,171 --> 01:36:01,505
Negative.

1125
01:36:01,506 --> 01:36:05,427
You don't have to give him
a full political briefing.

1126
01:36:06,386 --> 01:36:07,511
Answer.

1127
01:36:07,512 --> 01:36:08,887
Negative.

1128
01:36:08,888 --> 01:36:11,216
This is Jonathan E.

1129
01:36:11,391 --> 01:36:13,138
He has to know.

1130
01:36:14,352 --> 01:36:16,099
Make it simple.

1131
01:36:17,188 --> 01:36:18,438
Answer.

1132
01:36:18,439 --> 01:36:22,018
Corporate decisions are made
by corporate executives.

1133
01:36:22,193 --> 01:36:23,735
Corporate executives make...

1134
01:36:23,736 --> 01:36:27,656
I know we have the answers.
We do have. They're the waters of history.

1135
01:36:27,657 --> 01:36:29,734
Energy equals genius...

1136
01:36:30,952 --> 01:36:33,036
I don't want to bully you.

1137
01:36:33,037 --> 01:36:34,955
Genius is energy.

1138
01:36:34,956 --> 01:36:37,749
Corporate entities control...

1139
01:36:37,750 --> 01:36:39,751
I shall have to answer!

1140
01:36:39,752 --> 01:36:42,546
Of economic life, technology,

1141
01:36:42,547 --> 01:36:45,590
capital, labor, and markets.

1142
01:36:45,591 --> 01:36:47,134
Corporate decisions are made...

1143
01:36:47,135 --> 01:36:49,212
You have to, Zero.

1144
01:36:51,639 --> 01:36:54,558
Let's show him policy.

1145
01:36:54,559 --> 01:36:57,352
Negative. Negative.
Negative. Negative.

1146
01:36:57,353 --> 01:37:00,181
Negative. Negative.
Negative. Negative.

1147
01:37:31,596 --> 01:37:33,298
Hello, Johnny.

1148
01:37:34,974 --> 01:37:36,175
Morning, Ella.

1149
01:37:37,769 --> 01:37:39,221
Nervous.

1150
01:37:41,939 --> 01:37:43,516
How are you?

1151
01:37:49,739 --> 01:37:52,362
I'm... I'm all right, I guess.

1152
01:37:56,954 --> 01:37:58,906
What are you doing?

1153
01:37:59,457 --> 01:38:01,284
Looking at you.

1154
01:38:02,585 --> 01:38:04,503
Counting your scars.

1155
01:38:05,421 --> 01:38:06,505
Yeah.

1156
01:38:06,506 --> 01:38:08,708
Seeing how you've changed.

1157
01:38:09,467 --> 01:38:11,214
Oh, I mean, that's...

1158
01:38:11,386 --> 01:38:12,803
That's all I've changed, huh?

1159
01:38:12,804 --> 01:38:14,971
Just a little more beat up.

1160
01:38:14,972 --> 01:38:16,344
Oh, no.

1161
01:38:17,600 --> 01:38:19,473
You're just not...

1162
01:38:21,396 --> 01:38:23,018
Yeah, well...

1163
01:38:25,900 --> 01:38:27,352
Come on.

1164
01:38:39,664 --> 01:38:42,040
You want a drink or something?

1165
01:38:42,041 --> 01:38:43,743
No, thank you.

1166
01:38:44,502 --> 01:38:46,704
You have a lovely place.

1167
01:38:46,796 --> 01:38:48,505
Well, thank you.

1168
01:38:48,506 --> 01:38:50,715
Well, I've seen your house.

1169
01:38:50,716 --> 01:38:52,213
You have?

1170
01:38:54,804 --> 01:38:56,881
Yeah. When we, uh,

1171
01:38:58,015 --> 01:38:59,888
played in Rome,

1172
01:39:00,518 --> 01:39:02,470
I stood a block away

1173
01:39:04,021 --> 01:39:06,815
and watched your front
gate for a couple hours.

1174
01:39:10,528 --> 01:39:13,197
I was just, uh,

1175
01:39:15,575 --> 01:39:18,904
standing there wondering

1176
01:39:20,538 --> 01:39:22,539
what your furniture looked like.

1177
01:39:22,540 --> 01:39:24,541
What you said to each
other in the morning.

1178
01:39:27,170 --> 01:39:28,496
Yeah.

1179
01:39:28,880 --> 01:39:31,754
What's he like? What's he do?

1180
01:39:33,509 --> 01:39:35,051
Oh, he's a city engineer.

1181
01:39:35,052 --> 01:39:36,299
Ah.

1182
01:39:37,472 --> 01:39:39,470
We have a jet copter.

1183
01:39:40,266 --> 01:39:41,638
A son.

1184
01:39:41,851 --> 01:39:44,099
Two cats, and a place in the Alps.

1185
01:39:46,147 --> 01:39:48,566
Well, you don't really
want hear all of this.

1186
01:39:49,692 --> 01:39:51,144
Son, huh?

1187
01:39:51,736 --> 01:39:53,028
Yes.

1188
01:39:57,366 --> 01:39:59,568
We have a lot of friends.

1189
01:39:59,785 --> 01:40:01,237
And he has a lover.

1190
01:40:01,412 --> 01:40:03,364
We have furniture a lot like yours.

1191
01:40:05,416 --> 01:40:07,209
Same taste in furniture,
how about that?

1192
01:40:07,210 --> 01:40:08,832
Yes.

1193
01:40:12,590 --> 01:40:14,508
You know, Johnny.

1194
01:40:14,926 --> 01:40:17,594
All they want is a kind
of incidental control

1195
01:40:17,595 --> 01:40:19,797
over just a part of our lives.

1196
01:40:20,515 --> 01:40:22,933
I mean, they have control
economically and politically,

1197
01:40:22,934 --> 01:40:24,434
but they also provide.

1198
01:40:24,435 --> 01:40:25,602
You know they do.

1199
01:40:25,603 --> 01:40:27,305
Provide, huh?

1200
01:40:31,901 --> 01:40:35,278
You know, they were responsible
for taking you away.

1201
01:40:35,279 --> 01:40:37,322
And I started to hate 'em.

1202
01:40:37,323 --> 01:40:38,991
They weren't.

1203
01:40:40,117 --> 01:40:42,115
It was the game, Johnny.

1204
01:40:48,626 --> 01:40:52,581
I mean, it was important to you.

1205
01:40:57,134 --> 01:40:59,678
It was as if I wasn't even there.

1206
01:41:03,057 --> 01:41:05,680
You played. There was nothing else.

1207
01:41:08,688 --> 01:41:10,231
I'm sorry.

1208
01:41:14,694 --> 01:41:16,942
You know I wanted you here.

1209
01:41:17,613 --> 01:41:19,156
I mean...

1210
01:41:20,491 --> 01:41:23,194
This might sound all wrong, but,

1211
01:41:25,329 --> 01:41:27,782
I mean, I was just trying to

1212
01:41:28,833 --> 01:41:30,831
remember myself then.

1213
01:41:33,963 --> 01:41:35,255
Yeah.

1214
01:41:38,134 --> 01:41:39,881
Maybe it was

1215
01:41:41,429 --> 01:41:43,973
love I wanted to try to remember.

1216
01:41:59,530 --> 01:42:01,653
There's, uh,

1217
01:42:03,701 --> 01:42:05,744
a lot of things I want
to talk to you about.

1218
01:42:10,082 --> 01:42:11,408
Yeah.

1219
01:42:16,422 --> 01:42:18,624
I've been thinking, Ella.

1220
01:42:18,674 --> 01:42:20,626
Been thinking a lot.

1221
01:42:21,135 --> 01:42:22,803
And watching.

1222
01:42:23,471 --> 01:42:27,891
It's like people who had
a choice long time ago

1223
01:42:27,892 --> 01:42:31,603
between having all them nice things

1224
01:42:31,604 --> 01:42:34,603
or their freedom.

1225
01:42:34,899 --> 01:42:36,772
Of course, they, uh,

1226
01:42:37,902 --> 01:42:39,604
chose comfort.

1227
01:42:40,112 --> 01:42:42,235
But comfort is freedom.

1228
01:42:42,657 --> 01:42:44,609
It always has been.

1229
01:42:45,618 --> 01:42:49,204
The whole history of civilization is
a struggle against poverty and need.

1230
01:42:49,205 --> 01:42:52,123
No. No, that... That's not it.

1231
01:42:52,124 --> 01:42:53,541
That's never been it.

1232
01:42:53,542 --> 01:42:55,669
I mean, them privileges
just buy us off.

1233
01:42:59,757 --> 01:43:01,959
Look.

1234
01:43:02,927 --> 01:43:05,129
They want me to quit, Ella.

1235
01:43:06,430 --> 01:43:07,973
Then quit.

1236
01:43:09,642 --> 01:43:11,640
Just like that, huh?

1237
01:43:11,644 --> 01:43:13,972
But you've got to do it now.

1238
01:43:14,230 --> 01:43:16,231
You've got to before it's too late.

1239
01:43:16,232 --> 01:43:18,480
Whether you want to or not.

1240
01:43:21,195 --> 01:43:22,942
Look, Johnny,

1241
01:43:23,531 --> 01:43:27,242
the next game there won't be
any substitutions allowed.

1242
01:43:27,243 --> 01:43:28,740
And no time limit.

1243
01:43:29,787 --> 01:43:32,455
You'll die, Johnny.
Everybody will die.

1244
01:43:32,456 --> 01:43:35,079
No time limit. They tell you that?

1245
01:43:35,167 --> 01:43:36,459
Yes.

1246
01:43:36,502 --> 01:43:38,702
They tell you to come here
and convince me to quit?

1247
01:43:38,713 --> 01:43:41,416
Yes, but that isn't
why I came here.

1248
01:43:41,924 --> 01:43:44,297
You have to get out
for your own sake.

1249
01:43:44,802 --> 01:43:47,004
Oh, please, Johnny, please.

1250
01:43:48,139 --> 01:43:51,343
They tell you to
stay if I did quit?

1251
01:43:54,353 --> 01:43:56,226
You my big reward?

1252
01:44:35,811 --> 01:44:38,855
You still don't understand
why I came here.

1253
01:44:42,610 --> 01:44:45,359
You're the only
person I ever wanted.

1254
01:44:46,947 --> 01:44:49,570
I wanted you on my
side, that's all.

1255
01:45:41,210 --> 01:45:43,458
It's like you're a God now.

1256
01:45:46,298 --> 01:45:48,626
Maybe you know what I don't.

1257
01:45:52,638 --> 01:45:53,964
I...

1258
01:45:55,391 --> 01:45:57,889
I've been so stupid for so long.

1259
01:46:08,404 --> 01:46:10,481
I've been so stubborn.

1260
01:46:11,198 --> 01:46:13,199
I don't even know why.

1261
01:46:13,200 --> 01:46:14,868
It scares me.

1262
01:46:20,833 --> 01:46:24,499
You know, I'm probably gonna...
Probably gonna die.

1263
01:46:27,423 --> 01:46:31,093
And you'll be in here pumping
away long after I'm gone.

1264
01:46:46,650 --> 01:46:48,397
Hey, you...

1265
01:46:48,986 --> 01:46:51,188
You got it made, old buddy.

1266
01:46:52,907 --> 01:46:55,155
Bluebonnets and everything.

1267
01:49:03,537 --> 01:49:08,166
Jonathan! Jonathan!
Jonathan! Jonathan!

1268
01:49:08,167 --> 01:49:12,042
Houston! Houston! Houston! Houston!

1269
01:49:17,092 --> 01:49:21,422
Jonathan! Jonathan!
Jonathan! Jonathan!

1270
01:50:17,236 --> 01:50:19,859
Jonathan's dead! Jonathan's dead!

1271
01:50:40,384 --> 01:50:43,428
Jonathan's dead! Jonathan's dead!

1272
01:50:44,513 --> 01:50:48,138
Houston! Houston! Houston! Houston!

1273
01:50:54,273 --> 01:50:57,233
Attention! Your attention, please.

1274
01:50:57,234 --> 01:51:01,280
Rule changes for tonight's
World Championship game.

1275
01:51:01,405 --> 01:51:04,950
No substitutions, no penalties,

1276
01:51:05,492 --> 01:51:08,161
and no time limit.

1277
01:51:31,977 --> 01:51:35,355
All right, watch it now. He's got the
ball, next time around we defend.

1278
01:52:01,590 --> 01:52:04,384
Jonathan's dead! Jonathan's dead!

1279
01:52:24,154 --> 01:52:28,075
Houston! Houston! Houston! Houston!

1280
01:52:59,481 --> 01:53:02,309
Jonathan's dead! Jonathan's dead!

1281
01:54:08,842 --> 01:54:11,010
Come on! Come on, get out of there!

1282
01:54:26,526 --> 01:54:27,773
Get him up!

1283
01:54:43,085 --> 01:54:44,502
He did it!

1284
01:54:52,135 --> 01:54:54,463
All right. That's right,
get him in the elevator.

1285
01:55:00,394 --> 01:55:01,686
Get off the rail!

1286
01:55:03,313 --> 01:55:06,983
Jonathan's dead! Jonathan's
dead! Jonathan's dead!

1287
01:55:09,736 --> 01:55:11,656
- Come on!
- We gotta get him off the track.

1288
01:55:23,125 --> 01:55:24,834
I don't want another
man on that track!

1289
01:55:24,835 --> 01:55:26,795
Houston, what the hell
are you trying to do?

1290
01:55:32,426 --> 01:55:33,968
Nobody's gonna win this game!

1291
01:55:33,969 --> 01:55:36,968
Game? This wasn't
meant to be a game!

1292
01:55:37,848 --> 01:55:39,220
Never!

1293
01:55:47,399 --> 01:55:49,818
- Jonathan! Jonathan!
- Houston! Houston!

1294
01:55:57,325 --> 01:56:00,574
Watch his leg. Watch
that leg. Easy, easy.

1295
01:56:01,955 --> 01:56:05,329
Let me have him. Let me
have him! Let me have him!

1296
01:56:19,931 --> 01:56:22,930
Move out. Move out.

1297
02:00:59,461 --> 02:01:01,208
Jonathan.

1298
02:01:02,088 --> 02:01:03,540
Jonathan.

1299
02:01:04,215 --> 02:01:07,919
Jonathan. Jonathan.

1300
02:01:08,136 --> 02:01:11,715
Jonathan! Jonathan!

1301
02:01:18,521 --> 02:01:19,973
Jonathan.

1302
02:01:20,690 --> 02:01:22,187
Jonathan.

1303
02:01:22,317 --> 02:01:25,270
Jonathan! Jonathan!

1304
02:01:25,361 --> 02:01:28,360
Jonathan! Jonathan!

1305
02:01:31,910 --> 02:01:34,112
Jonathan!

1306
02:01:36,748 --> 02:01:38,370
Jonathan!
