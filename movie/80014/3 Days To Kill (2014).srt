否则恐怕无能为力

137
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,603
那还好几个月呢
That's months from now.

138
00:15:28,604 --> 00:15:31,200
法律规定 我们必须要在冬天保护这些非法居住者

139
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:35,159
看来我得自己动手把他们扔出去
Then I guess I need to throw them out myself.

140
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:37,886
嘿! 不行!
No, no, no, hey, ho.

141
00:15:37,999 --> 00:15:39,886
这可不是个好主意 因为你要真那么干

142
00:15:40,401 --> 00:15:42,301
你就会因为违法被抓起来

143
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,597
我会被... 嘿! 我会被抓起来?
I'll go to... Hey! I'll go to jail?

144
00:15:45,598 --> 00:15:46,410
必然的!

145
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:49,207
成吧 那我现在能做什么?
All right, what exactly then am I supposed to do?

146
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:50,500
等春天来喽!

147
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:52,510
就像那些鸟儿 蜜蜂

148
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:54,559
那些少男少女们

149
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,959
你还真敢跟我说这话?
Did you really just say that to me?

150
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:05,644
伊桑 伊桑!
Ethan, Ethan!

151
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,639
我需要跟你老爸谈谈
I need to talk to your dad.

152
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:12,319
喂!
Psst!

153
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,841
就一分钟 等我把电话打完
Please give me a minute to finish my call.

154
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:24,846
- 真抱歉 伊桑  - 朱尔 我们需要单独谈谈 到我房间来
- I'm sorry, Ethan.  - Let's talk in private, Jules, in my room.

155
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,999
我保证 我们绝对没动过你任何东西
I can assure you, we have not touched any of your things.

156
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:36,159
我没说你动过 但我想差不多是时候
I'm not saying you did, but I think it's time you and I

157
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,479
让我们彼此更坦诚一点了
got to know each other just a little better.

158
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:43,049
因为你闯进的不是一个普通人的房间
Cause you're not just crashing at some guy's house.

159
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:48,451
没问题 伊桑 我们现在就去收拾东西 马上就走
No problem, Ethan. We will pack and leave now.

160
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:50,000
没事儿 苏米亚 快出去

161
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:53,850
你带着个怀孕的孩子能去哪儿?
Where are you going to go with a pregnant kid?

162
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:57,639
没想好 但我们现在就走 东西不要了
I don't know, but we'll leave without packing.

163
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:59,171
坐下
Sit down.

164
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:11,639
朱尔 你们不用搬出去 至少...
You don't have to go yet, Jules, at least...

165
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:14,446
至少可以等到你女儿生完孩子
not until your daughter has her baby.

166
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:19,759
但是 你们得遵守我的规矩
But you stay under my rules.

167
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:23,879
- 我也是规矩的忠实信徒  - 第一条 不许再踏进这个房间
- I am also a believer in rules.  - Rule #1, no one steps in this room again.

168
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:27,439
绝对不会 我会在门口树个大牌子
No one. Absolutely. I'll put a bigger sign.

169
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:29,199
这就对了 放个大点儿的
That's right, you put a bigger sign.

170
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:33,319
第二条 我怎么说你就怎么做 别问为什么
Rule #2, you always do what I say, no questions asked.

171
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:35,439
当然
Yes, of course.

172
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:40,359
第三条 不许再刷我的房间
And rule #3, you don't ever paint my room again.

173
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:42,359
- 你不喜欢这颜色?  - 当然不
- You don't like the color?  - No.

174
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:45,359
我早就跟我媳妇说过 没有哪个男人喜欢黄色
I told my wife yellow is not a man's color.

175
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,961
嗯 黄色不适合男人
No, yellow is not a man's color.

176
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:53,239
- 你也有个女儿?  - 嗯
- So you also have a daughter?  - Yes.

177
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:56,205
就像苏米亚
Like Sumia.

178
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,519
好啦好啦 不会再刷黄色了
OK, OK, no more yellow.

179
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:20,879
谁是世上最漂亮的女孩?
Who is the most beautiful girl in the world?

180
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,599
- 是你吗?  - 爸爸 你看!
- Is that you?  - Look, Daddy!

181
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:23,879
多可爱呀!
That is so cute!

182
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:31,804
跑! 快跑!
Run, run, run!

183
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:47,279
你好 克里斯汀
Hey, salut, Christine.

184
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,164
你好呀
Hi, you.

185
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,763
嗨
Hey.

186
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,163
这是我妻子

187
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:05,119
- 我是克里斯汀  - 蒂娜 是我
- This is Christine.  - Hello, Tina. It's me.

188
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,731
我回来了
I'm in town.

189
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:12,687
我现在正在开会 不太方便接电话
I'm in a meeting right now, so this is not a good time to talk.

190
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:17,359
我也不想和你在电话里说 我们见一面吧
I don't want to talk. I want to see you.

191
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:20,679
唔 我最近特别忙
Yeah, I'm exceptionally busy,

192
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:23,479
如果是急事再说
so, uh... unless it's urgent.

193
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:27,439
在我离开以前 有些法律上的文件需要你看看
I've got some legal stuff I need you to look at before I leave town.

194
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:28,971
为什么?
Why?

195
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,759
- 你准备结婚了?  - 没有 怎么这么问 难道你快了?
- Are you getting married?  - No, why, are you?

196
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:37,199
没呢 至少不是今天
No, not today.

197
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,085
好吧 我会在外面等你
All right, I'll meet you outside.

198
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,890
好的 等下见
OK, see ya.

199
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,519
伊桑 我们到这儿来干嘛?
Why are we really here, Ethan?

200
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:56,324
我想见见你
I wanted to see you.

201
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:03,199
那我们的女儿呢 你想见她吗?
And our daughter, you want to see her too?

202
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:06,006
当然
Yes. Yes.

203
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:09,999
我给佐伊开了个大学基金
I started a college fund.

204
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,999
怎么突然这么关心家里了?
Why the sudden interest?

205
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,439
蒂娜 我不是一时兴起 我试着和她保持联络的
It's not sudden, Tina. I try to stay in touch.

206
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,449
她生日的时候 我给她留言了
I left her a message on her birthday.

207
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:22,999
嗯 是啊 她现在得为了听到你的消息再等一年了
Yes, and now she'll have to wait another year to hear from you again.

208
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,799
蒂娜 我快死了
I'm dying, Tina.

209
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:28,527
- 难道你觉得我就不难受?  - 不是这意思 我...
- You think this is easy for me?  - No, I'm...

210
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:32,411
我生病了
I'm sick.

211
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,639
我是说 我活不长了
I mean, I'm dying.

212
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:40,759
很抱歉让您久等了 但我恐怕您的遗嘱
Sorry it took so long, but I'm afraid your will

213
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:44,203
必须同时以法文和英文签署方能生效
must be signed in both French and English.

214
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:51,767
我不想让佐伊知道 至少现在别告诉她
I don't want Zooey to know, at least not right away.

215
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:00,441
进来吧
Come on in.

216
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:11,439
挺漂亮的
It's nice.

217
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:15,119
这房子比原来那个好多了
The place looks better than before.

218
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:19,159
别看得太仔细 勉强没散架而已
Don't look too hard. It's falling apart.

219
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:22,011
我知道我对你和佐伊亏欠得太多
I know I haven't done right by you and Zooey.

220
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:26,487
我想在走前看看她
I want to see her before I go.

221
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,528
你得跟我保证
You have to make me a promise.

222
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:39,806
只有在一种情况下 我会让你见她
I'll let you see her under one condition.

223
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,201
你辞职了吗?
Are you done?

224
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:46,439
你真的不再为他们工作了吗?
Are you really done working for them?

225
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:49,564
- 是的  - 向我保证
- Yes.  - Promise me.

226
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:54,607
我保证 我失去了很多
Yes. I missed a lot.

227
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,719
很久之前我就该离开了
I should have left a long time ago.

228
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,599
我会很好的
I'm gonna be fine.

229
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,279
我已经计划好一整天了 首先...
I've got the whole day planned. First...

230
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:08,159
哦 不 不 宝贝 不 她有她自己的计划
Oh, no, no, sweetheart, no. She has her own plans.

231
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,559
你只要跟上她就行了 嗨 宝贝!
You'll just have to catch up. Hi, sweetie!

232
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:12,489
嗨
Hi.

233
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,566
嗨 佐伊
Hi, Zooey.

234
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:21,560
你还好吗?
How are you?

235
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,759
我很好 你呢?
I'm good, how are you?

236
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,769
我很好 谢谢
I'm good, thank you.

237
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:31,599
- 好了  - 妈妈 拜托你别哭 我很好
- OK.  - Mom, please don't cry. I'm fine.

238
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:35,119
没有 我只是... 我八点半回家 好吗?
No, I'm just... I'll be back home at 8:30. Yeah?

239
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,719
我们要干嘛?
What are we supposed to do?

240
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,604
好吧 我来做饭如何?
All right, how about I cook?

241
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,766
你说的
You're on.

242
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:46,203
那么 你想让我叫你爸爸还是叫你伊桑?
So you want me to call you Dad or should I just call you Ethan?

243
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:48,770
我更喜欢爸爸这个称呼
I think I like Dad.

244
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,519
放学后有什么喜欢去的地方吗?
Favorite place to go after school?

245
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:54,399
我不知道我们有什么喜欢的地方可去
I didn't know we had a favorite place.

246
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,959
空中转椅 记得吗?
Flying chairs, remember?

247
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:00,079
听我说 伊桑 我们没必要这样 好吗?
Look, Ethan, we don't need to do this, all right?

248
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:02,719
我知道你可能想要跟我聊天 然后互相了解一下
I know you probably want to talk and get to know each other.

249
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:05,119
这就是我搬回巴黎的原因
That's why I transferred back here to Paris.

250
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:07,399
听着 我不是在生你的气 明白吗?
Look, I'm not mad at you, all right?

251
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:11,079
我也不需要你为此解释什么 这没什么大不了的
I don't need you to explain any of this, all right? It's not a big deal.

252
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:13,839
走吧 佐伊 我们去咖啡馆吧
Come on, Zoe, let's go to the cafe.

253
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:16,679
修 我想让你认识一下伊桑
Hugh, I want you to meet Ethan.

254
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:18,159
谁啊?
Who?

255
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:21,045
- 我是佐伊的爸爸  - 哦! 你好
- I'm Zooey's father.  - Oh! Hello.

256
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,806
不
No.

257
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:31,199
很高兴见到你 伊桑... 雷纳先生
Well, great to meet you, Ethan... Mr. Renner.

258
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:34,879
抱歉 有时候我见到美国牛仔的时候
Sorry, sometimes I just get a bit nervous

259
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,319
会过分紧张
when I see American cowboys.

260
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:39,799
咦哈!
Yee-haw!

261
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:41,331
好吧
OK.

262
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:45,199
他比你大
He's older than you.

263
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,839
是的 他是高年级的
Yeah, he's a senior.

264
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:48,159
有什么问题吗?
Is there something wrong with that?

265
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:50,399
想想我那时候...
Back when I was growing up if you...

266
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,239
修跟你很不一样
Hugh is so different than you.

267
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:55,239
听着 我知道我搞砸了 佐伊 我...
Look, I know I'm blowing it here, Zooey, I...

268
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:57,279
你看 我...
Look, I...

269
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:59,244
我想你可能想要骑着这个回家
thought you might want to ride this home.

270
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:03,039
- 哇哦 给我买的?  - 是的
- Wow, is this for me?  - Yeah.

271
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:06,839
真的... 太紫了
It's... so purple.

272
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:08,439
是的 是你最喜欢的颜色
Yeah, it's your favorite color.

273
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:09,880
没错 那是我九岁时候最喜欢的
Right, when I was like nine.

274
00:24:09,881 --> 00:24:13,119
我和朋友一起坐地铁回去
I'm taking the metro with my friends.

275
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:15,121
好吧 那我们晚饭时候家里见?
All right, so I'll see you at home for dinner?

276
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:22,362
佐伊 晚饭的时候家里见?
Zooey, I'll see you at home for dinner?

277
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:10,999
- 这些怎么样?  - 很新鲜
- How are these?  - Fresh.

278
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,359
很新鲜是吗? 那我只要蒸一下就可以了是吗?
They're fresh? I just need to steam them, right?

279
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:15,121
别忘了在牛奶里泡一下
Don't forget to soak it in milk.

280
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,239
牛奶?
Milk?

281
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:20,329
如果你打算煎一下的话
Only if you plan to fry it.

282
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:23,890
还做不了那么复杂的
Haven't got that far.

283
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:28,599
我喜欢那种不会假装自己很会下厨的男人
I like a man that doesn't pretend to know his way around the kitchen.

284
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:31,199
是嘛 那么你选对人了
Yeah, well, you're talking to the right guy.

285
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,401
是的...
Yes...

286
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:36,210
我想是对了
I think I am.

287
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:42,559
好了 我会用牛奶泡一下金枪鱼
Well, I'm soaking tuna in milk and

288
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:44,279
然后给我的女儿煎一下 谢了
thanks to you, frying it for my daughter.

289
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:47,802
所以今天是佐伊的幸运日咯?
So today is Zooey's lucky day?

290
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,319
你刚刚说你的名字叫什么?
What did you say your name was?

291
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,719
你可以叫我薇薇
You can call me Vivi.

292
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:59,730
很高兴碰到你 薇薇 但我对你没兴趣
Nice running into you, Vivi, but not interested.

293
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:09,011
也许我们能聊聊
Maybe we could talk?

294
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,769
这是我老婆给我的
My wife gave me this.

295
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:25,243
来吧 亲爱的 我们去兜兜风
Come on, cheri, let's go for a drive.

296
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:31,328
好吧 但是得带着我的自行车
All right, but my bike's coming with me.

297
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:38,044
要带上我的自行车
The bike's going with me.

298
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,479
你到底为谁干活 薇薇?
Who exactly do you work for, Vivi?

299
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,799
我为中情局局长工作
I work for the Director of the CIA.

300
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:48,879
我可不认识
Wouldn't know about the top shelf.

301
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:51,319
塞尔维亚是我组织的任务
Serbia was my operation.

302
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:52,851
我在找"狼王"
I was looking for the Wolf.

303
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:56,039
我们确定那天他在酒店
We believe he was at the hotel that day,

304
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:57,519
而且我确定你很有可能见过他
and I believe that you may have seen him.

305
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,799
- 等等  - 而且我也愿意打赌
- Wait a minute.  - And I'm willing to bet

306
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:02,685
就是你再见到他一定能认出来
that when you see him again you'll recognize him.

307
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:10,039
我想让你为我工作
I want you to come work for me.

308
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:13,559
没门 我已经有计划了
Not a chance. I've already got plans.

309
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:15,959
你不觉得佐伊值得让她的父亲
Don't you think Zooey deserves to have her daddy around

310
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:18,527
陪她不仅仅是几个月吗?
for more than just a few measly months?

311
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:23,447
天啊!
Jesus!

312
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:27,001
差一点就撞到了
That was really close.

313
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:32,010
作为你扫尾工作的交换 我可以提供你一种试验中的药物
In exchange for your cleaning services, I could offer you an experimental drug.

314
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:35,519
有兴趣吗?
Interested?

315
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:38,963
伊桑 这个可以延长你的生命
This, Ethan, could extend your life.

316
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:46,800
文件呢?
Where's the literature?

317
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:49,491
你知道的 就是试验结果
You know, the test results.

318
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,799
为什么以前从来没人告诉过我这个?
How come no one's told me about this before?

319
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:58,519
因为你没有治疗的价值
Because you weren't worth the cost of treatment.

320
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:01,879
哇哦 你让我觉得自己真特别
Wow. You make me feel so special.

321
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:04,731
- 以前不特别 但现在是  - 为什么?
- You weren't. But now you are.  - Why?

322
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:09,599
因为你是个一无所有 濒临死亡的病人
Because you're sick and dead men have nothing to lose.

323
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:12,999
我能得到很多东西 伊桑
I have access to many things, Ethan,

324
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,328
但只有你能帮我拿下"狼王"
but only you can give me access to the Wolf.

325
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:18,005
我需要你找到他...
I need you to find him...

326
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,039
并且需要你杀了他
and I need you to kill him.

327
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:23,599
所以我用帮你杀人来买自己的命?
So I buy back my life by killing for you?

328
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,799
你什么时候变得这么自以为是了?
When did you become so self-righteous?

329
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:28,759
天啊 我只是想确定我们说的还是不是同一件事
Jesus Christ, I just wanna be sure that we're talking about the same thing here.

330
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:29,847
就是刺杀
You know, killing.

331
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,479
里面有一个人为"狼王"的会计工作
There's a man inside that works for the Wolf's accountant.

332
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,250
我需要你立马行动
I'm gonna need you to start right away.

333
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:45,999
我还有一条鱼要煎 而且我要迟到了
Well, I got a fish to fry and I'm late.

334
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,646
我会在晚饭的时候把你带回家 伊桑
I can get you in home in time for dinner, Ethan.

335
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:51,365
问题是...
Question is...

336
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:54,442
你还想要你的自行车吗?
do you want your bike back?

337
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:07,199
- 这里人太多了  - 意思是?
- Pretty public place.  - Meaning?

338
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,050
意思是需要...
Meaning a silencer would...

339
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:12,050
消声器
be handy.

340
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,559
我们说的是几个人?
So, how many guys are we talking about?

341
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:16,841
一个
One.

342
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,159
要爆头
Knock 'em dead.

343
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:23,284
是啊 没错 那是重点 不是吗?
Yeah, well, that's the point, isn't it?

344
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:53,380
- 该死!  - 他每次都会打电话来

345
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:54,403
喂?
Allo?

346
00:29:54,403 --> 00:29:55,403
帮我开门

347
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,640
手榴弹!
Grenade!

348
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:42,440
他竟然用门挡骗我们!

349
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:06,285
你这临时工干得不错
Pretty good for a jobber.

350
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:11,559
你说的是一个人 不是五个
You said there'd be one guy, not five.

351
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:13,159
哎呀
Oops.

352
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:16,879
但是我还说过要留着小胡子年轻人的命
But I did say keep the young man with the mustache alive.

353
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,679
你觉得这男人长什么样?
What do you think this guy looks like?

354
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:21,999
- 中年人  - 不可能
- Middle-aged.  - Not a chance.

355
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,479
- 告诉她你几岁了  - 我...
- Tell her how old you are.  - I am...

356
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:27,319
努努力 好吗? 我可是尽力想救你一命
Make an effort, all right? I'm trying to save your life.

357
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:29,966
- 现在告诉她你多大了  - 32岁
- Now tell her how old you are.  - I'm 32.

358
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:35,331
- 中年人  - 天啊!
- Middle-aged.  - Jesus Christ!

359
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:38,719
看看...
Now this...

360
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:43,239
这个才是留小胡子的年轻人
is a young man with a mustache.

361
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:45,599
不 那个是山羊胡
No, that's a goatee.

362
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:48,167
那个是小胡子的胡茬
That's a mustache and some stubble.

363
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:51,799
- 那是山羊胡  - 那是山羊胡吗?
- That's a goatee.  - That's a goatee?

364
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:54,519
那才小胡子 好吗? 这个是山羊胡
That's a mustache, all right? This is a goatee.

365
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:55,839
- 那是影子  - 看起来像法国人
- That's a shadow.  - It looks French.

366
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:57,279
- 谁说的?  - 那个是山羊胡...
- Since when?  - That's a goatee...

367
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:58,959
你那个世纪的说法吗 老爷爷?
What, from your century, grandpa?

368
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,519
你看看 那就是小胡子
Look at that, that's a mustache.

369
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:02,559
好吧 那剩下的人呢?
All right, so what about the rest of these guys?

370
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:04,159
- 恩?  - 哦 我的...
- Hmm?  - Oh, my...

371
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:06,039
这里的人都是谁?
Who are all these other guys here?

372
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:08,319
- 我不知道  - 那这对你没影响吗?
- I don't know.  - And that doesn't bother you?

373
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:10,719
没有
Nope.

374
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:13,959
因为通常我都想要知道我要杀的到底是什么人
Because I usually like to know the person I'm killing needs to be dead.

375
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:16,560
所以你才永远爬不上高层 我的朋友
And that's why you never made it to the top shelf, my friend.

376
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:18,839
山羊胡 该你了
Goatee, you're up.

377
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:22,239
我在找那个会计 他什么时候回巴黎?
I'm looking for the accountant. When does he get back to Paris?

378
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,568
我不知道 我发誓
I don't know, I swear.

379
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:28,959
杀了他
Kill him.

380
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:31,359
等等 我有办法让他说
Hold on, I can get this guy to talk.

381
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:36,841
他不知道
He didn't know.

382
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:40,088
该死的
Goddamn it.

383
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:42,999
你有没有不能超过的底线?
Do you even have a line that can't be crossed?

384
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,799
我需要很多的加薪
I'm gonna need a significant raise.

385
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:54,959
我想多给我女儿留一点 不止是我那点儿可怜的抚恤金
I wanna leave my daughter more than just my shit pension.

386
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:57,959
听着 我可以给你两万五 但你得杀六个人
Look, I'll close at 25 but I'm gonna cap you to half a dozen kills.

387
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:59,599
六个?
Half a dozen?

388
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,599
我已经杀了三个了
I'm already halfway there.

389
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:04,167
我们都得勒紧裤腰带过日子
We've all been asked to tighten our belts.

390
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:11,399
别用这招儿 薇薇 你不是我的菜
Don't take this the wrong way, Viv, but you're not my type.

391
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:14,731
我是所有人的菜
I'm everybody's type.

392
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:21,319
- 你... 你确定这个管用?  - 不
- You... Are you sure this works?  - No.

393
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:24,444
但是我确定你如果不试试 那你两个月后必死无疑
But I am sure that if you don't try it, you'll be dead in two months.

394
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:30,359
我要五万 不是两万五
It's 50 thousand, not 25.

395
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:34,281
而且楼上那三个人你也得给我算进去
And you're giving me credit for those three guys upstairs.

396
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:38,599
我还想要...
And I'm also gonna want a...

397
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:42,359
我还要一百万的人寿保险
I'm gonna need a million dollar life insurance policy.

398
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:44,679
接不接受随你
Take it or leave it.

399
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:46,564
我接受
I'll take it.

400
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:50,130
我喜欢一锤子买卖
I like the package.

401
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:54,206
好了 动手吧
All right, now do it.

402
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:01,126
深呼吸 伊桑
Breathe, Ethan.

403
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:06,168
这个马上就能给你快感
It will hit you morphine-quick.

404
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:15,846
无论如何...
One way or another...

405
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:20,409
我会让你好受的
I will make you feel better.

406
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:54,202
别忘了用牛奶泡鱼
Don't forget to soak the fish.

407
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:02,839
你答应把自行车带回来的
You promised me my bike.

408
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:12,121
佐伊!
Zooey!

409
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:20,046
- 佐伊! 你还好吗?  - 不 我一点儿都不好
- Zooey! Are you OK?  - No, I'm not OK.

410
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:28,451
看看这个
Look at this.

411
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,644
看起来糟透了
This looks terrible.

412
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:36,359
我想你的... 你的头发?
I think your... Your hair?

413
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:40,319
不 不是 是的 没错 我的头发
No, no. Yes. Yes, my hair.

414
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:43,079
我看起来就像个诡异的稻草人
I look like a freaking Chia Pet.

415
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:46,479
看起来 呃 很不错
It looks, uh, awesome.

416
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:47,839
- 真的吗?  - 是的
- Really?  - Yeah.

417
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,559
你觉得这样能去舞会吗?
You think this can go to prom?

418
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:51,679
呃 如果你要去舞会的话 这发型也得跟着你去
Well, if you're going you might as well take it with you.

419
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:54,319
- 这是什么冷笑话吗?  - 不 不是 我的意思是...
- Oh, is that some kind of joke?  - No, no, I mean...

420
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:56,399
随便什么时候都行 不过现在是开玩笑的时候吗?
All these times, now's the time to say a joke?

421
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,090
不 我的意思是 也许...
No, I mean, maybe...

422
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:02,279
- 也许我们能弄好你的头发  - 弄好? 你能弄好吗?
- Maybe we can fix your hair.  - Fix it? You can fix this?

423
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:04,639
不 你可以... 你可以洗下头发...
No, you can... You could wash it...

424
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:08,359
然后压着头发睡一觉 明天就会...
You could sleep on it and, look, tomorrow it will be...

425
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:11,799
就会恢复正常了 不是吗? 也许?
It'll be back to normal, all right? Maybe?

426
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:13,879
- 你觉得真的可以吗?  - 是的
- You really think so?  - Yeah.

427
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,959
我们去吃晚饭吧?
Why don't we pick up some dinner?

428
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:23,645
嘿 如果你打算迟到三小时的话 就别答应做晚饭
Hey. Don't offer to cook dinner if you're going to be three hours late.

429
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:28,119
听着 我很抱歉 蒂娜 但是我...
Look, I'm sorry, Tina, but I was...

430
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:31,529
省省吧 我真是疯了才会指望你
Save it. I was crazy to think I could count on you.

431
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,999
我本来还打算让你在我去伦敦出差的时候照顾佐伊
I was gonna ask you to look after Zooey while I go to London for work.

432
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,239
那就去啊
Then, go.

433
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:39,319
真的 你应该去伦敦 我能搞定佐伊
Really, you should go, I can handle it.

434
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:42,319
你连晚餐都搞不定 怎么能搞定青少年?
You can't handle dinner. How are you gonna handle a teenager?

435
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:47,208
看她那头发 我刚刚才安抚完她 好吗?
How about I just diffused a major meltdown. Her hair, OK?

436
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:51,799
我必须乘坐明天早上第一班飞机出发
I have to take the first flight out tomorrow morning.

437
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:53,286
我打电话叫个保姆
I'm calling a sitter.

438
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:59,089
我迟到是因为我找到一个可以帮助我的医生
I was late because I found a doctor who can help me.

439
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:02,079
- 什么?  - 是这样...
- What?  - There's, um...

440
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:04,599
巴黎有个专家有一种实验性的药剂
There's a specialist here in Paris who has

441
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:07,531
她愿意在我身上测试一下
a experimental drug she's willing to test on me.

442
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:13,520
是实验性的
Experimental.

443
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:15,199
什么叫做实验性的?
What exactly does that mean?

444
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:19,325
实验性的意思是我也许能有更多的时间跟你和佐伊在一起
It means I might be able to spend a little more time with you and Zooey.

445
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:23,960
伊桑 你本该打电话的 因为我当时杀了你的心都有
You should have called, Ethan, because I was going to kill you.

446
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:31,199
我们就不能停战哪怕一秒钟吗
Can we just, like, maybe quit fighting for a second.

447
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:35,479
不要像这样谈论杀掉谁? 比如我
Maybe not talk about killing someone? Me.

448
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:39,639
那我就可以烤一下这些金枪鱼
I could grill us up some of this tuna.

449
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:41,399
- 金枪鱼?  - 没错
- Tuna?  - Yeah.

450
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:43,728
- 是金枪鱼  - 含贡的金枪鱼?
- Tuna.  - With all that mercury?

451
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:45,561
绝对不行!
No way!

452
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:52,439
你会修好那扇门的 对吗?
You're gonna fix that door, right?

453
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:54,688
噢 呃...
Oh. Um...

454
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:58,199
对 那扇门是个错误
Yeah, that was a mistake.

455
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:00,402
你才来了不到一天
You haven't been here 24 hours.

456
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:04,609
希望沙发会舒服一些
I hope the sofa is going to be comfortable.

457
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:09,563
肯定的 比卡拉奇的小床舒服多了
Yeah. Better than a cot in Karachi.

458
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:16,688
你需要什么安神助眠的吗?
Do you need something to help you sleep?

459
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:20,409
要 而且现在就要
Yeah, I'm gonna need it now.

460
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,281
你个混蛋
You're terrible.

461
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:01,599
我就知道你会打过来的
I knew you would call.

462
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:03,199
你到底给我注射了什么?
What the hell did you give me?

463
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:05,999
- 你不过来吗?  - 不 我头晕
- You're not coming over?  - No. I'm dizzy.

464
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,443
我的头... 头晕得厉害
My head... My head's dizzy.

465
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:11,759
薇薇
Vivi.

466
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:19,921
- 去看使用须知  - 等等! 我都开始产生幻觉了
- Read the manual.  - Wait! I'm hallucinating.

467
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:21,999
有幻觉在眼前
I'm hallucinating.

468
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,919
- 喝一杯伏特加  - 什么?
- Take a shot of vodka.  - What?

469
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:26,600
伏特加能减轻症状
Vodka. It'll take the edge off.

470
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:14,526
没事吧?
Is everything OK?

471
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:18,086
算是吧
Yeah.

472
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:27,282
- 伏特加有点儿难找  - 好吧
- I had a little trouble finding the vodka.  - Huh.

473
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:32,719
听着 你随时都可以给我打电话
Listen, you can call me anytime you want.

474
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:35,399
巴黎和伦敦只有一个小时的时差
It's only a one hour difference between Paris and London.

475
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:38,679
- 拿着这个  - 你也可以随时给我打电话
- There you are.  - And you can call me, too.

476
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:40,479
- 我爱你  - 知道了
- I love you.  - All right.

477
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:42,839
几天之后我就回来 我快要误机了
I'll be back in a couple of days, I'm running late.

478
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:45,039
- 你爸爸有张清单  - 内容丰富得很
- Your daddy has a list.  - Kind of a big list.

479
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:46,679
- 有洗衣粉...  - 几天之后再见了!
- Washing powder...  - I'll see you guys!

480
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:48,639
- 你们要好好的!  - 黑色衣服专用的
- Have fun!  - For black clothes.

481
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:51,241
佐伊 快来吃早餐
Zooey, come on, breakfast.

482
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:58,879
看我一眼 快
Look at me. Come on.

483
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:02,289
只看一眼 一眼就行
Just one time up here. One time.

484
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:07,041
这就对了
Atta girl.

485
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:09,241
佐伊！
Zooey!

486
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:17,119
哇哦
Oh.

487
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:18,479
怎么了?
What?

488
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:20,639
哇塞 这个...
Wow, it's...

489
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,559
- 怎么了?  - 天啊
- It's what?  - Geez.

490
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:25,366
- 伊桑 怎么了?  - 只不过...
- So, what, Ethan?  - It's...

491
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:28,319
有点儿太红了
It's so red.

492
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:30,090
薇薇?
Vivi?

493
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:33,079
你接不接这个电话?
Are you going to get that?

494
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:36,039
抱歉 这不重要 薇薇只是我的老板
Sorry. Nobody important, just my boss, Vivi.

495
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:38,319
是她在半夜里给你打电话吗?
Was she the one calling you in the middle of the night?

496
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:42,319
因为我们做的是国际贸易 所以经常打电话
We talk a lot because we sell internationally.

497
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:44,799
总会有些地方是工作时间的
It's always daytime somewhere.

498
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:48,039
好吧 现在我们有三天时间要消磨
All right, so now we've got three days to kill.

499
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:49,279
你在干什么?
What are you doing?

500
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:50,999
伊桑 这叫做来电铃声
It's called a ringtone, Ethan.

501
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,679
把我的铃声给你设置上
I'm giving you mine.

502
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:54,769
也许我们每年可以多聊几次
Maybe we can talk more than once a year.

503
00:41:57,960 --> 00:42:01,528
听听这个 欢迎来到21世纪
There. Welcome to this century.

504
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:06,887
佐伊 等等
Zooey. Zooey.

505
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:11,284
你难道不想骑车去学校吗?
Don't you want to ride your bike to school?

506
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,919
你觉得修会喜欢我头发的颜色吗?
You think Hugh's gonna like my hair color?

507
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:16,519
肯定的
Yes, I do.

508
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:17,879
- 真的吗?  - 没错
- Really?  - Yes.

509
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:20,879
- 你觉得他真的会喜欢吗?  - 呃 如果他在乎你的话 他会喜欢的
- You think he'll really love it?  - Well, if he cares about you he will.

510
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:22,759
那么你不喜欢这个颜色?
So you don't love it?

511
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:24,039
不喜欢
No.

512
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:26,359
不对 佐伊 我的意思是我喜欢
No, I mean, yes, Zooey.

513
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:29,325
佐伊 我真的喜欢
Zooey, I really love it.

514
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:32,369
说得太好了
Awesome.

515
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:50,359
看得出来你很不希望
I can see you don't believe in the customary

516
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:52,879
让我在下次行动之前休息两天
forty-eight-hour window between kills.

517
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:55,479
还行吧 你只剩下三天了
Well, you only have three days left.

518
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:58,199
薇薇 我是不会进车里的
I'm not getting into your car, Vivi.

519
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:03,239
除非你能告诉我之前你给我注射了什么
Not until I get a second opinion on that whatever it was you gave me.

520
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:06,999
- 我告诉你了是好东西  - 不 才不是
- I told you it's kosher.  - No, it's not.

521
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,599
- 哦  - 使用须知里面写了
- Aw.  - The manual says,

522
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:10,719
如果你也曾看过的话
if you'd bothered to read it,

523
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:13,079
你就会知道 上面说如果我的心跳加速
you'd find out if I can't keep my heart rate lower,

524
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:15,119
那玩意儿就会跟致幻剂一样
that shit's gonna act like a hallucinogen.

525
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:17,079
那就不要心跳加速
So keep your heart rate low.

526
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:19,851
说得容易 这对于你让我执行的任务来说有点困难
Yeah, well, it's kind of hard with the job you got me doing.

527
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:28,360
快点上车吧
Get in the car already.

528
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:34,879
我需要你确定给你那老朋友阿尔拜诺
I need you to locate the Italian accountant

529
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:37,287
伪造账本的意大利会计的位置
who cooks the books for your old friend the Albino.

530
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:42,519
我怎么能确定他的位置?
How am I supposed to locate this guy?

531
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:46,199
这个人会帮你 他叫米塔·伊尔马兹
With the help of this man. His name is Mitat Yilmaz.

532
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:49,131
他提供豪车轿车服务 阿尔拜诺是他的客户
He runs a limo service that caters to the Albino.

533
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:54,559
跟他熟悉一下 他会直接带你去找阿尔拜诺
Get to know him, he'll lead you straight to the accountant.

534
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:56,559
好吧
All right.

535
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:58,199
- 伊桑 还有件事  - 什么事?
- And, Ethan?  - Yeah?

536
00:43:58,200 --> 00:43:59,799
把自行车扔掉
Lose the bike.

537
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:03,129
- 买套西装  - 为什么?
- Buy a suit.  - Why?

538
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:11,800
宝贝儿 马跑了吗?

539
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:15,600
他来自断背山

540
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:21,079
你知道我们提供的是豪华轿车服务 对吧?
So, you understand we are a luxury car service, right?

541
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:23,279
- 没错  - 你是在哪里听说的我们?
- Yeah.  - How did you come to hear of us?

542
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:24,641
阿尔拜诺告诉我的
An Albino told me.

543
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:29,839
他有没有告诉你我们提供的是低调的奢华?
Did he also tell you that we offer discreet luxury?

544
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:34,959
他告诉我不要跟员工说话 直接找老板
He told me not to talk to the hired help, to talk to the boss.

545
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:38,079
我们不是员工 好吗? 我们是销售业务部副经理
We're not the help, OK? We are the executive vice president of sales.

546
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:39,700
这家伙是个疯子

547
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:42,445
你俩是一对人渣
You're a couple of turds.

548
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:45,500
什么是人渣?

549
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:47,300
应该是骂人的话

550
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:52,679
混蛋 听着...
Listen, asshole...

551
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:56,559
你才是个人渣 在我们眼里你什么都不是
little piece of turd, you're nobody to us.

552
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:58,559
你永远都别想见到老板 明白吗?
And you will never meet the boss. Understand?

553
00:44:58,560 --> 00:44:59,761
那好吧 我道歉
All right, I'm sorry.

554
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:00,679
继续
Yeah.

555
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:03,119
要知道 我昨晚睡得很不好
I had a really weird night, you know,

556
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:05,399
已经好几天了 可能时差没倒过来
a couple of weird nights. Jetlagged.

557
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:07,839
我觉得我们对彼此的第一印象都不怎么样 我的错
I think maybe we got off on the wrong foot. My fault.

558
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:09,599
没错
Yeah.

559
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:11,370
我们能重头再来一次吗?
Can we start again?

560
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:15,639
再来一次
Let's start again.

561
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:18,159
天啊 我开始觉得觉得在市区 哪里都能
Jesus Christ, I'm starting to think you can see the Eiffel Tower from

562
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:19,930
看到埃菲尔铁塔
everywhere in this town.

563
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:55,279
你擅自坐在我的位子上
You are a very rude man to sit behind my desk

564
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:58,519
这样非常粗鲁 你叫...?
without an invitation, Mr...?

565
00:45:58,520 --> 00:46:00,519
现在名字有那么重要吗?
Why are names important right now?

566
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:02,199
因为我不想杀一个素不相识的人
Because I don't want to kill a total stranger.

567
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:04,209
米塔 你想为了什么杀我?
What do you want to kill me for, Mitat?

568
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:08,599
因为你坐在我的椅子上
You are sitting in my chair.

569
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:10,239
我只是在等你
I'm just waiting for you.

570
00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:24,239
阿尔拜诺让你来的? 混蛋!
The Albino sent you, huh? Bastard!

571
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:26,920
我一直都忠心不二 求求你...
I've always been loyal. Please...

572
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:33,679
- 照片里是你的女儿们吗?  - 谁让你看这张照片的?!
- These your girls in the picture?  - How dare you look at them?!

573
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:37,639
坐下 我也有个青春期的掌上明珠
Sit down. I also have a pretty teenage daughter.

574
00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:40,839
大家都是当爸的 说实话
Father to father, your girls ever

575
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:43,719
你的女儿们有没有把自己锁在房间里?
lock themselves in their room, you know?

576
00:46:43,720 --> 00:46:46,799
还剪短头发 染成红色?
Cut their hair, paint it red, you know?

577
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:49,207
戴上假发那种乱七八糟的东西
Put wigs on and shit like that?

578
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:51,600
绝对不可能
No. Never.

579
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:55,559
我就知道! 我有麻烦了
I knew it! I'm in trouble.

580
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:03,039
- 这么说阿尔拜诺没有派你来杀我?  - 没有
- So the Albino didn't send you to kill me?  - No.

581
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:07,526
那你到底是谁?
Then who are you?

582
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,248
我是伊桑 跟我来
Ethan. Come on.

583
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:17,050
# 追寻灵魂 #
# Soul searching #

584
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:21,959
# 没有任何作用 #
# Ain't no finer groove #

585
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:26,879
# 追寻灵魂 #
# Soul searching #

586
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:29,239
# 让你一刻不停 #
# Gonna make you move #

587
00:47:29,240 --> 00:47:30,559
# 就那样吧 #
# Well #

588
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:33,199
我打算在厕所里跟这个人说点事儿
I'm gonna have a conversation with this man in the bathroom.

589
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:35,839
我不希望被打扰
I do not want to be disturbed.

590
00:47:35,840 --> 00:47:40,159
好的 第二条规矩 你怎么说 我怎么做
Yes. Rule #2: Do whatever you say.

591
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:41,679
第二条规矩 这就对了
That's right, Rule #2.

592
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:44,199
- 他是坏人吗?  - 差不多吧
- He's a bad guy?  - Something like that.

593
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:46,448
那你是好人吗?
And you are a good guy?

594
00:47:52,680 --> 00:47:54,639
你是职业杀手 对吧?
You are a professional, huh?

595
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:57,079
为什么我以前从没在巴黎见过你?
Why have I never seen you in Paris before?

596
00:47:57,080 --> 00:47:59,399
我出去做生意差不多有五年的时间
I've been away on business for about five years.

597
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:03,241
什么重要的事儿让你离开女儿这么久?
What is so important that you'd leave your daughter so long?

598
00:48:06,120 --> 00:48:10,041
工作家庭两不误从来都不是我的强项
Well, I was never good at balancing work and family.

599
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:15,439
要知道 当我回到家的时候
You know, when I go home,

600
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:19,804
这种生活和杀戮都烟消云散了
this life, the killing, the rest it all disappears.

601
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:24,203
当时离开是个错误的选择
I made the wrong choice leaving.

602
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:30,119
每天我都送女儿上学 跟家人一起晚餐
Everyday I bring my girls to school and I have dinner with my family.

603
00:48:30,120 --> 00:48:31,162
这才是最重要的
That's the key.

604
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:33,799
米塔 这真不错
Oh, good for you, Mitat.

605
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:35,999
那就不要让我们错过今天的晚餐 怎么样?
So let's not miss dinner tonight, hmm?

606
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:41,604
那个会计什么时候到巴黎?
When is the accountant arriving in Paris?

607
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:46,489
请再跟我说一次 你在说谁?
Please remind me, who is he again?

608
00:48:57,800 --> 00:49:00,679
- 喂?  - 喂 我是德里斯克夫人
- Hello?  - Hello, Mrs. Driskal here.

609
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:02,882
我想跟佐伊的父亲说几句话
I'd like to have a word with Zooey's father.

610
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:09,119
我就是佐伊的父亲 她没事吧?
I'm Zooey's father. Is she all right?

611
00:49:09,120 --> 00:49:11,359
佐伊很好 但我们需要见个面
Zooey's fine, but we need to meet.

612
00:49:11,360 --> 00:49:14,319
来讨论一下佐伊的在校表现
We need to have a conversation about Zooey's behavior.

613
00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:17,999
我马上就到
I can be there right away.

614
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,326
好的 请尽快
Well, do hurry.

615
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:24,840
咱们这就去学校
We're going to school.

616
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:26,719
我一直都在对佐伊说
As I was saying to Zooey,

617
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:29,239
诸多研究都显示
study after study has shown that

618
00:49:29,240 --> 00:49:33,839
流行文化中的暴力因素会加强人的攻击性
aggression is exacerbated by violent images in popular culture.

619
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:36,279
佐伊的母亲是朝着和平主义者的方向来培养她的
Well, Zooey's mother raised her to be a pacifist.

620
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:37,599
是吗
Hm.

621
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:41,930
打同学的脸很难算是和平主义者的行为
Hitting a classmate in the face is hardly a passive response.

622
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:50,809
是扇了一巴掌还是打了一拳?
With an open hand or a clenched fist?

623
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:54,919
- 这有什么区别吗?  - 以我的经验来看
- What difference does that make?  - Well, from my experience,

624
00:49:54,920 --> 00:49:58,439
气愤 沮丧 侮辱 这些...
anger, frustration, insult, they all call for...

625
00:49:58,440 --> 00:50:00,404
都会导致不同的应对方式
they all call for different responses.

626
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:04,719
雷纳先生 向您的女儿
Mr. Renner, it's extremely important

627
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:07,559
清楚传递这个信息很重要
that you send your daughter a clear message

628
00:50:07,560 --> 00:50:11,399
那就是无论她必须在生活中面对什么
that no matter what she has to confront in life

629
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:15,679
采取暴力手段都让人无法忍受
violence is not an acceptable answer.

630
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:17,166
我会试试看
I'll try.

631
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:25,879
伊桑 你说的那些话真是既奇怪又让人尴尬
If that wasn't so weird, it would have been really embarrassing, Ethan.

632
00:50:25,880 --> 00:50:27,759
- 给我看看你的手  - 什么?
- Let me see your hand.  - What?

633
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:29,610
佐伊 给我看看你的手
Let me see your hand, Zooey.

634
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:33,159
大拇指好痛
Ow, my thumb.

635
00:50:33,160 --> 00:50:35,319
如果你打算给别人一拳的话
If you're gonna hit someone with a clenched fist

636
00:50:35,320 --> 00:50:38,719
确保不要把大拇指攥在手心
be sure to not tuck your thumb in.

637
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:42,322
你离开了五年的时间 这就是你要对我说的吗?
You've been gone for five years and this is what you say to me?

638
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:49,081
天啊
Oh, God.

639
00:50:54,680 --> 00:50:56,359
- 你是穆斯林吗?  - 不是
- Are you Muslim?  - No.

640
00:50:56,360 --> 00:50:58,039
我说了 这是我老板的车
I told you this is my boss's car.

641
00:50:58,040 --> 00:51:00,599
- 所以说薇薇是个穆斯林?  - 不
- Oh, so Vivi's Muslim?  - No.

642
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:04,079
- 还是插我的手机吧 这音乐难听死了  - 我也觉得
- I'm plugging in my phone. This stuff sucks.  - I know.

643
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:08,799
挺好听的 谁唱的啊?
I like this, who are these guys?

644
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:11,959
- 你是不是根本不在乎我为什么要打人?  - 放我出去!
- Do you even care why I got into a fight?  - Let me out!

645
00:51:13,480 --> 00:51:16,319
你怎么就不能好好听我说 理解我呢?
Why can't you just listen to me and try to understand?

646
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:18,363
好吧 跟我说说吧
OK, why don't you tell me all about it?

647
00:51:19,960 --> 00:51:22,439
我交了个新朋友 巴基斯坦人
I have a new friend from Pakistan,

648
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:25,959
有个英国女生一直叫她巴基佬
and there's this British girl who keeps calling her Paki.

649
00:51:25,960 --> 00:51:28,919
今天她又把培根放在她的储物柜里 所以我就朝她脸上揍了一拳
Today she put bacon in her locker, so I hit her in the face.

650
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:30,999
那至少她下次不敢了 不是吗?
Well, she won't do that again, will she?

651
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:38,165
等一下 宝贝 听着好像是后备箱的备胎松了
Just a second, sweetie, sounds like the spare's loose in the trunk.

652
00:51:39,240 --> 00:51:40,646
嘿!
Hey!

653
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:44,841
我在努力跟我女儿谈心呢
I'm trying to have a conversation with my daughter.

654
00:51:47,240 --> 00:51:50,759
抱... 抱歉 宝贝 刚才说到哪儿了?
I'm... I'm sorry, sweetie, now where were we?

655
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:54,159
- 揍了她一拳 对吧?  - 我感觉很糟糕
- Punching the girl, right?  - I feel really bad.

656
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:58,399
没必要啊 因为有时候以暴方可制暴
Well, don't, because sometimes it's the only way to stop a bad guy.

657
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:01,279
- 所以你不生我的气?  - 不啊
- So you're not mad at me?  - No, I'm not mad at you.

658
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:03,323
我为你自豪 你为自己的朋友两肋插刀
I'm proud of you, you stuck up for your friend.

659
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:06,124
算了吧 我坐地铁去
Whatever. I'm taking the metro.

660
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:08,879
- 伊桑?  - 嗯
- And, Ethan?  - Yeah.

661
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:12,209
快找点药治治你那咳嗽吧 听着难过死了
You might want to take something for that cough. It's really annoying.

662
00:52:14,600 --> 00:52:15,926
老天!
Jesus Christ!

663
00:52:19,160 --> 00:52:21,727
看看咱们能不能让你快速回忆起来 米塔
Let's see if we can jump start your memory, Mitat.

664
00:52:30,560 --> 00:52:34,119
是我女儿的电话
It's my daughter.

665
00:52:34,120 --> 00:52:36,919
- 佐伊?  - 之前对不起啊
- Zooey?  - Hey. Sorry about earlier.

666
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:40,090
没事的 宝贝 我也很抱歉
That's OK, honey. I'm sorry, too.

667
00:52:41,160 --> 00:52:43,479
来放学后最喜欢去的地方吗?
Favorite place to hang out after school?

668
00:52:45,560 --> 00:52:49,845
我很快就开好销售大会了 三点半见 宝贝
I'll wrap my sales meeting and meet you at 3:30, sweetie.

669
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:55,331
她刚才叫我陪她出去 你觉得怎么样?
She just invited me to hang out. What do you think about that?

670
00:52:55,880 --> 00:52:58,799
这种姑娘会牵着你的鼻子走
A girl like this will keep you running in circles.

671
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:02,083
你必须划清底线 绝不能心慈手软
You must draw the line, not be so soft.

672
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:06,569
说得在理 米塔
You're right, Mitat.

673
00:53:08,440 --> 00:53:10,199
我的确是太心慈手软了
I have been way too soft.

674
00:53:12,520 --> 00:53:15,439
说吧 我去哪儿找阿尔拜诺的会计?
Now, where do I find the Albino's accountant, hmm?

675
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:27,319
嗨 佐伊
Hi, Zooey.

676
00:54:27,320 --> 00:54:29,519
都三点四十了 伊桑 你在哪儿呢?
It's 3:40, Ethan. Where are you?

677
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:31,759
我在自行车上呢 宝贝儿
I'm on my bike, sweetie.

678
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:33,639
算了吧 你总是迟到 我走了
Forget it, you're always late. I'm leaving.

679
00:54:33,640 --> 00:54:36,119
别别别 我快到了 没骗你 佐伊
No, no, no, I'm almost there, honestly, Zooey.

680
00:54:36,120 --> 00:54:37,765
等我...
Give me...

681
00:54:38,800 --> 00:54:40,439
等我五分钟
Give me five minutes.

682
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:43,405
好 五分钟 我还要做作业呢
Fine, five minutes. I have homework.

683
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:46,241
唉
Wow.

684
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:49,439
孩子啊
Kids.

685
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:20,239
抱歉我之前发火了
Sorry I freaked out earlier.

686
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:24,719
只是修 毕业舞会还有你回来这么多事都碰到一起
It's just Hugh and the prom and you came into town.

687
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:27,559
这对你我都不太习惯 我懂
This is really new for both of us. I get it.

688
00:55:27,560 --> 00:55:31,479
那么 坐完飞椅之后最喜欢去的地方还记得吗?
So, favorite place to go after Flying Chairs, you remember?

689
00:55:31,480 --> 00:55:32,919
- 记得  - 快忘了吧?
- I remember.  - Kind of?

690
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:34,610
- 嗯  - 好
- Yeah.  - OK.

691
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:37,925
天啊 这自行车
Gosh, the bike.

692
00:56:02,120 --> 00:56:03,924
到底怎么了 伊桑?
What's going on, Ethan?

693
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:09,199
不小心得的流感
It's just some flu I picked up.

694
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:11,359
怎么也好不了
Can't seem to shake it off.

695
00:56:11,360 --> 00:56:12,720
万一情况更糟糕呢?
What if it's something worse?

696
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:15,799
不 呃...
No, it's, uh...

697
00:56:15,800 --> 00:56:18,844
就是普通的流感
It's nothing worse.

698
00:56:20,320 --> 00:56:23,159
还记得我们在沙滩屋喝热巧克力吗?
You remember when we'd drink hot chocolate at the beach house?

699
00:56:23,160 --> 00:56:24,679
有点儿印象
Sort of.

700
00:56:24,680 --> 00:56:26,719
只有那儿我觉得能称之为家
It's the one place I wouldn't mind calling home.

701
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:29,120
- 真的吗 比匹兹堡还亲切?  - 是啊 比匹兹堡还棒
- More than Pittsburgh, really?  - Yeah, more than Pittsburgh.

702
00:56:30,680 --> 00:56:34,123
你知道吗 我把所有的家庭录像都收集在一个箱子里
You know, I kept all our home movies in a box.

703
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:38,959
今晚一起做晚饭 看录像如何?
How about we make dinner and watch them tonight?

704
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:42,369
- 好啊 太棒了  - 好
- Yeah, that'd be awesome.  - Good.

705
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:47,119
该死 差点忘了 我今晚得去卡琳娜家
Oh, shoot, I forgot. I have to go to Karina's tonight.

706
00:56:47,120 --> 00:56:49,319
- 谁?  - 卡琳娜 她是我的实验搭档
- Who?  - Karina, she's my lab partner.

707
00:56:49,320 --> 00:56:52,999
我们一起做一个科学项目 我今晚在她那儿过夜
We're doing a science project together. I'm going to spend the night.

708
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,999
- 工作日晚上还这样?  - 嗯 对不起 伊桑 真的对不起
- On a school night?  - Yeah. I'm sorry, Ethan, I'm really sorry.

709
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,719
没事 只是...
No, it's OK. It's just...

710
00:56:58,720 --> 00:57:00,759
我需不需要先给她父母去个电话?
Don't I need to call her parents first?

711
00:57:00,760 --> 00:57:02,839
行啊 要是你会说俄语的话
Yeah, if you speak Russian.

712
00:57:02,840 --> 00:57:05,439
她父母除了俄语啥也不会
That's all her parents understand.

713
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:07,159
跟妈妈说吧 她会告诉你没事的
Look, call Mom. She'll tell you it's cool.

714
00:57:07,160 --> 00:57:10,091
不需要跟你妈确认
I don't need to call your mom.

715
00:57:11,400 --> 00:57:13,762
- 那咱们明天看录像行吗?  - 好啊 没问题
- Can we watch those movies tomorrow?  - Yeah, sure.

716
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:16,524
拜拜
See you later.

717
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:21,519
嗨 我是克里斯汀 现在不在 请留言
Hi, this is Christine, I'm not here, so please leave a message.

718
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:23,370
蒂娜 是我
Tina, it's me.

719
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:28,359
你相信吗 我和佐伊刚坐过飞椅
Can you believe Zooey and I hung out on flying chairs

720
00:57:28,360 --> 00:57:32,559
然后喝了热巧克力 而且都是她提出来的?
and we had hot chocolate and it was her idea?

721
00:57:32,560 --> 00:57:38,369
谢谢你 蒂娜 你真的是个好妈妈
Thanks for all this, Tina. You're a really great mom.

722
00:59:55,160 --> 00:59:57,799
嗨 听到你们相处顺利我很高兴
Hi, I'm thrilled everything's going so well.

723
00:59:57,800 --> 00:59:59,559
但那个朋友是谁?
But, uh, who is this friend?

724
00:59:59,560 --> 01:00:02,159
我从没听说过她 也没听说过什么俄国父母
Well, I've never heard of her nor her Russian parents.

725
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:03,850
无论如何 给我来个电话
Anyways, give me a call.

726
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:30,284
佐伊!
Zooey!

727
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:03,884
没看到
Non, non.

728
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:46,489
该死的!
Son of a bitch!

729
01:02:03,040 --> 01:02:04,651
这是你的车吗?
Is this your car?

730
01:02:07,960 --> 01:02:11,159
打扰了... 这是你的车吗?
Pardon... Is this your car?

731
01:02:11,160 --> 01:02:12,600
- 哇  - 不是
- Whoa.  - No.

732
01:02:50,040 --> 01:02:53,119
嘿! 你懂规矩的
Hey! You know the rule.

733
01:02:53,120 --> 01:02:54,599
不要把家庭卷进来
Never involve family.

734
01:02:54,600 --> 01:02:56,999
不是谈公事 米塔 只是...
This isn't a business meeting, Mitat, this is...

735
01:02:59,960 --> 01:03:03,639
两个父亲之间的对话
This is more of a father-to-father type of visit.

736
01:03:03,640 --> 01:03:05,444
- 现在是晚饭时间  - 米塔?
- It's dinner time.  - Mitat?

737
01:03:11,280 --> 01:03:14,245
- 你认识他吗 米塔?  - 嗯 我们是同事
- Do you know this man, Mitat?  - Yeah, we work together.

738
01:03:15,560 --> 01:03:18,331
- 从没见过他嘛  - 他是美国人
- Never seen him before.  - It's an American.

739
01:03:23,560 --> 01:03:26,719
好 进来吧
OK. Come, come with us.

740
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:27,919
还真谢谢你揍我一顿
Thanks for that.

741
01:03:27,920 --> 01:03:30,479
这是瑞秋和萨拉
This is Rachelle, Sarah.

742
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:32,999
我跟我女儿佐伊闹了矛盾
I have a serious problem with my daughter, Zooey.

743
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,959
你都走了五年了 还以为不会有点矛盾吗?
You've been gone for five years and you did not expect trouble?

744
01:03:35,960 --> 01:03:38,279
- 我们帮不到你  - 没错 你大概是没什么用
- We cannot help you.  - That's right, you probably can't.

745
01:03:38,280 --> 01:03:40,039
但你女儿或许可以告诉我
But your girls might be able to tell me where

746
01:03:40,040 --> 01:03:43,528
一个工作日的晚上 一个十六岁少女会去哪里狂欢
a 16-year-old would go to party on a school night.

747
01:03:45,080 --> 01:03:47,886
这个"蜘蛛"是什么意思?
What does this "spider" mean?

748
01:03:50,520 --> 01:03:53,519
她们很懂事的 不参加派对
They are good girls, they do not party.

749
01:03:53,520 --> 01:03:55,210
这个"蜘蛛"是什么意思?
What does this "spider" mean?

750
01:03:58,520 --> 01:03:59,879
舞会屋
La Soiree House.

751
01:03:59,880 --> 01:04:02,199
- 你们怎么知道的?  - 谢谢
- How do you know that?  - Thank you.

752
01:04:06,240 --> 01:04:09,728
我女儿在里面
I have a daughter in there.

753
01:04:26,080 --> 01:04:27,469
佐伊
Zooey.

754
01:04:27,880 --> 01:04:28,700
想跳舞吗?

755
01:04:28,800 --> 01:04:29,887
好
Oui.

756
01:04:42,900 --> 01:04:44,187
带她走

757
01:04:54,320 --> 01:04:55,521
佐伊!
Zooey!

758
01:05:09,320 --> 01:05:11,170
别 住手 求你们了
Stop, please, please.

759
01:05:15,220 --> 01:05:16,670
厕所关了 二位

760
01:05:18,320 --> 01:05:20,070
回去吧

761
01:05:23,560 --> 01:05:24,886
别 求求你们
Stop, please.

762
01:05:34,320 --> 01:05:35,681
伊桑!
Ethan!

763
01:05:38,920 --> 01:05:40,201
伊桑!
Ethan!

764
01:05:45,920 --> 01:05:47,565
伊桑! 快救我!
Ethan! Please!

765
01:05:47,665 --> 01:05:48,665
你干嘛?

766
01:06:09,960 --> 01:06:12,003
来 佐伊 来吧
Come on, Zooey. Come on.

767
01:06:13,800 --> 01:06:15,081
有我在 宝贝
I got you, honey.

768
01:06:39,040 --> 01:06:40,446
你在这儿干什么呢?
What are you doing here?

769
01:06:42,280 --> 01:06:45,324
应该换我问 佐伊 你昨晚在那儿干什么呢?
Better question, Zooey, is, what were you doing last night?

770
01:06:48,720 --> 01:06:52,288
天啊 太尴尬了 他们再也不会让我进去了
God, this is so embarrassing. They'll never let me in there again.

771
01:06:53,760 --> 01:06:57,199
你为什么还想回那种地方去?
Why would you ever want to go back to a place like that?

772
01:06:57,200 --> 01:06:59,599
因为我喜欢跟朋友待在一起
Because I like being with my friends.

773
01:06:59,600 --> 01:07:01,039
朋友?
Your friends?

774
01:07:01,040 --> 01:07:03,561
你是不是根本不记得昨晚的事了?
Do you even remember what happened?

775
01:07:06,080 --> 01:07:07,725
在厕所里事?
In the bathroom?

776
01:07:11,240 --> 01:07:12,679
- 佐伊!  - 什么?
- Zooey!  - What?

777
01:07:12,680 --> 01:07:15,319
你还记得在厕所发生了什么事吗?
In the bathroom, do you remember what happened?

778
01:07:15,320 --> 01:07:18,126
听着 卡琳娜和我搞定了功课 明白吗?
Look, Karina and I aced the practice test, OK?

779
01:07:19,800 --> 01:07:21,759
- 胡说八道  - 真的搞定了
- No, you didn't.  - Yes, we did.

780
01:07:21,760 --> 01:07:24,167
所以我们决定去和朋友出去玩
So we decided to go hang out with some friends.

781
01:07:25,520 --> 01:07:27,679
我得去赶地铁了 上学要迟到了
I've gotta go catch the metro, I'm gonna be late for school.

782
01:07:27,680 --> 01:07:30,399
- 不许去坐地铁  - 什么?
- You're not going to the metro.  - What?

783
01:07:30,400 --> 01:07:33,365
今天不许去学校 穿成这样绝对不允许
You're not going to school today. Not dressed like that.

784
01:07:34,480 --> 01:07:37,799
把这个穿上 我们回家
You're putting this on and we're going home.

785
01:07:37,800 --> 01:07:40,799
- 咱们得好好谈谈  - 那我怎么回家呢?
- We're gonna have a talk.  - How exactly am I supposed to get home?

786
01:07:40,800 --> 01:07:42,999
- 骑这辆车  - 想都不要想 伊桑
- Gonna ride this bike.  - I don't think so, Ethan.

787
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,559
上车 然后我一步一步跟着你回去
You're getting on this bike and I'm gonna follow you every step of the way.

788
01:07:45,560 --> 01:07:48,879
- 想都别想  - 闭嘴 上车
- No, you're not.  - Stop talking and get on the bike.

789
01:07:48,880 --> 01:07:51,399
你不是说要谈谈吗 伊桑!
I thought that's what you wanted to do, Ethan, talk!

790
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:53,439
上车
Get on this bike.

791
01:07:53,440 --> 01:07:55,529
- 不然呢?  - 快!
- Or what?  - Now!

792
01:07:58,720 --> 01:08:01,207
我根本都不会骑车 好吗?
I don't even know how to ride a bike, OK?

793
01:08:09,400 --> 01:08:12,365
什么样的孩子连车都不会骑?
What kind of kid doesn't know how to ride a bike?

794
01:08:16,840 --> 01:08:20,522
没爹教的孩子
The kind of kid who never had a father to teach her.

795
01:08:26,680 --> 01:08:28,450
该死的
Goddamn it.

796
01:08:29,640 --> 01:08:31,959
这儿是平地 就在这儿试试吧
This is the flattest spot, so let's just try it right here.

797
01:08:31,960 --> 01:08:33,919
天啊 你怎么非搞个最大的车?
Gosh, did you have to get the biggest bike there?

798
01:08:33,920 --> 01:08:38,079
这不是最大的 佐伊  这是女式自行车
It's not the biggest bike, Zooey, it's a girl's bike.

799
01:08:38,080 --> 01:08:40,439
好吧 你选了它是因为有个大蝴蝶结
Right, you picked it 'cause it had the big bow on it.

800
01:08:40,440 --> 01:08:44,719
不 大蝴蝶结是有理由的 我知道了 上来吧
No. I can explain the big bow, I got it. Get on.

801
01:08:44,720 --> 01:08:47,879
好多人 听着 咱们能去个人少点儿的地方吗?
There's too many people. Look, can we go somewhere private?

802
01:08:47,880 --> 01:08:49,764
- 天啊  - 没多少人嘛
- Gosh.  - There's not too many people.

803
01:08:51,200 --> 01:08:52,686
但它是紫色的
But it's purple.

804
01:08:54,480 --> 01:08:57,119
它的确是紫色的 上来吧
It is purple. Get on.

805
01:08:57,120 --> 01:09:00,961
- 到底怎么上去啊?  - 上来就行了嘛
- How do you even get on it?  - Just get on.

806
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:04,039
看 好的开始是成功的一半 上来了
Wow, we did it. We're halfway there. We're on it.

807
01:09:05,240 --> 01:09:08,919
别急着推 明白? 现在就行了 好吗?
Give yourself time to push here, OK? It's right here then. All right?

808
01:09:08,920 --> 01:09:10,239
佐伊 好了
Zooey, all right.

809
01:09:10,240 --> 01:09:11,851
- 哇 行了吗?  - 行了

811
01:09:14,920 --> 01:09:17,079
好了 我抓住你了 现在就... 你知道怎么踩踏板的
OK, I have you. Now, just kinda, you know how to pedal.

812
01:09:17,080 --> 01:09:19,442
- 没错 我就在这儿呢  - 座位怎么这么高啊?
- Yes. I'm right here.  - Why is it so high?

813
01:09:20,440 --> 01:09:22,529
别放手 我要...
Don't let go. I'm gonna...

814
01:09:27,520 --> 01:09:30,166
你为什么离开我们 伊桑?
Why did you leave us, Ethan?

815
01:09:31,160 --> 01:09:32,885
你为什么离开我和妈妈?
Why did you leave me and Mom?

816
01:09:34,680 --> 01:09:37,719
听着 我四处出差 宝贝 你妈妈和我...
Look, I traveled a lot, sweetheart, and your mother and I...

817
01:09:37,720 --> 01:09:39,649
怎么了?
What?

818
01:09:40,480 --> 01:09:42,444
怎么说呢...
There is no easy...

819
01:09:44,600 --> 01:09:46,484
三言两语说不清楚 宝贝
There's no good answer, honey.

820
01:09:50,440 --> 01:09:51,599
好吧
All right.

821
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:55,559
- 你有新家庭了吗?  - 没有 宝贝 没有 别这么说
- Do you have another family?  - No. No, sweetheart. I didn't. Come on.

822
01:09:55,560 --> 01:09:56,919
你有新家庭了吗?
Do you have another family?

823
01:09:56,920 --> 01:09:58,079
- 就因为这个是吗?  - 不
- Is that what it is?  - No.

824
01:09:58,080 --> 01:10:00,079
你在别的地方还有个满分女儿是不是?
Do you have another perfect daughter somewhere?

825
01:10:00,080 --> 01:10:02,119
你来看我却并不想要我?
Did you see me and not want me?

826
01:10:02,120 --> 01:10:04,721
- 你不爱我吗?  - 当然爱 宝贝 不是那样
- Do you not love me?  - No, sweetheart, no, that's not it.

827
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:11,481
那你为什么花了那么久才回来?
Well, why did it take so long for you to come back?

828
01:10:12,440 --> 01:10:13,839
瞧!
Look!

829
01:10:13,840 --> 01:10:15,599
我离开得越久...
The longer I was gone...

830
01:10:15,600 --> 01:10:18,770
就感觉回家的路越难走
it felt like the harder it was to come back.

831
01:10:29,800 --> 01:10:32,162
好了 好了
OK, OK, all right.

832
01:10:33,840 --> 01:10:37,567
就这样吧 完全不是你的错
That's all. It's nothing to do with you.

833
01:10:39,640 --> 01:10:42,439
要是我做了坏事 你还会在乎我吗?
Would you still care about me if I did horrible things?

834
01:10:42,440 --> 01:10:43,926
当然
Yes, of course.

835
01:10:45,040 --> 01:10:47,559
绝对的
Absolutely.

836
01:10:47,560 --> 01:10:51,159
我经常撒谎 其实 我不管什么事都爱撒谎
I lie a lot. Like, all the time about everything.

837
01:10:51,160 --> 01:10:53,799
就连不需要也撒 我也不知道为什么
Even when I don't need to. I don't know why.

838
01:10:53,800 --> 01:10:58,879
有时候撒谎比说实话轻松得多
Well, you know, sometimes that's easier than telling the truth.

839
01:10:58,880 --> 01:11:02,399
我在学校打的那个姑娘 她并没有嘲讽什么巴基斯坦朋友
That girl I hit at school, she wasn't teasing a Pakistani friend.

840
01:11:02,400 --> 01:11:04,479
她在勾搭修
She was hitting on Hugh.

841
01:11:04,480 --> 01:11:06,679
- 也没关系 他更喜欢足球  - 嗯
- It's all right, he prefers soccer.  - Yeah.

842
01:11:06,680 --> 01:11:08,006
修!
Hugh!

843
01:11:10,280 --> 01:11:12,479
太美了 谢谢你!
These are so beautiful, thank you!

844
01:11:12,480 --> 01:11:14,599
等我一下 我马上回来
Give me one sec, I'll be right back.

845
01:11:14,600 --> 01:11:17,007
伊桑 别说奇怪的话
Ethan, don't say anything weird.

846
01:11:21,600 --> 01:11:24,599
- 你会通宵狂欢吗 修?  - 什么?
- You rave, Hugh?  - What?

847
01:11:24,600 --> 01:11:28,199
- 你通宵狂欢吗?  - 不 从不 佐伊先生
- You rave?  - No, no way, Mr. Zoe.

848
01:11:28,200 --> 01:11:31,239
我是个运动员 我踢前锋
I'm an athlete. I'm a striker.

849
01:11:31,240 --> 01:11:33,602
顺便一提 上场比赛我进了两个球
Last game I scored two goals, by the way.

850
01:11:34,680 --> 01:11:38,327
- 看来你喜欢进球咯?  - 嗯 当然喜欢了
- So you like to score?  - Yeah, yeah, definitely, yeah.

851
01:11:38,960 --> 01:11:42,559
不是! 我的意思是... 在赛场上
No! Well, I... I... I mean on the field.

852
01:11:42,560 --> 01:11:44,439
- 哦  - 嗯 只在赛场上
- Yeah.  - On the field only, yeah.

853
01:11:44,440 --> 01:11:47,159
- 足球?  - 对啊
- Soccer?  - Yeah.

854
01:11:47,160 --> 01:11:50,919
不喜欢足球 我从匹兹堡来的 我们那儿都打真正的橄榄球
Not a fan. I'm from Pittsburgh, where we play real football.

855
01:11:50,920 --> 01:11:54,203
- 啊 美式足球  - 不对
- Oh yeah, American football.  - No.

856
01:11:54,880 --> 01:11:56,445
真正的橄榄球
Real football.

857
01:11:58,600 --> 01:11:59,801
好吧
OK.

858
01:12:03,560 --> 01:12:04,999
自行车不错
Nice bike.

859
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:06,959
- 你喜欢?  - 嗯
- You like the bike?  - Yeah.

860
01:12:06,960 --> 01:12:08,491
就你一个人喜欢
You're the only one.

861
01:12:11,360 --> 01:12:14,159
我不会回来晚的 伊桑
I won't be home late, Ethan.

862
01:12:14,160 --> 01:12:17,679
- 你们俩去哪儿?  - 学校
- Where are you two going? - School.

863
01:12:17,680 --> 01:12:19,879
太好了 正好我也要去那边
Great, well, I'm headed that direction myself.

864
01:12:19,880 --> 01:12:21,359
你才不去那边
No, you're not.

865
01:12:21,360 --> 01:12:23,599
我可以去 我要去市场
Yeah, well, I could be. I'm going to the market.

866
01:12:23,600 --> 01:12:25,839

Oh, OK, well, I'm gonna...

867
01:12:25,840 --> 01:12:28,520
一会儿见 佐伊先生
OK, see you later, Mr. Zooey.

868
01:12:29,960 --> 01:12:31,839
我不喜欢别人这么叫我
I don't like being called that.

869
01:12:31,840 --> 01:12:33,319
你不喜欢修?
You don't like Hugh?

870
01:12:33,320 --> 01:12:37,239
宝贝 我是搞销售的
I'm in, uh, sales, sweetie.

871
01:12:37,240 --> 01:12:40,959
我很会看人
It's my business to read people.

872
01:12:40,960 --> 01:12:43,399
你要知道 伊桑 我有很多同学的爸爸都搞销售
You know, a lot of my friends' dads are in sales, Ethan,

873
01:12:43,400 --> 01:12:46,119
但没有一个穿得跟你一样
and not one of them dresses like you.

874
01:12:46,120 --> 01:12:49,319
你什么意思?
What are you saying?

875
01:12:49,320 --> 01:12:52,603
我是说他们都穿西装去上班
I'm saying they wear suits. That's what they wear to work.

876
01:12:59,720 --> 01:13:01,843
嘿 爱你们哟!
Hey, I love you!

877
01:13:04,920 --> 01:13:09,045
- 我还没帮够你吗?  - 你知道该怎么做
- Haven't I helped you enough?  - You know the drill.

878
01:13:09,360 --> 01:13:12,279
那个会计从酒店退房走了 我需要你告诉我他现在在哪儿
The accountant checked out. I need you to tell me where he is now.

879
01:13:12,280 --> 01:13:14,479
- 我昨天已经告诉你了  - 我记得
- I gave him to you yesterday.  - I know you did.

880
01:13:14,480 --> 01:13:16,919
现在你又回来了 我以为你是专业的
And now you're back. I thought you were a pro.

881
01:13:16,920 --> 01:13:20,559
我突然要做单身父亲 情况很复杂
I'm suddenly a single dad. It's getting complicated.

882
01:13:20,560 --> 01:13:23,759
你那不受控制的女儿影响了你的工作和判断力
Is it my fault if your daughter is out of control

883
01:13:23,760 --> 01:13:25,519
这也算我的问题?
and affecting your work and judgment?

884
01:13:25,520 --> 01:13:27,919
说对了 米塔 的确影响了我的判断力
You're right, Mitat. It is affecting my judgment.

885
01:13:27,920 --> 01:13:30,319
因为我早就应该把你杀死了
'Cause you should have been dead a long time ago.

886
01:13:30,320 --> 01:13:34,599
等会儿 我妻子今天会工作到很晚 我四点半要来接女儿的
Hey, my wife works late. I need to pick up my girls at 4:30.

887
01:13:34,600 --> 01:13:37,087
我不能保证 但我尽量让你赶上
I can't promise, but I'll make an effort.

888
01:14:24,960 --> 01:14:26,161
开开窗户
Open up.

889
01:14:27,840 --> 01:14:29,769
你后视镜档我路了
I can't get around your mirror.

890
01:14:31,920 --> 01:14:33,929
随你便 混蛋
Fine, asshole.

891
01:15:41,640 --> 01:15:42,841
好酷!

892
01:15:47,200 --> 01:15:49,402
伊桑! 伊桑!

Yeah.

895
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:13,319
别打开! 那个锁有一个引爆器
Do not open! The lock has an explosive trigger.

896
01:16:13,320 --> 01:16:17,399
我知道公文箱的密码 吉多 告诉我引爆器的密码
I got the codes to the briefcase. Give me the codes to the trigger, Guido.

897
01:16:17,400 --> 01:16:20,399
但我告诉你之后 你就会杀了我
But after I give it to you, you will kill me.

898
01:16:20,400 --> 01:16:22,839
我不会 但是我保证 如果我数到三你还不告诉我
No, but I swear to God I'm gonna really torture you

899
01:16:22,840 --> 01:16:24,839
- 我会把你折磨得很惨  - 不要

- 佐伊?  - 伊桑 听着
- Zooey?  - Ethan, so listen,

904
01:16:35,880 --> 01:16:37,119
今天晚上...
I was thinking about tonight.

905
01:16:37,120 --> 01:16:41,041

909
01:16:52,400 --> 01:16:54,199
我想给他做正宗的意大利面酱
And I want to make him real spaghetti sauce

910
01:16:54,200 --> 01:16:56,039
但是我不知道除了西红柿还需要什么
but I don't know what I need besides tomatoes.

911
01:16:56,040 --> 01:16:57,720
我找不到妈妈 所以我需要你的帮助
I can't find Mom, so I need your help.

912
01:17:03,160 --> 01:17:04,691

930
01:17:58,120 --> 01:18:01,324
跟我女儿打个招呼吧
Why don't you say hello to my daughter.

931
01:18:02,520 --> 01:18:05,279
你好 我是吉多
Hello. I am Guido.

932
01:18:05,280 --> 01:18:06,919
嗨 吉多 就占用你一小会儿时间
Hi, Guido, this will only take a second.

933
01:18:06,920 --> 01:18:08,119
不 没关系!
No, no!

934
01:18:08,120 --> 01:18:11,159
- 想占多长就占多长  - 吉多是谁?
- Please take all the time you want.  - Who's Guido?

935
01:18:11,160 --> 01:18:13,639
不 不 不行
No, no, no.

936
01:18:13,640 --> 01:18:18,359
好吧 这是我妈妈最得意的浓酱菜谱
So, this is my mama's favorite reduction sauce.

937
01:18:18,360 --> 01:18:23,679
你需要西红柿 酸豆和大蒜
You will need tomatoes, capers and garlic.

938
01:18:23,680 --> 01:18:26,919
她总是用她花园里种的西红柿
She always uses tomatoes from her garden.

939
01:18:26,920 --> 01:18:29,199
你妈妈有个花园? 真酷
Your mom has a garden? That is so cool.

940
01:18:29,200 --> 01:18:33,399
嗯 她一生辛苦劳作来支持我的学业
Yes, she worked all her life so I could go to school,

941
01:18:33,400 --> 01:18:37,959
现在只剩下我一个人来照顾她了
and now I am the only one left to take care of her.

942
01:18:41,440 --> 01:18:42,926
吉多 还有什么?
What else, Guido?

943
01:18:44,360 --> 01:18:49,519
把橄榄油烧热 大蒜碾碎
Heat the olive oil, crush the garlic.

944
01:18:49,520 --> 01:18:52,199
然后把西红柿去皮
Then you peel the tomatoes.

945
01:18:52,200 --> 01:18:54,639
十分钟之后
After ten minutes, no more,

946
01:18:54,640 --> 01:18:57,959
加入酸豆和香菜
add capers and parsley.

947
01:18:57,960 --> 01:19:02,159
我妈妈的秘诀是加一杯红酒
And my mama's secret is a cup of red wine

948
01:19:02,160 --> 01:19:04,442
和一茶匙的糖
and a teaspoon of sugar.

949
01:19:05,800 --> 01:19:09,199
这个吉多真是妈妈的乖儿子啊
Boy, that Guido's a real mama's boy, huh?

950
01:19:09,200 --> 01:19:12,439
我觉得他好贴心 这么爱他妈妈 谢谢了 伊桑
I think it's sweet that he loves his mother. Thanks, Ethan.

951
01:19:12,440 --> 01:19:16,531
- 记得不要回家太早  - 好的
- Remember, don't get home too early.  - OK.

952
01:19:17,520 --> 01:19:19,919
不 等下!
No, wait!

953
01:19:19,920 --> 01:19:22,439
求你了 再打电话给她吧
Oh, please call her back.

954
01:19:22,440 --> 01:19:26,929
我还想告诉她我妈妈怎么做奶油煎饼卷呢
I wanted to give her my mama's favorite recipe for cannoli.

955
01:19:28,440 --> 01:19:30,005
你会看时间吗?
You know how to tell time?

956
01:19:31,400 --> 01:19:32,681
一点在哪儿?
Where's the one?

957
01:19:34,680 --> 01:19:35,961
三点呢?
Where's the three?

958
01:19:37,280 --> 01:19:39,199
这是两个小时
That's two hours.

959
01:19:39,200 --> 01:19:41,719
两个小时之后你把这人放了
You cut this guy loose in two hours.

960
01:19:41,720 --> 01:19:45,199
吉多 再告诉我一遍 这孩子把你放了之后你去哪里
Guido, remind me where you're going after this kid lets you go.

961
01:19:45,200 --> 01:19:48,404
我要回家跟妈妈住!
I'm going back home to live with Mama!

962
01:20:26,360 --> 01:20:28,289
你迟到了
You're late.

963
01:20:30,560 --> 01:20:32,569
我在给上培训课呢
I'm in the middle of a training session.

964
01:20:33,160 --> 01:20:37,001
嗯... 我看出来了
Yeah, I... I can see that.

965
01:20:46,320 --> 01:20:47,885
任务完成了
Job's done.

966
01:20:51,320 --> 01:20:53,559
- 你一点儿不懂情趣  - 还真不懂

967
01:20:53,560 --> 01:20:55,171
坐下
Sit down.

968
01:20:56,280 --> 01:20:58,130
还是你忘了你为什么来的?
Or did you forget why you came?

969
01:21:03,480 --> 01:21:06,490
- 香槟?  - 不用了
- Champagne?  - I don't think so.

970
01:21:07,400 --> 01:21:11,279
你就是一个在巴黎玩得很开心的美国女孩 是吧?
You're just an American girl having a good time in Paris, aren't you?

971
01:21:11,280 --> 01:21:13,479
谁能不爱巴黎?
Who doesn't love Paris?

972
01:21:13,480 --> 01:21:15,439
现在阿尔拜诺破产了
Now that we've bankrupted the Albino,

973
01:21:15,440 --> 01:21:18,559
他会夹着尾巴赶回巴黎
he'll come running back to Paris with his tail between his legs,

974
01:21:18,560 --> 01:21:21,599
我们就可以跟着他找到"狼王"了
leading us straight to the Wolf.

975
01:21:21,600 --> 01:21:23,370
什么时候?

你不能穿成这样去
You can't go dressed like that.

978
01:22:17,200 --> 01:22:19,799
我穿这样怎么了?
What's wrong with how I dress?

979
01:22:19,800 --> 01:22:22,731
亲爱的 你西服多大的? 42的?
What are you, cheri, 42 long?

980
01:22:24,080 --> 01:22:25,279

Yes.

981
01:22:25,280 --> 01:22:27,642
- 脱下来  - 什么?

982
01:22:29,520 --> 01:22:31,449
衣服 鞋 快脱光
Shoes, everything. Let's go.

983
01:22:53,680 --> 01:22:56,719
- 怎么回事?  - 宝宝
- What's going on?  - Baby.

984
01:22:56,720 --> 01:22:58,126
宝宝?
Baby?

985
01:23:01,040 --> 01:23:04,562
你把那个人放走了 没伤害他?
You let that guy go, right? You didn't hurt him?

986
01:23:06,240 --> 01:23:10,359
你拿着吧 是你的了
No, you keep that, that's yours now.

987
01:23:43,840 --> 01:23:45,639
天啊
My God.

988
01:23:45,640 --> 01:23:47,649
这肯定不是你一次经历这个吧
This is not the first time for you, after all.

989
01:23:49,320 --> 01:23:51,319
其实是的
Actually, it is.

990
01:23:51,320 --> 01:23:52,965
你女儿出生的时候呢?
What about your daughter?

991
01:23:55,200 --> 01:23:58,039
我没在
I wasn't there.

992
01:23:58,040 --> 01:24:03,531
我当时在出差 在非洲
I was working far away, in Africa to be precise.

993
01:24:06,320 --> 01:24:08,090
当时生意很好?
You were doing good?

994
01:24:10,600 --> 01:24:12,211
我都不记得了
I don't even remember.

995
01:24:16,720 --> 01:24:19,479
孩子要出生了!
The baby is coming!

996
01:24:26,400 --> 01:24:28,011
是个女孩
It is a girl.

997
01:24:38,800 --> 01:24:41,719
按照我们的习俗 在孩子第一次离开家之前
Before the baby leaves the house for the first time,

998
01:24:41,720 --> 01:24:46,403
家里人都要祝福她
it is our custom to have the family offer a blessing.

999
01:24:47,960 --> 01:24:50,839
- 离开?  - 对啊
- Leave?  - Yes.

1000
01:24:50,840 --> 01:24:55,559
- 我们要遵守和你的约定  - 约定?
- We are keeping our word to you.  - Word?

1001
01:24:55,560 --> 01:24:58,279
什么约定? 我给大家买了中餐
What word? I mean, I just I brought Chinese, OK?

1002
01:24:58,280 --> 01:25:00,479
我买了一百个签饼
I've got a 100 fortune cookies.

1003
01:25:00,480 --> 01:25:04,127
没关系 一切都是照计划走的
It's OK. Everything is as it should be.

1004
01:25:06,760 --> 01:25:09,879
我没有说孩子一出生 你们就要立刻离开
Look, I didn't mean for you to have to leave right after the child was born.

1005
01:25:09,880 --> 01:25:12,731
这公寓里有很多房间啊 大家都可以住在这儿
I mean, there's plenty of room for everyone.

1006
01:25:13,760 --> 01:25:15,759
可能就是因为房间太多了
Maybe it's too much room.

1007
01:25:15,760 --> 01:25:20,799
我妻子想在城外找一个小些的房子 没有客人
My wife wants a smaller place out of the city. No guests.

1008
01:25:20,800 --> 01:25:22,879
只有我们和孩子们
Just us and the children.

1009
01:25:22,880 --> 01:25:26,759
只要我们一家人在一起 一切都会变好的
It is good as long as we are together.

1010
01:25:26,760 --> 01:25:30,009
苏米亚想给孩子取名叫伊桑
Sumia wants to call the baby Ethan.

1011
01:25:37,640 --> 01:25:41,679
- 那是个男名  - 不
- It's a boy's name.  - No.

1012
01:25:41,680 --> 01:25:44,879
伊桑是一个放了我们一条生路的男人
It's the name of a great man who didn't shoot us when he could.

1013
01:25:44,880 --> 01:25:46,999
还让我们住在他的房子里

1014

她考虑地很仔细

1015
01:25:50,520 --> 01:25:52,370
这个名字很完美
The name is perfect.

1016
01:26:47,200 --> 01:26:49,759
嘿 今晚怎么样?
Hey, how did it go?

1017
01:26:49,760 --> 01:26:51,439
修邀请我去舞会了
Hugh asked me to go to the prom.

1018
01:26:51,440 --> 01:26:53,719
很好

1019
01:26:53,720 --> 01:26:55,888
所以晚餐很成功

1020
01:26:57,800 --> 01:27:01,607
哇 你穿得很帅嘛
Wow. You look nice.

1021
01:27:02,720 --> 01:27:04,160
是为了我穿的吗?
Did you wear that for me today?

1022
01:27:05,960 --> 01:27:08,559
呃... 不是 我...
Uh... no. I had to...

1023
01:27:08,560 --> 01:27:10,119
我做了个演讲
I had to give a speech.

1024
01:27:10,120 --> 01:27:12,279
你明天会去舞会前的派对吗?

1025
01:27:12,280 --> 01:27:15,159

1026
01:27:15,160 --> 01:27:17,359
在修爸爸家的屋顶上
It's on Hugh's father's rooftop.

1027
01:27:17,360 --> 01:27:20,279
你知道修来自一个很有教养的家庭
You know Hugh comes from a really cultured family.

1028
01:27:20,280 --> 01:27:21,322
嗯
Yeah.

1029
01:27:23,720 --> 01:27:27,481
别忘了你身体里流着匹兹堡钢人的血液
Don't forget you've got Steelers blood running through your veins.

1030
01:27:32,400 --> 01:27:36,844
修八岁的时候去了一个专门的学校学舞蹈
They sent Hugh to a special school to learn how to dance when he was like eight.

1031
01:27:37,280 --> 01:27:39,079
所以呢?
So?

1032
01:27:39,080 --> 01:27:41,759
所以他可能跳舞跳得很好
So that means he's probably a really good dancer.

1033
01:27:41,760 --> 01:27:43,519
所以呢?
So?

1034
01:27:43,520 --> 01:27:47,202
我不知道怎么像他那样跳舞 伊桑
So I don't know how to dance like that, Ethan.

1035
01:28:01,040 --> 01:28:03,279
- 不要  - 来吧
- No.  - Come on.

1036
01:28:03,280 --> 01:28:05,847
- 我不要跳舞  - 你可以站在我的脚上
- I'm not gonna dance.  - You can stand on my feet.

1037
01:28:07,320 --> 01:28:09,279
- 我年龄太大了  - 你不算大
- I'm too big for this.  - You're not too big.

1038
01:28:09,280 --> 01:28:11,767
来 站在我的脚上
Now, stand on my feet.

1039
01:28:12,960 --> 01:28:15,759
我来教你怎么伴着你妈妈最喜欢的曲子跳舞
I'm gonna teach you how to dance to your mother's favorite song.

1040
01:28:15,760 --> 01:28:17,559
好吧
OK.

1041
01:28:17,560 --> 01:28:20,525
往那边 再退后
There and back.

1042
01:28:22,080 --> 01:28:24,999
- 挺简单的?  - 不太难
- Pretty easy, huh?  - Not too bad.

1043
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:28,966
现在下去吧
Now get off.

1044
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:42,647
你明天能为了我穿这身西装吗?
Would you wear this suit tomorrow for me?

1045
01:28:44,080 --> 01:28:46,362
当然
Of course I would.

1046
01:29:08,200 --> 01:29:09,811
妈妈
Mom.

1047
01:29:16,160 --> 01:29:18,089
亲爱的
Sweetie.

1048
01:29:20,880 --> 01:29:24,719
我回来之后你还没有咳嗽过
You haven't coughed. Not since I've been back.

1049
01:29:24,720 --> 01:29:26,839
你现在什么感觉?
How are you feeling?

1050
01:29:26,840 --> 01:29:30,159
记得我当时带着佐伊去上一年级吗?
Remember when I'd bring Zooey to school in the first grade?

1051
01:29:30,160 --> 01:29:32,159
她拿着那只兔子娃娃
She had that stuffed rabbit.

1052
01:29:32,160 --> 01:29:33,646
那只叫"羊羊"的羊
Lamby the lamb.

1053
01:29:35,040 --> 01:29:37,447
对 羊羊
Right, Lamby the lamb.

1054
01:29:38,800 --> 01:29:41,399
我记得 有一天她再也不拿着娃娃去学校了
I remember the day she never took him to school again.

1055
01:29:41,400 --> 01:29:46,799
那天我胃很疼 我现在就是那种感觉
My stomach hurt that day. That's how I feel now.

1056
01:29:46,800 --> 01:29:49,799
- 那种感觉就像是失去了些什么  - 是啊
- Like you lost something.  - Yeah.

1057
01:29:49,800 --> 01:29:53,482
- 你告诉她了吗?  - 没有

1061
01:30:04,440 --> 01:30:08,079
她想要你亲口说出来
She needs to hear it from you.

1062
01:30:08,080 --> 01:30:12,365
我当然很爱她 就像...

1064
01:31:08,960 --> 01:31:10,279

01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:01,009
天啊
Oh, my God.

1205
01:50:04,040 --> 01:50:06,479
我在地狱吗?
Am I in hell?

1206
01:50:06,480 --> 01:50:09,639
我的裙底就那么可怕吗 伊桑
So that's what it looks like to you, Ethan.

1207
01:50:09,640 --> 01:50:13,003
早就猜到了
Figures.

1208
01:50:14,640 --> 01:50:17,605
- 干掉他  - 什么?
- Finish it. - What?

1209
01:50:20,080 --> 01:50:22,559
按我的话做
You'll do what I tell you to.

1210
01:50:22,560 --> 01:50:25,969
- 不  - 干掉他
- No.  - Finish it.

1211
01:50:26,680 --> 01:50:29,690
我已经完成我的任务配额了
I passed my quota, Vivi.

1212
01:50:30,680 --> 01:50:31,839
伊桑...
Ethan...

1213
01:50:31,840 --> 01:50:35,089
天啊!
Jesus Christ!

1214
01:50:42,840 --> 01:50:45,486
你真的不再为他们工作了吗?
Are you really done working for them?

1215
01:50:45,880 --> 01:50:48,679
一日杀手终生杀手 他不会改变的
A killer is a killer. He'll never change.

1216
01:50:48,680 --> 01:50:50,639
我知道我这样对你和佐伊不公平
I know I haven't done right by you and Zooey.

1217
01:50:50,640 --> 01:50:52,559
杀了他
Kill him.

1218
01:50:52,560 --> 01:50:54,119
很久之前我就该离开了
I should've left a long time ago.

1219
01:50:54,120 --> 01:50:56,399
- 你女儿出生的时候呢?  - 我没在
- What about your daughter?  - I wasn't there.

1220
01:50:56,400 --> 01:50:59,126
动手
Do it.

1221
01:51:01,120 --> 01:51:03,879
什么样的孩子连车都不会骑?
What kind of kid doesn't know how to ride a bike?

1222
01:51:03,880 --> 01:51:06,651
没爹教的孩子
The kind of kid who never had a father to teach her.

1223
01:51:08,760 --> 01:51:09,961
- 伊桑  - 伊桑!
- Ethan.  - Ethan!

1224

保证不再对我撒谎
Promise you'll never lie to me again.

1226
01:51:15,360 --> 01:51:16,641
你没有选择
You have no choice.

1227
01:51:19,520 --> 01:51:21,643
我不认为
I don't think so.

1228
01:51:24,320 --> 01:51:28,047
我妻子想要我金盆洗手了
The wife wants me to give it up.

1229
01:52:07,360 --> 01:52:08,759
我能和她说会话吗?
Can I talk to her?

1230
01:52:08,760 --> 01:52:11,719
不行 她现在在下面的沙滩上扔石子
No, she's down on the beach right now throwing rocks.

1231
01:52:11,720 --> 01:52:14,279
- 什么?  - 嗯 我们在
- What?  - Yeah, we're...

1232
01:52:14,280 --> 01:52:16,119
我们现在正处于调和期
We're taking a break from each other right now.

1233
01:52:16,120 --> 01:52:18,319
至少她不会拿石头扔我了
At least she's not throwing them at me.

1234
01:52:18,320 --> 01:52:20,559
一切还好吗?
Is everything all right?

1235
01:52:20,560 --> 01:52:24,839
都还好 我们的关系好好坏坏
Yeah, it's been all right. There's been good and bad days.

1236
01:52:24,840 --> 01:52:27,079
我们都说了心声
She said things, I've said things.

1237
01:52:27,080 --> 01:52:29,639
虽然有时会有泪水
There's been some tears,

1238
01:52:29,640 --> 01:52:31,922
但这个星期真的很不错
but the week overall's been really worth it.

1239
01:53:05,240 --> 01:53:06,441
嗨

1240
01:53:07,680 --> 01:53:10,079

These are some presents from me and, um...

1241
01:53:10,080 --> 01:53:12,399
送到家里的一个包裹
a package that was dropped at the house.

1242
01:53:12,400 --> 01:53:15,490
我听到你车子还发动着 你要回去了吗?
I can hear your car running. Are you gonna go back?

1243

我爱你 蒂娜
I love you, Tina.

1244
01:53:25,520 --> 01:53:27,529
你只是说说而已
Just not enough to quit.

1245
01:53:28,360 --> 01:53:31,962
我想你错了 但是我理解
I think you're wrong, but I understand.

1246
01:53:34,480 --> 01:53:40,159
如果我说一个字能够让你改变主意
If I could say one word to you to change your mind,

1247
01:53:40,160 --> 01:53:42,359
你会给我这个机会吗?
would you give me that chance?

1248
01:53:42,360 --> 01:53:44,005
我们不是在玩游戏
This isn't a game.

1249
01:53:45,160 --> 01:53:47,959
我不奢求和你住在一起 不奢求和你睡在一起
We don't have to stay in the same room, we don't have to sleep together,

1250
01:53:47,960 --> 01:53:50,119
我并不是想问这些
that's not what I'm asking.

1251
01:53:50,120 --> 01:53:53,799
如果这些事必须有个决断 决定权都在你
If that becomes important, you'll be the one to decide.

1252
01:53:53,800 --> 01:53:55,639
只要听到那个音乐 我就知道你们还需要我
I'll hear the music, and then I'll know.

1253
01:53:55,640 --> 01:53:57,490
如果再也听不到了...
And if I never hear it...

1254
01:53:58,920 --> 01:54:01,122
我得到的已经比我应得的要多了
I've already gotten more than I deserve.

1255
01:54:03,640 --> 01:54:08,926
我只是想和妻子女儿待在一起 越久越好
I just wanna hang out as long as I can with my daughter and my wife.

1256
01:54:10,840 --> 01:54:13,799
- 是什么词?  - 什么?
- What's the word?  - What?

1257
01:54:13,800 --> 01:54:15,479
你想用哪个字改变我的主意?
What's the one word to make me change my mind?

是 呃... 是"圣诞"
It's, uh... it's Christmas.

1259

1265
01:55:03,040 --> 01:55:04,651
爸爸是坏蛋吗?
Is Dad a badass?

1266
01:55:06,440 --> 01:55:10,486
嗯 他是... 他干的一些事挺混蛋的
Well, he's, um... He's done some things.

1267
01:55:15,840 --> 01:55:19,399
你觉得爸爸会留在这吗?
You think Dad's gonna stick around?

1268
01:55:19,400 --> 01:55:21,125
他会尽量待在这吧 亲爱的
As long as he can, sweetheart.

1269
