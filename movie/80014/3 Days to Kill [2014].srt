For the last ten years, the

- The wolf.

As you know, we have no positive
identification on what the wolf looks like.

7
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:08,016
What we do know is he's a
former German national

who sells atomic material to
terrorists all over the world.

No. I can explain the big

Hello. I am guido.

1043
01:18:05,280 --> 01:18:06,896
Hi, guido, this will
only take a second.

1044
01:18:06,920 --> 01:18:08,096
No, no!

1045
01:18:08,120 --> 01:18:11,136
- Please take all the time you want.
- <Font color="#808080">(Mumbles)</font> who's guido?

1046
01:18:11,160 --> 01:18:13,616
No, no, no.

1047
01:18:13,640 --> 01:18:18,336
So, this is my mama's
favorite reduction sauce.

1048
01:18:18,360 --> 01:18:23,656
You will need tomatoes,
capers and garlic.

1049
01:18:23,680 --> 01:18:26,896
She always uses tomatoes
from her garden.

1050
01:18:26,920 --> 01:18:29,176
Your mom has a garden?
That is so cool.

1051
01:18:29,200 --> 01:18:33,376
Yes, she worked all her life
so I could go to school,

1052
01:18:33,400 --> 01:18:37,936
and now I am the only one
left to take care of her.

1054
01:18:41,440 --> 01:18:42,926
What else, guido?

1055
01:18:44,360 --> 01:18:49,496
Heat the olive oil,
crush the garlic.

1056
01:18:49,520 --> 01:18:52,176
Then you peel the tomatoes.

1057
01:18:52,200 --> 01:18:54,616
After ten minutes, no more,

1058
01:18:54,640 --> 01:18:57,936
add capers and parsley.

1059
01:18:57,960 --> 01:19:02,136
And my mama's secret
is a cup of red wine

1060
01:19:02,160 --> 01:19:04,442
and a teaspoon of sugar.

1061
01:19:05,800 --> 01:19:09,176
Boy, that guido's a
real mama's boy, huh?

1062
01:19:09,200 --> 01:19:12,416
I think it's sweet that he loves
his mother. Thanks, Ethan.

1063
01:19:12,440 --> 01:19:16,531
- Remember, don't get home too early.
- Ok.

1064
01:19:17,520 --> 01:19:19,896
No, wait!

1065
01:19:19,920 --> 01:19:22,416
Oh, please call her back.

1066
01:19:22,440 --> 01:19:26,929
I wanted to give her my mama's
favorite recipe for cannoli.

1067
01:19:28,440 --> 01:19:30,005
You know how to tell time?

1068
01:19:31,400 --> 01:19:32,681
Where's the one?

1069
01:19:34,680 --> 01:19:35,961
Where's the three?

1070
01:19:37,280 --> 01:19:39,176
That's two hours.

1071
01:19:39,200 --> 01:19:41,696
You cut this guy
loose in two hours.

1072
01:19:41,720 --> 01:19:45,176
Guido, remind me where you're
going after this kid lets you go.

Yeah, I... I can see that.

01:20:46,320 --> 01:20:47,885
Job's done.

1079
01:20:51,320 --> 01:20:53,536
- You're no fun.
- Not really.

1080
01:20:53,560 --> 01:20:55,171
Sit down.

1081
01:20:56,280 --> 01:20:58,130
Or did you forget why you came?

1082
01:21:03,480 --> 01:21:06,490
- Champagne?
- I don't think so.

1083
01:21:07,400 --> 01:21:11,256
You're just an American girl having
a good time in Paris, aren't you?

1084
01:21:11,280 --> 01:21:13,456
Who doesn't love Paris?

1085
01:21:13,480 --> 01:21:15,416
Now that we've
bankrupted the albino,

1086
01:21:15,440 --> 01:21:18,536

When?

1089
01:21:24,560 --> 01:21:26,205
Very soon.

1090
01:22:10,440 --> 01:22:12,165
You can't go dressed like that.

1091

- Take it off.
- Excuse me?

You let that guy go, right?
You didn't hurt him?

I mean, there's plenty
of room for everyone.

- It's a boy's name.
- No.

1129
01:25:41,680 --> 01:25:44,856
It's the name of a great man who
didn't shoot us when he could.

1130
01:25:44,880 --> 01:25:46,976
And instead gave us his home.

1131
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:49,089
She has chosen carefully.

1132
01:25:50,520 --> 01:25:52,370
The name is perfect.

Uh... no. I had to...

1140
01:27:08,560 --> 01:27:10,096
I had to give a speech.

Are you coming to the

Yeah.

how to dance when he was like eight.

1148
01:27:37,280 --> 01:27:39,056
So?

1149
01:27:39,080 --> 01:27:41,736
So that means he's probably
a really good dancer.

1150

So?

1151

dance like that, Ethan.

Don't.

I wouldn't mind killing you.

You scared a lot of
people up there.

You'll do what I tell you to.

If I could say one word to
you to change your mind,

would you give me that chance?

If that becomes important,
you'll be the one to decide.

I'll hear the music,
and then I'll know.
