1
00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:28.238
<i>I...</i>

2
00:00:28.695 --> 00:00:31.605
<i>am the jungle's eyes.</i>

3
00:00:32.574 --> 00:00:34.834
<i>I can see the past...</i>

4
00:00:35.243 --> 00:00:37.830
<i>and the future.</i>

5
00:00:39.289 --> 00:00:41.789
<i>It is I, Kaa,</i>

6
00:00:42.125 --> 00:00:45.495
<i>who witnessed the coming of man...</i>

7
00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.546
<i>...and the jungle...</i>

8
00:00:50.633 --> 00:00:53.473
<i>trying to survive.</i>

9
00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:02.811
<i>I saw chaos</i>

10
00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:06.779
<i>and darkness come to our lands.</i>

11
00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:19.159
Ah!

12
00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.850
<i>I saw the tiger, Shere Khan,</i>

13
00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.680
<i>killing man,</i>

14
00:01:39.933 --> 00:01:44.403
<i>and breaking the jungle's ancient law.</i>

15
00:02:07.127 --> 00:02:08.287
<i>And then,</i>

16
00:02:08.878 --> 00:02:10.708
<i>one fateful night,</i>

17
00:02:11.297 --> 00:02:14.627
<i>I saw the jungle place its hopes</i>

18
00:02:14.717 --> 00:02:16.870
<i>into the hands...</i>

19
00:02:16.678 --> 00:02:19.218
<i>of a small creature,</i>

20
00:02:19.806 --> 00:02:21.636
<i>the like of which...</i>

21
00:02:22.142 --> 00:02:25.232
<i>it had never seen before.</i>

22
00:02:52.213 --> 00:02:53.763
Hmm?

23
00:04:35.483 --> 00:04:36.903
How did it get here?

24
00:04:37.652 --> 00:04:38.702
I don't know.

25
00:04:40.989 --> 00:04:41.989
Is it hurt?

26
00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:50.289
There's no wound.

27
00:04:52.208 --> 00:04:53.248
It's on its own.

28
00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:56.212
I've never seen a man-cub before.

29
00:04:56.296 --> 00:04:57.296
It's so...

30
00:04:58.923 --> 00:04:59.973
small.

31
00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:02.470
It doesn't fear us.

32
00:05:05.346 --> 00:05:07.960
What are we going to do with it?

33
00:05:11.311 --> 00:05:12.691
Evening, Nisha.

34
00:05:12.812 --> 00:05:13.812
Vihaan.

35
00:05:14.856 --> 00:05:18.186
- It's a lovely night, isn't it?
- What is it that you want, Tabaqui?

36
00:05:18.276 --> 00:05:20.356
What's that I smell?
Fresh kill?

37
00:05:20.445 --> 00:05:22.315
If it's bones you're after,
look elsewhere.

38
00:05:23.156 --> 00:05:24.986
We have enough mouths to feed.

39
00:05:27.327 --> 00:05:30.157
I meant no harm, Nisha.

40
00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:36.384
Oh!

41
00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:40.338
Your master calls.

42
00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:42.500
You best go quickly.

43
00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:44.839
He sounds an ill temper tonight.

44
00:05:44.927 --> 00:05:46.597
That he does. That he does.

45
00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:50.480
And with good reason.

46
00:05:53.436 --> 00:05:56.396
I found the man-cub!
I found the man-cub!

47
00:05:56.481 --> 00:05:57.771
Finish cleaning him off.

48
00:05:57.857 --> 00:05:59.107
- Nisha.
- Clean him!

49
00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:00.990
- Where you going?
- To Akela.

50
00:06:01.903 --> 00:06:04.113
A council must be held
if we are to keep him.

51
00:06:04.197 --> 00:06:06.677
- Keep him?
- Don't let him out of your sight.

52
00:06:06.741 --> 00:06:09.121
We can't keep him!

53
00:06:19.295 --> 00:06:23.255
Nisha, you have called council.
What's the matter at hand?

54
00:06:24.133 --> 00:06:25.303
We've found... a man-cub.

55
00:06:33.351 --> 00:06:37.231
- That's not a wolf.
- That doesn't belong here. A man-cub! Outrageous.

56
00:06:39.107 --> 00:06:40.170
Well,

57
00:06:40.108 --> 00:06:41.728
this is most unusual indeed.

58
00:06:42.902 --> 00:06:43.902
Nisha,

59
00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:46.490
you wish to raise this cub
as if he were your own?

60
00:06:47.281 --> 00:06:48.531
I do.

61
00:06:49.158 --> 00:06:50.158
And Vihaan? You, too?

62
00:06:53.204 --> 00:06:54.440
I do.

63
00:06:54.122 --> 00:06:55.292
It's a man-cub!

64
00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:56.540
You know the law.

65
00:06:58.459 --> 00:07:00.169
This cub was not born among us.

66
00:07:01.587 --> 00:07:04.297
So, who,<i> here,</i> speaks for the cub?

67
00:07:05.675 --> 00:07:07.465
I speak for the cub.

68
00:07:09.387 --> 00:07:12.347
The law states that the life of a cub...

69
00:07:12.849 --> 00:07:14.190
may be bought...

70
00:07:14.475 --> 00:07:15.475
for a price.

71
00:07:17.103 --> 00:07:18.193
I brought my payment.

72
00:07:18.771 --> 00:07:19.771
We have one.

73
00:07:21.274 --> 00:07:23.114
Who else will speak for the cub?

74
00:07:24.277 --> 00:07:25.277
Baloo does.

75
00:07:25.528 --> 00:07:26.818
Baloo?

76
00:07:27.196 --> 00:07:30.260
- Bagheera...
- He's not a wolf. He has no say.

77
00:07:30.116 --> 00:07:32.756
He's the teacher of your cubs.
That makes him a member of the pack.

78
00:07:33.661 --> 00:07:36.541
I ain't speakin' for no...

79
00:07:36.873 --> 00:07:37.963
...a man-cub.

80
00:07:38.916 --> 00:07:42.586
Bagheera, have you lost your mind?
A man-cub living in the jungle?

81
00:07:58.603 --> 00:07:59.603
Akela,

82
00:07:59.687 --> 00:08:01.437
his parents will come.

83
00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:07.284
His parents are dead.

84
00:08:08.196 --> 00:08:10.260
I killed them.

85
00:08:11.532 --> 00:08:15.412
There is no one to come looking for him.

86
00:08:17.538 --> 00:08:19.748
This is not your concern, Shere Khan.

87
00:08:19.832 --> 00:08:21.382
The cub is mine.

88
00:08:21.459 --> 00:08:24.209
I already tasted its mother's blood.

89
00:08:25.505 --> 00:08:27.795
It is my right.

90
00:08:27.882 --> 00:08:29.972
Your right according to who's law?

91
00:08:30.510 --> 00:08:31.261
Best you leave now.

92
00:08:31.344 --> 00:08:34.974
Careful, Akela.

93
00:08:35.431 --> 00:08:38.181
You do not want to challenge me.

94
00:08:40.610 --> 00:08:41.610
This cub...

95
00:08:42.104 --> 00:08:44.234
is under the protection of the pack.

96
00:08:44.607 --> 00:08:47.187
Should you decide to take me,

97
00:08:47.818 --> 00:08:50.680
you take on the pack.

98
00:08:51.239 --> 00:08:52.239
All of us.

99
00:08:56.410 --> 00:08:57.580
As long as I am leader,

100
00:08:58.287 --> 00:09:00.917
this part of the jungle is closed to you.

101
00:09:04.335 --> 00:09:07.955
You cannot be leader forever.

102
00:09:08.548 --> 00:09:10.718
The day you miss your kill,

103
00:09:11.634 --> 00:09:14.514
the man-cub's blood...

104
00:09:14.845 --> 00:09:18.805
will run down my chin.

105
00:09:30.653 --> 00:09:32.363
The cub is spoken for.

106
00:09:32.738 --> 00:09:34.680
He is one of us.

107
00:09:34.574 --> 00:09:36.664
You will teach him as you would your own.

108
00:09:37.577 --> 00:09:38.907
As long as I am alive,

109
00:09:39.662 --> 00:09:41.712
the pack will stand by the man-cub.

110
00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:30.300
Whoa!

111
00:10:51.442 --> 00:10:54.862
Hunting is sacred, little brother.

112
00:10:55.780 --> 00:10:57.740
It is our right.

113
00:10:59.408 --> 00:11:02.908
But we never do it for sport.

114
00:11:03.788 --> 00:11:06.498
Shh...

115
00:11:19.970 --> 00:11:22.430
Wait. Wait.

116
00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:26.440
We look them in the eye...

117
00:11:27.603 --> 00:11:28.943
so that the soul...

118
00:11:29.355 --> 00:11:31.265
doesn't depart, alone.

119
00:12:07.810 --> 00:12:08.980
Bagheera...

120
00:12:19.864 --> 00:12:21.744
How old is the jungle, Bagheera?

121
00:12:22.491 --> 00:12:25.411
The jungle has been here
since before you were born

122
00:12:25.494 --> 00:12:27.294
and it will be here...

123
00:12:30.499 --> 00:12:31.999
...after you die.

124
00:12:32.251 --> 00:12:34.841
The jungle is eternal.

125
00:12:35.629 --> 00:12:36.799
Bagheera...

126
00:12:38.507 --> 00:12:42.427
why am I different to the other wolves?

127
00:12:50.478 --> 00:12:51.768
You are no different,

128
00:12:52.605 --> 00:12:53.645
little brother.

129
00:12:55.316 --> 00:12:57.436
You are special.

130
00:12:58.402 --> 00:13:00.862
<i>Of course you're different.</i>

131
00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:03.280
That's why you need special training.

132
00:13:04.330 --> 00:13:05.623
You know what your trouble is?

133
00:13:06.452 --> 00:13:07.452
Lack of focus.

134
00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:09.120
Baloo,

135
00:13:09.413 --> 00:13:11.463
how many ants can you fit in your mouth?

136
00:13:11.957 --> 00:13:13.377
Ants are really small

137
00:13:13.834 --> 00:13:15.844
and your mouth is really big.

138
00:13:16.504 --> 00:13:19.424
- I bet...
- Mowgli, will you concentrate?

139
00:13:26.430 --> 00:13:27.430
Do... not...

140
00:13:30.476 --> 00:13:31.476
move.

141
00:13:37.483 --> 00:13:38.863
Why do I have to do this?

142
00:13:38.943 --> 00:13:39.943
'Cause I said so.

143
00:13:39.985 --> 00:13:41.695
Tell me the three laws, now.

144
00:13:41.779 --> 00:13:43.569
"No wolf shall have contact with man."

145
00:13:43.656 --> 00:13:45.116
- Next.
- Baloo...

146
00:13:46.158 --> 00:13:48.328
- what happened to your tail?
- Next!

147
00:13:48.577 --> 00:13:50.657
"No wolf shall hunt man's animals.

148
00:13:51.288 --> 00:13:53.998
Above all, the cow, which is sacred!"

149
00:13:54.416 --> 00:13:57.546
Did it fall off?
Is that why you don't have one?

150
00:13:57.628 --> 00:13:59.548
What? Why haven't you got a tail?

151
00:13:59.630 --> 00:14:02.260
I don't know.
I never really thought about it.

152
00:14:02.341 --> 00:14:03.511
Third law.

153
00:14:03.801 --> 00:14:04.641
Now!

154
00:14:04.718 --> 00:14:08.258
"No wolf shall kill man in the jungle,
for killing man only brings danger."

155
00:14:08.347 --> 00:14:10.347
Oh, well. Least you know your laws.

156
00:14:10.432 --> 00:14:13.522
Now, we just got to get you
to run as fast as the other wolves.

157
00:14:15.104 --> 00:14:18.364
Oy!

158
00:14:18.566 --> 00:14:21.486
Don't let your guard down.

159
00:14:22.111 --> 00:14:24.201
All right,
that's enough for today, Mowgli.

160
00:14:25.406 --> 00:14:29.196
Straight back to the caves.
No wandering. Run like a wolf, d'you hear?

161
00:14:29.660 --> 00:14:32.120
I can't hear you!

162
00:15:11.952 --> 00:15:13.200
Mowgli!

163
00:15:13.829 --> 00:15:14.909
Hey, Mowgli.

164
00:15:15.706 --> 00:15:17.626
- Bhoot!
- What are you doing?

165
00:15:17.833 --> 00:15:20.930
- Nothing.
- Hey, do you want to play?

166
00:15:21.629 --> 00:15:23.709
- Got ya!
- - - Oh!

167
00:15:26.133 --> 00:15:28.530
Oh, I nearly had you.

168
00:15:29.845 --> 00:15:30.965
You're good at hiding.

169
00:15:31.550 --> 00:15:34.765
Mum taught me how to hide.
She shows me loads of tricks.

170
00:15:34.850 --> 00:15:37.770
So I can protect myself.

171
00:15:37.853 --> 00:15:40.523
She says, "Others can mistake...

172
00:15:40.731 --> 00:15:42.821
individuality for weakness."

173
00:15:43.192 --> 00:15:45.492
That's why they have a go at me sometimes.

174
00:15:47.112 --> 00:15:48.112
Yeah.

175
00:15:48.697 --> 00:15:49.697
Me, too.

176
00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:51.992
Come on. I'll race you home.

177
00:15:53.410 --> 00:15:55.120
On my call...

178
00:15:56.163 --> 00:15:57.163
Go!

179
00:16:11.303 --> 00:16:12.303
Hey.

180
00:16:13.681 --> 00:16:14.681
Hey, brother.

181
00:16:15.891 --> 00:16:17.641
What did Baloo make you do today?

182
00:16:17.726 --> 00:16:19.806
Put a scorpion on me
and told me not to move.

183
00:16:19.895 --> 00:16:21.935
He says I lack focus.

184
00:16:22.220 --> 00:16:24.152
Aw, Baloo says that to all of us.

185
00:16:25.670 --> 00:16:26.817
- How was your lesson?
- Fine.

186
00:16:26.986 --> 00:16:28.706
Your brother tells me
you're getting faster.

187
00:16:28.779 --> 00:16:30.699
He can nearly keep pace with me.

188
00:16:30.781 --> 00:16:32.241
He can almost beat Bhoot.

189
00:16:32.324 --> 00:16:35.204
Yeah, he should just race
with his freak friend!

190
00:16:35.285 --> 00:16:37.745
It's only natural they spend
so much time with each other.

191
00:16:37.830 --> 00:16:39.370
Freaks have to stick together.

192
00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:44.200
That's enough.

193
00:16:44.795 --> 00:16:45.795
Ow. That really hurt.

194
00:16:45.879 --> 00:16:46.879
Inside, now.

195
00:16:47.965 --> 00:16:48.965
Thanks.

196
00:16:49.341 --> 00:16:51.641
You shouldn't let them pick on you
like that.

197
00:16:52.386 --> 00:16:53.796
We were only playing.

198
00:16:54.130 --> 00:16:55.143
Better go home, Bhoot.

199
00:16:55.806 --> 00:16:57.176
Bye, Mowgli! Ow.

200
00:16:57.266 --> 00:17:00.160
I meant what I said to Mum.
You are getting faster.

201
00:17:00.102 --> 00:17:01.902
Your father was never
much of a runner either.

202
00:17:02.229 --> 00:17:04.769
It's true. I was the slowest in my group.

203
00:17:04.857 --> 00:17:07.897
I never thought I was gonna complete
The Running. I was sure I would fail.

204
00:17:08.610 --> 00:17:11.610
- You're going to be late.
- Have a good hunt, Father.

205
00:17:11.697 --> 00:17:15.270
Before you know it, you'll be coming along
with me. All of you!

206
00:17:16.869 --> 00:17:19.659
- Good hunting!
- Good hunting all!

207
00:17:30.900 --> 00:17:31.590
This is the jungle!

208
00:17:32.801 --> 00:17:35.261
In the jungle, we all hunt.

209
00:17:35.345 --> 00:17:36.675
And...

210
00:17:36.764 --> 00:17:39.394
...we are all hunted.

211
00:17:39.683 --> 00:17:41.230
You see what that means.

212
00:17:41.810 --> 00:17:43.230
It means that you...

213
00:17:43.771 --> 00:17:45.311
you don't want to get caught.

214
00:17:47.733 --> 00:17:50.693
That's why you can't join the pack...

215
00:17:51.278 --> 00:17:54.528
until you have passed The Running...
Pay attention!

216
00:18:01.163 --> 00:18:02.623
"What's The Running, Baloo?"

217
00:18:03.874 --> 00:18:06.924
The running is the hunt where you...

218
00:18:07.628 --> 00:18:09.208
are the prey.

219
00:18:11.924 --> 00:18:13.540
Now, Bagheera here...

220
00:18:13.133 --> 00:18:14.933
You all know Bagheera, don't you?

221
00:18:15.100 --> 00:18:16.720
Yeah, Bagheera, friendly Bagheera.

222
00:18:17.179 --> 00:18:20.429
In The Running, Bagheera will hunt you,

223
00:18:20.516 --> 00:18:21.926
and if he catches you...

224
00:18:22.643 --> 00:18:23.733
you fail.

225
00:18:24.603 --> 00:18:27.300
What happens if you fail?
You don't join the pack!

226
00:18:33.987 --> 00:18:36.367
But I've never had one of my cubs fail.

227
00:18:39.340 --> 00:18:42.204
And I'm not gonna start now.

228
00:18:44.998 --> 00:18:45.998
Good.

229
00:18:46.458 --> 00:18:47.708
Let's practice, shall we?

230
00:18:52.673 --> 00:18:53.673
On my call.

231
00:18:54.383 --> 00:18:57.473
Wait... wait...

232
00:18:59.263 --> 00:19:00.263
Go!

233
00:19:01.557 --> 00:19:02.807
Come on, now!

234
00:19:04.893 --> 00:19:06.230
Pick up the pace!

235
00:19:09.857 --> 00:19:11.277
Come on!

236
00:19:13.485 --> 00:19:14.485
Faster!

237
00:20:13.754 --> 00:20:15.714
You were with the monkey-people...

238
00:20:16.890 --> 00:20:19.900
again.

239
00:20:20.302 --> 00:20:22.552
The monkey-people have no law,

240
00:20:23.347 --> 00:20:24.597
they're unpredictable,

241
00:20:24.681 --> 00:20:26.481
and they can't even speak proper.

242
00:20:26.892 --> 00:20:30.562
- I think they're funny.
- There's nothing funny about them.

243
00:20:30.646 --> 00:20:32.306
You keep away, do you understand?

244
00:20:32.397 --> 00:20:36.187
- I'm not afraid of them.
- Only fools feel no fear, Mowgli.

245
00:20:36.610 --> 00:20:39.300
The monkey-people are especially foolish.

246
00:20:39.279 --> 00:20:40.989
There's nothing they're afraid of.

247
00:20:41.615 --> 00:20:44.275
Well, except Kaa.

248
00:20:44.618 --> 00:20:46.698
Oh, they can't even lay eyes on her.

249
00:20:46.787 --> 00:20:47.787
Who's Kaa?

250
00:20:47.871 --> 00:20:50.871
Oh, you don't want to meet Kaa.

251
00:20:51.830 --> 00:20:53.133
Kaa the Python...

252
00:20:53.210 --> 00:20:55.250
is as old as the jungle.

253
00:20:56.797 --> 00:20:58.757
She sees the past...

254
00:20:59.424 --> 00:21:00.764
and the future.

255
00:21:03.303 --> 00:21:05.853
Turn around!

256
00:21:09.977 --> 00:21:10.977
Eyes forward.

257
00:21:17.776 --> 00:21:18.776
The cow...

258
00:21:18.944 --> 00:21:21.284
had been killed
and left there to be found.

259
00:21:21.738 --> 00:21:27.578
- The tiger! He's come back!
- Only Khan would kill man's cattle.

260
00:21:27.661 --> 00:21:30.501
- One man-cub will bring more men!
- It's Shere Khan!

261
00:21:30.580 --> 00:21:32.920
Akela, we knew this would happen!
We told you!

262
00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:36.340
Can't you see, Akela,
the man-cub is putting us all in danger.

263
00:21:36.420 --> 00:21:40.590
- You were wrong to ever take him in!
- We should give him to the tiger!

264
00:21:40.674 --> 00:21:42.594
- Akela, no!
- Save the pack!

265
00:21:43.510 --> 00:21:44.510
Please.

266
00:21:45.804 --> 00:21:47.640
He is one of us.

267
00:21:50.309 --> 00:21:51.769
I will see to this matter.

268
00:21:52.561 --> 00:21:53.561
Go!

269
00:22:05.730 --> 00:22:07.583
Shere Khan wants to bring war
to the jungle.

270
00:22:08.702 --> 00:22:09.702
War?

271
00:22:10.662 --> 00:22:12.962
With man? Is he out of his mind?

272
00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:14.400
War with me.

273
00:22:15.959 --> 00:22:17.289
He knows I'm getting old.

274
00:22:17.919 --> 00:22:20.339
This is his way of bringing chaos
to the pack.

275
00:22:21.214 --> 00:22:24.140
- Khan wants the boy.
- We can protect him.

276
00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:26.972
You know there is only one way
to protect him.

277
00:22:27.512 --> 00:22:29.432
He must go to the man village.

278
00:22:30.570 --> 00:22:31.477
You're forgetting, Bagheera,

279
00:22:32.170 --> 00:22:34.727
this was always more
than just a good deed.

280
00:22:35.479 --> 00:22:36.939
The jungle is changing.

281
00:22:38.230 --> 00:22:41.443
Man is taking more of it,
as each season passes.

282
00:22:42.736 --> 00:22:43.736
And the boy...

283
00:22:44.446 --> 00:22:47.696
may just be our only hope of survival.

284
00:22:48.492 --> 00:22:50.872
The jungle is no longer safe for him.

285
00:22:51.828 --> 00:22:55.168
- The pack won't accept him.
- They will if he passes The Running.

286
00:22:55.874 --> 00:22:57.134
Baloo, is he ready?

287
00:22:57.209 --> 00:22:59.629
Of course he's not ready.
He's not a wolf.

288
00:22:59.711 --> 00:23:01.100
Then make him ready.

289
00:23:06.968 --> 00:23:08.800
Right,

290
00:23:08.950 --> 00:23:09.385
no more messing about.

291
00:23:10.305 --> 00:23:11.965
Can you run as fast as a wolf?

292
00:23:12.641 --> 00:23:13.731
No, you can't.

293
00:23:14.518 --> 00:23:17.518
You've got hands with fingers on the ends,

294
00:23:17.604 --> 00:23:18.614
so let's use them.

295
00:23:18.688 --> 00:23:19.688
What?

296
00:23:20.315 --> 00:23:22.395
Now jump, to there.

297
00:23:23.318 --> 00:23:24.438
Come on, hurry up.

298
00:23:32.536 --> 00:23:33.536
Again.

299
00:23:35.580 --> 00:23:36.920
Oh, nearly!

300
00:23:42.921 --> 00:23:45.421
Ah!

301
00:23:45.507 --> 00:23:46.797
- Yes!
- Baloo!

302
00:25:12.930 --> 00:25:13.473
Ah!

303
00:25:26.399 --> 00:25:27.399
Ah!

304
00:26:58.116 --> 00:26:59.116
What happened?

305
00:27:24.768 --> 00:27:26.980
Come on, little brother.

306
00:27:26.645 --> 00:27:27.645
Time to go home.

307
00:27:51.860 --> 00:27:53.126
Do you know why those men have come?

308
00:27:56.424 --> 00:27:59.764
They've come to hunt the tiger
that steals their cattle.

309
00:28:00.136 --> 00:28:01.216
Will they kill him?

310
00:28:01.304 --> 00:28:02.304
It won't be easy.

311
00:28:03.682 --> 00:28:05.220
Shere Khan...

312
00:28:05.517 --> 00:28:06.517
is clever.

313
00:28:08.610 --> 00:28:09.191
Very dangerous.

314
00:28:12.774 --> 00:28:13.774
Mowgli...

315
00:28:15.318 --> 00:28:17.198
the jungle is no longer safe for you.

316
00:28:19.114 --> 00:28:23.840
But if you were to be in a place
where Shere Khan would never go,

317
00:28:23.827 --> 00:28:25.197
then you would be safe.

318
00:28:26.329 --> 00:28:27.959
Where does Shere Khan never go?

319
00:28:29.124 --> 00:28:30.254
Mmm...

320
00:28:30.417 --> 00:28:32.667
you know... the man village.

321
00:28:33.169 --> 00:28:34.499
Why would I go there?

322
00:28:39.676 --> 00:28:41.586
Because you are a man-cub.

323
00:28:44.764 --> 00:28:47.240
I have seen the way
you look at the village.

324
00:28:48.810 --> 00:28:50.560
You are one of them.

325
00:28:52.210 --> 00:28:53.111
I'm a wolf.

326
00:28:53.189 --> 00:28:54.229
Mowgli...

327
00:28:59.404 --> 00:29:01.744
He wants your blood, little brother.

328
00:29:01.990 --> 00:29:04.910
It was Shere Khan
who killed your man-parents

329
00:29:04.993 --> 00:29:06.663
all those seasons ago,

330
00:29:07.287 --> 00:29:09.707
and now he wants to kill you.

331
00:29:11.416 --> 00:29:12.666
The pack will protect me.

332
00:29:12.751 --> 00:29:14.291
If you fail The Running...

333
00:29:14.377 --> 00:29:15.247
I won't fail.

334
00:29:15.336 --> 00:29:16.336
You won't...

335
00:29:17.213 --> 00:29:18.673
be able to join the pack.

336
00:29:19.480 --> 00:29:20.628
I won't fail!

337
00:29:22.385 --> 00:29:23.755
Then promise me this.

338
00:29:25.472 --> 00:29:26.722
If you do fail...

339
00:29:28.160 --> 00:29:29.426
you will go to the village.

340
00:29:30.935 --> 00:29:32.185
Promise me, Mowgli.

341
00:29:57.545 --> 00:29:59.755
Good evening!

342
00:30:23.290 --> 00:30:25.409
Don't worry.
I'll kill your tiger.

343
00:30:25.573 --> 00:30:27.123
How many's he taken this time?

344
00:30:28.201 --> 00:30:29.201
Careful!

345
00:30:29.536 --> 00:30:30.746
Quickly, now. Come on.

346
00:31:10.702 --> 00:31:12.872
Did you smell the blood, man-cub?

347
00:31:14.163 --> 00:31:15.293
What is it?

348
00:31:19.168 --> 00:31:23.880
- The creature that did that to your tail.
- It's called "fire."

349
00:31:24.700 --> 00:31:25.627
It's hotter than the sun.

350
00:31:26.968 --> 00:31:28.758
And it's quicker than the panther.

351
00:31:30.722 --> 00:31:33.222
Your kind use dark magic, man-cub.

352
00:31:33.308 --> 00:31:34.848
They're not my kind.

353
00:31:41.524 --> 00:31:42.524
Sometimes...

354
00:31:43.484 --> 00:31:46.284
I dream I'm a tiger.

355
00:31:47.113 --> 00:31:49.163
But I always wake up a hyena.

356
00:31:53.953 --> 00:31:56.583
Ow.

357
00:31:58.917 --> 00:31:59.917
Ooh.

358
00:32:12.388 --> 00:32:14.388
You should try and get some sleep.

359
00:32:19.729 --> 00:32:21.649
You'll want to be rested for tomorrow.

360
00:32:31.491 --> 00:32:32.991
What's bothering you, my love?

361
00:32:34.827 --> 00:32:36.537
All I've ever wanted...

362
00:32:38.957 --> 00:32:40.377
my whole life...

363
00:32:42.377 --> 00:32:43.707
is to be a wolf.

364
00:32:47.882 --> 00:32:50.182
For the others to see me as an...

365
00:32:52.345 --> 00:32:53.345
equal.

366
00:32:56.474 --> 00:32:58.944
This is my chance to prove myself.

367
00:33:00.269 --> 00:33:02.109
To prove that I'm one of them.

368
00:33:04.230 --> 00:33:05.403
To prove that I belong.

369
00:33:05.483 --> 00:33:06.483
You belong.

370
00:33:10.363 --> 00:33:11.863
You belong, Mowgli.

371
00:33:14.492 --> 00:33:17.792
Don't, ever, let anyone
make you think otherwise.

372
00:33:21.207 --> 00:33:23.667
You will always be my son, Mowgli.

373
00:33:26.212 --> 00:33:28.132
Nothing can ever change that.

374
00:33:59.203 --> 00:34:01.830
You are about to take part

375
00:34:01.289 --> 00:34:03.249
in one of our oldest traditions.

376
00:34:04.792 --> 00:34:06.502
The Running of the Pack.

377
00:34:07.628 --> 00:34:09.458
Those of you who pass the test...

378
00:34:10.965 --> 00:34:12.335
will have earned the right...

379
00:34:13.301 --> 00:34:14.301
to join us...

380
00:34:14.844 --> 00:34:15.934
in the night hunt.

381
00:34:19.307 --> 00:34:20.677
As is customary...

382
00:34:22.600 --> 00:34:24.600
Bagheera will perform his task as chaser.

383
00:34:27.940 --> 00:34:29.300
Mowgli!

384
00:34:29.609 --> 00:34:30.989
Good luck, Mowgli!

385
00:34:41.204 --> 00:34:42.334
Face the hill.

386
00:34:48.711 --> 00:34:49.801
Good luck, brother.

387
00:34:49.879 --> 00:34:54.179
I must warn you.
Bagheera has been told not to hold back.

388
00:34:59.972 --> 00:35:00.972
On my call.

389
00:35:06.938 --> 00:35:07.978
Go!

390
00:35:19.826 --> 00:35:20.826
Bagheera.

391
00:35:21.619 --> 00:35:22.619
If you will.

392
00:36:06.247 --> 00:36:07.957
Out of my way, freak!

393
00:36:42.241 --> 00:36:44.911
Ah!

394
00:38:04.991 --> 00:38:06.411
Let him go, Bagheera.

395
00:38:08.577 --> 00:38:09.577
Bagheera...

396
00:38:32.476 --> 00:38:33.476
Get up.

397
00:38:54.749 --> 00:38:56.709
You let your guard down.

398
00:38:58.419 --> 00:39:01.879
I told you, never let your guard down.

399
00:39:01.964 --> 00:39:03.384
He was only chasing <i>me.</i>

400
00:39:03.466 --> 00:39:04.836
He targeted<i> me.</i>

401
00:39:04.925 --> 00:39:06.385
He knows I'm the weakest.

402
00:39:13.434 --> 00:39:14.984
All of your lessons...

403
00:39:15.770 --> 00:39:17.270
...they mean nothing!

404
00:39:21.400 --> 00:39:22.400
Mowgli!

405
00:39:22.485 --> 00:39:24.145
Bagheera! He's fine.

406
00:39:25.290 --> 00:39:26.290
Let him be.

407
00:39:26.447 --> 00:39:27.777
See ya, freak!

408
00:40:23.587 --> 00:40:24.587
Hey, Mowgli.

409
00:40:25.506 --> 00:40:27.796
Oh!

410
00:40:32.138 --> 00:40:33.138
Ha!

411
00:40:33.431 --> 00:40:35.610
Ah!

412
00:40:39.228 --> 00:40:41.268
I saw that look in your eye

413
00:40:41.355 --> 00:40:43.105
when you were standing over him.

414
00:40:43.190 --> 00:40:45.730
I did what I did because I had to.

415
00:40:45.818 --> 00:40:47.448
Do you think I am stupid?

416
00:40:47.528 --> 00:40:49.908
I saw what you did!

417
00:40:52.320 --> 00:40:55.662
Help! Help! Help!

418
00:40:55.786 --> 00:40:57.286
He was in the lead!

419
00:40:57.580 --> 00:40:59.330
I trained that boy!

420
00:40:59.415 --> 00:41:01.245
Why did you have to do that?

421
00:41:01.333 --> 00:41:03.753
He had to fail!

422
00:41:03.836 --> 00:41:07.860
Why can't you see how much danger he's in?

423
00:41:07.173 --> 00:41:10.130
The pack would have protected him!

424
00:41:11.510 --> 00:41:16.311
Khan will kill him
and tear the pack apart.

425
00:41:17.266 --> 00:41:19.596
You are not the only one

426
00:41:19.685 --> 00:41:21.595
who cares about the boy.

427
00:41:21.687 --> 00:41:24.517
All you care about is that he passed.

428
00:41:24.607 --> 00:41:28.317
That is because it's my job!

429
00:41:28.402 --> 00:41:31.112
Bagheera! Baloo! Up here!

430
00:41:31.197 --> 00:41:33.237
Mowgli's been taken by the monkey-people!

431
00:41:39.121 --> 00:41:40.711
- Mowgli!
- Mowgli!

432
00:42:04.813 --> 00:42:06.730
Let go!

433
00:42:08.484 --> 00:42:09.494
Let me go!

434
00:42:21.997 --> 00:42:23.370
Ah!

435
00:43:59.970 --> 00:44:02.720
My, my.

436
00:44:04.350 --> 00:44:06.690
How you've grown.

437
00:44:10.981 --> 00:44:14.611
And how much chaos
you brought upon the pack.

438
00:44:16.528 --> 00:44:20.868
So much more...

439
00:44:22.201 --> 00:44:23.581
to come.

440
00:44:34.171 --> 00:44:35.171
Just...

441
00:44:36.382 --> 00:44:38.682
a little taste.

442
00:44:51.271 --> 00:44:52.271
Mowgli!

443
00:45:24.972 --> 00:45:26.120
Bagheera!

444
00:45:56.879 --> 00:46:00.339
Let the man-cub alone.

445
00:46:00.799 --> 00:46:02.490
He belongs...

446
00:46:02.342 --> 00:46:04.182
to us.

447
00:46:47.429 --> 00:46:48.429
Kaa...

448
00:46:52.226 --> 00:46:53.806
She saved me.

449
00:47:00.776 --> 00:47:01.776
Why?

450
00:47:23.841 --> 00:47:24.971
Good hunting!

451
00:47:25.634 --> 00:47:26.974
Good hunting all!

452
00:47:29.930 --> 00:47:31.100
Good hunting!

453
00:47:31.223 --> 00:47:32.643
Good hunting all!

454
00:47:35.394 --> 00:47:36.484
Mowgli!

455
00:47:37.271 --> 00:47:38.271
Hey, Mowgli.

456
00:47:44.278 --> 00:47:45.278
Don't worry.

457
00:47:45.737 --> 00:47:47.487
We'll get to join them soon enough.

458
00:47:47.739 --> 00:47:48.909
I just know it.

459
00:47:49.241 --> 00:47:53.701
Mum says, some wolves just need more time.
It doesn't mean we're not good enough.

460
00:47:54.790 --> 00:47:56.579
Hey, why don't we have our own night hunt?

461
00:47:56.957 --> 00:47:59.127
Just you and me.
What do you say?

462
00:48:05.173 --> 00:48:08.263
You've been spending a lot of time
on your own since the monkey-people.

463
00:48:08.510 --> 00:48:09.890
It's not good to be alone.

464
00:48:09.970 --> 00:48:11.690
Wolves are supposed to be
with other wolves.

465
00:48:11.722 --> 00:48:12.722
I'm not a wolf.

466
00:48:17.519 --> 00:48:19.349
Of course you are, Mowgli.

467
00:48:19.438 --> 00:48:20.898
You're the best wolf I know!

468
00:48:21.607 --> 00:48:23.977
Why do you always want to be
around me, Bhoot?

469
00:48:24.359 --> 00:48:26.239
'Cause you're my best friend, Mowgli.

470
00:48:36.380 --> 00:48:37.498
I understand what it's like.

471
00:48:39.820 --> 00:48:40.252
For nobody to want you.

472
00:48:44.463 --> 00:48:46.173
I don't have any friends neither.

473
00:48:47.382 --> 00:48:48.222
But...

474
00:48:48.300 --> 00:48:49.340
we have each other.

475
00:48:50.520 --> 00:48:51.852
And we're kind of same, you and me.

476
00:48:51.929 --> 00:48:53.590
We're not the same.

477
00:48:53.138 --> 00:48:54.308
Of course we are.

478
00:48:54.389 --> 00:48:56.559
Because you're special and I'm special.

479
00:48:56.642 --> 00:48:58.482
We're not special!

480
00:48:59.227 --> 00:49:00.307
Don't you get it?

481
00:49:01.630 --> 00:49:03.573
We'll never be one of them!
We're freaks!

482
00:49:04.274 --> 00:49:06.494
You're not special, Bhoot!

483
00:49:07.110 --> 00:49:10.860
It's just something your mother tells you
to make you feel better about yourself...

484
00:49:10.948 --> 00:49:13.488
because you came out wrong!

485
00:49:31.426 --> 00:49:32.426
Bhoot...

486
00:49:33.679 --> 00:49:34.849
Bhoot, I'm sorry.

487
00:50:38.994 --> 00:50:39.994
Kaa?

488
00:50:44.916 --> 00:50:45.916
Kaa.

489
00:50:46.710 --> 00:50:48.000
Well,

490
00:50:48.754 --> 00:50:50.634
look who's here.

491
00:50:52.716 --> 00:50:54.860
It's the man-cub,

492
00:50:54.593 --> 00:50:58.630
his destiny still uncertain.

493
00:50:59.264 --> 00:51:02.314
Are you afraid of me, man-cub?

494
00:51:04.311 --> 00:51:05.311
No.

495
00:51:07.220 --> 00:51:09.720
Sometimes fear...

496
00:51:09.983 --> 00:51:12.743
is the only intelligent response.

497
00:51:16.364 --> 00:51:17.364
Don't you think?

498
00:51:23.872 --> 00:51:25.712
Say something...

499
00:51:28.710 --> 00:51:30.460
or I shall get bored.

500
00:51:33.673 --> 00:51:35.883
And when I get bored...

501
00:51:37.520 --> 00:51:38.642
I get hungry.

502
00:51:41.560 --> 00:51:42.560
Is it...

503
00:51:43.100 --> 00:51:46.850
Is it true that you know the past
and the future?

504
00:51:47.521 --> 00:51:50.710
What is it you want from me...

505
00:51:50.732 --> 00:51:51.572
man-cub?

506
00:51:51.650 --> 00:51:54.300
Why did you save me
from the monkey-people?

507
00:51:54.778 --> 00:51:58.818
Why do you think
the elephant saved you from the tiger pit?

508
00:52:00.200 --> 00:52:05.400
The whole jungle has been watching you,
man-cub.

509
00:52:06.414 --> 00:52:07.414
Why?

510
00:52:07.874 --> 00:52:11.554
Even you must know you are unusual.

511
00:52:14.214 --> 00:52:16.940
Not quite a wolf,

512
00:52:16.174 --> 00:52:17.594
not quite a man...

513
00:52:18.468 --> 00:52:19.468
or neither...

514
00:52:20.950 --> 00:52:21.950
or both.

515
00:52:41.283 --> 00:52:44.163
I think we can both agree, Mowgli,

516
00:52:44.244 --> 00:52:49.174
that you are something
the jungle has never seen before.

517
00:52:54.671 --> 00:52:56.761
Every day...

518
00:52:57.465 --> 00:53:00.335
you grow a little older.

519
00:53:01.219 --> 00:53:02.469
Every day...

520
00:53:03.388 --> 00:53:06.308
you come a little closer.

521
00:53:08.101 --> 00:53:10.731
One day you will fight...

522
00:53:10.896 --> 00:53:12.160
...and kill.

523
00:53:14.983 --> 00:53:17.283
One day you will speak...

524
00:53:18.278 --> 00:53:21.108
and the jungle will listen.

525
00:53:26.953 --> 00:53:31.430
What will you say then, man-cub?

526
00:53:35.295 --> 00:53:36.295
Do you hear?

527
00:53:36.755 --> 00:53:38.755
The entertainment...

528
00:53:43.470 --> 00:53:45.220
commences.

529
00:53:47.349 --> 00:53:49.389
I shall be watching.

530
00:53:55.650 --> 00:53:57.605
You have no right to be here, Shere Khan!

531
00:53:58.526 --> 00:54:02.986
Well, I think you'll find
I stay where I please.

532
00:54:06.340 --> 00:54:09.440
You kill man's cattle.
You poison the jungle.

533
00:54:09.621 --> 00:54:11.291
You're the reason man is here!

534
00:54:11.373 --> 00:54:14.583
But <i>you</i> permitted man to live among you.

535
00:54:14.876 --> 00:54:17.796
<i>You</i> pretend he is a wolf.

536
00:54:18.255 --> 00:54:21.850
When we both know
that is the one thing he will never be.

537
00:54:21.841 --> 00:54:24.391
He will always be...

538
00:54:24.636 --> 00:54:26.176
a man.

539
00:54:27.130 --> 00:54:28.130
<i>You...</i>

540
00:54:28.556 --> 00:54:30.806
poisoned the jungle.

541
00:54:32.477 --> 00:54:35.557
But you're no longer leader now,

542
00:54:35.647 --> 00:54:36.647
are you?

543
00:54:37.190 --> 00:54:38.650
You missed your kill.

544
00:54:42.445 --> 00:54:43.985
By your law...

545
00:54:45.740 --> 00:54:46.780
your pack...

546
00:54:48.340 --> 00:54:49.334
must challenge you.

547
00:54:51.371 --> 00:54:56.100
Akela's missed his kill!
Akela's missed his kill!

548
00:55:00.839 --> 00:55:04.890
As is our tradition,
whoever defeats me...

549
00:55:05.100 --> 00:55:06.760
will become leader of the pack.

550
00:55:20.984 --> 00:55:21.984
What's happening?

551
00:55:26.310 --> 00:55:26.911
Mowgli!

552
00:55:26.990 --> 00:55:28.160
It's the law.

553
00:55:39.200 --> 00:55:40.200
Who's next?

554
00:56:45.110 --> 00:56:45.940
Who's next?

555
00:56:46.270 --> 00:56:47.270
No!

556
00:56:47.112 --> 00:56:48.322
Mowgli!

557
00:56:56.287 --> 00:56:57.287
No!

558
00:57:11.520 --> 00:57:16.812
If I ever see you here again,
I will set your hide ablaze

559
00:57:16.891 --> 00:57:19.231
and watch you burn alive!

560
00:57:19.310 --> 00:57:22.940
I will taste your blood,

561
00:57:23.356 --> 00:57:24.896
man-cub.

562
00:57:36.411 --> 00:57:37.411
Leave.

563
00:57:43.126 --> 00:57:44.126
What?

564
00:57:44.961 --> 00:57:45.961
You have...

565
00:57:47.500 --> 00:57:49.500
turned the weapons of man...

566
00:57:50.490 --> 00:57:51.129
upon us.

567
00:57:53.136 --> 00:57:55.926
You have brought the pack great shame.

568
00:57:56.431 --> 00:57:57.851
You have brought me...

569
00:57:59.434 --> 00:58:00.524
great shame.

570
00:58:02.937 --> 00:58:03.937
Leave.

571
01:03:09.869 --> 01:03:10.869
- Bagh...
- Shh!

572
01:03:19.879 --> 01:03:21.259
Hello, little brother.

573
01:03:24.509 --> 01:03:26.509
I knew you'd come.

574
01:03:28.346 --> 01:03:30.636
I knew you'd rescue me.

575
01:03:33.559 --> 01:03:34.559
Mowgli...

576
01:03:38.272 --> 01:03:39.982
I have not come to rescue you.

577
01:03:41.692 --> 01:03:43.492
I've come to tell you to stay.

578
01:03:45.905 --> 01:03:46.905
What?

579
01:03:55.373 --> 01:03:58.963
You must stay in the village.
You must not come back to the jungle.

580
01:03:59.430 --> 01:04:02.513
- But the jungle is my home.
- No, it isn't. Not anymore.

581
01:04:02.588 --> 01:04:04.378
I can't stay here.
- Yes, you can. I can't.

582
01:04:07.760 --> 01:04:10.100
You will learn to understand their ways.

583
01:04:10.179 --> 01:04:11.259
You may even grow...

584
01:04:11.347 --> 01:04:13.467
...to like it.

585
01:04:15.170 --> 01:04:16.570
It'll be all right,

586
01:04:16.644 --> 01:04:17.564
little brother.

587
01:04:17.645 --> 01:04:20.855
How do you know? You've never spent a day
outside the jungle.

588
01:04:28.364 --> 01:04:29.954
I was born among man.

589
01:04:35.329 --> 01:04:37.619
I bear the marks of a collar.

590
01:04:39.125 --> 01:04:40.245
Under my chin.

591
01:04:44.755 --> 01:04:47.625
I lived in a king's palace
in a cage just like this.

592
01:04:48.593 --> 01:04:49.763
Fed through a slot.

593
01:04:51.637 --> 01:04:53.570
Man's entertainment.

594
01:04:55.933 --> 01:04:58.943
I only heard stories about the jungle.

595
01:05:02.398 --> 01:05:03.478
When I found you...

596
01:05:04.901 --> 01:05:06.241
all those seasons ago...

597
01:05:08.529 --> 01:05:10.699
...I saw something in you.

598
01:05:12.491 --> 01:05:15.831
And I thought I could teach you.
I thought I could...

599
01:05:18.706 --> 01:05:20.206
...teach you how to belong.

600
01:05:21.208 --> 01:05:23.338
To be like everyone else.

601
01:05:26.881 --> 01:05:28.511
But I was wrong, Mowgli.

602
01:05:29.133 --> 01:05:30.803
You weren't wrong.

603
01:05:35.970 --> 01:05:36.970
I was wrong.

604
01:05:38.893 --> 01:05:40.193
Bagheera...

605
01:05:42.104 --> 01:05:43.564
I love you.

606
01:05:55.826 --> 01:05:57.666
I was another panther...
in that cage, Mowgli.

607
01:06:00.581 --> 01:06:01.581
I bit...

608
01:06:02.375 --> 01:06:03.785
and I scratched...

609
01:06:05.860 --> 01:06:08.460
and I spent my entire life fighting.

610
01:06:10.910 --> 01:06:11.910
Until one day...

611
01:06:12.468 --> 01:06:13.588
I just stopped.

612
01:06:17.974 --> 01:06:19.144
I stopped fighting.

613
01:06:22.353 --> 01:06:23.603
And I gained their trust.

614
01:06:25.189 --> 01:06:27.690
Gain their trust, little brother.

615
01:06:36.117 --> 01:06:37.577
Bagheera...

616
01:06:38.411 --> 01:06:41.410
Don't leave me here.

617
01:06:43.833 --> 01:06:45.843
Come back!

618
01:08:05.289 --> 01:08:06.289
Hey!

619
01:08:36.195 --> 01:08:37.355
Shh-ha.

620
01:08:41.117 --> 01:08:42.117
Shh-ha.

621
01:08:43.661 --> 01:08:44.791
Shh-ha.

622
01:08:55.798 --> 01:08:57.800
You're a fast learner.

623
01:09:02.138 --> 01:09:03.428
Prefer mine cooked.

624
01:09:11.355 --> 01:09:12.895
I, uh, noticed your scar.

625
01:09:21.824 --> 01:09:22.824
Tiger.

626
01:09:26.579 --> 01:09:28.709
Looks like we've both got the same enemy.

627
01:10:07.119 --> 01:10:09.289
It's nothing to worry about.

628
01:10:10.122 --> 01:10:11.122
Hmm?

629
01:10:12.166 --> 01:10:13.666
It's all right, it's nothing.

630
01:10:51.914 --> 01:10:54.214
Here, you can keep this one.

631
01:10:54.291 --> 01:10:55.291
Hmm?

632
01:12:19.626 --> 01:12:20.626
Oh!

633
01:12:52.117 --> 01:12:54.327
It's so you can hunt.

634
01:13:01.251 --> 01:13:02.251
There.

635
01:13:56.723 --> 01:13:57.723
Hello, brother!

636
01:13:59.601 --> 01:14:01.281
Hello, Mowgli. You look different.

637
01:14:14.575 --> 01:14:15.615
Why are you here?

638
01:14:16.118 --> 01:14:17.238
It's Shere Khan.

639
01:14:18.203 --> 01:14:19.293
He's taken over.

640
01:14:20.205 --> 01:14:21.615
We've had to leave home.

641
01:14:21.707 --> 01:14:23.827
Those of us
who still stand by Akela, anyway.

642
01:14:23.917 --> 01:14:25.997
And... the others?

643
01:14:26.295 --> 01:14:28.455
They come in groups, in the night.

644
01:14:29.840 --> 01:14:30.840
Threaten us.

645
01:14:31.842 --> 01:14:32.972
Our own people.

646
01:14:35.679 --> 01:14:37.309
It's not my problem anymore.

647
01:14:37.389 --> 01:14:39.349
- Mowgli...
- It's not my problem.

648
01:14:39.433 --> 01:14:41.853
We've been pushed to the very edge
of the jungle.

649
01:14:42.811 --> 01:14:44.981
And Khan won't stop killing man's cattle.

650
01:14:45.397 --> 01:14:46.397
Brother...

651
01:14:48.108 --> 01:14:50.148
We're afraid of what man might do to us.

652
01:14:54.720 --> 01:14:55.822
The pack needs you, Mowgli.

653
01:14:57.910 --> 01:15:00.000
They didn't need me when I was cast out.

654
01:15:06.710 --> 01:15:07.710
Please! Come home.

655
01:15:20.974 --> 01:15:22.314
This is my home now.

656
01:17:01.742 --> 01:17:02.782
Lockwood,

657
01:17:04.536 --> 01:17:08.616
when will you kill the tiger?
He has killed many cattle.

658
01:17:09.249 --> 01:17:10.379
A clever beast.

659
01:17:12.836 --> 01:17:14.416
Knows how to cover his tracks.

660
01:17:16.798 --> 01:17:20.298
Have you ever missed?

661
01:17:21.261 --> 01:17:22.351
Just once,

662
01:17:23.513 --> 01:17:24.513
just once.

663
01:17:27.170 --> 01:17:29.170
Tiger?

664
01:17:31.647 --> 01:17:32.687
Elephant.

665
01:17:37.270 --> 01:17:39.277
I did get one of his tusks, though.

666
01:17:40.739 --> 01:17:43.329
I have never missed a kill since.

667
01:17:52.834 --> 01:17:55.424
I will get your tiger.

668
01:17:59.257 --> 01:18:01.467
I have no doubt, I will get him.

669
01:18:05.347 --> 01:18:06.347
I will get him.

670
01:20:04.466 --> 01:20:05.716
Beautiful...

671
01:20:06.802 --> 01:20:07.802
isn't he?

672
01:20:12.182 --> 01:20:13.812
My first albino.

673
01:20:18.396 --> 01:20:19.436
And this...

674
01:20:19.981 --> 01:20:22.981
is my own personal menagerie.

675
01:20:29.783 --> 01:20:32.623
You don't understand...

676
01:20:33.787 --> 01:20:35.997
a word I'm saying,

677
01:20:36.810 --> 01:20:37.810
do you?

678
01:20:43.713 --> 01:20:45.673
We can't all be scholars.

679
01:20:49.594 --> 01:20:51.604
Because God knows I'm not.

680
01:21:20.792 --> 01:21:22.172
<i>Mowgli!</i>

681
01:22:48.672 --> 01:22:51.342
I will show you the hunter
who took this...

682
01:22:53.259 --> 01:22:55.929
if you help me rid the jungle
of the tiger.

683
01:23:00.475 --> 01:23:03.305
Shere Khan has brought us
nothing but chaos.

684
01:23:11.486 --> 01:23:13.736
Akela, we must kill the tiger.

685
01:23:15.865 --> 01:23:17.615
I would rather die...

686
01:23:18.326 --> 01:23:20.616
than break with laws of the jungle.

687
01:23:21.788 --> 01:23:23.108
And our people... your friends...

688
01:23:26.209 --> 01:23:27.209
are with me.

689
01:23:28.461 --> 01:23:31.110
But I'm not bound
by those laws any more, Akela,

690
01:23:31.890 --> 01:23:33.509
and this is not the jungle
you once knew.

691
01:23:34.384 --> 01:23:35.764
When you were a cub,

692
01:23:35.844 --> 01:23:39.140
I looked you in the eye and saw no fear.

693
01:23:39.472 --> 01:23:41.312
I believed then...

694
01:23:41.391 --> 01:23:44.811
that, one day,
you would bring peace to the jungle.

695
01:23:46.688 --> 01:23:49.680
But you have become a man now, Mowgli.

696
01:23:49.607 --> 01:23:50.777
I am not a man.

697
01:23:52.277 --> 01:23:53.737
But neither am I a wolf.

698
01:23:59.993 --> 01:24:02.793
- Which of you will follow me?
- We can't, Mowgli.

699
01:24:05.400 --> 01:24:07.710
The jungle law is sacred.

700
01:24:11.212 --> 01:24:12.212
Bagheera.

701
01:24:20.680 --> 01:24:22.640
Tomorrow, the tiger dies.

702
01:25:09.229 --> 01:25:10.309
Khan!

703
01:25:16.903 --> 01:25:19.613
Khan!

704
01:25:19.739 --> 01:25:20.949
The boy needs us, Akela.

705
01:25:25.495 --> 01:25:27.705
Here I am!

706
01:25:30.708 --> 01:25:33.880
Khan!

707
01:25:56.359 --> 01:25:58.319
Look at you,

708
01:25:58.403 --> 01:26:02.913
using a man's tool to do your killing.

709
01:26:05.451 --> 01:26:08.161
What would Baloo and Bagheera think?

710
01:26:18.214 --> 01:26:20.940
What's he doing?

711
01:28:22.964 --> 01:28:24.224
There's your hunter!

712
01:28:34.559 --> 01:28:35.559
Let's go.

713
01:29:12.305 --> 01:29:14.305
You know, I can still hear...

714
01:29:14.974 --> 01:29:16.644
your mother's screams

715
01:29:17.180 --> 01:29:20.188
the night I took her life.

716
01:29:31.616 --> 01:29:32.616
No!

717
01:30:35.221 --> 01:30:36.221
Akela!

718
01:30:41.936 --> 01:30:45.976
Forgive me for doubting you, Mowgli.

719
01:30:50.319 --> 01:30:51.949
It is your time now.

720
01:30:57.577 --> 01:30:58.827
Lead them.

721
01:33:45.578 --> 01:33:47.498
Sleep now, Shere Khan.

722
01:33:48.873 --> 01:33:50.253
Be angry no more.

723
01:34:27.453 --> 01:34:31.423
<i>With the tiger and the hunter now gone,</i>

724
01:34:31.957 --> 01:34:35.997
<i>the future shimmered from darkness...</i>

725
01:34:36.545 --> 01:34:37.795
<i>into light.</i>

726
01:34:38.964 --> 01:34:40.304
<i>Mowgli,</i>

727
01:34:40.591 --> 01:34:42.721
<i>man and wolf,</i>

728
01:34:42.802 --> 01:34:44.892
<i>both and neither,</i>

729
01:34:45.179 --> 01:34:48.599
<i>had given the jungle a voice.</i>

730
01:34:49.100 --> 01:34:51.890
<i>And for as long as he stood watch,</i>

731
01:34:51.977 --> 01:34:56.727
<i>it would speak a lasting peace.</i>
