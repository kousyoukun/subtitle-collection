13

<font color="#ff8000"><i>And then,</i></font>

14
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:10,708
<font color="#ff8000"><i>one fateful night,</i></font>

15
00:02:11,297 --> 00:02:14,627
<font color="#ff8000"><i>I saw the jungle place its hopes</i></font>

19
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:25,232
<font color="#ff8000"><i>it had never seen before.</i></font>

20
00:04:35,483 --> 00:04:36,903
How did it get here?

21
00:04:37,652 --> 00:04:38,702
I don't know.

22
00:04:40,989 --> 00:04:41,989
Is it hurt?

23
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:50,289
There's no wound.

24
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:53,248
It's on its own.

25
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:56,212
I've never seen a man-cub before.

26
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:57,256
It's so...

27
00:04:58,923 --> 00:05:00,223
small.

28
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,470
It doesn't fear us.

29
00:05:05,346 --> 00:05:07,096
What are we going to do with it?

30
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:12,691
Evening, Nisha.

31
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:13,692
Vihaan.

32
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:18,356
It's a lovely night, isn't it?
What is it that you want, Tabaqui?

33
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:20,360
What's that I smell?
Fresh kill?

34
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:22,315
If it's bones you're after,
look elsewhere.

35
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:24,986
We have enough mouths to feed.

36
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:29,077
I meant no harm, Nisha.

37
00:05:39,088 --> 00:05:40,338
Your master calls.

38
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,050
You best go quickly.

39
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:44,839
He sounds in ill temper tonight.

40
00:05:44,927 --> 00:05:46,597
That he does. That he does.

41
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:50,480
And with good reason.

42
00:05:53,436 --> 00:05:56,396
I found the man-cub!
I found the man-cub!

43
00:05:56,481 --> 00:05:57,771
Finish cleaning him off.

44
00:05:57,857 --> 00:05:59,107
Nisha.
Clean him!

45
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,190
Where are you going?
To Akela.

46
00:06:01,903 --> 00:06:04,113
A council must be held
if we are to keep him.

47
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:06,659
Keep him?
Don't let him out of your sight.

48
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:09,121
We can't keep him!

49
00:06:19,295 --> 00:06:21,376
Nisha, you have called council.

50
00:06:22,001 --> 00:06:23,379
What's the matter at hand?

51
00:06:24,133 --> 00:06:25,303
We've found...

52
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:28,727
a man-cub.

53
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:34,092
That's not a wolf.

54
00:06:34,117 --> 00:06:36,075
That doesn't belong here.
A man-cub!

55
00:06:36,099 --> 00:06:37,299
Outrageous.

56
00:06:39,107 --> 00:06:41,727
Well, this is most unusual indeed.

57
00:06:43,277 --> 00:06:46,487
Nisha, you wish to raise this cub
as if he were your own?

58
00:06:47,281 --> 00:06:48,321
I do.

59
00:06:49,158 --> 00:06:50,088
And Vihaan?

60
00:06:51,179 --> 00:06:52,079
You, too?

61
00:06:53,204 --> 00:06:54,044
I do.

62
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:55,292
It's a man-cub!

63
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:56,540
You know the law.

64
00:06:58,459 --> 00:07:00,169
This cub was not born among us.

65
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:02,655
So who here,

66
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:04,521
speaks for the cub?

67
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:06,985
I speak for the cub.

68
00:07:09,387 --> 00:07:12,347
The law states, that the life of a cub,

69
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:13,919
may be bought,

70
00:07:14,475 --> 00:07:15,475
for a price.

71
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:18,193
I brought my payment.

72
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:19,651
We have one.

73
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:23,364
Who else will speak for the cub?

74
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:25,337
Baloo does.

75
00:07:25,528 --> 00:07:26,568
Baloo?

76
00:07:27,196 --> 00:07:28,748
Bagheera.
He's not a wolf.

77
00:07:28,973 --> 00:07:30,050
He has no say.

78
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:32,756
He was the teacher of your cubs.
That makes him a member of the pack.

79
00:07:33,661 --> 00:07:36,021
I aingt speaking for no...

80
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:37,963
man-cub.

81
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:40,535
Bagheera, have you lost your mind?

82
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,690
A man-cub living in a jungle?

83
00:07:58,603 --> 00:07:59,603
Akela,

84
00:07:59,687 --> 00:08:01,637
his parents will come.

85
00:08:03,024 --> 00:08:07,084
His parents are dead.

86
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:09,726
I killed them.

87
00:08:11,532 --> 00:08:15,412
There is no one to come looking for him.

88
00:08:17,538 --> 00:08:19,748
This is not your concern, Shere Khan.

89
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:21,382
The cub is mine.

90
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:24,199
I have already tasted its mother's blood.

91
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:27,795
It is my right.

92
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:29,972
Your right according to who's law?

93
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:31,261
Best you leave now.

94
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:34,974
Careful, Akela.

95
00:08:35,431 --> 00:08:38,181
You do not want to challenge me.

96
00:08:40,061 --> 00:08:41,061
This cub...

97
00:08:42,104 --> 00:08:44,234
is under the protection of the pack.

98
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:47,187
Should you decide to take me,

99
00:08:47,818 --> 00:08:50,068
you take on the pack.

100
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:52,239
All of us.

101
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:57,580
As long as I am leader,

102
00:08:58,287 --> 00:09:00,917
this part of the jungle is closed to you.

103
00:09:04,335 --> 00:09:07,955
You cannot be leader forever.

104
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:10,718
The day you miss your kill,

105
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:14,514
the man-cub's blood

106
00:09:14,845 --> 00:09:18,805
will run down my chin.

107
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:32,263
The cub is spoken for.

108
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:34,068
He is one of us.

109
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:36,664
You will teach him as you would your own.

110
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:38,907
As long as I am alive,

111
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:41,712
the pack will stand by the man-cub.

112
00:10:51,442 --> 00:10:54,862
Hunting is sacred, little brother.

113
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:57,740
It is our right.

114
00:10:59,408 --> 00:11:02,908
But we never do it for sport.

115
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:22,430
Wait. Wait.

116
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,440
We look them in the eye,

117
00:11:27,603 --> 00:11:28,943
so that the soul,

118
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:31,265
doesn't depart alone.

119
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:08,980
Bagheera.

120
00:12:19,864 --> 00:12:21,914
How old is the jungle, Bagheera?

121
00:12:22,491 --> 00:12:25,411
The jungle has been here
since before you were born

122
00:12:25,494 --> 00:12:27,294
and it will be here...

123
00:12:30,499 --> 00:12:31,999
after you die.

124
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:34,841
The jungle is eternal.

125
00:12:35,629 --> 00:12:36,799
Bagheera...

126
00:12:38,507 --> 00:12:42,427
why am I different to the other wolves?

127
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:51,768
You are no different,

128
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:53,645
little brother.

129
00:12:55,316 --> 00:12:57,436
You are special.

130
00:12:58,402 --> 00:13:00,112
Of course you're different.

131
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,180
That's why you need special training.

132
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:05,623
You know what your trouble is?

133
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:07,452
Lack of focus.

134
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:08,950
Baloo,

135
00:13:09,413 --> 00:13:11,463
how many ants can you fit in your mouth?

136
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:13,377
Ants are really small,

137
00:13:13,834 --> 00:13:15,844
and your mouth is really big.

138
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:19,424
I bet...
Mowgli, will you concentrate?

139
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:27,260
Do...

140
00:13:28,184 --> 00:13:29,284
not...

141
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:31,476
move.

142
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:38,827
Why do I have to do this?

143
00:13:38,852 --> 00:13:39,927
Because I said so.

144
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:41,695
Tell me the three laws, now.

145
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:43,569
No wolf shall have contact with man.

146
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:44,916
Next.
Baloo?

147
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:47,586
What happened to your tail?

148
00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:48,352
Next!

149
00:13:48,777 --> 00:13:50,757
No wolf shall hunt man's animals.

150
00:13:51,288 --> 00:13:53,898
Above all, the cow, which is sacred!

151
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:55,438
Did it fall off?

152
00:13:56,163 --> 00:13:57,570
Is that why you don't have one?

153
00:13:57,628 --> 00:13:59,448
What? Why haven't you got a tail?

154
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:00,357
I don't know.

155
00:14:00,782 --> 00:14:02,284
I never really thought about it.

156
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:03,511
Third law.

157
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:04,641
Now!

158
00:14:04,718 --> 00:14:06,536
No wolf shall kill man in the jungle,

159
00:14:06,661 --> 00:14:08,282
for killing man only brings danger.

160
00:14:08,947 --> 00:14:10,547
Well. Least you know your laws.

161
00:14:10,632 --> 00:14:13,622
Now, we just got to get you
to run as fast as the other wolves.

162
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:20,396
Don't let your guard down.

163
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:24,201
All right,
that's enough for today, Mowgli.

164
00:14:25,406 --> 00:14:27,317
Straight back to the caves.
No wandering.

165
00:14:27,642 --> 00:14:29,220
Run like a wolf, do you hear?

166
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:32,120
I can't hear you!

167
00:15:11,952 --> 00:15:13,002
Mowgli!

168
00:15:13,829 --> 00:15:14,909
Hey, Mowgli.

169
00:15:15,706 --> 00:15:17,626
Bhoot!
What are you doing?

170
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:20,093
Nothing.
Hey, do you want to play?

171
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:22,629
Got ya!

172
00:15:26,133 --> 00:15:28,053
I nearly had you.

173
00:15:29,845 --> 00:15:30,965
You're good at hiding.

174
00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:32,747
Mum taught me how to hide.

175
00:15:32,972 --> 00:15:34,889
She shows me loads of tricks.

176
00:15:36,226 --> 00:15:37,766
So I can protect myself.

177
00:15:37,953 --> 00:15:40,523
She says, others can mistake,

178
00:15:40,731 --> 00:15:42,821
individuality for weakness.

179
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:45,392
That's why they have
a go at me sometimes.

180
00:15:47,112 --> 00:15:47,952
Yeah.

181
00:15:48,697 --> 00:15:49,527
Me, too.

182
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:51,992
Come on.
I'll race you home.

183
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:55,119
On my call.

184
00:15:56,163 --> 00:15:57,043
Go!

185
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:12,143
Hey.

186
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:14,641
Hey, brother.

187
00:16:15,891 --> 00:16:17,641
What did Baloo make you do today?

188
00:16:17,726 --> 00:16:20,096
Put a scorpion on me
and told me not to move.

189
00:16:20,354 --> 00:16:21,944
He says I lack focus.

190
00:16:22,272 --> 00:16:23,952
Baloo says that to all of us.

191
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:26,263
How was your lesson?

192
00:16:26,388 --> 00:16:26,841
Fine.

193
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:28,696
Your brother tells me
you're getting faster.

194
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:30,699
He can nearly keep pace with me.

195
00:16:30,781 --> 00:16:32,241
He can almost beat Bhoot.

196
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:35,201
Yeah, he should just race
with his freak friend!

197
00:16:35,285 --> 00:16:37,745
It's only natural they spend
so much time with each other.

198
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:39,370
Freaks have to stick together.

199
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:43,882
That's enough.

200
00:16:44,795 --> 00:16:45,795
That really hurt.

201
00:16:45,879 --> 00:16:46,799
Inside, now.

202
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:48,795
Thanks.

203
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:51,640
You shouldn't let them pick on you
like that.

204
00:16:52,386 --> 00:16:53,796
We were only playing.

205
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:55,143
Better go home, Bhoot.

206
00:16:55,806 --> 00:16:56,676
Bye, Mowgli!

207
00:16:57,141 --> 00:16:58,636
I meant what I said to Mum.

208
00:16:58,661 --> 00:17:00,045
You are getting faster.

209
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:02,152
Your father was never
much of a runner either.

210
00:17:02,229 --> 00:17:03,164
It's true.

211
00:17:03,389 --> 00:17:04,793
I was the slowest in my group.

212
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:07,897
I never thought I was gonna complete
in the Running. I was sure I would fail.

213
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:09,922
You're going to be late.

214
00:17:10,247 --> 00:17:11,734
Have a good hunt, Father.

215
00:17:11,797 --> 00:17:13,795
Before you know it, you'll
be coming along with me.

216
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:15,151
All of you!

217
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:19,659
Good hunting!
Good hunting all!

218
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:31,590
This is the jungle!

219
00:17:32,801 --> 00:17:35,261
In the jungle, we all hunt.

220
00:17:35,345 --> 00:17:36,375
And...

221
00:17:36,764 --> 00:17:39,394
we are all hunted.

222
00:17:39,683 --> 00:17:41,023
You see what that means.

223
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:43,230
It means that you...

224
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:45,311
you don't want to get caught.

225
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:50,593
That's why you can't join the pack,

226
00:17:51,278 --> 00:17:54,528
until you have passed the Running.
Pay attention!

227
00:18:01,163 --> 00:18:02,623
What's the Running, Baloo?

228
00:18:03,874 --> 00:18:06,924
The Running is the hunt where you...

229
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:09,208
are the prey.

230
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:13,054
Now, Bagheera here.

231
00:18:13,133 --> 00:18:14,833
You all know Bagheera, don't you?

232
00:18:14,857 --> 00:18:16,720
Yeah, Bagheera, friendly Bagheera.

233
00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:18,429
In the Running,

234
00:18:18,954 --> 00:18:20,453
Bagheera will hunt you,

235
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:21,926
and if he catches you...

236
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:23,733
you fail.

237
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:26,763
What happens if you fail, Baloo?

238
00:18:26,887 --> 00:18:28,687
You don't join the pack!

239
00:18:33,987 --> 00:18:36,367
But I've never had one of my cubs fail.

240
00:18:39,034 --> 00:18:40,364
And I'm not gonna start now.

241
00:18:44,998 --> 00:18:45,828
Good.

242
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:47,708
Let's practice, shall we?

243
00:18:52,673 --> 00:18:53,673
On my call.

244
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:55,425
Wait.

245
00:18:55,850 --> 00:18:57,397
Wait.

246
00:18:59,263 --> 00:18:59,963
Go!

247
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:02,807
Come on, now!

248
00:19:04,893 --> 00:19:06,023
Pick up the pace!

249
00:19:09,857 --> 00:19:11,277
Come on!

250
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:14,485
Faster!

251
00:20:13,754 --> 00:20:15,714
You were with the monkey-people,

252
00:20:16,089 --> 00:20:17,009
again.

253
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:22,552
The monkey-people have no law,

254
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:24,597
they're unpredictable,

255
00:20:24,681 --> 00:20:26,481
and they can't even speak proper.

256
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:28,308
I think they're funny.

257
00:20:28,333 --> 00:20:30,386
There's nothin funny about them.

258
00:20:30,646 --> 00:20:32,306
You keep away, do you understand?

259
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:33,626
I'm not afraid of them.

260
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:36,111
Only fools feel no fear, Mowgli.

261
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:39,030
The monkey-people are especially foolish.

262
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:40,989
There's nothing they're afraid of.

263
00:20:41,615 --> 00:20:43,445
Well, except Kaa.

264
00:20:44,618 --> 00:20:46,698
Oh, they can't even lay eyes on her.

265
00:20:46,787 --> 00:20:47,747
Who's Kaa?

266
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:50,497
Oh, you don't want to meet Kaa.

267
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,930
Kaa the Python,

268
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:55,250
is as old as the jungle.

269
00:20:56,797 --> 00:20:58,757
She sees the past...

270
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:00,764
and the future.

271
00:21:04,813 --> 00:21:05,853
Turn around!

272
00:21:09,877 --> 00:21:10,877
Eyes forward.

273
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:21,276
The cow had been killed
and left there to be found.

274
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:23,475
It's the tiger!
He's come back!

275
00:21:23,499 --> 00:21:27,607
Only Khan woul kill man's cattle.

276
00:21:27,761 --> 00:21:29,251
One man-cub will bring more men!

277
00:21:29,276 --> 00:21:30,276
It's Shere Khan!

278
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:32,700
Akela, we knew this would happen!
We told you!

279
00:21:32,724 --> 00:21:36,340
Can't you see, Akela,
the man-cub is putting us all in danger.

280
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:38,496
You were wrong to ever take him in!

281
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:40,973
We should give him to the tiger!

282
00:21:40,974 --> 00:21:42,394
Akela, no!
Save the pack!

283
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:43,965
Please.

284
00:21:45,804 --> 00:21:47,064
He is one of us.

285
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:51,889
I will see to this matter.

286
00:21:52,561 --> 00:21:53,401
Go!

287
00:22:05,073 --> 00:22:07,583
Shere Khan wants to bring war
to the jungle.

288
00:22:08,702 --> 00:22:09,542
War?

289
00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:11,609
With man?

290
00:22:11,734 --> 00:22:13,039
Is he out of his mind?

291
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:13,870
War with me.

292
00:22:15,959 --> 00:22:17,419
He knows I'm getting old.

293
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:20,549
This is his way of bringing chaos
to the pack.

294
00:22:21,214 --> 00:22:22,544
Khan wants the boy.

295
00:22:22,569 --> 00:22:24,038
We can protect him.

296
00:22:24,092 --> 00:22:26,972
You know there is only one way
to protect him.

297
00:22:27,512 --> 00:22:29,432
He must go to the man village.

298
00:22:30,057 --> 00:22:31,677
You're forgetting Bagheera,

299
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:34,897
this was always more
than just a good deed.

300
00:22:35,479 --> 00:22:36,939
The jungle is changing.

301
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:41,443
Man is taking more of it
as each season passes.

302
00:22:42,736 --> 00:22:43,606
And the boy,

303
00:22:44,446 --> 00:22:47,696
may just be our only hope of survival.

304
00:22:48,492 --> 00:22:50,872
The jungle is no longer safe for him.

305
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:52,978
The pack won't accept him.

306
00:22:53,002 --> 00:22:55,192
They will if he passes the Running.

307
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:57,134
Baloo, is he ready?

308
00:22:57,209 --> 00:22:59,229
Of course he's not ready.
He's not a wolf.

309
00:22:59,411 --> 00:23:01,001
Then make him ready.

310
00:23:06,968 --> 00:23:09,388
Right, no more messing about.

311
00:23:10,105 --> 00:23:11,895
Can you run as fast as a wolf?

312
00:23:12,641 --> 00:23:13,831
No, you can't.

313
00:23:14,518 --> 00:23:18,608
You've got hands with fingers on the ends,
so let's use them.

314
00:23:18,688 --> 00:23:19,518
What?

315
00:23:20,315 --> 00:23:22,395
Now jump, to there.

316
00:23:23,318 --> 00:23:24,438
Come on, hurry up.

317
00:23:32,536 --> 00:23:33,406
Again.

318
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:36,920
Oh, nearly!

319
00:23:45,507 --> 00:23:46,797
Yes!
Baloo!

320
00:26:58,116 --> 00:26:59,076
What happened?

321
00:27:24,768 --> 00:27:26,098
Come on, little brother.

322
00:27:26,645 --> 00:27:27,595
Time to go home.

323
00:27:51,086 --> 00:27:53,026
Do you know why those men have come?

324
00:27:56,424 --> 00:27:59,764
They've come to hunt the tiger
that steals their cattle.

325
00:28:00,136 --> 00:28:01,196
Will they kill him?

326
00:28:01,221 --> 00:28:02,280
It won't be easy.

327
00:28:03,682 --> 00:28:06,432
Shere Khan is clever.

328
00:28:08,061 --> 00:28:09,191
Very dangerous.

329
00:28:12,774 --> 00:28:13,734
Mowgli...

330
00:28:15,318 --> 00:28:17,398
the jungle is no longer safe for you.

331
00:28:19,114 --> 00:28:23,084
But if you were to be in a place
where Shere Khan would never go,

332
00:28:23,827 --> 00:28:25,297
then you would be safe.

333
00:28:26,329 --> 00:28:27,959
Where does Shere Khan never go?

334
00:28:30,417 --> 00:28:32,667
You know, the man village.

335
00:28:33,169 --> 00:28:34,499
Why would I go there?

336
00:28:39,676 --> 00:28:41,586
Because you are a man-cub.

337
00:28:44,764 --> 00:28:47,024
I have seen the way
you look at the village.

338
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:50,560
You are one of them.

339
00:28:52,021 --> 00:28:53,111
I'm a wolf.

340
00:28:53,189 --> 00:28:54,229
Mowgli.

341
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:01,744
He wants your blood, little brother.

342
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:04,910
It was Shere Khan
who killed your man-parents

343
00:29:04,993 --> 00:29:06,663
all those seasons ago,

344
00:29:07,287 --> 00:29:09,707
and now he wants to kill you.

345
00:29:11,416 --> 00:29:12,666
The pack will protect me.

346
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:14,291
If you fail the Running...

347
00:29:14,377 --> 00:29:15,247
I won't fail.

348
00:29:15,336 --> 00:29:16,296
You won't...

349
00:29:17,213 --> 00:29:18,673
be able to join the pack.

350
00:29:19,048 --> 00:29:20,628
I won't fail!

351
00:29:22,385 --> 00:29:23,755
Then promise me this.

352
00:29:25,472 --> 00:29:26,722
If you do fail...

353
00:29:28,016 --> 00:29:29,596
you will go to the village.

354
00:29:30,935 --> 00:29:32,185
Promise me Mowgli.

355
00:29:58,213 --> 00:29:59,763
Good evening!

356
00:30:23,029 --> 00:30:25,409
Don't worry. I'll kill your tiger.

357
00:30:25,573 --> 00:30:27,123
How many's he taken this time?

358
00:30:28,201 --> 00:30:29,041
Careful!

359
00:30:29,536 --> 00:30:30,746
Quickly, now. Come on.

360
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:12,872
Did you smell the blood, man-cub?

361
00:31:14,163 --> 00:31:15,293
What is it?

362
00:31:19,168 --> 00:31:21,592
The creature that did
that to your tail.

363
00:31:21,917 --> 00:31:23,112
It's called fire.

364
00:31:24,007 --> 00:31:25,627
It's hotter than the sun.

365
00:31:26,968 --> 00:31:28,868
And it's quicker than the panther.

366
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:33,222
Your kind use dark magic, man-cub.

367
00:31:33,408 --> 00:31:34,948
They're not my kind.

368
00:31:41,524 --> 00:31:42,404
Sometimes...

369
00:31:43,484 --> 00:31:45,364
I dream I'm a tiger.

370
00:31:47,113 --> 00:31:49,163
But I always wake up a hyena.

371
00:32:12,388 --> 00:32:14,388
You should try and get some sleep.

372
00:32:19,729 --> 00:32:21,649
You'll want to be rested for tomorrow.

373
00:32:31,491 --> 00:32:33,201
What's bothering you, my love?

374
00:32:34,827 --> 00:32:36,747
All I've ever wanted...

375
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:40,377
my whole life...

376
00:32:42,377 --> 00:32:43,707
is to be a wolf.

377
00:32:47,882 --> 00:32:50,182
For the others to see me as an...

378
00:32:52,345 --> 00:32:53,175
equal.

379
00:32:56,474 --> 00:32:58,944
This is my chance to prove myself.

380
00:33:00,269 --> 00:33:02,109
To prove that I'm one of them.

381
00:33:04,023 --> 00:33:05,403
To prove that I belong.

382
00:33:05,483 --> 00:33:06,483
You belong.

383
00:33:10,363 --> 00:33:11,863
You belong, Mowgli.

384
00:33:14,492 --> 00:33:17,792
Don't ever let anyone
make you think otherwise.

385
00:33:21,207 --> 00:33:23,667
You will always be my son, Mowgli.

386
00:33:26,212 --> 00:33:28,132
Nothing can ever change that.

387
00:33:59,203 --> 00:34:01,083
You are about to take part,

388
00:34:01,372 --> 00:34:03,332
in one of our oldest traditions.

389
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:06,586
The Running of the Pack.

390
00:34:07,628 --> 00:34:09,458
Those of you who pass the test...

391
00:34:10,965 --> 00:34:12,335
will have earned the right...

392
00:34:13,301 --> 00:34:14,261
to join us...

393
00:34:14,969 --> 00:34:16,049
in the night hunt.

394
00:34:19,307 --> 00:34:20,677
As is customary...

395
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:24,600
Bagheera will perform his task as chaser.

396
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:29,030
Mowgli!

397
00:34:29,609 --> 00:34:30,989
Good luck, Mowgli!

398
00:34:41,204 --> 00:34:42,334
Face the hill.

399
00:34:48,711 --> 00:34:49,801
Good luck, brother.

400
00:34:49,879 --> 00:34:51,065
I must warn you,

401
00:34:51,390 --> 00:34:54,303
Bagheera has been told
not to hold back.

402
00:34:59,972 --> 00:35:00,972
On my call.

403
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:07,778
Go!

404
00:35:19,826 --> 00:35:20,656
Bagheera.

405
00:35:21,619 --> 00:35:22,499
If you will.

406
00:36:06,247 --> 00:36:07,957
Out of my way, freak!

407
00:38:04,991 --> 00:38:06,411
Let him go, Bagheera.

408
00:38:08,577 --> 00:38:09,407
Bagheera...

409
00:38:32,376 --> 00:38:33,286
Get up.

410
00:38:54,749 --> 00:38:56,709
You let your guard down.

411
00:38:58,419 --> 00:39:01,879
I told you, never let your guard down.

412
00:39:01,964 --> 00:39:03,384
He was only chasing <i>me.</i>

413
00:39:03,466 --> 00:39:04,836
He targeted me.

414
00:39:05,025 --> 00:39:06,485
He knows I'm the weakest.

415
00:39:13,434 --> 00:39:14,984
All of your lessons...

416
00:39:16,103 --> 00:39:17,273
they mean nothing!

417
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:22,400
Mowgli!

418
00:39:22,485 --> 00:39:23,485
Bagheera!

419
00:39:23,809 --> 00:39:24,809
He's fine.

420
00:39:25,029 --> 00:39:25,949
Let him be.

421
00:39:26,447 --> 00:39:27,777
See you, freak!

422
00:40:23,587 --> 00:40:24,587
Hey, Mowgli.

423
00:40:39,228 --> 00:40:41,268
I saw that look in your eye,

424
00:40:41,455 --> 00:40:43,105
when you were standing over him.

425
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:45,730
I did what I did because I had to.

426
00:40:45,818 --> 00:40:47,448
Do you think I am stupid?

427
00:40:47,528 --> 00:40:49,908
I saw what you did!

428
00:40:52,032 --> 00:40:55,662
Help! Help! Help!

429
00:40:55,786 --> 00:40:57,286
He was in the lead!

430
00:40:57,580 --> 00:40:59,330
I trained that boy!

431
00:40:59,415 --> 00:41:01,245
Why did you have to do that?

432
00:41:01,333 --> 00:41:02,793
He had to fail!

433
00:41:03,836 --> 00:41:07,086
Why can't you see
how much danger he's in?

434
00:41:07,173 --> 00:41:10,013
The pack would have protected him!

435
00:41:11,051 --> 00:41:16,311
Khan will kill him
and tear the pack apart.

436
00:41:17,266 --> 00:41:19,596
You are not the only one

437
00:41:19,685 --> 00:41:21,495
who cares about the boy.

438
00:41:21,687 --> 00:41:24,517
All you care about is that he passed.

439
00:41:24,607 --> 00:41:28,317
That is because it's my job!

440
00:41:29,278 --> 00:41:31,108
Bagheera! Baloo! Up here!

441
00:41:31,197 --> 00:41:33,337
Mowgli's been taken
by the monkey-people!

442
00:41:39,121 --> 00:41:40,711
Mowgli!

443
00:42:05,189 --> 00:42:06,069
Let go!

444
00:42:08,484 --> 00:42:09,494
Let me go!

445
00:43:59,970 --> 00:44:02,720
My, my.

446
00:44:04,350 --> 00:44:06,690
How you've grown.

447
00:44:11,148 --> 00:44:14,418
And how much chaos
you brought upon the pack.

448
00:44:16,528 --> 00:44:20,868
So much more...

449
00:44:22,201 --> 00:44:23,581
to come.

450
00:44:34,171 --> 00:44:35,011
Just...

451
00:44:36,382 --> 00:44:38,682
a little taste.

452
00:44:51,271 --> 00:44:52,191
Mowgli!

453
00:45:24,972 --> 00:45:26,012
Bagheera!

454
00:45:56,879 --> 00:46:00,339
Let the man-cub alone.

455
00:46:00,799 --> 00:46:02,049
He belongs...

456
00:46:02,342 --> 00:46:04,092
to us.

457
00:46:47,429 --> 00:46:48,259
Kaa...

458
00:46:52,226 --> 00:46:53,806
She saved me.

459
00:47:00,776 --> 00:47:01,606
Why?

460
00:47:23,841 --> 00:47:24,971
Good hunting!

461
00:47:25,634 --> 00:47:26,974
Good hunting all!

462
00:47:29,930 --> 00:47:31,010
Good hunting!

463
00:47:31,223 --> 00:47:32,643
Good hunting all!

464
00:47:35,394 --> 00:47:36,484
Mowgli!

465
00:47:37,271 --> 00:47:38,231
Hey, Mowgli.

466
00:47:44,278 --> 00:47:45,278
Don't worry.

467
00:47:45,737 --> 00:47:47,487
We'll get to join them soon enough.

468
00:47:47,739 --> 00:47:48,909
I just know it.

469
00:47:49,241 --> 00:47:51,754
Mum says, some wolves
just need more time.

470
00:47:52,079 --> 00:47:53,725
It doesn't mean we're
not good enough.

471
00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:56,579
Hey, why don't we have
our own night hunt?

472
00:47:56,957 --> 00:47:58,927
Just you and me.
What do you say?

473
00:48:05,173 --> 00:48:08,263
You've been spending a lot of time
on your own since the monkey-people.

474
00:48:08,510 --> 00:48:09,890
It's not good to be alone.

475
00:48:09,970 --> 00:48:11,640
Wolves are supposed to be
with other wolves.

476
00:48:11,722 --> 00:48:12,782
I'm not a wolf.

477
00:48:17,519 --> 00:48:19,349
Of course you are, Mowgli.

478
00:48:19,438 --> 00:48:20,998
You're the best wolf I know!

479
00:48:21,607 --> 00:48:23,577
Why do you always want to be
around me, Bhoot?

480
00:48:24,359 --> 00:48:26,239
Because you're my best friend, Mowgli.

481
00:48:36,038 --> 00:48:37,498
I understand what it's like.

482
00:48:39,082 --> 00:48:40,252
For nobody to want you.

483
00:48:44,463 --> 00:48:46,173
I don't have any friends neither.

484
00:48:47,382 --> 00:48:48,222
But...

485
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:49,510
we have each other.

486
00:48:50,052 --> 00:48:51,852
And we're kind of same, you and me.

487
00:48:51,929 --> 00:48:53,059
We're not the same.

488
00:48:53,138 --> 00:48:54,308
Of course we are.

489
00:48:54,389 --> 00:48:56,559
Because you're special and I'm special.

490
00:48:56,642 --> 00:48:58,482
We're not special!

491
00:48:59,227 --> 00:49:00,307
Don't you get it?

492
00:49:01,063 --> 00:49:03,573
We'll never be one of them!
We're freaks!

493
00:49:04,274 --> 00:49:06,494
You're not special, Bhoot!

494
00:49:07,110 --> 00:49:10,860
It's just something your mother tells you
to make you feel better about yourself,

495
00:49:10,948 --> 00:49:13,488
because you came out wrong!

496
00:49:31,426 --> 00:49:32,256
Bhoot...

497
00:49:33,679 --> 00:49:34,849
Bhoot, I'm sorry.

498
00:50:38,994 --> 00:50:39,834
Kaa?

499
00:50:44,916 --> 00:50:45,786
Kaa?

500
00:50:46,710 --> 00:50:48,000
Well,

501
00:50:48,754 --> 00:50:50,634
look who's here.

502
00:50:52,716 --> 00:50:54,086
It's the man-cub,

503
00:50:54,593 --> 00:50:58,063
his destiny still uncertain.

504
00:50:59,264 --> 00:51:02,314
Are you afraid of me, man-cub?

505
00:51:04,311 --> 00:51:05,151
No.

506
00:51:07,022 --> 00:51:09,072
Sometimes, fear...

507
00:51:09,983 --> 00:51:12,743
is the only intelligent response.

508
00:51:16,364 --> 00:51:17,414
Don't you think?

509
00:51:23,872 --> 00:51:25,712
Say something...

510
00:51:28,710 --> 00:51:30,460
or I shall get bored.

511
00:51:33,673 --> 00:51:35,883
And when I get bored...

512
00:51:37,052 --> 00:51:38,642
I get hungry.

513
00:51:41,056 --> 00:51:41,886
Is it...

514
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:46,850
Is it true that you know the past
and the future?

515
00:51:47,521 --> 00:51:50,071
What is it you want from me,

516
00:51:50,732 --> 00:51:51,572
man-cub?

517
00:51:51,650 --> 00:51:54,150
Why did you save me
from the monkey-people?

518
00:51:54,778 --> 00:51:58,818
Why do you think the elephant
saved you from the tiger pit?

519
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:05,040
The whole jungle has been
watching you, man-cub.

520
00:52:06,414 --> 00:52:07,334
Why?

521
00:52:07,874 --> 00:52:11,554
Even you must know you are unusual.

522
00:52:14,214 --> 00:52:16,094
Not quite a wolf,

523
00:52:16,174 --> 00:52:17,594
not quite a man...

524
00:52:18,468 --> 00:52:19,428
or neither...

525
00:52:20,095 --> 00:52:21,095
or both.

526
00:52:41,283 --> 00:52:44,163
I think we can both agree, Mowgli,

527
00:52:44,244 --> 00:52:49,174
that you are something
the jungle has never seen before.

528
00:52:54,671 --> 00:52:56,761
Every day,

529
00:52:57,465 --> 00:53:00,335
you grow a little older.

530
00:53:01,219 --> 00:53:02,469
Every day,

531
00:53:03,388 --> 00:53:06,308
you come a little closer.

532
00:53:08,101 --> 00:53:10,731
One day you will fight...

533
00:53:10,896 --> 00:53:12,016
and kill.

534
00:53:14,983 --> 00:53:17,283
One day you will speak...

535
00:53:18,278 --> 00:53:21,108
and the jungle will listen.

536
00:53:26,953 --> 00:53:31,043
What will you say then, man-cub?

537
00:53:35,295 --> 00:53:36,125
Do you hear?

538
00:53:41,051 --> 00:53:43,051
The entertainment,

539
00:53:43,470 --> 00:53:45,220
commences.

540
00:53:47,349 --> 00:53:49,389
I shall be watching.

541
00:53:55,065 --> 00:53:57,605
You have no right to be here, Shere Khan!

542
00:53:58,526 --> 00:54:02,986
Well, I think you'll find
I stay where I please.

543
00:54:06,034 --> 00:54:09,044
You kill man's cattle.
You poison the jungle.

544
00:54:09,621 --> 00:54:11,291
You're the reason man is here!

545
00:54:11,373 --> 00:54:14,583
But you permitted man
to live among you.

546
00:54:14,876 --> 00:54:17,796
You pretend he is a wolf.

547
00:54:18,255 --> 00:54:21,085
When we both know
that is the one thing he will never be.

548
00:54:21,841 --> 00:54:24,391
He will always be,

549
00:54:24,636 --> 00:54:26,176
a man.

550
00:54:27,013 --> 00:54:27,933
You...

551
00:54:28,556 --> 00:54:30,806
poisoned the jungle.

552
00:54:32,477 --> 00:54:35,557
But you're no longer leader now,

553
00:54:35,647 --> 00:54:36,607
are you?

554
00:54:37,190 --> 00:54:38,650
You missed your kill.

555
00:54:42,445 --> 00:54:43,985
By your law...

556
00:54:45,740 --> 00:54:46,780
your pack...

557
00:54:48,034 --> 00:54:49,334
must challenge you.

558
00:54:51,371 --> 00:54:53,593
Akela's missed his kill!

559
00:54:53,818 --> 00:54:56,225
Akela's missed his kill!

560
00:55:00,839 --> 00:55:02,351
As is our tradition,

561
00:55:02,376 --> 00:55:04,113
whoever defeats me...

562
00:55:05,093 --> 00:55:06,853
will become leader of the pack.

563
00:55:20,984 --> 00:55:21,864
What's happening?

564
00:55:26,031 --> 00:55:26,911
Mowgli!

565
00:55:26,990 --> 00:55:28,160
It's the law.

566
00:55:39,002 --> 00:55:39,922
Who's next?

567
00:56:45,110 --> 00:56:45,940
Who's next?

568
00:56:46,027 --> 00:56:47,027
No!

569
00:56:47,112 --> 00:56:48,322
Mowgli!

570
00:56:56,287 --> 00:56:57,117
No!

571
00:57:11,052 --> 00:57:13,932
If I ever see you here again,

572
00:57:13,957 --> 00:57:16,836
I will set your hide ablaze,

573
00:57:17,091 --> 00:57:19,255
and watch you burn alive!

574
00:57:20,831 --> 00:57:22,831
I will taste your blood,

575
00:57:23,356 --> 00:57:24,896
man-cub.

576
00:57:36,411 --> 00:57:37,371
Leave.

577
00:57:43,126 --> 00:57:43,956
What?

578
00:57:44,961 --> 00:57:45,921
You have...

579
00:57:47,005 --> 00:57:49,005
turned the weapons of man...

580
00:57:50,049 --> 00:57:51,129
upon us.

581
00:57:53,136 --> 00:57:55,926
You have brought
the pack great shame.

582
00:57:56,431 --> 00:57:57,851
You have brought me...

583
00:57:59,434 --> 00:58:00,524
great shame.

584
00:58:02,937 --> 00:58:03,897
Leave.

585
01:03:09,869 --> 01:03:10,749
Bagh...

586
01:03:19,879 --> 01:03:21,259
Hello, little brother.

587
01:03:24,509 --> 01:03:26,509
I knew you'd come.

588
01:03:28,346 --> 01:03:30,636
I knew you'd rescue me.

589
01:03:33,559 --> 01:03:34,389
Mowgli...

590
01:03:38,272 --> 01:03:40,112
I have not come to rescue you.

591
01:03:41,692 --> 01:03:43,492
I've come to tell you to stay.

592
01:03:45,905 --> 01:03:46,735
What?

593
01:03:55,373 --> 01:03:56,904
You must stay in the village.

594
01:03:56,929 --> 01:03:58,987
You must not come
back to the jungle.

595
01:03:59,043 --> 01:04:00,714
But the jungle is my home.

596
01:04:00,739 --> 01:04:02,537
No, it isn't. Not anymore.

597
01:04:02,588 --> 01:04:04,378
I can't stay here.

598
01:04:05,502 --> 01:04:06,502
Yes, you can.

599
01:04:06,526 --> 01:04:07,526
I can't.

600
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:10,100
You will learn
to understand their ways.

601
01:04:10,179 --> 01:04:11,259
You may even grow...

602
01:04:12,473 --> 01:04:13,473
to like it.

603
01:04:15,017 --> 01:04:16,057
It will be all right,

604
01:04:16,644 --> 01:04:17,564
little brother.

605
01:04:17,645 --> 01:04:18,473
How do you know?

606
01:04:18,498 --> 01:04:20,879
You've never spent a day
outside the jungle.

607
01:04:28,364 --> 01:04:29,954
I was born among man.

608
01:04:35,329 --> 01:04:37,619
I bear the marks of a collar.

609
01:04:39,125 --> 01:04:40,245
Under my chin.

610
01:04:44,755 --> 01:04:47,795
I lived in a king's palace
in a cage just like this.

611
01:04:48,593 --> 01:04:49,763
Fed through a slot.

612
01:04:51,637 --> 01:04:53,057
Man's entertainment.

613
01:04:55,933 --> 01:04:58,943
I only heard stories about the jungle.

614
01:05:02,398 --> 01:05:03,568
When I found you...

615
01:05:04,901 --> 01:05:06,361
all those seasons ago...

616
01:05:09,196 --> 01:05:10,866
I saw something in you.

617
01:05:12,491 --> 01:05:15,831
And I thought I could teach you.
I thought I could...

618
01:05:18,706 --> 01:05:20,206
teach you how to belong.

619
01:05:21,208 --> 01:05:23,338
To be like everyone else.

620
01:05:26,881 --> 01:05:28,511
But I was wrong, Mowgli.

621
01:05:29,133 --> 01:05:30,803
You weren't wrong.

622
01:05:35,139 --> 01:05:36,139
I was wrong.

623
01:05:38,893 --> 01:05:40,193
Bagheera!

624
01:05:42,104 --> 01:05:43,564
I love you.

625
01:05:55,826 --> 01:05:57,236
I was another panther...

626
01:05:58,037 --> 01:05:59,367
in that cage, Mowgli.

627
01:06:00,665 --> 01:06:01,575
I bit...

628
01:06:02,375 --> 01:06:03,785
and I scratched...

629
01:06:05,086 --> 01:06:08,046
and I spent my entire life fighting.

630
01:06:10,091 --> 01:06:11,051
Until one day...

631
01:06:12,468 --> 01:06:13,588
I just stopped.

632
01:06:17,974 --> 01:06:19,144
I stopped fighting.

633
01:06:22,311 --> 01:06:23,811
And I gained their trust.

634
01:06:25,189 --> 01:06:27,229
Gain their trust, little brother.

635
01:06:36,117 --> 01:06:37,577
Bagheera!

636
01:06:38,411 --> 01:06:41,041
Don't leave me here.

637
01:06:43,833 --> 01:06:45,843
Come back!

638
01:08:05,289 --> 01:08:06,249
Hey!

639
01:08:55,840 --> 01:08:57,170
You're a fast learner.

640
01:09:02,138 --> 01:09:03,428
Prefer mine cooked.

641
01:09:11,355 --> 01:09:12,895
I noticed your scar.

642
01:09:21,824 --> 01:09:22,664
Tiger.

643
01:09:26,579 --> 01:09:28,829
Looks like we've both got
the same enemy.

644
01:10:07,119 --> 01:10:09,289
It's nothing to worry about.

645
01:10:12,166 --> 01:10:13,666
It's all right, it's nothing.

646
01:10:51,914 --> 01:10:54,214
Here, you can keep this one.

647
01:12:52,117 --> 01:12:53,987
It's so, you can hunt.

648
01:13:01,251 --> 01:13:02,091
There.

649
01:13:56,676 --> 01:13:57,776
Hello, brother!

650
01:13:59,601 --> 01:14:00,731
Hello, Mowgli.

651
01:14:04,850 --> 01:14:06,150
You look different.

652
01:14:14,575 --> 01:14:15,655
Why are you here?

653
01:14:16,118 --> 01:14:17,238
It's Shere Khan.

654
01:14:18,203 --> 01:14:19,293
He's taken over.

655
01:14:20,205 --> 01:14:21,615
We've had to leave home.

656
01:14:21,707 --> 01:14:23,827
Those of us who still
stand by Akela, anyway.

657
01:14:23,917 --> 01:14:25,997
And, the others?

658
01:14:26,295 --> 01:14:27,566
They come in groups,

659
01:14:27,791 --> 01:14:28,779
in the night.

660
01:14:29,840 --> 01:14:30,840
Threaten us.

661
01:14:31,842 --> 01:14:32,972
Our own people.

662
01:14:35,679 --> 01:14:37,309
It's not my problem anymore.

663
01:14:37,389 --> 01:14:37,904
Mowgli.

664
01:14:37,929 --> 01:14:39,349
It's not my problem.

665
01:14:39,433 --> 01:14:41,853
We've been pushed to the very edge
of the jungle.

666
01:14:42,811 --> 01:14:44,981
And Khan won't stop killing man's cattle.

667
01:14:45,397 --> 01:14:46,227
Brother.

668
01:14:48,108 --> 01:14:50,278
We're afraid of what man
might do to us.

669
01:14:54,072 --> 01:14:55,822
The pack needs you, Mowgli.

670
01:14:57,910 --> 01:15:00,300
They didn't need me
when I was cast out.

671
01:15:06,919 --> 01:15:07,789
Please!

672
01:15:09,838 --> 01:15:10,708
Come home.

673
01:15:20,974 --> 01:15:22,414
This is my home now.

674
01:17:01,742 --> 01:17:02,782
Lockwood,

675
01:17:04,536 --> 01:17:08,616
when will you kill the tiger?
He has killed many cattle.

676
01:17:09,249 --> 01:17:10,379
A clever beast.

677
01:17:12,836 --> 01:17:14,586
Knows how to cover his tracks.

678
01:17:16,798 --> 01:17:20,298
Have you ever missed?

679
01:17:21,261 --> 01:17:22,351
Just once,

680
01:17:23,513 --> 01:17:24,433
just once.

681
01:17:27,017 --> 01:17:29,017
Tiger? Tiger?

682
01:17:31,688 --> 01:17:32,728
Elephant.

683
01:17:37,027 --> 01:17:39,277
I did get one of his tusks, though.

684
01:17:40,739 --> 01:17:43,129
I have never missed a kill since.

685
01:17:57,232 --> 01:17:59,232
I will get your tiger.

686
01:17:59,257 --> 01:18:01,467
I have no doubt, I will get him.

687
01:18:05,347 --> 01:18:06,307
I will get him.

688
01:20:04,466 --> 01:20:05,716
Beautiful...

689
01:20:06,802 --> 01:20:07,682
isn't he?

690
01:20:12,182 --> 01:20:13,812
My first albino.

691
01:20:18,396 --> 01:20:19,436
And this

692
01:20:19,981 --> 01:20:22,981
is my own personal menagerie.

693
01:20:29,783 --> 01:20:32,623
You don't understand

694
01:20:33,787 --> 01:20:35,997
a word I'm saying,

695
01:20:36,081 --> 01:20:36,921
do you?

696
01:20:43,713 --> 01:20:45,673
We can't all be scholars.

697
01:20:49,594 --> 01:20:51,604
Because God knows I'm not.

698
01:22:48,672 --> 01:22:51,342
I will show you the hunter
who took this...

699
01:22:53,259 --> 01:22:55,929
if you help me rid the jungle
of the tiger.

700
01:23:00,475 --> 01:23:03,305
Shere Khan has brought us
nothing but chaos.

701
01:23:11,486 --> 01:23:13,736
Akela, we must kill the tiger.

702
01:23:15,865 --> 01:23:17,615
I would rather die,

703
01:23:18,326 --> 01:23:20,826
than break with the laws of the jungle.

704
01:23:21,788 --> 01:23:22,788
And our people...

705
01:23:24,184 --> 01:23:25,484
your friends...

706
01:23:26,209 --> 01:23:27,169
are with me.

707
01:23:28,461 --> 01:23:31,011
But I'm not bound
by those laws anymore, Akela,

708
01:23:31,089 --> 01:23:33,509
and this is not the jungle
you once knew.

709
01:23:34,384 --> 01:23:35,764
When you were a cub,

710
01:23:35,844 --> 01:23:39,014
I looked you in the eye and saw no fear.

711
01:23:39,472 --> 01:23:41,197
I believed then,

712
01:23:41,422 --> 01:23:42,607
that one day,

713
01:23:42,708 --> 01:23:45,036
you would bring peace
to the jungle.

714
01:23:46,688 --> 01:23:49,168
But you have become a man now, Mowgli.

715
01:23:49,607 --> 01:23:50,777
I am not a man.

716
01:23:52,277 --> 01:23:53,837
But neither am I a wolf.

717
01:23:59,993 --> 01:24:01,361
Which of you will follow me?

718
01:24:01,385 --> 01:24:02,817
We can't, Mowgli.

719
01:24:05,040 --> 01:24:07,710
The jungle law, is sacred.

720
01:24:11,212 --> 01:24:12,212
Bagheera.

721
01:24:20,680 --> 01:24:22,640
Tomorrow, the tiger dies.

722
01:25:09,229 --> 01:25:10,309
Khan!

723
01:25:16,903 --> 01:25:19,613
Khan!

724
01:25:19,739 --> 01:25:21,199
The boy needs us, Akela.

725
01:25:25,495 --> 01:25:27,705
Here I am!

726
01:25:30,708 --> 01:25:33,088
Khan!

727
01:25:56,359 --> 01:25:58,319
Look at you,

728
01:25:58,403 --> 01:26:02,913
using a man's tool to do your killing.

729
01:26:05,451 --> 01:26:08,161
What would Baloo
and Bagheera think?

730
01:26:18,214 --> 01:26:20,094
What's he doing?

731
01:28:22,964 --> 01:28:24,224
There's your hunter!

732
01:28:39,605 --> 01:28:40,605
Let's go.

733
01:29:12,305 --> 01:29:14,305
You know, I can still hear

734
01:29:14,974 --> 01:29:16,644
your mother's screams

735
01:29:17,018 --> 01:29:20,188
the night I took her life.

736
01:30:35,221 --> 01:30:36,181
Akela!

737
01:30:41,936 --> 01:30:45,976
Forgive me for doubting you, Mowgli.

738
01:30:50,319 --> 01:30:51,949
It is your time now.

739
01:30:57,577 --> 01:30:58,827
Lead them.

740
01:33:45,578 --> 01:33:47,498
Sleep now, Shere Khan.

741
01:33:48,873 --> 01:33:50,253
Be angry no more.
