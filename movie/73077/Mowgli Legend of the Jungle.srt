-Where you going?
-To Akela.

00:06:01,903 --> 00:06:04,113
A council must be held

-[Vihaan] Keep him?
-[Nisha] Don't let him out of your sight.

91

-[female] That doesn't belong here. [male 2] A man-cub! Outrageous.

Well,

98
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:41,728
this is most unusual indeed.

99
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:43,742
Nisha,

100
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:46,490
you wish to raise this cub
as if he were your own?

101
00:06:47,281 --> 00:06:48,531
-I do.
-[wolves whine]

102
00:06:49,158 --> 00:06:49,988
And Vihaan? You, too?

103
00:06:53,204 --> 00:06:54,044
I do.

104
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:55,292
[male] It's a man-cub!

105
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:56,540
You know the law.

106
00:06:58,459 --> 00:07:00,169
This cub was not born among us.

107
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:04,297
So, who,<i> here,</i> speaks for the cub?

108
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:07,465
[Bagheera pants] I speak for the cub.

109
00:07:09,387 --> 00:07:12,347
The law states that the life of a cub...

110
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:14,019
may be bought...

111
00:07:14,475 --> 00:07:15,475
for a price.

112
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:18,193
I brought my payment.

113
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:19,651
We have one.

114
00:07:20,356 --> 00:07:21,186
[barking]

115
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:23,114
Who else will speak for the cub?

116
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:25,237
Baloo does.

117
00:07:25,528 --> 00:07:26,818
[male wolf] Baloo?

118
00:07:27,196 --> 00:07:30,026
-Bagheera...
-He's not a wolf. He has no say.

119
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:32,656
He's the teacher of your cubs.
That makes him a member of the pack.

120
00:07:33,661 --> 00:07:36,541
I ain't speakin' for no... [snickers]

121
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:37,963
...a man-cub.

122
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:42,586
Bagheera, have you lost your mind?
A man-cub living in the jungle?

123
00:07:48,926 --> 00:07:50,926
[sniffs]

124
00:07:58,603 --> 00:07:59,603
[Nisha] Akela,

125
00:07:59,687 --> 00:08:01,437
his parents will come.

126
00:08:01,522 --> 00:08:02,822
[loud roaring]

127
00:08:03,024 --> 00:08:07,284
[Shere Khan] His parents are dead.

128
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:10,026
I killed them.

129
00:08:10,114 --> 00:08:11,414
[Tabaqui laughs]

130
00:08:11,532 --> 00:08:15,412
There is no one to come looking for him.

131
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:17,408
[wolves growl]

132
00:08:17,538 --> 00:08:19,748
This is not your concern, Shere Khan.

133
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:21,382
The cub is mine.

134
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:24,209
I already tasted its mother's blood.

135
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:27,795
It is my right.

136
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:29,972
Your right according to who's law?

137
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:31,261
Best you leave now.

138
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:34,974
Careful, Akela.

139
00:08:35,431 --> 00:08:38,181
You do not want to challenge me.

140
00:08:38,267 --> 00:08:39,937
[Tabaqui laughs]

141
00:08:40,061 --> 00:08:41,061
This cub...

142
00:08:42,104 --> 00:08:44,234
is under the protection of the pack.

143
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:47,187
Should you decide to take me,

144
00:08:47,818 --> 00:08:50,068
you take on the pack.

145
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:52,239
All of us.

146
00:08:52,323 --> 00:08:55,033
[wolves snarl and bark]

147
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:57,580
As long as I am leader,

148
00:08:58,287 --> 00:09:00,917
this part of the jungle is closed to you.

149
00:09:00,998 --> 00:09:03,998
-[snarling and barking]
-[Baloo and Bagheera roar]

150
00:09:04,335 --> 00:09:07,955
You cannot be leader forever.

151
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:10,718
The day you miss your kill,

152
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:14,514
the man-cub's blood...

153
00:09:14,845 --> 00:09:18,805
will run down my chin.

154
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:21,225
[wolves growl]

155
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:32,363
[Akela] The cub is spoken for.

156
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:34,068
He is one of us.

157
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:36,664
You will teach him as you would your own.

158
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:38,907
As long as I am alive,

159
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:41,712
the pack will stand by the man-cub.

160
00:09:42,164 --> 00:09:43,084

Whoa!

[leaves rustle]

[Mowgli whooping and laughing]

168
00:10:51,442 --> 00:10:54,862
[Bagheera]
Hunting is sacred, little brother.

169
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:57,740
It is our right.

170
00:10:59,408 --> 00:11:02,908
But we never do it for sport.

171
00:11:03,788 --> 00:11:06,498
Shh...

172
00:11:09,877 --> 00:11:11,587
[snarling]

173
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:22,430
[panting] Wait. Wait.

174
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,440
We look them in the eye...

175
00:11:27,603 --> 00:11:28,943
so that the soul...

176
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:31,265
doesn't depart, alone.

-[Bagheera grunts softly]
-[crunching insect] [birds caw]

180
00:12:19,864 --> 00:12:21,744
How old is the jungle, Bagheera?

181
00:12:22,491 --> 00:12:25,411
The jungle has been here
since before you were born

182
00:12:25,494 --> 00:12:27,294
and it will be here...

183
00:12:29,206 --> 00:12:30,366
[yawning]

184
00:12:30,499 --> 00:12:31,999
...after you die.

185
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:34,841
The jungle is eternal.

186
00:12:35,629 --> 00:12:36,799
[Mowgli] Bagheera...

187
00:12:38,507 --> 00:12:42,427
why am I different to the other wolves?

188
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:51,768
You are no different,

189
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:53,645
little brother.

190
00:12:55,316 --> 00:12:57,436
You are special.

191
00:12:58,402 --> 00:13:00,862
[Baloo] <i>Of course you're different.</i>
[sniffs]

192
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,280
That's why you need special training.

193
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:05,623
You know what your trouble is?

194
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:07,452
Lack of focus.

195
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:08,950
[Mowgli] Baloo,

196
00:13:09,413 --> 00:13:11,463
how many ants can you fit in your mouth?

197
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:13,377
Ants are really small

198
00:13:13,834 --> 00:13:15,844
and your mouth is really big.

199
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:19,424
-I bet--
-Mowgli, will you concentrate?

200
00:13:24,595 --> 00:13:26,255
[scorpion hissing and snapping]

201
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:27,260
Do... not...

202
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:31,476
move.

203
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:38,863
Why do I have to do this?

204
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:39,903
'Cause I said so.

205
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:41,695
Tell me the three laws, now.

206
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:43,569
"No wolf shall have contact with man."

207
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:45,116
-Next.
-Baloo...

208
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:48,328
-what happened to your tail?
-Next!

209
00:13:48,577 --> 00:13:50,657
"No wolf shall hunt man's animals.

210
00:13:51,288 --> 00:13:53,998
Above all, the cow, which is sacred!"

211
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:57,546
Did it fall off?
Is that why you don't have one?

212
00:13:57,628 --> 00:13:59,548
What? Why haven't you got a tail?

213
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:02,260
I don't know.
I never really thought about it.

214
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:03,511
Third law.

215
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:04,641
Now!

216
00:14:04,718 --> 00:14:08,258
"No wolf shall kill man in the jungle,
for killing man only brings danger."

217
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:10,347
Oh, well. Least you know your laws.

218
00:14:10,432 --> 00:14:13,522
Now, we just got to get you
to run as fast as the other wolves.

219
00:14:15,104 --> 00:14:18,364
-[Baloo chuckles] Oy!
-[Mowgli grunts and groans]

220
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:21,486
Don't let your guard down. [laughs]

221
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:24,201
All right,
that's enough for today, Mowgli.

222
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,320
[Mowgli howling]

223
00:14:25,406 --> 00:14:29,196
Straight back to the caves.
No wandering. Run like a wolf, d'you hear?

224
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:32,120
[Mowgli] I can't hear you!

225
00:14:32,204 --> 00:14:35,124
[Baloo chuckles and sighs]

226
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:48,552
[sniffs] [birds tweeting]

227
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:02,065
[cows mooing]

228
00:15:02,359 --> 00:15:04,359
[bells jingling] [indistinct chattering]

229
00:15:11,952 --> 00:15:13,002
[Bhoot] Mowgli!

230
00:15:13,829 --> 00:15:14,909
Hey, Mowgli. [pants]

231
00:15:15,706 --> 00:15:17,626
-Bhoot!
-What are you doing?

232
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:20,093
-Nothing.
-Hey, do you want to play?

233
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:23,169
-[Mowgli] Got ya!
-[Bhoot screams] -[laughs]
-Oh!

234
00:15:26,133 --> 00:15:28,053
Oh, I nearly had you.

235
00:15:29,845 --> 00:15:30,965
You're good at hiding.

236
00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:34,765
Mum taught me how to hide.
She shows me loads of tricks.

237
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:37,770
[laughs] So I can protect myself.

238
00:15:37,853 --> 00:15:40,523
She says, "Others can mistake...

239
00:15:40,731 --> 00:15:42,821
individuality for weakness."

240
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:45,492
That's why they have a go at me sometimes.

241
00:15:47,112 --> 00:15:47,952
Yeah.

242
00:15:48,697 --> 00:15:49,527
Me, too.

243
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:51,992
Come on. I'll race you home.

244
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:55,120
-[Bhoot chuckles]
-On my call...

245
00:15:56,163 --> 00:15:57,043
Go!

246
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:00,876
[Mowgli howls]

247
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:03,383
[both laughing]

248
00:16:07,841 --> 00:16:09,841
[howling]

249
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:12,143
Hey.

250
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:14,641
Hey, brother.

251
00:16:15,891 --> 00:16:17,641
What did Baloo make you do today?

252
00:16:17,726 --> 00:16:19,806
Put a scorpion on me
and told me not to move.

253
00:16:19,895 --> 00:16:21,935
-[laughs]
-[Mowgli] He says I lack focus.

254
00:16:22,022 --> 00:16:24,152
[brother]
Aw, Baloo says that to all of us.

255
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:26,817
-How was your lesson?
-Fine.

256
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:28,696
Your brother tells me
you're getting faster.

257
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:30,699
He can nearly keep pace with me.

258
00:16:30,781 --> 00:16:32,241
He can almost beat Bhoot. [laughs]

259
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:35,204
Yeah, he should just race
with his freak friend!

260
00:16:35,285 --> 00:16:37,745
It's only natural they spend
so much time with each other.

261
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:39,370
Freaks have to stick together.

262
00:16:39,456 --> 00:16:41,456
-[wolves growl]
-[Bhoot gasps and grunts]

263
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:43,882
[Nisha] That's enough.

264
00:16:44,795 --> 00:16:45,795
Ow. That really hurt.

265
00:16:45,879 --> 00:16:46,799
Inside, now.

266
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:47,840
[wolves whine]

267
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:48,795
Thanks.

268
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:51,641
You shouldn't let them pick on you
like that.

269
00:16:52,386 --> 00:16:53,796
We were only playing.

270
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:55,143
Better go home, Bhoot.

271
00:16:55,806 --> 00:16:57,176
Bye, Mowgli! [chuckles] Ow.

272
00:16:57,266 --> 00:17:00,016
I meant what I said to Mum.
You are getting faster.

273
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:01,852
Your father was never
much of a runner either.

274
00:17:02,229 --> 00:17:04,769
It's true. I was the slowest in my group.

275
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:07,897
I never thought I was gonna complete
The Running. I was sure I would fail.

276
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:11,610
-You're going to be late.
-Have a good hunt, Father.

277
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:15,027
Before you know it, you'll be coming along
with me. All of you!

278
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:19,659
-[male wolf] Good hunting!
-[Vihaan] Good hunting all!

279
00:17:19,747 --> 00:17:21,747
[howling]

280
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:31,590
[Baloo] This is the jungle!

281
00:17:32,801 --> 00:17:35,261
In the jungle, we all hunt.

282
00:17:35,345 --> 00:17:36,675
And... [snarls]

283
00:17:36,764 --> 00:17:39,394
...we are all hunted.

284
00:17:39,683 --> 00:17:41,023
You see what that means.

285
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:43,230
It means that you...

286
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:45,311
you don't want to get caught.

287
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:47,397
[wolves growl and bark]

288
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:50,693
That's why you can't join the pack...

289
00:17:51,278 --> 00:17:54,528
until you have passed The Running--
[shouts] Pay attention!

290
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:56,615
[whines]

291
00:18:01,163 --> 00:18:02,623
"What's The Running, Baloo?"

292
00:18:03,874 --> 00:18:06,924
The running is the hunt where you...

293
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:09,208
are the prey.

294
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:11,421
[wolves and Mowgli whine]

295
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:13,054
Now, Bagheera here...

296
00:18:13,133 --> 00:18:14,933
You all know Bagheera, don't you?

297
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:16,720
Yeah, Bagheera, friendly Bagheera.

298
00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:20,429
In The Running, Bagheera will hunt you,

299
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:21,926
and if he catches you...

300
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:23,733
you fail.

301
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:26,563
What happens if you fail? [yelling] You don't join the pack!

302
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:30,690
-[wolves whine]
-[Mowgli whimpers]

303
00:18:33,987 --> 00:18:36,367
But I've never had one of my cubs fail.

304
00:18:36,698 --> 00:18:37,658
[sniffs]

305
00:18:39,034 --> 00:18:42,204
And I'm not gonna start now. [laughs]

306
00:18:43,163 --> 00:18:44,923
[Mowgli gasps]

307
00:18:44,998 --> 00:18:45,828
Good.

308
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:47,708
Let's practice, shall we?

309
00:18:52,673 --> 00:18:53,673
[Baloo] On my call.

310
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:57,473
Wait... wait...

311
00:18:59,263 --> 00:19:00,263
Go!

312
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:02,807
[Baloo] Come on, now!

313
00:19:04,893 --> 00:19:06,023
Pick up the pace!

314
00:19:09,857 --> 00:19:11,277
Come on!

315
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:14,485
Faster!

316
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:17,487
[Mowgli panting]

317
00:19:24,913 --> 00:19:27,333
[Baloo breathing heavily]

318
00:19:36,758 --> 00:19:38,758
[monkey chittering]

319
00:19:48,645 --> 00:19:51,435
[monkey chatters]

320
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:13,671
[grunts]

321
00:20:13,754 --> 00:20:15,714
You were with the monkey-people...

322
00:20:16,089 --> 00:20:19,009
again. [breathes heavily]

323
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:20,138
[laughs]

324
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:22,552
[Baloo] The monkey-people have no law,

325
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:24,597
they're unpredictable,

326
00:20:24,681 --> 00:20:26,481
and they can't even speak proper.

327
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:30,562
-[Mowgli] I think they're funny.
-[Baloo] There's nothing funny about them.

328
00:20:30,646 --> 00:20:32,306
You keep away, do you understand?

329
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:36,187
-I'm not afraid of them.
-Only fools feel no fear, Mowgli.

330
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:39,030
[Baloo]
The monkey-people are especially foolish.

331
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:40,989
There's nothing they're afraid of.

332
00:20:41,615 --> 00:20:44,275
Well, except Kaa. [laughs]

333
00:20:44,618 --> 00:20:46,698
Oh, they can't even lay eyes on her.

334
00:20:46,787 --> 00:20:47,747
[Mowgli] Who's Kaa?

335
00:20:47,871 --> 00:20:50,871
-Oh, you don't want to meet Kaa.
-[Mowgli chuckles]

336
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:53,133
Kaa the Python...

337
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:55,250
is as old as the jungle.

338
00:20:56,797 --> 00:20:58,757
She sees the past...

339
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:00,764
and the future.

340
00:21:00,842 --> 00:21:02,842
[flies buzzing]

341
00:21:03,303 --> 00:21:05,853
-[Mowgli pants]
-[shouts] Turn around!

342
00:21:09,977 --> 00:21:10,807
Eyes forward.

343
00:21:11,019 --> 00:21:13,019
[flies buzzing]

344
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:18,686
The cow...

345
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:21,284
had been killed
and left there to be found.

346
00:21:21,738 --> 00:21:27,578
-[male 1] The tiger! He's come back!
-Only Khan would kill man's cattle.

347
00:21:27,661 --> 00:21:30,501
-[male 2] One man-cub will bring more men!
-It's Shere Khan!

348
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:32,920
Akela, we knew this would happen!
We told you!

349
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,340
Can't you see, Akela,
the man-cub is putting us all in danger.

350
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:40,590
-You were wrong to ever take him in!
-We should give him to the tiger!

351
00:21:40,674 --> 00:21:42,594
-Akela, no!
-[male wolf] Save the pack!

352
00:21:43,051 --> 00:21:43,891
Please.

353
00:21:45,804 --> 00:21:47,064
He is one of us.

354
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:51,769
I will see to this matter.

355
00:21:52,561 --> 00:21:53,401
Go!

356
00:21:54,187 --> 00:21:56,187
[howling]

357
00:22:05,073 --> 00:22:07,583
Shere Khan wants to bring war
to the jungle.

358
00:22:08,702 --> 00:22:09,542
War?

359
00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:12,962
With man? Is he out of his mind?

360
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:13,870
War with me.

361
00:22:15,959 --> 00:22:17,289
He knows I'm getting old.

362
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:20,339
This is his way of bringing chaos
to the pack.

363
00:22:21,214 --> 00:22:24,014
-Khan wants the boy.
-We can protect him.

364
00:22:24,092 --> 00:22:26,972
You know there is only one way
to protect him.

365
00:22:27,512 --> 00:22:29,432
He must go to the man village.

366
00:22:30,057 --> 00:22:31,477
You're forgetting, Bagheera,

367
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:34,727
this was always more
than just a good deed.

368
00:22:35,479 --> 00:22:36,939
The jungle is changing.

369
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:41,443
Man is taking more of it,
as each season passes.

370
00:22:42,736 --> 00:22:43,606
And the boy...

371
00:22:44,446 --> 00:22:47,696
may just be our only hope of survival.

372
00:22:48,492 --> 00:22:50,872
The jungle is no longer safe for him.

373
00:22:51,828 --> 00:22:55,168
-The pack won't accept him.
-They will if he passes The Running.

374
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:57,134
Baloo, is he ready?

375
00:22:57,209 --> 00:22:59,629
Of course he's not ready.
He's not a wolf.

376
00:22:59,711 --> 00:23:01,001
Then make him ready.

377
00:23:02,923 --> 00:23:04,933
[Baloo sighs]

378
00:23:06,968 --> 00:23:08,008
[Baloo] Right,

379
00:23:08,095 --> 00:23:09,385
no more messing about.

380
00:23:10,305 --> 00:23:11,965
Can you run as fast as a wolf?

381
00:23:12,641 --> 00:23:13,731
No, you can't.

382
00:23:14,518 --> 00:23:17,518
You've got hands with fingers on the ends,

383
00:23:17,604 --> 00:23:18,614
so let's use them.

384
00:23:18,688 --> 00:23:19,518
What?

385
00:23:20,315 --> 00:23:22,395
Now jump, to there.

386
00:23:23,318 --> 00:23:24,438
Come on, hurry up.

387
00:23:24,569 --> 00:23:26,239
[Mowgli pants]

388
00:23:27,656 --> 00:23:29,406
[grunts, thuds]

389
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:30,950
[Baloo laughs]

00:23:31,034 --> 00:23:32,454
[birds fluttering and chirping]

391
00:23:32,536 --> 00:23:33,406
Again.

392
00:23:33,662 --> 00:23:35,372
[grunts, thuds]

393
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:36,920
[Baloo] Oh, nearly!

394
00:23:41,044 --> 00:23:41,924
[grunting]

395
00:23:42,921 --> 00:23:45,421
Ah! [yelling]

396
00:23:45,507 --> 00:23:46,797
-Yes!
-Baloo!

397
00:23:46,883 --> 00:23:48,893
[laughing]

398
00:23:49,886 --> 00:23:51,006
[Mowgli grunts, thuds]

00:24:58,371 --> 00:25:00,871
[Shere Khan growls]

406
00:25:12,093 --> 00:25:13,473
[shouts] Ah!

407
00:25:17,015 --> 00:25:18,725
[roaring]

408
00:25:23,897 --> 00:25:25,517
[panting]

409
00:25:26,399 --> 00:25:27,229
Ah!

410
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:30,453
[grunting]

411
00:25:32,239 --> 00:25:33,739

[Bagheera snarls]

422
00:26:58,116 --> 00:26:59,076
What happened?

423
00:27:02,537 --> 00:27:05,167
[Bagheera panting]

424
00:27:10,295 --> 00:27:12,295
[trumpeting] [birds tweeting]

425
00:27:24,768 --> 00:27:26,098
Come on, little brother.

426
00:27:26,645 --> 00:27:27,595
Time to go home.

427
00:27:33,276 --> 00:27:35,276
[growls softly] [indistinct human chatter]

428
00:27:51,086 --> 00:27:53,126
[Bagheera]
Do you know why those men have come?

429
00:27:53,213 --> 00:27:55,223
[bells dinging]

430
00:27:56,424 --> 00:27:59,764
[Bagheera] They've come to hunt the tiger
that steals their cattle.

431
00:28:00,136 --> 00:28:01,216
Will they kill him?

432
00:28:01,304 --> 00:28:02,264
It won't be easy.

433
00:28:03,682 --> 00:28:05,022
Shere Khan...

434
00:28:05,517 --> 00:28:06,427
is clever.

435
00:28:08,061 --> 00:28:09,191
Very dangerous.

436
00:28:12,774 --> 00:28:13,734
Mowgli...

437
00:28:15,318 --> 00:28:17,198
the jungle is no longer safe for you.

438
00:28:19,114 --> 00:28:23,084
But if you were to be in a place
where Shere Khan would never go,

439
00:28:23,827 --> 00:28:25,197
then you would be safe.

440
00:28:26,329 --> 00:28:27,959
Where does Shere Khan never go?

441
00:28:29,124 --> 00:28:30,254
Mmm...

442
00:28:30,417 --> 00:28:32,667
you know... the man village.

443
00:28:33,169 --> 00:28:34,499
Why would I go there?

444
00:28:39,676 --> 00:28:41,586
Because you are a man-cub.

445
00:28:44,764 --> 00:28:47,024
I have seen the way
you look at the village.

446
00:28:47,308 --> 00:28:48,688
[Mowgli whimpers]

447
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:50,560
You are one of them.

448
00:28:52,021 --> 00:28:53,111
I'm a wolf.

449
00:28:53,189 --> 00:28:54,229
Mowgli...

450
00:28:54,649 --> 00:28:56,739
[Bagheera sighs]

451
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:01,744
He wants your blood, little brother.

452
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:04,910
It was Shere Khan
who killed your man-parents

453
00:29:04,993 --> 00:29:06,663
all those seasons ago,

454
00:29:07,287 --> 00:29:09,707
and now he wants to kill you.

455
00:29:11,416 --> 00:29:12,666
The pack will protect me.

456
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:14,291
If you fail The Running...

457
00:29:14,377 --> 00:29:15,247
I won't fail.

458
00:29:15,336 --> 00:29:16,296
You won't...

459
00:29:17,213 --> 00:29:18,673
be able to join the pack.

460
00:29:19,048 --> 00:29:20,628
[shouts] I won't fail!

461
00:29:22,385 --> 00:29:23,755
Then promise me this.

462
00:29:25,472 --> 00:29:26,722
If you do fail...

463
00:29:28,016 --> 00:29:29,426
you will go to the village.

464
00:29:30,935 --> 00:29:32,185
Promise me, Mowgli.

465
00:29:43,907 --> 00:29:45,907
[Mowgli pants] [indistinct human chatter]

466
00:29:57,545 --> 00:29:59,755
-[woman groans]
-[man] Good evening!

467
00:29:59,923 --> 00:30:01,933

00:30:16,689 --> 00:30:18,689
[fire crackling]

469
00:30:23,029 --> 00:30:25,409
[Lockwood] Don't worry.
I'll kill your tiger.

470
00:30:25,573 --> 00:30:27,123
How many's he taken this time?

471
00:30:28,201 --> 00:30:29,041
Careful!

472
00:30:29,536 --> 00:30:30,746
Quickly, now. Come on.

473
00:30:30,954 --> 00:30:34,464

[snarls]

480
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:12,872
Did you smell the blood, man-cub?

481
00:31:14,163 --> 00:31:15,293
[whispers] What is it?

482
00:31:19,168 --> 00:31:23,088
-The creature that did that to your tail.
-[Tabaqui] It's called "fire."

483
00:31:24,007 --> 00:31:25,627
It's hotter than the sun.

484
00:31:26,968 --> 00:31:28,758
And it's quicker than the panther.

485
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:33,222
Your kind use dark magic, man-cub.

486
00:31:33,308 --> 00:31:34,848
They're not my kind.

487
00:31:34,934 --> 00:31:36,944
[laughs]

488
00:31:41,524 --> 00:31:42,404
Sometimes...

489
00:31:43,484 --> 00:31:46,284
I dream I'm a tiger. [growls]

490
00:31:47,113 --> 00:31:49,163
But I always wake up a hyena.

491
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:53,871
[laughs]

492
00:31:53,953 --> 00:31:56,583
[groans] Ow.

493
00:31:58,917 --> 00:31:59,877
Ooh.

494
00:32:00,418 --> 00:32:02,418
[birds tweeting] [elephant trumpets]

495
00:32:12,388 --> 00:32:14,388
You should try and get some sleep.

496
00:32:19,729 --> 00:32:21,649
You'll want to be rested for tomorrow.

497
00:32:31,491 --> 00:32:32,991
What's bothering you, my love?

498
00:32:34,827 --> 00:32:36,537
All I've ever wanted...

499
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:40,377
my whole life...

500
00:32:42,377 --> 00:32:43,707
is to be a wolf.

501
00:32:47,882 --> 00:32:50,182
For the others to see me as an...

502
00:32:52,345 --> 00:32:53,175
equal.

503
00:32:56,474 --> 00:32:58,944
This is my chance to prove myself.

504
00:33:00,269 --> 00:33:02,109
To prove that I'm one of them.

505
00:33:04,023 --> 00:33:05,403
To prove that I belong.

506
00:33:05,483 --> 00:33:06,483
You belong.

507
00:33:10,363 --> 00:33:11,863
You belong, Mowgli.

508
00:33:14,492 --> 00:33:17,792
Don't, ever, let anyone
make you think otherwise.

509
00:33:21,207 --> 00:33:23,667
You will always be my son, Mowgli.

510
00:33:26,212 --> 00:33:28,132
Nothing can ever change that.

511
00:33:59,203 --> 00:34:01,083
[Akela] You are about to take part

512
00:34:01,289 --> 00:34:03,249
in one of our oldest traditions.

513

The Running of the Pack.

514
00:34:07,628 --> 00:34:09,458
Those of you who pass the test...

515
00:34:10,965 --> 00:34:12,335
will have earned the right...

516
00:34:13,301 --> 00:34:14,261
to join us...

517
00:34:14,844 --> 00:34:15,934
in the night hunt.

518
00:34:19,307 --> 00:34:20,677
As is customary...

519
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:24,600
Bagheera will perform his task as chaser.

520
00:34:24,687 --> 00:34:26,687
[heart beating]

521
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:29,030

Face the hill.

525
00:34:48,711 --> 00:34:49,801
Good luck, brother.

526
00:34:49,879 --> 00:34:54,179
[Akela] I must warn you.
Bagheera has been told not to hold back.

[Akela] On my call.

530
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:07,978
Go!

we have each other.

We're not the same.

707

Don't you get it?

We'll never be one of them!
We're freaks!

You're not special, Bhoot!

713
00:49:07,110 --> 00:49:10,860
It's just something your mother tells you
to make you feel better about yourself...

714
00:49:10,948 --> 00:49:13,488

his destiny still uncertain.

727
00:50:59,264 --> 00:51:02,314
Are you afraid of me, man-cub?

No.

Why do you think
the elephant saved you from the tiger pit?

Why?

that you are something
the jungle has never seen before.

You're the reason man is here!
