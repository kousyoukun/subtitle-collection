1
01:10:07.119 --> 01:10:09.289
It's nothing to worry about.

2
01:10:12.166 --> 01:10:13.666
It's all right, it's nothing.

3
01:17:01.742 --> 01:17:02.782
Lockwood,

4
01:17:04.536 --> 01:17:08.616
when will you kill the tiger?
He has killed many cattle.

5
01:17:09.249 --> 01:17:10.379
A clever beast.

6
01:17:12.836 --> 01:17:14.586
Knows how to cover his tracks.

7
01:17:16.798 --> 01:17:20.298
Have you ever missed?

8
01:17:21.261 --> 01:17:22.351
Just once,

9
01:17:23.513 --> 01:17:24.433
just once.

10
01:17:27.170 --> 01:17:29.170
Tiger?

11
01:17:31.688 --> 01:17:32.728
Elephant.

12
01:17:37.270 --> 01:17:39.277
I did get one of his tusks, though.

13
01:17:40.739 --> 01:17:43.129
I have never missed a kill since.

14
01:17:57.232 --> 01:17:59.232
I will get your tiger.

15
01:17:59.257 --> 01:18:01.467
I have no doubt, I will get him.

16
01:18:05.347 --> 01:18:06.307
I will get him.
