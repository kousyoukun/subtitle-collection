00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:18,589
The Ring of the Fisherman,
which bears the official papal seal.

3
00:02:18,589 --> 00:02:22,900
Must be destroyed immediately
following the Pope's death.

4
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:27,639
The papal apartment is then sealed for
9 days of mourning,

5
00:02:27,639 --> 00:02:30,439
A period known as sede vacante:

6
00:02:30,439 --> 00:02:33,320
The time of the empty throne.

7
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:36,989
Over the last several days,

8
00:02:36,989 --> 00:02:40,159
Catholic leaders from every
corner of the world,

9
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:44,380
Have flocked to Rome,
shocked by the sudden death.....

10
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:47,590
.....of this progressive and beloved Pope.

11
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:56,669
Today, in St. Peter's Square,

12
00:02:56,669 --> 00:02:59,259
The faithful pray that there
is among them...

13
00:02:59,259 --> 00:03:01,969
...another leader who can unite
their Church...

14
00:03:01,969 --> 00:03:06,230
...which has been so riven by change
and dissent in recent years.

15
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:13,019
As the body of the pontiff passes by,

16
00:03:13,019 --> 00:03:16,479
We see prayers are being offered
by the preferiti,

17
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:18,859
Favorites among those being considered.

18
00:03:18,859 --> 00:03:23,080
To succeed him as the Vicar of Christ.

19
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,339
At the end of the mourning period,
the College of Cardinals.

20
00:03:35,339 --> 00:03:39,269
Will lock itself behind the doors
of the Sistine Chapel...

21
00:03:39,269 --> 00:03:43,000
...for conclave. The process
by which they will choose......

22
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,179
......a new leader for the world's
one billion Catholics...

23
00:03:46,179 --> 00:03:49,139
...who now find their church
at a crossroads...

24
00:03:49,139 --> 00:03:53,360
...its ancient traditions threatened
by a modern world.

25
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:05,080
Attention, control group going
online for LHC beam event.

26
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:07,460
We are powering up.

27
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:13,419
Attention, Category One personnel:

28
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:17,140
...interlock areas are now restricted.

29
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:20,509
You pulled us off the power grid, Philippe.

30
00:04:20,509 --> 00:04:23,299
Because you're scaring the
hell out of everyone.

31
00:04:23,299 --> 00:04:27,049
The collider was never intended
to generate antimatter.

32
00:04:27,049 --> 00:04:30,599
All three canisters are stored
under every possible safeguard.

33
00:04:30,599 --> 00:04:33,400
I'm only asking you to wait.

34
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:37,649
We can't wait. The bulk of the
antimatter is generated at start-up.

35
00:04:37,649 --> 00:04:39,280
Put us back online.

36
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:42,989
Do you want to call the director,
or shall I?

37
00:04:42,989 --> 00:04:46,779
ATLAS underground is now in restricted mode.

38
00:04:46,779 --> 00:04:48,369
Vittoria, Vittoria.

39
00:04:48,369 --> 00:04:50,329
Protons are being loaded.

40
00:04:50,329 --> 00:04:53,039
Don't blow us all to heaven.

41
00:04:53,039 --> 00:04:54,369
Please.

00:05:02,379 --> 00:05:04,259
We are powering up. Here we go.

45
00:05:04,259 --> 00:05:06,299
Start the collision sequence.

46
00:05:06,299 --> 00:05:09,440
Vittoria, what did Philippe want?

47
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:14,030
They're terrified. He wants us to wait.
What do you think?

48
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:19,399
I think if we don't harvest now,
we never will.

49
00:05:19,399 --> 00:05:22,149
Beam-on-beam stability is good.
Take your places, people.

50
00:05:22,149 --> 00:05:24,189
ATLAS at CMS, check.

51
00:05:24,189 --> 00:05:28,330
Sending timing trigger now.
Collisions imminent.

52
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:31,880
We have got 10 to the 13th
protons per bunch.

53
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:35,409
Let's hope the heavy ion
guys didn't mess up.

54
00:05:35,409 --> 00:05:38,720
Beams at relativistic velocities.

Luminosity monitors operational.

56
00:05:42,209 --> 00:05:44,589
Beamline has no restrictions.

57
00:05:44,589 --> 00:05:46,549
Enable beam capture.

58
00:05:46,549 --> 00:05:48,929
Accelerating the beam.

59
00:05:48,929 --> 00:05:50,929
Stage one, line up.

60
00:05:50,929 --> 00:05:52,719
Magnets to full field.

61
00:05:52,719 --> 00:05:54,519
Load functions to magnets.

62
00:05:54,519 --> 00:05:56,599
Last P is still too high.

63
00:05:56,599 --> 00:05:59,990
Yeah, we got luminosity of 10 to 34.

64
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:02,870
Inject particle beams.

65
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:05,740
Filling the LHC.

66
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:10,159
Collisions are active.
We should be back online.

67
00:06:10,159 --> 00:06:13,119
Capture should begin at any moment.

68
00:06:13,119 --> 00:06:15,880
Particles in transition.

69
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:22,289
Collisions are fixed and running.

70
00:06:22,289 --> 00:06:25,850
LHC injecting protons, beam one.

71
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:29,969
Lock the feedback systems.

Particles at 99 percent the speed of light.

73

Colliding stable beams.

Enact injection kicker.

75
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:44,019
We have a signal on the luminosity monitors.

76
00:06:44,019 --> 00:06:46,450
We have events.

77
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:53,830
Protons are moving.

78
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:16,440
We have antimatter.

79
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:23,990
It's on a scale never seen before.

80
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:27,080
That's a crate of beer on the way.

81
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:34,460
Silvano, we've done it.

82
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:43,840
We're in God's hands now, Vittoria.

83
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:46,800
I'll be right down.

84
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:47,570
Silvano.

85
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,910
Silvano.

86
00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:13,250
Oh, God.

87
00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:20,180
Help.
[VITTORIA YELLING IN ITALIAN]

A swim might help your jet lag.

89
00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:23,029
I beg your pardon?

90
00:10:23,029 --> 00:10:26,159
You got bags under your eyes.
It's 5 in the morning.

91
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:28,250
And you're from the Vatican.

92
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:31,590
Crossed keys under the triregnum.

93
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,090
It's a papal symbol.

94

Claudio Vincenzi,
Corpo della Gendarmeria Vaticano.

95
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:43,310
Vatican police?

96
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,690
I was expecting another letter.

97
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:51,940
My request for access to your archives.

98
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:54,139
Shouldn't you be in Rome?

99
00:10:54,139 --> 00:10:56,359
A kind of busy time for you guys, isn't it?

100
00:10:56,359 --> 00:10:59,849
In fact, I was in New York,
detailed to the U.N.

101
00:10:59,849 --> 00:11:02,200
I receive a phone call in the
middle of the night:

102
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:04,739
"Find Professor Robert Langdon.

103
00:11:04,739 --> 00:11:07,589
A matter of great urgency. "

104
00:11:07,589 --> 00:11:11,980
They said to show you this.

105
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:27,109
The illuminati? They disappeared
hundreds of years ago.

106
00:11:27,109 --> 00:11:28,949
Did they? Look at that again.

107
00:11:28,949 --> 00:11:30,199
It's an ambigram.

108
00:11:30,199 --> 00:11:32,449
It's the same image forward and backward.

109
00:11:32,449 --> 00:11:35,789
Now, that's common for a symbol,
like a yin and yang or a swastika.

110
00:11:35,789 --> 00:11:37,209
But that's a word.

111
00:11:37,209 --> 00:11:39,289
That illuminati ambigramatic symbol.

112
00:11:39,289 --> 00:11:42,289
Has been considered a myth for 400 years.

113
00:11:42,289 --> 00:11:44,089
Supposedly, in the 16th century.

114
00:11:44,089 --> 00:11:48,259
Some artist created it as a tribute
to Galileo's love of symmetry.

115
00:11:48,259 --> 00:11:49,879
It was only gonna be revealed.

116
00:11:49,879 --> 00:11:52,299
When the illuminati had amassed
enough power.

117
00:11:52,299 --> 00:11:54,679
To resurface and carry out their final goal.

118
00:11:54,679 --> 00:11:56,230
I wrote a book about it.

119
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:58,689
Which is why you're here.

120
00:11:58,689 --> 00:12:00,979
The Art of the illuminati by Robert Langdon.

00:12:02,479 --> 00:12:05,609
Haven't been able to finish Part Two.
because I'm not allowed access...

123
00:12:05,609 --> 00:12:07,620
...to your archives.

124
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:15,460
It's remarkable. Singular.

125
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:17,329
Someone is trying to make you believe.....

126
00:12:17,329 --> 00:12:19,960
......the illuminati themselves
have returned to Rome....

127
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:22,270
.....Right after the death of a Pope.

128
00:12:26,030 --> 00:12:28,949
Four cardinals were kidnapped from
their quarters inside the Vatican......

129
00:12:28,949 --> 00:12:32,029
.......sometime between 3 and 5 A. M.
this morning.

130
00:12:32,029 --> 00:12:33,909
Shortly afterward...

131
00:12:33,909 --> 00:12:36,999
...that document was sent to
the Office of the Swiss Guard...

132
00:12:36,999 --> 00:12:40,789
...along with the threat the cardinals
will be publicly executed...

133
00:12:40,789 --> 00:12:44,760
...one per hour, beginning at 8 P. M.
tonight in Rome.

134
00:12:55,430 --> 00:12:57,599
- Conclave.
- Was to begin today.

135
00:12:57,599 --> 00:13:01,109
We've postponed its start for
a few hours, a story of illness.

136
00:13:01,109 --> 00:13:03,620
There are no suspicions yet.

137
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:06,240
What do you want from me?

138
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:10,609
These criminals who sent this ambigram...

139
00:13:10,609 --> 00:13:13,619
...meant it as a taunt, a provocation.

140
00:13:13,619 --> 00:13:17,449
But Captain Olivetti think if you can
use it to learn their identity...

141
00:13:17,449 --> 00:13:20,840
...perhaps we can stop this abomination.

142
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:26,300
Why me?

143
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:30,100
Your expertise. Your erudition.

144
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:34,940
Your recent involvement with
certain Church, shall we say...

145
00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:36,820
...mysteries.

146
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:39,639
I wasn't under the impression
that episode...

147
00:13:39,639 --> 00:13:41,809
...had endeared me to the Vatican.

148
00:13:41,809 --> 00:13:43,320
Oh, it didn't.

149
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:46,319
But it did make you... What's the word?

150
00:13:46,319 --> 00:13:48,410
formidabile.

151
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:50,500
Formidable.

152
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:54,489
A vatican jet is standing by
20 minutes from here.

153
00:13:54,489 --> 00:13:55,960
Will you come with me?

154
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,379
Professore Langdon, you've
spent your life...

155
00:14:06,379 --> 00:14:09,890
...searching for symbols like the one
you now hold in your hand.

156
00:14:10,170 --> 00:14:12,219
How much longer are we going to pretend...

157
00:14:12,219 --> 00:14:14,850
...you have not already decided to come?

158
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:24,559
If the illuminati have returned
and are in Rome...

159
00:14:24,559 --> 00:14:27,990
...we will hunt them down and kill them.

160
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:30,939
The illuminati did not become violent...

161
00:14:30,939 --> 00:14:34,350
...until the 17th century.
Their name means "the enlightened ones"

162
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:37,409
They were physicists and mathematicians,
astronomers.

163
00:14:37,409 --> 00:14:40,449
They were concerned with the
Church's inaccurate teaching......

164
00:14:40,449 --> 00:14:42,579
......and they were dedicated to scientific truth.

165
00:14:42,579 --> 00:14:44,289
But the Vatican didn't like that.

166
00:14:44,289 --> 00:14:46,459
So the church began to...
How did you say it?

167
00:14:46,459 --> 00:14:49,669
Oh,"hunt them down and kill them. "

168
00:14:49,669 --> 00:14:51,560
Drove them underground.

169
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:55,140
Into a secret society.

170
00:15:55,450 --> 00:15:57,580
Excuse me.

171
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,829
Comandante Richter assures me the guard.....

172
00:16:07,829 --> 00:16:11,419
.....is doing everything humanly
possible to find the preferiti.

173
00:16:11,419 --> 00:16:14,640
A long way to say very little.

174
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:18,259
What if you were to begin in their absence?

175
00:16:18,259 --> 00:16:20,179
They are the four leading candidates.

176
00:16:20,179 --> 00:16:22,509
If they're not present,
they're not eligible.

177
00:16:22,509 --> 00:16:25,689
There will be no consensus without them.

178
00:16:25,689 --> 00:16:28,110
Who are we to vote for?

179
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:35,189
Yeah. "It is as much as sin to offer
flattery as to accept it."

180
00:16:35,189 --> 00:16:38,159
May I suggest you at least
consider the possibility.

181
00:16:38,159 --> 00:16:39,989
No, no, no. There is no possibility.

182
00:16:39,989 --> 00:16:44,960
I have been chosen Great Elector.
I am not eligible.

183
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:51,079
Camerlengo asks how long we can
postpone the opening prayer...

184
00:16:51,079 --> 00:16:53,959
...without making another
announcement to the public.

185
00:16:53,959 --> 00:16:55,619
Tell the camerlengo...

186
00:16:55,619 --> 00:16:58,799
...the cardinal-elect will
take every minute required...

187
00:16:58,799 --> 00:17:02,230
...to perform the sacred trust.

188
00:17:03,010 --> 00:17:05,900
No further announcements are necessary.

189
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:10,349
He will be concerned about
the public dimension.

190
00:17:10,349 --> 00:17:11,609
People will think that......

191
00:17:11,609 --> 00:17:14,280
.....What we tell them to think.

192
00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:19,819
- Professor Langdon.
- Yes.

193
00:17:19,819 --> 00:17:22,000
Welcome to Vatican City.

194
00:17:22,570 --> 00:17:24,459
Ernesto Olivetti...

195
00:17:24,459 --> 00:17:26,079
...Inspector General of the Vatican
police force.

196
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:28,209
- My pleasure.
- This way, please.

197
00:17:28,209 --> 00:17:31,170
We will meet in the headquarters
of the Swiss Guard.

198
00:17:31,170 --> 00:17:33,379
I thought you were Swiss Guard.

199
00:17:33,379 --> 00:17:35,209
No, la Gendarmeria.

200
00:17:35,209 --> 00:17:38,799
We are responsible for everything
inside the Vatican walls...

201
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:44,399
...with the exception of the security of His
Holiness and the Apostolic palace. Yeah.

202
00:17:44,399 --> 00:17:46,129
That is Swiss Guard.

203
00:17:46,129 --> 00:17:49,929
The Roman carabinieri are here
as well in an advisory capacity.

204
00:17:49,929 --> 00:17:51,759
So jurisdictionally, this is...

205
00:17:51,759 --> 00:17:53,940
A goddamn nightmare.

206
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,649
Oh, yes, Pope Pius IX's great castration.

207
00:18:03,649 --> 00:18:06,779
- I beg your pardon?
- 1857, Pope Pius IX...

208
00:18:06,779 --> 00:18:10,489
...felt the male form would inspire lust.

209
00:18:10,489 --> 00:18:12,159
So he took a hammer and chisel...

210
00:18:12,159 --> 00:18:15,130
...and unmanned hundreds of these statues.

211
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:19,220
The plaster fig leaves were added later.

212
00:18:20,670 --> 00:18:24,749
Are you anti-Catholic, Professor Langdon?

213
00:18:24,749 --> 00:18:28,470
No. I'm anti-vandalism.

214
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:34,610
I urge you to guard your tone here.

215
00:18:34,610 --> 00:18:38,729
The Swiss Guard is a calling,
not a profession...

216
00:18:38,729 --> 00:18:43,689
...and it encourages a certain civiltry.

217
00:18:43,689 --> 00:18:45,819
Commander Richter, the head of the Guard...

218
00:18:45,819 --> 00:18:47,649
...is a deeply spiritual man...

219
00:18:47,649 --> 00:18:50,359
...and he was close to the late Pope.
Understood?

220
00:18:50,359 --> 00:18:52,239
Look, I don't study symbols...

221
00:18:52,239 --> 00:18:53,659
...because I consider them unimportant.

222
00:18:53,659 --> 00:18:56,159
Ceremony, traditions,
it's how we mark our lives.

223
00:18:56,159 --> 00:18:58,199
I just- I just hope I can help.

224
00:18:58,199 --> 00:18:59,999
So do I.

225
00:18:59,999 --> 00:19:02,720
You were my idea.

226
00:19:13,890 --> 00:19:16,520
Wait here. Please.

227
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,059
Commander?

228
00:19:20,059 --> 00:19:21,690
Commander Richter?

229
00:19:22,310 --> 00:19:24,109
Professor Langdon is here.

230
00:19:24,109 --> 00:19:27,200
Well, we have bigger problems than that now.

231
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,790
Dr. Vetra?

232
00:19:32,490 --> 00:19:35,579
I'm Commander Richter,
comandante principale of the Swiss Guard.

233
00:19:35,579 --> 00:19:37,039
Thank you for coming.

234
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:38,880
Hello.

235
00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:41,249
- Professor Langdon.
- Yes.

236
00:19:41,249 --> 00:19:43,919
What a relief, the symbologist is here.

237
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:46,220
This way, please, Miss Vetra.

238
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,839
The situation has changed.

239
00:19:49,839 --> 00:19:53,299
We received another threat
from the kidnapper.

240
00:19:53,299 --> 00:19:56,259
The canister was stolen from
our lab around noon yesterday.

241
00:19:56,259 --> 00:19:58,269
The intruder killed my research partner,

242
00:19:58,269 --> 00:19:59,969
Silvano Bentivoglio...

243
00:19:59,969 --> 00:20:03,439
...and mutilated him in order
to bypass security.

244
00:20:03,439 --> 00:20:05,530
We use retinal scanners.

245
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:08,200
They cut out his eye.

246
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:11,740
Is that your stolen canister, Miss Vetra?

247
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,409
Where is that camera, Number 86?

248
00:20:14,409 --> 00:20:16,299
It's wireless. It too was stolen.

249
00:20:16,299 --> 00:20:18,199
It could be anywhere inside the Vatican walls.

250
00:20:18,199 --> 00:20:20,669
That canister contains an extremely
combustible substance...

251
00:20:20,669 --> 00:20:21,449
...called antimatter.

252
00:20:21,449 --> 00:20:24,499
We need to locate it immediately
or evacuate Vatican City.

253
00:20:24,499 --> 00:20:27,169
I'm quite familiar with incendiaries,
Miss Vetra.

254
00:20:27,169 --> 00:20:29,629
I've never heard of antimatter
being used as such.

255
00:20:29,629 --> 00:20:32,799
Well, it's never been generated in
significant quantities before.

256
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:35,679
It's a way of studying
the origins of the universe......

257
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:38,719
.....to try to isolate what some
people call "the God particle".

258
00:20:38,719 --> 00:20:41,099
But there are implications
for energy research----

259
00:20:41,099 --> 00:20:43,280
"The God particle"?

260
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:45,979
What we call it isn't important.

261
00:20:45,979 --> 00:20:47,809
It's what gives all matter mass.

262
00:20:47,809 --> 00:20:49,939
The thing without which we could not exist.

263
00:20:49,939 --> 00:20:52,819
You're talking about
"the moment of creation".

264
00:20:52,819 --> 00:20:54,750
Yes. In a way, I am.

265
00:20:55,530 --> 00:20:57,739
The antimatter is suspended there...

266
00:20:57,739 --> 00:21:01,489
...in an airtight nanocomposite shell with
electromagnets in each end.

267
00:21:01,489 --> 00:21:04,959
But if it were to fall out of suspension
and come in contact with matter.....

268
00:21:04,959 --> 00:21:07,999
......say, the bottom of the canister,
then the two opposing forces...

269
00:21:07,999 --> 00:21:10,249
...would annihilate one another violently.

270
00:21:10,249 --> 00:21:12,709
And what might cause it to
fall out of suspension?

271
00:21:12,709 --> 00:21:14,299
The battery going dead.

272
00:21:14,299 --> 00:21:17,799
- Which it will, just before midnight.
- What kind of annihilation?

273
00:21:17,799 --> 00:21:20,810
- How violent?
- A cataclysmic event.

274
00:21:20,810 --> 00:21:25,480
A blinding explosion equivalent
to about five kilotons.

275
00:21:25,690 --> 00:21:29,660
Vatican city will be "consumed by light".

276
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:33,989
Those are the exact words
the kidnapper used.

277
00:21:33,989 --> 00:21:37,710
We will destroy your four pillars.

278
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:40,409
We will brand your preferiti...

279
00:21:40,409 --> 00:21:43,909
...and sacrifice them on the altars
of science...

280
00:21:43,909 --> 00:21:47,039
...then bring your church down upon you.

281
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:50,709
Vatican City will be "consumed by light".

282
00:21:50,709 --> 00:21:55,680
A shining star at the end of
the Path of illumination.

283
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,599
It's the ancient illuminati threat.

284
00:22:02,599 --> 00:22:05,690
Destruction of Vatican city through light.

285
00:22:05,690 --> 00:22:09,439
Four pillars,
there is your kidnapped cardinals.

286
00:22:09,439 --> 00:22:12,000
You didn't tell me they were
the "preferiti......

287
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,530
......the favorites" to be named the next Pope.

288
00:22:16,610 --> 00:22:18,910
Play it again.

289
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:28,130
We will destroy your four pillars.

290
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:31,579
We will brand your preferiti......

291
00:22:31,579 --> 00:22:34,690
Wait, stop it. Stop it.
.....and sacrifice........

292
00:22:34,690 --> 00:22:37,350
"Brand" them.

293
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:41,489
That's another illuminati legend.

294
00:22:41,489 --> 00:22:46,929
This one says that there
are a set of five brands...

295
00:22:46,929 --> 00:22:48,309
...each one an ambigram.

296
00:22:48,309 --> 00:22:51,019
The first four are the fundamental
elements of science:

297
00:22:51,019 --> 00:22:53,269
Earth, air, fire and water.

298
00:22:53,269 --> 00:22:56,080
The fifth, it's a mystery.

299
00:22:57,860 --> 00:23:00,250
Maybe it's this.

300
00:23:00,610 --> 00:23:02,540
He said they'd be killed publicly.

301
00:23:02,870 --> 00:23:04,250
Yes.

302
00:23:04,490 --> 00:23:07,250
Revenge for la purga.

303
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:09,050
"La purga"?

304
00:23:10,370 --> 00:23:13,919
Oh, jeez, you guys don't even read
your own history, do you?

305
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:19,089
1668, the Church kidnapped
four illuminati scientists...

306
00:23:19,089 --> 00:23:21,379
...and branded each
one of them on the chest...

307
00:23:21,379 --> 00:23:23,469
...with the symbol of the cross...

308
00:23:23,469 --> 00:23:26,219
...to purge them of their sins,
and they executed them.

309
00:23:26,219 --> 00:23:28,639
Threw their bodies out
into the street as a warning...

310
00:23:28,639 --> 00:23:32,439
...to others to stop questioning Church
rulings on scientific matter.

311
00:23:32,439 --> 00:23:33,649
They radicalized them.

312
00:23:33,649 --> 00:23:36,769
The purga created a darker,
more violent illuminati...

313
00:23:36,769 --> 00:23:39,620
...one bent on retribution.

314
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,169
And look how they intend to finally get it:

315
00:23:42,169 --> 00:23:45,659
Using antimatter,
technology, to destroy the Church.

316
00:23:45,659 --> 00:23:48,250
Science obliterates religion.

317
00:23:49,370 --> 00:23:51,260
Is there any more?

318
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:56,039
.....and sacrifice them on the altars
of science.......

319
00:23:56,039 --> 00:23:59,089
...then bring your church down upon you.

320
00:23:59,089 --> 00:24:02,719
Vatican City will be consumed by light.

321
00:24:02,719 --> 00:24:07,139
...a shining star at the end of the Path
of illumination.

322
00:24:07,139 --> 00:24:09,570
"Path of illumination. "

323
00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:14,900
I need access to the Vatican archives.

324
00:24:16,690 --> 00:24:19,519
Professor, I don't think this is
the appropriate moment------

325
00:24:19,519 --> 00:24:21,300
Your petition has been denied seven times,

326
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:25,029
No, no. no. This has nothing to do with my
work. The Path of illumination......

327
00:24:25,029 --> 00:24:28,029
.....is a hidden trail through rome itself that
leads to the Church of the illumination.....

328
00:24:28,029 --> 00:24:31,289
......the place where
the illuminati would meet in secret.

329
00:24:31,289 --> 00:24:36,740
If I can find the segno, the sign that marks
the beginning of that path......

330
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:38,599
...the four churches along it......

331
00:24:38,599 --> 00:24:41,419
......may be where he intends to
murder your cardinals.

332
00:24:41,419 --> 00:24:44,499
One every hour at 8,9,10 and 11.

333
00:24:44,499 --> 00:24:47,450
Then the device explodes at midnight.

334
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:51,099
If we can figure out the first church
and get there before he does.....

335
00:24:51,099 --> 00:24:54,389
.....maybe we can stop it.
But I can't find the start of the path.....

336
00:24:54,389 --> 00:24:56,610
.....until I get into the archives.

337
00:24:57,270 --> 00:24:59,149
Even if I wanted to help you...

338
00:24:59,149 --> 00:25:01,819
...access to the archives is
only by written decree...

339
00:25:01,819 --> 00:25:04,859
...by the curator
and the Board of Vatican Librarians.

340
00:25:04,859 --> 00:25:06,699
Or by papal mandate.

341
00:25:06,699 --> 00:25:10,840
Yes, but as you no doubt have heard,
the Holy Father is dead.

342
00:25:11,370 --> 00:25:12,829
What about il camerlengo?

343
00:25:12,829 --> 00:25:16,329
The camerlengo is just a priest here,
the former Pope's chamberlain.

344
00:25:16,329 --> 00:25:20,640
Doesn't the power of the Holy See
rest in him during tempe sede vacante?

345
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:31,480
Fellas, you called me.

346
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:34,499
His Holiness once told me a Pope...

347
00:25:34,499 --> 00:25:38,229
......was a man torn between
the real world and the divine.

348
00:25:38,229 --> 00:25:41,700
It seems the real world is upon us tonight.

349
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:46,370
I'm familiar with illuminati lore
and the legend of the brandings.

350
00:25:46,370 --> 00:25:49,949
La purga is a dark stain
on this Church's history.

351
00:25:49,949 --> 00:25:53,290
I'm not surprised this ghost
has returned to haunt us.

352
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:58,749
Comandante, have you begun
the search for this explosive device?

353
00:25:58,749 --> 00:26:00,629
Of course, but it could be anywhere.

354
00:26:00,629 --> 00:26:02,169
My primary concern at the moment......

355
00:26:02,169 --> 00:26:03,709
......is the safety of the cardinals.

356
00:26:03,709 --> 00:26:05,879
The Sistine Chapel is a fortress.

357
00:26:05,879 --> 00:26:07,979
......as long as the cardinals are in conclave,

358
00:26:07,979 --> 00:26:08,759
.....your security concerns.....

359
00:26:08,759 --> 00:26:10,169
.....are at a minimum.

360
00:26:10,169 --> 00:26:11,469
Devote as many of your resources-----

361
00:26:11,469 --> 00:26:13,849
Señor, if you're about to suggest
a naked-eye search...

362
00:26:13,849 --> 00:26:15,539
...of the entire Vatican City,

363
00:26:15,539 --> 00:26:17,389
I will tell you the....."Comandante"
....we do not have the people.

364
00:26:17,389 --> 00:26:19,309
Though I'm not "His Holiness".

365
00:26:19,309 --> 00:26:20,659
...when you are addressing me...

366
00:26:20,659 --> 00:26:23,280
...you are addressing this office.
Do you understand?

367
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:26,620
Yes, Father.

368
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:28,950
Good.

369
00:26:29,490 --> 00:26:31,429
Now, you said the image on the screen......

370
00:26:31,429 --> 00:26:33,739
.......was illuminated by artificial light.

371
00:26:33,739 --> 00:26:36,039
Might I suggest methodically
cutting power......

372
00:26:36,039 --> 00:26:38,329
...to various sections of the city.

373
00:26:38,329 --> 00:26:41,079
When the image on the screen goes dark,
you'll have a more specific idea......

374
00:26:41,079 --> 00:26:43,470
...of the camera's location.

375
00:26:46,590 --> 00:26:50,219
Dr. Vetra, besides yourself
and your research partner...

376
00:26:50,219 --> 00:26:53,940
...who else knew about this
antimatter project?

377
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:56,719
No one but the research team.

378
00:26:56,719 --> 00:26:58,599
This project was strictly confidential.

379
00:26:58,599 --> 00:27:00,689
But Silvano kept detailed journals.

380
00:27:00,689 --> 00:27:02,480
If he told anyone else........

381
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:05,269
........about what we were doing,
he would have made a note of it.

382
00:27:05,269 --> 00:27:06,859
Do you have these journals?

383
00:27:06,859 --> 00:27:09,569
I can have them flown here from
Geneva in an hour.

384
00:27:09,569 --> 00:27:11,540
Please.

385
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:14,250
Professor Langdon.

386
00:27:25,130 --> 00:27:28,309
Mr. Langdon, you are correct that.....

387
00:27:28,309 --> 00:27:31,060
.....I may grant you access to the archives.

388
00:27:32,890 --> 00:27:34,699
Thank you, Padre.

389
00:27:34,699 --> 00:27:38,860
I said that you were correct that I may,
not that I will.

390
00:27:39,730 --> 00:27:43,030
Christianity's most sacred codices
are in that archive.

391
00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:47,819
Given your recent entanglement
with the Church...

392
00:27:47,819 --> 00:27:50,319
...there is a question I'd like to
ask you first here...

393
00:27:50,319 --> 00:27:53,080
...in the office of "His Holiness".

394
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:02,550
Do you believe in God, sir?

395
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:09,589
Father, I simply believe
that religion........

396
00:28:09,589 --> 00:28:13,259
I did not ask if you believe what
man says about God.

397
00:28:13,259 --> 00:28:15,390
I asked if you believe in God.

398
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:20,070
I'm an academic.

399
00:28:20,890 --> 00:28:24,099
My mind tells me I will never...

400
00:28:24,099 --> 00:28:25,860
...understand God.

401
00:28:26,610 --> 00:28:28,490
And your heart?

402
00:28:31,030 --> 00:28:33,620
Tells me I'm not meant to.

403
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:36,619
Faith is a gift...

404
00:28:36,619 --> 00:28:39,080
...that I have yet to receive.

405
00:28:45,290 --> 00:28:52,180
"Be delicate with our treasures".
[MAN SPEAKING IN ITALIAN]

406
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:55,629
The archives are this way.

407
00:28:55,629 --> 00:28:57,850
Professor Langdon.

408
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,449
If this path really leads......

409
00:29:00,449 --> 00:29:01,969
...to the Church of illumination...

410
00:29:01,969 --> 00:29:04,479
...that, may be where they have
hidden the antimatter.

411
00:29:04,479 --> 00:29:06,439
"A shining star at the end of the path."
I thought so too.

412
00:29:06,439 --> 00:29:07,649
Follow the path.

413
00:29:07,649 --> 00:29:09,359
And we may find the canister
at the end of it.

414
00:29:09,359 --> 00:29:10,649
Can you deactivate the device?

415
00:29:10,649 --> 00:29:12,299
I can change the canister's batteries...

416
00:29:12,299 --> 00:29:14,569
...as long as we have more than
five minutes of life.

417
00:29:14,569 --> 00:29:16,399
That would give us another 24 hours...

418
00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:18,520
...to get it safely back to CERN.

419
00:29:20,910 --> 00:29:22,119
Robert Langdon.

420
00:29:22,119 --> 00:29:23,949
Vittoria Vetra.

421
00:29:23,949 --> 00:29:27,629
Are you really a symbologist,
or was he mocking you?

422
00:29:27,629 --> 00:29:29,959
Well, both. You're a physicist?

423
00:29:29,959 --> 00:29:31,169
Bio-entanglement physics.

424
00:29:31,169 --> 00:29:33,339
Inter-connectivity of life systems.

425
00:29:33,339 --> 00:29:34,799
Okay.

426
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:38,009
Your project, it was geared
towards energy research?

427
00:29:38,009 --> 00:29:39,349
Eventually, yes.

428
00:29:39,349 --> 00:29:40,759
One speck of antimatter...

429
00:29:40,759 --> 00:29:43,599
...could power an entire city for a month.

430
00:29:43,599 --> 00:29:46,240
Or tonight, I guess, destroy one.

431
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:49,070
What are we looking for in the archives?

432
00:29:49,070 --> 00:29:51,019
Abound volume written by Galileo.

433
00:29:51,019 --> 00:29:52,819
Galileo was illuminati?

434
00:29:52,819 --> 00:29:55,750
Yeah. And an obedient Catholic
who didn't think...

435
00:29:55,750 --> 00:29:57,739
...that Church and science were enemies.

436
00:29:57,739 --> 00:30:00,239
...but just a different language
telling the same story.

437
00:30:00,239 --> 00:30:01,209
And "He" wanted like minds...

438
00:30:01,209 --> 00:30:03,079
...to find the Church of illumination...

439
00:30:03,079 --> 00:30:05,579
...but he couldn't exactly
advertise its location...

440
00:30:05,579 --> 00:30:08,630
...so, he created a coded path.

441
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:10,620
Richter has started to turn off the power......

442
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:11,879
......of various grids.

443
00:30:11,879 --> 00:30:14,300
It will be back on in a minute.

444
00:30:14,550 --> 00:30:16,609
Then some unknown illuminati master...

445
00:30:16,609 --> 00:30:18,520
...sculpted four statues.

446
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:21,599
Each one a tribute to one of the
fundamental elements...

447
00:30:21,599 --> 00:30:23,509
...earth, air, fire, water...

448
00:30:23,509 --> 00:30:25,339
...and placed the statues out in public...

449
00:30:25,339 --> 00:30:27,139
...in churches throughout Rome.

450
00:30:27,139 --> 00:30:29,899
Each statue held a clue pointing
to the next.

451
00:30:29,899 --> 00:30:32,569
At the end of the path was
the Church of illumination.

452
00:30:32,569 --> 00:30:35,689
If you could find that,
you were one of them.

453
00:30:35,689 --> 00:30:36,609
What makes you think...

454
00:30:36,609 --> 00:30:38,750
...he is going to murder the cardinals
in the churches?

455
00:30:38,750 --> 00:30:41,119
The illuminati called those four churches...

456
00:30:41,119 --> 00:30:45,119
...by the special name L'altare
della scienza.

457
00:30:45,119 --> 00:30:48,249
"Sacrifice them on the altars of science,"
he said.

458
00:30:48,249 --> 00:30:50,220
Exactly.

459
00:30:53,090 --> 00:30:56,610
Oh, wow. Look at this.
[BEEPING]

460
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:23,920
Excuse me, Señor.

461
00:31:25,030 --> 00:31:27,999
Cardinal Strauss,
you have been informed of the situation?

462
00:31:27,999 --> 00:31:29,760
Yeah.

463
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:32,199
My belief is we should proceed.......

464
00:31:32,199 --> 00:31:33,669
......with the sealing of conclave.

465
00:31:33,669 --> 00:31:37,629
At this late hour?
That would be highly unorthodox.

466
00:31:37,629 --> 00:31:39,939
And yet within Church laws.

467
00:31:39,939 --> 00:31:41,259
It's in my power. I am Great Elector.

468
00:31:41,259 --> 00:31:43,589
The cruelest honor in Christendom.

469
00:31:43,589 --> 00:31:47,139
I have no personal ambitions, Patrick.

470
00:31:47,139 --> 00:31:51,139
Only those I hold for my Church,
St. Peter's Church...

471
00:31:51,139 --> 00:31:54,149
...which is under attack at its most
vulnerable moment.

472
00:31:54,149 --> 00:31:55,729
And this is not a coincidence.

473
00:31:55,729 --> 00:31:57,729
The Church will not fall in a day.

474
00:31:57,729 --> 00:31:59,319
We must evacuate Vatican City.

475
00:31:59,319 --> 00:32:02,399
Oh, that is exactly what they want.

476
00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:04,239
Publicity and panic.

477
00:32:04,239 --> 00:32:07,540
No, we must not give them
oxygen for the media fire.

478
00:32:08,290 --> 00:32:10,659
But the people in St. Peter's Square.....

479
00:32:10,659 --> 00:32:14,999
.....Care deeply about their
Church, as we do.

480
00:32:14,999 --> 00:32:17,589
Their faith will sustain them.

481
00:32:17,589 --> 00:32:20,259
Their faith will not protect
them from an explosion.

482
00:32:20,259 --> 00:32:21,969
Well...

483
00:32:21,969 --> 00:32:26,639
We are all bound for heaven eventually,
are we not?

484
00:32:26,639 --> 00:32:27,599
Spoken like one who.........

485
00:32:27,599 --> 00:32:30,179
......has enjoyed the blessings of a long and full life.

486
00:32:30,179 --> 00:32:31,849
Patrick...

487
00:32:31,849 --> 00:32:33,209
...do not confuse the power...

488
00:32:33,209 --> 00:32:35,269
...of the office you temporarily hold...

489
00:32:35,269 --> 00:32:38,490
...with your true place here in the Vatican.

490
00:32:40,030 --> 00:32:42,830
You were a favorite of "His Holiness"......

491
00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:47,299
...but "His Holiness" is with his father now.

492
00:32:49,030 --> 00:32:50,630
Mea culpa.

493
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:53,050
Seal the doors.

494
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:10,020
Extra Omnes.

495
00:34:27,670 --> 00:34:30,220
Hello. This way, please.

496
00:34:31,130 --> 00:34:32,940
Oh, beautiful.

497
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:39,469
The chambers are hermetic vaults.

498
00:34:39,469 --> 00:34:41,799
Oxygen is kept at lowest possible levels.

499
00:34:41,799 --> 00:34:43,849
It's a partial vacuum inside.

500
00:34:43,849 --> 00:34:46,650
So extended stays are not recommended.

501
00:34:46,970 --> 00:34:50,640
So don't panic if you feel light-headed at first.

502
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:04,210
I will be just outside the door.

503
00:35:04,210 --> 00:35:07,030
Watching you, Mr. Langdon.

504
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:26,169
By the way,
it's normal to feel a little light-headed.

505
00:35:26,169 --> 00:35:27,479
Oh! Yeah.

506
00:35:27,479 --> 00:35:31,259
Feels like I'm scuba diving with
the wrong mixture.

507
00:35:31,259 --> 00:35:33,390
Take a second. We have time.

508
00:35:34,890 --> 00:35:36,969
Actually, I take that back.

509
00:35:36,969 --> 00:35:41,070
- Is that Mickey Mouse?
- Yeah. It's a long story.

510
00:36:32,610 --> 00:36:35,439
Conclave will go on without us.

511
00:36:35,439 --> 00:36:39,529
It must, now of all times.

512
00:36:39,529 --> 00:36:42,540
May God forgive you for what you have done.

513
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:52,340
Father, if God has issues...

514
00:36:53,170 --> 00:36:56,459
...they won't be with what I have done.

515
00:36:56,459 --> 00:36:59,560
They will be with what I'm about to do.

516
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:23,239
It was confiscated from the Netherlands...

517
00:37:23,239 --> 00:37:26,489
...by the Vatican just after Galileo died.

518
00:37:26,489 --> 00:37:29,119
I have been petitioning to see it
for about 10 years...

519
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:31,919
...ever since I realized what was in it.

520
00:37:31,919 --> 00:37:33,999
What makes you so sure that the segno's there?

521
00:37:33,999 --> 00:37:35,549
The number 503.

522
00:37:35,549 --> 00:37:38,149
I kept seeing it over and over again...

523
00:37:38,149 --> 00:37:41,409
...in illuminati letters scribbled
in the margins,

524
00:37:41,409 --> 00:37:43,679
sometimes just signed "503."

525
00:37:43,679 --> 00:37:45,509
It's a numeric clue. But to what?

526
00:37:45,509 --> 00:37:46,239
Five?

527
00:37:46,239 --> 00:37:48,599
Well, that's a meaningful number
to the illuminati.

528
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:49,699
There's the pentagram,

529
00:37:49,699 --> 00:37:52,059
Pythagoras,
dozens of other examples in science.

530
00:37:52,059 --> 00:37:53,269
But what about three...?

531
00:37:53,269 --> 00:37:54,899
....Didn't make sense until I thought,

532
00:37:54,899 --> 00:37:56,609
"What if it's Roman numerals?"

533
00:37:56,609 --> 00:38:00,649
- DIII.
- D-three. Galileo's third text.

534
00:38:00,649 --> 00:38:05,880
"Dialogo. Discorso. Diagramma. "

535
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:12,800
- Oh!
- Yeah.

536
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,350
Oh! Just a few days with this......

537
00:38:18,350 --> 00:38:20,549
...and I could have actually finished
my book...

538
00:38:20,549 --> 00:38:24,139
...and sold dozens of copies
at the Harvard bookstore.

539
00:38:24,139 --> 00:38:26,889
"IL Diagramma Veritatis. "

540
00:38:26,889 --> 00:38:29,020
Diagram of Truth.

541
00:38:29,430 --> 00:38:31,780
I know about Dialogo and Discorsi.

542
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:34,229
Galileo laid out his theories about...

543
00:38:34,229 --> 00:38:35,559
...the Earth revolving around the sun.

544
00:38:35,559 --> 00:38:36,539
Right, Yeah, and said...

545
00:38:36,539 --> 00:38:38,649
...the Earth was
not the center of some universe...

546
00:38:38,649 --> 00:38:40,309
...with heaven above, hell below,

547
00:38:40,309 --> 00:38:41,639
...as the Church had said it was.

548
00:38:41,639 --> 00:38:43,809
So they forced him to
recant in the second book.

549
00:38:43,809 --> 00:38:44,989
But what was this one?

550
00:38:44,989 --> 00:38:46,779
This is how he got the word out.

551
00:38:46,779 --> 00:38:47,869
This is the truth,

552
00:38:47,869 --> 00:38:49,739
...not what the Vatican forced him to write.

553
00:38:49,739 --> 00:38:51,069
Smuggled out of Rome,

554
00:38:51,069 --> 00:38:53,499
...printed in Holland on sedge papyrus, see?

555
00:38:53,499 --> 00:38:55,859
That way any scientist that was caught with a copy......

556
00:38:55,859 --> 00:38:57,339
......could just throw it in water...

557
00:38:57,339 --> 00:38:59,970
...and Galileo's heresy would dissolve,
disappear.

558
00:38:59,970 --> 00:39:03,419
And between that and Vatican burnings...

559
00:39:03,419 --> 00:39:04,450
...it's possible that...

560
00:39:04,450 --> 00:39:06,890
...this is the only copy that remains.

561
00:39:06,890 --> 00:39:08,929
And if I'm correct......

562
00:39:08,929 --> 00:39:13,769
...the segno is hidden on page number...

563
00:39:13,769 --> 00:39:15,519
Five.

564
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:17,360
Yeah.

565
00:39:23,610 --> 00:39:25,500
Do you need help with the Latin?

566
00:39:26,410 --> 00:39:27,750
Sure.

567
00:39:34,790 --> 00:39:40,090
Movement of the planets,
elliptical orbits, heliocentricity...

568
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:46,069
Sorry. I don't think there is anything that
could be interpreted as a......

569
00:39:46,069 --> 00:39:47,469
....Wait, wait, wait.

570
00:39:47,469 --> 00:39:49,770
Do that again.

571
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:52,440
What is that?

572
00:39:55,180 --> 00:39:58,439
Wait a minute. It's a watermark.
And there is a line of text.

573
00:39:58,439 --> 00:40:00,910
Go back.

574
00:40:01,770 --> 00:40:03,109
It's in English.

575
00:40:03,109 --> 00:40:06,649
English? Why English?

576
00:40:06,649 --> 00:40:08,350
English wasn't used in the Vatican.

577
00:40:08,350 --> 00:40:09,699
"It was too polluted".

578
00:40:09,699 --> 00:40:12,409
It's free thinking.
It was the language of radicals,

579
00:40:12,409 --> 00:40:15,289
like Shakespeare and Chaucer.

580
00:40:15,289 --> 00:40:16,319
Here's another one.

581
00:40:16,319 --> 00:40:19,749
"The path of light is laid, the sacred test. "

582
00:40:19,749 --> 00:40:24,470
- Will you write this down as I dictate?
- Sorry, Professor. No time.

583
00:40:28,890 --> 00:40:32,190
Yeah, yeah. What the hell? Yeah.

584
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:48,699
Twenty minutes till eight.

585
00:40:48,699 --> 00:40:50,699
- Where are we headed?
- Hold on. Hold on.

586
00:40:50,699 --> 00:40:54,000
I'll tell you in a minute.
Let me see that page again.

587
00:40:59,870 --> 00:41:01,829
Where did you get that paper?

588
00:41:01,829 --> 00:41:03,289
We borrowed it.

589
00:41:03,289 --> 00:41:06,709
"From Santi's earthly tomb,
with demon's hole... "

590
00:41:06,709 --> 00:41:08,009
Are you insane?

591
00:41:08,009 --> 00:41:11,310
"Cross Rome the mystic elements unfold."
[SPEAKS IN ITALIAN]

592
00:41:12,050 --> 00:41:14,860
"The path of light is laid, the sacred test."
[SPEAKS IN ITALIAN]

593
00:41:15,220 --> 00:41:19,560
"Let angels guide thee on thy lofty quest."
[SPEAKS IN ITALIAN]

594
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:22,809
You removed a document from
the Vatican archives?

595
00:41:22,809 --> 00:41:24,530
She did.

596
00:41:29,030 --> 00:41:31,239
"From Santi's earthly tomb... "

597
00:41:31,239 --> 00:41:34,579
- The first marker is at Santi's tomb.
- Yeah.

598
00:41:34,579 --> 00:41:36,989
- But who's Santi?
- Raphael.

599
00:41:36,989 --> 00:41:39,909
- IL Raffaello? The sculptor?
- Yeah. Santi was his last name.

600
00:41:39,909 --> 00:41:41,919
So, the path starts at Raphael's tomb?

601
00:41:41,919 --> 00:41:44,169
Raphael's buried at the Pantheon.

602
00:41:44,169 --> 00:41:47,640
- Isn't the Pantheon a church?
- The oldest Catholic church in Rome.

603
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:10,620
I just pulled a dozen of our best
men for this.

604
00:42:11,740 --> 00:42:14,449
You better be right. This is one
of the busiest spot in all of Rome.

605
00:42:14,449 --> 00:42:17,409
- He would never get away with it.
- It's impossible. The poem implies....

606
00:42:17,409 --> 00:42:19,619
....The poem? Unbelievable.

607
00:42:19,619 --> 00:42:21,079
I'm basing this operation...

608
00:42:21,079 --> 00:42:24,789
...on an American's interpretation
of a 400 year old poem.

609
00:42:24,789 --> 00:42:27,799
Well, the information we have clearly
refers to Raphael's tomb.

610
00:42:27,799 --> 00:42:29,709
And Raphael's tomb is inside that building.

611
00:42:29,709 --> 00:42:31,450
And because the Vatican destroyed.....

612
00:42:31,450 --> 00:42:33,969
....all of the pagan statues in the late-1800's,

613
00:42:33,969 --> 00:42:35,609
If this is the first marker,

614
00:42:35,609 --> 00:42:37,779
Whatever clues were here to lead
us to the next church are gone now.

615
00:42:37,779 --> 00:42:38,799
The path is dead.

616
00:42:38,799 --> 00:42:41,280
- So, this is it.
- Your only chance.

617
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:44,649
Separate approaches.

618
00:42:44,649 --> 00:42:48,399
No closer than two blocks and no uniforms.
Three minutes.

619
00:42:48,399 --> 00:42:50,780
And I need a set of eyes inside.

620
00:42:54,820 --> 00:42:56,119
Excuse me?

621
00:42:56,119 --> 00:42:58,519
Two weightlifters in matching
black suits and earpieces?

622
00:42:58,519 --> 00:42:59,699
They're hardly disguised.

623
00:42:59,699 --> 00:43:01,829
- Well, It's what I have.
- Well, Fine. I will go in.

624
00:43:01,829 --> 00:43:05,119
You don't have communication. You can't
carry a walkie talkie. It's too conspicuous.

625
00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:07,249
- Tourists have cell phones, donot they?
- No, no.

626
00:43:07,249 --> 00:43:09,760
You can't send her in there alone.

627
00:43:10,670 --> 00:43:12,810
All right. I won't.

628
00:43:23,850 --> 00:43:27,200
Don't look so anxious.
We are supposed to be married.

629
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,999
Well, maybe we are not getting
along today, hm?

630
00:43:32,690 --> 00:43:34,750
Hold my hand.

631
00:43:35,530 --> 00:43:40,670
- But don't crush it.
- Sorry. A nervous newlywed.

632
00:43:43,330 --> 00:43:46,170
Ooh. Look, honey. The oculus.

633
00:43:46,670 --> 00:43:48,879
That could be the
"demon's hole" in the poem.

634
00:43:48,879 --> 00:43:50,839
Why are the tombs at an angle?

635
00:43:50,839 --> 00:43:53,209
They're facing east to worship
the rising sun.

636
00:43:53,209 --> 00:43:54,919
But this is a Christian church.

637
00:43:54,919 --> 00:43:58,219
New religions often adopt
the existing customs and holidays...

638
00:43:58,219 --> 00:44:00,350
...to make conversion less of a shock.

639
00:44:00,890 --> 00:44:02,889
Like the 25th of December?

640
00:44:02,889 --> 00:44:05,519
It's the pagan
celebration of the Unconquered Sun.

641
00:44:05,519 --> 00:44:08,399
...and also makes a handy
date for the birth of Christ.

642
00:44:08,399 --> 00:44:10,350
- Let's check the recesses.
- Okay.

643
00:44:10,350 --> 00:44:13,740
I will go to the right.
I will meet you at 180 degrees.

644
00:44:15,570 --> 00:44:17,529
Follow me, please.

645
00:44:17,529 --> 00:44:21,329
Now, the Pantheon,
which means "Temple of all Gods",

646
00:44:21,329 --> 00:44:25,899
...was originally built as a
temple to all the gods of ancient Rome...

647
00:44:25,899 --> 00:44:28,119
...in 27 BC.

648
00:44:28,119 --> 00:44:31,709
Although the design of the
building is usually credited.....

649
00:44:31,709 --> 00:44:34,220
.....to Apollodorus of Damascus...

650
00:44:35,260 --> 00:44:37,060
Robert!

651
00:44:38,430 --> 00:44:40,640
Robert!

652
00:44:43,430 --> 00:44:44,809
It's Raphael's tomb.

653
00:44:44,809 --> 00:44:47,429
- But it's the wrong one.
- What are you talking about?

654
00:44:47,429 --> 00:44:49,879
He was moved here in 1759, a century....

655
00:44:49,879 --> 00:44:51,939
......after Diagramma was published.

656
00:44:51,939 --> 00:44:54,089
Where was he originally buried?

657
00:44:54,089 --> 00:44:56,939
Uh.....Urbino, I think. "Santi's earthly tomb. "

658
00:44:56,939 --> 00:44:59,870
What could it possibly be?
"Santi's earthly tomb. "

659
00:45:01,660 --> 00:45:04,420
Damn it! Santi's tomb.

660
00:45:04,420 --> 00:45:06,920
It must mean the chapel that he built.

661
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:09,119
He's not buried in it. He designed it.

662
00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:11,539
"The demon's hole. " It's not that oculus.

663
00:45:11,539 --> 00:45:13,289
It's an undercroft. It's a crypt.

664
00:45:13,289 --> 00:45:15,260
- Are there any questions?
- Yes.

665
00:45:16,010 --> 00:45:17,459
Yes.

666
00:45:17,459 --> 00:45:20,969
Did Raphael Santi ever design
a chapel with an ossuary annex...

667
00:45:20,969 --> 00:45:24,100
...and an angel figure
commissioned by the Catholic church?

668
00:45:25,470 --> 00:45:27,940
I'm sorry. I can only think of one.

669
00:45:29,310 --> 00:45:31,309
One is good.

670
00:45:31,309 --> 00:45:33,809
- Wrong? What do you mean, wrong?
- It's the Chigi chapel...

671
00:45:33,809 --> 00:45:36,149
...in the Church of the Santa Maria del Popolo.

672
00:45:36,149 --> 00:45:38,489
It was once called the Capella della Terra,

673
00:45:38,489 --> 00:45:39,489
The Chapel of the Earth.

674
00:45:39,489 --> 00:45:41,989
Earth. The first element. That's it.

675
00:45:41,989 --> 00:45:45,580
- You were certain about the Pantheon?
- We have four minutes. [Speaks In German].

676
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,909
Back to the Vatican. You can't.

677
00:45:49,909 --> 00:45:52,699
......Comandante, if you care at all about
your church, you will listen to me.

678
00:45:52,699 --> 00:45:54,470
My church?

679
00:45:55,840 --> 00:45:58,339
My church comforts the sick and dying.

680
00:45:58,339 --> 00:45:59,879
My church feeds the hungry.

681
00:45:59,879 --> 00:46:03,310
What does your church do, Mr. Langdon?

682
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:06,560
That's right. You don't have one.

683
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:10,480
Take him if you want. I'm done with him.

684
00:46:22,610 --> 00:46:25,909
All right, this makes sense. Look, look,
Look, right in front of the church.

685
00:46:25,909 --> 00:46:27,739
An obelisk. A lofty pyramid.

686
00:46:27,739 --> 00:46:30,539
Egyptian symbol adopted by the illuminati.

687
00:46:30,539 --> 00:46:33,970
If he is going to kill him, he will do it here.

688
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:51,610
Eight o'clock.

689
00:47:00,570 --> 00:47:02,490
Robert.

690
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:23,600
- No. No. Here.
- It's an Annulus.

691
00:47:51,570 --> 00:47:53,830
Which one is the Chigi Chapel?

692
00:47:53,830 --> 00:47:55,700
It's in one of these apses.

693
00:49:47,430 --> 00:49:49,809
Pyramids in a Catholic church.

694
00:49:49,809 --> 00:49:53,650
This is it. This is the Chigi Chapel.

695
00:50:11,580 --> 00:50:13,130
The Demon's Hole.

696
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:18,669
But it's askew.

697
00:50:18,669 --> 00:50:20,430
Come here.

698
00:50:26,850 --> 00:50:29,429
Hand me your flashlight.

699
00:50:29,429 --> 00:50:31,360
What's that?

700
00:51:30,020 --> 00:51:33,029
I call as my witness Christ the Lord...

701
00:51:33,029 --> 00:51:36,200
.......who will be my judge,
that my vote is given......

702
00:51:36,450 --> 00:51:39,290
......to the one before God.
I think should be elected.

703
00:52:03,090 --> 00:52:05,619
I elect as the most high pontiff.

704
00:52:05,619 --> 00:52:08,230
Dominic Scolamiero.

705
00:52:19,610 --> 00:52:24,450
[STRAUSS SPEAKING IN LATIN]
Eduardo Rossi.

706
00:52:24,450 --> 00:52:27,830
They are voting for
themselves to prevent a majority.

707
00:52:28,150 --> 00:52:31,659
They're waiting for the Preferiti
to be rescued.

708
00:52:31,659 --> 00:52:36,130
Perhaps we should as well, yes?

709
00:52:54,140 --> 00:52:56,099
Not until the smoke is white...

710
00:52:56,099 --> 00:52:59,689
...will the College of Cardinals have
chosen a new Holy Father.

711
00:52:59,689 --> 00:53:04,120
For now, the Vatican seat of ultimate
power remains vacant.

712
00:53:09,780 --> 00:53:13,069
Get the body out of there and search
the rest of the building.

713
00:53:13,069 --> 00:53:15,079
- Chartrand!
- Sir.

714
00:53:15,079 --> 00:53:17,659
Outside a perimeter. Secure but invisible.

715
00:53:17,659 --> 00:53:19,369
No lights, no guns. Nobody knows.

716
00:53:19,369 --> 00:53:20,579
- Understand?
- Yes, sir.

717
00:53:20,579 --> 00:53:22,709
I'm calling all off-duty.

718
00:53:22,709 --> 00:53:24,840
No information.

719
00:53:25,250 --> 00:53:27,709
Is it Raphael?

720
00:53:27,709 --> 00:53:29,810
The chapel is Raphael.

721
00:53:30,380 --> 00:53:32,940
But the sculptures are Bernini.

722
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:38,940
The unknown illuminati master...

723
00:53:39,770 --> 00:53:41,110
...Bernini?

724
00:53:42,230 --> 00:53:44,019
He worked for the church.

725
00:53:44,019 --> 00:53:46,609
Almost exclusively.

726
00:53:46,609 --> 00:53:49,990
But the illuminati were infiltrators.

727
00:53:50,650 --> 00:53:53,619
There wasn't a powerful organization
on earth they didn't penetrate,

728
00:53:53,619 --> 00:53:55,100
...including the Vatican........

729
00:53:55,100 --> 00:53:57,290
......by hiding in plain sight.

730
00:54:01,210 --> 00:54:03,550
Habakkuk and the Angel.

731
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:07,209
He's the prophet that predicted
the annihilation of the earth.

732
00:54:07,209 --> 00:54:11,930
"Let angels guide thee on thy lofty quest. "

733
00:54:15,220 --> 00:54:17,270
This is the first marker.

734
00:54:17,270 --> 00:54:19,320
The path is alive.

735
00:54:31,860 --> 00:54:33,489
Southwest.

736
00:54:33,489 --> 00:54:35,779
It was pointing southwest.

737
00:54:35,779 --> 00:54:39,369
Earth, air, fire, water.
We're looking for a Bernini sculpture...

738
00:54:39,369 --> 00:54:40,699
...having something to do with air.

739
00:54:40,699 --> 00:54:43,789
The second church is somewhere
southwest of here.

740
00:54:43,789 --> 00:54:45,329
You are sure this time?

741
00:54:45,329 --> 00:54:49,100
I need a map showing all
the churches of Rome.

742
00:54:51,800 --> 00:54:54,140
I could use it now.

743
00:55:29,170 --> 00:55:33,010
All right. The purple areas with these
black crosses represent the churches.

744
00:55:33,010 --> 00:55:35,719
But nothing intersects
the line until it hits...

745
00:55:35,719 --> 00:55:37,419
Until it hits St. Peter's.

746
00:55:37,419 --> 00:55:38,889
Michelangelo designed St. Peter's...

747
00:55:38,889 --> 00:55:39,819
...not Bernini.

748
00:55:39,819 --> 00:55:41,429
Michelangelo designed the Basilica.

749
00:55:41,429 --> 00:55:43,469
Bernini designed St. Peter's Square.

750
00:55:43,469 --> 00:55:44,759
The second marker must be...

751
00:55:44,759 --> 00:55:46,820
...a statue in St. Peter's Square.

752
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:54,819
It's 10 minutes till 9.
Can you go any faster?

753
00:55:54,819 --> 00:55:56,709
Not unless you want the full attention...

754
00:55:56,709 --> 00:55:57,960
...of the world press.

755
00:56:06,540 --> 00:56:10,379
There was no consensus
after the first ballot...

756
00:56:10,379 --> 00:56:12,159
...but Cardinal Baggia, the Italian,

757
00:56:12,159 --> 00:56:14,709
...is the odds-on favorite...

758
00:56:14,709 --> 00:56:18,429
There is no new Pope, but it is possible...

759
00:56:18,429 --> 00:56:20,659
...that Cardinal Guidera, the Spaniard,

760
00:56:20,659 --> 00:56:22,849
...is the most probable...

761
00:56:22,849 --> 00:56:25,559
It is possible that Cardinal Ebner,

762
00:56:25,559 --> 00:56:29,650
...from Germany, is the favorite...

763
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:33,819
Stem cell research is murder!

764
00:56:33,819 --> 00:56:36,859
You're condemning sick people to die.

765
00:56:36,859 --> 00:56:38,910
Man is not God.

766
00:56:51,290 --> 00:56:53,089
There, another obelisk.

767
00:56:53,089 --> 00:56:54,800
- Check the crowd.
- It's almost 9.....

768
00:56:54,800 --> 00:56:56,600
.....He has got to be here already.

769
00:57:31,290 --> 00:57:34,169
There must be a 100 statues up there.

770
00:57:34,169 --> 00:57:37,430
None of them are angels.
Those are all saints.

771
00:57:37,710 --> 00:57:39,719
How in God's name would anyone create...

772
00:57:39,719 --> 00:57:42,310
.......a sculpture about air?

773
00:57:49,600 --> 00:57:53,019
Bas-relief. Of course.
It's still a sculpture.

774
00:57:53,019 --> 00:57:55,859
Check the ground. Look at the carvings.

775
00:57:55,859 --> 00:57:58,830
Look for another
having something to do with air.

776
00:58:19,300 --> 00:58:21,890
"West Ponente. " West wind.

777
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:24,259
Vittoria!

778
00:58:24,259 --> 00:58:25,810
Here it is.

779
00:58:26,390 --> 00:58:29,849
West wind. An angel blowing
out five streaks of air.

780
00:58:29,849 --> 00:58:31,730
This is it.

781
00:59:35,210 --> 00:59:37,510
Get the police!

782
00:59:38,420 --> 00:59:40,340
Call an ambulance!

783
00:59:49,720 --> 00:59:51,110
He is still alive.

784
01:00:05,950 --> 01:00:09,210
His chest. They punctured his lungs.

785
01:00:23,420 --> 01:00:25,890
Clear the square.

786
01:01:28,990 --> 01:01:30,119
"from within your walls.....

787
01:01:30,119 --> 01:01:31,859
...to squeeze the life from the Bishop of Rome."

788
01:01:31,859 --> 01:01:33,229
I mean,
He's actually claiming responsibility...

789
01:01:33,229 --> 01:01:35,529
...for the death of "His Holiness."

790
01:01:35,529 --> 01:01:38,079
That's ridiculous. He died of a stroke.

791
01:01:38,079 --> 01:01:39,750
It implies the illuminati murdered him...

792
01:01:39,750 --> 01:01:41,329
...with his own medication.

793
01:01:41,329 --> 01:01:43,470
What?

794
01:01:43,750 --> 01:01:45,419
Down here.

795
01:01:45,419 --> 01:01:48,549
"With man's solution we stilled his heart.

796
01:01:48,549 --> 01:01:52,560
With his own needle did we
pierce his unholy veil. "

797
01:01:52,560 --> 01:01:53,849
Did the Holy Father take...

798
01:01:53,849 --> 01:01:56,349
...any kind of medication by injection?

799
01:01:56,349 --> 01:01:57,820
Tinzaparin.

800
01:01:58,430 --> 01:02:00,019
He had thrombophlebitis.

801
01:02:00,019 --> 01:02:03,519
He took an injection every day.
But no one knew that.

802
01:02:03,519 --> 01:02:04,769
Someone knew.

803
01:02:04,769 --> 01:02:08,279
Well, he had health concerns
and seizures as well.

804
01:02:08,279 --> 01:02:10,719
But he took steps to make sure he was watched...

805
01:02:10,719 --> 01:02:11,859
.........for safety.

806
01:02:11,859 --> 01:02:13,719
He didn't want it made public,

807
01:02:13,719 --> 01:02:15,119
...so we have no reason to discuss it.

808
01:02:15,119 --> 01:02:17,829
Tinzaparin is lethal in the wrong dosage.

809
01:02:17,829 --> 01:02:20,409
An overdose could cause massive
internal bleeding...

810
01:02:20,409 --> 01:02:21,749
...and brain hemorrhages.

811
01:02:21,749 --> 01:02:23,509
It might look like a stroke at first,

812
01:02:23,509 --> 01:02:25,709
...but in a few days his body
would show signs.

813
01:02:25,709 --> 01:02:27,289
This could easily be examined.

814
01:02:27,289 --> 01:02:29,129
Ms. Vetra, In case you're not aware of it...

815
01:02:29,129 --> 01:02:32,679
...papal autopsy is prohibited
by Vatican law.

816
01:02:32,679 --> 01:02:35,089
We're not going to defile "His Holiness's" body.

817
01:02:35,089 --> 01:02:36,889
...just because his enemies claims----

818
01:02:36,889 --> 01:02:38,699
Why would they send this letter now?
Well.....

819
01:02:38,699 --> 01:02:40,099

823
01:02:47,519 --> 01:02:48,609
Obviously they were hoping...

824
01:02:48,609 --> 01:02:50,529
...this letter would become public.

825
01:02:50,529 --> 01:02:52,699
We might be wise to pre-empt their next attempt...

826
01:02:52,699 --> 01:02:54,050
...by making an announcement of our own...

827
01:02:54,050 --> 01:02:55,989
...to refute this absurd claim.

828
01:02:55,989 --> 01:02:57,699
That's out of the question.

829
01:02:57,699 --> 01:02:58,819
Cardinal Strauss has insisted...

830

...this entire matter be kept internal.

831
01:03:00,999 --> 01:03:03,329
He shouldn't even be aware of it.
He's locked in conclave.

832
01:03:03,329 --> 01:03:06,239
His final instructions before
sealing the doors...

833
01:03:06,239 --> 01:03:07,419
...were very clear.

834

Cardinal Strauss does not dictate
Vatican protocols.

835
01:03:11,170 --> 01:03:13,259
As you say, yet, technically......

836
01:03:13,259 --> 01:03:14,969
......now that conclave has begun.....

837
01:03:14,969 --> 01:03:16,579
...it's his privilege and duty...

01:03:16,579 --> 01:03:18,179
...to control public announcements.

839

I have drafted a press release...

840

...about the incident in the piazza...

841
01:03:21,019 --> 01:03:22,929
...but any other statements...

842
01:03:22,929 --> 01:03:24,689
...are specifically prohibited.

843
01:03:24,689 --> 01:03:28,199
For that, Cardinal has asked
me to remind you...

...we have a chimney.

01:03:36,199 --> 01:03:38,689
Well, we have turned the power on and off...

847
01:03:38,689 --> 01:03:40,239

How long would you need to evacuate everyone?

But there were five of them,
so there is room for error.

860

About 20 churches intersect those lines.

965
01:11:06,640 --> 01:11:09,939
He told me, "Learn to fly. "

966
01:11:09,939 --> 01:11:12,349
So I joined the Aeronautica Militare.....

967
01:11:12,349 --> 01:11:14,219
......flew helicopters,

968
01:11:14,219 --> 01:11:16,279
.....bringing the wounded back to hospital.

969
01:11:16,279 --> 01:11:17,649
He was a great man.

970
01:11:17,649 --> 01:11:20,000
Your father died?

971
01:11:20,650 --> 01:11:22,580
Fourteen days ago.

972
01:11:23,570 --> 01:11:25,739
Command, do you read me?

973
01:11:25,739 --> 01:11:28,659
Power is off. Oxygen is very low.

974
01:11:28,659 --> 01:11:30,959
Come in. Can you read me?

975
01:11:30,959 --> 01:11:32,209
Can you get anything?

976
01:11:32,209 --> 01:11:36,760
No. The walls are lead-lined.
There's no signal.

977
01:14:59,120 --> 01:15:00,800
This way.

978
01:15:09,010 --> 01:15:13,310
If the Holy Father was murdered,
the implications are profound.

979
01:15:13,640 --> 01:15:15,929
Vatican security is impenetrable.

980
01:15:15,929 --> 01:15:19,019
No one from the outside could have
got anywhere near him.

981
01:15:19,019 --> 01:15:20,809
It was someone on the inside.

982
01:15:20,809 --> 01:15:23,910
And we can trust no one.

983
01:15:25,400 --> 01:15:28,740
No light reaction on Zone 97.

984
01:15:28,740 --> 01:15:33,029
Based on the rate
the battery is using power...

985
01:15:33,029 --> 01:15:36,420
...the device will detonate just
before midnight.

986
01:15:58,060 --> 01:16:00,360
Holy Father...

987
01:16:00,810 --> 01:16:01,969
...when I was young,

988
01:16:01,969 --> 01:16:04,740
You told me the voice in my heart
was God's voice.

989
01:16:05,230 --> 01:16:08,319
You said I should follow it,
no matter how painful.

990
01:16:08,319 --> 01:16:11,879
Forgive me, please.

991
01:16:11,879 --> 01:16:13,930
Give me strength.

992
01:16:14,930 --> 01:16:20,230
What I do, I do in
the name of everything you believe.

993
01:16:30,610 --> 01:16:32,410
Remove the cover.

994
01:16:35,450 --> 01:16:37,529
Did you not hear me?

995
01:16:37,529 --> 01:16:40,739
Signore, by law, we are at your command, but...

996
01:16:40,739 --> 01:16:42,300
One day I will ask your forgiveness....

997
01:16:42,300 --> 01:16:44,289
....For putting you in this position.

998
01:16:44,289 --> 01:16:46,420
But today I ask your obedience.

999
01:16:48,040 --> 01:16:50,919
Vatican laws are
there to protect this church.

1000
01:16:50,919 --> 01:16:52,109
And it's in that spirit.

1001
01:16:52,109 --> 01:16:55,390
That I command you to break one of them now.

1002
01:17:50,600 --> 01:17:52,570
God help us.

1003
01:18:05,240 --> 01:18:08,369
Santa Maria della Vittoria. Do you know it?

1004
01:18:08,369 --> 01:18:11,920
- Yes, I do.
- It's the next church.

1005
01:18:27,780 --> 01:18:29,909
I think someone just tried to kill me.

1006
01:18:29,909 --> 01:18:32,109
Professor, I promise you we had no idea......

1007
01:18:32,109 --> 01:18:33,269
- He knows I am here.
- Yes.

1008
01:18:33,269 --> 01:18:34,199
You heard me ask permission.

1009
01:18:34,199 --> 01:18:35,000
You gave me an escort.

1010
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:36,289
Yes, but we had no idea......

1011
01:18:36,289 --> 01:18:40,629
....that portions of our white zones
were cross-wired with that building.

1012
01:18:40,629 --> 01:18:42,749
Commander Richter was extending the search.

1013
01:18:42,749 --> 01:18:44,569
If he had known the archives
were on that grid....

1014
01:18:44,569 --> 01:18:46,520
....He never would have killed the power.

1015
01:18:47,260 --> 01:18:49,719
Or there is the other possibility.

1016
01:18:49,719 --> 01:18:52,520
Is it conceivable the illuminati.....

1017
01:18:53,350 --> 01:18:55,530
.....have infiltrated the Swiss Guard?

1018
01:18:58,520 --> 01:19:00,320
......perhaps.

1019
01:19:05,530 --> 01:19:08,199
I want to speak to the camerlengo.

1020
01:19:08,199 --> 01:19:10,279
The camerlengo is unavailable.

1021
01:19:10,279 --> 01:19:14,250
He has found evidence that the Holy Father
was indeed murdered.

1022
01:19:15,370 --> 01:19:18,010
- He is seeking guidance.
- From whom?

1023
01:19:18,670 --> 01:19:20,720
From God.

1024
01:19:20,720 --> 01:19:22,999
- Make an effort, please.
- Yeah, yeah.

1025
01:19:55,580 --> 01:19:57,210
The journals. Where are they?

1026
01:19:59,910 --> 01:20:02,470
Who took the journals from this desk?

1027
01:20:10,300 --> 01:20:12,549
Someone is here? What is this?

1028
01:20:12,549 --> 01:20:15,560
Signore, this is unacceptable.

1029
01:20:15,850 --> 01:20:17,599
For a camerlengo to enter the chapel.

1030
01:20:17,599 --> 01:20:19,349
Once conclave has begun...

1031
01:20:19,349 --> 01:20:22,900
Forgive me. There's been a development.

1032
01:20:33,110 --> 01:20:35,949
His Holiness Celestine V was murdered.

1033
01:20:35,949 --> 01:20:39,909
Is it so hard to believe it could
happen again? Signori...

1034
01:20:39,909 --> 01:20:42,249
...Signori, please a moment.

1035
01:20:42,249 --> 01:20:45,130
Please, signori.

1036
01:20:46,210 --> 01:20:49,100
Our Church is at war.

1037
01:20:49,880 --> 01:20:53,509
We are under attack from an old enemy.

1038
01:20:53,509 --> 01:20:55,180
The illuminati.

1039
01:20:55,930 --> 01:20:57,940
They have struck us from within.

1040
01:20:57,940 --> 01:21:00,570
Murdering our Holy Father.

1041
01:21:00,570 --> 01:21:01,999
And threatening us all.

1042
01:21:01,999 --> 01:21:05,559
With destruction at the
hands of their new god, science.

1043
01:21:05,559 --> 01:21:07,459
They call it retribution. They....

1044
01:21:07,459 --> 01:21:08,939
.....They think it justified.

1045
01:21:08,939 --> 01:21:11,989
Because of the Church's attacks
on men of science in the distant past.

1046
01:21:11,989 --> 01:21:13,950
And it's true.

1047
01:21:14,280 --> 01:21:15,739
Since the days of Galileo...

1048
01:21:15,739 --> 01:21:19,659
...this Church has tried to slow
the relentless march of progress...

1049
01:21:19,659 --> 01:21:22,250
...sometimes with misguided means.

1050
01:21:23,410 --> 01:21:27,249
But science and religion are not enemies.

1051
01:21:27,249 --> 01:21:29,089
There are simply some things...

1052
01:21:29,089 --> 01:21:32,339
...that science is just too young to understand.

1053
01:21:32,339 --> 01:21:34,879
So the Church pleads, "Stop".

1054
01:21:34,879 --> 01:21:37,730
"Slow down. Think. Wait."

1055
01:21:37,730 --> 01:21:40,849
And for this they call us backward.

1056
01:21:40,849 --> 01:21:43,500
But who is more ignorant.......

1057
01:21:43,500 --> 01:21:45,599
......the man who cannot define lightning......

1058
01:21:45,599 --> 01:21:49,820
...or the man who does not respect its
natural awesome power?

1059
01:21:50,140 --> 01:21:52,980
The battle is well underway, signori.

1060
01:21:53,350 --> 01:21:55,229
We must defend ourselves.

1061
01:21:55,229 --> 01:21:58,399
But what if this time we fight
their stealth with openness?

1062
01:21:58,399 --> 01:22:01,189
Combat their wicked scheme
with simple truth...

1063
01:22:01,189 --> 01:22:04,540
...and end this brutish
battle once and for all.

1064
01:22:06,820 --> 01:22:09,429
We must open the doors,

1065
01:22:09,429 --> 01:22:13,499
Tear down the blacken curtains
and speak to our flock.

1066
01:22:13,499 --> 01:22:16,579
If the outside world could
see this Church as I do...

1067
01:22:16,579 --> 01:22:18,919
...looking beyond
the ritual of these walls...

1068
01:22:18,919 --> 01:22:22,589
...they would see a modern miracle.

1069
01:22:22,589 --> 01:22:25,759
A brotherhood of imperfect, simple souls...

1070
01:22:25,759 --> 01:22:28,639
...who want nothing more
than to be voices of compassion...

1071
01:22:28,639 --> 01:22:32,310
...in a world spinning out of control.

1072
01:22:33,140 --> 01:22:36,940
Signori, I ask......

1073
01:22:37,600 --> 01:22:42,450
...I pray... that you break this conclave.

1074
01:22:43,030 --> 01:22:48,029
Open the doors...
evacuate St. Peter's Square...

1075
01:22:48,029 --> 01:22:51,250
...and tell the world the truth.

1076
01:23:24,660 --> 01:23:26,709
Oh, my God.

1077
01:23:26,709 --> 01:23:28,930
Get him down!

1078
01:23:29,840 --> 01:23:30,590
No!

1079
01:23:40,610 --> 01:23:42,849
There, there, that chain. On that pulley.

1080
01:23:42,849 --> 01:23:46,630
- This bench. Get this pew up here.
- Make a ladder. [GUNSHOTS].

1081
01:25:32,330 --> 01:25:33,999
<i>Gendarmeria Vaticana.
[ = I am a cop. ]</i>

1082
01:26:52,350 --> 01:26:53,730
My son...

1083
01:26:55,190 --> 01:26:58,400
...God answers all prayers but...

1084
01:26:59,190 --> 01:27:01,330
...sometimes his answer is no.

1085
01:27:03,240 --> 01:27:06,160
The college will not break conclave.

1086
01:27:07,160 --> 01:27:08,790
May I suggest.....

1087
01:27:09,330 --> 01:27:10,869
.....you direct your energies...

1088
01:27:10,869 --> 01:27:14,840
......to helping the Swiss Guard find this
explosive device...

1089
01:27:15,210 --> 01:27:17,170
...if it exists.

1090
01:27:18,170 --> 01:27:20,810
And leave Church leadership.........

1091
01:27:22,300 --> 01:27:24,180
......to its leaders.

1092
01:27:37,060 --> 01:27:38,530
Eminence.

1093
01:27:40,900 --> 01:27:43,069
There is a growing fear.

1094
01:27:43,069 --> 01:27:45,540
That without the four preferiti...

1095
01:27:45,820 --> 01:27:51,159
...a two-thirds majority for any
candidate will not be possible.

1096
01:27:51,159 --> 01:27:54,300
- Unless.
- Speak plainly.

1097
01:27:55,080 --> 01:27:56,869
It is the recommendation of many...

1098
01:27:56,869 --> 01:28:00,800
...that you ask to be removed
from your post as Great Elector...

1099
01:28:01,540 --> 01:28:08,030
......thereby making yourself eligible......
to wear the Ring of the Fisherman.

1100
01:28:09,590 --> 01:28:14,190
Well... if it is God's will......

1101
01:28:21,150 --> 01:28:23,200
...may "His will" be done.

1102
01:28:51,300 --> 01:28:53,940
Signore, are you okay?

1103
01:29:18,620 --> 01:29:20,199
Those journals are private property.

1104
01:29:20,199 --> 01:29:21,669
I demand that you return them to me.

1105
01:29:21,669 --> 01:29:25,550
They are material
evidence in a Vatican investigation.

1106
01:29:27,260 --> 01:29:28,910
I am an Italian citizen.

1107
01:29:28,910 --> 01:29:31,209
My rights do not end just because
I crossed to the other.

1108
01:29:31,209 --> 01:29:32,300
This is not Italy.

1109
01:29:32,590 --> 01:29:34,799
It's not even Rome, it's the Vatican.

1110
01:29:34,799 --> 01:29:36,759
A country of its own with its own laws.

1111
01:29:36,759 --> 01:29:38,729
And when those journals passed the border,

1112
01:29:38,729 --> 01:29:40,269
They became my property.

1113
01:29:40,269 --> 01:29:42,069
And I will give them back to you...

1114
01:29:42,069 --> 01:29:42,969
......when I have decided.....

1115
01:29:42,969 --> 01:29:45,769
....they contain nothing of value
to the investigation.

1116
01:29:45,769 --> 01:29:49,200
Do you have something to hide,
Commandante Richter?

1117
01:29:51,400 --> 01:29:54,000
Do you, Dr. Vetra?

1118
01:30:15,550 --> 01:30:18,810
Were it up to me,
it would not be this way.

1119
01:30:19,930 --> 01:30:22,900
It's a sin to kill with pain.

1120
01:30:23,730 --> 01:30:25,860
It's a sin to kill without reason.

1121
01:30:29,440 --> 01:30:34,290
Father, they make me a sinner.

1122
01:31:13,770 --> 01:31:16,660
Saint Teresa on fire.

1123
01:31:19,440 --> 01:31:21,410
Professor Langdon?

1124
01:31:22,320 --> 01:31:24,409
- What direction is that?
- West, I think.

1125
01:31:24,409 --> 01:31:27,540
"Cross Rome the mystic elements unfold. "

1126
01:31:28,660 --> 01:31:31,119
Piazza Barberini is here.

1127
01:31:31,119 --> 01:31:34,420
Saint Teresa is here.

1128
01:31:34,710 --> 01:31:36,999
Where is the Santa Maria del Popolo,
the first altar of science?

1129
01:31:36,999 --> 01:31:39,930
- Santa Maria del Popolo?
- Yes.

1130
01:31:40,710 --> 01:31:42,510
Thank you.

1131
01:31:42,920 --> 01:31:45,219
St. Peter's is here.

1132
01:31:45,219 --> 01:31:47,640
We are here.

1133
01:31:48,890 --> 01:31:50,730
A church with water.

1134
01:31:52,770 --> 01:31:54,729
Wait, wait, wait.

1135
01:31:54,729 --> 01:31:56,700
"Cross Rome. "

1136
01:31:58,520 --> 01:32:00,729
The poem must mean it literally, cross Rome.

1137
01:32:00,729 --> 01:32:03,069
Professor Langdon,
Commander Richter has ordered me...

1138
01:32:03,069 --> 01:32:04,949
...to escort you to the Vatican immediately.

1139
01:32:04,949 --> 01:32:06,279
Piazza Navona.

1140
01:32:06,279 --> 01:32:10,199
Earth. Air. Fire. Water.

1141
01:32:10,199 --> 01:32:12,329
Cross Rome.

1142
01:32:12,329 --> 01:32:14,800
Bernini's Four Rivers.

1143
01:32:15,210 --> 01:32:16,379
Professor Langdon,

1144
01:32:16,379 --> 01:32:18,709
The Vatican insists that
I have to take you back immediately.

1145
01:32:18,709 --> 01:32:21,879
The Vatican is about to see its fourth
cardinal murdered tonight.

1146
01:32:21,879 --> 01:32:24,649
Now, look. You can do.....

1147
01:32:24,649 --> 01:32:26,969
........as they say and force me back
to the Vatican...

1148
01:32:26,969 --> 01:32:29,179
...Where we can all mourn his
death together.

1149
01:32:29,179 --> 01:32:31,839
Or you can show how real cops act,

1150
01:32:31,839 --> 01:32:33,269
And take me to the Piazza Navona.

1151
01:32:33,269 --> 01:32:36,780
Where we still might be able to stop it.

1152
01:32:39,440 --> 01:32:42,319
Oh, by all means, let's talk it over.

1153
01:32:42,319 --> 01:32:45,290
In 14 minutes, he is going to be dead.

1154
01:32:50,910 --> 01:32:52,380
This way, professor.

1155
01:33:00,750 --> 01:33:02,709
Yes, Padre?

1156
01:33:02,709 --> 01:33:06,719
At 11:15, if the Church is still in peril...

1157
01:33:06,719 --> 01:33:09,890
...give the order to evacuate the cardinals.

1158
01:33:09,890 --> 01:33:12,349
But with dignity.

1159
01:33:12,349 --> 01:33:16,479
Let them walk out into St. Peter's Square
with their heads held high.

1160
01:33:16,479 --> 01:33:19,309
I don't want the last image of
this Church to be of frightened old men...

1161
01:33:19,309 --> 01:33:21,780
......sneaking out the back door.

1162
01:33:38,580 --> 01:33:40,920
"Let angels guide thee... "

1163
01:33:46,010 --> 01:33:47,759
There it is.

1164
01:33:47,759 --> 01:33:50,049
- There it is.
- Professor, I know this fountain.

1165
01:33:50,049 --> 01:33:53,759
- There is no angel on it.
- The dove. The Angel of Peace.

1166
01:33:53,759 --> 01:33:56,269
And it's looking in what direction?

1167
01:33:56,269 --> 01:33:58,280
...east, I think.

1168
01:34:09,400 --> 01:34:11,000
Professor, just wait here.

1169
01:34:11,360 --> 01:34:13,420
Stay put.

1170
01:34:49,740 --> 01:34:52,120
Good evening, can I help you?

1171
01:34:52,120 --> 01:34:54,750
I am waiting for a doctor.

1172
01:35:10,920 --> 01:35:12,930
Come here.

1173
01:35:15,510 --> 01:35:18,440
Stay calm, don't shoot.

1174
01:35:55,460 --> 01:35:56,840
Hey!

1175
01:36:11,390 --> 01:36:12,979
Help!

1176
01:36:12,979 --> 01:36:14,320
Somebody help!

1177
01:36:53,390 --> 01:36:55,400
Help! Somebody.

1178
01:38:09,180 --> 01:38:10,929
Cardinal Baggia?

1179
01:38:10,929 --> 01:38:12,480
Cardinal Baggia.

1180
01:38:14,470 --> 01:38:16,639
Where was he hiding you?

1181
01:38:16,639 --> 01:38:19,070
The Church of illumination. Where is it?

1182
01:38:19,390 --> 01:38:22,990
Castel-Castel Sant'Angelo.

1183
01:38:24,190 --> 01:38:25,910
Castle of the Angel.

1184
01:38:48,590 --> 01:38:51,850
Sir, there is news about Cardinal Baggia.

1185
01:38:52,090 --> 01:38:55,799
The cardinal told Langdon he was being
held in Castel Sant'Angelo.

1186
01:38:55,799 --> 01:38:58,889
If Langdon's right,
that's where the bomb is.

1187
01:38:58,889 --> 01:39:00,809
Send everyone we can spare.

1188
01:39:00,809 --> 01:39:02,139
And you?

1189
01:39:02,139 --> 01:39:04,150
I am staying here.

1190
01:39:17,200 --> 01:39:19,040
Vittoria.

1191
01:39:19,580 --> 01:39:21,249
- You are all right?
- I am all right.

1192
01:39:21,249 --> 01:39:22,999
What about you?
I just heard about Olivetti on the radio.

1193
01:39:22,999 --> 01:39:24,680
I am all right. I am okay.

1194
01:39:30,630 --> 01:39:34,089
Robert, we can't trust Richter.
He took Silvano's journals.

1195
01:39:34,089 --> 01:39:36,969
There must be something in
there he doesn't want us to see.

1196
01:39:36,969 --> 01:39:39,060
The head of the Swiss Guard.

1197
01:39:40,180 --> 01:39:41,949
Castel Sant'Angelo. It's close enough...

1198
01:39:41,949 --> 01:39:43,439
...so the wireless signal from
that camera...

1199
01:39:43,439 --> 01:39:45,490
...could still reach the Vatican.

1200
01:39:47,110 --> 01:39:50,109
The Church of illumination is
somewhere here...

1201
01:39:50,109 --> 01:39:52,700
...and your canister is inside it.

1202
01:40:12,760 --> 01:40:14,520
Come with me.

1203
01:40:18,140 --> 01:40:21,929
For 400 years, the illuminati met
right under the Church's nose.

1204
01:40:21,929 --> 01:40:25,559
The Vatican used this as a hideout
and as a prison for their enemies.

1205
01:40:25,559 --> 01:40:30,609
If the explosion happens here,
would the blast radius take out the Vatican?

1206
01:40:30,609 --> 01:40:32,950
And part of Rome along with it.

1207
01:40:34,700 --> 01:40:36,370
Go on.

1208
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:53,009
They are pointing to it. The angels.

1209
01:40:53,009 --> 01:40:55,270
The canister must be down there.
Come on!

1210
01:41:43,350 --> 01:41:44,329
Where are they going?

1211
01:41:44,329 --> 01:41:45,849
Back to search the outer castle.

1212
01:41:45,849 --> 01:41:48,490
No, no. It has to be here!

1213
01:41:53,230 --> 01:41:55,189
Robert, it's a dead end.

1214
01:41:55,189 --> 01:41:57,399
No, it's not.

1215
01:41:57,399 --> 01:42:00,080
See if you can find a flashlight.

1216
01:42:16,710 --> 01:42:19,299
All of these stones are rectangular
granite.

1217
01:42:19,299 --> 01:42:22,690
Except right here. What is this?

1218
01:42:26,100 --> 01:42:27,610
It's a pentagram.

1219
01:42:27,610 --> 01:42:29,110
An eye...

1220
01:42:29,520 --> 01:42:31,269
...that leads to...

1221
01:42:31,269 --> 01:42:33,070
Nowhere.

1222
01:42:41,950 --> 01:42:43,500
Robert?

1223
01:42:45,120 --> 01:42:47,789
These walls overlap and there is
a passageway back here.

1224
01:42:47,789 --> 01:42:49,630
Here. Let me have the flashlight.

1225
01:43:13,150 --> 01:43:16,439
It's a passageway that leads to the Vatican.

1226
01:43:16,439 --> 01:43:18,280
An ancient escape route.

1227
01:43:20,820 --> 01:43:22,160
My God.

1228
01:43:24,820 --> 01:43:26,460
Here.

1229
01:43:28,410 --> 01:43:30,630
Look.

1230
01:43:52,010 --> 01:43:57,630
This would be the perfect place for the illuminati
to blow the whole building up, here, here.

1231
01:44:03,030 --> 01:44:07,199
Get on the radio. Get the word out.
Conclave remains sealed.

1232
01:44:07,199 --> 01:44:09,829
But the Camerlengo gave
the order for evacuation at eleven......

1233
01:44:09,829 --> 01:44:11,920
....I am countermanding it.

1234
01:44:17,210 --> 01:44:19,640
This is it. This is their church.

1235
01:44:21,710 --> 01:44:25,020
The canister should be lit by artificial light.

1236
01:44:48,490 --> 01:44:49,829
It's not here, Robert.

1237
01:44:49,829 --> 01:44:52,789
"A shining star at the end of the path."
It has to be.

1238
01:44:52,789 --> 01:44:54,829
It's not here.

1239
01:44:54,829 --> 01:44:56,999
- What did the poem say?
- Nothing.

1240
01:44:56,999 --> 01:44:58,300
Nothing. It's all over.

1241
01:44:58,300 --> 01:45:02,220
It was just the four lines, each
one describing the....

1242
01:45:11,510 --> 01:45:13,060
There is a fifth brand.

1243
01:45:13,430 --> 01:45:15,809
It's not an ambigram.
It's just two crossed keys.

1244
01:45:15,809 --> 01:45:18,900
- The symbol for the Vatican.
- No.

1245
01:45:19,440 --> 01:45:21,019
No, the papacy.

1246
01:45:21,019 --> 01:45:22,609
They intend to kill him.

1247
01:45:22,609 --> 01:45:25,399
Before they destroy the Vatican,
they are......

1248
01:45:25,399 --> 01:45:27,029
...going to kill and brand the Pope himself.

1249
01:45:27,029 --> 01:45:28,199
There is no Pope.

1250
01:45:28,199 --> 01:45:29,989
Tempe Sede Vacante.

1251
01:45:29,989 --> 01:45:32,250
The Camerlengo.

1252
01:45:33,870 --> 01:45:36,920
- We have to warn him.
- Take a step back, please.

1253
01:45:37,750 --> 01:45:40,590
Take your cell phone from your pocket.

1254
01:45:43,550 --> 01:45:45,350
Throw it in the fire.

1255
01:45:56,180 --> 01:45:57,769
Murderer.

1256
01:45:57,769 --> 01:46:00,559
You know, when they call me...

1257
01:46:00,559 --> 01:46:02,240
...and they all call me...

1258
01:46:02,560 --> 01:46:05,029
...it is so important to them that....

1259
01:46:05,029 --> 01:46:07,939
...I know that what they ask is the Lord's will.

1260
01:46:07,939 --> 01:46:11,290
Or Allah's, Or Yahweh's.

1261
01:46:12,410 --> 01:46:14,630
And I suppose they are right.

1262
01:46:18,710 --> 01:46:20,799
Because if he was not vengeful,

1263
01:46:20,799 --> 01:46:22,680
I would not exist, now, would I?

1264
01:46:23,170 --> 01:46:25,919
I have had several chances
to eliminate you tonight.

1265
01:46:25,919 --> 01:46:28,299
You are still alive because you
have no weapon.

1266
01:46:28,299 --> 01:46:29,559
...And they didn't ask me to kill you,

1267
01:46:29,559 --> 01:46:31,549
But if you pursue me...

1268
01:46:31,549 --> 01:46:33,980
...it is another matter.

1269
01:46:40,390 --> 01:46:41,990
Be careful.

1270
01:46:42,270 --> 01:46:44,700
These are men of God.

1271
01:46:56,900 --> 01:46:58,950
The Camerlengo.

1272
01:47:19,260 --> 01:47:21,850
- Camerlengo will grant you audience.
- Good.

1273
01:47:21,850 --> 01:47:24,140
I would like to see him alone.

1274
01:47:25,720 --> 01:47:26,959
That's impossible sir.

1275
01:47:26,959 --> 01:47:29,059
No one sees the camerlengo alone.

1276
01:47:29,059 --> 01:47:31,570
Have you forgotten who you are working for?

1277
01:47:33,060 --> 01:47:35,820
- No, sir.
- Good.

1278
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:01,390
Have you come to make me a martyr?

1279
01:48:08,340 --> 01:48:11,230
Here. Here. Here.

1280
01:49:37,720 --> 01:49:40,269
- I need to see the Camerlengo.
- He is not available.

1281
01:49:40,269 --> 01:49:43,490
- I demand to see the Camerlengo.
- He is not available.

1282
01:49:43,980 --> 01:49:45,950
We will see about that.

1283
01:49:55,070 --> 01:49:58,119
All locked up. Senza chiave.
It's a one way portal.

1284
01:49:58,119 --> 01:50:00,539
The only entrance is on the other side.

1285
01:50:00,539 --> 01:50:02,499
- No. Hey!

1286
01:50:03,420 --> 01:50:08,930
I don't care who he talks to. Open the door.
He doesn't go into that room. Open the door.

1287
01:50:10,670 --> 01:50:14,140
This is Robert Langdon and Dr. Vetra.
Open the door!

1288
01:50:15,800 --> 01:50:17,270
Open up!

1289
01:50:20,850 --> 01:50:22,429
Open the door!

1290
01:50:22,429 --> 01:50:23,429
Hey!

1291
01:50:27,400 --> 01:50:29,700
The Camerlengo is in danger.

1292
01:50:43,160 --> 01:50:45,300
He is the one. He has got a gun.

1293
01:50:49,500 --> 01:50:51,379
- illuminatus!
- You bastard.

1294
01:50:51,379 --> 01:50:54,350
- illuminatus!
- Sanctimonious bastard!

1295
01:51:02,680 --> 01:51:05,269
- Padre.
- Order the evacuation.

1296
01:51:05,269 --> 01:51:07,360
We only have 19 minutes.

1297
01:51:11,400 --> 01:51:13,250
Here. He is...

1298
01:51:13,250 --> 01:51:15,489
......and get the helicopter for the
older cardinals, right.

1299
01:51:15,489 --> 01:51:17,160
Yes, sir.

1300
01:51:29,880 --> 01:51:31,379
Robert?

1301
01:51:31,379 --> 01:51:32,700
The brand, the symbol....

1302
01:51:32,700 --> 01:51:34,970
......could it have another meaning?

1303
01:51:40,680 --> 01:51:43,730
Crossed keys, but those were upside down.

1304
01:51:44,060 --> 01:51:45,860
St. Peter.

1305
01:51:46,770 --> 01:51:48,820
The first Pope...

1306
01:51:49,400 --> 01:51:51,269
...was crucified upside down.

1307
01:51:51,269 --> 01:51:53,979
- On Vatican Hill.
- A few hundred feet below us.

1308
01:51:53,979 --> 01:51:55,489
Necropolis. City of the dead.

1309
01:51:55,489 --> 01:51:58,069
"Upon this rock, I will build my church. "

1310
01:51:58,069 --> 01:52:01,250
"Or bring it down upon itself. "

1311
01:52:01,830 --> 01:52:05,130
The bomb is in St. Peter's tomb.

1312
01:52:20,010 --> 01:52:21,679
The grid is still cycling.

1313
01:52:21,679 --> 01:52:24,360
The power to this section must be down.

1314
01:53:22,400 --> 01:53:25,540
It must be here. It must be.

1315
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:38,380
Don't touch it.

1316
01:53:39,600 --> 01:53:41,990
We have seven minutes.

1317
01:53:47,150 --> 01:53:49,790
Robert, hold this.

1318
01:54:30,570 --> 01:54:32,739
It's cold down here, isn't it?

1319
01:54:32,739 --> 01:54:34,370
What's wrong?

1320
01:54:34,660 --> 01:54:37,330
Cold decreases battery life.

1321
01:54:39,160 --> 01:54:41,300
We may have less than five minutes.

1322
01:54:41,660 --> 01:54:42,410
So?

1323
01:54:43,170 --> 01:54:45,919
If I pull the power with less than five minutes...

1324
01:54:45,919 --> 01:54:48,760
...the residual charge won't hold suspension.

1325
01:54:50,340 --> 01:54:53,469
We should leave it here and get clear if we can.

1326
01:54:53,469 --> 01:54:55,849
- At least down here the damage....
- No!

1327
01:54:55,849 --> 01:54:58,310
- No. Wait!
- Father!

1328
01:55:00,430 --> 01:55:02,519
We are live here at St. Peter's Square...

1329
01:55:02,519 --> 01:55:06,189
where, despite a bomb threat,
and an order of evacuation...

1330
01:55:06,189 --> 01:55:09,939
...the crowd is actually growing in size
As we await an official...

1331
01:55:09,939 --> 01:55:12,029
...announcement from
the Vatican spokesman...

1332
01:55:12,029 --> 01:55:14,199
...as to the exact nature of the threat...

1333
01:55:14,199 --> 01:55:18,080
...and whether or not, they
are treating it as a credible danger.

1334
01:55:25,420 --> 01:55:26,930
This way.

1335
01:55:57,450 --> 01:56:01,670
[SPEAKS IN ITALIAN]
A bomb?

1336
01:56:06,080 --> 01:56:10,220
Roberto, there is an emergency.
I will take her up alone.

1337
01:56:14,010 --> 01:56:16,060
He has got clearance.

1338
01:56:40,990 --> 01:56:43,210
Oh, my God.

1339
01:58:44,450 --> 01:58:46,120
Get down!

1340
02:01:38,620 --> 02:01:40,999
Cardinal Strauss?

1341
02:01:40,999 --> 02:01:45,089
It was the Camerlengo.
He has saved us all.

1342
02:01:45,089 --> 02:01:49,350
He has saved the Church
and he is still alive.

1343
02:01:50,010 --> 02:01:51,890
Praise God. Praise God.

1344
02:01:57,350 --> 02:01:58,929
He is alive.

1345
02:01:58,929 --> 02:02:02,740
- He sacrificed himself for all of us.
- He is alive.

1346
02:02:09,929 --> 02:02:12,999
It's so incredible. He survived.

1347
02:02:30,510 --> 02:02:34,639
You know, the worst thing
we thought would happen?

1348
02:02:34,639 --> 02:02:38,940
Was that our work would fall into
the hands of the energy companies.

1349
02:02:40,850 --> 02:02:43,450
We thought we could change the world.

1350
02:02:43,690 --> 02:02:45,059
So naive.

1351
02:02:45,059 --> 02:02:48,859
No, no. Not naive.

1352
02:02:48,859 --> 02:02:50,859
Innocent, maybe.

1353
02:02:50,859 --> 02:02:53,460
But it's not a crime.

1354
02:02:54,530 --> 02:02:56,960
I am not so sure.

1355
02:02:58,240 --> 02:03:01,050
Go back to work.

1356
02:03:01,660 --> 02:03:04,050
Change the world.

1357
02:03:22,680 --> 02:03:25,899
A gift, uh, do you understand
what I am saying?

1358
02:03:25,899 --> 02:03:28,899
For Catholics, for everyone.

1359
02:03:28,899 --> 02:03:32,799
The Camerlengo's age should not be
an obstacle. Signore........

1360
02:03:32,799 --> 02:03:34,029
Signori...

1361
02:03:34,029 --> 02:03:38,869
.......you are no doubt aware that by "Holy Law"
the man is ineligible for election to the papacy.

1362
02:03:38,869 --> 02:03:40,909
He is not a cardinal. He is a priest.

1363
02:03:40,909 --> 02:03:42,789
He is of insufficient age.

1364
02:03:42,789 --> 02:03:46,099
Or maybe there is a way we could
consider the possibilities. Yes.

1365
02:03:46,099 --> 02:03:50,879
I am sorry. The protocols of conclave
are not subject to modification.

1366
02:03:50,879 --> 02:03:52,969
I will not call a ballot on this matter.

1367
02:03:52,969 --> 02:03:55,969
But, signore, you would not call the ballot.

1368
02:03:55,969 --> 02:03:57,429
Surely, you remember?

1369
02:03:57,429 --> 02:04:00,389
You gave up your post as Great Elector.

1370
02:04:00,389 --> 02:04:02,719
They are singing at St. Peter's Square.

1371
02:04:02,719 --> 02:04:05,599
And what happened here tonight
transcends our laws.

1372
02:04:05,599 --> 02:04:06,809
Has it?

1373
02:04:06,809 --> 02:04:10,109
Is it God's will that we give
ourselves over to frenzy?

1374
02:04:10,109 --> 02:04:11,899
Discard the rules of the Church?

1375
02:04:11,899 --> 02:04:14,790
Perhaps we need not discard them.

1376
02:04:15,280 --> 02:04:21,250
Signori, I am thinking now of Romano
Pontifici Eligendo numero Sessanta...

1377
02:04:21,250 --> 02:04:24,550
- Acclamation by Adoration.
- Exactly, signore. Exactly. Yes.

1378
02:04:24,550 --> 02:04:27,829
If the Holy Spirit speaks through us...

1379
02:04:27,829 --> 02:04:30,379
and we call a man's name out loud...

1380
02:04:30,379 --> 02:04:33,169
That is election by adoration. Yes.

1381
02:04:33,169 --> 02:04:35,759
He is God's choice. Yes.

1382
02:04:35,759 --> 02:04:40,929
And the candidate need only be an
ordained member of the clergy.....

1383
02:04:40,929 --> 02:04:45,940
...present in the Sistine Chapel at
the moment of his election.

1384
02:04:53,690 --> 02:04:55,690
"I think we have it settled."

1385
02:05:18,880 --> 02:05:20,390
Signor Camerlengo?

1386
02:05:20,720 --> 02:05:21,929
Yes?

1387
02:05:21,929 --> 02:05:26,139
The cardinals ask you to join them in
conclave as soon as possible.

1388
02:05:26,139 --> 02:05:26,889
Me?

1389
02:05:27,520 --> 02:05:29,900
Yes, Padre.

1390
02:05:52,170 --> 02:05:53,499
What are you doing?

1391
02:05:53,499 --> 02:05:56,890
Silvano's journals. I want them back.

1392
02:06:21,030 --> 02:06:23,330
Richter said...

1393
02:06:24,200 --> 02:06:26,369
"His Holiness" suffered from seizures...

1394
02:06:26,369 --> 02:06:29,000
...and steps were taken...

1395
02:06:29,830 --> 02:06:31,800
...for safety.

1396
02:06:35,880 --> 02:06:39,180
"Made sure he was watched", he said.

1397
02:06:40,380 --> 02:06:44,350
What if he was trying to give me this key?

1398
02:06:44,720 --> 02:06:47,259
That's the Papal office.

1399
02:06:47,259 --> 02:06:49,309
If the Pope was worried about seizures,

1400
02:06:49,309 --> 02:06:52,559
...he must have had Richter install cameras
without telling anyone.

1401
02:06:52,559 --> 02:06:55,530
To keep an eye on him for his safety.

1402
02:06:57,070 --> 02:06:59,120
Maybe it records.

1403
02:07:09,830 --> 02:07:11,709
I read the journals, Patrick.

1404
02:07:11,709 --> 02:07:14,459
The scientist kept journals. So?

1405
02:07:14,459 --> 02:07:16,470
Oh! You figure prominently in them.

1406
02:07:16,880 --> 02:07:18,089
Really?

1407
02:07:18,089 --> 02:07:22,810
The Devoli wasn't just a physicist.
He was also a Catholic priest.

1408
02:07:23,090 --> 02:07:27,459
And as such, he was deeply conflicted
about the implications of his work.....

1409
02:07:27,459 --> 02:07:29,929
.....and in need of spiritual guidance.

1410
02:07:29,929 --> 02:07:32,070
Like Galileo.

1411
02:07:32,730 --> 02:07:36,149
About a month ago...
he requested an audience with the Pope.

1412
02:07:36,149 --> 02:07:38,019
But you know that.

1413
02:07:38,019 --> 02:07:41,439
Because you granted the audience
and you were also present during it.

1414
02:07:41,439 --> 02:07:42,609
The 'God Particle'.

1415
02:07:42,609 --> 02:07:46,619
To actually claim an act of creation.
The blasphemy. The arrogance.

1416
02:07:46,619 --> 02:07:49,369
The Holy Father didn't see it like that.

1417
02:07:49,369 --> 02:07:51,449
He urged him to go public.

1418
02:07:51,449 --> 02:07:53,539
"His Holiness" thought that the discovery......

1419
02:07:53,539 --> 02:07:57,749
......could actually scientifically prove
the existence of a divine power.

1420
02:07:57,749 --> 02:08:00,919
And begin to bridge the gap
between science and religion.

1421
02:08:00,919 --> 02:08:03,799
His work was not religious.
It was sacrilegious.

1422
02:08:03,799 --> 02:08:08,980
But you... You saw the Pope's position
as a softening of church law.

1423
02:08:09,470 --> 02:08:13,400
As an old man's weakness.
Your father's weakness.

1424
02:08:13,770 --> 02:08:15,799
You murdered the Vicar of Christ.

1425
02:08:15,799 --> 02:08:19,649
He raised me to protect this Church...
even from within.

1426
02:08:19,649 --> 02:08:25,820
And then......then you conjured up an old
enemy from the past. The illuminati.

1427
02:08:25,820 --> 02:08:30,119
You found the ancient brands in the papal
vaults and put them to use...

1428
02:08:30,119 --> 02:08:31,329
...to spread fear.

1429
02:08:31,329 --> 02:08:33,909
The Cardinals are men of belief.

1430
02:08:33,909 --> 02:08:37,579
Right now,
their belief in evil is uniting them.

1431
02:08:37,579 --> 02:08:40,919
The entire Catholic world
will be united by this attack.

1432
02:08:40,919 --> 02:08:43,140
There is no attack.

1433
02:08:43,840 --> 02:08:46,799
You are trying to convince
the Cardinals they are in a war...

1434
02:08:46,799 --> 02:08:49,049
...so they will choose a warrior
to lead them.

1435
02:08:49,049 --> 02:08:50,349
We are at war.

1436
02:08:50,349 --> 02:08:52,469
We are weak when we should be strong.

1437
02:08:52,469 --> 02:08:56,479
If science is allowed to claim
the power of creation...

1438
02:08:56,479 --> 02:08:58,349
...what is left for God?

1439
02:08:58,349 --> 02:09:00,320
It didn't work, Patrick.

1440
02:09:01,520 --> 02:09:05,200
- It isn't finished.
- Oh, yes, it's finished.

1441
02:09:06,110 --> 02:09:08,330
It's finished.

1442
02:09:09,030 --> 02:09:12,029
I have shown the journals to Father Simeon.

1443
02:09:12,029 --> 02:09:14,489
The moment the doors to the Conclave open......

1444
02:09:14,489 --> 02:09:17,710
...he will tell the Cardinals what you have done.

1445
02:09:17,960 --> 02:09:20,760
I was planning on doing this alone.

1446
02:09:23,380 --> 02:09:25,100
Put it down.

1447
02:09:27,470 --> 02:09:30,389
But, perhaps, it's better that you are here.

1448
02:09:30,389 --> 02:09:31,810
Put it down.

1449
02:09:33,350 --> 02:09:35,440
Put it away.

1450
02:09:47,490 --> 02:09:50,790
Help. He is the one. He has got a gun.

1451
02:09:54,330 --> 02:09:56,749
- illuminatus.
- You bastard.

1452
02:09:56,749 --> 02:09:59,590
- illuminatus!
- Sanctimonious bastard!

1453
02:10:03,600 --> 02:10:04,320
Padre.

1454
02:10:14,680 --> 02:10:18,199
And get the helicopter
for the older cardinals, right? Yes Sir.

1455
02:10:21,499 --> 02:10:25,299
Robert, The brand, the symbol,
could it have another meaning?

1456
02:11:08,940 --> 02:11:12,200
I have been summoned
by the College of Cardinals.

1457
02:12:25,350 --> 02:12:26,809
Gently.

1458
02:12:26,809 --> 02:12:31,350
But within our walls.

1459
02:12:40,940 --> 02:12:43,130
He's on your side.

1460
02:13:32,060 --> 02:13:36,080
Father,
into "thy" hands I commend my spirit.

1461
02:14:29,490 --> 02:14:31,499
Church sources now confirm that....

1462
02:14:31,499 --> 02:14:33,749
....Carmelengo, Father Patrick McKenna...

1463
02:14:33,749 --> 02:14:38,709
...has died of internal injuries
sustained in his heroic fall...

1464
02:14:38,709 --> 02:14:40,999
The Catholic church thanks Camerlengo...

1465
02:14:40,999 --> 02:14:45,169
...for his selfless act
and demands his immediate canonization.

1466
02:14:45,169 --> 02:14:49,009
The Vatican has also confirmed
the deaths of three Cardinals...

1467
02:14:49,009 --> 02:14:51,679
...and the fire in the Santa Maria
della Vittoria.

1468
02:14:51,679 --> 02:14:54,349
As we await the appearance of the
new Holy Father...

1469
02:14:54,349 --> 02:14:56,139
Cardinal Baggia of Italy...

1470
02:14:56,139 --> 02:14:58,299
...one of the four original Preferiti...

1471
02:14:58,299 --> 02:15:00,550
..who, despite terrorist attempts at disruption...

1472
02:15:00,550 --> 02:15:04,819
...seems to have been selected in one of
the swiftest and smoothest conclaves...

1473
02:15:04,819 --> 02:15:06,910
...in modern church history.

1474
02:15:13,580 --> 02:15:15,800
Professor Langdon? Please.

1475
02:15:32,930 --> 02:15:36,429
A token of thanks from "His Holiness"

1476
02:15:36,429 --> 02:15:39,820
and from his new Camerlengo.

1477
02:15:40,770 --> 02:15:43,729
We are grateful you saved his life.

1478
02:15:43,729 --> 02:15:47,149
And it's our understanding
that you require this text...

1479
02:15:47,149 --> 02:15:49,500
...to complete your scholarly work.

1480
02:15:51,240 --> 02:15:54,529
We ask only that in your last will and testament...

1481
02:15:54,529 --> 02:15:56,989
...you ensure...

1482
02:15:56,989 --> 02:15:59,210
...it finds its way home.

1483
02:16:01,670 --> 02:16:02,919
Of course.

1484
02:16:02,919 --> 02:16:05,289
And when you write of us...

1485
02:16:05,289 --> 02:16:08,259
...and you will write of us...

1486
02:16:08,259 --> 02:16:10,719
...may I ask one thing?

1487
02:16:10,719 --> 02:16:12,600
Do so gently.

1488
02:16:14,800 --> 02:16:16,469
I will try.

1489
02:16:16,469 --> 02:16:18,610
Religion is flawed...

1490
02:16:18,980 --> 02:16:21,979
...but only because man is flawed.

1491
02:16:21,979 --> 02:16:25,700
All men, including this one.

1492
02:16:40,000 --> 02:16:42,130
He chose the name Luke.

1493
02:16:44,790 --> 02:16:47,800
There's been many Marks and Johns.

1494
02:16:49,170 --> 02:16:51,060
Never a Luke.

1495
02:16:51,470 --> 02:16:53,140
It's said he was a doctor.

1496
02:16:54,180 --> 02:16:58,349
It's quite a message.
Science and faith, all in one.

1497
02:16:58,349 --> 02:17:00,270
The world is in need of both.

1498
02:17:02,850 --> 02:17:05,570
You will counsel him wisely.

1499
02:17:05,570 --> 02:17:09,490
I am an old man. I will counsel him briefly.

1500
02:17:14,820 --> 02:17:17,170
Mr. Langdon.

1501
02:17:22,040 --> 02:17:26,970
Thanks be to God for sending
someone to protect this church.

1502
02:17:30,880 --> 02:17:33,719
I don't believe "He" sent me, Father.

1503
02:17:33,719 --> 02:17:36,179
Oh, my son.

1504
02:17:36,179 --> 02:17:38,520
Of course "He" did.
