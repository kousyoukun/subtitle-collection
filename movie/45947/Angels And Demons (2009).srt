<i>The Ring of the Fisherman,
which bears the official papal seal</i>

2
00:02:18,699 --> 00:02:22,702
<i>must be destroyed immediately
following the pope's death.</i>

3
00:02:23,371 --> 00:02:27,582
<i>The papal apartment is then sealed
for nine days of mourning</i>

4
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:30,377
<i>a period known as
sede vacante:</i>

5
00:02:30,545 --> 00:02:33,131
<i>The time of the empty throne.</i>

6
00:02:35,342 --> 00:02:36,926
<i>Over the last several days</i>

7
00:02:37,094 --> 00:02:40,096
<i>Catholic leaders from every corner
of the world</i>

8
00:02:40,264 --> 00:02:43,982
<i>have flocked to Rome
shocked by the sudden death</i>

9
00:02:44,018 --> 00:02:47,395
<i>of this progressive
and beloved pope.</i>

10
00:02:54,194 --> 00:02:56,612
<i>Today, in St. Peter's Square</i>

11
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:59,198
<i>the faithful pray
that there is among them</i>

12
00:02:59,366 --> 00:03:01,909
<i>another leader
who can unite their Church</i>

13
00:03:02,077 --> 00:03:06,038
<i>which has been so riven by change
and dissent in recent years.</i>

14
00:03:10,211 --> 00:03:12,963
<i>As the body of the pontiff
passes by</i>

15
00:03:13,131 --> 00:03:16,425
<i>we see prayers are being offered

16
00:03:16,593 --> 00:03:18,802
<i>favorites among those
being considered</i>

17
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:22,890
<i>to succeed him
as the Vicar of Christ.</i>

18
00:03:32,192 --> 00:03:35,277
<i>At the end of the mourning period,
the College of Cardinals</i>

19
00:03:35,445 --> 00:03:39,907
<i>will lock itself behind the doors
of the Sistine Chapel for conclave</i>

20
00:03:40,074 --> 00:03:43,327
<i>the process by which they
will choose a new leader...</i>

21
00:03:43,495 --> 00:03:46,121
<i>for the world's
one billion Catholics</i>

22
00:03:46,289 --> 00:03:49,083
<i>who now find their Church

23
00:03:49,251 --> 00:03:53,171
<i>its ancient traditions threatened

24
00:03:59,637 --> 00:04:04,891
Attention, control group going online
for LHC beam event.

25
00:04:05,351 --> 00:04:07,268
We are powering up.

26
00:04:10,773 --> 00:04:13,358
Attention, Category one personnel:

27
00:04:13,526 --> 00:04:16,945
Interlock areas are now restricted.

28
00:04:17,863 --> 00:04:20,406
You pulled us off the power grid,
Philippe.

29
00:04:20,616 --> 00:04:23,243
Because you're scaring the hell
out of everyone.

30
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:26,956
The collider was never intended
to generate antimatter.

31
00:04:27,165 --> 00:04:30,501
All three canisters are stored
under every possible safeguard.

32
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:33,212
I'm only asking you to wait.

33
00:04:33,547 --> 00:04:37,591
We can't wait. The bulk of the
antimatter is generated at start-up.

34
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:39,093
Put us back online.

35
00:04:39,803 --> 00:04:42,930
Do you want to call the director,
or shall I?

36
00:04:43,098 --> 00:04:46,684
ATLAS underground
is now in restricted mode.

37
00:04:46,893 --> 00:04:48,310
Vittoria, Vittoria.

38
00:04:48,478 --> 00:04:50,146
Protons are being loaded.

39
00:04:50,438 --> 00:04:52,982
Don't blow us all to heaven.

40
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:54,316
Please.

41
00:04:54,484 --> 00:04:57,445
Powering on LHC magnets.

42
00:04:58,697 --> 00:05:02,325
lon source stage
in four three, two.

43
00:05:02,493 --> 00:05:04,202
We are powering up. Here we go.

44
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:06,246
Start the collision sequence.

45
00:05:06,414 --> 00:05:09,249
Vittoria what did Philippe want?

46
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:13,837
They're terrified. He wants us to wait.
What do you think?

47
00:05:14,172 --> 00:05:19,342
I think if we don't harvest now,
we never will.

48
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:22,095
Beam-on-beam stability is good.
Take your places, people.

49
00:05:22,263 --> 00:05:24,139
ATLAS at CMS check.

50
00:05:24,307 --> 00:05:28,143
Sending timing trigger now.
Collisions imminent.

51
00:05:28,978 --> 00:05:31,688
We have got 10 to the 13th protons
per bunch.

52
00:05:32,648 --> 00:05:35,358
Let's hope the heavy ion guys
didn't mess up.

53
00:05:35,526 --> 00:05:38,528
Beams at relativistic velocities.

54
00:05:39,615 --> 00:05:42,158
Luminosity monitors operational.

55
00:05:42,326 --> 00:05:44,535
Beamline has no restrictions.

56
00:05:44,703 --> 00:05:46,496
Enable beam capture.

57
00:05:46,663 --> 00:05:48,873
Accelerating the beam.

58
00:05:49,041 --> 00:05:50,875
Stage one, line up.

59
00:05:51,043 --> 00:05:52,668
Magnets to full field.

60
00:05:52,836 --> 00:05:54,462
Load functions to magnets.

61
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:56,547
Last P is still too high.

62
00:05:56,715 --> 00:05:59,801
Yeah, we got luminosity of 10 to 34.

63
00:06:00,552 --> 00:06:02,678
Inject particle beams.

64
00:06:04,056 --> 00:06:05,556
Filling the LHC.

65
00:06:07,559 --> 00:06:10,061
Collisions are active.
We should be back online.

66
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:13,064
Capture should begin
at any moment.

67
00:06:13,232 --> 00:06:15,691
Particles in transition.

68
00:06:18,071 --> 00:06:22,241
Collisions are fixed and running.

69
00:06:22,408 --> 00:06:25,661
LHC injecting protons,
beam one.

70
00:06:28,248 --> 00:06:29,915
Lock the feedback systems.

71
00:06:30,083 --> 00:06:33,752
Particles at 99 percent
the speed of light.

72
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,963
Colliding stable beams.

73
00:06:36,631 --> 00:06:38,632
Enact injection kicker.

74
00:06:41,094 --> 00:06:43,971
We have a signal
on the luminosity monitors.

75
00:06:44,139 --> 00:06:46,265
We have events.

76
00:06:51,896 --> 00:06:53,647
Protons are moving.

77
00:07:13,252 --> 00:07:16,254
We have antimatter.

78
00:07:19,967 --> 00:07:23,803
It's on a scale never seen before.

79
00:07:24,305 --> 00:07:26,890
That's a crate of beer on the way.

80
00:07:31,103 --> 00:07:34,273
Silvano we've done it.

81
00:07:39,821 --> 00:07:43,657
We're in God's hands now, Vittoria.

82
00:07:44,326 --> 00:07:46,619
I'll be right down.

83
00:08:46,305 --> 00:08:49,725
Silvano.

84
00:09:12,416 --> 00:09:14,709
Oh, God.

85
00:09:15,294 --> 00:09:17,003
Help!

86
00:10:18,275 --> 00:10:21,152
A swim might help
your jet lag.

87
00:10:21,737 --> 00:10:22,987
I beg your pardon?

88
00:10:23,155 --> 00:10:26,116
You got bags under your eyes.
It's 5 in the morning.

89
00:10:26,283 --> 00:10:28,076
And you're from the Vatican.

90
00:10:29,829 --> 00:10:31,412
Crossed keys under the triregnum.

91
00:10:32,123 --> 00:10:33,915
It's a papal symbol.

92
00:10:36,961 --> 00:10:40,589
Claudio Vincenzi,
Corpo della Gendarmeria Vaticano.

93
00:10:41,508 --> 00:10:43,134
Vatican police?

94
00:10:44,761 --> 00:10:46,512
I was expecting another letter.

95
00:10:48,598 --> 00:10:51,767
My request for access
to your archives.

96
00:10:52,435 --> 00:10:54,103
Shouldn't you be in Rome?

97
00:10:54,271 --> 00:10:56,313
A kind of busy time for you guys,
isn't it?

98
00:10:56,481 --> 00:10:59,608
In fact, I was in New York,
detailed to the U.N.

99
00:10:59,776 --> 00:11:02,027
I receive a phone call
in the middle of the night:

100
00:11:02,195 --> 00:11:04,697
"Find Professor Robert Langdon.

101
00:11:04,865 --> 00:11:07,533
A matter of great urgency."

102
00:11:07,701 --> 00:11:11,787
They said to show you this.

103
00:11:24,218 --> 00:11:27,053
The Illuminati? They disappeared
hundreds of years ago.

104
00:11:27,221 --> 00:11:28,889
Did they? Look at that again.

105
00:11:29,056 --> 00:11:30,140
It's an ambigram.

106
00:11:30,308 --> 00:11:32,392
It's the same image
forward and backward.

107
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:35,729
Now, that's common for a symbol,
like a yin and yang or a swastika...

108
00:11:35,897 --> 00:11:37,147
but that's a word.

109
00:11:37,315 --> 00:11:39,232
That Illuminati
ambigramatic symbol...

110
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:42,235
has been considered a myth
for 400 years.

111
00:11:42,403 --> 00:11:44,029
Supposedly, in the 16th century

112
00:11:44,197 --> 00:11:48,200
some artist created it as a tribute
to Galileo's love of symmetry.

113
00:11:48,367 --> 00:11:49,826
It was only gonna be revealed

114
00:11:49,994 --> 00:11:52,245
when the Illuminati
had amassed enough power

115
00:11:52,413 --> 00:11:54,582
to resurface and carry out
their final goal.

116
00:11:54,792 --> 00:11:56,042
I wrote a book about it.

117
00:11:57,252 --> 00:11:58,586
Which is why you're here.

118
00:11:58,796 --> 00:12:00,922
The Art of the Illuminati
by Robert Langdon.

119
00:12:01,089 --> 00:12:02,423
Part one.

120
00:12:02,591 --> 00:12:05,551
Haven't been able to finish Part Two.
I'm not allowed access

121
00:12:05,719 --> 00:12:07,428
to your archives.

122
00:12:12,768 --> 00:12:15,269
It's remarkable. Singular.

123
00:12:15,437 --> 00:12:17,271
Someone is trying
to make you believe

124
00:12:17,439 --> 00:12:19,774
the Illuminati themselves
have returned to Rome.

125
00:12:19,942 --> 00:12:22,401
Right after the death of a pope.

126
00:12:26,156 --> 00:12:28,908
Four cardinals were kidnapped
from inside the Vatican

127
00:12:29,076 --> 00:12:31,995
sometime between 3 and 5 am.
This morning.

128
00:12:32,163 --> 00:12:33,872
Shortly afterward

129
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:36,959
that document was sent
to the office of the Swiss Guard

130
00:12:37,127 --> 00:12:40,754
along with the threat the cardinals
will be publicly executed...

131
00:12:40,922 --> 00:12:44,591
one per hour, beginning at 8 pm.
Tonight in Rome.

132
00:12:55,562 --> 00:12:57,563
- Conclave.
- Was to begin today.

133
00:12:57,730 --> 00:13:01,066
We've postponed its start
for a few hours, a story of illness.

134
00:13:01,234 --> 00:13:03,443
There are no suspicions yet.

135
00:13:04,571 --> 00:13:06,071
What do you want from me?

136
00:13:07,115 --> 00:13:10,577
These criminals
who sent this ambigram

137
00:13:10,744 --> 00:13:13,580
meant it as a taunt, a provocation.

138
00:13:13,747 --> 00:13:17,417
But Captain Olivetti think if you can
use it to learn their identity...

139
00:13:17,585 --> 00:13:20,670
perhaps we can stop
this abomination.

140
00:13:24,758 --> 00:13:26,134
Why me?

141
00:13:26,969 --> 00:13:29,929
Your expertise. Your erudition.

142
00:13:30,473 --> 00:13:34,767
Your recent involvement
with certain Church, shall we say

143
00:13:35,561 --> 00:13:36,644
mysteries.

144
00:13:37,521 --> 00:13:39,606
I wasn't under the impression
that episode

145
00:13:39,773 --> 00:13:41,774
had endeared me to the Vatican.

146
00:13:41,942 --> 00:13:43,151
Oh, it didn't.

147
00:13:43,611 --> 00:13:46,280
But it did make you...
What's the word?

148
00:13:46,448 --> 00:13:48,240
Formidabile.

149
00:13:49,201 --> 00:13:50,326
Formidable.

150
00:13:51,912 --> 00:13:54,455
A Vatican jet is standing by
20 minutes from here.

151
00:13:54,623 --> 00:13:55,790
Will you come with me?

152
00:14:04,132 --> 00:14:06,342
Professore Langdon,
you've spent your life

153
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:09,720
searching for symbols like the one
you now hold in your hand.

154
00:14:10,305 --> 00:14:12,181
How much longer are we
going to pretend

155
00:14:12,349 --> 00:14:14,683
you have not already
decided to come?

156
00:14:21,358 --> 00:14:24,528
If the Illuminati have returned
and are in Rome...

157
00:14:24,695 --> 00:14:27,823
we will hunt them down
and kill them.

158
00:14:28,991 --> 00:14:30,909
The Illuminati
did not become violent

159
00:14:31,077 --> 00:14:34,204
until the 17th century. Their name
means "the enlightened ones"

160
00:14:34,372 --> 00:14:37,374
They were physicists
and mathematicians, astronomers.

161
00:14:37,542 --> 00:14:40,418
They were concerned with
the Church's inaccurate teaching

162
00:14:40,586 --> 00:14:42,546
and were dedicated
to scientific truth.

163
00:14:42,713 --> 00:14:44,256
But the Vatican didn't like that.

164
00:14:44,423 --> 00:14:46,424
So the Church began to...
How did you say it?

165
00:14:46,592 --> 00:14:49,636
Oh, "hunt them down and kill them"

166
00:14:49,804 --> 00:14:51,388
Drove them underground.

167
00:14:52,849 --> 00:14:54,975
Into a secret society.

168
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:57,414
Excuse me.

169
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:07,800
Comandante Richter assures me
the guard

170
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:11,386
is doing everything humanly possible
to find the preferiti.

171
00:16:11,554 --> 00:16:14,473
A long way to say very little.

172
00:16:15,851 --> 00:16:18,228
What if you were to begin
in their absence?

173
00:16:18,395 --> 00:16:20,146
They are the four leading candidates.

174
00:16:20,314 --> 00:16:22,482
If they're not present,
they're not eligible.

175
00:16:22,650 --> 00:16:27,946
There will be no consensus without
them. Who are we to vote for?

176
00:16:30,574 --> 00:16:35,161
It is as much a sin to offer flattery
as to accept it.

177
00:16:35,329 --> 00:16:38,122
May I suggest you at least consider
the possibility.

178
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:39,958
No, no, no. There is no possibility.

179
00:16:40,126 --> 00:16:44,796
I have been chosen Great Elector.
I am not eligible.

180
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:51,052
Camerlengo asks how long we can
postpone the opening prayer

181
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:53,931
without making another
announcement to the public.

182
00:16:54,099 --> 00:16:58,644
Tell the camerlengo the cardinal-elect
will take every minute required

183
00:16:58,937 --> 00:17:02,064
to perform the sacred trust.

184
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:05,734
No further announcements
are necessary.

185
00:17:07,529 --> 00:17:10,322
He'll be concerned
about the public dimension.

186
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:14,118
- People will think...
- What we tell them to think.

187
00:17:18,206 --> 00:17:19,790
- Professor Langdon.
- Yes.

188
00:17:19,958 --> 00:17:21,834
Welcome to Vatican City.

189
00:17:22,711 --> 00:17:26,005
Ernesto Olivetti, inspector general
of the Vatican police force.

190
00:17:26,214 --> 00:17:28,174
- My pleasure.
- This way, please.

191
00:17:28,341 --> 00:17:31,011
We'll meet in the headquarters
of the Swiss Guard.

192
00:17:31,471 --> 00:17:33,346
I thought you were Swiss Guard.

193
00:17:33,514 --> 00:17:35,182
No, la Gendarmeria.

194
00:17:35,349 --> 00:17:38,935
We are responsible for everything
inside the Vatican walls

195
00:17:39,103 --> 00:17:42,522
with the exception
of the security of His Holiness...

196
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:44,316
- Yeah.
- And the Apostolic Palace.

197
00:17:44,484 --> 00:17:46,026
That is Swiss Guard.

198
00:17:46,277 --> 00:17:49,905
The Roman carabinieri are here
as well in an advisory capacity.

199
00:17:50,072 --> 00:17:51,740
So jurisdictionally, this is.

200
00:17:51,908 --> 00:17:53,783
A goddamn nightmare.

201
00:18:00,625 --> 00:18:03,627
Oh, yes, Pope Pius IX's
great castration.

202
00:18:03,795 --> 00:18:06,755
- I beg your pardon?
- 1857, Pope Pius IX

203
00:18:06,923 --> 00:18:10,468
felt the male form
would inspire lust.

204
00:18:10,636 --> 00:18:12,136
So he took a hammer and chisel

205
00:18:12,304 --> 00:18:14,972
and unmanned hundreds
of these statues.

206
00:18:15,724 --> 00:18:19,060
The plaster fig leaves
were added later.

207
00:18:20,813 --> 00:18:24,732
Are you anti-Catholic,
Professor Langdon?

208
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:28,319
No. I'm anti-vandalism.

209
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:34,450
I urge you to guard your tone here.

210
00:18:34,827 --> 00:18:38,704
The Swiss Guard is a calling,
not a profession

211
00:18:38,872 --> 00:18:43,668
and it encourages
a certain zealotry.

212
00:18:43,836 --> 00:18:45,796
Commander Richter,
the head of the Guard

213
00:18:45,964 --> 00:18:47,631
is a deeply spiritual man

214
00:18:47,799 --> 00:18:50,342
and he was close
to the late pope. Understood?

215
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:53,637
Look, I don't study symbols
because I consider them unimportant.

216
00:18:53,805 --> 00:18:56,140
Ceremony, traditions,
it's how we mark our lives.

217
00:18:56,307 --> 00:18:58,183
I just... I just hope I can help.

218
00:18:58,351 --> 00:18:59,977
So do I.

219
00:19:00,145 --> 00:19:02,563
You were my idea.

220
00:19:14,033 --> 00:19:16,368
Wait here. Please.

221
00:19:18,746 --> 00:19:20,038
Commander?

222
00:19:20,206 --> 00:19:21,540
Commander Richter?

223
00:19:22,459 --> 00:19:24,085
Professor Langdon is here.

224
00:19:24,253 --> 00:19:27,046
Well, we have bigger problems
than that now.

225
00:19:29,508 --> 00:19:31,634
Dr. Vetra?

226
00:19:32,636 --> 00:19:35,555
I'm Commander Richter, comandante
principale of the Swiss Guard.

227
00:19:35,723 --> 00:19:37,015
Thank you for coming.

228
00:19:37,183 --> 00:19:38,725
Hello.

229
00:19:39,477 --> 00:19:41,227
- Professor Langdon.
- Yes.

230
00:19:41,395 --> 00:19:43,897
What a relief,
the symbologist is here.

231
00:19:44,064 --> 00:19:46,065
This way, please, Miss Vetra.

232
00:19:48,152 --> 00:19:49,819
The situation has changed.

233
00:19:49,987 --> 00:19:53,281
We received another threat
from the kidnapper.

234
00:19:53,449 --> 00:19:56,242
The canister was stolen from our lab
around noon yesterday.

235
00:19:56,410 --> 00:19:59,955
The intruder killed my research
partner, Silvano Bentivoglio

236
00:20:00,123 --> 00:20:03,417
and mutilated him
in order to bypass security.

237
00:20:03,585 --> 00:20:05,377
We use retinal scanners.

238
00:20:06,004 --> 00:20:08,047
They cut out his eye.

239
00:20:09,132 --> 00:20:11,592
Is that your stolen canister,
Miss Vetra?

240
00:20:12,552 --> 00:20:14,386
Where is that camera, Number 86?

241
00:20:14,554 --> 00:20:16,180
It's wireless.
It too was stolen.

242
00:20:16,348 --> 00:20:18,182
It could be anywhere
inside the Vatican.

243
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:21,435
That canister contains
an extremely combustible substance.

244
00:20:21,603 --> 00:20:24,480
We need to locate it immediately
or evacuate Vatican City.

245
00:20:24,648 --> 00:20:27,149
I'm quite familiar
with incendiaries, Miss Vetra.

246
00:20:27,317 --> 00:20:29,610
I've never heard of antimatter
being used as such.

247
00:20:29,778 --> 00:20:32,780
Well, it's never been generated
in significant quantities before.

248
00:20:32,948 --> 00:20:35,658
It's a way of studying the origins
of the universe...

249
00:20:35,826 --> 00:20:38,703
to try to isolate what some people
call "the God particle"

250
00:20:38,871 --> 00:20:41,081
But there are implications
for energy research...

251
00:20:41,249 --> 00:20:43,124
"The God particle"?

252
00:20:44,126 --> 00:20:45,961
What we call it isn't important.

253
00:20:46,128 --> 00:20:47,796
It's what gives all matter mass.

254
00:20:47,964 --> 00:20:49,923
The thing without which
we could not exist.

255
00:20:50,091 --> 00:20:52,801
You're talking about
the moment of creation.

256
00:20:52,969 --> 00:20:54,594
Yes. In a way, I am.

257
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:57,722
The antimatter is suspended there...

258
00:20:57,890 --> 00:21:01,476
in an airtight nanocomposite shell
with electromagnets in each end.

259
00:21:01,644 --> 00:21:04,938
If it were to fall out of suspension
and come in contact with matter...

260
00:21:05,106 --> 00:21:07,983
say, the bottom of the canister,
the two opposing forces

261
00:21:08,151 --> 00:21:10,235
would annihilate one another
violently.

262
00:21:10,403 --> 00:21:12,696
And what might cause it
to fall out of suspension?

263
00:21:12,864 --> 00:21:14,282
The battery going dead.

264
00:21:14,449 --> 00:21:17,785
- Which it will, just before midnight.
- What kind of annihilation?

265
00:21:17,953 --> 00:21:20,663
- How violent?
- A cataclysmic event.

266
00:21:21,123 --> 00:21:25,334
A blinding explosion equivalent
to about five kilotons.

267
00:21:25,836 --> 00:21:29,505
Vatican City
will be consumed by light.

268
00:21:31,258 --> 00:21:33,968
Those are the exact words
the kidnapper used.

269
00:21:34,136 --> 00:21:37,555
We will destroy your four pillars.

270
00:21:38,348 --> 00:21:40,391
We will brand your preferiti

271
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:43,895
and sacrifice them
on the altars of science

272
00:21:44,062 --> 00:21:47,023
then bring your church down
upon you.

273
00:21:47,191 --> 00:21:50,693
Vatican City
will be consumed by light.

274
00:21:50,861 --> 00:21:55,032
A shining star at the end
of the Path of Illumination.

275
00:22:00,788 --> 00:22:02,581
It's the ancient Illuminati threat.

276
00:22:02,749 --> 00:22:05,542
Destruction of Vatican City
through light.

277
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:09,421
Four pillars,
there's your kidnapped cardinals.

278
00:22:09,589 --> 00:22:12,424
You didn't tell me they
were the preferiti, the favorites

279
00:22:12,592 --> 00:22:14,384
to be named the next pope.

280
00:22:16,763 --> 00:22:18,764
Play it again.

281
00:22:25,396 --> 00:22:27,981
We will destroy your four pillars.

282
00:22:29,902 --> 00:22:31,361
We will brand your preferiti...

283
00:22:31,529 --> 00:22:33,738
Wait, stop it. Stop it.

284
00:22:34,949 --> 00:22:37,200
"Brand" them.

285
00:22:38,911 --> 00:22:41,371
That's another Illuminati legend.

286
00:22:41,539 --> 00:22:46,918
This one says
that there are a set of five brands

287
00:22:47,086 --> 00:22:48,294
each one an ambigram.

288
00:22:48,462 --> 00:22:51,005
The first four are the fundamental
elements of science:

289
00:22:51,173 --> 00:22:53,258
Earth, air, fire and water.

290
00:22:53,425 --> 00:22:55,927
The fifth, it's a mystery.

291
00:22:58,013 --> 00:23:00,098
Maybe it's this.

292
00:23:00,766 --> 00:23:02,392
He said they'd be killed publicly.

293
00:23:03,018 --> 00:23:04,102
Yes.

294
00:23:04,645 --> 00:23:07,106
Revenge for la purga.

295
00:23:07,774 --> 00:23:08,899
"La purga"?

296
00:23:10,527 --> 00:23:13,904
Oh, jeez, you guys don't even read
your own history, do you?

297
00:23:14,072 --> 00:23:19,076
1668, the Church kidnapped
four Illuminati scientists

298
00:23:19,244 --> 00:23:21,370
and branded each one of them
on the chest

299
00:23:21,538 --> 00:23:23,455
with the symbol of the cross

300
00:23:23,623 --> 00:23:26,208
to purge them of their sins,
and they executed them.

301
00:23:26,376 --> 00:23:28,627
Threw their bodies into the street
as a warning

302
00:23:28,795 --> 00:23:32,423
to others to stop questioning
Church rulings on scientific matters.

303
00:23:32,591 --> 00:23:33,632
They radicalized them.

304
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:36,760
The purga created a darker,
more violent Illuminati

305
00:23:36,928 --> 00:23:39,472
one bent on retribution.

306
00:23:40,307 --> 00:23:42,057
Look how they intend
to finally get it:

307
00:23:42,225 --> 00:23:45,645
Using antimatter, technology,
to destroy the Church.

308
00:23:45,813 --> 00:23:48,106
Science obliterates religion.

309
00:23:49,525 --> 00:23:51,109
Is there any more?

310
00:23:52,653 --> 00:23:56,031
- And sacrifice them
on the altars of science

311
00:23:56,199 --> 00:23:59,075
then bring your church down
upon you.

312
00:23:59,243 --> 00:24:02,704
Vatican City will be consumed
by light.

313
00:24:02,872 --> 00:24:07,125
A shining star at the end
of the Path of Illumination.

314
00:24:07,293 --> 00:24:09,419
"Path of Illumination"

315
00:24:12,548 --> 00:24:14,758
I need access
to the Vatican archives.

316
00:24:16,844 --> 00:24:19,304
Professor, I don't think
this is the appropriate...

317
00:24:19,472 --> 00:24:21,349
Your petition has been denied
seven times.

318
00:24:21,517 --> 00:24:25,019
No, no. This has nothing to do with
my work. The Path of Illumination

319
00:24:25,187 --> 00:24:28,022
is a trail that leads
to the Church of the Illumination

320
00:24:28,190 --> 00:24:31,275
the place where the Illuminati
would meet in secret.

321
00:24:31,443 --> 00:24:33,694
If I can find the segno, the sign

322
00:24:34,488 --> 00:24:38,491
that marks the beginning of that
path, the four churches along it

323
00:24:38,659 --> 00:24:41,410
may be where he intends
to murder your cardinals.

324
00:24:41,578 --> 00:24:44,372
One every hour at 8, 9, 10 and 11.

325
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:47,208
Then the device explodes
at midnight.

326
00:24:47,876 --> 00:24:51,087
If we can figure out the first church
and get there before he does

327
00:24:51,255 --> 00:24:54,382
maybe we can stop it.
But I can't find the start of the path

328
00:24:54,550 --> 00:24:56,467
until I get into the archives.

329
00:24:57,427 --> 00:24:59,137
Even if I wanted to help you

330
00:24:59,305 --> 00:25:01,807
access to the archives
is only by written decree

331
00:25:01,975 --> 00:25:04,852
by the curator
and the Board of Vatican Librarians.

332
00:25:05,019 --> 00:25:06,687
Or by papal mandate.

333
00:25:06,855 --> 00:25:10,691
Yes, but as you no doubt have heard,
the Holy Father is dead.

334
00:25:11,526 --> 00:25:12,818
What about il camerlengo?

335
00:25:12,986 --> 00:25:16,321
The camerlengo is just a priest here,
the former pope's chamberlain.

336
00:25:16,489 --> 00:25:20,492
Doesn't the power of the Holy See rest
in him during tempe sede vacante?

337
00:25:28,459 --> 00:25:31,336
Fellas, you called me.

338
00:25:32,755 --> 00:25:34,423
His Holiness once told me a pope

339
00:25:34,591 --> 00:25:38,219
was a man torn between
the real world and the divine.

340
00:25:38,387 --> 00:25:41,556
It seems the real world
is upon us tonight.

341
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:46,227
I'm familiar with Illuminati lore
and the legend of the brandings.

342
00:25:46,645 --> 00:25:49,939
La purga is a dark stain
on this Church's history.

343
00:25:50,107 --> 00:25:53,151
I'm not surprised this ghost
has returned to haunt us.

344
00:25:55,362 --> 00:25:58,740
Comandante, have you begun
the search for this explosive device?

345
00:25:58,908 --> 00:26:00,617
Of course, but it could be anywhere.

346
00:26:00,784 --> 00:26:03,703
My primary concern at the moment
is the safety of the cardinals.

347
00:26:03,871 --> 00:26:05,872
The Sistine Chapel is a fortress.

348
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:08,750
As long as the cardinals
are in conclave, your concerns

349
00:26:08,918 --> 00:26:11,461
are at a minimum.
Devote as many of your resources...

350
00:26:11,629 --> 00:26:13,839
If you're about to suggest
a naked-eye search

351
00:26:14,007 --> 00:26:17,384
of the entire Vatican City, I will tell
you we do not have the people.

352
00:26:17,552 --> 00:26:20,554
Though I am not His Holiness,
when you are addressing me

353
00:26:20,722 --> 00:26:23,140
you are addressing this oftice.
Do you understand?

354
00:26:25,435 --> 00:26:26,477
Yes, Father.

355
00:26:27,062 --> 00:26:28,813
Good.

356
00:26:29,648 --> 00:26:33,734
You said the image on the screen
was illuminated by artificial light.

357
00:26:33,902 --> 00:26:36,028
Might I suggest
methodically cutting power

358
00:26:36,196 --> 00:26:38,322
to various sections of the city.

359
00:26:38,490 --> 00:26:41,075
When the image goes dark,
you'll have a specific idea

360
00:26:41,243 --> 00:26:43,327
of the camera's location.

361
00:26:46,748 --> 00:26:50,209
Dr. Vetra, besides yourself
and your research partner

362
00:26:50,377 --> 00:26:53,797
who else knew
about this antimatter project?

363
00:26:54,215 --> 00:26:58,593
No one but the research team.
This project was strictly confidential.

364
00:26:58,761 --> 00:27:00,679
But Silvano kept detailed journals.

365
00:27:00,847 --> 00:27:02,138
If he told anyone else

366
00:27:02,723 --> 00:27:05,267
about what we were doing,
he would have made a note.

367
00:27:05,434 --> 00:27:06,852
Do you have these journals?

368
00:27:07,019 --> 00:27:09,563
I can have them flown here
from Geneva in an hour.

369
00:27:09,730 --> 00:27:11,398
Please.

370
00:27:12,775 --> 00:27:14,109
Professor Langdon.

371
00:27:25,288 --> 00:27:30,918
Mr. Langdon, you are correct that I
may grant you access to the archives.

372
00:27:33,046 --> 00:27:34,797
Thank you, Padre.

373
00:27:34,965 --> 00:27:38,718
I said that you were correct
that I may, not that I will.

374
00:27:39,887 --> 00:27:42,889
Christianity's most sacred codices
are in that archive.

375
00:27:44,391 --> 00:27:47,810
Given your recent entanglement
with the Church

376
00:27:47,978 --> 00:27:50,313
there is a question I'd like
to ask you first

377
00:27:50,481 --> 00:27:52,940
in the office of His Holiness.

378
00:28:00,741 --> 00:28:02,408
Do you believe in God, sir?

379
00:28:06,206 --> 00:28:09,583
Father, I simply believe
that religion...

380
00:28:09,751 --> 00:28:13,253
I did not ask if you believe
what man says about God.

381
00:28:13,421 --> 00:28:15,255
I asked if you believe in God.

382
00:28:18,218 --> 00:28:19,927
I'm an academic.

383
00:28:21,054 --> 00:28:24,014
My mind tells me I will never

384
00:28:24,265 --> 00:28:25,724
understand God.

385
00:28:26,768 --> 00:28:28,352
And your heart?

386
00:28:31,189 --> 00:28:33,482
Tells me I'm not meant to.

387
00:28:34,943 --> 00:28:36,527
Faith is a gift

388
00:28:36,778 --> 00:28:38,946
that I have yet to receive.

389
00:28:45,454 --> 00:28:48,039
Be delicate with our treasures.

390
00:28:54,463 --> 00:28:55,630
The archives are this way.

391
00:28:55,798 --> 00:28:57,715
Professor Langdon.

392
00:28:58,801 --> 00:29:01,970
If this path really leads
to the Church of Illumination

393
00:29:02,137 --> 00:29:04,472
that may be where they've hidden
the antimatter.

394
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,432
"A shining star
at the end of the path."

395
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:07,642
Follow the path.

396
00:29:07,810 --> 00:29:10,645
- We may find the canister.
- Can you deactivate the device?

397
00:29:10,813 --> 00:29:12,147
I can change the batteries

398
00:29:12,314 --> 00:29:14,566
as long as we have
more than five minutes.

399
00:29:14,733 --> 00:29:17,986
That would give us another 24 hours
to get it safely back to CERN.

400
00:29:21,074 --> 00:29:22,116
Robert Langdon.

401
00:29:22,284 --> 00:29:23,951
Vittoria Vetra.

402
00:29:24,119 --> 00:29:27,621
Are you really a symbologist,
or was he mocking you?

403
00:29:27,789 --> 00:29:29,957
Well, both. You're a physicist?

404
00:29:30,125 --> 00:29:33,335
Bio-entanglement physics.
Interconnectivity of life systems.

405
00:29:33,503 --> 00:29:34,795
Okay.

406
00:29:34,963 --> 00:29:38,007
Your project, it was geared
towards energy research?

407
00:29:38,175 --> 00:29:39,341
Eventually, yes.

408
00:29:39,509 --> 00:29:43,512
One speck of antimatter
could power an entire city for a month.

409
00:29:43,763 --> 00:29:46,098
Or tonight, I guess, destroy one.

410
00:29:47,309 --> 00:29:49,143
What are we looking for
in the archives?

411
00:29:49,311 --> 00:29:51,020
A bound volume written by Galileo.

412
00:29:51,188 --> 00:29:52,813
Galileo was Illuminati?

413
00:29:52,981 --> 00:29:55,691
Yeah. And an obedient Catholic
who didn't think

414
00:29:55,859 --> 00:29:57,736
that Church and science
were enemies

415
00:29:57,904 --> 00:30:00,238
but a different language
telling the same story.

416
00:30:00,406 --> 00:30:03,074
He wanted like minds
to find the Church of Illumination...

417
00:30:03,242 --> 00:30:08,497
but he couldn't exactly advertise its
location so he created a coded path.

418
00:30:09,207 --> 00:30:11,875
Richter has started to turn off
the power of various grids.

419
00:30:12,043 --> 00:30:14,169
It'll be back on in a minute.

420
00:30:14,712 --> 00:30:18,381
Then some unknown Illuminati master
sculpted four statues.

421
00:30:18,925 --> 00:30:21,593
Each one a tribute to one
of the fundamental elements

422
00:30:21,761 --> 00:30:23,512
earth, air, fire, water

423
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:27,140
and placed the statues out in public
in churches throughout Rome.

424
00:30:27,308 --> 00:30:29,893
Each statue held a clue
pointing to the next.

425
00:30:30,061 --> 00:30:32,562
At the end of the path
was the Church of Illumination.

426
00:30:32,730 --> 00:30:35,691
If you could find that,
you were one of them.

427
00:30:35,859 --> 00:30:38,611
What makes you think he's going
to murder in the churches?

428
00:30:39,112 --> 00:30:41,113
The Illuminati called
those four churches

429
00:30:41,281 --> 00:30:45,117
by the special name,
L'Altare della scienza.

430
00:30:45,285 --> 00:30:48,246
"Sacrifice them on the altars
of science,", he said.

431
00:30:48,413 --> 00:30:50,081
Exactly.

432
00:30:53,252 --> 00:30:56,170
Oh, wow. Look at this.

433
00:31:21,531 --> 00:31:23,782
Excuse me, signore.

434
00:31:25,201 --> 00:31:27,995
Cardinal Strauss,
you've been informed of the situation?

435
00:31:28,163 --> 00:31:29,621
Yeah.

436
00:31:30,081 --> 00:31:33,667
My belief is we should proceed
with the sealing of conclave.

437
00:31:33,835 --> 00:31:37,629
At this late hour?
That would be highly unorthodox.

438
00:31:37,797 --> 00:31:41,258
And yet within Church law.
It's in my power. I am Great Elector.

439
00:31:41,426 --> 00:31:43,594
The cruelest honor in Christendom.

440
00:31:43,761 --> 00:31:47,139
I have no personal ambitions,
Patrick.

441
00:31:47,307 --> 00:31:51,144
Only those I hold for my Church,
St. Peter's Church...

442
00:31:51,312 --> 00:31:54,147
which is under attack
at its most vulnerable moment.

443
00:31:54,315 --> 00:31:55,732
And this is not a coincidence.

444
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:59,319
The Church will not fall in a day.
We must evacuate Vatican City.

445
00:31:59,487 --> 00:32:02,405
Oh, that is exactly what they want.

446
00:32:02,573 --> 00:32:04,240
Publicity and panic.

447
00:32:04,408 --> 00:32:07,410
No, we must not give them oxygen
for the media fire.

448
00:32:08,454 --> 00:32:10,663
But the people
in St. Peter's Square...

449
00:32:10,831 --> 00:32:15,001
Care deeply about their Church,
as we do.

450
00:32:15,169 --> 00:32:17,587
Their faith will sustain them.

451
00:32:17,755 --> 00:32:20,256
Their faith will not protect them
from an explosion.

452
00:32:20,424 --> 00:32:21,966
Well.

453
00:32:22,134 --> 00:32:26,638
We are all bound for heaven
eventually, are we not?

454
00:32:26,805 --> 00:32:30,184
Spoken like one who has enjoyed
the blessings of a long and full life.

455
00:32:30,352 --> 00:32:31,852
Patrick

456
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:35,272
do not confuse the power
of the office you temporarily hold

457
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:38,359
with your true place
here in the Vatican.

458
00:32:40,195 --> 00:32:42,696
You were a favorite
of His Holiness

459
00:32:43,198 --> 00:32:46,700
but His Holiness
is with his father now.

460
00:32:49,204 --> 00:32:50,496
Mea culpa.

461
00:32:51,206 --> 00:32:52,915
Seal the doors.

462
00:33:07,473 --> 00:33:09,891
Extra omnes.

463
00:34:27,847 --> 00:34:30,098
Hello. This way, please.

464
00:34:31,309 --> 00:34:32,809
Oh, beautiful.

465
00:34:37,732 --> 00:34:39,441
The chambers are hermetic vaults.

466
00:34:39,609 --> 00:34:41,777
Oxygen is kept
at lowest possible levels.

467
00:34:41,945 --> 00:34:43,821
It's a partial vacuum inside.

468
00:34:43,988 --> 00:34:46,490
So extended stays
are not recommended.

469
00:34:47,116 --> 00:34:50,285
So don't panic if you feel
lightheaded at first.

470
00:35:02,299 --> 00:35:04,050
I'll be just outside the door.

471
00:35:04,552 --> 00:35:06,886
Watching you, Mr. Langdon.

472
00:35:23,654 --> 00:35:26,156
By the way,
it's normal to feel a little light-headed.

473
00:35:26,323 --> 00:35:31,244
Yeah. Feels like I'm scuba diving
with the wrong mixture.

474
00:35:31,412 --> 00:35:33,246
Take a second. We have time.

475
00:35:35,041 --> 00:35:36,959
Actually, I take that back.

476
00:35:37,127 --> 00:35:40,921
- Is that Mickey Mouse?
- Yeah. It's a long story.

477
00:36:32,767 --> 00:36:35,435
Conclave will go on without us.

478
00:36:35,603 --> 00:36:39,523
It must, now of all times.

479
00:36:39,690 --> 00:36:42,400
May God forgive you
for what you've done.

480
00:36:50,410 --> 00:36:52,203
Father, if God has issues

481
00:36:53,330 --> 00:36:56,457
they won't be with what I've done.

482
00:36:56,625 --> 00:36:59,418
They will be
with what I'm about to do.

483
00:37:20,983 --> 00:37:23,234
It was confiscated
from the Netherlands

484
00:37:23,402 --> 00:37:26,488
by the Vatican
just after Galileo died.

485
00:37:26,656 --> 00:37:29,116
I've been petitioning to see it
for about 10 years

486
00:37:29,284 --> 00:37:31,910
ever since I realized
what was in it.

487
00:37:32,078 --> 00:37:33,996
What makes you so sure
the segno's there?

488
00:37:34,164 --> 00:37:35,539
The number 503.

489
00:37:35,707 --> 00:37:39,710
I kept seeing it over and over again
in Illuminati letters

490
00:37:39,878 --> 00:37:43,672
scribbled in the margins,
sometimes just signed "503."

491
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:45,507
It's a numeric clue. But to what?

492
00:37:45,675 --> 00:37:48,594
Five? Well, that's a meaningful
number to the Illuminati.

493
00:37:48,761 --> 00:37:52,055
There's the pentagram, Pythagoras,
dozens of other examples in science.

494
00:37:52,223 --> 00:37:53,265
But what about three?

495
00:37:53,433 --> 00:37:56,602
Didn't make sense until I thought,
"What if it's Roman numerals?"

496
00:37:56,769 --> 00:38:00,647
- D-III.
- D-three. Galileo's third text.

497
00:38:00,815 --> 00:38:05,737
"Dialogo. Discorso. Diagramma."

498
00:38:11,118 --> 00:38:12,660
Yeah.

499
00:38:16,874 --> 00:38:18,208
Just a few days with this

500
00:38:18,375 --> 00:38:20,543
and I could have
actually finished my book

501
00:38:20,711 --> 00:38:24,130
and sold dozens of copies
at the Harvard bookstore.

502
00:38:24,298 --> 00:38:26,883
"Il Diagramma Veritatis."

503
00:38:27,051 --> 00:38:28,885
Diagram of Truth.

504
00:38:29,595 --> 00:38:31,638
I know about Dialogo and Discorsi.

505
00:38:32,223 --> 00:38:35,558
Galileo laid out his theories about
the Earth revolving around the sun.

506
00:38:35,726 --> 00:38:38,645
Yeah, and said the Earth
was not the center of some universe

507
00:38:38,812 --> 00:38:41,440
with heaven above, hell below,
as the Church had said.

508
00:38:41,608 --> 00:38:44,985
So they forced him to recant in the
second book. But what was this one?

509
00:38:45,153 --> 00:38:46,779
This is how he got the word out.

510
00:38:46,947 --> 00:38:49,740
This is the truth, not what the Vatican
forced him to write.

511
00:38:49,908 --> 00:38:53,494
Smuggled out of Rome, printed
in Holland on sedge papyrus, see?

512
00:38:53,662 --> 00:38:57,039
That way any scientist caught with
a copy could just throw it in water

513
00:38:57,207 --> 00:38:59,834
and Galileo's heresy
would dissolve, disappear.

514
00:39:00,252 --> 00:39:03,420
And between that
and Vatican burnings

515
00:39:03,588 --> 00:39:06,757
it's possible that
this is the only copy that remains.

516
00:39:07,259 --> 00:39:08,926
And if I'm correct,

517
00:39:09,094 --> 00:39:13,764
the segno is hidden
on page number...

518
00:39:13,932 --> 00:39:15,516
Five.

519
00:39:15,684 --> 00:39:17,226
Yeah.

520
00:39:23,776 --> 00:39:25,360
Do you need help with the Latin?

521
00:39:26,571 --> 00:39:27,612
Sure.

522
00:39:34,954 --> 00:39:39,958
Movement of the planets,
elliptical orbits, heliocentricity.

523
00:39:42,461 --> 00:39:45,964
Sorry, I don't think there's anything
that could be interpreted as a...

524
00:39:46,132 --> 00:39:47,465
Wait, wait, wait.

525
00:39:47,633 --> 00:39:49,634
Do that again.

526
00:39:51,262 --> 00:39:52,304
What is that?

527
00:39:55,349 --> 00:39:58,436
Wait a minute, it's a watermark.
And there's a line of text.

528
00:39:58,604 --> 00:40:00,771
Go back.

529
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:03,107
It's in English.

530
00:40:03,275 --> 00:40:06,652
English? Why English?

531
00:40:06,820 --> 00:40:09,697
English wasn't used in the Vatican.
It was too polluted.

532
00:40:09,865 --> 00:40:12,408
It was free-thinking.
It was a language of radicals

533
00:40:12,576 --> 00:40:15,286
like Shakespeare and Chaucer.

534
00:40:15,454 --> 00:40:19,749
Here's another one. "The path of light
is laid, the sacred test..."

535
00:40:19,917 --> 00:40:24,337
- Will you write this down as I dictate?
- Sorry, professor, no time.

536
00:40:29,051 --> 00:40:32,053
Yeah, yeah, what the hell. Yeah.

537
00:40:47,487 --> 00:40:48,695
Twenty minutes till 8.

538
00:40:48,863 --> 00:40:50,697
- Where are we headed?
- Hold on, hold on.

539
00:40:50,865 --> 00:40:53,867
I'll tell you in a minute.
Let me see that page again.

540
00:41:00,041 --> 00:41:01,834
Where did you get that paper?

541
00:41:02,001 --> 00:41:03,293
We borrowed it.

542
00:41:03,461 --> 00:41:06,713
"From Santi's earthly tomb
with demon's hole."

543
00:41:06,881 --> 00:41:08,006
Are you insane?

544
00:41:08,174 --> 00:41:11,177
"Cross Rome the mystic elements
unfold.

545
00:41:12,221 --> 00:41:14,722
The path of light is laid,
the sacred test.

546
00:41:15,391 --> 00:41:19,060
Let angels guide thee
on thy lofty quest."

547
00:41:19,728 --> 00:41:22,814
You removed a document
from the Vatican Archives?

548
00:41:22,982 --> 00:41:24,399
She did.

549
00:41:29,196 --> 00:41:31,239
"From Santi's earthly tomb."

550
00:41:31,407 --> 00:41:34,576
- The first marker is at Santi's tomb.
- Yeah.

551
00:41:34,743 --> 00:41:36,995
- But who's Santi?
- Raphael.

552
00:41:37,162 --> 00:41:39,914
- II Raftaello, the sculptor?
- Yeah, Santi was his last name.

553
00:41:40,082 --> 00:41:41,916
So the path starts
at Raphael's tomb.

554
00:41:42,084 --> 00:41:44,169
Raphael's buried at the Pantheon.

555
00:41:44,336 --> 00:41:47,505
- Isn't the Pantheon a church?
- Oldest Catholic church in Rome.

556
00:42:07,652 --> 00:42:10,487
I just pulled a dozen of our best men
for this.

557
00:42:11,907 --> 00:42:14,450
- You better be right.
- This is one of the busiest spots.

558
00:42:14,618 --> 00:42:17,411
- He'd never get away with it.
- The poem implies...

559
00:42:17,579 --> 00:42:19,622
"The poem"? Unbelievable.

560
00:42:19,789 --> 00:42:21,081
I'm basing this operation

561
00:42:21,249 --> 00:42:24,793
on an American's interpretation
of a 400-year-old poem.

562
00:42:24,961 --> 00:42:27,797
The information we have
clearly refers to Raphael's tomb.

563
00:42:27,965 --> 00:42:29,716
Raphael's tomb
is inside that building.

564
00:42:29,884 --> 00:42:33,970
Because the Vatican destroyed all of
the pagan statues in the late-1800s

565
00:42:34,138 --> 00:42:37,682
if this is the marker, whatever clues
were here to lead us are gone now.

566
00:42:37,850 --> 00:42:41,144
The path is dead. So this is it,
your only chance.

567
00:42:43,272 --> 00:42:44,648
Separate approaches.

568
00:42:44,815 --> 00:42:48,401
No closer than two blocks
and no uniforms. Three minutes.

569
00:42:48,569 --> 00:42:50,654
And I need a set of eyes inside.

570
00:42:54,992 --> 00:42:56,117
Excuse me?

571
00:42:56,285 --> 00:42:59,704
Weightlifters in matching suits and
earpieces? They're hardly disguised.

572
00:42:59,872 --> 00:43:01,831
- Well, it's what I have.
- Fine, I'll go in.

573
00:43:01,999 --> 00:43:05,127
You don't have communication.
You can't carry a walkie-talkie.

574
00:43:05,295 --> 00:43:07,255
- Tourists have cell phones.
- No, no.

575
00:43:07,422 --> 00:43:09,632
You can't send her in there alone.

576
00:43:10,843 --> 00:43:12,677
All right, I won't.

577
00:43:24,022 --> 00:43:27,066
Don't look so anxious.
We're supposed to be married.

578
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:30,695
Well, maybe we're not
getting along today.

579
00:43:32,865 --> 00:43:34,615
Hold my hand.

580
00:43:35,701 --> 00:43:40,539
- But don't crush it.
- Sorry. A nervous newlywed.

581
00:43:43,501 --> 00:43:46,044
Oh, look. Look, honey, the oculus.

582
00:43:46,838 --> 00:43:48,881
That could be the "demon's hole"
in the poem.

583
00:43:49,048 --> 00:43:50,841
Why are the tombs at an angle?

584
00:43:51,009 --> 00:43:53,218
They're facing east
to worship the rising sun.

585
00:43:53,386 --> 00:43:54,928
But this is a Christian church.

586
00:43:55,096 --> 00:43:58,223
New religions often adopt
the existing customs and holidays

587
00:43:58,391 --> 00:44:00,225
to make conversion
less of a shock.

588
00:44:01,060 --> 00:44:02,895
Like the 25th of December?

589
00:44:03,062 --> 00:44:05,522
It's the pagan celebration
of the Unconquered Sun

590
00:44:05,690 --> 00:44:08,400
and also makes a handy date
for the birth of Christ.

591
00:44:08,568 --> 00:44:10,235
- Let's check the recesses.
- Okay.

592
00:44:10,403 --> 00:44:13,614
I'll go to the right.
I'll meet you at 180 degrees.

593
00:44:15,742 --> 00:44:17,535
Follow me, please.

594
00:44:17,703 --> 00:44:21,331
Now, the Pantheon, which means
"Temple of All Gods"

595
00:44:21,498 --> 00:44:25,793
was originally built as a temple
to all the gods of ancient Rome

596
00:44:25,961 --> 00:44:28,129
in 27 B.C.

597
00:44:28,297 --> 00:44:31,716
Although the design of the building
is usually credited...

598
00:44:31,884 --> 00:44:34,093
to Apollodorus of Damascus.

599
00:44:35,429 --> 00:44:36,930
Robert!

600
00:44:38,599 --> 00:44:40,517
Robert.

601
00:44:43,604 --> 00:44:44,812
It's Raphael's tomb.

602
00:44:44,980 --> 00:44:47,440
- But it's the wrong one.
- What are you talking about?

603
00:44:47,608 --> 00:44:51,945
He was moved here in 1759, a century
after Diagramma was published.

604
00:44:52,112 --> 00:44:54,697
Where was he originally buried?

605
00:44:54,865 --> 00:44:56,951
Urbino, I think.
"Santi's earthly tomb."

606
00:44:57,118 --> 00:44:59,745
What could it possibly be?
"Santi's earthly tomb."

607
00:45:01,831 --> 00:45:04,291
Damn it. Santi's tomb.

608
00:45:04,793 --> 00:45:06,794
It must mean a chapel that he built.

609
00:45:07,379 --> 00:45:09,129
He's not buried in it, he designed it.

610
00:45:09,297 --> 00:45:11,549
The "demon's hole,"
it's not that oculus.

611
00:45:11,716 --> 00:45:13,300
It's an undercroft. It's a crypt.

612
00:45:13,468 --> 00:45:15,135
- Are there any questions?
- Yes.

613
00:45:16,179 --> 00:45:17,471
Yes.

614
00:45:17,639 --> 00:45:20,975
Did Raphael Santi ever design
a chapel with an ossuary annex

615
00:45:21,142 --> 00:45:23,978
and an angel figure commissioned
by the Catholic Church?

616
00:45:25,647 --> 00:45:27,815
I'm sorry, I can only think of one.

617
00:45:29,484 --> 00:45:31,318
One is good.

618
00:45:31,486 --> 00:45:33,822
- Wrong? What do you mean?
- It's the Chigi Chapel

619
00:45:33,990 --> 00:45:36,157
in the church
of the Santa Maria del Popolo.

620
00:45:36,325 --> 00:45:39,494
It was once called the Capella della
Terra, the Chapel of the Earth.

621
00:45:39,662 --> 00:45:41,997
Earth, the first element. That's it.

622
00:45:42,164 --> 00:45:45,458
- You were certain about the Pantheon.
- We have four minutes.

623
00:45:48,170 --> 00:45:49,921
Back to the Vatican? You can't.

624
00:45:50,089 --> 00:45:52,507
If you care at all
about your church, you'll listen.

625
00:45:52,675 --> 00:45:54,342
My church?

626
00:45:56,012 --> 00:45:58,346
My church comforts
the sick and dying.

627
00:45:58,514 --> 00:45:59,890
My church feeds the hungry.

628
00:46:00,057 --> 00:46:03,185
What does your church do,
Mr. Langdon?

629
00:46:03,853 --> 00:46:06,438
That's right, you don't have one.

630
00:46:07,815 --> 00:46:10,359
Take him if you want.
I'm done with him.

631
00:46:22,789 --> 00:46:25,917
All right, this makes sense.
Look, right in front of the church.

632
00:46:26,084 --> 00:46:27,752
An obelisk, a lofty pyramid.

633
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:30,546
Egyptian symbol
adopted by the Illuminati.

634
00:46:30,714 --> 00:46:33,841
If he's going to kill him,
he'll do it here.

635
00:46:49,901 --> 00:46:51,485
Eight o'clock.

636
00:47:00,745 --> 00:47:02,371
Robert.

637
00:47:21,099 --> 00:47:23,475
No, no, here. It's an annulus.

638
00:47:51,755 --> 00:47:53,715
Which one is the Chigi Chapel?

639
00:47:54,049 --> 00:47:55,592
It's in one of these apses.

640
00:49:47,624 --> 00:49:49,834
Pyramids in a Catholic church.

641
00:49:50,002 --> 00:49:53,546
This is it. This is the Chigi Chapel.

642
00:50:11,774 --> 00:50:13,025
The demon's hole.

643
00:50:17,197 --> 00:50:18,697
But it's askew.

644
00:50:18,865 --> 00:50:20,324
Come here.

645
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:29,458
Hand me your flashlight.

646
00:50:29,626 --> 00:50:31,251
What's that?

647
00:51:30,188 --> 00:51:33,023
I call as my witness Christ the Lord

648
00:51:33,191 --> 00:51:36,068
who will be my judge,
that my vote is given

649
00:51:36,236 --> 00:51:39,154
to the one before God
I think should be elected.

650
00:52:03,264 --> 00:52:08,101
I elect as the most high pontiff,
Dominic Scolamiero.

651
00:52:21,782 --> 00:52:24,327
Edoardo Rossi.

652
00:52:24,786 --> 00:52:27,705
They are voting for themselves
to prevent a majority.

653
00:52:28,332 --> 00:52:31,667
They are waiting for the preferiti
to be rescued.

654
00:52:31,835 --> 00:52:36,005
Perhaps we should as well, yes?

655
00:52:54,316 --> 00:52:56,108
Not until the smoke is white

656
00:52:56,276 --> 00:52:59,695
will the College of Cardinals
have chosen a new Holy Father.

657
00:52:59,863 --> 00:53:03,992
For now, the Vatican seat
of ultimate power remains vacant.

658
00:53:09,958 --> 00:53:13,085
Get the body out of there,
and search the rest of the building.

659
00:53:13,253 --> 00:53:15,087
- Chartrand!
- Sir?

660
00:53:15,255 --> 00:53:17,673
Outside, a perimeter.
Secure but invisible.

661
00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:19,383
No lights, no guns, nobody knows.

662
00:53:19,551 --> 00:53:20,592
- Understand?
- Yes, sir.

663
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:22,719
I'm calling all off-duty.

664
00:53:22,887 --> 00:53:24,721
No information.

665
00:53:25,431 --> 00:53:27,724
Is it Raphael?

666
00:53:27,892 --> 00:53:29,685
The chapel is Raphael.

667
00:53:30,562 --> 00:53:32,813
But the sculptures are Bernini.

668
00:53:35,859 --> 00:53:38,820
The unknown Illuminati master

669
00:53:39,947 --> 00:53:40,989
Bernini?

670
00:53:42,408 --> 00:53:44,033
He worked for the Church.

671
00:53:44,201 --> 00:53:46,619
Almost exclusively.

672
00:53:46,787 --> 00:53:49,873
But the Illuminati were infiltrators.

673
00:53:50,833 --> 00:53:53,626
There wasn't a powerful organization
they didn't penetrate

674
00:53:53,794 --> 00:53:57,171
including the Vatican
by hiding in plain sight.

675
00:54:01,385 --> 00:54:03,428
Habakkuk and the Angel.

676
00:54:04,179 --> 00:54:07,223
He's the prophet that predicted
the annihilation of the Earth.

677
00:54:07,391 --> 00:54:11,811
"Let angels guide thee
on thy lofty quest."

678
00:54:15,399 --> 00:54:17,151
This is the first marker.

679
00:54:17,485 --> 00:54:19,195
The path is alive.

680
00:54:32,042 --> 00:54:33,500
South-west.

681
00:54:33,668 --> 00:54:35,794
It was pointing south-west.

682
00:54:35,962 --> 00:54:39,381
Earth, air, fire, water.
We're looking for a Bernini sculpture...

683
00:54:39,549 --> 00:54:40,716
having to do with air.

684
00:54:40,884 --> 00:54:43,802
The second church is somewhere
southwest of here.

685
00:54:43,970 --> 00:54:45,346
You're sure this time?

686
00:54:45,513 --> 00:54:48,974
I need a map showing
all the churches of Rome.

687
00:54:51,978 --> 00:54:54,022
I could use it now.

688
00:55:29,350 --> 00:55:32,895
All right, the purple areas with these
black crosses represent the churches.

689
00:55:33,397 --> 00:55:35,731
But nothing intersects the line
until it hits...

690
00:55:35,899 --> 00:55:38,901
- Until it hits St. Peter's.
- Michelangelo designed St. Peter's

691
00:55:39,069 --> 00:55:41,445
- not Bernini.
- Michelangelo designed the Basilica.

692
00:55:41,613 --> 00:55:43,489
Bernini designed St. Peter's Square.

693
00:55:43,657 --> 00:55:46,701
The second marker must be
a statue in St. Peter's Square.

694
00:55:52,583 --> 00:55:54,834
It's 10 minutes till 9.
Can you go any faster?

695
00:55:55,002 --> 00:55:57,837
Not unless you want the full attention
of the world press.

696
00:56:06,722 --> 00:56:10,392
There was no consensus
after the first ballot

697
00:56:10,560 --> 00:56:14,730
but Cardinal Baggia, the Italian,
is the odds-on favorite.

698
00:56:14,898 --> 00:56:18,442
There is no new Pope,
but it is possible

699
00:56:18,610 --> 00:56:22,863
that Cardinal Guidera, the Spaniard,
is the most probable.

700
00:56:23,031 --> 00:56:29,536
It is possible that Cardinal Ebner,
from Germany, is the favorite.

701
00:56:30,580 --> 00:56:33,832
Stem cell research is murder!

702
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,877
You're condemning sick people to die.

703
00:56:37,045 --> 00:56:38,795
Man is not God.

704
00:56:51,477 --> 00:56:53,102
There, another obelisk.

705
00:56:53,270 --> 00:56:56,481
Check the crowd. It's almost 9.
He's gotta be here already.

706
00:57:31,476 --> 00:57:34,186
There must be 100 statues
up there.

707
00:57:34,354 --> 00:57:37,314
None of them are angels.
Those are all saints.

708
00:57:37,899 --> 00:57:42,194
How in God's name would anyone
create a sculpture about air?

709
00:57:49,786 --> 00:57:53,038
Bas-relief. Of course.
It's still a sculpture.

710
00:57:53,206 --> 00:57:55,875
Check the ground.
Look at the carvings.

711
00:57:56,042 --> 00:57:58,711
Look for another having something
to do with air.

712
00:58:19,483 --> 00:58:21,776
"West Ponente,"
west wind.

713
00:58:23,070 --> 00:58:24,279
Vittoria!

714
00:58:24,447 --> 00:58:25,697
Here it is.

715
00:58:26,574 --> 00:58:29,868
West wind. An angel
blowing out five streaks of air.

716
00:58:30,036 --> 00:58:31,620
This is it.

717
00:59:35,395 --> 00:59:37,396
Get the police!

718
00:59:38,606 --> 00:59:40,232
Call an ambulance!

719
00:59:49,909 --> 00:59:50,993
He's still alive.

720
01:00:06,135 --> 01:00:09,095
His chest.
They punctured his lungs.

721
01:00:23,611 --> 01:00:25,778
Clear the square.

722
01:01:29,178 --> 01:01:31,888
"...from within your walls to squeeze
life from the Bishop."

723
01:01:32,056 --> 01:01:35,559
He's actually claiming responsibility
for the death of His Holiness.

724
01:01:35,726 --> 01:01:38,103
That's ridiculous.
He died of a stroke.

725
01:01:38,271 --> 01:01:41,356
It implies the Illuminati murdered him
with his own medication.

726
01:01:41,524 --> 01:01:43,358
What?

727
01:01:43,943 --> 01:01:45,444
Down here.

728
01:01:45,612 --> 01:01:48,573
"With man's solution
we stilled his heart.

729
01:01:48,740 --> 01:01:52,451
With his own needle
did we pierce his unholy veil."

730
01:01:52,870 --> 01:01:56,372
Did the Holy Father take any kind
of medication by injection?

731
01:01:56,540 --> 01:01:57,707
Tinzaparin.

732
01:01:58,625 --> 01:02:00,042
He had thrombophlebitis.

733
01:02:00,210 --> 01:02:03,546
He took an injection every day.
But no one knew that.

734
01:02:03,714 --> 01:02:04,797
Someone knew.

735
01:02:04,965 --> 01:02:08,301
Well, he had health concerns
and seizures as well.

736
01:02:08,468 --> 01:02:11,888
But he took steps to make sure
he was watched, for safety.

737
01:02:12,055 --> 01:02:15,141
He didn't want it made public,
so we have no reason to discuss it.

738
01:02:15,309 --> 01:02:17,852
Tinzaparin is lethal
in the wrong dosage.

739
01:02:18,020 --> 01:02:20,438
An overdose could cause
massive internal bleeding

740
01:02:20,606 --> 01:02:21,773
and brain hemorrhages.

741
01:02:21,941 --> 01:02:25,736
It might look like a stroke at first, but in
a few days his body would show signs.

742
01:02:25,904 --> 01:02:27,321
This could easily be examined.

743
01:02:27,488 --> 01:02:29,156
In case you're not aware of it...

744
01:02:29,324 --> 01:02:32,701
papal autopsy is prohibited
by Vatican law.

745
01:02:32,869 --> 01:02:35,120
We're not going to defile
His Holiness's body

746
01:02:35,288 --> 01:02:36,914
just because his enemies claim...

747
01:02:37,081 --> 01:02:40,125
- Why would they send this letter now?
- Well, to cause panic.

748
01:02:40,293 --> 01:02:42,628
"The sun will blind at midnight

749
01:02:42,795 --> 01:02:45,422
and neither police nor professors
can stop it."

750
01:02:46,174 --> 01:02:47,549
He knows I'm here.

751
01:02:47,717 --> 01:02:50,552
Obviously they were hoping
this letter would become public.

752
01:02:50,720 --> 01:02:52,721
We might be wise to preempt
their attempt

753
01:02:52,889 --> 01:02:56,016
by making an announcement
of our own to refute this absurd claim.

754
01:02:56,184 --> 01:02:57,726
That's out of the question.

755
01:02:57,894 --> 01:03:01,022
Cardinal Strauss has insisted
this entire matter be kept internal.

756
01:03:01,190 --> 01:03:03,358
He shouldn't be aware of it.
He's in conclave.

757
01:03:03,525 --> 01:03:07,445
His final instructions before sealing
the doors were very clear.

758
01:03:07,613 --> 01:03:10,657
Cardinal Strauss does not dictate
Vatican protocols.

759
01:03:11,367 --> 01:03:13,284
As you say, yet, technically

760
01:03:13,452 --> 01:03:14,994
now that conclave has begun...

761
01:03:15,162 --> 01:03:18,206
It's his privilege and duty
to control public announcements.

762
01:03:18,374 --> 01:03:21,042
I've drafted a release
about the incident in the piazza

763
01:03:21,210 --> 01:03:24,712
but any other statements
are specifically prohibited.

764
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:29,717
For that, Cardinal has asked me
to remind you we have a chimney.

765
01:03:33,722 --> 01:03:36,224
Commander Richter,
the search for the device?

766
01:03:36,392 --> 01:03:40,271
Well, we've turned the power on and
oft to about 20 percent of Vatican City.

767
01:03:40,438 --> 01:03:43,065
- Nothing on the video yet.
- We're running out of options.

768
01:03:43,233 --> 01:03:45,067
How long would you need
to evacuate?

769
01:03:45,235 --> 01:03:48,404
If I pull all my men from the search
for the bomb, 30 minutes.

770
01:03:50,156 --> 01:03:54,535
Mr. Langdon. You have been right
so far about the path. It's now 9:15.

771
01:03:54,703 --> 01:03:56,662
How quickly can you find
the next church?

772
01:03:56,830 --> 01:03:59,748
The lines on the carving pointed east,
away from Vatican City.

773
01:03:59,916 --> 01:04:02,751
But there were five of them,
so there's room for error.

774
01:04:02,919 --> 01:04:05,254
About 20 churches intersect
those lines.

775
01:04:05,422 --> 01:04:07,423
None of them have names
that invoke fire.

776
01:04:07,591 --> 01:04:10,384
So a Bernini sculpture must be inside
one of them that does.

777
01:04:10,552 --> 01:04:12,678
We'll need to get
into the archives to find it.

778
01:04:12,846 --> 01:04:15,682
- Would you escort Mr. Langdon?
- Yes, Father.

779
01:04:17,894 --> 01:04:19,269
Silvano's journals.

780
01:04:19,437 --> 01:04:22,105
The killer's name could be in here.
May I stay?

781
01:04:22,607 --> 01:04:24,274
Please. Fine, of course.

782
01:04:25,902 --> 01:04:27,777
Professor.

783
01:04:28,613 --> 01:04:31,948
Would it surprise you to find
those clothes suit you?

784
01:04:32,617 --> 01:04:34,951
It would surprise the hell out of me.

785
01:04:49,880 --> 01:04:55,010
The Vatican is expressing sympathy
for the mugging victim

786
01:04:55,177 --> 01:04:59,472
a Dusseldorf tourist,
now confirmed dead.

787
01:04:59,640 --> 01:05:04,102
The Vatican police have a suspect
in custody.

788
01:05:04,270 --> 01:05:11,276
The Vatican will allow the crowd back
into St. Peter's Square

789
01:05:11,444 --> 01:05:13,153
where security will be doubled.

790
01:05:13,320 --> 01:05:17,574
The Vatican did admit that where there
are crowds, so often follows crime.

791
01:05:17,742 --> 01:05:20,493
We're trying now to get the name
of the tourist who was...

792
01:05:20,661 --> 01:05:23,330
- Oh, wait.
- Hand to the right. Keep panning.

793
01:05:23,497 --> 01:05:25,415
We're getting word now of smoke.

794
01:05:25,583 --> 01:05:27,876
Smoke from
the Sistine Chapel chimney.

795
01:05:28,044 --> 01:05:30,295
Apparently there's been
another vote.

796
01:05:30,463 --> 01:05:32,130
The smoke is black.

797
01:05:32,298 --> 01:05:35,008
Once again, the cardinals have failed
to reach consensus

798
01:05:35,176 --> 01:05:37,761
and the Catholic Church
remains without a leader.

799
01:05:46,395 --> 01:05:48,313
What are you looking for now?

800
01:05:49,273 --> 01:05:50,857
Church assets.

801
01:05:51,025 --> 01:05:52,567
I beg your pardon?

802
01:05:52,735 --> 01:05:54,652
Artwork. It's valuable.

803
01:05:54,820 --> 01:05:57,989
Corporations tend to keep track
of their holdings.

804
01:05:58,157 --> 01:06:01,785
The Catholic Church
is not a corporation, it's a beacon.

805
01:06:02,495 --> 01:06:05,580
A source of inspiration for one billion
lost and frightened souls.

806
01:06:05,748 --> 01:06:08,416
Sure, I get that. It's also a bank.

807
01:06:19,178 --> 01:06:22,681
Commander Olivetti said I was not
to leave your side this time.

808
01:06:25,059 --> 01:06:26,267
It wasn't me, it was her.

809
01:07:25,036 --> 01:07:26,953
Power is now cut to Zone 73.

810
01:07:27,121 --> 01:07:29,456
No light reaction on the monitor.

811
01:07:29,623 --> 01:07:33,126
Restore power and move on to 74.

812
01:07:43,637 --> 01:07:44,929
What sort of signs?

813
01:07:46,640 --> 01:07:48,016
I'm sorry?

814
01:07:51,687 --> 01:07:56,232
If the Holy Father was given
an overdose of Tinzaparin

815
01:07:56,442 --> 01:07:58,443
what signs would his body bear?

816
01:08:00,363 --> 01:08:02,238
Bleeding of the oral mucosa.

817
01:08:03,741 --> 01:08:04,866
His tongue.

818
01:08:05,034 --> 01:08:09,162
Postmortem, the blood congeals and
turns the inside of the mouth black.

819
01:08:11,582 --> 01:08:13,500
Even after 14 days?

820
01:08:13,668 --> 01:08:16,586
It wouldn't show up
until at least a week after his death.

821
01:08:21,842 --> 01:08:23,760
He was very important to me.

822
01:08:25,513 --> 01:08:27,597
Yeah, I understand.

823
01:08:32,853 --> 01:08:35,021
Will you come with me, please?

824
01:08:42,071 --> 01:08:44,197
Signore, would you organize
a security team

825
01:08:44,365 --> 01:08:46,783
to escort Miss Vetra and myself
down to the crypt?

826
01:08:46,993 --> 01:08:49,244
- Yes, sir.
- We'll be leaving straightaway.

827
01:09:08,556 --> 01:09:09,806
Do you smoke?

828
01:09:11,809 --> 01:09:13,768
A little bit.

829
01:09:13,936 --> 01:09:16,563
Then you better sit down
before you keel over.

830
01:09:18,899 --> 01:09:21,317
And what's all that right there?

831
01:09:22,903 --> 01:09:25,238
What does this say
in Italian right here

832
01:09:25,406 --> 01:09:27,824
next to the Ecstasy of Saint Teresa?
Right there.

833
01:09:30,828 --> 01:09:33,038
"Moved at suggestion of the artist."

834
01:09:34,165 --> 01:09:37,667
"Moved"? To another church.
At the suggestion of Bernini?

835
01:09:38,336 --> 01:09:39,836
I don't know.

836
01:09:41,547 --> 01:09:44,424
Here. Translate all of this for me

837
01:09:44,592 --> 01:09:46,593
and I'll buy you a pack of smokes.

838
01:09:46,761 --> 01:09:48,595
I'm looking for a reference to fire.

839
01:09:48,763 --> 01:09:50,347
Fires.

840
01:09:51,849 --> 01:09:55,560
- "Seraphim,", meaning "the fiery one."
- Right.

841
01:09:56,687 --> 01:10:00,940
"His great, golden spear,
a point of fire."

842
01:10:02,860 --> 01:10:06,780
Then "woman left completely afire."

843
01:10:06,947 --> 01:10:10,950
Ecstasy of Saint Teresa.
Saint Teresa on fire.

844
01:10:11,118 --> 01:10:14,079
So this sculpture
was moved to this church?

845
01:10:15,665 --> 01:10:19,125
Why did they shut down the system?
They know we're down here.

846
01:10:19,293 --> 01:10:23,213
If there's no power,
there's no oxygen.

847
01:10:23,381 --> 01:10:26,383
- Can we get out?
- The door is electronic.

848
01:10:27,635 --> 01:10:29,469
Oh, God.

849
01:10:29,637 --> 01:10:31,388
Well, that's disappointing.

850
01:10:33,182 --> 01:10:34,391
Where are we going?

851
01:10:34,600 --> 01:10:36,559
To see my father.

852
01:10:36,727 --> 01:10:38,144
I don't understand.

853
01:10:38,312 --> 01:10:42,232
I was orphaned when I was 9 years
of age. A bombing in Ulster.

854
01:10:42,400 --> 01:10:45,694
The UVF protesting the visit
of a Catholic archbishop.

855
01:10:45,861 --> 01:10:50,532
The archbishop felt responsible,
and he adopted me the following day.

856
01:10:50,700 --> 01:10:53,827
I was raised by him
and by the Church.

857
01:10:54,120 --> 01:10:56,538
He was the wisest man I ever met.

858
01:10:56,706 --> 01:11:00,500
Even when I was young and stubborn,
I wanted to be ordained.

859
01:11:00,668 --> 01:11:04,170
But I was brought up in Italy, so I
also wanted to do my military service.

860
01:11:04,338 --> 01:11:05,922
I wanted to fight.

861
01:11:06,632 --> 01:11:09,759
He told me, "Learn to fly."

862
01:11:09,927 --> 01:11:12,178
So I joined
the Aeronautica Militare...

863
01:11:12,346 --> 01:11:16,099
flew helicopters,
bringing the wounded back to hospital.

864
01:11:16,267 --> 01:11:17,434
He was a great man.

865
01:11:17,643 --> 01:11:19,686
Your father died?

866
01:11:20,646 --> 01:11:22,272
Fourteen days ago.

867
01:11:23,566 --> 01:11:25,567
Command, do you read me?

868
01:11:25,735 --> 01:11:28,445
Power is off. Oxygen is very low.

869
01:11:28,654 --> 01:11:30,780
Come in. Can you read me?

870
01:11:30,948 --> 01:11:32,032
Can you get anything?

871
01:11:32,199 --> 01:11:36,453
No. The walls are lead-lined.
There's no signal.

872
01:14:59,115 --> 01:15:00,490
This way.

873
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:13,003
If the Holy Father was murdered,
the implications are profound.

874
01:15:13,629 --> 01:15:15,755
Vatican security is impenetrable.

875
01:15:15,923 --> 01:15:18,842
No one from the outside
could have got anywhere near him.

876
01:15:19,010 --> 01:15:20,635
It was someone on the inside.

877
01:15:20,803 --> 01:15:23,596
And we can trust no one.

878
01:15:25,391 --> 01:15:28,435
No light reaction on Zone 97.

879
01:15:28,936 --> 01:15:32,856
Based on the rate the battery
is using power

880
01:15:33,024 --> 01:15:36,109
the device will detonate
just before midnight.

881
01:15:58,049 --> 01:16:00,050
Holy Father...

882
01:16:00,801 --> 01:16:04,429
when I was young, you told me
the voice in my heart was God's voice.

883
01:16:05,222 --> 01:16:08,141
You said I should follow it,
no matter how painful.

884
01:16:08,309 --> 01:16:10,060
Forgive me.

885
01:16:10,311 --> 01:16:11,686
Please.

886
01:16:11,896 --> 01:16:13,605
Give me strength.

887
01:16:14,940 --> 01:16:19,903
What I do, I do in the name
of everything you believe.

888
01:16:30,623 --> 01:16:32,082
Remove the cover.

889
01:16:35,419 --> 01:16:37,212
Did you not hear me?

890
01:16:37,546 --> 01:16:40,548
Signore by law,
we are at you command, but...

891
01:16:40,758 --> 01:16:44,094
One day I will ask your forgiveness for
putting you in this position.

892
01:16:44,303 --> 01:16:46,096
But today I ask your obedience.

893
01:16:48,057 --> 01:16:50,725
Vatican laws are there
to protect this church.

894
01:16:50,893 --> 01:16:55,063
And it's in that spirit that I command
you to break one of them now.

895
01:17:50,578 --> 01:17:52,245
God help us.

896
01:18:05,217 --> 01:18:08,178
Santa Maria della Vittoria.
Do you know it?

897
01:18:08,346 --> 01:18:11,598
- Yes, I do.
- It's the next church.

898
01:18:27,782 --> 01:18:29,741
I think someone just tried to kill me.

899
01:18:29,909 --> 01:18:32,243
- I promise you we had no idea...
- He knows I'm here.

900
01:18:32,411 --> 01:18:33,995
- Yes.
- You heard me ask permission.

901
01:18:34,205 --> 01:18:36,122
- You gave me an escort.
- We had no idea

902
01:18:36,290 --> 01:18:40,460
that portions of our white zones
were cross-wired with that building.

903
01:18:40,628 --> 01:18:42,587
Commander Richter
was extending the search.

904
01:18:42,755 --> 01:18:46,216
If he had known,
he never would have killed the power.

905
01:18:47,259 --> 01:18:49,511
Or there is the other possibility.

906
01:18:49,720 --> 01:18:52,222
Is it conceivable the Illuminati

907
01:18:53,349 --> 01:18:55,225
have infiltrated the Swiss Guard?

908
01:18:58,521 --> 01:19:00,021
Perhaps.

909
01:19:05,528 --> 01:19:10,073
- I wanna speak to the camerlengo.
- The camerlengo is unavailable.

910
01:19:10,282 --> 01:19:13,952
He's found evidence that the
Holy Father was indeed murdered.

911
01:19:15,371 --> 01:19:17,706
- He is seeking guidance.
- From whom?

912
01:19:18,666 --> 01:19:20,417
From God.

913
01:19:20,751 --> 01:19:22,460
- Make an effort. Please.
- Yeah, yeah.

914
01:19:55,578 --> 01:19:56,911
The journals. Where are they?

915
01:19:59,915 --> 01:20:02,167
Who took the journals
from this desk?

916
01:20:10,301 --> 01:20:12,385
Someone is here? What is this?

917
01:20:12,553 --> 01:20:15,263
Signore, this is unacceptable.

918
01:20:15,848 --> 01:20:19,184
For a camerlengo to enter the chapel
once conclave has begun.

919
01:20:19,352 --> 01:20:22,604
Forgive me.
There's been a development.

920
01:20:33,115 --> 01:20:35,784
His Holiness Celestine V
was murdered.

921
01:20:35,951 --> 01:20:39,621
Is it so hard to believe
it could happen again?

922
01:20:39,914 --> 01:20:42,082
Signori, please, a moment.

923
01:20:42,249 --> 01:20:44,834
Please, signori.

924
01:20:46,212 --> 01:20:48,797
Our Church is at war.

925
01:20:49,882 --> 01:20:53,343
We are under attack
from an old enemy.

926
01:20:53,511 --> 01:20:54,886
The Illuminati.

927
01:20:55,930 --> 01:20:57,639
They have struck us from within.

928
01:20:58,140 --> 01:21:00,266
Murdering our Holy Father.

929
01:21:00,726 --> 01:21:05,397
And threatening us all with destruction
at the hands of their new god, science.

930
01:21:05,564 --> 01:21:08,775
They call it retribution.
They think it justified.

931
01:21:08,943 --> 01:21:11,820
Because of the Church's attacks
on men of science in the past.

932
01:21:11,987 --> 01:21:13,655
And it's true.

933
01:21:14,281 --> 01:21:15,573
Since the days of Galileo

934
01:21:15,741 --> 01:21:19,494
this Church has tried to slow
the relentless march of progress

935
01:21:19,662 --> 01:21:21,955
sometimes with misguided means.

936
01:21:23,416 --> 01:21:27,085
But science and religion
are not enemies.

937
01:21:27,253 --> 01:21:28,920
There are simply some things

938
01:21:29,088 --> 01:21:32,173
that science is just too young
to understand.

939
01:21:32,341 --> 01:21:37,429
So the Church pleads,
"Stop. Slow down. Think. Wait."

940
01:21:37,930 --> 01:21:40,682
And for this they call us backward.

941
01:21:40,850 --> 01:21:43,018
But who is more ignorant...

942
01:21:43,269 --> 01:21:45,437
the man
who cannot define lightning

943
01:21:45,604 --> 01:21:49,524
or the man who does not respect
its natural awesome power?

944
01:21:50,151 --> 01:21:52,694
The battle is well underway, signori.

945
01:21:53,362 --> 01:21:55,071
We must defend ourselves.

946
01:21:55,239 --> 01:21:58,241
But what if this time we fight
their stealth with openness?

947
01:21:58,409 --> 01:22:01,036
Combat their wicked scheme
with simple truth

948
01:22:01,203 --> 01:22:04,247
and end this brutish battle
once and for all.

949
01:22:06,834 --> 01:22:13,340
We must open the doors, tear down the
blacken curtains and speak to our flock.

950
01:22:13,507 --> 01:22:16,426
If the outside world could see
this Church as I do

951
01:22:16,594 --> 01:22:18,762
looking beyond the ritual
of these walls

952
01:22:18,929 --> 01:22:22,432
they would see a modern miracle.

953
01:22:22,600 --> 01:22:25,602
A brotherhood of imperfect,
simple souls

954
01:22:25,770 --> 01:22:28,480
who want nothing more
than to be voices of compassion

955
01:22:28,647 --> 01:22:32,025
in a world spinning out of control.

956
01:22:33,152 --> 01:22:36,654
Signori I ask

957
01:22:37,615 --> 01:22:39,658
I pray

958
01:22:39,825 --> 01:22:42,160
that you break this conclave.

959
01:22:43,037 --> 01:22:45,413
Open the doors

960
01:22:45,581 --> 01:22:47,832
evacuate St. Peter's Square...

961
01:22:48,042 --> 01:22:50,960
and tell the world the truth.

962
01:23:24,662 --> 01:23:26,538
Oh, my God.

963
01:23:26,706 --> 01:23:28,623
Get him down!

964
01:23:29,834 --> 01:23:31,626
No!

965
01:23:40,803 --> 01:23:42,679
There, there, that chain.
On that pulley.

966
01:23:42,847 --> 01:23:44,645
This bench. Get this pew up here.
Make a ladder.

967
01:26:52,328 --> 01:26:53,411
My son

968
01:26:55,164 --> 01:26:57,874
God answers all prayers,

969
01:26:59,168 --> 01:27:01,002
but sometimes his answer is no.

970
01:27:03,214 --> 01:27:05,840
The College will not break conclave.

971
01:27:07,134 --> 01:27:08,468
May I suggest

972
01:27:09,303 --> 01:27:10,679
you direct your energies

973
01:27:10,846 --> 01:27:14,516
to helping the Swiss Guard find
this explosive device

974
01:27:15,184 --> 01:27:16,851
if it exists.

975
01:27:18,145 --> 01:27:19,688
And leave Church leadership

976
01:27:22,274 --> 01:27:23,858
to its leaders.

977
01:27:37,039 --> 01:27:38,206
Eminence.

978
01:27:40,876 --> 01:27:45,213
There is a growing fear
that without the four preferiti

979
01:27:45,798 --> 01:27:50,969
a two-thirds majority
for any candidate will not be possible.

980
01:27:51,137 --> 01:27:53,972
- Unless...
- Speak plainly.

981
01:27:55,057 --> 01:27:56,683
It is the recommendation of many

982
01:27:56,851 --> 01:28:00,478
that you ask to be removed
from your post as Great Elector

983
01:28:01,522 --> 01:28:05,108
thereby making yourself eligible

984
01:28:05,276 --> 01:28:08,403
to wear the Ring of the Fisherman.

985
01:28:09,572 --> 01:28:11,406
Well

986
01:28:11,574 --> 01:28:13,867
if it is God's will

987
01:28:21,125 --> 01:28:22,876
may his will be done.

988
01:28:51,280 --> 01:28:53,615
Signore, are you okay?

989
01:29:18,599 --> 01:29:21,476
Those journals are private property.
I demand you return them.

990
01:29:21,644 --> 01:29:25,230
They're material evidence
in a Vatican investigation.

991
01:29:27,233 --> 01:29:29,442
I am an Italian citizen.
My rights do not end

992
01:29:29,610 --> 01:29:32,404
- just because I crossed to the other...
- This is not Italy.

993
01:29:32,571 --> 01:29:34,614
It's not even Rome,
it's the Vatican.

994
01:29:34,782 --> 01:29:36,574
A country of its own
with its own laws.

995
01:29:36,742 --> 01:29:40,078
And when those journals passed
the border, they became my property.

996
01:29:40,246 --> 01:29:42,080
I will give them back to you

997
01:29:42,248 --> 01:29:45,583
when I've decided they contain
nothing of value to the investigation.

998
01:29:45,751 --> 01:29:48,878
Do you have something to hide,
Comandante Richter?

999
01:29:51,382 --> 01:29:53,675
Do you, Dr. Vetra?

1000
01:30:15,531 --> 01:30:18,491
Were it up to me,
it would not be this way.

1001
01:30:19,910 --> 01:30:22,579
It's a sin to kill with pain.

1002
01:30:23,706 --> 01:30:25,540
It's a sin to kill without reason.

1003
01:30:29,420 --> 01:30:30,962
Father...

1004
01:30:32,590 --> 01:30:33,965
they make me a sinner.

1005
01:31:13,756 --> 01:31:16,341
Saint Teresa on fire.

1006
01:31:19,428 --> 01:31:21,096
Professor Langdon?

1007
01:31:22,306 --> 01:31:24,224
- What direction is that?
- West, I think.

1008
01:31:24,392 --> 01:31:27,227
"Cross Rome
the mystic elements unfold."

1009
01:31:28,646 --> 01:31:30,939
Piazza Barberini is here.

1010
01:31:31,107 --> 01:31:34,109
Saint Teresa is here.

1011
01:31:34,694 --> 01:31:36,820
Where is the Santa Maria
del Popolo?

1012
01:31:36,987 --> 01:31:39,614
- Santa Maria del Popolo?
- Yes.

1013
01:31:40,700 --> 01:31:42,200
Thank you.

1014
01:31:42,910 --> 01:31:45,036
St. Peter's is here.

1015
01:31:45,204 --> 01:31:47,330
We are here.

1016
01:31:48,874 --> 01:31:50,417
A church with water.

1017
01:31:52,753 --> 01:31:54,546
Wait, wait, wait.

1018
01:31:54,714 --> 01:31:56,381
"Cross Rome."

1019
01:31:58,509 --> 01:32:00,552
The poem must mean it literally,
cross Rome.

1020
01:32:00,720 --> 01:32:02,887
Professor, Commander Richter
has ordered me

1021
01:32:03,055 --> 01:32:04,764
to escort you
to the Vatican immediately.

1022
01:32:04,932 --> 01:32:06,099
Piazza Navona.

1023
01:32:06,267 --> 01:32:10,020
Earth. Air. Fire. Water.

1024
01:32:10,187 --> 01:32:12,147
Cross Rome.

1025
01:32:12,314 --> 01:32:14,482
Bernini's Four Rivers.

1026
01:32:15,192 --> 01:32:18,528
Professor Langdon, the Vatican insists
that I have to take you back immediately.

1027
01:32:18,696 --> 01:32:21,698
The Vatican is about to see
its fourth cardinal murdered tonight.

1028
01:32:21,866 --> 01:32:26,786
Now, look. You can do as they say
and force me back to the Vatican

1029
01:32:26,954 --> 01:32:28,997
where we can all mourn
his death together.

1030
01:32:29,165 --> 01:32:33,084
Or you can show how real cops act,
and take me to the Piazza Navona

1031
01:32:33,252 --> 01:32:36,463
where we still might be able
to stop it.

1032
01:32:39,425 --> 01:32:42,135
Oh, by all means, let's talk it over.

1033
01:32:42,303 --> 01:32:44,971
In 14 minutes, he's gonna be dead.

1034
01:32:50,895 --> 01:32:52,062
This way, professor.

1035
01:33:00,738 --> 01:33:02,489
Yes, Padre?

1036
01:33:02,698 --> 01:33:06,493
At 11:15,
if the Church is still in peril

1037
01:33:06,702 --> 01:33:09,579
give the order
to evacuate the cardinals.

1038
01:33:10,081 --> 01:33:12,165
But with dignity.

1039
01:33:12,333 --> 01:33:16,294
Let them walk out into St. Peter's
Square with their heads held high.

1040
01:33:16,462 --> 01:33:19,130
I don't want the last image
of this Church to be of men

1041
01:33:19,298 --> 01:33:21,466
sneaking out the back door.

1042
01:33:38,567 --> 01:33:40,610
"Let angels guide thee."

1043
01:33:45,992 --> 01:33:47,534
There it is.

1044
01:33:47,743 --> 01:33:49,869
- There it is.
- Professor, I know this fountain.

1045
01:33:50,037 --> 01:33:53,540
- There is no angel on it.
- The dove. The Angel of Peace.

1046
01:33:53,749 --> 01:33:56,042
And it's looking in what direction?

1047
01:33:56,252 --> 01:33:57,961
East, I think.

1048
01:34:09,390 --> 01:34:10,682
Professor, just wait here.

1049
01:34:11,350 --> 01:34:13,101
Stay put.

1050
01:34:49,722 --> 01:34:51,806
Good evening. Can you help me?

1051
01:34:52,224 --> 01:34:54,434
I'm waiting for a doctor.

1052
01:35:10,910 --> 01:35:12,619
Come here.

1053
01:35:15,498 --> 01:35:18,124
Stay calm. Don't shoot.

1054
01:35:55,454 --> 01:35:56,538
Hey!

1055
01:36:11,387 --> 01:36:12,804
Help!

1056
01:36:12,972 --> 01:36:14,014
Somebody help!

1057
01:36:53,387 --> 01:36:55,096
Help, somebody!

1058
01:38:09,171 --> 01:38:10,755
Cardinal Baggia?

1059
01:38:10,923 --> 01:38:12,173
Cardinal Baggia.

1060
01:38:14,468 --> 01:38:16,469
Where was he hiding you?

1061
01:38:16,637 --> 01:38:18,763
The Church of Illumination,
where is it?

1062
01:38:19,390 --> 01:38:22,684
Castel... Castel Sant'Angelo.

1063
01:38:24,186 --> 01:38:25,603
Castle of the Angel.

1064
01:38:48,586 --> 01:38:51,546
Sir, there's news
about Cardinal Baggia.

1065
01:38:52,089 --> 01:38:55,633
The cardinal told Langdon he was
being held in Castel Sant'Angelo.

1066
01:38:55,801 --> 01:38:58,720
If Langdon's right,
that's where the bomb is.

1067
01:38:58,888 --> 01:39:00,638
Send everyone we can spare.

1068
01:39:00,806 --> 01:39:01,973
And you?

1069
01:39:02,141 --> 01:39:03,850
I'm staying here.

1070
01:39:17,198 --> 01:39:18,740
Vittoria.

1071
01:39:19,575 --> 01:39:21,076
- You're all right.
- I'm all right.

1072
01:39:21,243 --> 01:39:22,827
What about you? I just heard.

1073
01:39:22,995 --> 01:39:24,371
I'm all right, I'm okay.

1074
01:39:30,628 --> 01:39:33,922
Robert, we can't trust Richter.
He took Silvano's journals.

1075
01:39:34,090 --> 01:39:36,800
There must be something in there
he doesn't want us to see.

1076
01:39:36,967 --> 01:39:38,760
The head of the Swiss Guard.

1077
01:39:40,179 --> 01:39:43,264
Castel Sant'Angelo, it's close enough,
so the signal from that camera

1078
01:39:43,432 --> 01:39:45,183
could still reach the Vatican.

1079
01:39:47,103 --> 01:39:49,938
The Church of Illumination
is somewhere here.

1080
01:39:50,106 --> 01:39:52,399
Your canister is inside it.

1081
01:40:12,753 --> 01:40:14,212
Come with me.

1082
01:40:18,134 --> 01:40:21,761
For 400 years, the Illuminati
met right under the Church's nose.

1083
01:40:21,929 --> 01:40:25,390
The Vatican used this as a hideout
and as a prison for their enemies.

1084
01:40:25,558 --> 01:40:30,437
If the explosion happens here, would
the blast radius take out the Vatican?

1085
01:40:30,604 --> 01:40:32,647
And part of Rome along with it.

1086
01:40:34,692 --> 01:40:36,067
Go on.

1087
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:52,834
They're pointing to it.
The angels.

1088
01:40:53,002 --> 01:40:54,961
The canister must be down there.
Come on.

1089
01:41:43,344 --> 01:41:45,679
- Where are they going?
- To search the outer castle.

1090
01:41:45,846 --> 01:41:48,181
No, no. It has to be here!

1091
01:41:53,229 --> 01:41:55,021
Robert, it's a dead end.

1092
01:41:55,189 --> 01:41:57,232
No, it's not.

1093
01:41:57,400 --> 01:41:59,776
See if you can find a flashlight.

1094
01:42:16,711 --> 01:42:19,129
All of these stones
are rectangular granite.

1095
01:42:19,296 --> 01:42:22,382
Except right here. What is this?

1096
01:42:26,095 --> 01:42:27,303
It's a pentagram.

1097
01:42:27,722 --> 01:42:28,805
An eye

1098
01:42:29,515 --> 01:42:31,099
that leads to.

1099
01:42:31,267 --> 01:42:32,767
Nowhere.

1100
01:42:41,944 --> 01:42:43,194
Robert?

1101
01:42:45,114 --> 01:42:47,615
These walls overlap
and there's a passageway back here.

1102
01:42:47,783 --> 01:42:49,326
Here, let me have the flashlight.

1103
01:43:13,142 --> 01:43:16,269
It's a passageway
that leads to the Vatican.

1104
01:43:16,437 --> 01:43:17,979
An ancient escape route.

1105
01:43:20,816 --> 01:43:21,858
My God.

1106
01:43:24,820 --> 01:43:26,154
Here.

1107
01:43:28,407 --> 01:43:30,325
Look.

1108
01:43:52,056 --> 01:43:54,557
This would be the perfect place
for the Illuminati to blow...

1109
01:43:54,725 --> 01:43:55,767
the whole building up.

1110
01:43:55,935 --> 01:43:57,977
Here. Here.

1111
01:44:03,025 --> 01:44:07,028
Get on the radio. Get the word out.
Conclave remains sealed.

1112
01:44:07,196 --> 01:44:09,656
But the camerlengo gave the order
for evacuation at...

1113
01:44:09,824 --> 01:44:11,616
I'm countermanding it.

1114
01:44:17,206 --> 01:44:19,332
This is it. This is their church.

1115
01:44:21,711 --> 01:44:24,713
The canister should be lit
by artificial light.

1116
01:44:48,487 --> 01:44:49,654
It's not here, Robert.

1117
01:44:49,822 --> 01:44:52,615
"A shining star at the end of the path."
It has to be.

1118
01:44:52,783 --> 01:44:54,659
It's not here.

1119
01:44:54,827 --> 01:44:56,828
- What did the poem say?
- Nothing.

1120
01:44:56,996 --> 01:45:01,916
Nothing, it's all over. It was just the
four lines, each one describing the.

1121
01:45:11,510 --> 01:45:12,761
There's a fifth brand.

1122
01:45:13,429 --> 01:45:15,638
It's not an ambigram,
it's just two crossed keys.

1123
01:45:15,806 --> 01:45:18,600
- The symbol for the Vatican.
- No.

1124
01:45:19,435 --> 01:45:20,852
No, the papacy.

1125
01:45:21,020 --> 01:45:22,437
They intend to kill him.

1126
01:45:22,605 --> 01:45:25,231
Before they destroy the Vatican,
they're gonna kill

1127
01:45:25,399 --> 01:45:28,026
- and brand the pope himself.
- There is no pope.

1128
01:45:28,194 --> 01:45:29,819
Tempe sede vacante.

1129
01:45:29,987 --> 01:45:31,946
Il camerlengo.

1130
01:45:33,866 --> 01:45:36,618
- We have to warn him.
- Take a step back, please.

1131
01:45:37,745 --> 01:45:40,288
Take your cell phone
from your pocket.

1132
01:45:43,542 --> 01:45:45,043
Throw it in the fire.

1133
01:45:56,180 --> 01:45:57,597
Murderer.

1134
01:45:57,765 --> 01:46:00,308
You know, when they call me...

1135
01:46:00,559 --> 01:46:01,935
and they all call me

1136
01:46:02,561 --> 01:46:05,105
it is so important to them
that I know

1137
01:46:05,272 --> 01:46:07,982
that what they ask
is the Lord's will.

1138
01:46:08,150 --> 01:46:10,985
Or Allah's, or Yahweh's.

1139
01:46:12,405 --> 01:46:14,322
And I suppose they're right.

1140
01:46:18,703 --> 01:46:22,372
Because if he was not vengeful,
I would not exist, now would I?

1141
01:46:23,165 --> 01:46:25,750
I've had several chances
to eliminate you tonight.

1142
01:46:25,918 --> 01:46:28,128
You're still alive
because you have no weapon

1143
01:46:28,295 --> 01:46:31,381
and they didn't ask me to kill you,
but if you pursue me

1144
01:46:31,549 --> 01:46:33,675
it is another matter.

1145
01:46:40,391 --> 01:46:41,683
Be careful.

1146
01:46:42,268 --> 01:46:44,394
These are men of God.

1147
01:46:56,907 --> 01:46:58,658
The camerlengo.

1148
01:47:19,263 --> 01:47:21,556
- Camerlengo will grant you audience.
- Good.

1149
01:47:21,932 --> 01:47:23,850
I'd like to see him alone.

1150
01:47:25,728 --> 01:47:28,897
That's impossible, sir.
No one sees the camerlengo alone.

1151
01:47:29,065 --> 01:47:31,274
Have you forgotten
who you're working for?

1152
01:47:33,069 --> 01:47:34,527
No, sir.

1153
01:47:59,011 --> 01:48:01,096
Have you come to make me a martyr?

1154
01:48:08,354 --> 01:48:10,939
Here. Here. Here.

1155
01:49:37,735 --> 01:49:40,111
- I need to see the camerlengo.
- He is not available.

1156
01:49:40,279 --> 01:49:43,198
- I demand to see the camerlengo!
- He is not available.

1157
01:49:43,991 --> 01:49:45,659
We'll see about that.

1158
01:49:55,086 --> 01:49:57,962
All locked up. Senza chiave,
it's a one-way portal.

1159
01:49:58,130 --> 01:50:00,382
The only entrance
is on the other side.

1160
01:50:00,549 --> 01:50:03,259
No! Hey!

1161
01:50:03,427 --> 01:50:08,640
I don't care who he talks to.
He doesn't go into that room.

1162
01:50:10,685 --> 01:50:13,853
This is Robert Langdon and Dr. Vetra!
Open the door!

1163
01:50:15,815 --> 01:50:16,981
Open up!

1164
01:50:20,861 --> 01:50:22,237
Open the door!

1165
01:50:22,446 --> 01:50:24,072
Hey!

1166
01:50:27,410 --> 01:50:29,411
The camerlengo is in danger.

1167
01:50:43,175 --> 01:50:45,010
He's the one!
He's got a gun!

1168
01:50:49,515 --> 01:50:51,224
- Illuminatus!
- You bastard.

1169
01:50:51,392 --> 01:50:54,060
- Illuminatus!
- Sanctimonious bastard!

1170
01:51:03,696 --> 01:51:05,113
Order the evacuation.

1171
01:51:05,281 --> 01:51:07,073
We only have 19 minutes.

1172
01:51:11,412 --> 01:51:13,163
Here, he's...

1173
01:51:13,331 --> 01:51:15,332
Get the helicopter
for the older cardinals.

1174
01:51:15,499 --> 01:51:16,875
Yes, sir.

1175
01:51:29,889 --> 01:51:31,222
Robert?

1176
01:51:31,390 --> 01:51:34,684
The brand, the symbol,
could it have another meaning?

1177
01:51:40,691 --> 01:51:43,443
Crossed keys.
But those are upside down.

1178
01:51:44,070 --> 01:51:45,570
St. Peter.

1179
01:51:46,781 --> 01:51:48,531
The first pope

1180
01:51:49,408 --> 01:51:51,117
was crucified upside down.

1181
01:51:51,285 --> 01:51:53,828
- On Vatican Hill.
- A few hundred feet below us.

1182
01:51:53,996 --> 01:51:55,330
Necropolis, city of the dead.

1183
01:51:55,498 --> 01:51:57,916
"Upon this rock
I will build my church."

1184
01:51:58,084 --> 01:52:00,960
Or bring it down upon itself.

1185
01:52:01,837 --> 01:52:04,839
The bomb is in St. Peter's tomb.

1186
01:52:20,022 --> 01:52:21,523
The grid is still cycling.

1187
01:52:21,691 --> 01:52:24,067
The power to this section
must be down.

1188
01:53:22,376 --> 01:53:25,211
It must be here. It must be.

1189
01:53:36,724 --> 01:53:38,475
Don't touch it.

1190
01:53:39,602 --> 01:53:41,686
We have seven minutes.

1191
01:53:47,151 --> 01:53:49,486
Robert, hold this.

1192
01:54:30,569 --> 01:54:32,570
It's cold down here, isn't it?

1193
01:54:32,738 --> 01:54:34,072
What's wrong?

1194
01:54:34,657 --> 01:54:37,033
Cold decreases battery life.

1195
01:54:39,161 --> 01:54:40,996
We may have less than five minutes.

1196
01:54:41,664 --> 01:54:42,998
So?

1197
01:54:43,165 --> 01:54:45,750
If I pull the power
with less than five minutes

1198
01:54:45,918 --> 01:54:48,461
the residual charge
won't hold suspension.

1199
01:54:50,339 --> 01:54:53,299
We should leave it here
and get clear if we can.

1200
01:54:53,467 --> 01:54:55,677
- At least down here, the damage...
- No!

1201
01:54:55,845 --> 01:54:58,013
- No, wait!
- Father!

1202
01:55:00,433 --> 01:55:02,350
We are live here
at St. Peter's Square

1203
01:55:02,518 --> 01:55:06,021
where despite a bomb threat
and an order of evacuation

1204
01:55:06,188 --> 01:55:09,774
the crowd is actually growing
in size as we await an official...

1205
01:55:09,942 --> 01:55:11,860
announcement
from the Vatican spokesman

1206
01:55:12,028 --> 01:55:14,029
as to the exact nature
of the threat

1207
01:55:14,196 --> 01:55:17,782
and whether or not they
are treating it as a credible danger.

1208
01:55:25,416 --> 01:55:26,624
This way.

1209
01:55:59,450 --> 01:56:01,368
A bomb?

1210
01:56:06,082 --> 01:56:09,918
Roberto, there's an emergency.
I'll take her up alone.

1211
01:56:14,006 --> 01:56:15,757
He's got clearance.

1212
01:56:40,992 --> 01:56:42,909
Oh, my God.

1213
01:58:44,448 --> 01:58:45,824
Get down!

1214
02:01:38,622 --> 02:01:40,707
Cardinal Strauss?

1215
02:01:41,000 --> 02:01:44,919
It was the camerlengo.
He saved us all!

1216
02:01:45,087 --> 02:01:49,049
He saved the church and he is alive.

1217
02:01:50,009 --> 02:01:51,593
Praise God. Praise God.

1218
02:01:57,350 --> 02:01:58,767
He is alive.

1219
02:01:58,934 --> 02:02:02,437
He sacrificed himself for all of us.

1220
02:02:09,445 --> 02:02:11,654
It's so incredible. He survived.

1221
02:02:30,508 --> 02:02:34,469
You know, the worst thing
we thought would happen

1222
02:02:34,637 --> 02:02:38,640
was that our work would fall into
the hands of the energy companies.

1223
02:02:40,851 --> 02:02:43,144
We thought
we could change the world.

1224
02:02:43,688 --> 02:02:44,896
So naive.

1225
02:02:45,064 --> 02:02:48,692
No, no. Not naive.

1226
02:02:48,859 --> 02:02:50,694
Innocent, maybe.

1227
02:02:50,861 --> 02:02:53,154
But that's not a crime.

1228
02:02:54,532 --> 02:02:56,658
I'm not so sure.

1229
02:02:58,244 --> 02:03:00,745
Go back to work.

1230
02:03:01,664 --> 02:03:03,748
Change the world.

1231
02:03:22,685 --> 02:03:25,729
A gift. Do you understand
what I'm saying?

1232
02:03:25,896 --> 02:03:28,732
For Catholics, for everyone.

1233
02:03:28,899 --> 02:03:32,485
Camerlengo's age
shouldn't be an obstacle.

1234
02:03:32,653 --> 02:03:34,863
Signori,
you are no doubt aware

1235
02:03:35,031 --> 02:03:38,700
that by holy law the man is ineligible
for election to the papacy.

1236
02:03:38,868 --> 02:03:40,744
He is not a cardinal, he is a priest.

1237
02:03:40,911 --> 02:03:42,620
He is of insufficient age.

1238
02:03:42,788 --> 02:03:45,915
Well, maybe there's a way
we could consider the possibilities.

1239
02:03:46,083 --> 02:03:50,712
I am sorry. The protocols of conclave
are not subject to modification.

1240
02:03:50,880 --> 02:03:52,797
I will not call a ballot on this matter.

1241
02:03:52,965 --> 02:03:55,800
But, signore
you would not call the ballot.

1242
02:03:55,968 --> 02:03:57,260
Surely you remember.

1243
02:03:57,428 --> 02:04:00,221
You gave up your post
as Great Elector.

1244
02:04:00,389 --> 02:04:02,557
They are singing
in St. Peter's Square.

1245
02:04:02,725 --> 02:04:05,435
And what happened here tonight
transcends our laws.

1246
02:04:05,603 --> 02:04:06,644
Does it?

1247
02:04:06,812 --> 02:04:09,939
Is it God's will
that we give ourselves over to frenzy?

1248
02:04:10,107 --> 02:04:11,733
Discard the rules of the Church?

1249
02:04:11,901 --> 02:04:14,486
Perhaps we need not discard them.

1250
02:04:15,279 --> 02:04:21,201
Signore, I am thinking now of Romano
Pontifici Eligendo, Numero Sessanta...

1251
02:04:21,369 --> 02:04:23,161
Acclamation by Adoration.

1252
02:04:24,580 --> 02:04:27,666
If the Holy Spirit speaks
through us

1253
02:04:27,833 --> 02:04:30,210
and we call a man's name
out loud...

1254
02:04:30,378 --> 02:04:33,004
That is election by adoration.

1255
02:04:33,172 --> 02:04:35,590
- He's God's choice.
- Yes.

1256
02:04:35,758 --> 02:04:40,762
And the candidate need only be
an ordained member of the clergy

1257
02:04:40,930 --> 02:04:45,642
present in the Sistine Chapel
at the moment of his election.

1258
02:04:53,693 --> 02:04:55,193
I think we have it settled.

1259
02:05:18,884 --> 02:05:20,093
Signore Camerlengo.

1260
02:05:20,720 --> 02:05:21,761
Yes?

1261
02:05:21,929 --> 02:05:25,974
The cardinals ask you to join them
in conclave as soon as possible.

1262
02:05:26,142 --> 02:05:27,350
Me?

1263
02:05:27,518 --> 02:05:29,602
Yes, Padre.

1264
02:05:52,168 --> 02:05:53,335
What are you doing?

1265
02:05:53,502 --> 02:05:56,588
Silvano's journals.
I want them back.

1266
02:06:21,030 --> 02:06:23,031
Richter said

1267
02:06:24,200 --> 02:06:26,201
His Holiness suffered
from seizures...

1268
02:06:26,369 --> 02:06:28,703
but steps were taken

1269
02:06:29,830 --> 02:06:31,498
for safety.

1270
02:06:35,878 --> 02:06:38,880
"Made sure he was watched,"
he said.

1271
02:06:40,383 --> 02:06:44,052
What if he was trying
to give me this key?

1272
02:06:44,720 --> 02:06:47,097
That's the papal office.

1273
02:06:47,264 --> 02:06:49,140
If the pope was worried
about seizures

1274
02:06:49,308 --> 02:06:52,394
he must have had Richter
install cameras without telling anyone.

1275
02:06:52,561 --> 02:06:55,230
To keep an eye on him. For safety.

1276
02:06:57,066 --> 02:06:58,817
Maybe it records.

1277
02:07:09,829 --> 02:07:11,538
I read the journals, Patrick.

1278
02:07:11,706 --> 02:07:14,290
The scientist kept journals. So?

1279
02:07:14,458 --> 02:07:16,167
Well you figure prominently
in them.

1280
02:07:16,877 --> 02:07:17,919
Really?

1281
02:07:18,087 --> 02:07:22,507
Bentivoglio wasn't just a physicist,
he was also a Catholic priest.

1282
02:07:23,092 --> 02:07:27,095
And as such, he was deeply conflicted
about the implications of his work

1283
02:07:27,263 --> 02:07:29,764
and in need of spiritual guidance.

1284
02:07:29,932 --> 02:07:31,766
Like Galileo.

1285
02:07:32,727 --> 02:07:35,979
About a month ago, he requested
an audience with the pope,

1286
02:07:36,147 --> 02:07:37,856
but you know that.

1287
02:07:38,024 --> 02:07:41,276
Because you granted the audience,
and you were also present during it.

1288
02:07:41,444 --> 02:07:44,446
The God particle.
To actually claim an act of creation.

1289
02:07:44,613 --> 02:07:46,448
The blasphemy. The arrogance.

1290
02:07:46,615 --> 02:07:49,200
The Holy Father didn't see it
like that.

1291
02:07:49,368 --> 02:07:51,286
He urged him to go public.

1292
02:07:51,454 --> 02:07:53,371
His Holiness
thought that the discovery...

1293
02:07:53,539 --> 02:07:57,584
could actually scientifically prove
the existence of a divine power

1294
02:07:57,752 --> 02:08:00,754
and begin to bridge the gap
between science and religion.

1295
02:08:00,921 --> 02:08:03,631
His work was not religious,
it was sacrilegious.

1296
02:08:03,799 --> 02:08:08,678
But you saw the pope's position
as a softening of Church law.

1297
02:08:09,472 --> 02:08:13,099
As an old man's weakness.
Your father's weakness.

1298
02:08:13,768 --> 02:08:15,435
You murdered the Vicar of Christ.

1299
02:08:15,603 --> 02:08:19,481
He raised me to protect this Church,
even from within.

1300
02:08:19,648 --> 02:08:23,651
And then you conjured up
an old enemy from the past.

1301
02:08:23,819 --> 02:08:25,653
The Illuminati.

1302
02:08:25,821 --> 02:08:29,949
You found the ancient brands in the
papal vaults, and put them to use.

1303
02:08:30,117 --> 02:08:31,159
To spread fear.

1304
02:08:31,327 --> 02:08:33,745
The cardinals are men of belief.

1305
02:08:33,913 --> 02:08:37,415
Right now, their belief in evil
is uniting them.

1306
02:08:37,583 --> 02:08:40,752
The entire Catholic world
will be united by this attack.

1307
02:08:40,920 --> 02:08:42,837
There is no attack.

1308
02:08:43,839 --> 02:08:46,633
You're trying to convince the cardinals
they're in a war

1309
02:08:46,801 --> 02:08:48,885
so they will choose a warrior
to lead them.

1310
02:08:49,053 --> 02:08:50,178
We are at war.

1311
02:08:50,346 --> 02:08:52,305
We're weak
when we should be strong.

1312
02:08:52,473 --> 02:08:56,309
If science is allowed
to claim the power of creation

1313
02:08:56,477 --> 02:08:58,186
what is left for God?

1314
02:08:58,354 --> 02:09:00,021
It didn't work, Patrick.

1315
02:09:01,524 --> 02:09:04,901
- It isn't finished.
- Oh, yes, it's finished.

1316
02:09:06,112 --> 02:09:08,029
It's finished.

1317
02:09:09,031 --> 02:09:11,866
I've shown the journals
to Father Simeon.

1318
02:09:12,034 --> 02:09:14,327
The moment the doors
to the conclave open

1319
02:09:14,495 --> 02:09:17,414
he will tell the cardinals
what you've done.

1320
02:09:17,957 --> 02:09:20,458
I was planning on doing this alone.

1321
02:09:23,379 --> 02:09:24,796
Put it down.

1322
02:09:27,466 --> 02:09:30,218
But perhaps it's better
that you're here.

1323
02:09:30,386 --> 02:09:31,511
Put it down.

1324
02:09:33,347 --> 02:09:35,140
Put it away.

1325
02:09:47,486 --> 02:09:50,488
Help! He's the one!
He's got a gun!

1326
02:09:54,327 --> 02:09:56,578
- Illuminatus!
- You bastard.

1327
02:09:56,746 --> 02:09:59,289
- Illuminatus!
- Sanctimonious bastard!

1328
02:10:14,680 --> 02:10:17,682
And get the helicopter
for the older cardinals, right?

1329
02:10:21,270 --> 02:10:22,437
Robert?

1330
02:10:22,605 --> 02:10:25,357
The brand, the symbol,
could it have another meaning?

1331
02:11:08,943 --> 02:11:11,903
I've been summoned by
the College of Cardinals.

1332
02:12:25,353 --> 02:12:26,644
Gently

1333
02:12:26,812 --> 02:12:28,313
but within our walls.

1334
02:13:32,044 --> 02:13:35,755
Father, into thy hands
I commend my spirit.

1335
02:14:29,477 --> 02:14:31,144
Church sources now confirm...

1336
02:14:31,312 --> 02:14:33,563
that Camerlengo
Father Patrick McKenna

1337
02:14:33,731 --> 02:14:38,526
has died of internal injuries
sustained in his heroic fall.

1338
02:14:38,694 --> 02:14:40,820
Crowds of the faithful are calling for

1339
02:14:40,988 --> 02:14:44,991
the camerlengo's immediate
canonization and sainthood.

1340
02:14:45,159 --> 02:14:48,828
The Vatican also announced
the death of three of its cardinals

1341
02:14:48,996 --> 02:14:51,498
in the fire
at Santa Maria della Vittoria.

1342
02:14:51,666 --> 02:14:54,167
As we await the appearance
of the new Holy Father

1343
02:14:54,335 --> 02:14:55,960
Cardinal Baggia of Italy

1344
02:14:56,128 --> 02:14:59,714
one of the four original preferiti,
who, despite terrorist attempts

1345
02:14:59,882 --> 02:15:02,050
at disruption,
seems to have been selected

1346
02:15:02,218 --> 02:15:04,636
in one of the swiftest
and smoothest conclaves

1347
02:15:04,804 --> 02:15:06,596
in modern Church history.

1348
02:15:13,562 --> 02:15:15,480
Professor Langdon? Please.

1349
02:15:32,915 --> 02:15:36,251
A token of thanks
from His Holiness

1350
02:15:36,419 --> 02:15:39,504
and from his new camerlengo.

1351
02:15:40,756 --> 02:15:43,550
We are grateful you saved his life.

1352
02:15:43,718 --> 02:15:46,970
And it's our understanding
that you require this text

1353
02:15:47,138 --> 02:15:49,180
to complete your scholarly work.

1354
02:15:51,225 --> 02:15:54,352
We ask only that
in your last will and testament

1355
02:15:54,520 --> 02:15:56,813
you ensure,

1356
02:15:56,981 --> 02:15:58,898
it finds its way home.

1357
02:16:01,652 --> 02:16:02,736
Of course.

1358
02:16:02,903 --> 02:16:05,113
And when you write of us

1359
02:16:05,281 --> 02:16:08,074
and you will write of us

1360
02:16:08,242 --> 02:16:10,535
may I ask one thing?

1361
02:16:10,703 --> 02:16:12,287
Do so gently.

1362
02:16:14,790 --> 02:16:16,291
I'll try.

1363
02:16:16,459 --> 02:16:18,293
Religion is flawed,

1364
02:16:18,961 --> 02:16:21,796
but only because man is flawed.

1365
02:16:21,964 --> 02:16:25,383
All men, including this one.

1366
02:16:39,982 --> 02:16:41,816
He chose the name Luke.

1367
02:16:44,779 --> 02:16:47,489
There's been many Marks
and Johns...

1368
02:16:49,158 --> 02:16:50,742
never a Luke.

1369
02:16:51,452 --> 02:16:52,827
It's said he was a doctor.

1370
02:16:54,163 --> 02:16:58,166
It's quite a message,
science and faith all in one.

1371
02:16:58,334 --> 02:16:59,959
The world is in need of both.

1372
02:17:02,838 --> 02:17:05,256
You will counsel him wisely.

1373
02:17:05,591 --> 02:17:09,177
I am an old man.
I will counsel him briefly.

1374
02:17:14,809 --> 02:17:16,851
Mr. Langdon,

1375
02:17:22,024 --> 02:17:26,653
thanks be to God for sending
someone to protect his Church.

1376
02:17:30,866 --> 02:17:33,535
I don't believe
he sent me, Father.

1377
02:17:33,703 --> 02:17:35,996
Oh my son.

1378
02:17:36,163 --> 02:17:38,206
Of course he did.
