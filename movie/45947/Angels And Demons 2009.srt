1
00:02:07,189 --> 00:02:11,658
The Ring of the Fisherman, which bears the
official papal seal...

2
00:02:11,859 --> 00:02:15,237
must be destroyed immediately following the Pope's death.

3
00:02:16,829 --> 00:02:19,944
The Papal apartment is then
sealed for nine days of mourning...

4
00:02:20,845 --> 00:02:25,197
a period known as
"Sede Vacante", the time of the empty throne.

5
00:02:28,357 --> 00:02:34,242
Over the last several days, Catholic leaders
from every corner of the world have flocked to Rome...

6
00:02:34,737 --> 00:02:38,846
shocked by the sudden death of
this progressive and beloved pope.

7
00:02:46,245 --> 00:02:47,896
Today, in St. Peter's Square...

8
00:02:48,503 --> 00:02:53,490
the faithful pray that there is
among them another leader who can
unite their church

9
00:02:53,711 --> 00:02:57,610
which has been so riven by change and descent in recent years.

10
00:03:01,627 --> 00:03:03,957
As the body of the pontif passes by...

11
00:03:04,302 --> 00:03:07,199
we see prayers are being
offerred by the Preferiti...

12
00:03:07,756 --> 00:03:13,151
favorites among those being
considered to succeed him as
the Vicar of Christ.

13
00:03:20,735 --> 00:03:22,402
At the end of the mourning period...

14
00:03:22,721 --> 00:03:27,904
the College of Cardinals will lock itself
behind the doors of the Sistine Chapel
for Conclave.

15
00:03:27,939 --> 00:03:31,124
The process by which they will
choose a new leader...

16
00:03:31,427 --> 00:03:33,533
for the world's one billion Catholics...

17
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:36,798
who now find their church at a crossroads...

18
00:03:37,022 --> 00:03:40,184
its ancient traditions threatened
by a modern world.

19
00:03:49,278 --> 00:03:51,628
Attention: Control booth going online.

20
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:56,016
We are powering up.

21
00:03:59,811 --> 00:04:01,948
Attention Category 1 personnel.

22
00:04:02,403 --> 00:04:04,682
Interlock areas are now restricted.

23
00:04:06,616 --> 00:04:08,838
You've blocked all access, Philippe.

24
00:04:09,148 --> 00:04:14,400
You are terrified because you gave
it your all. The accelerator should
never create antimatter.

25
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:18,448
It's only three cylinders under high security. I only ask you to wait.

26
00:04:19,213 --> 00:04:22,852
We can't wait any longer. Antimatter
is only the beginning. We will have free access.

27
00:04:23,367 --> 00:04:26,278
But listen, even with proper calibration, we might not be prepared.

28
00:04:27,453 --> 00:04:29,149
Just call the director. Stop this.

29
00:04:30,724 --> 00:04:33,707
ATLAS underground is now a restricted vault.

30
00:04:34,655 --> 00:04:35,939
Vittoria, Vittoria...

31
00:04:36,412 --> 00:04:37,636
Protons are being loaded.

32
00:04:37,806 --> 00:04:40,229
This will not blast us to the other side, so, please.

33
00:04:41,953 --> 00:04:44,094
Powering on LHC magnets.

34
00:04:45,728 --> 00:04:49,782
lonic stage in 4, 3, 2...

35
00:04:51,097 --> 00:04:52,753
Start the collision sequence.

36
00:04:53,272 --> 00:04:55,798
Vittoria, what did Phillipe want?

37
00:04:56,429 --> 00:05:00,567
He about shitted. We should still wait. What do you think?

38
00:05:00,756 --> 00:05:04,382
It's now or never.

39
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:08,017
Beam stability is good.
Take your places people.

40
00:05:08,186 --> 00:05:10,288
ATLAS and CMS checked.

41
00:05:10,476 --> 00:05:13,637
Trigger is set. Collision is imminent.

42
00:05:18,425 --> 00:05:20,781
Let's hope the heavy ion
guys didn't mess up.

43
00:05:25,343 --> 00:05:27,264
Luminosity monitors operational.

44
00:05:28,153 --> 00:05:30,167
B-Line has no restrictions.

45
00:05:30,406 --> 00:05:32,701
Enable beam capture.

46
00:05:32,736 --> 00:05:34,587
Accelerating the beam.

47
00:05:34,622 --> 00:05:36,440
Stage 1: Line up.

48
00:05:36,506 --> 00:05:38,102
Magnets to full field.

49
00:05:40,067 --> 00:05:42,140
Last P still too high.

50
00:05:42,176 --> 00:05:45,062
We are moving up the luminosity 10 to 34.

51
00:05:45,531 --> 00:05:47,382
Eject particle beams.

52
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:54,243
Fusion commenced.
We are back online.

53
00:05:54,655 --> 00:05:57,067
The merger may be any time.

54
00:05:57,401 --> 00:06:00,984
Particles in transition.

55
00:06:01,015 --> 00:06:05,120
Collisions are fixed and running.

56
00:06:05,768 --> 00:06:08,970
LHC injecting protons: Beam 1.

57
00:06:11,754 --> 00:06:13,143
Lock the feedback systems.

58
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,749
Particles at 99% the speed of light.

59
00:06:17,304 --> 00:06:19,193
Colliding stable beams.

60
00:06:19,714 --> 00:06:21,437
Enact injection kicker.

61
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,604
We have a signal on the
luminosity monitors.

62
00:06:26,983 --> 00:06:28,845
We have events.

63
00:06:34,456 --> 00:06:35,778
Protons are moving.

64
00:06:54,756 --> 00:06:56,781
We have created antimatter.

65
00:07:01,263 --> 00:07:04,089
The unknown has been created.

66
00:07:12,317 --> 00:07:14,037
Silvano, we have succeeded.

67
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:22,981
We are now in God's hands, Vittoria.

68
00:07:23,893 --> 00:07:25,134
I am on my way.

69
00:08:24,225 --> 00:08:25,772
Silvano?

70
00:08:26,321 --> 00:08:27,162
Silvano!

71
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:50,884
Oh, God.

72
00:08:52,214 --> 00:08:56,884
Help! Aiuto! Aiuto!

73
00:09:52,211 --> 00:09:56,653
A swim might help your jet lag.
- I beg your pardon?

74
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:59,355
The bags under your eyes.
It's five in the morning...

75
00:10:00,193 --> 00:10:01,583
and you're from the Vatican.

76
00:10:03,063 --> 00:10:04,906
Crossed keys under the Triregnum.

77
00:10:05,373 --> 00:10:06,832
It's a papal symbol.

78
00:10:10,551 --> 00:10:13,845
Claudio Vicenze.
Corpo della Gendarmeria Vaticano.

79
00:10:14,747 --> 00:10:16,052
Vatican Police?

80
00:10:17,686 --> 00:10:19,597
I was expecting another letter.

81
00:10:21,654 --> 00:10:23,562
My request for access to your archives.

82
00:10:25,177 --> 00:10:26,528
Shouldn't you be in Rome?

83
00:10:27,267 --> 00:10:28,970
Kind of a busy time for you guys, huh?

84
00:10:29,172 --> 00:10:30,794
In fact, I was in New York.

85
00:10:31,175 --> 00:10:34,743
A detail to the UN.
I received a phone call in the middle of the night.

86
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:39,262
"Find Professor Robert Langdon.
A matter of great urgency. "

87
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:42,593
They said to show you this.

88
00:10:53,019 --> 00:10:56,480
The Illuminati? They disappeared hundreds of years ago.
- Did they?

89
00:10:56,766 --> 00:11:01,192
Look at that again. It's an ambigram.
It's the same image, forward and backward.

90
00:11:01,354 --> 00:11:03,761
Now, that's common for a symbol
like a Yin and Yang

91
00:11:03,821 --> 00:11:04,983
or a swastika but...that's a word.

92
00:11:05,664 --> 00:11:10,168
That Illuminati ambigramatic symbol
has been considered a myth for 400 years.

93
00:11:10,679 --> 00:11:15,581
Supposedly, in the 16th century, some
artist created it as a tribute to Galileo's
love of symmetry.

94
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:19,601
It was only gonna be revealed when
the Illuminati had amassed enough power...

95
00:11:19,852 --> 00:11:22,256
to resurface and carry out their
final goal.

96
00:11:22,428 --> 00:11:24,321
I wrote a book about it.

97
00:11:24,676 --> 00:11:26,173
Which is why you're here.

98
00:11:26,342 --> 00:11:28,995
"The Art of the Illuminati" by Robert Langdon.
- Part One.

99
00:11:30,034 --> 00:11:33,701
I haven't been able to finish Part Two because
I'm not allowed access to your archives.

100
00:11:39,705 --> 00:11:42,073
It's remarkable. Similar.

101
00:11:42,267 --> 00:11:46,059
Someone is trying to make you believe
the Illuminati themselves have returned to Rome.

102
00:11:46,527 --> 00:11:48,192
Right after the death of a pope.

103
00:11:52,337 --> 00:11:57,473
Four cardinals were kidnapped from their quarter's inside the
Vatican sometime between 3 and 5 am this morning.

104
00:11:57,479 --> 00:12:02,725
Shortly afterword, that document was
sent to the office of the Swiss Guard...

105
00:12:02,770 --> 00:12:04,058
along with the threat...

106
00:12:04,228 --> 00:12:06,283
the Cardinals will be publicly executed....

107
00:12:06,441 --> 00:12:08,825
one per hour begining at 8 pm tonight
in Rome.

108
00:12:19,769 --> 00:12:20,954
The conclave?

109
00:12:20,968 --> 00:12:24,087
Was to begin today.
We have postponed the start for a few hours...

110
00:12:24,089 --> 00:12:25,257
with the story of illness.

111
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:27,828
There are no suspicions...
yet.

112
00:12:28,368 --> 00:12:30,417
What do you want from me?

113
00:12:30,770 --> 00:12:37,232
These criminals, who sent this ambigram,
meant it as a taunt, a provocation.

114
00:12:37,236 --> 00:12:40,999
But Captain Olivetti think if you can use it to learn their identity...

115
00:12:41,004 --> 00:12:44,137
perhaps we can stop this abomination.

116
00:12:47,768 --> 00:12:49,243
Why me?

117
00:12:50,107 --> 00:12:53,534
Your expertise. Your erudition.

118
00:12:53,542 --> 00:12:57,478
Your recent involvement with
certain church...

119
00:12:57,537 --> 00:12:58,975
shall we say.....mysteries.

120
00:13:00,153 --> 00:13:04,433
I wasn't under the impression that
episode had endeared me to the Vatican.

121
00:13:04,439 --> 00:13:05,918
Oh, it did it.

122
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:09,569
But it did make you,
what is the word for...

123
00:13:09,577 --> 00:13:10,825
formidable?

124
00:13:11,287 --> 00:13:13,001
Formidable?

125
00:13:13,925 --> 00:13:16,760
A Vatican jet is standing by twenty minutes from here.

126
00:13:16,765 --> 00:13:18,334
Will you come with me?

127
00:13:26,064 --> 00:13:27,330
Professor Langdon.

128
00:13:27,334 --> 00:13:31,546
You've spent your life searching for
symbols like the one you now hold in your hand.

129
00:13:31,582 --> 00:13:35,911
How much longer are we going to pretend you
have not already decided to come?

130
00:13:42,287 --> 00:13:45,783
If the Illuminati have returned
and are in Rome...

131
00:13:45,912 --> 00:13:48,877
we will hunt them down and kill them.

132
00:13:49,687 --> 00:13:53,548
The Illuminati did not become violent
until the 17th Century.

133
00:13:53,551 --> 00:13:58,136
Their name means 'The Enlightened Ones'.
They were physicists, mathematicians, astronomers.

134
00:13:58,142 --> 00:14:00,819
They were concerned with the church's
inaccurate teachings

135
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:03,016
and they were dedicated to scientific truth.

136
00:14:03,017 --> 00:14:07,019
But the Vatican didn't like that. So,
the church began to, how did you say it?

137
00:14:07,132 --> 00:14:09,084
Oh. Hunt them down and kill them.

138
00:14:09,853 --> 00:14:12,184
Drove them underground...

139
00:14:12,674 --> 00:14:14,967
into a secret society.

140
00:15:03,542 --> 00:15:06,817
-Professor Langdon.
-Yes?
-Welcome to Vatican City.

141
00:15:07,661 --> 00:15:11,235
Ernesto Olivetti, Inspector General
of the Vatican police force.

142
00:15:11,236 --> 00:15:12,214
My pleasure.

143
00:15:12,215 --> 00:15:15,858
This way please. We'll meet in
the headquarters of the Swiss Guard.

144
00:15:16,513 --> 00:15:20,462
I thought you were Swiss Guard.
- No, uh, the Gendarmaria.

145
00:15:20,465 --> 00:15:23,869
We are responsible for
everything inside the Vatican walls...

146
00:15:23,874 --> 00:15:27,447
with the exception of the security
of His Holiness...

147
00:15:27,452 --> 00:15:30,114
-Yeah.
-...and the Apostolic Palace.
That is Swiss Guard.

148
00:15:30,149 --> 00:15:33,343
The police of Rome are here as
well in an advisory capacity.

149
00:15:33,422 --> 00:15:35,526
So jurisdictionally this is...

150
00:15:35,532 --> 00:15:36,632
A fucking nightmare.

151
00:15:43,428 --> 00:15:47,552
Oh, yes. Pope Pius IX's great castration.
- I beg your pardon?

152
00:15:47,555 --> 00:15:53,266
1857. Pope Pius IX felt the
male form would inspire lust.

153
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:58,330
So, he took a hammer and chisel and
'un-maned' hundreds of these statues.

154
00:15:58,366 --> 00:16:01,366
The plaster fig leaves were added later.

155
00:16:03,095 --> 00:16:06,550
Are you anti-Catholic, Professor Langdon?

156
00:16:07,077 --> 00:16:10,123
No. I'm anti-vandalism.

157
00:16:13,569 --> 00:16:16,466
I urge you to guard your tone here.

158
00:16:16,532 --> 00:16:20,509
The Swiss Guard is a calling,
not a profession...

159
00:16:20,544 --> 00:16:25,081
and it encourages a certain civiltry.

160
00:16:25,277 --> 00:16:29,495
Commander Richter, the head of the Guard,
is a deeply spiritual man.

161
00:16:29,501 --> 00:16:31,816
He was close to the late Pope. Understood?

162
00:16:32,268 --> 00:16:34,917
Look, I dont study symbols because I
consider them unimportant.

163
00:16:34,919 --> 00:16:37,334
Ceremony, traditions, heavily mark our lives.

164
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:40,426
I just hope I can help.
- So do I.

165
00:16:41,381 --> 00:16:43,248
You were my idea.

166
00:16:54,087 --> 00:16:56,062
Wait here. Please.

167
00:16:59,075 --> 00:17:01,803
Commander? Commander Richter?

168
00:17:09,268 --> 00:17:11,028
Doctor Vetra?

169
00:17:12,731 --> 00:17:16,614
I'm Commander Richter, principal of the Swiss Guard.
Thank you for coming.

170
00:17:18,975 --> 00:17:20,676
Oh. Professor Langdon.

171
00:17:20,682 --> 00:17:25,120
What a relief. The symbologist is here.
This way, please, Miss Vetra.

172
00:17:27,163 --> 00:17:29,284
The situation has changed.

173
00:17:29,290 --> 00:17:31,789
We received another threat from the kidnapper.

174
00:17:32,235 --> 00:17:35,513
The canister was stolen from my lab
around noon yesterday.

175
00:17:35,518 --> 00:17:38,967
The intruder killed my research partner,
Silvano Paintivolio...

176
00:17:38,975 --> 00:17:41,567
and mutilated him in order
to bypass security.

177
00:17:41,899 --> 00:17:43,947
We use retinal scanners.

178
00:17:44,544 --> 00:17:46,039
They cut out his eye.

179
00:17:47,186 --> 00:17:49,811
Is that your stolen canister, Ms. Vetra?

180
00:17:50,911 --> 00:17:53,819
Where is that camera, number 86?
- It's wireless.

181
00:17:53,823 --> 00:17:56,383
It, too, was stolen. It could be
anywhere inside the Vatican wall.

182
00:17:56,385 --> 00:17:59,617
That canister contains an extremely
combustable substance called
antimatter.

183
00:17:59,619 --> 00:18:02,542
We need to locate it immediately. We evacuate Vatican City.

184
00:18:02,544 --> 00:18:05,107
I'm quite familiar with
incendiaries, Miss Vetra.

185
00:18:05,111 --> 00:18:07,369
I've never heard of antimatter
being used as such.

186
00:18:07,371 --> 00:18:10,640
Well, its never been generated in significant quantities before.

187
00:18:10,645 --> 00:18:13,417
It's a way of studying the origins
of the universe.

188
00:18:13,422 --> 00:18:16,321
To try to isolate what some
people call the God Particle.

189
00:18:16,323 --> 00:18:19,985
But there are implications for energy, research...
- God Particle?

190
00:18:21,074 --> 00:18:23,303
What you call it isn't important.

191
00:18:23,305 --> 00:18:26,909
It's what gives all matter mass.
The thing without which we could not exist.

192
00:18:26,914 --> 00:18:31,490
You're talking about the moment of creation.
- Yes, in a way, I am.

193
00:18:32,163 --> 00:18:34,604
The antimatter is suspended there...

194
00:18:34,605 --> 00:18:38,137
in an airtight nano-composite shell with electromagnets on each end.

195
00:18:38,147 --> 00:18:42,740
But if it were to fall out of suspension,
and come into contact with matter, say with
the bottom of the canister...

196
00:18:42,743 --> 00:18:45,109
then, the two opposing forces would
annihilate one another violently.

197
00:18:45,209 --> 00:18:49,037
What might cause it to fall out of suspension?
- The battery going dead.

198
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:52,052
Which it will just before midnight.

199
00:18:52,263 --> 00:18:54,034
What kind of annihilation? How violent?

200
00:18:54,222 --> 00:18:55,788
A cataclysmic event.

201
00:18:56,143 --> 00:18:59,944
A blinding explosion equivalent to
about 5 kilotons.

202
00:19:00,595 --> 00:19:03,890
Vatican City will be
consumed by light.

203
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:08,116
Those are the exact words
the kidnapper used.

204
00:19:08,448 --> 00:19:10,879
We will destroy your four pillars.

205
00:19:12,623 --> 00:19:17,468
We will brand your Preferiti and
sacrifice them on the altars of science.

206
00:19:18,122 --> 00:19:20,460
Then bring your church down
upon you.

207
00:19:21,306 --> 00:19:24,121
Vatican City will be
consumed by light.

208
00:19:24,533 --> 00:19:28,646
A shining star at the end of the
Path of Illumination.

209
00:19:34,492 --> 00:19:38,224
It's the ancient Illuminati threat.
Destruction of Vatican City through light.

210
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:42,147
Four pillars.
There's your kidnapped cardinals.

211
00:19:42,859 --> 00:19:46,692
You didn't tell me they were the Preferiti,
the favorites to be named the next Pope.

212
00:19:49,153 --> 00:19:50,428
Play it again.

213
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,106
We will destroy your four pillars.

214
00:20:02,313 --> 00:20:03,947
We will brand your Preferiti...

215
00:20:04,145 --> 00:20:04,915
Wait, stop it. Stop.

216
00:20:07,111 --> 00:20:08,344
Brand them?

217
00:20:10,935 --> 00:20:13,472
That's another Illuminati legend.

218
00:20:13,692 --> 00:20:17,590
This one says that there are a set of five 'Brands'.

219
00:20:18,686 --> 00:20:20,182
Each one an ambigram.

220
00:20:20,374 --> 00:20:22,609
The first four are the fundamental elements
of science:

221
00:20:22,804 --> 00:20:24,643
earth, air, fire and water.

222
00:20:24,862 --> 00:20:26,599
Th fifth is a mystery.

223
00:20:29,276 --> 00:20:30,596
Maybe it's this.

224
00:20:31,562 --> 00:20:33,326
You said they'd be killed publicly.

225
00:20:33,775 --> 00:20:37,312
Yes. Revenge. For La Purga.

226
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:39,229
La Purga?

227
00:20:40,748 --> 00:20:43,410
Geez, you guys don't even read your
own history, do you?

228
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:49,792
1668. The church kidnapped four Illuminati scientists

229
00:20:50,007 --> 00:20:52,890
and branded each one of them on
the chest with the symbol of the cross.

230
00:20:53,235 --> 00:20:55,788
To 'purge' them of their sins
and they executed them

231
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:58,170
threw their bodies out in the street

232
00:20:58,351 --> 00:20:59,908
as a warning to others to stop questioning

233
00:21:00,108 --> 00:21:02,315
church rulings on scientific matters. They radicalized them.

234
00:21:02,496 --> 00:21:06,447
The Purga created a darker, more violent Illuminati.

235
00:21:06,627 --> 00:21:09,026
One bent on... on retribution.

236
00:21:09,692 --> 00:21:12,617
And look how they intend to finally get it.
Using anti-matter.

237
00:21:12,885 --> 00:21:16,882
Technology to destroy the church.
Science obliterates religion.

238
00:21:18,525 --> 00:21:19,611
Is there any more?

239
00:21:21,629 --> 00:21:24,254
...and sacrifice them on the altars of science.

240
00:21:24,504 --> 00:21:27,134
Then bring your church down
upon you.

241
00:21:27,368 --> 00:21:30,688
Vatican City will be
consumed by light.

242
00:21:31,237 --> 00:21:35,373
A shining star at the
end of the Path of Illumination.

243
00:21:35,573 --> 00:21:36,924
Path of Illumination?

244
00:21:40,749 --> 00:21:42,549
I need access to the
Vatican archives.

245
00:21:44,857 --> 00:21:46,726
Professor, I don't think
this is the appropriate moment...

246
00:21:46,908 --> 00:21:49,131
Your petition has been denied seven times.

247
00:21:49,324 --> 00:21:51,932
No, no. This has-This has nothing to do with my work.
The Path of illumination

248
00:21:52,537 --> 00:21:55,729
is a hidden trail through Rome itself
that leads to the Church of the Illumination.

249
00:21:55,914 --> 00:21:58,255
The place where the Illuminati would meet in secret.

250
00:21:58,503 --> 00:22:03,728
If I can find the "Segno", the sign,
that marks the beginning of that path...

251
00:22:04,619 --> 00:22:08,239
the four churches along it. It
may be where he intends to murder your Cardinals.

252
00:22:08,574 --> 00:22:13,909
One every hour. At 8, 9, 10 and 11.
Then the device explodes at midnight.

253
00:22:14,527 --> 00:22:17,824
If we could figure out the first church
and get there before he does...

254
00:22:18,013 --> 00:22:19,234
maybe we could stop it.

255
00:22:19,412 --> 00:22:22,480
But I can't find the start of the path until
I get into the archives.

256
00:22:24,018 --> 00:22:25,592
Even if I wanted to help you...

257
00:22:25,751 --> 00:22:27,674
access to the archives is only by written decree

258
00:22:27,861 --> 00:22:30,377
by the curator on the Board of
Vatican Librarians.

259
00:22:30,934 --> 00:22:32,790
Or by papal mandate.

260
00:22:32,963 --> 00:22:35,872
Yes, but, as you no doubt have heard,
the Holy Father is dead.

261
00:22:37,125 --> 00:22:38,707
What about il Camerlengo?

262
00:22:38,861 --> 00:22:41,683
The Camerlengo is just a priest here.
The former pope's chamberlain.

263
00:22:41,856 --> 00:22:45,312
Doesn't the power of the Holy See rest in
him during "Tempo Sede Vacante"?

264
00:22:53,322 --> 00:22:55,593
Fellas, you called me.

265
00:22:57,699 --> 00:22:59,062
His Holiness once told me

266
00:22:59,235 --> 00:23:02,351
the Pope is a man torn between the
real world and the divine.

267
00:23:03,034 --> 00:23:05,293
It seems the
real world is upon us tonight.

268
00:23:06,964 --> 00:23:10,136
I'm familiar with Illuminati
law and the legend of the brandings.

269
00:23:10,770 --> 00:23:13,202
The Purga is a dark stain on this church's history.

270
00:23:14,056 --> 00:23:16,360
I'm not surprised this ghost has returned to haunt us.

271
00:23:19,185 --> 00:23:22,565
Commandante, have you begun a search for this
explosive device?

272
00:23:22,782 --> 00:23:24,335
Of course, but it could be anywhere.

273
00:23:24,493 --> 00:23:26,884
My primary concern at the moment is
the safety of the cardinals.

274
00:23:27,075 --> 00:23:28,761
The Sistine Chapel is a fortress.

275
00:23:29,207 --> 00:23:32,801
As long as the cardinals are in conclave,
your security concerns are at a minimum.

276
00:23:33,798 --> 00:23:35,110
Devote as many of your people...

277
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:38,410
Signore, if you are about to suggest a naked eye search of
the entire Vatican City...

278
00:23:38,598 --> 00:23:40,314
I will tell you...
- commander.
-...I do not have the people.

279
00:23:40,499 --> 00:23:42,579
Although I am not His Holiness...

280
00:23:42,762 --> 00:23:45,766
when you are addressing me you are addressing this office.
Do you understand?

281
00:23:47,913 --> 00:23:50,453
Yes, Father.
- Good.

282
00:23:52,006 --> 00:23:55,153
Now, you said the image on the screen
was illuminated by artificial light.

283
00:23:56,223 --> 00:23:59,909
Might I suggest methodically cutting
power to various sections of the city?

284
00:24:00,523 --> 00:24:04,297
When the image on the screen goes dark, you'll
have a more specific idea of the camera's location.

285
00:24:08,584 --> 00:24:11,775
Dr. Vetra, beside yourself and your research partner...

286
00:24:12,009 --> 00:24:14,260
who else knew about this antimatter project?

287
00:24:15,321 --> 00:24:16,866
No one but the research team.

288
00:24:17,806 --> 00:24:19,605
This project was strictly confidential.

289
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:23,117
But Silvano kept detailed journals. If he told anyone else...

290
00:24:23,762 --> 00:24:26,138
about what we were doing, he would have made a note of it.

291
00:24:26,472 --> 00:24:27,861
And do you have these journals?

292
00:24:28,047 --> 00:24:29,993
I can have them flown here from Geneva in an hour.

293
00:24:30,427 --> 00:24:31,330
Please.

294
00:24:33,373 --> 00:24:34,324
Professor Langdon.

295
00:24:45,690 --> 00:24:47,515
Mr. Langdon.

296
00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:50,485
You are correct that I may grant
you access to the archives.

297
00:24:52,862 --> 00:24:54,210
Thank you, Padre.

298
00:24:54,425 --> 00:24:57,887
I said that you are correct that I may,
not-not that I will.

299
00:25:00,086 --> 00:25:03,040
Christianity's most sacred codes
are in that archive.

300
00:25:04,406 --> 00:25:07,420
Given your recent entanglement
with the church...

301
00:25:07,626 --> 00:25:11,481
there is a question I'd like to ask you first,
here, in the office of His Holiness.

302
00:25:18,835 --> 00:25:20,077
Do you believe in God, Sir?

303
00:25:23,924 --> 00:25:27,843
Father, I simply believe that religion...

304
00:25:28,059 --> 00:25:30,555
I did not ask you if you believe what man says about God.

305
00:25:31,436 --> 00:25:32,873
I asked you if you believe in God.

306
00:25:36,157 --> 00:25:37,553
I'm an academic.

307
00:25:38,865 --> 00:25:43,177
My mind tells me I
will never understand God.

308
00:25:44,366 --> 00:25:45,605
And your heart?

309
00:25:48,517 --> 00:25:50,377
Tells me I'm not meant to.

310
00:25:52,134 --> 00:25:55,180
Faith is a gift that I have yet to receive.

311
00:26:01,891 --> 00:26:03,647
Be delicate with our treasures.

312
00:26:11,078 --> 00:26:12,787
The archives are this way.
- Professor Langdon?

313
00:26:15,165 --> 00:26:17,889
If this path really leads to the Church of Illumination...

314
00:26:18,311 --> 00:26:20,249
that may be where they've hidden the antimatter.

315
00:26:20,435 --> 00:26:22,253
The shining star at the end
of the path. I thought so, too.

316
00:26:22,448 --> 00:26:25,375
Follow the path and we may find the canister at the end of it.

317
00:26:25,558 --> 00:26:26,938
Can you deactivate the device?

318
00:26:27,135 --> 00:26:30,060
I can change the canister's batteries
as long as we have more than five minutes of life.

319
00:26:30,232 --> 00:26:33,412
That would give us another 24 hours to get
it safely back to CERN.

320
00:26:36,576 --> 00:26:38,500
- Robert Langdon.
- Vittoria Vetra.

321
00:26:39,359 --> 00:26:42,845
Are you really a symbologist or
was he mocking you?

322
00:26:43,225 --> 00:26:45,022
No. Both.
You're a physicist?

323
00:26:45,225 --> 00:26:48,166
Bioentanglement Physics.
The interconnective life systems?
-Okay.

324
00:26:49,783 --> 00:26:52,556
Your project...it was to give towards the energy research?

325
00:26:52,841 --> 00:26:53,924
Eventually, yes.

326
00:26:54,126 --> 00:26:57,263
One pack of antimatter could power
an entire city for a month.

327
00:26:58,381 --> 00:27:00,196
Or tonight, I guess, destroy one.

328
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,915
What are we looking for in the archives?
- A banned volume written by Galileo.

329
00:27:05,434 --> 00:27:09,014
Galileo was Illuminati?
- Yeah, and an obedient Catholic.

330
00:27:09,488 --> 00:27:11,688
Who didn't think the church and science were enemies...

331
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:14,130
but just a different language telling the same story.

332
00:27:14,323 --> 00:27:15,885
Anyone of like minds could find the
Church of Illumintation.

333
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:20,381
But he couldn't exactly advertise its location so
he created a coded path.

334
00:27:22,582 --> 00:27:24,936
Richter has started to
turn off the power at various rates.

335
00:27:25,215 --> 00:27:26,454
It will be back on in a minute.

336
00:27:28,037 --> 00:27:31,568
Then some unknown Illuminati master sculpted four statues.

337
00:27:31,918 --> 00:27:34,403
Each one a tribute to
one of the fundamental elements:

338
00:27:34,602 --> 00:27:36,977
earth, air, fire, water.

339
00:27:37,187 --> 00:27:39,443
And placed the statues out in public,
in churches throughout Rome.

340
00:27:39,654 --> 00:27:42,503
Each statue held a clue pointing to the next.

341
00:27:42,694 --> 00:27:45,038
At the end of the path
was the Church of Illumination.

342
00:27:45,238 --> 00:27:47,012
If you could find that, you were one of them.

343
00:27:48,370 --> 00:27:50,910
What makes you think he's going to
murder the cardinals in the churches?

344
00:27:51,248 --> 00:27:56,023
The Illuminati called those four churches
by the special name "L'altare de la Scienza".

345
00:27:57,364 --> 00:27:59,618
Sacrifice them on the altars
of science, he said.

346
00:28:00,026 --> 00:28:00,923
Exactly.

347
00:28:04,779 --> 00:28:07,197
Oh, wow. Look at this.

348
00:28:31,273 --> 00:28:33,169
Excuse me. Signori.

349
00:28:35,008 --> 00:28:38,250
Cardinal Strauss, have you been informed of the situation?
-Yeah.

350
00:28:39,461 --> 00:28:43,578
My belief is we should
proceed with the sealing of conclave.

351
00:28:43,686 --> 00:28:45,247
At this late hour?

352
00:28:45,616 --> 00:28:47,299
That would be highly unorthodox.

353
00:28:47,304 --> 00:28:50,812
And, yet, was ensured to wrought my power in great elective.

354
00:28:50,855 --> 00:28:52,839
The cruelest honor in Christendom.

355
00:28:52,842 --> 00:28:55,903
I have no personal ambitions, Patrick.

356
00:28:56,019 --> 00:28:58,483
Only those I hold for my church.

357
00:28:58,489 --> 00:29:02,933
St. Peter's church, which is
someday taken at its most vulnerable moment.

358
00:29:02,934 --> 00:29:04,508
And this is not a coincidence.

359
00:29:04,509 --> 00:29:08,294
The church will not fall in a day.
We must evacuate Vatican City.

360
00:29:08,329 --> 00:29:12,794
That is exactly what they want.
Publicity and panic.

361
00:29:12,803 --> 00:29:16,386
No. We must not give them oxygen
for the media fire.

362
00:29:16,456 --> 00:29:19,433
But the people in St. Peter's Square?

363
00:29:19,468 --> 00:29:22,766
Care deeply about their church,
as we do.

364
00:29:22,881 --> 00:29:25,784
Their faith will sustain them.

365
00:29:25,788 --> 00:29:28,357
Their faith will not
protect them from an explosion.

366
00:29:29,990 --> 00:29:33,495
We are all bound for heaven eventually, are we not?

367
00:29:34,464 --> 00:29:37,844
Spoken like one who has enjoyed the blessings
of a long and full life.

368
00:29:38,005 --> 00:29:42,700
Patrick, do not confuse the power
of the office you temporarily hold

369
00:29:42,704 --> 00:29:45,556
with your true place here at the Vatican.

370
00:29:46,975 --> 00:29:50,110
You were a favorite of His Holiness.

371
00:29:50,135 --> 00:29:54,188
But His Holiness is with his father now.

372
00:29:55,950 --> 00:29:57,283
Mea culpa.

373
00:29:57,616 --> 00:29:59,606
Seal the doors.

374
00:30:13,381 --> 00:30:15,778
Everyone outside.

375
00:31:07,558 --> 00:31:08,705
This way, please.

376
00:31:09,739 --> 00:31:11,537
Oh. Beautiful.

377
00:31:15,931 --> 00:31:17,871
The chambers are hermetic vaults.

378
00:31:17,906 --> 00:31:22,100
Oxygen is kept at the lowest possible level.
It is a partial vacuum inside.

379
00:31:22,108 --> 00:31:24,420
So, extended stays are not recommended.

380
00:31:24,936 --> 00:31:28,288
So, don't panic if you feel light
headed at first.

381
00:31:39,681 --> 00:31:41,528
I'll be just outside the door...

382
00:31:41,806 --> 00:31:44,078
watching you, Mr. Langdon.

383
00:32:31,003 --> 00:32:34,071
Conclave will go on without us.

384
00:32:34,285 --> 00:32:37,270
It must.
Now of all times.

385
00:32:37,385 --> 00:32:40,291
May God forgive you
for what you have done.

386
00:32:48,218 --> 00:32:50,421
Father, if God has issues...

387
00:32:50,807 --> 00:32:53,067
they won't be with what I've done.

388
00:32:54,233 --> 00:32:56,660
They will be with what I'm about to do.

389
00:33:17,428 --> 00:33:22,770
It was confiscated from the Netherlands
by the Vatican just after Galileo died.

390
00:33:22,805 --> 00:33:28,196
I've been petitioning to see it for
about ten years. Ever since I realized
what was in it.

391
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:31,732
What makes you so sure that this thing is there?
- The number 503.

392
00:33:31,739 --> 00:33:35,958
I kept seeing it, over and over again.
In Illuminati letters.

393
00:33:35,963 --> 00:33:38,324
Scribbled in the margins.
Sometimes just signed '503'.

394
00:33:38,337 --> 00:33:40,648
It's a numeric clue, but, to what?
Five?

395
00:33:40,652 --> 00:33:43,013
Well, that's a medieval number to
the Illuminati.

396
00:33:43,017 --> 00:33:46,264
There's the pentagram. Pythagoras.
Dozens of other examples in science.

397
00:33:46,266 --> 00:33:47,185
But what about 3?

398
00:33:47,252 --> 00:33:50,603
It didn't make sense, until I thought:
What if it's Roman numerals?

399
00:33:50,607 --> 00:33:54,543
DIII.
- D3. Galileo's third text.

400
00:33:54,578 --> 00:33:58,675
Dialogo. Discorso. Diagramma.

401
00:34:10,027 --> 00:34:13,548
Just a few days with this and I
could've actually finished my book.

402
00:34:13,584 --> 00:34:17,379
And sold dozens of copies
at the Harvard bookstore.

403
00:34:17,414 --> 00:34:19,508
Il Diagramma Veritatis.

404
00:34:19,675 --> 00:34:21,752
Diagram of Truth.

405
00:34:22,257 --> 00:34:24,605
I know about the
Dialogo and the Discorsi.

406
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:28,533
Galileo laid out his theories
about the earth revolving around the sun.

407
00:34:28,568 --> 00:34:31,925
Right. It said the earth was not
the center of some universe with
heaven above, hell below...

408
00:34:32,312 --> 00:34:33,761
as the church had said it was.

409
00:34:33,763 --> 00:34:36,105
So, they forced him to recant his second book.

410
00:34:36,108 --> 00:34:37,281
But what was this one?

411
00:34:37,289 --> 00:34:39,035
This is how he got the word out.

412
00:34:39,036 --> 00:34:41,805
This is the truth. Not what the
Vatican forced him to write.

413
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:45,480
Smuggled out of Rome, printed in
Holland on setched papyrus. See?

414
00:34:45,482 --> 00:34:51,838
That way, any scientist that was caught
with a copy could just throw it in water
and Galileo's heresy would disolve. Disappear.

415
00:34:51,873 --> 00:34:55,043
Between that and Vatican burnings...

416
00:34:55,047 --> 00:34:58,200
it's possible this is the only copy
that remains.

417
00:34:58,279 --> 00:35:00,272
And if I'm correct...

418
00:35:00,321 --> 00:35:04,964
the segno is hidden on page number...

419
00:35:04,971 --> 00:35:06,246
Five.

420
00:35:07,214 --> 00:35:08,872
Yeah.

421
00:35:14,352 --> 00:35:16,642
Do you need help with Latin?

422
00:35:17,232 --> 00:35:18,439
Sure.

423
00:35:25,064 --> 00:35:30,070
Movement of the planets, elliptical orbits,
idiosyntricity...

424
00:35:32,602 --> 00:35:37,159
Sorry. I don't think there's anything that could be interpreted as a...
-Wait, wait, wait.

425
00:35:37,715 --> 00:35:38,896
Do that again.

426
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,213
What is that?

427
00:35:44,865 --> 00:35:47,884
Wait. It's a watermark. And there's a line of text.

428
00:35:48,017 --> 00:35:49,327
Go back.

429
00:35:51,013 --> 00:35:52,617
It's in English.

430
00:35:52,652 --> 00:35:54,200
English?

431
00:35:54,207 --> 00:35:55,569
Why English?

432
00:35:55,639 --> 00:35:58,843
English wasn't used in the Vatican.
It was too polluted.

433
00:35:58,849 --> 00:36:04,386
It's free thinking. It was the language of
radicals, like Shakespeare and Chaucer.

434
00:36:04,391 --> 00:36:05,148
Here's another one.

435
00:36:05,151 --> 00:36:10,272
"The path of light is laid a sacred test."
Would you write this down as I dictate?

436
00:36:10,275 --> 00:36:12,075
Sorry, Professor. No time.

437
00:36:17,543 --> 00:36:19,231
Yeah, yeah. Well, what the hell? Yeah.

438
00:36:35,266 --> 00:36:37,194
Twenty minutes 'til eight.
Where are we headed?

439
00:36:37,195 --> 00:36:40,678
Hold on. Hold on. I'll tell you in a minute.
Here. Let me see that page again.

440
00:36:46,837 --> 00:36:48,422
Where did you get that paper?

441
00:36:49,082 --> 00:36:50,409
We borrowed it.

442
00:36:50,445 --> 00:36:54,681
"From Santi's earthly tomb, the demon's hole..."
- Are you insane?

443
00:36:54,683 --> 00:36:57,714
"across Rome the mystic elements unfold."

444
00:36:58,783 --> 00:37:01,749
"The path of light is laid in a sacred test."

445
00:37:01,784 --> 00:37:04,453
"Let angels guide thee on thy lofty quest."

446
00:37:05,283 --> 00:37:08,134
You removed a document
from the Vatican archives?

447
00:37:08,714 --> 00:37:09,790
She did.

448
00:37:14,458 --> 00:37:16,828
"From Santi's earthly tomb..."

449
00:37:16,832 --> 00:37:19,518
The first marker is at Santi's tomb.
- Yeah.

450
00:37:19,792 --> 00:37:22,334
But who's Santi?
- Raphael.

451
00:37:22,338 --> 00:37:25,063
Raphael? The sculptor?
- Yeah. Santi was his last name.

452
00:37:25,191 --> 00:37:29,034
So, the path starts at Raphael's tomb?
- Raphael's buried at the Pantheon.

453
00:37:29,178 --> 00:37:32,493
Isn't the Pantheon a church?
- The oldest Catholic church in Rome.

454
00:37:51,618 --> 00:37:54,498
I just have chosen my best men for this.

455
00:37:55,406 --> 00:37:56,336
You better be right.

456
00:37:56,339 --> 00:37:58,323
This is one of the busiest spot
in all of Rome.

457
00:37:58,325 --> 00:38:00,836
You can never get away with it. It's impossible.
- The poem implies...

458
00:38:00,841 --> 00:38:03,355
The poem?
Unbelievable.

459
00:38:03,390 --> 00:38:08,017
I'm basing this operation on an American's
interpretation of a 400 year old poem.

460
00:38:08,021 --> 00:38:11,074
Well, the information we have
clearly refers to Raphael's tomb...

461
00:38:11,078 --> 00:38:12,781
and Raphael's tomb is inside that building.

462
00:38:12,787 --> 00:38:17,268
And because the Vatican destroyed all
of the pagan statues in the late 1800s...

463
00:38:17,273 --> 00:38:20,590
if this is the first marker,
whatever clues were here to
lead us to the next are sure gone by now.

464
00:38:20,593 --> 00:38:23,044
The path is dead.
So, this is it. Your only chance.

465
00:38:25,967 --> 00:38:27,424
Seperate approaches.

466
00:38:27,434 --> 00:38:30,442
No closer than two blocks
and no uniforms. Three minutes.

467
00:38:30,961 --> 00:38:33,126
I'll need a set of eyes inside.

468
00:38:38,610 --> 00:38:42,089
Excuse me. Two in with symmetric
black suits and earpieces?
They're hardly disguised.

469
00:38:42,095 --> 00:38:43,824
That's what I have.
- Well, fine. I'll go in.

470
00:38:43,826 --> 00:38:47,077
You don't have communication. You can't carry
a walkie talkie. It's too conspicuous.

471
00:38:47,079 --> 00:38:48,946
Tourists have cell phones, don't they?

472
00:38:48,950 --> 00:38:50,800
No, no.
You can't send her in there alone.

473
00:38:52,049 --> 00:38:53,833
All right. I won't.

474
00:39:05,237 --> 00:39:07,765
Don't look so anxious. We're
supposed to be married.

475
00:39:08,778 --> 00:39:11,300
Well, maybe we're not getting along today, hmm?

476
00:39:13,439 --> 00:39:14,433
Hold my hand.

477
00:39:16,496 --> 00:39:18,613
But don't crush it.
- Sorry.

478
00:39:18,987 --> 00:39:20,732
Nervous newly wed.

479
00:39:24,339 --> 00:39:26,125
Ooh. Look, honey. The oculus.

480
00:39:26,625 --> 00:39:29,112
That could be the demon's hole
in the poem.

481
00:39:29,136 --> 00:39:31,042
Why are the tombs at an angle?

482
00:39:31,258 --> 00:39:33,755
They're facing east to worship
the rising sun.

483
00:39:33,759 --> 00:39:35,109
But this is a Christian church.

484
00:39:35,113 --> 00:39:40,210
New religions often adopt the
existing customs and holidays
to make conversion less of a shock.

485
00:39:40,777 --> 00:39:42,534
Like the 25th of December.

486
00:39:42,539 --> 00:39:45,252
It's the pagan celebration of
the unconquered sun.

487
00:39:45,255 --> 00:39:47,884
It also makes a handy date for
the birth of Christ.

488
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:49,499
Let's check the recesses.
- Okay.

489
00:39:49,667 --> 00:39:52,303
I'll go to the right
and I'll meet you in 180 degrees.

490
00:39:54,818 --> 00:39:56,317
Follow me, please.

491
00:39:57,027 --> 00:40:00,725
Now, the Pantheon, which means 'Temple
of all Gods'

492
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:06,837
was originally built as a temple to all
the gods of ancient Rome, in 27 BC.

493
00:40:07,302 --> 00:40:12,657
Although the building is usually credited
to Agrippa of Damascus...

494
00:40:12,990 --> 00:40:13,946
Robert!

495
00:40:16,367 --> 00:40:17,978
Robert!

496
00:40:20,822 --> 00:40:23,560
It's Raphael's tomb,
but it's the wrong one.

497
00:40:23,561 --> 00:40:24,627
What are you talking about?

498
00:40:24,628 --> 00:40:29,125
It was moved here in 1759, a century
after Diagramma was published.

499
00:40:29,142 --> 00:40:30,903
Where was he originally buried?

500
00:40:31,777 --> 00:40:33,040
Urbino, I think.

501
00:40:33,044 --> 00:40:35,824
Santi's earthly tomb. What could
posssibly be Santi's earthly tomb?

502
00:40:38,236 --> 00:40:43,857
Damn it! Santi's tomb. It must mean the
chapel that he built.

503
00:40:43,861 --> 00:40:45,590
He's not buried in it.
He designed it.

504
00:40:45,593 --> 00:40:49,616
The demon's hole. It's not that oculus.
It's an undercroft. It's a crypt.

505
00:40:49,618 --> 00:40:51,091
Are there any questions?

506
00:40:51,236 --> 00:40:53,230
Yes. Yes!

507
00:40:53,417 --> 00:40:59,934
Did Raphael Santi ever design a chapel
with an ossuary anex in an angel figure
commissioned by the Catholic church?

508
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:04,091
I'm sorry. I can only think of one.

509
00:41:04,801 --> 00:41:06,752
One is good.

510
00:41:06,788 --> 00:41:08,085
Wrong? What do you mean wrong?

511
00:41:08,089 --> 00:41:11,567
It's the Chigi chapel in the Church of
Santa Maria del Popolo.

512
00:41:11,569 --> 00:41:15,015
It was once called Capella della Terra,
the Chapel of the Earth.

513
00:41:15,019 --> 00:41:17,517
Earth. The first element.
That's it.

514
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:19,904
You're certain about the Pantheon?
- We have four minutes.

515
00:41:19,908 --> 00:41:22,798
Back to the Vatican.

516
00:41:22,883 --> 00:41:24,870
Back to the Vatican?
You-You can't.

517
00:41:24,871 --> 00:41:27,422
Commandante, if you care at all about
your church, you'll listen to me.

518
00:41:27,426 --> 00:41:28,573
My church?

519
00:41:30,453 --> 00:41:33,236
My church comforts the sick and dying.

520
00:41:33,243 --> 00:41:36,856
My church feeds the hungry.
What does your church do, Mr. Langdon?

521
00:41:37,933 --> 00:41:40,879
That's right. You don't have one.

522
00:41:41,932 --> 00:41:43,839
Take him if you want.
I'm done with him.

523
00:41:56,220 --> 00:41:59,465
All right, this makes sense.
Look. Look. Look. Right in front of the church.

524
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:01,444
An obelisk. A lofty pyramid.

525
00:42:01,447 --> 00:42:04,024
The Egyptian symbol adopted
by the Illuminati.

526
00:42:04,137 --> 00:42:06,059
If he's going to kill him, he'll do it here.

527
00:42:22,548 --> 00:42:23,878
Eight o'clock.

528
00:42:52,105 --> 00:42:54,743
No. No. Here.
It's an Annulus.

529
00:43:22,311 --> 00:43:24,211
Which one is the Chigi Chapel?

530
00:43:24,512 --> 00:43:26,316
Must be in one of these areas.

531
00:44:30,817 --> 00:44:32,932
Pyramids in a Catholic church.

532
00:44:32,967 --> 00:44:36,093
This is it.
This is the Chigi Chapel.

533
00:44:53,967 --> 00:44:55,814
The Demon's Hole.

534
00:44:59,143 --> 00:45:01,906
Yeah, but it's askew. Come here.

535
00:45:08,452 --> 00:45:10,564
Give me your flashlight.

536
00:45:10,982 --> 00:45:12,325
What's that?

537
00:46:07,720 --> 00:46:13,694
My Savior Christ will be my judge,
to testify that my voice is His.

538
00:46:13,696 --> 00:46:18,156
For I believe that He should be
chosen for the sake of God.

539
00:46:39,715 --> 00:46:45,566
I wish to Pontifex, Dominicus Scolamiero.

540
00:46:54,882 --> 00:46:59,564
I wish to Pontifex, Eduardo Rossi.

541
00:47:00,159 --> 00:47:03,525
They are voting for themselves to
prevent a majority.

542
00:47:03,533 --> 00:47:05,295
They're waiting for the Preferiti to be rescued.

543
00:47:05,330 --> 00:47:08,700
Perhaps we should, as well, yes?

544
00:47:26,504 --> 00:47:31,982
Not until the smoke is white will the
College of Cardinals have chosen a new Holy Father.

545
00:47:31,987 --> 00:47:36,257
But now the Vatican seat of ultimate power
remains vacant.

546
00:47:41,586 --> 00:47:44,939
Get the body out of there. Search
the rest of the building.

547
00:47:45,542 --> 00:47:46,365
Chartrand!

548
00:47:46,521 --> 00:47:46,800
Sir.

549
00:47:46,915 --> 00:47:49,464
Outside a perimeter.
Secure, but invisible.

550
00:47:49,469 --> 00:47:52,501
No lights, no guns.
Nobody knows. Understand?
- Yes, sir.

551
00:47:56,695 --> 00:47:58,343
Is it Raphael?

552
00:47:58,995 --> 00:48:00,992
The chapel is Raphael.

553
00:48:01,415 --> 00:48:03,818
But the sculptures are Bernini.

554
00:48:06,372 --> 00:48:09,563
The unknown Illuminati master?

555
00:48:10,365 --> 00:48:11,998
Bernini?

556
00:48:13,045 --> 00:48:16,518
He worked for the church.
- Almost exclusively.

557
00:48:16,941 --> 00:48:20,200
But the Illuminati were infiltrators.

558
00:48:20,892 --> 00:48:24,007
There wasn't a powerful
organization on earth they didn't penetrate

559
00:48:24,009 --> 00:48:26,525
including the Vatican,
by hiding in plain sight.

560
00:48:31,143 --> 00:48:33,119
Habakkuk and the Angel.

561
00:48:33,779 --> 00:48:36,744
It's the prophet that predicted the
annihilation of the earth.

562
00:48:36,745 --> 00:48:40,816
"Let angels guide thee on thy lofty quest."

563
00:48:44,486 --> 00:48:46,414
This is the first marker.

564
00:48:46,808 --> 00:48:48,219
The path is a line.

565
00:49:00,808 --> 00:49:02,263
Southwest.

566
00:49:02,364 --> 00:49:03,978
It was pointing southwest.

567
00:49:04,308 --> 00:49:09,400
Earth, air, fire, water.
We're looking for a Bernini sculpture
having something to do with air.

568
00:49:09,402 --> 00:49:12,111
The second church is somewhere
southwest of here.

569
00:49:12,146 --> 00:49:13,751
You're sure this time?

570
00:49:13,786 --> 00:49:16,578
I need a map showing
all the churches of Rome.

571
00:49:19,679 --> 00:49:21,373
I could use it now.

572
00:49:56,787 --> 00:49:59,692
The purple layers with these black
crosses represent the churches.

573
00:49:59,866 --> 00:50:03,647
But nothing intersects the line until
it hits...until it hits St. Peter's.

574
00:50:03,652 --> 00:50:05,881
Michelangelo designed St. Peter's,
not Bernini.

575
00:50:05,884 --> 00:50:09,554
Michelangelo designed the Basilica.
Bernini designed St. Peter's Square.

576
00:50:09,688 --> 00:50:12,801
The second marker must be a statue
in St. Peter's Square.

577
00:50:18,093 --> 00:50:20,409
It's ten minutes to nine.
Can you go any faster?

578
00:50:20,977 --> 00:50:23,735
Not unless you want the full attention
of the world press.

579
00:50:31,971 --> 00:50:40,895
No majority in the first vote, but
Cardinal Baggia from Italy is the clear favorite...

580
00:50:40,897 --> 00:50:47,416
Still no new Pope, but Cardinal Guidera
from Spain has the best chance...

581
00:50:47,418 --> 00:50:53,670
The more conceivable candidate could
be Cardinal Ebner from Germany...

582
00:50:54,639 --> 00:50:57,239
Stem cell research is murder.

583
00:50:58,312 --> 00:51:01,021
You condemn sick people to death.

584
00:51:01,028 --> 00:51:02,780
Man is not God.

585
00:51:14,892 --> 00:51:16,548
There. Another obelisk.

586
00:51:16,551 --> 00:51:19,609
Check the crowd. It's almost
nine. He's got to be here already.

587
00:51:53,329 --> 00:51:55,418
Must be a hundred statues up there.

588
00:51:56,071 --> 00:51:59,053
None of them are angels.
Those are all saints.

589
00:51:59,495 --> 00:52:03,531
How on God's name would anyone
create a sculpture about air?

590
00:52:11,202 --> 00:52:12,633
Bas relief. Of course.

591
00:52:12,668 --> 00:52:15,473
It's still a sculpture. It's at the ground.
Look at the carvings.

592
00:52:16,146 --> 00:52:18,209
Look for another having something to do
with air.

593
00:52:37,418 --> 00:52:40,800
Vento Ponente.
West wind.

594
00:52:42,202 --> 00:52:43,180
Vittoria.

595
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:44,765
Here it is.

596
00:52:45,900 --> 00:52:48,753
West wind.
An angel blowing out five streaks of air.

597
00:52:48,761 --> 00:52:50,235
This is it.

598
00:53:51,761 --> 00:53:53,387
Call the police.

599
00:53:54,768 --> 00:53:56,399
Call an ambulance.

600
00:54:06,043 --> 00:54:07,105
He's still alive.

601
00:54:21,541 --> 00:54:24,386
His chest.
They punctured his lungs.

602
00:55:41,244 --> 00:55:45,985
"And You squeezed the life out of a bishop of Rome."
And he's actually claiming responsibility
for the death of His Holiness.

603
00:55:46,722 --> 00:55:48,511
That's ridiculous. He
died of a stroke.

604
00:55:49,506 --> 00:55:52,097
It impliess the Illuminati murderd
him with his own medication.

605
00:55:52,831 --> 00:55:53,647
What?

606
00:55:55,243 --> 00:55:56,309
It's on here.

607
00:55:56,866 --> 00:56:01,119
"With man's solution we
stilled his heart."

608
00:56:01,369 --> 00:56:03,420
"With his own needle
did we pierce his unholy vein."

609
00:56:03,656 --> 00:56:06,791
Did the Holy Father take any kind of
medication by injection?

610
00:56:07,075 --> 00:56:08,092
Tinzaparin.

611
00:56:09,205 --> 00:56:10,868
He had thrombophlebitis.

612
00:56:11,131 --> 00:56:13,306
He took an injection every day,
but no one knew that.

613
00:56:14,020 --> 00:56:15,208
Someone knew it.

614
00:56:15,555 --> 00:56:18,001
Well, he had health concerns
and seizures, as well.

615
00:56:18,703 --> 00:56:20,903
But he took steps to make sure he was watched
for safety.

616
00:56:21,089 --> 00:56:25,103
He didn't want it made public,
so we have no reason to discuss it.

617
00:56:25,285 --> 00:56:27,487
Tinzaparin is lethal
in the wrong dosage.

618
00:56:28,086 --> 00:56:31,683
An overdose could cause massive internal bleeding
and brain hemorrhages.

619
00:56:32,133 --> 00:56:33,614
It might look like a stroke at first...

620
00:56:33,797 --> 00:56:35,732
but in few days, his body would show signs.

621
00:56:35,901 --> 00:56:38,564
This could easily be examined.
- Ms. Vetra, in case you're not aware of it...

622
00:56:38,740 --> 00:56:41,706
papal autopsy's prohibited
by Vatican law.

623
00:56:42,389 --> 00:56:44,913
We're not going to defile his Holiness body

624
00:56:45,098 --> 00:56:47,719
just because of these claims.
- But why would they send this letter now?

625
00:56:47,887 --> 00:56:49,178
In order to cause panic.

626
00:56:49,448 --> 00:56:51,466
"The sun will blind at midnight..."

627
00:56:51,646 --> 00:56:54,032
"and neither police nor professors
can stop it."

628
00:56:54,895 --> 00:56:56,325
He knows I'm here.

629
00:56:56,511 --> 00:56:58,808
Obviously, they were hoping this letter
would become public.

630
00:56:59,127 --> 00:57:02,500
We might be wise to preempt their next attempt
by making an announcement of our own.

631
00:57:02,951 --> 00:57:05,923
To refute this absurd claim.
- That's out of the question.

632
00:57:06,251 --> 00:57:09,408
Cardinal Strauss has insisted
this entire matter be kept internal.

633
00:57:09,578 --> 00:57:11,671
He shouldn't even aware of it.
He's locked in conclave.

634
00:57:11,831 --> 00:57:15,420
His final instructions, before sealing
the doors, were very clear.

635
00:57:15,751 --> 00:57:18,682
Cardinal Strauss does not dictate
Vatican protocols.

636
00:57:18,957 --> 00:57:25,648
And to say, yet, technically, now that
conclave has begun, it is privilege and
duty to control public announcements.

637
00:57:25,860 --> 00:57:28,482
I've drafted a press release about
the incident at the piazza...

638
00:57:28,675 --> 00:57:31,762
but any other statements are
specifically prohibited.

639
00:57:31,957 --> 00:57:36,621
For that, cardinal has asked me to
remind you we have a chimney .

640
00:57:40,586 --> 00:57:42,300
Commander Richter,
the search for the device?

641
00:57:42,695 --> 00:57:47,115
Well, we've turned the power on and off
to about twenty percent of Vatican city

642
00:57:47,300 --> 00:57:49,490
but nothing on the video yet.
- We're running out of options.

643
00:57:49,682 --> 00:57:51,505
How long would you need
to evacuate everyone?

644
00:57:51,672 --> 00:57:54,622
If I pull all my men
from the search for the bomb, thirty minutes.

645
00:57:55,933 --> 00:57:58,959
Mr. Langdon, you have been
right so far about the path.

646
00:57:59,136 --> 00:58:02,252
It's now 9:15. How quickly can you
find the next church?

647
00:58:02,441 --> 00:58:05,868
The lines of breath on the carving
pointed due east directly away from Vatican City.

648
00:58:06,040 --> 00:58:08,206
But there were five of them, so
there's room for error.

649
00:58:08,383 --> 00:58:12,606
About twenty churches intersect those lines.
None of them have names that invoke fire.

650
00:58:12,851 --> 00:58:15,632
So, the Bernini sculpture
must be inside one of them that does.

651
00:58:15,808 --> 00:58:17,807
I'm willing to get back into the
archives to find it.

652
00:58:17,968 --> 00:58:19,907
Would you escort Mr Langdon?
- Yes, Father.

653
00:58:22,772 --> 00:58:25,387
Silvano's journals. The killer's name could be in here.

654
00:58:26,145 --> 00:58:28,314
May I stay?
- Please. Fine. Of course.

655
00:58:30,415 --> 00:58:31,425
Professor.

656
00:58:32,962 --> 00:58:35,492
Would it surprise you to find those clothes suit you?

657
00:58:36,610 --> 00:58:38,733
It would surprise the hell out of me.

658
00:58:56,187 --> 00:58:58,730
The Vatican expressed its sympathy
with the families of the victim.

659
00:58:58,938 --> 00:59:02,082
A tourist from Dsseldorf,
whose death is confirmed.

660
00:59:02,277 --> 00:59:06,022
Vatican police have arrested a suspect...

661
00:59:06,269 --> 00:59:09,332
The investigation is completed.

662
00:59:09,536 --> 00:59:16,199
Vatican will permit access to
St. Peter's again, with strict security measures.

663
00:59:16,387 --> 00:59:19,959
The Vatican did admit that,
where there are crowds, so often follows crime.

664
00:59:20,322 --> 00:59:22,406
We're trying now to get the name
of the tourist who was...

665
00:59:22,577 --> 00:59:24,396
But wait.

666
00:59:25,915 --> 00:59:27,882
We're getting word now of smoke.

667
00:59:28,175 --> 00:59:32,459
Smoke from the Sistine Chapel chimney.
Apparently, there's been another vote.

668
00:59:32,662 --> 00:59:34,251
The smoke is black.

669
00:59:34,435 --> 00:59:36,762
Once again, the Cardinals
have failed to reach consensus...

670
00:59:36,950 --> 00:59:39,324
and the Catholic Church remains without a leader.

671
00:59:48,084 --> 00:59:49,356
What are you looking for now?

672
00:59:50,649 --> 00:59:53,100
Church assets.
- I beg your pardon?

673
00:59:53,910 --> 00:59:55,242
Artwork. It's valuable.

674
00:59:55,879 --> 00:59:58,292
Corporations tend to keep track of their holdings.

675
00:59:58,497 --> 01:00:02,525
The Catholic church is not a corporation.
It's a beacon.

676
01:00:03,372 --> 01:00:06,232
A source of inspiration for
one billion lost and frightened souls.

677
01:00:06,445 --> 01:00:08,503
Sure, I get that.
It's also a bank.

678
01:00:19,332 --> 01:00:21,933
Commander Olivetti said that
I was not to leave you aside this time.

679
01:00:25,047 --> 01:00:26,641
It wasn't me. It was her.

680
01:00:44,075 --> 01:00:46,211
The flow in zone 3 is disabled.

681
01:00:46,678 --> 01:00:48,228
No response on the screen.

682
01:00:48,513 --> 01:00:50,626
Flow in zone 3 again
and continue to zone 4.

683
01:01:01,979 --> 01:01:03,177
What sort of signs?

684
01:01:03,838 --> 01:01:05,435
I'm sorry?

685
01:01:09,927 --> 01:01:13,577
If the Holy Father was
given an overdose of Tinzaparin...

686
01:01:14,136 --> 01:01:16,154
what signs would his body bare?

687
01:01:17,969 --> 01:01:19,613
Bleeding of the oral mucosa.

688
01:01:21,294 --> 01:01:22,636
His tongue.

689
01:01:22,941 --> 01:01:26,256
Post-mortem, the blood congeals,
then turns the inside of the mouth black.

690
01:01:28,269 --> 01:01:30,128
Even after fourteen days?

691
01:01:30,966 --> 01:01:33,664
It wouldn't show up until
at least a week after his death.

692
01:01:38,799 --> 01:01:40,276
He was very important to me.

693
01:01:42,298 --> 01:01:43,824
Yeah, I understand.

694
01:01:48,633 --> 01:01:50,789
Will you come with me, please?

695
01:01:58,897 --> 01:02:02,549
Signore, would you organize a
security team to escort Ms. Vetra
and myself down to the crypt?

696
01:02:02,749 --> 01:02:04,518
Yes, sir. We'll leave immediately.

697
01:02:23,442 --> 01:02:25,335
Do you smoke?

698
01:02:26,467 --> 01:02:28,079
A little bit.

699
01:02:28,395 --> 01:02:31,318
You better sit down before you keel over.

700
01:02:37,125 --> 01:02:41,975
What does this say in Italian?
Ecstasy of Saint Theresa. Right there.

701
01:02:44,547 --> 01:02:47,185
Moved at suggestion of the artist.

702
01:02:47,839 --> 01:02:51,929
Moved? To another church?
At the suggestion of Bernini?

703
01:02:51,965 --> 01:02:53,517
I don't know.

704
01:02:55,850 --> 01:03:00,148
Here. Translate all of this for me, and
I'll buy you a pack of smokes.

705
01:03:00,155 --> 01:03:02,792
I'm looking for a reference of fire.

706
01:03:04,728 --> 01:03:07,735
Seraphim, meaning "the fiery one".
- Right.

707
01:03:10,206 --> 01:03:14,121
His great golden spear.
A point of fire.

708
01:03:15,532 --> 01:03:19,538
Then "woman left completely afire."

709
01:03:19,575 --> 01:03:23,601
The ecstasy of Saint Theresa.
Saint Theresa on fire.

710
01:03:23,606 --> 01:03:26,255
So, this sculpture was moved to this church?

711
01:03:27,906 --> 01:03:30,766
Why'd they shut down the system?
They know we're down here.

712
01:03:31,451 --> 01:03:34,416
If that's the power,
there's no oxygen.

713
01:03:35,371 --> 01:03:37,983
Can we get out?
- The door is electronic.

714
01:03:41,653 --> 01:03:43,407
Well, that's disappointing.

715
01:03:44,777 --> 01:03:47,771
Where are we going?
- To see my father.

716
01:03:48,121 --> 01:03:49,602
I don't understand.

717
01:03:49,626 --> 01:03:52,422
I was orphaned when I was nine years of age.

718
01:03:52,587 --> 01:03:57,053
A bombing in Ulster, the UVF protesting
the visit of a Catholic Archbishop.

719
01:03:57,133 --> 01:04:01,377
The Archbishop felt responsible
and he adopted me the following day.

720
01:04:01,638 --> 01:04:04,184
I was raised by him and by the Church.

721
01:04:04,754 --> 01:04:07,107
He was the wisest man I ever met.

722
01:04:07,568 --> 01:04:11,265
Even when I was young and stubborn,
I wanted to be ordained...

723
01:04:11,300 --> 01:04:14,741
but I was brought up in Italy, so
I also wanted to do my military service.

724
01:04:14,746 --> 01:04:16,678
I wanted to fight.

725
01:04:17,115 --> 01:04:20,105
He told me, "Learn to fly."

726
01:04:20,138 --> 01:04:24,007
So, I joined the Aeronautica Militare.
Flew helicopters.

727
01:04:24,017 --> 01:04:26,419
Bringing the wounded
back to hospitals.

728
01:04:26,424 --> 01:04:29,514
He was a great man.
- Your father died.

729
01:04:30,379 --> 01:04:32,057
Fourteen days ago.

730
01:04:33,249 --> 01:04:35,144
Headquarters, you hear me?

731
01:04:35,382 --> 01:04:38,112
The flow is completed.
Oxygen level is very low.

732
01:04:38,113 --> 01:04:41,615
Answer, please.
- Did you get anything?

733
01:04:41,623 --> 01:04:45,304
No. The walls are lead lined. There's no signal.

734
01:07:59,735 --> 01:08:00,740
This way.

735
01:08:08,646 --> 01:08:12,626
If the Holy Father was murdered,
the implications are profound.

736
01:08:12,645 --> 01:08:14,954
Vatican security is impenetrable.

737
01:08:14,961 --> 01:08:17,503
No one from the outside
could've got anywhere near him.

738
01:08:17,876 --> 01:08:21,592
It was someone on the inside.
- Then we can trust no one.

739
01:08:23,572 --> 01:08:27,518
On my screen, no response
in zone 7.

740
01:08:27,557 --> 01:08:31,539
With all these power cuts,
the battery will soon be empty...

741
01:08:31,758 --> 01:08:34,021
the device will explode at midnight.

742
01:08:55,651 --> 01:08:57,223
Holy Father...

743
01:08:58,163 --> 01:09:02,209
when I was young, you told me
the voice in my heart was God's voice.

744
01:09:02,244 --> 01:09:05,667
You said I should follow
it no matter how painful.

745
01:09:05,674 --> 01:09:07,034
Forgive me.

746
01:09:08,744 --> 01:09:10,369
Please, give me strength.

747
01:09:11,554 --> 01:09:16,165
What I do, I do in the
name of everything you believe.

748
01:10:06,452 --> 01:10:08,287
God help us.

749
01:10:20,754 --> 01:10:23,521
Santa Maria della Vittoria.
Do you know it?

750
01:10:23,994 --> 01:10:26,407
Yes, I do.
- It's the next church.

751
01:10:42,667 --> 01:10:44,521
I think someone just tried to kill me.

752
01:10:44,529 --> 01:10:47,707
Professor, I promise you, we had no idea.
- He knows I'm here?

753
01:10:47,713 --> 01:10:49,837
- Yes.
- You heard me ask permission.
You gave me an escort.

754
01:10:49,842 --> 01:10:54,154
Yes, but we had no idea that portions
of our white zones were crosswired with that building.

755
01:10:55,148 --> 01:10:56,941
Commander Richter was extending the search.

756
01:10:56,943 --> 01:11:00,165
If he had known the archives
were on that grid, he never would
have killed the power.

757
01:11:01,227 --> 01:11:03,287
But there is the other possibility.

758
01:11:03,471 --> 01:11:06,372
Is it conceivable the Illuminati...

759
01:11:06,919 --> 01:11:09,403
have infiltrated the Swiss Guard?

760
01:11:12,046 --> 01:11:13,454
Perhaps.

761
01:11:23,592 --> 01:11:25,439
The journals. Where are they?

762
01:11:28,042 --> 01:11:30,367
Who took the journals from this desk?

763
01:11:40,392 --> 01:11:43,195
Signore, this is unacceptable.

764
01:11:43,692 --> 01:11:46,772
For a Camerlengo to enter the chapel
once conclave has begun.

765
01:11:46,779 --> 01:11:47,856
Forgive me.

766
01:11:47,857 --> 01:11:49,679
There's been a development.

767
01:12:00,237 --> 01:12:06,850
His Holiness Celestine was murdered!
- Is it so inconceivable that it will happen again?

768
01:12:06,852 --> 01:12:09,753
Signori, please, a moment. Please. Signori.

769
01:12:12,223 --> 01:12:14,667
Our church is at war.

770
01:12:15,740 --> 01:12:18,986
We are under attack from an old enemy.

771
01:12:19,345 --> 01:12:21,170
The Illuminati.

772
01:12:21,666 --> 01:12:24,186
They have struck us from within.

773
01:12:24,190 --> 01:12:26,386
Murdering our Holy Father!

774
01:12:26,421 --> 01:12:30,948
And threatening us all with destruction at
the hands of their new God 'Science'.

775
01:12:31,062 --> 01:12:34,309
They call it retribution.
They think it justified...

776
01:12:34,344 --> 01:12:38,491
because of the Church's attacks
on men of science in the distant past
and it's true.

777
01:12:39,199 --> 01:12:44,264
Since the days of Galileo,
this church has tried to slow
the relentless march of progress.

778
01:12:44,299 --> 01:12:46,533
Sometimes with misguided means.

779
01:12:48,042 --> 01:12:50,134
But science and religion
are not enemies.

780
01:12:51,750 --> 01:12:56,420
There are simply some things that
science is just too young to understand.

781
01:12:56,750 --> 01:12:58,596
So the Church pleads, "Stop."

782
01:12:59,130 --> 01:13:00,391
"Slow down."

783
01:13:00,573 --> 01:13:01,921
"Think. Wait."

784
01:13:02,100 --> 01:13:03,965
And, for this, they call us backwards.

785
01:13:05,084 --> 01:13:06,844
But who is more ignorant?

786
01:13:07,174 --> 01:13:09,178
The man who cannot define lightning...

787
01:13:09,541 --> 01:13:12,650
or the man who does not respect
its natural awesome power?

788
01:13:13,739 --> 01:13:15,885
The battle is well under way, signori.

789
01:13:16,619 --> 01:13:18,550
We must defend ourselves.

790
01:13:18,758 --> 01:13:21,327
But, what if this time, we fight
their stealth with openness?

791
01:13:21,502 --> 01:13:24,189
Combat their wicked scheme with simple truth.

792
01:13:24,382 --> 01:13:27,333
And end this brutish battle once and for all.

793
01:13:27,528 --> 01:13:30,342
If the outside world could see
this church as I do...

794
01:13:30,546 --> 01:13:32,441
looking beyond the
ritual of these walls...

795
01:13:32,638 --> 01:13:35,172
they would see a modern miracle.

796
01:13:35,382 --> 01:13:38,953
A brotherhood of
imperfect, simple souls...

797
01:13:39,148 --> 01:13:43,994
who want nothing more than to be
voices of compassion in a world
spinning out of control.

798
01:13:46,249 --> 01:13:48,676
Signori, I ask..

799
01:13:49,911 --> 01:13:51,640
I pray...

800
01:13:52,879 --> 01:13:55,161
that you break this conclave.

801
01:13:55,473 --> 01:13:56,829
Open the doors...

802
01:13:57,979 --> 01:13:59,708
evacuate St. Peter's Square...

803
01:14:00,310 --> 01:14:02,004
and tell the world the truth.

804
01:14:37,532 --> 01:14:39,136
Get him down.

805
01:14:50,817 --> 01:14:53,289
There. There, that chain. On that pulley.

806
01:14:53,509 --> 01:14:54,908
This bench. Get this pew off here and
make it a ladder.

807
01:16:16,929 --> 01:16:18,329
Vatican Police.

808
01:17:20,364 --> 01:17:23,095
My son...

809
01:17:23,130 --> 01:17:26,571
God answers all prayers, but...

810
01:17:27,373 --> 01:17:29,764
sometimes His answer is no.

811
01:17:30,937 --> 01:17:33,625
The College will not break conclave.

812
01:17:34,762 --> 01:17:36,739
May I suggest...

813
01:17:37,138 --> 01:17:42,351
you direct your energies to helping the
Swiss Guard find this explosive device.

814
01:17:42,356 --> 01:17:44,028
If it exists.

815
01:17:45,208 --> 01:17:47,933
And leave Church leadership...

816
01:17:49,659 --> 01:17:51,482
to its leaders.

817
01:18:03,562 --> 01:18:04,792
Eminence.

818
01:18:07,054 --> 01:18:09,331
There is a growing fear...

819
01:18:10,023 --> 01:18:12,180
that without the four Preferiti...

820
01:18:12,185 --> 01:18:17,164
it defers much authority for any candidate.
It will not be possible...

821
01:18:17,479 --> 01:18:19,650
Unless...
- Speak plainly.

822
01:18:20,918 --> 01:18:24,649
It is the recommendation of many
that you asked to be removed...

823
01:18:24,655 --> 01:18:26,897
from your post as Great Elector.

824
01:18:27,172 --> 01:18:33,584
Thereby making yourself
eligible to wear the Ring of the Fisherman.

825
01:18:36,392 --> 01:18:38,652
Well, if it is God's will.

826
01:18:45,727 --> 01:18:47,725
May His will be done.

827
01:19:00,522 --> 01:19:02,443
Here! I hear someone.

828
01:19:04,723 --> 01:19:06,355
Remove the lid.

829
01:19:09,111 --> 01:19:10,165
Come on.

830
01:19:14,528 --> 01:19:16,119
Signore, are you okay?

831
01:19:24,423 --> 01:19:26,346
I know he is there.

832
01:19:26,358 --> 01:19:29,401
Madam, it is necessary that you
remain quiet.

833
01:19:29,417 --> 01:19:33,191
Tell me that I should remain calm.
I want to know what he will do.

834
01:19:37,740 --> 01:19:39,589
Commander, here's Ms. Vetra.

835
01:19:41,067 --> 01:19:43,612
Those journals are private property.
I demand that you return them to me.

836
01:19:43,614 --> 01:19:46,751
They're material evidence in
a Vatican investigation.

837
01:19:49,052 --> 01:19:52,967
I am an Italian citizen.
My rights do not end just
because I crossed the other side.

838
01:19:52,968 --> 01:19:56,194
This is not Italy.
It's not even Rome. It's the Vatican.

839
01:19:56,219 --> 01:19:58,255
A country with its own laws.

840
01:19:58,259 --> 01:20:01,702
And when those journals passed the border,
they became my property.

841
01:20:01,707 --> 01:20:03,431
I will give them back to you...

842
01:20:03,857 --> 01:20:06,888
when I've decided they contain
nothing of value to the investigation.

843
01:20:06,891 --> 01:20:09,227
Do you have something to hide,
Commandante Richter?

844
01:20:12,152 --> 01:20:14,090
Do you, Dr. Vetra?

845
01:20:35,716 --> 01:20:38,070
If it were up to me,
it wouldn't be this way.

846
01:20:39,718 --> 01:20:42,274
It's a sin to kill with pain.

847
01:20:43,524 --> 01:20:45,674
It's a sin to kill without reason, Father.

848
01:20:51,963 --> 01:20:53,325
They made me a sinner.

849
01:21:13,077 --> 01:21:14,749
Saint Theresa on fire.

850
01:21:18,144 --> 01:21:19,125
Professor Langdon?

851
01:21:20,743 --> 01:21:22,895
What direction is that?
- West, I think.

852
01:21:23,090 --> 01:21:24,905
"Across Rome the mystic elements unfold."

853
01:21:27,048 --> 01:21:31,829
Piazza Barba Rini is here.
Saint Theresa is here.

854
01:21:32,744 --> 01:21:34,861
Where is the Santa Maria del Popolo,
the first altar of science?

855
01:21:35,069 --> 01:21:36,285
Santa Maria del Popolo?
- Yes.

856
01:21:38,502 --> 01:21:39,664
Thank you.

857
01:21:40,539 --> 01:21:41,935
St. Peter's is here.

858
01:21:42,801 --> 01:21:44,274
We are here.

859
01:21:46,343 --> 01:21:47,948
A church with water.

860
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:51,201
Wait. Wait, wait.

861
01:21:52,017 --> 01:21:53,395
Across Rome.

862
01:21:55,531 --> 01:21:57,838
The poem must mean it literally
across Rome.

863
01:21:58,065 --> 01:22:01,377
Professor Langdon. Commander Richter
has ordered me to escort you to the
Vatican immediately.

864
01:22:01,609 --> 01:22:06,169
Piazza Navona.
Earth. Air. Fire. Water.

865
01:22:06,603 --> 01:22:08,342
"A Cross Rome. "

866
01:22:08,895 --> 01:22:10,452
Bernini's Four Rivers.

867
01:22:12,091 --> 01:22:15,041
Professor Langdon, the Vatican
insists that I have to take you
back immediately.

868
01:22:15,258 --> 01:22:17,501
The Vatican is about to
see its fourth cardinal murdered tonight.

869
01:22:17,705 --> 01:22:18,811
Now, look.

870
01:22:19,614 --> 01:22:22,439
You can do as they say
and force me back to the Vatican...

871
01:22:22,752 --> 01:22:25,033
where we can all
mourn his death together.

872
01:22:25,230 --> 01:22:27,297
Or you can show me how
real cops act...

873
01:22:27,527 --> 01:22:30,820
and take me to Piazza Navona,
where we still might be able to stop it.

874
01:22:34,536 --> 01:22:36,493
Oh. By all means, let's talk it over.

875
01:22:37,732 --> 01:22:39,425
In fourteen minutes, he's going
to be dead.

876
01:22:45,239 --> 01:22:46,778
Okay. This way, Professor.

877
01:22:55,488 --> 01:22:56,725
Yes, Padre?

878
01:22:57,135 --> 01:22:59,918
At 11:15, if the church is still
in peril...

879
01:23:01,056 --> 01:23:03,157
give the order to evacuate
the cardinals.

880
01:23:04,270 --> 01:23:05,691
But with dignity.

881
01:23:06,505 --> 01:23:09,407
Let them walk out into St. Peter's
Square with their heads held high.

882
01:23:10,371 --> 01:23:14,600
We don't want the last image of this
church to be of frightened old men
sneaking out the back door.

883
01:23:31,504 --> 01:23:32,834
"Where the angels guide thee..."

884
01:23:38,659 --> 01:23:40,452
There it is. There it is.

885
01:23:40,512 --> 01:23:43,080
Professor, I know this fountain.
There is no angel...

886
01:23:43,286 --> 01:23:45,546
The dove. The angel of peace.

887
01:23:46,127 --> 01:23:47,720
And it's looking in what direction?

888
01:23:48,477 --> 01:23:49,719
Uh...east, I think.

889
01:24:00,908 --> 01:24:03,813
Professor, just wait here.
Stay put.

890
01:24:39,900 --> 01:24:41,539
Good evening. Can you help me?

891
01:24:42,546 --> 01:24:44,366
I'm waiting for a doctor.

892
01:25:00,056 --> 01:25:01,234
Come here.

893
01:25:04,328 --> 01:25:05,425
Calm down. Don't shoot.

894
01:25:42,364 --> 01:25:44,324
Hey!

895
01:25:58,035 --> 01:26:00,184
Help! Somebody help!

896
01:26:38,075 --> 01:26:39,381
Help! Somebody!

897
01:27:50,938 --> 01:27:51,923
Cardinal Baja.

898
01:27:52,921 --> 01:27:53,852
Cardinal Baja.

899
01:27:54,518 --> 01:27:55,544
Si?

900
01:27:55,726 --> 01:27:57,372
Where was he hiding you?

901
01:27:58,370 --> 01:28:00,139
The Church of Illumination. Where is it?

902
01:28:01,684 --> 01:28:03,942
Castel Sant'Angelo.

903
01:28:05,494 --> 01:28:07,295
Castle of the Angel.

904
01:28:28,743 --> 01:28:30,918
Sir, there's news about Cardinal Baja.

905
01:28:32,155 --> 01:28:35,016
The cardinal told Langdon he was
being held in Castel Sant'Angelo.

906
01:28:35,794 --> 01:28:37,844
If Langdon's right,
that's where the bomb is.

907
01:28:38,621 --> 01:28:41,072
Send everyone we can spare.
- And you?

908
01:28:41,622 --> 01:28:42,676
I'm staying here.

909
01:28:55,847 --> 01:28:56,901
Vittoria.

910
01:28:58,265 --> 01:29:00,090
You're all right?
- I'm all right, yes. What about you?

911
01:29:00,092 --> 01:29:02,841
I just heard about Olivetti on the radio.
- I'm all right. I'm okay.

912
01:29:08,638 --> 01:29:10,779
Robert, we can't trust Richter.

913
01:29:10,783 --> 01:29:14,409
He took Silvano's journals.
There must be something in there
he doesn't want us to see.

914
01:29:14,420 --> 01:29:16,548
The head of the Swiss Guard.

915
01:29:17,963 --> 01:29:22,414
From the Castel Sant'Angelo. It's
close enough so the wireless signal
from that camera could still reach the Vatican.

916
01:29:24,166 --> 01:29:27,054
The Church of Illumination is somewhere here...

917
01:29:27,586 --> 01:29:29,602
and your canister is inside it.

918
01:29:49,364 --> 01:29:50,805
Come with me.

919
01:29:54,849 --> 01:29:58,020
For 400 years, the Illuminati met
right under the Church's nose.

920
01:29:58,025 --> 01:30:01,181
The Vatican used this as a
hideout and as a prison for their enemies.

921
01:30:01,802 --> 01:30:05,751
If the explosion happens here, would the
blast radius take out the Vatican?

922
01:30:05,923 --> 01:30:08,515
And part of Rome along with it.

923
01:30:25,860 --> 01:30:27,498
They're pointing to it. The angels.

924
01:30:27,582 --> 01:30:29,517
The container must be down there. Come on!

925
01:31:15,833 --> 01:31:18,935
Where are they going?
- Back to search the other castle.

926
01:31:19,585 --> 01:31:21,281
No, no. It has to be here!

927
01:31:25,185 --> 01:31:26,885
Robert, it's a dead end.

928
01:31:27,590 --> 01:31:28,822
No, it's not.

929
01:31:29,244 --> 01:31:31,346
See if you can find a flashlight.

930
01:31:47,987 --> 01:31:50,342
All of these stones are
rectangular granite.

931
01:31:50,524 --> 01:31:52,794
Except right here.
What is this?

932
01:31:57,030 --> 01:31:58,662
It's a pentagram.

933
01:31:58,823 --> 01:32:00,060
An eye...

934
01:32:00,611 --> 01:32:02,042
that leads to...

935
01:32:02,046 --> 01:32:03,202
Nowhere.

936
01:32:12,269 --> 01:32:13,269
Robert?

937
01:32:15,406 --> 01:32:18,474
These walls overlap
and there's a passageway in here.

938
01:32:18,542 --> 01:32:19,923
Here. Let me have the flashlight.

939
01:32:42,407 --> 01:32:45,449
It's a passageway that
leads to the Vatican.

940
01:32:45,484 --> 01:32:47,948
An ancient escape route.

941
01:32:50,231 --> 01:32:51,654
Oh, God.

942
01:32:53,563 --> 01:32:54,651
Here.

943
01:32:57,231 --> 01:32:58,451
Look.

944
01:33:30,451 --> 01:33:31,766
Get on the radio.

945
01:33:31,767 --> 01:33:34,669
Get the word out. Conclave remains sealed.

946
01:33:34,673 --> 01:33:36,632
The Camerlengo gave the
order for evacuation at...

947
01:33:36,793 --> 01:33:38,218
I'm countermanning it.

948
01:33:44,002 --> 01:33:45,991
This is it. This is their church.

949
01:33:48,318 --> 01:33:50,999
The canister should be
lit by artificial light.

950
01:34:14,343 --> 01:34:15,589
It's not here, Robert.

951
01:34:15,593 --> 01:34:17,961
"The shining star at the end of the path."
It has to be.

952
01:34:17,969 --> 01:34:19,720
It's not here.

953
01:34:19,902 --> 01:34:22,057
What did the poem say?
- Nothing.

954
01:34:22,108 --> 01:34:25,065
Nothing. It's all over.
There was just four lines...

955
01:34:25,157 --> 01:34:27,200
each one describing...

956
01:34:36,347 --> 01:34:38,172
There's a fifth brand.

957
01:34:38,268 --> 01:34:40,376
It's not an ambigram.
It's just two crossed keys.

958
01:34:40,377 --> 01:34:42,821
The symbol for the Vatican.
- No.

959
01:34:43,828 --> 01:34:47,013
No, the papacy.
They intend to kill him.

960
01:34:47,048 --> 01:34:49,297
Before they destroy the Vatican...

961
01:34:49,298 --> 01:34:52,195
they're going to brand and kill the
pope himself.
- There is no pope.

962
01:34:52,573 --> 01:34:54,329
"Tempo Sede Vacante."

963
01:34:54,364 --> 01:34:56,065
The Camerlengo.

964
01:34:57,705 --> 01:34:59,964
We have to warn him.
- Take a step back, please.

965
01:35:01,491 --> 01:35:03,713
Take your cell phone from your pocket.

966
01:35:06,863 --> 01:35:08,604
Throw it in the fire.

967
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:20,825
Murderer.

968
01:35:20,860 --> 01:35:22,784
You know, when they call me...

969
01:35:23,434 --> 01:35:24,542
and they all call me...

970
01:35:24,577 --> 01:35:26,156
it is so important to them...

971
01:35:26,163 --> 01:35:29,709
that I know that what they ask
is the Lord's will.

972
01:35:29,714 --> 01:35:32,820
Or Allah's. Or Yahweh's.

973
01:35:33,700 --> 01:35:35,559
And I suppose they're right.

974
01:35:40,003 --> 01:35:44,044
Because if he was not vengeful,
I would not exist, now, would I?

975
01:35:44,080 --> 01:35:46,799
I've had several chances
to eliminate you tonight.

976
01:35:46,806 --> 01:35:50,674
You're still alive because you have no weapons.
And they didn't ask me to kill you.

977
01:35:50,679 --> 01:35:53,828
But if you pursue me,
it is another matter.

978
01:36:00,863 --> 01:36:02,078
Be careful.

979
01:36:02,646 --> 01:36:04,625
These are men of God.

980
01:36:16,687 --> 01:36:17,884
The Camerlengo.

981
01:36:26,306 --> 01:36:28,729
Have you come to make me a martyr?

982
01:36:36,948 --> 01:36:37,962
Here. Here.

983
01:38:01,333 --> 01:38:03,356
I need to see the Camerlengo.
- He is not available.

984
01:38:03,358 --> 01:38:05,890
I demand to see the Camerlengo.
- He is not available.

985
01:38:07,577 --> 01:38:08,959
We'll see about that.

986
01:38:18,207 --> 01:38:20,819
Oh. It's a chiusa chiave.
It's a one way portal.

987
01:38:20,859 --> 01:38:22,981
The only entrance is on the other side.

988
01:38:23,534 --> 01:38:25,651
No. Hey! Aiuto!

989
01:38:33,730 --> 01:38:36,129
This is Robert Langdon and Dr. Vetra.
Open the door.

990
01:38:49,006 --> 01:38:50,870
The Camerlengo is in danger.

991
01:39:04,058 --> 01:39:06,614
He's the one.
He's got a gun.

992
01:39:10,082 --> 01:39:12,304
Illuminatus.
- You bastard.

993
01:39:12,873 --> 01:39:13,451
Illuminatus!

994
01:39:13,707 --> 01:39:15,106
You bastard!

995
01:39:22,944 --> 01:39:23,909
Padre?

996
01:39:23,984 --> 01:39:27,437
Order the evacuation.
We only have nineteen minutes.

997
01:39:31,178 --> 01:39:32,808
Here. He's...

998
01:39:32,893 --> 01:39:35,612
And get the helicopter for
the older cardinals, right?
- Yes, sir.

999
01:39:49,113 --> 01:39:50,126
Robert?

1000
01:39:50,289 --> 01:39:53,048
The brand, the symbol.
Could it have another meaning?

1001
01:39:59,384 --> 01:40:02,582
Crossed keys, but
those were upside down.

1002
01:40:02,617 --> 01:40:04,182
St. Peter.

1003
01:40:05,070 --> 01:40:06,871
The first pope.

1004
01:40:07,974 --> 01:40:10,843
Was crucified upside down.
- On Vatican Hill.

1005
01:40:10,849 --> 01:40:13,712
A few hundred feet below us.
- Necropolis. City of the dead.

1006
01:40:13,714 --> 01:40:16,358
"Upon this rock, I will build my church."

1007
01:40:16,362 --> 01:40:18,888
"Or bring it down upon itself."

1008
01:40:19,664 --> 01:40:22,882
The bomb. It's in St. Peter's tomb.

1009
01:40:37,296 --> 01:40:38,835
The grid is still cycling.

1010
01:40:38,836 --> 01:40:40,741
The power to this section must be down.

1011
01:41:26,408 --> 01:41:29,212
It must be here. It must be.

1012
01:41:40,006 --> 01:41:41,177
Don't touch it.

1013
01:41:42,682 --> 01:41:44,232
We have seven minutes.

1014
01:41:50,142 --> 01:41:52,339
Robert, hold this.

1015
01:42:31,643 --> 01:42:34,093
It's cold down here, isn't it?

1016
01:42:34,097 --> 01:42:35,456
What's wrong?

1017
01:42:35,543 --> 01:42:38,079
Cold decreases battery life.

1018
01:42:40,077 --> 01:42:43,402
We may have less than five minutes.
- So?

1019
01:42:43,437 --> 01:42:46,334
If I pull the power with
less than five minutes...

1020
01:42:46,339 --> 01:42:49,270
the residual charge
won't hold suspension.

1021
01:42:50,385 --> 01:42:53,469
We should leave it here and get
clear if we can. At least down
here the damage...

1022
01:42:53,470 --> 01:42:54,802
No!

1023
01:42:56,265 --> 01:42:57,732
- No. Wait!
- Father!

1024
01:43:00,253 --> 01:43:02,286
We are live here at St. Peter's Square...

1025
01:43:02,290 --> 01:43:05,582
where, despite a bomb threat,
and an order of evacuation...

1026
01:43:05,589 --> 01:43:08,274
the crowd is actually growing in size.

1027
01:43:08,279 --> 01:43:11,075
As we wait an official announcement
from the Vatican spokesman...

1028
01:43:11,080 --> 01:43:13,165
as to the exact nature of the threat...

1029
01:43:13,169 --> 01:43:16,144
and whether or not they are
treating it as a credible danger.

1030
01:43:24,298 --> 01:43:25,202
This way!

1031
01:43:54,370 --> 01:43:55,583
He's got a bomb with him.

1032
01:43:56,821 --> 01:43:57,882
A bomb?

1033
01:44:03,147 --> 01:44:05,704
Roberto, this is an emergency.
I'll take her up alone.

1034
01:44:10,419 --> 01:44:12,469
He's got clearance.

1035
01:44:36,314 --> 01:44:38,876
Oh, my God.

1036
01:46:35,112 --> 01:46:36,753
Get down!

1037
01:49:22,028 --> 01:49:23,352
Cardinal Strauss?

1038
01:49:24,152 --> 01:49:27,727
It was the Camerlengo.
He has saved us all.

1039
01:49:28,320 --> 01:49:31,448
He has saved the Church
and he's still alive.

1040
01:49:32,806 --> 01:49:34,817
Praise God. Praise God.

1041
01:49:40,089 --> 01:49:41,330
He is alive.

1042
01:49:41,842 --> 01:49:44,578
He sacrificed himself for all of us.

1043
01:50:11,766 --> 01:50:14,541
You know the worst thing we
thought would happen?

1044
01:50:15,717 --> 01:50:19,031
Was that our work would fall
into the hands of the energy companies.

1045
01:50:21,773 --> 01:50:23,500
We thought we could change the world.

1046
01:50:24,378 --> 01:50:28,164
So naive.
- No, not naive.

1047
01:50:29,274 --> 01:50:30,745
Innocent, maybe.

1048
01:50:31,314 --> 01:50:33,452
But it's not a crime.

1049
01:50:34,902 --> 01:50:36,290
I'm not so sure.

1050
01:50:38,348 --> 01:50:40,106
Go back to work.

1051
01:50:41,301 --> 01:50:42,885
Change the world.

1052
01:51:02,979 --> 01:51:08,582
A gift, uh, you understand?
Let's say for Catholics everywhere.

1053
01:51:08,795 --> 01:51:11,455
The Carmelengo's age shouldn't reach
the decision.

1054
01:51:11,634 --> 01:51:17,204
Signori, you are no doubt aware
that the Holy Law of that man is
inelligible for election to the papacy.

1055
01:51:17,540 --> 01:51:20,797
He's not a cardinal. He's a priest.
He's of insufficient age.

1056
01:51:21,007 --> 01:51:23,878
Or maybe there's a way we
could consider the possibility.

1057
01:51:24,071 --> 01:51:28,039
I am sorry. The protocols of conclave
are not subject to modification.

1058
01:51:28,208 --> 01:51:31,026
I will not call a
ballot on this matter.

1059
01:51:31,232 --> 01:51:33,808
But, signore, you would not hold a ballot.

1060
01:51:34,011 --> 01:51:37,384
Surely, you remember? You gave
up your post as Great Elector.

1061
01:51:38,121 --> 01:51:40,264
They are singing at St. Peter's Square.

1062
01:51:40,452 --> 01:51:43,088
Now, what happened here tonight
transcends our laws.

1063
01:51:43,308 --> 01:51:48,044
Has it? Is it God's will that we
give ourselves over to frenzy?

1064
01:51:48,048 --> 01:51:49,479
Discard the rules of the Church?

1065
01:51:49,519 --> 01:51:51,719
Perhaps we need not discard them.

1066
01:51:52,345 --> 01:51:57,947
Signori, I am thinking now of
Romano Pontifici Eligendo numero 60...

1067
01:51:58,187 --> 01:52:01,081
Acclamation by Adoration.
- Exactly, signore. Exactly.

1068
01:52:01,350 --> 01:52:03,805
Yes. If the Holy Spirit speaks through us...

1069
01:52:04,326 --> 01:52:06,226
and we call a man's name out loud...

1070
01:52:06,420 --> 01:52:09,172
That is election by adoration.

1071
01:52:09,602 --> 01:52:11,429
He's God's choice.

1072
01:52:11,709 --> 01:52:17,448
Yes. And the candidate need only be an
ordained member of the clergy...

1073
01:52:17,452 --> 01:52:21,538
present in the Sistine Chapel
at the moment of his election.

1074
01:52:53,280 --> 01:52:54,325
Signor Camerlengo?

1075
01:52:55,258 --> 01:52:59,057
- Yes?
The cardinals ask you to join
them in conclave as soon as possible.

1076
01:52:59,142 --> 01:53:01,634
Me?
- Yes, Padre.

1077
01:53:24,425 --> 01:53:25,981
What are you doing?

1078
01:53:26,063 --> 01:53:28,542
Silvano's journals. I want them back.

1079
01:53:52,272 --> 01:53:53,745
Richter said...

1080
01:53:55,566 --> 01:53:57,900
His Holiness suffered from seizures...

1081
01:53:57,905 --> 01:54:00,412
and steps were taken...

1082
01:54:00,621 --> 01:54:02,519
for safety.

1083
01:54:06,524 --> 01:54:09,069
He made sure he was watched he said.

1084
01:54:11,152 --> 01:54:14,095
What if he were trying
to give me this key?

1085
01:54:15,259 --> 01:54:17,226
That's the Papal office.

1086
01:54:17,660 --> 01:54:22,486
If the Pope was worried about
seizures, he must've had Richter
install cameras without telling anyone.

1087
01:54:22,521 --> 01:54:25,323
To keep an eye on him for his safety.

1088
01:54:26,786 --> 01:54:28,761
Maybe it records.

1089
01:54:39,127 --> 01:54:43,772
I read the journals, Patrick.
- The scientist kept journals. So?

1090
01:54:43,773 --> 01:54:47,139
You figure prominently in them.
- Really?

1091
01:54:47,141 --> 01:54:51,741
The Devoli wasn't just a physicist.
He was also a Catholic priest.

1092
01:54:52,439 --> 01:54:58,626
As such, he was deeply conflicted
about the implications of his work
and in need of spiritual guidance.

1093
01:54:58,634 --> 01:55:00,398
Like Galileo.

1094
01:55:01,239 --> 01:55:03,045
About a month ago...

1095
01:55:03,049 --> 01:55:06,313
he requested an audience with the Pope.
But you know that.

1096
01:55:06,505 --> 01:55:09,786
You soon granted the audience and
you were also present during it.

1097
01:55:09,788 --> 01:55:12,966
The 'God Particle'.
To actually claim an act of creation.

1098
01:55:12,967 --> 01:55:17,354
The blasphemy. The arrogance.
- The Holy Father didn't see it like that.

1099
01:55:17,459 --> 01:55:19,559
He urged him to go public.

1100
01:55:19,564 --> 01:55:25,608
His Holiness thought that the discovery
could actually scientifically prove the
existence of a divine power.

1101
01:55:25,611 --> 01:55:28,814
And begin to bridge the gap between
science and religion.

1102
01:55:28,818 --> 01:55:31,420
His work was not religious.
It was sacrilegious.

1103
01:55:31,422 --> 01:55:32,234
But you...

1104
01:55:33,124 --> 01:55:36,864
You saw the pope's position as
a softening of church law.

1105
01:55:36,869 --> 01:55:40,684
As an old man's weakness.
Your father's weakness.

1106
01:55:40,719 --> 01:55:44,537
You murdered the Vicar of Christ.
- He raised me to protect this Church...

1107
01:55:44,540 --> 01:55:46,123
even from within.

1108
01:55:47,867 --> 01:55:52,450
Then you conjured up an old
enemy from the past. The Illuminati.

1109
01:55:52,485 --> 01:55:56,007
You found the ancient brands in
the papal vaults and put them to use...

1110
01:55:56,729 --> 01:55:59,992
to spread fear!
- The Cardinals are men of belief.

1111
01:56:00,029 --> 01:56:04,015
Right now, their belief in evil
is uniting them.

1112
01:56:04,020 --> 01:56:07,015
The entire Catholic world will
be united by this attack.

1113
01:56:07,020 --> 01:56:08,602
There is no attack.

1114
01:56:09,562 --> 01:56:12,788
You're trying to convince the
Cardinals they're in a war...

1115
01:56:12,793 --> 01:56:14,638
so they will choose a warrior
to lead them.

1116
01:56:14,642 --> 01:56:16,076
We are at war.

1117
01:56:16,078 --> 01:56:18,115
We're weak when we should be strong.

1118
01:56:18,119 --> 01:56:22,014
If science is allowed to claim
the power of creation...

1119
01:56:22,028 --> 01:56:23,786
what is left for God?

1120
01:56:23,821 --> 01:56:25,745
It didn't work, Patrick.

1121
01:56:26,633 --> 01:56:29,619
It isn't finished.
- Oh, yes, it's finished.

1122
01:56:31,691 --> 01:56:33,082
It's finished.

1123
01:56:33,940 --> 01:56:37,145
I've shown the journals to
Father Simeon.

1124
01:56:37,151 --> 01:56:39,331
The moment the doors
to the Conclave open...

1125
01:56:39,337 --> 01:56:41,492
he will tell the Cardinals
what you've done.

1126
01:56:42,381 --> 01:56:44,591
I was planning on doing this alone.

1127
01:56:47,866 --> 01:56:49,050
Put it down.

1128
01:56:52,065 --> 01:56:54,092
But, perhaps, it's better
that you're here.

1129
01:56:54,139 --> 01:56:55,520
Put it down.

1130
01:56:57,419 --> 01:56:59,156
Put it away.

1131
01:57:10,224 --> 01:57:13,820
Help. He's the one.
He's got a gun.

1132
01:57:17,464 --> 01:57:19,896
Illuminatus.
- You bastard.

1133
01:57:20,253 --> 01:57:21,015
Illuminatus!

1134
01:57:21,021 --> 01:57:22,167
You bastard!

1135
01:57:26,246 --> 01:57:27,353
Padre.

1136
01:57:37,255 --> 01:57:40,423
And get the helicopter for
the older cardinals, right?

1137
01:58:29,871 --> 01:58:32,414
I've been summoned
by the College of Cardinals.

1138
01:59:42,437 --> 01:59:43,756
Gently.

1139
01:59:44,064 --> 01:59:45,438
But within our walls.

1140
01:59:57,560 --> 02:00:00,023
He's on your side.

1141
02:00:46,353 --> 02:00:50,261
Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit.

1142
02:01:38,160 --> 02:01:46,800
Church sources now confirm that Carmelengo,
Father Patrick McKenna, has died of internal
injuries sustained in his heroic fall...

1143
02:01:48,120 --> 02:01:54,560
The Catholic church thanks Camerlengo
for his selfless act and demands his immediate canonization.

1144
02:01:54,640 --> 02:01:59,651
The Vatican has also confirmed the
deaths of three Cardinals and the fire
in the Santa Maria della Vittoria.

1145
02:01:59,746 --> 02:02:04,021
As we await the appearance of
the new Holy Father Cardinal
Baggia of Italy...

1146
02:02:04,150 --> 02:02:05,725
one of the four original Preferiti...

1147
02:02:06,233 --> 02:02:08,374
who, despite terrorist
attempts at disruption...

1148
02:02:08,414 --> 02:02:14,022
seems to have been selected in one of
the swiftest and smoothest conclaves
in modern church history.

1149
02:02:21,116 --> 02:02:22,869
Professor Langdon?
Please.

1150
02:02:38,603 --> 02:02:42,059
A token of thanks from
His Holiness...

1151
02:02:42,561 --> 02:02:44,799
and from his new Camerlengo.

1152
02:02:46,273 --> 02:02:49,028
We are grateful you saved his life.

1153
02:02:49,137 --> 02:02:52,665
And it's our understanding that you
require this text...

1154
02:02:52,670 --> 02:02:55,165
to complete your scholary work.

1155
02:02:56,397 --> 02:03:01,198
We ask only that in your
last grand testament...

1156
02:03:01,267 --> 02:03:04,061
you ensure it finds its way home.

1157
02:03:06,474 --> 02:03:07,823
Of course.

1158
02:03:08,041 --> 02:03:10,011
And when you write of us...

1159
02:03:10,134 --> 02:03:12,783
and you will write of us...

1160
02:03:13,032 --> 02:03:14,976
may I ask one thing?

1161
02:03:15,473 --> 02:03:17,196
Do so gently.

1162
02:03:18,948 --> 02:03:20,385
I'll try.

1163
02:03:20,981 --> 02:03:22,685
Religion is flawed...

1164
02:03:23,358 --> 02:03:26,263
but only because man is flawed.

1165
02:03:26,267 --> 02:03:28,881
All men,
including this one.

1166
02:03:43,425 --> 02:03:45,377
He chose the name Luke.

1167
02:03:47,987 --> 02:03:51,062
There's been many Marks and Johns.

1168
02:03:52,167 --> 02:03:54,043
Never a Luke.

1169
02:03:54,408 --> 02:03:56,537
It said he was a doctor.

1170
02:03:56,981 --> 02:04:00,501
It's quite a message.
Science and faith, all in one.

1171
02:04:01,406 --> 02:04:03,473
The world is in need of both.

1172
02:04:05,183 --> 02:04:07,326
You'll counsel him wisely.

1173
02:04:08,181 --> 02:04:10,974
I'm an old man.
I'll counsel him briefly.

1174
02:04:16,800 --> 02:04:18,666
Mr. Langdon.

1175
02:04:23,689 --> 02:04:28,410
Thanks be to God for sending someone
to protect this church.

1176
02:04:32,341 --> 02:04:35,683
I don't believe He sent me, Father.

1177
02:04:35,744 --> 02:04:37,304
Oh, my son.

1178
02:04:37,766 --> 02:04:39,685
Of course He did.
