Are you aware of that, Michaels?

67
00:09:05,907 --> 00:09:07,836
是的 我不像你
- I guess so, yeah. - I wasn't.

68
00:09:07,837 --> 00:09:08,788
我是你這么大的時候  我就可以處理殺人案件了
When I was your age, I was happy with regular murder and mayhem.

69
00:09:08,789 --> 00:09:11,291

不管怎么樣 他們叫我畢卡索警長
Anyway, the Chief starts calling me Lieutenant Picasso...

72
00:09:15,254 --> 00:09:18,298

73
00:09:18,299 --> 00:09:21,504
和盡可能多的犯罪案件
of as much as an Etch-A-Sketch.

I wouldn't take less than 100.

81
00:10:13,813 --> 00:10:15,613
我只是說說而已
I'm just saying, is all.

82
00:10:15,707 --> 00:10:17,212
你...
You... 

83
00:10:17,441 --> 00:10:18,741
你不介意我借用一下吧
Mind if I borrow this?

84
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:21,944
- 我也許想用一下它 - 嗯

把我的槍放下
Will you please put down my gun?

87
00:10:27,118 --> 00:10:30,245
加布里 有件情你應該注意一下了
There's one thing you should be aware of, Gabriel

88
00:10:30,246 --> 00:10:32,431
你喜歡自己還是馬丁
or do you prefer yourself or Martin?

89
00:10:32,832 --> 00:10:35,667
警察是不會因為你帶槍而逮捕你的
The police cannot arrest you for armed robbery

90
00:10:35,668 --> 00:10:37,252
如果你的槍沒上膛的話
if your gun isn't loaded.

91
00:10:37,253 --> 00:10:38,363
你的意思是...
Your point?

92
00:10:38,546 --> 00:10:41,423
你以為我會帶上一把上好膛的槍出來走嗎
You think I'd walk around with a loaded shotgun?

93
00:10:41,424 --> 00:10:43,624
我們試試吧 （扣槍聲）
- Let's see. - (Gun clicks)

94
00:10:45,845 --> 00:10:47,554
你早就應該試一下的 為什么

95
00:10:47,555 --> 00:10:50,850
你已經擁有了我的鉆石 我的槍 我的錢
You have my diamonds, my score, my money.

96
00:10:51,267 --> 00:10:54,337

Enjoy. Nice meeting you both. Bye.

97
00:10:54,937 --> 00:10:58,032
隨便說一下 我準備開口要125
By the way, I was going to ask for 125.

98
00:10:59,316 --> 00:11:00,976
我只是說說
I'm just saying, is all.

99
00:11:02,278 --> 00:11:04,168
站住 加布里  為什么
- Gabriel, stay. - Why?

100
00:11:04,488 --> 00:11:07,553
你還想要什么 先殺了我
What else do you want? You gonna shoot me now?

101
00:11:08,117 --> 00:11:10,452
鑒于鉆石是你偷來的
Well, in as much as you did steal the diamonds

102
00:11:10,453 --> 00:11:14,164
我想只有讓你一份 分享成果才算公平嘛
I figure it's only fair to share the proceeds with you.

103
00:11:14,165 --> 00:11:17,490
那我是應該感謝你的慷慨和大方了
So to what do I owe this act of generosity?

104
00:11:18,544 --> 00:11:21,664
我有一個事情要跟你討論
I have a proposition I wish to discuss with you.

105
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:26,400
那么...
So...

106
00:11:27,344 --> 00:11:29,637
你怎么知道我會來

107
00:11:29,638 --> 00:11:31,139
又怎么知道我的名字
as well as my name?

108
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:31,606
這只是事情的一部分
It's part of the proposition...

109
00:11:35,269 --> 00:11:36,149
哦 該死
Oh, shit!

問他 真他媽的謝謝你

114
00:11:49,033 --> 00:11:52,688
這是你跟他們的事 與我無關
This is between you and them. Got nothing to do with me.

115
00:11:53,162 --> 00:11:54,742
現在一切都清楚了
Everything does now.

116
00:11:57,374 --> 00:12:00,668
你應該感到高興 尼基等你都不耐煩了
Call this interest. Nicky is tired of waiting for you.

117
00:12:00,669 --> 00:12:01,206

(Speaks Russian)

118
00:12:11,597 --> 00:12:13,572
你會得到報應的
You must have very bad karma.

119
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:17,227
我一點都不相信佛家這套 還是說我們那個事情吧
I actually don't believe in it. Still, about this propos...

120
00:12:17,228 --> 00:12:20,203
不不不不 你瘋了

125
00:12:40,418 --> 00:12:42,308
現在你拿到的是我的那份
Now you've got mine.

126
00:12:44,004 --> 00:12:44,889
隨你怎么說
Whatever.

127
00:12:45,381 --> 00:12:47,771
考慮考慮吧 好的

一個拍檔
A partner.

131
00:13:27,131 --> 00:13:29,841
你覺得我在火車上干什么
What'd you think I was doing on that train?

132
00:13:29,842 --> 00:13:31,972
我一直在看著你
- I was watching you work. - Hm.

133
00:13:32,762 --> 00:13:36,139
從你一出現 我就開始關注著你
I've been your shadow ever since you got to town.

134
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:39,295
為什么你在我的小鎮地鐵里搶劫
So why were you in my town robbing subways?

135
00:13:41,228 --> 00:13:43,306
邁阿密正是颶風盛行 我不喜歡
It's hurricane season in Miami. I don't like hurricanes.

136
00:13:43,307 --> 00:13:46,814
還是你不喜歡回到安哥拉
Or you didn't feel like going back to Angola.

137
00:13:48,407 --> 00:13:49,117

Gabriel Martin is a rock star.

141
00:13:55,242 --> 00:13:58,652
為什么你那天晚上在地鐵拿著槍公開搶劫
So why were you holding open-mike night on the subway...

142
00:13:58,663 --> 00:14:01,953
弄他個1O幾萬什么的
for a lousy 100 grand?

143
00:14:02,074 --> 00:14:03,141
兩個理由
Two reasons...

144
00:14:03,142 --> 00:14:06,212
是的 邁阿密變得越來越熱了
Yes, Miami was getting too hot.

145
00:14:06,337 --> 00:14:07,927
也許這與你有關
And perhaps you can relate to this.

146
00:14:08,672 --> 00:14:09,732
有時候是這樣
Sometimes...

147
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:14,672
有時候你得感到緊迫點
Sometimes you just need to feel the rush.

148
00:14:17,181 --> 00:14:18,681
來杯果汁
The juice.

149
00:14:19,308 --> 00:14:19,773
好
Yeah.

150
00:14:20,893 --> 00:14:22,538
你明白我的意思
You know what I mean.

151
00:14:23,312 --> 00:14:25,522
昨天 你拿下了兩個珠寶
Yesterday, you took down two jewelers...

152
00:14:25,523 --> 00:14:27,513
從羅曼那里
for a few stones from Romanov's.

153
00:14:28,943 --> 00:14:30,953
我就只是要羅曼的
My idea is Romanov's itself.

154
00:14:31,737 --> 00:14:32,777
請
(Sniggers) Please...

155
00:14:34,198 --> 00:14:38,108
具體來說 藝術品法貝格彩蛋值2000萬美元
Specifically, two Faberg eggs worth 20 million dollars...

156
00:14:39,746 --> 00:14:40,906
每個人
Each.

157
00:14:43,290 --> 00:14:44,985
這需要兩個人合作
It's a two-man job.

158
00:14:47,002 --> 00:14:48,717
夠吸引人的吧
Do I have your attention?

159
00:15:11,277 --> 00:15:12,247
在這里等著
Wait here.

160
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:17,785
我聽說他們喜歡現金 還有你的初次表現
I hear they prefer cash... or your first-born.

161
00:15:42,475 --> 00:15:45,070
為什么不看看這個
Why don't you try The Standard instead?

162
00:15:48,856 --> 00:15:49,566
嫉妒？
Jealous?

163
00:15:50,983 --> 00:15:51,778
嫉妒誰啊
Of who?

164
00:15:53,986 --> 00:15:55,251
神秘大盜
The mystery bandit.

165
00:15:55,821 --> 00:15:58,921
我想我不是那種類型的人
I'm afraid that type of thing is not my style.

166
00:15:59,325 --> 00:16:02,845
哦 我認為你這個人還挺威風挺有膽量的
Well, I think this guy's got panache... guts.

167
00:16:05,289 --> 00:16:08,506
跟那個穿過地鐵的人樣子很像 至少體型很像
And a passing resemblance, at least in body type.

168
00:16:10,503 --> 00:16:13,922
你不一定要通過搶劫地鐵來表現威風
Well, you don't have to rob trains to have panache.

169
00:16:13,923 --> 00:16:18,406
或者膽量 但是你得承認那種事情能讓你馬上被人記住
Or guts... but you've gotta admit that kind of thing immediately brands you.

170
00:16:19,407 --> 00:16:20,117
俄語
(Speaks Russian)

171
00:16:23,099 --> 00:16:26,935
我請客 老是看到你讀斯拉夫報紙
My treat... too painful watching you attempt to read Cyrillic.

172
00:16:26,936 --> 00:16:29,896
不不不不 我只是 啊 看看圖片
Oh, no, no, no... I was just... huh, looking at the picture.

173
00:16:29,897 --> 00:16:31,562
所以你就是在嫉妒了
So you are jealous.

174
00:16:33,359 --> 00:16:36,009
是的 被你看出來了 真的
Yes... you got me there. Absolutely.

175
00:16:38,823 --> 00:16:41,866
我得去那里了 給我老板帶中國菜
I've gotta get this... Chinese food to my boss...

176
00:16:41,867 --> 00:16:42,677
哦 嗯
so, um...

177
00:16:44,036 --> 00:16:45,056
回見
some other time.

178
00:16:46,205 --> 00:16:48,978
什么時候 我打你的電話？
- When, some other time? - I'll call you.

179
00:16:48,999 --> 00:16:51,543
但是你沒有我的電話號碼 不知道我的名字和別的
But you don't have my number or know my name or anything.

180
00:16:51,544 --> 00:16:53,344
我覺得那不會是個問題
I guess that could be a problem.

181
00:16:53,045 --> 00:16:53,850
Ripley
(Ripley)

182
00:16:54,545 --> 00:16:55,350
加布里
Gabriel.

183
00:16:56,173 --> 00:16:58,341
哦 該死 你跟他一起的嗎
- Oh, shit! - Are you with him?

184
00:16:58,342 --> 00:17:00,135
我不知道 我應該那樣嗎 還是
I don't know. Should I? More or less.

185
00:17:00,136 --> 00:17:02,401
啊 是的 我跟他一起的
Ahh... yes, I am.

186
00:17:02,721 --> 00:17:04,001
你想要什么
What'd you want?

187
00:17:05,474 --> 00:17:08,017
我就不能給我的教女買個生日禮物嗎
Can't I bring my goddaughter a birthday present?

188
00:17:08,018 --> 00:17:09,561
我的生日是上個月
My birthday was last month.

189
00:17:09,562 --> 00:17:12,613
兩個星期前 對不起我送晚了
It was two weeks ago and I'm sorry it's late.

190
00:17:12,614 --> 00:17:15,414
阿歷克斯 只是一份禮物 沒什么的
Alex, it's just a present. No strings.

191
00:17:17,737 --> 00:17:18,862
不需要了 謝謝
No thanks.

192
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:23,908
哦 很高興遇到了你 加布里
Well, it was nice to have almost met you, Gabriel.

193
00:17:23,909 --> 00:17:25,069
加比 加比
- Gaby. - Gaby.

194
00:17:26,537 --> 00:17:30,222
真是遺憾啊 老是被人控制著
It's a shame you don't keep a higher class of company.

195
00:17:35,504 --> 00:17:39,329
別在意她   那該在意什么呢
- Don't even think about it. - Think about what?

196
00:17:39,550 --> 00:17:42,886
你給我離她遠點 要不然我會要了你的命的 我是說真的
You go anywhere near her. I'll rip your heart out. I mean it.

197
00:17:42,887 --> 00:17:46,732
會要了你的命吧 她好像不怎么喜歡你
It looks like it's your heart, she's not so fond of.

198
00:17:47,725 --> 00:17:49,820
我警告過你了啊 走吧
You were warned. Let's go.

199
00:17:50,269 --> 00:17:52,479
我記得你說過目標是羅曼家
(Gabriel) I thought you said the target was Romanov's.

200
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,790
- 這只是一個調查    - 一個調查?
- This is research.    - Research?

201
00:17:55,608 --> 00:17:56,453
哦, 哇哦!
Oh, wow!

202
00:18:02,448 --> 00:18:04,218
他們太顯眼了
They're absolutely stunning.

203
00:18:07,495 --> 00:18:08,725
太顯眼了
(Ripley) They are.

204
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:11,350
在1885年到1916年
Between 1885 and 1916...

205
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:16,086
法貝格為女皇制作了50顆復活節彩蛋
Faberg produced 50 of these Easter eggs for the Empress...

206
00:18:16,087 --> 00:18:17,906
她的皇家兒媳 卓愛麗娜 阿歷克桑德拉
and her daughter-in-law, the Czarina Alexandra.

207
00:18:18,339 --> 00:18:19,214
我要記下來嗎?
Should I take notes?

208
00:18:20,283 --> 00:18:22,250
要作小測試的嗎?
Will there be a quiz?

209
00:18:22,551 --> 00:18:24,656
沒有測試 但會是一個考驗
No quiz but there will be a test.

210
00:18:25,221 --> 00:18:29,751
好 這些彩蛋都是用貴重金屬和珠寶做成的
Okay... the Faberg are all made of precious metals and fine jewels.

211
00:18:31,143 --> 00:18:34,443
- 每一件都是實際上獨一無二的珍品  - 的確
- Every one a unique masterpiece.  - Indeed.

212
00:18:35,147 --> 00:18:37,607
大部分都陳列在克里姆林宮
Most are on display in the Kremlin.

213
00:18:37,608 --> 00:18:41,236
其他的被收藏家或者收藏館收藏了 或者遺失了
The rest in private collections, museums... or lost.

214
00:18:41,237 --> 00:18:43,767
這樣的情青況下 只有羅曼家有了
In this case, at Romanov's.

215
00:18:44,532 --> 00:18:45,952
誰是你的買家
Who is your buyer?

216
00:18:46,784 --> 00:18:48,549
你不會想知道的
You don't want to know.

217
00:18:48,577 --> 00:18:52,038
哦 我要偷價值4000萬美元的彩蛋 當然要知道買家是誰了
Oh, I'm stealing 40 million dollars worth of eggs so I want to know.

218
00:18:52,039 --> 00:18:54,749
我也想知道為什么這些奇特的彩蛋
I also want to know why these particular eggs...

219
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:56,970
可以值4000萬美金
are even worth 40 million dollars.

220
00:18:57,586 --> 00:19:00,016
因為沒有人知道它們在哪里
Because no one knows they exist.

221
00:19:00,714 --> 00:19:01,306
哦 
Oh.

222
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:04,237
- 所以就叫做神秘的蛋  - 嗯
- The so-called mystery eggs?  - Mm-hm.

223
00:19:04,926 --> 00:19:08,263
是的 我當時也聽說了很多謠言 想那只是個神話罷了
Yeah, I've heard rumours, but I thought it was just a myth.

224
00:19:08,764 --> 00:19:13,140
去年 彩蛋現身了    在羅曼家
Last year, they turned up...    at Romanov's.

225
00:19:13,644 --> 00:19:14,944
你是怎么知道的
So how do you know this?

226
00:19:15,104 --> 00:19:20,150
我當時和一個叫維克多 克羅勒克的拍檔一起 就是阿歷克斯的父親
I was partners with a man named Victor Korolenko... Alex's father.

227
00:19:20,151 --> 00:19:22,110
他和俄方有緊密的聯系
He was in tight with the Russians.

228
00:19:22,111 --> 00:19:24,886
俄方知道的 他也知道
What they knew, he knew.

229
00:19:25,072 --> 00:19:27,991
那為什么你不跟他合作這件事呢
So, why aren't you pulling this job with him?

230
00:19:27,992 --> 00:19:30,827
現在他不在了
Let's just say he's no longer around.

231
00:19:31,553 --> 00:19:33,398
不說他了
Leave it at that.

232
00:19:37,668 --> 00:19:38,618
他都走了
He's gone.

233
00:19:39,336 --> 00:19:40,496
而剛好你來了
You're here.

234
00:19:42,673 --> 00:19:44,908
現在 我們要分頭行動了
Now we just have to deliver.

235
00:19:46,719 --> 00:19:48,019
Ripley  嗯
- Ripley... - Hmm?

236
00:19:49,346 --> 00:19:49,916
為什么
Why?

237
00:19:52,016 --> 00:19:54,481
為什么要把你自己的自由做賭注
Why risk your freedom at all?

238
00:19:54,810 --> 00:19:57,020
你令人難以理解
This will not be anything close to easy.

239
00:19:57,021 --> 00:19:59,147
現在你又不在監獄里
You are not in jail in the present.

240
00:19:59,148 --> 00:20:02,568
你不舒服嗎   我從來沒有舒服過
- Are you not comfortable? - I'm never comfortable.

241
00:20:03,402 --> 00:20:05,987
有些人天生就會做音樂
Some people were born to compose music.

242
00:20:07,782 --> 00:20:09,637
有些人會分離原子
Others to split the atom.

243
00:20:12,411 --> 00:20:14,456
而我是生來就會偷東西
I was born to steal shit.

244
00:20:17,333 --> 00:20:18,788
伸出你的手來
Hold out your hand.

245
00:20:20,711 --> 00:00:02,000
手？
Hand?

246
00:20:26,801 --> 00:20:30,887
我和維克多做拍檔時他送了這枚硬幣給我
That coin was given to me by Victor when we became partners.

247
00:20:30,888 --> 00:20:33,353
它在俄語中是有含義的
The coin represents a Russian phrase.

248
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:38,694
翻譯過來就是, 賊的世界
"Vorovoslky mlr". Loosely translated, thieves' world.

249
00:20:39,605 --> 00:20:41,147
維克多屬于它
Victor belonged to it.

250
00:20:41,148 --> 00:20:42,018
現在
Now...

251
00:20:43,567 --> 00:20:44,812
你屬于它
you belong to it.

252
00:21:24,525 --> 00:21:25,285
嘿
Psst... Hey!

253
00:21:26,485 --> 00:21:30,010
你誤會了   Ripley 跟我只是生意關系
You misunderstand.   Ripley's just... huh, business.

254
00:21:30,406 --> 00:21:31,686
這個是 嗯
This is... huh...

255
00:21:32,450 --> 00:21:33,335
潛行追蹤？
Stalking?

256
00:21:35,494 --> 00:21:39,748
呃 如果你早就給我號碼的話 我就會先打給你了
Well... if you had given me your number, I would have called first.

257
00:21:39,749 --> 00:21:42,089
太蹩腳的猜想了
Those are two very flawed assumptions.

258
00:21:42,877 --> 00:21:44,362
你有花瓶嗎
Do you have a vase?

259
00:21:44,628 --> 00:21:46,713
我從路邊的圣壇采的
I just took these from a roadside shrine...

260
00:21:46,714 --> 00:21:49,349
我想它們需要一點水
and I think they need some, huh... water.

261
00:21:50,217 --> 00:21:50,717
啊
Huh...

262
00:21:51,802 --> 00:21:55,077
我可以用那個嗎？ 可以
- May I use that... huh, thing over there? - Sure...

263
00:21:57,057 --> 00:22:01,406
我發現了一個  俄羅斯夜總會   就在下面的那個街區
I... I've noticed this... huh, Russian nightclub, down the block, huh...

264
00:22:01,407 --> 00:22:04,362
好像叫 Riga Rose
Riga Rose or something like that.

265
00:22:04,363 --> 00:22:06,858
何不下班后到那里聚聚
Why don't we meet there after work?

266
00:22:12,239 --> 00:22:13,084
我很忙
I'm busy.

267
00:22:14,617 --> 00:22:16,832
我等你   我不會去的
- I'll wait. - I won't show.

268
00:22:18,162 --> 00:22:19,807
我還是會等你的
I'll take my chances.

269
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:26,070
再見 阿歷克桑德拉
Do svldanja, Alexandra.

270
00:22:27,213 --> 00:22:31,098
調查  Keith  Ripley  93年 布魯克林博物館
Research. Keith Ripley. '93, the Brooklyn Museum.

271
00:22:31,842 --> 00:22:34,928
94年 鉆石區倉庫 95年...
'94, the Diamond District Warehouse and then in '95...

272
00:22:34,929 --> 00:22:38,556
麥克 我太熟悉 Ripley 的生平事跡了
I'm very familiar with Ripley's life story, Michaels.

273
00:22:38,557 --> 00:22:40,722
事實上 我抓過他兩次
In fact, I busted him twice.

274
00:22:42,103 --> 00:22:43,206
因為律師辯護得力  兩次都讓他逃了
Both times he walked because of good lawyering.

275
00:22:43,207 --> 00:22:44,813
的確  我想何不改變策略
Exactly, so I thought why not swing for the fences?

276
00:22:44,814 --> 00:22:47,554
一個殺人案  死者 維克多
Murder one, Victor Korolenko.

277
00:22:47,942 --> 00:22:49,984
想想   布萊特海岸蒸汽浴室   忘記它吧   那里沒有
Thinkin ' of the Brighton Beach steam bath? Forget it. There was no...

278
00:22:49,985 --> 00:22:53,071
沒有尸體     但是我們可用法醫驗證     沒有目擊者
- No body. But we've got a ton of forensics. - And no witnesses.

279
00:22:53,072 --> 00:22:55,552
沒有人敢出來作證
Nobody there admitted to seeing a thing.

280
00:22:58,452 --> 00:23:00,995
我差點能說服 維克多 接受證人保護
I was this close to convincing Korolenko to take witness protection,

281
00:23:00,996 --> 00:23:03,176
來指控 Ripley
in exchange for giving up Ripley.

282
00:23:03,416 --> 00:23:05,736
但是 Ripley 先行了一步
But Ripley got to him first.

283
00:23:06,168 --> 00:23:07,863
我又一次功虧一簣了
I can't prove it.

284
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:10,290
對 好吧 我明白了
Right, okay. I see, I see... okay.

285
00:23:10,297 --> 00:23:12,687
不 麥克
No... what you don't see, Michaels,

286
00:23:13,467 --> 00:23:16,594
你不明白的是為什么 Ripley 會卷入犯罪里
is why Ripley got involved in a small-time caper,

287
00:23:16,595 --> 00:23:20,056
比如在地鐵里搶劫鉆石還能逃走
like grabbin ' a few diamonds off of some couriers on a subway.

288
00:23:20,057 --> 00:23:21,224
我也不明白
And neither did I.

289
00:23:21,225 --> 00:23:24,070
直到我聽了一個荷蘭人的陳述
Until I read the Dutch guy's statement.

290
00:23:25,855 --> 00:23:28,250
這些鉆石來自于羅曼家
Those diamonds came from Romanov's.

291
00:23:29,483 --> 00:23:33,737
你的意思是 Ripley 和他的新搭檔計劃對羅曼家動手
You mean Ripley and his new partner are planning to take down Romanov's?

292
00:23:33,738 --> 00:23:36,656
呃 來 像那樣的事情是不會發生的
Ah... come on. Like that could ever happen.

293
00:23:36,657 --> 00:23:39,917
他還不只會對羅曼家下手呢
Not even Ripley could take down a place like that.

294
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,230
要不我們打個賭
Wanna bet?

295
00:24:08,707 --> 00:24:09,242
- Hi. - Hi.

296
00:24:11,025 --> 00:24:14,736
你對這個地方很熟   我沒有這樣說
- You know this place very well. - I never said I didn't.

297
00:24:14,737 --> 00:24:17,113
還是說實話吧 你本不知道這家夜總會的
Let's face it, you didn't see the nightclub.

298
00:24:17,114 --> 00:24:21,076
你看到了我傳真機上的扉頁 然后就順嘴說了
You saw the flyer in the fax and then you made an assumption.

299
00:24:21,077 --> 00:24:24,312
是的 罪過 我確實是這么干的
Yeah. Guilty. So I did.

300
00:24:24,455 --> 00:24:28,600
沒有想過要編造什么 特別是來這里
Never assume anything, especially down here.

301
00:24:28,709 --> 00:24:30,444
真神秘  
- How mysterious. 

302
00:24:30,662 --> 00:24:32,832
- 什么？    - 真神秘
- What?     - How mysterious.

303
00:24:33,547 --> 00:24:36,007
我可以請你喝一杯嗎  我不喝酒的
- Can I buy you a drink? - I don't drink.

304
00:24:36,008 --> 00:24:38,263
那你來干什么
Another assumption.

305
00:24:40,471 --> 00:24:41,561
跳舞嗎
You wanna dance?

306
00:24:45,768 --> 00:24:46,303
好吧
Yeah.

307
00:24:47,686 --> 00:24:51,541
我不怕出洋相 為什么不跳呢
I'm willing to make a fool of myself. Why not?

308
00:25:47,329 --> 00:25:49,064
（俄語）這兒
(Alex speaks Russian) Here.

309
00:25:51,292 --> 00:25:53,022
給他 謝謝
- And for him. - Thank you.

310
00:25:53,043 --> 00:25:53,648
謝謝
Thanks.

311
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:56,212
我以為每個俄國人都喝酒的呢
I thought all Russians drank.

312
00:25:56,213 --> 00:25:59,716
酒，翻譯過來是 喝了以后容易犯事的飲料
Translation, we're a race of suicidal alcoholics.

313
00:25:59,717 --> 00:26:02,122
不 我不是那個意思 不是
No... I didn't mean that. No.

314
00:26:02,261 --> 00:26:04,986
實際上 事實是這樣的 干杯
Actually, we are. Cheers.

315
00:26:05,806 --> 00:26:07,951
干杯 干杯
- Nastravila? - Nastravise

316
00:26:08,267 --> 00:26:09,506
干杯 嗯
Nastravise? Mm'mm

317
00:26:10,853 --> 00:26:15,593
為律師做事是怎么樣的
So... how is it... working for the lawyer?

318
00:26:16,150 --> 00:26:19,420
嗯 我就是一個律師
- Huh... I'm a lawyer, too, you know. - Oh.

319
00:26:20,112 --> 00:26:23,698
也許我不會說話了 因為我說的都是錯的
Maybe I won't say another word, because everthing I say is wrong.

320
00:26:23,699 --> 00:26:26,910
你不試試 你怎能知道  那倒是
- Well, you don't know until you try. - True.

321
00:26:26,911 --> 00:26:29,829
還有 我父親不讓我做律師
Besides, my father warned me about being a lawyer.

322
00:26:29,830 --> 00:26:33,208
他要我嘗試 要對自己的一生保持忠誠
He told me I should try and do something honest with my life.

323
00:26:33,209 --> 00:26:34,959
假如他還能知道的話
As if he would know.

324
00:26:35,711 --> 00:26:40,836
你父親和 Ripley 很親密對吧
Your father and Ripley, they were close, right?

325
00:26:42,426 --> 00:26:43,601
以前是
Once upon a time.

326
00:26:47,473 --> 00:26:50,798
Ripley 告訴過你吧 我父親過世了
I'm sure Ripley told you. My father's dead.

327
00:26:51,602 --> 00:26:55,277
現在 Ripley 要照顧我
Now Ripley likes to try to take care of me.

328
00:26:55,481 --> 00:26:57,786
還債  之類的事青
Pay for stuff. That kind of thing.

329
00:26:57,983 --> 00:27:00,698
當然 他至少可以這樣做
Of course, it's the least he can do.

330
00:27:01,695 --> 00:27:05,815
對不起 我不是要打探什么
Sorry. I don't mean to pry.

331
00:27:10,913 --> 00:27:11,706
可是 你確實是在打探啊
Yes, you do.

332
00:27:15,376 --> 00:27:17,266
這是你的想法
Now who is making assumptions?

333
00:27:19,046 --> 00:27:23,141
不 加比 我沒有想什么
No, Gaby. I'm not assuming a thing.

334
00:27:39,233 --> 00:27:41,963
你想了解 Ripley ?
You wanna know about Ripley?

335
00:27:43,738 --> 00:27:44,638
離他遠點
Stay away.

336
00:28:24,570 --> 00:28:26,795
混蛋
You son of a bitch!

337
00:28:29,033 --> 00:28:30,888
哦 你忘了這個
Well... you dropped these...

338
00:28:31,077 --> 00:28:35,162
我好心把它給你送回來了
and I am a gentleman bringing them back to you.

339
00:28:35,456 --> 00:28:36,196
噢 噢
Uh-huh.

340
00:28:42,129 --> 00:28:43,904
不 不 不 不 不
No, no, no, no, no!

341
00:28:46,383 --> 00:28:46,778
不
No!

342
00:29:37,685 --> 00:29:40,075
該死的 大哥 你想干什么呀
Shit, man! What do you want?

343
00:29:41,731 --> 00:29:44,071
我告訴過你讓你離她遠點
I told you to leave her alone.

344
00:29:44,608 --> 00:29:46,843
我下次不會再警告你了
I'm not gonna tell you again.

345
00:29:47,403 --> 00:29:49,638
穿好衣服 我先下樓
Get dressed. I'll be downstairs.

346
00:29:58,914 --> 00:29:59,949
混蛋
Son of a bitch.

347
00:30:04,795 --> 00:30:05,645
太棒了
Fascinating.

348
00:30:08,215 --> 00:30:12,255
在設計完成以前 你可以開始你的準備工作了
You could start a whole new trend in interior design.

349
00:30:14,346 --> 00:30:17,098
這些是什么  看起來像什么？
- What are these? - What do they look like?

350
00:30:17,099 --> 00:30:18,034
警察證？
Police IDs?

351
00:30:19,310 --> 00:30:23,440
今晚在羅曼家有一個招待會 為NYPD辦的
There's a reception at Romanov's tonight, honouring the NYPD.

352
00:30:24,065 --> 00:30:26,495
我們的邀請函也剛收到了
And our invitation's just arrived.

353
00:30:27,068 --> 00:30:28,485
今晚我們要扮警察
A cop for the night.

354
00:30:28,486 --> 00:30:30,806
還可以吃到炸面圈
And all the doughnuts you can eat.

355
00:30:30,988 --> 00:30:34,157
期間 我要你進入到干洗店去
Meanwhile, however, Ineed you to go to the dry-cleaners.

356
00:30:34,158 --> 00:30:37,952
先生 為什么你自己不去取你干洗好的衣服呢
Why don't you go and pick up your dry-cleaning yourself, sir?

357
00:30:37,953 --> 00:30:40,308
誰說的要去“取”
Who said anything about picking up?

358
00:30:41,415 --> 00:30:42,905
你自己掉下的
You're dropping off.

359
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:52,445
越南語
(Speaks Vietnamese)

360
00:30:57,681 --> 00:30:58,826
越南語
(Speaks Vietnamese)

361
00:31:22,790 --> 00:31:23,830
手機
Cellphone, please.

362
00:31:48,858 --> 00:31:51,108
好了，瑟吉夫，正如美國人所說的

363
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:52,950
我們有網路要做

364
00:31:54,572 --> 00:31:56,672
你好 長官 先生
- Commissioner Rawls. - Gentlemen.

365
00:31:56,699 --> 00:31:58,504
副長官 莫雷利
Deputy Commissioner Morelli.

366
00:31:58,826 --> 00:32:00,836
很高興見到你
Such a pleasure having you here.

367
00:32:00,870 --> 00:32:03,365
我帶你參觀參觀
May we give you gentlemen the grand tour?

368
00:32:03,622 --> 00:32:05,999
羅曼的秘密 可以這么說
- The secrets of Romanov? - You might say so.

369
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,425
謝謝 榮幸之極 請
- Thank you. We're honored. - Please.

370
00:32:13,424 --> 00:32:16,269
這些警衛 都是FBI的警察
(Ripley) The guards, all FSB secret police.

371
00:32:16,302 --> 00:32:19,888
每道門 每塊玻璃和線路都有報警裝置
Every door, every inch of glass wired and alarmed.

372
00:32:19,889 --> 00:32:23,914
所以一只鳥也飛不進來的
So even if a bird flies in here, you know about it.

373
00:32:24,369 --> 00:32:26,106
Topkapi. 

374
00:32:26,107 --> 00:32:27,752
Rififi.

375
00:32:27,807 --> 00:32:31,238
不 鳥可以飛到博物館還可以挺在電線上
No, the bird flew into the museum, landed on the wire...

376
00:32:31,239 --> 00:32:33,614
線路已經鋪好了 那是在電影通天大盜里
and set off the alarm in Topkapi.

377
00:32:34,052 --> 00:32:35,306
你是一個電影愛好者
You're a cineaste.

378
00:32:35,307 --> 00:32:38,740
實際上 我只看搶劫盜竊這一類的片子
Actually, I only see heist movies.

379
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:43,084
從一只鳥 飛到博物館然后又逃出來得到的經驗
Well, the lesson to take away from the bird flying into the museum...

380
00:32:43,085 --> 00:32:47,940
就是無論你如何規劃 總是要臨時發揮的
is no matter how well you planned, always be ready to improvise...

381
00:32:47,948 --> 00:32:51,501
因為 我向你保證 事情有時要出錯的
because, I guarantee you, something's gonna go wrong.

382
00:32:51,502 --> 00:32:53,572
我盡量避免 嗯
- I'd prefer to avoid that. - Uh-huh.

383
00:32:53,621 --> 00:32:56,596
監視系統有多精密？
How comprehensive is the surveillance system?

384
00:32:57,217 --> 00:32:58,947
讓我看看
Let's take a look.

385
00:33:02,689 --> 00:33:03,129
俄語

386
00:33:16,007 --> 00:33:18,617
(Speaks Russian)

387
00:33:19,907 --> 00:33:22,859
- 每個電梯都要通行卡   - 每道門也是一樣
- Smart card for the elevator.   - And all the doors.

388
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:24,165
這邊 你走先
This way. After you.

389
00:33:24,954 --> 00:33:26,569
我們走吧
We're on.

390
00:33:29,166 --> 00:33:32,441
見到你真好 讓我介紹一下
Good to see you, old friend. Let me introduce you.

391
00:33:33,254 --> 00:33:36,569
韋伯警長 恕我冒昧啊
Lieutenant Weber, I presume.

392
00:33:37,758 --> 00:33:41,636
你要知道 Ripley  假冒警察可是嚴重的犯罪
You know, Ripley, identity theft is a serious crime.

393
00:33:41,637 --> 00:33:44,722
- 是相當令人難堪的事情   -真的？
- And quite an embarrassing one in this case.   - Really?

394
00:33:44,723 --> 00:33:46,599
你意識到有多羞恥嗎
Do you realise how ashamed I felt...

395
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:50,395
告訴門口那些可愛的女士們我是假冒的警察
telling that nice lady at the door that I was still a lieutenant?

396
00:33:50,396 --> 00:33:52,321
我的意思是說以我這樣的年紀
I mean at my age?

397
00:33:52,523 --> 00:33:53,806
或者說以你這樣的年紀
Or should I say at your age?

398
00:33:53,807 --> 00:33:54,957
我不是開玩笑 
I'm not amused. 

399
00:33:55,858 --> 00:33:56,603
你在這里干什么?
What are you doing here? 

400
00:33:56,807 --> 00:33:59,277
你被邀請?
And why did you appropriate my invitation? 

401
00:33:59,278 --> 00:34:00,533
我好像一無所知
As if I didn't know.

402
00:34:00,948 --> 00:34:03,013
我為我的托辭道歉
I apologise for the subterfuge.

403
00:34:03,242 --> 00:34:06,453
我只是想帶我的朋友來看看 這有什么好東西
I just wanted to show my friend here some of the finer things in life.

404
00:34:06,454 --> 00:34:10,749
如果你因為我們假扮警察要逮捕我們 那就請便吧
If you want to arrest us for impersonating police officers, go right ahead.

405
00:34:10,750 --> 00:34:13,293
我可以保證我的律師會在兩個小時候替我們開脫的
I'm sure my lawyer will have us out in two hours.

406
00:34:13,294 --> 00:34:16,796
那將會是令人愉快的兩個小時 把你的手放下來
It'd be a delightful two hours. Get your hands down.

407
00:34:16,797 --> 00:34:20,550
那就不知道你該怎么向你的上司解釋了
Then there's all that explaining you'd have to do to your superiors.

408
00:34:20,551 --> 00:34:22,093
那該是多么尷尬的事情啊
Now that would be an embarrassment.

409
00:34:22,094 --> 00:34:25,934
聲名狼藉的賊卻因為假扮成你而得到認可
Notorious thief gaining admittance pretending to be you.

410
00:34:26,307 --> 00:34:28,340
韋伯 你的工作很出色嘛
Great police work, Weber.

411
00:34:28,341 --> 00:34:31,206
我們應該在事情結束以后到警局談談
We should discuss my police work when this is all over.

412
00:34:31,207 --> 00:34:31,947
嗯
Hmm.

413
00:34:32,855 --> 00:34:35,980
你這位朋友是誰   喬斯達桑
- Who's your sidekick? - Jules Dassin.

414
00:34:36,442 --> 00:34:40,012
很高興見到你 喬斯 我很喜歡看你的電影
Good to meet you, Jules. I love your movies.

415
00:34:40,237 --> 00:34:42,847
祝你們玩得開心 先生們
Enjoy the party, gents.

416
00:34:43,115 --> 00:34:44,920
小心點
While it lasts.

417
00:34:48,037 --> 00:34:52,182
好 你現在可以告訴我這一切都是怎么回事嗎？
Now... do you mind telling me what that was all about?

418
00:34:52,541 --> 00:34:55,506
只是一個警察罷了 真的 別開玩笑了
- Just a cop. - Really? No kidding.

419
00:34:57,129 --> 00:35:00,381
我們就從這個地方開始 我們要拿下這個地方
We have been made in the very place we are supposed to take down.

420
00:35:00,382 --> 00:35:03,067
準確地說 你是怎么出獄的
Exactly how do you stay out of jail?

421
00:35:03,594 --> 00:35:08,574
除非你跟這個韋伯是一伙的 你們共同設計要陷害我
Unless, of course, you and this Weber are partners trying to set me up.

422
00:35:09,767 --> 00:35:11,272
是嗎  Ripley ？
Are you, Ripley?

423
00:35:13,729 --> 00:35:14,644
我們走
Here we go.

424
00:35:15,147 --> 00:35:17,962
來呀 快點
Come on. Move your damn ass!

425
00:35:21,812 --> 00:35:24,372
韋伯不知道我們來這里干什么
Weber has no idea what we're here for.

426
00:35:24,456 --> 00:35:25,572
他當然知道
Of course he does.

427
00:35:25,873 --> 00:35:28,284
他不知道我們什么時候開始 也不知道我們用什么方式
He doesn't know when and he doesn't know how.

428
00:35:28,285 --> 00:35:30,578
還有 他不知道彩蛋的事
And, no, he doesn't know about the eggs.

429
00:35:30,579 --> 00:35:32,294
這里 沒有一個人知道
No one does. Here.

430
00:35:32,581 --> 00:35:33,806
避開韋伯最好的辦法
The best way to neutralise Weber...

431
00:35:33,807 --> 00:35:35,974
就是在忙亂中轉移他的注意力
is to fuel his obsession with busting me.

432
00:35:36,043 --> 00:35:39,504
他在那樣的情況下 根本不會像警察那樣思考了
He's so blinded by it, he no longer thinks like a cop. 

433
00:35:39,505 --> 00:35:40,130
相信我
Trust me.

434
00:35:40,131 --> 00:35:42,886
要怎么才能讓我相信你 啊
Give me a good reason to, huh?

435
00:35:43,033 --> 00:35:46,018
我已經給了你4000萬這個好理由了
I already gave you 40 million good reasons. Here.

436
00:35:47,221 --> 00:35:50,765
現在你們已經看到了大家所看的 是時候讓你們大飽眼福了
Now you've seen what the public sees, it's time for the real treat.

437
00:35:50,766 --> 00:35:54,853
那是 當然 你們要保證不會回來搶我們
That is, of course, as long as you promise not to come back and rob us.

438
00:35:54,854 --> 00:35:56,206
我不會記錄下來的
I guess I won't take any notes, then.

439
00:36:00,317 --> 00:36:02,360
我們的主要地下室
Our main vault. (Clicks fingers)

440
00:36:02,361 --> 00:36:04,426
螺旋探測儀
Gregor dlsarm the motlon detectors...

441
00:36:04,655 --> 00:36:07,198
跟所有的通信設備相連
Even with the knowledge of all protocols,

442
00:36:07,199 --> 00:36:09,054
真是堅不可摧
it is absolutely impregnable.

443
00:36:09,452 --> 00:36:12,746
聲感器會檢查我們的主腦安全 謝爾蓋耶夫 鮑利斯
The voice sensors ask our head of security, Boris Sergeev,

444
00:36:12,747 --> 00:36:14,998
實現記錄好的文字 隨機抽取設置
a random set of pre-recorded words.

445
00:36:14,999 --> 00:36:17,339
但這只是程式的一半
But this is only half the process.

446
00:36:18,210 --> 00:36:20,950
生物測定式手印感測器
We also have a biometric handprint sensor.

447
00:36:22,715 --> 00:36:26,342
既然謝爾蓋耶夫先生和我是唯有的兩位通關者
Since Mr. Sergeev and I are the only ones who have clearance,

448
00:36:26,343 --> 00:36:28,845
那就由我們兩個來打開地下室吧
we must both be present to open the vaults.

449
00:36:28,846 --> 00:36:31,765
一旦我開啟生物測定式手印感測器
Once I activate the biometric handprint sensor,

450
00:36:31,766 --> 00:36:33,986
它就會啟動聲感器
he must activate the voice sensor.

451
00:36:34,310 --> 00:36:37,395
這樣的話我們兩個都不能從彼此那里偷到任何東西
This way neither of us can steal from the other.

452
00:36:37,396 --> 00:36:39,206
你最好是祈禱謝爾蓋耶夫先生有健康的身體
Well, you better hope Mr. Sergeev stays healthy.

453
00:36:41,358 --> 00:36:43,406
我也必須保持健康的身體
(Zykov) I must stay healthy as well!

454
00:36:51,786 --> 00:36:53,906
漢堡包 漢堡包
- (Compuuter) Hamburger. - Hamburger.

455
00:36:57,374 --> 00:36:59,159
大蘋果  大蘋果
- Blg Apple. - Big Apple.

456
00:37:07,426 --> 00:37:08,516
耶穌 耶穌
Jesus Christ.

457
00:37:09,345 --> 00:37:12,975
時間一過地下室的門會自動重啟
(Zykov) The vault door automatlcally resets on the hour...

458
00:37:13,057 --> 00:37:14,906
那個時候感應器必須反向啟動
at which polnt the sensor must be actlvated in reverse...

459
00:37:15,607 --> 00:37:18,434
所有的人做好準備  別被關在里面了 
All In all gentlemen best not to get locked Inslde

460
00:37:20,523 --> 00:37:22,190
我說得是不是聽起來很容易
Well, did I say it was gonna be easy?

461
00:37:22,191 --> 00:37:25,671
不 但是你并沒有說不可能
No, but you didn't say it would be impossible either.

462
00:37:26,112 --> 00:37:27,587
防彈玻璃
(Zykov) Armoured glass...

463
00:37:27,905 --> 00:37:31,870
要想一次性打開它 得花半個小時
It would take half an hour to break through just one case.

464
00:37:32,410 --> 00:37:36,121
但是我想只要有人花上半秒鐘就會知道錯了
But, I'm afraid, whoever tried wouldn't even have half a second...

465
00:37:36,122 --> 00:37:39,958
超聲波探測儀會自動將其鎖在里面
because an ultrasonic motion detector would automatically lock him in...

466
00:37:39,959 --> 00:37:40,908
然后觸發報警器
and trigger the alarm.

467
00:37:40,909 --> 00:37:44,964
安保人員想要進入也并非易事
Contalnment securlty gentlemen Gettlng in is highly improbable...

468
00:37:45,004 --> 00:37:47,206
老實說 想要出來也是不可能的
But gettlng out is frankly imposslble.

469
00:37:47,207 --> 00:37:48,966
那道門通向哪里?
Where does that door lead to?

470
00:37:48,967 --> 00:37:53,137
通向我們的內室 那里藏了我們最寶貴的東西
(Zykov) To our inner vault which contalns our most precious items...

471
00:37:53,238 --> 00:37:55,505
很遺憾 但是出于安全需要
I'm sorry but security prevents me...

472
00:37:55,506 --> 00:37:57,900
我不能帶你們到那里去 即使你們是我尊貴的客人
from taking even this distinguished group in there.

473
00:37:57,901 --> 00:38:00,144
現在我們要返回接待廳了 但是在回去之前
Now we'll proceed back to the reception, but before we do...

474
00:38:00,245 --> 00:38:01,938
我還是要再次感謝你們
I'd like to, once again, thank you both...

475
00:38:01,939 --> 00:38:05,316
感謝你們去年來對我的關照
for your generosity this last year in helping set up our business.

476
00:38:05,317 --> 00:38:07,777
謝謝 還有你們的善意募捐
And thank you very much for the donatlon of that chopper.

477
00:38:07,778 --> 00:38:09,279
歡迎你們的光臨
(Zykov) You're quite welcome.

478
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:12,610
我們走 我們可以做到的 加布里
- Let's go. - We can do this, Gabriel.

479
00:38:12,825 --> 00:38:15,005
不 完全不可能的
No... Absolutely not.

480
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:20,505
- 我很高興 但是我要走了  拜拜      - 等一下，等一下
- It was a pleasure. Goodbye.      - Wait a minute. Wait.

481
00:38:21,167 --> 00:38:23,042
我們現在哪兒也不去
We're not going any where yet.

482
00:38:23,043 --> 00:38:25,962
如果zykov發現了那個攝像頭 他就會知道我們的事
If Zykov finds that camera, he's gonna know what it is.

483
00:38:25,963 --> 00:38:28,339
他們會改變所有的裝備的
They'll change all the protocols.

484
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:32,185
你到底明不明白啊 我沒有興趣
Which part of "I don't give a shit" do you not understand?

485
00:38:33,721 --> 00:38:34,691
俄語
(Speaks Russian)

486
00:38:43,230 --> 00:38:44,200
俄語
(Speaks Russian)

487
00:38:50,007 --> 00:38:50,992
Sorry. Let me just...

488
00:38:51,989 --> 00:38:54,099
不好意思 讓我
- I'll handle it. - No, no, no.

489
00:38:54,492 --> 00:38:56,659
我來處理 不不不
- Please, please. Allow me. - I'm absolutely okay.

490
00:38:56,660 --> 00:38:58,080
讓我來 我很好
I apologise, sir.

491
00:38:59,038 --> 00:38:59,488
我向你道歉

492
00:39:38,828 --> 00:39:39,848
搞什么
What the fuck?

493
00:39:41,122 --> 00:39:42,142
搞什么
What the fuck?

494
00:39:42,498 --> 00:39:46,126
韋伯探長 我是 Hal Donley 特工 專責此次行動
Detective Weber, I'm Hal Donley, special agent in charge of this op.

495
00:39:46,127 --> 00:39:49,712
你正在負責調查的那個嫌疑犯
You're conducting an investigation of a potential theft...

496
00:39:49,713 --> 00:39:51,923
正從羅曼珠寶店出來
that you assume is going down at Romanov Jewelers.

497
00:39:51,924 --> 00:39:53,869
嫌疑  才怪
Assume, my ass.

498
00:39:54,051 --> 00:39:57,262
我知道他們被記錄在案 我也知道他們就要成功逃脫了
I know it's going down and I know who's pulling it off.

499
00:39:57,263 --> 00:40:00,140
除了我要詢問你是否要呼叫你的手下
Except we're asking you to call off your dogs.

500
00:40:00,141 --> 00:40:02,392
有一些其他重要的事要做
There are other matters that take precedence.

501
00:40:02,393 --> 00:40:04,310
有什么要做的事
What could possibly take precedence...

502
00:40:04,311 --> 00:40:07,188
比抓住一個鉆石盜竊犯更重要
over the potential theft of millions of dollars in diamonds...

503
00:40:07,189 --> 00:40:11,769
他們化裝成NYPD還從珠寶店大搖大擺的出來
from a company that donates tons of money and equipment to the NYPD?

504
00:40:12,403 --> 00:40:13,268
瓦倫丁?
Valentin?

505
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:16,156
Vitaly Zykov 前蘇聯時代
Vitaly Zykov, in the old Soviet days,

506
00:40:16,157 --> 00:40:20,887
是一個叫 Dimitri Kuzin 的團伙老板  的  得力助手
was the right-hand man to a party boss named Dimitri Kuzin.

507
00:40:20,995 --> 00:40:26,275
Kuzin 在美國設立這個虛假而獨立  的  俄羅斯皇家鉆石中心
Kuzin set up a supposedly independent Russian diamond centre in America.

508
00:40:26,917 --> 00:40:27,817
羅曼的
Romanov's...

509
00:40:29,253 --> 00:40:32,998
但是鉆石．我對他一無所知
But diamonds... they're not all that he's shipping over here.

510
00:40:33,674 --> 00:40:35,967
他竊取俄羅斯國寶已久,   探員
He's ripping off the Russian Treasury, Detective.

511
00:40:35,968 --> 00:40:37,583
金，首飾，藝術品
Gold, gems, artworks.

512
00:40:38,763 --> 00:40:40,805
各位，你們覺得 羅曼 的錢由那來？
Gentlemen, where do you think Romanov's got the money...

513
00:40:40,806 --> 00:40:44,726
給你們的部門送直升機, 現在又送車？
to buy your department a helicopter and now police cars?

514
00:40:44,769 --> 00:40:46,644
錢是從鉆石貿易得來的嗎？
From retail diamond sales?

515
00:40:46,645 --> 00:40:50,845
那他們為什么那樣做？ 這是個嚴重問題嗎？
- So why are they doing this? - Is that a serious question?

516
00:40:51,317 --> 00:40:53,757
所以 NYPD 不要管他
So the NYPD will leave them alone.

517
00:40:53,944 --> 00:40:55,399
這才是正道
That's their mindset.

518
00:40:59,492 --> 00:41:01,993
我們需要 放長線 吊大魚
We need more time to build our mutual cases.

519
00:41:01,994 --> 00:41:04,746
這是為什么我們不作其他調查的原因
That's why we can't have any other investigations...

520
00:41:04,747 --> 00:41:06,622
以免驚動了 Zykov
potentially alerting Zykov.

521
00:41:11,170 --> 00:41:11,985
警長
Lieutenant...

522
00:41:14,423 --> 00:41:15,478
停止調查
shut it down.

523
00:41:17,551 --> 00:41:20,621
各位，解散
- Gentlemen. - Commissioner...

524
00:41:22,598 --> 00:41:25,809
為免你覺得比我們聰明
Just in case you think you're smarter than us,

525
00:41:25,810 --> 00:41:28,561
而暗中繼續進行調查
decide to continue this investigation on a down and low,

526
00:41:28,562 --> 00:41:29,392
算了吧
forget it.

527
00:41:29,897 --> 00:41:34,107
這件事比你想像的大，你明白了嗎？
This is bigger than you and your ego. Do you get it?

528
00:41:35,444 --> 00:41:36,359
我明白了
I get it.

529
00:41:40,408 --> 00:41:44,638
你說什么？  沒什么，一切照舊
- What did the feds have to say? - Nothing. Everything's still a go.

530
00:41:45,830 --> 00:41:49,855
第一步要越過保安攝像頭
(Ripley) The first order of business is to bypass the security cameras.

531
00:41:49,875 --> 00:41:52,919
如果我們能進入監控系統
(Martin) If we can gain access into the surveillance system,

532
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:57,360
我們可以換上預先錄制好的重復影像
we can replace the light feed with a continuous loop of study shots...

533
00:41:57,591 --> 00:41:59,361
而不被攝入保安攝錄機
with no face inside.

534
00:41:59,802 --> 00:42:01,928
還有聲波識別器
That still leaves the voice sensors,

535
00:42:01,929 --> 00:42:04,554
指紋和掃描器，動作探測器
the fingerprints, the motion detectors,

536
00:42:04,557 --> 00:42:08,522
從沒見過這樣的閥門
the meanest-looking vault door I have ever seen in my life.

538
00:42:33,210 --> 00:42:35,415
連彈簧驅動重鎖閂
with spring-driven relocking bolts.

539
00:42:35,921 --> 00:42:38,381
如果你把鎖撞開，其它的馬上上鎖
If you punch out the lock, they block retraction...

540
00:42:38,382 --> 00:42:41,342
即使知道組合也打不開
so that you couldn't open it even if you knew the combination.

541
00:42:41,343 --> 00:42:43,078
亞伯拉罕．林肯

30 pre-recorded words. One week, we've got them all.

544
00:42:49,807 --> 00:42:49,902
是，我們來維修的
Yes, we're going to be doing some maintenance work...

545
00:42:49,903 --> 00:42:51,936
請問是MTA公司嗎？
Dan McWilliams, MTA.

546
00:42:51,937 --> 00:42:55,814
下周在連接你的地下室的隧道內
in the subway adjacent to your basement next week.

547
00:42:55,815 --> 00:43:00,625
要在夜間工作，不想鉆具的噪音打擾到你們
We'll be working nights and didn't want the drilling to alarm you.

548
00:43:21,258 --> 00:43:23,758
超音波轉換器放這里
You place an ultrasonic transducer here,

549
00:43:24,011 --> 00:43:27,746
在特定的頻普上廣播傳送
broadcasting at the exact operating frequency of the transmitter...

550
00:43:27,932 --> 00:43:30,792
反射頻率到這個裝置
and it bounces back the frequency to the unit.

551
00:43:31,060 --> 00:43:32,445
基本的公式
At least in theory.

552
00:43:32,978 --> 00:43:35,808
你用過超音波轉換器嗎？
Have you ever used an ultrasonic transducer?

553
00:43:35,940 --> 00:43:36,475
沒有
Nope.

554
00:43:37,316 --> 00:43:40,026
那你能找來一個超音波轉換器嗎？
Can you get an ultrasonic transducer?

555
00:43:40,027 --> 00:43:41,778
朋友，我什么都能找來
I can get anything, my friend.

556
00:43:41,779 --> 00:43:45,824
- 你能通過密碼鍵嗎？    - 這是  如常地  是時間問題
- Can you get past a keypad?    - It is, as always, a question of time.

557
00:43:45,825 --> 00:43:47,575
一次處置一個問題
One tumbler at a time.

558
00:43:47,743 --> 00:43:50,803
這有點難  但可以
It is tight... but possible.

559
00:43:54,667 --> 00:43:55,707
俄語
(Speaking Russian)

560
00:44:08,723 --> 00:44:09,223
是你
You.

561
00:44:11,308 --> 00:44:11,843
是的
Yeah.

562
00:44:13,102 --> 00:44:13,567
是我
Me.

563
00:44:23,362 --> 00:44:24,782
有什么好笑的？
What's so funny?

564
00:44:26,198 --> 00:44:27,688
我討厭中國菜
I hate Chinese food.

565
00:44:28,925 --> 00:44:32,095
我絕對、完全不可能吃的
I absolutely, unequivocally

566
00:44:32,703 --> 00:44:34,833
我從不吃中國菜
irrevocably

567
00:44:34,907 --> 00:44:37,777
厭惡中國菜
loathe Chinese food.

568
00:44:37,977 --> 00:44:38,652
哦...
Oh...

569
00:44:40,207 --> 00:44:42,987
Leonid 我老板非常沉迷中國菜
Leonid, my boss, is addicted to Chinese food.

570
00:44:44,425 --> 00:44:46,380
我聞到也不成
I can't even stand the smell.

571
00:44:46,552 --> 00:44:48,962
我再次完全假設錯誤
Another completely wrong assumption.

572
00:44:49,972 --> 00:44:50,367
不
No.

573
00:44:52,475 --> 00:44:53,895
不是完全
It's not completely...

574
00:44:54,727 --> 00:44:55,297
錯了
wrong.

575
00:45:01,192 --> 00:45:01,797
什么？
What?

576
00:45:09,784 --> 00:45:10,319
喔...
Wow.

577
00:45:17,041 --> 00:45:20,231
- 你偷的   -是的
- You stole this.   - Yes, I did.

578
00:45:20,252 --> 00:45:23,532
- 是的   - 這才是我做的
- Didn't you?    - Yes. That's what I do.

579
00:46:08,307 --> 00:46:09,082
等等
Wait.

580
00:46:42,626 --> 00:46:44,546
現在有個問題
We have a problem.

581
00:46:46,088 --> 00:46:47,023
手鐲？
The bracelet?

582
00:46:49,425 --> 00:46:49,806
我會解決的
I cannot return it.

583
00:46:49,807 --> 00:46:50,187


584
00:46:52,762 --> 00:46:55,172
不，我喜歡
No, I like it.

585
00:46:56,766 --> 00:46:59,246
那你說的是什么問題？
So what could possibly be a problem?

586
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:01,920
你
You.

587
00:47:03,064 --> 00:47:04,189
- 什么？  - 我
- What?   - Me.

588
00:47:04,940 --> 00:47:07,540
我覺得這不是什么問題
I thought that part was not a problem.

589
00:47:07,818 --> 00:47:09,048
Ripley
(Laughs) And Ripley.

590
00:47:10,237 --> 00:47:11,882
那也不是問題
That part is a problem.

591
00:47:12,907 --> 00:47:16,472
只是 Ripley 這個人我無法信任
Yours and Ripley's is a world I just can't trust.

592
00:47:20,247 --> 00:47:22,067
你父親如何死的？
How did your father die?

593
00:47:24,210 --> 00:47:25,005
中槍
By gunshot.

594
00:47:26,545 --> 00:47:27,460
誰干的
Who did it?

595
00:47:28,380 --> 00:47:33,580
賭博，幾個俄羅斯人干的
He had gambling debts to a Russian gangster named Nicky Petrovich.

596
00:47:35,096 --> 00:47:37,786
- 俄羅斯人想要他的錢   - 問他要錢
- Nicky wants his money.   - Ask him.

597
00:47:38,099 --> 00:47:40,339
這么做不太仗義了
This concept of... huh, vorovosky...

598
00:47:40,893 --> 00:47:43,683
是的 我很熟悉這句話
"Vorovosky mlr", Yes, I'm familiar with it.

599
00:47:43,854 --> 00:47:47,479
但是誰該為此事負責？
Where... where one is responsible for the debts of another one.

600
00:47:47,608 --> 00:47:51,978
嘿 為什么那些人要你爸爸死而讓 Ripley 活著？
Hey, why would they kill your father and let Ripley live?

601
00:47:52,613 --> 00:47:56,099
因為 Ripley 有權  我不知道他是怎么
Because Ripley has... I don't know... how'd you want me to put this?

602
00:47:56,100 --> 00:47:57,810
得到權利的
Earning power.

603
00:48:00,496 --> 00:48:01,536
加比
(Whispers) Gaby...

604
00:48:03,165 --> 00:48:05,885
我不想再參加什么葬禮了
I don't wanna go to any more funerals.

605
00:48:10,214 --> 00:48:14,274
我想跟你在一起 但我不能給你什么承諾
I wanna be with you but I can't promise you that,

606
00:48:14,301 --> 00:48:19,281
而你也不能給我什么承諾 所以
and you can't promise me a thing, so...

607
00:48:20,516 --> 00:48:22,596
也許我們不妨試一試
maybe we shouldn't even try.

608
00:48:30,317 --> 00:48:31,907
哦 是你啊
Oh, you, you, you, you.

609
00:48:36,866 --> 00:48:37,521
上車
Get in.

610
00:48:48,127 --> 00:48:51,921
我知道你不想 我知道你也不會的 但是這樣會傷害她
I know you don't want to, I know you don't mean to, but you will hurt her.

611
00:48:51,922 --> 00:48:54,312
她不能夠受任何傷害
She doesn't need any more of that.

612
00:48:55,384 --> 00:48:59,249
你就一點關系都沒有嗎 我說對了嗎？
None of which you had anything to do with. Am I right?

613
00:49:00,973 --> 00:49:03,503
你有什么要問我的？
Is there something you want to ask me?

614
00:49:05,186 --> 00:49:05,616
是
Yes.

615
00:49:07,271 --> 00:49:10,651
為什么維克多死了而你還活著
Why is Victor dead and you're still walking round?

616
00:49:13,986 --> 00:49:17,781
我敢肯定阿歷克斯告訴了你維克多 實際上就是尼基 皮特魯維奇
I'm sure Alex told you that Victor was in deep to a man named Nicky Petrovich.

617
00:49:17,782 --> 00:49:20,825
她不知道的是尼基要一筆勾銷
What she didn't know, that Nicky was ready to forgive the dept,

618
00:49:20,826 --> 00:49:23,251
維克多接受了這份差事
if Victor pulled a job, this job.

619
00:49:23,412 --> 00:49:25,914
維克多沒有遵守諾言 他為了保護阿歷克斯
- Victor backed out? - He was trying to protect Alex.

620
00:49:25,915 --> 00:49:30,040
跟韋伯做了交易 他要放棄自己的自由
Made a deal with Weber. He was gonna drop the dime on Nicky.

621
00:49:30,336 --> 00:49:31,911
- 和你的    - 和我的
- And you.   - And me.

622
00:49:32,379 --> 00:49:35,019
韋伯為維克多提供了保護
Weber offered Victor witness protection.

623
00:49:35,091 --> 00:49:37,342
讓他和阿歷克斯走 但是阿歷克斯不想走
He and Alex, but Alex didn't want to go.

624
00:49:37,343 --> 00:49:40,323
維克多不能跟她一起走 所以
Victor didn't wanna go without her, so...

625
00:49:40,513 --> 00:49:42,298
他就吃了子彈
he bought a bullet instead.

626
00:49:42,556 --> 00:49:46,935
那么為什么這個還是你的問題呢 你為什么不離開
So why is this still your problem? Why don't you just... leave?

627
00:49:46,936 --> 00:49:51,648
你沒有跟尼基做交易 你大可以走開啊
You don't make a deal with Nicky for the throw of it and then walk away.

628
00:49:51,649 --> 00:49:54,943
事情還是沒有完  尼基想要那些彩蛋
There's no statute of limitations. Nicky wants those eggs.

629
00:49:54,944 --> 00:49:58,184
本來維克多的股份可以還清債的
Victor's share would have paid off his debt.

630
00:49:59,115 --> 00:50:02,492
我和他是搭檔 他對我有恩
Victor and I were partners. He was responsible for me.

631
00:50:02,493 --> 00:50:06,228
所以我要對他負責 幫他還債
So now I'm responsible for him and his debt.

632
00:50:07,698 --> 00:50:08,513
胡說八道
Bullshit.

633
00:50:08,624 --> 00:50:11,914
維克多不是死了 是走了
Victor is dead. Just walk away.

634
00:50:12,002 --> 00:50:15,727
- 那不是買賣選擇權   - 哇哦 只是一個...
- That's not an option.   - Oh, wow! This is just...

635
00:50:16,549 --> 00:50:17,259
聽著...
Look...

636
00:50:19,260 --> 00:50:20,540
我們做這份事
We do the job.

637
00:50:20,678 --> 00:50:23,471
尼基的事了后  我得一小部分
Nicky gets his cut, I take a small chunk,

638
00:50:23,472 --> 00:50:26,567
我不用冒什么風險
nowhere near commensurate with my risk,

639
00:50:26,809 --> 00:50:28,685
然后你可以得到可觀的2000萬
and you clear a cool 20 million.

640
00:50:28,686 --> 00:50:31,331
我不明白 只是...
I don't know. This is just...

641
00:50:31,731 --> 00:50:34,921
聽著 我們倆誰都不可以放棄
Look, either we pull this job off flawlessly...

642
00:50:35,276 --> 00:50:38,611
也不可以呼叫韋伯 你也不可以做證人尋求保護
or you call Weber and you ask for witness protection,

643
00:50:38,612 --> 00:50:40,280
那根本就不是你的選擇項
which isn't a choice at all...

644
00:50:40,281 --> 00:50:42,824
因為尼基會找到你并且會干掉你
because Nicky will find you and he will kill you.

645
00:50:42,825 --> 00:50:46,130
不論你走到哪 走多遠
It doesn't matter where you go or how long it takes.

646
00:50:46,454 --> 00:50:48,569
那都是不可改變的事實
That's an unalterable fact.

647
00:50:53,907 --> 00:50:54,287


648
00:50:57,097 --> 00:50:58,202
那好
Well...

649
00:51:03,387 --> 00:51:07,242
我們還是要去偷那該死的彩蛋
Then we steal the fucking eggs, no?

650
00:51:07,683 --> 00:51:08,113
是
Yes.

651
00:51:12,688 --> 00:51:13,638
哦 該死的
Oh, shit.

652
00:51:15,524 --> 00:51:20,404
我們要開始了 退后 謝謝
All right, we are working on it. So back off, please. Thank you.

653
00:51:21,030 --> 00:51:23,300
我覺得他應該叫我的名字
I think he called us a name.

654
00:51:25,242 --> 00:51:27,582
我們不喜歡被侮辱的感覺
We do not like to be insulted.

655
00:51:29,705 --> 00:51:30,395
對
All right.

656
00:52:50,453 --> 00:52:53,403
你知道這枚硬幣的重要性嗎？
Do you know the significance of this coin?

657
00:52:55,207 --> 00:52:55,742
知道
Yeah.

658
00:52:58,210 --> 00:53:02,714
那么僅僅通過事實你就可以知道它是屬于你的了
Then you must know by the mere fact that you have it in your possession,

659
00:53:02,715 --> 00:53:07,690
我無法想像你們倆可以超過我
I cannot assume the two of you will not attempt to double-cross me.

660
00:53:07,803 --> 00:53:12,483
沒有人會超過你 尼基 我們一直在嘗試
Nobody's gonna try to double-cross you, Nicky... We've been trying to...

661
00:53:14,361 --> 00:53:16,896
Ripley  尼基
(Ripley) Nicky...

662
00:53:17,897 --> 00:53:22,817
阿歷克斯 我很遺憾 是的 我們都感到遺憾 不是嗎？
- Alex... I'm so sorry. - Yeah, well, we're all sorry, aren't we?

663
00:53:22,818 --> 00:53:24,819
你沒資格把她帶到這里來
There's no reason for you to bring her here.

664
00:53:24,820 --> 00:53:28,390
你把硬幣給了他
The fact that you gave that coin to him...

665
00:53:28,557 --> 00:53:30,517
讓我覺得我有資格這樣做
tells me there are many reasons

666
00:53:31,035 --> 00:53:32,995
但我只在乎它
but only one I care about.

667
00:53:33,662 --> 00:53:35,663
為什么我們當初不背叛了你呢
Why would we try to betray you?

668
00:53:35,664 --> 00:53:39,734
喲   Ripley  換了是你 也許就背叛了
Well, Ripley, in your case, perhaps

669
00:53:39,919 --> 00:53:41,795
一副被復仇扭曲了的心靈
a misguided sense of revenge.

670
00:53:41,796 --> 00:53:44,826
也許 他天生就是貪婪
His, perhaps, simply greed.

671
00:53:45,132 --> 00:53:46,342

哪個法律上說了那些彩蛋是你的

Improvising.

829
01:10:39,507 --> 01:10:40,587

Shit. 

830
01:10:41,565 --> 01:10:43,845
- Take this shit off.    - Careful.

831
01:10:44,110 --> 01:10:46,528
- 快點     - 要抓住這個家伙
- (Siren)- Come on.    - Move around this guy.

(Ripley) There.

834
01:11:51,844 --> 01:11:52,274
嗯
Hmm.

835
01:11:52,970 --> 01:11:55,275
應該有兩個盒子的
There should be two of these boxes.

836
01:11:59,685 --> 01:12:00,375
對
All right.

837
01:12:26,907 --> 01:12:27,382
好
Okay.

838
01:12:51,946 --> 01:12:54,666
- 你干什么    - 把盒子給我
- What're you doing?    - Give me the box.

839
01:12:55,574 --> 01:12:58,709
- 加布里 別這樣    - 把盒子給我
- Gabriel, don't do this.    - Give me the box.

840
01:12:59,328 --> 01:13:02,622
什么 你想要更多的錢 天啊 你看看你周圍 想要多少拿多少
What, you want more money? Hell... look around you. Take what you want.

841
01:13:02,623 --> 01:13:04,958
閉嘴 把盒子給我
Just, shut up and give me the box.

842
01:13:06,794 --> 01:13:09,462
那阿歷克斯怎么辦 尼基會殺了她的 你知道的
What about Alex? Nicky will kill her. You know that.

843
01:13:09,463 --> 01:13:11,488
我再說最后一次
I will ask you one more time.

844
01:13:13,134 --> 01:13:15,459
你為什么要這樣做？
- Why are you doing this? - (Sighs)

845
01:13:16,095 --> 01:13:22,325
我是一個警察    在邁阿密潛伏了十年
I'm a cop...    In Miami for the last ten years.

846
01:13:22,517 --> 01:13:24,806
是韋伯派我來的    就是為了找你
Weber requested me.    Just for you.

847
01:13:28,733 --> 01:13:32,248
所以你是個警察 你想要抓我 來吧
So you're a cop. You wanna arrest me? Go ahead.

848
01:13:32,486 --> 01:13:34,026
我要到哪里去
Where am I gonna go?

849
01:13:34,405 --> 01:13:38,533
一分鐘之后地下室的門會自動關上 我們都會被困住
But in one minute that vault door's gonna lock and we'll be stuck in here...

850
01:13:38,534 --> 01:13:40,454
阿歷克斯就要死
and Alex is gonna be dead.

851
01:13:40,703 --> 01:13:42,780
我不相信你這種卑鄙小人
I can't believe you're such a contemptible human being...

852
01:13:42,781 --> 01:13:45,558
你連她都會利用然后殺了她
that you would use her like that and then just kill her...

853
01:13:45,559 --> 01:13:47,606
你會作繭自縛的
cos you might as well be pulling the trigger yourself.

854
01:13:47,607 --> 01:13:50,827
送掉 Keith   Ripley 的性命
Simply to bag the great Keith Ripley.

855
01:13:51,907 --> 01:13:54,942
你會后悔的 兔崽子
You sorry, sick motherfucker.

856
01:13:58,471 --> 01:14:01,626
你只有30秒了 我怎樣找到尼基

Give it to me... and the eggs.

859
01:14:08,481 --> 01:14:11,461
- 你想讓她活著還是死掉     - 你呢
- Do you want her alive or not?     - Do you?

860
01:14:24,830 --> 01:14:25,730
10秒了
Ten seconds.

861
01:14:28,334 --> 01:14:29,284
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

862
01:14:58,656 --> 01:15:00,289
同志們 到地下密室去
Underground, boys.

All right, let's move! Come on!

864

865
01:15:17,633 --> 01:15:19,240
監控室呼叫頂層，完畢

866
01:15:19,243 --> 01:15:19,983
喬治

柏格達，立刻檢查電梯

868
01:15:50,332 --> 01:15:52,902
聽我說 我是警官
I'm a police officer! Listen to me.

869
01:15:53,502 --> 01:15:55,628
地下室有一個竊賊被鎖住了
There is a thief locked in your inner vault.

870
01:15:55,629 --> 01:15:57,899
警衛在地下密室
The guard is in the basement closet.

871
01:15:58,132 --> 01:16:01,247

叫他們把槍放下
Tell them to put their weapons down now.

874
01:16:08,809 --> 01:16:09,309
馬上

875
01:16:10,770 --> 01:16:13,685
0K     好
Okay.     Fine.

Put them down

877
01:16:17,834 --> 01:16:18,234
馬上
Now!

878
01:16:18,527 --> 01:16:19,497
俄語
(Speaks Russian)

879
01:16:23,616 --> 01:16:25,841
踢開　快
Kick them. Now!

880
01:16:29,080 --> 01:16:30,395
你想怎么樣
What do you want?

881
01:16:31,123 --> 01:16:33,750
讓我從前門走出去 我就放了他
You let me out the front door so I can rejoin my unit.

882
01:16:33,751 --> 01:16:35,851
他們包圍了四周
They have the building surrounded.

883
01:16:35,920 --> 01:16:39,339
這時 你們下樓 會發現竊賊和他的同伙
Meantime, you go downstairs, you find your thief and your comrade.

884
01:16:39,340 --> 01:16:42,135
明白了嗎  那扇門會報警的
- You understand? - That door is alarmed.

885
01:16:42,176 --> 01:16:43,885
你有問題了 我們來解決它
You have a problem, solve it.

886
01:16:43,886 --> 01:16:47,431
別逼我 我會殺了他
Do not make me shoot this man, please.

887
01:16:52,645 --> 01:16:53,580
警報晌
(Alarm rings)

888
01:17:25,136 --> 01:17:27,053
把槍放下 我們是警察
- Put down your weapons. - We are police!

889
01:17:27,054 --> 01:17:29,744
是嗎 今晚怎么每個人都是警察啊
Yeah? Everybody's police tonight.

890
01:17:37,606 --> 01:17:38,436
喂
(Nlcky) Hello?

891
01:17:38,774 --> 01:17:44,024
嘿 我手上有你想要的東西  不，就是我
Hey, I have what you want.  No, it's just me.

892
01:18:04,258 --> 01:18:08,633
我們談談吧 我有個建議
Can we talk? I have a proposition for you.

893
01:18:19,523 --> 01:18:21,278
她在哪？
Where is she?

894
01:18:25,738 --> 01:18:28,628
不許動 他盒子后面有槍
Do not move. He has a gun behind the box.

895
01:18:30,076 --> 01:18:30,836
他媽的
Bad boy.

896
01:18:31,285 --> 01:18:34,662
把盒子給我 然后把你的武器交給安德雷
Give me the box and give Andrei your weapon, please.

897
01:18:34,663 --> 01:18:36,081
我們可不想惹上麻煩事
We don't wish trouble here.

898
01:18:36,082 --> 01:18:38,249
不 不 不 你不明白的
No, no, no. You don't understand.

899
01:18:38,250 --> 01:18:41,002
你放她走 我就把盒子給你
You let her go, then I'll give you the box.

900
01:18:41,003 --> 01:18:43,828
明白嗎 如果我打碎了這個盒子
You see, if I fire through this box,

901
01:18:44,632 --> 01:18:46,800
大家都什么都沒了
which I have no problem doing what so ever,

902
01:18:46,801 --> 01:18:48,593
尼基不會高興的
Nicky's not gonna be very happy.

903
01:18:48,594 --> 01:18:50,519
那我們都要完蛋了
Then we are all expendable.

904
01:18:51,806 --> 01:18:54,057
你應該明白我的意思
If you understand the meaning of the word.

905
01:18:54,058 --> 01:18:55,233
把盒子打開
Open the box.

906
01:18:57,144 --> 01:18:59,274
把槍放下 把槍放下
Lower the gun. Lower the gun.

907
01:18:59,563 --> 01:19:00,288
放下
Lower it.

908
01:19:06,028 --> 01:19:06,493
好
Okay.

909
01:19:15,538 --> 01:19:19,018
你還好吧 嗯 我很好 謝謝

910
01:19:19,166 --> 01:19:19,821
你走
You go.

911
01:19:29,301 --> 01:19:30,581
把盒子給我
Give me the box.

912
01:19:33,806 --> 01:19:35,121
上車 為什么
- Get in. - Why?

913
01:19:35,850 --> 01:19:37,460
尼基要見你
Nicky wants too see you.

914
01:19:40,020 --> 01:19:41,510
把你的槍給我
Give me your weapon.

915
01:19:42,940 --> 01:19:44,445
我們沒事 對嗎
We're fine, right?

916
01:19:53,409 --> 01:19:56,149
你們憑什么拘留我們
Where do you get off detaining us?

917
01:19:56,412 --> 01:19:58,288
我向你們道歉 韋伯警長
My apologies, Lieutenant Weber.

918
01:19:58,289 --> 01:20:01,074
我的手下們很困惑
My security were, understandably, confused.

919
01:20:01,250 --> 01:20:03,710
請跟謝爾蓋耶夫到地下室
Please go with Mr. Sergeev down to the vault.

920
01:20:03,711 --> 01:20:05,721
我們有你想要的
We have what you want. Please.

921
01:20:16,390 --> 01:20:19,875
另外一個人呢 沒有別人了 就是他
- Where's the other one? - Nobody else. Just him.

922
01:20:20,686 --> 01:20:22,626
我的人到哪里去了？
Where the hell's my man?

923
01:20:23,439 --> 01:20:28,509
警長 那是你的私事 不關我的事
Lieutenant, your personal life, none of my business.

924
01:20:29,987 --> 01:20:32,417
我很抱歉把你帶到這來
I apologise for bringing you here...

925
01:20:34,241 --> 01:20:38,411
但是我得確保我放你走之前彩蛋不是贗品
but I had to be sure the eggs were genuine before I let you go.

926
01:20:38,412 --> 01:20:42,552
你太不令人信任了 皮特魯維奇
Your lack of trust is really depressing, Mr. Petrovich.

927
01:20:45,044 --> 01:20:46,649
我說話算數
I'm a man of my word.

928
01:20:48,631 --> 01:20:51,426
她現在應該跟她的教父在一起了
She should be with her godfather now.

929
01:20:53,886 --> 01:20:54,836
等著瞧吧
Let's see.

930
01:20:56,597 --> 01:20:58,902
你介意嗎？   不  打吧
- Do you mind? - Sure... Call.

931
01:21:07,066 --> 01:21:07,531
我
Yeah.

932
01:21:13,489 --> 01:21:15,549
喂 是 你在哪？
- Hello? - Hey. Where are you?

933
01:21:17,284 --> 01:21:19,859
我在監獄里 我要見你
I'm at the jail. I had to see him.

934
01:21:20,079 --> 01:21:21,029
他怎么樣
How is he?

935
01:21:21,539 --> 01:21:23,248
你覺得呢
(Sighs) Well, how do you think he is?

936
01:21:23,249 --> 01:21:25,254
我別無選擇 阿歷克斯
I had no choice, Alex.

937
01:21:26,168 --> 01:21:27,168
大家都別無選擇
No one had a choice.

938
01:21:27,169 --> 01:21:32,579
還記得嗎 我告訴過你 我們誰都不能給什么承諾
Remember? I told you. Neither one of us could promise a thing.

939
01:21:32,717 --> 01:21:35,387
聽著 承諾只是過眼云煙
Listen, promises blow away in the wind.

940
01:21:35,720 --> 01:21:37,420
但感覺卻是真實的
But feelings are real.

941
01:21:37,763 --> 01:21:40,933
我知道 有時感覺也會騙人
And I need to know were the feelings lies, too?

942
01:21:42,642 --> 01:21:44,907
聽我說 聽我說 我的意思是
Listen, listen. What I mean is...

943
01:21:46,063 --> 01:21:47,953
你是真的嗎
are we real?

944
01:21:52,695 --> 01:21:56,520
我要走了 加布里 晚安 等等 別走
- I've gotta go, Gabriel. Good night. - Walt Don't go

945
01:21:57,825 --> 01:21:58,360
喂
Hold...

946
01:22:07,668 --> 01:22:09,568
你滿意了？
Are you satisfied?

947
01:22:18,345 --> 01:22:19,590
看了嗎？
Did you see them?

948
01:22:21,098 --> 01:22:23,973
我們根本沒時間看　　你看
- Actually, we were in a hurry. - Look.

949
01:22:34,904 --> 01:22:36,274
他們只是一些
They are simply...

950
01:22:37,323 --> 01:22:37,858
木頭
wood?

951
01:22:58,677 --> 01:23:00,652
天啊 只是些木頭
- Oh, my God: - Simply wood?

952
01:23:04,725 --> 01:23:06,475
是1917年的 加布里
It was 1917, Gabriel.

953
01:23:07,311 --> 01:23:09,551
俄國 那時候人們都在挨餓
Russia. People were starving.

954
01:23:09,605 --> 01:23:13,530
當時沒有珠寶和祖傳留下來
There were no jewels, no diamonds left.

955
01:23:13,692 --> 01:23:14,522
沒指望了
No hope.

956
01:23:16,404 --> 01:23:20,319
然而女皇的兒媳還是要彩蛋
Yet Czarina Alexandra had to have her eggs.

957
01:23:21,909 --> 01:23:25,384
也許你就能明白為什么那時候爆發了革命
Perhaps you understand why we had a revolution.

958
01:23:26,747 --> 01:23:29,107
人們需要一種信仰
People needed to believe in something.

959
01:23:32,253 --> 01:23:33,413
把他帶回去
Take him home.

960
01:23:40,386 --> 01:23:41,096
加布里
Gabriel.

961
01:23:45,224 --> 01:23:49,104
我知道他們是怎么說我的 但我不是殺手
I know what they say about me but I'm not a killer.

962
01:23:50,020 --> 01:23:52,790
一個卑微的移民
Merely a humble immigrant.

963
01:23:53,691 --> 01:23:55,146
跟你一樣
Probably much like you.

964
01:23:57,319 --> 01:23:59,884
我不這樣想 皮特魯維奇先生
I don't think so, Mr. Petrovich.

965
01:24:01,407 --> 01:24:03,397
你跟我一點都不像
You're not like me at all.

966
01:24:14,795 --> 01:24:18,330
很好 謝謝 我們找到皮特魯維奇了
Excellent. Thanks. We've got Petrovich.

967
01:24:18,340 --> 01:24:22,343
斯尼奇叫他進來 通過這段時間的尋找 你知道她到底在哪了嗎
Snitch called it in. After all this time looking for him, you know where he was?

968
01:24:22,344 --> 01:24:24,429
我肯定你會告訴我們的
I'm sure you'll tell us.

969
01:24:24,430 --> 01:24:26,514
躺在木地板上看日出
On the boardwalk, watchin ' the sun come up.

970
01:24:26,515 --> 01:24:29,405
他就要出現了 我馬上回來
He's coming in now. I'll be right back.

971
01:24:32,271 --> 01:24:36,601
是的 我可不依靠那些所謂的職業手
Yeah, what I didn't count on was that a so-called professional...

972
01:24:37,026 --> 01:24:39,194
都是一些沒有什么本事的人
would be manipulated by a chick.

973
01:24:39,195 --> 01:24:41,112
你在邁阿密是哪一類警察
What kind of cops do they make in Miami?

974
01:24:41,113 --> 01:24:43,383
好的那種 韋伯 好的那種
Good ones, Weber. Good ones.

975
01:24:43,491 --> 01:24:44,716
我不明白
I don't get it.

976
01:24:44,992 --> 01:24:49,257
這么多年了，你還能保證你還是你嗎？
All these years in that world. How do you let an asset use you?

977
01:24:50,289 --> 01:24:52,129
一些事情 改變了
Sometimes things... change.

978
01:24:52,917 --> 01:24:56,837
事情改變了？ 比如“我站在哪一邊”改變了？
Things change? Like, "which side am I on" change?

979
01:24:57,046 --> 01:24:59,672
Ripley ，他是誰 是你最好的朋友？
Ripley, what is he, your best friend now?

980
01:24:59,673 --> 01:25:01,841
事實上，我想比你更好
Actually, a better friend than you.

981
01:25:01,842 --> 01:25:05,000
嗯，我知道了，我是混蛋
Ah, I get it. I'm the asshole.

982
01:25:05,012 --> 01:25:07,222
你想告訴我你是個好人…
You're gonna tell me what a good guy he is...

983
01:25:07,223 --> 01:25:10,225
你想控制這個事態？
or how he got caught up in a situation he couldn't control,

984
01:25:10,226 --> 01:25:13,061
自己的女兒把他爸爸逮捕了
or how the sins of the father shouldn't rest on the daughter?

985
01:25:13,062 --> 01:25:15,772
告訴我事情改變了？
Give me something better than, "things change".

986
01:25:15,773 --> 01:25:20,588
如果我是你，我也會這么做的 我能給你的只有真相
All I can give you is the truth.

987
01:25:21,112 --> 01:25:25,967
噢，媽的 滾回邁阿密 媽的 回到邁阿密去，馬丁
Oh, fuck it. Go back to Miami, Martin.

988
01:25:27,118 --> 01:25:31,371
如果你上司給我報告 那你就有事做了
When your superiors get my report, you'll be lucky if you have a job.

989
01:25:31,372 --> 01:25:32,252
我知道
We'll see.

990
01:25:32,998 --> 01:25:35,041
嘿，說說有關 Ripley 的事
Hey, say anything you want about Ripley...

991
01:25:35,042 --> 01:25:37,711
沒有什么可以改變的 最后我會抓到他的
but nothing changes the fact that I finally got him.

992
01:25:37,712 --> 01:25:41,817
雖然目前他在監獄 他會變得很富有的
Now when he leaves prison, he'll be leaving in a pine box.

993
01:25:42,883 --> 01:25:44,998
讓我們去見見帕奇先生
Let's go see Mr. Petrovich.

994
01:25:59,233 --> 01:25:59,628
不
No.

995
01:26:06,407 --> 01:26:08,747
那不是尼基 帕奇
- That's not Nicky Petrovich. - What?

996
01:26:10,745 --> 01:26:11,505
不是他
Not him.

997
01:26:15,332 --> 01:26:18,251
看看，我已經確認是他 他就是尼基 帕奇
Look, man, Organised Crime confirmed it. That's Nicky Petrovich.

998
01:26:18,252 --> 01:26:20,867
好，我不在乎那是不是他
Well, I don't care. That's not him.

999
01:26:21,213 --> 01:26:22,983
我在那，還記得嗎？
I was there, remember?

1000
01:26:24,383 --> 01:26:26,288
不是這樣的情況，長官
There's no case here.

1001
01:26:26,677 --> 01:26:30,680
什么？ 不是這樣的 你真的認為我們信得過他？
- What? Of course there's a case. - You really think I'll put him on the stand?

1002
01:26:30,681 --> 01:26:34,309
一個潛伏在邁阿密的警察，他是否還在職呢？
An undercover Miami cop who may or may not be legit?

1003
01:26:34,310 --> 01:26:35,518
不需要了 真麻煩
- No offence. - None taken.

1004
01:26:35,519 --> 01:26:38,813
一個臥底警察應該遵守上級命令 隨時準備著…
A cop who's the centrepiece of a botched undercover operation...

1005
01:26:38,814 --> 01:26:40,844
停止工作的
that was officially ordered stopped?

1006
01:26:41,108 --> 01:26:44,027
我不想讓局里不安，特別是在你的辦公室里
I won't embarrass the Bureau, much less your department,

1007
01:26:44,028 --> 01:26:47,030
就是轉到那俄羅斯販毒的地方
which accepted tons of money and equipment from the Russian Mafia.

1008
01:26:47,031 --> 01:26:51,076
那寶物呢？ 那個該死的被偷的俄羅斯寶物呢？
What about Romanov's? What about the goddamn stolen treasures of Russia?

1009
01:26:51,077 --> 01:26:52,285
那韋伯呢？
What about it, Weber?

1010
01:26:52,286 --> 01:26:54,079
當Zykov發現 Ripley 在寶庫里的時候
When Zykov found Ripley in the vault,

1011
01:26:54,080 --> 01:26:56,664
當你進去的時候，他已經都清理完了
he had everything cleared out before you could get in.

1012
01:26:56,665 --> 01:26:58,865
我有個請求
(Ripley) I have a proposltlon for you.

1013
01:26:59,418 --> 01:27:02,462
羅曼不可能去控訴 Ripley 的
There's no way Romanov's will press charges against Ripley.

1014
01:27:02,463 --> 01:27:06,868
這會讓他們之前干的事情都包不住的
Cos they can never admit that the eggs or anything else ever existed.

1015
01:27:07,301 --> 01:27:10,387
我們只能假設馬丁探員
So we can't even prove that Detective Martin and Ripley.

1016
01:27:10,388 --> 01:27:11,221
偷走了所有東西
stole even a goddamn dime.

1017
01:27:11,222 --> 01:27:13,352
但是你們得殺死馬克
But you must have mug shots.

1018
01:27:13,766 --> 01:27:16,321
俄羅斯人這沒有同伙
Russian Mafia, known associates, something.

1019
01:27:39,750 --> 01:27:40,665
就是他
That's him.

1020
01:27:42,712 --> 01:27:44,462
那就是尼基 帕奇
That's Nicky Petrovich.

1021
01:27:44,630 --> 01:27:46,555
馬丁，是他？…
- Detective Martin... - Yeah?

1022
01:27:48,467 --> 01:27:50,077
那就開始吧
That's Victor Korolenko.

1023
01:28:01,522 --> 01:28:02,702
馬上就會死了
Presumed dead.

1024
01:28:03,941 --> 01:28:05,916
我們找不到尸體
We just never found the body.

1025
01:28:10,531 --> 01:28:11,846
找不到的…
You never will...

1026
01:28:13,617 --> 01:28:14,362
上尉
Lieutenant.

1027
01:29:00,498 --> 01:29:01,068
韋伯
Weber.

1028
01:29:02,375 --> 01:29:02,980
什么？
What?

1029
01:29:03,542 --> 01:29:07,170
在法官面前展示出來 然后宣判無罪了
His lawyer got him in front of a judge on an expedited bail hearing.

1030
01:29:07,171 --> 01:29:08,521
他剛走了
Then he just walked.

1031
01:29:08,798 --> 01:29:11,393
- 那是誰？    - 是誰？
- Who was it?    - Who was what?

1032
01:29:11,467 --> 01:29:15,067
- 律師     - 你以為律師是誰？
- The lawyer.    - Who the fuck do you think?

1033
01:29:15,346 --> 01:29:17,906
阿歷克斯
Alex. Korolenko.

1034
01:29:40,371 --> 01:29:43,936
你不能保證我一些事情…
You can't promise me anything so...

1035
01:29:43,999 --> 01:29:46,149
可能我們不應該去做的
maybe we shouldn't even try.

1036
01:30:26,917 --> 01:30:28,567
爸爸（俄語）
- Papa. - (Speaks Russian)

1037
01:30:30,755 --> 01:30:32,547
俄語 我們走吧
(Alex speaks Russian) Shall we go?

1038
01:30:32,548 --> 01:30:33,588
俄語
(Speaking Russian)

1039
01:30:44,435 --> 01:30:44,970
嗯？
Yeah?

1040
01:30:45,561 --> 01:30:48,188
不辭而別是不對的…
(Ripley) Didn't wanna leave without saylng goodbye...

1041
01:30:48,189 --> 01:30:50,084
你好吧
I owe you one Gaby.

1042
01:30:50,733 --> 01:30:55,206
這單邊的協議可不是好玩的
The real Nicky Petrovich is the one Zykov is funnelling the contraband through.

1043
01:30:55,404 --> 01:30:59,649
謝謝你，我不會忘記的
Thank you, but Zykov and Petrovich have gone to ground.

1044
01:30:59,658 --> 01:31:03,494
- 你跳迪斯高吧     - 玫瑰舞廳？
- Check out a disco called...    - Riga Rose?

1045
01:31:03,495 --> 01:31:05,930
嗯，我想你很熟悉那地方的
Ahh, I see you're famliar with the territory.

1046
01:31:05,964 --> 01:31:09,406
好的…我是個警察，別忘記了
Well... I am a cop, remember?

1047
01:31:09,409 --> 01:31:11,310
我時刻都不會忘記的
I never forgot it for a second.

1048
01:31:11,311 --> 01:31:12,741
你什么時候知道的？
When did you know?

1049
01:31:12,755 --> 01:31:16,290
我在邁阿密之前就知道了
I knew you were comlng up from Miaml before you did Gaby.

1050
01:31:16,675 --> 01:31:18,051
去看看韋伯和我…
See Weber and I...

1051
01:31:18,052 --> 01:31:20,887
當然，我們分享了相同的資訊
Well, let's just say we share the same sources

1052
01:31:20,888 --> 01:31:22,514
只是我有更多的報酬
only I pay better.

1053
01:31:22,515 --> 01:31:24,140
長官．我們要走了
Sir, we're good to go.

1054
01:31:24,141 --> 01:31:26,906
那你怎么幫助 Ripley 的？
So why the help Ripley?

1055
01:31:26,994 --> 01:31:28,949
可能是感覺有罪惡感？
Maybe feeling guilty?

1056
01:31:30,731 --> 01:31:33,071
我的辭匯里沒有罪惡
Guilt's not even in my vocabulary.

1057
01:31:33,317 --> 01:31:36,542
我只希望你從不同角度看事情
I was just hoping you'd see things differently.

1058
01:31:37,488 --> 01:31:40,193
我和你合作可以完成任何事
Together you and I could do anything.

1059
01:31:41,575 --> 01:31:44,520
是的．我相信
Yeah. I believe we did.

1060
01:31:44,912 --> 01:31:48,327
如果你有興趣，我稍后聯系你吧
I'll get in touch later on, if you're interested.

1061
01:31:48,374 --> 01:31:50,667
同時，我有東西給你準備著
Meanwhile, I've got to keep an appointment with a man...

1062
01:31:50,668 --> 01:31:52,794
豐厚的獎賞
who's gonna pay dearly for something...

1063
01:31:52,795 --> 01:31:57,035
在地下室做好開鎖 是他是那樣說的
he's got to keep locked in his basement just to say it's his.

1064
01:31:58,634 --> 01:32:01,394
親愛的．再見 等等．等等
- Good hunting, Gaby. - Wait, wait, wait!

1065
01:32:01,929 --> 01:32:03,596
讓我跟她說一會
Let me talk to her. Just for a second.

1066
01:32:03,597 --> 01:32:06,599
是他？  你想她會去哪里嗎？
- That's him? - What makes you think she's going anywhere?

1067
01:32:06,600 --> 01:32:08,184
她不會犯什么錯誤的
She didn't commit any crime.

1068
01:32:08,185 --> 01:32:11,445
她只是以其人之道還治其人之身
She just lied to someone who was lying to her.

1069
01:32:21,949 --> 01:32:23,039
你會更好的
You be good.

1070
01:32:24,118 --> 01:32:26,143
我試試吧． Keith 叔叔
I'll try, Uncle Keith.

1071
01:32:27,413 --> 01:32:31,763
我想我的合法職業結束了
Although I suspect my legal career just ended.

1072
01:32:31,876 --> 01:32:32,776
謝天謝地
Thank God.

1073
01:33:04,157 --> 01:33:07,700
我說你每天晚上都會來這里…
You come in here every night and every night I tell you...

1074
01:33:07,703 --> 01:33:10,303
聽起來我什么都不知道
I don't know shit from this Petrovich.

1075
01:33:11,374 --> 01:33:12,344
俄語
(Speaks Russian)

1076
01:33:12,875 --> 01:33:14,920
這是酒吧，朋友
This is a nightclub, my friend.

1077
01:33:15,419 --> 01:33:17,239
你知道我在想什么？
You know what I think?

1078
01:33:18,172 --> 01:33:22,675
我想你應該好好放松下自己了  你知道我在說什么吧
I think you need to check out the action and get your ass laid.  You know what I'm saying 

1079
01:33:22,676 --> 01:33:24,844
是的 老兄
Yeah.  dude?

1080
01:33:24,845 --> 01:33:26,335
好好享受吧
Find yourself a chick.

1081
01:33:38,984 --> 01:33:39,484
伏特加
Vodka. (Speaks Russian)

1082
01:33:39,485 --> 01:33:40,025
俄語

1083
01:33:40,277 --> 01:33:41,827
叫酒的意思

1084
01:33:42,971 --> 01:33:44,141
噢
Zakuska?

1085
01:33:45,032 --> 01:33:46,706
你餓了？      
Russian hors d'eurvres to coat the stomach.

1086
01:33:46,707 --> 01:33:47,912
我想是吧
Oh.

1087
01:33:48,994 --> 01:33:50,870
我認為你是不喝酒的
Will my stomach need coating? - 

1088
01:33:50,871 --> 01:33:51,321
你在想事情
I hope so.

1089
01:33:53,499 --> 01:33:55,474
和這事情沒有關系
I thought you didn't drink.

1090
01:33:56,127 --> 01:34:00,506
我想這不是我們該談論的事情
You thought a lot of things,but I believe I mentioned something about making assumptions.
