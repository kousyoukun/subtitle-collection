1
00:00:39,591 --> 00:00:42,973
这是我的朋友，杰里和玛姬·赛尔比。
These are my friends, Jerry and Marge Selbee.

2
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,050
他们住在密歇根的埃沃特。
They live in Evart, Michigan.

3
00:00:52,535 --> 00:00:56,297
这是一个并非全盛时期的小镇。
It's a small town that's not exactly in its prime.

4
00:00:56,401 --> 00:01:00,060
不过说实话，杰瑞和马姬也不是。
Though, to be honest, neither are Jerry and Marge.

5
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,512
今天，他们正在去买彩票的路上。
Today, they're on their way to buy lottery tickets.

6
00:01:04,616 --> 00:01:07,377
很多很多的彩票。
Lots and lots of lottery tickets.

7
00:01:08,758 --> 00:01:10,449
但他们不希望自己走运。
But they're not hoping to get lucky.

8
00:01:11,416 --> 00:01:14,246
你看，他们不需要运气。
You see, they don't need luck.

9
00:01:22,772 --> 00:01:25,085
但故事并不是从这里开始的。
But this story doesn't start there.

10
00:01:25,947 --> 00:01:38,753
故事从杰里开始，42年来，他每天都在黎明前起床，去玉米片厂工作，因为他担心这将是他最后一次上班。
It starts with Jerry, getting up before dawn just like he has every day for 42 years, going to work at the Corn Flakes factory, for what he fears will be the last time.

11
00:01:38,857 --> 00:01:41,273
这其实是个数学问题。
It's a math problem, really.

12
00:01:41,377 --> 00:01:51,766
如果你数一数，除了"I "这个字母，因为它看起来像"1"所以省略了，你就会发现"J"是二月。
If you count the letters, uh, except the letter "I," which they skip because it looks like a "1", then you realize that "J" is February.

13
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:55,943
然后，最后一个字母……哦,男孩。
And then, the last letter... Oh, boy.

14
00:01:56,046 --> 00:02:03,537
这就指定了植物代码，不容易弄清楚，但是，呃…我做到了。
That designates the plant code, which was not easy to figure out, but, uh... I did.

15
00:02:05,608 --> 00:02:09,439
杰瑞，你没必要这么努力工作。你退休。
Jerry, you don't have to work so hard. You're retiring.

16
00:02:11,096 --> 00:02:20,174
嗯,是的。但是…我…我不需要这样。嗯…我知道我的电话挂断了，但是…你知道的，我对数字有一种情结。
Well, yeah. But... I... I don't have to be. Um... I know my line is shutting down, but... You know, I have a thing with numbers.

17
00:02:20,278 --> 00:02:21,727
来吧。
Come on.

18
00:02:21,831 --> 00:02:25,214
你已经服完刑了。这是你的黄金岁月。
You've served your time. These are your golden years.

19
00:02:25,317 --> 00:02:28,286
他是我们最好的部门经理，对吧?
He's the best line manager we ever had, right?

20
00:02:28,389 --> 00:02:29,632
绝对的。
Absolutely.

21
00:02:29,735 --> 00:02:34,119
嘿。不如你告诉他们你是怎么从高中开始在这里工作的?
Hey. Why don't you tell these guys how you started working here in high school?

22
00:02:35,016 --> 00:02:37,571
你上夜班，对吧?
You worked nights, right?

23
00:02:52,137 --> 00:02:53,794
杰里。——好的。
To Jerry.- All right.

24
00:02:53,897 --> 00:02:58,005
不是每个人都能坚持42年不被解雇的。
Not everybody can pull off 42 years without getting fired.

25
00:02:58,108 --> 00:03:00,904
现在你的老板会让你睡个懒觉。
And now you have a boss who's going to let you sleep in.

26
00:03:01,629 --> 00:03:02,975
也不会对我大吼大叫。
And won't yell at me.

27
00:03:03,079 --> 00:03:04,322
这么错了。
Wrong about that.Oh.

28
00:03:05,978 --> 00:03:09,672
你应该去考房地产执照，就像霍华德那样。
You know, you should get your real estate license, just like Howard did.

29
00:03:09,775 --> 00:03:10,845
这就像有一份工作。
It's like having a job.

30
00:03:10,949 --> 00:03:14,504
但这也像退休一样，因为你什么都不用做。
But it's also like being retired, because you don't do anything.

31
00:03:14,608 --> 00:03:15,919
这是真的。
It's true.

32
00:03:16,023 --> 00:03:17,583
大多数时候，我都不出家门。
Most days, I don't even leave the house.

33
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:21,304
嗯…你知道，我会成功的。
Well... You know, I'll make it work.

34
00:03:21,408 --> 00:03:24,031
你知道，我总能帮马姬做家务。
You know, I can always help Marge around the house.

35
00:03:24,134 --> 00:03:25,791
不，你不需要这么做。
No, you don't need to do that.

36
00:03:25,895 --> 00:03:27,241
不，我很乐意。
No, I'd be happy to.

37
00:03:27,345 --> 00:03:29,588
我是说，你照顾这个地方这么多年了。
I mean, you've been taking care of this place for years.

38
00:03:29,692 --> 00:03:30,865
我有一个系统。
I kind of have a system.

39
00:03:30,969 --> 00:03:32,488
是啊，而且还不错。
Oh, yeah, and a good one.

40
00:03:32,591 --> 00:03:35,387
但是，你知道，每个系统都可以改进。
But, you know, every system can use an improvement.

41
00:03:35,491 --> 00:03:36,561
哦,上帝。我们开始吧。
Oh, God. Here we go.

42
00:03:36,664 --> 00:03:38,010
嘿。我有个主意。是吗?
Hey. I got an idea. Yeah?

43
00:03:38,114 --> 00:03:41,151
为什么不让我去你们的一些工作网站做咨询呢?
Why don't I try consulting on some of your job sites?

44
00:03:41,255 --> 00:03:43,740
你知道的，想办法让事情变得更好。
You know, find ways of making things run better.Ah.

45
00:03:43,844 --> 00:03:48,504
你想在我的工地走来走去告诉我哪里做错了吗?现钞。
You wanna walk around on my construction site and tell me what I'm doing wrong? Oof.

46
00:03:48,607 --> 00:03:49,677
我不会要价太高的。
I wouldn't charge much.

47
00:03:49,781 --> 00:03:51,103
我还得付钱给你吗?
Oh, and I have to pay you for this?

48
00:03:51,127 --> 00:03:54,924
该死的正确的。-你也会过来教我妻子如何批改论文吗?
Darn right.- Are you going to also come by and teach my wife how to grade papers?

49
00:03:55,027 --> 00:03:57,306
嘿，爸爸，如果我住在这里，我会很高兴的。
Hey, Dad, if I lived here, I would welcome that.

50
00:03:57,409 --> 00:03:58,824
谢谢你,黎明。
Thank you, Dawn.

51
00:03:58,928 --> 00:04:00,128
我要接受你的建议。
I'm gonna take you up on that.

52
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:02,449
我以后要经常开车去大急流城。
I'm gonna drive down to Grand Rapids more often.

53
00:04:02,863 --> 00:04:04,105
哦,哎呀。
Oh, whoops.

54
00:04:04,209 --> 00:04:05,209
你卖得太好了。
You sold it too well.

55
00:04:05,279 --> 00:04:06,498
闭嘴。结果却适得其反。
Shut up. Backfired right in your face.

56
00:04:06,522 --> 00:04:07,557
是的,亲爱的?好吧。
Yeah, sweetie? Okay.

57
00:04:07,661 --> 00:04:08,869
我们能给爷爷看吗?
Can we show Pop Pop?

58
00:04:08,972 --> 00:04:11,492
你想现在就给爷爷看吗?
Uh, yeah, you wanna show Pop Pop right now?

59
00:04:11,596 --> 00:04:12,769
给我看什么?
Show me what?

60
00:04:12,873 --> 00:04:15,393
我们给你准备了退休礼物。——惊喜。
We got you a retirement present.- Surprise.

61
00:04:15,496 --> 00:04:17,291
好吧。
Okay.

62
00:04:17,395 --> 00:04:18,913
睁开你的眼睛。——开放。
Open your eyes.- Open.

63
00:04:19,017 --> 00:04:20,708
不会吧!
Holy cow!

64
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:28,026
一艘渔船。什么……我喜欢钓鱼吗?我该怎么办?好吧。是的，你带过我一次。
A fishing boat. What... Do I like fishing? I do? Okay. Yeah, you took me once.

65
00:04:28,129 --> 00:04:29,649
现在你想什么时候走都可以了。
Yeah, now you can go whenever you want.

66
00:04:29,717 --> 00:04:31,201
是啊，怎么样?
Yeah, how about that?

67
00:04:32,237 --> 00:04:34,066
这是伟大的。谢谢你！
This is great. Thank you.

68
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:36,828
谢谢，谢谢，谢谢。-哦,好的。
Thank you, thank you, thank you.- Oh, good.

69
00:04:36,931 --> 00:04:38,105
哦。-爸爸喜欢。
Oh.- Dad likes it.

70
00:04:38,208 --> 00:04:40,659
还有你，保守秘密。
And you, for keeping a secret.

71
00:04:42,178 --> 00:04:43,248
谢谢你,南瓜。
Thank you, pumpkin.

72
00:04:43,352 --> 00:04:44,525
谢谢你,道格。你喜欢它吗?
Thank you, Doug. You like it?

73
00:04:44,629 --> 00:04:45,975
是的。——好的。
Yeah.- All right.

74
00:04:46,389 --> 00:04:47,528
我的天啊。
My goodness.

75
00:04:47,632 --> 00:04:49,703
我的天啊。——好。你没有破坏它。
My goodness.- Good job. You didn't spoil it.

76
00:04:49,806 --> 00:04:52,395
那是你唯一的工作。你做得很好。你没事吧?
That was your one job. You did so good. You okay?

77
00:04:53,465 --> 00:04:55,536
哦,是的。是的。
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

78
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:02,854
我没有很多普通的衣服。
I don't have many regular clothes.

79
00:05:02,957 --> 00:05:04,856
都是工作服。
It's all work shirts.

80
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:06,478
我们可以给你买更多衣服。
Well, we can get you more clothes.

81
00:05:06,582 --> 00:05:07,583
嗯。
Hmm.

82
00:05:09,688 --> 00:05:11,172
这需要调整。
It'll be an adjustment.

83
00:05:11,897 --> 00:05:13,105
你会找到路的。
You'll find your way.

84
00:05:13,589 --> 00:05:14,797
嗯。
Hmm.

85
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:16,143
有你吗?
Have you?

86
00:05:16,246 --> 00:05:18,145
不是真的。但是我没有船。
Not really. But I don't have a boat.

87
00:05:20,837 --> 00:05:22,183
你想要这个吗?
You want this one?

88
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:23,771
不。
Nope.

89
00:05:57,667 --> 00:05:59,738
早上,莱昂。早上好,杰里。
Morning, Leon. Morning, Jerry.

90
00:06:06,952 --> 00:06:09,679
卡被拒绝了，海伦。我很抱歉。
Card was declined, Helen. I'm sorry.

91
00:06:09,783 --> 00:06:13,373
讨厌它。也许我有现金。让我……
Dang it. Maybe I have cash. Let me just...

92
00:06:16,997 --> 00:06:18,585
我知道你有这个能力。
I know you're good for it.

93
00:06:18,688 --> 00:06:19,793
谢谢你,莱昂。
Thanks, Leon.

94
00:06:32,909 --> 00:06:34,704
你在这里做什么?
What are you doing out here?

95
00:06:34,808 --> 00:06:35,981
我的约会是在9点。
My appointment is at-00.

96
00:06:36,085 --> 00:06:37,845
不，你说你10点来。
No, you said you'd come at-00.

97
00:06:37,949 --> 00:06:40,296
我没有其他预约。我有六个客户。
I don't have any other appointments. I have six clients.

98
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,435
好吧。
Okay.

99
00:06:41,539 --> 00:06:43,817
只有六个客户，你怎么谋生?
How do you make a living with only six clients?

100
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:47,648
我不喜欢。我刚成为一个在线旅行社。看到海报了吗?
I don't. I just became an online travel agent. See the posters?

101
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:51,065
哦,是的。
Oh, yeah.

102
00:06:51,169 --> 00:06:54,828
既然都在网上了，为什么还需要海报呢?
So, why do you need posters if it's online?

103
00:06:54,931 --> 00:06:56,588
因为它们是免费的。
Because they were free.

104
00:06:56,692 --> 00:06:59,729
为什么你总是要理解所有事情背后的原因?
Why do you always have to understand the reasoning behind everything?

105
00:06:59,833 --> 00:07:01,006
哦,好吧。
Oh, well.

106
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:03,664
只有这样我才能理清头绪。
It's the only way I can make sense of things.

107
00:07:04,872 --> 00:07:05,908
船怎么样了?
How's the boat?

108
00:07:06,736 --> 00:07:08,600
水还是太冷了。
Water's still too cold.

109
00:07:08,704 --> 00:07:11,914
你不下水。这就是这艘船的意义所在。
You don't get in the water. That's the point of the boat.

110
00:07:12,017 --> 00:07:14,088
嗯。我的账户是怎么回事?
Hmm. How's my account?

111
00:07:14,192 --> 00:07:15,642
说到冷……
Speaking of cold...

112
00:07:17,644 --> 00:07:21,820
2%的涨幅，听起来不算多，因为事实并非如此。
2% gains, which doesn't sound like much, because it isn't.

113
00:07:21,924 --> 00:07:23,615
听着，你得更有攻击性。
Look, you gotta be more aggressive.

114
00:07:23,719 --> 00:07:26,618
如果你让我投资股票，我可能会给你10%的收益。
If you let me put that in stocks, I could probably get you 10%.

115
00:07:26,722 --> 00:07:32,175
这只会让你的钱翻倍…7.27年。
That would double your money in only... 7.27 years.

116
00:07:33,729 --> 00:07:36,559
这是我今天唯一一次可以用它。
Literally the only time I was going to get to use that today.

117
00:07:36,663 --> 00:07:37,940
不。
Nope.

118
00:07:38,043 --> 00:07:39,459
这是我们的全部。
This is all we've got.

119
00:07:39,562 --> 00:07:41,219
我可不想拿它来赌博。
And I'm not about to gamble with it.

120
00:07:41,322 --> 00:07:47,605
这不是赌博。这似乎有风险，但市场……是啊，如果你输了，那就是赌博。
It's not gambling. It seems like a risk, but the market... Yeah, well, if you could lose it, it's gambling.

121
00:07:47,708 --> 00:07:49,445
我一个月后再打电话给你预约。
I'll call you in a month for my next appointment.

122
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:51,298
不需要预约，好的。
Don't need an appointment.Okay.

123
00:07:52,092 --> 00:07:53,403
把船开出去。
Take out the boat.

124
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:56,165
我可能会这么做。
I may just do that.

125
00:08:25,539 --> 00:08:26,713
哦!
Oh!

126
00:08:29,094 --> 00:08:30,199
不。
No.

127
00:08:39,933 --> 00:08:41,659
不会吧!
Holy cow!

128
00:08:51,323 --> 00:08:52,566
嘿,悲观主义者
Hey, Jer.

129
00:08:55,776 --> 00:09:00,436
什么是roll down?-就是头奖达到200万，但没人得到6个数字。
What's a roll down?- It's when the jackpot hits two million and nobody gets six numbers.

130
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:05,959
然后整个头奖就会落在得到三四个的人身上…无论什么。
Then the whole jackpot rolls down to the people who got three or four... Whatever.

131
00:09:06,062 --> 00:09:07,374
更好的机会。
Just better odds.

132
00:09:07,477 --> 00:09:09,583
祝你好运。Yeah.Thanks。
Good luck. Yeah.Thanks.

133
00:09:10,273 --> 00:09:11,689
更好的机会。
Better odds.

134
00:10:03,395 --> 00:10:04,845
这是对的吗?
Can that be right?

135
00:10:06,709 --> 00:10:07,814
好吧。
All right.

136
00:10:15,994 --> 00:10:17,927
这不是赌博。
It's not gambling.

137
00:10:18,031 --> 00:10:21,862
彩票吗?是的。每次都有赢的方法。
The lottery? Yup. There's a way to win every time.

138
00:10:21,966 --> 00:10:22,967
你中风了吗?
Are you having a stroke?

139
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:26,015
有一个他们没有发现的漏洞，它就在数学中。
There's a loophole they didn't see, and it's right here in the math.

140
00:10:26,039 --> 00:10:35,911
现在，在一次典型的抽奖中，你有54分之一的机会中6个数字中的3个，和1500分之一的机会中4个。
Now, on a typical drawing, you'd have a one in 54 chance of hitting three out of six numbers, and a one in 1,500 chance of hitting four.

141
00:10:36,014 --> 00:10:37,360
很有可能你每次都输。
Odds are you'll lose every time.

142
00:10:37,464 --> 00:10:38,534
不是每一次。
Not every time.

143
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:40,985
我上周赢了一张免费的票，结果输了。
I won a free ticket last week, which lost.

144
00:10:41,088 --> 00:10:49,303
但在下一周，较低数字的奖金会高于你愿意支付的金额。
But on the roll down weeks, the payouts to the lower numbers increases above the amount that you would pay to play.

145
00:10:49,407 --> 00:10:52,306
所以，数学对你有利。
So, the math is in your favor.

146
00:10:52,859 --> 00:10:53,722
他们错过了。
And they missed it.

147
00:10:53,825 --> 00:10:55,585
我不知道这是什么意思。
I don't know what this says.

148
00:10:55,689 --> 00:10:58,727
看起来像是一个疯子在牢房墙上画的数字。
Looks like the numbers a crazy man drew on his cell wall.

149
00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:02,109
这意味着在接下来的几周，你肯定会赢。
It means that on the roll down weeks, you're guaranteed to win.

150
00:11:02,213 --> 00:11:03,870
这不可能是真的。
That can't be true.

151
00:11:03,973 --> 00:11:07,080
为什么不呢?因为这是彩票，杰瑞。
Why not? Because it's the lottery, Jerry.

152
00:11:07,183 --> 00:11:11,809
在底特律有一群人，他们的工作就是知道数字是如何工作的。他们做的事。
There's a building of people in Detroit whose job it is to know how the numbers work. And they do.

153
00:11:13,155 --> 00:11:16,365
真不敢相信你是我的会计。
I cannot believe you are my accountant.

154
00:11:17,159 --> 00:11:18,263
兼职会计。
Part-time accountant.

155
00:11:18,367 --> 00:11:20,541
全职在线旅行社。
Full-time online travel agent.

156
00:11:29,033 --> 00:11:30,068
嘿,明迪。
Hey, Mindy.

157
00:11:30,172 --> 00:11:32,036
嘿,杰瑞。存款?
Hey, Jerry. Making a deposit?

158
00:11:32,139 --> 00:11:38,111
哦,不…我…我想取2000美元。
Uh, no... I... I'd like to withdraw $2,000.

159
00:11:38,801 --> 00:11:39,801
是的。
Yep.

160
00:11:41,942 --> 00:11:43,703
你的脚怎么样了?
So, how are your feet?

161
00:11:43,806 --> 00:11:45,152
是更好的。
Been better.

162
00:11:45,256 --> 00:11:49,191
滚动网球有帮助，直到我的经理被它绊了一下，把它扔到了街上。
Rolling the tennis ball helped, until my manager tripped on it and threw it into the street.

163
00:11:49,294 --> 00:11:50,606
我可以再给您拿一份来。
I can bring you another one.

164
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:52,815
它们是三个一组的。
They come in threes.Thanks.

165
00:11:57,302 --> 00:11:58,579
噢,谢谢你。
Oh, thank you.

166
00:11:58,683 --> 00:12:01,272
我过几天会带着押金回来。
I'll be back in a couple of days with a deposit.

167
00:12:01,375 --> 00:12:02,583
好吧。
Okay.

168
00:12:04,862 --> 00:12:05,655
哦。
Oh.

169
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:09,004
可能比这个多20%
Probably be 20% more than this.

170
00:12:09,107 --> 00:12:10,108
给予或获得。
Give or take.

171
00:12:10,212 --> 00:12:11,592
then.Okay见到你。
See you then.Okay.

172
00:12:38,136 --> 00:12:39,448
谢谢你！
Thank you.

173
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:41,519
好吧。祝你今天愉快。
Okay. Have a good day.

174
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:49,078
两千张WinFall门票。
Two thousand WinFall tickets.

175
00:12:50,493 --> 00:12:51,771
二千年?
Two thousand?

176
00:12:52,288 --> 00:12:53,531
是的,女士。
Yes, ma'am.

177
00:13:00,676 --> 00:13:05,577
大家晚上好，欢迎参加本周的WinFall抽奖活动。
Good evening, folks, and welcome to this week's WinFall lottery roll down.

178
00:13:05,681 --> 00:13:09,305
拿好你们的票，坐下来，我们直接开始吧。
Grab your tickets, have a seat and let's get right to it.

179
00:13:09,409 --> 00:13:12,550
第一个幸运数字是6。
The first lucky number is six.

180
00:13:12,653 --> 00:13:14,517
第二个数字…
The second number...

181
00:13:16,623 --> 00:13:17,969
23。
Twenty-three.

182
00:13:19,005 --> 00:13:20,938
你没事吧?哦,是的。没有更好的。
You okay? Oh, yeah. Never better.

183
00:13:23,112 --> 00:13:24,873
43。那艘船怎么样了?
Forty-three. So, how'd it go with the boat?

184
00:13:25,494 --> 00:13:31,051
哦,嗯…他们说他们能修好马达，但不是给我的。
Oh, uh... They said they can fix the motor, but it's not for me.

185
00:13:31,155 --> 00:13:33,709
我是说，我们本来就应该一起做事的，对吧?
I mean, we're supposed to be doing stuff together anyway, right?

186
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:35,469
31。
Thirty-one.

187
00:13:35,573 --> 00:13:41,199
你想看电影吗?-下一个中奖号码是…哦……不，我不是说现在- 10。
You want to watch a movie?- The next winning number is... Oh... No, I didn't mean right now.- Ten.

188
00:13:42,511 --> 00:13:44,616
所以,什么时候?嗯，我不知道。
Well, so, when? Well, I don't know.

189
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,204
我在看一个节目。
I'm watching a program.

190
00:13:47,136 --> 00:13:48,136
你看这个吗?
You're watching this?

191
00:13:48,172 --> 00:13:49,172
不。
No.

192
00:14:03,083 --> 00:14:07,294
43 31 10 32。
Forty-three, 31, 10, and 32.

193
00:14:07,398 --> 00:14:09,193
我们希望你是赢家。
And we hope you're a winner.

194
00:14:10,056 --> 00:14:11,126
一个……
One...

195
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,302
这是一个四。
That's one's four.

196
00:14:16,545 --> 00:14:18,788
21、28。
Twenty-one, 28.

197
00:14:19,513 --> 00:14:21,032
十六岁。
Sixteen.

198
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:35,564
问题是，没人知道这个小镇。
Problem is, nobody knows about this town.

199
00:14:35,667 --> 00:14:39,292
埃沃特应该开始以一美元的价格出售房子，就像托斯卡纳那样。
Evart should start selling houses for a dollar, like they do in Tuscany.

200
00:14:39,395 --> 00:14:40,914
吸引人。
Lure people here.

201
00:14:41,018 --> 00:14:42,916
一美元就能住在托斯卡纳?
We can live in Tuscany for a dollar?

202
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:44,228
一欧元。
Well, a Euro.

203
00:14:44,331 --> 00:14:45,470
这是一个美元。
That's a dollar.

204
00:14:45,574 --> 00:14:47,507
不，比那个多一点。
No, a little more than that.

205
00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:49,164
杰瑞，一欧元多少钱?
Jerry, how much is a Euro?

206
00:14:53,133 --> 00:14:54,133
杰里。
Jerry.

207
00:14:55,204 --> 00:14:56,205
哦。
Oh.

208
00:14:57,034 --> 00:14:58,034
对不起。
Sorry.

209
00:14:59,415 --> 00:15:00,830
嗯。
Mmm.

210
00:15:01,728 --> 00:15:02,936
浪漫满屋。
Full house.

211
00:15:03,695 --> 00:15:05,145
我们在玩杜松子酒。
We're playing gin.

212
00:15:05,249 --> 00:15:06,629
哦。
Oh.

213
00:15:13,222 --> 00:15:15,638
非常感谢。——好的。好吧,晚安。
Thank you so much.- All right. Well, goodnight.

214
00:15:15,742 --> 00:15:17,054
晚安。——照顾。
Goodnight.- Take care.

215
00:15:17,157 --> 00:15:19,194
祝你回家走得愉快。——好的。
Have a good walk home.- Okay.

216
00:15:20,091 --> 00:15:23,760
金酒、扑克、克里比奇，我都搞不懂。-你才不在乎你不在乎。
Gin, or poker, or cribbage, I get confused by them all. - You don't care. You don't care.

217
00:15:23,784 --> 00:15:25,925
拼字游戏。Scrabblenext。
Scrabble. Scrabblenext.

218
00:15:26,028 --> 00:15:27,133
好吧,晚上。
All right, night.

219
00:15:29,031 --> 00:15:31,240
你得告诉我发生了什么事。
You're going to have to tell me what's going on.

220
00:15:31,344 --> 00:15:33,242
我太老了，等不及了。
I'm too old to wait it out.

221
00:15:36,452 --> 00:15:41,043
哦……我错过了机会。
Oh... I missed my chance.

222
00:15:43,563 --> 00:15:45,220
我做了我该做的一切。
I did everything I was supposed to do.

223
00:15:46,014 --> 00:15:47,291
我必须做的一切。
Everything I had to do.

224
00:15:48,809 --> 00:15:51,191
现在再做别的都太晚了。
Now it's too late to do anything else.

225
00:15:52,261 --> 00:15:55,299
哦，你的生活还没有结束。
Oh, your life isn't over.

226
00:16:00,062 --> 00:16:02,030
每个人似乎都这么认为。
Everybody seems to think it is.

227
00:16:02,547 --> 00:16:03,686
嗯…
Well...

228
00:16:05,861 --> 00:16:07,725
见鬼，我什么都能做。
Heck, I can do anything.

229
00:16:07,828 --> 00:16:10,693
如果他们不切断我的生产线，我现在还在工厂。
I'd still be at the factory if they didn't cut my line.

230
00:16:12,626 --> 00:16:18,356
而是……这是我的黄金岁月。
But instead... These are my golden years.

231
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:23,465
是啊，事情没有按照你想要的方式发展，不代表它不会。
Yeah, just because things didn't work out the way you wanted, doesn't mean they won't.

232
00:16:23,568 --> 00:16:25,846
好运和坏都有。
Good luck happens, same as bad.

233
00:16:31,059 --> 00:16:32,059
什么?
What?

234
00:16:33,061 --> 00:16:36,029
祝你好运，和坏运气一样吗?
Good luck, it happens same as bad?

235
00:16:36,133 --> 00:16:38,998
是的。它只是math.Yeah。
Yeah. It's just math.Yeah.

236
00:16:39,101 --> 00:16:42,277
什么?哦,男人。什么是假。
What? Oh, man. What a dummy.

237
00:16:43,312 --> 00:16:44,555
不是你。我。
Not you. Me.

238
00:16:44,658 --> 00:16:46,902
你是一个天才。
You're a genius.

239
00:16:48,731 --> 00:16:50,216
样本大小。
Sample size.

240
00:16:51,941 --> 00:16:54,185
这就是我的错误所在。
That is where I went wrong.

241
00:16:54,289 --> 00:16:57,809
我没有计算概率的频率。
I didn't calculate the frequency of probability.

242
00:16:58,293 --> 00:16:59,294
这只是数学。
It's just math.

243
00:16:59,397 --> 00:17:01,261
哦，我不喜欢数学。
Oh, I don't like math.

244
00:17:01,365 --> 00:17:03,298
哦。哦,我很抱歉。
Oh. Oh, I'm sorry.

245
00:17:03,401 --> 00:17:14,240
来，我给你看看……在这里。所以，如果你把一枚硬币抛1000次，你仍然可能得到60%的正面。
Here, let me show you... Here. So, if you take a coin and you flipped it 1,000 times, you might still get 60% heads.

246
00:17:14,343 --> 00:17:20,763
但如果你投掷5000次，概率会接近50%
But if you flipped it 5,000 times, the probability gets closer to 50%.

247
00:17:20,867 --> 00:17:24,905
样本必须足够大，才能把运气排除在外。
The sample has to be large enough to take luck out of the equation.

248
00:17:25,009 --> 00:17:27,943
这是给你的。
And this is for you.

249
00:17:28,771 --> 00:17:31,326
你存一分钱吗?
Are you depositing a penny?

250
00:17:31,429 --> 00:17:34,087
不。不。
No. No.

251
00:17:34,467 --> 00:17:38,195
不。嗯…我想取钱。
No. Uh... I wanna make a withdrawal.

252
00:17:38,781 --> 00:17:41,336
4200美元。
$4,200.

253
00:17:43,027 --> 00:17:44,684
那我们还剩多少钱?
Oh, and how much does that leave us with?

254
00:17:44,787 --> 00:17:46,996
我检查。
I am checking.

255
00:17:49,309 --> 00:17:51,000
4点多一点。
A little over four.

256
00:17:51,415 --> 00:17:52,415
好吧。
Okay.

257
00:17:55,488 --> 00:17:57,179
那就6个吧。
Make it six, then.

258
00:17:58,353 --> 00:17:59,388
六个?嗯。
Six? Mmm-hmm.

259
00:18:06,947 --> 00:18:09,433
八?
Eight?

260
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,574
八? 8000美元。
Eight?$8,000.

261
00:18:13,402 --> 00:18:14,403
你确定吗?嗯。
Are you sure? Hmm.

262
00:18:17,613 --> 00:18:18,683
九十八年。
Ninety-eight.

263
00:18:22,894 --> 00:18:24,379
九十九年。
Ninety-nine.

264
00:18:26,519 --> 00:18:28,107
八千年。
Eight thousand.

265
00:18:30,488 --> 00:18:31,558
谢谢你,蚊。
Thank you, Midge.

266
00:18:32,249 --> 00:18:33,250
好了。
There we go.

267
00:18:33,353 --> 00:18:34,353
再见。
Bye-bye.

268
00:18:36,356 --> 00:18:38,462
每个小镇都有自己的特色。
You know, every town has a thing.

269
00:18:38,565 --> 00:18:39,877
我们需要一个东西。
We need a thing.

270
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:41,775
爵士音乐节怎么了?
What happened to jazz fest?

271
00:18:41,879 --> 00:18:44,330
我们没法让舞台保持正常。
Well, we couldn't keep the stage up to code.

272
00:18:44,433 --> 00:18:46,711
有个穿木屐的女孩正好掉进去了。
Oh, one of those clogger girls fell right through.

273
00:18:46,815 --> 00:18:48,127
哦,是的。
Oh, yeah.

274
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:49,507
爵士音乐节也赚了钱。
Jazz fest made money, too.

275
00:18:49,611 --> 00:18:52,441
我是说，不是那一年，因为那女孩起诉了我们。
I mean, not that year, because the girl sued us.Yeah.

276
00:18:52,545 --> 00:18:54,857
她很生气，因为我们还在鼓掌。
She was upset 'cause we were still clapping.

277
00:18:54,961 --> 00:18:56,859
我们以为这是表演的一部分。
We thought it was part of the show.

278
00:18:56,963 --> 00:18:58,171
哦。
Oh.

279
00:18:58,275 --> 00:19:02,175
对了，我们几个人今晚要集资买彩票。
By the way, a bunch of us are pooling money for the lottery tonight.

280
00:19:02,279 --> 00:19:04,729
他们在做滚下的事情，你可以赢得更多。
They're doing that roll down thing, where you can win more.

281
00:19:04,833 --> 00:19:07,801
我们不是买彩票的人。-这样最好不过了
We're not lottery people.- That's probably for the best.

282
00:19:07,905 --> 00:19:11,219
你知道吗，有些人会在这些东西上花上千美元?
You know, there are some people who blow thousands on those things?

283
00:19:11,322 --> 00:19:12,841
你对吧?-开始了。
You all right?- Here we go.

284
00:19:12,944 --> 00:19:14,888
有什么事吗?喝。-下错管道了。
What's the matter? Take the drink.- Down the wrong pipe.

285
00:19:14,912 --> 00:19:15,913
吃得太快了。
Eating too fast.

286
00:19:17,915 --> 00:19:19,123
是的。
Yeah.

287
00:19:22,264 --> 00:19:23,264
哦。
Ooh.

288
00:19:24,784 --> 00:19:26,165
四。
Four.

289
00:19:44,252 --> 00:19:45,252
喔!
Whoo.

290
00:20:06,895 --> 00:20:11,945
我是说，就像普通的旅行社，但它是在线的，所以当事情不顺利时，人们可以表现得像动物一样。
I mean, it's like a regular travel agent, but it's online, so people can act like animals when something doesn't work out.

291
00:20:11,969 --> 00:20:13,695
嘿，你应该去旅行。
Hey, you should be traveling.

292
00:20:13,798 --> 00:20:17,813
你和温迪以前经常坐游轮回来，什么都叫左舷和右舷。
You and Wendy used to go on all these cruises and come back and call everything port and starboard.

293
00:20:17,837 --> 00:20:19,159
我都不知道哪个是哪个。
I didn't even know which was which.

294
00:20:19,183 --> 00:20:21,150
这取决于你在哪个海洋上。
Depends which ocean you're on.

295
00:20:21,254 --> 00:20:23,739
嗯。不。不。——是的。
Hmm. No. No.- Yep.

296
00:20:23,843 --> 00:20:25,534
她会希望你开心的。
She'd want you to have fun.

297
00:20:25,638 --> 00:20:27,156
已经三年了。
It's been three years.

298
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:29,193
哦,小鬼。小鬼和汉堡。所有的吗?
Oh, brats. Brats and burgers. All?

299
00:20:29,297 --> 00:20:30,677
上面有奶酪。好的。
With cheese on it.Okay.

300
00:20:30,781 --> 00:20:32,092
小鬼和…哦。——切达干酪?
Brats and... Oh.- Cheddar?

301
00:20:32,196 --> 00:20:33,991
道格，你能帮我看一下烤架吗?
Doug, would you watch the grill for a second?

302
00:20:34,094 --> 00:20:36,062
看到了吗?这是个好时机。嗯?
See? This is a good time. Huh?

303
00:20:36,165 --> 00:20:37,857
嗯。我跟你说了，开车去是值得的。
Mmm. I told you it'd be worth the drive.

304
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:40,653
不，你说你不知道还剩多少个周末。
No, you said you didn't know how many weekends you have left.

305
00:20:40,756 --> 00:20:41,930
好吧,我不喜欢。
Well, I don't.

306
00:20:42,033 --> 00:20:45,105
是的，但是数学是有用的。
Yeah, but the math works.

307
00:20:45,209 --> 00:20:46,866
开两小时车，就能得到免费汉堡。
Drive for two hours, get a free burger.

308
00:20:46,969 --> 00:20:48,350
抵消了汽油的成本。
Offsets the cost of gas.

309
00:20:48,454 --> 00:20:49,731
我不吃肉，爸爸。
I don't eat meat, Dad.

310
00:20:49,834 --> 00:20:51,388
哦,对了。我去买鸡肉。
Oh, right. I'll get the chicken.

311
00:20:51,491 --> 00:20:52,699
不，那还是肉。
No, that's still meat.

312
00:20:52,803 --> 00:20:54,080
好吧。
Okay.

313
00:20:54,701 --> 00:20:55,944
他是好的吗?
Is he okay?

314
00:20:56,047 --> 00:20:59,741
他只是不知道怎么表达"我想你"
He just doesn't know the formula for "I miss you."

315
00:20:59,844 --> 00:21:01,097
有你在的时候会更有趣。
It is more fun when you're here.

316
00:21:01,121 --> 00:21:03,676
我知道，但你和爸爸，你们在一起会很开心的。
I know, but you and Dad, you gotta have fun together.

317
00:21:03,779 --> 00:21:04,849
是的。
Yeah.

318
00:21:04,953 --> 00:21:07,956
我知道你等他退休等了很久。我知道。
I know you've waited a really long time for him to retire. I know.

319
00:21:08,059 --> 00:21:10,303
我知道。我们需要努力。
I know. We need to work on it.

320
00:21:10,407 --> 00:21:15,515
我都不记得我们上次是什么时候…你知道吗?什么?
I can't even remember the last time that we had... You know? What?

321
00:21:15,619 --> 00:21:19,554
是的。哦，不，没关系。我不需要听你说……蜂蜜。
Yeah. Oh, no, that's okay. I don't need to hear about... Honey.

322
00:21:19,657 --> 00:21:20,969
我要去喝杯啤酒。
I'm gonna get a beer.

323
00:21:21,072 --> 00:21:22,867
好吧?好吧。我们会解决的。
Okay? Okay. We'll work on it.

324
00:21:22,971 --> 00:21:24,869
反正我也在考虑。——好的。
I'm thinking about it anyway.- Okay.

325
00:21:24,973 --> 00:21:26,285
我希望他会。
I wish he would.

326
00:21:28,425 --> 00:21:29,495
哇。
Whoa.

327
00:21:30,012 --> 00:21:31,082
哇,哇,哇!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

328
00:21:31,186 --> 00:21:33,844
不，丽萃，丽萃，丽萃!不不不，莉兹。
No, Lizzy, Lizzy, Lizzy! No, no, no, no, Liz.

329
00:21:33,947 --> 00:21:35,915
我们不要……我们不要打开它。
Let's not... Let's not open that.

330
00:21:36,018 --> 00:21:38,331
为什么?我想要爆米花。我知道。我知道。
Why? I want the popcorn. I know. I know.

331
00:21:38,435 --> 00:21:41,507
但这…这爆米花太不新鲜了。啊。
But this... this popcorn's very stale. Ugh.

332
00:21:41,610 --> 00:21:43,474
我喜欢陈旧。
I like stale.

333
00:21:43,578 --> 00:21:46,581
但这里面全是糖。这对你没有好处。
Well, but this is full of sugar. It's no good for you.

334
00:21:46,684 --> 00:21:49,446
我看见你吃了七块奥利奥。
I saw you eat seven Oreos.

335
00:21:50,792 --> 00:21:51,931
你想吃奥利奥吗?
You want an Oreo?

336
00:21:52,034 --> 00:21:53,553
你都吃了，爷爷。
You ate them all, Pop Pop.

337
00:21:55,003 --> 00:21:59,318
好吧。好吧。嗯…等我一分钟。
Okay. All right. Uh... Let me just have it for one minute.

338
00:21:59,421 --> 00:22:01,596
爷爷会还给你的。我保证。
Pop Pop will give it back to you. I promise.

339
00:22:01,699 --> 00:22:03,805
你现在相信爷爷了，对吧?
You trust Pop Pop now, right?

340
00:22:03,908 --> 00:22:05,979
让我花一分钟。
Let me just take one minute.

341
00:22:06,083 --> 00:22:07,326
我马上就出去。
And I'll be right out.

342
00:22:21,926 --> 00:22:23,652
给你。
Here you go.

343
00:22:23,756 --> 00:22:26,068
接受。谢谢,流行流行。
Take. Thanks, Pop Pop.

344
00:22:26,931 --> 00:22:28,208
是的。
Yep.

345
00:22:45,674 --> 00:22:47,089
有什么想告诉我的吗?
Something you wanna tell me?

346
00:22:47,918 --> 00:22:49,368
什么?
What?

347
00:22:49,471 --> 00:22:50,472
储藏室。
The pantry.

348
00:22:55,719 --> 00:22:57,376
我在买彩票。
I'm playing the lottery.

349
00:22:59,308 --> 00:23:01,483
我是说那袋空的奥利奥。
I meant the empty bag of Oreos.

350
00:23:05,487 --> 00:23:09,180
我在玩彩票，而且我要赢了。
I'm playing the lottery, and I'm winning.

351
00:23:09,284 --> 00:23:12,460
我算了一下，赢了一万五千美元。
I figured out the math, and I won $15,000.

352
00:23:12,563 --> 00:23:15,532
它被塞在磨砂迷你小麦盒子里。
It's stuffed inside the Frosted Mini-Wheats box.

353
00:23:16,671 --> 00:23:17,775
哇。
Wow.

354
00:23:23,574 --> 00:23:26,301
我给雪莉的彩票池捐了20美元。
I gave $20 to Shirley's lottery pool.

355
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:28,683
我想现在没什么大不了的了。
I guess it's not such a big deal now.

356
00:23:30,892 --> 00:23:34,136
我…我必须试一试。
I... I had to try it.

357
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:40,004
我…我在游戏中发现了这个缺陷，我必须弄清楚我的判断是否正确。
I... I found this flaw in the game, and I had to find out if I was right.

358
00:23:40,108 --> 00:23:41,799
那你为什么不直接告诉我?
Well, why didn't you just tell me?

359
00:23:42,524 --> 00:23:45,527
我…觉得自己很愚蠢。
I... felt silly.

360
00:23:45,631 --> 00:23:51,602
我们几乎没有足够的钱退休，而且……现在不是冒险的时候。
We barely have enough money to retire on as it is, and... This is no time to risk it.

361
00:23:54,018 --> 00:23:55,710
是的,它是。什么?
Yes, it is. What?

362
00:23:55,813 --> 00:23:56,918
是时候冒险了。
It's time to risk it.

363
00:23:57,021 --> 00:24:00,439
因为现在我们失去了更重要的东西。
Because right now we're losing something that matters even more.

364
00:24:01,578 --> 00:24:06,272
我已经等了四十年，希望只有我们两个人，但到目前为止，我们做得很糟糕。
I've waited 40 years for it to be just us, and so far we kind of suck at it.

365
00:24:07,376 --> 00:24:08,376
我们有危险。
We have Jeopardy.

366
00:24:08,447 --> 00:24:11,760
哦，这不是问题。杰里!
Oh, that's not a thing. Jerry!

367
00:24:11,864 --> 00:24:13,348
我想玩得开心。
I wanna have fun.

368
00:24:14,625 --> 00:24:16,282
我想玩得开心。
I wanna have fun.

369
00:24:19,009 --> 00:24:21,943
我们做点蠢事吧。嗯?
Let's be a little stupid. Huh?

370
00:24:22,046 --> 00:24:25,533
我们17岁就结婚了，所以我们知道该怎么做。
We got married when we were 17, so we know how to do it.

371
00:24:26,982 --> 00:24:28,225
嗯,这是真的。
Well, that's true.

372
00:24:29,329 --> 00:24:32,229
我们需要一些东西。
We need something for us.

373
00:24:34,403 --> 00:24:40,479
我没想到会是买彩票，但如果能让我们聊点什么，我也会去抢银行。
I didn't think it would be playing the lottery, but I'd rob a bank if it gave us something to talk about.

374
00:24:41,514 --> 00:24:42,584
好吧。
Okay.

375
00:24:42,688 --> 00:24:45,898
15000美元?是的。
$15,000?Yep.

376
00:24:48,728 --> 00:24:53,664
如果我们把一万五千美元全押上…哦,我们应该。我们全押上吧。你认为呢?
If we bet the whole $15,000... Oh, we should. Let's bet it all. You think?

377
00:24:53,768 --> 00:24:58,842
是啊，因为我也这么想。它是正确的…不。不，不，不。
Yeah, 'cause I was thinking the same thing. It's right... No. No, no, no, no.

378
00:24:58,945 --> 00:25:01,361
里昂，WinFall怎么了?
Leon, what happened to WinFall?

379
00:25:01,465 --> 00:25:03,502
哦,他们……他们逐步淘汰了它。
Oh, they... they phased it out.

380
00:25:03,605 --> 00:25:06,021
什么?它就这样消失了?
What? It's gone, just like that?

381
00:25:06,125 --> 00:25:07,644
反正你也不玩，对吧?
You don't play anyway, do you?

382
00:25:07,747 --> 00:25:12,925
不。好吧，我想现在人们只能在马萨诸塞州玩了。
No.Yeah, well, I guess people will just have to play the one in Massachusetts now.

383
00:25:15,410 --> 00:25:18,102
数学工作。你可以看到。你是一个会计。
The math works. You can see that. You're an accountant.

384
00:25:18,206 --> 00:25:20,864
是的。我的意思是……我是说，看起来是对的。
Yeah. I mean... I mean, it looks right.

385
00:25:20,967 --> 00:25:22,417
马萨诸塞州也不远。
And Massachusetts isn't that far.

386
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:26,076
不，如果我们的卡车不抛锚的话，大概只有10个小时的车程。
No, it's only about a 10-hour drive if our truck doesn't break down.

387
00:25:26,179 --> 00:25:27,974
如果有，我们就搭个车。
If it does, we'll get a ride.Yeah.

388
00:25:28,078 --> 00:25:29,424
从谁?
From whom?

389
00:25:29,528 --> 00:25:31,564
卡车司机。是的，他们总是在寻找同伴。
Truckers. Yeah, they're always looking for company.

390
00:25:31,668 --> 00:25:33,911
谋杀。如果情况变得奇怪，我们就跳出去。
To murder. We'll jump out if it gets weird.

391
00:25:34,015 --> 00:25:36,811
他们甚至不会知道我们有一大包现金。
And they won't even know that we have a duffle bag full of cash.

392
00:25:36,914 --> 00:25:39,123
是的，我们会把拉链拉上的。
Yeah, we'll keep that zipped up.

393
00:25:39,227 --> 00:25:41,678
好吧。好吧,什么?
All right. All right, what?

394
00:25:41,781 --> 00:25:42,851
我也在。
I'm in, too.

395
00:25:42,955 --> 00:25:44,888
你确定吗?——没有。
You sure?- No.

396
00:25:44,991 --> 00:25:48,477
但管他呢?给我投1000。
But what the hell? Put me in for 1,000.

397
00:25:48,581 --> 00:25:50,583
我刚要取消一个游轮旅行。
I just got a cruise I gotta cancel now.

398
00:26:06,461 --> 00:26:08,567
嘿。Oh.Oh。我们的晚餐。
Hey. Oh.Oh. Got our dinner.

399
00:26:08,670 --> 00:26:12,053
是的。我们需要三天的食物。
Yeah. We're going to need three days of food.

400
00:26:12,778 --> 00:26:13,675
哦。
Oh.

401
00:26:13,779 --> 00:26:15,781
我给我们找了个小镇玩。
And I found us a small town to play in.

402
00:26:16,333 --> 00:26:18,404
是的，保持安静。
Yeah, keep things quiet.

403
00:26:18,507 --> 00:26:22,270
就像我把车停在一个街区外的旧货市场。
You know, like how I park a block away at a good garage sale.

404
00:26:22,373 --> 00:26:23,754
是吗?Oh.Move。
Yeah? Oh.Move.

405
00:26:26,999 --> 00:26:29,208
你有业余无线电吗?什么?
You got a ham radio? What?

406
00:26:29,311 --> 00:26:31,210
业余无线电。我们要去一些死亡区。
Ham radio. We're gonna hit some dead zones.

407
00:26:31,313 --> 00:26:34,316
我想我可以去Ace…等一下。
I suppose I can go to Ace... Wait a minute.

408
00:26:35,490 --> 00:26:36,905
电池怎么样了?
How are we on batteries?

409
00:26:37,009 --> 00:26:41,703
嗯…我…啊。
Uh... I... Ah.

410
00:26:41,807 --> 00:26:45,673
好吧。我们再去买一些吧。以防。
Okay. Let's get some more. Just in case.

411
00:26:45,776 --> 00:26:47,813
感觉我们真的是在抢银行。
Feels like we really are robbing a bank.

412
00:26:47,916 --> 00:26:51,264
不。会更有趣的。你把。
Nah. It's gonna be more fun. You take that.

413
00:26:51,368 --> 00:26:53,094
给你钥匙。
Here are the keys.

414
00:26:53,197 --> 00:26:54,958
好吧。啊。
All right. Aah.

415
00:26:55,061 --> 00:26:57,236
我有优惠券。
I got the coupons.

416
00:26:57,339 --> 00:26:58,651
好吧。你抓住。
All right. You grab that.

417
00:26:58,755 --> 00:27:00,722
哦,现在呢?哦。
Oh, now? Oh.

418
00:27:00,826 --> 00:27:02,103
让我们go.Oh。
Let's go.Oh.

419
00:27:02,206 --> 00:27:04,105
我可以先穿衣服吗?
Can I get dressed first?

420
00:27:09,075 --> 00:27:11,353
Mmm.Whoo。
Mmm.Whoo.

421
00:27:11,457 --> 00:27:12,803
你有饼干吗?
You have cookies?

422
00:27:18,291 --> 00:27:20,086
哦。
Ooh.

423
00:27:56,605 --> 00:27:57,883
看起来不太像。
Doesn't look like much.

424
00:27:57,986 --> 00:28:01,093
我们只需要一台售票机，对吧?
Well, all we need is a ticket machine, right?

425
00:28:06,719 --> 00:28:10,343
嘿，孩子，这些是买一送一的，因为它们太过时了。
Hey, kid, those are buy one, get one free, 'cause they're so out of date.

426
00:28:10,447 --> 00:28:14,900
这是2013年的，但还是会让你的嘴变蓝。
They're from 2013, but they'll still turn your mouth blue.

427
00:28:16,798 --> 00:28:18,489
事实上，我要先去拿。
Actually, I'm gonna get them first.

428
00:28:18,593 --> 00:28:20,457
我能为您做些什么?
How can I help you?

429
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:23,874
我们想买八千张《WinFall》的门票。
We'd like to buy 8,000 WinFall tickets.

430
00:28:25,842 --> 00:28:27,188
我先去找你。
I'm gonna get you first.

431
00:28:30,605 --> 00:28:32,089
这远远不够。
No way is this enough.

432
00:28:33,401 --> 00:28:34,747
这绝对不够。
There's no way that was enough.

433
00:28:35,230 --> 00:28:41,927
嗯…八千张《WinFall》门票…29000美元。
Uh... Eight thousand WinFall tickets is, like... $29,000.

434
00:28:42,030 --> 00:28:44,688
16000。16000美元。
No. 16,000.$16,000.

435
00:28:44,792 --> 00:28:47,587
这就是我们带来的。
And that is how much we brought.

436
00:28:49,486 --> 00:28:52,800
机器每小时打印1000张票，所以你要在这里待一整天。
Well, the machine prints 1,000 tickets an hour, so you'll be here all day.

437
00:28:52,903 --> 00:28:55,492
根据我的经验，在这里待一天太糟糕了。
And let me tell you from experience, being here all day sucks.

438
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:58,046
因为我一整天都在这里。
Because I'm here all day.

439
00:28:59,772 --> 00:29:03,914
嗯,他是对的。需要8个小时。
Well, he's right. It's gonna take eight hours.

440
00:29:04,846 --> 00:29:06,572
我能做到。滚吧。
I can do it. Let's get rolling.

441
00:29:06,675 --> 00:29:10,576
你想我们吗?是的,来吧。我还有工作要做。
You want us? Yeah, come on. I got work to do.

442
00:29:10,679 --> 00:29:13,165
我很忙。你能给我们演示一下吗?
I'm busy. Well, can you show us how it works?

443
00:29:13,268 --> 00:29:14,614
你会想出办法的。
You'll figure it out.

444
00:29:14,718 --> 00:29:16,996
对不起，旅馆不太好。
Sorry, the motel's not so great.

445
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:19,309
镐和铲子。
The Pick and Shovel.

446
00:29:19,412 --> 00:29:20,793
完美的名字。
Perfect name.

447
00:29:20,897 --> 00:29:23,589
因为这是你挖坟墓所需要的。
Because it's what you need to dig a grave.

448
00:29:23,692 --> 00:29:26,350
哈。让我想起了我们的新婚之夜。
Hah. Reminds me of our wedding night.

449
00:29:26,454 --> 00:29:27,904
嗯?
Huh?

450
00:29:28,007 --> 00:29:31,286
我爸给了我足够的钱让我带你去舞会。
My dad gave me enough money to take you to the prom.

451
00:29:31,390 --> 00:29:36,636
但我又想"见鬼，舞会午夜就结束了"但婚姻，却能天长地久。
But then I thought, "Heck, the prom ends at midnight, "but a marriage, that lasts forever.

452
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:38,328
“而且还便宜20美元。”
"And it's 20 bucks cheaper."

453
00:29:38,431 --> 00:29:40,848
你是在戴斯酒店度过的。
Which you spent on a Days Inn.

454
00:29:40,951 --> 00:29:43,712
哦，在我们度蜜月的时候。
Oh, on our honeymoon.Yeah.

455
00:29:43,816 --> 00:29:47,544
我很高兴我们都疯了。
Well, I'm glad we're being crazy.

456
00:29:47,647 --> 00:29:49,684
如果有必要，我会睡在车里。
I'd sleep in the car if I had to.

457
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:51,790
好吧，你可能不得不这么做。
Well, you may have to.

458
00:29:52,687 --> 00:29:54,344
我想这门锁不上。
I don't think this door locks.

459
00:29:54,447 --> 00:29:57,174
噢，开始了，杰瑞。哦，哦，哦，哦。
Oh, it's on, Jerry. Oh, oh, oh, oh.

460
00:30:00,868 --> 00:30:01,903
好吧。
All right.

461
00:30:03,353 --> 00:30:08,220
哦，你有…交叉手指，我们最后一个幸运数字是21。
Oh, you have the... Cross those fingers, our very last lucky number is 21.

462
00:30:08,323 --> 00:30:14,226
各位，这些数字，再来一次，是23 45 01 25 06和21。
Folks, those numbers, one more time, are 23, 45, 01, 25, 06 and 21.

463
00:30:14,329 --> 00:30:17,022
好了，伙计们，检查一下这些数字。我们祝你好运。
All right, folks, check those numbers. We wish you the best of luck.

464
00:30:17,125 --> 00:30:19,369
希望这是你的一周。
Hopefully this was your week.Okay.

465
00:30:24,201 --> 00:30:28,827
我们有八千张票要查。
Well, we got 8,000 tickets to check.

466
00:30:29,482 --> 00:30:30,690
让我们开始吧。
Let's get started.

467
00:30:30,794 --> 00:30:32,796
我们可能会看到日出。
We'll probably see sunrise.

468
00:30:56,026 --> 00:31:01,169
最后一个是三位数的冠军。
The last one is a three-number winner.

469
00:31:01,273 --> 00:31:03,102
哦,很好。
Oh, good.

470
00:31:03,931 --> 00:31:05,035
好吧。
Okay.

471
00:31:06,830 --> 00:31:10,661
所以我们押了16000。
So we bet 16,000.Mmm-hmm.

472
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:25,953
两个号码的中奖者会给我们免费的门票，所以如果我们把他们算作推动…这意味着我们…21043美元。
And the two number winners just gives us free tickets, so if we count those as a push... Which means we made... $21,043.

473
00:31:26,229 --> 00:31:30,543
哦……我觉得我们需要更多奥利奥。
Oh... I think we're gonna need more Oreos.

474
00:31:32,407 --> 00:31:36,549
是的,我们都…不,真见鬼。还留了一小块给你。
Yeah, we're all... No, heck. There's a little piece left there for you.

475
00:31:36,653 --> 00:31:40,657
不。你确定你不……不了,谢谢。
No.You sure you don't... No, thank you.

476
00:31:59,779 --> 00:32:03,542
他们只是说:“恭喜你。”嗯。
They just said, "Congratulations." Huh.

477
00:32:03,645 --> 00:32:05,026
当然了。
Of course they did.

478
00:32:05,130 --> 00:32:06,994
买票不违反规定。
It's not against the rules to buy tickets.

479
00:32:07,097 --> 00:32:10,618
我以为警报会响，他们就会对我大吼大叫。
I thought an alarm would go off and they'd start yelling at me.

480
00:32:10,721 --> 00:32:12,723
我也是。
So did I.

481
00:32:14,104 --> 00:32:17,004
你真以为只有我们知道吗?
Do you really think we're the only ones who know?

482
00:32:36,299 --> 00:32:40,544
为什么我们的厕所隔间上有超声波传感器?
Hey, why are there ultrasonic sensors on our toilet stalls?

483
00:32:40,648 --> 00:32:42,098
浴室空置网格。
Bathroom vacancy grid.

484
00:32:42,201 --> 00:32:44,928
我厌倦了走在那里看到每个隔间下都有脚。
I got tired of walking in there and seeing feet under every stall.

485
00:32:45,032 --> 00:32:49,968
所以，现在我知道当灯是绿色的时候，厕所是……不干净，但没人坐在上面。
So, now I know that when the light is green, the toilet is... Well, not clean, but nobody is sitting on it.

486
00:32:50,071 --> 00:32:51,980
我们应该在做研究项目。
We're supposed to be doing our research projects.

487
00:32:52,004 --> 00:32:53,004
我是。
I am.

488
00:32:53,074 --> 00:32:54,627
浴室灯吗?不。那是愚蠢的。
Bathroom lights? No. That'd be stupid.

489
00:32:54,731 --> 00:32:55,891
我正在做一个关于彩票的。
I'm doing one on the lottery.

490
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:58,493
啊。那就蠢多了。
Ah. That's way more stupid.

491
00:32:58,597 --> 00:33:03,429
它不是。我在评估强力球和超级百万的确切胜率。
It's not. I'm evaluating the exact odds of winning Power ball versus Mega Millions.

492
00:33:03,533 --> 00:33:06,432
好吧。是的,它是愚蠢的。无论什么。我还是会得到B。
Okay. Yeah, it's stupid. Whatever. I'll still get a B.

493
00:33:07,847 --> 00:33:09,056
这些是什么?
What are these?

494
00:33:09,159 --> 00:33:11,851
较小的州运动会。我需要它们作比较。
The smaller state games. I need them for comparison.

495
00:33:11,955 --> 00:33:14,302
甜的。残疾人专用隔间开着。
Sweet. The handicapped stall is open.

496
00:33:52,271 --> 00:33:53,824
杰瑞,靠边停车。
Jerry, pull over.

497
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:57,345
快点，靠边停车。我们离家只有一英里了。
Come on, pull over. We're only a mile from home.

498
00:33:57,449 --> 00:33:58,691
不。你hold不住?
No.You can't hold it?

499
00:33:58,795 --> 00:34:00,176
这并不是说。
It's not that.

500
00:34:01,418 --> 00:34:02,937
好吧。好吧。
Okay. Okay.

501
00:34:21,714 --> 00:34:23,337
马姬，这要花多长时间?
Marge, how long is this gonna take?

502
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:25,166
因为我真的得走了
'Cause I actually have to go.

503
00:34:27,030 --> 00:34:30,240
你有没有想过也许世界并没有与你擦肩而过?
Did you ever think maybe the world wasn't passing you by?

504
00:34:31,966 --> 00:34:34,072
也许你注定会在这里。
Maybe you were meant to be here.

505
00:34:35,521 --> 00:34:43,150
在工厂里工作，像你一样关心这些人，因为总有一天你可以帮助他们。
To work in the factory and to care about all these people the way you do, because the day would come when you could help them.

506
00:34:45,876 --> 00:34:47,775
你是什么意思?
What do you mean?

507
00:34:47,878 --> 00:34:51,468
你说我们赌得越多，胜算就越大。
Well, you said the more we bet, the better the odds.

508
00:35:06,518 --> 00:35:07,967
我确实说过。
I did say that.

509
00:35:14,077 --> 00:35:16,562
你想成立一家公司?
So you wanna start a corporation?

510
00:35:16,666 --> 00:35:18,081
把全城的人都招来。
Bring in the whole town.

511
00:35:18,185 --> 00:35:20,842
如果我们卖掉股份，我们就有更多的资本来投资。
If we sell shares, we'll have more capital to invest.

512
00:35:20,946 --> 00:35:22,982
要么做大，要么回家。
Go big or go home.

513
00:35:23,086 --> 00:35:25,537
那我们就和股东们分享利润。
Then we'll split the profits with the shareholders.

514
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:27,021
每个人都骑。
Everybody rides.

515
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:28,378
你能不能别那样说话?
Will you stop talking like that?

516
00:35:28,402 --> 00:35:30,335
对不起。我真的很喜欢。
Sorry. I'm just really into it.

517
00:35:30,438 --> 00:35:31,819
她真的很喜欢。
She's really into it.

518
00:35:31,922 --> 00:35:33,269
因为她知道这行得通。
Because she knows it'll work.

519
00:35:33,372 --> 00:35:34,477
房子总是赢家。
House always wins.

520
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:35,581
阻止它。
Stop it.

521
00:35:36,824 --> 00:35:38,526
你真的认为人们会参与进来吗?
You really think people will come in on this?

522
00:35:38,550 --> 00:35:39,827
是的。你所做的。
Yup. You did.

523
00:35:39,930 --> 00:35:42,250
是啊，但我是个绝望的鳏夫，没有任何生活目标。
Yeah, but I'm a depressed widower with nothing to live for.

524
00:35:42,278 --> 00:35:44,935
那你想买更多的股票?是的!
You wanna buy more shares, then? Yes!

525
00:35:45,867 --> 00:35:47,559
就是这样。
And that about does it.

526
00:35:47,662 --> 00:35:49,181
有什么问题吗?
Any questions?

527
00:35:49,285 --> 00:35:53,047
那么，GS投资策略公司?这是正确的。
So, uh, GS Investment Strategies? That's right.

528
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:55,739
我们有营业执照，什么都有。
We've got a business license and everything.

529
00:35:55,843 --> 00:35:56,913
不是个好名字。
Not much of a name.

530
00:35:57,016 --> 00:35:58,363
好吧，不用担心名字。
Well, don't worry about the name.

531
00:35:58,466 --> 00:35:59,946
你需要在某个地方加上“彩票”。
You need "lottery" in there somewhere.

532
00:36:00,019 --> 00:36:01,435
名字不重要。
Well, the name's not important.

533
00:36:01,538 --> 00:36:05,301
如果你想推销你的想法，那就是。我上了一门市场营销的课。
It is if you wanna sell the idea. I took a class on marketing.

534
00:36:05,404 --> 00:36:10,651
好吧，这个想法很畅销。你以500美元的价格买一股股票，然后获利。
Well, the idea sells itself. You buy a share for $500 and you make a profit.

535
00:36:10,754 --> 00:36:12,687
就是这么简单。你有商标吗?
It's that simple. Do you have a logo?

536
00:36:12,791 --> 00:36:14,482
不需要logo。商标的帮助。
Don't need a logo. Logos help.

537
00:36:14,586 --> 00:36:16,484
我有一头猪在拖拉机上。
I have a pig on a tractor.

538
00:36:17,968 --> 00:36:21,972
是的。好吧，听着，你们都认识我很多年了。
Yeah. Okay, look, you all have known me for years.

539
00:36:22,076 --> 00:36:25,044
这招会管用的，对大家都有帮助。
This will work, and it'll help everybody.

540
00:36:25,148 --> 00:36:30,429
如果我们想加入，但我们拖欠了账单，没钱分一杯羹怎么办?
What if we want in, but we're behind on our bills, and don't have enough for a share?

541
00:36:30,533 --> 00:36:32,638
你们接受其他付款方式吗?
Do you accept other forms of payment?

542
00:36:33,018 --> 00:36:34,088
像什么?
Like what?

543
00:36:47,550 --> 00:36:48,620
等等,等等,等等。
Wait, wait, wait.

544
00:36:48,723 --> 00:36:50,104
都在这里。
Got it all right here.

545
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:51,864
哦,我们在。
Oh, we're in.

546
00:36:51,968 --> 00:36:54,142
我从没做过这种犯罪的事。
I've never done anything criminal like this.

547
00:36:54,246 --> 00:36:56,248
不，雪莉，这不是犯罪
No, Shirley, it's not criminal.

548
00:36:56,352 --> 00:37:00,045
我们要为所有赢来的钱缴税，报销所有费用。
We're gonna pay taxes on all the winnings and claim expenses.

549
00:37:00,148 --> 00:37:02,358
杰瑞把一切都安排好了。
Jerry's got it all worked out.

550
00:37:02,461 --> 00:37:05,533
你妈妈和我要去做生意了。
Your mother and I are going into business.

551
00:37:05,637 --> 00:37:08,295
你是在卖太妃糖什么的吗?
Are you selling her toffee or something?

552
00:37:08,398 --> 00:37:11,298
不。我们要去买彩票。
No. We're gonna play the lottery.

553
00:37:11,401 --> 00:37:14,266
500美元一份，好的。
It's 500 a share.Okay.

554
00:37:14,370 --> 00:37:16,820
噢,是吗?好吧?你不想知道细节吗?
Oh, yeah? Okay? You don't wanna know details?

555
00:37:16,924 --> 00:37:19,064
不不不，我很好。听起来很不错。
No, no, no, I'm good. It sounds great.

556
00:37:19,167 --> 00:37:20,967
你可以在前三部《爸爸，爸爸》中看到。
You can see in the first three plays Dad, Dad.

557
00:37:20,997 --> 00:37:22,250
我们增加了利润。
That we've increased our profit.

558
00:37:22,274 --> 00:37:24,034
它不适合我。
It's just not for me.

559
00:37:24,138 --> 00:37:26,865
我就是不明白。这只是数学。
I just don't understand this. It's just math.

560
00:37:26,968 --> 00:37:28,798
总是数学问题。
It's always just math.

561
00:37:28,901 --> 00:37:35,425
这就像在硬币中分类，寻找水牛硬币，因为你已经计算过了，每七个卷中就有一个?
It's like sorting through coins, looking for buffalo nickels, because you had calculated there was, what, one in every seven rolls or something?

562
00:37:35,529 --> 00:37:37,634
是的。我们赚了600美元。
Yeah. We made $600.

563
00:37:37,738 --> 00:37:42,018
整整一个月，我们每个周末都在整理硬币。我12岁的时候。
We sorted through coins every weekend for a month. I was 12.

564
00:37:42,121 --> 00:37:43,364
它是乐趣。
It was fun.

565
00:37:45,055 --> 00:37:48,335
要是能扔个足球什么的就好了。
It would have been nice to just throw the football or something.

566
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:55,756
看,我…嘿,道格?
Look, I'm... Hey, Doug?

567
00:37:55,859 --> 00:37:58,079
道格，波特家的谷仓停电了他们想让你去看看。
Doug, the Porters lost power in their barn and they want you to come take a look.

568
00:37:58,103 --> 00:37:59,303
好吧。我马上就来。
All right. I'll be right there.

569
00:37:59,346 --> 00:38:01,762
好吧。我要go.Okay。是的。
Okay. I gotta go.Okay. Yup.

570
00:38:07,319 --> 00:38:09,252
我会帮你的，爷爷。
I'll be in your business, Pop Pop.

571
00:38:11,116 --> 00:38:13,774
你对商标印象如何?好。
How are you at logos? Good.

572
00:38:13,877 --> 00:38:15,362
好吧，过来给爷爷看。
Well, come here and show Pop Pop.

573
00:38:16,466 --> 00:38:17,502
在这里。
Here.

574
00:38:20,401 --> 00:38:22,817
我给你一些纸。
Let me give you some paper.

575
00:38:22,921 --> 00:38:28,478
你给我看看你能为爷爷的公司画个logo。
And you show me what you can do about drawing a logo for Pop Pop's business.

576
00:38:28,582 --> 00:38:31,205
如果你想继续，就按你的按钮。
If you wanna get that going, push your button.

577
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:32,689
在这里。按下按钮。
Right there. Push the button.

578
00:38:43,942 --> 00:38:46,600
比尔?——嘿,杰里。嘿,玛姬。
Bill?- Hey, Jerry. Hey, Marge.

579
00:38:46,703 --> 00:38:48,395
嗨。
Hi.

580
00:38:48,498 --> 00:38:52,882
嘿，如果我们再这样，我要收你用微波炉的钱。
Hey, uh, if we're gonna do this again, I'm gonna need to charge you for using the microwave.

581
00:38:54,262 --> 00:38:57,335
我们赌4万。
We are betting 40,000.

582
00:38:58,059 --> 00:38:59,198
你们是毒贩吗?
You guys drug dealers?

583
00:38:59,302 --> 00:39:02,857
不。我们是专业的彩票玩家。
No. We're professional lottery players.

584
00:39:02,961 --> 00:39:04,411
我不认为这是一件事。
I don't think that's a thing.

585
00:39:04,514 --> 00:39:06,067
这是现在。
It is now.

586
00:39:06,171 --> 00:39:14,323
听着，虽然我很想知道你能不能在那后面站那么久而不摔断髋骨，但你不可能在打烊前买那么多票。
Listen, as much as I'd like to see if you can stand behind that thing for that long without breaking a hip, there's no way you can buy that many tickets before closing time.

587
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:16,077
你们能晚一点营业吗?
Can you stay open later?

588
00:39:16,181 --> 00:39:17,527
哦，恐怕不行。
Oh, I'm afraid not.

589
00:39:19,667 --> 00:39:22,049
我现在正经历婚姻创伤。
I'm undergoing some marital trauma at the moment.

590
00:39:22,152 --> 00:39:26,881
哦。说实话，今晚要和我的朋友们喝酒庆祝。
Oh.Well, truth be told, tonight is a drinking celebration with my buddies.

591
00:39:26,985 --> 00:39:33,785
诚然，我们会在外面做，在停车场，但是，我不能让顾客进来。
Now, admittedly we do it out there, in the parking lot, but, uh, I just can't have customers in here.

592
00:39:33,888 --> 00:39:35,407
这是一个责任。
It's a liability.

593
00:39:37,064 --> 00:39:41,137
嗯…如果我们不是顾客呢?
Well... What if we weren't customers?

594
00:39:48,662 --> 00:39:50,560
我不知道你在说什么。
I have no idea what you're talking about.

595
00:39:51,458 --> 00:39:54,668
如果我们是搭档呢?
What if we were partners?

596
00:39:54,771 --> 00:40:01,537
比尔，我来给你介绍一下GS投资策略公司。
Bill, I'd like to introduce you to GS Investment Strategies.

597
00:40:03,849 --> 00:40:05,472
我在。我能进来吗?
I'm in. Can I be in?

598
00:40:08,785 --> 00:40:12,479
我是股东，如果你们愿意，我完全可以让你们加入。
So I'm a shareholder, and I could totally get you guys in if you want.

599
00:40:12,582 --> 00:40:19,969
所以，这是一个WinFall，所以当数字…好吧，你是投资者……好吧，假设你有几百美元。
So, it's a WinFall, so when the numbers... Okay, you're an investor... Okay, let's say you've got several hundred dollars.

600
00:40:20,072 --> 00:40:25,353
还有这些彩票号码。如果他们不打，你就赢了。
Then there is these lottery numbers. If they don't hit, you win.

601
00:40:26,147 --> 00:40:28,805
你在吗?你有钱吗?
You in? You got any money?

602
00:40:29,772 --> 00:40:31,739
我想我们讲完了。
I believe we are done.

603
00:40:32,568 --> 00:40:34,432
嘿，我还有两个股东。
Hey, I got two more shareholders.

604
00:40:34,535 --> 00:40:37,655
他们中肯定有人去抢他父母的房子，但他肯定在里面。
One of them's got to rob his parents' house real quick, but he's definitely in.

605
00:40:38,850 --> 00:40:41,197
又多了500张票。
That's 500 more tickets.Yup.

606
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:42,474
好吧。
All right.

607
00:40:42,578 --> 00:40:44,269
你要来一口吗?
You want a bong hit real quick?

608
00:40:44,372 --> 00:40:47,168
我不知道那是什么。——玛姬?
I don't know what that is.- Marge?

609
00:40:47,272 --> 00:40:50,378
不,谢谢,比尔。好吧。噢!
No thanks, Bill. All right. Ow!

610
00:40:55,107 --> 00:41:03,702
我们的下一个数字是46…数24…今天最后一个数字是23。
Our next number is 46... Number 24... And our very last number for today is number 23.

611
00:41:03,806 --> 00:41:10,329
所以，再来一次，这些数字是05、21、39、46、24、23……好了，开始。
So, one more time, those numbers are 05, 21, 39, 46, 24, 23... Okay, here we go.

612
00:41:10,433 --> 00:41:13,332
不会再被烟烫伤了吧?是的。
No more cigarette burns, huh? Yeah.

613
00:41:17,751 --> 00:41:27,105
嗯…我想我们可以喝点美味的汽车旅馆咖啡开始了。
Well... I guess we fire up some of that delicious motel coffee and get started.

614
00:41:27,208 --> 00:41:28,762
或者可以等到明天早上。
Or it could wait till morning.

615
00:41:29,590 --> 00:41:30,695
明天好吗?
Tomorrow?

616
00:41:45,848 --> 00:41:47,263
哦。
Oh.

617
00:41:49,161 --> 00:41:50,611
嗯。
Hmm.

618
00:41:58,032 --> 00:41:59,517
彩票吗?
The lottery?

619
00:41:59,620 --> 00:42:01,242
彩票中奖者的点击率很高。
Lottery winners get a lot of clicks.

620
00:42:01,346 --> 00:42:03,348
我不做点击。我做新闻。
I don't do clicks. I do news.

621
00:42:03,451 --> 00:42:06,454
你没看到这些空隔间吗?
Do you not see all these empty cubicles?

622
00:42:07,352 --> 00:42:09,527
随便找点东西。
Just poke around for something.

623
00:42:10,217 --> 00:42:13,945
给我找个头条放到重点报道的版面上。
Find me a headline that I can throw in the Spotlight section.

624
00:42:21,366 --> 00:42:24,058
嗯。
Hmm.

625
00:42:24,162 --> 00:42:28,822
这个床垫的好处是，我们都滚到中间去。
Oh, nice thing about this mattress is, we both roll to the center.

626
00:42:31,410 --> 00:42:33,930
我想就算我试了也逃不出去。
I don't think I can get out if I tried.

627
00:42:34,034 --> 00:42:35,656
我们还有时间。
Well, we have time.

628
00:42:37,382 --> 00:42:39,695
什么?到底是什么?
What? What the heck?

629
00:42:39,798 --> 00:42:41,973
嘿，嘿，好了，好了。
Hey, hey, all right, all right.

630
00:42:43,561 --> 00:42:45,873
我走错房间了。我走错房间了。
Got the wrong room. Got the wrong room.

631
00:42:45,977 --> 00:42:47,737
它来了!是什么?
It came in! What did?

632
00:42:47,841 --> 00:42:51,189
彩票将商店售出的所有奖金的总数寄给顾客。
The lottery sends a tally of all the winnings sold by the store.

633
00:42:51,292 --> 00:42:54,744
WinFall彩票赢得了8.2万美元。
WinFall tickets won $82,000.

634
00:42:56,228 --> 00:42:59,473
你在你的店里卖了多少WinFall的票?
And how many WinFall tickets did you sell at your store?

635
00:42:59,577 --> 00:43:02,165
就是你的，再加六个。是的!
Just yours, plus six more. Yes!

636
00:43:02,269 --> 00:43:03,960
给我。但这些都没有胜出。
To me. But those didn't win.

637
00:43:05,203 --> 00:43:06,376
我们增加了一倍。我们增加了一倍。
We doubled it. We doubled it.

638
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:08,275
我们增加了一倍!
We doubled it!

639
00:43:08,378 --> 00:43:09,378
我们增加了一倍!
We doubled it!

640
00:43:10,553 --> 00:43:11,968
我们增加了一倍!
We doubled it!

641
00:43:54,321 --> 00:43:56,806
哇!
Whoo!

642
00:44:06,436 --> 00:44:08,059
这是史蒂夫。
It's Steve.

643
00:44:08,162 --> 00:44:09,162
嗨,史蒂夫。
Hey, Steve.

644
00:44:09,232 --> 00:44:10,717
嘿,杰瑞。
Hey, Jerry.

645
00:44:10,820 --> 00:44:14,306
我只是想看看我们进展如何。嗯，你知道，好奇。
I was just checking to see how we did. Um, you know, curious.

646
00:44:14,410 --> 00:44:17,827
我会发出一份正式的股东报告。
I will be sending out an official shareholder report.

647
00:44:17,931 --> 00:44:22,729
对，对，对，但你知道…他想知道。你觉得呢?
Yeah, yeah, right, right, but you know... He wants to know. What do you think?

648
00:44:26,077 --> 00:44:28,942
我们把它翻倍了。
Well, we doubled it.

649
00:44:29,045 --> 00:44:30,045
我们增加了一倍!
We doubled it!

650
00:44:40,850 --> 00:44:42,024
嘘。
Shh.

651
00:45:06,324 --> 00:45:11,398
这不可能是真的。我也不相信，但我在画画的时候做了模拟，结果是对的。
This can't be real. I didn't believe it either, but I've been running simulations during the drawings, and it's right.

652
00:45:11,501 --> 00:45:14,056
如果你赌至少1万美元，赔率会向买家倾斜。
If you bet at least 10 grand, the odds tilt towards the buyer.

653
00:45:14,159 --> 00:45:16,379
你能从你爸爸那里弄到钱吗?我没问他要什么。
Can you get money from your dad? I'm not asking him for shit.

654
00:45:16,403 --> 00:45:18,854
为什么不呢?他的名字写在一栋建筑上。我想他能负担得起。
Why not? His name is on a building. I think he can afford it.

655
00:45:18,957 --> 00:45:20,407
因为这是我的。
Because this is mine.

656
00:45:20,510 --> 00:45:21,788
你有一万美元吗?不。
Do you have 10 grand? No.

657
00:45:23,859 --> 00:45:25,274
我有一个宿舍。
I have a dorm.

658
00:45:25,377 --> 00:45:28,242
也就是每人吃一片披萨。一片。谢谢你！
Okay, that is one slice of pizza per person. One slice. Thank you.

659
00:45:28,346 --> 00:45:30,866
嘿，如果你捐了钱，就拿一块。
Hey, only take a piece if you contributed to the fund.

660
00:45:30,969 --> 00:45:35,733
你们在哈佛学到的第一件事就是你们在这里是为了你们的未来。
The first thing you learn at Harvard is that you're here for your future.

661
00:45:36,216 --> 00:45:37,596
对吧?
Right?

662
00:45:37,700 --> 00:45:41,117
你学到的第二件事是……那都是扯淡。
Second thing you learn... Is that's all bullshit.

663
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:44,431
没有未来。
There is no future.

664
00:45:44,534 --> 00:45:48,469
现在就等着你去拿。
There is just now waiting for you to take it.

665
00:45:48,573 --> 00:45:52,439
我发现彩票有个缺陷。
I found a flaw in the lottery.

666
00:45:52,542 --> 00:45:58,307
好吧?每次都能赢的方法因为没人知道我做了什么。
Okay? A way to beat the game every time because nobody at the lottery figured out what I did.

667
00:45:58,410 --> 00:46:01,275
但只有在你能下大赌注的情况下，它才管用。
But it only works if you can bet big.

668
00:46:01,379 --> 00:46:08,904
所以，告诉你的父母你要交新的实验费，或者需要书，或者得了性病。
So, tell your parents that you have new lab fees, or need books, or got an STD.

669
00:46:10,664 --> 00:46:16,290
不惜一切代价，因为如果我们成功了，我们就是传奇!
Whatever it takes, because if we pull this off, then we are legends!

670
00:46:19,535 --> 00:46:25,506
还有，我需要你们填300张彩票单，这样我们就不会重复下注了。
Also, I'm gonna need you all to fill out about 300 lottery slips, so we don't bet duplicates.

671
00:46:25,610 --> 00:46:27,198
给你。那是你的。
Here you go. That's for you.

672
00:46:28,199 --> 00:46:29,234
谢谢你！
Thank you.

673
00:46:32,479 --> 00:46:34,101
你什么都没填吗?
You're not filling any out?

674
00:46:34,205 --> 00:46:36,103
不。我负责。
No. I'm in charge.

675
00:46:39,072 --> 00:46:41,695
好吧，告诉我。你想重新装修吗?
Okay, talk to me. So you wanna renovate it?

676
00:46:41,799 --> 00:46:44,456
是的。所有的股东都出资。
Yup. All the shareholders are chipping in.

677
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:46,251
我们要重新举办爵士音乐节。
We're bringing back the jazz festival.

678
00:46:46,355 --> 00:46:49,496
最好的音乐是你在旅途中谱写的音乐。
The best music is the music you make up as you go along.

679
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:52,775
我只是很难过普林斯不在的时候我们没能拥有它。
Ah, I'm just sad we couldn't have had it when Prince was around.

680
00:46:52,879 --> 00:46:54,363
他就不会来了，霍华德
He wouldn't have come, Howard.

681
00:46:54,466 --> 00:46:55,882
我们永远不会知道。
We'll never know.

682
00:46:55,985 --> 00:46:58,308
你们确定要这么花你们的钱吗?
You guys are sure this is what you wanna do with your money?

683
00:46:58,332 --> 00:46:59,723
你不想投资吗?
You don't wanna invest it somewhere?

684
00:46:59,747 --> 00:47:02,026
我们在某个地方投资。
We are investing it somewhere.

685
00:47:05,132 --> 00:47:06,132
好吧。
All right.

686
00:47:06,927 --> 00:47:08,687
我来帮你。好吧。
I'll give you a hand. All right.

687
00:47:08,791 --> 00:47:11,276
道格，把它放在上面。好吧。
Doug, put it on top there.Yup. All right.

688
00:47:12,588 --> 00:47:14,762
谢谢你！
Thank you.

689
00:47:15,315 --> 00:47:16,350
哇。
Wow.

690
00:47:17,489 --> 00:47:18,697
你为什么留着这些?
Why do you keep all these?

691
00:47:18,974 --> 00:47:20,216
美国国税局。
The IRS.

692
00:47:21,114 --> 00:47:25,394
当我们被审计时，我们需要一份所有遗失彩票的书面记录。
When we get audited, we'll need a paper trail of all the losing tickets we bought.

693
00:47:25,497 --> 00:47:27,120
你觉得你会被审核吗?
Think you're gonna get audited?

694
00:47:27,223 --> 00:47:28,397
哦,是的。
Oh, yeah.

695
00:47:29,156 --> 00:47:30,606
耶稣。
Jesus.

696
00:47:30,709 --> 00:47:34,610
你知道吗，你的团队雇我来修理露天剧场。六个月的工作。
You know, your group hired me to fix the amphitheater. Six-month job.

697
00:47:34,713 --> 00:47:37,751
哦。你觉得怎么样?
Oh. How about that?

698
00:47:37,855 --> 00:47:39,857
是啊，怎么样?
Yeah, how about that?

699
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:43,826
那你可以考虑帮我一把。
Well, you may wanna consider chipping in on that.

700
00:47:44,137 --> 00:47:45,552
什么?
What?

701
00:47:45,655 --> 00:47:48,831
好吧，你有一份。
Well, you have a share.

702
00:47:50,281 --> 00:47:51,869
你从一开始就做到了。
You did, from the start.

703
00:47:54,078 --> 00:47:55,148
爸爸……
Dad...

704
00:47:57,426 --> 00:47:58,772
你不用这么做的。
You didn't have to do that.

705
00:47:58,876 --> 00:48:01,188
没有你我可不想数硬币。
Oh, I didn't wanna count nickels without you.

706
00:48:06,435 --> 00:48:10,577
我跟你说，多蒂把书店办得很好。
I'm telling you, Dottie has done such a great job with this bookstore.

707
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:13,131
是的。里昂正在装修酒店。
Yeah. You know, Leon is renovating the hotel.

708
00:48:13,235 --> 00:48:18,654
霍华德给了他一个协议，但他的佣金是他和雪莉可以随时使用热水浴缸。
Howard got him a deal on it, but his commission is that he and Shirley get to use the hot tub whenever they want.

709
00:48:18,757 --> 00:48:20,552
里昂会后悔的。
Leon will regret that.

710
00:48:20,656 --> 00:48:21,968
你不是在开玩笑。
You are not kidding.

711
00:48:22,071 --> 00:48:23,590
你好,大家好。——哦,嘿!
Hello, hello, everybody.- Oh, hey!

712
00:48:27,249 --> 00:48:31,632
好吧。好吧,去吧……来吧，坐下。
All right. Well, go ahead... Go on, sit on down.

713
00:48:31,736 --> 00:48:41,332
嗯…嗯…嗯…听着，首先，我可以说我们做得很好。
Uh... Uh... Well... Look, first off, I can say that we're doing pretty darn well.

714
00:48:41,435 --> 00:48:43,161
是的。
Yes.

715
00:48:43,265 --> 00:48:48,856
是的。但你可能已经通过阅读你的股东报告知道了……我的打不开。
Yeah. But you probably already know that by reading your shareholder report... I can't get mine to open.

716
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:50,341
哦，你有Word吗?
Oh, do you have Word?

717
00:48:50,444 --> 00:48:52,170
我想我有Windows。
I have Windows, I think.

718
00:48:52,274 --> 00:48:54,138
我给你印一份，雪莉。
I'll print you one, Shirley.

719
00:48:54,241 --> 00:48:55,241
噢,谢谢你。
Oh, thank you.

720
00:48:55,277 --> 00:49:03,630
Anyhoo……你可能已经想到了，我们要把大部分资金用于赌博。
Anyhoo... As you might have imagined it, we're gonna use the majority of our capital for betting.

721
00:49:03,733 --> 00:49:04,872
是的。
Yeah.

722
00:49:04,976 --> 00:49:10,844
但你可以获得一些红利。
But there are dividends that you can access.

723
00:49:10,948 --> 00:49:16,056
正确的。所以，我知道很多人都想看到爵士音乐节回归。
Right. So, I know a lot of people would like to see the jazz festival come back.

724
00:49:17,747 --> 00:49:21,889
而且，老弗兰克肯定会用一辆他不会掉下去的邮车。
And, Old Frank can sure use a mail truck he doesn't fall out of.

725
00:49:23,615 --> 00:49:31,278
那么，现在来说说利润比率。我们……是的,拉杰?这里没有吃的吗?
Uh, so, now on to the profit ratios. We... Yes, Raj? Is there not food at this thing?

726
00:49:31,382 --> 00:49:35,041
不。不。这是股东大会。这不是派对。
No. No. This is a shareholder meeting. It's not a party.

727
00:49:35,144 --> 00:49:38,458
那你为什么在我们吃东西的时候吃?
Then why did you have it at - 00, when we all eat?

728
00:49:39,942 --> 00:49:46,500
好吧，你们都可以去吃饭，但是…不，那你就不会知道那些数字了。
Well, you're welcome to all go to the diner, but... No, then you're not gonna learn about the numbers.

729
00:49:48,054 --> 00:49:50,056
那么，下一步怎么办?
So, what's the next play?

730
00:49:50,159 --> 00:49:51,954
312000张门票。
312,000 tickets.

731
00:49:52,058 --> 00:49:54,232
这是600000美元。-是的。
That's $600,000.- Yeah.

732
00:49:54,336 --> 00:49:57,822
我们在一场赌局下了50万?
We're betting half a million in one play?

733
00:49:57,925 --> 00:49:59,548
钱是最容易的部分。
Oh, the money is the easy part.

734
00:49:59,651 --> 00:50:00,963
是吗?是的。
Is it? Yeah.

735
00:50:01,067 --> 00:50:05,795
四天的赌博，两台机器，一天12个小时。
It'll take four days of betting, two machines, 12 hours a day.

736
00:50:05,899 --> 00:50:08,074
那你为什么不按正常金额下注呢?
Then why don't you just bet the normal amount?

737
00:50:08,177 --> 00:50:09,247
数学。
Math.

738
00:50:09,351 --> 00:50:10,559
这是牛顿定律。
It's Newton's law.

739
00:50:10,662 --> 00:50:13,734
如果你推什么东西，它就会推回来。
If you push against something, it's gonna push back.

740
00:50:13,838 --> 00:50:15,460
我们发现了一个缺陷。
And we discovered a flaw.

741
00:50:15,564 --> 00:50:20,155
但是通过使用它，我们引入了一个变量来改变它。
But by using it, we've introduced a variable that changes it.

742
00:50:20,258 --> 00:50:23,192
我们也不知道这场比赛会持续多久。
And we don't know how long this game is gonna last.

743
00:50:23,296 --> 00:50:26,644
那我们就得趁现在尽可能多赚钱。
Then we need to make as much money as we can, while we can.

744
00:50:26,747 --> 00:50:31,062
让节日开始吧，在它推迟之前完成重建。
Get the festival going, and finish rebuilding before it pushes back.

745
00:50:31,166 --> 00:50:32,236
嗯。
Mmm-hmm.

746
00:50:32,339 --> 00:50:37,724
我从彩票公司订购了第二台机器，但他们说每个地方只能买一台，所以我想，“如果我有第二家店呢?”
I ordered a second machine from the lottery, but they said you're only allowed one per location, so I was like, "Well, what if I have a second store?"

747
00:50:37,827 --> 00:50:40,830
他们会问:“地址是什么?”我当时想:“哦哦。这是我的错误。”
They're like, "What's the address?" I was like, "Uh-oh. There's my mistake."

748
00:50:40,934 --> 00:50:43,143
这就是我的朋友Darryl发挥作用的地方。
And that's where my buddy, Darryl, comes in.

749
00:50:43,247 --> 00:50:46,077
我们会多给他一份，但给你。
And, uh, we're gonna give him an extra share, but here you are.

750
00:50:46,181 --> 00:50:50,012
你可以一天24小时打印，外加无限的馅饼。
You can print out 24 hours a day, plus unlimited pie.

751
00:50:53,843 --> 00:50:55,052
看看这个。
Look at this.

752
00:50:55,707 --> 00:50:56,812
这是什么?
What's this?

753
00:50:56,915 --> 00:50:58,538
从我在总检察长办公室的线人那里得到的。
From my source at the AG's office.

754
00:50:58,641 --> 00:51:03,232
现在，彩票公司必须每年五次，公开那些索赔超过5万美元的玩家。
Now, the lottery has to disclose players who claim more than 50 grand, five times a year.

755
00:51:03,336 --> 00:51:12,690
有时候赢家只是幌子，帮欠孩子抚养费的人，或者有搜查令的人兑现票，但看看这家伙。每三周大赢一次。
Sometimes the winners are fronts, you know, cashing tickets for people who owe child support, or have a warrant, but look at this guy. Wins big every three weeks.

756
00:51:12,793 --> 00:51:15,348
住在密歇根。一个退休的工厂工人。
Lives in Michigan. A retired factory worker.

757
00:51:15,451 --> 00:51:16,625
没有犯罪记录。
No criminal record.

758
00:51:16,728 --> 00:51:18,523
他赢了这么多?是的。
He's won this much? Yeah.

759
00:51:18,627 --> 00:51:22,803
谁每个月开10个小时的车去不同的州买彩票?
Who drives 10 hours every month to play the lottery in a different state?

760
00:51:22,907 --> 00:51:24,909
这说不通啊对
Yeah, that doesn't make any sense.Right.

761
00:51:44,791 --> 00:51:46,241
失败者!
Loser!

762
00:51:53,800 --> 00:51:55,629
那个女人刚抢了你的东西吗?
Did that woman just rob you?

763
00:51:55,733 --> 00:51:56,941
这是我的妻子。
That's my wife.

764
00:51:58,563 --> 00:51:59,564
哇。
Wow.

765
00:52:00,669 --> 00:52:02,636
嗯，她看起来很精神。
Well, she certainly seems spirited.

766
00:52:02,740 --> 00:52:04,362
是啊，她是个好斗的人。
Yeah, she's a spitfire.

767
00:52:04,466 --> 00:52:09,240
不，她只是因为我提出离婚而生气，她觉得我根本负担不起。
No, she's just pissed off 'cause I filed for divorce, and she didn't ever think I'd be able to afford it.

768
00:52:09,264 --> 00:52:10,782
嗯。
Huh.

769
00:52:10,886 --> 00:52:13,406
看来钱花得很值。
Looks like money well spent.Yeah.

770
00:52:13,509 --> 00:52:17,479
自从史蒂利·丹停止巡演之后就没什么魔力了。
Kind of lost the magic ever since Steely Dan stopped touring.

771
00:52:20,275 --> 00:52:23,519
你知道的…我需要找一个像你这样的人。
You know... I need to find someone like you.

772
00:52:25,003 --> 00:52:27,972
只有年轻。是的，一开始很好。
Only younger. Yeah, that started off great.

773
00:52:28,075 --> 00:52:32,494
不，我是说，你懂的，就是一个还能生育的人。
No, I mean, you know, just someone that's still fertile.

774
00:52:32,597 --> 00:52:34,634
他们的子宫可以孕育婴儿。
And their womb can have babies.

775
00:52:34,737 --> 00:52:35,945
你不擅长这个。
You're not good at this.

776
00:52:36,049 --> 00:52:37,982
哦，我真的没有。你能帮我吗?
Oh, I'm really not. Can you help me?

777
00:52:38,810 --> 00:52:46,611
我妈妈以前常说，“亲几只青蛙，然后当你找到你的王子，”你会发现青蛙更好，因为它们能让你笑。“
Well, my mother used to say, "Kiss a few frogs, then when you find your prince, "you'll realize that the frogs are better, 'cause they make you laugh."

778
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:51,444
嘲笑你算吗?
Does laughing at you count?

779
00:52:51,547 --> 00:52:53,584
比尔，你需要一只新的青蛙。
Bill, you need a new frog.

780
00:52:53,687 --> 00:52:55,172
我需要一只新的青蛙。
I need a new frog.

781
00:52:55,655 --> 00:52:58,451
50000美元。
$50,000.

782
00:53:00,522 --> 00:53:02,834
欢迎来到现在，贱人们。
Welcome to the now, bitches.

783
00:53:02,938 --> 00:53:08,909
我们会赚很多钱，但这需要时间，汗水和激情，好吗?
We are going to make a shitload of money, but it's going to take time, and sweat, and passion, okay?

784
00:53:09,013 --> 00:53:11,981
每个人都要填两叠单子。
So, everybody fill out two stacks of slips.

785
00:53:12,085 --> 00:53:14,915
我们需要在未来三周内引进两万五千人。
We need to get 25,000 in in the next three weeks.

786
00:53:22,647 --> 00:53:24,097
错了什么吗?
Something wrong?

787
00:53:24,201 --> 00:53:25,547
另一组。
There's another group.

788
00:53:25,823 --> 00:53:26,858
什么?
What?

789
00:53:26,962 --> 00:53:28,446
支付本应更高。
The payout should have been bigger.

790
00:53:28,550 --> 00:53:33,037
唯一说得通的是又有一群人吃了大麻，所以我查了每家店的销售情况。
The only thing that makes sense is another group eating into the pot, so I checked sales at every store.

791
00:53:33,140 --> 00:53:36,282
这是公共信息?不，我黑进了州彩票。
That's public information? No, I hacked the state lottery.

792
00:53:36,765 --> 00:53:37,765
好了。
Nice.

793
00:53:38,698 --> 00:53:39,837
等待。这是我的笔记本。
Wait. That's my laptop.

794
00:53:39,940 --> 00:53:41,711
是的。你应该在这之后销毁硬盘。
Yeah. You should destroy your hard drive after this.

795
00:53:41,735 --> 00:53:44,497
Dude.Whatever。它工作。
Dude.Whatever. It worked.

796
00:53:44,600 --> 00:53:47,224
看看桑德兰的奖金，只有两个地方。
Look at the winnings in Sunderland, from only two locations.

797
00:53:47,327 --> 00:53:51,435
两个位置。他们必须买一个星期的票才能得到这样的数字。
Two locations. They'd have to buy tickets for a week to get those kind of numbers.

798
00:53:53,540 --> 00:53:55,093
他们现在就在那里。
They're there right now.

799
00:54:13,905 --> 00:54:17,702
嘿。我今晚很早就做完了。
Hey. I finished early tonight.

800
00:54:18,116 --> 00:54:19,601
什么事那么匆忙?
What's the rush?

801
00:54:19,704 --> 00:54:26,608
哦……你不会以为我会忘记我们的纪念日吧?
Oh... You didn't think I'd forget our anniversary, did you?

802
00:54:26,711 --> 00:54:31,992
你刚从冷藏箱里拿出来的。嗯,是的。
Oh, you just got that out of the cooler. Well, yeah.

803
00:54:32,096 --> 00:54:35,686
但我今早把它藏在哟呼后面了这样就没人能拿到它了。
But I hid it behind the Yoo-hoo this morning so that nobody would get it.

804
00:54:41,036 --> 00:54:42,348
哇!
Whoo!

805
00:54:43,452 --> 00:54:44,350
哇。
Wow.

806
00:54:44,453 --> 00:54:46,490
你知道这样做很好。
You know it's good when it does that.

807
00:54:48,388 --> 00:54:50,494
美丽的中国塑料。
Beautiful plastic china.

808
00:54:51,805 --> 00:54:53,186
给你。
Here you go.

809
00:54:54,739 --> 00:54:57,086
敬46年。
Here's to 46 more years.

810
00:54:58,674 --> 00:55:00,158
欢呼。
Cheers.

811
00:55:02,299 --> 00:55:03,369
哦。
Ooh.

812
00:55:09,236 --> 00:55:12,412
我想我还欠你一个舞会之夜。
I think I still owe you a prom night.

813
00:55:28,808 --> 00:55:31,397
我16岁的时候还容易些。
This was easier when I was 16.

814
00:55:33,019 --> 00:55:35,608
你现在更漂亮了。
You're even more beautiful now.

815
00:55:35,711 --> 00:55:38,507
这是过时的香槟话。
That's the out-of-date champagne talking.

816
00:55:40,267 --> 00:55:41,959
是啊，他真不该卖这个。
Yeah, he really shouldn't be selling that.

817
00:55:44,824 --> 00:55:46,377
哦。嗯。
Oh. Mmm.

818
00:55:47,309 --> 00:55:49,656
没有老师把我们分开。
No teacher to pull us apart.

819
00:56:00,287 --> 00:56:02,151
你们是另一组吗?
You guys are the other group?

820
00:56:02,255 --> 00:56:06,811
哦,男人。我们以为会是犯罪集团之类的。唷。
Oh, man. We thought it was gonna be, like, a crime syndicate or something. Phew.

821
00:56:09,227 --> 00:56:10,919
我不知道你在说什么。
I don't know what you're talking about.

822
00:56:11,022 --> 00:56:14,612
抱歉，我们太没礼貌了。我是泰勒，这是埃里克。
Sorry, we are being super rude. I'm Tyler, this is Eric.

823
00:56:14,716 --> 00:56:16,269
我们在哈佛开了一家博彩俱乐部。
We run a betting club at Harvard.

824
00:56:16,373 --> 00:56:20,687
我们叫Random Industries，这也是我的滑板品牌的名字。
We're called Random Industries, which is also the name of my skateboard brand.

825
00:56:20,791 --> 00:56:23,414
我就知道会有别人的。
Well, I figured there'd be somebody else.

826
00:56:23,518 --> 00:56:28,695
我也是，但我没想到会这样。看看你们。这就像。
Me, too, but I mean, I didn't expect this. Look at you guys. It's like Up.

827
00:56:31,457 --> 00:56:33,459
你想喝杯香槟吗?
Would you like a glass of champagne?

828
00:56:33,562 --> 00:56:36,531
不，我只喝野格和红牛。但是谢谢你。
No, I only drink Jager and Red Bull. But thank you.

829
00:56:36,634 --> 00:56:40,949
好吧，至少你永远不用担心变成我们这个年纪了。
Oh, well, at least you'll never have to worry about being our age.

830
00:56:43,158 --> 00:56:49,371
听着，我们同时玩只会伤害彼此，所以我有个更好的提议。
Look, we're really only hurting each other by playing at the same time, so here's a better offer.

831
00:56:49,475 --> 00:56:54,790
你加入我的小组，把你的钱加到我们的罐子里，我们来处理所有的赌注。
You join my group, add your capital to our pot, and we'll handle all the betting.

832
00:56:57,172 --> 00:56:59,277
嗯，我不知道。
Well, I don't know.

833
00:57:00,140 --> 00:57:02,246
我们喜欢做自己的事。
We kind of like to do our own thing.

834
00:57:02,729 --> 00:57:03,834
什么?
What?

835
00:57:03,937 --> 00:57:06,112
你什么都不用做就能得到报酬。
You'll get a cut without having to do anything.

836
00:57:06,215 --> 00:57:11,255
我有一群赌徒。你甚至不用离开你的摇椅。
I have an army of bettors. You won't even have to leave your rocking chairs.

837
00:57:11,911 --> 00:57:13,222
我们很好。
We're good.

838
00:57:13,326 --> 00:57:16,605
这是为了赚钱。你喜欢钱，对吧?
This is about making money. You like money, right?

839
00:57:16,709 --> 00:57:20,195
不像我喜欢其他东西那么喜欢。
Well, not as much as I like other things.

840
00:57:20,298 --> 00:57:21,955
哦,我的上帝。
Oh, my God.

841
00:57:22,059 --> 00:57:28,410
如果你们不介意的话，今天是我们的结婚纪念日。
Uh, now, look, if you two don't mind, this is our anniversary.

842
00:57:28,514 --> 00:57:33,242
你破坏了我们酒店的气氛。
And you are killing the ambience of our liquor store.

843
00:57:33,346 --> 00:57:36,073
欢迎你在路上喝一杯红牛。
You're welcome to take a Red Bull for the road.

844
00:57:36,176 --> 00:57:38,662
或者一盒果汁。
Or maybe a juice box.

845
00:57:44,702 --> 00:57:45,979
你数学很好。
You're good at math.

846
00:57:46,739 --> 00:57:48,534
耶!
Yay!

847
00:57:48,637 --> 00:57:53,608
我相信这对农场很有帮助，但在哈佛，我们学到了一种叫做二项分布的东西。
I'm sure that helps out on the farm, but at Harvard, we learn a little something called binomial distribution.

848
00:57:54,609 --> 00:57:56,265
查一下。
Look it up.

849
00:57:56,369 --> 00:57:58,830
然后你就会明白为什么你自己填单子的几率会更高。
Then you'll see why your odds are better when you fill out your own slips.

850
00:57:58,854 --> 00:58:00,477
不客气
You're welcome.

851
00:58:00,580 --> 00:58:05,930
二项分布只考虑两个因素。
Binomial distribution only considers two factors.

852
00:58:06,034 --> 00:58:13,559
不是第三个，那是人为失误，也不是第四个，那是你填票的时间。
Not a third, which is human error, or a fourth, which is the time it takes for you to fill in the tickets.

853
00:58:13,662 --> 00:58:19,599
你每赢10万就能赚32块。
You gain a whooping 32 bucks for every $100,000 you win.

854
00:58:21,290 --> 00:58:22,499
不客气
You're welcome.

855
00:58:24,293 --> 00:58:25,985
严重吗?闭嘴!
Seriously? Shut up!

856
00:58:30,092 --> 00:58:31,438
什么?
What?

857
00:58:32,923 --> 00:58:36,167
我想没有傻孩子就不叫毕业舞会了。
I guess it wouldn't be a prom without dumb teenagers.

858
00:58:38,825 --> 00:58:41,759
这让我想起了我们上次讲到的地方。
That reminds me of where we left off.

859
00:59:11,133 --> 00:59:12,790
那房子归我了?
So I get the house?

860
00:59:12,894 --> 00:59:14,516
是的。你会得到一切。
Yes. You get everything.

861
00:59:14,620 --> 00:59:19,590
比尔只想保住他在GS战略公司的份额。
Bill just wants to keep his share of GS Strategies.

862
00:59:19,694 --> 00:59:21,765
无论什么。我得到了房子。
Whatever. I got the house.

863
00:59:24,422 --> 00:59:26,908
祝你好运，坎迪斯。
Well, good luck to you, Candace.

864
00:59:27,011 --> 00:59:30,290
你知道吗，我们在那里度过了几年美好的时光然后一切都变糟了。
You know, we had a few good years there before it all turned to shit.

865
00:59:30,394 --> 00:59:32,430
我希望你能找到你的青蛙。
And I hope you find your frog.

866
00:59:33,190 --> 00:59:34,398
啊哈。
Uh-huh.

867
00:59:36,124 --> 00:59:39,541
嘿，什么是GS什么的?
Hey, what is GS whatever?

868
00:59:39,645 --> 00:59:42,130
哦,是的。我是这个小公司的一份子。
Oh, yeah. That's a little company I'm a part of.

869
00:59:42,233 --> 00:59:43,649
我们每个月都中彩票。
Uh, we win the lottery every month.

870
00:59:52,830 --> 00:59:54,383
在见到你。
See you around.

871
01:00:04,739 --> 01:00:06,982
我想让冰淇淋店重新开张。
I'd love to re-open the ice cream shop.

872
01:00:07,086 --> 01:00:10,607
现在你可以以每年1.19美元的价格出租了。
Well, now you can lease it for $1.19 a year.

873
01:00:10,710 --> 01:00:13,368
市区基金会支付剩下的。
And the Downtown fund will cover the rest.

874
01:00:13,471 --> 01:00:15,750
1.19美元吗?嗯。
$1.19?Mmm-hmm.

875
01:00:15,853 --> 01:00:19,132
哦，是一欧元。这是一个复杂的故事。
Oh, it's a euro. It's a complicated story.

876
01:00:19,236 --> 01:00:20,824
杰瑞可以解释给你听。
Jerry can explain it to you.

877
01:00:32,318 --> 01:00:34,354
男孩,男孩。
Boy, oh, boy.

878
01:00:34,458 --> 01:00:37,150
我刚买了一辆克尔维特。是的，我看得出来。
I just bought a Corvette. Yeah, I can see that.

879
01:00:37,254 --> 01:00:41,223
你想下星期去骑一骑吗?我要坐游轮去我的家乡。
You want to take it for a ride next week? I'm going on a cruise to Me-hi-co.

880
01:00:41,327 --> 01:00:44,330
哦，不，我想我不能说这个。
Oh, no, I don't think I can get into it.

881
01:00:44,433 --> 01:00:46,815
好吧，老头，随你便。
All right, old man, suit yourself.

882
01:00:46,919 --> 01:00:48,058
另一组。
There's another group.

883
01:00:48,161 --> 01:00:49,715
No.Yep。
No.Yep.

884
01:00:49,818 --> 01:00:52,131
一些哈佛的孩子发现了这一点。
Some kids from Harvard figured it out.

885
01:00:52,234 --> 01:00:53,926
嗯,这很糟糕。
Well, that sucks.

886
01:00:54,029 --> 01:00:55,721
我们应该没事的。
We should be okay.

887
01:00:55,824 --> 01:01:00,104
我们还是赢了足够的钱让人们重建爵士音乐节继续下去。
We're still winning enough for people to rebuild and get the jazz fest going.

888
01:01:00,208 --> 01:01:02,486
我们只需要坚持下去。
We just have to stay in the game.

889
01:01:02,589 --> 01:01:05,075
我们将。你说得倒轻巧。
And we will. Well, that's easy for you to say.

890
01:01:05,178 --> 01:01:08,043
你又不是连续5天站在机器前。
You're not standing at a machine for five days straight.

891
01:01:08,906 --> 01:01:10,026
我说过我要换班的。
I said I would take a shift.

892
01:01:10,114 --> 01:01:11,391
不,不。没关系。
No, no. That's okay.

893
01:01:11,495 --> 01:01:13,324
是啊，因为你们喜欢，对吧?
Yeah, because you guys like it, right?

894
01:01:13,428 --> 01:01:16,120
是的,我们做的。是的,你做的事情。是的,你做的事情。
Yeah, we do. Yeah, you do. Yeah, you do.

895
01:01:17,466 --> 01:01:19,537
真高兴你今天放假了。
So glad you got the day off.

896
01:01:19,641 --> 01:01:23,645
我好像不知道。——哦,哦……你们这几周是怎么做到的?
Well, it doesn't feel like I did.- Oh, oh... How did you guys do this for weeks?

897
01:01:23,749 --> 01:01:25,371
因为这是一场冒险。
Because it's an adventure.

898
01:01:25,474 --> 01:01:27,235
不，这不是冒险。
Oh, no, this is not an adventure.

899
01:01:27,338 --> 01:01:31,480
而是在满是妓女和毒贩的汽车旅馆里被纸割伤。
It's getting paper cuts in a motel filled with prostitutes and drug dealers.

900
01:01:31,584 --> 01:01:33,344
哦。
Oh.

901
01:01:33,448 --> 01:01:35,277
道恩，你没必要这么做。
Well, Dawn, you don't have to do it.

902
01:01:35,381 --> 01:01:37,210
哦，不，不，我想。我做的事。
Oh, no, no, I want to. I do.

903
01:01:37,314 --> 01:01:48,705
我是说，我从来没有机会和你们在一起，而且，你知道…感觉被困在一家恶心的酒店里，用丢失的票装满箱子只是我永远不会忘记的记忆。
I mean, I never get to spend time with you guys, and, you know... Feeling trapped in a gross hotel, filling bins with losing tickets is just a memory I will never ever forget.

904
01:01:50,154 --> 01:01:52,881
哦。这是一个赢家。
Oops. This one's a winner.

905
01:01:52,985 --> 01:01:56,989
哦，你错过了。我完成了。我完成了。
Oh, you missed it.Okay. I'm done. I'm done.

906
01:01:57,092 --> 01:01:59,484
你什么时候能把所有的赢家都交上来?
Hey, when's the part where you get to turn in all the winners?

907
01:01:59,508 --> 01:02:02,442
因为我会这么做的。嗯，那很有趣。
Because I will do that. Well, that is fun.

908
01:02:02,546 --> 01:02:08,794
我们得再检查一下所有的…旅馆里有酒吧吗?
We're gonna have to double check all the... Is there a bar at this motel?

909
01:02:17,388 --> 01:02:18,700
Grazio先生吗?
Mr. Grazio?

910
01:02:20,391 --> 01:02:22,704
玛雅可要注意了。波士顿环球报。
Maya Jordon. Boston Globe.

911
01:02:23,981 --> 01:02:26,535
我有一些关于《WinFall》游戏的问题。
I had some questions about the WinFall game.

912
01:02:26,639 --> 01:02:28,848
梅兰妮·霍金斯负责我们的宣传。
Well, Melanie Hawkins handles our publicity.

913
01:02:28,952 --> 01:02:31,678
但这项运动为该州带来了巨大的成功。
But the game has been a huge success for the state.

914
01:02:31,782 --> 01:02:33,577
不仅仅是为了国家。
Not just for the state.

915
01:02:33,680 --> 01:02:36,487
你知道密歇根有个玩家每个月都能赢几百万吗?
Are you aware there's a player in Michigan winning millions every month?

916
01:02:36,511 --> 01:02:40,204
我们为学校筹集了很多钱，但没人写这方面的文章。
We raise a lot of money for schools, but nobody does an article about that.

917
01:02:40,308 --> 01:02:43,794
某个退休的人走运了，就派了个重点报道的记者来?
Some retiree gets lucky and they send a Spotlight reporter?

918
01:02:43,898 --> 01:02:45,865
我没说他退休了。
I didn't say he was a retiree.

919
01:02:47,418 --> 01:02:48,868
是啊，你知道的，这是彩票。
Yeah, well, you know, it's a lottery.

920
01:02:48,972 --> 01:02:51,906
人赢。所以，不能称之为新闻。
People win. So, wouldn't call it news.

921
01:02:52,561 --> 01:02:53,942
我有个会。
I have a meeting.

922
01:02:55,150 --> 01:02:56,600
谢谢您的宝贵时间。
Thanks for your time.

923
01:03:00,880 --> 01:03:02,951
早上,莱昂。——早上,杰里。
Morning, Leon.- Morning, Jerry.

924
01:03:03,055 --> 01:03:05,505
给你做了一口新鲜的法式烤肉。——哦。
Made you a fresh pot. French roast.- Oh.

925
01:03:05,609 --> 01:03:08,094
哇。你得到的。
Wow. You're getting fancy.

926
01:03:25,698 --> 01:03:27,596
嘿,杰瑞。
Hey, Jerry.

927
01:03:29,460 --> 01:03:31,255
他们说我能在这里找到你。
They said I'd find you here.

928
01:03:31,359 --> 01:03:32,567
你想要什么?
What do you want?

929
01:03:32,670 --> 01:03:34,327
不会太久的。
This won't take long.

930
01:03:34,431 --> 01:03:36,329
我们不加入你的小组。
We're not joining your group.

931
01:03:36,433 --> 01:03:37,675
我不希望你这样。
I don't want you to.

932
01:03:37,779 --> 01:03:40,195
我不需要你的资金了。
I don't really need your capital anymore.

933
01:03:40,299 --> 01:03:41,414
我只需要你退出游戏。
I just need you out of the game.

934
01:03:41,438 --> 01:03:44,096
所以,你是。什么?
So, you're out. What?

935
01:03:44,199 --> 01:03:48,548
你看，你不像计算数字那样擅长计算人。
See, you're not really as good at calculating people as you are numbers.

936
01:03:48,652 --> 01:03:53,139
所以你还没算过像我这样的人为了获胜会怎么做。
So you haven't really run the math on what somebody like me would do to win.

937
01:04:00,181 --> 01:04:02,252
你会怎么做?
And what would you do?

938
01:04:03,667 --> 01:04:08,258
组建一支由你所见过的最聪明的孩子组成的军队来对抗你和所有和你一起玩的人。
Set an army of the smartest kids you've ever met against you and everyone you play with.

939
01:04:10,087 --> 01:04:14,057
我们黑进了州彩票公司想知道你在哪里下注。
We hacked into the state lottery to find where you were betting.

940
01:04:15,334 --> 01:04:19,234
你觉得我们不能黑进你的账户吗?
You don't think that we can hack into your accounts?

941
01:04:20,235 --> 01:04:23,307
你的信用?你的身份吗?
Your credit? Your identity?

942
01:04:24,584 --> 01:04:33,800
这并不难。我的意思是……大多数人认为防火墙是他们烟囱里的东西，所以…你为什么要这么做?
It won't be hard. I mean... Most of them think a firewall is something in their chimney, so... Why are you doing this?

943
01:04:33,904 --> 01:04:36,942
这只是数学。任何个人。
It's just math. Nothing personal.

944
01:04:37,943 --> 01:04:40,393
听着，你干得不错。
Look, you had a good run.

945
01:04:40,497 --> 01:04:43,224
你为梅贝瑞赚了些钱。
You made some cash for Mayberry.

946
01:04:43,327 --> 01:04:45,053
但这是结束了。
But it's over.

947
01:04:46,883 --> 01:04:48,298
享受你的黄金岁月。
Enjoy your golden years.

948
01:05:04,970 --> 01:05:09,215
嘿，你觉得我们需要几天时间?
Hey, so how many days do you think we'll need?

949
01:05:10,976 --> 01:05:12,115
一个也没有。
None.

950
01:05:12,978 --> 01:05:14,289
我们出局了。
We're out of the game.

951
01:05:18,259 --> 01:05:19,432
杰里!
Jerry!

952
01:05:27,682 --> 01:05:33,930
哦……嗯…好吧。呃。
Oh... Uh... Okay. Uh.

953
01:05:35,379 --> 01:05:48,496
哦,男孩。嗯,嗯…我很遗憾地告诉大家，由于游戏中出现了一些新的变量……嗯…我们不能再玩了。
Oh, boy. Well, uh... I'm sad to report that, due to some new variables in the game... Um... We're going to have to stop playing.

954
01:06:03,511 --> 01:06:07,411
嗯…我很抱歉。
Um... I am sorry.

955
01:06:32,781 --> 01:06:38,132
你真的要让一个大学里的小聪明把这一切都夺走吗?
So, you're really going to let some college smart ass take all this away from you?

956
01:06:40,548 --> 01:06:48,487
他做某事的可能性大于好处。这与数学无关。这是关于人类的。
The odds that he might do something outweigh the benefits... It's not about the math. It's about being human.

957
01:06:53,802 --> 01:07:02,156
你知道，爸爸，我…我看着你一生中很多时候都被人忽视被人摆布。
You know, Dad, I... I've watched you spend so much of your life just being overlooked and pushed around.

958
01:07:04,572 --> 01:07:06,539
没人知道你能做什么。
Nobody knew what you could do.

959
01:07:07,954 --> 01:07:09,232
没有人关心。
Nobody cared.

960
01:07:10,854 --> 01:07:16,204
然后你终于抓住了机会，把我们都带来了。
And then you finally took your shot, and you brought us all with you.

961
01:07:17,688 --> 01:07:21,278
你知道你做了什么吗?你让我们的小镇显得很大。
You know what you did? You made our little town feel big.

962
01:07:22,693 --> 01:07:24,247
所以它们都在里面。
That's why they're all in there.

963
01:07:26,111 --> 01:07:27,940
所以我才会在那里。
That's why I was in there.

964
01:07:45,544 --> 01:07:47,063
他会没事的。
He'll be okay.

965
01:07:54,346 --> 01:07:57,073
你知道我为什么不喜欢钓鱼吗?
You know why I don't like to fish?

966
01:07:58,315 --> 01:07:59,454
不。
No.

967
01:08:00,697 --> 01:08:04,528
我上次去的时候，带着他。
The last time that I went, I took him with me.

968
01:08:04,632 --> 01:08:08,325
那时他16、17岁。
He was 16, 17.

969
01:08:10,396 --> 01:08:19,440
然后我开始计算漂浮物移动的速度这样我就能算出水流的速度。
And I started calculating how fast the bobber was moving so I can figure out the speed of the current.

970
01:08:21,200 --> 01:08:26,378
然后我听到他问我:“爸爸，你觉得怎么样?”
And then I hear him ask me, "What do you think, Dad?"

971
01:08:29,035 --> 01:08:37,768
就在那一刻，我意识到他说的是一个他喜欢的女孩。
And it was at that moment that I realized he was talking about a girl that he liked.

972
01:08:37,872 --> 01:08:39,184
和…哦。
And... Oh.

973
01:08:40,392 --> 01:08:42,048
我完全不知道。
I had no idea.

974
01:08:43,015 --> 01:08:48,503
你知道,这是……这从来不是一种天赋。这是个骗局。
You know, it's... It's never been a gift. It's been a trick.

975
01:08:50,056 --> 01:09:01,482
你的大脑告诉你，你看到了别人看不到的东西，但最终，你看到的只是更少。
Your brain tells you that you see what other's don't, but in the end, you're just seeing less.

976
01:09:06,280 --> 01:09:11,250
嗯…我想今晚我要步行回家。
Uh... I think I'll walk home tonight.

977
01:09:26,300 --> 01:09:29,820
好了，伙计们，这可是个大场面。现在是我们大家的事了，所以要珍惜。
All right, guys, it's gonna be a big one. It's all of us now, so make it count.

978
01:09:29,924 --> 01:09:31,408
走,走,走。
Go, go, go.

979
01:09:35,032 --> 01:09:36,551
这周末滚吧。
Roll down's this weekend.

980
01:09:38,588 --> 01:09:41,004
嗯。我知道。
Mmm-hmm. I know.

981
01:09:52,049 --> 01:09:54,051
我只是想做正确的事。
I'm just trying to do the right thing.

982
01:09:54,155 --> 01:09:58,504
哦，你总是这样。我喜欢你这一点。
Oh, you always do. I love that about you.

983
01:09:58,608 --> 01:10:02,094
所以镇上的人都相信你会去冒险。
And that's why everyone in town trusts you to take a chance.

984
01:10:03,337 --> 01:10:09,895
我从没见过你做过的一件事就是在找到解决办法之前就放弃。
The one thing I have never seen you do is give up on a problem before you find a solution.

985
01:10:09,998 --> 01:10:11,586
你是什么意思?
What do you mean?

986
01:10:11,690 --> 01:10:20,940
你计算了泰勒的威胁，和游戏的价值，但二项分布没有考虑第三个因素。
Well, you've calculated Tyler's threat, and the value of the game, but binomial distribution doesn't consider the third factor.

987
01:10:21,044 --> 01:10:24,668
只要你我拥有彼此，我们就不怕犯傻。
That as long as you and I have each other, we are not afraid to be stupid.

988
01:10:28,638 --> 01:10:30,018
你真是疯了。
You're bat shit crazy.

989
01:10:36,956 --> 01:10:38,544
哦,有史蒂夫。
Oh, there's Steve.

990
01:10:40,995 --> 01:10:43,100
我们要去马萨诸塞州。
We're heading to Massachusetts.

991
01:10:43,204 --> 01:10:47,243
哈哈!我看到你!抓住他们，孩子!
Ha-ha! I see you! Go get 'em, boy!

992
01:11:05,330 --> 01:11:10,542
哇!好，我们开始吧!玛姬!给我五个。
Whoa! Yeah, let's do this! Marge! Give me five.

993
01:11:10,645 --> 01:11:14,200
杰里!你是一个疯子。英镑我。
Jerry! You're a madman. Pound me.

994
01:11:17,445 --> 01:11:19,216
我还以为没有分手会更有意思呢。
I thought it was supposed to be more without the split.

995
01:11:19,240 --> 01:11:24,176
你查过其他索赔吗?是的。有一个。
Did you check for other claims? Yes. There was one.

996
01:11:24,280 --> 01:11:26,558
在哪里?桑德兰。
Where? Sunderland.

997
01:11:26,661 --> 01:11:28,249
狗屎!
Shit!

998
01:11:28,353 --> 01:11:31,148
他说你在虚张声势，好吗?除了接受，我们别无他法。
He called your bluff, okay? There's nothing we can do but accept it.

999
01:11:31,252 --> 01:11:33,185
如果有一个滚下，他就会玩。
If there's a roll down, he's going to play.

1000
01:11:34,359 --> 01:11:37,120
除非我们创建向下滚动。什么?
Unless we create the roll down. What?

1001
01:11:37,223 --> 01:11:39,191
一卷要好几周，对吧?
It takes weeks for a roll down, right?

1002
01:11:39,295 --> 01:11:47,924
我的意思是，WinFall每天赚10万，当它达到200万时，我们知道要下注了，所有人都开始下注，本杰明·巴顿就上了他的车。
I mean, WinFall takes in 100 grand a day, and then when it hits two million, we know a roll down is coming in, and everybody starts betting, and Benjamin Button gets in his truck.

1003
01:11:48,027 --> 01:11:52,135
但如果我们在没人预料到的时候制造了一个滚下，我们就把它全拿走。
But if we create a roll down when nobody expects it, we take it all.

1004
01:11:52,238 --> 01:11:54,033
我们把其他玩家排挤出去。
We squeeze the other players out.

1005
01:11:54,137 --> 01:12:01,938
我们用我们的黑客追踪大麻，等它涨到一百万再开奖，然后我们在一天内下注一百万。我是说，我们拥有这个游戏。
We use our hack to track the pot, we wait for it to hit a million before a drawing, and then we bet a million in one day. I mean, we own the game.

1006
01:12:02,041 --> 01:12:04,872
那我们从哪弄到一百万?
And where do we get $1 million?

1007
01:12:08,324 --> 01:12:11,257
正如您从我们的回报中看到的，它是有效的。
As you can see by our returns, it works.

1008
01:12:11,361 --> 01:12:13,846
有了更多的资本，我们就能控制局面。
And with more capital, we can control the game.

1009
01:12:13,950 --> 01:12:15,503
你爸爸也参与了吗?
Is your dad in on this?

1010
01:12:16,159 --> 01:12:20,646
不。他……嗯…认为你要去上大学?
No. He... Um... Thinks you're going to college?

1011
01:12:20,750 --> 01:12:23,373
他以为我和他一样，在学习做律师。
He thinks I'm studying to be a lawyer, like him.

1012
01:12:23,477 --> 01:12:27,204
但据我所知，我父亲从没一夜赚过一百万。
But last time I checked, my father never made $1 million in a night.

1013
01:12:31,036 --> 01:12:32,658
我们有14个小时来搞定。
We have 14 hours to pull this off.

1014
01:12:32,762 --> 01:12:35,223
到达目的地，打印好所有的票后再离开。
Get to your location and don't leave until you print all your tickets.

1015
01:12:35,247 --> 01:12:38,492
有些地方可能会推迟打印一整天，但不要让他们这么做。
Some locations might push back on printing all day, but do not let them.

1016
01:12:38,595 --> 01:12:39,631
他们为我们工作。
They work for us.

1017
01:12:39,734 --> 01:12:40,735
让我们骑。
Let's ride.

1018
01:12:40,839 --> 01:12:41,839
是的!——哇!
Yes!- Whoo!

1019
01:12:42,772 --> 01:12:43,772
是的。
Yeah.

1020
01:12:45,430 --> 01:12:51,297
嘿。如果有人赢了头奖而我们输了100万怎么办?
Hey. What happens if somebody wins the jackpot and we lose $1 million?

1021
01:12:51,401 --> 01:12:54,439
除了因为我花光了所有学费而辍学吗?
Beyond dropping out of school because I blew my entire tuition?

1022
01:12:55,819 --> 01:12:57,901
我觉得其中一个投资人可能会杀了我。
I think one of those investors might actually kill me.

1023
01:12:57,925 --> 01:12:59,927
哦。
Ooh.

1024
01:13:00,030 --> 01:13:02,447
你对吧?-好的，我知道了。
You all right?- Yeah, I got it.

1025
01:13:02,550 --> 01:13:04,587
哦。好吧。
Oh. Okay.

1026
01:13:06,589 --> 01:13:07,693
我拿到钥匙了。
I got the key.

1027
01:13:09,039 --> 01:13:10,420
到底是什么?
What the heck?

1028
01:13:11,663 --> 01:13:12,767
哦。
Oh.

1029
01:13:12,871 --> 01:13:14,251
嘿!
Hey!

1030
01:13:15,252 --> 01:13:16,322
我们错过了!
We missed it!

1031
01:13:16,426 --> 01:13:19,049
怎么，有人把六个号码都打中了吗?
What, someone actually hit all six numbers?

1032
01:13:19,153 --> 01:13:20,396
不。不。它滚下来。
No. No. It rolled down.

1033
01:13:20,499 --> 01:13:22,915
不,那是不可能的。这只是第二周。
No, that's impossible. It's only the second week.

1034
01:13:23,019 --> 01:13:24,814
它从不在三点前滚下来。
It never rolls down before three.

1035
01:13:24,917 --> 01:13:27,195
它昨晚滚下来了，我们错过了。
It rolled down last night, and we missed it.

1036
01:13:30,647 --> 01:13:33,201
哈佛大学的小组是自己触发的。
The Harvard group triggered it on their own.

1037
01:13:33,305 --> 01:13:34,996
他们怎么知道该赌多少钱?
How would they know how much to bet?

1038
01:13:35,100 --> 01:13:38,862
彩票没有公布金额…嗯,他们知道。
The lottery doesn't post the amount... Well, they knew.

1039
01:13:39,863 --> 01:13:40,864
杰里?
Jerry?

1040
01:13:43,488 --> 01:13:44,868
杰瑞，你要去哪儿?
Where are you going, Jerry?

1041
01:13:47,112 --> 01:13:48,596
杰里!
Jerry!

1042
01:14:21,077 --> 01:14:24,287
都上新闻了。彩票甚至没有预见到它的到来。
It's on the freakin' news. The lottery didn't even see it coming.

1043
01:14:24,390 --> 01:14:26,358
这太史诗了。
This is so epic.

1044
01:14:28,671 --> 01:14:29,775
嘿,杰瑞。
Hey, Jerry.

1045
01:14:29,879 --> 01:14:33,296
怎么，你是开着拖拉机过来跟我大吼大叫的吗?
What, did you come ridin' in on your tractor to come give me a whoopin'?

1046
01:14:33,399 --> 01:14:35,712
相信我，我也想。
Believe me, I wanted to.

1047
01:14:37,300 --> 01:14:38,853
我内心的一部分仍然如此。
Part of me still does.

1048
01:14:41,200 --> 01:14:48,760
但是开了这么长时间的车来这里，大部分都消失了。
But then on the long drive here, well, most of that just, poof, went away.

1049
01:14:48,863 --> 01:14:52,488
我意识到我并不是真的生你的气。
And I realized that I wasn't really angry at you.

1050
01:14:53,178 --> 01:14:55,007
我很失望。
I'm disappointed.

1051
01:14:55,111 --> 01:14:56,699
你对我很失望?
Aw, you're disappointed in me?

1052
01:14:56,802 --> 01:14:59,011
不,不是你。你是无关紧要的。
No, not you. You're insignificant.

1053
01:14:59,115 --> 01:15:05,501
不，我很失望让你这样一个自私的孩子影响了我。嗯。
No, I was disappointed that I let a selfish kid like you get to me. Huh.

1054
01:15:05,604 --> 01:15:14,371
我数学一直很好，但我要花很长时间才能理解别人。
I was always good with math, but it took a long time for me to figure people out.

1055
01:15:14,475 --> 01:15:18,099
告诉我们，杰瑞，你发现了什么?
So, tell us, Jerry, what did you figure out?

1056
01:15:18,203 --> 01:15:21,413
解决方案不是数字。
That the solution isn't numbers.

1057
01:15:21,517 --> 01:15:27,315
你说我买彩票是因为我一无所有。
You told me that I was playing the lottery because I had nothing else.

1058
01:15:27,419 --> 01:15:34,875
但你不愿分享这壶是因为你没有别的了。
But the reason you won't share the pot is because you have nothing else.

1059
01:15:34,978 --> 01:15:39,396
你以为做屋里最聪明的人就够了吗。
You think being the smartest guy in the room is all that matters.

1060
01:15:39,500 --> 01:15:44,988
但事实证明，这个房间才是最重要的。
But it turns out it's this room that matters.

1061
01:15:45,092 --> 01:15:49,855
这些聪明的年轻人帮你致富。
All these bright, young people helping you get rich.

1062
01:15:52,271 --> 01:15:55,378
你是如何帮助他们的?
How are you helping them?

1063
01:15:55,481 --> 01:15:58,933
我猜你还没算出来吧?
Guess you haven't run the math out on that, huh?

1064
01:16:01,108 --> 01:16:04,456
无论如何……我的拖拉机跑。
Anyway... my tractor's running.

1065
01:16:08,702 --> 01:16:10,807
祝你万事如意。
I wish you all the best of luck.

1066
01:16:20,645 --> 01:16:23,475
什么?继续数吧。
What? Just get back to counting.

1067
01:16:25,477 --> 01:16:30,344
如果哈佛队能触发下滚，他们就能掌控比赛。
If the Harvard team can trigger a roll down, they run the game.

1068
01:16:30,447 --> 01:16:32,001
所以我们触发了自己的向下滚动。
So we trigger our own roll down.

1069
01:16:32,104 --> 01:16:33,692
是的，我们有足够的现金。
Yeah, we have enough cash.

1070
01:16:33,796 --> 01:16:34,900
No.Why吗?
No.Why?

1071
01:16:35,004 --> 01:16:37,731
因为这对普通球员不公平。
Because it's not fair to the regular players.

1072
01:16:37,834 --> 01:16:39,491
他是对的。我们不是这样的人。
He's right. It's not who we are.

1073
01:16:39,595 --> 01:16:40,734
但我们已经很接近了。
But we're so close.

1074
01:16:40,837 --> 01:16:43,357
我是说，市中心又回来了，爵士音乐节就要来了。
I mean, downtown is back, the jazz fest is coming.

1075
01:16:43,460 --> 01:16:46,060
如果我们一直赢，我们就可以雇人去那里打球。
If we keep winning, we could actually hire somebody to play there.

1076
01:16:46,118 --> 01:16:47,292
你应该找钢铁丹。
You should get Steely Dan.

1077
01:16:47,395 --> 01:16:49,984
这主意太棒了。我们应该找钢铁丹。
That is an amazing idea. We should get Steely Dan.

1078
01:16:50,088 --> 01:16:51,952
我们不玩就赢不了。
We can't win if we can't play.

1079
01:16:52,055 --> 01:16:53,505
这太糟糕了。
Well, this just sucks.

1080
01:16:53,609 --> 01:16:56,888
彩票不能阻止我们，一群大学生却能?
The lottery isn't stopping us, but a bunch of college kids are?

1081
01:16:56,991 --> 01:17:00,408
嗯，说得好。是什么?我不是在说什么。
Huh, that's a good point. What is? I wasn't making a point.

1082
01:17:00,512 --> 01:17:03,653
为什么彩票没有阻止他们?
Why isn't the lottery stopping them?

1083
01:17:03,757 --> 01:17:06,207
那是因为他们不在乎。
It's because they don't care.

1084
01:17:07,243 --> 01:17:08,485
哦。
Oh.

1085
01:17:09,107 --> 01:17:10,487
这可能是我们的答案。
That could be our answer.

1086
01:17:16,079 --> 01:17:20,774
很高兴见到我们的忠实玩家，赛尔比先生和夫人。
Always happy to meet with our loyal players, Mr. and Mrs. Selbee.

1087
01:17:20,877 --> 01:17:24,156
哦,请。“杰里和马姬”就可以了。
Oh, please. "Jerry and Marge" is fine.

1088
01:17:25,226 --> 01:17:26,266
我们能为您做些什么?
What can we help you with?

1089
01:17:26,331 --> 01:17:27,504
事情是这样的。
So here's the thing.

1090
01:17:27,608 --> 01:17:37,583
几年前，州彩票一直在赔钱，几乎没有人中头奖，所以超级百万吃掉了你的午餐。
The state lottery was losing money a few years ago, and hardly anybody was winning the jackpot, so Mega Millions ate your lunch.

1091
01:17:37,687 --> 01:17:40,897
然后随着WinFall的到来，一切都改变了。
Then along comes WinFall, and all that changes.

1092
01:17:41,001 --> 01:17:47,248
你们赚了几百万，然后才意识到数学上的缺陷。
You folks made millions, before you realized there was a flaw in the math.

1093
01:17:48,215 --> 01:17:56,188
一开始你可能会惊慌失措，因为你知道一旦所有人看到它，游戏就会崩溃。
You probably panicked at first, because you knew that once everybody saw it, that the game would collapse.

1094
01:17:56,292 --> 01:17:58,294
只是他们没有看到。
Except they didn't see it.

1095
01:17:58,397 --> 01:18:01,711
只有我和几个哈佛的孩子。
Only me and a few kids from Harvard.

1096
01:18:01,815 --> 01:18:08,235
这意味着我们在游戏中投入了数百万美元，让你的利润飙升。
Which meant that we were pushing millions into the game, and, boy, sent your profits through the roof.

1097
01:18:09,788 --> 01:18:15,104
所以，突然之间，你的错误变成了你的意外之财。
So, all of a sudden, your mistake became your windfall.

1098
01:18:15,207 --> 01:18:16,484
我给了他那句台词。
I gave him that line.

1099
01:18:16,588 --> 01:18:18,970
是啊，没错，而且很漂亮。
Yeah, she sure did, and it's a dandy.

1100
01:18:20,350 --> 01:18:22,076
你到底想要什么?
So, what exactly do you want?

1101
01:18:22,180 --> 01:18:24,113
透明度。
Transparency.

1102
01:18:24,216 --> 01:18:29,601
我们希望网站显示的大小，头奖。
We'd like the website to show the size of the jackpot.

1103
01:18:29,705 --> 01:18:33,225
这可以防止任何团体强行向下滚动。
That prevents any group from forcing a roll down.

1104
01:18:34,364 --> 01:18:37,264
对所有参赛选手都公平。
Makes it fair for anybody who plays.

1105
01:18:37,367 --> 01:18:42,372
我们想在桑德兰的酒屋买两台机器。
And we would like two machines at the Liquor Hut in Sunderland.

1106
01:18:42,476 --> 01:18:43,960
这样我们才能在一起。
So we can be together.

1107
01:18:45,410 --> 01:18:47,239
这是我们的黄金岁月。
These are our golden years.

1108
01:18:53,763 --> 01:18:55,178
我们会处理的。
We'll take care of it.

1109
01:18:56,110 --> 01:18:58,043
是啊，我们很快就会有新戏了。
Yeah, we'll be making another play soon.

1110
01:18:59,424 --> 01:19:03,117
听你这么说太好了。是的。说话很快。
That's great to hear. Yeah. Talk soon.

1111
01:19:03,221 --> 01:19:05,026
他想从律所引进其他合伙人。
He's wants to bring in other partners from the firm.

1112
01:19:05,050 --> 01:19:06,707
伙计，我们可能永远都不需要一份真正的工作。
Dude, we might not ever need a real job.

1113
01:19:06,811 --> 01:19:08,502
他们中了头奖。什么?
They posted the jackpot. What?

1114
01:19:08,605 --> 01:19:12,437
彩票改变了网站。你可以在网上追踪头奖。
The lottery changed the website. You can track the jackpot online.

1115
01:19:12,540 --> 01:19:14,025
我们不能再把它滚下来了。
We can't roll it down anymore.

1116
01:19:14,128 --> 01:19:16,130
大便。大便。
Shit. Shit.

1117
01:19:17,097 --> 01:19:19,824
好吧，我们来对付这家伙。
All right, let's break this guy.

1118
01:19:19,927 --> 01:19:21,653
他想要战争?我们会给他一个。
He wants a war? We'll give him one.

1119
01:19:30,593 --> 01:19:33,976
你想吃玉米片吗?哦,不。
You want some nachos? Uh, no.

1120
01:19:34,079 --> 01:19:35,287
是的，我要尝尝。
Yeah, I'll try some.

1121
01:19:38,428 --> 01:19:40,051
你知道，我很好。
You know, I'm good.

1122
01:19:50,751 --> 01:19:52,246
每个人都在哪里?我们应该打赌的。
Where is everyone? We're supposed to be betting.

1123
01:19:52,270 --> 01:19:56,550
老兄,这是结束了。没人想再这么做了。
Dude, it's over. Nobody wants to do it anymore.

1124
01:19:56,653 --> 01:19:58,034
什么?为什么?我们赢了。
What? Why? We're winning.

1125
01:19:58,138 --> 01:20:00,692
不。我们是混蛋。
No. We're assholes.

1126
01:20:00,796 --> 01:20:03,005
这对任何人都没用，除了你。
And that doesn't work for anybody but you.

1127
01:20:04,834 --> 01:20:07,216
很好。我自己来做。
Fine. I'll do it on my own.

1128
01:20:27,408 --> 01:20:28,824
这太疯狂了。
It's gonna be insane.

1129
01:20:29,445 --> 01:20:30,826
疯了。
Crazy.

1130
01:20:30,929 --> 01:20:34,899
我告诉过你我们应该…你买椒盐脆饼了吗?-是的。
I told you we should have... Did you get the pretzels?- Yeah.

1131
01:20:39,144 --> 01:20:41,422
这是给你的。谢谢你！
This just came for you. Thank you.

1132
01:20:41,526 --> 01:20:43,183
哦。最后。
Oh. Finally.

1133
01:20:44,391 --> 01:20:45,633
薪水吗?
Paycheck?

1134
01:20:45,737 --> 01:20:48,188
好像我会为此感到兴奋似的。
Like I'd get excited about that.

1135
01:20:48,291 --> 01:20:51,570
不。州彩票委员会。
No. State lottery commission.

1136
01:20:51,674 --> 01:20:56,334
他们不想跟我谈，但任何赢了6万以上的人都会被载入公共记录。
They don't want to talk to me, but anybody that wins above 60,000 is in the public record.

1137
01:20:56,437 --> 01:20:58,129
你只需要提交一个请求。
You just have to submit a request.

1138
01:20:58,232 --> 01:21:02,409
过去六个月的每一幅画我都画了。
Which I did, for every drawing in the last six months.

1139
01:21:03,479 --> 01:21:07,069
杰拉德·塞尔比，每三周。
Gerald Selbee, every three weeks.

1140
01:21:10,106 --> 01:21:11,106
嗯。
Mmm-hmm.

1141
01:21:11,832 --> 01:21:13,213
泰勒朗格弗德。
Tyler Langford.

1142
01:21:15,318 --> 01:21:16,423
相同的图纸。
Same drawings.

1143
01:21:17,493 --> 01:21:18,839
有另一个。
There's another one.

1144
01:21:21,221 --> 01:21:22,878
嗯。
Huh.

1145
01:21:22,981 --> 01:21:27,606
泰勒朗格弗德。泰勒朗格弗德。
Tyler Langford. Tyler Langford.

1146
01:21:27,710 --> 01:21:30,713
好的，泰勒·兰福德，我看到你了。
Okay, Tyler Langford, I see you.

1147
01:21:33,440 --> 01:21:36,581
这是我花过的最好的一欧元。
Best euro I've ever spent.

1148
01:21:36,684 --> 01:21:38,203
谢谢,拉吉。——谢谢。
Thanks, Raj.- Thank you.

1149
01:21:38,307 --> 01:21:39,308
好吧,女孩。
Okay, girl.

1150
01:21:44,244 --> 01:21:45,693
该死的!——哇!
Darn!- Whoa!

1151
01:21:45,797 --> 01:21:47,385
再试一次，亲爱的。
Try one more time, sweetheart.

1152
01:21:47,488 --> 01:21:48,973
像袋鼠一样。
Like a kangaroo.

1153
01:21:49,076 --> 01:21:51,389
嘿，你能给我一个一千万吗?是的。
Hey, would you hand me a 10 mil? Yeah.

1154
01:21:53,253 --> 01:21:54,771
10毫升。
Ten mil.

1155
01:21:55,496 --> 01:21:56,808
给你。谢谢你！
Here you go. Thank you.

1156
01:21:56,912 --> 01:21:58,672
你都不给自己买辆新卡车吗?
You won't even buy yourself a new truck?

1157
01:21:58,775 --> 01:22:00,398
不。这个作品。
Nah. This one works.

1158
01:22:00,501 --> 01:22:01,778
不是吗?
Does it?

1159
01:22:01,882 --> 01:22:04,885
不是一直都是这样。但我想这就是我喜欢它的原因。
Not all the time. But I think that's why I like it.

1160
01:22:04,989 --> 01:22:05,989
嗯。
Hmm.

1161
01:22:06,749 --> 01:22:08,026
你知道吗?
You know what?

1162
01:22:09,200 --> 01:22:10,511
我确实买了这个。
I did buy this.

1163
01:22:16,483 --> 01:22:21,867
我和你一起数镍币是因为我能理解。
I counted nickels with you because it was something I understood.

1164
01:22:23,973 --> 01:22:27,701
我不知道还有什么更好的方式和你共度时光。
I didn't know a better way to spend time with you.

1165
01:22:27,804 --> 01:22:29,806
我只知道我想这么做。
I just knew that I wanted to.

1166
01:22:34,915 --> 01:22:36,399
你知道是怎么回事吗?
You know how it works?

1167
01:22:36,503 --> 01:22:44,373
我假设你创造了自旋，这样它就有了第三个轴，这样风就可以抵消重力。
Well, I assume you create spin, which gives it a third axis, so that the wind can offset the gravity.

1168
01:22:45,995 --> 01:22:48,066
是的,就是这样。就像这样。
Yeah, that's it. Just like that.

1169
01:22:50,620 --> 01:22:52,277
想要验证这个理论吗?
Wanna test that theory?

1170
01:22:52,381 --> 01:22:53,416
好吧。
All right.

1171
01:22:53,520 --> 01:22:55,073
手指放在鞋带上。
Fingers on the laces.Yeah.

1172
01:22:57,973 --> 01:22:59,388
哦,好吧。不坏。
Oh, well. Not bad.

1173
01:22:59,491 --> 01:23:02,356
我会解决的。我知道你会的。
I'll work it out. I know you will.

1174
01:23:03,737 --> 01:23:06,050
哦,就是这样。——Selbee先生吗?
Oh, that's it.- Mr. Selbee?

1175
01:23:06,912 --> 01:23:09,122
玛雅可要注意了。波士顿环球报。
Maya Jordon. Boston Globe.

1176
01:23:10,571 --> 01:23:14,334
我想问你一些关于GS投资策略的问题。
I'd like to ask you some questions about GS Investment Strategies.

1177
01:23:16,508 --> 01:23:22,928
你和你妻子在酒店房间里数了11天的票?
So, you and your wife count tickets in a hotel room for 11 days?

1178
01:23:23,032 --> 01:23:24,068
是的。
Yup.

1179
01:23:25,931 --> 01:23:28,555
工作量太大了。
That's so much work.

1180
01:23:30,419 --> 01:23:31,799
嗯。
Mmm.

1181
01:23:31,903 --> 01:23:34,319
这看起来不像是工作。
It doesn't seem like work.

1182
01:23:34,423 --> 01:23:36,425
我一生都在工作。
I've worked all my life.

1183
01:23:37,288 --> 01:23:39,014
这是不同的。
This is different.

1184
01:23:40,463 --> 01:23:42,431
这是非常不同的。
This is very different.

1185
01:23:56,652 --> 01:23:58,481
你寄过去了吗?
You send it in yet?

1186
01:23:58,585 --> 01:24:00,587
他们帮助了整个小镇。
They helped their entire town.

1187
01:24:01,657 --> 01:24:03,107
问题不在于故事本身。
The flaw isn't the story.

1188
01:24:03,210 --> 01:24:05,350
这可不是什么吹捧的文章。
Well, this can't be a puff piece.

1189
01:24:05,902 --> 01:24:07,214
我需要一个头条新闻。
I need a headline.

1190
01:24:17,845 --> 01:24:20,296
啊。
Ah.

1191
01:24:20,400 --> 01:24:25,612
如果我们做得很好，我们就不需要这个游戏了。
Well, we do well on this one, we won't need the game anymore.

1192
01:24:25,715 --> 01:24:31,721
你知道吗，我在想，如果我们要为小镇建立一个基金，管理它，就得全职工作了。
You know, I was thinking, if we're going to have a fund for the town, managing it, it's gonna be a full-time job.

1193
01:24:31,825 --> 01:24:38,487
嗯…你觉得我们能在市中心弄间办公室吗，像史蒂夫的那样?
Well... Hey, you think we can get one of those offices downtown, like Steve's?

1194
01:24:38,590 --> 01:24:40,144
什么?
What?

1195
01:24:40,247 --> 01:24:42,146
我已经在他旁边买了一个了。
I already got us one right next to his.

1196
01:24:42,249 --> 01:24:43,802
你做了吗?是的!
You did? Yes!

1197
01:24:43,906 --> 01:24:47,116
事实上，他的克尔维特就停在我们的一个停车位上。
In fact, his Corvette is actually in one of our parking spots.

1198
01:24:47,220 --> 01:24:49,222
好吧，我们得处理一下。
Well, we'll have to take care of that.

1199
01:24:49,325 --> 01:24:51,810
什么?他们要把WinFall的机器搬出去。
What? They're moving out the WinFall machine.

1200
01:24:51,914 --> 01:24:53,329
嘿,嘿!嘿。嘿!
Hey, hey! Hey. Hey!

1201
01:24:55,849 --> 01:24:59,749
嘿。比尔!比尔,发生了什么事?
Hey. Bill! Bill, what happened?

1202
01:24:59,853 --> 01:25:01,820
彩票吊销了我们的执照。
The lottery suspended our license.

1203
01:25:01,924 --> 01:25:04,064
为什么?你没看到那篇文章吗?
Why? You didn't see the article?

1204
01:25:08,275 --> 01:25:09,483
哦。
Oh.

1205
01:25:17,905 --> 01:25:20,149
嘿,哥们。学校怎么样?哦,爸爸。
Hey, buddy. How's school? Uh, Dad.

1206
01:25:20,253 --> 01:25:22,255
你在这里做什么?你是著名的。
What are you doing here? You're famous.

1207
01:25:24,602 --> 01:25:26,224
伟大的举动,天才。
Great move, genius.

1208
01:25:26,328 --> 01:25:28,640
我们走吧。收拾好你的东西。你回家。
Let's go. Pack up your stuff. You're coming home.

1209
01:25:29,814 --> 01:25:31,126
现在。
Now.

1210
01:25:33,921 --> 01:25:40,273
大量投注的集团发现了游戏中的一个漏洞，并利用它获利数百万美元。
The high-volume betting groups discovered a flaw in the game and took advantage of it, to the tune of millions of dollars.

1211
01:25:40,376 --> 01:25:46,693
彩票官员对这一发现表示惊讶，并宣布他们将在今晚开奖后逐步取消这项比赛。
Lottery officials expressed their surprise at the discovery and announced they will phase out the game after tonight's drawing.

1212
01:25:46,796 --> 01:25:52,595
继续我们的下一个…最后一卷是今天。你本可以赢得最后的胜利。
Moving on to our next... The last roll down was today. You could've gotten your final win.

1213
01:25:55,184 --> 01:26:01,294
是的。但即使我们找到一个地方打赌，感觉也不会一样了。
Yes. But even if we found a place to bet, it wouldn't have felt the same.

1214
01:26:05,056 --> 01:26:07,645
对他来说，这不仅仅是一场游戏。
It was more than just a game to him.

1215
01:26:12,374 --> 01:26:15,687
他终于可以用他的天赋与人交流了。
He finally got to use his gift to connect to people.

1216
01:26:26,491 --> 01:26:27,491
杰里!
Jerry!

1217
01:26:28,597 --> 01:26:29,701
什么?
What?

1218
01:26:29,805 --> 01:26:33,636
股东们今晚要开会，我想知道你能不能过来一趟。
The shareholders are having a meeting tonight and were wondering if you could stop by.

1219
01:26:33,740 --> 01:26:34,948
他们是沮丧吗?
Are they upset?

1220
01:26:35,051 --> 01:26:37,088
如果我告诉你，你就不会来了。
If I told you that, you wouldn't come.

1221
01:26:40,264 --> 01:26:42,714
我试图在时事通讯上回答他们所有的问题。
I tried to answer all their questions in the newsletter.

1222
01:26:42,818 --> 01:26:44,854
我觉得他们不知道怎么打开通讯。
I don't think they know how to open the newsletter.

1223
01:26:44,958 --> 01:26:47,132
他们什么都不用担心。
Well, they don't have to worry about anything.

1224
01:26:47,236 --> 01:26:49,065
我们没有违反任何法律。
We didn't break any laws.

1225
01:26:52,345 --> 01:26:56,176
神圣的…这是爵士乐节?什么?
Holy... It's jazz fest? What?

1226

让我们这样做!
Let's do this!

1230
01:27:12,882 --> 01:27:15,851
是啊!好了,对吧?
Yeah! Okay, right?

1231

Jer and Marge!

1232
01:27:18,371 --> 01:27:22,167
你是怎么……我们错过了最后的演出。

1233
01:27:22,271 --> 01:27:23,617
哦，不，我们没有。
Oh, no, we did not.

1234
01:27:23,721 --> 01:27:26,206
是啊，每个人都抢了一间店，爸爸。整个州。
Yeah, everybody took a store, Dad. All across the state.

1235
01:27:26,310 --> 01:27:28,035
我们有一辆公共汽车和一切。
We had a bus and everything.

1236
01:27:28,139 --> 01:27:29,830
什么?哦。
What? Oh.

1237
01:27:29,934 --> 01:27:31,246
你不用这么做的。
You didn't have to do that.

1238
01:27:31,349 --> 01:27:33,386
你这么做是为了我们。我们为什么不帮你呢?
You did it for us. Why wouldn't we do it for you?

1239
01:27:33,489 --> 01:27:36,665
别担心，我们把计数的部分留给你们了。
And don't worry, we left you two the counting part.

1240
01:27:41,601 --> 01:27:43,361
嘿,拉吉!
Hey, Raj!

1241
01:27:43,465 --> 01:27:45,605
我想帮忙，但我不会数数。
I would help, but, uh, I can't count.

1242

是的,你可以。我可以计算。我只是不喜欢数。
Yes, you can. I can count. I just don't like to count.

1243
01:27:49,540 --> 01:27:52,543
这个小镇不只是报纸上的文章，杰瑞。是我们所有人。
This town isn't just a newspaper article, Jerry. It's all of us.

1244
01:27:52,646 --> 01:27:58,514
你在别人都做不到的时候让这个小镇起死回生，因为你不认为我们只是数字。
And you brought this town back from the dead when nobody else could, because you don't think we're just numbers.

1245
01:28:00,861 --> 01:28:02,277
不。不。
No. No.

1246
