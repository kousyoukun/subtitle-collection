1
00:00:33,933 --> 00:00:37,337
这是我的朋友，杰里和马吉·赛尔比。
BILL: These are my friends, Jerry and Marge Selbee.

2
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:44,411
他们住在密歇根的埃沃特。
They live in Evart, Michigan.

3
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:50,683
这是一个并非全盛时期的小镇。
It's a small town that's not exactly in its prime.

4
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:54,421
不过说实话，杰瑞和马姬也不是。
Though, to be honest, neither are Jerry and Marge.

5
00:00:55,789 --> 00:00:58,825
今天，他们正在去买彩票的路上。
Today, they're on their way to buy lottery tickets.

6
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:01,761
很多很多的彩票。
Lots and lots of lottery tickets.

7
00:01:01,828 --> 00:01:02,996
(笑)
(LAUGHS)

8
00:01:03,062 --> 00:01:04,798
比尔:但是他们不希望运气好。
BILL: But they're not hoping to get lucky.

9
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:08,601
你看，他们不需要运气。
You see, they don't need luck.

10
00:01:17,076 --> 00:01:19,412
但故事并不是从这里开始的。
But this story doesn't start there.

11
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:21,981
从杰瑞开始，
It starts with Jerry,

12
00:01:22,048 --> 00:01:27,086
42年来他每天都在黎明前起床，
getting up before dawn just like he has every day for 42 years,

13
00:01:27,153 --> 00:01:29,489
去玉米片厂工作
going to work at the Corn Flakes factory,

14
00:01:29,556 --> 00:01:33,092
因为他担心这将是最后一次。
for what he fears will be the last time.

15
00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:35,662
杰瑞:这其实是个数学问题。
JERRY: It's a math problem, really.

16
00:01:35,728 --> 00:01:38,431
如果你数一下字母
If you count the letters, uh,

17
00:01:38,498 --> 00:01:40,300
除了他们跳过的字母“I”
except the letter "I," which they skip

18
00:01:40,366 --> 00:01:42,168
因为它看起来像“1”，
because it looks like a "1",

19
00:01:42,235 --> 00:01:46,172
那你就会意识到J是二月
then you realize that "J" is February.

20
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:48,875
然后，最后一个字母……
And then, the last letter...

21
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:50,343
哦,男孩。(温柔的笑)
Oh, boy. (CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

22
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:52,011
它指定了植物代码，
That designates the plant code,

23
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:54,848
这很不容易理解，但是…
which was not easy to figure out, but, uh...

24
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:57,851
我做到了。
I did.

25
00:01:59,919 --> 00:02:01,621
杰瑞,
Jerry,

26
00:02:01,688 --> 00:02:03,790
你不需要那么努力工作。你退休。
you don't have to work so hard. You're retiring.

27
00:02:03,857 --> 00:02:05,325
(笑)
(ALL LAUGH)

28
00:02:05,391 --> 00:02:06,826
嗯,是的。但是…我…
Well, yeah. But... I...

29
00:02:06,893 --> 00:02:09,229
我不需要这样。嗯…
I don't have to be. Um...

30
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:12,332
我知道我的电话挂断了，但是…
I know my line is shutting down, but...

31
00:02:12,398 --> 00:02:14,534
你知道的，我对数字有一种情结。
You know, I have a thing with numbers.

32
00:02:14,601 --> 00:02:16,069
来吧。
Come on.

33
00:02:16,135 --> 00:02:19,572
你已经服完刑了。这是你的黄金岁月。
You've served your time. These are your golden years.

34
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:22,642
他是我们最好的部门经理，对吧?
He's the best line manager we ever had, right?

35
00:02:22,709 --> 00:02:23,977
绝对的。
Absolutely.

36
00:02:24,043 --> 00:02:26,279
男:嗨。你为什么不告诉他们
MAN: Hey. Why don't you tell these guys

37
00:02:26,346 --> 00:02:28,448
你高中时怎么开始在这里工作的?
how you started working here in high school?

38
00:02:29,349 --> 00:02:31,918
你上夜班，对吧?
You worked nights, right?

39
00:02:42,962 --> 00:02:44,197
(玻璃无比的)
(GLASS CLINKING)

40
00:02:44,264 --> 00:02:45,565
(聊天)
(PEOPLE CHATTERING)

41
00:02:46,432 --> 00:02:48,167
霍华德:杰瑞。道格:好吧。
HOWARD: To Jerry. DOUG: All right.

42
00:02:48,234 --> 00:02:50,870
不是每个人都能活到42岁
Not everybody can pull off 42 years

43
00:02:50,937 --> 00:02:52,372
没有被解雇。(笑)
without getting fired. (ALL LAUGH)

44
00:02:52,438 --> 00:02:55,208
现在你的老板会让你睡个懒觉。
And now you have a boss who's going to let you sleep in.

45
00:02:55,808 --> 00:02:57,310
也不会对我大吼大叫。
And won't yell at me.

46
00:02:57,377 --> 00:02:58,645
错误的。哦。
Wrong about that. Oh.

47
00:02:58,711 --> 00:03:00,179
(笑着说)
(ALL LAUGHING)

48
00:03:00,246 --> 00:03:02,315
你知道吗，你应该去拿你的房地产执照，
You know, you should get your real estate license,

49
00:03:02,382 --> 00:03:03,983
就像霍华德那样
just like Howard did.

50
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:05,151
这就像有一份工作。
It's like having a job.

51
00:03:05,218 --> 00:03:06,986
但这就像退休一样，
But it's also like being retired,

52
00:03:07,053 --> 00:03:08,821
因为你什么都不做。
because you don't do anything.

53
00:03:08,888 --> 00:03:10,223
(众人笑)这是真的。
(ALL LAUGH) It's true.

54
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:11,891
大多数时候，我都不出家门。
Most days, I don't even leave the house.

55
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:13,927
嗯…
Well...

56
00:03:13,993 --> 00:03:15,628
你知道，我会成功的。
You know, I'll make it work.

57
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:18,398
你知道，我总能帮马姬做家务。
You know, I can always help Marge around the house.

58
00:03:18,464 --> 00:03:20,166
不，你不需要这么做。
No, you don't need to do that.

59
00:03:20,233 --> 00:03:21,568
不，我很乐意。
No, I'd be happy to.

60
00:03:21,634 --> 00:03:23,937
我是说，你照顾这个地方这么多年了。
I mean, you've been taking care of this place for years.

61
00:03:24,003 --> 00:03:25,238
我有一个系统。
I kind of have a system.

62
00:03:25,305 --> 00:03:26,839
是啊，而且还不错。
Oh, yeah, and a good one.

63
00:03:26,906 --> 00:03:29,742
但是，你知道，每个系统都可以改进。
But, you know, every system can use an improvement.

64
00:03:29,809 --> 00:03:30,910
道格:哦,上帝。我们开始吧。
DOUG: Oh, God. Here we go.

65
00:03:30,977 --> 00:03:32,345
嘿。我有个主意。是吗?
Hey. I got an idea. Yeah?

66
00:03:32,412 --> 00:03:35,481
为什么不让我去你们的一些工作网站做咨询呢?
Why don't I try consulting on some of your job sites?

67
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:38,084
你知道的，想办法让事情做得更好。啊。
You know, find ways of making things run better. Ah.

68
00:03:38,151 --> 00:03:40,420
你想在我的建筑工地闲逛
You wanna walk around on my construction site

69
00:03:40,486 --> 00:03:42,855
告诉我我做错了什么现钞。
and tell me what I'm doing wrong? Oof.

70
00:03:42,922 --> 00:03:44,023
我不会要价太高的。
I wouldn't charge much.

71
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:45,358
我还得付钱给你吗?
Oh, and I have to pay you for this?

72
00:03:45,425 --> 00:03:46,726
该死的正确的。你也会来吗
Darn right. DOUG: Are you going to also come by

73
00:03:46,793 --> 00:03:49,262
然后教我妻子批改论文吗?(笑)
and teach my wife how to grade papers? (ALL CHUCKLE)

74
00:03:49,329 --> 00:03:51,698
嘿，爸爸，如果我住在这里，我会很高兴的。
Hey, Dad, if I lived here, I would welcome that.

75
00:03:51,764 --> 00:03:53,199
谢谢你,黎明。
Thank you, Dawn.

76
00:03:53,266 --> 00:03:54,434
我要接受你的建议。
I'm gonna take you up on that.

77
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,769
我以后要经常开车去大急流城。
I'm gonna drive down to Grand Rapids more often.

78
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:58,438
哦,哎呀。
Oh, whoops.

79
00:03:58,504 --> 00:03:59,505
你卖得太好了。
You sold it too well.

80
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:00,807
闭嘴。结果却适得其反。
Shut up. Backfired right in your face.

81
00:04:00,873 --> 00:04:01,874
是的,亲爱的?好吧。
Yeah, sweetie? Okay.

82
00:04:01,941 --> 00:04:03,176
我们能给爷爷看吗?
Can we show Pop Pop?

83
00:04:03,242 --> 00:04:05,812
你想现在就给爷爷看吗?
Uh, yeah, you wanna show Pop Pop right now?

84
00:04:05,878 --> 00:04:06,913
给我看什么?
Show me what?

85
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:09,716
我们给你准备了退休礼物。女:惊喜。
We got you a retirement present. WOMAN: Surprise.

86
00:04:09,782 --> 00:04:11,618
好吧。
Okay.

87
00:04:11,684 --> 00:04:13,252
睁开你的眼睛。丽萃:开放。
Open your eyes. LIZZY: Open.

88
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:15,054
杰瑞:不会吧!
JERRY: Holy cow!

89
00:04:15,121 --> 00:04:16,255
(笑)
(ALL LAUGH)

90
00:04:16,322 --> 00:04:19,292
一艘渔船。什么……
A fishing boat. What...

91
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:22,328
我喜欢钓鱼吗?我该怎么办?好吧。是的，你带过我一次。
Do I like fishing? I do? Okay. Yeah, you took me once.

92
00:04:22,395 --> 00:04:23,930
现在你想什么时候走都可以了。
Yeah, now you can go whenever you want.

93
00:04:23,997 --> 00:04:25,498
杰瑞:是啊，怎么样?
JERRY: Yeah, how about that?

94
00:04:26,566 --> 00:04:28,401
这是伟大的。谢谢你！
This is great. Thank you.

95
00:04:28,468 --> 00:04:31,170
谢谢，谢谢，谢谢。黎明:哦,好。
Thank you, thank you, thank you. DAWN: Oh, good.

96
00:04:31,237 --> 00:04:32,472
(笑)哦。唐恩:爸爸喜欢它。
(LAUGHS) Oh. DAWN: Dad likes it.

97
00:04:32,538 --> 00:04:35,008
还有你，保守秘密。
And you, for keeping a secret.

98
00:04:36,509 --> 00:04:37,610
谢谢你,南瓜。
Thank you, pumpkin.

99
00:04:37,677 --> 00:04:38,878
谢谢你,道格。你喜欢它吗?
Thank you, Doug. You like it?

100
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:40,246
杰瑞:是啊。道格:好吧。
JERRY: Yeah. DOUG: All right.

101
00:04:40,713 --> 00:04:41,681
我的天啊。
My goodness.

102
00:04:41,748 --> 00:04:44,050
我的天啊。道格:好工作。你没有破坏它。
My goodness. DOUG: Good job. You didn't spoil it.

103
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:46,686
那是你唯一的工作。你做得很好。你没事吧?
DOUG: That was your one job. You did so good. You okay?

104
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:49,889
哦,是的。是的。
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

105
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:51,290
(笑)
(CHUCKLES)

106
00:04:54,227 --> 00:04:57,163
我没有很多普通的衣服。
I don't have many regular clothes.

107
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:59,132
都是工作服。
It's all work shirts.

108
00:04:59,198 --> 00:05:00,833
我们可以给你买更多衣服。
Well, we can get you more clothes.

109
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:01,901
嗯。
Hmm.

110
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:05,471
这需要调整。
It'll be an adjustment.

111
00:05:06,172 --> 00:05:07,407
你会找到路的。
You'll find your way.

112
00:05:07,907 --> 00:05:09,142
嗯。
Hmm.

113
00:05:09,208 --> 00:05:10,476
有你吗?
Have you?

114
00:05:10,543 --> 00:05:12,445
不是真的。但是我没有船。
Not really. But I don't have a boat.

115
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:16,482
你想要这个吗?
You want this one?

116
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:18,084
不。
Nope.

117
00:05:27,093 --> 00:05:29,362
(播放音乐)
(MUSIC PLAYING)

118
00:05:51,984 --> 00:05:54,020
早上,莱昂。早上好,杰里。
Morning, Leon. Morning, Jerry.

119
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:03,963
卡被拒绝了，海伦。我很抱歉。
Card was declined, Helen. I'm sorry.

120
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:07,667
海伦:(叹气)该死。也许我有现金。让我……
HELEN: (SIGHS) Dang it. Maybe I have cash. Let me just...

121
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:12,905
利昂:我知道你很能干。
LEON: I know you're good for it.

122
00:06:12,972 --> 00:06:14,107
海伦:谢谢你,莱昂。
HELEN: Thanks, Leon.

123
00:06:16,809 --> 00:06:17,877
(门关闭)
(DOOR CLOSES)

124
00:06:27,186 --> 00:06:29,021
你在这里做什么?
What are you doing out here?

125
00:06:29,088 --> 00:06:30,289
我的约会是10点。
My appointment is at 10: 00.

126
00:06:30,356 --> 00:06:32,158
不，你说你10点来的。
No, you said you'd come at 10: 00.

127
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:34,627
我没有其他预约。我有六个客户。
I don't have any other appointments. I have six clients.

128
00:06:34,694 --> 00:06:35,762
好吧。
Okay.

129
00:06:35,828 --> 00:06:38,131
只有六个客户，你怎么谋生?
How do you make a living with only six clients?

130
00:06:38,197 --> 00:06:41,968
我不喜欢。我刚成为一个在线旅行社。看到海报了吗?
I don't. I just became an online travel agent. See the posters?

131
00:06:42,869 --> 00:06:45,404
哦,是的。
Oh, yeah.

132
00:06:45,471 --> 00:06:49,175
既然都在网上了，为什么还需要海报呢?
So, why do you need posters if it's online?

133
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:50,910
因为它们是免费的。
Because they were free.

134
00:06:50,977 --> 00:06:54,113
为什么你总是要理解所有事情背后的原因?
Why do you always have to understand the reasoning behind everything?

135
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:55,348
哦,好吧。
Oh, well.

136
00:06:55,414 --> 00:06:57,950
只有这样我才能理清头绪。
It's the only way I can make sense of things.

137
00:06:59,118 --> 00:07:00,186
船怎么样了?
How's the boat?

138
00:07:01,053 --> 00:07:02,889
水还是太冷了。
Water's still too cold.

139
00:07:02,955 --> 00:07:06,192
你不下水。这就是这艘船的意义所在。
You don't get in the water. That's the point of the boat.

140
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:08,394
嗯。我的账户是怎么回事?
Hmm. How's my account?

141
00:07:08,461 --> 00:07:09,929
说到冷……
Speaking of cold...

142
00:07:11,898 --> 00:07:12,999
2%的涨幅,
2% gains,

143
00:07:13,065 --> 00:07:16,102
这听起来并不多，因为事实并非如此。
which doesn't sound like much, because it isn't.

144
00:07:16,169 --> 00:07:17,870
听着，你得更有攻击性。
Look, you gotta be more aggressive.

145
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:20,940
如果你让我投资股票，我可能会给你10%的收益。
If you let me put that in stocks, I could probably get you 10%.

146
00:07:21,007 --> 00:07:24,377
这只会让你的钱翻倍…
That would double your money in only...

147
00:07:24,443 --> 00:07:26,479
7.27年。
7.27 years.

148
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:30,883
这是我今天唯一一次可以用它。
Literally the only time I was going to get to use that today.

149
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:32,251
不。
Nope.

150
00:07:32,318 --> 00:07:33,786
这是我们的全部。
This is all we've got.

151
00:07:33,853 --> 00:07:35,521
我可不想拿它来赌博。
And I'm not about to gamble with it.

152
00:07:35,588 --> 00:07:37,924
这不是赌博。这似乎有风险，但市场……
It's not gambling. It seems like a risk, but the market...

153
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:41,928
是啊，如果你输了，那就是赌博。
Yeah, well, if you could lose it, it's gambling.

154
00:07:41,994 --> 00:07:43,696
我一个月后再打电话给你预约。
I'll call you in a month for my next appointment.

155
00:07:43,763 --> 00:07:45,531
不需要预约。好吧。
Don't need an appointment. Okay.

156
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:47,700
把船开出去。
Take out the boat.

157
00:07:48,768 --> 00:07:50,469
杰瑞:我可能会这么做。
JERRY: I may just do that.

158
00:08:19,799 --> 00:08:21,000
哦!
Oh!

159
00:08:23,369 --> 00:08:24,503
不。
No.

160
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:25,838
(发动机转速)
(ENGINE REVS)

161
00:08:34,247 --> 00:08:35,982
不会吧!
Holy cow!

162
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:46,893
莱昂:嘿,悲观主义者
LEON: Hey, Jer.

163
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:53,232
什么是roll down?利昂:就是头奖达到两百万的时候
WOMAN: What's a roll down? LEON: It's when the jackpot hits two million

164
00:08:53,299 --> 00:08:54,767
没有人得到6个数字。
and nobody gets six numbers.

165
00:08:54,834 --> 00:08:56,736
然后整个头奖就滚下来了
Then the whole jackpot rolls down

166
00:08:56,802 --> 00:08:58,871
对于得到三四个的人…
to the people who got three or four...

167
00:08:58,938 --> 00:09:00,239
无论什么。
Whatever.

168
00:09:00,306 --> 00:09:01,707
更好的机会。
Just better odds.

169
00:09:01,774 --> 00:09:03,809
祝你好运。是的。谢谢。
Good luck. Yeah. Thanks.

170
00:09:04,543 --> 00:09:05,978
利:更好的几率。
LEON: Better odds.

171
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:07,179
(门关闭)
(DOOR CLOSES)

172
00:09:35,341 --> 00:09:36,776
(喃喃自语)
(MUTTERING)

173
00:09:57,697 --> 00:09:59,165
这是对的吗?
Can that be right?

174
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,134
好吧。
All right.

175
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:03,936
(低声说)
(MUTTERS)

176
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:12,278
这不是赌博。
It's not gambling.

177
00:10:12,345 --> 00:10:16,215
彩票吗?是的。每次都有赢的方法。
The lottery? Yup. There's a way to win every time.

178
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:17,316
你中风了吗?
Are you having a stroke?

179
00:10:17,383 --> 00:10:18,617
有一个漏洞
There's a loophole

180
00:10:18,684 --> 00:10:20,286
他们没看出来，而它就在数学里。
they didn't see, and it's right here in the math.

181
00:10:20,353 --> 00:10:22,288
现在，在一幅典型的画上，
Now, on a typical drawing,

182
00:10:22,355 --> 00:10:26,759
你有54分之一的机会打中6个数字中的3个，
you'd have a one in 54 chance of hitting three out of six numbers,

183
00:10:26,826 --> 00:10:30,262
一千五百分之一的几率击中四颗。
and a one in 1,500 chance of hitting four.

184
00:10:30,329 --> 00:10:31,731
很有可能你每次都输。
Odds are you'll lose every time.

185
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:32,898
不是每一次。
Not every time.

186
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:35,334
我上周赢了一张免费的票，结果输了。
I won a free ticket last week, which lost.

187
00:10:35,401 --> 00:10:37,370
但随着时间的推移，
But on the roll down weeks,

188
00:10:37,436 --> 00:10:39,238
支付给较低的数字
the payouts to the lower numbers

189
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:43,676
超过你需要支付的金额。
increases above the amount that you would pay to play.

190
00:10:43,743 --> 00:10:46,679
所以，数学对你有利。
So, the math is in your favor.

191
00:10:47,213 --> 00:10:48,014
他们错过了。
And they missed it.

192
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,949
史堤夫:我不知道这是什么意思。
STEVE: I don't know what this says.

193
00:10:50,016 --> 00:10:53,119
看起来像是一个疯子在牢房墙上画的数字。
Looks like the numbers a crazy man drew on his cell wall.

194
00:10:53,185 --> 00:10:54,787
这意味着在接下来的几个星期里，
It means that on the roll down weeks,

195
00:10:54,854 --> 00:10:56,455
你肯定会赢。
you're guaranteed to win.

196
00:10:56,522 --> 00:10:58,190
这不可能是真的。
That can't be true.

197
00:10:58,257 --> 00:11:01,460
为什么不呢?因为这是彩票，杰瑞。
Why not? Because it's the lottery, Jerry.

198
00:11:01,527 --> 00:11:02,995
底特律有一栋大楼
There's a building of people in Detroit

199
00:11:03,062 --> 00:11:06,132
他的工作就是知道这些数字是怎么运作的。他们做的事。
whose job it is to know how the numbers work. And they do.

200
00:11:07,433 --> 00:11:10,669
真不敢相信你是我的会计。
I cannot believe you are my accountant.

201
00:11:11,437 --> 00:11:12,571
兼职会计。
Part-time accountant.

202
00:11:12,638 --> 00:11:14,840
全职在线旅行社。
Full-time online travel agent.

203
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:24,417
嘿,明迪。
Hey, Mindy.

204
00:11:24,483 --> 00:11:26,385
嘿,杰瑞。存款?
Hey, Jerry. Making a deposit?

205
00:11:26,452 --> 00:11:28,421
哦,不…我…
Uh, no... I...

206
00:11:29,922 --> 00:11:32,458
我想取2000美元。
I'd like to withdraw $2,000.

207
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:34,126
是的。
Yep.

208
00:11:36,262 --> 00:11:38,064
你的脚怎么样了?
So, how are your feet?

209
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:39,498
是更好的。
Been better.

210
00:11:39,565 --> 00:11:40,966
滚动网球有帮助，
Rolling the tennis ball helped,

211
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:43,536
直到我的经理被它绊了一跤，把它扔到了街上。
until my manager tripped on it and threw it into the street.

212
00:11:43,602 --> 00:11:44,970
我可以再给您拿一份来。
I can bring you another one.

213
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:47,106
它们是三个一组的。谢谢。
They come in threes. Thanks.

214
00:11:51,644 --> 00:11:52,912
噢,谢谢你。
Oh, thank you.

215
00:11:52,978 --> 00:11:55,614
我过几天会带着押金回来。
I'll be back in a couple of days with a deposit.

216
00:11:55,681 --> 00:11:56,882
好吧。
Okay.

217
00:11:59,151 --> 00:11:59,952
哦。
Oh.

218
00:12:00,019 --> 00:12:03,322
可能比这个多20%
Probably be 20% more than this.

219
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:04,423
给予或获得。
Give or take.

220
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:05,825
到时候见。好吧。
See you then. Okay.

蚊:好的。祝你今天愉快。
MIDGE: Okay. Have a good day.

223
00:12:41,494 --> 00:12:43,429
两千张WinFall门票。
Two thousand WinFall tickets.

224
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:46,098
二千年?

225

是的,女士。
Yes, ma'am.

226

大家晚上好，欢迎参加本周的WinFall抽奖活动。
Good evening, folks, and welcome to this week's WinFall lottery roll down.

你没事吧?哦,是的。没有更好的。
You okay? Oh, yeah. Never better.

232
00:13:17,363 --> 00:13:19,131
电视播音员:四十三。那艘船怎么样了?
ANNOUNCER ON TV: Forty-three. So, how'd it go with the boat?

233
00:13:19,798 --> 00:13:21,100
哦,嗯…
Oh, uh...

234
00:13:21,167 --> 00:13:25,337
他们说他们能修好马达，但不是给我的。
They said they can fix the motor, but it's not for me.

235
00:13:25,404 --> 00:13:28,040
我是说，我们本来就应该一起做事的，对吧?
I mean, we're supposed to be doing stuff together anyway, right?

236
00:13:28,107 --> 00:13:29,775
电视播音员:三十一。

Oh... No, I didn't mean right now. ANNOUNCER ON TV: Ten.

239
00:13:36,782 --> 00:13:38,984
所以,什么时候?嗯，我不知道。
Well, so, when? Well, I don't know.

240
00:13:39,051 --> 00:13:40,553
我在看一个节目。
I'm watching a program.

241
00:13:41,453 --> 00:13:42,454
你看这个吗?
You're watching this?

250
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:29,868
问题是，没人知道这个小镇。
Problem is, nobody knows about this town.

251
00:14:29,935 --> 00:14:33,639
埃沃特应该开始以一美元的价格出售房子，就像托斯卡纳那样。
Evart should start selling houses for a dollar, like they do in Tuscany.

252
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:35,241
吸引人。

霍华德:不，比那多一点。
HOWARD: No, a little more than that.

257
00:14:41,914 --> 00:14:43,482
杰瑞，一欧元多少钱?
Jerry, how much is a Euro?

258
00:14:47,453 --> 00:14:48,454

260
00:14:51,357 --> 00:14:52,358
对不起。
Sorry.

261
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:55,094
嗯。
Mmm.

262

浪漫满屋。
Full house.

263
00:14:57,963 --> 00:14:59,465
我们在玩杜松子酒。
We're playing gin.

264
00:14:59,531 --> 00:15:00,966
哦。
Oh.

269
00:15:14,346 --> 00:15:15,981
杰里:杜松子酒，扑克，纸牌，
JERRY: Gin, or poker, or cribbage,

270
00:15:16,048 --> 00:15:17,950
我对它们都感到困惑。霍华德:你才不在乎呢。你不在乎。
I get confused by them all. HOWARD: You don't care. You don't care.

271
00:15:18,017 --> 00:15:20,252
拼字游戏。拼字游戏。(JERRY笑)
Scrabble. Scrabble next. (JERRY LAUGHS)

272
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:21,453
好吧,晚上。
All right, night.

273
00:15:23,322 --> 00:15:25,557
你得告诉我发生了什么事。
You're going to have to tell me what's going on.

274
00:15:25,624 --> 00:15:27,559
我太老了，等不及了。
I'm too old to wait it out.

275
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:31,964
哦……
Oh...

276
00:15:33,699 --> 00:15:35,367
我错过了机会。
I missed my chance.

277
00:15:37,836 --> 00:15:39,538
我做了我该做的一切。
I did everything I was supposed to do.

278
00:15:40,205 --> 00:15:41,607
我必须做的一切。
Everything I had to do.

00:15:43,075 --> 00:15:45,511
现在再做别的都太晚了。
Now it's too late to do anything else.

280
00:15:46,545 --> 00:15:49,615

282
00:15:54,386 --> 00:15:56,322
每个人似乎都这么认为。
Everybody seems to think it is.

283
00:15:56,722 --> 00:15:57,956
嗯…
Well...

284
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:02,061
见鬼，我什么都能做。
Heck, I can do anything.

285
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:04,963
如果他们不切断我的生产线，我现在还在工厂。
I'd still be at the factory if they didn't cut my line.

286
00:16:06,899 --> 00:16:08,434
而是……
But instead...

287
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:12,638
这是我的黄金岁月。
These are my golden years.

288
00:16:12,705 --> 00:16:15,741
是啊，就因为事情没有如你所愿，
Yeah, just because things didn't work out the way you wanted,

289
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:17,743
不代表他们不会。
doesn't mean they won't.

290

什么?
What?

祝你好运，和坏运气一样吗?
Good luck, it happens same as bad?

294
00:16:30,422 --> 00:16:33,325
是的。这只是数学。是的。(笑)
Yeah. It's just math. Yeah. (LAUGHS)

295
00:16:33,392 --> 00:16:36,528
什么?哦,男人。什么是假。
What? Oh, man. What a dummy.

296
00:16:37,596 --> 00:16:38,864
不是你。我。
Not you. Me.

297
00:16:38,931 --> 00:16:41,200
你是一个天才。(笑)
You're a genius. (LAUGHS)

298
00:16:43,035 --> 00:16:44,536
样本大小。(喘息)
Sample size. (GASPS)

299
00:16:44,603 --> 00:16:46,171
(笑)
(BOTH LAUGH)

300
00:16:46,238 --> 00:16:48,507
这就是我的错误所在。
That is where I went wrong.

301
00:16:48,574 --> 00:16:52,111
我没有计算概率的频率。
I didn't calculate the frequency of probability.

302
00:16:52,578 --> 00:16:53,612
这只是数学。
It's just math.

303
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:55,514
哦，我不喜欢数学。
Oh, I don't like math.

304
00:16:55,581 --> 00:16:57,549
哦。哦,我很抱歉。
Oh. Oh, I'm sorry.

305
00:16:57,616 --> 00:17:00,719
来，我给你看看……
Here, let me show you...

306
00:17:00,786 --> 00:17:02,988
在这里。如果你拿一枚硬币
Here. So, if you take a coin

307
00:17:03,055 --> 00:17:05,290
然后你把它抛了1000次，
and you flipped it 1,000 times,

308
00:17:05,357 --> 00:17:08,494
你仍然可能得到60%正面。
you might still get 60% heads.

309
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:15,033
但如果你投掷5000次，概率会接近50%
But if you flipped it 5,000 times, the probability gets closer to 50%.

310
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:19,204
样本必须足够大，才能把运气排除在外。
The sample has to be large enough to take luck out of the equation.

311
00:17:19,271 --> 00:17:22,207
(咂咂舌头)这是给你的。
(CLICKS TONGUE) And this is for you.

312
00:17:23,008 --> 00:17:25,611
你存一分钱吗?
Are you depositing a penny?

313
00:17:25,677 --> 00:17:28,380
(笑)。不。
(CHUCKLES) No. No.

314
00:17:28,747 --> 00:17:29,748
不。嗯…
No. Uh...

315
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:32,484
我想取钱。
I wanna make a withdrawal.

316
00:17:33,051 --> 00:17:35,621
4200美元。
$4,200.

317
00:17:37,256 --> 00:17:39,024
那我们还剩多少钱?
Oh, and how much does that leave us with?

318
00:17:39,091 --> 00:17:41,293
我检查。
I am checking.

319
00:17:43,595 --> 00:17:45,297
4点多一点。
A little over four.

320
00:17:45,697 --> 00:17:46,698
好吧。
Okay.

321
00:17:49,768 --> 00:17:51,503
那就6个吧。
Make it six, then.

322
00:17:52,638 --> 00:17:53,639
六个?嗯。
Six? Mmm-hmm.

323
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:03,682
(点击舌头)八?
(CLICKS TONGUE) Eight?

324
00:18:05,617 --> 00:18:06,752
八?8000美元。
Eight? $8,000.

325
00:18:07,619 --> 00:18:08,587
你确定吗?嗯。
Are you sure? Hmm.

326
00:18:11,824 --> 00:18:12,991
杰瑞:九十八。
JERRY: Ninety-eight.

327
00:18:13,058 --> 00:18:14,359
(机器开始震动)
(MACHINE WHIRS)

328
00:18:17,162 --> 00:18:18,664
杰瑞:九十九。
JERRY: Ninety-nine.

329
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:22,401
八千年。
Eight thousand.

330
00:18:24,736 --> 00:18:25,838
谢谢你,蚊。
Thank you, Midge.

331
00:18:26,505 --> 00:18:27,539
好了。
There we go.

332
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:28,607
再见。
Bye-bye.

333
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:32,778
霍华:你知道，每个城镇都有自己的特色。
HOWARD: You know, every town has a thing.

334
00:18:32,845 --> 00:18:34,179
我们需要一个东西。
We need a thing.

335
00:18:34,246 --> 00:18:36,048
爵士音乐节怎么了?
What happened to jazz fest?

336
00:18:36,114 --> 00:18:38,617
我们没法让舞台保持正常。
Well, we couldn't keep the stage up to code.

337
00:18:38,684 --> 00:18:41,019
有个穿木屐的女孩正好掉进去了。
Oh, one of those clogger girls fell right through.

338
00:18:41,086 --> 00:18:42,421
哦,是的。
Oh, yeah.

339
00:18:42,488 --> 00:18:43,789
雪莉:爵士音乐节也能赚钱。
SHIRLEY: Jazz fest made money, too.

340
00:18:43,856 --> 00:18:46,725
我是说，不是那一年，因为那女孩起诉了我们。是的。
I mean, not that year, because the girl sued us. Yeah.

341
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:49,161
她很生气，因为我们还在鼓掌。
She was upset 'cause we were still clapping.

342
00:18:49,228 --> 00:18:51,196
我们以为这是表演的一部分。
We thought it was part of the show.

343
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:52,498
霍华德(笑):哦。
(LAUGHS) HOWARD: Oh.

344
00:18:52,564 --> 00:18:54,333
顺便说一句，我们几个人在集资
By the way, a bunch of us are pooling money

345
00:18:54,399 --> 00:18:56,401
今晚的彩票。
for the lottery tonight.

346
00:18:56,468 --> 00:18:58,971
他们在做滚下的事情，你可以赢得更多。
They're doing that roll down thing, where you can win more.

347
00:18:59,037 --> 00:19:02,040
我们不是买彩票的人。霍华德:这也许是最好的办法。
We're not lottery people. HOWARD: That's probably for the best.

348
00:19:02,107 --> 00:19:03,942
你知道，有些人能吹几千
You know, there are some people who blow thousands

349
00:19:04,009 --> 00:19:05,477
这些东西吗?(咳嗽)
on those things? (COUGHING)

350
00:19:05,544 --> 00:19:07,079
你对吧?霍华德:来了。
You all right? HOWARD: Here we go.

351
00:19:07,145 --> 00:19:08,447
有什么事吗?喝。雪莉:下错管道了。
What's the matter? Take the drink. SHIRLEY: Down the wrong pipe.

352
00:19:09,081 --> 00:19:10,182
吃得太快了。
Eating too fast.

353
00:19:10,249 --> 00:19:12,084
(清了清喉咙,咳嗽)
(COUGHS, CLEARS THROAT)

354
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:13,352
霍华德:是的。
HOWARD: Yeah.

355
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:17,489
哦。
Ooh.

356
00:19:19,024 --> 00:19:20,392
四。
Four.

357
00:19:22,628 --> 00:19:23,795
(喃喃自语)
(MUTTERING)

358
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:39,511
喔!
Whoo.

359
00:20:01,166 --> 00:20:02,734
史帝夫:我是说，就像普通的旅行社，
STEVE: I mean, it's like a regular travel agent,

360
00:20:02,801 --> 00:20:03,802
但这是在网上,
but it's online,

361
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:05,003
这样人们就可以像动物一样行事
so people can act like animals

362
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:06,204
当事情不成功的时候。
when something doesn't work out.

363
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:08,006
嘿，你应该去旅行。
Hey, you should be traveling.

364
00:20:08,073 --> 00:20:10,676
你和温蒂以前经常坐游轮回来
You and Wendy used to go on all these cruises and come back

365
00:20:10,742 --> 00:20:12,044
把所有东西都调到左舷和右舷。
and call everything port and starboard.

366
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:13,412
(笑)我甚至不知道哪个是哪个。
(CHUCKLES) I didn't even know which was which.

367
00:20:13,478 --> 00:20:15,480
这取决于你在哪个海洋上。
Depends which ocean you're on.

368
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:18,050
嗯。不。不。霍华德:没错。
Hmm. No. No. HOWARD: Yep.

369
00:20:18,116 --> 00:20:19,851
她会希望你开心的。
She'd want you to have fun.

370
00:20:19,918 --> 00:20:21,486
已经三年了。
It's been three years.

371
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:23,522
哦,小鬼。小鬼和汉堡。所有的吗?
Oh, brats. Brats and burgers. All?

372
00:20:23,589 --> 00:20:24,990
史堤夫:上面有奶酪。好吧。
STEVE: With cheese on it. Okay.

373
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:26,391
小鬼和…哦。霍华德:切达干酪吗?
Brats and... Oh. HOWARD: Cheddar?

374
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:28,327
道格，你能帮我看一下烤架吗?
Doug, would you watch the grill for a second?

375
00:20:28,393 --> 00:20:30,362
看到了吗?这是个好时机。嗯?
See? This is a good time. Huh?

376
00:20:30,429 --> 00:20:32,230
嗯。我跟你说了，开车去是值得的。
Mmm. I told you it'd be worth the drive.

377
00:20:32,297 --> 00:20:33,432
不，你说你不知道
No, you said you didn't know

378
00:20:33,498 --> 00:20:35,033
你还剩下多少个周末。
how many weekends you have left.

379
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:36,268
好吧,我不喜欢。
Well, I don't.

380
00:20:36,335 --> 00:20:39,471
(道恩嘲笑)是的，但是数学是有用的。
(DAWN SCOFFS) Yeah, but the math works.

381
00:20:39,538 --> 00:20:41,239
开两小时车，就能得到免费汉堡。
Drive for two hours, get a free burger.

382
00:20:41,306 --> 00:20:42,708
抵消了汽油的成本。
Offsets the cost of gas.

383
00:20:42,774 --> 00:20:44,076
我不吃肉，爸爸。
I don't eat meat, Dad.

384
00:20:44,142 --> 00:20:45,744
哦,对了。我去买鸡肉。
Oh, right. I'll get the chicken.

385
00:20:45,811 --> 00:20:47,079
不，那还是肉。
No, that's still meat.

386
00:20:47,145 --> 00:20:48,413
杰瑞:好吧。
JERRY: Okay.

387
00:20:49,047 --> 00:20:50,282
他是好的吗?
Is he okay?

388
00:20:50,349 --> 00:20:54,086
他只是不知道怎么表达"我想你"
He just doesn't know the formula for "I miss you."

389
00:20:54,152 --> 00:20:55,354
有你在的时候会更有趣。
It is more fun when you're here.

390
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:57,990
我知道，但你和爸爸，你们在一起会很开心的。
I know, but you and Dad, you gotta have fun together.

391
00:20:58,056 --> 00:20:59,124
是的。
Yeah.

392
00:20:59,191 --> 00:21:00,359
我知道你等了很长时间
I know you've waited a really long time

393
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:02,327
让他退休。我知道。
for him to retire. I know.

394
00:21:02,394 --> 00:21:04,630
我知道。我们需要努力。
I know. We need to work on it.

395
00:21:04,696 --> 00:21:07,899
我都不记得我们上次是什么时候…
I can't even remember the last time that we had...

396
00:21:07,966 --> 00:21:09,835
(低声说)你知道吗?什么?
(WHISPERS) You know? What?

397
00:21:09,901 --> 00:21:11,970
是的。哦，不，没关系。我不需要听你说……
Yeah. Oh, no, that's okay. I don't need to hear about...

398
00:21:12,704 --> 00:21:13,872
蜂蜜。
Honey.

399
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:15,273
我要去喝杯啤酒。
I'm gonna get a beer.

400
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:17,175
好吧?好吧。我们会解决的。
Okay? Okay. We'll work on it.

401
00:21:17,242 --> 00:21:19,211
反正我也在考虑。黎明:好的。
I'm thinking about it anyway. DAWN: Okay.

402
00:21:19,277 --> 00:21:20,612
我希望他会。
I wish he would.

403
00:21:21,647 --> 00:21:22,648
(对象重击声)
(OBJECT THUDS)

404
00:21:22,714 --> 00:21:23,815
哇。
Whoa.

405
00:21:24,316 --> 00:21:25,384
哇,哇,哇!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

406
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:28,153
不，丽萃，丽萃，丽萃!不不不，莉兹。
No, Lizzy, Lizzy, Lizzy! No, no, no, no, Liz.

407
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:30,222
我们不要……我们不要打开它。
Let's not... Let's not open that.

408
00:21:30,288 --> 00:21:32,658
为什么?我想要爆米花。我知道。我知道。
Why? I want the popcorn. I know. I know.

409
00:21:32,724 --> 00:21:35,827
但这…这爆米花太不新鲜了。啊。
But this... this popcorn's very stale. Ugh.

410
00:21:35,894 --> 00:21:37,796
我喜欢陈旧。
I like stale.

411
00:21:37,863 --> 00:21:40,932
但这里面全是糖。这对你没有好处。
Well, but this is full of sugar. It's no good for you.

412
00:21:40,999 --> 00:21:43,802
我看见你吃了七块奥利奥。
I saw you eat seven Oreos.

413
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:46,304
你想吃奥利奥吗?
You want an Oreo?

414
00:21:46,371 --> 00:21:47,906
你都吃了，爷爷。
You ate them all, Pop Pop.

415
00:21:49,341 --> 00:21:51,343
好吧。好吧。嗯…
Okay. All right. Uh...

416
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:53,679
等我一分钟。
Let me just have it for one minute.

417
00:21:53,745 --> 00:21:55,881
爷爷会还给你的。我保证。
Pop Pop will give it back to you. I promise.

418
00:21:55,947 --> 00:21:58,083
你现在相信爷爷了，对吧?
You trust Pop Pop now, right?

419
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:00,285
让我花一分钟。
Let me just take one minute.

420
00:22:00,352 --> 00:22:01,687
我马上就出去。
And I'll be right out.

421
00:22:16,234 --> 00:22:17,969
给你。
Here you go.

422
00:22:18,036 --> 00:22:20,305
接受。谢谢,流行流行。
Take. Thanks, Pop Pop.

423
00:22:21,239 --> 00:22:22,507
是的。
Yep.

424
00:22:27,813 --> 00:22:28,980
(金属刮)
(METAL SCRAPING)

425
00:22:39,958 --> 00:22:41,393
有什么想告诉我的吗?
Something you wanna tell me?

426
00:22:42,227 --> 00:22:43,695
什么?
What?

427
00:22:43,762 --> 00:22:44,796
储藏室。
The pantry.

428
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:51,703
我在买彩票。
I'm playing the lottery.

429
00:22:53,638 --> 00:22:55,774
我是说那袋空的奥利奥。
I meant the empty bag of Oreos.

430
00:22:59,745 --> 00:23:03,448
我在玩彩票，而且我要赢了。
I'm playing the lottery, and I'm winning.

431
00:23:03,515 --> 00:23:06,752
我算了一下，赢了一万五千美元。
I figured out the math, and I won $15,000.

432
00:23:06,818 --> 00:23:09,821
它被塞在磨砂迷你小麦盒子里。
It's stuffed inside the Frosted Mini-Wheats box.

433
00:23:10,956 --> 00:23:12,057
哇。
Wow.

434
00:23:17,829 --> 00:23:20,599
我给雪莉的彩票池捐了20美元。
I gave $20 to Shirley's lottery pool.

435
00:23:20,665 --> 00:23:23,001
我想现在没什么大不了的了。
I guess it's not such a big deal now.

436
00:23:25,203 --> 00:23:26,505
我…
I...

437
00:23:26,938 --> 00:23:28,440
我必须试一试。
I had to try it.

438
00:23:28,507 --> 00:23:31,209
我…我在游戏中发现了这个缺陷，
I... I found this flaw in the game,

439
00:23:31,276 --> 00:23:34,312
我必须弄清楚我的判断是否正确。
and I had to find out if I was right.

440
00:23:34,379 --> 00:23:36,114
那你为什么不直接告诉我?
Well, why didn't you just tell me?

441
00:23:36,815 --> 00:23:39,818
我…觉得自己很愚蠢。
I... felt silly.

442
00:23:39,885 --> 00:23:43,655
我们几乎没有足够的钱退休，而且……
We barely have enough money to retire on as it is, and...

443
00:23:44,289 --> 00:23:45,924
现在不是冒险的时候。
This is no time to risk it.

444
00:23:48,293 --> 00:23:50,028
是的,它是。什么?
Yes, it is. What?

445
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:51,229
是时候冒险了。
It's time to risk it.

446
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:52,597
因为现在我们输了
Because right now we're losing

447
00:23:52,664 --> 00:23:54,666
一些更重要的事情。
something that matters even more.

448
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:58,103
我等了四十年，只为我们俩，
I've waited 40 years for it to be just us,

449
00:23:58,170 --> 00:24:00,539
到目前为止，我们做得很糟糕。
and so far we kind of suck at it.

450
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:02,707
我们有危险。
We have Jeopardy.

451
00:24:02,774 --> 00:24:06,044
哦，这不是问题。杰里!
Oh, that's not a thing. Jerry!

452
00:24:06,111 --> 00:24:07,612
我想玩得开心。
I wanna have fun.

453
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,549
我想玩得开心。
I wanna have fun.

454
00:24:13,251 --> 00:24:16,221
我们做点蠢事吧。嗯?
Let's be a little stupid. Huh?

455
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:18,023
我们17岁就结婚了，
We got married when we were 17,

456
00:24:18,089 --> 00:24:19,825
所以我们知道怎么做。
so we know how to do it.

457
00:24:21,259 --> 00:24:22,494
嗯,这是真的。
Well, that's true.

458
00:24:23,595 --> 00:24:26,498
我们需要一些东西。
We need something for us.

459
00:24:27,365 --> 00:24:28,567
(笑)
(CHUCKLES)

460
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:30,802
我没想到会是买彩票，
I didn't think it would be playing the lottery,

461
00:24:30,869 --> 00:24:34,806
但如果能让我们有谈资，我愿意去抢银行。
but I'd rob a bank if it gave us something to talk about.

462
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:36,908
好吧。
Okay.

463
00:24:36,975 --> 00:24:40,245
15000美元?是的。
$15,000? Yep.

464
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:41,513
(笑)
(BOTH LAUGH)

465
00:24:43,014 --> 00:24:45,584
杰瑞:如果我们把一万五千美元全押上……
JERRY: If we bet the whole $15,000...

466
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:47,986
哦,我们应该。我们全押上吧。你认为呢?
Oh, we should. Let's bet it all. You think?

467
00:24:48,053 --> 00:24:51,156
是啊，因为我也这么想。它是正确的…
Yeah, 'cause I was thinking the same thing. It's right...

468
00:24:51,223 --> 00:24:53,158
不。不，不，不。
No. No, no, no, no.

469
00:24:53,225 --> 00:24:55,627
里昂，WinFall怎么了?
Leon, what happened to WinFall?

470
00:24:55,694 --> 00:24:57,762
哦,他们……他们逐步淘汰了它。
Oh, they... they phased it out.

471
00:24:57,829 --> 00:25:00,265
什么?它就这样消失了?
What? It's gone, just like that?

472
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:01,900
反正你也不玩，对吧?
You don't play anyway, do you?

473
00:25:01,967 --> 00:25:04,870
不。是啊，我想人们会
No. Yeah, well, I guess people will just

474
00:25:04,936 --> 00:25:07,205
现在必须在马萨诸塞州比赛了。
have to play the one in Massachusetts now.

475
00:25:09,641 --> 00:25:12,410
数学工作。你可以看到。你是一个会计。
The math works. You can see that. You're an accountant.

476
00:25:12,477 --> 00:25:14,012
是的。我的意思是……
Yeah. I mean...

477
00:25:14,079 --> 00:25:15,146
我是说，看起来是对的。
I mean, it looks right.

478
00:25:15,213 --> 00:25:16,514
马萨诸塞州也不远。
And Massachusetts isn't that far.

479
00:25:16,581 --> 00:25:20,352
不，如果我们的卡车不抛锚的话，大概只有10个小时的车程。
No, it's only about a 10-hour drive if our truck doesn't break down.

480
00:25:20,418 --> 00:25:22,287
如果有，我们就搭个便车。是的。
If it does, we'll get a ride. Yeah.

481
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:23,688
从谁?
From whom?

482
00:25:23,755 --> 00:25:25,857
卡车司机。是的，他们总是在寻找同伴。
Truckers. Yeah, they're always looking for company.

483
00:25:25,924 --> 00:25:28,193
谋杀。如果情况变得奇怪，我们就跳出去。
To murder. We'll jump out if it gets weird.

484
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:31,096
他们甚至不会知道我们有一大包现金。
And they won't even know that we have a duffle bag full of cash.

485
00:25:31,162 --> 00:25:33,431
是的，我们会把拉链拉上的。(JERRY笑)
Yeah, we'll keep that zipped up. (JERRY LAUGHS)

486
00:25:33,498 --> 00:25:35,967
好吧。好吧,什么?
All right. All right, what?

487
00:25:36,034 --> 00:25:37,135
我也在。
I'm in, too.

488
00:25:37,202 --> 00:25:39,170
你确定吗?史蒂夫:不。
You sure? STEVE: No.

489
00:25:39,237 --> 00:25:42,807
但管他呢?给我投1000。(笑)
But what the hell? Put me in for 1,000. (LAUGHS)

490
00:25:42,874 --> 00:25:44,910
我刚要取消一个游轮旅行。
I just got a cruise I gotta cancel now.

491
00:26:00,659 --> 00:26:02,894
杰瑞:嘿。哦。哦。我们的晚餐。
JERRY: Hey. Oh. Oh. Got our dinner.

492
00:26:02,961 --> 00:26:06,298
是的。我们需要三天的食物。
Yeah. We're going to need three days of food.

493
00:26:06,998 --> 00:26:07,866
哦。
Oh.

494
00:26:07,933 --> 00:26:10,035
我给我们找了个小镇玩。
And I found us a small town to play in.

495
00:26:10,568 --> 00:26:12,671
是的，保持安静。
Yeah, keep things quiet.

496
00:26:12,737 --> 00:26:15,006
就像我把车停在一个街区外
You know, like how I park a block away

497
00:26:15,073 --> 00:26:16,574
在一个不错的车库拍卖会上。
at a good garage sale.

498
00:26:16,641 --> 00:26:17,976
是吗?哦。移动。
Yeah? Oh. Move.

499
00:26:21,246 --> 00:26:23,481
你有业余无线电吗?什么?
You got a ham radio? What?

500
00:26:23,548 --> 00:26:25,483
业余无线电。我们要去一些死亡区。
Ham radio. We're gonna hit some dead zones.

501
00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:28,620
我想我可以去Ace…等一下。
I suppose I can go to Ace... Wait a minute.

502
00:26:28,687 --> 00:26:29,688
(抽屉关闭)
(DRAWER CLOSES)

503
00:26:29,754 --> 00:26:31,222
电池怎么样了?
How are we on batteries?

504
00:26:31,289 --> 00:26:33,558
嗯…我…
Uh... I...

505
00:26:33,625 --> 00:26:35,994
(打开抽屉)马姬:啊。
(OPENS DRAWER) MARGE: Ah.

506
00:26:36,061 --> 00:26:39,965
好吧。我们再去买一些吧。(笑)以防万一。
Okay. Let's get some more. (CHUCKLES) Just in case.

507
00:26:40,031 --> 00:26:42,100
感觉我们真的是在抢银行。
Feels like we really are robbing a bank.

508
00:26:42,167 --> 00:26:45,570
不。会更有趣的。你把。
Nah. It's gonna be more fun. You take that.

509
00:26:45,637 --> 00:26:47,405
给你钥匙。
Here are the keys.

510
00:26:47,472 --> 00:26:49,274
好吧。啊。
All right. Aah.

511
00:26:49,341 --> 00:26:51,576
我有优惠券。
I got the coupons.

512
00:26:51,643 --> 00:26:52,978
好吧。你抓住。
All right. You grab that.

513
00:26:53,044 --> 00:26:55,046
哦,现在呢?哦。
Oh, now? Oh.

514
00:26:55,113 --> 00:26:56,381
我们走吧。哦。
Let's go. Oh.

515
00:26:56,448 --> 00:26:58,383
我可以先穿衣服吗?
Can I get dressed first?

516
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:00,151
(播放欢快的歌)
(UPBEAT SONG PLAYING)

517
00:27:03,321 --> 00:27:05,623
嗯。喔!
Mmm. Whoo.

518
00:27:05,690 --> 00:27:07,058
你有饼干吗?
You have cookies?

519
00:27:12,530 --> 00:27:14,332
哦。
Ooh.

520
00:27:38,089 --> 00:27:40,759
(笑)
(LAUGHS)

521
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:49,701
(播放歌曲停止)
(SONG STOPS PLAYING)

522
00:27:50,869 --> 00:27:52,170
看起来不太像。
Doesn't look like much.

523
00:27:52,237 --> 00:27:55,306
我们只需要一台售票机，对吧?
Well, all we need is a ticket machine, right?

524
00:27:56,641 --> 00:27:58,109
(扬声器播放音乐)
(MUSIC PLAYING OVER SPEAKER)

525
00:28:00,945 --> 00:28:02,914
孩子，这可是买一送一的，
Hey, kid, those are buy one, get one free,

526
00:28:02,981 --> 00:28:04,616
因为它们太过时了。
'cause they're so out of date.

527
00:28:04,682 --> 00:28:06,017
他们从2013年开始,
They're from 2013,

528
00:28:06,084 --> 00:28:09,154
但它们还是会让你的嘴变蓝。
but they'll still turn your mouth blue.

529
00:28:11,022 --> 00:28:12,757
事实上，我要先去拿。
Actually, I'm gonna get them first.

530
00:28:12,824 --> 00:28:14,692
(叹气)我能为你做些什么?
(SIGHS) How can I help you?

531
00:28:14,759 --> 00:28:18,129
我们想买八千张《WinFall》的门票。
We'd like to buy 8,000 WinFall tickets.

532
00:28:20,065 --> 00:28:21,433
我先去找你。
BILL: I'm gonna get you first.

533
00:28:24,803 --> 00:28:26,271
这远远不够。(男孩笑)
No way is this enough. (BOY CHUCKLES)

534
00:28:27,605 --> 00:28:29,007
这绝对不够。
There's no way that was enough.

535
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:30,608
嗯…
Uh...

536
00:28:30,675 --> 00:28:33,144
八千张《WinFall》门票…
Eight thousand WinFall tickets is, like...

537
00:28:34,345 --> 00:28:36,214
29000美元。
$29,000.

538
00:28:36,281 --> 00:28:38,983
16000号。16000美元。
No. 16,000. $16,000.

539
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:41,853
这就是我们带来的。
And that is how much we brought.

540
00:28:43,721 --> 00:28:47,058
机器每小时打印1000张票，所以你要在这里待一整天。
Well, the machine prints 1,000 tickets an hour, so you'll be here all day.

541
00:28:47,125 --> 00:28:49,794
根据我的经验，在这里待一天太糟糕了。
And let me tell you from experience, being here all day sucks.

542
00:28:49,861 --> 00:28:50,895
玛姬(笑)
(MARGE CHUCKLES)

543
00:28:50,962 --> 00:28:52,330
因为我一整天都在这里。
Because I'm here all day.

544
00:28:54,032 --> 00:28:58,136
嗯,他是对的。需要8个小时。
Well, he's right. It's gonna take eight hours.

545
00:28:58,937 --> 00:29:00,772
我能做到。滚吧。
I can do it. Let's get rolling.

546
00:29:00,839 --> 00:29:04,776
你想我们吗?是的,来吧。我还有工作要做。
You want us? Yeah, come on. I got work to do.

547
00:29:04,843 --> 00:29:07,412
我很忙。你能给我们演示一下吗?
I'm busy. Well, can you show us how it works?

548
00:29:07,479 --> 00:29:08,880
你会想出办法的。
You'll figure it out.

549
00:29:08,947 --> 00:29:11,249
杰瑞:对不起，旅馆不太好。
JERRY: Sorry, the motel's not so great.

550
00:29:11,316 --> 00:29:13,585
马姬:镐和铲子。(笑)
MARGE: The Pick and Shovel. (LAUGHS)

551
00:29:13,651 --> 00:29:15,053
完美的名字。
Perfect name.

552
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,822
因为这是你挖坟墓所需要的。
Because it's what you need to dig a grave.

553
00:29:17,889 --> 00:29:20,625
哈。让我想起了我们的新婚之夜。
Hah. Reminds me of our wedding night.

554
00:29:20,692 --> 00:29:22,160
嗯?
Huh?

555
00:29:22,227 --> 00:29:25,530
我爸给了我足够的钱让我带你去舞会。
My dad gave me enough money to take you to the prom.

556
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:28,266
但我又想"见鬼，舞会午夜结束，
But then I thought, "Heck, the prom ends at midnight,

557
00:29:28,333 --> 00:29:30,902
但婚姻是永恒的。
"but a marriage, that lasts forever.

558
00:29:30,969 --> 00:29:32,570
“而且还便宜20美元。”
"And it's 20 bucks cheaper."

559
00:29:32,637 --> 00:29:35,106
你是在戴斯酒店度过的。
Which you spent on a Days Inn.

560
00:29:35,173 --> 00:29:37,976
哦，我们的蜜月。是的。
Oh, on our honeymoon. Yeah.

561
00:29:38,042 --> 00:29:41,846
我很高兴我们都疯了。
Well, I'm glad we're being crazy.

562
00:29:41,913 --> 00:29:43,982
如果有必要，我会睡在车里。
I'd sleep in the car if I had to.

563
00:29:44,048 --> 00:29:46,084
好吧，你可能不得不这么做。
Well, you may have to.

564
00:29:46,951 --> 00:29:48,620
我想这门锁不上。
I don't think this door locks.

565
00:29:48,686 --> 00:29:51,389
噢，开始了，杰瑞。哦，哦，哦，哦。
Oh, it's on, Jerry. Oh, oh, oh, oh.

566
00:29:55,126 --> 00:29:56,194
好吧。
All right.

567
00:29:57,595 --> 00:29:59,330
哦，你有…
Oh, you have the...

568
00:29:59,397 --> 00:30:02,500
交叉手指，我们最后一个幸运数字是21。
ANNOUNCER ON TV: Cross those fingers, our very last lucky number is 21.

569
00:30:02,567 --> 00:30:08,473
各位，这些数字，再来一次，是23 45 01 25 06和21。
Folks, those numbers, one more time, are 23, 45, 01, 25, 06 and 21.

570
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:11,309
好了，伙计们，检查一下这些数字。我们祝你好运。
All right, folks, check those numbers. We wish you the best of luck.

571
00:30:11,376 --> 00:30:13,678
希望这是你的一周。好吧。
Hopefully this was your week. Okay.

JERRY: Well, we got 8,000 tickets to check. (MARGE SIGHS)

杰瑞:我们开始吧。
JERRY: Let's get started.

575
00:30:25,089 --> 00:30:27,091
我们可能会看到日出。
We'll probably see sunrise.

(听不清)
(IMPERCEPTIBLE)

578
00:30:50,315 --> 00:30:55,453
(喘气)最后一个是3号冠军。
(GASPS) The last one is a three-number winner.

579
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,322
哦,很好。(在救援叹息)
Oh, good. (SIGHS IN RELIEF)

580
00:30:58,189 --> 00:30:59,324
好吧。
Okay.

581
00:31:01,092 --> 00:31:04,862
所以我们赌16000。嗯。
So we bet 16,000. Mmm-hmm.

582
00:31:06,097 --> 00:31:11,035
两名中奖者会给我们免费门票，
And the two number winners just gives us free tickets,

583
00:31:11,102 --> 00:31:13,571
所以如果我们把这些算作推动力……
so if we count those as a push...

584
00:31:13,638 --> 00:31:16,641
这意味着我们…
Which means we made...

585
00:31:17,775 --> 00:31:20,245
21043美元。
$21,043.

586
00:31:20,511 --> 00:31:22,013
哦……
Oh...

587
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,882
我觉得我们需要更多奥利奥。

732
00:39:24,929 --> 00:39:28,065
但是，我不能让顾客进来。
but, uh, I just can't have customers in here.

733
00:39:28,132 --> 00:39:29,667
这是一个责任。
It's a liability.

734
00:39:31,302 --> 00:39:33,237
嗯…
Well...

735
00:39:33,304 --> 00:39:35,372
如果我们不是顾客呢?
What if we weren't customers?

736
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,815
我不知道你在说什么。
I have no idea what you're talking about.

737
00:39:45,683 --> 00:39:48,919
如果我们是搭档呢?
What if we were partners?

738
00:39:48,986 --> 00:39:55,793
比尔，我来给你介绍一下GS投资策略公司。
Bill, I'd like to introduce you to GS Investment Strategies.

739
00:39:58,062 --> 00:39:59,730
我在。我能进来吗?
I'm in. Can I be in?

740
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:06,771
我是股东，如果你们愿意，我完全可以让你们加入。
So I'm a shareholder, and I could totally get you guys in if you want.

741
00:40:06,837 --> 00:40:10,207
所以，这是一个WinFall，所以当数字…
So, it's a WinFall, so when the numbers...

742
00:40:10,274 --> 00:40:14,245
好吧，你是投资者……好吧，假设你有几百美元。
Okay, you're an investor... Okay, let's say you've got several hundred dollars.

743
00:40:14,311 --> 00:40:19,617
还有这些彩票号码。如果他们不打，你就赢了。
Then there is these lottery numbers. If they don't hit, you win.

744
00:40:20,317 --> 00:40:23,087
你在吗?你有钱吗?
You in? You got any money?

745
00:40:24,021 --> 00:40:26,023
我想我们讲完了。
I believe we are done.

746
00:40:26,824 --> 00:40:28,692
嘿，我还有两个股东。
Hey, I got two more shareholders.

747
00:40:28,759 --> 00:40:31,896
他们中肯定有人去抢他父母的房子，但他肯定在里面。
One of them's got to rob his parents' house real quick, but he's definitely in.

748
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:35,499
又多了500张票。是的。
That's 500 more tickets. Yup.

749
00:40:35,566 --> 00:40:36,801
(笑着说)。
(LAUGHING) All right.

750
00:40:36,867 --> 00:40:38,569
你要来一口吗?
You want a bong hit real quick?

751
00:40:38,636 --> 00:40:41,505
我不知道那是什么。比尔:玛姬?
I don't know what that is. BILL: Marge?

752
00:40:41,572 --> 00:40:44,608
不,谢谢,比尔。好吧。噢!
No thanks, Bill. All right. Ow!

753
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:51,549
我们的下一个数字是46…

754
00:40:52,283 --> 00:40:54,018
数24…
Number 24...

755
00:40:54,084 --> 00:40:57,922
今天最后一个数字是23。
And our very last number for today is number 23.

756
00:40:57,988 --> 00:41:02,092
所以，再来一次，这些数字是05、21、39、46、24、23……
So, one more time, those numbers are 05, 21, 39, 46, 24, 23...

757
00:41:02,159 --> 00:41:04,595
马姬:好了，开始吧。
MARGE: Okay, here we go.

我想我们可以喝点美味的汽车旅馆咖啡
I guess we fire up some of that delicious motel coffee

762
00:41:19,376 --> 00:41:21,378

00:41:21,445 --> 00:41:23,047
或者可以等到明天早上。
Or it could wait till morning.

764

马丁:彩票中奖者点击率很高。
MARTIN: Lottery winners get a lot of clicks.

770
00:41:55,579 --> 00:41:57,615
我不做点击。我做新闻。
I don't do clicks. I do news.

771
00:41:57,681 --> 00:42:00,684
你没看到这些空隔间吗?
Do you not see all these empty cubicles?

(马姬笑了)杰瑞:嗯。
(MARGE LAUGHS) JERRY: Hmm.

776
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:23,107
这个床垫的好处是，我们都滚到中间去。
Oh, nice thing about this mattress is, we both roll to the center.

00:42:25,643 --> 00:42:28,212
我想就算我试了也逃不出去。
I don't think I can get out if I tried.

779
00:42:28,279 --> 00:42:29,947
我们还有时间。
Well, we have time.

00:42:53,871 --> 00:42:56,440
就是你的，再加六个。是的!
Just yours, plus six more. Yes!

This can't be real. I didn't believe it either,

但我在画画的时候进行了模拟，结果是对的。
but I've been running simulations during the drawings, and it's right.

Can you get money from your dad? I'm not asking him for shit.

为什么不呢?他的名字写在一栋建筑上。我想他能负担得起。
Why not? His name is on a building. I think he can afford it.

819
00:45:13,177 --> 00:45:14,678
因为这是我的。
Because this is mine.

Okay? A way to beat the game every time

因为没人知道我做了什么。
because nobody at the lottery figured out what I did.

但只有在你能下大赌注的情况下，它才管用。
But it only works if you can bet big.

你从一开始就做到了。
You did, from the start.

877
00:47:48,298 --> 00:47:49,399
道格:爸爸……
DOUG: Dad...

878
00:47:51,635 --> 00:47:53,036
你不用这么做的。
You didn't have to do that.

879
00:47:53,103 --> 00:47:55,372
没有你我可不想数硬币。
Oh, I didn't wanna count nickels without you.

880
00:48:00,544 --> 00:48:04,848
我跟你说，多蒂把书店办得很好。
I'm telling you, Dottie has done such a great job with this bookstore.

881
00:48:04,915 --> 00:48:07,351
是的。里昂正在装修酒店。
Yeah. You know, Leon is renovating the hotel.

882
00:48:07,417 --> 00:48:09,987
霍华德给了他一笔交易，但他的佣金是这么多
Howard got him a deal on it, but his commission is that

883
00:48:10,053 --> 00:48:12,889
他和雪莉随时都可以用热水浴缸。
he and Shirley get to use the hot tub whenever they want.

884
00:48:12,956 --> 00:48:14,791
里昂会后悔的。
Leon will regret that.

885
00:48:14,858 --> 00:48:16,193
你不是在开玩笑。
You are not kidding.

886
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:17,828
杰瑞:你好，大家好。女士:噢,嘿!
JERRY: Hello, hello, everybody. WOMAN: Oh, hey!

887
00:48:17,894 --> 00:48:19,096
(掌声)
(APPLAUSE)

888
00:48:21,431 --> 00:48:23,667
杰瑞:好吧。好吧,去吧……
JERRY: All right. Well, go ahead...

889
00:48:23,734 --> 00:48:25,836
来吧，坐下。
Go on, sit on down.

890
00:48:25,902 --> 00:48:29,673
嗯…嗯…(麦克风反馈)
Uh... Uh... (MICROPHONE FEEDBACK)

891
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:31,208
嗯…
Well...

892
00:48:31,275 --> 00:48:35,545
听着，首先，我可以说我们做得很好。
Look, first off, I can say that we're doing pretty darn well.

893
00:48:35,612 --> 00:48:37,180
雪莉:是的。(笑声)
SHIRLEY: Yes. (LAUGHTER)

894
00:48:37,247 --> 00:48:41,485
是的。但你可能已经通过阅读你的股东报告知道了……
Yeah. But you probably already know that by reading your shareholder report...

895
00:48:41,551 --> 00:48:43,120
我的打不开。
I can't get mine to open.

896
00:48:43,186 --> 00:48:44,588
哦，你有Word吗?
Oh, do you have Word?

897
00:48:44,655 --> 00:48:46,423
我想我有Windows。
I have Windows, I think.

898
00:48:46,490 --> 00:48:48,392
我给你印一份，雪莉。
I'll print you one, Shirley.

899
00:48:48,458 --> 00:48:49,459
噢,谢谢你。
Oh, thank you.

900
00:48:49,526 --> 00:48:50,994
Anyhoo……
Anyhoo...

901
00:48:52,029 --> 00:48:54,097
正如你所想象的，
As you might have imagined it,

902
00:48:54,164 --> 00:48:57,834
我们要把大部分资金用于赌博。
we're gonna use the majority of our capital for betting.

903
00:48:57,901 --> 00:48:59,036
男:是的。
MAN: Yeah.

904
00:48:59,102 --> 00:49:05,075
但你可以获得一些红利。
But there are dividends that you can access.

905
00:49:05,142 --> 00:49:10,247
正确的。所以，我知道很多人都想看到爵士音乐节回归。
Right. So, I know a lot of people would like to see the jazz festival come back.

906
00:49:10,314 --> 00:49:11,648
(同意)
(ALL AGREEING)

907
00:49:11,715 --> 00:49:16,086
而且，老弗兰克肯定会用一辆他不会掉下去的邮车。
And, Old Frank can sure use a mail truck he doesn't fall out of.

908
00:49:16,486 --> 00:49:17,721
(轻笑)
(LIGHT LAUGHTER)

909
00:49:17,788 --> 00:49:22,826
那么，现在来说说利润比率。我们……
Uh, so, now on to the profit ratios. We...

910
00:49:22,893 --> 00:49:25,495
是的,拉杰?这里没有吃的吗?
Yes, Raj? Is there not food at this thing?

911
00:49:25,562 --> 00:49:29,232
不。不。这是股东大会。这不是派对。
No. No. This is a shareholder meeting. It's not a party.

912
00:49:29,299 --> 00:49:32,703
那你为什么在6点吃，我们都吃的时候?
Then why did you have it at 6: 00, when we all eat?

913
00:49:32,769 --> 00:49:34,037
(模糊聊天)
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

914
00:49:34,104 --> 00:49:37,541
好吧，你们都可以去吃饭，但是…
Well, you're welcome to all go to the diner, but...

915
00:49:37,607 --> 00:49:40,711
不，那你就不会知道那些数字了。
No, then you're not gonna learn about the numbers.

916
00:49:42,245 --> 00:49:44,281
史堤夫:那么，下一步怎么办?
STEVE: So, what's the next play?

917
00:49:44,348 --> 00:49:46,183
312000张门票。
312,000 tickets.

918
00:49:46,249 --> 00:49:48,485
这是600000美元。杰瑞:是啊。
That's $600,000. JERRY: Yeah.

919
00:49:48,552 --> 00:49:52,089
我们在一场赌局下了50万?
We're betting half a million in one play?

920
00:49:52,155 --> 00:49:53,824
钱是最容易的部分。
Oh, the money is the easy part.

921
00:49:53,890 --> 00:49:55,225
是吗?是的。
Is it? Yeah.

922
00:49:55,292 --> 00:49:57,661
这需要四天的打赌时间
It'll take four days of betting,

923
00:49:57,728 --> 00:50:00,030
两台机器，一天12小时。
two machines, 12 hours a day.

924
00:50:00,097 --> 00:50:02,332
那你为什么不按正常金额下注呢?
Then why don't you just bet the normal amount?

925
00:50:02,399 --> 00:50:03,500
数学。
Math.

926
00:50:03,567 --> 00:50:04,634
这是牛顿定律。
It's Newton's law.

927
00:50:04,701 --> 00:50:08,004
如果你推什么东西，它就会推回来。
If you push against something, it's gonna push back.

928
00:50:08,071 --> 00:50:09,706
我们发现了一个缺陷。
And we discovered a flaw.

929
00:50:09,773 --> 00:50:14,411
但是通过使用它，我们引入了一个变量来改变它。
But by using it, we've introduced a variable that changes it.

930
00:50:14,478 --> 00:50:17,447
我们也不知道这场比赛会持续多久。
And we don't know how long this game is gonna last.

931
00:50:17,514 --> 00:50:20,884
那我们就得趁现在尽可能多赚钱。
Then we need to make as much money as we can, while we can.

932
00:50:20,951 --> 00:50:25,355
让节日开始吧，在它推迟之前完成重建。
Get the festival going, and finish rebuilding before it pushes back.

933
00:50:25,422 --> 00:50:26,356
嗯。
Mmm-hmm.

934
00:50:26,423 --> 00:50:27,991
我从彩票公司订购了第二台机器，
I ordered a second machine from the lottery,

935
00:50:28,058 --> 00:50:29,626
但他们说每个地方只能有一个，
but they said you're only allowed one per location,

936
00:50:29,693 --> 00:50:31,995
所以我想，“如果我有第二家店呢?”
so I was like, "Well, what if I have a second store?"

937
00:50:32,062 --> 00:50:35,098
他们会问:“地址是什么?”我当时想:“哦哦。这是我的错误。”
They're like, "What's the address?" I was like, "Uh-oh. There's my mistake."

938
00:50:35,165 --> 00:50:37,401
这就是我的朋友Darryl发挥作用的地方。
And that's where my buddy, Darryl, comes in.

939
00:50:37,467 --> 00:50:40,337
我们会多给他一份，但给你。
And, uh, we're gonna give him an extra share, but here you are.

940
00:50:40,404 --> 00:50:44,274
你可以一天24小时打印，外加无限的馅饼。
You can print out 24 hours a day, plus unlimited pie.

941
00:50:45,809 --> 00:50:46,810
(敲门)
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

942
00:50:48,111 --> 00:50:49,346
看看这个。
Look at this.

943
00:50:49,980 --> 00:50:51,114
这是什么?
What's this?

944
00:50:51,181 --> 00:50:52,816
从我在总检察长办公室的线人那里得到的。
From my source at the AG's office.

945
00:50:52,883 --> 00:50:56,153
现在，彩票必须披露那些索赔超过5万美元的玩家，
Now, the lottery has to disclose players who claim more than 50 grand,

946
00:50:56,219 --> 00:50:57,487
一年五次。
five times a year.

947
00:50:57,554 --> 00:50:59,823
有时候胜利者是前线，你知道的，
Sometimes the winners are fronts, you know,

948
00:50:59,890 --> 00:51:03,326
为欠孩子抚养费或有搜查令的人兑现罚单，
cashing tickets for people who owe child support, or have a warrant,

949
00:51:03,393 --> 00:51:06,930
但是看看这个家伙。每三周大赢一次。
but look at this guy. Wins big every three weeks.

950
00:51:06,997 --> 00:51:09,599
住在密歇根。一个退休的工厂工人。
Lives in Michigan. A retired factory worker.

951
00:51:09,666 --> 00:51:10,867
没有犯罪记录。
No criminal record.

952
00:51:10,934 --> 00:51:12,769
他赢了这么多?是的。
He's won this much? Yeah.

953
00:51:12,836 --> 00:51:17,040
谁每个月开10个小时的车去不同的州买彩票?
Who drives 10 hours every month to play the lottery in a different state?

954
00:51:17,107 --> 00:51:19,075
是啊，这说不通。正确的。
Yeah, that doesn't make any sense. Right.

955

那个女人刚抢了你的东西吗?
Did that woman just rob you?

958
00:51:50,006 --> 00:51:51,208
这是我的妻子。
That's my wife.

959
00:51:52,843 --> 00:51:53,844
哇。
Wow.

960
00:51:54,911 --> 00:51:56,880
嗯，她看起来很精神。
Well, she certainly seems spirited.

961
00:51:56,947 --> 00:51:58,582
是啊，她是个好斗的人。
Yeah, she's a spitfire.

962
00:51:58,648 --> 00:52:01,418
不，她只是因为我提出离婚而生气
No, she's just pissed off 'cause I filed for divorce,

963
00:52:01,485 --> 00:52:03,453
她从没想过我会买得起
and she didn't ever think I'd be able to afford it.

964
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:04,988
嗯。
Huh.

965
00:52:05,055 --> 00:52:07,657
看来钱花得值。是的。
Looks like money well spent. Yeah.

966
00:52:07,724 --> 00:52:11,728
自从史蒂利·丹停止巡演之后就没什么魔力了。

我需要找一个像你这样的人。
I need to find someone like you.

970
00:52:19,202 --> 00:52:22,205
只有年轻。是的，一开始很好。
Only younger. Yeah, that started off great.

971
00:52:22,272 --> 00:52:26,743
不，我是说，你懂的，就是一个还能生育的人。
No, I mean, you know, just someone that's still fertile.

972
00:52:26,810 --> 00:52:28,912
他们的子宫可以孕育婴儿。
And their womb can have babies.

973
00:52:28,979 --> 00:52:30,180
你不擅长这个。
You're not good at this.

974
00:52:30,247 --> 00:52:32,215
哦，我真的没有。你能帮我吗?
Oh, I'm really not. Can you help me?

975
00:52:33,049 --> 00:52:35,652
我妈妈曾经说过

“亲吻几只青蛙，然后当你找到你的王子，
"Kiss a few frogs, then when you find your prince,

“你会发现青蛙更好，因为它们能让你笑。”

but it's going to take time,

还有汗水和激情，好吗?
and sweat, and passion, okay?

The only thing that makes sense is another group eating into the pot,

996
00:53:25,368 --> 00:53:27,270
所以我查了每家店的销售额
so I checked sales at every store.

997
00:53:27,337 --> 00:53:30,473
这是公共信息?不，我黑进了州彩票。
That's public information? No, I hacked the state lottery.

00:53:30,907 --> 00:53:31,908
好了。
Nice.

00:53:32,909 --> 00:53:33,910
等待。这是我的笔记本。
Wait. That's my laptop.

1000
00:53:33,977 --> 00:53:35,879
是的。你应该在这之后销毁硬盘。
Yeah. You should destroy your hard drive after this.

Look at the winnings in Sunderland, from only two locations.

Two locations. They'd have to buy tickets for a week to get those kind of numbers.

1004
00:53:47,791 --> 00:53:49,359
他们现在就在那里。
They're there right now.

Hey. I finished early tonight.

What's the rush?

Oh... (LAUGHS)

You didn't think I'd forget our anniversary, did you?

Oh, you just got that out of the cooler. Well, yeah.

But I hid it behind the Yoo-hoo this morning so that nobody would get it.

Here you go.

敬46年。
Here's to 46 more years.

1020
00:54:52,922 --> 00:54:54,391
欢呼。
Cheers.

1021
00:54:56,493 --> 00:54:57,594
哦。
Ooh.

1022

(浪漫的歌曲扮演)
(ROMANTIC SONG PLAYS)

1023
00:55:03,433 --> 00:55:06,636
我想我还欠你一个舞会之夜。
I think I still owe you a prom night.

1024
00:55:22,986 --> 00:55:25,622
我16岁的时候还容易些。
This was easier when I was 16.

1025
00:55:27,190 --> 00:55:29,826
你现在更漂亮了。
You're even more beautiful now.

1026
00:55:29,893 --> 00:55:32,762
这是过时的香槟话。
That's the out-of-date champagne talking.

1027
00:55:32,829 --> 00:55:34,397
(笑着说)
(BOTH LAUGHING)

1028
00:55:34,464 --> 00:55:36,232
是啊，他真不该卖这个。
Yeah, he really shouldn't be selling that.

1029
00:55:36,299 --> 00:55:38,001
(笑着说)
(BOTH LAUGHING)

1030
00:55:39,069 --> 00:55:40,637
哦。嗯。
Oh. Mmm.

1031
00:55:41,538 --> 00:55:43,907
没有老师把我们分开。
No teacher to pull us apart.

1032
00:55:51,848 --> 00:55:53,116
(笑着说)
(BOTH LAUGHING)

1033
00:55:54,517 --> 00:55:56,319
你们是另一组吗?
You guys are the other group?

1034
00:55:56,386 --> 00:56:00,990
哦,男人。我们以为会是犯罪集团之类的。唷。
Oh, man. We thought it was gonna be, like, a crime syndicate or something. Phew.

1035
00:56:02,225 --> 00:56:03,293
(歌停止)
(SONG STOPS)

1036
00:56:03,359 --> 00:56:05,161
我不知道你在说什么。
I don't know what you're talking about.

1037
00:56:05,228 --> 00:56:08,832
抱歉，我们太没礼貌了。我是泰勒，这是埃里克。
Sorry, we are being super rude. I'm Tyler, this is Eric.

1038
00:56:08,898 --> 00:56:10,500
我们在哈佛开了一家博彩俱乐部。
We run a betting club at Harvard.

1039
00:56:10,567 --> 00:56:12,302
我们叫Random Industries，
We're called Random Industries,

1040
00:56:12,368 --> 00:56:14,904
这也是我滑板品牌的名字。
which is also the name of my skateboard brand.

1041
00:56:14,971 --> 00:56:17,607
我就知道会有别人的。
Well, I figured there'd be somebody else.

1042
00:56:17,674 --> 00:56:22,912
我也是，但我没想到会这样。看看你们。这就像。(笑)
Me, too, but I mean, I didn't expect this. Look at you guys. It's like Up. (LAUGHS)

1043
00:56:25,648 --> 00:56:27,684
你想喝杯香槟吗?
Would you like a glass of champagne?

1044
00:56:27,751 --> 00:56:30,720
不，我只喝野格和红牛。但是谢谢你。
No, I only drink Jager and Red Bull. But thank you.

1045
00:56:30,787 --> 00:56:35,158
好吧，至少你永远不用担心变成我们这个年纪了。
Oh, well, at least you'll never have to worry about being our age.

1046
00:56:37,327 --> 00:56:41,097
听着，我们同时玩只会伤害彼此，
Look, we're really only hurting each other by playing at the same time,

1047
00:56:41,164 --> 00:56:43,633
这里有一个更好的提议。
so here's a better offer.

1048
00:56:43,700 --> 00:56:47,370
你加入我的小组，把你的钱加到我们的锅里，
You join my group, add your capital to our pot,

1049
00:56:47,437 --> 00:56:49,072
我们会处理所有的赌注。
and we'll handle all the betting.

1050
00:56:49,139 --> 00:56:50,473
(笑)
(LAUGHS)

1051
00:56:51,407 --> 00:56:53,510
嗯，我不知道。
Well, I don't know.

1052
00:56:54,344 --> 00:56:56,412
我们喜欢做自己的事。
We kind of like to do our own thing.

1053
00:56:56,913 --> 00:56:58,014
什么?
What?

1054
00:56:58,081 --> 00:57:00,283
你什么都不用做就能得到报酬。
You'll get a cut without having to do anything.

1055
00:57:00,350 --> 00:57:05,421
我有一群赌徒。你甚至不用离开你的摇椅。
I have an army of bettors. You won't even have to leave your rocking chairs.

1056
00:57:06,089 --> 00:57:07,390
我们很好。
We're good.

1057
00:57:07,457 --> 00:57:10,794
这是为了赚钱。你喜欢钱，对吧?
This is about making money. You like money, right?

1058
00:57:10,860 --> 00:57:14,430
不像我喜欢其他东西那么喜欢。
Well, not as much as I like other things.

1059
00:57:14,497 --> 00:57:16,166
艾瑞克:哦，天哪。
ERIC: Oh, my God.

1060
00:57:16,232 --> 00:57:22,605
如果你们不介意的话，今天是我们的结婚纪念日。
Uh, now, look, if you two don't mind, this is our anniversary.

1061
00:57:22,672 --> 00:57:27,443
你破坏了我们酒店的气氛。
And you are killing the ambience of our liquor store.

1062
00:57:27,510 --> 00:57:30,313
欢迎你在路上喝一杯红牛。
You're welcome to take a Red Bull for the road.

1063
00:57:30,380 --> 00:57:32,882
或者一盒果汁。
Or maybe a juice box.

1064
00:57:38,888 --> 00:57:40,190
你数学很好。
You're good at math.

1065
00:57:40,924 --> 00:57:42,759
耶!
Yay!

1066
00:57:42,826 --> 00:57:44,894
我相信这对农场很有帮助，但在哈佛，
I'm sure that helps out on the farm, but at Harvard,

1067
00:57:44,961 --> 00:57:47,864
我们学到了二项分布。
we learn a little something called binomial distribution.

1068
00:57:48,832 --> 00:57:50,333
查一下。
Look it up.

1069
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:53,002
然后你就会明白为什么你自己填单子的几率会更高。
Then you'll see why your odds are better when you fill out your own slips.

1070
00:57:53,069 --> 00:57:54,704
不客气
You're welcome.

1071
00:57:54,771 --> 00:58:00,109
二项分布只考虑两个因素。
Binomial distribution only considers two factors.

1072
00:58:00,176 --> 00:58:03,179
没有第三个，那是人为的错误，也没有第四个，
Not a third, which is human error, or a fourth,

1073
00:58:03,246 --> 00:58:07,717
也就是你填票的时间。
which is the time it takes for you to fill in the tickets.

1074
00:58:07,784 --> 00:58:13,790
你每赢10万就能赚32块。
You gain a whooping 32 bucks for every $100,000 you win.

1075
00:58:15,458 --> 00:58:16,693
不客气
You're welcome.

1076
00:58:18,461 --> 00:58:20,096
严重吗?闭嘴!
Seriously? Shut up!

1077
00:58:23,099 --> 00:58:24,234

(DOOR SLAMS)

1078

泰勒:什么?(嘲笑)
TYLER: What? (SCOFFS)

1079
00:58:27,103 --> 00:58:30,406
我想没有傻孩子就不叫毕业舞会了。
I guess it wouldn't be a prom without dumb teenagers.

1080

(笑)
(BOTH LAUGH)

1081
00:58:32,976 --> 00:58:35,979
这让我想起了我们上次讲到的地方。
That reminds me of where we left off.

律师:是的。你会得到一切。
LAWYER: Yes. You get everything.

1085
00:59:08,745 --> 00:59:13,783
比尔只想保住他在GS战略公司的份额。
Bill just wants to keep his share of GS Strategies.

1086
00:59:13,850 --> 00:59:15,952
无论什么。我得到了房子。
Whatever. I got the house.

1087
00:59:18,588 --> 00:59:21,057
祝你好运，坎迪斯。
Well, good luck to you, Candace.

1088
00:59:21,124 --> 00:59:24,494
你知道吗，我们在那里度过了几年美好的时光然后一切都变糟了。
You know, we had a few good years there before it all turned to shit.

1089
00:59:24,560 --> 00:59:26,596
我希望你能找到你的青蛙。
And I hope you find your frog.

1090
00:59:27,363 --> 00:59:28,564
啊哈。
Uh-huh.

1091
00:59:30,266 --> 00:59:33,736
嘿，什么是GS什么的?
Hey, what is GS whatever?

哦,是的。我是这个小公司的一份子。
Oh, yeah. That's a little company I'm a part of.

1093
00:59:36,406 --> 00:59:37,874

我很想让冰淇淋店重新开张。
RAJ: I'd love to re-open the ice cream shop.

1098
01:00:01,264 --> 01:00:04,834
现在你可以以每年1.19美元的价格出租了。
Well, now you can lease it for $1.19 a year.

1099
01:00:04,901 --> 01:00:07,637
市区基金会支付剩下的。
And the Downtown fund will cover the rest.

1100

1.19美元吗?嗯。
$1.19? Mmm-hmm.

我们只需要坚持下去。
We just have to stay in the game.

我们将。你说得倒轻巧。
And we will. Well, that's easy for you to say.

你又不是连续5天站在机器前。
You're not standing at a machine for five days straight.

不,不。没关系。
No, no. That's okay.

Well, it doesn't feel like I did. MARGE: Oh, oh...

你们这几周是怎么做到的?
How did you guys do this for weeks?

不，这不是冒险。
Oh, no, this is not an adventure.

Oh, no, no, I want to. I do.

01:01:31,521 --> 01:01:35,358
我是说，我从来没有机会和你们在一起，而且，你知道…
I mean, I never get to spend time with you guys, and, you know...

哦。这是一个赢家。
Oops. This one's a winner.

哦，你错过了。好吧。(叹息)我完成了。我完成了。
Oh, you missed it. Okay. (SIGHS) I'm done. I'm done.

1136
01:01:51,340 --> 01:01:53,676
你什么时候能把所有的赢家都交上来?
Hey, when's the part where you get to turn in all the winners?

因为我会这么做的。嗯，那很有趣。
Because I will do that. Well, that is fun.

但这项运动为该州带来了巨大的成功。
But the game has been a huge success for the state.

我们为学校筹集了很多钱，但没人写这方面的文章。
We raise a lot of money for schools, but nobody does an article about that.

01:03:26,869 --> 01:03:28,538
不会太久的。
This won't take long.

1162
01:03:28,604 --> 01:03:30,573
我们不加入你的小组。
We're not joining your group.

我不希望你这样。
I don't want you to.

我不需要你的资金了。
I don't really need your capital anymore.

1165

我只需要你退出游戏。
I just need you out of the game.

1166
01:03:35,645 --> 01:03:38,314
所以,你是。什么?
So, you're out. What?

1167
01:03:38,381 --> 01:03:42,785
你看，你不像计算数字那样擅长计算人。
See, you're not really as good at calculating people as you are numbers.

1168
01:03:42,852 --> 01:03:47,390
所以你还没算过像我这样的人为了获胜会怎么做。
So you haven't really run the math on what somebody like me would do to win.

1169
01:03:54,397 --> 01:03:56,432
你会怎么做?
And what would you do?

1170
01:03:57,800 --> 01:04:00,736
让一群你见过的最聪明的孩子来对付你

We hacked into the state lottery to find where you were betting.

1173
01:04:09,478 --> 01:04:13,449
你觉得我们不能黑进你的账户吗?
You don't think that we can hack into your accounts?

1174
01:04:14,417 --> 01:04:17,520
你的信用?你的身份吗?
Your credit? Your identity?

1175
01:04:18,788 --> 01:04:20,823
这并不难。我的意思是……
It won't be hard. I mean...

你为什么要这么做?

这只是数学。任何个人。
It's just math. Nothing personal.

听着，你干得不错。
Look, you had a good run.

1180
01:04:34,670 --> 01:04:37,473
你为梅贝瑞赚了些钱。
You made some cash for Mayberry.

这是我从没见过你做的事

1246
01:10:00,529 --> 01:10:04,133
就是在找到解决方法之前就放弃。

You all right? JERRY: Yeah, I got it.

1299
01:12:56,705 --> 01:12:58,774
哦。好吧。
Oh. Okay.

1302
01:13:03,212 --> 01:13:04,680

1305
01:13:09,418 --> 01:13:10,519
我们错过了!
We missed it!

1306
01:13:10,586 --> 01:13:13,255
怎么，有人把六个号码都打中了吗?
What, someone actually hit all six numbers?

1307
01:13:13,322 --> 01:13:14,556
不。不。它滚下来。
No. No. It rolled down.

1308
01:13:14,623 --> 01:13:17,092
不,那是不可能的。这只是第二周。
No, that's impossible. It's only the second week.

1309
01:13:17,159 --> 01:13:19,027
它从不在三点前滚下来。
It never rolls down before three.

1310
01:13:19,094 --> 01:13:21,396
它昨晚滚下来了，我们错过了。
It rolled down last night, and we missed it.

1311
01:13:24,833 --> 01:13:27,402
哈佛大学的小组是自己触发的。
The Harvard group triggered it on their own.

1312
01:13:27,469 --> 01:13:29,204
马姬:他们怎么知道该赌多少钱?
MARGE: How would they know how much to bet?

1313
01:13:29,271 --> 01:13:31,406

The lottery doesn't post the amount...

1314

Where are you going, Jerry?

1317

(CAR DOOR CLOSES) Jerry!

1318
01:14:15,217 --> 01:14:18,487
泰勒:这都上新闻了。彩票甚至没有预见到它的到来。
TYLER: It's on the freakin' news. The lottery didn't even see it coming.

这太史诗了。(ERIC笑)
This is so epic. (ERIC LAUGHS)

1320
01:14:22,825 --> 01:14:23,959
嘿,杰瑞。
Hey, Jerry.

1321
01:14:24,026 --> 01:14:25,994
你是开着拖拉机来的吗
What, did you come ridin' in on your tractor

1322
01:14:26,061 --> 01:14:27,496
来给我一声欢呼?
to come give me a whoopin'?

1323
01:14:27,563 --> 01:14:29,932
相信我，我也想。
Believe me, I wanted to.

1324
01:14:31,500 --> 01:14:33,068
我内心的一部分仍然如此。
Part of me still does.

1325
01:14:35,370 --> 01:14:39,341
但在长途开车来这里的路上，
But then on the long drive here,

1326
01:14:39,408 --> 01:14:42,978
好吧，大部分都消失了。
well, most of that just, poof, went away.

1327
01:14:43,045 --> 01:14:46,715
我意识到我并不是真的生你的气。
And I realized that I wasn't really angry at you.

1328
01:14:47,282 --> 01:14:49,218
我很失望。
I'm disappointed.

1329
01:14:49,284 --> 01:14:50,919
你对我很失望?
Aw, you're disappointed in me?

1330
01:14:50,986 --> 01:14:53,222
不,不是你。你是无关紧要的。
No, not you. You're insignificant.

1331
01:14:53,288 --> 01:14:59,661
不，我很失望让你这样一个自私的孩子影响了我。嗯。
No, I was disappointed that I let a selfish kid like you get to me. Huh.

1332
01:14:59,728 --> 01:15:03,031
我数学一直很好，
I was always good with math,

01:15:03,098 --> 01:15:08,537
但我花了很长时间才了解别人。
but it took a long time for me to figure people out.

1334
01:15:08,604 --> 01:15:12,274
告诉我们，杰瑞，你发现了什么?
So, tell us, Jerry, what did you figure out?

1335
01:15:12,341 --> 01:15:15,577
解决方案不是数字。
That the solution isn't numbers.

1336
01:15:15,644 --> 01:15:21,483
你说我买彩票是因为我一无所有。
You told me that I was playing the lottery because I had nothing else.

1337
01:15:21,550 --> 01:15:29,024
但你不愿分享这壶是因为你没有别的了。
But the reason you won't share the pot is because you have nothing else.

1338
01:15:29,091 --> 01:15:33,595
你以为做屋里最聪明的人就够了吗。
You think being the smartest guy in the room is all that matters.

1339
01:15:33,662 --> 01:15:39,201
但事实证明，这个房间才是最重要的。
But it turns out it's this room that matters.

1340
01:15:39,268 --> 01:15:44,072
这些聪明的年轻人帮你致富。
All these bright, young people helping you get rich.

1341
01:15:46,475 --> 01:15:49,578
你是如何帮助他们的?
How are you helping them?

1342
01:15:49,645 --> 01:15:53,148
我猜你还没算出来吧?
Guess you haven't run the math out on that, huh?

什么?继续数吧。
What? Just get back to counting.

1348
01:16:19,608 --> 01:16:24,546
如果哈佛队能触发下滚，他们就能掌控比赛。
If the Harvard team can trigger a roll down, they run the game.

1349
01:16:24,613 --> 01:16:26,181
所以我们触发了自己的向下滚动。
So we trigger our own roll down.

1350
01:16:26,248 --> 01:16:27,883
是的，我们有足够的现金。
Yeah, we have enough cash.

1351
01:16:27,950 --> 01:16:29,084
不。为什么?
No. Why?

1352
01:16:29,151 --> 01:16:31,920
因为这对普通球员不公平。
Because it's not fair to the regular players.

1353
01:16:31,987 --> 01:16:33,689
他是对的。我们不是这样的人。
He's right. It's not who we are.

1354
01:16:33,755 --> 01:16:34,923
但我们已经很接近了。
But we're so close.

I mean, downtown is back, the jazz fest is coming.

1356
01:16:37,592 --> 01:16:40,195
如果我们一直赢，我们就可以雇人去那里打球。
If we keep winning, we could actually hire somebody to play there.

1357
01:16:40,262 --> 01:16:41,330

You should get Steely Dan.

1358

这主意太棒了。我们应该找钢铁丹。
That is an amazing idea. We should get Steely Dan.

1359
01:16:44,232 --> 01:16:46,168
我们不玩就赢不了。
We can't win if we can't play.

1360
01:16:46,234 --> 01:16:47,536
这太糟糕了。
Well, this just sucks.

1361
01:16:47,602 --> 01:16:51,106
彩票不能阻止我们，一群大学生却能?
The lottery isn't stopping us, but a bunch of college kids are?

1362
01:16:51,173 --> 01:16:54,609
嗯，说得好。是什么?我不是在说什么。
Huh, that's a good point. What is? I wasn't making a point.

1363
01:16:54,676 --> 01:16:57,813
为什么彩票没有阻止他们?
Why isn't the lottery stopping them?

1364
01:16:57,879 --> 01:17:00,349
那是因为他们不在乎。
It's because they don't care.

1365
01:17:01,383 --> 01:17:02,617
哦。
Oh.

1366
01:17:03,218 --> 01:17:04,686
这可能是我们的答案。
That could be our answer.

01:17:10,158 --> 01:17:14,930
很高兴见到我们的忠实玩家，赛尔比先生和夫人。

1370
01:17:20,502 --> 01:17:21,670
杰瑞:事情是这样的。
JERRY: So here's the thing.

1371
01:17:21,737 --> 01:17:25,640
几年前，州彩票一直在亏损，
The state lottery was losing money a few years ago,

1372
01:17:25,707 --> 01:17:27,909
几乎没有人中头奖，
and hardly anybody was winning the jackpot,

1373
01:17:27,976 --> 01:17:31,747
超级百万吃掉了你的午餐。
so Mega Millions ate your lunch.

1374
01:17:31,813 --> 01:17:35,083
然后随着WinFall的到来，一切都改变了。
Then along comes WinFall, and all that changes.

1375
01:17:35,150 --> 01:17:37,219
你们赚了几百万，
You folks made millions,

1376
01:17:37,285 --> 01:17:41,423
在你意识到数学有个缺陷之前。
before you realized there was a flaw in the math.

1377
01:17:42,357 --> 01:17:44,893
一开始你可能会惊慌失措
You probably panicked at first,

1378
01:17:44,960 --> 01:17:47,863
因为你知道一旦所有人都看到了，
because you knew that once everybody saw it,

1379
01:17:47,929 --> 01:17:50,399
游戏会崩溃。
that the game would collapse.

1380
01:17:50,465 --> 01:17:52,467
只是他们没有看到。
Except they didn't see it.

1381
01:17:52,534 --> 01:17:55,837
只有我和几个哈佛的孩子。
Only me and a few kids from Harvard.

1382
01:17:55,904 --> 01:17:59,241
这意味着我们在游戏中投入了数百万美元，
Which meant that we were pushing millions into the game,

1383
01:17:59,307 --> 01:18:02,377
小子，你的利润也高得惊人。
and, boy, sent your profits through the roof.

1384
01:18:03,879 --> 01:18:09,251
所以，突然之间，你的错误变成了你的意外之财。
So, all of a sudden, your mistake became your windfall.

1385
01:18:09,317 --> 01:18:10,385
我给了他那句台词。
I gave him that line.

1387
01:18:14,456 --> 01:18:16,258
你到底想要什么?
So, what exactly do you want?

1388
01:18:16,324 --> 01:18:18,260
透明度。
Transparency.

1389
01:18:18,326 --> 01:18:23,732
我们希望网站显示的大小，头奖。
We'd like the website to show the size of the jackpot.

1390
01:18:23,799 --> 01:18:27,369
这可以防止任何团体强行向下滚动。
That prevents any group from forcing a roll down.

1391
01:18:28,503 --> 01:18:31,440
对所有参赛选手都公平。
Makes it fair for anybody who plays.

1392

And we would like two machines at the Liquor Hut in Sunderland.

1393
01:18:36,645 --> 01:18:38,146
这样我们才能在一起。
So we can be together.

这是我们的黄金岁月。
These are our golden years.

Yeah, we'll be making another play soon.

That's great to hear. Yeah. Talk soon.

The lottery changed the website. You can track the jackpot online.

好的，泰勒·兰福德，我看到你了。
Okay, Tyler Langford, I see you.

1441
01:21:27,616 --> 01:21:30,819
这是我花过的最好的一欧元。
Best euro I've ever spent.

1442
01:21:30,885 --> 01:21:32,454
谢谢,拉吉。瑞吉:谢谢你。
Thanks, Raj. RAJ: Thank you.

1443
01:21:32,520 --> 01:21:33,521
好吧,女孩。
Okay, girl.

1444
01:21:38,426 --> 01:21:39,928
该死的!杰瑞:哇!
Darn! JERRY: Whoa!

1445
01:21:39,995 --> 01:21:41,596
再试一次，亲爱的。
Try one more time, sweetheart.

1446
01:21:41,663 --> 01:21:43,198
像袋鼠一样。(JERRY笑)
Like a kangaroo. (JERRY LAUGHS)

1447
01:21:43,265 --> 01:21:45,533
嘿，你能给我一个一千万吗?是的。
Hey, would you hand me a 10 mil? Yeah.

1448
01:21:47,435 --> 01:21:48,970
10毫升。
Ten mil.

1449
01:21:49,671 --> 01:21:51,039
给你。谢谢你！
Here you go. Thank you.

1450
01:21:51,106 --> 01:21:52,907
你都不给自己买辆新卡车吗?
You won't even buy yourself a new truck?

1451
01:21:52,974 --> 01:21:54,676
不。这个作品。
Nah. This one works.

1452
01:21:54,743 --> 01:21:55,944
不是吗?
Does it?

1453
01:21:56,011 --> 01:21:59,080
不是一直都是这样。但我想这就是我喜欢它的原因。
Not all the time. But I think that's why I like it.

1454
01:21:59,147 --> 01:22:00,148
嗯。
Hmm.

1455
01:22:00,915 --> 01:22:02,217
你知道吗?
You know what?

1456
01:22:03,351 --> 01:22:04,686
我确实买了这个。
I did buy this.

1457
01:22:05,687 --> 01:22:07,289
(笑)
(CHUCKLES)

1458
01:22:10,625 --> 01:22:16,031
我和你一起数镍币是因为我能理解。
I counted nickels with you because it was something I understood.

1459
01:22:18,099 --> 01:22:21,903
我不知道还有什么更好的方式和你共度时光。
I didn't know a better way to spend time with you.

1460
01:22:21,970 --> 01:22:23,972
我只知道我想这么做。
I just knew that I wanted to.

1461
01:22:29,077 --> 01:22:30,612
你知道是怎么回事吗?
You know how it works?

1462
01:22:30,679 --> 01:22:35,183
我假设你创造了自旋，这就有了第三个轴，
Well, I assume you create spin, which gives it a third axis,

1463
01:22:35,250 --> 01:22:38,586
这样风就能抵消重力。
so that the wind can offset the gravity.

1464
01:22:40,188 --> 01:22:42,290
是的,就是这样。就像这样。
Yeah, that's it. Just like that.

1465
01:22:44,826 --> 01:22:46,528
想要验证这个理论吗?
Wanna test that theory?

1466
01:22:46,594 --> 01:22:47,629
好吧。
All right.

1467
01:22:47,696 --> 01:22:49,230
手指放在鞋带上。是的。
Fingers on the laces. Yeah.

1468
01:22:52,167 --> 01:22:53,601
哦,好吧。不坏。
Oh, well. Not bad.

1469
01:22:53,668 --> 01:22:56,438
我会解决的。我知道你会的。
I'll work it out. I know you will.

1470
01:22:57,839 --> 01:23:00,141
哦,就是这样。玛雅:Selbee先生吗?
Oh, that's it. MAYA: Mr. Selbee?

1471
01:23:01,009 --> 01:23:03,311
玛雅可要注意了。波士顿环球报。
Maya Jordon. Boston Globe.

1472
01:23:04,713 --> 01:23:08,516
我想问你一些关于GS投资策略的问题。
I'd like to ask you some questions about GS Investment Strategies.

1473
01:23:10,652 --> 01:23:17,125
你和你妻子在酒店房间里数了11天的票?
So, you and your wife count tickets in a hotel room for 11 days?

1474
01:23:17,192 --> 01:23:18,259
是的。
Yup.

1475
01:23:18,626 --> 01:23:20,028
(笑)
(CHUCKLES)

1476
01:23:20,095 --> 01:23:22,731
工作量太大了。
That's so much work.

1477
01:23:24,599 --> 01:23:26,000
嗯。
Mmm.

1478
01:23:26,067 --> 01:23:28,503
这看起来不像是工作。
It doesn't seem like work.

1479
01:23:28,570 --> 01:23:30,605
我一生都在工作。
I've worked all my life.

1480
01:23:31,439 --> 01:23:33,174
这是不同的。
This is different.

1481
01:23:34,609 --> 01:23:36,611
这是非常不同的。
This is very different.

1482
01:23:50,859 --> 01:23:52,694
你寄过去了吗?
You send it in yet?

1483
01:23:52,761 --> 01:23:54,729
他们帮助了整个小镇。
They helped their entire town.

1484
01:23:55,764 --> 01:23:57,265
问题不在于故事本身。
The flaw isn't the story.

1485
01:23:57,332 --> 01:23:59,501
这可不是什么吹捧的文章。
Well, this can't be a puff piece.

1486
01:24:00,034 --> 01:24:01,369
我需要一个头条新闻。
I need a headline.

1487
01:24:11,980 --> 01:24:14,449
(发动机停止)啊。
(ENGINE STOPS) Ah.

1488
01:24:14,516 --> 01:24:19,821
(叹气)好吧，我们做得很好，我们不再需要这个游戏了。
(SIGHS) well, we do well on this one, we won't need the game anymore.

1489
01:24:19,888 --> 01:24:21,089
我在想，
You know, I was thinking,

1490
01:24:21,156 --> 01:24:23,491
如果我们要为小镇筹集资金，
if we're going to have a fund for the town,

1491
01:24:23,558 --> 01:24:25,927
管理它，将是一项全职工作。
managing it, it's gonna be a full-time job.

1492
01:24:25,994 --> 01:24:27,862
嗯…
Well...

1493
01:24:27,929 --> 01:24:32,700
你觉得我们能在市中心弄间办公室吗，像史蒂夫的那样?
Hey, you think we can get one of those offices downtown, like Steve's?

1494
01:24:32,767 --> 01:24:34,335
(士力架)什么?
(SNICKERS) What?

1495
01:24:34,402 --> 01:24:36,337
我已经在他旁边买了一个了。
I already got us one right next to his.

1496
01:24:36,404 --> 01:24:37,972
你做了吗?(笑)是的!
You did? (LAUGHS) Yes!

1497
01:24:38,039 --> 01:24:41,309
事实上，他的克尔维特就停在我们的一个停车位上。
In fact, his Corvette is actually in one of our parking spots.

1498
01:24:41,376 --> 01:24:43,411
杰瑞:嗯，我们得考虑一下。
JERRY: Well, we'll have to take care of that.

1499
01:24:43,478 --> 01:24:46,014
玛姬:什么?他们要把WinFall的机器搬出去。
MARGE: What? They're moving out the WinFall machine.

1500
01:24:46,080 --> 01:24:47,549
嘿,嘿!嘿。嘿!
Hey, hey! Hey. Hey!

1501
01:24:50,051 --> 01:24:53,955
嘿。比尔!比尔,发生了什么事?
Hey. Bill! Bill, what happened?

1502
01:24:54,022 --> 01:24:55,990
彩票吊销了我们的执照。
The lottery suspended our license.

1503
01:24:56,057 --> 01:24:58,126
为什么?你没看到那篇文章吗?
Why? You didn't see the article?

1504
01:25:02,397 --> 01:25:03,631
玛吉:哦。
MARGE: Oh.

1505
01:25:12,040 --> 01:25:14,309
嘿,哥们。学校怎么样?哦,爸爸。
Hey, buddy. How's school? Uh, Dad.

1506
01:25:14,375 --> 01:25:16,344
你在这里做什么?你是著名的。
What are you doing here? You're famous.

1507
01:25:18,713 --> 01:25:20,381
伟大的举动,天才。
Great move, genius.

1508
01:25:20,448 --> 01:25:22,817
我们走吧。收拾好你的东西。你回家。
Let's go. Pack up your stuff. You're coming home.

1509
01:25:23,985 --> 01:25:25,320
现在。
Now.

1510
01:25:28,056 --> 01:25:30,992
大量投注的团体发现了游戏中的一个缺陷
The high-volume betting groups discovered a flaw in the game

1511
01:25:31,059 --> 01:25:34,429
然后利用它，赚了几百万美元。
and took advantage of it, to the tune of millions of dollars.

1512
01:25:34,496 --> 01:25:37,165
彩票官员对这一发现表示惊讶
Lottery officials expressed their surprise at the discovery

1513
01:25:37,232 --> 01:25:40,869
并宣布他们将在今晚的平局后逐步淘汰比赛。
and announced they will phase out the game after tonight's drawing.

1514
01:25:40,935 --> 01:25:42,670
继续我们的下一个…(电视停止)
Moving on to our next... (TV STOPS)

1515
01:25:42,737 --> 01:25:46,774
最后一卷是今天。你本可以赢得最后的胜利。
The last roll down was today. You could've gotten your final win.

1516
01:25:49,344 --> 01:25:53,214
是的。但即使我们找到了打赌的地方，
Yes. But even if we found a place to bet,

1517
01:25:53,281 --> 01:25:55,416
那感觉就不一样了。
it wouldn't have felt the same.

1518
01:25:57,752 --> 01:25:59,120
玛姬(普通员工)
(MARGE GRUNTS)

1519
01:25:59,187 --> 01:26:01,789
对他来说，这不仅仅是一场游戏。
It was more than just a game to him.

1520
01:26:06,561 --> 01:26:09,831
他终于可以用他的天赋与人交流了。
He finally got to use his gift to connect to people.

1521
01:26:11,332 --> 01:26:12,800
(播放的音乐)

1522
01:26:15,203 --> 01:26:16,671

1525

什么?
What?

1526
01:26:23,745 --> 01:26:25,213
股东们今晚要开会
The shareholders are having a meeting tonight

1527
01:26:25,280 --> 01:26:27,815
不知道你能不能过来一趟。
and were wondering if you could stop by.

1528
01:26:27,882 --> 01:26:29,083
他们是沮丧吗?
Are they upset?

1529
01:26:29,150 --> 01:26:31,252
如果我告诉你，你就不会来了。
If I told you that, you wouldn't come.

1530
01:26:34,389 --> 01:26:36,891
杰瑞:我试着在时事通讯上回答他们所有的问题。
JERRY: I tried to answer all their questions in the newsletter.

1531
01:26:36,958 --> 01:26:39,027
我觉得他们不知道怎么打开通讯。
I don't think they know how to open the newsletter.

1532
01:26:39,093 --> 01:26:41,329
他们什么都不用担心。
Well, they don't have to worry about anything.

1533
01:26:41,396 --> 01:26:43,231
我们没有违反任何法律。
We didn't break any laws.

1534
01:26:46,501 --> 01:26:50,371
神圣的…这是爵士乐节?什么?
Holy... It's jazz fest? What?

1535
01:26:50,438 --> 01:26:52,874
男:杰瑞!玛姬!杰瑞:嗯。
MAN: Jerry! Marge! JERRY: Huh.

1536
01:26:53,875 --> 01:26:55,643
男:是啊!
MAN: Yeah!

1537
01:26:57,745 --> 01:26:59,147
(欢呼,掌声)
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

1538
01:26:59,213 --> 01:27:00,882

BILL: Come on!

1539
01:27:00,949 --> 01:27:02,450
让我们这样做!
Let's do this!

1540
01:27:07,021 --> 01:27:10,024
是啊!好了,对吧?
Yeah! Okay, right?

1541
01:27:10,091 --> 01:27:12,427
周和玛姬!
Jer and Marge!

1542
01:27:12,493 --> 01:27:16,331
你是怎么……我们错过了最后的演出。
How did you... We missed the final play.

1543
01:27:16,397 --> 01:27:17,765
哦，不，我们没有。
Oh, no, we did not.

1544
01:27:17,832 --> 01:27:20,368
是啊，每个人都抢了一间店，爸爸。整个州。
Yeah, everybody took a store, Dad. All across the state.

1545
01:27:20,435 --> 01:27:22,203
我们有一辆公共汽车和一切。
We had a bus and everything.

1546
01:27:22,270 --> 01:27:23,972
什么?哦。
What? Oh.

1547
01:27:24,038 --> 01:27:25,406
你不用这么做的。
You didn't have to do that.

1548
01:27:25,473 --> 01:27:27,542
你这么做是为了我们。我们为什么不帮你呢?
You did it for us. Why wouldn't we do it for you?

1549
01:27:27,609 --> 01:27:30,812
别担心，我们把计数的部分留给你们了。
And don't worry, we left you two the counting part.

1550

1551
01:27:35,717 --> 01:27:37,518
嘿,拉吉!
Hey, Raj!

1552
01:27:37,585 --> 01:27:39,754
我想帮忙，但我不会数数。
I would help, but, uh, I can't count.

1553
01:27:39,821 --> 01:27:43,591
霍华德:当然可以。我可以计算。我只是不喜欢数。
HOWARD: Yes, you can. I can count. I just don't like to count.

1554
01:27:43,658 --> 01:27:46,728
这个小镇不只是报纸上的文章，杰瑞。是我们所有人。
This town isn't just a newspaper article, Jerry. It's all of us.

1555
01:27:46,794 --> 01:27:49,097
是你让这个小镇起死回生的
And you brought this town back from the dead

1556
01:27:49,163 --> 01:27:52,700
别人都做不到，因为你不认为我们只是数字。
when nobody else could, because you don't think we're just numbers.

1557
01:27:54,969 --> 01:27:56,404
