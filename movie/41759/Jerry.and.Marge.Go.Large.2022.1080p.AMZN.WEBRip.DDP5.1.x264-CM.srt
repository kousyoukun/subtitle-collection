1
00:00:33.968 --> 00:00:37.375
这是我的朋友杰瑞和玛姬·塞尔比。
 These are my friends, Jerry and Marge Selbee.

2
00:00:42.246 --> 00:00:44.448
他们住在密歇根州的埃瓦特。
They live in Evart, Michigan.

3
00:00:46.916 --> 00:00:50.751
这是一个并不完全处于鼎盛时期的小镇。
It's a small town that's not exactly in its prime.

4
00:00:50.787 --> 00:00:54.458
不过，老实说，杰瑞和玛吉也不是。
Though, to be honest, neither are Jerry and Marge.

5
00:00:55.825 --> 00:00:58.899
今天，他们在去买彩票的路上。
Today, they're on their way to buy lottery tickets.

6
00:00:58.934 --> 00:01:01.830
很多很多彩票。
Lots and lots of lottery tickets.

7
00:01:03.105 --> 00:01:04.831
但他们不希望运气好。
 But they're not hoping to get lucky.

8
00:01:05.774 --> 00:01:08.637
你看，他们不需要运气。
You see, they don't need luck.

9
00:01:17.118 --> 00:01:19.450
但这个故事并不是从那里开始的。
But this story doesn't start there.

10
00:01:20.315 --> 00:01:22.050
从Jerry开始，
It starts with Jerry,

11
00:01:22.085 --> 00:01:27.159
黎明前起床就像他42年来每天一样，
getting up before dawn just like he has every day for 42 years,

12
00:01:27.195 --> 00:01:29.557
去玉米片厂工作，
going to work at the Corn Flakes factory,

13
00:01:29.592 --> 00:01:33.164
因为他担心的将是最后一次。
for what he fears will be the last time.

14
00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.736
这是一道数学题，真的。
 It's a math problem, really.

15
00:01:35.771 --> 00:01:38.499
如果你数一数这些字母，
If you count the letters, uh,

16
00:01:38.535 --> 00:01:40.366
除了他们跳过的字母“I”
except the letter "I," which they skip

17
00:01:40.402 --> 00:01:42.239
因为它看起来像“1”，
because it looks like a "1",

18
00:01:42.275 --> 00:01:46.241
然后你意识到“J”是二月。
then you realize that "J" is February.

19
00:01:46.276 --> 00:01:48.946
然后，最后一个字母。。。
And then, the last letter...

20
00:01:48.981 --> 00:01:50.410
哦，孩子。
Oh, boy.

21
00:01:50.446 --> 00:01:52.085
指定工厂代码，
That designates the plant code,

22
00:01:52.121 --> 00:01:54.881
这不容易弄清楚，但是，呃。。。
which was not easy to figure out, but, uh...

23
00:01:56.821 --> 00:01:57.884
我做到了。
I did.

24
00:01:59.956 --> 00:02:01.689
杰瑞，
Jerry,

25
00:02:01.725 --> 00:02:03.860
你不必那么努力工作。你要退休了。
you don't have to work so hard. You're retiring.

26
00:02:05.426 --> 00:02:06.898
嗯，是的。但是我
Well, yeah. But... I...

27
00:02:06.933 --> 00:02:09.299
我不必这样。嗯。。。
I don't have to be. Um...

28
00:02:09.334 --> 00:02:12.401
我知道我的电话正在关机，但是。。。
I know my line is shutting down, but...

29
00:02:12.436 --> 00:02:14.606
你知道，我喜欢数字。
You know, I have a thing with numbers.

30
00:02:14.641 --> 00:02:16.143
来吧
Come on.

31
00:02:16.179 --> 00:02:19.641
你已经服完刑了。这是你的黄金岁月。
You've served your time. These are your golden years.

32
00:02:19.676 --> 00:02:22.714
他是我们有过的最好的直线经理，对吗？
He's the best line manager we ever had, right?

33
00:02:22.749 --> 00:02:24.051
绝对地
Absolutely.

34
00:02:24.086 --> 00:02:26.350
嘿你为什么不告诉这些人
Hey. Why don't you tell these guys

35
00:02:26.386 --> 00:02:28.486
你高中时是怎么开始在这里工作的？
how you started working here in high school?

36
00:02:29.384 --> 00:02:31.951
你晚上工作，对吧？
You worked nights, right?

37
00:02:46.469 --> 00:02:48.239
-致Jerry。-好吧
- To Jerry. - All right.

38
00:02:48.274 --> 00:02:50.945
不是每个人都能活42年
Not everybody can pull off 42 years

39
00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:52.444
不会被解雇。
without getting fired.

40
00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:55.249
现在你有了一个老板，他会让你睡懒觉。
And now you have a boss who's going to let you sleep in.

41
00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:57.377
也不会对我大喊大叫。
And won't yell at me.

42
00:02:57.413 --> 00:02:58.717
这是错误的。哦
Wrong about that. Oh.

43
00:03:00.289 --> 00:03:02.382
你应该拿到房地产许可证，
You know, you should get your real estate license,

44
00:03:02.417 --> 00:03:04.054
就像霍华德那样。
just like Howard did.

45
00:03:04.089 --> 00:03:05.222
这就像有一份工作。
It's like having a job.

46
00:03:05.258 --> 00:03:07.059
但这也就像退休一样，
But it's also like being retired,

47
00:03:07.094 --> 00:03:08.894
因为你什么都不做。
because you don't do anything.

48
00:03:08.929 --> 00:03:10.295
这是真的。
It's true.

49
00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:11.925
大多数时候，我甚至不出门。
Most days, I don't even leave the house.

50
00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:13.999
好
Well...

51
00:03:14.034 --> 00:03:15.697
你知道，我会成功的。
You know, I'll make it work.

52
00:03:15.733 --> 00:03:18.466
你知道，我总是可以帮玛吉做家务。
You know, I can always help Marge around the house.

53
00:03:18.501 --> 00:03:20.234
不，你不需要那样做。
No, you don't need to do that.

54
00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:21.638
不，我很乐意。
No, I'd be happy to.

55
00:03:21.673 --> 00:03:24.008
我是说，你已经照顾这个地方很多年了。
I mean, you've been taking care of this place for years.

56
00:03:24.043 --> 00:03:25.307
我有一个系统。
I kind of have a system.

57
00:03:25.342 --> 00:03:26.906
哦，是的，很好。
Oh, yeah, and a good one.

58
00:03:26.942 --> 00:03:29.816
但是，你知道，每个系统都可以进行改进。
But, you know, every system can use an improvement.

59
00:03:29.851 --> 00:03:30.982
哦，天哪。我们开始吧。
Oh, God. Here we go.

60
00:03:31.018 --> 00:03:32.417
嘿我有个主意。是 啊
Hey. I got an idea. Yeah?

61
00:03:32.453 --> 00:03:35.553
为什么我不试着在你的一些工作网站上咨询一下呢？
Why don't I try consulting on some of your job sites?

62
00:03:35.588 --> 00:03:38.158
你知道，想办法让事情变得更好。啊。
You know, find ways of making things run better. Ah.

63
00:03:38.193 --> 00:03:40.490
你想在我的工地上走走吗
You wanna walk around on my construction site

64
00:03:40.525 --> 00:03:42.928
告诉我我做错了什么？噢。
and tell me what I'm doing wrong? Oof.

65
00:03:42.963 --> 00:03:44.096
我不会收太多钱。
I wouldn't charge much.

66
00:03:44.131 --> 00:03:45.431
哦，我得付钱给你？
Oh, and I have to pay you for this?

67
00:03:45.466 --> 00:03:46.795
该死的对。你也要过来吗
Darn right. Are you going to also come by

68
00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:49.335
教我妻子如何评分？
and teach my wife how to grade papers?

69
00:03:49.371 --> 00:03:51.771
嘿，爸爸，如果我住在这里，我会欢迎的。
Hey, Dad, if I lived here, I would welcome that.

70
00:03:51.806 --> 00:03:53.269
谢谢你，道恩。
Thank you, Dawn.

71
00:03:53.304 --> 00:03:54.504
我会接受你的。
I'm gonna take you up on that.

72
00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:56.805
我要经常开车去大急流城。
I'm gonna drive down to Grand Rapids more often.

73
00:03:57.206 --> 00:03:58.504
哦，哎哟。
Oh, whoops.

74
00:03:58.539 --> 00:03:59.574
你卖的太好了。
You sold it too well.

75
00:03:59.609 --> 00:04:00.880
闭嘴。就在你面前发生了事与愿违的事。
Shut up. Backfired right in your face.

76
00:04:00.915 --> 00:04:01.946
是吗，亲爱的？可以
Yeah, sweetie? Okay.

77
00:04:01.982 --> 00:04:03.248
我们能展示流行音乐吗？
Can we show Pop Pop?

78
00:04:03.284 --> 00:04:05.883
嗯，是的，你想现在就给我看流行音乐吗？
Uh, yeah, you wanna show Pop Pop right now?

79
00:04:05.919 --> 00:04:06.980
给我看什么？
Show me what?

80
00:04:07.015 --> 00:04:09.787
我们给你买了一份退休礼物。惊喜
We got you a retirement present. Surprise.

81
00:04:09.822 --> 00:04:11.683
可以
Okay.

82
00:04:11.719 --> 00:04:13.319
睁开你的眼睛。打开
Open your eyes. Open.

83
00:04:13.355 --> 00:04:15.123
天哪！
Holy cow!

84
00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:19.366
渔船。什么
A fishing boat. What...

85
00:04:19.402 --> 00:04:22.399
我喜欢钓鱼吗？我愿意？可以是的，你带过我一次。
Do I like fishing? I do? Okay. Yeah, you took me once.

86
00:04:22.435 --> 00:04:24.003
是的，现在你想去哪里就去哪里。
Yeah, now you can go whenever you want.

87
00:04:24.038 --> 00:04:25.537
是的，怎么样？
Yeah, how about that?

88
00:04:26.601 --> 00:04:28.474
这太棒了。非常感谢。
This is great. Thank you.

89
00:04:28.509 --> 00:04:31.242
谢谢，谢谢，谢谢。哦，很好。
Thank you, thank you, thank you. Oh, good.

90
00:04:31.278 --> 00:04:32.539
哦爸爸喜欢。
Oh. Dad likes it.

91
00:04:32.574 --> 00:04:35.041
还有你，为了保守秘密。
And you, for keeping a secret.

92
00:04:36.544 --> 00:04:37.676
谢谢你，南瓜。
Thank you, pumpkin.

93
00:04:37.711 --> 00:04:38.952
谢谢你，道格。你喜欢吗？
Thank you, Doug. You like it?

94
00:04:38.987 --> 00:04:40.354
-是的。-好吧
- Yeah. - All right.

95
00:04:40.755 --> 00:04:41.750
天哪
My goodness.

96
00:04:41.785 --> 00:04:44.117
天哪干得好你没有破坏它。
My goodness. Good job. You didn't spoil it.

97
00:04:44.152 --> 00:04:46.789
那是你唯一的工作。你做得很好。你没事吧？
That was your one job. You did so good. You okay?

98
00:04:47.829 --> 00:04:49.959
哦，是的。是 啊
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

99
00:04:54.268 --> 00:04:57.233
我没有很多普通的衣服。
I don't have many regular clothes.

100
00:04:57.268 --> 00:04:59.205
都是工作服。
It's all work shirts.

101
00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:00.903
好吧，我们可以给你买更多的衣服。
Well, we can get you more clothes.

102
00:05:00.939 --> 00:05:01.936
隐马尔可夫模型。
Hmm.

103
00:05:04.011 --> 00:05:05.511
这将是一种调整。
It'll be an adjustment.

104
00:05:06.211 --> 00:05:07.447
你会找到你的路的。
You'll find your way.

105
00:05:07.946 --> 00:05:09.209
隐马尔可夫模型。
Hmm.

106
00:05:09.245 --> 00:05:10.545
有你？
Have you?

107
00:05:10.581 --> 00:05:12.485
不是真的。但我没有船。
Not really. But I don't have a boat.

108
00:05:15.186 --> 00:05:16.522
你想要这个？
You want this one?

109
00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:18.117
不。
Nope.

110
00:05:52.027 --> 00:05:54.120
早上好Leon。早上好，杰瑞。
Morning, Leon. Morning, Jerry.

111
00:06:01.302 --> 00:06:04.032
海伦，信用卡被拒绝了。我很抱歉。
Card was declined, Helen. I'm sorry.

112
00:06:04.068 --> 00:06:07.705
该死的。也许我有现金。让我只是。。。
Dang it. Maybe I have cash. Let me just...

113
00:06:11.312 --> 00:06:12.978
我知道你很擅长。
I know you're good for it.

114
00:06:13.014 --> 00:06:14.140
谢谢你，里昂。
Thanks, Leon.

115
00:06:27.227 --> 00:06:29.095
你在外面干什么？
What are you doing out here?

116
00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:30.362
0
00.

117
00:06:30.397 --> 00:06:32.225
不，你说的是00。
No, you said 00.

118
00:06:32.261 --> 00:06:34.701
我没有其他约会。我有六个客户。
I don't have any other appointments. I have six clients.

119
00:06:34.736 --> 00:06:35.830
可以
Okay.

120
00:06:35.865 --> 00:06:38.198
只有六个客户你怎么谋生？
How do you make a living with only six clients?

121
00:06:38.234 --> 00:06:42.003
我没有。我刚成为一名在线旅行社。看到海报了吗？
I don't. I just became an online travel agent. See the posters?

122
00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:45.478
哦，是的。
Oh, yeah.

123
00:06:45.513 --> 00:06:49.246
那么，如果是在线的，你为什么需要海报呢？
So, why do you need posters if it's online?

124
00:06:49.281 --> 00:06:50.981
因为他们是自由的。
Because they were free.

125
00:06:51.017 --> 00:06:54.182
为什么你总是要理解一切背后的道理？
Why do you always have to understand the reasoning behind everything?

126
00:06:54.217 --> 00:06:55.422
哦，好吧。
Oh, well.

127
00:06:55.457 --> 00:06:57.986
这是我理解事物的唯一方式。
It's the only way I can make sense of things.

128
00:06:59.158 --> 00:07:00.219
船怎么样了？
How's the boat?

129
00:07:01.095 --> 00:07:02.958
水还是太冷了。
Water's still too cold.

130
00:07:02.994 --> 00:07:06.263
你不能下水。这就是船的意义所在。
You don't get in the water. That's the point of the boat.

131
00:07:06.298 --> 00:07:08.462
嗯，我的账户怎么样？
Hmm. How's my account?

132
00:07:08.497 --> 00:07:09.965
说到寒冷。。。
Speaking of cold...

133
00:07:11.938 --> 00:07:13.065
2%收益，
2% gains,

134
00:07:13.101 --> 00:07:16.176
这听起来不太像，因为它不是。
which doesn't sound like much, because it isn't.

135
00:07:16.212 --> 00:07:17.941
听着，你要更有侵略性。
Look, you gotta be more aggressive.

136
00:07:17.977 --> 00:07:21.006
如果你让我把它投进股票，我可能会给你10%。
If you let me put that in stocks, I could probably get you 10%.

137
00:07:21.041 --> 00:07:24.444
那只会让你的钱翻一番。。。
That would double your money in only...

138
00:07:24.479 --> 00:07:26.520
7.27年。
7.27 years.

139
00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:30.955
实际上，这是我今天唯一一次使用它。
Literally the only time I was going to get to use that today.

140
00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:32.322
不。
Nope.

141
00:07:32.357 --> 00:07:33.854
我们只有这些了。
This is all we've got.

142
00:07:33.889 --> 00:07:35.595
我不会拿它来赌博。
And I'm not about to gamble with it.

143
00:07:35.631 --> 00:07:37.992
这不是赌博。这似乎是一种风险，但市场。。。
It's not gambling. It seems like a risk, but the market...

144
00:07:38.028 --> 00:07:41.995
是啊，如果你输了，那就是赌博。
Yeah, well, if you could lose it, it's gambling.

145
00:07:42.031 --> 00:07:43.764
一个月后我会打电话给你，准备下次约会。
I'll call you in a month for my next appointment.

146
00:07:43.799 --> 00:07:45.638
不需要预约。可以
Don't need an appointment. Okay.

147
00:07:46.436 --> 00:07:47.739
把船拿出来。
Take out the boat.

148
00:07:48.803 --> 00:07:50.511
我可以这么做。
I may just do that.

149
00:08:19.841 --> 00:08:21.036
哦
Oh!

150
00:08:23.405 --> 00:08:24.570
不
No.

151
00:08:34.285 --> 00:08:36.018
天哪！
Holy cow!

152
00:08:45.660 --> 00:08:46.930
嘿Jer。
Hey, Jer.

153
00:08:50.071 --> 00:08:53.304
-什么是滚降当头奖达到200万的时候
- What's a roll down? - It's when the jackpot hits two million

154
00:08:53.340 --> 00:08:54.834
没有人能得到六个数字。
and nobody gets six numbers.

155
00:08:54.870 --> 00:08:56.805
然后整个头奖滚了下来
Then the whole jackpot rolls down

156
00:08:56.840 --> 00:08:58.944
给那些有三个或四个。。。
to the people who got three or four...

157
00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:00.310
无论什么
Whatever.

158
00:09:00.345 --> 00:09:01.774
只是可能性更大。
Just better odds.

159
00:09:01.810 --> 00:09:03.914
祝你好运是 啊谢谢
Good luck. Yeah. Thanks.

160
00:09:04.580 --> 00:09:06.051
可能性更大。
Better odds.

161
00:09:57.732 --> 00:09:59.200
这是对的吗？
Can that be right?

162
00:10:01.042 --> 00:10:02.170
好吧
All right.

163
00:10:10.316 --> 00:10:12.344
这不是赌博。
It's not gambling.

164
00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:16.288
彩票？是的。每次都有办法赢。
The lottery? Yup. There's a way to win every time.

165
00:10:16.323 --> 00:10:17.387
你中风了吗？
Are you having a stroke?

166
00:10:17.422 --> 00:10:18.692
有个漏洞
There's a loophole

167
00:10:18.727 --> 00:10:20.358
他们没有看到，这就在数学中。
they didn't see, and it's right here in the math.

168
00:10:20.393 --> 00:10:22.357
现在，在一张典型的图纸上，
Now, on a typical drawing,

169
00:10:22.392 --> 00:10:26.829
你有54分之一的机会打出六个数字中的三个，
you'd have a one in 54 chance of hitting three out of six numbers,

170
00:10:26.865 --> 00:10:30.336
1500分之一的几率命中4个。
and a one in 1,500 chance of hitting four.

171
00:10:30.372 --> 00:10:31.797
你很可能每次都会输。
Odds are you'll lose every time.

172
00:10:31.832 --> 00:10:32.968
不是每次。
Not every time.

173
00:10:33.003 --> 00:10:35.407
上周我赢了一张免费票，但输了。
I won a free ticket last week, which lost.

174
00:10:35.442 --> 00:10:37.442
但在滚动周，
But on the roll down weeks,

175
00:10:37.478 --> 00:10:39.306
对较低数字的支付
the payouts to the lower numbers

176
00:10:39.341 --> 00:10:43.745
超过您将支付的玩游戏的金额。
increases above the amount that you would pay to play.

177
00:10:43.780 --> 00:10:46.720
所以，数学对你有利。
So, the math is in your favor.

178
00:10:47.255 --> 00:10:48.080
他们错过了。
And they missed it.

179
00:10:48.116 --> 00:10:50.021
我不知道这是怎么说的。
I don't know what this says.

180
00:10:50.056 --> 00:10:53.185
看起来像是一个疯子在牢房墙上画的数字。
Looks like the numbers a crazy man drew on his cell wall.

181
00:10:53.220 --> 00:10:54.854
这意味着在降级周，
It means that on the roll down weeks,

182
00:10:54.889 --> 00:10:56.525
你一定会赢。
you're guaranteed to win.

183
00:10:56.561 --> 00:10:58.257
那不可能是真的。
That can't be true.

184
00:10:58.293 --> 00:11:01.534
为什么不呢？因为这是彩票，杰瑞。
Why not? Because it's the lottery, Jerry.

185
00:11:01.569 --> 00:11:03.068
底特律有一栋大楼
There's a building of people in Detroit

186
00:11:03.103 --> 00:11:06.168
他们的工作是了解数字是如何工作的。他们确实如此。
whose job it is to know how the numbers work. And they do.

187
00:11:07.476 --> 00:11:10.711
我不敢相信你是我的会计。
I cannot believe you are my accountant.

188
00:11:11.477 --> 00:11:12.643
兼职会计。
Part-time accountant.

189
00:11:12.678 --> 00:11:14.880
全职在线旅行社。
Full-time online travel agent.

190
00:11:23.388 --> 00:11:24.490
嘿Mindy。
Hey, Mindy.

191
00:11:24.525 --> 00:11:26.455
嘿Jerry。存款？
Hey, Jerry. Making a deposit?

192
00:11:26.491 --> 00:11:28.454
呃，不。。。我
Uh, no... I...

193
00:11:29.958 --> 00:11:32.491
我想提取2000美元。
I'd like to withdraw $2,000.

194
00:11:33.166 --> 00:11:34.163
是的。
Yep.

195
00:11:36.304 --> 00:11:38.136
那么，你的脚怎么样了？
So, how are your feet?

196
00:11:38.172 --> 00:11:39.571
更好了。
Been better.

197
00:11:39.607 --> 00:11:41.039
滚动网球有助于，
Rolling the tennis ball helped,

198
00:11:41.075 --> 00:11:43.606
直到我的经理被它绊倒，扔到街上。
until my manager tripped on it and threw it into the street.

199
00:11:43.642 --> 00:11:45.037
我可以再给你拿一个。
I can bring you another one.

200
00:11:45.073 --> 00:11:47.209
他们三人一组。谢谢
They come in threes. Thanks.

201
00:11:51.681 --> 00:11:52.983
哦，谢谢你。
Oh, thank you.

202
00:11:53.019 --> 00:11:55.680
几天后我会带着押金回来。
I'll be back in a couple of days with a deposit.

203
00:11:55.716 --> 00:11:56.922
可以
Okay.

204
00:11:59.191 --> 00:12:00.019
哦
Oh.

205
00:12:00.055 --> 00:12:03.393
可能比这个多20%。
Probably be 20% more than this.

206
00:12:03.429 --> 00:12:04.495
给予或索取。
Give or take.

207
00:12:04.530 --> 00:12:05.931
到时候见。可以
See you then. Okay.

208
00:12:32.491 --> 00:12:33.888
非常感谢。
Thank you.

209
00:12:33.923 --> 00:12:35.895
可以祝您今天过得愉快。
Okay. Have a good day.

210
00:12:41.535 --> 00:12:43.463
两千张WinFall门票。
Two thousand WinFall tickets.

211
00:12:44.866 --> 00:12:46.136
两千？
Two thousand?

212
00:12:46.636 --> 00:12:47.907
是的，女士。
Yes, ma'am.

213
00:12:55.010 --> 00:12:59.919
各位晚上好，欢迎参加本周的WinFall彩票发行。
Good evening, folks, and welcome to this week's WinFall lottery roll down.

215
00:13:03.722 --> 00:13:06.953
第一个幸运数字是六。
The first lucky number is six.

216
00:13:06.988 --> 00:13:08.862
第二个数字。。。

00:13:10.958 --> 00:13:12.327
二十三。
Twenty-three.

218
00:13:13.228 --> 00:13:15.297
你没事吧？哦，是的。再好不过了。
You okay? Oh, yeah. Never better.

219
00:13:17.402 --> 00:13:19.235
43岁。那么，船怎么样了？
 Forty-three. So, how'd it go with the boat?

220
00:13:19.834 --> 00:13:21.171
哦，呃。。。
Oh, uh...

221
00:13:21.207 --> 00:13:25.408
他们说他们可以修马达，但这不是给我的。
They said they can fix the motor, but it's not for me.

222
00:13:25.444 --> 00:13:28.107
我是说，我们应该一起做些事情，对吧？
I mean, we're supposed to be doing stuff together anyway, right?

223
00:13:28.142 --> 00:13:29.843
三十一。
 Thirty-one.

224
00:13:29.879 --> 00:13:31.611
你想看电影吗？下一个中奖号码是。。。

225
00:13:31.647 --> 00:13:35.548
哦不，我不是说现在。十
Oh... No, I didn't mean right now.  Ten.

226
00:13:36.823 --> 00:13:39.051
那么，什么时候？嗯，我不知道。
Well, so, when? Well, I don't know.

227
00:13:39.086 --> 00:13:40.586
我正在看一个节目。
I'm watching a program.

228
00:13:41.495 --> 00:13:42.523
你在看这个？
You're watching this?

229
00:13:42.559 --> 00:13:43.591
不
No.

230
00:13:57.344 --> 00:14:01.711
四十三、三十一、十和三十二岁。

And we hope you're a winner.

232
00:14:04.350 --> 00:14:05.446
一
One...

233
00:14:07.982 --> 00:14:09.615
那是四分之一。
That's one's four.

235

十六
Sixteen.

236
00:14:27.203 --> 00:14:29.936
问题是，没有人知道这个城镇。
Problem is, nobody knows about this town.

237
00:14:29.971 --> 00:14:33.709
埃瓦特应该开始以一美元的价格出售房屋，就像在托斯卡纳一样。
Evart should start selling houses for a dollar, like they do in Tuscany.

238
00:14:33.744 --> 00:14:35.308
在这里吸引人。
Lure people here.

239
00:14:35.343 --> 00:14:37.316
我们可以花一美元住在托斯卡纳？
We can live in Tuscany for a dollar?

240
00:14:37.352 --> 00:14:38.616
嗯，一欧元。
Well, a Euro.

241
00:14:38.652 --> 00:14:39.850
那是一美元。
That's a dollar.

242
00:14:39.886 --> 00:14:41.916
不，比这多一点。
No, a little more than that.

243
00:14:41.952 --> 00:14:43.517
杰瑞，一欧元多少钱？
Jerry, how much is a Euro?

244
00:14:47.492 --> 00:14:48.489
杰瑞。
Jerry.

245
00:14:49.593 --> 00:14:50.590
哦
Oh.

246
00:14:51.397 --> 00:14:52.394
很抱歉
Sorry.

247
00:14:53.795 --> 00:14:55.133
嗯。
Mmm.

248
00:14:56.029 --> 00:14:57.267
座无虚席。
Full house.

249
00:14:57.999 --> 00:14:59.534
我们在玩杜松子酒。
We're playing gin.

250
00:14:59.570 --> 00:15:01.007
哦
Oh.

251
00:15:07.512 --> 00:15:09.980
-非常感谢你。-好吧嗯，晚安。
- Thank you so much. - All right. Well, goodnight.

252

-晚安。-当心。
- Goodnight. - Take care.

253
00:15:11.446 --> 00:15:13.514
好好走回家。可以
Have a good walk home. Okay.

254
00:15:14.382 --> 00:15:16.048
杜松子酒、扑克或克里贝奇，
Gin, or poker, or cribbage,

255
00:15:16.083 --> 00:15:18.023
我被他们弄糊涂了。你不在乎。你不在乎。
I get confused by them all. You don't care. You don't care.

256
00:15:18.058 --> 00:15:20.327
乱摸。下一步拼字。
Scrabble. Scrabble next.

257
00:15:20.362 --> 00:15:21.489
好吧，晚安。
All right, night.

258
00:15:23.361 --> 00:15:25.631
你得告诉我发生了什么事。
You're going to have to tell me what's going on.

259
00:15:25.667 --> 00:15:27.594
我太老了，等不及了。
I'm too old to wait it out.

260
00:15:30.799 --> 00:15:32.005
哦
Oh...

261
00:15:33.739 --> 00:15:35.404
我错过了机会。
I missed my chance.

262
00:15:37.879 --> 00:15:39.573
我做了我应该做的一切。
I did everything I was supposed to do.

263
00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:41.641
我必须做的一切。
Everything I had to do.

264
00:15:43.114 --> 00:15:45.546
现在做任何事情都为时已晚。
Now it's too late to do anything else.

265
00:15:46.588 --> 00:15:49.649
哦，你的生活还没有结束。
Oh, your life isn't over.

266
00:15:54.421 --> 00:15:56.359
每个人似乎都这么认为。
Everybody seems to think it is.

267
00:15:56.759 --> 00:15:57.998
好
Well...

268
00:16:00.161 --> 00:16:02.134
见鬼，我什么都能做。
Heck, I can do anything.

269
00:16:02.169 --> 00:16:05.005
如果他们不切断我的生产线，我还会在工厂。
I'd still be at the factory if they didn't cut my line.

270
00:16:06.936 --> 00:16:08.470
但是相反。。。
But instead...

271
00:16:09.841 --> 00:16:12.707
这是我的黄金岁月。
These are my golden years.

272
00:16:12.743 --> 00:16:15.812
是的，只是因为事情没有按你想要的方式发展，
Yeah, just because things didn't work out the way you wanted,

273
00:16:15.847 --> 00:16:17.816
并不意味着他们不会。
doesn't mean they won't.

274
00:16:17.851 --> 00:16:20.152
好运会发生，坏事也会发生。
Good luck happens, same as bad.

275
00:16:25.359 --> 00:16:26.356
什么
What?

276
00:16:27.323 --> 00:16:30.423
祝你好运，这和坏运气一样吗？
Good luck, it happens same as bad?

277
00:16:30.458 --> 00:16:33.391
是 啊这只是数学。是 啊
Yeah. It's just math. Yeah.

278
00:16:33.427 --> 00:16:36.630
什么哦，老兄。真是个傻瓜。
What? Oh, man. What a dummy.

279
00:16:37.636 --> 00:16:38.934
不是你。我
Not you. Me.

280
00:16:38.970 --> 00:16:41.239
你是个天才。
You're a genius.

281
00:16:43.072 --> 00:16:44.608
样本量。
Sample size.

282
00:16:46.274 --> 00:16:48.575
这就是我错的地方。
That is where I went wrong.

283
00:16:48.611 --> 00:16:52.151
我没有计算概率的频率。
I didn't calculate the frequency of probability.

284
00:16:52.619 --> 00:16:53.685
这只是数学。
It's just math.

285
00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:55.587
哦，我不喜欢数学。
Oh, I don't like math.

286
00:16:55.622 --> 00:16:57.623
哦哦，对不起。
Oh. Oh, I'm sorry.

287
00:16:57.658 --> 00:17:00.792
来，让我给你看看。。。
Here, let me show you...

288
00:17:00.828 --> 00:17:03.059
在这里如果你拿一枚硬币
Here. So, if you take a coin

289
00:17:03.095 --> 00:17:05.357
你把它翻了1000次，
and you flipped it 1,000 times,

290
00:17:05.392 --> 00:17:08.566
你可能仍然有60%的人头。
you might still get 60% heads.

291
00:17:08.601 --> 00:17:15.100
但是如果你把它翻了5000次，概率就会接近50%。
But if you flipped it 5,000 times, the probability gets closer to 50%.

292
00:17:15.136 --> 00:17:19.274
样本必须足够大，以便从方程中排除运气。
The sample has to be large enough to take luck out of the equation.

293
00:17:19.309 --> 00:17:22.247
这是给你的。
And this is for you.

294
00:17:23.047 --> 00:17:25.683
你要存一分钱吗？
Are you depositing a penny?

295
00:17:25.718 --> 00:17:28.418
不，不。
No. No.

296
00:17:28.786 --> 00:17:29.782
不，呃。。。
No. Uh...

297
00:17:30.758 --> 00:17:32.521
我想提款。
I wanna make a withdrawal.

298
00:17:33.086 --> 00:17:35.656
$4,200.
$4,200.

299
00:17:37.295 --> 00:17:39.091
哦，这给我们留下了多少？
Oh, and how much does that leave us with?

300
00:17:39.127 --> 00:17:41.332
我正在检查。
I am checking.

301
00:17:43.638 --> 00:17:45.336
四点多一点。
A little over four.

302
00:17:45.736 --> 00:17:46.733
可以
Okay.

303
00:17:49.808 --> 00:17:51.540
那就定在六点吧。
Make it six, then.

304
00:17:52.679 --> 00:17:53.740
六嗯哼。
Six? Mmm-hmm.

305
00:18:01.216 --> 00:18:03.717
八
Eight?

306
00:18:05.659 --> 00:18:06.852
八个$8,000.
Eight? $8,000.

307
00:18:07.662 --> 00:18:08.689
你确定吗？隐马尔可夫模型。
Are you sure? Hmm.

308
00:18:11.864 --> 00:18:13.059
九十八。
Ninety-eight.

309
00:18:17.199 --> 00:18:18.699
99
Ninety-nine.

310
00:18:20.806 --> 00:18:22.439
8000人。
Eight thousand.

311
00:18:24.777 --> 00:18:25.871
谢谢你，米奇。
Thank you, Midge.

312
00:18:26.547 --> 00:18:27.611
我们开始了。
There we go.

313
00:18:27.646 --> 00:18:28.643
再见
Bye-bye.

314
00:18:30.645 --> 00:18:32.848
你知道，每个城镇都有自己的特色。
You know, every town has a thing.

315
00:18:32.884 --> 00:18:34.248
我们需要一件事。
We need a thing.

316
00:18:34.283 --> 00:18:36.121
爵士音乐节怎么了？
What happened to jazz fest?

317
00:18:36.157 --> 00:18:38.686
嗯，我们无法保持舞台符合规范。
Well, we couldn't keep the stage up to code.

318
00:18:38.721 --> 00:18:41.086
哦，其中一个堵塞器女孩摔了一跤。
Oh, one of those clogger girls fell right through.

319
00:18:41.122 --> 00:18:42.489
哦，是的。
Oh, yeah.

320
00:18:42.524 --> 00:18:43.856
爵士音乐节也赚钱了。
Jazz fest made money, too.

321
00:18:43.891 --> 00:18:46.791
我是说，不是那年，因为那个女孩起诉了我们。是 啊
I mean, not that year, because the girl sued us. Yeah.

322
00:18:46.827 --> 00:18:49.231
她很难过，因为我们还在鼓掌。
She was upset 'cause we were still clapping.

323
00:18:49.267 --> 00:18:51.264
我们以为这是表演的一部分。
We thought it was part of the show.

324
00:18:51.299 --> 00:18:52.566
哦
Oh.

325
00:18:52.602 --> 00:18:54.399
顺便说一下，我们一群人正在集资
By the way, a bunch of us are pooling money

326
00:18:54.434 --> 00:18:56.474
今晚的彩票。
for the lottery tonight.

327
00:18:56.509 --> 00:18:59.039
他们在做滚降，这样你可以赢得更多。
They're doing that roll down thing, where you can win more.

328
00:18:59.074 --> 00:19:02.115
我们不是买彩票的人。这可能是最好的。
We're not lottery people. That's probably for the best.

329
00:19:02.150 --> 00:19:04.014
你知道，有些人吹了几千次
You know, there are some people who blow thousands

330
00:19:04.049 --> 00:19:05.545
在那些事情上？
on those things?

331
00:19:05.580 --> 00:19:07.146
你没事吧？我们开始吧。
You all right? Here we go.

332
00:19:07.181 --> 00:19:08.551
怎么了喝点饮料。走错了路。
What's the matter? Take the drink. Down the wrong pipe.

333
00:19:09.118 --> 00:19:10.250
吃得太快了。
Eating too fast.

334
00:19:12.187 --> 00:19:13.391
是 啊
Yeah.

335
00:19:16.529 --> 00:19:17.527
哦。
Ooh.

336
00:19:19.060 --> 00:19:20.431
四
Four.

337
00:19:38.552 --> 00:19:39.549
哇哦。
Whoo.

338
00:20:01.209 --> 00:20:02.806
我是说，这就像一家普通的旅行社，
I mean, it's like a regular travel agent,

339
00:20:02.842 --> 00:20:03.876
但它是在线的，
but it's online,

340
00:20:03.911 --> 00:20:05.076
所以人们可以像动物一样行动
so people can act like animals

341
00:20:05.112 --> 00:20:06.274
当事情不顺利的时候。
when something doesn't work out.

342
00:20:06.309 --> 00:20:08.073
嘿，你应该去旅行。
Hey, you should be traveling.

343
00:20:08.108 --> 00:20:10.742
你和Wendy过去常去游轮然后回来
You and Wendy used to go on all these cruises and come back

344
00:20:10.777 --> 00:20:12.118
把一切都称为左舷和右舷。
and call everything port and starboard.

345
00:20:12.153 --> 00:20:13.479
我甚至不知道哪个是哪个。
I didn't even know which was which.

346
00:20:13.514 --> 00:20:15.547
取决于你所处的海洋。
Depends which ocean you're on.

347
00:20:15.582 --> 00:20:18.120
嗯，不，不，是的。
Hmm. No. No. Yep.

348
00:20:18.156 --> 00:20:19.924
她希望你玩得开心。
She'd want you to have fun.

349
00:20:19.959 --> 00:20:21.555
已经三年了。
It's been three years.

350
00:20:21.590 --> 00:20:23.590
哦，小子们。小鬼和汉堡。全部的
Oh, brats. Brats and burgers. All?

351
00:20:23.625 --> 00:20:25.062
上面有奶酪。可以
With cheese on it. Okay.

352
00:20:25.098 --> 00:20:26.463
小鬼和。。。哦切达干酪？
Brats and... Oh. Cheddar?

353
00:20:26.498 --> 00:20:28.395
道格，你能看一下烤肉架吗？
Doug, would you watch the grill for a second?

354
00:20:28.430 --> 00:20:30.433
看见这是一个好时机。嗯？
See? This is a good time. Huh?

355
00:20:30.468 --> 00:20:32.300
嗯。我告诉过你开车去是值得的。
Mmm. I told you it'd be worth the drive.

356
00:20:32.335 --> 00:20:33.499
不，你说你不知道
No, you said you didn't know

357
00:20:33.535 --> 00:20:35.102
你还剩多少个周末。
how many weekends you have left.

358
00:20:35.138 --> 00:20:36.339
嗯，我不知道。
Well, I don't.

359
00:20:36.375 --> 00:20:39.540
是的，但数学是可行的。
Yeah, but the math works.

360
00:20:39.575 --> 00:20:41.308
开车两个小时，买一个免费的汉堡。
Drive for two hours, get a free burger.

361
00:20:41.343 --> 00:20:42.782
抵消了汽油的成本。
Offsets the cost of gas.

362
00:20:42.817 --> 00:20:44.148
爸爸，我不吃肉。
I don't eat meat, Dad.

363
00:20:44.184 --> 00:20:45.817
哦，对了。我去拿鸡肉。
Oh, right. I'll get the chicken.

364
00:20:45.853 --> 00:20:47.147
不，那还是肉。
No, that's still meat.

365
00:20:47.182 --> 00:20:48.453
可以
Okay.

366
00:20:49.085 --> 00:20:50.356
他没事吧？
Is he okay?

367
00:20:50.391 --> 00:20:54.157
他只是不知道“我想你”的公式
He just doesn't know the formula for "I miss you."

368
00:20:54.193 --> 00:20:55.426
你在这里会更有趣。
It is more fun when you're here.

369
00:20:55.462 --> 00:20:58.058
我知道，但你和爸爸，你必须在一起玩得开心。
I know, but you and Dad, you gotta have fun together.

370
00:20:58.093 --> 00:20:59.197
是 啊
Yeah.

371
00:20:59.232 --> 00:21:00.427
我知道你等了很久了
I know you've waited a really long time

372
00:21:00.462 --> 00:21:02.396
让他退休。我知道。
for him to retire. I know.

373
00:21:02.431 --> 00:21:04.699
我知道。我们需要努力。
I know. We need to work on it.

374
00:21:04.734 --> 00:21:07.973
我甚至不记得我们最后一次。。。
I can't even remember the last time that we had...

375
00:21:08.008 --> 00:21:09.903
你知道的？什么
You know? What?

376
00:21:09.939 --> 00:21:12.070
是 啊哦，不，没关系。我不想听到关于。。。
Yeah. Oh, no, that's okay. I don't need to hear about...

377
00:21:12.745 --> 00:21:13.945
蜂蜜
Honey.

378
00:21:13.980 --> 00:21:15.344
我去喝杯啤酒。
I'm gonna get a beer.

379
00:21:15.379 --> 00:21:17.249
可以可以我们会努力的。
Okay? Okay. We'll work on it.

380
00:21:17.284 --> 00:21:19.279
反正我也在考虑。可以
I'm thinking about it anyway. Okay.

381
00:21:19.314 --> 00:21:20.650
我希望他会。
I wish he would.

382
00:21:22.755 --> 00:21:23.851
哇哦。
Whoa.

383
00:21:24.352 --> 00:21:25.455
哇，哇，哇！
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

384
00:21:25.490 --> 00:21:28.225
不，丽萃，丽萃，丽萃！不不不Liz。
No, Lizzy, Lizzy, Lizzy! No, no, no, no, Liz.

385
00:21:28.261 --> 00:21:30.294
我们不要。。。我们不要打开它。
Let's not... Let's not open that.

386
00:21:30.330 --> 00:21:32.726
为什么？我想要爆米花。我知道。我知道。
Why? I want the popcorn. I know. I know.

387
00:21:32.761 --> 00:21:35.899
但是这个。。。这爆米花很陈了。呃。
But this... this popcorn's very stale. Ugh.

388
00:21:35.935 --> 00:21:37.866
我喜欢陈腐的。
I like stale.

389
00:21:37.901 --> 00:21:41.005
嗯，但这里面全是糖。这对你没有好处。
Well, but this is full of sugar. It's no good for you.

390
00:21:41.041 --> 00:21:43.838
我看见你吃了七个奥利奥。
I saw you eat seven Oreos.

391
00:21:45.175 --> 00:21:46.373
你要奥利奥吗？
You want an Oreo?

392
00:21:46.409 --> 00:21:47.941
你把它们都吃了，爸爸。
You ate them all, Pop Pop.

393
00:21:49.378 --> 00:21:51.414
可以好吧嗯
Okay. All right. Uh...

394
00:21:51.449 --> 00:21:53.747
给我一分钟。
Let me just have it for one minute.

395
00:21:53.783 --> 00:21:55.955
爸爸会还给你的。我保证。
Pop Pop will give it back to you. I promise.

396
00:21:55.990 --> 00:21:58.155
你现在相信爸爸了，对吧？
You trust Pop Pop now, right?

397
00:21:58.190 --> 00:22:00.354
让我休息一下。
Let me just take one minute.

398
00:22:00.389 --> 00:22:01.724
我马上就出来。
And I'll be right out.

399
00:22:16.271 --> 00:22:18.042
干得好。
Here you go.

400
00:22:18.077 --> 00:22:20.413
拿谢谢，爸爸。
Take. Thanks, Pop Pop.

401
00:22:21.274 --> 00:22:22.547
是的。
Yep.

402
00:22:40.001 --> 00:22:41.434
你有什么想告诉我的吗？
Something you wanna tell me?

403
00:22:42.263 --> 00:22:43.769
什么
What?

404
00:22:43.804 --> 00:22:44.833
食品储藏室。
The pantry.

405
00:22:50.076 --> 00:22:51.741
我在买彩票。
I'm playing the lottery.

406
00:22:53.676 --> 00:22:55.811
我是说那袋空的奥利奥。
I meant the empty bag of Oreos.

407
00:22:59.781 --> 00:23:03.519
我在买彩票，我中奖了。
I'm playing the lottery, and I'm winning.

408
00:23:03.555 --> 00:23:06.820
我算出来了，赢了15000美元。
I figured out the math, and I won $15,000.

409
00:23:06.856 --> 00:23:09.858
它被塞进了磨砂迷你小麦盒子里。
It's stuffed inside the Frosted Mini-Wheats box.

410
00:23:10.995 --> 00:23:12.091
哇！
Wow.

411
00:23:17.866 --> 00:23:20.668
我给雪莉的彩票池20美元。
I gave $20 to Shirley's lottery pool.

412
00:23:20.703 --> 00:23:23.036
我想现在没什么大不了的。
I guess it's not such a big deal now.

413
00:23:25.240 --> 00:23:26.545
我
I...

414
00:23:26.980 --> 00:23:28.510
我不得不试试。
I had to try it.

415
00:23:28.546 --> 00:23:31.283
我我在游戏中发现了这个缺陷，
I... I found this flaw in the game,

416
00:23:31.318 --> 00:23:34.384
我必须找出我是否是对的。
and I had to find out if I was right.

417
00:23:34.419 --> 00:23:36.148
那你为什么不告诉我？
Well, why didn't you just tell me?

418
00:23:36.858 --> 00:23:39.889
我觉得很傻。
I... felt silly.

419
00:23:39.924 --> 00:23:43.694
我们几乎没有足够的钱退休，而且。。。
We barely have enough money to retire on as it is, and...

420
00:23:44.329 --> 00:23:45.960
现在不是冒险的时候。
This is no time to risk it.

421
00:23:48.332 --> 00:23:50.101
是的，是的。什么
Yes, it is. What?

422
00:23:50.136 --> 00:23:51.301
是时候冒险了。
It's time to risk it.

423
00:23:51.336 --> 00:23:52.666
因为现在我们输了
Because right now we're losing

424
00:23:52.702 --> 00:23:54.705
更重要的事情。
something that matters even more.

425
00:23:55.739 --> 00:23:58.177
我等了40年，只为我们，
I've waited 40 years for it to be just us,

426
00:23:58.213 --> 00:24:00.579
到目前为止，我们在这方面有点差劲。
and so far we kind of suck at it.

427
00:24:01.674 --> 00:24:02.775
我们有危险。
We have Jeopardy.

428
00:24:02.810 --> 00:24:06.116
哦，那不是一回事。杰瑞！
Oh, that's not a thing. Jerry!

429
00:24:06.151 --> 00:24:07.652
我想玩得开心。
I wanna have fun.

430
00:24:08.923 --> 00:24:10.589
我想玩得开心。
I wanna have fun.

431
00:24:13.293 --> 00:24:16.293
让我们有点愚蠢吧。嗯？
Let's be a little stupid. Huh?

432
00:24:16.328 --> 00:24:18.096
我们17岁时结婚了，
We got married when we were 17,

433
00:24:18.131 --> 00:24:19.862
所以我们知道怎么做。
so we know how to do it.

434
00:24:21.298 --> 00:24:22.535
嗯，那是真的。
Well, that's true.

435
00:24:23.631 --> 00:24:26.539
我们需要一些东西。
We need something for us.

436
00:24:28.675 --> 00:24:30.873
我没想到会是彩票，
I didn't think it would be playing the lottery,

437
00:24:30.909 --> 00:24:34.844
但如果银行给我们提供了什么可以谈的，我会抢劫银行。
but I'd rob a bank if it gave us something to talk about.

438
00:24:35.849 --> 00:24:36.981
可以
Okay.

439
00:24:37.016 --> 00:24:40.314
$15,000? 是的。
$15,000? Yep.

440
00:24:43.049 --> 00:24:45.656
如果我们下注15000美元。。。
If we bet the whole $15,000...

441
00:24:45.691 --> 00:24:48.056
哦，我们应该。让我们全赌一把。你觉得呢？
Oh, we should. Let's bet it all. You think?

442
00:24:48.091 --> 00:24:51.228
是的，因为我也这么想。没错。。。
Yeah, 'cause I was thinking the same thing. It's right...

443
00:24:51.263 --> 00:24:53.232
不不不不不。
No. No, no, no, no.

444
00:24:53.268 --> 00:24:55.695
Leon WinFall怎么了？
Leon, what happened to WinFall?

445
00:24:55.731 --> 00:24:57.831
哦，他们。。。他们逐步淘汰了它。
Oh, they... they phased it out.

446
00:24:57.866 --> 00:25:00.337
什么就这样消失了？
What? It's gone, just like that?

447
00:25:00.372 --> 00:25:01.967
你不会玩吧？
You don't play anyway, do you?

448
00:25:02.003 --> 00:25:04.938
不，是的，我想人们会
No. Yeah, well, I guess people will just

449
00:25:04.973 --> 00:25:07.239
现在必须在马萨诸塞州比赛。
have to play the one in Massachusetts now.

450
00:25:09.683 --> 00:25:12.479
数学是可行的。你可以看到这一点。你是个会计。
The math works. You can see that. You're an accountant.

451
00:25:12.514 --> 00:25:14.086
是 啊我是说。。。
Yeah. I mean...

452
00:25:14.121 --> 00:25:15.221
我是说，看起来不错。
I mean, it looks right.

453
00:25:15.256 --> 00:25:16.580
马萨诸塞州也不远。
And Massachusetts isn't that far.

454
00:25:16.616 --> 00:25:20.425
不，如果我们的卡车不抛锚的话，只需要大约10个小时的车程。
No, it's only about a 10-hour drive if our truck doesn't break down.

455
00:25:20.460 --> 00:25:22.355
如果是的话，我们可以搭便车。是 啊
If it does, we'll get a ride. Yeah.

456
00:25:22.391 --> 00:25:23.761
来自谁？
From whom?

457
00:25:23.796 --> 00:25:25.926
卡车司机。是的，他们总是在找人作伴。
Truckers. Yeah, they're always looking for company.

458
00:25:25.961 --> 00:25:28.262
谋杀。如果事情变得奇怪，我们会跳出来的。
To murder. We'll jump out if it gets weird.

459
00:25:28.297 --> 00:25:31.163
他们甚至不知道我们有一个装满现金的行李袋。
And they won't even know that we have a duffle bag full of cash.

460
00:25:31.199 --> 00:25:33.501
是的，我们会一直保持沉默。
Yeah, we'll keep that zipped up.

461
00:25:33.537 --> 00:25:36.040
好吧好吧，什么？
All right. All right, what?

462
00:25:36.075 --> 00:25:37.208
我也加入了。
I'm in, too.

463
00:25:37.243 --> 00:25:39.237
你确定吗？不
You sure? No.

464
00:25:39.273 --> 00:25:42.877
但到底怎么了？给我1000美元。
But what the hell? Put me in for 1,000.

465
00:25:42.912 --> 00:25:44.947
我刚刚有一次巡航，我现在要取消。
I just got a cruise I gotta cancel now.

466
00:26:00.698 --> 00:26:02.964
嘿哦哦我们吃过晚饭了。
Hey. Oh. Oh. Got our dinner.

467
00:26:02.999 --> 00:26:06.331
是 啊我们需要三天的食物。
Yeah. We're going to need three days of food.

468
00:26:07.039 --> 00:26:07.934
哦
Oh.

469
00:26:07.969 --> 00:26:10.071
我给我们找了一个小镇玩。
And I found us a small town to play in.

470
00:26:10.606 --> 00:26:12.741
是的，保持安静。
Yeah, keep things quiet.

471
00:26:12.777 --> 00:26:15.081
就像我在一个街区外停车一样
You know, like how I park a block away

472
00:26:15.116 --> 00:26:16.642
在一次很好的车库拍卖会上。
at a good garage sale.

473
00:26:16.677 --> 00:26:18.079
是 啊哦移动
Yeah? Oh. Move.

474
00:26:21.288 --> 00:26:23.554
你有火腿收音机吗？什么
You got a ham radio? What?

475
00:26:23.590 --> 00:26:25.557
火腿收音机。我们要去一些死区。
Ham radio. We're gonna hit some dead zones.

476
00:26:25.592 --> 00:26:28.687
我想我可以去Ace。。。等一下。
I suppose I can go to Ace... Wait a minute.

477
00:26:29.790 --> 00:26:31.292
我们的电池怎么样？
How are we on batteries?

478
00:26:31.328 --> 00:26:33.628
嗯我
Uh... I...

479
00:26:33.663 --> 00:26:36.063
啊。
Ah.

480
00:26:36.098 --> 00:26:40.033
可以我们再来点吧。以防万一。
Okay. Let's get some more. Just in case.

481
00:26:40.068 --> 00:26:42.166
感觉我们真的在抢劫银行。
Feels like we really are robbing a bank.

482
00:26:42.202 --> 00:26:45.638
不。这会更有趣。你拿去吧。
Nah. It's gonna be more fun. You take that.

483
00:26:45.673 --> 00:26:47.475
这是钥匙。
Here are the keys.

484
00:26:47.510 --> 00:26:49.345
好吧啊。
All right. Aah.

485
00:26:49.380 --> 00:26:51.645
我拿到优惠券了。
I got the coupons.

486
00:26:51.680 --> 00:26:53.050
好吧你抓住它。
All right. You grab that.

487
00:26:53.086 --> 00:26:55.120
哦，现在？哦
Oh, now? Oh.

488
00:26:55.155 --> 00:26:56.452
走吧。哦
Let's go. Oh.

489
00:26:56.487 --> 00:26:58.454
我可以先穿衣服吗？
Can I get dressed first?

490
00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:05.691
嗯。哇哦。
Mmm. Whoo.

491
00:27:05.726 --> 00:27:07.095
你有饼干吗？
You have cookies?

492
00:27:12.566 --> 00:27:14.366
哦。
Ooh.

493
00:27:50.904 --> 00:27:52.237
看起来不太像。
Doesn't look like much.

494
00:27:52.272 --> 00:27:55.341
我们只需要一台售票机，对吗？
Well, all we need is a ticket machine, right?

495
00:28:00.984 --> 00:28:02.982
嘿，孩子，那些是买一送一，
Hey, kid, those are buy one, get one free,

496
00:28:03.017 --> 00:28:04.684
因为它们太过时了。
'cause they're so out of date.

497
00:28:04.719 --> 00:28:06.086
他们来自2013年，
They're from 2013,

498
00:28:06.121 --> 00:28:09.190
但他们仍然会让你的嘴变蓝。
but they'll still turn your mouth blue.

499
00:28:11.059 --> 00:28:12.826
事实上，我会先拿出来的。
Actually, I'm gonna get them first.

500
00:28:12.861 --> 00:28:14.764
我能为您做些什么？
How can I help you?

501
00:28:14.800 --> 00:28:18.166
我们想买8000张秋冬门票。
We'd like to buy 8,000 WinFall tickets.

502
00:28:20.100 --> 00:28:21.466
我会先抓住你的。
I'm gonna get you first.

503
00:28:24.842 --> 00:28:26.372
这还不够。
No way is this enough.

504
00:28:27.646 --> 00:28:29.045
这还不够。
There's no way that was enough.

505
00:28:29.412 --> 00:28:30.682
嗯
Uh...

506
00:28:30.717 --> 00:28:33.181
八千张WinFall门票就像。。。
Eight thousand WinFall tickets is, like...

507
00:28:34.384 --> 00:28:36.288
$29,000.
$29,000.

508
00:28:36.323 --> 00:28:39.051
编号16000$16,000.
No. 16,000. $16,000.

509
00:28:39.087 --> 00:28:41.893
这就是我们带来的钱。
And that is how much we brought.

510
00:28:43.759 --> 00:28:47.130
嗯，这台机器每小时打印1000张票，所以你整天都在这里。
Well, the machine prints 1,000 tickets an hour, so you'll be here all day.

511
00:28:47.165 --> 00:28:49.860
让我根据经验告诉你，整天呆在这里很糟糕。
And let me tell you from experience, being here all day sucks.

512
00:28:50.998 --> 00:28:52.365
因为我整天都在这里。
Because I'm here all day.

513
00:28:54.070 --> 00:28:58.173
嗯，他是对的。这需要八个小时。
Well, he's right. It's gonna take eight hours.

514
00:28:58.974 --> 00:29:00.844
我能做到。我们开始吧。
I can do it. Let's get rolling.

515
00:29:00.880 --> 00:29:04.850
你想要我们？是的，来吧。我有工作要做。
You want us? Yeah, come on. I got work to do.

516
00:29:04.885 --> 00:29:07.484
我很忙。那么，你能告诉我们它是如何工作的吗？
I'm busy. Well, can you show us how it works?

517
00:29:07.519 --> 00:29:08.950
你会明白的。
You'll figure it out.

518
00:29:08.985 --> 00:29:11.315
对不起，汽车旅馆不太好。
Sorry, the motel's not so great.

519
00:29:11.350 --> 00:29:13.653
镐和铲。
The Pick and Shovel.

520
00:29:13.689 --> 00:29:15.122
完美的名字。
Perfect name.

521
00:29:15.157 --> 00:29:17.893
因为这是你挖坟墓所需要的。
Because it's what you need to dig a grave.

522
00:29:17.929 --> 00:29:20.691
哈哈。让我想起了我们的新婚之夜。
Hah. Reminds me of our wedding night.

523
00:29:20.727 --> 00:29:22.230
嗯？
Huh?

524
00:29:22.265 --> 00:29:25.596
我爸爸给了我足够的钱带你去舞会。
My dad gave me enough money to take you to the prom.

525
00:29:25.631 --> 00:29:28.332
但后来我想，“见鬼，舞会在午夜结束，
But then I thought, "Heck, the prom ends at midnight,

526
00:29:28.367 --> 00:29:30.970
“但婚姻是永恒的。
"but a marriage, that lasts forever.

527
00:29:31.005 --> 00:29:32.642
“而且便宜20美元。”
"And it's 20 bucks cheaper."

528
00:29:32.677 --> 00:29:35.172
你在一家戴斯旅馆里度过的。
Which you spent on a Days Inn.

529
00:29:35.208 --> 00:29:38.044
哦，在我们的蜜月上。是 啊
Oh, on our honeymoon. Yeah.

530
00:29:38.080 --> 00:29:41.915
我很高兴我们疯了。
Well, I'm glad we're being crazy.

531
00:29:41.951 --> 00:29:44.048
如果有必要，我会睡在车里。
I'd sleep in the car if I had to.

532
00:29:44.083 --> 00:29:46.122
嗯，你可能不得不这么做。
Well, you may have to.

533
00:29:46.988 --> 00:29:48.693
我想这扇门锁不上。
I don't think this door locks.

534
00:29:48.728 --> 00:29:51.490
哦，开始了，杰瑞。哦，哦，哦，哦，哦。
Oh, it's on, Jerry. Oh, oh, oh, oh.

535
00:29:55.169 --> 00:29:56.231
好吧
All right.

536
00:29:57.635 --> 00:29:59.404
哦，你有。。。
Oh, you have the...

537
00:29:59.439 --> 00:30:02.571
交叉手指，我们最后的幸运数字是21。
 Cross those fingers, our very last lucky number is 21.

538
00:30:02.607 --> 00:30:08.545
各位，这些数字再一次是23、45、01、25、06和21。
Folks, those numbers, one more time, are 23, 45, 01, 25, 06 and 21.

539
00:30:08.580 --> 00:30:11.375
好了，各位，检查一下这些数字。我们祝你好运。
All right, folks, check those numbers. We wish you the best of luck.

540
00:30:11.411 --> 00:30:13.747
希望这是你的一周。可以
Hopefully this was your week. Okay.

541
00:30:18.521 --> 00:30:23.192
嗯，我们有8000张票要检查。
Well, we got 8,000 tickets to check.

542
00:30:23.826 --> 00:30:25.090
让我们开始吧。
Let's get started.

543
00:30:25.125 --> 00:30:27.130
我们可能会看到日出。
We'll probably see sunrise.

544
00:30:50.352 --> 00:30:55.527
最后一个是三位数的赢家。
The last one is a three-number winner.

545
00:30:55.563 --> 00:30:57.424
哦，很好。
Oh, good.

546
00:30:58.231 --> 00:30:59.360
可以
Okay.

547
00:31:01.128 --> 00:31:04.970
所以我们赌16000。嗯哼。
So we bet 16,000. Mmm-hmm.

548
00:31:06.139 --> 00:31:11.103
两位数字优胜者只给我们免费门票，
And the two number winners just gives us free tickets,

549
00:31:11.139 --> 00:31:13.643
所以如果我们把这些算作推力。。。
so if we count those as a push...

550
00:31:13.678 --> 00:31:16.674
这意味着我们。。。
Which means we made...

551
00:31:17.811 --> 00:31:20.282
$21,043.
$21,043.

552
00:31:20.550 --> 00:31:22.083
哦
Oh...

553
00:31:22.118 --> 00:31:24.949
我想我们需要更多的奥利奥。
I think we're gonna need more Oreos.

554
00:31:26.690 --> 00:31:30.927
是的，我们都。。。不，见鬼。还有一小块给你。
Yeah, we're all... No, heck. There's a little piece left there for you.

555
00:31:30.962 --> 00:31:33.661
不你确定你不。。。
No. You sure you don't...

556
00:31:33.697 --> 00:31:35.000
不，谢谢你。
No, thank you.

557
00:31:54.085 --> 00:31:57.884
他们只是说：“恭喜你。”呵呵。
They just said, "Congratulations." Huh.

558
00:31:57.920 --> 00:31:59.352
他们当然知道了。
Of course they did.

559
00:31:59.387 --> 00:32:01.324
买票并不违反规定。
It's not against the rules to buy tickets.

560
00:32:01.360 --> 00:32:04.990
我以为警报会响，他们会开始对我大喊大叫。
I thought an alarm would go off and they'd start yelling at me.

561
00:32:05.025 --> 00:32:07.032
我也是。
So did I.

562
00:32:08.398 --> 00:32:11.333
你真的认为只有我们知道吗？
Do you really think we're the only ones who know?

563
00:32:30.587 --> 00:32:34.923
嘿，为什么我们的厕所隔间上有超声波传感器？
Hey, why are there ultrasonic sensors on our toilet stalls?

564
00:32:34.958 --> 00:32:36.459
浴室空置网格。
Bathroom vacancy grid.

565
00:32:36.494 --> 00:32:39.296
我厌倦了走在那里，看到每个摊位下都有脚。
I got tired of walking in there and seeing feet under every stall.

566
00:32:39.331 --> 00:32:42.362
所以，现在我知道当绿灯亮的时候，厕所是。。。
So, now I know that when the light is green, the toilet is...

567
00:32:42.398 --> 00:32:44.364
嗯，不干净，但没有人坐在上面。
Well, not clean, but nobody is sitting on it.

568
00:32:44.400 --> 00:32:46.304
我们应该做我们的研究项目。
We're supposed to be doing our research projects.

569
00:32:46.339 --> 00:32:47.366
我是。
I am.

570
00:32:47.401 --> 00:32:49.004
浴室灯？不，那太愚蠢了。
Bathroom lights? No. That'd be stupid.

571
00:32:49.039 --> 00:32:50.267
我正在买彩票。
I'm doing one on the lottery.

572
00:32:50.303 --> 00:32:52.874
啊。那就更愚蠢了。
Ah. That's way more stupid.

573
00:32:52.909 --> 00:32:54.244
事实并非如此。我在评估
It's not. I'm evaluating

574
00:32:54.280 --> 00:32:57.742
赢得强力球和百万富翁的确切几率。
the exact odds of winning Powerball versus Mega Millions.

575
00:32:57.778 --> 00:33:00.712
可以是的，这很愚蠢。无论什么我还是会得个B。
Okay. Yeah, it's stupid. Whatever. I'll still get a B.

576
00:33:02.115 --> 00:33:03.418
这些是什么？
What are these?

577
00:33:03.453 --> 00:33:06.187
规模较小的国家运动会。我需要它们进行比较。
The smaller state games. I need them for comparison.

578
00:33:06.222 --> 00:33:08.621
含糖的残疾人摊位开着。
Sweet. The handicapped stall is open.

579
00:33:46.599 --> 00:33:48.166
杰瑞，靠边停车。
Jerry, pull over.

580
00:33:49.168 --> 00:33:51.735
快点，靠边停车。我们离家只有一英里。
Come on, pull over. We're only a mile from home.

581
00:33:51.771 --> 00:33:53.097
不，你拿不住？
No. You can't hold it?

582
00:33:53.133 --> 00:33:54.535
不是那样的。
It's not that.

583
00:33:55.673 --> 00:33:57.208
可以可以
Okay. Okay.

584
00:34:15.962 --> 00:34:17.696
Marge这要花多长时间？
Marge, how long is this gonna take?

585
00:34:17.731 --> 00:34:19.494
因为我真的得走了。
'Cause I actually have to go.

586
00:34:21.300 --> 00:34:24.565
你有没有想过也许这个世界没有从你身边经过？
Did you ever think maybe the world wasn't passing you by?

587
00:34:26.269 --> 00:34:28.371
也许你应该在这里。
Maybe you were meant to be here.

588
00:34:29.808 --> 00:34:31.308
在工厂工作
To work in the factory

589
00:34:31.343 --> 00:34:33.673
像你那样关心这些人，
and to care about all these people the way you do,

590
00:34:33.708 --> 00:34:37.479
因为总有一天你可以帮助他们。
because the day would come when you could help them.

591
00:34:40.180 --> 00:34:42.120
什么意思？
What do you mean?

592
00:34:42.156 --> 00:34:45.784
你说我们赌得越多，胜算就越大。
Well, you said the more we bet, the better the odds.

593
00:35:00.772 --> 00:35:02.306
我确实说过。
I did say that.

594
00:35:08.344 --> 00:35:10.880
你想成立一家公司？
So you wanna start a corporation?

595
00:35:10.915 --> 00:35:12.382
把全镇的人都带进来。
Bring in the whole town.

596
00:35:12.418 --> 00:35:15.182
如果我们出售股票，我们将有更多的资本投资。
If we sell shares, we'll have more capital to invest.

597
00:35:15.217 --> 00:35:17.288
要么出众，要么出局
Go big or go home.

598
00:35:17.323 --> 00:35:19.887
然后我们将与股东分享利润。
Then we'll split the profits with the shareholders.

599
00:35:19.923 --> 00:35:21.354
每个人都骑自行车。
Everybody rides.

600
00:35:21.390 --> 00:35:22.619
你能不能别再那样说话了？
Will you stop talking like that?

601
00:35:22.655 --> 00:35:24.663
很抱歉我真的很喜欢。
Sorry. I'm just really into it.

602

她真的很喜欢。

603
00:35:26.196 --> 00:35:27.632
因为她知道这会奏效的。

604
00:35:27.667 --> 00:35:28.862
豪斯总是赢。

605
00:35:28.897 --> 00:35:29.894
住手。
Stop it.

606
00:35:31.104 --> 00:35:32.801
你真的认为人们会参与进来吗？
You really think people will come in on this?

607
00:35:32.837 --> 00:35:33.998
是的。你做到了。
Yup. You did.

608
00:35:34.033 --> 00:35:36.536
是的，但我是一个沮丧的鳏夫，没有生活的理由。
Yeah, but I'm a depressed widower with nothing to live for.

609
00:35:36.571 --> 00:35:39.244
那你想买更多的股票吗？对
You wanna buy more shares, then? Yes!

610
00:35:40.176 --> 00:35:41.942
就是这样。
And that about does it.

611
00:35:41.977 --> 00:35:43.512
有什么问题吗？
Any questions?

612
00:35:43.547 --> 00:35:47.415
那么，呃，GS投资策略？这是正确的。
So, uh, GS Investment Strategies? That's right.

613
00:35:47.450 --> 00:35:50.116
我们有营业执照，什么都有。
We've got a business license and everything.

614
00:35:50.152 --> 00:35:51.286
名字不算什么。
Not much of a name.

615
00:35:51.321 --> 00:35:52.716
好吧，别担心名字。
Well, don't worry about the name.

616
00:35:52.752 --> 00:35:54.288
你需要在某个地方买彩票。
You need "lottery" in there somewhere.

617
00:35:54.323 --> 00:35:55.789
嗯，名字并不重要。
Well, the name's not important.

618
00:35:55.825 --> 00:35:59.565
如果你想推销这个想法。我上了一堂市场营销课。
It is if you wanna sell the idea. I took a class on marketing.

619
00:35:59.600 --> 00:36:04.970
好吧，这个想法很有说服力。你花500美元买了一只股票，你就盈利了。
Well, the idea sells itself. You buy a share for $500 and you make a profit.

620
00:36:05.005 --> 00:36:07.004
就这么简单。你有徽标吗？
It's that simple. Do you have a logo?

621
00:36:07.039 --> 00:36:08.806
不需要徽标。徽标帮助。
Don't need a logo. Logos help.

622
00:36:08.842 --> 00:36:10.770
我有一头猪在拖拉机上。
I have a pig on a tractor.

623
00:36:12.212 --> 00:36:16.278
是 啊好吧，听着，你们都认识我很多年了。
Yeah. Okay, look, you all have known me for years.

624
00:36:16.314 --> 00:36:19.376
这会起作用的，对每个人都有帮助。
This will work, and it'll help everybody.

625
00:36:19.412 --> 00:36:20.981
如果我们想加入，
What if we want in,

626
00:36:21.016 --> 00:36:24.748
但我们的账单还没付完，还没有足够的钱分一杯羹？
but we're behind on our bills, and don't have enough for a share?

627
00:36:24.784 --> 00:36:26.918
你们接受其他形式的付款吗？
Do you accept other forms of payment?

628
00:36:27.286 --> 00:36:28.419
比如什么？
Like what?

629
00:36:41.840 --> 00:36:42.972
等等，等等，等等。
Wait, wait, wait.

630
00:36:43.007 --> 00:36:44.468
在这里一切正常。
Got it all right here.

631
00:36:44.503 --> 00:36:46.210
哦，我们进去了。
Oh, we're in.

632
00:36:46.245 --> 00:36:48.508
我从来没有做过这样的犯罪行为。
I've never done anything criminal like this.

633
00:36:48.544 --> 00:36:50.580
不，雪莉，这不是犯罪。
No, Shirley, it's not criminal.

634
00:36:50.616 --> 00:36:54.413
我们要为所有赢来的钱交税并报销费用。
We're gonna pay taxes on all the winnings and claim expenses.

635
00:36:54.448 --> 00:36:56.648
杰瑞把一切都解决了。
Jerry's got it all worked out.

636
00:36:56.684 --> 00:36:59.819
你妈妈和我要做生意了。
Your mother and I are going into business.

637
00:36:59.855 --> 00:37:02.587
你是在卖她的太妃糖还是什么？
Are you selling her toffee or something?

638
00:37:02.623 --> 00:37:05.589
不，我们要买彩票。
No. We're gonna play the lottery.

639
00:37:05.624 --> 00:37:08.563
每股500英镑。可以
It's 500 a share. Okay.

640
00:37:08.598 --> 00:37:11.135
哦，是吗？可以你不想知道细节？
Oh, yeah? Okay? You don't wanna know details?

641
00:37:11.171 --> 00:37:13.370
不，不，不，我很好。听起来好棒。
No, no, no, I'm good. It sounds great.

642
00:37:13.406 --> 00:37:15.204
你可以在前三部剧中看到爸爸，爸爸。
You can see in the first three plays Dad, Dad.

643
00:37:15.240 --> 00:37:16.500
我们增加了利润。
that we've increased our profit.

644
00:37:16.535 --> 00:37:18.342
这不适合我。
It's just not for me.

645
00:37:18.377 --> 00:37:21.207
我只是不明白这一点。这只是数学。
I just don't understand this. It's just math.

646
00:37:21.243 --> 00:37:23.108
这永远只是数学。
It's always just math.

647
00:37:23.143 --> 00:37:25.479
就像在硬币中分类，寻找水牛镍币，
It's like sorting through coins, looking for buffalo nickels,

648
00:37:25.514 --> 00:37:27.383
因为你已经计算过了，
because you had calculated there was,

649
00:37:27.419 --> 00:37:29.754
什么，每七卷就有一卷？

是 啊我们赚了600美元。
Yeah. We made $600.

651

一个月来，我们每个周末都会整理硬币。我当时12岁。
We sorted through coins every weekend for a month. I was 12.

652
00:37:36.388 --> 00:37:37.694
这很有趣。
It was fun.

653
00:37:39.127 --> 00:37:42.631
扔足球什么的就好了。
It would have been nice to just throw the football or something.

654
00:37:45.133 --> 00:37:46.470
听着，我。。。
Look, I'm...

655
00:37:48.237 --> 00:37:50.073
嘿Doug？
Hey, Doug?

Hey, uh, if we're gonna do this again,

00:38:44.860 --> 00:38:47.228
我需要向你收取使用微波炉的费用。
I'm gonna need to charge you for using the microwave.

672
00:38:48.528 --> 00:38:51.634
我们下注4万。

673
00:38:52.301 --> 00:38:53.567
你们这些毒贩？

674
00:38:53.603 --> 00:38:57.140
不，我们是职业彩票玩家。
No. We're professional lottery players.

675
00:38:57.175 --> 00:38:58.709
我不认为那是一件事。

676

现在是。

Listen, as much as I'd like to see if you can stand behind that thing

678
00:39:03.877 --> 00:39:05.915
这么长时间都没有摔断臀部，
for that long without breaking a hip,

679
00:39:05.950 --> 00:39:08.546
你不可能在关门前买到那么多票。
there's no way you can buy that many tickets before closing time.

680
00:39:08.581 --> 00:39:10.382
你能晚点开门吗？
Can you stay open later?

681
00:39:10.418 --> 00:39:11.786
哦，恐怕不行。

685
00:39:21.193 --> 00:39:24.929
现在，不可否认，我们在外面的停车场，
Now, admittedly we do it out there, in the parking lot,

686
00:39:24.965 --> 00:39:28.136
但是，呃，我这里不能有顾客。
but, uh, I just can't have customers in here.

687
00:39:28.171 --> 00:39:29.705
这是一种负担。
It's a liability.

688
00:39:31.337 --> 00:39:33.308
好
Well...

689
00:39:33.343 --> 00:39:35.414
如果我们不是客户呢？
What if we weren't customers?

690
00:39:42.916 --> 00:39:44.852
我不知道你在说什么。
I have no idea what you're talking about.

691
00:39:45.717 --> 00:39:48.990
如果我们是搭档呢？
What if we were partners?

692
00:39:49.025 --> 00:39:55.830
比尔，我想向你介绍一下GS投资策略。
Bill, I'd like to introduce you to GS Investment Strategies.

693
00:39:58.103 --> 00:39:59.768
我加入了。我能进来吗？
I'm in. Can I be in?

694
00:40:03.041 --> 00:40:06.839
所以我是股东，如果你们愿意，我完全可以让你们加入。
So I'm a shareholder, and I could totally get you guys in if you want.

695
00:40:06.874 --> 00:40:10.278
所以，这是一个冬天，所以当数字。。。
So, it's a WinFall, so when the numbers...

696
00:40:10.314 --> 00:40:14.313
好吧，你是个投资者。。。好吧，假设你有几百美元。
Okay, you're an investor... Okay, let's say you've got several hundred dollars.

697
00:40:14.348 --> 00:40:19.656
还有这些彩票号码。如果他们不打，你就赢了。
Then there is these lottery numbers. If they don't hit, you win.

698
00:40:20.357 --> 00:40:23.121
你在吗？你有钱吗？
You in? You got any money?

699
00:40:24.063 --> 00:40:26.058
我相信我们已经完成了。
I believe we are done.

700
00:40:26.860 --> 00:40:28.758
嘿，我还有两个股东。
Hey, I got two more shareholders.

701
00:40:28.794 --> 00:40:31.932
其中一个很快就要去抢劫他父母的房子，但他肯定在里面。
One of them's got to rob his parents' house real quick, but he's definitely in.

702
00:40:33.139 --> 00:40:35.567
还有500张票。是的。
That's 500 more tickets. Yup.

703
00:40:35.602 --> 00:40:36.867
好吧
All right.

704
00:40:36.903 --> 00:40:38.639
你想很快打一拳吗？
You want a bong hit real quick?

705
00:40:38.675 --> 00:40:41.575
我不知道那是什么。玛姬？
I don't know what that is. Marge?

706
00:40:41.610 --> 00:40:44.714
不，谢谢，比尔。好吧噢
No thanks, Bill. All right. Ow!

707
00:40:49.422 --> 00:40:51.589
我们的下一个号码是46。。。
Our next number is 46...

708
00:40:52.320 --> 00:40:54.086
24号。。。
Number 24...

709
00:40:54.121 --> 00:40:57.995
今天最后一个数字是23号。
And our very last number for today is number 23.

710
00:40:58.030 --> 00:41:02.165
所以，再一次，这些数字是05，21，39，46，24，23。。。
So, one more time, those numbers are 05, 21, 39, 46, 24, 23...

711
00:41:02.200 --> 00:41:04.665
好了，开始吧。
Okay, here we go.

712
00:41:04.701 --> 00:41:07.605
再也没有香烟被烧焦了，嗯？是 啊
No more cigarette burns, huh? Yeah.

713
00:41:12.044 --> 00:41:13.644
好
Well...

714
00:41:13.680 --> 00:41:18.649
我想我们可以点一些美味的汽车旅馆咖啡
I guess we fire up some of that delicious motel coffee

715
00:41:19.414 --> 00:41:21.449
然后开始。
and get started.

716
00:41:21.484 --> 00:41:23.082
或者可以等到早上。
Or it could wait till morning.

717
00:41:23.889 --> 00:41:25.018
明天
Tomorrow?

718
00:41:40.169 --> 00:41:41.573
哦
Oh.

719
00:41:43.469 --> 00:41:44.972
隐马尔可夫模型。
Hmm.

720
00:41:52.348 --> 00:41:53.913
彩票？
The lottery?

721
00:41:53.949 --> 00:41:55.582
彩票中奖者获得大量点击。
Lottery winners get a lot of clicks.

722
00:41:55.617 --> 00:41:57.685
我不点击。我做新闻。
I don't do clicks. I do news.

723
00:41:57.720 --> 00:42:00.724
你没有看到所有这些空隔间吗？
Do you not see all these empty cubicles?

724
00:42:01.623 --> 00:42:03.793
随便找点什么。
Just poke around for something.

725
00:42:04.461 --> 00:42:06.197
给我找个标题
Find me a headline that I can

726
00:42:06.232 --> 00:42:08.226
加入聚光灯部分。
throw in the Spotlight section.

727
00:42:15.637 --> 00:42:18.370
隐马尔可夫模型。
Hmm.

728
00:42:18.405 --> 00:42:23.177
哦，这个床垫的好处是，我们都滚到中间去了。
Oh, nice thing about this mattress is, we both roll to the center.

729
00:42:25.683 --> 00:42:28.283
我想如果我努力的话，我是逃不出去的。
I don't think I can get out if I tried.

730
00:42:28.319 --> 00:42:30.021
嗯，我们有时间。
Well, we have time.

731
00:42:31.685 --> 00:42:34.022
什么搞什么鬼？
What? What the heck?

732
00:42:34.057 --> 00:42:36.287
嘿，嘿，好吧，好吧。
Hey, hey, all right, all right.

733
00:42:37.860 --> 00:42:40.230
去错房间了。去错房间了。
Got the wrong room. Got the wrong room.

734
00:42:40.265 --> 00:42:42.064
它进来了！怎么了？
It came in! What did?

735
00:42:42.099 --> 00:42:45.566
彩票发送商店出售的所有中奖金额的记录。
The lottery sends a tally of all the winnings sold by the store.

736
00:42:45.601 --> 00:42:49.107
WinFall的门票赢得了82000美元。
WinFall tickets won $82,000.

737
00:42:50.337 --> 00:42:53.871
你在店里卖了多少张秋冬门票？
And how many WinFall tickets did you sell at your store?

738
00:42:53.907 --> 00:42:56.511
就你的，再加上六个。对
Just yours, plus six more. Yes!

739
00:42:56.546 --> 00:42:58.312
对我来说。但他们没有赢。
To me. But those didn't win.

740
00:42:59.451 --> 00:43:00.712
我们加倍了。我们加倍了。
We doubled it. We doubled it.

741
00:43:00.747 --> 00:43:02.613
我们加倍了！
We doubled it!

742
00:43:02.649 --> 00:43:03.680
我们加倍了！
We doubled it!

743
00:43:04.817 --> 00:43:06.251
我们加倍了！
We doubled it!

744
00:43:48.628 --> 00:43:51.131
哇哦！
Whoo!

745
00:44:00.673 --> 00:44:02.409
我是史蒂夫。
It's Steve.

746
00:44:02.444 --> 00:44:03.542
嘿，史蒂夫。
Hey, Steve.

747
00:44:03.577 --> 00:44:05.014
嘿Jerry。
Hey, Jerry.

748
00:44:05.050 --> 00:44:08.615
我只是想看看我们做得怎么样。嗯，你知道，很好奇。
I was just checking to see how we did. Um, you know, curious.

749
00:44:08.651 --> 00:44:12.149
我将发送一份正式的股东报告。
 I will be sending out an official shareholder report.

750
00:44:12.185 --> 00:44:14.987
是的，是的，对，对，但你知道。。。
Yeah, yeah, right, right, but you know...

751
00:44:15.022 --> 00:44:17.061
他想知道。你怎么认为？
He wants to know. What do you think?

752
00:44:20.331 --> 00:44:23.265
嗯，我们加倍了。
Well, we doubled it.

753
00:44:23.301 --> 00:44:24.334
我们加倍了！
We doubled it!

754
00:44:35.113 --> 00:44:36.308
嘘。
Shh.

755
00:45:00.465 --> 00:45:02.338
这不可能是真的。我也不相信，
This can't be real. I didn't believe it either,

756
00:45:02.373 --> 00:45:05.669
但我在画图时一直在进行模拟，这是对的。
but I've been running simulations during the drawings, and it's right.

757
00:45:05.705 --> 00:45:08.342
如果你至少下注1万，赔率就会向买家倾斜。
If you bet at least 10 grand, the odds tilt towards the buyer.

758
00:45:08.377 --> 00:45:10.575
你能从你爸爸那里弄到钱吗？我不是在问他什么。
Can you get money from your dad? I'm not asking him for shit.

759
00:45:10.610 --> 00:45:13.184
为什么不呢？他的名字在一栋大楼上。我想他买得起。
Why not? His name is on a building. I think he can afford it.

760
00:45:13.220 --> 00:45:14.748
因为这是我的。
Because this is mine.

761
00:45:14.783 --> 00:45:16.112
你有一万块吗？不
Do you have 10 grand? No.

762
00:45:18.125 --> 00:45:19.588
我有一个宿舍。
I have a dorm.

763
00:45:19.624 --> 00:45:21.055
好的，那是一片披萨
Okay, that is one slice of pizza

764
00:45:21.090 --> 00:45:22.554
每人。一片。非常感谢。
per person. One slice. Thank you.

765
00:45:22.589 --> 00:45:25.162
嘿，只有在你向基金捐款的情况下才能分一杯羹。
Hey, only take a piece if you contributed to the fund.

766
00:45:25.198 --> 00:45:30.032
你在哈佛学到的第一件事是，你在这里是为了你的未来。
The first thing you learn at Harvard is that you're here for your future.

767
00:45:30.399 --> 00:45:31.929
正当
Right?

768
00:45:31.965 --> 00:45:33.398
你学到的第二件事。。。
Second thing you learn...

769
00:45:33.966 --> 00:45:35.469
都是胡说八道。
Is that's all bullshit.

770
00:45:36.607 --> 00:45:38.743
没有未来。
There is no future.

771
00:45:38.778 --> 00:45:42.809
现在有一件事正等着你去拿。
There is just now waiting for you to take it.

772
00:45:42.844 --> 00:45:46.783
我在彩票中发现了一个漏洞。
I found a flaw in the lottery.

773
00:45:46.818 --> 00:45:49.612
可以一种每次都能击败比赛的方法
Okay? A way to beat the game every time

774
00:45:49.648 --> 00:45:52.656
因为彩票上没人知道我做了什么。
because nobody at the lottery figured out what I did.

775
00:45:52.692 --> 00:45:55.621
但只有当你能下大赌注的时候，它才会起作用。
But it only works if you can bet big.

776
00:45:55.656 --> 00:46:01.264
所以，告诉你的父母你有新的实验室费用，或者需要书，
So, tell your parents that you have new lab fees, or need books,

777
00:46:01.300 --> 00:46:03.265
或者得了性病。
or got an STD.

778
00:46:04.765 --> 00:46:10.603
无论如何，因为如果我们成功了，那么我们就是传奇！
Whatever it takes, because if we pull this off, then we are legends!

779
00:46:13.739 --> 00:46:18.108
还有，我需要你们填写大约300张彩票，
Also, I'm gonna need you all to fill out about 300 lottery slips,

780
00:46:18.143 --> 00:46:19.846
所以我们不赌重复。
so we don't bet duplicates.

781
00:46:19.881 --> 00:46:21.479
干得好。那是给你的。
Here you go. That's for you.

782
00:46:22.485 --> 00:46:23.514
非常感谢。
Thank you.

783
00:46:26.756 --> 00:46:28.424
你什么都没填？
You're not filling any out?

784
00:46:28.459 --> 00:46:30.389
不，我负责。
No. I'm in charge.

785
00:46:33.328 --> 00:46:35.999
好的，跟我谈谈。所以你想翻新它？
Okay, talk to me. So you wanna renovate it?

786
00:46:36.034 --> 00:46:38.768
是的。所有股东都在插手。
Yup. All the shareholders are chipping in.

787
00:46:38.804 --> 00:46:40.564
我们要恢复爵士音乐节。
We're bringing back the jazz festival.

788
00:46:40.599 --> 00:46:43.802
最好的音乐是你边走边编的音乐。
The best music is the music you make up as you go along.

789
00:46:43.838 --> 00:46:47.104
啊，我只是很难过，当普林斯在的时候，我们不可能拥有它。
Ah, I'm just sad we couldn't have had it when Prince was around.

790
00:46:47.139 --> 00:46:48.708
他不会来的，霍华德。
He wouldn't have come, Howard.

791
00:46:48.743 --> 00:46:50.179
我们永远不会知道。
We'll never know.

792
00:46:50.215 --> 00:46:52.550
你们确定这就是你们想用钱做的吗？
You guys are sure this is what you wanna do with your money?

793
00:46:52.586 --> 00:46:53.949
你不想把它投资到什么地方？
You don't wanna invest it somewhere?

794
00:46:53.984 --> 00:46:56.283
我们正在某处投资。
We are investing it somewhere.

795
00:46:59.357 --> 00:47:00.353
好吧
All right.

796
00:47:01.154 --> 00:47:02.958
我来帮你一把。好吧
I'll give you a hand. All right.

797
00:47:02.993 --> 00:47:05.523
道格，把它放在上面。是的。好吧
Doug, put it on top there. Yup. All right.

798
00:47:06.828 --> 00:47:08.999
非常感谢。
Thank you.

799
00:47:09.564 --> 00:47:10.594
哇！
Wow.

800
00:47:11.702 --> 00:47:12.937
你为什么要保留这些？
Why do you keep all these?

801
00:47:13.205 --> 00:47:14.466
国税局。
The IRS.

802
00:47:15.341 --> 00:47:16.635
当我们接受审计时，
When we get audited,

803
00:47:16.670 --> 00:47:19.675
我们需要一份我们买的所有失票的书面记录。
we'll need a paper trail of all the losing tickets we bought.

804
00:47:19.710 --> 00:47:21.409
你觉得你会被审计吗？
Think you're gonna get audited?

805
00:47:21.445 --> 00:47:22.639
哦，是的。
Oh, yeah.

806
00:47:23.381 --> 00:47:24.709
上帝啊
Jesus.

807
00:47:24.745 --> 00:47:28.916
你知道，你的团队雇我来修理圆形剧场。六个月的工作。
You know, your group hired me to fix the amphitheater. Six-month job.

808
00:47:28.952 --> 00:47:32.082
哦那怎么样？
Oh. How about that?

809
00:47:32.117 --> 00:47:34.188
是的，怎么样？
Yeah, how about that?

810
00:47:34.224 --> 00:47:38.094
嗯，你可以考虑插手一下。
Well, you may wanna consider chipping in on that.

811
00:47:38.395 --> 00:47:39.892
什么
What?

812
00:47:39.927 --> 00:47:43.099
嗯，你有份。
Well, you have a share.

813
00:47:44.536 --> 00:47:46.135
你做到了，从一开始。
You did, from the start.

814
00:47:48.340 --> 00:47:49.435
爸爸
Dad...

815
00:47:51.676 --> 00:47:53.107
你不必那么做。
You didn't have to do that.

816
00:47:53.142 --> 00:47:55.408
哦，没有你我不想数镍币。
Oh, I didn't wanna count nickels without you.

817
00:48:00.584 --> 00:48:04.922
我告诉你，多蒂在这家书店做得很好。
I'm telling you, Dottie has done such a great job with this bookstore.

818
00:48:04.957 --> 00:48:07.420
是 啊你知道，莱昂正在装修酒店。
Yeah. You know, Leon is renovating the hotel.

819
00:48:07.455 --> 00:48:10.061
霍华德给了他一笔交易，但他的佣金是
Howard got him a deal on it, but his commission is that

820
00:48:10.096 --> 00:48:12.958
他和雪莉可以随时使用热水浴缸。
he and Shirley get to use the hot tub whenever they want.

821
00:48:12.993 --> 00:48:14.860
里昂会后悔的。
Leon will regret that.

822
00:48:14.895 --> 00:48:16.264
你不是在开玩笑吧。
You are not kidding.

823
00:48:16.299 --> 00:48:17.894
-大家好，大家好哦，嘿！
- Hello, hello, everybody. - Oh, hey!

824
00:48:21.466 --> 00:48:23.737
好吧好吧，继续。。。
All right. Well, go ahead...

825
00:48:23.773 --> 00:48:25.907
继续，坐下。
Go on, sit on down.

826
00:48:25.943 --> 00:48:29.741
嗯嗯
Uh... Uh...

827
00:48:29.776 --> 00:48:31.281
好
Well...

828
00:48:31.316 --> 00:48:35.618
听着，首先，我可以说我们做得非常好。
Look, first off, I can say that we're doing pretty darn well.

829
00:48:35.654 --> 00:48:37.246
对
Yes.

830
00:48:37.282 --> 00:48:41.558
是 啊但你可能已经知道，通过阅读你的股东报告。。。
Yeah. But you probably already know that by reading your shareholder report...

831
00:48:41.593 --> 00:48:43.186
我打不开我的。
I can't get mine to open.

832
00:48:43.221 --> 00:48:44.660
哦，你有消息吗？
Oh, do you have Word?

833
00:48:44.695 --> 00:48:46.497
我想我有窗户。
I have Windows, I think.

834
00:48:46.533 --> 00:48:48.464
我给你印一张，雪莉。
I'll print you one, Shirley.

835
00:48:48.500 --> 00:48:49.530
哦，谢谢你。
Oh, thank you.

836
00:48:49.565 --> 00:48:51.035
Anyhoo。。。
Anyhoo...

837
00:48:52.066 --> 00:48:54.171
正如你可能想象的那样，
As you might have imagined it,

838
00:48:54.206 --> 00:48:57.901
我们将用我们的大部分资金来下注。
we're gonna use the majority of our capital for betting.

839
00:48:57.937 --> 00:48:59.107
是 啊
Yeah.

840
00:48:59.143 --> 00:49:05.142
但你可以获得红利。
But there are dividends that you can access.

841
00:49:05.178 --> 00:49:10.321
正当所以，我知道很多人都想看到爵士音乐节回来。
Right. So, I know a lot of people would like to see the jazz festival come back.

842
00:49:11.753 --> 00:49:16.126
而且，老弗兰克肯定会用一辆他不会掉下来的邮车。
And, Old Frank can sure use a mail truck he doesn't fall out of.

843
00:49:17.831 --> 00:49:22.900
嗯，那么，现在谈谈利润率。我们
Uh, so, now on to the profit ratios. We...

844
00:49:22.935 --> 00:49:25.565
是的Raj？这里没有食物吗？
Yes, Raj? Is there not food at this thing?

845
00:49:25.600 --> 00:49:29.304
不，不，这是股东大会。这不是派对。
No. No. This is a shareholder meeting. It's not a party.

846
00:49:29.339 --> 00:49:32.773
那为什么我们都吃的时候你在00点吃？
Then why did you have it at 00, when we all eat?

847
00:49:34.146 --> 00:49:37.608
欢迎大家都去餐厅，但是。。。
Well, you're welcome to all go to the diner, but...

848
00:49:37.643 --> 00:49:40.744
不，那你就不会知道数字了。
No, then you're not gonna learn about the numbers.

849
00:49:42.282 --> 00:49:44.355
那么，下一个剧本是什么？
So, what's the next play?

850
00:49:44.391 --> 00:49:46.250
312000张门票。
312,000 tickets.

851
00:49:46.285 --> 00:49:48.552
那是60万美元。是 啊
That's $600,000. Yeah.

852
00:49:48.587 --> 00:49:52.157
我们一场赌50万？
We're betting half a million in one play?

853
00:49:52.193 --> 00:49:53.892
哦，钱是最容易的部分。
Oh, the money is the easy part.

854
00:49:53.928 --> 00:49:55.293
它是？是 啊
Is it? Yeah.

855
00:49:55.329 --> 00:49:57.735
要赌四天，
It'll take four days of betting,

856
00:49:57.770 --> 00:50:00.103
两台机器，每天12小时。
two machines, 12 hours a day.

857
00:50:00.138 --> 00:50:02.405
那你为什么不按正常金额下注呢？
Then why don't you just bet the normal amount?

858
00:50:02.440 --> 00:50:03.573
数学
Math.

859
00:50:03.608 --> 00:50:04.702
这是牛顿定律。
It's Newton's law.

860
00:50:04.737 --> 00:50:08.073
如果你顶住什么东西，它就会往后推。
If you push against something, it's gonna push back.

861
00:50:08.109 --> 00:50:09.775
我们发现了一个缺陷。
And we discovered a flaw.

862
00:50:09.810 --> 00:50:14.481
但是通过使用它，我们引入了一个变量来改变它。
But by using it, we've introduced a variable that changes it.

863
00:50:14.516 --> 00:50:17.518
我们不知道这场比赛会持续多久。
And we don't know how long this game is gonna last.

864
00:50:17.553 --> 00:50:20.953
然后，我们需要尽可能多地赚钱，尽管我们可以。
Then we need to make as much money as we can, while we can.

865
00:50:20.988 --> 00:50:25.428
让节日继续下去，在它倒退之前完成重建。
Get the festival going, and finish rebuilding before it pushes back.

866
00:50:25.463 --> 00:50:26.425
嗯哼。
Mmm-hmm.

867
00:50:26.461 --> 00:50:28.065
我从彩票订购了第二台机器，
I ordered a second machine from the lottery,

868
00:50:28.101 --> 00:50:29.695
但他们说每个地方只允许一个，
but they said you're only allowed one per location,

869
00:50:29.730 --> 00:50:32.064
所以我想，“如果我再开一家店呢？”
so I was like, "Well, what if I have a second store?"

870
00:50:32.099 --> 00:50:35.170
他们会问，“地址是什么？”我想，“哦，这是我的错。”
They're like, "What's the address?" I was like, "Uh-oh. There's my mistake."

871
00:50:35.206 --> 00:50:37.473
这就是我的朋友Darryl进来的地方。
And that's where my buddy, Darryl, comes in.

872
00:50:37.509 --> 00:50:40.408
我们会多给他一份，但给你。
And, uh, we're gonna give him an extra share, but here you are.

873
00:50:40.443 --> 00:50:44.313
你可以一天24小时打印，外加无限量的馅饼。
You can print out 24 hours a day, plus unlimited pie.

874
00:50:48.147 --> 00:50:49.384
看看这个。
Look at this.

875
00:50:50.016 --> 00:50:51.185
这是什么？
What's this?

876
00:50:51.220 --> 00:50:52.885
来自AG办公室的消息来源。
From my source at the AG's office.

877
00:50:52.920 --> 00:50:56.219
现在，彩票必须披露索赔超过5万的玩家，
Now, the lottery has to disclose players who claim more than 50 grand,

878
00:50:56.254 --> 00:50:57.555
一年五次。
five times a year.

879
00:50:57.591 --> 00:50:59.892
你知道，有时候胜利者是领先者，
Sometimes the winners are fronts, you know,

880
00:50:59.928 --> 00:51:03.398
为欠孩子抚养费或有搜查令的人兑现门票，
cashing tickets for people who owe child support, or have a warrant,

881
00:51:03.433 --> 00:51:07.004
但看看这家伙。每三周赢得一次大奖。
but look at this guy. Wins big every three weeks.

882
00:51:07.039 --> 00:51:09.672
住在密歇根州。退休的工厂工人。
Lives in Michigan. A retired factory worker.

883
00:51:09.708 --> 00:51:10.939
没有犯罪记录。
No criminal record.

884
00:51:10.974 --> 00:51:12.840
他赢了这么多？是 啊
He's won this much? Yeah.

885
00:51:12.875 --> 00:51:17.113
谁每月开10个小时的车在不同的州玩彩票？
Who drives 10 hours every month to play the lottery in a different state?

886
00:51:17.149 --> 00:51:19.183
是的，那没有任何意义。正当
Yeah, that doesn't make any sense. Right.

887
00:51:39.097 --> 00:51:40.567
失败者！
Loser!

888
00:51:48.110 --> 00:51:50.008
那个女人是不是刚刚抢劫了你？
Did that woman just rob you?

889
00:51:50.044 --> 00:51:51.248
那是我妻子。
That's my wife.

890
00:51:52.880 --> 00:51:53.877
哇！
Wow.

891
00:51:54.954 --> 00:51:56.951
嗯，她看起来确实很有精神。
Well, she certainly seems spirited.

892
00:51:56.986 --> 00:51:58.651
是的，她是个泼妇。
Yeah, she's a spitfire.

893
00:51:58.686 --> 00:52:01.488
不，她只是因为我提出离婚而生气，
No, she's just pissed off 'cause I filed for divorce,

894
00:52:01.524 --> 00:52:03.525
她从没想过我能负担得起。
and she didn't ever think I'd be able to afford it.

895
00:52:03.561 --> 00:52:05.061
呵呵。
Huh.

896
00:52:05.096 --> 00:52:07.727
看起来钱花得很好。是 啊
Looks like money well spent. Yeah.

897
00:52:07.762 --> 00:52:11.763
自从Steely Dan停止巡演后就失去了魔力。
Kind of lost the magic ever since Steely Dan stopped touring.

898
00:52:14.540 --> 00:52:16.236
你知道的。。。
You know...

899
00:52:16.272 --> 00:52:17.802
我需要找一个像你这样的人。
I need to find someone like you.

900
00:52:19.244 --> 00:52:22.279
只有年轻人。是的，一开始很好。
Only younger. Yeah, that started off great.

901
00:52:22.314 --> 00:52:26.817
不，我的意思是，你知道，只是一个仍然有生育能力的人。
No, I mean, you know, just someone that's still fertile.

902
00:52:26.852 --> 00:52:28.983
他们的子宫可以生孩子。
And their womb can have babies.

903
00:52:29.018 --> 00:52:30.251
你不擅长这个。
You're not good at this.

904
00:52:30.286 --> 00:52:32.256
哦，我真的不是。你能帮助我吗？
Oh, I'm really not. Can you help me?

905
00:52:33.089 --> 00:52:35.720
我妈妈常说，
Well, my mother used to say,

906
00:52:35.755 --> 00:52:37.958
“吻几只青蛙，然后当你找到你的王子，
"Kiss a few frogs, then when you find your prince,

907
00:52:37.993 --> 00:52:40.924
“你会发现青蛙更好，因为它们让你发笑。”
"you'll realize that the frogs are better, 'cause they make you laugh."

908
00:52:43.495 --> 00:52:45.802
嘲笑你算数吗？
Does laughing at you count?

909
00:52:45.838 --> 00:52:47.968
比尔，你需要一只新青蛙。
Bill, you need a new frog.

910
00:52:48.003 --> 00:52:49.504
我需要一只新青蛙。
I need a new frog.

911
00:52:49.871 --> 00:52:52.807
$50,000.
$50,000.

912
00:52:54.814 --> 00:52:57.113
欢迎来到现在，婊子们。
Welcome to the now, bitches.

913
00:52:57.148 --> 00:52:59.112
我们要赚一大笔钱，
We are going to make a shitload of money,

914
00:52:59.148 --> 00:53:00.818
但这需要时间，
but it's going to take time,

915
00:53:00.853 --> 00:53:03.186
还有汗水和激情，好吗？
and sweat, and passion, okay?

916
00:53:03.221 --> 00:53:06.255
所以，每个人都填写了两叠单据。
So, everybody fill out two stacks of slips.

917
00:53:06.291 --> 00:53:09.219
我们需要在未来三周内投入25000英镑。
We need to get 25,000 in in the next three weeks.

918
00:53:16.900 --> 00:53:18.428
出什么事了？
Something wrong?

919
00:53:18.463 --> 00:53:19.831
还有另一组。
There's another group.

920
00:53:20.099 --> 00:53:21.169
什么
What?

921
00:53:21.205 --> 00:53:22.737
支出应该更大。
The payout should have been bigger.

922
00:53:22.773 --> 00:53:25.372
唯一有意义的是另一组人在锅里吃东西，
The only thing that makes sense is another group eating into the pot,

923
00:53:25.407 --> 00:53:27.345
所以我检查了每家商店的销售额。
so I checked sales at every store.

924
00:53:27.380 --> 00:53:30.578
那是公共信息？不，我黑了州彩票。
That's public information? No, I hacked the state lottery.

925
00:53:30.945 --> 00:53:31.942
美好的
Nice.

926
00:53:32.950 --> 00:53:33.976
等待那是我的笔记本电脑。
Wait. That's my laptop.

927
00:53:34.012 --> 00:53:35.952
是 啊你应该在这之后销毁你的硬盘。
Yeah. You should destroy your hard drive after this.

928
00:53:35.987 --> 00:53:38.786
伙计。无论什么它成功了。
Dude. Whatever. It worked.

929
00:53:38.821 --> 00:53:41.518
看看桑德兰的赢家，只有两个地方。
Look at the winnings in Sunderland, from only two locations.

930
00:53:41.553 --> 00:53:45.725
两个位置。他们必须买一周的票才能得到这样的数字。
Two locations. They'd have to buy tickets for a week to get those kind of numbers.

931
00:53:47.833 --> 00:53:49.399
他们现在就在那里。
They're there right now.

932
00:54:08.118 --> 00:54:11.949
嘿我今晚很早就完成了。
Hey. I finished early tonight.

933
00:54:12.351 --> 00:54:13.921
你急什么？
What's the rush?

934
00:54:13.957 --> 00:54:16.459
哦
Oh...

935
00:54:17.859 --> 00:54:20.893
你以为我不会忘记我们的结婚纪念日，是吗？
You didn't think I'd forget our anniversary, did you?

936
00:54:20.928 --> 00:54:26.296
哦，你刚从冰箱里拿出来。嗯，是的。
Oh, you just got that out of the cooler. Well, yeah.

937
00:54:26.332 --> 00:54:30.035
但我今天早上把它藏在了Yoo-hoo后面，这样就没人会得到它了。
But I hid it behind the Yoo-hoo this morning so that nobody would get it.

938
00:54:35.310 --> 00:54:36.644
哇哦！
Whoo!

939
00:54:37.717 --> 00:54:38.676
哇！
Wow.

940
00:54:38.711 --> 00:54:40.780
你知道这样做很好。
You know it's good when it does that.

941
00:54:42.648 --> 00:54:44.784
美丽的塑料瓷器。
Beautiful plastic china.

942
00:54:46.087 --> 00:54:47.457
干得好。
Here you go.

943
00:54:48.993 --> 00:54:51.362
还有46年。
Here's to 46 more years.

944
00:54:52.961 --> 00:54:54.431
干杯
Cheers.

945
00:54:56.536 --> 00:54:57.632
哦。
Ooh.

946
00:55:03.473 --> 00:55:06.674
我想我还欠你一个舞会之夜。
I think I still owe you a prom night.

947
00:55:23.028 --> 00:55:25.660
这在我16岁的时候更容易。
This was easier when I was 16.

948
00:55:27.232 --> 00:55:29.893
你现在更漂亮了。
You're even more beautiful now.

949
00:55:29.928 --> 00:55:32.836
那是过时的香槟酒谈话。
That's the out-of-date champagne talking.

950
00:55:34.504 --> 00:55:36.301
是的，他真的不应该卖这个。
Yeah, he really shouldn't be selling that.

951
00:55:39.106 --> 00:55:40.675
哦嗯。
Oh. Mmm.

952
00:55:41.574 --> 00:55:43.942
没有老师把我们分开。
No teacher to pull us apart.

953
00:55:54.554 --> 00:55:56.389
你们是另一组？
You guys are the other group?

954
00:55:56.424 --> 00:56:01.025
哦，老兄。我们以为会是犯罪集团之类的。呸。
Oh, man. We thought it was gonna be, like, a crime syndicate or something. Phew.

955
00:56:03.401 --> 00:56:05.228
我不知道你在说什么。
I don't know what you're talking about.

956
00:56:05.264 --> 00:56:08.898
对不起，我们太粗鲁了。我是泰勒，这是埃里克。
Sorry, we are being super rude. I'm Tyler, this is Eric.

957
00:56:08.933 --> 00:56:10.569
我们在哈佛经营一家赌博俱乐部。
We run a betting club at Harvard.

958
00:56:10.604 --> 00:56:12.375
我们被称为随机行业，
We're called Random Industries,

959
00:56:12.410 --> 00:56:14.971
这也是我滑板品牌的名字。
which is also the name of my skateboard brand.

960
00:56:15.006 --> 00:56:17.675
嗯，我想会有其他人。
Well, I figured there'd be somebody else.

961
00:56:17.710 --> 00:56:22.948
我也是，但我是说，我没想到会这样。看看你们这些家伙。就像是向上爬。
Me, too, but I mean, I didn't expect this. Look at you guys. It's like Up.

962
00:56:25.686 --> 00:56:27.754
你想喝杯香槟吗？
Would you like a glass of champagne?

963
00:56:27.789 --> 00:56:30.793
不，我只喝Jager和红牛。但是谢谢你。
No, I only drink Jager and Red Bull. But thank you.

964
00:56:30.828 --> 00:56:35.191
哦，好吧，至少你永远不用担心自己是我们这个年龄的人。
Oh, well, at least you'll never have to worry about being our age.

965
00:56:37.365 --> 00:56:41.169
听着，我们真的只是在同一时间玩而互相伤害，
Look, we're really only hurting each other by playing at the same time,

966
00:56:41.205 --> 00:56:43.703
所以这里有一个更好的提议。
so here's a better offer.

967
00:56:43.738 --> 00:56:47.441
你加入我的团队，把你的资金加到我们的锅里，
You join my group, add your capital to our pot,

968
00:56:47.477 --> 00:56:49.141
我们会处理所有的赌注。
and we'll handle all the betting.

969
00:56:51.445 --> 00:56:53.550
嗯，我不知道。
Well, I don't know.

970
00:56:54.385 --> 00:56:56.454
我们有点喜欢做自己的事。
We kind of like to do our own thing.

971
00:56:56.953 --> 00:56:58.080
什么
What?

972
00:56:58.115 --> 00:57:00.352
你不用做任何事就可以得到一个伤口。
You'll get a cut without having to do anything.

973
00:57:00.387 --> 00:57:05.463
我有一群赌徒。你甚至不用离开你的摇椅。
I have an army of bettors. You won't even have to leave your rocking chairs.

974
00:57:06.128 --> 00:57:07.465
我们很好。
We're good.

975
00:57:07.500 --> 00:57:10.862
这是关于赚钱的。你喜欢钱，对吧？
This is about making money. You like money, right?

976
00:57:10.897 --> 00:57:14.498
嗯，没有我喜欢其他东西那么多。
Well, not as much as I like other things.

977
00:57:14.533 --> 00:57:16.233
哦，我的天啊。
Oh, my God.

978
00:57:16.269 --> 00:57:22.679
呃，现在，听着，如果你们两个不介意的话，这是我们的周年纪念日。
Uh, now, look, if you two don't mind, this is our anniversary.

979
00:57:22.714 --> 00:57:27.516
你正在破坏我们酒类店的气氛。
And you are killing the ambience of our liquor store.

980
00:57:27.551 --> 00:57:30.382
欢迎您乘坐红牛上路。
You're welcome to take a Red Bull for the road.

981
00:57:30.418 --> 00:57:32.919
或者一个果汁盒。
Or maybe a juice box.

982
00:57:38.931 --> 00:57:40.223
你的数学很好。
You're good at math.

983
00:57:40.964 --> 00:57:42.830
耶！
Yay!

984
00:57:42.865 --> 00:57:44.965
我相信这对农场很有帮助，但在哈佛，
I'm sure that helps out on the farm, but at Harvard,

985
00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:47.901
我们学习了一种叫做二项式分布的东西。
we learn a little something called binomial distribution.

986
00:57:48.874 --> 00:57:50.403
查一查。
Look it up.

987
00:57:50.438 --> 00:57:53.075
然后，当你填写自己的单子时，你就会明白为什么你的胜算会更大。
Then you'll see why your odds are better when you fill out your own slips.

988
00:57:53.110 --> 00:57:54.776
不客气。
You're welcome.

989
00:57:54.811 --> 00:58:00.176
二项分布只考虑两个因素。
Binomial distribution only considers two factors.

990
00:58:00.212 --> 00:58:03.248
没有第三次，这是人为错误，也没有第四次，
Not a third, which is human error, or a fourth,

991
00:58:03.283 --> 00:58:07.790
这就是你填票所需的时间。
which is the time it takes for you to fill in the tickets.

992
00:58:07.825 --> 00:58:13.828
每赢10万美元，你就赚32美元。
You gain a whooping 32 bucks for every $100,000 you win.

993
00:58:15.495 --> 00:58:16.732
不客气。
You're welcome.

994
00:58:18.499 --> 00:58:20.197
认真地闭嘴！
Seriously? Shut up!

995
00:58:24.340 --> 00:58:25.675
什么
What?

996
00:58:27.140 --> 00:58:30.474
我想如果没有愚蠢的青少年，那就不会是一场舞会。
I guess it wouldn't be a prom without dumb teenagers.

997
00:58:33.011 --> 00:58:36.052
这让我想起了我们结束的地方。
That reminds me of where we left off.

998
00:59:05.348 --> 00:59:07.042
所以我得到了房子？
So I get the house?

999
00:59:07.078 --> 00:59:08.751
对你得到了一切。
Yes. You get everything.

1000
00:59:08.786 --> 00:59:13.849
比尔只是想保留他在GS战略中的份额。
Bill just wants to keep his share of GS Strategies.

1001
00:59:13.885 --> 00:59:15.989
无论什么我拿到了房子。
Whatever. I got the house.

1002
00:59:18.627 --> 00:59:21.130
祝你好运，坎迪斯。
Well, good luck to you, Candace.

1003
00:59:21.165 --> 00:59:24.565
你知道，我们在那里度过了好几年，然后一切都变糟了。
You know, we had a few good years there before it all turned to shit.

1004
00:59:24.600 --> 00:59:26.637
我希望你能找到你的青蛙。
And I hope you find your frog.

1005
00:59:27.400 --> 00:59:28.606
嗯哼。
Uh-huh.

1006
00:59:30.308 --> 00:59:33.808
嘿，GS到底是什么？
Hey, what is GS whatever?

1007
00:59:33.844 --> 00:59:36.413
哦，是的。那是一家我参加的小公司。
Oh, yeah. That's a little company I'm a part of.

1008
00:59:36.448 --> 00:59:37.912
呃，我们每个月都中彩票。
Uh, we win the lottery every month.

1009
00:59:47.059 --> 00:59:48.626
回头见。
See you around.

1010
00:59:58.966 --> 01:00:01.263
我想重开冰淇淋店。
I'd love to re-open the ice cream shop.

1011
01:00:01.299 --> 01:00:04.904
嗯，现在你可以以每年1.19美元的价格租赁它。
Well, now you can lease it for $1.19 a year.

1012
01:00:04.939 --> 01:00:07.704
剩下的钱将由市区基金支付。
And the Downtown fund will cover the rest.

1013
01:00:07.739 --> 01:00:10.074
$1.19? 嗯哼。
$1.19? Mmm-hmm.

1014
01:00:10.109 --> 01:00:13.448
哦，是欧元。这是一个复杂的故事。
Oh, it's a euro. It's a complicated story.

1015
01:00:13.483 --> 01:00:15.152
杰瑞可以向你解释。
Jerry can explain it to you.

1016
01:00:26.592 --> 01:00:28.664
天啊，天啊。
Boy, oh, boy.

1017
01:00:28.700 --> 01:00:31.432
我刚买了一辆轻巡洋舰。是的，我看得出来。
I just bought a Corvette. Yeah, I can see that.

1018
01:00:31.467 --> 01:00:35.539
你想下周去兜风吗？我要乘船去Me-hi-co。
You want to take it for a ride next week? I'm going on a cruise to Me-hi-co.

1019
01:00:35.574 --> 01:00:38.672
哦，不，我想我没法参与进来。
Oh, no, I don't think I can get into it.

1020
01:00:38.707 --> 01:00:41.178
好吧，老头子，随你的便。
All right, old man, suit yourself.

1021
01:00:41.213 --> 01:00:42.441
还有另一组。
There's another group.

1022
01:00:42.476 --> 01:00:44.074
不，是的。
No. Yep.

1023
01:00:44.110 --> 01:00:46.512
一些哈佛的孩子发现了这一点。
Some kids from Harvard figured it out.

1024
01:00:46.547 --> 01:00:48.283
好吧，那太糟糕了。
Well, that sucks.

1025
01:00:48.318 --> 01:00:49.879
我们应该没事的。
We should be okay.

1026
01:00:49.914 --> 01:00:54.457
我们仍然赢得了足够的胜利，人们可以重建爵士音乐节。
We're still winning enough for people to rebuild and get the jazz fest going.

1027
01:00:54.493 --> 01:00:56.759
我们必须留在比赛中。
We just have to stay in the game.

1028
01:00:56.794 --> 01:00:59.357
我们会的。嗯，你说得很容易。
And we will. Well, that's easy for you to say.

1029
01:00:59.393 --> 01:01:02.293
你不能连续五天站在机器前。
You're not standing at a machine for five days straight.

1030
01:01:03.060 --> 01:01:04.365
我说我要换班。
I said I would take a shift.

1031
01:01:04.401 --> 01:01:05.667
不，不，没关系。
No, no. That's okay.

1032
01:01:05.703 --> 01:01:07.604
是的，因为你们喜欢，对吧？
Yeah, because you guys like it, right?

1033
01:01:07.640 --> 01:01:10.367
是的，我们有。是的，你知道。是的，你知道。
Yeah, we do. Yeah, you do. Yeah, you do.

1034
01:01:11.675 --> 01:01:13.810
很高兴你休息了一天。
So glad you got the day off.

1035
01:01:13.845 --> 01:01:15.973
嗯，我感觉不是这样的。哦，哦。。。
Well, it doesn't feel like I did. Oh, oh...

1036
01:01:16.008 --> 01:01:17.973
你们几个星期是怎么做到的？
How did you guys do this for weeks?

1037
01:01:18.009 --> 01:01:19.713
因为这是一次冒险。
Because it's an adventure.

1038
01:01:19.748 --> 01:01:21.515
哦，不，这不是冒险。
Oh, no, this is not an adventure.

1039
01:01:21.550 --> 01:01:25.816
在一家充斥着妓女和毒贩的汽车旅馆里，人们看到了剪纸。
It's getting paper cuts in a motel filled with prostitutes and drug dealers.

1040
01:01:25.851 --> 01:01:27.656
哦
Oh.

1041
01:01:27.691 --> 01:01:29.590
Dawn你不必这么做。
Well, Dawn, you don't have to do it.

1042
01:01:29.625 --> 01:01:31.522
哦，不，不，我想。我愿意。
Oh, no, no, I want to. I do.

1043
01:01:31.557 --> 01:01:35.428
我的意思是，我从来没有时间和你们在一起，而且，你知道。。。
I mean, I never get to spend time with you guys, and, you know...

1044
01:01:35.463 --> 01:01:39.899
感觉被困在一家大酒店里，把丢失的票塞满了垃圾箱
Feeling trapped in a gross hotel, filling bins with losing tickets

1045
01:01:39.935 --> 01:01:43.004
只是一段我永远不会忘记的记忆。
is just a memory I will never ever forget.

1046
01:01:44.409 --> 01:01:47.207
哎呀。这个是赢家。
Oops. This one's a winner.

1047
01:01:47.242 --> 01:01:51.344
哦，你错过了。可以我做完了。我做完了。
Oh, you missed it. Okay. I'm done. I'm done.

1048
01:01:51.379 --> 01:01:53.749
嘿，你什么时候才能把所有的优胜者都交出来？
Hey, when's the part where you get to turn in all the winners?

1049
01:01:53.784 --> 01:01:56.719
因为我会这么做。嗯，那很有趣。
Because I will do that. Well, that is fun.

1050
01:01:56.755 --> 01:02:00.049
我们必须仔细检查所有。。。
We're gonna have to double check all the...

1051
01:02:00.085 --> 01:02:03.057
这家汽车旅馆有酒吧吗？
Is there a bar at this motel?

1052
01:02:11.631 --> 01:02:12.935
Grazio先生？
Mr. Grazio?

玛雅·乔登。波士顿环球报。

我有一些关于WinFall游戏的问题。
I had some questions about the WinFall game.

1055
01:02:20.845 --> 01:02:23.143
梅勒妮·霍金斯负责我们的宣传工作。
Well, Melanie Hawkins handles our publicity.

1056
01:02:23.178 --> 01:02:26.008
但这场比赛对该州来说是一个巨大的成功。
But the game has been a huge success for the state.

1057
01:02:26.043 --> 01:02:27.877
不仅仅是为了国家。
Not just for the state.

1058
01:02:27.912 --> 01:02:30.716
你知道密歇根州有一个球员每月赢得数百万美元吗？
Are you aware there's a player in Michigan winning millions every month?

1059
01:02:30.751 --> 01:02:34.519
我们为学校筹集了大量资金，但没有人就此发表文章。
We raise a lot of money for schools, but nobody does an article about that.

1060
01:02:34.554 --> 01:02:38.120
一些退休人员运气好，他们派了一个聚光灯记者？
Some retiree gets lucky and they send a Spotlight reporter?

1061
01:02:38.155 --> 01:02:40.160
我没说他是退休人员。
I didn't say he was a retiree.

1062
01:02:41.667 --> 01:02:43.193
是的，嗯，你知道，这是彩票。
Yeah, well, you know, it's a lottery.

人们会赢。所以，这不是新闻。
People win. So, wouldn't call it news.

1064

他们说我会在这里找到你。
They said I'd find you here.

1071
01:03:25.607 --> 01:03:26.870
你想要什么？
What do you want?

1072
01:03:26.906 --> 01:03:28.610
这不会花很长时间的。
This won't take long.

1073
01:03:28.645 --> 01:03:30.643
我们不会加入你的团队。
We're not joining your group.

1074
01:03:30.678 --> 01:03:31.946
我不想让你这么做。
I don't want you to.

1075

我真的不再需要你的资金了。

1076
01:03:34.553 --> 01:03:35.649
我只需要你退出比赛。
I just need you out of the game.

1077
01:03:35.684 --> 01:03:38.387
那么，你出局了。什么
So, you're out. What?

1078
01:03:38.422 --> 01:03:42.854
看，你在计算人方面不如在计算数字方面好。
See, you're not really as good at calculating people as you are numbers.

1079
01:03:42.889 --> 01:03:47.425
所以你还没有真正计算出像我这样的人会做什么来赢得比赛。
So you haven't really run the math on what somebody like me would do to win.

1080
01:03:54.439 --> 01:03:56.467
你会怎么做？
And what would you do?

1081
01:03:57.835 --> 01:04:00.807
让一群你见过的最聪明的孩子来反对你
Set an army of the smartest kids you've ever met against you

1082
01:04:00.842 --> 01:04:02.473
和你一起玩的每个人。
and everyone you play with.

1083
01:04:04.249 --> 01:04:08.314
我们侵入了州彩票，想知道你在哪里下注。
We hacked into the state lottery to find where you were betting.

1084
01:04:09.515 --> 01:04:13.484
你不认为我们可以侵入你的账户吗？
You don't think that we can hack into your accounts?

1085
01:04:14.460 --> 01:04:17.554
你的信用？你的身份？
Your credit? Your identity?

1086
01:04:18.827 --> 01:04:20.890
这并不难。我是说。。。
It won't be hard. I mean...

1087
01:04:20.926 --> 01:04:24.231
大多数人认为防火墙是他们烟囱里的东西，所以。。。
Most of them think a firewall is something in their chimney, so...

1088
01:04:25.668 --> 01:04:28.100
你为什么要这样做？
Why are you doing this?

1089
01:04:28.135 --> 01:04:31.205
这只是数学。没什么私人的。
It's just math. Nothing personal.

1090
01:04:32.170 --> 01:04:34.676
听着，你跑得很好。
Look, you had a good run.

1091
01:04:34.712 --> 01:04:37.544
你为梅贝里赚了些钱。
You made some cash for Mayberry.

1092
01:04:37.579 --> 01:04:39.312
但一切都结束了。
But it's over.

1093
01:04:41.112 --> 01:04:42.579
享受你的黄金岁月。
Enjoy your golden years.

1094
01:04:59.167 --> 01:05:03.435
嘿，你认为我们需要多少天？
Hey, so how many days do you think we'll need?

1095
01:05:05.243 --> 01:05:06.339
没有一个
None.

1096
01:05:07.171 --> 01:05:08.506
我们退出了比赛。
We're out of the game.

1097
01:05:12.450 --> 01:05:13.712
杰瑞！
Jerry!

1098
01:05:21.920 --> 01:05:23.961
哦嗯
Oh... Uh...

1099
01:05:25.528 --> 01:05:28.196
可以嗯
Okay. Uh.

1100
01:05:29.600 --> 01:05:31.531
哦，孩子。呃呃。。。
Oh, boy. Well, uh...

1101
01:05:31.566 --> 01:05:38.305
我很难过地报告，由于游戏中出现了一些新的变量。。。
I'm sad to report that, due to some new variables in the game...

1102
01:05:38.837 --> 01:05:40.139
嗯。。。
Um...

1103
01:05:40.174 --> 01:05:42.808
我们将不得不停止比赛。
We're going to have to stop playing.

1104
01:05:57.724 --> 01:05:59.029
嗯。。。
Um...

1105
01:06:00.090 --> 01:06:01.625
我很抱歉。
I am sorry.

1106
01:06:26.988 --> 01:06:32.392
那么，你真的要让一些大学里的聪明人把这一切都夺走？
So, you're really going to let some college smartass take all this away from you?

1107
01:06:34.760 --> 01:06:38.462
他可能会做些什么的可能性大于好处。。。
The odds that he might do something outweigh the benefits...

1108
01:06:38.498 --> 01:06:42.732
这与数学无关。这是关于做人的。
It's not about the math. It's about being human.

1109
01:06:48.041 --> 01:06:49.475
你知道，爸爸，我。。。
You know, Dad, I...

1110
01:06:51.279 --> 01:06:53.180
我看着你花了这么多时间
I've watched you spend so much of your life

1111
01:06:53.215 --> 01:06:56.350
只是被忽视和推来推去。
just being overlooked and pushed around.

1112
01:06:58.723 --> 01:07:00.750
没人知道你能做什么。
Nobody knew what you could do.

1113
01:07:02.153 --> 01:07:03.456
没人在乎。
Nobody cared.

1114
01:07:05.023 --> 01:07:10.430
然后你终于开枪了，你把我们都带来了。
And then you finally took your shot, and you brought us all with you.

1115
01:07:11.863 --> 01:07:15.501
你知道你做了什么吗？你让我们的小镇感觉大了。
You know what you did? You made our little town feel big.

1116
01:07:16.875 --> 01:07:18.471
这就是为什么他们都在那里。
That's why they're all in there.

1117
01:07:20.305 --> 01:07:22.145
这就是为什么我在那里。
That's why I was in there.

1118
01:07:39.795 --> 01:07:41.296
他会没事的。
He'll be okay.

1119
01:07:48.565 --> 01:07:51.306
你知道我为什么不喜欢钓鱼吗？
You know why I don't like to fish?

1120
01:07:52.574 --> 01:07:53.704
不
No.

1121
01:07:54.838 --> 01:07:58.778
上次我去的时候，我把他带走了。
The last time that I went, I took him with me.

1122
01:07:58.814 --> 01:08:02.515
他16、17岁。
He was 16, 17.

1123
01:08:04.552 --> 01:08:10.587
然后我开始计算bobber移动的速度
And I started calculating how fast the bobber was moving

1124
01:08:10.622 --> 01:08:13.658
所以我可以计算出水流的速度。
so I can figure out the speed of the current.

1125
01:08:15.365 --> 01:08:20.599
然后我听到他问我，“爸爸，你觉得怎么样？”
And then I hear him ask me, "What do you think, Dad?"

1126
01:08:23.206 --> 01:08:27.538
就在那一刻，我意识到
And it was at that moment that I realized

1127
01:08:27.573 --> 01:08:32.041
他在谈论一个他喜欢的女孩。
he was talking about a girl that he liked.

1128
01:08:32.077 --> 01:08:33.414
和哦
And... Oh.

1129
01:08:34.586 --> 01:08:36.252
我不知道。
I had no idea.

1130
01:08:37.215 --> 01:08:38.452
你知道，这是。。。
You know, it's...

1131
01:08:39.552 --> 01:08:42.753
这从来不是一份礼物。这是个骗局。
It's never been a gift. It's been a trick.

1132
01:08:44.289 --> 01:08:46.159
你的大脑告诉你
Your brain tells you

1133
01:08:46.195 --> 01:08:50.561
你看到别人看不到的东西，
that you see what other's don't,

1134
01:08:50.596 --> 01:08:55.667
但最终，你看到的只是更少。
but in the end, you're just seeing less.

1135
01:09:00.445 --> 01:09:01.877
嗯
Uh...

1136
01:09:01.913 --> 01:09:05.446
我想今晚我会步行回家。
I think I'll walk home tonight.

1137
01:09:20.458 --> 01:09:24.094
好了，伙计们，这将是一场大比赛。现在是我们所有人的事了，所以让它有意义吧。
All right, guys, it's gonna be a big one. It's all of us now, so make it count.

1138
01:09:24.129 --> 01:09:25.631
走，走，走。
Go, go, go.

1139
01:09:29.236 --> 01:09:30.768
这个周末要滚下来。
Roll down's this weekend.

1140
01:09:32.776 --> 01:09:35.212
嗯，我知道。
Mmm-hmm. I know.

1141
01:09:46.223 --> 01:09:48.322
我只是想做正确的事。
I'm just trying to do the right thing.

1142
01:09:48.357 --> 01:09:52.759
哦，你总是这样。我喜欢你这样。
Oh, you always do. I love that about you.

1143
01:09:52.794 --> 01:09:56.332
这就是为什么镇上每个人都相信你会冒险的原因。
And that's why everyone in town trusts you to take a chance.

1144
01:09:57.563 --> 01:10:00.534
我从没见过你做过的一件事
The one thing I have never seen you do

1145
01:10:00.569 --> 01:10:04.201
就是在你找到解决方案之前放弃一个问题。
is give up on a problem before you find a solution.

1146
01:10:04.236 --> 01:10:05.839
什么意思？
What do you mean?

1147
01:10:05.875 --> 01:10:10.139
你已经计算了Tyler的威胁和比赛的价值，
Well, you've calculated Tyler's threat, and the value of the game,

1148
01:10:10.174 --> 01:10:15.212
但二项分布没有考虑第三个因素。
but binomial distribution doesn't consider the third factor.

1149
01:10:15.248 --> 01:10:18.915
只要你和我拥有彼此，我们就不怕愚蠢。
That as long as you and I have each other, we are not afraid to be stupid.

1150
01:10:22.860 --> 01:10:24.319
你疯了。
You're batshit crazy.

1151
01:10:31.231 --> 01:10:32.866
哦，史蒂夫在那里。
Oh, there's Steve.

1152
01:10:35.237 --> 01:10:37.435
我们要去马萨诸塞州。
We're heading to Massachusetts.

1153
01:10:37.470 --> 01:10:41.577
哈哈！我懂你！去抓住他们，孩子！
Ha-ha! I see you! Go get 'em, boy!

1154
01:10:59.528 --> 01:11:04.827
哇！是的，我们来吧！玛吉！跟我击掌相庆。
Whoa! Yeah, let's do this! Marge! Give me five.

1155
01:11:04.862 --> 01:11:08.437
杰瑞！你是个疯子。揍我一顿。
Jerry! You're a madman. Pound me.

1156
01:11:11.641 --> 01:11:13.410
我以为没有分裂的话应该更多。
I thought it was supposed to be more without the split.

1157
01:11:13.445 --> 01:11:18.474
您是否检查了其他索赔？对有一个。
Did you check for other claims? Yes. There was one.

1158
01:11:18.509 --> 01:11:20.880
哪里桑德兰。
Where? Sunderland.

1159
01:11:20.915 --> 01:11:22.345
倒霉！
Shit!

1160
01:11:22.380 --> 01:11:25.419
他骗了你，好吗？我们只能接受它。
He called your bluff, okay? There's nothing we can do but accept it.

1161
01:11:25.455 --> 01:11:27.423
如果有滚下来的话，他就要上场了。
If there's a roll down, he's going to play.

1162
01:11:28.589 --> 01:11:31.391
除非我们创建向下滚动。什么
Unless we create the roll down. What?

1163
01:11:31.427 --> 01:11:33.493
滚下来需要几个星期，对吧？
It takes weeks for a roll down, right?

1164
01:11:33.528 --> 01:11:36.192
我是说，WinFall每天收入10万美元，
I mean, WinFall takes in 100 grand a day,

1165
01:11:36.228 --> 01:11:38.933
然后当它达到200万的时候，我们知道会有一个下降，
and then when it hits two million, we know a roll down is coming in,

1166
01:11:38.968 --> 01:11:42.231
每个人都开始下注，本杰明·巴顿上了他的卡车。
and everybody starts betting, and Benjamin Button gets in his truck.

1167
01:11:42.267 --> 01:11:46.470
但是，如果我们在没有人预料的情况下创建一个滚降，那么我们将全部接受。
But if we create a roll down when nobody expects it, we take it all.

1168
01:11:46.506 --> 01:11:48.342
我们把其他球员挤了出来。
We squeeze the other players out.

1169
01:11:48.377 --> 01:11:50.512
我们用黑客追踪大麻，
We use our hack to track the pot,

1170
01:11:50.547 --> 01:11:53.209
我们等着它达到一百万，然后才开始抽奖，
we wait for it to hit a million before a drawing,

1171
01:11:53.245 --> 01:11:56.184
然后我们在一天内下注一百万。我的意思是，我们拥有这场比赛。
and then we bet a million in one day. I mean, we own the game.

1172
01:11:56.219 --> 01:11:59.081
我们从哪里得到100万美元？
And where do we get $1 million?

1173
01:12:02.523 --> 01:12:05.591
正如你从我们的回报中所看到的，它是有效的。
As you can see by our returns, it works.

1174
01:12:05.626 --> 01:12:08.128
有了更多的资本，我们就能控制比赛。
And with more capital, we can control the game.

1175
01:12:08.163 --> 01:12:09.762
你爸爸也参与了吗？
Is your dad in on this?

1176
01:12:10.329 --> 01:12:12.497
不，他。。。嗯。。。
No. He... Um...

1177
01:12:12.533 --> 01:12:14.930
以为你会上大学？
Thinks you're going to college?

1178
01:12:14.966 --> 01:12:17.640
他认为我正在学习成为一名律师，就像他一样。
He thinks I'm studying to be a lawyer, like him.

1179
01:12:17.676 --> 01:12:21.444
但上次我查了一下，我父亲从来没有一夜赚过一百万美元。
But last time I checked, my father never made $1 million in a night.

1180
01:12:25.248 --> 01:12:26.915
我们有14个小时来完成这件事。
We have 14 hours to pull this off.

1181
01:12:26.950 --> 01:12:29.412
到你的位置，在你打印完所有的票之前不要离开。
Get to your location and don't leave until you print all your tickets.

1182
01:12:29.447 --> 01:12:32.789
有些地方可能会全天推迟打印，但不允许这样做。
Some locations might push back on printing all day, but do not let them.

1183
01:12:32.824 --> 01:12:33.921
他们为我们工作。
They work for us.

1184
01:12:33.956 --> 01:12:35.023
我们骑吧。
Let's ride.

1185
01:12:35.059 --> 01:12:36.052
-是的哇哦！
- Yes! - Whoo!

1186
01:12:36.992 --> 01:12:37.988
是 啊
Yeah.

1187
01:12:39.628 --> 01:12:43.196
嘿如果有人中了头奖怎么办
Hey. What happens if somebody wins the jackpot

1188
01:12:43.231 --> 01:12:45.601
我们损失了100万美元？
and we lose $1 million?

1189
01:12:45.637 --> 01:12:48.735
除了因为我花光了全部学费而辍学之外？
Beyond dropping out of school because I blew my entire tuition?

1190
01:12:50.003 --> 01:12:52.170
我想其中一个投资者可能真的会杀了我。
I think one of those investors might actually kill me.

1191
01:12:52.205 --> 01:12:54.243
哦。
Ooh.

1192
01:12:54.278 --> 01:12:56.712
你没事吧？是的，我知道了。
You all right? Yeah, I got it.

1193
01:12:56.747 --> 01:12:58.811
哦可以
Oh. Okay.

1194
01:13:00.785 --> 01:13:01.982
我拿到钥匙了。
I got the key.

1195
01:13:03.250 --> 01:13:04.718
搞什么鬼？
What the heck?

1196
01:13:05.855 --> 01:13:07.052
哦
Oh.

1197
01:13:07.088 --> 01:13:08.458
嘿
Hey!

1198
01:13:09.454 --> 01:13:10.590
我们错过了！
We missed it!

1199
01:13:10.625 --> 01:13:13.325
什么，有人真的打了六个号码？
What, someone actually hit all six numbers?

1200
01:13:13.360 --> 01:13:14.628
不，不，它滚下来了。
No. No. It rolled down.

1201
01:13:14.664 --> 01:13:17.166
不，那是不可能的。这才是第二周。
No, that's impossible. It's only the second week.

1202
01:13:17.201 --> 01:13:19.093
三点之前它不会滚下来。
It never rolls down before three.

1203
01:13:19.129 --> 01:13:21.438
昨晚它滚了下来，我们错过了。
It rolled down last night, and we missed it.

1204
01:13:24.871 --> 01:13:27.475
哈佛集团自己触发了这一事件。
The Harvard group triggered it on their own.

1205
01:13:27.510 --> 01:13:29.278
他们怎么知道该赌多少？
How would they know how much to bet?

1206
01:13:29.314 --> 01:13:31.473
彩票没有公布金额。。。
The lottery doesn't post the amount...

1207
01:13:31.509 --> 01:13:33.109
嗯，他们知道。
Well, they knew.

1208
01:13:34.114 --> 01:13:35.111
杰瑞？
Jerry?

1209
01:13:37.715 --> 01:13:39.115
杰瑞，你要去哪里？
Where are you going, Jerry?

1210
01:13:41.323 --> 01:13:42.855
杰瑞！
Jerry!

1211
01:14:15.257 --> 01:14:18.557
这在新闻里。彩票甚至没想到它会来。
It's on the freakin' news. The lottery didn't even see it coming.

1212
01:14:18.592 --> 01:14:20.563
这太史诗了。
This is so epic.

1213
01:14:22.867 --> 01:14:24.026
嘿Jerry。
Hey, Jerry.

1214
01:14:24.061 --> 01:14:26.069
什么，你开拖拉机进来了吗
What, did you come ridin' in on your tractor

1215
01:14:26.104 --> 01:14:27.564
来给我一声欢呼？
to come give me a whoopin'?

1216
01:14:27.599 --> 01:14:29.968
相信我，我想这么做。
Believe me, I wanted to.

1217
01:14:31.537 --> 01:14:33.103
我的一部分仍然如此。
Part of me still does.

1218
01:14:35.412 --> 01:14:39.414
但是在这里的长途车程中，
But then on the long drive here,

1219
01:14:39.449 --> 01:14:43.046
嗯，大部分都消失了。
well, most of that just, poof, went away.

1220
01:14:43.082 --> 01:14:46.754
我意识到我并不是真的生你的气。
And I realized that I wasn't really angry at you.

1221
01:14:47.321 --> 01:14:49.290
我很失望。
I'm disappointed.

1222
01:14:49.325 --> 01:14:50.986
噢，你对我失望了？
Aw, you're disappointed in me?

1223
01:14:51.021 --> 01:14:53.292
不，不是你。你无足轻重。
No, not you. You're insignificant.

1224
01:14:53.328 --> 01:14:59.729
不，我很失望我让你这样自私的孩子接近了我。呵呵。
No, I was disappointed that I let a selfish kid like you get to me. Huh.

1225
01:14:59.764 --> 01:15:03.100
我的数学一直很好，
I was always good with math,

1226
01:15:03.135 --> 01:15:08.609
但我花了很长时间才弄清楚人们的想法。
but it took a long time for me to figure people out.

1227
01:15:08.644 --> 01:15:12.346
那么，告诉我们，杰瑞，你发现了什么？
So, tell us, Jerry, what did you figure out?

1228
01:15:12.382 --> 01:15:15.644
解决方案不是数字。
That the solution isn't numbers.

1229
01:15:15.679 --> 01:15:21.551
你告诉我我买彩票是因为我没有别的东西。
You told me that I was playing the lottery because I had nothing else.

1230
01:15:21.587 --> 01:15:29.096
但你不愿意分享大麻的原因是因为你没有其他东西。
But the reason you won't share the pot is because you have nothing else.

1231
01:15:29.131 --> 01:15:33.667
你认为做房间里最聪明的人才是最重要的。
You think being the smartest guy in the room is all that matters.

1232
01:15:33.702 --> 01:15:39.268
但事实证明，这个房间才是最重要的。
But it turns out it's this room that matters.

1233
01:15:39.303 --> 01:15:44.108
所有这些聪明的年轻人都在帮助你致富。
All these bright, young people helping you get rich.

1234
01:15:46.513 --> 01:15:49.651
你如何帮助他们？
How are you helping them?

1235
01:15:49.687 --> 01:15:53.220
看来你还没算出来吧？
Guess you haven't run the math out on that, huh?

1236
01:15:55.325 --> 01:15:58.628
无论如何我的拖拉机开动了。
Anyway...my tractor's running.

1237
01:16:02.862 --> 01:16:05.063
祝大家好运。
I wish you all the best of luck.

1238
01:16:14.840 --> 01:16:17.680
什么继续数数吧。
What? Just get back to counting.

1239
01:16:19.643 --> 01:16:24.617
如果哈佛大学队能够触发一个滚降，他们就可以进行比赛。
If the Harvard team can trigger a roll down, they run the game.

1240
01:16:24.653 --> 01:16:26.254
所以我们触发我们自己的滚降。
So we trigger our own roll down.

1241
01:16:26.289 --> 01:16:27.956
是的，我们有足够的现金。
Yeah, we have enough cash.

1242
01:16:27.992 --> 01:16:29.152
没有，为什么？
No. Why?

1243
01:16:29.187 --> 01:16:31.987
因为这对普通球员不公平。
Because it's not fair to the regular players.

1244
01:16:32.023 --> 01:16:33.755
他是对的。这不是我们是谁。
He's right. It's not who we are.

1245
01:16:33.791 --> 01:16:34.993
但我们太接近了。
But we're so close.

1246
01:16:35.028 --> 01:16:37.593
我的意思是，市中心又回来了，爵士音乐节就要来了。
I mean, downtown is back, the jazz fest is coming.

1247
01:16:37.628 --> 01:16:40.268
如果我们继续获胜，我们实际上可以雇个人在那里踢球。
If we keep winning, we could actually hire somebody to play there.

1248
01:16:40.304 --> 01:16:41.396
你应该找铁石心肠的丹。
You should get Steely Dan.

1249
01:16:41.431 --> 01:16:44.240
这是一个惊人的想法。我们应该找钢铁丹。
That is an amazing idea. We should get Steely Dan.

1250
01:16:44.275 --> 01:16:46.241
如果我们不能比赛，我们就赢不了。
We can't win if we can't play.

1251
01:16:46.276 --> 01:16:47.602
好吧，这太糟糕了。
Well, this just sucks.

1252
01:16:47.638 --> 01:16:51.176
彩票并没有阻止我们，但一群大学生阻止了我们？
The lottery isn't stopping us, but a bunch of college kids are?

1253
01:16:51.211 --> 01:16:54.681
嗯，这是一个很好的观点。是什么？我没说什么。
Huh, that's a good point. What is? I wasn't making a point.

1254
01:16:54.716 --> 01:16:57.880
为什么彩票不能阻止他们？
Why isn't the lottery stopping them?

1255
01:16:57.915 --> 01:17:00.382
那是因为他们不在乎。
It's because they don't care.

1256
01:17:01.420 --> 01:17:02.659
哦
Oh.

1257
01:17:03.260 --> 01:17:04.727
这可能是我们的答案。
That could be our answer.

1258
01:17:10.199 --> 01:17:14.998
很高兴见到我们忠诚的球员，塞尔比先生和夫人。
Always happy to meet with our loyal players, Mr. and Mrs. Selbee.

1259
01:17:15.034 --> 01:17:18.334
哦，求你了。“杰瑞和玛吉”很好。
Oh, please. "Jerry and Marge" is fine.

1260
01:17:19.409 --> 01:17:20.507
我们能帮你做些什么？
What can we help you with?

1261
01:17:20.542 --> 01:17:21.743
事情是这样的。
So here's the thing.

1262
01:17:21.778 --> 01:17:25.712
几年前，州彩票亏损，
The state lottery was losing money a few years ago,

1263
01:17:25.748 --> 01:17:27.977
几乎没有人中头奖，
and hardly anybody was winning the jackpot,

1264
01:17:28.013 --> 01:17:31.819
所以百万富翁吃了你的午餐。
so Mega Millions ate your lunch.

1265
01:17:31.855 --> 01:17:35.158
然后是WinFall，一切都变了。
Then along comes WinFall, and all that changes.

1266
01:17:35.193 --> 01:17:37.287
你们赚了几百万，
You folks made millions,

1267
01:17:37.322 --> 01:17:41.456
在你意识到数学有缺陷之前。
before you realized there was a flaw in the math.

1268
01:17:42.400 --> 01:17:44.963
一开始你可能很惊慌，
You probably panicked at first,

1269
01:17:44.999 --> 01:17:47.930
因为你知道一旦每个人都看到了，
because you knew that once everybody saw it,

1270
01:17:47.965 --> 01:17:50.470
游戏会崩溃。
that the game would collapse.

1271
01:17:50.505 --> 01:17:52.540
但他们没有看到。
Except they didn't see it.

1272
01:17:52.576 --> 01:17:55.910
只有我和几个哈佛的孩子。
Only me and a few kids from Harvard.

1273
01:17:55.945 --> 01:17:59.308
这意味着我们在游戏中投入了数百万美元，
Which meant that we were pushing millions into the game,

1274
01:17:59.343 --> 01:18:02.411
还有，孩子，把你的利润送上了屋顶。
and, boy, sent your profits through the roof.

1275
01:18:03.921 --> 01:18:09.324
所以，突然间，你的错误成了你的意外之财。
So, all of a sudden, your mistake became your windfall.

1276
01:18:09.359 --> 01:18:10.452
我给了他那句话。
I gave him that line.

1277
01:18:10.487 --> 01:18:13.158
是的，她确实做了，而且是个花花公子。
Yeah, she sure did, and it's a dandy.

1278
01:18:14.497 --> 01:18:16.329
那么，你到底想要什么？
So, what exactly do you want?

1279
01:18:16.365 --> 01:18:18.328
透明度
Transparency.

1280
01:18:18.364 --> 01:18:23.805
我们希望网站显示头奖的金额。
We'd like the website to show the size of the jackpot.

1281
01:18:23.840 --> 01:18:27.403
这可以防止任何组强制回滚。
That prevents any group from forcing a roll down.

1282
01:18:28.546 --> 01:18:31.508
这对任何玩游戏的人都是公平的。
Makes it fair for anybody who plays.

1283
01:18:31.544 --> 01:18:36.648
我们想在桑德兰的酒屋买两台机器。
And we would like two machines at the Liquor Hut in Sunderland.

1284
01:18:36.683 --> 01:18:38.183
所以我们可以在一起。
So we can be together.

1285
01:18:39.588 --> 01:18:41.450
这是我们的黄金岁月。
These are our golden years.

1286
01:18:47.958 --> 01:18:49.392
我们会处理好的。
We'll take care of it.

1287
01:18:50.294 --> 01:18:52.263
是的，我们很快就要上演另一出戏了。
Yeah, we'll be making another play soon.

1288
01:18:53.604 --> 01:18:57.301
很高兴听到你这么说。是 啊很快再谈。
That's great to hear. Yeah. Talk soon.

1289
01:18:57.336 --> 01:18:59.136
他想从公司引进其他合伙人。
He's wants to bring in other partners from the firm.

1290
01:18:59.171 --> 01:19:00.904
伙计，我们可能永远都不需要真正的工作。
Dude, we might not ever need a real job.

1291
01:19:00.939 --> 01:19:02.672
他们发了头奖。什么
They posted the jackpot. What?

1292
01:19:02.708 --> 01:19:06.679
彩票改变了网站。您可以在线跟踪jackpot。
The lottery changed the website. You can track the jackpot online.

1293
01:19:06.714 --> 01:19:08.249
我们不能再往下滚了。
We can't roll it down anymore.

1294
01:19:08.284 --> 01:19:10.314
倒霉。倒霉。
Shit. Shit.

1295
01:19:11.214 --> 01:19:14.051
好吧，让我们打破这个家伙。
All right, let's break this guy.

1296
01:19:14.086 --> 01:19:15.825
他想要一场战争？我们会给他一个。
He wants a war? We'll give him one.

1297
01:19:24.766 --> 01:19:28.204
你想吃玉米片吗？呃，没有。
You want some nachos? Uh, no.

1298
01:19:28.239 --> 01:19:29.465
是的，我来试试。
Yeah, I'll try some.

1299
01:19:32.606 --> 01:19:34.239
你知道，我很好。
You know, I'm good.

1300
01:19:44.922 --> 01:19:46.415
大家都在哪里？我们应该下注。
Where is everyone? We're supposed to be betting.

1301
01:19:46.450 --> 01:19:50.821
伙计，结束了。没有人想再这样做了。
Dude, it's over. Nobody wants to do it anymore.

1302
01:19:50.856 --> 01:19:52.294
什么为什么？我们赢了。
What? Why? We're winning.

1303
01:19:52.330 --> 01:19:54.928
不，我们是混蛋。
No. We're assholes.

1304
01:19:54.963 --> 01:19:57.229
除了你，这对任何人都不起作用。
And that doesn't work for anybody but you.

1305
01:19:59.030 --> 01:20:01.431
好的我会自己做的。
Fine. I'll do it on my own.

1306
01:20:21.624 --> 01:20:23.090
这太疯狂了。
It's gonna be insane.

1307
01:20:23.657 --> 01:20:25.122
疯子
Crazy.

1308
01:20:25.157 --> 01:20:27.423
我告诉过你我们应该。。。
I told you we should have...

1309
01:20:27.459 --> 01:20:29.162
-你拿到椒盐卷饼了吗？-是 啊
- Did you get the pretzels? - Yeah.

1310
01:20:33.363 --> 01:20:35.732
这是给你的。非常感谢。
This just came for you. Thank you.

1311
01:20:35.767 --> 01:20:37.434
哦最后
Oh. Finally.

1312
01:20:38.638 --> 01:20:39.906
薪水？
Paycheck?

1313
01:20:39.942 --> 01:20:42.478
好像我会为此感到兴奋。
Like I'd get excited about that.

1314
01:20:42.513 --> 01:20:45.878
不，国家彩票委员会。
No. State lottery commission.

1315
01:20:45.913 --> 01:20:47.380
他们不想和我说话，
They don't want to talk to me,

1316
01:20:47.415 --> 01:20:50.653
但任何赢得60000以上奖金的人都会被列入公开记录。
but anybody that wins above 60,000 is in the public record.

1317
01:20:50.688 --> 01:20:52.449
你只需要提交一个请求。
You just have to submit a request.

1318
01:20:52.485 --> 01:20:56.618
这是我在过去六个月里画的每一幅画。
Which I did, for every drawing in the last six months.

1319
01:20:57.662 --> 01:21:01.293
杰拉尔德·塞尔比，每三周一次。
Gerald Selbee, every three weeks.

1320
01:21:04.300 --> 01:21:05.330
嗯哼。
Mmm-hmm.

1321
01:21:06.030 --> 01:21:07.431
泰勒·朗福德。
Tyler Langford.

1322
01:21:09.505 --> 01:21:10.632
相同的图纸。
Same drawings.

1323
01:21:11.706 --> 01:21:13.041
还有一个。
There's another one.

1324
01:21:15.443 --> 01:21:17.139
呵呵。
Huh.

1325
01:21:17.175 --> 01:21:21.914
泰勒·朗福德。泰勒·朗福德。
Tyler Langford. Tyler Langford.

1326
01:21:21.950 --> 01:21:24.954
好吧Tyler Langford我看到你了。
Okay, Tyler Langford, I see you.

1327
01:21:27.657 --> 01:21:30.889
我花过的最好的一欧元。
Best euro I've ever spent.

1328
01:21:30.924 --> 01:21:32.525
谢谢Raj。非常感谢。
Thanks, Raj. Thank you.

1329
01:21:32.560 --> 01:21:33.556
好吧，女孩。
Okay, girl.

1330
01:21:38.469 --> 01:21:39.997
该死！哇！
Darn! Whoa!

1331
01:21:40.032 --> 01:21:41.669
再试一次，甜心。
Try one more time, sweetheart.

1332
01:21:41.704 --> 01:21:43.266
就像袋鼠一样。
Like a kangaroo.

1333
01:21:43.302 --> 01:21:45.634
嘿，你能给我一千万吗？是 啊
Hey, would you hand me a 10 mil? Yeah.

1334
01:21:47.475 --> 01:21:49.011
1000万。
Ten mil.

1335
01:21:49.711 --> 01:21:51.110
干得好。非常感谢。
Here you go. Thank you.

1336
01:21:51.145 --> 01:21:52.975
你甚至不给自己买辆新卡车？
You won't even buy yourself a new truck?

1337
01:21:53.010 --> 01:21:54.744
不。这个有效。
Nah. This one works.

1338
01:21:54.779 --> 01:21:56.017
是吗？
Does it?

1339
01:21:56.053 --> 01:21:59.154
不是所有的时候。但我想这就是我喜欢它的原因。
Not all the time. But I think that's why I like it.

1340
01:21:59.190 --> 01:22:00.187
隐马尔可夫模型。
Hmm.

1341
01:22:00.951 --> 01:22:02.255
你知道吗？
You know what?

1342
01:22:03.394 --> 01:22:04.719
我确实买了这个。
I did buy this.

1343
01:22:10.664 --> 01:22:16.071
我和你一起数镍币，因为这是我能理解的。
I counted nickels with you because it was something I understood.

1344
01:22:18.140 --> 01:22:21.973
我不知道还有什么更好的方式和你在一起。
I didn't know a better way to spend time with you.

1345
01:22:22.008 --> 01:22:24.013
我只知道我想这么做。
I just knew that I wanted to.

1346
01:22:29.113 --> 01:22:30.680
你知道它是怎么工作的吗？
You know how it works?

1347
01:22:30.715 --> 01:22:35.253
好吧，我假设你创造了旋转，这给了它第三个轴，
Well, I assume you create spin, which gives it a third axis,

1348
01:22:35.288 --> 01:22:38.621
这样风就能抵消重力。
so that the wind can offset the gravity.

1349
01:22:40.225 --> 01:22:42.328
是的，就是这样。就这样。
Yeah, that's it. Just like that.

1350
01:22:44.865 --> 01:22:46.598
想验证这个理论吗？
Wanna test that theory?

1351
01:22:46.634 --> 01:22:47.702
好吧
All right.

1352
01:22:47.738 --> 01:22:49.335
手指放在鞋带上。是 啊
Fingers on the laces. Yeah.

1353
01:22:52.202 --> 01:22:53.676
哦，好吧。不错。
Oh, well. Not bad.

1354
01:22:53.711 --> 01:22:56.540
我会解决的。我知道你会的。
I'll work it out. I know you will.

1355
01:22:57.880 --> 01:23:00.247
哦，就是这样。塞尔比先生？
Oh, that's it. Mr. Selbee?

1356
01:23:01.047 --> 01:23:03.349
玛雅·乔登。波士顿环球报。
Maya Jordon. Boston Globe.

1357
01:23:04.752 --> 01:23:08.552
我想问你一些关于GS投资策略的问题。
I'd like to ask you some questions about GS Investment Strategies.

1358
01:23:10.691 --> 01:23:17.199
那么，你和你妻子在酒店房间里数了11天的票？
So, you and your wife count tickets in a hotel room for 11 days?

1359
01:23:17.235 --> 01:23:18.298
是的。
Yup.

1360
01:23:20.130 --> 01:23:22.764
那工作太多了。
That's so much work.

1361
01:23:24.637 --> 01:23:26.069
嗯。
Mmm.

1362
01:23:26.105 --> 01:23:28.577
这看起来不像是工作。
It doesn't seem like work.

1363
01:23:28.612 --> 01:23:30.640
我一生都在工作。
I've worked all my life.

1364
01:23:31.482 --> 01:23:33.214
这是不同的。
This is different.

1365
01:23:34.651 --> 01:23:36.646
这是非常不同的。
This is very different.

1366
01:23:50.898 --> 01:23:52.767
你送来了吗？
You send it in yet?

1367
01:23:52.802 --> 01:23:54.763
他们帮助了整个城镇。
They helped their entire town.

1368
01:23:55.804 --> 01:23:57.334
问题并不是这个故事。
The flaw isn't the story.

1369
01:23:57.369 --> 01:23:59.537
这可不是吹牛。
Well, this can't be a puff piece.

1370
01:24:00.071 --> 01:24:01.407
我需要一个标题。
I need a headline.

1371
01:24:12.018 --> 01:24:14.523
啊。
Ah.

1372
01:24:14.558 --> 01:24:19.892
嗯，我们在这方面做得很好，我们不再需要比赛了。
well, we do well on this one, we won't need the game anymore.

1373
01:24:19.928 --> 01:24:21.161
我在想，
You know, I was thinking,

1374
01:24:21.196 --> 01:24:23.559
如果我们要为这个镇设立一个基金，
if we're going to have a fund for the town,

1375
01:24:23.594 --> 01:24:25.994
管理它，这将是一份全职工作。
managing it, it's gonna be a full-time job.

1376
01:24:26.029 --> 01:24:27.932
好
Well...

1377
01:24:27.967 --> 01:24:32.772
嘿，你觉得我们可以在市中心找一个像史蒂夫那样的办公室吗？
Hey, you think we can get one of those offices downtown, like Steve's?

1378
01:24:32.807 --> 01:24:34.404
什么
What?

1379
01:24:34.440 --> 01:24:36.403
我已经在他的旁边找到了一个。
I already got us one right next to his.

1380
01:24:36.439 --> 01:24:38.039
是吗？对
You did? Yes!

1381
01:24:38.074 --> 01:24:41.379
事实上，他的轻巡洋舰实际上在我们的一个停车位。
In fact, his Corvette is actually in one of our parking spots.

1382
01:24:41.414 --> 01:24:43.481
好吧，我们必须处理好这件事。
Well, we'll have to take care of that.

1383
01:24:43.517 --> 01:24:46.082
什么他们正在搬出WinFall机器。
What? They're moving out the WinFall machine.

1384
01:24:46.118 --> 01:24:47.585
嘿，嘿！嘿嘿
Hey, hey! Hey. Hey!

1385
01:24:50.090 --> 01:24:54.028
嘿账单比尔，发生什么事了？
Hey. Bill! Bill, what happened?

1386
01:24:54.063 --> 01:24:56.062
彩票吊销了我们的执照。
The lottery suspended our license.

1387
01:24:56.098 --> 01:24:58.233
为什么？你没有看到那篇文章？
Why? You didn't see the article?

1388
01:25:02.440 --> 01:25:03.667
哦
Oh.

1389
01:25:12.080 --> 01:25:14.378
嘿，伙计。学校怎么样？呃，爸爸。
Hey, buddy. How's school? Uh, Dad.

1390
01:25:14.413 --> 01:25:16.449
你在这里干什么？你很有名。
What are you doing here? You're famous.

1391
01:25:18.755 --> 01:25:20.453
太棒了，天才。
Great move, genius.

1392
01:25:20.488 --> 01:25:22.851
走吧。收拾好你的东西。你要回家了。
Let's go. Pack up your stuff. You're coming home.

1393
01:25:24.020 --> 01:25:25.359
现在
Now.

1394
01:25:28.093 --> 01:25:31.060
高容量投注集团发现了游戏中的一个漏洞
The high-volume betting groups discovered a flaw in the game

1395
01:25:31.096 --> 01:25:34.502
并利用了它，达到了数百万美元。
and took advantage of it, to the tune of millions of dollars.

1396
01:25:34.537 --> 01:25:37.232
彩票官员对这一发现表示惊讶
Lottery officials expressed their surprise at the discovery

1397
01:25:37.268 --> 01:25:40.943
并宣布他们将在今晚抽签后逐步淘汰比赛。
and announced they will phase out the game after tonight's drawing.

1398
01:25:40.978 --> 01:25:42.741
继续我们的下一个。。。
Moving on to our next...

1399
01:25:42.776 --> 01:25:46.809
最后一次是今天。你本可以获得最后的胜利。
The last roll down was today. You could've gotten your final win.

1400
01:25:49.382 --> 01:25:53.283
对但即使我们找到了打赌的地方，
Yes. But even if we found a place to bet,

1401
01:25:53.318 --> 01:25:55.455
那感觉就不一样了。
it wouldn't have felt the same.

1402
01:25:59.227 --> 01:26:01.824
对他来说，这不仅仅是一场比赛。
It was more than just a game to him.

1403
01:26:06.600 --> 01:26:09.865
他终于可以利用自己的天赋与人沟通了。
He finally got to use his gift to connect to people.

1404
01:26:20.649 --> 01:26:21.646
杰瑞！
Jerry!

1405
01:26:22.783 --> 01:26:23.745
什么
What?

1406
01:26:23.781 --> 01:26:25.285
股东们今晚要开会
The shareholders are having a meeting tonight

1407
01:26:25.320 --> 01:26:27.887
我想知道你是否可以过来看看。
and were wondering if you could stop by.

1408
01:26:27.922 --> 01:26:29.156
他们不高兴吗？
Are they upset?

1409
01:26:29.192 --> 01:26:31.293
如果我告诉你，你就不会来了。
If I told you that, you wouldn't come.

1410
01:26:34.432 --> 01:26:36.958
我试图在新闻稿中回答他们所有的问题。
I tried to answer all their questions in the newsletter.

1411
01:26:36.993 --> 01:26:39.101
我认为他们不知道如何打开新闻稿。
I don't think they know how to open the newsletter.

1412
01:26:39.136 --> 01:26:41.396
嗯，他们什么都不用担心。
Well, they don't have to worry about anything.

1413
01:26:41.431 --> 01:26:43.272
我们没有违反任何法律。
We didn't break any laws.

1414
01:26:46.537 --> 01:26:50.439
神圣的这是爵士音乐节？什么
Holy... It's jazz fest? What?

1415
01:26:50.474 --> 01:26:52.974
-杰瑞！玛姬！-呵呵。
- Jerry! Marge! - Huh.

1416
01:26:53.914 --> 01:26:55.680
是 啊
Yeah!

1417
01:26:59.250 --> 01:27:00.952
来吧
Come on!

1418
01:27:00.988 --> 01:27:02.489
让我们这样做吧！
Let's do this!

1419
01:27:07.060 --> 01:27:10.093
是 啊好吧，对吧？
Yeah! Okay, right?

1420
01:27:10.129 --> 01:27:12.496
杰尔和玛吉！
Jer and Marge!

1421
01:27:12.531 --> 01:27:16.397
你怎么。。。我们错过了决赛。
How did you... We missed the final play.

1422
01:27:16.433 --> 01:27:17.835
哦，不，我们没有。
Oh, no, we did not.

1423
01:27:17.870 --> 01:27:20.436
是的，每个人都去了商店，爸爸。整个州。
Yeah, everybody took a store, Dad. All across the state.

1424
01:27:20.471 --> 01:27:22.270
我们有一辆公共汽车，什么都有。
We had a bus and everything.

1425
01:27:22.306 --> 01:27:24.044
什么哦
What? Oh.

1426
01:27:24.079 --> 01:27:25.478
你不必那么做。
You didn't have to do that.

1427
01:27:25.514 --> 01:27:27.613
你是为我们做的。我们为什么不为你做呢？
You did it for us. Why wouldn't we do it for you?

1428
01:27:27.648 --> 01:27:30.847
别担心，我们把计数的部分留给你们了。
And don't worry, we left you two the counting part.

1429
01:27:35.757 --> 01:27:37.587
嘿Raj！
Hey, Raj!

1430
01:27:37.622 --> 01:27:39.825
我会帮忙的，但我数不清。
I would help, but, uh, I can't count.

1431
01:27:39.861 --> 01:27:43.665
是的，你可以。我会数数。我只是不喜欢数数。
Yes, you can. I can count. I just don't like to count.

1432
01:27:43.700 --> 01:27:46.795
杰瑞，这个小镇不仅仅是一篇报纸文章。是我们所有人。
This town isn't just a newspaper article, Jerry. It's all of us.

1433
01:27:46.831 --> 01:27:49.166
你让这座城市死而复生
And you brought this town back from the dead

1434
01:27:49.201 --> 01:27:52.737
当没有人能做到的时候，因为你不认为我们只是数字。
when nobody else could, because you don't think we're just numbers.

1435
01:27:55.007 --> 01:27:56.444
不，不。
No. No.

1436
01:27:57.044 --> 01:27:58.380
你是一家人。
You're family.

1437
01:27:59.547 --> 01:28:00.677
女士们、先生们：，
Ladies and gentlemen,

1438
01:28:00.712 --> 01:28:06.319
请为Tori Kelly双手合十！
please put your hands together for Tori Kelly!

1439
01:28:06.354 --> 01:28:11.525
在你之上

1440
01:28:11.561 --> 01:28:16.598
轻声说“我爱你…”
To whisper "I love you..."

1441
01:28:16.634 --> 01:28:17.897
让我们？
Shall we?

1442
01:28:17.933 --> 01:28:19.300
这是爵士音乐节。
It is jazz fest.

1443
01:28:19.335 --> 01:28:21.729
悬铃木
Sycamore tree

1444
01:28:27.838 --> 01:28:32.942
吻我
And kiss me

1445
01:28:32.978 --> 01:28:38.550
告诉我你会想我的
And tell me you'll miss me

1446
01:28:38.586 --> 01:28:43.058
尽可能
As can be

1447
01:28:48.926 --> 01:28:53.996
但我会继续，亲爱的。。。
But I linger on, dear...

1448
01:28:55.170 --> 01:28:57.464
嘿，史蒂夫。嘿，罗达。
Hey, Steve. Hey, Rhoda.

1449
01:28:57.500 --> 01:29:00.370
嘿，你知道，我一直在为你准备吃、祈祷、爱的旅行。
Hey, you know, I've been working on that Eat, Pray, Love trip for you.

1450
01:29:00.405 --> 01:29:01.540
我有一些很好的价格。
I got some great rates.

1451
01:29:01.575 --> 01:29:04.207
哦。那太令人兴奋了。非常感谢。是 啊
Ooh. That's exciting. Thank you. Yeah.

1452
01:29:04.242 --> 01:29:06.145
是的，当然。
Yeah, sure.

1453
01:29:06.181 --> 01:29:09.478
嗯，你想跳舞吗？
Um, do you want to dance?

1454
01:29:09.513 --> 01:29:13.086
嗯，是的。我是说，你呢？
Um, yeah. I mean, do you?

1455
01:29:13.121 --> 01:29:15.356
对这就是我问的原因。
Yes. That's why I asked.

1456
01:29:15.391 --> 01:29:19.560
正当这确实有道理。是 啊
Right. That does make sense. Yeah.

1457
01:29:20.290 --> 01:29:21.461
可以
Okay.

1458
01:29:21.497 --> 01:29:25.827
不管是什么
Whatever they be

1459
01:29:25.862 --> 01:29:30.065
我的。。。
Of me...

1460
01:29:31.675 --> 01:29:34.774
你有多想去数一数那些票？
How badly do you want to go and just count all those tickets?

1461
01:29:34.810 --> 01:29:36.204
嗯。
Mmm.

1462
01:29:36.240 --> 01:29:39.741
我现在不做这件事，这让我很沮丧。
It's taking everything in me not to do it right now.

1463
01:29:39.777 --> 01:29:42.649
我会想念它的。是的，是的。
I'm going to miss it. Yeah, yeah.

1464
01:29:43.918 --> 01:29:45.014
我也是。
Me, too.

1465
01:29:46.984 --> 01:29:50.987
我有点希望我们中了头奖。就一次。
I kinda wish we'd won the jackpot. Just once.

1466
01:29:52.362 --> 01:29:55.627
在我们开始之前我就赢了头奖。
I won the jackpot before we ever started.

1467
01:29:55.663 --> 01:30:01.235
但我还在继续，亲爱的
But I linger on, dear

1468
01:30:05.840 --> 01:30:08.409
Jerry和Marge解散了我们的赌团
 Jerry and Marge dissolved our betting group

1469
01:30:08.444 --> 01:30:11.574
当WinFall游戏被淘汰的时候。
when the WinFall game was phased out.

1470
01:30:11.610 --> 01:30:15.676
他们用大部分彩票中奖来开办建筑贷款业务
They used most of their lottery winnings to start a construction loan business

1471
01:30:15.711 --> 01:30:17.913
为了埃瓦特镇。
for the town of Evart.

1472
01:30:17.949 --> 01:30:19.580
就像他们的许多朋友和邻居一样，
Like many of their friends and neighbors,

1473
01:30:19.615 --> 01:30:23.151
他们还让他们的孩子和孙子孙女完成学业。
they also put their children and grandchildren through school.

1474
01:30:24.286 --> 01:30:28.697
我自己投资了一个非常豪华的男子洞穴。
I myself invested in a very luxurious man cave.

1475
01:30:28.732 --> 01:30:30.094
哇哦！啊！
Whoo! Ah!

1476
01:30:30.130 --> 01:30:33.730
