2
00:00:56,297 --> 00:00:59,884
I knew Harvey Dent, I was his friend.

3
00:01:03,804 --> 00:01:06,556
And it will be a very long time before

4
00:01:06,556 --> 00:01:09,851
someone inspires us the way he did.

5
00:01:12,187 --> 00:01:14,648
I believed in Harvey Dent.

6
00:01:33,124 --> 00:01:37,045
- Dr. Pavel, I'm CIA.
- He wasn't alone.

7
00:01:37,087 --> 00:01:41,382
- You don't get to bring friends.
- They are not my friends.

8
00:01:41,465 --> 00:01:45,052
- Don't worry, no charge for them.
- And why would I want them?

9
00:01:45,094 --> 00:01:47,513
They were trying to up your price.

10
00:01:47,597 --> 00:01:51,601
They work for the mercenary, a masked man.

11
00:01:51,726 --> 00:01:52,810
Bane?

12
00:01:54,812 --> 00:01:56,981
Get them on board. I'll call them in.

13
00:02:05,406 --> 00:02:07,700
The flight plan I just
filed with the agency,

14
00:02:07,784 --> 00:02:10,745
lists me, my man, Dr Pavel here

15
00:02:11,329 --> 00:02:13,164
but only one of you.

16
00:02:17,001 --> 00:02:21,589
The first one to talk gets
to stay on my aircraft.

17
00:02:28,471 --> 00:02:31,349
Who paid you to get Dr. Pavel?

18
00:02:36,936 --> 00:02:41,148
He didn't fly so good,
who wants to try next?

19
00:02:42,316 --> 00:02:46,529
Tell me about Bane! Why
does he wear the mask?

20
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,701
A lot of loyalty for a hired gun!

21
00:02:50,826 --> 00:02:54,120
Or perhaps he's wondering why
someone would shoot a man

22
00:02:54,245 --> 00:02:57,832
before throwing him out of the plane.

23
00:03:01,503 --> 00:03:04,673
At least you can talk. Who are you?

24
00:03:04,756 --> 00:03:07,592
It doesn't matter who we are.

25
00:03:07,634 --> 00:03:09,970
What matters is our plan.

26
00:03:16,017 --> 00:03:20,354
No one cared who I was
til' I put on the mask.

27
00:03:20,897 --> 00:03:25,485
- If I pull that off, will you die?
- It will be extremely painful...

28
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:28,237
- You're a big guy. -... For you.

29
00:03:31,783 --> 00:03:34,285
Was getting caught part of your plan?

30
00:03:34,369 --> 00:03:35,453
Of course.

31
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:44,087
Dr. Pavel refused that
offer in favour of yours.

32
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:45,964
But we have to find out what he told you.

33
00:03:46,006 --> 00:03:48,256
Nothing! I said nothing!

34
00:04:00,936 --> 00:04:04,356
Oh congratulations! You
got yourself caught!

35
00:04:04,356 --> 00:04:05,315
Sir...

36
00:04:05,315 --> 00:04:08,067
Now what's the next step
of your master plan?

37
00:04:08,734 --> 00:04:10,945
Crashing this plane...

38
00:04:15,951 --> 00:04:17,578
with no survivors.

39
00:04:40,183 --> 00:04:41,685
Mayday! Mayday!

40
00:05:48,125 --> 00:05:49,209
No!

41
00:05:49,251 --> 00:05:52,087
They expect one of us in
the wreckage, brother.

42
00:05:53,339 --> 00:05:58,051
- Have we started the fire?
- Yes. The fire rises.

43
00:06:07,185 --> 00:06:10,981
Calm down, doctor. Now is
not the time for fear.

44
00:06:11,522 --> 00:06:13,107
That comes later.

45
00:06:39,591 --> 00:06:43,429
Harvey Dent's day may not be
our oldest public holiday,

46
00:06:43,512 --> 00:06:46,640
but we're here tonight because
it's one the most important.

47
00:06:46,682 --> 00:06:50,811
Harvey Dent's uncompromising
stand against organized crime,

48
00:06:50,853 --> 00:06:54,230
has made Gotham a safer place than
it was at the time of his death,

49
00:06:54,189 --> 00:06:55,106
eight years ago.

50
00:06:55,106 --> 00:06:58,068
This city has seen a historic turn around

51
00:06:58,151 --> 00:07:00,654
No city is without crime, but this city is

52
00:07:00,612 --> 00:07:02,739
without organized crime because the

53
00:07:02,823 --> 00:07:07,328
Dent act gave law enforcement teeth
in its fight against the Mafia.

54
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:10,956
Now people are talking about
repealing the Dent act

55
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:14,334
and to them I say: not on my watch.

56
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:18,380
I want to thank the Wayne
Foundation for hosting this event,

57
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:20,758
and I'm told Mr. Wayne
couldn't be here tonight,

58
00:07:20,841 --> 00:07:22,676
but I'm sure that he's with us in spirit.

59
00:07:22,676 --> 00:07:25,428
And now, I'm going to give
away to an important voice...

60
00:07:25,637 --> 00:07:27,846
Who can lay eyes on Wayne
at one of these sorts?

61
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:29,890
No one has, not in years.

62
00:07:29,973 --> 00:07:34,019
But people put their faith in a
murderous thug in a mask and a cape.

63
00:07:34,061 --> 00:07:37,481
A thug who showed his true nature when

64
00:07:37,481 --> 00:07:43,154
he betrayed the trust of this great
man and murdered him in cold blood.

65
00:07:43,446 --> 00:07:45,823
Sweetheart, not so fast with the chow.

66
00:07:45,823 --> 00:07:46,615
Shrimp balls?

67
00:07:46,699 --> 00:07:49,118
Jim Gordon can tell you the
truth about Harvey Dent.

68
00:07:49,076 --> 00:07:50,077
He get to... Well,

69
00:07:50,161 --> 00:07:53,289
let him tell you himself.
Commissioner Gordon!

70
00:08:02,507 --> 00:08:03,675
The truth...

71
00:08:08,637 --> 00:08:13,934
I have... a speech telling
the truth about Harvey Dent.

72
00:08:21,525 --> 00:08:24,069
Maybe the time isn't right.

73
00:08:27,614 --> 00:08:29,241
Maybe right now...

74
00:08:30,451 --> 00:08:32,537
All you need to know is that...

75
00:08:32,495 --> 00:08:35,872
there are one thousand
inmates in Blackgate Prison

76
00:08:35,956 --> 00:08:38,083
as a direct result of the Dent act.

77
00:08:38,166 --> 00:08:43,045
These are violent criminals essential
thugs in the organized crime machine.

78
00:08:43,045 --> 00:08:48,509
Maybe, for now what I should say about
the death of Harvey Dent is this...

79
00:08:52,138 --> 00:08:54,807
It has not been for nothing.

80
00:08:55,683 --> 00:08:57,352
Did you see the guy who owns the house?

81
00:08:57,352 --> 00:08:59,520
No. You know, I heard he
never leaves the east wing.

82
00:08:59,603 --> 00:09:03,273
You know, I heard he had an accident.
Yeah that he's disfigured...

83
00:09:03,315 --> 00:09:08,571
Mr. Till! Why are your people
using the main staircase?

84
00:09:09,613 --> 00:09:14,077
- And where is Mrs. Bolton?
- She's at the bar, sir. Can I help?

85
00:09:14,494 --> 00:09:15,829
The eastern drawing room.

86
00:09:15,912 --> 00:09:18,205
Unlock the door, put the tray on the table,

87
00:09:18,205 --> 00:09:19,624
lock the door again.

88
00:09:19,707 --> 00:09:20,916
Nothing more.

89
00:09:24,879 --> 00:09:27,632
I'm sorry, Miss Tate. I
tried but he won't see you.

90
00:09:27,673 --> 00:09:29,759
And you know, you mustn't
take it personally.

91
00:09:29,801 --> 00:09:32,512
Everyone knows that Wayne
is hold up in there with

92
00:09:32,595 --> 00:09:35,515
8 inch nails paving into mason jars

93
00:09:35,557 --> 00:09:37,975
It's very good of you
to let me underground.

94
00:09:50,195 --> 00:09:52,989
Why are you wasting your
time trying to talk

95
00:09:52,947 --> 00:09:55,617
to a man who threw away your investment

96
00:09:55,575 --> 00:09:58,370
on some save the world vanity project?

97
00:09:58,453 --> 00:10:00,914
He can't get your money back, I can.

98
00:10:01,039 --> 00:10:04,334
I could try explaining that
the save the world project,

99
00:10:04,459 --> 00:10:08,213
vain or not, is worth
investing in, Mr. Daggett.

100
00:10:08,296 --> 00:10:11,717
But you understand only money and
the power you think it buys.

101
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:14,510
So why waste my time, indeed?

102
00:10:15,261 --> 00:10:16,846
Second shift report's in,

103
00:10:16,929 --> 00:10:19,474
You should spend some
more time with the mayor.

104
00:10:19,432 --> 00:10:21,142
Oh that's your department.

105
00:10:21,434 --> 00:10:23,561
Anyone showed him the crime stats?

106
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:24,687
He goes by his gut,

107
00:10:24,812 --> 00:10:27,190
and it continues to bother him
no matter what the numbers.

108
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:28,483
Must be popular with his wife.

109
00:10:28,566 --> 00:10:31,068
Not really. She took the
kids and left for Cleveland.

110
00:10:31,151 --> 00:10:32,778
We have plenty of time for visits.

111
00:10:32,861 --> 00:10:35,030
The Mayor's gonna dump him in the spring.

112
00:10:35,489 --> 00:10:37,826
Really? But he's a hero.

113
00:10:38,285 --> 00:10:40,871
A war hero. This is peace time.

114
00:11:11,065 --> 00:11:12,191
Sorry sorry.

115
00:11:12,775 --> 00:11:15,611
I'm so terribly sorry, Mr. Wayne!

116
00:11:16,738 --> 00:11:19,240
It is Mr. Wayne, isn't it?

117
00:11:20,034 --> 00:11:25,580
Although you don't have long
nails or facial scars sir...

118
00:11:26,998 --> 00:11:29,584
Is that what they say about me?

119
00:11:29,668 --> 00:11:32,963
It's just that no one ever sees you.

120
00:11:33,004 --> 00:11:34,422
That's a beautiful necklace!

121
00:11:34,422 --> 00:11:36,967
Reminds me of one that
belonged to my mother.

122
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:39,386
It can't be the same one,

123
00:11:40,345 --> 00:11:43,682
because her pearls are in the safe.

124
00:11:44,974 --> 00:11:50,605
The manufacturer clearly explained
that it is uncrackable.

125
00:11:59,405 --> 00:12:02,617
Oups. Nobody told me it was uncrackable.

126
00:12:02,742 --> 00:12:06,079
I'm afraid I can't let you take those.

127
00:12:06,329 --> 00:12:08,415
Look, you wouldn't beat up a woman,

128
00:12:08,373 --> 00:12:10,749
anymore than I would beat up a cripple.

129
00:12:11,417 --> 00:12:14,879
Of course, sometimes
exceptions have to be made.

130
00:12:20,134 --> 00:12:22,344
Good night, Mr. Wayne!

131
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:40,820
- Can I have a ride?
- You read my mind!

132
00:12:40,862 --> 00:12:41,904
Let's go!

133
00:12:42,947 --> 00:12:45,117
Ms. Tate was asking to see you again.

134
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:48,412
- She's very persistent.
- And quite lovely,

135
00:12:48,412 --> 00:12:50,623
- in case you were wondering.
- I wasn't.

136
00:12:50,664 --> 00:12:53,417
- What are you doing?
- Examining print dust.

137
00:12:53,626 --> 00:12:55,169
We've been robbed.

138
00:12:55,252 --> 00:12:58,421
And this your idea of...
sounding the alarm, is it?

139
00:12:58,505 --> 00:13:00,590
She took the pearls,
tracking device and all.

140
00:13:00,674 --> 00:13:02,175
- She?
- One of the maids.

141
00:13:02,259 --> 00:13:04,845
Perhaps you should stop letting
them in this part of the house.

142
00:13:04,886 --> 00:13:07,556
Perhaps you should start
learning to make your own bed.

143
00:13:08,098 --> 00:13:13,437
- Why were you dusting for prints?
- I wasn't. She was.

144
00:13:16,772 --> 00:13:19,609
Sir! The congressman Gilly's
wife has been calling in

145
00:13:19,567 --> 00:13:22,235
apparently the congressman never made

146
00:13:22,235 --> 00:13:24,488
it home after the Wayne Foundation event.

147
00:13:24,571 --> 00:13:26,490
That's a job for the police.

148
00:13:26,531 --> 00:13:29,953
When you and Dent cleaned up the
streets, you cleaned them good.

149
00:13:29,953 --> 00:13:34,289
Pretty soon we will be chasing
down over due library books.

150
00:13:34,706 --> 00:13:39,128
And yet, here you are,
like we're still at war.

151
00:13:40,838 --> 00:13:43,090
- What's your name, son?
- Blake, sir.

152
00:13:43,174 --> 00:13:46,844
You have something you want
to ask me, officer Blake?

153
00:13:47,011 --> 00:13:50,723
It's about that night, this night,
eight years ago, the night Dent died.

154
00:13:50,806 --> 00:13:53,224
The last confirmed sighting of the Batman.

155
00:13:53,266 --> 00:13:55,936
Who murders those people,
takes down two SWAT teams,

156
00:13:56,061 --> 00:14:00,232
brakes Dent's neck and then just vanishes.

157
00:14:00,315 --> 00:14:02,776
I'm not hearing the question.

158
00:14:02,818 --> 00:14:05,320
Don't you want to know who he was?

159
00:14:05,404 --> 00:14:07,864
I know exactly who he was.

160
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:11,326
He was the Batman.

161
00:14:13,996 --> 00:14:17,291
Let's go see about the congressman's wife.

162
00:14:25,424 --> 00:14:26,884
Master Wayne!

163
00:14:28,718 --> 00:14:30,178
Master Wayne!

164
00:15:01,209 --> 00:15:03,378
You haven't been down here in a long time.

165
00:15:03,461 --> 00:15:06,046
I'm trying to find out more
about our jewel thief.

166
00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:07,464
I ran her prints.

167
00:15:07,589 --> 00:15:09,508
Unless she's lost a lot of weight,

168
00:15:09,633 --> 00:15:12,928
she was wearing someone
else's fingerprints.

169
00:15:13,012 --> 00:15:14,180
She's good.

170
00:15:14,263 --> 00:15:17,475
She may be, but we have a
trace on the necklace.

171
00:15:17,558 --> 00:15:20,436
We do, so I cross-referenced
the address she went back to,

172
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:23,314
with police data on I and B and Es,

173
00:15:23,438 --> 00:15:25,190
and Selina Kyle.

174
00:15:26,650 --> 00:15:31,822
Databases are full of close
calls and tips from fencers.

175
00:15:31,863 --> 00:15:35,702
She's good, but the ground is
shrinking beneath her feet.

176
00:15:35,743 --> 00:15:38,454
We should send the police
before she fences the pearls.

177
00:15:38,454 --> 00:15:42,916
She won't. She likes them too much
and they weren't what she was after.

178
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,084
- What was she after?
- My fingerprints.

179
00:15:45,168 --> 00:15:48,254
That was printer toner mixed
with graphite on the safe.

180
00:15:48,338 --> 00:15:50,924
It gives you good pull
and it's untraceable.

181
00:15:51,007 --> 00:15:53,843
Fascinating! You two should
exchange notes over coffee.

182
00:15:53,843 --> 00:15:56,012
So now you're trying to set
me up with a jewel thief?

183
00:15:55,970 --> 00:15:58,056
At this point, I'd set you
up with a chimpanzee,

184
00:15:58,139 --> 00:16:00,808
if it brought you back to the world.

185
00:16:00,891 --> 00:16:04,937
- There's nothing out there for me.
- And that's the problem.

186
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:07,648
You hung up your cape and your
cowl but you didn't move on.

187
00:16:07,690 --> 00:16:10,359
You never went to find a life,
you'll find some how...

188
00:16:10,401 --> 00:16:11,485
Alfred...

189
00:16:12,486 --> 00:16:14,322
I did find someone.

190
00:16:14,572 --> 00:16:18,075
I know, and you lost them but
that's all part of living sir.

191
00:16:18,117 --> 00:16:20,661
But you're not living, you're just waiting,

192
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:22,413
hoping for things to go bad again.

193
00:16:22,413 --> 00:16:23,915
Remember when you left Gotham?

194
00:16:23,998 --> 00:16:26,876
Before all this, before Batman,

195
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,878
You've were gone seven years.

196
00:16:28,962 --> 00:16:33,550
For seven years I've waited, hoping
that you wouldn't come back.

197
00:16:33,591 --> 00:16:35,927
Every year, I took a holiday.

198
00:16:36,052 --> 00:16:39,638
I went to Florence, this...
cafe on the banks of the Arno.

199
00:16:39,722 --> 00:16:43,559
Every fine evening, I would sit
there and order a Fernet Branca.

200
00:16:43,809 --> 00:16:45,978
I had this fantasy..

201
00:16:47,104 --> 00:16:52,568
That I would look across the tables...
and I would see you there...

202
00:16:52,610 --> 00:16:56,237
With a wife maybe a couple of kids.

203
00:16:57,780 --> 00:17:02,577
You wouldn't say anything
to me, nor me to you.

204
00:17:02,953 --> 00:17:09,418
But we would both know that you've
made it, that you were happy.

205
00:17:12,004 --> 00:17:16,382
I never wanted you to come back to Gotham.

206
00:17:16,841 --> 00:17:18,968
I always knew there was nothing

207
00:17:18,968 --> 00:17:21,512
here for you except pain and tragedy

208
00:17:21,596 --> 00:17:25,683
and I wanted something
more for you than that.

209
00:17:29,187 --> 00:17:30,522
I still do.

210
00:17:34,858 --> 00:17:37,570
I wash up here a couple of times a month

211
00:17:37,611 --> 00:17:39,321
and more when it gets colder.

212
00:17:39,405 --> 00:17:41,282
Homeless sheltering in the tunnels.

213
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:47,372
Now we pulled him from the basin but
other than that, we didn't touch him.

214
00:17:49,374 --> 00:17:50,458
What?

215
00:17:50,708 --> 00:17:52,960
His name is Jimmy. He's from St. Swithin's.

216
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:57,090
It's the boy's home reg.
We coached him some ball.

217
00:17:59,801 --> 00:18:01,678
Jimmy had not been around for months.

218
00:18:01,678 --> 00:18:03,555
- No, why?
- Blake, you know why.

219
00:18:03,847 --> 00:18:05,348
He aged out.

220
00:18:05,432 --> 00:18:08,224
We don't have the resources
to keep boys on after 16.

221
00:18:08,307 --> 00:18:10,727
Yeah but I thought the Wayne
Foundation gave money for them.

222
00:18:10,685 --> 00:18:12,312
Not for the past couple of years.

223
00:18:12,395 --> 00:18:16,774
- He has a brother here, doesn't he?
- Mark. I'll tell him.

224
00:18:16,816 --> 00:18:19,652
I'd like to. If that's alright.

225
00:18:20,695 --> 00:18:22,989
You know what he was doing
down there in the tunnels?

226
00:18:23,073 --> 00:18:26,493
A lot of guys would go in down in
the tunnels when they age out.

227
00:18:28,870 --> 00:18:33,500
They say you can live down there.
They say there's work down there.

228
00:18:33,583 --> 00:18:34,584
Work?

229
00:18:35,252 --> 00:18:37,963
What kind of work you're
gonna find in the sewers?

230
00:18:38,046 --> 00:18:41,425
More than you can find up here, I guess.

231
00:18:41,592 --> 00:18:44,386
- So you know about him.
- Of course.

232
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:48,723
Do you think he's coming back?

233
00:18:49,766 --> 00:18:51,392
I don't know...

234
00:19:04,655 --> 00:19:06,448
You brought a date?

235
00:19:06,657 --> 00:19:10,162
I like having someone around
to open doors for me.

236
00:19:10,412 --> 00:19:12,914
Right hand, no partials.

237
00:19:17,544 --> 00:19:18,754
Very nice!

238
00:19:20,796 --> 00:19:25,509
Not so fast, handsome!
You've got something for me?

239
00:19:25,967 --> 00:19:26,968
Oh yes.

240
00:19:36,854 --> 00:19:40,064
I don't know what you're planning
to do with Mr. Wayne's prints,

241
00:19:40,023 --> 00:19:43,526
but I'm guessing you'll need his thumb.

242
00:19:43,818 --> 00:19:47,614
- You don't count so good huh?
- I count fine.

243
00:19:47,655 --> 00:19:51,368
In fact, I'm counting to 10 right now.

244
00:19:53,329 --> 00:19:54,330
Okay...

245
00:19:58,333 --> 00:20:01,419
My friend's outside, just... hit send.

246
00:20:12,681 --> 00:20:17,185
- This place is a little dim.
- It'll lighten up in a minute. Trust me.

247
00:20:18,853 --> 00:20:20,021
Is everything okay?

248
00:20:20,104 --> 00:20:22,398
Great. Catch you later.

249
00:20:28,738 --> 00:20:33,617
It would have been a lot easier
to just give me what we agreed.

250
00:20:33,659 --> 00:20:35,578
We can't have loose ends.

251
00:20:35,744 --> 00:20:40,249
And even in that dress, no
one's going to miss you.

252
00:20:40,332 --> 00:20:43,335
No, but my friend over there,

253
00:20:43,753 --> 00:20:47,089
Every cop in the city is missing him.

254
00:20:47,131 --> 00:20:51,511
That's cute! But they're not gonna
be looking in a place like this.

255
00:20:51,552 --> 00:20:56,014
I don't know, you did
just use his cell phone.

256
00:21:21,582 --> 00:21:23,876
Police! Get down now!

257
00:21:28,214 --> 00:21:29,215
Help me!

258
00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:42,560
Keep some pressure on that, sweetheart.

259
00:21:45,313 --> 00:21:46,355
Call me?

260
00:21:49,399 --> 00:21:52,277
- Careful, Miss.
- He's bleeding! You gotta help him!

261
00:21:56,865 --> 00:21:58,283
I've got the congressman.

262
00:22:26,812 --> 00:22:27,813
There!

263
00:22:32,234 --> 00:22:36,363
The manhole! Get this out.
Get the GWPD down here!

264
00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:38,741
You three, down with me!

265
00:22:38,824 --> 00:22:42,703
You two, you go down, cover the next exit!

266
00:22:58,635 --> 00:23:00,803
What? He went down there?

267
00:23:31,084 --> 00:23:34,421
- We're gonna go down there, right?
- That was a gas explosion, kid.

268
00:23:34,421 --> 00:23:35,463
What gas? It's a sewer.

269
00:23:35,672 --> 00:23:37,840
No one goes in there until
we know what's down there.

270
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,967
We know who's down there sir,
the police commissioner.

271
00:23:39,925 --> 00:23:41,886
Someone get this hot head out of here.

272
00:23:41,886 --> 00:23:44,555
And where's that GWP guy?

273
00:24:26,346 --> 00:24:28,181
Why are you here?

274
00:24:29,724 --> 00:24:30,976
Answer him!

275
00:24:33,102 --> 00:24:34,937
I was asking you.

276
00:24:35,646 --> 00:24:38,316
It's a Police Commissioner.

277
00:24:40,818 --> 00:24:45,281
- And you brought him down here?
- We didn't know what to do.

278
00:24:45,364 --> 00:24:47,033
- We just thought...
- You panicked.

279
00:24:47,158 --> 00:24:49,994
And your weakness just cost
the lives of three others.

280
00:24:50,119 --> 00:24:52,288
No. He's a little...

281
00:24:55,208 --> 00:24:58,711
Search him. Then I will kill you.

282
00:25:27,238 --> 00:25:28,364
He's dead!

283
00:25:28,781 --> 00:25:30,574
So show me his body!

284
00:25:30,658 --> 00:25:32,827
The water runs to any one of the out flows.

285
00:25:32,953 --> 00:25:34,913
We'll never find him.

286
00:25:39,710 --> 00:25:42,463
- Follow him.
- Follow him?

287
00:25:57,727 --> 00:25:59,771
Detective! Detective! Hey! Hey!

288
00:25:59,938 --> 00:26:00,981
You awake?

289
00:26:07,987 --> 00:26:09,363
I need to see Bruce Wayne.

290
00:26:09,447 --> 00:26:12,074
I'm sorry, Mr. Wayne doesn't
take unscheduled calls,

291
00:26:12,116 --> 00:26:14,243
even from a police officer.

292
00:26:14,327 --> 00:26:17,831
If I go get a warrant for the
investigation of Harvey Dent's murder,

293
00:26:17,873 --> 00:26:20,584
it'll still count as an unscheduled?

294
00:26:24,379 --> 00:26:26,839
What can I do for you officer?

295
00:26:26,881 --> 00:26:29,675
Commissioner Gordon has been shot.

296
00:26:31,135 --> 00:26:33,303
He chased the gunmen down into the sewers.

297
00:26:33,387 --> 00:26:36,724
When I pulled him out, he was
babbling about an underground army,

298
00:26:36,807 --> 00:26:39,476
a masked man called Bane.

299
00:26:39,518 --> 00:26:42,228
Well shouldn't you be telling your
superior officers about this?

300
00:26:42,228 --> 00:26:45,148
They asked if he saw any giant alligators.

301
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:46,900
He needs you.

302
00:26:48,610 --> 00:26:50,779
He needs the Batman.

303
00:26:51,655 --> 00:26:53,281
Commissioner Gordon thinks...

304
00:26:53,281 --> 00:26:55,951
Oh he doesn't know or care who you are.

305
00:26:56,034 --> 00:26:58,245
But we've met before.

306
00:26:59,329 --> 00:27:03,959
That was a long time ago, I
was a kid at St. Swithin's...

307
00:27:04,084 --> 00:27:06,420
It used to be funded by
the Wayne Foundation.

308
00:27:06,378 --> 00:27:07,546
It's an orphanage.

309
00:27:08,630 --> 00:27:11,091
My mum died when I was small,
it was a car accident.

310
00:27:11,175 --> 00:27:12,801
I don't remember it.

311
00:27:14,553 --> 00:27:16,639
My dad got shot a couple of years later

312
00:27:16,722 --> 00:27:18,723
for a gambling debt.

313
00:27:18,848 --> 00:27:22,352
Oh I remember that one just fine.

314
00:27:23,228 --> 00:27:30,235
Not a lot of people know what it feels
like to be angry in your bones.

315
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:37,491
I mean they understand.
The fosters parents.

316
00:27:37,450 --> 00:27:39,869
Everybody understands...

317
00:27:39,952 --> 00:27:41,120
for a while.

318
00:27:41,954 --> 00:27:46,375
Then they want the angry little kid
to do something he knows he can't do

319
00:27:46,459 --> 00:27:47,710
move on.

320
00:27:48,336 --> 00:27:50,380
After a while they stop understanding.

321
00:27:50,505 --> 00:27:52,256
They send the angry kid to a boy's home..

322
00:27:52,382 --> 00:27:54,091
I figured it out too late.

323
00:27:54,174 --> 00:28:00,055
Yeah I learned to hide the anger,
and practice smiling in the mirror.

324
00:28:00,681 --> 00:28:03,475
It's like putting on a mask.

325
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:07,354
So you showed up this
one day, in a cool car,

326
00:28:07,313 --> 00:28:09,565
pretty girl on your arm.

327
00:28:09,690 --> 00:28:15,153
We were so excited! Bruce
Wayne, a billionaire orphan?

328
00:28:15,528 --> 00:28:19,032
We used to make up stories
about you man, legends...

329
00:28:19,115 --> 00:28:22,118
and you know with the other kids,
that's all it was, just stories, but...

330
00:28:24,622 --> 00:28:28,251
Right when I saw you, I
knew who you really were.

331
00:28:28,418 --> 00:28:32,087
I'd seen that look on your face before.

332
00:28:32,170 --> 00:28:35,299
It's the same one I taught myself.

333
00:28:36,258 --> 00:28:39,344
I don't why you took the
fault for Dent's murder

334
00:28:39,553 --> 00:28:42,723
but I'm still a believer in the Batman.

335
00:28:42,765 --> 00:28:45,059
Even if you're not...

336
00:28:47,061 --> 00:28:49,479
Why did you say that your boy's home

337
00:28:49,437 --> 00:28:52,272
used to be funded by The Wayne Foundation?

338
00:28:52,314 --> 00:28:54,066
Because the money stopped.

339
00:28:54,149 --> 00:28:56,110
Might be time to get some fresh air

340
00:28:56,110 --> 00:28:58,779
and start paying attention to the details.

341
00:28:59,154 --> 00:29:02,575
Some of those details might need your help.

342
00:29:03,409 --> 00:29:04,869
Have you checked that name, Bane?

343
00:29:04,952 --> 00:29:07,246
He's a mercenary. No, I have no names.

344
00:29:07,329 --> 00:29:10,166
Him and his men man were
behind a coup in West Africa.

345
00:29:10,207 --> 00:29:15,213
They secured mining operations
for our friend, John Daggett.

346
00:29:15,296 --> 00:29:18,132
- And Daggett brought them here.
- So it seems.

347
00:29:20,051 --> 00:29:22,762
- I'll keep digging.
- Yeah.

348
00:29:23,304 --> 00:29:26,056
Alfred, why did the Wayne Foundation

349
00:29:26,014 --> 00:29:29,393
stop funding boy's homes in the city?

350
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:34,982
The foundation is funded by the
profits of Wayne Enterprises.

351
00:29:35,024 --> 00:29:36,817
There have to be some...

352
00:29:36,859 --> 00:29:39,236
Time to talk to Mr. Fox I think.

353
00:29:39,194 --> 00:29:40,988
I'll get him on the phone.

354
00:29:40,988 --> 00:29:44,365
No, no, no. Do we still have
any cars around the place?

355
00:29:44,365 --> 00:29:46,076
Yes, one or two.

356
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:48,578
I need an appointment at
a hospital for my leg.

357
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:52,124
- Which hospital?
- Which ever one Jim Gordon's in.

358
00:29:55,711 --> 00:29:57,922
I have seen worst cartilage in knees.

359
00:29:57,964 --> 00:29:59,090
- It's good.
- No.

360
00:29:59,173 --> 00:30:01,800
That's because there's no
cartilage in your knees

361
00:30:01,758 --> 00:30:04,802
and not much of any use in
your elbows or your shoulders.

362
00:30:04,844 --> 00:30:07,263
Between that and the scar
tissue on your kidney,

363
00:30:07,221 --> 00:30:09,724
residual concussive damage
to your brain tissue

364
00:30:09,807 --> 00:30:12,435
and the general scared
over-quality of your body,

365
00:30:12,435 --> 00:30:14,812
I cannot recommend that you
go heli-skiing, Mr. Wayne.

366
00:30:14,937 --> 00:30:15,980
Right.

367
00:30:30,828 --> 00:30:36,293
We used to be in this together.
They say you were gone.

368
00:30:37,335 --> 00:30:40,629
The Batman wasn't needed anymore. We won...

369
00:30:40,713 --> 00:30:42,548
How strong a lie.

370
00:30:44,008 --> 00:30:49,305
Now this evil rises again
where we tried to bury him.

371
00:30:50,139 --> 00:30:53,142
The Batman has to come back.

372
00:30:54,811 --> 00:30:57,396
What if he doesn't exist anymore?

373
00:30:57,479 --> 00:30:59,147
He must. You...

374
00:31:15,164 --> 00:31:16,581
<i>It's my goddamn wallet, is it?</i>

375
00:31:16,581 --> 00:31:19,376
- You took my wallet!
- No I didn't!

376
00:31:19,668 --> 00:31:22,254
- Get out!
- She took my... Aow!

377
00:31:22,462 --> 00:31:23,546
Now!

378
00:31:24,464 --> 00:31:25,507
Crazy!

379
00:31:25,674 --> 00:31:28,468
I don't know what he's so upset about.
There's only 60 bucks in here.

380
00:31:28,552 --> 00:31:30,679
Care with the watch.

381
00:31:44,567 --> 00:31:45,526
Who's that?

382
00:31:45,526 --> 00:31:48,529
Another stiff, can barely
climb out of his sport car.

383
00:31:48,571 --> 00:31:49,614
Well that's Bruce Wayne!

384
00:31:49,739 --> 00:31:52,282
Mister Wayne, over here!

385
00:31:55,911 --> 00:31:58,540
- I'm not sure if my assistant...
- Right through here, Mr. Wayne.

386
00:31:58,581 --> 00:32:00,417
Thank you so much.

387
00:32:04,713 --> 00:32:07,841
Bruce Wayne at a charity ball?

388
00:32:09,551 --> 00:32:11,677
Ms. Tate, isn't it?

389
00:32:12,178 --> 00:32:15,765
Even before you became a recluse,
you never came to these things

390
00:32:15,806 --> 00:32:18,017
Proceeds go to big fat spread.

391
00:32:18,017 --> 00:32:19,060
It is not about charity,

392
00:32:19,227 --> 00:32:23,898
It's about feeding the ego which
ever society hag laid this on.

393
00:32:23,981 --> 00:32:26,734
Actually this is my party, Mr. Wayne.

394
00:32:28,442 --> 00:32:30,611
And the proceeds will go where they should,

395
00:32:30,653 --> 00:32:34,115
because I paid for the
big fat spread myself.

396
00:32:34,282 --> 00:32:35,742
It's very generous of you.

397
00:32:35,825 --> 00:32:39,162
You have to invest if you want
to restore balance to the world.

398
00:32:39,788 --> 00:32:41,999
Take our clean energy project.

399
00:32:42,082 --> 00:32:44,752
Sometimes, the investment doesn't pay off.

400
00:32:45,085 --> 00:32:46,252
I'm sorry.

401
00:32:46,419 --> 00:32:49,005
You have a practiced apathy, Mr. Wayne.

402
00:32:49,172 --> 00:32:52,342
But a man who doesn't care about the
world doesn't spend half his fortune

403
00:32:52,384 --> 00:32:54,553
on a plan to save it.

404
00:32:54,970 --> 00:33:01,017
And isn't so wounded when it
fails that he goes into hiding.

405
00:33:01,727 --> 00:33:04,354
Have a good evening, Mr. Wayne!

406
00:33:07,690 --> 00:33:09,609
Mind if I cut in?

407
00:33:10,401 --> 00:33:11,611
Thank you.

408
00:33:14,655 --> 00:33:16,574
You're don't seem happy to see me.

409
00:33:16,658 --> 00:33:20,119
- You were supposed to be a shut-in.
- I felt like some fresh air.

410
00:33:20,203 --> 00:33:22,872
Why didn't you call the police?

411
00:33:22,956 --> 00:33:26,209
I have a powerful friend who
deals with things like these.

412
00:33:26,292 --> 00:33:30,547
It's a brazing costume for a cat burglar.

413
00:33:31,089 --> 00:33:36,219
- Yeah? Who are you pretending to be?
- Bruce Wayne, eccentric billionaire.

414
00:33:36,803 --> 00:33:39,388
- Who's your date?
- His wife's in Ibiza.

415
00:33:39,472 --> 00:33:43,266
She left her diamonds behind though,
worried it might get stolen.

416
00:33:43,516 --> 00:33:45,560
It pronounced 'Ibitha'.

417
00:33:45,727 --> 00:33:48,980
You wouldn't want any of these
folks realizing you're a crook,

418
00:33:48,939 --> 00:33:49,981
not a social climber.

419
00:33:50,065 --> 00:33:53,568
You think I care what anyone
in this room thinks of me?

420
00:33:54,319 --> 00:33:57,155
I doubt you care what anyone
in any room thinks of you.

421
00:33:57,197 --> 00:34:01,075
Don't condescend, Mr. Wayne. You
don't know a thing about me.

422
00:34:01,158 --> 00:34:02,994
Well Selina Kyle.

423
00:34:03,494 --> 00:34:05,664
I know you came here from
your woke-up and old Town,

424
00:34:05,748 --> 00:34:07,583
a modest place for a master jewel thief.

425
00:34:07,666 --> 00:34:09,835
Which means that either you're
saving for retirement or

426
00:34:09,918 --> 00:34:13,756
you're in deep with the wrong people.

427
00:34:15,090 --> 00:34:17,134
You don't get to judge me just because you

428
00:34:17,134 --> 00:34:19,344
were born in the master
bedroom of Wayne...

429
00:34:19,427 --> 00:34:21,054
Actually, I was born in the Regency room.

430
00:34:21,137 --> 00:34:23,431
I started out doing what I had to.

431
00:34:24,724 --> 00:34:26,226
Once you've done what you had to,

432
00:34:26,226 --> 00:34:28,103
they never let you do what you want to.

433
00:34:28,186 --> 00:34:29,479
Start fresh.

434
00:34:29,938 --> 00:34:32,899
There's no fresh start in today's world.

435
00:34:32,941 --> 00:34:35,861
Any 12 year-old with a cell phone
would find out what you did.

436
00:34:35,943 --> 00:34:40,072
Everything we do is collated and
quantified, everything sticks.

437
00:34:40,114 --> 00:34:42,658
Is that how you justify stealing?

438
00:34:42,742 --> 00:34:45,328
I take what I need from those
who have more than enough.

439
00:34:45,411 --> 00:34:47,664
I don't stand on the shoulders
of the people with less.

440
00:34:47,664 --> 00:34:48,707
Robin Hood?

441
00:34:48,874 --> 00:34:51,793
I think I do more to help someone
than most of the people in this room.

442
00:34:51,834 --> 00:34:53,419
Thank you.

443
00:34:54,212 --> 00:34:56,171
I think maybe you're
assuming a little too much.

444
00:34:56,171 --> 00:34:58,549
Maybe you're being unrealistic about what's

445
00:34:58,549 --> 00:35:00,759
really in your pants
other than your wallet.

446
00:35:00,759 --> 00:35:01,302
Ouch.

447
00:35:01,802 --> 00:35:03,888
You think all this can last?

448
00:35:03,971 --> 00:35:06,849
There's a storm coming, Mr. Wayne.

449
00:35:07,433 --> 00:35:10,227
You and your friends better
batten down the hatches,

450
00:35:10,311 --> 00:35:12,604
because when it hits,
you're all going to wonder

451
00:35:12,812 --> 00:35:16,232
how you ever thought you
could live so large

452
00:35:16,232 --> 00:35:19,236
and leave so little for the rest of us.

453
00:35:22,197 --> 00:35:25,492
You sound like you're
looking forward to it.

454
00:35:26,076 --> 00:35:27,744
I'm adaptable.

455
00:35:27,828 --> 00:35:30,540
Those pearls do look better on
you than they did in my safe,

456
00:35:31,748 --> 00:35:34,501
but I still can't let you keep them.

457
00:35:41,091 --> 00:35:44,220
You scared her off!

458
00:35:46,514 --> 00:35:48,682
Not likely...

459
00:35:50,225 --> 00:35:51,643
I still lost my ticket.

460
00:35:51,768 --> 00:35:53,853
Your wife said you were taking a cab home.

461
00:35:53,812 --> 00:35:54,354
My wife?

462
00:36:02,153 --> 00:36:04,530
Just you, sir?

463
00:36:06,824 --> 00:36:09,492
Don't worry, Master Wayne.

464
00:36:09,534 --> 00:36:12,704
It takes a little time to get
back in the swing of things.

465
00:36:14,791 --> 00:36:18,586
Bruce Wayne! Design, live and breathe

466
00:36:19,712 --> 00:36:22,465
What brings you out of the
prior sleep, Mr. Wayne?

467
00:36:22,549 --> 00:36:24,342
I see you haven't lost your sense of humor,

468
00:36:24,342 --> 00:36:26,635
even if you have lost most of my money.

469
00:36:26,635 --> 00:36:28,303
Actually you did that.

470
00:36:28,387 --> 00:36:31,223
If you file your entire Rn'D budget

471
00:36:31,181 --> 00:36:34,184
into a fusion project
that you get mock ball,

472
00:36:34,226 --> 00:36:36,270
your company is unlikely to thrive.

473
00:36:36,437 --> 00:36:37,980
What are my options?

474
00:36:38,063 --> 00:36:40,316
Well if you're unwilling
to turn on the machine,

475
00:36:40,399 --> 00:36:42,943
I can't. I can't, Lucius.

476
00:36:43,027 --> 00:36:45,028
Well then sit tight.

477
00:36:45,111 --> 00:36:46,947
Your majority keep Daggett at bay

478
00:36:47,030 --> 00:36:51,409
while we figure out a future for the
energy program with Miranda Tate.

479
00:36:51,451 --> 00:36:54,287
She has supported the project all the way.

480
00:36:54,371 --> 00:36:57,792
She's smart and quite lovely.

481
00:36:58,501 --> 00:37:02,005
We all just want what's
the best for you, Bruce.

482
00:37:02,088 --> 00:37:06,341
- Show her the machine.
- I'll think it over.

483
00:37:06,425 --> 00:37:10,220
- Anything else?
- Nope. Why?

484
00:37:10,262 --> 00:37:14,641
Well these conversation used to
end with an unusual request.

485
00:37:14,974 --> 00:37:16,935
I retired.

486
00:37:18,228 --> 00:37:20,896
Well, let me show you some stuff, anyway.

487
00:37:24,692 --> 00:37:26,777
Just for old times' sake.

488
00:37:30,322 --> 00:37:32,742
I figured you had to shut this place down.

489
00:37:32,742 --> 00:37:35,369
Oh, it was always shut down. Officially.

490
00:37:35,369 --> 00:37:36,871
What's the new stuff...

491
00:37:36,954 --> 00:37:39,165
After your father died, Wayne Enterprises

492
00:37:39,165 --> 00:37:41,626
has set up 14 different
defense subsidiaries.

493
00:37:41,709 --> 00:37:44,170
For years, I've been
shuttering and consolidating

494
00:37:44,128 --> 00:37:46,339
all the different
prototypes under one roof.

495
00:37:46,464 --> 00:37:48,424
- My roof.
- Why?

496
00:37:48,508 --> 00:37:51,344
To keep them from falling
into the wrong hands.

497
00:37:54,430 --> 00:37:57,016
Oh now you're just showing off.

498
00:37:57,850 --> 00:37:59,518
Defense department project.

499
00:37:59,643 --> 00:38:02,980
Tight Geometer Urban Pacification.

500
00:38:03,063 --> 00:38:05,441
Rotors are configured to
maneuver between buildings

501
00:38:05,524 --> 00:38:07,902
without recirculation.

502
00:38:08,027 --> 00:38:09,987
What's it called?

503
00:38:10,154 --> 00:38:14,492
It has a long uninteresting
Wayne Enterprise's designation.

504
00:38:14,533 --> 00:38:17,994
I just the took to calling it the Bat.

505
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:21,833
And yes Mr. Wayne, it does come in black.

506
00:38:23,084 --> 00:38:26,420
Works fine, apart the autopilot.

507
00:38:26,461 --> 00:38:28,588
Takes a better mind than mine to fix it.

508
00:38:28,630 --> 00:38:30,173
A better mind?

509
00:38:30,591 --> 00:38:33,510
Well I was trying to be modest.

510
00:38:33,759 --> 00:38:37,555
A less busy mind. Yours.

511
00:38:44,771 --> 00:38:46,397
It should be a bit painful.

512
00:38:46,481 --> 00:38:48,149
You'll be very welcome to try, Alfred.

513
00:38:48,233 --> 00:38:51,236
Happy watching. Thank you, sir.

514
00:38:53,529 --> 00:38:55,239
Not so bad...

515
00:38:59,535 --> 00:39:01,745
Not bad at all!

516
00:39:04,374 --> 00:39:07,794
If you're seriously considering
going back out there,

517
00:39:07,878 --> 00:39:10,255
you should hear the
rumors surrounding Bane.

518
00:39:10,339 --> 00:39:12,048
I'm all ears.

519
00:39:12,215 --> 00:39:15,426
There is a prison in a more
ancient part of the world.

520
00:39:15,593 --> 00:39:21,474
A pit where men are
thrown to suffer and die.

521
00:39:21,516 --> 00:39:25,311
But sometimes a man rises
from the darkness.

522
00:39:25,395 --> 00:39:29,481
Sometimes, the pit sends something back.

523
00:39:29,565 --> 00:39:31,942
- Bane!
- Right.

524
00:39:32,026 --> 00:39:34,945
Born and raised in hell on earth.

525
00:39:35,112 --> 00:39:36,113
Born in a prison?

526
00:39:36,196 --> 00:39:38,907
No one knows why or how he escaped.

527
00:39:38,948 --> 00:39:45,955
But they do know that once he did, he was
trained by Ra's Al Ghul, your mentor.

528
00:39:45,997 --> 00:39:48,458
Bane was a member of the League of Shadows.

529
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:50,794
And then he was excommunicated.

530
00:39:50,877 --> 00:39:54,673
And any man who is too
extreme for Ra's Al Ghul,

531
00:39:54,673 --> 00:39:56,842
is not to be trifled with.

532
00:39:56,925 --> 00:40:00,637
I didn't realize I was known
for trifling with criminals.

533
00:40:00,679 --> 00:40:02,222
That was then.

534
00:40:02,306 --> 00:40:05,600
Then you can just strap up your
leg and put your mask back on,

535
00:40:05,641 --> 00:40:07,727
but that doesn't make you what you were.

536
00:40:07,810 --> 00:40:12,857
If this man is everything that you
say he is, then the city needs me.

537
00:40:12,899 --> 00:40:18,112
The city needs Bruce Wayne,
your resources, your knowledge.

538
00:40:18,071 --> 00:40:21,199
It doesn't need your body or your life.

539
00:40:21,783 --> 00:40:23,284
That time is past.

540
00:40:23,368 --> 00:40:26,537
You're afraid that if I go
back out there, I'll fail.

541
00:40:26,578 --> 00:40:28,372
No.

542
00:40:29,499 --> 00:40:33,754
I'm afraid that you want to.

543
00:40:46,682 --> 00:40:50,102
You can't short the stock because
Bruce Wayne goes to a party.

544
00:40:50,143 --> 00:40:51,520
Wayne coming back is change.

545
00:40:51,645 --> 00:40:54,231
- Change, is it good or bad?
- Oh, bad.

546
00:40:54,273 --> 00:40:57,234
- On what basis?
- I flip the coin.

547
00:41:03,323 --> 00:41:05,408
I said no rye, man.

548
00:41:08,036 --> 00:41:11,539
Rookie! Loose the helmet!
We need faces for camera.

549
00:41:16,462 --> 00:41:18,672
Come on let's go scalping.

550
00:42:19,439 --> 00:42:22,317
This is a stock exchange.
There's no money you can steal.

551
00:42:22,442 --> 00:42:25,988
Really? Then why are you people here?

552
00:42:49,845 --> 00:42:51,638
You've got to get in there!

553
00:42:51,721 --> 00:42:54,724
- This is a hostage situation.
- No! No, no, this is a robbery!

554
00:42:54,808 --> 00:42:57,018
They have direct access to
the online trading desk.

555
00:42:57,102 --> 00:42:59,521
I'm not risking my men for your money.

556
00:43:02,858 --> 00:43:05,235
Sir, we're gonna ask you to move.
We have a situation here.

557
00:43:05,319 --> 00:43:07,404
It's not our money, it's everybody's.

558
00:43:07,488 --> 00:43:09,655
Really? Mine is in my mattress.

559
00:43:09,739 --> 00:43:11,032
If don't put these guys down,

560
00:43:11,115 --> 00:43:14,493
that stuffing in your mattress might
be worth a whole hell of a lot less.

561
00:43:14,534 --> 00:43:16,870
Cut the fiber cable and
take out that cell tower.

562
00:43:16,912 --> 00:43:19,039
- Thank you.
- That will slow them down.

563
00:43:25,296 --> 00:43:26,714
They cut the fiber.

564
00:43:27,965 --> 00:43:31,135
- The cell's working.
- For now.

565
00:43:36,307 --> 00:43:37,308
Get all this barriers up.

566
00:43:37,308 --> 00:43:38,351
I want all of them up.

567
00:43:38,351 --> 00:43:40,186
No one gets in or out of
any of these streets.

568
00:43:40,227 --> 00:43:43,272
- Where am I suppose to move it?
- Back it up.

569
00:43:47,359 --> 00:43:49,653
Just stay in your vehicle, okay?

570
00:43:56,201 --> 00:43:59,455
How much longer does the program need?

571
00:44:00,205 --> 00:44:02,207
Eight minutes.

572
00:44:02,876 --> 00:44:04,460
Time to go. Move out.

573
00:44:04,501 --> 00:44:06,003
Everybody up!

574
00:44:09,882 --> 00:44:11,509
You two, move!

575
00:44:13,761 --> 00:44:15,721
Thank you.

576
00:44:16,097 --> 00:44:17,390
Steady!

577
00:44:25,813 --> 00:44:27,648
Steady!

578
00:44:35,615 --> 00:44:37,200
I've got something!

579
00:44:37,408 --> 00:44:39,910
Hold your fire! They have hostages!

580
00:44:40,035 --> 00:44:41,536
Hold your fire!

581
00:44:51,089 --> 00:44:52,549
Go! Go!

582
00:45:02,433 --> 00:45:04,810
Please, let me go!

583
00:45:04,935 --> 00:45:08,147
Please! Hey!

584
00:45:09,899 --> 00:45:12,944
- Shoot the tires!
- There's no shot.

585
00:45:14,195 --> 00:45:17,405
Now back off! Back off!
They've got hostages!

586
00:45:17,447 --> 00:45:19,533
<i>Police are pursuing the 4 suspects from</i>

587
00:45:19,491 --> 00:45:21,660
<i>downtown in respond to a hostage situation</i>

588
00:45:21,743 --> 00:45:22,869
Gotham PD...

589
00:45:28,877 --> 00:45:30,753
What's going on with the lights?

590
00:45:37,550 --> 00:45:39,344
I can't pick up anything!

591
00:45:39,469 --> 00:45:40,470
Who the hell was that?

592
00:45:40,595 --> 00:45:43,890
Oh boy you are in for a show tonight, son!

593
00:45:48,770 --> 00:45:50,814
Please! Help!

594
00:46:08,664 --> 00:46:10,166
Sorry!

595
00:46:10,249 --> 00:46:12,752
Put that thing away
before you hurt yourself.

596
00:46:12,835 --> 00:46:13,336
Get in!

597
00:46:13,336 --> 00:46:15,338
Let's go. You, get in the car!

598
00:46:15,421 --> 00:46:17,298
We've spotted the Batman!

599
00:46:27,767 --> 00:46:28,768
All everyone in.

600
00:46:28,893 --> 00:46:31,061
Every car patrol, beat
cop and off duty too.

601
00:46:31,145 --> 00:46:32,354
Call them in now!

602
00:46:32,438 --> 00:46:34,231
I'm going to do what Jim
Gordon never could.

603
00:46:34,231 --> 00:46:37,026
- What's that?
- I'm going to take down the Batman.

604
00:46:38,361 --> 00:46:40,363
<i>..The 4 suspect are carrying two hostages</i>

605
00:46:40,404 --> 00:46:42,531
<i>that they kidnapped at the
Gotham Stock Exchange.</i>

606
00:46:42,615 --> 00:46:44,283
<i>Witnesses reported that...</i>

607
00:46:47,077 --> 00:46:48,494
<i>It seems hard to believe.</i>

608
00:46:48,494 --> 00:46:51,205
<i>But report suspects are now being pursued,</i>

609
00:46:51,205 --> 00:46:53,040
<i>what appears to be, the Batman.</i>

610
00:46:53,166 --> 00:46:55,335
Well what do you know..

611
00:46:59,715 --> 00:47:02,885
Sir, what about the armed robbers?

612
00:47:04,053 --> 00:47:07,722
Please! Let me go! Please!

613
00:47:16,564 --> 00:47:17,649
<i>One bike has pulled off.</i>

614
00:47:17,732 --> 00:47:19,734
<i>No hostage. Shall we pursue?</i>

615
00:47:24,697 --> 00:47:26,740
Negative. Stay on the Batman!

616
00:47:28,909 --> 00:47:30,953
- He's getting away.
- Who do you want to catch huh?

617
00:47:31,037 --> 00:47:33,748
Some robber or the son-of-a-bitch
who killed Harvey Dent?

618
00:47:42,590 --> 00:47:45,760
Eight years and he has to pick tonight.

619
00:47:45,718 --> 00:47:48,263
He's drawing the cops off Bane.

620
00:47:56,396 --> 00:48:00,566
Please! Let me go! Please!

621
00:48:33,682 --> 00:48:36,018
TRANSFERRING COMPLETE

622
00:49:17,516 --> 00:49:18,809
<i>We lost him.</i>

623
00:49:18,892 --> 00:49:20,727
How could you lose him?

624
00:49:20,853 --> 00:49:22,229
<i>He's got a lot of firepower.</i>

625
00:49:22,354 --> 00:49:24,523
And what? Then you don't?

626
00:49:28,485 --> 00:49:30,404
<i>He heads back downtown.</i>

627
00:49:30,446 --> 00:49:32,363
Then he's as dumb as he dresses.

628
00:49:32,447 --> 00:49:34,407
Close it up, gentlemen!

629
00:50:06,565 --> 00:50:09,233
Like a rat in a trap, gentlemen!

630
00:50:14,113 --> 00:50:17,575
You might have the wrong animal there, sir!

631
00:50:27,835 --> 00:50:29,837
Sure it was him!

632
00:50:36,177 --> 00:50:39,722
<i>Bane says that Batman interfered,
but the task was accomplished.</i>

633
00:50:39,806 --> 00:50:41,474
And what about the men they've arrested?

634
00:50:41,557 --> 00:50:46,228
He said and I quote: ' They
would die before talking. '

635
00:50:46,937 --> 00:50:49,690
Where does he find these guys?

636
00:50:50,774 --> 00:50:52,776
Open the champagne!

637
00:50:54,570 --> 00:50:59,033
- And can we get some girls in here?
- Be careful what you wish for!

638
00:51:09,335 --> 00:51:12,254
- The Cat got your tongue?
- You dumb bitch!

639
00:51:12,338 --> 00:51:14,465
Nobody ever accused me of being dumb.

640
00:51:14,548 --> 00:51:18,094
You're dumb, for coming here tonight.

641
00:51:18,469 --> 00:51:21,722
I want what you owe me.

642
00:51:22,305 --> 00:51:26,435
- One doesn't get...
- Nice outfit!

643
00:51:26,476 --> 00:51:28,478
Those heels, they may be tough to walk?

644
00:51:28,562 --> 00:51:32,357
I don't know, do you think?

645
00:51:33,357 --> 00:51:34,984
- So where is it?
- Where's what?

646
00:51:35,068 --> 00:51:37,445
The program ' The Clean Slate '.

647
00:51:37,570 --> 00:51:40,989
The Ultimate Tool for a
master thief with a record.

648
00:51:41,573 --> 00:51:43,075
Hold it right there!

649
00:51:56,464 --> 00:51:59,884
- Where is it?!
- ' The Clean Slate? '

650
00:51:59,925 --> 00:52:01,886
Where you type in someone's
name, date of birth

651
00:52:01,927 --> 00:52:06,349
and in a few minutes they're gone
from every database on earth.

652
00:52:06,474 --> 00:52:08,976
Sounds a little too good to be true?

653
00:52:09,060 --> 00:52:12,939
You're lying! RIKEN DATA
took it to prototype stage.

654
00:52:13,022 --> 00:52:15,108
That's why I bought them.

655
00:52:15,233 --> 00:52:20,320
But they had nothing. It
was a gang-lying myth.

656
00:52:31,081 --> 00:52:32,791
Stay back!

657
00:52:35,544 --> 00:52:37,505
I'm not bluffing!

658
00:52:38,088 --> 00:52:41,717
They know! They just don't care.

659
00:52:58,649 --> 00:53:01,235
- You've got to be kidding me.
- No guns, no killing.

660
00:53:01,277 --> 00:53:02,820
Where's the fun in that?

661
00:53:21,339 --> 00:53:23,758
My mother warned me about getting
into cars with strange men.

662
00:53:23,842 --> 00:53:25,927
This isn't a car.

663
00:54:14,975 --> 00:54:16,601
See you around!

664
00:54:17,394 --> 00:54:18,895
You're welcome!

665
00:54:18,979 --> 00:54:21,982
- I had it under control.
- Those weren't street thugs.

666
00:54:22,107 --> 00:54:25,609
They were trained killers.
I saved your life.

667
00:54:25,735 --> 00:54:30,364
In return, I need to know what you
did with Bruce Wayne's fingerprints.

668
00:54:30,406 --> 00:54:33,826
Wayne wasn't kidding
about a powerful friend.

669
00:54:33,910 --> 00:54:36,913
I sold his prints to Daggett.

670
00:54:37,080 --> 00:54:40,750
For something that doesn't even exist.

671
00:54:41,084 --> 00:54:43,003
I doubt that it will get the better of you.

672
00:54:43,128 --> 00:54:46,172
- Hey when a girl's desperate...
- What's he going to do with them?

673
00:54:46,256 --> 00:54:48,133
I don't know but Daggett seemed pretty

674
00:54:48,091 --> 00:54:50,468
interested in that mess
at the stock market.

675
00:54:55,932 --> 00:54:57,934
Miss Kyle...

676
00:55:00,187 --> 00:55:02,855
So that's what that feels like...

677
00:55:21,539 --> 00:55:23,541
I've seen you in the television coverage,

678
00:55:23,541 --> 00:55:26,211
and you've got your taste for
want and destruction back.

679
00:55:26,295 --> 00:55:27,963
There are 3 disks.

680
00:55:28,380 --> 00:55:30,883
Aren't the police supposed
to be investigating them?

681
00:55:30,966 --> 00:55:32,760
They don't have the tools to analyze it.

682
00:55:32,926 --> 00:55:34,428
They would if you gave them to them.

683
00:55:34,511 --> 00:55:37,139
One man's tool is another man's weapon.

684
00:55:37,181 --> 00:55:38,264
In your mind perhaps, well

685
00:55:38,264 --> 00:55:40,391
there aren't many things you
can't turn into a weapon.

686
00:55:40,475 --> 00:55:42,477
Alfred, enough! The police
weren't getting it done.

687
00:55:42,560 --> 00:55:45,772
Perhaps they might have. If you
hadn't made a side show of yourself.

688
00:55:45,939 --> 00:55:47,315
You thought I didn't have it in me.

689
00:55:47,399 --> 00:55:49,609
You don't! You led a bluntly
police force, a merry chase

690
00:55:49,693 --> 00:55:52,904
with a load of fancy new toys from Fox.

691
00:55:52,946 --> 00:55:54,656
What about when you come up against him?

692
00:55:54,740 --> 00:55:55,824
What then?

693
00:55:55,907 --> 00:55:57,325
I'll fight harder. I always have.

694
00:55:57,325 --> 00:56:00,786
Take a look, his speed, his
ferocity, his training.

695
00:56:00,953 --> 00:56:03,456
I see the power of belief.

696
00:56:03,539 --> 00:56:06,626
I see the League of Shadows resurgent.

697
00:56:06,709 --> 00:56:10,297
- You said he was excommunicated.
- By Ra's Al Ghul.

698
00:56:10,381 --> 00:56:12,549
Who leads them now?

699
00:56:12,633 --> 00:56:14,926
Ra's Al Ghul was the League
of Shadows and I beat him.

700
00:56:15,009 --> 00:56:17,804
Bane is just a mercenary. We need
to find out what he's up to.

701
00:56:19,139 --> 00:56:22,433
Trades of some kind. Coded.

702
00:56:22,516 --> 00:56:25,436
And my fingerprints
courtesy of Selina Kyle.

703
00:56:25,477 --> 00:56:26,520
Give this to Fox.

704
00:56:26,604 --> 00:56:27,980
He can crack the code

705
00:56:27,980 --> 00:56:31,025
and tell us what trades
they were executing.

706
00:56:34,694 --> 00:56:38,281
I'll give this to Mr. Fox but no more.

707
00:56:39,866 --> 00:56:43,662
I've sewn you up, I've set your
bones, but I won't bury you.

708
00:56:43,703 --> 00:56:47,666
I've buried enough members
in the Wayne family.

709
00:56:47,749 --> 00:56:48,834
You leave me?

710
00:56:48,917 --> 00:56:52,838
You seek only one end to your journey.

711
00:56:53,213 --> 00:56:57,760
Leaving is all I have
to make you understand.

712
00:56:57,968 --> 00:57:01,555
You're not Batman anymore. You
have to find another way.

713
00:57:01,638 --> 00:57:06,060
You used to talk about finishing,
about a light beyond that awful cave.

714
00:57:06,101 --> 00:57:09,688
Alfred, Rachel died knowing that
we had decided to be together.

715
00:57:09,729 --> 00:57:11,398
That was my life, beyond the cave.

716
00:57:11,439 --> 00:57:14,025
I can't just move on.

717
00:57:14,109 --> 00:57:17,654
She... She didn't, she couldn't.

718
00:57:17,654 --> 00:57:20,866
- What if she had?
- She didn't and I can't change that.

719
00:57:20,949 --> 00:57:23,994
What if, before she died,
she wrote a letter

720
00:57:24,035 --> 00:57:28,456
saying she chose Harvey Dent over you?

721
00:57:31,625 --> 00:57:36,422
And what if, to spare you pain...

722
00:57:37,673 --> 00:57:40,510
I burnt that letter ...?

723
00:57:40,718 --> 00:57:44,931
How dare you use Rachel to try and stop me.

724
00:57:44,973 --> 00:57:48,142
I am using the truth, Master Wayne.

725
00:57:48,851 --> 00:57:51,437
Maybe it's time we all stop
trying to outsmart the truth

726
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:54,940
and let it have his day.

727
00:57:55,149 --> 00:57:57,401
- I'm sorry.
- You're sorry?

728
00:57:57,484 --> 00:58:00,946
You expect to destroy my world...

729
00:58:02,281 --> 00:58:05,408
and then think that
we're gonna shake hands?

730
00:58:05,450 --> 00:58:07,452
No.

731
00:58:07,577 --> 00:58:11,456
- I know what this means.
- What does it mean?

732
00:58:11,498 --> 00:58:16,170
It means you're hatred, and
it also means losing someone,

733
00:58:16,129 --> 00:58:19,465
who I've cared for since I first heard

734
00:58:19,549 --> 00:58:25,220
his cries echoing through this house.

735
00:58:25,387 --> 00:58:30,517
But it might also mean saving your life.

736
00:58:30,726 --> 00:58:34,438
And that is more important.

737
00:58:38,317 --> 00:58:40,820
Goodbye, Alfred!

738
00:58:59,087 --> 00:59:01,505
Alfred?

739
00:59:05,301 --> 00:59:07,762
- Answering your own door?
- Yeah.

740
00:59:09,180 --> 00:59:10,973
Page three.

741
00:59:11,057 --> 00:59:15,228
Seems you made a series of laud to
put options on the future exchange.

742
00:59:15,311 --> 00:59:16,813
Verified by thumb print.

743
00:59:16,938 --> 00:59:19,398
Those options expired
at midnight last night.

744
00:59:19,481 --> 00:59:22,776
Long term we may be able to
prove fraud but for now,

745
00:59:22,735 --> 00:59:24,194
you're completely broke.

746
00:59:24,320 --> 00:59:28,032
And Wayne Enterprises is about to
fall into the hands of John Daggett.

747
00:59:28,157 --> 00:59:29,575
The weapons...

748
00:59:29,658 --> 00:59:32,036
We can't let Daggett get his
hands on Applied Sciences.

749
00:59:32,119 --> 00:59:35,164
Applied Sciences is all
locked up and off the books.

750
00:59:35,247 --> 00:59:38,333
The energy project however,
it's a different story.

751
00:59:38,375 --> 00:59:40,210
Miranda Tate...

752
00:59:40,961 --> 00:59:42,964
We need to convince the
board to get behind her.

753
00:59:43,047 --> 00:59:44,173
Let's show her the reactor.

754
00:59:44,173 --> 00:59:47,760
We're meeting her there in 35 minutes
so you'd better get dressed.

755
00:59:47,927 --> 00:59:51,180
You brought me out here
to show me this, Mr. Fox?

756
00:59:51,431 --> 00:59:54,100
Bear with me, Miss Tate.

757
00:59:57,643 --> 01:00:01,522
Please keep hands and feet
inside the car at all time.

758
01:00:06,611 --> 01:00:08,905
This is it, isn't it?

759
01:00:08,988 --> 01:00:10,990
The reactor is beneath the river

760
01:00:11,116 --> 01:00:15,619
So it can be instantly flooded in
the event of a security breach.

761
01:00:15,703 --> 01:00:19,623
Is Bruce Wayne really that paranoid?

762
01:00:19,665 --> 01:00:22,293
You want to beat the freak out on that one.

763
01:00:28,550 --> 01:00:31,636
I thought you might like to see
what your investment built.

764
01:00:31,719 --> 01:00:36,015
No fossil fuels, free clean
energy for an entire city!

765
01:00:36,098 --> 01:00:39,477
Three years ago, a Russian
scientist published

766
01:00:39,435 --> 01:00:42,313
a paper on weaponized fusion reactions.

767
01:00:42,355 --> 01:00:47,569
One week later, your reactor
started developing problems.

768
01:00:47,694 --> 01:00:50,028
I think this machine works.

769
01:00:50,154 --> 01:00:56,910
Miranda, if it were operational,
danger to Gotham would be too great.

770
01:00:56,952 --> 01:01:00,206
Would it make you feel better
to know that the Russian

771
01:01:00,206 --> 01:01:03,042
scientist died in a plane
crash six months ago?

772
01:01:03,125 --> 01:01:06,796
Someone will work out what Dr. Pavel

773
01:01:06,837 --> 01:01:09,839
has almost figured out, a way to make

774
01:01:09,839 --> 01:01:12,842
this power source into a nuclear weapon.

775
01:01:14,094 --> 01:01:20,392
I need you to take control of Wayne
Enterprises and this reactor.

776
01:01:20,434 --> 01:01:22,853
- To do what with it?
- Nothing.

777
01:01:23,645 --> 01:01:27,356
- Until we can guarantee its safety.
- And if we can't?

778
01:01:27,398 --> 01:01:29,066
Decommission it, flood it.

779
01:01:29,192 --> 01:01:32,987
Destroy the world's best chance
for a sustainable future?

780
01:01:33,071 --> 01:01:34,739
If the world is not ready, yes.

781
01:01:34,864 --> 01:01:39,202
Bruce, if you want to save the world,
you have to start trusting it.

782
01:01:39,285 --> 01:01:40,245
I'm trusting you.

783
01:01:40,245 --> 01:01:42,872
It doesn't count. You have no choice.

784
01:01:42,956 --> 01:01:45,958
I could have flooded this chamber at
any time in the last three years.

785
01:01:46,041 --> 01:01:50,255
I am choosing to trust you. Please...

786
01:01:57,429 --> 01:02:01,558
Alright ladies and gentlemen, this
meeting will now come to order.

787
01:02:01,600 --> 01:02:04,685
Now, I'd like to point out that
we have a non-board member here.

788
01:02:04,769 --> 01:02:08,356
There is highly irregular, even if
his family name is above the door.

789
01:02:08,439 --> 01:02:10,650
Bruce Wayne's family built this company.

790
01:02:10,691 --> 01:02:14,779
- And he himself has run it...
- Into the ground, sir!

791
01:02:14,862 --> 01:02:15,947
Does anybody disagree?

792
01:02:16,030 --> 01:02:17,739
Then check the share price this morning.

793
01:02:17,739 --> 01:02:22,493
Crazy gambling on future, this does
not only cost Mr. Wayne his seat,

794
01:02:22,535 --> 01:02:26,873
it has cost us all a lot
of money and he has to go.

795
01:02:26,956 --> 01:02:30,043
I'm afraid he has a point, Mr. Wayne.

796
01:02:37,343 --> 01:02:39,052
Now back to business.

797
01:02:40,720 --> 01:02:42,597
How does it feel to be one
of the people, Wayne?

798
01:02:42,597 --> 01:02:44,307
Mr. Wayne, they're towing your car.

799
01:02:44,391 --> 01:02:47,894
I didn't know that you were at the
board, I didn't know what to say.

800
01:02:48,645 --> 01:02:50,230
Looks like you need a ride huh?

801
01:02:53,108 --> 01:02:56,403
How the hell did Miranda Tate get the
inside track on the Wayne Board?

802
01:02:56,361 --> 01:02:59,197
I mean, has she been meeting with him?
Has she been sleeping with him?

803
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:00,239
Not that we know of.

804
01:03:00,239 --> 01:03:02,950
Oh clearly, you don't know much of
anything, do you? Where is Bane?

805
01:03:03,284 --> 01:03:05,745
- Well, we told him it was urgent.
- Oh, where is that man...

806
01:03:05,787 --> 01:03:09,249
Speak of the devil, and he shall appear.

807
01:03:09,290 --> 01:03:12,377
What the hell is going on?

808
01:03:12,585 --> 01:03:15,464
The plan is preceding as expected.

809
01:03:15,548 --> 01:03:19,593
Really? Do I look like I'm running
Wayne Enterprises right now?

810
01:03:19,634 --> 01:03:23,513
Your hit on the stock exchange,
it didn't work my friend.

811
01:03:23,555 --> 01:03:26,183
And now you have my construction crews

812
01:03:26,183 --> 01:03:29,352
going around the city at 24 hours a day.

813
01:03:29,435 --> 01:03:34,940
How exactly is that supposed to
help my company absorb Wayne's?

814
01:03:36,942 --> 01:03:39,528
- Leave us!
- No! You stay here!

815
01:03:39,569 --> 01:03:41,196
I'm in charge.

816
01:03:41,863 --> 01:03:45,242
Do you feel in charge?

817
01:03:49,204 --> 01:03:50,956
I have paid you a small fortune.

818
01:03:51,123 --> 01:03:54,375
And this gives you power over me?

819
01:03:54,625 --> 01:03:56,044
What is this?

820
01:03:56,169 --> 01:04:01,550
Your money and infrastructure
have been important...

821
01:04:01,592 --> 01:04:03,135
until now.

822
01:04:03,177 --> 01:04:06,263
- What are you?
- I'm Gotham's reckoning.

823
01:04:06,347 --> 01:04:09,850
It'll end the ball of damns
you've all been living on.

824
01:04:11,226 --> 01:04:14,437
You are pure evil.

825
01:04:14,437 --> 01:04:17,441
- A necessary evil.
- No!

826
01:04:23,363 --> 01:04:25,908
Well you've started quite a mess.

827
01:04:26,033 --> 01:04:27,743
To protect the people closest to me.

828
01:04:27,826 --> 01:04:30,203
Yeah but you're a loner, right?
You don't have any family.

829
01:04:30,161 --> 01:04:31,996
There are always people you care about.

830
01:04:33,790 --> 01:04:36,334
You don't realize how
much until they're gone.

831
01:04:36,376 --> 01:04:39,295
The idea was to be a symbol.

832
01:04:39,379 --> 01:04:44,759
Batman can be anybody. That was the point.

833
01:04:44,884 --> 01:04:48,095
- That was damn good to see him back.
- Not everybody agrees.

834
01:04:48,178 --> 01:04:49,847
I'll figure that out in the end.

835
01:04:49,847 --> 01:04:52,600
Have you got anything
on Bane's whereabouts?

836
01:04:53,017 --> 01:04:56,312
Yeah, I've got 500 pages of
tunnel records and a flashlight.

837
01:04:56,353 --> 01:04:58,064
I could use some help actually.

838
01:04:59,440 --> 01:05:01,359
You know what, drop me in the old town.

839
01:05:05,737 --> 01:05:08,615
<i>- Hey, hey, hey, I don't think so!
- I don't think it works, hey!</i>

840
01:05:08,657 --> 01:05:10,742
He's not a mark.

841
01:05:10,826 --> 01:05:13,537
And he doesn't have a
cent to his name anyway.

842
01:05:14,162 --> 01:05:18,292
Yeah. It's not much, but it's
more than you've got right now.

843
01:05:18,417 --> 01:05:21,211
Actually, they're letting
me keep the house.

844
01:05:21,295 --> 01:05:23,964
The riches don't even go broke
like the rest of us huh?

845
01:05:24,047 --> 01:05:28,177
My powerful friend might hope to
change your mind about leaving.

846
01:05:28,218 --> 01:05:30,721
- And how would he do that?
- By giving you what you want.

847
01:05:30,804 --> 01:05:33,891
- It doesn't exist.
- He says it does.

848
01:05:34,016 --> 01:05:36,727
- He wants to meet tonight.
- Why?

849
01:05:36,852 --> 01:05:40,856
He needs to find Bane.
He says you know how.

850
01:05:43,525 --> 01:05:47,821
- Tell him I'll think about it.
- Okay. I like your place.

851
01:05:49,239 --> 01:05:51,324
Mr. Wayne.

852
01:05:52,867 --> 01:05:55,745
I'm sorry they took all your money.

853
01:05:56,120 --> 01:05:58,247
No you're not.

854
01:05:58,623 --> 01:06:01,041
- Can we help you officer?
- Yeah.

855
01:06:01,166 --> 01:06:03,960
John Daggett's body was just
found in a dumpster an hour ago.

856
01:06:03,919 --> 01:06:06,381
Thought you might wanna know.

857
01:06:06,506 --> 01:06:07,548
Why?

858
01:06:07,507 --> 01:06:09,342
Well his name is all over
these permits I just

859
01:06:09,342 --> 01:06:10,969
pulled to half the tunnels under Gotham.

860
01:06:11,094 --> 01:06:15,140
That's MTA maintenance, sewer
construction and others things...

861
01:06:15,223 --> 01:06:17,434
Where did you get to with
the tunnel searches?

862
01:06:18,476 --> 01:06:21,729
Remind me to tell detail
to keep hot heads out.

863
01:06:21,770 --> 01:06:23,731
We've had teams down there.
It's a huge network.

864
01:06:23,814 --> 01:06:25,399
Well, get more men.

865
01:06:25,441 --> 01:06:27,401
Work the grid. I want him found.

866
01:06:27,443 --> 01:06:29,820
Yeah, the masked man. We're on it.

867
01:06:29,904 --> 01:06:32,698
Lose the uniform. You're
working for me now.

868
01:06:32,823 --> 01:06:35,243
We could some hot heads around here.

869
01:06:35,368 --> 01:06:37,369
Sir, Daggett's death could
only be a coincidence.

870
01:06:37,369 --> 01:06:38,912
You're a detective now, son.

871
01:06:39,079 --> 01:06:42,874
You're not allowed to believe
in coincidence anymore.

872
01:06:53,887 --> 01:06:57,014
- Nobody's answering.
- No...

873
01:06:57,097 --> 01:07:01,310
- I'm on my own now.
- Do you have keys?

874
01:07:02,144 --> 01:07:03,729
I wouldn't even know.

875
01:07:09,943 --> 01:07:12,237
I hope you didn't like me for my money.

876
01:07:12,237 --> 01:07:14,530
Suffering this character.

877
01:07:20,953 --> 01:07:24,165
I'll take care of your
parents legacy, Bruce.

878
01:07:25,625 --> 01:07:27,710
Who's this?

879
01:07:34,509 --> 01:07:36,427
Where is Alfred?

880
01:07:37,679 --> 01:07:39,597
He left.

881
01:07:40,848 --> 01:07:42,767
Taking everything...

882
01:08:06,415 --> 01:08:11,420
- What's that?
- Hmm well, power has been shut off.

883
01:08:16,425 --> 01:08:18,510
You're good at that.

884
01:08:18,802 --> 01:08:21,597
When I was a child, we had almost nothing.

885
01:08:21,680 --> 01:08:27,477
But on the nights when we had a
fire, we felt very rich indeed...

886
01:08:28,394 --> 01:08:31,814
I assumed your family was wealthy.

887
01:08:32,190 --> 01:08:36,277
Not always, not when I was young.

888
01:08:36,820 --> 01:08:41,533
- An old mistake.
- I had a few myself.

889
01:08:42,784 --> 01:08:45,160
More than a few.

890
01:08:46,745 --> 01:08:50,332
We could leave tonight.

891
01:08:50,499 --> 01:08:55,087
Take my plane and go anywhere we wanted.

892
01:08:56,256 --> 01:09:00,552
Some day perhaps. Not tonight.

893
01:09:28,536 --> 01:09:30,622
Don't be shy!

894
01:09:32,374 --> 01:09:34,793
Wayne says you can get
me the 'Clean Slate'.

895
01:09:34,960 --> 01:09:38,088
- That depends...
- On what?

896
01:09:38,129 --> 01:09:39,715
On what you want it for..

897
01:09:39,798 --> 01:09:42,926
I've acquired it to keep
it out of the wrong hands.

898
01:09:42,968 --> 01:09:45,470
Still don't trust me huh...

899
01:09:45,637 --> 01:09:50,559
- How can we change that?
- Start by taking me to Bane.

900
01:09:53,437 --> 01:09:55,230
You asked...

901
01:09:57,066 --> 01:09:59,525
From here, Bane's men patrol the tunnels

902
01:09:59,525 --> 01:10:01,819
and they're not your average brawlers.

903
01:10:02,403 --> 01:10:04,072
Neither am I.

904
01:10:11,538 --> 01:10:12,622
- He's behind you!
- Who?

905
01:10:12,664 --> 01:10:14,165
Me!

906
01:10:19,044 --> 01:10:20,421
Where do you think you're...

907
01:10:33,101 --> 01:10:34,852
Just a little forward.

908
01:10:42,234 --> 01:10:44,987
I had to find a way to stop
them trying to kill me.

909
01:10:45,070 --> 01:10:47,781
You made a serious mistake.

910
01:10:47,823 --> 01:10:50,993
Not as serious as yours...

911
01:10:50,993 --> 01:10:53,161
I fear.

912
01:10:56,080 --> 01:11:01,169
- Bane...
- Let's not stand on so moody here.

913
01:11:01,836 --> 01:11:04,799
Mr. Wayne...

914
01:11:15,392 --> 01:11:17,269
Peace has cost you your strength.

915
01:11:17,352 --> 01:11:19,855
Victory has defeated you.

916
01:12:20,831 --> 01:12:23,584
Theatricality and deception...

917
01:12:23,667 --> 01:12:26,377
powerful agents to the uninitiated.

918
01:12:26,461 --> 01:12:30,132
But we are initiated aren't we, Bruce?

919
01:12:30,174 --> 01:12:32,843
Members of the League of Shadows.

920
01:12:34,971 --> 01:12:37,348
And you betrayed us.

921
01:12:38,307 --> 01:12:44,062
Yes. You were excommunicated
by a gang of psychopaths.

922
01:12:47,691 --> 01:12:50,986
I am the League of Shadows.

923
01:12:51,069 --> 01:12:54,990
I'm here to fulfill Ra's Al Ghul's destiny!

924
01:13:07,751 --> 01:13:11,964
You fight like a younger man,
there's nothing held back.

925
01:13:12,257 --> 01:13:16,344
It's admirable, but mistaken.

926
01:13:19,847 --> 01:13:23,517
Ooh, you think darkness is your ally?

927
01:13:23,559 --> 01:13:29,357
You merely adopted the
dark, I was born in it.

928
01:13:29,440 --> 01:13:32,652
Molded by it...

929
01:13:32,819 --> 01:13:36,197
I didn't see the light
until I was already a man.

930
01:13:36,280 --> 01:13:39,324
By then there was nothing
to be but blinded.

931
01:13:41,827 --> 01:13:46,331
Shadows betray you because
they belong to me!

932
01:13:51,003 --> 01:13:54,632
I will show you where I have made my home.

933
01:13:54,673 --> 01:13:58,302
Whilst preparing to bring justice.

934
01:14:00,179 --> 01:14:02,890
Then I will break you.

935
01:14:11,023 --> 01:14:15,234
Your precious armory! Gratefully accepted.

936
01:14:15,276 --> 01:14:17,611
We will need it.

937
01:14:25,745 --> 01:14:29,749
Ah yes! I was wondering
what would weight first...

938
01:14:33,877 --> 01:14:35,963
Your spirit...

939
01:14:39,968 --> 01:14:42,095
or your body?

940
01:15:25,346 --> 01:15:26,555
Get me Commissioner Gordon.

941
01:15:26,639 --> 01:15:28,640
I've got a line on the
congressman's kidnapping.

942
01:15:41,194 --> 01:15:42,612
- Excuse me, miss!
- Yes?

943
01:15:42,696 --> 01:15:45,906
I'm gonna need to see your ticket
and identification, please.

944
01:15:46,157 --> 01:15:48,659
Do you mind?

945
01:16:00,630 --> 01:16:03,509
I showed your picture to the congressman.
Guess what?!

946
01:16:03,884 --> 01:16:07,887
- Don't tell me. Still in love?
- Oh head over heels.

947
01:16:08,054 --> 01:16:09,764
Pressing charges though.

948
01:16:09,931 --> 01:16:13,643
You've made some mistakes, Miss Kyle.

949
01:16:13,810 --> 01:16:17,564
- Girls got to eat.
- And you have an appetite.

950
01:16:17,647 --> 01:16:20,150
Why would run? You can't hide
from us with a record like this.

951
01:16:20,233 --> 01:16:24,236
- Maybe it's not you I'm running from.
- Who then? Bane?

952
01:16:24,278 --> 01:16:25,905
What do you know about him?

953
01:16:25,988 --> 01:16:29,867
About you should be as
afraid of him as I am.

954
01:16:29,951 --> 01:16:32,036
We can offer you protection.

955
01:16:34,872 --> 01:16:36,582
Okay...

956
01:16:40,626 --> 01:16:45,047
When I spotted you, I was looking
for a friend of mine, Bruce Wayne.

957
01:16:47,301 --> 01:16:49,094
Did they kill him?

958
01:16:50,554 --> 01:16:52,765
I'm not sure.

959
01:17:11,950 --> 01:17:16,788
Why didn't you just... kill me?

960
01:17:16,747 --> 01:17:20,791
You don't fear death, you welcome it.

961
01:17:20,750 --> 01:17:23,961
Your punishment must be mastered here.

962
01:17:23,961 --> 01:17:27,465
- You're a torturer?
- Yes.

963
01:17:27,965 --> 01:17:31,303
But not of your body.

964
01:17:33,806 --> 01:17:36,015
Of your soul.

965
01:17:35,974 --> 01:17:40,186
- Where am I?
- Home.

966
01:17:40,145 --> 01:17:46,026
Where I learned the truth
about despair, as will you.

967
01:17:46,026 --> 01:17:50,404
There's a reason why this prison
used to were as hell on earth.

968
01:17:50,362 --> 01:17:52,114
Hope.

969
01:17:52,114 --> 01:17:55,825
Every man who has lotted here over the
centuries, has looked up to the light

970
01:17:55,784 --> 01:17:59,496
and imagined climbing to freedom.

971
01:17:59,454 --> 01:18:04,125
So easy, so simple!

972
01:18:04,084 --> 01:18:10,340
And like shipwrecked men turning to
seawater foregoing uncontrollable thirst,

973
01:18:11,634 --> 01:18:14,428
many have died trying.

974
01:18:14,386 --> 01:18:19,516
And then here there can be no
true despair without hope.

975
01:18:19,475 --> 01:18:21,685
So as I terrorize Gotham,

976
01:18:21,685 --> 01:18:26,482
I will feed its people hope
to poison their souls.

977
01:18:27,107 --> 01:18:29,902
I will let them believe
that they can survive

978
01:18:29,902 --> 01:18:33,154
so that you can watch them
climbing over each other

979
01:18:33,113 --> 01:18:36,408
to stay in the sun.

980
01:18:38,535 --> 01:18:42,247
You can watch me torture an entire city.

981
01:18:42,205 --> 01:18:46,460
And then when you've truly understood
the depth of your failure,

982
01:18:46,418 --> 01:18:49,170
we will fulfill Ra's Al Ghul's destiny.

983
01:18:52,757 --> 01:18:55,886
We will destroy Gotham.

984
01:18:56,553 --> 01:19:04,060
And then, when that is done,
and Gotham is... ashes

985
01:19:09,231 --> 01:19:12,860
Then you have my permission to die.

986
01:19:26,039 --> 01:19:27,749
You're locking her up in here?

987
01:19:27,791 --> 01:19:31,670
The Dent act allows non-segregation
based on extraordinary needs.

988
01:19:31,628 --> 01:19:34,673
First time she broke out of
women's correctional, she was 16.

989
01:19:34,756 --> 01:19:39,053
- Yeah, a little closer!
- Why honey? You want to hold my hand?

990
01:19:39,387 --> 01:19:41,222
She's gonna be fine.

991
01:19:41,889 --> 01:19:45,475
I still don't see the need of a board
meeting for the energy project.

992
01:19:45,475 --> 01:19:47,019
Bruce got a lot of things right,

993
01:19:47,019 --> 01:19:49,605
keeping the board in the
dark was not one of them.

994
01:19:52,357 --> 01:19:57,237
How good of you to join us Chair President.

995
01:19:57,196 --> 01:20:00,824
All I need now is one more
ordinary Board member.

996
01:20:00,866 --> 01:20:07,831
- Mr. Fox, would you like to nominate?
- No. I will volunteer.

997
01:20:07,831 --> 01:20:10,083
Where are you taking us?

998
01:20:19,968 --> 01:20:21,344
You were right, Commissioner!

999
01:20:21,510 --> 01:20:23,095
Would you excuse us, please?

1000
01:20:23,095 --> 01:20:24,096
What happened?

1001
01:20:24,263 --> 01:20:26,599
Your mask man kidnapped the
Wayne Enterprise's board.

1002
01:20:26,557 --> 01:20:29,727
He let most of them go, but he took
three of them into the sewers.

1003
01:20:29,727 --> 01:20:31,938
No more patrols. No more hide and seek.

1004
01:20:31,896 --> 01:20:34,941
Get every available cop down
there and smoke him out.

1005
01:20:34,899 --> 01:20:39,152
- The Mayor won't want panic.
- So it's a training exercise?

1006
01:20:41,530 --> 01:20:44,366
I'm sorry I didn't take you seriously.

1007
01:20:44,324 --> 01:20:48,329
Not you, you're telling
me the Batman has gone.

1008
01:20:48,287 --> 01:20:53,417
So you chase up the Daggett
leads anyway you can.

1009
01:20:53,375 --> 01:20:54,794
Yes, sir.

1010
01:21:04,262 --> 01:21:09,934
He asks how much you would
pay us to let you die?

1011
01:21:09,892 --> 01:21:12,729
I told him... I told him you have nothing.

1012
01:21:12,687 --> 01:21:14,314
You tell your friend it's a pleasure!

1013
01:21:14,314 --> 01:21:18,567
They pay more than that to keep you alive.

1014
01:21:25,073 --> 01:21:27,492
He will try to climb.

1015
01:21:41,088 --> 01:21:44,217
Is there any way everybody head?

1016
01:21:44,176 --> 01:21:47,012
Well of course not!

1017
01:21:56,312 --> 01:21:59,482
He says there is one who did.

1018
01:21:59,440 --> 01:22:01,275
A child.

1019
01:22:02,568 --> 01:22:05,405
A child born in this hell.

1020
01:22:05,613 --> 01:22:10,284
- Bane...
- An old legend. Nothing more.

1021
01:22:15,122 --> 01:22:20,252
Whatever it is they want you
to see, it is happening soon.

1022
01:22:45,193 --> 01:22:47,445
Fire in the hole!

1023
01:23:14,723 --> 01:23:16,766
Turn it on!

1024
01:23:20,479 --> 01:23:25,316
I only need one other Board member,
there are eight others waiting.

1025
01:23:25,274 --> 01:23:26,859
I won't do it.

1026
01:23:27,318 --> 01:23:29,320
Alright stop!

1027
01:23:29,320 --> 01:23:32,657
Lucius, you will kill
this man and yourself,

1028
01:23:32,615 --> 01:23:35,159
and you'll barely slow them down.

1029
01:24:00,225 --> 01:24:04,020
Go on then, do your work!

1030
01:24:06,189 --> 01:24:08,316
Take them up to the surface!

1031
01:24:08,275 --> 01:24:12,446
People of their status
deserve to experience

1032
01:24:12,404 --> 01:24:16,033
the next era of Western civilization.

1033
01:24:19,577 --> 01:24:21,704
I've been at half of Daggett
cement plants logged

1034
01:24:21,662 --> 01:24:23,873
locations they pour for
underground construction.

1035
01:24:23,873 --> 01:24:25,833
<i>Anything strange about the pourings?</i>

1036
01:24:25,792 --> 01:24:30,296
Honestly, Commissioner. I don't know
anything about civil engineering.

1037
01:24:30,255 --> 01:24:33,716
But you know about patterns. Keep looking!

1038
01:24:38,304 --> 01:24:43,476
It's done. This is now a
4 megatons nuclear bomb!

1039
01:24:44,936 --> 01:24:48,815
Pull the core out of the reactor!

1040
01:24:48,774 --> 01:24:51,360
No! You cannot!

1041
01:24:51,318 --> 01:24:55,446
This is the only power source
capable of sustaining it.

1042
01:24:55,404 --> 01:24:59,699
If you move it, the core will
decay in a matter of months.

1043
01:24:59,658 --> 01:25:03,829
- Five, by my calculations.
- It will go off!

1044
01:25:05,247 --> 01:25:11,628
And for the sake of your children
Dr. Pavel, Indeed I hope it does.

1045
01:25:11,587 --> 01:25:14,672
Hey, hey!

1046
01:25:16,716 --> 01:25:19,595
That was you in front of the
Stock Exchange wasn't it?

1047
01:25:20,471 --> 01:25:21,847
When?

1048
01:25:21,889 --> 01:25:24,683
When half the city's cops try
to pull onto Castle street

1049
01:25:24,683 --> 01:25:26,393
and your truck was shutting them out.

1050
01:25:26,352 --> 01:25:30,064
- Oh yeah... you're the cop.
- Detective now.

1051
01:25:30,022 --> 01:25:34,317
And, as detective we're not allowed
to believe in coincidences.

1052
01:25:44,036 --> 01:25:46,788
What were you doing here?
What are you working on?

1053
01:25:54,462 --> 01:25:59,008
Commissioner, it's Blake. I've got two
dead witnesses and a lot of questions.

1054
01:25:58,967 --> 01:26:00,134
Call me when...

1055
01:26:00,678 --> 01:26:04,682
Wait a minute! Four barrels
of poly-isobutilene.

1056
01:26:06,100 --> 01:26:08,977
That looks like motor oil
right next to it. Jesus!

1057
01:26:08,935 --> 01:26:12,980
They're not making cement,
they're making explosives!

1058
01:26:19,361 --> 01:26:22,281
<i>- Pass me to Foley!
- Foley is overseeing the operation.</i>

1059
01:26:22,281 --> 01:26:24,867
They're heading into a trap.

1060
01:26:24,825 --> 01:26:27,494
We're seeing literally thousands
of police heading into the sewer.

1061
01:26:27,452 --> 01:26:29,287
Mr. Mayor, literally thousands of police...

1062
01:26:29,287 --> 01:26:31,289
It's just a training exercise, that's all.

1063
01:26:31,414 --> 01:26:32,541
Now, if you'll excuse me,

1064
01:26:32,541 --> 01:26:34,918
I've got tickets to watch
our boys trash Rapid City.

1065
01:26:37,087 --> 01:26:37,921
Foley.

1066
01:26:38,005 --> 01:26:39,631
<i>It's a trap. Pull all of them out!</i>

1067
01:26:39,590 --> 01:26:41,842
Bane has been pouring concrete
rings with explosives.

1068
01:26:41,800 --> 01:26:43,344
Where?

1069
01:26:58,400 --> 01:27:00,069
<i>There's a ring around the tunnels!</i>

1070
01:27:00,069 --> 01:27:02,446
They're gonna blow it and
trap the cops underground!

1071
01:27:03,238 --> 01:27:06,533
Pull them out. Pull them out! Now!

1072
01:27:30,098 --> 01:27:32,684
That's a lovely lovely voice!

1073
01:28:12,765 --> 01:28:15,310
Let the games begin!

1074
01:29:48,024 --> 01:29:53,780
Citizens, take control...

1075
01:29:54,030 --> 01:29:58,409
Take control of your city!

1076
01:30:02,997 --> 01:30:05,000
- Foley!
- Jesus, Blake!

1077
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:08,502
Every cop in the city is
down in those tunnels!

1078
01:30:08,460 --> 01:30:09,587
Not every cop.

1079
01:30:23,519 --> 01:30:26,854
Sir, you're okay? I'm a police
officer, I need your car right now.

1080
01:31:16,695 --> 01:31:18,905
Play the corners, rookie!

1081
01:31:19,697 --> 01:31:21,699
Get the coat, son!

1082
01:31:21,658 --> 01:31:28,164
This, this is the instrument
of your liberation.

1083
01:31:30,125 --> 01:31:33,253
Satellite shows a radiation spike.

1084
01:31:33,253 --> 01:31:36,423
Whatever it is, it's nuclear.

1085
01:31:40,176 --> 01:31:43,764
Identify yourself to the world!

1086
01:31:44,681 --> 01:31:49,186
Dr. Leonid Pavel, nuclear physicist.

1087
01:31:49,603 --> 01:31:53,190
Pavel was confirmed dead, plane crash on an

1088
01:31:53,190 --> 01:31:57,610
agency pull out of Uzbekistan
but it looks like it's him.

1089
01:31:57,568 --> 01:32:01,447
And what, what is this?

1090
01:32:01,406 --> 01:32:08,203
It's a fully prime neutron bomb
with a blast radius of 6 miles.

1091
01:32:08,162 --> 01:32:12,583
And who is capable of
disarming such a device?

1092
01:32:13,750 --> 01:32:15,501
Only me.

1093
01:32:15,501 --> 01:32:20,423
Only you... Thank you, good doctor!

1094
01:32:23,426 --> 01:32:26,722
Now, this bomb is armed.

1095
01:32:26,722 --> 01:32:33,687
This bomb is mobile and the identity
of the trigger man is a mystery.

1096
01:32:34,438 --> 01:32:39,359
For one of you holds the detonator.

1097
01:32:39,318 --> 01:32:43,906
Now we came here not as
conquerors, but as liberators

1098
01:32:43,864 --> 01:32:48,410
to return control of
this city to the people.

1099
01:32:49,703 --> 01:32:54,999
And at the first sight of
interference from the outside world,

1100
01:32:54,958 --> 01:32:59,504
or from those people attempting to flee,

1101
01:33:00,672 --> 01:33:04,008
this anonymous Gotham-might,

1102
01:33:03,967 --> 01:33:08,805
this unsung hero will trigger the bomb.

1103
01:33:10,140 --> 01:33:13,643
But now, martial law is in effect.

1104
01:33:13,602 --> 01:33:16,772
Return to your homes,

1105
01:33:16,772 --> 01:33:22,235
hold your families closed and wait.

1106
01:33:22,193 --> 01:33:27,322
Tomorrow you claim what
is rightfully yours.

1107
01:33:31,618 --> 01:33:36,790
Go back the fighters! Start high
level reconnaissance flights.

1108
01:33:37,082 --> 01:33:39,710
Get the president on the line!

1109
01:33:59,605 --> 01:34:04,025
<i>Tanks and planes cannot stop
us from detonating our device.</i>

1110
01:34:03,984 --> 01:34:06,361
<i>Send a negotiator to discuss terms</i>

1111
01:34:06,361 --> 01:34:09,322
<i>of access for supplies and communication!</i>

1112
01:34:14,786 --> 01:34:17,206
How many of you are there, son?

1113
01:34:18,499 --> 01:34:20,250
You don't have enough men to stop

1114
01:34:20,250 --> 01:34:22,543
12 million people leaving this island.

1115
01:34:23,419 --> 01:34:26,965
No, no we don't. But you do.

1116
01:34:28,132 --> 01:34:31,635
And why the hell would I try to
help you keep your hostages?

1117
01:34:31,635 --> 01:34:37,058
If one person crosses this bridge,
Gotham gets blown to hell.

1118
01:34:42,271 --> 01:34:45,065
<i>The people of our greatest
city are resilient</i>

1119
01:34:46,025 --> 01:34:50,821
<i>They have proven this before
and they will prove it again.</i>

1120
01:34:50,780 --> 01:34:55,201
<i>We do not negotiate with terrorists,</i>

1121
01:34:55,159 --> 01:34:58,121
<i>But we do recognize realities.</i>

1122
01:34:58,079 --> 01:35:05,168
<i>As this situation develops, one thing
must be understood above all others.</i>

1123
01:35:05,586 --> 01:35:09,089
<i>People of Gotham, we
have not abandoned you.</i>

1124
01:35:09,089 --> 01:35:11,008
What does that mean?

1125
01:35:10,966 --> 01:35:13,844
It means we're on our own.

1126
01:35:13,802 --> 01:35:15,930
I have to get in front of a camera.

1127
01:35:15,930 --> 01:35:18,974
Well sir, they will kill you
the second you show your face.

1128
01:35:18,933 --> 01:35:21,852
Bane says he's giving
Gotham back to the people.

1129
01:35:21,894 --> 01:35:23,229
They need to know I could lead.

1130
01:35:23,229 --> 01:35:24,897
Bane is not going to let that happen.

1131
01:35:24,855 --> 01:35:28,234
- Then he'll show his true colors
- And you'll be dead.

1132
01:35:46,417 --> 01:35:51,130
Behind you, stands a symbol of oppression.

1133
01:35:52,173 --> 01:35:56,843
Blackgate Prison, where a thousand men have

1134
01:35:56,802 --> 01:36:01,015
languished under the name of this man:

1135
01:36:01,099 --> 01:36:04,269
Harvey Dent.

1136
01:36:04,310 --> 01:36:11,276
Who has been held up to you as
the shinning example of justice.

1137
01:36:11,234 --> 01:36:13,903
We'll just keep moving you until
we get you in front of a camera.

1138
01:36:13,861 --> 01:36:17,782
You have been supplied with a false idol,

1139
01:36:17,740 --> 01:36:22,036
to stop you tearing down this corrupt city!

1140
01:36:21,994 --> 01:36:26,415
Let me tell you the truth
about Harvey Dent!

1141
01:36:26,415 --> 01:36:31,128
From the words of Gotham's
Police Commissioner,

1142
01:36:31,128 --> 01:36:34,047
James Gordon.

1143
01:36:34,006 --> 01:36:39,970
' The Batman didn't murder
Harvey Dent, he saved my boy. '

1144
01:36:39,928 --> 01:36:43,933
' Then took the blame for
Harvey's appalling crimes, '

1145
01:36:43,892 --> 01:36:47,062
' So that I could, to my shame, '

1146
01:36:47,020 --> 01:36:54,026
' build a lie around this fallen idol. '

1147
01:36:55,402 --> 01:37:01,074
' I praise the mad man who tried
to murder my own child, '

1148
01:37:00,991 --> 01:37:04,953
' but I can no longer live with my lie. '

1149
01:37:04,911 --> 01:37:09,081
' It is time to trust the people
of Gotham with the truth '

1150
01:37:09,081 --> 01:37:13,502
' And it is time for me to resign. '

1151
01:37:13,461 --> 01:37:17,590
And do you accept this man's resignation?

1152
01:37:19,008 --> 01:37:23,764
And do you accept the
resignation of all these liars,

1153
01:37:23,722 --> 01:37:25,515
of all the corrupt?

1154
01:37:28,768 --> 01:37:32,355
Those men locked up for 8
years at Blackgate with

1155
01:37:32,355 --> 01:37:35,775
denied parole under the Dent
act, it was based on a lie?

1156
01:37:35,775 --> 01:37:38,320
Gotham needed a hero.

1157
01:37:38,320 --> 01:37:42,449
It needs it now more than ever. You
betrayed everything you stood for.

1158
01:37:44,074 --> 01:37:46,035
There's a point,

1159
01:37:47,912 --> 01:37:50,956
far out there when the structures fail you,

1160
01:37:50,915 --> 01:37:54,377
and when the rules aren't weapons
anymore with you... you shackle those,

1161
01:37:54,377 --> 01:37:57,213
letting the bad guy getting in.

1162
01:37:58,422 --> 01:38:03,343
One day, you may face
such a moment of crisis

1163
01:38:03,301 --> 01:38:07,764
and in that moment I hope you
have a friend like I did!

1164
01:38:07,723 --> 01:38:13,896
To plunge their hands into the filth
so that you can keep yours clean.

1165
01:38:13,854 --> 01:38:18,192
Your hands look pretty
filthy to me, Commissioner.

1166
01:38:18,192 --> 01:38:23,029
We take Gotham from the corrupt.

1167
01:38:24,531 --> 01:38:26,116
The rich.

1168
01:38:26,116 --> 01:38:32,747
The oppressors who for generation have
kept you down with myths of opportunity,

1169
01:38:32,664 --> 01:38:38,544
and we give it back to you, the people.

1170
01:38:39,670 --> 01:38:43,716
Gotham is yours. None shall interfere.

1171
01:38:43,674 --> 01:38:46,177
Do as you please,

1172
01:38:46,177 --> 01:38:52,476
and start by storming Blackgate
and freeing the oppressed!

1173
01:39:00,692 --> 01:39:03,820
Step forward those who would serve.

1174
01:39:05,363 --> 01:39:08,908
To an army, a world will be raised.

1175
01:39:11,161 --> 01:39:15,998
The powerful will be ripped
from their decadent years...

1176
01:39:19,876 --> 01:39:26,007
and cast out into the cold
world that we know and endure.

1177
01:39:30,303 --> 01:39:34,308
Courts will be convened.

1178
01:39:39,855 --> 01:39:43,859
Spoils will be enjoyed.

1179
01:39:47,112 --> 01:39:50,282
Blood will be shed.

1180
01:39:52,075 --> 01:39:55,120
The Police will survive

1181
01:39:55,203 --> 01:39:59,791
as they learn to serve true justice...

1182
01:39:59,749 --> 01:40:03,628
This great city...

1183
01:40:04,838 --> 01:40:08,175
it will endure ...!

1184
01:40:09,134 --> 01:40:13,179
Gotham will survive!

1185
01:40:33,949 --> 01:40:37,161
He says you must first fix your back.

1186
01:40:37,161 --> 01:40:38,454
How does he know?

1187
01:40:38,454 --> 01:40:41,832
He was the prison doctor.
A morphine addict,

1188
01:40:41,832 --> 01:40:45,877
who incurred this pleasure
of powerful people,

1189
01:40:45,835 --> 01:40:48,838
including your mask friend.

1190
01:40:48,797 --> 01:40:50,215
How?

1191
01:40:51,341 --> 01:40:56,764
Many years ago, it was a time of plague.

1192
01:40:56,764 --> 01:41:01,394
Some of the other prisoners attacked Bane.

1193
01:41:02,145 --> 01:41:05,355
The doctors humbling attempts
to repair the damage

1194
01:41:05,314 --> 01:41:08,525
left him in perpetual agony.

1195
01:41:08,483 --> 01:41:11,862
The Mask holds the pain at bay.

1196
01:41:11,862 --> 01:41:17,451
Bane was the child who struck out?
He was born here?

1197
01:41:17,409 --> 01:41:22,206
Legend is that there was a mercenary
who worked for a local warlord.

1198
01:41:22,164 --> 01:41:25,542
He fell in love with the
warlord's daughter.

1199
01:41:25,500 --> 01:41:29,546
They were married in secret,
but the warlord found out.

1200
01:41:29,504 --> 01:41:34,134
The mercenary was condemned to this pit.

1201
01:41:34,092 --> 01:41:36,011
But then he exiled him instead.

1202
01:41:36,011 --> 01:41:40,475
The mess, I understood, that was the
daughter that secured his release.

1203
01:41:40,433 --> 01:41:46,354
But what he could not know, was
the true price of his freedom.

1204
01:41:46,270 --> 01:41:50,024
She took his place in the pit.

1205
01:41:51,234 --> 01:41:55,905
And she was with a child,
the mercenary child.

1206
01:41:57,156 --> 01:42:01,660
Innocence cannot flower underground,
it has to be stemmed out...

1207
01:42:03,162 --> 01:42:09,376
One day, the doctor
forgot to lock the cell.

1208
01:42:15,633 --> 01:42:19,803
But the child had a friend, a protector.

1209
01:42:19,761 --> 01:42:24,392
Who showed the others that this
innocence was their redemption.

1210
01:42:24,350 --> 01:42:25,935
It was to be priced.

1211
01:42:25,935 --> 01:42:28,145
The mother was not so lucky.

1212
01:42:30,606 --> 01:42:35,403
This is Bane's prison now. It
wouldn't want this story told.

1213
01:42:45,704 --> 01:42:49,750
There's a vertebra
protruding from your back.

1214
01:42:49,708 --> 01:42:52,294
It has to be put back.

1215
01:42:56,964 --> 01:43:00,592
Stay like this until you stand.

1216
01:43:08,727 --> 01:43:12,022
Could you not think I would return, Bruce?

1217
01:43:17,944 --> 01:43:20,696
I told you I was immortal.

1218
01:43:22,156 --> 01:43:24,117
I watched you die!

1219
01:43:24,075 --> 01:43:28,329
Oh there are many forms of immortality.

1220
01:43:29,289 --> 01:43:33,500
Once I had a wife. My great love.

1221
01:43:35,169 --> 01:43:37,671
She was taken from me.

1222
01:43:37,671 --> 01:43:40,549
You were the mercenary.

1223
01:43:42,468 --> 01:43:47,307
Bane is your child, your heir.

1224
01:43:47,307 --> 01:43:50,101
I'm here to ensure the League of Shadow

1225
01:43:50,059 --> 01:43:53,980
fulfills its duty to restore
balance to civilization.

1226
01:43:53,980 --> 01:43:57,775
You yourself fought the
decadence of Gotham for years

1227
01:43:57,733 --> 01:44:02,071
with all your strength, all your resources,

1228
01:44:02,029 --> 01:44:04,698
all your moral authority.

1229
01:44:04,823 --> 01:44:08,701
And the only victory you
achieved was a lie.

1230
01:44:08,659 --> 01:44:11,829
Now, you understand?
Gotham is beyond saving

1231
01:44:11,829 --> 01:44:14,749
and must be allowed to die.

1232
01:44:31,391 --> 01:44:32,684
No!

1233
01:45:07,468 --> 01:45:09,720
- What's that?
- This was someone's home.

1234
01:45:09,678 --> 01:45:13,099
Now, it's everyone's home.

1235
01:45:13,058 --> 01:45:17,269
There's storm coming remember?
That is what we wanted.

1236
01:45:45,171 --> 01:45:48,007
It's for the bus, in case
there's a chance to evacuate.

1237
01:45:48,383 --> 01:45:51,761
- Any news from the commissioner?
- The less you know father..

1238
01:45:51,761 --> 01:45:53,304
How are the boys doing?

1239
01:45:53,304 --> 01:45:56,684
Well we had more power
on, so they get some TV.

1240
01:45:56,642 --> 01:46:00,145
- It's good to see you father.
- Blake, you be careful out there.

1241
01:46:00,103 --> 01:46:03,064
They're hunting down cops like dogs.

1242
01:46:07,903 --> 01:46:13,116
- Why build yourself?
- I'm not meant to die in here.

1243
01:46:13,116 --> 01:46:17,870
Here or there, what's the difference?

1244
01:47:17,678 --> 01:47:21,100
I told you it could not be done.

1245
01:47:21,058 --> 01:47:23,894
You told me a child did it.

1246
01:47:23,894 --> 01:47:30,024
But no ordinary child,
a child born in hell,

1247
01:47:33,653 --> 01:47:36,197
forged from suffering,

1248
01:47:37,115 --> 01:47:40,409
hardened by pain.

1249
01:47:40,367 --> 01:47:44,622
Not a man from privilege.

1250
01:48:02,139 --> 01:48:04,392
We got blues in the ground sir.

1251
01:48:04,684 --> 01:48:07,227
Just waiting on intel.

1252
01:48:11,857 --> 01:48:14,735
- Do you have ID?
- Of course not.

1253
01:48:14,693 --> 01:48:18,280
- How can we trust you?
- You don't have any choice.

1254
01:48:18,280 --> 01:48:20,574
Commissioner Gordon. Captain
Jones, Special Forces.

1255
01:48:20,574 --> 01:48:23,493
- Captain, glad to have you here.
- It's our job sir.

1256
01:48:23,493 --> 01:48:25,537
Now how many are there?

1257
01:48:25,495 --> 01:48:28,164
Well there's dozens, I'd
rather not say exactly.

1258
01:48:28,164 --> 01:48:30,542
But the men trapped underground,
number almost 3,000.

1259
01:48:30,625 --> 01:48:33,712
- What kind of condition are they in?
- They've been getting food and water.

1260
01:48:33,879 --> 01:48:35,297
- Can we break them out?
- Yes, sir.

1261
01:48:35,297 --> 01:48:38,342
Take out the mercenaries guarding the
outflows south of Ackerman Park,

1262
01:48:38,300 --> 01:48:40,928
blow the rubble, we can make a
hole big enough for 10 at a time.

1263
01:48:40,886 --> 01:48:43,054
Now I'm in contact with my
partner who is down there.

1264
01:48:43,054 --> 01:48:44,430
They're just waiting for the day.

1265
01:48:44,430 --> 01:48:46,642
Commander, they haven't seen
daylight for three months.

1266
01:48:46,600 --> 01:48:48,977
Police officers who haven't
seen daylight in three months.

1267
01:48:48,936 --> 01:48:49,937
What about the bomb?

1268
01:48:49,937 --> 01:48:52,230
The satellite can't pick up
any radiation hot spots.

1269
01:48:52,230 --> 01:48:55,733
How they keep it on a truck? It
must have a lead lined roof.

1270
01:48:55,733 --> 01:48:58,695
- They're moving constantly.
- Good, so you know the truck?

1271
01:48:58,653 --> 01:49:02,114
Well it's one of those three,
we've been tracking it.

1272
01:49:02,406 --> 01:49:03,907
Decoy.

1273
01:49:04,867 --> 01:49:06,869
You don't really think
he's coming back, do you?

1274
01:49:06,827 --> 01:49:07,995
Doesn't matter what I think.

1275
01:49:07,953 --> 01:49:12,166
Actually it does. You should put your faith
in something a little more more real.

1276
01:49:12,124 --> 01:49:14,377
But the routes don't vary much.

1277
01:49:14,377 --> 01:49:17,797
- Ok. What about the trigger man?
- No leads. It's a bluff.

1278
01:49:17,755 --> 01:49:20,340
Bane wouldn't give control of
that bomb to someone else.

1279
01:49:20,298 --> 01:49:21,633
We can't take that chance.

1280
01:49:21,633 --> 01:49:24,219
Until we have the trigger man,
we just track the device.

1281
01:49:24,177 --> 01:49:26,972
And mean while, Gotham
lives under a warlord?

1282
01:49:26,972 --> 01:49:28,349
Like some failed state?

1283
01:49:28,349 --> 01:49:31,352
Dial it back, officer. The
situation is unprecedented.

1284
01:49:31,311 --> 01:49:33,354
We can't do anything to
risk millions of lives.

1285
01:49:33,354 --> 01:49:36,732
Can you tell them? Aren't you going to
tell them what is actually going on?

1286
01:49:36,690 --> 01:49:40,235
Captain, the situation is more
complicated than you think.

1287
01:49:40,194 --> 01:49:42,279
There's someone you need to meet.

1288
01:49:42,279 --> 01:49:44,698
I came up stairs looking
for a vantage point.

1289
01:49:44,657 --> 01:49:47,076
Found the people who run the
corporation living up here.

1290
01:49:47,034 --> 01:49:47,785
What corporation?

1291
01:49:47,785 --> 01:49:49,703
Wayne Enterprises.

1292
01:49:59,254 --> 01:50:01,464
Mr. Fox would you like
to brief the captain?

1293
01:50:01,464 --> 01:50:04,216
Now Ms. Tate is fully
aware of the situation.

1294
01:50:04,216 --> 01:50:08,763
As the CEO of Wayne Enterprises, I
have to take responsibility for it.

1295
01:50:08,721 --> 01:50:10,932
- Why?
- We built it.

1296
01:50:10,932 --> 01:50:12,434
You built the bomb?

1297
01:50:12,392 --> 01:50:16,771
It was build as a fusion reactor.
First of its kind

1298
01:50:16,771 --> 01:50:20,400
Bane turned the core into a bomb,
and removed it from the reactor.

1299
01:50:20,400 --> 01:50:21,609
That is the important part.

1300
01:50:21,609 --> 01:50:23,987
As the device's fuel cells deteriorates,

1301
01:50:23,987 --> 01:50:27,740
it becomes increasingly unstable
to the point of detonation.

1302
01:50:27,740 --> 01:50:31,910
- This bomb is a time bomb.
- And it will go off in 23 days.

1303
01:50:31,869 --> 01:50:34,580
Regardless of Bane's revolution or what we

1304
01:50:34,538 --> 01:50:36,665
and the outside world choose to do.

1305
01:50:36,665 --> 01:50:39,585
So your peace-man plan may not
be as practical as you thought.

1306
01:50:39,585 --> 01:50:40,711
Could you disarm it?

1307
01:50:40,753 --> 01:50:43,923
I could reconnect it to the
reactor to stabilize it.

1308
01:50:43,923 --> 01:50:46,175
Let's move away from this
location and call it in.

1309
01:50:46,175 --> 01:50:46,967
Alright let's go!

1310
01:50:46,967 --> 01:50:50,595
No, I'll take it from here. You
stay and look after these folks.

1311
01:50:57,478 --> 01:50:59,313
Someone sold us out.

1312
01:51:23,044 --> 01:51:25,630
I'd die before I talk.

1313
01:51:25,588 --> 01:51:29,508
How about a new schedule, Captain.

1314
01:51:34,722 --> 01:51:39,645
- There were people living upstairs.
- Round them up for judgment.

1315
01:51:43,398 --> 01:51:48,319
And hang them where the world can see.

1316
01:52:02,833 --> 01:52:07,338
He says the leap of freedom
is not about strength.

1317
01:52:07,296 --> 01:52:11,509
- My body makes the jump.
- Surviving is spirit. The soul.

1318
01:52:16,305 --> 01:52:19,476
My soul is as ready to escape as my body.

1319
01:52:19,434 --> 01:52:22,395
Fear is why you're afraid?

1320
01:52:22,395 --> 01:52:24,897
No, I'm not afraid.

1321
01:52:25,814 --> 01:52:28,024
I'm angry.

1322
01:52:55,802 --> 01:52:57,137
Bruce...

1323
01:52:58,846 --> 01:53:01,140
Why do we fall?

1324
01:53:06,062 --> 01:53:13,070
You do not fear death. You think this
makes you strong? It makes you weak.

1325
01:53:13,946 --> 01:53:15,364
Why?

1326
01:53:15,322 --> 01:53:17,865
How can you move faster than possible,

1327
01:53:17,824 --> 01:53:20,326
fight longer than possible,

1328
01:53:20,326 --> 01:53:24,664
without the most powerful
impulse of the spirit?

1329
01:53:24,622 --> 01:53:27,500
The fear of death.

1330
01:53:27,458 --> 01:53:30,587
I did fear death.

1331
01:53:30,545 --> 01:53:35,632
I fear dying in here, all my city burns,

1332
01:53:35,591 --> 01:53:39,260
there's no one there to save it.

1333
01:53:40,053 --> 01:53:42,680
Then make the climb!

1334
01:53:46,811 --> 01:53:48,521
How?

1335
01:53:49,397 --> 01:53:52,275
As the child did.

1336
01:53:55,694 --> 01:53:59,656
Without the rope.

1337
01:53:59,614 --> 01:54:03,493
That fear will fright you again.

1338
01:54:09,124 --> 01:54:13,503
Ah surprise for your journey,
oh that's wonderful, that's...

1339
01:54:18,466 --> 01:54:21,970
- What does that mean?
- Rise.

1340
01:54:23,054 --> 01:54:24,514
No.

1341
01:55:53,352 --> 01:55:57,398
There's been a mistake. Take me to Bane!

1342
01:55:59,692 --> 01:56:01,609
I want Mr. Bane.

1343
01:56:07,323 --> 01:56:08,616
Where is Bane?

1344
01:56:08,574 --> 01:56:13,412
There's been no mistake Mr. Stryver.
You are Philip Stryver.

1345
01:56:13,371 --> 01:56:17,250
Executive Vice President
of Daggett Industries?

1346
01:56:17,250 --> 01:56:20,210
Who for years has been living off the blood

1347
01:56:20,168 --> 01:56:23,213
and sweat of people less powerful than him!

1348
01:56:23,171 --> 01:56:26,758
Call Bane! I am one of you.

1349
01:56:26,717 --> 01:56:30,762
Bane has no authority here. This
is merely a sentencing hearing.

1350
01:56:30,721 --> 01:56:35,435
Now choice is yours: exile or death?

1351
01:56:41,565 --> 01:56:44,860
- Exile.
- Sold!

1352
01:56:44,819 --> 01:56:47,571
The man in the cold sweat.

1353
01:56:54,203 --> 01:56:58,331
You follow the thick ice. If you try
to swim, you're dead in minutes.

1354
01:56:58,290 --> 01:57:00,083
So no one made it?

1355
01:57:13,346 --> 01:57:14,388
Where the hell are they?

1356
01:57:14,388 --> 01:57:16,056
It's not like we have a lot of time here.

1357
01:57:16,056 --> 01:57:18,977
- How long?
- The bomb goes off tomorrow.

1358
01:57:18,977 --> 01:57:21,271
We have about 18 hours to do something.

1359
01:57:21,271 --> 01:57:21,980
To do what?

1360
01:57:21,938 --> 01:57:23,815
To mark the truck. Get a GPS on it,

1361
01:57:23,815 --> 01:57:26,526
so we can start to figure
out how to bring it down.

1362
01:57:32,948 --> 01:57:34,617
That's it.

1363
01:57:36,702 --> 01:57:38,829
Foley!

1364
01:57:39,288 --> 01:57:41,957
Where is Foley? Damn it!

1365
01:57:41,957 --> 01:57:44,502
You shouldn't be out in the streets.

1366
01:57:47,964 --> 01:57:49,006
Jim, he's not here.

1367
01:57:49,006 --> 01:57:54,011
You let your wife come to the door,
when the city is under occupation?

1368
01:57:54,011 --> 01:57:57,347
What did you do? Bury your
uniform in the backyard?

1369
01:57:57,347 --> 01:57:59,474
You saw what they did
to the special forces.

1370
01:57:59,474 --> 01:58:01,728
Have you forgotten all the
years we were out on patrol?

1371
01:58:01,686 --> 01:58:04,773
When every gang banger wanted to plant
one as soon as our backs were turned?

1372
01:58:04,773 --> 01:58:07,067
Now is different and you know it.
This guys run the city.

1373
01:58:07,067 --> 01:58:08,817
The government has done a deal with them.

1374
01:58:08,776 --> 01:58:11,737
Bane's got their balls in a
vice, that's not a deal.

1375
01:58:11,695 --> 01:58:14,907
If you move on Bane, the trigger-man
is going to hit the button.

1376
01:58:14,865 --> 01:58:19,245
Do you think he's given control of
that bomb to one of the people?

1377
01:58:19,203 --> 01:58:21,831
You think this apart of some revolution?

1378
01:58:21,789 --> 01:58:24,416
There's only one man with his
finger on the button, that's Bane.

1379
01:58:24,374 --> 01:58:27,543
Look, we've all got to keep our
heads down until they can fix this.

1380
01:58:27,543 --> 01:58:29,628
If you had family here...

1381
01:58:29,628 --> 01:58:32,965
It'll only get fixed from inside the city.

1382
01:58:33,090 --> 01:58:39,305
Look Peter, I'm not asking you to
walk down grand in you dress rules,

1383
01:58:39,222 --> 01:58:40,431
but something has to be done.

1384
01:58:40,431 --> 01:58:42,517
- I'm sorry, Jim. I gotta...
- Keep your head down?

1385
01:58:42,517 --> 01:58:45,353
What good that's going to do
tomorrow when that thing blows.

1386
01:58:45,311 --> 01:58:48,189
You don't know that's gonna happen.

1387
01:58:51,651 --> 01:58:54,195
I hear you're looking for men Commissioner?

1388
01:58:54,195 --> 01:58:55,447
How about me instead?

1389
01:58:55,447 --> 01:59:00,618
- Miss Tate, I can't ask to do that.
- Please.

1390
01:59:03,204 --> 01:59:05,206
- What did you take?
- Nothing.

1391
01:59:05,206 --> 01:59:06,540
I didn't take anything.

1392
01:59:06,540 --> 01:59:09,293
You steal from us? You little bastard.

1393
01:59:10,586 --> 01:59:12,588
Now you boys know you can't come in my

1394
01:59:12,546 --> 01:59:14,548
neighborhood without asking politely.

1395
01:59:19,971 --> 01:59:24,224
Never steal anything from
someone you can't outrun, kid!

1396
01:59:29,439 --> 01:59:33,151
You're pretty generous for a thief!

1397
01:59:40,365 --> 01:59:43,326
- I thought they killed you.
- Not yet.

1398
01:59:43,284 --> 01:59:47,705
- If you're expecting an apology...
- It wouldn't suit you.

1399
01:59:47,664 --> 01:59:49,290
I need your help.

1400
01:59:49,249 --> 01:59:53,336
- And why would I help you?
- For this. ' Clean Slate '.

1401
01:59:53,295 --> 01:59:57,757
You trust me with that,
after what I did to you?

1402
01:59:57,716 --> 02:00:00,760
I admit I was a little let down.

1403
02:00:02,094 --> 02:00:03,971
But I still think there's more to you.

1404
02:00:03,929 --> 02:00:07,016
In fact, I think that for
you, this isn't just a tool.

1405
02:00:07,016 --> 02:00:11,230
It's an escape, right, you want
to disappear, start fresh.

1406
02:00:11,188 --> 02:00:13,023
I can't even get off this island.

1407
02:00:12,981 --> 02:00:15,984
I could give you a way off once
you to get me to Lucius Fox.

1408
02:00:15,984 --> 02:00:19,946
I need you to find out where they're
holding him and take me in.

1409
02:00:22,407 --> 02:00:24,868
- Why do you need Fox?
- To save the city.

1410
02:00:24,868 --> 02:00:28,246
Who says it needs saving?
Maybe I like it this way.

1411
02:00:28,204 --> 02:00:30,874
Maybe you do.

1412
02:00:30,874 --> 02:00:34,252
But tomorrow that bomb is going off.

1413
02:00:35,836 --> 02:00:39,006
Get your powerful friend on the case?

1414
02:00:39,006 --> 02:00:41,342
I'm trying, but I need Fox.

1415
02:00:41,384 --> 02:00:45,513
Once it approaches, flick the switch.

1416
02:00:45,513 --> 02:00:48,056
The needle hits 200, you
give me the signal.

1417
02:00:48,056 --> 02:00:49,724
I'll will mark truck. Okay?

1418
02:00:50,517 --> 02:00:52,103
Heads up! Heads up!

1419
02:01:07,701 --> 02:01:10,204
- I got it!
- Mercenaries at your 6.

1420
02:01:10,496 --> 02:01:14,040
Stand still! Keep your hands
where we can see them!

1421
02:01:15,625 --> 02:01:18,378
Commissioner Gordon, you're under arrest.

1422
02:01:18,336 --> 02:01:19,629
On who's authority?

1423
02:01:19,629 --> 02:01:21,840
People of Gotham.

1424
02:01:21,798 --> 02:01:26,928
No lawyer. No witnesses. What
sort of due process is this?

1425
02:01:26,845 --> 02:01:30,556
You guilt have been determined. This
is merely a sentencing hearing.

1426
02:01:30,556 --> 02:01:32,975
Now what will it be?

1427
02:01:32,975 --> 02:01:35,937
Death or exile?

1428
02:01:35,979 --> 02:01:41,068
Crane, if you think we're going
out on to that ice willingly,

1429
02:01:41,026 --> 02:01:43,695
you have another think coming.

1430
02:01:44,947 --> 02:01:47,825
- Death then.
- Looks that way.

1431
02:01:47,783 --> 02:01:51,244
Very well. Death!

1432
02:01:51,786 --> 02:01:54,247
By exile.

1433
02:01:55,957 --> 02:01:58,418
Bring her to me!

1434
02:02:04,465 --> 02:02:06,466
Hey. Going down. Get things ready.

1435
02:02:06,466 --> 02:02:08,468
Let's gear on.

1436
02:02:15,558 --> 02:02:17,562
Spot this one on the spot.
Got a big day tomorrow.

1437
02:02:17,645 --> 02:02:20,439
We all do. Not every day
you bag Bruce Wayne!

1438
02:02:23,067 --> 02:02:24,694
- Bruce?
- You okay?

1439
02:02:24,694 --> 02:02:27,070
You pick the hell of time to
go on vacation, Mr. Wayne.

1440
02:02:27,070 --> 02:02:28,864
How long until that core ignites?

1441
02:02:28,822 --> 02:02:30,699
That bomb goes off in 12 hours.

1442
02:02:30,699 --> 02:02:33,368
Unless we can reconnect it to the reactor.

1443
02:02:33,327 --> 02:02:37,122
- Can you get Miranda out of here?
- Not tonight. I'm sorry.

1444
02:02:37,081 --> 02:02:39,917
- Do what's necessary.
- Tonight I need you.

1445
02:02:39,875 --> 02:02:42,169
- What for?
- To get me back in the game.

1446
02:02:42,127 --> 02:02:47,215
Sorry to spoil things boys but
they want these guys to himself.

1447
02:02:48,591 --> 02:02:51,761
- I won't forget about you, Miranda!
- I know.

1448
02:03:00,605 --> 02:03:04,191
- I like your girlfriend, Mr. Wayne!
- He should be so lucky.

1449
02:03:10,404 --> 02:03:15,243
Any move I make on Bane or the
bomb, the trigger-man sets it off.

1450
02:03:15,201 --> 02:03:18,246
But they won't use radio or
cell, too much interference.

1451
02:03:18,246 --> 02:03:20,038
Infrared doesn't have the range.

1452
02:03:20,038 --> 02:03:22,916
It'll have to be a micro burst, long-range.

1453
02:03:22,874 --> 02:03:24,710
- Could you block it?
- Yes.

1454
02:03:24,710 --> 02:03:28,881
But I need the EMP canon
guidance mounted on the Bat.

1455
02:03:28,839 --> 02:03:31,383
Remember where you're parked?

1456
02:03:45,231 --> 02:03:48,651
- Does it fly okay?
- Yeah.

1457
02:03:49,068 --> 02:03:51,571
Even without the autopilot. Thanks.

1458
02:03:51,529 --> 02:03:54,240
Autopilot? That's what you're there for.

1459
02:04:33,068 --> 02:04:35,696
Thing's clear. Come on, quick! No time.

1460
02:04:45,748 --> 02:04:47,250
Lock it up!

1461
02:04:51,628 --> 02:04:53,380
Who are you?

1462
02:05:21,909 --> 02:05:23,953
Light it up!

1463
02:05:40,885 --> 02:05:42,887
Mom check it out.

1464
02:05:43,137 --> 02:05:45,014
Honey, take a look!

1465
02:05:54,024 --> 02:05:56,318
Impossible!

1466
02:05:57,110 --> 02:06:01,281
Keep her close! He'll come for her.

1467
02:06:01,239 --> 02:06:05,326
- Where's Miranda Tate?
- Bane took her.

1468
02:06:05,284 --> 02:06:08,788
He's hold up at city hall,
surrounded by his army.

1469
02:06:08,746 --> 02:06:11,207
This blocks servo-detonator
signal to the bomb.

1470
02:06:11,165 --> 02:06:13,668
Get it on to it before sunrise.

1471
02:06:13,626 --> 02:06:16,003
If I hit the button when it starts.

1472
02:06:16,003 --> 02:06:18,840
- When what starts?
- War.

1473
02:06:54,583 --> 02:06:55,751
You missed this spy.

1474
02:06:58,837 --> 02:07:02,006
If you're working alone, wear a mask!

1475
02:07:02,006 --> 02:07:04,425
I'm not afraid of being seen
standing up against these guys.

1476
02:07:04,383 --> 02:07:07,970
The mask is not for you, it's to
protect the people you care about.

1477
02:07:08,888 --> 02:07:11,724
Count to five and throw.

1478
02:07:21,568 --> 02:07:24,446
Hey no offense, but you got
something bigger in that belt?

1479
02:07:34,122 --> 02:07:37,041
- What now?
- All out assault on Bane.

1480
02:07:37,041 --> 02:07:39,835
But you need to get
people across the bridge.

1481
02:07:39,835 --> 02:07:40,544
Why?

1482
02:07:40,503 --> 02:07:45,174
In case we fail. Leave an exodus.
Save as many lives as you can.

1483
02:07:45,133 --> 02:07:49,679
- You don't need me here?
- You've given me an army. Now, go!

1484
02:07:49,929 --> 02:07:52,765
- Hey, thanks!
- Don't thank me yet.

1485
02:07:52,724 --> 02:07:56,018
Well I might not get the chance later.

1486
02:08:08,489 --> 02:08:09,949
You shouldn't have.

1487
02:08:11,116 --> 02:08:13,576
The main town tunnel is blocked by debris.

1488
02:08:13,535 --> 02:08:16,871
But the canon have enough fire
power to make a path for people.

1489
02:08:16,830 --> 02:08:18,623
Wait until the fighting begins!

1490
02:08:18,581 --> 02:08:21,877
You're gonna wage your word to
save your stuck up girlfriend?

1491
02:08:21,877 --> 02:08:24,212
To start it, throttle.

1492
02:08:24,212 --> 02:08:25,422
I got it.

1493
02:08:25,422 --> 02:08:27,841
We have 45 minutes to save the city.

1494
02:08:27,799 --> 02:08:30,926
No. I've got 45 minutes to get
clear of the blast radius.

1495
02:08:30,926 --> 02:08:32,970
Because you don't stand a
chance against these guys.

1496
02:08:32,970 --> 02:08:34,013
With your help, I might.

1497
02:08:34,222 --> 02:08:37,099
I'll open that tunnel, but then I'm gone.

1498
02:08:37,099 --> 02:08:40,646
There's more to you than that.

1499
02:08:42,731 --> 02:08:46,026
Sorry to keep letting you down.

1500
02:08:48,362 --> 02:08:53,658
Come with me! Save yourself!

1501
02:08:54,951 --> 02:09:00,207
You don't owe these people anymore.
You've given them everything.

1502
02:09:00,165 --> 02:09:04,002
Not everything. Not yet.

1503
02:09:43,124 --> 02:09:47,585
Disperse! Disperse or be fired upon!

1504
02:09:48,378 --> 02:09:51,298
There's only one police in this town,

1505
02:10:29,251 --> 02:10:31,253
Open fire!

1506
02:11:21,761 --> 02:11:23,847
- Here it comes.
- Get ready!

1507
02:11:52,916 --> 02:11:57,504
So you came back to die with your city!

1508
02:11:57,421 --> 02:12:01,467
No. I came back to stop you.

1509
02:12:12,352 --> 02:12:13,436
Now!

1510
02:12:26,242 --> 02:12:27,327
That's impossible.

1511
02:12:29,161 --> 02:12:31,121
Come over the fifth!

1512
02:12:45,593 --> 02:12:49,555
Oh, hang up. Get on the bus, go ahead.
You come with me! You too!

1513
02:12:49,513 --> 02:12:52,892
Hey you, you and you, come here!

1514
02:12:52,850 --> 02:12:54,810
Everyone else get on the bus! Okay.

1515
02:12:54,768 --> 02:12:57,814
You guys, you're going to knock on
doors and spread the word okay.

1516
02:12:57,773 --> 02:13:00,901
The bomb is gonna go off. Then get
out by the south Street tunnel,

1517
02:13:00,901 --> 02:13:02,027
or over the bridge.

1518
02:13:02,027 --> 02:13:06,239
You go, you do two blocks, you get
back to the bus. Alright? Go! Go!

1519
02:13:06,989 --> 02:13:11,160
- Is he back?
- Keep your eyes open. Go!

1520
02:14:32,407 --> 02:14:34,576
Cover the doors!

1521
02:14:37,286 --> 02:14:40,414
Where's your trigger? Where is it?

1522
02:14:41,457 --> 02:14:44,836
You never gave it to any ordinary citizen.

1523
02:14:44,794 --> 02:14:47,422
Where is it? Where's the trigger?

1524
02:14:47,714 --> 02:14:50,466
Where is it?

1525
02:14:58,599 --> 02:15:02,102
Tell me where the trigger is.

1526
02:15:02,102 --> 02:15:04,940
Then, you have my permission to die.

1527
02:15:16,783 --> 02:15:21,872
I broke you. How did you come back?

1528
02:15:21,830 --> 02:15:26,168
You think you're the only one who
could learn the strength to escape?

1529
02:15:26,126 --> 02:15:30,797
- Where's the trigger?
- But I never escaped.

1530
02:15:31,506 --> 02:15:33,925
But the child,

1531
02:15:34,759 --> 02:15:37,387
the child of Ra's Al Ghul's,
who made the climb.

1532
02:15:37,387 --> 02:15:40,640
But he's not the child of Ra's Al Ghul.

1533
02:15:43,268 --> 02:15:45,186
I am.

1534
02:15:45,145 --> 02:15:50,942
Although I'm not ordinary, I'm a citizen.

1535
02:16:09,919 --> 02:16:11,420
Miranda?

1536
02:16:13,798 --> 02:16:15,174
Why?

1537
02:16:15,466 --> 02:16:21,096
Thalia. My mother named me
Thalia before she was killed.

1538
02:16:21,054 --> 02:16:27,018
The way I would have been killed
if not for my protector, Bane.

1539
02:16:34,568 --> 02:16:35,694
Good bye.

1540
02:16:37,780 --> 02:16:40,741
I climbed out of the pit.

1541
02:16:45,704 --> 02:16:48,248
I found my father

1542
02:16:50,333 --> 02:16:54,254
and brought him back to
exact terrible vengeance.

1543
02:16:54,212 --> 02:16:56,256
But by that time,

1544
02:16:56,340 --> 02:17:01,345
the prisoners and the doctor
had their work to my friend,

1545
02:17:01,303 --> 02:17:02,554
my protector.

1546
02:17:06,307 --> 02:17:13,232
The League took us in and trained us
but my father could not accept Bane.

1547
02:17:13,148 --> 02:17:17,236
He saw only a monster, whose very existence

1548
02:17:17,194 --> 02:17:21,364
was the reminder of the hell
he'd left his wife to die in.

1549
02:17:21,323 --> 02:17:24,701
He excommunicated Bane from
the League of Shadows.

1550
02:17:24,659 --> 02:17:29,955
His only crime was that he loved me.

1551
02:17:31,123 --> 02:17:34,835
I could not forgive my father,

1552
02:17:38,422 --> 02:17:40,966
until you murdered him.

1553
02:17:57,816 --> 02:18:03,239
He was trying to kill
millions of innocent people.

1554
02:18:03,239 --> 02:18:08,369
Innocence is a strong word to
throw around Gotham, Bruce.

1555
02:18:09,703 --> 02:18:13,457
I honor my father by finishing his work.

1556
02:18:24,676 --> 02:18:27,346
Vengeance against the man who killed

1557
02:18:27,346 --> 02:18:30,349
him is simply a reward for my patience.

1558
02:18:31,308 --> 02:18:32,601
You see?

1559
02:18:33,519 --> 02:18:38,607
It's the slow knife. The
knife that takes its time.

1560
02:18:41,567 --> 02:18:47,198
The knife that waits
years, without forgetting,

1561
02:18:47,157 --> 02:18:51,619
then slips quietly between the bones,

1562
02:18:51,578 --> 02:18:56,081
that's the knife that cuts the deepest.

1563
02:18:56,123 --> 02:18:57,875
Please!

1564
02:19:04,674 --> 02:19:08,594
Maybe that knife was too slow.

1565
02:19:08,594 --> 02:19:10,638
The truck is under attacked.

1566
02:19:10,638 --> 02:19:14,057
Gordon. You gave him a
way to block my signal

1567
02:19:14,349 --> 02:19:16,309
No matter.

1568
02:19:18,103 --> 02:19:21,149
He's bought Gotham 11 minutes.

1569
02:19:24,777 --> 02:19:26,780
Come on!

1570
02:19:33,702 --> 02:19:35,746
Stay back! What are you doing?

1571
02:19:35,704 --> 02:19:39,291
Wait. MCU, I'm getting
these boys to safety.

1572
02:19:39,250 --> 02:19:41,210
You're going to get us all killed.

1573
02:19:41,210 --> 02:19:44,338
Anyone crosses this bridge,
they'll blow up the city.

1574
02:19:44,297 --> 02:19:47,466
It's gonna blow anyway. We
need to open this bridge, now!

1575
02:19:47,466 --> 02:19:51,219
Detective, if you take one step
forward, we will shoot you!

1576
02:19:51,178 --> 02:19:54,972
If you take two steps forward,
we will blow the bridge.

1577
02:19:56,891 --> 02:20:00,436
Ok go back by the bus and wait for me alright!
Just go back and wait.

1578
02:20:03,357 --> 02:20:04,900
Prepare a convoy.

1579
02:20:04,858 --> 02:20:07,568
We must secure the bomb until it detonates!

1580
02:20:08,403 --> 02:20:13,867
Don't kill him. I want
him to feel the heat.

1581
02:20:13,867 --> 02:20:16,703
Feel the fire of 12 million souls.

1582
02:20:16,703 --> 02:20:17,996
You failed!

1583
02:20:23,543 --> 02:20:26,128
Good bye, my friend!

1584
02:20:35,179 --> 02:20:38,599
Keep moving forward!
Plague them in the stairs!

1585
02:20:46,774 --> 02:20:48,151
Shoot them!

1586
02:20:49,068 --> 02:20:50,903
Shoot them all!

1587
02:20:59,829 --> 02:21:03,624
We both know that I have to kill you now.

1588
02:21:06,084 --> 02:21:08,962
You'll just have to imagine the fire.

1589
02:21:16,219 --> 02:21:18,597
About the whole no guns thing,

1590
02:21:18,597 --> 02:21:22,600
I'm not sure I feel as
strongly about it as you do.

1591
02:21:35,322 --> 02:21:36,532
Pull up!

1592
02:21:39,701 --> 02:21:41,369
Stay level.

1593
02:21:53,506 --> 02:21:57,092
We have to force the convoyees
to the entrance of the reactor.

1594
02:21:58,385 --> 02:22:01,639
I need you underground.
I'll be in the air. Go!

1595
02:22:01,597 --> 02:22:05,559
The situation has changed!
Your orders are out of date.

1596
02:22:05,518 --> 02:22:09,647
I'm a cop like you and
I'm walking out there.

1597
02:22:09,605 --> 02:22:12,985
Please do not shoot me!

1598
02:22:14,026 --> 02:22:15,528
Shoot at his feet.

1599
02:22:24,870 --> 02:22:27,372
Nothing like a little air superiority.

1600
02:22:27,372 --> 02:22:32,794
Detective, please stop!
Please, detective! Stop!

1601
02:22:32,752 --> 02:22:38,591
Stop walking! Blow it! Do it!

1602
02:22:49,936 --> 02:22:53,439
You have to get that bomb here,
and you've got ten minutes.

1603
02:23:02,950 --> 02:23:05,786
They're pushing us to the
entrance of the reactor!

1604
02:23:05,786 --> 02:23:08,205
They're gonna try to reconnect the core.

1605
02:23:08,205 --> 02:23:10,206
Idiots!

1606
02:23:10,915 --> 02:23:16,713
You sons-of-bitches! You killed them.
To follow your orders!

1607
02:23:17,046 --> 02:23:19,215
Alright boys get into
circle, bow your heads.

1608
02:23:21,384 --> 02:23:23,053
It's on my side.

1609
02:24:11,266 --> 02:24:13,685
My father, these guys will
go back on the bus. Okay?

1610
02:24:13,685 --> 02:24:15,186
Go! Go! Go! Back in the bus.

1611
02:24:15,186 --> 02:24:18,106
There's no where to go!

1612
02:24:18,106 --> 02:24:19,942
On the bus!

1613
02:25:15,288 --> 02:25:18,665
You've got to turn the truck East!

1614
02:25:22,336 --> 02:25:23,837
Stay straight!

1615
02:25:55,534 --> 02:25:58,871
Give me a hand! We can get a cable on it!

1616
02:26:05,545 --> 02:26:09,632
Fox showed me how to override the reactor.

1617
02:26:12,009 --> 02:26:13,635
Oh dear.

1618
02:26:16,889 --> 02:26:20,434
Including the emergency flood.

1619
02:26:36,659 --> 02:26:43,666
There's no way this bomb will be stopped.

1620
02:26:43,791 --> 02:26:45,209
What are you doing?

1621
02:26:45,376 --> 02:26:46,502
Protection from the blast!

1622
02:26:46,502 --> 02:26:48,129
We're gonna be alright! Get on top! Go!

1623
02:26:48,087 --> 02:26:49,212
It's an atom bomb!

1624
02:26:49,171 --> 02:26:50,922
You think they need to hear that right now?

1625
02:26:50,922 --> 02:26:52,674
To watch let them die without hope?
Come on!

1626
02:26:53,008 --> 02:26:55,844
Prepare yourself.

1627
02:26:55,844 --> 02:27:01,934
My father's work is done.

1628
02:27:07,020 --> 02:27:10,108
- What are you doing?
- I can get it out over the bay.

1629
02:27:10,108 --> 02:27:14,112
- Set it to fly over water and eject?
- No autopilot.

1630
02:27:16,031 --> 02:27:19,451
You could've gone anywhere, did
anything but you came back here.

1631
02:27:19,409 --> 02:27:23,663
- So did you.
- I guess we're both suckers.

1632
02:27:30,544 --> 02:27:33,589
- I never cared who you were.
- And you were right.

1633
02:27:33,547 --> 02:27:36,217
Shouldn't the people know
the hero who saved them?

1634
02:27:36,175 --> 02:27:37,510
Hero can be anyone.

1635
02:27:37,468 --> 02:27:40,221
Even a man knowing something as simple

1636
02:27:40,179 --> 02:27:43,057
and reassuring as putting
a coat around a young boy

1637
02:27:43,057 --> 02:27:46,310
shoulders to let him know
the world hadn't ended.

1638
02:28:03,702 --> 02:28:05,538
Bruce Wayne?

1639
02:28:19,051 --> 02:28:21,761
Vlad, they go! Go, you too! Come on father.

1640
02:28:40,530 --> 02:28:42,740
Hey heads down! This is it!

1641
02:28:44,534 --> 02:28:46,327
No! That's Batman!

1642
02:29:33,164 --> 02:29:35,083
That's detonation!

1643
02:29:42,090 --> 02:29:45,010
It's out over the bay,
it's clear of the city.

1644
02:30:03,570 --> 02:30:06,198
' I see a beautiful city '

1645
02:30:06,156 --> 02:30:11,536
' and the brilliant people
rising from this abyss. '

1646
02:30:11,494 --> 02:30:16,207
' I see the lives, for
which I lay down my life.'

1647
02:30:16,166 --> 02:30:22,255
' Peaceful, useful, prosperous and happy. '

1648
02:30:23,840 --> 02:30:28,302
' I see that I hold a
sanctuary in their hearts '

1649
02:30:28,928 --> 02:30:32,264
' And in the hearts of their descendents. '

1650
02:30:33,140 --> 02:30:35,560
' Generations ends. '

1651
02:30:37,686 --> 02:30:41,857
' That is the far, far
better thing that I do... '

1652
02:30:42,774 --> 02:30:45,153
'... than I have ever done. '

1653
02:30:45,153 --> 02:30:49,907
'That is a far, far better
rest that I go to...'

1654
02:30:52,826 --> 02:30:55,662
'... than I have ever known. '

1655
02:31:13,054 --> 02:31:17,225
I'm so sorry. I failed you!

1656
02:31:18,310 --> 02:31:20,520
You trusted me...

1657
02:31:21,396 --> 02:31:23,773
And I failed you.

1658
02:31:26,235 --> 02:31:29,279
Can I change your mind,

1659
02:31:30,823 --> 02:31:33,450
about quitting the force?

1660
02:31:33,409 --> 02:31:37,663
You know what you said about the
structures becoming shackles.

1661
02:31:37,621 --> 02:31:41,499
You were right and I can't
take it, the injustice.

1662
02:31:43,084 --> 02:31:46,004
I mean, no one ever's gonna
know who saved the entire city.

1663
02:31:45,962 --> 02:31:48,173
They know.

1664
02:31:49,049 --> 02:31:51,759
It was the Batman.

1665
02:32:08,483 --> 02:32:12,655
Mr. Wayne's will was not amended
to reflect his more modest estate.

1666
02:32:12,613 --> 02:32:15,616
Nonetheless, there are
considerable assets to dispose of.

1667
02:32:15,575 --> 02:32:19,620
The contents of the house are to be
sold to settle the estate's accounts,

1668
02:32:19,578 --> 02:32:24,583
and the remainders left in its
entirety to Alfred J. Pennyworth.

1669
02:32:25,667 --> 02:32:29,755
The house and grounds are left to
the city of Gotham on condition

1670
02:32:29,713 --> 02:32:33,759
that they never be demolished, altered
or otherwise interfered with.

1671
02:32:33,759 --> 02:32:38,722
That they shall be used for one
purpose and one purpose only:

1672
02:32:39,597 --> 02:32:44,394
The housing and care of the city's
at risk and orphan children.

1673
02:32:44,352 --> 02:32:46,396
I'm a clerk and I'll help anyone with

1674
02:32:46,354 --> 02:32:49,024
the smaller correspondences
and instructions.

1675
02:32:48,982 --> 02:32:51,778
- Blake, John?
- Nothing here.

1676
02:32:51,778 --> 02:32:52,904
Alright,

1677
02:32:52,904 --> 02:32:54,738
Try my legal name.

1678
02:32:57,366 --> 02:33:01,202
You should use your full name.
I like that name, Robin.

1679
02:33:01,202 --> 02:33:02,411
Thanks!

1680
02:33:02,411 --> 02:33:04,539
Why are we even worrying about
stabilization software?

1681
02:33:04,497 --> 02:33:06,874
This entire autopilot system
is completely obsolete.

1682
02:33:06,833 --> 02:33:10,795
Please, I just need to know
what I could've done to fix it.

1683
02:33:10,753 --> 02:33:14,923
But Mr. Fox it's already been fixed,
software patch, six months ago.

1684
02:33:14,882 --> 02:33:17,551
Check The ID on the patch.

1685
02:33:19,511 --> 02:33:21,597
Bruce Wayne.

1686
02:33:21,597 --> 02:33:24,516
- Any news on the missing item?
- Not yet.

1687
02:33:24,475 --> 02:33:26,143
We'd better leave no stone unturned,

1688
02:33:26,227 --> 02:33:29,355
we can't leave a string of
pearls on the manifest as lost.
