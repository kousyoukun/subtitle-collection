1
00:00:01,930 --> 00:00:04,590
我相信Harvey Dent.
I believed in Harvey Dent.

2
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:24,990
-Pavel博士 我是CIA -他不是一個人
- Dr. Pavel, I'm CIA. - He wasn't alone.

3
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:29,380
-你不能帶朋友陪同 -他們不是我朋友
- You don't get to bring friends. - There are not my friends.

4
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:33,080
-別擔心 不收你錢 -我為什麼要帶上他們
- Don't worry no charge for them. - And why would I want them?

5
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:35,590
他們能抬高你的身價
They were trying to up your price.

6
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:39,690
他們是給那個僱傭兵賣命的 那個面具人
They work for the mercenary, a masked man.

7
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:42,160
Bane
Bane?

8
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,160
帶他們登機 我會向上級匯報的
Get them on board. I'll call them in.

9
00:00:53,650 --> 00:00:55,980
我剛向局裡提交了引渡計劃
The flight plan I just filed the agency,

10
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:59,520
名單只有我 我手下 Pavel博士
list me, my man, Dr Pavel here

11
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:02,100
和你們其中一個
but only one of you.

12
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:09,950
第一個開口說話的可以留在飛機上
The first one to talk get to stay on my aircraft.

13
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:20,430
誰指使你去綁架Pavel博士的
Who paid you to grab Dr. Pavel?

14
00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:29,740
他飛得不夠漂亮啊 下一個誰來 
He didn't fly so good, who wants to try next?

15
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:35,170
跟我說說Bane 為什麼他要帶面具
Tell me about Bane! Why does he wear a mask?

16
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:39,390
作為跑腿小弟你也太忠心耿耿了吧
A lot of loyalty for a hired gun!

17
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,820
也許他好奇為什麼有人把他扔下飛機前
Or perhaps he was wondering why someone would shoot a man

18
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:46,590
還想射死他
before throwing him out of the plane.

19
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:53,500
終於有人開口了 你是誰
At least you can talk. Who are you?

20
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,420
我們是誰不重要
It doesn't matter who we are.

21
00:01:56,490 --> 00:01:59,550
我們的計劃才重要
What matters is our plan.

22
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:09,290
我戴面具之前 從沒有人關心我是誰
No one cared who I was until I put on the mask.

23
00:02:09,890 --> 00:02:12,280
-我摘掉你的面具 你會死麼
- If I pulled that off, will you die?

24
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:14,490
-會疼死人的
- It will be extremely painful ...

25
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:17,290
-你還會怕痛?  -我是怕你痛啊
- You're a big guy. - ... For you.

26
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:23,390
被捕也是你的計劃麼
Was getting caught part of your plan?

27
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:25,480
當然了
Of course.

28
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:33,280
Pavel博士拒絕了我們的條件 卻接受了你的
Dr Pavel refused that offer in favour of yours.

29
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:35,170
我們必須要知道他都跟你說了些什麼
We had to find out what he told you.

30
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:38,000
沒有 我什麼都沒說
Nothing! I said nothing!

31
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:53,750
那恭喜啊 你被捕了
Congratulations! You got yourself caught!

32
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:54,610
長官
Sir ...

33
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,500
你驚天計劃的下一步是什麼呢
Now what's the next step of your master plan?

34
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,400
飛機墜毀
Crashing this plane ...

35
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:07,300
無人生還
...with no survivors.

36
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:31,560
求救 求救
Mayday! Mayday!

37
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,630
不
No!

38
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:42,510
他們希望我們中有一個人能遇難 兄弟
They expect one of us in the wreck, brother.

39
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:48,800
-火點燃了嗎  -是的 烈火已經開始燃燒
- Did we started the fire? - Yes. The fire rises.

40
00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:01,600
冷靜點 博士 這還不是害怕的時候呢
Calm down, doctor. Now this is not the time for fear.

41
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:04,240
現在才是
That comes later.

42
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:34,350
Harvey Dent日也許不是我們最古老的節日
Harvey Dent's day may not be our oldest holiday

43
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:37,580
我們今日相聚 卻是因為他是最重要的
but we're here tonight because it's one the most important.

44
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:41,780
Harvey Dent對於犯罪分子毫不妥協的立場
Harvey Dent's uncompromising stand against organized crime.

45
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,020
使哥譚市的治安
It made Gotham a safer

46
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:45,250
從他去世那一年開始好轉
place than it was at the time of his death,

47
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:46,150
8年前
eight years ago.

48
00:05:46,170 --> 00:05:49,150
這座城見證了歷史性的轉折
This city has seen a historical turn around

49
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:51,740
天下無城不惡 但這裡卻靜若天堂
No city is without crime but this city is

50
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:53,860
靜若天堂 正是因為
without organized crime because of

51
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,380
Dent的行為 才使得
the Dent's act gave law

52
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:58,470
法律有了粉碎犯罪集團的利齒
enforcement teeth in it's fight against the Mafia.

53
00:05:58,570 --> 00:06:02,140
近日 有人開始發表意見說要廢除Dent法案
Now people are talking about repealing the Dent's act

54
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:06,070
我也要發表意見 只要我在就別想
and to them I'll say not on my watch.

55
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,550
要感謝Wayne基金主持這次盛會
I want to thank Wayne Foundation for hosting this event.

56
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:12,050
我聽聞今晚Wayne先生不能前來
Now I'm told that Mr. Wayne couldn't be here tonight,

57
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:13,910
但我相信 精神上他與我們同在
but I'm sure that he's with us in spirit.

58
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:16,780
現在 我要發表重要講話
and now, I'm going to give away to an important voice ...

59
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:19,220
最近有人見過Wayne麼
Who can lay eyes on Wayne these days?

60
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:21,280
沒 好幾年都沒見過了
No one has, not in years.

61
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:25,410
人們對這個面具和斗篷下的殺人狂徒抱有信仰
People put in faith in a murderous thug in a mask and a cape.

62
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:28,940
一個最終露出真面目的狂徒
A thug who shows his true nature when

63
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:30,890
一個最終背叛偉大的Dent
he betrayed the trust of

64
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:34,630
並極度殘忍將其殺害的狂徒
this great man and murdered him in cold blood.

65
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,370
可人兒 幹嘛急著送飯
Sweetheart, what's so fast with the chow?

66
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:38,180
蝦球
Shrimp balls?

67
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:40,680
-Jim Gordon 能告訴你Harvey Dent的真相 -謝謝
-Jim Gordon can tell you the truth about Harvey Dent -Thank you

68
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,900
還是由他自己講述吧 有請Gordon警長
Let him tell you himself. Commissioner Gordon!

69
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,580
真相就是
The truth ...

70
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:09,800
我準備了Harvey Dent事件真相的發言稿
I have... A speech telling the truth about Harvey Dent.

71
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:16,760
只是 或許時機未到
Maybe the time isn't right.

72
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:22,320
或許 現在
Maybe right now...

73
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:24,510
你們只需要知道
All you need to know is that ...

74
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:27,890
黑門監獄收押的千名罪犯
there are one thousand inmates in Blackgate Prison

75
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:30,130
都是Dent法案的結果
as a direct result of the Dent's act.

76
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:32,010
那些暴力罪犯
These are violent criminals

77
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:35,120
犯罪集團的主力打手
essential thugs in the organized crime machine.

78
00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:37,280
也許 我應該說
Maybe, for now I should say

79
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:40,630
Harvey Dent並沒有
about the death of Harvey Dent's is this...

80
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:47,210
白白犧牲
It has not been for nothing.

81
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:49,490
你見過這房子的主人麼
Did you see the guy who owns the house?

82
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:51,790
沒 我聽說他從來沒出過東樓
No. I heard he never leaves the east wing.

83
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,930
你知道麼 我聽說他出了車禍
You know, I heard he had an accident.

84
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:55,530
是哦 怪不得會毀容
Yeah that he's disfigured ...

85
00:07:55,630 --> 00:08:01,580
Till先生 為什麼你的人會佔用主樓梯
Mr. Till! Why are your people using the main staircase?

86
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,460
-還有 Bolton小姐在哪裡 -她在吧檯 先生 我能效勞麼
- And where is Mrs. Bolton? - She's at the bar, sir. Can I help?

87
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:08,230
去東樓
Get to the east wing.

88
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:10,650
打開門 把托盤放在桌子上
Unlock door, put the tray on the table,

89
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:12,090
再把門鎖上
and lock the door again.

90
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:13,390
就這些
Nothing more.

91
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:20,130
真是抱歉 Tate小姐 我通報了可是先生不願意見您
I'm sorry, Miss Tate. I tried but he won't see you.

92
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:22,290
你呀 別難過 他不是針對你一個
You know, you mustn't take it personally.

93
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:25,090
大家都知道Wayne獨自躲在裡面
Everyone knows that Wayne is hold up in there with

94
00:08:25,170 --> 00:08:28,100
用幾年沒剪過的8寸長指甲給孩子疊衣服呢
8 inch nails paving into mason's jar

95
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:30,600
讓我等這麼久 你真是太好了
It's very good of you to let me on the ground.

96
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:45,750
你幹嘛要浪費時間在
Why are you wasting your time trying to talk

97
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:48,400
一個把你的投資花在
to a man who throw away your investment

98
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:51,180
拯救世界的面子工程上的人
on some save the world vanity project?

99
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,770
他不能給你賺錢 我能
He can't get your money back, I can.

100
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:57,190
我可以花時間給你解釋拯救世界的企劃案
I could try explaining that the save the world project,

101
00:08:57,340 --> 00:09:01,120
賺不賺錢 都是值得投資的 Daggett先生
vain or not, is worth investing in, Mr. Daggett.

102
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:04,650
但你只懂得錢和權的附屬品
But you understand only money and the power you think it buys.

103
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:08,170
那我幹嘛要浪費時間呢 真是的
So why waste my time, indeed?

104
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09,850
二次報告移交完畢
Second report shift report's in,

105
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:12,480
你應該跟市長多打交道
You should spend some time with the mayor.

106
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,190
那是你的事
Well that's your department.

107
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:16,620
有人給他看過犯罪統計麼
Did anyone shows him the crime stats?

108
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:17,790
他一向相信直覺的
He goes by his guts,

109
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:20,100
不管犯罪率是多少他都放不下心來
and it continue to bothers him no matter what the numbers.

110
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,600
他老婆肯定愛死他了
Must be popular with his wife.

111
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:24,210
才不是呢 他老婆帶著孩子回克利夫蘭娘家去了
Not really. she took the kids and left for Cleveland.

112
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:25,920
我們有的是時間干他的活
We have plenty of time for visits.

113
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:28,210
市長春天就會炒了他
The Mayor going to dump him in the spring.

114
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:31,410
真的麼 他可是個英雄啊
Really? But he's a hero.

115
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:34,100
天下太平 誰還需要英雄
War hero. This is peace time.

116
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,230
抱歉 抱歉
Sorry sorry.

117
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:09,160
我真的很抱歉 Wayne先生
I'm so terribly sorry, Mr. Wayne!

118
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:12,840
是Wayne先生 對麼 
It is Mr. Wayne, isn't it?

119
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:20,030
雖然先生你沒有8寸長甲 也沒有明顯的疤痕
Although you don't have long nails or facial scars sir...

120
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:23,280
外面都是這麼說我的麼
That's what they say about me?

121
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:26,670
都是因為 沒人見得到你
Because you know, no one ever sees you.

122
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:28,200
你項鏈很漂亮嘛
That's a beautiful necklace!

123
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,740
讓我想起我媽媽的那一條
Reminds me of one that belongs to my mother.

124
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:33,480
不會是同一條吧
It can't be the same one,

125
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:38,020
她的那條鎖在保險箱裡呢
because her Pearls are in the safe.

126
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:45,860
製造商說這可是無法破解的
The manufacturer clearly explained that it is uncrackable.

127
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:56,640
哎呀 沒人跟我說過他無法破解呀
Oops Nobody told me it was uncrackable.

128
00:10:56,780 --> 00:11:00,120
抱歉我恐怕不能讓你帶走它
I'm afraid I can't let you take those.

129
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:02,490
你不會打女人的
Look you wouldn't beat up a woman,

130
00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:04,850
而且 我也不打瘸子
anymore than I would beat up a cripple.

131
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:08,990
當然 偶爾也是會有例外的
Of course, sometimes exceptions have to be made.

132
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:16,540
晚安 Wayne先生
Good night, Mr. Wayne!

133
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:35,180
-能搭個便車麼 -正合我意
- Can I have a ride? - You read my mind!

134
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:37,230
走吧
Let's go!

135
00:11:37,370 --> 00:11:39,560
Tate小姐又來請求見面了
Ms. Tate was asking to see you again.

136
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:42,860
-她可真固執啊 -還很漂亮呢
- She's very persistent. - And quite lovely.

137
00:11:42,890 --> 00:11:45,090
-萬一你有興趣呢 -沒興趣
- In case you were wondering. - I wasn't.

138
00:11:45,190 --> 00:11:47,940
-你在幹嘛 -採集指紋
- What are you doing? - Examining print dust.

139
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:49,710
我們被搶了
We've been robbed.

140
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:52,960
誰讓你撤除警報系統的
And this your idea of unsounding the alarm, is it?

141
00:11:53,070 --> 00:11:55,170
她把項鏈偷了 追蹤裝置什麼的也都拿走了
She took pearls, tracking device and all.

142
00:11:55,270 --> 00:11:56,780
-她? -一個女傭
- She? - One of the maids.

143
00:11:56,870 --> 00:11:58,780
也許你該禁止她們來東樓
Perhaps you should stop letting them in this part of the house.

144
00:11:58,830 --> 00:12:02,320
也許你該學學自己鋪床
Perhaps you should start learning to make your own bed.

145
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:08,500
-為什麼要採集指紋呢 -不是我 是她在採集
- Why were you dusting for prints? - I wasn't. She does.

146
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:14,360
長官 Gilly議員的夫人一直打來說
Sir! Congressman Gilly's wife been calling

147
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:17,040
議員從Wayne基金的活動結束後
in apparently the congressman never made

148
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,300
就沒回過家
it home after the Wayne Foundation event.

149
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:21,310
現在的警察就只能幹這個了
That's the job for the police.

150
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:24,020
你跟Dent早就把烏煙瘴氣都掃乾淨了 
When you and Dent clean up the streets, you've cleaned them good.

151
00:12:24,130 --> 00:12:29,170
再過幾天我們該去追查圖書館過期借據了
Pretty soon we will be chasing down an over due library books.

152
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:35,260
但是 你仍然是一副身陷戰場的摸樣
and yet, here you're act like we're still at war.

153
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:38,080
-你叫什麼 孩子 -Blake 長官
- What's your name, son? - Blake, sir.

154
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:41,880
你有話想問我麼 Blake警員
You have something you want to ask me officer Blake?

155
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:43,850
是關於那一夜 8年前的今夜
It's about that night, this night,

156
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:45,790
Dent去世的那一夜
eight years ago, the night Dent died.

157
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:48,300
最後關於蝙蝠俠的聲明說
The last confirm sighting of The Batman.

158
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:51,050
他殺害了那麼多人 放倒了2梯隊特警
Who murders those people, takes down two SWAT teams,

159
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:55,380
擰斷了Dent的脖子 然後就 消失了
brakes Dent's neck and then just vanishes.

160
00:12:55,490 --> 00:12:57,940
我不懂你想問什麼
I'm not hearing the question.

161
00:12:58,030 --> 00:13:00,510
難道你不想知道他是誰麼
Don't you want to know who he was?

162
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:03,990
我非常清楚他是誰
I know exactly who he was.

163
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:07,020
他是蝙蝠俠
He was The Batman.

164
00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:12,600
我們去看看議員夫人吧
Let's go see about The Congressman's wife.

165
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:23,100
Wayne少爺
Master Wayne!

166
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:26,740
Wayne少爺
Master Wayne!

167
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,170
你已經很久沒下來過了
You haven't been down here in a long time.

168
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:01,850
我來找關於珠寶小賊的線索
I'm trying to finding more about our jewel thief.

169
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,300
我比對了她的指紋
I ran her prints.

170
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:05,340
除非她減肥過度了
Unless she loss a lot of weight,

171
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:08,790
她用的是別人的指紋
she was wearing someone else's fingerprints.

172
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:10,060
她不錯喲
She's good.

173
00:14:10,170 --> 00:14:13,380
她是不錯 但項鏈上 不是有追蹤器麼
She may be, but we a..Trace on the necklace.

174
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:16,360
有是有  我把去過的地方和警方
We do, so I cross reference the address she went back to,

175
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:19,290
高端盜竊組的資料做了交叉比對
with police data on high end thieves and these

176
00:14:19,410 --> 00:14:22,370
找到了Selina Kyle
and Selina Kyle.

177
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:24,500
她犯過不少事兒
Her database's are full

178
00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:27,850
但罪名從沒成立過
of close calls and tips around the fences.

179
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:31,760
她是不錯 但不巧她遇到我了 
She's good, but the ground is shrinking beneath her feet.

180
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:34,540
我們得在她把項鏈脫手之前報警啊
We should send the police before she fences her purposes.

181
00:14:34,570 --> 00:14:36,910
她不會脫手的 她太喜歡那條項鏈了
She won't. She likes it too much

182
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:39,060
而且項鏈並不是她的目的
and they weren't what she was after.

183
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:41,240
-她的目的是 -我的指紋
- What was she after? - My fingerprints.

184
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:44,470
她把打印碳粉混合了石墨塗在保險櫃上
It was printer toner mixed with graphite on the safe.

185
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:47,170
能得到完整指紋 而且無法追蹤
It gives you good pull and and it's untraceable.

186
00:14:47,270 --> 00:14:50,110
精彩 你們倆真該一起喝杯咖啡交換電話
Fascinating! You two should exchanging notes over coffee.

187
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:52,190
你想撮合我跟一個小偷
So you're trying to set me up with a jewel thief?

188
00:14:52,290 --> 00:14:54,340
要是有人能帶你回正常世界的話
At this point, I'd set you up with a chimpanzee,

189
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:57,150
就算是母猩猩我都願意撮合
if it'd bring you back to the world.

190
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:01,280
- 外面的世界已經不再屬於我了 -這正是問題所在
- There's nothing out there for me. - And that's the problem.

191
00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:04,030
你把戰服和面具高高掛起 但你卻無法繼續
You hung up your cape and your mask but you didn't move on.

192
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:06,770
你從未真正地生活過  你早晚有一天會
You never went to find a life, you'll find some how...

193
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:08,840
Alfred
Alfred ...

194
00:15:08,930 --> 00:15:10,980
我曾經擁有過
I did find someone.

195
00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:14,550
我知道 然後你又失去了一切 但生活就是如此 少爺
I know, and you lost them but that's all part of living sir.

196
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:17,170
但你並不是在生活 你只是在等待
But you're not living, you're just waiting,

197
00:15:17,170 --> 00:15:18,940
等著災難降臨
hoping things to go bad again.

198
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:20,470
記得你離開哥譚市那一次麼
Remember when you left Gotham?

199
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:23,440
那時還沒有這一切 還沒有蝙蝠俠
Before all this, before Batman,

200
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:25,480
你一走就是7年
You've been gone for seven years.

201
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:30,190
7年來我一直等你 希望你不再回來
Seven years I've waited hoping that you wouldn't come back.

202
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:32,600
每一年 我都給自己放假
Every year, I took a holiday.

203
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:36,310
去佛羅倫薩 阿爾諾河畔喝咖啡 
I went to Florence's cafe on the banks of the Arno.

204
00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:40,290
每一個良宵 我都坐下點一杯苦酒
Every fine evening, I'll sit there and ordered a Fernet Branca.

205
00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:43,340
幻想著
I had this fantasy..

206
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:47,160
我朝對面的桌子看過去
that I would look across the tables ...

207
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:49,350
在人群中看見了你
and I'll see you there ...

208
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:53,870
帶著妻子 或許還帶著孩子
... With a wife maybe a couple of kids.

209
00:15:54,690 --> 00:15:59,480
你我彼此不用言語
You won't say anything to me, nor me to you.

210
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:06,480
但我們都明白 你過得很好
But we both know that you made it, that you were happy.

211
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:13,620
我從沒希望你重新回到哥譚
I never wanted you to come back to Gotham.

212
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,060
我一直都清楚 這裡除了苦痛悲哀
I always know that there was nothing

213
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:18,610
再沒有什麼可以給你
else here for you except pain and tragedy

214
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:22,810
我希望你擁有得更多
and I wanted something more for you than that.

215
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,910
一直都希望
I still do.

216
00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:34,810
一個月大概出水兩次
It washed up here a couples of times a month

217
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:36,610
天越冷量越多
even more when it gets colder.

218
00:16:36,710 --> 00:16:38,600
寄居在下水道的流浪者
Homeless sheltering in the tunnels.

219
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:41,740
我們把他從水裡撈出來
We pulled him from the

220
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:44,700
就沒碰他了
base but other than that, we didn't touch it.

221
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:47,960
什麼
What?

222
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:50,080
他叫Jimmy 是St. Swithin收容所的
His name is Jimmy. He's from St. Swithin's.

223
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:54,520
他是我學校的孩子 我給他們隊當教練
He's the boy on my school. I coached the ball.

224
00:16:57,380 --> 00:16:59,080
Jimmy幾個月前搬出去了
Jimmy has not been around for months.

225
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:01,280
-為什麼 -Blake 你知道為什麼
- No, why? - Blake, you know why.

226
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:02,890
他超齡了
He aged out.

227
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:05,800
我們沒有資金去供給16歲以上的孩子
We don't have the resources to keep the boys on after 16.

228
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:08,100
Wayne基金不是一直資助嗎
I thought the Wayne Foundation gave money for them.

229
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,900
近幾年沒有了
Not for the past couple of years.

230
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,400
-他弟弟也在這兒吧 -Mark 我會告訴他的
- He has a brother here, doesn't he? - Mark. I'll tell him.

231
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:17,300
我來說吧 你不介意的話
I'd like to. If that's alright.

232
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,700
你知道他在下水道裡幹什麼嗎
You know what he was doing down there in the tunnels?

233
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:24,200
很多超齡的孩子都去下水道了
A lot of guys go in down in the tunnels when they aged out.

234
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:31,290
他們說可以住在裡面 還有工作
They said he lived down there. They says there's work down there.

235
00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:32,990
工作
Work?

236
00:17:33,090 --> 00:17:35,800
下水道裡能有什麼工作
What kind of work you can find in the sewers?

237
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:39,300
肯定比地上的好唄
More than you can find out here I guess.

238
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:42,280
- 你也知道蝙蝠俠 -當然了
- So you know about him. - Of course.

239
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:46,680
你覺得蝙蝠俠還會回來麼
Do you think he's coming back?

240
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:50,370
不知道
I don't know...

241
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:04,590
你還帶了個男的
You brought a date?

242
00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:08,290
我喜歡有人跟著 還能幫我開個門什麼的
I like someone around to open doors for me.

243
00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:12,200
右手 拿到了局部的指紋
Right hand, I got partials.

244
00:18:15,810 --> 00:18:18,400
很好
Very nice!

245
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:23,800
別急嘛 帥哥 我要的東西呢
Not so fast, handsome! You've got something for me?

246
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:26,200
哦 對了
Oh yes.

247
00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:38,310
我不知道你想拿Wayne先生的指紋幹嘛
I don't know what you're planning to do with Mr. Wayne's prints,

248
00:18:38,410 --> 00:18:42,210
但我猜 你很需要拇指吧
but I'm guessing, you need his thumb.

249
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:46,110
-不太會數數麼 -我會數數
- You don't count so good huh? - I count fine.

250
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:49,910
實際上 我現在就開始 數到10
In fact, I'm counting to 10 right now.

251
00:18:51,910 --> 00:18:53,910
好吧
Okay ...

252
00:18:56,970 --> 00:19:00,070
我朋友就在外面 按發送就好
My friend's outside, just...hit send.

253
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:13,410
-這地方真暗
- This place is a little dim.

254
00:19:13,410 --> 00:19:15,990
-等會兒就亮了 不騙你
- I'll light up in a minute. Trust me.

255
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:18,870
沒事吧
Is everything okay?

256
00:19:18,970 --> 00:19:21,270
沒事 等會兒見
Great. Catch you later.

257
00:19:27,670 --> 00:19:32,560
要是大家都按規矩辦事兒 不就簡單了麼
It would've been a lot easier to just give me what we agreed.

258
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:34,570
我們不能留活口
We can't have loose ends.

259
00:19:34,770 --> 00:19:39,270
不管你多漂亮 都沒用
and even in that dress, no one going to miss you.

260
00:19:39,370 --> 00:19:42,780
不 我那位朋友
No but my friend over there,

261
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:46,170
城裡的每個警察都在找他
Every cop in the city is missing him.

262
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,770
聰明 不過他們
That's cute! But they're

263
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:50,620
不會來這種地方找的
not going to be looking in a place like this.

264
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:55,160
這我就不敢肯定了 你剛才還用了他的電話呢
I don't know, you did use your cell phone.

265
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:23,630
警察 快趴下

- Careful, Miss. - He's bleeding! You gotta help him!

270
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:58,080
我找到議員了
I've got The Congressman.

271
00:21:26,890 --> 00:21:28,490
那邊
There!

272
00:21:32,390 --> 00:21:36,480
下水道 掀開 快派人下去
The manhole! Get this out. Get the GWPD down here!

273
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:38,940
你們三個 跟我下去
You three, down with me!

274
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:42,890
你們倆 你下去 堵住下個出口
You two, you go down, cover the next exit!

275
00:21:59,010 --> 00:22:01,180
什麼情況 他下去了?
What? He went down there?

276
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:34,810
- 我們要下去是吧 -那只是煤氣爆炸 孩子
- We're going down there, right? - That was a gas explosion, kid.

277
00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:36,320
什麼煤氣 這是下水道
What gas? It's a sewer.

278
00:22:36,430 --> 00:22:38,480
沒弄清楚下面有什麼之前 誰都不准下去
No one goes in there until we know what's down there.

279
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:40,420
我知道下面有什麼 長官 我們的警長
We know who's there sir, a police commissioner.

280
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:42,470
能有人把這個愣頭青拖走嗎
Someone get this hot head out of here.

281
00:22:42,590 --> 00:22:45,770
工程單位的人怎麼還沒來
and where's that GWP guy?

282
00:23:27,570 --> 00:23:30,010
你在這幹嘛
Why are you here?

283
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,360
回答他
Answer him!

284
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,850
我是問你
I was asking you.

285
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,640
這是本市警長
It's a Police Commissioner.

286
00:23:42,190 --> 00:23:46,670
-那你還帶他下來 -我們不知道該怎麼處理
- And you brought him down here? - We didn't know what to do.

287
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,450
-我們想 -你害怕了
- We just thought ... - You panicked.

288
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:51,440
你的軟弱導致了其他三個人的死亡
And your weakness cost the lives of three others.

289
00:23:51,570 --> 00:23:54,070
不 他只是有點
No. He's a little ...

290
00:23:56,730 --> 00:24:00,630
搜他身 搜完我再殺你
Search him. Then I'll kill you.

291
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:30,510
他死了
He's dead!

292
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:32,400
死要見屍
So show me his body!

293
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:34,690
這裡的水循環很複雜
The water runs to any one of the out flows.

294
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:36,780
我們不可能找到他的
We'll never find him.

295
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:45,220
-那就跟著他 -跟著他?
- Follow him. - Follow him?

296
00:24:59,870 --> 00:25:01,910
警長 警長 嘿
Detective! Detective! Hey!

297
00:25:02,090 --> 00:25:04,540
快醒醒
You awake?

298
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,600
我要見Bruce Wayne
I need to see Bruce Wayne.

299
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:14,300
不好意思 Wayne先生只接受預約來訪
I'm sorry, Mr. Wayne doesn't take unscheduled calls,

300
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,500
警察也不見
even from a police officer.

301
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:17,900
如果我去申請搜查令
If I go get a warrant for

302
00:25:17,910 --> 00:25:20,100
來調查Harvey Dent的謀殺案呢
the investigation of Harvey Dent's murder,

303
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:22,900
還不能算預約麼
it still counts as an unscheduled?

304
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:29,220
警官 我有什麼可以效勞的
How can I do for you officer?

305
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:32,080
Gordon警長中槍了
Commissioner Gordon been shot.

306
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,750
他追蹤一個槍手進了下水道
He chased a gun man down in the sewers.

307
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:39,200
我把他拉出來後 他一直說著什麼下水道裡的軍隊
When I pulled him out, he was babbling about an underground army,

308
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:41,960
有個戴面具的貝恩
a masked man called Bane.

309
00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:42,850
你不應該
Shouldn't you be telling

310
00:25:42,850 --> 00:25:44,270
跟你上級匯報這個麼
this to your superiors officers about this?

311
00:25:44,370 --> 00:25:47,910
上級問他看沒看見短嘴鱷
They asked if he saw any giant alligators.

312
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:50,700
他需要你
He needs you.

313
00:25:51,230 --> 00:25:53,790
他需要蝙蝠俠
He needs The Batman.

314
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:55,940
Gordon警長知道
Commissioner Gordon thinks ...

315
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:58,620
哦 他不知道 他才不管你是誰
Oh he doesn't know. He didn't care who you are.

316
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:01,950
但我們以前見過
But we met before.

317
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:06,690
很久很久以前我還是個孩子 在St. Swithin
There was a long ago, I was a kid at St. Swithin's ...

318
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:09,170
曾經被Wayne基金贊助的收容所
Used to funded by The Wayne Foundation.

319
00:26:09,170 --> 00:26:10,330
是個孤兒院
It's an orphanage.

320
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:13,920
我小時候媽媽車禍去世了
My mother died when I was small in a car accident.

321
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:15,620
但我不記得
But I don't remember it.

322
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:19,490
幾年後爸爸被槍殺
My dad got shot a couple of years later

323
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,620
以為一身賭債
for a gambling debt.

324
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:25,550
那個我倒是記得
Oh I remember that one just fine.

325
00:26:26,190 --> 00:26:29,180
並不是每個人都懂
Not a lot of people knows

326
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:34,560
那種深入骨髓的憤怒
what it feels like to be angry in your bones.

327
00:26:36,310 --> 00:26:40,540
他們總是理解 那些養父母
I mean they understand. The fosters parents.

328
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:42,940
他們都說理解
Everybody understands ...

329
00:26:43,070 --> 00:26:44,920
一段時間後
... For a while.

330
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:46,580
他們開始讓憤怒的孩子
Then they want the angry

331
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:49,520
做那些他們做不到的事
little kid to do something he knows he can't do

332
00:26:49,630 --> 00:26:51,400
放下
move on.

333
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:53,590
不久之後 他們就不再理解了
After a while they stop understanding.

334
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:55,480
他們把憤怒的孩子送到孤兒院
They send the angry little kid to a boy's school.

335
00:26:55,610 --> 00:26:57,310
我領悟的太晚了
I figured it out too late.

336
00:26:57,420 --> 00:27:00,550
你得學著掩蓋憤怒
You got to learn to hide the anger,

337
00:27:00,550 --> 00:27:03,310
對著鏡子 練習微笑
practice smiling in the mirror.

338
00:27:04,010 --> 00:27:06,780
就像戴著面具一樣
It's like putting on a mask.

339
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:10,710
有一天你出現了 開著香車
So you show up this one day, in a cool car,

340
00:27:10,710 --> 00:27:12,930
摟著美女
pretty girl in your arms.

341
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:18,870
我們都好激動 Bruce Wayne 那個億萬富翁孤兒
we were so excited! Bruce Wayne, billionaire orphan?

342
00:27:18,990 --> 00:27:22,500
我們經常編些關與你的故事 你的傳奇
We used to make up stories about you man, legends ...

343
00:27:22,610 --> 00:27:23,780
對於其他的小孩
and you know the other kids,

344
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:25,330
就只是故事而已
that's all it was, it's just stories.

345
00:27:28,170 --> 00:27:31,790
但當我見到你 我知道你是誰
But when I saw you, I knew who you really were.

346
00:27:32,010 --> 00:27:35,680
我見過你臉上的表情
I seen that look on your face before.

347
00:27:35,770 --> 00:27:38,920
就是我逼自己練習的那個
It's the same one that I taught myself.

348
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:43,010
我不懂你為什麼要給Dent背黑鍋
I don't why you take the fault of Dent's murder

349
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:46,410
但我依舊是蝙蝠俠的信徒
but I still a believer in The Batman.

350
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:49,690
就算你不是蝙蝠俠
Even if you're not...

351
00:27:50,810 --> 00:27:53,230
為什麼你說你們孤兒院
Why did you say that your boy's home

352
00:27:53,230 --> 00:27:56,050
曾經是Wayne基金贊助的
used to be funded by The Wayne Foundation?

353
00:27:56,110 --> 00:27:57,900
因為 資金停止了
Because the money stopped.

354
00:27:57,990 --> 00:27:59,950
你也該出去轉轉了
About time to get some fresh air

355
00:27:59,950 --> 00:28:02,650
好好瞭解下現在這個世界
and start paying attention to the details.

356
00:28:03,030 --> 00:28:06,460
有些人可能正需要你的幫助
Some of that details might need your help.

357
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:08,780
你查了那個人嗎 貝恩
Have you checked that name, Bane?

358
00:28:08,890 --> 00:28:11,180
他是僱傭兵 沒有名字
He's a mercenary. No names.

359
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:14,120
他和他的部下支持了西非的政變
He and he's man were behind a coup in West Africa.

360
00:28:14,210 --> 00:28:19,200
他們從我們的朋友John Daggett那兒 得到了採礦許可 
They've secured a mining operations for our friend, John Daggett.

361
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:22,170
-是Daggett帶他們來的 -看起來是的
- And Daggett brought them here. - So it seems.

362
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:26,830
-我會繼續查下去 -好的
- I'll keep digging. - Yeah.

363
00:28:27,430 --> 00:28:30,160
Alfred 為什麼Wayne基金
Alfred, why did The Wayne Foundation

364
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:33,550
停止向城裡的孤兒院捐款了
stopped funding the boy's home in the city?

365
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:39,140
基金是從Wayne公司的利潤裡提成的
The foundation is funded by the profits of Wayne Enterprises.

366
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:41,040
肯定是有的
There have to be some ...

367
00:28:41,090 --> 00:28:43,470
是時候跟Fox先生談談了
Time to talk to Mr. Fox I think.

368
00:28:43,470 --> 00:28:45,270
我去打給他
I'll get him on the phone.

369
00:28:45,270 --> 00:28:48,650
不用了 家裡還有車麼
No. Did we still have any car around the place?

370
00:28:48,670 --> 00:28:50,700
有的 一兩輛
Yes, one or two

371
00:28:50,790 --> 00:28:52,900
給我的腿預約個醫院
I need an appointment at a hospital for my leg.

372
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:56,480
-哪家醫院 -Jim Gordon住的那家
- Which hospital? - Which ever one Jim Gordon's in.

373
00:29:00,130 --> 00:29:02,350
我看過更糟糕的軟骨
I've seen worst cartilage in knees.

374
00:29:02,430 --> 00:29:03,550
-還不錯 -不
- It's a good? - No.

375
00:29:03,650 --> 00:29:05,710
你膝蓋裡根本就沒有軟骨
That's because there's no cartilage in your knees

376
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:09,270
肘部和肩部的軟組織也有部分缺失
and not much of any use in your elbows or your shoulders.

377
00:29:09,370 --> 00:29:11,760
除此之外 腎臟的舊傷 
Between that and scar tissue on your kidney,

378
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:14,250
大腦也有震盪後的殘留損傷
residual concussive damage to your brain tissue

379
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:16,980
以及你渾身上下的大小傷
and the general scar over quality of your body,

380
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:19,420
我不建議你玩直升機滑雪哦 Wayne先生
I cannot recommend you to go heli-skiing, Mr. Wayne.

381
00:29:19,530 --> 00:29:21,900
好的
Right.

382
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:42,080
我們是一起的 我以為你離開了
We're in this together. I thought you were gone.

383
00:29:42,170 --> 00:29:45,480
人們不再需要蝙蝠了 我們贏了
The Batman wasn't needed anymore. We won...

384
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:48,800
我們撒了無數的謊
We strung a lie.

385
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:55,000
而現在罪惡又在我們試圖毀滅它的地方重新燃起
Now there's evil rises again where we try to bury him.

386
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:59,300
蝙蝠俠必須歸來
The Batman has to come back.

387
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:02,400
如果他已不復存在了呢
And if he doesn't exist anymore?

388
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:05,760
他必須回來
He must. You ...

389
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:21,680
錢包是你拿的 是吧
You got them wallet, do you?

390
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:24,590
-你偷了我的錢包 -不 我沒有
- You took my wallet! - No I didn't!

391
00:30:24,890 --> 00:30:27,490
-滾開 -她偷我錢包
- Get out! - She took my wallet...

392
00:30:27,730 --> 00:30:29,010
滾

00:30:29,730 --> 00:30:30,910

都不知道那麼緊張幹嘛 就60塊而已
I don't know why he's so upset about. It's only 60 bucks in here.

395
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:36,000
可能是擔心手錶吧
probably the watch.

396
00:30:50,230 --> 00:30:51,000
那是誰
Who's that?

397
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,030
另一個爬不出跑車的老爺爺
Another stiff convety climb out of his sport car.

398
00:30:54,110 --> 00:30:55,140
是Bruce Wayne
Well that's Bruce Wayne!

399
00:30:55,250 --> 00:30:58,530
Bruce Wayne 看這裡
Bruce Wayne, over here!

400
00:31:01,510 --> 00:31:02,500
-我不確定我的助理
- I'm not sure if my assistant ...

401
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:03,430
-這邊請 Wayne先生
- Right through here, Mr. Wayne.

402
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:05,550
多謝了
Thank you so much.

403
00:31:10,390 --> 00:31:14,720
Bruce Wayne驚現慈善舞會
Bruce Wayne at a charity ball?

404
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:17,790
Tate小姐 是吧
Ms. Tate, is it not?

405
00:31:17,910 --> 00:31:21,530
就算在你閉關以前 你也很少參加這種活動
Even before you became a recluse, you never came to these events.

406
00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:23,790
油水都流回富人身上了
Proceeds goes to big fat spread.

407
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:24,860
這才不是慈善舞會
This is not about charity.

408
00:31:25,060 --> 00:31:29,730
這只不過是哪個社交魔女依賴的野心食量而已
It's about feeding the ego which ever society hag laid this on.

409
00:31:29,850 --> 00:31:32,610
實際上 這是我的舞會 Wayne先生
Actually this is my party, Mr. Wayne.

410
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:36,510
所得善款會得其所用
And the proceeds will go where they should,

411
00:31:36,590 --> 00:31:40,040
因為油水都是我自掏腰包的
because I paid for the big fat spread myself.

412
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:41,710
那你油水流的很慷慨嘛
You spread generously?

413
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:45,140
這世界上 想要有所收穫就要有所投資嘛
You have to invest if you want to restore balance to the world.

414
00:31:45,790 --> 00:31:48,020
接受我們的清潔能源企劃
Take our clean energy project.

415
00:31:48,130 --> 00:31:50,780
有時 付出並不一定有回報
Sometimes, the investments just doesn't pay off.

416
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:52,400
抱歉
I'm sorry.

417
00:31:52,490 --> 00:31:55,100
Wayne 你的冷漠只是一張面具
You have a practiced absent, Mr. Wayne.

418
00:31:55,270 --> 00:31:56,440
要是一個人根本不關心
But a man who does not care

419
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:58,440
這個世界的話 是不會花掉一半身家
about the world doesn't spend half his fortune

420
00:31:58,530 --> 00:32:00,690
去拯救它的
on a plan to save it.

421
00:32:01,150 --> 00:32:06,390
而且也不會在失敗後那麼消沉從此隱退
And isn't so wounded when it's fail but he goes into hiding

422
00:32:07,710 --> 00:32:10,590
玩的愉快 Wayne先生
Have a good evening, Mr. Wayne!

423
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:15,900
介意我接手麼
Mind if I cut in?

424
00:32:16,730 --> 00:32:18,420
多謝
Thank you.

425
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:22,940
見到我好像沒有很開心哦
You're don't seem happy to see me.

426
00:32:23,010 --> 00:32:26,480
-你應該在閉關才對 -突然想呼吸新鮮空氣了呢
- You're suppose to be a shut-in. - I felt like some fresh air.

427
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:29,280
為什麼不叫警察
Why didn't you called the police?

428
00:32:29,390 --> 00:32:32,650
我有一個神奇的朋友專門處理這種問題
I have a powerful friend who deals with things like these.

429
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:37,520
一個穿著釬焊服裝的飛賊
It's a brazing costume for a cat burglar.

430
00:32:37,610 --> 00:32:40,270
-是麼 那你又是誰啊
- Yeah? Who are you pretending to be?

431
00:32:40,270 --> 00:32:42,930
-Bruce Wayne 古怪的大富翁啊
- Bruce Wayne, eccentric billionaire.

432
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:45,960
-你舞伴是誰 -他老婆在Ibiza
- Who's your date? - His wife is in Ibiza.

433
00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:49,860
她把鑽石都留在家裡了 怕被偷走呢
She left her diamonds behind though, worried it might get stolen.

434
00:32:50,150 --> 00:32:52,210
是Ibitha
It pronounced 'Ibitha'.

435
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:53,590
你不會希望他們中有人
You wouldn't want any of

436
00:32:53,590 --> 00:32:55,640
發現你是個賊吧
these folks realizing you're a crook

437
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:56,470
而不是什麼社交名媛
not a Social planner.

438
00:32:56,550 --> 00:33:00,280
你以為我在乎別人怎麼看我嗎
You think I care what everyone in this rooms thinks of me?

439
00:33:01,070 --> 00:33:03,880
我打賭你在乎每個人對你的每一種看法
I doubt you care anyone in any room who thinks of you.

440
00:33:03,970 --> 00:33:07,860
別自以為是了 Wayne先生 你根本就不瞭解我
Don't candescent, Mr. Wayne. You don't know me a thing about me.

441
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:10,300
是麼 Selina Kyle
Well Selina Kyle.

442
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:12,500
我知道你住在舊城區
I know you came here from your walk-out Old Town,

443
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:14,430
對珠寶賊來說也太節儉了
a modest place for a master jewel thief.

444
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:16,700
也就是說 你要麼是在為退休攢錢
Which means that either you're saving for retirement

445
00:33:16,790 --> 00:33:21,230
要麼就是你了大麻煩
or you in deep with the wrong people.

446
00:33:22,010 --> 00:33:24,070
別以為你生在Wayne家老宅的主臥 
You don't get to judge me just because you

447
00:33:24,070 --> 00:33:26,280
就有資格對我指指點點
were born the master bedroom of Wayne....

448
00:33:26,390 --> 00:33:27,750
實際上 我生在酒店的套房裡
Actually, I was born in the Regency room.

449
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:30,410
我別無選擇
I started out doing what I had to.

450
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:33,260
一旦你開始做必須要做的事
Once you're done what you had to,

451
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:35,130
人們就不允許你再做你想做的事
They never let you do what you wanted to.

452
00:33:35,250 --> 00:33:36,940
重新開始
Start fresh.

453
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:39,970
現在這個世界哪還有重新開始
There's no fresh start in today's world.

454
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:42,980
隨便一個12歲小朋友用手機都能查到你的平生
Any 12 years old with a cell phone would find out what you did.

455
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:47,200
我們做的任何事都留在檔案裡 無法擺脫
Everything we do is collated and quantified everything sticks.

456
00:33:47,290 --> 00:33:49,850
你就是這麼為自己的偷竊辯解的?
Is that how you justify stealing?

457
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:52,550
我從富人身上拿走我需要的
I take what I need from those who have more than enough.

458
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,790
絕對不會拿窮人的東西
I don't stand on the shoulders of the people with less.

459
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:55,960
俠盜羅賓漢喲?
Robin Hood?

460
00:33:56,150 --> 00:33:57,190
我覺得我幫助的人
I think I do more to help

461
00:33:57,190 --> 00:33:59,040
比這房裡的大多數人都多
someone than most of the people in this room.

462
00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:00,710
比你多
Than you.

463
00:34:01,530 --> 00:34:03,400
我覺得 可能是你想太多了
I think maybe you're assuming a little too much.

464
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:05,900
我覺得 可能是你對你褲襠裡除了錢以外的
Maybe you're being unrealistic about what's

465
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:07,780
其它某些東西太過自信了
really in your pants other than wallets.

466
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:08,700
哎喲
Ouch.

467
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:11,280
你以為會一直這樣歌舞昇平嗎
You think all this can last?

468
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:14,280
暴風雨就要來了 Wayne先生
There's a storm coming, Mr. Wayne.

469
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:17,680
你和你朋友最好準備準備
You and your friends better battered down the hatches.

470
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:20,090
因為風暴一來 你們就會意識到
Because when it hits, you're all going to wonder

471
00:34:20,290 --> 00:34:23,750
你們曾以為自己能窮奢極欲 
you could ever thought you could live so large

472
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:26,780
不管他人的死活是有多天真
and leave so little for the rest of us.

473
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:33,080
聽起來你似乎很期待暴風雨的來臨
You sound like you're looking forward to it.

474
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:35,380
我適應力很強的
I'm adaptable.

475
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:38,180
這條項鏈戴在你身上確實很好看 
Those pearls do look better on you than it did in my safe,

476
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:42,160
但我還是需要拿回去
but I still can't let you keep them.

477
00:34:48,870 --> 00:34:52,010
你嚇跑她了
You scared her off!

478
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:56,500
才怪
Not likely ...

479
00:34:58,080 --> 00:34:59,510
我把停車票丟了
I still lost my ticket.

480
00:34:59,620 --> 00:35:01,720
你太太說你會打車回家的
Your wife said you're taking the cab home.

481
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:02,240
我太太
My wife?

482
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:12,500
就你一個 少爺
Just you, sir?

483
00:35:14,850 --> 00:35:17,500
別擔心 Wayne少爺
Don't worry, Master Wayne.

484
00:35:17,590 --> 00:35:20,740
情場鬼見愁 也要花點時間重新適應的
Takes a little time to get back in the swing of things.

485
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:26,670
Bruce Wayne 見到你真是讓人吃驚
Bruce Wayne! Design, live and breathe

486
00:35:27,870 --> 00:35:30,590
是什麼把你從冬眠中喚醒的 Wayne先生
What brings you out of prior sleep, Mr. Wayne?

487
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:32,220
看來你還沒丟掉你的幽默感
I see you haven't lost your sense of humor,

488
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:34,800
即使你丟掉了我不少錢
even if you have lost most of my money.

489
00:35:34,830 --> 00:35:36,520
事實上 是你自己弄丟的
Actually you did that.

490
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:39,440
如果你將整個研發部門的經費
If you follow all your entire RND budget

491
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:42,420
投入到能源計劃裡 又閒置它
to a fusion project that you get mock more.

492
00:35:42,510 --> 00:35:44,570
你的公司是不可能掙錢的
Your company is unlikely to thrive.

493
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:46,300
我有什麼選擇
What are the options?

494
00:35:46,390 --> 00:35:48,620
你依然堅持不啟動那台機器嗎
Well if you're not unwilling to turn on the machine,

495
00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:51,270
不能 不能啟動 Lucius.
I can't. I can't, Lucius.

496
00:35:51,390 --> 00:35:53,400
那麼 還是先坐好吧
Well then sit tight.

497
00:35:53,490 --> 00:35:55,330
你陷入了困境
Your majority keep dagger at bay

498
00:35:55,430 --> 00:35:56,810
當我們和Miranda Tate
while we figured out a

499
00:35:56,810 --> 00:35:59,800
為能源項目構想未來的時候
future for the energy program with Miranda Tate.

500
00:35:59,890 --> 00:36:02,740
她一直很支持這個項目
She has supported the project all the way.

501
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:06,290
她既聰明又可愛
She's smart and quite lovely.

502
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:10,530
我們都是為了你好 Bruce
We all just want what's best for you, Bruce.

503
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:14,910
- 給她看看那機器 - 我考慮一下
- Show her the machine. - I think it over.

504
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:18,800
- 還有其他事嗎 - 沒了 怎麼
- Anything else? - Nope. Why?

505
00:36:18,890 --> 00:36:23,290
我們的談話一向已非尋常的要求告終
Well these conversation used to end with an unusual request.

506
00:36:23,670 --> 00:36:25,630
我退隱了
I retired.

507
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:29,600
不管怎樣 我給你看些東西
Let me show you some stuff, anyway.

508
00:36:33,470 --> 00:36:35,550
就當憶想當年吧
Just for old times' sake.

509
00:36:39,170 --> 00:36:41,550
我以為你不得不關閉這裡
I figured you had to shut this place down.

510
00:36:41,610 --> 00:36:44,240
官方記錄上 它一直是關閉著的
Oh, it was always shut down. Officially.

511
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:45,760
什麼新玩意兒
What's the new stuff ...

512
00:36:45,850 --> 00:36:48,070
你父親去世後
After your father died, Wayne Enterprises

513
00:36:48,070 --> 00:36:50,540
韋恩集團成立了14個不同的國防裝備子公司
has set up 14 different defense subsidiaries.

514
00:36:50,630 --> 00:36:53,100
多年來我嘗試著把所有的原型機
For years, I've been shuttering and consolidating

515
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:55,320
集中到一個屋簷下
all the different prototypes under one roof.

516
00:36:55,430 --> 00:36:57,390
- 我的屋簷 - 為什麼
- My roof. - Why?

517
00:36:57,530 --> 00:37:00,330
為了不讓它們落入惡人手中
Keep them from falling into the wrong hands.

518
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:06,090
現在你簡直是在炫耀了
Now you just showing off.

519
00:37:06,930 --> 00:37:08,600
這是個國防項目
It's a defense department project.

520
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:12,110
用於精確的區域鎮壓
Tight Geometer Urban Pacification.

521
00:37:12,190 --> 00:37:14,590
旋翼的設計讓其能
Rotors are configured to maneuver between buildings

522
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:17,050
在建築中自由穿行
without recirculation.

523
00:37:17,210 --> 00:37:19,190
它叫什麼
What it's call?

524
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:23,700
有一個又長又無聊的韋恩集團命名
It has a long uninteresting Wayne Enterprise』s designation.

525
00:37:23,790 --> 00:37:27,230
我只想稱它為蝙蝠
I just the took of calling it The Bat.

526
00:37:27,930 --> 00:37:31,110
是的 Wayne先生 有一款黑色的
And yes Mr. Wayne, it does come in black.

527
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:35,750
運行穩定 只是沒有自動駕駛系統
Works fine, except for the autopilot.

528
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:37,940
只有等比我智商更高的人添上去了
Takes a better mind than mine to fix it.

529
00:37:38,030 --> 00:37:39,580
比你智商還高的人
A better mind?

530
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:42,910
我只是謙虛一下
Well I was trying to be modest.

531
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:47,010
至少不那麼忙的人 比如說你
A less busy mind, yours.

532
00:37:54,330 --> 00:37:55,930
看起來會有點痛
It should be a bit painful.

533
00:37:56,030 --> 00:37:57,730
你可以試試 Alfred
You'll be very welcome to try, Alfred.

534
00:37:57,830 --> 00:38:00,830
我看著就好了 謝謝你 先生
Happy watching. Thank you, sir.

535
00:38:03,150 --> 00:38:04,850
不錯
Not bad ...

536
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:11,430
是相當不錯
Not bad at all!

537
00:38:14,130 --> 00:38:17,530
如果你真想重出江湖
If you're seriously considering going back out there,

538
00:38:17,630 --> 00:38:20,040
你應該聽聽一些關於Bane的傳言
you should hear the rumors surrounding Bane.

539
00:38:20,140 --> 00:38:21,840
洗耳恭聽
I'm all ears.

540
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:25,240
在一處古老的地方 有這麼個監獄
There is a prison in a more ancient part of the world.

541
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:31,330
人們被扔進這個地獄遭受苦難 等待死亡
A pit where men are thrown to suffer and die.

542
00:38:31,430 --> 00:38:35,230
但是有一天 一個人從這片黑暗中一躍而出
But sometimes a man rises from the darkness.

543
00:38:35,330 --> 00:38:39,430
有一天 那地獄送了一些東西回人間
Sometimes, the pit sends something back.

544
00:38:39,530 --> 00:38:41,930
- Bane - 沒錯
- Bane! - Right.

545
00:38:42,030 --> 00:38:44,940
在人間煉獄中 他出生長大
Born and raised in hell on earth.

546
00:38:45,140 --> 00:38:46,140
生於監獄
Born in a prison?

547
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:48,940
沒人知道他是怎麼逃出來的
No one knows why or how he escaped.

548
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:51,810
但他們知道他逃出來後
But they do know once he did,

549
00:38:51,810 --> 00:38:56,010
他在忍者大師門下磨煉 你的師傅
he was trained by Ra's Al Ghul, your mentor.

550
00:38:56,140 --> 00:38:58,600
Bane是 影武者聯盟 中的一員
Bane was a member of The League of Shadows.

551
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:00,960
後來他被逐出了聯盟
And then he was excommunicated.

552
00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:04,880
如果有人讓忍者大師都覺得太過極端
And any man who is too extreme for Ra's Al Ghul,

553
00:39:04,890 --> 00:39:07,070
絕不容輕視
is not to be trifled with.

554
00:39:07,180 --> 00:39:10,880
我可不是以輕視罪犯的聞名的
I didn't realized I was known for trifling with criminals.

555
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:12,510
此一時彼一時
That was then.

556
00:39:12,620 --> 00:39:15,880
現在你可以綁好你的腿 重新戴上面具
Then you can just strap up your leg and put your mask back on,

557
00:39:15,990 --> 00:39:18,060
但這不代表你回到了當年的狀態
but that doesn't make you what you were.

558
00:39:18,170 --> 00:39:21,450
如果這個人有你說的一半厲害
If this man is everything what you say he is,

559
00:39:21,450 --> 00:39:23,200
那麼這個城市需要我
then the city needs me.

560
00:39:23,310 --> 00:39:28,520
這城市需要Bruce Wayne 你的資源 你的學識
The city needs Bruce Wayne, your resources, your knowledge.

561
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:31,670
而不是你的身體和生命
It doesn't need your body or your life.

562
00:39:32,260 --> 00:39:33,760
那個時代已經過去
That times has past.

563
00:39:33,850 --> 00:39:37,040
你是怕我出去後 會失敗嗎
You're afraid if I go back out there, I'll fail.

564
00:39:37,130 --> 00:39:38,890
不是
No.

565
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:44,320
我是怕你想那樣
I'm afraid that you want to.

566
00:39:57,390 --> 00:40:00,810
如果Bruce Wayne參加宴會 股票就會下跌
You can't short the stock if Bruce Wayne goes to a party.

567
00:40:00,910 --> 00:40:02,290
Wayne的回歸使股市震盪
Wayne's coming back has change.

568
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,990
這是好事還是壞事 - 我想是壞的
- Changes, is it good or bad? - I vote bad.

569
00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:08,020
- 憑什麼 - 拋硬幣
- On what basis? - I flip the coin.

570
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:16,300
我說了不要全麥麵包
I said no rye man.

571
00:40:18,970 --> 00:40:22,490
小伙子 請卸下頭盔 我們這需人臉監控
Rookie! Loose the helmet! We need faces for camera.

572
00:40:27,490 --> 00:40:29,690
來吧 我們去掠奪
Come on let's go scalping.

573
00:41:31,060 --> 00:41:33,940
這是股票交易中心 沒有錢給你搶
This is a stock exchange. There's no money you can steal.

574
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:37,640
真的嗎 那你們這幫人在這幹嘛
Really? Then why are you people here?

575
00:42:01,770 --> 00:42:03,570
你必須要進去
You got to get in there!

576
00:42:03,670 --> 00:42:06,680
- 有人被劫持了嘛 - 不是 這是個搶劫案
- It's a hostage situation. - No! This is a robbery!

577
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:08,990
他們直接進入了在線交易平台
They have direct access to the online trading desk.

578
00:42:09,090 --> 00:42:11,490
我不會為了你們的錢而讓我的人冒險
I'm not risking my men for your money.

579
00:42:14,890 --> 00:42:17,290
先生 你要離開這裡 我們在辦案
Sir, you going to ask you to move. We have a situation here.

580
00:42:17,390 --> 00:42:19,490
不是我們的錢 是每個人的
It's not our money, it's everybody's.

581
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:21,750
真的嗎 我的錢都在床墊裡
Really? Mine is in my mattress.

582
00:42:21,870 --> 00:42:23,160
如果不把這些人拿下
If don't put these guys down,

583
00:42:23,260 --> 00:42:26,600
那麼在你床墊裡的錢 就會變得分文不值
that something in your mattress maybe be worth a whole hell of a lot less.

584
00:42:26,690 --> 00:42:29,020
切斷光纖電纜 毀了那個基站
Cut the fiber cable and take out that cell tower.

585
00:42:29,110 --> 00:42:31,220
- 謝謝你 - 那會拖住他們
- Thank you. - That will slow them down.

586
00:42:37,550 --> 00:42:38,990
他們切斷了光纖
They cut the Fiber.

587
00:42:40,270 --> 00:42:43,430
- 基站還在工作 - 現在而已
- The cell's working. - For now.

588
00:42:48,670 --> 00:42:49,670
把這些障礙都立起來
Get all this barriers up.

589
00:42:49,770 --> 00:42:50,530
全給我立起來
I want all of them up.

590
00:42:50,540 --> 00:42:52,170
這幾條街上不許任何人進出
No one gets in or out of any of these streets.

591
00:42:52,220 --> 00:42:55,560
- 我能轉移到哪去 - 退一下
- Where am I suppose to move it? - Back it up.

592
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:02,140
呆在車裡別出來 好嗎
Just stay in your vehicle, okay?

593
00:43:08,750 --> 00:43:12,010
程序還需要多少時間
How much longer does the program needs?

594
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:14,800
8分鐘
Eight minutes.

595
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:17,090
我們該撤了
Time to go move out.

596
00:43:17,130 --> 00:43:18,640
每個人都站起來
Everybody up!

597
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:24,220
你們兩個 走
You two, move!

598
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:28,450
謝謝

604
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:05,660
快 快

嘿 放我走
Hey, let me go!

606

607
00:44:23,170 --> 00:44:26,220
- 射輪胎 - 不能射
- Shoot the tires! - There's no shot.

608
00:44:27,530 --> 00:44:30,710
往後退 往後退 他們有人質

我什麼都看不見
I can't pick up anything!

614
00:44:53,020 --> 00:44:54,040
那他媽的誰啊
Who the hell was that?

615
00:44:54,170 --> 00:44:57,450
孩子 今晚有好戲看了

625
00:45:46,510 --> 00:45:48,210
我要做Jim Gordon沒有做到的事
I'm going to do what Jim Gordon never could.

626
00:45:48,310 --> 00:45:51,100
- 什麼事 - 我要抓住蝙蝠俠
- What's that? - I'm going to take down The Batman.

627
00:45:52,490 --> 00:45:54,480
4個嫌疑犯正劫持著
..The 4 suspect are carrying two hostages

628
00:45:54,570 --> 00:45:56,670
在哥譚股票交易中心綁架的兩名人質

633
00:46:07,450 --> 00:46:09,600
好吧 這多難說
Well what do you know..

634
00:46:14,050 --> 00:46:17,220
老大 那些劫匪怎麼辦

求求你 放我走吧 求求你了

一輛摩托車已經停下了

沒有人質了 我們還追捕嗎

638

別追了 在這兒等蝙蝠俠

639
00:46:43,510 --> 00:46:45,380
- 劫犯要逃走了 - 你想抓哪一個
- He's getting away. - Who do you want to catch huh?

640
00:46:45,460 --> 00:46:48,400
幾個搶劫犯還是殺了Harvey Dent的那個狗娘養的傢伙
Some robber or the son-of-a-bitch who killed Harvey Dent?

641
00:46:57,330 --> 00:47:00,510
8年了 他非要選今晚出現
Eight years and he has to pick tonight.

642
00:47:00,510 --> 00:47:03,050
他把警察從Bane身上引開了

他跑了
We lost him.

646
00:48:34,570 --> 00:48:36,420
你們是怎麼讓他跑了的
How could you lose him?

647
00:48:36,550 --> 00:48:37,920
他火力充足
He's got a lot of firepower.

648
00:48:38,060 --> 00:48:40,220
那又怎麼樣 你們不充足嗎
And what? You don't?

649
00:48:44,270 --> 00:48:46,170
他折回市區了
He heads back downtown.

650
00:48:46,230 --> 00:48:48,160
他跟他的穿著一樣傻
and he's as dumb as he dresses.

651
00:48:48,270 --> 00:48:50,240
包圍上 夥計們
Close it up, gentlemen!

652
00:49:22,690 --> 00:49:25,390
他簡直是落籠的老鼠 夥計們
Like a rat in a trap, gentlemen!

653
00:49:30,350 --> 00:49:33,810
這好像不是老鼠吧 老大
It might've the wrong animal there, sir!

654
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:46,200
你確定是他嗎
You're sure it was him?

655
00:49:52,590 --> 00:49:56,140
Bane說蝙蝠俠介入了 但任務仍圓滿完成
Bane says that Batman interfered, but the task was accomplished.

656
00:49:56,260 --> 00:49:57,920
那他們逮捕的人呢
What about the men they've arrested?

657
00:49:58,050 --> 00:50:02,730
我引用他的原話 他們死也不會開口的
He said and I quote: ' They would die before talking. '

658
00:50:03,490 --> 00:50:06,230
他在哪找的這些人
Where does he finds these guys?

659
00:50:07,330 --> 00:50:09,360
開香檳
Open the champagne!

660
00:50:11,190 --> 00:50:13,590
我們能叫幾個妞來嗎
And can we get some girls in here?

661
00:50:13,590 --> 00:50:15,660
你確定你消受得了
Be careful what you wish for!

662
00:50:26,090 --> 00:50:29,010
- 貓吃了你的舌頭嗎 - 你這蠢女人
- Cat got your tongue? - You dumb bitch!

663
00:50:29,120 --> 00:50:31,240
從沒人罵過我蠢
Nobody ever accuse of being dumb.

664
00:50:31,350 --> 00:50:34,880
今晚來這兒 你的確是個蠢貨
You're dumb, for coming here tonight.

665
00:50:35,300 --> 00:50:38,560
我要拿回你欠我的
I want what you owe me.

666
00:50:39,180 --> 00:50:43,300
- 你不會得到的 - 裝備不錯
- One doesn't get ... - Nice outfit!

667
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:45,410
穿著高跟鞋走路不會不方便嗎
Aren't those heels make it tough to walk?

668
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:49,290
我不知道 你說呢
I don't know, do you think?

669
00:50:50,360 --> 00:50:51,970
- 它在哪裡 - 什麼在哪裡
- So where is it? - Where's what?

670
00:50:52,080 --> 00:50:54,450
「清洗程序」
The program ' The Clean Slate '.

671
00:50:54,580 --> 00:50:58,000
為有犯罪記錄的超級大盜設計的終極程序
The Ultimate Tool for a master thief with a record.

672
00:50:58,630 --> 00:51:00,160
不許動
Hold it right there!

673
00:51:13,670 --> 00:51:17,080
- 在哪裡 - 「清洗程序」嗎
- Where is it?! - ' The Clean Slate? '

674
00:51:17,170 --> 00:51:19,130
當你輸入一個人的名字 出生日期
When you type in someone's name, date of birth

675
00:51:19,170 --> 00:51:23,630
幾分鐘後所有相關數據都消失了
and a few minutes they're gone, every database on earth.

676
00:51:23,780 --> 00:51:26,300
聽起來美好得不真實
Sounds a little too good to be true?

677
00:51:26,390 --> 00:51:30,260
你在說謊 RIKEN數據已做到試運行階段了
You're lying! RIKEN DATA took it to the prototype stage.

678
00:51:30,390 --> 00:51:32,460
所以我買他們
That's why I bought them.

679
00:51:32,630 --> 00:51:37,720
但是他們什麼都沒有 不過是個傳說
But they had nothing. It was a gang-land myth.

680
00:51:48,610 --> 00:51:50,330
往後退
Stay back!

681
00:51:53,110 --> 00:51:55,070
我不是在虛張聲勢
I'm not bluffing!

682
00:51:55,690 --> 00:51:59,310
他們知道 它們只是不在乎
They know! They just don't care.

683
00:52:16,010 --> 00:52:18,600
- 你耍我吧 - 不用槍 不殺人
- You got to be kidding me. - No guns, no killing.

684
00:52:18,700 --> 00:52:20,240
那有什麼樂趣
Where the fun in that?

685
00:52:38,940 --> 00:52:41,360
我媽媽提醒過我不要隨便上陌生人的車
My mother warned about getting into cars with strange men.

686
00:52:41,450 --> 00:52:43,560
這不是車
This isn't a car.

687
00:53:31,010 --> 00:53:31,860
回見
See you around!

688
00:53:32,540 --> 00:53:34,020
不用謝
You're welcome!

689
00:53:34,110 --> 00:53:37,120
- 我能控制局勢 - 他們不是街頭暴徒
- I had it under control. - Those weren't street thugs.

690
00:53:37,270 --> 00:53:40,780
他們是訓練有素的殺手 我救了你的命
They were trained killers. I saved your life.

691
00:53:40,930 --> 00:53:43,690
作為回報 我想知道
In return, I need to know

692
00:53:43,690 --> 00:53:45,570
你為什麼要偷Bruce Wayne的指紋
what you did with Bruce Wayne's fingerprints.

693
00:53:45,660 --> 00:53:49,080
Wayne說他有個厲害的朋友 看來不是撒謊
Wayne wasn't kidding about a powerful friend.

694
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:52,200
我把他指紋賣給了Daggett
I sold his prints to Daggett.

695
00:53:52,390 --> 00:53:56,060
為了些一些子虛烏有的目的
Something that doesn't even exist.

696
00:53:56,130 --> 00:53:58,800
我以為你不會這麼容易上當
I doubt that will get the better of you.

697
00:53:58,800 --> 00:53:59,970
當一個女孩走途無路時
Hey when a girl's desperate...

698
00:53:59,980 --> 00:54:01,550
他用指紋做什麼
What's he going to do with them?

699
00:54:01,650 --> 00:54:03,530
我不知道 但是Daggett
I don't know but Dagget seem pretty

700
00:54:03,530 --> 00:54:05,880
似乎對股票市場發生的混亂很感興趣
interested in that mess at the stock market.

701
00:54:11,450 --> 00:54:13,440
Kyle小姐
Miss Kyle ...

702
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:18,410
原來這就是被甩的感覺
So that's what that feels like...

703
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:39,300
我在新聞報道中看見你了
I seen you in the television coverage,

704
00:54:39,300 --> 00:54:41,980
你已嘗到了重回街頭的感覺了吧
you've got your taste for wanting destruction back.

705
00:54:42,080 --> 00:54:43,780
這兒有三張磁盤
There are 3 disks.

706
00:54:44,190 --> 00:54:46,700
不該讓警方調查嗎
Aren't the police suppose to be investigating them?

707
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:48,600
他們沒有工具能分析它
They don't have the tools to analyze it.

708
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:50,300
你捐給他們就好了
They would if you gave it to them.

709
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:53,000
一人的工具會成為另一人的武器
One man's tool is another man weapon.

710
00:54:53,100 --> 00:54:53,970
在你看來也許是
In your mind perhaps,

711
00:54:53,970 --> 00:54:56,300
但不能被變成武器的東西本就沒多少
but there aren't many things can't turn into a weapons.

712
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:59,090
Alfred 夠了 警方沒能追住他們
Alfred, enough! The police weren't getting it done

713
00:54:59,090 --> 00:55:00,390
也許他們會呢
Perhaps they might have.

714
00:55:00,390 --> 00:55:02,760
如果你沒有做餘興表演的話
If you hadn't made the side show of yourself.

715
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:04,020
我才沒有
You I didn't had it in me.

716
00:55:04,020 --> 00:55:06,650
你有 你要在警察面前表現自己 
No! You got to glow at the police force, a married chased

717
00:55:06,650 --> 00:55:09,340
還迷戀於Fox那來的一些花俏新玩具
with a lot of fancy new toys from Fox's.

718
00:55:09,340 --> 00:55:11,440
當你哪天遇到他又怎麼辦
What about when you come up against him?

719
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:12,120
那時候
What then?

720
00:55:12,120 --> 00:55:13,520
更努力地戰鬥 我一直都這樣
I'll fight harder. I always have.

721
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:16,990
看看 他的速度 他的兇猛 他的技巧
Take a look, his speed, his ferocity, his training.

722
00:55:17,090 --> 00:55:20,180
我看見了信念的力量
I see the power of believe.

723
00:55:20,180 --> 00:55:23,490
我看見了影武者聯盟的影子
I see The League of Shadows insurgent.

724
00:55:23,490 --> 00:55:26,490
- 你說他被逐出聯盟了 - 被忍者大師
- You said he was excommunicated. - By Ra's Al Ghul.

725
00:55:26,590 --> 00:55:28,790
現在誰在領導他們
Who leads them now?

726
00:55:28,890 --> 00:55:31,930
忍者大師是影武者聯盟的首領 我打敗了他
Ra's Al Ghul was The League of Shadows and I beat him.

727
00:55:31,930 --> 00:55:34,880
Bane只是個僱傭兵 我們要找出他的真實目的
Bane is just a mercenary, we need to find out what he's up to.

728
00:55:35,450 --> 00:55:38,760
類似某種交易 編碼的
Trade of some kind. Coded.

729
00:55:38,850 --> 00:55:41,780
Selina Kyle竊取了我的指紋
And my fingerprints courtesy of Selina Kyle.

730
00:55:41,870 --> 00:55:42,880
把這給Fox
Give this to Fox.

731
00:55:42,990 --> 00:55:44,360
他能破解密碼
He can crack the code

732
00:55:44,360 --> 00:55:47,420
告訴我們他們在進行什麼交易
and tell us what trades they were executing.

733
00:55:51,140 --> 00:55:54,750
我會把這交給Fox先生但是不會再有下次了
I'll give this to Mr. Fox but no more.

734
00:55:56,370 --> 00:56:00,170
我看著你出生 服侍你長大 但我不想埋葬你
I sewed you up, I set your bums but I wont bury you.

735
00:56:00,270 --> 00:56:04,220
Wayne家族成員的死我已經看得夠多了
I buried enough members in The Wayne family.

736
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:05,880
你要離我而去嗎
You're leaving me?

737
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:09,440
你固執的覺得自己只有一個未來
You see only one end to your journey.

738
00:56:09,870 --> 00:56:14,420
為了讓你醒悟 我必須離開
Leaving is all I have to make you understand.

739
00:56:14,650 --> 00:56:18,870
你再也不是蝙蝠俠了 你要尋找另一種生活方式
You're not Batman anymore. You have to find another way.

740
00:56:18,870 --> 00:56:19,950
你曾經說過
You used to talked about

741
00:56:19,950 --> 00:56:22,760
離開黑暗 過正常人的生活
finishing about a light on that awful cave.

742
00:56:22,860 --> 00:56:26,880
Alfred, Rachel死之前我們已經決定在一起
Alfred, Rachel died knowing that we had decided to be together.

743
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:28,180
我曾有過機會過正常生活
That was my life, beyond the cave.

744
00:56:28,270 --> 00:56:30,840
我現在依然沒辦法放下
I can't just move on.

745
00:56:30,950 --> 00:56:34,490
她本應該得到更好的
She didn't, she couldn't have.

746
00:56:34,540 --> 00:56:37,750
- 要是她已經得到了呢  - 你知道現在說什麼都晚了
- What did she had? - You know I can't change that.

747
00:56:37,850 --> 00:56:40,900
如果 在她死之前 她寫了一封信
And if, before she died, she wrote a letter

748
00:56:40,990 --> 00:56:45,390
信中說她選擇了Harvey Dent而不是你
saying she chose Harvey Dent over you?

749
00:56:48,630 --> 00:56:53,420
而我為了減少你的痛苦
And what if to spare your pain....

750
00:56:54,750 --> 00:56:57,560
燒掉了那封信
I burned that letter ...?

751
00:56:57,800 --> 00:57:02,040
你怎麼敢用Rachel來阻擋我
How dare you use Rachel to try and stop me.

752
00:57:02,130 --> 00:57:05,280
我習慣了選擇Wayne主人
I am using to choose Master Wayne.

753
00:57:06,010 --> 00:57:12,160
也許是時候我們開始嘗試看清真相 就讓它這麼赤裸裸地呈現著
Maybe it's time we all start trying to out smart the truth and let it have it stay.

754
00:57:12,360 --> 00:57:14,630
- 我很抱歉 - 你很抱歉
- I'm sorry. - You're sorry?

755
00:57:14,740 --> 00:57:18,200
你想摧毀我的世界
You expect to destroy my world ...

756
00:57:19,590 --> 00:57:22,690
然後你覺得我們就這樣握手言和嗎
... and then think we're going to shake hands?

757
00:57:22,800 --> 00:57:24,810
不會
No.

758
00:57:24,930 --> 00:57:28,810
- 我知道這代表了什麼 - 這代表了什麼
- I know what this means. - What is it means?

759
00:57:28,900 --> 00:57:34,250
這代表了你對我的憎恨 和失去
It means your hatred and it also mean losing someone.

760
00:57:34,250 --> 00:57:36,910
一個從他的第一聲啼哭迴響這房子裡
Who I've cared kept for since I first heard

761
00:57:37,030 --> 00:57:42,680
我便在乎的人
his cries echoes through this house.

762
00:57:42,920 --> 00:57:48,070
但這也許也意味著拯救你的生命
But it might also mean saving your life.

763
00:57:48,290 --> 00:57:52,030
這才是更重要的
And that's more important.

764
00:57:55,980 --> 00:57:58,460
再見 Alfred
Good bye, Alfred!

765
00:58:16,950 --> 00:58:19,380
Alfred
Alfred?

766
00:58:23,210 --> 00:58:25,660
- 你親自來開門啊 - 是啊
- Answering your own door? - Yeah.

767
00:58:27,120 --> 00:58:28,910
第三頁
Page three.

768
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:30,530
看來你為公司的期貨交易
Seem you made a series a

769
00:58:30,530 --> 00:58:33,210
做了一系列決定
laud of put options on the future exchange.

770
00:58:33,310 --> 00:58:34,840
通過指紋驗證
Verified by thumb print.

771
00:58:34,950 --> 00:58:37,900
這些期權自昨晚午夜起失效
Those options expired at midnight last night.

772
00:58:37,900 --> 00:58:40,820
再多些時間我們也許能證明它是個騙局 但現在
Long term we may be able to prove it was a fraud but for now,

773
00:58:40,820 --> 00:58:42,260
你徹底破產了
you're completely broke.

774
00:58:42,420 --> 00:58:43,710
而Wayne集團
and Wayne Enterprises is

775
00:58:43,710 --> 00:58:46,130
將會落入John Daggett之手
about to fall into the hands of John Daggett.

776
00:58:46,290 --> 00:58:47,710
那些武器
The weapons ...

777
00:58:47,820 --> 00:58:50,210
我們不能讓Daggett插手到那些武器中
We can't let Daggett get his hands on the applied sciences.

778
00:58:50,300 --> 00:58:53,340
那些武器是完全對外封鎖 不入記錄的
Applied sciences is all lock up and off the books.

779
00:58:53,430 --> 00:58:56,540
但能源項目又是另一回事了
The energy project however is a different story.

780
00:58:56,630 --> 00:58:58,430
Miranda Tate
Miranda Tate ...

781
00:58:59,220 --> 00:59:01,780
我們要說服董事會支持她
We need to convince the board to get behind her.

782
00:59:01,780 --> 00:59:03,160
給她看看核反應堆
Let's show her the reactor.

783
00:59:03,160 --> 00:59:06,060
我們在35分鐘內跟她在那兒會面 你最好穿戴好
We're meeting her there in 35 minutes so you better get dressed.

784
00:59:06,270 --> 00:59:09,500
你帶我來這兒是給我看這個嗎 Fox先生
You brought me out here to show me this, Mr. Fox?

785
00:59:09,790 --> 00:59:12,450
稍安勿躁 Tate小姐
Bear with me, Miss Tate.

786
00:59:16,060 --> 00:59:19,950
請不要把手腳伸到車外
Please keep hands and feet in the car at all time.

787
00:59:25,120 --> 00:59:27,420
就是這裡 對吧
This is it, isn't it?

788
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:30,190
核反應堆在河床下面
The reactor is beneath the river

789
00:59:30,190 --> 00:59:34,160
這樣如果出了安全問題 就能立刻被河水淹沒
So it can be instantly flooded in an event of a security breach.

790
00:59:34,300 --> 00:59:38,210
Bruce Wayne真的那麼疑神疑鬼嗎
Is Bruce Wayne really that paranoid?

791
00:59:38,300 --> 00:59:40,930
對於這個問題 我保留意見
I fail to give an answer on that one.

792
00:59:47,270 --> 00:59:50,970
你可能想知道你的投資都在什麼項目上
I thought you might like to see what your investment builds.

793
00:59:50,970 --> 00:59:55,340
不用礦石燃料的清潔能源 能供給整個城市
No fossil fuels, free clean energy for an entire city!

794
00:59:55,340 --> 00:59:58,690
三年前 有個俄羅斯的科學家發表了一篇論文
Three years ago, a Russian scientist published

795
00:59:58,690 --> 01:00:01,570
內容是將熱核反應製成武器
a paper on weaponize fusion reactions.

796
01:00:01,660 --> 01:00:06,860
一周之後 你的反應堆就開始出問題
One week later, your reactor started developing problems.

797
01:00:07,030 --> 01:00:09,380
我覺得這機器是成功了才對
I think this machine works.

798
01:00:09,510 --> 01:00:12,700
Miranda 如果這機器能夠正常運轉
Miranda, if it were operational,

799
01:00:12,700 --> 01:00:16,290
才是對哥譚市最大的威脅
danger to Gotham would be too great.

800
01:00:16,390 --> 01:00:19,650
那要是你聽說那個俄國科學家在半年前的
Would it make you feel better to know that the Russian

801
01:00:19,650 --> 01:00:22,500
一次飛行事故中去世了會好受些嘛
scientist died in a plane crash six months ago?

802
01:00:22,630 --> 01:00:26,260
總有人會和Pavel博士一樣努力研究
Someone been working hard with Dr. Pavel.

803
01:00:26,380 --> 01:00:29,380
總有人會搞清楚如何把這能源
Someone will figured out the way for make

804
01:00:29,380 --> 01:00:32,380
製成一個核武器
this power source into a nuclear weapon.

805
01:00:33,680 --> 01:00:39,970
我要你來掌控韋恩集團和這個反應堆
I need you to take control of Wayne Enterprises and this reactor.

806
01:00:40,070 --> 01:00:42,510
- 要用它做什麼? - 什麼都不做
- To do what with it? - Nothing.

807
01:00:43,350 --> 01:00:47,030
- 除非我們能夠保證其安全性 - 那要是我們做不到呢
- Until we can guarantee it's safety. - And if we can't?

808
01:00:47,140 --> 01:00:48,790
那就摧毀它 用水淹了
Decommission it, flood it.

809
01:00:48,920 --> 01:00:52,730
要把這世界可能擁有的可持續能源的美好將來摧毀掉
Destroy the world's best chance for a sustainable future?

810
01:00:52,830 --> 01:00:54,520
這個世界還沒有準備好使用這能源 所以是的
The world is not ready, yes.

811
01:00:54,670 --> 01:00:56,040
Bruce 你要是想拯救世界
Bruce, if you want to

812
01:00:56,040 --> 01:00:58,980
首先得要相信這個世界啊
save the world you have to start trusting it.

813
01:00:59,120 --> 01:01:00,070
我不是信你麼
I'm trusting you.

814
01:01:00,070 --> 01:01:02,710
這不算 你沒得選
It doesn't count. You have no choice.

815
01:01:02,850 --> 01:01:03,880
我大可在過去的三年裡
I could've flooded this

816
01:01:03,880 --> 01:01:05,840
直接淹了這能量室
chamber at any time in the last three years.

817
01:01:05,960 --> 01:01:10,150
我選擇相信你 所以拜託
I choosing to trust you. Please ...

818
01:01:17,460 --> 01:01:19,290
好了女士們先生們
Alright ladies and gentlemen,

819
01:01:19,290 --> 01:01:21,560
這場會議該好好進行了
this meeting will now come to order.

820
01:01:21,660 --> 01:01:22,740
我想先指出一下
You know, I would like to

821
01:01:22,740 --> 01:01:24,760
我們這兒有一位非董事會的成員在座
point out that we have a non-board member here.

822
01:01:24,850 --> 01:01:28,450
這太不合規矩了 即使說他的名字在門上的招牌裡
There is highly irregular, even if his name is above the door.

823
01:01:28,550 --> 01:01:30,750
Bruce Wayne家族創立了這個企業
Bruce Wayne's family built this company.

824
01:01:30,850 --> 01:01:34,940
- 而他自己也運營者它 - 他把公司給運營垮了 先生
- and he himself has run it ... - Into the ground, sir!

825
01:01:35,040 --> 01:01:36,140
有誰不同意麼
Does anybody disagrees?

826
01:01:36,240 --> 01:01:37,540
你們都去看看今早的股價
Check the share prices this morning.

827
01:01:37,640 --> 01:01:42,800
對於未來的瘋狂投機不但耗掉了Wayne先生自己的職位
Crazy gambling on future not only cost Mr. Wayne his seat,

828
01:01:42,800 --> 01:01:47,140
同樣還把好多我們的錢也一起賠進去了 所以他必須得離開
it has cost us all a lot of money and he has to go.

829
01:01:47,240 --> 01:01:50,340
我恐怕他說得有道理 Wayne先生
I'm afraid he has a point, Mr. Wayne.

830
01:01:57,740 --> 01:01:59,440
那我們說正題吧
Well back to business.

831
01:02:01,140 --> 01:02:02,840
Wayne先生 重新做回一個普通人您感覺如何
How does it feel to be one of the people, Wayne?

832
01:02:02,940 --> 01:02:04,740
Wayne先生 他們把您的車給拖走了
Mr. Wayne, they're towing your car..

833
01:02:04,840 --> 01:02:06,850
我不知道你已經被踢出董事會了
I didn't know that you're off the board.

834
01:02:09,170 --> 01:02:10,760
你看上去需要搭個車
Looks like you'll need a ride huh?

835
01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:13,530
Wayne先生 你想要搭車麼
Mr. Wayne, will you get a ride?

836
01:02:13,660 --> 01:02:15,010
那該死的Miranda Tate是怎麼
What the hell did Miranda Tate

837
01:02:15,010 --> 01:02:17,450
打入Wayne集團董事會的
get the inside track on the Wayne Board?

838
01:02:17,550 --> 01:02:19,300
她難道一直和他在見面
I mean, is she been meeting with him?

839
01:02:19,300 --> 01:02:20,000
她是在和他上床嗎
Is she been sleeping with him?

840
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:20,740
就我們所知並沒有
Not that we know of.

841
01:02:20,850 --> 01:02:23,870
得了吧 你根本也就不知道多少是吧 Bane在哪兒
Oh clearly you don't know much of anything, do you? Where's Bane?

842
01:02:23,950 --> 01:02:26,290
- 你和他說過事關緊急了嗎 - 那他人在哪兒呢
- You told him it was urgent. - Where is that man now?

843
01:02:26,370 --> 01:02:29,910
說曹操 曹操就到
Speak of the devil, and he shall appears.

844
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:33,070
這他媽都是怎麼回事
What the hell is going on?

845
01:02:33,310 --> 01:02:36,210
一切正如計劃進行中啊
The plan is preceding as expected.

846
01:02:36,310 --> 01:02:40,350
是麼 我看上去像是已經執掌Wayne集團的樣子嘛
Really? Do I look like I'm running Wayne Enterprises right now?

847
01:02:40,460 --> 01:02:45,350
你襲擊了證券交易所 可那沒成功啊 我的朋友
Your hit on the stock exchange, it didn't work my friend.

848
01:02:45,350 --> 01:02:47,040
然後現在你又讓我的工程隊
And now you have my construction crews

849
01:02:47,040 --> 01:02:50,210
在城裡24小時到處開工
going around the city at 24 hours a day.

850
01:02:50,320 --> 01:02:55,840
這到底算哪門子的幫助我吞掉Wayne集團呢
How exactly is that suppose to help my company absorbs Wayne?

851
01:02:57,930 --> 01:03:00,490
- 退下 - 不用 你就待在這兒
- Leave us! - No! Stay here!

852
01:03:00,590 --> 01:03:02,210
我才是這兒管事的人
I'm in charge here.

853
01:03:02,870 --> 01:03:06,260
你覺得自己像麼
Do you feel in charge?

854
01:03:10,280 --> 01:03:12,060
我可是給了你不少錢
I have paid you a small fortune.

855
01:03:12,230 --> 01:03:15,470
所以你就以為自己可以壓過我了
And this gives you power over me?

856
01:03:15,760 --> 01:03:17,200
你什麼意思
What is this?

857
01:03:17,330 --> 01:03:22,700
你的錢還有工程隊起的作用真的很重要
Your money and infrastructure have been important ...

858
01:03:22,800 --> 01:03:24,350
不過現在已經沒用了
... until now.

859
01:03:24,420 --> 01:03:27,500
- 你到底是什麼東西 - 我就是哥譚市的審判日
- What are you? - I'm Gotham reckoning.

860
01:03:27,610 --> 01:03:31,100
它會將你們所生活的一切終結
It'll end of all the damn you've been living on.

861
01:03:32,530 --> 01:03:35,730
你太邪惡了
You are pure evil.

862
01:03:35,750 --> 01:03:38,790
- 這是必要的嘛 - 不要
- A necessary evil. - No!

863
01:03:44,770 --> 01:03:47,330
你惹了不小的麻煩
Well you've started quite a mess.

864
01:03:47,490 --> 01:03:49,210
我只是要保護自己親近的人而已
To protect the people closes to me.

865
01:03:49,290 --> 01:03:51,160
也許你的確是個獨行俠 你沒有家庭
Maybe you're a loner, right? You didn't have a family.

866
01:03:51,270 --> 01:03:53,270
你還是有關心在乎的人啊
There are always people that you care about.

867
01:03:55,300 --> 01:03:57,860
可你就是要等到他們都不見了才意識到這點
But you didn't realize how much until they're gone.

868
01:03:57,940 --> 01:04:00,850
這只是一個象徵性的概念
The idea was to be a symbol.

869
01:04:00,950 --> 01:04:06,320
任何人都可以是蝙蝠俠 那才是重點
Batman can be anyone. That was the point.

870
01:04:06,500 --> 01:04:09,720
- 那他回來真是件大好事 - 可不是每個人都這麼想
- Well it damn good to see him back. - Not everybody agrees.

871
01:04:09,830 --> 01:04:11,520
我最終會搞明白的
I'll figured that out in the end.

872
01:04:11,530 --> 01:04:14,290
你查到Bane的行蹤了嘛
Do you got anything on Bane's whereabouts?

873
01:04:14,730 --> 01:04:18,010
是啊 我手上有500頁的地下通道地圖和一把手電筒
Yes, I have 500 pages of tunnel records and a flashlight.

874
01:04:18,100 --> 01:04:19,830
我真的很需要人幫忙
I could use some help actually.

875
01:04:21,200 --> 01:04:23,140
這樣吧 你就在老城區那裡放我下車吧
You know what, drop me in the old town.

876
01:04:27,580 --> 01:04:30,440
- 我不這麼想 - 這樣的話事情不會成功的
- I don't think so! - That is not how it works.

877
01:04:30,520 --> 01:04:32,590
他不是目標
He's not a mark.

878
01:04:32,700 --> 01:04:35,440
反正他的名號現在一分錢都不值
and he doesn't have a cent to his name anyway.

879
01:04:36,080 --> 01:04:40,220
的確是不多 不過也總比你現在要好吧
Yeah. It's not much, but it's more than you got right now.

880
01:04:40,370 --> 01:04:43,190
事實上 他們沒把我的房子收走
Actually, they're letting me keep the house.

881
01:04:43,300 --> 01:04:45,970
有錢人就算是破了產還是和我們不一樣是吧
The rich doesn't even go broke like the rest of us huh?

882
01:04:46,080 --> 01:04:50,190
我那個厲害的朋友希望你能回心轉意不要走
My powerful friend might hope to change your mind about leaving.

883
01:04:50,290 --> 01:04:52,750
- 那他準備怎麼做 - 他準備把你想要的東西給你
- And how would he do that? - By giving you what you want.

884
01:04:52,900 --> 01:04:55,970
- 那東西不存在 - 他說存在
- It doesn't exist. - He says it does.

885
01:04:56,120 --> 01:04:58,820
- 他還說想在今晚和你見面 - 為什麼
- He wants to meet tonight. - Why?

886
01:04:58,960 --> 01:05:02,990
他想找到Bane 然後說你知道怎麼找到他
He needs to find Bane. He says you know how.

887
01:05:05,730 --> 01:05:10,010
- 告訴他我會考慮的 - 好的 我挺喜歡你這地方的
- Tell him I'll think about it. - Okay. I like your place.

888
01:05:11,510 --> 01:05:13,580
Wayne先生
Mr. Wayne!

889
01:05:15,140 --> 01:05:18,030
我很抱歉他們把你的錢都奪走了
I'm sorry they took all your money.

890
01:05:18,440 --> 01:05:20,580
不 你才不抱歉
No you're not.

891
01:05:20,990 --> 01:05:23,410
- 我們有什麼能幫到你麼警官 - 有啊
- Can we help you officer? - Yeah.

892
01:05:23,520 --> 01:05:26,330
在一小時前John Daggett的屍體在一個垃圾箱裡被找到了
John Daggett's body was found in a dumpster an hour ago.

893
01:05:26,330 --> 01:05:28,800
我以為你會想知道
Thought you might wanna know.

894
01:05:28,930 --> 01:05:29,950
為什麼
Why?

895
01:05:29,960 --> 01:05:31,780
因為在哥譚市半數的隧道許可證上
Well his name is all over this permit I just

896
01:05:31,780 --> 01:05:33,440
全都有他的名字
pulled to half the tunnel under Gotham.

897
01:05:33,570 --> 01:05:37,620
都是些交通維護 下水道建設還有其他的事由
That's MTA maintenance, sewer construction and others things...

898
01:05:37,730 --> 01:05:39,960
你從這隧道裡研究出什麼來了
What did you get with the tunnel searches?

899
01:05:41,020 --> 01:05:44,270
提醒我得把這愣頭青給踢走
Remind me to tell detail to keep hot heads out.

900
01:05:44,350 --> 01:05:46,510
我們在那下面有一隊人 那是一個龐大的網絡
We had teams down there. It's a huge network.

901
01:05:46,510 --> 01:05:47,970
那再多派些人
Well get more then.

902
01:05:48,050 --> 01:05:50,000
就走這條線索 我要找到他
Work the grid. I want him found.

903
01:05:50,090 --> 01:05:52,450
是的 那個面具男 我們這就去
Yeah, the masked man. We're on it.

904
01:05:52,540 --> 01:05:55,370
把制服脫了 你現在跟我了
Lose the uniform. You』re working for me now.

905
01:05:55,490 --> 01:05:57,910
我們現在可是需要些愣頭青
We could some hot head around here.

906
01:05:58,060 --> 01:05:59,770
長官 Daggett的死因不會只是個巧合
Sir, Daggett's death could only be a coincidence.

907
01:05:59,880 --> 01:06:01,650
你現在是個警探了孩子
You're a detective now, son.

908
01:06:01,800 --> 01:06:05,610
已經不能再相信巧合這種事情的存在了
You're not allowed to believe in coincidences anymore.

909
01:06:16,780 --> 01:06:19,910
- 沒人應門 - 沒有
- Nobody's answering. - No ...

910
01:06:20,010 --> 01:06:24,230
- 現在就我一個人了 - 你有鑰匙麼
- I'm on my own now. - Do you have keys?

911
01:06:25,090 --> 01:06:26,700
我從來沒使用過
I never needed them.

912
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,270
我希望你不介意用我的錢
I hope you didn't liked reaching my money.

913
01:06:35,310 --> 01:06:37,610
要遭這樣的罪
Suffering this character.

914
01:06:44,110 --> 01:06:47,300
Bruce 我會好好照管你父母的心血
I'll take care of your parents legacy, Bruce.

915
01:06:48,800 --> 01:06:50,900
是誰
Who's this?

916
01:06:57,800 --> 01:06:59,690
Alfred去哪兒了
Where is Alfred?

917
01:07:00,990 --> 01:07:02,890
他走了
He left.

918
01:07:04,200 --> 01:07:06,100
還把所有東西都
...taking everything...

919
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:35,000
- 那是什麼 - 我們剛剛好像斷電了
- What's that? - Our power has been shut off.

920
01:07:40,100 --> 01:07:42,190
你很會生火啊
You're good at that.

921
01:07:42,500 --> 01:07:45,300
我小時候 家裡一貧如洗
When I was a child, we had almost nothing.

922
01:07:45,400 --> 01:07:51,200
可每當夜晚我們生起火 就會覺得好像無比富有
But on the nights when we had a fire, We felt very rich indeed...

923
01:07:52,200 --> 01:07:55,610
我原以為你家境殷實
I assumed your family was wealthy.

924
01:07:56,010 --> 01:08:00,110
我小時候那會兒還沒有
Not always not when I was young.

925
01:08:00,710 --> 01:08:05,390
- 那是個老錯了 - 我自己也犯過
- It's an old mistake. - I had a few myself.

926
01:08:06,700 --> 01:08:09,100
還不止一兩個
More than a few.

927
01:08:10,700 --> 01:08:14,290
我們可以今晚就走
I could leave tonight.

928
01:08:14,490 --> 01:08:19,100
坐我的飛機去我們想去的地方
Take my plane and go anywhere we wanted.

929
01:08:20,310 --> 01:08:24,600
也許等將來哪天吧 今晚不行
Some day perhaps. Not tonight.

930
01:08:52,900 --> 01:08:55,000
別害羞啊
Don't be shy!

931
01:08:56,800 --> 01:08:59,210
Wayne說你可以把"清洗程序"給我
Wayne said that you can get me the 'Clean Slate'.

932
01:08:59,410 --> 01:09:02,510
- 那要看 - 看什麼
- That depends ... - On what?

933
01:09:02,610 --> 01:09:04,200
看你想用它做什麼事
On what you want it for..

934
01:09:04,300 --> 01:09:07,400
我要確保它不會落入錯誤之手
I have acquire it to keep it out of the wrong hands.

935
01:09:07,500 --> 01:09:10,000
還是不信任我是吧
Still don't trust me huh...

936
01:09:10,200 --> 01:09:15,120
- 我們要怎麼改變這點呢 - 就從帶我去見Bane開始
- How can we change that? - Start by taking me to Bane.

937
01:09:18,060 --> 01:09:19,840
是你要求的
You asked...

938
01:09:21,720 --> 01:09:24,190
從這裡開始 Bane的人會巡查隧道
From here, Bane's man patrol the tunnels

939
01:09:24,190 --> 01:09:26,480
而他們可不是你平時打架消遣的對象
and they're not your average brawlers.

940
01:09:27,120 --> 01:09:28,760
我也不是
Neither am I.

941
01:09:36,350 --> 01:09:37,400
- 他在你後面 - 誰
- He's behind you! - Who?

942
01:09:37,470 --> 01:09:38,960
我
Me!

943
01:09:43,910 --> 01:09:45,290
你以為自己在往哪兒走
Where do you think you're going? ...

944
01:09:58,090 --> 01:09:59,850
別這麼霸氣
Less a little bully.

945
01:10:07,340 --> 01:10:10,090
我總要想辦法不讓他們殺了我吧
I had to find a way to stop them trying to kill me.

946
01:10:10,200 --> 01:10:12,900
你犯了一個嚴重的錯誤
You made a serious mistake.

947
01:10:12,990 --> 01:10:16,120
恐怕沒有你犯的
Not as serious as yours ...

948
01:10:16,190 --> 01:10:18,350
要嚴重
... I fear.

949
01:10:21,300 --> 01:10:26,400
- Bane - 我們可別就這麼站著啊
- Bane ... - Let's not stand on so moody here.

950
01:10:27,100 --> 01:10:30,080
Wayne先生
Mr. Wayne ...

951
01:10:40,800 --> 01:10:42,700
平靜削弱你
Peace has cost you your strength.

952
01:10:42,800 --> 01:10:45,280
勝利擊垮你
Victory has defeated you.

953
01:11:46,870 --> 01:11:49,630
這些謊言欺詐
The adaptability and deception ...

954
01:11:49,740 --> 01:11:52,470
只能蒙蔽那些無知的人
powerful agents ... to the uninitiated people.

955
01:11:52,560 --> 01:11:56,210
只有我們心知肚明 不是麼 Bruce
But we are initiated aren't we, Bruce?

956
01:11:56,300 --> 01:11:58,970
我們都是影武者聯盟的一員
Members of the League of Shadows.

957
01:12:01,140 --> 01:12:03,540
可你背叛了我們
And you betrayed us.

958
01:12:04,520 --> 01:12:10,270
是啊 你被一群精神變態們給驅逐了
Yes. You were excommunicated by a gang of psychopaths.

959
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:17,310
我 就是影武者
I am the League of Shadows.

960
01:12:17,400 --> 01:12:21,340
我來到這裡是為了完成忍者大師的遺志
I'm here to fulfill Ra's Al Ghul's destiny!

961
01:12:34,250 --> 01:12:38,470
你打起來倒像是個年輕人 完全不留後路
You fight like a younger man, there's nothing held back.

962
01:12:38,820 --> 01:12:42,890
很可敬 不過也是個錯誤
It's admirable, but mistaken.

963
01:12:46,480 --> 01:12:50,120
你以為黑暗是站在你一邊的嗎
You think darkness is your ally?

964
01:12:50,210 --> 01:12:56,030
你僅僅只是適應了黑暗 而我是因黑暗而生
You've merely adopted the dark, I was born in it.

965
01:12:56,160 --> 01:12:59,360
由黑暗而鑄
Molded by it ...

966
01:12:59,550 --> 01:13:02,930
直到成年以後 我才得見天日
I didn't see the light until I was already a man.

967
01:13:03,060 --> 01:13:06,090
但我只覺得光明很刺眼
By then was nothing to be blinded.

968
01:13:08,650 --> 01:13:13,150
暗影背棄了你 是因為他們屬於我
Shadows betray you because they belong to me!

969
01:13:17,940 --> 01:13:21,540
讓我來告訴你我是以何處為家的吧
I'll show you where I had made my home.

970
01:13:21,640 --> 01:13:25,240
在準備著審判之時
Whilst preparing to bring justice.

971
01:13:27,180 --> 01:13:29,880
我會擊潰你
Then I will break you.

972
01:13:38,130 --> 01:13:42,350
你那珍貴的軍庫 我就不客氣的收下了
Your precious armory! Great fully accepted.

973
01:13:42,450 --> 01:13:44,750
我們會需要用到的
We'll need it.

974
01:13:53,020 --> 01:13:57,020
啊是的 我一直在好奇是哪一樣東西會更先崩潰
Ah yes! I was wondering what would weight first...

975
01:14:01,210 --> 01:14:03,300
是你的精神
Your spirit ...

976
01:14:07,370 --> 01:14:09,480
還是你的肉體
... or your body?

977
01:14:53,180 --> 01:14:54,390
請給我接Gordon局長
Get me Commissioner Gordon.

978
01:14:54,480 --> 01:14:56,490
關於議員被綁一案我有了一條線索
I got a line up of Congressman's kidnapping.

979
01:15:09,180 --> 01:15:10,580
- 不好意思 小姐 - 什麼
- Excuse me, miss! - Yes?

980
01:15:10,680 --> 01:15:13,890
我需要檢查您的機票和證件
I'm going to need to see your ticket and identification, please.

981
01:15:14,190 --> 01:15:16,690
不介意幫我拿下嗎
Do you mind?

982
01:15:28,790 --> 01:15:31,690
我把你的照片給議員看了 猜猜怎麼著
I showed your picture to The Congressman. Guess what?!

983
01:15:32,090 --> 01:15:36,090
- 不要告訴我 他還想著我 - 神魂顛倒
- Don't tell me. Still in love? - Oh head over heels.

984
01:15:36,290 --> 01:15:37,990
不過還是準備起訴你
Pressing charges though.

985
01:15:38,190 --> 01:15:41,880
你犯了些錯啊 Kyle小姐
You've made some mistakes, Miss Kyle.

986
01:15:42,080 --> 01:15:45,880
- 姑娘家也要討生活嘛 - 喲你胃口可真好
- Girl's got to eat. - And you have an appetite.

987
01:15:45,980 --> 01:15:48,280
為什麼要逃 你這樣的犯罪記錄是逃不掉的
Why would run? You can't hide from us with a record like this.

988
01:15:48,380 --> 01:15:52,600
- 也許我不是在躲你呢 - 那你在躲誰 Bane嘛
- Maybe it's not you I'm running from. - Who then? Bane?

989
01:15:52,700 --> 01:15:54,290
你對他瞭解多少
What do you know about him?

990
01:15:54,390 --> 01:15:58,280
我只知道你應該像我一樣害怕他
About you should be as afraid of him as I am.

991
01:15:58,380 --> 01:16:00,480
我們可以給你提供保護
We can offer you protection.

992
01:16:03,390 --> 01:16:05,090
好吧
Okay ...

993
01:16:09,180 --> 01:16:10,820
我發現你的時候 其實
When I spotted you,

994
01:16:10,830 --> 01:16:13,580
我是在找我的一個朋友 Bruce Wayne
 I was looking for a friend of mine, Bruce Wayne.

995
01:16:15,620 --> 01:16:17,420
他死了嗎
Did that killed him?

996
01:16:18,920 --> 01:16:21,120
我不確定
I'm not sure.

997
01:16:40,510 --> 01:16:45,340
為什麼不直接殺了我
Why didn't you just kill me?

998
01:16:45,370 --> 01:16:49,410
你不怕死 你渴望死亡
You don't fear death, you welcome it.

999
01:16:49,410 --> 01:16:52,620
你會在這裡接受懲罰
Your punishment must be mastered here.

1000
01:16:52,620 --> 01:16:56,130
- 你要慢慢折磨我 - 是的
- torture? - Yes.

1001
01:16:56,690 --> 01:17:00,010
但不是折磨你的身體
But not of your body.

1002
01:17:02,600 --> 01:17:04,790
而是你的靈魂
Of your soul.

1003
01:17:04,790 --> 01:17:08,980
- 我在哪兒 - 家
- Where am I? - Home.

1004
01:17:08,980 --> 01:17:14,870
在這兒我領悟了什麼是真正的絕望 你也會的
Where I learned the truth about despair, as will you.

1005
01:17:14,900 --> 01:17:19,300
這個監獄被稱為人間地獄是有原因的
There's a reason why this prison were a hell on earth.

1006
01:17:19,300 --> 01:17:21,050
希望
Hope.

1007
01:17:21,050 --> 01:17:22,320
幾個世紀以來
Every man who has lotted

1008
01:17:22,320 --> 01:17:24,760
每個收押於此的犯人抬頭看著亮光
here over the centuries looked up to the light

1009
01:17:24,760 --> 01:17:28,480
想像著攀向自由
and imagine climbing to freedom.

1010
01:17:28,480 --> 01:17:33,150
多容易 多簡單
So easy, so simple!

1011
01:17:33,150 --> 01:17:35,050
除非有的人
Unless you break man

1012
01:17:35,050 --> 01:17:39,400
真的一蹶不振
turning into seawater for uncontrollably fast.

1013
01:17:40,750 --> 01:17:43,550
很多人死於嘗試
Many have died trying.

1014
01:17:43,550 --> 01:17:48,680
沒有希望就沒有真正的絕望
And then here can be no true despair without hope.

1015
01:17:48,680 --> 01:17:52,160
所以在我恐嚇哥譚的同時
So as I terrorize Gotham,

1016
01:17:52,160 --> 01:17:55,700
我會用希望毒害他們的靈魂
I will feed it's deeper hole to poison their souls.

1017
01:17:56,400 --> 01:17:59,210
我會讓他們相信他們能活下去
I would let them live so they can survived

1018
01:17:59,210 --> 01:18:02,470
這樣你就能看著他們自相殘殺
and you can watch them trampling over each other

1019
01:18:02,470 --> 01:18:05,770
只為了一絲生的希望
... to stay in the sun.

1020
01:18:07,920 --> 01:18:11,640
你能目睹我折磨著整個城市
You could watch me torturing an entire city.

1021
01:18:11,640 --> 01:18:15,890
等你真正明白你有多麼失敗的時候
And then when you truly understood the depth of your failure,

1022
01:18:15,890 --> 01:18:18,640
我們會完成忍者大師的使命
we will fulfill Ra's Al Ghu's destiny.

1023
01:18:22,290 --> 01:18:25,410
我們會毀滅哥譚
We will destroy Gotham.

1024
01:18:26,130 --> 01:18:33,630
你會親眼目睹哥譚化為灰燼 無能為力
and then, what would you've done, when Gotham is ashes ...

1025
01:18:38,910 --> 01:18:42,550
那時 我才准許你死
Then you have my permission to die.

1026
01:18:55,900 --> 01:18:57,620
你要把她關在這兒?
You're locking her up in here?

1027
01:18:57,660 --> 01:19:01,540
丹特法案允許某些特殊情況下男女無需隔離
The Dent's act allowed non-segregation based extraordinary needs.

1028
01:19:01,540 --> 01:19:04,590
她第一次逃出女子勞教所時才16歲
First time she broke out of women correctional, she was 16.

1029
01:19:04,690 --> 01:19:08,980
- 靠近點兒 甜心 - 怎麼了甜心 你想牽我的手嗎
- A little closer, honey! - Why honey? You want to hold my hand?

1030
01:19:09,370 --> 01:19:11,210
她沒事的
She's going to be fine.

1031
01:19:11,910 --> 01:19:13,000
我還是不明白
I still don't see the need

1032
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:14,770
為什麼董事會要為了能源項目開會
of a board meeting for the energy project.

1033
01:19:14,770 --> 01:19:16,340
Bruce做過很多正確的事
Bruce got a lot of things right,

1034
01:19:16,340 --> 01:19:18,940
把董事會瞞在鼓裡可不是其中之一
keeping the board in the dark was not one of them.

1035
01:19:21,740 --> 01:19:26,600
哦 你能來加入我們真好 主席
Oh good of you to join us Chair President.

1036
01:19:26,600 --> 01:19:30,260
現在我只需要再來個常任董事會成員就夠了
All I need now is one more Ordinary Board member.

1037
01:19:30,320 --> 01:19:37,300
- Fox先生 你想提名嗎 - 不 我自願
- Mr. Fox, would you like to nominate? - No. I will volunteer.

1038
01:19:37,330 --> 01:19:39,600
你要把我們帶到哪兒去
Where are you taking us?

1039
01:19:49,620 --> 01:19:50,960
你是對的 局長
You were right, Commissioner!

1040
01:19:51,170 --> 01:19:52,750
可以讓我們單獨談談嗎
Would you excuses us, please?

1041
01:19:52,750 --> 01:19:53,790
發生了什麼
What happened?

1042
01:19:53,920 --> 01:19:56,270
你那些面具男綁架了韋恩集團的董事會
Your mask man kidnapped the Wayne Enterprise's Board.

1043
01:19:56,270 --> 01:19:57,390
他把大部分人放走了
He let most of them go,

1044
01:19:57,400 --> 01:19:59,450
但帶了三個去下水道
but he took three of them into the sewers.

1045
01:19:59,450 --> 01:20:01,650
別再巡邏了 別再玩捉迷藏了
No more patrols. No more hide and seek.

1046
01:20:01,650 --> 01:20:04,680
把每個能用的警察都召集起來 全力抓他
Get every available cop down there and smoke him out.

1047
01:20:04,680 --> 01:20:08,950
- 市長不想製造恐慌的 - 那就說是演習
- The Mayor won't want panic. - So it's a training exercise?

1048
01:20:10,670 --> 01:20:13,490
我很抱歉我之前沒有相信你
I'm sorry I didn't take you seriously.

1049
01:20:13,500 --> 01:20:17,490
你別走 你告訴我蝙蝠俠已不在
Not you, you telling me The Batman have gone.

1050
01:20:17,490 --> 01:20:22,620
那麼你就去用盡一切辦法追查蛛絲馬跡
So you chase up the daggers leads anyway you can.

1051
01:20:22,620 --> 01:20:24,070
遵命 長官
Yes, sir.

1052
01:20:33,640 --> 01:20:39,290
他問 你付多少錢求我們殺了你
He asks how you much would pay us to let you die?

1053
01:20:39,290 --> 01:20:42,130
我跟他說 我跟他說你身無一物
I told him...I told him you have nothing.

1054
01:20:42,140 --> 01:20:43,760
你跟他說 我求之不得
You tell them pleasure!

1055
01:20:43,760 --> 01:20:48,030
有人付給我更多錢來保你活命
he paid more than that to keep you alive.

1056
01:20:54,640 --> 01:20:57,050
你會試著爬出去
You would try to climb.

1057
01:21:10,820 --> 01:21:13,930
他能成功嗎 每個人都會嗎
He can win? Everybody has?

1058
01:21:13,940 --> 01:21:16,770
當然不是了
Well of course not!

1059
01:21:26,160 --> 01:21:29,350
他說有一個曾經爬了出去
He say there's one who did.

1060
01:21:29,360 --> 01:21:31,190
一個孩子
A child.

1061
01:21:32,490 --> 01:21:35,350
一個生於地獄的孩子
A child born in this hell.

1062
01:21:35,550 --> 01:21:40,240
- Bane - 那只是一個古老的傳說罷了
- Bane ... - An old legend. Nothing more.

1063
01:21:43,930 --> 01:21:44,940
給我說說
Tell me

1064
01:21:45,160 --> 01:21:50,330
看看電視吧 你關心的事馬上就要開始了
What they really tease me, you wanted to see is happening soon.

1065
01:22:15,520 --> 01:22:17,790
爆破
Fire in the hole!

1066
01:22:45,370 --> 01:22:47,390
把它打開
Turn it on!

1067
01:22:51,170 --> 01:22:53,730
我只需要一個董事成員
I only need one other Board member,

1068
01:22:53,730 --> 01:22:56,000
還有八個等著呢
there are eight others waiting.

1069
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:57,590
我不幹
I won't do it.

1070
01:22:58,070 --> 01:23:00,070
好了 停下
Alright stop!

1071
01:23:00,070 --> 01:23:03,430
Lucius 你這樣你們倆都得死
Lucius, you will kill this man and yourself,

1072
01:23:03,430 --> 01:23:05,970
也阻止不了他什麼
and you'll barely slow them down.

1073
01:23:31,300 --> 01:23:35,110
快點啊 該你上場了
Go on then, do your work!

1074
01:23:37,310 --> 01:23:39,430
帶他們到地面上去
Take them up to the surface!

1075
01:23:39,430 --> 01:23:43,590
他們這種地位的人有權體驗
People of their status deserve to experience

1076
01:23:43,600 --> 01:23:47,210
西方文明的新時代
the next era of Western civilization.

1077
01:23:50,820 --> 01:23:52,950
我掌握了一部分
I had half of daggett some of that plan some odd

1078
01:23:52,950 --> 01:23:55,160
Daggett地下工程中的可疑地點
location they pour for underground construction.

1079
01:23:55,160 --> 01:23:57,120
有蹊蹺嗎
anything strange about the pouring?

1080
01:23:57,120 --> 01:23:58,620
說實話 局長
Honestly, Commissioner.

1081
01:23:58,620 --> 01:24:01,620
我對土木工程不太瞭解
I don't know anything about civil engineering.

1082
01:24:01,620 --> 01:24:05,070
但你瞭解犯罪 繼續找
But knowing about patterns. Keep looking!

1083
01:24:09,740 --> 01:24:14,910
好了 現在這是個四百萬噸級的核彈了
It's done. This is now a 4 megatons nuclear bomb!

1084
01:24:16,440 --> 01:24:20,310
把核心從反應堆裡取出來
Pull the core out of the reactor!

1085
01:24:20,310 --> 01:24:22,880
不 你不能那麼做
No! You cannot!

1086
01:24:22,880 --> 01:24:27,010
這是維持它穩定的能量源
This is the power source capable of sustaining it.

1087
01:24:27,010 --> 01:24:31,290
如果你把它拿走 核心在幾個月內就會衰竭
If you move it, the core will depleted in a matter of months.

1088
01:24:31,290 --> 01:24:35,480
- 按我的計算 是五個月 - 它會爆炸的
- Five, by my calculations. - It will go off!

1089
01:24:36,970 --> 01:24:43,340
為了你孩子著想 帕維爾博士 我希望它真的會爆炸
And for the sake of your children Dr. Pavel, I did hope it does.

1090
01:24:43,370 --> 01:24:46,420
嘿
Hey

1091

就是一半的警察都試圖開進Castle街 
When half the city cops try to pull onto castle street

1094
01:24:56,570 --> 01:24:58,260
而你的卡車把他們堵在外面的那天
and your truck was shutting them out.

1095
01:24:58,260 --> 01:25:01,960
- 哦是啊 你是那個警察 - 現在是警探了
- Oh yeah ... you're the cop. - Detective now

1096
01:25:01,960 --> 01:25:06,240
而作為警探 我不相信巧合
And, as detective we're not allowed to believe in coincidences.

1097
01:25:16,110 --> 01:25:18,870
你們在這裡做什麼 你們有什麼計劃
What were you doing here? What are you working on?

1098

1100
01:25:31,200 --> 01:25:32,340
務必給我回電話

等等 四桶聚異丁烯

1102
01:25:38,380 --> 01:25:41,250
旁邊好像是機油 天啊
That looks like motor oil right next to it. Jesus!

1103
01:25:41,260 --> 01:25:45,280
他們造的不是水泥 是炸彈
They're not making cement, they're making explosive!

1104
01:25:51,770 --> 01:25:54,710
- 給我接通Foley - Foley正在監察行動
- Patch me through Foley! - Foley is overseeing the operation.

1105

他們正往火坑裡跳
They're heading into a trap.

我們看見上千名警察走進下水道

1107
01:25:59,550 --> 01:26:01,790
市長先生 上千名警察正
Mr. Mayor, literally thousands of police ...

1108
01:26:01,800 --> 01:26:03,810
這只是一次演練而已
It's just a training exercise that's all.

1109
01:26:03,940 --> 01:26:05,080
現在 若你不介意
Now, if you'll excuse me,

1110
01:26:05,080 --> 01:26:07,450
我還要拿著這兩張票去看我們的隊員完爆Rapid City隊呢
I got tickets to watch our boys trash Rapid City.

1111

01:26:31,930 --> 01:26:33,610
環繞了整個地下隧道
There's a ring surrounding the tunnels!

1116
01:26:33,610 --> 01:26:36,010
他們會引爆炸藥 把警察全困在地下
They're going to blow it and trap the cops underground!

1117
01:26:36,820 --> 01:26:39,390
全部撤退 馬上
Pull them out! Now!

1118
01:27:03,190 --> 01:27:05,760
這聲音真好聽
That's a lovely lovely voice!

1119
01:27:46,300 --> 01:27:48,810
遊戲開始吧

讓市民們掌控
Citizens take control ...

城裡所有警察都在隧道裡

1124
01:29:43,120 --> 01:29:44,210
不是所有警察

1125
01:29:58,300 --> 01:30:00,300
先生 你還好嗎 我是警察
Sir, you're okay? I'm a police officer,

1127
01:30:51,970 --> 01:30:54,220
開道吧 菜鳥
Play the corners, rookie!

1128
01:30:55,830 --> 01:30:57,920
去拿大衣 孩子

1129
01:30:57,920 --> 01:31:03,510
這 這是奏響自由的號角

1130
01:31:05,560 --> 01:31:08,700
衛星顯示放射性波動
Satellite show some radiation spike.

1131
01:31:08,700 --> 01:31:11,880
不管它是什麼 肯定是核能
Whatever it is, it's nuclear.

1132
01:31:15,710 --> 01:31:19,300
做個自我介紹吧
Identify yourself to the world!

1133
01:31:20,220 --> 01:31:25,920
Leonid Pavel博士 核物理學家
Dr Leonid Pavel, nuclear physicist.

1134
01:31:25,920 --> 01:31:31,390
Pavel已被確認死亡 在烏茲別克斯坦的墜機事件裡
Pavel was confirmed dead, plane crash on an agency pull out of Uzbekistan

1135
01:31:31,390 --> 01:31:34,470
但這看上去是他
 but it looks like it's him.

1136
01:31:34,470 --> 01:31:37,130
那麼這個 這個又是什麼
And what, What is this?

1137
01:31:37,130 --> 01:31:43,950
這是個威力極大的中子彈 輻射半徑6英里
It's a fully prime neutron bomb with a blast radius of 6 miles.

1138
01:31:43,950 --> 01:31:48,380
那麼誰能解除這個裝置呢
And who is capable of disarming such a device?

1139
01:31:49,590 --> 01:31:51,350
只有我

現在 炸彈已經設定好了

這枚炸彈是可操縱的

1143
01:32:06,220 --> 01:32:10,940
而控制它的人的身份是個謎
the identity of the trigger man is a mystery.

1144
01:32:10,940 --> 01:32:16,010
引爆器就在你們當中的一個人手裡
For one of you holds the detonator.

1145
01:32:16,010 --> 01:32:21,300
現在 我們來這裡不是要征服 而是要解放
Now we came here not as conquerors, but liberators to

1146
01:32:21,300 --> 01:32:25,580
我們要把城市的控制權還給市民
return control of this city to the people.

1147
01:32:25,900 --> 01:32:31,190
只要一發現有外界干預
At the first sight of interference of the outside world,

1148
01:32:31,190 --> 01:32:35,740
或是有人試圖逃跑

1149
01:32:36,980 --> 01:32:40,290
這位匿名的哥譚市民
This anonymous Gotham-might,

1150
01:32:40,290 --> 01:32:45,960
這位沉默的英雄就會引爆炸彈
this unsung hero will trigger the bomb.

1151
01:32:46,520 --> 01:32:50,500
從現在開始 戒嚴管制生效
As of now, Martial Law is in effect.

1152
01:32:50,500 --> 01:32:53,220
回家吧
Return to your homes,

1153
01:32:53,220 --> 01:32:58,710
和你們的家人擁抱在一起等待
hold your families close and wait.

1154
01:32:58,710 --> 01:33:03,830
明天你們就知道什麼才真正屬於你
Tomorrow you claim what is rightfully yours.

1155
01:33:08,210 --> 01:33:13,410
撤回戰鬥機 派遣高級別偵察機
Hold back the fighters! Start high level reconnaissance flights.

1156
01:33:13,710 --> 01:33:16,340
給我連線總統
Get the president on the line!

1157
01:33:36,460 --> 01:33:41,660
坦克和飛機不能阻止我們引爆炸彈
Tanks and planes cannot stop us from detonating our device.

1158
01:33:41,660 --> 01:33:47,120
派個談判專家來商議支援與交流的條件
Send a negotiator to discuss term of access to supplies and communication!

1159
01:33:51,820 --> 01:33:54,210
你們有多少人 孩子
How many of you there, son?

1160
01:33:55,550 --> 01:33:59,630
你沒有足夠的人來阻止一千兩百萬人離開這所島嶼
You don't have enough man to stop 12 million people from leaving this island.

1161
01:34:00,530 --> 01:34:05,150
是的 我們沒有 但你們有
No, no we don't. But you do.

1162
01:34:05,280 --> 01:34:09,630
為什麼我們要幫你囚禁你的人質
Why the hell would I try help you to keep your hostages?

1163
01:34:09,630 --> 01:34:14,800
要是有一個人跨過這座橋 哥譚就會被炸飛
If one person crosses this bridge, Gotham gets blown to hell.

1164
01:34:20,220 --> 01:34:23,070
我們最偉大城市的居民是堅韌的
The people of our greatest city are resilient

1165
01:34:23,340 --> 01:34:28,150
他們證明過一次 也會證明第二次
They have proven this before and they will prove it again.

1166
01:34:29,790 --> 01:34:33,320
我們不和恐怖分子談判
We do not negotiate with terrorists,

1167
01:34:33,320 --> 01:34:35,510
但我們能認清事實
But we do recognize realities.

1168
01:34:35,510 --> 01:34:38,130
隨著情況不斷發展
As this situation develops,

1169
01:34:38,130 --> 01:34:42,600
有一件事必須明確
one thing must be understood above all others.

1170
01:34:43,100 --> 01:34:47,740
哥譚人民 我們沒有拋棄你們
People of Gotham, we have not abandoned you.

1171
01:34:47,740 --> 01:34:48,540
這是什麼意思
What does that mean?

1172
01:34:48,540 --> 01:34:51,410
意思就是我們得靠自己了
It means we're on our own.

1173
01:34:51,410 --> 01:34:54,270
我得去找媒體
I have to get in front of a camera.

1174
01:34:54,270 --> 01:34:56,750
可是長官 你一露面他們就會把你殺了
Well sir, they will kill you the second you show your face.

1175
01:34:56,750 --> 01:35:00,310
Bane說他要把哥譚還給市民
Bane says he's giving Gotham back to the people.

1176
01:35:00,310 --> 01:35:02,000
他們得知道我能引領他們
They need to know I could lead.

1177
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:03,380
Bane不會讓這發生的
Bane is not going to let that happen.

1178
01:35:03,380 --> 01:35:05,940
- 那麼他就會露出本來面目 - 那你就死了
- Then he will show his true colors - Then you'd be dead.

1179
01:35:24,320 --> 01:35:29,890
在你們身後 正是壓迫的象徵
Behind you, stand a symbol of oppression.

1180

Harvey Dent

1182
01:35:42,370 --> 01:35:50,330
他作為正義的閃亮標誌被呈現在你們面前
Who has been held to you as the shinning example of justice.

1183
01:35:50,330 --> 01:35:52,870
在你面對媒體之前我們的行動不能停下
We're just keep moving you until we can get you in front of a camera.

1184
01:35:52,870 --> 01:35:55,950
你們供奉著一個虛假的偶像
You have been supplied with a false idol,

1185
01:35:55,950 --> 01:36:01,040
為了讓你們不把這個墮落的城市撕成碎片

1186
01:36:01,040 --> 01:36:04,690
讓我告訴你Harvey Dent的真相吧
Let me tell you the truth about Harvey Dent!

1187
01:36:04,690 --> 01:36:09,430
這是哥譚警察局長的發言稿
From the prayers of Gotham Police Commissioner.

1188
01:36:10,950 --> 01:36:12,390
James Gordon
James Gordon.

1189
01:36:12,390 --> 01:36:19,080
蝙蝠俠沒有謀害Harvey Dent 他救了我的兒子
The Batman didn't murdered Harvey Dent, he saved my boy.

1190

卻為Harvey Dent的駭人罪行背了黑鍋
Then took the blame for Harvey's appalling crimes,

1191
01:36:23,790 --> 01:36:25,820
我才可以毫無羞恥地
So that I could threw my shame,

1192
01:36:25,830 --> 01:36:32,820
為這個墮落的偶像編造謊言
build a lie around this fallen idol.

1193
01:36:34,260 --> 01:36:40,620
我歌頌一個試圖殺死我兒子的狂魔
I praised mad man who tried to kill my own child,

1194
01:36:40,620 --> 01:36:43,900
但我再也無法生活在謊言裡了
But I can no longer live with my lie.

1195
01:36:43,900 --> 01:36:48,060
是時候將真相公之於眾了
it's time to trust The people of Gotham with the truth

1196
01:36:48,060 --> 01:36:52,520
同時我也會引咎辭職
And it is time for me to resign.

1197
01:36:52,520 --> 01:36:56,640
那麼 你們接受這個人的辭呈嗎
And do you accept this man resignation?

1198
01:36:58,120 --> 01:37:02,850
你們接受所有這些腐敗者和騙子
And do you accept the resignations of all these liars,

1199
01:37:02,850 --> 01:37:04,660
的辭呈嗎
of all the corrupt?

1200
01:37:07,980 --> 01:37:11,570
那些人被關在黑門監獄長達八年
Those men locked up for 8 years at Blackgate with

1201
01:37:11,570 --> 01:37:15,020
僅僅因為一個建立在謊言上的法案而無法重獲自由
denied parole under the Dent's act based on a lie?

1202
01:37:15,020 --> 01:37:17,580
哥譚需要一個英雄
Gotham needed a hero.

1203
01:37:17,580 --> 01:37:19,460
比過去任何一個時期都更需要
It needs it now more than ever.

1204
01:37:19,460 --> 01:37:21,750
你背叛了自己的立場
You betrayed everything you stood for.

1205
01:37:23,420 --> 01:37:25,390
你以為我想嗎
What's the point?

1206
01:37:27,280 --> 01:37:30,330
那時的法制太無力
Far out there when the structures failing,

1207
01:37:30,330 --> 01:37:33,800
滿街的武器比手銬還多
and on the road, weapons city more than shackles

1208
01:37:33,840 --> 01:37:36,670
四處都是狂躁的犯罪分子
and letting the bad guy getting hit.

1209
01:37:37,900 --> 01:37:43,650
有一天你也可能面對這樣的危機
One day, you may face such a moment of crisis

1210
01:37:43,650 --> 01:37:47,280
在那時 我希望你像我一樣有個這樣的朋友
and in that moment I hope you have a friend like I did!

1211
01:37:47,280 --> 01:37:49,610
願意弄髒自己的聲名
To plunge their hands into the filth

1212
01:37:49,610 --> 01:37:53,470
保你清白
 so that you can keep yours clean.

1213
01:37:53,470 --> 01:37:57,840
我看你的名聲已毀了 局長
Your hands looks pretty filthy to me, Commissioner.

1214
01:37:57,840 --> 01:38:02,720
我們從腐敗者手中奪回哥譚
We take Gotham from the corrupt.

1215
01:38:04,270 --> 01:38:05,840
從富人手中
The rich.

1216
01:38:05,840 --> 01:38:09,220
從那些借神之名世代壓迫
The oppressors who for generation

1217
01:38:09,220 --> 01:38:13,510
你們的人手中
has get you down with myth of opportunity,

1218
01:38:13,510 --> 01:38:18,380
我們把哥譚還給你們 人民們
and we give it back to you, the people.

1219
01:38:19,570 --> 01:38:24,550
哥譚是你們的 無人有權干涉
Gotham is yours. None shall interfered.

1220
01:38:24,550 --> 01:38:26,120
想做什麼就放手去做吧
Do as you pleased.

1221
01:38:26,120 --> 01:38:32,400
以轟開黑門監獄 解放受壓迫者為起點
and start by storming Blackgate and freeing the oppressed!

1222
01:38:40,760 --> 01:38:43,920
願為自由而戰的請上前
Step forward those who would serve.

1223
01:38:45,500 --> 01:38:49,020
新的世界將會崛起
To an army, a world will be raised.

1224
01:38:51,370 --> 01:38:56,890
將權貴從他們多年沉溺的迷夢中揪出
The powerful will be ripped from their decadent years...

1225
01:39:00,170 --> 01:39:06,290
然後丟棄在我們熟知並忍受的冰冷世界
and cast out into the cold world that we know and endure.

1226
01:39:10,650 --> 01:39:14,700
被人民的法庭傳喚審判
Courts will be convened.

1227
01:39:20,340 --> 01:39:24,300
財贓將由我們共享
Spoils will be enjoyed.

1228
01:39:27,620 --> 01:39:30,790
哥譚將被罪惡之血洗滌
Blood will be shed.

1229
01:39:32,650 --> 01:39:35,710
警察會倖存
The Police will survive

1230
01:39:35,810 --> 01:39:40,400
如果他們學會維護真正的正義
as they learn to serve true justice ...

1231
01:39:40,400 --> 01:39:44,290
這座偉大的城
This great city ...

1232
01:39:45,540 --> 01:39:48,870
將隱忍堅持
it will endure ...!

1233
01:39:49,870 --> 01:39:53,940
哥譚會倖存下來
Gotham will survive!

1234
01:40:14,950 --> 01:40:18,160
他說你要先治好你的背
He says you must first fix your back.

1235
01:40:18,160 --> 01:40:19,470
他怎麼知道
How does he know?

1236
01:40:19,470 --> 01:40:22,870
他是監獄的醫生 一個癮君子
He was the prison doctor. A morphine addict.

1237
01:40:22,870 --> 01:40:26,920
對嗎啡不能自拔
When heard of this pleasure of powerful evil,

1238
01:40:26,930 --> 01:40:29,920
你的面具朋友也是
including your mask friend.

1239
01:40:29,930 --> 01:40:31,360
怎麼
How?

1240
01:40:32,510 --> 01:40:37,940
很多年前 瘟疫氾濫的時候
Many years ago, it was a time of plague.

1241
01:40:37,970 --> 01:40:42,620
有些犯人傷了Bane
Some of the other prisoners attacked Bane.

1242
01:40:43,410 --> 01:40:46,610
醫生卻沒有盡力救他
The Doctor humbling attempt to rebuild the damage,

1243
01:40:46,610 --> 01:40:49,800
把Bane永遠留在了痛苦的深淵
left him in perpetual agony.

1244
01:40:49,800 --> 01:40:53,200
只能靠面具鎮住痛苦
The Mask hold the pain at bay.

1245
01:40:53,200 --> 01:40:58,800
貝恩就是那個逃出去的小孩 他生在這裡
Bane was the child who struck out? He was born here?

1246
01:40:58,800 --> 01:41:03,610
傳說曾有一個為當地軍閥效命的僱傭兵
Legend is that it was a mercenary who worked for a local warlord.

1247
01:41:03,620 --> 01:41:06,980
卻與軍閥的女兒墜入愛河
They felt in love with the warlord's daughter.

1248
01:41:06,980 --> 01:41:11,050
他們私定終身 最終被軍閥發現了 
They were married in secret, but the warlord found out.

1249
01:41:11,050 --> 01:41:15,670
軍閥要把僱傭軍關到這個監獄
The mercenary was condemned to this pit.

1250
01:41:15,670 --> 01:41:17,590
但最終他只是被流放
But then he exiled him instead.

1251
01:41:17,590 --> 01:41:19,270
據我所知
The mess I understood that

1252
01:41:19,270 --> 01:41:22,050
是軍閥的女兒為他爭取到了自由
it was the daughter who secure his release.

1253
01:41:22,050 --> 01:41:27,970
但他並不知道 這自由的真正代價
But what he could not know, was the true price of his freedom.

1254
01:41:27,970 --> 01:41:31,720
是那個姑娘代替他坐牢
She took his place in the pit.

1255
01:41:32,960 --> 01:41:37,650
那時她已懷上了僱傭兵的孩子
And she was with child, the mercenary child.

1256
01:41:38,940 --> 01:41:43,880
無辜的花朵無法在地下盛開 等待它的必然是枯萎
Innocence cannot flower underground, it has to be stem out ...

1257
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:51,240
有一天 醫生忘記鎖門
One day, the doctor forgot to lock the cell.

1258
01:41:57,600 --> 01:42:02,610
而那個孩子有一個朋友 一個守護者
But the child had a friend, a protector.

1259
01:42:02,610 --> 01:42:07,010
他試圖說服其他人這個孩子會是他們的救贖
Who showed the others that this innocence was their redemption.

1260
01:42:07,010 --> 01:42:09,010
但這是有代價的
It was to be priced.

1261
01:42:09,010 --> 01:42:10,720
而孩子的母親就沒有那麼幸運了
The mother was not so lucky.

1262
01:42:12,720 --> 01:42:17,510
這裡現在是Bane的監獄了 他不希望我們談論他
This is Bane's prison now. It wouldn't want this story told.

1263
01:42:27,980 --> 01:42:32,030
你背上有一塊脊椎突出來了
There's a vertebra protruding from your back.

1264
01:42:32,030 --> 01:42:34,600
要把它推回去
It has to be put back.

1265
01:42:39,320 --> 01:42:42,960
保持這個狀態直到你能站起來
Stay like this until you stand.

1266
01:42:51,200 --> 01:42:54,510
你沒想過我會回來嗎 Bruce
Did you not think I would return, Bruce?

1267
01:43:00,520 --> 01:43:03,270
我告訴過你我是不死之身
I told you I was immortal.

1268
01:43:04,770 --> 01:43:08,010
我親眼看著你死的
I watched you die!

1269
01:43:08,010 --> 01:43:10,970
哦 但是永生的形式有很多種
Oh they're many forms of immortality.

1270
01:43:11,950 --> 01:43:17,000
我曾經有一個妻子 我的至愛
Once I had a wife. My great love.

1271
01:43:17,900 --> 01:43:21,230
她被從我身邊奪走
She was taken from me.

1272
01:43:21,230 --> 01:43:23,310
你就是那個僱傭兵
You were the mercenary.

1273
01:43:25,270 --> 01:43:31,060
Bane是你的兒子 你的繼承人 
Bane is your child, your heir.

1274
01:43:31,060 --> 01:43:32,950
我在這裡是確保影武者聯盟
I'm here to ensure The League of Shadow

1275
01:43:32,950 --> 01:43:36,850
完成其重建文明平衡的使命
fulfills it's duty to restore balance to civilization.

1276
01:43:36,890 --> 01:43:40,680
你為腐朽的哥譚市孤身奮鬥多年
You yourself fought the decadence of Gotham for years

1277
01:43:40,680 --> 01:43:45,020
用你的力量 你的資源
with all your strength, all your resources,

1278
01:43:45,020 --> 01:43:47,680
以及你的道德聲望
all your moral authority.

1279
01:43:47,850 --> 01:43:51,720
然而你唯一的成就卻是一個謊言
and the only victory you achieved was a lie.

1280
01:43:51,720 --> 01:43:55,750
現在 你明白了嗎 哥譚已無藥可救
Now, you understand? Gotham is beyond saving

1281
01:43:55,750 --> 01:43:57,840
它必須得死去
and must be allowed to die.

1282
01:44:14,650 --> 01:44:15,960
不
No!

1283
01:44:51,940 --> 01:44:54,170
-這是哪  -這曾是某人的家
- What's that? - This was someone's home.

1284
01:44:54,170 --> 01:44:57,590
現在是所有人的家了
Now, it's everyone's home.

1285
01:44:57,590 --> 01:45:01,780
風暴就要來了 記得嗎 正是我們期待的
There's storm coming remember? That is what we wanted.

1286
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:32,850
這是給車上準備的 以防有撤離的機會
It's for the bus, in case there's a chance to evacuate.

1287
01:45:33,250 --> 01:45:36,610
-有局長的消息嗎 -你還是不知道的好 神父
- Any news from the Commissioner? - The less you know father..

1288
01:45:36,640 --> 01:45:38,200
孩子們現在怎麼樣
How are the boys doing?

1289
01:45:38,230 --> 01:45:41,590
恢復了一些電力 孩子們可以看電視了
Well we had more power on, so they get some TV.

1290
01:45:41,590 --> 01:45:45,100
-很高興看到你 神父 -Blake 你在外面小心一點
- It's good to see you father. - Blake, you be careful out there.

1291
01:45:45,100 --> 01:45:48,060
他們像惡犬一樣追殺警察
They hunting down cops like dogs.

1292
01:45:52,970 --> 01:45:58,180
-鍛煉有什麼意義呢 -我不該死在這裡
- Why build yourself? - I'm not meant to die in here.

1293
01:45:58,210 --> 01:46:02,990
這裡 那裡 又有什麼分別
Here or there, what's the difference?

1294
01:47:03,400 --> 01:47:06,820
我說過 不可能逃出升天的
I told you it can not be done.

1295
01:47:06,820 --> 01:47:09,670
你說過 有個孩子做到了
You told me a child did it.

1296
01:47:09,670 --> 01:47:15,840
可那不是一般的孩子 他生於地獄
But no ordinary child, a child born in hell,

1297
01:47:19,550 --> 01:47:22,070
長於苦難
forged from suffering,

1298
01:47:23,050 --> 01:47:26,340
痛苦讓他堅強
harden by pain.

1299
01:47:26,340 --> 01:47:30,560
不是你這樣的富家少爺
Not a man from privileged.

1300
01:47:48,280 --> 01:47:50,550
我們派人進去了
We got blues in the ground sir.

1301
01:47:50,850 --> 01:47:53,410
等消息吧
Just waiting on intel.

1302
01:47:58,140 --> 01:48:01,020
-有身份證明嗎 -當然沒有
- Do you have ID? - Of course not.

1303
01:48:01,020 --> 01:48:04,630
-那我們怎麼相信你 -我們別無選擇
- How can we trust you? - We don't have any choice.

1304
01:48:04,630 --> 01:48:06,940
Gorden局長 我是Jones上尉 特種部隊
Commissioner Gordon. Captain Jones, Special Forces.

1305
01:48:06,940 --> 01:48:09,900
-上尉 幸會 -職責所在
- Captain, glad to have you here. - It's our job sir.

1306
01:48:09,900 --> 01:48:11,940
現在你們有多少人
Now how many are all you are they?

1307
01:48:11,940 --> 01:48:14,610
幾十個吧 還是不說為好
Well there's dozen, I rather not say exactly.

1308
01:48:14,620 --> 01:48:17,920
但我們有近三千警察被困地下
The man trapped underground, numbered almost 3,000.

1309
01:48:17,920 --> 01:48:18,930
他們現在是什麼情況
What kind of condition are they in?

1310
01:48:18,940 --> 01:48:19,980
有水和食物
They been getting in food and water.

1311
01:48:19,980 --> 01:48:21,820
-我們能把他們救出來嗎 -可以 長官
- Can we break them out? - Yes, sir.

1312
01:48:21,820 --> 01:48:22,950
把守在Ackerman公園南部的
Take out the mercenaries

1313
01:48:22,950 --> 01:48:25,060
僱傭兵幹掉
guarding the outflows south of Ackerman Park,

1314
01:48:25,060 --> 01:48:27,970
炸開碎石 就能弄出一個一次夠十個人通行的洞
blow the rubble, we can make a hole big enough for 10 at a time.

1315
01:48:27,970 --> 01:48:29,850
我一直和我地下的搭檔保持著聯繫
I'm in contact with my partner down there.

1316
01:48:29,850 --> 01:48:31,340
他們等這一天等很久了
They're just waiting for the day.

1317
01:48:31,340 --> 01:48:33,040
指揮官 他們已經3個月沒有見過陽光了
Commander, they haven't seen daylight for three months.

1318
01:48:33,040 --> 01:48:35,600
他們是訓練有素的警察 這些對他們不是問題
Police officers who haven't seen daylight in three months.

1319
01:48:35,600 --> 01:48:36,500
那個核彈呢
What about the bomb?

1320
01:48:36,500 --> 01:48:38,920
衛星偵測不到任何紅外線熱點
The satellite can't pick up any radiation hot spots.

1321
01:48:38,920 --> 01:48:42,440
他們把核彈放在卡車上 一定是鉛頂的
They keep it on a truck. It must have lead lined roof.

1322
01:48:42,450 --> 01:48:45,410
-卡車不曾停過 -很好 那你知道是哪輛車嗎
- They're moving constantly. - Good, so you know the truck?

1323
01:48:45,410 --> 01:48:48,860
肯定是三輛中的一輛 我們已經在追蹤它們了
Well it's one of the three. We've been tracking it.

1324
01:48:49,190 --> 01:48:50,680
這個不是
Decoy.

1325
01:48:51,700 --> 01:48:53,670
你不會真的相信他會回來 是吧
You're not really think he's coming back, do you?

1326
01:48:53,670 --> 01:48:54,810
我怎麼想的並不重要
Doesn't matter what I think.

1327
01:48:54,810 --> 01:48:56,150
事實上很重要
Actually it does.

1328
01:48:56,150 --> 01:48:59,030
你應該把你的信念建立在更實際的事物之上
You should put your faith in something more real.

1329
01:48:59,030 --> 01:49:01,270
路線沒有更改過
But the routes don't vary much.

1330
01:49:01,280 --> 01:49:04,710
-那個引爆者呢 -沒有線索 應該是假的
- What about the trigger man? - No leads. It's a bluff.

1331
01:49:04,710 --> 01:49:07,270
Bane不會把引爆器的控制權假手於人的
Bane wouldn't gave control on that to someone else.

1332
01:49:07,270 --> 01:49:08,600
我們不能冒這個險
We can't take that chance.

1333
01:49:08,630 --> 01:49:11,190
在找到引爆者前 得繼續追蹤卡車
Until we have the trigger man, we just track the device.

1334
01:49:11,200 --> 01:49:13,990
同時就讓哥譚處於軍閥管控下嗎
And mean while, Gotham lives under a warlord?

1335
01:49:13,990 --> 01:49:15,370
就像某些淪陷的國家
Like some failed state?

1336
01:49:15,370 --> 01:49:18,380
意見駁回 警官 這形勢是前所未見的
Dialed it back, officer. The situation is unprecedented.

1337
01:49:18,380 --> 01:49:20,440
我們不能拿數百萬的生命來冒險
We can't do anything to risk million of lives.

1338
01:49:20,440 --> 01:49:21,680
你不打算說明嗎
Can't you tell? Aren't you

1339
01:49:21,680 --> 01:49:23,830
你不打算告訴他們到底發生了什麼嗎
going to tell them what actually is going on?

1340
01:49:23,830 --> 01:49:27,350
情況要遠比你想像的複雜 上尉
Captain, the situation is more complicated than you think.

1341
01:49:27,350 --> 01:49:29,430
有個人 你得見一見
There's someone you need to meet.

1342
01:49:29,440 --> 01:49:31,870
我曾上樓尋找戰鬥制高點
Came up stairs looking for a vantage point.

1343
01:49:31,870 --> 01:49:34,260
發現公司的高層住在這上面
Found the people who runs the corporation living up here.

1344
01:49:34,260 --> 01:49:35,010
什麼公司
What corporation?

1345
01:49:35,010 --> 01:49:36,940
韋恩集團
Wayne Enterprises.

1346
01:49:46,610 --> 01:49:48,810
Fox先生 你能向上尉簡單介紹一下嗎
Mr. Fox would you like to brief the captain?

1347
01:49:48,810 --> 01:49:51,600
Tate小姐 對情況非常瞭解
Mrs. Tate is fully aware of the situation.

1348
01:49:51,600 --> 01:49:53,710
作為韋恩集團的首席執行官
As the CEO of Wayne Enterprises,

1349
01:49:53,710 --> 01:49:56,140
我必須對此負責
I have to take responsibility for it.

1350
01:49:56,140 --> 01:49:58,370
-為什麼 -因為我們創造了它
- Why? - We built it.

1351
01:49:58,370 --> 01:49:59,880
你們做了這個核彈
You built the bomb?

1352
01:49:59,880 --> 01:50:04,260
最初是以供能反應堆來建造的 是好事
It was build as a fussion reactor. First of it's kind

1353
01:50:04,290 --> 01:50:07,930
Bane把它變成了核彈 並帶出了反應堆
Bane turned the core into a bomb, and remove it from the reactor.

1354
01:50:07,940 --> 01:50:09,150
這是最重要的部分
That's the important part.

1355
01:50:09,150 --> 01:50:11,550
隨著設備的能源單元衰變
As the device's fuel cells deteriorates,

1356
01:50:11,550 --> 01:50:15,340
它逐漸變得不穩定 最終爆炸
it becomes increasingly unstable to the point of detonation.

1357
01:50:15,340 --> 01:50:19,540
-這是個定時核彈 -而且23天後就會爆炸
- This bomb is a time bomb. - And it will go off in 23 days.

1358
01:50:19,540 --> 01:50:22,230
不管Bane的革命如何進行
Regardless of the Bane's revolution or what we

1359
01:50:22,230 --> 01:50:24,350
不管我們和外界如何行動
and the outside world choose to do.

1360
01:50:24,350 --> 01:50:27,300
你的不冒險計劃不像你想得那麼可操作
Your peace-man plan may not be as practical as you thought.

1361
01:50:27,310 --> 01:50:28,430
你能拆除它嗎
Could you disarm it?

1362
01:50:28,480 --> 01:50:31,680
我可以把它重新插入反應堆使之穩定
I could reconnect to the reactor to stabilize it.

1363
01:50:31,680 --> 01:50:33,960
我們撤 行動吧
Let's move away from this location and call it in.

1364
01:50:33,960 --> 01:50:34,770
好 我們走
Alright let's go!

1365
01:50:34,770 --> 01:50:38,390
現在我來負責 你們留下照顧他們 
Let me take it from here. You stay and look after these folks.

1366
01:50:45,400 --> 01:50:47,200
有人出賣了我們
Someone sold us out.

1367
01:51:11,200 --> 01:51:13,770
我死也不說
I'd die before I talk.

1368
01:51:13,770 --> 01:51:17,670
那你就去死吧 上尉
How about new schedule, Captain.

1369
01:51:22,980 --> 01:51:25,720
樓上有人居住
There were people living upstairs.

1370
01:51:25,720 --> 01:51:27,930
把他們抓起來送去審判
Round them up for judgment.

1371
01:51:31,740 --> 01:51:36,680
然後把他們的屍體懸掛展示給世人
And hang them where the world to see.

1372
01:51:51,360 --> 01:51:55,860
他說 那逃脫的一躍靠的不是身體力量
He says that the leap of freedom is not about strength.

1373
01:51:55,860 --> 01:52:00,270
-但是我要用我的身體來完成跳躍 -是想要倖存的信念
- My body makes the jump. - Surviving is spirit

1374
01:52:00,270 --> 01:52:01,980
是靈魂
the soul

1375
01:52:04,960 --> 01:52:08,130
我的靈魂已經準備好了和身體一起逃離
My soul, it is ready to escape with my body

1376
01:52:08,130 --> 01:52:11,100
你恐懼的是恐懼本身嗎
Fear is what you afraid?

1377
01:52:11,100 --> 01:52:13,620
不 我不恐懼
No, I'm not afraid.

1378
01:52:14,590 --> 01:52:16,770
我憤怒
I'm angry.

1379
01:52:44,850 --> 01:52:46,190
Bruce
Bruce ...

1380
01:52:47,920 --> 01:52:50,210
我們為什麼會墜落
Why did we fall?

1381
01:52:55,220 --> 01:52:57,720
你不恐懼死亡
You do not fear death.

1382
01:52:57,720 --> 01:53:02,220
你認為這使你強大  其實它使你變的軟弱
You think this makes you strong? It makes you weak.

1383
01:53:03,180 --> 01:53:04,570
為什麼
Why?

1384
01:53:04,570 --> 01:53:07,090
一個人如何能有超常人的行動力
How can you move faster than possible?

1385
01:53:07,090 --> 01:53:09,600
超常人的戰鬥力
Fight longer than possible?

1386
01:53:09,600 --> 01:53:13,970
而心中卻沒有最強大的驅動力
Without the most powerful impulse left in you.

1387
01:53:13,970 --> 01:53:16,820
對死亡的恐懼
The fear of death.

1388
01:53:16,820 --> 01:53:19,930
我恐懼死亡
I fear death.

1389
01:53:19,930 --> 01:53:25,000
我恐懼我就在這裡死去 而我的城市卻在水深火熱
I fear dying in here, all my city burns,

1390
01:53:25,010 --> 01:53:28,680
沒人可以拯救
there's no one there to save it.

1391
01:53:29,550 --> 01:53:32,140
那就從這裡爬出去
And then make the climb!

1392
01:53:36,350 --> 01:53:38,050
怎麼爬
How?

1393
01:53:38,880 --> 01:53:41,770
就像那個孩子一樣
As the child did.

1394
01:53:45,220 --> 01:53:49,190
不用繩子
Without the rope.

1395
01:53:49,190 --> 01:53:53,080
直面你的恐懼
That fear will fight you again.

1396
01:53:58,780 --> 01:54:03,190
啊 你竟然還沒放棄 很好啊
Ah surprise for your journey, that's wonderful.

1397
01:54:08,220 --> 01:54:11,720
- 他們在喊什麼 - 崛起
- What does that mean? - Rise.

1398
01:54:12,850 --> 01:54:14,320
不需要
No.

1399
01:55:44,020 --> 01:55:48,070
你們搞錯了 帶我去見Bane
There's been a mistake. Take me to Bane!

1400
01:55:50,430 --> 01:55:52,350
Bane在哪兒
Where's Bane?

1401
01:55:58,140 --> 01:55:59,410
Bane在哪兒
Where's Bane?

1402
01:55:59,410 --> 01:56:04,230
沒搞錯 Stryver先生 Philip Stryver
There's no mistake Mr. Stryver. You are Philip Stryver.

1403
01:56:04,230 --> 01:56:08,130
Daggett公司的執行副總裁
Executive Vice President of Daggett Industries?

1404
01:56:08,140 --> 01:56:11,100
多年來壓搾弱者血汗
Who for years has been living off the blood

1405
01:56:11,110 --> 01:56:14,140
供自己享樂的傢伙
and sweat of people less powerful than him!

1406
01:56:14,140 --> 01:56:17,720
叫Bane來 我是自己人
Call Bane! I am one of you.

1407
01:56:17,720 --> 01:56:21,770
Bane不管這事兒 這不過是個量刑聽證會
Bane has no authority here. This is merely a sentencing hearing.

1408
01:56:21,770 --> 01:56:26,470
你選吧 流放還是死刑
Now chooses are yours: exile or death?

1409
01:56:32,710 --> 01:56:36,000
- 流放 - 成交
- Exile. - Sold!

1410
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:38,750
先生別太緊張嘛
The man of the cold sweat.

1411
01:56:45,460 --> 01:56:46,970
沿著厚冰走
You follow the thick ice.

1412
01:56:46,970 --> 01:56:49,580
想遊走的 即刻槍決
If you try to swim, you're dead in minutes.

1413
01:56:49,580 --> 01:56:51,380
沒人活下來麼
So no one made it?

1414
01:57:04,800 --> 01:57:05,740
他們都死到哪兒去了
Where the hell are they?

1415
01:57:05,750 --> 01:57:07,440
我們時間緊迫
It's not like we have a lot of time here.

1416
01:57:07,440 --> 01:57:10,470
- 還有多久 - 核彈明天就要爆了
- How long? - The bomb goes off tomorrow.

1417
01:57:10,470 --> 01:57:12,790
我們還有18個小時補救
We have about 18 hours to do something.

1418
01:57:12,790 --> 01:57:13,490
怎麼補救
To do what?

1419
01:57:13,490 --> 01:57:15,360
給卡車作標記 裝個GPS上去
To mark the truck. Get a GPS on it,

1420
01:57:15,360 --> 01:57:18,060
然後我們才能想辦法逐個擊破
so we can start to figure out how to bring it down.

1421
01:57:24,580 --> 01:57:26,270
就這些?
That's it?

1422
01:57:28,370 --> 01:57:30,490
Foley
Foley!

1423
01:57:30,980 --> 01:57:33,680
Foley哪兒去了 他媽的
Where is Foley? Damn it!

1424
01:57:33,680 --> 01:57:35,260
你不能上街的
You shouldn't be out in the streets.

1425
01:57:39,730 --> 01:57:40,780
Jim 他不在家
Jim, he's not here.

1426
01:57:40,790 --> 01:57:43,340
城市陷入魔掌
You let your wife come to the door,

1427
01:57:43,340 --> 01:57:45,820
你卻躲在妻子身後
when the city is under occupation?

1428
01:57:45,850 --> 01:57:49,210
你怎麼了 把制服埋在後院了麼
What did you do? Bury your uniform in the backyard?

1429
01:57:49,210 --> 01:57:51,360
你也看到他們把特警部隊怎麼了
You saw what they did to the special forces.

1430
01:57:51,360 --> 01:57:53,610
你忘了我們當差巡邏的日子了嗎
Have you forgotten all the years we were out on patrolled?

1431
01:57:53,610 --> 01:57:54,670
當年那些匪徒們
When every gang banger want

1432
01:57:54,670 --> 01:57:56,400
我們稍一調頭就想給我們吃槍子
to plant one as soon as our back are turned?

1433
01:57:56,400 --> 01:57:58,920
今時不同往日你比誰都清楚 哥譚市任人魚肉
Now is different and you know it. This guys run the city.

1434
01:57:58,920 --> 01:58:00,780
政府和他們訂了協議
The government is done a deal with them.

1435
01:58:00,780 --> 01:58:03,730
是Bane威逼他們 那不算協議
Bane's got their balls on the ice that's not a deal.

1436
01:58:03,730 --> 01:58:06,930
如果你對Bane下手 那個引爆者就會引爆核彈的
If you move on Bane, the trigger-man is going to hit the button.

1437
01:58:06,930 --> 01:58:08,480
你真以為他會把核彈引爆器
Do you think he's given

1438
01:58:08,480 --> 01:58:11,300
交給某一個市民嗎
control of that bomb to one of the people?

1439
01:58:11,300 --> 01:58:13,910
你覺得他們在鬧革命嗎
You think this apart of some revolutions?

1440
01:58:13,910 --> 01:58:16,520
引爆器只由一人掌控 那就是Bane
There's only one man with his finger on the button, that's Bane.

1441
01:58:16,520 --> 01:58:19,700
聽著 在恐慌結束前 還是不要輕舉妄動的好
Look we all got to keep our heads down until they can fix this.

1442
01:58:19,700 --> 01:58:20,930
如果你也有家庭
If you had family here ...

1443
01:58:20,930 --> 01:58:25,170
哥譚只能靠我們自己拯救
It's only get fix from inside the city.

1444
01:58:25,330 --> 01:58:29,350
聽著 Peter 我不是要你
Look Peter, I'm not asking you

1445
01:58:29,350 --> 01:58:31,520
穿著制服上街抓賊
to walk down grand in you dress rules,

1446
01:58:31,520 --> 01:58:32,620
但有些事必須做
but something has to be done.

1447
01:58:32,720 --> 01:58:34,810
- 對不起 Jim 我不能 - 你給我清醒點
- I'm sorry, Jim. I gotta... - Keep your head down..

1448
01:58:34,810 --> 01:58:37,650
那玩意兒明天就爆了 你又能怎樣呢
What's good that going to do tomorrow when that thing blows.

1449
01:58:37,650 --> 01:58:40,530
又不是你說了算
You don't know that's going to happens.

1450
01:58:44,070 --> 01:58:46,610
聽說你缺人手 警長
I hear you're looking for men Commissioner?

1451
01:58:46,610 --> 01:58:47,880
我行麼
How about me instead?

1452
01:58:47,890 --> 01:58:53,060
- Tate小姐 這太危險了 - 拜託了
- Miss Tate, I can't ask you to do that. - Please.

1453
01:58:55,720 --> 01:58:57,720
- 你偷什麼了 - 沒什麼
- What you did? - Nothing.

1454
01:58:57,750 --> 01:58:59,080
我什麼都沒偷
I didn't take anything.

1455
01:58:59,080 --> 01:59:01,840
敢偷我們的東西 你這小兔崽子
You steal from us? You little bastard.

1456
01:59:03,170 --> 01:59:05,170
現在你們知道
Now you boys know you can't come in my

1457
01:59:05,170 --> 01:59:07,170
別在我的地盤撒野了吧
neighborhood without asking politely.

1458
01:59:12,660 --> 01:59:16,890
不要從能追上你的人手裡偷東西 孩子
Never steal anything from someone you can't outrun, kid!

1459
01:59:22,200 --> 01:59:25,910
你個小賊 還挺大方的
You're pretty generous for a thief!

1460
01:59:33,220 --> 01:59:36,190
- 還以為你死了呢 - 還沒呢
- I thought they killed you. - Not yet.

1461
01:59:36,190 --> 01:59:40,620
- 如果你在等我道歉的話 - 我知道你不會
- If you expecting an apology ... - It wouldn't suit you.

1462
01:59:40,620 --> 01:59:42,220
我需要你的幫助
I need your help.

1463
01:59:42,220 --> 01:59:46,300
- 為什麼我要幫你 - 為了 "清洗程序"
- And why would I help you? - For this. ' Clean Slate '.

1464
01:59:46,300 --> 01:59:50,750
我把你害成那樣 你還信我
You trust me with that, after what I did to you?

1465
01:59:50,750 --> 01:59:53,820
我得承認我有些失望
I admit I was a little let down.

1466
01:59:55,180 --> 01:59:57,050
但我依然相信你心裡更好的一面
But I still think there more to you.

1467
01:59:57,050 --> 02:00:00,140
事實上 我認為 對你來說 這不只是個工具
In fact that, I think that. For you, this isn't just a tool.

1468
02:00:00,140 --> 02:00:04,360
你想借此消失 重新開始
It's an escape route you want to disappear, start fresh.

1469
02:00:04,360 --> 02:00:06,180
我連這個島都出不了
I couldn't even get off this island.

1470
02:00:06,190 --> 02:00:09,190
帶我去找Lucius Fox 我能幫你找到一條路
I could give you a way off once you to get me to Lucius Fox.

1471
02:00:09,190 --> 02:00:13,160
我要你查出他關在哪兒 帶我去
I need you to find out where they're holding him and take me in.

1472
02:00:15,700 --> 02:00:18,170
- 為什麼找Fox - 為了拯救這座城
- Why do you need Fox? - To save the city.

1473
02:00:18,170 --> 02:00:21,540
誰說哥譚需要被拯救 我挺喜歡這樣的
Who says it needs saving? Maybe I like it this way.

1474
02:00:21,540 --> 02:00:24,220
你喜歡而已
Maybe you do.

1475
02:00:24,220 --> 02:00:27,630
但核彈明天就要爆了
But tomorrow that bomb is going off.

1476
02:00:29,230 --> 02:00:31,330
你神勇的朋友回歸了麼
Get your powerful friend on the case?

1477
02:00:31,330 --> 02:00:34,790
我會盡力的 但我需要Fox
I'm trying, but I need Fox.

1478
02:00:34,860 --> 02:00:39,000
等車靠近了 按下開關
Once it approaches, flick the switch.

1479
02:00:39,000 --> 02:00:41,570
針跳到了200 就給我個信號
The needle hit 200, you give me the signal.

1480
02:00:41,580 --> 02:00:43,270
我就給車作標記 好嗎
I'll will mark truck. Okay?

1481
02:00:44,070 --> 02:00:45,640
車來了 車來了
Heads up! Heads up!

1482
02:01:01,430 --> 02:01:03,940
- 有指數了 - 六點鐘方向有僱傭兵
- I got it! - Mercenaries at your 6.

1483
02:01:04,240 --> 02:01:07,780
別動 手舉在我們能看到的地方
Stand still! Keep your hands where we can see them!

1484
02:01:09,410 --> 02:01:12,160
Gordon局長 你被捕了
Commissioner Gordon, you're under arrest.

1485
02:01:12,160 --> 02:01:13,470
誰給你的權利
On who's authority?

1486
02:01:13,470 --> 02:01:15,670
哥譚人民
People of Gotham.

1487
02:01:15,670 --> 02:01:20,770
沒律師 沒證人 這算什麼聽證會
No lawyer. No witnesses. What sort of due process is this?

1488
02:01:20,770 --> 02:01:22,490
你已經被認定有罪了
You guilt have been determined.

1489
02:01:22,490 --> 02:01:24,480
這不過是量刑聽證會
This is merely a sentencing hearing.

1490
02:01:24,480 --> 02:01:26,920
你選什麼
Now what will it be?

1491
02:01:26,920 --> 02:01:29,880
死刑還是流放
Death or exile?

1492
02:01:29,980 --> 02:01:35,070
Crane 你以為我們會自願走上冰層麼
Crane, if you think we're going out on that ice willingly,

1493
02:01:35,070 --> 02:01:37,750
你錯了
you have another thing coming.

1494
02:01:39,030 --> 02:01:41,900
- 那就是死刑咯 - 我想是的
- Death then. - Looks that way.

1495
02:01:41,900 --> 02:01:45,340
很好 死刑
Very well. Death!

1496
02:01:45,940 --> 02:01:48,400
以流放的形式
By exile.

1497
02:01:50,130 --> 02:01:52,600
帶她來見我
Bring her to me!

1498
02:01:58,420 --> 02:02:00,730
嘿 下來 準備好
Hey. Going down. Get things ready.

1499
02:02:00,750 --> 02:02:02,750
行動開始
Let's gear on.

1500
02:02:09,930 --> 02:02:11,930
抓到了這傢伙 明天有得忙了
Spot this one on the spot. Got a big day tomorrow.

1501
02:02:12,030 --> 02:02:14,830
就是啊 不是每天都能逮到Bruce Wayne的
We all do. Not every day you bag Bruce Wayne!

1502
02:02:17,530 --> 02:02:19,140
- Bruce - 你沒事吧
- Bruce? - You okay?

1503
02:02:19,140 --> 02:02:21,540
你太會挑時間旅行了 Wayne先生
You pick the hell of time to go on vacation, Mr. Wayne.

1504
02:02:21,540 --> 02:02:23,340
我們還有多少時間
How long until that core ignites?

1505
02:02:23,340 --> 02:02:25,220
那核彈還有12個小時就炸了
That bomb goes off in 12 hours.

1506
02:02:25,220 --> 02:02:27,890
除非我們把它弄回反應堆裡
Unless we can reconnect it to the reactor.

1507
02:02:27,890 --> 02:02:31,660
- 你能把Miranda帶出去嗎 - 今晚不行 抱歉了
- Can you get Miranda out of here? - Not tonight. I'm sorry.

1508
02:02:31,660 --> 02:02:34,490
- 做你要做的 - 今晚我需要你
- Do what necessary. - Tonight I need you.

1509
02:02:34,500 --> 02:02:36,770
- 做什麼 - 讓我重回戰場
- What for? - To get me back in the game.

1510
02:02:36,770 --> 02:02:38,410
不好意思 掃你們的興了
Sorry to spoil things

1511
02:02:38,410 --> 02:02:41,830
孩子們 他們想親自處理這幾個人
boys but they want these guys to themselves.

1512
02:02:43,300 --> 02:02:46,460
- 我不會忘記我們事的 Miranda - 我知道
- I won't forget about us, Miranda! - I know.

1513
02:02:55,410 --> 02:02:59,020
- 我喜歡你的女朋友 Wayne先生 - 女朋友個頭
- I like your girlfriend, Mr. Wayne! - He should be so lucky.

1514
02:03:05,300 --> 02:03:07,880
我動一下Bane或是那炸彈
Any move I make on Bane or the bomb,

1515
02:03:07,880 --> 02:03:10,170
觸發者都會引爆炸彈
the trigger-man will set it off.

1516
02:03:10,170 --> 02:03:13,220
他們不會用無線電或是手機信號 太多干擾了
They won』t use radio or cell, too much interference.

1517
02:03:13,220 --> 02:03:15,030
紅外線的範圍沒那麼廣
Infrared doesn't have the range.

1518
02:03:15,030 --> 02:03:17,920
一定是某種長射程的微型脈衝
It had to be a Micro-burst, long-range.

1519
02:03:17,920 --> 02:03:19,740
- 你能攔截嗎 - 能
- Can you block it? - Yes.

1520
02:03:19,740 --> 02:03:23,920
但我需要蝙蝠車上的頻率捕獲器
But I need the EMP cannon guidance mounted on the Bat.

1521
02:03:23,920 --> 02:03:26,450
記得你停在哪兒了嘛
Remember where you parked it?

1522
02:03:40,460 --> 02:03:43,900
- 飛起來還好吧 - 好啊
- It fly okay? - Yeah.

1523
02:03:44,330 --> 02:03:46,840
雖然不能自動駕駛 真是謝謝了
Even without the autopilot. Thanks.

1524
02:03:46,840 --> 02:03:49,550
自動駕駛 你自己不能開啊
Autopilot? That's what you're there for.

1525
02:04:28,770 --> 02:04:31,410
安全了 來吧 快 過來
Thing's clear. Come on, quick! Climb.

1526
02:04:41,560 --> 02:04:43,080
封鎖起來
Lock it up!

1527
02:04:47,500 --> 02:04:49,280
你是誰
Who are you?

1528
02:05:18,090 --> 02:05:20,140
點燃它
Light it up!

1529
02:05:37,250 --> 02:05:39,250
媽媽 你看
Mom check it out.

1530
02:05:39,520 --> 02:05:41,390
親愛的 快看
Honey, take a look!

1531
02:05:50,520 --> 02:05:52,790
不可思議
Impossible!

1532
02:05:53,630 --> 02:05:57,810
看緊她 他會回來救她的
Keep her close! He'll come for her.

1533
02:05:57,810 --> 02:06:01,890
- Miranda Tate在哪兒 - Bane帶走了她
- Where's Miranda Tate? - Bane took her.

1534
02:06:01,890 --> 02:06:05,370
他佔領了市議會 守衛森嚴
He holds up city hall, surrounded by his army.

1535
02:06:05,370 --> 02:06:07,840
這個會截斷引爆信號
This blocks detonator signal to the bomb.

1536
02:06:07,840 --> 02:06:10,310
在日出前裝好
Get it on to it before sunrise.

1537
02:06:10,310 --> 02:06:12,690
必要的話 我會在開始時引爆核彈的
If I hit the button when it starts.

1538
02:06:12,690 --> 02:06:15,560
- 什麼開始時 - 戰爭
- When what start? - War.

1539
02:06:51,670 --> 02:06:52,830
還有一個沒倒呢
You missed a spot.

1540
02:06:55,970 --> 02:06:59,140
如果你獨自一人行俠仗義 戴個面具
If you're working alone, wear a mask!

1541
02:06:59,140 --> 02:07:01,460
我不畏懼直面他們
I'm not afraid if they see me standing up to these guys.

1542
02:07:01,460 --> 02:07:02,840
面具不為保護自己
The mask is not for you,

1543
02:07:02,840 --> 02:07:05,260
是為了保護你在意的人
it's to protect the people you care about.

1544
02:07:06,090 --> 02:07:08,950
數到五丟出去
Count to five and throw.

1545
02:07:18,900 --> 02:07:21,800
嘿 無意冒犯 但你就沒有火力大點的東西嗎
Hey no offense, but you got something bigger in that belt?

1546
02:07:31,600 --> 02:07:34,520
- 現在怎麼辦 - 全力攻擊Bane
- What now? - All out assault on Bane.

1547
02:07:34,520 --> 02:07:37,340
但你得帶人們過橋
But you need to get people across the bridge.

1548
02:07:37,340 --> 02:07:38,040
為什麼
Why?

1549
02:07:38,040 --> 02:07:42,680
以免我們失敗了 離開哥譚 能救多少救多少
In case we fail. Leave an exodus. Save as many lives as you can.

1550
02:07:42,680 --> 02:07:47,230
- 你不需要我嗎 - 你已經給了我一支軍隊 現在 快走
- You don't need me here? - You given me an army. Now, go!

1551
02:07:47,530 --> 02:07:50,370
- 好吧 謝謝 - 先別謝我
- Alright, thanks! - Don't thank me yet.

1552
02:07:50,370 --> 02:07:53,660
我怕以後就沒機會了
Well I might not get the chance later.

1553
02:08:06,280 --> 02:08:07,740
你真是太客氣了
You shouldn't have.

1554
02:08:08,950 --> 02:08:11,380
隧道被殘骸堵住了
All in town tunnel blocked by debris.

1555
02:08:11,380 --> 02:08:14,700
但加農炮的火力足夠為人們開道
But the cannon have anough fire power to make a path for people.

1556
02:08:14,710 --> 02:08:16,490
等到戰鬥開始前
Wait until the fighting begins!

1557
02:08:16,490 --> 02:08:19,780
你要為了你女友升級這場戰爭嗎
You going to wage your war to save your stuck up girlfriend?

1558
02:08:19,790 --> 02:08:22,140
要發動 閥門
To start it, throttle.

1559
02:08:22,140 --> 02:08:23,370
我會開
I got it.

1560
02:08:23,370 --> 02:08:25,790
你有45分鐘拯救哥譚
We have 45 minutes to save the city.

1561
02:08:25,790 --> 02:08:29,390
不 我有45分鐘逃離炸彈輻射區
No. I got 45 minutes to get clear of the blast radius.

1562
02:08:29,420 --> 02:08:30,790
因為你毫無勝算
because you don't stand a chance against these guys.

1563
02:08:30,790 --> 02:08:32,250
有你幫助 也許還有希望
With your help, I might.

1564
02:08:32,250 --> 02:08:35,160
我會打開隧道 然後離開
I open that tunnel, but then I'm gone.

1565
02:08:35,160 --> 02:08:38,710
你心裡有更好的一面
There's more to you than that.

1566
02:08:40,850 --> 02:08:44,140
不好意思一直讓你失望
Sorry to keep letting you down.

1567
02:08:46,560 --> 02:08:51,820
跟我走吧 救救你自己
Come with me! Save yourself!

1568
02:08:53,210 --> 02:08:58,450
你不欠那些人什麼 你已經為他們付出了一切
You don't owe these people anymore. You given them everything.

1569
02:08:58,450 --> 02:09:02,290
不是一切 還沒有
Not everything. Not yet.

1570
02:09:41,830 --> 02:09:46,290
散開 散開不然格殺勿論
Disperse! Disperse or be fired upon!

1571
02:09:47,120 --> 02:09:50,060
這座城裡只有一個警察局
There's only one police in this town,

1572
02:10:28,390 --> 02:10:30,420
開火
Open fire!

1573
02:11:21,420 --> 02:11:23,490
- 來了 - 準備好
- Here it comes. - Get ready!

1574
02:11:52,860 --> 02:11:57,450
所以你回來給你的城市陪葬麼
So you came back to die with your city!

1575
02:11:57,450 --> 02:12:01,470
不 我回來阻止你
No. I came back to stop you.

1576
02:12:12,490 --> 02:12:13,600
現在
Now!

1577
02:12:26,540 --> 02:12:27,620
這不可能
That's impossible.

1578
02:12:29,460 --> 02:12:31,420
去第五大道!
Come over the fifth!

1579
02:12:46,070 --> 02:12:50,020
上車 去 你過來 你也是
Get on the bus, go ahead. You come with me! You too!

1580
02:12:50,020 --> 02:12:53,410
嘿 你 你和你 過來
Hey you, you and you, come here!

1581
02:12:53,410 --> 02:12:55,350
其他人上車 好麼
Everyone else get on the bus! Okay.

1582
02:12:55,350 --> 02:12:56,370
你們 挨家挨戶的敲門
You guys, you're going

1583
02:12:56,370 --> 02:12:58,370
把消息傳開 就說
to knock on doors and spread the word okay.

1584
02:12:58,370 --> 02:13:01,510
炸彈快爆炸了 從南街隧道離開
The bomb going to go off. Get out by South Street tunnel.

1585
02:13:01,540 --> 02:13:02,630
或者穿過橋
or over the bridge.

1586
02:13:02,640 --> 02:13:04,280
每個人兩個街區
You go, you do two blocks,

1587
02:13:04,280 --> 02:13:06,880
傳完話就回車上來 好嗎 去吧
you get back to the bus. Alright? Go! Go!

1588
02:13:07,680 --> 02:13:11,860

- Is he back? - Keep your eyes open. Go!

1589
02:14:33,900 --> 02:14:36,090
去守門
Cover the doors!

1590
02:14:38,820 --> 02:14:41,950
引爆器在哪兒 在哪兒
Where's your trigger? Where is it?

1591
02:14:43,060 --> 02:14:46,440
你不會給普通市民的
You never gave it to any ordinary citizen.

1592
02:14:46,440 --> 02:14:49,050
在哪兒 引爆器在哪兒
Where is it? Where's the trigger?

1593
02:14:49,360 --> 02:14:52,130
在哪兒
Where is it?

1594
02:15:00,380 --> 02:15:03,880
告訴我引爆器在哪兒
Tell me where the trigger is.

1595
02:15:03,880 --> 02:15:06,740
然後 我准許你死
Then, you have my permission to die.

1596
02:15:18,700 --> 02:15:23,790
我把你廢了 你怎麼回來的
I broke you. How did you come back?

1597
02:15:23,800 --> 02:15:25,400
你以為你是唯一一個
You think you're the only

1598
02:15:25,400 --> 02:15:28,150
可以從那逃離的人嗎
one who could learn the strength to escape?

1599
02:15:28,150 --> 02:15:32,820
- 引爆器在哪兒 - 但我從未逃離過
- Where's the trigger? - But I never escaped.

1600
02:15:33,590 --> 02:15:35,990
但那孩子
But the child,

1601
02:15:36,890 --> 02:15:39,520
忍者大師的孩子 飛躍淵井的孩子
Child of Ra's Al Ghul's, who made the climb.

1602
02:15:39,520 --> 02:15:42,780
但他不是忍者大師的孩子
But he's not the child of Ra's Al Ghul.

1603
02:15:45,450 --> 02:15:47,360
我才是
I am.

1604
02:15:47,360 --> 02:15:53,170
儘管我並不普通 但我也是個市民
Although I'm not ordinary, I'm a citizen.

1605
02:16:12,350 --> 02:16:13,880
Miranda
Miranda?

1606
02:16:16,290 --> 02:16:17,650
為什麼
Why?

1607
02:16:17,950 --> 02:16:23,620
Talia 我媽媽臨死前 給我取名叫Talia
Talia. My mother named me Talia before she was killed.

1608
02:16:23,630 --> 02:16:29,570
如果不是Bane一直守護我 我也早就死了
The way I have been killed if not for my protector, Bane.

1609
02:16:37,250 --> 02:16:38,370
再見
Good bye.

1610
02:16:40,490 --> 02:16:43,480
我爬出了淵井
I climbed out of the pit.

1611
02:16:48,500 --> 02:16:51,050
找到了我的父親
I found my father

1612
02:16:53,180 --> 02:16:57,080
帶他回去血債血償
and brought him back to exact terrible vengeance.

1613
02:16:57,080 --> 02:16:59,130
但那時
But by that time,

1614
02:16:59,230 --> 02:17:04,230
獄徒們和醫生已經對我的朋友下了毒手
the prisoners and the doctor had their work to my friend,

1615
02:17:04,230 --> 02:17:05,520
我的守護者
my protector.

1616
02:17:09,290 --> 02:17:12,490
影武者聯盟接納了我們 訓練了我們
The League took us in and trained us

1617
02:17:12,490 --> 02:17:16,640
但我的父親無法接受Bane
but my father could not accept Bane.

1618
02:17:16,640 --> 02:17:20,280
他認為他是魔鬼 他的存在
He saw only a monster, whose very existence

1619
02:17:20,280 --> 02:17:24,450
象徵著他妻子被囚禁並死去的地獄
was the reminder of the hell he left his wife to die in.

1620
02:17:24,460 --> 02:17:27,840
他把Bane逐出了影武者聯盟
He excommunicated Bane from The League of Shadows.

1621
02:17:27,840 --> 02:17:33,150
他唯一的罪就是他愛上了我
His only crime was that he loved me.

1622
02:17:34,360 --> 02:17:38,060
我一直無法原諒我的父親
I could not forgive my father.

1623
02:17:41,710 --> 02:17:44,270
直到你殺了他
Until you murdered him.

1624
02:18:01,290 --> 02:18:06,750
他試圖殺死數以百萬的無辜之人
He was trying to kill millions of innocent people.

1625
02:18:06,790 --> 02:18:11,920
在哥譚 無辜這個詞未免言過其實
Innocence is a strong word to throw around Gotham roose.

1626
02:18:13,310 --> 02:18:17,060
我以完成他的大業向他致敬
I honor my father by finishing his work.

1627
02:18:28,410 --> 02:18:31,120
手刃殺父仇人
Vengeance against the man who killed

1628
02:18:31,120 --> 02:18:34,120
不過是對我耐心的獎勵
him is simply a reward for my patience.

1629
02:18:35,140 --> 02:18:36,420
你看
You see?

1630
02:18:37,370 --> 02:18:42,440
就是這種遲鈍的刀子 這種花時間的刀子
It's the slow knife. The knife that takes it's time.

1631
02:18:45,470 --> 02:18:51,100
那種隱忍多年 充滿執念的刀子 
The knife that wait years, without forgetting,

1632
02:18:51,110 --> 02:18:55,600
悄然滑入骨間
then slip quietly between the bones,

1633
02:18:55,600 --> 02:19:00,110
入肉最深
that's the knife that cut deepest.

1634
02:19:00,180 --> 02:19:01,930
求求你
Please!

1635
02:19:08,800 --> 02:19:12,730
也許那刀子太鈍了
Maybe that knife was too slow.

1636
02:19:12,790 --> 02:19:14,830
卡車被襲擊了
The truck is under attacked.

1637
02:19:14,830 --> 02:19:18,270
Gordon 你給了他屏蔽我的信號的方法
Gordon. You gave him a way to block my signal

1638
02:19:18,570 --> 02:19:20,560
無所謂
No matter.

1639
02:19:22,360 --> 02:19:25,410
哥譚不過能多苟延殘喘11分鐘而已
He's bought Gotham 11 minutes.

1640
02:19:25,990 --> 02:19:27,990
快點
Come on!

1641
02:19:35,000 --> 02:19:37,020
退回去 你想幹嘛
Stay back! What are you doing?

1642
02:19:37,020 --> 02:19:40,590
Blake 重案組 我要送他們去安全的地方
Blake. MCU, I'm getting these boys to safety

1643
02:19:40,590 --> 02:19:42,550
你會害死我們的
You're going to get us all killed.

1644
02:19:42,550 --> 02:19:45,680
如果有人越過這座橋 他們就會炸了整座城
If anyone cross this bridge, they'll blow up the city.

1645
02:19:45,680 --> 02:19:48,880
反正都會爆炸的 我們需要打開這座橋 現在
It going to blow up anyway. We need to open this bridge, now!

1646
02:19:48,880 --> 02:19:52,650
警官 如果你向前一步 我們就開槍了
Detective, if you take one step forward we will shoot you!

1647
02:19:52,650 --> 02:19:56,420
如果再走一步 我們就會炸橋
If you do two forward, we will blow the bridge.

1648
02:19:58,410 --> 02:20:00,740
回車上等我
Go back to the bus and wait for me alright!

1649
02:20:00,740 --> 02:20:01,940
回去等著就好
Just go back and wait.

1650
02:20:04,940 --> 02:20:06,460
他們準備了護送隊
They've prepared a convoy.

1651
02:20:06,460 --> 02:20:09,160
我們必須在炸彈爆炸之前保護好它
We must secure the bomb until it detonates!

1652
02:20:10,030 --> 02:20:14,160
別殺了他 我想讓他感受那熱浪
Don't kill him. I want him to feel the heat.

1653
02:20:14,160 --> 02:20:18,370
1200萬個靈魂 燃燒的熱浪
Heat the fire of 12 million souls.

1654
02:20:18,400 --> 02:20:19,710
你失敗了

1655
02:20:25,310 --> 02:20:27,880
再見了 我的朋友
Good bye, my friend!

1656

繼續向前 奪回那階梯

你的不殺人政策
About the whole no guns thing,

1662
02:21:20,880 --> 02:21:24,910
真是很難認同

We have to force them to the entrance of the reactor.

I need you on the ground. I'll be leaving. Go!

The situation has changed! Your orders are out of date.

1668

射他的膝蓋
Shoot at his knee.

1671
02:22:27,830 --> 02:22:30,320
空中優勢很不錯吧
Nothing like a little air superiority.

1672
02:22:30,320 --> 02:22:35,770
警官 請停下 求你了 警官 快停下

Give me a hand! We can get a cable on it!

這炸彈絕不可能停下來
There's no way this bomb will be stopped.

1693
02:26:49,260 --> 02:26:50,840
你在做什麼
What are you doing?

1694
02:26:51,040 --> 02:26:51,980
從輻射裡保護他們
Protect them from the blast!

1695
02:26:51,980 --> 02:26:53,380
我們會沒事的 快點兒 快

Shouldn't the people know the hero who saved them?
