蝙蝠侠：黑暗骑士崛起

7
00:01:00,352 --> 00:01:03,572
我认识哈维・丹特
I knew Harvey Dent.

8
00:01:04,314 --> 00:01:05,907
我们是朋友
I was his friend.

9
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:14,243
恐怕很难再有人能像他那样 激励我们 鼓舞我们
And it will be a very long time before someone inspires us the way he did.

10
00:01:16,493 --> 00:01:18,587
他是我们的信仰
I believed in Harvey Dent.

11
00:01:37,598 --> 00:01:40,442
帕沃博士 我是中情局的 
Dr. Pavel, I'm CIA.

12
00:01:40,601 --> 00:01:41,648
不只他一个人
He wasn't alone.

13
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:43,860
你不能带朋友来
Uh, you don't get to bring friends.

14
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:45,860
他们不是我朋友
They are not my friends.

15
00:01:46,023 --> 00:01:48,025
别担心 多送你两个我不加钱
Don't worry, no charge for them.

16
00:01:48,275 --> 00:01:50,496
我要他们有什么用
And why would I want them? 

17
00:01:50,496 --> 00:01:51,996
这些人要抢你的战利品
They were trying to grab your prize.

18
00:01:52,237 --> 00:01:53,830
他们的老板是雇佣军 
They work for the mercenary.

19
00:01:54,364 --> 00:01:55,866
那个戴面具的
The masked man.

20
00:01:56,533 --> 00:01:57,911
贝恩
Bane?

21
00:01:57,911 --> 00:01:58,911
嗯
Aye.

22
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:01,668
让他们登机 我去汇报
Get them on board. I'll call it in.

23
00:02:10,255 --> 00:02:12,599
这次航班的乘客名单里面
The flight plan I just filed with the agency...

24
00:02:12,758 --> 00:02:16,979
有我 我的同事 还有帕沃博士
...lists me, my men, Dr. Pavel here...

25
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:19,356
而你们只有一个名额
...but only one of you!

26
00:02:21,933 --> 00:02:26,655
谁先开口说话 我就让他留在我的飞机上
First one to talk gets to stay on my aircraft!

27
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:37,245
是谁雇你们绑架帕沃博士的
Who paid you to grab Dr. Pavel?

28
00:02:42,037 --> 00:02:44,381
他飞得不够漂亮
He didn't fly so good!

29
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:46,541
还有谁想试试看
Who wants to try next?

30
00:02:47,501 --> 00:02:49,128
跟我说说贝恩 他为什么戴面具
Tell me about Bane!

31
00:02:49,294 --> 00:02:50,796
他为什么戴面具
Why does he wear the mask?

32
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:55,968
你们干嘛要为那种人卖命
A lot of loyalty for a hired gun!

33
00:02:56,134 --> 00:02:59,809
也许他没有想通为什么要先开一枪
Well, perhaps he's wondering why someone would shoot a man...

34
00:02:59,971 --> 00:03:03,100
然后再准备把他扔出飞机
...before throwing him out of a plane.

35
00:03:07,062 --> 00:03:08,780
好吧 你开口了
At least you can talk.

36
00:03:08,939 --> 00:03:10,065
你是谁
Who are you?

37
00:03:10,232 --> 00:03:12,701
我是谁不重要
It doesn't matter who we are.

38
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:15,324
我们的计划才是重点
What matters is our plan.

39
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:25,085
我不戴面具的时候 没人想知道我是谁
No one cared who I was till I put on the mask.

40
00:03:26,665 --> 00:03:28,667
摘掉面具就会死吗
If I pull that off, will you die?

41
00:03:28,834 --> 00:03:31,007
未必会死 但一定很疼
It would be extremely painful.

42
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:32,341
你很壮 没事的
You're a big guy.

43
00:03:32,504 --> 00:03:33,721
我是说你
For you.

44
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:39,887
被逮捕也是你计划的一部分
Was getting caught part of your plan?

45
00:03:40,178 --> 00:03:41,555
一点没错
Of course.

46
00:03:46,518 --> 00:03:50,022
帕沃博士拒绝了我们 还投靠了你
Dr. Pavel refused our offer in favor of yours.

47
00:03:50,188 --> 00:03:53,692
- 我想知道他说了些什么 - 我没说 我什么也没说
- We had to find out what he told you... - Nothing. I said nothing.

48
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:10,630
那恭喜你了 贝恩 你现在被逮捕了
Well, congratulations, you got yourself caught!

49
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:11,517
长官
Sir?

50
00:04:11,517 --> 00:04:14,217
你那个伟大计划的下一步是什么
Now what's the next step of your master plan?

51
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:16,806
飞机坠毁
Crashing this plane...

52
00:04:22,137 --> 00:04:23,639
所有乘客遇难
...with no survivors.

53
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:48,042
求救 求救
Mayday, Mayday!

54
00:05:34,292 --> 00:05:37,466
啊 你在干嘛 快放开我 
Aah! What you doing to me? Let me out!

55
00:05:40,507 --> 00:05:41,804
不
No!

56
00:05:42,384 --> 00:05:44,102
不 不 不 不
No, no, no! No!

57
00:05:55,856 --> 00:05:58,575
我们两个得有一个成为遇难者
No! They expect one of us in the wreckage, brother.

58
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:02,203
我们能成功吗
Have we started the fire?

59
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:05,949
是的 我不能忍受失败
Yes, the fire rises.

60
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:18,470
别紧张 博士 还没有到害怕的时候
Calm down, doctor. Now is not the time for fear.

61
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:20,843
好戏还在后面
That comes later.

62
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:51,245
哈维・丹特日并不是一个古老的节日
Harvey Dent Day may not be our oldest public holiday...

63
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:54,460
我们聚集在此是因为它意义重大
...but we're here tonight because it's one of the most important.

64
00:06:54,623 --> 00:06:58,753
正因为哈维・丹特不屈不挠地打击犯罪组织
Harvey Dent's uncompromising stand against organized crime...

65
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:03,049
才使今天的哥谭市比他八年前牺牲的时候 更安全
...had made Gotham a safer place than it was at the time of his death, eight years ago.

66
00:07:03,214 --> 00:07:06,388
哥谭有了历史性的转变
This city has seen a historic turnaround.

67
00:07:06,593 --> 00:07:11,895
没有城市能杜绝犯罪 但我们通过丹特法案让执法部门如虎添翼
No city is without crime, but this city is without organized crime because the Dent Act...

68
00:07:12,057 --> 00:07:15,277
有效打击和铲除了犯罪组织
...gave law enforcement teeth in its fight against the mob.

69
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:19,110
现在有人提出要废除丹特法案
Now people are talking about repealing the Dent Act...

70
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:22,276
只要我在任一天 你们想都别想
...and to them I say, "Not on my watch."

71
00:07:23,777 --> 00:07:26,530
我要感谢韦恩基金会举办这次活动
I want to thank the Wayne Foundation for hosting this event.

72
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:30,826
虽然韦恩先生没能出席 但他的心与我们同在
I'm told Mr. Wayne couldn't be here tonight. I'm sure he's with us in spirit.

73
00:07:30,992 --> 00:07:33,745
现在有请一位重要嘉宾发言
And now I'm gonna give way to an important voice...

74
00:07:33,912 --> 00:07:36,381
你见过韦恩参加这种活动吗
You ever lay eyes on Wayne at one of these things?

75
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:38,257
没有 他消失好多年了
No one has. Not in years.

76
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:42,296
而人们寄希望一个穿披风戴面具的刽子手
... people put their faith in a murderous thug in a mask and a cape. 

77
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:46,012
最终 他暴露了他的本性
A thug who showed his true nature...

78
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:48,643
他背叛了这个伟大的人 
...when he betrayed the trust of this great man...

79
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:51,312
残忍地杀害了他
...and murdered him in cold blood.

80
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:54,391
宝贝 别那么急着端走啊
Sweetheart, not so fast with the chow.

81
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:55,559
想要虾球
Shrimp balls?

82
00:07:55,559 --> 00:07:56,559
谢谢
Thank you.

83
00:07:56,726 --> 00:08:00,196
吉姆・高顿会告诉大家关于哈维・丹特的真相 他最有发言权了 
Jim Gordon can tell you the truth about Harvey Dent. I'll let him tell you himself.

84
00:08:00,355 --> 00:08:01,823
有请高顿局长
Commissioner Gordon.

85
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:12,625
真相
The truth?

86
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:18,840
我本来
I have...

87
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:21,752
写了份稿子 
...written a speech...

88
00:08:22,961 --> 00:08:25,760
想说说那件事的真相
...telling the truth about Harvey Dent.

89
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:32,892
可现在还不是时候
Maybe the time isn't right.

90
00:08:36,683 --> 00:08:39,277
也许现在
Maybe right now...

91
00:08:39,436 --> 00:08:42,064
在座各位只需要知道
...all you need to know is that there are...

92
00:08:42,731 --> 00:08:47,032
因为有了丹特法案 1000多名罪犯被关进了黑门监狱
...1000 inmates in Blackgate Prison as a direct result of the Dent Act.

93
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:52,120
这些人都是犯罪组织的成员 都穷凶极恶
These are violent criminals, essential cogs in the organized-crime machine.

94
00:08:52,323 --> 00:08:57,204
各位 现在我对哈维・丹特的死 能说的只有这些
Maybe, for now, all I should say about the death of Harvey Dent is this:

95
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:02,716
他没有白白牺牲
It has not been for nothing.

96
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:07,714
- 你见过这里的主人吗  - 我听说
- You see the guy who owns the house? -  No. I heard...

97
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:10,851
- 他一直待在东楼里 - 我听说他出了意外
- ...he never leaves the east wing. - I heard he had an accident.

98
00:09:11,009 --> 00:09:13,764
脸上都是疤 所以他一直在
Yeah, that he's disfigured. He has to wear a... 

99
00:09:13,764 --> 00:09:14,764
提尔先生
Mr. Till?

100
00:09:15,055 --> 00:09:18,650
提尔先生 为什么我看见你们的人在用我们的主楼梯
Why are your people using the main staircase?

101
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:21,148
博尔顿太太呢
And where's Mrs. Bolton?

102
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:24,022
她在吧台 要帮忙吗
Uh, she's at the bar, sir. Can I help?

103
00:09:24,189 --> 00:09:25,406
你去东楼的客厅
The east drawing room.

104
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:30,571
打开门 把托盘放在桌上 然后锁上门离开 听懂了吗
Unlock the door, put the tray on the table, lock the door again. Nothing more.

105
00:09:34,616 --> 00:09:36,994
对不起 泰特小姐 他还是不肯见你
I'm sorry, Miss Tate. I tried, but he won't see you. 

106
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:39,166
你可千万别往心里去
And you mustn't take it personally.

107
00:09:39,496 --> 00:09:43,342
大家都知道 韦恩谢绝一切来访 躲在房间里 
Everyone knows that Wayne's holed up in there with 8-inch nails...

108
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,173
连上厕所都用尿壶
...peeing into Mason jars.

109
00:09:45,335 --> 00:09:47,713
谢谢你让我参加晚宴
It's very good of you to let me on the grounds.

110
00:10:00,058 --> 00:10:03,403
何必要把时间浪费在那家伙身上
Why are you wasting your time trying to talk to a man...

111
00:10:03,561 --> 00:10:08,283
他把你投资的钱都用在了拯救世界这种毫无意义的事情上了
...who threw away your investment on some save-the-world vanity project?

112
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:10,694
他没法帮你挣钱而我能
He can't get your money back. I can.

113
00:10:11,486 --> 00:10:15,866
我要跟你解释一下 拯救世界这种事情
I could try explaining that a save-the-world project, vain or not...

114
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:18,455
就算不成功 也值得投资
...is worth investing in, Mr. Daggett.

115
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:21,792
不过以你的智商 只能理解钱 和钱能买到的东西
But you understand only money and the power you think it buys...

116
00:10:21,996 --> 00:10:24,920
我何必浪费时间呢 失陪了
...so why waste my time indeed?

117
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:26,960
第二班交报告了吗
Second shift reports in?

118
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:29,221
你应该跟市长多交流交流
You should spend more time with the mayor.

119
00:10:29,379 --> 00:10:31,256
那不是你的工作吗
Well, that's your department.

120
00:10:32,257 --> 00:10:34,055
犯罪统计数字不是下降了吗
Anyone shown him the crime stats?

121
00:10:34,217 --> 00:10:37,517
他不相信数字 只相信直觉 他觉得有问题
He goes by his gut and it bothers him, no matter what the numbers.

122
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:39,159
他老婆能受得了吗 
Must be popular with his wife. 

123
00:10:39,159 --> 00:10:41,559
怎么可能 带着孩子去克利夫兰了
Not really. She took the kids to Cleveland.

124
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:45,945
他会有时间陪孩子的 市长很快会炒了他
He'll have plenty of time for visits. The mayor's gonna dump him in the spring.

125
00:10:46,104 --> 00:10:47,651
- 真的吗 - 嗯
- Really? - Mm-hm.

126
00:10:47,814 --> 00:10:49,094
可他是英雄
But he's a hero.

127
00:10:49,094 --> 00:10:51,394
天下太平 要什么英雄
A war hero. This is peacetime.

128
00:11:21,848 --> 00:11:25,227
对不起 对不起 我真的很抱歉 韦恩先生
Oh, sorry, sorry. I'm so terribly sorry, Mr. Wayne.

129
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:29,360
你是韦恩先生 对吧
It is Mr. Wayne, isn't it?

130
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:37,205
虽然你看上去好像一点也不邋遢 脸上也没有疤
Although you don't have the long nails or, heh, the facial scars, sir.

131
00:11:38,072 --> 00:11:40,200
大家是这么说我的
Is that what they say about me?

132
00:11:40,575 --> 00:11:43,454
那是因为很久没见你了
It's just that no one ever sees you.

133
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:47,833
项链很漂亮 让我想起我母亲的那条
That's a beautiful necklace. Reminds me of one that belonged to my mother.

134
00:11:47,999 --> 00:11:51,094
不过应该不是同一条
It can't be the same one...

135
00:11:51,586 --> 00:11:54,760
因为她的项链锁在保险箱里
...because her pearls are in this safe...

136
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:59,098
当初制造商跟我保证过 没人能破解 
...the manufacturer clearly explained...

137
00:12:01,888 --> 00:12:03,606
这个保险箱
...is uncrackable.

138
00:12:08,895 --> 00:12:10,613
奥普斯 
Oops.

139
00:12:10,772 --> 00:12:12,991
没人告诉我它质量这么好
Nobody told me it was uncrackable.

140
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:17,161
很抱歉 我不能放你走
I'm afraid I can't let you take those.

141
00:12:17,779 --> 00:12:21,283
听着 你不会打女人 我也不会打一个瘸子
Look, you wouldn't beat up a woman any more than I would beat up a cripple.

142
00:12:22,825 --> 00:12:26,170
不过呢 事情总有例外的时候
Of course, sometimes exceptions have to be made.

143
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:33,507
晚安 韦恩先生
Good night, Mr. Wayne.

144
00:12:48,685 --> 00:12:50,062
能搭车吗
Can I have a ride?

145
00:12:50,561 --> 00:12:51,733
我万分荣幸
You read my mind.

146
00:12:52,522 --> 00:12:54,069
开车
Let's go.

147
00:12:55,066 --> 00:12:56,864
泰特小姐又来求见了
Miss Tate was asking to see you again.

148
00:12:57,026 --> 00:12:58,653
她还真是执着 
She's very persistent.

149
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:01,164
而且很漂亮 你动心了吧
And quite lovely, in case you were wondering.

150
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:02,395
没有 
I wasn't.

151
00:13:02,395 --> 00:13:03,395
你在干嘛
What are you doing?

152
00:13:03,658 --> 00:13:06,958
我在看指纹粉 我们被盗了
Examining print dust. We've been robbed.

153
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,090
这只能怪你自己 谁让你不开警报器
And this is your idea of, uh, sounding the alarm, is it?

154
00:13:10,248 --> 00:13:12,421
那女人偷了带追踪器的项链
She took the pearls, tracking device and all.

155
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:13,880
- 女人 - 一个女仆
- She? - One of the maids.

156
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:16,671
也许你不该让她们到我这边来
Perhaps you should stop letting them in this side of the house.

157
00:13:16,838 --> 00:13:19,307
也许你该学学怎么自己铺床
Perhaps you should start learning to make your own bed.

158
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:22,394
你采指纹干什么
Why were you dusting for prints? 

159
00:13:22,394 --> 00:13:23,394
不是我
I wasn't.

160
00:13:24,262 --> 00:13:25,730
是她在采
She was.

161
00:13:29,017 --> 00:13:32,066
局长 吉利议员的夫人刚刚报案说
Sir. Congressman Gilly's wife has been calling in.

162
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:36,108
议员昨天参加韦恩基金会的晚宴后一直没回家
The congressman never made it home after the Wayne Foundation event.

163
00:13:36,774 --> 00:13:38,447
警察还要管家务事
That's a job for the police?

164
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:41,453
你和丹特把犯罪组织都铲除了
When you and Dent cleaned the streets, you cleaned them good.

165
00:13:41,612 --> 00:13:45,412
以后我们就只能帮图书馆追查没还的书了
Pretty soon we'll be chasing down, uh, overdue library books.

166
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:51,336
可你 可你还是一副形势严峻的样子
And yet here you are, like we're still at war.

167
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:54,544
你叫什么 孩子
What's your name, son?

168
00:13:54,544 --> 00:13:55,544
布雷克 长官
Blake, sir.

169
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:57,508
你是不是有什么话想问我
You have something you want to ask me?

170
00:13:59,756 --> 00:14:03,101
那个晚上 八年前 丹特死的那个晚上
It's about that night. This night, eight years ago. The night Dent died.

171
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:05,227
蝙蝠侠最后一次露面
The last confirmed sighting of the Batman.

172
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:08,477
他杀了很多人 干掉两支特警队
He murders those people, takes down two SWAT teams...

173
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:12,394
扭断丹特的脖子 然后就消失了
...breaks Dent's neck and then just vanishes?

174
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:15,196
你到底想要问什么
I'm not hearing a question, son.

175
00:14:15,355 --> 00:14:17,323
不想知道他是谁吗
Don't you want to know who he was?

176
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:20,614
我很清楚他是谁
I know exactly who he was.

177
00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:24,577
他是蝙蝠侠
He was the Batman.

178
00:14:26,783 --> 00:14:29,536
我们还是去见见议员的夫人吧
Let's go see about the congressman's wife.

179
00:14:38,378 --> 00:14:39,846
韦恩少爷
Master Wayne?

180
00:14:41,631 --> 00:14:43,599
韦恩少爷
Master Wayne?

181
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:16,833
你很久没有到下面来了
You haven't been down here in a long time.

182
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:20,549
我在调查那个偷项链的女贼 我对比了指纹
Trying to find out more about our jewel thief. I ran her prints.

183
00:15:20,795 --> 00:15:22,513
除非她以前是个大胖子
Unless she's lost a lot of weight...

184
00:15:23,798 --> 00:15:26,142
不然她用的肯定是别人的指纹 
...she was wearing someone else's fingerprints.

185
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:27,426
她很专业
She's good.

186
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:31,143
或许吧 不过我们在项链上装了追踪器
She may be, but we have a trace on the necklace.

187
00:15:31,305 --> 00:15:33,933
是啊 我把她去的地方
We do. I cross-referenced the address she went back to...

188
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:37,695
和警方的高档住宅入室盗窃案资料做了对比 找到了
...with police data on high-end B-and-E's, and, um...

189
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:39,939
萨琳娜・凯尔
Selina Kyle.

190
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:44,953
警察每次都晚到一步 她的赃物脱手很快
The databases are full of close-calls, tips from fences.

191
00:15:45,111 --> 00:15:49,116
作案手法也很巧妙 不过她的好运快到头了
She's good, but the ground is shrinking beneath her feet.

192
00:15:49,282 --> 00:15:52,035
我们得在她把项链脱手前报警
We should send the police before she fences the pearls.

193
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:54,420
不会的 她喜欢那项链 
She won't. She likes them too much.

194
00:15:54,579 --> 00:15:56,377
再说她的目标不是珠宝
And they weren't what she was after.

195
00:15:56,539 --> 00:15:57,633
那是什么
What was she after?

196
00:15:57,633 --> 00:15:58,633
我的指纹
My fingerprints.

197
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:01,795
保险箱上有碳粉和石墨的混合物
It was printer toner mixed with graphite on the safe.

198
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:04,555
采指纹用着方便 还不留痕迹
It gives a good pull and it's untraceable.

199
00:16:04,714 --> 00:16:07,558
有意思 你们应该找机会好好切磋切磋
Fascinating. You two should exchange notes over coffee.

200
00:16:07,717 --> 00:16:10,015
你是想撮合我跟那个女贼吗
You're trying to set me up with a jewel thief?

201
00:16:10,178 --> 00:16:14,649
只要你快乐 就算把你和母猩猩撮合在一起我也愿意
At this point, I'd set you up with a chimpanzee, if it brought you back to the world.

202
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:17,060
没有什么东西能让我快乐 
There's nothing out there for me.

203
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:18,812
问题就在这儿
And that's the problem.

204
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:21,527
你摘了面具脱了披风 可你还是放不下
You hung up your cape and your cowl but you didn't move on.

205
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:23,987
你得重新开始去找真爱
You never went to find a life. To find someone.

206
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:25,527
阿尔弗雷德
Alfred...

207
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:28,325
我有过真爱
...I did find someone.

208
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:29,910
我知道 可她死了 
I know, and you lost them.

209
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:32,040
不过生活就是这样
But that's all part of living, sir.

210
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:36,330
可你没在生活 你在等待 等待灾难再次降临
But you're not living, you're just waiting, hoping for things to go bad again.

211
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:38,005
你成为蝙蝠侠之前
Remember when you left Gotham?

212
00:16:38,164 --> 00:16:41,168
曾经离开过 离开过哥谭
Before all this, before Batman?

213
00:16:41,918 --> 00:16:42,965
你走了七年
You were gone seven year.

214
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:47,724
我一直在等 等了七年 我希望你不要再回来
Seven years I waited, hoping that you wouldn't come back.

215
00:16:47,882 --> 00:16:51,512
每年我都去佛罗伦萨度假
Every year, I took a holiday. I went to Florence.

216
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:53,930
在阿莫河畔有一家小餐馆
There's this Caf é on the banks of the Arno.

217
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:57,350
每天晚上我会去那儿喝一杯菲奈特・布兰卡
Every fine evening I'd sit there and order a Fernet Branca.

218
00:16:58,184 --> 00:17:00,403
我总是想家
I had this fantasy...

219
00:17:01,521 --> 00:17:04,195
当我朝对面的桌子望去 
...that I would look across the tables...

220
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:08,327
会看到你 带着妻子 
...and I'd see you there, with a wife.

221
00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:10,326
或许还有几个孩子
Maybe a couple of kids.

222
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:16,286
那时 我们两个人 不用说什么
You wouldn't say anything to me, nor me to you.

223
00:17:17,578 --> 00:17:21,299
我就已经知道 你过得很好
But we'd both know that you'd made it.

224
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:23,801
你很幸福
That you were happy.

225
00:17:26,671 --> 00:17:30,392
我从来不希望你回到哥谭
I never wanted you to come back to Gotham.

226
00:17:31,551 --> 00:17:36,057
我知道这个地方只会带给你痛苦 还有不幸
I always knew there was nothing here for you, except pain and tragedy.

227
00:17:36,222 --> 00:17:39,101
我不想看到你过这种日子
And I wanted something more for you than that.

228
00:17:44,105 --> 00:17:45,448
永远不想
I still do.

229
00:17:49,694 --> 00:17:52,538
这里每个月都会发现几具尸体
They wash up here a couple of times a month.

230
00:17:52,697 --> 00:17:54,165
冬天的时候更多
More when it gets colder.

231
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:56,291
流浪汉都住在下面
Homeless, sheltering in the tunnels.

232
00:17:57,952 --> 00:18:02,082
我们只是把他拉出来 别的都没动过
We pulled him from the basin, but other than that we didn't touch him.

233
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:05,585
怎么了 
What? 

234
00:18:05,585 --> 00:18:07,674
他叫吉米 是圣斯维奇孤儿院的
 Name's Jimmy.  He's from St. Swithin's.

235
00:18:08,296 --> 00:18:12,221
我给他们当球队教练
It's the boys' home where I coach some ball.

236
00:18:15,011 --> 00:18:16,729
吉米已经离开一阵子了
Jimmy hadn't been around for months.

237
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:17,890
为什么
No? Why?

238
00:18:17,890 --> 00:18:19,390
你知道为什么
Blake, you know why.

239
00:18:19,557 --> 00:18:23,403
他超龄了 我们没能力收留超过16岁的孩子
He aged out. We don't have the resources to keep boys on after 16.

240
00:18:23,561 --> 00:18:25,655
我以为韦恩基金会在补助你们
I thought the Wayne Foundation gave money for that.

241
00:18:25,813 --> 00:18:27,907
几年前就停了
Not for the past couple of years.

242
00:18:28,065 --> 00:18:30,211
他弟弟在这儿 对吗
He has a brother here, doesn't he?

243
00:18:30,211 --> 00:18:31,911
马克 我会告诉他
Mark. I'll tell him.

244
00:18:32,069 --> 00:18:35,073
如果可以 还是我去吧
I'd like to, if that's all right.

245
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:38,292
你知道他去那里干什么吗
You know what he was doing in the tunnels?

246
00:18:38,451 --> 00:18:42,297
过了年纪没法待在孤儿院里的人都会去那儿
Lot of guys been going down the tunnels when they age out.

247
00:18:44,582 --> 00:18:46,676
听说可以住在那里 
Say you can live down there.

248
00:18:47,335 --> 00:18:48,882
还可以在里面工作
Say there's work down there.

249
00:18:49,045 --> 00:18:50,547
工作
Work?

250
00:18:50,838 --> 00:18:53,512
下水道里能有什么工作
What kind of work are you gonna find in the sewers?

251
00:18:53,674 --> 00:18:56,302
没准比地面上的工作还要多呢
More than you can find up here, I guess.

252
00:18:57,178 --> 00:18:58,430
你知道蝙蝠侠
So you know about him?

253
00:18:58,596 --> 00:18:59,848
当然
Of course.

254
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:03,355
你觉得他会回来吗
Do you think he's coming back?

255
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:06,858
不知道
I don't know.

256
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:22,249
你带了伴儿
You brought a date?

257
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:25,631
我喜欢带个跟班 帮我开门
I like having someone around to open doors for me.

258
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:29,760
右手 完整指纹
Right hand. No partials.

259
00:19:33,673 --> 00:19:36,142
- 干得漂亮 - 嗯
- Very nice. - Mm-hm.

260
00:19:36,967 --> 00:19:39,015
别心急 帅哥 
Not so fast, handsome.

261
00:19:39,303 --> 00:19:40,555
我要的东西呢
You got something for me?

262
00:19:42,139 --> 00:19:43,641
啊 对
Ah, yes.

263
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:56,321
我不知道你想要韦恩先生的指纹干什么
I don't know what you're planning to do with Mr. Wayne's prints...

264
00:19:56,487 --> 00:19:59,286
不过拇指的指纹一定用得上
...but I'm guessing you'll need his thumb.

265
00:20:00,074 --> 00:20:02,168
你不太会数数吧
You don't count so good, huh?

266
00:20:02,326 --> 00:20:03,578
我会数数
I count fine.

267
00:20:03,994 --> 00:20:07,168
事实上 我要从一数到十
In fact, I'm counting to 10 right now.

268
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:10,672
好
Okay.

269
00:20:14,797 --> 00:20:17,471
我朋友在外面 等我的消息
My friend's outside. Just hit "send."

270
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:30,571
这里真冷清
This place is a little dead.

271
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:33,984
等会儿就热闹了 相信我
It'll liven up in a minute. Trust me.

272
00:20:35,568 --> 00:20:36,694
你没事吧
Is everything okay?

273
00:20:36,861 --> 00:20:38,863
没事 一会儿见
Great. Catch you later.

274
00:20:43,534 --> 00:20:44,877
嗯
Hmm.

275
00:20:45,536 --> 00:20:47,880
如果按当初说好的办 
It would have been a lot easier...

276
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:50,253
可以省掉很多麻烦
...to just give me what we agreed.

277
00:20:50,458 --> 00:20:52,836
我们不能留活口
We can't have loose ends.

278
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:56,840
就算你是个性感的妞 死了也没人在意
And even in that dress, no one's gonna miss you.

279
00:20:57,006 --> 00:20:58,508
不
No.

280
00:20:58,674 --> 00:21:00,551
是啊 可全城的警察
But my friend over there?

281
00:21:00,718 --> 00:21:03,892
现在都在找我男朋友
Every cop in the city's missing him.

282
00:21:04,054 --> 00:21:05,397
很聪明 
That's cute.

283
00:21:05,556 --> 00:21:08,275
不过他们绝对不会找到这儿来的
But they're not gonna be looking in a place like this.

284
00:21:08,601 --> 00:21:11,354
这很难说 因为你刚用过他的手机
I don't know. You did just use his cell phone.

285
00:21:21,572 --> 00:21:22,949
快跟上
Go!

286
00:21:39,256 --> 00:21:40,929
站住 不许动 警察
Police! Get down now!

287
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:45,346
救救我
Help me! Help me!

288
00:21:45,513 --> 00:21:47,561
求求你 求求你 救救我
elp me, please! Please help me!

289
00:21:58,025 --> 00:22:00,369
好好压着伤口
Keep some pressure on that, sweetheart.

290
00:22:02,947 --> 00:22:04,073
打给我
Call me?

291
00:22:07,076 --> 00:22:08,129
你没事吧
You okay, miss?

292
00:22:08,129 --> 00:22:09,329
他在流血 快救救他
He's bleeding. You gotta help him.

293
00:22:14,625 --> 00:22:15,717
我找到议员了
I got the congressman.

294
00:22:44,655 --> 00:22:45,952
快过来
Clear!

295
00:22:50,077 --> 00:22:54,048
把井盖打开 叫水电局派人过来
Manhole! Get this up! Get the DWP down here!

296
00:22:54,999 --> 00:22:56,546
你们三个 跟我走
You three, down with me.

297
00:22:56,709 --> 00:23:00,134
你们两个 下去 守住下个出口
You two, you go down, cover the next exit!

298
00:23:16,812 --> 00:23:18,155
他们下去了
What, they went down there?

299
00:23:49,595 --> 00:23:50,769
我们要下去 对吗
We're gonna go down there, right?

300
00:23:50,769 --> 00:23:51,769
刚才是煤气爆炸
That was a gas explosion, kid.

301
00:23:52,932 --> 00:23:54,186
煤气 这是下水道
Wasn't gas. It's a sewer.

302
00:23:54,186 --> 00:23:56,186
没搞清楚情况之前 谁也不许下去
No one goes in till we know what's there.

303
00:23:56,352 --> 00:23:58,195
情况很清楚 局长在下面
We know, sir. The police commissioner.

304
00:23:58,354 --> 00:24:00,197
谁来把这个愣头青带走
Someone get this hothead out of here?

305
00:24:00,356 --> 00:24:02,859
水电局的人怎么还没来
And where's that DWP guy?

306
00:24:45,484 --> 00:24:47,452
你来这里干嘛
Why are you here?

307
00:24:49,238 --> 00:24:50,785
快回答
Answer him.

308
00:24:52,449 --> 00:24:54,372
我是在问你
I was asking you.

309
00:24:54,743 --> 00:24:56,290
这是警察局长
It's the police commissioner.

310
00:25:00,082 --> 00:25:02,551
你怎么会把他带下来的
And you brought him down here?

311
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:04,804
我们不知道该怎么办
We didn't know what to do.

312
00:25:04,804 --> 00:25:05,804
你慌了
You panicked.

313
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:09,308
因为你的软弱害死了三个人
And your weakness has cost the lives of three others.

314
00:25:09,466 --> 00:25:10,592
不 他是一个人
No, he's alone.

315
00:25:14,471 --> 00:25:16,018
搜他的身 
Search him.

316
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:17,728
然后你就可以死了
Then I will kill you.

317
00:25:47,254 --> 00:25:48,178
他死了
He's dead.

318
00:25:48,178 --> 00:25:50,178
把尸体给我找出来
So show me his body.

319
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:53,765
这里的水流向很复杂 我们找不到她
The water runs to any one of the outflows. We'd never find him.

320
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:00,981
跟他去
Follow him! 

321
00:26:00,981 --> 00:26:01,981
跟他去
Follow him?

322
00:26:17,743 --> 00:26:19,541
局长 局长 嗨
You okay? You okay?

323
00:26:19,703 --> 00:26:21,626
你没事吧
Hey, hey, you awake?

324
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:29,880
我要见布鲁斯・韦恩
I need to see Bruce Wayne.

325
00:26:30,047 --> 00:26:32,516
对不起 韦恩先生不见没有预约的访客
I'm sorry, Mr. Wayne doesn't take unscheduled calls.

326
00:26:32,674 --> 00:26:34,472
警察也不例外
Even from a police officer.

327
00:26:34,635 --> 00:26:38,310
如果我去申请调查丹特谋杀案的搜查令
And if I go get a warrant for the investigation of Harvey Dent's murder?

328
00:26:38,472 --> 00:26:40,691
这样也算没有预约
That still count as unscheduled?

329
00:26:44,853 --> 00:26:46,901
找我有事吗
What can I do for you, officer?

330
00:26:47,231 --> 00:26:49,325
高顿遭到枪击
Commissioner Gordon's been shot.

331
00:26:51,652 --> 00:26:53,700
他追一个歹徒 进了下水道
He chased a gunman down into the sewers.

332
00:26:53,862 --> 00:26:57,207
我救他出来的时候 他说地下有支军队
When I pulled him out, he was babbling about an underground army.

333
00:26:57,366 --> 00:26:59,209
有个戴面具的 叫贝恩
A masked man called Bane.

334
00:27:00,035 --> 00:27:02,379
这个你应该去跟你的上司汇报
Shouldn't you be telling your superior officers?

335
00:27:02,538 --> 00:27:05,633
他们不相信高顿的话 说他有幻觉
They asked me if he saw any giant alligators.

336
00:27:06,083 --> 00:27:07,801
他需要你
He needs you.

337
00:27:09,378 --> 00:27:10,675
他需要蝙蝠侠
He needs the Batman.

338
00:27:12,422 --> 00:27:14,222
如果高顿局长认为
If Commissioner Gordon thinks...

339
00:27:14,222 --> 00:27:16,222
他根本就不在乎你是谁
Oh, he doesn't know or care who you are.

340
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:18,978
我们以前倒是见过
But we've met before.

341
00:27:20,097 --> 00:27:24,227
那会儿我还是个孩子 在圣斯维奇
It was a long time ago. I was a kid. Uh, St. Swithin's.

342
00:27:24,893 --> 00:27:28,614
韦恩基金会曾经赞助过 这个孤儿院
It used to be funded by the Wayne Foundation. It's an orphanage.

343
00:27:29,565 --> 00:27:33,695
我很小的时候 妈妈出车祸死了我没什么印象
My mom died when I was small. It was a car accident, I don't really remember it.

344
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:39,496
不过 几年后我爸爸 因为欠赌债被人枪杀
But my dad got shot a couple years later over a gambling debt...

345
00:27:39,741 --> 00:27:42,995
那件事我记得很清楚
...and I remember that one just fine.

346
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:47,253
没多少人理解那个感觉 不是吗
Not a lot of people know what it feels like, do they?

347
00:27:47,624 --> 00:27:49,376
那种愤怒 
To be angry...

348
00:27:50,127 --> 00:27:51,970
刻骨的愤怒
...in your bones.

349
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:56,679
刚开始 那些养父母  他们能理解
I mean, they understand.

350
00:27:57,259 --> 00:27:58,681
他们能理解
Foster parents.

351
00:27:58,844 --> 00:28:00,846
每个人都能理解
Everybody understands...

352
00:28:01,138 --> 00:28:02,640
接下来 
...for a while.

353
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:07,111
他们希望愤怒的孩子去做一件他们做不到的事
And then they want the angry little kid to do something he knows he can't do.

354
00:28:07,686 --> 00:28:08,778
忘记过去
Move on.

355
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:11,322
很快他们就失去耐心
So after a while, they stop understanding.

356
00:28:11,481 --> 00:28:13,358
把那孩子送进孤儿院
They send the angry kid to a boys' home.

357
00:28:13,734 --> 00:28:17,534
我明白得太晚了 我们得学会隐藏愤怒 
I figured it out too late. You gotta learn to hide the anger.

358
00:28:18,238 --> 00:28:20,582
对着镜子练习微笑
Practice smiling in a mirror.

359
00:28:22,409 --> 00:28:23,911
就像戴上面具
It's like putting on a mask.

360
00:28:25,162 --> 00:28:28,712
有一天你出现在孤儿院 开着好车
So you showed up this one day, in a cool car.

361
00:28:28,874 --> 00:28:30,717
搂着美女
Pretty girl on your arm.

362
00:28:31,793 --> 00:28:33,591
我们好兴奋 
We were so excited.

363
00:28:33,879 --> 00:28:36,473
布鲁斯・韦恩 孤儿亿万富翁
Bruce Wayne, billionaire orphan.

364
00:28:36,924 --> 00:28:40,679
我们常常编一些关于你的故事 传奇
I mean, we used to make up stories about you, man. Legends.

365
00:28:40,844 --> 00:28:44,644
知道吗 对其他孩子 那只是故事
And, you know, with the other kids, that's all it was, just stories, but...

366
00:28:46,266 --> 00:28:48,519
可是 当我看到你 就知道你是谁
Right when I saw you, I knew who you really were.

367
00:28:49,978 --> 00:28:52,777
我发现你脸上的表情
I'd seen that look on your face before.

368
00:28:53,815 --> 00:28:55,943
就是我教自己的那种
It's the same one I taught myself.

369
00:28:57,903 --> 00:29:00,782
我不明白 你干嘛为丹特的死背黑锅
I don't know why you took the fall for Dent's murder...

370
00:29:01,657 --> 00:29:03,705
不过我一直相信蝙蝠侠
...but I'm still a believer in the Batman...

371
00:29:04,534 --> 00:29:06,207
你相信吗
...even if you're not.

372
00:29:08,914 --> 00:29:13,841
你为什么说韦恩基金会曾经赞助过这家孤儿院
Why did you say that your boys' home used to be funded by the Wayne Foundation?

373
00:29:14,002 --> 00:29:15,754
因为赞助中止了
Because the money stopped.

374
00:29:15,921 --> 00:29:20,142
出去呼吸一下新鲜空气吧 基金会是你名下的
Might be time to get some fresh air. Start paying attention to the details.

375
00:29:21,009 --> 00:29:23,387
好歹也要上点心
Some of those details might need your help.

376
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:26,523
你查了吗 那个贝恩
You check that name? Bane?

377
00:29:26,682 --> 00:29:29,356
他是雇佣兵 好像没别的名字
He's a mercenary. No other known names.

378
00:29:29,518 --> 00:29:31,987
他和手下在西非策划了一场政变
Him and his men were behind a coup in West Africa...

379
00:29:32,145 --> 00:29:36,651
为我们的朋友约翰・达盖特争取到采矿权
...that secured mining operations for our friend John Daggett.

380
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:39,158
达盖特把他们带到这儿 
Now Daggett's brought them here.

381
00:29:39,158 --> 00:29:40,158
好像是这样
Or so it seems.

382
00:29:42,239 --> 00:29:43,367
我会继续调查
I'll keep digging.

383
00:29:43,367 --> 00:29:44,367
好的
Yeah.

384
00:29:45,575 --> 00:29:51,799
阿尔弗雷德 为什么韦恩基金会停止赞助城里的孤儿院了
Alfred, why did the Wayne Foundation stop funding boys' homes in the city?

385
00:29:51,957 --> 00:29:57,054
这个基金会的钱是从 是从 韦恩集团的利润里来的
The foundation is funded by the profits of Wayne Enterprises.

386
00:29:57,379 --> 00:29:58,926
应该不会缺钱
There have to be some.

387
00:29:59,089 --> 00:30:01,434
看来我得跟福克斯先生谈谈
Time to talk to Mr. Fox, I think.

388
00:30:01,434 --> 00:30:02,434
我帮你拨电话
I'll get him on the phone.

389
00:30:02,592 --> 00:30:06,597
不不不 现在我们家里面还有车吗
No, no, no. Do we still have any cars around the place?

390
00:30:06,763 --> 00:30:08,640
有个 一两辆
Yes. One or two.

391
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:10,809
帮我预约医院 我要检查腿
I need an appointment at the hospital for my leg.

392
00:30:10,976 --> 00:30:11,929
哪家医院
Which hospital?

393
00:30:11,929 --> 00:30:13,929
吉姆・高顿住的那家
Whichever one Jim Gordon's in.

394
00:30:18,108 --> 00:30:19,907
我没有看到病变的软骨
I have seen worse cartilage in knees.

395
00:30:19,907 --> 00:30:20,907
那很好
That's good.

396
00:30:21,069 --> 00:30:23,572
不 那是因为你的膝盖里没有软骨了 
No. That's because there is no cartilage in your knee.

397
00:30:23,739 --> 00:30:27,084
你肘部和肩部的软骨也很糟糕 没法医治
And not much of any use in your elbows or your shoulders.

398
00:30:27,242 --> 00:30:29,620
除此之外 你肾脏上的瘢痕组织
Between that and the scar tissue on your kidneys...

399
00:30:29,786 --> 00:30:32,460
脑震荡遗留下来的脑组织创伤
...the residual concussive damage to your brain tissue...

400
00:30:32,622 --> 00:30:35,296
还有你全身上下这么多的伤疤
...and the general scarred-over quality of your body...

401
00:30:35,459 --> 00:30:37,383
所以我不建议你参加直升机滑雪 韦恩先生
...I cannot recommend that you go heli-skiing.

402
00:30:37,383 --> 00:30:38,383
好的
Right.

403
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:56,355
我们三个并肩作战
We were in this together...

404
00:30:58,482 --> 00:31:00,029
可后来你走了
...then you were gone.

405
00:31:00,192 --> 00:31:03,320
这里不需要蝙蝠侠了 我们赢了
The Batman wasn't needed any more. We won.

406
00:31:03,486 --> 00:31:05,615
可是这一切建立在谎言上
Based on a lie.

407
00:31:07,074 --> 00:31:13,127
现在邪恶势力又卷土重来
And now there's evil rising from where we tried to bury it.

408
00:31:13,330 --> 00:31:17,801
我们需要蝙蝠侠回来
The Batman has to come back.

409
00:31:17,959 --> 00:31:20,428
要是他不存在了呢
What if he doesn't exist any more?

410
00:31:20,587 --> 00:31:24,057
他必须回来
He must.

411
00:31:37,771 --> 00:31:39,614
你偷了我的钱包
You took my goddamn wallet, didn't you?

412
00:31:39,773 --> 00:31:42,652
- 你偷了我的钱包 -没有
- You f... You took my wallet! - No, I...

413
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,379
出去
Get out.

414
00:31:44,379 --> 00:31:45,579
她偷了我的 
She took my... Ah!

415
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:46,331
快滚
Now!

416
00:31:46,831 --> 00:31:47,831
该死
Creep!

417
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:51,414
他至于生这么大气吗 里面才60块
I don't know what he's so upset about. There's only 60 bucks in here.

418
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:53,328
可能是为了手表
Probably the watch.

419
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:09,640
那是谁
Who's that?

420
00:32:09,803 --> 00:32:11,931
哪个爬不出跑车的老家伙吗
A stiff can barely climb out of his sports car.

421
00:32:12,097 --> 00:32:13,225
不 是布鲁斯・韦恩
No, that's Bruce Wayne!

422
00:32:13,225 --> 00:32:14,225
韦恩先生 看这边
Mr. Wayne, over here!

423
00:32:19,271 --> 00:32:20,649
我不知道我的助理有没有
I'm not sure if my assistant...

424
00:32:20,649 --> 00:32:21,649
这边请 韦恩先生
Right through here.

425
00:32:21,815 --> 00:32:23,317
非常感谢
Thank you so much.

426
00:32:28,572 --> 00:32:32,372
布鲁斯・韦恩参加慈善舞会
Bruce Wayne at a charity ball.

427
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:35,287
泰特小姐 是吗
Miss Tate, isn't it?

428
00:32:36,288 --> 00:32:39,337
隐居前你好像也从来不参加这种活动
Even before you became a recluse, you never came to these things.

429
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:43,170
善款都花在美食上 一点也不慈善
The proceeds go to the big fat spread. It's not about charity.

430
00:32:43,336 --> 00:32:47,682
不过可以让某个自我感觉良好的老女人得到满足
It's about feeding the ego of whichever society hag laid this on.

431
00:32:48,175 --> 00:32:50,598
事实上 这个舞会是我组织的
Actually, this is my party, Mr. Wayne.

432
00:32:50,886 --> 00:32:52,433
哦
Oh.

433
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:57,935
善款都用在公益事业上 活动的费用全是我自己掏腰包
And the proceeds will go where they should, because I paid for the big fat spread myself.

434
00:32:58,351 --> 00:32:59,728
你真是慷慨
That's very generous of you.

435
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:03,824
想要这个世界变得更好 你就得投资
You have to invest if you want to restore balance to the world.

436
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:05,734
就像清洁能源项目
Take our clean-energy project.

437
00:33:06,276 --> 00:33:08,904
很遗憾 有时候投资未必有收益
Sometimes the investment doesn't pay off.

438
00:33:09,696 --> 00:33:10,671
有收益
I'm sorry.

439
00:33:10,671 --> 00:33:13,271
我知道你的冷漠是装出来的
You have a practiced apathy, Mr. Wayne.

440
00:33:13,533 --> 00:33:18,664
如果你真的不关心这个世界 你不会把大量财产用在拯救世界上
But a man who doesn't care about the world doesn't spend half his fortune to save it.

441
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:22,668
更不会因为计划失败而难过
And isn't so wounded when it fails...

442
00:33:23,084 --> 00:33:24,711
因为消沉而隐居
...that he goes into hiding.

443
00:33:26,171 --> 00:33:28,265
祝你愉快 韦恩先生
Have a good evening, Mr. Wayne.

444
00:33:32,302 --> 00:33:33,975
我能不能
Mind if I cut in?

445
00:33:35,055 --> 00:33:36,898
谢谢
Thank you.

446
00:33:39,768 --> 00:33:41,042
看见我不太高兴啊
You don't seem happy to see me.

447
00:33:41,042 --> 00:33:42,842
你不是把自己关在家吗
You were supposed to be a shut-in.

448
00:33:43,104 --> 00:33:44,981
我想出来透透气
I felt like some fresh air.

449
00:33:45,774 --> 00:33:47,902
你为什么不报警
Why didn't you call the police?

450
00:33:48,235 --> 00:33:50,909
我有个很厉害的朋友能帮我解决
I have a powerful friend who deals with things like this.

451
00:33:51,071 --> 00:33:55,372
飞贼装扮成这样 太高调了吧
That's a brazen costume for a cat burglar.

452
00:33:55,909 --> 00:33:58,503
是吗 那你装的又是谁
Yeah? Who are you pretending to be?

453
00:33:58,662 --> 00:34:01,381
布鲁斯・韦恩 古怪的亿万富翁
Bruce Wayne, eccentric billionaire.

454
00:34:02,457 --> 00:34:03,459
那人是谁
Who's your date?

455
00:34:03,459 --> 00:34:04,459
他老婆在伊莉莎岛 
His wife's in Ibiza.

456
00:34:04,626 --> 00:34:08,426
她担心钻石会被偷走 所以全都放在家里
She left her diamonds behind, though. Worried they might get stolen.

457
00:34:08,588 --> 00:34:10,636
那地方叫伊莉莎岛
It's pronounced "Ibiza."

458
00:34:11,216 --> 00:34:14,891
万一被人发现你是个骗子 你可就麻烦了
You wouldn't want these folks realizing you're a crook, not a social climber.

459
00:34:15,053 --> 00:34:18,182
你以为我会在乎这些人怎么看我吗
You think I care what anyone in this room thinks of me?

460
00:34:19,849 --> 00:34:22,193
我觉得你不在乎任何人对你的看法
I doubt you care what anyone in any room thinks of you.

461
00:34:22,352 --> 00:34:26,073
别跟我来这套 韦恩先生 你根本不了解我
Don't condescend, Mr. Wayne. You don't know a thing about me.

462
00:34:26,690 --> 00:34:30,911
好吧 萨琳娜・凯尔 你住在旧城区的老公寓里
Well, Selina Kyle, I know you came here from your walk-up in Old Town.

463
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:32,912
对珠宝大盗来说够低调的
A modest place for a master jewel thief.

464
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:36,371
这可能表示你在为退休攒钱
Which means that either you're saving for retirement...

465
00:34:36,992 --> 00:34:39,086
要不就是惹了大麻烦
...or you're in deep with the wrong people.

466
00:34:40,412 --> 00:34:44,383
别以为你生在豪宅的主卧室里 就有资格评论我
You don't get to judge me because you were born in the master bedroom of Wayne Manor.

467
00:34:44,541 --> 00:34:46,887
我是生在酒店房间里的
Actually, I was born in the Regency Room.

468
00:34:46,887 --> 00:34:48,887
我干这行是生活所迫
I started out doing what I had to.

469
00:34:50,046 --> 00:34:53,425
可一旦趟了这浑水 这一辈子就再也洗不清了
Once you've done what you had to, they never let you do what you want to.

470
00:34:53,592 --> 00:34:54,844
怎么会呢
Start fresh.

471
00:34:55,010 --> 00:34:58,230
这个时代想要重新开始是不可能的
Ugh. There's no fresh start in today's world.

472
00:34:58,388 --> 00:35:01,437
谁都能轻易查出你的过去
Any 12-year-old with a cell phone could find out what you did.

473
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:05,400
我们做的一切都会被记录在案 永远别想摆脱
Everything we do is collated and quantified. Everything sticks.

474
00:35:05,979 --> 00:35:07,981
所以你干脆就这么干下去
Is that how you justify stealing?

475
00:35:08,148 --> 00:35:10,742
我只从有钱人那里拿我需要的东西
I take what I need from those who have more than enough.

476
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:13,198
我从来不对穷人下手
I don't stand on the shoulders of people with less.

477
00:35:13,361 --> 00:35:14,408
罗宾汉
Robin Hood?

478
00:35:14,571 --> 00:35:18,701
我对社会的贡献比你和这里的大部分人都要多
I think I'd do more to help someone than most of the people in this room. Than you.

479
00:35:19,659 --> 00:35:21,753
你的自我感觉会不会太好了
You think maybe you're assuming a little too much?

480
00:35:21,911 --> 00:35:25,961
有没有想过 要是没那几个臭钱 哪个女人会对你感兴趣
Maybe you're being unrealistic about what's really in your pants other than your wallet.

481
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:27,171
喔
Ouch.

482
00:35:27,667 --> 00:35:32,764
你以为能一直这样 暴风雨就要来了 韦恩先生
You think all this can last? There's a storm coming, Mr. Wayne.

483
00:35:33,381 --> 00:35:37,602
你和你的朋友们最好小心点 因为到那个时候 
You and your friends better batten down the hatches, because when it hits...

484
00:35:37,761 --> 00:35:41,641
你们就会意识到 怎么能只顾着自己寻欢作乐
...you're all gonna wonder how you ever thought you could live so large...

485
00:35:41,806 --> 00:35:44,901
根本不考虑其他人的死活
...and leave so little for the rest of us.

486
00:35:48,188 --> 00:35:50,691
你好像很期待那天
You sound like you're looking forward to it.

487
00:35:52,108 --> 00:35:53,701
因为我能适应
I'm adaptable.

488
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:57,114
这项链戴在你身上比放保险箱里好看
Those pearls do look better on you than they did in my safe.

489
00:35:57,864 --> 00:36:00,083
可我还是不能给你
But I still can't let you keep them.

490
00:36:07,749 --> 00:36:09,922
你把她吓跑了
You... You scared her off!

491
00:36:12,837 --> 00:36:14,384
不见得吧
Not likely.

492
00:36:16,508 --> 00:36:17,885
我的停车券丢了
Must have lost my ticket.

493
00:36:18,051 --> 00:36:19,804
您太太说您坐出租车回家
Your wife said you were taking a cab home.

494
00:36:19,804 --> 00:36:20,804
我太太
My wife?

495
00:36:28,853 --> 00:36:30,275
就你一个
Just you, sir?

496
00:36:33,358 --> 00:36:35,360
别担心 少爷
Don't worry, Master Wayne.

497
00:36:36,111 --> 00:36:39,160
用不了多久 你又能左拥右抱了
Takes a little time to get back in the swing of things.

498
00:36:41,324 --> 00:36:44,578
布鲁斯・韦恩 真是稀客
Bruce Wayne, as I live and breathe.

499
00:36:46,371 --> 00:36:48,749
是什么把你从冬眠状态唤醒的
What brings you out of cryo-sleep, Mr. Wayne?

500
00:36:48,915 --> 00:36:50,667
你的幽默感还在
You haven't lost your sense of humor.

501
00:36:50,834 --> 00:36:53,337
可是你把我的钱 都给弄丢了
Even if you have lost most of my money.

502
00:36:53,503 --> 00:36:55,005
不是我 是你自己
Actually, you did that.

503
00:36:55,171 --> 00:36:57,890
你把所有的研发经费
If you funnel your entire R and D budget...

504
00:36:58,049 --> 00:37:00,973
全都投在能源项目里 然后又把这项目搁置不动 
...into a fusion project that you then mothball...

505
00:37:01,136 --> 00:37:03,480
这样公司怎么可能盈利 
...your company is unlikely to thrive.

506
00:37:03,638 --> 00:37:04,685
我该怎么办
What are my options? 

507
00:37:04,848 --> 00:37:07,226
你可以选择启用那台机器
Well, if you're unwilling to turn on the machine...

508
00:37:08,101 --> 00:37:09,944
不行 这不行 卢修斯
I can't. I can't, Lucius.

509
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:12,067
那什么也别做
Well, then sit tight.

510
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:13,948
你是大股东 达盖特没法动你
Your majority keeps Daggett at bay...

511
00:37:14,107 --> 00:37:18,112
我们可以考虑在能源计划上和米兰达・泰特合作
...while we figure out a future for the energy program with Miranda Tate.

512
00:37:18,278 --> 00:37:20,906
她一直都在支持我们的项目
She has supported the project all the way.

513
00:37:21,322 --> 00:37:24,496
她聪明 长得也挺漂亮
She's smart. And quite lovely.

514
00:37:25,493 --> 00:37:28,542
我们都是为了你的利益着想
We all just want what's best for you, Bruce.

515
00:37:29,289 --> 00:37:31,041
给她看那机器
Show her the machine.

516
00:37:31,958 --> 00:37:33,255
我会考虑的
I'll think it over.

517
00:37:33,418 --> 00:37:34,761
有别的事吗
Anything else?

518
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:37,172
没有 怎么
Nope. Why?

519
00:37:37,338 --> 00:37:41,388
过去你每次来这儿 总是会提些特殊要求
These conversations used to end with an unusual request.

520
00:37:42,135 --> 00:37:43,557
我退休了
I retired.

521
00:37:43,845 --> 00:37:47,941
我给你看几个小玩意儿
Mm-hm. Well, let me show you some stuff anyway.

522
00:37:52,061 --> 00:37:53,563
就当是怀旧吧
Just for old times' sake.

523
00:37:58,026 --> 00:38:00,074
我还以为这地方已经没了
I figured you'd have shut this place down.

524
00:38:00,236 --> 00:38:02,910
按照官方说法 是这样
Oh, it was always shut down, officially.

525
00:38:03,072 --> 00:38:04,164
这么多新东西
All this new stuff.

526
00:38:04,324 --> 00:38:08,955
你父亲去世后 韦恩集团设立了14家军工类的子公司
After your father died, Wayne Enterprises set up 14 different defense subsidiaries.

527
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:11,794
这些年我一直在整合资源
For years, I've been shuttering and consolidating...

528
00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:14,334
把设计原型集中到一个地方
...all the different prototypes under one roof.

529
00:38:14,501 --> 00:38:16,219
- 就是这儿 - 为什么
- My roof. - Why?

530
00:38:16,503 --> 00:38:19,177
防止它们落到坏人手里
Keep them from falling into the wrong hands.

531
00:38:22,008 --> 00:38:24,431
喔 这玩意儿太炫了
Oh, now you're just showing off.

532
00:38:25,595 --> 00:38:30,226
为国防部设计的 专门用在人口密集的城市里
Defense Department projects for tight geometry urban pacification.

533
00:38:30,725 --> 00:38:35,322
水平旋翼不用再循环就能在大楼间任意穿梭
Rotors are configured to maneuver between buildings without recirculation.

534
00:38:35,772 --> 00:38:37,274
它叫什么
What's it called?

535
00:38:37,899 --> 00:38:42,120
韦恩集团给它起了个又长又没意思的名字
Oh, it has a long, uninteresting Wayne Enterprises designation.

536
00:38:42,278 --> 00:38:45,657
但我喜欢叫它 蝙蝠
I just took to calling it the Bat.

537
00:38:46,574 --> 00:38:49,202
我知道你想问什么 有黑色的
And, yes, Mr. Wayne, it does come in black.

538
00:38:50,995 --> 00:38:53,965
性能良好 但不能自动驾驶
Works fine, except for the autopilot.

539
00:38:54,415 --> 00:38:56,338
得找比我聪明的人去改进
Takes a better mind than mine to fix it.

540
00:38:56,501 --> 00:38:57,878
比你聪明
Better mind?

541
00:38:58,628 --> 00:39:01,427
我是想谦虚一下
Well, I was trying to be modest.

542
00:39:01,798 --> 00:39:03,721
至少没我这么忙碌
A less busy mind.

543
00:39:04,133 --> 00:39:05,430
比如你
Yours.

544
00:39:12,976 --> 00:39:14,446
你觉得很疼
Is it really painful?

545
00:39:14,446 --> 00:39:16,446
要不你过来试试
You're very welcome to try it, Alfred.

546
00:39:16,604 --> 00:39:18,322
我看看就行了 谢谢
Happy watching. Thank you, sir.

547
00:39:21,442 --> 00:39:22,864
不错
Not bad.

548
00:39:27,907 --> 00:39:29,329
还不错
Not bad at all.

549
00:39:32,787 --> 00:39:35,916
如果你真的想重新出山
If you're seriously considering going back out there...

550
00:39:36,082 --> 00:39:38,210
我建议你 听一听关于贝恩的传闻
...you should hear the rumors surrounding Bane.

551
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:39,423
我听着呢
I'm all ears.

552
00:39:40,753 --> 00:39:44,428
在一个古老的地方有一座监狱
There is a prison in a more ancient part of the world.

553
00:39:44,924 --> 00:39:49,805
在那里 人就是去受苦等死的
A pit where men are thrown to suffer and die.

554
00:39:50,013 --> 00:39:53,734
不过 偶尔也会有人在黑暗中崛起
But sometimes a man rises from the darkness.

555
00:39:53,975 --> 00:39:58,105
重新回到我们的世界中来
Sometimes the pit sends something back.

556
00:39:58,271 --> 00:39:59,399
贝恩
Bane.

557
00:39:59,399 --> 00:40:00,399
贝恩
Bane.

558
00:40:00,690 --> 00:40:03,739
他在监狱里出生长大
Born and raised in hell on earth.

559
00:40:03,902 --> 00:40:04,827
生在监狱里
Born in a prison?

560
00:40:04,827 --> 00:40:07,827
没有人知道他是怎么逃出去的
No one knows why, or how he escaped.

561
00:40:07,989 --> 00:40:10,583
只知道他逃出去之后 
But they do know that once he did...

562
00:40:10,742 --> 00:40:14,918
就开始跟随你的老师 忍者大师
...he was trained by Ra's Al Ghul, your mentor.

563
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:17,081
他是影武者联盟的
Bane was a member of the League of Shadows?

564
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:19,421
如果连忍者大师
And then he was excommunicated.

565
00:40:19,876 --> 00:40:25,599
都觉得这个人太极端 我们更不能轻视
And any man who is too extreme for Ra's Al Ghul is not to be trifled with.

566
00:40:25,757 --> 00:40:29,011
难道说你一直觉得我很轻视他 我的对手吗
I didn't realize I was known for trifling with criminals.

567
00:40:29,636 --> 00:40:30,933
问题就在这里
That was then.

568
00:40:31,387 --> 00:40:34,186
岁月不饶人 你现在还可以穿上披风戴上面具
And you can strap up your leg and put your mask back on...

569
00:40:34,349 --> 00:40:36,943
可是身体已经和当年没法比了
...but that doesn't make you what you were.

570
00:40:37,101 --> 00:40:41,732
如果他真的像你说的那么危险 那哥谭需要我
If this man is everything that you say he is, then the city needs me.

571
00:40:41,898 --> 00:40:44,868
哥谭市需要布鲁斯・韦恩 
The city needs Bruce Wayne.

572
00:40:45,234 --> 00:40:47,157
需要你的资源和见识
Your resources. Your knowledge.

573
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:50,415
而不是你的身体 或者生命
It doesn't need your body, or your life.

574
00:40:51,199 --> 00:40:52,371
那个时代过去了
That time's past.

575
00:40:52,533 --> 00:40:55,912
你是担心 如果我重新复出 会被打败
You're afraid that if I go back out there, I'll fail.

576
00:40:56,079 --> 00:40:57,331
不
No.

577
00:40:58,957 --> 00:41:01,801
不是担心 而是遗憾
I'm afraid that you want to.

578
00:41:16,307 --> 00:41:19,481
你不能因为布鲁斯・韦恩去参加舞会就卖空
You can't short the stock because Bruce Wayne goes to a party.

579
00:41:19,686 --> 00:41:23,486
他出现市场一定会变 要么涨要么跌 我看会跌
Wayne coming back is change. Change is either good or bad. I vote bad.

580
00:41:23,648 --> 00:41:24,945
有什么根据
On what basis?

581
00:41:25,108 --> 00:41:26,655
我瞎猜的
I flipped a coin.

582
00:41:32,782 --> 00:41:34,705
等一下 全麦的 我说了不要全麦的
It says rye... I said no rye, man.

583
00:41:37,286 --> 00:41:40,085
先生 把头盔摘了 安检时需要看脸
Hey, rookie, lose the helmet. We need faces for camera.

584
00:41:46,129 --> 00:41:48,052
走吧 抢帽子去
Come on. Let's go scalping.

585
00:42:03,479 --> 00:42:04,526
快点
Come on.

586
00:42:29,589 --> 00:42:31,466
都趴下
Everybody down, now!

587
00:42:49,776 --> 00:42:52,495
这是证券交易所 没钱给你抢
This is a stock exchange. There's no money you can steal.

588
00:42:52,653 --> 00:42:56,032
是吗 那你们在这儿干嘛
Really? Then why are you people here?

589
00:43:12,507 --> 00:43:15,260
所有人都退后 到街区另一边去
Everybody, stay back! Go down to the end of the block!

590
00:43:15,426 --> 00:43:17,394
这里有紧急情况
We have an emergency situation!

591
00:43:20,681 --> 00:43:22,274
你们该冲进去
You gotta get in there!

592
00:43:22,433 --> 00:43:24,026
什么 他们挟持了人质
This is a hostage situation.

593
00:43:24,185 --> 00:43:27,610
不不不 他们在抢劫 交易柜台可以直接在线转账
No, this is a robbery. They have direct access to the online trading desk.

594
00:43:27,772 --> 00:43:29,570
不能为了你们的钱让我的人送命
I'm not risking my men for your money.

595
00:43:33,820 --> 00:43:36,164
请你离开这儿 这里有紧急状况
We have to ask you to move. We have a situation.

596
00:43:36,322 --> 00:43:38,370
不单是我们的 是所有人的钱
It's not our money, it's everybody's.

597
00:43:38,533 --> 00:43:40,627
是吗 我把钱放家里了
Really? Mine's in my mattress.

598
00:43:40,785 --> 00:43:45,291
如果你们不采取行动 经济一旦崩溃 你家里的钱就只能垫桌脚了
You don't put these guys down, that stuffing in your mattress might be worth a whole lot less.

599
00:43:45,456 --> 00:43:47,709
切断这栋楼的网络和手机信号
Cut the fiber cable and take out that cell tower.

600
00:43:47,875 --> 00:43:48,878
谢谢
Thank you.

601
00:43:48,878 --> 00:43:50,378
这能拖点时间
That'll slow them down.

602
00:43:51,045 --> 00:43:52,092
全都退后
Move back!

603
00:43:52,255 --> 00:43:54,929
请你离开 赶快离开
All the way! Go! Sir, get back, please!

604
00:43:56,425 --> 00:43:58,018
网络断了
They cut the fiber.

605
00:43:59,178 --> 00:44:00,270
手机还能用
Cell's working.

606
00:44:00,429 --> 00:44:01,772
用不了多久
For now.

607
00:44:07,436 --> 00:44:11,111
去设置路障 把路都封掉 不许任何人进出这里
Get all these barriers up. All of them up. No one gets in or out of any of these streets.

608
00:44:11,274 --> 00:44:12,901
你让我移到哪儿去
Where am I supposed to move it?

609
00:44:13,067 --> 00:44:14,364
往后退
Back it up.

610
00:44:18,948 --> 00:44:21,167
你待在车里 知道吗
All right, just stay in your vehicle, okay?

611
00:44:27,707 --> 00:44:30,130
这个程序还要运行多长时间
How much longer does the program need?

612
00:44:31,711 --> 00:44:32,883
八分钟
Eight minutes.

613
00:44:34,463 --> 00:44:35,715
现在我们该走了
Time to go mobile.

614
00:44:35,882 --> 00:44:37,225
都给我起来
Everybody, up!

615
00:44:41,470 --> 00:44:42,847
你们俩 快走
You two, move!

616
00:44:45,683 --> 00:44:46,980
谢谢
Thank you.

617
00:44:47,935 --> 00:44:49,403
稳住
Steady.

618
00:44:58,112 --> 00:44:59,489
稳住
Steady.

619
00:45:07,413 --> 00:45:08,460
目标出现了
I've got something.

620
00:45:09,582 --> 00:45:12,085
别开枪 他们有人质
Hold your fire, they've got hostages.

621
00:45:12,251 --> 00:45:13,503
别开枪
Hold your fire!

622
00:45:23,471 --> 00:45:24,973
快追
Go, go!

623
00:45:34,690 --> 00:45:36,363
求你 放了我吧
Please! Just let me go!

624
00:45:36,692 --> 00:45:39,320
求你了 放了我 求你了
Hey, please! Hey!

625
00:45:42,323 --> 00:45:43,745
打轮胎吗
Shoot the tires.

626
00:45:43,908 --> 00:45:45,376
会伤到人质的
There's no shot.

627
00:45:46,786 --> 00:45:49,915
别开枪 别开枪 劫匪手上有人质
Now back off. Back off, they've got hostages.

628
00:45:50,081 --> 00:45:52,834
警方目前正在全力追捕
... P.D. are pursuing the four suspects through downtown...

629
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,048
参与市中心劫持人质案的四名嫌疑犯
...in response to a hostage situation.

630
00:46:01,550 --> 00:46:03,223
灯怎么回事
What's going on with the lights?

631
00:46:10,142 --> 00:46:11,610
这不可能
It can't be.

632
00:46:12,061 --> 00:46:13,153
那个人是谁
What the hell was that?

633
00:46:13,312 --> 00:46:16,156
噢 孩子 今天晚上有好戏看了
Oh, boy, you are in for a show tonight, son.

634
00:46:21,654 --> 00:46:23,656
求你了 救命 救命
Please! Help, help, help!

635
00:46:41,507 --> 00:46:42,554
抱歉
Sorry.

636
00:46:43,175 --> 00:46:46,475
把枪收起来 请别伤着自己
Put that thing away before you hurt yourself. Get in!

637
00:46:46,637 --> 00:46:49,766
快上车 我们走 你 快上车 有人看到蝙蝠侠了
Let's go. You, get in the car. They've spotted the Batman.

638
00:47:01,068 --> 00:47:04,197
通知所有警员 所有的巡逻车 巡警 还有下班的
Call everyone in. Every car patrol, beat cop, off-duty too.

639
00:47:04,363 --> 00:47:07,082
全都叫来 我要做高顿做不到的事
Pull them in now. I'm gonna do what Jim Gordon never could.

640
00:47:07,241 --> 00:47:08,461
你要干嘛
What's that?

641
00:47:08,461 --> 00:47:10,261
我要抓住蝙蝠侠
I'm gonna take down the Batman.

642
00:47:10,619 --> 00:47:13,668
警方已证实 四名嫌疑犯
four suspects are carrying two hostages...

643
00:47:13,831 --> 00:47:15,879
在哥谭市证券交易所劫持了两名人质
...kidnapped from the Gotham Stock Exchange.

644
00:47:16,042 --> 00:47:19,342
- 据目击者称 - 斯科特 斯科特 你看镜头正中央 快看镜头的正中央
- Reports from the eyewitnesses... - Scott, dead center of your screen.

645
00:47:19,503 --> 00:47:21,926
- 你看到吗 - 我看到了蝙蝠侠
- What do you see?  - I see Batman.

646
00:47:22,089 --> 00:47:24,763
难以置信 这个看上去像蝙蝠侠的人
Hard to believe, but the suspects are now being pursued...

647
00:47:24,925 --> 00:47:26,893
正在追踪疑犯
...by what appears to be the Batman.

648
00:47:27,053 --> 00:47:28,145
真没想到
Well, what do you know?

649
00:47:33,309 --> 00:47:35,277
长官 那些劫匪怎么办
Sir, what about the armed robbers?

650
00:47:37,688 --> 00:47:40,658
求求你 放我走吧 求你了 你想要什么都行
Please! Just let me go! Please!

651
00:47:50,326 --> 00:47:53,796
有辆摩托掉队了 没有人质 要追吗
One bike's pulled off. No hostage. Should we pursue?

652
00:47:58,334 --> 00:47:59,881
别管他 跟着蝙蝠侠
Negative. Stay on the Batman.

653
00:48:02,797 --> 00:48:03,795
劫匪逃跑了
He's getting away.

654
00:48:03,795 --> 00:48:04,795
你更想抓谁
Who do you wanna catch?

655
00:48:04,797 --> 00:48:07,306
劫匪 还是那个杀死哈维・丹特的混蛋
Some robber, or the son of a bitch who killed Harvey Dent?

656
00:48:11,514 --> 00:48:14,017
警方封锁了整个上西区
...The entire upper west hill...

657
00:48:14,183 --> 00:48:16,231
还有中央高地和东部公园地区
Central Heights and East Park Side areas.

658
00:48:16,644 --> 00:48:19,318
躲了八年 却在今晚现身
Eight years, and he has to pick tonight.

659
00:48:19,647 --> 00:48:21,741
他把警察都引开了
He's drawing the cops off Bane.

660
00:48:30,574 --> 00:48:32,542
求你了 放我走吧 
Please! Just let me go!

661
00:48:33,035 --> 00:48:34,082
求你了
Please!

662
00:49:52,364 --> 00:49:53,741
我们跟丢了
We lost him.

663
00:49:53,991 --> 00:49:55,664
你们怎么搞的
How could you lose him?

664
00:49:55,826 --> 00:49:57,419
他的火力很强
He's got a lot of firepower.

665
00:49:57,578 --> 00:49:58,670
你的不强吗
What, and you don't?

666
00:50:03,459 --> 00:50:05,211
他回市中心了
He's heading back downtown.

667
00:50:05,377 --> 00:50:07,425
他跟他的造型一样蠢
Then he's as dumb as he dresses.

668
00:50:08,047 --> 00:50:09,640
封锁市中心
Close it off, gentlemen.

669
00:50:41,956 --> 00:50:44,459
被逼到墙角的老鼠很容易抓
Like a rat in a trap, gentlemen.

670
00:50:49,630 --> 00:50:52,759
长官 蝙蝠和老鼠可不一样
You might have the wrong animal there, sir.

671
00:51:03,644 --> 00:51:05,317
确定是他吗
You sure it was him?

672
00:51:12,152 --> 00:51:15,577
贝恩说 虽然蝙蝠侠来搅局 不过任务还是完成了
Bane says the Batman interfered, but the task was accomplished. 

673
00:51:15,739 --> 00:51:17,366
那被抓到的人呢
What about the men they arrested?

674
00:51:17,533 --> 00:51:21,629
他的原话是这么说的 他们死也会不会说的
He said, and I quote, "They would die before talking."

675
00:51:22,830 --> 00:51:25,128
这么忠心的人哪儿找来的
Where does he find these guys?

676
00:51:26,709 --> 00:51:28,461
开瓶香槟
Open the champagne.

677
00:51:30,504 --> 00:51:33,007
能找些姑娘来玩玩吗
And can we get some girls in here?

678
00:51:33,173 --> 00:51:34,595
姑娘送上门了
Careful what you wish for.

679
00:51:45,603 --> 00:51:46,946
舌头打结了
Cat got your tongue?

680
00:51:47,104 --> 00:51:48,321
你这蠢婊子
You dumb bitch.

681
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:50,574
从来没人骂过我蠢
Nobody ever accused me of being dumb.

682
00:51:50,733 --> 00:51:53,657
今天晚上你来这儿就很蠢
You're dumb for coming here tonight.

683
00:51:55,070 --> 00:51:56,743
把欠我的东西给我
I want what you owe me.

684
00:51:58,574 --> 00:52:00,497
想要不一定能得到
Want doesn't get.

685
00:52:00,993 --> 00:52:05,043
衣服很漂亮 鞋跟这么高 脚很疼吧
Nice outfit. Those heels make it tough to walk?

686
00:52:05,205 --> 00:52:06,422
我不知道 疼吗
I don't know.

687
00:52:07,041 --> 00:52:08,418
疼吗
Do they?

688
00:52:09,752 --> 00:52:11,345
- 东西在哪儿 - 什么东西
- So where is it? - Where's what?

689
00:52:11,545 --> 00:52:13,889
那个程序 我要清除程序
The program. The "clean slate."

690
00:52:14,131 --> 00:52:17,351
能清除掉你所有前科记录的程序
The ultimate tool for a master thief with a record.

691
00:52:18,093 --> 00:52:19,640
把枪放下
Hold it right there!

692
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:34,197
程序在哪儿
Where is it?

693
00:52:34,735 --> 00:52:36,328
清除程序
The clean slate?

694
00:52:36,487 --> 00:52:39,115
只要输入姓名和出生日期
Where you type in someone's name, date of birth...

695
00:52:39,281 --> 00:52:43,457
几分钟就能把你所有的前科记录清楚干净
...in a few minutes they're gone from every database on earth?

696
00:52:43,994 --> 00:52:45,793
这种事你也相信吗
Sound a little too good to be true?

697
00:52:45,793 --> 00:52:46,793
你撒谎
You're lying!

698
00:52:46,955 --> 00:52:49,549
莱晶数据公司已经做出样品了
Rykin Data took it to prototype stage.

699
00:52:49,708 --> 00:52:51,676
那家公司是我的
That's why I bought them.

700
00:52:52,586 --> 00:52:54,463
没有这种程序 
But they had nothing.

701
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:56,598
只是个传说罢了
It was a gangland myth.

702
00:53:07,935 --> 00:53:09,107
退后
Stay back!

703
00:53:12,481 --> 00:53:14,108
不然我杀了他
I'm not bluffing!

704
00:53:15,025 --> 00:53:16,402
他们知道 
They know.

705
00:53:16,819 --> 00:53:18,241
他们不在乎
They just don't care.

706
00:53:35,587 --> 00:53:36,884
你在开玩笑吗
You've gotta be kidding me.

707
00:53:37,047 --> 00:53:38,596
不用枪 也不杀人
No guns. No killing.

708
00:53:38,596 --> 00:53:39,596
那有什么乐趣
Where's the fun in that?

709
00:53:58,736 --> 00:54:01,535
我妈妈说 别随便搭陌生人的车
My mother warned me about getting into cars with strange men.

710
00:54:01,697 --> 00:54:02,744
这个不是车
This isn't a car.

711
00:54:52,873 --> 00:54:54,466
后会有期
See you around.

712
00:54:55,459 --> 00:54:56,585
不用谢
You're welcome.

713
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:58,337
我自己也能应付
I had it under control.

714
00:54:58,504 --> 00:54:59,847
他们不是小混混
Those weren't street thugs.

715
00:55:00,005 --> 00:55:02,099
是职业杀手 
They were trained killers.

716
00:55:02,257 --> 00:55:03,930
我救了你一命
I saved your life.

717
00:55:04,134 --> 00:55:08,890
作为回报 告诉我你为什么偷布鲁斯・韦恩的指纹
In return, I need to know what you did with Bruce Wayne's fingerprints.

718
00:55:09,056 --> 00:55:11,605
你就是韦恩说的那个很厉害的朋友吧
Wayne wasn't kidding about a powerful friend.

719
00:55:12,768 --> 00:55:14,645
我把指纹卖给了达盖特
I sold his prints to Daggett...

720
00:55:16,605 --> 00:55:19,074
他说好的报酬根本不存在
...for something that doesn't even exist.

721
00:55:19,358 --> 00:55:21,079
你不像是很好骗的人
I doubt many people get the better of you.

722
00:55:21,079 --> 00:55:23,079
我也有糊涂的时候
Hey, when a girl's desperate...

723
00:55:23,237 --> 00:55:24,581
那要指纹干嘛
What's he gonna do with them?

724
00:55:24,581 --> 00:55:25,581
我不知道
I don't know...

725
00:55:25,739 --> 00:55:29,118
不过 他对证券交易所的抢劫案很感兴趣
...but Daggett seemed pretty interested in that mess at the stock market.

726
00:55:34,373 --> 00:55:35,841
凯尔小姐
Miss Kyle?

727
00:55:38,752 --> 00:55:40,971
人走了也不打个招呼
So that's what that feels like.

728
00:56:00,274 --> 00:56:04,825
刚才各大电视台都在实况转播你大闹哥谭市的新闻
I see from the television coverage that you got your taste for wanton destruction back.

729
00:56:04,987 --> 00:56:06,955
我拿到了这个
I retrieved this.

730
00:56:07,114 --> 00:56:09,583
这不是应该交给警方去调查吗
Aren't the police supposed to be investigating, then?

731
00:56:09,741 --> 00:56:11,166
他们没有分析它的设备
They don't have the tools to analyze it.

732
00:56:11,166 --> 00:56:13,166
把设备捐给他们不就行了
They would if you gave them to them.

733
00:56:13,328 --> 00:56:15,831
落到坏人手里会变成武器的
One man's tool is another man's weapon.

734
00:56:15,998 --> 00:56:19,343
在你看来 什么东西都能被坏人当成武器
In your mind, perhaps. But there aren't many things you can't turn into a weapon.

735
00:56:19,501 --> 00:56:21,629
够了 阿尔弗雷德 那些警察干不了这事
Alfred, enough. The police weren't getting it done.

736
00:56:21,795 --> 00:56:25,174
如果没有蝙蝠侠 我想没准他们会振作起来
Perhaps they might have if you hadn't made a sideshow of yourself.

737
00:56:25,340 --> 00:56:27,140
你觉得我已经不行了
You thought I didn't have it in me.

738
00:56:27,140 --> 00:56:29,140
你是不行了 你开着福克斯给你的新玩具 
You led a bloated police force on a chase...

739
00:56:29,303 --> 00:56:31,897
领着全城的警察满街跑
...with a load of fancy new toys from Fox.

740
00:56:32,055 --> 00:56:34,899
等你真的面对贝恩的时候 怎么办
What about when you come up against him? What then?

741
00:56:35,058 --> 00:56:37,859
努力战斗 和以前一样
I'll fight harder. I always have.

742
00:56:37,859 --> 00:56:39,859
看看 他速度快 残暴 训练有素
Look. His speed, his ferocity, his training.

743
00:56:40,022 --> 00:56:42,696
我看到坚定的信念
I see the power of belief.

744
00:56:42,858 --> 00:56:45,782
我看到影武者联盟又卷土重来
I see the League of Shadows resurgent.

745
00:56:45,944 --> 00:56:47,412
你说他被开除了
You said he was excommunicated.

746
00:56:47,571 --> 00:56:49,448
被忍者大师开除
By Ra's Al Ghul.

747
00:56:50,490 --> 00:56:51,582
现在谁是头儿
Who leads them now?

748
00:56:51,742 --> 00:56:54,336
忍者大师就是影武者联盟 他已经死了
Ra's Al Ghul was the League of Shadows and I beat him.

749
00:56:54,494 --> 00:56:57,247
贝恩只是个雇佣兵 我们得查出他的目的
Bane is a mercenary. We need to find out what he's up to.

750
00:56:58,457 --> 00:57:01,006
像是股票交易 加密了
Trades of some kind. Coded.

751
00:57:01,835 --> 00:57:04,634
还有我的指纹 真是多亏了萨琳娜・凯尔
And my fingerprint, courtesy of Selina Kyle.

752
00:57:04,796 --> 00:57:05,888
把这个交给福克斯
Get this to Fox.

753
00:57:06,048 --> 00:57:10,394
他能破解密码 查出他们在进行什么交易
He can crack the code and tell us what trades they were executing.

754
00:57:14,056 --> 00:57:17,731
我会把它交给福克斯 但到此为止
I'll get this to Mr. Fox, but no more.

755
00:57:19,394 --> 00:57:22,944
我一直照顾你 帮你疗伤 可我不想埋葬你
I've sewn you up, I've set your bones, but I won't bury you.

756
00:57:23,357 --> 00:57:26,486
我送走太多韦恩家的人了
I've buried enough members of the Wayne family.

757
00:57:27,277 --> 00:57:28,625
你要离开我
You'll leave me?

758
00:57:28,625 --> 00:57:32,625
你坚持要做蝙蝠侠 去帮助别人
You see only one end to your journey.

759
00:57:33,075 --> 00:57:37,672
我只能用离开让你明白
Leaving is all I have to make you understand.

760
00:57:37,955 --> 00:57:41,459
你不再是蝙蝠侠了 你得另寻出路
You're not Batman any more. You have to find another way.

761
00:57:41,625 --> 00:57:45,596
你说过要退休 要放下这一切 过普通人的生活
You used to talk about finishing, about a life beyond that awful cave.

762
00:57:45,754 --> 00:57:49,475
阿尔弗雷德 瑞切尔死前我们决定要在一起
Alfred, Rachel died knowing that we had decided to be together.

763
00:57:49,633 --> 00:57:53,513
那是我向往的普通人的生活 我没法忘了她
That was my life beyond the cave. I can't just move on.

764
00:57:53,971 --> 00:57:56,815
她 本来可以很幸福
She... She didn't. She couldn't.

765
00:57:57,641 --> 00:57:59,018
如果是这样呢
What if she had?

766
00:57:59,184 --> 00:58:00,652
这 这根本不可能
She... I can't change that.

767
00:58:00,811 --> 00:58:03,815
如果 我告诉你 她死前写了封信
What if before she died she wrote a letter...

768
00:58:03,981 --> 00:58:07,451
说她选择 跟哈维・丹特在一起
...saying she chose Harvey Dent over you?

769
00:58:11,822 --> 00:58:13,165
可我 
And what if...

770
00:58:14,241 --> 00:58:16,084
为了不让你伤心
...to spare you pain...

771
00:58:17,911 --> 00:58:19,788
把那封信烧了
...I burnt that letter?

772
00:58:20,622 --> 00:58:24,843
你怎么敢用瑞切尔来阻止我
How dare you use Rachel to try to stop me?

773
00:58:25,043 --> 00:58:28,468
不 我用的都是事实 韦恩少爷
I am using the truth, Master Wayne.

774
00:58:29,131 --> 00:58:34,012
现在是时候让我们面对现实 别再回避真相
Maybe it's time we all stopped trying to outsmart the truth and let it have its day.

775
00:58:35,637 --> 00:58:36,765
我很抱歉 
I'm sorry.

776
00:58:36,765 --> 00:58:37,765
你很抱歉
You're sorry?

777
00:58:37,931 --> 00:58:40,650
你以为你颠覆了我的世界
You expect to destroy my world...

778
00:58:43,020 --> 00:58:45,398
然后道个歉就没事了吗
...and then think that we're gonna shake hands?

779
00:58:45,564 --> 00:58:47,237
不 不 
No, no, no.

780
00:58:48,483 --> 00:58:50,577
我知道 这意味着什么
I know what this means.

781
00:58:50,736 --> 00:58:51,828
意味什么
What does it mean?

782
00:58:51,987 --> 00:58:54,410
意味着你会恨我 
It means your hatred.

783
00:58:54,614 --> 00:58:58,335
意味着我会失去那个 我一直关心的人 
And it also means losing someone that I have cared for...

784
00:58:58,493 --> 00:59:02,919
从我第一次听到你的哭声
...since I first heard his cries echo...

785
00:59:03,582 --> 00:59:05,676
回荡在这栋房子里
...through this house.

786
00:59:06,001 --> 00:59:10,256
不过这也意味着 你能继续活下去
But it might also mean saving your life.

787
00:59:11,548 --> 00:59:13,971
这一点 对我更重要
And that is more important.

788
00:59:19,181 --> 00:59:20,228
再见 阿尔弗雷德
Goodbye, Alfred.

789
00:59:39,993 --> 00:59:41,210
阿尔弗雷德
Alfred?

790
00:59:46,416 --> 00:59:48,010
你自己来开门
Answering your own door?

791
00:59:48,010 --> 00:59:49,010
对
Yeah.

792
00:59:50,420 --> 00:59:51,717
第三版
Page three.

793
00:59:52,255 --> 00:59:56,260
看来 你在期货市场交易了大批认沽权证
Seems you made a series of large put options on the futures exchange...

794
00:59:56,426 --> 00:59:57,723
是用指纹验证的
...verified by thumbprint.

795
00:59:57,886 --> 01:00:00,560
那些期权昨天晚上到期
Those options expired at midnight last night.

796
01:00:00,722 --> 01:00:03,774
也许以后我们能找机会证明这是欺诈 
Long-term, we may be able to prove fraud. 

797
01:00:03,774 --> 01:00:05,774
可是现在 你已经破产了
But for now, you're completely broke...

798
01:00:05,936 --> 01:00:09,361
韦恩集团将会落到约翰・达盖特手里
...and Wayne Enterprises is about to fall into the hands of John Daggett.

799
01:00:09,523 --> 01:00:13,369
那些武器 不能让他拿到应用科学部的武器
The weapons. We can't let Daggett get his hands on Applied Sciences.

800
01:00:13,527 --> 01:00:16,497
应用科学部隐藏在暗处 他查不到
Applied Sciences is all looked up and off the books.

801
01:00:16,655 --> 01:00:19,875
但能源项目就是另一回事了
The energy project, however, is a different story.

802
01:00:20,033 --> 01:00:21,535
米兰达・泰特
Miranda Tate.

803
01:00:22,536 --> 01:00:25,836
我们要说服董事会支持她 带她去看反应堆
Let's convince the board to get behind her. Let's show her the reactor.

804
01:00:25,997 --> 01:00:29,501
我们35分钟后和她见面 换身衣服吧
We're meeting her there in 35 minutes, so you better get dressed.

805
01:00:29,835 --> 01:00:33,385
你带我来就是要让我看这个 福克斯先生
You brought me out here to show me this, Mr. Fox?

806
01:00:33,588 --> 01:00:35,556
别心急 泰特小姐
Bear with me, Miss Tate.

807
01:00:39,261 --> 01:00:42,731
千万别把头和手伸到外面去
Please keep hands and feet inside the car at all times.

808
01:00:48,311 --> 01:00:50,109
就是这里 对吗
This is it, isn't it?

809
01:00:50,689 --> 01:00:53,283
我们把反应堆造在河下游
The reactor is beneath the river...

810
01:00:53,817 --> 01:00:57,572
这样一旦发现安全问题 就能马上淹没它
...so it can be instantly flooded in the event of a security breach.

811
01:00:58,280 --> 01:01:01,204
布鲁斯是不是有点太神经过敏了
Is Bruce Wayne really that paranoid?

812
01:01:01,366 --> 01:01:03,664
这个问题我就不回答了
I'm gonna plead the fifth on that one.

813
01:01:10,542 --> 01:01:13,466
也许你想看看 投下去的钱用在了哪儿
 I thought you might like to see what your investment built.

814
01:01:13,628 --> 01:01:15,301
不用矿物燃料 
No fossil fuels.

815
01:01:15,463 --> 01:01:18,057
就能为整个城市提供清洁能源
Free clean energy for an entire city.

816
01:01:18,216 --> 01:01:21,766
三年前一个俄罗斯科学家
Three years ago, a Russian scientist published a paper... 

817
01:01:21,928 --> 01:01:24,226
发表了把聚变反应堆变成武器的文章
...on weaponized fusion reactions.

818
01:01:24,389 --> 01:01:29,316
一星期后 你的反应堆因为故障停止使用
One week later, your reactor started developing problems.

819
01:01:30,562 --> 01:01:32,189
我觉得它其实没故障
I think this machine works.

820
01:01:32,355 --> 01:01:38,988
米兰达 如果让它运转 会威胁到哥谭市
Miranda, if it were operational, the danger to Gotham would be too great.

821
01:01:39,154 --> 01:01:42,249
如果我告诉你 那个俄罗斯科学家
Would it make you feel better to know that the Russian scientist...

822
01:01:42,407 --> 01:01:45,206
半年前已经死于空难
...died in a plane crash six months ago?

823
01:01:45,368 --> 01:01:48,872
你还会这么紧张吗
Someone will work out what Dr. Pavel did.

824
01:01:49,039 --> 01:01:55,217
还会有人继续帕沃博士的研究 会有人想方设法把它变成核武器
Someone will figure out a way to make this power source into a nuclear weapon.

825
01:01:56,546 --> 01:02:00,926
米兰达 我需要你来管理韦恩集团
I need you to take control of Wayne Enterprises...

826
01:02:01,384 --> 01:02:02,636
还有这个反应堆
...and this reactor.

827
01:02:03,053 --> 01:02:04,179
我该拿它做什么
To do what with it?

828
01:02:04,346 --> 01:02:05,848
什么也不做
Nothing.

829
01:02:06,431 --> 01:02:08,559
直到我们能确保它的安全
Until we can guarantee its safety.

830
01:02:08,725 --> 01:02:09,942
要是做不到呢
And if we can't?

831
01:02:10,227 --> 01:02:11,774
那就把它毁掉
Decommission it. Flood it.

832
01:02:11,937 --> 01:02:15,737
毁掉一个让全世界用上清洁能源的好机会
Destroy the world's best chance for a sustainable future?

833
01:02:15,899 --> 01:02:17,526
不能让全世界冒险
If the world's not ready, yes.

834
01:02:17,692 --> 01:02:21,993
布鲁斯 如果你想拯救世界 你就得相信这台机器
Bruce, if you want to save the world, you have to start trusting it.

835
01:02:22,364 --> 01:02:23,741
我相信你
I'm trusting you.

836
01:02:23,907 --> 01:02:25,875
这不够 因为你没别的选择
Doesn't count. You have no choice.

837
01:02:26,618 --> 01:02:28,962
过去三年里 我随时可以毁掉这一切
I could have flooded this chamber at any time.

838
01:02:29,120 --> 01:02:31,168
而我选择了相信你
I'm choosing to trust you.

839
01:02:32,040 --> 01:02:33,257
拜托了
Please.

840
01:02:40,507 --> 01:02:44,603
好了 女士们先生们 我们的会议正式开始
All right, ladies and gentlemen. This meeting will now come to order.

841
01:02:44,761 --> 01:02:47,935
各位 现在有一位非董事会成员坐在这里
I'd like to point out that we have a non-board member here...

842
01:02:48,098 --> 01:02:51,443
他不能参加会议 就算这栋楼上有他的名字
...which is highly irregular, even if his family name is above the door.

843
01:02:51,601 --> 01:02:53,854
布鲁斯・韦恩的家族创建了这公司
Bruce Wayne's family built this company.

844
01:02:54,020 --> 01:02:55,772
公司也是他经营的
And he himself has run it.

845
01:02:55,939 --> 01:02:58,095
经营到破产了 先生 我说错了吗 
Into the ground, sir! Does anybody disagree? 

846
01:02:58,095 --> 01:03:00,595
看看今天公司的股价
Check the share price this morning.

847
01:03:00,860 --> 01:03:05,115
他在期货市场里疯狂赌博 不能让赔掉了自己的公司
Crazy gambling on futures has not only cost Mr. Wayne his seat...

848
01:03:05,282 --> 01:03:07,580
还让我们一起跟着赔钱 
...it's cost us all a lot of money.

849
01:03:07,742 --> 01:03:09,585
他必须离开
And he has to go.

850
01:03:10,453 --> 01:03:12,455
他说的很有道理 韦恩先生
I'm afraid he has a point, Mr. Wayne.

851
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:22,553
我们说正事吧
Now, back to business.

852
01:03:23,258 --> 01:03:24,878
韦恩先生 看这边
Mr. Wayne, over here!

853
01:03:24,878 --> 01:03:26,478
普通人的感觉怎么样
How's it feel to be one of the people?

854
01:03:26,636 --> 01:03:28,686
韦恩先生 他们在拖你的车
Mr. Wayne, they're towing your car! I

855
01:03:28,686 --> 01:03:30,686
我不知道该怎么办
didn't know what to do, they had paperwork.

856
01:03:32,434 --> 01:03:34,152
看来你得搭车了
Looks like you need a ride, huh?

857
01:03:34,311 --> 01:03:36,530
搭我们的车吧
Wayne, we'll give you a ride!

858
01:03:36,688 --> 01:03:40,989
米兰达・泰特怎么会获得韦恩集团董事会支持的
How the hell did Miranda Tate get the inside track on the Wayne board?

859
01:03:41,151 --> 01:03:43,324
她去见过韦恩了 她跟韦恩上床了
She been meeting with him? Sleeping with him?

860
01:03:43,486 --> 01:03:44,856
据我所知 没有
Not that we know of.

861
01:03:44,856 --> 01:03:46,456
看来你的消息不够灵通啊 
You don't know much of anything, do you?

862
01:03:46,614 --> 01:03:47,537
贝恩人在哪儿
Where's Bane?

863
01:03:47,537 --> 01:03:48,537
我们已经请他过来了
We told him it was urgent.

864
01:03:48,700 --> 01:03:49,728
那家伙在哪儿
Where is that masked...?

865
01:03:49,728 --> 01:03:51,328
在找我吗 
Speak of the devil...

866
01:03:51,494 --> 01:03:53,747
我从不迟到
...and he shall appear.

867
01:03:53,913 --> 01:03:56,382
贝恩 告诉我 这是怎么回事
What the hell is going on?

868
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,379
一切都在按照我们的计划进行
The plan is proceeding as expected.

869
01:03:59,379 --> 01:04:00,379
是吗
Oh, really?

870
01:04:00,545 --> 01:04:03,344
那我现在怎么还没当上韦恩集团的老板呢
Do I look like I'm running Wayne Enterprises right now?

871
01:04:03,631 --> 01:04:08,182
你去打劫证券交易所 这根本不管用 我的朋友
Your hit on the stock exchange, it didn't work, my friend.

872
01:04:08,345 --> 01:04:13,476
现在你让我公司下面的施工队 一天24小时在全城四处开挖
And now you have my construction crews going around the city at 24 hours a day.

873
01:04:13,641 --> 01:04:18,568
你倒说说看 这些对我吞并韦恩集团有什么帮助
How exactly is that supposed to help my company absorb Wayne's?

874
01:04:21,149 --> 01:04:22,327
你出去
Leave us.

875
01:04:22,327 --> 01:04:23,527
不 你留下
No. You stay here.

876
01:04:23,693 --> 01:04:25,286
这里我说了算
I'm in charge.

877
01:04:26,071 --> 01:04:28,449
真的是你说了算吗
Do you feel in charge?

878
01:04:33,495 --> 01:04:35,247
我给了你不少钱
I've paid you a small fortune.

879
01:04:35,413 --> 01:04:38,383
给了钱 我就得听你的吗
And this gives you power over me?

880
01:04:38,958 --> 01:04:40,380
你想干嘛
What is this?

881
01:04:40,543 --> 01:04:45,515
你的钱 还有你的施工队 过去帮了大忙
Your money and infrastructure have been important...

882
01:04:45,882 --> 01:04:47,008
现在不用了
...till now.

883
01:04:47,509 --> 01:04:48,635
你到底是谁
What are you?

884
01:04:48,802 --> 01:04:50,645
我是哥谭的末日
I'm Gotham's reckoning.

885
01:04:50,804 --> 01:04:53,683
我来终结这个早就该毁灭的地方
Here to end the borrowed time you've all been living on.

886
01:04:55,725 --> 01:04:58,854
你真是太邪恶了
You're pure evil.

887
01:04:59,020 --> 01:05:01,318
我的存在是必要的
I'm necessary evil.

888
01:05:01,481 --> 01:05:03,404
不
No. No, no, no!

889
01:05:07,987 --> 01:05:10,456
为什么要戴面具
When you started, why the mask?

890
01:05:10,615 --> 01:05:11,889
为了保护我身边的人
To protect the people closest to me.

891
01:05:11,889 --> 01:05:13,289
可你一直独来独往
But you were a loner, right?

892
01:05:13,451 --> 01:05:14,580
没有家人
You didn't have any family?

893
01:05:14,580 --> 01:05:16,580
但总还有关心的人
There are always people you care about.

894
01:05:16,746 --> 01:05:20,671
失去了才知道有多重要
You just don't realize how much until they're gone.

895
01:05:21,084 --> 01:05:23,963
我觉得面具是一种象征
The idea was to be a symbol.

896
01:05:24,129 --> 01:05:27,258
谁都可以成为蝙蝠侠
Batman could be anybody.

897
01:05:27,799 --> 01:05:29,346
所以我戴面具
That was the point.

898
01:05:29,717 --> 01:05:31,937
很高兴他能回来 
Well, it was damn good to see him back.

899
01:05:31,937 --> 01:05:32,937
有些人可不这么想   
Not everybody agrees.

900
01:05:33,138 --> 01:05:34,359
他们最后会明白的
They'll figure that out in the end.

901
01:05:34,359 --> 01:05:37,359
你知道贝恩的下落了吗
You got anything on Bane's whereabouts?

902
01:05:37,892 --> 01:05:41,112
我有500页的下水道地图和一个手电筒
Yeah. I got 500 pages of tunnel records and a flashlight.

903
01:05:41,271 --> 01:05:43,365
其他人都不肯帮我
I could use some help, actually.

904
01:05:44,357 --> 01:05:46,234
好吧 送我去旧城区
You know what? Drop me in Old Town.

905
01:05:49,863 --> 01:05:51,456
嗨嗨嗨嗨 别这样
Hey, hey, hey. I don't think so!

906
01:05:51,614 --> 01:05:52,787
就要这么做
That's the way this works!

907
01:05:52,787 --> 01:05:53,787
别这样
I don't think so!

908
01:05:53,950 --> 01:05:56,203
- 就应该这样 - 他不是我们的目标
- That is the way... -  He's not a mark.

909
01:05:56,369 --> 01:05:59,043
再说他现在的钱包已经空了
And he doesn't have a cent to his name, anyway.

910
01:05:59,539 --> 01:06:03,840
是的 这里很朴素 不过比你现在住的地方强
Yeah, it's not much. But it's more than you've got right now.

911
01:06:04,002 --> 01:06:06,425
事实上 他们没没收我的房子
Actually, they're letting me keep the house.

912
01:06:06,588 --> 01:06:09,182
行了行了 你再落魄都比我强
The rich don't even go broke the same as the rest of us, huh?

913
01:06:09,340 --> 01:06:13,311
我那个很厉害的朋友 他想要说服你不要走
My powerful friend might hope to change your mind about leaving.

914
01:06:13,470 --> 01:06:14,698
他要怎么说服
And how would he do that?

915
01:06:14,698 --> 01:06:16,098
给你想要的东西
By giving you what you want.

916
01:06:16,264 --> 01:06:17,538
那东西根本不存在
It doesn't exist.

917
01:06:17,538 --> 01:06:18,738
他说存在
He says it does.

918
01:06:19,642 --> 01:06:21,360
他想见你 今晚
He wants to meet tonight.

919
01:06:21,519 --> 01:06:22,566
为什么
Why?

920
01:06:22,729 --> 01:06:25,653
我朋友想找到贝恩 你知道他在哪儿
He needs to find Bane. Says you'd know how.

921
01:06:28,985 --> 01:06:30,204
我会考虑的 
Tell him I'll think about it.

922
01:06:30,204 --> 01:06:31,204
好的
Okay.

923
01:06:31,362 --> 01:06:33,239
你的房子不错
I like your place.

924
01:06:34,699 --> 01:06:35,825
韦恩先生
Mr. Wayne?

925
01:06:38,453 --> 01:06:40,706
对不起 让你破产了
I'm sorry they took all your money.

926
01:06:41,789 --> 01:06:43,086
别装了
No, you're not.

927
01:06:44,209 --> 01:06:46,008
有事吗 警官
Can we help you, officer?

928
01:06:46,008 --> 01:06:47,008
是的
Uh, yeah.

929
01:06:47,170 --> 01:06:50,720
一小时前有人发现了一具尸体 是约翰・达盖特
John Daggett's body was just found in a Dumpster about an hour ago.

930
01:06:50,882 --> 01:06:51,950
你可能感兴趣
hought you might want to know.

931
01:06:51,950 --> 01:06:52,850
为什么
Why?

932
01:06:53,009 --> 01:06:57,139
哥谭市的地下工程许可证上 都是他的名字
His name's all over these permits I just pulled to, uh, map the tunnels under Gotham.

933
01:06:57,305 --> 01:07:01,185
其中包括 隧道工程 下水道建设 都和他有关
That's MTA maintenance, uh, sewer construction, couple of other things.

934
01:07:01,351 --> 01:07:04,355
你在下水道里有什么发现吗
Where did you get to with the tunnel searches?

935
01:07:04,521 --> 01:07:07,400
谁让你这个愣头青去搜查下水道的
Remind me to tell detail to keep hotheads out.

936
01:07:07,565 --> 01:07:09,738
我已经派人去了 工程浩大
We've had teams down there. It's a huge network.

937
01:07:09,901 --> 01:07:13,246
再多派点人去 仔细搜查 给我抓住他
Well, get more men. Work a grid. I want him found.

938
01:07:13,404 --> 01:07:15,748
对 那个戴面具的人 会找到的 
Yeah, the, uh, masked man. We're on it.

939
01:07:15,907 --> 01:07:18,660
把制服脱了 你现在归我管
Lose the uniform, you're working for me now.

940
01:07:18,826 --> 01:07:21,249
我觉得这种愣头青没什么不好
We could use some hotter heads around here.

941
01:07:21,412 --> 01:07:23,542
这也可能只是个巧合
Sir, that could also be a coincidence.

942
01:07:23,542 --> 01:07:25,542
你现在是警探了
You're a detective now, son.

943
01:07:25,708 --> 01:07:28,837
不能再相信天底下有什么巧合了
You're not allowed to believe in coincidence any more.

944
01:07:32,837 --> 01:07:35,837
本字幕由无聊老生诚意制作

945
01:07:40,014 --> 01:07:41,561
没人来开门呐 
Nobody's answering.

946
01:07:41,933 --> 01:07:43,105
是啊
No.

947
01:07:43,268 --> 01:07:44,941
我现在一个人住
I'm on my own now.

948
01:07:45,770 --> 01:07:47,192
你有钥匙吗
Do you have keys?

949
01:07:48,398 --> 01:07:49,570
从来没用过
Never needed them.

950
01:07:56,239 --> 01:07:57,991
希望你爱上的不是我的钱
Hope you didn't like me for my money.

951
01:07:58,741 --> 01:08:01,335
苦难能磨炼出意志
Suffering builds character.

952
01:08:07,375 --> 01:08:09,924
我会替你照看好你父母的公司
I'll take care of your parents' legacy, Bruce.

953
01:08:12,088 --> 01:08:13,431
这是谁
Who's this?

954
01:08:21,264 --> 01:08:22,607
阿尔弗雷德呢
Where's Alfred?

955
01:08:24,392 --> 01:08:25,769
他走了
He left...

956
01:08:27,437 --> 01:08:29,405
不会回来了
...taking everything.

957
01:08:53,379 --> 01:08:54,756
怎么回事
What's that?

958
01:08:55,548 --> 01:08:57,846
他们把我的电也给断了
My power's been shut off.

959
01:09:03,348 --> 01:09:04,816
你还会生火
You're good at that.

960
01:09:05,933 --> 01:09:08,857
我小的时候家里什么都没有
When I was a child, we had almost nothing.

961
01:09:09,312 --> 01:09:13,818
到了晚上点上一盆火 我们就感到很富有很满足
But on the nights when we had a fire, we felt very rich indeed.

962
01:09:15,652 --> 01:09:18,622
我还以为你家一直很有钱
I assumed your family was wealthy.

963
01:09:19,405 --> 01:09:20,907
后来才有钱 
Not always.

964
01:09:21,908 --> 01:09:23,455
小的时候家里很穷
Not when I was young.

965
01:09:24,118 --> 01:09:25,961
以前犯过错
An old mistake.

966
01:09:27,080 --> 01:09:28,957
我也犯了一些错
I've made a few myself.

967
01:09:30,208 --> 01:09:31,835
岂止是一些
More than a few.

968
01:09:34,087 --> 01:09:35,589
我们可以离开 
We could leave.

969
01:09:36,089 --> 01:09:37,136
今晚就走
Tonight.

970
01:09:38,007 --> 01:09:42,057
搭我的飞机 想去哪儿都行
Take my plane, go anywhere we wanted.

971
01:09:43,846 --> 01:09:45,644
改天或许可以 
Someday, perhaps.

972
01:09:46,599 --> 01:09:48,067
今晚不行
Not tonight.

973
01:10:16,254 --> 01:10:18,097
别害羞啊
Don't be shy.

974
01:10:20,258 --> 01:10:22,681
韦恩说你能给我清除程序
Wayne says you can get me the clean slate.

975
01:10:23,010 --> 01:10:24,363
要看情况
That depends.

976
01:10:24,363 --> 01:10:25,663
什么情况
On what?

977
01:10:25,930 --> 01:10:27,557
看你要它干嘛
On what you want it for.

978
01:10:27,724 --> 01:10:30,648
我不希望它落到坏人手里
I acquired it to keep it out of the wrong hands.

979
01:10:31,436 --> 01:10:33,188
还是不相信我啊
Still don't trust me, huh?

980
01:10:34,313 --> 01:10:36,361
你想要我怎么做呢
How can we change that?

981
01:10:36,524 --> 01:10:38,322
你可以带我去见贝恩
Start by taking me to Bane.

982
01:10:41,362 --> 01:10:42,955
后果自负
You asked.

983
01:10:45,241 --> 01:10:47,289
从这儿开始 就有他的人巡逻
From here, Bane's men patrol the tunnels.

984
01:10:47,618 --> 01:10:50,087
这些人可不是好惹的
And they're not your average brawlers.

985
01:10:50,580 --> 01:10:52,082
我也是
Neither am I.

986
01:10:59,881 --> 01:11:00,973
- 他在你背后 - 谁
- He's behind you. - Who?

987
01:11:01,132 --> 01:11:02,179
我
Me.

988
01:11:07,346 --> 01:11:09,314
你以为自己是谁
What do you think you're...?

989
01:11:21,444 --> 01:11:23,663
还要再往前走
Just a little further.

990
01:11:30,870 --> 01:11:33,419
不这么做 他们就会杀了我
I had to find a way to stop them trying to kill me.

991
01:11:33,581 --> 01:11:36,004
你犯了一个大错
You made a serious mistake.

992
01:11:36,584 --> 01:11:41,511
再大也没有你犯的错大 真遗憾
Not as serious as yours, I fear.

993
01:11:45,176 --> 01:11:46,223
贝恩
Bane.

994
01:11:46,385 --> 01:11:49,480
到了我这儿就不用这么拘束了
Let's not stand on ceremony here...

995
01:11:50,723 --> 01:11:53,067
韦恩先生
...Mr. Wayne.

996
01:12:04,278 --> 01:12:06,451
你一直都依赖这些装备
Peace has cost you your strength.

997
01:12:06,614 --> 01:12:08,457
自身的技艺都生疏了
Victory has defeated you.

998
01:13:10,219 --> 01:13:15,851
戏剧性的小玩意儿和障眼法 只能骗骗没有见过世面的外行人
Theatricality and deception, powerful agents to the uninitiated.

999
01:13:16,017 --> 01:13:18,816
我们不是普通人 对不对 布鲁斯
But we are initiated, aren't we, Bruce?

1000
01:13:19,729 --> 01:13:22,573
我们都是影武者联盟的
Members of the League of Shadows.

1001
01:13:24,567 --> 01:13:26,945
而你背叛了我们
And you betrayed us.

1002
01:13:27,778 --> 01:13:30,702
我们 你是被开除的
"Us"? You were excommunicated...

1003
01:13:30,865 --> 01:13:33,414
跟一群丧心病狂的疯子
...by a gang of psychopaths.

1004
01:13:37,872 --> 01:13:40,796
我就是影武者联盟
I am the League of Shadows.

1005
01:13:40,958 --> 01:13:44,087
我来这儿 就是为了完成忍者大师的使命
And I'm here to fulfill Ra's Al Ghul's destiny.

1006
01:13:57,642 --> 01:13:59,736
你打起架来像个年轻人 
You fight like a younger man.

1007
01:13:59,894 --> 01:14:02,192
不给自己留后路
Nothing held back.

1008
01:14:02,355 --> 01:14:05,575
全力出击 所以漏洞百出
Admirable, but mistaken.

1009
01:14:08,986 --> 01:14:13,583
哦 你以为黑暗会帮助你吗
Oh, you think darkness is your ally?

1010
01:14:13,741 --> 01:14:16,460
你不过是躲在黑暗里 
But you merely adopted the dark.

1011
01:14:17,119 --> 01:14:19,167
而我是生在黑暗里
I was born in it.

1012
01:14:19,747 --> 01:14:21,875
它造就了我
Molded by it.

1013
01:14:23,042 --> 01:14:26,137
我成人之后才第一次见到阳光
I didn't see the light until I was already a man.

1014
01:14:26,295 --> 01:14:29,549
那时候我只觉得阳光很刺眼
By then, it was nothing to me but blinding!

1015
01:14:32,551 --> 01:14:36,522
黑暗背弃了你 因为它属于我
The shadows betray you because they belong to me!

1016
01:14:41,894 --> 01:14:45,114
我要让你看看 我在为伸张正义做准备时待的地方
I will show you where I have made my home...

1017
01:14:45,272 --> 01:14:48,617
那里曾是我的家 
...whilst preparing to bring justice.

1018
01:14:50,820 --> 01:14:53,039
然后 我会摧毁你  
Then I will break you.

1019
01:15:01,789 --> 01:15:03,666
你的宝贝军械库
Your precious armory.

1020
01:15:04,333 --> 01:15:07,678
能帮我们大忙 我们笑纳了
Gratefully accepted. We will need it.

1021
01:15:16,387 --> 01:15:20,187
哦 对了 我还在想 哪个会先崩溃
Ah, yes. I was wondering what would break first.

1022
01:15:24,937 --> 01:15:26,735
是你的精神
Your spirit...

1023
01:15:31,152 --> 01:15:32,870
还是你的身体
...or your body.

1024
01:16:16,864 --> 01:16:19,993
帮我接高顿局长 我有议员绑架案的线索
Get me Commissioner Gordon. I got a line on the congressman's kidnapping.

1025
01:16:33,089 --> 01:16:34,261
- 对不起 小姐 - 怎么了
- Excuse me, miss. - Uh, yes?

1026
01:16:34,423 --> 01:16:37,597
麻烦您出示一下您的机票和身份证件
I'm gonna need to see your ticket and identification, please.

1027
01:16:37,760 --> 01:16:39,808
帮我拿一下
Oh. Do you mind?

1028
01:16:52,608 --> 01:16:55,737
我把你的照片给议员看 你猜怎么样
I showed your picture to the congressman. Guess what.

1029
01:16:56,028 --> 01:16:58,577
别告诉我 他还想着我
Don't tell me. Still in love?

1030
01:16:58,739 --> 01:17:01,288
做梦都想着你 他要起诉你
Oh, head over heels. Pressing charges, though.

1031
01:17:02,326 --> 01:17:05,205
你做错了一些事 凯尔小姐
You've made some mistakes, Ms. Kyle.

1032
01:17:06,163 --> 01:17:07,337
我总得混口饭吃
Girl's gotta eat.

1033
01:17:07,337 --> 01:17:08,837
你的胃口还挺大
And you have an appetite.

1034
01:17:09,667 --> 01:17:11,920
干嘛逃跑 凭你的记录躲不开警察
Why would you run? You can't hide with a record like this.

1035
01:17:12,086 --> 01:17:14,134
或许我要躲的不是警察
Maybe it's not you I'm running from.

1036
01:17:14,296 --> 01:17:16,173
那是谁 贝恩吗
Who then? Bane?

1037
01:17:16,340 --> 01:17:17,808
你知道些什么
What do you know about him?

1038
01:17:18,843 --> 01:17:22,313
我只知道 你应该像我一样害怕他
That you should be as afraid of him as I am.

1039
01:17:22,471 --> 01:17:24,348
我们能保护你
We can offer you protection.

1040
01:17:27,643 --> 01:17:28,690
好吧
Okay.

1041
01:17:33,357 --> 01:17:36,861
我来找你是为了我的朋友 布鲁斯・韦恩
When I spotted you, I was looking for a friend of mine. Bruce Wayne.

1042
01:17:39,738 --> 01:17:41,240
他还活着吗
Did they kill him?

1043
01:17:42,992 --> 01:17:44,619
我不确定
I'm not sure.

1044
01:18:04,430 --> 01:18:06,057
你干嘛不直接
Why didn't you just...

1045
01:18:08,058 --> 01:18:09,230
杀了我
...kill me?

1046
01:18:09,393 --> 01:18:12,863
你不害怕死亡 你求之不得
You don't fear death, you welcome it.

1047
01:18:13,397 --> 01:18:16,150
我得给你更残酷的惩罚
Your punishment must be more severe.

1048
01:18:16,901 --> 01:18:18,494
你要折磨我
Torture?

1049
01:18:18,819 --> 01:18:19,911
对
Yes.

1050
01:18:20,863 --> 01:18:22,740
不是你的身体
But not of your body.

1051
01:18:26,410 --> 01:18:27,878
而是你的灵魂
Of your soul.

1052
01:18:29,330 --> 01:18:30,456
我在哪儿
Where am I?

1053
01:18:30,998 --> 01:18:32,045
家里
Home.

1054
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:35,924
我在这里懂得了什么是绝望 
Where I learned the truth about despair.

1055
01:18:36,921 --> 01:18:38,264
你也会的
As will you.

1056
01:18:38,881 --> 01:18:42,476
这里之所以成为世界上最可怕的地方 是因为
There is a reason why this prison is the worst hell on earth:

1057
01:18:43,260 --> 01:18:44,637
希望
Hope.

1058
01:18:44,803 --> 01:18:47,932
几百年来关在这里的囚犯们
Every man who has rotted here over the centuries...

1059
01:18:48,098 --> 01:18:51,523
抬头看到光 就梦想着爬出去获得自由
...has looked up to the light and imagined climbing to freedom.

1060
01:18:52,603 --> 01:18:53,946
这看上去
So easy.

1061
01:18:54,855 --> 01:18:56,107
很容易
So simple.

1062
01:18:57,066 --> 01:19:02,664
就像那些遇到海难的人因为无法忍受口渴而去喝海水
And like shipwrecked men turning to seawater from uncontrollable thirst...

1063
01:19:04,740 --> 01:19:06,708
这些尝试换来了死亡
...many have died trying.

1064
01:19:07,576 --> 01:19:11,297
在这儿我明白了没有希望就没有真正的绝望
I learned here there can be no true despair without hope.

1065
01:19:13,165 --> 01:19:15,839
所以我不会马上毁掉哥谭市
So as I terrorize Gotham...

1066
01:19:16,001 --> 01:19:19,972
我要用希望毒死那些人的灵魂
...I will feed its people hope to poison their souls.

1067
01:19:20,381 --> 01:19:22,930
我会给他们希望 让他们以为自己会幸存
will let them believe that they can survive...

1068
01:19:23,092 --> 01:19:29,065
然后你就会看到 他们为了活命自相残杀
...so that you can watch them clambering over each other to stay in the sun.

1069
01:19:31,892 --> 01:19:35,021
我要让你看着我蹂躏这个城市
You can watch me torture an entire city.

1070
01:19:35,688 --> 01:19:39,318
让你真正意识到 你的失败有多彻底
And then when you have truly understood the depth of your failure...

1071
01:19:39,608 --> 01:19:42,578
我们要完成忍者大师的使命
...we will fulfill Ra's Al Ghul's destiny.

1072
01:19:46,240 --> 01:19:48,163
毁灭哥谭市
We will destroy Gotham.

1073
01:19:49,451 --> 01:19:51,920
然后 当使命完成
And then, when it is done...

1074
01:19:52,371 --> 01:19:53,998
当哥谭市成为
...and Gotham is...

1075
01:19:55,833 --> 01:19:57,210
灰烬
...ashes...

1076
01:20:02,881 --> 01:20:05,634
那个时候 我才会让你死
...then you have my permission to die.

1077
01:20:19,940 --> 01:20:21,442
你要把她关在这儿
You're looking her up in here?

1078
01:20:21,608 --> 01:20:25,454
丹特法案规定在必要的时候我们可以这么做
The Dent Act allows non-segregation based on extraordinary need.

1079
01:20:25,612 --> 01:20:28,707
她第一次逃出女子监狱时才16岁
First time she broke out of women's correctional, she was 16.

1080
01:20:28,866 --> 01:20:30,038
她不会有事的
Little closer, baby.

1081
01:20:30,200 --> 01:20:32,294
宝贝 怎么了 宝贝 想牵我手吗
Why, honey? You wanna hold my hand?

1082
01:20:33,662 --> 01:20:35,380
布鲁斯的很多想法都对
She's gonna be fine.

1083
01:20:36,248 --> 01:20:39,422
我觉得没必要为能源项目专门召开董事会
I still don't see the need of a board meeting for the energy project.

1084
01:20:39,585 --> 01:20:41,178
布鲁斯的很多想法都对
Bruce got a lot of things right.

1085
01:20:41,337 --> 01:20:43,840
但我不赞成对董事会隐瞒这个项目
Keeping the board in the dark was not one of them.

1086
01:20:46,425 --> 01:20:47,893
欢迎两位大驾光临
How good of you to join us.

1087
01:20:48,594 --> 01:20:51,222
主席 董事长
Chair. President.

1088
01:20:51,388 --> 01:20:55,063
我们现在还缺少一位董事会的普通成员
All I need now is one more ordinary board member.

1089
01:20:55,225 --> 01:20:58,650
福克斯先生 你有推荐的人选吗 
Mr. Fox, would you like to nominate?

1090
01:20:58,812 --> 01:21:00,064
不用了 
No.

1091
01:21:00,230 --> 01:21:01,732
我自愿参加
I will volunteer.

1092
01:21:02,149 --> 01:21:03,822
你要带我们去哪儿
Where are you taking us?

1093
01:21:14,453 --> 01:21:17,297
你是对的 局长  请让我们单独待一会儿
You were right, commissioner. Will you excuse us, please?

1094
01:21:17,623 --> 01:21:18,670
怎么了
What happened?

1095
01:21:18,832 --> 01:21:20,960
那家伙绑架了韦恩集团的董事会成员
Your masked man kidnapped the Wayne Enterprises board.

1096
01:21:21,126 --> 01:21:24,050
他放了其他人 但挟持了三个进了下水道
He let most of them go, but he took three into the sewers.

1097
01:21:24,213 --> 01:21:26,557
别再巡逻了 也别再派人搜查了
No more patrols. No more hide and seek.

1098
01:21:26,715 --> 01:21:29,434
召集所有警察 下去把他抓出来
Get every available cop down there and smoke him out!

1099
01:21:29,593 --> 01:21:31,140
市长不想引起骚乱
The mayor won't want panic.

1100
01:21:31,303 --> 01:21:33,476
对外就说 这是个演习
So it's a training exercise.

1101
01:21:35,891 --> 01:21:38,314
抱歉 我一开始没想起你
I'm sorry I didn't take you seriously.

1102
01:21:39,103 --> 01:21:40,150
你别走 
Not you.

1103
01:21:40,312 --> 01:21:42,690
你说蝙蝠侠不见了
You're telling me the Batman's gone...

1104
01:21:42,856 --> 01:21:47,578
我要你去追查达盖特案 查出他想干什么
...so you chase up the Daggett leads any way you can.

1105
01:21:47,903 --> 01:21:48,950
是
Yes, sir.

1106
01:21:59,373 --> 01:22:04,846
他问你 愿意付多少钱让我们杀了你
He asks how much you would pay us to let you die.

1107
01:22:05,003 --> 01:22:07,005
我跟他说 你一分钱也没有
I told him. I told him you have nothing.

1108
01:22:07,756 --> 01:22:09,008
就当是消遣吧
Do it for the pleasure.

1109
01:22:09,508 --> 01:22:12,478
他们付了我很多钱 让我确保你活着
They pay me more than that to keep you alive.

1110
01:22:20,269 --> 01:22:22,112
又有人想爬出去
He will try the climb.

1111
01:22:36,577 --> 01:22:39,046
以前有人成功过吗
Has anyone ever made it?

1112
01:22:39,955 --> 01:22:41,423
当然没有了
Of course not.

1113
01:22:51,925 --> 01:22:54,303
他说有一个人成功过
He says there is one who did.

1114
01:22:55,220 --> 01:22:56,813
一个孩子
A child.

1115
01:22:58,056 --> 01:23:00,104
他出生在这个监狱里
A child born in this hell.

1116
01:23:01,018 --> 01:23:02,611
贝恩
Bane.

1117
01:23:02,811 --> 01:23:05,906
只是个传说 未必是真的
An old legend. Nothing more.

1118
01:23:09,693 --> 01:23:10,865
不要
Don't.

1119
01:23:11,028 --> 01:23:15,408
那些人想让你看的事情 就要发生了
Whatever it is they want you to see, it's happening soon.

1120
01:23:41,058 --> 01:23:42,810
小心手雷
Fire in the hole!

1121
01:24:11,547 --> 01:24:13,049
启动反应堆
Turn it on.

1122
01:24:16,760 --> 01:24:21,607
只要一个董事的指纹就行了 你不肯干还有八个候补的
I only need one other board member. There are eight others waiting.

1123
01:24:21,765 --> 01:24:23,233
我不会开的
I won't do it.

1124
01:24:23,725 --> 01:24:24,772
行了 别开枪
All right, stop.

1125
01:24:26,311 --> 01:24:29,235
卢修斯 他们会杀了他 也会杀了你 
you'll kill this man, and yourself...

1126
01:24:29,398 --> 01:24:31,196
你是阻止不了他们的
...and you'll barely slow them down.

1127
01:24:57,801 --> 01:25:00,020
快去吧 做你该做的事
Go on, then. Do your work.

1128
01:25:03,015 --> 01:25:05,143
把他们带到地面上去
Take them up to the surface.

1129
01:25:05,309 --> 01:25:07,186
像他们这种身份地位的人
People of their status...

1130
01:25:07,352 --> 01:25:12,609
应该亲眼目睹 下一个西方文明时代的到来
...deserve to experience the next era of western civilization.

1131
01:25:16,612 --> 01:25:20,742
我去了达盖特一半的水泥厂 记下了他们参与的地下工程地点
 I've been to half of Daggett's cement plants and locations they poured underground. 

1132
01:25:20,907 --> 01:25:23,285
有什么奇怪的地方吗
Anything strange about the pourings?

1133
01:25:23,827 --> 01:25:27,252
老实说 局长 我对市政工程一窍不通
Honestly, commissioner, I don't know anything about civil engineering.

1134
01:25:27,414 --> 01:25:30,338
可你了解犯罪手法 继续查
But you know about patterns. Keep looking.

1135
01:25:35,756 --> 01:25:36,882
成功了
It's done.

1136
01:25:37,049 --> 01:25:41,395
成功了 它的威力相当于4百万吨级的核弹
This is now a 4-megaton nuclear bomb.

1137
01:25:42,638 --> 01:25:45,391
把核心从反应堆里拿出来
Pull the core out of the reactor.

1138
01:25:46,933 --> 01:25:48,810
不 不能这么做
No, you cannot.

1139
01:25:49,144 --> 01:25:52,819
核心只有在反应堆里才能保持稳定
This is the only power source capable of sustaining it.

1140
01:25:53,231 --> 01:25:57,077
一旦拿出来 核心在几个月里就会衰变
If you move it, the core will decay in a matter of months.

1141
01:25:57,235 --> 01:25:59,408
我估计大概要五个月吧
Five, by my calculations.

1142
01:25:59,571 --> 01:26:01,244
然后它会爆炸的
And then it will go off!

1143
01:26:03,033 --> 01:26:07,004
为你的孩子们着想 帕沃博士
And for the sake of your children, Dr. Pavel...

1144
01:26:07,162 --> 01:26:09,415
我希望它会爆炸
...indeed I hope it does.

1145
01:26:10,082 --> 01:26:12,756
嗨 嗨
Hey. Hey!

1146
01:26:14,711 --> 01:26:17,840
那天在证券交易所门口的 就是你
That was you in front of the stock exchange, wasn't it?

1147
01:26:18,465 --> 01:26:20,138
- 哪天 - 哪天
- When? - When?

1148
01:26:20,300 --> 01:26:24,601
那天全城一半的警察要去凯斯特街 你偏偏把路给挡了
When cops were trying to pull onto Castle Street and your truck was shutting them out.

1149
01:26:24,763 --> 01:26:27,313
哦 对 你是那警察
Oh, yeah. You're the cop.

1150
01:26:27,313 --> 01:26:28,313
现在是警探
Detective now.

1151
01:26:28,475 --> 01:26:32,480
作为一名警探 我不相信世上有什么巧合
And, uh, as a detective, we're not allowed to believe in coincidence.

1152
01:26:42,239 --> 01:26:45,243
你在这儿干嘛 你在做什么
What were you doing here? What are you working on?

1153
01:26:52,749 --> 01:26:54,296
局长 我是布雷克 
Commissioner, it's Blake.

1154
01:26:54,459 --> 01:26:59,010
我有两个死掉的证人和一大堆疑问 给我回电
I got two dead witnesses and a lot of questions. Call me whenev...

1155
01:26:59,423 --> 01:27:02,768
等一下 我看到这里有四桶聚异丁烯
Wait a minute. I'm looking at four barrels of polyisobutylene.

1156
01:27:04,553 --> 01:27:06,806
旁边的看起来像是机油
That looks like motor oil right next to it.

1157
01:27:06,972 --> 01:27:10,192
天呐 他们做的不是水泥 是炸药
Jesus, they're not making cement. They're making explosives.

1158
01:27:17,899 --> 01:27:19,052
帮我接弗利
Patch me in to Foley.

1159
01:27:19,052 --> 01:27:20,552
弗利在指挥行动
Foley's overseeing the operation.

1160
01:27:20,819 --> 01:27:22,162
那是一个陷阱 
They're heading into a trap!

1161
01:27:23,405 --> 01:27:26,033
我们看见几千名警察进入下水道
We're seeing thousands of police heading into the sewers.

1162
01:27:26,199 --> 01:27:27,769
市长先生 为什么这么多警察
Mr. Mayor? Literally thousands.

1163
01:27:27,769 --> 01:27:29,569
只是一次演习 没什么 抱歉 失陪了
It's a training exercise, that's all.

1164
01:27:29,828 --> 01:27:33,878
我要去看哥谭队和拉皮德城队的比赛 失陪
Now if you'll excuse me, I've got tickets to watch our boys thrash Rapid City.

1165
01:27:35,792 --> 01:27:36,794
我是弗利
Foley

1166
01:27:36,794 --> 01:27:37,794
那是个陷阱 快让大家出来
It's a trap! Pull everyone out!

1167
01:27:37,961 --> 01:27:40,508
贝恩在混凝土里加了炸药
Bane has been pouring concrete laced with explosives!

1168
01:27:40,671 --> 01:27:41,639
在哪儿
Where?

1169
01:27:43,884 --> 01:27:51,393
地道周围装满了炸药
Oh, say, can you see By the dawn's early light

1170
01:27:52,267 --> 01:27:57,945
你可看见 透过一线曙光
What so proudly we hailed At the twilight's...

1171
01:27:58,273 --> 01:28:02,028
他们要引爆炸药 把警察都困在下面
There's a ring around the tunnels! They'll blow it and trap the cops underground! 

1172
01:28:03,111 --> 01:28:05,955
全体撤退 撤退 快
Pull them out. Pull them out now!

1173
01:28:06,114 --> 01:28:10,210
谁的横条星星 冒着一夜炮火
Through the perilous fight

1174
01:28:10,702 --> 01:28:14,502
 依然迎风招展 
O'er the ramparts we watched

1175
01:28:15,040 --> 01:28:19,090
在我军碉堡上
Were so gallantly streaming

1176
01:28:19,544 --> 01:28:23,299
火炮闪闪发光 
And the rockets' red glare

1177
01:28:23,965 --> 01:28:27,720
炸弹轰轰作响 
The bombs bursting in air

1178
01:28:28,261 --> 01:28:29,979
它们都是见证 
Gave proof through...

1179
01:28:30,180 --> 01:28:32,353
这声音真是太动听了
That's a lovely, lovely voice.

1180
01:28:32,516 --> 01:28:36,646
国旗安然无恙... 
that our flag was still there

1181
01:28:37,437 --> 01:28:45,437
你看星条旗不是还高高飘扬
Oh, say does that star-spangled banner Yet wave 

1182
01:28:47,656 --> 01:28:52,708
在这自由国家
O'er the land of the free

1183
01:28:53,620 --> 01:28:59,718
勇士的家乡
And the home of the brave

1184
01:29:13,139 --> 01:29:14,937
游戏可以开始了
Let the games begin.

1185
01:30:31,384 --> 01:30:33,307
大家没事吧
Everybody okay?

1186
01:30:34,137 --> 01:30:35,980
- 快闪开 快 快 - 快 快
- Let's move! Move, move! - Go, go!

1187
01:30:49,986 --> 01:30:51,488
哥谭
Gotham...

1188
01:30:53,281 --> 01:30:55,454
今天是主场
...take control.

1189
01:30:56,201 --> 01:30:59,626
来掌控你们的城市吧
Take control of your city.

1190
01:31:04,834 --> 01:31:05,711
弗利
Foley.

1191
01:31:05,711 --> 01:31:06,711
见鬼 布雷克
Jesus, Blake.

1192
01:31:06,878 --> 01:31:08,801
所有的警察都困在地道里了
Every cop in the city's in those tunnels.

1193
01:31:09,881 --> 01:31:11,258
不是所有警察
Not every cop.

1194
01:31:25,313 --> 01:31:28,408
抱歉 你没事吧 我是警察 我要征用你的车
Sir, are you okay? I'm a police officer. I need your car right now.

1195
01:32:19,534 --> 01:32:21,536
你来开道 菜鸟
Clear the corners, rookie.

1196
01:32:22,662 --> 01:32:23,914
拿上我的外套
Get my coat, son.

1197
01:32:24,080 --> 01:32:25,832
这个
This...

1198
01:32:26,791 --> 01:32:29,795
这个东西是解放你们的工具
This is the instrument of your liberation.

1199
01:32:32,464 --> 01:32:35,308
辐射在增强
Satellite shows a radiation spike.

1200
01:32:36,134 --> 01:32:38,432
那东西肯定是核武器
Whatever it is, it's nuclear.

1201
01:32:42,891 --> 01:32:46,145
大声告诉全世界你是谁
Identify yourself to the world.

1202
01:32:47,479 --> 01:32:51,905
利奥尼德?帕沃博士 核物理学家
Dr. Leonid Pavel, nuclear physicist.

1203
01:32:52,275 --> 01:32:54,619
帕沃被证实已经死了
Pavel was confirmed dead.

1204
01:32:54,778 --> 01:32:58,328
在乌兹别克斯坦的救援行动中坠机身亡
Plane crash on an agency pull out of Uzbekistan, but...

1205
01:32:59,324 --> 01:33:00,450
可是 这的确是他
It looks like it's him.

1206
01:33:00,742 --> 01:33:03,996
还有这个 这是什么
And what...? What is this?

1207
01:33:04,162 --> 01:33:08,042
这是一个安装完成的中子弹 
It's a fully primed neutron bomb...

1208
01:33:08,208 --> 01:33:10,586
爆炸半径达到六英里
...with a blast radius of six miles.

1209
01:33:11,419 --> 01:33:14,798
告诉我 谁能拆除这个爆炸装置
And who is capable of disarming such a device?

1210
01:33:16,883 --> 01:33:18,180
只有我
Only me.

1211
01:33:18,927 --> 01:33:20,554
只有你
Only you.

1212
01:33:21,554 --> 01:33:23,852
谢谢 帕沃博士
Thank you, good doctor!

1213
01:33:26,434 --> 01:33:29,734
现在 炸弹已经装好了
Now, this bomb is armed!

1214
01:33:29,896 --> 01:33:32,490
而且这个炸弹会移动
And this bomb is mobile!

1215
01:33:32,649 --> 01:33:37,200
没有人知道炸弹的引爆器在谁手上
And the identity of the triggerman is a mystery.

1216
01:33:37,737 --> 01:33:42,584
因为这个人就在你们当中
For one of you holds the detonator!

1217
01:33:43,007 --> 01:33:46,386
我们来这里不是为了征服 
Now, we come here not as conquerors...

1218
01:33:46,552 --> 01:33:52,150
而是为了解放 我们要把这个城市的控制权还给市民
...but as liberators, to return control of this city to the people.

1219
01:33:53,351 --> 01:33:58,073
一旦我们发现有任何外来干预的迹象
And at the first sign of interference from the outside world...

1220
01:33:58,773 --> 01:34:02,573
或是发现你们当中的某些人企图逃跑
...or from those people attempting to flee...

1221
01:34:04,487 --> 01:34:07,115
那这位哥谭市民
...this anonymous Gothamite...

1222
01:34:07,281 --> 01:34:12,162
这位无名英雄就会引爆炸弹
...this unsung hero, will trigger the bomb.

1223
01:34:14,580 --> 01:34:16,958
现在开始实施戒严令
For now, martial law is in effect. 

1224
01:34:17,667 --> 01:34:22,468
请回到家里 抱着你的家人
Return to your homes, hold your families close...

1225
01:34:23,756 --> 01:34:25,178
耐心等待
...and wait.

1226
01:34:26,300 --> 01:34:29,349
明天一切就会见分晓
Tomorrow, you claim what is rightfully yours.

1227
01:34:35,643 --> 01:34:37,270
让战斗机返航 
Pull back the fighters.

1228
01:34:38,104 --> 01:34:40,698
立刻派几架侦察机过去
Start high-level reconnaissance flights.

1229
01:34:41,649 --> 01:34:43,447
帮我接总统
Get the president on the line.

1230
01:35:03,963 --> 01:35:08,594
用坦克和飞机是阻止不了我们引爆炸弹的
Tanks and planes cannot stop us from detonating our device.

1231
01:35:09,051 --> 01:35:14,353
你们不如派个特使来谈谈 获取物资和通讯的条件
Send an emissary to discuss terms of access for supplies and communication.

1232
01:35:19,228 --> 01:35:21,322
你们总共有多少人
How many of you are there, son?

1233
01:35:22,940 --> 01:35:26,740
你们不可能阻止1千2百万人离开那个岛
You don't have enough men to stop 12 million people from leaving this island.

1234
01:35:27,528 --> 01:35:29,951
对 我们是不能 
No. No, we don't.

1235
01:35:30,114 --> 01:35:31,161
但你们可以
But you do.

1236
01:35:32,909 --> 01:35:36,163
我怎么可能会帮你们留住这些人质呢
Now, why the hell would I try to help you keep your hostages?

1237
01:35:36,329 --> 01:35:39,333
只要有一个人过了这座桥 
If one person crosses this bridge...

1238
01:35:39,499 --> 01:35:41,297
哥谭就会化为灰烬
...Gotham gets blown to hell.

1239
01:35:47,215 --> 01:35:50,014
这个伟大城市的居民都很坚强
The people of our greatest city are resilient. 

1240
01:35:51,093 --> 01:35:54,643
他们曾经证明过这一点 将来还会再证明
They have proven this before, and they will prove it again. 

1241
01:35:56,599 --> 01:35:59,603
我们绝对不会向犯罪分子妥协
We do not negotiate with terrorists... 

1242
01:36:00,478 --> 01:36:02,321
当然我们也承认现实
...but we do recognize realities. 

1243
01:36:03,397 --> 01:36:05,525
局势会不断变化
As this situation develops... 

1244
01:36:06,025 --> 01:36:09,199
但我希望大家记住一件事情
...one thing must be understood above all others. 

1245
01:36:11,364 --> 01:36:14,288
哥谭市的市民 我们没有放弃你们
People of Gotham, we have not abandoned you. 

1246
01:36:14,450 --> 01:36:15,793
这是什么意思
What does that mean?

1247
01:36:16,410 --> 01:36:18,708
意思是他们帮不了我们
It means we're on our own.

1248
01:36:19,205 --> 01:36:20,923
我得想办法上电视
I have to get in front of a camera.

1249
01:36:21,374 --> 01:36:23,627
长官 你一出现他们就会杀了你
They will kill you the second you show your face.

1250
01:36:24,377 --> 01:36:26,257
贝恩说 要把哥谭还给市民
Bane says he's giving Gotham back to the people.

1251
01:36:26,257 --> 01:36:28,057
要让大家知道 我能带领他们
They need to know I could lead.

1252
01:36:28,422 --> 01:36:30,015
贝恩不会让你这么做的
Bane's not gonna let that happen.

1253
01:36:30,174 --> 01:36:31,721
那他就会露出真面目
Then he'll show his true colors.

1254
01:36:31,884 --> 01:36:33,511
他会杀了你
And you'll be dead.

1255
01:36:52,154 --> 01:36:57,251
在你们身后 是一个压迫的象征
Behind you stands a symbol of oppression.

1256
01:36:57,868 --> 01:36:59,336
黑门监狱 
Blackgate Prison...

1257
01:36:59,495 --> 01:37:03,090
一千多个人
...where a thousand men have languished...

1258
01:37:03,249 --> 01:37:06,753
因为一个人的缘故失去了自由 这个人他就是
...under the name of this man:

1259
01:37:06,919 --> 01:37:09,013
哈维?丹特
Harvey Dent.

1260
01:37:09,755 --> 01:37:12,349
在你们的城市里 
Who has been held up to you...

1261
01:37:12,508 --> 01:37:17,014
这个人受到大家的敬仰  被尊为正义的化身
...as the shining example of justice! 

1262
01:37:17,179 --> 01:37:20,183
我们会一直走 直到挤到镜头前为止
We're just gonna keep moving you till we can get you in front of the camera.

1263
01:37:20,349 --> 01:37:24,320
这是官方造出来的假英雄
You have been supplied with a false idol to stop you...

1264
01:37:24,478 --> 01:37:26,901
为了防止你们毁掉这座堕落的城市
...tearing down this corrupt city!

1265
01:37:28,858 --> 01:37:32,488
我来告诉大家 哈维?丹特的真面目
Let me tell you the truth about Harvey Dent.

1266
01:37:32,653 --> 01:37:37,500
这是你们哥谭市警察局局长
From the words of Gotham's police commissioner...

1267
01:37:37,658 --> 01:37:40,036
詹姆斯?高顿写的
...James Gordon: 

1268
01:37:40,620 --> 01:37:43,965
蝙蝠侠救了我儿子
"The Batman didn't murder Harvey Dent. 

1269
01:37:44,123 --> 01:37:46,046
他没有杀害哈维?丹特
He saved my boy... 

1270
01:37:46,250 --> 01:37:50,676
他代替哈维承担那些可怕的罪责
...then took the blame for Harvey's appalling crimes... 

1271
01:37:50,838 --> 01:37:53,466
这些年 我一直满怀愧疚地
...so that I could, to my shame...

1272
01:37:53,633 --> 01:37:57,263
为这个虚假的偶像
...build a lie around this... 

1273
01:37:57,428 --> 01:38:00,147
编造各种谎言
...fallen idol. 

1274
01:38:02,433 --> 01:38:07,360
我一直赞颂这个企图杀害我儿子的疯子
I praised the madman who tried to murder my own child. 

1275
01:38:07,563 --> 01:38:11,318
但现在我无法再忍受这个谎言了
Well, I can no longer live with my lie.

1276
01:38:11,484 --> 01:38:15,239
是时候让哥谭市民知道事情的真相了
It is time to trust the people of Gotham with the truth...

1277
01:38:15,404 --> 01:38:19,500
事到如今 我也该引咎辞职了
...and it is time for me to resign."

1278
01:38:20,451 --> 01:38:23,796
你们愿意接受这个人的辞呈吗
And do you accept this man's resignation?

1279
01:38:25,581 --> 01:38:29,802
你们愿意接受所有这些骗子的辞呈吗
And do you accept the resignation of all of these liars?

1280
01:38:29,960 --> 01:38:31,633
这些无耻的败类
Of all the corrupt?

1281
01:38:35,424 --> 01:38:37,677
那些人在黑门监狱里关了八年
Those men locked up for eight years in Blackgate... 

1282
01:38:37,843 --> 01:38:42,098
惩罚他们的丹特法案却是个谎言
...and denied parole under the Dent Act, it was based on a lie.

1283
01:38:43,140 --> 01:38:44,767
哥谭市需要英雄
Gotham needed a hero.

1284
01:38:44,934 --> 01:38:49,155
比任何时候都需要 你背叛了代表的一切
Well, it needs it now more than ever, but you betrayed everything you stood for.

1285
01:38:51,065 --> 01:38:56,743
这是迫不得已
There's a point far out there when the structures fail you...

1286
01:38:56,904 --> 01:38:59,783
因为那个时候 法律和道德准则 不但无法伸张正义
...when the rules aren't weapons any more...

1287
01:39:00,491 --> 01:39:03,961
还变成了枷锁 约束了好人 让罪犯逍遥法外
...they're shackles, letting the bad guy get ahead.

1288
01:39:05,621 --> 01:39:09,046
有一天 你或许也会
One day, you may face...

1289
01:39:09,208 --> 01:39:10,881
面对这种情况
...such a moment of crisis.

1290
01:39:11,043 --> 01:39:14,343
到那时 我希望你能有一个和我一样的朋友
And in that moment, I hope you have a friend like I did...

1291
01:39:15,005 --> 01:39:20,182
他愿意替你承担罪责 让你能保住名誉和清白
...to plunge their hands into the filth, so that you can keep yours clean!

1292
01:39:21,721 --> 01:39:24,395
现在你已经名誉扫地了 局长
Your hands look plenty filthy to me, commissioner.

1293
01:39:26,016 --> 01:39:29,520
我们要从腐败者手中接管哥谭市
We take Gotham from the corrupt!

1294
01:39:31,814 --> 01:39:32,906
那些有钱人
The rich!

1295
01:39:33,816 --> 01:39:35,784
一直压迫你们 
The oppressors of generations...

1296
01:39:35,943 --> 01:39:40,119
用人人都有机会成功这样的鬼话控制你们
...who have kept you down with myths of opportunity.

1297
01:39:40,281 --> 01:39:43,330
我们要把哥谭还给她的
And we give it back to you...

1298
01:39:43,951 --> 01:39:46,170
市民
...the people.

1299
01:39:47,246 --> 01:39:49,169
哥谭是你们的 
Gotham is yours!

1300
01:39:49,623 --> 01:39:52,968
没有人能干涉 你们自由了
None shall interfere. Do as you please.

1301
01:39:55,212 --> 01:39:58,716
首先要攻破黑门监狱 释放受压迫的人
But start by storming Blackgate and freeing the oppressed!

1302
01:39:58,883 --> 01:40:00,601
<font color="#808080">MAN:</font>
Open it!

1303
01:40:08,517 --> 01:40:11,566
愿意参加的 请向前一步
Step forward, those who would serve...

1304
01:40:13,147 --> 01:40:14,899
一支军队诞生了
...for an army will be raised.

1305
01:40:19,153 --> 01:40:23,750
要把有权有势的人 从他们的豪宅里揪出来
The powerful will be ripped from their decadent nests...

1306
01:40:28,454 --> 01:40:33,961
把他们丢到外面这个残酷的世界 让他们自生自灭
...and cast out into the cold world that we know and endure!

1307
01:40:38,547 --> 01:40:40,641
有钱人会受到审判
Courts will be convened.

1308
01:40:48,307 --> 01:40:50,605
他们的钱 全分给大家
Spoils will be enjoyed.

1309
01:40:55,397 --> 01:40:57,024
血债血偿
Blood will be shed!

1310
01:41:00,361 --> 01:41:03,035
警察只有懂得了
The police will survive...

1311
01:41:03,197 --> 01:41:07,623
真正的正义 才能存在下去
...as they learn to serve true justice. 

1312
01:41:08,744 --> 01:41:11,247
这个伟大的城市
This great city...

1313
01:41:13,415 --> 01:41:14,917
不会灭亡
...it will endure.

1314
01:41:17,628 --> 01:41:21,383
哥谭市会长存
Gotham will survive! 

1315
01:41:43,195 --> 01:41:45,618
他说你得先把背治好
He says you must first fix your back.

1316
01:41:45,865 --> 01:41:46,991
他怎么知道
How does he know?

1317
01:41:47,157 --> 01:41:48,579
他以前是这儿的医生
He was the prison doctor.

1318
01:41:48,742 --> 01:41:52,622
因为吸毒 结果惹毛了
He's a morphine addict who incurred the displeasure...

1319
01:41:52,788 --> 01:41:56,713
一些有权有势的人 包括你那戴面具的朋友
...of powerful people, including your masked friend.

1320
01:41:57,626 --> 01:41:59,128
怎么回事
How?

1321
01:42:00,379 --> 01:42:04,680
很多年前 这里非常黑暗
Many years ago, it was a time of plague.

1322
01:42:06,260 --> 01:42:09,355
当时有一些囚犯攻击了贝恩
Some of the other prisoners attacked Bane.

1323
01:42:11,390 --> 01:42:15,065
医生因为治疗不当
The doctor's fumbling attempts to repair the damage... 

1324
01:42:15,853 --> 01:42:17,480
给他留下了永久性的伤害
...left him in perpetual agony.

1325
01:42:17,646 --> 01:42:20,820
所以他后来一直戴着面具
The mask holds the pain at bay.

1326
01:42:20,983 --> 01:42:24,328
贝恩就是你说的那个孩子 
Bane was the child you spoke of?

1327
01:42:24,486 --> 01:42:25,783
他出生在这儿
He was born here?

1328
01:42:26,739 --> 01:42:31,210
传说有一个为当地军阀效力的雇佣兵
The legend is that there was a mercenary who worked for a local warlord.

1329
01:42:31,952 --> 01:42:34,296
他爱上了军阀的女儿
He fell in love with the warlord's daughter. 

1330
01:42:34,788 --> 01:42:36,381
他们偷偷结婚了
They were married in secret. 

1331
01:42:36,540 --> 01:42:38,542
军阀发现之后
When the warlord found out...

1332
01:42:39,043 --> 01:42:42,889
那个雇佣兵被丢进这个监狱
...the mercenary was condemned to this pit.

1333
01:42:43,464 --> 01:42:45,717
不过后来他被流放
But then he exiled him instead.

1334
01:42:45,883 --> 01:42:49,933
雇佣兵知道的是 军阀的女儿帮他获释
The mercenary understood that it was the daughter who had secured his release. 

1335
01:42:50,095 --> 01:42:54,976
他不知道的是 这份自由的代价很高
But what he could not know was the true price of his freedom. 

1336
01:42:56,018 --> 01:42:57,816
那姑娘代替他坐牢
She took his place in the pit.

1337
01:43:00,940 --> 01:43:02,487
当时她怀孕了 
And she was with child...

1338
01:43:02,650 --> 01:43:04,573
怀着雇佣兵的孩子
...the mercenary's child. 

1339
01:43:07,154 --> 01:43:10,374
无辜的人无法在这儿生存 很快会被消灭
Innocence cannot flower underground. It has to be stamped out.

1340
01:43:12,993 --> 01:43:18,966
有一天 医生忘了锁上牢门
One day, the doctor forgot to lock the cell.

1341
01:43:25,714 --> 01:43:28,058
好在那孩子有个朋友 他对大家说
But the child had a friend... 

1342
01:43:28,509 --> 01:43:33,982
这孩子是他们赎罪的唯一机会
...a protector who showed the others that this innocence was their redemption. 

1343
01:43:34,139 --> 01:43:35,857
应该珍惜保护她
It was to be prized. 

1344
01:43:36,016 --> 01:43:37,768
可她母亲没这么幸运
The mother was not so lucky.

1345
01:43:40,938 --> 01:43:44,613
这里是贝恩的地盘 他不希望有人提这事
This is Bane's prison now. He wouldn't want this story told.

1346
01:43:55,995 --> 01:43:59,716
你背上有根脊椎骨突出来了
There's a vertebra protruding from your back.

1347
01:44:00,082 --> 01:44:02,176
得把它推回去
It has to be put back.

1348
01:44:07,172 --> 01:44:09,971
不要动 直到能站起来
Stay like this until you stand.

1349
01:44:17,266 --> 01:44:22,898
你没想到我会回来吧 嗯
Tsk, tsk, tsk, Did you not think I would return, Bruce? Hmm?

1350
01:44:28,569 --> 01:44:30,196
我说了我是不死之身
I told you I was immortal.

1351
01:44:32,740 --> 01:44:34,868
可是 我看着你死的
I watched... I watched you die.

1352
01:44:35,034 --> 01:44:38,004
哦 永生的形式有很多种
Oh, there are many forms of immortality.

1353
01:44:39,913 --> 01:44:41,381
我有过一个妻子 
Once, I had a wife...

1354
01:44:42,916 --> 01:44:44,634
我一生的挚爱
...my great love.

1355
01:44:46,003 --> 01:44:47,782
可是她被人夺走了
She was taken from me.

1356
01:44:47,782 --> 01:44:49,212
你是那个雇佣兵
You were the mercenary.

1357
01:44:53,427 --> 01:44:55,395
贝恩是你的孩子 
Bane is your child.

1358
01:44:57,014 --> 01:44:58,061
你的继承人
Your heir.

1359
01:44:58,223 --> 01:45:00,976
我的继承人会完成影武者联盟的使命
An heir to ensure the League of Shadows fulfills its duty...

1360
01:45:01,143 --> 01:45:03,771
让文明恢复平衡
...to restore balance to civilization.

1361
01:45:03,937 --> 01:45:04,984
不
No.

1362
01:45:05,147 --> 01:45:08,572
你独自为了哥谭市的腐败奋战多年
You yourself fought the decadence of Gotham for years...

1363
01:45:08,734 --> 01:45:10,657
你倾尽全力
...with all your strength...

1364
01:45:11,028 --> 01:45:15,249
用尽你的资源 和你的道德权威
...all your resources, all your moral authority.

1365
01:45:15,991 --> 01:45:18,995
可最终得到的 只是一个谎言
And the only victory you could achieve was a lie.

1366
01:45:19,620 --> 01:45:22,499
你应该看清了 哥谭无药可救
Now you understand. Gotham is beyond saving.

1367
01:45:22,664 --> 01:45:23,790
不
No.

1368
01:45:23,957 --> 01:45:25,085
哥谭必须毁灭
And must be allowed to die.

1369
01:45:25,085 --> 01:45:26,085
不
No!

1370
01:45:33,008 --> 01:45:35,010
来 这能帮你
Yeah, just lift your head.

1371
01:45:35,427 --> 01:45:36,849
把头抬起来
Oh, that's good.

1372
01:45:42,684 --> 01:45:43,731
不 不
No, no!

1373
01:46:19,096 --> 01:46:20,140
这是哪儿
What's that?

1374
01:46:20,140 --> 01:46:21,340
某个人的家
This was someone's home.

1375
01:46:21,598 --> 01:46:23,521
现在是大家的家
And now it's everyone's home.

1376
01:46:25,310 --> 01:46:28,359
暴风雨来了 你的愿望实现了
There's a storm coming, remember? This is what you wanted.

1377
01:46:57,467 --> 01:47:00,266
这是汽油 疏散的时候可能用得上
It's for the bus, in case there's a chance to evacuate.

1378
01:47:00,429 --> 01:47:01,976
有消息吗 局长安全吗
Any news? Is the commissioner...?

1379
01:47:02,139 --> 01:47:05,484
你还是不知道的好 孩子们好吗
The less you know, Father. How are the boys doing?

1380
01:47:05,642 --> 01:47:08,441
供电恢复了 他们现在可以看电视
Well, we've had more power on, so they've got some TV.

1381
01:47:08,604 --> 01:47:09,947
我先走了
It's good to see you.

1382
01:47:10,647 --> 01:47:14,697
布雷克 出去后要小心 他们对警察毫不留情
Blake, you be careful out there. They're hunting down cops like dogs.

1383
01:47:20,407 --> 01:47:21,704
你为什么要锻炼
Why build yourself?

1384
01:47:24,036 --> 01:47:26,008
我不该死在这里
I'm not meant to die in here.

1385
01:47:26,008 --> 01:47:29,008
这里 那里 能有什么区别
Here, there. What's the difference?

1386
01:48:30,727 --> 01:48:34,072
我早就跟你说过了 这是不可能的
I told you it could not be done.

1387
01:48:34,231 --> 01:48:35,858
你说有个孩子成功了
You told me a child did it.

1388
01:48:37,234 --> 01:48:39,532
那不是普通的孩子 
But no ordinary child.

1389
01:48:39,695 --> 01:48:42,494
那个孩子出生在监狱
A child born in hell. 

1390
01:48:46,827 --> 01:48:48,295
从小受尽磨难
Forged from suffering. 

1391
01:48:50,414 --> 01:48:52,712
在痛苦中成长
Hardened by pain. 

1392
01:48:54,251 --> 01:48:56,879
不像你 一直养尊处优
Not a man from privilege.

1393
01:49:15,939 --> 01:49:17,907
附近有我们的人
We got boots on the ground, sir.

1394
01:49:18,692 --> 01:49:19,784
随时准备行动
Just waiting on intel.

1395
01:49:25,490 --> 01:49:26,537
你有证件吗
You have ID?

1396
01:49:27,242 --> 01:49:28,289
当然没有
Of course not.

1397
01:49:28,452 --> 01:49:29,701
我们怎么相信你
Well, how can we trust you?

1398
01:49:29,701 --> 01:49:31,001
我们只能相信
We don't have any choice.

1399
01:49:31,872 --> 01:49:34,216
高顿局长 特种部队琼斯上尉
Commissioner Gordon. Captain Jones, Special Forces.

1400
01:49:34,374 --> 01:49:35,921
上尉 谢谢你能来
Captain. Glad to have you here.

1401
01:49:36,084 --> 01:49:38,758
这是我的职责 现在 你们有多少人
It's our job, sir. Now, uh, how many of you are there?

1402
01:49:38,920 --> 01:49:41,844
几十个吧  加起来也就这些了
Well, there's dozens. I'd rather not say exactly.

1403
01:49:42,007 --> 01:49:45,261
不过 困在地下的大约有3000人
But the men trapped underground number almost 3000.

1404
01:49:45,427 --> 01:49:46,350
他们情况怎么样
Condition?

1405
01:49:46,350 --> 01:49:47,350
他们有食物和水
Getting food and water. 

1406
01:49:47,512 --> 01:49:48,810
能救出来吗 
Can we break them out?

1407
01:49:48,810 --> 01:49:49,810
是的 长官
es, sir.

1408
01:49:49,973 --> 01:49:52,317
把看守阿克曼公园以南出水管的雇佣兵干掉
Take out the mercenaries south of Ackerman Park.

1409
01:49:52,476 --> 01:49:55,195
炸除碎石 开出个十个人走的通道
Blow the rubble, make a hole big enough for 10 at a time. 

1410
01:49:55,354 --> 01:49:58,574
我和里面的兄弟们联系过了 他们随时准备反击
I'm in contact with my partner who's down there. They're just waiting.

1411
01:49:58,732 --> 01:50:00,987
他们都三个月没见过阳光了
Men who haven't seen daylight in months?

1412
01:50:00,987 --> 01:50:02,987
他们不是一般人 是训练有素的警察
Officers who haven't seen daylight in months.

1413
01:50:03,153 --> 01:50:05,827
炸弹呢 卫星一直找不到它的方位
What about the bomb? Satellite can't pick up radiation hot spots.

1414
01:50:06,365 --> 01:50:09,744
炸弹在一辆卡车里 那车一定是铅顶
hey keep it on a truck. It must have a lead-lined roof. 

1415
01:50:09,910 --> 01:50:11,184
车不停地换地方
They move it constantly.

1416
01:50:11,184 --> 01:50:12,584
知道是哪辆车吗
Good. So you know the truck? 

1417
01:50:12,746 --> 01:50:16,091
是三辆中的一辆 我们在追踪
Well, it's one of three. We've been tracking it. 

1418
01:50:16,458 --> 01:50:17,505
障眼法
Decoy.

1419
01:50:19,044 --> 01:50:20,869
你真觉得他会回来
You don't really think he's coming back?

1420
01:50:20,869 --> 01:50:21,869
我怎么想不重要
Doesn't matter what I think.

1421
01:50:22,631 --> 01:50:26,511
不 这很重要 你应该相信更加真实的东西
Actually, it does. You should put your faith in something a little more real.

1422
01:50:26,676 --> 01:50:27,596
卡车走的路线差异不大
he routes don't vary much.

1423
01:50:27,596 --> 01:50:29,596
引爆器在谁那儿
Okay. What about the triggerman? 

1424
01:50:30,055 --> 01:50:32,105
不知道 可能是虚张声势 
No leads. It's a bluff. 

1425
01:50:32,105 --> 01:50:33,105
贝恩不会把炸弹控制权交给别人
Bane wouldn't give control of that bomb to someone else.

1426
01:50:34,267 --> 01:50:38,488
不能冒这个险 找到引爆器前 只能追踪炸弹
We can't take that chance. Until we have the triggerman, we just track the device.

1427
01:50:38,647 --> 01:50:42,572
与此同时 哥谭市就这么沦陷着 被军阀控制
And meanwhile, Gotham lives under a warlord, like some failed state?

1428
01:50:42,734 --> 01:50:45,613
别这么冲动 警官 城里有几千万人
Dial it back, officer. This situation is unprecedented.

1429
01:50:45,779 --> 01:50:48,036
我们不能轻举妄动
We can't do anything to risk millions of lives.

1430
01:50:48,036 --> 01:50:51,036
告诉他 告诉他真实情况
You gonna tell him what's really going on?

1431
01:50:51,201 --> 01:50:54,296
上尉 这里 这里的情况比你想象的还要复杂
Captain, the situation is more complicated than you think.

1432
01:50:54,454 --> 01:50:56,673
你得见个人
There's someone you need to meet. 

1433
01:50:56,998 --> 01:50:58,878
我爬到楼上 找有利位置 
Came upstairs looking for a vantage point. 

1434
01:50:58,878 --> 01:51:00,878
发现这家公司的高管住在这里
Found the people who run the corporation.

1435
01:51:01,044 --> 01:51:02,216
什么公司
What corporation?

1436
01:51:02,379 --> 01:51:04,757
韦恩集团
Wayne Enterprises. You good?

1437
01:51:13,807 --> 01:51:15,980
福克斯先生 能介绍一下情况吗
Mr. Fox, would you like to brief the captain?

1438
01:51:16,184 --> 01:51:18,778
泰特小姐对这情况很了解
Miss Tate's fully aware of the situation.

1439
01:51:18,937 --> 01:51:23,408
作为韦恩集团的首席执行官 我要对这件事情负全责
And as CEO of Wayne Enterprises, I have to take responsibility for it.

1440
01:51:23,567 --> 01:51:24,569
为什么
Why?

1441
01:51:24,569 --> 01:51:25,569
它是我们造的
We built it.

1442
01:51:25,735 --> 01:51:27,237
炸弹是你们造的
You built the bomb?

1443
01:51:27,404 --> 01:51:31,580
我们造了一个聚变反应堆 想作为能源使用
It was built as a fusion reactor. First of its kind.

1444
01:51:31,741 --> 01:51:35,120
贝恩把核心变成炸弹 从反应堆里拿出来
Bane turned the core into a bomb and removed it from the reactor.

1445
01:51:35,287 --> 01:51:36,666
接下来才是重点
Here's the important part.

1446
01:51:36,666 --> 01:51:38,666
那个装置的燃料电池正在衰退
As the device's fuel cells deteriorate...

1447
01:51:38,832 --> 01:51:40,755
核心会越来越不稳定
...it becomes increasingly unstable...

1448
01:51:40,917 --> 01:51:42,464
最后它就会爆炸
...to the point of detonation.

1449
01:51:42,627 --> 01:51:44,379
这是个定时炸弹
This bomb is a time bomb.

1450
01:51:44,546 --> 01:51:48,551
23天后它就会爆炸 不管贝恩怎么说 
And it will go off in 23 days, regardless of Bane's revolution...

1451
01:51:48,717 --> 01:51:51,436
不管我们采取什么行动 它都会爆炸
...or what we, or the outside world, choose to do.

1452
01:51:51,595 --> 01:51:54,189
就算找到引爆器 它还是会爆炸
So your plan might not be as practical as you thought.

1453
01:51:54,723 --> 01:51:56,194
你能拆除它吗
Could you disarm it?

1454
01:51:56,194 --> 01:51:59,194
我能把核心装回反应堆 让它稳定下来
I could reconnect it to the reactor. Stabilize it.

1455
01:51:59,352 --> 01:52:01,481
我们得离开这儿 通知美国政府
Let's move from this location and call it in.

1456
01:52:01,481 --> 01:52:02,481
好的 我们走
Right. Let's go.

1457
01:52:02,647 --> 01:52:05,867
这些事交给我们 你留在这里照顾他们
No, no, we'll take it from here. You stay and look after these folks.

1458
01:52:13,200 --> 01:52:14,452
有人出卖我们
Someone sold us out.

1459
01:52:16,077 --> 01:52:17,545
没错 快走
Go, go, go!

1460
01:52:38,850 --> 01:52:40,944
我死也不会告诉你的
I'll die before I talk.

1461
01:52:41,645 --> 01:52:43,898
我会成全你的 上尉
I'm on your schedule, captain.

1462
01:52:50,362 --> 01:52:52,706
有人住在楼上
There were people living upstairs.

1463
01:52:53,198 --> 01:52:55,326
把他们抓去审判
Round them up forjudgment...

1464
01:52:59,162 --> 01:53:04,043
这些人的尸体吊出去示众
...and hang them where the world can see.

1465
01:53:06,086 --> 01:53:10,887
我们得到消息 警方已经封锁了整个中央高地和东部公园地区
Police have cordoned off the entire Central Heights and East Park Side areas... 

1466
01:53:11,049 --> 01:53:15,145
以及曼彻伯德海岸大道 他们这样做可能是为了
...as well as Merchant and South Shoreline Boulevards in an attempt... 

1467
01:53:18,765 --> 01:53:22,815
他说要跳过去 靠的不只是体力
He says the leap to freedom is not about strength.

1468
01:53:23,270 --> 01:53:25,238
有体力才能跳过去
My body makes the jump.

1469
01:53:25,730 --> 01:53:29,610
靠的是精神 是灵魂
Survival is the spirit. The soul.

1470
01:53:32,529 --> 01:53:35,499
我的身体和灵魂都已经准备好了
My soul is as ready to escape as my body.

1471
01:53:35,657 --> 01:53:38,661
恐惧会让你失败
Fear is why you fail.

1472
01:53:38,952 --> 01:53:40,499
不 我不害怕
No, I'm not afraid.

1473
01:53:42,163 --> 01:53:43,665
我是愤怒
I'm angry.

1474
01:54:12,902 --> 01:54:14,370
布鲁斯
Bruce.

1475
01:54:15,572 --> 01:54:16,664
我们为什么会跌倒
Why do we fall?

1476
01:54:22,704 --> 01:54:24,581
你不害怕死亡
You do not fear death.

1477
01:54:25,624 --> 01:54:30,175
你以为这能让你变强 其实它让你变弱
You think this makes you strong. It makes you weak.

1478
01:54:30,712 --> 01:54:31,759
为什么
Why?

1479
01:54:31,921 --> 01:54:34,174
以超乎常人的速度前进
How can you move faster than possible...

1480
01:54:34,466 --> 01:54:36,935
以超乎常人的体力战斗
...fight longer than possible...

1481
01:54:37,218 --> 01:54:40,813
你知道这一切精神动力来自哪里
...without the most powerful impulse of the spirit?

1482
01:54:42,057 --> 01:54:43,684
对死亡的恐惧
The fear of death.

1483
01:54:44,392 --> 01:54:46,269
我害怕死亡
I do fear death.

1484
01:54:48,063 --> 01:54:50,031
我害怕死在这里 
I fear dying in here...

1485
01:54:50,815 --> 01:54:52,738
我的城市在燃烧
...while my city burns.

1486
01:54:53,777 --> 01:54:55,700
没有人能拯救她
There's no one there to save it.

1487
01:54:57,072 --> 01:54:58,574
那你就爬出去
Then make the climb.

1488
01:55:03,620 --> 01:55:04,963
怎么爬
How?

1489
01:55:06,456 --> 01:55:08,254
像那个孩子一样
As the child did...

1490
01:55:12,962 --> 01:55:14,635
不用绳子
...without the rope.

1491
01:55:17,300 --> 01:55:19,598
恐惧会带给你力量
Then fear will find you again.

1492
01:55:26,601 --> 01:55:28,854
啊 这是旅行的补给品 
Ah, supplies for your journey?

1493
01:55:29,020 --> 01:55:31,114
真是太好了
Oh, that's wonderful. That's...

1494
01:55:35,652 --> 01:55:37,279
他们在说什么
What does that mean?

1495
01:55:37,821 --> 01:55:39,073
崛起
Rise.

1496
01:55:40,407 --> 01:55:41,454
不
No.

1497
01:57:11,414 --> 01:57:13,337
不 你们搞错了
No, there's been a mistake!

1498
01:57:13,500 --> 01:57:15,502
带我 带我去见贝恩
Take me to Bane!

1499
01:57:18,087 --> 01:57:19,760
我要见贝恩
I want to see Bane!

1500
01:57:23,009 --> 01:57:24,101
肃静
Order!

1501
01:57:24,260 --> 01:57:27,013
你们搞错了 贝恩在哪儿
This is a mistake! Where is Bane?

1502
01:57:27,180 --> 01:57:29,308
我们没搞错 史特莱沃先生 
There's been no mistake, Mr. Stryver.

1503
01:57:29,682 --> 01:57:32,105
你是菲利普?史特莱沃
You are Philip Stryver...

1504
01:57:32,268 --> 01:57:35,772
达盖特工业公司的执行副总裁
...executive vice president of Daggett Industries...

1505
01:57:35,939 --> 01:57:39,569
这些年你利用别人的血汗 踩在别人身上 
...who for years has been living off the blood and sweat...

1506
01:57:39,734 --> 01:57:41,953
才爬到现在这个位置
...of people less powerful than him.

1507
01:57:42,111 --> 01:57:45,206
叫贝恩来 我 我们是自己人
Call Bane. I am one of you.

1508
01:57:45,448 --> 01:57:48,998
贝恩在这里可做不了主 这里是宣判听证会
Bane has no authority here. This is merely a sentencing hearing.

1509
01:57:49,160 --> 01:57:51,288
现在 你自己选择流放 还是死刑
Now, the choice is yours.

1510
01:57:51,454 --> 01:57:53,877
流 流放
Exile or death!

1511
01:57:58,503 --> 01:57:59,925
安静
Order!

1512
01:58:00,505 --> 01:58:01,802
流放
Exi... Exile.

1513
01:58:02,549 --> 01:58:03,971
成交
Sold.

1514
01:58:04,133 --> 01:58:05,885
流放这胆小鬼
To the man in the cold sweat.

1515
01:58:13,268 --> 01:58:14,690
沿着厚冰走
You follow the thick ice.

1516
01:58:14,853 --> 01:58:16,981
要想游泳 几分钟就会冻死
You try to swim, you're dead in minutes.

1517
01:58:17,146 --> 01:58:18,739
有人成功过吗
Has anyone made it?

1518
01:58:32,161 --> 01:58:34,584
人都在哪儿  我们已经没有多少时间了
Where are they? It's not like we have a lot of time. 

1519
01:58:35,039 --> 01:58:36,165
还有多久
How long?

1520
01:58:36,332 --> 01:58:38,175
炸弹明天爆炸
The bomb goes off tomorrow.

1521
01:58:38,585 --> 01:58:40,589
我们还有18个小时做点事
We have about 18 hours to do something.

1522
01:58:40,589 --> 01:58:41,589
要做什么
To do what?

1523
01:58:41,754 --> 01:58:45,759
锁定那辆卡车 装上定位系统 然后才能想办法怎么拆除它
To mark the truck. Get a GPS on it so we can start to figure out how to bring it down.

1524
01:58:52,473 --> 01:58:53,725
就这些人
That's it?

1525
01:58:56,227 --> 01:58:57,319
弗利
Foley.

1526
01:58:58,855 --> 01:59:00,780
该死的弗利在哪儿
Where's Foley, damn it?

1527
01:59:00,780 --> 01:59:02,780
你别到街上去
You shouldn't be out on the streets.

1528
01:59:07,488 --> 01:59:08,712
吉姆 他不在家
Jim, he's not here.

1529
01:59:08,712 --> 01:59:10,412
全城都被人占领了 
You let your wife come to the door?

1530
01:59:10,575 --> 01:59:12,024
你居然让你太太来开门
When the city's under occupation?

1531
01:59:12,024 --> 01:59:13,524
在厨房里等我
Wait in the kitchen, honey.

1532
01:59:13,786 --> 01:59:16,414
你在干嘛 把制服埋在后院了
What did you do, bury your uniform in the backyard?

1533
01:59:16,581 --> 01:59:18,709
你看到他们怎么对待特种部队了
You saw what they did to those Special Forces.

1534
01:59:18,875 --> 01:59:21,219
忘了我们在街头巡逻的日子了
Have you forgotten all the years we were out on patrol?

1535
01:59:21,377 --> 01:59:24,506
那时总有罪犯想在我们转身时给我们一枪
When every gangbanger wanted to plant one as soon as our backs were turned?

1536
01:59:24,672 --> 01:59:28,802
现在情况不一样 他们占领了城市 政府也跟他们做交易
That was different. These guys run the city. The government's done a deal with them.

1537
01:59:28,968 --> 01:59:31,517
贝恩逼得他们走投无路 这不是交易
Bane's got their balls in a vice. That's not a deal.

1538
01:59:31,679 --> 01:59:34,979
你敢抓贝恩 就会马上有人引爆炸弹
You move on Bane, the triggerman is gonna hit the button.

1539
01:59:35,141 --> 01:59:39,112
你以为他会把炸弹的控制权交给别人
You think he's given control of that bomb to one of the people?

1540
01:59:39,270 --> 01:59:41,272
你以为他真会把权力还给市民
You think this is part of some revolution?

1541
01:59:41,439 --> 01:59:44,283
只有一个人手里有引爆器 那就是贝恩
There's one man with his finger on the button. That's Bane.

1542
01:59:44,442 --> 01:59:47,537
有人来救我们之前 只能照他说的做
Look, we've all got to keep our heads down till they can fix this.

1543
01:59:47,695 --> 01:59:49,325
如果你还有家人的话
If you still had a family here...

1544
01:59:49,325 --> 01:59:51,325
你还不明白吗 只有我们自己能
This only gets fixed from inside...

1545
01:59:51,491 --> 01:59:53,084
拯救这座城市
...the city!

1546
01:59:53,409 --> 01:59:55,082
听着 皮特 
Look, Peter.

1547
01:59:56,037 --> 02:00:00,634
我不是要你穿着制服在街上走 但我们得做点什么
I'm not asking you to walk down Grand in your dress blues, but something has to be done.

1548
02:00:00,792 --> 02:00:01,840
对不起 吉姆 我要
Sorry, Jim. I gotta...

1549
02:00:01,840 --> 02:00:02,840
别做胆小鬼
Keep your head down?

1550
02:00:03,002 --> 02:00:05,175
你再怎么躲 明天炸弹都会爆炸
What goods that gonna do when that thing blows?

1551
02:00:05,338 --> 02:00:07,807
谁知道会怎么样呢
You don't know that's gonna happen.

1552
02:00:11,970 --> 02:00:14,268
我听说你缺人手 局长
 I hear you're looking for men, commissioner.

1553
02:00:14,430 --> 02:00:15,682
我能帮忙吗
How about me instead?

1554
02:00:15,848 --> 02:00:18,442
泰特小姐 我 我不能让你冒险
Miss Tate, I, uh, can't ask you to do that.

1555
02:00:19,394 --> 02:00:20,441
求你了
Please.

1556
02:00:22,021 --> 02:00:24,194
你整个废物 你拿了什么
You little punk! What'd you take?

1557
02:00:24,357 --> 02:00:26,655
我没拿 我什么也没拿
Nothing! I didn't take anything!

1558
02:00:26,818 --> 02:00:30,118
敢偷我们 你这个小混蛋
You steal from us, you little bastard?

1559
02:00:30,697 --> 02:00:34,702
现在知道跑到我的地盘来撒野 是什么后果了吗
Now, you boys know you can't come into my neighborhood without asking politely.

1560
02:00:40,623 --> 02:00:43,877
孩子 能追上你的人 别偷他们的东西
Never steal anything from someone you can't outrun, kid.

1561
02:00:50,550 --> 02:00:52,598
作为小偷 你还挺慷慨
You're pretty generous for a thief.

1562
02:01:01,269 --> 02:01:03,022
我以为他们杀了你
I thought they killed you.

1563
02:01:03,022 --> 02:01:04,022
还没有
Not yet.

1564
02:01:04,355 --> 02:01:06,529
如果你指望我道歉的话
If you're expecting an apology, I...

1565
02:01:06,529 --> 02:01:07,529
不用道歉
It wouldn't suit you.

1566
02:01:08,943 --> 02:01:09,990
我要你帮忙
I need your help.

1567
02:01:10,528 --> 02:01:11,996
我为什么要帮你
And why would I help you?

1568
02:01:12,155 --> 02:01:14,157
为了这个 清除程序
For this. Clean slate.

1569
02:01:14,323 --> 02:01:16,325
我曾经出卖过你 
You'd trust me with that?

1570
02:01:16,909 --> 02:01:18,536
你还敢相信我
After what I did to you?

1571
02:01:18,703 --> 02:01:21,627
我承认是有点失望
I'll admit, I was a little let down.

1572
02:01:23,249 --> 02:01:26,378
可我相信你也有好的一面 你要这个程序
But I still think there's more to you. In fact, I think that for you...

1573
02:01:26,794 --> 02:01:28,137
不是用来犯罪 
...this isn't just a tool.

1574
02:01:28,296 --> 02:01:31,516
而是用来逃跑 你想消失 重新开始
It's an escape route. You want to disappear. Start fresh.

1575
02:01:32,425 --> 02:01:33,995
我连这个岛都出不去
I can't even get off this island.

1576
02:01:33,995 --> 02:01:35,395
我能带你离开
I can give you a way off...

1577
02:01:35,553 --> 02:01:37,100
只要你帮我找到福克斯
...once you get me to Lucius Fox.

1578
02:01:37,263 --> 02:01:40,062
帮我查出他被关在哪儿 带我去
Find out where they're holding him and take me in.

1579
02:01:43,811 --> 02:01:44,903
你找他干什么
Why do you need Fox?

1580
02:01:45,063 --> 02:01:46,066
拯救哥谭市
To save the city.

1581
02:01:46,066 --> 02:01:47,566
谁说这里需要拯救 
Who says it needs saving?

1582
02:01:47,732 --> 02:01:49,325
现在这样挺好的
Maybe I like it this way.

1583
02:01:49,484 --> 02:01:51,111
也许吧
Maybe you do...

1584
02:01:52,487 --> 02:01:54,831
不过明天炸弹就会爆炸
...but tomorrow that bomb's going off.

1585
02:01:57,408 --> 02:01:59,126
你的朋友会来帮忙吗
Got your powerful friend on the case?

1586
02:01:59,285 --> 02:02:00,628
我在努力 
I'm trying...

1587
02:02:01,454 --> 02:02:03,081
我需要福克斯
...but I need Fox.

1588
02:02:03,247 --> 02:02:04,999
等它接近时 
As it approaches...

1589
02:02:05,792 --> 02:02:06,964
按下开关
...flip the switch.

1590
02:02:07,126 --> 02:02:09,676
指针到200的时候 给我个信号 
The needle hits 200, you give me the signal, 

1591
02:02:09,676 --> 02:02:10,676
我把探测器装上去
I'll mark the truck. Okay?

1592
02:02:12,048 --> 02:02:13,675
准备 准备
Heads up, heads up.

1593
02:02:29,774 --> 02:02:30,872
成功了
I got it.

1594
02:02:30,872 --> 02:02:32,072
雇佣兵在你后面
Mercenaries on your 6.

1595
02:02:32,235 --> 02:02:35,364
不许动 全都把手举起来
Stand still! Keep your hands where we can see them!

1596
02:02:37,573 --> 02:02:39,621
高顿局长 你被逮捕了
Commissioner Gordon, you are under arrest.

1597
02:02:39,784 --> 02:02:41,502
以什么名义
On whose authority?

1598
02:02:41,661 --> 02:02:42,878
哥谭市民的名义
The people of Gotham.

1599
02:02:43,871 --> 02:02:48,798
没有律师 也没有证人 这算哪门子的法律程序
No lawyer? No witnesses? What sort of due process is this?

1600
02:02:48,960 --> 02:02:52,180
你已经被认定有罪 这里不过是宣判听证会
Your guilt has been determined, this is merely a sentencing hearing.

1601
02:02:52,588 --> 02:02:54,181
你选哪个
Now, what will it be?

1602
02:02:55,383 --> 02:02:58,102
死刑 还是 流放
Death or exile?

1603
02:02:58,261 --> 02:03:03,017
克莱恩 如果你以为我们会心甘情愿的在冰上走
Crane, if you think we're going out onto that ice willingly...

1604
02:03:03,182 --> 02:03:04,775
那你可就想错了
...you have another thing coming.

1605
02:03:07,270 --> 02:03:08,613
那就死刑吧
Death, then.

1606
02:03:08,771 --> 02:03:09,990
似乎只能这样
Looks that way.

1607
02:03:09,990 --> 02:03:10,990
很好
Very well.

1608
02:03:11,149 --> 02:03:12,651
死刑
Death...

1609
02:03:13,985 --> 02:03:15,703
流放的形式
...by exile.

1610
02:03:18,281 --> 02:03:19,749
把他带过来
Bring her to me.

1611
02:03:26,247 --> 02:03:30,468
嗨 我们要走了 布雷克说准备好了 把东西带上
Hey, we're going now. Blake says they're ready! Get your gear on!

1612
02:03:30,626 --> 02:03:33,675
要走了 快点 快点
Hey, you hear me? We're going now. Let's do it.

1613
02:03:37,800 --> 02:03:40,053
给他找个地儿 今天可是大日子
Find this one a spot, got a big day tomorrow.

1614
02:03:40,219 --> 02:03:43,393
是啊 连布鲁斯?韦恩都赶来了
We all do. It's not every day you bag Bruce Wayne.

1615
02:03:45,641 --> 02:03:47,018
- 布鲁斯 - 你没事吧
- Bruce. - You okay?

1616
02:03:47,185 --> 02:03:49,563
你真会选日子休假 韦恩先生
Picked a hell of a time to go on vacation, Mr. Wayne.

1617
02:03:49,729 --> 02:03:51,402
还有多久核心会爆炸
How long until that core ignites?

1618
02:03:51,564 --> 02:03:53,410
还有12个小时就会爆炸
That bomb goes off in 12 hours.

1619
02:03:53,410 --> 02:03:55,410
除非我们能把它装回反应堆
Unless we can reconnect it to the reactor.

1620
02:03:56,152 --> 02:03:58,081
你能救米兰达出去吗
Can you get Miranda out of here?

1621
02:03:58,081 --> 02:03:59,281
今天不行 很抱歉
Not tonight. I'm sorry.

1622
02:04:00,072 --> 02:04:01,325
做你该做的事
Do what's necessary.

1623
02:04:01,325 --> 02:04:02,325
我需要你帮忙
Tonight I need you.

1624
02:04:02,491 --> 02:04:03,914
干什么
What for?

1625
02:04:03,914 --> 02:04:04,914
让我重返战场
To get me back in the game.

1626
02:04:05,077 --> 02:04:09,253
抱歉 扫了你们的兴 不过贝恩想亲自收拾他们
to spoil things, boys, but Bane wants these guys to himself.

1627
02:04:11,584 --> 02:04:13,679
我不会忘记你的 米兰达
I won't forget about you, Miranda.

1628
02:04:13,679 --> 02:04:14,679
我知道
I know.

1629
02:04:23,971 --> 02:04:25,769
你的女朋友真酷啊
I like your girlfriend, Mr. Wayne.

1630
02:04:25,932 --> 02:04:27,775
他才没这福气呢
He should be so lucky.

1631
02:04:33,522 --> 02:04:36,275
如果我靠近贝恩或者炸弹 
Any move I make on Bane or the bomb...

1632
02:04:36,442 --> 02:04:38,319
炸弹就会引爆
...the triggerman sets it off.

1633
02:04:38,486 --> 02:04:41,285
他们不会用无线电和手机 干扰太多
Well, they won't use radio or cell. Too much interference.

1634
02:04:41,447 --> 02:04:43,120
红外线距离太短
Infrared doesn't have the range.

1635
02:04:43,282 --> 02:04:46,035
他们用的应该是电磁波 长波
It'll have to be a microburst. Longwave.

1636
02:04:46,202 --> 02:04:47,000
能阻断吗
Could you block it?

1637
02:04:47,000 --> 02:04:48,000
没问题
Yes.

1638
02:04:48,162 --> 02:04:51,792
不过我需要你蝙蝠车上的电磁脉冲炮
But I'll need the EMP cannon guidance mount from the Bat.

1639
02:04:52,959 --> 02:04:54,586
还记得停在哪儿吗
Remember where you parked?

1640
02:05:08,975 --> 02:05:10,443
飞起来怎么样
She is fly okay?

1641
02:05:11,477 --> 02:05:14,196
不错 是啊 没法自动驾驶 
Yeah, even without the autopilot.

1642
02:05:14,355 --> 02:05:15,325
不过 谢谢
Thanks.

1643
02:05:15,325 --> 02:05:16,325
自动驾驶 有你在要自动驾驶干嘛
Autopilot? That's what you're there for.

1644
02:05:57,064 --> 02:05:59,863
好了 上面安全 快点上来 一次一个
Okay. It's clear. Come on, quick. One at a time.

1645
02:06:03,779 --> 02:06:05,122
等等 等等
Wait, wait!

1646
02:06:06,449 --> 02:06:07,917
罗斯
Ross!

1647
02:06:08,075 --> 02:06:09,452
罗斯
Ross?

1648
02:06:10,077 --> 02:06:11,171
把它锁上
Lock it up

1649
02:06:11,171 --> 02:06:12,171
不 快下去
No, keep down.

1650
02:06:12,830 --> 02:06:14,423
下去
Get down!

1651
02:06:16,042 --> 02:06:17,294
你是谁
Who are you?

1652
02:06:46,697 --> 02:06:47,994
点起来
Light it up.

1653
02:07:05,966 --> 02:07:07,540
爸爸 你快来看呐
Dad, check it out.

1654
02:07:07,540 --> 02:07:09,140
宝贝 快来看呐
Honey, come take a look.

1655
02:07:19,522 --> 02:07:21,240
真是见鬼
Impossible.

1656
02:07:22,024 --> 02:07:23,776
看好米兰达
Keep her close.

1657
02:07:24,443 --> 02:07:26,116
他会来救她
He'll come for her.

1658
02:07:26,445 --> 02:07:28,197
米兰达?泰特在哪儿
Where's Miranda Tate?

1659
02:07:28,864 --> 02:07:30,332
给贝恩带走了
Bane took her.

1660
02:07:30,533 --> 02:07:33,833
他占领了市政厅 周围都是他的军队
He's holed up at city hall, surrounded by his army.

1661
02:07:34,120 --> 02:07:36,623
这个能阻断炸弹的遥控引爆信号
This blocks the remote detonator signal to the bomb.

1662
02:07:36,789 --> 02:07:40,464
天亮前把它装到卡车上 一旦开始 他们可能会引爆
Get it onto it before sunrise. They might hit the button when it starts.

1663
02:07:41,377 --> 02:07:42,549
你说什么开始
When what starts?

1664
02:07:43,045 --> 02:07:44,262
战争
War.

1665
02:08:20,124 --> 02:08:21,250
你漏了一个
You missed a spot.

1666
02:08:24,837 --> 02:08:26,718
如果你单独行动 戴个面具
If you're working alone, wear a mask.

1667
02:08:26,718 --> 02:08:29,718
我反抗他们 不怕被人看见
I'm not afraid to be seen standing up to them.

1668
02:08:29,884 --> 02:08:33,104
不是为了你自己 是为了保护你爱的人
The mask is not for you. It's to protect the people you care about.

1669
02:08:34,805 --> 02:08:36,773
数到五 扔出去
Count to five, then throw.

1670
02:08:47,151 --> 02:08:49,825
伙计 你就没有威力大点的炸弹吗
No offense, but you got something bigger in that belt?

1671
02:09:00,247 --> 02:09:01,376
接下来呢
 What now?

1672
02:09:01,376 --> 02:09:03,376
我全力攻击贝恩
All-out assault on Bane.

1673
02:09:03,542 --> 02:09:05,795
你带着大家尽快过桥
But you need to get people across the bridge.

1674
02:09:05,961 --> 02:09:06,914
为什么
Why?

1675
02:09:06,914 --> 02:09:08,114
万一失败
In case we fail.

1676
02:09:08,380 --> 02:09:11,099
带大家离开 能多救一个是一个
Lead an exodus. Save as many lives as you can.

1677
02:09:11,258 --> 02:09:12,555
不用我留下
You don't need me here?

1678
02:09:12,718 --> 02:09:14,265
你已经给了我军队 
You've given me an army.

1679
02:09:14,428 --> 02:09:15,600
快走吧
Now go.

1680
02:09:16,347 --> 02:09:17,439
谢谢你
Hey, thanks.

1681
02:09:17,598 --> 02:09:18,941
别急着谢我
Don't thank me yet.

1682
02:09:19,099 --> 02:09:21,147
我怕以后没机会了
Well, I might not get a chance later.

1683
02:09:34,990 --> 02:09:36,708
你太客气了
You shouldn't have.

1684
02:09:37,660 --> 02:09:39,833
市中心的隧道被埋住了
The midtown tunnel's blocked by debris...

1685
02:09:39,995 --> 02:09:43,374
用机关炮能打出一条路 让大家逃生
...but the cannons have enough firepower to make a path for people.

1686
02:09:43,541 --> 02:09:45,384
你在这儿等着战斗开始
Wait until the fighting begins.

1687
02:09:45,543 --> 02:09:48,262
你战斗就是为了救你那个傲慢的女朋友
You're gonna wage a war to save your stuck-up girlfriend?

1688
02:09:48,420 --> 02:09:49,467
要发动它 就按
To start it, throttle...

1689
02:09:51,257 --> 02:09:52,431
我会开
I got it.

1690
02:09:52,431 --> 02:09:54,431
我们有45分钟拯救这个城市
We have 45 minutes to save this city.

1691
02:09:54,593 --> 02:09:57,346
不 我有45分钟的时间离开爆炸半径
No, I've got 45 minutes to get clear of the blast radius.

1692
02:09:57,513 --> 02:09:59,013
因为你不可能打败那些人
You don't stand a chance against these guys.

1693
02:09:59,013 --> 02:10:00,913
有你帮忙也许能
With your help, I might.

1694
02:10:00,975 --> 02:10:03,353
我会打通地道 然后闪人
I'll open that tunnel, then I'm gone.

1695
02:10:04,436 --> 02:10:06,029
你没这么无情
There's more to you than that.

1696
02:10:09,692 --> 02:10:11,786
抱歉 一直让你失望
Sorry to keep letting you down.

1697
02:10:15,447 --> 02:10:16,994
跟我走吧 
Come with me.

1698
02:10:18,284 --> 02:10:19,877
救救你自己
Save yourself.

1699
02:10:22,121 --> 02:10:24,840
你又不欠这些人的 干嘛要这么做
You don't owe these people any more.

1700
02:10:24,999 --> 02:10:27,127
你已经给了他们一切
You've given them everything.

1701
02:10:27,293 --> 02:10:28,761
不是一切 
Not everything.

1702
02:10:29,169 --> 02:10:30,421
还不够
Not yet.

1703
02:11:10,461 --> 02:11:12,134
散开 
Disperse!

1704
02:11:12,296 --> 02:11:14,515
快散开 不然我们要开枪了
Disperse or be fired upon!

1705
02:11:15,924 --> 02:11:18,302
我们才是这个城市的警察
There's only one police in this town.

1706
02:11:57,299 --> 02:11:58,972
开火
Open fire.

1707
02:12:50,185 --> 02:12:51,903
- 它来了 - 准备好
- Here it comes! - Get ready!

1708
02:13:21,759 --> 02:13:25,855
你回到这里 是想和你的城市一起灭亡
So you came back to die with your city.

1709
02:13:26,180 --> 02:13:29,980
不 我回来阻止你
No. I came back to stop you.

1710
02:13:41,028 --> 02:13:42,075
上啊
Now!

1711
02:13:55,000 --> 02:13:56,627
怎么会这样
That's impossible.

1712
02:13:58,504 --> 02:14:00,131
快去第五大道
Cut over to Fifth!

1713
02:14:14,186 --> 02:14:16,188
大家快走 到车上去 快 你过来
Here you go. Get on the bus. Go ahead.

1714
02:14:16,355 --> 02:14:18,949
你们俩 还有你 
You, come with me. You too.

1715
02:14:19,149 --> 02:14:22,198
你 你 过来 过来
Hey, you, you, and you, come here, come here.

1716
02:14:22,361 --> 02:14:24,204
其他人都到车上去 快点
Everyone else get on the bus, okay?

1717
02:14:24,363 --> 02:14:27,037
伙计们 你们去挨家挨户敲门 叫大家快走
You guys, you go knock on doors and spread the word, okay?

1718
02:14:27,199 --> 02:14:31,079
炸弹就要爆炸了 可以从南街隧道或者过桥离开
The bomb is gonna go off. Get out by the South Street tunnel or over the bridge.

1719
02:14:31,245 --> 02:14:33,964
每人两个街区 通知完就回来 明白吗
You do two blocks and you get back to the bus, all right?

1720
02:14:34,122 --> 02:14:35,999
去吧  快 快去
Go, go, go!

1721
02:14:36,166 --> 02:14:37,543
他回来了
Is he back?

1722
02:14:38,919 --> 02:14:40,262
都小心点 快去
Keep your eyes open. Go, go.

1723
02:16:02,878 --> 02:16:04,425
看住大门
Cover the doors!

1724
02:16:07,591 --> 02:16:09,138
引爆器在哪儿 
Where's your trigger?!

1725
02:16:09,468 --> 02:16:11,095
它在哪儿
Where is it?!

1726
02:16:12,012 --> 02:16:14,856
你不会把它交给普通人
You'd never give it to an ordinary citizen!

1727
02:16:15,015 --> 02:16:17,643
它在哪儿 引爆器在哪儿
Where is it? Where's your trigger?

1728
02:16:19,019 --> 02:16:21,738
在哪儿 它在哪儿
Where is it?! Where is it?!

1729
02:16:29,529 --> 02:16:31,657
告诉我 引爆器在哪儿
Tell me where the trigger is.

1730
02:16:32,157 --> 02:16:35,752
然后 我会准许你去死
Then you have my permission to die.

1731
02:16:47,881 --> 02:16:49,599
你都被我打残了
I broke you.

1732
02:16:50,884 --> 02:16:52,761
怎么逃出来的
How have you come back?

1733
02:16:52,928 --> 02:16:57,434
你以为就你一个人有本事从那儿逃出去吗
You think you're the only one who could learn the strength to escape?

1734
02:16:57,599 --> 02:16:58,896
引爆器在哪儿
Where's the trigger?

1735
02:16:59,559 --> 02:17:01,903
我可没逃出去
But I never escaped.

1736
02:17:02,771 --> 02:17:04,318
那个孩子
But the child.

1737
02:17:06,108 --> 02:17:08,156
忍者大师的孩子爬出去了
The child of Ra's Al Ghul made the climb.

1738
02:17:08,318 --> 02:17:10,696
可他不是忍者大师的孩子
But he's not the child of Ra's Al Ghul.

1739
02:17:14,616 --> 02:17:15,959
我才是
I am.

1740
02:17:16,410 --> 02:17:18,833
虽然我不是普通人 
And though I'm not ordinary...

1741
02:17:20,163 --> 02:17:21,881
但也是市民
...I am a citizen.

1742
02:17:41,476 --> 02:17:42,648
米兰达
Miranda?

1743
02:17:45,522 --> 02:17:46,569
为什么
Why?

1744
02:17:47,315 --> 02:17:48,658
塔莉娅 
Talia.

1745
02:17:49,484 --> 02:17:52,533
我母亲被杀前为我起了这个名字
My mother named me Talia, before she was killed...

1746
02:17:53,363 --> 02:17:56,788
我本来也会死 多亏了我的保护人 
...the way I would have been killed, if not for my protector...

1747
02:17:57,242 --> 02:17:58,289
贝恩
...Bane. 

1748
02:18:06,251 --> 02:18:07,423
再见
Goodbye.

1749
02:18:09,671 --> 02:18:11,799
我爬出了那个地牢
I climbed out of the pit.

1750
02:18:17,763 --> 02:18:19,561
找到我的父亲
I found my father... 

1751
02:18:22,517 --> 02:18:25,646
带他回到那个监狱报仇
...and brought him back to exact terrible vengeance.

1752
02:18:26,521 --> 02:18:28,273
可那个时候
But by that time... 

1753
02:18:29,399 --> 02:18:33,154
医生和其他囚犯已经伤害了我的朋友
...the prisoners and doctor had done their work to my friend.

1754
02:18:33,320 --> 02:18:34,537
我的保护人
My protector. 

1755
02:18:38,533 --> 02:18:40,035
联盟吸收了我们 
The League took us in. 

1756
02:18:40,410 --> 02:18:41,957
训练我们
Trained us.

1757
02:18:42,329 --> 02:18:45,128
可我父亲一直不肯接受贝恩 
But my father could not accept Bane.

1758
02:18:45,665 --> 02:18:47,417
觉得他是个怪物
He saw only a monster. 

1759
02:18:47,584 --> 02:18:53,466
只要一看到他 我父亲就会想起那个害死他心爱妻子的地方
His very existence was a reminder of the hell he'd left his wife to die in.

1760
02:18:53,882 --> 02:18:57,011
所以父亲把他逐出了影武者联盟
He excommunicated Bane from the League of Shadows.

1761
02:18:57,177 --> 02:19:01,728
其实贝恩唯一的错 就是爱上了我
His only crime was that he loved me.

1762
02:19:03,517 --> 02:19:06,441
我无法原谅我父亲
I could not forgive my father.

1763
02:19:11,066 --> 02:19:12,739
直到你杀死他
Until you murdered him.

1764
02:19:30,585 --> 02:19:36,058
你父亲想杀死 成千上万无辜的人
He was trying to kill millions of innocent people.

1765
02:19:36,341 --> 02:19:39,971
在哥谭市 没几个真正无辜的人 布鲁斯
Innocent is a strong word to throw around Gotham, Bruce.

1766
02:19:42,597 --> 02:19:45,646
我很荣幸能完成我父亲的使命
I honor my father by finishing his work.

1767
02:19:57,821 --> 02:20:02,702
我一直在耐心地等待 等待为我父亲报仇的这一天
Vengeance against the man who killed him is simply a reward for my patience.

1768
02:20:04,202 --> 02:20:05,294
知道吗
You see...

1769
02:20:06,830 --> 02:20:08,173
我不会立刻要你的命 我要你慢慢地死
...it's the slow knife...

1770
02:20:08,331 --> 02:20:10,959
这把刀 
...the knife that takes its time.

1771
02:20:14,754 --> 02:20:15,971
这把刀里
The knife...

1772
02:20:16,798 --> 02:20:20,393
充满了我的仇恨 
...that waits years without forgetting...

1773
02:20:20,677 --> 02:20:23,977
它会悄无声息地滑进你的肋骨
...then slips quietly between the bones.

1774
02:20:25,015 --> 02:20:26,312
我要让你知道
That's the knife...

1775
02:20:27,642 --> 02:20:28,985
什么是绝望
...that cuts deepest.

1776
02:20:29,144 --> 02:20:30,270
不要
Please.

1777
02:20:37,986 --> 02:20:39,988
也许你的动作
Maybe your knife...

1778
02:20:40,989 --> 02:20:42,411
太慢了
...was too slow.

1779
02:20:42,574 --> 02:20:43,996
卡车被攻击了
The truck is under attack.

1780
02:20:44,159 --> 02:20:47,914
是高顿 你教他阻断我的信号
Gordon. You gave him a way to block my signal.

1781
02:20:48,079 --> 02:20:49,126
没关系
No matter.

1782
02:20:51,666 --> 02:20:53,760
他无非多争取了11分钟
He's bought Gotham 11 minutes.

1783
02:20:58,131 --> 02:20:59,633
下来
Come on!

1784
02:21:00,258 --> 02:21:01,680
快下来
This Way!

1785
02:21:07,265 --> 02:21:09,688
别过来 你要干嘛
Stay there! What are you doing?

1786
02:21:10,143 --> 02:21:13,488
布雷克 警察 我要把孩子们送到安全区
Blake, MCU! I'm getting these boys to safety!

1787
02:21:13,647 --> 02:21:14,990
你会把我们全都害死的
You'll get us all killed!

1788
02:21:15,148 --> 02:21:18,152
一旦有人过桥 他们就会引爆炸弹
If anyone crosses this bridge, they'll blow the city!

1789
02:21:18,318 --> 02:21:21,697
炸弹不管怎样都会爆炸 快让我们过去
It's gonna blow anyway! We need to open this bridge, now!

1790
02:21:21,863 --> 02:21:25,037
警官 你要是敢往前走一步 我们就开枪
Detective, if you take one step forward we will shoot you!

1791
02:21:25,200 --> 02:21:28,795
你要是敢往前走两步 我们就把桥给炸了
If you take two steps forward, we will blow the bridge!

1792
02:21:30,872 --> 02:21:34,172
你们先回到车上去等我 好吗
Okay, go back by the bus and wait for me, all right? Go back and wait.

1793
02:21:37,420 --> 02:21:41,391
派人护送 炸弹爆炸前不能有任何闪失
Prepare a convoy. We must secure the bomb until it detonates.

1794
02:21:42,717 --> 02:21:46,438
别杀他 让他感受爆炸的热浪
Don't kill him, I want him to feel the heat.

1795
02:21:47,180 --> 02:21:52,061
我要让他对1千2百万人的死感到愧疚
Feel the fire of 12 million souls you failed.

1796
02:21:57,983 --> 02:21:59,530
再见 我的朋友
Goodbye, my friend.

1797
02:22:07,617 --> 02:22:08,994
再见
Goodbye.

1798
02:22:09,536 --> 02:22:13,040
大家继续前进 在楼梯上包围他们
Keep moving forward! Flank them at the stairs!

1799
02:22:21,256 --> 02:22:23,008
干掉他们
Shoot them.

1800
02:22:23,675 --> 02:22:25,143
全都干掉
Shoot them all.

1801
02:22:34,352 --> 02:22:37,982
你知道我一定会亲手杀了你
We both know that I have to kill you now.

1802
02:22:40,900 --> 02:22:43,119
爆炸时的情景你只能想象了
You'll just have to imagine the fire.

1803
02:22:50,952 --> 02:22:53,000
要我不开枪不杀人
About the whole no-guns thing...

1804
02:22:53,955 --> 02:22:57,004
我还是没有办法同意你的观点
...I'm not sure I feel as strongly about it as you do.

1805
02:23:10,388 --> 02:23:12,015
靠过去
Pull up.

1806
02:23:14,726 --> 02:23:16,148
保持平稳
Stay level.

1807
02:23:28,531 --> 02:23:31,831
我们要逼车队往东走 到反应堆去
We have to force that convoy east to the entrance to the reactor.

1808
02:23:33,661 --> 02:23:36,665
你在地面行动 我在空中 快
I need you on the ground, I'll be in the air. Go.

1809
02:23:36,915 --> 02:23:40,169
现在情况变了 你的命令已经过时了
The situation has changed. Your orders are out of date.

1810
02:23:40,877 --> 02:23:44,347
我是警察 和你一样 现在我要走过去
I'm a cop, like you, and I'm walking out there.

1811
02:23:45,173 --> 02:23:47,267
请你们不要开枪打我
Please do not shoot me!

1812
02:23:49,219 --> 02:23:50,345
给我打他的脚
Shoot at his feet.

1813
02:24:00,355 --> 02:24:02,699
掌握制空权的感觉真好
Nothing like a little air superiority.

1814
02:24:02,857 --> 02:24:04,951
警官 请你停下
Detective! Please stop!

1815
02:24:05,527 --> 02:24:08,622
别走了 警官 停下
Please, detective! Stop!

1816
02:24:08,780 --> 02:24:10,623
不要再走了
Stop walking!

1817
02:24:11,491 --> 02:24:14,210
把桥炸了 快炸
Blow it! Do it!

1818
02:24:25,505 --> 02:24:27,883
你得把炸弹带来 你只有10分钟
You have to get that bomb here. You've got 10 minutes.

1819
02:24:38,852 --> 02:24:41,150
他们想把我们逼到反应堆去
They're pushing us to the entrance of the reactor.

1820
02:24:41,312 --> 02:24:43,781
他们想把核心装回去
They're gonna try to reconnect the core.

1821
02:24:45,066 --> 02:24:46,613
混蛋 
You idiots!

1822
02:24:46,901 --> 02:24:48,699
该死的混蛋
You sons of bitches!

1823
02:24:48,862 --> 02:24:50,614
就知道执行命令 
You're killing us!

1824
02:24:50,780 --> 02:24:52,407
这下我们都完了
Yeah, follow your orders!

1825
02:24:52,782 --> 02:24:55,080
孩子们 围成一圈 把头低下
All right, boys. Get in a circle. Bow your heads.

1826
02:24:57,996 --> 02:24:59,794
再往前点
It's on my side.

1827
02:25:47,754 --> 02:25:50,883
神父 让大家都回到车上去
Hey, Father! Let's get everyone back on the bus, okay? Go, go, go!

1828
02:25:51,049 --> 02:25:52,523
快 快 快 快 回车上去
Back on the bus!

1829
02:25:52,523 --> 02:25:54,123
我们没地方可以去
There's nowhere to go.

1830
02:25:54,761 --> 02:25:55,808
都上车
On the bus!

1831
02:26:52,694 --> 02:26:54,822
一定要逼卡车往东走
You've got to turn the truck east!

1832
02:26:59,742 --> 02:27:01,494
一直开
Stay straight!

1833
02:27:33,234 --> 02:27:36,613
给我搭把手 我们把它的线接上
Give me a hand! We can get a cable on it!

1834
02:27:43,369 --> 02:27:46,213
福克斯教过我怎么销毁反应堆
Fox showed me how to override the reactor.

1835
02:27:49,959 --> 02:27:51,211
噢 天呐
Oh, dear.

1836
02:27:54,922 --> 02:27:58,267
他还教了我怎么紧急灌水
Including the emergency flood.

1837
02:28:14,651 --> 02:28:16,574
你们 谁也 
There's no way...

1838
02:28:17,487 --> 02:28:18,739
别想阻止 
...this bomb...

1839
02:28:19,614 --> 02:28:21,161
炸弹爆炸
...will be stopped.

1840
02:28:22,367 --> 02:28:23,493
你在干嘛
What are you doing?

1841
02:28:23,660 --> 02:28:26,038
防止冲击波 我们不会有事的 动作快点 快
Protection from the blast. We're gonna be all right!

1842
02:28:26,204 --> 02:28:27,501
那可是原子弹
It's an atom bomb!

1843
02:28:27,664 --> 02:28:30,338
你要干嘛 告诉他们吗 让他们绝望地死吗 快
Think they need to hear that? Let them die without hope? Come on!

1844
02:28:31,250 --> 02:28:32,923
准备去死吧
Prepare yourselves.

1845
02:28:34,629 --> 02:28:36,677
我父亲的使命
My father's work...

1846
02:28:37,924 --> 02:28:39,597
完成了
...is done.

1847
02:28:45,390 --> 02:28:46,514
你要干嘛
What are you doing?

1848
02:28:46,514 --> 02:28:48,314
我可以把它运到海湾去
I can get it out over the bay!

1849
02:28:48,768 --> 02:28:50,987
让飞机飞到海面上 然后发射
Set it to fly out over the water, then eject?

1850
02:28:51,145 --> 02:28:52,772
它不能自动驾驶
No autopilot.

1851
02:28:54,399 --> 02:28:57,778
你有机会离开这里 可你却回来了
You could've gone anywhere, been anything. But you came back here.

1852
02:28:57,944 --> 02:28:59,070
你也是
So did you.

1853
02:28:59,529 --> 02:29:01,577
我想我们都是笨蛋
I guess we're both suckers.

1854
02:29:09,247 --> 02:29:11,091
我不在乎你到底是谁
I never cared who you were.

1855
02:29:11,091 --> 02:29:12,091
你是对的
And you were right.

1856
02:29:12,250 --> 02:29:14,844
可哥谭的市民应该知道是谁救了他们
Shouldn't the people know the hero who saved them?

1857
02:29:15,002 --> 02:29:16,174
谁都能做英雄
A hero can be anyone.

1858
02:29:16,337 --> 02:29:19,261
即使他做的事情很简单
Even a man doing something as simple and reassuring...

1859
02:29:19,424 --> 02:29:23,304
比如给一个小男孩披上外套让他安心
...as putting a coat around a young boy's shoulders to let him know...

1860
02:29:23,469 --> 02:29:25,267
让知道生活还在继续
...the world hadn't ended.

1861
02:29:42,989 --> 02:29:44,457
布鲁斯・韦恩
Bruce Wayne?

1862
02:29:57,545 --> 02:30:00,674
快点 都上车 你也是 都上车
Come on! There you go! Okay, you too. Come on, Father.

1863
02:30:19,942 --> 02:30:21,819
快把头低下 它爆炸了
Hey, heads down! This is it!

1864
02:30:22,153 --> 02:30:23,077
不
No.

1865
02:30:23,077 --> 02:30:25,077
不 那是蝙蝠侠
No, that's Batman!

1866
02:31:13,287 --> 02:31:14,584
炸弹爆炸了
That's detonation!

1867
02:31:22,046 --> 02:31:23,969
在海湾里 哥谭安全了
It's out over the bay! Clear of the city!

1868
02:31:43,818 --> 02:31:46,662
我看见美丽的城市
"I see a beautiful city... 

1869
02:31:46,821 --> 02:31:48,949
和杰出的市民
...and a brilliant people... 

1870
02:31:49,198 --> 02:31:51,200
从黑暗中崛起
...rising from this abyss. 

1871
02:31:52,410 --> 02:31:56,415
我看见我为之献出生命的人们
I see the lives for which I lay down my life... 

1872
02:31:56,831 --> 02:31:58,048
平静 
...peaceful... 

1873
02:31:58,791 --> 02:32:02,045
充实 富足 快乐
...useful, prosperous and happy. 

1874
02:32:04,505 --> 02:32:08,135
我看见我在这些人的心里
I see that I hold a sanctuary in their hearts... 

1875
02:32:09,969 --> 02:32:13,143
还有他们后代的心里 都拥有
...and in the hearts of their descendants... 

1876
02:32:13,973 --> 02:32:15,691
神圣的地位
...generations hence. 

1877
02:32:18,394 --> 02:32:22,615
这件事是我做过的所有事里
It is a far, far better thing that I do...

1878
02:32:23,482 --> 02:32:25,450
最美好的一件
...than I have ever done.

1879
02:32:26,485 --> 02:32:30,991
我将要去的地方 它能让我
It is a far, far better rest that I go to...

1880
02:32:33,910 --> 02:32:35,628
安静地长眠
...than I have ever known."

1881
02:32:53,971 --> 02:32:55,393
对不起
I'm so sorry.

1882
02:32:55,765 --> 02:32:57,483
我让你失望了
I failed you.

1883
02:32:59,518 --> 02:33:01,145
你相信我
You trusted me...

1884
02:33:02,730 --> 02:33:03,856
我却丢下你
...and I failed you.

1885
02:33:07,985 --> 02:33:09,783
能改变主意吗
Can I change your mind...

1886
02:33:12,114 --> 02:33:14,037
收回你的辞呈
...about quitting the force?

1887
02:33:14,951 --> 02:33:18,797
我记得你说过 制度会变成枷锁
You know what you said about structures becoming shackles?

1888
02:33:19,163 --> 02:33:22,713
你说得对 我无法忍受不公正的存在
You were right, and I can't take it. The injustice.

1889
02:33:22,917 --> 02:33:27,218
你看 没人知道是谁拯救了这座城市
I mean, no one's ever gonna know who saved an entire city.

1890
02:33:27,421 --> 02:33:28,513
他们知道
They know.

1891
02:33:30,424 --> 02:33:32,142
是蝙蝠侠
It was the Batman.

1892
02:33:50,194 --> 02:33:53,789
女生们先生们 早前韦恩先生立下的遗嘱将不再变更
Mr. Wayne's will was not amended to reflect his more modest estate. 

1893
02:33:53,948 --> 02:33:57,794
屋内的物品将被拍卖
Nonetheless, there are considerable assets to dispose of.

1894
02:33:57,952 --> 02:34:01,422
用来偿还房子的欠款
