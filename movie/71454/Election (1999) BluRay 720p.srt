1
00:04:00,806 --> 00:04:02,239
Hey, Mr. McAllister.

2
00:04:02,307 --> 00:04:04,833
Not wasting any time,
are you, Tracy?

3
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:08,746
You know what they say
about the early bird.

4
00:04:08,816 --> 00:04:10,250
Yeah, I do.

5
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,879
Good luck there, Tracy.

6
00:04:13,956 --> 00:04:16,255
Thanks, Mr. M.
I'll see you in class.

7
00:04:16,326 --> 00:04:17,759
Yup, mm-hmm.

8
00:04:19,330 --> 00:04:20,991
Tracy: None of this
would've happened

9
00:04:21,065 --> 00:04:23,762
if Mr. McAllister hadn't
meddled the way he did.

10
00:04:23,836 --> 00:04:26,271
He should've just accepted
things as they are,

11
00:04:26,339 --> 00:04:28,739
instead of trying
to interfere with destiny.

12
00:04:28,809 --> 00:04:31,779
You see, you can't
interfere with destiny.

13
00:04:31,846 --> 00:04:33,280
That's why it's destiny.

14
00:04:33,348 --> 00:04:35,282
And if you try to interfere,

15
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:37,785
the same thing's
just gonna happen anyway,

16
00:04:37,854 --> 00:04:39,288
and you'll just suffer.

17
00:04:41,859 --> 00:04:44,294
Jim: It's hard to remember
how the whole thing started,

18
00:04:44,362 --> 00:04:45,796
the whole election mess.

19
00:04:45,865 --> 00:04:49,165
What I do remember
is that I loved my job.

20
00:04:49,236 --> 00:04:50,760
I was a teacher,

21
00:04:50,838 --> 00:04:51,862
an educator,

22
00:04:51,939 --> 00:04:54,738
and I couldn't imagine
doing anything else.

23
00:04:54,809 --> 00:04:56,505
Boy: Mr. McAllister.

24
00:04:56,579 --> 00:04:58,206
Mr. M!

25
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:00,603
Quit daydreaming.
Get back to work.

26
00:05:00,737 --> 00:05:04,299
Jim: The students knew
it wasn't just a job for me.

27
00:05:04,375 --> 00:05:05,707
I got involved.

28
00:05:05,777 --> 00:05:07,711
Put down the cards, boys!

29
00:05:07,779 --> 00:05:09,213
This game is over!

30
00:05:09,282 --> 00:05:10,647
Jim: And I cared.

31
00:05:10,716 --> 00:05:12,708
Come on, Wolverines!

32
00:05:12,786 --> 00:05:13,718
Defense! Let's go!

33
00:05:13,787 --> 00:05:15,722
Jim: And I think
I made a difference.

34
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:17,724
I knew I touched
the students' lives

35
00:05:17,792 --> 00:05:20,227
during their difficult
young adult years.

36
00:05:20,296 --> 00:05:24,256
And I took that
responsibility seriously.

37
00:05:24,334 --> 00:05:27,736
In the 12 years
I taught U.S. history,

38
00:05:27,805 --> 00:05:30,240
civics, and current events
at Carver,

39
00:05:30,309 --> 00:05:33,245
I was voted
Teacher of the Year 3 times.

40
00:05:33,313 --> 00:05:35,077
A school record.

41
00:05:35,149 --> 00:05:38,244
Teaching was all
I'd ever wanted to do.

42
00:05:40,255 --> 00:05:43,748
Standing in front of
a roomful of young people,

43
00:05:43,826 --> 00:05:46,261
trying to get them excited
about the world,

44
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:48,265
trying to make them think,

45
00:05:48,333 --> 00:05:51,770
preparing them for the tough
moral and ethical decisions

46
00:05:51,837 --> 00:05:53,771
that they'd face as adults,

47
00:05:53,839 --> 00:05:55,705
that's how I wanted
to spend my life.

48
00:05:56,776 --> 00:05:58,711
So is this
a moral situation

49
00:05:58,779 --> 00:06:00,940
or an ethical situation?

50
00:06:01,015 --> 00:06:03,951
What's the difference between
morals and ethics anyway?

51
00:06:04,019 --> 00:06:05,214
Anybody?

52
00:06:06,789 --> 00:06:08,223
Derek.

53
00:06:08,292 --> 00:06:10,226
Yeah. Ethics is
like when you do

54
00:06:10,294 --> 00:06:12,490
what society tells you
is right to do.

55
00:06:12,564 --> 00:06:13,724
And morals...

56
00:06:16,302 --> 00:06:18,237
Yeah, yeah,
you're on the right track.

57
00:06:18,305 --> 00:06:19,465
Can anybody help him out?

58
00:06:22,176 --> 00:06:23,165
Michelle.

59
00:06:23,244 --> 00:06:25,736
Morals are like...
lessons.

60
00:06:25,814 --> 00:06:27,908
You know, like
the moral of a story.

61
00:06:27,984 --> 00:06:31,751
It's what you learn
from a story or a fable.

62
00:06:31,822 --> 00:06:34,256
Or a life experience. Good.

63
00:06:34,326 --> 00:06:35,588
And ethics?

64
00:06:35,661 --> 00:06:39,257
Um, ethics is how
you use the morals

65
00:06:39,332 --> 00:06:41,358
that you learn
from the story?

66
00:06:41,435 --> 00:06:44,872
Yeah, OK, but I think we're
missing something key here.

67
00:06:44,939 --> 00:06:46,770
What are we missing?

68
00:06:54,752 --> 00:06:55,616
Tracy.

69
00:06:55,687 --> 00:06:57,918
Ethics are rules of conduct...

70
00:06:58,991 --> 00:07:00,390
Jim: Tracy Flick.

71
00:07:00,459 --> 00:07:01,392
Tracy Flick.

72
00:07:01,461 --> 00:07:03,224
I'd seen a lot of
ambitious students

73
00:07:03,296 --> 00:07:04,730
come and go over the years,

74
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:08,258
but Tracy Flick,
she was a special case.

75
00:07:09,438 --> 00:07:11,236
Tracy: Some people say
I'm an overachiever,

76
00:07:11,307 --> 00:07:12,740
but I think
they're just jealous.

77
00:07:12,809 --> 00:07:14,744
My mom always tells me
I'm different.

78
00:07:14,812 --> 00:07:16,245
You know, special.

79
00:07:16,313 --> 00:07:17,747
And if you look
at all the things

80
00:07:17,816 --> 00:07:18,748
I've accomplished so far,

81
00:07:18,817 --> 00:07:21,252
I think you'd have to agree.

82
00:07:27,862 --> 00:07:30,262
<i>Here I am as Hodel in
Fiddler On The Roof.</i>

83
00:07:30,331 --> 00:07:33,267
# Matchmaker, matchmaker,
I'll bring the veil #

84
00:07:33,335 --> 00:07:34,928
#You bring the groom #

85
00:07:35,004 --> 00:07:38,771
Tracy: And here I am on KCHS,
our student-run TV station.

86
00:07:38,843 --> 00:07:40,778
The littering must stop.

87
00:07:40,846 --> 00:07:42,575
Tracy Flick reporting.

88
00:07:42,647 --> 00:07:44,775
Tracy:
But it was in the S.G.A.,

89
00:07:44,851 --> 00:07:46,284
the Student Government
Association,

90
00:07:46,352 --> 00:07:47,786
where I made my biggest mark.

91
00:07:47,855 --> 00:07:49,789
I never missed a single meeting.

92
00:07:49,857 --> 00:07:51,792
And I volunteered
for every committee,

93
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:53,795
as long as I could lead it.

94
00:07:53,863 --> 00:07:54,955
I agree with Ashley!

95
00:07:55,030 --> 00:07:56,725
I think we should rent
the barrels ahead of time

96
00:07:56,799 --> 00:07:58,791
because what happened
last time was a travesty.

97
00:07:58,869 --> 00:08:00,029
It was ridiculous,

98
00:08:00,104 --> 00:08:01,731
and I think it really
reflected poorly on all of us.

99
00:08:01,806 --> 00:08:04,241
Jim: Now Tracy Flick
was poised to win

100
00:08:04,309 --> 00:08:06,778
the presidency
of the student body.

101
00:08:06,846 --> 00:08:09,747
And so far,
she was running unopposed.

102
00:08:09,816 --> 00:08:12,752
Determined by a culture
at a certain time in history.

103
00:08:13,922 --> 00:08:15,787
Jim: Oh, there's
one more thing about Tracy

104
00:08:15,857 --> 00:08:17,485
I think you should know.

105
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:21,657
Her pussy gets so wet
you can't believe it.

106
00:08:21,732 --> 00:08:23,667
[Softly]
Don't tell me that.

107
00:08:23,735 --> 00:08:25,259
Don't tell me that.
I don't want to know that.

108
00:08:25,336 --> 00:08:27,271
Jim: A few months
before the election,

109
00:08:27,339 --> 00:08:29,273
she'd gotten herself
in a little trouble

110
00:08:29,341 --> 00:08:32,800
with my best friend
Dave Novotny.

111
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:34,780
# Foxy #

112
00:08:34,849 --> 00:08:37,284
Jim: Dave came to Carver
the year after I did,

113
00:08:37,352 --> 00:08:39,286
and we hit it off right away.

114
00:08:39,354 --> 00:08:41,289
Dave was one of those guys
who taught

115
00:08:41,357 --> 00:08:42,790
because they never wanted
to leave high school

116
00:08:42,859 --> 00:08:44,293
in the first place.

117
00:08:44,361 --> 00:08:47,297
But basically, he was a good guy.

118
00:08:47,365 --> 00:08:49,800
Our wives became best friends, too.

119
00:08:49,869 --> 00:08:52,303
And when Dave and Linda's
son Darryl was born,

120
00:08:52,371 --> 00:08:54,738
they asked us to be
his godparents.

121
00:08:56,511 --> 00:08:58,945
Tracy: You probably think the worst,

122
00:08:59,013 --> 00:09:01,744
that Mr. Novotny was
taking horrible advantage

123
00:09:01,817 --> 00:09:03,251
of one of his students.

124
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:05,754
But it wasn't like that at all.

125
00:09:05,822 --> 00:09:08,257
Our relationship was
based on mutual respect

126
00:09:08,326 --> 00:09:09,384
and admiration.

127
00:09:09,461 --> 00:09:12,259
I mean, during my
sophomore year in geometry,

128
00:09:12,331 --> 00:09:14,266
it was strictly
professional between us.

129
00:09:14,334 --> 00:09:16,235
I mean, nothing.

130
00:09:16,303 --> 00:09:17,770
It wasn't until junior year

131
00:09:17,838 --> 00:09:19,773
when we worked together
on the yearbook

132
00:09:19,841 --> 00:09:21,775
that things got kind of serious.

133
00:09:21,843 --> 00:09:23,778
One night he took
us editors out to celebrate

134
00:09:23,846 --> 00:09:25,279
after a deadline.

135
00:09:25,348 --> 00:09:27,783
Eventually, Dave and I
were left alone,

136
00:09:27,851 --> 00:09:29,285
and we got to talking.

137
00:09:29,354 --> 00:09:31,288
Not like teacher and student,

138
00:09:31,356 --> 00:09:32,790
but like 2 adults.

139
00:09:32,858 --> 00:09:34,291
You know, Tracy,

140
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:36,295
I notice that
you don't seem to have

141
00:09:36,363 --> 00:09:38,297
any close friends at Carver.

142
00:09:38,365 --> 00:09:40,300
You seem to be kind of a loner.

143
00:09:40,368 --> 00:09:43,133
No, I'm not.
I'm just real busy.

144
00:09:43,205 --> 00:09:45,800
Oh, no. I know, I know
it's not by choice.

145
00:09:45,875 --> 00:09:48,309
I just mean that, that, well...

146
00:09:48,378 --> 00:09:50,813
being the kind of person you are,

147
00:09:50,881 --> 00:09:52,816
it must be really difficult for you

148
00:09:52,884 --> 00:09:54,647
to find somebody
you could talk to.

149
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:56,312
What do you mean?

150
00:09:56,389 --> 00:09:58,789
What kind of person am I?

151
00:10:00,894 --> 00:10:04,831
Tracy, you know, I've been
watching you for going on...

152
00:10:04,899 --> 00:10:06,333
3 years now,

153
00:10:06,402 --> 00:10:09,531
and I think you are
one of the most talented,

154
00:10:09,606 --> 00:10:12,770
hard-working,
sensitive, attractive,

155
00:10:12,843 --> 00:10:14,834
brilliant students l...

156
00:10:14,912 --> 00:10:15,845
No.

157
00:10:17,249 --> 00:10:19,616
Human beings I have ever met.

158
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:21,909
Thank you.

159
00:10:21,988 --> 00:10:24,856
And I know that
sometimes people like you

160
00:10:24,925 --> 00:10:28,863
have to pay a price
for their greatness.

161
00:10:28,931 --> 00:10:31,525
And that price is loneliness.

162
00:10:31,601 --> 00:10:35,038
I don't know.
maybe I'm wrong, but...

163
00:10:35,105 --> 00:10:39,840
it just seems to me like

She even wants to read my novel.

Sure.

OK.

That's what I thought.
I was just checking.

Yeah. Good luck there, Tracy.

for what happened with Dave.

00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:12,754
How could I?

335
00:18:12,824 --> 00:18:15,157
Dave was an adult,
more than twice her age.

336
00:18:15,227 --> 00:18:18,356
Sure, she got on my nerves
once in a while,

337
00:18:18,432 --> 00:18:21,368
but I admired Tracy.
I really did.

338
00:18:22,971 --> 00:18:27,102
Thank God for Diane.
She was my best friend.

Oh, sure, we'd had
our share of bumpy times,

341
00:18:31,449 --> 00:18:34,010
but we'd always seen them through.

After 9 years of marriage,
we were closer than ever.

No. No.

But what if Coach Henderson walks in?

Oh, that's OK.
I took care of him.

So, uh, what you reading?

I'm just reviewing my playbook.

Why?!

The doctors told me
I'd have to quit sports

376
00:20:54,530 --> 00:20:57,159
for at least a couple
of years, if not forever,

It was like the end of my life.

When I got back to school,
everybody was so supportive,

and they all wanted to sign
my cast and everything,

shake the feeling

that now my life had no purpose.

Yeah. I wanted to play
football again so bad

"I cannot make my days longer,

00:37:13,008 --> 00:37:15,033
so I strive to make them better."

With this election,
we here at Carver

763
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:19,113
also have an opportunity

to make our
high school days better.

in the cafeteria

772

and can't afford to buy him
enough spiral notebooks

779
00:37:51,724 --> 00:37:54,660
and give these candidates
the courtesy they deserve,

780
00:37:54,728 --> 00:37:57,596
then you don't deserve to be
called adults but children

781
00:37:57,665 --> 00:37:59,099
because that's what children are,

782
00:37:59,168 --> 00:38:01,102
and you'll be treated like children.

783

make a difference.

00:52:25,554 --> 00:52:26,486
till second period.

987
00:52:26,555 --> 00:52:27,682
Well, I tried you at home,

988
00:52:27,757 --> 00:52:29,588
and we've got a situation here.

989
00:52:29,659 --> 00:52:31,025
If Paul loses
this election tomorrow,

990
00:52:31,094 --> 00:52:32,288
there has to be another one

991
00:52:32,362 --> 00:52:33,590
with posters.

992
00:52:33,665 --> 00:52:35,599
Somebody tore down their posters.

993
00:52:35,667 --> 00:52:37,226
Those posters cost
us a lot of money,

994
00:52:37,303 --> 00:52:38,463
and there's no time
to make any more.

995
00:52:38,537 --> 00:52:39,970
All right, we'll get
to the bottom of it.

996
00:52:40,039 --> 00:52:41,803
We still have some extra ones,
don't we?

997
00:52:41,875 --> 00:52:43,206
Maybe we could just use those.

998
00:52:43,276 --> 00:52:44,209
It was Tammy.

999
00:52:44,278 --> 00:52:45,210
That's who it was.

1000
00:52:45,279 --> 00:52:47,271
Oh, no. Hey, like I said,

1001
00:52:47,349 --> 00:52:48,907
she just wouldn't do
something like that.

1002
00:52:48,984 --> 00:52:50,612
Well, that speech that she gave,

1003
00:52:50,687 --> 00:52:51,984
you know, it was pretty...

1004
00:52:52,055 --> 00:52:54,149
It was out there.

1005
00:52:54,225 --> 00:52:55,522
But we'll get
to the bottom of it.

1006
00:52:55,593 --> 00:52:57,994
I want you two to go back,

1007
00:52:58,063 --> 00:52:59,997
I want you to focus on your studies.

1008
00:53:00,066 --> 00:53:02,899
Mr. McAllister will handle
the whole thing.

1009
00:53:02,969 --> 00:53:04,995
Right, Jim?

1010
00:53:05,072 --> 00:53:09,032
What's that? Oh, yeah.
Sure, yeah, you bet.

1011
00:53:17,655 --> 00:53:19,714
Tracy.

1012
00:53:22,995 --> 00:53:25,988
Tracy, come on in.

1013
00:53:26,065 --> 00:53:28,500
Close the door behind you.

1014
00:53:34,343 --> 00:53:36,471
Have a seat.

1015
00:53:40,285 --> 00:53:43,813
I guess you know
why you're here.

1016
00:53:46,191 --> 00:53:47,420
If it's about the posters,

1017
00:53:47,494 --> 00:53:48,688
I think it's awful.

1018
00:53:48,762 --> 00:53:50,628
I think it's a travesty.

1019
00:53:50,698 --> 00:53:52,097
Travesty, huh?

1020
00:53:52,166 --> 00:53:55,432
Well, that's interesting,

1021
00:53:55,504 --> 00:53:57,769
because I think you did it.

1022
00:53:57,840 --> 00:54:00,036
What?

1023
00:54:01,578 --> 00:54:03,638
Are you accusing me?

1024
00:54:03,715 --> 00:54:05,239
You're not serious.

1025
00:54:05,317 --> 00:54:07,149
Mr. McAllister,
we've worked together

1026
00:54:07,219 --> 00:54:09,484
on the S.G.A. for 3 solid years.

1027
00:54:09,556 --> 00:54:11,581
Besides, my own best banner
was torn down.

1028
00:54:11,658 --> 00:54:12,990
Did I do that, too?

1029
00:54:13,061 --> 00:54:14,460
Were you or were you not

1030
00:54:14,529 --> 00:54:16,464
working in the Looking Glass Office

1031
00:54:16,532 --> 00:54:17,464
over the weekend?

1032
00:54:17,533 --> 00:54:21,265
I was. So?
Mr. Paterno let me in.

1033
00:54:21,338 --> 00:54:23,637
As you know, with my
many responsibilities,

1034
00:54:23,708 --> 00:54:25,175
I often have to come in
on the weekend.

1035
00:54:25,242 --> 00:54:27,268
And I have permission to do so.

1036
00:54:27,346 --> 00:54:30,077
But I left very early,
around 6:30.

1037
00:54:31,317 --> 00:54:35,084
6:30. 6:30?

1038
00:54:35,155 --> 00:54:37,750
How do you know what time
the posters were torn down?

1039
00:54:37,826 --> 00:54:40,489
I don't. I just know

1040
00:54:40,563 --> 00:54:42,087
that they were there when I left.

1041
00:54:42,164 --> 00:54:44,565
I'm giving you helpful
information, that's all.

1042
00:54:44,634 --> 00:54:45,624
You know, instead
of wasting your time

1043
00:54:45,703 --> 00:54:46,692
interrogating me,

1044
00:54:48,031 --> 00:54:48,827
we should be out there

1045
00:54:48,898 --> 00:54:50,059
trying to figure out
who did this.

1046
00:54:50,134 --> 00:54:52,330
OK, Tracy.

1047
00:54:52,404 --> 00:54:54,031
Who do you think did it?

1048
00:54:54,105 --> 00:54:56,006
Whom should we interrogate?

1049
00:54:56,075 --> 00:54:57,804
Well, I don't know.

1050
00:54:57,877 --> 00:54:59,311
You know, it could
have been anybody.

1051
00:54:59,379 --> 00:55:01,779
There's a lot of subversive
elements here at Carver,

1052
00:55:01,849 --> 00:55:05,480
like Rick Thiessen or
Kevin Speck and those burnouts.

1053
00:55:05,554 --> 00:55:06,646
Or what about Tammy Metzler?

1054
00:55:06,722 --> 00:55:07,689
I mean, her whole thing

1055
00:55:07,756 --> 00:55:10,021
is being anti-this and anti-that.

1056
00:55:11,528 --> 00:55:14,726
Tracy, you're
a very intelligent girl.

1057
00:55:14,799 --> 00:55:17,701
You have a lot of
admirable qualities.

1058
00:55:17,769 --> 00:55:19,670
But one day maybe you'll learn

1059
00:55:19,739 --> 00:55:20,797
that being smart

1060
00:55:20,874 --> 00:55:23,503
and doing whatever you
need to do to get ahead

1061
00:55:23,577 --> 00:55:25,169
and, yes, stepping
on other people

1062
00:55:25,247 --> 00:55:26,544
to get there,

1063
00:55:26,615 --> 00:55:30,347
well, there's a whole lot
more to life than that.

1064
00:55:30,419 --> 00:55:33,048
And, in the end, you're
only cheating yourself.

1065
00:55:34,258 --> 00:55:36,454
Why are you lecturing me?

1066
00:55:36,528 --> 00:55:41,125
This isn't the time or
the place to get into it.

1067
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:43,499
But there is,
for just one example,

1068
00:55:43,570 --> 00:55:45,562
a certain former colleague of mine

1069
00:55:45,640 --> 00:55:49,338
who made a very big mistake,
a life mistake.

1070
00:55:49,411 --> 00:55:50,844
Now, I think
the lesson here is that,

1071
00:55:50,913 --> 00:55:54,645
old or young,
we all make mistakes.

1072
00:55:54,717 --> 00:55:56,583
And we have to learn
that our actions,

1073
00:55:56,654 --> 00:56:01,753
all of them, can carry
serious consequences.

1074
00:56:01,827 --> 00:56:05,093
Mm-hmm. I don't know
what you're referring to,

1075
00:56:05,165 --> 00:56:07,861
but maybe if certain
older, wiser people

1076
00:56:07,935 --> 00:56:09,927
hadn't acted like such little babies

1077
00:56:10,004 --> 00:56:11,164
and gotten so mushy,

1078
00:56:11,239 --> 00:56:13,265
then everything would be OK.

1079
00:56:13,342 --> 00:56:15,834
I agree, and I also think

1080
00:56:15,912 --> 00:56:17,743
that certain young and naive people

1081
00:56:17,814 --> 00:56:19,806
need to thank their lucky stars

1082
00:56:19,884 --> 00:56:21,648
and be very, very grateful

1083
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:23,881
the entire school didn't find out

1084
00:56:23,956 --> 00:56:25,356
about certain indiscretions

1085
00:56:25,425 --> 00:56:27,893
that could've ruined
their reputations

1086
00:56:27,962 --> 00:56:31,022
and their chances
to win certain elections.

1087
00:56:31,098 --> 00:56:32,964
And I think
certain older people,

1088
00:56:33,034 --> 00:56:34,969
like you and your colleague,

1089
00:56:35,037 --> 00:56:36,971
shouldn't be letching
after their students,

1090
00:56:37,039 --> 00:56:38,029
especially when some of them

1091
00:56:38,108 --> 00:56:39,939
can't even get
their own wives pregnant,

1092
00:56:40,010 --> 00:56:41,740
and they certainly shouldn't be

1093
00:56:41,813 --> 00:56:44,247
making slanderous accusations,

1094
00:56:44,315 --> 00:56:46,477
especially when certain
young, naive people's mothers

1095
00:56:46,552 --> 00:56:47,884
are paralegal secretaries

1096
00:56:47,954 --> 00:56:49,148
at the city's biggest law firm

1097
00:56:49,222 --> 00:56:51,521
and have won many
successful lawsuits.

1098
00:56:51,592 --> 00:56:54,060
And if you want to keep
questioning me like this,

1099
00:56:54,128 --> 00:56:57,257
I won't continue
without my attorney present.

1100
00:56:59,736 --> 00:57:01,102
[Knock On Door]

1101
00:57:02,239 --> 00:57:04,470
You wanted to see me,
Mr. McAllister?

1102
00:57:04,542 --> 00:57:06,806
Just wait outside, Tammy.

1103
00:57:06,878 --> 00:57:09,814
OK, but is this
about the posters?

1104
00:57:09,882 --> 00:57:12,511
Possibly. Please,
just wait outside.

1105
00:57:12,586 --> 00:57:15,852
OK, because I know who did it.

1106
00:57:15,923 --> 00:57:18,757
So, I'll just be outside.

1107
00:57:22,298 --> 00:57:23,629
Don't go anywhere, Tracy.

1108
00:57:23,700 --> 00:57:25,896
Tammy, come on in here.

1109
00:57:27,406 --> 00:57:29,670
This ought to be good.

1110
00:57:32,545 --> 00:57:34,707
So, what do you have
to tell me, Tammy?

1111
00:57:34,782 --> 00:57:37,114
Well, this is hard for me,

1112
00:57:37,184 --> 00:57:39,312
but I think it's
important to be honest,

1113
00:57:39,387 --> 00:57:40,513
don't you?

1114
00:57:40,589 --> 00:57:42,318
Yeah. What is it, Tammy?

1115
00:57:42,391 --> 00:57:47,524
I did it. I'm the one
who tore down Paul's posters.

1116
00:57:47,598 --> 00:57:50,066
I did it.

1117
00:57:50,134 --> 00:57:51,534
When did you do it?

1118
00:57:51,603 --> 00:57:54,334
I don't know...
Yesterday, Sunday.

1119
00:57:54,407 --> 00:57:56,932
How'd you get into the school?

1120
00:57:58,279 --> 00:57:59,644
Door was open.

1121
00:57:59,714 --> 00:58:01,546
Which door?

1122
00:58:01,616 --> 00:58:04,245
I don't know.
All I know is I did it.

1123
00:58:04,320 --> 00:58:06,254
Well, I don't believe you.

1124
00:58:06,322 --> 00:58:07,984
I have proof.

1125
00:58:20,775 --> 00:58:24,212
#Aaah-a-a-aaah #

1126
00:58:24,279 --> 00:58:28,114
#Aaah-a-a-aaaah #

1127
00:58:29,219 --> 00:58:31,814
#Aaah-a-a-a-aaaah #

1128
00:58:34,726 --> 00:58:35,658
Tracy?

1129
00:58:35,727 --> 00:58:37,161
Yes?

1130
00:58:37,230 --> 00:58:39,255
Looks like today's your lucky day.

1131
00:58:39,332 --> 00:58:40,595
You're off the hook.

1132
00:58:40,667 --> 00:58:43,432
Tammy here has confessed.

1133
00:58:54,152 --> 00:58:56,849
I told you.

1134
00:58:56,922 --> 00:58:57,980
I told you.

1135
00:58:58,056 --> 00:59:00,184
You're gonna pay for my poster!

1136
00:59:00,260 --> 00:59:01,386
OK, easy, now, now,

1137
00:59:01,461 --> 00:59:02,393
quit while you're ahead,

1138
00:59:02,462 --> 00:59:03,987
will you, Tracy?
Just run along.

1139
00:59:04,064 --> 00:59:05,531
Back to class.

1140
00:59:05,599 --> 00:59:07,795
Jim: The rest of
the day was unbearable.

1141
00:59:07,869 --> 00:59:11,306
I kept smelling Linda
on my clothes and my fingers,

1142
00:59:11,374 --> 00:59:14,003
and I just couldn't wait
to get out of there.

1143
00:59:16,246 --> 00:59:18,545
I wanted everything to be perfect

1144
00:59:18,616 --> 00:59:20,141
that afternoon at the motel.

1145

So, Mr. M, I was starting
to think about,

1507
01:23:56,583 --> 01:23:58,711
you know, some ideas
for what we could do.

1508
01:23:58,786 --> 01:24:00,515
I was thinking
it would be cool

1509
01:24:00,588 --> 01:24:01,520
to have a carnival.

1510
01:24:01,590 --> 01:24:03,217
You know, with rides and stuff.

1511
01:24:03,292 --> 01:24:05,454
And it could be for,
like, muscular dystrophy.

1512
01:24:05,528 --> 01:24:08,760
And then on Halloween,
a haunted house.

1513
01:24:08,832 --> 01:24:10,595
You know, a really
good haunted house,

You know, I mean,

1516
01:24:13,204 --> 01:24:15,105
this one would be super-scary.

1517
01:24:15,174 --> 01:24:16,971
And then for homecoming,

1518
01:24:17,043 --> 01:24:18,671
well, you know
how last year's theme

1519
01:24:18,745 --> 01:24:21,236
was "Heaven On Earth"?
Well, this year...

time to talk about this later.

after the assembly.

taking it pretty hard.

Soon the wire services
picked up on the story.

about senior year was Lisa.

1623
01:31:11,998 --> 01:31:13,659
Right before Christmas,
she dumped me.

1624
01:31:13,733 --> 01:31:16,032
One minute, she's
totally in love with me,

1625
01:31:16,103 --> 01:31:20,040
and then boom, she goes after
my football buddy Randy.

1626
01:31:20,108 --> 01:31:22,509
Sometimes I wonder
what would have happened

1627
01:31:22,578 --> 01:31:24,444
if I had actually won
the election.

1628
01:31:24,514 --> 01:31:26,175
Maybe my whole life
would be different.

1629
01:31:26,249 --> 01:31:29,185
Like I might never
have gone to Yosemite

1630
01:31:29,253 --> 01:31:30,983
with Greg and Travis.

1631
01:31:31,056 --> 01:31:33,081
Or maybe I'd be dead.

Tammy: Catholic school
was great.

1634
01:31:40,100 --> 01:31:43,502
I mean, the teachers
kind of sucked,

1635
01:31:43,572 --> 01:31:46,041
and they were supposedly
way more strict.

Let's vote on this issue.

1650
01:32:26,829 --> 01:32:28,660
On top of a very successful
student council year,

1651
01:32:28,731 --> 01:32:30,962
I was in the top
seventh percentile

of my graduating class.

1653

Opposed?

1654
01:32:33,504 --> 01:32:34,732
And I got into Georgetown,
like I wanted,

1655
01:32:34,805 --> 01:32:37,274
with scholarships.

1656
01:32:37,342 --> 01:32:38,775
Approved.

1657

But sometimes I got lonely,
and I'd think about Dave.

Maybe it could have
worked out between us.

I wonder what he's doing now.

1662
01:32:52,228 --> 01:32:56,326
Maybe he finally
finished his novel.

1663
01:32:56,401 --> 01:33:00,839
But you know, even with
all my myriad accomplishments

Besides, nobody had heard
from him in a long time.

I thought I'd finally be

For centuries, people
have come to New York

1705

seeking refuge from
their troubled lives.

Now I am one of them.

1707

Besides, I'd always dreamed
of living in New York.

1708

All that excitement and culture.

Living in the city brings
surprises all the time.

than what I was used to
back in Omaha,

and the rent's pretty darn steep,

but it's got a lot of character.

1716

And I'm cozy enough.

1717

Besides, it's great
not needing a car.

1718

And I get a lot of reading
done on the subway.

The job market is
pretty tight in New York,

for a while,

on a field trip,

there's a staff of
both volunteer docents

and trained educators like myself...

who pick up where
the classwork leaves off.

Her name is Jillian.

She works at the museum, too,
in Signs and Signage.

I've never met anyone
quite like her.

She just got out of
a long relationship, too,

so we're trying
to take it slow.

You might ask if I ever
saw Tracy Flick again.

Well, I did.

1739

Just once.

1740
01:36:35,886 --> 01:36:41,087
I was down in Washington for
a museum educator's conference,

1741
01:36:41,160 --> 01:36:43,492
and I stayed an extra day
to do some sightseeing.

1742
01:36:46,166 --> 01:36:49,227
After an inspiring morning
on the Mall,

1743
01:36:49,303 --> 01:36:53,138
I was on my way to
the Holocaust Museum when...

1744
01:37:27,920 --> 01:37:30,115
I'll never know if she saw me.

1745
01:37:30,189 --> 01:37:31,817
Probably not.

1746
01:37:31,892 --> 01:37:34,361
But in that moment,
all the bad memories,

1747
01:37:34,429 --> 01:37:37,422
all the things I'd ever
wanted to say to her,

it all came flooding back.

1749
01:37:42,539 --> 01:37:44,667
My first impulse
was to run over there,

1750
01:37:44,742 --> 01:37:46,004
pound on her window,

1751
01:37:46,077 --> 01:37:48,444
and demand that she admit
she tore down those posters

1752
01:37:48,514 --> 01:37:51,848
and lied and cheated her way
into winning that election.

But, instead,
I just stood there.

And I suddenly realized
I wasn't angry at her anymore.

1755
01:38:01,831 --> 01:38:04,699
I just felt sorry for her.

things I'm doing,

and then I think about
what her life must be like...

1759
01:38:12,311 --> 01:38:14,940
probably still getting up
at 5:00 in the morning

little dreams...

it just makes me sad.
