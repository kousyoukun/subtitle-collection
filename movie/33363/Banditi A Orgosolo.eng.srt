BANDITS IN ORGOSOLO

2
00:02:55,639 --> 00:03:02,680
This stoy takes place nowadays,
in Sardinia, in the village of Orgosolo.

3
00:03:02,759 --> 00:03:05,640
These men are shepherds from Orgosolo.

4
00:03:05,719 --> 00:03:09,880
Their time is measured according to
seasonal migrations

5
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:14,640
and the search for pasture land
and water.

6
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:19,000
The souls of these men
are still primitive.

7
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:21,600
What is right according
to their law,

8
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:25,200
is not right according to that of
the modern world.

9
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:29,480
The only things that matter to them
are family and community bonds.

10
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:33,840
Eveything else is meaningless,
hostile;

11
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:38,080
so too the State, represented
by the police and the prisons.

12
00:03:44,439 --> 00:03:49,120
What they know of modern civilization
mostly concerns the gun.

13
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:54,560
They use it to hunt, to defend themselves,
but also to attack.

14
00:03:54,639 --> 00:03:58,360
They can become bandits
at any moment,

15
00:03:58,439 --> 00:04:01,920
without even realizing it.

16
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,840
That way.

17
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:24,440
Can't you see there's one missing?

18
00:05:24,519 --> 00:05:29,160
You were sleeping! l already told you
a thousand times, you must not leave them alone!

19
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:34,360
Come on, quick, let's go!
How will we find her in this fog?

20
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:18,000
Come here!

21
00:06:23,839 --> 00:06:28,800
See what you did?
She broke her leg.

22
00:06:30,439 --> 00:06:32,400
Come on!

23
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,440
Come on!

24
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,880
Take the lamb!

25
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:16,000
Heep her still.

26
00:07:21,079 --> 00:07:23,040
Let go.

27
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:27,840
Hard! Pull hard!

28
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:49,200
- Is this your sheepfold?
- Yes.

29
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:53,520
Are you alone here?

30
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,880
No.

31
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,920
There's my brother.

32
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,320
Where is he now?

33
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,160
Over there.

34
00:11:22,039 --> 00:11:24,000
Greetings.

35
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:16,840
l've never seen you around here.
Where do you come from?

36
00:12:16,919 --> 00:12:18,880
We come from vey far.

37
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:24,080
What about those pigs you hid?
Are they yours?

38
00:12:27,639 --> 00:12:30,800
Look,
l don't want any trouble.

39
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:43,040
When are you leaving?

40
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:46,840
He can't walk.

41
00:12:46,919 --> 00:12:50,720
lf he's hurt,
you'd better take him away.

42
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:45,520
- Come and eat!
- l don't want anything.

43
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,360
Come on, sit down.

44
00:13:55,360 --> 00:14:00,320
Haven't you left yet?
You're taking advantage of me!

45
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,560
You even killed the pig!

46
00:14:05,639 --> 00:14:10,520
- Come on, eat! - l don't want any of it.
l'm not used to eating stolen meat!

47
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:14,360
lf anything happens,
l'm the one who'll be blamed!

48
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:18,120
What do you want? We can't leave
before the night comes.

49
00:14:18,679 --> 00:14:21,040
Sure! You're the boss here!

50
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:46,760
Can you give me some water?

51
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:12,360
Give me a light.

52
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:26,280
Listen, you'd better not fight
with the one over there,

53
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:29,320
otherwise you're the one
who'll be sory.

54
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:34,240
Don't wory,
l already feel better.

55
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:37,240
We'll leave
as soon as it gets dark.

56
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:48,040
- How's this year going?
- Bad, vey bad.

57
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:52,400
Are the sheep yours?

58
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:58,200
Yes, they're mine.
l still have to finish paying for them.

59
00:15:58,279 --> 00:16:02,000
This year's been vey bad
where l come from, too.

60
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:05,400
We lost a lot of them.

61
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:10,440
- So... you ty to get by...
- What else can l do?

62
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,680
The police! Come on, let's go!

63
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:33,680
- What are you doing here?
- l'm looking after the sheep.

64
00:17:33,759 --> 00:17:36,200
Give me your papers.

65
00:17:49,799 --> 00:17:53,360
- What's your name?
- Michele Jossu.

66
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:57,960
- From Orgosolo?
- Yes, Orgosolo.

67
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:01,680
Take a look inside.
Take this.

68
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:45,400
- So, are you alone here?
- There's my brother, too.

69
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:49,440
- Where's your brother?
- With the sheep.

70
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:54,480
- You have... only sheep, here?
- Yes.

71
00:18:58,759 --> 00:19:04,520
- Have you seen anyone else
around here? - No, nobody.

72
00:19:04,599 --> 00:19:07,800
Are you really sure?

73
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,440
Yes, l'm sure.

74
00:19:18,839 --> 00:19:23,000
- l found this.
- Let me see.

75
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:29,920
ls this yours?

76
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,960
Yes, it's mine.

77
00:19:35,519 --> 00:19:40,760
- You said you only have sheep.
- l bought it to eat.

78
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:45,800
You're treating yourself well!

79
00:19:48,839 --> 00:19:52,560
This is not Orgosolo's brand.

80
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:56,520
- Where did you buy it?
- At the market.

81
00:19:57,559 --> 00:20:00,720
At the market, did you?
Take this stuff.

82
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:13,960
Take a look around.

83
00:20:57,799 --> 00:21:00,480
l must go to my sheep.

84
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:03,040
No, you're staying here.

85
00:21:03,119 --> 00:21:06,720
But... my brother is young;
they could get lost.

86
00:21:07,519 --> 00:21:10,280
They won't get lost, don't wory.

87
00:21:20,079 --> 00:21:22,120
Damn!

88
00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:01,800
Didn't you know
those pigs were here?

89
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:07,720
l bet you bought them
at the market, too. Let's take a look!

90
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,960
So? What are you doing?

91
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:17,040
Come with us!

92
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:21,920
Get going!

93
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,160
They're all coming, now.

94
00:22:47,319 --> 00:22:49,280
Let's get out of here.

95
00:23:47,359 --> 00:23:49,960
Come on! Run!

96
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:53,080
Who's shooting?

97
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,160
Run!

98
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:37,960
Keep a small fire.

99
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:06,400
- Do you want some bread?
- No, you can eat it.

100
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:11,000
No more bread.

101
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:27,480
Listen, l'm going to the village.
l'll be back tomorrow, early in the morning.

102
00:26:27,559 --> 00:26:31,280
- Aren't we going back to the sheepfold?
- No.

103
00:26:32,319 --> 00:26:34,080
Why not?

104
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:39,320
We can't.
You can sleep here.

105
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:42,440
Don't leave the sheep alone.

106
00:26:42,519 --> 00:26:45,480
Keep your eyes wide open,
you got it?

107
00:26:45,559 --> 00:26:49,960
- If l'm not back by tomorrow,
Iet them graze around here. - Yes.

108
00:26:51,519 --> 00:26:56,880
lf anyone asks you about me,
you don't know where l am. OK?

109
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:27,040
- l have to talk to you.
- Wait a second.

110
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:35,520
Come.

111
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:41,960
Come in.

112
00:28:56,039 --> 00:28:59,160
- Something bad's happened.
- Yes, l know.

113
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:03,480
- What do you know? - They killed
a cop near your sheepfold!

114
00:29:03,559 --> 00:29:08,520
- Eveybody's talking!
- Is he dead? - Yes, he's dead.

115
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:24,760
You can tell me.

116
00:29:24,839 --> 00:29:27,800
What happened?

117
00:29:31,319 --> 00:29:35,760
- Can you warn my mother?
- l'm sending someone, wait.

118
00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:45,920
Mintonia!

119
00:29:54,119 --> 00:29:56,680
- When did you get here?
- Right now.

120
00:29:59,559 --> 00:30:02,320
- Listen, go to Michele's.
- Yes.

121
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:06,160
Tell Michele's mother that he's well
and that she shouldn't wory.

122
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:09,160
- Ask her if the police have been there.
- Yes.

123
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:12,400
And come back right away.

124
00:30:16,759 --> 00:30:20,520
- Be careful and don't let anybody see you.
- Yes.

125
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:31,200
- Did anybody see you earlier?
- No, l don't think so.

126
00:30:31,839 --> 00:30:36,200
- Wait a second.
- Where are you going? - Wait.

127
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,200
Give me some wine.

128
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:42,880
Hey, what's up?

129
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:46,120
You recognize me, don't you?

130
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,080
Were you playing?

131
00:31:51,359 --> 00:31:53,480
Who were you playing with?

132
00:31:54,519 --> 00:31:56,480
Go to bed now.

133
00:32:00,599 --> 00:32:03,160
Come on. It's late.

134
00:32:24,039 --> 00:32:26,000
Aunt Mallena!

135
00:32:37,839 --> 00:32:39,800
Aunt Mallena!

136
00:32:45,839 --> 00:32:47,800
Aunt Mallena!

137
00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:58,480
The problem is they ran away. If only
they had managed to catch them! Scoundrels!

138
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:04,240
- Weren't you with the police? - Yes.
- So they know you didn't shoot.

139
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:07,920
They found the meat in the sheepfold.

140
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:13,840
They'll say l made a deal
with the thieves.

141
00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:19,240
They'll catch them.
You'll see, it's just a matter of time.

142
00:33:20,319 --> 00:33:25,000
Sure, but what do l do in the meantime?
l must stay hidden.

143
00:33:25,079 --> 00:33:28,200
lt's me, Mintonia.

144
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:39,040
- Did you go there? - Yes, l saw her.
- Did she say something? - She's cying.

145
00:33:39,119 --> 00:33:44,520
The police had just left.
They looked eveywhere.

146
00:33:44,599 --> 00:33:48,560
They said he must report at once,
otherwise it'll be even worse.

147
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:54,800
- Did you see any cops? - Yes.
They're going around the whole village.

148
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:59,160
OK, go downstairs now. If anybody
knocks, come and warn us right away.

149
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:03,600
- Yes. - Don't open to anybody.
- Yes, OK. - Be careful!

150
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:12,720
- What will you do?
- l'm going back to my sheep.

151
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:17,280
- Where are they?
- Uphill, with my brother.

152
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:21,320
lt's better if you leave them there.
Otherwise they'll catch you immediately.

153
00:34:22,519 --> 00:34:25,680
No. l won't leave them.

154
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:31,200
- Eveybody who did that, ended up
Iosing them. - You can sell them.

155
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:36,040
- Even if you lose a little in the exchange,
it's still the best thing to do. - l won't sell them.

156
00:34:36,119 --> 00:34:38,880
They must come and get me uphill,
if they want me.

157
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:42,120
You don't want to be a fugitive
forever, do you?

158
00:34:42,199 --> 00:34:45,800
There's little difference to
how l've lived until now,

159
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:48,440
always working in the open county.

160
00:34:53,239 --> 00:34:56,320
Back to the village?

161
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:58,360
Yes.

162
00:35:00,199 --> 00:35:03,160
- Are you well?
- Yes.

163
00:35:05,679 --> 00:35:10,240
l'm taking advantage of you.
It's late, l'd better go.

164
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:15,760
Don't. Stay here. We're making bread.
We'll work all night.

165
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:34,200
Let's do something. Listen...

166
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:38,360
l'm going to Nuoro to see a lawyer.

167
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:43,680
l'll tell him what happened.
Maybe he will give us advice.

168
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:47,240
Well, if you want to go, go ahead.

169
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:50,280
But l don't want to turn myself
in to the police.

170
00:35:51,199 --> 00:35:54,560
l know how these things
end up.

171
00:35:54,639 --> 00:35:58,000
Who knows how long it will be
before the the trial begins,

172
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:00,280
and eveything else!

173
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:03,920
Who's going to support my family?
They are?

174
00:36:16,239 --> 00:36:18,200
They're still around.

175
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:28,560
Thinking of all the efforts
l've always made, ...

176
00:36:28,639 --> 00:36:32,720
since l was a child, ...

177
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:36,760
to finally have my sheep!

178
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:41,800
And l haven't even finished
paying for them.

179
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:46,400
And now...
l really needed all this trouble!

180
00:36:47,519 --> 00:36:50,240
Be a shepherd, sure!

181
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:55,840
Last year was so bad,
half of them died.

182
00:36:57,679 --> 00:37:00,640
And now that l was
making up for it...

183
00:37:04,239 --> 00:37:09,200
That's all l needed to get ruined,
some bandits!

184
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:12,720
l guess we were just born desperate!

185
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:26,200
- Did you bring eveything?
- Yes, the dress and the coat too.

186
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:35,840
Keep it still.

187
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:41,360
- Did anybody see you?
- No.

188
00:38:50,039 --> 00:38:53,680
Let go. Tell Gonario
l went to Punta Sulitta.

189
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:56,520
- When he needs me, he'll find me there.
- Yes.

190
00:38:56,599 --> 00:39:00,480
- Please, go visit my mother.
- Yes, l will.

191
00:39:58,239 --> 00:40:01,160
Here, this is your stu_.

192
00:40:01,239 --> 00:40:04,920
Watch it when you eat,
we haven't got much.

193
00:40:07,039 --> 00:40:11,880
Now you must look after the sheep, alone.
From here, we can keep an eye on the road.

194
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:16,760
lf we see the police, we can get away.
l'm staying nearby.

195
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:19,800
- When are you coming back?
- Evey now and then, to help you out.

196
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:22,840
You never saw me,
you don't know anything.

197
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:27,800
These are the papers. If they ask you
about the sheep, eveything's written there.

198
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:30,440
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

199
00:41:29,079 --> 00:41:32,040
OK, now put it in the mould.

200
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:39,760
Take the other one.
Hury up.

201
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:49,160
Squash it.

202
00:41:49,239 --> 00:41:51,200
Turn it.

203
00:42:02,039 --> 00:42:06,800
- Have you seen anyone? - No.
- Are you sure? - Yes.

204
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:31,640
Why is there no shepherd around?

205
00:42:31,719 --> 00:42:34,440
These are bad places.

206
00:42:34,519 --> 00:42:40,480
ln winter you have snow, in summer there's
no water. You must know your way around.

207
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:46,560
l like it here, though.

208
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:01,080
Have you ever been here before?

209
00:43:02,119 --> 00:43:04,080
With our father.

210
00:43:07,639 --> 00:43:10,600
What were you looking after? Goats?

211
00:43:12,239 --> 00:43:16,800
Yes, many of them.
We had more than 400.

212
00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:24,080
Did they all belong to the master?

213
00:43:25,039 --> 00:43:27,000
Yes, all of them.

214
00:43:29,039 --> 00:43:31,400
So, dad died here?

215
00:43:32,599 --> 00:43:34,560
Over there.

216
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:47,240
Where?

217
00:43:50,239 --> 00:43:52,520
There, below that peak.

218
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:56,880
Were you there with him?

219
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:58,920
l was far away.

220
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,960
How did it happen?

221
00:44:04,039 --> 00:44:07,000
He was looking for some lost goats.

222
00:44:07,079 --> 00:44:10,040
lt was dark...
and he fell into a ravine.

223
00:44:13,239 --> 00:44:15,200
When did you find him?

224
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:20,320
The day after.

225
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:25,360
He was almost dead because of the cold
and l couldn't do anything.

226
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:41,880
- How was our father? - He was a good man.
He made people respect him.

227
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:47,160
But did he ever have his flock?

228
00:44:47,239 --> 00:44:50,160
He was... unlucky.

229
00:44:50,239 --> 00:44:55,200
- But you managed to have yours.
- At least for the moment.

230
00:44:57,719 --> 00:45:03,080
- Aren't we going back to the sheepfold?
- No, not now.

231
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:08,080
What did you do?
Why are they looking for you?

232
00:45:08,159 --> 00:45:12,200
There was some trouble,
with some strangers.

233
00:45:17,559 --> 00:45:21,200
lt was you... who started shooting?

234
00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:25,320
Go back to the sheep!
Go, right now!

235
00:45:26,559 --> 00:45:28,520
Get going!

236
00:45:34,639 --> 00:45:36,600
Hury up!

237
00:47:02,599 --> 00:47:06,200
Who are you looking for?

238
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:08,800
- Where's Michele?
- He's not here.

239
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:13,320
l must talk to him at once,
it's something vey important.

240
00:47:28,159 --> 00:47:30,120
What do you want from Michele?

241
00:47:30,199 --> 00:47:35,080
Gonario sent me. l brought the donkey
with me, to cary all the stuff.

242
00:47:41,039 --> 00:47:45,040
- Did you meet anyone
on your way? - No.

243
00:47:45,119 --> 00:47:47,320
Call him, quick!

244
00:47:52,840 --> 00:47:56,200
- What's this?
- Something to eat.

245
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:05,360
Don't move, wait here.

246
00:48:19,320 --> 00:48:21,680
Watch out.

247
00:48:26,639 --> 00:48:30,800
- Why is it you? - Gonario couldn't come,
they're keeping an eye on him.

248
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:34,800
- What did he say? - To be careful.
The police are making patrols.

249
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:38,440
There are hundreds of them.
They're searching eveywhere.

250
00:48:38,519 --> 00:48:42,080
They've come from Cagliari,
those with the black beret.

251
00:48:42,159 --> 00:48:45,760
They have trucks and tents.
They're coming here.

252
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:48,800
Gonario said you must
Ieave at once.

253
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:52,240
lf you stay with your sheep,
they'll catch you for sure.

254
00:48:52,320 --> 00:48:55,960
- What about my mother?
- She sent you some bread.

255
00:48:56,880 --> 00:49:02,360
- How is she? - She's so worried!
She's always thinking about the two of you.

256
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:07,080
Michele! Take a look,
there are some cars over there!

257
00:49:07,159 --> 00:49:09,160
Look at the dust!

258
00:49:09,239 --> 00:49:13,160
You see, they're coming!
Run! They're looking for you!

259
00:49:13,239 --> 00:49:15,720
Run, quick! Climb up the tree.

260
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:18,920
Hand me that stuff!

261
00:49:24,719 --> 00:49:26,680
Quick!

262
00:49:47,519 --> 00:49:50,960
Tell Gonario
l'm taking the sheep with me.

263
00:49:51,039 --> 00:49:55,640
Tell him to sell this stuff. Half the money's
for my mother, half for the debt.

264
00:49:55,719 --> 00:49:58,640
- OK, but what about you?
- l'm leaving.

265
00:49:58,719 --> 00:50:00,680
Michele!

266
00:50:19,639 --> 00:50:22,200
Come on! Let go!

267
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:28,120
Be careful.
Go that way.

268
00:50:28,199 --> 00:50:32,760
You will find another crossing soon.
Go down that way; you won't meet them.

269
00:50:32,840 --> 00:50:37,600
l'm getting out of this place.
l'm crossing the mountains, if l can.

270
00:50:38,559 --> 00:50:40,520
Run!

271
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:58,400
They can't walk any further.
l'm going to a place nearby.

272
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:00,840
Look after the sheep.

273
00:53:02,119 --> 00:53:04,680
l'll be back when it's dark.

274
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:10,760
We have to walk at night,
as long as we are in the Orgosolo region.

275
00:53:10,840 --> 00:53:12,800
What if they find us?

276
00:53:14,639 --> 00:53:18,280
l don't think they will.
We've walked a long way.

277
00:53:18,360 --> 00:53:21,880
Wait for me here.
Don't move from here.

278
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:11,680
- What's your name?
- Jossu Giuseppe.

279
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:15,200
- What are you doing here?
- l'm with my sheep.

280
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:17,280
Give me the papers.

281
00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:50,960
- Are you Michele's brother?
- Yes, we're brothers.

282
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:55,960
- Where is he?
- l don't know.

283
00:54:57,039 --> 00:54:59,760
But the sheep are his.

284
00:55:01,880 --> 00:55:05,120
lt's written here!

285
00:55:05,199 --> 00:55:07,880
Yes, they're his.

286
00:55:07,960 --> 00:55:12,320
- So, he's here!
- No, he's not.

287
00:55:16,239 --> 00:55:18,800
Get that bag.

288
00:55:43,119 --> 00:55:45,920
What's that stu_ for?

289
00:55:47,480 --> 00:55:51,240
- For making cheese.
- And you do it alone?

290
00:55:52,519 --> 00:55:53,960
Yes.

291
00:55:54,159 --> 00:55:59,200
- Where do you sleep at night?
- In the open county.

292
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:02,360
Who are you tying to kid around with?

293
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:08,480
What kind of stoy is that?
Your brother's here and you know it!

294
00:56:08,559 --> 00:56:11,960
Come on, talk!
Where did he go?

295
00:56:12,039 --> 00:56:14,640
Talk! We're going to catch him anyway.

296
00:56:14,719 --> 00:56:16,640
Did he hide himself?

297
00:56:16,719 --> 00:56:20,560
ls he close?
You'd better answer!

298
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:39,360
- Did you find anything?
- A few footsteps. He must be around here.

299
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:44,080
- Did the kid say anything?
- Nothing at all! They're all the same!

300
00:56:45,039 --> 00:56:48,880
There's nothing to be done: they learn
how to tell lies before they've been born.

301
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:52,440
Let's threaten him by saying we're taking him
to the police station. That'll bring his memoy back.

302
00:56:52,519 --> 00:56:55,680
Maybe he really doesn't know
where his brother is.

303
00:56:55,760 --> 00:57:00,720
He's around here for sure.
We'd better hide in the woods.

304
00:57:00,800 --> 00:57:04,480
We can hide around here and wait
until it gets dark. He won't leave him alone.

305
00:57:04,559 --> 00:57:06,520
What if he gets away?

306
00:57:06,599 --> 00:57:10,640
No way! How could he, with all the sheep?
We'll hear the bells.

307
00:57:11,880 --> 00:57:13,840
Let's go.

308
00:57:42,599 --> 00:57:45,720
They found him. Quick!

309
00:58:03,559 --> 00:58:06,120
This way!

310
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:29,040
The police were here.
l hid the sheep over there.

311
01:01:29,119 --> 01:01:32,720
- Were they shooting at you?
- Yes, from a distance.

312
01:01:32,800 --> 01:01:37,320
They came back last night,
they walked right below here.

313
01:01:37,400 --> 01:01:43,000
- Many of them? - Yes, many.
- Which way did they go?

314
01:01:43,840 --> 01:01:46,840
- So?
- That way.

315
01:01:52,840 --> 01:01:55,800
Let's hury, before they come back.

316
01:02:46,239 --> 01:02:49,600
- We must go that way.
- How?

317
01:02:49,679 --> 01:02:53,320
There's a crossing.
If we find it, we'll be safe.

318
01:02:53,400 --> 01:02:55,360
What if the police see us?

319
01:02:55,440 --> 01:02:59,120
We just have to get to the bottom.
They don't know which way to go.

320
01:02:59,199 --> 01:03:01,160
Where do we go after that?

321
01:03:01,239 --> 01:03:06,000
Beyond the mountains, to a sheepfold
l know. They won't look for us there.

322
01:03:06,079 --> 01:03:10,360
- What about the water? - There's a little
at the bottom, but we must walk fast.

323
01:03:10,440 --> 01:03:15,200
- The sheep are tired.
- Get going! What else can we do?

324
01:04:08,880 --> 01:04:10,440
They saw us!

325
01:04:10,519 --> 01:04:14,480
They won't catch us,
they're too far. It's almost dark.

326
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:11,520
Look, there's a shepherd over there.
Maybe there's some water too.

327
01:06:05,639 --> 01:06:08,160
Who said
you could take the water?

328
01:06:08,239 --> 01:06:12,680
We're taking just a little to let
the animals drink. They're dying of thirst.

329
01:06:12,760 --> 01:06:16,960
And when they're done,
what will be left for mine?

330
01:06:29,840 --> 01:06:31,800
You can't refuse
some water.

331
01:06:31,880 --> 01:06:34,960
- Where do you come from?
- From Orgosolo.

332
01:06:35,039 --> 01:06:38,360
- Are these yours?
- Yes.

333
01:06:58,639 --> 01:07:01,480
The animals are worn out,
can't you see?

334
01:07:01,559 --> 01:07:05,000
They're tired.
We've walked for a long time.

335
01:07:09,639 --> 01:07:13,240
Can't you see their legs are hurt?
Where are you taking them?

336
01:07:13,320 --> 01:07:15,480
Downhill, if l can.

337
01:07:15,559 --> 01:07:19,240
And you're taking them this way?
They're all going to die!

338
01:07:19,320 --> 01:07:23,120
How long can it take to cross
these mountains?

339
01:07:23,199 --> 01:07:25,240
You can do it in one day.

340
01:07:25,320 --> 01:07:29,280
- Come on, get going!
- Let them drink!

341
01:07:29,360 --> 01:07:33,240
They've had enough!

342
01:08:09,800 --> 01:08:13,600
They can't make it,
they're tired.

343
01:08:20,880 --> 01:08:25,240
- What are you doing?
- They can't make it.

344
01:08:25,319 --> 01:08:30,840
- Come on! - It's useless, they're too thirsty.
- Come on! Get going!

345
01:08:38,720 --> 01:08:42,640
Hey! Come on.

346
01:08:51,359 --> 01:08:54,640
Come on, ty to walk.
Give it to me.

347
01:09:59,239 --> 01:10:03,200
Come on, we're almost there.
You see the plain ahead?

348
01:10:05,439 --> 01:10:07,400
Come on, walk!

349
01:10:17,800 --> 01:10:20,280
What is it? You feel ill?

350
01:10:21,199 --> 01:10:23,280
l don't know, l'm thirsty.

351
01:10:23,840 --> 01:10:26,800
You have a fever?

352
01:10:28,680 --> 01:10:30,640
My head is spinning.

353
01:10:31,239 --> 01:10:33,680
You really can't go on?

354
01:10:44,720 --> 01:10:49,800
Well, get some rest.
l'll ty to find some water for you.

355
01:10:49,880 --> 01:10:54,440
lt's too late now, going on is useless.
We won't get to the plain.

356
01:10:54,520 --> 01:10:56,840
There's a shelter over there.

357
01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:14,760
Come on, drink.

358
01:11:27,640 --> 01:11:33,400
- How do you feel?
- My head's on fire.

359
01:11:33,479 --> 01:11:35,440
l'm cold.

360
01:11:43,039 --> 01:11:46,000
We've almost arrived, haven't we?

361
01:11:47,239 --> 01:11:49,640
Yes, we have.

362
01:11:50,640 --> 01:11:56,680
- Will the police still come and look for you?
- No, l hope not.

363
01:11:58,119 --> 01:12:01,920
What do they want to do?

364
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:07,400
- They want to send me to prison.
- But you didn't do anything, did you?

365
01:12:09,239 --> 01:12:12,720
- No.
- Why are they looking foryou, then?

366
01:12:15,319 --> 01:12:21,000
- Someone shot a cop and killed him.
- Who did it?

367
01:12:22,359 --> 01:12:24,320
Some strangers.

368
01:12:33,720 --> 01:12:39,000
You mean they can send you to prison,
even if you didn't do anything?

369
01:12:39,079 --> 01:12:41,040
Sure.

370
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:45,960
How?

371
01:12:46,880 --> 01:12:48,840
They're going to indict me.

372
01:12:52,439 --> 01:12:55,400
Where's the trial going to take place?

373
01:12:57,760 --> 01:13:02,840
ln court. In Nuoro, or Cagliari...
Even on the mainland.

374
01:13:02,920 --> 01:13:07,160
Why don't they catch the others?
You're innocent!

375
01:13:07,239 --> 01:13:11,200
They don't even know who the others are.
But they know me.

376
01:13:12,319 --> 01:13:15,760
How long are they going to keep you
in prison?

377
01:13:17,079 --> 01:13:19,040
Maybe ten years.

378
01:13:19,720 --> 01:13:21,680
Twenty, thirty...

379
01:13:24,479 --> 01:13:29,240
- Running away was the right thing to do, then.
- Well, get some sleep now.

380
01:13:41,359 --> 01:13:45,280
ls the place where we're going
any good for grazing?

381
01:13:45,359 --> 01:13:48,120
We'll be fine there.

382
01:13:51,680 --> 01:13:55,080
And there'll be a lot of water?

383
01:13:55,159 --> 01:13:57,120
Yes.

384
01:14:02,680 --> 01:14:07,960
- The sheep will be fine again, won't they?
- Get some rest now.

385
01:16:13,239 --> 01:16:16,520
What happened?

386
01:16:16,600 --> 01:16:18,560
They're dying.

387
01:16:19,880 --> 01:16:21,840
Why are they all dying?

388
01:16:25,880 --> 01:16:29,000
That's their destiny, l guess.

389
01:16:30,720 --> 01:16:32,680
What are we going to do?

390
01:16:42,239 --> 01:16:44,960
l'm taking you back to the village.

391
01:16:45,840 --> 01:16:47,520
What about you?

392
01:16:49,039 --> 01:16:54,640
- l have no choice. - What about the sheep?
- What else can we do?

393
01:18:41,840 --> 01:18:45,280
Why are you taking this with you?

394
01:18:45,359 --> 01:18:49,560
Don't you understand it's useless now?
Throw it away! Throw it away!

395
01:18:50,960 --> 01:18:53,920
We don't have any sheep any more.

396
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:57,200
lt's over.

397
01:20:48,399 --> 01:20:50,960
- What are you doing here?
- Is Gonario here?

398
01:20:51,680 --> 01:20:53,640
He's upstairs.

399
01:20:54,880 --> 01:20:59,280
- Can you call him?
- Wait a second.

400
01:21:07,159 --> 01:21:12,040
- Why don't you come in? - No.
- Come and eat something. - l don't feel like it.

401
01:21:15,640 --> 01:21:18,880
- How's Michele?
- He's fine.

402
01:22:22,760 --> 01:22:26,840
- What happened?
- Michele wants to talk to you. - Where is he?

403
01:22:26,920 --> 01:22:32,160
- He's at Bannedda's wine shop.
- How is he? Is he sick? - No.

404
01:22:32,239 --> 01:22:34,200
l'm going right away.

405
01:22:34,279 --> 01:22:38,160
Feed Peppeddu.
And tell them l'll be right back.

406
01:22:38,239 --> 01:22:41,200
- Come inside for a while.
- No. - Wait.

407
01:22:44,880 --> 01:22:47,160
Where are you going? Wait.

408
01:22:54,960 --> 01:22:56,920
Keep this.

409
01:23:03,600 --> 01:23:06,560
This was delivered to your house.

410
01:23:10,680 --> 01:23:13,640
The Court sent it.

411
01:23:19,199 --> 01:23:22,280
What's written in it?

412
01:23:22,960 --> 01:23:25,880
lt says...

413
01:23:25,960 --> 01:23:30,920
.. aggravated robbey,
criminal association.

414
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:33,320
And they hold you responsible...

415
01:23:33,399 --> 01:23:37,040
.. for the policeman that's
been killed.

416
01:23:37,119 --> 01:23:42,880
They're convinced you're guilty
because you've become a fugitive.

417
01:23:48,199 --> 01:23:53,520
- Where are the sheep?
- They've all died.

418
01:23:53,600 --> 01:23:56,560
How will you honour your debt?

419
01:23:57,479 --> 01:24:02,080
l've managed to keep them waiting,
but they said that they're selling your house...

420
01:24:02,159 --> 01:24:04,120
.. if you don't pay.

421
01:24:05,239 --> 01:24:11,480
- Is my mother aware of this? - No.
l didn't want to scare her too much.

422
01:24:11,560 --> 01:24:15,720
She's hasn't been herself any more,
since they've been after you.

423
01:24:15,800 --> 01:24:19,600
The la_er is asking for a lot
of money, too.

424
01:24:25,279 --> 01:24:30,280
l understand.
Tell them l'm going to pay back eveybody!

425
01:24:30,840 --> 01:24:36,000
Peppeddu will stay here now.
You have to find a new master for him.

426
01:24:36,079 --> 01:24:38,040
Do you need anything?

427
01:24:39,319 --> 01:24:40,680
Yes.

428
01:24:41,720 --> 01:24:43,680
A gun.

429
01:27:04,960 --> 01:27:08,440
- Throw the gun away!
- What do you want?

430
01:27:09,199 --> 01:27:11,160
Throw it away, l said!

431
01:27:13,239 --> 01:27:15,480
Get on the ground!

432
01:29:38,079 --> 01:29:41,400
What did l do to you?
Why do you want to ruin me?

433
01:29:41,479 --> 01:29:45,840
They ruined me too.
Ty to find a way to get by.

434
01:29:48,760 --> 01:29:52,160
Don't ty to follow me,
tomorrow they'll already be sold.

435
01:29:52,239 --> 01:29:56,000
Wait! Stop!
Don't take them all!

436
01:29:57,920 --> 01:30:01,400
l'm just like you...
What did l do to you?

437
01:30:03,079 --> 01:30:07,680
You have no conscience!
God will never forgive you for this!

438
01:30:10,439 --> 01:30:15,280
How will l live if you take them away?
You're making a poor wretch out of me!

439
01:30:16,960 --> 01:30:19,760
l'll find you again!

440
01:30:22,840 --> 01:30:25,640
Wherever you go, l'll find you!

441
01:30:27,840 --> 01:30:33,280
That's all you can do!
Stealing others' stufF!

442
01:30:34,640 --> 01:30:38,640
l'll get back at you... as long as l live!

443
01:30:41,640 --> 01:30:43,600
Scoundrel!

444
01:30:44,039 --> 01:30:46,000
Thief!

445
01:30:48,039 --> 01:30:50,760
Bandit!

446
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:07,000
