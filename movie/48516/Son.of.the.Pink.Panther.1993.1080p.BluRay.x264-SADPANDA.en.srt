1
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:00,710
She's good.

2
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:05,044
Good, huh?

3
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:08,255
Yes, she's good.

4
00:05:11,102 --> 00:05:12,559
As good as you?

5
00:05:15,232 --> 00:05:16,348
Maybe.

6
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:25,902
Better.

7
00:05:42,384 --> 00:05:44,922
She was only showing how good she is.

8
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:47,924
I know how good she is...

9
00:05:48,557 --> 00:05:50,594
or she wouldn't be with us.

10
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:06,780
There is to be no fighting amongst us.

11
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:08,945
Understood?

12
00:06:12,581 --> 00:06:13,947
Here they come.

13
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:35,635
I wish you wouldn't smoke.

14
00:06:38,315 --> 00:06:40,147
We should never have sent you to America.

15
00:06:40,275 --> 00:06:42,483
You picked up such appalling habits there.

16
00:06:42,611 --> 00:06:44,022
And nobody smokes in Lugash.

17
00:06:44,154 --> 00:06:45,520
That's different.

18
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:47,154
Of course.

19
00:06:47,282 --> 00:06:49,444
There's nothing wrong with America, Father.

20
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:51,984
My mother was American. You married her.

21
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:54,616
Your mother never smoked.

22
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:57,824
I'm surprised you noticed.

23
00:06:58,168 --> 00:07:01,832
She wasn't dead three weeks
before you married that woman.

24
00:07:04,174 --> 00:07:06,541
You'll no doubt be pleased to know...

25
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:09,885
that I am about to pay the price
for that folly.

26
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:12,839
Then the rumor is true?

27
00:07:13,975 --> 00:07:15,511
Yes, it would seem so.

28
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:18,849
But, Yasmin, please keep it to yourself.

29
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:24,062
I don't want to alert your stepmother
until I have proof.

30
00:07:41,211 --> 00:07:42,327
Card.

31
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:52,003
Praise Allah someone in this family is lucky.

32
00:07:55,058 --> 00:07:56,674
Cash this in.

33
00:07:57,185 --> 00:07:59,347
How did you know I can be trusted?

34
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:06,859
I'm sorry. I thought you were
one of my bodyguards. It's all right.

35
00:08:07,862 --> 00:08:10,445
What's the going rate on a slap these days?

36
00:08:14,411 --> 00:08:15,902
You're cheap.

37
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:25,920
I must apologize for my daughter.
She is a very high-spirited girl.

38
00:08:47,444 --> 00:08:49,481
It looks like a distress flare.

39
00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:29,145
Yasmin, get in your cabin.

40
00:09:29,194 --> 00:09:30,856
- Wait a minute.
- Now!

41
00:09:32,947 --> 00:09:34,358
Gentlemen.

42
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:39,529
Haven't we met before?

43
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:41,941
Not formally.

44
00:11:50,293 --> 00:11:53,001
Now, be a nice little princess...

45
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:55,329
and go to sleep.

46
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:09,225
Hi, Dad.

47
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:18,019
The safety of your daughter
depends on two things.

48
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:20,988
First, $100 million...

49
00:12:21,032 --> 00:12:23,490
discreetly deposited into a Swiss account.

50
00:12:23,534 --> 00:12:24,900
No problem.

51
00:12:25,036 --> 00:12:26,868
Second, to abdicate.

52
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:30,831
Renounce the throne?

53
00:12:31,209 --> 00:12:33,201
That is impossible.

54
00:12:35,546 --> 00:12:37,503
Then Yasmin will die.

55
00:12:38,716 --> 00:12:40,503
Who is to succeed me?

56
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:43,882
All in good time.

57
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:48,181
What a shame.
I enjoyed your company at the tables.

58
00:12:50,687 --> 00:12:52,019
And I yours.

59
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:12,915
Stop!

60
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:14,203
I said stop!

61
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:23,626
We haven't time to humor
some bumpkin cop.

62
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:25,552
Lose him.

63
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:28,718
I said stop!

64
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:33,598
Hey! Can you hear me?

65
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:38,773
I think we've lost him.

66
00:13:40,403 --> 00:13:41,439
Yeah.

67
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:44,605
Look out!

68
00:13:52,582 --> 00:13:54,073
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

69
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:55,332
No!

70
00:13:56,336 --> 00:13:57,998
One of my passengers is hurt.

71
00:13:58,087 --> 00:13:59,168
No wonder.

72
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:01,668
The way you drive,
you're lucky they are not all dead.

73
00:14:01,758 --> 00:14:03,590
- The way I drive?
- Yes.

74
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:06,172
Could we please settle this at the hospital?

75
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:08,299
No. I'm Police Commissioner Dreyfus.

76
00:14:08,431 --> 00:14:10,764
I demand to see your driver's license.

77
00:14:11,351 --> 00:14:12,808
As you wish.

78
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:23,439
That felt good.

79
00:14:24,489 --> 00:14:26,822
Now then, is anyone hurt?

80
00:14:27,158 --> 00:14:28,774
Yes, in the van.

81
00:14:29,035 --> 00:14:31,948
- My sister is unconscious.
- She is?

82
00:14:31,996 --> 00:14:34,613
- She should be taken to the hospital.
- Where is she?

83
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:35,993
In the van.

84
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:38,663
Excuse me, your sister is in his van?

85
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:41,332
- No, you see...
- No, it is not my van.

86
00:14:41,464 --> 00:14:43,330
Look, I'm Commissioner Dreyfus...

87
00:14:43,466 --> 00:14:46,675
- if you would allow me...
- Excuse me. Just a moment.

88
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:50,967
Excuse me,
when I asked you if anyone was hurt...

89
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:53,974
you replied, "Yes, in my van."

90
00:14:54,644 --> 00:14:59,309
No, no. I said, "Yes, in the van."
Not "in my van."

91
00:14:59,357 --> 00:15:03,192
No, no. You did not say, "Yes, in the van."

92
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:04,560
Not "Yes, in the van."

93
00:15:04,654 --> 00:15:07,988
You said... You did not say,
"Yes, my van," not "Yes, the van."

94
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:10,570
- Look.
- You said, "Yes, my van," not "Yes, the van."

95
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:13,198
- Did you hear what I just said?
- Yes. I heard.

96
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:16,163
- It's my van.
- Now we're getting someplace.

97
00:15:16,207 --> 00:15:17,573
Listen, you imbecile...

98
00:15:17,667 --> 00:15:20,831
Watch your tongue, monsieur.
I am an officer of the leau.

99
00:15:20,878 --> 00:15:22,164
What?

100
00:15:22,213 --> 00:15:24,250
- I said...
- I know what you said.

101
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:26,673
You said you are an officer of the...

102
00:15:27,093 --> 00:15:28,334
leau.

103
00:15:28,678 --> 00:15:31,011
Please. My sister may be dying.

104
00:15:34,517 --> 00:15:37,510
Please. Stand back. Stand back, please.

105
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:45,024
You've been hunting?

106
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:46,730
Yes. Hunting.

107
00:15:48,531 --> 00:15:49,897
Very perceptive.

108
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:01,370
Hello.

109
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:03,205
Hello.

110
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:12,878
Who are you?

111
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:16,890
I am Gendarme Jacques Gambrelli.

112
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,017
Second Class.

113
00:16:19,896 --> 00:16:22,980
- Who are you?
- I am...

114
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:46,495
Your sister is very...

115
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:49,501
very unconscious.

116
00:16:49,926 --> 00:16:53,340
Yes. I suspect she has received
the beump on the head.

117
00:16:53,596 --> 00:16:55,258
- What?
- Bump.

118
00:16:55,932 --> 00:16:58,766
- What?
- Never mind. Come, FranÃ§ois.

119
00:17:00,603 --> 00:17:03,971
Yes. She requires
immediate emergency treatment, Mr...

120
00:17:04,357 --> 00:17:06,019
- Jones.
- Jones.

121
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:09,310
Take her quickly
to the Nice hospital, Mr. Jones...

122
00:17:09,403 --> 00:17:11,440
and I will phone ahead...

123
00:17:11,572 --> 00:17:15,486
to tell them that you are...
Mr. Jones, please stop!

124
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:20,029
Wait! Mr. Jones, my hand, my finger!

125
00:17:36,764 --> 00:17:40,348
There is no time now
to examine your credentials...

126
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:43,639
and make out the report. But I have an idea.

127
00:17:45,856 --> 00:17:49,349
You shall drive me to the nearest phone...

128
00:17:58,327 --> 00:18:01,161
I'm sorry we are late.
We've had a car accident.

129
00:18:01,581 --> 00:18:03,413
Nothing too serious, I trust.

130
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:05,035
We are lucky to be alive.

131
00:18:05,126 --> 00:18:06,367
Please.

132
00:18:06,544 --> 00:18:08,035
Now, Chief. Listen.

133
00:18:08,838 --> 00:18:12,923
Normally, investigation of crimes
committed in French territorial waters...

134
00:18:13,009 --> 00:18:14,716
is your responsibility.

135
00:18:15,052 --> 00:18:19,046
But as this kidnapping is politically
so important to the government...

136
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:22,929
the President has ordered me
to personally take charge of the case.

137
00:18:23,227 --> 00:18:26,971
Understand, it is not that he thinks
you are less qualified.

138
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:31,062
- Perhaps he feels, after all, that I am...
- More qualified.

139
00:18:32,486 --> 00:18:34,398
What are your orders?

140
00:18:34,572 --> 00:18:38,065
First, I want to know everything
that is known about the case.

141
00:18:38,159 --> 00:18:40,742
- This is everything we have to date.
- Good.

142
00:18:40,911 --> 00:18:43,403
And I want your best man as liaison.

143
00:18:43,497 --> 00:18:45,159
That would be Gambrelli.

144
00:18:47,835 --> 00:18:49,918
I'll study this report tonight.

145
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:53,296
- I'll see you here in the morning at 9:00.
- Right.

146
00:18:53,591 --> 00:18:57,961
By the way,
there was a police officer at the accident.

147
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:02,263
How shall I say,
he had an odd way of speaking.

148
00:19:02,642 --> 00:19:04,429
Mispronouncing words.

149
00:19:07,605 --> 00:19:09,892
Crashed his bicycle into our car.

150
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:12,266
Doesn't ring a bell.

151
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:15,485
Perhaps it's not that important.

152
00:19:16,238 --> 00:19:17,945
See you in the morning.

153
00:19:25,331 --> 00:19:27,789
- This way, Your Highness.
- I need water.

154
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:35,296
- Can you get me water?
- Yes. Right away.

155
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:41,295
Take your clothes off.

156
00:19:41,764 --> 00:19:43,130
No.

157
00:19:43,516 --> 00:19:45,303
Take your clothes off!

158
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:47,551
No.

159
00:19:48,521 --> 00:19:52,356
- I'll do it for you.
- Let go of me! Get your hands off me!

160
00:19:55,403 --> 00:19:56,939
You get your...

161
00:19:58,406 --> 00:20:00,147
What about the cop?

162
00:20:00,574 --> 00:20:02,190
The longer we wait...

163
00:20:02,785 --> 00:20:05,653
He would probably show up at the hospital.

164
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:08,075
and abdicate the throne?

165
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:13,368
Are you willing to accede to their demands?

166
00:20:15,172 --> 00:20:16,413
Arnon...

167
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:20,800
try to make it look like an accident.

168
00:20:28,978 --> 00:20:31,391
What makes you think he will show up?

169
00:20:31,856 --> 00:20:33,518
Oh, just a hunch.

170
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:40,482
Look.

171
00:21:23,991 --> 00:21:25,402
He won't be long.

172
00:21:25,743 --> 00:21:27,029
Why not?

173
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:31,079
Because there was something phoney
about Mr. Jones...

174
00:21:31,373 --> 00:21:34,366
and those hunters
with their automatic weapon.

175
00:21:34,543 --> 00:21:37,206
I think Mr. Jones just wanted
to get out of there.

176
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:41,461
I don't believe he had any intention
of taking his sister to the hospital.

177
00:21:45,596 --> 00:21:47,679
Looks like you might be right.

178
00:23:23,193 --> 00:23:24,809
What is he doing?

179
00:23:25,279 --> 00:23:27,487
What does it look like he's doing?

180
00:24:57,496 --> 00:24:59,112
What if he drowns?

181
00:24:59,748 --> 00:25:02,081
He can't. Not yet!

182
00:25:10,884 --> 00:25:13,592
What am I doing? I can't swim. Help!

183
00:25:15,973 --> 00:25:18,681
- What's wrong?
- I can't swim.

184
00:25:19,727 --> 00:25:20,843
Neither can I.

185
00:25:20,936 --> 00:25:24,225
- Then why aren't you drowning?
- Because it's easier to stand.

186
00:25:24,314 --> 00:25:25,850
- What?
- Yes.

187
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:32,361
Who are you?

188
00:25:32,448 --> 00:25:35,156
Gendarme Jacques Gambrelli.
Second Class.

189
00:25:35,284 --> 00:25:38,402
- Who are you?
- Commissioner Dreyfus. Police.

190
00:25:40,289 --> 00:25:43,873
Come on, Gambrelli. I'll give you a lift home.

191
00:25:51,842 --> 00:25:54,710
But why would the man
in the van want to kill me?

192
00:25:55,262 --> 00:25:57,970
Maybe it had something to do
with the unconscious girl.

193
00:25:58,057 --> 00:26:00,674
You had a good look at her. We didn't.

194
00:26:02,269 --> 00:26:05,387
"She walks in beauty, like the night

195
00:26:05,481 --> 00:26:09,270
"Of cloudless climes and starry skies"

196
00:26:09,943 --> 00:26:11,525
Very poetic.

197
00:26:11,987 --> 00:26:13,944
Yes. Leurd Byron.

198
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:15,355
Leurd?

199
00:26:24,625 --> 00:26:27,493
Thank you for the lift, Commissioner.
Good night.

200
00:26:29,004 --> 00:26:30,370
Wait here.

201
00:26:31,965 --> 00:26:34,002
You live here alone, Gambrelli?

202
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:36,383
No, I live with my mother.

203
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:39,383
I would like to meet your mother.

204
00:26:39,473 --> 00:26:42,307
Why not?
Everybody wants to meet my mother.

205
00:26:43,227 --> 00:26:44,468
Excuse me, Ma.

206
00:26:45,145 --> 00:26:48,638
This is Police Commissioner Dreyfus.
He wants to meet you.

207
00:26:48,732 --> 00:26:50,940
How do you do, Mrs. Gambrelli?

208
00:26:51,235 --> 00:26:55,980
- I hope it's not too late.
- No, please come in, Commissioner.

209
00:27:02,162 --> 00:27:03,994
I'm sorry I'm a bit wet.

210
00:27:05,541 --> 00:27:07,123
I'm sorry...

211
00:27:07,209 --> 00:27:08,666
I'm a bit wet. Yes.

212
00:27:08,752 --> 00:27:11,290
- Please, have a seat, Commissioner.
- Yes.

213
00:27:11,839 --> 00:27:13,171
Thank you.

214
00:27:16,593 --> 00:27:19,506
I am just going upstairs
to change my clothes.

215
00:27:19,847 --> 00:27:22,635
- Do you speak Italian, Commissioner?
- No, not really.

216
00:27:22,724 --> 00:27:23,965
- Darling.
- Yes.

217
00:27:39,116 --> 00:27:42,029
Now bring the Commissioner down
one of your robes.

218
00:27:49,918 --> 00:27:52,205
He's just like his father.

219
00:27:52,504 --> 00:27:54,871
Would you care to join me in the kitchen?

220
00:27:54,965 --> 00:27:56,877
I would indeed.

221
00:28:19,656 --> 00:28:22,694
Refreshing to hear
some good singing for a change.

222
00:28:23,744 --> 00:28:25,406
Jacques loves opera.

223
00:28:39,927 --> 00:28:42,670
Are you musically inclined, madame?

224
00:28:43,096 --> 00:28:45,133
- No.
- His father?

225
00:28:46,099 --> 00:28:48,182
He played the French horn.

226
00:28:49,645 --> 00:28:51,261
That probably accounts for it.

227
00:29:23,845 --> 00:29:25,802
Why did you name him Jacques?

228
00:29:26,014 --> 00:29:27,346
Why not?

229
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:29,549
It's a perfectly good French name.

230
00:29:29,643 --> 00:29:31,350
Yes, but you're Italian.

231
00:29:37,526 --> 00:29:39,939
I knew a man once named Jacques.

232
00:29:41,905 --> 00:29:44,568
When he died 10 years ago, I said:

233
00:29:45,117 --> 00:29:48,360
"Thank God there can never be
another one like him."

234
00:29:49,871 --> 00:29:52,238
And then I met your son.

235
00:30:09,391 --> 00:30:12,634
So I decided he would be better off
if he never knew.

236
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:15,724
- You mean his father is...
- Clouseau.

237
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:32,782
Commissioner?

238
00:30:40,797 --> 00:30:42,038
Your Highness.

239
00:30:43,925 --> 00:30:45,166
Yasmin.

240
00:30:47,637 --> 00:30:50,050
I have a little snack for you.

241
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:10,490
Under different circumstances...

242
00:31:10,577 --> 00:31:12,409
we could have had such fun.

243
00:31:14,456 --> 00:31:15,742
What happened?

244
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:20,205
Make sure she doesn't get out of there.

245
00:31:21,838 --> 00:31:23,750
We need to get you a doctor.

246
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:27,257
Oh, dear. Come, gentlemen, let us begin.

247
00:31:27,344 --> 00:31:30,633
You shouldn't have done that.
Now we're all unsterilized.

248
00:31:36,603 --> 00:31:37,935
How are you?

249
00:31:38,105 --> 00:31:39,312
Terrible.

250
00:31:39,815 --> 00:31:41,852
No doubt it was a beum.

251
00:31:42,442 --> 00:31:44,274
- A what?
- A bomb.

252
00:31:45,445 --> 00:31:47,186
You should rest, Charles.

253
00:31:48,031 --> 00:31:50,239
How do you know my first name?

254
00:31:50,617 --> 00:31:52,324
You told me in the ambulance.

255
00:31:52,411 --> 00:31:54,573
That's strange. I don't remember.

256
00:31:55,497 --> 00:31:57,204
But I remember you.

257
00:31:57,290 --> 00:31:59,782
You said, "My name is Charley Dreyfus...

258
00:32:00,043 --> 00:32:02,285
"and I am going to be a policeman."

259
00:32:02,421 --> 00:32:04,128
I used to say that...

260
00:32:04,214 --> 00:32:05,580
as a child.

261
00:32:05,966 --> 00:32:09,130
- I must have been delirious.
- No, you were very sweet.

262
00:32:09,845 --> 00:32:10,926
I was?

263
00:32:12,305 --> 00:32:15,719
What's this? Something's happened.

264
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:29,270
What are you doing?

265
00:32:40,167 --> 00:32:42,329
What are you doing? Give me that bowl.

266
00:32:42,419 --> 00:32:43,500
Give it to me.

267
00:32:43,587 --> 00:32:44,703
Stop it.

268
00:32:49,092 --> 00:32:51,175
Something terrible has happened.

269
00:32:54,097 --> 00:32:55,838
Now, don't play with it again.

270
00:32:55,932 --> 00:32:57,343
Thank you, Nurse.

271
00:32:57,851 --> 00:32:59,683
No, you should relax now.

272
00:32:59,769 --> 00:33:01,681
No, I can't relax.

273
00:33:02,189 --> 00:33:03,851
I have to tell him something.

274
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:05,556
What's his name, your son?

275
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:07,642
- Jacques.
- Listen, Jacques.

276
00:33:07,736 --> 00:33:10,023
I wanted to tell you, you are in great danger.

277
00:33:10,113 --> 00:33:13,151
- I am?
- FranÃ§ois, where's the Chief's report?

278
00:33:13,575 --> 00:33:15,692
- Here.
- There.

279
00:33:15,785 --> 00:33:19,404
You remember the unconscious girl
you saw in the van?

280
00:33:19,915 --> 00:33:21,702
How could I ever forget?

281
00:33:22,375 --> 00:33:25,868
"Beauty too rich for use, for earth too dear!"

282
00:33:26,421 --> 00:33:28,162
Jacques loves poetry.

283
00:33:28,256 --> 00:33:30,999
Yes, I know.
I want you to look at this photograph.

284
00:33:31,092 --> 00:33:33,709
My God, but it is she.
But how did you know?

285
00:33:34,221 --> 00:33:35,632
- A hunch.
- A what?

286
00:33:35,805 --> 00:33:37,262
- Heunch.
- A heunch.

287
00:33:37,599 --> 00:33:40,182
Who is she?
What is she doing in the Chief's file?

288
00:33:40,268 --> 00:33:42,726
- She is Princess Yasmin.
- Princess?

289
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:46,064
Kidnapped? Isn't she beautiful, Mother?

290
00:33:47,067 --> 00:33:48,979
Not bad for a princess.

291
00:33:50,529 --> 00:33:52,737
Commissioner. At ease, Gambrelli.

292
00:33:52,989 --> 00:33:56,232
- I am glad you are not hurt, madame.
- Thank you, Chief.

293
00:33:56,326 --> 00:33:59,069
I'm particularly happy you are still with us,
Commissioner.

294
00:33:59,162 --> 00:34:00,573
I'm sure you are.

295
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:04,365
And I'm particularly happy
that you assigned me Officer Gambrelli.

296
00:34:04,459 --> 00:34:05,575
Really?

297
00:34:05,669 --> 00:34:09,253
Without him, I might have not discovered
the Princess was being held here...

298
00:34:09,339 --> 00:34:10,580
in the South of France.

299
00:34:10,674 --> 00:34:12,415
I'll put out a general alarm immediately.

300
00:34:12,509 --> 00:34:14,876
You will do nothing of the kind
until I give the word.

301
00:34:14,970 --> 00:34:16,256
In the meantime...

302
00:34:16,346 --> 00:34:20,431
Officer Gambrelli's mother
needs a safe place to stay.

303
00:34:20,642 --> 00:34:23,806
As I am going to be here awhile,
she can have my suite at the hotel.

304
00:34:23,895 --> 00:34:25,352
No, but I can't.

305
00:34:25,772 --> 00:34:27,308
But you must, please.

306
00:34:27,857 --> 00:34:30,975
Whatever they need, FranÃ§ois.
Round-the-clock protection, Chief.

307
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:32,560
God bless you.

308
00:34:43,832 --> 00:34:45,039
Get out!

309
00:35:06,855 --> 00:35:07,936
Wait!

310
00:35:09,107 --> 00:35:12,350
I just remembered something
that I forgot to tell the Commissioner.

311
00:35:12,402 --> 00:35:13,859
I will bring the car around.

312
00:35:13,903 --> 00:35:17,863
No, if it's not much trouble, I'd prefer
that you take my mother to the hotel...

313
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:19,736
and then come back for me.

314
00:35:23,204 --> 00:35:24,866
You go that way.

315
00:36:33,983 --> 00:36:36,270
Why don't we just ask for a doctor?

316
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:38,937
Don't worry. We'll find one.

317
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:12,971
Doctor.

318
00:37:16,651 --> 00:37:21,567
If you're looking for a doctor,
I am a very good doctor.

319
00:37:25,368 --> 00:37:26,984
See you in surgery.

320
00:37:31,374 --> 00:37:32,831
Ambulance!

321
00:37:32,876 --> 00:37:34,208
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

322
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:36,581
- Are you a doctor?
- Yes.

323
00:37:36,838 --> 00:37:38,579
I am a very good doctor.

324
00:37:39,507 --> 00:37:41,214
Would you mind coming with us, please?

325
00:37:41,342 --> 00:37:43,334
Oh, I would be delighted.

326
00:38:04,866 --> 00:38:07,358
You are looking as beautiful as ever.

327
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:10,278
And you are still the quintessential flatterer.

328
00:38:14,375 --> 00:38:17,868
We haven't been in this place together for...

329
00:38:18,713 --> 00:38:19,874
how long?

330
00:38:20,381 --> 00:38:21,872
Ten years?

331
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:23,631
At least.

332
00:38:28,056 --> 00:38:30,969
You wanted to see me. Why?

333
00:38:31,810 --> 00:38:34,143
I felt I should lend my support.

334
00:38:34,729 --> 00:38:37,062
That's very considerate of you.

335
00:38:37,106 --> 00:38:41,476
I believe one of the ransom conditions
is that you abdicate your throne.

336
00:38:41,986 --> 00:38:43,318
Yes.

337
00:38:44,113 --> 00:38:45,570
You'd do that?

338
00:38:47,242 --> 00:38:48,904
It is possible...

339
00:38:49,244 --> 00:38:52,578
as long as my successor
is not an army man.

340
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:57,620
Well, I'm here if you need me.

341
00:39:01,422 --> 00:39:02,958
I won't forget that.

342
00:39:11,766 --> 00:39:14,930
Obviously he doesn't have
much faith in the military.

343
00:39:15,812 --> 00:39:19,601
It's just his way of saying
that he knows we're sleeping together.

344
00:39:19,774 --> 00:39:21,811
You think that's all he knows?

345
00:39:23,778 --> 00:39:26,771
Or by now you would be soup
for my supper.

346
00:39:32,453 --> 00:39:33,614
Yes?

347
00:39:36,332 --> 00:39:37,539
The doctor.

348
00:39:39,294 --> 00:39:42,378
Finally. Come in, Doctor.

349
00:39:42,797 --> 00:39:44,459
Yes. Good evening.

350
00:39:44,632 --> 00:39:46,168
Good evening.

351
00:39:48,177 --> 00:39:50,965
What seems to be the trouble?

352
00:39:52,348 --> 00:39:55,637
You have received the blemish in your arm?

353
00:39:55,727 --> 00:39:58,720
Yes. I believe it may require some stitches.

354
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:00,812
What do you think?

355
00:40:02,817 --> 00:40:06,481
Oh, yes. I think you need something...

356
00:40:06,863 --> 00:40:09,071
to keep you from fainting.

357
00:40:09,198 --> 00:40:12,157
You must take deep breaths like this.

358
00:40:14,996 --> 00:40:18,160
You see? Then you don't faint. But deep...

359
00:40:18,499 --> 00:40:20,035
very, very deep.

360
00:40:28,051 --> 00:40:31,089
- What happened?
- You hyperventilated.

361
00:40:31,179 --> 00:40:33,011
I did? Where?

362
00:40:34,349 --> 00:40:36,841
- You fainted.
- Yes, I know.

363
00:40:39,562 --> 00:40:43,397
Well, are you going to stitch up
my arm or not?

364
00:40:43,524 --> 00:40:44,685
Of course.

365
00:40:44,859 --> 00:40:47,067
I am going to stitch up your...

366
00:40:49,364 --> 00:40:50,775
Up your...

367
00:40:50,865 --> 00:40:54,199
But first, I must check...

368
00:40:54,535 --> 00:40:56,197
if you are...

369
00:40:56,579 --> 00:40:59,037
physically fit.

370
00:41:00,208 --> 00:41:03,121
Fit as a fiddle. Very good.

371
00:41:12,637 --> 00:41:14,048
And now...

372
00:41:15,723 --> 00:41:18,431
I must check your reflex.

373
00:41:22,939 --> 00:41:24,896
Flex as a fiddle.

374
00:41:26,234 --> 00:41:27,600
Very good.

375
00:41:52,885 --> 00:41:55,252
It is in here somewhere...

376
00:42:00,101 --> 00:42:03,594
This is very good. You know what this is?
Very good.

377
00:42:04,272 --> 00:42:06,605
My dentist uses this.

378
00:42:06,774 --> 00:42:08,936
He pulled my...

379
00:42:10,445 --> 00:42:13,779
wisdom tooth and I didn't even feel it.

380
00:42:15,074 --> 00:42:17,282
- Novocaine.
- No, no.

381
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:22,613
His name is Fishburn.

382
00:42:25,293 --> 00:42:27,785
Dr. Marvin Fishburn.

383
00:42:29,505 --> 00:42:31,792
I highly recommend him...

384
00:42:32,925 --> 00:42:34,791
if you ever need a...

385
00:42:41,309 --> 00:42:44,768
Seems I have stabbed myself...

386
00:42:45,188 --> 00:42:46,599
in the cheek.

387
00:42:48,149 --> 00:42:52,314
Now, before I can stitch up your arm...

388
00:42:53,613 --> 00:42:56,276
I must inject it.

389
00:42:57,116 --> 00:42:58,652
Hold still.

390
00:43:08,002 --> 00:43:09,288
Very good.

391
00:43:14,133 --> 00:43:15,169
Good.

392
00:43:16,969 --> 00:43:18,961
Now, okay...

393
00:43:23,976 --> 00:43:27,640
It's getting very late...

394
00:43:28,356 --> 00:43:29,688
and I think...

395
00:43:31,526 --> 00:43:33,313
I get back...

396
00:43:33,361 --> 00:43:35,648
in the hospital in surgery.

397
00:43:35,988 --> 00:43:38,150
I am due in surgery.

398
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:40,986
Bye-bye.

399
00:43:45,373 --> 00:43:47,831
On second thought...

400
00:43:48,543 --> 00:43:50,876
I am in no condition...

401
00:43:51,003 --> 00:43:52,335
to operate.

402
00:43:53,005 --> 00:43:56,840
It's better if I stay here, huh?

403
00:43:57,426 --> 00:43:58,667
With you.

404
00:43:59,345 --> 00:44:03,055
If you need me, I am here with you.

405
00:44:03,683 --> 00:44:05,049
I am here.

406
00:44:05,726 --> 00:44:08,059
Now, just relax.

407
00:44:08,729 --> 00:44:10,265
If you need me...

408
00:44:11,357 --> 00:44:14,395
We have run into a slight complication...

409
00:44:14,861 --> 00:44:18,195
which makes it impractical for us
to stay here any longer.

410
00:44:19,407 --> 00:44:23,242
Yes. If all goes well, we should be in Darfur
by tomorrow afternoon.

411
00:44:45,558 --> 00:44:48,801
"But, soft!

412
00:44:48,978 --> 00:44:53,894
"what light through yonder window breaks?

413
00:44:54,650 --> 00:44:59,770
"It is the east, and Juliet is the sun!"

414
00:45:05,661 --> 00:45:10,247
- Romeo?
- No, Jacques.

415
00:45:10,416 --> 00:45:12,908
- You know what they say.
- No.

416
00:45:14,295 --> 00:45:16,753
"A rose by any other name..."

417
00:45:16,797 --> 00:45:19,130
"Would smell as sweet."

418
00:45:19,967 --> 00:45:21,253
Yes.

419
00:45:23,596 --> 00:45:27,966
- What are you doing here, sweetie?
- I came to rescue you.

420
00:45:28,309 --> 00:45:30,767
- Hold your breath.
- My breath?

421
00:45:36,108 --> 00:45:38,350
- Longer.
- I can't.

422
00:45:39,195 --> 00:45:40,982
Well, try again. Look...

423
00:45:54,627 --> 00:45:55,993
It's no use.

424
00:45:59,465 --> 00:46:01,673
There is one other way. Okay?

425
00:46:01,884 --> 00:46:05,969
It's a little extreme, but it always works.

426
00:46:17,650 --> 00:46:19,516
- Hello?
- Did I wake you?

427
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:22,356
No.

428
00:46:23,489 --> 00:46:24,696
Are you alone?

429
00:46:24,865 --> 00:46:28,825
- No. I am in bed with a beautiful woman.
- Don't tease me.

430
00:46:29,412 --> 00:46:30,823
Even in fun.

431
00:46:31,747 --> 00:46:34,080
I just spoke to our friend in France.

432
00:46:34,750 --> 00:46:38,209
Something has come up
and he plans to visit Uncle Idris.

433
00:46:38,546 --> 00:46:39,662
So soon?

434
00:46:39,714 --> 00:46:42,001
Evidently he had no alternative.

435
00:46:42,383 --> 00:46:45,501
Rumor has it that the King
is returning to the city tomorrow.

436
00:46:45,553 --> 00:46:46,669
Good.

437
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:51,515
This place is getting a little too close
to Uncle Idris for comfort.

438
00:46:52,226 --> 00:46:54,684
- Will I see you tomorrow?
- Of course.

439
00:46:55,229 --> 00:46:56,561
Good night.

440
00:47:00,276 --> 00:47:02,939
- No more hiccups.
- Amazing.

441
00:47:03,571 --> 00:47:05,528
But how did you discover it?

442
00:47:06,115 --> 00:47:10,234
I was engaged to a football player
when I was in college in the States...

443
00:47:10,369 --> 00:47:13,362
and he always had the hiccups.

444
00:47:13,414 --> 00:47:15,121
Who could blame him?

445
00:47:15,916 --> 00:47:17,248
How about you?

446
00:47:18,377 --> 00:47:21,370
- I never have hiccups.
- Oh, never?

447
00:47:22,214 --> 00:47:25,127
But if I ever do, I hope you are
somewhere in the neighborhood.

448
00:47:25,259 --> 00:47:29,094
I would consider it an honor and privilege
to be of assistance.

449
00:47:32,641 --> 00:47:35,554
How long have you been a policeman,
Officer Gambrelli?

450
00:47:35,603 --> 00:47:37,811
- Over three years next May.
- Yes?

451
00:47:38,564 --> 00:47:41,227
How long have you been a Princess,
Your Highness?

452
00:47:41,275 --> 00:47:45,235
- All my life.
- That's a long time to be anything.

453
00:47:45,404 --> 00:47:46,440
Yes.

454
00:47:48,282 --> 00:47:49,818
Do you like being a cop?

455
00:47:49,950 --> 00:47:53,114
Yes, sometimes. How is it being a princess?

456
00:47:54,246 --> 00:47:57,410
- It is not much fun.
- Oh, fun is important.

457
00:47:57,500 --> 00:47:58,616
Yes.

458
00:47:59,919 --> 00:48:02,161
What else is important to you?

459
00:48:04,090 --> 00:48:06,082
- Singing.
- Yes?

460
00:48:16,352 --> 00:48:19,220
- That's terrible.
- Yes.

461
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:21,141
And poetry.

462
00:48:21,315 --> 00:48:23,853
"Parent of golden dreams, Romance!

463
00:48:23,984 --> 00:48:26,852
"Auspicious queen of childish joys"

464
00:48:26,987 --> 00:48:29,479
"Who lead'st along, in airy dance"

465
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:31,823
- That's Byron.
- Yes.

466
00:48:34,703 --> 00:48:36,160
- And the rain.
- Yes.

467
00:48:36,497 --> 00:48:40,992
And sleeping. And my mother.

468
00:48:41,168 --> 00:48:43,535
- You like your mother?
- Yes. Very much.

469
00:48:44,713 --> 00:48:47,672
- And women.
- Your kinds of women?

470
00:48:47,842 --> 00:48:49,049
Oh, all kinds.

471
00:48:49,844 --> 00:48:54,088
Especially dark women with blue eyes...

472
00:48:55,015 --> 00:48:56,677
and full red lips...

473
00:48:57,893 --> 00:49:00,761
who smell like night-blooming jasmine...

474
00:49:01,689 --> 00:49:05,182
and taste like a warm mango.

475
00:49:06,527 --> 00:49:08,109
Warm mango?

476
00:49:09,029 --> 00:49:12,238
- And honey.
- Oh, my God.

477
00:49:12,867 --> 00:49:14,028
Mine, too.

478
00:49:28,215 --> 00:49:29,877
Playing doctor?

479
00:49:31,886 --> 00:49:33,923
We're all going on a little trip...

480
00:49:34,054 --> 00:49:37,968
and I think you'll be more comfortable
if you sleep throughout the journey.

481
00:49:38,058 --> 00:49:40,391
Touch her, and you will answer to me.

482
00:49:49,737 --> 00:49:50,898
Easy, easy.

483
00:50:07,421 --> 00:50:09,788
There will be nothing left of him
when that goes off.

484
00:50:09,924 --> 00:50:11,586
He is coming out of it.

485
00:50:12,927 --> 00:50:13,963
Let's go.

486
00:50:39,954 --> 00:50:42,196
You're driving too fast.

487
00:51:05,646 --> 00:51:06,807
Oh, Mother.

488
00:51:06,981 --> 00:51:08,973
Jacques, I was so worried.

489
00:51:11,735 --> 00:51:15,319
- The Princess, they have taken the Princess.
- Please, Jacques.

490
00:51:15,698 --> 00:51:17,234
I have to stop them.

491
00:51:19,994 --> 00:51:22,657
You see? You are not supposed to get up.

492
00:51:22,830 --> 00:51:25,493
I must tell the Commissioner
about Uncle Idris.

493
00:51:25,541 --> 00:51:28,329
I will tell the Commissioner
about Uncle Idris.

494
00:51:28,419 --> 00:51:32,333
- Who is Uncle Idris?
- Uncle Idris? I don't know.

495
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:35,332
I remember he is someone...

496
00:51:35,426 --> 00:51:38,715
that they were going to Darfur
to visit Uncle Idris.

497
00:51:40,514 --> 00:51:43,257
- Just keep quiet.
- Uncle Idris.

498
00:52:06,206 --> 00:52:09,699
- They said he was in Room 408.
- I'll check.

499
00:52:13,881 --> 00:52:15,042
Hello?

500
00:52:18,260 --> 00:52:19,717
How is he?

501
00:52:21,055 --> 00:52:24,048
It was all I could do
to keep Jacques from getting out of bed...

502
00:52:24,099 --> 00:52:27,592
and coming here to tell you
about someone named Uncle Idris.

503
00:52:27,895 --> 00:52:29,056
Idris?

504
00:52:29,104 --> 00:52:32,438
He said he overheard someone say
they were going to Darfur.

505
00:52:32,566 --> 00:52:36,480
Darfur. That's a small military republic
that borders Lugash.

506
00:52:38,947 --> 00:52:41,234
- Charles.
- Yes, Maria?

507
00:52:42,951 --> 00:52:44,613
I'm worried about Jacques.

508
00:52:44,745 --> 00:52:46,077
There, there.

509
00:52:46,246 --> 00:52:49,956
If he's anything like his father,
he'll be all right. He'll manage.

510
00:52:50,084 --> 00:52:53,418
But that's the trouble.
He's too much like his father.

511
00:52:54,254 --> 00:52:58,840
That's why I disappeared, came here, and
encouraged him to be a musician or a poet.

512
00:52:58,967 --> 00:53:02,927
But in spite of everything
he was determined to be a policeman.

513
00:53:04,765 --> 00:53:07,178
Can you protect him, Charles?

514
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:11,978
Soon I must tell him who his father was.

515
00:53:12,106 --> 00:53:15,144
His father, yes, was an idiot.

516
00:53:15,275 --> 00:53:17,358
- I mean...
- Yes, but I can't tell him that.

517
00:53:17,444 --> 00:53:19,151
No, of course you can't.

518
00:53:21,281 --> 00:53:23,944
Clouseau has always been his hero.

519
00:53:24,785 --> 00:53:28,620
Can you imagine if you longed
to be a great fisherman...

520
00:53:28,956 --> 00:53:32,620
and you suddenly discovered
that your father was Captain Ahab?

521
00:53:34,294 --> 00:53:36,707
Come. Sit here. Tell me...

522
00:53:37,631 --> 00:53:39,623
you and Clouseau...

523
00:53:41,844 --> 00:53:43,301
I was very young.

524
00:53:43,387 --> 00:53:47,301
I know. But I still don't understand.
You, such a beautiful woman...

525
00:53:50,227 --> 00:53:52,970
We were caught in a snowstorm.

526
00:53:53,021 --> 00:53:56,139
I knew we would freeze to death
unless we kept moving.

527
00:53:56,233 --> 00:54:00,193
He said the Alaskan Indians
kept from freezing to death by making love.

528
00:54:00,821 --> 00:54:03,734
I was young. I wanted to live.

529
00:54:04,658 --> 00:54:06,570
I hope you are not offended.

530
00:54:08,328 --> 00:54:09,489
No.

531
00:54:09,830 --> 00:54:12,072
It's just too bad you didn't have...

532
00:54:12,166 --> 00:54:16,035
a stationary bicycle,
or a rowing machine or something.

533
00:54:16,211 --> 00:54:19,329
- But then I would not have had Jacques.
- Exactly.

534
00:54:20,591 --> 00:54:23,334
Of course, that would have been a pity.

535
00:54:24,094 --> 00:54:25,175
Tell me.

536
00:54:25,679 --> 00:54:30,014
Don't you think it would be best
if you told him about his father now...

537
00:54:31,268 --> 00:54:34,352
rather than have him
find out for himself later on?

538
00:54:38,025 --> 00:54:40,768
Yes, I suppose you are right.

539
00:54:57,711 --> 00:54:58,747
Yes?

540
00:55:02,299 --> 00:55:05,133
Wow, Chief, you look a bit frazzled.

541
00:55:06,094 --> 00:55:07,210
Why not?

542
00:55:08,222 --> 00:55:11,215
Officer Gambrelli just pushed me
out of the window.

543
00:55:12,726 --> 00:55:16,219
Fortunately, I held on to the telephone.

544
00:55:18,565 --> 00:55:20,773
And to make matters worse...

545
00:55:21,401 --> 00:55:24,064
Officer Gambrelli won't tell me anything...

546
00:55:24,238 --> 00:55:26,230
until he's cleared it with you.

547
00:55:27,616 --> 00:55:31,075
Now, you may be in charge
of this case, Commissioner...

548
00:55:31,453 --> 00:55:33,945
but I am Chief of Police here.

549
00:55:34,331 --> 00:55:38,245
And as long as Officer Gambrelli
is on my force...

550
00:55:38,919 --> 00:55:41,787
I expect him to report his condition
when asked...

551
00:55:42,130 --> 00:55:45,749
without your official permission or blessing!

552
00:55:46,093 --> 00:55:49,803
And I always knew
you were a pompous pissant!

553
00:55:57,104 --> 00:55:58,345
Commissioner.

554
00:56:05,445 --> 00:56:06,777
Help!

555
00:56:16,290 --> 00:56:19,078
Clouseau. My father.

556
00:56:19,793 --> 00:56:20,954
Yes.

557
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:23,786
But why didn't you tell me?

558
00:56:25,048 --> 00:56:27,631
For the same reason I didn't tell him.

559
00:56:27,801 --> 00:56:30,965
I thought you would both be
better off not knowing.

560
00:56:31,221 --> 00:56:33,634
Your father and I weren't in love.

561
00:56:34,474 --> 00:56:37,933
We had a brief encounter in a blizzard.

562
00:56:38,770 --> 00:56:42,889
Why did you pretend that my father
was an Italian French horn player?

563
00:56:43,150 --> 00:56:46,643
Well, for one thing,
it explained your interest in music.

564
00:56:46,987 --> 00:56:49,274
Actually, Clouseau played the violin.

565
00:56:49,740 --> 00:56:52,323
Not well, but passionately.

566
00:56:53,160 --> 00:56:55,402
He made love the way he played the violin.

567
00:56:55,495 --> 00:56:57,407
But why do you tell me now?

568
00:56:58,123 --> 00:57:00,831
Because in many ways,
you are like your father.

569
00:57:01,460 --> 00:57:04,999
Foolhardy, accident-prone, pig-headed...

570
00:57:05,297 --> 00:57:07,789
courageous, accident-prone...

571
00:57:08,842 --> 00:57:13,507
I think it's important that you learn about
the things he depended on to stay alive.

572
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:18,175
Also the things he neglected
to pay attention to that ultimately killed him.

573
00:57:19,811 --> 00:57:24,306
"If I must die,
I will encounter darkness as a bride...

574
00:57:24,483 --> 00:57:26,770
"And hug it in mine arms."

575
00:57:27,486 --> 00:57:29,273
- Shakespeare?
- Yes.

576
00:57:32,115 --> 00:57:35,358
Excuse me.
I felt sure you would want to be told.

577
00:57:35,827 --> 00:57:39,616
Chief Lazar and the Commissioner
have been taken to Intensive Care.

578
00:57:49,383 --> 00:57:51,375
- Have you told him?
- Yes.

579
00:57:52,052 --> 00:57:55,295
- Gendarme Second Class Gambrelli.
- Yes?

580
00:57:55,889 --> 00:57:58,302
It looks like you are in charge now.

581
00:57:58,684 --> 00:58:00,016
- Yes?
- No.

582
00:58:00,310 --> 00:58:02,393
Time is running out for the Princess.

583
00:58:02,479 --> 00:58:05,222
And apart from myself and FranÃ§ois...

584
00:58:05,357 --> 00:58:09,317
Officer Gambrelli is the only one
who can identify the kidnappers.

585
00:58:09,903 --> 00:58:12,486
But he has so little experience.

586
00:58:13,156 --> 00:58:15,239
His father was a patrolman...

587
00:58:15,325 --> 00:58:19,660
and became the greatest detective in France
without any experience.

588
00:58:19,746 --> 00:58:23,990
Trust me. If you are a Clouseau,
you can succeed without it.

589
00:58:24,876 --> 00:58:27,584
I presume you will now change your name?

590
00:58:27,879 --> 00:58:28,995
Why?

591
00:58:29,089 --> 00:58:30,500
You are a Clouseau now.

592
00:58:30,590 --> 00:58:33,833
Yes, but I am also a Gambrelli.
It's a good name.

593
00:58:36,596 --> 00:58:39,259
You can sing it.
Do you want me to change it?

594
00:58:39,349 --> 00:58:42,763
It might be nice. Your father saved my life.

595
00:58:45,731 --> 00:58:47,393
Not bad. Okay.

596
00:58:47,941 --> 00:58:52,732
FranÃ§ois, see to it that Gendarme
Second Class Jacques Gambrelli...

597
00:58:53,113 --> 00:58:56,606
is promoted to Detective First Class
Jacques Clouseau, Jr...

598
00:58:56,700 --> 00:58:58,066
as quickly as you can.

599
00:58:58,118 --> 00:59:00,861
Get him new papers and a passport.

600
00:59:01,121 --> 00:59:04,205
Don't worry, Maria.
When the kidnappers hear...

601
00:59:04,291 --> 00:59:06,533
that a Clouseau is on their trail...

602
00:59:06,793 --> 00:59:09,410
they'll probably surrender without a fight.

603
00:59:10,589 --> 00:59:11,705
Shut up!

604
00:59:13,091 --> 00:59:14,298
Salute.

605
00:59:30,067 --> 00:59:32,400
- Hello?
- Hello!

606
00:59:35,238 --> 00:59:38,447
- Dr. Balls?
- Who wants to know?

607
00:59:40,243 --> 00:59:42,485
Detective Jacques Clouseau.

608
00:59:42,746 --> 00:59:46,080
Second... First Class, Junior.

609
00:59:47,167 --> 00:59:49,500
I spoke with you on the phone earlier.

610
00:59:54,174 --> 00:59:57,588
- Good evening.
- I am Madame Balls.

611
01:00:02,307 --> 01:00:04,094
You don't look like him.

612
01:00:04,601 --> 01:00:07,184
I wouldn't know.
I've never met your husband.

613
01:00:07,354 --> 01:00:09,437
Who said anything about my husband?

614
01:00:09,523 --> 01:00:11,685
You did. You said I don't look like him.

615
01:00:11,817 --> 01:00:13,353
I meant your father!

616
01:00:13,485 --> 01:00:16,523
Why didn't you say so?
I have never met him, either.

617
01:00:18,532 --> 01:00:21,024
He's a real Clouseau.

618
01:00:22,035 --> 01:00:25,528
- Detective Clouseau.
- First Class, Junior.

619
01:00:25,997 --> 01:00:27,033
Naturally.

620
01:00:27,791 --> 01:00:31,705
Dr. Auguste Balls of Nice at your service.

621
01:00:34,548 --> 01:00:39,043
You must forgive me for having
Madame Balls establish your authenticity.

622
01:00:39,719 --> 01:00:42,006
So many crooks and charlatans these days...

623
01:00:42,055 --> 01:00:44,718
who would use my talents...

624
01:00:44,808 --> 01:00:47,801
for ill-gotten gains. You can't be too careful.

625
01:00:48,895 --> 01:00:50,887
- Am I forgiven?
- Yes.

626
01:00:51,398 --> 01:00:52,889
Such a joy...

627
01:00:53,024 --> 01:00:57,735
to see the son of my oldest, dearest,
and deadest friend.

628
01:00:58,905 --> 01:01:02,364
And as I always used to say to him,
always remember...

629
01:01:02,701 --> 01:01:05,239
if you need a disguise when duty calls...

630
01:01:05,412 --> 01:01:09,201
look no further because you've got Balls.

631
01:01:10,584 --> 01:01:12,746
- Did you make that up?
- No.

632
01:01:12,919 --> 01:01:15,832
My genius lies in the art of transfiguration.

633
01:01:15,922 --> 01:01:19,586
My wife is the Emily BrontÃ«
of the Balls family.

634
01:01:21,887 --> 01:01:23,253
Congratulations.

635
01:01:23,763 --> 01:01:26,255
I am a bit of a poet myself.

636
01:01:26,766 --> 01:01:31,056
You and Marta must get together sometime
and whip up a few sonnets.

637
01:01:32,898 --> 01:01:36,517
She also makes the most delicious borscht.

638
01:01:37,194 --> 01:01:40,858
Now, specifically, how can I help...

639
01:01:41,448 --> 01:01:46,193
the son of my nearest, dearest,
and deadest customer?

640
01:01:47,037 --> 01:01:50,951
I must get into Lugash
without being recognized.

641
01:01:51,291 --> 01:01:52,623
Say no more.

642
01:02:00,759 --> 01:02:01,920
Marta!

643
01:02:06,056 --> 01:02:07,592
Hello.

644
01:02:10,894 --> 01:02:15,104
Bring me the plans
of the inconspicuous Bedouin beggar...

645
01:02:15,899 --> 01:02:17,140
number two.

646
01:03:01,194 --> 01:03:02,480
Wait here.

647
01:04:18,063 --> 01:04:20,931
Is that why you asked me
to meet you in the park?

648
01:04:22,233 --> 01:04:25,522
So you could attack me
like you used to attack my father?

649
01:04:25,612 --> 01:04:26,898
Yes.

650
01:04:26,946 --> 01:04:30,735
I can honestly say that your father
would have been dead many times...

651
01:04:30,784 --> 01:04:35,529
if it weren't for my surprise attacks keeping
him on his toes, alert to every danger.

652
01:04:35,955 --> 01:04:40,450
So I am available, in case you're considering
hiring me in the same capacity...

653
01:04:40,585 --> 01:04:42,622
that I once served your father.

654
01:04:44,756 --> 01:04:46,372
Have a fortune cookie.

655
01:04:53,807 --> 01:04:55,218
What does it say?

656
01:04:56,393 --> 01:04:59,227
"You will hire an Oriental family friend."

657
01:05:00,313 --> 01:05:01,429
Amazing.

658
01:05:01,481 --> 01:05:03,723
His plane to Lugash is on schedule.

659
01:05:03,817 --> 01:05:05,149
He will be met at the airport...

660
01:05:05,276 --> 01:05:09,145
and taken to the hotel, where
he will be contacted by one of our agents.

661
01:05:09,280 --> 01:05:12,899
We interrupt this broadcast
to bring you an important news flash.

662
01:05:12,992 --> 01:05:15,575
A breaking story out of Nice reveals...

663
01:05:15,829 --> 01:05:17,946
that Clouseau may have had a son.

664
01:05:18,915 --> 01:05:21,749
An anonymous phone caller
has stated that...

665
01:05:22,293 --> 01:05:25,912
Gendarme Second Class Jacques Gambrelli
was in fact...

666
01:05:26,506 --> 01:05:30,591
First Class Detective Jacques Clouseau
of the Nice Police Force.

667
01:05:31,344 --> 01:05:34,132
Charles, have you seen the morning paper?

668
01:05:55,034 --> 01:05:59,028
He's being met by a French agent
posing as a limo driver.

669
01:06:05,378 --> 01:06:06,619
Mr. Gambrelli?

670
01:06:07,547 --> 01:06:08,958
- Oui.
- Me, too.

671
01:06:10,675 --> 01:06:12,541
- Mr. Gambrelli.
- Yes?

672
01:06:13,052 --> 01:06:17,012
I have to take you to your hotel room.
There is no need to register.

673
01:06:17,056 --> 01:06:20,640
Just go straight up to the room
and wait for a call...

674
01:06:21,853 --> 01:06:23,060
from Mr. Wasim.

675
01:06:23,396 --> 01:06:25,308
- Who?
- Mr. Wasim.

676
01:06:26,816 --> 01:06:28,227
This way, please.

677
01:06:31,070 --> 01:06:33,562
The son of France's greatest detective...

678
01:06:34,866 --> 01:06:38,155
undoubtedly a talented police officer
in his own right...

679
01:06:39,579 --> 01:06:40,740
from Nice...

680
01:06:41,581 --> 01:06:43,072
arrives in Lugash.

681
01:06:44,584 --> 01:06:46,416
It can mean only one thing.

682
01:06:47,003 --> 01:06:48,835
Will this change our plans?

683
01:06:49,088 --> 01:06:50,499
I don't think so.

684
01:06:52,258 --> 01:06:55,001
We have always known
that if we were discovered...

685
01:06:55,094 --> 01:06:58,258
we risked reprisal
from our unstable neighbor.

686
01:06:58,890 --> 01:07:00,756
It may well be that the son...

687
01:07:00,892 --> 01:07:04,602
of France's greatest detective
can insure us against that discovery.

688
01:07:04,729 --> 01:07:08,097
- How can he do that?
- By eliminating Uncle Idris.

689
01:07:08,441 --> 01:07:10,603
Or at least taking credit for it.

690
01:07:10,902 --> 01:07:12,438
For the time being, at least...

691
01:07:12,529 --> 01:07:16,899
make sure that Detective Clouseau, Jr,
is well protected.

692
01:07:33,967 --> 01:07:35,128
Your Highness.

693
01:07:36,135 --> 01:07:38,798
Please, put your legs around my waist.

694
01:07:39,097 --> 01:07:40,383
In your dreams.

695
01:07:40,890 --> 01:07:42,927
As you wish, Your Highness.

696
01:07:43,059 --> 01:07:44,470
What are you doing?

697
01:07:44,602 --> 01:07:45,718
Don't!

698
01:07:46,604 --> 01:07:49,312
- You can't take me down!
- Here we go!

699
01:07:50,733 --> 01:07:53,976
Geronimo!

700
01:07:59,075 --> 01:08:01,909
You let me jump out of that plane
without a parachute!

701
01:08:01,995 --> 01:08:05,238
Your Highness, if you don't stop hitting me,
I'm going to drop you.

702
01:08:05,331 --> 01:08:06,447
Really?

703
01:08:06,499 --> 01:08:09,412
You wouldn't dare.
I am your ticket to paradise.

704
01:08:25,977 --> 01:08:27,468
Mr. Gambrelli's room.

705
01:08:28,813 --> 01:08:31,430
- For you. It's Mr. Wasim.
- Thank you.

706
01:08:33,610 --> 01:08:34,691
Hello?

707
01:08:34,819 --> 01:08:37,857
Meet me at Omar's Oasis at 10:00.

708
01:08:38,823 --> 01:08:40,860
I'll be wearing a red carnation.

709
01:09:15,401 --> 01:09:17,984
Welcome to my home away from home,
Your Highness.

710
01:09:18,071 --> 01:09:19,187
Who are you?

711
01:09:19,238 --> 01:09:22,982
My Muslim name is
Sheikh Latifa Abdullah Idris Al-Sabah...

712
01:09:23,660 --> 01:09:25,743
but you can call me Uncle Idris.

713
01:09:26,496 --> 01:09:28,704
But what is wrong with my disguise?

714
01:09:28,873 --> 01:09:31,911
Dr. Balls said it was
his most original creation.

715
01:09:40,593 --> 01:09:42,084
Mr. Gambrelli's room.

716
01:09:43,846 --> 01:09:46,554
- It's Commissioner Dreyfus.
- Coming.

717
01:09:50,269 --> 01:09:52,852
Pass me the phone. Hello?

718
01:09:56,192 --> 01:09:57,273
Hello?

719
01:09:58,528 --> 01:10:00,110
Wait! Hello!

720
01:10:02,532 --> 01:10:05,195
Hello, Jacques. Where are you?

721
01:10:12,458 --> 01:10:13,915
What's happening?

722
01:10:15,378 --> 01:10:17,711
- Is that you, Commissioner?
- Yes.

723
01:10:17,964 --> 01:10:19,796
I'm sorry to do this...

724
01:10:19,966 --> 01:10:23,380
but I want you to pack your bags
and catch the next plane home.

725
01:10:23,469 --> 01:10:24,585
What?

726
01:10:24,637 --> 01:10:27,630
You've become a political hot potato.

727
01:10:27,807 --> 01:10:30,220
The French government can't protect you.

728
01:10:30,309 --> 01:10:31,800
But what about the Princess?

729
01:10:31,936 --> 01:10:34,599
Officially, she is not your concern anymore.

730
01:10:36,274 --> 01:10:37,981
Maybe not officially...

731
01:10:38,067 --> 01:10:40,901
but unofficially,
she will always be my concern.

732
01:10:44,157 --> 01:10:46,319
I think I'll come with you anyway.

733
01:10:46,826 --> 01:10:47,942
No, Cato.

734
01:10:48,619 --> 01:10:50,576
One hot potato is too much.

735
01:12:12,245 --> 01:12:14,908
It is. Is it? You are...

736
01:12:16,082 --> 01:12:17,664
I hate to make a bother...

737
01:12:17,750 --> 01:12:20,163
but would you give for me, please,
your autograph?

738
01:12:20,253 --> 01:12:21,334
What?

739
01:12:22,171 --> 01:12:24,754
I do not have the pen. Do you have the pen?

740
01:12:26,092 --> 01:12:27,583
Anyone have a pen?

741
01:12:33,224 --> 01:12:36,592
You write, "To Wafiyyah."

742
01:12:36,727 --> 01:12:38,434
Yes, but I don't have any paper.

743
01:12:38,521 --> 01:12:40,934
Not on paper. Here.

744
01:12:41,941 --> 01:12:45,901
- There?
- Yes, for my girlfriend, hurry.

745
01:12:48,739 --> 01:12:52,949
Quickly. I must finish dance
or Omar will cut off my nipples.

746
01:12:54,620 --> 01:12:56,282
What is this?

747
01:12:57,123 --> 01:12:58,614
- Gambrelli?
- Yes.

748
01:12:58,791 --> 01:13:00,783
No, Clouseau.

749
01:13:01,043 --> 01:13:03,706
I see your picture. Very beautiful.

750
01:13:03,796 --> 01:13:05,287
Big smile.

751
01:13:05,965 --> 01:13:07,297
Could this be Omar?

752
01:13:07,383 --> 01:13:10,126
Omar! Hit it, Muffid.

753
01:13:27,236 --> 01:13:28,317
Excuse me.

754
01:13:38,748 --> 01:13:40,330
Where is the Princess?

755
01:13:40,416 --> 01:13:42,658
Not far away from here.
I can take you to her.

756
01:13:42,752 --> 01:13:45,836
- But we have not much time.
- Why? What time is it now?

757
01:13:46,797 --> 01:13:48,004
3:15.

758
01:13:59,518 --> 01:14:00,850
My nose.

759
01:14:05,691 --> 01:14:07,307
Excuse me.

760
01:14:08,152 --> 01:14:09,438
Thank you.

761
01:14:15,993 --> 01:14:18,360
They were going to kill you. Follow me.

762
01:14:30,549 --> 01:14:33,041
Wafiyyah! That's him! Clouseau!

763
01:14:41,560 --> 01:14:42,721
Pervert!

764
01:14:56,701 --> 01:14:58,237
This way. The kitchen.

765
01:15:00,371 --> 01:15:01,657
In here.

766
01:15:22,852 --> 01:15:24,263
Come! This way!

767
01:15:24,353 --> 01:15:26,436
Not until you tell me who you are.

768
01:15:26,522 --> 01:15:28,764
Col. Al-Durai, Lugash Special Services.

769
01:15:28,858 --> 01:15:32,067
- I'm here to help you rescue the Princess.
- Where is the Princess?

770
01:15:32,111 --> 01:15:36,776
She's being held in a desert hideout about
20 kilometers northeast of Ksar El Kebir.

771
01:15:36,949 --> 01:15:40,283
You didn't tell me
it was going to be like this. I am ruined.

772
01:15:40,411 --> 01:15:43,028
I didn't know it would be like this.
You'll be compensated.

773
01:15:43,122 --> 01:15:44,454
- Where is your car?
- Over there.

774
01:15:44,540 --> 01:15:46,122
Everyone, in the car!

775
01:15:52,631 --> 01:15:55,465
Cato! Here!

776
01:16:04,143 --> 01:16:06,977
- Where is Gambrelli?
- Hopefully, gone to rescue the Princess.

777
01:16:07,104 --> 01:16:09,642
- Where are we going?
- To make sure he does.

778
01:16:16,822 --> 01:16:19,109
Get out and see what that sign says.

779
01:16:26,415 --> 01:16:28,577
It says Ksar El Kebir...

780
01:16:28,834 --> 01:16:32,248
175 kilometers. Is that where we're going?

781
01:16:32,421 --> 01:16:34,663
No. That is where I'm going.

782
01:16:34,799 --> 01:16:36,131
Bye, Cato.

783
01:16:49,688 --> 01:16:51,429
Get in, Rabbi.

784
01:16:58,364 --> 01:16:59,696
Remember, men...

785
01:16:59,865 --> 01:17:04,451
it is a diplomatic imperative that Clouseau
gets credit for rescuing the Princess.

786
01:17:04,870 --> 01:17:05,951
Good luck.

787
01:17:06,539 --> 01:17:08,155
Gentlemen, after you.

788
01:17:08,541 --> 01:17:10,533
Me? I am not going.

789
01:17:11,544 --> 01:17:12,705
Me, neither.

790
01:17:12,878 --> 01:17:16,542
- In that case, take them out and shoot them.
- I changed my mind.

791
01:17:17,967 --> 01:17:19,503
Save me a seat!

792
01:17:37,486 --> 01:17:38,567
Excuse me.

793
01:17:39,530 --> 01:17:41,863
- Do you know which way is north?
- Yes.

794
01:19:05,991 --> 01:19:08,483
Yussa, get her.

795
01:19:27,346 --> 01:19:29,929
Come with me. There is a way out of here.

796
01:19:30,015 --> 01:19:32,098
That's fine, but she's not going with us.

797
01:19:32,184 --> 01:19:34,927
Don't be foolish. She is our ticket to escape.

798
01:19:41,944 --> 01:19:43,606
Go ahead. Shoot me.

799
01:19:43,696 --> 01:19:46,609
I will. Unless you can stop me.

800
01:19:51,620 --> 01:19:52,701
Let's see.

801
01:20:19,857 --> 01:20:21,064
Here.

802
01:20:22,067 --> 01:20:23,558
You need some help.

803
01:21:23,879 --> 01:21:24,960
Drop it.

804
01:21:25,798 --> 01:21:28,290
Hello, sailor. Drop it.

805
01:22:51,633 --> 01:22:52,874
That felt good!

806
01:22:55,179 --> 01:22:56,340
Come, liebchen.

807
01:22:56,388 --> 01:22:58,220
- Never!
- We make our escape.

808
01:23:00,851 --> 01:23:03,639
"When I am dead, my dearest

809
01:23:04,354 --> 01:23:06,812
"Sing no sad songs for me

810
01:23:07,191 --> 01:23:09,854
"Plant thou no roses at my head

811
01:23:10,194 --> 01:23:12,151
"Nor shady cypress tree

812
01:23:13,071 --> 01:23:15,358
"Be the green grass above me

813
01:23:15,532 --> 01:23:17,899
"With showers and dewdrops wet

814
01:23:18,327 --> 01:23:20,239
"And if thou wilt, remember

815
01:23:20,412 --> 01:23:22,870
"And if thou wilt, forget"

816
01:23:32,758 --> 01:23:35,876
That's it. No more Mr. Nice Guy.

817
01:23:38,847 --> 01:23:41,885
Yesterday morning,
Princess Yasmin of Lugash...

818
01:23:42,059 --> 01:23:45,848
was rescued from her kidnappers
by Detective Inspector First Class...

819
01:23:45,938 --> 01:23:47,725
Jacques Clouseau, Jr...

820
01:23:48,106 --> 01:23:50,439
the son of France's greatest detective.

821
01:23:50,526 --> 01:23:53,894
As for Detective First Class
Inspector Clouseau, Jr...

822
01:23:54,279 --> 01:23:56,942
the latest medical bulletin has him
doing well...

823
01:23:57,032 --> 01:24:01,117
and his doctor expects him to be back
on duty in a matter of a few weeks.

824
01:24:01,245 --> 01:24:03,111
- Sooner.
- Hello.

825
01:24:05,916 --> 01:24:07,782
- You are looking better.
- Thank you.

826
01:24:07,918 --> 01:24:10,911
Darling, Charles and I
have something to tell you.

827
01:24:11,296 --> 01:24:14,130
- You are getting married.
- How did you know?

828
01:24:15,133 --> 01:24:17,466
I know because I am a great detective.

829
01:24:18,220 --> 01:24:20,553
Right, Dad?

830
01:24:33,819 --> 01:24:34,980
Who was that?

831
01:24:51,336 --> 01:24:52,497
To you.

832
01:24:57,342 --> 01:24:58,833
What are you doing?

833
01:25:02,639 --> 01:25:04,346
You silly boy.

834
01:25:04,433 --> 01:25:06,595
Bouquet. Throw the bouquet.

835
01:25:19,364 --> 01:25:21,481
- Forgive me.
- Jacqueline.

836
01:25:21,533 --> 01:25:23,695
- I'm sorry I'm late, Mama.
- Jacqueline!

837
01:25:23,827 --> 01:25:26,535
- Jacques, brother!
- Sister.

838
01:25:27,998 --> 01:25:29,114
Mama?

839
01:25:29,207 --> 01:25:31,164
Charles, your head is bleeding.

840
01:25:31,209 --> 01:25:33,292
Yes, you have received a beump.

841
01:25:34,838 --> 01:25:35,874
Beump?

842
01:25:38,008 --> 01:25:39,044
Maria.

843
01:25:39,843 --> 01:25:42,210
Charles, I planned to tell you.

844
01:25:42,679 --> 01:25:43,840
I had twins.

845
01:26:26,848 --> 01:26:27,929
Thank you.

846
01:26:43,448 --> 01:26:46,031
You must be very proud.

847
01:26:46,284 --> 01:26:47,445
Thank you.

848
01:27:09,975 --> 01:27:11,432
You are adorable.

849
01:28:11,745 --> 01:28:13,862
That felt good!
