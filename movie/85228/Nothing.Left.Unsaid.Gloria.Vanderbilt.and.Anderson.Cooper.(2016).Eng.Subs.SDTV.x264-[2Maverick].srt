      <i> the public face is.</i>      

72

    who named my dream boxes,   

86
00:06:29,322 --> 00:06:33,324
     and she's always great     
    at coming up with names,    

87
00:06:33,426 --> 00:06:35,526
          she suggested

  these are fantasy paintings.  

90
00:06:47,874 --> 00:06:50,808

93

105
00:07:55,174 --> 00:07:58,409
       going to turn away

106
00:07:59,546 --> 00:08:01,579
        Can you see that?       

107
00:08:01,681 --> 00:08:03,614
      I mean, he's looking

00:08:25,371 --> 00:08:30,040
    <i> It's pronounced hiraeth</i>    
      <i> with a kind of lilt.</i>     

111

     <i> And it's a Welsh word.</i>    

112
00:08:32,545 --> 00:08:34,712
      <i> I have written on it</i>     
         <i> what it means,</i>        

113
00:08:34,814 --> 00:08:38,148
    <i> which is a homesickness</i>    
           <i> for a home</i>          

114
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:40,885
            to which            
       you cannot return.       

115
00:08:40,954 --> 00:08:43,688
       A home which maybe       
           never was.           

116
00:08:44,724 --> 00:08:46,624
          The yearning,         

117
00:08:46,726 --> 00:08:50,595
            the grief           
       for the lost places      

118
00:08:50,697 --> 00:08:56,000
          of your past.         

119
00:09:01,741 --> 00:09:05,376
  <i> It's a longing for something</i> 
        <i> that never was.</i>        

120
00:09:08,014 --> 00:09:11,782
      So it's not your past     
        if it never was.        

121
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:16,687
  It's a longing for something  
  that you never had, you know? 

122
00:09:19,626 --> 00:09:21,526
      And it's really kind      
         of the essence         

123
00:09:21,628 --> 00:09:24,328
    of all of these paintings   
       in a certain sense.      

124
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:36,774
          <i> But, I mean,</i>

         What about you?        

128
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:45,049
      <i> Do I think all work</i>      
      <i> is autobiographical?</i>     

129
00:09:45,151 --> 00:09:47,217
     Is it autobiographical     
            for you?            

130
00:09:47,319 --> 00:09:49,654
   Um, yeah, certainly my work  
      is autobiographical.      

131
00:09:49,756 --> 00:09:52,222
    I mean, you know, I think   
  it has a lot to do with loss  

132
00:09:52,324 --> 00:09:56,761
         and a lot to do        
           with pain.           

133
00:09:56,863 --> 00:09:58,930
              Yes.              

134
00:09:59,032 --> 00:10:01,198
           <i> You know,</i>           
   <i> telling people's stories,</i>   
    <i> I think that's all stuff</i>   

135
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:03,233
     that was very important    
    in our house growing up.    

136
00:10:07,173 --> 00:10:08,573
            Hey.                

137
00:10:11,544 --> 00:10:13,077
          Thanks.               

138
00:10:15,582 --> 00:10:18,716
             Cooper:            
   <i> You know, in regular life,</i>  
 <i> people don't talk about death</i> 

139
00:10:18,818 --> 00:10:22,853
 and they don't talk about loss 
and they don't talk about grief.

140
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:25,823
 It makes people uncomfortable, 
    and that was the language   

141
00:10:25,925 --> 00:10:28,726
      that had been spoken      
       in my house always.      

142
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:33,764
      <i> I could always tell</i>      
    <i> as a kid that there was</i>    
      <i> this sadness to her,</i>     

143
00:10:33,866 --> 00:10:37,367
       <i> this loss that has</i>      
      <i> permeated her life.</i>      

144
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:40,071
         As a young kid,        
      I didn't really know      

145
00:10:40,172 --> 00:10:42,239
    the origins of that loss.   

146
00:10:42,341 --> 00:10:44,408
        <i> She never talked</i>       
           <i> about it.</i>           

147
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:46,877
       <i> But she's the most</i>      
       <i> sort of optimistic</i>      

148
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:49,246
      <i> and youthful person</i>      
            <i> I know.</i>            

149
00:10:49,348 --> 00:10:53,584
  So the whole idea of survival 
became really interesting to me.

150
00:10:53,686 --> 00:10:55,686
    <i> Why some people survive</i>    
       <i> and others don't.</i>       

151
00:10:55,788 --> 00:10:59,156
   I mean, how people survive   
      and kind of learning      
         how to survive.        

152
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:04,929
      I served in war zones     
    when I was, I don't know,   

153
00:11:05,031 --> 00:11:06,797
             22, 23.            

154
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:10,334
     <i> And, I mean, it sounds</i>    
       <i> ridiculous to say,</i>      

155
00:11:10,436 --> 00:11:14,138
   but it didn't seem all that  
   out of the ordinary to me.   

156
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:17,374
        Not to in any way       
       say that, you know,      

157
00:11:17,476 --> 00:11:20,210
     the background I had--     
  I mean, I had this privileged 
   background and everything.   

158
00:11:20,312 --> 00:11:23,648
-<i> ( gunshot echoes )</i>            
-<i> It wasn't that I felt</i>         
<i>comfortable in this situation.</i>  

159
00:11:23,716 --> 00:11:26,550
        They're basically       
    just blanketing this area   
   right now with sniper fire.  

160
00:11:26,653 --> 00:11:29,319
        <i> I was miserable</i>        
        <i> and I was scared</i>       
    <i> and I'm a complete wimp,</i>   

161
00:11:29,421 --> 00:11:31,789
        but I understood        
      the language of loss.     

162
00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:34,558

  or can do anything about it,  

166
00:11:43,136 --> 00:11:45,569
but I do think there's something
   about bearing witness to it  

167
00:11:45,672 --> 00:11:47,038
         and at least...        

168
00:11:49,275 --> 00:11:53,744
  you know, asking other people 
 to bear witness to it as well.

              Oh, yes.          
              With my mother.   

210
00:13:53,599 --> 00:13:55,199
                   Wow.         

211
00:13:55,301 --> 00:13:58,002
      Isn't that dress wonderful
      that she has on?

213
00:14:00,106 --> 00:14:02,006
           Cooper:              
           So that's from 1923. 

214
00:14:02,108 --> 00:14:04,074
           That's from before   
           you were born.       

215
00:14:04,177 --> 00:14:05,542
              The year before   
              I was born, yeah. 

216
00:14:05,644 --> 00:14:07,377
   So she must have been        
   pregnant with you here.      

217
00:14:07,479 --> 00:14:09,346
                     Yes.       

218
00:14:09,448 --> 00:14:12,549
             Cooper:            
  <i> Growing up, it didn't really</i> 
    <i> have any reality for me,</i>   

219
00:14:12,651 --> 00:14:14,718
      that whole Vanderbilt     
       side of the family.      

220
00:14:14,821 --> 00:14:16,987
   <i> I was much more interested</i>  
       <i> in the Cooper side</i>      
         <i> of the family,</i>        

221
00:14:17,089 --> 00:14:22,092
          <i> which seemed</i>         
   <i> much more real as opposed</i>   
    <i> to this Vanderbilt life.</i>   

222
00:14:22,195 --> 00:14:24,795
       Alfred Vanderbilt:       
      <i> The Vanderbilts came</i>     
    <i> to America in the 1600s</i>    

223
00:14:24,897 --> 00:14:28,132
  <i> and for several generations</i>  
    <i> they were unremarkable.</i>    

224
00:14:29,735 --> 00:14:32,703
      <i> And then along came</i>      
  <i> a young man named Cornelius.</i> 

225
00:14:32,805 --> 00:14:36,373
    <i> And he was an amazement,</i>   
  <i> full of energy and vitality.</i> 

226
00:14:36,475 --> 00:14:38,442
         <i> And he started</i>        
         <i> with one ship.</i>        

227
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:41,812
         And by the time        
 he was finished with shipping, 

228
00:14:41,914 --> 00:14:44,381
        he had more ships       
        than the US Navy        

229
00:14:44,483 --> 00:14:47,885
         and more money         
      than the US Treasury.     

230
00:14:47,987 --> 00:14:51,255
     <i> He was clearly by then</i>    
    <i> a transportation genius</i>    

231
00:14:51,357 --> 00:14:54,158
    <i> and he began to connect</i>    
  <i> these independent rail lines</i> 

232
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:56,493

     ( train whistle blows )    

235
00:15:03,769 --> 00:15:06,237
          Before 1913,          
      there were no taxes.      

236
00:15:06,339 --> 00:15:10,440
      <i> So enormous fortunes</i>     
     <i> like these were simply</i>

237

         <i> go on forever.</i>        

239
00:15:17,783 --> 00:15:21,585
  Well, that's my grandfather,  
    Alfred Gwynne Vanderbilt,   
         the very first.        

240
00:15:21,687 --> 00:15:23,687
        I'm Alfred Gwynne       
         Vanderbilt III.        

241
00:15:23,789 --> 00:15:27,224
         And next to him        
       is Gloria's father,      

242
00:15:27,326 --> 00:15:28,993
      Reginald Vanderbilt.      

243
00:15:29,095 --> 00:15:33,030
    Reggie was the youngest.    
 He was the baby of the family. 

244
00:15:33,132 --> 00:15:34,865
           Reggie was           
      a great deal of fun.      

245
00:15:34,967 --> 00:15:37,667
       <i> He lost legendary</i>

249

  my grandmother Gloria Morgan. 

250
00:15:50,649 --> 00:15:52,383
   <i> She was this great beauty.</i>  

251
00:15:52,484 --> 00:15:56,820
        She was, I think,       
        probably 17 or 18       
     when they got married.     

252
00:15:56,923 --> 00:15:59,623
        They didn't have        
    much of a life together,    
            frankly.            

253
00:15:59,725 --> 00:16:01,691
        I mean, they met,       
        they got married,       

254
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:05,262

258
00:16:18,044 --> 00:16:21,378
   I mean, if you think of it   
       in this time frame,      

259
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,147
           as it were,

   They had nurses and nannies

263
00:16:32,091 --> 00:16:34,558
      And my mother was 18      
        when I was born.

         <i> that there was</i>

268
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:52,176
      I mean, I didn't know

          so to speak.

00:17:19,738 --> 00:17:22,239
      I don't remember him      
             at all.            

275
00:17:22,341 --> 00:17:25,442
   You still have this fantasy  
  that your father had written  
          you a letter.         

276
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:28,912
    Well, it's still floating   
     around there somewhere.    

277
00:17:29,015 --> 00:17:31,015
        It's gonna arrive       
            someday.

279
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:34,651
       What was the idea?       

280
00:17:34,753 --> 00:17:38,822
  Well, the idea would be that  
  a letter would come from him  

281
00:17:38,924 --> 00:17:42,626
   and he would say, you know,  
      how much he loved me      

282
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:44,728
     and how beautiful I was    

283
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:48,865
         and that I was         
       gonna grow up to be      
 the most extraordinary person. 

284
00:17:48,967 --> 00:17:53,303
      And that even though      
        he wasn't there,        

285
00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:57,274
      he wanted me to know      
     that he loved me a lot.    

286
00:17:57,376 --> 00:17:59,776
    Was there ever a letter?    

287
00:17:59,878 --> 00:18:02,146
   Well, a letter did arrive.

         The dollhouse.

           It all gets          
        very complicated,       

324
00:20:11,377 --> 00:20:14,211
  though, with the paper dolls, 
    it's easier to sort out.

330
00:20:36,168 --> 00:20:38,669

   And her father was German.   
      Her mother was Irish.     

334
00:20:50,482 --> 00:20:53,016

337

338
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:05,262
    Well, I didn't think so.

     <i> She talked constantly.</i>

381
00:23:29,675 --> 00:23:33,343
 <i> And she based her personality</i> 
  <i> a lot on Napoleon, I think.</i>

00:23:35,581 --> 00:23:38,047
      <i> No, she was really,</i>      
      <i> truly extraordinary.</i>     

384
00:23:38,149 --> 00:23:40,984
            <i> I mean,</i>

        <i> She was plotting</i>

387
00:23:47,993 --> 00:23:50,360
    - She liked to...

389
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:54,831
 And then my mother fell in love
     with Prince Hohenlohe.     

390
00:23:54,933 --> 00:23:58,034
     <i> And that's what really</i>

      <i> The prince was fine,</i>     
    <i> but that he was German--</i>   

393
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:04,741
   <i> she was really hysterical</i>   
         <i> about Germans.</i>        

394
00:24:07,913 --> 00:24:11,147
   The idea that her daughter   
   was gonna marry this German  

395
00:24:11,249 --> 00:24:14,250
     and take my mother off     
       to live in Bavaria       

396
00:24:14,352 --> 00:24:17,687
         at some castle         
      made her apoplectic.      

397
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:21,925
    And my mom's grandmother    
          began to plot         

398
00:24:22,027 --> 00:24:25,028
       <i> a way to stop this</i>

399
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:28,197
          She should be         
   a Vanderbilt and should be   
      in the United States.     

400
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:30,033
   And that's her birthright.   

401
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:38,742
           Vanderbilt:          
      <i> I used to as a child</i>     
           <i> lie in bed</i>          

402

      <i> in the dark at night</i>     

403
00:24:41,112 --> 00:24:44,047
  <i> and I was afraid to go sleep</i> 
      <i> without the light on</i>     

404
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:47,183
        <i> in the bathroom</i>        
    <i> without my nurse there.</i>    

405
00:24:47,285 --> 00:24:49,619
        So she would stay       
   in the bathroom every night  

406
00:24:49,721 --> 00:24:52,889
     <i> until I went to sleep.</i>    

407
00:24:52,991 --> 00:24:54,524
      <i> Then my grandmother</i>      
         <i> would come in</i>         

408
00:24:54,626 --> 00:24:56,326
        <i> and that's when</i>

      ( voices whispering )     

411
00:25:02,133 --> 00:25:05,301
    It was like something was   
   being plotted and planned.   

412
00:25:05,403 --> 00:25:08,672
             Cooper:            
     <i> My mom's grandmother,</i>

     <i> Why do you think Dodo</i>

415
00:25:15,481 --> 00:25:18,247
           Vanderbilt:          
      <i> Because she totally</i>      
        <i> agreed with it.</i>        

416
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:21,885

    be brought up in America    

417
00:25:21,987 --> 00:25:24,087

420

    which completely changed    

421
00:25:32,063 --> 00:25:33,697
           the course

     have been happy to stay    
       in Paris with Dodo.      

423
00:25:38,336 --> 00:25:40,470
      That would have been      
     the right thing for me.

463
00:27:57,075 --> 00:28:00,777
    The last time I was here,   
           I was nine.          

464

        <i> There are rooms</i>

467
00:28:24,636 --> 00:28:27,103

00:28:27,205 --> 00:28:29,806
          Aunt Gertrude

469
00:28:29,908 --> 00:28:34,377
         And then there         
        was a sofa there        
     and another sofa here.     

470
00:28:34,479 --> 00:28:37,047
          <i> I was really</i>

00:28:37,149 --> 00:28:40,917
      <i> so they got doctors</i>

472
00:28:41,019 --> 00:28:43,019
     And I never went back.     

473
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:47,857
  When they questioned whether  
     her mother was capable     

474
00:28:47,959 --> 00:28:50,426
           of raising           
       the child properly,      

475
00:28:50,528 --> 00:28:53,663
        Gertrude decided        
      that she wanted to go     
          for custody.          

476
00:28:58,436 --> 00:29:00,336
       <i> Although Gertrude,</i>      

477
00:29:00,438 --> 00:29:03,807
     <i> I think her intentions</i>    
  <i> were the best they could be,</i> 

478
00:29:03,909 --> 00:29:08,611
    I'm not sure that warmth    
  was her main personal trait.  

479
00:29:11,683 --> 00:29:12,949
             Cooper:            
  <i> Do you think she loved you?</i>  

480
00:29:13,051 --> 00:29:14,918
        I think she did.        
              I do.             

481
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:17,520
      I think she couldn't      
      break out of herself.     

482
00:29:19,725 --> 00:29:22,358
    <i> She'd come up at night,</i>    
     <i> I'd be in bed already</i>     

483
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:25,494
   <i> and she would come and sit</i>  
  <i> on my bed to say good night.</i> 

484
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:28,331
         Once she said,         
      "I love you so much."     

485
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:30,033
    And I was so embarrassed    

486
00:29:30,135 --> 00:29:34,170
   because she had always been  
   so remote and kind of cold   

487
00:29:34,272 --> 00:29:38,241
      and it was so kind of     
      unexpected, you know?     

488
00:29:39,677 --> 00:29:41,377
        <i> Did you tell her</i>

              Yes.              

490
00:29:48,153 --> 00:29:51,020
   <i> I think she did it because</i>  
    <i> she really truly thought</i>   

491
00:29:51,123 --> 00:29:54,157
     <i> it was the best thing</i>

492
00:29:54,259 --> 00:29:57,193
   And she had been very close  
    to my father, apparently.   

493
00:29:57,295 --> 00:29:59,763
   <i> But we never spoke of it.</i>

00:30:01,733 --> 00:30:03,499
             Alfred:            
    <i> So you had both Gertrude</i>

542
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:31,867
           Vanderbilt:          
 <i> I never felt that I belonged.</i> 

543
00:34:33,938 --> 00:34:36,805
        You know, I felt        
        I was an imposter       

544
00:34:36,908 --> 00:34:39,308
   <i> and kind of a changeling.</i>   

545
00:34:42,813 --> 00:34:44,947
           Gloria was           
      that outsider person.     

546
00:34:45,050 --> 00:34:49,519
       <i> She was not quite</i>

      <i> quite a Vanderbilt.</i>      

547
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:53,022
        She really seems        
     to have raised herself.    

548
00:34:53,124 --> 00:34:56,959
     <i> But Gloria did grow up</i>    
    <i> in Gertrude's household.</i>   

549
00:34:57,062 --> 00:34:58,327
     Gertrude was an artist.    

550
00:34:58,430 --> 00:35:01,264
    She was a serious artist,   
          a sculptress.         

551
00:35:01,366 --> 00:35:03,266
     And clearly Gloria got     
          some of that.         

552
00:35:03,368 --> 00:35:06,702

       - A long time ago.       
       Way, way back.

    - Okay.                     
    - I'd love to have these    
    in the studio.

        <i> That's amazing.</i>        

556
00:35:16,381 --> 00:35:18,347
       - So you want            
       to take all these?       
       - Yes.                   

557
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:20,550
     Okay. I mean,              
     there's piles of them.     

558
00:35:20,651 --> 00:35:23,419
    - Do you want them all?     
    - I'd like them all, yes.   

559
00:35:23,521 --> 00:35:27,356
     I think we're going to need
     a truck to take them all.  

560
00:35:27,459 --> 00:35:29,925
        I mean, these are like  
        when I was in my teens. 

561
00:35:30,027 --> 00:35:32,395
       - Really?                
       - Yeah. At Wheeler.

    - Yes.                      

571
00:36:08,966 --> 00:36:12,135
 The interesting ones           
 are the ones--                 

572
00:36:12,237 --> 00:36:15,004
  interesting to me--           

573
00:36:15,106 --> 00:36:18,274
 when I was in California       

574
00:36:18,376 --> 00:36:21,577
 and had gone out               
 to stay with my mother         

575
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:23,746

We're in Hollywood.             

581
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:49,004
And I want                      
to thank everybody

582

- And you're                    
still in high school.           
- I had another year at Wheeler.

592
00:37:33,585 --> 00:37:35,451
    I hadn't finished           
    high school.

595
00:37:39,056 --> 00:37:41,023
  it was like living            
  in a hotel.                   

596
00:37:41,125 --> 00:37:43,959
      - Mm-hmm.                 
      - I could do anything     
      I wanted to do.           

597
00:37:44,061 --> 00:37:48,297
     And, I mean, looking       
     back at it now,            

598
00:37:48,399 --> 00:37:50,299
      it was very terrible.     

599
00:37:50,401 --> 00:37:53,001
     You know?                  
     I mean, I would not        
     want my daughter           

600
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:55,238
     to behave the way          
     I did, you know?           

601
00:37:56,841 --> 00:38:01,210
    But there was               
    kind of nobody around       

602
00:38:01,312 --> 00:38:04,046
      to counsel me.            

603
00:38:04,148 --> 00:38:05,581
            So Aunt Gertrude--  

604
00:38:05,683 --> 00:38:08,551
    So anyway, I wrote          
    to Aunt Gertrude to ask--   

605
00:38:08,653 --> 00:38:12,722
  to say, you know,             
  that I was going to stay on.  

606
00:38:12,823 --> 00:38:17,159
     I'm trying to find         
     the letter where she--     

607
00:38:17,262 --> 00:38:19,328

608
00:38:21,366 --> 00:38:23,966
      Oh, there's one

00:39:00,772 --> 00:39:02,971
   so it was kind of            
   too late, you know?          

620
00:39:03,073 --> 00:39:05,408
      So she never actually said
      this kind of stuff to you?

621
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:08,210
    No, no.                     
    This was the first time.    

622
00:39:08,313 --> 00:39:09,745
        I mean...               

623
00:39:14,819 --> 00:39:18,086
      My plan was to finish     
           at Wheeler           

624
00:39:18,189 --> 00:39:20,356
           and instead          
      of going to college,      

625
00:39:20,458 --> 00:39:22,591
   to go to the Arts Students   
       League in New York.      

626
00:39:22,694 --> 00:39:24,293
           That's what          
         I wanted to do.        

627
00:39:24,395 --> 00:39:27,630
   And live at Aunt Gertrude's  
       in Washington Mews.      

628
00:39:27,732 --> 00:39:29,231
         And that's what        
        I expected to do        

629
00:39:29,334 --> 00:39:33,101
         when I went out

630
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:35,571

       Most of the things       
       in the dream boxes       
    I found in flea markets.    

726
00:45:23,754 --> 00:45:28,423
 <i> I did a dream box which I have</i>

      this extraordinary...

00:45:35,232 --> 00:45:38,667
        they were written       
            in 1934.

00:45:38,769 --> 00:45:41,136
        <i> They're all from</i>

733
00:45:48,879 --> 00:45:52,715
       because part of me       
    really wants to read them   

734
00:45:52,817 --> 00:45:54,917
        and then another        
          part of me--          

735
00:45:55,019 --> 00:45:56,885

739
00:46:07,631 --> 00:46:09,531
       I mean, I made them      
        into a dream box.       

740
00:46:09,633 --> 00:46:13,335
  I didn't have to do anything  
    except get the Plexiglas    
         to put over it.        

741
00:46:18,976 --> 00:46:21,043
        Maybe they're not       
      love letters at all,      

742
00:46:21,145 --> 00:46:24,246
          but I somehow         
         think they are.

744
00:46:29,186 --> 00:46:30,986
            Of course           
            it's gonna happen.  

745

                    Absolutely. 
                    Absolutely. 

747
00:46:38,495 --> 00:46:40,362

       over the age of 16       

750
00:46:46,804 --> 00:46:49,371

755
00:47:05,489 --> 00:47:09,391
        He obviously was        
    sort of smitten with me.    

756
00:47:09,493 --> 00:47:11,193
   And I couldn't believe it.   

757
00:47:11,295 --> 00:47:12,995
             I mean,            
       I was so flattered.      

758
00:47:13,097 --> 00:47:15,597

when you first met him?         

759
00:47:16,901 --> 00:47:19,034
    Well, it's a terrible       
    photograph of him,          

760
00:47:19,136 --> 00:47:22,237

   met him and married him.

763
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:32,380
       Knew him for a week      
       and married three        
       weeks later.

         - You were 20?

          - Yeah. Yeah.

    Getting your mommy back.

     that my mom did of her.    

822
00:50:46,076 --> 00:50:48,010
      She was a big person.     

823
00:50:48,112 --> 00:50:49,844
            You know,           
     a big sort of presence.

829
00:51:05,362 --> 00:51:07,129
            He wasn't           
       the kind of person       

830
00:51:07,231 --> 00:51:09,364
      that you'd bond with,     
      you know what I mean?     

831
00:51:16,173 --> 00:51:18,106
             Cooper:            
     <i> I think my mom always</i>     
       <i> dreamed of having</i>       

832
00:51:18,208 --> 00:51:22,610
     <i> sort of a little house</i>    
       <i> and a white picket</i>      
         <i> fence family.</i>         

833
00:51:22,712 --> 00:51:27,282
    And that kind of vision,    
     that's what she wanted     
         her life to be.        

834
00:51:27,384 --> 00:51:29,717
        <i> But in reality,</i>        
       <i> she has this drive</i>      

835
00:51:29,819 --> 00:51:32,387
 <i> and she has this determination</i>
   <i> to propel herself forward.</i>  

836
00:51:32,489 --> 00:51:36,491
         And that drive         
   makes it impossible to have  
     that white picket fence    

837
00:51:36,593 --> 00:51:37,859
           and to have          
        that family life        

838
00:51:37,961 --> 00:51:41,896
     and to have, you know,     
        a calm existence.

     <i> my mark, so to speak.</i>     

840
00:51:46,136 --> 00:51:51,039
 And the most mark one can make 
       is to be an actress      

841
00:51:51,141 --> 00:51:55,143

842
00:51:55,245 --> 00:51:58,012

844
00:52:00,750 --> 00:52:04,886
         <i> And I also had</i>        
   <i> a very subjective feeling</i>   

845
00:52:04,988 --> 00:52:08,723
        that in each part       
          I would find          

846
00:52:08,825 --> 00:52:11,293
         part of myself,        

847
00:52:11,395 --> 00:52:15,063

           Stokowski:           
   <i> One of the reasons I think</i>  

850
00:52:22,706 --> 00:52:25,373
        that they perhaps       
        had disagreement        

851
00:52:25,476 --> 00:52:29,444
       was because he was       
    a little bit discouraging   
      of her doing acting.      

852
00:52:29,546 --> 00:52:33,115
   <i> I think perhaps he didn't</i>   
   <i> consider it as high an art</i>

862
00:53:05,282 --> 00:53:07,749

      from the public eye.      

863
00:53:07,851 --> 00:53:11,186
       Well, I didn't want      
           to do that.          

864
00:53:11,288 --> 00:53:13,622

  a wonderful mother, you know? 

867
00:53:20,264 --> 00:53:22,964
        I mean, it would        
      reflect well on her.      

868
00:53:23,066 --> 00:53:24,799
          Why was that

869
00:53:24,901 --> 00:53:26,801

873

           Because of Stokowski.

874

    Because then was the time   
 for me to start supporting her 

875
00:53:40,350 --> 00:53:43,084

876
00:53:43,187 --> 00:53:46,321

        that's what I did       

877
00:53:46,423 --> 00:53:48,723

we were little kids,

01:07:07,857 --> 01:07:11,225
     And then how'd you meet    
           my father?           

1122
01:07:11,327 --> 01:07:14,996
          Well, Sidney          
      and I went for dinner     
      at Luanne McGrath's.      

1123
01:07:15,098 --> 01:07:18,799
     <i> Wyatt Cooper was there</i>    
      <i> and he was an actor.</i>     

1124
01:07:18,901 --> 01:07:19,933
    Hey, Mark.                  

1125
01:07:20,036 --> 01:07:21,768
      - Wyatt!                  
      - Good luck tonight.      

1126
01:07:21,871 --> 01:07:25,772
           Vanderbilt:          
  <i> He had become a screenwriter</i> 
        <i> when I met him.</i>        

1127
01:07:25,875 --> 01:07:28,275
     Luanne said afterwards     
         that, you know,        

1128
01:07:28,378 --> 01:07:32,046
        he was impressed        
            with me.            

1129
01:07:33,883 --> 01:07:36,250
       And I was impressed      
       with him, you know?      

1130
01:07:36,352 --> 01:07:38,585
     <i> Otherwise you wouldn't</i>    
            <i> be here.</i>           

1131
01:07:38,687 --> 01:07:40,521
         ( both laugh )         

1132
01:07:40,623 --> 01:07:43,557
     <i> So what-- but you were</i>    
    <i> still married to Sidney</i>    
          <i> at the time.</i>         

1133
01:07:43,659 --> 01:07:44,658
              Yes.              

1134
01:07:44,760 --> 01:07:47,328
        My mom and Sidney       
            separated           

1135
01:07:47,430 --> 01:07:50,131
          and divorced          
      when I was about 12.      

1136
01:07:50,233 --> 01:07:54,935
       That was difficult       
       for me, of course,       

1137
01:07:55,038 --> 01:07:57,238
     but on the other hand,     

1138
01:07:57,340 --> 01:07:59,573
      I could see how happy     
           my mom was.          

1139
01:08:02,078 --> 01:08:05,279
           Vanderbilt:          
       <i> I had an awful lot</i>      
     <i> to work out in my life</i>    

1140
01:08:05,381 --> 01:08:09,016
 <i> and it took me years and years</i>
   <i> and years to work it out.</i>   

1141
01:08:12,855 --> 01:08:16,490
   <i> But when I married Wyatt,</i>   
    <i> I knew it was for life.</i>    

1142
01:08:17,793 --> 01:08:19,193
             Cooper:            
       <i> My dad wanted you</i>       

1143
01:08:19,295 --> 01:08:20,928
     <i> to reestablish contact</i>    
         <i> with your mom?</i>        

1144
01:08:21,030 --> 01:08:24,031
           Yes, he was          
      a great help in that.     

1145
01:08:36,912 --> 01:08:40,614
  She then had something called 
      hysterical blindness      

1146
01:08:40,716 --> 01:08:43,451
     which you're not blind,    
          but you're--          

1147
01:08:43,553 --> 01:08:47,221
         psychologically        
        something happens       
     so that you can't see.     

1148
01:08:49,024 --> 01:08:51,225
    <i> I felt why was I afraid</i>    

1149
01:08:51,327 --> 01:08:55,496
      <i> of this sad person,</i>      
           <i> you know?</i>           

1150
01:08:55,598 --> 01:08:57,565
       Who was so gentle.       

1151
01:08:57,666 --> 01:09:01,435
      I mean, she was like      
     a butterfly, you know?     

1152
01:09:04,140 --> 01:09:06,640
           Stokowski:           
      <i> When Mom's mother--</i>      

1153
01:09:06,742 --> 01:09:11,112
  <i> for the first time I met her</i> 
      <i> when I was 13 or 14,</i>     

1154
01:09:11,214 --> 01:09:14,415
      <i> and just she visited</i>     
    <i> and I thought to myself,</i>   

1155
01:09:14,517 --> 01:09:16,049
       "Wow, this is            
      my grandmother            

1156
01:09:16,185 --> 01:09:17,918
 and this is the first time     
 I'm meeting her."              

1157
01:09:18,020 --> 01:09:20,053
        So when she reconnected 
        with her mother,        

1158
01:09:20,156 --> 01:09:22,523
  that's when you met her mother
  for the first time?           

1159
01:09:22,625 --> 01:09:24,592
       - Yeah.                  
       - Do you remember        
       what she was like?       

1160
01:09:24,693 --> 01:09:27,228
 She was very sort of           
 formally dressed               

1161
01:09:27,330 --> 01:09:31,465
 and very prim                  
 and slightly reserved.         

1162
01:09:33,736 --> 01:09:36,203
         <i> We didn't have</i>        
       <i> much conversation,</i>      

1163
01:09:36,305 --> 01:09:40,474
 but I knew that it was         
 an important event.            

1164
01:09:40,576 --> 01:09:43,910
           Vanderbilt:          
 <i> We went into my studio and...</i> 

1165
01:09:45,814 --> 01:09:50,284
      we really didn't talk     
         about anything         

1166
01:09:50,386 --> 01:09:53,354
        except chitchat,        
            you know?           

1167
01:09:55,057 --> 01:09:57,824
        Which, of course,       
          I regret now.         

1168
01:10:01,297 --> 01:10:05,666
     <i> She died the day after</i>    
        <i> Carter was born.</i>       

1169
01:10:05,768 --> 01:10:07,834
   <i> And the last time I spoke</i>   
      <i> to her on the phone</i>      

1170
01:10:07,936 --> 01:10:10,371
      was just a few hours      
       after he was born.       

1171
01:10:10,473 --> 01:10:12,706
         And, of course,        
         I wanted a girl        

1172
01:10:12,808 --> 01:10:15,509
    <i> and I was gonna tell her</i>   
  <i> I was gonna call her Gloria.</i> 

1173
01:10:15,611 --> 01:10:18,646
          <i> I almost was</i>         
      <i> going to lie to her</i>      
   <i> and tell her it was a girl</i>  

1174
01:10:18,747 --> 01:10:21,348
  <i> because I knew that she was</i>  
     <i> so ill, but I didn't.</i>     

1175
01:10:21,450 --> 01:10:25,018
      And when I told her,      
            she said,           

1176
01:10:25,120 --> 01:10:27,821
    "Oh, Gloria, you're gonna   
     start a baseball team."    

1177
01:10:27,923 --> 01:10:30,357
           ( laughs )           

1178
01:10:30,459 --> 01:10:32,893
           Those were           
      her last words to me.     

1179
01:11:09,332 --> 01:11:11,665
           Vanderbilt:          
  <i> One night before I was going</i> 
     <i> to escape, I thought,</i>     

1180
01:11:11,767 --> 01:11:15,636
      <i> "I'm going to count</i>      
    <i> all the terrible regrets</i>   
     <i> of my life, you know,</i>     

1181
01:11:15,738 --> 01:11:18,239
      <i> 'cause now I'm able</i>      
         <i> to face them."</i>        

1182
01:11:18,341 --> 01:11:21,742
      So I started to count     
      my regrets, you know?     

1183
01:11:23,178 --> 01:11:25,412
        <i> It was not easy.</i>       

1184
01:11:27,015 --> 01:11:28,982
             Cooper:            
         <i> You don't want</i>        
        <i> to go into them?</i>       

1185
01:11:29,084 --> 01:11:33,053
    Well, my greatest regret    
   is that I wasn't with Dodo   
         when she died.         

1186
01:11:38,427 --> 01:11:40,427
    <i> When I left Stokowski...</i>   

1187
01:11:42,498 --> 01:11:45,899
     <i> there were things that</i>    
    <i> were happening so fast,</i>    
           <i> you know?</i>           

1188
01:11:46,001 --> 01:11:50,937
         <i> And I kind of</i>         
        <i> lost her again.</i>        

1189
01:11:52,308 --> 01:11:54,808
         <i> But she never</i>         
        <i> stopped writing.</i>       

1190
01:11:57,780 --> 01:12:00,847
            <i> And then</i>           
     <i> the last letter I got,</i>    

1191
01:12:00,949 --> 01:12:03,317
     which was typewritten,     

1192
01:12:03,419 --> 01:12:05,952
         was to say that        
     she had died, you know?    

1193
01:12:12,762 --> 01:12:14,495
             Cooper:            
       <i> Where did she die?</i>      

1194
01:12:14,597 --> 01:12:15,929
      <i> Or do you know when?</i>     

1195
01:12:16,031 --> 01:12:18,098
           Vanderbilt:          
    <i> With Catholic Charities.</i>   

1196
01:12:20,569 --> 01:12:22,536
        And I regret that       
           very much.           

1197
01:12:22,638 --> 01:12:24,871
             And...             

1198
01:12:24,973 --> 01:12:27,107
        <i> she was with me</i>

        <i> and I would like</i>

1200

  <i> Nothing is the way we think</i>

     <i> It really isn't ever.</i>     

1202
01:12:58,674 --> 01:13:00,674
             Cooper:            
      <i> You know, one thing</i>      
         <i> she said to me</i>        

1203
01:13:00,776 --> 01:13:04,645
       is that she's never      
    had a plan for her life,    
   which I just find amazing.   

1204
01:13:04,747 --> 01:13:08,014
        It's kind of like       
       walking a tightrope      

1205
01:13:08,116 --> 01:13:09,916
          all the time.         

1206
01:13:10,018 --> 01:13:12,653
    And then you have to stay   
        on the tightrope        

1207
01:13:12,755 --> 01:13:16,490
     so you don't fall off,     
            you know?           

1208
01:13:18,994 --> 01:13:21,595
             Cooper:            
     <i> And so my dad brought</i>

      was going to be like      

1211
01:13:27,102 --> 01:13:28,836

01:13:33,041 --> 01:13:34,775
    It's interesting because    
    they could not have been    

1214
01:13:34,877 --> 01:13:36,810
   from more different worlds,

1280
01:16:55,911 --> 01:16:58,745
     because he didn't know     
      if he would be around     

1281
01:16:58,847 --> 01:17:02,849

1282
01:17:02,952 --> 01:17:06,887

1291
01:17:35,084 --> 01:17:37,784
 And it was the first indication
I got that there was something--

1292
01:17:37,886 --> 01:17:39,285
  some sort of physical thing.  

1293

         <i> Heart disease</i>

1295
01:17:44,493 --> 01:17:47,460
         <i> But it wasn't</i>         
         <i> until I was 10</i>        

1296
01:17:47,562 --> 01:17:49,195
    <i> and it was right before</i>    
          <i> Christmas--</i>          

1297
01:17:49,297 --> 01:17:51,431
         so it had been         
        December of '77--       

1298
01:17:51,533 --> 01:17:53,133
    he went to the hospital.    

1299
01:17:53,235 --> 01:17:56,503
         And at the time        
         they had a rule        

1300
01:17:56,605 --> 01:17:58,839
    that kids weren't allowed   
     to go to ICU to visit.     

1301
01:17:58,941 --> 01:18:01,108
         <i> At some point</i>         
    <i> we were kind of snuck in</i>   

1302

    <i> because I think somebody</i>

      <i> weren't going well.</i>      

1303
01:18:04,980 --> 01:18:07,147
 And I remember just seeing him 
      once in the hospital.     

1304
01:18:07,249 --> 01:18:08,782
           And I hated          
      seeing him like that.     

1305
01:18:08,884 --> 01:18:11,518
   I hated sort of seeing him   
      in a weakened state.      

1306
01:18:11,620 --> 01:18:14,688
       He said to me that       
     he'd like to be buried     

1307
01:18:14,790 --> 01:18:16,857
              in...             

1308
01:18:20,663 --> 01:18:22,863
            you know,           
         where my family        
           was buried           

1309
01:18:22,965 --> 01:18:25,365
  because it was near New York  
         and you could--        

1310
01:18:25,467 --> 01:18:28,334
   we could go and visit him,   
           the grave.           

1311
01:18:30,039 --> 01:18:32,472
           And I said,          
     "You're not gonna die."    

1312
01:18:32,574 --> 01:18:34,607
      I mean, I was just--      

1313
01:18:34,710 --> 01:18:36,977
           it was just          
       an inconceivable--       

1314
01:18:39,447 --> 01:18:42,082
    you know, I mean, I said,   
     "You're not gonna die."    

1315
01:18:42,184 --> 01:18:43,817
          And he said,          
           "I'm not?"           

1316
01:18:43,886 --> 01:18:47,487
     As if I knew something     
      that he didn't know.      

1317
01:18:47,589 --> 01:18:50,123
           And I said,          
   "No, you're not gonna die."  

1318
01:18:50,225 --> 01:18:55,062

1319
01:18:56,298 --> 01:18:57,664
        it was five days

1320
01:18:57,766 --> 01:18:59,465
    January 5, that he died.

   <i> We are gathered here today</i>

   <i> and the magnificent world</i>   
        <i> on the outside.</i>        

1331
01:19:41,143 --> 01:19:44,577

1333
01:20:06,902 --> 01:20:11,104
           Vanderbilt:          
     <i> I tell you, we used to</i>    
 <i> really go crazy for Christmas.</i>

1334
01:20:14,609 --> 01:20:17,510
      <i> And then Wyatt died</i>      
         <i> on January 5,</i>         

1335
01:20:17,612 --> 01:20:21,915
        and from then on        
       we never had a tree      
          or anything.          

1336
01:20:22,017 --> 01:20:24,550
       And so we've never       
  sort of done anything since.  

1337
01:20:26,789 --> 01:20:30,791
   I mean, I was 10 years old,  
     so I don't think it had    
       much reality to me.      

1338
01:20:30,893 --> 01:20:33,493
        <i> I just felt like</i>       

1339
01:20:33,595 --> 01:20:38,064
 over a relatively short course 
     of time, I had changed.    

1340
01:20:38,167 --> 01:20:39,800
       I think I just got       
         a lot quieter.         

1341
01:20:39,902 --> 01:20:43,136
         Or just less--         
       I think the person       
        I was before that       

1342
01:20:43,238 --> 01:20:45,105
   was a lot more interesting,  
       a lot more outgoing      

1343
01:20:45,174 --> 01:20:47,808
     <i> and funny and sort of</i>     
  <i> a more compelling character</i>  

1344
01:20:47,910 --> 01:20:50,643
         <i> than I am now</i>         
       <i> or that I became.</i>       

1345
01:20:56,118 --> 01:20:58,451
   <i> I didn't want there to be</i>   
  <i> more surprises down the road</i> 

1346
01:20:58,553 --> 01:21:02,789
    <i> and I wanted to be able</i>    
   <i> to take care of the people</i>  
         <i> in my circle.</i>         

1347
01:21:02,891 --> 01:21:04,590
       I wanted to be able      
     to take care of my mom,    

1348
01:21:04,693 --> 01:21:07,027
       I wanted to be able      
    to take care of my nurse    
         and my brother.        

1349
01:21:07,129 --> 01:21:08,895
       And so I started--       

1350
01:21:08,997 --> 01:21:12,199
         I-- the only--         
        I mean, I was 11        
      or something by then.     

1351
01:21:12,301 --> 01:21:16,169
       I think I got a job      
        as a child model.       

1352
01:21:17,706 --> 01:21:20,106
      <i> And then I remember</i>      
     <i> soon after my dad died</i>

  <i> a Jacques Cousteau special--</i> 

1354

   <i> that if sharks stop moving</i>  
     <i> forward that they die</i>     

1355
01:21:27,382 --> 01:21:29,449

01:21:29,551 --> 01:21:32,219
      <i> through their gills</i>      
    <i> by their forward motion.</i>   

1357
01:21:32,321 --> 01:21:35,488
     <i> That notion has always</i>    
   <i> really resonated with me--</i>  

1358
01:21:37,192 --> 01:21:39,726
      <i> the need to continue</i>

1359
01:21:39,828 --> 01:21:42,528
        <i> and to continue</i>        
          <i> to breathe.</i>          

1360
01:21:43,899 --> 01:21:47,067
           Vanderbilt:

1362
01:21:52,307 --> 01:21:55,808
         it's only once         

1363
01:21:55,911 --> 01:21:58,578
         that you accept        
     that life is a tragedy     

1364
01:21:58,680 --> 01:22:00,680
       that you can start       
            to live.            

1365
01:22:00,782 --> 01:22:02,382
       I do believe that.       

1366
01:22:06,088 --> 01:22:09,689
             Cooper:

     <i> being a single mother?</i>    

1367
01:22:12,094 --> 01:22:15,728
  I didn't really think of ever 
     getting married again.     

1368
01:22:19,467 --> 01:22:23,503
    I thought I could kind of   
   do it on my own, you know?   

1369
01:22:25,073 --> 01:22:28,608
         <i> And very soon</i>

      the whole jeans thing     
            started,            

1371
01:22:30,678 --> 01:22:34,147
        so I was sort of        
          thrown into--         

1372
01:22:34,249 --> 01:22:38,484
      I was really occupied     
          all the time.         

1373

1374
01:22:40,522 --> 01:22:42,488
            Yeah, they don't cut
            or pinch anywhere.  

1375
01:22:42,590 --> 01:22:44,057
        What makes them         
        this comfortable?       

1376
01:22:44,159 --> 01:22:46,226
         They're my new

1377
01:22:46,328 --> 01:22:48,228

         a pleasure to wear.

         We would count

         we saw her name        

1380

1383

      ended up-- there was      
     a restaurant in Biloxi,    

1416
01:24:42,877 --> 01:24:44,677
         Mary Mahoney's,        
     that had gotten flooded    

1417
01:24:44,779 --> 01:24:46,646
        and I went there        
     to do a story about it.    

1418
01:24:46,748 --> 01:24:50,417
         And, you know,         
      Bob Mahoney came out,     
           the owner,           

1419
01:24:50,519 --> 01:24:53,053
          and he said,          
         "Hey, Anderson,        
         welcome back."         

1420
01:24:53,155 --> 01:24:54,620
           And I said,          
       "What do you mean,       
         welcome back?"         

1421
01:24:54,722 --> 01:24:55,888
     He said, "You were here    
         with your dad."        

1422
01:24:55,990 --> 01:24:57,890
          You just came         
          from the water park   

1423
01:24:57,992 --> 01:25:00,093
         and you had            
         your bathing suit on   
         and a towel around you.

1424
01:25:00,195 --> 01:25:02,395
     - I remember that.         
     - And your daddy was       
     sitting right in here.     

1425
01:25:02,497 --> 01:25:05,365
 -<i> So this is</i>                   
 <i> the room we ate in?</i>           
 -<i> This is the room you ate in.</i> 

1426
01:25:05,467 --> 01:25:07,333
             Cooper:            
       <i> For me, it united</i>       
   <i> the past and the present.</i>   

1427
01:25:07,436 --> 01:25:10,370
       <i> It united my past</i>       
          <i> with my dad</i>          

1428
01:25:10,472 --> 01:25:13,373
     and it was the present     
          of what I do          

1429
01:25:13,475 --> 01:25:16,742
         and also it was        
         all about loss.        

1430
01:25:16,844 --> 01:25:18,978
   <i> Everything was about loss.</i>  

1431
01:25:19,081 --> 01:25:22,515
   We like to think, you know,  
    we've moved beyond things   

1432
01:25:22,617 --> 01:25:26,686
     or gotten over things,     
           but I think          

1433
01:25:26,788 --> 01:25:28,754
      it's all still there.     

1434
01:25:30,692 --> 01:25:33,025
      <i> I've always thought</i>      
         <i> I wanted kids,</i>        

1435
01:25:33,128 --> 01:25:37,830
       <i> but I also realize</i>      
        <i> my limitations.</i>        

1436
01:25:37,932 --> 01:25:40,266
       I need sort of time      
           in my head,          

1437
01:25:40,368 --> 01:25:43,836
        and I don't know        
     that you can have that     
      when you're a parent.     

1438
01:25:43,938 --> 01:25:47,474
   So-- and I would also have   
  to change my career totally.  

1439
01:25:47,576 --> 01:25:50,810
       <i> I would want to be</i>      
  <i> the kind of dad my dad was,</i>  

1440
01:25:50,912 --> 01:25:54,914
        <i> so I definitely</i>        
        <i> don't feel like</i>        

1441
01:25:55,016 --> 01:25:56,516
       <i> as much as I used</i>       
          <i> to feel like</i>         

1442
01:25:56,618 --> 01:25:59,652
    <i> I really, really, really</i>   
       <i> want to have kids.</i>      

1443
01:25:59,754 --> 01:26:03,289
      <i> I think a part of it</i>     
     <i> is realizing how much</i>     
       <i> like my mom I am.</i>       

1444
01:26:03,391 --> 01:26:05,958
          And if you're         
          never content         

1445
01:26:06,060 --> 01:26:09,762
 and you have that restlessness 
    and you have that drive,    

1446
01:26:09,864 --> 01:26:11,564
      that's a tough thing      
            sometimes           

1447
01:26:11,666 --> 01:26:14,300
    to incorporate with kids    
          and a family.         

1448
01:26:20,142 --> 01:26:22,242
     <i> I just always remember</i>    
         <i> my mom having</i>         

1449
01:26:22,344 --> 01:26:26,712
       <i> this kind of look</i>       
        <i> behind her eyes.</i>       

1450
01:26:26,814 --> 01:26:29,982
       <i> It was almost like</i>      
   <i> a kind of a faraway look.</i>   

1451
01:26:32,320 --> 01:26:34,287
        ( voice breaks )        
        I mean, it's one        
         of the really--        

1452
01:26:39,060 --> 01:26:40,627
          I don't know,         
   there's something about it.  

1453
01:26:40,728 --> 01:26:42,328
             It's--             

1454
01:26:49,404 --> 01:26:52,505
             I mean,            
          it's very sad         
          to me that--          

1455
01:26:55,843 --> 01:27:00,012
   you know, all these things   
     that she sort of wanted    

1456
01:27:00,114 --> 01:27:03,149
            are so--            
    in some ways, so simple.    

1457
01:27:13,395 --> 01:27:15,662
        <i> What do you want</i>       
      <i> to say about Carter?</i>     

1458
01:27:15,763 --> 01:27:17,597
          - About who?          
          -<i> Carter.</i>             

1459
01:27:17,699 --> 01:27:19,465
          Oh, darling.          

1460
01:27:21,236 --> 01:27:23,002
        ( clears throat )       

1461
01:27:31,846 --> 01:27:34,480
        Well, he's always       
       with me, you know?       

1462
01:27:34,583 --> 01:27:36,082
            And I...            

1463
01:27:40,255 --> 01:27:42,222
            You know,           
         when he died...        

1464
01:27:44,992 --> 01:27:50,830
    I went to bed for about,    
          I don't know,         

1465
01:27:50,932 --> 01:27:52,765
          three weeks.          

1466
01:27:52,867 --> 01:27:55,335
     And all I did was cry.     

1467
01:27:57,038 --> 01:27:59,672
   And I haven't cried since.   

1468
01:27:59,774 --> 01:28:02,208
        It's like there's       
        not a tear left.        

1469
01:28:05,647 --> 01:28:08,514
   Designer Gloria Vanderbilt   
 is under a doctor's care today 

1470
01:28:08,617 --> 01:28:12,685
 following the apparent suicide 
      last night of her son     
         Carter Cooper.         

1471
01:28:12,787 --> 01:28:15,455
       Cooper jumped from       
     the 14th-floor terrace     

1472
01:28:15,557 --> 01:28:17,223
   of her Manhattan penthouse.  

1473
01:28:17,325 --> 01:28:19,692
        Gloria Vanderbilt       
     witnessed the suicide.     

1474
01:28:19,794 --> 01:28:23,363
   Police say he left no note.  
      He was 23 years old.      

1475
01:28:23,465 --> 01:28:26,932
    I mean, you know, my mom    
    has told me the story...    

1476
01:28:29,003 --> 01:28:30,737
      I don't know how many     
       hundreds of times.       

1477
01:28:30,838 --> 01:28:32,772
      I've heard of exactly     
          what happened         

1478
01:28:32,874 --> 01:28:36,876
      in those final hours      
    and minutes and seconds,    

1479
01:28:36,978 --> 01:28:39,779
      but it still doesn't      
        make sense to me.       

1480
01:28:49,023 --> 01:28:51,691
            <i> I always</i>           
     <i> thought we were close,</i>    
     <i> and then I realized--</i>     

1481
01:28:51,793 --> 01:28:55,961
     <i> I mean, the fact that</i>     
     <i> he would kill himself</i>     
          <i> in that way</i>          

1482
01:28:56,063 --> 01:28:58,665
        <i> and I would have</i>       
    <i> no indication whatsoever</i>   

1483
01:28:58,767 --> 01:29:02,168
   tells me that in some ways   
     we weren't that close.     

1484
01:29:02,270 --> 01:29:03,803
          And I always          
        sort of imagined        

1485
01:29:03,905 --> 01:29:06,339
  that we would become friends  
           as adults.           

1486
01:29:06,441 --> 01:29:09,342
 We'd get through our childhoods
      and meet up later on      

1487
01:29:09,444 --> 01:29:12,378
  and then kind of reflect back 
           on things.           

1488
01:29:12,480 --> 01:29:15,515
        But, you know...        

1489
01:29:17,285 --> 01:29:20,687
   <i> I think my father's death</i>   
     <i> was harder on Carter.</i>     

1490
01:29:20,789 --> 01:29:22,689
    <i> And I completely didn't</i>    
   <i> realize that at the time.</i>   

1491
01:29:22,791 --> 01:29:24,624
     <i> He was two years older</i>    
          <i> than I was,</i>          

1492
01:29:24,726 --> 01:29:27,794
     <i> so he had an even more</i>    
      <i> mature relationship</i>      
          <i> with my dad.</i>         

1493
01:29:27,895 --> 01:29:30,062
        I do realize now        

1494
01:29:30,164 --> 01:29:33,132
        sort of how hard        
  that would have been on him.  

1495
01:29:34,769 --> 01:29:37,870
          Pearson Marx:         
    <i> Carter was made for joy,</i>   

1496
01:29:37,972 --> 01:29:43,008
           but he knew          
     from losing his father     

1497
01:29:43,110 --> 01:29:45,511
      that terrible things      
             happen             

1498
01:29:45,613 --> 01:29:49,114
   and you can't prevent them   
         from happening.        

1499
01:29:50,752 --> 01:29:52,552
      <i> We met at Princeton.</i>     

1500
01:29:52,654 --> 01:29:55,388
    <i> You know, I had a crush</i>    
       <i> on him from afar.</i>       

1501
01:29:55,490 --> 01:29:59,158
      <i> But the spring term</i>      
       <i> of my senior year,</i>      

1502
01:29:59,260 --> 01:30:01,227
      <i> we started spending</i>      
         <i> time together.</i>        

1503
01:30:08,636 --> 01:30:11,971
   <i> Then the last few months,</i>   

1504
01:30:12,073 --> 01:30:14,607
         I just remember        
          Carter's mood         

1505
01:30:14,709 --> 01:30:17,810
         getting darker.        

1506
01:30:17,912 --> 01:30:22,648
   And I think it was because   
        he had bad asthma       

1507
01:30:22,751 --> 01:30:26,753
          <i> and he hated</i>         
        <i> the medication.</i>        

1508
01:30:26,855 --> 01:30:30,089
       <i> It made him speedy</i>      

1509
01:30:30,191 --> 01:30:32,792
      <i> and sort of jagged.</i>      

1510
01:30:32,894 --> 01:30:36,228
       He eventually moved      
          to Washington         

1511
01:30:36,330 --> 01:30:39,098
       and that's sort of       
       when we kind of had      

1512
01:30:39,200 --> 01:30:42,435
            a natural           
       breaking off point.      

1513
01:30:43,805 --> 01:30:45,905
          <i> It was just</i>          
      <i> kind of a beautiful,</i>     

1514
01:30:46,007 --> 01:30:49,041
     <i> bittersweet good-bye.</i>     

1515
01:30:49,143 --> 01:30:51,176
          I don't know.         
     I don't know why I will    
         always remember        

1516
01:30:51,279 --> 01:30:55,448
      that he was wearing--     
     it was a slightly silly

        <i> That was my last</i>

1522
01:31:14,536 --> 01:31:17,102
         <i> And afterward</i>         
       <i> we went back home</i>       

1523
01:31:17,204 --> 01:31:19,305
  <i> and for the first time ever</i>  

1524
01:31:19,407 --> 01:31:21,541
       <i> he seemed to be in</i>      
 <i> some sort of disturbed state.</i> 

1525
01:31:21,643 --> 01:31:24,343
      <i> And he was sleeping</i>      
       <i> at my mom's house.</i>      

1526
01:31:24,446 --> 01:31:26,879
         He clearly had         
         some sort of--         

1527
01:31:26,981 --> 01:31:28,915
      was having some sort      
         of emotional...        

1528
01:31:30,518 --> 01:31:32,552
        I don't know even       
   how to describe it, really.  

1529
01:31:32,654 --> 01:31:34,320
           It was like          
         he was scared.         

1530
01:31:34,422 --> 01:31:36,456
             <i> My mom</i>

1531
01:31:36,558 --> 01:31:39,258
     <i> and he started seeing</i>     
 <i> a therapist right after that.</i> 

1532
01:31:39,360 --> 01:31:41,393
   <i> I happened to run into him</i>  
         <i> on the street</i>         

1533
01:31:41,496 --> 01:31:43,996
         <i> in early July,</i>        
 <i> I think it was July 4 weekend.</i>

1534
01:31:44,098 --> 01:31:46,866
         He said to me,         
    "The last time I saw you,   
     I was like an animal."     

1535
01:31:46,968 --> 01:31:50,402
    And I didn't even really    
        know what to say.       

1536
01:31:52,674 --> 01:31:55,575
    And A, I was so surprised   
  to sort of just run into him  

1537
01:31:55,677 --> 01:31:58,243
            and I was           
        so kind of happy        

1538
01:31:58,346 --> 01:32:01,814
    that he could make light    
   about the way he had been.   

1539
01:32:01,916 --> 01:32:04,584
   To me it just seemed like,   
     okay, well, he's making    
         light about it,        

1540
01:32:04,686 --> 01:32:06,586
      so it can't have been     
          that serious.         

1541
01:32:06,688 --> 01:32:09,822
    So I didn't even really--   
           I think I--          

1542
01:32:09,924 --> 01:32:11,757
        I don't even know       
    what I said in response.    

1543
01:32:11,860 --> 01:32:13,659
    And we ended up stopping    
          and having--          

1544
01:32:13,761 --> 01:32:16,295
        we went for lunch       
            together.           

1545
01:32:16,397 --> 01:32:19,732
   And that was the last time   
           I saw him.

  at the Democratic nomination. 

1549
01:32:29,611 --> 01:32:31,577
    And I was with my sister    

1550
01:32:31,679 --> 01:32:33,746
       and he was talking

1556
01:32:45,593 --> 01:32:48,995
       and I called Carter      
      to just tell him this     
   funny line of my sister's.   

1557
01:32:49,096 --> 01:32:50,997
             <i> And...</i>

1561
01:33:02,243 --> 01:33:05,344
     He asked me if I would     
      come over that night.     

1562
01:33:05,446 --> 01:33:08,247

     to think about it now,     

1563
01:33:08,349 --> 01:33:10,850

1564
01:33:10,952 --> 01:33:13,819
       Like quite a large,

1565
01:33:13,922 --> 01:33:16,088
           And I just           
    thought, "You know what?    
       I don't want to go.      

1566
01:33:16,190 --> 01:33:18,925

   I'm still in love with him   

1567
01:33:19,027 --> 01:33:21,561

1568
01:33:21,663 --> 01:33:23,996

   we get together tomorrow?"

1572
01:33:37,612 --> 01:33:41,013

     and I think he woke up     

1573
01:33:41,115 --> 01:33:45,317
       and I think he was       
      totally disoriented.

01:33:45,419 --> 01:33:47,286

        What's going on?"       

1576
01:33:50,357 --> 01:33:52,224
          He was dazed.         

1577
01:33:52,326 --> 01:33:54,994
        And then he ran.        

1578
01:33:55,096 --> 01:33:58,097
      And I ran after him.

      What it is, Carter?"      

1579
01:33:58,199 --> 01:34:01,233
  <i> And he ran through the hall</i>

1584
01:34:13,681 --> 01:34:16,682
         he was sitting         
          on the ledge          

1585
01:34:16,784 --> 01:34:20,720

      <i> He was looking down,</i>

1587
01:34:24,859 --> 01:34:27,392
          I was really          
     very close behind him.     

1588
01:34:27,495 --> 01:34:29,095
           I mean, I--          

1589
01:34:29,196 --> 01:34:31,764
      and I said, "Carter,      
      what are you doing?"      

1590
01:34:31,866 --> 01:34:34,900
     And he put his hand up     
     because I started to go    
          towards him.          

1591
01:34:35,003 --> 01:34:37,036
     And he put his hand up     
           to stop me.          

1592
01:34:37,138 --> 01:34:40,806
         And I thought,         

1593
01:34:40,908 --> 01:34:43,575
        you know, if I--        
       what I wanted to do      

1594
01:34:43,678 --> 01:34:46,612
  was take him and grab one arm 
        and grab him off,       

1595
01:34:46,714 --> 01:34:50,149
    <i> but I thought that might</i>   
    <i> send him over, you know?</i>   

1596
01:34:50,251 --> 01:34:54,086
   And then I started getting   
        down on my knees.       

1597
01:34:54,188 --> 01:34:57,389
        I said, "I beg--"

    Get up, get up, get up."    

1598
01:34:57,491 --> 01:34:59,625
          So I got up.          

1599

            ( sighs )

01:35:21,182 --> 01:35:23,683
          hanging down.
