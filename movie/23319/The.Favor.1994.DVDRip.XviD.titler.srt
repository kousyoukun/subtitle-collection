2
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:42,549
Mommy?
Do dead people swallow?

3
00:02:51,196 --> 00:02:52,287
Well?

4
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:00,795
Do they?

5
00:03:08,079 --> 00:03:09,104
No.

6
00:03:09,615 --> 00:03:12,242
Then what do they do
with the water in their mouth?

7
00:03:12,817 --> 00:03:15,514
They stop getting water
in their mouths.

8
00:03:16,388 --> 00:03:17,445
Why?

9
00:03:19,791 --> 00:03:21,655
Don't wake Daddy.

10
00:03:21,926 --> 00:03:23,417
Daddy's awake.

11
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:27,162
It's Saturday, honey.
Go back to sleep.

12
00:03:27,232 --> 00:03:30,292
Daddy, they don't let you
be a pilot if you wear glasses!

13
00:03:30,369 --> 00:03:31,357
Hannah!

14
00:03:31,435 --> 00:03:33,199
Ollie, off!

15
00:03:33,772 --> 00:03:36,639
Come on.
Off the bed, Ollie. Off!

16
00:03:37,965 --> 00:03:41,901
I've been playing handball
with quadratic equations all night.

17
00:03:42,402 --> 00:03:43,892
Yeah?
Who won?

18
00:03:44,471 --> 00:03:46,736
I better get this
article finished...

19
00:03:46,807 --> 00:03:49,832
...or I am never going to
get a good night's sleep.

20
00:03:50,645 --> 00:03:52,440
I'm working at school today.

21
00:03:52,511 --> 00:03:54,570
No, you've got the kids till 2:00.

22
00:03:54,647 --> 00:03:58,242
I've my museum class, then I drop
off the payroll at Al's doughnut hole.

23
00:03:58,317 --> 00:04:00,251
I want cinnamon...
No, sugar!

24
00:04:00,386 --> 00:04:03,513
- White ones!
- No doughnuts for you little porkers.

25
00:04:03,755 --> 00:04:05,189
Oink!
Oink!

26
00:04:05,457 --> 00:04:08,687
Honey, make my cruller
with white icing.

27
00:04:10,995 --> 00:04:12,461
Two minutes.

28
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,191
It's not fair!

29
00:04:18,235 --> 00:04:19,293
Is this fair?

30
00:04:19,469 --> 00:04:20,868
- Yes!
- Yes!

31
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:24,665
- What do you want for breakfast?
- I'm dead.

32
00:04:25,676 --> 00:04:27,336
That's easy.

33
00:04:28,244 --> 00:04:33,238
Look carefully at the way Rubens
uses pinks and whites in his women.

34
00:04:33,649 --> 00:04:36,708
They have the alabaster
cast of a statue...

35
00:04:36,785 --> 00:04:39,253
...with just enough
rosy shades...

36
00:04:39,321 --> 00:04:41,983
...to make them eminently
approachable.

37
00:04:42,457 --> 00:04:44,617
All I know is,
they make me feel thin.

38
00:04:44,792 --> 00:04:47,693
And of course,
the famous red hair.

39
00:04:48,362 --> 00:04:53,355
Most art historians believe this
was the color of his mistress' hair.

40
00:04:55,736 --> 00:04:58,727
Emily, are we listing lovers
or acquaintances?

41
00:04:59,473 --> 00:05:00,838
You're done?

42
00:05:01,108 --> 00:05:03,701
I've been married for 10 years.
What do you want from me?

43
00:05:03,776 --> 00:05:06,608
- Didn't you go to college?
- Yeah, but...

44
00:05:12,784 --> 00:05:15,480
"One-night stand,
handsome, great in bed. "

45
00:05:15,654 --> 00:05:16,915
And you regretted it?

46
00:05:17,456 --> 00:05:20,754
Him. He asked me
to bring a friend next time.

47
00:05:21,624 --> 00:05:23,149
And you can't
remember his name?

48
00:05:23,227 --> 00:05:27,527
Listen, when you've had over...
the names get a little fuzzy.

49
00:05:28,365 --> 00:05:29,593
God!

50
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:33,526
"Jean-Claude. "
Is this the guy in Saint Martin?

51
00:05:34,504 --> 00:05:36,801
Yeah. You spent the weekend
in the Caribbean...

52
00:05:36,872 --> 00:05:39,238
...and didn't I go to Marineland?

53
00:05:40,143 --> 00:05:44,078
You came home with a plastic shark.
I came home with crabs.

54
00:05:50,085 --> 00:05:52,678
Now, if you ladies will follow me.

55
00:05:54,255 --> 00:05:58,487
This French sculpture
is from the 20th century...

56
00:05:58,826 --> 00:06:01,988
...and by Edmond Louise Colette.

57
00:06:02,396 --> 00:06:06,957
This sculpture epitomizes
the art movement...

58
00:06:07,299 --> 00:06:10,064
...from Art Nouveau to Art Deco.

59
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:11,792
Who was the best, and why?

60
00:06:12,471 --> 00:06:15,962
- There's an emphasis on simple lines...
- Howard.

61
00:06:16,509 --> 00:06:19,000
Because he just adored sex
and couldn't get enough?

62
00:06:19,278 --> 00:06:21,245
Because we were in love.

63
00:06:21,813 --> 00:06:24,475
- I've done that.
- Listen to you.

64
00:06:25,016 --> 00:06:27,416
It must be hell being
in a great marriage.

65
00:06:28,086 --> 00:06:31,987
It is when you've been invited
to your 15th high school reunion...

66
00:06:32,222 --> 00:06:36,818
...and it kicks off wild sexual fantasies
about your first love.

67
00:06:38,861 --> 00:06:41,762
- Old numero uno, Robert?
- No!

68
00:06:41,831 --> 00:06:45,324
Tommy and I never did it.
We did everything but for two years.

69
00:06:45,402 --> 00:06:46,459
What?

70
00:06:46,835 --> 00:06:50,464
You're from the coast.
In Ohio, you don't do it. I was saving it.

71
00:06:50,539 --> 00:06:54,101
- For who? Robert Hornswath?
- Evidently.

72
00:06:54,177 --> 00:06:55,269
So, are you going?

73
00:06:56,110 --> 00:07:00,104
I don't know.
I haven't seen him in 15 years.

74
00:07:00,314 --> 00:07:04,512
He lives in Denver now.
He probably wouldn't even be there.

75
00:07:07,188 --> 00:07:09,418
Can you recover from a face-lift
in five months?

76
00:07:09,523 --> 00:07:12,424
Are you going to worry about this
or have fun with it?

77
00:07:13,426 --> 00:07:14,620
You'll have fun.

78
00:07:14,694 --> 00:07:17,857
I know I'm never going to
hear the end of it now.

79
00:07:18,898 --> 00:07:21,492
Emily, what is the
matter with me?

80
00:07:22,301 --> 00:07:25,532
Every day, I fantasize about
jumping on a plane to Denver...

81
00:07:25,671 --> 00:07:28,697
...finding Tommy,
and screwing him silly!

82
00:07:34,213 --> 00:07:35,543
Pardon me.

83
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:40,875
So what do you think of this?

84
00:07:41,251 --> 00:07:43,982
God, that's disgusting, Mom.

85
00:07:44,822 --> 00:07:45,981
Peter?

86
00:07:53,597 --> 00:07:56,030
What do you think of this one?

87
00:07:56,733 --> 00:07:58,165
That's more Emily.

88
00:07:58,801 --> 00:08:01,895
You know, bookkeepers can be chic.
Peter?

89
00:08:04,473 --> 00:08:06,804
Yeah, she's not wearing a bra.

90
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:10,905
- Can I see that, please?
- No.

91
00:08:11,779 --> 00:08:14,179
Bedtime.
That's it.

92
00:08:14,249 --> 00:08:17,183
- Tomorrow's my birthday!
- I know it's your birthday.

93
00:08:17,251 --> 00:08:19,618
Your Daddy and I have
a lot of getting ready to do.

94
00:08:19,686 --> 00:08:23,382
- I don't want to go to bed.
- You never want to go to bed.

95
00:08:23,523 --> 00:08:24,615
Good night, Daddy!

96
00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:26,681
Good night, sweetie.
I'll be up in a minute.

97
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:29,194
- Brush your teeth.
- Okay.

98
00:08:38,437 --> 00:08:40,097
You dropped those.

99
00:08:48,213 --> 00:08:49,509
I know that tune.

100
00:09:48,634 --> 00:09:50,225
Can we do it without kissing?

101
00:09:50,435 --> 00:09:53,961
Sure. Yeah.
Come here.

102
00:09:55,607 --> 00:09:59,337
Can we do it without moving?
I'm exhausted.

103
00:10:00,377 --> 00:10:03,278
Good. Me, too.
I thought you wanted to.

104
00:10:04,414 --> 00:10:05,938
Not me.
How about you?

105
00:10:09,051 --> 00:10:11,315
- We can do it tomorrow.
- Yeah.

106
00:10:13,089 --> 00:10:14,181
Nope.

107
00:10:15,224 --> 00:10:17,453
After Gina's party,
I doubt it.

108
00:10:17,826 --> 00:10:19,020
Monday.

109
00:10:19,728 --> 00:10:22,026
Department meeting.
Goes late.

110
00:10:22,097 --> 00:10:23,429
Tuesday.

111
00:10:24,499 --> 00:10:26,693
Yeah, let's shoot for Tuesday.

112
00:10:43,317 --> 00:10:44,805
That was nice.

113
00:10:45,752 --> 00:10:47,276
It's always nice.

114
00:11:29,724 --> 00:11:31,215
Lipstick. Yeah.

115
00:11:51,244 --> 00:11:53,006
Where are you going?

116
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:56,245
To do my taxes
and learn Spanish.

117
00:11:56,816 --> 00:12:00,252
- I need to sleep, Elliott.
- You can sleep here, you know.

118
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:02,749
No, I can't.
You're always drawing me.

119
00:12:03,121 --> 00:12:05,180
You waste a lot
of time sleeping.

120
00:12:06,358 --> 00:12:09,293
I like sleeping.
It makes the years go by faster.

121
00:12:09,394 --> 00:12:12,727
That's a lousy attitude
for a woman barely past 30...

122
00:12:12,863 --> 00:12:14,353
...everything ahead of her.

123
00:12:14,898 --> 00:12:18,595
35 more years of finding
the perfect piece of culture...

124
00:12:18,702 --> 00:12:23,161
...for over Mrs. Konzulman's sectional,
unmarred by love or family.

125
00:12:24,374 --> 00:12:26,309
Leave me if you must...

126
00:12:26,443 --> 00:12:29,740
...but if you're checking out
that Denver gallery on Friday...

127
00:12:29,811 --> 00:12:32,212
...I'd like to see you
tomorrow sometime.

128
00:12:32,881 --> 00:12:34,576
Can't tomorrow.

129
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:36,912
Tomorrow's my goddaughter's
birthday party.

130
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:39,352
I like birthday parties.

131
00:12:40,322 --> 00:12:43,051
No.
You're not invited.

132
00:12:43,924 --> 00:12:46,120
Are you saying
you're ashamed of me?

133
00:12:47,861 --> 00:12:51,093
Everyone there is bringing their children.
I'll be dating one.

134
00:12:52,532 --> 00:12:53,625
Yes.

135
00:12:54,902 --> 00:12:56,095
I'm 26.

136
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:59,900
I don't know why you're pressing this.
You'll just get bored.

137
00:12:59,973 --> 00:13:02,066
With Pin the Tail on the Donkey?
No way.

138
00:13:02,475 --> 00:13:05,875
- All right. Come.
- I will. Thank you.

139
00:13:07,147 --> 00:13:08,977
Elliott!

140
00:13:12,785 --> 00:13:15,309
I can't believe you
used my lipstick.

141
00:13:20,426 --> 00:13:22,949
This is going to cost me $100.

142
00:13:23,293 --> 00:13:25,057
$100 for a lipstick?

143
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:29,833
- No, a trip to the cosmetic counter.
- Right.

144
00:13:39,242 --> 00:13:41,038
Is everybody having fun?

145
00:13:42,944 --> 00:13:44,276
He's cute.

146
00:13:44,647 --> 00:13:47,479
- Where's my hat?
- Right there!

147
00:13:47,549 --> 00:13:50,382
- Have you seen my hat?
- Right there!

148
00:13:54,689 --> 00:13:58,488
I'm going to get
another apple juice.

149
00:14:02,095 --> 00:14:04,495
He's got a special
birthday hat for you!

150
00:14:04,698 --> 00:14:06,165
There you go!

151
00:14:07,166 --> 00:14:09,532
And he's got something for you!

152
00:14:12,205 --> 00:14:14,002
Hannah, when is your birthday?

153
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,930
Three more months.

154
00:14:16,709 --> 00:14:19,302
Three months?
I can't wait that long.

155
00:14:20,146 --> 00:14:21,272
Me, too.

156
00:14:21,514 --> 00:14:25,244
I cannot wait to give you your
present for three months.

157
00:14:29,421 --> 00:14:33,550
You can write anything you want in there:
your secrets, your dreams...

158
00:14:34,191 --> 00:14:36,216
...and only you can read them.

159
00:14:38,863 --> 00:14:40,387
It's wonderful!

160
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:44,188
Mom!

161
00:14:44,334 --> 00:14:47,633
Mr. Lucky's got one for you!
There you go!

162
00:14:52,608 --> 00:14:54,974
And Mr. Lucky's
got one for you!

163
00:14:57,312 --> 00:14:58,835
There you go!

164
00:15:01,849 --> 00:15:03,544
Who else wants one?

165
00:15:11,892 --> 00:15:14,760
- How's it going, Chef?
- Crazy.

166
00:15:16,428 --> 00:15:18,828
Interesting bunch over there.

167
00:15:19,699 --> 00:15:22,724
Yeah. That's part of
a parenting group.

168
00:15:23,335 --> 00:15:26,133
Personally,
I'd rather belong to a satanic cult.

169
00:15:26,237 --> 00:15:28,729
Probably be easier
on the kids, yes.

170
00:15:29,608 --> 00:15:34,010
- Boy, they really like these suckers raw.
- So how old is...

171
00:15:38,283 --> 00:15:39,307
Hi.

172
00:15:40,184 --> 00:15:41,582
How are you?

173
00:15:52,461 --> 00:15:53,450
Great party.

174
00:15:53,529 --> 00:15:54,553
Thanks, Elliott.

175
00:15:55,832 --> 00:15:59,232
I particularly liked the part
where Mr. Lucky couldn't find his hat.

176
00:15:59,402 --> 00:16:01,335
I never get tired of that.

177
00:16:01,536 --> 00:16:03,367
Can you make purple?

178
00:16:03,638 --> 00:16:05,266
- Purple?
- Milk.

179
00:16:06,908 --> 00:16:10,036
Do you want magenta purple
or fuchsia purple?

180
00:16:11,111 --> 00:16:13,136
Emily said you were good.

181
00:16:13,748 --> 00:16:16,079
What else does our friend say?

182
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:19,944
That you're a great dancer.

183
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:22,749
I'll settle for that.

184
00:16:23,757 --> 00:16:25,986
- So how old is...
- Pin the Tail on the Donkey.

185
00:16:26,059 --> 00:16:28,755
I forgot to put up the donkey.
Can you believe it?

186
00:16:28,828 --> 00:16:31,660
Peter!
Didn't I just see him?

187
00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:34,256
You know what?
We really have to be going.

188
00:16:34,334 --> 00:16:37,325
- But aren't you going to
stay for cake? - Cake?

189
00:16:37,502 --> 00:16:39,163
I'm sorry.
Jeez!

190
00:16:39,237 --> 00:16:41,262
- Thank you.
- You're going?

191
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:43,274
You don't want any cake?

192
00:16:45,509 --> 00:16:46,840
Thank you.

193
00:16:48,546 --> 00:16:51,174
- Purple! - If you're going
to have a hot fling...

194
00:16:51,248 --> 00:16:54,740
...you might as well have it
with someone who looks like that.

195
00:16:55,019 --> 00:16:56,508
Donkey.

196
00:17:01,423 --> 00:17:04,689
You wanted to meet my friends.
I guess they don't hold your attention.

197
00:17:04,761 --> 00:17:08,161
They seem like very nice people.
We don't exactly have a lot in common.

198
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:10,891
- So what?
- No. You don't.

199
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:13,566
You make that sound
like an accusation.

200
00:17:13,636 --> 00:17:16,433
You wanted to come,
but you just wanted to come and go.

201
00:17:16,504 --> 00:17:19,439
I'm not leaving. This is my
goddaughter's birthday party.

202
00:17:19,507 --> 00:17:22,601
I'll stay till the last gift is open
and the last kid goes home.

203
00:17:22,677 --> 00:17:25,111
All right.
You want me to stay, I'll stay.

204
00:17:25,278 --> 00:17:28,270
I never wanted you to
come in the first place.

205
00:17:29,449 --> 00:17:30,710
All right.

206
00:17:31,251 --> 00:17:33,913
I get the picture.
You'll get home all right?

207
00:17:34,054 --> 00:17:35,885
- Kathy will take me.
- Okay.

208
00:17:43,629 --> 00:17:47,462
Remember we said we would stop
this when it wasn't fun anymore?

209
00:17:48,633 --> 00:17:50,067
Are we having fun now?

210
00:17:52,537 --> 00:17:53,663
No.

211
00:18:10,687 --> 00:18:12,279
Careful, Liana.

212
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:18,784
I know.

213
00:18:19,529 --> 00:18:20,687
Elliott leave?

214
00:18:20,761 --> 00:18:23,731
Why can't I be attracted to a nice,
solid professional?

215
00:18:23,799 --> 00:18:27,701
- You got any divorced MBAs around?
- I liked him. I thought he was disarming.

216
00:18:27,769 --> 00:18:31,295
- We broke up.
- In a phony sort of way.

217
00:18:32,173 --> 00:18:34,368
And look what he calls purple.

218
00:18:35,543 --> 00:18:37,534
You can do better than that.

219
00:18:37,745 --> 00:18:41,202
- Anyway, his bod wasn't that great.
- Yes, it was.

220
00:18:42,415 --> 00:18:43,882
Yes, it was.

221
00:18:56,694 --> 00:18:59,163
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

222
00:19:00,098 --> 00:19:01,190
Great party, Mom.

223
00:19:02,133 --> 00:19:03,795
Come to dinner Friday.

224
00:19:03,869 --> 00:19:06,233
I can't. I'm supposed to
be in Denver on Friday.

225
00:19:06,837 --> 00:19:08,032
Denver?

226
00:19:08,172 --> 00:19:10,867
Elliott's got a show there
in a couple months.

227
00:19:11,074 --> 00:19:12,372
Tommy's Denver?

228
00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:17,646
- Emily, you gotta look him up for me.
- And say what?

229
00:19:17,714 --> 00:19:21,275
He's got a sporting goods store
right downtown: Andrews Sporting.

230
00:19:21,685 --> 00:19:23,845
Pretend you're buying a gun.

231
00:19:24,919 --> 00:19:28,481
You haven't seen him since you were 16.
He's probably fat, bald, and ugly.

232
00:19:28,657 --> 00:19:31,352
Great! What better way to
put me out of my suffering?

233
00:19:31,426 --> 00:19:33,917
Think about it.
Why spoil a great fantasy?

234
00:19:34,929 --> 00:19:37,489
It's beginning to make my
marriage look like sludge.

235
00:19:37,632 --> 00:19:39,997
- You have a wonderful marriage.
- Exactly.

236
00:19:40,467 --> 00:19:44,063
Come on, do me a favor.
Just look at him.

237
00:19:45,873 --> 00:19:46,897
Maybe.

238
00:19:51,210 --> 00:19:54,475
The last thing are
these two there.

239
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:56,307
Jamison Thomas Gallery?

240
00:20:01,486 --> 00:20:03,421
Which one goes on the left?

241
00:20:14,664 --> 00:20:16,428
It's not enough
just to look him up.

242
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:19,229
This one. Definitely.
What are you talking about?

243
00:20:19,335 --> 00:20:21,896
I have to know what it's like.
You must sleep with him.

244
00:20:27,577 --> 00:20:30,671
I've got a plane to catch in 30 minutes.
Are these the invoices?

245
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:34,306
Listen to me.
Someone's got to complete the mission.

246
00:20:34,383 --> 00:20:37,978
I can't sleep with Tommy, but you can.
It's the only way.

247
00:20:38,188 --> 00:20:40,485
Don't say another word.
I'm your gal.

248
00:20:40,788 --> 00:20:43,417
- You're not taking me seriously.
- Yes, I am.

249
00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:46,551
Go there and not sleep with
your ex-boyfriend? That's stupid.

250
00:20:46,627 --> 00:20:49,494
You don't seem to understand.
This is really getting to me.

251
00:20:51,933 --> 00:20:54,366
I'm just asking you
a simple favor.

252
00:20:57,905 --> 00:20:59,768
I'll try to look him up, okay?

253
00:21:00,941 --> 00:21:01,669
Thank you!

254
00:21:03,176 --> 00:21:05,940
And Saturday, come straight
to my house from the airport.

255
00:21:08,713 --> 00:21:11,182
And when you meet him,
don't wear this.

256
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:12,512
I hate this on you.

257
00:21:18,956 --> 00:21:20,447
Three plus three is six.

258
00:21:20,825 --> 00:21:22,588
One plus one is two.

259
00:21:22,994 --> 00:21:27,020
- 10 plus 10 is 20.
- Wait, Mom. Give us a few more minutes!

260
00:21:27,231 --> 00:21:30,132
It's 8:00 Saturday night.
You know the rule.

261
00:21:35,204 --> 00:21:38,332
Okay, bed.
Come on, Hannah.

262
00:21:40,476 --> 00:21:42,740
There you go.
Did you brush your teeth?

263
00:21:42,812 --> 00:21:45,541
All right.
Thank you.

264
00:21:46,883 --> 00:21:48,679
How about you?
Brush your teeth?

265
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:50,513
- Yeah.
- Good girl.

266
00:21:50,785 --> 00:21:52,150
Good night, sweetheart.

267
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:55,154
- Good night, Mommy.
- Good night, Mommy.

268
00:21:55,389 --> 00:21:56,755
Come on, Ollie.

269
00:21:57,826 --> 00:21:58,814
Good night, Ollie.

270
00:21:59,959 --> 00:22:01,587
Did I mention that I love you?

271
00:22:01,729 --> 00:22:04,128
- I love you, too, Mom.
- I love you.

272
00:22:04,264 --> 00:22:05,630
Good night.

273
00:22:15,041 --> 00:22:17,134
The attractor splits in two.

274
00:22:20,312 --> 00:22:22,405
Magnetic fields drift.

275
00:22:27,018 --> 00:22:28,952
Impulse becomes erratic.

276
00:22:31,923 --> 00:22:34,323
<i>She walked in the room</i>

277
00:22:36,126 --> 00:22:38,151
<i>So she could rub his neck</i>

278
00:22:44,934 --> 00:22:47,233
<i>Then she gave
him a little kiss</i>

279
00:22:50,172 --> 00:22:51,936
<i>Something like this</i>

280
00:22:55,844 --> 00:22:58,209
<i>Then on Monday,
she calls him on the phone</i>

281
00:22:58,279 --> 00:23:00,248
<i>Says she'll bring
the kids home"</i>

282
00:23:00,816 --> 00:23:04,182
From ballet lessons so that I can
stay at school and correct papers?

283
00:23:05,019 --> 00:23:06,384
Fat chance.

284
00:23:10,424 --> 00:23:14,190
- I'm so glad I'm married to you.
- What brought that on?

285
00:23:14,962 --> 00:23:18,090
Your music.
It's beautiful.

286
00:23:19,699 --> 00:23:21,564
- Really?
- Yeah.

287
00:23:22,068 --> 00:23:25,003
- You lie like a rug.
- I don't lie!

288
00:23:26,907 --> 00:23:29,499
- I'll get it.
- No. That's Emily.

289
00:23:33,912 --> 00:23:34,936
So?

290
00:23:35,714 --> 00:23:37,305
It was a good trip.

291
00:23:37,715 --> 00:23:39,842
Did you see anybody I know?

292
00:23:46,757 --> 00:23:47,984
Hey, Em.

293
00:23:53,096 --> 00:23:55,894
- Spill it.
- You sure you want to hear this?

294
00:23:55,999 --> 00:23:57,590
He's a fat slob.

295
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:01,069
Emily, what is the point
if you don't tell me?

296
00:24:01,137 --> 00:24:04,401
Is he married with five kids?
Is he a bum? Is he dead?

297
00:24:04,506 --> 00:24:06,940
What? See?
Look, I'm just making myself crazy.

298
00:24:07,009 --> 00:24:08,874
- You sure?
- Tell me!

299
00:24:10,879 --> 00:24:12,641
You did me the favor.

300
00:24:13,714 --> 00:24:17,081
- What are you talking about?
- I'm talking about Tom.

301
00:24:18,085 --> 00:24:22,487
The big, strong hunk
in the red flannel shirt...

302
00:24:23,323 --> 00:24:26,918
...with a tongue like velvet
and the arms you could die in.

303
00:24:29,361 --> 00:24:30,453
You met him?

304
00:24:31,364 --> 00:24:34,093
No wonder you always
fantasize about him.

305
00:24:34,767 --> 00:24:37,327
This one's a man!

306
00:24:38,336 --> 00:24:42,329
Capital M-A-N, man.

307
00:24:53,951 --> 00:24:58,944
If there were a nuclear war,
Tom's the one I'd want in my bomb shelter.

308
00:24:59,623 --> 00:25:01,113
He sure grew up.

309
00:25:01,458 --> 00:25:05,917
Actually, if there wasn't a nuclear war,
I'd want him in my bomb shelter.

310
00:25:06,128 --> 00:25:08,323
You don't have a bomb shelter.

311
00:25:08,864 --> 00:25:10,764
And get up off the floor.

312
00:25:11,834 --> 00:25:14,358
Kathy, this man made
me feel like a woman.

313
00:25:14,536 --> 00:25:17,869
- What do you mean?
- We talked. We laughed. We danced.

314
00:25:18,206 --> 00:25:21,834
- So the two of you...
- All night.

315
00:25:38,825 --> 00:25:41,315
Honey, we're trying
to talk in here!

316
00:25:42,227 --> 00:25:43,319
Okay.

317
00:25:56,740 --> 00:25:58,264
Tell me everything.

318
00:25:58,542 --> 00:26:03,070
I could still see him as
the plane took off.

319
00:26:07,650 --> 00:26:09,618
I could still smell him.

320
00:26:12,689 --> 00:26:14,383
That's everything.

321
00:26:17,526 --> 00:26:21,485
And to think I almost
didn't even call him.

322
00:26:23,197 --> 00:26:24,528
Kathy!

323
00:26:25,167 --> 00:26:28,465
The man knew what I
wanted before I did.

324
00:26:30,372 --> 00:26:31,360
You seem upset.

325
00:26:32,939 --> 00:26:34,737
No, not at all.

326
00:26:35,143 --> 00:26:39,375
No. Couldn't have worked out better.
See? It's finished.

327
00:26:40,448 --> 00:26:43,780
He's out of my mind,
and I have you to thank for it.

328
00:26:44,050 --> 00:26:47,041
I never have to think
of him again, ever!

329
00:26:48,722 --> 00:26:50,348
You're mad at me.

330
00:26:51,256 --> 00:26:53,248
Kathy, I did you a favor.

331
00:26:53,359 --> 00:26:55,350
It was your idea for
me to sleep with him.

332
00:26:55,894 --> 00:26:58,294
Once!
Not eight times.

333
00:26:58,830 --> 00:27:00,729
The shower doesn't count.
We didn't...

334
00:27:01,533 --> 00:27:04,195
Can't you do it on a bed
like normal people?

335
00:27:04,269 --> 00:27:06,260
I never told you to do it
on a butcher block!

336
00:27:08,906 --> 00:27:13,138
This may come as a surprise to you,
but I did it for me.

337
00:27:14,144 --> 00:27:15,134
Wait!

338
00:27:16,812 --> 00:27:18,609
Did you talk about me at all?

339
00:27:18,881 --> 00:27:23,682
You've got Peter and the kids.
Let me have my one lousy night in Denver.

340
00:27:25,054 --> 00:27:27,078
Did he ask for my number?

341
00:27:27,522 --> 00:27:29,855
Yeah, he asked for your number.

342
00:27:38,466 --> 00:27:39,592
Good night, Peter.

343
00:27:40,935 --> 00:27:42,664
Leaving already, Em?

344
00:27:43,571 --> 00:27:45,538
- Want something to eat?
- Nah.

345
00:27:45,838 --> 00:27:47,534
- Sure?
- Yeah.

346
00:27:47,875 --> 00:27:49,069
You're missing out.

347
00:27:50,044 --> 00:27:51,134
See you later.

348
00:27:51,377 --> 00:27:52,776
All right.

349
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:56,915
I guess it's you and me, buddy.

350
00:28:13,097 --> 00:28:15,657
What was that all
about with Emily?

351
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:17,527
Nothing.

352
00:28:18,703 --> 00:28:21,227
A teacher from
Princeton started today.

353
00:28:22,005 --> 00:28:23,200
Joe Dubin.

354
00:28:23,507 --> 00:28:26,804
He's a brilliant guy.
They just throw grants at him.

355
00:28:27,142 --> 00:28:29,270
He sticks with basic
linear questions like:

356
00:28:29,346 --> 00:28:32,315
"How big is it?" and
"How long does it last?"

357
00:28:32,382 --> 00:28:34,213
So he gets a lot of equipment.

358
00:28:35,583 --> 00:28:37,677
He gets a lot of attention.

359
00:28:37,853 --> 00:28:41,914
But I don't know, I think he totally
ignores the disorderly behavior...

360
00:28:41,991 --> 00:28:45,857
...of a lot of important phenomena.

361
00:28:47,462 --> 00:28:50,454
Can't deal with it.
Doesn't know what to make of it, right?

362
00:28:52,033 --> 00:28:53,363
My stuff, you know...

363
00:28:53,433 --> 00:28:58,166
...this equation that I'm testing
about reversing magnetic fields...

364
00:28:58,238 --> 00:29:01,502
With that stuff,
I gotta deal with disorderly behavior.

365
00:29:02,208 --> 00:29:05,644
Because patterns
can be stable...

366
00:29:05,711 --> 00:29:09,909
...but when they're really fascinating
is when they're...

367
00:29:10,715 --> 00:29:12,080
...unstable.

368
00:29:12,484 --> 00:29:13,816
Chaotic.

369
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:16,248
Wild and abandoned.

370
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:20,013
Olives.

371
00:29:20,991 --> 00:29:22,425
So you look at the patterns.

372
00:29:22,494 --> 00:29:25,257
Logic gets you so far,
then you gotta go on a feeling.

373
00:29:25,329 --> 00:29:28,492
You've got to follow your intuition.

374
00:29:28,565 --> 00:29:32,194
I've got a feeling
that there is a point of crisis...

375
00:29:32,503 --> 00:29:35,403
...in stable systems
of magnetic fields...

376
00:29:36,706 --> 00:29:40,870
...where small changes get magnified,
and then all of a sudden...

377
00:29:41,044 --> 00:29:42,978
...everything goes amok.

378
00:29:45,347 --> 00:29:47,781
I don't know.
It's just a feeling.

379
00:29:51,086 --> 00:29:55,146
That's why I say fractal geometry
is a lot like the blues.

380
00:29:55,289 --> 00:29:58,725
The passion, the power, the mystery...
I don't know.

381
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:02,158
Sometimes you have to look
at things in the periphery...

382
00:30:02,263 --> 00:30:07,256
...because if you look right at it,
you don't see what's there.

383
00:30:16,742 --> 00:30:17,937
I'm sorry.

384
00:30:19,945 --> 00:30:21,571
Are you hungry?

385
00:30:22,481 --> 00:30:24,914
I'm going to make
you one of these.

386
00:30:33,157 --> 00:30:35,284
- Honey.
- What?

387
00:30:35,793 --> 00:30:37,885
Give somebody else a chance.

388
00:30:44,968 --> 00:30:47,595
- Beautiful sermon.
- Thank you.

389
00:30:47,903 --> 00:30:49,996
Beautiful sermon.

390
00:30:54,810 --> 00:30:57,107
Hannah, here!

391
00:31:18,565 --> 00:31:20,395
It's always a tragedy...

392
00:31:21,768 --> 00:31:25,134
...to see a young man cut down
in the bloom of his life.

393
00:31:26,873 --> 00:31:29,841
He was a good father
and a wonderful husband...

394
00:31:30,276 --> 00:31:32,243
...although sometimes inattentive.

395
00:31:33,278 --> 00:31:35,872
He always performed satisfactorily...

396
00:31:36,615 --> 00:31:39,606
...but not with the enthusiasm
of the early years.

397
00:31:40,718 --> 00:31:44,745
Nonetheless, it was a cruel,
shocking blow to those he left behind.

398
00:31:47,124 --> 00:31:50,388
We ask God to comfort
and restore Kathy...

399
00:31:51,327 --> 00:31:53,522
...easing her through
the next few months...

400
00:31:54,230 --> 00:31:57,893
...which I know will be a trying
and lonely time for her.

401
00:32:28,427 --> 00:32:29,588
Mommy?

402
00:32:30,397 --> 00:32:32,159
Mommy?

403
00:32:35,367 --> 00:32:38,199
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

404
00:32:38,537 --> 00:32:39,697
Careful.

405
00:32:44,809 --> 00:32:46,606
We're okay.

406
00:32:46,678 --> 00:32:49,010
I'm having a hard
time with this.

407
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:52,113
- You forgot me!
- Thank you!

408
00:32:52,550 --> 00:32:53,743
Ready?

409
00:32:54,218 --> 00:32:55,845
Boy, that sermon...

410
00:32:56,788 --> 00:32:59,311
- You seemed to be listening
to every word. - Did I?

411
00:33:04,861 --> 00:33:07,852
I would say...
Not just me, of course, others would say...

412
00:33:07,929 --> 00:33:10,261
...when I was at Princeton...
Grazie.

413
00:33:11,634 --> 00:33:15,593
When I left Princeton, and not just because
I was chairman of the department...

414
00:33:15,671 --> 00:33:18,467
...I think it was the finest math
department in the country.

415
00:33:18,539 --> 00:33:19,768
It was?

416
00:33:20,642 --> 00:33:21,939
The finest?
Because...

417
00:33:22,776 --> 00:33:23,936
I left.

418
00:33:25,646 --> 00:33:27,170
Never mind why.

419
00:33:27,381 --> 00:33:29,315
Okay. I'll tell you.
Woman trouble.

420
00:33:30,751 --> 00:33:33,151
Grad, undergrad,
what's the difference?

421
00:33:33,753 --> 00:33:36,517
Don't ask me, Joe.
I'm the father of two daughters.

422
00:33:36,723 --> 00:33:37,712
There's a headache.

423
00:33:37,857 --> 00:33:41,122
You don't expect them to be virgins
by the time they go to college...

424
00:33:42,194 --> 00:33:43,354
...do you?

425
00:33:45,063 --> 00:33:46,223
Honey.

426
00:33:47,599 --> 00:33:48,657
What?

427
00:33:49,301 --> 00:33:52,531
- That's a good answer.
- No. It's just that they...

428
00:33:52,737 --> 00:33:54,068
- I'll get it.
- No, I'll get it.

429
00:33:54,138 --> 00:33:56,334
No, honey.
I got it!

430
00:33:58,709 --> 00:34:01,473
Boy, she sure comes alive
when the phone rings.

431
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:04,542
Might I suggest lithium?

432
00:34:04,781 --> 00:34:05,874
No.

433
00:34:06,751 --> 00:34:09,377
For Kathy,
aspirin is a psychedelic.

434
00:34:12,855 --> 00:34:15,450
- Hello.
- Hi. This is Tom.

435
00:34:16,660 --> 00:34:18,125
That's not funny.

436
00:34:19,028 --> 00:34:20,393
You've lost your
sense of humor.

437
00:34:21,230 --> 00:34:23,026
I'll laugh when it's funny.

438
00:34:23,097 --> 00:34:25,828
I just wanted to remind you
of Elliott's opening on Friday.

439
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:29,695
Dennis Hopper will be there.
Put your name on the list?

440
00:34:31,105 --> 00:34:32,868
Okay.
I'm not sure we can make it.

441
00:34:34,175 --> 00:34:35,198
Whatever.

442
00:34:37,477 --> 00:34:38,705
Bye.

443
00:34:41,749 --> 00:34:44,944
Anybody been hanging up
when you answer the phone?

444
00:34:46,353 --> 00:34:47,376
Yeah, her mother.

445
00:34:49,388 --> 00:34:50,981
Don't tell Kathy.

446
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:54,888
- Who was that?
- Emily.

447
00:34:56,995 --> 00:34:59,691
Couldn't you two
guys make up?

448
00:35:00,399 --> 00:35:03,230
Historically speaking,
when two women fight...

449
00:35:03,767 --> 00:35:05,065
...it's usually over a man.

450
00:35:05,604 --> 00:35:07,571
- Okay.
- I'm sorry.

451
00:35:07,805 --> 00:35:09,068
Good shot.
Two points.

452
00:35:10,374 --> 00:35:13,035
- Excuse me. I'm sorry.
- That's all right.

453
00:35:25,254 --> 00:35:28,154
- Does Emily know Dennis Hopper?
- I don't know.

454
00:35:28,223 --> 00:35:30,783
'Cause we could be talking to him,
you know.

455
00:35:30,859 --> 00:35:35,228
Does the guy talk?
I don't know. He's short, I know that.

456
00:35:35,530 --> 00:35:39,158
- Short? He looks very tall.
- No, he's very short.

457
00:35:39,233 --> 00:35:43,033
Honey, you're so good at this stuff.
You always know what to say.

458
00:35:43,104 --> 00:35:44,628
There's the bar.

459
00:35:45,105 --> 00:35:47,505
- Go.
- I'll start there.

460
00:36:04,456 --> 00:36:06,946
Would you all excuse me?
Enjoy the show.

461
00:36:09,762 --> 00:36:11,285
It's all yours.

462
00:36:13,564 --> 00:36:15,691
I almost hate to part with it.

463
00:36:15,767 --> 00:36:19,703
- You've made a great discovery in Elliott.
- You have a good eye, Mrs. Konzulman.

464
00:36:19,771 --> 00:36:21,202
Can I have a moment with you?

465
00:36:21,270 --> 00:36:23,796
This is Mrs. Konzulman.
She just bought this piece.

466
00:36:23,874 --> 00:36:25,808
Great.
I hope you enjoy it.

467
00:36:25,876 --> 00:36:28,344
I will.
It's so pretty.

468
00:36:30,914 --> 00:36:35,908
- Yes. What exactly do you...
- We have some business to attend to.

469
00:36:37,086 --> 00:36:38,143
Enjoy it.

470
00:36:39,921 --> 00:36:43,857
"Pretty"? Did she say "pretty"?
No, Elliott, she said "evocative. "

471
00:36:44,025 --> 00:36:47,755
It is evocative and lyrical.
It is evocatively lyrical.

472
00:36:48,128 --> 00:36:49,391
Thank you.

473
00:36:49,631 --> 00:36:54,125
And might I add, you're looking
very evocatively lyrical tonight.

474
00:36:57,203 --> 00:36:59,297
So you want to
consummate the sale?

475
00:37:09,482 --> 00:37:10,506
No.

476
00:37:16,988 --> 00:37:18,353
I miss you.

477
00:37:19,491 --> 00:37:22,050
- I miss this.
- I'm sure you do.

478
00:37:24,095 --> 00:37:25,255
All right, Emily.

479
00:37:25,696 --> 00:37:27,664
I screwed up at Gina's
birthday party.

480
00:37:28,099 --> 00:37:31,966
I'm sorry. But that's it?
No more fun?

481
00:37:34,304 --> 00:37:36,204
I've had plenty of fun.

482
00:37:38,007 --> 00:37:39,872
I need something more.

483
00:37:40,909 --> 00:37:41,898
Okay.

484
00:37:42,611 --> 00:37:43,600
Okay?

485
00:37:44,881 --> 00:37:48,407
So use me until the right guy comes along.

486
00:37:51,152 --> 00:37:52,710
I think he has.

487
00:38:02,730 --> 00:38:04,721
That's all you had to say.

488
00:38:15,707 --> 00:38:18,108
Say, have you seen
Dennis Hopper?

489
00:38:25,450 --> 00:38:29,318
Basically, I added another name to my list,
which I certainly didn't need...

490
00:38:29,387 --> 00:38:32,082
...and I can tell you,
it's another regret.

491
00:38:35,192 --> 00:38:38,059
What can I say, Kathy?
We were swept away.

492
00:38:39,597 --> 00:38:41,654
Tommy doesn't
get swept away.

493
00:38:41,798 --> 00:38:44,324
We spent two years
not getting swept away.

494
00:38:45,568 --> 00:38:49,198
Of course, I don't strip as soon
as I get into a man's apartment.

495
00:38:49,373 --> 00:38:51,635
No.
You only pimp your friends.

496
00:38:52,708 --> 00:38:54,539
You know what I regret
about this thing?

497
00:38:54,610 --> 00:38:58,409
I regret that I told you, and I'm not
going to tell you anything anymore.

498
00:38:59,781 --> 00:39:01,544
$11,000?

499
00:39:46,356 --> 00:39:50,258
I'm sorry about you and Emily.
I hope you guys can still be friends.

500
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:52,087
Yeah, me too.

501
00:39:53,029 --> 00:39:57,864
Although it can be hard being friends if,
say, either of you finds someone else.

502
00:39:58,101 --> 00:39:59,567
You dating anybody new?

503
00:39:59,868 --> 00:40:01,268
No, I'm not.

504
00:40:03,339 --> 00:40:04,805
And Emily...

505
00:40:05,274 --> 00:40:06,741
She is.

506
00:40:07,042 --> 00:40:09,271
But I don't have
to tell you that.

507
00:40:09,543 --> 00:40:11,239
The man from Denver?

508
00:40:11,412 --> 00:40:12,401
She met him in Denver?

509
00:40:12,647 --> 00:40:14,012
What has she told you?

510
00:40:14,249 --> 00:40:16,342
Nothing.
What has she told you, anything?

511
00:40:16,517 --> 00:40:19,111
- There you are.
- Honey, you remember Elliott?

512
00:40:19,187 --> 00:40:21,086
Yeah.
This is great stuff.

513
00:40:21,255 --> 00:40:22,688
Hi, Peter.
Thank you.

514
00:40:24,625 --> 00:40:27,992
- It's a little steep, but it's pretty.
- Pretty?

515
00:40:28,695 --> 00:40:32,130
It's a little claustrophobic in here for me.
Can we go?

516
00:40:32,265 --> 00:40:33,290
Yeah.

517
00:40:33,367 --> 00:40:37,462
Great. Really, good show.
Elliott, beautiful work.

518
00:40:38,604 --> 00:40:40,594
I never saw Dennis Hopper.

519
00:41:03,159 --> 00:41:04,558
Hello, lover.

520
00:41:05,028 --> 00:41:06,757
I'm so glad I came.

521
00:41:10,165 --> 00:41:13,498
You know, I can't believe
that you and Kathy are friends.

522
00:41:14,002 --> 00:41:18,565
You're so much more beautiful
and sophisticated than she is.

523
00:41:23,978 --> 00:41:28,074
I feel sorry for her.
She's such a pathetic little thing.

524
00:41:28,349 --> 00:41:31,044
Yeah.
I can barely remember her.

525
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:38,350
Her hips have really spread
since she had the children.

526
00:41:43,996 --> 00:41:44,984
Honey, what?

527
00:41:45,396 --> 00:41:46,864
It's horrible.

528
00:41:47,967 --> 00:41:50,060
Was it a nightmare?

529
00:41:50,502 --> 00:41:52,367
- It's over.
- No, it's not.

530
00:41:52,438 --> 00:41:54,837
I wish it was, but it's not.

531
00:41:57,909 --> 00:41:59,376
Want some water
or something?

532
00:41:59,477 --> 00:42:00,739
- Promise me!
- What?

533
00:42:00,812 --> 00:42:03,472
- I said promise!
- Okay, I promise.

534
00:42:04,648 --> 00:42:06,878
- What?
- Find someone else for Emily.

535
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:11,411
That's your nightmare?

536
00:42:12,421 --> 00:42:14,616
She's lonely.
She doesn't have anybody.

537
00:42:14,690 --> 00:42:16,089
She doesn't need my help.

538
00:42:16,158 --> 00:42:17,956
Men find her very attractive.

539
00:42:18,028 --> 00:42:20,119
- You promised!
- Okay.

540
00:42:20,428 --> 00:42:22,420
Yeah.
I'll think about it.

541
00:42:29,937 --> 00:42:31,303
Yeah.

542
00:42:35,844 --> 00:42:36,868
No.

543
00:42:40,881 --> 00:42:44,874
So, blah blah blah, and when asked
about this comparison to Einstein...

544
00:42:44,952 --> 00:42:48,408
...Prof. Dubin said:

545
00:42:48,487 --> 00:42:51,480
"Einstein flunked math.
I didn't. "

546
00:42:53,525 --> 00:42:55,493
You can keep that one.
I've got copies.

547
00:42:55,560 --> 00:42:58,961
- I can't find my keys.
- Can't wait to get me inside?

548
00:42:59,064 --> 00:43:02,329
Joe, it's late.

549
00:43:02,434 --> 00:43:07,370
Late, yes. But let me ask you this:
You really don't want me to leave, do you?

550
00:43:07,905 --> 00:43:10,203
I have to get up
early tomorrow.

551
00:43:10,941 --> 00:43:12,273
It's 8:50.

552
00:43:13,376 --> 00:43:16,072
Then how about a
little good-night fuck?

553
00:43:17,481 --> 00:43:18,640
Good night, fuck.

554
00:43:23,652 --> 00:43:26,281
That's good, Emily,
you little minx!

555
00:43:28,290 --> 00:43:29,723
Come on, Emily.

556
00:43:30,159 --> 00:43:34,151
Don't make me beg, okay?
I'm not the type. It doesn't suit me.

557
00:43:34,228 --> 00:43:36,720
All right.
I'll beg. Emily!

558
00:44:17,901 --> 00:44:19,459
Honey, when's dinner?

559
00:44:19,536 --> 00:44:22,300
You want to know when dinner is?
I'll tell you when it is.

560
00:44:22,372 --> 00:44:24,703
It's when we're good and ready.
That's when it is.

561
00:44:24,974 --> 00:44:27,306
We're having brownie stew tonight,
remember?

562
00:44:27,376 --> 00:44:31,438
Or you just remember how to be
waited on and how to stuff your face?

563
00:44:31,515 --> 00:44:33,879
Is that what you think I do
when I leave the house?

564
00:44:33,949 --> 00:44:35,850
I go someplace and
I stuff my face?

565
00:44:36,052 --> 00:44:38,315
I'm sorry I'm taking so long.

566
00:44:38,386 --> 00:44:40,786
Honey, no.
You're doing great.

567
00:44:44,092 --> 00:44:45,423
I work hard for the family.

568
00:44:46,194 --> 00:44:49,685
I'm killing myself trying to separate
oscillations on fractal boundaries.

569
00:44:49,763 --> 00:44:51,390
How very meaningful.

570
00:44:51,799 --> 00:44:53,664
"How very meaningful. "

571
00:44:54,135 --> 00:44:56,797
That brings up an
interesting question...

572
00:44:56,871 --> 00:44:59,930
...because what is
"meaningful"?

573
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:03,273
Regard for each other,
that could be meaningful.

574
00:45:03,643 --> 00:45:05,975
Love, friendship...

575
00:45:06,913 --> 00:45:08,504
...tolerance.

576
00:45:08,881 --> 00:45:11,407
Those things,
they can be meaningful.

577
00:45:14,219 --> 00:45:18,951
Looking at your husband with compassion
in your eyes instead of resentment...

578
00:45:19,023 --> 00:45:20,286
...that could be meaningful.

579
00:45:21,426 --> 00:45:25,828
You act like I did something wrong
or let you down in some way.

580
00:45:25,897 --> 00:45:27,261
If I have,
you should tell me.

581
00:45:28,933 --> 00:45:30,833
You haven't let me down.

582
00:45:32,536 --> 00:45:33,798
It has nothing to do with you.

583
00:45:35,338 --> 00:45:36,736
What's it got to do with?

584
00:45:38,975 --> 00:45:40,704
It's silly.
It's...

585
00:45:42,143 --> 00:45:43,543
Emily and...

586
00:45:44,847 --> 00:45:46,837
That fight is worth all this?

587
00:45:49,852 --> 00:45:52,081
You've been pretty awful lately.

588
00:45:53,755 --> 00:45:56,053
I don't think I deserve it.
Does Emily?

589
00:45:57,492 --> 00:45:58,516
No.

590
00:46:16,876 --> 00:46:18,502
Okay, let's see.

591
00:46:19,145 --> 00:46:21,738
12, 13, 14, 15, 16.

592
00:46:27,318 --> 00:46:28,946
It's over!
I've got a handle on it.

593
00:46:29,020 --> 00:46:31,385
I've got a wonderful life.
I'm keeping it that way.

594
00:46:31,455 --> 00:46:33,083
Tom Andrews is
not a part of it.

595
00:46:33,158 --> 00:46:36,455
He's a part of your life now,
and I can accept that.

596
00:46:38,762 --> 00:46:40,059
Want to come in?

597
00:46:41,799 --> 00:46:44,164
If the two of you
can find happiness together...

598
00:46:44,234 --> 00:46:46,395
...I'm certainly not going
to stand in your way.

599
00:46:46,502 --> 00:46:48,527
What are you talking about?

600
00:46:48,871 --> 00:46:51,635
- You and Tom.
- There is no "me and Tom. "

601
00:46:52,208 --> 00:46:56,644
- But you told Elliott there was a new guy.
- I told him that to get rid of him.

602
00:46:56,845 --> 00:46:58,472
No "you and Tom"?

603
00:46:58,847 --> 00:47:00,509
It was one night.

604
00:47:00,717 --> 00:47:04,481
You had the relationship with him.
I had one night.

605
00:47:08,923 --> 00:47:11,823
I wish it could have worked
out for the two of you.

606
00:47:13,393 --> 00:47:15,191
Kathy, you're so full of shit.

607
00:47:17,163 --> 00:47:20,928
I don't want to talk about me and Tom,
nor about you and Tom.

608
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:24,232
Never mind that pompous asshole
your husband fixed me up with.

609
00:47:24,304 --> 00:47:27,033
If that's what you came here to discuss,
try the mirror.

610
00:47:27,106 --> 00:47:29,199
There's one in the bathroom.

611
00:47:31,342 --> 00:47:33,834
I've really been selfish, haven't I?

612
00:47:36,914 --> 00:47:38,142
I'm sorry.

613
00:47:38,683 --> 00:47:40,674
And I'm pregnant, I think.

614
00:47:42,353 --> 00:47:43,342
Tom?

615
00:47:44,122 --> 00:47:46,146
Elliott.

616
00:47:48,091 --> 00:47:51,993
- How late are you?
- About five years. Shall we?

617
00:47:59,201 --> 00:48:01,328
What is it we're looking for?

618
00:48:02,904 --> 00:48:06,203
If it's positive,
a doughnut forms.

619
00:48:09,845 --> 00:48:11,038
A doughnut?

620
00:48:11,578 --> 00:48:13,774
What do you mean,
like a ring?

621
00:48:15,016 --> 00:48:18,679
Yeah, but they
call it a doughnut.

622
00:48:22,323 --> 00:48:24,757
Why don't they
just call it a ring?

623
00:48:28,062 --> 00:48:32,122
I guess it's a potentially
sensitive subject for some of us.

624
00:48:44,643 --> 00:48:49,444
I know you haven't taken Elliott seriously,
but this might be a good time to start.

625
00:48:49,681 --> 00:48:51,045
Please.

626
00:48:53,150 --> 00:48:55,481
- A doughnut is forming.
- What?

627
00:48:56,319 --> 00:48:57,786
A doughnut...

628
00:48:59,724 --> 00:49:00,747
...is forming.

629
00:49:02,158 --> 00:49:03,751
Emily.

630
00:49:04,127 --> 00:49:05,753
I think I'm going to be sick.

631
00:49:05,894 --> 00:49:09,353
Okay.
Prenatal vitamins and Valium.

632
00:49:10,499 --> 00:49:11,761
Pregnant?

633
00:49:12,768 --> 00:49:13,757
Yes.

634
00:49:14,269 --> 00:49:16,099
You shouldn't take tranquilizers.

635
00:49:16,839 --> 00:49:18,136
I won't be taking both.

636
00:49:20,641 --> 00:49:22,871
"Two hours before procedure. "

637
00:49:23,745 --> 00:49:25,268
Tough decision.

638
00:49:25,980 --> 00:49:27,345
Thank you.

639
00:49:27,482 --> 00:49:28,471
Excuse me.

640
00:49:28,549 --> 00:49:29,641
Good luck!

641
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:42,559
You baby!

642
00:50:27,202 --> 00:50:28,260
Well?

643
00:50:28,737 --> 00:50:30,329
Decision is made.

644
00:50:35,876 --> 00:50:39,244
- Don't start.
- I can't help it.

645
00:50:44,517 --> 00:50:46,508
- When are you gonna tell Elliott?
- Never.

646
00:50:47,654 --> 00:50:50,144
If I'm not sure I'm ready,
you can bet he isn't.

647
00:50:50,222 --> 00:50:52,281
That's not fair.
You gotta ask him.

648
00:50:52,357 --> 00:50:56,054
- If not, it will be a long pregnancy
for me. - Lighten up.

649
00:50:57,163 --> 00:50:58,993
Fasten your seat belts.
Get ready...

650
00:50:59,064 --> 00:51:00,826
- What are you doing?
- Why not?

651
00:51:00,898 --> 00:51:02,924
- No!
- I'm light. All right?

652
00:51:03,001 --> 00:51:05,628
- This is nuts.
- You still gotta tell Elliott.

653
00:51:06,472 --> 00:51:08,564
I can't help it if
I get too involved.

654
00:51:08,639 --> 00:51:10,503
- What are you doing?
- Let's get going.

655
00:51:10,574 --> 00:51:13,169
It'll take 20 minutes
for that Valium to kick in.

656
00:51:13,244 --> 00:51:15,871
- Don't tell Peter.
- "Don't tell Peter. "

657
00:51:23,787 --> 00:51:26,346
She's going to tell him.
She's got to tell him.

658
00:51:27,656 --> 00:51:31,319
She can't not tell him he's the father,
for heaven's sakes.

659
00:51:31,927 --> 00:51:33,554
He's got to know.

660
00:51:34,162 --> 00:51:36,096
It's his baby, too.

661
00:51:36,464 --> 00:51:38,558
Fathers are very important.

662
00:51:42,336 --> 00:51:44,531
Yeah, Elliott's got to know.

663
00:51:47,709 --> 00:51:49,039
Nice pill.

664
00:51:57,417 --> 00:52:00,578
Hello.
You got them.

665
00:52:03,089 --> 00:52:04,953
Yeah.
Is everything okay?

666
00:52:07,026 --> 00:52:08,390
She didn't?

667
00:52:12,097 --> 00:52:14,030
Fifteen minutes.
I'll be there.

668
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:17,031
It's Kathy's car pool day.

669
00:52:17,334 --> 00:52:19,268
She forgot to pick up the kids.

670
00:52:19,336 --> 00:52:21,998
- She's not home.
- Historically speaking, when a wife...

671
00:52:22,072 --> 00:52:24,302
- Joe, save it.
- All right, sir.

672
00:52:42,859 --> 00:52:44,757
Why, who could that be?

673
00:53:07,814 --> 00:53:11,510
Emily, aren't you a
sight for sore eyes?

674
00:53:11,784 --> 00:53:15,345
You were right, Kath.
It's hell out there without a man.

675
00:53:15,454 --> 00:53:18,684
There, there.
Things have a way of working out.

676
00:53:19,991 --> 00:53:22,960
Honey, do we have
enough for company?

677
00:53:24,529 --> 00:53:25,723
Hi, Em!

678
00:53:27,532 --> 00:53:28,520
Staying for dinner?

679
00:53:28,832 --> 00:53:31,494
We were just discussing
her problem.

680
00:53:32,337 --> 00:53:34,827
- Have you told Elliott?
- I can't.

681
00:53:35,405 --> 00:53:36,564
He couldn't handle it.

682
00:53:38,641 --> 00:53:41,132
But he's the father.
He should know.

683
00:53:41,511 --> 00:53:43,375
Elliott's got to know.

684
00:53:45,714 --> 00:53:47,148
Elliott's got to know.

685
00:53:48,116 --> 00:53:49,242
Kathy.

686
00:53:49,451 --> 00:53:52,080
- Elliott's got to know.
- What?

687
00:53:52,488 --> 00:53:53,476
Are you all right?

688
00:53:53,555 --> 00:53:57,082
Peter! What time is it?
Where are the kids?

689
00:53:57,158 --> 00:53:58,146
I got the kids.

690
00:53:58,225 --> 00:54:02,684
It's Tuesday. I got the kids,
because you wanted to sleep on the dryer.

691
00:54:02,762 --> 00:54:05,129
I'm sorry.
I took a Valium.

692
00:54:05,399 --> 00:54:06,423
What?

693
00:54:07,368 --> 00:54:08,892
You took Valium?

694
00:54:10,104 --> 00:54:11,128
Ice cream!

695
00:54:12,804 --> 00:54:14,295
What does Elliott
have to know?

696
00:54:16,342 --> 00:54:18,970
I can't tell you.
I promised Emily I wouldn't.

697
00:54:22,415 --> 00:54:23,540
Are we all right?

698
00:54:24,516 --> 00:54:27,247
Yes!

699
00:54:30,688 --> 00:54:33,521
Boy, "yes" isn't going
to cut it much longer.

700
00:54:35,426 --> 00:54:39,293
At first it seemed as though
the tangential relationship...

701
00:54:39,362 --> 00:54:41,695
...between the spheres
of the y-axis...

702
00:54:42,099 --> 00:54:46,364
...were going to overlap,
and I will be going into that very shortly.

703
00:54:51,574 --> 00:54:54,475
- I know what you're thinking.
- No, you don't.

704
00:54:54,711 --> 00:54:56,678
"Elliott's got to know. "

705
00:54:57,478 --> 00:54:59,504
I'm glad I confided in you.

706
00:54:59,648 --> 00:55:01,115
Jeez.
Listen.

707
00:55:03,918 --> 00:55:04,976
It was a dream.

708
00:55:05,153 --> 00:55:06,882
Dreams don't mean anything.

709
00:55:07,187 --> 00:55:08,519
Really?
Okay.

710
00:55:08,723 --> 00:55:10,953
Here's a little physics
for you, okay?

711
00:55:11,025 --> 00:55:14,050
Remember Newton?
Curly hair, chubby.

712
00:55:14,594 --> 00:55:17,825
"A body at rest stays at rest.
A body in motion stays in motion...

713
00:55:17,898 --> 00:55:19,832
"... unless acted upon
by an outside force. "

714
00:55:20,634 --> 00:55:24,433
I think we both agree,
Kathy is a body in motion.

715
00:55:26,239 --> 00:55:28,103
What are you talking about?

716
00:55:28,708 --> 00:55:29,800
Here.

717
00:55:31,711 --> 00:55:32,734
So?

718
00:55:33,144 --> 00:55:35,579
So "x" equals Kathy.

719
00:55:46,957 --> 00:55:48,321
This isn't Russian lit.

720
00:55:54,765 --> 00:55:56,754
First of all,
if she's not home...

721
00:55:56,832 --> 00:55:58,960
...check if her diaphragm's missing.

722
00:55:59,035 --> 00:56:02,003
I can't believe we're doing this.
Il'll sneak into my house...

723
00:56:02,070 --> 00:56:05,597
...creep down the hallway and
catch my wife folding my socks.

724
00:56:05,674 --> 00:56:07,801
Don't forget to check
behind the shower curtain.

725
00:56:07,876 --> 00:56:10,208
That isn't where she folds socks.

726
00:56:15,349 --> 00:56:16,839
All right.
Quiet.

727
00:56:17,384 --> 00:56:19,249
She didn't say anything
about going out.

728
00:56:19,320 --> 00:56:20,548
They never do.

729
00:56:25,926 --> 00:56:28,393
I think you were right.
She was alone.

730
00:56:28,595 --> 00:56:31,496
A woman won't go during the
day on a cheap tryst in a motel...

731
00:56:31,564 --> 00:56:35,500
...because you're at work
and the kids are at school. You're fine.

732
00:56:49,647 --> 00:56:51,546
- What's that? What did you say?
- Nothing.

733
00:56:51,615 --> 00:56:52,947
I thought you said something.

734
00:56:53,017 --> 00:56:56,009
- She's probably going to Safeway.
- She probably is.

735
00:57:00,157 --> 00:57:01,146
Isn't that Safeway?

736
00:57:04,161 --> 00:57:05,822
Bye-bye, Safeway.

737
00:57:06,530 --> 00:57:09,020
She's going to another store.
Lighten up. I'm sure.

738
00:57:09,098 --> 00:57:10,999
You think all she
does is shopping.

739
00:57:11,067 --> 00:57:14,297
- I make it sound like nothing.
- There's more to her life than that.

740
00:57:14,370 --> 00:57:15,701
I'm certain there is.

741
00:57:15,771 --> 00:57:19,638
Her life's not so empty that she
has to have a cheap affair with a kid...

742
00:57:19,707 --> 00:57:23,074
...just because he's young
and sensitive with blue eyes.

743
00:57:24,112 --> 00:57:25,136
You're losing her.

744
00:57:25,213 --> 00:57:26,611
I got her.

745
00:57:40,260 --> 00:57:44,696
Unless her aerobics class meets
down here, we're onto something.

746
00:57:50,968 --> 00:57:51,958
Bingo.

747
00:58:05,149 --> 00:58:06,309
Look at the name!

748
00:58:08,985 --> 00:58:10,180
Go!

749
00:58:28,670 --> 00:58:31,103
Looks like what we have
here is a first time.

750
00:58:31,172 --> 00:58:33,664
I know Kathy.
She's not going to go in.

751
00:58:39,513 --> 00:58:41,742
Cheer up.
He might be a bad lay.

752
00:58:46,987 --> 00:58:50,115
- I've never been in an
artist's studio before. - No?

753
00:58:52,524 --> 00:58:54,151
Well, this is it.

754
00:58:55,493 --> 00:58:59,294
- Just go ahead. Do whatever you're...
- Yeah, sure.

755
00:59:08,139 --> 00:59:10,107
I could do this one of two ways:

756
00:59:10,173 --> 00:59:15,111
I could feel you out,
test the waters...

757
00:59:15,178 --> 00:59:18,510
...see how you might react
to marrying Emily...

758
00:59:18,949 --> 00:59:20,813
...and raising a family...

759
00:59:24,354 --> 00:59:28,449
...or skip all that and just blurt out that
Emily's pregnant and having your baby.

760
00:59:30,425 --> 00:59:33,987
Or I could just mind my own
business and not say a word.

761
00:59:35,063 --> 00:59:36,689
- Wait!
- Bye, Elliott!

762
00:59:36,764 --> 00:59:37,754
Bye.

763
00:59:43,238 --> 00:59:46,070
Nothing happened.
It was only a couple minutes.

764
00:59:46,273 --> 00:59:49,265
Unless, of course,
he's a really bad lay.

765
00:59:52,980 --> 00:59:54,276
See?

766
00:59:54,347 --> 00:59:57,714
Come on!
You hungry?

767
01:00:26,343 --> 01:00:27,743
Kathy?
Hi, it's Elliott.

768
01:00:27,878 --> 01:00:29,174
Hi, Elliott.

769
01:00:30,846 --> 01:00:33,509
I gotta come over and talk
to you about the situation.

770
01:00:34,084 --> 01:00:37,053
This isn't really a good
time for me to talk.

771
01:00:38,187 --> 01:00:39,313
No, don't leave me hanging.

772
01:00:39,554 --> 01:00:40,715
I'm dying here.

773
01:00:41,423 --> 01:00:42,890
How about tomorrow?

774
01:00:46,494 --> 01:00:47,984
Fine.

775
01:00:48,062 --> 01:00:49,154
Craters?

776
01:00:49,230 --> 01:00:51,698
- You know where that is?
- Yeah.

777
01:00:52,500 --> 01:00:55,366
1:00. Great.
You'll be there, right?

778
01:00:55,435 --> 01:00:58,427
You won't drop another bomb
and run out on me again?

779
01:01:02,309 --> 01:01:04,243
Relax, I'll be there.
Bye.

780
01:01:15,286 --> 01:01:16,310
How's it going?

781
01:01:19,058 --> 01:01:20,285
Well...

782
01:01:21,826 --> 01:01:23,953
Johnson's Mortuary is
in the black this month.

783
01:01:25,896 --> 01:01:27,091
Amazing.

784
01:01:41,811 --> 01:01:45,872
This is making me crazy.
What makes her think she's alone in this?

785
01:01:46,416 --> 01:01:49,851
And she's out there somewhere
right now in this city...

786
01:01:49,918 --> 01:01:52,853
...walking around
with a piece of me inside her.

787
01:01:53,355 --> 01:01:57,051
And I'm so angry,
but I also want to protect her...

788
01:01:57,124 --> 01:01:58,955
...but I don't even
know what from.

789
01:02:00,161 --> 01:02:02,459
God...
I'm okay.

790
01:02:03,031 --> 01:02:05,725
I don't know exactly
what a father does...

791
01:02:06,266 --> 01:02:08,167
...as if she'd even let me.

792
01:02:08,269 --> 01:02:12,262
She's so damn independent,
but that's what I like!

793
01:02:12,740 --> 01:02:14,933
So should I...

794
01:02:15,374 --> 01:02:16,842
Should I call her?

795
01:02:16,976 --> 01:02:18,603
Should I tell her I know?

796
01:02:21,047 --> 01:02:22,844
Should I be drinking?

797
01:02:24,849 --> 01:02:28,308
- I shouldn't have told you.
- No. She should have told me.

798
01:02:28,853 --> 01:02:31,913
Maybe she didn't want
to put you in this position.

799
01:02:33,224 --> 01:02:35,886
But I am in this position...

800
01:02:36,894 --> 01:02:38,054
...and...

801
01:02:40,497 --> 01:02:42,829
...I don't know what
to do about it.

802
01:02:44,935 --> 01:02:47,665
Before you confront
Emily about the baby...

803
01:02:48,538 --> 01:02:51,199
...you've got to find out
what's there between you...

804
01:02:51,273 --> 01:02:52,604
...without the baby.

805
01:02:55,044 --> 01:02:57,239
- She's busy, Elliott!
- I know.

806
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:01,373
Carol, that will be all.
Thank you.

807
01:03:01,951 --> 01:03:03,179
I'd like to talk about us.

808
01:03:05,453 --> 01:03:07,512
I want to talk about you.

809
01:03:15,162 --> 01:03:16,629
We had a good thing going.

810
01:03:16,697 --> 01:03:20,097
No ties, no talk of the future
from either of us...

811
01:03:20,166 --> 01:03:22,158
...and it was nice.

812
01:03:22,236 --> 01:03:25,102
It felt good.

813
01:03:27,473 --> 01:03:29,998
We liked each other.
Now suddenly, I'm out on my ass...

814
01:03:30,076 --> 01:03:32,601
...because you decide it
should be something else.

815
01:03:32,678 --> 01:03:36,579
Fine, but on top of that,
you decide I can't handle "something else. "

816
01:03:36,648 --> 01:03:39,173
So at this point,
you're trying to tell me my limits.

817
01:03:39,251 --> 01:03:42,651
I'll tell you something, lady.
The only limits we've proven are yours.

818
01:03:42,720 --> 01:03:46,178
- Elliott, when you reach my age...
- That's crap! Sit down!

819
01:03:47,592 --> 01:03:49,923
You're not 95.
Age has nothing to do with it.

820
01:03:52,863 --> 01:03:56,263
If I was auditioning for something,
you should have told me.

821
01:03:56,332 --> 01:03:58,823
You should've given
me that chance.

822
01:04:03,705 --> 01:04:05,070
That's all.

823
01:04:05,541 --> 01:04:06,600
I...

824
01:04:09,277 --> 01:04:10,939
Are you saying you
want an audition?

825
01:04:17,685 --> 01:04:19,379
You'd have to audition,
too, you know.

826
01:04:22,190 --> 01:04:23,656
That seems fair.

827
01:04:40,906 --> 01:04:43,430
What a perfectly glorious day!

828
01:04:44,976 --> 01:04:49,709
Hello. I'd like to welcome all of you
to the Odd Couples Lamaze class.

829
01:04:50,215 --> 01:04:52,410
I like to meet mothers
in their second month...

830
01:04:52,482 --> 01:04:55,576
...so we can talk about nutrition
and prenatal care.

831
01:04:56,387 --> 01:04:59,287
Then you can all go off
and grow those babies...

832
01:04:59,423 --> 01:05:01,414
...and come back to me
in your seventh month.

833
01:05:01,491 --> 01:05:03,958
Then we can get down to the fun stuff:

834
01:05:07,330 --> 01:05:10,356
My name is Maggie Sand.
I'm a Capricorn.

835
01:05:10,433 --> 01:05:13,697
I have four children,
ranging in age from 23 down to 2.

836
01:05:14,670 --> 01:05:18,070
Each has a different father,
and I've never been married.

837
01:05:19,541 --> 01:05:21,975
Don't laugh.
That's me in 10 years.

838
01:05:22,077 --> 01:05:26,411
Let's all take turns and tell
something about ourselves...

839
01:05:26,881 --> 01:05:29,678
...and share the circumstances
which have brought us here.

840
01:05:31,118 --> 01:05:33,143
How about you young people?

841
01:05:33,354 --> 01:05:36,345
Hi.
My name is Jill Topial...

842
01:05:36,422 --> 01:05:39,084
...and this is my brother, Alex.

843
01:05:39,726 --> 01:05:41,387
He's going to be my coach.

844
01:05:42,295 --> 01:05:45,923
I like parties on the beach,
New Kids on the Block...

845
01:05:45,998 --> 01:05:48,899
...and my favorite
color is lemon yellow.

846
01:05:49,635 --> 01:05:52,968
It's my science project,
and if she's late with it...

847
01:05:53,038 --> 01:05:54,868
...I'm in deep shit.

848
01:05:57,341 --> 01:06:00,402
You be sure to get back
to us about that grade.

849
01:06:03,346 --> 01:06:06,838
Quite simply,
I am carrying the gift of life.

850
01:06:07,450 --> 01:06:11,648
Mr. and Mrs. Moyer were unable
to have a child of their own...

851
01:06:11,721 --> 01:06:14,622
...and so Mr. Moyer's seed
has been deposited within me.

852
01:06:15,558 --> 01:06:16,785
Mr. and Mrs. Moyer...

853
01:06:16,859 --> 01:06:20,158
...you must be experiencing
the most interesting feelings.

854
01:06:20,229 --> 01:06:22,754
Would you care to
share them with us?

855
01:06:22,998 --> 01:06:24,226
- Well...
- No.

856
01:06:33,574 --> 01:06:34,836
You go ahead.

857
01:06:35,043 --> 01:06:37,375
Hi.
I'm Debbie Rollins...

858
01:06:37,445 --> 01:06:39,935
...and this is my wife Linda.

859
01:06:41,349 --> 01:06:44,044
We just celebrated
our seventh anniversary...

860
01:06:44,351 --> 01:06:46,478
...and Debbie got
a big promotion.

861
01:06:46,552 --> 01:06:49,989
We felt that having a baby
was the next natural step.

862
01:06:51,291 --> 01:06:54,522
I have such a good
feeling about you two.

863
01:06:57,729 --> 01:07:01,392
- And our last couple.
- We're just good friends.

864
01:07:05,370 --> 01:07:08,737
My name is Emily.
This is my best friend, Kathy, and...

865
01:07:09,674 --> 01:07:12,870
I found myself pregnant,
and I've always wanted a child, so...

866
01:07:12,976 --> 01:07:15,376
Well, I'm getting one.

867
01:07:21,483 --> 01:07:23,611
I was born on the cusp.

868
01:07:28,358 --> 01:07:29,518
Okay.

869
01:07:29,826 --> 01:07:34,023
Now, I want you all to write down
everything you've eaten today.

870
01:07:36,198 --> 01:07:39,462
Good nutrition begins
with what I like to call...

871
01:07:39,767 --> 01:07:41,065
...good food IQ.

872
01:07:41,736 --> 01:07:43,499
Does spelling count?

873
01:07:45,374 --> 01:07:48,102
You don't belong here, Em.
You're not an odd couple.

874
01:07:48,174 --> 01:07:51,541
- Elliott should be with you.
- I'm thinking about it.

875
01:07:51,745 --> 01:07:54,510
You are?
Did the two of you talk?

876
01:07:54,582 --> 01:07:57,879
He did. I thought he
had a lot of good points.

877
01:07:57,950 --> 01:08:00,613
Good.
I'm so glad he came through.

878
01:08:03,289 --> 01:08:04,381
What?

879
01:08:04,624 --> 01:08:05,715
You told him.

880
01:08:07,826 --> 01:08:11,488
Emily, you're going to need help.
Parenting is a two-person job.

881
01:08:11,562 --> 01:08:13,326
- I know. I'm a mother.
- So am I!

882
01:08:13,399 --> 01:08:16,765
- No, you're not. Not yet.
- Kathy, get a life.

883
01:08:17,301 --> 01:08:19,735
Stay out of mine!
God, you're like a disease.

884
01:08:19,804 --> 01:08:21,897
You invade someone's life
and attach yourself.

885
01:08:22,673 --> 01:08:25,197
That's what I am to you,
a disease?

886
01:08:25,542 --> 01:08:27,339
Thank you very much!

887
01:08:28,678 --> 01:08:30,908
Go ahead!
Cut the baby off from his father!

888
01:08:32,114 --> 01:08:35,107
I have news for you:
I lied. It's not his baby.

889
01:08:35,985 --> 01:08:38,215
- What do you mean?
- What do you think I mean?

890
01:08:38,287 --> 01:08:40,017
You're having my
boyfriend's baby?

891
01:08:40,556 --> 01:08:43,353
Your boyfriend?
He's not your anything.

892
01:08:43,525 --> 01:08:47,359
You're not part of his life anymore.
He hasn't thought of you in ages!

893
01:08:48,329 --> 01:08:51,092
You think if I showed up
on his doorstep right now...

894
01:08:51,165 --> 01:08:53,726
...he wouldn't get me into
bed as fast as he did you?

895
01:08:53,835 --> 01:08:55,893
If he was smart, he'd run!

896
01:08:57,404 --> 01:08:58,769
No, he wouldn't!

897
01:09:03,877 --> 01:09:06,367
I got a good feeling
about you two.

898
01:09:11,751 --> 01:09:16,016
Tom, there's something very serious
that you have to know...

899
01:09:16,121 --> 01:09:18,749
...and I'm the only
one who will tell you.

900
01:09:19,624 --> 01:09:22,616
A child has been conceived.

901
01:09:25,830 --> 01:09:27,730
Not in love, perhaps.

902
01:09:29,534 --> 01:09:32,798
But in passion.

903
01:09:34,171 --> 01:09:38,801
Now, I understand that
you were swept away...

904
01:09:39,743 --> 01:09:41,437
...but Emily needs you.

905
01:09:43,379 --> 01:09:47,748
Maybe you haven't given her
another thought since your night together.

906
01:09:49,085 --> 01:09:51,278
In fact,
I'm sure you haven't.

907
01:09:53,355 --> 01:09:55,914
Call me invasive.

908
01:09:57,693 --> 01:09:59,592
Call me disease-like.

909
01:10:02,230 --> 01:10:06,189
I just thought that
you deserved to know.

910
01:10:22,348 --> 01:10:23,940
Carol, hi.
Guess who?

911
01:10:24,217 --> 01:10:25,807
Hi, Elliott.

912
01:10:27,318 --> 01:10:29,287
No.
Emily's not here.

913
01:10:30,121 --> 01:10:31,679
Is she going to Denver?

914
01:10:34,526 --> 01:10:37,426
Gee, I really can't
say for sure.

915
01:10:38,096 --> 01:10:39,722
It's pretty confused
around here.

916
01:10:40,797 --> 01:10:43,062
Okay.
Bye, Elliott.

917
01:10:47,304 --> 01:10:49,931
Excuse me.
This is for you.

918
01:10:50,006 --> 01:10:51,337
Thank you.

919
01:10:53,709 --> 01:10:55,767
"There is someone else. "

920
01:10:57,280 --> 01:10:59,180
"You're not the father. "

921
01:11:13,494 --> 01:11:14,483
What?

922
01:11:15,162 --> 01:11:18,256
Kathy's visiting her
mother in Chicago, I'm sure.

923
01:11:18,332 --> 01:11:20,663
Come on, Joe,
there are good marriages.

924
01:11:20,733 --> 01:11:22,325
I know.
I had three of them.

925
01:11:27,106 --> 01:11:30,438
Old town, please.
The number for Elliott Fowler.

926
01:11:31,410 --> 01:11:32,742
Thank you.

927
01:11:37,783 --> 01:11:39,045
I'm just checking.

928
01:11:39,117 --> 01:11:41,950
- Checking is good.
- Message.

929
01:11:45,422 --> 01:11:49,119
Elliott's in Denver for a show.
He's staying at the Hyatt.

930
01:11:49,192 --> 01:11:50,420
Nice place.

931
01:11:50,727 --> 01:11:52,855
What airline is Kathy taking?

932
01:11:53,797 --> 01:11:56,197
I am not gonna dignify
that with an answer.

933
01:11:59,635 --> 01:12:01,661
- Pan-Pacific.
- Thank you.

934
01:12:02,871 --> 01:12:04,394
They fly to Denver,
don't they?

935
01:12:06,308 --> 01:12:08,969
I'm just saying.
I saw it in a commercial, that's all.

936
01:12:10,379 --> 01:12:12,972
All right.
I'll clear this up for you.

937
01:12:25,525 --> 01:12:27,994
Doing a little hacking
in your spare time?

938
01:12:28,961 --> 01:12:30,451
Go.

939
01:12:30,830 --> 01:12:32,389
And the password is...

940
01:12:36,370 --> 01:12:38,802
Pan-Pacific Airlines,
passenger manifest.

941
01:12:38,870 --> 01:12:39,962
Very good.

942
01:12:40,872 --> 01:12:43,341
Let's see.
We'll search...

943
01:12:44,576 --> 01:12:46,044
...for passenger...

944
01:12:46,878 --> 01:12:48,106
...Whiting.

945
01:12:50,548 --> 01:12:53,244
"Whiting, Mrs. "
That's a good sign.

946
01:12:54,919 --> 01:12:57,409
Flight 305, Portland to...

947
01:12:59,690 --> 01:13:00,748
Portland to Denver.

948
01:13:11,501 --> 01:13:14,560
So when you told me it was me,
you thought it was me.

949
01:13:15,103 --> 01:13:17,333
Because Emily was
protecting your feelings.

950
01:13:17,407 --> 01:13:18,395
Yes.

951
01:13:18,473 --> 01:13:23,274
Which means your boyfriend is
the father of my girlfriend's baby.

952
01:13:24,645 --> 01:13:27,809
If you want to boil it down
to one sentence, yes.

953
01:13:28,283 --> 01:13:30,476
You must be just
a little bit relieved.

954
01:13:30,550 --> 01:13:32,985
Relieved that Emily got
knocked up by another man?

955
01:13:33,054 --> 01:13:35,351
No, I would not
say I was relieved.

956
01:13:35,455 --> 01:13:37,890
I'm sorry,
your room won't be ready until 4:00.

957
01:13:40,794 --> 01:13:42,853
Elliott, can you park my bag?

958
01:13:43,796 --> 01:13:46,857
- Sure.
- Great. Thanks. Bye.

959
01:13:46,933 --> 01:13:47,990
Thank you.

960
01:14:16,225 --> 01:14:17,750
"Gone fishing. "

961
01:14:21,865 --> 01:14:23,490
Bullhead catfish?

962
01:14:26,736 --> 01:14:28,225
They're twins!

963
01:14:42,015 --> 01:14:43,311
Who's that, Tommy?

964
01:14:43,382 --> 01:14:45,146
This one's Carol.

965
01:14:46,754 --> 01:14:48,186
Sir?

966
01:15:20,651 --> 01:15:21,743
Damn.

967
01:15:23,553 --> 01:15:25,043
Let me give you a hand.

968
01:15:25,989 --> 01:15:29,446
I'll have this for you in a second.
No problem, darling.

969
01:15:36,532 --> 01:15:37,862
Thank you.

970
01:15:39,968 --> 01:15:41,162
Anytime.

971
01:15:42,103 --> 01:15:43,627
Thank you.

972
01:15:43,905 --> 01:15:46,999
What a beauty,
but not good enough, I'm afraid.

973
01:15:47,607 --> 01:15:49,371
Now this one...

974
01:15:50,244 --> 01:15:52,176
This one is truly pathetic.

975
01:15:52,746 --> 01:15:54,236
Mean mouth on this girl.

976
01:15:54,314 --> 01:15:55,872
Who's that, Tommy?

977
01:15:55,949 --> 01:15:58,008
Who is it?
Chrissy!

978
01:16:00,519 --> 01:16:01,987
Chrissy!

979
01:16:02,421 --> 01:16:05,185
- What you got there, Bootsie?
- Just a fish.

980
01:16:05,691 --> 01:16:07,625
That's no fish!

981
01:16:07,760 --> 01:16:10,353
Look at this thing.
That's a Mack truck.

982
01:16:13,865 --> 01:16:15,561
I need a hand with this one.

983
01:16:15,634 --> 01:16:19,659
Boys, I think we got a
winner at 24 pounds.

984
01:16:22,639 --> 01:16:24,266
I christen you...

985
01:16:25,276 --> 01:16:27,299
Go ahead, Bootsie.
You take it.

986
01:16:28,211 --> 01:16:30,043
- Lola?
- Lola!

987
01:16:30,280 --> 01:16:32,247
Lola!
Right!

988
01:16:32,315 --> 01:16:35,182
Lola.
There's the winner.

989
01:16:35,651 --> 01:16:37,379
Give him a big hand.

990
01:16:45,393 --> 01:16:46,382
Kathy?

991
01:16:46,461 --> 01:16:47,450
Tommy.

992
01:16:48,163 --> 01:16:49,221
Okay, guys.

993
01:16:49,297 --> 01:16:51,891
I'm gonna get out of
here because you stink.

994
01:16:53,634 --> 01:16:54,794
Thanks, Tom.

995
01:16:57,171 --> 01:16:58,729
See you next year, Tom.

996
01:16:58,806 --> 01:17:00,068
Kathy.

997
01:17:05,846 --> 01:17:08,575
It's so good to see you!
What are you doing here?

998
01:17:08,648 --> 01:17:13,084
What, are you kidding?
Me, miss a big moosehead cat thing?

999
01:17:20,959 --> 01:17:22,050
So...

1000
01:17:23,227 --> 01:17:26,061
- Are you divorced?
- No.

1001
01:17:28,466 --> 01:17:29,694
Widowed?

1002
01:17:30,434 --> 01:17:31,457
No.

1003
01:17:33,437 --> 01:17:36,370
So I guess this is
just a friendly call.

1004
01:17:39,409 --> 01:17:41,774
Are you going to
go to the reunion?

1005
01:17:41,978 --> 01:17:43,775
Here, let me get this.

1006
01:17:46,215 --> 01:17:47,614
The reunion.

1007
01:17:50,452 --> 01:17:52,215
I'll tell you...

1008
01:17:52,955 --> 01:17:54,922
The only person I
wanted to see was you...

1009
01:17:55,791 --> 01:17:57,587
...and you're right here.

1010
01:17:58,493 --> 01:17:59,824
I sure am.

1011
01:18:00,629 --> 01:18:01,720
Yeah.

1012
01:18:03,096 --> 01:18:06,964
You know, of all the places I've
imagined running into you again...

1013
01:18:07,034 --> 01:18:08,661
...that dock sure
wasn't one of them.

1014
01:18:09,203 --> 01:18:11,000
You've imagined me places?

1015
01:18:11,404 --> 01:18:12,666
Yeah.

1016
01:18:13,840 --> 01:18:15,637
Haven't you wondered
about me like that?

1017
01:18:16,208 --> 01:18:17,539
- No.
- No?

1018
01:18:19,446 --> 01:18:20,434
Okay.

1019
01:18:21,446 --> 01:18:22,640
I have.

1020
01:18:24,083 --> 01:18:28,985
If I'd known you'd turn out like this,
I'd have imagined it a lot more often.

1021
01:18:30,188 --> 01:18:33,282
What do you mean,
"like this"?

1022
01:18:34,926 --> 01:18:38,292
I always thought you were
the prettiest girl in school.

1023
01:18:39,730 --> 01:18:41,357
And now look at you.

1024
01:18:41,832 --> 01:18:43,959
Just take a look at yourself.

1025
01:18:44,768 --> 01:18:46,257
You're such...

1026
01:18:47,437 --> 01:18:48,665
You're such a woman.

1027
01:18:50,441 --> 01:18:53,807
You have this assurance about you,
and this...

1028
01:18:54,444 --> 01:18:56,570
I don't know,
this sleekness.

1029
01:18:58,213 --> 01:18:59,704
Don't get me started here.

1030
01:18:59,782 --> 01:19:01,373
No, go on.

1031
01:19:07,388 --> 01:19:12,382
Let's just say I'm regretting
all that restraint I used...

1032
01:19:12,625 --> 01:19:13,923
...in high school.

1033
01:19:14,095 --> 01:19:15,721
Tell me about it.

1034
01:19:21,067 --> 01:19:23,331
Yeah.
Okay.

1035
01:19:27,107 --> 01:19:31,132
Am I going to take you out to dinner
with fish gunk on me, or without?

1036
01:19:32,978 --> 01:19:34,206
Without.

1037
01:19:40,852 --> 01:19:42,149
I'm glad you're...

1038
01:19:42,487 --> 01:19:43,681
Peter?

1039
01:19:44,188 --> 01:19:45,485
Where is she?

1040
01:19:47,091 --> 01:19:50,083
- What do you know about it?
- I know.

1041
01:19:50,427 --> 01:19:53,123
I know a lot more
than you think I know.

1042
01:19:54,132 --> 01:19:56,224
Did you know she's pregnant?

1043
01:19:57,800 --> 01:19:58,859
What?

1044
01:20:00,236 --> 01:20:01,794
And it's not even mine.

1045
01:20:02,238 --> 01:20:04,969
Peter, if you were me,
would you still want her?

1046
01:20:05,075 --> 01:20:06,540
I can't help it.

1047
01:20:11,346 --> 01:20:12,780
What the hell do you care?

1048
01:20:13,482 --> 01:20:14,743
She's my wife!

1049
01:20:15,215 --> 01:20:18,117
Kathy?
I'm not talking about Kathy!

1050
01:20:19,987 --> 01:20:21,580
What about this?

1051
01:20:22,223 --> 01:20:24,019
I'm storing it for her, Peter.

1052
01:20:24,224 --> 01:20:25,520
Do you think I'm an idiot?

1053
01:20:25,658 --> 01:20:28,389
No, wait. Hold on.
Just chill, all right?

1054
01:20:28,462 --> 01:20:32,261
Your wife is here to look up an
old high-school boyfriend, Tom.

1055
01:20:32,432 --> 01:20:34,229
- Tom?
- Tom...

1056
01:20:34,634 --> 01:20:35,623
Tom Andrews.

1057
01:20:36,602 --> 01:20:38,467
Tom Andrews.
Okay? So just chill.

1058
01:20:38,871 --> 01:20:41,532
Okay.

1059
01:20:42,641 --> 01:20:44,108
Andrews.

1060
01:20:44,943 --> 01:20:46,274
We'll see.

1061
01:20:47,846 --> 01:20:48,836
All right.

1062
01:20:49,081 --> 01:20:50,707
What a nightmare.

1063
01:20:52,616 --> 01:20:54,278
All right.

1064
01:20:54,852 --> 01:20:56,786
"Andrews, Tom. "

1065
01:21:15,770 --> 01:21:17,636
Kath.
Get that, will you?

1066
01:21:32,687 --> 01:21:33,744
Bye.

1067
01:21:37,991 --> 01:21:39,618
I'm really sorry.

1068
01:21:49,169 --> 01:21:52,604
Fowler.
I need ice badly.

1069
01:21:53,873 --> 01:21:55,669
Big bucket.
Thank you.

1070
01:22:05,516 --> 01:22:07,485
- Elliott.
- Just tell me one thing...

1071
01:22:07,552 --> 01:22:10,110
- Who are you here to see? Me?
- What do you mean?

1072
01:22:10,219 --> 01:22:12,245
- Tom Andrews.
- What?

1073
01:22:12,322 --> 01:22:14,346
Peter, Kathy...
Just tell me.

1074
01:22:14,724 --> 01:22:16,022
Is Kathy in Denver?

1075
01:22:16,093 --> 01:22:18,151
Yes. She's with Tom.

1076
01:22:18,427 --> 01:22:21,055
Peter went out to find her.
He hit me in the face.

1077
01:22:21,130 --> 01:22:24,257
- Now, you and I, we're going to talk, Em.
- Kathy's with Tom?

1078
01:22:25,134 --> 01:22:26,122
Bingo.

1079
01:22:27,269 --> 01:22:29,294
I am through being an idiot.

1080
01:22:29,404 --> 01:22:32,532
You know, listening to other people.
You and I will...

1081
01:22:40,247 --> 01:22:42,579
There's nothing
like a fire, is there?

1082
01:22:45,652 --> 01:22:49,418
You look especially
good by firelight.

1083
01:22:52,592 --> 01:22:55,890
Gosh, it's too bad
it'll go to waste...

1084
01:22:56,696 --> 01:23:01,098
...since we'll be going out
in a few minutes for dinner.

1085
01:23:01,200 --> 01:23:03,065
Why don't we order in?

1086
01:23:04,268 --> 01:23:06,703
You'll find some menus
on the butcher block.

1087
01:23:48,243 --> 01:23:49,675
How about Thai?

1088
01:23:50,244 --> 01:23:52,509
All right.
How about Italian?

1089
01:23:56,617 --> 01:24:00,383
There's an extra $20 if you get
me there before her husband.

1090
01:24:07,493 --> 01:24:09,791
What's the problem here?

1091
01:24:09,862 --> 01:24:12,694
There's more than
one "Elm," son.

1092
01:24:18,302 --> 01:24:21,760
The idea here is to relax.

1093
01:24:23,707 --> 01:24:26,232
Just let me work
the pressure points.

1094
01:24:28,145 --> 01:24:33,138
Just pretend your
hand is your body.

1095
01:24:35,285 --> 01:24:36,616
That's it.

1096
01:24:41,023 --> 01:24:43,082
I remember your hands, Kathy.

1097
01:24:45,795 --> 01:24:47,694
I remember your skin...

1098
01:24:49,764 --> 01:24:50,925
...and your shoulders...

1099
01:24:52,933 --> 01:24:54,264
...your neck...

1100
01:24:55,770 --> 01:24:57,101
...your lips...

1101
01:25:07,514 --> 01:25:09,106
I want you, Kathy.

1102
01:25:12,717 --> 01:25:14,686
Emily's having your baby.

1103
01:25:16,021 --> 01:25:17,352
Excuse me?

1104
01:25:17,956 --> 01:25:20,049
You're going to be a father.

1105
01:25:20,259 --> 01:25:22,089
I knew you'd want to know.

1106
01:25:22,160 --> 01:25:24,924
And you wouldn't want
a child of yours born...

1107
01:25:24,996 --> 01:25:26,429
...and not know about it.

1108
01:25:26,497 --> 01:25:29,660
No, actually,
that's always been a dream of mine.

1109
01:25:35,305 --> 01:25:37,103
Did Emily send you
here to tell me this?

1110
01:25:37,708 --> 01:25:41,337
No. She's gonna kill me
when she finds out.

1111
01:25:43,112 --> 01:25:47,810
She doesn't have to find out.
We'll just say that you never came here.

1112
01:25:48,149 --> 01:25:52,314
She won't know you betrayed her trust
and I won't have to deal with a kid.

1113
01:25:52,387 --> 01:25:53,684
You can't mean that.

1114
01:25:53,988 --> 01:25:56,253
If Emily wanted me to know,
she'd have told me.

1115
01:25:56,324 --> 01:26:00,090
I think the fact that she isn't here
should tell us both something.

1116
01:26:08,235 --> 01:26:10,328
- Hey! Babe.
- Hey! Yourself.

1117
01:26:11,305 --> 01:26:12,465
Kathy.

1118
01:26:13,307 --> 01:26:14,568
Is there a back way out?

1119
01:26:14,640 --> 01:26:17,200
- What are you doing here?
- What am I doing here?

1120
01:26:17,276 --> 01:26:19,506
Why don't we sit down
and talk about this quietly?

1121
01:26:19,579 --> 01:26:22,173
Because her husband will walk
in that door any second!

1122
01:26:22,948 --> 01:26:24,347
- Shit.
- Peter?

1123
01:26:24,416 --> 01:26:26,351
Good for you.
Now, where's the back way?

1124
01:26:26,419 --> 01:26:28,010
There isn't one.

1125
01:26:28,353 --> 01:26:29,513
We'll just have to wing it.

1126
01:26:32,022 --> 01:26:33,011
All right.

1127
01:26:35,092 --> 01:26:37,788
Say you came to tell Tom
he's the father of my baby.

1128
01:26:37,862 --> 01:26:39,193
That's why I did come here!

1129
01:26:39,263 --> 01:26:41,958
Right.
Not looking like that, you didn't.

1130
01:26:42,098 --> 01:26:43,827
No, really.
I just told him!

1131
01:26:43,900 --> 01:26:46,233
It's the eleventh hour.
Cut the crap.

1132
01:26:47,237 --> 01:26:48,534
Give me your dress.

1133
01:26:49,939 --> 01:26:52,133
- Turn around.
- Why are you doing this for me?

1134
01:26:52,207 --> 01:26:54,733
Don't tell me it's because
you love me and forgive me.

1135
01:26:54,811 --> 01:26:58,143
I couldn't bear the guilt.
So don't tell me that is the reason.

1136
01:26:58,247 --> 01:27:00,807
It's because I love
you and forgive you.

1137
01:27:02,350 --> 01:27:04,012
You deserved that.

1138
01:27:04,520 --> 01:27:05,919
Holy mother!

1139
01:27:08,790 --> 01:27:10,417
We'll laugh about
this when we're 90.

1140
01:27:15,362 --> 01:27:16,795
God. Elliott.

1141
01:27:16,897 --> 01:27:19,491
You thought I wasn't ready
for a relationship.

1142
01:27:20,333 --> 01:27:22,801
- How many more guys you
got out there? - Excuse me?

1143
01:27:23,270 --> 01:27:25,066
Boy, I tell you, women...

1144
01:27:25,505 --> 01:27:27,529
Sometimes I just don't
understand them.

1145
01:27:27,606 --> 01:27:30,542
She breezes into my life
for one lousy night...

1146
01:27:30,610 --> 01:27:32,042
...now I'm in a paternity suit.

1147
01:27:32,878 --> 01:27:33,969
You slept with this guy?

1148
01:27:35,014 --> 01:27:36,003
I made her.

1149
01:27:36,081 --> 01:27:39,744
Pal. You want her?
Take her.

1150
01:27:40,419 --> 01:27:42,749
Just a one-night
stand to me, that's all.

1151
01:27:46,191 --> 01:27:47,589
You better...

1152
01:27:50,228 --> 01:27:51,955
You're hurt.
It's all my fault.

1153
01:27:52,028 --> 01:27:53,724
You sure are a jerk.

1154
01:28:02,905 --> 01:28:05,032
Is this your mother's house?

1155
01:28:06,008 --> 01:28:07,771
Is this your mother?

1156
01:28:08,543 --> 01:28:09,805
How's your sciatica?

1157
01:28:09,878 --> 01:28:13,837
Peter! Kathy was just here to
tell Tom that I'm having a baby.

1158
01:28:13,949 --> 01:28:16,315
- Out. - But it's not
Tom's baby. It's Elliott's.

1159
01:28:16,384 --> 01:28:19,216
- Yeah! It is?
- It is?

1160
01:28:19,520 --> 01:28:20,852
Out!

1161
01:28:22,623 --> 01:28:25,058
Kathy, could you
leave us alone?

1162
01:28:27,393 --> 01:28:30,192
Buddy, this is my house.

1163
01:28:32,565 --> 01:28:34,158
This is my wife.

1164
01:28:36,602 --> 01:28:37,694
Yeah.

1165
01:28:43,141 --> 01:28:44,472
You lied to me.

1166
01:28:46,244 --> 01:28:47,370
I know.

1167
01:28:52,750 --> 01:28:54,377
Nothing happened.

1168
01:28:54,952 --> 01:28:56,213
Nothing happened?

1169
01:28:57,722 --> 01:28:59,246
Define "nothing"...

1170
01:28:59,323 --> 01:29:02,621
...because it seems to me
that a lot has happened here.

1171
01:29:03,894 --> 01:29:07,660
I'm trying hard to be objective,
so I want to know all of it.

1172
01:29:07,898 --> 01:29:09,865
Why are you really here?

1173
01:29:14,036 --> 01:29:17,096
Tommy's an old friend of
mine from high school.

1174
01:29:18,007 --> 01:29:19,872
He's an old boyfriend.

1175
01:29:21,709 --> 01:29:22,801
Yeah.

1176
01:29:25,347 --> 01:29:27,142
I missed that feeling.

1177
01:29:27,447 --> 01:29:28,676
Feeling?

1178
01:29:29,450 --> 01:29:31,679
You missed that feeling.

1179
01:29:32,653 --> 01:29:36,452
Yeah, you know,
the rush that you get when you're 16?

1180
01:29:37,558 --> 01:29:40,049
Honey, we aren't 16.

1181
01:29:42,429 --> 01:29:43,623
I know.

1182
01:29:44,797 --> 01:29:45,820
I know.

1183
01:29:47,400 --> 01:29:50,698
It's just that you feel special.

1184
01:29:53,005 --> 01:29:55,131
I just wanted to feel like...

1185
01:29:57,108 --> 01:29:58,598
Like a hot babe.

1186
01:29:59,544 --> 01:30:02,944
That's a problem, because you mean
I don't make you feel that way.

1187
01:30:03,247 --> 01:30:07,809
Peter, no. You're my husband.
You love me and I love you, and...

1188
01:30:08,052 --> 01:30:09,314
What?

1189
01:30:12,488 --> 01:30:13,853
I love you.

1190
01:30:16,726 --> 01:30:18,489
But what?

1191
01:30:22,164 --> 01:30:25,497
It's not about you.
It's not even about him.

1192
01:30:25,567 --> 01:30:28,093
You see, I was making
myself miserable.

1193
01:30:29,504 --> 01:30:34,066
I wasn't even that miserable, really.
I was kind of happy...

1194
01:30:34,743 --> 01:30:36,232
...in a miserable kind of way.

1195
01:30:38,646 --> 01:30:41,638
Is that worse than being miserable
in a happy kind of way?

1196
01:30:43,317 --> 01:30:45,011
No.
It's better.

1197
01:30:45,885 --> 01:30:47,546
Because you kind
of enjoy your misery.

1198
01:30:48,321 --> 01:30:50,185
I'm glad somebody did.

1199
01:30:51,925 --> 01:30:53,552
Peter, I'm sorry.

1200
01:30:54,761 --> 01:30:56,489
What else can I say?

1201
01:30:58,130 --> 01:30:59,392
It's that...

1202
01:31:01,500 --> 01:31:03,990
Misery, I know
something about that.

1203
01:31:05,269 --> 01:31:08,670
<i>Misery takes you down</i>

1204
01:31:11,576 --> 01:31:13,133
<i>Drags you all around</i>

1205
01:31:18,149 --> 01:31:20,048
<i>Takes you all over town</i>

1206
01:31:24,021 --> 01:31:26,318
<i>Till you've lost
what you found"</i>

1207
01:31:34,130 --> 01:31:35,255
You got it to rhyme.

1208
01:31:40,969 --> 01:31:42,300
Come here.

1209
01:31:52,279 --> 01:31:56,339
I want to rock you, mamma,
like your body ain't got no bones.

1210
01:32:04,824 --> 01:32:06,256
Let's blow this place.

1211
01:32:08,795 --> 01:32:11,490
You know,
we got a good thing here.

1212
01:32:11,997 --> 01:32:15,295
- I know we do.
- No. The sitter, at home.

1213
01:32:15,599 --> 01:32:16,588
Yeah?

1214
01:32:19,470 --> 01:32:21,803
It's set for overnight.

1215
01:32:22,074 --> 01:32:24,166
And I got a hotel room.

1216
01:32:24,407 --> 01:32:26,740
You be bad, girl.

1217
01:32:28,479 --> 01:32:30,503
The cards are on the table.

1218
01:32:31,282 --> 01:32:33,715
I don't want you to feel obligated.
Straight answer:

1219
01:32:33,783 --> 01:32:37,116
- Do you want to be together?
- How can she ask me that?

1220
01:32:37,787 --> 01:32:38,776
Things are gonna change.

1221
01:32:38,855 --> 01:32:42,153
You're infatuated with a sophisticated
woman, out there on the edge.

1222
01:32:42,224 --> 01:32:44,886
- You're not out on the edge.
- Yes, I am.

1223
01:32:45,260 --> 01:32:46,454
No, you're not.

1224
01:32:46,695 --> 01:32:49,561
Actually, you can be
kind of a drag at times.

1225
01:32:52,433 --> 01:32:54,492
Then you can't
possibly want me.

1226
01:32:55,069 --> 01:32:56,661
Straight answer?

1227
01:32:58,473 --> 01:32:59,496
Yes.

1228
01:33:06,046 --> 01:33:07,103
Yes.

1229
01:33:11,283 --> 01:33:12,717
Watch the face.

1230
01:33:14,019 --> 01:33:15,610
It doesn't hurt.

1231
01:33:40,878 --> 01:33:44,472
Honey, we're trying to plan
a wedding up here!

1232
01:33:46,015 --> 01:33:47,039
Okay!
