1
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:42,458
<i>Mommy? Do dead people swallow?</i>

2
00:02:51,104 --> 00:02:52,196
Well?

3
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:00,703
<i>Do they?</i>

4
00:03:07,987 --> 00:03:09,011
No.

5
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:12,150
Then what do they do
with the water in their mouth?

6
00:03:12,725 --> 00:03:15,421
They stop getting water in their mouths.

7
00:03:16,296 --> 00:03:17,354
Why?

8
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:21,564
Don't wake Daddy.

9
00:03:21,834 --> 00:03:23,324
Daddy's awake.

10
00:03:24,237 --> 00:03:27,070
lt's Saturday, honey. Go back to sleep.

11
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:30,200
Daddy, they don't let you be a pilot
if you wear glasses!

12
00:03:30,276 --> 00:03:31,265
Hannah!

13
00:03:31,344 --> 00:03:33,107
Ollie, off!

14
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,547
Come on. Off the bed, Ollie. Off!

15
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:41,186
l've been playing handball
with quadratic equations all night.

16
00:03:41,688 --> 00:03:43,178
Yeah? Who won?

17
00:03:43,756 --> 00:03:46,020
l better get this article finished...

18
00:03:46,092 --> 00:03:49,118
...or l am never going to get
a good night's sleep.

19
00:03:49,929 --> 00:03:51,726
l'm working at school today.

20
00:03:51,798 --> 00:03:53,857
No, you've got the kids till 2:00.

21
00:03:53,933 --> 00:03:57,528
l've my museum class, then l drop
off the payroll at Al's doughnut hole.

22
00:03:57,604 --> 00:03:59,538
l want cinnamon... No, sugar!

23
00:03:59,672 --> 00:04:02,800
-White ones!
-No doughnuts for you little porkers.

24
00:04:03,042 --> 00:04:04,475
Oink! Oink!

25
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:07,975
Honey, make my cruller with white icing.

26
00:04:10,283 --> 00:04:11,750
Two minutes.

27
00:04:14,887 --> 00:04:16,479
lt's not fair!

28
00:04:17,523 --> 00:04:18,581
ls this fair?

29
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:20,157
-Yes!
-Yes!

30
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:23,954
-What do you want for breakfast?
-l'm dead.

31
00:04:24,964 --> 00:04:26,625
That's easy.

32
00:04:27,533 --> 00:04:32,527
Look carefully at the way Rubens
uses pinks and whites in his women.

33
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:35,999
They have the alabaster cast of a statue...

34
00:04:36,075 --> 00:04:38,543
...with just enough rosy shades...

35
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:41,273
...to make them eminently approachable.

36
00:04:41,748 --> 00:04:43,909
All l know is, they make me feel thin.

37
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:46,984
And of course, the famous red hair.

38
00:04:47,654 --> 00:04:52,648
Most art historians believe
this was the color of his mistress' hair.

39
00:04:55,028 --> 00:04:58,020
Emily, are we listing lovers
or acquaintances?

40
00:04:58,765 --> 00:05:00,130
You're done?

41
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,994
l've been married for 10 years.
What do you want from me?

42
00:05:03,069 --> 00:05:05,902
-Didn't you go to college?
-Yeah, but....

43
00:05:12,078 --> 00:05:14,774
''One-night stand, handsome, great in bed.''

44
00:05:14,947 --> 00:05:16,209
And you regretted it?

45
00:05:16,749 --> 00:05:20,048
Him. He asked me
to bring a friend next time.

46
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,444
And you can't remember his name?

47
00:05:22,522 --> 00:05:26,822
Listen, when you've had over....
the names get a little fuzzy.

48
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:28,888
God!

49
00:05:29,796 --> 00:05:32,822
''Jean-Claude.''
ls this the guy in Saint Martin?

50
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:36,098
Yeah. You spent the weekend
in the Caribbean...

51
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:38,535
...and didn't l go to Marineland?

52
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:43,375
You came home with a plastic shark.
l came home with crabs.

53
00:05:49,382 --> 00:05:51,976
Now, if you ladies will follow me.

54
00:05:53,553 --> 00:05:57,785
This French sculpture
is from the 20th century...

55
00:05:58,124 --> 00:06:01,287
...and by Edmond Louise Colette.

56
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:06,256
This sculpture epitomizes
the art movement...

57
00:06:06,599 --> 00:06:09,363
...from Art Nouveau to Art Deco.

58
00:06:09,569 --> 00:06:11,093
Who was the best, and why?

59
00:06:11,771 --> 00:06:15,263
-There's an emphasis on simple lines....
-Howard.

60
00:06:15,808 --> 00:06:18,299
Because he just adored sex
and couldn't get enough?

61
00:06:18,578 --> 00:06:20,546
Because we were in love.

62
00:06:21,114 --> 00:06:23,776
-l've done that.
-Listen to you.

63
00:06:24,317 --> 00:06:26,717
lt must be hell being in a great marriage.

64
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:31,289
lt is when you've been invited
to your 15th high school reunion...

65
00:06:31,524 --> 00:06:36,120
...and it kicks off wild sexual fantasies
about your first love.

66
00:06:38,164 --> 00:06:41,065
-Old <i>numero uno</i>, Robert?
-No!

67
00:06:41,134 --> 00:06:44,626
Tommy and l never did it.
We did everything but for two years.

68
00:06:44,704 --> 00:06:45,762
What?

69
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:49,768
You're from the coast.
ln Ohio, you don't do it. l was saving it.

70
00:06:49,842 --> 00:06:53,403
-For who? Robert Hornswath?
-Evidently.

71
00:06:53,479 --> 00:06:54,571
So, are you going?

72
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:59,408
l don't know.
l haven't seen him in 15 years.

73
00:06:59,619 --> 00:07:03,817
He lives in Denver now.
He probably wouldn't even be there.

74
00:07:06,492 --> 00:07:08,722
Can you recover from a face-lift
in five months?

75
00:07:08,828 --> 00:07:11,729
Are you going to worry about this
or have fun with it?

76
00:07:12,732 --> 00:07:13,926
You'll have fun.

77
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,163
l know l'm never going to hear
the end of it now.

78
00:07:18,204 --> 00:07:20,798
Emily, what is the matter with me?

79
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:24,838
Every day, l fantasize
about jumping on a plane to Denver...

80
00:07:24,977 --> 00:07:28,003
...finding Tommy, and screwing him silly!

81
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:34,850
Pardon me.

82
00:07:38,057 --> 00:07:40,184
So what do you think of this?

83
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,290
God, that's disgusting, Mom.

84
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:45,290
Peter?

85
00:07:52,905 --> 00:07:55,339
What do you think of this one?

86
00:07:56,042 --> 00:07:57,475
That's more Emily.

87
00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:01,204
You know, bookkeepers can be chic.
Peter?

88
00:08:03,783 --> 00:08:06,115
Yeah, she's not wearing a bra.

89
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:10,215
-Can l see that, please?
-No.

90
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:13,490
Bedtime. That's it.

91
00:08:13,559 --> 00:08:16,494
-Tomorrow's my birthday!
-l know it's your birthday.

92
00:08:16,562 --> 00:08:18,928
Your Daddy and l have
a lot of getting ready to do.

93
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:22,695
-l don't want to go to bed.
-You never want to go to bed.

94
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:23,927
Good night, Daddy!

95
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:25,994
Good night, sweetie. l'll be up in a minute.

96
00:08:26,072 --> 00:08:28,506
-Brush your teeth.
-Okay.

97
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:39,411
You dropped those.

98
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:48,824
l know that tune.

99
00:09:47,954 --> 00:09:49,546
Can we do it without kissing?

100
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:53,282
Sure. Yeah. Come here.

101
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:58,658
Can we do it without moving?
l'm exhausted.

102
00:09:59,699 --> 00:10:02,600
Good. Me, too. l thought you wanted to.

103
00:10:03,736 --> 00:10:05,260
Not me. How about you?

104
00:10:08,374 --> 00:10:10,638
-We can do it tomorrow.
-Yeah.

105
00:10:12,411 --> 00:10:13,503
Nope.

106
00:10:14,547 --> 00:10:16,777
After Gina's party, l doubt it.

107
00:10:17,149 --> 00:10:18,343
Monday.

108
00:10:19,051 --> 00:10:21,349
Department meeting. Goes late.

109
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:22,751
Tuesday.

110
00:10:23,823 --> 00:10:26,018
Yeah, let's shoot for Tuesday.

111
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:44,132
That was nice.

112
00:10:45,077 --> 00:10:46,601
lt's always nice.

113
00:11:29,055 --> 00:11:30,545
Lipstick. Yeah.

114
00:11:50,576 --> 00:11:52,339
Where are you going?

115
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:55,578
To do my taxes and learn Spanish.

116
00:11:56,148 --> 00:11:59,584
-l need to sleep, Elliott.
-You can sleep here, you know.

117
00:11:59,852 --> 00:12:02,082
No, l can't. You're always drawing me.

118
00:12:02,455 --> 00:12:04,514
You waste a lot of time sleeping.

119
00:12:05,691 --> 00:12:08,626
l like sleeping.
lt makes the years go by faster.

120
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:12,061
That's a lousy attitude
for a woman barely past 30...

121
00:12:12,198 --> 00:12:13,688
...everything ahead of her.

122
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:17,930
35 more years of finding
the perfect piece of culture...

123
00:12:18,037 --> 00:12:22,497
...for over Mrs. Konzulman's sectional,
unmarred by love or family.

124
00:12:23,709 --> 00:12:25,643
Leave me if you must...

125
00:12:25,778 --> 00:12:29,077
...but if you're checking out
that Denver gallery on Friday...

126
00:12:29,148 --> 00:12:31,548
...l'd like to see you tomorrow sometime.

127
00:12:32,218 --> 00:12:33,913
Can't tomorrow.

128
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:36,247
Tomorrow's my goddaughter's
birthday party.

129
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:38,690
l like birthday parties.

130
00:12:39,658 --> 00:12:42,388
No. You're not invited.

131
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:45,457
Are you saying you're ashamed of me?

132
00:12:47,199 --> 00:12:50,430
Everyone there is bringing their children.
l'll be dating one.

133
00:12:51,871 --> 00:12:52,963
Yes.

134
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,434
l'm 26.

135
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:59,238
l don't know why you're pressing this.
You'll just get bored.

136
00:12:59,311 --> 00:13:01,404
With Pin the Tail on the Donkey? No way.

137
00:13:01,814 --> 00:13:05,215
-All right. Come.
-l will. Thank you.

138
00:13:06,485 --> 00:13:08,316
Elliott!

139
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:14,649
l can't believe you used my lipstick.

140
00:13:19,765 --> 00:13:22,290
This is going to cost me $100.

141
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:24,398
$100 for a lipstick?

142
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:29,173
-No, a trip to the cosmetic counter.
-Right.

143
00:13:38,584 --> 00:13:40,381
ls everybody having fun?

144
00:13:42,288 --> 00:13:43,619
He's cute.

145
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:46,822
-Where's my hat?
-Right there!

146
00:13:46,892 --> 00:13:49,725
-Have you seen my hat?
-Right there!

147
00:13:54,033 --> 00:13:57,833
l'm going to get another apple juice.

148
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,840
He's got a special birthday hat for you!

149
00:14:04,043 --> 00:14:05,510
There you go!

150
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:08,878
And he's got something for you!

151
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:13,347
Hannah, when is your birthday?

152
00:14:13,786 --> 00:14:15,276
Three more months.

153
00:14:16,055 --> 00:14:18,649
Three months? l can't wait that long.

154
00:14:19,491 --> 00:14:20,617
Me, too.

155
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:24,591
l cannot wait to give you your present
for three months.

156
00:14:28,767 --> 00:14:32,897
You can write anything you want in there:
your secrets, your dreams...

157
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:35,564
...and only you can read them.

158
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:39,734
lt's wonderful!

159
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:43,537
Mom!

160
00:14:43,682 --> 00:14:46,981
Mr. Lucky's got one for you! There you go!

161
00:14:51,957 --> 00:14:54,323
And Mr. Lucky's got one for you!

162
00:14:56,662 --> 00:14:58,186
There you go!

163
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,895
Who else wants one?

164
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:14,110
-How's it going, Chef?
-Crazy.

165
00:15:15,781 --> 00:15:18,181
lnteresting bunch over there.

166
00:15:19,051 --> 00:15:22,077
Yeah. That's part of a parenting group.

167
00:15:22,688 --> 00:15:25,486
Personally,
l'd rather belong to a satanic cult.

168
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:28,082
Probably be easier on the kids, yes.

169
00:15:28,961 --> 00:15:33,364
-Boy, they really like these suckers raw.
-So how old is....

170
00:15:37,636 --> 00:15:38,660
Hi.

171
00:15:39,538 --> 00:15:40,937
How are you?

172
00:15:51,817 --> 00:15:52,806
Great party.

173
00:15:52,885 --> 00:15:53,909
Thanks, Elliott.

174
00:15:55,187 --> 00:15:58,588
l particularly liked the part
where Mr. Lucky couldn't find his hat.

175
00:15:58,757 --> 00:16:00,691
l never get tired of that.

176
00:16:00,893 --> 00:16:02,724
Can you make purple?

177
00:16:02,995 --> 00:16:04,622
-Purple?
-Milk.

178
00:16:06,265 --> 00:16:09,393
Do you want magenta purple
or fuchsia purple?

179
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:12,494
Emily said you were good.

180
00:16:13,105 --> 00:16:15,437
What else does our friend say?

181
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:19,302
That you're a great dancer.

182
00:16:20,379 --> 00:16:22,108
l'll settle for that.

183
00:16:23,115 --> 00:16:25,345
-So how old is--
-Pin the Tail on the Donkey.

184
00:16:25,417 --> 00:16:28,113
l forgot to put up the donkey.
Can you believe it?

185
00:16:28,187 --> 00:16:31,020
Peter! Didn't l just see him?

186
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:33,615
You know what?
We really have to be going.

187
00:16:33,692 --> 00:16:36,684
-But aren't you going to stay for cake?
-Cake?

188
00:16:36,862 --> 00:16:38,523
l'm sorry. Jeez!

189
00:16:38,597 --> 00:16:40,622
-Thank you.
-You're going?

190
00:16:40,699 --> 00:16:42,633
You don't want any cake?

191
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:46,201
Thank you.

192
00:16:47,906 --> 00:16:50,534
-Purple!
-lf you're going to have a hot fling...

193
00:16:50,609 --> 00:16:54,101
...you might as well have it
with someone who looks like that.

194
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:55,870
Donkey.

195
00:17:00,786 --> 00:17:04,051
You wanted to meet my friends.
l guess they don't hold your attention.

196
00:17:04,123 --> 00:17:07,524
They seem like very nice people.
We don't exactly have a lot in common.

197
00:17:07,593 --> 00:17:10,255
-So what?
-No. You don't.

198
00:17:10,562 --> 00:17:12,928
You make that sound like an accusation.

199
00:17:12,998 --> 00:17:15,796
You wanted to come,
but you just wanted to come and go.

200
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:18,803
l'm not leaving.
This is my goddaughter's birthday party.

201
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:21,965
l'll stay till the last gift is open
and the last kid goes home.

202
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:24,475
All right. You want me to stay, l'll stay.

203
00:17:24,643 --> 00:17:27,635
l never wanted you to come
in the first place.

204
00:17:28,814 --> 00:17:30,076
All right.

205
00:17:30,616 --> 00:17:33,278
l get the picture. You'll get home all right?

206
00:17:33,419 --> 00:17:35,250
-Kathy will take me.
-Okay.

207
00:17:42,995 --> 00:17:46,829
Remember we said we would stop this
when it wasn't fun anymore?

208
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,433
Are we having fun now?

209
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:53,030
No.

210
00:18:10,055 --> 00:18:11,647
Careful, Liana.

211
00:18:16,628 --> 00:18:18,152
l know.

212
00:18:18,897 --> 00:18:20,057
Elliott leave?

213
00:18:20,132 --> 00:18:23,101
Why can't l be attracted to a nice,
solid professional?

214
00:18:23,168 --> 00:18:27,070
-You got any divorced MBAs around?
-l liked him. l thought he was disarming.

215
00:18:27,139 --> 00:18:30,666
-We broke up.
-ln a phony sort of way.

216
00:18:31,543 --> 00:18:33,738
And look what he calls purple.

217
00:18:34,913 --> 00:18:36,904
You can do better than that.

218
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:40,574
-Anyway, his bod wasn't that great.
-Yes, it was.

219
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:43,254
Yes, it was.

220
00:18:56,068 --> 00:18:58,536
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

221
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:00,563
Great party, Mom.

222
00:19:01,507 --> 00:19:03,168
Come to dinner Friday.

223
00:19:03,242 --> 00:19:05,608
l can't. l'm supposed to be
in Denver on Friday.

224
00:19:06,211 --> 00:19:07,405
Denver?

225
00:19:07,546 --> 00:19:10,242
Elliott's got a show there
in a couple months.

226
00:19:10,449 --> 00:19:11,746
Tommy's Denver?

227
00:19:13,085 --> 00:19:17,021
-Emily, you gotta look him up for me.
-And say what?

228
00:19:17,089 --> 00:19:20,650
He's got a sporting goods store
right downtown: Andrews Sporting.

229
00:19:21,059 --> 00:19:23,220
Pretend you're buying a gun.

230
00:19:24,296 --> 00:19:27,857
You haven't seen him since you were 16.
He's probably fat, bald, and ugly.

231
00:19:28,033 --> 00:19:30,729
Great! What better way
to put me out of my suffering?

232
00:19:30,802 --> 00:19:33,293
Think about it. Why spoil a great fantasy?

233
00:19:34,306 --> 00:19:36,866
lt's beginning to make my marriage
look like sludge.

234
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:39,375
-You have a wonderful marriage.
-Exactly.

235
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:43,440
Come on, do me a favor. Just look at him.

236
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:46,274
Maybe.

237
00:19:50,589 --> 00:19:53,854
The last thing are these two there.

238
00:19:54,059 --> 00:19:55,686
Jamison Thomas Gallery?

239
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:02,800
Which one goes on the left?

240
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:15,809
lt's not enough just to look him up.

241
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:18,611
This one. Definitely.
What are you talking about?

242
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:21,277
l have to know what it's like.
You must sleep with him.

243
00:20:26,959 --> 00:20:30,053
l've got a plane to catch in 30 minutes.
Are these the invoices?

244
00:20:30,162 --> 00:20:33,689
Listen to me.
Someone's got to complete the mission.

245
00:20:33,765 --> 00:20:37,360
l can't sleep with Tommy, but you can.
lt's the only way.

246
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:39,867
Don't say another word. l'm your gal.

247
00:20:40,172 --> 00:20:42,800
-You're not taking me seriously.
-Yes, l am.

248
00:20:42,874 --> 00:20:45,934
Go there and not sleep
with your ex-boyfriend? That's stupid.

249
00:20:46,011 --> 00:20:48,878
You don't seem to understand.
This is really getting to me.

250
00:20:51,316 --> 00:20:53,750
l'm just asking you a simple favor.

251
00:20:57,289 --> 00:20:59,154
l'll try to look him up, okay?

252
00:21:00,325 --> 00:21:01,053
Thank you!

253
00:21:02,561 --> 00:21:05,325
And Saturday, come straight
to my house from the airport.

254
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,568
And when you meet him, don't wear this.

255
00:21:10,636 --> 00:21:11,898
l hate this on you.

256
00:21:18,343 --> 00:21:19,833
Three plus three is six.

257
00:21:20,212 --> 00:21:21,975
One plus one is two.

258
00:21:22,381 --> 00:21:26,408
-10 plus 10 is 20.
-Wait, Mom. Give us a few more minutes!

259
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:29,519
lt's 8:00 Saturday night.
You know the rule.

260
00:21:34,593 --> 00:21:37,721
Okay, bed. Come on, Hannah.

261
00:21:39,865 --> 00:21:42,129
There you go. Did you brush your teeth?

262
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,930
All right. Thank you.

263
00:21:46,271 --> 00:21:48,068
How about you? Brush your teeth?

264
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:49,903
-Yeah.
-Good girl.

265
00:21:50,175 --> 00:21:51,540
Good night, sweetheart.

266
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:54,545
-Good night, Mommy.
-Good night, Mommy.

267
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:56,145
Come on, Ollie.

268
00:21:57,215 --> 00:21:58,204
Good night, Ollie.

269
00:21:59,351 --> 00:22:00,978
Did l mention that l love you?

270
00:22:01,119 --> 00:22:03,519
-l love you, too, Mom.
-l love you.

271
00:22:03,655 --> 00:22:05,020
Good night.

272
00:22:14,433 --> 00:22:16,526
The attractor splits in two.

273
00:22:19,705 --> 00:22:21,798
Magnetic fields drift.

274
00:22:26,411 --> 00:22:28,345
lmpulse becomes erratic.

275
00:22:31,316 --> 00:22:33,716
''She walked in the room

276
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,545
''So she could rub his neck

277
00:22:44,329 --> 00:22:46,627
''Then she gave him a little kiss

278
00:22:49,568 --> 00:22:51,331
''Something like this

279
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:57,606
''Then on Monday,
she calls him on the phone

280
00:22:57,676 --> 00:22:59,644
''Says she'll bring the kids home''

281
00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:03,579
From ballet lessons so that l can
stay at school and correct papers?

282
00:23:04,416 --> 00:23:05,781
Fat chance.

283
00:23:09,821 --> 00:23:13,587
-l'm so glad l'm married to you.
-What brought that on?

284
00:23:14,359 --> 00:23:17,487
Your music. lt's beautiful.

285
00:23:19,097 --> 00:23:20,962
-Really?
-Yeah.

286
00:23:21,466 --> 00:23:24,401
-You lie like a rug.
-l don't lie!

287
00:23:26,304 --> 00:23:28,898
-l'll get it.
-No. That's Emily.

288
00:23:33,311 --> 00:23:34,335
So?

289
00:23:35,113 --> 00:23:36,705
lt was a good trip.

290
00:23:37,115 --> 00:23:39,242
Did you see anybody l know?

291
00:23:46,158 --> 00:23:47,386
Hey, Em.

292
00:23:52,497 --> 00:23:55,295
-Spill it.
-You sure you want to hear this?

293
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,992
He's a fat slob.

294
00:23:58,003 --> 00:24:00,471
Emily, what is the point
if you don't tell me?

295
00:24:00,539 --> 00:24:03,804
ls he married with five kids?
ls he a bum? ls he dead?

296
00:24:03,909 --> 00:24:06,343
What? See?
Look, l'm just making myself crazy.

297
00:24:06,411 --> 00:24:08,276
-You sure?
-Tell me!

298
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:12,045
You did me the favor.

299
00:24:13,118 --> 00:24:16,485
-What are you talking about?
-l'm talking about Tom.

300
00:24:17,489 --> 00:24:21,892
The big, strong hunk
in the red flannel shirt...

301
00:24:22,727 --> 00:24:26,322
...with a tongue like velvet
and the arms you could die in.

302
00:24:28,767 --> 00:24:29,859
You met him?

303
00:24:30,769 --> 00:24:33,499
No wonder you always
fantasize about him.

304
00:24:34,172 --> 00:24:36,732
This one's a man!

305
00:24:37,742 --> 00:24:41,735
Capital M-A-N, man.

306
00:24:53,358 --> 00:24:58,352
lf there were a nuclear war,
Tom's the one l'd want in my bomb shelter.

307
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:00,520
He sure grew up.

308
00:25:00,866 --> 00:25:05,326
Actually, if there wasn't a nuclear war,
l'd want him in my bomb shelter.

309
00:25:05,537 --> 00:25:07,732
You don't have a bomb shelter.

310
00:25:08,273 --> 00:25:10,173
And get up off the floor.

311
00:25:11,243 --> 00:25:13,768
Kathy, this man made me feel
like a woman.

312
00:25:13,945 --> 00:25:17,278
-What do you mean?
-We talked. We laughed. We danced.

313
00:25:17,616 --> 00:25:21,245
-So the two of you....
-All night.

314
00:25:38,236 --> 00:25:40,727
Honey, we're trying to talk in here!

315
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:42,732
Okay.

316
00:25:56,154 --> 00:25:57,678
Tell me everything.

317
00:25:57,956 --> 00:26:02,484
l could still see him as the plane took off.

318
00:26:07,065 --> 00:26:09,033
l could still smell him.

319
00:26:12,103 --> 00:26:13,798
That's everything.

320
00:26:16,942 --> 00:26:20,901
And to think l almost didn't even call him.

321
00:26:22,614 --> 00:26:23,945
Kathy!

322
00:26:24,583 --> 00:26:27,882
The man knew what l wanted before l did.

323
00:26:29,788 --> 00:26:30,777
You seem upset.

324
00:26:32,357 --> 00:26:34,154
No, not at all.

325
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:38,791
No. Couldn't have worked out better.
See? lt's finished.

326
00:26:39,864 --> 00:26:43,197
He's out of my mind,
and l have you to thank for it.

327
00:26:43,468 --> 00:26:46,460
l never have to think of him again, ever!

328
00:26:48,139 --> 00:26:49,766
You're mad at me.

329
00:26:50,675 --> 00:26:52,666
Kathy, l did you a favor.

330
00:26:52,777 --> 00:26:54,768
lt was your idea for me to sleep with him.

331
00:26:55,313 --> 00:26:57,713
Once! Not eight times.

332
00:26:58,249 --> 00:27:00,149
The shower doesn't count. We didn't--

333
00:27:00,952 --> 00:27:03,614
Can't you do it on a bed
like normal people?

334
00:27:03,688 --> 00:27:05,679
l never told you to do it
on a butcher block!

335
00:27:08,326 --> 00:27:12,558
This may come as a surprise to you,
but l did it for me.

336
00:27:13,565 --> 00:27:14,554
Wait!

337
00:27:16,234 --> 00:27:18,031
Did you talk about me at all?

338
00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:23,104
You've got Peter and the kids.
Let me have my one lousy night in Denver.

339
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:26,501
Did he ask for my number?

340
00:27:26,945 --> 00:27:29,277
Yeah, he asked for your number.

341
00:27:37,889 --> 00:27:39,015
Good night, Peter.

342
00:27:40,358 --> 00:27:42,087
Leaving already, Em?

343
00:27:42,994 --> 00:27:44,962
-Want something to eat?
-Nah.

344
00:27:45,263 --> 00:27:46,958
-Sure?
-Yeah.

345
00:27:47,298 --> 00:27:48,492
You're missing out.

346
00:27:49,467 --> 00:27:50,559
See you later.

347
00:27:50,802 --> 00:27:52,201
All right.

348
00:27:53,405 --> 00:27:56,340
l guess it's you and me, buddy.

349
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:15,084
What was that all about with Emily?

350
00:28:15,727 --> 00:28:16,955
Nothing.

351
00:28:18,129 --> 00:28:20,654
A teacher from Princeton started today.

352
00:28:21,433 --> 00:28:22,627
Joe Dubin.

353
00:28:22,934 --> 00:28:26,233
He's a brilliant guy.
They just throw grants at him.

354
00:28:26,571 --> 00:28:28,698
He sticks with basic linear questions like:

355
00:28:28,773 --> 00:28:31,742
''How big is it?'' and
''How long does it last?''

356
00:28:31,810 --> 00:28:33,641
So he gets a lot of equipment.

357
00:28:35,013 --> 00:28:37,106
He gets a lot of attention.

358
00:28:37,282 --> 00:28:41,343
But l don't know, l think he totally ignores
the disorderly behavior...

359
00:28:41,419 --> 00:28:45,287
...of a lot of important phenomena.

360
00:28:46,891 --> 00:28:49,883
Can't deal with it.
Doesn't know what to make of it, right?

361
00:28:51,463 --> 00:28:52,794
My stuff, you know...

362
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:57,597
...this equation that l'm testing
about reversing magnetic fields....

363
00:28:57,669 --> 00:29:00,934
With that stuff,
l gotta deal with disorderly behavior.

364
00:29:01,639 --> 00:29:05,075
Because patterns can be stable...

365
00:29:05,143 --> 00:29:09,341
...but when they're really fascinating
is when they're...

366
00:29:10,148 --> 00:29:11,513
...unstable.

367
00:29:11,916 --> 00:29:13,247
Chaotic.

368
00:29:13,952 --> 00:29:15,681
Wild and abandoned.

369
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:19,447
Olives.

370
00:29:20,425 --> 00:29:21,858
So you look at the patterns.

371
00:29:21,926 --> 00:29:24,690
Logic gets you so far,
then you gotta go on a feeling.

372
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:27,926
You've got to follow your intuition.

373
00:29:27,999 --> 00:29:31,628
l've got a feeling
that there is a point of crisis...

374
00:29:31,936 --> 00:29:34,837
...in stable systems of magnetic fields...

375
00:29:36,141 --> 00:29:40,305
...where small changes get magnified,
and then all of a sudden...

376
00:29:40,478 --> 00:29:42,412
...everything goes amok.

377
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:47,217
l don't know. lt's just a feeling.

378
00:29:50,522 --> 00:29:54,583
That's why l say fractal geometry
is a lot like the blues.

379
00:29:54,726 --> 00:29:58,162
The passion, the power, the mystery....
l don't know.

380
00:29:58,797 --> 00:30:01,595
Sometimes you have to look at things
in the periphery...

381
00:30:01,699 --> 00:30:06,693
...because if you look right at it,
you don't see what's there.

382
00:30:16,181 --> 00:30:17,375
l'm sorry.

383
00:30:19,384 --> 00:30:21,011
Are you hungry?

384
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:24,354
l'm going to make you one of these.

385
00:30:32,597 --> 00:30:34,724
-Honey.
-What?

386
00:30:35,233 --> 00:30:37,326
Give somebody else a chance.

387
00:30:44,409 --> 00:30:47,037
-Beautiful sermon.
-Thank you.

388
00:30:47,345 --> 00:30:49,438
Beautiful sermon.

389
00:30:54,252 --> 00:30:56,550
Hannah, here!

390
00:31:18,009 --> 00:31:19,840
lt's always a tragedy...

391
00:31:21,212 --> 00:31:24,579
...to see a young man cut down
in the bloom of his life.

392
00:31:26,317 --> 00:31:29,286
He was a good father
and a wonderful husband...

393
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:31,689
...although sometimes inattentive.

394
00:31:32,724 --> 00:31:35,318
He always performed satisfactorily...

395
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:39,052
...but not with the enthusiasm
of the early years.

396
00:31:40,164 --> 00:31:44,191
Nonetheless, it was a cruel,
shocking blow to those he left behind.

397
00:31:46,571 --> 00:31:49,836
We ask God to comfort and restore Kathy...

398
00:31:50,775 --> 00:31:52,970
...easing her through
the next few months...

399
00:31:53,678 --> 00:31:57,341
...which l know will be a trying
and lonely time for her.

400
00:32:27,879 --> 00:32:29,039
Mommy?

401
00:32:29,847 --> 00:32:31,610
Mommy?

402
00:32:34,819 --> 00:32:37,652
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

403
00:32:37,989 --> 00:32:39,149
Careful.

404
00:32:44,262 --> 00:32:46,059
We're okay.

405
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:48,462
l'm having a hard time with this.

406
00:32:48,733 --> 00:32:51,566
-You forgot me!
-Thank you!

407
00:32:52,003 --> 00:32:53,197
Ready?

408
00:32:53,671 --> 00:32:55,298
Boy, that sermon....

409
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:58,765
-You seemed to be listening to every word.
-Did l?

410
00:33:04,315 --> 00:33:07,307
l would say....
Not just me, of course, others would say...

411
00:33:07,385 --> 00:33:09,717
...when l was at Princeton.... <i>Grazie</i>.

412
00:33:11,089 --> 00:33:15,048
When l left Princeton, and not just because
l was chairman of the department...

413
00:33:15,126 --> 00:33:17,924
...l think it was the finest math
department in the country.

414
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:19,224
lt was?

415
00:33:20,098 --> 00:33:21,395
The finest? Because....

416
00:33:22,233 --> 00:33:23,393
l left.

417
00:33:25,103 --> 00:33:26,627
Never mind why.

418
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:28,772
Okay. l'll tell you. Woman trouble.

419
00:33:30,208 --> 00:33:32,608
Grad, undergrad, what's the difference?

420
00:33:33,211 --> 00:33:35,975
Don't ask me, Joe.
l'm the father of two daughters.

421
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:37,169
There's a headache.

422
00:33:37,315 --> 00:33:40,580
You don't expect them to be virgins
by the time they go to college...

423
00:33:41,652 --> 00:33:42,812
...do you?

424
00:33:44,522 --> 00:33:45,682
Honey.

425
00:33:47,058 --> 00:33:48,116
What?

426
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:51,991
-That's a good answer.
-No. lt's just that they--

427
00:33:52,196 --> 00:33:53,527
-l'll get it.
-No, l'll get it.

428
00:33:53,598 --> 00:33:55,793
No, honey. l got it!

429
00:33:58,169 --> 00:34:00,933
Boy, she sure comes alive
when the phone rings.

430
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:04,002
Might l suggest lithium?

431
00:34:04,242 --> 00:34:05,334
No.

432
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:08,838
For Kathy, aspirin is a psychedelic.

433
00:34:12,316 --> 00:34:14,910
-Hello.
<i>-Hi. This is Tom.</i>

434
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:17,587
That's not funny.

435
00:34:18,489 --> 00:34:19,854
You've lost your sense of humor.

436
00:34:20,691 --> 00:34:22,488
l'll laugh when it's funny.

437
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:25,290
<i>I just wanted to remind you</i>
<i>of Elliott's opening on Friday.</i>

438
00:34:25,563 --> 00:34:29,158
Dennis Hopper will be there.
Put your name on the list?

439
00:34:30,568 --> 00:34:32,331
Okay. l'm not sure we can make it.

440
00:34:33,638 --> 00:34:34,662
Whatever.

441
00:34:36,941 --> 00:34:38,169
Bye.

442
00:34:41,212 --> 00:34:44,409
Anybody been hanging up
when you answer the phone?

443
00:34:45,817 --> 00:34:46,841
Yeah, her mother.

444
00:34:48,853 --> 00:34:50,445
Don't tell Kathy.

445
00:34:52,557 --> 00:34:54,354
-Who was that?
-Emily.

446
00:34:56,461 --> 00:34:59,157
Couldn't you two guys make up?

447
00:34:59,864 --> 00:35:02,697
Historically speaking,
when two women fight...

448
00:35:03,234 --> 00:35:04,531
...it's usually over a man.

449
00:35:05,069 --> 00:35:07,037
-Okay.
-l'm sorry.

450
00:35:07,271 --> 00:35:08,533
Good shot. Two points.

451
00:35:09,841 --> 00:35:12,503
-Excuse me. l'm sorry.
-That's all right.

452
00:35:24,722 --> 00:35:27,623
-Does Emily know Dennis Hopper?
-l don't know.

453
00:35:27,692 --> 00:35:30,252
'Cause we could be talking to him,
you know.

454
00:35:30,328 --> 00:35:34,697
Does the guy talk?
l don't know. He's short, l know that.

455
00:35:34,999 --> 00:35:38,628
-Short? He looks very tall.
-No, he's very short.

456
00:35:38,703 --> 00:35:42,503
Honey, you're so good at this stuff.
You always know what to say.

457
00:35:42,573 --> 00:35:44,097
There's the bar.

458
00:35:44,575 --> 00:35:46,975
-Go.
-l'll start there.

459
00:36:03,928 --> 00:36:06,419
Would you all excuse me? Enjoy the show.

460
00:36:09,233 --> 00:36:10,757
lt's all yours.

461
00:36:13,037 --> 00:36:15,164
l almost hate to part with it.

462
00:36:15,239 --> 00:36:19,175
-You've made a great discovery in Elliott.
-You have a good eye, Mrs. Konzulman.

463
00:36:19,243 --> 00:36:20,676
Can l have a moment with you?

464
00:36:20,745 --> 00:36:23,270
This is Mrs. Konzulman.
She just bought this piece.

465
00:36:23,347 --> 00:36:25,281
Great. l hope you enjoy it.

466
00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:27,817
l will. lt's so pretty.

467
00:36:30,388 --> 00:36:35,382
-Yes. What exactly do you--
-We have some business to attend to.

468
00:36:36,561 --> 00:36:37,619
Enjoy it.

469
00:36:39,397 --> 00:36:43,333
''Pretty''? Did she say ''pretty''?
No, Elliott, she said ''evocative.''

470
00:36:43,501 --> 00:36:47,232
lt is evocative and lyrical.
lt is evocatively lyrical.

471
00:36:47,605 --> 00:36:48,867
Thank you.

472
00:36:49,106 --> 00:36:53,600
And might l add, you're looking
very evocatively lyrical tonight.

473
00:36:56,681 --> 00:36:58,774
So you want to consummate the sale?

474
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:09,984
No.

475
00:37:16,467 --> 00:37:17,832
l miss you.

476
00:37:18,970 --> 00:37:21,530
-l miss this.
-l'm sure you do.

477
00:37:23,574 --> 00:37:24,734
All right, Emily.

478
00:37:25,176 --> 00:37:27,144
l screwed up at Gina's birthday party.

479
00:37:27,578 --> 00:37:31,446
l'm sorry. But that's it? No more fun?

480
00:37:33,784 --> 00:37:35,684
l've had plenty of fun.

481
00:37:37,488 --> 00:37:39,353
l need something more.

482
00:37:40,391 --> 00:37:41,380
Okay.

483
00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:43,082
Okay?

484
00:37:44,362 --> 00:37:47,889
So use me until the right guy comes along.

485
00:37:50,635 --> 00:37:52,193
l think he has.

486
00:38:02,213 --> 00:38:04,204
That's all you had to say.

487
00:38:15,192 --> 00:38:17,592
Say, have you seen Dennis Hopper?

488
00:38:24,935 --> 00:38:28,803
Basically, l added another name to my list,
which l certainly didn't need...

489
00:38:28,873 --> 00:38:31,569
...and l can tell you, it's another regret.

490
00:38:34,679 --> 00:38:37,546
What can l say, Kathy?
We were swept away.

491
00:38:39,083 --> 00:38:41,142
Tommy doesn't get swept away.

492
00:38:41,285 --> 00:38:43,810
We spent two years
not getting swept away.

493
00:38:45,056 --> 00:38:48,685
Of course, l don't strip
as soon as l get into a man's apartment.

494
00:38:48,859 --> 00:38:51,123
No. You only pimp your friends.

495
00:38:52,196 --> 00:38:54,027
You know what l regret about this thing?

496
00:38:54,098 --> 00:38:57,898
l regret that l told you, and l'm not
going to tell you anything anymore.

497
00:38:59,270 --> 00:39:01,033
$11,000?

498
00:39:45,850 --> 00:39:49,752
l'm sorry about you and Emily.
l hope you guys can still be friends.

499
00:39:49,954 --> 00:39:51,581
Yeah, me too.

500
00:39:52,523 --> 00:39:57,358
Although it can be hard being friends if,
say, either of you finds someone else.

501
00:39:57,595 --> 00:39:59,062
You dating anybody new?

502
00:39:59,363 --> 00:40:00,762
No, l'm not.

503
00:40:02,833 --> 00:40:04,300
And Emily....

504
00:40:04,769 --> 00:40:06,236
She is.

505
00:40:06,537 --> 00:40:08,767
But l don't have to tell you that.

506
00:40:09,039 --> 00:40:10,734
The man from Denver?

507
00:40:10,908 --> 00:40:11,897
She met him in Denver?

508
00:40:12,143 --> 00:40:13,508
What has she told you?

509
00:40:13,744 --> 00:40:15,837
Nothing. What has she told you, anything?

510
00:40:16,013 --> 00:40:18,607
-There you are.
-Honey, you remember Elliott?

511
00:40:18,682 --> 00:40:20,582
Yeah. This is great stuff.

512
00:40:20,751 --> 00:40:22,184
Hi, Peter. Thank you.

513
00:40:24,121 --> 00:40:27,488
-lt's a little steep, but it's pretty.
-Pretty?

514
00:40:28,192 --> 00:40:31,628
lt's a little claustrophobic in here for me.
Can we go?

515
00:40:31,762 --> 00:40:32,786
Yeah.

516
00:40:32,863 --> 00:40:36,959
Great. Really, good show.
Elliott, beautiful work.

517
00:40:38,102 --> 00:40:40,093
l never saw Dennis Hopper.

518
00:41:02,658 --> 00:41:04,057
Hello, lover.

519
00:41:04,527 --> 00:41:06,256
l'm so glad l came.

520
00:41:09,665 --> 00:41:12,998
You know, l can't believe
that you and Kathy are friends.

521
00:41:13,502 --> 00:41:18,064
You're so much more beautiful
and sophisticated than she is.

522
00:41:23,479 --> 00:41:27,575
l feel sorry for her.
She's such a pathetic little thing.

523
00:41:27,850 --> 00:41:30,546
Yeah. l can barely remember her.

524
00:41:33,222 --> 00:41:37,852
Her hips have really spread
since she had the children.

525
00:41:43,499 --> 00:41:44,488
Honey, what?

526
00:41:44,901 --> 00:41:46,368
lt's horrible.

527
00:41:47,470 --> 00:41:49,563
Was it a nightmare?

528
00:41:50,006 --> 00:41:51,871
-lt's over.
-No, it's not.

529
00:41:51,941 --> 00:41:54,341
l wish it was, but it's not.

530
00:41:57,413 --> 00:41:58,880
Want some water or something?

531
00:41:58,981 --> 00:42:00,243
-Promise me!
-What?

532
00:42:00,316 --> 00:42:02,978
-l said promise!
-Okay, l promise.

533
00:42:04,153 --> 00:42:06,383
-What?
-Find someone else for Emily.

534
00:42:09,825 --> 00:42:10,917
That's your nightmare?

535
00:42:11,928 --> 00:42:14,123
She's lonely. She doesn't have anybody.

536
00:42:14,196 --> 00:42:15,595
She doesn't need my help.

537
00:42:15,665 --> 00:42:17,462
Men find her very attractive.

538
00:42:17,533 --> 00:42:19,626
-You promised!
-Okay.

539
00:42:19,936 --> 00:42:21,927
Yeah. l'll think about it.

540
00:42:29,445 --> 00:42:30,810
Yeah.

541
00:42:35,351 --> 00:42:36,375
No.

542
00:42:40,389 --> 00:42:44,382
So, blah blah blah, and when asked
about this comparison to Einstein...

543
00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:47,918
...Prof. Dubin said:

544
00:42:47,997 --> 00:42:50,989
''Einstein flunked math. l didn't.''

545
00:42:53,035 --> 00:42:55,003
You can keep that one. l've got copies.

546
00:42:55,071 --> 00:42:58,472
-l can't find my keys.
-Can't wait to get me inside?

547
00:42:58,574 --> 00:43:01,839
Joe, it's late.

548
00:43:01,944 --> 00:43:06,881
Late, yes. But let me ask you this:
You really don't want me to leave, do you?

549
00:43:07,416 --> 00:43:09,714
l have to get up early tomorrow.

550
00:43:10,453 --> 00:43:11,784
lt's 8:50.

551
00:43:12,888 --> 00:43:15,584
Then how about a little good-night fuck?

552
00:43:16,993 --> 00:43:18,153
Good night, fuck.

553
00:43:23,165 --> 00:43:25,793
That's good, Emily, you little minx!

554
00:43:27,803 --> 00:43:29,236
Come on, Emily.

555
00:43:29,672 --> 00:43:33,665
Don't make me beg, okay?
l'm not the type. lt doesn't suit me.

556
00:43:33,743 --> 00:43:36,234
All right. l'll beg. Emily!

557
00:44:17,420 --> 00:44:18,978
Honey, when's dinner?

558
00:44:19,055 --> 00:44:21,819
You want to know when dinner is?
l'll tell you when it is.

559
00:44:21,891 --> 00:44:24,223
lt's when we're good and ready.
That's when it is.

560
00:44:24,493 --> 00:44:26,825
We're having brownie stew tonight,
remember?

561
00:44:26,896 --> 00:44:30,957
Or you just remember how to be waited on
and how to stuff your face?

562
00:44:31,033 --> 00:44:33,399
ls that what you think l do
when l leave the house?

563
00:44:33,469 --> 00:44:35,369
l go someplace and l stuff my face?

564
00:44:35,571 --> 00:44:37,835
l'm sorry l'm taking so long.

565
00:44:37,907 --> 00:44:40,307
Honey, no. You're doing great.

566
00:44:43,612 --> 00:44:44,943
l work hard for the family.

567
00:44:45,714 --> 00:44:49,206
l'm killing myself trying to separate
oscillations on fractal boundaries.

568
00:44:49,285 --> 00:44:50,912
How very meaningful.

569
00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:53,185
''How very meaningful.''

570
00:44:53,656 --> 00:44:56,318
That brings up an interesting question...

571
00:44:56,392 --> 00:44:59,452
...because what is ''meaningful''?

572
00:44:59,962 --> 00:45:02,795
Regard for each other,
that could be meaningful.

573
00:45:03,165 --> 00:45:05,497
Love, friendship...

574
00:45:06,435 --> 00:45:08,027
...tolerance.

575
00:45:08,404 --> 00:45:10,929
Those things, they can be meaningful.

576
00:45:13,742 --> 00:45:18,475
Looking at your husband with compassion
in your eyes instead of resentment...

577
00:45:18,547 --> 00:45:19,809
...that could be meaningful.

578
00:45:20,950 --> 00:45:25,353
You act like l did something wrong
or let you down in some way.

579
00:45:25,421 --> 00:45:26,786
lf l have, you should tell me.

580
00:45:28,457 --> 00:45:30,357
You haven't let me down.

581
00:45:32,061 --> 00:45:33,323
lt has nothing to do with you.

582
00:45:34,864 --> 00:45:36,263
What's it got to do with?

583
00:45:38,501 --> 00:45:40,230
lt's silly. lt's....

584
00:45:41,670 --> 00:45:43,069
Emily and....

585
00:45:44,373 --> 00:45:46,364
That fight is worth all this?

586
00:45:49,378 --> 00:45:51,608
You've been pretty awful lately.

587
00:45:53,282 --> 00:45:55,580
l don't think l deserve it. Does Emily?

588
00:45:57,019 --> 00:45:58,043
No.

589
00:46:16,405 --> 00:46:18,032
Okay, let's see.

590
00:46:18,674 --> 00:46:21,268
12, 13, 14, 15, 16.

591
00:46:26,849 --> 00:46:28,476
lt's over! l've got a handle on it.

592
00:46:28,551 --> 00:46:30,917
l've got a wonderful life.
l'm keeping it that way.

593
00:46:30,986 --> 00:46:32,613
Tom Andrews is not a part of it.

594
00:46:32,688 --> 00:46:35,987
He's a part of your life now,
and l can accept that.

595
00:46:38,294 --> 00:46:39,591
Want to come in?

596
00:46:41,330 --> 00:46:43,696
lf the two of you
can find happiness together...

597
00:46:43,766 --> 00:46:45,927
...l'm certainly not going
to stand in your way.

598
00:46:46,035 --> 00:46:48,060
What are you talking about?

599
00:46:48,404 --> 00:46:51,168
-You and Tom.
-There is no ''me and Tom.''

600
00:46:51,740 --> 00:46:56,177
-But you told Elliott there was a new guy.
-l told him that to get rid of him.

601
00:46:56,378 --> 00:46:58,005
No ''you and Tom''?

602
00:46:58,380 --> 00:47:00,041
lt was one night.

603
00:47:00,249 --> 00:47:04,015
You had the relationship with him.
l had one night.

604
00:47:08,457 --> 00:47:11,358
l wish it could have worked out
for the two of you.

605
00:47:12,928 --> 00:47:14,725
Kathy, you're so full of shit.

606
00:47:16,699 --> 00:47:20,465
l don't want to talk about me and Tom,
nor about you and Tom.

607
00:47:20,536 --> 00:47:23,767
Never mind that pompous asshole
your husband fixed me up with.

608
00:47:23,839 --> 00:47:26,569
lf that's what you came here to discuss,
try the mirror.

609
00:47:26,642 --> 00:47:28,735
There's one in the bathroom.

610
00:47:30,879 --> 00:47:33,370
l've really been selfish, haven't l?

611
00:47:36,452 --> 00:47:37,680
l'm sorry.

612
00:47:38,220 --> 00:47:40,211
And l'm pregnant, l think.

613
00:47:41,890 --> 00:47:42,879
Tom?

614
00:47:43,659 --> 00:47:45,684
Elliott.

615
00:47:47,630 --> 00:47:51,532
-How late are you?
-About five years. Shall we?

616
00:47:58,741 --> 00:48:00,868
What is it we're looking for?

617
00:48:02,444 --> 00:48:05,743
lf it's positive, a doughnut forms.

618
00:48:09,385 --> 00:48:10,579
A doughnut?

619
00:48:11,120 --> 00:48:13,315
What do you mean, like a ring?

620
00:48:14,556 --> 00:48:18,219
Yeah, but they call it a doughnut.

621
00:48:21,864 --> 00:48:24,298
Why don't they just call it a ring?

622
00:48:27,603 --> 00:48:31,664
l guess it's a potentially
sensitive subject for some of us.

623
00:48:44,186 --> 00:48:48,987
l know you haven't taken Elliott seriously,
but this might be a good time to start.

624
00:48:49,224 --> 00:48:50,589
Please.

625
00:48:52,695 --> 00:48:55,027
-A doughnut is forming.
-What?

626
00:48:55,864 --> 00:48:57,331
A doughnut...

627
00:48:59,268 --> 00:49:00,292
...is forming.

628
00:49:01,704 --> 00:49:03,296
Emily.

629
00:49:03,672 --> 00:49:05,299
l think l'm going to be sick.

630
00:49:05,441 --> 00:49:08,899
Okay. Prenatal vitamins and Valium.

631
00:49:10,045 --> 00:49:11,307
Pregnant?

632
00:49:12,314 --> 00:49:13,303
Yes.

633
00:49:13,816 --> 00:49:15,647
You shouldn't take tranquilizers.

634
00:49:16,385 --> 00:49:17,682
l won't be taking both.

635
00:49:20,189 --> 00:49:22,419
''Two hours before procedure.''

636
00:49:23,292 --> 00:49:24,816
Tough decision.

637
00:49:25,527 --> 00:49:26,892
Thank you.

638
00:49:27,029 --> 00:49:28,018
Excuse me.

639
00:49:28,097 --> 00:49:29,189
Good luck!

640
00:49:40,709 --> 00:49:42,108
You baby!

641
00:50:26,755 --> 00:50:27,813
Well?

642
00:50:28,290 --> 00:50:29,882
Decision is made.

643
00:50:35,431 --> 00:50:38,798
-Don't start.
-l can't help it.

644
00:50:44,072 --> 00:50:46,063
-When are you gonna tell Elliott?
-Never.

645
00:50:47,209 --> 00:50:49,700
lf l'm not sure l'm ready,
you can bet he isn't.

646
00:50:49,778 --> 00:50:51,837
That's not fair. You gotta ask him.

647
00:50:51,914 --> 00:50:55,611
-lf not, it will be a long pregnancy for me.
-Lighten up.

648
00:50:56,718 --> 00:50:58,549
Fasten your seat belts. Get ready....

649
00:50:58,620 --> 00:51:00,383
-What are you doing?
-Why not?

650
00:51:00,456 --> 00:51:02,481
-No!
-l'm light. All right?

651
00:51:02,558 --> 00:51:05,186
-This is nuts.
-You still gotta tell Elliott.

652
00:51:06,028 --> 00:51:08,121
l can't help it if l get too involved.

653
00:51:08,197 --> 00:51:10,062
-What are you doing?
-Let's get going.

654
00:51:10,132 --> 00:51:12,726
lt'll take 20 minutes
for that Valium to kick in.

655
00:51:12,801 --> 00:51:15,429
-Don't tell Peter.
-''Don't tell Peter.''

656
00:51:23,345 --> 00:51:25,905
She's going to tell him.
She's got to tell him.

657
00:51:27,216 --> 00:51:30,879
She can't not tell him he's the father,
for heaven's sakes.

658
00:51:31,487 --> 00:51:33,114
He's got to know.

659
00:51:33,722 --> 00:51:35,656
lt's his baby, too.

660
00:51:36,024 --> 00:51:38,117
Fathers are very important.

661
00:51:41,897 --> 00:51:44,092
Yeah, Elliott's got to know.

662
00:51:47,269 --> 00:51:48,600
Nice pill.

663
00:51:56,979 --> 00:52:00,142
Hello. You got them.

664
00:52:02,651 --> 00:52:04,516
Yeah. ls everything okay?

665
00:52:06,588 --> 00:52:07,953
She didn't?

666
00:52:11,660 --> 00:52:13,594
Fifteen minutes. l'll be there.

667
00:52:14,763 --> 00:52:16,594
lt's Kathy's car pool day.

668
00:52:16,899 --> 00:52:18,833
She forgot to pick up the kids.

669
00:52:18,901 --> 00:52:21,563
-She's not home.
-Historically speaking, when a wife--

670
00:52:21,637 --> 00:52:23,867
-Joe, save it.
-All right, sir.

671
00:52:42,424 --> 00:52:44,324
Why, who could that be?

672
00:53:07,382 --> 00:53:11,079
Emily, aren't you a sight for sore eyes?

673
00:53:11,353 --> 00:53:14,914
You were right, Kath.
lt's hell out there without a man.

674
00:53:15,023 --> 00:53:18,254
There, there.
Things have a way of working out.

675
00:53:19,561 --> 00:53:22,530
Honey, do we have enough for company?

676
00:53:24,099 --> 00:53:25,293
Hi, Em!

677
00:53:27,102 --> 00:53:28,091
Staying for dinner?

678
00:53:28,403 --> 00:53:31,065
We were just discussing her problem.

679
00:53:31,907 --> 00:53:34,398
-Have you told Elliott?
-l can't.

680
00:53:34,977 --> 00:53:36,137
He couldn't handle it.

681
00:53:38,213 --> 00:53:40,704
But he's the father. He should know.

682
00:53:41,083 --> 00:53:42,948
Elliott's got to know.

683
00:53:45,287 --> 00:53:46,720
Elliott's got to know.

684
00:53:47,689 --> 00:53:48,815
Kathy.

685
00:53:49,024 --> 00:53:51,652
-Elliott's got to know.
-What?

686
00:53:52,060 --> 00:53:53,049
Are you all right?

687
00:53:53,128 --> 00:53:56,655
Peter! What time is it?
Where are the kids?

688
00:53:56,732 --> 00:53:57,721
l got the kids.

689
00:53:57,799 --> 00:54:02,259
lt's Tuesday. l got the kids,
because you wanted to sleep on the dryer.

690
00:54:02,337 --> 00:54:04,703
l'm sorry. l took a Valium.

691
00:54:04,973 --> 00:54:05,997
What?

692
00:54:06,942 --> 00:54:08,466
You took Valium?

693
00:54:09,678 --> 00:54:10,702
lce cream!

694
00:54:12,381 --> 00:54:13,871
What does Elliott have to know?

695
00:54:15,917 --> 00:54:18,545
l can't tell you.
l promised Emily l wouldn't.

696
00:54:21,990 --> 00:54:23,116
Are we all right?

697
00:54:24,092 --> 00:54:26,822
Yes!

698
00:54:30,265 --> 00:54:33,098
Boy, ''yes'' isn't going
to cut it much longer.

699
00:54:35,003 --> 00:54:38,871
<i>At first it seemed as though</i>
<i>the tangential relationship...</i>

700
00:54:38,940 --> 00:54:41,272
<i>...between the spheres of the y-axis...</i>

701
00:54:41,677 --> 00:54:45,943
<i>...were going to overlap,</i>
<i>and I will be going into that very shortly.</i>

702
00:54:51,153 --> 00:54:54,054
-l know what you're thinking.
-No, you don't.

703
00:54:54,289 --> 00:54:56,257
''Elliott's got to know.''

704
00:54:57,059 --> 00:54:59,084
l'm glad l confided in you.

705
00:54:59,227 --> 00:55:00,694
Jeez. Listen.

706
00:55:03,498 --> 00:55:04,556
lt was a dream.

707
00:55:04,733 --> 00:55:06,462
Dreams don't mean anything.

708
00:55:06,768 --> 00:55:08,099
Really? Okay.

709
00:55:08,303 --> 00:55:10,533
Here's a little physics for you, okay?

710
00:55:10,605 --> 00:55:13,631
Remember Newton? Curly hair, chubby.

711
00:55:14,176 --> 00:55:17,407
''A body at rest stays at rest.
A body in motion stays in motion...

712
00:55:17,479 --> 00:55:19,413
''...unless acted upon by an outside force.''

713
00:55:20,215 --> 00:55:24,015
l think we both agree,
Kathy is a body in motion.

714
00:55:25,821 --> 00:55:27,686
What are you talking about?

715
00:55:28,290 --> 00:55:29,382
Here.

716
00:55:31,293 --> 00:55:32,317
So?

717
00:55:32,728 --> 00:55:35,162
So ''x'' equals Kathy.

718
00:55:46,541 --> 00:55:47,906
This isn't Russian lit.

719
00:55:54,349 --> 00:55:56,340
First of all, if she's not home...

720
00:55:56,418 --> 00:55:58,545
...check if her diaphragm's missing.

721
00:55:58,620 --> 00:56:01,589
l can't believe we're doing this.
l'll sneak into my house...

722
00:56:01,656 --> 00:56:05,183
...creep down the hallway
and catch my wife folding my socks.

723
00:56:05,260 --> 00:56:07,387
Don't forget to check
behind the shower curtain.

724
00:56:07,462 --> 00:56:09,794
That isn't where she folds socks.

725
00:56:14,936 --> 00:56:16,426
All right. Quiet.

726
00:56:16,972 --> 00:56:18,837
She didn't say anything about going out.

727
00:56:18,907 --> 00:56:20,135
They never do.

728
00:56:25,514 --> 00:56:27,982
l think you were right. She was alone.

729
00:56:28,183 --> 00:56:31,084
A woman won't go during the day
on a cheap tryst in a motel...

730
00:56:31,153 --> 00:56:35,089
...because you're at work
and the kids are at school. You're fine.

731
00:56:49,237 --> 00:56:51,137
-What's that? What did you say?
-Nothing.

732
00:56:51,206 --> 00:56:52,537
l thought you said something.

733
00:56:52,607 --> 00:56:55,599
-She's probably going to Safeway.
-She probably is.

734
00:56:59,748 --> 00:57:00,737
lsn't that Safeway?

735
00:57:03,752 --> 00:57:05,413
Bye-bye, Safeway.

736
00:57:06,121 --> 00:57:08,612
She's going to another store.
Lighten up. l'm sure.

737
00:57:08,690 --> 00:57:10,590
You think all she does is shopping.

738
00:57:10,659 --> 00:57:13,890
-l make it sound like nothing.
-There's more to her life than that.

739
00:57:13,962 --> 00:57:15,293
l'm certain there is.

740
00:57:15,363 --> 00:57:19,231
Her life's not so empty that
she has to have a cheap affair with a kid...

741
00:57:19,301 --> 00:57:22,668
...just because he's young
and sensitive with blue eyes.

742
00:57:23,705 --> 00:57:24,729
You're losing her.

743
00:57:24,806 --> 00:57:26,205
l got her.

744
00:57:39,855 --> 00:57:44,292
Unless her aerobics class meets
down here, we're onto something.

745
00:57:50,565 --> 00:57:51,554
Bingo.

746
00:58:04,746 --> 00:58:05,906
Look at the name!

747
00:58:08,583 --> 00:58:09,777
Go!

748
00:58:28,270 --> 00:58:30,704
Looks like what we have here
is a first time.

749
00:58:30,772 --> 00:58:33,263
l know Kathy. She's not going to go in.

750
00:58:39,114 --> 00:58:41,344
Cheer up. He might be a bad lay.

751
00:58:46,588 --> 00:58:49,716
-l've never been in an artist's studio before.
-No?

752
00:58:52,127 --> 00:58:53,754
Well, this is it.

753
00:58:55,096 --> 00:58:58,896
-Just go ahead. Do whatever you're--
-Yeah, sure.

754
00:59:07,742 --> 00:59:09,710
l could do this one of two ways:

755
00:59:09,778 --> 00:59:14,715
l could feel you out, test the waters...

756
00:59:14,783 --> 00:59:18,116
...see how you might react
to marrying Emily...

757
00:59:18,553 --> 00:59:20,418
...and raising a family...

758
00:59:23,959 --> 00:59:28,055
...or skip all that and just blurt out that
Emily's pregnant and having your baby.

759
00:59:30,031 --> 00:59:33,592
Or l could just mind my own business
and not say a word.

760
00:59:34,669 --> 00:59:36,296
-Wait!
-Bye, Elliott!

761
00:59:36,371 --> 00:59:37,360
Bye.

762
00:59:42,844 --> 00:59:45,677
Nothing happened.
lt was only a couple minutes.

763
00:59:45,880 --> 00:59:48,872
Unless, of course, he's a really bad lay.

764
00:59:52,587 --> 00:59:53,884
See?

765
00:59:53,955 --> 00:59:57,322
Come on! You hungry?

766
01:00:25,954 --> 01:00:27,353
Kathy? Hi, it's Elliott.

767
01:00:27,489 --> 01:00:28,786
Hi, Elliott.

768
01:00:30,458 --> 01:00:33,120
<i>I gotta come over</i>
<i>and talk to you about the situation.</i>

769
01:00:33,695 --> 01:00:36,664
This isn't really a good time for me to talk.

770
01:00:37,799 --> 01:00:38,925
<i>No, don't leave me hanging.</i>

771
01:00:39,167 --> 01:00:40,327
l'm dying here.

772
01:00:41,036 --> 01:00:42,503
How about tomorrow?

773
01:00:46,107 --> 01:00:47,597
<i>Fine.</i>

774
01:00:47,675 --> 01:00:48,767
Craters?

775
01:00:48,843 --> 01:00:51,311
<i>-You know where that is?</i>
-Yeah.

776
01:00:52,113 --> 01:00:54,980
1:00. Great. You'll be there, right?

777
01:00:55,050 --> 01:00:58,042
You won't drop another bomb
and run out on me again?

778
01:01:01,923 --> 01:01:03,857
Relax, l'll be there. Bye.

779
01:01:14,903 --> 01:01:15,927
How's it going?

780
01:01:18,673 --> 01:01:19,901
Well....

781
01:01:21,443 --> 01:01:23,570
Johnson's Mortuary is
in the black this month.

782
01:01:25,513 --> 01:01:26,707
Amazing.

783
01:01:41,429 --> 01:01:45,490
This is making me crazy.
What makes her think she's alone in this?

784
01:01:46,034 --> 01:01:49,470
And she's out there somewhere
right now in this city...

785
01:01:49,537 --> 01:01:52,472
...walking around
with a piece of me inside her.

786
01:01:52,974 --> 01:01:56,671
And l'm so angry,
but l also want to protect her...

787
01:01:56,744 --> 01:01:58,575
...but l don't even know what from.

788
01:01:59,781 --> 01:02:02,079
God.... l'm okay.

789
01:02:02,650 --> 01:02:05,346
l don't know exactly what a father does...

790
01:02:05,887 --> 01:02:07,787
...as if she'd even let me.

791
01:02:07,889 --> 01:02:11,882
She's so damn independent,
but that's what l like!

792
01:02:12,360 --> 01:02:14,555
So should l....

793
01:02:14,996 --> 01:02:16,463
Should l call her?

794
01:02:16,598 --> 01:02:18,225
Should l tell her l know?

795
01:02:20,668 --> 01:02:22,465
Should l be drinking?

796
01:02:24,472 --> 01:02:27,930
-l shouldn't have told you.
-No. She should have told me.

797
01:02:28,476 --> 01:02:31,536
Maybe she didn't want
to put you in this position.

798
01:02:32,847 --> 01:02:35,509
But l am in this position...

799
01:02:36,518 --> 01:02:37,678
...and...

800
01:02:40,121 --> 01:02:42,453
...l don't know what to do about it.

801
01:02:44,559 --> 01:02:47,289
Before you confront Emily about the baby...

802
01:02:48,163 --> 01:02:50,825
...you've got to find out
what's there between you...

803
01:02:50,899 --> 01:02:52,230
...without the baby.

804
01:02:54,669 --> 01:02:56,864
-She's busy, Elliott!
-l know.

805
01:02:58,907 --> 01:03:01,000
Carol, that will be all. Thank you.

806
01:03:01,576 --> 01:03:02,804
l'd like to talk about us.

807
01:03:05,079 --> 01:03:07,138
l want to talk about you.

808
01:03:14,789 --> 01:03:16,256
We had a good thing going.

809
01:03:16,324 --> 01:03:19,725
No ties, no talk of the future
from either of us...

810
01:03:19,794 --> 01:03:21,785
...and it was nice.

811
01:03:21,863 --> 01:03:24,730
lt felt good.

812
01:03:27,101 --> 01:03:29,626
We liked each other.
Now suddenly, l'm out on my ass...

813
01:03:29,704 --> 01:03:32,229
...because you decide
it should be something else.

814
01:03:32,307 --> 01:03:36,209
Fine, but on top of that,
you decide l can't handle ''something else.''

815
01:03:36,277 --> 01:03:38,802
So at this point,
you're trying to tell me my limits.

816
01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:42,281
l'll tell you something, lady.
The only limits we've proven are yours.

817
01:03:42,350 --> 01:03:45,808
-Elliott, when you reach my age--
-That's crap! Sit down!

818
01:03:47,222 --> 01:03:49,554
You're not 95.
Age has nothing to do with it.

819
01:03:52,493 --> 01:03:55,894
lf l was auditioning for something,
you should have told me.

820
01:03:55,964 --> 01:03:58,455
You should've given me that chance.

821
01:04:03,338 --> 01:04:04,703
That's all.

822
01:04:05,173 --> 01:04:06,231
l....

823
01:04:08,910 --> 01:04:10,571
Are you saying you want an audition?

824
01:04:17,318 --> 01:04:19,013
You'd have to audition, too, you know.

825
01:04:21,823 --> 01:04:23,290
That seems fair.

826
01:04:40,541 --> 01:04:43,066
What a perfectly glorious day!

827
01:04:44,612 --> 01:04:49,345
Hello. l'd like to welcome all of you
to the Odd Couples Lamaze class.

828
01:04:49,851 --> 01:04:52,046
l like to meet mothers
in their second month...

829
01:04:52,120 --> 01:04:55,214
...so we can talk about nutrition
and prenatal care.

830
01:04:56,024 --> 01:04:58,925
Then you can all go off
and grow those babies...

831
01:04:59,060 --> 01:05:01,051
...and come back to me
in your seventh month.

832
01:05:01,129 --> 01:05:03,597
Then we can get down to the fun stuff:

833
01:05:06,968 --> 01:05:09,994
My name is Maggie Sand. l'm a Capricorn.

834
01:05:10,071 --> 01:05:13,336
l have four children,
ranging in age from 23 down to 2.

835
01:05:14,309 --> 01:05:17,710
Each has a different father,
and l've never been married.

836
01:05:19,180 --> 01:05:21,614
Don't laugh. That's me in 10 years.

837
01:05:21,716 --> 01:05:26,050
Let's all take turns and tell
something about ourselves...

838
01:05:26,521 --> 01:05:29,319
...and share the circumstances
which have brought us here.

839
01:05:30,758 --> 01:05:32,783
How about you young people?

840
01:05:32,994 --> 01:05:35,986
Hi. My name is Jill Topial...

841
01:05:36,064 --> 01:05:38,726
...and this is my brother, Alex.

842
01:05:39,367 --> 01:05:41,028
He's going to be my coach.

843
01:05:41,936 --> 01:05:45,565
l like parties on the beach,
New Kids on the Block...

844
01:05:45,640 --> 01:05:48,541
...and my favorite color is lemon yellow.

845
01:05:49,277 --> 01:05:52,610
lt's my science project,
and if she's late with it...

846
01:05:52,680 --> 01:05:54,511
...l'm in deep shit.

847
01:05:56,984 --> 01:06:00,044
You be sure to get back to us
about that grade.

848
01:06:02,990 --> 01:06:06,482
Quite simply, l am carrying the gift of life.

849
01:06:07,095 --> 01:06:11,293
Mr. and Mrs. Moyer were unable to have
a child of their own...

850
01:06:11,366 --> 01:06:14,267
...and so Mr. Moyer's seed
has been deposited within me.

851
01:06:15,203 --> 01:06:16,431
Mr. and Mrs. Moyer...

852
01:06:16,504 --> 01:06:19,803
...you must be experiencing
the most interesting feelings.

853
01:06:19,874 --> 01:06:22,399
Would you care to share them with us?

854
01:06:22,643 --> 01:06:23,871
-Well--
-No.

855
01:06:33,221 --> 01:06:34,483
You go ahead.

856
01:06:34,689 --> 01:06:37,021
Hi. l'm Debbie Rollins...

857
01:06:37,091 --> 01:06:39,582
...and this is my wife Linda.

858
01:06:40,995 --> 01:06:43,691
We just celebrated
our seventh anniversary...

859
01:06:43,998 --> 01:06:46,125
...and Debbie got a big promotion.

860
01:06:46,200 --> 01:06:49,636
We felt that having a baby
was the next natural step.

861
01:06:50,938 --> 01:06:54,169
l have such a good feeling about you two.

862
01:06:57,378 --> 01:07:01,041
-And our last couple.
-We're just good friends.

863
01:07:05,019 --> 01:07:08,386
My name is Emily.
This is my best friend, Kathy, and....

864
01:07:09,323 --> 01:07:12,520
l found myself pregnant,
and l've always wanted a child, so....

865
01:07:12,627 --> 01:07:15,027
Well, l'm getting one.

866
01:07:21,135 --> 01:07:23,262
l was born on the cusp.

867
01:07:28,009 --> 01:07:29,169
Okay.

868
01:07:29,477 --> 01:07:33,675
Now, l want you all to write down
everything you've eaten today.

869
01:07:35,850 --> 01:07:39,115
Good nutrition begins
with what l like to call...

870
01:07:39,420 --> 01:07:40,717
...good food lQ.

871
01:07:41,389 --> 01:07:43,152
Does spelling count?

872
01:07:45,026 --> 01:07:47,756
You don't belong here, Em.
You're not an odd couple.

873
01:07:47,829 --> 01:07:51,196
-Elliott should be with you.
-l'm thinking about it.

874
01:07:51,399 --> 01:07:54,163
You are? Did the two of you talk?

875
01:07:54,235 --> 01:07:57,534
He did.
l thought he had a lot of good points.

876
01:07:57,605 --> 01:08:00,267
Good. l'm so glad he came through.

877
01:08:02,944 --> 01:08:04,036
What?

878
01:08:04,278 --> 01:08:05,370
You told him.

879
01:08:07,482 --> 01:08:11,145
Emily, you're going to need help.
Parenting is a two-person job.

880
01:08:11,219 --> 01:08:12,982
-l know. l'm a mother.
-So am l!

881
01:08:13,054 --> 01:08:16,421
-No, you're not. Not yet.
-Kathy, get a life.

882
01:08:16,958 --> 01:08:19,392
Stay out of mine!
God, you're like a disease.

883
01:08:19,460 --> 01:08:21,553
You invade someone's life
and attach yourself.

884
01:08:22,330 --> 01:08:24,855
That's what l am to you, a disease?

885
01:08:25,199 --> 01:08:26,996
Thank you very much!

886
01:08:28,336 --> 01:08:30,566
Go ahead!
Cut the baby off from his father!

887
01:08:31,772 --> 01:08:34,764
l have news for you:
l lied. lt's not his baby.

888
01:08:35,643 --> 01:08:37,873
-What do you mean?
-What do you think l mean?

889
01:08:37,945 --> 01:08:39,674
You're having my boyfriend's baby?

890
01:08:40,214 --> 01:08:43,012
Your boyfriend? He's not your anything.

891
01:08:43,184 --> 01:08:47,018
You're not part of his life anymore.
He hasn't thought of you in ages!

892
01:08:47,989 --> 01:08:50,753
You think if l showed up
on his doorstep right now...

893
01:08:50,825 --> 01:08:53,385
...he wouldn't get me into bed
as fast as he did you?

894
01:08:53,494 --> 01:08:55,553
lf he was smart, he'd run!

895
01:08:57,064 --> 01:08:58,429
No, he wouldn't!

896
01:09:03,538 --> 01:09:06,029
l got a good feeling about you two.

897
01:09:11,412 --> 01:09:15,678
Tom, there's something very serious
that you have to know...

898
01:09:15,783 --> 01:09:18,411
...and l'm the only one who will tell you.

899
01:09:19,287 --> 01:09:22,279
A child has been conceived.

900
01:09:25,493 --> 01:09:27,393
Not in love, perhaps.

901
01:09:29,196 --> 01:09:32,461
But in passion.

902
01:09:33,834 --> 01:09:38,464
Now, l understand
that you were swept away...

903
01:09:39,407 --> 01:09:41,102
...but Emily needs you.

904
01:09:43,044 --> 01:09:47,413
Maybe you haven't given her
another thought since your night together.

905
01:09:48,749 --> 01:09:50,944
ln fact, l'm sure you haven't.

906
01:09:53,020 --> 01:09:55,580
Call me invasive.

907
01:09:57,358 --> 01:09:59,258
Call me disease-like.

908
01:10:01,896 --> 01:10:05,855
l just thought that you deserved to know.

909
01:10:22,016 --> 01:10:23,608
Carol, hi. Guess who?

910
01:10:23,884 --> 01:10:25,476
Hi, Elliott.

911
01:10:26,988 --> 01:10:28,956
No. Emily's not here.

912
01:10:29,790 --> 01:10:31,348
ls she going to Denver?

913
01:10:34,195 --> 01:10:37,096
Gee, l really can't say for sure.

914
01:10:37,765 --> 01:10:39,392
lt's pretty confused around here.

915
01:10:40,468 --> 01:10:42,732
Okay. Bye, Elliott.

916
01:10:46,974 --> 01:10:49,602
Excuse me. This is for you.

917
01:10:49,677 --> 01:10:51,008
Thank you.

918
01:10:53,381 --> 01:10:55,440
''There is someone else.''

919
01:10:56,951 --> 01:10:58,851
''You're not the father.''

920
01:11:13,167 --> 01:11:14,156
What?

921
01:11:14,835 --> 01:11:17,929
Kathy's visiting her mother in Chicago,
l'm sure.

922
01:11:18,005 --> 01:11:20,337
Come on, Joe, there are good marriages.

923
01:11:20,408 --> 01:11:22,000
l know. l had three of them.

924
01:11:26,781 --> 01:11:30,114
Old town, please.
The number for Elliott Fowler.

925
01:11:31,085 --> 01:11:32,416
Thank you.

926
01:11:37,458 --> 01:11:38,720
l'm just checking.

927
01:11:38,793 --> 01:11:41,626
-Checking is good.
-Message.

928
01:11:45,099 --> 01:11:48,796
Elliott's in Denver for a show.
He's staying at the Hyatt.

929
01:11:48,869 --> 01:11:50,097
Nice place.

930
01:11:50,404 --> 01:11:52,531
What airline is Kathy taking?

931
01:11:53,474 --> 01:11:55,874
l am not gonna dignify that
with an answer.

932
01:11:59,313 --> 01:12:01,338
-Pan-Pacific.
-Thank you.

933
01:12:02,550 --> 01:12:04,074
They fly to Denver, don't they?

934
01:12:05,986 --> 01:12:08,648
l'm just saying.
l saw it in a commercial, that's all.

935
01:12:10,057 --> 01:12:12,651
All right. l'll clear this up for you.

936
01:12:25,206 --> 01:12:27,674
Doing a little hacking in your spare time?

937
01:12:28,642 --> 01:12:30,132
Go.

938
01:12:30,511 --> 01:12:32,069
And the password is....

939
01:12:36,050 --> 01:12:38,484
Pan-Pacific Airlines, passenger manifest.

940
01:12:38,552 --> 01:12:39,644
Very good.

941
01:12:40,554 --> 01:12:43,022
Let's see. We'll search...

942
01:12:44,258 --> 01:12:45,725
...for passenger...

943
01:12:46,560 --> 01:12:47,788
...Whiting.

944
01:12:50,231 --> 01:12:52,927
''Whiting, Mrs.'' That's a good sign.

945
01:12:54,602 --> 01:12:57,093
Flight 305, Portland to....

946
01:12:59,373 --> 01:13:00,431
Portland to Denver.

947
01:13:11,185 --> 01:13:14,245
So when you told me it was me,
you thought it was me.

948
01:13:14,789 --> 01:13:17,019
Because Emily was protecting
your feelings.

949
01:13:17,091 --> 01:13:18,080
Yes.

950
01:13:18,159 --> 01:13:22,960
Which means your boyfriend
is the father of my girlfriend's baby.

951
01:13:24,331 --> 01:13:27,494
lf you want to boil it down
to one sentence, yes.

952
01:13:27,968 --> 01:13:30,163
You must be just a little bit relieved.

953
01:13:30,237 --> 01:13:32,671
Relieved that Emily
got knocked up by another man?

954
01:13:32,740 --> 01:13:35,038
No, l would not say l was relieved.

955
01:13:35,142 --> 01:13:37,576
l'm sorry,
your room won't be ready until 4:00.

956
01:13:40,481 --> 01:13:42,540
Elliott, can you park my bag?

957
01:13:43,484 --> 01:13:46,544
-Sure.
-Great. Thanks. Bye.

958
01:13:46,620 --> 01:13:47,678
Thank you.

959
01:14:15,916 --> 01:14:17,440
''Gone fishing.''

960
01:14:21,555 --> 01:14:23,182
Bullhead catfish?

961
01:14:26,427 --> 01:14:27,917
They're twins!

962
01:14:41,709 --> 01:14:43,006
Who's that, Tommy?

963
01:14:43,077 --> 01:14:44,840
This one's Carol.

964
01:14:46,447 --> 01:14:47,880
Sir?

965
01:15:20,347 --> 01:15:21,439
Damn.

966
01:15:23,250 --> 01:15:24,740
Let me give you a hand.

967
01:15:25,686 --> 01:15:29,144
l'll have this for you in a second.
No problem, darling.

968
01:15:36,230 --> 01:15:37,561
Thank you.

969
01:15:39,667 --> 01:15:40,861
Anytime.

970
01:15:41,802 --> 01:15:43,326
Thank you.

971
01:15:43,604 --> 01:15:46,698
What a beauty, but not good enough,
l'm afraid.

972
01:15:47,308 --> 01:15:49,071
Now this one....

973
01:15:49,944 --> 01:15:51,878
This one is truly pathetic.

974
01:15:52,446 --> 01:15:53,936
Mean mouth on this girl.

975
01:15:54,014 --> 01:15:55,572
Who's that, Tommy?

976
01:15:55,649 --> 01:15:57,708
Who is it? Chrissy!

977
01:16:00,220 --> 01:16:01,687
Chrissy!

978
01:16:02,122 --> 01:16:04,886
-What you got there, Bootsie?
-Just a fish.

979
01:16:05,392 --> 01:16:07,326
That's no fish!

980
01:16:07,461 --> 01:16:10,055
Look at this thing. That's a Mack truck.

981
01:16:13,567 --> 01:16:15,262
l need a hand with this one.

982
01:16:15,336 --> 01:16:19,363
Boys, l think we got a winner at 24 pounds.

983
01:16:22,343 --> 01:16:23,970
l christen you....

984
01:16:24,979 --> 01:16:27,004
Go ahead, Bootsie. You take it.

985
01:16:27,915 --> 01:16:29,746
-Lola?
-Lola!

986
01:16:29,984 --> 01:16:31,952
Lola! Right!

987
01:16:32,019 --> 01:16:34,886
Lola. There's the winner.

988
01:16:35,356 --> 01:16:37,085
Give him a big hand.

989
01:16:45,099 --> 01:16:46,088
Kathy?

990
01:16:46,166 --> 01:16:47,155
Tommy.

991
01:16:47,868 --> 01:16:48,926
Okay, guys.

992
01:16:49,003 --> 01:16:51,597
l'm gonna get out of here
because you stink.

993
01:16:53,340 --> 01:16:54,500
Thanks, Tom.

994
01:16:56,877 --> 01:16:58,435
See you next year, Tom.

995
01:16:58,512 --> 01:16:59,774
Kathy.

996
01:17:05,552 --> 01:17:08,282
lt's so good to see you!
What are you doing here?

997
01:17:08,355 --> 01:17:12,792
What, are you kidding?
Me, miss a big moosehead cat thing?

998
01:17:20,667 --> 01:17:21,759
So....

999
01:17:22,936 --> 01:17:25,769
-Are you divorced?
-No.

1000
01:17:28,175 --> 01:17:29,403
Widowed?

1001
01:17:30,144 --> 01:17:31,168
No.

1002
01:17:33,147 --> 01:17:36,082
So l guess this is just a friendly call.

1003
01:17:39,119 --> 01:17:41,485
Are you going to go to the reunion?

1004
01:17:41,688 --> 01:17:43,485
Here, let me get this.

1005
01:17:45,926 --> 01:17:47,325
The reunion.

1006
01:17:50,164 --> 01:17:51,927
l'll tell you....

1007
01:17:52,666 --> 01:17:54,634
The only person l wanted to see was you...

1008
01:17:55,502 --> 01:17:57,299
...and you're right here.

1009
01:17:58,205 --> 01:17:59,536
l sure am.

1010
01:18:00,340 --> 01:18:01,432
Yeah.

1011
01:18:02,810 --> 01:18:06,678
You know, of all the places
l've imagined running into you again...

1012
01:18:06,747 --> 01:18:08,374
...that dock sure wasn't one of them.

1013
01:18:08,916 --> 01:18:10,713
You've imagined me places?

1014
01:18:11,118 --> 01:18:12,380
Yeah.

1015
01:18:13,554 --> 01:18:15,351
Haven't you wondered about me like that?

1016
01:18:15,923 --> 01:18:17,254
-No.
-No?

1017
01:18:19,159 --> 01:18:20,148
Okay.

1018
01:18:21,161 --> 01:18:22,355
l have.

1019
01:18:23,797 --> 01:18:28,700
lf l'd known you'd turn out like this,
l'd have imagined it a lot more often.

1020
01:18:29,903 --> 01:18:32,997
What do you mean, ''like this''?

1021
01:18:34,641 --> 01:18:38,008
l always thought you were
the prettiest girl in school.

1022
01:18:39,446 --> 01:18:41,073
And now look at you.

1023
01:18:41,548 --> 01:18:43,675
Just take a look at yourself.

1024
01:18:44,485 --> 01:18:45,975
You're such....

1025
01:18:47,154 --> 01:18:48,382
You're such a woman.

1026
01:18:50,157 --> 01:18:53,524
You have this assurance about you,
and this....

1027
01:18:54,161 --> 01:18:56,288
l don't know, this sleekness.

1028
01:18:57,931 --> 01:18:59,421
Don't get me started here.

1029
01:18:59,500 --> 01:19:01,092
No, go on.

1030
01:19:07,107 --> 01:19:12,101
Let's just say l'm regretting
all that restraint l used...

1031
01:19:12,346 --> 01:19:13,643
...in high school.

1032
01:19:13,814 --> 01:19:15,441
Tell me about it.

1033
01:19:20,787 --> 01:19:23,051
Yeah. Okay.

1034
01:19:26,827 --> 01:19:30,854
Am l going to take you out to dinner
with fish gunk on me, or without?

1035
01:19:32,699 --> 01:19:33,927
Without.

1036
01:19:40,574 --> 01:19:41,871
l'm glad you're....

1037
01:19:42,209 --> 01:19:43,403
Peter?

1038
01:19:43,911 --> 01:19:45,208
Where is she?

1039
01:19:46,813 --> 01:19:49,805
-What do you know about it?
-l know.

1040
01:19:50,150 --> 01:19:52,846
l know a lot more than you think l know.

1041
01:19:53,854 --> 01:19:55,947
Did you know she's pregnant?

1042
01:19:57,524 --> 01:19:58,582
What?

1043
01:19:59,960 --> 01:20:01,518
And it's not even mine.

1044
01:20:01,962 --> 01:20:04,692
Peter, if you were me,
would you still want her?

1045
01:20:04,798 --> 01:20:06,265
l can't help it.

1046
01:20:11,071 --> 01:20:12,504
What the hell do you care?

1047
01:20:13,207 --> 01:20:14,469
She's my wife!

1048
01:20:14,942 --> 01:20:17,843
Kathy? l'm not talking about Kathy!

1049
01:20:19,713 --> 01:20:21,305
What about this?

1050
01:20:21,949 --> 01:20:23,746
l'm storing it for her, Peter.

1051
01:20:23,951 --> 01:20:25,248
Do you think l'm an idiot?

1052
01:20:25,385 --> 01:20:28,115
No, wait. Hold on. Just chill, all right?

1053
01:20:28,188 --> 01:20:31,988
Your wife is here to look up
an old high-school boyfriend, Tom.

1054
01:20:32,159 --> 01:20:33,956
-Tom?
-Tom....

1055
01:20:34,361 --> 01:20:35,350
Tom Andrews.

1056
01:20:36,330 --> 01:20:38,195
Tom Andrews. Okay? So just chill.

1057
01:20:38,599 --> 01:20:41,261
Okay.

1058
01:20:42,369 --> 01:20:43,836
Andrews.

1059
01:20:44,671 --> 01:20:46,002
We'll see.

1060
01:20:47,574 --> 01:20:48,563
All right.

1061
01:20:48,809 --> 01:20:50,436
What a nightmare.

1062
01:20:52,346 --> 01:20:54,007
All right.

1063
01:20:54,581 --> 01:20:56,515
''Andrews, Tom.''

1064
01:21:15,502 --> 01:21:17,367
Kath. Get that, will you?

1065
01:21:32,419 --> 01:21:33,477
Bye.

1066
01:21:37,724 --> 01:21:39,351
l'm really sorry.

1067
01:21:48,902 --> 01:21:52,338
Fowler. l need ice badly.

1068
01:21:53,607 --> 01:21:55,404
Big bucket. Thank you.

1069
01:22:05,252 --> 01:22:07,220
-Elliott.
-Just tell me one thing--

1070
01:22:07,287 --> 01:22:09,847
-Who are you here to see? Me?
-What do you mean?

1071
01:22:09,956 --> 01:22:11,981
-Tom Andrews.
-What?

1072
01:22:12,059 --> 01:22:14,084
Peter, Kathy.... Just tell me.

1073
01:22:14,461 --> 01:22:15,758
ls Kathy in Denver?

1074
01:22:15,829 --> 01:22:17,888
Yes. She's with Tom.

1075
01:22:18,165 --> 01:22:20,793
Peter went out to find her.
He hit me in the face.

1076
01:22:20,867 --> 01:22:23,995
-Now, you and l, we're going to talk, Em.
-Kathy's with Tom?

1077
01:22:24,871 --> 01:22:25,860
Bingo.

1078
01:22:27,007 --> 01:22:29,032
l am through being an idiot.

1079
01:22:29,142 --> 01:22:32,270
You know, listening to other people.
You and l will....

1080
01:22:39,986 --> 01:22:42,318
There's nothing like a fire, is there?

1081
01:22:45,392 --> 01:22:49,158
You look especially good by firelight.

1082
01:22:52,332 --> 01:22:55,631
Gosh, it's too bad it'll go to waste...

1083
01:22:56,436 --> 01:23:00,839
...since we'll be going out
in a few minutes for dinner.

1084
01:23:00,941 --> 01:23:02,806
Why don't we order in?

1085
01:23:04,010 --> 01:23:06,444
You'll find some menus
on the butcher block.

1086
01:23:47,988 --> 01:23:49,421
How about Thai?

1087
01:23:49,990 --> 01:23:52,254
All right. How about ltalian?

1088
01:23:56,363 --> 01:24:00,129
There's an extra $20
if you get me there before her husband.

1089
01:24:07,240 --> 01:24:09,538
What's the problem here?

1090
01:24:09,609 --> 01:24:12,442
There's more than one ''Elm,'' son.

1091
01:24:18,051 --> 01:24:21,509
The idea here is to relax.

1092
01:24:23,457 --> 01:24:25,982
Just let me work the pressure points.

1093
01:24:27,894 --> 01:24:32,888
Just pretend your hand is your body.

1094
01:24:35,035 --> 01:24:36,366
That's it.

1095
01:24:40,774 --> 01:24:42,833
l remember your hands, Kathy.

1096
01:24:45,545 --> 01:24:47,445
l remember your skin...

1097
01:24:49,516 --> 01:24:50,676
...and your shoulders...

1098
01:24:52,686 --> 01:24:54,017
...your neck...

1099
01:24:55,522 --> 01:24:56,853
...your lips....

1100
01:25:07,267 --> 01:25:08,859
l want you, Kathy.

1101
01:25:12,472 --> 01:25:14,440
Emily's having your baby.

1102
01:25:15,775 --> 01:25:17,106
Excuse me?

1103
01:25:17,711 --> 01:25:19,804
You're going to be a father.

1104
01:25:20,013 --> 01:25:21,844
l knew you'd want to know.

1105
01:25:21,915 --> 01:25:24,679
And you wouldn't want
a child of yours born...

1106
01:25:24,751 --> 01:25:26,184
...and not know about it.

1107
01:25:26,253 --> 01:25:29,416
No, actually,
that's always been a dream of mine.

1108
01:25:35,061 --> 01:25:36,858
Did Emily send you here to tell me this?

1109
01:25:37,464 --> 01:25:41,093
No. She's gonna kill me
when she finds out.

1110
01:25:42,869 --> 01:25:47,568
She doesn't have to find out.
We'll just say that you never came here.

1111
01:25:47,908 --> 01:25:52,072
She won't know you betrayed her trust
and l won't have to deal with a kid.

1112
01:25:52,145 --> 01:25:53,442
You can't mean that.

1113
01:25:53,747 --> 01:25:56,011
lf Emily wanted me to know,
she'd have told me.

1114
01:25:56,082 --> 01:25:59,848
l think the fact that she isn't here
should tell us both something.

1115
01:26:07,994 --> 01:26:10,087
-Hey! Babe.
-Hey! Yourself.

1116
01:26:11,064 --> 01:26:12,224
Kathy.

1117
01:26:13,066 --> 01:26:14,328
ls there a back way out?

1118
01:26:14,401 --> 01:26:16,961
-What are you doing here?
-What am l doing here?

1119
01:26:17,037 --> 01:26:19,267
Why don't we sit down
and talk about this quietly?

1120
01:26:19,339 --> 01:26:21,933
Because her husband will walk
in that door any second!

1121
01:26:22,709 --> 01:26:24,108
-Shit.
-Peter?

1122
01:26:24,177 --> 01:26:26,111
Good for you. Now, where's the back way?

1123
01:26:26,179 --> 01:26:27,771
There isn't one.

1124
01:26:28,114 --> 01:26:29,274
We'll just have to wing it.

1125
01:26:31,785 --> 01:26:32,774
All right.

1126
01:26:34,854 --> 01:26:37,550
Say you came to tell Tom
he's the father of my baby.

1127
01:26:37,624 --> 01:26:38,955
That's why l did come here!

1128
01:26:39,025 --> 01:26:41,721
Right. Not looking like that, you didn't.

1129
01:26:41,861 --> 01:26:43,590
No, really. l just told him!

1130
01:26:43,663 --> 01:26:45,995
lt's the eleventh hour. Cut the crap.

1131
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:48,297
Give me your dress.

1132
01:26:49,703 --> 01:26:51,898
-Turn around.
-Why are you doing this for me?

1133
01:26:51,972 --> 01:26:54,497
Don't tell me it's because
you love me and forgive me.

1134
01:26:54,574 --> 01:26:57,907
l couldn't bear the guilt.
So don't tell me that is the reason.

1135
01:26:58,011 --> 01:27:00,571
lt's because l love you and forgive you.

1136
01:27:02,115 --> 01:27:03,776
You deserved that.

1137
01:27:04,284 --> 01:27:05,683
Holy mother!

1138
01:27:08,555 --> 01:27:10,182
We'll laugh about this when we're 90.

1139
01:27:15,128 --> 01:27:16,561
God. Elliott.

1140
01:27:16,663 --> 01:27:19,257
You thought l wasn't ready
for a relationship.

1141
01:27:20,100 --> 01:27:22,568
-How many more guys you got out there?
-Excuse me?

1142
01:27:23,036 --> 01:27:24,833
Boy, l tell you, women....

1143
01:27:25,271 --> 01:27:27,296
Sometimes l just don't understand them.

1144
01:27:27,374 --> 01:27:30,309
She breezes into my life
for one lousy night...

1145
01:27:30,377 --> 01:27:31,810
...now l'm in a paternity suit.

1146
01:27:32,646 --> 01:27:33,738
You slept with this guy?

1147
01:27:34,781 --> 01:27:35,770
l made her.

1148
01:27:35,849 --> 01:27:39,512
Pal. You want her? Take her.

1149
01:27:40,186 --> 01:27:42,518
Just a one-night stand to me, that's all.

1150
01:27:45,959 --> 01:27:47,358
You better--

1151
01:27:49,996 --> 01:27:51,725
You're hurt. lt's all my fault.

1152
01:27:51,798 --> 01:27:53,493
You sure are a jerk.

1153
01:28:02,676 --> 01:28:04,803
ls this your mother's house?

1154
01:28:05,779 --> 01:28:07,542
ls this your mother?

1155
01:28:08,314 --> 01:28:09,576
How's your sciatica?

1156
01:28:09,649 --> 01:28:13,608
Peter! Kathy was just here
to tell Tom that l'm having a baby.

1157
01:28:13,720 --> 01:28:16,086
-Out.
-But it's not Tom's baby. lt's Elliott's.

1158
01:28:16,156 --> 01:28:18,989
-Yeah! lt is?
-lt is?

1159
01:28:19,292 --> 01:28:20,623
Out!

1160
01:28:22,395 --> 01:28:24,829
Kathy, could you leave us alone?

1161
01:28:27,167 --> 01:28:29,965
Buddy, this is my house.

1162
01:28:32,338 --> 01:28:33,930
This is my wife.

1163
01:28:36,376 --> 01:28:37,468
Yeah.

1164
01:28:42,916 --> 01:28:44,247
You lied to me.

1165
01:28:46,019 --> 01:28:47,145
l know.

1166
01:28:52,525 --> 01:28:54,152
Nothing happened.

1167
01:28:54,728 --> 01:28:55,990
Nothing happened?

1168
01:28:57,497 --> 01:28:59,021
Define ''nothing''...

1169
01:28:59,099 --> 01:29:02,398
...because it seems to me
that a lot has happened here.

1170
01:29:03,670 --> 01:29:07,436
l'm trying hard to be objective,
so l want to know all of it.

1171
01:29:07,674 --> 01:29:09,642
Why are you really here?

1172
01:29:13,813 --> 01:29:16,873
Tommy's an old friend of mine
from high school.

1173
01:29:17,784 --> 01:29:19,649
He's an old boyfriend.

1174
01:29:21,488 --> 01:29:22,580
Yeah.

1175
01:29:25,125 --> 01:29:26,922
l missed that feeling.

1176
01:29:27,227 --> 01:29:28,455
Feeling?

1177
01:29:29,229 --> 01:29:31,459
You missed that feeling.

1178
01:29:32,432 --> 01:29:36,232
Yeah, you know,
the rush that you get when you're 16?

1179
01:29:37,337 --> 01:29:39,828
Honey, we aren't 16.

1180
01:29:42,208 --> 01:29:43,402
l know.

1181
01:29:44,577 --> 01:29:45,601
l know.

1182
01:29:47,180 --> 01:29:50,479
lt's just that you feel special.

1183
01:29:52,786 --> 01:29:54,913
l just wanted to feel like....

1184
01:29:56,890 --> 01:29:58,380
Like a hot babe.

1185
01:29:59,325 --> 01:30:02,726
That's a problem, because you mean
l don't make you feel that way.

1186
01:30:03,029 --> 01:30:07,591
Peter, no. You're my husband.
You love me and l love you, and--

1187
01:30:07,834 --> 01:30:09,096
What?

1188
01:30:12,272 --> 01:30:13,637
l love you.

1189
01:30:16,509 --> 01:30:18,272
But what?

1190
01:30:21,948 --> 01:30:25,281
lt's not about you. lt's not even about him.

1191
01:30:25,351 --> 01:30:27,876
You see, l was making myself miserable.

1192
01:30:29,289 --> 01:30:33,851
l wasn't even that miserable, really.
l was kind of happy...

1193
01:30:34,527 --> 01:30:36,017
...in a miserable kind of way.

1194
01:30:38,431 --> 01:30:41,423
ls that worse than being miserable
in a happy kind of way?

1195
01:30:43,102 --> 01:30:44,797
No. lt's better.

1196
01:30:45,672 --> 01:30:47,333
Because you kind of enjoy your misery.

1197
01:30:48,107 --> 01:30:49,972
l'm glad somebody did.

1198
01:30:51,711 --> 01:30:53,338
Peter, l'm sorry.

1199
01:30:54,547 --> 01:30:56,276
What else can l say?

1200
01:30:57,917 --> 01:30:59,179
lt's that....

1201
01:31:01,287 --> 01:31:03,778
Misery, l know something about that.

1202
01:31:05,058 --> 01:31:08,459
''Misery takes you down

1203
01:31:11,364 --> 01:31:12,922
''Drags you all around

1204
01:31:17,937 --> 01:31:19,837
''Takes you all over town

1205
01:31:23,810 --> 01:31:26,108
''Till you've lost what you found''

1206
01:31:33,920 --> 01:31:35,046
You got it to rhyme.

1207
01:31:40,760 --> 01:31:42,091
Come here.

1208
01:31:52,071 --> 01:31:56,132
l want to rock you, mamma,
like your body ain't got no bones.

1209
01:32:04,617 --> 01:32:06,050
Let's blow this place.

1210
01:32:08,588 --> 01:32:11,284
You know, we got a good thing here.

1211
01:32:11,791 --> 01:32:15,090
-l know we do.
-No. The sitter, at home.

1212
01:32:15,395 --> 01:32:16,384
Yeah?

1213
01:32:19,265 --> 01:32:21,597
lt's set for overnight.

1214
01:32:21,868 --> 01:32:23,961
And l got a hotel room.

1215
01:32:24,203 --> 01:32:26,535
You be bad, girl.

1216
01:32:28,274 --> 01:32:30,299
The cards are on the table.

1217
01:32:31,077 --> 01:32:33,511
l don't want you to feel obligated.
Straight answer:

1218
01:32:33,579 --> 01:32:36,912
-Do you want to be together?
-How can she ask me that?

1219
01:32:37,583 --> 01:32:38,572
Things are gonna change.

1220
01:32:38,651 --> 01:32:41,950
You're infatuated with a sophisticated
woman, out there on the edge.

1221
01:32:42,021 --> 01:32:44,683
-You're not out on the edge.
-Yes, l am.

1222
01:32:45,058 --> 01:32:46,252
No, you're not.

1223
01:32:46,492 --> 01:32:49,359
Actually, you can be
kind of a drag at times.

1224
01:32:52,231 --> 01:32:54,290
Then you can't possibly want me.

1225
01:32:54,867 --> 01:32:56,459
Straight answer?

1226
01:32:58,271 --> 01:32:59,295
Yes.

1227
01:33:05,845 --> 01:33:06,903
Yes.

1228
01:33:11,084 --> 01:33:12,517
Watch the face.

1229
01:33:13,820 --> 01:33:15,412
lt doesn't hurt.

1230
01:33:40,680 --> 01:33:44,275
Honey, we're trying to plan
a wedding up here!

1231
01:33:45,818 --> 01:33:46,842
Okay!

1232
01:34:00,818 --> 01:34:07,842
