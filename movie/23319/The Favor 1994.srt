Where are you going?

165
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:58,317
To do my taxes
and learn Spanish.

166
00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:00,386
I need to sleep, Elliott.

167
00:12:00,419 --> 00:12:02,021
You can sleep here, you know.

168
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:04,590
No, I can't.
You're always drawing me.

169
00:12:04,623 --> 00:12:06,792
Well, you waste a lot
of time sleeping.

170
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:09,228
I like sleeping.

171
00:12:09,261 --> 00:12:10,863
It makes
the years go by faster.

172
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:14,366
That's a lousy attitude
for a woman barely past 30,

173

everything ahead of her.

Well, leave me
if you must,

177
00:12:27,947 --> 00:12:31,283
but if you're still going
to check out that
Denver gallery on Friday,

178
00:12:31,317 --> 00:12:34,386
I'd like to see you
tomorrow sometime.

179
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,222
Can't tomorrow.

180
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:38,891
Tomorrow's my goddaughter's
birthday party.

181
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:40,893
I like birthday parties.

no. you're not invited.

Are you saying
you're ashamed of me?

184
00:12:49,401 --> 00:12:51,270
Everyone there is
bringing their children.

185
00:12:51,303 --> 00:12:53,005
I'll be dating one.

Yes.

Um, I'm 26.

I don't know why
you're pressing this.

189
00:12:59,745 --> 00:13:01,480
You'll just get bored
and wanna leave.

on the donkey? No way.

All right. Come.

00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:07,419
I will. Thank you.

I can't believe
you used my lipstick.

198
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:24,770
This is going
to cost me $100.

199
00:13:24,803 --> 00:13:26,939
$100 for a lipstick?

200
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:29,575
No, a trip to
the cosmetic counter.

201

3 months?
I can't wait that long.

I cannot wait to give you
your present for 3 months.

anything you want in there:

to meet my friends.
