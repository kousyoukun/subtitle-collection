Where are you going?

165
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:58,317
To do my taxes
and learn Spanish.

166
00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:00,386
I need to sleep, Elliott.

167
00:12:00,419 --> 00:12:02,021
You can sleep here, you know.

168
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:04,590
No, I can't.
You're always drawing me.

169
00:12:04,623 --> 00:12:06,792
Well, you waste a lot
of time sleeping.

170
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:09,228
I like sleeping.

171
00:12:09,261 --> 00:12:10,863
It makes
the years go by faster.

172
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:14,366
That's a lousy attitude
for a woman barely past 30,

173

everything ahead of her.

Well, leave me
if you must,

177
00:12:27,947 --> 00:12:31,283
but if you're still going
to check out that
Denver gallery on Friday,

178
00:12:31,317 --> 00:12:34,386
I'd like to see you
tomorrow sometime.

179
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,222
Can't tomorrow.

180
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:38,891
Tomorrow's my goddaughter's
birthday party.

181
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:40,893
I like birthday parties.

no. you're not invited.

Are you saying
you're ashamed of me?

184
00:12:49,401 --> 00:12:51,270
Everyone there is
bringing their children.

185
00:12:51,303 --> 00:12:53,005
I'll be dating one.

Yes.

Um, I'm 26.

I don't know why
you're pressing this.

189
00:12:59,745 --> 00:13:01,480
You'll just get bored
and wanna leave.

on the donkey? No way.

All right. Come.

00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:07,419
I will. Thank you.

I can't believe
you used my lipstick.

198
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:24,770
This is going
to cost me $100.

199
00:13:24,803 --> 00:13:26,939
$100 for a lipstick?

200
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:29,575
No, a trip to
the cosmetic counter.

201

3 months?
I can't wait that long.

I cannot wait to give you
your present for 3 months.

anything you want in there:

to meet my friends.

linear questions like:

507
00:28:31,142 --> 00:28:33,445
"How big is it?" And
"how long does it last?"

Well, define "nothing"

1598
01:29:01,269 --> 01:29:05,807
because it seems to me
that a lot has happened here.

1599
01:29:05,840 --> 01:29:09,343
I'm trying really hard
to be objective,
so I want to know all of it.

1600
01:29:09,977 --> 01:29:11,946
Why are you really here?

1601
01:29:15,983 --> 01:29:19,020
Tommy's an old friend of mine
from high school.

1602
01:29:19,954 --> 01:29:21,823
He's an old boyfriend.

[Sighing]

1604
01:29:23,658 --> 01:29:24,759
Yeah.

1605
01:29:27,295 --> 01:29:29,330
I missed that feeling.

1606
01:29:29,364 --> 01:29:31,332
Feeling?

1607
01:29:31,365 --> 01:29:34,569
You missed, uh,
you missed that feeling.

1608
01:29:34,602 --> 01:29:38,373
Yeah, you know,
the--the rush that you get
when you're 16?

1609
01:29:39,507 --> 01:29:42,009
Honey, we aren't 16.

1610
01:29:44,378 --> 01:29:45,580
I know.

1611
01:29:47,014 --> 01:29:48,149
I know.

1612
01:29:49,350 --> 01:29:52,754
It's just that--that
you feel special.

1613
01:29:54,956 --> 01:29:57,091
I just wanted to
feel like, uh...

1614
01:29:59,093 --> 01:30:01,462
Like a hot babe.

1615
01:30:01,496 --> 01:30:03,498
Now, that's a problem,
because you're saying

1616
01:30:03,531 --> 01:30:05,166
that I don't make you feel
that way.

1617
01:30:05,199 --> 01:30:07,635
Oh, Peter, no. See--see,
you're my husband

1618
01:30:07,668 --> 01:30:09,971
and you love me
and I love you, and--

what?

1620
01:30:14,442 --> 01:30:15,810
I love you.

1621
01:30:18,679 --> 01:30:20,681
But what?

1622
01:30:24,152 --> 01:30:27,522
It's not about you.
It's not even
about him. It's...

1623
01:30:27,555 --> 01:30:30,291
You see, I was making
myself miserable.

1624
01:30:30,324 --> 01:30:33,928
I--i wasn't even
that miserable, really.

1625
01:30:33,961 --> 01:30:36,664
I was-- I was kind of happy,

1626
01:30:36,697 --> 01:30:38,699
in a miserable kind
of way and...

1627
01:30:40,635 --> 01:30:43,971
Is that worse
than being miserable
in a happy kind of way?

1628
01:30:45,306 --> 01:30:47,809
No. it's-- it's better.

1629
01:30:47,842 --> 01:30:50,278
Because you kind of
enjoy your misery.

1630
01:30:50,311 --> 01:30:52,180
I'm glad somebody did.

1631
01:30:53,881 --> 01:30:55,516
Peter, I'm sorry.

I don't want you

I just want a straight answer:

1657
01:32:35,783 --> 01:32:37,485
Do you want to be together?

Actually, you can be
kind of a drag at times.

1665
01:32:54,435 --> 01:32:56,504
Then you can't possibly
want me.
