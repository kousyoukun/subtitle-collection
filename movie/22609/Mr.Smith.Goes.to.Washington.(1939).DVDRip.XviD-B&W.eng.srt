1
00:01:26,571 --> 00:01:28,732
"Senator Samuel Foley dead."

2
00:01:29,003 --> 00:01:30,527
Died here at Saint Vincent's.

3
00:01:30,667 --> 00:01:34,228
"At the bedside was political
sidekick Senator Joseph Paine."

4
00:01:34,283 --> 00:01:35,181
Long distance?

5
00:01:35,339 --> 00:01:38,775
Joseph Paine speaking. I want
the governor's residence, Jackson City.

6
00:01:41,291 --> 00:01:42,280
Oh, Joe!

7
00:01:43,339 --> 00:01:44,306
Oh, no!

8
00:01:44,491 --> 00:01:46,288
Couldn't have happened
at a worse time.

9
00:01:46,411 --> 00:01:48,845
Call Jim Taylor. Tell him
I'm flying home tonight.

10
00:01:49,643 --> 00:01:50,632
Right away.

11
00:01:50,795 --> 00:01:51,887
What is it?

12
00:01:52,043 --> 00:01:53,943
-Sam Foley's dead.
-Great saints!

13
00:01:54,059 --> 00:01:54,889
Of all times...

14
00:01:55,051 --> 00:01:57,315
...Foley had to go and die on us.

15
00:01:57,419 --> 00:01:58,852
Who are you calling?

16
00:01:58,987 --> 00:01:59,976
Taylor, my dear.

17
00:02:00,651 --> 00:02:01,618
What's up, Happy?

18
00:02:01,771 --> 00:02:03,363
Sam Foley died tonight.

19
00:02:03,723 --> 00:02:05,418
That's too bad.

20
00:02:05,547 --> 00:02:08,072
Well, don't get excited.
Is Paine coming?

21
00:02:09,611 --> 00:02:10,600
Yes, Jim.

22
00:02:11,371 --> 00:02:12,338
Yes, Jim.

23
00:02:13,035 --> 00:02:14,866
He'd drop dead
if you ever said no.

24
00:02:15,114 --> 00:02:17,480
My dear, this is no time for jokes.

25
00:02:17,579 --> 00:02:19,206
I've got to appoint a new senator.

26
00:02:20,075 --> 00:02:20,843
The governor will see all committees.

27
00:02:20,843 --> 00:02:22,401
The governor will see all committees.

28
00:02:22,539 --> 00:02:24,837
Tell him I won't wait any longer.

29
00:02:25,611 --> 00:02:28,273
Probably got Taylor in there,
telling him what to do.

30
00:02:28,363 --> 00:02:30,991
Tell them to wait.
I'll see them immediately.

31
00:02:32,394 --> 00:02:34,954
I can't put those howling citizens
off any longer.

32
00:02:35,051 --> 00:02:38,077
They'll want something to say about
who takes Foley's place.

33
00:02:38,154 --> 00:02:39,519
Ten to one they've got a man.

34
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:40,683
Relax, Happy.

35
00:02:40,843 --> 00:02:42,105
Stop having kittens.

36
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:44,718
Go and tell Jim Taylor and Joe Paine...

37
00:02:44,811 --> 00:02:47,075
...I'll give them one more minute
to make up their minds.

38
00:02:47,179 --> 00:02:48,703
You go tell Jim Taylor.

39
00:02:48,843 --> 00:02:50,003
I will tell him.

40
00:02:50,155 --> 00:02:53,181
It's high time I told Jim Taylor
a thing or two.

41
00:02:54,411 --> 00:02:57,847
If you and Joe gab any longer
about this appointment...

42
00:02:57,899 --> 00:02:59,127
...I'll see those committees.

43
00:02:59,274 --> 00:03:01,208
You'll see them when we're finished.

44
00:03:02,315 --> 00:03:03,976
But hurry, will you?

45
00:03:07,019 --> 00:03:09,613
That's telling him, Happy, old boy.

46
00:03:10,794 --> 00:03:11,783
Jim...

47
00:03:11,947 --> 00:03:14,745
...with this Willet Creek Dam
coming up...

48
00:03:14,827 --> 00:03:17,091
...the man who takes Foley's place...

49
00:03:17,195 --> 00:03:20,130
...can't ask any questions
or talk out of turn.

50
00:03:20,203 --> 00:03:21,864
We must be absolutely sure of him.

51
00:03:21,995 --> 00:03:23,519
That's why I say Horace Miller.

52
00:03:23,659 --> 00:03:25,388
He'll take orders all right.

53
00:03:25,995 --> 00:03:28,759
Suppose we don't try to go through
with this dam.

54
00:03:28,938 --> 00:03:31,839
Suppose we postpone it
until next session of Congress.

55
00:03:31,914 --> 00:03:32,903
Or drop it altogether.

56
00:03:33,163 --> 00:03:35,631
That'd be a crime, Joe.

57
00:03:36,171 --> 00:03:38,435
After all the work we put in on it?

58
00:03:38,731 --> 00:03:41,097
Burying it in this deficiency bill...

59
00:03:41,195 --> 00:03:42,924
...as nicely as you please.

60
00:03:43,051 --> 00:03:45,645
Having it approved.
It's rolling along.

61
00:03:45,739 --> 00:03:47,604
Like taking candy from a baby.

62
00:03:47,723 --> 00:03:51,181
Is it worth the risk of a scandal,
with a new man in the Senate?

63
00:03:51,243 --> 00:03:52,608
Worth the risk?

64
00:03:52,747 --> 00:03:54,806
What's the matter with you?

65
00:03:55,083 --> 00:03:57,779
Where you're concerned,
I wouldn't take the slightest risk...

66
00:03:57,867 --> 00:04:00,995
...especially with your great reputation
in the Senate.

67
00:04:01,322 --> 00:04:02,414
Here, look.

68
00:04:02,731 --> 00:04:06,326
Look at the campaign I started for you
in all my papers.

69
00:04:07,147 --> 00:04:08,774
A little obscure, isn't it?

70
00:04:08,906 --> 00:04:11,340
I don't know. Maybe.

71
00:04:12,299 --> 00:04:15,029
But after all, you're the logical man
from the West...

72
00:04:15,114 --> 00:04:16,877
...for the national ticket.

73
00:04:17,003 --> 00:04:19,233
At the convention, anything can happen.

74
00:04:20,747 --> 00:04:22,339
If what you say is possible...

75
00:04:22,475 --> 00:04:24,841
...why not do as I say
and drop things like this dam?

76
00:04:24,939 --> 00:04:26,964
We can't do it, Joe.

77
00:04:27,723 --> 00:04:30,817
We've been quietly buying all the land
around that dam...

78
00:04:30,891 --> 00:04:33,325
...and holding it in dummy names.

79
00:04:33,419 --> 00:04:37,014
If we drop it now,
it'll bring about an investigation.

80
00:04:37,131 --> 00:04:40,294
It'll show that we're going to sell it
to the state...

81
00:04:40,363 --> 00:04:42,524
...under phony names.

82
00:04:42,635 --> 00:04:44,500
The smartest thing for us to do...

83
00:04:44,619 --> 00:04:46,553
...is to push this dam through...

84
00:04:46,667 --> 00:04:48,259
...and get it over with.

85
00:04:49,131 --> 00:04:50,462
All right, appoint Miller.

86
00:04:50,603 --> 00:04:51,627
If you're sure he'll take orders.

87
00:04:51,787 --> 00:04:53,846
Don't worry.
He'll take orders.

88
00:04:53,963 --> 00:04:54,952
Come on.

89
00:04:56,811 --> 00:04:59,075
Just a minute.
Just one more minute!

90
00:04:59,178 --> 00:05:00,372
We've got your man.

91
00:05:00,523 --> 00:05:02,150
Horace Miller.

92
00:05:02,507 --> 00:05:03,474
A born stooge!

93
00:05:03,626 --> 00:05:05,924
Horace will perform like a trained seal.

94
00:05:06,027 --> 00:05:07,494
What did I tell you?

95
00:05:07,627 --> 00:05:09,822
If I throw a party man like Miller--

96
00:05:09,931 --> 00:05:12,331
For reasons I can't go into,
it's got to be him.

97
00:05:12,427 --> 00:05:15,089
Do you understand?
Now make out your ticket.

98
00:05:15,179 --> 00:05:16,203
Come on.

99
00:05:16,362 --> 00:05:18,728
But I've got to see those
angry committees first.

100
00:05:18,827 --> 00:05:19,919
Work for harmony.

101
00:05:20,075 --> 00:05:20,905
Harmony!

102
00:05:21,067 --> 00:05:24,400
In considering candidates who might have
the high qualifications...

103
00:05:24,459 --> 00:05:26,017
...of U.S. senator...

104
00:05:26,154 --> 00:05:28,987
...one name shone out like a beacon...

105
00:05:29,163 --> 00:05:31,563
...the Honorable Horace Miller.

106
00:05:32,811 --> 00:05:34,938
A party man.
He's Taylor's stooge!

107
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:35,914
Please!

108
00:05:36,075 --> 00:05:38,839
New Citizens Committee
won't stand for this!

109
00:05:39,275 --> 00:05:41,971
So they named their own candidate, eh?

110
00:05:42,059 --> 00:05:43,048
Who?

111
00:05:43,307 --> 00:05:45,741
-You won't like him.
-Come on, who?

112
00:05:46,027 --> 00:05:47,585
Henry Hill.

113
00:05:47,723 --> 00:05:49,020
That crackpot?

114
00:05:49,163 --> 00:05:50,687
You should've killed that so fast--

115
00:05:50,827 --> 00:05:51,953
I couldn't.

116
00:05:52,107 --> 00:05:54,041
-Those men were--
-Never mind.

117
00:05:54,154 --> 00:05:55,348
You forget about them.

118
00:05:55,499 --> 00:05:57,729
That bunch is out for blood.
If l--

119
00:05:57,834 --> 00:05:58,960
I said forget about them.

120
00:05:59,115 --> 00:06:01,777
Horace Miller goes to the Senate,
and that settles it.

121
00:06:02,475 --> 00:06:04,670
I won't send Horace Miller.

122
00:06:04,779 --> 00:06:07,373
-You won't?
-No, I won't.

123
00:06:08,523 --> 00:06:11,981
I won't let you callously
wreck my whole political future.

124
00:06:12,042 --> 00:06:13,066
Your political future?

125
00:06:13,227 --> 00:06:15,161
I bought it for you as a present.

126
00:06:15,274 --> 00:06:17,936
I can grab it back so fast
it'll make your head swim.

127
00:06:18,027 --> 00:06:20,825
You've got a nerve to sit and worry
about your future...

128
00:06:20,907 --> 00:06:22,636
...when we're in a spot like this.

129
00:06:22,763 --> 00:06:24,253
The man is Miller.

130
00:06:26,955 --> 00:06:28,718
Hello, Dad.

131
00:06:32,171 --> 00:06:33,832
What's the matter?
Is it getting you down?

132
00:06:33,962 --> 00:06:35,054
Is what getting me down?

133
00:06:35,211 --> 00:06:36,838
You're in a deuce of a pickle.

134
00:06:36,971 --> 00:06:38,871
Looks like Henry Hill or else.

135
00:06:38,987 --> 00:06:40,921
It's Horace Miller or else.

136
00:06:41,034 --> 00:06:41,864
Peter!

137
00:06:42,027 --> 00:06:46,589
I wouldn't appoint a twerp like Miller,
Taylor or no Taylor.

138
00:06:46,602 --> 00:06:48,729
May I ask
what Taylor has to do with this?

139
00:06:48,843 --> 00:06:50,777
He's still running the show, ain't he?

140
00:06:50,890 --> 00:06:54,621
I won't have conversation of this sort
carried on at dinner.

141
00:06:54,667 --> 00:06:56,066
Why don't you listen to them
for a change?

142
00:06:56,587 --> 00:06:59,647
No doubt they can make
this appointment for me with ease.

143
00:06:59,723 --> 00:07:01,588
That's easy.
Jefferson Smith.

144
00:07:01,706 --> 00:07:03,503
I beg your pardon?

145
00:07:03,626 --> 00:07:04,991
He's the only senator to have.

146
00:07:05,131 --> 00:07:06,758
He ought to be President.

147
00:07:06,891 --> 00:07:08,324
I like Jeff Smith.

148
00:07:09,227 --> 00:07:12,060
You too?
Now everybody's been heard from.

149
00:07:12,139 --> 00:07:15,802
Forgive my ignorance, but I don't know
him from a hole in the ground.

150
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:18,819
-Gosh, head of the Boy Rangers!
-Oh, a boy?

151
00:07:18,890 --> 00:07:22,382
No, Dad. Jeff's a man.
Jeff Smith.

152
00:07:22,443 --> 00:07:24,707
Biggest expert we got in wild game--

153
00:07:24,842 --> 00:07:27,777
Right now he's the greatest hero
we ever had.

154
00:07:27,851 --> 00:07:29,250
It's all over the headlines.

155
00:07:29,387 --> 00:07:32,481
Didn't you see about the forest fire
all around Sweetwater?

156
00:07:32,555 --> 00:07:33,783
I did. What about it?

157
00:07:33,931 --> 00:07:36,559
-Jeff put that out himself.
-Himself?

158
00:07:36,651 --> 00:07:37,777
If you really want a senator--

159
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:39,693
I do not want a senator.

160
00:07:39,819 --> 00:07:41,616
I do not want any more nonsense.

161
00:07:41,739 --> 00:07:43,400
He's the greatest American we got.

162
00:07:43,531 --> 00:07:45,897
He can tell you
what George Washington said, by heart.

163
00:07:45,995 --> 00:07:48,225
And Stuff has the swellest
stuff in it.

164
00:07:48,331 --> 00:07:49,423
What "stuff"?

165
00:07:49,579 --> 00:07:51,410
Boys' Stuff.
The name of Jeff's paper.

166
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:53,555
He prints it. Look, here's one.

167
00:07:53,675 --> 00:07:55,040
Everybody reads it.

168
00:07:55,179 --> 00:07:57,841
All the kids in the state.
A million of them. Let me read--

169
00:07:57,931 --> 00:08:01,833
I'm in no mood
to listen to childish prattle.

170
00:08:01,867 --> 00:08:02,697
Prattle?

171
00:08:02,859 --> 00:08:03,883
You're all wet.

172
00:08:04,043 --> 00:08:05,374
You couldn't do better.

173
00:08:05,514 --> 00:08:07,277
-Better than what?
-Jeff for senator.

174
00:08:07,402 --> 00:08:08,630
Emma, if you please!

175
00:08:08,779 --> 00:08:10,144
Want to get out of a pickle, don't you?

176
00:08:10,282 --> 00:08:11,874
Always looking for votes, aren't you?

177
00:08:12,011 --> 00:08:14,104
Here's 50,000 kids, two folks each,
and they vote.

178
00:08:14,251 --> 00:08:15,775
If you want to do some good
in this state--

179
00:08:15,915 --> 00:08:17,883
If you're ever going to
stand up like a man--

180
00:08:17,994 --> 00:08:19,086
That settles it!

181
00:08:19,307 --> 00:08:22,538
I won't be belittled by my own children
in my own home.

182
00:08:22,602 --> 00:08:25,594
All my nerves are strained
to the breaking point!

183
00:08:25,898 --> 00:08:26,762
Henry Hill....

184
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:28,185
Horace Miller....

185
00:08:28,331 --> 00:08:29,923
Miller? Hill?

186
00:08:30,059 --> 00:08:30,957
Hill?

187
00:08:31,115 --> 00:08:32,082
Miller?

188
00:08:34,122 --> 00:08:35,487
Heads, Hill.

189
00:08:35,755 --> 00:08:37,245
Tails, Miller.

190
00:08:57,578 --> 00:08:59,307
That's good enough for me.

191
00:09:21,418 --> 00:09:22,612
Good evening.

192
00:09:23,178 --> 00:09:24,611
Is Jefferson Smith at home?

193
00:09:24,746 --> 00:09:26,714
Won't you step in?

194
00:09:42,026 --> 00:09:45,154
-A Boy Ranger to the U.S. Senate?
-Listen.

195
00:09:45,291 --> 00:09:47,851
The simpleton of all times.
A big-eyed patriot.

196
00:09:47,946 --> 00:09:49,777
Knows Lincoln
and Washington by heart.

197
00:09:49,899 --> 00:09:51,890
Stands at attention
in the governor's presence.

198
00:09:52,011 --> 00:09:53,740
Collects stray boys and cats.

199
00:09:53,866 --> 00:09:55,026
He does what?

200
00:09:55,178 --> 00:09:57,237
You know, a perfect man.

201
00:09:57,354 --> 00:09:58,787
Never in politics in his life.

202
00:09:58,922 --> 00:10:01,982
Wouldn't know what it's all about
in 2 years, let alone 2 months.

203
00:10:02,059 --> 00:10:03,151
The important thing...

204
00:10:03,306 --> 00:10:05,331
...this was the genius of the stroke...

205
00:10:05,451 --> 00:10:06,816
...it means votes.

206
00:10:06,954 --> 00:10:10,412
The hero of 50,000 boys
and 1 00,000 parents.

207
00:10:10,474 --> 00:10:12,840
Look over those congratulations
pouring in.

208
00:10:12,939 --> 00:10:14,270
I tell you, gentlemen--

209
00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:17,243
You made this appointment
without asking me.

210
00:10:17,323 --> 00:10:20,315
-When lightning strikes--
-You didn't ask me.

211
00:10:23,722 --> 00:10:25,314
Now wait a minute, Jim.

212
00:10:25,738 --> 00:10:27,899
Happy may have hit on something here.

213
00:10:28,010 --> 00:10:29,170
There, you see?

214
00:10:31,242 --> 00:10:34,439
Do you really think you can
handle him in Washington?

215
00:10:34,507 --> 00:10:36,202
Do you think it's all right?

216
00:10:36,331 --> 00:10:37,593
I think it's all right.

217
00:10:37,739 --> 00:10:38,967
A young patriot...

218
00:10:39,114 --> 00:10:40,945
...recites Lincoln and Jefferson...

219
00:10:41,067 --> 00:10:43,729
...turned loose in our nation's capitol.

220
00:10:45,323 --> 00:10:46,950
I think it's all right.

221
00:10:51,435 --> 00:10:52,333
Chick.

222
00:10:52,491 --> 00:10:55,255
Turn the ballyhoo boys loose. It's
the greatest appointment ever made.

223
00:10:55,338 --> 00:10:56,999
Give a banquet and declare a holiday.

224
00:10:57,130 --> 00:10:59,064
A star-spangled banquet!

225
00:11:06,378 --> 00:11:09,211
And how did your governor
confer that honor?

226
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:13,249
Did he give it to some wealthy
citizen, merely to curry favor?

227
00:11:13,674 --> 00:11:14,663
No!

228
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:18,611
Did he give it to some
unworthy political hireling?

229
00:11:20,106 --> 00:11:21,903
What did he do?

230
00:11:22,026 --> 00:11:22,993
He went down...

231
00:11:23,146 --> 00:11:24,443
...among the people.

232
00:11:24,683 --> 00:11:26,173
And there he found...

233
00:11:28,074 --> 00:11:29,041
...a nugget.

234
00:11:33,931 --> 00:11:36,559
It is in that spirit that
we're here tonight...

235
00:11:36,651 --> 00:11:40,143
...to acclaim and wish Godspeed
to Senator...

236
00:11:40,554 --> 00:11:42,419
...Jefferson Smith.

237
00:11:52,971 --> 00:11:53,960
Thank you.

238
00:11:58,539 --> 00:12:00,700
I can't help feeling...

239
00:12:00,811 --> 00:12:04,042
...that there's been a big mistake
somehow.

240
00:12:06,763 --> 00:12:08,788
Of course, I never could see...

241
00:12:08,906 --> 00:12:12,103
...why we needed two senators
from this state...

242
00:12:12,171 --> 00:12:15,538
...when we have a man like
Joseph Harrison Paine...

243
00:12:15,594 --> 00:12:16,891
...representing us.

244
00:12:19,499 --> 00:12:21,023
He doesn't remember me.

245
00:12:21,163 --> 00:12:22,994
He knew my father very well.

246
00:12:23,178 --> 00:12:24,770
Clayton Smith.

247
00:12:24,907 --> 00:12:25,896
They...

248
00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:27,775
...went to school together.

249
00:12:27,914 --> 00:12:29,848
They were very good friends.

250
00:12:33,162 --> 00:12:35,494
Just to...sit here with him...

251
00:12:35,594 --> 00:12:38,028
...is a very great honor for me...

252
00:12:38,122 --> 00:12:41,387
...because I remember Dad
used to tell me that...

253
00:12:42,347 --> 00:12:45,009
...Joe Paine was the finest man
he ever knew.

254
00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:50,688
Go on, get up. Take a bow!

255
00:12:56,362 --> 00:13:00,890
I don't think I'll be much help to you
down there in Washington, senator.

256
00:13:02,058 --> 00:13:03,355
I'll do my best.

257
00:13:04,074 --> 00:13:06,167
Although with all my might...

258
00:13:07,242 --> 00:13:09,574
...I can promise you one thing:

259
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:13,344
I'll do nothing to disgrace
the office of...

260
00:13:13,419 --> 00:13:15,250
...United States Senate.

261
00:13:42,923 --> 00:13:45,084
Senator Jefferson Smith...

262
00:13:45,322 --> 00:13:47,654
...the Boy Rangers are very proud...

263
00:13:47,754 --> 00:13:49,381
...to take this opportun--

264
00:13:49,514 --> 00:13:50,845
Occasion!

265
00:13:51,498 --> 00:13:54,092
We are happy to take this opportunity--

266
00:13:55,498 --> 00:13:56,328
To present....

267
00:13:56,490 --> 00:13:58,390
To resent this...

268
00:13:58,794 --> 00:14:02,628
...small token
of our affection and esteem...

269
00:14:02,954 --> 00:14:04,478
...to the best--

270
00:14:04,778 --> 00:14:05,608
Friend!

271
00:14:06,219 --> 00:14:08,813
Aw, heck. It's a briefcase, Jeff.

272
00:14:08,906 --> 00:14:09,895
We all pitched in.

273
00:14:10,059 --> 00:14:13,085
For to carry your laws when
you get to Washington.

274
00:14:48,298 --> 00:14:51,233
It isn't much,
but if you insist, here's this week's.

275
00:14:51,306 --> 00:14:54,332
Boys' Stuff.
Why, printer's ink runs in your veins.

276
00:14:56,458 --> 00:14:58,016
You're just like your father.

277
00:14:58,154 --> 00:14:59,712
-Thank you, sir.
-Even to the hat.

278
00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:01,681
Same old dreamer too.

279
00:15:01,802 --> 00:15:03,702
One look at you and I can see him...

280
00:15:03,819 --> 00:15:07,186
...back at his roll-top desk,
hat and all, getting out his paper.

281
00:15:07,242 --> 00:15:10,973
Always kept his hat on
so as to be ready to do battle.

282
00:15:11,018 --> 00:15:13,509
Clayton Smith, editor and publisher.

283
00:15:13,610 --> 00:15:15,407
And champion of lost causes.

284
00:15:15,530 --> 00:15:19,523
Dad used to say the only causes
worth fighting for were the lost causes.

285
00:15:19,626 --> 00:15:20,991
You don't have to tell me.

286
00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:22,757
We were a team, the two of us.

287
00:15:22,890 --> 00:15:25,552
Struggling editor
and the struggling lawyer.

288
00:15:25,642 --> 00:15:28,236
The twin champions of lost causes,
they called us.

289
00:15:28,330 --> 00:15:30,628
Ma's told me about it a thousand times.

290
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:33,198
His last fight was his best, Jeff.

291
00:15:33,706 --> 00:15:36,300
He and his little four-page paper...

292
00:15:36,394 --> 00:15:38,658
...against that mining syndicate.

293
00:15:38,762 --> 00:15:42,926
All to defend the right of one
small miner who stuck to his claim.

294
00:15:43,946 --> 00:15:45,607
They tried everything.

295
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:47,376
Bribery...

296
00:15:48,106 --> 00:15:49,266
...intimidation.

297
00:15:50,762 --> 00:15:51,786
And then....

298
00:15:55,562 --> 00:15:58,690
Ma found him slumped over his desk
that morning.

299
00:15:59,082 --> 00:16:00,709
Shot in the back.

300
00:16:01,450 --> 00:16:02,815
I was there.

301
00:16:03,402 --> 00:16:04,835
I can see him.

302
00:16:05,546 --> 00:16:08,037
At that old roll-top desk.

303
00:16:09,066 --> 00:16:10,761
Still with his hat on.

304
00:16:14,122 --> 00:16:15,953
Still with his hat on.

305
00:16:17,354 --> 00:16:18,548
I know.

306
00:16:19,626 --> 00:16:21,526
I suppose, Mr. Paine...

307
00:16:21,642 --> 00:16:25,339
...when a fellow bucks up
against a big organization like that...

308
00:16:26,346 --> 00:16:28,974
...one man by himself
can't get very far, can he?

309
00:16:32,298 --> 00:16:33,265
Washington, huh?

310
00:16:33,707 --> 00:16:36,301
Yes, senator, for the fifth time.
Washington.

311
00:16:36,650 --> 00:16:38,379
I'd better see about my pigeons.

312
00:16:38,507 --> 00:16:39,769
The porter has them.

313
00:16:39,914 --> 00:16:41,882
Just a second. I'd better make sure.

314
00:16:42,282 --> 00:16:44,842
Joe, my head's like a balloon.

315
00:16:44,938 --> 00:16:48,203
Two whole days! I never knew
there was so much American history.

316
00:16:48,266 --> 00:16:49,528
They're all right.

317
00:16:49,674 --> 00:16:51,642
That's fine. That ends that crisis.

318
00:16:51,754 --> 00:16:53,221
Come along, senator.

319
00:16:53,354 --> 00:16:54,981
Hello, Father!

320
00:16:55,210 --> 00:16:56,507
-I saw!
-He's mine!

321
00:16:58,346 --> 00:17:00,177
Let me get to him.

322
00:17:01,578 --> 00:17:04,206
I don't care to meet him
till I get my money.

323
00:17:04,938 --> 00:17:06,769
A dollar each, please,
for the milk fund.

324
00:17:07,050 --> 00:17:08,108
That's $5.

325
00:17:13,514 --> 00:17:15,175
You've got $5, haven't you?

326
00:17:15,306 --> 00:17:17,206
Can't seem to find anything
except keys.

327
00:17:17,322 --> 00:17:20,189
Jeff, this is my daughter Susan
and her friends.

328
00:17:20,266 --> 00:17:22,826
-Not the new senator?
-He's marvelous.

329
00:17:22,922 --> 00:17:24,856
What have you got there, senator?

330
00:17:24,970 --> 00:17:28,929
-They're pigeons.
-To carry messages back to Ma.

331
00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:31,871
It's just for fun. The one that
makes it home in the best time...

332
00:17:31,946 --> 00:17:33,174
...I'll enter in the Nationals.

333
00:17:33,322 --> 00:17:34,687
-Joe!
-Hello, Chick.

334
00:17:34,826 --> 00:17:36,589
-Hello, Joe.
-Carl, how are you?

335
00:17:36,714 --> 00:17:37,942
Glad to see you, Bill.

336
00:17:39,306 --> 00:17:40,773
Jeff, come here.

337
00:17:40,906 --> 00:17:43,534
Meet Cook and Griffith,
from State Headquarters.

338
00:17:43,626 --> 00:17:46,823
Great pleasure.
You'll do the old state proud.

339
00:17:46,890 --> 00:17:50,951
Welcome. The wildlife here is
different from what you're used to.

340
00:17:51,082 --> 00:17:52,481
They wear high heels.

341
00:17:53,226 --> 00:17:54,784
We must see a lot of you...

342
00:17:54,922 --> 00:17:58,449
-...and your little feathered friends.
-Thank you very much.

343
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:01,354
Come on, Father.

344
00:18:02,698 --> 00:18:03,528
Chick.

345
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:05,351
I've got him.
We'll be along.

346
00:18:05,482 --> 00:18:06,506
Good luck, senator.

347
00:18:06,666 --> 00:18:07,655
Goodbye.

348
00:18:09,066 --> 00:18:11,000
Things sure happen fast around here.

349
00:18:11,114 --> 00:18:13,378
You'll have to get yourself
out of low gear.

350
00:18:14,474 --> 00:18:16,567
Let's get these bags and livestock.

351
00:18:16,682 --> 00:18:17,671
Okay, Chick.

352
00:18:19,242 --> 00:18:20,641
Look, there it is!

353
00:18:20,778 --> 00:18:22,405
Who? What?

354
00:18:22,793 --> 00:18:24,283
The Capitol dome.

355
00:18:24,426 --> 00:18:25,688
Yes, sir, big as life.

356
00:18:25,834 --> 00:18:27,358
Been there a long time now.

357
00:18:27,498 --> 00:18:28,465
Yes, sir.

358
00:18:28,906 --> 00:18:30,567
This way, senator.

359
00:18:39,562 --> 00:18:41,792
We thought we'd
meet him in short pants...

360
00:18:41,898 --> 00:18:43,160
...with hatchets.

361
00:18:43,338 --> 00:18:44,327
Taxi.

362
00:18:44,682 --> 00:18:46,047
What's he got pigeons for?

363
00:18:46,186 --> 00:18:47,175
What for?

364
00:18:47,594 --> 00:18:49,721
Suppose there's a storm.
The lines are down.

365
00:18:49,834 --> 00:18:52,268
How you going to get messages
back to Ma?

366
00:18:52,362 --> 00:18:53,624
This way, senator.

367
00:18:53,770 --> 00:18:54,998
Where is he?

368
00:18:55,146 --> 00:18:56,135
Senator?

369
00:18:56,458 --> 00:18:58,085
I told that Cookie to....

370
00:18:58,218 --> 00:18:59,276
Let's find him.

371
00:18:59,434 --> 00:19:00,423
Senator!

372
00:19:00,938 --> 00:19:02,929
Senator Smith?

373
00:19:03,626 --> 00:19:05,457
Positively not in the station.

374
00:19:05,578 --> 00:19:06,476
What happened?

375
00:19:06,698 --> 00:19:08,131
Did you look in the--?

376
00:19:08,650 --> 00:19:10,709
I'll brain that guy.

377
00:19:10,826 --> 00:19:12,691
Call Paine. Call Saunders.

378
00:19:12,810 --> 00:19:14,539
Call the Marines. Call somebody!

379
00:19:15,402 --> 00:19:15,530
Saunders?

380
00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:16,394
Saunders?

381
00:19:16,553 --> 00:19:17,485
McGann.

382
00:19:17,642 --> 00:19:20,475
Has Smith showed up
at his office there yet?

383
00:19:20,554 --> 00:19:22,385
What do you mean, the slip?
What's so funny?

384
00:19:22,506 --> 00:19:23,438
Nothing.

385
00:19:23,594 --> 00:19:25,118
Why don't you try a butterfly net?

386
00:19:25,258 --> 00:19:26,486
If he shows up...

387
00:19:26,634 --> 00:19:29,000
...Paine's waiting at the hotel
with newspapermen.

388
00:19:29,098 --> 00:19:31,225
Let him know right away.
Understand?

389
00:19:31,338 --> 00:19:34,796
I'll hang a light in the belfry.
One if by land and two if by sea.

390
00:19:47,210 --> 00:19:48,108
-Diz?
-Yeah.

391
00:19:48,266 --> 00:19:49,130
What do you think?

392
00:19:49,290 --> 00:19:50,621
Daniel Boone's lost.

393
00:19:52,010 --> 00:19:54,240
Lost in the wilds of Washington.

394
00:19:54,857 --> 00:19:56,449
If your boyfriend's
going to blaze trails...

395
00:19:56,586 --> 00:19:57,814
...I'm going to the press club.

396
00:19:57,962 --> 00:20:00,954
Stick around. He might want us to
put on short pants and go hiking.

397
00:20:01,034 --> 00:20:02,558
You wouldn't want to
miss the exercise.

398
00:20:02,698 --> 00:20:04,757
When I think of exercise,
I have to lie down...

399
00:20:04,874 --> 00:20:06,068
...until the feeling leaves me.

400
00:20:06,442 --> 00:20:07,966
Wouldn't it be funny
if he was lost?

401
00:20:08,106 --> 00:20:09,073
The Boy Ranger?

402
00:20:09,226 --> 00:20:10,488
Oh, he'll show up.

403
00:20:10,634 --> 00:20:12,693
He must have a compass with him.

404
00:20:13,162 --> 00:20:15,289
Where would I go
if I were a Boy Ranger?

405
00:20:15,402 --> 00:20:17,563
Boy, am I tired. I'm all in!

406
00:20:17,674 --> 00:20:21,075
Call all the hospitals.
And get me a bed while you're at it!

407
00:20:21,129 --> 00:20:23,359
Boss, will you hold this
a minute?

408
00:20:23,466 --> 00:20:24,797
Thank you, sir.

409
00:20:26,666 --> 00:20:28,725
Here! Come back here!

410
00:23:09,450 --> 00:23:11,941
--that from these honored dead
we take...

411
00:23:12,042 --> 00:23:15,011
...increased devotion that
that cause for which they...

412
00:23:15,082 --> 00:23:17,243
...gave the last full measure...

413
00:23:17,354 --> 00:23:18,981
...of devotion...

414
00:23:19,145 --> 00:23:21,079
...that we here highly....

415
00:23:21,194 --> 00:23:22,684
-Resolve.
-Resolve...

416
00:23:23,081 --> 00:23:26,141
...that these dead
shall not have died in vain.

417
00:23:26,217 --> 00:23:27,775
That this nation...

418
00:23:27,914 --> 00:23:31,350
...under God, shall have
a new birth of....

419
00:23:31,402 --> 00:23:32,391
Freedom.

420
00:23:32,714 --> 00:23:33,578
Freedom.

421
00:23:33,737 --> 00:23:35,864
And that government, of the people...

422
00:23:36,138 --> 00:23:37,070
...by the people...

423
00:23:37,225 --> 00:23:38,123
...for the people...

424
00:23:38,281 --> 00:23:41,045
...shall not perish from the earth.

425
00:23:47,241 --> 00:23:49,539
Why don't they try the police?

426
00:23:49,642 --> 00:23:51,269
Call out some bloodhounds...

427
00:23:51,402 --> 00:23:52,562
...or lndian guides.

428
00:23:52,714 --> 00:23:54,181
One place he knows
is the Senate office.

429
00:23:54,313 --> 00:23:55,837
You stay there and wait.

430
00:23:55,977 --> 00:23:57,308
All right,
another half-hour.

431
00:23:57,450 --> 00:23:59,918
Just one half-hour.
Goodbye.

432
00:24:01,066 --> 00:24:03,034
Oh, why don't I quit?

433
00:24:03,145 --> 00:24:05,477
Eight to five,
little boy blue's plastered.

434
00:24:05,577 --> 00:24:07,568
When Foley died, why didn't
I clear out?

435
00:24:07,689 --> 00:24:10,749
How many times have I said
I'm fed up with politics and l--

436
00:24:11,466 --> 00:24:14,458
No, I let them
talk me into staying.

437
00:24:14,538 --> 00:24:17,564
Secretary to a leader
of little squirts.

438
00:24:18,249 --> 00:24:21,616
Why? Because I need the job
and a new suit of clothes.

439
00:24:21,674 --> 00:24:23,005
Would you settle for a husband?

440
00:24:23,146 --> 00:24:25,307
I sure would.

441
00:24:27,497 --> 00:24:29,692
You know my old standing offer.

442
00:24:29,994 --> 00:24:30,961
Diz Moore...

443
00:24:31,114 --> 00:24:32,638
...poet of Washington correspondents.

444
00:24:32,778 --> 00:24:34,609
Oh, that again.

445
00:24:35,081 --> 00:24:35,911
I'd cherish you...

446
00:24:36,074 --> 00:24:37,268
...and I'd stay sober.

447
00:24:37,418 --> 00:24:40,046
Diz, you're a wonderful egg.

448
00:24:40,489 --> 00:24:45,222
I don't know, maybe if I saw you once
with your hair combed or something....

449
00:24:45,641 --> 00:24:47,666
I don't think even
that would do it.

450
00:24:48,329 --> 00:24:50,854
No point in combing
my hair for nothing.

451
00:24:51,466 --> 00:24:52,455
"Honorary appointment."

452
00:24:52,617 --> 00:24:56,917
Scratch this and you'll find they need
a dope here for a couple of months.

453
00:24:57,353 --> 00:24:58,615
Yes?

454
00:24:59,433 --> 00:25:00,764
Yes!

455
00:25:02,473 --> 00:25:03,337
What do you want?

456
00:25:03,498 --> 00:25:05,728
Office of Jefferson Smith?

457
00:25:08,106 --> 00:25:09,596
The man downstairs said--

458
00:25:18,346 --> 00:25:21,144
They sure must have
picked the prize dummy--

459
00:25:21,513 --> 00:25:22,844
Say, wait a minute!

460
00:25:22,985 --> 00:25:25,146
That wouldn't be Daniel Boone?

461
00:25:26,506 --> 00:25:27,473
Say, mister...

462
00:25:27,625 --> 00:25:28,489
...what's your name?

463
00:25:28,649 --> 00:25:29,581
Jefferson Smith.

464
00:25:29,738 --> 00:25:30,932
Oh, yes, please...

465
00:25:31,082 --> 00:25:33,448
...come right in, Mr. Smith.
This way.

466
00:25:33,578 --> 00:25:34,670
Now, hold everything.

467
00:25:34,826 --> 00:25:37,021
Stay there. Now, don't move!

468
00:25:37,993 --> 00:25:40,086
Helen! Get me the Madison.
Senator Paine.

469
00:25:40,201 --> 00:25:41,668
Hurry up, will you?

470
00:25:42,410 --> 00:25:43,240
Is anything the matter?

471
00:25:45,353 --> 00:25:46,411
My dear senator...

472
00:25:46,569 --> 00:25:49,367
...it may be customary out on the
prairie to take leave of people...

473
00:25:49,449 --> 00:25:51,110
...and not show up for five hours--

474
00:25:51,242 --> 00:25:53,870
I'm very sorry
about that, Miss Sau--

475
00:25:53,961 --> 00:25:55,724
You are Miss Saunders, aren't you?

476
00:25:55,850 --> 00:25:59,047
Yes, and this is Mr. Moore, member
of the press. Mr. Moore, meet...

477
00:25:59,113 --> 00:26:00,273
...the senator.

478
00:26:00,425 --> 00:26:02,017
I'm very happy to know you.

479
00:26:02,153 --> 00:26:04,678
I see you cut your way
through that forest.

480
00:26:07,689 --> 00:26:09,054
Senator Paine. We've got him!

481
00:26:09,194 --> 00:26:11,662
Came in on his own power,
and he's sober.

482
00:26:12,105 --> 00:26:15,097
Next thing on the schedule,
I'll have him over there.

483
00:26:15,210 --> 00:26:16,040
Now....

484
00:26:16,202 --> 00:26:17,567
I'm awfully sorry.

485
00:26:17,705 --> 00:26:20,606
It wasn't until I was well along
on the bus that--

486
00:26:20,681 --> 00:26:21,841
Did you say bus?

487
00:26:21,993 --> 00:26:24,621
It was one of those
sightseers, you know?

488
00:26:24,713 --> 00:26:25,975
And...

489
00:26:28,234 --> 00:26:31,499
...I've never been called
absent-minded before...

490
00:26:32,074 --> 00:26:34,736
...but there it was, all of a sudden.

491
00:26:34,985 --> 00:26:37,818
It was staring at me
through the station doors.

492
00:26:37,898 --> 00:26:39,195
There what was?

493
00:26:39,337 --> 00:26:41,635
The dome. The Capitol dome.

494
00:26:42,090 --> 00:26:46,049
As big as life, sparkling away
under the old sun out there.

495
00:26:46,441 --> 00:26:47,601
And l...

496
00:26:48,298 --> 00:26:49,595
...I just...

497
00:26:49,737 --> 00:26:51,898
...started to go toward it.

498
00:26:52,009 --> 00:26:53,738
There was a bus outside and...

499
00:26:53,866 --> 00:26:55,595
...I just naturally got aboard.

500
00:26:55,722 --> 00:26:57,917
Most natural thing in the world.

501
00:26:59,689 --> 00:27:02,453
I don't think I've ever been so
thrilled in my whole life.

502
00:27:02,602 --> 00:27:04,763
And that Lincoln Memorial!

503
00:27:05,865 --> 00:27:07,765
Gee whiz!

504
00:27:08,362 --> 00:27:10,796
Why, Mr. Lincoln, there he is.

505
00:27:12,329 --> 00:27:16,265
He's looking right straight
at you as you come up those steps.

506
00:27:18,089 --> 00:27:21,616
Just sitting there, like he was
waiting for somebody to come along.

507
00:27:22,762 --> 00:27:24,354
Well, he's got nothing on me.

508
00:27:24,489 --> 00:27:25,888
Oh, I'm sorry.

509
00:27:26,409 --> 00:27:28,570
If you're ready,
we'll go to the hotel.

510
00:27:28,681 --> 00:27:30,808
Senator Paine's waiting for you.

511
00:27:40,361 --> 00:27:41,555
This is my office?

512
00:27:41,706 --> 00:27:44,300
No, you'll have a private office.

513
00:27:44,873 --> 00:27:47,205
-ln there.
-Private office?

514
00:27:48,713 --> 00:27:49,941
In there?

515
00:27:52,905 --> 00:27:54,338
Right in this door?

516
00:28:00,394 --> 00:28:01,952
All right, now, senator....

517
00:28:02,089 --> 00:28:04,557
Where is he?
Has he gone out again?

518
00:28:04,681 --> 00:28:06,148
He's in there.

519
00:28:06,281 --> 00:28:07,578
I'll see you later.

520
00:28:07,722 --> 00:28:10,384
I got to go out
and drink this over.

521
00:28:13,225 --> 00:28:14,749
Whose statue's that?

522
00:28:14,889 --> 00:28:16,550
I wouldn't know, in the daytime.

523
00:28:16,681 --> 00:28:18,148
You wouldn't? Oh, look!

524
00:28:18,634 --> 00:28:21,535
Look at the Capitol dome!
It's all lighted up.

525
00:28:21,641 --> 00:28:25,577
You better relax, senator.
You'll get yourself plum wore out.

526
00:28:25,610 --> 00:28:28,670
Gee whiz! So many things
happening all at once.

527
00:28:29,706 --> 00:28:32,174
Miss Saunders, what time
does the Senate....

528
00:28:32,265 --> 00:28:33,323
Convene?

529
00:28:34,121 --> 00:28:36,612
-Twelve noon.
-Twelve noon, huh?

530
00:28:36,778 --> 00:28:39,178
Oh, boy, that'll be something!

531
00:28:39,497 --> 00:28:40,862
You know what I better do
in the morning?

532
00:28:41,001 --> 00:28:42,593
No, what had you better?

533
00:28:42,729 --> 00:28:44,959
I think I better go out
to Mount Vernon.

534
00:28:45,066 --> 00:28:47,227
Be sort of a fine thing to do.

535
00:28:48,009 --> 00:28:50,842
Visit Washington's home before walking
into the Senate for the first time.

536
00:28:50,922 --> 00:28:51,911
Think it's a good idea?

537
00:28:52,073 --> 00:28:55,042
Wonderful! Puts you
right in the mood.

538
00:28:56,105 --> 00:28:57,834
What's that? What's that?

539
00:28:59,529 --> 00:29:01,190
Movie houses.

540
00:29:03,785 --> 00:29:05,377
Hi, Saunders.

541
00:29:05,513 --> 00:29:07,310
I'm still asking myself, what is he:

542
00:29:07,433 --> 00:29:08,764
Animal, vegetable or mineral?

543
00:29:08,905 --> 00:29:09,769
Maybe an oyster.

544
00:29:10,057 --> 00:29:14,824
When I think of myself playing straight
for that phony, patriotic chatter. Me!

545
00:29:14,889 --> 00:29:17,983
Carrying bibs for an infant
with little flags in his fists.

546
00:29:18,058 --> 00:29:20,424
I can't take it, Diz.
I quit. I'm through.

547
00:29:20,521 --> 00:29:23,490
Now take it easy.
Simmer down. Here.

548
00:29:23,561 --> 00:29:24,755
Take this.

549
00:29:26,409 --> 00:29:29,105
Know what he's doing tomorrow
before taking the Senate seat?

550
00:29:29,193 --> 00:29:30,717
Going up to Mount Vernon...

551
00:29:30,857 --> 00:29:33,087
...to get in the mood.
A warm-up.

552
00:29:33,193 --> 00:29:34,182
Who? Your boss?

553
00:29:34,345 --> 00:29:37,041
A nut! I knew there was
a story in him. I smelled it!

554
00:29:37,129 --> 00:29:38,721
Go chase an ambulance.

555
00:29:38,857 --> 00:29:41,382
It's meat and drink to me.
Let me at him five minutes.

556
00:29:41,481 --> 00:29:42,379
I'll make it right.

557
00:29:42,537 --> 00:29:44,164
What do you mean "right"?

558
00:29:44,297 --> 00:29:45,594
I'll tell you what I'll do.

559
00:29:45,737 --> 00:29:47,034
World Series. A pass!

560
00:29:47,177 --> 00:29:49,202
In a month it'll be worth 1 5 bucks.

561
00:29:49,321 --> 00:29:50,219
Well!

562
00:29:50,377 --> 00:29:51,309
You're not talking to this guy.

563
00:29:51,466 --> 00:29:52,296
What do you say?

564
00:29:52,457 --> 00:29:53,355
Nothing. Beat it.

565
00:29:53,513 --> 00:29:55,743
How would your pals like
to get in on this?

566
00:29:55,849 --> 00:29:57,043
-I want a scoop.
-Beat it!

567
00:29:57,193 --> 00:30:00,890
That's out. Either it's lots of
reporters and tickets, or....

568
00:30:00,937 --> 00:30:03,531
Better call him before
I change my mind.

569
00:30:03,625 --> 00:30:05,957
Okay. I'll see you right here.

570
00:30:07,945 --> 00:30:09,276
What are you going to do?

571
00:30:09,417 --> 00:30:12,250
Get my whole fall outfit
and quit this job in style.

572
00:30:12,330 --> 00:30:15,197
You've got more sense
than to put Nosey on to that guy.

573
00:30:16,681 --> 00:30:18,876
Open your eyes! Open your eyes!

574
00:30:19,849 --> 00:30:21,146
Tell us about yourself.

575
00:30:21,289 --> 00:30:23,450
I hear you got a boys' club, senator.

576
00:30:23,561 --> 00:30:24,994
Any special ax to grind?

577
00:30:25,129 --> 00:30:26,255
-Ax?
-You know.

578
00:30:26,409 --> 00:30:28,639
Pet idea. Save the buffaloes,
pension bill.

579
00:30:28,746 --> 00:30:31,840
You must have one idea that would
be good for the country.

580
00:30:31,913 --> 00:30:33,403
Well, I have got one idea.

581
00:30:33,546 --> 00:30:35,138
That's what we want.

582
00:30:35,273 --> 00:30:37,571
For the last couple years,
I've thought it would be...

583
00:30:37,673 --> 00:30:40,904
...a wonderful idea to have a
national boys' camp in our state.

584
00:30:40,969 --> 00:30:42,869
Boys' camp?
Sure. Very good!

585
00:30:42,985 --> 00:30:45,385
If we could get
poor kids off the streets...

586
00:30:45,481 --> 00:30:48,416
...out of the cities for
a few months in the summer...

587
00:30:48,489 --> 00:30:50,855
...and let them learn something
about nature...

588
00:30:50,953 --> 00:30:52,113
...American ideals....

589
00:30:52,265 --> 00:30:53,323
Marvelous.

590
00:30:53,481 --> 00:30:54,971
What would it
cost the government?

591
00:30:55,113 --> 00:30:57,206
Nothing. Nothing at all.
You see...

592
00:30:57,321 --> 00:31:00,347
...the government just
lends us the money for the camp...

593
00:31:00,425 --> 00:31:02,359
...and then the boys...

594
00:31:02,473 --> 00:31:05,909
...pay it back by sending pennies,
nickels, nothing more than a dime.

595
00:31:05,961 --> 00:31:07,428
That's really something.

596
00:31:09,226 --> 00:31:10,921
Government's got enough
to do without--

597
00:31:11,049 --> 00:31:12,744
The government's
putting too much dough...

598
00:31:12,873 --> 00:31:14,465
...in too many places now, boys.

599
00:31:14,601 --> 00:31:16,626
Well, now, senator, tell me...

600
00:31:16,809 --> 00:31:19,334
...what do you think of
the girls in this town?

601
00:31:19,433 --> 00:31:21,230
Down at the station,
four of them...

602
00:31:21,353 --> 00:31:23,753
...kissed me when
I got off the train.

603
00:31:24,521 --> 00:31:26,751
-Were they pretty?
-Pretty?

604
00:31:26,858 --> 00:31:28,189
That Miss Susan Paine...

605
00:31:28,329 --> 00:31:30,194
...is about the
prettiest I ever saw.

606
00:31:30,313 --> 00:31:32,611
Senator, you got a good eye!

607
00:31:32,745 --> 00:31:34,372
How about some more pictures?

608
00:31:34,505 --> 00:31:35,870
You're a nature lover...

609
00:31:36,009 --> 00:31:37,499
...can you handle sign language?

610
00:31:37,641 --> 00:31:38,699
I could manage, if--

611
00:31:38,857 --> 00:31:41,325
What about birdcalls?
You know any?

612
00:31:41,417 --> 00:31:44,181
-Can you make a sound like an eagle?
-How about a bobwhite?

613
00:31:44,265 --> 00:31:46,358
Here's one. I'm the
only one in the state...

614
00:31:46,601 --> 00:31:47,465
...that knows this one.

615
00:31:47,626 --> 00:31:48,854
We could use that!

616
00:32:11,081 --> 00:32:13,311
His "First 'Whiff' of Washington"?

617
00:32:15,466 --> 00:32:16,728
Do I actually see this?

618
00:32:16,873 --> 00:32:18,397
What is it?

619
00:32:20,681 --> 00:32:22,080
Did you want to see me?

620
00:32:22,217 --> 00:32:25,277
-What's this I hear about your quitting?
-I'm not a nurse.

621
00:32:25,353 --> 00:32:26,285
Stop being funny.

622
00:32:26,441 --> 00:32:27,408
How'd this happen?

623
00:32:27,561 --> 00:32:31,361
-I haven't the slightest idea.
-Yes, you have. How'd it happen?

624
00:32:31,401 --> 00:32:32,732
I merely took him home.

625
00:32:32,873 --> 00:32:35,535
I didn't tuck him in.
That's McGann's job.

626
00:32:35,626 --> 00:32:38,823
McGann just phoned. Smith's
gone again. Do you know where?

627
00:32:38,889 --> 00:32:41,881
He went to Mount Vernon
to give himself a patriotic address.

628
00:32:41,961 --> 00:32:43,292
That's fine.

629
00:32:43,433 --> 00:32:45,731
Now you go back to Smith's office...

630
00:32:45,833 --> 00:32:47,824
...and get him
to the Senate by 1 2:00.

631
00:32:47,945 --> 00:32:49,845
Senator, I wasn't
given a brain...

632
00:32:49,961 --> 00:32:52,088
...just to tell a Boy Ranger
the time.

633
00:32:52,201 --> 00:32:53,225
Don't be a fool.

634
00:32:53,385 --> 00:32:54,716
If certain things happen...

635
00:32:54,857 --> 00:32:57,417
...you'll get one of the biggest jobs
in Washington.

636
00:32:57,513 --> 00:33:01,313
When I came here, my eyes were
big blue question marks...

637
00:33:01,353 --> 00:33:03,116
...now they're big
green dollar marks.

638
00:33:03,241 --> 00:33:04,333
Smart girl, eh?

639
00:33:04,745 --> 00:33:07,509
Finish this job properly
and you'll get a bonus.

640
00:33:07,593 --> 00:33:08,958
I mean, keep Smith away...

641
00:33:09,097 --> 00:33:11,691
...from anything that
smacks of politics.

642
00:33:12,329 --> 00:33:14,456
Including Willet Creek Dam?

643
00:33:16,169 --> 00:33:17,693
Including Willet Creek Dam.

644
00:33:17,833 --> 00:33:19,562
Now go back to your work.

645
00:33:25,161 --> 00:33:26,822
This is it, senator.

646
00:33:26,953 --> 00:33:28,580
The United States Senate.

647
00:33:28,713 --> 00:33:29,543
Come on.

648
00:33:32,809 --> 00:33:34,242
Mr. Carson, Senator Smith.

649
00:33:34,377 --> 00:33:36,208
-How do you do?
-How do you do, senator?

650
00:33:36,329 --> 00:33:37,193
Page!

651
00:33:37,353 --> 00:33:38,718
-Glad to see you.
-Thank you.

652
00:33:38,857 --> 00:33:40,825
Show Senator Smith to his seat.

653
00:33:40,937 --> 00:33:42,063
Right this way, sir.

654
00:33:42,217 --> 00:33:43,980
Well, goodbye.

655
00:33:44,553 --> 00:33:45,952
-Wish me luck.
-Sure.

656
00:33:46,089 --> 00:33:47,283
Bye.

657
00:34:13,097 --> 00:34:14,223
So that's the boy wonder?

658
00:34:14,377 --> 00:34:17,005
I don't know what the Senate's
coming to.

659
00:34:19,209 --> 00:34:20,233
-Hi, Diz.
-Hello, Saunders.

660
00:34:20,393 --> 00:34:21,883
Daryl, Sweeney.

661
00:34:22,377 --> 00:34:24,572
I see you got Daniel Boone
in all right.

662
00:34:24,681 --> 00:34:26,239
Daniel in the lion's den.

663
00:34:26,665 --> 00:34:28,394
Nice job you and
the ambulance chasers did...

664
00:34:28,521 --> 00:34:29,453
...in the papers this morning.

665
00:34:29,609 --> 00:34:30,837
-Did you like it?
-Great.

666
00:34:33,769 --> 00:34:34,997
Here you are, Senator.

667
00:34:35,145 --> 00:34:36,476
Not a bad desk, either.

668
00:34:36,617 --> 00:34:38,608
Daniel Webster used to use it.

669
00:34:38,729 --> 00:34:40,060
Daniel Webster sat here?

670
00:34:40,201 --> 00:34:41,259
Holy mackerel!

671
00:34:41,481 --> 00:34:44,678
Give you something to shoot at,
if you figure on doing any talking.

672
00:34:44,745 --> 00:34:46,269
I'm just going to
sit and listen.

673
00:34:46,409 --> 00:34:48,309
That's the way to get re-elected.

674
00:34:48,425 --> 00:34:50,689
This is the calendar for the day.

675
00:34:50,825 --> 00:34:52,918
You'll find this
and a manual, in here.

676
00:34:53,033 --> 00:34:54,000
Anything else...

677
00:34:54,153 --> 00:34:55,347
...just snap for a page.

678
00:34:55,497 --> 00:34:57,021
Where's the majority leader?

679
00:34:57,161 --> 00:34:58,219
Majority leader?

680
00:34:58,377 --> 00:35:01,039
Right over there.
Senator Agnew.

681
00:35:01,673 --> 00:35:03,766
That's Senator Barnes,
the minority leader.

682
00:35:03,881 --> 00:35:05,178
Where's the press gallery?

683
00:35:05,321 --> 00:35:07,755
There,
above the vice president's chair.

684
00:35:07,849 --> 00:35:10,682
Those in the front row
represent the big news services.

685
00:35:10,761 --> 00:35:11,750
What's up there?

686
00:35:11,913 --> 00:35:13,813
That's for guides
and sightseers...

687
00:35:13,929 --> 00:35:16,955
...who come in for five minutes
at a time to rest their feet.

688
00:35:17,385 --> 00:35:20,013
That section is reserved
for the senators' friends.

689
00:35:20,265 --> 00:35:23,530
Front row, the empty one, is for
the President and his guests.

690
00:35:23,593 --> 00:35:24,423
I see.

691
00:35:24,617 --> 00:35:26,983
Over the clock
is the diplomatic section.

692
00:35:29,769 --> 00:35:32,636
They and the pageboys are the only
real class we have here.

693
00:35:32,713 --> 00:35:35,682
-Thanks so much.
-I'll take your hat to the cloakroom.

694
00:35:35,752 --> 00:35:37,481
I want to give you
a Boy Ranger button.

695
00:35:37,609 --> 00:35:38,439
Swell!

696
00:35:38,601 --> 00:35:40,262
-What's your name?
-Richard Jones.

697
00:35:40,393 --> 00:35:41,553
Thanks ever so much.

698
00:35:41,865 --> 00:35:44,698
Good luck, senator.
Keep your left up.

699
00:35:45,257 --> 00:35:48,090
-See you in the White House, Joe.
-You're not kidding!

700
00:35:48,649 --> 00:35:49,775
-Jeff.
-Hello, senator.

701
00:35:49,929 --> 00:35:50,953
I was in committee.

702
00:35:51,112 --> 00:35:52,204
That's all right, sir.

703
00:35:52,361 --> 00:35:54,386
I see you had a little publicity.

704
00:35:55,049 --> 00:35:57,176
Have you got your credentials?

705
00:35:58,185 --> 00:36:00,085
Miss Saunders gave them to me.

706
00:36:00,329 --> 00:36:01,387
Is that right?

707
00:36:03,305 --> 00:36:04,431
That's fine.

708
00:36:04,585 --> 00:36:06,519
When the vice president
calls you...

709
00:36:06,633 --> 00:36:09,898
-...I'll meet you in the center aisle.
-Center aisle.

710
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:12,861
This is Daniel Webster's desk.
Did you know that?

711
00:36:12,969 --> 00:36:14,334
He won't mind.

712
00:36:43,657 --> 00:36:45,454
The Senate will come to order.

713
00:36:45,577 --> 00:36:47,477
Chaplain will pray.

714
00:36:48,712 --> 00:36:50,907
Oh, God, our Heavenly Father...

715
00:36:51,017 --> 00:36:52,211
...in these critical days...

716
00:36:52,361 --> 00:36:56,263
...when our beloved country labors with
such grave problems...

717
00:36:56,296 --> 00:36:57,593
...Iook upon us...

718
00:36:57,737 --> 00:37:01,173
...and give us the strength
to be just and merciful...

719
00:37:01,225 --> 00:37:03,193
...so we may best
serve our people...

720
00:37:03,305 --> 00:37:05,239
...and our fellow men
everywhere.

721
00:37:05,544 --> 00:37:06,602
Amen.

722
00:37:15,305 --> 00:37:16,431
-Clerk will read--
-Mr. President...

723
00:37:16,585 --> 00:37:20,351
...I ask unanimous consent the reading
of the journal be dispensed with.

724
00:37:20,425 --> 00:37:21,722
Is there objection?

725
00:37:22,409 --> 00:37:23,671
Journal stands approved.

726
00:37:23,817 --> 00:37:25,114
Mr. President.

727
00:37:25,257 --> 00:37:26,986
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

728
00:37:27,112 --> 00:37:28,079
Clerk will call the roll.

729
00:37:28,232 --> 00:37:30,029
-Mr. Agnew.
-Here.

730
00:37:30,152 --> 00:37:31,278
-Mr. Albert.
-Here.

731
00:37:31,433 --> 00:37:32,627
-Mr. Alfred.
-Here.

732
00:37:33,321 --> 00:37:36,950
88 senators have answered
to their names, all as present.

733
00:37:37,001 --> 00:37:38,730
-Mr. President.
-Senator Paine.

734
00:37:38,857 --> 00:37:41,655
I present the credentials of
Honorable Jefferson Smith...

735
00:37:41,737 --> 00:37:44,604
...who has just been appointed
by the governor of my state.

736
00:37:44,681 --> 00:37:46,114
The designate is present.

737
00:37:46,249 --> 00:37:49,047
I ask that the oath of office be
administered at this time.

738
00:37:49,129 --> 00:37:51,563
The senator designate will
present himself.

739
00:37:51,849 --> 00:37:53,783
The oath will be administered.

740
00:38:10,472 --> 00:38:11,837
Mr. President...

741
00:38:11,977 --> 00:38:13,604
...I rise to a question of order.

742
00:38:13,737 --> 00:38:16,262
-Here it comes.
-I seek to ascertain if the gentleman...

743
00:38:16,361 --> 00:38:20,855
...about to be sworn in is aware
of the responsibilities of his office.

744
00:38:20,872 --> 00:38:23,067
I refer to his
shameless performance...

745
00:38:23,177 --> 00:38:24,269
...for the newspapers.

746
00:38:24,649 --> 00:38:26,549
A versatile performance,
I grant you...

747
00:38:26,665 --> 00:38:29,429
...and one that his party,
no doubt, will applaud.

748
00:38:31,305 --> 00:38:32,704
But one that lowers his rank...

749
00:38:32,841 --> 00:38:35,071
...to the level of a
sideshow entertainer...

750
00:38:35,176 --> 00:38:37,736
...and reflects on the sincerity,
if not the sanity...

751
00:38:37,833 --> 00:38:40,393
...of the highest body
of lawmakers in the land.

752
00:38:40,488 --> 00:38:43,582
I seek to learn if this
is the gentleman's conception...

753
00:38:43,657 --> 00:38:45,056
...of the nature of his office.

754
00:38:45,193 --> 00:38:46,091
I don't understand.

755
00:38:46,248 --> 00:38:49,843
The designate has no voice here
until taking the oath of office.

756
00:38:49,897 --> 00:38:52,161
Mr. President,
I will answer the gentleman.

757
00:38:52,265 --> 00:38:54,699
My colleague was innocent
in this matter.

758
00:38:54,793 --> 00:38:56,283
He was completely misquoted.

759
00:38:56,425 --> 00:38:59,883
I know Jefferson Smith, and I will
personally vouch for him.

760
00:38:59,945 --> 00:39:03,574
He has the greatest respect for his
office and for these gentleman.

761
00:39:03,657 --> 00:39:05,090
Mr. President.

762
00:39:05,481 --> 00:39:09,076
The swearing in of the senator
designate is the order of business.

763
00:39:09,128 --> 00:39:11,358
The gentleman will raise
his right hand.

764
00:39:11,465 --> 00:39:12,727
Do you swear to support...

765
00:39:12,872 --> 00:39:15,705
...and defend the Constitution
of the United States...

766
00:39:15,785 --> 00:39:18,447
...against all enemies,
foreign and domestic...

767
00:39:18,569 --> 00:39:22,164
...and that you will bear true faith
and allegiance to the same?

768
00:39:22,216 --> 00:39:24,343
That you take this obligation freely...

769
00:39:24,457 --> 00:39:27,517
...without mental reservation
or purpose of evasion...

770
00:39:27,593 --> 00:39:32,496
...and that you will faithfully
discharge the duties of this office...

771
00:39:32,713 --> 00:39:34,374
...so help you God?

772
00:39:34,792 --> 00:39:36,020
I do.

773
00:39:36,649 --> 00:39:39,049
Senator, you can talk
all you want to now.

774
00:39:42,089 --> 00:39:43,215
Meet the majority leader.

775
00:39:43,369 --> 00:39:44,700
He'll be a good friend to you.

776
00:39:44,841 --> 00:39:45,967
How do you do, sir?

777
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:48,680
Any friend of Joe's
is a friend of mine.

778
00:39:48,777 --> 00:39:51,940
Don't worry about the others,
they're just senators.

779
00:39:53,448 --> 00:39:55,348
-Mr. President.
-Senator MacPherson.

780
00:39:55,529 --> 00:39:58,225
The shameless way the
deficiency bill has been delayed...

781
00:39:58,313 --> 00:40:00,110
...is nothing short of criminal.

782
00:40:00,233 --> 00:40:04,294
Government agencies are
in desperate need of these funds.

783
00:40:04,329 --> 00:40:08,322
The prime business of this body
is the immediate passage....

784
00:40:46,569 --> 00:40:49,766
-Hello, Nosey. Who let you in here?
-Why aren't you chasing ambulances?

785
00:40:49,832 --> 00:40:52,733
Smith's punching everybody
he meets. I just got away.

786
00:40:52,808 --> 00:40:53,866
Uh-oh, Tarzan!

787
00:41:03,688 --> 00:41:05,451
Boys, meet Senator Smith.

788
00:41:07,112 --> 00:41:08,739
You act like
something's on your mind.

789
00:41:08,905 --> 00:41:10,668
Why don't you tell the people
the truth?

790
00:41:10,856 --> 00:41:12,585
-The truth?
-He wants the truth!

791
00:41:12,712 --> 00:41:14,009
The man wants the truth.

792
00:41:14,153 --> 00:41:16,121
"'What is the truth?' said
jesting Pilate...

793
00:41:16,233 --> 00:41:17,757
...and would not stay for an answer."

794
00:41:17,897 --> 00:41:19,956
How do you want it?
Dished out or in a bottle?

795
00:41:20,296 --> 00:41:22,560
People pick up their papers,
and what do they read?

796
00:41:22,665 --> 00:41:26,863
This morning they read that a
clown arrived in Washington...

797
00:41:26,953 --> 00:41:29,478
...parading like
a member of the Senate.

798
00:41:32,009 --> 00:41:35,467
If you thought as much about being
honest as you do about being smart....

799
00:41:35,529 --> 00:41:38,521
We're the only ones who can
be honest in what we tell the voters.

800
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:42,127
We don't have to be re-elected,
like politicians.

801
00:41:42,184 --> 00:41:45,347
We tell them when phonies and
crackpots come here to make their laws.

802
00:41:45,449 --> 00:41:47,610
If you want the truth,
why are you in the Senate?

803
00:41:47,721 --> 00:41:50,189
What do you know about making laws?
Or what the people need?

804
00:41:50,281 --> 00:41:51,111
I don't pretend to know.

805
00:41:51,272 --> 00:41:52,762
Then what are you doing
in the Senate?

806
00:41:52,905 --> 00:41:55,897
What's he doing?
Why, honorary appointment!

807
00:41:56,649 --> 00:42:00,915
When the country needs men who know
and have courage as it never did before...

808
00:42:00,936 --> 00:42:03,905
...he's going to decorate a chair
and get honored.

809
00:42:04,168 --> 00:42:07,399
But he'll vote! Just like his
colleague tells him too.

810
00:42:07,465 --> 00:42:10,263
Like a Christmas tiger,
he'll nod his head and vote...

811
00:42:10,345 --> 00:42:12,643
..."Yes!"

812
00:42:12,744 --> 00:42:14,336
You're not a senator.

813
00:42:14,633 --> 00:42:18,000
You're an honorary stooge.
You ought to be shown up.

814
00:42:18,216 --> 00:42:19,478
Have a drink, senator?

815
00:42:19,624 --> 00:42:21,717
It'll taste better than the truth.

816
00:42:30,728 --> 00:42:31,888
Hey, senator.

817
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:34,422
Don't let it get you down.

818
00:42:34,568 --> 00:42:37,435
1 00 years from now,
nobody'll know the difference.

819
00:42:38,152 --> 00:42:38,601
The point is, sir,
they're right.

820
00:42:38,601 --> 00:42:39,898
The point is, sir,
they're right.

821
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:42,634
I'm just sitting in the Senate,
decorating a chair.

822
00:42:42,729 --> 00:42:47,166
If I'm going to vote, I ought
to study the bills that are coming up.

823
00:42:47,241 --> 00:42:48,139
The bills?

824
00:42:48,297 --> 00:42:52,631
Yes, sir. Otherwise, I'm just a
Christmas tiger, like they said.

825
00:42:52,937 --> 00:42:56,998
These bills are put together by
legal minds after long study.

826
00:42:57,033 --> 00:43:00,662
I can't understand half of them
myself, and I was a lawyer.

827
00:43:00,712 --> 00:43:02,646
Come on. Forget it.

828
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:04,523
I'll advise you how to vote.

829
00:43:04,648 --> 00:43:06,548
I know you will.
That's the point.

830
00:43:06,664 --> 00:43:08,632
There's no reason for me
to be here.

831
00:43:08,744 --> 00:43:13,340
Didn't you say something about
wanting to create a national boys' camp?

832
00:43:13,353 --> 00:43:15,844
-You were in earnest, weren't you?
-Yes, I was.

833
00:43:15,977 --> 00:43:18,172
Why don't you do it?
There's a job for you.

834
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:20,407
Get a bill started.
Present it to Congress.

835
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:21,885
It will be great experience.

836
00:43:22,024 --> 00:43:25,460
Senator Paine, I've been
aching to mention it to you.

837
00:43:25,512 --> 00:43:29,107
If I could do that one thing
while I'm here, I'd feel--

838
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:31,628
What's to stop you?
Saunders will help you.

839
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:33,654
Well, I'll do it.
I will!

840
00:43:33,896 --> 00:43:36,490
I knew if anyone could help me,
you could.

841
00:43:36,584 --> 00:43:38,051
Thank you again for your time.

842
00:43:38,217 --> 00:43:39,047
Good night.

843
00:43:39,208 --> 00:43:40,869
Where are you running off to?

844
00:43:41,001 --> 00:43:43,367
I'm anxious to get
back to the office.

845
00:43:46,345 --> 00:43:48,176
The man on the front page!

846
00:43:48,296 --> 00:43:51,459
-He just dropped in for a minute.
-How do you do, senator?

847
00:43:51,528 --> 00:43:52,995
How do you do, Miss Paine?

848
00:43:53,129 --> 00:43:54,357
I'm on my way to the office.

849
00:43:54,537 --> 00:43:56,266
-How are the pigeons?
-They're fine.

850
00:43:56,361 --> 00:43:57,988
I miss the dear little things.

851
00:43:58,121 --> 00:44:00,851
I released one this morning
with a letter.

852
00:44:00,936 --> 00:44:04,804
He flew right straight up in the air
to get his bearings.

853
00:44:04,841 --> 00:44:08,902
He went around the Capitol dome,
then headed west, like a bat out of--

854
00:44:08,937 --> 00:44:10,666
Just like a rifle shot.

855
00:44:10,792 --> 00:44:13,022
I suppose by about this time...

856
00:44:13,129 --> 00:44:15,222
...he's probably over Kentucky.

857
00:44:15,336 --> 00:44:17,099
Isn't that wonderful, Father?

858
00:44:17,481 --> 00:44:19,506
And was the letter to your girl?

859
00:44:20,072 --> 00:44:23,098
No, I don't have a girl.

860
00:44:23,176 --> 00:44:25,007
Don't you think I'd better
hold this for you?

861
00:44:25,128 --> 00:44:26,891
No, I think I'd better go.

862
00:44:27,016 --> 00:44:28,108
Good night.

863
00:44:30,888 --> 00:44:32,913
Doggone!

864
00:44:33,097 --> 00:44:34,530
It's all right, sir.

865
00:44:34,665 --> 00:44:37,156
That's all right, my boy.
Don't bother.

866
00:44:43,657 --> 00:44:45,147
Gee, I'm sorry.

867
00:44:45,288 --> 00:44:46,118
Good night.

868
00:44:46,281 --> 00:44:47,543
Good night, Jeff.

869
00:44:47,689 --> 00:44:48,747
Good night.

870
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:00,594
Oh, Father!

871
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:01,990
Dear me!

872
00:45:02,152 --> 00:45:04,279
At the expense of
some of the furniture...

873
00:45:04,392 --> 00:45:05,859
...you've made another conquest.

874
00:45:05,992 --> 00:45:07,220
Not old Honest Abe!

875
00:45:07,368 --> 00:45:09,700
And with Honest Abe's ideals.

876
00:45:10,537 --> 00:45:13,097
A rare man these days, Susan.

877
00:45:14,664 --> 00:45:15,081
We're going ahead with it.

878
00:45:15,081 --> 00:45:16,275
We're going ahead with it.

879
00:45:16,424 --> 00:45:17,356
Ahead with what?

880
00:45:17,512 --> 00:45:19,446
My bill for
a national boys' camp.

881
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:20,652
Where's my briefcase?

882
00:45:20,808 --> 00:45:22,139
Do I understand...

883
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:23,474
...that you're going to present a bill?

884
00:45:23,625 --> 00:45:25,616
Senator Paine and I decided--

885
00:45:25,737 --> 00:45:27,261
Senator Paine decided with you?

886
00:45:27,401 --> 00:45:29,596
I should have
been the one to think of it.

887
00:45:29,704 --> 00:45:30,534
My dear senator...

888
00:45:30,697 --> 00:45:33,757
...have you the faintest idea
how to get a bill passed?

889
00:45:33,832 --> 00:45:35,823
No. You're going to help me.

890
00:45:35,945 --> 00:45:37,242
If I were triplets I could.

891
00:45:37,384 --> 00:45:39,375
Senator Paine said
you'd help me.

892
00:45:39,624 --> 00:45:41,023
What do we have to have?

893
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:42,650
Look, do you mind...

894
00:45:42,792 --> 00:45:45,761
...if I give you a rough idea
what you're up against?

895
00:45:45,832 --> 00:45:46,821
No, go ahead.

896
00:45:48,872 --> 00:45:52,364
A senator has a bill in mind,
like your camp, right?

897
00:45:52,425 --> 00:45:53,392
What does he do?

898
00:45:53,544 --> 00:45:55,205
He has to sit down
and write it.

899
00:45:55,336 --> 00:45:57,804
The why, when, where, how
and everything else.

900
00:45:57,929 --> 00:45:58,861
That takes time.

901
00:45:59,016 --> 00:46:00,176
But this one is so simple.

902
00:46:00,680 --> 00:46:02,113
I see. This one's simple.

903
00:46:02,248 --> 00:46:04,375
-And with your help--
-Oh, I'm helping.

904
00:46:04,489 --> 00:46:05,421
Simple, and I'm helping...

905
00:46:05,576 --> 00:46:09,068
...so we knock it off in record time,
say three or four days.

906
00:46:09,128 --> 00:46:10,686
Oh, a day.

907
00:46:10,824 --> 00:46:12,985
-A day?
-Yes, just tonight.

908
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:15,304
Tonight.

909
00:46:15,465 --> 00:46:16,955
I don't want to complain...

910
00:46:17,096 --> 00:46:20,532
...but in civilized countries
there's an institution called "dinner."

911
00:46:20,904 --> 00:46:22,929
I'm sort of hungry myself.

912
00:46:23,337 --> 00:46:27,865
Couldn't we have some stuff brought
in on trays, like big executives?

913
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:29,313
Oh, sure.

914
00:46:29,544 --> 00:46:32,411
Dinner comes in on trays.

915
00:46:32,489 --> 00:46:33,786
We light into this--

916
00:46:33,928 --> 00:46:36,294
And we finish the bill before morning.

917
00:46:36,392 --> 00:46:37,416
It's dawn.

918
00:46:37,576 --> 00:46:39,976
Your bill is ready. You introduce it.

919
00:46:40,072 --> 00:46:40,902
How?

920
00:46:41,064 --> 00:46:42,224
You get to your feet...

921
00:46:42,376 --> 00:46:44,435
...take a breath,
and start spouting.

922
00:46:44,552 --> 00:46:48,454
Not too loud. A couple of
the senators might want to sleep.

923
00:46:48,488 --> 00:46:50,683
A curly-headed pageboy
takes it to the desk...

924
00:46:50,792 --> 00:46:53,852
...where a clerk reads it,
refers it to a committee--

925
00:46:53,928 --> 00:46:55,862
Committee, huh? Why?

926
00:46:57,288 --> 00:47:01,622
Committees. Small groups
of senators have to sift a bill down...

927
00:47:01,641 --> 00:47:03,836
...study it,
and report to the Senate.

928
00:47:03,944 --> 00:47:05,775
Can't take a bill
nobody ever heard of...

929
00:47:05,896 --> 00:47:08,228
...and discuss it among 96 men.
Where would you get?

930
00:47:08,328 --> 00:47:09,386
I see that.

931
00:47:10,056 --> 00:47:12,286
Good.
Now, where are we?

932
00:47:12,424 --> 00:47:13,857
Some committee's got it.

933
00:47:14,088 --> 00:47:15,919
Days are going by, senator.

934
00:47:16,041 --> 00:47:17,838
Days, weeks!

935
00:47:18,696 --> 00:47:20,789
Finally, they think it's quite a bill.

936
00:47:20,904 --> 00:47:23,395
It goes to the House of
Representatives for a vote...

937
00:47:23,496 --> 00:47:25,964
-...but waits on the calendar.
-Calendar?

938
00:47:26,216 --> 00:47:27,877
That's the order of business.

939
00:47:28,008 --> 00:47:29,873
Your bill has to stand back in line...

940
00:47:29,992 --> 00:47:32,825
-...unless the steering committee--
-What's that?

941
00:47:32,969 --> 00:47:34,436
Steering committee?

942
00:47:37,256 --> 00:47:39,656
Do you really think
we're getting anywhere?

943
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:41,620
Tell me, what's
the steering committee?

944
00:47:42,088 --> 00:47:43,988
Committee of the
majority party leaders.

945
00:47:44,104 --> 00:47:47,073
They decide when a bill is important
enough to be at the head of the list.

946
00:47:47,144 --> 00:47:47,974
Well, this is.

947
00:47:48,840 --> 00:47:50,569
Pardon me. This is.

948
00:47:51,720 --> 00:47:53,278
-Where are we now?
-Over in the House.

949
00:47:53,576 --> 00:47:54,600
Oh, yeah. House.

950
00:47:54,760 --> 00:47:57,820
More amendments, more changes,
and the bill goes back to the Senate.

951
00:47:57,896 --> 00:48:01,059
The Senate doesn't like what the
House did; they make more changes.

952
00:48:01,192 --> 00:48:03,524
The House doesn't like
those changes. Stymied.

953
00:48:03,624 --> 00:48:04,613
So?

954
00:48:04,776 --> 00:48:06,937
So they appoint men from each House
to go into a huddle...

955
00:48:07,048 --> 00:48:09,039
...called a conference,
and they battle it out.

956
00:48:09,192 --> 00:48:12,650
Finally, if your bill is still alive
after all this vivisection...

957
00:48:12,712 --> 00:48:14,543
...it comes to a vote.

958
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:16,070
Yes, sir!

959
00:48:16,232 --> 00:48:18,564
The big day finally arrives...

960
00:48:18,664 --> 00:48:20,131
...and Congress adjourns.

961
00:48:23,944 --> 00:48:25,502
Catching on, senator?

962
00:48:28,584 --> 00:48:30,575
Shall we start right away
or order dinner first?

963
00:48:30,984 --> 00:48:31,814
Pardon me?

964
00:48:31,976 --> 00:48:33,671
I said, shall we start--

965
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:34,698
Oh, sure.

966
00:48:35,208 --> 00:48:36,072
Why not?

967
00:48:36,232 --> 00:48:39,133
Do you mind if I take the time
to go get a pencil?

968
00:48:39,209 --> 00:48:41,507
-Go right ahead!
-Thank you very much.

969
00:48:41,608 --> 00:48:43,667
Go right ahead.
And lots of paper too.

970
00:48:44,136 --> 00:48:46,366
Now, the--
Doggone it!

971
00:48:46,472 --> 00:48:49,373
Ever have so much to say about
something, you just couldn't say it?

972
00:48:49,448 --> 00:48:52,042
-Try sitting down.
-I did. I got right back up.

973
00:48:52,584 --> 00:48:54,518
Let's get down to particulars.

974
00:48:54,632 --> 00:48:56,327
How big is this thing?
Where is it?

975
00:48:56,456 --> 00:48:57,855
How many boys will it accommodate?

976
00:48:57,992 --> 00:49:00,290
You've got to have all that
in it, you know?

977
00:49:00,392 --> 00:49:01,859
And something else, Miss Saunders.

978
00:49:01,992 --> 00:49:06,395
The spirit of it. The idea.

979
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:08,101
How do you say it?

980
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:12,465
That's what's got to be in it.

981
00:49:13,065 --> 00:49:14,089
The Capitol dome.

982
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:16,012
On paper?

983
00:49:16,168 --> 00:49:18,796
I want to make that come to life
for every boy in this land.

984
00:49:18,888 --> 00:49:21,413
Yes, and all lighted up
like that too.

985
00:49:22,344 --> 00:49:25,677
You see, boys forget what
their country means...

986
00:49:25,736 --> 00:49:28,466
...by just reading "the land
of the free" in history books.

987
00:49:28,648 --> 00:49:31,242
They get to be men
and forget even more.

988
00:49:32,136 --> 00:49:35,970
Liberty is too precious a thing
to be buried in books, Miss Saunders.

989
00:49:36,392 --> 00:49:37,825
Men should hold it up
in front of them...

990
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:40,326
...every single day of their
lives and say...

991
00:49:40,424 --> 00:49:41,948
...I'm free...

992
00:49:42,760 --> 00:49:44,455
...to think and to speak.

993
00:49:44,808 --> 00:49:47,072
My ancestors couldn't.
I can...

994
00:49:47,752 --> 00:49:49,413
...and my children will.

995
00:49:50,888 --> 00:49:53,322
Boys ought to
grow up remembering that.

996
00:49:53,928 --> 00:49:57,193
And that steering committee,
they've got to see it like that.

997
00:49:57,256 --> 00:50:00,487
I know Senator Paine will do
all he can to help me, because--

998
00:50:00,552 --> 00:50:02,247
He's a wonderful man, isn't he?

999
00:50:03,048 --> 00:50:05,949
-He knew my father real well.
-He did?

1000
00:50:06,376 --> 00:50:10,312
We need a lot more like him.
His kind of character, his ideals.

1001
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:12,591
Let's get on with this.

1002
00:50:13,640 --> 00:50:15,471
This camp will be in your state?

1003
00:50:15,592 --> 00:50:19,028
About 200 of the most beautiful
acres that ever were.

1004
00:50:19,080 --> 00:50:21,207
You've never been
out in that country, have you?

1005
00:50:21,320 --> 00:50:23,288
I've been over every single foot of it.

1006
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:24,833
You have to see it yourself.

1007
00:50:24,968 --> 00:50:29,029
I don't know. The prairies, and
wind leaning on the tall grass...

1008
00:50:29,224 --> 00:50:30,714
...Iazy streams down in the meadows...

1009
00:50:30,856 --> 00:50:33,825
...angry little midgets of water
up in the mountains.

1010
00:50:33,896 --> 00:50:36,990
Cattle moving down the slope,
against the sun.

1011
00:50:37,128 --> 00:50:38,618
Campfires...

1012
00:50:38,824 --> 00:50:40,758
...and snowdrifts....

1013
00:50:41,704 --> 00:50:45,140
Everybody ought to have some
of that, sometime in his life.

1014
00:50:45,192 --> 00:50:46,921
My dad had the right idea.

1015
00:50:47,176 --> 00:50:48,939
He had it all worked out.

1016
00:50:49,128 --> 00:50:51,062
He used to say to me, "Son...

1017
00:50:51,176 --> 00:50:53,644
...don't miss the wonders
that surround you.

1018
00:50:53,832 --> 00:50:57,734
Because every tree, every rock,
every anthill, every star...

1019
00:50:57,768 --> 00:51:00,259
...is filled with
the wonders of nature."

1020
00:51:01,288 --> 00:51:02,778
He used to say to me...

1021
00:51:02,952 --> 00:51:05,921
..."Did you ever notice how grateful
you are to see daylight...

1022
00:51:05,991 --> 00:51:09,654
...after coming through
a long, dark tunnel?"

1023
00:51:09,704 --> 00:51:13,265
"Well," he'd say, "always try to see
life around you...

1024
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:15,288
...as if you just came
out of a tunnel."

1025
00:51:19,336 --> 00:51:20,826
Where did you come from?

1026
00:51:21,576 --> 00:51:24,010
I guess I've always lived
in a tunnel.

1027
00:51:24,424 --> 00:51:25,413
You mean here?

1028
00:51:25,960 --> 00:51:27,723
Baltimore. Pure city dweller.

1029
00:51:28,136 --> 00:51:29,262
Have you always had to work?

1030
00:51:29,416 --> 00:51:31,008
Since I was about sixteen.

1031
00:51:31,144 --> 00:51:31,974
Sixteen?

1032
00:51:32,136 --> 00:51:34,127
I take it your parents couldn't--

1033
00:51:34,248 --> 00:51:35,545
No, Father was a doctor.

1034
00:51:35,688 --> 00:51:38,122
He thought more of ethics
than he did of collections.

1035
00:51:38,216 --> 00:51:40,844
Speaks well for Father,
but it wasn't so--

1036
00:51:41,256 --> 00:51:43,656
Now, look, we'd better get back to this.

1037
00:51:43,944 --> 00:51:45,241
Hasn't been easy, has it?

1038
00:51:45,384 --> 00:51:46,510
No complaints.

1039
00:51:47,112 --> 00:51:49,512
For a woman, you've done awfully well.

1040
00:51:49,992 --> 00:51:50,856
Have l?

1041
00:51:52,679 --> 00:51:57,048
I've never known anyone as capable
and intelligent....

1042
00:51:59,751 --> 00:52:02,982
I don't know where I'd be in this
bill if it wasn't for your help.

1043
00:52:04,008 --> 00:52:06,067
I don't know where you are with it.

1044
00:52:08,232 --> 00:52:10,894
Gee whiz, we've got to get
going with this.

1045
00:52:10,984 --> 00:52:12,849
All right, now, let's see.

1046
00:52:14,536 --> 00:52:17,528
Everybody calls you just plain
"Saunders." Why can't l?

1047
00:52:17,608 --> 00:52:18,734
Go right ahead.

1048
00:52:18,888 --> 00:52:19,877
Saunders.

1049
00:52:20,040 --> 00:52:21,200
That's much better.

1050
00:52:21,352 --> 00:52:23,912
"Hello, Saunders."
"Good morning, Saunders."

1051
00:52:25,128 --> 00:52:28,256
-"How's the bill coming, Saunders?"
-Terrible, thank you.

1052
00:52:28,328 --> 00:52:31,229
Anyway, I got that "Saunders" business
straightened out.

1053
00:52:31,304 --> 00:52:33,704
All right, now! I--

1054
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:35,358
What's your first name?

1055
00:52:35,656 --> 00:52:36,714
Why?

1056
00:52:37,256 --> 00:52:39,190
Everybody calls you
just "Saunders."

1057
00:52:39,304 --> 00:52:41,067
I also answer to whistles.

1058
00:52:41,192 --> 00:52:42,386
You've got a first name?

1059
00:52:42,536 --> 00:52:45,130
Yes, but we just better
forget about it.

1060
00:52:45,224 --> 00:52:46,782
All right, all right.

1061
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:49,371
I was just curious.

1062
00:52:49,512 --> 00:52:53,710
A picture popped into my mind of
a pump without a handle or something.

1063
00:52:55,784 --> 00:52:57,775
Of course, I know what it is.
Violet.

1064
00:52:58,440 --> 00:52:59,964
No, it isn't.

1065
00:53:00,104 --> 00:53:00,934
Abigail?

1066
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:03,805
Letitia?

1067
00:53:03,944 --> 00:53:05,275
Lena?

1068
00:53:05,991 --> 00:53:08,152
You might as well tell me.
I've got a lot more.

1069
00:53:08,264 --> 00:53:09,959
All right. You win.

1070
00:53:10,087 --> 00:53:11,111
It's Clarissa.

1071
00:53:11,592 --> 00:53:12,820
Clarissa.

1072
00:53:17,288 --> 00:53:19,256
All right, Saunders, let's go!

1073
00:53:21,096 --> 00:53:23,690
Now, Susan's an awfully
pretty name, isn't it?

1074
00:53:23,944 --> 00:53:26,936
Susan? Susan Paine?
Oh, it's beautiful.

1075
00:53:27,944 --> 00:53:29,411
She's a beautiful woman,
isn't she?

1076
00:53:29,672 --> 00:53:34,609
Isn't she a beautiful girl?
I think she's about the most beautiful--

1077
00:53:35,624 --> 00:53:38,559
We've got to get started on this,
or we'll never get it finished.

1078
00:53:38,631 --> 00:53:41,498
Get set, because I'm going to talk
much faster than you can write.

1079
00:53:41,576 --> 00:53:42,634
You ready?

1080
00:53:43,304 --> 00:53:46,432
The location of this camp.
About 200 acres...

1081
00:53:46,504 --> 00:53:48,699
...situated in Ambrose County,
Terry Canyon.

1082
00:53:48,808 --> 00:53:51,470
Running a quarter mile on
either side of Willet Creek.

1083
00:53:52,456 --> 00:53:53,286
What?

1084
00:53:53,448 --> 00:53:56,008
Willet Creek. W-l-L-L-E-T.
It's a little stream.

1085
00:53:56,104 --> 00:53:57,093
In Terry Canyon?

1086
00:53:57,256 --> 00:53:58,985
You don't know it, do you?

1087
00:54:00,776 --> 00:54:03,108
You've never been there, you said.

1088
00:54:03,272 --> 00:54:06,639
You've discussed this with
Senator Paine, haven't you?

1089
00:54:06,696 --> 00:54:07,628
No, no. Why?

1090
00:54:08,584 --> 00:54:10,449
Nothing. It doesn't matter.

1091
00:54:10,567 --> 00:54:13,161
There's no reason to
talk it over with him.

1092
00:54:13,288 --> 00:54:16,485
"A quarter of a mile on
either side of Willet Creek."

1093
00:54:16,552 --> 00:54:20,750
And the land to be bought by the
contribution of the boys...

1094
00:54:20,775 --> 00:54:24,142
...the money to be loaned to us by
the United States.

1095
00:54:25,736 --> 00:54:28,637
Excuse me. Pardon me.

1096
00:54:31,048 --> 00:54:33,209
What did you get me
out of bed for?

1097
00:54:33,320 --> 00:54:35,049
Sit tight.
The show's about to commence.

1098
00:54:35,175 --> 00:54:37,075
Mind telling me what's going on?

1099
00:54:37,191 --> 00:54:38,021
Certainly.

1100
00:54:38,184 --> 00:54:40,948
There's the principal
actor in our little play.

1101
00:54:41,031 --> 00:54:43,295
"Don Quixote" Smith, Man With Bill.

1102
00:54:43,815 --> 00:54:45,908
-Here, one of the supporting characters.
-Who?

1103
00:54:46,056 --> 00:54:48,354
That gorilla in man's clothing,
McGann.

1104
00:54:48,456 --> 00:54:49,980
You mean Puss-in-Boots?

1105
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:51,747
Mostly Puss.

1106
00:54:53,159 --> 00:54:56,526
Another prominent character in
our play, the Silver Knight.

1107
00:54:56,551 --> 00:54:58,041
Soul of honor on a tightrope.

1108
00:54:58,184 --> 00:55:00,652
You wouldn't be a little goofy,
would you?

1109
00:55:01,576 --> 00:55:04,704
Don Quixote will stand up in a
minute and speak two important words...

1110
00:55:04,776 --> 00:55:05,868
..."Willet Creek."

1111
00:55:06,024 --> 00:55:08,788
Then the Silver Knight
will fall off his tightrope...

1112
00:55:08,871 --> 00:55:11,533
...and "Puss" will jump
out of his boots.

1113
00:55:12,200 --> 00:55:13,724
It is so ordered.

1114
00:55:14,856 --> 00:55:16,289
Introduction of new bills...

1115
00:55:16,424 --> 00:55:17,982
...and joint resolutions.

1116
00:55:19,112 --> 00:55:19,942
Mr. President!

1117
00:55:28,808 --> 00:55:33,677
The chair recognizes the rather
strong-lunged junior senator...

1118
00:55:34,152 --> 00:55:35,141
...Mr. Smith.

1119
00:55:36,488 --> 00:55:37,978
I'm sorry.
I have a bill--

1120
00:55:38,120 --> 00:55:40,054
You may speak a little louder.

1121
00:55:40,168 --> 00:55:40,998
But not too loud.

1122
00:55:45,159 --> 00:55:46,683
I have a bill to propose.

1123
00:55:51,432 --> 00:55:52,956
Order, gentlemen.

1124
00:55:53,512 --> 00:55:56,811
Our junior senator
is about to make a speech.

1125
00:56:01,864 --> 00:56:02,796
You may proceed.

1126
00:56:09,544 --> 00:56:13,810
"Be it enacted by the Senate
and the House of Representatives...

1127
00:56:14,504 --> 00:56:16,995
...that there be appropriated
as a loan...

1128
00:56:17,384 --> 00:56:21,286
...a sum sufficient to create
a national boys' camp...

1129
00:56:21,352 --> 00:56:24,219
...to be paid back to the
U.S. Treasury...

1130
00:56:24,296 --> 00:56:26,958
...by contributions from
boys of America.

1131
00:56:27,720 --> 00:56:28,846
This camp...

1132
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:32,026
...to be situated on land at
and adjacent to...

1133
00:56:32,103 --> 00:56:34,833
...the headwaters of a stream
known as Willet Creek...

1134
00:56:34,919 --> 00:56:36,580
...in Terry Canyon...

1135
00:56:38,823 --> 00:56:42,987
...for the purpose of bringing together
boys of all walks of life...

1136
00:56:43,656 --> 00:56:46,523
...from various parts of the country.

1137
00:56:47,047 --> 00:56:50,346
Boys of all creeds, kinds
and positions.

1138
00:56:51,016 --> 00:56:55,783
To educate them in American ideals
and to promote mutual understanding.

1139
00:56:55,784 --> 00:56:57,945
To bring about a healthful life...

1140
00:56:58,056 --> 00:57:01,116
...to the youth of this
great and beautiful land."

1141
00:57:42,023 --> 00:57:45,515
Our senator will make a good orator
when his voice stops changing.

1142
00:57:48,456 --> 00:57:52,449
I'm getting leery of him. We call him
dumb, but he keeps getting in our hair.

1143
00:57:52,487 --> 00:57:56,583
When he finds out a dam is going up
where he wants his boys' camp...

1144
00:57:56,616 --> 00:57:58,880
...he's going to ask questions.

1145
00:57:58,984 --> 00:58:01,043
Be quiet. I'm trying to think.

1146
00:58:02,024 --> 00:58:04,390
This deficiency bill
will be read tomorrow.

1147
00:58:04,488 --> 00:58:05,318
Tomorrow?

1148
00:58:05,479 --> 00:58:08,971
He'll hear that section
on the Willet Dam. He can't be there.

1149
00:58:09,032 --> 00:58:12,934
I'll take him to see monuments, even if
I have to hit him on the head with one.

1150
00:58:12,968 --> 00:58:14,060
That won't work.

1151
00:58:14,215 --> 00:58:16,308
This boy's honest, not stupid.

1152
00:58:16,999 --> 00:58:17,988
Susan.

1153
00:58:19,175 --> 00:58:21,803
My daughter won't carry out
such assignments.

1154
00:58:39,144 --> 00:58:42,238
Senator!
If you let me handle your publicity--

1155
00:58:43,879 --> 00:58:45,813
Down, everybody!

1156
00:58:51,880 --> 00:58:53,142
Who are those people?

1157
00:58:53,383 --> 00:58:55,374
Phonies, office seekers, cranks.

1158
00:58:55,495 --> 00:58:57,224
"Get my son in or out of West Point--"

1159
00:58:57,351 --> 00:59:01,845
This machine creates a fever 1 0 miles
away. It'll make you a fortune.

1160
00:59:02,248 --> 00:59:03,806
Long-distance fevers.

1161
00:59:03,943 --> 00:59:06,741
A woman wrote a song to replace
"The Star-Spangled Banner."

1162
00:59:06,823 --> 00:59:08,381
-Want to hear it?
-Not today.

1163
00:59:08,519 --> 00:59:11,488
I feel like a house afire.
Even went to see Mr. Lincoln.

1164
00:59:11,592 --> 00:59:13,321
-How did I do?
-Great.

1165
00:59:13,448 --> 00:59:16,076
My heart was right up to here
all the time.

1166
00:59:16,167 --> 00:59:18,465
-What did Paine think?
-Tickled pink.

1167
00:59:18,568 --> 00:59:20,058
Oh, boy! I hope so.

1168
00:59:20,999 --> 00:59:24,127
-What's all this?
-From boys who read about your camp.

1169
00:59:24,199 --> 00:59:25,826
Already? All these letter--

1170
00:59:25,959 --> 00:59:29,019
Those are only local. Wait till they
start pouring in from all over.

1171
00:59:29,128 --> 00:59:33,428
You mean-- I'd better open one up.
Let's see what they say here.

1172
00:59:35,015 --> 00:59:37,711
Look, there's money.
Let me see.

1173
00:59:39,143 --> 00:59:40,633
"Dear Senator Smith...

1174
00:59:40,775 --> 00:59:44,006
...I'd like to come to camp.
I shine shoes at the station.

1175
00:59:44,072 --> 00:59:47,735
Here's 9 cents."
lsn't that wonderful?

1176
00:59:47,751 --> 00:59:51,482
And he signs it, "Yours truly,
Stinky Moore."

1177
00:59:51,527 --> 00:59:53,154
Isn't that marvelous?

1178
00:59:53,287 --> 00:59:57,621
If there's money in each one of these,
what will we do with it?

1179
00:59:57,991 --> 00:59:59,686
A bank! That's perfect.

1180
00:59:59,848 --> 01:00:04,080
You can see how important
this bill will be. Is there any paper?

1181
01:00:04,103 --> 01:00:05,627
Second drawer.

1182
01:00:05,831 --> 01:00:08,129
That's fine.
I'll be pretty busy tonight.

1183
01:00:08,647 --> 01:00:10,308
Not another bill?

1184
01:00:11,431 --> 01:00:13,899
Letters. I'm busting with news!

1185
01:00:13,992 --> 01:00:15,789
I introduced a bill.
Me, Jeff Smith!

1186
01:00:15,912 --> 01:00:17,402
I spoke in the Senate!

1187
01:00:17,543 --> 01:00:21,035
-Want to dictate them?
-The letters? I couldn't talk letters.

1188
01:00:21,095 --> 01:00:23,188
I'll sit here
and scratch them down.

1189
01:00:23,303 --> 01:00:24,133
And say...

1190
01:00:25,416 --> 01:00:27,714
...I'm going to tell Ma all about you.

1191
01:00:27,815 --> 01:00:32,650
And if I tell it right, you'll get the
best jar of preserves you ever tasted.

1192
01:00:32,680 --> 01:00:34,671
Thank you very much.

1193
01:00:36,039 --> 01:00:39,065
Gee whiz, I forgot to thank you.

1194
01:00:39,144 --> 01:00:40,509
Don't mention it.

1195
01:00:42,823 --> 01:00:45,451
Without you, I couldn't have, I mean....

1196
01:00:51,303 --> 01:00:52,167
Who?

1197
01:00:52,327 --> 01:00:53,385
Susan Paine.

1198
01:00:53,895 --> 01:00:56,955
How do you do?
Yes, I can talk. Go right ahead.

1199
01:00:57,032 --> 01:00:59,899
I'm sorry to bother you,
but you've got to help me.

1200
01:00:59,976 --> 01:01:03,104
I'm elected to snatch Mr. Smith
from the Senate tomorrow.

1201
01:01:07,240 --> 01:01:08,070
You're what?

1202
01:01:08,231 --> 01:01:11,928
I'm to turn my glamour on for him.
You sympathize, don't you?

1203
01:01:12,007 --> 01:01:13,099
Awkward, isn't it?

1204
01:01:13,256 --> 01:01:16,225
Take him out and buy him
a suit of clothes that fits...

1205
01:01:16,296 --> 01:01:18,491
...and a hat that he can hang on to.

1206
01:01:18,599 --> 01:01:21,693
And a manicure and a haircut
wouldn't do any harm.

1207
01:01:21,767 --> 01:01:25,362
As one woman to another,
I hate to ask you to do this, but....

1208
01:01:25,415 --> 01:01:27,349
As one woman to another, of course.

1209
01:01:27,495 --> 01:01:28,587
Thanks, and--

1210
01:01:28,743 --> 01:01:29,971
Just a minute.

1211
01:01:30,599 --> 01:01:32,032
Miss Paine.

1212
01:01:33,863 --> 01:01:35,330
Susan Paine?

1213
01:01:36,904 --> 01:01:38,428
She wants to talk to me?

1214
01:01:39,303 --> 01:01:40,702
What does she...?

1215
01:01:42,568 --> 01:01:44,058
Holy mackerel.

1216
01:01:47,239 --> 01:01:49,537
Hello, Miss Paine.
How are you?

1217
01:01:50,471 --> 01:01:51,301
Yes.

1218
01:01:52,583 --> 01:01:53,572
Fine.

1219
01:01:55,559 --> 01:01:56,389
What?

1220
01:02:00,359 --> 01:02:01,986
What? Escort you?

1221
01:02:06,983 --> 01:02:08,974
I'd be delighted.

1222
01:02:09,575 --> 01:02:10,906
All right.

1223
01:02:11,464 --> 01:02:12,829
Reception for a princess?

1224
01:02:13,351 --> 01:02:14,875
She wants me to--

1225
01:02:15,015 --> 01:02:16,380
Goodbye, Miss Paine.

1226
01:02:17,063 --> 01:02:18,257
Goodbye.

1227
01:02:18,407 --> 01:02:20,898
What do you know?
A reception for a princess.

1228
01:02:20,999 --> 01:02:23,194
-Can you imagine?
-Get your hat.

1229
01:02:23,303 --> 01:02:26,397
We have a lot of shopping to do
before tomorrow.

1230
01:02:27,847 --> 01:02:29,371
Where are your bitters?

1231
01:02:29,511 --> 01:02:32,344
In the thing there.
Behind the thing.

1232
01:02:32,584 --> 01:02:35,519
I don't mind who gets licked
in a fair fight.

1233
01:02:37,544 --> 01:02:40,308
It's these clouts below the belt
I can't take.

1234
01:02:40,551 --> 01:02:44,681
Siccing that horrible dame on him
when he's goofy about her.

1235
01:02:45,543 --> 01:02:46,373
What dame?

1236
01:02:46,599 --> 01:02:47,588
Paine.

1237
01:02:50,247 --> 01:02:51,612
Better be nice to her.

1238
01:02:51,751 --> 01:02:54,311
Her dad's the party choice
for the White House.

1239
01:02:54,407 --> 01:02:57,308
She may be the next
First Lady of the land.

1240
01:02:57,800 --> 01:03:01,566
Imagine reading "My Day"
by Susan "Paine-ln-The-Neck."

1241
01:03:02,248 --> 01:03:05,740
He isn't going to be hurt enough.
She has to twist a knife in him too.

1242
01:03:05,799 --> 01:03:07,426
The regal jackass.

1243
01:03:07,559 --> 01:03:09,754
"I'll turn my glamour on him,"
she says.

1244
01:03:09,863 --> 01:03:10,955
What's it to you?

1245
01:03:11,111 --> 01:03:12,874
Nothing. I'm just saying--

1246
01:03:12,999 --> 01:03:14,557
Then stop worrying.

1247
01:03:14,728 --> 01:03:17,390
I told you, the dopes
will inherit the earth.

1248
01:03:17,511 --> 01:03:22,005
I wonder if this Don Quixote
hasn't got the jump on all of us.

1249
01:03:22,119 --> 01:03:25,611
If it isn't a curse to go
through life wised up like you and me.

1250
01:03:25,671 --> 01:03:29,869
If you're going to wonder,
let's go down and do it over a steak.

1251
01:03:30,247 --> 01:03:32,807
Come on, snap out of it.
Drink up!

1252
01:03:32,903 --> 01:03:34,734
Here's to bigger and better dopes.

1253
01:03:35,655 --> 01:03:37,623
And to Don Quixote.

1254
01:03:38,855 --> 01:03:40,345
Do you know how I felt?

1255
01:03:40,487 --> 01:03:42,421
How did you feel? Quick.

1256
01:03:43,079 --> 01:03:45,104
I felt just like a mother.

1257
01:03:45,831 --> 01:03:49,460
Sending her kid off to school
for the first time.

1258
01:03:50,215 --> 01:03:55,084
Watching the little fellow
toddling off in his best bib and tucker.

1259
01:03:55,463 --> 01:03:58,364
Hoping he can stand up
to the other kids.

1260
01:04:03,047 --> 01:04:05,140
Say, who started this?

1261
01:04:06,791 --> 01:04:09,055
I'm just waiting for a streetcar.

1262
01:04:09,831 --> 01:04:11,594
Well, cut it out, see?

1263
01:04:13,032 --> 01:04:14,294
Who cares, anyway?

1264
01:04:15,591 --> 01:04:16,853
I apologize.

1265
01:04:16,999 --> 01:04:18,091
All right, then.

1266
01:04:20,071 --> 01:04:23,700
After all, what's it to me?
So they drop him out of a balloon.

1267
01:04:23,751 --> 01:04:26,185
All I care is,
I don't want to be around.

1268
01:04:26,279 --> 01:04:28,839
I'm squeamish, see?
That's what I am.

1269
01:04:30,824 --> 01:04:31,813
No, sir.

1270
01:04:32,391 --> 01:04:35,258
I don't have to take it.
I won't be party to murder.

1271
01:04:35,335 --> 01:04:37,269
I'm going to quit.
I'm through.

1272
01:04:37,383 --> 01:04:39,783
Again?
It's a good idea.

1273
01:04:51,815 --> 01:04:53,715
Let's get married.

1274
01:04:53,927 --> 01:04:55,656
It's a good idea.

1275
01:04:56,199 --> 01:04:57,166
When?

1276
01:04:57,319 --> 01:04:58,411
Anytime.

1277
01:04:59,175 --> 01:05:00,142
Tonight?

1278
01:05:01,511 --> 01:05:02,637
You don't mind?

1279
01:05:03,303 --> 01:05:04,736
I'd cherish you.

1280
01:05:07,463 --> 01:05:08,930
You're a good egg, Diz.

1281
01:05:09,063 --> 01:05:10,325
I know.

1282
01:05:11,111 --> 01:05:13,511
Maybe we could clear out of this town.

1283
01:05:13,607 --> 01:05:15,768
Get to feel like people.

1284
01:05:17,095 --> 01:05:19,791
Live like we just got out of a tunnel.

1285
01:05:20,359 --> 01:05:22,350
-Tunnel?
-A tunnel.

1286
01:05:24,135 --> 01:05:26,603
You've never seen prairie grass...

1287
01:05:26,695 --> 01:05:29,994
...with the wind leaning on it,
have you, Diz?

1288
01:05:30,087 --> 01:05:32,851
Does the wind get tired out there?

1289
01:05:34,759 --> 01:05:37,227
Or angry little mountain streams...

1290
01:05:38,279 --> 01:05:41,077
...or the sun moving
against the cattle?

1291
01:05:42,087 --> 01:05:45,454
You've never seen anything like that,
have you, Diz?

1292
01:05:46,183 --> 01:05:47,377
Have you?

1293
01:05:51,975 --> 01:05:53,169
Do we have to?

1294
01:05:55,175 --> 01:05:57,700
I can't think of anything more sappy.

1295
01:05:58,119 --> 01:05:59,552
Then let's get going.

1296
01:05:59,687 --> 01:06:00,676
Where?

1297
01:06:01,703 --> 01:06:03,102
We're getting married.

1298
01:06:03,239 --> 01:06:05,173
That's right.

1299
01:06:06,791 --> 01:06:10,921
In case you don't know, I want to
give you a chance to back out.

1300
01:06:10,951 --> 01:06:11,781
What?

1301
01:06:11,975 --> 01:06:13,806
My first name's Clarissa.

1302
01:06:13,927 --> 01:06:15,394
I know. It's okay.

1303
01:06:16,359 --> 01:06:19,590
Don't say "okay."
Say you think it's beautiful.

1304
01:06:19,655 --> 01:06:21,418
Okay. I mean--

1305
01:06:21,543 --> 01:06:25,479
You don't know any name offhand
that you like better, do you?

1306
01:06:25,511 --> 01:06:26,876
Not offhand.

1307
01:06:27,015 --> 01:06:29,245
Nothing like "Susan" or anything?

1308
01:06:29,351 --> 01:06:30,340
Susan?

1309
01:06:32,839 --> 01:06:34,397
I won't take it, see?

1310
01:06:34,727 --> 01:06:36,752
I won't be party to murder, see?

1311
01:06:36,871 --> 01:06:41,467
Steering a poor dope up blind alleys
for that Taylor mob is low enough...

1312
01:06:41,479 --> 01:06:44,141
...but helping that dame
cut him in little bits...

1313
01:06:44,231 --> 01:06:46,756
...nobody's going to make me do that!
No, sir.

1314
01:06:47,143 --> 01:06:48,075
You said it.

1315
01:06:48,231 --> 01:06:51,598
I'm going to get out of there right now.
Right now.

1316
01:06:51,655 --> 01:06:54,123
Bonus or no bonus. I'm clearing out.

1317
01:06:54,215 --> 01:06:57,207
Everything I own.
My extra hat, everything.

1318
01:06:57,831 --> 01:06:58,820
Wait a minute.

1319
01:06:58,983 --> 01:07:00,974
We're getting married!

1320
01:07:01,255 --> 01:07:02,483
See you later.

1321
01:07:09,063 --> 01:07:10,052
Saunders?

1322
01:07:17,863 --> 01:07:19,057
What do you want?

1323
01:07:19,207 --> 01:07:21,675
-You should have been there.
-I know.

1324
01:07:21,767 --> 01:07:24,702
It was a wonderful party, and
your suit went over big...

1325
01:07:24,775 --> 01:07:26,504
...and she looked beautiful.

1326
01:07:26,695 --> 01:07:28,390
And when you left she said...

1327
01:07:28,519 --> 01:07:30,180
..."Thank you, Mr. Smith."

1328
01:07:30,311 --> 01:07:34,577
But it was the way she said it.
You nearly fell through the floor.

1329
01:07:34,599 --> 01:07:35,793
Horseradish.

1330
01:07:44,295 --> 01:07:47,662
What are you looking at?
You didn't think I was a lady, did you?

1331
01:07:47,719 --> 01:07:49,516
A lady wouldn't work for this outfit.

1332
01:07:49,639 --> 01:07:52,267
Even I can't take it anymore. I quit.

1333
01:07:52,359 --> 01:07:54,350
There's a lot I can't take.

1334
01:07:54,471 --> 01:07:56,268
Can't take a simple--

1335
01:07:59,271 --> 01:08:01,330
Why don't you go home?

1336
01:08:01,543 --> 01:08:05,309
Tell your little streams about your camp
and the land of the free.

1337
01:08:05,351 --> 01:08:08,514
This is no place for you.
You're halfway decent.

1338
01:08:08,583 --> 01:08:09,777
Now go home!

1339
01:08:10,247 --> 01:08:12,613
That's all I wanted to tell you.

1340
01:08:13,383 --> 01:08:15,408
Meet the man I'm going to marry.

1341
01:08:17,959 --> 01:08:19,324
That's me.

1342
01:08:20,807 --> 01:08:23,708
Say something.
Don't just stand there like a--

1343
01:08:25,351 --> 01:08:26,682
Wait a minute.

1344
01:08:26,855 --> 01:08:29,050
Why don't I do this right?

1345
01:08:29,479 --> 01:08:32,937
So you want to be a senator?
Build a camp on Willet Creek?

1346
01:08:32,998 --> 01:08:33,896
See this?

1347
01:08:34,151 --> 01:08:35,516
Deficiency bill.

1348
01:08:35,655 --> 01:08:39,682
Section 40. A dam going up where you
think your camp will be.

1349
01:08:39,718 --> 01:08:41,913
Ever hear of it?

1350
01:08:42,023 --> 01:08:45,390
They read about it in the Senate today,
but you didn't hear.

1351
01:08:45,447 --> 01:08:47,938
That's why that ritzy dame
took you in tow.

1352
01:08:48,039 --> 01:08:52,305
That's why they sent you here.
You don't know a dam from a bathtub.

1353
01:08:52,327 --> 01:08:54,352
Go ahead.
Be a senator.

1354
01:08:54,470 --> 01:08:57,371
Try and mess up
Mr. Taylor's little graft.

1355
01:08:57,447 --> 01:08:59,005
But if you can't...

1356
01:08:59,143 --> 01:09:02,112
...and you can't in 9 million years--

1357
01:09:02,567 --> 01:09:06,628
Go home! Don't stay around here
making people feel sorry for you.

1358
01:09:07,847 --> 01:09:09,178
Come on, Diz.

1359
01:09:14,375 --> 01:09:15,933
Hey! This way.

1360
01:09:19,719 --> 01:09:23,086
Come on, kid.
We'll dig up a preacher.

1361
01:09:24,263 --> 01:09:26,026
We're going to get married.

1362
01:09:34,887 --> 01:09:37,287
Come on, I'll take you home.

1363
01:09:44,839 --> 01:09:45,479
There are 1 00 other places in the state
that really need the water.

1364
01:09:45,479 --> 01:09:48,573
There are 1 00 other places in the state
that really need the water.

1365
01:09:48,679 --> 01:09:52,706
Kenneth Allen owns some land there.
He didn't mention a dam.

1366
01:09:52,743 --> 01:09:55,871
There's something wrong here.
I know there is.

1367
01:09:55,943 --> 01:09:58,912
I won't vote on it till I get
some questions answered.

1368
01:09:58,983 --> 01:10:01,474
-Jeff, you're fighting windmills.
-I am?

1369
01:10:01,574 --> 01:10:04,975
Trying to understand everything about
a project that took two years to set up.

1370
01:10:05,031 --> 01:10:08,660
-The reasons, the benefits.
-The benefits? Who is Taylor?

1371
01:10:09,671 --> 01:10:11,070
What's he got to do with this?

1372
01:10:11,207 --> 01:10:14,005
What makes you think
he's got anything to do with it?

1373
01:10:14,150 --> 01:10:17,415
I've heard that this is all
his idea to get graft.

1374
01:10:19,814 --> 01:10:21,714
Do you know what you're saying?

1375
01:10:21,830 --> 01:10:25,630
You're accusing me of framing a bill
for one individual's benefit.

1376
01:10:25,670 --> 01:10:28,571
Of helping to put through
a scheme for graft.

1377
01:10:29,351 --> 01:10:30,545
Long distance?

1378
01:10:30,695 --> 01:10:32,925
Get me James Taylor, Jackson City.

1379
01:10:33,127 --> 01:10:35,618
Boy Ranger, eh? Answer to a prayer?
Manna from heaven.

1380
01:10:35,719 --> 01:10:37,516
Didn't even know how to tell time.

1381
01:10:37,639 --> 01:10:39,800
Will you tell me
exactly what he's done?

1382
01:10:39,911 --> 01:10:42,744
He's about to blow the machine
to smithereens, and you with it.

1383
01:10:42,823 --> 01:10:44,484
Me, Jim? How?

1384
01:10:44,615 --> 01:10:46,515
You wouldn't understand that.

1385
01:10:46,631 --> 01:10:49,862
Listen to me, Mr. Ten-Thumbs,
I'm on my way to Washington.

1386
01:10:49,926 --> 01:10:54,590
No matter what happens, I'm all ready
for that Boy Ranger of yours.

1387
01:10:54,599 --> 01:10:56,658
Take your instructions
from Ken Allen.

1388
01:10:56,775 --> 01:10:59,175
I wouldn't trust you to lick a stamp.

1389
01:10:59,270 --> 01:11:01,898
Use your high office to help Alan
get things done.

1390
01:11:01,991 --> 01:11:04,186
Do you understand?

1391
01:11:04,295 --> 01:11:05,728
I doubt it.
Come on, Alan.

1392
01:11:06,343 --> 01:11:10,575
I haven't been able to show him a single
monument. Not even one that high.

1393
01:11:10,598 --> 01:11:13,863
No, he's been on our tail.
You've got to keep this guy off of us.

1394
01:11:13,926 --> 01:11:17,828
Ever since he found out we represent
the Creek, he's been running us ragged.

1395
01:11:17,863 --> 01:11:21,355
I told you I'd handle him.
I object to you coming here like this.

1396
01:11:21,479 --> 01:11:23,106
You proved how you can handle him.

1397
01:11:23,239 --> 01:11:25,833
You're the one that started him
writing bills.

1398
01:11:26,406 --> 01:11:27,532
Chick, let him in.

1399
01:11:27,687 --> 01:11:31,623
-You didn't ask Smith here?
-What do you think?

1400
01:11:31,655 --> 01:11:34,453
Don't open that door.
Jim, you can't do this.

1401
01:11:35,910 --> 01:11:37,377
Let him in, Chick.

1402
01:11:37,639 --> 01:11:39,197
All right, Jim.

1403
01:11:39,335 --> 01:11:40,802
You can count me out.

1404
01:11:43,942 --> 01:11:46,240
Good morning, senator.
Come right in.

1405
01:11:52,391 --> 01:11:54,552
What did you mean, count you out?

1406
01:11:54,663 --> 01:11:57,530
You can't come here and
pull that steamroller stuff.

1407
01:11:57,607 --> 01:11:59,370
Your methods won't do here.

1408
01:11:59,495 --> 01:12:02,089
He's a senator.
However it happened, he's a senator.

1409
01:12:02,182 --> 01:12:03,376
This is Washington.

1410
01:12:03,527 --> 01:12:07,293
Steamroller stuff?
My methods don't go in Washington?

1411
01:12:07,334 --> 01:12:08,733
They've done well by you.

1412
01:12:08,871 --> 01:12:12,602
That's beside the point.
This boy's different. He's honest.

1413
01:12:12,646 --> 01:12:15,114
He thinks the world of me.
We can't do it!

1414
01:12:15,207 --> 01:12:18,973
What am I supposed to do? Stand around
and let that drooling infant...

1415
01:12:19,014 --> 01:12:22,643
...wrap that Willet Creek Dam
appropriation around my neck?

1416
01:12:22,694 --> 01:12:24,127
Not me.

1417
01:12:25,191 --> 01:12:27,591
Either he falls in line with us...

1418
01:12:27,687 --> 01:12:31,418
...or I'll break him so wide open
they'll never find the pieces.

1419
01:12:31,463 --> 01:12:34,193
Jim, I won't stand for it.

1420
01:12:34,279 --> 01:12:35,803
You won't stand for it?

1421
01:12:35,942 --> 01:12:39,036
I don't want any part
of crucifying this boy.

1422
01:12:40,263 --> 01:12:41,491
I see.

1423
01:12:41,990 --> 01:12:46,927
Our steamroller methods are too hard
for your sensitive soul. Is that it?

1424
01:12:47,654 --> 01:12:50,623
The Silver Knight
is getting too big for us.

1425
01:12:51,975 --> 01:12:54,910
My methods have been all right
for the past 20 years.

1426
01:12:54,982 --> 01:12:57,678
Since I picked you
out of a flyspecked hole-in-the-wall...

1427
01:12:57,766 --> 01:12:59,893
...and made you look like a senator.

1428
01:13:00,007 --> 01:13:01,838
And now you can't stand it?

1429
01:13:01,958 --> 01:13:04,392
Maybe you don't have to stand it.

1430
01:13:04,486 --> 01:13:07,683
Maybe we can fix it so you and the boy
can go home together.

1431
01:13:07,751 --> 01:13:11,551
-You don't have to--
-It's all right, it's all right.

1432
01:13:12,679 --> 01:13:16,809
Seems a shame, though, to part company
like this after all these years.

1433
01:13:16,839 --> 01:13:20,798
Especially now, with a national
convention coming up.

1434
01:13:21,991 --> 01:13:24,721
Joe, I put everything I have
behind you.

1435
01:13:24,807 --> 01:13:26,900
And so did all of our friends.

1436
01:13:28,007 --> 01:13:29,634
I guess we'll survive.

1437
01:13:29,927 --> 01:13:33,522
We'll just find somebody else
who's got a little more sense.

1438
01:13:33,575 --> 01:13:38,308
In the meantime, you go in and
explain to Mr. Smith about Willet Dam.

1439
01:13:38,311 --> 01:13:40,711
It's your bill. It's your reputation.

1440
01:13:40,806 --> 01:13:43,366
If he can't find enough facts
to break you with...

1441
01:13:43,463 --> 01:13:46,523
...send him to me.
I'll give him a couple of good ones.

1442
01:13:46,759 --> 01:13:50,195
I'm taking the next plane home.
So long.

1443
01:13:57,286 --> 01:13:58,685
Come here, will you?

1444
01:14:07,975 --> 01:14:10,136
It's just that I like the kid.

1445
01:14:10,855 --> 01:14:13,187
I don't want to see you
get too rough on him.

1446
01:14:14,662 --> 01:14:16,789
I'm glad you came to your senses.

1447
01:14:16,903 --> 01:14:19,428
You had me scared there for a minute.

1448
01:14:19,526 --> 01:14:23,223
Go back to your office. I'll call you
when I get through with Smith.

1449
01:14:35,463 --> 01:14:37,624
"The Silver Knight."

1450
01:14:43,558 --> 01:14:44,388
Hello, senator.

1451
01:14:44,551 --> 01:14:47,816
I was just passing through.
I thought I'd like to meet you.

1452
01:14:47,879 --> 01:14:50,279
Sit down. You met all
the boys here, I suppose.

1453
01:14:50,375 --> 01:14:53,105
They say you've been
on your toes since you got here.

1454
01:14:53,191 --> 01:14:54,681
That's fine.

1455
01:14:55,398 --> 01:14:58,526
You know, some people told me
that you were dumb.

1456
01:14:58,599 --> 01:15:00,089
I think you're smart.

1457
01:15:00,230 --> 01:15:02,664
You're smart enough
to understand a situation...

1458
01:15:02,758 --> 01:15:04,851
-...when it's explained to you.
-Like what?

1459
01:15:04,967 --> 01:15:06,730
Well, for instance...

1460
01:15:06,854 --> 01:15:08,549
...building a dam on Willet Creek.

1461
01:15:08,678 --> 01:15:10,703
Just what's your interest in this?

1462
01:15:10,823 --> 01:15:12,222
What's my interest?

1463
01:15:14,119 --> 01:15:17,316
Anything that benefits the state
is mighty important to me.

1464
01:15:17,382 --> 01:15:20,874
Owning a lot of its industry,
newspapers and other odds and ends.

1465
01:15:20,935 --> 01:15:24,769
If I felt you had the welfare
of the state at heart like I have...

1466
01:15:24,806 --> 01:15:27,468
...I'd say you were a man to watch.

1467
01:15:28,294 --> 01:15:29,693
Now, what do you like?

1468
01:15:30,054 --> 01:15:30,986
Business?

1469
01:15:31,143 --> 01:15:33,202
If you do, you can pick any job...

1470
01:15:33,319 --> 01:15:35,014
...in the state and go to the top.

1471
01:15:35,206 --> 01:15:36,434
Or politics.

1472
01:15:37,126 --> 01:15:41,119
If you like being senator, there's
no reason why you can't come back...

1473
01:15:41,158 --> 01:15:43,217
...and stay there
as long as you want.

1474
01:15:43,334 --> 01:15:45,199
If you're smart.

1475
01:15:45,318 --> 01:15:47,616
Now, you take the boys here,
or Joe Paine.

1476
01:15:47,719 --> 01:15:49,311
They're doing all right.

1477
01:15:49,446 --> 01:15:51,175
They don't have to worry about...

1478
01:15:51,303 --> 01:15:53,396
...being re-elected or anything else.

1479
01:15:53,510 --> 01:15:54,374
They're smart.

1480
01:15:54,598 --> 01:15:56,429
They take my advice.

1481
01:15:57,767 --> 01:16:00,429
You tell these men
and Senator Paine what to do?

1482
01:16:00,518 --> 01:16:01,576
Why, yes.

1483
01:16:01,767 --> 01:16:04,998
Joe Paine has been taking my advice
for the past 20 years.

1484
01:16:07,175 --> 01:16:08,642
You're a liar.

1485
01:16:17,575 --> 01:16:19,372
I've got to see Senator Paine.

1486
01:16:19,495 --> 01:16:21,190
Senator Paine is out of town.

1487
01:16:21,319 --> 01:16:23,310
Out of town?
He couldn't be.

1488
01:16:27,238 --> 01:16:28,865
Hello, Jeff.
Come in.

1489
01:16:30,470 --> 01:16:32,233
Did you have a talk with Taylor?

1490
01:16:32,743 --> 01:16:34,836
He said he's told you
what to do for 20 years.

1491
01:16:34,951 --> 01:16:36,816
I called him a liar.

1492
01:16:37,543 --> 01:16:39,408
Come over here and sit down.

1493
01:16:39,526 --> 01:16:41,585
I don't feel like sitting down.

1494
01:16:41,862 --> 01:16:43,796
Oh, I know how you feel.

1495
01:16:45,159 --> 01:16:47,627
I was hoping you'd be
spared all this.

1496
01:16:48,166 --> 01:16:49,997
I was hoping that you would...

1497
01:16:50,119 --> 01:16:53,350
...see the sights, absorb some history,
and go back to your boys.

1498
01:16:53,414 --> 01:16:56,975
You've been living in a boy's world.
For heaven's sake, stay there.

1499
01:16:57,031 --> 01:16:58,157
This is a man's world.

1500
01:16:58,310 --> 01:17:00,107
It's brutal,
and you've no place in it.

1501
01:17:00,230 --> 01:17:03,996
You'll only get hurt. Take my advice.
Forget Taylor and what he said.

1502
01:17:04,038 --> 01:17:05,938
Forget you ever heard
of Willet Creek Dam.

1503
01:17:06,054 --> 01:17:08,249
But you still haven't
answered me, sir.

1504
01:17:08,359 --> 01:17:12,557
Can a man like Taylor tell you
and those other men what to do?

1505
01:17:13,926 --> 01:17:16,019
Listen, Jeff, please...

1506
01:17:16,518 --> 01:17:18,179
...and try to understand.

1507
01:17:18,342 --> 01:17:21,140
I know it's tough to run
head-on into facts.

1508
01:17:21,222 --> 01:17:24,589
This is a man's world,
and you got to check your ideals...

1509
01:17:24,646 --> 01:17:27,240
...outside the door,
like you do your rubbers.

1510
01:17:27,399 --> 01:17:31,062
Now, 30 years ago I had your ideals.

1511
01:17:31,847 --> 01:17:33,144
I was you.

1512
01:17:33,446 --> 01:17:37,041
I had to make the same decision
you were asked to make today.

1513
01:17:37,094 --> 01:17:38,391
And I made it.

1514
01:17:39,398 --> 01:17:40,865
I compromised.

1515
01:17:41,926 --> 01:17:46,761
So I could sit in that Senate and
serve the people in 1 000 honest ways.

1516
01:17:47,111 --> 01:17:48,806
You got to face facts.

1517
01:17:49,127 --> 01:17:51,118
I've served our state well,
haven't l?

1518
01:17:51,238 --> 01:17:54,833
We have the lowest unemployment
and the highest federal grants.

1519
01:17:55,334 --> 01:17:57,029
But I've had to compromise.

1520
01:17:57,159 --> 01:17:59,889
I've had to play ball.
You can't count on people voting.

1521
01:17:59,974 --> 01:18:02,272
Half the time
they don't vote, anyway.

1522
01:18:02,375 --> 01:18:06,243
That's how states and empires have been
built since time began, understand?

1523
01:18:12,327 --> 01:18:15,353
You can take my word for it.
That's how things are.

1524
01:18:18,439 --> 01:18:20,532
I've told you all this because...

1525
01:18:21,319 --> 01:18:23,514
...I've grown very fond of you.

1526
01:18:24,039 --> 01:18:26,337
About like a son, in fact.

1527
01:18:27,175 --> 01:18:29,666
And I don't want to
see you get hurt.

1528
01:18:30,534 --> 01:18:35,398
When that deficiency bill comes up
tomorrow, don't say a word.

1529
01:18:35,398 --> 01:18:38,663
Great powers are behind it,
who'll destroy you before you start.

1530
01:18:38,726 --> 01:18:40,216
For your own sake...

1531
01:18:40,646 --> 01:18:43,638
...and for the sake of
my friendship with your father...

1532
01:18:43,718 --> 01:18:44,776
...please...

1533
01:18:45,767 --> 01:18:47,758
...don't say a word.

1534
01:18:54,854 --> 01:18:57,448
Owing to the urgency
of the deficiency bill...

1535
01:18:57,543 --> 01:18:59,602
...there is a unanimous
consent agreement...

1536
01:18:59,719 --> 01:19:03,086
...that no one will speak more than once
or longer than five minutes...

1537
01:19:03,142 --> 01:19:05,372
...on any section of the bill.

1538
01:19:05,798 --> 01:19:06,924
Clerk will read.

1539
01:19:08,230 --> 01:19:12,462
"The bill for deficiency appropriations
for the fiscal year, Section One.

1540
01:19:12,486 --> 01:19:13,748
On emergency relief:

1541
01:19:13,894 --> 01:19:16,863
To create and erect
public improvements on rivers...

1542
01:19:16,934 --> 01:19:18,925
...harbors and roadways,
$1 50 billion.

1543
01:19:19,527 --> 01:19:20,425
Section 40:

1544
01:19:20,583 --> 01:19:23,575
An appropriation to divert
and impound Willet Creek...

1545
01:19:23,654 --> 01:19:26,316
...to the natural basin
of Terry Canyon, $5 million."

1546
01:19:26,406 --> 01:19:27,236
Mr. President?

1547
01:19:28,006 --> 01:19:30,702
Senator Smith desires
to be heard on Section 40?

1548
01:19:30,791 --> 01:19:31,723
I do, sir.

1549
01:19:31,974 --> 01:19:34,636
The senator understands
he's limited to five minutes?

1550
01:19:34,726 --> 01:19:35,658
Yes, sir.

1551
01:19:36,326 --> 01:19:37,691
You may proceed, sir.

1552
01:19:38,790 --> 01:19:42,226
Mr. President, this section of the bill,
this dam on Willet Creek...

1553
01:19:42,278 --> 01:19:43,677
...is nothing but--

1554
01:19:44,102 --> 01:19:47,071
Does Senator Smith wish to
yield to his colleague?

1555
01:19:48,358 --> 01:19:49,188
Why, yes, sir.

1556
01:19:49,350 --> 01:19:50,874
You may proceed, senator.

1557
01:19:51,014 --> 01:19:52,140
Mr. President...

1558
01:19:52,550 --> 01:19:54,848
...I have risen to a difficult task...

1559
01:19:54,950 --> 01:19:57,783
...to say from evidence
that has come to my attention...

1560
01:19:57,862 --> 01:20:00,763
...I consider Senator Smith
unworthy to address this body.

1561
01:20:02,630 --> 01:20:04,723
You boys go out
and get the senators.

1562
01:20:06,663 --> 01:20:09,029
Something going on inside,
come on.

1563
01:20:12,679 --> 01:20:15,876
The senator will suspend
until order is restored.

1564
01:20:16,294 --> 01:20:18,888
All senators are
wanted on the floor, please.

1565
01:20:23,910 --> 01:20:25,969
-What's going on?
-I don't know.

1566
01:20:37,830 --> 01:20:39,024
You may proceed.

1567
01:20:39,174 --> 01:20:40,402
I refer to the bill...

1568
01:20:40,550 --> 01:20:44,384
...he has introduced for
the creation of a national boys' camp.

1569
01:20:44,422 --> 01:20:47,482
He named a portion of land
to be dedicated to that purpose...

1570
01:20:47,591 --> 01:20:51,618
...and to be bought by contributions
from boys all over America.

1571
01:20:51,687 --> 01:20:52,745
Senators...

1572
01:20:53,382 --> 01:20:58,012
...I have evidence to prove my colleague
owns the land described in his bill.

1573
01:21:02,470 --> 01:21:05,439
He bought it the day after his
appointment to the Senate...

1574
01:21:05,510 --> 01:21:06,374
...and is holding it...

1575
01:21:06,534 --> 01:21:09,970
...using his privileged office
for his own personal profit!

1576
01:21:15,878 --> 01:21:17,573
Boy Ranger had a wreck.

1577
01:21:17,702 --> 01:21:19,192
This doesn't make sense.

1578
01:21:21,030 --> 01:21:22,054
Accordingly...

1579
01:21:22,694 --> 01:21:24,059
...I offer a resolution...

1580
01:21:24,198 --> 01:21:27,361
...an inquiry by the Committee
of Privileges and Elections...

1581
01:21:27,430 --> 01:21:28,897
...as to the fitness
of my colleague...

1582
01:21:29,030 --> 01:21:30,930
...to continue to
sit in this chamber.

1583
01:21:37,478 --> 01:21:38,445
Order!

1584
01:21:39,174 --> 01:21:42,268
Chairman, clear the galleries
unless order is restored.

1585
01:21:46,566 --> 01:21:49,228
Flash! Ranger senator
branded by colleague.

1586
01:21:49,318 --> 01:21:51,650
Flash! Paine brings charges
to expel Smith.

1587
01:21:51,750 --> 01:21:53,843
-Where's Saunders?
-She'll have the lowdown.

1588
01:21:53,958 --> 01:21:56,791
I wish I knew. She left town
in that jalopy of hers.

1589
01:21:57,478 --> 01:22:01,642
Paine accuses Smith of introducing
a boys' camp built for his own profit.

1590
01:22:01,670 --> 01:22:02,500
Give me a cigarette.

1591
01:22:02,662 --> 01:22:05,460
Paine's asked for a hearing
before the Committee.

1592
01:22:08,166 --> 01:22:10,327
Well, frankly, my dear senators...

1593
01:22:10,438 --> 01:22:13,305
...the morning that Mr. Allen
burst into my office...

1594
01:22:13,382 --> 01:22:17,113
...bringing proof that Smith
had the deed to that campsite...

1595
01:22:17,158 --> 01:22:18,386
...I was dumbfounded!

1596
01:22:18,534 --> 01:22:22,231
Pardon me, what did you do when
this was brought to your attention?

1597
01:22:22,278 --> 01:22:25,145
I consulted with the head
of the Department of Records...

1598
01:22:25,222 --> 01:22:26,655
...Mr. Arthur Kim.

1599
01:22:26,983 --> 01:22:29,884
Mr. Kim, do you remember
recording such a deed?

1600
01:22:31,174 --> 01:22:34,234
On the date set forth here,
Mr. Allen came before me...

1601
01:22:34,310 --> 01:22:35,675
...to record this deed...

1602
01:22:35,814 --> 01:22:38,908
...setting over 200 acres
in the name of Jefferson Smith.

1603
01:22:39,142 --> 01:22:42,009
How long have you known
Senator Smith, Mr. Allen?

1604
01:22:42,086 --> 01:22:43,849
Oh, a good many years.

1605
01:22:44,006 --> 01:22:48,238
He used my land by Willet Creek
every summer for his Boy Rangers.

1606
01:22:48,262 --> 01:22:49,854
Seemed like a mighty nice fellow.

1607
01:22:49,990 --> 01:22:51,514
One day he made a proposition.

1608
01:22:51,686 --> 01:22:55,087
Said he had a chance to sell that land
for at least $500 an acre.

1609
01:22:55,142 --> 01:22:58,669
I'd be glad to get 25 for it.
So we set it up like this:

1610
01:22:58,726 --> 01:23:01,490
I deeded him the land, and he gave me a
contract...

1611
01:23:01,574 --> 01:23:04,168
...guaranteeing me half,
if he made the sale.

1612
01:23:04,262 --> 01:23:05,490
Mind you now...

1613
01:23:05,638 --> 01:23:07,731
...the whole thing
sounded fishy at the time.

1614
01:23:07,846 --> 01:23:10,178
That contract you mentioned...

1615
01:23:10,278 --> 01:23:11,210
...have you got it?

1616
01:23:11,366 --> 01:23:13,800
That land wouldn't be
in his name if I didn't.

1617
01:23:13,894 --> 01:23:15,885
Yes, sir.
Signed and delivered.

1618
01:23:16,006 --> 01:23:17,997
I never signed any such contract!

1619
01:23:18,118 --> 01:23:19,142
He certainly did!

1620
01:23:19,302 --> 01:23:20,769
Just a moment, please.

1621
01:23:24,038 --> 01:23:28,634
After a long study of this signature,
it is my professional opinion...

1622
01:23:28,646 --> 01:23:32,343
...that it is definitely in
Jefferson Smith's own handwriting.

1623
01:23:32,390 --> 01:23:34,290
As an expert on handwriting...

1624
01:23:34,406 --> 01:23:38,843
...I'd say the name of Jefferson
Smith on this contract has been forged.

1625
01:23:38,854 --> 01:23:42,756
I would stake my whole 20 years
professional career...

1626
01:23:42,790 --> 01:23:46,021
...on the fact that
this is not a forgery...

1627
01:23:46,086 --> 01:23:49,715
...but is Mr. Smith's own signature.

1628
01:23:49,798 --> 01:23:51,993
This is a very painful
duty for me.

1629
01:23:52,102 --> 01:23:54,127
This boy's the son
of my very best friend.

1630
01:23:54,246 --> 01:23:57,181
I sponsored him in the Senate.
I helped frame his bill.

1631
01:23:57,254 --> 01:23:59,848
When he presented it,
I went to congratulate him...

1632
01:23:59,942 --> 01:24:02,342
...but pointed out
a dam was already going up...

1633
01:24:02,438 --> 01:24:04,963
...on the very site
he'd chosen for his camp.

1634
01:24:05,062 --> 01:24:07,656
There are other
good campsites nearby...

1635
01:24:07,750 --> 01:24:09,684
...so I suggested he choose another.

1636
01:24:09,894 --> 01:24:11,156
He became furious.

1637
01:24:11,302 --> 01:24:13,031
He said, "Move the dam."

1638
01:24:13,158 --> 01:24:16,150
I was amazed at his violent reaction.
I couldn't understand.

1639
01:24:16,230 --> 01:24:20,257
Until the evidence came to me that
he owned those very 200 acres.

1640
01:24:20,294 --> 01:24:21,318
And as you have heard...

1641
01:24:21,478 --> 01:24:24,709
...had carefully laid plans
to make an enormous profit...

1642
01:24:24,806 --> 01:24:29,675
...out of the nickels and dimes scraped
together by the boys of this country.

1643
01:24:29,766 --> 01:24:30,926
Faced with that...

1644
01:24:31,942 --> 01:24:34,740
...regardless of my
personal feelings for the boy...

1645
01:24:34,822 --> 01:24:38,451
...my sense of duty told me his
expulsion from the Senate...

1646
01:24:38,502 --> 01:24:40,333
...was the only possible answer.

1647
01:24:40,454 --> 01:24:42,479
Beautiful, that Taylor machine.

1648
01:24:46,630 --> 01:24:48,291
Senator Smith, please.

1649
01:24:52,166 --> 01:24:53,656
Will you take the chair, please?

1650
01:25:04,806 --> 01:25:08,298
The Committee is ready
to hear you now, Senator Smith.

1651
01:25:15,942 --> 01:25:17,500
Keep your seats, gentlemen!

1652
01:25:17,670 --> 01:25:19,661
Committee is not adjourned yet.

1653
01:25:19,782 --> 01:25:21,647
Quiet! Please!

1654
01:25:24,614 --> 01:25:28,812
That Ranger never knew what struck
him when Jim Taylor opened up on him.

1655
01:25:28,838 --> 01:25:30,897
Which one of you girls wants this?

1656
01:25:34,118 --> 01:25:36,109
-Do you want it?
-Oh, yes.

1657
01:27:12,357 --> 01:27:14,848
You know, I had a hunch
I'd find you here...

1658
01:27:14,950 --> 01:27:16,474
...when you weren't anyplace else.

1659
01:27:20,358 --> 01:27:21,655
How've you been, Saunders?

1660
01:27:21,798 --> 01:27:22,992
Oh, all right.

1661
01:27:24,006 --> 01:27:25,667
Your husband.
How's he?

1662
01:27:27,334 --> 01:27:29,302
Old Diz.
We're not married.

1663
01:27:33,766 --> 01:27:38,203
Good thing I got back just when I did.
You know what I found waiting for me?

1664
01:27:38,694 --> 01:27:40,628
Jar of preserves from your mother.

1665
01:27:40,742 --> 01:27:41,800
Oh, you did?

1666
01:27:43,302 --> 01:27:44,860
What was it, strawberry?

1667
01:27:46,117 --> 01:27:47,744
That's the best kind.

1668
01:27:49,957 --> 01:27:52,926
I see by the papers
you certainly got to be a senator.

1669
01:27:54,694 --> 01:27:57,492
You sure had the right idea
about me, Saunders.

1670
01:27:57,574 --> 01:28:01,635
You told me to go back home and
keep filling those kids full of hooey.

1671
01:28:03,045 --> 01:28:06,378
Just a simple guy, you said,
still wet behind the ears...

1672
01:28:06,438 --> 01:28:08,668
...Iot of junk about American ideals.

1673
01:28:09,126 --> 01:28:11,822
That's certainly
a lot of junk, all right.

1674
01:28:11,910 --> 01:28:14,811
-Now look, senator--
-I don't know...

1675
01:28:15,078 --> 01:28:17,342
...this is a whole new world to me.

1676
01:28:19,461 --> 01:28:21,292
What are you going to believe in...

1677
01:28:22,245 --> 01:28:25,737
...when a man like Senator Joseph Paine
gets up and swears...

1678
01:28:25,798 --> 01:28:29,256
...that I've been robbing
kids of nickels and dimes?

1679
01:28:30,054 --> 01:28:33,080
A man I've admired
and worshiped all my life.

1680
01:28:33,157 --> 01:28:34,385
I don't know.

1681
01:28:34,982 --> 01:28:36,609
A lot of fancy words in this town.

1682
01:28:36,741 --> 01:28:39,539
Some of them are carved in stone,
some of them....

1683
01:28:39,621 --> 01:28:43,887
Guess the Taylors and Paines put them up
there so suckers like me can read them.

1684
01:28:44,358 --> 01:28:47,122
Then when you find out
what men actually do....

1685
01:28:47,526 --> 01:28:50,086
Well, I'm getting out
of this town so fast...

1686
01:28:50,181 --> 01:28:54,049
...away from all the words and the
monuments and the whole rotten show.

1687
01:28:54,790 --> 01:28:55,916
I see.

1688
01:28:57,222 --> 01:28:59,747
When you get home,
what will you tell those kids?

1689
01:29:00,102 --> 01:29:02,070
Well, I'll tell them the truth.

1690
01:29:02,182 --> 01:29:04,707
Might as well find it out
now as later.

1691
01:29:05,893 --> 01:29:08,123
I don't think they'll believe you.

1692
01:29:08,710 --> 01:29:12,168
They're liable to look up at you
with hurt faces and say...

1693
01:29:12,230 --> 01:29:14,494
..."Jeff, what did you do? Quit?

1694
01:29:14,598 --> 01:29:16,293
Didn't you do something about it?"

1695
01:29:16,742 --> 01:29:19,006
Well, what do you expect me to do?

1696
01:29:19,685 --> 01:29:21,619
An honorary stooge
like me against...

1697
01:29:21,734 --> 01:29:25,397
...the Taylors and Paines
and machines and lies.

1698
01:29:25,638 --> 01:29:28,573
Your friend Mr. Lincoln
had his Taylors and Paines.

1699
01:29:28,646 --> 01:29:32,514
So did every other man who tried
to lift his thought up off the ground.

1700
01:29:32,550 --> 01:29:36,077
Odds against them didn't stop them,
they were fools that way.

1701
01:29:36,134 --> 01:29:38,261
All the good that ever came
into this world...

1702
01:29:38,374 --> 01:29:41,138
...came from fools with faith
like that. You know that.

1703
01:29:41,573 --> 01:29:44,736
You can't quit now. Not you.

1704
01:29:44,934 --> 01:29:47,198
They aren't all Taylors and Paines
in Washington.

1705
01:29:47,302 --> 01:29:50,430
That kind just throw big shadows,
that's all.

1706
01:29:50,790 --> 01:29:54,419
You didn't just have faith in Paine,
or any other living man.

1707
01:29:54,470 --> 01:29:56,597
You had faith in something bigger.

1708
01:29:56,710 --> 01:30:00,544
You had plain, decent,
everyday common rightness...

1709
01:30:00,582 --> 01:30:03,415
...and this country
could use some of that.

1710
01:30:04,038 --> 01:30:07,530
So could the whole cockeyed world.
A lot of it.

1711
01:30:08,326 --> 01:30:10,123
Remember the first day
you got here?

1712
01:30:10,246 --> 01:30:11,975
Remember what you said
about Mr. Lincoln?

1713
01:30:12,102 --> 01:30:15,071
That he was waiting for
someone to come along?

1714
01:30:15,142 --> 01:30:16,074
You were right.

1715
01:30:16,229 --> 01:30:20,632
He was waiting for a man who could
see his job and sail into it.

1716
01:30:20,646 --> 01:30:24,309
Who could tear into the Taylors
and root them out into the open.

1717
01:30:24,357 --> 01:30:26,587
I think he was waiting for you.

1718
01:30:26,726 --> 01:30:29,126
He knows you can do it.
So do l.

1719
01:30:29,606 --> 01:30:31,471
What?
Do what, Saunders?

1720
01:30:31,589 --> 01:30:34,888
You make up your mind you won't quit,
and I'll tell you what.

1721
01:30:34,950 --> 01:30:37,316
Been thinking about it
all the way back here.

1722
01:30:37,414 --> 01:30:41,748
It's a 40-foot dive into a tub of water,
but I think you can do it.

1723
01:30:48,582 --> 01:30:49,412
Clarissa...

1724
01:30:50,533 --> 01:30:51,932
...where can we get a drink?

1725
01:30:52,070 --> 01:30:53,059
Now you're talking.

1726
01:30:53,286 --> 01:30:55,151
Come on over to my place.

1727
01:31:07,205 --> 01:31:08,502
Mr. Dearborn.

1728
01:31:08,837 --> 01:31:10,168
Mr. Dernell.

1729
01:31:10,501 --> 01:31:11,866
Mr. Dwight.

1730
01:31:12,390 --> 01:31:14,290
They're going to
expel Smith today, eh?

1731
01:31:14,406 --> 01:31:16,772
Where are the drums?
Where's the guillotine?

1732
01:31:16,869 --> 01:31:17,961
In fact, where's Smith?

1733
01:31:18,117 --> 01:31:20,711
Hasn't stopped running
since he left the Committee.

1734
01:31:20,805 --> 01:31:21,863
-Mr. Singleton.
-Here.

1735
01:31:22,021 --> 01:31:22,851
Mr. Smith.

1736
01:31:23,014 --> 01:31:24,038
Here!

1737
01:31:32,421 --> 01:31:33,615
That guy's batty.

1738
01:31:33,766 --> 01:31:36,234
The clerk will continue
with the roll call.

1739
01:31:38,470 --> 01:31:39,767
Here comes Saunders.

1740
01:31:46,086 --> 01:31:47,951
Is this some of your shenanigan?

1741
01:31:48,614 --> 01:31:49,444
What's the matter?

1742
01:31:49,605 --> 01:31:51,266
Pray, Diz,
if you know how.

1743
01:31:51,590 --> 01:31:54,923
Did you have anything to do with
bringing him in here?

1744
01:31:55,046 --> 01:31:56,536
Are you crazy?

1745
01:31:58,693 --> 01:32:01,491
Ninety senators have answered
to their names.

1746
01:32:01,573 --> 01:32:02,801
Quorum is present.

1747
01:32:03,270 --> 01:32:05,101
Proceeding now to the regular order.

1748
01:32:16,677 --> 01:32:17,609
Mr. President.

1749
01:32:17,830 --> 01:32:19,388
Senator MacPherson.

1750
01:32:19,525 --> 01:32:23,120
I desire to call up the report
of the Committee...

1751
01:32:23,174 --> 01:32:26,166
...on the expulsion
of Jefferson Smith.

1752
01:32:29,157 --> 01:32:30,886
Clerk will read the report.

1753
01:32:31,685 --> 01:32:33,653
"The Committee on Privileges
and Elections reports...

1754
01:32:33,765 --> 01:32:36,325
...it appears to the satisfaction
of the Committee...

1755
01:32:36,422 --> 01:32:38,413
...after hearing
a number of witnesses...

1756
01:32:38,534 --> 01:32:40,764
...that justice
requires that Smith...

1757
01:32:40,870 --> 01:32:43,031
...no longer continue
a member of this body.

1758
01:32:43,494 --> 01:32:47,157
They report this resolution with
recommendation that the same do pass.

1759
01:32:47,269 --> 01:32:51,501
Resolved: That Jefferson Smith be
expelled from his seat in the Senate."

1760
01:32:58,117 --> 01:33:01,245
I move for the immediate
adoption of the resolution.

1761
01:33:02,277 --> 01:33:04,438
-I addressed the chair first.
-I have the floor.

1762
01:33:04,549 --> 01:33:06,483
I'm asking for
a roll call on the passage...

1763
01:33:06,597 --> 01:33:08,428
...of the resolution
without further delay.

1764
01:33:08,550 --> 01:33:11,417
The senator can have
nothing to say that would not--

1765
01:33:12,837 --> 01:33:16,102
However, Senator Smith
is still a member of this body...

1766
01:33:16,165 --> 01:33:19,396
...and has an equal claim
on the attention of this chair.

1767
01:33:19,462 --> 01:33:20,759
You were about to recognize me.

1768
01:33:20,901 --> 01:33:22,698
That was merely your impression.

1769
01:33:22,821 --> 01:33:24,152
Let him speak!

1770
01:33:28,837 --> 01:33:30,702
Before proceeding further...

1771
01:33:30,821 --> 01:33:35,087
...I remind the visitors in the gallery
they are here as our guests...

1772
01:33:35,109 --> 01:33:36,940
...and should conduct
themselves as such.

1773
01:33:37,029 --> 01:33:40,089
And I might add that their sentiments
in no way will affect...

1774
01:33:40,165 --> 01:33:42,429
...the judgement of this chair.

1775
01:33:47,814 --> 01:33:49,441
The chair recognizes...

1776
01:33:51,365 --> 01:33:52,696
...Senator Smith.

1777
01:33:55,302 --> 01:33:56,234
Thank you, sir.

1778
01:33:56,389 --> 01:33:57,651
Diz, here we go.

1779
01:33:58,149 --> 01:34:01,983
I guess the gentlemen are
in a big hurry to get me out of here.

1780
01:34:02,405 --> 01:34:05,431
The way the evidence is piled up
against me, I can't blame them much.

1781
01:34:05,509 --> 01:34:08,478
And I'm willing to go
when they vote it that way...

1782
01:34:08,549 --> 01:34:11,541
...but before that happens,
I've got a few things to say.

1783
01:34:11,589 --> 01:34:14,717
I tried to say them once before and l
got stopped colder than a mackerel.

1784
01:34:14,790 --> 01:34:16,690
I'd like to get them said
this time.

1785
01:34:16,805 --> 01:34:19,399
I'm not going to leave
until I do get them said.

1786
01:34:19,494 --> 01:34:21,018
Will the senator yield?

1787
01:34:21,158 --> 01:34:23,820
-Senator yields?
-No, sir, I'm afraid not!

1788
01:34:24,421 --> 01:34:25,547
No, sir.

1789
01:34:25,925 --> 01:34:29,759
I yielded the floor once before, and
I was practically never heard of again.

1790
01:34:29,958 --> 01:34:31,118
No, sir.

1791
01:34:32,070 --> 01:34:34,732
And we might as well all get together
on this "yielding" business...

1792
01:34:34,821 --> 01:34:35,845
...right off the bat now.

1793
01:34:39,302 --> 01:34:41,361
I had some pretty good
coaching last night...

1794
01:34:41,478 --> 01:34:43,412
...and I find that if l
yield only for a question...

1795
01:34:43,525 --> 01:34:45,755
...or point of order or personal
privilege, that I can...

1796
01:34:45,861 --> 01:34:48,386
...hold this floor
almost until doomsday.

1797
01:34:48,581 --> 01:34:50,708
In other words, I've got
a piece to speak...

1798
01:34:50,822 --> 01:34:52,551
...and blow hot or cold,
I'm going to speak it.

1799
01:34:52,677 --> 01:34:53,735
Will the senator yield?

1800
01:34:53,893 --> 01:34:55,588
-Will Senator Smith yield?
-Yield how?

1801
01:34:55,718 --> 01:34:57,686
-Will he yield for a question?
-All right.

1802
01:34:57,798 --> 01:34:59,732
I wish to ask my junior colleague...

1803
01:34:59,845 --> 01:35:01,437
...this piece he intends to speak...

1804
01:35:01,573 --> 01:35:04,440
...does it concern Section 40 of
that bill, the dam on Willet Creek?

1805
01:35:04,518 --> 01:35:07,180
Every aspect of this matter,
everything...

1806
01:35:07,269 --> 01:35:08,793
...was dealt with
in committee hearings.

1807
01:35:08,966 --> 01:35:11,833
-Mr. President?
-I ask my distinguished colleague...

1808
01:35:11,909 --> 01:35:13,604
...has he one scrap
of evidence to add now...

1809
01:35:13,766 --> 01:35:16,132
...to the defense he did not give and
could not give at that same hearing?

1810
01:35:16,229 --> 01:35:18,026
I have no defense
against forged papers!

1811
01:35:18,149 --> 01:35:19,275
The committee ruled otherwise!

1812
01:35:19,685 --> 01:35:22,677
The gentleman
stands guilty as charged.

1813
01:35:23,045 --> 01:35:24,774
And I believe I speak
for every member...

1814
01:35:24,901 --> 01:35:28,428
...when I say that no one cares to hear
what a man of his condemned character...

1815
01:35:28,485 --> 01:35:31,977
...has to say about any section
of any legislation before this House!

1816
01:35:32,037 --> 01:35:34,267
-Order, order, gentleman!
-Mr. President...

1817
01:35:34,405 --> 01:35:38,000
...I stand guilty as framed because
Section 40 is graft.

1818
01:35:38,118 --> 01:35:40,848
And I was ready to say so.
I was ready to tell you...

1819
01:35:40,933 --> 01:35:43,333
...that a certain man in my state,
Mr. James Taylor...

1820
01:35:43,429 --> 01:35:45,590
...wanted to put through this dam
for his own profit.

1821
01:35:45,702 --> 01:35:48,762
A man who controls
a political machine...

1822
01:35:48,837 --> 01:35:51,328
...and controls everything else
in my state.

1823
01:35:51,429 --> 01:35:53,920
A man even powerful enough
to control congressmen.

1824
01:35:54,021 --> 01:35:56,512
I saw three of them in his room
the day I went to see him.

1825
01:35:56,614 --> 01:35:58,878
-Will the senator yield?
-I will not yield!

1826
01:36:02,341 --> 01:36:04,571
This same man,
James Taylor, came down here...

1827
01:36:04,677 --> 01:36:07,077
...and offered me a seat
in this Senate for the next 20 years...

1828
01:36:07,429 --> 01:36:11,195
...if I voted for a dam that he knew
and I knew was a fraud...

1829
01:36:11,301 --> 01:36:13,701
...but if I dared to open
my mouth against that dam...

1830
01:36:13,797 --> 01:36:15,287
...he promised to break me in two.

1831
01:36:15,429 --> 01:36:18,193
I got up here and
I started to open my mouth...

1832
01:36:18,277 --> 01:36:20,677
...and the long and powerful arm
of Mr. Taylor...

1833
01:36:20,773 --> 01:36:24,368
...reached into this sacred chamber and
grabbed me by the scruff of the neck--

1834
01:36:24,421 --> 01:36:25,649
Mr. President, a point of order.

1835
01:36:25,797 --> 01:36:26,729
Mr. President?

1836
01:36:26,885 --> 01:36:28,250
Senator Paine will state it.

1837
01:36:28,581 --> 01:36:30,742
It was I who rose in this
chamber to accuse him.

1838
01:36:30,853 --> 01:36:33,481
He's saying that I was carrying out
criminal orders on falsified evidence.

1839
01:36:33,573 --> 01:36:36,599
He has imputed to me conduct
unworthy a senator, and I demand...

1840
01:36:36,645 --> 01:36:38,476
...that he yield the floor.

1841
01:36:38,598 --> 01:36:41,590
I did not say that Senator Paine was
one of the congressmen in that room!

1842
01:36:41,669 --> 01:36:42,658
I was in that room!

1843
01:36:44,805 --> 01:36:46,170
Order, gentlemen.

1844
01:36:47,653 --> 01:36:49,484
I accuse this man.

1845
01:36:49,605 --> 01:36:52,039
By his tone, by his careful
denials...

1846
01:36:52,133 --> 01:36:55,330
...he is trying to plant
damaging impressions on my conduct.

1847
01:36:55,461 --> 01:36:57,452
I'll tell you why
we were in that room.

1848
01:36:57,573 --> 01:37:00,667
Because Mr. Taylor, a respected
citizen of our state...

1849
01:37:00,741 --> 01:37:02,675
...had brought with him
the evidence against this man...

1850
01:37:02,789 --> 01:37:04,620
...and we were urging him to resign.

1851
01:37:04,741 --> 01:37:08,507
Why? To avoid bringing disgrace
upon a clean and honorable state.

1852
01:37:08,549 --> 01:37:09,880
But he refused!

1853
01:37:10,021 --> 01:37:10,885
Mr. President--

1854
01:37:11,045 --> 01:37:13,172
There is only one answer
to a man like him.

1855
01:37:13,253 --> 01:37:16,279
The truth, which I rose and gave
to this body.

1856
01:37:17,254 --> 01:37:18,585
Mr. President...

1857
01:37:18,725 --> 01:37:21,694
...he is trying to blackmail this
Senate as he tried to blackmail me.

1858
01:37:21,765 --> 01:37:23,665
To prevent his expulsion, he'll
even try to...

1859
01:37:23,781 --> 01:37:26,375
...hold up this Deficiency Bill,
vital to the country...

1860
01:37:26,469 --> 01:37:28,437
...which must be passed
immediately!

1861
01:37:28,549 --> 01:37:30,141
Have I the floor?

1862
01:37:30,342 --> 01:37:33,402
I have lost all patience
with this brazen character.

1863
01:37:33,477 --> 01:37:36,071
I apologize to this body
for his appointment.

1864
01:37:36,325 --> 01:37:38,156
I regret I ever knew him.
I'm sick...

1865
01:37:38,277 --> 01:37:39,574
...of this contemptible young man.

1866
01:37:39,717 --> 01:37:42,982
And I refuse to stay here
and listen to him any longer.

1867
01:37:43,109 --> 01:37:45,805
I hope every member
of this body feels as I do.

1868
01:37:45,893 --> 01:37:48,054
Get off the floor! Yield the floor!

1869
01:37:49,765 --> 01:37:50,925
Gentlemen!

1870
01:37:51,077 --> 01:37:53,978
Gentlemen, please address the chair!

1871
01:37:54,117 --> 01:37:56,847
Mr. President, what does
the gentleman want of this body?

1872
01:37:56,933 --> 01:37:58,127
I'll tell you, sir!

1873
01:37:58,277 --> 01:38:00,745
I want a chance to talk to people
who'll believe me.

1874
01:38:00,837 --> 01:38:03,533
The people of my state, they know me
and they know Mr. Taylor.

1875
01:38:03,621 --> 01:38:05,521
When they hear my story,
they'll rise up...

1876
01:38:05,637 --> 01:38:08,265
...and kick Taylor's machine
to kingdom come.

1877
01:38:08,357 --> 01:38:10,848
I want one week to go back there
and bring you proof.

1878
01:38:10,949 --> 01:38:13,281
In the meantime, I want
this Senate's promise...

1879
01:38:13,381 --> 01:38:16,111
...that I won't be expelled and
this bill will not be passed.

1880
01:38:16,197 --> 01:38:17,926
-Will the senator yield?
-For a question.

1881
01:38:18,053 --> 01:38:21,682
Has the gentleman the effrontery to
stand, convicted and in disgrace...

1882
01:38:21,733 --> 01:38:24,065
...and try to force postponement
of the Deficiency Bill?

1883
01:38:24,165 --> 01:38:25,757
-For one week.
-Mr. President!

1884
01:38:25,893 --> 01:38:27,520
I appeal to the senator.

1885
01:38:27,685 --> 01:38:30,984
Is he fully aware that this bill
has been months in both Houses...

1886
01:38:31,045 --> 01:38:32,706
...delayed and delayed?

1887
01:38:32,837 --> 01:38:34,771
Millions will be
without food and shelter.

1888
01:38:34,885 --> 01:38:37,012
Public works will be
at a standstill!

1889
01:38:37,125 --> 01:38:38,387
Will we keep
relief from the country?

1890
01:38:38,533 --> 01:38:39,966
The people of my state
need permanent relief...

1891
01:38:40,101 --> 01:38:41,728
...from crooked men riding their backs!

1892
01:38:41,861 --> 01:38:43,556
Mr. President, if the Senate yields...

1893
01:38:43,685 --> 01:38:46,586
...to this sort to blackmail,
it'll become a laughingstock.

1894
01:38:46,661 --> 01:38:48,856
It is an insult to this body
to have to listen.

1895
01:38:48,965 --> 01:38:51,160
An insult to our colleague,
Senator Paine.

1896
01:38:51,269 --> 01:38:53,237
I, for one, will follow
the senator's example...

1897
01:38:53,349 --> 01:38:57,251
...and refuse to remain in this chamber
as long as that man holds the floor!

1898
01:39:07,429 --> 01:39:08,953
Order, gentlemen!

1899
01:39:10,277 --> 01:39:13,906
I guess I'll have to speak to
the people of my state from right here!

1900
01:39:15,269 --> 01:39:16,293
I'll tell you...

1901
01:39:16,453 --> 01:39:18,819
...wild horses won't drag me
off this floor until those...

1902
01:39:18,917 --> 01:39:22,216
...people have heard everything I've
got to say, if it takes all winter!

1903
01:39:28,037 --> 01:39:29,664
Filibuster!

1904
01:39:43,013 --> 01:39:45,538
Well, Mr. President,
we seem to be alone.

1905
01:39:47,557 --> 01:39:50,890
I'm not complaining
for social reason, it's just....

1906
01:39:50,949 --> 01:39:55,113
I think it'd be a pity if these
gentlemen missed any of this. And....

1907
01:40:08,997 --> 01:40:11,830
I call the chair's attention to...

1908
01:40:14,181 --> 01:40:15,205
...to Rule Five...

1909
01:40:15,365 --> 01:40:17,060
...of the Standing Rules of the Senate.

1910
01:40:17,189 --> 01:40:19,020
Section...Section Three.

1911
01:40:19,557 --> 01:40:22,025
"lf it shall be found that
a quorum is not present...

1912
01:40:22,117 --> 01:40:24,677
...a majority of
the senators present--"

1913
01:40:25,285 --> 01:40:26,877
And that looks like me.

1914
01:40:29,733 --> 01:40:33,100
"--may direct the sergeant at
arms to request, and if necessary...

1915
01:40:33,157 --> 01:40:36,126
...compel the attendance
of the absent senators."

1916
01:40:36,773 --> 01:40:39,071
Well, Mr. President, I so direct.

1917
01:40:43,493 --> 01:40:46,519
The absence of a
quorum being suggested.

1918
01:40:47,685 --> 01:40:49,778
-Bring the call to quorum.
-Call to quorum.

1919
01:40:50,917 --> 01:40:53,943
There's no hurry, Mr. President.
I got plenty of time.

1920
01:40:57,957 --> 01:41:00,585
Quorum call! Call to quorum!

1921
01:41:07,877 --> 01:41:09,777
All senators wanted on the floor!

1922
01:41:12,581 --> 01:41:14,481
Clerk will call the roll.

1923
01:41:14,597 --> 01:41:16,588
-Mr. Agnew.
-Here.

1924
01:41:16,709 --> 01:41:18,199
Mr. Albert.

1925
01:41:18,341 --> 01:41:19,467
Mr. Alfred.

1926
01:41:19,621 --> 01:41:21,179
-Mr. Ashman.
-Here.

1927
01:41:21,669 --> 01:41:25,196
Joe, get this! Smith got the
floor and is holding it.

1928
01:41:25,253 --> 01:41:26,618
Just as they were
about to kick him out!

1929
01:41:26,756 --> 01:41:28,314
He did it, Diz. It's wonderful!

1930
01:41:28,453 --> 01:41:29,886
It was terrific!

1931
01:41:30,021 --> 01:41:33,252
A filibuster! This is the miracle l
wanted. What a yarn!

1932
01:41:33,317 --> 01:41:35,444
Get everything
he says back to that home state.

1933
01:41:35,557 --> 01:41:36,524
It's a pleasure!

1934
01:41:36,677 --> 01:41:38,668
They're going
to hear this in Patagonia.

1935
01:41:38,789 --> 01:41:41,417
In protest,
the whole Senate body walked out!

1936
01:41:41,508 --> 01:41:43,305
Not that straight stuff.
Kick it up.

1937
01:41:43,428 --> 01:41:45,419
Get on his side.
Fight for him, understand?

1938
01:41:45,541 --> 01:41:46,940
You love this monkey, don't you?

1939
01:41:47,077 --> 01:41:50,137
What do you think? Now
go to work. Do as I tell you.

1940
01:41:50,373 --> 01:41:53,206
Take this: This is the most
titanic battle of modern times.

1941
01:41:53,284 --> 01:41:55,752
A David without even a slingshot
rises to battle...

1942
01:41:55,845 --> 01:41:57,836
...against the mighty Goliath,
the Taylor machine...

1943
01:41:57,957 --> 01:42:00,585
...allegedly crooked inside and out.

1944
01:42:01,221 --> 01:42:02,950
For my money
you can drop the "allegedly."

1945
01:42:03,077 --> 01:42:04,601
We're bringing everybody up
from headquarters.

1946
01:42:04,741 --> 01:42:07,574
Where are they? Come on,
get these telegraphs moving!

1947
01:42:09,317 --> 01:42:10,875
-You get Hendricks?
-They're looking for him.

1948
01:42:11,013 --> 01:42:12,640
"They're looking for him." An editor.

1949
01:42:12,773 --> 01:42:14,536
Why isn't he at his desk,
where he belongs?

1950
01:42:14,661 --> 01:42:16,822
Don't you think you
better get back to that Senate?

1951
01:42:16,933 --> 01:42:18,730
The boy's talking to that state.

1952
01:42:18,852 --> 01:42:20,979
If he can raise public opinion
against us--

1953
01:42:21,093 --> 01:42:22,958
He'll never get started.

1954
01:42:23,077 --> 01:42:26,513
I'll make public opinion within 5 hours.
I've done it all my life.

1955
01:42:26,565 --> 01:42:28,533
I'll blacken this punk so....

1956
01:42:29,029 --> 01:42:30,496
Leave public opinion to me.

1957
01:42:30,629 --> 01:42:32,062
Now, go back into the Senate...

1958
01:42:32,197 --> 01:42:34,131
...and keep those senators lined up.

1959
01:42:34,245 --> 01:42:36,941
I hit him from the floor
with everything I knew.

1960
01:42:38,277 --> 01:42:40,302
I haven't got
the stomach for it anymore.

1961
01:42:40,421 --> 01:42:44,965
If he convinces those senators,
you might as well blow your brains out.

1962
01:42:44,965 --> 01:42:46,091
This is the works, Joe!

1963
01:42:46,245 --> 01:42:48,736
Either we're out of business or
we're bigger than ever.

1964
01:42:48,837 --> 01:42:52,773
We can't stop at anything until
we smash this yokel--

1965
01:42:52,804 --> 01:42:53,668
Hendricks on the phone.

1966
01:42:53,829 --> 01:42:55,228
Go back to the Senate,
will you?

1967
01:42:55,365 --> 01:42:57,925
Hello, Hendricks.
Well, the chips are down.

1968
01:42:58,021 --> 01:43:01,787
Keep everything that Smith says,
or any other pro-Smith stuff...

1969
01:43:01,829 --> 01:43:04,024
...out of all our newspapers.
Understand?

1970
01:43:04,165 --> 01:43:06,759
And all the others
you can line up in the state.

1971
01:43:07,812 --> 01:43:11,748
Those broken-down opposition papers,
who won't play ball with us...

1972
01:43:11,781 --> 01:43:14,443
...I want you to tie up for 24 hours.

1973
01:43:15,077 --> 01:43:18,513
Stall their deliveries. Push them off
the street. I don't care!

1974
01:43:18,565 --> 01:43:20,965
Bury them for 24 hours.
That'll give me plenty of time.

1975
01:43:21,061 --> 01:43:24,030
And you defend the machine.
Hit this guy!

1976
01:43:24,101 --> 01:43:27,366
The usual thing. Criminal, and
blocking a relief bill...

1977
01:43:27,429 --> 01:43:28,919
...and starving the people.

1978
01:43:29,061 --> 01:43:31,291
Joe, will you get back
into that Senate?

1979
01:43:33,925 --> 01:43:35,950
And Hendricks,
get the hoi polloi excited.

1980
01:43:36,069 --> 01:43:39,095
Have them send protest letters,
wires, anything you like.

1981
01:43:39,173 --> 01:43:42,267
Buy every minute you can
of every radio station in the state...

1982
01:43:42,341 --> 01:43:44,241
...and keep them
spouting against Smith.

1983
01:43:44,357 --> 01:43:46,120
I don't care what it costs.
Pay out.

1984
01:43:46,245 --> 01:43:47,974
Get moving.
Get the whole state moving!

1985
01:43:53,284 --> 01:43:56,219
This filibuster is a cowardly attempt
to turn your attention...

1986
01:43:56,293 --> 01:43:58,955
...from the true facts which
are beyond question.

1987
01:43:59,044 --> 01:44:02,036
Jefferson Smith was caught
red-handed, stealing from boys.

1988
01:44:02,117 --> 01:44:04,677
Relief will be stopped.
Men thrown out of jobs.

1989
01:44:14,404 --> 01:44:17,567
-I've seen filibustering, but--
-Smith can't go on. It's ridiculous.

1990
01:44:17,636 --> 01:44:19,604
We've got to get
him off the floor.

1991
01:44:19,749 --> 01:44:23,082
As long as Mr. Smith holds that
floor legitimately...

1992
01:44:23,141 --> 01:44:25,109
...he's going to continue to hold it.

1993
01:44:25,220 --> 01:44:27,654
If you ask me,
that fellow's making sense.

1994
01:44:27,748 --> 01:44:30,444
Sense? You call
blackmail sense, Henry?

1995
01:44:30,533 --> 01:44:33,127
Joe, I didn't like
this boy from the beginning.

1996
01:44:33,221 --> 01:44:34,984
But we feel that
no man who wasn't sincere...

1997
01:44:35,109 --> 01:44:37,134
...could fight like this
against these odds.

1998
01:44:37,285 --> 01:44:39,116
I'm very glad
to know that, Martin.

1999
01:44:39,237 --> 01:44:42,934
After 20 years, I'm very glad to know
you'd take his word against mine.

2000
01:44:42,981 --> 01:44:44,676
Yes, that's what it means!

2001
01:44:44,805 --> 01:44:46,796
If he's that much right,
then I'm wrong.

2002
01:44:46,917 --> 01:44:49,283
Joe, can't we
work out some deal...

2003
01:44:49,381 --> 01:44:52,544
...to pull that Willet Dam out and
let the Deficiency Bill go through?

2004
01:44:52,613 --> 01:44:54,308
It isn't a question of Willet Dam.

2005
01:44:54,437 --> 01:44:56,667
It's a question of my honor
and reputation.

2006
01:44:56,773 --> 01:45:01,073
The integrity of the Committee,
the integrity of the Senate itself.

2007
01:45:01,092 --> 01:45:02,889
If you want to throw out
Section 40, go ahead.

2008
01:45:03,012 --> 01:45:05,981
-I'll resign.
-Now, wait a minute, Joe.

2009
01:45:06,085 --> 01:45:07,848
This is a lot of nonsense.

2010
01:45:07,972 --> 01:45:10,440
Joe's right. A deal is impossible.

2011
01:45:10,533 --> 01:45:11,966
We've got to go on with this.

2012
01:45:12,101 --> 01:45:14,035
Break him, keep him talking.

2013
01:45:14,149 --> 01:45:17,243
No relief.
Maintain a quorum in relays.

2014
01:45:17,349 --> 01:45:19,579
-ls that how you feel, John?
-For once, I agree with you.

2015
01:45:19,684 --> 01:45:21,345
It's time to relieve
the floor.

2016
01:45:21,477 --> 01:45:24,378
How a man that green
knows as much as he does....

2017
01:45:24,453 --> 01:45:25,477
Can't go on much longer.

2018
01:45:25,637 --> 01:45:27,104
"--that they're entitled
by their creator...

2019
01:45:27,237 --> 01:45:28,966
...with certain inalienable rights...

2020
01:45:29,125 --> 01:45:32,094
...and that among these are life,
liberty, and the pursuit of--"

2021
01:45:34,948 --> 01:45:37,348
Well, looks like
the night shift's coming on.

2022
01:45:40,133 --> 01:45:43,569
Senator will please suspend until
order is restored.

2023
01:45:51,108 --> 01:45:52,666
This is H.V. Coltenborn speaking.

2024
01:45:52,805 --> 01:45:55,638
Half of official Washington is here
to see democracy's finest show...

2025
01:45:55,716 --> 01:45:58,514
...the filibuster: The right
to talk your head off.

2026
01:45:58,596 --> 01:46:01,656
The American privilege of free speech
in its most dramatic form.

2027
01:46:01,765 --> 01:46:03,733
The least man in that chamber...

2028
01:46:03,844 --> 01:46:06,278
...once he gets and holds that floor,
by the rules...

2029
01:46:06,372 --> 01:46:09,341
...can hold it and talk as long
as he can stand on his feet.

2030
01:46:09,445 --> 01:46:12,278
Providing always
that he does not sit down...

2031
01:46:12,357 --> 01:46:15,520
...and that he does not leave the
chamber or stop talking.

2032
01:46:15,589 --> 01:46:16,886
The galleries are packed.

2033
01:46:17,028 --> 01:46:20,464
In the diplomatic gallery are the
envoys of two dictator powers.

2034
01:46:20,516 --> 01:46:23,144
They have come here to see
what they can't see at home...

2035
01:46:23,237 --> 01:46:24,670
...democracy in action.

2036
01:46:25,605 --> 01:46:27,630
"--life, liberty and the
pursuit of happiness...

2037
01:46:27,748 --> 01:46:31,013
...and to secure these rights,
governments are instituted among men...

2038
01:46:31,076 --> 01:46:33,977
...deriving their just powers
from the consent of the governed...

2039
01:46:34,053 --> 01:46:37,887
...that whenever any form of government
becomes destructive to these ends...

2040
01:46:37,925 --> 01:46:41,554
...it is the right of the people
to alter or abolish it."

2041
01:46:41,829 --> 01:46:43,160
How am I doing?

2042
01:46:46,244 --> 01:46:48,735
-Quit stalling and move!
-Clark, Jim.

2043
01:46:48,964 --> 01:46:50,488
-Oh, Clark--
-Mr.Taylor?

2044
01:46:50,628 --> 01:46:51,856
Yes, wait a minute

2045
01:46:52,229 --> 01:46:53,594
Phone Senator Paine about it.

2046
01:46:53,733 --> 01:46:55,564
This is
Jim Taylor in Washington.

2047
01:46:55,684 --> 01:46:56,878
About this Smith filibuster.

2048
01:46:57,029 --> 01:46:59,361
Newspapers
in the Southwest must realize...

2049
01:46:59,461 --> 01:47:01,053
...that this bill
he's trying to block...

2050
01:47:01,188 --> 01:47:02,678
...will affect your section
as well as any.

2051
01:47:02,820 --> 01:47:04,617
It's the patriotic duty of every
newspaper--

2052
01:47:04,740 --> 01:47:06,071
Wait a minute. Yes?

2053
01:47:06,213 --> 01:47:07,771
-Jackson City calling.
-Hold them!

2054
01:47:07,908 --> 01:47:09,876
We've got to keep hammering
at this man until we smash him!

2055
01:47:11,364 --> 01:47:14,561
I get a great kick out of that part
of the Declaration of lndependence.

2056
01:47:14,948 --> 01:47:18,475
You're not going to have a country
that can make these rules work...

2057
01:47:18,565 --> 01:47:21,056
...if you haven't got men that have
learned to tell human rights...

2058
01:47:21,156 --> 01:47:22,350
...from a punch in the nose.

2059
01:47:27,268 --> 01:47:28,826
That's good for a headline.

2060
01:47:28,965 --> 01:47:31,331
It's a funny thing about men,
you know.

2061
01:47:31,429 --> 01:47:33,329
They all start life being boys...

2062
01:47:34,788 --> 01:47:37,382
...I wouldn't be surprised if
these senators were boys once.

2063
01:47:37,509 --> 01:47:39,739
That's why it seemed
like a good idea...

2064
01:47:39,844 --> 01:47:41,505
...to get the boys out
of crowded cities...

2065
01:47:41,637 --> 01:47:44,470
...and stuffy basements for a
couple of months out of the year...

2066
01:47:44,548 --> 01:47:47,073
...and build their bodies
and minds for a man-sized job...

2067
01:47:47,172 --> 01:47:49,868
...because they're going to be
behind these desks someday.

2068
01:47:50,885 --> 01:47:53,979
It seemed like a good idea, getting
boys from all over the country...

2069
01:47:54,052 --> 01:47:57,510
...boys of all nationalities and
ways of living.

2070
01:47:57,573 --> 01:47:58,471
Getting them together...

2071
01:47:59,044 --> 01:48:02,036
...Iet them find out what makes
different people tick.

2072
01:48:02,117 --> 01:48:05,211
Because I wouldn't give you 2 cents
for all your rules...

2073
01:48:05,285 --> 01:48:09,688
...if behind them they didn't have a
little ordinary everyday kindness...

2074
01:48:09,701 --> 01:48:13,467
...and a little looking out
for the other fellow too.

2075
01:48:21,284 --> 01:48:23,718
That's pretty important, all that.

2076
01:48:25,284 --> 01:48:28,151
It's just the blood and bone
and sinew of this democracy...

2077
01:48:28,229 --> 01:48:31,062
...that some great men handed down
to the human race, that's all!

2078
01:48:31,140 --> 01:48:34,576
But if you've got to build a dam
where that boys' camp ought to be...

2079
01:48:34,628 --> 01:48:38,826
...to pay off some political army,
that's a different thing. Oh, no!

2080
01:48:39,108 --> 01:48:42,271
If you think I'm going back and
tell those boys in my state...

2081
01:48:42,341 --> 01:48:44,206
..."Fellows,
forget about it.

2082
01:48:44,324 --> 01:48:48,226
All I've been telling you about the
land you live in is a lot of hooey.

2083
01:48:48,260 --> 01:48:52,492
This isn't your country. It belongs to
a lot of James Taylors." No, not me.

2084
01:48:52,516 --> 01:48:55,212
Anybody here that thinks I'd do that,
they got another thing coming!

2085
01:49:04,773 --> 01:49:07,537
I just wanted to
find out if you still had faces.

2086
01:49:13,924 --> 01:49:16,188
Oh, I'm sorry, gentlemen.

2087
01:49:17,445 --> 01:49:21,176
I know I'm being disrespectful to
this honorable body.

2088
01:49:21,476 --> 01:49:25,810
A guy like me should never be allowed
to get in here in the first place.

2089
01:49:25,829 --> 01:49:30,163
And I hate to stand here and
try your patience like this, but l--

2090
01:49:30,181 --> 01:49:32,741
Either I'm dead right or I'm crazy!

2091
01:49:32,836 --> 01:49:35,930
You wouldn't care to put that
to a vote, would you, senator?

2092
01:49:38,373 --> 01:49:40,933
-Will the senator yield for a question?
-I yield.

2093
01:49:41,028 --> 01:49:43,758
In view of the gentlemen's touching
concern for the senators...

2094
01:49:43,844 --> 01:49:46,608
...and the fact that he's been
talking for 7 1 /2 hours...

2095
01:49:46,693 --> 01:49:48,957
...and must be very, very tired...

2096
01:49:49,060 --> 01:49:51,654
...would he permit a motion to recess
until the morning...

2097
01:49:51,749 --> 01:49:55,913
...at which time he may better continue
with his profound babblings.

2098
01:49:55,941 --> 01:49:57,340
No. No, don't!

2099
01:50:00,805 --> 01:50:01,635
Ask him!

2100
01:50:09,316 --> 01:50:11,807
Mr. President, what happens
in the morning...

2101
01:50:11,909 --> 01:50:13,342
...I mean, about my...

2102
01:50:13,477 --> 01:50:16,640
...having this floor to
go on with my "babblings"?

2103
01:50:16,709 --> 01:50:19,678
If the senator permits
this motion for a recess...

2104
01:50:19,749 --> 01:50:21,182
...he won't have the floor
in the morning...

2105
01:50:21,317 --> 01:50:22,978
...to babble with or anything else...

2106
01:50:23,429 --> 01:50:26,887
...unless he is recognized first
by this chair.

2107
01:50:34,245 --> 01:50:36,304
As I was saying, gentlemen...

2108
01:50:37,029 --> 01:50:38,997
...I'm either dead right
or I'm crazy...

2109
01:50:39,108 --> 01:50:41,042
...and I feel fine.

2110
01:50:41,156 --> 01:50:43,886
-What have you got, Dick?
-From Miss Saunders.

2111
01:51:08,996 --> 01:51:10,463
Is the senator yielding the floor?

2112
01:51:13,157 --> 01:51:15,455
Yield? Oh, no!

2113
01:51:16,708 --> 01:51:17,970
I feel fine!

2114
01:51:20,708 --> 01:51:23,643
The Constitution of the United States.

2115
01:51:29,668 --> 01:51:32,364
Page one, top left-hand corner.

2116
01:51:32,805 --> 01:51:34,329
"We the people of the United States...

2117
01:51:34,468 --> 01:51:36,060
...in order to form
a more perfect union...."

2118
01:51:36,197 --> 01:51:38,097
Yeah? Well, buy it or wreck it!

2119
01:51:38,725 --> 01:51:41,023
Brady's column too?
Holy smokes!

2120
01:51:41,124 --> 01:51:42,091
What's the matter?

2121
01:51:42,244 --> 01:51:44,542
This is murder,
you got to call him off.

2122
01:51:44,644 --> 01:51:46,578
-He's getting nowhere.
-What are you talking about?

2123
01:51:46,757 --> 01:51:48,850
Not one word of what he says
is being printed in that state.

2124
01:51:49,029 --> 01:51:49,961
Oh, no!

2125
01:51:50,116 --> 01:51:52,744
Taylor has practically every paper
in the state lined up...

2126
01:51:52,836 --> 01:51:54,497
...and he's feeding them
doctored-up junk!

2127
01:51:54,628 --> 01:51:57,688
-One man muzzling a whole state?
-And how!

2128
01:51:57,796 --> 01:51:59,889
Freedom of the press!

2129
01:52:01,636 --> 01:52:03,831
Wait a minute! I've got an idea!

2130
01:52:04,997 --> 01:52:07,989
Jeff has a paper there,
Boy Stuff, right?

2131
01:52:08,356 --> 01:52:09,186
Terrific!

2132
01:52:09,348 --> 01:52:12,681
They aren't letting what Jeff says
get printed in the state.

2133
01:52:12,740 --> 01:52:14,867
If I give you a raft
over the phone now--

2134
01:52:14,980 --> 01:52:16,743
Write me a front-page raft, Diz.

2135
01:52:16,869 --> 01:52:18,336
Can you print it out...

2136
01:52:18,468 --> 01:52:20,766
...and spread a billion copies of it?

2137
01:52:20,868 --> 01:52:22,267
Swell!

2138
01:52:22,404 --> 01:52:24,235
Get ready to take it down,
will you, Mrs. Smith?

2139
01:52:24,420 --> 01:52:25,387
All right.

2140
01:52:25,540 --> 01:52:28,532
Boys, everything about Jeff.
Get pencils and paper, quick!

2141
01:52:29,988 --> 01:52:31,216
All right, here we go!

2142
01:52:31,525 --> 01:52:32,583
All ready, Clarissa.

2143
01:52:32,996 --> 01:52:35,226
She called me Clarissa!

2144
01:52:35,844 --> 01:52:37,709
Okay, Ma!

2145
01:52:38,597 --> 01:52:40,724
"Jeff Tells Truth.

2146
01:52:41,028 --> 01:52:42,188
Shows Up Taylor."

2147
01:52:42,564 --> 01:52:44,964
I want the whole morning edition.
Push him off the floor!

2148
01:52:45,092 --> 01:52:47,060
Start your campaign
for protests. Wired!

2149
01:52:47,620 --> 01:52:50,555
"Willet Dam is a fraud to
line the pockets of the T aylor machine."

2150
01:52:50,628 --> 01:52:52,721
Here's your front-page editorial.
Wait!

2151
01:52:53,476 --> 01:52:54,568
"A convicted thief representing you...

2152
01:52:54,724 --> 01:52:56,749
...holds the floor of
the United States Senate. "

2153
01:52:56,964 --> 01:52:58,329
All right, boys. Hurry up!

2154
01:52:58,468 --> 01:53:00,698
She said rush!
Get cracking now!

2155
01:53:09,444 --> 01:53:11,503
Come on!
Bring on the paper!

2156
01:53:48,228 --> 01:53:51,629
"--charity wanteth not itself...

2157
01:53:52,036 --> 01:53:53,469
...is not propped up...

2158
01:53:56,132 --> 01:53:59,124
...and now abideth faith...

2159
01:53:59,845 --> 01:54:02,279
...hope, charity...

2160
01:54:02,596 --> 01:54:04,063
...these three.

2161
01:54:05,957 --> 01:54:08,721
The greatest of these is charity."

2162
01:54:49,252 --> 01:54:50,184
Read about Jeff.

2163
01:54:50,373 --> 01:54:52,898
Boy's Stuff circulars.
Peddled by 9 million kids.

2164
01:54:52,996 --> 01:54:56,295
What are you standing there for?
Get the boys out! Kill it!

2165
01:55:09,636 --> 01:55:11,797
Get these papers out of here.

2166
01:55:17,060 --> 01:55:19,961
Read all about it!
Jeff Smith lies in Senate!

2167
01:55:32,228 --> 01:55:34,822
Wire Congress!

2168
01:55:39,941 --> 01:55:43,536
Are we going to let a man like Jeff
throw mud at a man like Joe Paine?

2169
01:55:45,252 --> 01:55:46,514
Are you for Joe Paine?

2170
01:55:49,828 --> 01:55:51,762
Hurray for Jeff Smith!

2171
01:56:06,532 --> 01:56:08,432
Children hurt all over the city.

2172
01:56:08,548 --> 01:56:09,674
Tell Jeff to stop!

2173
01:56:10,692 --> 01:56:13,058
Yes, all right.

2174
01:56:13,156 --> 01:56:14,384
Goodbye.

2175
01:56:16,164 --> 01:56:19,600
"Senator Smith has now talked
for 23 hours and 1 6 minutes.

2176
01:56:19,620 --> 01:56:22,350
It's the most unusual and spectacular
thing in the Senate annuls.

2177
01:56:22,436 --> 01:56:23,926
One lone and simple American...

2178
01:56:24,068 --> 01:56:25,763
...holding the greatest
floor in the land.

2179
01:56:25,892 --> 01:56:28,588
What he lacked in experience,
he's made up in fight.

2180
01:56:28,804 --> 01:56:31,329
But those tired Boy Ranger legs
are buckling.

2181
01:56:31,428 --> 01:56:33,089
Bleary-eyed, voice gone.

2182
01:56:33,220 --> 01:56:36,018
He can't go on much longer.
And all official Washington...

2183
01:56:36,100 --> 01:56:37,931
...is here to be in on the kill."

2184
01:56:38,788 --> 01:56:41,256
There's no compromise with truth.

2185
01:56:41,348 --> 01:56:44,283
That's all I got up
on this floor to say.

2186
01:56:44,740 --> 01:56:46,037
When was it?

2187
01:56:46,884 --> 01:56:48,146
A year ago, it seems like.

2188
01:56:48,292 --> 01:56:51,284
Terrible things are happening.
I've got to stop him.

2189
01:56:51,364 --> 01:56:52,854
They're listening to him.
Anything might happen now.

2190
01:56:52,964 --> 01:56:56,491
Just get up off the ground.
That's all I ask.

2191
01:56:56,548 --> 01:56:59,847
Get up there with that lady
that's on top of this Capitol dome.

2192
01:56:59,908 --> 01:57:02,001
That lady that stands for liberty.

2193
01:57:02,724 --> 01:57:05,818
Look at this country through her eyes
if you want to see something.

2194
01:57:07,012 --> 01:57:08,946
But you won't just see scenery.

2195
01:57:09,060 --> 01:57:11,961
You'll see the whole parade of what
man's carved out for himself...

2196
01:57:12,036 --> 01:57:14,061
...after centuries of fighting.

2197
01:57:14,436 --> 01:57:17,064
Fighting for something better
than just jungle law.

2198
01:57:17,348 --> 01:57:21,148
Fighting so he can stand on
his own two feet, free and decent...

2199
01:57:21,188 --> 01:57:22,553
...Iike he was created.

2200
01:57:22,692 --> 01:57:25,422
No matter what his race,
color or creed.

2201
01:57:27,556 --> 01:57:29,148
That's what you'd see.

2202
01:57:30,340 --> 01:57:32,501
There's no place
out there for graft...

2203
01:57:32,612 --> 01:57:34,443
...or greed or lies...

2204
01:57:34,564 --> 01:57:37,294
...or compromise with human liberties.

2205
01:57:37,380 --> 01:57:40,907
If that's what the grownups
have done with this world...

2206
01:57:40,964 --> 01:57:42,795
...we better get those
boys' camps started fast...

2207
01:57:42,916 --> 01:57:44,941
...and see what the kids can do.

2208
01:57:45,700 --> 01:57:47,497
It's not too late.

2209
01:57:47,908 --> 01:57:50,741
Because this country is
bigger than the Taylors...

2210
01:57:50,820 --> 01:57:52,913
...or you or me or anything else!

2211
01:57:54,564 --> 01:57:57,465
Great principles don't get lost once
they come to light.

2212
01:57:57,540 --> 01:57:59,474
They're right here!

2213
01:57:59,620 --> 01:58:02,054
You just have to see them again.

2214
01:58:05,188 --> 01:58:06,746
Mr. President.

2215
01:58:07,108 --> 01:58:08,439
Will the senator yield
for a question?

2216
01:58:09,092 --> 01:58:10,855
Will Senator Smith yield
to his colleague?

2217
01:58:11,236 --> 01:58:13,227
Yes, I yield for a question.

2218
01:58:13,348 --> 01:58:16,875
The senator has said he is speaking
to the people of his state.

2219
01:58:16,932 --> 01:58:19,901
He has been waiting,
as he so fancifully puts it...

2220
01:58:20,004 --> 01:58:22,438
...for them to come
marching here in droves.

2221
01:58:22,596 --> 01:58:25,656
Would the gentlemen be interested
in what those people have to say?

2222
01:58:25,732 --> 01:58:27,359
Here it comes.

2223
01:58:27,524 --> 01:58:29,219
Yes, sir, you bet I would.

2224
01:58:30,596 --> 01:58:31,563
Mr. President.

2225
01:58:31,716 --> 01:58:33,377
Have I permission to bring in...

2226
01:58:33,508 --> 01:58:35,499
...evidence of
the response of my state?

2227
01:58:35,620 --> 01:58:37,451
Is there objection?

2228
01:58:38,532 --> 01:58:39,624
You may proceed, senator.

2229
01:58:39,780 --> 01:58:41,145
Pageboys!

2230
01:59:15,140 --> 01:59:18,735
I can't stand it. I can't stand
to see him hurt like this.

2231
01:59:18,788 --> 01:59:20,221
Public opinion made to order.

2232
01:59:20,356 --> 01:59:21,880
Taylor-made.

2233
01:59:22,244 --> 01:59:25,805
There it is.
There's the gentleman's answer.

2234
01:59:25,860 --> 01:59:28,351
Telegrams. 50,000 of them...

2235
01:59:28,452 --> 01:59:30,010
...demanding that he yield this floor.

2236
01:59:30,148 --> 01:59:31,672
I invite the Senate to read them.

2237
01:59:31,844 --> 01:59:33,573
I invite my colleague to read them.

2238
01:59:33,700 --> 01:59:36,362
The people's answer to
Mr. Jefferson Smith.

2239
02:00:18,372 --> 02:00:20,272
Stop, Jeff! Stop!

2240
02:01:03,396 --> 02:01:06,888
I guess this is just another
lost cause, Mr. Paine.

2241
02:01:11,747 --> 02:01:15,046
All you people don't know
about lost causes.

2242
02:01:15,491 --> 02:01:17,049
Mr. Paine does.

2243
02:01:19,044 --> 02:01:22,571
He said once they were
the only causes worth fighting for.

2244
02:01:22,915 --> 02:01:24,974
He fought for them once.

2245
02:01:25,380 --> 02:01:28,975
For the only reason that any man
ever fights for them.

2246
02:01:31,940 --> 02:01:35,341
Because of just one plain, simple rule:

2247
02:01:36,003 --> 02:01:37,197
Love thy neighbor.

2248
02:01:38,852 --> 02:01:40,046
In this world today...

2249
02:01:40,195 --> 02:01:41,253
...full of hatred...

2250
02:01:41,411 --> 02:01:44,312
...a man who knows that one rule
has a great trust.

2251
02:01:44,387 --> 02:01:46,981
You know that rule, Mr. Paine.

2252
02:01:47,460 --> 02:01:50,588
And I loved you for it,
just as my father did.

2253
02:01:50,692 --> 02:01:54,128
And you know you fight for lost causes
harder than for any others.

2254
02:01:54,499 --> 02:01:56,729
Yes, you even die for them.

2255
02:01:58,339 --> 02:02:00,933
Like a man we both knew, Mr. Paine.

2256
02:02:03,972 --> 02:02:05,769
You think I'm licked.

2257
02:02:07,843 --> 02:02:09,208
You all think I'm licked!

2258
02:02:11,012 --> 02:02:12,946
Well, I'm not licked!

2259
02:02:13,060 --> 02:02:16,120
I'm going to stay right here
and fight for this lost cause!

2260
02:02:16,196 --> 02:02:19,791
Even if this room gets
filled with lies like these...

2261
02:02:20,452 --> 02:02:24,912
...and the Taylors and all their armies
come marching into this place.

2262
02:02:25,827 --> 02:02:28,022
Somebody will listen to me.

2263
02:02:50,500 --> 02:02:52,468
He's okay. He just fainted.

2264
02:03:04,260 --> 02:03:05,887
-Let me go!
-What's the matter, Joe?

2265
02:03:06,020 --> 02:03:08,284
I'm not fit to be a senator!
I'm not fit to live!

2266
02:03:08,388 --> 02:03:09,821
Expel me!

2267
02:03:09,956 --> 02:03:11,082
Expel me, not him!

2268
02:03:11,236 --> 02:03:12,362
Willy Taylor's a fraud!

2269
02:03:12,515 --> 02:03:14,540
It's a crime against
the people who sent me here...

2270
02:03:14,660 --> 02:03:17,220
...and I committed it! Every word
that boy said is the truth!

2271
02:03:17,348 --> 02:03:19,373
Every word about Taylor
and me and graft...

2272
02:03:19,524 --> 02:03:21,788
...and the rotten political
corruption in my state!

2273
02:03:21,892 --> 02:03:24,417
Every word of it is true!
I'm not fit for office!

2274
02:03:24,516 --> 02:03:26,450
I'm not fit for
any place of honor or trust!

2275
02:03:26,563 --> 02:03:28,326
Expel me, not that boy!

2276
02:03:37,188 --> 02:03:39,019
We did it! We did it!

2277
02:03:43,364 --> 02:03:45,457
Order gentlemen! Please!

2278
02:03:54,755 --> 02:03:55,744
He did it!

2279
02:03:55,907 --> 02:03:57,602
Let go of me!

2280
02:04:01,156 --> 02:04:02,783
Yippee!
