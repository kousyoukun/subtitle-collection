1
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:09,620
<i>When I was little,
my parents were my first heroes.</i>

2
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:13,120
<i>But then life got more complicated.</i>

3
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:15,250
<i>That's a kaiju.</i>

4
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:19,250
<i>Not a hero, but not a villain either.</i>

5
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:23,040
<i>There he is.</i>

6
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:25,370
<i>That's our hero.</i>

7
00:00:26,290 --> 00:00:27,750
<i>Ultraman.</i>

8
00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:34,250
<i>For 30 years, he protected us,</i>

9
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:37,700
<i>using his amazing powers
to keep everyone safe.</i>

10
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:40,500
<i>He called it maintaining balance.</i>

11
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:43,000
<i>I just called it cool.</i>

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,290
<i>But being a hero, an idol, an icon?
It ain't what you think.</i>

13
00:00:48,830 --> 00:00:50,830
<i>It's up to you to make the tough choices,</i>

14
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:53,790
<i>decide who matters most.</i>

15
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:57,160
<i>But it's not the toughest job.</i>

16
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:58,950
<i>The toughest job...</i>

17
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:03,450
<i>Well, I had no idea
until it was my turn.</i>

18
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,870
<i>♪ Da, da, da, da! ♪</i>

19
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:24,080
<i>...with the windup.
Here's the pitch. Inside.</i>

20
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,870
Schu-- Schuwatch!

21
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:28,500
I am Ultraman!

22
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:31,500
- Ultraman, we must check the curry!

23
00:01:34,410 --> 00:01:36,160
Mina, status report.

24
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:38,250
<i>Temperature is steady,</i>

25
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:41,370
<i>but it needs a good stir, Professor Sato.</i>

26
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:43,750
What do you think?

27
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:46,000
Mmm... Ten more minutes.

28
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:50,370
Yep, ten more minutes.

29
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,160
What are you looking at?

30
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,040
Nothing.

31
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,500
Hey, Ultraman!

32
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:58,580
When you're finished
saving your dad's curry,

33
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:01,450
you might want to fly on over here
and save your team.

34
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:06,200
<i>Now, here comes Matsui!</i>

35
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:09,950
The Tigers are losing.
Probably should leave your mother alone.

36
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:13,370
Not today, Gomora!

37
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:15,370
Ultraman, use your force shield.

38
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:21,250
Too strong. Can't hold much longer.

39
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:23,500
- Distract with Ultra Slash!

40
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:25,000
Get back, monster!

41
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,160
- Ultraman!
- Huh?

42
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,580
It's your color timer.

43
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:32,620
You must stay focused
or you will change back to human form.

44
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:41,700
Kenji. Ultraman's most important task
is finding balance.

45
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:43,790
Understand?

46
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:47,660
Hey, give Mama a bonk.

47
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:50,000
<i>Here's the pitch.</i>

48
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:53,660
<i>Swung on in a high fly,
hit deep to center field.</i>

49
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:55,750
Oh, yeah, Matsui!

50
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:58,290
Yeah, he's pretty great.

51
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:00,080
Too bad he plays for the Giants.

52
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,080
Mama. Come on.
He's the best player in the league.

53
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:06,500
Ahhh! Sonic attack!

54
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:11,540
No! Make it stop!

55
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:17,200
Kenji, if you could be anyone,
what would you choose?

56
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:20,660
Matsui or Ultraman?

57
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:26,750
That's a big question
for such a little boy.

58
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:32,910
<i>Incoming call from Dr. Onda.</i>

59
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:34,870
<i>Emiko. Hayao--</i>

60
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:36,950
<i>...level our defenses.</i>

61
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:39,410
<i>Your family, mine, are in danger.</i>

62
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:41,200
<i>Gigantron is coming.</i>

63
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,250
<i>Gigantron is coming to you.</i>

64
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:49,000
I'll go. You stay here with Kenji.

65
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,450
Don't go, Daddy.

66
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:52,080
Please stay.

67
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,790
Watch the game with us.

68
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:56,330
I'll be back
before the seventh inning stretch.

69
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,000
Promise?

70
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:28,080
Daddy.

71
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,910
<i>Hey, Kenji, it's Dad.</i>

72
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:45,500
<i>You're mad at me. I get it.</i>

73
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:51,000
<i>I know it wasn't an easy choice
leaving your life behind.</i>

74
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:55,290
<i>LA, the Dodgers,
millions of adoring fans.</i>

75
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:59,540
<i>But what I'm asking
is bigger than baseball.</i>

76
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:04,750
<i>The world needs you
to become something...</i>

77
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,120
{\an8}<i>...more.</i>

78
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:11,910
<i>Sorry, your mom was better at this.</i>

79
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:14,200
<i>Anyway, I'm around.</i>

80
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:19,540
<i>For the last few weeks,
one name has dominated the headlines</i>

81
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:23,250
<i>in what is sure to be
a historic moment in baseball.</i>

82
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,910
<i>In just three days,
Giants fans will welcome a legend</i>

83
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:29,660
<i>to the New Tokyo Dome</i>

84
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:33,200
<i>as Ken Sato returns
to the land of his birth.</i>

85
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:38,250
<i>Now, please join me
in welcoming him back to Japan,</i>

86
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:41,000
<i>the newest member of our Giants family,</i>

87
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,040
<i>- Ken Sato!
- </i>

88
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,910
Ken!
- Thanks for waiting, folks.

89
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:48,370
All right, who's first?

90
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:50,040
I do it for the fans.

91
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:52,370
It's all about fundamentals.

92
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:56,540
{\an8}No, no, no. What I said was
I am the greatest "living" player.

93
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:58,870
Well, Otani can say whatever he likes.

94
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:01,500
Aw, that's too sweet. Thank you.

95
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,750
I love baseball. It's all I've got.

96
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:05,660
Bone broth and wheat grass, bro.

97
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:07,830
Bro. Bro. Bro!

98
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:10,700
The rookie? This ain't tee-ball, bro.

99
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:14,750
American players are very different.

100
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:18,330
How are you adjusting
to the Japanese style of play?

101
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:20,120
Itow-san, right?

102
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:22,160
Baseball is baseball, man.

103
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,540
The Ken Sato show is the same.

104
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:26,750
Here, the States, wherever.

105
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:29,290
Mr. Sato. Why did you come back to Japan?

106
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:32,750
I... I'm sorry. What's your name?

107
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:34,450
Ami Wakita.

108
00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:35,620
Hold up. Hold up.

109
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:37,700
- You're the Tigers fan, right?

110
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:40,450
The question
isn't who <i>I</i> root for, Mr. Sato.

111
00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:43,410
The question is why,
on the verge of your first championship,

112
00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:45,950
you choose to walk away and start over.

113
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:48,750
Some suggest it was emotional stress.

114
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:51,000
- Due to family--
- This is baseball. Not gossip hour.

115
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
- Guys! Play nice, okay?
Sit down.

116
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:56,410
I'm happy to answer the question.

117
00:06:56,410 --> 00:06:58,870
Miss Wakita, please continue.

118
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:01,040
Thank you.

119
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:04,620
Some speculate your departure
was connected to the loss of your mother,

120
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:07,950
that there was
some sort of unfinished family business.

121
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:09,290
<i>Kenji.</i>

122
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:13,000
My apologies, Miss Wakita.

123
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:17,290
Unfortunately,
I have a fan event to attend. Uh<i>...</i>

124
00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:19,540
I look forward to seeing you all
in a couple of days

125
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:23,660
where I promise
the Ken Sato show will be in full effect.

126
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:25,290
- Much love.

127
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:30,620
<i>- </i> [Mina] <i>Neronga is attacking Akihabara.</i>
- Ah, crap.

128
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:32,660
Oi! Sato!

129
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:34,790
Hey, Coach Shimura.

130
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:36,200
You can't charm me.

131
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:39,750
There's no place
for the Ken Sato show on my team.

132
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:41,790
Look, I get it.

133
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:44,200
It's been a rough couple of years
for you guys,

134
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,370
but I'm here to help.

135
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:48,950
Let me drive, win some games,

136
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:52,500
and we can get this team
back on top where it belongs.

137
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,660
See? Right there. That's your problem.

138
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:56,540
No humility.

139
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:59,120
It takes more than attitude
to become a Giant.

140
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,290
I stopped believing in Giants
a long time ago.

141
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:21,790
<i>You need to get Neronga out of here</i>

142
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:24,250
<i>with as little damage as possible.</i>

143
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:25,580
Give me a break, Mina.

144
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:29,000
I'm doing the best I can.

145
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:35,250
All right.

146
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:38,620
<i>- </i>  Stop. Why ya gotta make this so hard?

147
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:40,790
Just turn around--

148
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,200
Okay, I tried the easy way.

149
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:57,540
Yeah! How awesome was that?

150
00:08:57,540 --> 00:09:01,080
<i>- </i>  Hey, where's the love?

151
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,540
Ultraman!

152
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:05,500
Stop showboating and do your job!

153
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:07,620
Um, I think I just did.

154
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:18,080
<i>Are you okay?</i>

155
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:20,290
Define "okay."

156
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:21,290
<i>Ken, watch out!</i>

157
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:34,200
<i>This is the Kaiju Defense Force.
Evacuate the area immediately.</i>

158
00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:37,250
Guys! We're all good here.

159
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:38,950
I was just wrapping things up.

160
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:40,330
<i>You've been warned before.</i>

161
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:43,120
<i>You are not
an authorized government agent.</i>

162
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,910
<i>Evacuate immediately
or you will be placed into cust--</i>

163
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:49,120
Dang!

164
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,830
Is that what happens
to authorized government agents?

165
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:52,790
- Uh-oh.

166
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:55,500
<i>Ken, you need to get
the situation under control.</i>

167
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,120
The electric armadillo started it.

168
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,870
<i>Your heart rate is spiking.
- </i>

169
00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:01,160
<i>You know what happens
when Ultraman gets stressed.</i>

170
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,580
Um, no? Remind me again.

171
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:05,290
<i>Your color timer changes
and you lose your powers.</i>

172
00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:06,290
Great.

173
00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:21,830
<i>We interrupt this program
to bring you live coverage</i>

174
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:24,790
<i>of yet another kaiju attack
in downtown Tokyo.</i>

175
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,200
Mmm.

176
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:28,910
Do something.

177
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:34,330
Ugh.

178
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:36,580
Did he call?
He's definitely gonna call.

179
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:37,870
<i>Yes, he called.</i>

180
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:41,000
Hmm. Awesome.

181
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,750
Oh, God.

182
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:47,000
Oh, yeah, come to Japan,
help your dad, save the world.

183
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,290
It'll be great.

184
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:53,950
<i>Ken, the KDF
seem to be using excessive force.</i>

185
00:10:57,910 --> 00:11:00,080
<i>Shall I plot a course back to the battle?</i>

186
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:05,200
You know what?
I'mma punch out for the night.

187
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,540
Let the KDF handle it.

188
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:12,330
Right on time. Here comes the guilt trip.

189
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:14,290
<i>He's already left 10 messages.</i>

190
00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:16,450
<i>Kenji!
You must go back--</i>

191
00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:18,000
<i>You have a responsibility.</i>

192
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,290
Nope. No, thanks.
I've had my butt kicked enough tonight.

193
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:24,250
Please silence all calls, Mina.
I need some me time.

194
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:26,790
<i>After your interview
with Miss Wakita, of course.</i>

195
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:29,290
Wait. The same lady
from the press conference?

196
00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:32,830
<i>Yes, Ken.
The same lady from the press conference.</i>

197
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:34,290
<i>And you're an hour late.</i>

198
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,950
I heard you're really good
at avoiding hard questions.

199
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:47,450
Mmm!

200
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:50,580
These noodles are killer. Want some?

201
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:53,160
I'm okay. Thanks.

202
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:54,950
Mind if I record?

203
00:11:54,950 --> 00:11:56,410
Mmm. Do your thing.

204
00:11:57,290 --> 00:11:59,330
So you've had an impressive career.

205
00:11:59,330 --> 00:12:01,790
Gold Glove, Silver Slugger.

206
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:03,040
Tea?

207
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,080
And yet you've never won a championship.

208
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:09,540
Wow! Right for the throat.

209
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:11,120
It's just an observation.

210
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:14,700
"Just an observation." Sure.

211
00:12:15,410 --> 00:12:18,200
You know, there are lots of great players
who never won titles.

212
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:22,580
Yes, and some say
you're better than all of them.

213
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:24,700
"Some"?

214
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:26,450
You have seen me play, right?

215
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:30,450
420 batting average. 624 stolen bases.

216
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:31,950
But?

217
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:35,660
But personal stats
don't win championships.

218
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:38,200
So my <i>ego</i> is holding me back?

219
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,870
I didn't say that.

220
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:42,950
And, to be honest,
I'm not really here to discuss stats.

221
00:12:42,950 --> 00:12:44,910
Then why are we discussing stats?

222
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:48,870
Because players are more comfortable
talking about stats than themselves.

223
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:50,660
Hey, I'm happy to talk about me.

224
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:51,950
Great.

225
00:12:51,950 --> 00:12:53,870
Because I want to know why.

226
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:57,750
Why you avoid most interviews,
why you keep your teammates at a distance,

227
00:12:57,750 --> 00:13:01,000
and why you left a city
that loves you to<i>...</i>

228
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,330
You know, you're supposed
to dip the noodles <i>in</i> the sauce.

229
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,370
I like doing things my way.

230
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:13,830
Okay.

231
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:16,200
Let's rewind.

232
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,040
Earlier, I asked about your mother.

233
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:19,950
Here we go.

234
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:23,910
You both moved to LA when you were young,
your father stayed behind.

235
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:25,540
That couldn't have been easy.

236
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:29,080
Yeah. Well, Dad wasn't really
paying attention when...

237
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:42,120
Kids ever make fun of how you talk?
How you look? What you eat?

238
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:46,620
You learn real quick
that they're gonna talk no matter what.

239
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:50,330
So you give them
something else to talk about.

240
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:54,540
Can I print that?

241
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,580
- Chiho! What are you doing?
- Mama!

242
00:13:58,580 --> 00:13:59,540
Uh...

243
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:02,000
Schuwatch!

244
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,830
- Uh-uh. No. No kids on the table.
- No, no, no.

245
00:14:04,830 --> 00:14:06,040
- Oh, God, I'm so sorry.

246
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:08,200
- Here.
- My mom's supposed to be watching her.

247
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:10,330
You know what? You look really good.

248
00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:13,200
- Chiho! Down, now.
- Ultraman's the best!

249
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:38,790
Each of you has experienced
the loss of colleagues, friends

250
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:44,580
and even family to the devastation caused
by the horrible kaiju scourge.

251
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:48,540
I've felt that pain, that loss,

252
00:14:49,290 --> 00:14:54,790
and I wake up every morning, asking myself
how I can stop it from happening again.

253
00:14:56,120 --> 00:15:00,330
But our shared sacrifices
have not been in vain.

254
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:04,370
Today is a landmark day.

255
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:06,830
And thanks to your courageous efforts,

256
00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:11,370
very soon our families
and the families of this country

257
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:15,250
will be able to live
in a better world, a safer world.

258
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:19,160
A world absent from fear.

259
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,040
<i>Vulture's Nest
this is Black Jack 73.</i>

260
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:36,410
<i>We are en route with the package. Over.</i>

261
00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:40,750
<i>Copy that Black Jack 73.
What is your ETA?</i>

262
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:43,120
Eight hours, 30 minutes. Over.

263
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:46,370
<i>Roger that. We anxiously
await your arrival. Over and out.</i>

264
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:24,540
Yeah!

265
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:27,620
That's what I'm talking about!

266
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:33,040
<i>Ken, it appears
that you strained your rotator cuff</i>

267
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,540
<i>during the battle.</i>

268
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:37,580
That's what I get for saving lives.

269
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:41,000
<i>Ken, it is your duty to save lives.</i>

270
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Well, I prefer to save my arm
and leave the kaiju to the KDF.

271
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,160
<i>You know what happens
when you leave it to the KDF.</i>

272
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:52,830
Yeah. I have a double-double,
a chocolate shake,

273
00:16:52,830 --> 00:16:54,620
and a good night's sleep.

274
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:56,410
Now stop trying to be my mother.

275
00:16:56,410 --> 00:16:58,660
<i>I am as I was programmed.</i>

276
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:04,290
Coconut water?

277
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:07,540
Mina, did you throw out
my fancy fizzy drinks?

278
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:10,700
<i>Healthy choices, healthy body.</i>

279
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,040
Ugh.

280
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,580
Mmm.

281
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:20,250
This tastes just like a fart.

282
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:24,370
<i>Ken. I wonder if you might consider
taking a break.</i>

283
00:17:24,370 --> 00:17:25,790
From drinking farts?

284
00:17:25,790 --> 00:17:27,870
<i>From baseball.</i>

285
00:17:27,870 --> 00:17:30,830
Give up the one thing
that puts a smile on my face?

286
00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:33,200
Sorry. No.

287
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,790
TV, please.

288
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:39,120
<i>More destruction today
as the KDF and Ultraman battled Neronga.</i>

289
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,620
{\an8}<i>As one witness told us...</i>

290
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:43,660
{\an8}<i>I love Ultraman. Always have.</i>

291
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:46,330
{\an8}<i>He's done so much good in the past.</i>

292
00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:48,040
{\an8}Thank you, citizen.

293
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:50,410
{\an8}<i>But he's been gone for months.</i>

294
00:17:50,410 --> 00:17:52,620
{\an8}<i>And now that he's back,</i>

295
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:55,160
{\an8}<i>it's like he doesn't really care.</i>

296
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:57,290
{\an8}<i>I mean look at this.</i>

297
00:17:58,330 --> 00:18:00,120
I didn't even want this gig.

298
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:02,660
And now everybody's coming at me.

299
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:05,580
Shimura, the KDF, random grandmas.

300
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,120
Can we just please give Ultraman a rest?

301
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:13,790
<i>Yes, of course.</i>

302
00:18:14,910 --> 00:18:18,750
<i>Can't wait to see you
play tonight. So proud of you.</i>

303
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:23,040
<i>Who's number one?!
Who's number one?!</i>

304
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,870
<i>Kenji. I hope you're settling into Tokyo.</i>

305
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:31,790
<i>I know this isn't what you wanted,
but you're doing a very good thing.</i>

306
00:18:32,410 --> 00:18:36,160
<i>With his injury,
your father needs you, kiddo.</i>

307
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:41,250
<i>I just hope you two can find balance.</i>

308
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:44,080
<i>I'll always root for you.</i>

309
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:48,080
<i>Even if you play for the Giants.</i>

310
00:18:51,370 --> 00:18:56,000
Still no sightings or readings
from her GPS locator?

311
00:18:57,290 --> 00:18:59,290
<i>No, Ken, I'm sorry.</i>

312
00:18:59,290 --> 00:19:01,660
<i>Unfortunately, she's still presumed...</i>

313
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,290
<i>You did all you could.</i>

314
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,660
Mina, could you pull up an old game?

315
00:19:13,370 --> 00:19:14,580
<i>Of course, Ken.</i>

316
00:19:16,450 --> 00:19:18,450
<i>Go, Kenji!</i>

317
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:19,910
<i>Attaboy!</i>

318
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:26,500
<i>Kenji!</i>

319
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:29,000
<i>- Mom! I did it!
- </i> [Emiko] <i>That was amazing!</i>

320
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,450
<i>I can't believe how far you hit that!</i>

321
00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:34,080
<i>That's how we roll!</i>

322
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:41,410
<i>Welcome,
baseball fans, to opening day</i>

323
00:19:41,410 --> 00:19:45,790
<i>and a matchup between your Giants
and the visiting Swallows.</i>

324
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:52,910
Hey, Wakita,
heard you got a one-on-one with Sato.

325
00:19:52,910 --> 00:19:55,370
Inquiring minds want to know more.

326
00:19:55,370 --> 00:19:59,540
You know what, Kubo?
This is baseball, not gossip hour.

327
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:04,040
Yeah, I heard your little comment
at the press conference.

328
00:20:05,790 --> 00:20:08,450
<i>You can feel the electricity in the air.</i>

329
00:20:08,450 --> 00:20:11,120
<i>42,000 fans here tonight,</i>

330
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:15,950
<i>a capacity crowd waiting
to get their first look at Ken Sato,</i>

331
00:20:15,950 --> 00:20:20,080
<i>anxious to see what he can bring
to this Giants team.</i>

332
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:29,500
I can't believe
it's my first game with Ken Sato--

333
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:31,950
That's worth a lot on eBay, rook.

334
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:38,750
Hey, come on, smile.

335
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:41,250
I'm about to make you look really good.

336
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:44,160
<i>...rightfielder Ken Sato!</i>

337
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:52,830
Sato! Sato! Sato!

338
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,910
- Oh, Kenny.

339
00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:03,620
It's a shame about that shoulder.

340
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:05,950
Ooh! Just breaks my heart.

341
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,370
Strike one!
- Come on. Seriously?

342
00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:16,660
I guess "legends" are human too.

343
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:20,830
Let's go, Sato!

344
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:27,330
Strike two!

345
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:31,450
If only there was a Japanese version
of this guy.

346
00:21:31,450 --> 00:21:34,120
The Japanese version's
about to make you eat this bat!

347
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:35,290
Oh, yeah? You wanna go?

348
00:21:35,290 --> 00:21:38,330
Hey, all right, fellas.
Come on now. Break it up. Break it up!

349
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:42,120
<i>Vulture's Nest,
this is Black Jack 73.</i>

350
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:43,700
<i>ETA is 10 minutes.</i>

351
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:50,410
<i>Bottom of the first,
two strikes on Sato</i>

352
00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:52,500
<i>and he doesn't look happy.</i>

353
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:57,200
<i>And now it looks like
Ken Sato's gonna try something new.</i>

354
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,750
<i>He's gonna switch to batting right-handed.</i>

355
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:03,290
<i>You know, I've never seen this
in the middle of an at-bat.</i>

356
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:33,040
<i>And it's a grand slam!</i>

357
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:34,250
Yes!

358
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:39,000
Yes! Kenji!

359
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:57,000
Oh, my God.

360
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:07,790
<i>Black Jack 73,
pull up, pull up, go left--</i>

361
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:13,040
Look!

362
00:23:23,910 --> 00:23:25,290
Oh, my God.

363
00:23:36,370 --> 00:23:37,580
Gigantron.

364
00:23:55,410 --> 00:23:59,870
<i>Attention! Please proceed
immediately to the nearest emergency exit.</i>

365
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,000
<i>Repeat. Please proceed
to the nearest exit.</i>

366
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,160
<i>This is not a drill.</i>

367
00:24:11,290 --> 00:24:12,290
Hey!

368
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,580
That is for messing up my game.

369
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:35,750
Oh, crap.

370
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:58,790
Scramble all jets. Kill Gigantron.

371
00:24:58,790 --> 00:25:00,870
And retrieve the package.

372
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:13,200
What the hell?

373
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:16,450
<i>Ken,
you saw what the KDF did to Neronga.</i>

374
00:25:16,450 --> 00:25:19,500
<i>They will kill Gigantron
if you don't help.</i>

375
00:25:26,370 --> 00:25:29,040
<i>KDF Blue 14. Acquiring target.</i>

376
00:25:45,290 --> 00:25:47,160
<i>Vulture's Nest,
we are approaching--</i>

377
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:49,000
<i>Uh, are you seeing this?</i>

378
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,950
Hey! Guys!
Gigantron is actually flying away.

379
00:25:52,950 --> 00:25:54,870
So, I don't know, uh,

380
00:25:55,370 --> 00:25:57,750
maybe turn those birds around
and head on home.

381
00:25:58,450 --> 00:26:00,790
<i>If Ultraman interferes,</i>

382
00:26:00,790 --> 00:26:03,870
<i>you are authorized to use deadly force.</i>

383
00:26:12,410 --> 00:26:14,540
You see what I get
for trying to be the good guy?

384
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:16,870
<i>You're supposed to be the good guy.</i>

385
00:26:16,870 --> 00:26:19,080
Hey there, Mr. Gigantron.

386
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:20,410
- Whoa!

387
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:24,580
If you give me whatever that thing is,

388
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:29,290
those planes back there
might leave you alone.

389
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:39,040
Whoa!

390
00:26:43,910 --> 00:26:46,410
<i>Vulture's Nest,
Gigantron is in missile range.</i>

391
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:48,040
<i>Targeting.</i>

392
00:26:48,790 --> 00:26:50,370
<i>Holding fire. Ultraman's back.</i>

393
00:26:50,370 --> 00:26:53,790
Please!
They're going to kill you!

394
00:26:55,370 --> 00:26:56,910
Sir. We have target lock.

395
00:26:56,910 --> 00:26:59,950
<i>Ultraman may get caught
in the blast if we fire now, sir.</i>

396
00:26:59,950 --> 00:27:02,080
I don't care about Ultraman.

397
00:27:02,950 --> 00:27:04,910
Will the package survive the blast?

398
00:27:04,910 --> 00:27:05,830
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

399
00:27:05,830 --> 00:27:07,330
Then take the shot!

400
00:27:07,910 --> 00:27:09,330
Roger that. Fire.

401
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:16,160
<i>Danger. Take evasive ac--</i>

402
00:27:47,370 --> 00:27:50,160
<i>Ken. Are... Are you okay?</i>

403
00:29:14,830 --> 00:29:21,290
No. No, no, no, no, no.
Uh... No. No, no, no.

404
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:28,910
Oh.

405
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:14,540
Mina! Emergency analysis.

406
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:15,790
<i>Scanning for injuries.</i>

407
00:30:23,450 --> 00:30:26,540
<i>Ken, this is very strange.</i>

408
00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:28,830
<i>According to my readings, you have a...</i>

409
00:30:28,830 --> 00:30:29,830
<i>A second heartbeat?</i>

410
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:33,330
No.
It's not my heartbeat, Mina.

411
00:30:33,330 --> 00:30:36,120
<i>- </i> [Mina] <i>Oh, my God. Is that--
- </i>

412
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:38,450
Yep, it's the end of the world.

413
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:41,410
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa. Whoa.

414
00:30:43,450 --> 00:30:45,500
Um... Is it okay?

415
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:47,040
<i>"She," Ken.</i>

416
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,830
<i>The infant is a "she."</i>

417
00:30:49,410 --> 00:30:52,830
<i>Her breathing seems normal. Reflexes okay.</i>

418
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:56,450
<i>Heart rate seems slightly elevated, but--</i>

419
00:30:56,450 --> 00:30:58,080
Just give me the bad news.

420
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:02,040
<i>I have absolutely no specific data
on infant kaiju physiology.</i>

421
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:04,620
Wait, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

422
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:08,040
Didn't Mom and Dad program
everything they knew about these things

423
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:09,750
into your electric brain?

424
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:12,450
<i>She is not a thing, Ken.</i>

425
00:31:12,450 --> 00:31:15,200
<i>And we've never seen
an seen an infant kaiju.</i>

426
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,830
<i>In fact, no one has.</i>

427
00:31:16,830 --> 00:31:19,910
Great, super helpful.

428
00:31:19,910 --> 00:31:22,200
Yeah, I think
I'd be better off asking Siri.

429
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:25,290
<i>Ken, I'm not the one who brought
a giant baby kaiju home.</i>

430
00:31:25,290 --> 00:31:27,330
Uh,
we have to figure something out.

431
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:30,160
Great.

432
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:32,410
Um...

433
00:31:32,410 --> 00:31:35,950
- Why is she changing colors?
<i>- Maybe you should ask Siri.</i>

434
00:31:35,950 --> 00:31:38,410
Do not start, Mina.

435
00:31:38,410 --> 00:31:40,040
<i>If I were to guess, Ken,</i>

436
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:43,250
<i>I'd say she has imprinted on you.</i>

437
00:31:43,250 --> 00:31:45,620
No. No, no, no! No, no, no!

438
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:47,370
<i>- </i>  Are you saying--
<i>- Yes, Ken.</i>

439
00:31:47,370 --> 00:31:50,200
<i>She thinks you are her mother.</i>

440
00:31:50,790 --> 00:31:53,160
I am not built for this.

441
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:56,330
I've got a life. A title to win!

442
00:31:56,330 --> 00:31:59,120
You do something nice,
and now I'm babysitting

443
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:00,660
a giant pink lizard thing!

444
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:03,910
We've gotta get it out of here.

445
00:32:03,910 --> 00:32:06,290
<i>And where would you suggest
we take her, Ken?</i>

446
00:32:10,450 --> 00:32:14,290
Oh! Oh, oh, oh.
We'll take her to Kaiju Island!

447
00:32:14,290 --> 00:32:17,000
<i>Unfortunately, Ken,
no one knows where to find it.</i>

448
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,040
Come on!

449
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:19,620
<i>Neither your parents nor the KDF</i>

450
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:22,080
<i>- were ever able to locate the island.
- </i>

451
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:25,250
<i>Ken, it would be very bad
if you changed back right now.</i>

452
00:32:36,290 --> 00:32:37,290
Hi.

453
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,580
What the heck was that?!

454
00:32:48,370 --> 00:32:49,450
<i>She's scared of you.</i>

455
00:32:49,450 --> 00:32:52,410
Scared of <i>me?</i> She's 20 feet tall!

456
00:32:52,410 --> 00:32:56,200
<i>She doesn't know you.
She only knows Ultraman.</i>

457
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:58,790
Mina! Containment unit!

458
00:32:58,790 --> 00:32:59,700
<i>Which one?</i>

459
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:01,080
The biggest one!

460
00:33:12,910 --> 00:33:13,750
Oh, God.

461
00:33:15,870 --> 00:33:19,410
<i>Ken, there really is only one person
who could help.</i>

462
00:33:19,410 --> 00:33:22,790
Oh, no, no, no! You did not just suggest--

463
00:33:22,790 --> 00:33:24,950
<i>Sorry, Ken. I already called.</i>

464
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:30,790
<i>Kenji. It's your father.
Are you there? Hello?</i>

465
00:33:53,450 --> 00:33:56,540
My God. It hatched.

466
00:33:57,660 --> 00:34:01,500
Blanket the area.
Find the infant and bring it back alive.

467
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:07,950
Kenji.

468
00:34:07,950 --> 00:34:10,790
Dad, hey. Hey, what's up?

469
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:13,000
How about that game tonight?

470
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,660
Oh, thank God. You're okay?

471
00:34:15,660 --> 00:34:17,870
Yeah, you know, I'm, uh... good.

472
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:20,160
It was a tough battle.

473
00:34:20,660 --> 00:34:22,660
I'm a little sore, still recovering, but--

474
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,750
- What was that?

Uh, you know, it's...

476
00:34:28,620 --> 00:34:32,950
- Uh... That's the... The party downstairs.

477
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:37,660
The most magnificent creature
on Earth has died.

478
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:40,370
The last of its kind.

479
00:34:40,370 --> 00:34:41,870
And you throw a party?

480
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:48,200
That magnificent creature
nearly took my head off, Dad.

481
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:52,870
I've barely seen you in 20 years.

482
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:57,250
You chose this city
and literal monsters over us.

483
00:34:58,290 --> 00:35:00,910
- No.
- Then you get hurt, can't hack it anymore,

484
00:35:00,910 --> 00:35:03,660
and I get to come back
and clean up the mess you made as...

No. I only wanted to... protect you.

491
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:23,040
But you didn't.

492
00:35:23,790 --> 00:35:25,330
You didn't even pay attention.

493
00:35:29,250 --> 00:35:30,410
Be honest.

494
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:32,450
When Mom disappeared,

495
00:35:33,370 --> 00:35:34,830
did you even look for her?

496
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:45,870
We share the pain of her loss, Kenji.

497
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:50,000
I will leave you alone.

509
00:36:53,830 --> 00:36:54,950
Let's try this.

Before.

517

You see?

518
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:27,540
It's me.

519
00:37:33,290 --> 00:37:34,620
What now?

520
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:36,290

Do I look like I have any idea
what to feed a giant lizard baby?

523
00:37:48,830 --> 00:37:52,080
Mina, hurry, give her something
before she stomps another car.

524
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:53,160
<i>Of course, Ken.</i>

00:37:57,870 --> 00:37:58,790

Stop it right now.

531
00:38:18,910 --> 00:38:21,160
You are gonna be

532

What? What is it now?

533
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:36,830

00:39:37,620 --> 00:39:38,700
That's disgusting.

Oh. That smell.

Oh, God.

548

It's so bad.

549
00:39:52,580 --> 00:39:54,910
I shouldn't have
eaten all those donuts.

<i>Ken, I know you're exhausted.
But you have a game today.</i>

There's no way we're gonna play.

Of course.

555
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:12,910
Of course, we're still gonna play.

<i>What are we going to do
about the baby, Ken?</i>

557
00:40:15,620 --> 00:40:17,790
<i>We</i> aren't gonna do anything.

Get creative, Mina.

00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:24,830
You are a state-of-the-art supercomputer.

Ah! TV, the ultimate babysitter.

563
00:40:35,910 --> 00:40:37,700
Just not this crap all day, okay?

564
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:40,410
I don't want her getting hooked
on that stupid song.

565
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:46,080
<i>And there's another strike.</i>

566
00:40:46,870 --> 00:40:49,370
<i>Sato just looks exhausted.</i>

567
00:40:50,950 --> 00:40:54,870
<i>And now it looks like
there are words being exchanged</i>

568

<i>between Sato and the Swallows catcher.</i>

569

{\an8}<i>Oh! Oh, no.</i>

570
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:04,910
{\an8}<i>We haven't seen a brawl like this
in a long time.</i>

571
00:41:04,910 --> 00:41:08,200
<i>Both benches have cleared.
They're throwing punches...</i>

572
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:12,250
<i>Ken,
we have something to show you.</i>

573
00:41:32,790 --> 00:41:35,120
I need some good news, Mina.

574
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:38,000
Please tell me you found Kaiju Island.

575

<i>No, Ken,</i>

576
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:42,290
<i>but the baby has a surprise for you.</i>

577
00:41:53,540 --> 00:41:56,200
Ugh!

578
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:59,660
Dear God, what... What is that smell?

579
00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:03,580
<i>Ken, you cannot feed a 20-foot baby
a half ton of fish</i>

580
00:42:03,580 --> 00:42:06,250
<i>and expect anything but a giant pile of--</i>

581

<i>Which brings me to something
we need to discuss.</i>

582
00:42:12,910 --> 00:42:18,040
<i>Until I'm able to find Kaiju Island,
we're going to need to raise her.</i>

583
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:21,330
Mina, I've got a whole season
of baseball ahead of me.

584
00:42:21,830 --> 00:42:22,910
I just can't do it.

585
00:42:22,910 --> 00:42:26,200
<i>Ken, you brought her home
and now she is your responsibility.</i>

586
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:28,540
<i>She'll die if you don't take care of her.</i>

587

00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:47,790
If you want to set the record straight--

635
00:46:47,790 --> 00:46:51,410
Could we just chat? Like, off the record?

636
00:46:51,410 --> 00:46:54,120
Whoo! Schuwatch!

637
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:55,500
Take that, Gazoto!

638
00:46:55,500 --> 00:46:58,080
I'm really busy right now... Put that down!

639
00:46:58,080 --> 00:47:01,120
Boom! Scatter drones!

640
00:47:01,120 --> 00:47:04,790
<i>It's just... You're the only person
who'll talk to me.</i>

641
00:47:04,790 --> 00:47:06,410
- Zoom!

642
00:47:07,660 --> 00:47:10,290
I'll make you a deal.
You get five minutes.

643
00:47:10,830 --> 00:47:14,160
- Yes!
<i>- But you have to give me a follow-up.</i>

644
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:15,750
<i>A real interview this time.</i>

645
00:47:15,750 --> 00:47:18,120
Done. Whenever you want.

646
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:21,290
<i>Okay, we are off the record.</i>

647
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:26,000
Please Mina, keep her busy.

648
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:29,160
<i>Ken? You still there?</i>

649
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:30,830
Yep. I'm here. I'm here.

650
00:47:31,450 --> 00:47:34,950
So, what's the secret?

651
00:47:34,950 --> 00:47:38,000
How... How do you do it? Juggle everything.

652
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,500
Your job, your kid?

653
00:47:41,250 --> 00:47:44,750
Don't you ever just want
to jump out a window?

654
00:47:45,830 --> 00:47:48,700
Ken, do you have a secret love child?

655
00:47:48,700 --> 00:47:50,950
Because <i>that</i> would be a story.

656
00:47:50,950 --> 00:47:56,160
Uh, no. Just, uh, curious.

657
00:47:56,160 --> 00:48:01,540
Honestly, it's not easy, Ken.
They're like little monsters sometimes.

658
00:48:01,540 --> 00:48:03,000
Whoa.

659
00:48:04,830 --> 00:48:05,750
Mama!

660
00:48:08,870 --> 00:48:11,500
But they can surprise you too.

661
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:14,700
They have hearts and minds of their own.

662
00:48:14,700 --> 00:48:19,750
They're trying to discover who they are
and what they want.

663
00:48:22,370 --> 00:48:25,120
<i>And the only support they have is us.</i>

664
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:29,290
Imperfect, messed up us,

665
00:48:29,290 --> 00:48:31,040
dealing with our own issues,

666
00:48:31,660 --> 00:48:34,410
<i>trying to figure out who the heck we are.</i>

667
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:38,250
<i>And you know what?
That's the beauty of it.</i>

668
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:40,790
<i>I look at my daughter sometimes</i>

669
00:48:40,790 --> 00:48:45,660
<i>and think that I'm learning
as much from her as she is from me.</i>

670
00:48:48,870 --> 00:48:50,160
Amazing.

671
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:53,000
<i>Yep, they sure are.</i>

672
00:48:54,450 --> 00:48:56,330
Lower the containment unit.

673
00:49:00,410 --> 00:49:02,160
<i>And before you know it,</i>

674
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:06,290
<i>she won't be interested in toys
and your heart will break.</i>

675
00:49:08,500 --> 00:49:11,580
<i>I'm sure you have no idea
what I'm talking about, Ken.</i>

676
00:49:13,580 --> 00:49:16,200
<i>Ken? Ken?</i>

677
00:49:17,250 --> 00:49:21,290
<i>And your five minutes is up.
You gonna honor your part of the deal?</i>

678
00:49:21,290 --> 00:49:23,910
Oh, uh, yeah, yeah. Uh, tomorrow night?

679
00:49:23,910 --> 00:49:26,700
Um, sure.

680
00:49:26,700 --> 00:49:28,450
Great. Tonkatsu Tonki.

681
00:49:28,450 --> 00:49:30,620
<i>- 7:00? Bye.
- </i>

682
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:41,370
Uh, Mina? Load up a park.

683
00:49:41,370 --> 00:49:44,040
Maybe start her out
in one of the older simulations.

684
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:45,040
Something easy.

685
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:47,000
<i>I have just the thing.</i>

686
00:50:00,120 --> 00:50:01,500
Go, Kenji!

687
00:50:04,790 --> 00:50:06,910
Nice touch, Mina.

688
00:50:07,660 --> 00:50:09,700
Okay, just like this.

689
00:50:12,080 --> 00:50:13,040
Elbows up.

690
00:50:14,120 --> 00:50:14,950
Uh-huh.

691
00:50:15,660 --> 00:50:16,910
Get ready.

692
00:50:17,500 --> 00:50:19,330
Okay, here it comes.

693
00:50:25,830 --> 00:50:26,790
No! No, no, no, no.

694
00:50:26,790 --> 00:50:28,790
Hey, it's okay. It's okay.

695
00:50:29,700 --> 00:50:33,040
It happens sometimes.
You just gotta work at it.

696
00:50:36,290 --> 00:50:39,620
Now get ready
and keep your eye on the ball.

697
00:50:40,250 --> 00:50:44,290
<i>Ichi, ni, san,</i> ball.

698
00:50:48,290 --> 00:50:52,160
- Whoa! Yes! Whoo!
<i>- Yay!</i>

699
00:50:53,250 --> 00:50:55,790
Come on, girl! We gotta run the bases!

700
00:50:57,120 --> 00:50:58,370
Like this. Come on!

701
00:51:00,450 --> 00:51:01,870
Yeah!

702
00:51:32,290 --> 00:51:35,040
Mina we've got plenty of fish
and Pon de Rings, right?

703
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:37,080
<i>Yes, Ken. We're all stocked up.</i>

704
00:51:38,410 --> 00:51:40,790
Now, if she wakes up, put her show on.

705
00:51:40,790 --> 00:51:43,370
Let her dance her little heart out
to that stupid song.

706
00:51:43,370 --> 00:51:46,290
And if there's any trouble,
you ping me on this, got it?

707
00:51:47,080 --> 00:51:50,790
<i>Ken. She's never been safer.
Have a good time.</i>

708
00:51:58,410 --> 00:51:59,750
<i>- Itadakimasu!
- Itadakimasu!</i>

709
00:52:05,830 --> 00:52:07,000
Mmm.

710
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,500
- Right?
- Mmm. Amazing!

711
00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:11,080
Did you just find this place?

712
00:52:11,080 --> 00:52:12,950
Mmm. It's an old family spot.

713
00:52:12,950 --> 00:52:15,580
Mom would bring me here
when Dad had to, uh...

714
00:52:16,790 --> 00:52:18,870
work late.

715
00:52:19,450 --> 00:52:22,330
Have you spoken with him
since you've been back?

716
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:26,540
Not really. He and I don't, uh...

717
00:52:29,830 --> 00:52:30,870
Uh-uh.

718
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:35,330
Nah. Ichiro warned me
that you could get the devil himself

719
00:52:35,330 --> 00:52:36,830
to confess his sins.

720
00:52:36,830 --> 00:52:40,410
It's my job to get people to confess.

721
00:52:41,080 --> 00:52:44,080
And you agreed to this
during our little domestic chat.

722
00:52:46,540 --> 00:52:48,080
You gonna run away again?

723
00:52:48,830 --> 00:52:49,790
I'll try not to.

724
00:52:50,370 --> 00:52:51,250
Great.

725
00:52:52,080 --> 00:52:53,500
Then stop staring at your watch

726
00:52:53,500 --> 00:52:55,700
and tell me why you don't
talk to your dad.

727
00:53:11,410 --> 00:53:15,000
<i>Well, look who woke up.
You want to see Daddy?</i>

728
00:53:16,580 --> 00:53:17,620
<i>Here you go.</i>

729
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,500
<i>How about a snack while you watch?</i>

730
00:53:36,290 --> 00:53:37,500
<i>Oh, my!</i>

731
00:53:37,500 --> 00:53:41,000
<i>What you're experiencing
is called acid reflux.</i>

732
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,620
<i>Symptoms include heartburn, nausea--</i>

733
00:53:47,500 --> 00:53:50,500
<i>- Oh, no.</i>

734
00:53:52,500 --> 00:53:55,410
Why are you so laser-focused on me?

735
00:53:55,410 --> 00:53:57,790
Because there's something different
about you.

736
00:53:58,750 --> 00:54:00,200
I don't know what it is yet.

737
00:54:00,700 --> 00:54:03,250
Things you've said, things you haven't.

738
00:54:03,950 --> 00:54:05,750
But I've done this long enough to know.

739
00:54:05,750 --> 00:54:08,910
And when I know, I'm like a pitbull.

740
00:54:09,750 --> 00:54:10,790
I don't let go.

741
00:54:11,660 --> 00:54:13,160
Sounds like my mom.

742
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:17,200
So, um, tell me.

743
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:18,410
How am I different?

744
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:25,040
Okay, during our last interview,
you said that kids made fun of you,

745
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,250
so you gave them
something else to talk about.

746
00:54:29,250 --> 00:54:30,830
You didn't like what they said,

747
00:54:30,830 --> 00:54:33,160
but you didn't mind
that they were talking.

748
00:54:34,870 --> 00:54:35,870
Go on.

749
00:54:35,870 --> 00:54:38,950
Your mother was very supportive,
came to all the games.

750
00:54:39,750 --> 00:54:42,750
But I think it was hard
not having your dad around.

751
00:54:43,660 --> 00:54:48,200
You wanted him there
to rescue you, to protect you.

752
00:54:49,410 --> 00:54:53,330
All the accolades, the money,
you don't really care about that.

753
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:55,160
It's the attention.

754
00:54:56,500 --> 00:55:01,580
More than anything in the world,
you want <i>him</i> to notice.

755
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:10,290
<i>Look over here. Look at Daddy.
He's right here.</i>

756
00:55:16,370 --> 00:55:19,870
<i>There you go. That's a good girl.</i>

757
00:55:21,660 --> 00:55:23,910
<i>Careful.</i>

758
00:55:26,370 --> 00:55:27,450
<i>That's not good.</i>

759
00:55:37,080 --> 00:55:40,580
<i>No, you shall remain in this area.</i>

760
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:50,830
<i>Requesting compliance.</i>

761
00:55:50,830 --> 00:55:53,000
<i>Please return to your designated area.</i>

762
00:55:53,750 --> 00:55:55,120
<i>No. Do not do that.</i>

763
00:55:56,910 --> 00:55:59,250
<i>Daddy will not be happy
with all this damage.</i>

764
00:56:02,500 --> 00:56:06,040
<i>Main entrance breach.
Main entrance breach.</i>

765
00:56:06,040 --> 00:56:10,200
The world ain't gonna explode
if you show a little vulnerability.

766
00:56:10,830 --> 00:56:14,620
The fans don't expect you to be Ultraman.

767
00:56:17,660 --> 00:56:19,830
Do you need to get that?

768
00:56:22,080 --> 00:56:24,330
Oh, my God!

769
00:56:24,330 --> 00:56:27,660
Ami, I'm so so sorry.
It's a family emergency.

770
00:56:34,450 --> 00:56:36,950
<i>Hey, you gotta take care of you.</i>

771
00:56:37,500 --> 00:56:39,700
<i>Coco7. Premium.</i>

772
00:56:42,790 --> 00:56:45,160
<i>Healthy choices, healthy body.</i>

773
00:56:59,950 --> 00:57:02,200
<i>Healthy choices, healthy body.</i>

774
00:57:22,830 --> 00:57:26,000
<i>Ken, a disturbance
has been reported in Daikanyama.</i>

775
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:30,620
<i>There seems to be a large,
pink creature terrorizing the locals.</i>

776
00:57:30,620 --> 00:57:32,540
No, God, no.

777
00:57:32,540 --> 00:57:35,250
<i>I am sorry. I'm a terrible babysitter.</i>

778
00:57:35,250 --> 00:57:36,870
Yes. Yes, you are.

779
00:57:55,580 --> 00:57:58,830
Scramble the attack squadron
and ready my ship.

780
00:57:59,410 --> 00:58:00,580
<i>Roger that, sir.</i>

781
00:58:10,450 --> 00:58:12,660
<i>Airship 5,
you are clear for takeoff.</i>

782
00:58:27,660 --> 00:58:30,790
<i>Ken, I've located her.
She's not far from you.</i>

783
00:58:30,790 --> 00:58:33,250
- Maybe I can get to her before--

784
00:58:33,250 --> 00:58:34,160
Oh, no, no!

785
00:58:43,870 --> 00:58:46,120
Oh, my gosh, it's Ultragirl!

786
00:58:46,120 --> 00:58:47,040
Mama!

787
00:58:49,450 --> 00:58:51,700
You couldn't get her
to give the mask a break?

788
00:58:51,700 --> 00:58:53,500
Nope, stubborn as you.

789
00:58:54,870 --> 00:58:57,120
So, your plans changed?

790
00:58:57,120 --> 00:59:00,450
Yep. Looks like it's a night out
with my girls.

791
00:59:00,450 --> 00:59:02,200
Wanna grab some ice cream?

792
00:59:02,200 --> 00:59:03,250
Yeah!

793
00:59:03,250 --> 00:59:06,330
Or does our little superhero
need to keep an eye out for--

794
00:59:06,330 --> 00:59:08,950
- A kaiju!

795
00:59:08,950 --> 00:59:11,750
It's okay, Mama. I'll protect you.

796
00:59:11,750 --> 00:59:12,870
Schuwatch!

797
00:59:12,870 --> 00:59:13,950
Run!

798
00:59:13,950 --> 00:59:15,950
A kaiju!

799
00:59:21,410 --> 00:59:22,330
Oh, no.

800
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:28,000
Okay.

801
00:59:35,330 --> 00:59:38,250
Hey, come on. Come on.

802
00:59:39,450 --> 00:59:41,910
Come to, uh... Daddy.

803
00:59:41,910 --> 00:59:43,160
Oh!

804
00:59:44,200 --> 00:59:46,160
Uh, I mean...

805
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:48,620
Stop there, beast.

806
00:59:52,950 --> 00:59:55,790
No. No. No.

807
00:59:59,660 --> 01:00:03,620
Uh, Mina. We've got a situation.
Baby just melted Pac-Man.

808
01:00:04,830 --> 01:00:07,160
<i>She has acid reflux.</i>

809
01:00:07,160 --> 01:00:09,370
Babies get acid reflux?

810
01:00:10,410 --> 01:00:11,540
Where's baby?

811
01:00:54,580 --> 01:00:56,660
<i>Tastes just like a home run.</i>

812
01:01:21,660 --> 01:01:23,700
Hey, watch out!
- Sorry.

813
01:01:28,410 --> 01:01:29,750
Not good.

814
01:01:30,910 --> 01:01:35,410
Where's baby? There she is!

815
01:01:35,410 --> 01:01:39,080
Come down, right now. Be careful!

816
01:01:39,080 --> 01:01:40,870
<i>I don't think she's listening.</i>

817
01:01:40,870 --> 01:01:42,660
Thanks for the observation.

818
01:01:43,160 --> 01:01:46,120
No, no. This is not playtime.

819
01:01:46,660 --> 01:01:48,790
You get down from there right now,
young lady.

820
01:01:50,040 --> 01:01:54,200
<i>There they are.
Remember, tranquilizers only this time.</i>

821
01:02:03,370 --> 01:02:05,500
- No. No!

822
01:02:15,080 --> 01:02:16,700
Hang on! I'm coming!

823
01:02:17,700 --> 01:02:18,700
No!

824
01:02:19,700 --> 01:02:20,580
Baby!

825
01:02:24,540 --> 01:02:26,330
No. No, no, no.

826
01:02:27,290 --> 01:02:32,580
Shh. It's okay. You're gonna be okay.
Daddy's here.

827
01:02:33,620 --> 01:02:37,700
<i>Ultraman,
turn the infant over to the KDF</i>

828
01:02:37,700 --> 01:02:40,580
<i>and we will take no action against you.</i>

829
01:02:52,410 --> 01:02:54,000
Mina, she's hurt!

830
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:57,290
Uh, prep the base. We have to call him.

831
01:02:57,290 --> 01:02:59,500
Call my dad.

832
01:03:10,620 --> 01:03:14,660
Dad, I'm not asking
for complaints, guilt, or criticism.

833
01:03:14,660 --> 01:03:18,160
Not right now. I just... I need your help.

834
01:03:36,330 --> 01:03:37,160
Oh!

835
01:03:37,700 --> 01:03:40,040
Incredible.

836
01:03:42,040 --> 01:03:43,290
She's hurt, Dad.

837
01:03:43,290 --> 01:03:46,080
We were attacked. I don't know what to do.

838
01:03:46,870 --> 01:03:49,790
She... She got loose.
I should have been there.

839
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:52,700
- Shh.

840
01:03:53,040 --> 01:03:55,000
Dad, please! Careful with her.

841
01:03:56,700 --> 01:04:00,200
It's okay. He's not gonna hurt you.

842
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:02,450
- Shh.

843
01:04:03,250 --> 01:04:04,500
It's okay.

844
01:04:04,500 --> 01:04:06,250
<i>Good to see you again, Professor.</i>

845
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:08,290
Hello, Mina.

846
01:04:08,290 --> 01:04:09,450
<i>It's been a while.</i>

847
01:04:10,410 --> 01:04:11,660
Yes, it has.

848
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:14,830
Uh, can you do me a favor?

849
01:04:14,830 --> 01:04:17,160
Can you run a chem analysis on this?

850
01:04:17,160 --> 01:04:18,660
<i>Yes, of course.</i>

851
01:04:25,620 --> 01:04:27,870
I'm here. I'm right here.

852
01:04:29,290 --> 01:04:31,410
Dad, do something.

853
01:04:32,250 --> 01:04:33,120
Help her.

854
01:04:36,040 --> 01:04:38,870
Mina, it looks like
she might have a broken arm.

855
01:04:39,660 --> 01:04:40,700
Can you confirm?

856
01:04:40,700 --> 01:04:42,200
<i>Yes, that's correct.</i>

857
01:04:42,200 --> 01:04:45,290
<i>She has a mid-humeral fracture
with associated hematoma.</i>

858
01:04:45,290 --> 01:04:47,500
It's okay, you're okay.

859
01:04:47,500 --> 01:04:50,330
<i>I have completed the chem analysis,
Professor Sato.</i>

860
01:04:50,330 --> 01:04:53,830
<i>It's a powerful sedative,
but it's harmless.</i>

861
01:04:53,830 --> 01:04:56,370
Can you synthesize 100 ccs?

862
01:04:56,370 --> 01:04:57,830
<i>Yes, Professor.</i>

863
01:04:57,830 --> 01:05:00,290
Good. We'll need more.

864
01:05:00,290 --> 01:05:01,830
More? For what?

865
01:05:01,830 --> 01:05:05,370
Kenji, you may not agree with me
on anything else,

866
01:05:05,370 --> 01:05:08,450
but right now,
I'm the best chance she has,

867
01:05:08,950 --> 01:05:12,000
so please, please, just let me help.

868
01:05:13,660 --> 01:05:14,580
Okay.

869
01:05:22,620 --> 01:05:25,040
Dad. Bunny?

870
01:05:25,040 --> 01:05:27,250
It always worked on you.

871
01:05:33,370 --> 01:05:39,000
<i>♪ B-i-n-g-o, b-i-n-g-o ♪</i>

872
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:42,040
Okay, now hold her steady, Kenji.

873
01:05:42,040 --> 01:05:46,160
<i>♪ B-i-n-g-o ♪</i>

874

877
01:06:03,330 --> 01:06:05,500
<i>Akiko, say hi to Daddy.</i>

878
01:06:05,500 --> 01:06:07,200
<i>Hi, Daddy!</i>

879
01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:09,580
<i>I see you, Daddy, I see you.</i>

880
01:06:10,750 --> 01:06:12,750
<i>- What's that, Mama?
- Get down!</i>

881
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:23,660
Sorry for the intrusion, sir.

882
01:06:24,200 --> 01:06:28,120
My deepest apologies
for failing to capture the infant.

883
01:06:29,750 --> 01:06:31,250
It's all right, Captain.

884
01:06:32,040 --> 01:06:34,330
We learned something
very important tonight.

885
01:06:35,330 --> 01:06:36,660
Watch this.

886
01:06:40,700 --> 01:06:42,080
As I'd suspected,

887
01:06:42,080 --> 01:06:46,700
the infant has the ability to echolocate
to find her way,

888
01:06:47,410 --> 01:06:50,910
meaning, eventually,
she'll want to go home.

889
01:06:50,910 --> 01:06:55,080
And when she does,
we will track her back to Kaiju Island

890
01:06:55,080 --> 01:06:56,790
and destroy them all.

891
01:07:02,120 --> 01:07:03,620
You question my methods?

892
01:07:04,500 --> 01:07:07,450
Sir, I'm sorry.
I wholeheartedly believe in our mission,

893
01:07:07,450 --> 01:07:10,330
but... is there no other way?

894
01:07:13,580 --> 01:07:16,080
Your compassion is admirable, Captain.

895
01:07:18,500 --> 01:07:22,120
You have children. A boy and a girl. Yes?

896
01:07:22,950 --> 01:07:24,750
They're my world, sir.

897
01:07:25,870 --> 01:07:27,790
Family is everything.

898
01:07:31,500 --> 01:07:35,450
I would do anything to have one more day
with my wife and daughter.

899
01:07:36,580 --> 01:07:37,540
Anything.

900
01:07:39,540 --> 01:07:41,290
I don't enjoy this task.

901
01:07:41,950 --> 01:07:45,700
I am a scientist after all, not a hunter.

902
01:07:46,660 --> 01:07:49,500
But I've learned
that hard decisions must be made

903
01:07:49,500 --> 01:07:51,000
to protect those we love.

904
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:54,080
Understand?

905
01:07:56,580 --> 01:07:57,750
Yes, sir.

906
01:07:58,870 --> 01:08:01,750
Captain, you look exhausted.

907
01:08:01,750 --> 01:08:03,290
Go home to your family.

908
01:08:03,290 --> 01:08:06,870
Get some rest and we will
resume the search in the morning.

909
01:08:06,870 --> 01:08:09,160
Thank you, sir. Have a good night.

910
01:08:58,080 --> 01:08:59,160
Bad habit.

911
01:09:05,790 --> 01:09:08,870
I'd say we did pretty well
considering the circumstances.

912
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:10,870
Dad, I...

913
01:09:10,870 --> 01:09:13,620
I really appreciate you showing up, I do.

914
01:09:13,620 --> 01:09:17,330
But this doesn't make you Ultradad.

915
01:09:18,040 --> 01:09:21,250
You know, we're not
suddenly gonna be best pals.

916
01:09:28,500 --> 01:09:31,290
Kenji, I need to show you something.

917
01:09:32,200 --> 01:09:33,370
Mina, news, please.

918
01:09:34,790 --> 01:09:38,330
{\an8}<i>Fortunately, the KDF
was able to contain the damage</i>

919
01:09:38,330 --> 01:09:39,620
<i>and no one was harmed.</i>

920
01:09:40,330 --> 01:09:42,000
<i>But the kaiju escaped</i>

921
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:46,540
{\an8}<i>and it would appear that Ultraman
is actually defending the beast.</i>

922
01:09:47,250 --> 01:09:52,450
{\an8}<i>The KDF are conducting a massive search
for both the creature and Ultraman.</i>

923
01:09:52,450 --> 01:09:54,910
{\an8}<i>We will protect the families of this city.</i>

924
01:09:54,910 --> 01:09:59,410
{\an8}<i>We will get to the bottom of this
and we will eliminate the threat.</i>

925
01:10:00,160 --> 01:10:03,120
Kenji, I've been tracking Onda.

926
01:10:03,120 --> 01:10:07,450
And until now he's been content on just
killing whatever kaiju attack the city.

927
01:10:08,450 --> 01:10:10,120
But something's changed.

928
01:10:10,750 --> 01:10:14,790
He wasn't trying to kill the baby.
He wanted her alive.

929
01:10:18,200 --> 01:10:20,620
I've known Onda for a long time.

930
01:10:21,540 --> 01:10:24,620
He is brilliant. He is cunning.

931
01:10:24,620 --> 01:10:26,290
And he will never stop,

932
01:10:27,040 --> 01:10:31,200
not until she's captured and you're dead.

933
01:10:35,120 --> 01:10:38,370
<i>♪ B-i-n-g-o ♪</i>

934
01:10:38,370 --> 01:10:42,410
<i>♪ And Bingo was his name-o ♪</i>

935
01:10:42,410 --> 01:10:47,040
You and I
don't have to be best pals.

936
01:10:47,040 --> 01:10:50,790
But can we at least agree
that she is the priority?

937
01:10:51,700 --> 01:10:53,750
Yes. She is.

938
01:10:54,830 --> 01:10:56,910
Okay, good.

939
01:10:58,660 --> 01:11:00,450
Do you have a plan?

940
01:11:00,450 --> 01:11:03,290
<i>We thought returning the baby
to her natural habitat</i>

941
01:11:03,290 --> 01:11:05,330
<i>would be best, Professor Sato.</i>

942
01:11:05,330 --> 01:11:08,330
<i>But the location of Kaiju Island
remains elusive.</i>

943
01:11:09,080 --> 01:11:13,000
Even if we could find it,
without a mother to defend her,

944
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:16,620
the baby might starve, drown,
die of hypothermia.

945
01:11:16,620 --> 01:11:18,750
Another kaiju could eat her as a snack--

946
01:11:18,750 --> 01:11:20,370
I got it. I got it.

947
01:11:23,160 --> 01:11:27,000
We have to raise her
the way her mother would have.

948
01:11:29,870 --> 01:11:33,290
So you're suggesting
that you and I, Ultraman...

949
01:11:34,080 --> 01:11:37,370
Ultramen, guys who are supposed
to fight these things,

950
01:11:37,370 --> 01:11:41,870
should train this baby
to essentially kick our butts?

951
01:11:43,580 --> 01:11:46,200
Kenji, she needs us.

952
01:11:50,160 --> 01:11:55,330
Come on. Stand up.
We have to measure you.

953
01:11:55,330 --> 01:11:58,830
<i>And analyze
your entire genetic makeup.</i>

954
01:11:59,870 --> 01:12:01,620
What are you doing?

955
01:12:02,370 --> 01:12:06,790
We need to examine her
so that we can plan a training regimen

956
01:12:06,790 --> 01:12:09,750
to protect Emi from predators.

957
01:12:10,620 --> 01:12:12,450
Emi? But, uh, wait.

958
01:12:12,450 --> 01:12:14,370
You named her after Mom?

959
01:12:15,160 --> 01:12:16,830
I think she would approve.

960
01:12:17,790 --> 01:12:19,660
Okay now, Emi.

961
01:12:19,660 --> 01:12:23,000
Stand up nice and tall.

962
01:12:25,660 --> 01:12:28,040
My God, my dad is a kaiju whisperer.

963
01:12:28,870 --> 01:12:32,790
Mina, please prepare to insert
the micro tracking device.

964
01:12:34,500 --> 01:12:37,290
Emi, can you do like Bunny?

965
01:12:43,370 --> 01:12:45,000
Good girl.

966
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:46,870
Mina, treat, please.

967
01:12:48,250 --> 01:12:53,120
And before we eat,
we always say, <i>"Itadakimasu!"</i>

968
01:12:55,910 --> 01:12:59,080
<i>Professor Sato, I believe
that Emi is experiencing</i>

969
01:12:59,080 --> 01:13:01,160
<i>a bit of nausea from the medicine.</i>

970
01:13:01,160 --> 01:13:04,330
Uh, Dad, step away. Seriously.

971
01:13:04,330 --> 01:13:05,450
Oh, she's fine.

972
01:13:06,370 --> 01:13:07,700
<i>Itadaki--</i>

973
01:13:09,660 --> 01:13:10,750
<i>Masu.</i>

974
01:13:14,910 --> 01:13:17,500
Get back here right now, missy!

975
01:13:19,870 --> 01:13:22,910
<i>That's another loss
for the Giants, making it six in a row.</i>

976
01:14:15,500 --> 01:14:17,580
{\an8}<i>Climbing back into contention,</i>

977
01:14:17,580 --> 01:14:20,620
{\an8}<i>the Giants are now just one game
out of first place.</i>

978
01:14:22,080 --> 01:14:23,910
<i>The Giants
are really coming together,</i>

979
01:14:23,910 --> 01:14:26,000
<i>thanks to a more mature Ken Sato.</i>

980
01:14:26,620 --> 01:14:27,580
Safe!

981
01:14:34,620 --> 01:14:36,660
<i>We're going to the playoffs!</i>

982
01:14:36,660 --> 01:14:40,950
<i>Sato's home run clinches a playoff spot
for the Giants.</i>

983
01:14:40,950 --> 01:14:43,450
<i>I have never seen a turnaround
quite like it.</i>

984
01:14:43,450 --> 01:14:46,000
<i>I don't know
what's happening with Sato,</i>

985
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,370
<i>but something has changed for the better.</i>

986
01:14:48,370 --> 01:14:52,790
<i>Not only is he shining on the field,
but he has brought this team together.</i>

987
01:15:12,500 --> 01:15:15,660
I thought it would be good
for all of us to get out of the house.

988
01:15:18,370 --> 01:15:20,160
It's exactly the same.

989
01:15:26,700 --> 01:15:28,500
Haven't been in a few weeks.

990
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,000
So many great memories here.

991
01:15:36,950 --> 01:15:40,500
I repurposed it into a bit of a lab
after you moved away.

992
01:15:51,160 --> 01:15:54,790
{\an8}You know your mom.
She could never sit still.

993
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:58,290
You did search for her.

994
01:15:59,870 --> 01:16:00,790
Yes.

995
01:16:01,870 --> 01:16:03,160
God, I miss her.

996
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,950
Her heart, her passion for life.

997
01:16:07,790 --> 01:16:10,750
She showed me what it means to be human.

998
01:16:12,540 --> 01:16:14,250
I'm so sorry, Dad.

999
01:16:29,200 --> 01:16:30,910
She sent me those.

1000
01:16:31,450 --> 01:16:33,700
And tapes of all your games.

1001
01:16:36,870 --> 01:16:38,620
Do you remember the '02 series?

1002
01:16:39,200 --> 01:16:42,200
A clear night. Outfield seats.

1003
01:16:42,200 --> 01:16:44,660
Matsui was unbelievable.

1004
01:16:49,620 --> 01:16:51,830
What? I thought I'd lost it.

1005
01:16:51,830 --> 01:16:55,540
I'll never forget the look
on your face when I caught it.

1006
01:16:55,540 --> 01:16:57,500
You cheered like a maniac

1007
01:16:57,500 --> 01:17:00,080
every time Matsui knocked one
out of the park.

1008
01:17:00,080 --> 01:17:04,830
I thought if somebody could do that
with a bat and a ball,

1009
01:17:05,620 --> 01:17:07,830
get your attention, make you smile...

1010
01:17:08,450 --> 01:17:11,290
Well, then that was something
I needed to do.

1011
01:17:12,330 --> 01:17:15,040
Hmm. That was the best day of my life.

1012
01:17:16,830 --> 01:17:20,500
Yes, but it was just one day.

1013
01:17:29,540 --> 01:17:30,410
Wanna play?

1014
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:35,000
And it's a grand slam!

1015
01:17:36,370 --> 01:17:37,540
Yeah!

1016
01:17:37,540 --> 01:17:41,040
- The crowd goes wild.
- That's the way, Emi!

1017
01:17:41,040 --> 01:17:42,700
And she's safe!

1018
01:17:44,620 --> 01:17:46,580
Great job, Emi!

1019
01:17:47,750 --> 01:17:50,370
It's okay. You guys can just keep playing.

1020
01:17:57,080 --> 01:18:00,330
<i>Emi, I can't believe
how far you hit that.</i>

1021
01:18:01,580 --> 01:18:03,410
You did a very good thing, Kenji.

1022
01:18:04,750 --> 01:18:06,580
<i>We</i> did a good thing, Dad.

1023
01:18:07,620 --> 01:18:10,870
- I couldn't have done this without you.
<i>- Hey! Wait for me.</i>

1024
01:18:13,080 --> 01:18:14,000
Very nice.

1025
01:18:17,750 --> 01:18:18,620
Dad?

1026
01:18:20,080 --> 01:18:23,370
Did you ever worry
that your power wasn't enough?

1027
01:18:24,790 --> 01:18:27,660
That you couldn't protect us?

1028
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,620
Every single day.

1029
01:18:34,830 --> 01:18:38,370
When I went into battle,
I never knew what would happen.

1030
01:18:38,370 --> 01:18:40,120
Whether I'd live or die,

1031
01:18:40,120 --> 01:18:42,750
whether I could keep you
and your mother safe.

1032
01:18:46,830 --> 01:18:48,500
I know it wasn't easy, Kenji,

1033
01:18:49,250 --> 01:18:50,330
moving away,

1034
01:18:51,580 --> 01:18:52,750
building a new life.

1035
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:55,500
And now this.

1036
01:18:57,200 --> 01:18:58,080
I'm so sorry.

1037
01:19:00,250 --> 01:19:03,200
It's actually kind of cool
turning into a giant superhero.

1038
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:05,830
It's just, uh...

1039
01:19:06,700 --> 01:19:09,450
I'm... I'm not very good at it.

1040
01:19:12,370 --> 01:19:14,330
Do you remember Gomora?

1041
01:19:14,330 --> 01:19:16,750
Oh, yeah. Big horns, short temper?

1042
01:19:16,750 --> 01:19:18,580
Yes.

1043
01:19:19,790 --> 01:19:24,790
Well one night just after you were born,
your mother and I were making curry.

1044
01:19:25,950 --> 01:19:28,000
We're about to eat when the call comes in.

1045
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:31,870
"Gomora is attacking Shirokanedai!"

1046
01:19:32,620 --> 01:19:35,040
I look across the table
at your mother and say,

1047
01:19:35,700 --> 01:19:39,830
"Wouldn't it be a shame if I die tonight
and never get to enjoy this curry?"

1048
01:19:40,450 --> 01:19:42,200
She smiled at me and said,

1049
01:19:42,870 --> 01:19:45,620
"If you die, I'll be heartbroken."

1050
01:19:46,120 --> 01:19:47,790
"I'll grieve for weeks."

1051
01:19:48,580 --> 01:19:52,450
"But I promise this curry
will not go to waste."

1052
01:19:57,250 --> 01:19:58,750
That sounds just like her.

1053
01:20:02,290 --> 01:20:03,500
Before that night,

1054
01:20:04,160 --> 01:20:06,660
I was awkward, impulsive,

1055
01:20:07,250 --> 01:20:09,790
my color timer would go off in minutes.

1056
01:20:10,950 --> 01:20:12,700
But during that battle,

1057
01:20:13,790 --> 01:20:18,120
all I could think about
was your mother's laugh.

1058
01:20:19,040 --> 01:20:20,410
And your face.

1059
01:20:21,950 --> 01:20:26,000
And that was the first time
my color timer didn't go off.

1060
01:20:27,870 --> 01:20:28,700
Uh...

1061
01:20:29,250 --> 01:20:32,250
I... [chuckles] I don't get it.

1062
01:20:33,620 --> 01:20:36,160
Your mother and I
spent our lives juggling,

1063
01:20:36,910 --> 01:20:39,870
trying to bridge the gap
between us and the kaiju,

1064
01:20:39,870 --> 01:20:41,410
trying to raise you.

1065
01:20:42,620 --> 01:20:45,330
Being Ultraman isn't about fighting.

1066
01:20:46,500 --> 01:20:47,580
It's about heart.

1067
01:20:48,540 --> 01:20:52,040
Using your power to bring balance.

1068
01:20:54,790 --> 01:20:57,250
What you're doing now with Emi...

1069
01:20:59,330 --> 01:21:01,620
You've accomplished what we never could.

1070
01:21:08,700 --> 01:21:12,580
Oh, what's wrong, girl?
What are you looking at? Huh?

1071
01:21:13,330 --> 01:21:16,370
Why are the stars moving?

1072
01:21:17,450 --> 01:21:19,500
Mina, scan for incoming.

1073
01:21:20,950 --> 01:21:23,290
<i>My radar systems have been jammed.</i>

1074
01:21:23,290 --> 01:21:24,750
Oh, my God. It's the KDF.

1075
01:21:25,540 --> 01:21:29,040
Emi, come on, baby.
It's the bad men. Come on.

1076
01:21:32,660 --> 01:21:34,450
No. No, Emi! No!

1077
01:21:51,500 --> 01:21:54,200
<i>Drones have located the target.</i>

1078
01:21:54,200 --> 01:21:55,950
<i>Drones have located the target.</i>

1079
01:21:55,950 --> 01:22:00,410
Emi! Behind you! Look out!

1080
01:22:10,790 --> 01:22:12,700
Are there more drones
in the area?

1081
01:22:14,080 --> 01:22:16,450
Do we have more drones in the area?

1082
01:22:16,450 --> 01:22:18,950
Yes, Doctor. A short distance away.

1083
01:22:18,950 --> 01:22:21,250
Send them. Send them now!

1084
01:22:23,250 --> 01:22:27,160
Those drones have
direct video feeds to KDF headquarters.

1085
01:22:27,160 --> 01:22:28,620
We have to go now.

1086
01:22:29,870 --> 01:22:31,870
Come on, sweetie. Time to go.

1087
01:22:35,500 --> 01:22:38,500
Dad, what's wrong with her?
What's happening?

1088
01:22:39,160 --> 01:22:42,580
She's entering a pupal stage, Kenji.

1089
01:22:42,580 --> 01:22:44,250
She's changing.

1090
01:22:44,250 --> 01:22:46,080
Changing? Changing into what?

1091
01:22:46,080 --> 01:22:48,660
I don't know,
but she's vulnerable right now.

1092
01:22:48,660 --> 01:22:50,620
We have to get her someplace safe.

1093
01:22:50,620 --> 01:22:51,870
<i>Firing up the jet.</i>

1094
01:22:57,830 --> 01:23:00,080
- Dad, as soon as the jet arrives...

1095
01:23:00,080 --> 01:23:01,580
Dad!

1096
01:23:01,580 --> 01:23:02,580
Kenji!

1097
01:23:04,370 --> 01:23:05,830
No!

1098
01:23:16,950 --> 01:23:19,120
No!

1099
01:23:46,870 --> 01:23:49,120
Was the homing beacon
successfully deployed?

1100
01:23:49,120 --> 01:23:50,870
Yes, Dr. Onda.

1101
01:23:50,870 --> 01:23:54,040
But some sort of frequency jammer
was engaged.

1102
01:23:54,040 --> 01:23:55,370
We lost the signal,

1103
01:23:55,370 --> 01:23:58,040
but we believe
we can triangulate Ultraman's location

1104
01:23:58,040 --> 01:23:59,330
within a five-mile radius.

1105
01:23:59,330 --> 01:24:03,290
Good. Good. And what of Project Surrogate?

1106
01:24:03,290 --> 01:24:04,500
Good news, sir.

1107
01:24:04,500 --> 01:24:06,790
Estimated time of completion
is five hours.

1108
01:24:07,290 --> 01:24:09,120
The Destroyer is prepped and ready.

1109
01:24:09,120 --> 01:24:11,080
Thank you Captain Aoshima.

1110
01:24:11,870 --> 01:24:13,370
That will be all for now.

1111
01:24:14,080 --> 01:24:14,910
Yes, sir.

1112
01:24:17,660 --> 01:24:21,870
<i>It's the first game of the series
and it appears that Sato is a no-show.</i>

1113
01:24:22,450 --> 01:24:24,620
<i>He was absent during yesterday's practice</i>

1114
01:24:24,620 --> 01:24:27,410
<i>and team management
has been silent on the situation.</i>

1115
01:24:28,250 --> 01:24:29,660
<i>We're all hoping he's okay.</i>

1116
01:24:32,080 --> 01:24:33,790
Mina, any change?

1117
01:24:34,870 --> 01:24:35,750
<i>No, Ken.</i>

1118
01:24:36,370 --> 01:24:40,450
<i>He's stable
but his internal injuries were severe.</i>

1119
01:24:40,450 --> 01:24:42,160
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

1120
01:24:45,580 --> 01:24:46,500
And Emi?

1121
01:24:46,500 --> 01:24:48,330
<i>It's hard to tell, Ken.</i>

1122
01:24:48,330 --> 01:24:51,540
<i>My sensors can't seem
to penetrate the cocoon.</i>

1123
01:25:00,790 --> 01:25:03,790
No. No, no, no.

1124
01:25:03,790 --> 01:25:04,870
It can't be.

1125
01:25:05,830 --> 01:25:07,950
Mina, where did that sound come from?

1126
01:25:07,950 --> 01:25:11,450
<i>It originated from the east, a mile away.</i>

1127
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:22,450
Oh, my God.

1128
01:25:39,700 --> 01:25:41,700
- Huh?

1129
01:25:45,290 --> 01:25:46,290
Emi.

1130
01:25:48,830 --> 01:25:50,750
No. No, Emi. No!

1131
01:25:53,580 --> 01:25:54,790
No, girl.

1132
01:25:55,620 --> 01:25:58,410
Emi, look at me. Look at Daddy.

1133
01:25:58,410 --> 01:26:01,200
Mina, I need an analysis. What do you see?

1134
01:26:01,200 --> 01:26:02,450
<i>Scanning, Ken.</i>

1135
01:26:03,040 --> 01:26:06,000
<i>Something's approaching, entering the bay.</i>

1136
01:26:10,500 --> 01:26:12,160
That's not possible.

1137
01:26:18,870 --> 01:26:21,080
Emi! No!

1138
01:26:24,450 --> 01:26:26,410
Mina, take care of Dad.

1139
01:26:26,410 --> 01:26:28,370
<i>Danger, take evasive action.</i>

1140
01:26:29,830 --> 01:26:31,540
Mina! Shield!

1141
01:26:39,950 --> 01:26:40,790
<i>Kenji.</i>

<i>- Are you...

1144
01:26:55,330 --> 01:26:58,290
<i>Ken, are you okay?</i>

1145
01:26:59,870 --> 01:27:01,750
Oh, God, Mina.

1146
01:27:01,750 --> 01:27:03,790
<i>My systems are compromised.</i>

1147
01:27:04,620 --> 01:27:05,790
<i>I'll be offline soon.</i>

1148
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:09,830
Dad?

1149
01:27:34,580 --> 01:27:36,620
Mina, is he gone?

1150
01:27:37,450 --> 01:27:39,370
<i>I'm sorry,</i>

1151
01:27:39,370 --> 01:27:43,660
<i>but my scans don't detect life.</i>

1152
01:27:48,250 --> 01:27:49,080
<i>Ken?</i>

1153
01:27:52,500 --> 01:27:57,080
<i>I've observed you since you were young,</i>

1154

<i>Both of your parents.</i>

01:28:12,450 --> 01:28:15,290

01:30:28,160 --> 01:30:32,200
We are headed southeast.
The infant is keeping a steady pace.

1175
01:30:32,200 --> 01:30:33,290
Good.

1176
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:36,500
We'll follow them back to Kaiju Island.

1177
01:30:36,500 --> 01:30:40,750
And once we're there,
we will do what needs to be done.

1178
01:30:42,580 --> 01:30:46,330
Dr. Onda, how did you know
that we could lure the infant out?

1179
01:30:47,200 --> 01:30:50,660
As I said, Captain, family is everything,

There's my girl.

1182
01:31:10,750 --> 01:31:14,040
Emi. We gotta go, girl.
That's not your real mama.

1183
01:31:14,040 --> 01:31:15,370
She's just a fake.

1184

Mecha Gigantron, attack!

1187
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:13,290
Missile attack now!

1188
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:27,250
No!

1189
01:32:31,870 --> 01:32:32,870
No! No, no.

Come on. Come on. Come on.

1192
01:32:39,870 --> 01:32:41,660
Wake up. Wake up, girl!

1193
01:33:11,910 --> 01:33:13,000
Huh?

1194
01:33:14,580 --> 01:33:16,080
Oh, my God.

1195
01:33:32,950 --> 01:33:34,410

<i>Your dad wants to be here

Dad? You're alive.

1201
01:34:45,370 --> 01:34:48,950
I promised I would always be here.

1202
01:34:51,370 --> 01:34:52,620
Another Ultra?

1203
01:34:53,540 --> 01:34:54,750
Kill them both!

1204
01:34:59,290 --> 01:35:00,620
What's wrong with her, girl?

1205
01:35:06,580 --> 01:35:07,950
- What's happening?

1206
01:35:07,950 --> 01:35:11,160
Sir, The Mech systems
are no longer accepting our commands.

1207
01:35:11,160 --> 01:35:13,410
Try again.

1208
01:35:35,870 --> 01:35:39,450
Sir, Gigantron
has overridden our protocols.

1209
01:35:39,450 --> 01:35:42,580
It seems the creature
is no longer under our control.

1210
01:35:45,200 --> 01:35:47,330
Escort the crew to the escape pods.

1211
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:49,660
See to it that everyone is safe.

1212
01:35:50,290 --> 01:35:53,040
- But sir, I--
- The KDF must survive.

1213
01:35:53,870 --> 01:35:55,500
Even if I don't.

1214
01:35:58,660 --> 01:35:59,500
Go now.

1215
01:36:05,080 --> 01:36:06,370
Abandon ship!

1216
01:36:06,370 --> 01:36:08,160

- Abandon ship!

1218
01:36:10,790 --> 01:36:12,830
Let's go! Move it!

1219
01:36:21,370 --> 01:36:24,620
Is this the part where the villain
sends a hidden force we didn't know about?

1220
01:36:24,620 --> 01:36:26,870
Those are escape pods.

1221
01:37:10,500 --> 01:37:12,080

1222
01:37:12,080 --> 01:37:13,660
I'm fine, Kenji.

Well I'm not gonna do it alone.

1271
01:44:34,500 --> 01:44:38,080
to their first championship title
in years.

1272
01:44:38,080 --> 01:44:39,620
That's gotta feel good.

1273
01:44:40,370 --> 01:44:42,200
I can't take the credit.

1274
01:44:42,870 --> 01:44:45,500
It was this team, these guys.

1275
01:44:45,500 --> 01:44:48,040
<i>- I'm just happy to be a part of it.</i>

1276
01:44:57,370 --> 01:45:00,080
Earlier, I spoke with Shimura, who said,

1277
01:45:00,750 --> 01:45:05,040
"Ken Sato might be the finest player
I've ever coached."

1278
01:45:05,040 --> 01:45:08,080
"He exemplifies what it means
to be a Giant."

1279
01:45:10,080 --> 01:45:15,000
Many critics, including myself,
have noticed a change.

1280
01:45:16,120 --> 01:45:17,870
What do you attribute that to?

1281
01:45:19,580 --> 01:45:22,250
I wouldn't be here without my family,
simple as that.

1282
01:45:22,950 --> 01:45:24,660
My dad, mom.

1283
01:45:25,950 --> 01:45:27,330
They made this possible.

1284
01:45:28,330 --> 01:45:31,080
I just wish she could be here to see it.

1285
01:45:32,540 --> 01:45:35,250
I'm sure she'd be proud.

1286
01:45:37,580 --> 01:45:39,660
She used to leave these messages.

1287
01:45:40,410 --> 01:45:42,910
Little things to help me
get through tough times.

1288
01:45:43,500 --> 01:45:44,830
Mind if I share?

1289
01:45:47,660 --> 01:45:50,540
<i>Kenji,
you're probably not even up yet.</i>

1290
01:45:50,540 --> 01:45:56,290
<i>But I was thinking about you
and I wanted to share a list of hopes.</i>

1291
01:45:57,290 --> 01:46:00,250
<i>I hope that you'll
give your father a chance.</i>

1292
01:46:00,250 --> 01:46:03,540
<i>Whether you believe it or not,
he loves you with all his heart.</i>

1293
01:46:04,790 --> 01:46:07,120
<i>I hope you'll understand us better.</i>

1294
01:46:07,830 --> 01:46:11,330
<i>Understand that we were
just trying to prepare you</i>

1295
01:46:11,330 --> 01:46:13,950
<i>for all the challenges headed your way.</i>

1296
01:46:13,950 --> 01:46:18,910
<i>And as time passes, we fade into memory,</i>

1297
01:46:18,910 --> 01:46:22,790
<i>I hope that you'll pass
some of those memories,</i>

1298
01:46:22,790 --> 01:46:24,950
<i>some of those lessons along</i>

1299
01:46:24,950 --> 01:46:28,080
<i>because in the end,
it was all done with love, kiddo.</i>

1300
01:46:30,790 --> 01:46:32,000
<i>I miss you.</i>

1301
01:46:34,580 --> 01:46:35,500
<i>See you soon.</i>

1302
01:49:52,950 --> 01:49:55,870
<i>Kenji? Can you hear me?</i>

1303
01:49:55,870 --> 01:49:56,950
<i>It's Mom.</i>

1304
01:49:56,950 --> 01:49:58,040
<i>I'm still alive.</i>

1305
01:49:58,620 --> 01:50:00,080
<i>Help me get back home.</i>
