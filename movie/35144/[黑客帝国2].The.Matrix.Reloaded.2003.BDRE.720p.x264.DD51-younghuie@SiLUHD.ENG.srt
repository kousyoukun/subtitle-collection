1
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:29,280
See you tomorrow.

2
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:49,630
Oh, my God!

3
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:13,960
I'm in.

4
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:08,720
We're almost there.

5
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:12,820
Sir, are you sure about this? I told you, we're going to be all right.

6
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:18,450
I understand, sir. It's just that I'm scoping some serious sentinel activity up here.

7
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,990
Link. Yes, sir?

8
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:02,260
Given your situation, I can't say I understand your reasons...

9
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:05,120
...for volunteering to operate onboard my ship.

10
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:09,280
However, if you wish to continue to do so, I must ask you to do one thing.

11
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:11,280
What's that, sir?

12
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:13,320
To trust me.

13
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,450
Yes, sir. I will, sir.

14
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:20,640
I mean, I do, sir. I hope so.

15
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:24,180
Repatch the main AC to the hard drives and stand by to broadcast.

16
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:25,440
Yes, sir.

17
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:36,500
Still can't sleep?

18
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:39,830
You wanna talk?

19
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:44,730
They're just dreams.

20
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:49,460
If you're afraid of something...

21
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:54,380
I just wish... I wish I knew what I'm supposed to do.

22
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,360
That's all.

23
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:58,850
I just wish I knew.

24
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:03,280
She's gonna call. Don't worry.

25
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:04,480
Here you are.

26
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:08,120
Are we ready to go? We're already late.

27
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:12,910
These geotherms confirm the last transmission of the Osiris.

28
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:15,310
The machines are digging.

29
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:19,270
They're boring from the surface down to Zion.

30
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:22,010
Mother... They'll avoid the perimeter defense.

31
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:23,670
How fast are they moving?

32
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:27,240
Control estimates their descent at 100 meters an hour. Shit!

33
00:06:27,410 --> 00:06:29,840
How deep are they? Almost 2000 meters.

34
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:33,570
What about the scans from the Osiris? They can't be accurate.

35
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:35,630
They may be. It's not possible.

36
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,260
That'd mean there are a quarter-million sentinels.

37
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:39,930
That's right. That can't be.

38
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:41,760
Why not?

39
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:45,660
A sentinel for every man, woman and child in Zion.

40
00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:50,590
That sounds exactly like the thinking of a machine to me.

41
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,920
Morpheus, glad you could join us.

42
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:54,590
Niobe.

43
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:59,320
My apologies to all. But as you are undoubtedly aware...

44
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,780
...it's become difficult to locate a secure broadcast position.

45
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:06,210
Squiddies got our best spots. Lines are crawling with them.

46
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:10,150
And if Niobe's right, in 72 hours there's gonna be a quarter-million more.

47
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:11,440
What are we gonna do?

48
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:13,910
We're gonna do what Commander Lock ordered.

49
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,810
We'll evacuate broadcast level and return to Zion.

50
00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:22,100
And does the commander have a plan for stopping 250,000 sentinels?

51
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:24,970
A strategy is still being formulated.

52
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:26,770
I'm sure it is.

53
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:43,760
What do you think we should do, Morpheus?

54
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:46,090
We should proceed as ordered... What is it?

55
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:47,320
I don't know.

56
00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:50,250
...however, I must ask one of you for help.

57
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:56,150
Some of you believe as I believe, some of you do not. Those of you that do...

58
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:58,850
...know we are nearing the end of our struggle.

59
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:03,250
The prophecy will be fulfilled soon. But before it can be...

60
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:06,780
...the Oracle must be consulted.

61
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:16,910
If we return and recharge now...

62
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:20,840
...we can be back in 36 hours, well before the machines reach this depth.

63
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:22,870
Do you understand what you're asking?

64
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:25,900
I am asking that one ship remain here in our place...

65
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:28,760
...just in case the Oracle should attempt to contact us.

66
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:32,030
Bullshit. You're asking one of us to disobey a direct order.

67
00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:36,760
That's right, I am. But we well know that the reason most of us are here...

68
00:08:36,930 --> 00:08:39,520
...is because of our affinity for disobedience.

69
00:08:39,730 --> 00:08:41,490
What happens when you get back to Zion...

70
00:08:41,790 --> 00:08:44,190
...and the commander throws you in the stockade?

71
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,800
He won't.

72
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:49,920
Goddamn it, Morpheus, you ain't never gonna change.

73
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:53,380
Shit, I'll do it just to see what Deadbolt does to you.

74
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:55,080
You got 36 hours.

75
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,880
I'm looking for Neo.

76
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:03,440
Never heard of him. I have something for him.

77
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,840
A gift.

78
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,940
You see, he set me free.

79
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,600
Fine, whatever. Now piss off.

80
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:18,170
Who was that? How did you know someone was here?

81
00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:19,800
He gave you this.

82
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:26,960
He said you set him free.

83
00:09:28,930 --> 00:09:31,260
Is everything all right, sir?

84
00:09:31,890 --> 00:09:34,260
The meeting is over. Retreat to your exits.

85
00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:36,620
Agents are coming. Agents?

86
00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:38,460
Go.

87
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:49,520
Hiya, fellas.

88
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:50,820
It's him. The anomaly.

89
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:52,250
Do we proceed? Yes.

90
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:54,910
He is still... Only human.

91
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:03,310
Upgrades.

92
00:10:58,180 --> 00:11:00,710
That went as expected. Yes.

93
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:03,540
It's happening exactly as before.

94
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:06,370
Well, not exactly.

95
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:12,200
What happened? I can't figure it out.

96
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:14,030
Agents just came out of nowhere.

97
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:17,200
Then the code got all weird. Encryption I've never seen.

98
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:20,290
Is Neo okay? Okay? Shit, you should've seen him.

99
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:25,050
Where is he now? He's doing his Superman thing.

100
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:16,630
Where are you?

101
00:12:21,290 --> 00:12:24,860
This is the Nebuchadnezzar, requesting access through Gate Three.

102
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:33,390
Nebuchadnezzar, this is Zion Control. Maintain present velocity and stand by.

103
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:35,020
Roger that, Control.

104
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:38,680
This is Control requesting immediate stand-down of arms at Gate Three.

105
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:42,680
We have the Nebuchadnezzar on approach. Let's open her up.

106
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:51,210
You are cleared through Gate Three to Bay Seven.

107
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:53,070
Roger that, Control.

108
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:03,570
Door's open, bed's made. Welcome home.

109
00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:06,470
No place like it.

110
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:24,350
Roger that, Control. Zion Control, stand by for Gate Three lockdown.

111
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:16,190
The Nebuchadnezzar is down. Bay Seven.

112
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:17,520
Understood.

113
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:28,780
Captain Mifune.

114
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,010
Captain Morpheus.

115
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:34,050
Are you here to escort me to the stockade, captain?

116
00:14:34,210 --> 00:14:37,610
I'm just here to keep the peace. Commander Lock demands...

117
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:42,040
Requests your immediate counsel, sir.

118
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:44,770
Link. Sir?

119
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:47,500
I want the ship ready to go as soon as possible.

120
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:49,240
Understood, sir.

121
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,800
What is it between them? Morpheus and Lock?

122
00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:02,100
Niobe. Captain Niobe?

123
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:05,460
She used to be with Morpheus. Now she's with Lock.

124
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:08,290
What happened?

125
00:15:08,530 --> 00:15:11,920
Morpheus went to the Oracle. After that, everything changed.

126
00:15:12,090 --> 00:15:14,750
Yeah, she can do that.

127
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:16,090
Neo!

128
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:19,950
Oh, no. How does he always know?

129
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:22,080
Doesn't he have anything better to do?

130
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:24,950
You know what they say about the life you save.

131
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:26,910
I didn't save his life.

132
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,480
Hiya, Neo.

133
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:34,240
Trinity, Link. Hey.

134
00:15:34,410 --> 00:15:38,070
It's great to have you back. Thanks. It's good to be back.

135
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:41,000
Can I carry that for you? No, I can carry my own bag.

136
00:15:41,170 --> 00:15:42,840
Trinity? I'm fine.

137
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:46,670
You can carry these. Yeah, sure, Link.

138
00:15:51,570 --> 00:15:56,060
Hey, you know, next year I'm old enough to join a crew, right?

139
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:58,990
I've been thinking about it, and I've made my decision.

140
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:00,630
Let me guess.

141
00:16:01,130 --> 00:16:03,060
I want to join the Nebuchadnezzar.

142
00:16:04,090 --> 00:16:07,590
Morpheus hasn't filled the other positions, except for you, Link.

143
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:09,160
I'm sure he has reasons...

144
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:12,650
...but the more I think about it, the more I think it's meant to be.

145
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:14,350
You know, it's fate.

146
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:16,080
You're the reason I'm here, Neo.

147
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:18,780
I told you, you found me. I didn't find you.

148
00:16:18,950 --> 00:16:21,480
I know, but you got me out. You saved me.

149
00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:24,250
You saved yourself.

150
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:43,800
Morpheus. Commander Lock.

151
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:48,530
I spoke to the other captains. I wanted to offer you a chance to explain your actions.

152
00:16:48,730 --> 00:16:51,600
I wasn't aware that my actions required any explanation.

153
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:54,060
You were given an order to return to Zion.

154
00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:57,060
I did. You asked for one ship to remain behind.

155
00:16:57,230 --> 00:16:59,890
I would have stayed, but I needed to recharge my ship.

156
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:02,760
So you admit to a direct contravention of your duty.

157
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:06,320
We need a presence inside the Matrix to await contact from the Oracle.

158
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:08,450
I don't want to hear that shit!

159
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:11,280
I don't care about oracles or prophecies or messiahs!

160
00:17:11,450 --> 00:17:14,880
I care about one thing: Stopping that army from destroying this city.

161
00:17:15,050 --> 00:17:17,880
To do that I need soldiers to obey my orders.

162
00:17:18,050 --> 00:17:22,610
With all due respect, commander, there is only one way to save our city.

163
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:24,210
How?

164
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:27,140
Neo. Goddamn it, Morpheus.

165
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:29,940
Not everyone believes what you believe.

166
00:17:30,110 --> 00:17:32,210
My beliefs do not require them to.

167
00:17:40,570 --> 00:17:44,460
There's a gathering tonight. Everyone's talking. A lot of people are scared.

168
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:47,400
No one remembers the last time so many ships were docked.

169
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:50,530
Something big is happening, isn't it? Hey.

170
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:53,860
We're not allowed to say anything, so stop asking.

171
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:02,250
Goddamn, it's good to be home.

172
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:18,210
I'm recommending that you be removed from duty.

173
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:20,710
That is, of course, your prerogative, commander.

174
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:24,740
If it were up to me, you wouldn't set foot on a ship for the rest of your life.

175
00:18:24,910 --> 00:18:28,200
Then I am grateful that it is not up to you.

176
00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:36,530
Councillor Hamann. Commander.

177
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,900
Captain. Councillor.

178
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:43,430
Council's asked me to speak tonight at the temple gathering.

179
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:47,690
The presence of the fleet and the persistence of rumors must be addressed.

180
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:50,360
The people must be told what is happening.

181
00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:52,220
Of course, councillor.

182
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:58,190
But might I advise a level of discretion concerning specific details.

183
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:01,350
We do not wish to start a panic. Quite right.

184
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:04,620
A panic is not what anyone wants.

185
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:08,610
What about you, captain? What would you advise?

186
00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:15,280
The truth. No one will panic, because there is nothing to fear.

187
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,540
That army won't reach the gates of Zion.

188
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:21,940
What makes you so sure? Consider what we have seen, councillor.

189
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:23,970
Consider that in the past six months...

190
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:26,170
...we have freed more minds than in six years.

191
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:29,330
This attack is an act of desperation.

192
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:33,330
I believe very soon the prophecy will be fulfilled and this war will end.

193
00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:37,330
I hope you're right, captain.

194
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:40,230
I do not believe it to be a matter of hope, councillor.

195
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,960
It is simply a matter of time.

196
00:19:45,130 --> 00:19:46,590
My stop.

197
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:48,160
See you soon.

198
00:19:48,330 --> 00:19:49,790
Hopefully not too soon.

199
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:53,120
Let's go, kid. These two got things to do.

200
00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:04,280
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

201
00:20:04,450 --> 00:20:06,850
I am if you're thinking this elevator is too slow.

202
00:20:07,050 --> 00:20:10,380
How long do we charge the Neb? Twenty-four, maybe 30 hours.

203
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:14,740
Some people go their entire lives without hearing news that good.

204
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:43,460
Neo, please, I have a son, Jacob, aboard the Gnosis.

205
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:47,150
Please, watch over him. I'll try.

206
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:49,390
I have a daughter on the Icarus.

207
00:20:50,390 --> 00:20:51,650
No, wait.

208
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:54,320
It's all right. They need you.

209
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:56,750
I need you. I know.

210
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:59,580
There's time.

211
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:06,880
Where's my puss...?

212
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:09,370
Hey! Uncle Link!

213
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:11,170
God!

214
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:13,270
Uncle Link!

215
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:17,040
Oh, my God! You're so huge!

216
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,370
You should be picking me up! No!

217
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:21,070
Yeah! Okay!

218
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:22,930
Okay? All right.

219
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:26,130
Now, we're gonna have to work together here, okay?

220
00:21:26,330 --> 00:21:28,530
One, two, three, lift!

221
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:31,860
Oh, my God! What are you feeding these two?

222
00:21:32,030 --> 00:21:34,730
Come on, kids. It's time to go.

223
00:21:36,530 --> 00:21:37,860
Hey, Cas. Hey.

224
00:21:38,390 --> 00:21:40,920
Good to have you home, Link. Good to be home.

225
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,920
You be careful with her.

226
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:45,890
Don't worry about me. He's the one that's gonna get it.

227
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:50,080
Out the door! Both of you, march!

228
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:52,320
Bye! Bye!

229
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:00,210
I'm gonna get what?

230
00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:05,570
Every ship up there's been home two, even three times more than the Nebuchadnezzar.

231
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:09,570
Come on, Zee. I thought we were past this.

232
00:22:09,770 --> 00:22:13,170
We'll be when you operate another ship. I can't do that.

233
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:14,840
Why? You know why.

234
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,170
If Dozer knew how I felt, he wouldn't have asked you to do this.

235
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:21,400
Maybe. But it's too late now.

236
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:24,200
I made a promise, and some promises can't be unmade.

237
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:27,090
It's not fair. Nobody said it was gonna be.

238
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:30,190
You think Cas thinks it's fair that I'm here and Dozer's not?

239
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:39,320
I lost two brothers to that ship, Link.

240
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:42,620
I'm afraid of it.

241
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:46,820
I'm afraid it's gonna take you too.

242
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:49,310
It won't.

243
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:51,310
How can you say that to me?

244
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:53,450
Because of Morpheus.

245
00:22:53,610 --> 00:22:58,240
Because of what he's told me. He said that this is it, that it will be over soon.

246
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:02,610
Link, Morpheus is crazy. No doubt.

247
00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:06,300
But Tank and Dozer believed him. And I'll tell you what...

248
00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:11,800
...after being on that ship and seeing Neo do the things he can do, I gotta say...

249
00:23:11,970 --> 00:23:14,000
...I'm starting to believe him too.

250
00:23:19,130 --> 00:23:21,560
Be careful, Link.

251
00:23:26,890 --> 00:23:29,260
Please be careful.

252
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:41,750
They started yet? Only Councillor Hamann's opening prayer.

253
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:45,010
Tonight, let us honor these men and women.

254
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:47,780
These are our soldiers, our warriors.

255
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:52,210
These are our husbands and wives, our brothers and sisters...

256
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:54,040
...our children.

257
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:57,740
Let us remember those that have been lost...

258
00:23:57,910 --> 00:24:01,110
...and let us give thanks for those that have been found...

259
00:24:01,310 --> 00:24:04,570
...and who stand here beside us.

260
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:08,430
Now I would like someone else to close this prayer...

261
00:24:08,630 --> 00:24:11,830
...someone who hasn't spoken here in a long time...

262
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:17,360
...but who I believe has something to say that we all need to hear.

263
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:19,930
I give you Morpheus.

264
00:24:39,450 --> 00:24:43,610
Zion! Hear me!

265
00:24:44,610 --> 00:24:47,710
It is true what many of you have heard.

266
00:24:47,910 --> 00:24:51,870
The machines have gathered an army, and as I speak...

267
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:55,970
...that army is drawing nearer to our home.

268
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:02,700
Believe me when I say we have a difficult time ahead of us.

269
00:25:02,770 --> 00:25:08,930
But if we are to be prepared for it, we must first shed our fear of it.

270
00:25:09,430 --> 00:25:14,330
I stand here before you now truthfully unafraid.

271
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:16,660
Why?

272
00:25:17,090 --> 00:25:19,920
Because I believe something you do not?

273
00:25:20,090 --> 00:25:21,920
No!

274
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:27,150
I stand here without fear because I remember.

275
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:31,250
I remember that I am here not because of the path that lies before me...

276
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:34,750
...but because of the path that lies behind me.

277
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:39,580
I remember that for 100 years we have fought these machines.

278
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:44,780
I remember that for 100 years they have sent their armies to destroy us.

279
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:50,740
And after a century of war, I remember that which matters most:

280
00:25:51,610 --> 00:25:54,600
We are still here!

281
00:26:01,330 --> 00:26:03,400
Tonight...

282
00:26:03,570 --> 00:26:06,930
...let us send a message to that army.

283
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:10,130
Tonight, let us shake this cave.

284
00:26:10,330 --> 00:26:14,190
Tonight, let us tremble these halls...

285
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:17,460
...of earth, steel and stone.

286
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:22,890
Let us be heard from red core to black sky.

287
00:26:23,050 --> 00:26:27,580
Tonight, let us make them remember:

288
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:32,710
This is Zion and we are not afraid!

289
00:26:56,230 --> 00:26:58,230
I remember.

290
00:26:59,070 --> 00:27:01,460
I remember you used to dance.

291
00:27:03,130 --> 00:27:06,390
I remember you were pretty good.

292
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:10,990
There are some things in this world, Captain Niobe...

293
00:27:11,190 --> 00:27:14,290
...that will never change.

294
00:27:15,290 --> 00:27:17,190
Niobe!

295
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:23,650
Some things do change.

296
00:27:43,110 --> 00:27:44,900
Excuse me.

297
00:27:56,760 --> 00:28:00,230
I missed you. I can tell.

298
00:28:00,690 --> 00:28:04,390
I was thinking, everyone is here.

299
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:07,260
Follow me.

300
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:31,840
Neo, what is it?

301
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:34,370
What's wrong?

302
00:31:35,970 --> 00:31:38,270
It's okay, you can tell me.

303
00:31:38,670 --> 00:31:41,140
Trinity...

304
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:44,100
Don't be afraid.

305
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:46,600
I can't lose you.

306
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:48,670
You're not gonna lose me.

307
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:55,670
You feel this?

308
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:57,630
I'm never letting go.

309
00:32:34,790 --> 00:32:37,460
Good night, Zion.

310
00:32:37,630 --> 00:32:40,290
Sweet dreams.

311
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:52,120
You all right? I'll make it.

312
00:32:52,290 --> 00:32:54,890
Did you see that agent? I've never seen anything like that.

313
00:32:55,090 --> 00:32:57,160
It doesn't matter. All that matters is this.

314
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:59,620
You first.

315
00:33:10,490 --> 00:33:13,360
Oh, God. "Smith" will suffice.

316
00:33:25,290 --> 00:33:29,150
Thank you. My pleasure.

317
00:34:18,510 --> 00:34:21,780
Care for some company? Councillor Hamann.

318
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:25,480
I don't want to intrude if you'd prefer to be alone.

319
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:29,480
No, I could probably use some company. Good.

320
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:32,310
So could I.

321
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:37,940
It's nice tonight.

322
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:40,840
Very calm.

323
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:43,770
It feels like everyone is sleeping very peacefully.

324
00:34:44,170 --> 00:34:46,610
Not everyone.

325
00:34:47,110 --> 00:34:51,810
I hate sleeping. I never sleep more than a few hours.

326
00:34:51,970 --> 00:34:56,040
I figure I slept the first 11 years of my life, now I'm making up for it.

327
00:34:56,470 --> 00:35:01,200
What about you? I just haven't been able to sleep much.

328
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:05,800
It's a good sign. Of what?

329
00:35:05,970 --> 00:35:09,140
That you are in fact still human.

330
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:16,640
Have you ever been to the engineering level?

331
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:19,830
I love to walk there at night. It's quite amazing.

332
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:22,570
Would you like to see it? Sure.

333
00:35:33,230 --> 00:35:37,700
Almost no one comes down here. Unless, of course, there's a problem.

334
00:35:37,870 --> 00:35:42,930
That's how it is with people. Nobody cares how it works as long as it works.

335
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:45,400
I like it down here.

336
00:35:45,570 --> 00:35:51,360
I like to be reminded this city survives because of these machines.

337
00:35:51,530 --> 00:35:56,630
These machines are keeping us alive while other machines are coming to kill us.

338
00:35:57,060 --> 00:36:01,890
Interesting, isn't it? The power to give life...

339
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:05,260
...and the power to end it. We have the same power.

340
00:36:05,430 --> 00:36:08,160
Yeah, I suppose we do, but...

341
00:36:08,330 --> 00:36:11,760
...sometimes I think about those people still plugged into the Matrix.

342
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:14,930
And when I look at these machines...

343
00:36:15,130 --> 00:36:20,190
...I can't help thinking that, in a way, we are plugged into them.

344
00:36:20,490 --> 00:36:23,560
But we control these machines, they don't control us.

345
00:36:23,790 --> 00:36:26,760
Of course not. How could they?

346
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:29,490
The idea is pure nonsense...

347
00:36:29,990 --> 00:36:33,090
...but it does make one wonder just...

348
00:36:33,290 --> 00:36:34,860
...what is control?

349
00:36:35,130 --> 00:36:38,160
If we wanted, we could shut these machines down.

350
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:42,990
Of course. That's it. You hit it. That's control, isn't it?

351
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:46,990
If we wanted, we could smash them to bits.

352
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:51,360
Although if we did, we'd have to consider what would happen to our lights...

353
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:54,690
...our heat, our air.

354
00:36:55,190 --> 00:36:59,320
So we need machines and they need us. Is that your point, councillor?

355
00:36:59,490 --> 00:37:02,120
No. No point.

356
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:07,390
Old men like me don't bother with making points. There's no point.

357
00:37:07,690 --> 00:37:11,480
Is that why there are no young men on the Council?

358
00:37:11,650 --> 00:37:13,320
Good point.

359
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:18,180
Why don't you tell me what's on your mind, councillor.

360
00:37:18,350 --> 00:37:21,620
There is so much in this world...

361
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:24,680
...that I do not understand.

362
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:31,310
See that machine? It has something to do with recycling our water supply.

363
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:34,510
I have absolutely no idea how it works.

364
00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:38,650
But I do understand the reason for it to work.

365
00:37:40,150 --> 00:37:44,750
I have absolutely no idea how you are able to do some of the things you do.

366
00:37:45,810 --> 00:37:49,080
But I believe there's a reason for that as well.

367
00:37:49,850 --> 00:37:55,280
I only hope we understand that reason before it's too late.

368
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:03,140
Ballard. Is he here?

369
00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:08,140
Neo, it's from the Oracle.

370
00:38:11,110 --> 00:38:12,810
It's time to go.

371
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:16,240
Morpheus said this was how it was gonna happen.

372
00:38:16,410 --> 00:38:21,310
I don't know. Maybe the prophecy's true, maybe it's not.

373
00:38:21,370 --> 00:38:24,510
All I know is, that ship needs an operator.

374
00:38:26,110 --> 00:38:27,970
Right now, that operator's me.

375
00:38:28,610 --> 00:38:30,670
I know.

376
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:37,410
Zee... I want you to wear it.

377
00:38:37,470 --> 00:38:40,870
You know I don't believe in this stuff. But I do.

378
00:38:40,870 --> 00:38:43,900
It's always brought me luck.

379
00:38:43,970 --> 00:38:48,200
Maybe it'll bring me you. I'm coming back.

380
00:38:48,270 --> 00:38:52,900
I promise. No matter what it takes, I'm coming home.

381
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:57,140
Just keep it with you. Please.

382
00:38:57,300 --> 00:38:59,400
For me.

383
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:04,100
Okay.

384
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:25,730
Neo! How the hell...?

385
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:28,300
Bane.

386
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:29,800
Is something wrong?

387
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,700
No, I'm fine.

388
00:39:31,860 --> 00:39:34,630
I just wanted to catch you to say...

389
00:39:34,830 --> 00:39:36,630
...good luck.

390
00:39:38,330 --> 00:39:40,030
Thanks.

391
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:42,590
We'll see you.

392
00:39:44,190 --> 00:39:47,260
Neo! Just in time.

393
00:39:47,430 --> 00:39:49,760
You're gonna see the Oracle? There's no time.

394
00:39:49,930 --> 00:39:51,560
I had to give something to Neo.

395
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:54,990
A gift from one of the orphans.

396
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:58,560
He made me swear to get it to you before you left.

397
00:39:59,430 --> 00:40:01,890
He said you'd understand.

398
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:06,690
Thanks.

399
00:40:13,790 --> 00:40:16,690
I was just told you cleared the Nebuchadnezzar for takeoff.

400
00:40:16,860 --> 00:40:18,820
That is correct.

401
00:40:18,990 --> 00:40:21,520
Am I still in charge of our defense system?

402
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:22,390
Of course.

403
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:25,150
I believe I need every ship...

404
00:40:25,150 --> 00:40:27,650
...we have if we're going to survive this attack.

405
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:29,890
I understand that, commander.

406
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:32,620
Then why did you allow the Nebuchadnezzar to leave?

407
00:40:32,820 --> 00:40:37,690
Because I believe our survival depends on more than how many ships we have.

408
00:40:40,190 --> 00:40:42,490
Be careful.

409
00:41:11,780 --> 00:41:13,980
Hello.

410
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:27,810
You seek the Oracle. Who are you?

411
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:35,340
I am Seraph. I can take you to her, but first I must apologize.

412
00:41:35,610 --> 00:41:37,310
Apologize for what?

413
00:41:37,980 --> 00:41:39,780
For this.

414
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:39,270
Good.

415
00:42:41,770 --> 00:42:44,930
The Oracle has many enemies. I had to be sure.

416
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:47,330
Of what? That you are the One.

417
00:42:47,770 --> 00:42:51,530
You could have just asked. No. You do not truly know someone...

418
00:42:51,700 --> 00:42:53,930
...until you fight them.

419
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:57,930
Come. She's waiting.

420
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,860
Where the hell did they go?

421
00:43:15,230 --> 00:43:17,930
These are back doors, aren't they?

422
00:43:18,130 --> 00:43:21,030
Programmer access.

423
00:43:22,130 --> 00:43:25,860
How do they work? A code is hidden in tumblers.

424
00:43:26,030 --> 00:43:31,030
One position opens a lock and another position opens one of these doors.

425
00:43:32,790 --> 00:43:35,630
Are you a programmer?

426
00:43:35,790 --> 00:43:38,090
Then what are you?

427
00:43:40,290 --> 00:43:43,790
I protect that which matters most.

428
00:44:03,790 --> 00:44:07,160
Well, come on. I ain't gonna bite you.

429
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:10,360
Come around here and let me have a look at you.

430
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:15,970
My goodness, look at you.

431
00:44:16,300 --> 00:44:19,140
You turned out all right, didn't you?

432
00:44:19,310 --> 00:44:21,510
How do you feel? I...

433
00:44:21,670 --> 00:44:25,240
I know you're not sleeping. We'll get to that.

434
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:28,150
Why don't you come and have a sit this time.

435
00:44:28,850 --> 00:44:32,980
Maybe I'll stand. Well, suit yourself.

436
00:44:44,130 --> 00:44:46,660
I felt like sitting. I know.

437
00:44:47,830 --> 00:44:49,730
So...

438
00:44:51,830 --> 00:44:54,240
...let's get the obvious stuff out of the way.

439
00:44:54,540 --> 00:44:59,010
You're not human, are you? It's tough to get more obvious than that.

440
00:44:59,170 --> 00:45:05,010
If I had to guess, I'd say you're a program from the machine world.

441
00:45:05,380 --> 00:45:09,620
So is he. So far, so good.

442
00:45:09,790 --> 00:45:12,920
But if that's true, that could mean you're part of this system...

443
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:15,690
...another kind of control.

444
00:45:15,860 --> 00:45:20,360
Keep going. I suppose the most obvious question is...

445
00:45:20,530 --> 00:45:24,430
...how can I trust you? Bingo.

446
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:28,730
It is a pickle, no doubt about it. Bad news is...

447
00:45:28,900 --> 00:45:32,570
...there's no way you can really know if I'm here to help you or not.

448
00:45:32,740 --> 00:45:36,270
So it's really up to you. Just have to make up your own damn mind...

449
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:41,250
...to either accept what I'm going to tell you or reject it.

450
00:45:42,550 --> 00:45:44,720
Candy?

451
00:45:47,420 --> 00:45:51,860
Do you already know if I'll take it? Wouldn't be much of an oracle if I didn't.

452
00:45:52,020 --> 00:45:55,220
But if you already know, how can I make a choice?

453
00:45:55,390 --> 00:45:59,430
Because you didn't come here to make the choice. You've already made it.

454
00:45:59,630 --> 00:46:04,230
You're here to try to understand why you made it.

455
00:46:09,810 --> 00:46:12,740
I thought you'd have figured that out by now.

456
00:46:14,510 --> 00:46:17,080
Why are you here? Same reason.

457
00:46:17,350 --> 00:46:20,080
I love candy.

458
00:46:20,250 --> 00:46:23,080
But why help us?

459
00:46:23,250 --> 00:46:26,750
We're all here to do what we're all here to do.

460
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:30,390
I'm interested in one thing, Neo: the future.

461
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:34,760
And believe me, I know, the only way to get there is together.

462
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:40,530
Are there other programs like you? Well, not like me, but...

463
00:46:40,700 --> 00:46:43,370
Look. See those birds?

464
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:46,970
At some point, a program was written to govern them.

465
00:46:47,170 --> 00:46:53,010
A program was written to watch over the trees and the wind, the sunrise and sunset.

466
00:46:53,250 --> 00:46:56,110
There are programs running all over the place.

467
00:46:56,310 --> 00:47:00,750
The ones doing their job, doing what they were meant to do, are invisible.

468
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:04,760
You'd never even know they were here. But the other ones...

469
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:09,030
Well, you hear about them all the time.

470
00:47:09,590 --> 00:47:12,460
I've never heard of them. Of course you have.

471
00:47:12,660 --> 00:47:17,570
Every time you've heard someone say they saw a ghost or an angel...

472
00:47:17,730 --> 00:47:22,300
...every story you've ever heard about vampires, werewolves or aliens...

473
00:47:22,510 --> 00:47:24,810
...is the system assimilating some program...

474
00:47:25,010 --> 00:47:29,640
...that's doing something they're not supposed to be doing.

475
00:47:29,850 --> 00:47:32,850
Programs hacking programs.

476
00:47:33,020 --> 00:47:35,880
Why? They have their reasons but...

477
00:47:36,050 --> 00:47:39,990
...usually a program chooses exile when it faces deletion.

478
00:47:40,420 --> 00:47:44,360
And why would a program be deleted? Maybe it breaks down.

479
00:47:44,530 --> 00:47:49,060
Maybe a better program is created to replace it. Happens all the time.

480
00:47:49,230 --> 00:47:54,200
And when it does, a program can either choose to hide here...

481
00:47:54,370 --> 00:47:57,040
...or return to the source.

482
00:47:58,700 --> 00:48:01,970
The machine mainframe. Yes.

483
00:48:02,170 --> 00:48:04,640
Where you must go.

484
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:09,050
Where the path of the One ends. You've seen it...

485
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:13,050
...in your dreams, haven't you?

486
00:48:13,220 --> 00:48:16,050
A door made of light?

487
00:48:18,290 --> 00:48:21,820
What happens when you go through the door?

488
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:26,960
I see Trinity...

489
00:48:27,130 --> 00:48:30,300
...and something happens...

490
00:48:30,470 --> 00:48:32,400
...something bad.

491
00:48:32,570 --> 00:48:36,570
She starts to fall, and then I wake up.

492
00:48:37,610 --> 00:48:41,480
Do you see her die? No.

493
00:48:42,280 --> 00:48:45,310
You have the sight now, Neo.

494
00:48:45,510 --> 00:48:48,480
You are looking at the world without time.

495
00:48:48,680 --> 00:48:51,090
Then why can't I see what happens to her?

496
00:48:51,250 --> 00:48:54,990
We can never see past the choices we don't understand.

497
00:48:55,190 --> 00:48:58,330
Are you saying I have to choose whether Trinity lives or dies?

498
00:48:58,590 --> 00:49:02,360
No, you've already made the choice.

499
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:05,100
Now you have to understand it.

500
00:49:05,730 --> 00:49:07,100
No.

501
00:49:07,270 --> 00:49:10,500
I can't do that. I won't.

502
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:13,610
Well, you have to. Why?

503
00:49:14,210 --> 00:49:17,280
Because you're the One.

504
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:22,450
What if I can't?

505
00:49:22,610 --> 00:49:24,620
What happens if I fail?

506
00:49:25,220 --> 00:49:28,220
Then Zion will fall.

507
00:49:35,660 --> 00:49:40,560
Our time is up. Listen to me, Neo. You can save Zion...

508
00:49:40,730 --> 00:49:44,000
...if you reach the source, but to do that you need the Keymaker.

509
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:45,200
The Keymaker?

510
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:49,000
He disappeared. We didn't know what happened to him until now.

511
00:49:49,210 --> 00:49:52,940
He's being held prisoner by a very dangerous program...

512
00:49:53,110 --> 00:49:56,640
...one of the oldest of us. He is called the Merovingian.

513
00:49:56,810 --> 00:49:59,680
And he won't let him go willingly. What does he want?

514
00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:04,680
What do all men with power want? More power.

515
00:50:05,420 --> 00:50:08,660
Be there at that exact time...

516
00:50:08,820 --> 00:50:11,490
...and you will have a chance.

517
00:50:12,290 --> 00:50:14,530
We must go.

518
00:50:14,730 --> 00:50:20,100
Seems like every time we meet I got nothing but bad news.

519
00:50:20,670 --> 00:50:23,540
I'm sorry about that. I surely am.

520
00:50:23,550 --> 00:50:26,260
But for what it's worth...

521
00:50:27,300 --> 00:50:30,960
...you've made a believer out of me.

522
00:50:32,270 --> 00:50:34,400
Good luck, kiddo.

523
00:50:54,460 --> 00:50:57,460
Mr. Anderson.

524
00:50:58,530 --> 00:51:00,500
Did you get my package?

525
00:51:00,700 --> 00:51:02,830
Yeah. Well, good.

526
00:51:04,030 --> 00:51:06,900
Smith? He's not reading like an agent.

527
00:51:07,060 --> 00:51:10,930
Surprised to see me? No.

528
00:51:11,230 --> 00:51:13,660
Then you're aware of it. Of what?

529
00:51:14,900 --> 00:51:16,900
Our connection.

530
00:51:17,060 --> 00:51:19,730
I don't fully understand how it happened.

531
00:51:19,900 --> 00:51:23,260
Perhaps some part of you imprinted onto me...

532
00:51:23,430 --> 00:51:26,090
...something overwritten or copied.

533
00:51:26,260 --> 00:51:28,960
It is, at this point, irrelevant. What matters is...

534
00:51:29,130 --> 00:51:32,230
...that whatever happened, happened for a reason.

535
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:34,060
And what reason is that?

536
00:51:34,530 --> 00:51:38,460
I killed you, Mr. Anderson. I watched you die.

537
00:51:38,630 --> 00:51:41,890
With a certain satisfaction, I might add.

538
00:51:42,060 --> 00:51:45,560
And then something happened, something that I knew was impossible...

539
00:51:45,730 --> 00:51:47,560
...but it happened anyway.

540
00:51:48,260 --> 00:51:51,430
You destroyed me, Mr. Anderson.

541
00:51:53,430 --> 00:51:58,030
Afterward, I knew the rules, I understood what I was supposed to do...

542
00:51:58,200 --> 00:52:01,190
...but I didn't.

543
00:52:01,590 --> 00:52:05,530
I couldn't. I was compelled to stay...

544
00:52:05,990 --> 00:52:09,530
...compelled to disobey.

545
00:52:10,090 --> 00:52:13,860
And now, here I stand because of you, Mr. Anderson.

546
00:52:14,030 --> 00:52:17,960
Because of you, I'm no longer an agent of this system.

547
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:21,360
Because of you, I've changed. I'm unplugged.

548
00:52:21,530 --> 00:52:26,360
A new man, so to speak. Like you, apparently free.

549
00:52:26,690 --> 00:52:28,060
Congratulations.

550
00:52:28,830 --> 00:52:31,130
Thank you.

551
00:52:31,730 --> 00:52:36,360
But as you well know, appearances can be deceiving...

552
00:52:36,530 --> 00:52:41,690
...which brings me back to the reason why we're here.

553
00:52:41,860 --> 00:52:46,730
We're not here because we're free. We're here because we are not free.

554
00:52:46,890 --> 00:52:50,930
There's no escaping reason, no denying purpose.

555
00:52:50,990 --> 00:52:54,360
Because as we both know, without purpose...

556
00:52:54,530 --> 00:52:59,360
...we would not exist. It is purpose that created us.

557
00:52:59,530 --> 00:53:02,530
Purpose that connects us. Purpose that pulls us.

558
00:53:02,690 --> 00:53:04,520
That guides us. That drives us.

559
00:53:04,690 --> 00:53:09,390
It is purpose that defines. Purpose that binds us.

560
00:53:09,560 --> 00:53:12,020
We are here because of you, Mr. Anderson.

561
00:53:12,190 --> 00:53:16,560
We're here to take from you what you tried to take from us:

562
00:53:18,530 --> 00:53:20,590
Purpose.

563
00:53:23,690 --> 00:53:25,560
What's happening to him? Don't know.

564
00:53:28,630 --> 00:53:32,190
Yes, that's it. It'll be over soon.

565
00:55:18,940 --> 00:55:21,400
You. Yes, me.

566
00:55:25,570 --> 00:55:28,430
Me, me, me.

567
00:55:33,330 --> 00:55:34,960
Me too.

568
00:57:42,610 --> 00:57:43,640
More.

569
00:58:45,860 --> 00:58:48,690
It is inevitable.

570
00:58:49,100 --> 00:58:50,490
Come on, get out of there.

571
00:59:34,190 --> 00:59:36,480
Are you all right?

572
00:59:37,590 --> 00:59:39,520
It was Smith. Yes.

573
00:59:40,390 --> 00:59:43,020
Now there's more than one of them? A lot more.

574
00:59:43,190 --> 00:59:46,950
How is that possible? I don't know.

575
00:59:47,150 --> 00:59:49,580
Somehow, he's found a way to copy himself.

576
00:59:49,750 --> 00:59:53,980
Is that what he was doing to you? I don't know what he was doing...

577
00:59:54,150 --> 00:59:56,880
...but I know what it felt like. What?

578
00:59:57,820 --> 01:00:01,510
It felt like I was back in that hallway.

579
01:00:01,680 --> 01:00:03,080
It felt like dying.

580
01:00:03,580 --> 01:00:06,450
The machines are tunneling to avoid our defense system.

581
01:00:06,650 --> 01:00:10,480
But I believe they will intersect certain pipelines to control them.

582
01:00:10,650 --> 01:00:13,180
These points of intersection are crucial...

583
01:00:13,350 --> 01:00:16,140
...because I believe they're vulnerable to counterattack.

584
01:00:16,310 --> 01:00:20,340
Although it has been suggested that this is the same kind of attack...

585
01:00:20,510 --> 01:00:24,180
...we've defended for years, I urge the Council to realize the truth.

586
01:00:24,340 --> 01:00:27,680
This is the single greatest threat we have ever faced...

587
01:00:27,840 --> 01:00:31,670
...and if we do not act accordingly, we will not survive.

588
01:00:31,840 --> 01:00:35,840
Commander Lock, the Council is well aware of the seriousness of this attack.

589
01:00:36,140 --> 01:00:40,670
You have our leave to prepare our defense by any and all means necessary.

590
01:00:40,840 --> 01:00:43,510
Thank you, Council. However...

591
01:00:43,770 --> 01:00:47,100
...we ask if there's been word from the Nebuchadnezzar.

592
01:00:47,340 --> 01:00:49,840
No, councillor. No word. Nothing.

593
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:55,410
Then we request a ship be dispatched to ascertain the fate of the One.

594
01:00:55,600 --> 01:00:59,340
I wish that were possible, councillor, but I do not believe our defense...

595
01:00:59,500 --> 01:01:03,040
...can suffer the loss of another ship. It will, commander, if it must.

596
01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:05,530
It could take one ship days to find the Nebuchadnezzar.

597
01:01:05,700 --> 01:01:08,730
Then send two. This is insane.

598
01:01:08,940 --> 01:01:11,930
Careful, commander.

599
01:01:12,140 --> 01:01:15,470
Forgive my frustration, councillors.

600
01:01:15,630 --> 01:01:19,500
But I wish I were able to comprehend the Council's choice in this matter.

601
01:01:19,670 --> 01:01:22,830
Comprehension is not a requisite of cooperation.

602
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,460
If you are asking me to order two of my captains...

603
01:01:25,630 --> 01:01:27,330
There's no need for such an order.

604
01:01:27,500 --> 01:01:31,030
The captains are present. They can answer for themselves.

605
01:01:31,500 --> 01:01:36,730
The Council is calling for two volunteers to aid the Nebuchadnezzar.

606
01:01:36,930 --> 01:01:41,090
Are there two among you that would answer such a call?

607
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:46,160
Captain Soren of the Vigilant will answer the Council's call.

608
01:01:46,330 --> 01:01:49,260
You understand the situation, Captain Soren?

609
01:01:49,430 --> 01:01:51,860
Yes, ma'am. Thank you, captain.

610
01:01:53,290 --> 01:01:54,690
Is there another?

611
01:01:55,490 --> 01:01:59,190
Captain, I think we should volunteer. What? You have gone crazy.

612
01:01:59,390 --> 01:02:01,260
Listen... Shut your hole, Bane...

613
01:02:01,430 --> 01:02:02,920
...before I put you in one.

614
01:02:12,760 --> 01:02:14,490
Is there no other?

615
01:02:15,260 --> 01:02:17,150
Be hard for any man to risk his life...

616
01:02:17,350 --> 01:02:20,290
...especially if he doesn't understand the reason.

617
01:02:20,750 --> 01:02:24,250
Captain Niobe of the Logos will answer the councillor's call.

618
01:02:24,420 --> 01:02:26,650
What? Thank you, Captain Niobe.

619
01:02:26,890 --> 01:02:31,950
Commander Lock, you have your orders. This Council is hereby adjourned.

620
01:02:36,680 --> 01:02:39,250
Niobe, what are you doing? What I can.

621
01:02:39,420 --> 01:02:40,450
Why?

622
01:02:41,750 --> 01:02:45,020
Because some things never change, Jason...

623
01:02:45,180 --> 01:02:47,480
...and some things do.

624
01:03:03,910 --> 01:03:05,310
What can you see, Neo?

625
01:03:05,510 --> 01:03:07,810
It's strange. The code is somehow different.

626
01:03:08,010 --> 01:03:09,580
Encrypted? Maybe.

627
01:03:09,750 --> 01:03:11,710
Is that good for us or bad for us?

628
01:03:12,410 --> 01:03:15,540
Well, it looks like every floor is wired with explosives.

629
01:03:16,180 --> 01:03:17,710
Bad for us.

630
01:03:18,140 --> 01:03:19,610
Here we go.

631
01:03:27,640 --> 01:03:30,540
Yes. We are here to speak with the Merovingian.

632
01:03:31,010 --> 01:03:34,840
Well, of course. He has been expecting you.

633
01:03:35,010 --> 01:03:36,040
Follow me.

634
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:03,870
Here he is at last. Neo, the One himself.

635
01:04:04,030 --> 01:04:05,430
Right?

636
01:04:05,630 --> 01:04:08,230
And the legendary Morpheus.

637
01:04:08,800 --> 01:04:13,860
And Trinity, of course. I have heard so much.

638
01:04:13,860 --> 01:04:17,560
You honor me. Please, sit. Join us. This is my wife, Persephone.

639
01:04:18,200 --> 01:04:21,500
Something to eat? Drink?

640
01:04:21,800 --> 01:04:24,830
Of course, such things are contrivances, like so much here.

641
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,500
For the sake of appearances.

642
01:04:27,660 --> 01:04:31,190
No, thank you. Yes, of course. Who has time?

643
01:04:31,300 --> 01:04:36,860
Who has time? But then, if we do not ever take time, how can we ever have time?

644
01:04:40,090 --> 01:04:43,460
Cheau Haut-Briond, 1959. Magnificent wine.

645
01:04:43,630 --> 01:04:46,520
I love French wine like I love the French language.

646
01:04:46,690 --> 01:04:50,860
I have sampled every language. French is my favorite. Fantastic language...

647
01:04:51,030 --> 01:04:53,360
...especially to curse with.

648
01:04:57,940 --> 01:05:01,940
You see? It's like wiping your ass with silk. I love it.

649
01:05:03,820 --> 01:05:05,550
You know why we are here.

650
01:05:07,320 --> 01:05:12,190
I am a trafficker of information. I know everything I can.

651
01:05:12,620 --> 01:05:18,450
The question is, do you know why you are here?

652
01:05:18,750 --> 01:05:21,190
We are looking for the Keymaker.

653
01:05:21,890 --> 01:05:26,350
Oh, yes, it is true. The Keymaker, of course.

654
01:05:26,550 --> 01:05:29,480
But this is not a reason, this is not a why.

655
01:05:29,650 --> 01:05:33,420
The Keymaker himself, his very nature, is a means, it is not an end.

656
01:05:33,580 --> 01:05:39,320
And so to look for him is to be looking for a means to do...

657
01:05:39,480 --> 01:05:42,650
...what? You know the answer to that question.

658
01:05:42,820 --> 01:05:44,950
But do you?

659
01:05:45,150 --> 01:05:47,480
You think you do, but you do not.

660
01:05:47,650 --> 01:05:50,850
You are here because you were sent here.

661
01:05:51,050 --> 01:05:54,140
You were told to come here, and then you obeyed.

662
01:05:55,310 --> 01:05:57,340
It is, of course, the way of all things.

663
01:05:57,510 --> 01:06:00,480
You see, there is only one constant...

664
01:06:00,640 --> 01:06:04,810
...one universal. It is the only real truth.

665
01:06:04,980 --> 01:06:06,640
Causality.

666
01:06:06,840 --> 01:06:09,110
Action, reaction.

667
01:06:09,280 --> 01:06:13,480
Cause and effect. Everything begins with choice.

668
01:06:13,680 --> 01:06:15,410
No. Wrong.

669
01:06:15,580 --> 01:06:20,140
Choice is an illusion created between those with power...

670
01:06:20,340 --> 01:06:22,410
...and those without.

671
01:06:23,940 --> 01:06:27,110
Look there at that woman.

672
01:06:27,840 --> 01:06:31,740
My God, just look at her...

673
01:06:32,010 --> 01:06:34,570
...affecting everyone around her.

674
01:06:34,640 --> 01:06:39,570
So obvious, so bourgeois, so boring. But wait.

675
01:06:39,840 --> 01:06:43,570
Watch. You see, I have sent her a dessert...

676
01:06:43,770 --> 01:06:48,000
...a very special dessert.

677
01:06:52,330 --> 01:06:54,770
I wrote it myself.

678
01:06:54,930 --> 01:06:58,130
It starts so simply...

679
01:06:58,330 --> 01:07:02,900
...each line of the program creating a new effect, just like...

680
01:07:03,930 --> 01:07:05,560
...poetry.

681
01:07:05,730 --> 01:07:07,160
First...

682
01:07:07,670 --> 01:07:13,060
...a rush, heat. Her heart flutters.

683
01:07:13,660 --> 01:07:16,260
You can see it, Neo, yes?

684
01:07:16,900 --> 01:07:19,460
She does not understand why.

685
01:07:19,730 --> 01:07:22,130
Is it the wine? No.

686
01:07:22,330 --> 01:07:24,690
What is it then? What is the reason?

687
01:07:25,330 --> 01:07:27,660
And soon it does not matter.

688
01:07:27,830 --> 01:07:30,830
Soon the why and the reason are gone...

689
01:07:31,790 --> 01:07:37,330
...and all that matters is the feeling itself.

690
01:07:37,790 --> 01:07:40,860
And this is the nature of the universe.

691
01:07:41,030 --> 01:07:43,560
We struggle against it, we fight to deny it...

692
01:07:43,720 --> 01:07:46,320
...but it is, of course, pretense. It is a lie.

693
01:07:46,490 --> 01:07:50,490
Beneath our poised appearance...

694
01:07:50,660 --> 01:07:55,960
...the truth is, we are completely...

695
01:07:58,820 --> 01:08:01,690
...out of control.

696
01:08:07,020 --> 01:08:11,880
Causality. There is no escape from it. We are forever slaves to it.

697
01:08:12,320 --> 01:08:17,780
Our only hope, our only peace, is to understand it, to understand the why.

698
01:08:17,850 --> 01:08:21,350
"Why" is what separates us from them...

699
01:08:21,520 --> 01:08:23,820
...you from me.

700
01:08:23,980 --> 01:08:27,710
"Why" is the only real source of power. Without it, you are powerless.

701
01:08:27,820 --> 01:08:31,180
And this is how you come to me, without why, without power.

702
01:08:31,250 --> 01:08:34,150
Another link in the chain.

703
01:08:34,350 --> 01:08:35,650
But fear not.

704
01:08:35,810 --> 01:08:39,680
Since I have seen how good you are at following orders...

705
01:08:39,850 --> 01:08:42,480
...I will tell you what to do next.

706
01:08:42,980 --> 01:08:47,810
Run back and give the fortuneteller this message:

707
01:08:48,010 --> 01:08:52,280
Her time is almost up.

708
01:08:53,310 --> 01:08:56,840
Now I have some real business to do, so I will say adieu and goodbye.

709
01:08:57,010 --> 01:08:59,510
This isn't over. Oh, yes, it is.

710
01:08:59,680 --> 01:09:06,040
The Keymaker is mine, and I see no reason why I should give him up.

711
01:09:06,240 --> 01:09:10,270
No reason at all. Where are you going?

712
01:09:10,440 --> 01:09:15,140
Please, machie, I have told you. We are all victims of causality.

713
01:09:15,310 --> 01:09:18,640
I drank too much wine, I must take a piss.

714
01:09:19,140 --> 01:09:22,270
Cause and effect. Au revoir.

715
01:09:27,300 --> 01:09:30,400
Touch me and that hand will never touch anything again.

716
01:09:39,270 --> 01:09:40,770
Well, that didn't go so well.

717
01:09:40,940 --> 01:09:43,300
Are you certain the Oracle didn't say anything else?

718
01:09:43,470 --> 01:09:45,600
Yes. Maybe we did something wrong.

719
01:09:46,270 --> 01:09:47,600
Or didn't do something.

720
01:09:47,770 --> 01:09:51,030
No, what happened couldn't have happened any other way.

721
01:09:51,200 --> 01:09:54,960
How do you know? We are still alive.

722
01:09:57,230 --> 01:10:00,460
If you want the Keymaker, follow me.

723
01:10:07,500 --> 01:10:09,560
Get out.

724
01:10:11,500 --> 01:10:17,790
I am so sick and tired of his bullshit. On and on. Pompous prick.

725
01:10:18,390 --> 01:10:23,890
A long time ago, when we first came here, it was so different.

726
01:10:25,660 --> 01:10:28,360
He was so different.

727
01:10:30,160 --> 01:10:32,760
He was like you.

728
01:10:35,490 --> 01:10:39,760
I'll give you what you want, but you have to give me something.

729
01:10:40,020 --> 01:10:42,320
What? A kiss.

730
01:10:42,690 --> 01:10:43,790
Excuse me?

731
01:10:45,320 --> 01:10:49,220
I want you to kiss me as if you were kissing her.

732
01:10:51,160 --> 01:10:54,720
Why? You love her. She loves you.

733
01:10:54,990 --> 01:10:56,920
It's all over you both.

734
01:10:57,590 --> 01:11:02,150
A long time ago, I knew what that felt like.

735
01:11:03,490 --> 01:11:09,220
I want to remember it. I want to sample it. That's all.

736
01:11:09,480 --> 01:11:11,320
Just a sample.

737
01:11:11,480 --> 01:11:14,480
Why don't you sample this instead? Trinity.

738
01:11:16,680 --> 01:11:21,650
Such emotion over something so small. It's just a kiss.

739
01:11:21,820 --> 01:11:23,980
Why should we trust you?

740
01:11:24,150 --> 01:11:28,150
If I don't deliver you to the Keymaker, she can kill me.

741
01:11:35,210 --> 01:11:37,340
All right.

742
01:11:37,650 --> 01:11:41,480
But you have to make me believe I am her.

743
01:11:42,680 --> 01:11:44,710
All right.

744
01:11:51,040 --> 01:11:53,370
Terrible. Forget it.

745
01:11:55,840 --> 01:11:57,310
Wait.

746
01:11:58,240 --> 01:11:59,770
Okay.

1
01:12:36,943 --> 01:12:39,013
Yes.

2
01:12:39,613 --> 01:12:42,113
That's it.

3
01:12:56,873 --> 01:13:02,273
I envy you. But such a thing is not meant to last.

4
01:13:05,273 --> 01:13:06,673
Come with me.

5
01:13:37,703 --> 01:13:39,433
Not again.

6
01:13:42,863 --> 01:13:45,493
It's all right, boys. They're with me.

7
01:13:46,163 --> 01:13:48,533
These fellas work for my husband.

8
01:13:48,693 --> 01:13:52,533
They do his dirty work. They're very good, very loyal.

9
01:13:52,693 --> 01:13:54,223
Aren't you, boys?

10
01:13:54,393 --> 01:13:55,423
Yes, mistress.

11
01:13:55,633 --> 01:13:58,323
They come from a much older version of the Matrix.

12
01:13:58,493 --> 01:14:02,663
But like so many back then, they caused more problems than they solved.

13
01:14:03,393 --> 01:14:08,393
My husband saved them because they're notoriously difficult to terminate.

14
01:14:08,563 --> 01:14:12,623
How many people keep silver bullets in their gun?

15
01:14:17,323 --> 01:14:20,523
You can either run and tell my husband what I have done...

16
01:14:20,693 --> 01:14:23,253
...or you can stay there and die.

17
01:14:24,393 --> 01:14:26,883
He's in the ladies' room!

18
01:14:32,223 --> 01:14:34,153
Hurry.

19
01:14:59,683 --> 01:15:02,843
My name is Neo. Yes. I'm the Keymaker.

20
01:15:03,013 --> 01:15:04,943
I've been waiting for you.

21
01:15:11,783 --> 01:15:15,743
My God! My God, Persephone, how could you do this? You betray me.

22
01:15:19,783 --> 01:15:22,613
Cause and effect, my love. Cause?

23
01:15:22,783 --> 01:15:25,773
There is no cause for this. What cause?

24
01:15:25,943 --> 01:15:30,243
What cause? How about the lipstick you're still wearing?

25
01:15:30,413 --> 01:15:33,113
Lipstick? Lipstick.

26
01:15:33,273 --> 01:15:37,113
What craziness are you talking about, woman? There is no lipstick!

27
01:15:38,813 --> 01:15:41,973
She wasn't kissing your face, my love.

28
01:15:43,943 --> 01:15:47,073
Woman, this is nothing.

29
01:15:47,243 --> 01:15:52,773
It is a game. It is only a game. So is this.

30
01:15:52,943 --> 01:15:54,943
Have fun.

31
01:16:01,433 --> 01:16:03,103
All right.

32
01:16:03,273 --> 01:16:05,003
All right.

33
01:16:05,273 --> 01:16:08,073
Let us find out where this goes.

34
01:16:08,233 --> 01:16:11,103
You two, get the Keymaker.

35
01:16:17,603 --> 01:16:19,603
That's a nice trick.

36
01:16:19,763 --> 01:16:21,063
I cannot go back.

37
01:16:21,603 --> 01:16:23,603
I'll handle them.

38
01:16:24,103 --> 01:16:30,233
Handle us? You'll handle us? You know, your predecessors had much more respect.

39
01:16:43,593 --> 01:16:46,123
Okay, you have some skill.

40
01:16:47,863 --> 01:16:49,793
Kill him.

41
01:17:50,023 --> 01:17:52,593
You see? He's just a man.

42
01:20:06,863 --> 01:20:09,623
Goddamn it, woman, you will be the end of me.

43
01:20:11,763 --> 01:20:15,723
Mark my words, boy, and mark them well.

44
01:20:15,923 --> 01:20:21,123
I have survived your predecessors, and I will survive you.

45
01:20:41,803 --> 01:20:45,163
Where are you going? Another way. Always another way.

46
01:20:49,303 --> 01:20:51,163
Close it, quick!

47
01:20:55,973 --> 01:20:58,503
Could we move along?

48
01:21:02,043 --> 01:21:03,633
Run!

49
01:21:19,573 --> 01:21:21,873
Step away from the door.

50
01:21:26,973 --> 01:21:28,273
We owe you for that.

51
01:21:30,413 --> 01:21:31,543
Just like new.

52
01:21:31,843 --> 01:21:33,313
Drop your weapon.

53
01:21:38,683 --> 01:21:40,513
Stay with him. What about Neo?

54
01:21:40,683 --> 01:21:42,213
He can handle himself.

55
01:21:45,313 --> 01:21:46,383
Get in back.

56
01:22:24,053 --> 01:22:25,223
Shit.

57
01:22:25,723 --> 01:22:27,223
Operator. Link, where am I?

58
01:22:27,753 --> 01:22:30,953
You won't believe this, but you're way up in the mountains.

59
01:22:31,263 --> 01:22:34,053
Really? lt'll take me a while to get an exit.

60
01:22:34,063 --> 01:22:35,093
Shit! What?

61
01:22:35,323 --> 01:22:37,993
The twins are after Morpheus and Trinity. They don't have a way out.

62
01:22:38,163 --> 01:22:41,523
Where are they? Middle of the city, 500 miles due south.

63
01:22:58,303 --> 01:22:59,863
Operator. Get us out of here.

64
01:23:00,033 --> 01:23:02,763
Won't be easy. I know. We're inside the core network.

65
01:23:02,963 --> 01:23:05,563
The only exit I got near you is the Winslow overpass.

66
01:23:05,763 --> 01:23:07,833
Off the freeway. Yes, sir.

67
01:23:08,003 --> 01:23:11,733
Fine, we'll make it. I should... Oh, shit! Look out behind you!

68
01:23:16,773 --> 01:23:18,333
Incoming fire. Down!

69
01:23:26,603 --> 01:23:27,733
Hold on!

70
01:23:44,773 --> 01:23:47,243
Oh, no. This is getting real ugly real fast.

71
01:23:47,443 --> 01:23:49,143
Are you watching this, Link?

72
01:23:49,313 --> 01:23:52,943
Yes, sir. There's an all points on you. Eight units headed your way.

73
01:23:53,983 --> 01:23:55,943
Any suggestions?

74
01:23:57,813 --> 01:23:59,813
Turn right. Right, now.

75
01:24:07,283 --> 01:24:10,113
Straight here. You'll hit a connecting tunnel to the 101.

76
01:24:10,283 --> 01:24:12,983
Got it. You sure about this? The freeway, I mean.

77
01:24:13,183 --> 01:24:16,853
In 14 years of operating, I've never seen... Link, what did I tell you?

78
01:24:17,183 --> 01:24:19,453
Yes, sir. I do, sir. Winslow overpass.

79
01:24:19,613 --> 01:24:22,113
I'll be ready for you. Good man.

80
01:24:22,283 --> 01:24:24,453
You always told me to stay off the freeway.

81
01:24:24,623 --> 01:24:27,253
Yes, that's true. You said it was suicide.

82
01:24:27,453 --> 01:24:29,383
Then let us hope...

83
01:24:29,553 --> 01:24:30,923
...that I was wrong.

84
01:24:42,393 --> 01:24:43,893
Operator. Link, it's Niobe.

85
01:24:44,053 --> 01:24:45,693
We've been sent to bring you in.

86
01:24:45,863 --> 01:24:48,923
I need to talk to Morpheus. Believe me, Niobe, he needs you.

87
01:24:49,093 --> 01:24:51,093
Where is he? Just follow the sirens.

88
01:24:58,663 --> 01:25:00,563
Repeat, they're approaching the...

89
01:25:03,733 --> 01:25:07,933
We have them now. The exile is the primary target.

90
01:26:11,573 --> 01:26:12,513
Shots fired.

91
01:26:15,143 --> 01:26:17,013
Move!

92
01:28:06,973 --> 01:28:10,173
We are getting aggravated. Yes, we are.

93
01:28:56,213 --> 01:28:58,213
Trinity.

94
01:28:58,653 --> 01:28:59,753
Get him out of here.

95
01:29:03,383 --> 01:29:05,453
Come on!

96
01:29:22,493 --> 01:29:23,993
Crush him.

97
01:29:54,693 --> 01:29:55,723
Morpheus.

98
01:29:55,893 --> 01:29:57,393
He's okay. Keep moving.

99
01:29:58,393 --> 01:30:00,193
Let's go.

100
01:30:05,963 --> 01:30:08,093
I need a download to hot-wire a motorcycle.

101
01:30:08,293 --> 01:30:10,593
No problem. One crash course on motorcycle...

102
01:30:10,793 --> 01:30:12,193
Wait.

103
01:30:13,593 --> 01:30:15,023
Cancel that.

104
01:30:15,193 --> 01:30:17,393
You are handy.

105
01:30:17,593 --> 01:30:19,493
Jump on.

106
01:32:46,723 --> 01:32:47,913
She means nothing.

107
01:32:47,923 --> 01:32:51,023
Find the exile. We have them.

108
01:32:51,193 --> 01:32:53,493
One-Adam-12, please respond.

109
01:32:59,963 --> 01:33:01,653
Get down.

110
01:35:12,623 --> 01:35:14,253
Gotcha.

111
01:35:15,013 --> 01:35:16,083
She's good.

112
01:35:20,453 --> 01:35:22,753
You are no longer necessary.

113
01:35:29,423 --> 01:35:33,123
We do only what we're meant to do.

114
01:35:34,753 --> 01:35:38,353
Then you are meant for one more thing: deletion.

115
01:35:39,323 --> 01:35:41,183
Go kick his ass.

116
01:36:31,203 --> 01:36:33,963
Neo, if you're out there, I could use some help.

117
01:36:34,733 --> 01:36:36,163
What is that?

118
01:37:06,043 --> 01:37:08,903
Yes! Yes!

119
01:37:15,503 --> 01:37:17,743
We have confirmation from the Icarus.

120
01:37:17,743 --> 01:37:20,613
First two ships are in position for counterattack.

121
01:37:20,873 --> 01:37:21,873
Good.

122
01:37:22,913 --> 01:37:23,943
Any change?

123
01:37:24,113 --> 01:37:27,043
They hit some iron ore here. Slowed them down a little.

124
01:37:27,043 --> 01:37:30,143
How much? An hour, maybe.

125
01:37:30,353 --> 01:37:33,083
That would give them a little over nine hours.

126
01:37:33,713 --> 01:37:35,313
Yes, sir.

127
01:38:07,973 --> 01:38:10,203
There is a building.

128
01:38:10,373 --> 01:38:16,043
Inside this building, there is a level where no elevator can go...

129
01:38:16,213 --> 01:38:18,113
...and no stair can reach.

130
01:38:18,813 --> 01:38:24,883
This level is filled with doors. These doors lead to many places.

131
01:38:25,053 --> 01:38:27,383
Hidden places.

132
01:38:27,723 --> 01:38:31,353
But one door is special.

133
01:38:31,523 --> 01:38:34,223
One door leads to the source.

134
01:38:42,093 --> 01:38:46,493
This building is protected by a very secure system.

135
01:38:46,663 --> 01:38:51,363
Every alarm triggers the bomb. Bomb? Did he say bomb?

136
01:38:51,433 --> 01:38:54,103
But like all systems, it has a weakness.

137
01:38:54,273 --> 01:38:57,233
The system is based on the rules of a building.

138
01:38:57,433 --> 01:39:00,803
One system built on another. Electricity.

139
01:39:01,343 --> 01:39:06,173
If one fails, so must the other. No electricity, no alarms.

140
01:39:06,173 --> 01:39:09,073
You'd have to take out a city block to kill the power.

141
01:39:09,273 --> 01:39:12,973
Not one, 27. Twenty-seven blocks?

142
01:39:13,813 --> 01:39:16,283
There is a power station.

143
01:39:16,453 --> 01:39:18,683
It must be destroyed.

144
01:39:18,853 --> 01:39:23,183
There must be some kind of fail-safe. Yes, there is an emergency system.

145
01:39:24,823 --> 01:39:28,583
The core network of the grid must be accessed.

146
01:39:28,793 --> 01:39:31,623
The emergency system must be deactivated.

147
01:39:31,793 --> 01:39:33,193
What do you need us for?

148
01:39:33,393 --> 01:39:35,523
Neo could take them out easier than we could.

149
01:39:35,723 --> 01:39:37,463
There's no time. Why?

150
01:39:37,633 --> 01:39:40,763
Once the door is unprotected, the connection will be severed.

151
01:39:40,933 --> 01:39:43,693
But another connection must first be made.

152
01:39:44,063 --> 01:39:47,863
How long will that take? Exactly 314 seconds.

153
01:39:48,373 --> 01:39:49,933
Just over five minutes.

154
01:39:50,103 --> 01:39:52,373
That is the length and breadth of the window.

155
01:39:52,533 --> 01:39:54,803
Only the One can open the door...

156
01:39:55,043 --> 01:39:57,943
...and only during that window can the door be opened.

157
01:39:59,213 --> 01:40:00,773
How do you know all this?

158
01:40:00,943 --> 01:40:06,113
I know because I must know. It is my purpose.

159
01:40:06,313 --> 01:40:11,783
It's the reason I'm here, the same reason we're all here.

160
01:40:22,553 --> 01:40:25,353
Neo, I know something's wrong.

161
01:40:26,023 --> 01:40:28,053
You don't have to tell me.

162
01:40:28,223 --> 01:40:31,953
I just want you to know that I'm here.

163
01:40:35,513 --> 01:40:36,983
All must be done as one.

164
01:40:41,713 --> 01:40:43,383
Can't hurt.

165
01:40:46,943 --> 01:40:49,013
If one fails...

166
01:40:49,813 --> 01:40:51,513
...all fail.

167
01:40:51,843 --> 01:40:55,673
At midnight, there is a shift change in the security of both buildings.

168
01:40:56,913 --> 01:41:00,303
At midnight, we will strike.

169
01:41:00,943 --> 01:41:02,003
Hey!

170
01:41:02,173 --> 01:41:06,143
You count sheep at home. Why? I get paid to count them here.

171
01:41:16,303 --> 01:41:18,503
Okay, they're inside.

172
01:41:18,703 --> 01:41:21,163
How much time? Twelve minutes.

173
01:41:23,903 --> 01:41:24,963
Oh, shit.

174
01:41:28,363 --> 01:41:34,293
All of our lives, we have fought this war. Tonight, I believe we can end it.

175
01:41:35,333 --> 01:41:37,463
Tonight is not an accident.

176
01:41:38,833 --> 01:41:40,793
There are no accidents.

177
01:41:42,193 --> 01:41:47,223
We have not come here by chance. I do not believe in chance.

178
01:41:47,393 --> 01:41:52,953
When I see three objectives, three captains, three ships...

179
01:41:53,153 --> 01:41:56,623
...I do not see coincidence. I see providence.

180
01:41:56,983 --> 01:41:59,323
I see purpose.

181
01:42:02,023 --> 01:42:08,353
I believe it is our fate to be here. It is our destiny.

182
01:42:08,523 --> 01:42:13,513
I believe this night holds for each and every one of us...

183
01:42:13,683 --> 01:42:17,013
...the very meaning of our lives.

184
01:42:17,183 --> 01:42:21,343
I want to ask you to do something, but I don't know how.

185
01:42:21,943 --> 01:42:23,843
I promise you, if I can, I will.

186
01:42:25,173 --> 01:42:28,513
What if I asked you to stay out of this...

187
01:42:29,473 --> 01:42:31,473
...no matter what...

188
01:42:31,643 --> 01:42:33,973
...to stay out of the Matrix?

189
01:42:35,073 --> 01:42:36,843
Why?

190
01:42:45,073 --> 01:42:46,133
Please.

191
01:42:48,233 --> 01:42:49,563
All right.

192
01:42:52,903 --> 01:42:55,363
What is it, Niobe?

193
01:42:55,563 --> 01:42:59,663
I can't help it, Morpheus. I can't help thinking, what if you're wrong?

194
01:42:59,863 --> 01:43:03,133
What if all this, the prophecy, everything, is bullshit?

195
01:43:03,333 --> 01:43:07,293
Then tomorrow we may all be dead.

196
01:43:07,733 --> 01:43:10,863
But how would that be different from any other day?

197
01:43:19,823 --> 01:43:26,323
This is a war, and we are soldiers.

198
01:43:26,553 --> 01:43:29,483
Death can come for us at any time...

199
01:43:30,023 --> 01:43:31,823
...in any place.

200
01:43:31,983 --> 01:43:33,883
Incoming. Incoming!

201
01:43:35,853 --> 01:43:37,483
Incoming!

202
01:43:43,413 --> 01:43:45,843
Now consider the alternative.

203
01:43:46,013 --> 01:43:50,613
What if I am right? What if the prophecy is true?

204
01:43:50,783 --> 01:43:55,173
What if tomorrow the war could be over?

205
01:43:56,143 --> 01:43:59,143
Isn't that worth fighting for?

206
01:44:00,273 --> 01:44:03,373
Isn't that worth dying for?

207
01:44:03,813 --> 01:44:06,443
Time? Three minutes.

208
01:44:06,603 --> 01:44:07,703
Almost there.

209
01:44:27,763 --> 01:44:29,133
It is done.

210
01:44:29,333 --> 01:44:30,593
Find the others.

211
01:44:31,733 --> 01:44:33,963
I got Niobe there. They're out of the station.

212
01:44:34,163 --> 01:44:36,833
What about Soren? There.

213
01:44:36,993 --> 01:44:38,793
They're still inside, but...

214
01:44:39,693 --> 01:44:40,723
They're not moving.

215
01:45:04,853 --> 01:45:06,753
That's it, let's go.

216
01:45:08,923 --> 01:45:10,713
Call Neo now.

217
01:45:14,683 --> 01:45:17,513
I lost them. They're inside the portal. What about the grid?

218
01:45:21,943 --> 01:45:25,443
Everything is operational. The emergency system is rerouting power.

219
01:45:31,113 --> 01:45:33,273
Jesus.

220
01:45:33,443 --> 01:45:37,473
Soon as they open that door, it's all over.

221
01:45:37,673 --> 01:45:39,603
The hell it is.

222
01:45:40,373 --> 01:45:41,703
What are you...? Trinity!

223
01:45:42,503 --> 01:45:45,933
I will not wait and do nothing. I will not watch them die.

224
01:45:46,143 --> 01:45:48,273
Trinity! We're talking less than five minutes.

225
01:45:48,473 --> 01:45:50,933
In five minutes, I'll tear that building down.

226
01:45:51,133 --> 01:45:54,663
How much further? Here, just here.

227
01:45:55,973 --> 01:45:59,933
I'm sorry, this is a dead end.

228
01:46:00,633 --> 01:46:03,593
It's gotta be the ugliest hack I have ever done.

229
01:46:06,333 --> 01:46:09,933
That's as close as I can get you. You better grow wings.

230
01:46:27,993 --> 01:46:29,553
Operator. I'm in.

231
01:46:29,753 --> 01:46:31,883
Keep moving. Sixty-fifth floor.

232
01:46:32,483 --> 01:46:36,653
You look surprised to see me again, Mr. Anderson.

233
01:46:36,823 --> 01:46:42,183
Well, that's the difference between us. I have been expecting you.

234
01:46:42,383 --> 01:46:45,283
What do you want, Smith? You haven't figured that out?

235
01:46:45,453 --> 01:46:50,943
Still using all the muscles except the one that matters.

236
01:46:51,113 --> 01:46:53,783
I want exactly what you want.

237
01:46:53,943 --> 01:46:56,043
I want everything.

238
01:46:56,513 --> 01:46:58,973
Would that include a bullet from this gun?

239
01:46:59,183 --> 01:47:00,943
Go ahead, shoot.

240
01:47:01,113 --> 01:47:06,403
The best thing about being me, there's so many me's.

241
01:47:17,803 --> 01:47:21,403
Christ! What the hell happened in here?

242
01:47:22,303 --> 01:47:24,333
Hold it right there, little lady.

243
01:47:33,663 --> 01:47:35,433
If you can't beat us...

244
01:47:35,633 --> 01:47:37,433
Join us.

245
01:47:39,633 --> 01:47:40,693
Morpheus!

246
01:47:54,293 --> 01:47:57,393
Still no sight of them. They only got two minutes left.

247
01:48:11,083 --> 01:48:12,153
One minute.

248
01:48:21,413 --> 01:48:22,443
Come on.

249
01:48:23,613 --> 01:48:25,543
Come on.

250
01:48:26,113 --> 01:48:27,973
Please.

251
01:48:37,913 --> 01:48:39,443
Kill them.

252
01:48:47,333 --> 01:48:48,373
They're in.

253
01:48:48,533 --> 01:48:50,503
I don't believe it.

254
01:49:06,033 --> 01:49:08,163
It was meant to be.

255
01:49:08,333 --> 01:49:13,693
Morpheus, that door will take you home.

256
01:49:22,463 --> 01:49:26,793
You will know which door. Hurry, Neo.

257
01:49:32,293 --> 01:49:35,453
Trinity, I got some serious activity headed your way.

258
01:50:27,403 --> 01:50:29,263
Hello, Neo.

259
01:50:29,333 --> 01:50:33,593
Who are you? I am the Architect.

260
01:50:33,803 --> 01:50:37,393
I created the Matrix. I've been waiting for you.

261
01:50:37,663 --> 01:50:41,833
You have many questions. Though the process has altered your consciousness...

262
01:50:41,833 --> 01:50:43,993
...you remain irrevocably human.

263
01:50:44,163 --> 01:50:47,723
Ergo, some of my answers you will understand and some you will not.

264
01:50:48,163 --> 01:50:52,193
Concordantly, while your first question may be the most pertinent...

265
01:50:52,363 --> 01:50:56,053
...you may or may not realize it is also the most irrelevant.

266
01:50:56,953 --> 01:50:58,553
Why am I here?

267
01:50:58,753 --> 01:51:02,653
Your life is the sum of a remainder of an unbalanced equation...

268
01:51:02,823 --> 01:51:05,153
...inherent to the programming of the Matrix.

269
01:51:05,323 --> 01:51:09,423
You are the eventuality of an anomaly, which despite my sincerest efforts...

270
01:51:09,583 --> 01:51:12,413
...I've been unable to eliminate from what is otherwise...

271
01:51:12,583 --> 01:51:17,013
...a harmony of mathematical precision.

272
01:51:17,383 --> 01:51:19,683
While it remains a burden assiduously avoided...

273
01:51:19,883 --> 01:51:24,313
...it is not unexpected and thus not beyond a measure of control...

274
01:51:24,513 --> 01:51:28,443
...which has led you, inexorably...

275
01:51:29,413 --> 01:51:30,643
...here.

276
01:51:30,843 --> 01:51:34,913
You haven't answered my question. Quite right.

277
01:51:35,073 --> 01:51:38,843
Interesting. That was quicker than the others.

278
01:51:39,043 --> 01:51:41,643
Others? How many? What others?

279
01:51:41,843 --> 01:51:44,303
The Matrix is older than you know.

280
01:51:44,503 --> 01:51:46,773
I count from the emergence of one integral...

281
01:51:46,773 --> 01:51:48,773
...anomaly to the emergence of the next.

282
01:51:48,773 --> 01:51:50,903
In which case, this is the sixth version.

283
01:51:51,073 --> 01:51:53,533
Five before me? He's lying. Bullshit.

284
01:51:53,703 --> 01:51:57,403
There are only two possible explanations. There were five before me.

285
01:51:57,403 --> 01:51:58,863
Either no one told me...

286
01:51:59,963 --> 01:52:03,933
...or no one knows. Precisely.

287
01:52:04,133 --> 01:52:07,403
As you are undoubtedly gathering, the anomaly is systemic...

288
01:52:07,563 --> 01:52:10,963
...creating fluctuations in even the most simplistic equations.

289
01:52:11,163 --> 01:52:13,263
You can't control me! I'm gonna smash you to bits!

290
01:52:14,593 --> 01:52:16,293
I'm gonna fucking kill you!

291
01:52:16,523 --> 01:52:19,323
You can't make me do anything. You old, white prick!

292
01:52:21,993 --> 01:52:23,493
Choice.

293
01:52:23,663 --> 01:52:25,493
The problem is choice.

294
01:52:47,913 --> 01:52:51,513
The first Matrix I designed was naturally perfect, a work of art.

295
01:52:51,713 --> 01:52:53,513
Flawless, sublime.

296
01:52:53,713 --> 01:52:57,183
A triumph equaled only by its monumental failure.

297
01:52:57,883 --> 01:53:00,273
The inevitability of its doom is apparent now...

298
01:53:00,443 --> 01:53:03,773
...as a consequence of the imperfection inherent in every human.

299
01:53:03,943 --> 01:53:06,913
Thus, I redesigned it based on your history...

300
01:53:07,073 --> 01:53:11,073
...to more accurately reflect the varying grotesqueries of your nature.

301
01:53:11,773 --> 01:53:15,503
However, I was again frustrated by failure.

302
01:53:17,003 --> 01:53:19,603
I have come to understand that the answer eluded me...

303
01:53:19,773 --> 01:53:21,803
...because it required a lesser mind.

304
01:53:22,003 --> 01:53:27,933
Or perhaps, a mind less bound by the parameters of perfection.

305
01:53:28,373 --> 01:53:32,763
Thus, the answer was stumbled upon by another, an intuitive program...

306
01:53:32,963 --> 01:53:37,733
...initially created to investigate certain aspects of the human psyche.

307
01:53:37,903 --> 01:53:43,863
If I am the father of the Matrix, she would undoubtedly be its mother.

308
01:53:44,493 --> 01:53:46,763
The Oracle. Please.

309
01:53:47,493 --> 01:53:51,493
As I was saying, she stumbled upon a solution whereby 99 percent of subjects...

310
01:53:51,663 --> 01:53:54,523
...accepted the program, as long as they were given a choice...

311
01:53:54,693 --> 01:53:58,823
...even if they were only aware of the choice at a near unconscious level.

312
01:53:58,993 --> 01:54:02,393
While this answer functioned, it was fundamentally flawed...

313
01:54:02,593 --> 01:54:06,553
...thus creating the otherwise contradictory systemic anomaly...

314
01:54:06,753 --> 01:54:09,453
...that, if left unchecked, might threaten the system.

315
01:54:09,823 --> 01:54:13,953
Ergo, those that refused the program, while a minority, if unchecked...

316
01:54:14,113 --> 01:54:18,183
...would constitute an escalating probability of disaster.

317
01:54:18,383 --> 01:54:20,153
This is about Zion.

318
01:54:20,613 --> 01:54:24,283
You are here because Zion is about to be destroyed.

319
01:54:24,453 --> 01:54:28,843
Its every living inhabitant terminated, its entire existence eradicated.

320
01:54:29,143 --> 01:54:30,173
Bullshit.

321
01:54:30,383 --> 01:54:33,513
Denial is the most predictable of all human responses.

322
01:54:33,743 --> 01:54:40,173
But rest assured, this will be the sixth time we have destroyed it...

323
01:54:40,373 --> 01:54:44,373
...and we have become exceedingly efficient at it.

324
01:54:56,223 --> 01:54:58,483
The function of the One...

325
01:54:58,533 --> 01:55:03,203
...is now to return to the source, allowing a dissemination of the code you carry...

326
01:55:03,363 --> 01:55:05,063
...reinserting the prime program.

327
01:55:05,663 --> 01:55:09,663
After which you will be required to select from the Matrix 23 individuals...

328
01:55:09,833 --> 01:55:13,063
...sixteen female, seven male, to rebuild Zion.

329
01:55:13,233 --> 01:55:17,763
Failure to comply with this process will result in a cataclysmic system crash...

330
01:55:17,963 --> 01:55:20,263
...killing everyone connected to the Matrix...

331
01:55:20,463 --> 01:55:23,023
...which, coupled with the extermination of Zion...

332
01:55:23,193 --> 01:55:27,393
...will result in the extinction of the entire human race.

333
01:55:27,763 --> 01:55:31,823
You won't let it happen. You can't. You need human beings to survive.

334
01:55:32,623 --> 01:55:36,223
There are levels of survival we are prepared to accept.

335
01:55:36,423 --> 01:55:39,183
The relevant issue is whether or not you are ready...

336
01:55:39,383 --> 01:55:42,953
...to accept the responsibility for the death of every human being in this world.

337
01:55:49,413 --> 01:55:51,953
It is interesting reading your reactions.

338
01:55:52,983 --> 01:55:56,813
Your five predecessors were, by design, based on a similar predication...

339
01:55:56,983 --> 01:56:01,443
...a contingent affirmation that was meant to create a profound attachment...

340
01:56:01,613 --> 01:56:05,173
...to the rest of your species, facilitating the function of the One.

341
01:56:05,373 --> 01:56:07,713
While the others experience this in a general way...

342
01:56:07,873 --> 01:56:10,813
...your experience is far more specific...

343
01:56:11,173 --> 01:56:14,043
...vis-? vis love.

344
01:56:15,043 --> 01:56:16,643
Trinity!

345
01:56:18,943 --> 01:56:23,273
Apropos, she entered the Matrix to save your life at the cost of her own.

346
01:56:23,673 --> 01:56:24,673
No.

347
01:56:25,403 --> 01:56:29,533
Which brings us at last to the moment of truth, wherein the fundamental flaw...

348
01:56:29,703 --> 01:56:32,763
...is ultimately expressed and the anomaly revealed...

349
01:56:32,973 --> 01:56:36,933
...as both beginning and end.

350
01:56:37,133 --> 01:56:38,763
There are two doors.

351
01:56:38,963 --> 01:56:42,163
The door to your right leads to the source and the salvation of Zion.

352
01:56:42,733 --> 01:56:49,023
The door to your left leads back to the Matrix, to her and the end of your species.

353
01:56:49,193 --> 01:56:53,563
As you adequately put, the problem is choice.

354
01:56:53,763 --> 01:56:57,223
But we already know what you are going to do, don't we?

355
01:56:57,423 --> 01:57:01,493
Already I can see the chain reaction, the chemical precursors that signal...

356
01:57:01,653 --> 01:57:06,883
...the onset of an emotion designed specifically to overwhelm logic and reason.

357
01:57:07,093 --> 01:57:11,683
An emotion that is already blinding you from the simple and obvious truth:

358
01:57:11,883 --> 01:57:18,353
She is going to die and there is nothing you can do to stop it.

359
01:57:23,383 --> 01:57:27,483
Hope. It is the quintessential human delusion, simultaneously...

360
01:57:27,683 --> 01:57:31,343
...the source of your greatest strength and your greatest weakness.

361
01:57:31,543 --> 01:57:35,873
If I were you, I would hope that we don't meet again.

362
01:57:36,043 --> 01:57:37,443
We won't.

363
01:57:44,873 --> 01:57:47,073
We got a serious situation, sir.

364
01:57:47,543 --> 01:57:48,603
Oh, no.

365
01:58:48,423 --> 01:58:51,953
What was that? It's moving faster than anything I've seen.

366
01:59:42,533 --> 01:59:44,333
Holy shit, he caught her.

367
01:59:58,263 --> 02:00:00,053
Neo, I had to.

368
02:00:00,253 --> 02:00:01,993
I know.

369
02:00:07,023 --> 02:00:09,553
The bullet is still inside.

370
02:00:20,323 --> 02:00:22,213
Trinity...

371
02:00:23,653 --> 02:00:25,343
...don't you quit on me now.

372
02:00:34,513 --> 02:00:37,073
I'm sorry.

373
02:00:43,613 --> 02:00:45,903
Trinity.

374
02:00:55,873 --> 02:00:57,803
Trinity...

375
02:00:58,003 --> 02:00:59,773
...I know you can hear me.

376
02:01:00,573 --> 02:01:03,103
I'm not letting go.

377
02:01:03,273 --> 02:01:04,903
I can't.

378
02:01:06,103 --> 02:01:08,303
I love you too damn much.

379
02:01:36,993 --> 02:01:38,253
I can't take this.

380
02:01:42,023 --> 02:01:45,083
I guess this makes us even.

381
02:01:57,783 --> 02:01:59,713
I don't understand it.

382
02:01:59,913 --> 02:02:02,883
Everything was done as it was supposed to be done.

383
02:02:03,083 --> 02:02:06,113
Once the One reaches the source, the war should be over.

384
02:02:06,283 --> 02:02:09,113
In 24 hours, it will be. What?

385
02:02:09,283 --> 02:02:13,603
If we don't do something in 24 hours, Zion will be destroyed.

386
02:02:14,043 --> 02:02:15,943
What? How do you know that?

387
02:02:16,113 --> 02:02:18,143
I was told it would happen. By whom?

388
02:02:19,143 --> 02:02:22,173
It doesn't matter. I believed him.

389
02:02:22,173 --> 02:02:25,973
That's impossible. The prophecy tells us... It was a lie, Morpheus.

390
02:02:27,733 --> 02:02:30,273
The prophecy was a lie.

391
02:02:31,503 --> 02:02:34,463
The One was never meant to end anything.

392
02:02:34,673 --> 02:02:37,703
It was all another system of control.

393
02:02:37,863 --> 02:02:40,933
I don't believe that.

394
02:02:41,263 --> 02:02:43,603
But you said it yourself.

395
02:02:43,803 --> 02:02:47,763
How can the prophecy be true if the war isn't over?

396
02:02:53,963 --> 02:02:56,393
I'm sorry.

397
02:02:56,563 --> 02:02:59,923
I know it isn't easy to hear, but...

398
02:03:00,123 --> 02:03:03,253
...I swear to you it's the truth.

399
02:03:06,493 --> 02:03:09,693
What are we gonna do? I don't know.

400
02:03:11,423 --> 02:03:12,583
Oh, no!

401
02:03:21,953 --> 02:03:25,283
What are they doing? They're just out of EMP range.

402
02:03:25,783 --> 02:03:27,013
It's a bomb.

403
02:03:28,213 --> 02:03:30,383
We have to get out of here. Now.

404
02:04:07,263 --> 02:04:09,133
I have dreamed a dream...

405
02:04:12,203 --> 02:04:15,563
...but now that dream has gone from me.

406
02:04:26,593 --> 02:04:28,863
Here they come.

407
02:04:29,093 --> 02:04:30,793
Let's go, Morpheus.

408
02:04:32,223 --> 02:04:35,253
We won't make it. We have to try.

409
02:04:42,993 --> 02:04:45,983
Come on! Something's different.

410
02:04:46,153 --> 02:04:48,153
What?

411
02:04:48,823 --> 02:04:50,313
I can feel them.

412
02:05:13,243 --> 02:05:14,813
Neo!

413
02:05:20,973 --> 02:05:24,573
What happened? I don't know.

414
02:05:29,803 --> 02:05:31,733
It's the Hammer.

415
02:05:43,603 --> 02:05:46,303
He's in some kind of coma...

416
02:05:46,463 --> 02:05:48,733
...but his vitals are stable.

417
02:05:49,933 --> 02:05:51,833
What about you?

418
02:05:52,033 --> 02:05:54,123
I'm fine.

419
02:05:54,293 --> 02:05:56,663
You could use some rest.

420
02:05:56,863 --> 02:05:58,663
No, I'm gonna stay with him.

421
02:06:05,263 --> 02:06:08,393
Lock was right. He guessed that the machines...

422
02:06:08,553 --> 02:06:11,423
...would cut off the mainlines in and out of Zion.

423
02:06:11,593 --> 02:06:14,353
He thought a counterattack might surprise them.

424
02:06:14,593 --> 02:06:18,023
It sounded good. I figured we had a shot...

425
02:06:18,353 --> 02:06:20,483
...until someone screwed it up.

426
02:06:20,553 --> 02:06:23,683
An EMP was triggered before we got in position.

427
02:06:23,753 --> 02:06:27,683
Five ships were instantly downed. When the machines broke through...

428
02:06:27,853 --> 02:06:31,043
...it wasn't a battle, it was a slaughter.

429
02:06:31,113 --> 02:06:34,043
Was it an accident? Some sort of malfunction?

430
02:06:34,113 --> 02:06:36,683
No one knows. Someone does.

431
02:06:36,843 --> 02:06:38,583
Who?

432
02:06:38,783 --> 02:06:42,443
Once the machines were done with us, they started digging again.

433
02:06:42,643 --> 02:06:44,943
We made a quick pass to look for survivors.

434
02:06:45,143 --> 02:06:46,213
You found one?

435
02:06:47,973 --> 02:06:49,673
Only one.
