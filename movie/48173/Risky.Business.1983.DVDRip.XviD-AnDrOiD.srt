1
00:01:38,875 --> 00:01:40,991
The dream is always the same.

2
00:01:41,915 --> 00:01:44,793
Instead of going home,
I go to the neighbors'.

3
00:01:54,395 --> 00:01:56,147
I ring, but nobody answers.

4
00:01:57,355 --> 00:01:59,471
The door is open, so I go inside.

5
00:02:02,635 --> 00:02:05,229
I look around,
but no one seems to be there.

6
00:02:13,995 --> 00:02:16,111
Then I hear the shower running.

7
00:02:16,875 --> 00:02:19,343
So, I go upstairs to see what's what.

8
00:02:39,675 --> 00:02:40,949
Then I see her.

9
00:02:42,475 --> 00:02:43,828
This... girl!

10
00:02:44,115 --> 00:02:45,673
This incredible girl!

11
00:02:47,595 --> 00:02:50,985
I don't know why she's there
because she doesn't live there...

12
00:02:51,595 --> 00:02:53,825
...but it's a dream, so I go with it.

13
00:02:55,635 --> 00:02:57,273
"Who's there?" she says.

14
00:02:58,075 --> 00:02:59,303
"Joel," I say.

15
00:03:00,155 --> 00:03:01,827
"What are you doing here?"

16
00:03:01,915 --> 00:03:03,189
"I don't know.

17
00:03:04,035 --> 00:03:05,707
"What are you doing here?"

18
00:03:06,715 --> 00:03:08,671
"I'm taking a shower," she says.

19
00:03:09,835 --> 00:03:11,427
Then I give her...

20
00:03:11,955 --> 00:03:13,673
..."Do you want me to go?"

21
00:03:14,875 --> 00:03:16,194
"No," she says.

22
00:03:16,275 --> 00:03:18,152
"I want you to wash my back."

23
00:03:20,955 --> 00:03:23,423
I'm getting enthusiastic about this dream.

24
00:03:25,675 --> 00:03:29,111
So, I go to her, but she's hard
to find through all the steam.

25
00:03:29,675 --> 00:03:31,267
I keep losing her.

26
00:03:42,675 --> 00:03:44,552
Finally, I get to the door...

27
00:03:48,555 --> 00:03:52,787
...and I find myself in a room full
of kids taking their College Boards.

28
00:03:54,675 --> 00:03:56,586
I'm over three hours late!

29
00:03:56,795 --> 00:03:59,593
I've got two minutes
to take the whole test.

30
00:04:03,355 --> 00:04:05,425
I've just made a terrible mistake.

31
00:04:06,715 --> 00:04:08,671
I'll never get to college.

32
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:10,314
My life is ruined.

33
00:04:14,155 --> 00:04:17,989
Here's the game: Five-card draw
with a spit. Anaconda, high-low.

34
00:04:19,835 --> 00:04:22,303
Pass two to the right, one to the left...

35
00:04:26,555 --> 00:04:27,783
What happened?

36
00:04:29,835 --> 00:04:30,904
Last night?

37
00:04:31,275 --> 00:04:32,993
That's right, with Kessler.

38
00:04:34,995 --> 00:04:36,713
She was babysitting down the street.

39
00:04:36,795 --> 00:04:37,989
We know that!

40
00:04:38,475 --> 00:04:39,988
So, I went over there.

41
00:04:41,995 --> 00:04:45,192
She was giving the kid a bath
and accidentally hit the shower thing.

42
00:04:45,275 --> 00:04:47,664
All of her clothes were drying upstairs.

43
00:04:51,195 --> 00:04:53,663
So, she plops down on the kitchen floor...

44
00:04:55,915 --> 00:04:57,985
...she looks up at me and says...

45
00:04:58,675 --> 00:05:00,552
..."I think I'm in the mood."

46
00:05:00,835 --> 00:05:02,063
She said that?

47
00:05:03,835 --> 00:05:05,154
What did you say?

48
00:05:06,555 --> 00:05:08,386
I didn't have to say anything.

49
00:05:08,475 --> 00:05:09,749
What did you do?

50
00:05:11,115 --> 00:05:12,753
What do you think I did?

51
00:05:13,275 --> 00:05:16,745
I think you got the hell out of there,
ran home and whacked off!

52
00:05:20,235 --> 00:05:21,554
I disagree.

53
00:05:22,715 --> 00:05:24,626
Did you have your bike there?

54
00:05:26,235 --> 00:05:29,625
I think you jumped on your bike,
pedaled home and whacked off!

55
00:05:32,475 --> 00:05:34,386
That's what you think, right?

56
00:05:34,795 --> 00:05:38,185
With Kessler sitting on the floor like that,
wanting me?

57
00:05:44,475 --> 00:05:45,794
No guts, Goodson.

58
00:05:46,155 --> 00:05:48,874
The problem was I just wasn't attracted
to her.

59
00:05:48,955 --> 00:05:50,274
That should never stop you.

60
00:05:50,355 --> 00:05:51,708
She seemed too big.

61
00:05:51,795 --> 00:05:53,433
It could've worked out.

62
00:05:53,915 --> 00:05:55,667
I thought I'd get into trouble.

63
00:05:55,755 --> 00:05:59,270
Sometimes you have to say,
"What the fuck!" Make your move!

64
00:06:01,435 --> 00:06:03,187
That's easy for you to say.

65
00:06:04,755 --> 00:06:07,508
You're all set.
You're probably going to Harvard.

66
00:06:08,595 --> 00:06:12,031
Me, I don't want to make a mistake,
jeopardize my future!

67
00:06:14,235 --> 00:06:16,191
Joel, let me tell you something.

68
00:06:19,035 --> 00:06:21,754
Every now and then, say, "What the fuck."

69
00:06:23,755 --> 00:06:25,825
"What the fuck," gives you freedom.

70
00:06:26,955 --> 00:06:28,866
Freedom brings opportunity.

71
00:06:29,995 --> 00:06:32,111
Opportunity makes your future.

72
00:06:35,635 --> 00:06:37,068
Be right there.

73
00:06:42,955 --> 00:06:45,185
So, your folks are going out of town?

74
00:06:47,115 --> 00:06:48,104
Tomorrow.

75
00:06:49,515 --> 00:06:51,710
You've got the place all to yourself?

76
00:06:54,395 --> 00:06:55,271
Yeah?

77
00:06:56,235 --> 00:06:57,554
"What the fuck."

78
00:07:03,355 --> 00:07:05,152
If you can't say it...

79
00:07:05,395 --> 00:07:06,828
...you can't do it.

80
00:07:16,635 --> 00:07:18,944
Joel, did you get your SAT scores?

81
00:07:22,035 --> 00:07:23,263
How did you do?

82
00:07:24,075 --> 00:07:25,793
597: Math, 560: Verbal.

83
00:07:28,315 --> 00:07:30,704
If you wanted to,
you could take them again?

84
00:07:30,795 --> 00:07:32,194
- I guess so.
- Great.

85
00:07:32,395 --> 00:07:34,465
Joel, I want to show you something.

86
00:07:35,195 --> 00:07:36,628
Honey, did you pack my Mace?

87
00:07:36,715 --> 00:07:38,433
Yes, in your cosmetic case.

88
00:07:43,635 --> 00:07:45,865
Joel, do you hear something odd?

89
00:07:46,075 --> 00:07:47,554
Something unpleasant?

90
00:07:47,675 --> 00:07:48,471
No.

91
00:07:49,395 --> 00:07:51,590
A preponderance of bass, perhaps?

92
00:07:53,235 --> 00:07:54,031
No.

93
00:07:54,475 --> 00:07:56,705
Is this the way I left the equalizer?

94
00:07:57,155 --> 00:07:57,951
No.

95
00:07:59,315 --> 00:08:01,829
This is not a toy for you and your friends.

96
00:08:04,075 --> 00:08:07,272
If you can't use it properly,
you're not to use it at all.

97
00:08:09,915 --> 00:08:11,507
My house, my rules.

98
00:08:16,555 --> 00:08:18,625
Joel, I spoke to Bill Rutherford.

99
00:08:18,955 --> 00:08:20,707
He interviews for Princeton.

100
00:08:20,795 --> 00:08:22,308
I'll never get into Princeton!

101
00:08:22,395 --> 00:08:24,226
I already arranged an interview.

102
00:08:24,315 --> 00:08:26,545
Friday night, the 4th, at our house.

103
00:08:26,875 --> 00:08:28,149
Jesus, Dad!

104
00:08:29,035 --> 00:08:32,152
Tell him about your involvement
with Future Enterprisers.

105
00:08:32,235 --> 00:08:33,668
They like that.

106
00:08:36,235 --> 00:08:38,544
There's $50 for food,
which is more than enough...

107
00:08:38,635 --> 00:08:41,752
...another $50 for emergencies
and an extra $25 just in case.

108
00:08:41,835 --> 00:08:44,713
Don't forget to water the plants
on the patio.

109
00:08:45,075 --> 00:08:47,191
I made a list, it's on the refrigerator door.

110
00:08:47,275 --> 00:08:48,833
Dad, should I start your car?

111
00:08:48,915 --> 00:08:50,064
The car will be fine, Joel.

112
00:08:50,155 --> 00:08:51,270
For the battery, I mean.

113
00:08:51,355 --> 00:08:54,108
Please, you're not to use my car.
You're not insured for it.

114
00:08:54,195 --> 00:08:56,663
- Use the station wagon.
- Use my car, honey.

115
00:08:57,995 --> 00:08:59,826
Do we understand each other?

116
00:08:59,995 --> 00:09:00,871
Okay!

117
00:09:02,475 --> 00:09:05,831
As far as the house is concerned,
just use your best judgment.

118
00:09:05,915 --> 00:09:07,268
We trust you.

119
00:09:07,435 --> 00:09:08,834
Have a great time.

120
00:09:09,555 --> 00:09:10,510
Be good.

121
00:09:10,635 --> 00:09:12,273
We will, honey. You too.

122
00:10:03,915 --> 00:10:06,634
"Just take those old records off the shelf

123
00:10:07,635 --> 00:10:10,024
"I sit and listen to them by myself

124
00:10:11,475 --> 00:10:13,989
"Today's music ain't got the same soul

125
00:10:14,955 --> 00:10:17,389
"I like that old time rock and roll!

126
00:10:18,795 --> 00:10:21,025
"Don't try to take me to a disco

127
00:10:22,315 --> 00:10:25,034
"You'll never even get me out on the floor

128
00:10:26,155 --> 00:10:28,794
"In ten minutes I'll be late for the door

129
00:10:29,595 --> 00:10:32,029
"I like that old time rock and roll!

130
00:10:33,435 --> 00:10:36,074
"Still like that old time rock and roll!

131
00:10:37,435 --> 00:10:39,995
"That kind of music just soothes the soul

132
00:10:40,955 --> 00:10:43,310
"I reminisce about the days of old

133
00:10:44,715 --> 00:10:47,024
"With that old time rock and roll!"

134
00:11:09,555 --> 00:11:10,670
Guess what?

135
00:11:10,755 --> 00:11:12,393
Dalby got into Harvard.

136
00:11:13,755 --> 00:11:15,347
He must have aced his Boards.

137
00:11:15,435 --> 00:11:16,584
780: Verbal.

138
00:11:16,955 --> 00:11:18,229
765: Math!

139
00:11:18,555 --> 00:11:19,431
Shit!

140
00:11:19,515 --> 00:11:22,075
Do you know what a Harvard MBA makes,
first year?

141
00:11:22,155 --> 00:11:23,110
$40,000.

142
00:11:23,275 --> 00:11:26,745
My cousin went into dermatology.
First year, over $60,000!

143
00:11:27,115 --> 00:11:28,753
Just for squeezing zits?

144
00:11:29,515 --> 00:11:32,473
Why don't you try it, Barry?
You have the experience.

145
00:11:33,915 --> 00:11:35,507
Thank you, you're very kind.

146
00:11:35,595 --> 00:11:37,108
Listen, you guys.

147
00:11:37,515 --> 00:11:39,824
Doesn't anyone want
to accomplish anything?

148
00:11:39,915 --> 00:11:41,985
Or do we just want to make money?

149
00:11:42,715 --> 00:11:43,784
Make money.

150
00:11:44,235 --> 00:11:45,554
Just make money.

151
00:11:46,035 --> 00:11:47,468
Make a lot of money.

152
00:11:47,835 --> 00:11:49,314
What about you, Joel?

153
00:11:51,515 --> 00:11:53,392
Serve my fellow mankind.

154
00:11:59,595 --> 00:12:00,914
Profit motive.

155
00:12:02,875 --> 00:12:04,149
Competition.

156
00:12:05,595 --> 00:12:06,869
Free enterprise.

157
00:12:07,915 --> 00:12:11,032
Is there any company
that doesn't have a product in production?

158
00:12:11,115 --> 00:12:12,628
We're falling far behind.

159
00:12:12,715 --> 00:12:14,068
You haven't exactly been helping.

160
00:12:14,155 --> 00:12:15,588
You wanted to be
the production executive.

161
00:12:15,675 --> 00:12:19,065
Bullshit! Every sales manager I know
helps with production.

162
00:12:19,195 --> 00:12:20,150
Yeah? Who?

163
00:12:20,235 --> 00:12:22,066
Everyone! Just help me
with the production!

164
00:12:22,155 --> 00:12:24,464
I can't! I'm too busy
with marketing and sales!

165
00:12:24,555 --> 00:12:26,273
How can you be busy
with marketing and sales?

166
00:12:26,355 --> 00:12:28,505
I haven't given you the product yet!

167
00:12:28,795 --> 00:12:31,104
Barry, just bring the goddamn thing
over tonight.

168
00:12:31,195 --> 00:12:34,585
I only did this because I thought
it'd look good on my record.

169
00:12:40,635 --> 00:12:42,193
Hi, Glenn. What's up?

170
00:12:42,395 --> 00:12:44,670
- I heard your parents were away.
- Yeah.

171
00:12:46,235 --> 00:12:48,510
I thought maybe I could borrow a room?

172
00:12:50,395 --> 00:12:52,386
Barry is here and we're working.

173
00:12:52,475 --> 00:12:54,067
We won't bother you.

174
00:12:54,395 --> 00:12:56,067
We don't have anywhere to go.

175
00:12:56,155 --> 00:12:57,554
You know how it is.

176
00:12:59,355 --> 00:13:00,913
Sure. Take my room.

177
00:13:02,355 --> 00:13:03,504
Thanks, Joel.

178
00:13:08,875 --> 00:13:09,990
Ready?

179
00:13:10,555 --> 00:13:11,908
The "Memo-Minder"!

180
00:13:13,035 --> 00:13:13,911
Here's how it works.

181
00:13:13,995 --> 00:13:18,068
A call comes in for your mom,
it's fairly important. What do you do?

182
00:13:18,235 --> 00:13:22,387
You write the message down here,
hit the switch... you've got the light.

183
00:13:23,595 --> 00:13:27,144
Now, a call for your dad comes in
and it's really important!

184
00:13:27,755 --> 00:13:30,223
You're gonna get your ass kicked in
if he misses it.

185
00:13:30,315 --> 00:13:31,509
So, what do you do?

186
00:13:31,595 --> 00:13:34,393
Write the message down there,
hit position two...

187
00:13:37,355 --> 00:13:40,586
$1.86 in parts, sell it for $9.95
and make a fortune!

188
00:13:47,755 --> 00:13:49,108
I can't concentrate with this.

189
00:13:49,195 --> 00:13:50,787
This is really annoying.

190
00:13:52,395 --> 00:13:53,794
It's ridiculous!

191
00:13:56,955 --> 00:13:58,274
I'm out of here.

192
00:14:05,675 --> 00:14:07,905
Lock the door when you leave, Glenn.

193
00:14:11,435 --> 00:14:13,266
If you read me, grunt twice!

194
00:14:17,515 --> 00:14:18,470
Thank you!

195
00:14:53,595 --> 00:14:56,155
I can't believe Glenn bringing
Statwiler over like that.

196
00:14:56,235 --> 00:14:57,031
Why?

197
00:14:57,195 --> 00:14:59,709
Because he boffed Hendricks last week!

198
00:15:00,075 --> 00:15:00,951
He did?

199
00:15:01,035 --> 00:15:03,947
Yes! And after the game on Saturday,
he fucked her.

200
00:15:04,955 --> 00:15:06,354
- Barry?
- What?

201
00:15:06,635 --> 00:15:08,910
Boffing and fucking are the same thing.

202
00:15:09,915 --> 00:15:10,950
They are?

203
00:15:12,875 --> 00:15:14,866
Yes. What did you think it was?

204
00:15:15,115 --> 00:15:17,106
I thought it was something else.

205
00:15:17,355 --> 00:15:18,788
You're sure on this?

206
00:15:20,075 --> 00:15:21,269
I'm positive.

207
00:15:24,595 --> 00:15:25,550
Shit!

208
00:15:35,915 --> 00:15:37,234
Sublime breasts.

209
00:15:37,835 --> 00:15:39,029
They're what kind of breasts?

210
00:15:39,115 --> 00:15:40,628
Sublime breasts!

211
00:15:44,475 --> 00:15:46,705
A couple of boys in daddy's car.

212
00:15:47,355 --> 00:15:48,788
Do you want to race?

213
00:15:55,035 --> 00:15:55,990
Hit it.

214
00:16:17,195 --> 00:16:18,310
Okay. Good.

215
00:16:19,115 --> 00:16:22,312
You've done the old man's car bit.
That's a good start.

216
00:16:24,715 --> 00:16:26,626
Now, try this on for size.

217
00:16:29,035 --> 00:16:30,468
"The Leather Castle.

218
00:16:31,515 --> 00:16:34,313
"Chicago's finest dominants
and submissives.

219
00:16:35,275 --> 00:16:38,108
"Fully equipped dungeons.
Beginners welcome."

220
00:16:40,075 --> 00:16:41,713
It sounds great, Miles.

221
00:16:42,635 --> 00:16:43,909
Here's one!

222
00:16:43,995 --> 00:16:46,304
"My daddy used to spank my bare bottom.

223
00:16:48,075 --> 00:16:50,748
"Now he's gone. Will you take his place?

224
00:16:51,515 --> 00:16:52,709
"Call Misty."

225
00:16:52,955 --> 00:16:55,913
Come on, Joel. You've got to
take advantage of this!

226
00:16:56,395 --> 00:16:57,908
They come to your house!

227
00:16:57,995 --> 00:17:01,704
"Countess Angelique seeks
young submissive with large ankles!"

228
00:17:02,795 --> 00:17:03,910
This is it!

229
00:17:04,075 --> 00:17:07,750
"For a good time in the privacy
of your own home, call Jackie:

230
00:17:08,395 --> 00:17:09,669
"555-4875."

231
00:17:11,515 --> 00:17:14,746
Succinct, to the point,
down to business. What do you say?

232
00:17:18,555 --> 00:17:20,944
If you want to call, call for yourself.

233
00:17:22,795 --> 00:17:24,228
A good time, Joel!

234
00:17:25,115 --> 00:17:27,265
In the privacy of your own home!

235
00:17:27,915 --> 00:17:29,667
What else can you ask for?

236
00:17:30,955 --> 00:17:33,025
I'll make my own calls, thank you.

237
00:17:33,795 --> 00:17:34,944
Then...

238
00:17:35,675 --> 00:17:36,630
...call!

239
00:17:36,955 --> 00:17:37,990
Forget it!

240
00:17:41,195 --> 00:17:42,389
Forget it!

241
00:17:42,955 --> 00:17:44,229
All right!

242
00:17:44,715 --> 00:17:45,830
I'm calling.

243
00:17:47,435 --> 00:17:48,709
You're calling?

244
00:17:49,675 --> 00:17:51,267
Someday you'll thank me for this.

245
00:17:51,355 --> 00:17:53,186
You'd better not mention me.

246
00:17:54,795 --> 00:17:56,706
It's her answering machine.

247
00:17:57,115 --> 00:18:00,107
Hi, Jackie, this is Joel Goodson,
345 Remson, Glencoe.

248
00:18:00,635 --> 00:18:03,468
I'd like a good time in my home tonight.
Bye!

249
00:18:09,035 --> 00:18:10,514
That was really cute.

250
00:18:11,595 --> 00:18:13,506
Now, give me the number
so I can call her back.

251
00:18:13,595 --> 00:18:15,586
Number? There's no number?

252
00:18:17,035 --> 00:18:18,866
Give me the number, damn it!

253
00:18:21,995 --> 00:18:23,428
There's no number.

254
00:18:25,035 --> 00:18:26,434
You're an asshole!

255
00:18:26,955 --> 00:18:28,946
Gotta go. Catch you later.

256
00:18:33,315 --> 00:18:34,509
Shithead!

257
00:19:39,635 --> 00:19:40,750
Oh, God!

258
00:19:56,995 --> 00:19:59,509
Hello, Joel. I'm Jackie. How are you?

259
00:20:02,515 --> 00:20:04,824
Nice to meet you, Jackie. I'm not Joel.

260
00:20:04,915 --> 00:20:06,871
Joel stepped out for a moment.

261
00:20:08,355 --> 00:20:09,674
I'll go call him.

262
00:20:17,155 --> 00:20:18,190
Holy shit!

263
00:20:21,955 --> 00:20:24,071
Dalby, get your ass over here!

264
00:20:24,515 --> 00:20:26,107
I'm playing cards, Joel!

265
00:20:26,355 --> 00:20:27,708
Just get over here!

266
00:20:27,795 --> 00:20:28,989
Is she there?

267
00:20:29,075 --> 00:20:31,635
Yes, she is here,
and she is waiting for you!

268
00:20:32,035 --> 00:20:34,754
She's not waiting for me,
she's waiting for you.

269
00:20:35,395 --> 00:20:36,623
Are you coming?

270
00:20:37,475 --> 00:20:39,067
No! I'm playing cards!

271
00:20:40,835 --> 00:20:42,234
You're not coming?

272
00:20:44,755 --> 00:20:46,234
Get over here, Dalby!

273
00:20:59,555 --> 00:21:02,149
Look, I'm sorry about
the misunderstanding.

274
00:21:03,955 --> 00:21:06,423
Joel, be a courageous person.
Open the door!

275
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:08,745
That way, you see, I can call a cab.

276
00:21:09,795 --> 00:21:11,387
Again, I'm really sorry.

277
00:21:11,875 --> 00:21:15,550
As long as we come to an arrangement,
I'm in no mood for complaining.

278
00:21:15,635 --> 00:21:18,195
I mean, when you put
your good money down...

279
00:21:18,275 --> 00:21:21,392
...you gotta get what you wanted
in the first place. Know what I mean?

280
00:21:21,475 --> 00:21:24,512
When you buy a TV,
you don't buy Sony if you want RCA.

281
00:21:26,035 --> 00:21:28,424
I know we could get along
real well. But, hey!

282
00:21:28,515 --> 00:21:30,790
It's your hard-earned money, right?

283
00:21:31,555 --> 00:21:34,831
This way, we make an arrangement
and everyone is satisfied.

284
00:21:35,155 --> 00:21:36,429
You had carfare.

285
00:21:36,515 --> 00:21:39,348
A long ride. I don't ever come out this far.

286
00:21:40,515 --> 00:21:41,550
And your time.

287
00:21:41,635 --> 00:21:44,752
My time, my effort,
my infinite patience and understanding.

288
00:21:44,835 --> 00:21:45,790
Thank you.

289
00:21:45,875 --> 00:21:46,830
$75.

290
00:21:48,755 --> 00:21:49,710
Fair enough.

291
00:21:49,795 --> 00:21:52,184
Joel, I'm going to give you a number.

292
00:21:52,915 --> 00:21:54,473
You ask for Lana.

293
00:21:55,355 --> 00:21:57,266
- It's what you want.
- Thank you.

294
00:21:59,395 --> 00:22:01,909
It's what every white boy
off the lake wants.

295
00:22:32,515 --> 00:22:35,075
All right, Goodson,
we know you're in there!

296
00:22:35,635 --> 00:22:36,750
What's that?

297
00:22:37,875 --> 00:22:39,706
I think someone's out there.

298
00:22:46,195 --> 00:22:48,106
Joel, the house is surrounded.

299
00:22:49,315 --> 00:22:51,875
Do exactly as we say,
and no one gets hurt.

300
00:22:52,675 --> 00:22:53,630
Oh, shit!

301
00:22:53,715 --> 00:22:58,106
Get off the babysitter! Put on your
pants, and come out with your hands up!

302
00:23:05,075 --> 00:23:06,906
Please, Joel, do as they say!

303
00:23:08,555 --> 00:23:10,193
Get off the babysitter!

304
00:23:10,275 --> 00:23:12,505
Don't throw your life away like this.

305
00:23:14,755 --> 00:23:19,146
Listen, you goddamn punk, you'll never
have a future! Not if I can help it!

306
00:23:20,195 --> 00:23:22,106
You got that? No future!

307
00:23:22,915 --> 00:23:24,189
Who is that?

308
00:23:24,595 --> 00:23:25,630
My father!

309
00:24:20,355 --> 00:24:21,754
Hello? Lana?

310
00:24:23,075 --> 00:24:23,871
Yes?

311
00:24:25,395 --> 00:24:26,191
Hi.

312
00:24:38,915 --> 00:24:41,304
I'm a nice guy,
and I'd like to meet you tonight.

313
00:24:41,395 --> 00:24:42,908
Fine. Where are you?

314
00:24:45,875 --> 00:24:47,228
Where do you live?

315
00:24:51,155 --> 00:24:52,110
Glencoe.

316
00:24:53,155 --> 00:24:54,474
What's your name?

317
00:24:59,955 --> 00:25:00,865
Ralph.

318
00:25:01,955 --> 00:25:04,071
Ralph, can I have the address?

319
00:25:10,435 --> 00:25:11,345
345...

320
00:25:13,355 --> 00:25:14,424
...Remson.

321
00:25:15,715 --> 00:25:16,625
Ralph?

322
00:25:19,475 --> 00:25:20,954
I'll see you tonight.

323
00:26:57,435 --> 00:26:59,346
Are you ready for me, Ralph?

324
00:28:53,555 --> 00:28:56,627
This is a beautiful place, Ralph.
Is it all yours?

325
00:28:57,395 --> 00:28:59,033
It's my folks', actually.

326
00:28:59,955 --> 00:29:01,866
Do you know what it's worth?

327
00:29:03,995 --> 00:29:05,189
A lot, probably.

328
00:29:05,275 --> 00:29:06,867
Oh, yeah! Real estate?

329
00:29:07,195 --> 00:29:08,423
It's fabulous!

330
00:29:09,235 --> 00:29:11,829
Look, Lana... my name really isn't Ralph.

331
00:29:15,675 --> 00:29:16,949
It's Joel.

332
00:29:18,235 --> 00:29:19,907
I need $300... Joel.

333
00:29:22,995 --> 00:29:24,064
You're kidding?

334
00:29:24,155 --> 00:29:25,668
No, I don't believe I am.

335
00:29:25,755 --> 00:29:27,347
Can I send it to you?

336
00:29:30,235 --> 00:29:32,112
Can you send it to me, Joel?

337
00:29:32,635 --> 00:29:35,513
I just don't have that much here
in the house.

338
00:29:36,315 --> 00:29:38,067
How much do you have?

339
00:29:38,995 --> 00:29:40,553
- I have $50.
- $50?

340
00:29:41,835 --> 00:29:43,905
What are we going to do about this?

341
00:29:49,875 --> 00:29:51,433
I have a bond at the bank I could cash...

342
00:29:51,515 --> 00:29:53,585
I'm not good at waiting for people.

343
00:29:54,995 --> 00:29:56,189
I'll be quick.

344
00:29:56,635 --> 00:29:57,909
Give it a try.

345
00:30:36,155 --> 00:30:37,190
I'm back!

346
00:30:49,955 --> 00:30:51,274
I'm here for you.

347
00:31:11,155 --> 00:31:13,225
How could she? It's so stupid!

348
00:31:13,555 --> 00:31:14,908
Tell your mother it broke!

349
00:31:14,995 --> 00:31:17,589
That egg is worth a lot more than $300!

350
00:31:18,515 --> 00:31:20,153
What are you going to do?

351
00:31:20,755 --> 00:31:22,950
I'm gonna get it back,
is what I'm gonna do.

352
00:31:23,035 --> 00:31:23,751
Are you going to help?

353
00:31:23,835 --> 00:31:24,950
Sure. When?

354
00:31:26,675 --> 00:31:27,710
Right now!

355
00:31:27,955 --> 00:31:31,152
I can't do it right now!
I have a trig. Mid-term tomorrow!

356
00:31:31,675 --> 00:31:33,028
Hey, "Mr. What-The-Fuck"...

357
00:31:33,115 --> 00:31:35,424
...what about "exploring
the dark side" and all that?

358
00:31:35,515 --> 00:31:37,233
Or was that just bullshit?

359
00:31:37,715 --> 00:31:39,592
That was just bullshit, Joel.

360
00:31:41,275 --> 00:31:43,470
I'm surprised you listened to me.

361
00:31:48,955 --> 00:31:50,229
Are you coming?

362
00:31:58,675 --> 00:32:01,064
How can you even tell if she'll be here?

363
00:32:02,235 --> 00:32:04,874
I called Jackie and she said to try here.

364
00:32:06,355 --> 00:32:09,904
Great idea. Where else could
we get a hot chocolate for $4?

365
00:32:12,115 --> 00:32:13,184
She's here!

366
00:32:14,595 --> 00:32:15,710
Where?

367
00:32:16,755 --> 00:32:18,950
The blue dress... those legs...

368
00:32:20,635 --> 00:32:21,750
That's her.

369
00:32:21,875 --> 00:32:23,388
She's fantastic!

370
00:32:32,955 --> 00:32:34,627
She's looking right at us!

371
00:32:43,195 --> 00:32:44,674
She knows we're here.

372
00:32:54,515 --> 00:32:55,789
That's it?

373
00:32:56,715 --> 00:32:58,034
That's it, Joel?

374
00:33:01,075 --> 00:33:03,873
I can't believe we came
all the way here for that!

375
00:33:05,915 --> 00:33:07,906
At least she knows we're on to her, Miles.

376
00:33:07,995 --> 00:33:09,792
Yeah, she must be terrified.

377
00:33:09,875 --> 00:33:10,910
Joel!

378
00:33:14,555 --> 00:33:15,874
Is this your car?

379
00:33:16,795 --> 00:33:17,705
Maybe.

380
00:33:19,635 --> 00:33:21,273
Could we talk a minute?

381
00:33:21,715 --> 00:33:22,750
Okay.

382
00:33:23,595 --> 00:33:24,664
Let's talk!

383
00:33:25,075 --> 00:33:27,669
Okay. In the car, all right? It's freezing.

384
00:33:38,875 --> 00:33:40,513
Will you do me a favor?

385
00:33:41,595 --> 00:33:43,426
You want me to do you a favor?

386
00:33:43,515 --> 00:33:44,743
I just need a lift.

387
00:33:44,835 --> 00:33:46,507
Look, I want my egg back!

388
00:33:49,395 --> 00:33:50,510
Get out of the car!

389
00:33:50,595 --> 00:33:51,869
Joel, better get moving.

390
00:33:51,955 --> 00:33:53,308
I want my egg back!

391
00:33:53,395 --> 00:33:55,147
You got it, all right? Just start driving!

392
00:33:55,235 --> 00:33:56,065
When?

393
00:33:56,595 --> 00:33:58,028
- Now!
- Open the door!

394
00:33:58,755 --> 00:33:59,870
When do I get it back?

395
00:33:59,955 --> 00:34:01,104
Start driving!

396
00:34:01,195 --> 00:34:03,709
Open the door!
Are you going to open the door?

397
00:34:03,795 --> 00:34:04,910
Hey, buster!

398
00:34:05,355 --> 00:34:06,151
Fuck! Will you just...

399
00:34:06,235 --> 00:34:08,191
- Get off the car!
- Just start driving!

400
00:34:08,275 --> 00:34:09,674
Start driving, now!

401
00:34:11,155 --> 00:34:13,191
Why don't you start the car, Joel?

402
00:34:14,195 --> 00:34:15,548
Fuck! Get out of here!

403
00:34:15,635 --> 00:34:17,546
Start the goddamn car, Joel!

404
00:34:17,875 --> 00:34:19,308
Lana, open the door.

405
00:34:21,395 --> 00:34:23,113
Where are you going? Lana!

406
00:34:23,315 --> 00:34:25,033
Get out, or I'll kill you!

407
00:34:35,955 --> 00:34:37,308
Who was that guy?

408
00:34:37,555 --> 00:34:38,829
My manager.

409
00:34:39,435 --> 00:34:41,505
He gets a little crazy sometimes.

410
00:34:42,915 --> 00:34:44,587
This is my friend, Miles.

411
00:34:46,835 --> 00:34:48,746
Do you like excitement, Miles?

412
00:34:49,075 --> 00:34:50,030
Love it.

413
00:35:07,035 --> 00:35:08,946
Okay, where do you want to go?

414
00:35:09,715 --> 00:35:12,866
I don't know, Joel.
I haven't given it a lot of thought.

415
00:35:12,955 --> 00:35:14,149
Tell me this:

416
00:35:14,355 --> 00:35:16,391
Am I going in the right direction?

417
00:35:18,355 --> 00:35:19,993
Oh, shit! Here he comes!

418
00:35:20,355 --> 00:35:21,583
Here who comes?

419
00:35:22,195 --> 00:35:23,708
That manager guy?

420
00:35:27,635 --> 00:35:28,704
Hey, Guido!

421
00:35:29,115 --> 00:35:30,594
Big man, Guido!

422
00:35:31,635 --> 00:35:33,034
Big man with a gun!

423
00:35:33,235 --> 00:35:34,429
What are you going to do?

424
00:35:34,515 --> 00:35:36,028
Shoot us all? Stupid!

425
00:35:40,435 --> 00:35:41,993
This guy Guido...

426
00:35:42,515 --> 00:35:44,585
...he's a "manager"?
- That's right.

427
00:35:45,395 --> 00:35:46,464
Or a pimp?

428
00:35:46,675 --> 00:35:48,267
Now, that's quick, Joel.

429
00:35:48,675 --> 00:35:51,394
Have you always been this quick,
or is this something new?

430
00:35:51,475 --> 00:35:52,988
I don't believe this!

431
00:35:53,075 --> 00:35:54,633
I have a trig. Mid-term tomorrow...

432
00:35:54,715 --> 00:35:57,513
...and I'm being chased by Guido,
The Killer Pimp!

433
00:36:21,875 --> 00:36:22,785
Miles?

434
00:36:24,275 --> 00:36:25,264
I think I can take him.

435
00:36:25,355 --> 00:36:26,993
What are you talking...

436
00:36:55,995 --> 00:36:57,826
I'm really not enjoying this.

437
00:37:17,235 --> 00:37:19,146
I think I'm going to throw up.

438
00:37:28,155 --> 00:37:30,669
I think I'm going to throw up on you, Joel!

439
00:37:51,795 --> 00:37:53,069
Porsche...

440
00:37:53,275 --> 00:37:54,947
...there is no substitute.

441
00:37:57,795 --> 00:37:58,864
Fuck you.

442
00:38:03,275 --> 00:38:05,072
Hi, dear. It's Mother.

443
00:38:05,195 --> 00:38:06,423
How are you?

444
00:38:06,515 --> 00:38:08,870
Just checking in to say hello,
see how you're doing...

445
00:38:08,955 --> 00:38:11,230
...and give you our flight information.

446
00:38:12,955 --> 00:38:15,549
Wait a minute. Let me write this down.

447
00:38:16,915 --> 00:38:19,383
Saturday, United, Flight 162 at 3:30.

448
00:38:21,435 --> 00:38:25,189
That's right. How's everything else?
Do you have enough money?

449
00:38:26,195 --> 00:38:29,073
It never seems to go as far
as you think it will.

450
00:38:30,915 --> 00:38:32,268
Yes, I know.

451
00:38:32,795 --> 00:38:34,194
I'm learning, Mom.

452
00:38:36,155 --> 00:38:37,474
How is Aunt Tudi?

453
00:38:41,955 --> 00:38:43,104
I will.

454
00:38:44,315 --> 00:38:45,714
See you then, bye.

455
00:38:48,115 --> 00:38:49,389
Your folks?

456
00:38:50,675 --> 00:38:52,108
So, how are they?

457
00:38:52,435 --> 00:38:54,073
Oh, they're just great.

458
00:38:54,195 --> 00:38:55,628
How about Aunt Tudi?

459
00:38:55,795 --> 00:38:58,309
Her hip is much better.
She sends her love.

460
00:39:03,675 --> 00:39:05,631
You were telling me about Guido.

461
00:39:05,955 --> 00:39:07,149
I quit Guido.

462
00:39:09,715 --> 00:39:10,750
How come?

463
00:39:15,355 --> 00:39:17,027
He thought he owned me.

464
00:39:18,515 --> 00:39:19,743
Nobody owns me.

465
00:39:23,515 --> 00:39:26,825
The problem is, I owe him for clothes
and hospital bills.

466
00:39:27,075 --> 00:39:28,747
You were in the hospital?

467
00:39:30,195 --> 00:39:31,594
I had this...

468
00:39:32,475 --> 00:39:33,669
...pain in my chest.

469
00:39:33,755 --> 00:39:35,871
I thought it was a heart condition.

470
00:39:37,755 --> 00:39:38,870
What was it?

471
00:39:39,155 --> 00:39:40,793
The doctor said nerves.

472
00:39:41,235 --> 00:39:42,634
Nice service.

473
00:39:43,515 --> 00:39:44,743
Reed & Barton.

474
00:39:47,515 --> 00:39:49,904
Thank you for breakfast. It was good.

475
00:39:52,155 --> 00:39:53,793
I'm going to school now.

476
00:39:59,115 --> 00:40:00,992
I'll have to ask you to leave.

477
00:40:04,555 --> 00:40:05,624
I'm sorry.

478
00:40:06,715 --> 00:40:08,228
You won't let me stay?

479
00:40:09,435 --> 00:40:11,346
No, I have to go to school.

480
00:40:15,675 --> 00:40:17,233
I'm really sorry.

481
00:40:21,435 --> 00:40:22,629
No, I'm sorry.

482
00:40:28,035 --> 00:40:29,434
I'll be right back.

483
00:40:32,715 --> 00:40:34,546
You guys go ahead without me.

484
00:40:35,235 --> 00:40:36,463
She's still here?

485
00:40:36,555 --> 00:40:37,874
She won't leave.

486
00:40:41,355 --> 00:40:42,674
She won't leave.

487
00:40:47,915 --> 00:40:49,348
Lana, look...

488
00:40:50,395 --> 00:40:53,148
...I just want my egg back.
I want my house back.

489
00:40:54,235 --> 00:40:55,953
I have a lot of work to do.

490
00:40:58,155 --> 00:41:00,271
Did you have a good time last night?

491
00:41:03,675 --> 00:41:05,825
You mean when we got back here?

492
00:41:06,795 --> 00:41:08,626
I think you know what I mean.

493
00:41:14,875 --> 00:41:16,513
I had a great time.

494
00:41:19,755 --> 00:41:22,144
Don't tell me I owe you another $300.

495
00:41:24,195 --> 00:41:26,106
Did I say you owe me anything?

496
00:41:28,635 --> 00:41:29,272
No, you didn't.

497
00:41:29,355 --> 00:41:32,074
I don't remember saying
you owe me anything.

498
00:41:37,755 --> 00:41:39,666
What about my mother's egg?

499
00:41:40,395 --> 00:41:43,592
You're the one who's going to college,
you figure it out.

500
00:41:47,715 --> 00:41:49,353
How much time do you need?

501
00:41:49,435 --> 00:41:52,029
I need long enough
to make a few phone calls.

502
00:41:52,315 --> 00:41:54,875
I have to figure out how
to get my stuff back.

503
00:41:54,955 --> 00:41:58,106
Guido has probably locked me
out of the apartment by now.

504
00:41:58,475 --> 00:41:59,544
All right!

505
00:42:01,355 --> 00:42:03,107
But will you do me a favor?

506
00:42:03,595 --> 00:42:04,914
Anything, cookie.

507
00:42:06,915 --> 00:42:08,553
Don't steal anything!

508
00:42:11,235 --> 00:42:13,988
If I come back here,
and find anything missing...

509
00:42:15,115 --> 00:42:18,027
...l'm going straight to the police.
I'm not joking!

510
00:42:18,955 --> 00:42:21,344
Joel, go to school. Go learn something.

511
00:42:35,755 --> 00:42:37,586
May I see your pass, please!

512
00:42:39,355 --> 00:42:42,552
I'm sure you've all read
chapters six through eight...

513
00:42:42,955 --> 00:42:45,344
...so here's a little pop quiz to confirm it.

514
00:42:45,435 --> 00:42:47,995
Will you put your books on the floor,
please?

515
00:43:09,915 --> 00:43:11,143
You didn't tell anyone, did you?

516
00:43:11,235 --> 00:43:12,554
No. Glenn knows.

517
00:43:13,155 --> 00:43:14,224
What about Barry?

518
00:43:14,315 --> 00:43:15,543
He knows, too.

519
00:43:15,835 --> 00:43:17,393
Don't tell anyone!

520
00:43:17,835 --> 00:43:19,188
I won't! I won't!

521
00:43:28,555 --> 00:43:31,752
Lab reports should be on my desk
by tomorrow afternoon.

522
00:43:32,715 --> 00:43:34,910
I won't accept any that aren't typed.

523
00:43:49,675 --> 00:43:51,825
Term papers are due on Friday.

524
00:43:51,915 --> 00:43:54,475
They count for 50%
of this semester's grades.

525
00:43:56,635 --> 00:43:57,590
Damn it!

526
00:44:06,955 --> 00:44:08,070
Hey, Miles, what's going on?

527
00:44:08,155 --> 00:44:09,668
I'm waiting for Glenn.

528
00:44:09,915 --> 00:44:11,143
Glenn? Where is he?

529
00:44:11,235 --> 00:44:12,190
Inside.

530
00:44:12,955 --> 00:44:14,149
In the house?

531
00:44:14,235 --> 00:44:15,748
He wanted to meet her!

532
00:44:17,955 --> 00:44:18,944
What are you doing?

533
00:44:19,035 --> 00:44:19,990
I was inside.

534
00:44:20,075 --> 00:44:21,349
I can see that.

535
00:44:24,235 --> 00:44:25,748
You're home now.

536
00:44:26,155 --> 00:44:27,986
Yeah, I live here, remember?

537
00:44:30,715 --> 00:44:31,625
Glenn?

538
00:44:35,035 --> 00:44:37,185
Tell me you didn't do anything with her.

539
00:44:37,275 --> 00:44:38,310
Who, Lana?

540
00:44:38,875 --> 00:44:39,944
Yeah, Lana.

541
00:44:40,155 --> 00:44:41,144
Nothing.

542
00:44:41,235 --> 00:44:42,509
I met her.

543
00:44:42,835 --> 00:44:43,904
She's nice.

544
00:44:44,475 --> 00:44:46,545
You're sure you didn't do anything?

545
00:44:46,955 --> 00:44:48,229
Yeah, I swear.

546
00:44:48,675 --> 00:44:50,950
You did it with her, didn't you, Glenn?

547
00:44:51,275 --> 00:44:53,505
I did not do it with her, Joel!

548
00:45:00,315 --> 00:45:01,714
Ask me about Vicki!

549
00:45:03,235 --> 00:45:04,304
Who is Vicki?

550
00:45:04,395 --> 00:45:05,669
Owe you one!

551
00:45:09,515 --> 00:45:12,154
Are you Joel? Nice place you have here.

552
00:45:13,675 --> 00:45:14,790
Where's Lana?

553
00:45:14,875 --> 00:45:15,944
In the den.

554
00:45:16,035 --> 00:45:17,434
I like your friend!

555
00:45:19,035 --> 00:45:20,707
Get out! I'm not kidding!

556
00:45:21,115 --> 00:45:22,548
What's your problem?

557
00:45:24,675 --> 00:45:26,347
Just leave! Please!

558
00:45:27,115 --> 00:45:29,675
Look, we're not ripping you off or anything.

559
00:45:33,995 --> 00:45:35,189
What is this for?

560
00:45:35,275 --> 00:45:37,789
Fifty goes to the house! You're the house!

561
00:45:39,835 --> 00:45:41,507
I am not the house!

562
00:45:43,115 --> 00:45:44,867
Just leave! I mean it!

563
00:45:46,795 --> 00:45:48,114
He's mad, Vicki.

564
00:45:48,395 --> 00:45:50,147
Already? I just got here!

565
00:45:50,635 --> 00:45:52,307
I think he wants us to go.

566
00:45:52,715 --> 00:45:54,194
Do you want us to go?

567
00:45:57,795 --> 00:45:58,830
Thank you.

568
00:46:23,915 --> 00:46:25,587
I don't want any problems.

569
00:46:25,835 --> 00:46:27,666
Do you know what
you did to me last night?

570
00:46:27,755 --> 00:46:28,949
I don't care!

571
00:46:31,595 --> 00:46:33,984
I don't want to see you
or do anything with you anymore.

572
00:46:34,075 --> 00:46:35,303
Get in the car!

573
00:46:57,915 --> 00:46:58,950
Excuse me.

574
00:47:00,475 --> 00:47:01,988
What can I do for you?

575
00:47:02,595 --> 00:47:03,710
Who are you?

576
00:47:09,795 --> 00:47:11,945
Are you the kid I chased last night?

577
00:47:13,755 --> 00:47:16,030
Is there something I can help you with?

578
00:47:16,635 --> 00:47:18,466
You shouldn't drive like that.

579
00:47:18,555 --> 00:47:20,671
People get hurt all the time.

580
00:47:21,835 --> 00:47:23,553
Are you a smart kid?

581
00:47:24,515 --> 00:47:26,233
You look like a smart kid.

582
00:47:26,435 --> 00:47:27,663
I'm okay.

583
00:47:27,755 --> 00:47:29,586
Where are the girls? Inside?

584
00:47:32,075 --> 00:47:34,635
I'm afraid I'll have to ask you to leave.

585
00:47:39,355 --> 00:47:40,993
The door is locked.

586
00:47:41,955 --> 00:47:43,786
You're starting to give me a stomachache.

587
00:47:43,875 --> 00:47:45,513
Good! I hope it hurts!

588
00:47:46,635 --> 00:47:47,988
Are you going to open the door?

589
00:47:48,075 --> 00:47:50,509
Guido, go home!
We don't need you anymore!

590
00:47:50,635 --> 00:47:51,954
Shut your mouth!

591
00:47:52,555 --> 00:47:55,069
Listen, maybe we don't work
for you anymore!

592
00:47:56,835 --> 00:47:58,063
Then who do you work for?

593
00:47:58,155 --> 00:48:00,225
Who? If you don't work for me?

594
00:48:00,715 --> 00:48:02,546
Maybe we work for Joel, now.

595
00:48:04,395 --> 00:48:05,794
She's only kidding.

596
00:48:06,315 --> 00:48:07,384
I hope so.

597
00:48:09,515 --> 00:48:11,745
Joel, you look like a smart kid.

598
00:48:13,435 --> 00:48:16,666
I'm going to tell you something
I'm sure you'll understand.

599
00:48:17,595 --> 00:48:19,506
You're having fun now, right?

600
00:48:20,475 --> 00:48:22,625
Right, Joel? The time of your life.

601
00:48:24,475 --> 00:48:28,593
In a sluggish economy, never, ever fuck
with another man's livelihood!

602
00:48:30,635 --> 00:48:33,229
If you're smart, like I hope you are...

603
00:48:36,395 --> 00:48:38,989
...you aren't going to make me
come back here.

604
00:48:47,275 --> 00:48:48,594
Thank you, Joel.

605
00:48:51,755 --> 00:48:53,108
It's very decent of you.

606
00:48:53,195 --> 00:48:55,629
Just as long as we understand each other.

607
00:48:55,915 --> 00:48:58,793
One night, then you'll find another place
to stay.

608
00:48:59,115 --> 00:49:01,390
As soon as we get in touch with Tandy,
we'll have a place.

609
00:49:01,475 --> 00:49:03,864
- Did you try her again?
- She's still out.

610
00:49:04,315 --> 00:49:05,748
And my mother's egg?

611
00:49:06,315 --> 00:49:08,909
If I can get my stuff back, I can get the egg.

612
00:49:09,995 --> 00:49:11,269
Then you'll leave?

613
00:49:11,355 --> 00:49:12,674
Then we'll leave.

614
00:49:13,835 --> 00:49:16,668
I don't know, Lana.
He has such nice friends.

615
00:49:17,035 --> 00:49:18,627
Clean, polite, quick.

616
00:49:19,755 --> 00:49:21,632
I think there's a future here.

617
00:49:39,835 --> 00:49:41,348
What are you studying?

618
00:49:42,635 --> 00:49:44,227
It's a workshop...

619
00:49:44,955 --> 00:49:46,468
...on free enterprise.

620
00:49:52,515 --> 00:49:55,473
We make a product,
and then we try to market it.

621
00:49:58,395 --> 00:50:00,113
Do you make a lot of money?

622
00:50:01,035 --> 00:50:02,354
No. Not really.

623
00:50:05,955 --> 00:50:07,104
No, but we...

624
00:50:08,315 --> 00:50:10,704
...get to compete with other
student companies.

625
00:50:10,795 --> 00:50:12,353
Actually, it's fucked!

626
00:50:13,315 --> 00:50:14,907
I'm just kidding.

627
00:50:16,035 --> 00:50:17,946
It's really quite competitive.

628
00:50:22,075 --> 00:50:23,793
Do you ever get high, Joel?

629
00:50:25,675 --> 00:50:27,108
Yeah. All the time.

630
00:50:27,835 --> 00:50:30,793
You see, Vicki and I were thinking
about getting high.

631
00:50:31,915 --> 00:50:34,634
Maybe going out
and getting some ice cream?

632
00:50:37,195 --> 00:50:38,514
You want to come?

633
00:50:43,835 --> 00:50:46,224
I could go for some ice cream right now.

634
00:50:58,275 --> 00:50:59,503
Are you stoned?

635
00:50:59,915 --> 00:51:01,826
No. I do not believe so.

636
00:51:04,035 --> 00:51:05,912
I think you're really wasted!

637
00:51:06,795 --> 00:51:08,751
This is not wasted, Barry.

638
00:51:09,155 --> 00:51:11,032
This is definitely not wasted.

639
00:51:15,835 --> 00:51:16,745
Barry?

640
00:51:20,395 --> 00:51:22,511
- I'm a little wasted!
- I know.

641
00:51:25,755 --> 00:51:28,349
- Don't let me do anything stupid.
- Don't worry.

642
00:51:32,155 --> 00:51:33,588
Want to take a walk?

643
00:51:40,315 --> 00:51:42,226
How do you like living at home?

644
00:51:44,475 --> 00:51:45,749
It's okay.

645
00:51:46,075 --> 00:51:47,588
I'll be out next year.

646
00:51:47,835 --> 00:51:49,951
I'll bet your folks are nice.

647
00:51:50,435 --> 00:51:52,346
They're gone till Sunday?

648
00:51:52,795 --> 00:51:53,625
Yeah.

649
00:51:54,875 --> 00:51:56,752
Because, I was thinking...

650
00:51:57,195 --> 00:51:58,787
I mean, after your friend came over...

651
00:51:58,875 --> 00:52:00,513
...I couldn't believe it!

652
00:52:00,675 --> 00:52:02,745
A kid our age walks in with a $100!

653
00:52:03,995 --> 00:52:04,905
Glenn.

654
00:52:05,635 --> 00:52:07,830
Where did he get that kind of change?

655
00:52:08,155 --> 00:52:09,304
I don't know.

656
00:52:10,435 --> 00:52:12,346
He said he cashed a bond.

657
00:52:13,635 --> 00:52:15,546
You people have a lot of bonds.

658
00:52:19,075 --> 00:52:20,633
So, I was thinking...

659
00:52:22,435 --> 00:52:25,871
...if we ever got our friends together,
we'd make a fortune!

660
00:52:26,875 --> 00:52:28,308
Yeah. You're right.

661
00:52:29,915 --> 00:52:31,553
Do you want to do that?

662
00:52:31,875 --> 00:52:32,751
Do what?

663
00:52:32,835 --> 00:52:35,395
Get our friends together
in the next few days.

664
00:52:37,435 --> 00:52:39,232
No. I don't think so.

665
00:52:41,435 --> 00:52:44,154
Make some money. Be a little enterpriser.

666
00:52:44,635 --> 00:52:46,034
Future enterpriser.

667
00:52:47,715 --> 00:52:49,467
Be whatever you want to be.

668
00:52:55,355 --> 00:52:58,745
What if I said I'd be your girlfriend
for the next few nights?

669
00:52:59,675 --> 00:53:00,710
No charge?

670
00:53:03,195 --> 00:53:05,663
Hey, I'm not pushing you on the idea.

671
00:53:06,555 --> 00:53:09,115
It's just that my mind keeps working
all the time.

672
00:53:09,195 --> 00:53:12,551
Nothing I can do about it.
It keeps working and working.

673
00:53:25,515 --> 00:53:26,834
You warm enough?

674
00:53:27,035 --> 00:53:28,070
I'm okay.

675
00:53:34,275 --> 00:53:35,913
How come you left home?

676
00:53:37,915 --> 00:53:38,711
Why?

677
00:53:40,035 --> 00:53:41,514
I was just wondering.

678
00:53:45,115 --> 00:53:47,868
Because my step-father
kept coming on to me.

679
00:53:50,715 --> 00:53:52,626
What else do you want to know?

680
00:53:56,635 --> 00:53:58,865
Do you have any brothers and sisters?

681
00:54:00,315 --> 00:54:01,873
I have a brother.

682
00:54:02,395 --> 00:54:03,464
What else?

683
00:54:04,635 --> 00:54:06,148
If you don't want to talk...

684
00:54:06,235 --> 00:54:07,429
No, no. Ask me anything.

685
00:54:07,515 --> 00:54:09,665
I don't think you want to talk and it's okay.

686
00:54:09,755 --> 00:54:11,825
No, I really want to talk to you.

687
00:54:15,035 --> 00:54:16,309
What does he do?

688
00:54:17,275 --> 00:54:18,594
He's in school.

689
00:54:21,155 --> 00:54:23,066
How come you're not in school?

690
00:54:23,515 --> 00:54:24,914
I'm not my brother.

691
00:54:31,435 --> 00:54:33,824
I'm really trying to be friends with you.

692
00:54:33,915 --> 00:54:37,032
But I'd appreciate it if you'd
stop trying to judge me...

693
00:54:37,115 --> 00:54:39,993
...while you're leaning on your
daddy's $40,000 car.

694
00:54:44,035 --> 00:54:45,468
I'll see you around.

695
00:54:52,155 --> 00:54:53,747
Was it something I said?

696
00:55:00,195 --> 00:55:03,232
You locked the door!
The keys are inside the car!

697
00:55:04,035 --> 00:55:06,071
Please! Stop! Stop! Stop!

698
00:55:22,235 --> 00:55:24,146
Please stop! Please stop!

699
00:55:55,355 --> 00:55:56,629
Thank you.

700
00:55:56,835 --> 00:55:57,904
Thank you.

701
00:56:39,355 --> 00:56:41,505
All right, everyone watch your feet!

702
00:56:58,595 --> 00:56:59,789
Are you okay?

703
00:57:02,875 --> 00:57:04,513
Do you want an aspirin?

704
00:57:08,475 --> 00:57:10,067
Does your dad own a gun?

705
00:57:14,395 --> 00:57:16,113
Who's the U-boat commander?

706
00:57:30,075 --> 00:57:33,624
You're right. You are absolutely
right to respond this way.

707
00:57:34,715 --> 00:57:36,751
I did not have a doctor's appointment.

708
00:57:36,835 --> 00:57:39,303
But I will tell you exactly what happened.

709
00:57:39,835 --> 00:57:41,348
"Unexcused." You see, Nurse Bolan...

710
00:57:41,435 --> 00:57:44,313
...lf you write "unexcused,"
I fail two mid-terms.

711
00:57:44,475 --> 00:57:46,864
It'll wreck my whole grade point average!

712
00:57:47,835 --> 00:57:51,464
If you'd just stop and listen to me,
I'll explain everything.

713
00:57:57,155 --> 00:58:00,465
The truth is, my parents are away,
and I met this girl.

714
00:58:02,395 --> 00:58:04,955
A call girl, actually.
She came to my house.

715
00:58:06,715 --> 00:58:08,387
Look, you're writing again!

716
00:58:08,475 --> 00:58:10,067
This is not "unexcused"!

717
00:58:11,355 --> 00:58:14,984
If you will just listen to me,
then you'll understand, Nurse Bolan.

718
00:58:16,635 --> 00:58:18,466
Why? Why won't you listen to me?

719
00:58:18,555 --> 00:58:20,432
I had a doctor's appointment.

720
00:58:24,795 --> 00:58:25,830
Excuse me.

721
00:58:26,715 --> 00:58:29,468
It wasn't the girl, it was my father's car.

722
00:58:30,235 --> 00:58:32,066
I put my father's car into Lake Michigan...

723
00:58:32,155 --> 00:58:34,066
...and I had to get it fixed.

724
00:58:36,475 --> 00:58:37,988
Just give me a break.

725
00:58:42,715 --> 00:58:44,353
Let me put it this way.

726
00:58:44,635 --> 00:58:49,106
I have spent the last four years
of my life busting my butt in this shithole!

727
00:58:52,475 --> 00:58:53,510
I'm sorry.

728
00:58:53,755 --> 00:58:57,953
I don't think I can leave until I get
just a little compassion from you.

729
00:59:03,995 --> 00:59:05,223
What did he get?

730
00:59:05,315 --> 00:59:07,112
Suspension, five days.

731
00:59:08,195 --> 00:59:09,913
They kicked him out
of Future Enterprisers, too.

732
00:59:09,995 --> 00:59:12,065
Shit! They trashed his whole record!

733
00:59:12,155 --> 00:59:14,305
What's he going to do about the car?

734
00:59:17,915 --> 00:59:19,507
Are you okay, Joel?

735
00:59:21,275 --> 00:59:22,469
I'm okay.

736
00:59:32,675 --> 00:59:33,903
I need a bike.

737
00:59:34,475 --> 00:59:35,430
He needs a bike.

738
00:59:35,515 --> 00:59:37,983
- Glenn, can I borrow your bike?
- Jesus, Glenn!

739
00:59:38,075 --> 00:59:39,588
Sure. Here, use mine.

740
01:02:03,875 --> 01:02:06,105
It was great the way her mind worked:

741
01:02:06,275 --> 01:02:08,186
No guilt, no doubts, no fear.

742
01:02:09,075 --> 01:02:10,667
None of my specialties.

743
01:02:14,355 --> 01:02:17,870
Just this shameless pursuit of immediate
material gratification.

744
01:02:19,155 --> 01:02:20,508
What a capitalist!

745
01:02:23,795 --> 01:02:27,629
She told me I could make more money
in one night than I'd make all year.

746
01:02:27,715 --> 01:02:29,751
Enough to pay for my father's car.

747
01:02:30,195 --> 01:02:32,265
She told me she'd be my girlfriend.

748
01:02:35,395 --> 01:02:37,351
She told me a lot of things.

749
01:02:37,435 --> 01:02:38,868
I believed them all.

750
01:02:39,795 --> 01:02:41,990
So, she introduced me to her friends.

751
01:02:47,475 --> 01:02:49,227
"Now when I was a young boy

752
01:02:51,075 --> 01:02:52,508
"At the age of five

753
01:02:54,275 --> 01:02:56,345
"My mother said I was going to be

754
01:02:57,475 --> 01:02:59,113
"The greatest man alive

755
01:03:00,675 --> 01:03:02,188
"But now I'm a man

756
01:03:04,115 --> 01:03:05,628
"Way past twenty-one

757
01:03:07,235 --> 01:03:09,146
"I want you to believe me, baby

758
01:03:10,435 --> 01:03:11,948
"I have lots of fun

759
01:03:13,795 --> 01:03:14,910
"I'm a man"

760
01:03:17,875 --> 01:03:19,786
I introduced her to my friends.

761
01:03:27,235 --> 01:03:29,146
We made Barry our treasurer.

762
01:03:32,195 --> 01:03:33,628
Lana did production.

763
01:03:34,755 --> 01:03:36,632
I concentrated on sales.

764
01:03:37,715 --> 01:03:39,910
So, you took her out to dinner twice.

765
01:03:40,275 --> 01:03:42,027
What did that cost you?

766
01:03:42,435 --> 01:03:43,470
About $30.

767
01:03:43,555 --> 01:03:44,544
With tip?

768
01:03:44,755 --> 01:03:46,029
Okay, maybe $35.

769
01:03:46,515 --> 01:03:47,834
Any movies?

770
01:03:48,275 --> 01:03:49,469
Three movies.

771
01:03:49,635 --> 01:03:50,670
$20.

772
01:03:51,795 --> 01:03:52,750
Parking?

773
01:03:52,835 --> 01:03:54,314
I park on the street.

774
01:03:54,595 --> 01:03:55,425
Gas?

775
01:03:56,995 --> 01:03:58,189
Maybe $6.

776
01:04:00,435 --> 01:04:03,154
All right, Stan, you're in for roughly $60.

777
01:04:09,675 --> 01:04:10,869
What happened?

778
01:04:12,355 --> 01:04:13,993
She slept with Jacobsen.

779
01:04:18,035 --> 01:04:19,593
That's all I'm saying.

780
01:04:21,875 --> 01:04:23,752
"I can make love to you, woman

781
01:04:24,915 --> 01:04:26,507
"In five minutes' time

782
01:04:28,035 --> 01:04:29,434
"Ain't that a man?"

783
01:04:35,795 --> 01:04:38,025
Do you know what he said... afterwards?

784
01:04:39,635 --> 01:04:41,865
He said the lady had knowledge.

785
01:04:42,315 --> 01:04:44,510
He was glad to get that knowledge.

786
01:04:44,835 --> 01:04:46,154
Do you know why?

787
01:04:46,515 --> 01:04:47,345
Why?

788
01:04:47,955 --> 01:04:50,833
Because college girls can smell ignorance...

789
01:04:51,795 --> 01:04:53,114
...like dog shit.

790
01:04:53,635 --> 01:04:55,068
I'll think about it.

791
01:04:55,955 --> 01:04:57,308
Where are you going to school next year?

792
01:04:57,395 --> 01:04:58,464
Wisconsin.

793
01:04:58,835 --> 01:05:00,109
Wisconsin?

794
01:05:01,475 --> 01:05:02,544
Big school.

795
01:05:21,395 --> 01:05:23,113
All I'm saying is...

796
01:05:24,435 --> 01:05:25,868
...walk like a man.

797
01:05:52,915 --> 01:05:55,031
Joel! This is a great party!

798
01:05:56,835 --> 01:05:58,553
Are you having a good time?

799
01:06:06,595 --> 01:06:08,984
Excellent idea, Joel! Really excellent.

800
01:06:15,235 --> 01:06:17,795
Some of the girls are wearing
my mother's clothing.

801
01:06:17,875 --> 01:06:19,069
What's wrong with that?

802
01:06:19,155 --> 01:06:21,191
I don't want to spend the rest
of my life in analysis.

803
01:06:21,275 --> 01:06:23,391
- Just talk to them, okay?
- All right.

804
01:07:06,515 --> 01:07:07,994
Is Howie Rifkin here?

805
01:07:08,395 --> 01:07:09,748
You're on, honey.

806
01:07:31,755 --> 01:07:34,315
Joel! Somebody is at the front door
for you.

807
01:07:34,635 --> 01:07:37,149
All right, thank you. I'll be right there.

808
01:07:38,195 --> 01:07:39,674
The thing is...

809
01:07:41,075 --> 01:07:42,952
...I don't have to pay for it.

810
01:07:45,515 --> 01:07:46,789
I get it anyway.

811
01:07:52,235 --> 01:07:54,829
I'm going to get going
or I'll miss the party.

812
01:07:59,915 --> 01:08:01,906
Whatever you want to do...

813
01:08:15,595 --> 01:08:17,392
Excuse me. Can I help you?

814
01:08:17,995 --> 01:08:19,144
Are you Joel?

815
01:08:19,795 --> 01:08:20,591
Yes.

816
01:08:20,755 --> 01:08:22,552
Bill Rutherford, Princeton Admissions.

817
01:08:22,635 --> 01:08:24,990
I believe we had an interview scheduled.

818
01:08:25,515 --> 01:08:27,392
If this is inconvenient for you...

819
01:08:27,475 --> 01:08:28,908
No, sir. It's fine.

820
01:08:38,795 --> 01:08:40,706
Is it okay if I have the room?

821
01:08:43,915 --> 01:08:46,873
Also, could you catch the phone
if anyone calls, please?

822
01:08:46,955 --> 01:08:49,913
I understand that you would like
to attend Princeton.

823
01:08:50,955 --> 01:08:52,627
Yes, sir, very much.

824
01:08:52,995 --> 01:08:54,314
Well, fine.

825
01:08:54,995 --> 01:08:57,509
Let's take a look at what we have,
shall we?

826
01:09:10,995 --> 01:09:12,474
Does this couch open?

827
01:09:13,235 --> 01:09:14,588
Lana, I'm in a meeting.

828
01:09:14,675 --> 01:09:15,994
We need the room.

829
01:09:16,715 --> 01:09:18,706
I need a few minutes, okay?

830
01:09:24,435 --> 01:09:26,665
Now, you've taken your SAT's already.

831
01:09:26,995 --> 01:09:31,068
Math: 597, Verbal: 560. Correct me
if my information is inaccurate.

832
01:09:32,555 --> 01:09:35,627
Well, yes, but I was planning on taking
those again.

833
01:09:35,755 --> 01:09:38,588
Fine. Now, your grade point
average is 3.14.

834
01:09:39,755 --> 01:09:41,393
You class rank: 52...

835
01:09:41,715 --> 01:09:45,025
...which places you in the 84th percentile.
Is that correct?

836
01:09:45,835 --> 01:09:48,395
Joel, this is my cousin, Ruben,
from Skokie.

837
01:09:48,715 --> 01:09:49,909
Can you get him in tonight?

838
01:09:49,995 --> 01:09:51,269
Not now, okay?

839
01:09:51,435 --> 01:09:54,347
- He has to be back by 12:00.
- All right, later guys.

840
01:09:59,875 --> 01:10:00,910
Excuse me.

841
01:10:03,115 --> 01:10:04,867
And you wish to major in?

842
01:10:07,435 --> 01:10:08,470
Business.

843
01:10:09,395 --> 01:10:10,874
Business. Yes.

844
01:10:15,635 --> 01:10:17,273
I'll be out in a second.

845
01:10:21,835 --> 01:10:24,429
Fine, well, let's see what else there is.

846
01:10:24,875 --> 01:10:28,584
"Junior Varsity Tennis Team,
Recording Secretary, Spanish Club...

847
01:10:30,995 --> 01:10:33,111
"...Varsity Track Team: One year...

848
01:10:33,195 --> 01:10:35,993
"...Honorable Mention:
Cook County Science Fair...

849
01:10:37,355 --> 01:10:39,869
"...Future Enterprisers, Yearbook Staff...

850
01:10:41,715 --> 01:10:43,751
"...Student Council: Two years."

851
01:10:45,515 --> 01:10:47,983
Well, Joel, this is very respectable.

852
01:10:49,515 --> 01:10:51,904
You've done some very solid work here...

853
01:10:52,915 --> 01:10:55,304
...but it isn't quite lvy League, is it?

854
01:11:00,755 --> 01:11:02,313
You know, Bill...

855
01:11:03,755 --> 01:11:06,667
...there's one thing I've learned
in all my years.

856
01:11:07,275 --> 01:11:09,994
Sometimes you have to say,
"What the fuck."

857
01:11:10,995 --> 01:11:12,223
Make your move.

858
01:11:14,315 --> 01:11:15,714
I beg your pardon?

859
01:11:17,995 --> 01:11:19,508
So, how are we doing?

860
01:11:20,235 --> 01:11:22,271
Looks like University of Illinois!

861
01:11:22,475 --> 01:11:24,227
"All right, all right!

862
01:11:24,915 --> 01:11:26,951
"Dance, Music, Sex, Romance!

863
01:11:27,755 --> 01:11:29,985
"Everybody say, Oooh, all right!

864
01:11:33,035 --> 01:11:35,071
"Dance, Music, Sex, Romance!

865
01:11:39,115 --> 01:11:41,345
"Everybody clap your hands now!"

866
01:12:03,475 --> 01:12:05,909
Some of your friends are looking for you.

867
01:12:08,595 --> 01:12:10,631
What do you want me to tell them?

868
01:12:13,875 --> 01:12:16,070
Has that guy from Princeton left yet?

869
01:12:16,275 --> 01:12:19,187
No, he's still here.
He's talking to some of the girls.

870
01:12:19,275 --> 01:12:20,230
Talking?

871
01:12:20,875 --> 01:12:22,593
They're very good talkers.

872
01:12:25,515 --> 01:12:28,587
I don't think I'm going to say,
"What the fuck" anymore.

873
01:12:29,515 --> 01:12:31,983
This thing has gotten way out of control.

874
01:12:34,675 --> 01:12:36,313
I'm going to kill Miles.

875
01:12:37,035 --> 01:12:38,468
Oh, come on, Joel.

876
01:12:41,075 --> 01:12:44,067
Look at it this way.
You're making a lot of money.

877
01:12:44,715 --> 01:12:47,309
You're providing your friends
with an invaluable service.

878
01:12:47,395 --> 01:12:49,465
God knows, they needed the service!

879
01:12:50,515 --> 01:12:53,905
And, right now, you are one hot-shit
future enterpriser.

880
01:12:58,355 --> 01:13:00,949
Don't worry so much. I'll be upstairs.

881
01:13:04,555 --> 01:13:06,944
And... you have a girlfriend to boot.

882
01:13:08,035 --> 01:13:08,911
Do I?

883
01:13:08,995 --> 01:13:10,633
Phone call for Joel.

884
01:13:10,835 --> 01:13:12,188
Here, I'll get it.

885
01:13:13,075 --> 01:13:14,144
Well, do I?

886
01:13:16,515 --> 01:13:17,868
What do you think?

887
01:13:18,355 --> 01:13:20,073
I don't know. You tell me.

888
01:13:20,355 --> 01:13:21,708
Yes? No? Maybe?

889
01:13:23,875 --> 01:13:24,751
Yes.

890
01:13:27,395 --> 01:13:28,191
No.

891
01:13:31,475 --> 01:13:32,385
Maybe.

892
01:13:36,995 --> 01:13:37,871
Joel!

893
01:13:39,075 --> 01:13:39,905
Dad?

894
01:13:40,035 --> 01:13:41,707
Who answered the phone?

895
01:13:41,795 --> 01:13:43,228
Just a friend, Dad.

896
01:13:43,395 --> 01:13:44,430
Do I know her?

897
01:13:44,515 --> 01:13:46,187
Have you ever made love on a real train?

898
01:13:46,275 --> 01:13:47,594
I don't think so.

899
01:13:48,035 --> 01:13:49,354
He's got a girl.

900
01:13:49,955 --> 01:13:51,911
Let's make love on a real train.

901
01:13:52,675 --> 01:13:53,710
Joel, are you there?

902
01:13:53,795 --> 01:13:57,310
I'm still here, Dad. How is Mom?
Is everything all right?

903
01:13:58,275 --> 01:13:59,230
Let's go.

904
01:13:59,315 --> 01:14:00,953
Did I hear others there?

905
01:14:02,275 --> 01:14:03,913
Just a few friends, Dad.

906
01:14:07,635 --> 01:14:09,068
Sounds like a party.

907
01:14:10,115 --> 01:14:11,070
A party?

908
01:14:11,715 --> 01:14:13,546
Come on, let's be alone together.

909
01:14:13,635 --> 01:14:16,593
I don't remember giving
permission for a party, Joel.

910
01:14:18,835 --> 01:14:20,666
Honey, can you hear me?

911
01:14:21,395 --> 01:14:23,625
There's nothing wrong
with having friends over.

912
01:14:23,715 --> 01:14:26,275
Just use your best judgment.
We trust you.

913
01:14:26,995 --> 01:14:29,873
We're coming in on United,
Flight 162 at 3:30.

914
01:14:29,955 --> 01:14:31,149
"Trust."

915
01:14:31,795 --> 01:14:34,355
Seems to me if there were any logic
to our language...

916
01:14:34,435 --> 01:14:36,710
..."trust" would be a four-letter word.

917
01:14:38,595 --> 01:14:41,632
The evening worked out well.
We had a good cash flow.

918
01:14:42,755 --> 01:14:44,825
Rutherford made a few new friends.

919
01:14:45,955 --> 01:14:47,911
He said he'd do his best for me.

920
01:14:55,235 --> 01:14:57,305
Finally, it was time to close shop.

921
01:14:58,595 --> 01:15:00,267
The girls were exhausted.

922
01:15:00,835 --> 01:15:03,554
Lana was hungry.
She wanted to go out for a bite.

923
01:15:04,675 --> 01:15:07,064
She wanted to make love on a real train.

924
01:15:08,115 --> 01:15:09,548
Who was I to say no?

925
01:15:11,555 --> 01:15:14,194
"I can feel it coming in the air tonight

926
01:15:21,475 --> 01:15:24,785
"And I've been waiting for this moment
for all my life

927
01:15:30,915 --> 01:15:32,826
"Can you feel it coming"

928
01:15:33,155 --> 01:15:35,385
I thought no one was going to be here.

929
01:15:37,475 --> 01:15:38,590
Be patient.

930
01:15:49,315 --> 01:15:50,907
"Well, I remember

931
01:15:52,115 --> 01:15:54,026
"I remember - don't worry

932
01:15:56,115 --> 01:15:58,026
"How could I ever forget?

933
01:15:59,235 --> 01:16:00,668
"It's the first time

934
01:16:02,195 --> 01:16:04,151
"The last time we ever met

935
01:16:08,595 --> 01:16:10,392
"But I know the reason

936
01:16:11,395 --> 01:16:13,431
"Why you keep the silence up

937
01:16:15,555 --> 01:16:17,352
"No, you don't fool me

938
01:16:18,755 --> 01:16:20,347
"The hurt doesn't show

939
01:16:21,075 --> 01:16:22,986
"But the pain still grows

940
01:16:23,635 --> 01:16:25,785
"It's no stranger to you or me

941
01:16:29,155 --> 01:16:31,794
"I can feel it coming in the air tonight

942
01:16:38,995 --> 01:16:42,385
"Well, I've been waiting
for this moment for all my life

943
01:16:48,755 --> 01:16:51,064
"I can feel it in the air tonight"

944
01:20:32,435 --> 01:20:33,231
Hi.

945
01:20:33,395 --> 01:20:35,226
They stole the goddamn house, Lana!

946
01:20:35,315 --> 01:20:36,907
I'm not here right now.

947
01:20:36,995 --> 01:20:38,951
But if you'll leave your name and number...

948
01:20:39,035 --> 01:20:41,503
...I'll call you back as soon as possible.

949
01:20:42,275 --> 01:20:43,993
They took everything!

950
01:20:44,155 --> 01:20:45,224
This is unbelievable!

951
01:20:45,315 --> 01:20:48,751
My parents will be home in two hours,
Lana, and they took fucking everything!

952
01:20:48,835 --> 01:20:50,985
I don't know if you know
anything about this...

953
01:20:51,075 --> 01:20:52,747
...but you have to call me right away!

954
01:20:52,835 --> 01:20:54,666
I'm at the house: KL5-2121.

955
01:20:54,915 --> 01:20:56,985
Look, you've really got to help me!

956
01:20:57,795 --> 01:20:59,626
Time of your life, huh, kid?

957
01:21:00,195 --> 01:21:01,389
Where's Lana?

958
01:21:01,475 --> 01:21:02,988
Maybe she's on the choo-choo.

959
01:21:03,075 --> 01:21:05,589
I hear she's got this thing
about choo-choos.

960
01:21:05,875 --> 01:21:07,786
I want to know who took my stuff.

961
01:21:07,875 --> 01:21:10,389
I took your stuff, Joel, are you kidding?

962
01:21:10,995 --> 01:21:12,986
Then you listen to me, buster!

963
01:21:13,075 --> 01:21:14,144
You a-hole!

964
01:21:14,435 --> 01:21:16,346
If I don't get my stuff back...

965
01:21:16,755 --> 01:21:17,585
Shit!

966
01:21:26,995 --> 01:21:28,030
"A-hole?"

967
01:21:28,835 --> 01:21:30,985
I want my furniture back, right now!

968
01:21:31,875 --> 01:21:33,069
Now, you listen to me.

969
01:21:33,155 --> 01:21:35,066
No, no! You listen to me!

970
01:21:36,435 --> 01:21:37,265
Shit!

971
01:21:43,715 --> 01:21:45,353
This is getting boring.

972
01:21:45,475 --> 01:21:47,989
Can I have my furniture back? Please?

973
01:21:49,155 --> 01:21:51,191
You listen to me, you little fuck!

974
01:21:52,515 --> 01:21:54,790
You not only took my two best girls...

975
01:21:55,155 --> 01:21:57,385
...you call me names and insult me!

976
01:21:58,675 --> 01:21:59,630
I'm sorry.

977
01:21:59,715 --> 01:22:01,546
If I had any self-respect...

978
01:22:01,635 --> 01:22:03,785
...it wouldn't just be the furniture...

979
01:22:03,875 --> 01:22:06,708
...it would be your legs! Your arms!
Your head!

980
01:22:09,315 --> 01:22:10,828
Do we understand each other?

981
01:22:10,915 --> 01:22:11,984
Yes, we do.

982
01:22:12,275 --> 01:22:14,550
No! Do we understand each other?

983
01:22:16,435 --> 01:22:18,346
Yes, we understand each other.

984
01:22:20,915 --> 01:22:22,951
Well, you're lucky in one respect.

985
01:22:24,195 --> 01:22:25,310
What's that?

986
01:22:26,755 --> 01:22:28,074
I like you, Joel.

987
01:22:29,955 --> 01:22:31,388
Don't you know that?

988
01:22:40,675 --> 01:22:41,994
What time is it?

989
01:22:42,595 --> 01:22:43,664
It's 4:15.

990
01:22:44,835 --> 01:22:46,029
I'll find a cab.

991
01:22:46,115 --> 01:22:47,946
Something must have happened.

992
01:22:49,475 --> 01:22:50,351
Taxi!

993
01:22:55,995 --> 01:22:57,633
Joel, do you like music?

994
01:22:58,075 --> 01:22:59,906
This is beautiful equipment.

995
01:23:01,035 --> 01:23:02,912
What do you say, $300...

996
01:23:03,715 --> 01:23:05,353
...amps, speakers, the works?

997
01:23:05,435 --> 01:23:06,470
It's a bargain, Joel.

998
01:23:06,555 --> 01:23:09,627
If you go downtown anywhere,
it'd cost you double that.

999
01:23:10,715 --> 01:23:12,751
All right! The kid likes music!

1000
01:23:26,155 --> 01:23:28,350
How about some women's outfits?

1001
01:23:28,635 --> 01:23:30,546
You know, something for your mom?

1002
01:23:30,635 --> 01:23:32,068
Should fit her okay.

1003
01:23:32,315 --> 01:23:33,145
Yes.

1004
01:23:33,435 --> 01:23:34,311
What?

1005
01:23:34,555 --> 01:23:35,749
Yes, I'll buy it!

1006
01:23:35,835 --> 01:23:37,666
I didn't give you a price yet.

1007
01:23:37,755 --> 01:23:39,586
Can we get through this, please?

1008
01:23:39,675 --> 01:23:40,630
$125.

1009
01:23:45,595 --> 01:23:47,267
That's it, you have everything.

1010
01:23:47,355 --> 01:23:48,583
Wait a minute.

1011
01:23:51,995 --> 01:23:53,314
What about this?

1012
01:23:54,395 --> 01:23:55,589
What's that?

1013
01:23:56,155 --> 01:23:58,066
Some glass, artsy-fartsy thing.

1014
01:23:59,035 --> 01:24:01,151
What have you got left, Joel?

1015
01:24:01,275 --> 01:24:02,230
$40.

1016
01:24:03,355 --> 01:24:06,392
I don't think I can go $40
on the artsy-fartsy thing.

1017
01:24:06,955 --> 01:24:09,185
- What do you think, Vic?
- He's only got $40.

1018
01:24:09,275 --> 01:24:10,788
I only have $40.

1019
01:24:12,395 --> 01:24:13,714
We go $340?

1020
01:24:14,555 --> 01:24:16,386
I'll spot you the $300.

1021
01:24:16,715 --> 01:24:18,387
You're good for it, right?

1022
01:24:18,875 --> 01:24:19,910
Certainly.

1023
01:24:19,995 --> 01:24:21,110
I think he is too.

1024
01:24:21,195 --> 01:24:22,071
Here!

1025
01:24:22,155 --> 01:24:23,065
Catch!

1026
01:24:35,115 --> 01:24:36,070
To Joel!

1027
01:24:36,475 --> 01:24:39,990
Here's wishin' you good luck
on your future as a businessman!

1028
01:24:40,315 --> 01:24:43,113
Because, God knows,
you're going to need it!

1029
01:25:22,235 --> 01:25:23,907
Don't, you'll break it!

1030
01:25:23,995 --> 01:25:26,873
That's good. Thank you,
thank you, thank you!

1031
01:25:27,995 --> 01:25:32,227
I'd put all the Chinese things together,
and the Greek on a separate shelf.

1032
01:25:32,475 --> 01:25:35,069
I don't think you should mix centuries.

1033
01:25:50,555 --> 01:25:52,466
Mom! Dad! You're home!

1034
01:25:55,035 --> 01:25:56,309
Where were you?

1035
01:25:56,635 --> 01:25:57,750
I was here.

1036
01:25:57,915 --> 01:25:59,667
We called from the airport!

1037
01:26:00,315 --> 01:26:02,385
I must have been out back watering.

1038
01:26:02,555 --> 01:26:04,705
I thought you were coming
home tomorrow.

1039
01:26:04,795 --> 01:26:06,547
Sweetheart, I said the 5th.

1040
01:26:07,115 --> 01:26:09,265
No, you said the 6th. I wrote it down.

1041
01:26:09,355 --> 01:26:11,232
I'm sure I said the 5th.

1042
01:26:12,395 --> 01:26:13,908
Give me a hand with the luggage.

1043
01:26:13,995 --> 01:26:15,314
She said the 6th.

1044
01:26:19,115 --> 01:26:19,991
Joel?

1045
01:26:20,155 --> 01:26:21,144
Yes, Mom?

1046
01:26:22,555 --> 01:26:24,466
Can I talk to you for a minute?

1047
01:26:29,115 --> 01:26:30,753
What happened to my egg?

1048
01:26:31,115 --> 01:26:32,434
What do you mean?

1049
01:26:33,195 --> 01:26:34,708
There's a crack in it!

1050
01:26:36,715 --> 01:26:37,943
You're kidding!

1051
01:26:38,315 --> 01:26:40,033
No, Joel, I'm not kidding.

1052
01:26:40,315 --> 01:26:42,545
There's a small crack, inside the egg.

1053
01:26:42,875 --> 01:26:43,990
What's wrong?

1054
01:26:44,075 --> 01:26:45,394
My egg is ruined.

1055
01:26:45,995 --> 01:26:47,189
What happened?

1056
01:26:48,635 --> 01:26:49,829
I don't know.

1057
01:26:49,915 --> 01:26:51,143
You don't know.

1058
01:26:52,795 --> 01:26:54,831
Mom, maybe it was there before.

1059
01:26:55,115 --> 01:26:56,753
I don't think so, Joel.

1060
01:26:56,955 --> 01:26:58,832
How could you let this happen?

1061
01:27:01,755 --> 01:27:02,824
I'm sorry.

1062
01:27:02,955 --> 01:27:05,105
This is so damned irresponsible of you!

1063
01:27:05,195 --> 01:27:07,789
We'll get another one. Joel will pay for it.

1064
01:27:08,635 --> 01:27:10,193
Sure, I'll pay for it.

1065
01:27:11,355 --> 01:27:14,870
Where will you get the money
to pay for something like that?

1066
01:27:15,835 --> 01:27:17,951
I'm very disappointed in you.

1067
01:27:25,355 --> 01:27:26,629
She'll be all right.

1068
01:27:26,715 --> 01:27:28,865
Why don't you put in some yard work?

1069
01:28:26,635 --> 01:28:28,910
Do you have something to tell me?

1070
01:28:32,235 --> 01:28:33,270
No...

1071
01:28:34,035 --> 01:28:35,468
...I don't think so.

1072
01:28:36,235 --> 01:28:39,307
I just got off the telephone
with Bill Rutherford.

1073
01:28:42,075 --> 01:28:44,714
Apparently, you two had quite a meeting.

1074
01:28:49,515 --> 01:28:51,745
"Princeton can use a guy like Joel."

1075
01:28:53,755 --> 01:28:54,631
What?

1076
01:28:55,115 --> 01:28:57,504
"Princeton can use a guy like Joel."

1077
01:28:58,955 --> 01:29:00,274
His exact words!

1078
01:29:02,395 --> 01:29:03,874
That's unbelievable!

1079
01:29:03,995 --> 01:29:05,713
You're as good as in!

1080
01:29:06,075 --> 01:29:07,713
I knew you could do it!

1081
01:29:07,835 --> 01:29:10,474
Haven't I been telling you,
sometimes you have to say:

1082
01:29:10,555 --> 01:29:12,864
"What the heck!" Take some chances.

1083
01:29:12,955 --> 01:29:14,308
You were so right.

1084
01:29:14,555 --> 01:29:16,227
You've made me very proud.

1085
01:29:22,075 --> 01:29:23,667
I was just thinking...

1086
01:29:24,875 --> 01:29:27,264
...where we might be ten years from now.

1087
01:29:29,755 --> 01:29:31,552
You know what I think?

1088
01:29:31,715 --> 01:29:33,990
I think we're both going to make it big!

1089
01:29:34,075 --> 01:29:36,305
I'm very optimistic! I mean it!

1090
01:29:40,555 --> 01:29:42,193
Can I ask you something?

1091
01:29:46,875 --> 01:29:48,786
Was our night together...

1092
01:29:51,675 --> 01:29:53,393
...just to set up...

1093
01:29:54,395 --> 01:29:55,794
...Vicki and Guido?

1094
01:30:04,915 --> 01:30:05,870
No.

1095
01:30:07,515 --> 01:30:09,346
You don't believe me, do you?

1096
01:30:11,515 --> 01:30:14,393
My name is Russell Bitterman.
I'm from Wheaton High School.

1097
01:30:14,475 --> 01:30:17,911
Our product is a paper-towel
holder that sells for $8.95.

1098
01:30:19,035 --> 01:30:21,629
We made a profit of $850 last semester.

1099
01:30:28,235 --> 01:30:30,112
I don't want you to get hurt.

1100
01:30:32,315 --> 01:30:36,069
My name is Evonne Williams.
We sell decorative planters for $7.

1101
01:30:37,515 --> 01:30:40,109
We made a profit of $500 last semester.

1102
01:30:43,195 --> 01:30:45,868
Guess we won't see each other for awhile.

1103
01:30:46,395 --> 01:30:47,350
I know.

1104
01:30:49,275 --> 01:30:50,867
Are you going straight home now?

1105
01:30:50,955 --> 01:30:52,354
I don't know. Why?

1106
01:30:52,795 --> 01:30:55,867
It might be nice if we spent
the evening together.

1107
01:30:57,275 --> 01:30:58,833
I'd really like that.

1108
01:31:00,155 --> 01:31:02,032
How much have you got on you?

1109
01:31:03,675 --> 01:31:05,154
How much have I got on me?

1110
01:31:05,235 --> 01:31:06,384
I've got $20.

1111
01:31:07,035 --> 01:31:08,150
$20, Lana?

1112
01:31:09,195 --> 01:31:11,265
What are we going to do about this?

1113
01:31:11,355 --> 01:31:14,074
- Can I send it to you?
- Can you send it to me?

1114
01:31:14,915 --> 01:31:16,746
'Cause I don't have that much here.

1115
01:31:16,835 --> 01:31:18,314
How about I write you a check?

1116
01:31:18,395 --> 01:31:21,705
Do you think I'd accept a check from you?
What am I, stupid?

1117
01:31:22,875 --> 01:31:24,547
I have a bond at the bank.

1118
01:31:26,075 --> 01:31:27,667
My name is Joel Goodson.

1119
01:31:28,635 --> 01:31:30,466
I deal in human fulfillment.

1120
01:31:31,515 --> 01:31:33,904
I grossed over $8,000 in one night.

1121
01:31:35,675 --> 01:31:37,666
The time of your life, huh, kid?
