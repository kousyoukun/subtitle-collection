1
00:01:58,050 --> 00:02:00,382
The dream is always the same.

2
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:04,553
Instead of going home,
I go to the neighbors'.

3
00:02:14,233 --> 00:02:15,723
I ring, but nobody answers.

4
00:02:17,303 --> 00:02:19,498
The door is open, so I go inside.

5
00:02:22,808 --> 00:02:25,504
I look around,
but no one seems to be there.

6
00:02:34,654 --> 00:02:36,417
And then, I hear the shower running.

7
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:40,319
So, I go upstairs to see what's what.

8
00:03:01,447 --> 00:03:02,436
Then I see her.

9
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:05,977
This...girl!

10
00:03:06,052 --> 00:03:07,679
This incredible girl!

11
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:12,783
I don't know why she's there
because she doesn't live there.

12
00:03:13,859 --> 00:03:15,622
But this is a dream, so I go with it.

13
00:03:18,064 --> 00:03:19,224
"Who's there?" she says.

14
00:03:20,633 --> 00:03:21,622
"Joel," I say.

15
00:03:22,802 --> 00:03:23,826
"What are you doing here?"

16
00:03:24,637 --> 00:03:25,968
" I don't know."

17
00:03:26,839 --> 00:03:28,170
"What are you doing here?"

18
00:03:29,642 --> 00:03:31,371
" I'm taking a shower," she says.

19
00:03:32,878 --> 00:03:35,005
Then I give her...

20
00:03:35,081 --> 00:03:36,139
..."Do you want me to go?"

21
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:39,515
"No," she says.

22
00:03:39,585 --> 00:03:41,143
"l want you to wash my back."

23
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:46,822
I'm becoming enthusiastic
about this dream.

24
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:52,990
So, I go toward her, but she's hard
to find through all the steam.

25
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:55,625
I keep losing her.

26
00:04:07,113 --> 00:04:08,410
Finally I get to the door...

27
00:04:13,252 --> 00:04:17,916
...and I find myself in a room full
of kids taking their College Boards.

28
00:04:19,625 --> 00:04:20,922
I'm more than three hours late!

29
00:04:21,861 --> 00:04:24,853
I have only two minutes
to complete the entire test.

30
00:04:28,701 --> 00:04:30,862
I've made a terrible mistake.

31
00:04:32,204 --> 00:04:34,399
I'll never get to college.

32
00:04:34,473 --> 00:04:35,872
My life is ruined.

33
00:04:39,945 --> 00:04:44,644
Here's the game; five-card draw
with a spit. Anaconda, high-low.

34
00:04:52,892 --> 00:04:53,722
What happened?

35
00:04:56,295 --> 00:04:57,159
Last night?

36
00:04:57,797 --> 00:04:59,287
That's right, with Kessler.

37
00:05:01,667 --> 00:05:03,225
She was baby-sitting down the street.

38
00:05:03,569 --> 00:05:04,558
We know that!

39
00:05:05,304 --> 00:05:06,293
So, I went over there.

40
00:05:08,974 --> 00:05:11,966
She was bathing the baby and
accidentally hit the shower knob.

41
00:05:12,411 --> 00:05:14,402
All of her clothes
were upstairs, drying.

42
00:05:18,584 --> 00:05:21,246
So she plops down...

43
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:24,414
...she looks up at me and says...

44
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:27,759
..."l think I'm in the mood."

45
00:05:28,627 --> 00:05:29,616
She said that?

46
00:05:31,764 --> 00:05:32,753
What did you say?!

47
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,261
I didn't have to say anything.

48
00:05:36,602 --> 00:05:37,933
What did you do?

49
00:05:39,338 --> 00:05:40,703
What do you think I did?

50
00:05:41,607 --> 00:05:44,940
I think you got the hell out of there,
ran home and whacked off!

51
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:51,339
I disagree.

52
00:05:51,417 --> 00:05:52,714
Did you have your bike with you?

53
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:58,521
I think you jumped on your bike,
pedaled home and whacked off!

54
00:06:01,627 --> 00:06:03,618
That's what you think, right?

55
00:06:04,029 --> 00:06:08,728
With Kessler sitting on the floor
like that, wanting me?

56
00:06:14,139 --> 00:06:15,128
No guts, Goodson.

57
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:18,537
I know, but the problem was,
I wasn't attracted to her.

58
00:06:18,811 --> 00:06:20,108
Should never stop you.

59
00:06:20,246 --> 00:06:21,372
She seemed too big.

60
00:06:21,747 --> 00:06:23,044
It could have worked out.

61
00:06:23,983 --> 00:06:25,541
I thought I'd get into trouble.

62
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:29,548
Sometimes you have to say,
"What the fuck! " Make your move!

63
00:06:31,824 --> 00:06:33,155
That's easy for you to say.

64
00:06:35,261 --> 00:06:37,889
You're all set.
You're probably going to Harvard.

65
00:06:39,265 --> 00:06:42,996
Me, I don't want to make a mistake,
jeopardize my future!

66
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:46,501
Joel, let me tell you something.

67
00:06:50,175 --> 00:06:53,076
Every now and then, say,
"What the fuck."

68
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:57,173
"What the fuck," gives you freedom.

69
00:06:58,417 --> 00:07:00,408
Freedom brings opportunity.

70
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:04,920
Opportunity makes your future.

71
00:07:07,459 --> 00:07:09,222
Be right there.

72
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:16,863
So, your folks are going out of town?

73
00:07:19,438 --> 00:07:20,097
Tomorrow.

74
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:24,603
You'll have the house all to yourself?

75
00:07:27,046 --> 00:07:27,705
Yeah.

76
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:29,937
"What the fuck."

77
00:07:36,388 --> 00:07:38,447
If you can't say it...

78
00:07:38,524 --> 00:07:39,388
...you can't do it.

79
00:07:50,235 --> 00:07:52,635
Joel, did you receive
your SAT results?

80
00:07:55,841 --> 00:07:57,138
How did you do?

81
00:07:57,977 --> 00:08:00,810
597 Math, 560 Verbal.

82
00:08:02,414 --> 00:08:04,746
If you wanted,
you could take the tests again?

83
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:06,178
-I guess so.
-Great.

84
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:08,643
Joel, I want to show you something.

85
00:08:09,588 --> 00:08:10,987
Honey, did you pack my Mace?

86
00:08:11,156 --> 00:08:12,987
Yes, in your cosmetic case.

87
00:08:18,364 --> 00:08:20,855
Joel, do you hear something odd?

88
00:08:20,933 --> 00:08:21,991
Something unpleasant?

89
00:08:22,601 --> 00:08:23,260
No.

90
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:26,668
A preponderance of bass, perhaps?

91
00:08:28,374 --> 00:08:29,033
No.

92
00:08:29,675 --> 00:08:31,370
Is this the way I left the equalizer?

93
00:08:32,111 --> 00:08:32,770
No.

94
00:08:33,379 --> 00:08:37,008
This is not a toy for you
and your friends.

95
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:42,677
If you can't use it properly,
you're not to use it at all.

96
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:47,452
My house, my rules.

97
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:54,393
Joel, I spoke to Bill Rutherford.

98
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,895
He interviews for Princeton.

99
00:08:57,136 --> 00:08:58,467
I'll never get into Princeton!

100
00:08:58,804 --> 00:09:00,465
I already arranged an interview.

101
00:09:00,806 --> 00:09:03,138
Friday night, the 4th, at our house.

102
00:09:03,475 --> 00:09:04,806
Oh, Jesus, Dad!

103
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:08,976
Tell him about your involvement with
Future Enterprisers.

104
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:10,538
They like that.

105
00:09:13,218 --> 00:09:15,413
There's $50 for food,
which is more than you'll need.

106
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:18,713
An extra $50 for emergencies
and $25, just in case.

107
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:22,050
Don't forget to water
the plants on the patio.

108
00:09:22,428 --> 00:09:24,419
I made a list,
it's on the refrigerator door.

109
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:26,061
Dad, should I start your car?

110
00:09:26,432 --> 00:09:27,421
The car will be fine, Joel.

111
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:28,665
For the battery, I mean--

112
00:09:29,001 --> 00:09:31,834
Please, you are not to use my car.
You're not insured to drive it.

113
00:09:31,937 --> 00:09:33,461
-Use the station wagon.
-Use my car, honey.

114
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:37,398
Do we understand each other?

115
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:38,840
Okay!

116
00:09:40,579 --> 00:09:44,015
And concerning the house, darling, just
use your best judgment.

117
00:09:44,183 --> 00:09:45,582
We trust you.

118
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:46,740
Have a good time.

119
00:09:47,953 --> 00:09:48,749
Be good.

120
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:50,453
We will, honey. Bye.

121
00:10:44,643 --> 00:10:48,010
"Just take those old records
off the shelf

122
00:10:48,514 --> 00:10:51,506
" I sit and listen to them by myself

123
00:10:52,518 --> 00:10:55,510
"Today's music ain't got the same soul

124
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:59,147
"l like that old time rock and roll!

125
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:02,821
" Don't try to take me to a disco

126
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:06,821
"You'll never even get me
out on the floor

127
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:10,597
" In ten minutes I'll
be late for the door

128
00:11:11,436 --> 00:11:14,769
" I like that old time rock and roll!

129
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:18,341
"Still like that old time rock and roll!

130
00:11:19,611 --> 00:11:22,273
"That kind of music
just soothes the soul

131
00:11:23,282 --> 00:11:26,615
"l reminisce about the days of old

132
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:30,178
"And that old time rock and roll!"

133
00:11:53,111 --> 00:11:54,100
Guess what?

134
00:11:54,346 --> 00:11:56,041
Dalby got into Harvard.

135
00:11:57,482 --> 00:11:58,881
He must have aced his boards.

136
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:00,310
780, Verbal.

137
00:12:00,819 --> 00:12:02,150
765, Math!

138
00:12:02,487 --> 00:12:03,146
Shit!

139
00:12:03,488 --> 00:12:06,082
Do you know how much money
a Harvard MBA earns, first year?

140
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:07,089
$40,000.

141
00:12:07,392 --> 00:12:11,089
I have a cousin who is a dermatologist.
First year, over $60,000!

142
00:12:11,396 --> 00:12:12,727
Just for squeezing zits?

143
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:16,891
Why don't you try it, Barry?
You have the experience.

144
00:12:18,503 --> 00:12:19,902
Thank you, you're very kind.

145
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:21,331
Hey, listen, you guys.

146
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:24,402
Doesn't anyone want
to accomplish anything?

147
00:12:24,743 --> 00:12:26,108
Or do we just want to make money?

148
00:12:27,679 --> 00:12:28,611
Make money.

149
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:30,237
Just make money.

150
00:12:31,116 --> 00:12:32,413
Make a lot of money.

151
00:12:33,018 --> 00:12:34,007
What about you, Joel?

152
00:12:36,855 --> 00:12:38,846
Serve my fellow mankind.

153
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:46,629
Profit motive.

154
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:50,031
Competition.

155
00:12:51,536 --> 00:12:52,867
Free enterprise.

156
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:56,635
Is there any company that doesn't
have a product in production?

157
00:12:57,276 --> 00:12:58,709
We're falling far behind.

158
00:12:58,944 --> 00:13:00,138
You haven't exactly been helping.

159
00:13:00,445 --> 00:13:01,912
You wanted to be
the production executive.

160
00:13:02,047 --> 00:13:05,642
Bullshit! Every sales manager I know
helps with the production.

161
00:13:05,817 --> 00:13:06,545
Really? Who?

162
00:13:06,952 --> 00:13:08,442
Just help me with the production!

163
00:13:08,787 --> 00:13:10,948
No! I'm too busy with
marketing and sales!

164
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:12,951
How can you be busy with
marketing and sales?

165
00:13:13,158 --> 00:13:14,455
I haven't given you a product yet.

166
00:13:15,727 --> 00:13:17,888
Barry, just bring the goddamn thing
over tonight.

167
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:21,222
I only took this class because
I thought it'd look good on my record.

168
00:13:28,073 --> 00:13:28,971
Hey, Glenn. What's up?

169
00:13:29,908 --> 00:13:31,569
I heard your parents were away.

170
00:13:33,912 --> 00:13:35,402
I thought I could borrow a room?

171
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:39,979
Barry is here, and we're working.

172
00:13:40,419 --> 00:13:42,080
Oh, we won't bother you.

173
00:13:42,421 --> 00:13:43,410
We don't have anywhere to go.

174
00:13:44,256 --> 00:13:45,245
You know how it is.

175
00:13:47,592 --> 00:13:48,923
Okay. Use my bedroom.

176
00:13:50,696 --> 00:13:51,663
Thanks, Joel.

177
00:13:59,271 --> 00:14:00,533
The "Memo-Minder! "

178
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:02,636
Here's how it works.

179
00:14:02,874 --> 00:14:07,208
A call comes in for your Mom which is
fairly important. What do you do?

180
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:11,943
You write the message on the paper and
flip this switch, activating the light.

181
00:14:12,851 --> 00:14:16,844
Now, a call for your Dad comes in,
and it is extremely important!

182
00:14:17,222 --> 00:14:19,281
You're gonna get your ass kicked in
if he misses it.

183
00:14:19,858 --> 00:14:21,120
So, what do you do?

184
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:22,785
Write the message down there,
position two.

185
00:14:27,232 --> 00:14:30,793
We invest $1.86 in materials, sell it
for $9.95 and we'll make a fortune!

186
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:39,237
I can't concentrate with this.

187
00:14:39,544 --> 00:14:40,738
This is really annoying.

188
00:14:42,881 --> 00:14:43,745
That is ridiculous!

189
00:14:47,652 --> 00:14:48,641
I'm leaving.

190
00:14:56,762 --> 00:14:59,060
Lock the door when you leave, Glenn.

191
00:15:02,768 --> 00:15:04,565
If you read me, grunt twice!

192
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:10,098
Thank you!

193
00:15:46,711 --> 00:15:49,111
I can't believe Glenn bringing
Statwiler over like that.

194
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:50,107
Why?

195
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:53,111
Because he boffed Hendricks last week!

196
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:54,384
He did?

197
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:57,115
Yes! And after the game on Saturday,
he fucked her.

198
00:15:58,557 --> 00:16:00,047
-Barry?
-What?

199
00:16:00,325 --> 00:16:02,316
Boffing and fucking are the same thing.

200
00:16:03,728 --> 00:16:04,717
They are?

201
00:16:06,832 --> 00:16:08,823
Yes. What did you think?

202
00:16:09,134 --> 00:16:10,465
I thought it was something else.

203
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:12,835
You're sure on this?

204
00:16:14,339 --> 00:16:15,328
I'm positive.

205
00:16:19,044 --> 00:16:20,033
Shit!

206
00:16:30,856 --> 00:16:32,153
Sublime breasts.

207
00:16:32,858 --> 00:16:33,847
They're what kind of breasts?

208
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:35,490
Sublime! They're sublime!

209
00:16:39,764 --> 00:16:42,426
A couple of boys driving
around in daddy's car.

210
00:16:42,767 --> 00:16:44,098
Do you want to race?

211
00:16:50,775 --> 00:16:51,639
Hit it.

212
00:17:13,899 --> 00:17:15,764
Okay. Good.

213
00:17:15,901 --> 00:17:19,860
You've done the old man's car bit.
That's a good start.

214
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:24,402
Now, try this on for size.

215
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:27,405
"The Leather Castle."

216
00:17:28,813 --> 00:17:31,714
"Chicago's finest
dominants and submissives."

217
00:17:32,717 --> 00:17:36,483
" Fully equipped dungeons.
Beginners welcome."

218
00:17:37,722 --> 00:17:38,711
It sounds great, Miles.

219
00:17:39,491 --> 00:17:40,822
Listen to this!

220
00:17:41,826 --> 00:17:45,318
"My daddy spanked my bare bottom.

221
00:17:46,064 --> 00:17:49,329
"Now he's gone.
Will you take his place?

222
00:17:49,668 --> 00:17:50,657
"Call Misty."

223
00:17:51,169 --> 00:17:54,502
Really, Joel.
You have to respond to this one.

224
00:17:54,739 --> 00:17:55,728
They come to your house!

225
00:17:56,441 --> 00:18:00,935
"Countess Angelique seeks
young submissive with large ankles!"

226
00:18:01,446 --> 00:18:02,435
This is it!

227
00:18:02,747 --> 00:18:06,945
"For a good time in the privacy
of your own home, call Jackie.

228
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:09,243
"555-4875."

229
00:18:10,522 --> 00:18:13,457
Succinct, to the point,
down to business. What do you say?

230
00:18:17,862 --> 00:18:19,955
Listen, if you want to,
call for yourself.

231
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:23,757
A good time, Joel!

232
00:18:24,703 --> 00:18:26,967
In the privacy of your own home!

233
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:29,267
What more could you ask for?

234
00:18:30,775 --> 00:18:32,970
I'll make my own calls, thank you.

235
00:18:33,745 --> 00:18:35,645
Then...

236
00:18:35,714 --> 00:18:36,408
...call!

237
00:18:37,048 --> 00:18:38,037
Forget it!

238
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:42,715
Forget it!

239
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:45,085
All right!

240
00:18:45,156 --> 00:18:46,214
I'm calling.

241
00:18:47,993 --> 00:18:48,982
You're calling?

242
00:18:50,295 --> 00:18:51,626
Someday you'll thank me for this.

243
00:18:52,063 --> 00:18:53,394
Don't mention me, Miles.

244
00:18:54,132 --> 00:18:56,123
Oh, it's her answering machine.

245
00:18:58,069 --> 00:19:01,061
Hi, Jackie, this is Joel Goodson,
345 Remson, Glencoe.

246
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:04,402
I'd like to have a good time
in my home tonight. Bye!

247
00:19:10,515 --> 00:19:11,743
That was very cute.

248
00:19:13,151 --> 00:19:15,051
Now, give me the number
so I can call her back.

249
00:19:15,253 --> 00:19:17,517
Number? There isn't any number.

250
00:19:18,823 --> 00:19:20,518
Give me the number, damn it!

251
00:19:24,029 --> 00:19:25,018
There is no number.

252
00:19:27,165 --> 00:19:28,530
You're an asshole!

253
00:19:29,167 --> 00:19:31,294
Gotta go.
Catch you later.

254
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:37,138
Shithead!

255
00:20:44,976 --> 00:20:46,136
Oh God!

256
00:21:03,061 --> 00:21:06,224
Hello, Joel, I'm Jackie. How are you?

257
00:21:08,833 --> 00:21:10,994
Nice to meet you, Jackie.
I'm not Joel.

258
00:21:11,336 --> 00:21:13,361
Joel stepped out for a moment.

259
00:21:14,939 --> 00:21:15,837
I'll go call him.

260
00:21:24,082 --> 00:21:24,980
Holy shit!

261
00:21:29,087 --> 00:21:31,419
Dalby, get your ass over here!

262
00:21:31,756 --> 00:21:33,348
I'm playing cards, Joel!

263
00:21:33,691 --> 00:21:34,680
Just get over here!

264
00:21:35,193 --> 00:21:36,182
Is she there?

265
00:21:36,528 --> 00:21:39,190
Yes, she is here,
and she is waiting for you!

266
00:21:39,597 --> 00:21:42,430
She's not waiting for me,
she's waiting for you.

267
00:21:43,101 --> 00:21:44,090
Are you coming?

268
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:46,931
No! I'm playing cards!

269
00:21:48,773 --> 00:21:49,762
You're not coming?

270
00:21:52,877 --> 00:21:53,935
Get over here, Dalby!

271
00:22:08,293 --> 00:22:10,727
Look, I'm very sorry
about the misunderstanding.

272
00:22:12,897 --> 00:22:15,229
Be a courageous person, Joel.
Open the door!

273
00:22:15,567 --> 00:22:17,899
Then, you see, I can call a cab.

274
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:20,562
Again, I'm very sorry.

275
00:22:21,139 --> 00:22:24,472
If we can agree on an arrangement,
I'm in no mood for complaints.

276
00:22:25,076 --> 00:22:27,772
I mean, when you put
your good money down...

277
00:22:27,846 --> 00:22:31,077
...you gotta get what you went after in
the first place. Know what I'm saying?

278
00:22:31,149 --> 00:22:34,312
When you buy a TV,
you don't buy Sony if you want RCA.

279
00:22:35,587 --> 00:22:37,987
I know you and I could get along
real well. But, hey!

280
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:40,151
It's your hard-earned money,
am I right?

281
00:22:41,659 --> 00:22:45,095
Now, we make an arrangement,
and everyone is satisfied.

282
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:46,488
You paid carfare.

283
00:22:46,831 --> 00:22:49,823
A long drive.
I don't ever come out this far.

284
00:22:51,002 --> 00:22:51,832
And your time.

285
00:22:52,170 --> 00:22:55,162
My time, my effort,
my infinite patience and understanding.

286
00:22:55,507 --> 00:22:56,269
Thank you.

287
00:22:56,608 --> 00:22:57,597
$75.

288
00:22:59,611 --> 00:23:00,339
Fair enough.

289
00:23:00,678 --> 00:23:03,112
Joel, I'm going to give you
a telephone number.

290
00:23:03,948 --> 00:23:06,416
Ask for Lana when you call.

291
00:23:06,484 --> 00:23:07,348
She is what you want.

292
00:23:10,688 --> 00:23:12,781
She's what every white boy
off the lake wants.

293
00:23:45,223 --> 00:23:47,885
All right, Goodson,
we know you're in there!

294
00:23:48,493 --> 00:23:49,482
What's that?!

295
00:23:50,828 --> 00:23:51,817
I think someone's out there.

296
00:23:59,504 --> 00:24:03,565
Joel, the house is surrounded.
Do exactly as we say,

297
00:24:03,741 --> 00:24:05,174
and no one will get hurt.

298
00:24:06,277 --> 00:24:07,266
Oh, shit!

299
00:24:07,345 --> 00:24:12,009
Get off the baby-sitter! Put on your
pants, and come out with your hands up!

300
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:21,090
Please, Joel, do as they say!

301
00:24:22,827 --> 00:24:23,851
Get off the baby-sitter!

302
00:24:24,596 --> 00:24:26,029
Don't throw your life away like this.

303
00:24:29,267 --> 00:24:33,931
Listen, you goddamn punk, you'll never
have a future! Not if I can help it!

304
00:24:34,939 --> 00:24:36,930
Did you hear me?! No future!

305
00:24:37,775 --> 00:24:39,106
Who is that?

306
00:24:39,544 --> 00:24:40,602
My father!

307
00:25:37,669 --> 00:25:39,933
Hello? Lana?

308
00:25:40,505 --> 00:25:41,164
Yes?

309
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:43,599
Hi.

310
00:25:57,055 --> 00:25:59,546
I'm a nice guy,
and I would like to meet you tonight.

311
00:25:59,624 --> 00:26:01,114
Fine. Where are you?

312
00:26:04,295 --> 00:26:05,125
Where do you live?

313
00:26:09,801 --> 00:26:10,460
Glencoe.

314
00:26:11,869 --> 00:26:13,200
What is your name?

315
00:26:18,976 --> 00:26:19,635
Ralph.

316
00:26:21,045 --> 00:26:23,707
Ralph, can I have the address?

317
00:26:31,389 --> 00:26:32,048
345...

318
00:26:32,957 --> 00:26:33,651
...Remson.

319
00:26:35,393 --> 00:26:36,155
Ralph?

320
00:26:39,330 --> 00:26:40,319
I'll see you tonight.

321
00:28:21,499 --> 00:28:23,490
Are you ready for me, Ralph?

322
00:30:22,553 --> 00:30:25,886
This is a beautiful place, Ralph.
Is it all yours?

323
00:30:26,557 --> 00:30:27,888
It's my folks' house.

324
00:30:29,226 --> 00:30:31,217
Do you know what it's worth?

325
00:30:33,464 --> 00:30:34,453
A lot, probably.

326
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:36,460
Oh, yeah! Real estate?

327
00:30:36,801 --> 00:30:37,790
It's fabulous!

328
00:30:38,903 --> 00:30:42,236
Listen, Lana...my name
really isn't Ralph.

329
00:30:45,643 --> 00:30:47,304
It's Joel.

330
00:30:48,312 --> 00:30:50,576
I need $300...Joel.

331
00:30:53,250 --> 00:30:54,148
You're kidding?

332
00:30:54,485 --> 00:30:55,816
No, I don't believe I am.

333
00:30:56,153 --> 00:30:57,484
Could I send it to you?

334
00:31:00,825 --> 00:31:02,486
Could you send it to me, Joel?

335
00:31:03,327 --> 00:31:06,819
I just don't have that much money
here in the house.

336
00:31:07,164 --> 00:31:08,324
How much money do you have?

337
00:31:09,934 --> 00:31:12,596
-I have $50.
-$50?

338
00:31:12,903 --> 00:31:15,064
What are we going to do about this?

339
00:31:21,278 --> 00:31:22,939
I have a bond at the bank
that I could cash--

340
00:31:23,014 --> 00:31:24,675
I'm not good at waiting for people.

341
00:31:26,617 --> 00:31:27,606
I'll be quick.

342
00:31:28,352 --> 00:31:29,683
Give it a try.

343
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:10,549
I'm back!

344
00:32:23,941 --> 00:32:24,930
I'm here for you.

345
00:32:46,030 --> 00:32:48,191
How could she? It's so stupid!

346
00:32:48,532 --> 00:32:49,692
Tell your mother it broke!

347
00:32:50,034 --> 00:32:53,367
That egg is worth a lot more than $300!

348
00:32:53,704 --> 00:32:54,693
What are you going to do?

349
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:58,338
I'm gonna get it back,
is what I'm gonna do.

350
00:32:58,409 --> 00:32:59,205
Are you going to help?

351
00:32:59,243 --> 00:33:00,232
Sure. When?

352
00:33:02,213 --> 00:33:03,202
Right now!

353
00:33:03,547 --> 00:33:06,209
Not right now!
I have a trig mid-term tomorrow!

354
00:33:07,451 --> 00:33:08,418
Hey, Mr. What-the-fuck...

355
00:33:08,919 --> 00:33:11,319
...I mean, what about exploring
the dark side and all that?

356
00:33:11,422 --> 00:33:13,049
Or was that just bullshit?

357
00:33:13,724 --> 00:33:16,022
That was bullshit, Joel.

358
00:33:16,093 --> 00:33:18,391
I'm surprised you listened to me.

359
00:33:25,469 --> 00:33:26,299
Are you coming?

360
00:33:35,579 --> 00:33:37,570
How can you be certain she'll be here?

361
00:33:38,315 --> 00:33:41,910
I called Jackie and she said
to look for Lana here.

362
00:33:43,587 --> 00:33:47,819
Great idea. Where else can
you buy a hot chocolate for $4?

363
00:33:49,593 --> 00:33:50,423
She's here!

364
00:33:54,431 --> 00:33:57,764
The girl in the blue dress
with the beautiful legs.

365
00:33:58,502 --> 00:33:59,332
That's her.

366
00:33:59,770 --> 00:34:01,761
She is fantastic looking!

367
00:34:11,348 --> 00:34:12,679
She's looking right at us!

368
00:34:22,026 --> 00:34:23,459
She knows we're here.

369
00:34:33,804 --> 00:34:36,034
That's it?

370
00:34:36,106 --> 00:34:36,970
That's it, Joel?!

371
00:34:40,644 --> 00:34:43,044
I can't believe we came
all the way here for that!

372
00:34:45,716 --> 00:34:47,377
At least she knows
we're on to her, Miles.

373
00:34:47,718 --> 00:34:49,379
Oh, yeah, she must be terrified.

374
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:51,549
Joel!

375
00:34:54,725 --> 00:34:55,714
Is this your car?

376
00:34:57,061 --> 00:34:57,823
Maybe.

377
00:34:59,997 --> 00:35:00,986
Can we talk a minute?

378
00:35:02,166 --> 00:35:04,066
Okay.

379
00:35:04,134 --> 00:35:05,158
Let's talk!

380
00:35:05,669 --> 00:35:08,001
Okay. In the car, all right?
It's freezing.

381
00:35:20,084 --> 00:35:21,073
Will you do me a favor?

382
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:24,581
You want me to do you a favor?

383
00:35:24,922 --> 00:35:25,911
I just need a lift.

384
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:27,587
Look, I want my egg back!

385
00:35:31,028 --> 00:35:31,926
Get out of the car!

386
00:35:32,296 --> 00:35:33,285
Joel, better get moving.

387
00:35:33,697 --> 00:35:34,789
I want my egg back!

388
00:35:35,199 --> 00:35:37,030
You got it, all right?
Let's just get driving!

389
00:35:37,134 --> 00:35:37,998
When?

390
00:35:38,535 --> 00:35:39,194
Now!

391
00:35:39,536 --> 00:35:40,525
Open the door!

392
00:35:40,804 --> 00:35:41,702
When do I get it back?

393
00:35:42,039 --> 00:35:43,028
Start driving!

394
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:45,103
Open the door!
Are you going to open the door?!

395
00:35:46,043 --> 00:35:47,032
Hey, buster!

396
00:35:47,678 --> 00:35:48,337
Oh fuck! Will you just--

397
00:35:48,612 --> 00:35:50,546
-Get off the car!
-Just start driving!

398
00:35:50,714 --> 00:35:52,045
Start driving, now!

399
00:35:53,717 --> 00:35:55,548
Why don't you start the car, Joel?

400
00:35:56,887 --> 00:35:58,047
Fuck! Get out of here!

401
00:35:58,389 --> 00:36:00,380
Start the goddamn car, Joel!

402
00:36:00,724 --> 00:36:01,713
Lana, open the door.

403
00:36:04,395 --> 00:36:06,056
Where are you going? Lana!

404
00:36:06,397 --> 00:36:07,728
Get out, or I'll kill you!

405
00:36:19,576 --> 00:36:20,474
Who was that guy?

406
00:36:21,245 --> 00:36:23,145
My manager.

407
00:36:23,213 --> 00:36:24,908
He acts a little crazy sometimes.

408
00:36:26,850 --> 00:36:28,147
This is my friend, Miles.

409
00:36:30,921 --> 00:36:32,252
Do you like excitement, Miles?

410
00:36:33,257 --> 00:36:34,246
Love it.

411
00:36:52,009 --> 00:36:54,000
Okay, where do you want to go?

412
00:36:54,778 --> 00:36:58,111
I don't know, Joel.
I haven't given it a lot of thought.

413
00:36:58,182 --> 00:36:59,206
Tell me this:

414
00:36:59,616 --> 00:37:01,174
Am I going in the right direction?

415
00:37:03,787 --> 00:37:05,516
Oh, shit! Here he comes!

416
00:37:05,889 --> 00:37:06,617
Here who comes?

417
00:37:07,791 --> 00:37:08,780
That manager of yours?

418
00:37:13,464 --> 00:37:14,294
Hey, Guido!

419
00:37:15,032 --> 00:37:17,557
Big man, hey, Guido!

420
00:37:17,634 --> 00:37:18,896
Big man with a gun!

421
00:37:19,303 --> 00:37:20,292
What are you going to do?

422
00:37:20,637 --> 00:37:21,535
Shoot us all? Stupid!

423
00:37:26,810 --> 00:37:28,903
This guy Guido...

424
00:37:28,979 --> 00:37:30,640
-...he's a "manager"?
-That's right.

425
00:37:32,015 --> 00:37:33,004
Or a pimp?

426
00:37:33,317 --> 00:37:34,306
Now, that was quick, Joel.

427
00:37:34,485 --> 00:37:37,977
Have you always been this quick,
or is this something new?

428
00:37:38,322 --> 00:37:39,220
I don't believe this!

429
00:37:39,990 --> 00:37:41,651
I have a trig. mid-term tomorrow...

430
00:37:41,725 --> 00:37:44,091
...and I'm being chased by Guido,
the killer-pimp!

431
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:10,679
Miles?

432
00:38:12,523 --> 00:38:13,512
I think I can take him.

433
00:38:13,657 --> 00:38:14,646
What are you talking...?

434
00:38:45,622 --> 00:38:47,283
I'm really not enjoying this.

435
00:39:07,744 --> 00:39:08,642
I think I'm going to throw up.

436
00:39:19,156 --> 00:39:21,147
I think I'm going to throw up
on you, Joel!

437
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:45,270
Porsche...

438
00:39:45,349 --> 00:39:46,839
...there is no substitute.

439
00:39:50,053 --> 00:39:51,179
Fuck you.

440
00:39:55,759 --> 00:39:57,693
Hi, dear. It's mother.

441
00:39:57,761 --> 00:39:59,092
How are you?

442
00:39:59,129 --> 00:40:01,620
Just checking in, to say hello.
See how you're doing...

443
00:40:01,698 --> 00:40:03,290
...and give you our flight information.

444
00:40:04,368 --> 00:40:07,303
Wait a minute.
I want to write it down.

445
00:40:09,973 --> 00:40:14,205
Saturday, United Airlines,
Flight 162, arriving at 3:30.

446
00:40:14,711 --> 00:40:18,203
That is correct. Is everything fine
with you? Do you have enough money?

447
00:40:19,650 --> 00:40:22,642
It never seems to go as far
as you think it will.

448
00:40:24,588 --> 00:40:26,488
Yes, I know.

449
00:40:26,557 --> 00:40:27,922
I'm learning, Mom.

450
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:31,220
How is Aunt Tudi?

451
00:40:36,099 --> 00:40:37,498
I will.

452
00:40:38,569 --> 00:40:40,002
See you then, bye.

453
00:40:42,506 --> 00:40:43,837
Your folks, huh?

454
00:40:45,175 --> 00:40:46,665
So, how are they?

455
00:40:47,010 --> 00:40:48,341
Oh, they're just fine.

456
00:40:48,845 --> 00:40:50,176
And how is Aunt Tudi?

457
00:40:50,514 --> 00:40:53,005
Her hip is much better.
She sends me her love.

458
00:40:58,755 --> 00:41:00,416
You were telling me about Guido.

459
00:41:01,158 --> 00:41:03,456
I quit Guido.

460
00:41:05,028 --> 00:41:05,687
How come?

461
00:41:10,934 --> 00:41:11,923
Guido thought he owned me.

462
00:41:14,204 --> 00:41:15,136
Nobody owns me.

463
00:41:19,443 --> 00:41:22,776
The problem is, I owe him money
for clothes and hospital bills.

464
00:41:23,146 --> 00:41:24,773
You were in the hospital?

465
00:41:26,383 --> 00:41:28,715
I had this...

466
00:41:28,785 --> 00:41:30,047
...pain in my chest.

467
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:31,212
I thought I had a heart condition.

468
00:41:32,956 --> 00:41:33,945
What was it?

469
00:41:35,726 --> 00:41:36,715
The doctor said nerves.

470
00:41:37,894 --> 00:41:40,226
Nice service.

471
00:41:40,297 --> 00:41:40,956
Reed & Barton.

472
00:41:44,468 --> 00:41:46,959
Thank you for breakfast. It was good.

473
00:41:49,306 --> 00:41:50,398
I'm going to school now.

474
00:41:56,580 --> 00:41:58,514
I have to ask you to leave.

475
00:42:02,252 --> 00:42:02,911
I'm sorry.

476
00:42:04,488 --> 00:42:05,477
You won't let me stay?

477
00:42:07,324 --> 00:42:09,315
No, I have to go to school.

478
00:42:13,830 --> 00:42:15,593
I really am sorry.

479
00:42:19,836 --> 00:42:20,825
No, I'm sorry.

480
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:27,699
I'll be right back.

481
00:42:31,615 --> 00:42:33,207
You guys go ahead without me.

482
00:42:34,217 --> 00:42:35,206
She is still here?

483
00:42:35,619 --> 00:42:36,608
She won't leave.

484
00:42:40,624 --> 00:42:41,613
She won't leave.

485
00:42:47,464 --> 00:42:49,955
Lana, look...

486
00:42:50,033 --> 00:42:52,126
...I just want my egg back.
I want my house back.

487
00:42:54,037 --> 00:42:55,231
I have a lot of work to do.

488
00:42:58,141 --> 00:42:59,972
Did you have a good time last night?

489
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:06,144
You mean when we got back here?

490
00:43:07,150 --> 00:43:08,242
I think you know what I mean.

491
00:43:15,559 --> 00:43:17,254
I had a great time.

492
00:43:20,664 --> 00:43:23,155
Don't tell me I owe you another $300.

493
00:43:25,268 --> 00:43:26,895
Did I say you owe me anything?

494
00:43:29,906 --> 00:43:30,600
No, you didn't.

495
00:43:30,674 --> 00:43:32,835
I don't remember saying
that you owe me anything.

496
00:43:39,015 --> 00:43:41,006
What about my mother's egg?

497
00:43:42,185 --> 00:43:45,518
You're the one who's going to college,
you figure it out.

498
00:43:49,793 --> 00:43:50,782
How much time do you need?

499
00:43:51,595 --> 00:43:54,291
I need enough time to make
some telephone calls.

500
00:43:54,598 --> 00:43:57,032
I have to figure out how
to get my stuff back.

501
00:43:57,367 --> 00:44:00,029
Guido has probably locked me
out of the apartment by now.

502
00:44:01,037 --> 00:44:01,969
All right!

503
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:05,200
But will you do me a favor?

504
00:44:06,376 --> 00:44:07,365
Anything, cookie.

505
00:44:09,813 --> 00:44:11,542
Don't steal anything!

506
00:44:14,317 --> 00:44:16,547
If I come back here,
and find anything missing...

507
00:44:18,388 --> 00:44:21,050
...I'm going straight to the police.
I'm not joking!

508
00:44:22,392 --> 00:44:24,553
Joel, go to school.
Go learn something.

509
00:44:39,910 --> 00:44:41,343
Can I see your pass, please!

510
00:44:43,647 --> 00:44:46,980
I'm sure you've all studied
chapters six through eight...

511
00:44:47,417 --> 00:44:49,647
...so here's a little pop quiz
to confirm it.

512
00:44:49,986 --> 00:44:51,647
Will you put your books
on the floor, please?

513
00:45:15,512 --> 00:45:16,501
You didn't tell anyone, did you?

514
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:17,938
No. Glenn knows.

515
00:45:18,882 --> 00:45:20,042
What about Barry?

516
00:45:20,116 --> 00:45:21,276
He knows, too.

517
00:45:21,685 --> 00:45:22,674
Don't tell anyone else!

518
00:45:23,787 --> 00:45:25,118
I won't! I won't!

519
00:45:34,965 --> 00:45:38,298
Lab reports are to be on my desk
by tomorrow afternoon.

520
00:45:39,302 --> 00:45:40,963
All reports must be typed.

521
00:45:56,987 --> 00:45:58,648
Don't forget,
term papers are due Friday.

522
00:45:59,322 --> 00:46:01,984
They count for 50%
of this semester's grades.

523
00:46:04,227 --> 00:46:05,057
Damn it!

524
00:46:15,005 --> 00:46:15,937
Hey, Miles, what's happening?

525
00:46:16,239 --> 00:46:17,228
I'm waiting for Glenn.

526
00:46:18,074 --> 00:46:19,063
Glenn? Where is he?

527
00:46:19,442 --> 00:46:20,340
Inside.

528
00:46:21,244 --> 00:46:22,233
In the house?!

529
00:46:22,579 --> 00:46:23,568
He wanted to meet her!

530
00:46:26,449 --> 00:46:27,245
What are you doing?

531
00:46:27,584 --> 00:46:28,448
I was inside.

532
00:46:28,685 --> 00:46:29,674
I can see that.

533
00:46:32,989 --> 00:46:34,650
You're home now.

534
00:46:35,025 --> 00:46:36,356
Yeah, I live here, remember?

535
00:46:39,763 --> 00:46:40,457
Glenn?

536
00:46:44,267 --> 00:46:46,258
Tell me you didn't do
anything with her.

537
00:46:46,603 --> 00:46:47,592
Who, Lana?

538
00:46:48,271 --> 00:46:48,965
Yeah, Lana.

539
00:46:49,606 --> 00:46:50,664
Nothing.

540
00:46:50,740 --> 00:46:52,332
I met her.

541
00:46:52,409 --> 00:46:53,467
She's nice.

542
00:46:54,110 --> 00:46:55,475
You're sure you didn't do anything?

543
00:46:56,713 --> 00:46:58,044
Yeah, I swear.

544
00:46:58,481 --> 00:47:00,108
You did it with her, didn't you, Glenn?

545
00:47:01,217 --> 00:47:03,879
I did not do it with her, Joel!

546
00:47:10,627 --> 00:47:11,992
Ask me about Vicki!

547
00:47:13,063 --> 00:47:14,394
Who is Vicki?

548
00:47:14,898 --> 00:47:16,229
Owe you one!

549
00:47:20,236 --> 00:47:23,228
Are you Joel?
Nice place you have here.

550
00:47:24,574 --> 00:47:25,302
Where's Lana?

551
00:47:25,809 --> 00:47:26,571
In the den.

552
00:47:27,010 --> 00:47:28,307
I like your friend!

553
00:47:30,146 --> 00:47:31,807
Get out! I'm not kidding!

554
00:47:32,315 --> 00:47:33,304
What's your problem?

555
00:47:36,019 --> 00:47:38,010
Just leave! Please!

556
00:47:38,588 --> 00:47:41,250
Look, we're not ripping
you off or anything.

557
00:47:45,762 --> 00:47:46,751
What is this for?

558
00:47:47,097 --> 00:47:49,429
$50 goes to the house!
You're the house!

559
00:47:51,835 --> 00:47:54,531
I am not the house!

560
00:47:55,271 --> 00:47:57,102
Just leave! I mean it!

561
00:47:59,109 --> 00:48:00,098
He's mad, Vicki.

562
00:48:00,777 --> 00:48:02,608
Already? I just got here!

563
00:48:03,113 --> 00:48:04,273
I think he wants us to go.

564
00:48:05,281 --> 00:48:06,270
Do you want us to go?

565
00:48:10,553 --> 00:48:11,349
Thank you.

566
00:48:37,814 --> 00:48:39,475
I don't want any problems.

567
00:48:39,816 --> 00:48:41,750
Do you know what
you did to me last night?

568
00:48:41,818 --> 00:48:42,807
I don't care!

569
00:48:45,822 --> 00:48:48,313
I don't want to see you
or do anything with you anymore.

570
00:48:48,391 --> 00:48:49,380
Get in the car!

571
00:49:13,249 --> 00:49:14,238
Excuse me.

572
00:49:15,919 --> 00:49:16,908
What can I do for you?

573
00:49:18,121 --> 00:49:19,110
Who are you?

574
00:49:25,628 --> 00:49:27,619
Are you the kid I chased last night?

575
00:49:29,766 --> 00:49:31,757
Is there something I can help you with?

576
00:49:32,769 --> 00:49:34,703
You shouldn't drive like that.

577
00:49:34,771 --> 00:49:37,433
People get hurt all the time.

578
00:49:38,208 --> 00:49:40,904
Are you a smart kid?

579
00:49:40,977 --> 00:49:42,274
You look like a smart kid.

580
00:49:43,012 --> 00:49:44,343
I'm okay.

581
00:49:44,380 --> 00:49:45,711
Where are the girls? Inside?

582
00:49:48,885 --> 00:49:51,547
I'm sorry, but I'll have
to ask you to leave.

583
00:49:56,459 --> 00:49:58,450
The door is locked.

584
00:49:59,162 --> 00:50:00,789
You're starting to give me
a stomachache.

585
00:50:01,164 --> 00:50:02,461
Good! I hope it hurts!

586
00:50:04,067 --> 00:50:05,056
Are you going to open the door?

587
00:50:05,568 --> 00:50:07,900
Guido, go home!
We don't need you anymore!

588
00:50:08,238 --> 00:50:09,227
Shut your mouth!

589
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:12,572
Listen, maybe we don't
work for you anymore!

590
00:50:14,677 --> 00:50:15,735
Then who do you work for?

591
00:50:16,079 --> 00:50:17,410
Who? If you aren't working for me?

592
00:50:18,748 --> 00:50:20,181
Maybe we work for Joel, now.

593
00:50:22,585 --> 00:50:23,574
She's only kidding.

594
00:50:24,587 --> 00:50:25,576
I hope so.

595
00:50:27,924 --> 00:50:30,586
Joel, you look like a smart kid.

596
00:50:31,995 --> 00:50:34,930
I'm going to tell you something
I'm sure you'll understand.

597
00:50:36,332 --> 00:50:38,323
You're having fun now, right?

598
00:50:39,335 --> 00:50:41,599
Right, Joel? The time of your life.

599
00:50:43,506 --> 00:50:48,205
In a sluggish economy, never, ever
fuck with another man's livelihood!

600
00:50:49,946 --> 00:50:53,712
If you're smart, like I hope you are...

601
00:50:55,952 --> 00:50:58,216
...you aren't going to make me
come back here.

602
00:51:07,297 --> 00:51:08,127
Thank you, Joel.

603
00:51:11,968 --> 00:51:12,866
This is very decent of you.

604
00:51:13,469 --> 00:51:15,130
Just as long as we understand
each other.

605
00:51:16,306 --> 00:51:19,298
One night, then you find
another place to stay.

606
00:51:19,642 --> 00:51:22,042
As soon as we get in touch with Tandy,
we'll have a place.

607
00:51:22,111 --> 00:51:24,443
-Did you try her again?
-She's still out.

608
00:51:25,048 --> 00:51:26,379
And my mother's egg?

609
00:51:27,150 --> 00:51:29,141
If I can get my stuff back,
I can get the egg.

610
00:51:30,987 --> 00:51:31,976
Then you'll leave?

611
00:51:32,388 --> 00:51:33,753
Then we'll leave.

612
00:51:34,991 --> 00:51:37,983
Oh, I don't know, Lana.
He has such nice friends.

613
00:51:38,328 --> 00:51:39,989
Clean, polite, quick.

614
00:51:41,164 --> 00:51:42,756
I think there's a future here.

615
00:52:02,085 --> 00:52:03,074
What are you studying?

616
00:52:05,021 --> 00:52:07,353
It's a workshop...

617
00:52:07,423 --> 00:52:08,515
...on free enterprise.

618
00:52:15,298 --> 00:52:19,291
We make a product,
and then we try to market it.

619
00:52:21,437 --> 00:52:23,098
Do you make a lot of money?

620
00:52:24,207 --> 00:52:25,196
No. Not really.

621
00:52:29,312 --> 00:52:30,370
No, but we...

622
00:52:31,781 --> 00:52:33,942
...get to compete with other
student companies.

623
00:52:34,384 --> 00:52:35,715
Actually, it's fucked!

624
00:52:37,020 --> 00:52:38,612
I'm just kidding.

625
00:52:39,822 --> 00:52:41,687
It's really quite competitive.

626
00:52:46,129 --> 00:52:47,460
Do you ever get high, Joel?

627
00:52:49,899 --> 00:52:51,230
Yeah. All the time.

628
00:52:52,135 --> 00:52:55,229
You see, Vicki and I were
thinking about getting high.

629
00:52:56,406 --> 00:52:59,739
Maybe going out and
getting some ice cream?

630
00:53:01,911 --> 00:53:02,900
You want to come?

631
00:53:08,818 --> 00:53:11,218
I could go for some
ice cream right now.

632
00:53:23,866 --> 00:53:24,855
Are you stoned?

633
00:53:25,601 --> 00:53:27,592
No. I do not believe so.

634
00:53:29,872 --> 00:53:31,362
I think you're really wasted!

635
00:53:32,775 --> 00:53:35,175
This is not wasted, Barry.

636
00:53:35,244 --> 00:53:36,768
This is definitely not wasted.

637
00:53:42,185 --> 00:53:42,879
Barry?

638
00:53:46,956 --> 00:53:49,288
-I'm a little wasted!
-I know.

639
00:53:52,528 --> 00:53:55,224
-Don't let me do anything stupid.
-Don't worry.

640
00:53:59,202 --> 00:54:00,191
Want to take a walk?

641
00:54:07,710 --> 00:54:08,768
Do you like living at home?

642
00:54:12,048 --> 00:54:13,640
It's all right.

643
00:54:13,716 --> 00:54:15,206
I'll be out next year.

644
00:54:15,551 --> 00:54:16,882
I'll bet your folks are nice people.

645
00:54:18,287 --> 00:54:19,948
And they won't be home till Sunday?

646
00:54:20,723 --> 00:54:21,382
Yeah.

647
00:54:22,892 --> 00:54:25,258
Because, I was thinking.

648
00:54:25,328 --> 00:54:26,989
I mean, after your friend came over...

649
00:54:27,063 --> 00:54:28,052
...I couldn't believe it!

650
00:54:28,965 --> 00:54:30,956
A kid our age walks in with a $100!

651
00:54:32,402 --> 00:54:33,130
Glenn.

652
00:54:34,137 --> 00:54:36,128
Where did he get that kind of change?

653
00:54:36,739 --> 00:54:37,637
I don't know.

654
00:54:39,142 --> 00:54:41,133
He said he cashed a bond.

655
00:54:42,478 --> 00:54:43,968
You people have a lot of bonds.

656
00:54:48,151 --> 00:54:49,482
So, I was thinking....

657
00:54:51,654 --> 00:54:54,646
If we could ever bring our friends
together, we'd make a fortune!

658
00:54:56,259 --> 00:54:57,419
Yeah. You're right.

659
00:54:59,429 --> 00:55:00,418
Do you want to do it?

660
00:55:01,497 --> 00:55:02,156
Do what?

661
00:55:02,498 --> 00:55:04,489
Get our friends together
in the next few days.

662
00:55:07,270 --> 00:55:09,261
No. I don't think so.

663
00:55:11,441 --> 00:55:14,433
Make some money.
Be a little enterpriser.

664
00:55:14,777 --> 00:55:15,675
Future enterpriser.

665
00:55:18,014 --> 00:55:19,345
Be whatever you want to be.

666
00:55:25,955 --> 00:55:29,356
What if I agreed to be
your girlfriend the next few nights?

667
00:55:30,460 --> 00:55:31,290
No charge?

668
00:55:34,130 --> 00:55:36,462
Hey, I'm not trying to force
this idea on you.

669
00:55:37,633 --> 00:55:39,999
It's just that my mind keeps working
all the time.

670
00:55:40,403 --> 00:55:43,895
Nothing I can do about it.
It keeps working and working.

671
00:55:57,420 --> 00:55:58,409
You warm enough?

672
00:55:58,988 --> 00:55:59,977
I'm okay.

673
00:56:06,562 --> 00:56:08,393
Why did you leave home?

674
00:56:10,333 --> 00:56:10,992
Why?

675
00:56:12,568 --> 00:56:13,899
I'm just curious.

676
00:56:17,840 --> 00:56:20,832
Because my step-father
kept coming on to me.

677
00:56:23,679 --> 00:56:25,340
What else do you want to know?

678
00:56:29,852 --> 00:56:31,843
Do you have any brothers and sisters?

679
00:56:33,689 --> 00:56:35,782
I have a brother.

680
00:56:35,858 --> 00:56:36,916
What else?

681
00:56:38,194 --> 00:56:39,525
If you don't want to talk....

682
00:56:39,862 --> 00:56:40,851
No, No. Ask me anything.

683
00:56:41,197 --> 00:56:43,188
I don't think you want
to talk and that's okay.

684
00:56:43,533 --> 00:56:45,194
No, I really want to talk to you.

685
00:56:49,038 --> 00:56:50,027
What does he do?

686
00:56:51,374 --> 00:56:52,363
He goes to school.

687
00:56:55,444 --> 00:56:56,775
Why aren't you going to school?

688
00:56:57,880 --> 00:56:58,869
I'm not my brother.

689
00:57:06,155 --> 00:57:08,487
I'm really trying to be
friends with you.

690
00:57:08,724 --> 00:57:11,716
But I'd appreciate it if you'd
stop trying to judge me...

691
00:57:12,061 --> 00:57:15,053
...while you're leaning on your
daddy's $40,000 car.

692
00:57:19,302 --> 00:57:20,291
I'll see you around.

693
00:57:27,743 --> 00:57:29,074
Was it something I said?

694
00:57:36,152 --> 00:57:39,747
You locked the door!
The keys are inside the car!

695
00:57:40,156 --> 00:57:42,818
Please! Stop! Stop! Stop!

696
00:57:59,108 --> 00:58:01,099
Please stop! Please stop!

697
00:58:33,643 --> 00:58:35,133
Oh, thank you.

698
00:58:35,211 --> 00:58:36,143
Thank you.

699
00:59:19,522 --> 00:59:21,183
All right, everyone watch your feet!

700
00:59:39,608 --> 00:59:40,597
Are you okay?

701
00:59:44,046 --> 00:59:45,035
Do you want an aspirin?

702
00:59:49,885 --> 00:59:51,216
Does your dad own a gun?

703
00:59:56,058 --> 00:59:57,548
Who's the U-boat commander?

704
01:00:12,408 --> 01:00:16,401
You're right. You are absolutely
right to respond this way.

705
01:00:17,246 --> 01:00:18,907
I did not have a doctor's appointment.

706
01:00:19,482 --> 01:00:20,972
But I will tell you
exactly what happened.

707
01:00:22,585 --> 01:00:24,143
" Unexcused." You see, Nurse Bolan...

708
01:00:24,253 --> 01:00:27,245
...If you write "unexcused,"
I fail two mid-terms.

709
01:00:27,423 --> 01:00:29,755
It will ruin my whole
grade point average!

710
01:00:30,926 --> 01:00:35,590
If you'll just stop and listen to me,
I'll explain everything.

711
01:00:40,669 --> 01:00:44,161
The truth is, my parents are away,
and I met this girl.

712
01:00:46,108 --> 01:00:48,770
A call girl, actually.
She came to my house.

713
01:00:50,613 --> 01:00:52,376
Look, you're writing again!

714
01:00:52,448 --> 01:00:53,608
This is not " unexcused"!

715
01:00:55,451 --> 01:00:58,784
If you will just listen to me,
then you'll understand, Nurse Bolan.

716
01:01:00,956 --> 01:01:02,617
Why? Why won't you listen to me?

717
01:01:02,958 --> 01:01:04,289
I had a doctor's appointment.

718
01:01:09,465 --> 01:01:10,454
Excuse me.

719
01:01:11,467 --> 01:01:14,800
It wasn't the girl,
it was my father's car.

720
01:01:15,137 --> 01:01:17,105
I put my father's car
into Lake Michigan...

721
01:01:17,173 --> 01:01:19,141
...and I had to get it fixed.

722
01:01:21,644 --> 01:01:22,975
Just give me a break.

723
01:01:28,150 --> 01:01:29,139
Let me say it another way.

724
01:01:30,152 --> 01:01:34,816
I have spent the last four years of my
life busting my butt in this shithole!

725
01:01:38,327 --> 01:01:39,316
I'm sorry.

726
01:01:39,662 --> 01:01:44,326
I don't think I can leave until I get
just a little compassion from you.

727
01:01:50,339 --> 01:01:51,169
What did he get?

728
01:01:51,740 --> 01:01:54,675
Suspension, five days.

729
01:01:54,743 --> 01:01:56,540
They kicked him out of
Future Enterprisers, too.

730
01:01:56,612 --> 01:01:58,603
Shit! They ruined his whole record!

731
01:01:58,848 --> 01:02:00,509
What's he going to do about the car?

732
01:02:04,854 --> 01:02:05,843
Are you all right, Joel?

733
01:02:08,357 --> 01:02:09,187
I'm all right.

734
01:02:20,269 --> 01:02:21,258
I need a bike.

735
01:02:22,137 --> 01:02:23,001
He needs a bike.

736
01:02:23,205 --> 01:02:25,196
-Glenn, can I borrow your bike?!
-Jesus, Glenn!

737
01:02:25,875 --> 01:02:26,864
Sure. Here, use mine.

738
01:04:57,926 --> 01:04:59,917
It was great the way her mind worked.

739
01:05:00,429 --> 01:05:02,420
No guilt, no doubts, no fear.

740
01:05:03,365 --> 01:05:04,696
None of my specialties.

741
01:05:08,871 --> 01:05:12,534
Just this shameless pursuit of
immediate material gratification.

742
01:05:13,876 --> 01:05:15,207
What a capitalist!

743
01:05:18,714 --> 01:05:22,047
She told me I could earn more money
in one night than I'd make all year.

744
01:05:22,785 --> 01:05:24,548
Enough to pay for my father's car.

745
01:05:25,387 --> 01:05:27,378
She told me she'd be my girlfriend.

746
01:05:30,793 --> 01:05:32,852
She told me a lot of things.

747
01:05:32,928 --> 01:05:33,895
I believed them all.

748
01:05:35,397 --> 01:05:37,058
So, she introduced me to her friends.

749
01:05:43,405 --> 01:05:45,066
" Now when I was a young boy

750
01:05:47,142 --> 01:05:48,632
"At the age of five

751
01:05:50,479 --> 01:05:52,470
"My Mother said I was going to be

752
01:05:53,816 --> 01:05:55,408
"The greatest man alive

753
01:05:57,152 --> 01:05:58,744
" But now I'm a man

754
01:06:00,756 --> 01:06:02,314
"Way past twenty-one

755
01:06:03,992 --> 01:06:05,584
" I want you to believe me, baby

756
01:06:07,329 --> 01:06:08,921
" I have lots of fun

757
01:06:10,833 --> 01:06:11,993
" I'm a Man"

758
01:06:15,104 --> 01:06:16,765
I introduced her to my friends.

759
01:06:24,847 --> 01:06:26,838
We made Barry our treasurer.

760
01:06:30,018 --> 01:06:31,349
Lana did production.

761
01:06:32,688 --> 01:06:35,020
I concentrated on sales.

762
01:06:35,791 --> 01:06:37,952
So, you took her out to dinner twice.

763
01:06:38,460 --> 01:06:39,449
How much did that cost you?

764
01:06:40,696 --> 01:06:41,526
About $30.

765
01:06:41,864 --> 01:06:42,523
With tip?

766
01:06:43,132 --> 01:06:44,463
Okay, maybe $35.

767
01:06:44,967 --> 01:06:46,457
Did you take her to any movies?

768
01:06:46,802 --> 01:06:47,700
Three movies.

769
01:06:48,203 --> 01:06:49,534
$20.

770
01:06:50,472 --> 01:06:51,200
Parking?

771
01:06:51,540 --> 01:06:52,529
I park on the street.

772
01:06:53,375 --> 01:06:54,137
Gas?

773
01:06:55,878 --> 01:06:57,140
Maybe $6.

774
01:06:59,481 --> 01:07:02,814
All right, Stan,
you've paid out approximately $60.

775
01:07:09,091 --> 01:07:10,251
What happened?

776
01:07:11,894 --> 01:07:13,225
She slept with Jacobsen.

777
01:07:17,833 --> 01:07:18,822
That's all I'm saying.

778
01:07:21,837 --> 01:07:23,498
" I can make love to you, woman

779
01:07:25,007 --> 01:07:26,668
" In five minutes' time

780
01:07:28,243 --> 01:07:29,574
"Ain't that a man?"

781
01:07:36,351 --> 01:07:38,342
Do you know what he said? Afterwards?

782
01:07:40,355 --> 01:07:43,051
He said the lady had knowledge.

783
01:07:43,125 --> 01:07:44,854
And he was glad to get that knowledge.

784
01:07:45,761 --> 01:07:46,591
Do you know why?

785
01:07:47,529 --> 01:07:48,188
Why?

786
01:07:49,031 --> 01:07:52,967
Because college girls
can smell ignorance...

787
01:07:53,035 --> 01:07:54,195
...Iike dog shit.

788
01:07:54,937 --> 01:07:55,869
I'll think about it.

789
01:07:57,372 --> 01:07:58,805
Where are you going
to school next year?

790
01:07:58,874 --> 01:07:59,704
Wisconsin.

791
01:08:00,375 --> 01:08:03,037
Wisconsin?

792
01:08:03,111 --> 01:08:04,043
Big school.

793
01:08:23,899 --> 01:08:26,993
All I'm telling you is...

794
01:08:27,069 --> 01:08:28,229
...walk like a man.

795
01:08:56,765 --> 01:08:59,427
Joel! This is a great party!

796
01:09:00,836 --> 01:09:02,167
Are you having a good time?

797
01:09:11,013 --> 01:09:13,447
Excellent idea, Joel!
Really excellent.

798
01:09:20,022 --> 01:09:22,354
Some of the girls are wearing
my mother's clothing.

799
01:09:22,791 --> 01:09:23,780
What's wrong with that?

800
01:09:24,126 --> 01:09:26,253
I don't want to spend the rest
of my life in analysis.

801
01:09:26,328 --> 01:09:27,317
Just talk to them, okay?

802
01:09:27,629 --> 01:09:28,618
All right.

803
01:10:13,508 --> 01:10:14,839
Is Howie Rifkin here?

804
01:10:15,444 --> 01:10:16,775
You're on, honey.

805
01:10:39,801 --> 01:10:42,463
Joel! Somebody is at
the front door for you.

806
01:10:42,804 --> 01:10:44,465
All right, thank you.
I'll be right there.

807
01:10:46,541 --> 01:10:49,135
The thing is...

808
01:10:49,544 --> 01:10:51,205
...I don't have to pay for it.

809
01:10:54,149 --> 01:10:55,138
I get it anyway.

810
01:11:01,156 --> 01:11:03,488
I'd better get going.
I'll miss the party.

811
01:11:09,164 --> 01:11:11,496
Whatever you want to do....

812
01:11:25,514 --> 01:11:27,505
Excuse me? Can I help you?

813
01:11:28,016 --> 01:11:28,846
Are you Joel?

814
01:11:29,918 --> 01:11:30,748
Yes.

815
01:11:30,919 --> 01:11:32,580
Bill Rutherford, Princeton Admissions.

816
01:11:32,854 --> 01:11:34,685
I believe we have
an interview scheduled.

817
01:11:35,857 --> 01:11:37,586
If this is inconvenient for you--

818
01:11:37,926 --> 01:11:39,257
No, sir. It's fine.

819
01:11:49,704 --> 01:11:51,365
Excuse me, can I use the room?

820
01:11:55,043 --> 01:11:57,773
Also, would you answer the phone
if anyone calls, please.

821
01:11:58,213 --> 01:12:01,205
I understand that you would like
to attend Princeton.

822
01:12:02,384 --> 01:12:04,375
Yes, sir, very much.

823
01:12:04,519 --> 01:12:06,544
Well, fine.

824
01:12:06,621 --> 01:12:08,680
Let's take a look at what we have,
shall we?

825
01:12:23,305 --> 01:12:24,294
Does this couch open?

826
01:12:25,640 --> 01:12:26,629
Lana, I'm in a meeting.

827
01:12:27,142 --> 01:12:28,131
We need the room.

828
01:12:29,244 --> 01:12:30,905
Yeah. I need a few minutes, okay?

829
01:12:37,319 --> 01:12:39,651
Now, you've taken
your SATs already.

830
01:12:39,988 --> 01:12:44,652
Math, 597. Verbal, 560. Correct me
if my information is inaccurate.

831
01:12:45,760 --> 01:12:48,752
Well, yes, but I was planning
on taking those tests again.

832
01:12:49,097 --> 01:12:52,931
Fine. Now, your grade
point average is 3.14.

833
01:12:53,268 --> 01:12:54,758
You rank 52 in your class.

834
01:12:55,337 --> 01:12:58,170
That places you in the 84th percentile.
Is that correct?

835
01:12:59,608 --> 01:13:02,270
Joel, this is my cousin,
Ruben, from Skokie.

836
01:13:02,611 --> 01:13:03,600
Can you get him in tonight?

837
01:13:03,979 --> 01:13:05,310
Not now, okay?

838
01:13:05,447 --> 01:13:08,280
-He has to be home by 12:00.
-All right, later guys.

839
01:13:14,256 --> 01:13:15,245
Excuse me.

840
01:13:17,626 --> 01:13:19,457
And you wish to major in?

841
01:13:22,130 --> 01:13:22,789
Business.

842
01:13:24,199 --> 01:13:26,190
Business. Yes.

843
01:13:30,705 --> 01:13:32,036
I'll be out in a second.

844
01:13:37,145 --> 01:13:39,545
Fine, well, let us review
your other activities.

845
01:13:40,315 --> 01:13:44,649
"Junior Varsity Tennis Team.
Recording Secretary, Spanish Club.

846
01:13:46,655 --> 01:13:48,953
"Varsity Tract Team, one year.

847
01:13:49,024 --> 01:13:51,322
" Honorable Mention,
Cook County Science Fair.

848
01:13:53,328 --> 01:13:56,661
" Future Enterprisers.
Yearbook Staff.

849
01:13:57,899 --> 01:13:59,560
"Student Council, two years. "

850
01:14:01,836 --> 01:14:05,499
Well, Joel, this is very respectable.

851
01:14:06,007 --> 01:14:07,998
You've done some very solid work here.

852
01:14:09,578 --> 01:14:11,569
But it isn't quite lvy League, is it?

853
01:14:17,752 --> 01:14:20,448
You know, Bill...

854
01:14:20,855 --> 01:14:23,915
...there's one thing I've learned
in all my years.

855
01:14:24,526 --> 01:14:28,360
Sometimes you have to say,
"What the fuck."

856
01:14:28,430 --> 01:14:29,522
Make your move.

857
01:14:31,866 --> 01:14:32,855
I beg your pardon?

858
01:14:35,704 --> 01:14:36,864
So, how are you doing?

859
01:14:38,039 --> 01:14:40,030
Looks like University of lllinois!

860
01:14:40,375 --> 01:14:42,366
"All right, all right!

861
01:14:42,944 --> 01:14:45,378
"Dance, Music, Sex, Romance!

862
01:14:45,880 --> 01:14:49,714
"Everybody say, Oooh, all right!

863
01:14:51,386 --> 01:14:54,378
" Dance, Music, Sex, Romance!

864
01:14:57,726 --> 01:15:00,388
" Everybody clap your hands now! "

865
01:15:23,151 --> 01:15:25,483
Some of your friends
are looking for you.

866
01:15:28,490 --> 01:15:30,151
What do you want me to tell them?

867
01:15:33,995 --> 01:15:35,656
Did that guy from Princeton leave yet?

868
01:15:36,498 --> 01:15:38,932
No, he's still here.
He's talking to some of the girls.

869
01:15:39,601 --> 01:15:40,431
Talking?

870
01:15:41,269 --> 01:15:42,600
They're very good talkers.

871
01:15:46,107 --> 01:15:49,099
I don't think I'm going to say,
"What the fuck" anymore.

872
01:15:50,278 --> 01:15:53,611
This thing has gotten out of control.

873
01:15:55,684 --> 01:15:57,015
I'm going to kill Miles.

874
01:15:58,119 --> 01:15:59,609
Oh, come on, Joel.

875
01:16:02,357 --> 01:16:05,451
Look at it this way.
You're making a lot of money.

876
01:16:06,127 --> 01:16:08,857
You're providing your friends
with an invaluable service.

877
01:16:08,930 --> 01:16:10,795
God knows, they needed the service!

878
01:16:12,200 --> 01:16:15,863
And, right now, you are one
hot shit future enterpriser.

879
01:16:20,375 --> 01:16:23,469
Don't worry so much. I'll be upstairs.

880
01:16:26,815 --> 01:16:29,477
And...you have yourself
a girlfriend to boot.

881
01:16:30,485 --> 01:16:31,144
Do l?

882
01:16:31,486 --> 01:16:32,475
Telephone call for Joel.

883
01:16:33,388 --> 01:16:34,218
Here, I'll get it.

884
01:16:35,724 --> 01:16:36,656
Well, do l?

885
01:16:39,327 --> 01:16:40,316
What do you think?

886
01:16:41,229 --> 01:16:42,321
I don't know. You tell me.

887
01:16:43,331 --> 01:16:44,662
Yes? No? Maybe?

888
01:16:47,001 --> 01:16:47,899
Yes.

889
01:16:50,672 --> 01:16:51,331
No.

890
01:16:54,909 --> 01:16:55,739
Maybe.

891
01:17:00,682 --> 01:17:01,512
Joel!

892
01:17:02,851 --> 01:17:03,545
Dad?

893
01:17:03,852 --> 01:17:04,841
Who answered the telephone?

894
01:17:05,687 --> 01:17:07,018
Just a friend, Dad.

895
01:17:07,355 --> 01:17:08,185
Do I know her?

896
01:17:08,523 --> 01:17:10,013
Have you ever made love
on a real train?

897
01:17:10,358 --> 01:17:11,518
I don't think so.

898
01:17:12,193 --> 01:17:13,182
He's got a girl.

899
01:17:14,195 --> 01:17:16,026
Let's make love on a real train.

900
01:17:17,031 --> 01:17:17,861
Joel, are you there?

901
01:17:18,199 --> 01:17:22,533
I'm still here, Dad. How is Mom?
Is everything all right?

902
01:17:22,871 --> 01:17:23,769
Let's go.

903
01:17:23,938 --> 01:17:24,927
Do I hear other voices?

904
01:17:27,041 --> 01:17:28,531
Just a few friends, Dad.

905
01:17:32,614 --> 01:17:33,706
Sounds like a party.

906
01:17:35,216 --> 01:17:36,046
A party?!

907
01:17:36,885 --> 01:17:38,216
Come on, let's be alone together.

908
01:17:38,887 --> 01:17:41,549
I don't remember giving
permission for a party, Joel.

909
01:17:44,292 --> 01:17:46,886
Honey, can you hear me?

910
01:17:46,961 --> 01:17:48,952
There's nothing wrong
with having friends over.

911
01:17:49,397 --> 01:17:52,059
Just use your best judgment.
We trust you.

912
01:17:52,801 --> 01:17:55,827
Remember, we're arriving tomorrow
at 3:00, United Airlines, Flight 162.

913
01:17:55,904 --> 01:17:57,735
"Trust."

914
01:17:57,806 --> 01:18:00,502
Seems to me if there is any logic
to our language...

915
01:18:00,575 --> 01:18:02,406
..."trust" would be a four-letter word.

916
01:18:04,913 --> 01:18:08,076
The evening worked out well.
We had a good cash flow.

917
01:18:09,250 --> 01:18:11,411
Rutherford made a few new friends.

918
01:18:12,587 --> 01:18:13,986
He said he'd do his best for me.

919
01:18:22,263 --> 01:18:23,924
Finally, it was time to close shop.

920
01:18:25,767 --> 01:18:27,257
The girls were exhausted.

921
01:18:28,102 --> 01:18:30,696
Lana was hungry.
She wanted to go out for a bite.

922
01:18:32,106 --> 01:18:34,438
She wanted to make love
on a real train.

923
01:18:35,677 --> 01:18:37,008
Who was I to say no?

924
01:18:39,280 --> 01:18:43,774
" I can feel it coming
in the air tonight

925
01:18:49,624 --> 01:18:54,288
"And I've been waiting for
this moment for all my life

926
01:18:59,467 --> 01:19:01,458
"Can you feel it coming"

927
01:19:01,803 --> 01:19:03,794
I thought no one was going to be here.

928
01:19:06,307 --> 01:19:07,296
Be patient.

929
01:19:18,653 --> 01:19:23,317
"Well, I remember, I remember -
don't worry

930
01:19:25,727 --> 01:19:30,391
" How could I ever forget?
It's the first time -

931
01:19:32,066 --> 01:19:35,399
"The last time we ever met

932
01:19:38,740 --> 01:19:42,073
" But I know the reason

933
01:19:42,410 --> 01:19:45,402
"Why you keep the silence up

934
01:19:46,014 --> 01:19:48,005
" No, you don't fool me

935
01:19:49,350 --> 01:19:51,011
"The hurt doesn't show

936
01:19:51,753 --> 01:19:54,085
" But the pain still grows

937
01:19:54,422 --> 01:19:57,084
" It's no stranger to you or me

938
01:20:00,194 --> 01:20:04,688
" I can feel it coming
in the air tonight

939
01:20:10,772 --> 01:20:15,436
"Well, I've been waiting for
this moment for all my life

940
01:20:20,615 --> 01:20:25,279
" I can feel it coming
in the air tonight"

941
01:24:14,148 --> 01:24:14,807
Hi.

942
01:24:15,149 --> 01:24:16,810
They stole the goddamn house, Lana!

943
01:24:17,151 --> 01:24:18,140
I'm not here right now.

944
01:24:18,919 --> 01:24:20,978
But if you'll leave
your name and number,

945
01:24:21,055 --> 01:24:22,818
I'll call you back as soon as possible.

946
01:24:24,425 --> 01:24:26,325
They took everything!

947
01:24:26,393 --> 01:24:27,257
This is unbelievable!

948
01:24:27,595 --> 01:24:30,792
My parents will be home in two hours,
Lana, and they took fucking everything!

949
01:24:31,265 --> 01:24:33,529
I don't know if you know
anything about this.

950
01:24:33,601 --> 01:24:35,262
But you have to call me right away!

951
01:24:35,603 --> 01:24:37,002
I'm at the house: KL5-2121.

952
01:24:37,605 --> 01:24:39,596
Look, you've really got to help me!

953
01:24:40,608 --> 01:24:41,939
Time of your life, huh, kid?

954
01:24:43,110 --> 01:24:44,099
Where's Lana?

955
01:24:44,445 --> 01:24:45,673
Maybe she's on the choo-choo.

956
01:24:46,113 --> 01:24:48,445
I understand she has a thing
about choo-choos.

957
01:24:49,016 --> 01:24:50,779
I want to know who stole my things.

958
01:24:51,118 --> 01:24:53,609
Oh, I took your things,
Joel, are you kidding?

959
01:24:54,355 --> 01:24:56,448
Then you listen to me, buster!

960
01:24:56,524 --> 01:24:57,513
You a-hole!

961
01:24:57,958 --> 01:24:59,289
If I don't get my things back--

962
01:25:00,361 --> 01:25:01,259
Shit!

963
01:25:11,038 --> 01:25:11,970
A-hole?!

964
01:25:12,973 --> 01:25:15,134
I want my furniture back, right now!

965
01:25:16,143 --> 01:25:16,973
Now, you listen to me.

966
01:25:17,311 --> 01:25:19,302
Oh, no, no!
You listen to me!

967
01:25:20,881 --> 01:25:21,575
Shit!

968
01:25:28,489 --> 01:25:29,820
This is getting boring.

969
01:25:30,324 --> 01:25:33,657
Can I have my furniture back?
Please?

970
01:25:34,161 --> 01:25:36,152
You listen to me, you little fuck!

971
01:25:37,665 --> 01:25:39,496
You not only took my two best girls!

972
01:25:40,401 --> 01:25:43,063
You call me names and insult me!

973
01:25:44,071 --> 01:25:44,833
I'm sorry.

974
01:25:45,172 --> 01:25:46,833
If I had any self-respect...

975
01:25:47,174 --> 01:25:49,165
...it wouldn't be your furniture!

976
01:25:49,510 --> 01:25:53,674
It would be your legs! Your arms!
Your head!

977
01:25:55,182 --> 01:25:56,513
Do we understand each other?

978
01:25:56,850 --> 01:25:57,839
Yes, we do.

979
01:25:58,252 --> 01:26:00,914
No! Do we understand each other?

980
01:26:02,590 --> 01:26:03,852
Yes, we understand each other.

981
01:26:07,261 --> 01:26:08,421
Well, you're lucky in one respect.

982
01:26:10,698 --> 01:26:11,357
What's that?

983
01:26:13,367 --> 01:26:14,425
I like you, Joel.

984
01:26:16,704 --> 01:26:17,693
Don't you know that?

985
01:26:27,881 --> 01:26:28,870
What time is it?

986
01:26:29,883 --> 01:26:30,872
It's 4:15.

987
01:26:32,219 --> 01:26:33,049
I'll find a cab.

988
01:26:33,554 --> 01:26:34,885
Something must have happened.

989
01:26:37,057 --> 01:26:37,887
Taxi!

990
01:26:43,864 --> 01:26:44,853
Joel, do you like music?

991
01:26:46,033 --> 01:26:47,364
This is beautiful equipment.

992
01:26:49,103 --> 01:26:51,833
What do you say, $300...

993
01:26:51,905 --> 01:26:53,099
...amps and speakers, the works?

994
01:26:53,707 --> 01:26:54,537
It's a bargain, Joel.

995
01:26:54,875 --> 01:26:57,935
You would have to pay twice
as much for it anywhere else.

996
01:26:59,213 --> 01:27:01,613
All right! He likes music!

997
01:27:15,295 --> 01:27:17,786
How 'bout some women's outfits?

998
01:27:17,865 --> 01:27:19,560
You know, somethin' for your mom?

999
01:27:19,967 --> 01:27:21,127
Should fit her okay.

1000
01:27:21,735 --> 01:27:22,394
Yes.

1001
01:27:22,903 --> 01:27:23,562
What?

1002
01:27:24,071 --> 01:27:25,060
Yes, I'll buy it!

1003
01:27:25,406 --> 01:27:26,737
I haven't given you a price yet.

1004
01:27:27,408 --> 01:27:29,069
Can we get through this, please?

1005
01:27:29,410 --> 01:27:30,399
$125.

1006
01:27:35,582 --> 01:27:37,072
That's all, you have everything.

1007
01:27:37,418 --> 01:27:38,407
Wait a minute.

1008
01:27:42,256 --> 01:27:43,245
What about this?

1009
01:27:44,758 --> 01:27:45,588
What is that?

1010
01:27:46,593 --> 01:27:48,584
Some glass, artsy-fartsy thing.

1011
01:27:49,596 --> 01:27:51,257
How much money do you have left, Joel?

1012
01:27:51,932 --> 01:27:52,921
$40.

1013
01:27:54,101 --> 01:27:56,763
I don't think I can sell the
artsy-fartsy thing for $40.

1014
01:27:57,838 --> 01:27:59,999
-What do you think, Vic?
-He's only got $40.

1015
01:28:00,274 --> 01:28:01,832
I only have $40.

1016
01:28:02,176 --> 01:28:05,111
I'll sell it to you for $340.

1017
01:28:05,779 --> 01:28:07,940
I'll spot you the $300.

1018
01:28:08,015 --> 01:28:09,277
You're good for it, right?

1019
01:28:10,284 --> 01:28:10,943
Certainly.

1020
01:28:11,452 --> 01:28:12,350
I think he's good for it.

1021
01:28:12,686 --> 01:28:13,345
Here!

1022
01:28:13,687 --> 01:28:14,449
Catch!

1023
01:28:27,201 --> 01:28:28,190
To Joel!

1024
01:28:28,635 --> 01:28:32,298
Here's wishin' you good luck
on your future as a businessman!

1025
01:28:32,639 --> 01:28:36,131
Because, God knows,
you're going to need it!

1026
01:29:16,350 --> 01:29:17,840
Be careful, you'll break it!

1027
01:29:18,185 --> 01:29:21,677
That's good. Thank you,
thank you, thank you!

1028
01:29:22,356 --> 01:29:26,349
Keep the Chinese pieces together, and
put the Greek pieces on another shelf.

1029
01:29:27,027 --> 01:29:30,019
I don't think you should mix centuries.

1030
01:29:45,879 --> 01:29:48,370
Mom! Dad! You're home!

1031
01:29:50,551 --> 01:29:51,540
Where were you?

1032
01:29:52,219 --> 01:29:53,208
I was here.

1033
01:29:53,554 --> 01:29:55,215
We called from the airport!

1034
01:29:56,056 --> 01:29:58,047
I must have been outside watering.

1035
01:29:58,392 --> 01:30:00,383
I thought you were coming
home tomorrow.

1036
01:30:00,727 --> 01:30:02,388
Sweetheart, I said the 5th.

1037
01:30:03,130 --> 01:30:05,121
No, you said the 6th. I wrote it down.

1038
01:30:05,465 --> 01:30:07,956
I'm sure I told you the 5th.

1039
01:30:08,635 --> 01:30:09,966
Help me bring in the luggage.

1040
01:30:10,304 --> 01:30:11,293
She said the 6th.

1041
01:30:15,642 --> 01:30:16,301
Joel?

1042
01:30:16,743 --> 01:30:17,573
Yes, Mom?

1043
01:30:19,246 --> 01:30:20,577
Can I talk to you for a minute?

1044
01:30:26,086 --> 01:30:27,075
What happened to my egg?

1045
01:30:28,155 --> 01:30:29,144
What do you mean?

1046
01:30:30,324 --> 01:30:31,655
There's a crack in it!

1047
01:30:33,994 --> 01:30:34,983
You're kidding!

1048
01:30:35,662 --> 01:30:37,152
No, Joel, I'm not kidding.

1049
01:30:37,764 --> 01:30:40,096
There's a small crack, inside the egg.

1050
01:30:40,434 --> 01:30:41,332
What's wrong?

1051
01:30:41,668 --> 01:30:42,657
My egg is ruined.

1052
01:30:43,670 --> 01:30:44,602
What happened?

1053
01:30:46,440 --> 01:30:47,429
I don't know.

1054
01:30:47,774 --> 01:30:48,763
You don't know.

1055
01:30:50,777 --> 01:30:52,438
Mom, maybe it was cracked before.

1056
01:30:53,180 --> 01:30:54,670
I don't think so, Joel.

1057
01:30:55,115 --> 01:30:56,776
How could you let this happen?

1058
01:31:00,120 --> 01:31:01,018
I'm sorry.

1059
01:31:01,355 --> 01:31:03,346
This is so damned irresponsible of you!

1060
01:31:03,690 --> 01:31:05,954
We'll get another egg,
and Joel will pay for it.

1061
01:31:07,294 --> 01:31:08,283
Sure, I'll pay for it.

1062
01:31:10,130 --> 01:31:13,793
Where will you get the money
to pay for something like that?

1063
01:31:14,801 --> 01:31:17,201
I'm very disappointed in you.

1064
01:31:24,711 --> 01:31:25,700
Mother will be all right.

1065
01:31:26,146 --> 01:31:28,307
Why don't you put in some yard work?

1066
01:32:28,608 --> 01:32:32,009
Do you have something to tell me?

1067
01:32:34,448 --> 01:32:36,245
No...

1068
01:32:36,316 --> 01:32:37,112
...I don't think so.

1069
01:32:38,618 --> 01:32:41,951
I just received a telephone call
from Bill Rutherford.

1070
01:32:44,725 --> 01:32:48,058
Apparently, you two had
quite a meeting.

1071
01:32:52,466 --> 01:32:54,798
" Princeton can use a guy like Joel. "

1072
01:32:56,903 --> 01:32:57,562
What?

1073
01:32:58,305 --> 01:33:00,796
" Princeton can use a guy like Joel. "

1074
01:33:02,309 --> 01:33:03,401
His exact words!

1075
01:33:05,912 --> 01:33:07,243
That is unbelievable!

1076
01:33:07,581 --> 01:33:09,674
You're as good as in!

1077
01:33:09,750 --> 01:33:11,081
I knew you could do it!

1078
01:33:11,585 --> 01:33:14,247
Haven't I told you before,
sometimes you have to say:

1079
01:33:14,421 --> 01:33:16,412
"What the heck! "
Gotta take some chances.

1080
01:33:16,923 --> 01:33:17,912
You were so right.

1081
01:33:18,592 --> 01:33:19,923
You've made me very proud.

1082
01:33:26,433 --> 01:33:28,094
I was just thinking...

1083
01:33:29,336 --> 01:33:31,668
...where we might be ten years from now.

1084
01:33:34,441 --> 01:33:36,409
You know what I think?

1085
01:33:36,476 --> 01:33:38,444
I think we're both going
to make it big!

1086
01:33:38,945 --> 01:33:42,278
I'm very optimistic! I mean it!

1087
01:33:45,685 --> 01:33:46,674
Can I ask you something?

1088
01:33:52,292 --> 01:33:54,283
Was our night together...

1089
01:33:57,297 --> 01:34:00,061
...just to set up...

1090
01:34:00,133 --> 01:34:01,293
...Vicki and Guido?

1091
01:34:13,814 --> 01:34:15,145
You don't believe me, do you?

1092
01:34:17,984 --> 01:34:20,953
My name is Russell Bitterman.
I'm from Wheaton High School.

1093
01:34:21,054 --> 01:34:25,047
Our product is a paper-towel
holder that sells for $8.95.

1094
01:34:25,826 --> 01:34:29,159
We made a profit of $850 last semester.

1095
01:34:35,402 --> 01:34:36,733
I don't want you to get hurt.

1096
01:34:39,673 --> 01:34:43,837
My name is Evonne Williams.
We sell decorative planters for $7.

1097
01:34:45,078 --> 01:34:47,911
We made a profit
of $500 last semester.

1098
01:34:51,017 --> 01:34:54,009
Guess we won't see
each other for a while.

1099
01:34:54,354 --> 01:34:55,343
I know.

1100
01:34:57,357 --> 01:34:58,756
Are you going straight home now?

1101
01:34:59,092 --> 01:35:00,081
I don't know, why?

1102
01:35:01,027 --> 01:35:04,519
It might be nice if we spent
the evening together.

1103
01:35:05,699 --> 01:35:07,030
I'd really enjoy that.

1104
01:35:08,702 --> 01:35:10,693
How much you got on you?

1105
01:35:12,372 --> 01:35:13,896
How much have I got on me?

1106
01:35:13,974 --> 01:35:15,202
I have $20.

1107
01:35:15,876 --> 01:35:17,036
$20, Lana?

1108
01:35:18,111 --> 01:35:19,772
What are we going to do about this?

1109
01:35:20,380 --> 01:35:23,213
-Can I send it to you?
-Can you send it to me?!

1110
01:35:24,084 --> 01:35:26,018
'Cause I don't have that much here.

1111
01:35:26,086 --> 01:35:27,246
How 'bout I write you a check?

1112
01:35:27,721 --> 01:35:30,884
Do you think I'd accept a check
from you? What am l, stupid?

1113
01:35:32,392 --> 01:35:33,723
I have a bond at the bank.

1114
01:35:35,729 --> 01:35:37,390
My name is Joel Goodson.

1115
01:35:38,398 --> 01:35:40,229
I deal in human fulfillment.

1116
01:35:41,401 --> 01:35:44,734
I grossed over $8,000 in one evening.

1117
01:35:45,739 --> 01:35:47,730
The time of your life, huh kid?
