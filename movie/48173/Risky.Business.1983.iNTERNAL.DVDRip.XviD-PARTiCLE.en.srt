1
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,932
The dream is always the same.

2
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:04,103
Instead of going home,
I go to the neighbors'.

3
00:02:13,783 --> 00:02:15,273
I ring, but nobody answers.

4
00:02:16,853 --> 00:02:19,048
The door is open, so I go inside.

5
00:02:22,358 --> 00:02:25,054
I look around,
but no one seems to be there.

6
00:02:34,204 --> 00:02:35,967
And then, I hear the shower running.

7
00:02:37,207 --> 00:02:39,869
So, I go upstairs to see what's what.

8
00:03:00,997 --> 00:03:01,986
Then I see her.

9
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:05,527
This...girl!

10
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:07,229
This incredible girl!

11
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:12,333
I don't know why she's there
because she doesn't live there.

12
00:03:13,409 --> 00:03:15,172
But this is a dream, so I go with it.

13
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:18,774
"Who's there?" she says.

14
00:03:20,183 --> 00:03:21,172
"Joel," I say.

15
00:03:22,352 --> 00:03:23,376
"What are you doing here?"

16
00:03:24,187 --> 00:03:25,518
" I don't know."

17
00:03:26,389 --> 00:03:27,720
"What are you doing here?"

18
00:03:29,192 --> 00:03:30,921
" I'm taking a shower," she says.

19
00:03:32,428 --> 00:03:34,555
Then I give her...

20
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:35,689
..."Do you want me to go?"

21
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:39,065
"No," she says.

22
00:03:39,135 --> 00:03:40,693
"l want you to wash my back."

23
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:46,372
I'm becoming enthusiastic
about this dream.

24
00:03:48,945 --> 00:03:52,540
So, I go toward her, but she's hard
to find through all the steam.

25
00:03:53,116 --> 00:03:55,175
I keep losing her.

26
00:04:06,663 --> 00:04:07,960
Finally I get to the door...

27
00:04:12,802 --> 00:04:17,466
...and I find myself in a room full
of kids taking their College Boards.

28
00:04:19,175 --> 00:04:20,472
I'm more than three hours late!

29
00:04:21,411 --> 00:04:24,403
I have only two minutes
to complete the entire test.

30
00:04:28,251 --> 00:04:30,412
I've made a terrible mistake.

31
00:04:31,754 --> 00:04:33,949
I'll never get to college.

32
00:04:34,023 --> 00:04:35,422
My life is ruined.

33
00:04:39,495 --> 00:04:44,194
Here's the game; five-card draw
with a spit. Anaconda, high-low.

34
00:04:52,442 --> 00:04:53,272
What happened?

35
00:04:55,845 --> 00:04:56,709
Last night?

36
00:04:57,347 --> 00:04:58,837
That's right, with Kessler.

37
00:05:01,217 --> 00:05:02,775
She was baby-sitting down the street.

38
00:05:03,119 --> 00:05:04,108
We know that!

39
00:05:04,854 --> 00:05:05,843
So, I went over there.

40
00:05:08,524 --> 00:05:11,516
She was bathing the baby and
accidentally hit the shower knob.

41
00:05:11,961 --> 00:05:13,952
All of her clothes
were upstairs, drying.

42
00:05:18,134 --> 00:05:20,796
So she plops down...

43
00:05:22,372 --> 00:05:23,964
...she looks up at me and says...

44
00:05:24,374 --> 00:05:27,309
..."l think I'm in the mood."

45
00:05:28,177 --> 00:05:29,166
She said that?

46
00:05:31,314 --> 00:05:32,303
What did you say?!

47
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:35,811
I didn't have to say anything.

48
00:05:36,152 --> 00:05:37,483
What did you do?

49
00:05:38,888 --> 00:05:40,253
What do you think I did?

50
00:05:41,157 --> 00:05:44,490
I think you got the hell out of there,
ran home and whacked off!

51
00:05:48,398 --> 00:05:50,889
I disagree.

52
00:05:50,967 --> 00:05:52,264
Did you have your bike with you?

53
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:58,071
I think you jumped on your bike,
pedaled home and whacked off!

54
00:06:01,177 --> 00:06:03,168
That's what you think, right?

55
00:06:03,579 --> 00:06:08,278
With Kessler sitting on the floor
like that, wanting me?

56
00:06:13,689 --> 00:06:14,678
No guts, Goodson.

57
00:06:15,425 --> 00:06:18,087
I know, but the problem was,
I wasn't attracted to her.

58
00:06:18,361 --> 00:06:19,658
Should never stop you.

59
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:20,922
She seemed too big.

60
00:06:21,297 --> 00:06:22,594
It could have worked out.

61
00:06:23,533 --> 00:06:25,091
I thought I'd get into trouble.

62
00:06:25,435 --> 00:06:29,098
Sometimes you have to say,
"What the fuck! " Make your move!

63
00:06:31,374 --> 00:06:32,705
That's easy for you to say.

64
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:37,439
You're all set.
You're probably going to Harvard.

65
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:42,546
Me, I don't want to make a mistake,
jeopardize my future!

66
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,051
Joel, let me tell you something.

67
00:06:49,725 --> 00:06:52,626
Every now and then, say,
"What the fuck."

68
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:56,723
"What the fuck," gives you freedom.

69
00:06:57,967 --> 00:06:59,958
Freedom brings opportunity.

70
00:07:01,137 --> 00:07:04,470
Opportunity makes your future.

71
00:07:07,009 --> 00:07:08,772
Be right there.

72
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:16,413
So, your folks are going out of town?

73
00:07:18,988 --> 00:07:19,647
Tomorrow.

74
00:07:21,491 --> 00:07:24,153
You'll have the house all to yourself?

75
00:07:26,596 --> 00:07:27,255
Yeah.

76
00:07:28,498 --> 00:07:29,487
"What the fuck."

77
00:07:35,938 --> 00:07:37,997
If you can't say it...

78
00:07:38,074 --> 00:07:38,938
...you can't do it.

79
00:07:49,785 --> 00:07:52,185
Joel, did you receive
your SAT results?

80
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:56,688
How did you do?

81
00:07:57,527 --> 00:08:00,360
597 Math, 560 Verbal.

82
00:08:01,964 --> 00:08:04,296
If you wanted,
you could take the tests again?

83
00:08:04,534 --> 00:08:05,728
-I guess so.
-Great.

84
00:08:06,202 --> 00:08:08,193
Joel, I want to show you something.

85
00:08:09,138 --> 00:08:10,537
Honey, did you pack my Mace?

86
00:08:10,706 --> 00:08:12,537
Yes, in your cosmetic case.

87
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:20,405
Joel, do you hear something odd?

88
00:08:20,483 --> 00:08:21,541
Something unpleasant?

89
00:08:22,151 --> 00:08:22,810
No.

90
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:26,218
A preponderance of bass, perhaps?

91
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:28,583
No.

92
00:08:29,225 --> 00:08:30,920
Is this the way I left the equalizer?

93
00:08:31,661 --> 00:08:32,320
No.

94
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:36,558
This is not a toy for you
and your friends.

95
00:08:39,235 --> 00:08:42,227
If you can't use it properly,
you're not to use it at all.

96
00:08:45,341 --> 00:08:47,002
My house, my rules.

97
00:08:52,248 --> 00:08:53,943
Joel, I spoke to Bill Rutherford.

98
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:56,445
He interviews for Princeton.

99
00:08:56,686 --> 00:08:58,017
I'll never get into Princeton!

100
00:08:58,354 --> 00:09:00,015
I already arranged an interview.

101
00:09:00,356 --> 00:09:02,688
Friday night, the 4th, at our house.

102
00:09:03,025 --> 00:09:04,356
Oh, Jesus, Dad!

103
00:09:05,261 --> 00:09:08,526
Tell him about your involvement with
Future Enterprisers.

104
00:09:08,598 --> 00:09:10,088
They like that.

105
00:09:12,768 --> 00:09:14,963
There's $50 for food,
which is more than you'll need.

106
00:09:15,271 --> 00:09:18,263
An extra $50 for emergencies
and $25, just in case.

107
00:09:18,608 --> 00:09:21,600
Don't forget to water
the plants on the patio.

108
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:23,969
I made a list,
it's on the refrigerator door.

109
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:25,611
Dad, should I start your car?

110
00:09:25,982 --> 00:09:26,971
The car will be fine, Joel.

111
00:09:27,283 --> 00:09:28,215
For the battery, I mean--

112
00:09:28,551 --> 00:09:31,384
Please, you are not to use my car.
You're not insured to drive it.

113
00:09:31,487 --> 00:09:33,011
-Use the station wagon.
-Use my car, honey.

114
00:09:35,458 --> 00:09:36,948
Do we understand each other?

115
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:38,390
Okay!

116
00:09:40,129 --> 00:09:43,565
And concerning the house, darling, just
use your best judgment.

117
00:09:43,733 --> 00:09:45,132
We trust you.

118
00:09:45,301 --> 00:09:46,290
Have a good time.

119
00:09:47,503 --> 00:09:48,299
Be good.

120
00:09:48,638 --> 00:09:50,003
We will, honey. Bye.

121
00:10:44,193 --> 00:10:47,560
"Just take those old records
off the shelf

122
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:51,056
" I sit and listen to them by myself

123
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:55,060
"Today's music ain't got the same soul

124
00:10:55,705 --> 00:10:58,697
"l like that old time rock and roll!

125
00:10:59,709 --> 00:11:02,371
" Don't try to take me to a disco

126
00:11:03,379 --> 00:11:06,371
"You'll never even get me
out on the floor

127
00:11:07,383 --> 00:11:10,147
" In ten minutes I'll
be late for the door

128
00:11:10,986 --> 00:11:14,319
" I like that old time rock and roll!

129
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:17,891
"Still like that old time rock and roll!

130
00:11:19,161 --> 00:11:21,823
"That kind of music
just soothes the soul

131
00:11:22,832 --> 00:11:26,165
"l reminisce about the days of old

132
00:11:26,736 --> 00:11:29,728
"And that old time rock and roll!"

133
00:11:52,661 --> 00:11:53,650
Guess what?

134
00:11:53,896 --> 00:11:55,591
Dalby got into Harvard.

135
00:11:57,032 --> 00:11:58,431
He must have aced his boards.

136
00:11:58,768 --> 00:11:59,860
780, Verbal.

137
00:12:00,369 --> 00:12:01,700
765, Math!

138
00:12:02,037 --> 00:12:02,696
Shit!

139
00:12:03,038 --> 00:12:05,632
Do you know how much money
a Harvard MBA earns, first year?

140
00:12:05,775 --> 00:12:06,639
$40,000.

141
00:12:06,942 --> 00:12:10,639
I have a cousin who is a dermatologist.
First year, over $60,000!

142
00:12:10,946 --> 00:12:12,277
Just for squeezing zits?

143
00:12:13,449 --> 00:12:16,441
Why don't you try it, Barry?
You have the experience.

144
00:12:18,053 --> 00:12:19,452
Thank you, you're very kind.

145
00:12:19,789 --> 00:12:20,881
Hey, listen, you guys.

146
00:12:21,791 --> 00:12:23,952
Doesn't anyone want
to accomplish anything?

147
00:12:24,293 --> 00:12:25,658
Or do we just want to make money?

148
00:12:27,229 --> 00:12:28,161
Make money.

149
00:12:28,798 --> 00:12:29,787
Just make money.

150
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:31,963
Make a lot of money.

151
00:12:32,568 --> 00:12:33,557
What about you, Joel?

152
00:12:36,405 --> 00:12:38,396
Serve my fellow mankind.

153
00:12:44,814 --> 00:12:46,179
Profit motive.

154
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:49,581
Competition.

155
00:12:51,086 --> 00:12:52,417
Free enterprise.

156
00:12:53,489 --> 00:12:56,185
Is there any company that doesn't
have a product in production?

157
00:12:56,826 --> 00:12:58,259
We're falling far behind.

158
00:12:58,494 --> 00:12:59,688
You haven't exactly been helping.

159
00:12:59,995 --> 00:13:01,462
You wanted to be
the production executive.

160
00:13:01,597 --> 00:13:05,192
Bullshit! Every sales manager I know
helps with the production.

161
00:13:05,367 --> 00:13:06,095
Really? Who?

162
00:13:06,502 --> 00:13:07,992
Just help me with the production!

163
00:13:08,337 --> 00:13:10,498
No! I'm too busy with
marketing and sales!

164
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,501
How can you be busy with
marketing and sales?

165
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:14,005
I haven't given you a product yet.

166
00:13:15,277 --> 00:13:17,438
Barry, just bring the goddamn thing
over tonight.

167
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:20,772
I only took this class because
I thought it'd look good on my record.

168
00:13:27,623 --> 00:13:28,521
Hey, Glenn. What's up?

169
00:13:29,458 --> 00:13:31,119
I heard your parents were away.

170
00:13:33,462 --> 00:13:34,952
I thought I could borrow a room?

171
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,529
Barry is here, and we're working.

172
00:13:39,969 --> 00:13:41,630
Oh, we won't bother you.

173
00:13:41,971 --> 00:13:42,960
We don't have anywhere to go.

174
00:13:43,806 --> 00:13:44,795
You know how it is.

175
00:13:47,142 --> 00:13:48,473
Okay. Use my bedroom.

176
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:51,213
Thanks, Joel.

177
00:13:58,821 --> 00:14:00,083
The "Memo-Minder! "

178
00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:02,186
Here's how it works.

179
00:14:02,424 --> 00:14:06,758
A call comes in for your Mom which is
fairly important. What do you do?

180
00:14:06,829 --> 00:14:11,493
You write the message on the paper and
flip this switch, activating the light.

181
00:14:12,401 --> 00:14:16,394
Now, a call for your Dad comes in,
and it is extremely important!

182
00:14:16,772 --> 00:14:18,831
You're gonna get your ass kicked in
if he misses it.

183
00:14:19,408 --> 00:14:20,670
So, what do you do?

184
00:14:20,743 --> 00:14:22,335
Write the message down there,
position two.

185
00:14:26,782 --> 00:14:30,343
We invest $1.86 in materials, sell it
for $9.95 and we'll make a fortune!

186
00:14:37,593 --> 00:14:38,787
I can't concentrate with this.

187
00:14:39,094 --> 00:14:40,288
This is really annoying.

188
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:43,295
That is ridiculous!

189
00:14:47,202 --> 00:14:48,191
I'm leaving.

190
00:14:56,312 --> 00:14:58,610
Lock the door when you leave, Glenn.

191
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:04,115
If you read me, grunt twice!

192
00:15:08,624 --> 00:15:09,648
Thank you!

193
00:15:46,261 --> 00:15:48,661
I can't believe Glenn bringing
Statwiler over like that.

194
00:15:48,998 --> 00:15:49,657
Why?

195
00:15:49,999 --> 00:15:52,661
Because he boffed Hendricks last week!

196
00:15:53,002 --> 00:15:53,934
He did?

197
00:15:54,003 --> 00:15:56,665
Yes! And after the game on Saturday,
he fucked her.

198
00:15:58,107 --> 00:15:59,597
-Barry?
-What?

199
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:01,866
Boffing and fucking are the same thing.

200
00:16:03,278 --> 00:16:04,267
They are?

201
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:08,373
Yes. What did you think?

202
00:16:08,684 --> 00:16:10,015
I thought it was something else.

203
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:12,385
You're sure on this?

204
00:16:13,889 --> 00:16:14,878
I'm positive.

205
00:16:18,594 --> 00:16:19,583
Shit!

206
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:31,703
Sublime breasts.

207
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:33,397
They're what kind of breasts?

208
00:16:33,709 --> 00:16:35,040
Sublime! They're sublime!

209
00:16:39,314 --> 00:16:41,976
A couple of boys driving
around in daddy's car.

210
00:16:42,317 --> 00:16:43,648
Do you want to race?

211
00:16:50,325 --> 00:16:51,189
Hit it.

212
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:15,314
Okay. Good.

213
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:19,410
You've done the old man's car bit.
That's a good start.

214
00:17:21,757 --> 00:17:23,952
Now, try this on for size.

215
00:17:25,761 --> 00:17:26,955
"The Leather Castle."

216
00:17:28,363 --> 00:17:31,264
"Chicago's finest
dominants and submissives."

217
00:17:32,267 --> 00:17:36,033
" Fully equipped dungeons.
Beginners welcome."

218
00:17:37,272 --> 00:17:38,261
It sounds great, Miles.

219
00:17:39,041 --> 00:17:40,372
Listen to this!

220
00:17:41,376 --> 00:17:44,868
"My daddy spanked my bare bottom.

221
00:17:45,614 --> 00:17:48,879
"Now he's gone.
Will you take his place?

222
00:17:49,218 --> 00:17:50,207
"Call Misty."

223
00:17:50,719 --> 00:17:54,052
Really, Joel.
You have to respond to this one.

224
00:17:54,289 --> 00:17:55,278
They come to your house!

225
00:17:55,991 --> 00:18:00,485
"Countess Angelique seeks
young submissive with large ankles!"

226
00:18:00,996 --> 00:18:01,985
This is it!

227
00:18:02,297 --> 00:18:06,495
"For a good time in the privacy
of your own home, call Jackie.

228
00:18:06,802 --> 00:18:08,793
"555-4875."

229
00:18:10,072 --> 00:18:13,007
Succinct, to the point,
down to business. What do you say?

230
00:18:17,412 --> 00:18:19,505
Listen, if you want to,
call for yourself.

231
00:18:21,817 --> 00:18:23,307
A good time, Joel!

232
00:18:24,253 --> 00:18:26,517
In the privacy of your own home!

233
00:18:27,156 --> 00:18:28,817
What more could you ask for?

234
00:18:30,325 --> 00:18:32,520
I'll make my own calls, thank you.

235
00:18:33,295 --> 00:18:35,195
Then...

236
00:18:35,264 --> 00:18:35,958
...call!

237
00:18:36,598 --> 00:18:37,587
Forget it!

238
00:18:41,003 --> 00:18:42,265
Forget it!

239
00:18:42,838 --> 00:18:44,635
All right!

240
00:18:44,706 --> 00:18:45,764
I'm calling.

241
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:48,532
You're calling?

242
00:18:49,845 --> 00:18:51,176
Someday you'll thank me for this.

243
00:18:51,613 --> 00:18:52,944
Don't mention me, Miles.

244
00:18:53,682 --> 00:18:55,673
Oh, it's her answering machine.

245
00:18:57,619 --> 00:19:00,611
Hi, Jackie, this is Joel Goodson,
345 Remson, Glencoe.

246
00:19:01,290 --> 00:19:03,952
I'd like to have a good time
in my home tonight. Bye!

247
00:19:10,065 --> 00:19:11,293
That was very cute.

248
00:19:12,701 --> 00:19:14,601
Now, give me the number
so I can call her back.

249
00:19:14,803 --> 00:19:17,067
Number? There isn't any number.

250
00:19:18,373 --> 00:19:20,068
Give me the number, damn it!

251
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:24,568
There is no number.

252
00:19:26,715 --> 00:19:28,080
You're an asshole!

253
00:19:28,717 --> 00:19:30,844
Gotta go.
Catch you later.

254
00:19:35,357 --> 00:19:36,688
Shithead!

255
00:20:44,526 --> 00:20:45,686
Oh God!

256
00:21:02,611 --> 00:21:05,774
Hello, Joel, I'm Jackie. How are you?

257
00:21:08,383 --> 00:21:10,544
Nice to meet you, Jackie.
I'm not Joel.

258
00:21:10,886 --> 00:21:12,911
Joel stepped out for a moment.

259
00:21:14,489 --> 00:21:15,387
I'll go call him.

260
00:21:23,632 --> 00:21:24,530
Holy shit!

261
00:21:28,637 --> 00:21:30,969
Dalby, get your ass over here!

262
00:21:31,306 --> 00:21:32,898
I'm playing cards, Joel!

263
00:21:33,241 --> 00:21:34,230
Just get over here!

264
00:21:34,743 --> 00:21:35,732
Is she there?

265
00:21:36,078 --> 00:21:38,740
Yes, she is here,
and she is waiting for you!

266
00:21:39,147 --> 00:21:41,980
She's not waiting for me,
she's waiting for you.

267
00:21:42,651 --> 00:21:43,640
Are you coming?

268
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:46,481
No! I'm playing cards!

269
00:21:48,323 --> 00:21:49,312
You're not coming?

270
00:21:52,427 --> 00:21:53,485
Get over here, Dalby!

271
00:22:07,843 --> 00:22:10,277
Look, I'm very sorry
about the misunderstanding.

272
00:22:12,447 --> 00:22:14,779
Be a courageous person, Joel.
Open the door!

273
00:22:15,117 --> 00:22:17,449
Then, you see, I can call a cab.

274
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:20,112
Again, I'm very sorry.

275
00:22:20,689 --> 00:22:24,022
If we can agree on an arrangement,
I'm in no mood for complaints.

276
00:22:24,626 --> 00:22:27,322
I mean, when you put
your good money down...

277
00:22:27,396 --> 00:22:30,627
...you gotta get what you went after in
the first place. Know what I'm saying?

278
00:22:30,699 --> 00:22:33,862
When you buy a TV,
you don't buy Sony if you want RCA.

279
00:22:35,137 --> 00:22:37,537
I know you and I could get along
real well. But, hey!

280
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:39,701
It's your hard-earned money,
am I right?

281
00:22:41,209 --> 00:22:44,645
Now, we make an arrangement,
and everyone is satisfied.

282
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:46,038
You paid carfare.

283
00:22:46,381 --> 00:22:49,373
A long drive.
I don't ever come out this far.

284
00:22:50,552 --> 00:22:51,382
And your time.

285
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:54,712
My time, my effort,
my infinite patience and understanding.

286
00:22:55,057 --> 00:22:55,819
Thank you.

287
00:22:56,158 --> 00:22:57,147
$75.

288
00:22:59,161 --> 00:22:59,889
Fair enough.

289
00:23:00,228 --> 00:23:02,662
Joel, I'm going to give you
a telephone number.

290
00:23:03,498 --> 00:23:05,966
Ask for Lana when you call.

291
00:23:06,034 --> 00:23:06,898
She is what you want.

292
00:23:10,238 --> 00:23:12,331
She's what every white boy
off the lake wants.

293
00:23:44,773 --> 00:23:47,435
All right, Goodson,
we know you're in there!

294
00:23:48,043 --> 00:23:49,032
What's that?!

295
00:23:50,378 --> 00:23:51,367
I think someone's out there.

296
00:23:59,054 --> 00:24:03,115
Joel, the house is surrounded.
Do exactly as we say,

297
00:24:03,291 --> 00:24:04,724
and no one will get hurt.

298
00:24:05,827 --> 00:24:06,816
Oh, shit!

299
00:24:06,895 --> 00:24:11,559
Get off the baby-sitter! Put on your
pants, and come out with your hands up!

300
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:20,640
Please, Joel, do as they say!

301
00:24:22,377 --> 00:24:23,401
Get off the baby-sitter!

302
00:24:24,146 --> 00:24:25,579
Don't throw your life away like this.

303
00:24:28,817 --> 00:24:33,481
Listen, you goddamn punk, you'll never
have a future! Not if I can help it!

304
00:24:34,489 --> 00:24:36,480
Did you hear me?! No future!

305
00:24:37,325 --> 00:24:38,656
Who is that?

306
00:24:39,094 --> 00:24:40,152
My father!

307
00:25:37,219 --> 00:25:39,483
Hello? Lana?

308
00:25:40,055 --> 00:25:40,714
Yes?

309
00:25:42,490 --> 00:25:43,149
Hi.

310
00:25:56,605 --> 00:25:59,096
I'm a nice guy,
and I would like to meet you tonight.

311
00:25:59,174 --> 00:26:00,664
Fine. Where are you?

312
00:26:03,845 --> 00:26:04,675
Where do you live?

313
00:26:09,351 --> 00:26:10,010
Glencoe.

314
00:26:11,419 --> 00:26:12,750
What is your name?

315
00:26:18,526 --> 00:26:19,185
Ralph.

316
00:26:20,595 --> 00:26:23,257
Ralph, can I have the address?

317
00:26:30,939 --> 00:26:31,598
345...

318
00:26:32,507 --> 00:26:33,201
...Remson.

319
00:26:34,943 --> 00:26:35,705
Ralph?

320
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:39,869
I'll see you tonight.

321
00:28:21,049 --> 00:28:23,040
Are you ready for me, Ralph?

322
00:30:22,103 --> 00:30:25,436
This is a beautiful place, Ralph.
Is it all yours?

323
00:30:26,107 --> 00:30:27,438
It's my folks' house.

324
00:30:28,776 --> 00:30:30,767
Do you know what it's worth?

325
00:30:33,014 --> 00:30:34,003
A lot, probably.

326
00:30:34,349 --> 00:30:36,010
Oh, yeah! Real estate?

327
00:30:36,351 --> 00:30:37,340
It's fabulous!

328
00:30:38,453 --> 00:30:41,786
Listen, Lana...my name
really isn't Ralph.

329
00:30:45,193 --> 00:30:46,854
It's Joel.

330
00:30:47,862 --> 00:30:50,126
I need $300...Joel.

331
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:53,698
You're kidding?

332
00:30:54,035 --> 00:30:55,366
No, I don't believe I am.

333
00:30:55,703 --> 00:30:57,034
Could I send it to you?

334
00:31:00,375 --> 00:31:02,036
Could you send it to me, Joel?

335
00:31:02,877 --> 00:31:06,369
I just don't have that much money
here in the house.

336
00:31:06,714 --> 00:31:07,874
How much money do you have?

337
00:31:09,484 --> 00:31:12,146
-I have $50.
-$50?

338
00:31:12,453 --> 00:31:14,614
What are we going to do about this?

339
00:31:20,828 --> 00:31:22,489
I have a bond at the bank
that I could cash--

340
00:31:22,564 --> 00:31:24,225
I'm not good at waiting for people.

341
00:31:26,167 --> 00:31:27,156
I'll be quick.

342
00:31:27,902 --> 00:31:29,233
Give it a try.

343
00:32:09,110 --> 00:32:10,099
I'm back!

344
00:32:23,491 --> 00:32:24,480
I'm here for you.

345
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:47,741
How could she? It's so stupid!

346
00:32:48,082 --> 00:32:49,242
Tell your mother it broke!

347
00:32:49,584 --> 00:32:52,917
That egg is worth a lot more than $300!

348
00:32:53,254 --> 00:32:54,243
What are you going to do?

349
00:32:55,590 --> 00:32:57,888
I'm gonna get it back,
is what I'm gonna do.

350
00:32:57,959 --> 00:32:58,755
Are you going to help?

351
00:32:58,793 --> 00:32:59,782
Sure. When?

352
00:33:01,763 --> 00:33:02,752
Right now!

353
00:33:03,097 --> 00:33:05,759
Not right now!
I have a trig mid-term tomorrow!

354
00:33:07,001 --> 00:33:07,968
Hey, Mr. What-the-fuck...

355
00:33:08,469 --> 00:33:10,869
...I mean, what about exploring
the dark side and all that?

356
00:33:10,972 --> 00:33:12,599
Or was that just bullshit?

357
00:33:13,274 --> 00:33:15,572
That was bullshit, Joel.

358
00:33:15,643 --> 00:33:17,941
I'm surprised you listened to me.

359
00:33:25,019 --> 00:33:25,849
Are you coming?

360
00:33:35,129 --> 00:33:37,120
How can you be certain she'll be here?

361
00:33:37,865 --> 00:33:41,460
I called Jackie and she said
to look for Lana here.

362
00:33:43,137 --> 00:33:47,369
Great idea. Where else can
you buy a hot chocolate for $4?

363
00:33:49,143 --> 00:33:49,973
She's here!

364
00:33:53,981 --> 00:33:57,314
The girl in the blue dress
with the beautiful legs.

365
00:33:58,052 --> 00:33:58,882
That's her.

366
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:01,311
She is fantastic looking!

367
00:34:10,898 --> 00:34:12,229
She's looking right at us!

368
00:34:21,576 --> 00:34:23,009
She knows we're here.

369
00:34:33,354 --> 00:34:35,584
That's it?

370
00:34:35,656 --> 00:34:36,520
That's it, Joel?!

371
00:34:40,194 --> 00:34:42,594
I can't believe we came
all the way here for that!

372
00:34:45,266 --> 00:34:46,927
At least she knows
we're on to her, Miles.

373
00:34:47,268 --> 00:34:48,929
Oh, yeah, she must be terrified.

374
00:34:49,370 --> 00:34:51,099
Joel!

375
00:34:54,275 --> 00:34:55,264
Is this your car?

376
00:34:56,611 --> 00:34:57,373
Maybe.

377
00:34:59,547 --> 00:35:00,536
Can we talk a minute?

378
00:35:01,716 --> 00:35:03,616
Okay.

379
00:35:03,684 --> 00:35:04,708
Let's talk!

380
00:35:05,219 --> 00:35:07,551
Okay. In the car, all right?
It's freezing.

381
00:35:19,634 --> 00:35:20,623
Will you do me a favor?

382
00:35:22,470 --> 00:35:24,131
You want me to do you a favor?

383
00:35:24,472 --> 00:35:25,461
I just need a lift.

384
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:27,137
Look, I want my egg back!

385
00:35:30,578 --> 00:35:31,476
Get out of the car!

386
00:35:31,846 --> 00:35:32,835
Joel, better get moving.

387
00:35:33,247 --> 00:35:34,339
I want my egg back!

388
00:35:34,749 --> 00:35:36,580
You got it, all right?
Let's just get driving!

389
00:35:36,684 --> 00:35:37,548
When?

390
00:35:38,085 --> 00:35:38,744
Now!

391
00:35:39,086 --> 00:35:40,075
Open the door!

392
00:35:40,354 --> 00:35:41,252
When do I get it back?

393
00:35:41,589 --> 00:35:42,578
Start driving!

394
00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:44,653
Open the door!
Are you going to open the door?!

395
00:35:45,593 --> 00:35:46,582
Hey, buster!

396
00:35:47,228 --> 00:35:47,887
Oh fuck! Will you just--

397
00:35:48,162 --> 00:35:50,096
-Get off the car!
-Just start driving!

398
00:35:50,264 --> 00:35:51,595
Start driving, now!

399
00:35:53,267 --> 00:35:55,098
Why don't you start the car, Joel?

400
00:35:56,437 --> 00:35:57,597
Fuck! Get out of here!

401
00:35:57,939 --> 00:35:59,930
Start the goddamn car, Joel!

402
00:36:00,274 --> 00:36:01,263
Lana, open the door.

403
00:36:03,945 --> 00:36:05,606
Where are you going? Lana!

404
00:36:05,947 --> 00:36:07,278
Get out, or I'll kill you!

405
00:36:19,126 --> 00:36:20,024
Who was that guy?

406
00:36:20,795 --> 00:36:22,695
My manager.

407
00:36:22,763 --> 00:36:24,458
He acts a little crazy sometimes.

408
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:27,697
This is my friend, Miles.

409
00:36:30,471 --> 00:36:31,802
Do you like excitement, Miles?

410
00:36:32,807 --> 00:36:33,796
Love it.

411
00:36:51,559 --> 00:36:53,550
Okay, where do you want to go?

412
00:36:54,328 --> 00:36:57,661
I don't know, Joel.
I haven't given it a lot of thought.

413
00:36:57,732 --> 00:36:58,756
Tell me this:

414
00:36:59,166 --> 00:37:00,724
Am I going in the right direction?

415
00:37:03,337 --> 00:37:05,066
Oh, shit! Here he comes!

416
00:37:05,439 --> 00:37:06,167
Here who comes?

417
00:37:07,341 --> 00:37:08,330
That manager of yours?

418
00:37:13,014 --> 00:37:13,844
Hey, Guido!

419
00:37:14,582 --> 00:37:17,107
Big man, hey, Guido!

420
00:37:17,184 --> 00:37:18,446
Big man with a gun!

421
00:37:18,853 --> 00:37:19,842
What are you going to do?

422
00:37:20,187 --> 00:37:21,085
Shoot us all? Stupid!

423
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:28,453
This guy Guido...

424
00:37:28,529 --> 00:37:30,190
-...he's a "manager"?
-That's right.

425
00:37:31,565 --> 00:37:32,554
Or a pimp?

426
00:37:32,867 --> 00:37:33,856
Now, that was quick, Joel.

427
00:37:34,035 --> 00:37:37,527
Have you always been this quick,
or is this something new?

428
00:37:37,872 --> 00:37:38,770
I don't believe this!

429
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:41,201
I have a trig. mid-term tomorrow...

430
00:37:41,275 --> 00:37:43,641
...and I'm being chased by Guido,
the killer-pimp!

431
00:38:09,570 --> 00:38:10,229
Miles?

432
00:38:12,073 --> 00:38:13,062
I think I can take him.

433
00:38:13,207 --> 00:38:14,196
What are you talking...?

434
00:38:45,172 --> 00:38:46,833
I'm really not enjoying this.

435
00:39:07,294 --> 00:39:08,192
I think I'm going to throw up.

436
00:39:18,706 --> 00:39:20,697
I think I'm going to throw up
on you, Joel!

437
00:39:43,330 --> 00:39:44,820
Porsche...

438
00:39:44,899 --> 00:39:46,389
...there is no substitute.

439
00:39:49,603 --> 00:39:50,729
Fuck you.

440
00:39:55,309 --> 00:39:57,243
Hi, dear. It's mother.

441
00:39:57,311 --> 00:39:58,642
How are you?

442
00:39:58,679 --> 00:40:01,170
Just checking in, to say hello.
See how you're doing...

443
00:40:01,248 --> 00:40:02,840
...and give you our flight information.

444
00:40:03,918 --> 00:40:06,853
Wait a minute.
I want to write it down.

445
00:40:09,523 --> 00:40:13,755
Saturday, United Airlines,
Flight 162, arriving at 3:30.

446
00:40:14,261 --> 00:40:17,753
That is correct. Is everything fine
with you? Do you have enough money?

447
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:22,192
It never seems to go as far
as you think it will.

448
00:40:24,138 --> 00:40:26,038
Yes, I know.

449
00:40:26,107 --> 00:40:27,472
I'm learning, Mom.

450
00:40:29,610 --> 00:40:30,770
How is Aunt Tudi?

451
00:40:35,649 --> 00:40:37,048
I will.

452
00:40:38,119 --> 00:40:39,552
See you then, bye.

453
00:40:42,056 --> 00:40:43,387
Your folks, huh?

454
00:40:44,725 --> 00:40:46,215
So, how are they?

455
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:47,891
Oh, they're just fine.

456
00:40:48,395 --> 00:40:49,726
And how is Aunt Tudi?

457
00:40:50,064 --> 00:40:52,555
Her hip is much better.
She sends me her love.

458
00:40:58,305 --> 00:40:59,966
You were telling me about Guido.

459
00:41:00,708 --> 00:41:03,006
I quit Guido.

460
00:41:04,578 --> 00:41:05,237
How come?

461
00:41:10,484 --> 00:41:11,473
Guido thought he owned me.

462
00:41:13,754 --> 00:41:14,686
Nobody owns me.

463
00:41:18,993 --> 00:41:22,326
The problem is, I owe him money
for clothes and hospital bills.

464
00:41:22,696 --> 00:41:24,323
You were in the hospital?

465
00:41:25,933 --> 00:41:28,265
I had this...

466
00:41:28,335 --> 00:41:29,597
...pain in my chest.

467
00:41:29,670 --> 00:41:30,762
I thought I had a heart condition.

468
00:41:32,506 --> 00:41:33,495
What was it?

469
00:41:35,276 --> 00:41:36,265
The doctor said nerves.

470
00:41:37,444 --> 00:41:39,776
Nice service.

471
00:41:39,847 --> 00:41:40,506
Reed & Barton.

472
00:41:44,018 --> 00:41:46,509
Thank you for breakfast. It was good.

473
00:41:48,856 --> 00:41:49,948
I'm going to school now.

474
00:41:56,130 --> 00:41:58,064
I have to ask you to leave.

475
00:42:01,802 --> 00:42:02,461
I'm sorry.

476
00:42:04,038 --> 00:42:05,027
You won't let me stay?

477
00:42:06,874 --> 00:42:08,865
No, I have to go to school.

478
00:42:13,380 --> 00:42:15,143
I really am sorry.

479
00:42:19,386 --> 00:42:20,375
No, I'm sorry.

480
00:42:26,260 --> 00:42:27,249
I'll be right back.

481
00:42:31,165 --> 00:42:32,757
You guys go ahead without me.

482
00:42:33,767 --> 00:42:34,756
She is still here?

483
00:42:35,169 --> 00:42:36,158
She won't leave.

484
00:42:40,174 --> 00:42:41,163
She won't leave.

485
00:42:47,014 --> 00:42:49,505
Lana, look...

486
00:42:49,583 --> 00:42:51,676
...I just want my egg back.
I want my house back.

487
00:42:53,587 --> 00:42:54,781
I have a lot of work to do.

488
00:42:57,691 --> 00:42:59,522
Did you have a good time last night?

489
00:43:03,430 --> 00:43:05,694
You mean when we got back here?

490
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:07,792
I think you know what I mean.

491
00:43:15,109 --> 00:43:16,804
I had a great time.

492
00:43:20,214 --> 00:43:22,705
Don't tell me I owe you another $300.

493
00:43:24,818 --> 00:43:26,445
Did I say you owe me anything?

494
00:43:29,456 --> 00:43:30,150
No, you didn't.

495
00:43:30,224 --> 00:43:32,385
I don't remember saying
that you owe me anything.

496
00:43:38,565 --> 00:43:40,556
What about my mother's egg?

497
00:43:41,735 --> 00:43:45,068
You're the one who's going to college,
you figure it out.

498
00:43:49,343 --> 00:43:50,332
How much time do you need?

499
00:43:51,145 --> 00:43:53,841
I need enough time to make
some telephone calls.

500
00:43:54,148 --> 00:43:56,582
I have to figure out how
to get my stuff back.

501
00:43:56,917 --> 00:43:59,579
Guido has probably locked me
out of the apartment by now.

502
00:44:00,587 --> 00:44:01,519
All right!

503
00:44:03,590 --> 00:44:04,750
But will you do me a favor?

504
00:44:05,926 --> 00:44:06,915
Anything, cookie.

505
00:44:09,363 --> 00:44:11,092
Don't steal anything!

506
00:44:13,867 --> 00:44:16,097
If I come back here,
and find anything missing...

507
00:44:17,938 --> 00:44:20,600
...I'm going straight to the police.
I'm not joking!

508
00:44:21,942 --> 00:44:24,103
Joel, go to school.
Go learn something.

509
00:44:39,460 --> 00:44:40,893
Can I see your pass, please!

510
00:44:43,197 --> 00:44:46,530
I'm sure you've all studied
chapters six through eight...

511
00:44:46,967 --> 00:44:49,197
...so here's a little pop quiz
to confirm it.

512
00:44:49,536 --> 00:44:51,197
Will you put your books
on the floor, please?

513
00:45:15,062 --> 00:45:16,051
You didn't tell anyone, did you?

514
00:45:16,430 --> 00:45:17,488
No. Glenn knows.

515
00:45:18,432 --> 00:45:19,592
What about Barry?

516
00:45:19,666 --> 00:45:20,826
He knows, too.

517
00:45:21,235 --> 00:45:22,224
Don't tell anyone else!

518
00:45:23,337 --> 00:45:24,668
I won't! I won't!

519
00:45:34,515 --> 00:45:37,848
Lab reports are to be on my desk
by tomorrow afternoon.

520
00:45:38,852 --> 00:45:40,513
All reports must be typed.

521
00:45:56,537 --> 00:45:58,198
Don't forget,
term papers are due Friday.

522
00:45:58,872 --> 00:46:01,534
They count for 50%
of this semester's grades.

523
00:46:03,777 --> 00:46:04,607
Damn it!

524
00:46:14,555 --> 00:46:15,487
Hey, Miles, what's happening?

525
00:46:15,789 --> 00:46:16,778
I'm waiting for Glenn.

526
00:46:17,624 --> 00:46:18,613
Glenn? Where is he?

527
00:46:18,992 --> 00:46:19,890
Inside.

528
00:46:20,794 --> 00:46:21,783
In the house?!

529
00:46:22,129 --> 00:46:23,118
He wanted to meet her!

530
00:46:25,999 --> 00:46:26,795
What are you doing?

531
00:46:27,134 --> 00:46:27,998
I was inside.

532
00:46:28,235 --> 00:46:29,224
I can see that.

533
00:46:32,539 --> 00:46:34,200
You're home now.

534
00:46:34,575 --> 00:46:35,906
Yeah, I live here, remember?

535
00:46:39,313 --> 00:46:40,007
Glenn?

536
00:46:43,817 --> 00:46:45,808
Tell me you didn't do
anything with her.

537
00:46:46,153 --> 00:46:47,142
Who, Lana?

538
00:46:47,821 --> 00:46:48,515
Yeah, Lana.

539
00:46:49,156 --> 00:46:50,214
Nothing.

540
00:46:50,290 --> 00:46:51,882
I met her.

541
00:46:51,959 --> 00:46:53,017
She's nice.

542
00:46:53,660 --> 00:46:55,025
You're sure you didn't do anything?

543
00:46:56,263 --> 00:46:57,594
Yeah, I swear.

544
00:46:58,031 --> 00:46:59,658
You did it with her, didn't you, Glenn?

545
00:47:00,767 --> 00:47:03,429
I did not do it with her, Joel!

546
00:47:10,177 --> 00:47:11,542
Ask me about Vicki!

547
00:47:12,613 --> 00:47:13,944
Who is Vicki?

548
00:47:14,448 --> 00:47:15,779
Owe you one!

549
00:47:19,786 --> 00:47:22,778
Are you Joel?
Nice place you have here.

550
00:47:24,124 --> 00:47:24,852
Where's Lana?

551
00:47:25,359 --> 00:47:26,121
In the den.

552
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:27,857
I like your friend!

553
00:47:29,696 --> 00:47:31,357
Get out! I'm not kidding!

554
00:47:31,865 --> 00:47:32,854
What's your problem?

555
00:47:35,569 --> 00:47:37,560
Just leave! Please!

556
00:47:38,138 --> 00:47:40,800
Look, we're not ripping
you off or anything.

557
00:47:45,312 --> 00:47:46,301
What is this for?

558
00:47:46,647 --> 00:47:48,979
$50 goes to the house!
You're the house!

559
00:47:51,385 --> 00:47:54,081
I am not the house!

560
00:47:54,821 --> 00:47:56,652
Just leave! I mean it!

561
00:47:58,659 --> 00:47:59,648
He's mad, Vicki.

562
00:48:00,327 --> 00:48:02,158
Already? I just got here!

563
00:48:02,663 --> 00:48:03,823
I think he wants us to go.

564
00:48:04,831 --> 00:48:05,820
Do you want us to go?

565
00:48:10,103 --> 00:48:10,899
Thank you.

566
00:48:37,364 --> 00:48:39,025
I don't want any problems.

567
00:48:39,366 --> 00:48:41,300
Do you know what
you did to me last night?

568
00:48:41,368 --> 00:48:42,357
I don't care!

569
00:48:45,372 --> 00:48:47,863
I don't want to see you
or do anything with you anymore.

570
00:48:47,941 --> 00:48:48,930
Get in the car!

571
00:49:12,799 --> 00:49:13,788
Excuse me.

572
00:49:15,469 --> 00:49:16,458
What can I do for you?

573
00:49:17,671 --> 00:49:18,660
Who are you?

574
00:49:25,178 --> 00:49:27,169
Are you the kid I chased last night?

575
00:49:29,316 --> 00:49:31,307
Is there something I can help you with?

576
00:49:32,319 --> 00:49:34,253
You shouldn't drive like that.

577
00:49:34,321 --> 00:49:36,983
People get hurt all the time.

578
00:49:37,758 --> 00:49:40,454
Are you a smart kid?

579
00:49:40,527 --> 00:49:41,824
You look like a smart kid.

580
00:49:42,562 --> 00:49:43,893
I'm okay.

581
00:49:43,930 --> 00:49:45,261
Where are the girls? Inside?

582
00:49:48,435 --> 00:49:51,097
I'm sorry, but I'll have
to ask you to leave.

583
00:49:56,009 --> 00:49:58,000
The door is locked.

584
00:49:58,712 --> 00:50:00,339
You're starting to give me
a stomachache.

585
00:50:00,714 --> 00:50:02,011
Good! I hope it hurts!

586
00:50:03,617 --> 00:50:04,606
Are you going to open the door?

587
00:50:05,118 --> 00:50:07,450
Guido, go home!
We don't need you anymore!

588
00:50:07,788 --> 00:50:08,777
Shut your mouth!

589
00:50:09,790 --> 00:50:12,122
Listen, maybe we don't
work for you anymore!

590
00:50:14,227 --> 00:50:15,285
Then who do you work for?

591
00:50:15,629 --> 00:50:16,960
Who? If you aren't working for me?

592
00:50:18,298 --> 00:50:19,731
Maybe we work for Joel, now.

593
00:50:22,135 --> 00:50:23,124
She's only kidding.

594
00:50:24,137 --> 00:50:25,126
I hope so.

595
00:50:27,474 --> 00:50:30,136
Joel, you look like a smart kid.

596
00:50:31,545 --> 00:50:34,480
I'm going to tell you something
I'm sure you'll understand.

597
00:50:35,882 --> 00:50:37,873
You're having fun now, right?

598
00:50:38,885 --> 00:50:41,149
Right, Joel? The time of your life.

599
00:50:43,056 --> 00:50:47,755
In a sluggish economy, never, ever
fuck with another man's livelihood!

600
00:50:49,496 --> 00:50:53,262
If you're smart, like I hope you are...

601
00:50:55,502 --> 00:50:57,766
...you aren't going to make me
come back here.

602
00:51:06,847 --> 00:51:07,677
Thank you, Joel.

603
00:51:11,518 --> 00:51:12,416
This is very decent of you.

604
00:51:13,019 --> 00:51:14,680
Just as long as we understand
each other.

605
00:51:15,856 --> 00:51:18,848
One night, then you find
another place to stay.

606
00:51:19,192 --> 00:51:21,592
As soon as we get in touch with Tandy,
we'll have a place.

607
00:51:21,661 --> 00:51:23,993
-Did you try her again?
-She's still out.

608
00:51:24,598 --> 00:51:25,929
And my mother's egg?

609
00:51:26,700 --> 00:51:28,691
If I can get my stuff back,
I can get the egg.

610
00:51:30,537 --> 00:51:31,526
Then you'll leave?

611
00:51:31,938 --> 00:51:33,303
Then we'll leave.

612
00:51:34,541 --> 00:51:37,533
Oh, I don't know, Lana.
He has such nice friends.

613
00:51:37,878 --> 00:51:39,539
Clean, polite, quick.

614
00:51:40,714 --> 00:51:42,306
I think there's a future here.

615
00:52:01,635 --> 00:52:02,624
What are you studying?

616
00:52:04,571 --> 00:52:06,903
It's a workshop...

617
00:52:06,973 --> 00:52:08,065
...on free enterprise.

618
00:52:14,848 --> 00:52:18,841
We make a product,
and then we try to market it.

619
00:52:20,987 --> 00:52:22,648
Do you make a lot of money?

620
00:52:23,757 --> 00:52:24,746
No. Not really.

621
00:52:28,862 --> 00:52:29,920
No, but we...

622
00:52:31,331 --> 00:52:33,492
...get to compete with other
student companies.

623
00:52:33,934 --> 00:52:35,265
Actually, it's fucked!

624
00:52:36,570 --> 00:52:38,162
I'm just kidding.

625
00:52:39,372 --> 00:52:41,237
It's really quite competitive.

626
00:52:45,679 --> 00:52:47,010
Do you ever get high, Joel?

627
00:52:49,449 --> 00:52:50,780
Yeah. All the time.

628
00:52:51,685 --> 00:52:54,779
You see, Vicki and I were
thinking about getting high.

629
00:52:55,956 --> 00:52:59,289
Maybe going out and
getting some ice cream?

630
00:53:01,461 --> 00:53:02,450
You want to come?

631
00:53:08,368 --> 00:53:10,768
I could go for some
ice cream right now.

632
00:53:23,416 --> 00:53:24,405
Are you stoned?

633
00:53:25,151 --> 00:53:27,142
No. I do not believe so.

634
00:53:29,422 --> 00:53:30,912
I think you're really wasted!

635
00:53:32,325 --> 00:53:34,725
This is not wasted, Barry.

636
00:53:34,794 --> 00:53:36,318
This is definitely not wasted.

637
00:53:41,735 --> 00:53:42,429
Barry?

638
00:53:46,506 --> 00:53:48,838
-I'm a little wasted!
-I know.

639
00:53:52,078 --> 00:53:54,774
-Don't let me do anything stupid.
-Don't worry.

640
00:53:58,752 --> 00:53:59,741
Want to take a walk?

641
00:54:07,260 --> 00:54:08,318
Do you like living at home?

642
00:54:11,598 --> 00:54:13,190
It's all right.

643
00:54:13,266 --> 00:54:14,756
I'll be out next year.

644
00:54:15,101 --> 00:54:16,432
I'll bet your folks are nice people.

645
00:54:17,837 --> 00:54:19,498
And they won't be home till Sunday?

646
00:54:20,273 --> 00:54:20,932
Yeah.

647
00:54:22,442 --> 00:54:24,808
Because, I was thinking.

648
00:54:24,878 --> 00:54:26,539
I mean, after your friend came over...

649
00:54:26,613 --> 00:54:27,602
...I couldn't believe it!

650
00:54:28,515 --> 00:54:30,506
A kid our age walks in with a $100!

651
00:54:31,952 --> 00:54:32,680
Glenn.

652
00:54:33,687 --> 00:54:35,678
Where did he get that kind of change?

653
00:54:36,289 --> 00:54:37,187
I don't know.

654
00:54:38,692 --> 00:54:40,683
He said he cashed a bond.

655
00:54:42,028 --> 00:54:43,518
You people have a lot of bonds.

656
00:54:47,701 --> 00:54:49,032
So, I was thinking....

657
00:54:51,204 --> 00:54:54,196
If we could ever bring our friends
together, we'd make a fortune!

658
00:54:55,809 --> 00:54:56,969
Yeah. You're right.

659
00:54:58,979 --> 00:54:59,968
Do you want to do it?

660
00:55:01,047 --> 00:55:01,706
Do what?

661
00:55:02,048 --> 00:55:04,039
Get our friends together
in the next few days.

662
00:55:06,820 --> 00:55:08,811
No. I don't think so.

663
00:55:10,991 --> 00:55:13,983
Make some money.
Be a little enterpriser.

664
00:55:14,327 --> 00:55:15,225
Future enterpriser.

665
00:55:17,564 --> 00:55:18,895
Be whatever you want to be.

666
00:55:25,505 --> 00:55:28,906
What if I agreed to be
your girlfriend the next few nights?

667
00:55:30,010 --> 00:55:30,840
No charge?

668
00:55:33,680 --> 00:55:36,012
Hey, I'm not trying to force
this idea on you.

669
00:55:37,183 --> 00:55:39,549
It's just that my mind keeps working
all the time.

670
00:55:39,953 --> 00:55:43,445
Nothing I can do about it.
It keeps working and working.

671
00:55:56,970 --> 00:55:57,959
You warm enough?

672
00:55:58,538 --> 00:55:59,527
I'm okay.

673
00:56:06,112 --> 00:56:07,943
Why did you leave home?

674
00:56:09,883 --> 00:56:10,542
Why?

675
00:56:12,118 --> 00:56:13,449
I'm just curious.

676
00:56:17,390 --> 00:56:20,382
Because my step-father
kept coming on to me.

677
00:56:23,229 --> 00:56:24,890
What else do you want to know?

678
00:56:29,402 --> 00:56:31,393
Do you have any brothers and sisters?

679
00:56:33,239 --> 00:56:35,332
I have a brother.

680
00:56:35,408 --> 00:56:36,466
What else?

681
00:56:37,744 --> 00:56:39,075
If you don't want to talk....

682
00:56:39,412 --> 00:56:40,401
No, No. Ask me anything.

683
00:56:40,747 --> 00:56:42,738
I don't think you want
to talk and that's okay.

684
00:56:43,083 --> 00:56:44,744
No, I really want to talk to you.

685
00:56:48,588 --> 00:56:49,577
What does he do?

686
00:56:50,924 --> 00:56:51,913
He goes to school.

687
00:56:54,994 --> 00:56:56,325
Why aren't you going to school?

688
00:56:57,430 --> 00:56:58,419
I'm not my brother.

689
00:57:05,705 --> 00:57:08,037
I'm really trying to be
friends with you.

690
00:57:08,274 --> 00:57:11,266
But I'd appreciate it if you'd
stop trying to judge me...

691
00:57:11,611 --> 00:57:14,603
...while you're leaning on your
daddy's $40,000 car.

692
00:57:18,852 --> 00:57:19,841
I'll see you around.

693
00:57:27,293 --> 00:57:28,624
Was it something I said?

694
00:57:35,702 --> 00:57:39,297
You locked the door!
The keys are inside the car!

695
00:57:39,706 --> 00:57:42,368
Please! Stop! Stop! Stop!

696
00:57:58,658 --> 00:58:00,649
Please stop! Please stop!

697
00:58:33,193 --> 00:58:34,683
Oh, thank you.

698
00:58:34,761 --> 00:58:35,693
Thank you.

699
00:59:19,072 --> 00:59:20,733
All right, everyone watch your feet!

700
00:59:39,158 --> 00:59:40,147
Are you okay?

701
00:59:43,596 --> 00:59:44,585
Do you want an aspirin?

702
00:59:49,435 --> 00:59:50,766
Does your dad own a gun?

703
00:59:55,608 --> 00:59:57,098
Who's the U-boat commander?

704
01:00:11,958 --> 01:00:15,951
You're right. You are absolutely
right to respond this way.

705
01:00:16,796 --> 01:00:18,457
I did not have a doctor's appointment.

706
01:00:19,032 --> 01:00:20,522
But I will tell you
exactly what happened.

707
01:00:22,135 --> 01:00:23,693
" Unexcused." You see, Nurse Bolan...

708
01:00:23,803 --> 01:00:26,795
...If you write "unexcused,"
I fail two mid-terms.

709
01:00:26,973 --> 01:00:29,305
It will ruin my whole
grade point average!

710
01:00:30,476 --> 01:00:35,140
If you'll just stop and listen to me,
I'll explain everything.

711
01:00:40,219 --> 01:00:43,711
The truth is, my parents are away,
and I met this girl.

712
01:00:45,658 --> 01:00:48,320
A call girl, actually.
She came to my house.

713
01:00:50,163 --> 01:00:51,926
Look, you're writing again!

714
01:00:51,998 --> 01:00:53,158
This is not " unexcused"!

715
01:00:55,001 --> 01:00:58,334
If you will just listen to me,
then you'll understand, Nurse Bolan.

716
01:01:00,506 --> 01:01:02,167
Why? Why won't you listen to me?

717
01:01:02,508 --> 01:01:03,839
I had a doctor's appointment.

718
01:01:09,015 --> 01:01:10,004
Excuse me.

719
01:01:11,017 --> 01:01:14,350
It wasn't the girl,
it was my father's car.

720
01:01:14,687 --> 01:01:16,655
I put my father's car
into Lake Michigan...

721
01:01:16,723 --> 01:01:18,691
...and I had to get it fixed.

722
01:01:21,194 --> 01:01:22,525
Just give me a break.

723
01:01:27,700 --> 01:01:28,689
Let me say it another way.

724
01:01:29,702 --> 01:01:34,366
I have spent the last four years of my
life busting my butt in this shithole!

725
01:01:37,877 --> 01:01:38,866
I'm sorry.

726
01:01:39,212 --> 01:01:43,876
I don't think I can leave until I get
just a little compassion from you.

727
01:01:49,889 --> 01:01:50,719
What did he get?

728
01:01:51,290 --> 01:01:54,225
Suspension, five days.

729
01:01:54,293 --> 01:01:56,090
They kicked him out of
Future Enterprisers, too.

730
01:01:56,162 --> 01:01:58,153
Shit! They ruined his whole record!

731
01:01:58,398 --> 01:02:00,059
What's he going to do about the car?

732
01:02:04,404 --> 01:02:05,393
Are you all right, Joel?

733
01:02:07,907 --> 01:02:08,737
I'm all right.

734
01:02:19,819 --> 01:02:20,808
I need a bike.

735
01:02:21,687 --> 01:02:22,551
He needs a bike.

736
01:02:22,755 --> 01:02:24,746
-Glenn, can I borrow your bike?!
-Jesus, Glenn!

737
01:02:25,425 --> 01:02:26,414
Sure. Here, use mine.

738
01:04:57,476 --> 01:04:59,467
It was great the way her mind worked.

739
01:04:59,979 --> 01:05:01,970
No guilt, no doubts, no fear.

740
01:05:02,915 --> 01:05:04,246
None of my specialties.

741
01:05:08,421 --> 01:05:12,084
Just this shameless pursuit of
immediate material gratification.

742
01:05:13,426 --> 01:05:14,757
What a capitalist!

743
01:05:18,264 --> 01:05:21,597
She told me I could earn more money
in one night than I'd make all year.

744
01:05:22,335 --> 01:05:24,098
Enough to pay for my father's car.

745
01:05:24,937 --> 01:05:26,928
She told me she'd be my girlfriend.

746
01:05:30,343 --> 01:05:32,402
She told me a lot of things.

747
01:05:32,478 --> 01:05:33,445
I believed them all.

748
01:05:34,947 --> 01:05:36,608
So, she introduced me to her friends.

749
01:05:42,955 --> 01:05:44,616
" Now when I was a young boy

750
01:05:46,692 --> 01:05:48,182
"At the age of five

751
01:05:50,029 --> 01:05:52,020
"My Mother said I was going to be

752
01:05:53,366 --> 01:05:54,958
"The greatest man alive

753
01:05:56,702 --> 01:05:58,294
" But now I'm a man

754
01:06:00,306 --> 01:06:01,864
"Way past twenty-one

755
01:06:03,542 --> 01:06:05,134
" I want you to believe me, baby

756
01:06:06,879 --> 01:06:08,471
" I have lots of fun

757
01:06:10,383 --> 01:06:11,543
" I'm a Man"

758
01:06:14,654 --> 01:06:16,315
I introduced her to my friends.

759
01:06:24,397 --> 01:06:26,388
We made Barry our treasurer.

760
01:06:29,568 --> 01:06:30,899
Lana did production.

761
01:06:32,238 --> 01:06:34,570
I concentrated on sales.

762
01:06:35,341 --> 01:06:37,502
So, you took her out to dinner twice.

763
01:06:38,010 --> 01:06:38,999
How much did that cost you?

764
01:06:40,246 --> 01:06:41,076
About $30.

765
01:06:41,414 --> 01:06:42,073
With tip?

766
01:06:42,682 --> 01:06:44,013
Okay, maybe $35.

767
01:06:44,517 --> 01:06:46,007
Did you take her to any movies?

768
01:06:46,352 --> 01:06:47,250
Three movies.

769
01:06:47,753 --> 01:06:49,084
$20.

770
01:06:50,022 --> 01:06:50,750
Parking?

771
01:06:51,090 --> 01:06:52,079
I park on the street.

772
01:06:52,925 --> 01:06:53,687
Gas?

773
01:06:55,428 --> 01:06:56,690
Maybe $6.

774
01:06:59,031 --> 01:07:02,364
All right, Stan,
you've paid out approximately $60.

775
01:07:08,641 --> 01:07:09,801
What happened?

776
01:07:11,444 --> 01:07:12,775
She slept with Jacobsen.

777
01:07:17,383 --> 01:07:18,372
That's all I'm saying.

778
01:07:21,387 --> 01:07:23,048
" I can make love to you, woman

779
01:07:24,557 --> 01:07:26,218
" In five minutes' time

780
01:07:27,793 --> 01:07:29,124
"Ain't that a man?"

781
01:07:35,901 --> 01:07:37,892
Do you know what he said? Afterwards?

782
01:07:39,905 --> 01:07:42,601
He said the lady had knowledge.

783
01:07:42,675 --> 01:07:44,404
And he was glad to get that knowledge.

784
01:07:45,311 --> 01:07:46,141
Do you know why?

785
01:07:47,079 --> 01:07:47,738
Why?

786
01:07:48,581 --> 01:07:52,517
Because college girls
can smell ignorance...

787
01:07:52,585 --> 01:07:53,745
...Iike dog shit.

788
01:07:54,487 --> 01:07:55,419
I'll think about it.

789
01:07:56,922 --> 01:07:58,355
Where are you going
to school next year?

790
01:07:58,424 --> 01:07:59,254
Wisconsin.

791
01:07:59,925 --> 01:08:02,587
Wisconsin?

792
01:08:02,661 --> 01:08:03,593
Big school.

793
01:08:23,449 --> 01:08:26,543
All I'm telling you is...

794
01:08:26,619 --> 01:08:27,779
...walk like a man.

795
01:08:56,315 --> 01:08:58,977
Joel! This is a great party!

796
01:09:00,386 --> 01:09:01,717
Are you having a good time?

797
01:09:10,563 --> 01:09:12,997
Excellent idea, Joel!
Really excellent.

798
01:09:19,572 --> 01:09:21,904
Some of the girls are wearing
my mother's clothing.

799
01:09:22,341 --> 01:09:23,330
What's wrong with that?

800
01:09:23,676 --> 01:09:25,803
I don't want to spend the rest
of my life in analysis.

801
01:09:25,878 --> 01:09:26,867
Just talk to them, okay?

802
01:09:27,179 --> 01:09:28,168
All right.

803
01:10:13,058 --> 01:10:14,389
Is Howie Rifkin here?

804
01:10:14,994 --> 01:10:16,325
You're on, honey.

805
01:10:39,351 --> 01:10:42,013
Joel! Somebody is at
the front door for you.

806
01:10:42,354 --> 01:10:44,015
All right, thank you.
I'll be right there.

807
01:10:46,091 --> 01:10:48,685
The thing is...

808
01:10:49,094 --> 01:10:50,755
...I don't have to pay for it.

809
01:10:53,699 --> 01:10:54,688
I get it anyway.

810
01:11:00,706 --> 01:11:03,038
I'd better get going.
I'll miss the party.

811
01:11:08,714 --> 01:11:11,046
Whatever you want to do....

812
01:11:25,064 --> 01:11:27,055
Excuse me? Can I help you?

813
01:11:27,566 --> 01:11:28,396
Are you Joel?

814
01:11:29,468 --> 01:11:30,298
Yes.

815
01:11:30,469 --> 01:11:32,130
Bill Rutherford, Princeton Admissions.

816
01:11:32,404 --> 01:11:34,235
I believe we have
an interview scheduled.

817
01:11:35,407 --> 01:11:37,136
If this is inconvenient for you--

818
01:11:37,476 --> 01:11:38,807
No, sir. It's fine.

819
01:11:49,254 --> 01:11:50,915
Excuse me, can I use the room?

820
01:11:54,593 --> 01:11:57,323
Also, would you answer the phone
if anyone calls, please.

821
01:11:57,763 --> 01:12:00,755
I understand that you would like
to attend Princeton.

822
01:12:01,934 --> 01:12:03,925
Yes, sir, very much.

823
01:12:04,069 --> 01:12:06,094
Well, fine.

824
01:12:06,171 --> 01:12:08,230
Let's take a look at what we have,
shall we?

825
01:12:22,855 --> 01:12:23,844
Does this couch open?

826
01:12:25,190 --> 01:12:26,179
Lana, I'm in a meeting.

827
01:12:26,692 --> 01:12:27,681
We need the room.

828
01:12:28,794 --> 01:12:30,455
Yeah. I need a few minutes, okay?

829
01:12:36,869 --> 01:12:39,201
Now, you've taken
your SATs already.

830
01:12:39,538 --> 01:12:44,202
Math, 597. Verbal, 560. Correct me
if my information is inaccurate.

831
01:12:45,310 --> 01:12:48,302
Well, yes, but I was planning
on taking those tests again.

832
01:12:48,647 --> 01:12:52,481
Fine. Now, your grade
point average is 3.14.

833
01:12:52,818 --> 01:12:54,308
You rank 52 in your class.

834
01:12:54,887 --> 01:12:57,720
That places you in the 84th percentile.
Is that correct?

835
01:12:59,158 --> 01:13:01,820
Joel, this is my cousin,
Ruben, from Skokie.

836
01:13:02,161 --> 01:13:03,150
Can you get him in tonight?

837
01:13:03,529 --> 01:13:04,860
Not now, okay?

838
01:13:04,997 --> 01:13:07,830
-He has to be home by 12:00.
-All right, later guys.

839
01:13:13,806 --> 01:13:14,795
Excuse me.

840
01:13:17,176 --> 01:13:19,007
And you wish to major in?

841
01:13:21,680 --> 01:13:22,339
Business.

842
01:13:23,749 --> 01:13:25,740
Business. Yes.

843
01:13:30,255 --> 01:13:31,586
I'll be out in a second.

844
01:13:36,695 --> 01:13:39,095
Fine, well, let us review
your other activities.

845
01:13:39,865 --> 01:13:44,199
"Junior Varsity Tennis Team.
Recording Secretary, Spanish Club.

846
01:13:46,205 --> 01:13:48,503
"Varsity Tract Team, one year.

847
01:13:48,574 --> 01:13:50,872
" Honorable Mention,
Cook County Science Fair.

848
01:13:52,878 --> 01:13:56,211
" Future Enterprisers.
Yearbook Staff.

849
01:13:57,449 --> 01:13:59,110
"Student Council, two years. "

850
01:14:01,386 --> 01:14:05,049
Well, Joel, this is very respectable.

851
01:14:05,557 --> 01:14:07,548
You've done some very solid work here.

852
01:14:09,128 --> 01:14:11,119
But it isn't quite lvy League, is it?

853
01:14:17,302 --> 01:14:19,998
You know, Bill...

854
01:14:20,405 --> 01:14:23,465
...there's one thing I've learned
in all my years.

855
01:14:24,076 --> 01:14:27,910
Sometimes you have to say,
"What the fuck."

856
01:14:27,980 --> 01:14:29,072
Make your move.

857
01:14:31,416 --> 01:14:32,405
I beg your pardon?

858
01:14:35,254 --> 01:14:36,414
So, how are you doing?

859
01:14:37,589 --> 01:14:39,580
Looks like University of lllinois!

860
01:14:39,925 --> 01:14:41,916
"All right, all right!

861
01:14:42,494 --> 01:14:44,928
"Dance, Music, Sex, Romance!

862
01:14:45,430 --> 01:14:49,264
"Everybody say, Oooh, all right!

863
01:14:50,936 --> 01:14:53,928
" Dance, Music, Sex, Romance!

864
01:14:57,276 --> 01:14:59,938
" Everybody clap your hands now! "

865
01:15:22,701 --> 01:15:25,033
Some of your friends
are looking for you.

866
01:15:28,040 --> 01:15:29,701
What do you want me to tell them?

867
01:15:33,545 --> 01:15:35,206
Did that guy from Princeton leave yet?

868
01:15:36,048 --> 01:15:38,482
No, he's still here.
He's talking to some of the girls.

869
01:15:39,151 --> 01:15:39,981
Talking?

870
01:15:40,819 --> 01:15:42,150
They're very good talkers.

871
01:15:45,657 --> 01:15:48,649
I don't think I'm going to say,
"What the fuck" anymore.

872
01:15:49,828 --> 01:15:53,161
This thing has gotten out of control.

873
01:15:55,234 --> 01:15:56,565
I'm going to kill Miles.

874
01:15:57,669 --> 01:15:59,159
Oh, come on, Joel.

875
01:16:01,907 --> 01:16:05,001
Look at it this way.
You're making a lot of money.

876
01:16:05,677 --> 01:16:08,407
You're providing your friends
with an invaluable service.

877
01:16:08,480 --> 01:16:10,345
God knows, they needed the service!

878
01:16:11,750 --> 01:16:15,413
And, right now, you are one
hot shit future enterpriser.

879
01:16:19,925 --> 01:16:23,019
Don't worry so much. I'll be upstairs.

880
01:16:26,365 --> 01:16:29,027
And...you have yourself
a girlfriend to boot.

881
01:16:30,035 --> 01:16:30,694
Do l?

882
01:16:31,036 --> 01:16:32,025
Telephone call for Joel.

883
01:16:32,938 --> 01:16:33,768
Here, I'll get it.

884
01:16:35,274 --> 01:16:36,206
Well, do l?

885
01:16:38,877 --> 01:16:39,866
What do you think?

886
01:16:40,779 --> 01:16:41,871
I don't know. You tell me.

887
01:16:42,881 --> 01:16:44,212
Yes? No? Maybe?

888
01:16:46,551 --> 01:16:47,449
Yes.

889
01:16:50,222 --> 01:16:50,881
No.

890
01:16:54,459 --> 01:16:55,289
Maybe.

891
01:17:00,232 --> 01:17:01,062
Joel!

892
01:17:02,401 --> 01:17:03,095
Dad?

893
01:17:03,402 --> 01:17:04,391
Who answered the telephone?

894
01:17:05,237 --> 01:17:06,568
Just a friend, Dad.

895
01:17:06,905 --> 01:17:07,735
Do I know her?

896
01:17:08,073 --> 01:17:09,563
Have you ever made love
on a real train?

897
01:17:09,908 --> 01:17:11,068
I don't think so.

898
01:17:11,743 --> 01:17:12,732
He's got a girl.

899
01:17:13,745 --> 01:17:15,576
Let's make love on a real train.

900
01:17:16,581 --> 01:17:17,411
Joel, are you there?

901
01:17:17,749 --> 01:17:22,083
I'm still here, Dad. How is Mom?
Is everything all right?

902
01:17:22,421 --> 01:17:23,319
Let's go.

903
01:17:23,488 --> 01:17:24,477
Do I hear other voices?

904
01:17:26,591 --> 01:17:28,081
Just a few friends, Dad.

905
01:17:32,164 --> 01:17:33,256
Sounds like a party.

906
01:17:34,766 --> 01:17:35,596
A party?!

907
01:17:36,435 --> 01:17:37,766
Come on, let's be alone together.

908
01:17:38,437 --> 01:17:41,099
I don't remember giving
permission for a party, Joel.

909
01:17:43,842 --> 01:17:46,436
Honey, can you hear me?

910
01:17:46,511 --> 01:17:48,502
There's nothing wrong
with having friends over.

911
01:17:48,947 --> 01:17:51,609
Just use your best judgment.
We trust you.

912
01:17:52,351 --> 01:17:55,377
Remember, we're arriving tomorrow
at 3:00, United Airlines, Flight 162.

913
01:17:55,454 --> 01:17:57,285
"Trust."

914
01:17:57,356 --> 01:18:00,052
Seems to me if there is any logic
to our language...

915
01:18:00,125 --> 01:18:01,956
..."trust" would be a four-letter word.

916
01:18:04,463 --> 01:18:07,626
The evening worked out well.
We had a good cash flow.

917
01:18:08,800 --> 01:18:10,961
Rutherford made a few new friends.

918
01:18:12,137 --> 01:18:13,536
He said he'd do his best for me.

919
01:18:21,813 --> 01:18:23,474
Finally, it was time to close shop.

920
01:18:25,317 --> 01:18:26,807
The girls were exhausted.

921
01:18:27,652 --> 01:18:30,246
Lana was hungry.
She wanted to go out for a bite.

922
01:18:31,656 --> 01:18:33,988
She wanted to make love
on a real train.

923
01:18:35,227 --> 01:18:36,558
Who was I to say no?

924
01:18:38,830 --> 01:18:43,324
" I can feel it coming
in the air tonight

925
01:18:49,174 --> 01:18:53,838
"And I've been waiting for
this moment for all my life

926
01:18:59,017 --> 01:19:01,008
"Can you feel it coming"

927
01:19:01,353 --> 01:19:03,344
I thought no one was going to be here.

928
01:19:05,857 --> 01:19:06,846
Be patient.

929
01:19:18,203 --> 01:19:22,867
"Well, I remember, I remember -
don't worry

930
01:19:25,277 --> 01:19:29,941
" How could I ever forget?
It's the first time -

931
01:19:31,616 --> 01:19:34,949
"The last time we ever met

932
01:19:38,290 --> 01:19:41,623
" But I know the reason

933
01:19:41,960 --> 01:19:44,952
"Why you keep the silence up

934
01:19:45,564 --> 01:19:47,555
" No, you don't fool me

935
01:19:48,900 --> 01:19:50,561
"The hurt doesn't show

936
01:19:51,303 --> 01:19:53,635
" But the pain still grows

937
01:19:53,972 --> 01:19:56,634
" It's no stranger to you or me

938
01:19:59,744 --> 01:20:04,238
" I can feel it coming
in the air tonight

939
01:20:10,322 --> 01:20:14,986
"Well, I've been waiting for
this moment for all my life

940
01:20:20,165 --> 01:20:24,829
" I can feel it coming
in the air tonight"

941
01:24:13,398 --> 01:24:14,057
Hi.

942
01:24:14,399 --> 01:24:16,060
They stole the goddamn house, Lana!

943
01:24:16,401 --> 01:24:17,390
I'm not here right now.

944
01:24:18,169 --> 01:24:20,228
But if you'll leave
your name and number,

945
01:24:20,305 --> 01:24:22,068
I'll call you back as soon as possible.

946
01:24:23,675 --> 01:24:25,575
They took everything!

947
01:24:25,643 --> 01:24:26,507
This is unbelievable!

948
01:24:26,845 --> 01:24:30,042
My parents will be home in two hours,
Lana, and they took fucking everything!

949
01:24:30,515 --> 01:24:32,779
I don't know if you know
anything about this.

950
01:24:32,851 --> 01:24:34,512
But you have to call me right away!

951
01:24:34,853 --> 01:24:36,252
I'm at the house: KL5-2121.

952
01:24:36,855 --> 01:24:38,846
Look, you've really got to help me!

953
01:24:39,858 --> 01:24:41,189
Time of your life, huh, kid?

954
01:24:42,360 --> 01:24:43,349
Where's Lana?

955
01:24:43,695 --> 01:24:44,923
Maybe she's on the choo-choo.

956
01:24:45,363 --> 01:24:47,695
I understand she has a thing
about choo-choos.

957
01:24:48,266 --> 01:24:50,029
I want to know who stole my things.

958
01:24:50,368 --> 01:24:52,859
Oh, I took your things,
Joel, are you kidding?

959
01:24:53,605 --> 01:24:55,698
Then you listen to me, buster!

960
01:24:55,774 --> 01:24:56,763
You a-hole!

961
01:24:57,208 --> 01:24:58,539
If I don't get my things back--

962
01:24:59,611 --> 01:25:00,509
Shit!

963
01:25:10,288 --> 01:25:11,220
A-hole?!

964
01:25:12,223 --> 01:25:14,384
I want my furniture back, right now!

965
01:25:15,393 --> 01:25:16,223
Now, you listen to me.

966
01:25:16,561 --> 01:25:18,552
Oh, no, no!
You listen to me!

967
01:25:20,131 --> 01:25:20,825
Shit!

968
01:25:27,739 --> 01:25:29,070
This is getting boring.

969
01:25:29,574 --> 01:25:32,907
Can I have my furniture back?
Please?

970
01:25:33,411 --> 01:25:35,402
You listen to me, you little fuck!

971
01:25:36,915 --> 01:25:38,746
You not only took my two best girls!

972
01:25:39,651 --> 01:25:42,313
You call me names and insult me!

973
01:25:43,321 --> 01:25:44,083
I'm sorry.

974
01:25:44,422 --> 01:25:46,083
If I had any self-respect...

975
01:25:46,424 --> 01:25:48,415
...it wouldn't be your furniture!

976
01:25:48,760 --> 01:25:52,924
It would be your legs! Your arms!
Your head!

977
01:25:54,432 --> 01:25:55,763
Do we understand each other?

978
01:25:56,100 --> 01:25:57,089
Yes, we do.

979
01:25:57,502 --> 01:26:00,164
No! Do we understand each other?

980
01:26:01,840 --> 01:26:03,102
Yes, we understand each other.

981
01:26:06,511 --> 01:26:07,671
Well, you're lucky in one respect.

982
01:26:09,948 --> 01:26:10,607
What's that?

983
01:26:12,617 --> 01:26:13,675
I like you, Joel.

984
01:26:15,954 --> 01:26:16,943
Don't you know that?

985
01:26:27,131 --> 01:26:28,120
What time is it?

986
01:26:29,133 --> 01:26:30,122
It's 4:15.

987
01:26:31,469 --> 01:26:32,299
I'll find a cab.

988
01:26:32,804 --> 01:26:34,135
Something must have happened.

989
01:26:36,307 --> 01:26:37,137
Taxi!

990
01:26:43,114 --> 01:26:44,103
Joel, do you like music?

991
01:26:45,283 --> 01:26:46,614
This is beautiful equipment.

992
01:26:48,353 --> 01:26:51,083
What do you say, $300...

993
01:26:51,155 --> 01:26:52,349
...amps and speakers, the works?

994
01:26:52,957 --> 01:26:53,787
It's a bargain, Joel.

995
01:26:54,125 --> 01:26:57,185
You would have to pay twice
as much for it anywhere else.

996
01:26:58,463 --> 01:27:00,863
All right! He likes music!

997
01:27:14,545 --> 01:27:17,036
How 'bout some women's outfits?

998
01:27:17,115 --> 01:27:18,810
You know, somethin' for your mom?

999
01:27:19,217 --> 01:27:20,377
Should fit her okay.

1000
01:27:20,985 --> 01:27:21,644
Yes.

1001
01:27:22,153 --> 01:27:22,812
What?

1002
01:27:23,321 --> 01:27:24,310
Yes, I'll buy it!

1003
01:27:24,656 --> 01:27:25,987
I haven't given you a price yet.

1004
01:27:26,658 --> 01:27:28,319
Can we get through this, please?

1005
01:27:28,660 --> 01:27:29,649
$125.

1006
01:27:34,832 --> 01:27:36,322
That's all, you have everything.

1007
01:27:36,668 --> 01:27:37,657
Wait a minute.

1008
01:27:41,506 --> 01:27:42,495
What about this?

1009
01:27:44,008 --> 01:27:44,838
What is that?

1010
01:27:45,843 --> 01:27:47,834
Some glass, artsy-fartsy thing.

1011
01:27:48,846 --> 01:27:50,507
How much money do you have left, Joel?

1012
01:27:51,182 --> 01:27:52,171
$40.

1013
01:27:53,351 --> 01:27:56,013
I don't think I can sell the
artsy-fartsy thing for $40.

1014
01:27:57,088 --> 01:27:59,249
-What do you think, Vic?
-He's only got $40.

1015
01:27:59,524 --> 01:28:01,082
I only have $40.

1016
01:28:01,426 --> 01:28:04,361
I'll sell it to you for $340.

1017
01:28:05,029 --> 01:28:07,190
I'll spot you the $300.

1018
01:28:07,265 --> 01:28:08,527
You're good for it, right?

1019
01:28:09,534 --> 01:28:10,193
Certainly.

1020
01:28:10,702 --> 01:28:11,600
I think he's good for it.

1021
01:28:11,936 --> 01:28:12,595
Here!

1022
01:28:12,937 --> 01:28:13,699
Catch!

1023
01:28:26,451 --> 01:28:27,440
To Joel!

1024
01:28:27,885 --> 01:28:31,548
Here's wishin' you good luck
on your future as a businessman!

1025
01:28:31,889 --> 01:28:35,381
Because, God knows,
you're going to need it!

1026
01:29:15,600 --> 01:29:17,090
Be careful, you'll break it!

1027
01:29:17,435 --> 01:29:20,927
That's good. Thank you,
thank you, thank you!

1028
01:29:21,606 --> 01:29:25,599
Keep the Chinese pieces together, and
put the Greek pieces on another shelf.

1029
01:29:26,277 --> 01:29:29,269
I don't think you should mix centuries.

1030
01:29:45,129 --> 01:29:47,620
Mom! Dad! You're home!

1031
01:29:49,801 --> 01:29:50,790
Where were you?

1032
01:29:51,469 --> 01:29:52,458
I was here.

1033
01:29:52,804 --> 01:29:54,465
We called from the airport!

1034
01:29:55,306 --> 01:29:57,297
I must have been outside watering.

1035
01:29:57,642 --> 01:29:59,633
I thought you were coming
home tomorrow.

1036
01:29:59,977 --> 01:30:01,638
Sweetheart, I said the 5th.

1037
01:30:02,380 --> 01:30:04,371
No, you said the 6th. I wrote it down.

1038
01:30:04,715 --> 01:30:07,206
I'm sure I told you the 5th.

1039
01:30:07,885 --> 01:30:09,216
Help me bring in the luggage.

1040
01:30:09,554 --> 01:30:10,543
She said the 6th.

1041
01:30:14,892 --> 01:30:15,551
Joel?

1042
01:30:15,993 --> 01:30:16,823
Yes, Mom?

1043
01:30:18,496 --> 01:30:19,827
Can I talk to you for a minute?

1044
01:30:25,336 --> 01:30:26,325
What happened to my egg?

1045
01:30:27,405 --> 01:30:28,394
What do you mean?

1046
01:30:29,574 --> 01:30:30,905
There's a crack in it!

1047
01:30:33,244 --> 01:30:34,233
You're kidding!

1048
01:30:34,912 --> 01:30:36,402
No, Joel, I'm not kidding.

1049
01:30:37,014 --> 01:30:39,346
There's a small crack, inside the egg.

1050
01:30:39,684 --> 01:30:40,582
What's wrong?

1051
01:30:40,918 --> 01:30:41,907
My egg is ruined.

1052
01:30:42,920 --> 01:30:43,852
What happened?

1053
01:30:45,690 --> 01:30:46,679
I don't know.

1054
01:30:47,024 --> 01:30:48,013
You don't know.

1055
01:30:50,027 --> 01:30:51,688
Mom, maybe it was cracked before.

1056
01:30:52,430 --> 01:30:53,920
I don't think so, Joel.

1057
01:30:54,365 --> 01:30:56,026
How could you let this happen?

1058
01:30:59,370 --> 01:31:00,268
I'm sorry.

1059
01:31:00,605 --> 01:31:02,596
This is so damned irresponsible of you!

1060
01:31:02,940 --> 01:31:05,204
We'll get another egg,
and Joel will pay for it.

1061
01:31:06,544 --> 01:31:07,533
Sure, I'll pay for it.

1062
01:31:09,380 --> 01:31:13,043
Where will you get the money
to pay for something like that?

1063
01:31:14,051 --> 01:31:16,451
I'm very disappointed in you.

1064
01:31:23,961 --> 01:31:24,950
Mother will be all right.

1065
01:31:25,396 --> 01:31:27,557
Why don't you put in some yard work?

1066
01:32:27,858 --> 01:32:31,259
Do you have something to tell me?

1067
01:32:33,698 --> 01:32:35,495
No...

1068
01:32:35,566 --> 01:32:36,362
...I don't think so.

1069
01:32:37,868 --> 01:32:41,201
I just received a telephone call
from Bill Rutherford.

1070
01:32:43,975 --> 01:32:47,308
Apparently, you two had
quite a meeting.

1071
01:32:51,716 --> 01:32:54,048
" Princeton can use a guy like Joel. "

1072
01:32:56,153 --> 01:32:56,812
What?

1073
01:32:57,555 --> 01:33:00,046
" Princeton can use a guy like Joel. "

1074
01:33:01,559 --> 01:33:02,651
His exact words!

1075
01:33:05,162 --> 01:33:06,493
That is unbelievable!

1076
01:33:06,831 --> 01:33:08,924
You're as good as in!

1077
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:10,331
I knew you could do it!

1078
01:33:10,835 --> 01:33:13,497
Haven't I told you before,
sometimes you have to say:

1079
01:33:13,671 --> 01:33:15,662
"What the heck! "
Gotta take some chances.

1080
01:33:16,173 --> 01:33:17,162
You were so right.

1081
01:33:17,842 --> 01:33:19,173
You've made me very proud.

1082
01:33:25,683 --> 01:33:27,344
I was just thinking...

1083
01:33:28,586 --> 01:33:30,918
...where we might be ten years from now.

1084
01:33:33,691 --> 01:33:35,659
You know what I think?

1085
01:33:35,726 --> 01:33:37,694
I think we're both going
to make it big!

1086
01:33:38,195 --> 01:33:41,528
I'm very optimistic! I mean it!

1087
01:33:44,935 --> 01:33:45,924
Can I ask you something?

1088
01:33:51,542 --> 01:33:53,533
Was our night together...

1089
01:33:56,547 --> 01:33:59,311
...just to set up...

1090
01:33:59,383 --> 01:34:00,543
...Vicki and Guido?

1091
01:34:13,064 --> 01:34:14,395
You don't believe me, do you?

1092
01:34:17,234 --> 01:34:20,203
My name is Russell Bitterman.
I'm from Wheaton High School.

1093
01:34:20,304 --> 01:34:24,297
Our product is a paper-towel
holder that sells for $8.95.

1094
01:34:25,076 --> 01:34:28,409
We made a profit of $850 last semester.

1095
01:34:34,652 --> 01:34:35,983
I don't want you to get hurt.

1096
01:34:38,923 --> 01:34:43,087
My name is Evonne Williams.
We sell decorative planters for $7.

1097
01:34:44,328 --> 01:34:47,161
We made a profit
of $500 last semester.

1098
01:34:50,267 --> 01:34:53,259
Guess we won't see
each other for a while.

1099
01:34:53,604 --> 01:34:54,593
I know.

1100
01:34:56,607 --> 01:34:58,006
Are you going straight home now?

1101
01:34:58,342 --> 01:34:59,331
I don't know, why?

1102
01:35:00,277 --> 01:35:03,769
It might be nice if we spent
the evening together.

1103
01:35:04,949 --> 01:35:06,280
I'd really enjoy that.

1104
01:35:07,952 --> 01:35:09,943
How much you got on you?

1105
01:35:11,622 --> 01:35:13,146
How much have I got on me?

1106
01:35:13,224 --> 01:35:14,452
I have $20.

1107
01:35:15,126 --> 01:35:16,286
$20, Lana?

1108
01:35:17,361 --> 01:35:19,022
What are we going to do about this?

1109
01:35:19,630 --> 01:35:22,463
-Can I send it to you?
-Can you send it to me?!

1110
01:35:23,334 --> 01:35:25,268
'Cause I don't have that much here.

1111
01:35:25,336 --> 01:35:26,496
How 'bout I write you a check?

1112
01:35:26,971 --> 01:35:30,134
Do you think I'd accept a check
from you? What am l, stupid?

1113
01:35:31,642 --> 01:35:32,973
I have a bond at the bank.

1114
01:35:34,979 --> 01:35:36,640
My name is Joel Goodson.

1115
01:35:37,648 --> 01:35:39,479
I deal in human fulfillment.

1116
01:35:40,651 --> 01:35:43,984
I grossed over $8,000 in one evening.

1117
01:35:44,989 --> 01:35:46,980
The time of your life, huh kid?
