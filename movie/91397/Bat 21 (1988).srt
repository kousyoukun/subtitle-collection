1
00:00:40,839 --> 00:00:48,479
This film contains very strong language and some violent scenes

2
00:00:54,359 --> 00:00:55,679
Nice shot, Hamb.

3
00:00:55,679 --> 00:00:58,079
I drilled a little to the left.

4
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:00,279
It's 15 feet from the goddamn hole.

5
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:03,519
I miscalculated the wind by a couple knots.

6
00:01:03,519 --> 00:01:04,599
Give me a break.

7
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:06,719
Well, you know, it's all a matter of degrees.

8
00:01:06,719 --> 00:01:09,879
The difference between the big money and not making the cut is razor-thin.

9
00:01:12,359 --> 00:01:15,439
Well, I wasn't thinking about qualifying for the Masters.

10
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:18,279
Kind of had my sights set on the NBA.

11
00:01:18,279 --> 00:01:22,119
HELICOPTER WHIRRS OVERHEAD

12
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:30,919
Well, your hook shot's working, Scotty.

13
00:01:46,759 --> 00:01:48,239
Nice shot.

14
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:56,399
What do you think I'm doing wrong here?

15
00:01:58,239 --> 00:02:01,159
I think you're standing too close to the ball.

16
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:02,599
Yeah. Pretty bad, huh?

17
00:02:02,599 --> 00:02:03,999
After you hit it.

18
00:02:03,999 --> 00:02:05,039
..Yeah?

19
00:02:05,039 --> 00:02:07,879
They want you at ops right away, sir.

20
00:04:23,999 --> 00:04:29,519
- MAN:
- Russian tanks, 8-inch guns, and APCs.

21
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:32,119
Seventh Air Force intelligence has been indicating

22
00:04:32,119 --> 00:04:34,799
the possibility of a North Vietnamese/VC offensive.

23
00:04:34,799 --> 00:04:36,759
Now, these photos confirm it.

24
00:04:38,159 --> 00:04:41,719
NVA troops moving down the Ho Chi Minh Trail,

25
00:04:41,719 --> 00:04:46,159
south of the DMZ, near Quang Tri.

26
00:04:46,159 --> 00:04:47,919
Now, they'll combine with Charlie

27
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:50,799
and try to hit us hard,

28
00:04:50,799 --> 00:04:53,119
probably in several places at once.

29
00:04:54,079 --> 00:04:56,079
Glad you could make it, Colonel.

30
00:04:56,079 --> 00:04:57,879
Sorry, sir.

31
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:02,119
Strategic Air Command's putting everything it's got

32
00:05:02,119 --> 00:05:05,119
in the air two days from now and will just clobber the hell out of them.

33
00:05:05,119 --> 00:05:07,439
If we don't stop their movement,

34
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:10,439
or at least slow it down to a trickle,

35
00:05:10,439 --> 00:05:12,839
our ground troops are going to take heavy casualties.

36
00:05:12,839 --> 00:05:15,479
Now, our job remains the same,

37
00:05:15,479 --> 00:05:18,319
fly alongside the bombers,

38
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:20,479
throw down your electronic smoke screens,

39
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:22,559
jam the missile radars.

40
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:25,279
Sir, why don't we put our surveillance aircraft up there first, sir?

41
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:28,519
Have them fly the same route the big boys are going to fly on their scheduled run.

42
00:05:28,519 --> 00:05:30,079
Missile reaction can be recorded,

43
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:33,039
launch sites plotted.

44
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:35,999
Send the fighter jocks in there to just knock the hell out of them.

45
00:05:51,719 --> 00:05:55,199
I really appreciate you volunteering us for this flight, Hamb.

46
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:57,919
Didn't think you had your sights set on being a full bird.

47
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:00,319
I've got my sights set on a condo

48
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:03,199
on the seventh fairway at Tucson National.

49
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:06,079
Six months from now, that's where the old lady and me will be.

50
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:08,479
That sounds awfully exciting(!)

51
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:11,479
You think that's exciting?

52
00:06:11,479 --> 00:06:13,079
You should see the deck furniture.

53
00:06:13,079 --> 00:06:15,239
Ha!

54
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:25,999
Mark. Start your music.

55
00:06:28,159 --> 00:06:30,079
I've got a solid growl.

56
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:32,359
SAM on scope. I confirm a launch.

57
00:06:32,359 --> 00:06:34,599
I got him.

58
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:41,079
Goddamn it. I didn't think they had SAMs this far south.

59
00:06:41,079 --> 00:06:42,999
That's why we're here.

60
00:06:42,999 --> 00:06:45,519
Have to go back and give them the bad news.

61
00:06:45,519 --> 00:06:47,519
I've got another one.

62
00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:49,359
SAM on scope. 2, salvo 3.

63
00:06:49,359 --> 00:06:53,159
They're changing frequencies. I've got one.

64
00:06:53,159 --> 00:06:56,079
Hold it steady. Got two.

65
00:06:56,079 --> 00:06:57,919
- Got one visual.
- Break left!

66
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:00,079
Break left! LOUD BUZZING

67
00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:02,639
It's tracking us! It's locked!

68
00:07:06,519 --> 00:07:09,919
We're hit! Everybody get out!

69
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:12,039
We're going down!

70
00:07:12,039 --> 00:07:13,079
We're burning up!

71
00:07:14,159 --> 00:07:17,519
Hit by SAM! Mayday! Mayday!

72
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:19,439
I've lost it. Crew eject! Crew eject!

73
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:21,119
I can't get out!

74
00:07:21,119 --> 00:07:23,759
Red Scout One hit by SAMs!

75
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:25,199
Punch out, Hamb!

76
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:26,639
Come on, Scotty! Let's get out!

77
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:28,039
Right behind you!

78
00:07:28,039 --> 00:07:29,199
Mayday! Mayday!

79
00:07:39,239 --> 00:07:42,159
Punch out, Scotty! Somebody punch out!

80

This is FAC 02, call sign Birddog.

87
00:08:18,079 --> 00:08:19,719
Identify yourself.

88
00:08:19,719 --> 00:08:23,359
Bat 21. I'm the parachute above you, one o'clock.

BEEPING

90
00:08:24,919 --> 00:08:29,279
Have you in sight. Turn off your beeper, Bat 21,

91
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:32,039
or Charlie will get to you before the Jolly Greens.

92
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:34,279
Will advise. Happy landings.

93
00:08:34,279 --> 00:08:35,759
Roger.

94
00:09:15,679 --> 00:09:17,879
Bat 21, get out of that paddy!

95
00:09:17,879 --> 00:09:20,279
Hooches to the south. Head north to the tree line.

96
00:09:20,279 --> 00:09:23,159
Repeat, head north to the tree line.

97
00:09:31,359 --> 00:09:34,159
Repeat, tree line north. Roger that?

98
00:09:34,159 --> 00:09:36,559
Negative. I want to wait for the choppers.

99
00:09:36,559 --> 00:09:37,919
Negative.

100
00:09:37,919 --> 00:09:39,919
Let's get the basic relationship down here.

101
00:09:39,919 --> 00:09:43,559
I'm the lifeguard. You're the drowning man.

102
00:09:43,559 --> 00:09:45,919
If you relax, I can bring you to shore.

103
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:48,079
If you fight me, then I'll have to slap you around.

104
00:09:48,079 --> 00:09:50,159
Now, get your ass in gear, mister!

105
00:09:59,439 --> 00:10:02,279
Bat 21, Charlie's firing mortars from the south.

106
00:10:02,279 --> 00:10:04,799
Advise at tree line. Repeat, advise at tree line.

PLANE APPROACHES

108
00:10:58,559 --> 00:11:01,799
Birddog, this is Bat 21. I can't go any further.

109
00:11:01,799 --> 00:11:03,319
Get the helis from this position.

110
00:11:03,319 --> 00:11:06,239
- Copy, Bat 21.
- What about the others?

111
00:11:06,239 --> 00:11:07,839
Anybody else make it out?

112
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:10,559
None reported. We're still looking.

113
00:11:10,559 --> 00:11:12,519
Just stay calm.

114
00:11:12,519 --> 00:11:14,919
I'll try.

115
00:11:14,919 --> 00:11:18,039
Don't worry, Bat 21. We'll get you out.

116
00:11:18,039 --> 00:11:20,199
But it's not going to happen today.

117
00:11:20,199 --> 00:11:23,119
All choppers busy evac-ing fire base at Quang Tri.

118
00:11:23,119 --> 00:11:25,519
Company of guns overrun by Charlie.

119
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:28,399
Jolly Greens will pick you up in the morning.

120
00:11:37,559 --> 00:11:40,359
Say again, your last transmission.

121
00:11:40,359 --> 00:11:44,639
Repeat, Jolly Greens will pick you up in the morning.

122
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:48,439
There will be no pick-up today. Copy, Bat 21?

123
00:11:48,439 --> 00:11:50,439
EXPLOSIONS IN THE DISTANCE

124
00:11:51,879 --> 00:11:53,759
I copy, Birddog.

125
00:11:53,759 --> 00:11:55,719
OK, listen, Bat 21.

126
00:11:55,719 --> 00:12:00,359
I'm running low on juice. Have to return to base.

127
00:12:00,359 --> 00:12:02,359
Birddog, thanks for your help.

128
00:12:02,359 --> 00:12:04,759
That's what I'm here for.

129
00:12:04,759 --> 00:12:06,719
Birddog, you going to be back?

130
00:12:06,719 --> 00:12:08,239
That's the plan.

131
00:12:08,239 --> 00:12:11,719
Birddog signing off. Keep your head down. See you later.

132
00:12:12,839 --> 00:12:14,999
Bat 21 out.

133
00:12:14,999 --> 00:12:16,919
PLANE FADES INTO DISTANCE

134
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:44,599
THEY SPEAK IN VIETNAMESE

HE CHANTS

137
00:13:47,319 --> 00:13:48,359
How was your flight, sir?

138
00:13:48,359 --> 00:13:53,159
Same old shit, bad movies and terrible food.

139
00:13:53,159 --> 00:13:57,319
Don't you, uh... don't you think

140
00:13:57,319 --> 00:13:58,839
you're pushing it a little, Captain?

141
00:13:58,839 --> 00:14:02,239
You've almost doubled the base record.

142
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:03,719
The base record? Sheesh!

143
00:14:03,719 --> 00:14:05,599
I'll pin a medal on my chest(!)

144
00:14:05,599 --> 00:14:07,999
Would you check my right aileron?

145
00:14:07,999 --> 00:14:10,639
It's sticking a bit, OK?

146
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:15,719
Yeah, I got to replace it, sir.

147
00:14:15,719 --> 00:14:18,119
How long will that take?

148
00:14:18,119 --> 00:14:22,519
Well, I can borrow one from 453.

149
00:14:22,519 --> 00:14:25,679
That's Anderson's ship.

150
00:14:25,679 --> 00:14:28,479
The way he flies, Captain, he'll never miss it, sir.

151
00:14:28,479 --> 00:14:33,159
Ha-ha-ha! I like your initiative, Sergeant.

152
00:14:33,159 --> 00:14:34,879
Keep it up.

153
00:14:36,439 --> 00:14:39,119
Well, we've pulled our share of pilots out of there,

154
00:14:39,119 --> 00:14:41,519
but never a 53-year-old Lieutenant Colonel.

155
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:45,319
A 53-year-old Lieutenant Colonel?

156
00:14:45,319 --> 00:14:48,319
That's right. Navigator on that EB.

157
00:14:49,679 --> 00:14:52,079
They just gave me crew codes

158
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:54,039
and no names and ranks.

159
00:14:54,039 --> 00:14:56,959
Well, I am told that Hambleton

160
00:14:56,959 --> 00:14:58,359
is one of our top people.

161
00:14:58,359 --> 00:15:00,239
He's an electronics countermeasure expert.

162
00:15:00,239 --> 00:15:02,999
I am told that the Communists

163
00:15:02,999 --> 00:15:05,319
will have a dossier on him that thick.

164
00:15:05,319 --> 00:15:07,799
So, in the morning, when we get our birds back,

165
00:15:07,799 --> 00:15:09,119
we're going to go in and get him.

166
00:15:09,119 --> 00:15:10,799
Seventh Air Force does not want Charlie

167
00:15:10,799 --> 00:15:12,679
getting their hands on him.

168
00:15:12,679 --> 00:15:14,639
We'll get him tomorrow then, sir.

169
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:16,079
In the meantime, I want you

170
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:17,479
to go back out there tonight.

171
00:15:17,479 --> 00:15:19,079
But he's not going anywhere, Colonel.

172
00:15:19,079 --> 00:15:22,279
I know, because I'm going to make damn certain he's secure.

173
00:15:22,279 --> 00:15:23,679
Then why don't you send Anderson?

174
00:15:23,679 --> 00:15:26,119
Didn't he just get his pilot's licence?

175
00:15:26,119 --> 00:15:28,519
You'd better watch it, Captain.

176
00:15:28,519 --> 00:15:31,399
Look, sir, I'm tired, I'm two weeks short,

177
00:15:31,399 --> 00:15:33,799
and that area is pretty hot,

178
00:15:33,799 --> 00:15:35,679
and I don't want to get shot down

179
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:38,639
on some public-relations mission, OK?

180
00:15:42,439 --> 00:15:45,279
All right, then, I'll make it easy for you, Captain.

181
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:48,079
It's an order, and you damn well will carry it out.

182
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:50,119
Is that clear?

183
00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:54,479
Yes, sir.

184
00:15:59,239 --> 00:16:01,679
Thank you for the ride, sir.

185
00:16:59,079 --> 00:17:00,639
TWIG SNAPS

186
00:17:59,639 --> 00:18:03,039
MEN SPEAK SOFTLY IN VIETNAMESE

187
00:18:43,399 --> 00:18:44,919
BRANCH SNAPS

188
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:37,039
Phew! OK...

189
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:38,959
50 piasters.

190
00:19:38,959 --> 00:19:40,399
THE OTHER MEN GROAN

191
00:19:40,399 --> 00:19:42,319
Come on! Chickenshits! Chickenshits!

192
00:19:42,319 --> 00:19:43,759
No way.

193
00:19:43,759 --> 00:19:45,679
OK. Hey, Clarky, pull up a chair,

194
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:47,599
before these pigeons are totally penniless.

195
00:19:47,599 --> 00:19:50,479
Another time. I got to go back up again tonight.

196
00:19:50,479 --> 00:19:51,919
Going back up again?

197
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:53,839
Damn, putting in the hours.

198
00:19:53,839 --> 00:19:55,279
Yeah. Tell Walker.

199
00:19:55,279 --> 00:19:58,119
I got to start carrying my sleeping bag with me.

200
00:19:58,119 --> 00:20:00,039
OK... I got two pair.

201
00:20:00,039 --> 00:20:02,559
Three sixes.

202
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:05,319
I've got two pairs of sevens and your other six.

203
00:20:05,319 --> 00:20:06,639
Ha-ha-ha!

204
00:20:06,639 --> 00:20:09,719
Damn! I thought you newspaper boys

205
00:20:09,719 --> 00:20:12,279
would be a bit sharper than that. What rag do you write for again?

206
00:20:12,279 --> 00:20:13,919
New York Times.

207
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:15,839
Oh, yeah, I picked one up once.

208
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:18,759
You read, Ross? Probably stole it from some derelict in the park,

209
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:20,199
who was using it as a blanket.

210
00:20:20,199 --> 00:20:21,639
I gave him a nickel!

211
00:20:21,639 --> 00:20:24,399
I couldn't find the comics, so I returned it.

212
00:20:24,399 --> 00:20:25,959
Did you get your money back?

213
00:20:25,959 --> 00:20:28,519
Yeah. I ended up finishing a pint of radiator fluid with the guy.

214
00:20:28,519 --> 00:20:30,599
It was about then I figured it was time to enlist,

215
00:20:30,599 --> 00:20:33,599
and here I am, the best goddamn evac pilot in 'Nam!

216
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:35,039
Tell it, Ross.

217
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:38,399
Flying those choppers every day scrambles up your brains. You get facts confused.

218
00:20:38,399 --> 00:20:40,319
Ross here thinks that it takes some skill

219
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:42,239
to keep one of those eggbeaters up in the air.

220
00:20:42,239 --> 00:20:43,599
Typical FAC pilot.

221
00:20:43,599 --> 00:20:45,199
He labours under the misapprehension

222
00:20:45,199 --> 00:20:47,519
that he is the most Sierra-Hotel cowboy in the Air Force.

223
00:20:47,519 --> 00:20:48,999
The real truth is, he flies

224
00:20:48,999 --> 00:20:50,879
a fucking VW Microbus with wings.

225
00:20:50,879 --> 00:20:53,239
Well, this VW pilot

226
00:20:53,239 --> 00:20:55,199
flies ten feet off the deck,

227
00:20:55,199 --> 00:20:57,799
draws fire from SAMs down to eight-year-olds

228
00:20:57,799 --> 00:20:59,239
with slingshots and pebbles.

229
00:20:59,239 --> 00:21:02,319
Ha-ha-ha! A confirmation on that.

230
00:21:02,319 --> 00:21:03,599
A lot of times, I've seen Clark

231
00:21:03,599 --> 00:21:05,159
return here... You want one?

232
00:21:05,159 --> 00:21:06,319
..with leaves in his teeth.

233
00:21:06,319 --> 00:21:07,359
Because...

234
00:21:07,359 --> 00:21:08,399
Two.

235
00:21:08,399 --> 00:21:10,679
..us black folks ain't got no depth perception.

236
00:21:10,679 --> 00:21:12,719
So we gots to fly what we gets.

237
00:21:12,719 --> 00:21:14,359
MEN LAUGH

238
00:21:14,359 --> 00:21:16,999
They won't let us fly fast aeroplanes!

239
00:21:16,999 --> 00:21:20,559
You got to be particular in this man's Air Force.

240
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:24,999
Now, right here, you are looking at a perfect flyboy profile.

241
00:21:24,999 --> 00:21:28,519
The kind of guy you can trust when the shit hits the fan.

242
00:21:28,519 --> 00:21:31,399
Boom. It's hit the fan, man!

243
00:21:35,799 --> 00:21:37,279
See you later, Clarky.

244
00:21:37,279 --> 00:21:39,319
Later, Clarky.

245
00:21:39,319 --> 00:21:42,599
Don't wait up for me, OK?

246
00:21:42,599 --> 00:21:44,639
Take care.

247
00:21:50,199 --> 00:21:53,239
PLANE FLIES OVERHEAD

248
00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:00,399
Birddog, Bat 21. Is that you?

249
00:22:00,399 --> 00:22:03,639
Roger, Bat 21. It's me.

250
00:22:03,639 --> 00:22:07,559
I need a visual reference, so I can stay in range.

251
00:22:07,559 --> 00:22:09,559
You'll need one.

252
00:22:31,359 --> 00:22:32,799
Got you, Bat 21.

253
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:35,359
Positive contact.

254
00:22:41,439 --> 00:22:44,999
I appreciate you dropping by, Birddog.

255
00:22:44,999 --> 00:22:47,399
That's what I'm here for.

256
00:22:47,399 --> 00:22:52,799
Charlie walked by my hole about an hour ago.

257
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:54,599
How many?

258
00:22:54,599 --> 00:22:59,399
10 or 12. It seems to be quiet now.

259
00:22:59,399 --> 00:23:01,599
Just stay calm.

260
00:23:01,599 --> 00:23:04,239
You'll be out of there in the morning.

261
00:23:05,639 --> 00:23:08,999
Birddog, could you do me a personal favour?

262
00:23:08,999 --> 00:23:10,919
Shoot.

263
00:23:10,919 --> 00:23:12,839
Get in touch with my wife.

264
00:23:12,839 --> 00:23:14,759
I was supposed to call her tonight.

265
00:23:14,759 --> 00:23:16,879
She'll be scared to death.

266
00:23:16,879 --> 00:23:18,559
Her name is Gwen.

267
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:20,479
I know. I pulled your personal file.

268
00:23:20,479 --> 00:23:22,399
I got her address and number,

269
00:23:22,399 --> 00:23:24,799
but I think you should let it ride for a day.

270
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:26,559
She may not be too excited

271
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:28,639
about where you decided to spend the night.

272
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:32,959
Yeah, we'll do it your way.

273
00:23:32,959 --> 00:23:35,879
I'm glad somebody's thinking clearly.

274
00:23:35,879 --> 00:23:38,719
How long you been flying Oscar-Deuces?

275
00:23:38,719 --> 00:23:41,839
Too long. Due to rotate soon.

276
00:23:41,839 --> 00:23:44,959
You know, I'm probably the oldest captain in the Air Force.

277
00:23:44,959 --> 00:23:46,879
How old are you?

278
00:23:46,879 --> 00:23:49,319
Would you believe, 35 in June?

279
00:23:49,319 --> 00:23:53,079
Ha-ha-ha! That's not very old.

280
00:23:53,079 --> 00:23:56,039
Shit. Sometimes, it is.

281
00:23:57,879 --> 00:23:59,959
Are you married, Birddog?

282
00:23:59,959 --> 00:24:02,679
Yeah.

283
00:24:02,679 --> 00:24:05,479
Got a wife and kid back home.

284
00:24:14,199 --> 00:24:16,599
I've been thinking about my old lady a lot

285
00:24:16,599 --> 00:24:18,559
since I've been down here.

286
00:24:20,439 --> 00:24:22,799
Funny how that works.

287
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:25,679
She keeps bugging me that my mind

288
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:29,039
is someplace else when I'm with her.

289
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:33,119
Yeah, yeah, I know what you mean.

290
00:24:33,119 --> 00:24:36,239
Any news on the other crew members?

291
00:24:36,239 --> 00:24:38,639
No. No other chutes were spotted.

292
00:24:38,639 --> 00:24:40,599
We're still searching for the wreckage.

293
00:24:40,599 --> 00:24:41,999
The jungle is hot.

294
00:24:41,999 --> 00:24:44,399
Has anyone contacted Scott's wife?

295
00:24:44,399 --> 00:24:47,799
Yeah. That's been taken care of.

296
00:24:47,799 --> 00:24:49,719
THEY SPEAK VIETNAMESE

297
00:24:52,079 --> 00:24:54,479
I feel like a real jerk.

298
00:24:54,479 --> 00:24:57,359
I'm the big expert on this deal,

299
00:24:57,359 --> 00:24:59,239
and I get us shot down.

300
00:24:59,239 --> 00:25:03,439
Don't beat yourself up, Bat 21. It happens.

301
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:08,359
You OK for the night, Bat 21?

302
00:25:10,319 --> 00:25:13,639
Yeah. No problem. Thanks for checking in.

303
00:25:13,639 --> 00:25:16,039
Then I'm RTB.

304
00:25:16,039 --> 00:25:17,999
Tuck yourself in.

305
00:25:17,999 --> 00:25:20,999
Carpool will pick you up at first light.

306
00:25:20,999 --> 00:25:25,119
This is Birddog signing off, Bat 21.

307
00:25:52,999 --> 00:25:54,959
ENGINES IN DISTANCE

308
00:27:34,639 --> 00:27:37,159
Birddog, Birddog, this is Bat 21.

309
00:27:37,159 --> 00:27:39,039
Are you in the vicinity?

310
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:41,799
Roger, Bat 21.

311
00:27:41,799 --> 00:27:44,759
Just about to give you a wake-up call.

312
00:27:44,759 --> 00:27:47,079
Birddog, take a look at the intersection

313
00:27:47,079 --> 00:27:48,999
of hollywood and vine. Rush-hour traffic.

314
00:27:48,999 --> 00:27:51,399
Could be a problem for our Jolly Greens.

315
00:27:51,399 --> 00:27:54,279
Roger, Bat 21. Stand by.

316
00:27:54,279 --> 00:27:56,199
Let's put some hits on these guys.

317
00:27:56,199 --> 00:27:59,279
I got a good visual. I'll call them.

318
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:02,719
You sure? You're pretty close to the action. You might get nicked.

319
00:28:02,719 --> 00:28:04,319
I can see the crossroads from here.

320
00:28:04,319 --> 00:28:06,719
About half a click south of the rice paddy.

321
00:28:06,719 --> 00:28:08,119
Mark it.

322
00:28:08,119 --> 00:28:11,359
You pulling rank on me, Bat 21?

323
00:28:11,359 --> 00:28:12,759
I'll take my chances.

324
00:28:12,759 --> 00:28:14,319
You got it.

325
00:28:14,319 --> 00:28:17,279
Here you go. Enjoy the show!

326
00:28:25,639 --> 00:28:27,799
MEN SHOUTING/MACHINE GUNS FIRING

327
00:28:32,359 --> 00:28:37,519
Birddog to Crabtree, I marked my targets. What are you hauling?

328
00:28:37,519 --> 00:28:39,759
Roger, Birddog. This is Crabtree,

329
00:28:39,759 --> 00:28:41,719
coming in from the south

330
00:28:41,719 --> 00:28:43,839
with a full load of snake and nape.

331
00:28:43,839 --> 00:28:46,519
Roger, Crabtree. You see my smoke?

332
00:28:46,519 --> 00:28:48,439
Uh...affirmative, Birddog.

333
00:28:48,439 --> 00:28:50,319
Waste the area, but remember,

334
00:28:50,319 --> 00:28:52,239
we have a friendly in the vicinity.

335
00:28:52,239 --> 00:28:55,479
Try not to ruin his day with a stray frag.

336
00:28:55,479 --> 00:28:56,799
Don't worry, Birddog.

337
00:28:56,799 --> 00:28:59,399
We can thread a needle if we have to.

338
00:28:59,399 --> 00:29:02,839
Thread a needle, my ass. Shit. Ha-ha!

339
00:29:51,319 --> 00:29:53,239
Birddog, on your next pass,

340
00:29:53,239 --> 00:29:55,599
move just east of the intersection.

341
00:29:55,599 --> 00:29:57,959
You got camouflaged tanks.

342
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:02,319
Roger, Bat 21.

343
00:30:02,319 --> 00:30:05,199
Crabtree, tanks just east of intersection,

344
00:30:05,199 --> 00:30:07,119
Missed on first pass.

345
00:30:07,119 --> 00:30:09,999
Roger, Birddog.

346
00:30:09,999 --> 00:30:11,879
MACHINE GUNS FIRE

347
00:30:37,799 --> 00:30:42,759
We're Winchester, Birddog. Please assess damage.

348
00:30:42,759 --> 00:30:45,079
Additional targets still appear active.

349
00:30:45,079 --> 00:30:48,279
Copy, Crabtree. Return to base. Will advise.

350
00:30:52,119 --> 00:30:53,759
MAN SHOUTS

351
00:31:02,839 --> 00:31:04,319
GUNSHOT

352
00:31:20,439 --> 00:31:24,319
Uh, Bat 21 from Birddog.

353
00:31:24,319 --> 00:31:27,279
Uh, Bat 21?

354
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:30,679
Bat 21 from Birddog.

355
00:31:30,679 --> 00:31:33,119
Do you copy, Bat 21?

356
00:31:34,959 --> 00:31:36,879
Go, Birddog.

357
00:31:36,879 --> 00:31:38,319
You intact?

358
00:31:40,679 --> 00:31:42,679
Affirmative.

359
00:31:42,679 --> 00:31:44,079
Nice quarterbacking.

360
00:31:44,079 --> 00:31:46,919
Maybe we ought to leave you in for the second half.

361
00:31:46,919 --> 00:31:48,879
Negative. I've seen enough.

362
00:31:48,879 --> 00:31:51,919
I guess it's different on the ground.

363
00:31:54,479 --> 00:31:56,519
It's too damn close.

364
00:31:56,519 --> 00:31:59,439
Bat 21, your pick-up may be delayed.

365
00:31:59,439 --> 00:32:02,279
The area is still too hot.

366
00:32:02,279 --> 00:32:05,199
Negative! Negative! It's got to be today, goddamn it!

367
00:32:05,199 --> 00:32:08,479
I repeat, area's still too hot.

368
00:32:08,479 --> 00:32:10,879
It's a war zone, goddamn it! What do you expect?!

369
00:32:10,879 --> 00:32:14,279
Relax, Bat 21. We'll get you out at first light.

370
00:32:14,279 --> 00:32:15,679
Jesus Christ!

371
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:20,079
Just stay calm. Birddog will deliver.

372
00:32:20,079 --> 00:32:23,199
Negative, Birddog. Bat 21 has a plan.

373
00:32:23,199 --> 00:32:24,519
I worked it out last night.

374
00:32:24,519 --> 00:32:26,759
Birddog would like to RTB, refuel,

375
00:32:26,759 --> 00:32:28,999
and confirm before you move.

376
00:32:28,999 --> 00:32:31,639
Negative, Birddog. Not enough time.

377
00:32:39,399 --> 00:32:42,079
Bat 21! Bat 21!

378
00:32:42,079 --> 00:32:45,479
Birddog would like to confirm before you move.

379
00:32:46,879 --> 00:32:49,279
Negative. Bat's on the move.

380
00:32:49,279 --> 00:32:51,199
Heading for the swanee.

381
00:32:51,199 --> 00:32:52,639
Swanee?

382
00:32:52,639 --> 00:32:54,879
Repeat, heading for the swanee,

383
00:32:54,879 --> 00:32:56,959
Like in the song. "Swanee, swanee.

384
00:32:56,959 --> 00:32:58,879
"How I love you. How I love you."

385
00:32:58,879 --> 00:33:00,479
Yeah, yeah, I know the song.

386
00:33:00,479 --> 00:33:02,959
"Swanee, How I Love You."

387
00:33:04,839 --> 00:33:08,319
Uh-huh. I think I broke the code, Bat 21.

388
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:09,919
But still do not advise.

389
00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:11,959
Route takes you through too many unfriendlies.

390
00:33:11,959 --> 00:33:13,759
Birddog has no way to track you.

391
00:33:13,759 --> 00:33:16,599
I worked out a front nine to avoid the hazards.

392
00:33:16,599 --> 00:33:20,319
Copy this. Add zero to yardage.

393
00:33:20,319 --> 00:33:23,199
Holes three, six and eight at Shaw.

394
00:33:23,199 --> 00:33:27,159
South one and 17 at Macdill.

395
00:33:27,159 --> 00:33:31,479
Coming in on two, 12, 14, and 18 at Hickum.

396
00:33:31,479 --> 00:33:32,919
How do you copy?

397
00:33:32,919 --> 00:33:35,519
Copy, but I still don't know what the hell you're talking about.

398
00:33:38,679 --> 00:33:42,999
Contact Colonel Douglass at Kerat Air Base for instructions.

399
00:33:42,999 --> 00:33:46,839
I'm not sure this is a good idea, Bat 21.

400
00:33:46,839 --> 00:33:51,959
Bat 21 is teeing off from the blue markers now. Out.

401
00:33:54,479 --> 00:33:57,879
Uh, Bat 21, from Birddog.

402
00:33:57,879 --> 00:34:01,679
Uh, Bat 21, Bat 21, from Birddog.

403
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:03,719
Bat... Oh, shit!

404
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:24,679
You want to tell me about it?

405
00:34:24,679 --> 00:34:26,639
Hambleton's moving on me.

406
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:28,519
Where's he going?

407
00:34:28,519 --> 00:34:31,679
I don't know. He gave me some kind of goddamned code,

408
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:34,279
after I decided it was too hot to pick him up.

409
00:34:34,279 --> 00:34:37,359
- Yeah, I heard you brought in the flyboys.
- Mm-mmm...

410
00:34:37,359 --> 00:34:39,959
That was his idea.

411
00:34:39,959 --> 00:34:41,639
That's some kind of tough bastard.

412
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:42,919
Shit!

413
00:34:42,919 --> 00:34:44,879
I mean, he must realise

414
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:46,759
they aren't always that accurate.

415
00:34:46,759 --> 00:34:50,119
I've seen frags drop 30 feet in front of my windscreen.

416
00:34:50,119 --> 00:34:51,559
Mm-hmm.

417
00:34:51,559 --> 00:34:53,879
Wait, wait, wait. Where are you going?

418
00:34:53,879 --> 00:34:56,639
Sit down and finish your beer. Sit down.

419
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:59,639
I got to go up again. I got to find him.

420
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:02,279
You're spending more time in the air than on Mother Earth.

421
00:35:02,279 --> 00:35:03,799
You look like hell.

422
00:35:06,879 --> 00:35:08,839
Well, I need the overtime.

423
00:35:08,839 --> 00:35:11,679
You are going for a DFFC, aren't you?

424
00:35:11,679 --> 00:35:14,599
A Distinguished Fucking Flying Cross.

425
00:35:14,599 --> 00:35:17,479
Man, I must have vapour-locked, or something.

426
00:35:17,479 --> 00:35:20,839
"FAC pilot saves Colonel!"

427
00:35:20,839 --> 00:35:23,239
You're gearing up for the ceremony. A full dress parade,

428
00:35:23,239 --> 00:35:25,639
a nice shiny medal to show the folks back home,

429
00:35:25,639 --> 00:35:28,479
and a newfound respect in the military community.

430
00:35:28,479 --> 00:35:31,079
Shit! Clarky, stick around. Come on.

431
00:35:31,079 --> 00:35:32,639
We'll take a chopper up.

432
00:35:32,639 --> 00:35:35,039
We'll shoot a few cows and have a barbecue. What do you say?

433
00:35:35,039 --> 00:35:38,079
Ross, not tonight, yeah?

434
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:40,039
Don't you think you've got

435
00:35:40,039 --> 00:35:42,679
a little obsessive behaviour going here?

436
00:35:42,679 --> 00:35:45,919
Obsessive behaviour? Me, obsessive behaviour?

437
00:35:45,919 --> 00:35:48,159
Man, I recall some of the crazy, lunatic shit

438
00:35:48,159 --> 00:35:49,599
that you've done in your machine.

439
00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:52,799
Maybe I like hauling those sorry dudes out of the bush.

440
00:35:52,799 --> 00:35:56,039
Maybe I like to see their big, sloppy smiles when I drag them into the chopper,

441
00:35:56,039 --> 00:35:59,959
because you just know they thought they were going to spend the rest of the war dodging punji sticks,

442
00:35:59,959 --> 00:36:02,999
snakes, and gooks, and I hand them a camel and a candy bar,

443
00:36:02,999 --> 00:36:06,359
and they smile like when they got laid for the first time.

444
00:36:06,359 --> 00:36:08,759
I'm not into this death-and-destruction bullshit either,

445
00:36:08,759 --> 00:36:10,359
or flying fucking medals.

446
00:36:10,359 --> 00:36:14,919
You know, all I want to do is bring the old man back.

447
00:36:16,439 --> 00:36:19,799
OK... Go on. Get him through the night.

448
00:36:19,799 --> 00:36:23,199
I'll haul his ass out in the morning.

449
00:36:23,199 --> 00:36:25,119
OK, Birddog?

450
00:37:31,279 --> 00:37:32,479
CLUCKING

451
00:38:28,839 --> 00:38:30,719
MAN SPEAKS IN VIETNAMESE

452
00:38:33,439 --> 00:38:35,639
HE REPLIES IN VIETNAMESE

453
00:38:35,639 --> 00:38:38,159
MAN SPEAKS ANGRILY

454
00:38:43,679 --> 00:38:47,479
No, no, no, no. Look... Friend.

455
00:38:47,479 --> 00:38:49,919
HE REPEATS THE SAME WORD IN VIETNAMESE

456
00:38:51,839 --> 00:38:55,359
< Friend. Friend. MAN SHOUTS ANGRILY

457
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:22,199
GUNSHOT

458
00:39:53,679 --> 00:39:55,919
Pa?

459
00:39:58,439 --> 00:40:00,879
I'm sorry.

460
00:40:22,919 --> 00:40:25,799
WOMAN SOBS SOFTLY

461
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:41,119
HE GROANS

462
00:41:59,799 --> 00:42:01,479
HE SOBS

463
00:42:06,839 --> 00:42:09,359
No, no, no. Number 14 at Hickum.

464
00:42:09,359 --> 00:42:12,239
Right, Hickum.

465
00:42:12,239 --> 00:42:15,039
Yeah, the par four across the water.

466
00:42:15,039 --> 00:42:17,479
That's the one. Hold the phone a minute.

467
00:42:17,479 --> 00:42:19,279
Uh, Captain,

468
00:42:19,279 --> 00:42:22,279
Uh...number 14 at Hickum, 390 yards.

469
00:42:22,279 --> 00:42:23,759
Draw it in.

470
00:42:23,759 --> 00:42:25,679
Don't forget to add the zero.

471
00:42:25,679 --> 00:42:27,079
Come here, Clark.

472
00:42:27,079 --> 00:42:29,039
Colonel, that puts our puzzle together.

473
00:42:29,039 --> 00:42:32,879
Now let's hope the damn thing works. ..Right.

474
00:42:32,879 --> 00:42:35,759
Yeah, I will keep you abreast of everything.

475
00:42:35,759 --> 00:42:37,199
Right, I will.

476
00:42:37,199 --> 00:42:40,119
And thank you. Mm-hmm.

477
00:42:41,479 --> 00:42:43,879
What have we got, sir?

478
00:42:43,879 --> 00:42:47,719
I got a lot to tell you about your boy.

479
00:42:47,719 --> 00:42:49,639
Seems like Hambleton was flying

480
00:42:49,639 --> 00:42:52,999
a pave-penny mission for a major bombing strike, Captain.

481
00:42:52,999 --> 00:42:54,919
He came up with the idea himself,

482
00:42:54,919 --> 00:42:56,839
and then he volunteers to go.

483
00:42:56,839 --> 00:42:58,759
Right man for the job and all that.

484
00:42:58,759 --> 00:43:01,639
Sounds like to me he must have written the damn manuals.

485
00:43:01,639 --> 00:43:03,559
Wouldn't Charlie like to get

486
00:43:03,559 --> 00:43:05,959
their hands on him, open him up? Shit.

487
00:43:05,959 --> 00:43:08,359
It doesn't get any better.

488
00:43:08,359 --> 00:43:11,239
The strike was scheduled for 07:00 hours tomorrow.

489
00:43:11,239 --> 00:43:13,159
Their objective, carpet-bomb

490
00:43:13,159 --> 00:43:15,039
this crossroads where Hambleton is

491
00:43:15,039 --> 00:43:18,519
and everything around it for 8 kilometres.

492
00:43:18,519 --> 00:43:21,319
HE SIGHS

493
00:43:22,719 --> 00:43:25,599
That's what he was talking about.

494
00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:27,719
Exactly.

495
00:43:30,719 --> 00:43:32,279
He won't make it.

496
00:43:32,279 --> 00:43:35,999
They're going to blast the whole goddamn area, huh?

497
00:43:35,999 --> 00:43:37,919
I'm fucking blowing my brains out

498
00:43:37,919 --> 00:43:39,519
trying to get this motherfucker home,

499
00:43:39,519 --> 00:43:41,439
and they're talking about carpet-bombing!

500
00:43:41,439 --> 00:43:42,879
Goddamn it, Captain...

501
00:43:42,879 --> 00:43:44,319
Now, wait a minute...

502
00:43:44,319 --> 00:43:45,959
Shut up, goddamn it!

503
00:43:48,119 --> 00:43:50,959
I bought us 24 hours.

504
00:43:50,959 --> 00:43:53,399
That's the best I could do.

505
00:43:53,399 --> 00:43:56,759
Had to put my ass on the line to get that.

506
00:43:56,759 --> 00:43:59,679
I told Seventh Air we'd get him out of there.

507
00:43:59,679 --> 00:44:02,319
That's exactly what we're going to do.

508
00:44:08,279 --> 00:44:10,359
Nice work, Colonel.

509
00:44:10,359 --> 00:44:12,279
Let's don't start jumping up and down,

510
00:44:12,279 --> 00:44:14,999
throwing babies in the air yet, Captain.

511
00:44:14,999 --> 00:44:16,919
We'd better wait and see

512
00:44:16,919 --> 00:44:18,879
if Hambleton's code works.

513
00:44:18,879 --> 00:44:21,439
Hmm. You got any ideas?

514
00:44:21,439 --> 00:44:22,879
Douglass knew what Hambleton

515
00:44:22,879 --> 00:44:25,599
was talking about right away.

516
00:44:25,599 --> 00:44:27,479
I mean, they're both golf fanatics.

517
00:44:27,479 --> 00:44:30,399
They play three times a week. Hambleton's got a four handicap.

518
00:44:30,399 --> 00:44:32,839
With all that in mind, come here. I want to show you something.

519
00:44:32,839 --> 00:44:34,199
..Thank you, Howard.

520
00:44:36,079 --> 00:44:38,479
Now...stay with me, Captain.

521
00:44:38,479 --> 00:44:40,439
This gets pretty wild.

522
00:44:40,439 --> 00:44:44,839
Hambleton wants to get here to the river, to the swanee, right?

523
00:44:44,839 --> 00:44:46,119
Well, how's he going to do that?

524
00:44:46,119 --> 00:44:49,159
I mean, he's not about to just tear ass out through there

525
00:44:49,159 --> 00:44:50,479
and lose contact with you.

526
00:44:50,479 --> 00:44:51,519
Hell, he's dead meat.

527
00:44:51,519 --> 00:44:53,879
On the other hand, he can't get on the radio

528
00:44:53,879 --> 00:44:55,999
and tell you where he's going. Charlie's got VHF too.

529
00:44:55,999 --> 00:44:59,079
So he gives you an imaginary nine holes of golf.

530
00:44:59,079 --> 00:45:01,479
When you lay those nine holes over our map, Captain...

531
00:45:01,479 --> 00:45:04,959
there's what they look like.

532
00:45:04,959 --> 00:45:07,319
Now we can track him,

533
00:45:07,319 --> 00:45:09,199
now that we know where he is.

534
00:45:09,199 --> 00:45:11,079
We know exactly where he comes out at the end

535
00:45:11,079 --> 00:45:13,319
because he didn't pick those holes at random.

536
00:45:13,319 --> 00:45:15,359
They come off three Air Force golf courses

537
00:45:15,359 --> 00:45:17,039
he's played a hundred times,

538
00:45:17,039 --> 00:45:18,719
knows them like the back of his hand.

539
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:20,239
Now, let's take these three

540
00:45:20,239 --> 00:45:22,119
that come off Shaw Air Force base.

541
00:45:22,119 --> 00:45:25,039
First hole, 410-yard par-four dogleg.

542
00:45:25,039 --> 00:45:27,439
We add that zero Hambleton's talking about,

543
00:45:27,439 --> 00:45:28,839
it reads 4,100 yards,

544
00:45:28,839 --> 00:45:31,239
and the first green puts him right there.

545
00:45:31,239 --> 00:45:33,159
Next green, here and here.

546
00:45:33,159 --> 00:45:36,679
These two holes come off the front and back of Macdill.

547
00:45:36,679 --> 00:45:38,439
These four finishing holes here,

548
00:45:38,439 --> 00:45:39,999
according to Douglass,

549
00:45:39,999 --> 00:45:41,479
are the holes Hambleton birdied

550
00:45:41,479 --> 00:45:43,239
the last time he played Hickum

551
00:45:43,239 --> 00:45:45,159
to shoot a one-under-par 71.

552
00:45:45,159 --> 00:45:47,079
Pretty good score, huh? Ha-ha-ha!

553
00:45:47,079 --> 00:45:49,719
Clever son of a bitch.

554
00:45:49,719 --> 00:45:51,159
You play golf, Captain?

555
00:45:51,159 --> 00:45:53,799
No, sir. Golf wasn't big in my neighbourhood.

556
00:45:53,799 --> 00:45:56,679
All right. Well, all these holes are on these cards,

557
00:45:56,679 --> 00:45:59,559
and this is a glossary of golf terminology.

558
00:45:59,559 --> 00:46:02,399
Now, you're going to communicate with Hambleton

559
00:46:02,399 --> 00:46:04,439
using these terms, because Charlie won't know

560
00:46:04,439 --> 00:46:06,239
what in the hell you're talking about

561
00:46:06,239 --> 00:46:07,719
until it's too late, anyway.

562
00:46:07,719 --> 00:46:10,079
So get busy. Learn this.

563
00:46:10,079 --> 00:46:12,999
That's the key to Hambleton's code.

564
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:18,239
Dogleg.

565
00:46:18,239 --> 00:46:20,679
Dogleg.

566
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:23,119
Hmm.

567
00:47:29,519 --> 00:47:31,559
Does Anderson know you borrowed his prop?

568
00:47:31,559 --> 00:47:32,599
No, sir.

569
00:47:32,599 --> 00:47:34,479
I'd love to be there when he tries to take off.

570
00:47:34,479 --> 00:47:37,279
He's going to need a hell of a long runway, Captain.

571
00:47:37,279 --> 00:47:38,399
Yeah.

572
00:47:38,399 --> 00:47:41,039
Look, at the risk of being out of line, sir,

573
00:47:41,039 --> 00:47:42,639
I think you look a bit overextended.

574
00:47:42,639 --> 00:47:45,879
Now, in the best interest of the mission and your personal safety,

575
00:47:45,879 --> 00:47:47,279
I put together this tape.

576
00:47:47,279 --> 00:47:48,919
Some serious sounds, Captain.

577
00:47:48,919 --> 00:47:51,479
They're guaranteed to keep you alert.

578
00:47:51,479 --> 00:47:54,679
You're quite a man, Rumbaugh.

579
00:47:54,679 --> 00:47:58,239
You just have a good flight, all right, sir?

580
00:47:58,239 --> 00:47:59,719
All right.

597
00:50:15,719 --> 00:50:20,079
It's good to hear your voice, Birddog.

598
00:50:20,079 --> 00:50:21,959
I'm at the third fairway,

599
00:50:21,959 --> 00:50:23,959
trying to get a fix on your position.

600
00:50:23,959 --> 00:50:25,399
You broke the code.

601
00:50:25,399 --> 00:50:28,279
I'm working on it. It's not an easy game to play.

602
00:50:28,279 --> 00:50:29,999
Uh, what is your...

603
00:50:32,679 --> 00:50:33,719
..lie?

604
00:50:33,719 --> 00:50:38,319
Birddog, I'm 150 yards northwest of the third green.

605
00:50:38,319 --> 00:50:42,199
I'll give you a signal, white one.

606
00:50:50,679 --> 00:50:52,319
Got you marked.

607
00:50:58,719 --> 00:50:59,919
Any problems?

608
00:50:59,919 --> 00:51:02,759
I ran into an unfriendly a while back.

609
00:51:02,759 --> 00:51:05,159
I had to do some backtracking.

610
00:51:05,159 --> 00:51:07,079
You all right?

611
00:51:07,079 --> 00:51:09,159
My landing gear's a little damaged,

612
00:51:09,159 --> 00:51:10,879
but it's still serviceable.

613
00:51:10,879 --> 00:51:14,119
I'm sorry to hear about that.

614
00:51:17,159 --> 00:51:19,079
Listen, Birddog...

615
00:51:19,079 --> 00:51:21,959
you got to get me out of here.

616
00:51:21,959 --> 00:51:23,759
Affirmative.

617
00:51:23,759 --> 00:51:25,839
I'm here to tell you the good news.

618
00:51:25,839 --> 00:51:28,639
We bought 24 hours. Copy that?

619
00:51:28,639 --> 00:51:31,279
You bet I copy.

620
00:51:31,279 --> 00:51:33,159
You must have friends in high places

621
00:51:33,159 --> 00:51:34,919
who want to see your face again.

622
00:51:34,919 --> 00:51:37,279
That's nice to know.

623
00:51:37,279 --> 00:51:39,999
Uh, Bat 21...

624
00:51:39,999 --> 00:51:41,799
stay put and don't transmit.

625
00:51:41,799 --> 00:51:43,919
I have business to take care of.

626
00:51:48,319 --> 00:51:50,279
Uh, this is Birddog. This is Birddog.

00:52:17,079 --> 00:52:19,079
Birddog...

636
00:52:20,959 --> 00:52:23,919
..I killed a man today.

637
00:52:25,759 --> 00:52:28,279
Uh... Roger that.

638
00:52:30,559 --> 00:52:32,679
He wasn't even a soldier.

639
00:52:34,239 --> 00:52:36,479
He just kept coming.

640
00:52:36,479 --> 00:52:38,439
I couldn't stop him.

641
00:52:40,839 --> 00:52:43,999
Uh...I understand.

642
00:52:45,399 --> 00:52:49,479
I didn't want to do it.

643
00:52:49,479 --> 00:52:52,159
I never had to do anything like that before in my life.

644
00:52:53,559 --> 00:52:55,479
I've always been sitting in an airplane

645
00:52:55,479 --> 00:52:59,199
at 30,000 feet with a cup of coffee in front of me.

646
00:53:01,319 --> 00:53:03,519
Look here, Bat 21, I never met you,

647
00:53:03,519 --> 00:53:05,079
but you don't sound like a killer.

648
00:53:05,079 --> 00:53:07,479
I'm sure you couldn't stop it from happening.

649
00:53:07,479 --> 00:53:10,719
Now, the important thing is to put it behind you.

650
00:53:13,559 --> 00:53:14,839
EXPLOSION

651
00:53:16,559 --> 00:53:18,479
What the hell's going on, Birddog?

652
00:53:18,479 --> 00:53:21,839
There's too many unfriendly foursomes in your vicinity.

654
00:53:24,239 --> 00:53:25,679
MORE EXPLOSIONS

655
00:53:25,679 --> 00:53:27,599
JETS PASS OVERHEAD

656
00:53:27,599 --> 00:53:32,439
Jesus Christ! Does it ever stop?

657
00:53:33,839 --> 00:53:36,239
Are you with me, Bat 21?

658
00:53:36,239 --> 00:53:38,639
Yeah, Birddog, I'm here.

659
00:53:38,639 --> 00:53:40,279
All right.

660
00:53:40,279 --> 00:53:42,479
I want you to listen real hard.

661
00:53:42,479 --> 00:53:44,879
I know you're hurting, but we have to deal with

662
00:53:44,879 --> 00:53:46,799
getting you back to the clubhouse.

663
00:53:46,799 --> 00:53:49,759
We're going to pick you up at first light.

664
00:53:49,759 --> 00:53:51,559
Damn, I'm ready.

665
00:53:51,559 --> 00:53:52,999
JET PASSES OVERHEAD

666
00:53:52,999 --> 00:53:55,879
I want you to play the fourth hole tonight.

667
00:53:55,879 --> 00:53:58,319
The green will be our LZ.

668
00:54:00,199 --> 00:54:03,079
That's a long goddamn hole.

669
00:54:03,079 --> 00:54:04,999
Yeah. There's a few hazards,

670
00:54:04,999 --> 00:54:06,959
but the green is safe.

671
00:54:06,959 --> 00:54:09,319
EXPLOSIONS CONTINUE

672
00:54:09,319 --> 00:54:12,239
Think you can make it, Bat 21?

673
00:54:13,679 --> 00:54:16,519
Yeah, I should be able to play through.

674
00:54:16,519 --> 00:54:19,119
Looking forward to buying you a drink.

675
00:54:19,119 --> 00:54:22,319
I'll start the tab.

676
00:54:22,319 --> 00:54:24,159
Roger that.

677
00:54:24,159 --> 00:54:25,879
Birddog signing off.

678
00:54:25,879 --> 00:54:27,399
I'll see you in the morning.

679
00:56:22,159 --> 00:56:25,519
Uh, Bat 21, this is Birddog. Come in.

680
00:56:29,359 --> 00:56:31,759
Birddog, Bat 21. Go ahead.

681
00:56:31,759 --> 00:56:34,159
Are you still on course?

682
00:56:36,519 --> 00:56:39,399
Birddog, yeah, I'm an easy chip shot

683
00:56:39,399 --> 00:56:40,839
from the green,

684
00:56:40,839 --> 00:56:44,279
except that there's a village right here in front of me.

685
00:56:44,279 --> 00:56:46,599
Reconned yesterday. Area's safe.

686
00:56:46,599 --> 00:56:48,559
We'll take another look.

687
00:56:48,559 --> 00:56:51,439
OK, Birddog.

688
00:57:02,639 --> 00:57:04,359
Shine up your medal, Clarky,

689
00:57:04,359 --> 00:57:05,959
I'm bringing back your boy.

690
00:57:05,959 --> 00:57:09,719
I'll personally alert Bat 21.

691
00:57:09,719 --> 00:57:14,079
Bat 21, this is Birddog again. Come in.

692
00:57:14,079 --> 00:57:16,239
Yeah, Birddog, I'm still here.

693
00:57:16,239 --> 00:57:18,639
Not for long. I'm sending in my best man.

694
00:57:18,639 --> 00:57:20,599
Get your flares ready, and don't pop the smoke

695
00:57:20,599 --> 00:57:24,399
until you hear from Jolly Greens. Understand?

696
00:57:24,399 --> 00:57:26,359
Roger, Birddog.

697
00:57:36,399 --> 00:57:40,719
- WALKER:
- Bat 21, Cobra Leader. Do you copy?

698
00:57:42,159 --> 00:57:43,799
Go ahead.

699
00:57:43,799 --> 00:57:46,439
We'll come over your position from the north.

700
00:57:46,439 --> 00:57:48,919
Be ready to pop those flares.

701
00:57:48,919 --> 00:57:51,359
I've been ready for two days.

702
00:58:10,799 --> 00:58:12,919
Hold what you got, Big Sky.

703
00:58:12,919 --> 00:58:15,719
I'm going to send Birddog in to take a look.

704
00:58:15,719 --> 00:58:17,799
Roger.

705
00:58:31,599 --> 00:58:33,679
Talk to me, Birddog.

706
00:58:33,679 --> 00:58:36,039
Looks quiet.

707
00:58:36,039 --> 00:58:39,719
I'm going in for a closer look.

708
00:58:39,719 --> 00:58:43,039
Here we go. Be right back.

709
00:59:02,079 --> 00:59:05,119
It don't look like anybody's home.

710
00:59:18,159 --> 00:59:21,479
All right, Big Sky, go get him.

711
00:59:21,479 --> 00:59:23,759
I'll cover your tail.

712
00:59:34,319 --> 00:59:35,879
Jolly Green from Birddog.

713
00:59:35,879 --> 00:59:38,319
You're looking good, looking good.

714
00:59:38,319 --> 00:59:41,079
Coming in on your LZ.

715
00:59:47,919 --> 00:59:50,519
SHOUTING IN VIETNAMESE

716
00:59:58,079 --> 00:59:59,759
Shit! We're taking hits.

717
01:00:01,759 --> 01:00:04,359
The village is hot! The village is hot!

718
01:00:04,359 --> 01:00:07,519
Birddog, there's at least two machine guns in the village!

719
01:00:07,519 --> 01:00:11,159
I thought you said that goddamn LZ was secure!

720
01:00:11,159 --> 01:00:14,159
Get back in the trees, Bat 21. Back in the trees!

721
01:00:23,919 --> 01:00:26,119
Stevie, open up.

722
01:00:44,639 --> 01:00:46,319
Get those mines ready.

723
01:00:46,319 --> 01:00:48,639
We're going to drop them right here in this paddy.

724
01:00:48,639 --> 01:00:50,359
Keep them away from Bat 21.

725
01:01:06,559 --> 01:01:08,719
Drop those mines!

726
01:01:17,399 --> 01:01:19,279
Son of a bitch!

727
01:01:23,239 --> 01:01:26,159
Big Sky, get the hell out of there.

728
01:01:26,159 --> 01:01:28,639
I'm coming back. Open up, Steven.

729
01:01:30,439 --> 01:01:33,359
Get on those guns and give them hell.

730
01:01:44,119 --> 01:01:45,159
Agh!

731
01:01:45,159 --> 01:01:47,239
Son of a bitch! He's hit!

732
01:01:47,239 --> 01:01:49,839
Take care of him. Hendricks, get on the gun!

733
01:01:49,839 --> 01:01:51,559
We're going to fix you up.

734
01:01:51,559 --> 01:01:53,919
Big Sky, abort mission.

735
01:01:53,919 --> 01:01:56,879
Repeat, abort! Abort!

736
01:01:58,439 --> 01:02:01,159
Boys, they're not going to stick a fork in me till I'm done.

737
01:02:01,159 --> 01:02:02,559
We're going to get that boy.

738
01:02:02,559 --> 01:02:05,119
Abort mission, Big Sky! Get the hell out of there, Ross!

739
01:02:05,119 --> 01:02:07,359
Sorry. Transmission is breaking up.

740
01:02:07,359 --> 01:02:09,439
Repeat, abort!

741
01:02:09,439 --> 01:02:11,999
Sorry. Transmission is breaking up.

742
01:02:11,999 --> 01:02:14,599
That's bullshit! You heard me!

743
01:02:14,599 --> 01:02:16,639
I said abort!

744
01:02:23,279 --> 01:02:26,639
Fuck it. Let's go in.

745
01:02:30,559 --> 01:02:32,999
Come on, you...

746
01:02:40,679 --> 01:02:42,839
Ross, get out of there!

747
01:02:47,359 --> 01:02:48,999
Son of a bitch!

748
01:02:48,999 --> 01:02:53,119
He's hit! Birddog, he's hit!

749
01:02:53,119 --> 01:02:54,879
Shit!

750
01:02:57,159 --> 01:03:00,159
Shit! I'm losing it!

751
01:03:11,599 --> 01:03:14,479
Up, Big Sky! Big Rocks! Pull out!

752
01:03:14,479 --> 01:03:15,959
Shit. We're going down.

753
01:03:15,959 --> 01:03:18,599
We're going down. Mayday! Mayday!

754
01:03:25,279 --> 01:03:28,519
I can't see a goddamn thing, goddamn it!

755
01:03:28,519 --> 01:03:30,879
We're going down. Mayday.

756
01:03:55,559 --> 01:03:57,199
HE COUGHS

757
01:03:57,199 --> 01:03:58,679
Start, motherfucker!

758
01:03:58,679 --> 01:04:00,559
MEN SHOUT

759
01:04:00,559 --> 01:04:01,599
Start!

760
01:04:01,599 --> 01:04:03,359
Let's get out of here, Ross!

761
01:04:03,359 --> 01:04:06,159
Fuck! They're coming!

762
01:04:06,159 --> 01:04:08,759
The gun jammed! Let's go, Ross! Come on!

763
01:04:08,759 --> 01:04:12,279
Goddamn it! Let's fucking go!

764
01:04:12,279 --> 01:04:14,959
Start! Shit.

765
01:04:14,959 --> 01:04:17,359
Start!

766
01:04:17,359 --> 01:04:18,999
Shit.

767
01:04:18,999 --> 01:04:21,999
Come on, Pearson. We got to get out of here.

768
01:04:21,999 --> 01:04:23,479
Come on, Ross! Jesus! The gun!

769
01:04:23,479 --> 01:04:25,959
Come on! We got to get out of here!

770
01:04:25,959 --> 01:04:27,679
Goddamn it, come on!

771
01:04:27,679 --> 01:04:29,479
GUNFIRE

772
01:04:29,479 --> 01:04:31,279
Agh!

773
01:04:31,279 --> 01:04:33,519
Get up, man! We got to go!

774
01:04:33,519 --> 01:04:35,599
Aah!

775
01:04:40,799 --> 01:04:45,079
Finley, goddamn it! Give me the gun!

776
01:04:45,079 --> 01:04:47,559
Shit! Come on, give me the gun, Finley!

777
01:04:47,559 --> 01:04:50,479
Give me the goddamn gun, goddamn it!

778
01:04:50,479 --> 01:04:53,679
Jesus Christ! Don't shoot!

779
01:04:53,679 --> 01:04:56,399
Don't shoot!

780
01:04:56,399 --> 01:04:58,679
Don't shoot! Holy shit!

781
01:04:58,679 --> 01:05:01,919
I'm fuckin' hit, man!

782
01:05:01,919 --> 01:05:03,879
Jesus Christ!

783
01:05:03,879 --> 01:05:05,799
Oh, God!

784
01:05:05,799 --> 01:05:10,679
Steve, stay alive! Someone will be back.

785
01:05:10,679 --> 01:05:12,879
Don't fuckin' leave us, Ross!

786
01:05:12,879 --> 01:05:16,399
Just stay alive, goddamn it!

787
01:05:16,399 --> 01:05:18,959
SHOUTING IN VIETNAMESE

788
01:05:23,359 --> 01:05:24,919
Don't leave us, Ross!

789
01:05:24,919 --> 01:05:27,279
Don't worry. I'll be back.

790
01:05:27,279 --> 01:05:29,999
All right!

791
01:05:29,999 --> 01:05:32,119
SHOUTING CONTINUES

792
01:05:34,719 --> 01:05:36,879
Ross! Ross!

793
01:05:36,879 --> 01:05:39,319
GUNFIRE

794
01:05:39,319 --> 01:05:41,679
Goddamn you!

795
01:06:31,559 --> 01:06:33,879
Birddog, they've got two of our men.

796
01:06:33,879 --> 01:06:36,799
I think the rest of the crew is dead.

797
01:06:36,799 --> 01:06:38,719
Uh, copy, Bat 21. Stand by.

798
01:06:38,719 --> 01:06:40,759
Cobra Leader, Charlie has two of our airmen.

799
01:06:40,759 --> 01:06:42,559
Can you identify?

800
01:06:42,559 --> 01:06:45,919
Negative, Birddog. Can't make out from here.

801
01:06:45,919 --> 01:06:48,319
We're holding our fire.

802
01:06:48,319 --> 01:06:51,999
They shot my damn hydraulics out.

803
01:06:51,999 --> 01:06:55,559
I'm not going to be able to put this thing down here.

804
01:06:55,559 --> 01:06:57,439
I'm going down for a closer look.

805
01:06:57,439 --> 01:06:58,879
Not advisable, Birddog.

806
01:06:58,879 --> 01:07:00,959
It will be a quick pass.

807
01:07:06,319 --> 01:07:09,239
GUNFIRE

808
01:07:11,999 --> 01:07:13,599
Confirmed, two airmen.

809
01:07:13,599 --> 01:07:15,759
One is pilot.

810
01:07:25,799 --> 01:07:27,759
THEY SPEAK IN VIETNAMESE

811
01:07:29,999 --> 01:07:32,519
You know what, Charlie? I don't follow your fucking drift.

812
01:07:32,519 --> 01:07:34,919
I took Spanish in school. No comprendo.

813
01:07:34,919 --> 01:07:37,079
HE SHOUTS IN VIETNAMESE

814
01:07:37,079 --> 01:07:41,159
Get your fucking slimy fucking hands off me!

815
01:07:43,519 --> 01:07:47,239
I don't know what the fuck you're talking about!

816
01:07:47,239 --> 01:07:49,759
I don't understand you.

817
01:07:49,759 --> 01:07:53,959
Birddog, they're trying to get him to tell where I am.

818
01:07:53,959 --> 01:07:56,519
Copy, Bat 21. Just stay low.

819
01:08:08,119 --> 01:08:10,079
GUNSHOT

820
01:08:10,079 --> 01:08:12,359
Bastard! Motherfucker!

821
01:08:25,719 --> 01:08:28,199
They just killed one of our men.

822
01:08:28,199 --> 01:08:30,879
Was it the pilot, Bat 21?

823
01:08:30,879 --> 01:08:33,439
I don't think so. It's me they want.

824
01:08:33,439 --> 01:08:35,599
I'm going to give myself up.

825
01:08:35,599 --> 01:08:38,359
Keep your ass down, Bat 21! Charlie doesn't bargain.

826
01:08:38,359 --> 01:08:40,119
Nothing you can do about it.

827
01:08:40,119 --> 01:08:43,079
Now, retreat double-time back into the trees.

828
01:09:06,879 --> 01:09:08,159
Come on, fella. Come closer.

829
01:09:08,159 --> 01:09:10,359
Come on. Come on, you motherfucker.

830
01:09:10,359 --> 01:09:12,279
Come on.

831
01:09:12,279 --> 01:09:14,199
Oh!

832
01:09:14,199 --> 01:09:15,679
HE IMITATES AN EXPLOSION

833
01:09:17,079 --> 01:09:18,559
Come on.

834
01:09:18,559 --> 01:09:21,359
They're walking him out into the minefield.

835
01:09:21,359 --> 01:09:23,319
Ah, Jesus!

836
01:09:26,639 --> 01:09:28,599
Come on!

837
01:10:06,439 --> 01:10:09,319
Hey, come on!

838
01:10:09,319 --> 01:10:10,359
Agh!

839
01:10:11,719 --> 01:10:14,079
ROSS SCREAMS

840
01:10:14,079 --> 01:10:17,599
Aah! Aah!

841
01:10:19,599 --> 01:10:20,799
Goddamn it!

842
01:10:30,039 --> 01:10:33,119
Aah!

843
01:10:46,679 --> 01:10:48,639
Motherfucker!

844
01:10:50,639 --> 01:10:53,679
You lowlife...

845
01:11:09,399 --> 01:11:13,559
I've got enough dead heroes for one day, Clark!

846
01:11:13,559 --> 01:11:15,959
Get your ass out of there!

847
01:11:15,959 --> 01:11:18,159
Oh, fuck.

848
01:11:23,839 --> 01:11:26,519
You'll get Bat 21 back on the course!

849
01:11:26,519 --> 01:11:30,999
Then rendezvous with me at Hilo-1-8-5.

850
01:11:30,999 --> 01:11:33,959
I'm going to waste this whole goddamned area!

851
01:11:43,959 --> 01:11:48,759
Four-square leader, hustle your ass over here.

852
01:11:48,759 --> 01:11:52,439
One click north of Hilo-1-niner-6.

853
01:11:52,439 --> 01:11:54,839
Gun emplacement in village.

854
01:11:54,839 --> 01:11:59,119
Jolly Green down. Crew is dead.

855
01:11:59,119 --> 01:12:02,119
Look for the smoke.

856
01:12:06,279 --> 01:12:08,239
People are still in the village.

857
01:12:08,239 --> 01:12:10,159
Charlie is using them for cover.

858
01:12:10,159 --> 01:12:12,559
Stay off frequency, Bat 21.

859
01:12:12,559 --> 01:12:14,919
Await instructions from Birddog.

860
01:12:21,199 --> 01:12:25,039
Birddog. Birddog, people are in the village.

861
01:12:25,039 --> 01:12:28,719
Repeat, civilians, women and children, in the village.

862
01:12:28,719 --> 01:12:31,319
That's a confirmation. Will advise.

863
01:12:33,199 --> 01:12:35,839
Cobra Leader, this is Birddog.

864
01:12:35,839 --> 01:12:37,359
Village is still not clear.

865
01:12:37,359 --> 01:12:38,879
Civilians still in area.

866
01:12:38,879 --> 01:12:41,519
Stay off frequency.

867
01:12:41,519 --> 01:12:43,719
Delay the strike. Repeat, delay strike.

868
01:12:43,719 --> 01:12:46,999
Bat 21, get back on course.

869
01:12:46,999 --> 01:12:48,719
Will connect with you at swanee.

870
01:12:48,719 --> 01:12:51,639
Fuck the goddamn swanee. Delay the strike!

871
01:12:51,639 --> 01:12:53,319
That was my friend laying in the mud

872
01:12:53,319 --> 01:12:55,079
with his fucking head blown off!

873
01:12:55,079 --> 01:12:56,479
Now, get back on course!

874
01:12:56,479 --> 01:12:59,119
Now, do as I say! Back on course!

875
01:13:58,999 --> 01:14:01,919
People keep dying all around me.

876
01:14:06,679 --> 01:14:09,119
I'm through killing.

877
01:14:10,519 --> 01:14:12,959
I'm through, goddamn it.

878
01:14:58,479 --> 01:14:59,959
HE SIGHS

879
01:15:02,799 --> 01:15:04,879
You called for me, sir?

880
01:15:08,519 --> 01:15:09,999
Ahem...

881
01:15:09,999 --> 01:15:12,399
Lost six people today, Clark.

882
01:15:12,399 --> 01:15:14,919
Kids, all of them, just kids.

883
01:15:16,679 --> 01:15:18,999
And I couldn't guarantee

884
01:15:18,999 --> 01:15:20,479
we'd get him out of there

885
01:15:20,479 --> 01:15:22,239
if we had another week. Damn it, it's too hot.

886
01:15:22,239 --> 01:15:25,279
HE SIGHS

887
01:15:25,279 --> 01:15:28,639
So, the strike is a go...

888
01:15:28,639 --> 01:15:31,039
07:00 hours tomorrow.

889
01:15:31,039 --> 01:15:33,919
They're going to level the whole area.

890
01:15:33,919 --> 01:15:36,319
All we can do is hope and pray to God

891
01:15:36,319 --> 01:15:39,199
Hambleton makes it to the river.

892
01:15:39,199 --> 01:15:41,079
I, uh...

893
01:15:41,079 --> 01:15:43,959
Did I ever call the Navy,

894
01:15:43,959 --> 01:15:46,399
and, uh, they're going to send

895
01:15:46,399 --> 01:15:48,399
a patrol boat up there.

896
01:15:50,239 --> 01:15:52,199
Where are you headed?

897
01:15:53,599 --> 01:15:56,279
I'm going to help him make it to the river, sir.

898
01:15:57,759 --> 01:15:59,799
Planes are grounded, Clark.

899
01:15:59,799 --> 01:16:02,519
We are not to go back in there

900
01:16:02,519 --> 01:16:04,319
until the strike is over.

901
01:16:05,719 --> 01:16:08,439
Our hands are tied.

902
01:16:08,439 --> 01:16:10,399
Yes, sir.

903
01:16:22,839 --> 01:16:24,319
HE SIGHS

904
01:17:08,839 --> 01:17:11,759
Birddog, Bat 21. Over.

905
01:17:13,639 --> 01:17:16,999
Birddog, Bat 21. How do you read? Over.

906
01:17:16,999 --> 01:17:20,359
'Birddog, this is Bat 21. Come in.

907
01:17:20,359 --> 01:17:23,239
'I'm on the sixth hole, Birddog. Do you copy?

908
01:17:23,239 --> 01:17:25,679
'Birddog, this is Bat 21.

909
01:17:27,079 --> 01:17:29,079
'Come in, Birddog.'

910
01:18:32,279 --> 01:18:33,719
Thank you.

911
01:18:49,559 --> 01:18:51,199
For me?

912
01:18:53,839 --> 01:18:55,839
BOY SPEAKS IN VIETNAMESE

913
01:21:09,599 --> 01:21:12,919
Definitely not a good idea, sir. It's a bad idea.

914
01:21:12,919 --> 01:21:14,839
I trained in one of these things 15 years ago.

915
01:21:14,839 --> 01:21:16,799
So, just refresh my memory.

916
01:21:16,799 --> 01:21:18,279
You got three minutes.

917
01:21:21,599 --> 01:21:23,479
Let's go, Rumbaugh.

918
01:21:23,479 --> 01:21:24,839
All right.

919
01:21:24,839 --> 01:21:25,959
OK.

920
01:21:25,959 --> 01:21:28,279
This is your rotor speed. Keep it in the green.

921
01:21:28,279 --> 01:21:29,719
This is your engine speed.

922
01:21:29,719 --> 01:21:31,199
Keep it also in the green.

923
01:21:31,199 --> 01:21:33,039
Red-line and you crash and burn.

924
01:21:33,039 --> 01:21:35,439
All right, pedals. Pedals work the same as your ship.

925
01:21:35,439 --> 01:21:37,399
The stick does not. It's cyclic.

926
01:21:37,399 --> 01:21:39,479
It controls the angles of your blades, all right?

927
01:21:39,479 --> 01:21:42,199
I can't believe you're taking the old man's ship.

928
01:21:42,199 --> 01:21:44,879
All right, power. Power's controlled by your collective.

929
01:21:44,879 --> 01:21:46,359
One thing you may have forgotten is,

930
01:21:46,359 --> 01:21:48,879
when you increase power, you increase left pedal

931
01:21:48,879 --> 01:21:52,239
to compensate for increased torque. Got it?

932
01:21:52,239 --> 01:21:56,079
Yeah, um...yeah, it's coming back to me.

933
01:21:56,079 --> 01:21:58,679
And what about autorotation?

934
01:21:58,679 --> 01:22:00,519
Why? You planning on not coming back, sir?

935
01:22:00,519 --> 01:22:03,279
Tell me anyway.

936
01:22:03,279 --> 01:22:06,799
All right. Your engine quits.

937
01:22:06,799 --> 01:22:08,039
You're falling out of the sky.

938
01:22:08,039 --> 01:22:11,999
Now, all you've got left is the energy stored in your blades, OK?

939
01:22:11,999 --> 01:22:13,599
Push the left...

940
01:22:13,599 --> 01:22:16,799
No, push the right, the right pedal to the floor,

941
01:22:16,799 --> 01:22:18,519
collective down,

942
01:22:18,519 --> 01:22:20,639
keep your rotor speed in the green.

943
01:22:20,639 --> 01:22:24,519
Keep it at about 80 knots and about 100 feet off the deck.

944
01:22:24,519 --> 01:22:27,319
Begin to flare and then cushion it on down with the collective.

945
01:22:27,319 --> 01:22:29,719
Now, you may start to spin,

946
01:22:29,719 --> 01:22:31,959
but that's cool. Don't panic.

947
01:22:31,959 --> 01:22:34,079
Key point being, he who hesitates...

948
01:22:34,079 --> 01:22:35,999
You don't want to hesitate, all right?

949
01:22:35,999 --> 01:22:37,439
All right.

950
01:22:37,439 --> 01:22:40,279
Here's your checklist, your maps, all your golf shit.

951
01:22:40,279 --> 01:22:41,719
All right.

952
01:22:41,719 --> 01:22:43,159
Now, you got everything, right?

953
01:22:43,159 --> 01:22:44,719
You understand all this?

954
01:22:44,719 --> 01:22:45,759
Yeah.

955
01:22:45,759 --> 01:22:46,999
All right.

956
01:22:46,999 --> 01:22:48,439
Thanks for the lesson.

957
01:22:48,439 --> 01:22:49,599
Just come back, all right?

958
01:23:05,399 --> 01:23:07,759
Pedals! Pedals!

959
01:23:10,119 --> 01:23:11,959
Collective!

960
01:23:11,959 --> 01:23:13,839
Shit!

961
01:23:13,839 --> 01:23:16,159
Up! Up! Up!

962
01:23:17,919 --> 01:23:22,439
OK, all right. Torque, torque, torque.

963
01:23:24,919 --> 01:23:26,679
Get it up!

964
01:23:26,679 --> 01:23:30,199
You got it! You got it! Up!

965
01:23:41,679 --> 01:23:45,519
Who's that crazy son of a bitch?! Is that Clark?!

966
01:23:45,519 --> 01:23:47,759
I believe it is, sir.

967
01:23:47,759 --> 01:23:50,719
All right, Captain!

968
01:23:50,719 --> 01:23:53,319
We're looking at a court-martial now!

969
01:23:53,319 --> 01:23:55,239
Rotor speed up.

970
01:23:55,239 --> 01:23:57,319
Throttle friction.

971
01:24:00,119 --> 01:24:02,919
Jesus Christ!

972
01:24:02,919 --> 01:24:05,319
When he gets back here, Sergeant,

973
01:24:05,319 --> 01:24:07,239
I'm throwing his ass in the stockade!

974
01:24:07,239 --> 01:24:08,999
We don't have a stockade, sir.

975
01:24:08,999 --> 01:24:10,919
I'll build one!

976
01:24:10,919 --> 01:24:13,359
Son of a bitch!

977
01:24:21,719 --> 01:24:23,159
Good luck, Captain.

978
01:24:37,679 --> 01:24:41,759
All right, all right, all right, here I come.

979
01:25:20,919 --> 01:25:23,319
Chopper Pilot, this is Bat 21.

980
01:25:23,319 --> 01:25:24,759
This is Chopper Pilot,

981
01:25:24,759 --> 01:25:27,119
above your signal on the ninth hole.

982
01:25:27,119 --> 01:25:28,599
Is that you, Birddog?

983
01:25:28,599 --> 01:25:30,119
Yeah, it's me.

984
01:25:30,119 --> 01:25:31,919
Now, let's get you out of here.

985
01:25:31,919 --> 01:25:34,319
50 metres east of you, there's a small field.

986
01:25:34,319 --> 01:25:36,799
If I can get into it, I can make it happen.

987
01:25:36,799 --> 01:25:38,679
Copy that, Bat 21?

988
01:25:38,679 --> 01:25:41,119
I'm on my way, Birddog.

989
01:26:28,119 --> 01:26:32,279
THEY SPEAK IN VIETNAMESE

990
01:26:58,719 --> 01:27:00,559
Down!

991
01:27:17,159 --> 01:27:18,479
- Let's go!
- OK!

992
01:27:29,319 --> 01:27:30,359
Hey!

993
01:27:30,359 --> 01:27:31,959
Hang on!

994
01:27:44,759 --> 01:27:46,279
Hurry up.

995
01:27:53,919 --> 01:27:56,079
All right!

996
01:28:00,959 --> 01:28:03,559
I'm glad to see you, Birddog.

997
01:28:06,279 --> 01:28:09,119
Have a seat, Bat 21.

998
01:28:14,519 --> 01:28:17,239
You'd better check the charts.

999
01:28:17,239 --> 01:28:19,839
I had a hell of a time navigating here.

1000
01:28:22,639 --> 01:28:25,159
GUNFIRE

1001
01:28:25,159 --> 01:28:26,559
Jesus!

1002
01:28:30,319 --> 01:28:32,079
Shit!

1003
01:28:36,919 --> 01:28:39,839
You're losing oil pressure.

1004
01:28:39,839 --> 01:28:41,679
Jesus.

1005
01:28:45,679 --> 01:28:47,799
There's the river.

1006
01:28:47,799 --> 01:28:49,359
We got to make it from here.

1007
01:28:49,359 --> 01:28:52,199
I'm going to have to put this baby down, OK?

1008
01:28:54,799 --> 01:28:57,359
There's a clearing at 9 o'clock.

1009
01:29:31,719 --> 01:29:34,359
Cut into the woods!

1010
01:29:36,159 --> 01:29:38,159
GUNFIRE

1011
01:29:45,519 --> 01:29:47,119
Let's go!

1012
01:30:05,279 --> 01:30:07,679
It's the air strike.

1013
01:30:07,679 --> 01:30:10,959
It's right on time.

1014
01:30:10,959 --> 01:30:11,999
Jesus!

1015
01:30:13,639 --> 01:30:15,399
SHOUTING IN VIETNAMESE

1016
01:30:21,599 --> 01:30:24,359
Go! Move!

1017
01:31:32,919 --> 01:31:35,039
Oh, shit! Goddamn!

1018
01:33:22,839 --> 01:33:24,319
COUGHING

1019
01:34:18,479 --> 01:34:22,319
You know, I've been in the service...

1020
01:34:22,319 --> 01:34:24,759
most of my adult life.

1021
01:34:27,559 --> 01:34:29,999
It's the first time I ever saw any war.

1022
01:34:31,399 --> 01:34:35,279
Guess I was a little closer to the action.

1023
01:34:35,279 --> 01:34:36,719
Aah...

1024
01:34:36,719 --> 01:34:41,519
I've wanted to be a fighter pilot since I was a kid.

1025
01:34:41,519 --> 01:34:44,519
But they wouldn't let me out of the O-2.

1026
01:34:46,039 --> 01:34:47,319
Lucky for me.

1027
01:34:52,959 --> 01:34:55,919
You could have quit anytime.

1028
01:34:57,319 --> 01:34:59,239
Why'd you keep coming back?

1029
01:35:00,679 --> 01:35:03,519
Guess it's the stubborn side of me.

1030
01:35:03,519 --> 01:35:06,439
I started out just doing my job,

1031
01:35:06,439 --> 01:35:08,359
no different from you.

1032
01:35:09,759 --> 01:35:12,359
I hate being told I can't do something.

1033
01:35:12,359 --> 01:35:16,079
I guess that's why I'm still a captain.

1034
01:35:17,959 --> 01:35:19,879
Besides...

1035
01:35:19,879 --> 01:35:23,279
I started feeling what you were going through.

1036
01:35:24,679 --> 01:35:27,439
I heard it in your voice.

1037
01:35:34,239 --> 01:35:35,719
DISTANT RUMBLING

1038
01:35:49,599 --> 01:35:52,239
We're home free, Colonel.

1039
01:35:53,919 --> 01:35:55,839
Yeah.

1040
01:35:55,839 --> 01:35:57,319
HE SIGHS

1041
01:35:58,679 --> 01:36:01,559
Cut the Colonel crap, OK, Birddog?

1042
01:36:01,559 --> 01:36:04,439
It's Iceal Hambleton.

1043
01:36:04,439 --> 01:36:05,879
Iceal?

1044
01:36:05,879 --> 01:36:07,319
Ha-ha-ha!

1045
01:36:07,319 --> 01:36:08,759
Ha-ha-ha!

1046
01:36:08,759 --> 01:36:10,679
It's Hamb.

1047
01:36:10,679 --> 01:36:14,519
Yeah. Hey... Clark Bartholomew.

1048
01:36:14,519 --> 01:36:15,959
Bartholomew?

1049
01:36:15,959 --> 01:36:17,399
Clarky.

1050
01:36:17,399 --> 01:36:19,599
OK.

1051
01:36:35,599 --> 01:36:38,719
- MAN ON RADIO:
- This is USPB-Niner-6.

1052
01:36:38,719 --> 01:36:41,359
We have your boys aboard. Injuries have been treated.

1053
01:36:41,359 --> 01:36:43,639
Will rendezvous with you at base Victor-4.

1054
01:36:43,639 --> 01:36:46,159
This is Niner-6 out.

1055
01:36:46,159 --> 01:36:48,559
- WALKER:
- Welcome home, Bat 21.

1056
01:36:48,559 --> 01:36:51,439
Why don't you and the Captain meet me at the 19th hole?

1057
01:36:51,439 --> 01:36:53,359
The drinks are on me.

1058
01:36:53,359 --> 01:36:56,279
Cobra Leader, over and out.
