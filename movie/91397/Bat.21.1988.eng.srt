1
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:41,800
This film contains very strong language and some violent scenes

2
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,000
Nice shot, Hamb.

3
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,400
I drilled a little to the left.

4
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,600
It's 15 feet from the goddamn hole.

5
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:56,840
I miscalculated the wind by a couple knots.

6
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:57,920
Give me a break.

7
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:00,040
Well, you know, it's all a matter of degrees.

8
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:03,200
The difference between the big money and not making the cut is razor-thin.

9
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,760
Well, I wasn't thinking about qualifying for the Masters.

10
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:11,600
Kind of had my sights set on the NBA.

11
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:15,440
HELICOPTER WHIRRS OVERHEAD

12
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:24,240
Well, your hook shot's working, Scotty.

13
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:41,560
Nice shot.

14
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:49,720
What do you think I'm doing wrong here?

15
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:54,480
I think you're standing too close to the ball.

16
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:55,920
Yeah. Pretty bad, huh?

17
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,320
After you hit it.

18
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:58,360
..Yeah?

19
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:01,200
They want you at ops right away, sir.

20
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:22,840
- MAN:
- Russian tanks, 8-inch guns, and APCs.

21
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:25,440
Seventh Air Force intelligence has been indicating

22
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,120
the possibility of a North Vietnamese/VC offensive.

23
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:30,080
Now, these photos confirm it.

24
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:35,040
NVA troops moving down the Ho Chi Minh Trail,

25
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:39,480
south of the DMZ, near Quang Tri.

26
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,240
Now, they'll combine with Charlie

27
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:44,120
and try to hit us hard,

28
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:46,440
probably in several places at once.

29
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,400
Glad you could make it, Colonel.

30
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,200
Sorry, sir.

31
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,440
Strategic Air Command's putting everything it's got

32
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,440
in the air two days from now and will just clobber the hell out of them.

33
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,760
If we don't stop their movement,

34
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:03,760
or at least slow it down to a trickle,

35
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:06,160
our ground troops are going to take heavy casualties.

36
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,800
Now, our job remains the same,

37
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,640
fly alongside the bombers,

38
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,800
throw down your electronic smoke screens,

39
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,880
jam the missile radars.

40
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:18,600
Sir, why don't we put our surveillance aircraft up there first, sir?

41
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:21,840
Have them fly the same route the big boys are going to fly on their scheduled run.

42
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,400
Missile reaction can be recorded,

43
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:26,360
launch sites plotted.

44
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:29,320
Send the fighter jocks in there to just knock the hell out of them.

45
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:48,520
I really appreciate you volunteering us for this flight, Hamb.

46
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:51,240
Didn't think you had your sights set on being a full bird.

47
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,640
I've got my sights set on a condo

48
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:56,520
on the seventh fairway at Tucson National.

49
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:59,400
Six months from now, that's where the old lady and me will be.

50
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,800
That sounds awfully exciting(!)

51
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,800
You think that's exciting?

52
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,400
You should see the deck furniture.

53
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,560
Ha!

54
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:19,320
Mark. Start your music.

55
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,400
I've got a solid growl.

56
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,680
SAM on scope. I confirm a launch.

57
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,920
I got him.

58
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:34,400
Goddamn it. I didn't think they had SAMs this far south.

59
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,320
That's why we're here.

60
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:38,840
Have to go back and give them the bad news.

61
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,840
I've got another one.

62
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:42,680
SAM on scope. 2, salvo 3.

63
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:46,480
They're changing frequencies. I've got one.

64
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:49,400
Hold it steady. Got two.

65
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,240
- Got one visual.
- Break left!

66
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,400
Break left! LOUD BUZZING

67
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,960
It's tracking us! It's locked!

68
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:03,240
We're hit! Everybody get out!

69
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:05,360
We're going down!

70
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,400
We're burning up!

71
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:10,840
Hit by SAM! Mayday! Mayday!

72
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,760
I've lost it. Crew eject! Crew eject!

73
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,440
I can't get out!

74
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:17,080
Red Scout One hit by SAMs!

75
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,520
Punch out, Hamb!

76
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:19,960
Come on, Scotty! Let's get out!

77
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,360
Right behind you!

78
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,520
Mayday! Mayday!

79
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:35,480
Punch out, Scotty! Somebody punch out!

80
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:52,080

HAMBLETON ON RADIO: 02 FAC! 02, come in!

This is FAC 02, call sign Birddog.

87
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,040
Identify yourself.

88
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:16,680
Bat 21. I'm the parachute above you, one o'clock.

BEEPING

90
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:22,600
Have you in sight. Turn off your beeper, Bat 21,

91
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:25,360
or Charlie will get to you before the Jolly Greens.

92
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,600
Will advise. Happy landings.

93
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,080
Roger.

94
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,200
Bat 21, get out of that paddy!

95
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,600
Hooches to the south. Head north to the tree line.

96
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,480
Repeat, head north to the tree line.

97
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:27,480
Repeat, tree line north. Roger that?

98
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,880
Negative. I want to wait for the choppers.

99
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,240
Negative.

100
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:33,240
Let's get the basic relationship down here.

101
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:36,880
I'm the lifeguard. You're the drowning man.

102
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,240
If you relax, I can bring you to shore.

103
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,400
If you fight me, then I'll have to slap you around.

104
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,480
Now, get your ass in gear, mister!

105
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:55,600
Bat 21, Charlie's firing mortars from the south.

106
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,120
Advise at tree line. Repeat, advise at tree line.

107

PLANE APPROACHES

108
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:55,120
Birddog, this is Bat 21. I can't go any further.

109
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,640
Get the helis from this position.

110
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:59,560
- Copy, Bat 21.
- What about the others?

111
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:01,160
Anybody else make it out?

112
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,880
None reported. We're still looking.

113
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,840
Just stay calm.

114
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:08,240
I'll try.

115
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,360
Don't worry, Bat 21. We'll get you out.

116
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,520
But it's not going to happen today.

117
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:16,440
All choppers busy evac-ing fire base at Quang Tri.

118
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,840
Company of guns overrun by Charlie.

119
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:21,720
Jolly Greens will pick you up in the morning.

120
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:33,680
Say again, your last transmission.

121
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:37,960
Repeat, Jolly Greens will pick you up in the morning.

122
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:41,760
There will be no pick-up today. Copy, Bat 21?

123
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,760
EXPLOSIONS IN THE DISTANCE

124
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,080
I copy, Birddog.

125
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:49,040
OK, listen, Bat 21.

126
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:53,680
I'm running low on juice. Have to return to base.

127
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,680
Birddog, thanks for your help.

128
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:58,080
That's what I'm here for.

129
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:00,040
Birddog, you going to be back?

130
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,560
That's the plan.

131
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:05,040
Birddog signing off. Keep your head down. See you later.

132
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,320
Bat 21 out.

133
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,240
PLANE FADES INTO DISTANCE

134
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,920
THEY SPEAK IN VIETNAMESE

HE CHANTS

137
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:41,680
How was your flight, sir?

138
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:46,480
Same old shit, bad movies and terrible food.

139
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:50,640
Don't you, uh... don't you think

140
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:52,160
you're pushing it a little, Captain?

141
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:55,560
You've almost doubled the base record.

142
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,040
The base record? Sheesh!

143
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,920
I'll pin a medal on my chest(!)

144
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:01,320
Would you check my right aileron?

145
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:03,960
It's sticking a bit, OK?

146
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:09,040
Yeah, I got to replace it, sir.

147
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:11,440
How long will that take?

148
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:15,840
Well, I can borrow one from 453.

149
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:19,000
That's Anderson's ship.

150
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,800
The way he flies, Captain, he'll never miss it, sir.

151
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:26,480
Ha-ha-ha! I like your initiative, Sergeant.

152
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,200
Keep it up.

153
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:32,440
Well, we've pulled our share of pilots out of there,

154
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:34,840
but never a 53-year-old Lieutenant Colonel.

155
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:38,640
A 53-year-old Lieutenant Colonel?

156
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:41,640
That's right. Navigator on that EB.

157
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,400
They just gave me crew codes

158
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,360
and no names and ranks.

159
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:50,280
Well, I am told that Hambleton

160
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:51,680
is one of our top people.

161
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,560
He's an electronics countermeasure expert.

162
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:56,320
I am told that the Communists

163
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,640
will have a dossier on him that thick.

164
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:01,120
So, in the morning, when we get our birds back,

165
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,440
we're going to go in and get him.

166
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,120
Seventh Air Force does not want Charlie

167
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:06,000
getting their hands on him.

168
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,960
We'll get him tomorrow then, sir.

169
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,400
In the meantime, I want you

170
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:10,800
to go back out there tonight.

171
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,400
But he's not going anywhere, Colonel.

172
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:15,600
I know, because I'm going to make damn certain he's secure.

173
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,000
Then why don't you send Anderson?

174
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,440
Didn't he just get his pilot's licence?

175
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,840
You'd better watch it, Captain.

176
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:24,720
Look, sir, I'm tired, I'm two weeks short,

177
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,120
and that area is pretty hot,

178
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,000
and I don't want to get shot down

179
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,960
on some public-relations mission, OK?

180
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:38,600
All right, then, I'll make it easy for you, Captain.

181
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:41,400
It's an order, and you damn well will carry it out.

182
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,440
Is that clear?

183
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,800
Yes, sir.

184
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:55,000
Thank you for the ride, sir.

185
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,960
TWIG SNAPS

186
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:56,360
MEN SPEAK SOFTLY IN VIETNAMESE

187
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,240
BRANCH SNAPS

188
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:30,360
Phew! OK...

189
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:32,280
50 piasters.

190
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:33,720
THE OTHER MEN GROAN

191
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:35,640
Come on! Chickenshits! Chickenshits!

192
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,080
No way.

193
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:39,000
OK. Hey, Clarky, pull up a chair,

194
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,920
before these pigeons are totally penniless.

195
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:43,800
Another time. I got to go back up again tonight.

196
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,240
Going back up again?

197
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:47,160
Damn, putting in the hours.

198
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:48,600
Yeah. Tell Walker.

199
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:51,440
I got to start carrying my sleeping bag with me.

200
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,360
OK... I got two pair.

201
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,880
Three sixes.

202
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:58,640
I've got two pairs of sevens and your other six.

203
00:19:58,640 --> 00:19:59,960
Ha-ha-ha!

204
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:03,040
Damn! I thought you newspaper boys

205
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:05,600
would be a bit sharper than that. What rag do you write for again?

206
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,240
New York Times.

207
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:09,160
Oh, yeah, I picked one up once.

208
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:12,080
You read, Ross? Probably stole it from some derelict in the park,

209
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,520
who was using it as a blanket.

210
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:14,960
I gave him a nickel!

211
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:17,720
I couldn't find the comics, so I returned it.

212
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:19,280
Did you get your money back?

213
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,840
Yeah. I ended up finishing a pint of radiator fluid with the guy.

214
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,920
It was about then I figured it was time to enlist,

215
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:26,920
and here I am, the best goddamn evac pilot in 'Nam!

216
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:28,360
Tell it, Ross.

217
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:31,720
Flying those choppers every day scrambles up your brains. You get facts confused.

218
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:33,640
Ross here thinks that it takes some skill

219
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:35,560
to keep one of those eggbeaters up in the air.

220
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:36,920
Typical FAC pilot.

221
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:38,520
He labours under the misapprehension

222
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:40,840
that he is the most Sierra-Hotel cowboy in the Air Force.

223
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:42,320
The real truth is, he flies

224
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,200
a fucking VW Microbus with wings.

225
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:46,560
Well, this VW pilot

226
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:48,520
flies ten feet off the deck,

227
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:51,120
draws fire from SAMs down to eight-year-olds

228
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,560
with slingshots and pebbles.

229
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:55,640
Ha-ha-ha! A confirmation on that.

230
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:56,920
A lot of times, I've seen Clark

231
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:58,480
return here... You want one?

232
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:59,640
..with leaves in his teeth.

233
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:00,680
Because...

234
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:01,720
Two.

235
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:04,000
..us black folks ain't got no depth perception.

236
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,040
So we gots to fly what we gets.

237
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:07,680
MEN LAUGH

238
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:10,320
They won't let us fly fast aeroplanes!

239
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:13,880
You got to be particular in this man's Air Force.

240
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:18,320
Now, right here, you are looking at a perfect flyboy profile.

241
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:21,840
The kind of guy you can trust when the shit hits the fan.

242
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:24,720
Boom. It's hit the fan, man!

243
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,600
See you later, Clarky.

244
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:32,640
Later, Clarky.

245
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:35,920
Don't wait up for me, OK?

246
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,960
Take care.

247
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:46,560
PLANE FLIES OVERHEAD

248
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:53,720
Birddog, Bat 21. Is that you?

249
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:56,960
Roger, Bat 21. It's me.

250
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:00,880
I need a visual reference, so I can stay in range.

251
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,880
You'll need one.

252
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:26,120
Got you, Bat 21.

253
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:28,680
Positive contact.

254
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:38,320
I appreciate you dropping by, Birddog.

255
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40,720
That's what I'm here for.

256
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:46,120
Charlie walked by my hole about an hour ago.

257
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:47,920
How many?

258
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:52,720
10 or 12. It seems to be quiet now.

259
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,920
Just stay calm.

260
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:57,560
You'll be out of there in the morning.

261
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:02,320
Birddog, could you do me a personal favour?

262
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,240
Shoot.

263
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,160
Get in touch with my wife.

264
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:08,080
I was supposed to call her tonight.

265
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:10,200
She'll be scared to death.

266
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,880
Her name is Gwen.

267
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:13,800
I know. I pulled your personal file.

268
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,720
I got her address and number,

269
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:18,120
but I think you should let it ride for a day.

270
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:19,880
She may not be too excited

271
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,960
about where you decided to spend the night.

272
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:26,280
Yeah, we'll do it your way.

273
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:29,200
I'm glad somebody's thinking clearly.

274
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:32,040
How long you been flying Oscar-Deuces?

275
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:35,160
Too long. Due to rotate soon.

276
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:38,280
You know, I'm probably the oldest captain in the Air Force.

277
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:40,200
How old are you?

278
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:42,640
Would you believe, 35 in June?

279
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:46,400
Ha-ha-ha! That's not very old.

280
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:49,360
Shit. Sometimes, it is.

281
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,280
Are you married, Birddog?

282
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:56,000
Yeah.

283
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,800
Got a wife and kid back home.

284
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,920
I've been thinking about my old lady a lot

285
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,880
since I've been down here.

286
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:16,120
Funny how that works.

287
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:19,000
She keeps bugging me that my mind

288
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,360
is someplace else when I'm with her.

289
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:26,440
Yeah, yeah, I know what you mean.

290
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:29,560
Any news on the other crew members?

291
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:31,960
No. No other chutes were spotted.

292
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:33,920
We're still searching for the wreckage.

293
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:35,320
The jungle is hot.

294
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:37,720
Has anyone contacted Scott's wife?

295
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:41,120
Yeah. That's been taken care of.

296
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:43,040
THEY SPEAK VIETNAMESE

297
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,800
I feel like a real jerk.

298
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:50,680
I'm the big expert on this deal,

299
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:52,560
and I get us shot down.

300
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:56,760
Don't beat yourself up, Bat 21. It happens.

301
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:01,680
You OK for the night, Bat 21?

302
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:06,960
Yeah. No problem. Thanks for checking in.

303
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:09,360
Then I'm RTB.

304
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:11,320
Tuck yourself in.

305
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:14,320
Carpool will pick you up at first light.

306
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:18,440
This is Birddog signing off, Bat 21.

307
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:48,280
ENGINES IN DISTANCE

308
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:30,480
Birddog, Birddog, this is Bat 21.

309
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,360
Are you in the vicinity?

310
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:35,120
Roger, Bat 21.

311
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:38,080
Just about to give you a wake-up call.

312
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:40,400
Birddog, take a look at the intersection

313
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:42,320
of hollywood and vine. Rush-hour traffic.

314
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:44,720
Could be a problem for our Jolly Greens.

315
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:47,600
Roger, Bat 21. Stand by.

316
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,520
Let's put some hits on these guys.

317
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:52,600
I got a good visual. I'll call them.

318
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:56,040
You sure? You're pretty close to the action. You might get nicked.

319
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:57,640
I can see the crossroads from here.

320
00:27:57,640 --> 00:28:00,040
About half a click south of the rice paddy.

321
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:01,440
Mark it.

322
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:04,680
You pulling rank on me, Bat 21?

323
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:06,080
I'll take my chances.

324
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:07,640
You got it.

325
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:10,600
Here you go. Enjoy the show!

326
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:21,120
MEN SHOUTING/MACHINE GUNS FIRING

327
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:30,840
Birddog to Crabtree, I marked my targets. What are you hauling?

328
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:33,080
Roger, Birddog. This is Crabtree,

329
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:35,040
coming in from the south

330
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:37,160
with a full load of snake and nape.

331
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:39,840
Roger, Crabtree. You see my smoke?

332
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:41,760
Uh...affirmative, Birddog.

333
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,640
Waste the area, but remember,

334
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:45,560
we have a friendly in the vicinity.

335
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:48,800
Try not to ruin his day with a stray frag.

336
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:50,120
Don't worry, Birddog.

337
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:52,720
We can thread a needle if we have to.

338
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:56,160
Thread a needle, my ass. Shit. Ha-ha!

339
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,560
Birddog, on your next pass,

340
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:48,920
move just east of the intersection.

341
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:51,280
You got camouflaged tanks.

342
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:55,640
Roger, Bat 21.

343
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:58,520
Crabtree, tanks just east of intersection,

344
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:00,440
Missed on first pass.

345
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:03,320
Roger, Birddog.

346
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:05,200
MACHINE GUNS FIRE

347
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:36,080
We're Winchester, Birddog. Please assess damage.

348
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:38,400
Additional targets still appear active.

349
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:41,600
Copy, Crabtree. Return to base. Will advise.

350
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:47,080
MAN SHOUTS

351
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:57,640
GUNSHOT

352
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:17,640
Uh, Bat 21 from Birddog.

353
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:20,600
Uh, Bat 21?

354
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:24,000
Bat 21 from Birddog.

355
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,440
Do you copy, Bat 21?

356
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:30,200
Go, Birddog.

357
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,640
You intact?

358
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Affirmative.

359
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,400
Nice quarterbacking.

360
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:40,240
Maybe we ought to leave you in for the second half.

361
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:42,200
Negative. I've seen enough.

362
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:45,240
I guess it's different on the ground.

363
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:49,840
It's too damn close.

364
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:52,760
Bat 21, your pick-up may be delayed.

365
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:55,600
The area is still too hot.

366
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:58,520
Negative! Negative! It's got to be today, goddamn it!

367
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:01,800
I repeat, area's still too hot.

368
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:04,200
It's a war zone, goddamn it! What do you expect?!

369
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:07,600
Relax, Bat 21. We'll get you out at first light.

370
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:09,000
Jesus Christ!

371
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:13,400
Just stay calm. Birddog will deliver.

372
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:16,520
Negative, Birddog. Bat 21 has a plan.

373
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:17,840
I worked it out last night.

374
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:20,080
Birddog would like to RTB, refuel,

375
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:22,320
and confirm before you move.

376
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:24,960
Negative, Birddog. Not enough time.

377
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:35,400
Bat 21! Bat 21!

378
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:38,800
Birddog would like to confirm before you move.

379
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:42,600
Negative. Bat's on the move.

380
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:44,520
Heading for the swanee.

381
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:45,960
Swanee?

382
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:48,200
Repeat, heading for the swanee,

383
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:50,280
Like in the song. "Swanee, swanee.

384
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:52,200
"How I love you. How I love you."

385
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:53,800
Yeah, yeah, I know the song.

386
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:56,280
"Swanee, How I Love You."

387
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:01,640
Uh-huh. I think I broke the code, Bat 21.

388
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:03,240
But still do not advise.

389
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:05,280
Route takes you through too many unfriendlies.

390
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:07,080
Birddog has no way to track you.

391
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:09,920
I worked out a front nine to avoid the hazards.

392
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:13,640
Copy this. Add zero to yardage.

393
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:16,520
Holes three, six and eight at Shaw.

394
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:20,480
South one and 17 at Macdill.

395
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:24,800
Coming in on two, 12, 14, and 18 at Hickum.

396
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:26,240
How do you copy?

397
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:28,840
Copy, but I still don't know what the hell you're talking about.

398
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:36,320
Contact Colonel Douglass at Kerat Air Base for instructions.

399
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:40,160
I'm not sure this is a good idea, Bat 21.

400
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:45,280
Bat 21 is teeing off from the blue markers now. Out.

401
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:51,200
Uh, Bat 21, from Birddog.

402
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:55,000
Uh, Bat 21, Bat 21, from Birddog.

403
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,040
Bat... Oh, shit!

404
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:18,000
You want to tell me about it?

405
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,960
Hambleton's moving on me.

406
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:21,840
Where's he going?

407
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:25,000
I don't know. He gave me some kind of goddamned code,

408
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,600
after I decided it was too hot to pick him up.

409
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:30,680
- Yeah, I heard you brought in the flyboys.
- Mm-mmm...

410
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:33,280
That was his idea.

411
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:34,960
That's some kind of tough bastard.

412
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:36,240
Shit!

413
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:38,200
I mean, he must realise

414
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:40,080
they aren't always that accurate.

415
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:43,440
I've seen frags drop 30 feet in front of my windscreen.

416
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:44,880
Mm-hmm.

417
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:47,200
Wait, wait, wait. Where are you going?

418
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:49,960
Sit down and finish your beer. Sit down.

419
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:52,960
I got to go up again. I got to find him.

420
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:55,600
You're spending more time in the air than on Mother Earth.

421
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:57,120
You look like hell.

422
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:02,160
Well, I need the overtime.

423
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:05,000
You are going for a DFFC, aren't you?

424
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,920
A Distinguished Fucking Flying Cross.

425
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:10,800
Man, I must have vapour-locked, or something.

426
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:14,160
"FAC pilot saves Colonel!"

427
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:16,560
You're gearing up for the ceremony. A full dress parade,

428
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:18,960
a nice shiny medal to show the folks back home,

429
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:21,800
and a newfound respect in the military community.

430
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:24,400
Shit! Clarky, stick around. Come on.

431
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,960
We'll take a chopper up.

432
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:28,360
We'll shoot a few cows and have a barbecue. What do you say?

433
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:31,400
Ross, not tonight, yeah?

434
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:33,360
Don't you think you've got

435
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:36,000
a little obsessive behaviour going here?

436
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,240
Obsessive behaviour? Me, obsessive behaviour?

437
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:41,480
Man, I recall some of the crazy, lunatic shit

438
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:42,920
that you've done in your machine.

439
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:46,120
Maybe I like hauling those sorry dudes out of the bush.

440
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:49,360
Maybe I like to see their big, sloppy smiles when I drag them into the chopper,

441
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:53,280
because you just know they thought they were going to spend the rest of the war dodging punji sticks,

442
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:56,320
snakes, and gooks, and I hand them a camel and a candy bar,

443
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:59,680
and they smile like when they got laid for the first time.

444
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:02,080
I'm not into this death-and-destruction bullshit either,

445
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:03,680
or flying fucking medals.

446
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:08,240
You know, all I want to do is bring the old man back.

447
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:13,120
OK... Go on. Get him through the night.

448
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:16,520
I'll haul his ass out in the morning.

449
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:18,440
OK, Birddog?

450
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:25,800
CLUCKING

451
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:24,040
MAN SPEAKS IN VIETNAMESE

452
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:28,960
HE REPLIES IN VIETNAMESE

453
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:31,480
MAN SPEAKS ANGRILY

454
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:40,800
No, no, no, no. Look... Friend.

455
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:43,240
HE REPEATS THE SAME WORD IN VIETNAMESE

456
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:48,680
< Friend. Friend. MAN SHOUTS ANGRILY

457
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:15,520
GUNSHOT

458
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,240
Pa?

459
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:54,200
I'm sorry.

460
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:19,120
WOMAN SOBS SOFTLY

461
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:34,440
HE GROANS

462
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:54,800
HE SOBS

463
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:02,680
No, no, no. Number 14 at Hickum.

464
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:05,560
Right, Hickum.

465
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:08,360
Yeah, the par four across the water.

466
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:10,800
That's the one. Hold the phone a minute.

467
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:12,600
Uh, Captain,

468
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:15,600
Uh...number 14 at Hickum, 390 yards.

469
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:17,080
Draw it in.

470
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:19,000
Don't forget to add the zero.

471
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,400
Come here, Clark.

472
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:22,360
Colonel, that puts our puzzle together.

473
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:26,200
Now let's hope the damn thing works. ..Right.

474
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:29,080
Yeah, I will keep you abreast of everything.

475
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:30,520
Right, I will.

476
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:33,440
And thank you. Mm-hmm.

477
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:37,200
What have we got, sir?

478
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:41,040
I got a lot to tell you about your boy.

479
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:42,960
Seems like Hambleton was flying

480
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:46,320
a pave-penny mission for a major bombing strike, Captain.

481
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:48,240
He came up with the idea himself,

482
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:50,160
and then he volunteers to go.

483
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:52,080
Right man for the job and all that.

484
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:54,960
Sounds like to me he must have written the damn manuals.

485
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:56,880
Wouldn't Charlie like to get

486
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:59,280
their hands on him, open him up? Shit.

487
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:01,680
It doesn't get any better.

488
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:04,560
The strike was scheduled for 07:00 hours tomorrow.

489
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:06,480
Their objective, carpet-bomb

490
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:08,360
this crossroads where Hambleton is

491
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:11,840
and everything around it for 8 kilometres.

492
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:14,640
HE SIGHS

493
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:18,920
That's what he was talking about.

494
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:21,040
Exactly.

495
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:25,600
He won't make it.

496
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:29,320
They're going to blast the whole goddamn area, huh?

497
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:31,240
I'm fucking blowing my brains out

498
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:32,840
trying to get this motherfucker home,

499
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:34,760
and they're talking about carpet-bombing!

500
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:36,200
Goddamn it, Captain...

501
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:37,640
Now, wait a minute...

502
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:39,280
Shut up, goddamn it!

503
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:44,280
I bought us 24 hours.

504
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:46,720
That's the best I could do.

505
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:50,080
Had to put my ass on the line to get that.

506
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:53,000
I told Seventh Air we'd get him out of there.

507
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,640
That's exactly what we're going to do.

508
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:03,680
Nice work, Colonel.

509
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:05,600
Let's don't start jumping up and down,

510
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:08,320
throwing babies in the air yet, Captain.

511
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:10,240
We'd better wait and see

512
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:12,200
if Hambleton's code works.

513
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:14,760
Hmm. You got any ideas?

514
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:16,200
Douglass knew what Hambleton

515
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:18,920
was talking about right away.

516
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:20,800
I mean, they're both golf fanatics.

517
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:23,720
They play three times a week. Hambleton's got a four handicap.

518
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:26,160
With all that in mind, come here. I want to show you something.

519
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:27,520
..Thank you, Howard.

520
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:31,800
Now...stay with me, Captain.

521
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:33,760
This gets pretty wild.

522
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:38,160
Hambleton wants to get here to the river, to the swanee, right?

523
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:39,440
Well, how's he going to do that?

524
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:42,480
I mean, he's not about to just tear ass out through there

525
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:43,800
and lose contact with you.

526
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:44,840
Hell, he's dead meat.

527
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:47,200
On the other hand, he can't get on the radio

528
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:49,320
and tell you where he's going. Charlie's got VHF too.

529
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:52,400
So he gives you an imaginary nine holes of golf.

530
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:54,800
When you lay those nine holes over our map, Captain...

531
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:58,280
there's what they look like.

532
00:44:58,280 --> 00:45:00,640
Now we can track him,

533
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:02,520
now that we know where he is.

534
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:04,400
We know exactly where he comes out at the end

535
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:06,640
because he didn't pick those holes at random.

536
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:08,680
They come off three Air Force golf courses

537
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:10,360
he's played a hundred times,

538
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:12,040
knows them like the back of his hand.

539
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:13,560
Now, let's take these three

540
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:15,440
that come off Shaw Air Force base.

541
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:18,360
First hole, 410-yard par-four dogleg.

542
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:20,760
We add that zero Hambleton's talking about,

543
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:22,160
it reads 4,100 yards,

544
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:24,560
and the first green puts him right there.

545
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:26,480
Next green, here and here.

546
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:30,000
These two holes come off the front and back of Macdill.

547
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,760
These four finishing holes here,

548
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:33,320
according to Douglass,

549
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:34,800
are the holes Hambleton birdied

550
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:36,560
the last time he played Hickum

551
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:38,480
to shoot a one-under-par 71.

552
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:40,400
Pretty good score, huh? Ha-ha-ha!

553
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:43,040
Clever son of a bitch.

554
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:44,480
You play golf, Captain?

555
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:47,120
No, sir. Golf wasn't big in my neighbourhood.

556
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:50,000
All right. Well, all these holes are on these cards,

557
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,880
and this is a glossary of golf terminology.

558
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:55,720
Now, you're going to communicate with Hambleton

559
00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:57,760
using these terms, because Charlie won't know

560
00:45:57,760 --> 00:45:59,560
what in the hell you're talking about

561
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:01,040
until it's too late, anyway.

562
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:03,400
So get busy. Learn this.

563
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:06,320
That's the key to Hambleton's code.

564
00:46:09,640 --> 00:46:11,560
Dogleg.

565
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:14,000
Dogleg.

566
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:16,440
Hmm.

567
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:24,880
Does Anderson know you borrowed his prop?

568
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:25,920
No, sir.

569
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:27,800
I'd love to be there when he tries to take off.

570
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:30,600
He's going to need a hell of a long runway, Captain.

571
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:31,720
Yeah.

572
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:34,360
Look, at the risk of being out of line, sir,

573
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:35,960
I think you look a bit overextended.

574
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:39,200
Now, in the best interest of the mission and your personal safety,

575
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:40,600
I put together this tape.

576
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:42,240
Some serious sounds, Captain.

577
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:44,800
They're guaranteed to keep you alert.

578
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:48,000
You're quite a man, Rumbaugh.

579
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:51,560
You just have a good flight, all right, sir?

580
00:47:51,560 --> 00:47:53,040
All right.

Come in, come in. Where the hell are you?

597
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:13,400
It's good to hear your voice, Birddog.

598
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:15,280
I'm at the third fairway,

599
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:17,280
trying to get a fix on your position.

600
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:18,720
You broke the code.

601
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:21,600
I'm working on it. It's not an easy game to play.

602
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:23,320
Uh, what is your...

603
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,040
..lie?

604
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:31,640
Birddog, I'm 150 yards northwest of the third green.

605
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:35,520
I'll give you a signal, white one.

606
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,640
Got you marked.

607
00:50:52,040 --> 00:50:53,240
Any problems?

608
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:56,080
I ran into an unfriendly a while back.

609
00:50:56,080 --> 00:50:58,480
I had to do some backtracking.

610
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:00,400
You all right?

611
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:02,480
My landing gear's a little damaged,

612
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:04,200
but it's still serviceable.

613
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:07,440
I'm sorry to hear about that.

614
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:12,400
Listen, Birddog...

615
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:15,280
you got to get me out of here.

616
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:17,080
Affirmative.

617
00:51:17,080 --> 00:51:19,160
I'm here to tell you the good news.

618
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:21,960
We bought 24 hours. Copy that?

619
00:51:21,960 --> 00:51:24,600
You bet I copy.

620
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:26,480
You must have friends in high places

621
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:28,240
who want to see your face again.

622
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:30,600
That's nice to know.

623
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:33,320
Uh, Bat 21...

624
00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:35,120
stay put and don't transmit.

625
00:51:35,120 --> 00:51:37,240
I have business to take care of.

626
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:43,600
Uh, this is Birddog. This is Birddog.

627
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:46,880

00:51:55,600 --> 00:51:58,000

Back to you, Bat 21. This is Birddog.

00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:12,400
Birddog...

636
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:17,240
..I killed a man today.

637
00:52:19,080 --> 00:52:21,600
Uh... Roger that.

638
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:26,000
He wasn't even a soldier.

639
00:52:27,560 --> 00:52:29,800
He just kept coming.

640
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:31,760
I couldn't stop him.

641
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:37,320
Uh...I understand.

642
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:42,800
I didn't want to do it.

643
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:45,480
I never had to do anything like that before in my life.

644
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:48,800
I've always been sitting in an airplane

645
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:52,520
at 30,000 feet with a cup of coffee in front of me.

646
00:52:54,640 --> 00:52:56,840
Look here, Bat 21, I never met you,

647
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:58,400
but you don't sound like a killer.

648
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:00,800
I'm sure you couldn't stop it from happening.

649
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:04,040
Now, the important thing is to put it behind you.

650
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:08,160
EXPLOSION

651
00:53:09,880 --> 00:53:11,800
What the hell's going on, Birddog?

652
00:53:11,800 --> 00:53:15,160
There's too many unfriendly foursomes in your vicinity.

654
00:53:17,560 --> 00:53:19,000
MORE EXPLOSIONS

655
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:20,920
JETS PASS OVERHEAD

656
00:53:20,920 --> 00:53:25,760
Jesus Christ! Does it ever stop?

657
00:53:27,160 --> 00:53:29,560
Are you with me, Bat 21?

658
00:53:29,560 --> 00:53:31,960
Yeah, Birddog, I'm here.

659
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:33,600
All right.

660
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:35,800
I want you to listen real hard.

661
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:38,200
I know you're hurting, but we have to deal with

662
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:40,120
getting you back to the clubhouse.

663
00:53:40,120 --> 00:53:43,080
We're going to pick you up at first light.

664
00:53:43,080 --> 00:53:44,880
Damn, I'm ready.

665
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:46,320
JET PASSES OVERHEAD

666
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:49,200
I want you to play the fourth hole tonight.

667
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:51,640
The green will be our LZ.

668
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:56,400
That's a long goddamn hole.

669
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:58,320
Yeah. There's a few hazards,

670
00:53:58,320 --> 00:54:00,280
but the green is safe.

671
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:02,640
EXPLOSIONS CONTINUE

672
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:05,560
Think you can make it, Bat 21?

673
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,840
Yeah, I should be able to play through.

674
00:54:09,840 --> 00:54:12,440
Looking forward to buying you a drink.

675
00:54:12,440 --> 00:54:15,640
I'll start the tab.

676
00:54:15,640 --> 00:54:17,480
Roger that.

677
00:54:17,480 --> 00:54:19,200
Birddog signing off.

678
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:20,720
I'll see you in the morning.

679
00:56:15,480 --> 00:56:18,840
Uh, Bat 21, this is Birddog. Come in.

680
00:56:22,680 --> 00:56:25,080
Birddog, Bat 21. Go ahead.

681
00:56:25,080 --> 00:56:27,480
Are you still on course?

682
00:56:29,840 --> 00:56:32,720
Birddog, yeah, I'm an easy chip shot

683
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:34,160
from the green,

684
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:37,600
except that there's a village right here in front of me.

685
00:56:37,600 --> 00:56:39,920
Reconned yesterday. Area's safe.

686
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:41,880
We'll take another look.

687
00:56:41,880 --> 00:56:44,760
OK, Birddog.

688
00:56:55,960 --> 00:56:57,680
Shine up your medal, Clarky,

689
00:56:57,680 --> 00:56:59,280
I'm bringing back your boy.

690
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:03,040
I'll personally alert Bat 21.

691
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:07,400
Bat 21, this is Birddog again. Come in.

692
00:57:07,400 --> 00:57:09,560
Yeah, Birddog, I'm still here.

693
00:57:09,560 --> 00:57:11,960
Not for long. I'm sending in my best man.

694
00:57:11,960 --> 00:57:13,920
Get your flares ready, and don't pop the smoke

695
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:17,720
until you hear from Jolly Greens. Understand?

696
00:57:17,720 --> 00:57:19,680
Roger, Birddog.

697
00:57:29,720 --> 00:57:34,040
- WALKER:
- Bat 21, Cobra Leader. Do you copy?

698
00:57:35,480 --> 00:57:37,120
Go ahead.

699
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:39,760
We'll come over your position from the north.

700
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:42,240
Be ready to pop those flares.

701
00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:44,680
I've been ready for two days.

702
00:58:04,120 --> 00:58:06,240
Hold what you got, Big Sky.

703
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:09,040
I'm going to send Birddog in to take a look.

704
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:11,120
Roger.

705
00:58:24,920 --> 00:58:27,000
Talk to me, Birddog.

706
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,360
Looks quiet.

707
00:58:29,360 --> 00:58:33,040
I'm going in for a closer look.

708
00:58:33,040 --> 00:58:36,360
Here we go. Be right back.

709
00:58:55,400 --> 00:58:58,440
It don't look like anybody's home.

710
00:59:11,480 --> 00:59:14,800
All right, Big Sky, go get him.

711
00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:17,080
I'll cover your tail.

712
00:59:27,640 --> 00:59:29,200
Jolly Green from Birddog.

713
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:31,640
You're looking good, looking good.

714
00:59:31,640 --> 00:59:34,400
Coming in on your LZ.

715
00:59:41,240 --> 00:59:43,840
SHOUTING IN VIETNAMESE

716
00:59:51,400 --> 00:59:53,080
Shit! We're taking hits.

717
00:59:55,080 --> 00:59:57,680
The village is hot! The village is hot!

718
00:59:57,680 --> 01:00:00,840
Birddog, there's at least two machine guns in the village!

719
01:00:00,840 --> 01:00:04,480
I thought you said that goddamn LZ was secure!

720
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:07,480
Get back in the trees, Bat 21. Back in the trees!

721
01:00:17,240 --> 01:00:19,440
Stevie, open up.

722
01:00:37,960 --> 01:00:39,640
Get those mines ready.

723
01:00:39,640 --> 01:00:41,960
We're going to drop them right here in this paddy.

724
01:00:41,960 --> 01:00:43,680
Keep them away from Bat 21.

725
01:00:59,880 --> 01:01:02,040
Drop those mines!

726
01:01:10,720 --> 01:01:12,600
Son of a bitch!

727
01:01:16,560 --> 01:01:19,480
Big Sky, get the hell out of there.

728
01:01:19,480 --> 01:01:21,960
I'm coming back. Open up, Steven.

729
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:26,680
Get on those guns and give them hell.

730
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:38,480
Agh!

731
01:01:38,480 --> 01:01:40,560
Son of a bitch! He's hit!

732
01:01:40,560 --> 01:01:43,160
Take care of him. Hendricks, get on the gun!

733
01:01:43,160 --> 01:01:44,880
We're going to fix you up.

734
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:47,240
Big Sky, abort mission.

735
01:01:47,240 --> 01:01:50,200
Repeat, abort! Abort!

736
01:01:51,760 --> 01:01:54,480
Boys, they're not going to stick a fork in me till I'm done.

737
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:55,880
We're going to get that boy.

738
01:01:55,880 --> 01:01:58,440
Abort mission, Big Sky! Get the hell out of there, Ross!

739
01:01:58,440 --> 01:02:00,680
Sorry. Transmission is breaking up.

740
01:02:00,680 --> 01:02:02,760
Repeat, abort!

741
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:05,320
Sorry. Transmission is breaking up.

742
01:02:05,320 --> 01:02:07,920
That's bullshit! You heard me!

743
01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:09,960
I said abort!

744
01:02:16,600 --> 01:02:19,960
Fuck it. Let's go in.

745
01:02:23,880 --> 01:02:26,320
Come on, you...

746
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,160
Ross, get out of there!

747
01:02:40,680 --> 01:02:42,320
Son of a bitch!

748
01:02:42,320 --> 01:02:46,440
He's hit! Birddog, he's hit!

749
01:02:46,440 --> 01:02:48,200
Shit!

750
01:02:50,480 --> 01:02:53,480
Shit! I'm losing it!

751
01:03:04,920 --> 01:03:07,800
Up, Big Sky! Big Rocks! Pull out!

752
01:03:07,800 --> 01:03:09,280
Shit. We're going down.

753
01:03:09,280 --> 01:03:11,920
We're going down. Mayday! Mayday!

754
01:03:18,600 --> 01:03:21,840
I can't see a goddamn thing, goddamn it!

755
01:03:21,840 --> 01:03:24,200
We're going down. Mayday.

756
01:03:48,880 --> 01:03:50,520
HE COUGHS

757
01:03:50,520 --> 01:03:52,000
Start, motherfucker!

758
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:53,880
MEN SHOUT

759
01:03:53,880 --> 01:03:54,920
Start!

760
01:03:54,920 --> 01:03:56,680
Let's get out of here, Ross!

761
01:03:56,680 --> 01:03:59,480
Fuck! They're coming!

762
01:03:59,480 --> 01:04:02,080
The gun jammed! Let's go, Ross! Come on!

763
01:04:02,080 --> 01:04:05,600
Goddamn it! Let's fucking go!

764
01:04:05,600 --> 01:04:08,280
Start! Shit.

765
01:04:08,280 --> 01:04:10,680
Start!

766
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:12,320
Shit.

767
01:04:12,320 --> 01:04:15,320
Come on, Pearson. We got to get out of here.

768
01:04:15,320 --> 01:04:16,800
Come on, Ross! Jesus! The gun!

769
01:04:16,800 --> 01:04:19,280
Come on! We got to get out of here!

770
01:04:19,280 --> 01:04:21,000
Goddamn it, come on!

771
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:22,800
GUNFIRE

772
01:04:22,800 --> 01:04:24,600
Agh!

773
01:04:24,600 --> 01:04:26,840
Get up, man! We got to go!

774
01:04:26,840 --> 01:04:28,920
Aah!

775
01:04:34,120 --> 01:04:38,400
Finley, goddamn it! Give me the gun!

776
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:40,880
Shit! Come on, give me the gun, Finley!

777
01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:43,800
Give me the goddamn gun, goddamn it!

778
01:04:43,800 --> 01:04:47,000
Jesus Christ! Don't shoot!

779
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:49,720
Don't shoot!

780
01:04:49,720 --> 01:04:52,000
Don't shoot! Holy shit!

781
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:55,240
I'm fuckin' hit, man!

782
01:04:55,240 --> 01:04:57,200
Jesus Christ!

783
01:04:57,200 --> 01:04:59,120
Oh, God!

784
01:04:59,120 --> 01:05:04,000
Steve, stay alive! Someone will be back.

785
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,200
Don't fuckin' leave us, Ross!

786
01:05:06,200 --> 01:05:09,720
Just stay alive, goddamn it!

787
01:05:09,720 --> 01:05:12,280
SHOUTING IN VIETNAMESE

788
01:05:16,680 --> 01:05:18,240
Don't leave us, Ross!

789
01:05:18,240 --> 01:05:20,600
Don't worry. I'll be back.

790
01:05:20,600 --> 01:05:23,320
All right!

791
01:05:23,320 --> 01:05:25,440
SHOUTING CONTINUES

792
01:05:28,040 --> 01:05:30,200
Ross! Ross!

793
01:05:30,200 --> 01:05:32,640
GUNFIRE

794
01:05:32,640 --> 01:05:35,000
Goddamn you!

795
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:27,200
Birddog, they've got two of our men.

796
01:06:27,200 --> 01:06:30,120
I think the rest of the crew is dead.

797
01:06:30,120 --> 01:06:32,040
Uh, copy, Bat 21. Stand by.

798
01:06:32,040 --> 01:06:34,080
Cobra Leader, Charlie has two of our airmen.

799
01:06:34,080 --> 01:06:35,880
Can you identify?

800
01:06:35,880 --> 01:06:39,240
Negative, Birddog. Can't make out from here.

801
01:06:39,240 --> 01:06:41,640
We're holding our fire.

802
01:06:41,640 --> 01:06:45,320
They shot my damn hydraulics out.

803
01:06:45,320 --> 01:06:48,880
I'm not going to be able to put this thing down here.

804
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:50,760
I'm going down for a closer look.

805
01:06:50,760 --> 01:06:52,200
Not advisable, Birddog.

806
01:06:52,200 --> 01:06:54,280
It will be a quick pass.

807
01:06:59,640 --> 01:07:02,560
GUNFIRE

808
01:07:05,320 --> 01:07:06,920
Confirmed, two airmen.

809
01:07:06,920 --> 01:07:09,080
One is pilot.

810
01:07:19,120 --> 01:07:21,080
THEY SPEAK IN VIETNAMESE

811
01:07:23,320 --> 01:07:25,840
You know what, Charlie? I don't follow your fucking drift.

812
01:07:25,840 --> 01:07:28,240
I took Spanish in school. No comprendo.

813
01:07:28,240 --> 01:07:30,400
HE SHOUTS IN VIETNAMESE

814
01:07:30,400 --> 01:07:34,480
Get your fucking slimy fucking hands off me!

815
01:07:36,840 --> 01:07:40,560
I don't know what the fuck you're talking about!

816
01:07:40,560 --> 01:07:43,080
I don't understand you.

817
01:07:43,080 --> 01:07:47,280
Birddog, they're trying to get him to tell where I am.

818
01:07:47,280 --> 01:07:49,840
Copy, Bat 21. Just stay low.

819
01:08:01,440 --> 01:08:03,400
GUNSHOT

820
01:08:03,400 --> 01:08:05,680
Bastard! Motherfucker!

821
01:08:19,040 --> 01:08:21,520
They just killed one of our men.

822
01:08:21,520 --> 01:08:24,200
Was it the pilot, Bat 21?

823
01:08:24,200 --> 01:08:26,760
I don't think so. It's me they want.

824
01:08:26,760 --> 01:08:28,920
I'm going to give myself up.

825
01:08:28,920 --> 01:08:31,680
Keep your ass down, Bat 21! Charlie doesn't bargain.

826
01:08:31,680 --> 01:08:33,440
Nothing you can do about it.

827
01:08:33,440 --> 01:08:36,400
Now, retreat double-time back into the trees.

828
01:09:00,200 --> 01:09:01,480
Come on, fella. Come closer.

829
01:09:01,480 --> 01:09:03,680
Come on. Come on, you motherfucker.

830
01:09:03,680 --> 01:09:05,600
Come on.

831
01:09:05,600 --> 01:09:07,520
Oh!

832
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:09,000
HE IMITATES AN EXPLOSION

833
01:09:10,400 --> 01:09:11,880
Come on.

834
01:09:11,880 --> 01:09:14,680
They're walking him out into the minefield.

835
01:09:14,680 --> 01:09:16,640
Ah, Jesus!

836
01:09:19,960 --> 01:09:21,920
Come on!

837
01:09:59,760 --> 01:10:02,640
Hey, come on!

838
01:10:02,640 --> 01:10:03,680
Agh!

839
01:10:05,040 --> 01:10:07,400
ROSS SCREAMS

840
01:10:07,400 --> 01:10:10,920
Aah! Aah!

841
01:10:12,920 --> 01:10:14,120
Goddamn it!

842
01:10:23,360 --> 01:10:26,440
Aah!

843
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:41,960
Motherfucker!

844
01:10:43,960 --> 01:10:47,000
You lowlife...

845
01:11:02,720 --> 01:11:06,880
I've got enough dead heroes for one day, Clark!

846
01:11:06,880 --> 01:11:09,280
Get your ass out of there!

847
01:11:09,280 --> 01:11:11,480
Oh, fuck.

848
01:11:17,160 --> 01:11:19,840
You'll get Bat 21 back on the course!

849
01:11:19,840 --> 01:11:24,320
Then rendezvous with me at Hilo-1-8-5.

850
01:11:24,320 --> 01:11:27,280
I'm going to waste this whole goddamned area!

851
01:11:37,280 --> 01:11:42,080
Four-square leader, hustle your ass over here.

852
01:11:42,080 --> 01:11:45,760
One click north of Hilo-1-niner-6.

853
01:11:45,760 --> 01:11:48,160
Gun emplacement in village.

854
01:11:48,160 --> 01:11:52,440
Jolly Green down. Crew is dead.

855
01:11:52,440 --> 01:11:55,440
Look for the smoke.

856
01:11:59,600 --> 01:12:01,560
People are still in the village.

857
01:12:01,560 --> 01:12:03,480
Charlie is using them for cover.

858
01:12:03,480 --> 01:12:05,880
Stay off frequency, Bat 21.

859
01:12:05,880 --> 01:12:08,240
Await instructions from Birddog.

860
01:12:14,520 --> 01:12:18,360
Birddog. Birddog, people are in the village.

861
01:12:18,360 --> 01:12:22,040
Repeat, civilians, women and children, in the village.

862
01:12:22,040 --> 01:12:24,640
That's a confirmation. Will advise.

863
01:12:26,520 --> 01:12:29,160
Cobra Leader, this is Birddog.

864
01:12:29,160 --> 01:12:30,680
Village is still not clear.

865
01:12:30,680 --> 01:12:32,200
Civilians still in area.

866
01:12:32,200 --> 01:12:34,840
Stay off frequency.

867
01:12:34,840 --> 01:12:37,040
Delay the strike. Repeat, delay strike.

868
01:12:37,040 --> 01:12:40,320
Bat 21, get back on course.

869
01:12:40,320 --> 01:12:42,040
Will connect with you at swanee.

870
01:12:42,040 --> 01:12:44,960
Fuck the goddamn swanee. Delay the strike!

871
01:12:44,960 --> 01:12:46,640
That was my friend laying in the mud

872
01:12:46,640 --> 01:12:48,400
with his fucking head blown off!

873
01:12:48,400 --> 01:12:49,800
Now, get back on course!

874
01:12:49,800 --> 01:12:52,440
Now, do as I say! Back on course!

875
01:13:52,320 --> 01:13:55,240
People keep dying all around me.

876
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,440
I'm through killing.

877
01:14:03,840 --> 01:14:06,280
I'm through, goddamn it.

878
01:14:51,800 --> 01:14:53,280
HE SIGHS

879
01:14:56,120 --> 01:14:58,200
You called for me, sir?

880
01:15:01,840 --> 01:15:03,320
Ahem...

881
01:15:03,320 --> 01:15:05,720
Lost six people today, Clark.

882
01:15:05,720 --> 01:15:08,240
Kids, all of them, just kids.

883
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:12,320
And I couldn't guarantee

884
01:15:12,320 --> 01:15:13,800
we'd get him out of there

885
01:15:13,800 --> 01:15:15,560
if we had another week. Damn it, it's too hot.

886
01:15:15,560 --> 01:15:18,600
HE SIGHS

887
01:15:18,600 --> 01:15:21,960
So, the strike is a go...

888
01:15:21,960 --> 01:15:24,360
07:00 hours tomorrow.

889
01:15:24,360 --> 01:15:27,240
They're going to level the whole area.

890
01:15:27,240 --> 01:15:29,640
All we can do is hope and pray to God

891
01:15:29,640 --> 01:15:32,520
Hambleton makes it to the river.

892
01:15:32,520 --> 01:15:34,400
I, uh...

893
01:15:34,400 --> 01:15:37,280
Did I ever call the Navy,

894
01:15:37,280 --> 01:15:39,720
and, uh, they're going to send

895
01:15:39,720 --> 01:15:41,720
a patrol boat up there.

896
01:15:43,560 --> 01:15:45,520
Where are you headed?

897
01:15:46,920 --> 01:15:49,600
I'm going to help him make it to the river, sir.

898
01:15:51,080 --> 01:15:53,120
Planes are grounded, Clark.

899
01:15:53,120 --> 01:15:55,840
We are not to go back in there

900
01:15:55,840 --> 01:15:57,640
until the strike is over.

901
01:15:59,040 --> 01:16:01,760
Our hands are tied.

902
01:16:01,760 --> 01:16:03,720
Yes, sir.

903
01:16:16,160 --> 01:16:17,640
HE SIGHS

904
01:17:02,160 --> 01:17:05,080
Birddog, Bat 21. Over.

905
01:17:06,960 --> 01:17:10,320
Birddog, Bat 21. How do you read? Over.

906
01:17:10,320 --> 01:17:13,680
'Birddog, this is Bat 21. Come in.

907
01:17:13,680 --> 01:17:16,560
'I'm on the sixth hole, Birddog. Do you copy?

908
01:17:16,560 --> 01:17:19,000
'Birddog, this is Bat 21.

909
01:17:20,400 --> 01:17:22,400
'Come in, Birddog.'

910
01:18:25,600 --> 01:18:27,040
Thank you.

911
01:18:42,880 --> 01:18:44,520
For me?

912
01:18:47,160 --> 01:18:49,160
BOY SPEAKS IN VIETNAMESE

913
01:21:02,920 --> 01:21:06,240
Definitely not a good idea, sir. It's a bad idea.

914
01:21:06,240 --> 01:21:08,160
I trained in one of these things 15 years ago.

915
01:21:08,160 --> 01:21:10,120
So, just refresh my memory.

916
01:21:10,120 --> 01:21:11,600
You got three minutes.

917
01:21:14,920 --> 01:21:16,800
Let's go, Rumbaugh.

918
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:18,160
All right.

919
01:21:18,160 --> 01:21:19,280
OK.

920
01:21:19,280 --> 01:21:21,600
This is your rotor speed. Keep it in the green.

921
01:21:21,600 --> 01:21:23,040
This is your engine speed.

922
01:21:23,040 --> 01:21:24,520
Keep it also in the green.

923
01:21:24,520 --> 01:21:26,360
Red-line and you crash and burn.

924
01:21:26,360 --> 01:21:28,760
All right, pedals. Pedals work the same as your ship.

925
01:21:28,760 --> 01:21:30,720
The stick does not. It's cyclic.

926
01:21:30,720 --> 01:21:32,800
It controls the angles of your blades, all right?

927
01:21:32,800 --> 01:21:35,520
I can't believe you're taking the old man's ship.

928
01:21:35,520 --> 01:21:38,200
All right, power. Power's controlled by your collective.

929
01:21:38,200 --> 01:21:39,680
One thing you may have forgotten is,

930
01:21:39,680 --> 01:21:42,200
when you increase power, you increase left pedal

931
01:21:42,200 --> 01:21:45,560
to compensate for increased torque. Got it?

932
01:21:45,560 --> 01:21:49,400
Yeah, um...yeah, it's coming back to me.

933
01:21:49,400 --> 01:21:52,000
And what about autorotation?

934
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:53,840
Why? You planning on not coming back, sir?

935
01:21:53,840 --> 01:21:56,600
Tell me anyway.

936
01:21:56,600 --> 01:22:00,120
All right. Your engine quits.

937
01:22:00,120 --> 01:22:01,360
You're falling out of the sky.

938
01:22:01,360 --> 01:22:05,320
Now, all you've got left is the energy stored in your blades, OK?

939
01:22:05,320 --> 01:22:06,920
Push the left...

940
01:22:06,920 --> 01:22:10,120
No, push the right, the right pedal to the floor,

941
01:22:10,120 --> 01:22:11,840
collective down,

942
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:13,960
keep your rotor speed in the green.

943
01:22:13,960 --> 01:22:17,840
Keep it at about 80 knots and about 100 feet off the deck.

944
01:22:17,840 --> 01:22:20,640
Begin to flare and then cushion it on down with the collective.

945
01:22:20,640 --> 01:22:23,040
Now, you may start to spin,

946
01:22:23,040 --> 01:22:25,280
but that's cool. Don't panic.

947
01:22:25,280 --> 01:22:27,400
Key point being, he who hesitates...

948
01:22:27,400 --> 01:22:29,320
You don't want to hesitate, all right?

949
01:22:29,320 --> 01:22:30,760
All right.

950
01:22:30,760 --> 01:22:33,600
Here's your checklist, your maps, all your golf shit.

951
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:35,040
All right.

952
01:22:35,040 --> 01:22:36,480
Now, you got everything, right?

953
01:22:36,480 --> 01:22:38,040
You understand all this?

954
01:22:38,040 --> 01:22:39,080
Yeah.

955
01:22:39,080 --> 01:22:40,320
All right.

956
01:22:40,320 --> 01:22:41,760
Thanks for the lesson.

957
01:22:41,760 --> 01:22:42,920
Just come back, all right?

958
01:22:58,720 --> 01:23:01,080
Pedals! Pedals!

959
01:23:03,440 --> 01:23:05,280
Collective!

960
01:23:05,280 --> 01:23:07,160
Shit!

961
01:23:07,160 --> 01:23:09,480
Up! Up! Up!

962
01:23:11,240 --> 01:23:15,760
OK, all right. Torque, torque, torque.

963
01:23:18,240 --> 01:23:20,000
Get it up!

964
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:23,520
You got it! You got it! Up!

965
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:38,840
Who's that crazy son of a bitch?! Is that Clark?!

966
01:23:38,840 --> 01:23:41,080
I believe it is, sir.

967
01:23:41,080 --> 01:23:44,040
All right, Captain!

968
01:23:44,040 --> 01:23:46,640
We're looking at a court-martial now!

969
01:23:46,640 --> 01:23:48,560
Rotor speed up.

970
01:23:48,560 --> 01:23:50,640
Throttle friction.

971
01:23:53,440 --> 01:23:56,240
Jesus Christ!

972
01:23:56,240 --> 01:23:58,640
When he gets back here, Sergeant,

973
01:23:58,640 --> 01:24:00,560
I'm throwing his ass in the stockade!

974
01:24:00,560 --> 01:24:02,320
We don't have a stockade, sir.

975
01:24:02,320 --> 01:24:04,240
I'll build one!

976
01:24:04,240 --> 01:24:06,680
Son of a bitch!

977
01:24:15,040 --> 01:24:16,480
Good luck, Captain.

978
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:35,080
All right, all right, all right, here I come.

979
01:25:14,240 --> 01:25:16,640
Chopper Pilot, this is Bat 21.

980
01:25:16,640 --> 01:25:18,080
This is Chopper Pilot,

981
01:25:18,080 --> 01:25:20,440
above your signal on the ninth hole.

982
01:25:20,440 --> 01:25:21,920
Is that you, Birddog?

983
01:25:21,920 --> 01:25:23,440
Yeah, it's me.

984
01:25:23,440 --> 01:25:25,240
Now, let's get you out of here.

985
01:25:25,240 --> 01:25:27,640
50 metres east of you, there's a small field.

986
01:25:27,640 --> 01:25:30,120
If I can get into it, I can make it happen.

987
01:25:30,120 --> 01:25:32,000
Copy that, Bat 21?

988
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,440
I'm on my way, Birddog.

989
01:26:21,440 --> 01:26:25,600
THEY SPEAK IN VIETNAMESE

990
01:26:52,040 --> 01:26:53,880
Down!

991
01:27:10,480 --> 01:27:11,800
- Let's go!
- OK!

992
01:27:22,640 --> 01:27:23,680
Hey!

993
01:27:23,680 --> 01:27:25,280
Hang on!

994
01:27:38,080 --> 01:27:39,600
Hurry up.

995
01:27:47,240 --> 01:27:49,400
All right!

996
01:27:54,280 --> 01:27:56,880
I'm glad to see you, Birddog.

997
01:27:59,600 --> 01:28:02,440
Have a seat, Bat 21.

998
01:28:07,840 --> 01:28:10,560
You'd better check the charts.

999
01:28:10,560 --> 01:28:13,160
I had a hell of a time navigating here.

1000
01:28:15,960 --> 01:28:18,480
GUNFIRE

1001
01:28:18,480 --> 01:28:19,880
Jesus!

1002
01:28:23,640 --> 01:28:25,400
Shit!

1003
01:28:30,240 --> 01:28:33,160
You're losing oil pressure.

1004
01:28:33,160 --> 01:28:35,000
Jesus.

1005
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:41,120
There's the river.

1006
01:28:41,120 --> 01:28:42,680
We got to make it from here.

1007
01:28:42,680 --> 01:28:45,520
I'm going to have to put this baby down, OK?

1008
01:28:48,120 --> 01:28:50,680
There's a clearing at 9 o'clock.

1009
01:29:25,040 --> 01:29:27,680
Cut into the woods!

1010
01:29:29,480 --> 01:29:31,480
GUNFIRE

1011
01:29:38,840 --> 01:29:40,440
Let's go!

1012
01:29:58,600 --> 01:30:01,000
It's the air strike.

1013
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:04,280
It's right on time.

1014
01:30:04,280 --> 01:30:05,320
Jesus!

1015
01:30:06,960 --> 01:30:08,720
SHOUTING IN VIETNAMESE

1016
01:30:14,920 --> 01:30:17,680
Go! Move!

1017
01:31:26,240 --> 01:31:28,360
Oh, shit! Goddamn!

1018
01:33:16,160 --> 01:33:17,640
COUGHING

1019
01:34:11,800 --> 01:34:15,640
You know, I've been in the service...

1020
01:34:15,640 --> 01:34:18,080
most of my adult life.

1021
01:34:20,880 --> 01:34:23,320
It's the first time I ever saw any war.

1022
01:34:24,720 --> 01:34:28,600
Guess I was a little closer to the action.

1023
01:34:28,600 --> 01:34:30,040
Aah...

1024
01:34:30,040 --> 01:34:34,840
I've wanted to be a fighter pilot since I was a kid.

1025
01:34:34,840 --> 01:34:37,840
But they wouldn't let me out of the O-2.

1026
01:34:39,360 --> 01:34:40,640
Lucky for me.

1027
01:34:46,280 --> 01:34:49,240
You could have quit anytime.

1028
01:34:50,640 --> 01:34:52,560
Why'd you keep coming back?

1029
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:56,840
Guess it's the stubborn side of me.

1030
01:34:56,840 --> 01:34:59,760
I started out just doing my job,

1031
01:34:59,760 --> 01:35:01,680
no different from you.

1032
01:35:03,080 --> 01:35:05,680
I hate being told I can't do something.

1033
01:35:05,680 --> 01:35:09,400
I guess that's why I'm still a captain.

1034
01:35:11,280 --> 01:35:13,200
Besides...

1035
01:35:13,200 --> 01:35:16,600
I started feeling what you were going through.

1036
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:20,760
I heard it in your voice.

1037
01:35:27,560 --> 01:35:29,040
DISTANT RUMBLING

1038
01:35:42,920 --> 01:35:45,560
We're home free, Colonel.

1039
01:35:47,240 --> 01:35:49,160
Yeah.

1040
01:35:49,160 --> 01:35:50,640
HE SIGHS

1041
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:54,880
Cut the Colonel crap, OK, Birddog?

1042
01:35:54,880 --> 01:35:57,760
It's Iceal Hambleton.

1043
01:35:57,760 --> 01:35:59,200
Iceal?

1044
01:35:59,200 --> 01:36:00,640
Ha-ha-ha!

1045
01:36:00,640 --> 01:36:02,080
Ha-ha-ha!

1046
01:36:02,080 --> 01:36:04,000
It's Hamb.

1047
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:07,840
Yeah. Hey... Clark Bartholomew.

1048
01:36:07,840 --> 01:36:09,280
Bartholomew?

1049
01:36:09,280 --> 01:36:10,720
Clarky.

1050
01:36:10,720 --> 01:36:12,920
OK.

1051
01:36:28,920 --> 01:36:32,040
- MAN ON RADIO:
- This is USPB-Niner-6.

1052
01:36:32,040 --> 01:36:34,680
We have your boys aboard. Injuries have been treated.

1053
01:36:34,680 --> 01:36:36,960
Will rendezvous with you at base Victor-4.

1054
01:36:36,960 --> 01:36:39,480
This is Niner-6 out.

1055
01:36:39,480 --> 01:36:41,880
- WALKER:
- Welcome home, Bat 21.

1056
01:36:41,880 --> 01:36:44,760
Why don't you and the Captain meet me at the 19th hole?

1057
01:36:44,760 --> 01:36:46,680
The drinks are on me.

1058
01:36:46,680 --> 01:36:49,600
Cobra Leader, over and out.
