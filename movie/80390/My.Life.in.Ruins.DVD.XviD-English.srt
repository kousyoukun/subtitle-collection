in a very old document

at some of the murals.

475

The oldest parts of St. Marina's date back
to the 11th to 12th century B.C.

-You're open? Look at you.

-Keep it there for about an hour.

Actually, it's been about a year.

-Yes, Irv.
-Me, too.

Hey! Who's seen the Olympics on TV?

662
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:26,816
Well, we're going to Olympia,
the site of the very first Olympics.

663
00:41:26,817 --> 00:41:29,779
The ancient games began in 776 B.C.

Now, all through the era of the Pisatans...

every 5 years.

Here's something interesting.

668
00:41:40,431 --> 00:41:44,462
Until they were abolished
from 393 until 426 A.D.

669
00:41:45,236 --> 00:41:47,299
And then in 1896...

670
00:41:48,806 --> 00:41:52,166
Well, that's about the year
I started to stink.

671
00:42:07,024 --> 00:42:10,623
I know every fact and every figure
about this place.

672
00:42:10,728 --> 00:42:13,963
I mean, I love it here.
And they just want to have fun.

673
00:42:13,964 --> 00:42:16,599
And I get it,
but I don't know how to make this job fun.

674
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:19,664
Well, if you call it a job, it ain't fun.

675
00:42:19,904 --> 00:42:24,074
I mean, look at porn stars. They get to
schtup all day. They should be happy.

676
00:42:24,075 --> 00:42:26,843
You never hear about a happy porn star.

677

-No, really, were you?
-I was an ice-cream taster.

681
00:42:40,825 --> 00:42:44,060
-Get out.
-35 years.

682
00:42:44,395 --> 00:42:48,392
-I wish I had that job.
-That's what my friends used to say.

683

But then Elinor got sick.

684
00:42:55,172 --> 00:42:57,872
I had to take care of her and...

685

She always wanted to come to Greece.

So you work at an IHOP?

779
00:48:53,764 --> 00:48:56,632
Yeah, well, I mean, that makes it sound
like I'm a waiter, you know.

780
00:48:56,633 --> 00:48:59,135
I'm the number one
corporate representative for IHOP.

781
00:48:59,136 --> 00:49:01,771
I sold 100 franchises last year.

782
00:49:01,772 --> 00:49:05,408
We're expanding Ohio,
if you're looking for an investment.

783
00:49:05,409 --> 00:49:07,768
How do we say, "Cheers"?

784
00:49:08,245 --> 00:49:10,137

Syrup.

789
00:49:25,362 --> 00:49:28,392
I collect vintage syrups.

790
00:49:29,066 --> 00:49:33,669
Yeah. Some people are
into art or wines, you know.

791
00:49:33,670 --> 00:49:36,906
I'm into vintage syrups.
Not too old. When you say "vintage,"

792
00:49:36,907 --> 00:49:39,942
you think, "Oh, my God,
the guy's drinking syrup from 1912."

793
00:49:39,943 --> 00:49:42,578
No. The oldest I have is 1948.

794
00:49:42,579 --> 00:49:45,882
So it's post-war, but it's still really special.

795
00:49:45,883 --> 00:49:49,619
I mean, it's still edible. You can pote it.
It's potent, potable? Potable?

I never watch Jeopardy!

797
00:49:50,721 --> 00:49:53,523

I like about syrup is it's sweet,

798
00:49:53,524 --> 00:49:55,057
no matter how bad your day is.

799
00:49:55,058 --> 00:49:58,394
...a German waffle,
but there's also a French crepe.

800
00:49:58,395 --> 00:50:00,163
I mean, we had to have
a whole meeting in Iowa,

801
00:50:00,164 --> 00:50:02,431
because the waitresses
were calling them "craps."

802
00:50:02,432 --> 00:50:05,902
And no one wants to eat crap
so much anymore.

803
00:50:05,903 --> 00:50:07,170
Sometimes in Mississippi.

804
00:50:07,171 --> 00:50:09,338
But usually you find that
people don't want to have

805
00:50:09,339 --> 00:50:12,875
a food that's not appetizingly named,
you know.

806
00:50:12,876 --> 00:50:16,512
That's why I love any kind
of an international flair.

807
00:50:16,513 --> 00:50:20,550
Swedish crepes. It just automatically
sounds better. It's exotic.

808
00:50:20,551 --> 00:50:24,587
My favorite, though, natural.
Pecans, coconut, which is so, so good.

809
00:50:24,588 --> 00:50:28,724
It's very, very fattening, and... Not that
I have anything against fat people.

810

934
00:57:44,361 --> 00:57:47,129
You got the best seat in the house.

GEORGIA: This is a very spiritual place.

00:59:28,885 --> 00:59:32,221
You can actually feel the energy
coming from the ground.

955
00:59:32,222 --> 00:59:35,753
Do you feel it? This is the temple of Apollo

956
00:59:36,359 --> 00:59:38,991
and the sanctuary of the oracle.

was hidden from everyone

except for the high priest.
And she would crouch behind him,

960
00:59:47,704 --> 00:59:50,139
she was hidden,
and she would answer questions.

961

"The oracle is in. Any questions?"

963

Why did my husband cheat on me?

It wasn't you he cheated.

980
01:00:41,357 --> 01:00:46,219
Some men cheat themselves
out of living a life with a woman they love.
