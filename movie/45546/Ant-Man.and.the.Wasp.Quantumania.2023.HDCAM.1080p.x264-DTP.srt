2
00:02:30,167 --> 00:02:32,167
What is this place?

3
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:52,357
My life doesn't really make sense.

4
00:02:52,458 --> 00:02:55,544
I used to ask myself a lot
of questions about that.

5
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:59,716
Scott, you're a divorced ex-con.
How are you an Avenger?

6
00:02:59,755 --> 00:03:01,894
Why are you time-travelling
with Captain America?

7
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:03,575
That doesn't make sense.

8
00:03:05,013 --> 00:03:06,667
A lot has changed about my life

9
00:03:06,692 --> 00:03:09,480
but everywhere I go, people
ask me the same thing...

10
00:03:09,505 --> 00:03:11,527
Can you take a
picture with my dog?

11
00:03:11,552 --> 00:03:16,294
Scott, what about now? What's next?
Where does the ride take you?

12
00:03:16,779 --> 00:03:20,779
If I knew that, it wouldn't be a ride.

13
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:24,488
It's been a crazy few
years for everyone.

14
00:03:24,844 --> 00:03:26,411
Everything is ready for you.

15
00:03:26,482 --> 00:03:29,075
- You're too much.
- No, no, no, no...

16
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:30,732
Your money's no good here.

17
00:03:30,757 --> 00:03:33,116
- Are we still talking about that?
- Yes, of course!

18
00:03:33,768 --> 00:03:35,768
Ruben, you are the best.

19
00:03:36,057 --> 00:03:38,181
Thank you, Spider-Man!

20
00:03:39,924 --> 00:03:43,018
So let's make time for
the stuff that really matters.

21
00:03:43,043 --> 00:03:45,073
Like friends.

22
00:03:45,245 --> 00:03:47,674
Friends you didn't even know you had.

23
00:03:48,736 --> 00:03:50,802
Remember the people who got you here.

24
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:53,315
You couldn't have
done it without them.

25
00:03:53,365 --> 00:03:56,760
Hey, I'm just a guy who got
fired from Baskin Robbins.

26
00:03:57,253 --> 00:03:58,868
Sometimes you just get lucky.

27
00:03:58,893 --> 00:04:01,471
I'm lucky I met Hope Van Dyne.

28
00:04:01,496 --> 00:04:03,190
I think you know who she is.

29
00:04:03,682 --> 00:04:05,837
She's taken back her dad's company.

30
00:04:05,862 --> 00:04:09,346
Now she's using the Pym
Particle for global change.

31
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,213
A lot of people say they
want to save the world,

32
00:04:12,238 --> 00:04:14,409
but Hope? She
saves it every day.

33
00:04:14,434 --> 00:04:15,963
Thank you

34
00:04:17,018 --> 00:04:18,237
Thank you so much.

35
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:22,385
Reforestation, affordable
housing, Food production...

36
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:23,995
She's not wasting a second.

37
00:04:30,909 --> 00:04:32,424
I still can't believe it.

38
00:04:32,713 --> 00:04:34,713
None of this should've happened.

39
00:04:34,925 --> 00:04:36,127
But it did.

40
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:39,338
It's a pretty good world.

41
00:04:39,768 --> 00:04:41,575
I'm glad we saved it.

42
00:04:43,088 --> 00:04:46,362
Do I miss the action?
Sometimes.

43
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:50,463
Will I be there when the
Avengers need me? Absolutely.

44
00:04:50,488 --> 00:04:52,600
I'd never turn my back on them.

45
00:04:52,814 --> 00:04:56,635
But right now, the only
job I want is being a dad.

46
00:04:57,463 --> 00:04:59,198
I love you, Cassie.

47
00:04:59,873 --> 00:05:01,940
Thanks for being my hero.

48
00:05:03,002 --> 00:05:05,202
And I'm sorry I missed some birthdays.

49
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:11,166
And for the rest of you kids
out there, word of advice...

50
00:05:11,191 --> 00:05:12,600
Look out for the little guy.

51
00:05:13,518 --> 00:05:14,979
Make mistakes.

52
00:05:15,339 --> 00:05:16,971
Take chances.

53
00:05:17,057 --> 00:05:19,600
Because if there's one
thing life's taught me...

54
00:05:19,794 --> 00:05:23,544
There's always room to grow.

55
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:31,251
Sorry, that's me.

56
00:05:32,511 --> 00:05:34,229
Why is jail calling?

57
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,600
Lang! Lang!

58
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:41,955
- I'm here.
- All right, come on, let's go.

59
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:45,600
Come on.

60
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:52,026
- Hey. Is she ok? Have you heard anything?
- Not yet, no. Um...

61
00:05:52,635 --> 00:05:54,424
Hi, Hope.
Hey, Dad.

62
00:05:54,449 --> 00:05:57,449
- Cassie. What happened?
- Sign here.

63
00:05:57,474 --> 00:06:00,474
Oh, you know, just, jail stuff.

64
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:04,600
Give it back. I know it was you.

65
00:06:04,764 --> 00:06:05,778
Are you sure?

66
00:06:05,803 --> 00:06:07,925
I mean, it was kind of hard to see
through all that tear gas you fired

67
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:10,342
into the park full
of peaceful protesters.

68
00:06:10,367 --> 00:06:13,592
- Where is it?
- I'm sorry, this must be really embarrassing for you.

69
00:06:15,412 --> 00:06:18,826
Oh, I did find this though.

70
00:06:23,825 --> 00:06:26,090
You shrank a cop car?
What were you thinking?

71
00:06:26,115 --> 00:06:28,496
What was I supposed to do?
Look the other way?

72
00:06:28,521 --> 00:06:30,600
They were clearing out a homeless
camp in the middle of the night.

73
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,503
- No, I'm not saying...
- Where do they expect them to go?

74
00:06:32,528 --> 00:06:34,675
It's not their fault that they
lost their homes in the Blip.

75
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:35,527
I know that.

76
00:06:35,551 --> 00:06:38,559
No one can even afford rent right now
unless you're some trust fund asshole.

77
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,403
I'm not telling you what
to do. I'm just saying ---

78
00:06:40,428 --> 00:06:42,684
- Telling her what to do.
- Telling me exactly what to do.

79
00:06:42,824 --> 00:06:46,481
No, you do what you want... I'm
suggesting another way to do it.

80
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,600
Okay.

81
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:49,520
You know, I promised your mom
that you would only use this stuff

82
00:06:49,545 --> 00:06:51,545
when one of us was around.

83
00:06:51,637 --> 00:06:52,917
It's really dangerous tech.

84
00:06:52,942 --> 00:06:54,442
I know. It's dangerous.

85
00:06:54,481 --> 00:06:56,863
What if the cops took it from you?
Huh? What if you lost it?

86
00:06:56,888 --> 00:06:58,264
I didn't lose the suit.

87
00:06:58,318 --> 00:07:00,176
You have a suit... wait.
You have a suit?

88
00:07:00,201 --> 00:07:04,026
I know how to take care of myself, okay?
Trust me. I'm pretty good at it by now.

89
00:07:04,857 --> 00:07:05,857
Ouch.

90
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:10,528
- Look, I didn't mean it like that. I'm sorry.
- I know. That's okay.

91
00:07:10,553 --> 00:07:12,553
It's alright. I get it.

92
00:07:12,824 --> 00:07:15,625
I just think you should
get to have a normal life.

93
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:20,012
Dad, a guy dressed like a bee tried
to kill me in my room when I was six.

94
00:07:20,365 --> 00:07:22,365
I've never had a normal life.

95
00:07:23,729 --> 00:07:25,129
How about some music?

96
00:07:25,496 --> 00:07:29,785
And in that moment, all I could think, was
how did the Hulk turn me into a baby?

97
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:31,924
Will I be a baby forever?

98
00:07:31,949 --> 00:07:33,600
Am I the Hulk's baby?

99
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,520
Dad, are you listening
to your own book?

100
00:07:35,545 --> 00:07:36,831
- But I was ready for anything.
- Hmm?

101
00:07:36,856 --> 00:07:39,371
- No, that's... this is the radio.
- ...Steve and I...

102
00:07:39,396 --> 00:07:40,613
Dad, turn it off.

103
00:07:40,638 --> 00:07:43,012
It's so weird. Something's wrong
with this switch. It won't turn off.

104
00:07:43,037 --> 00:07:44,575
I said turn it off.

105
00:07:44,608 --> 00:07:45,964
What's that? Turn it up? Alright.

106
00:07:45,988 --> 00:07:48,457
A little after that, a raccoon
from space showed up.

107
00:07:48,497 --> 00:07:50,432
I don't think he knew my name.

108
00:07:50,457 --> 00:07:53,262
I was just happy to meet
a raccoon who could talk.

109
00:07:56,042 --> 00:07:58,551
- Excuse me.
- Thank you.

110
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:01,418
All right.

111
00:08:03,379 --> 00:08:05,167
Your Nobel Prize is in the mail.

112
00:08:05,192 --> 00:08:08,028
It better be.
I just saved $8.

113
00:08:08,278 --> 00:08:11,043
- God, I admire you.
- Thank you.

114
00:08:11,301 --> 00:08:13,676
I missed this.

115
00:08:14,154 --> 00:08:16,073
No pizza in the quantum realm?

116
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:18,600
No. No anything.

117
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,600
You know, mom, you can
talk about it. If you want.

118
00:08:22,937 --> 00:08:26,512
Sweetheart, I spent thirty
years down there.

119
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,600
I want to live right now.

120
00:08:30,416 --> 00:08:31,738
Yeah?

121
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:37,034
So Cassie, did you make any new
friends in the slammer this time?

122
00:08:37,059 --> 00:08:38,442
Grandpa...

123
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:41,370
This time? Was there a last time?

124
00:08:41,395 --> 00:08:43,600
I mean, last time barely counts.

125
00:08:44,442 --> 00:08:46,528
I didn't know that. Why
didn't you call me?

126
00:08:46,553 --> 00:08:48,106
Because I knew
you'd be like this.

127
00:08:48,184 --> 00:08:49,971
I would've just broken
you out with ants.

128
00:08:49,996 --> 00:08:51,600
All right. You know
what? Family meeting.

129
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,600
Can we have a family meeting?

130
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,775
Isn't that what we're doing?

131
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:58,113
Yeah. I mean, about this. About
everybody being so fine with this.

132
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:02,504
Look, you want to help. I get it.
I do, Cassie. I really do.

133
00:09:02,529 --> 00:09:03,875
But I don't want
you wasting your life.

134
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:06,528
At least I'm still trying to
do something with mine.

135
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,600
I literally saved the world.

136
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:13,363
Oh, did you? You never
mentioned that before.

137
00:09:13,388 --> 00:09:15,388
Everybody, Scott saved the world.

138
00:09:15,413 --> 00:09:17,926
- How was that for you, Scott?
- You should write a book about it.

139
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:21,762
Haha. Hilarious. Yeah you're
welcome for all not being dust.

140
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,403
And what do you do now?

141
00:09:24,839 --> 00:09:26,449
Sign books?

142
00:09:27,576 --> 00:09:29,576
Aren't you the guy who
broke into Vista Corp?

143
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:33,267
Aren't you the guy who flew all the way to Germany
just to fight Captain America at the airport?

144
00:09:33,292 --> 00:09:36,092
Fight with Captain
America at the airport.

145
00:09:36,456 --> 00:09:39,793
I wouldn't fight Captain America.
I'm not insane.

146
00:09:40,206 --> 00:09:42,506
People still need help, Dad.

147
00:09:42,822 --> 00:09:45,522
At least we're trying to do
something that matters.

148
00:09:49,013 --> 00:09:50,342
Who's "we"?

149
00:09:51,822 --> 00:09:53,482
What are you three up to?

150
00:09:54,437 --> 00:09:55,974
Science.

151
00:09:57,226 --> 00:09:58,795
With ants.

152
00:09:59,521 --> 00:10:01,060
Ant science.

153
00:10:02,156 --> 00:10:03,959
I don't believe you.

154
00:10:05,374 --> 00:10:06,928
Let's just show him.

155
00:10:10,584 --> 00:10:12,279
Woah, what are they building?

156
00:10:12,304 --> 00:10:13,304
Are you doing this?

157
00:10:13,329 --> 00:10:16,329
Actually no. They built their own tech.

158
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,430
Pretty smart ants.

159
00:10:18,455 --> 00:10:23,455
Okay, so when you were all like, gone
those 5 years, I had a lot of time.

160
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,098
And I started reading
Grandpa Hank's old journals.

161
00:10:26,123 --> 00:10:28,560
And I got really into
the quantum realm, and...

162
00:10:28,916 --> 00:10:30,366
The quantum realm?

163
00:10:30,506 --> 00:10:33,053
I know we all have a history there,
and I didn't want to freak anyone out,

164
00:10:33,078 --> 00:10:34,500
but we were talking about it.

165
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:38,701
She had some questions, okay? I
can't help if people are inspired by me.

166
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:44,391
So you've been studying
the quantum realm?

167
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:47,500
Why didn't you ask me about it?

168
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:49,607
I tried, Mom.

169
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:52,840
A lot. You never wanted
to talk about it.

170
00:10:52,865 --> 00:10:56,330
Cassie's just been curious, and
we gave her some pointers.

171
00:10:56,355 --> 00:11:00,305
This isn't exactly ant
science, is it, Henry?

172
00:11:00,713 --> 00:11:02,794
You know how dangerous
the quantum realm is.

173
00:11:03,283 --> 00:11:05,826
We all do, mom. Nobody's
going to the quantum realm.

174
00:11:05,851 --> 00:11:07,795
That's why we made this.

175
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:11,500
It's like a satellite for
deep space or the ocean.

176
00:11:12,279 --> 00:11:13,357
But...

177
00:11:14,311 --> 00:11:15,724
... Quantum.

178
00:11:17,946 --> 00:11:19,421
We just need a map.

179
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:22,709
And then we can study and
explore the entire quantum realm.

180
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:25,500
We'd never even have to go.

181
00:11:25,721 --> 00:11:30,421
Your daughter built a subatomic
Hubble telescope in a basement.

182
00:11:33,562 --> 00:11:36,717
You know, if I had something like
this when you were gone, then...

183
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:40,637
I could've found you.

184
00:11:43,837 --> 00:11:45,215
It's amazing.

185
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:47,390
I'm blown away.

186
00:11:49,427 --> 00:11:50,675
How does it work?

187
00:11:51,059 --> 00:11:54,020
It's kinda like that two-way
radio we used to have?

188
00:11:54,333 --> 00:11:58,069
You send a signal down from here and
then it collects the data and it sends it back.

189
00:11:58,094 --> 00:11:59,317
Wait, wait a minute.

190
00:11:59,567 --> 00:12:03,500
You're sending a signal?
Down to the quantum realm?

191
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:05,941
Yeah.

192
00:12:05,966 --> 00:12:08,325
Shut it down, now.

193
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:09,644
- Janet...
- Why would we shut it...

194
00:12:09,669 --> 00:12:10,500
What's wrong?

195
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:11,500
You have to turn it off!

196
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,500
You got to tell us what's wrong.

197
00:12:16,661 --> 00:12:17,880
Janet.

198
00:12:22,153 --> 00:12:24,453
There is something I
should have told you.

199
00:12:58,378 --> 00:12:59,729
Dad!

200
00:13:01,789 --> 00:13:02,823
No!

201
00:13:03,122 --> 00:13:04,495
Mom!

202
00:13:11,175 --> 00:13:12,338
Dad!

203
00:13:43,825 --> 00:13:44,898
Dad!

204
00:14:16,861 --> 00:14:17,869
Cassie?

205
00:14:23,247 --> 00:14:24,533
Dad!

206
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:26,439
Dad, come on.

207
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:29,500
Are you okay?

208
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:30,759
Yeah, I'm okay.

209
00:14:46,148 --> 00:14:48,148
Where are we?

210
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:07,670
Mom!

211
00:15:08,946 --> 00:15:09,951
Dad!

212
00:15:10,248 --> 00:15:12,125
Hope, over here.

213
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:15,631
Are you okay?

214
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:18,500
We should be dead.

215
00:15:18,843 --> 00:15:20,005
Where are we?

216
00:15:20,148 --> 00:15:21,373
I don't know.

217
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:25,390
Are we where I think we are?

218
00:15:25,713 --> 00:15:27,701
I would say yes, but...

219
00:15:28,678 --> 00:15:31,069
It wasn't like this. Janet!

220
00:15:31,881 --> 00:15:32,889
Mom!

221
00:15:33,664 --> 00:15:34,928
Janet!

222
00:15:35,975 --> 00:15:37,108
Mom!

223
00:15:49,304 --> 00:15:51,304
Do not move.

224
00:16:10,101 --> 00:16:11,812
We need to find Scott and Cassie.

225
00:16:12,687 --> 00:16:13,687
Right now.

226
00:16:17,328 --> 00:16:18,500
Hope?

227
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:19,500
Hope...

228
00:16:19,851 --> 00:16:22,312
Hank, can you hear me?

229
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:24,500
Can anyone hear me?

230
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:25,500
Oh, my God.

231
00:16:26,812 --> 00:16:28,180
- It's okay.
- What are we gonna do?

232
00:16:28,205 --> 00:16:29,367
It's okay. It's okay.

233
00:16:29,392 --> 00:16:30,664
We're okay. We're okay.

234
00:16:30,689 --> 00:16:32,367
- It's gonna be okay.
- You're saying okay too much.

235
00:16:32,392 --> 00:16:33,513
Okay, alright. Okay.

236
00:16:33,538 --> 00:16:34,625
Well, it's 'cause we are.

237
00:16:34,650 --> 00:16:35,945
We are okay.

238
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:37,203
We are fine, okay?

239
00:16:37,228 --> 00:16:39,640
We're gonna find them,
and we're gonna go home

240
00:16:40,476 --> 00:16:41,725
I mean take a look around.

241
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:43,203
It's beautiful.

242
00:16:43,228 --> 00:16:45,228
All right? We're outside.

243
00:16:45,253 --> 00:16:46,406
It's like we're camping.

244
00:16:46,431 --> 00:16:47,431
We love camping.

245
00:16:47,456 --> 00:16:49,356
We've never been camping.

246
00:16:50,145 --> 00:16:51,968
But we've always talked about it.

247
00:16:56,234 --> 00:16:58,234
Is that sun moving?

248
00:17:08,801 --> 00:17:10,247
Get back!

249
00:17:15,672 --> 00:17:17,672
I don't think this is the sun.

250
00:17:19,126 --> 00:17:20,298
It's fine.

251
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:22,500
- Dad!
- It's okay!

252
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,500
Still okay.

253
00:17:32,261 --> 00:17:33,849
Dad!
Oh, my God!

254
00:17:33,874 --> 00:17:35,874
That was weird.

255
00:17:40,273 --> 00:17:41,368
Run.

256
00:18:09,376 --> 00:18:13,251
There's quantum people
in the quantum realm?

257
00:18:13,437 --> 00:18:14,437
Yeah...

258
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:16,688
I didn't know that either.

259
00:18:20,952 --> 00:18:22,254
What was that back there, mom?

260
00:18:22,279 --> 00:18:24,066
What was that ship looking for?

261
00:18:24,091 --> 00:18:25,703
Keep your voice down.

262
00:18:25,871 --> 00:18:28,020
You said there was
nothing down here.

263
00:18:28,045 --> 00:18:30,475
- Why didn't you tell us about all of this?
- Hope I will explain everything,

264
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,098
but right now, I just
need you to trust me.

265
00:18:32,123 --> 00:18:33,123
Then make me trust you.

266
00:18:33,148 --> 00:18:34,855
Let's just calm down, all right?

267
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:35,948
We can talk about...

268
00:18:35,973 --> 00:18:38,074
We don't have time to talk, Henry.

269
00:18:38,099 --> 00:18:39,201
No, you need to tell us what...

270
00:18:39,226 --> 00:18:40,355
And why didn't you listen?

271
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:42,380
I told you to stay away from here.

272
00:18:42,869 --> 00:18:45,469
Janet, I'm so sorry.

273
00:18:45,801 --> 00:18:47,487
I should have told you
what we were doing.

274
00:18:47,512 --> 00:18:48,651
I had no idea...

275
00:18:48,676 --> 00:18:50,059
I know. It's...

276
00:18:50,793 --> 00:18:52,168
We'll talk later.

277
00:18:52,193 --> 00:18:54,193
Right now, we stick together,

278
00:18:54,729 --> 00:18:56,429
we find Scott and Cassie...

279
00:18:57,039 --> 00:18:58,691
And we go home, okay?

280
00:18:58,952 --> 00:19:00,952
- Okay?
- Okay.

281
00:19:01,234 --> 00:19:02,379
Okay, stay close.

282
00:19:09,666 --> 00:19:11,472
This is incredible.

283
00:19:11,918 --> 00:19:14,500
I studied the quantum realm for years.

284
00:19:16,403 --> 00:19:18,184
Why didn't I see any of this?

285
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,320
You weren't able to look deep enough.

286
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:23,058
Not through the Void
and Subatomica.

287
00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:25,864
There are worlds here.

288
00:19:26,098 --> 00:19:27,809
Worlds with worlds.

289
00:19:28,854 --> 00:19:32,559
It's a place outside
time and... space.

290
00:19:34,355 --> 00:19:35,934
It's a secret universe...

291
00:19:36,882 --> 00:19:38,262
beneath ours.

292
00:19:59,999 --> 00:20:01,566
Get your hands off me!

293
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:09,500
Cassie?

294
00:20:12,327 --> 00:20:13,711
Where is my daughter?

295
00:20:15,328 --> 00:20:17,000
Where is she?

296
00:20:17,499 --> 00:20:18,906
Cassie?

297
00:20:22,499 --> 00:20:23,758
Where is my daughter?

298
00:20:27,256 --> 00:20:28,367
Cassie!

299
00:20:30,765 --> 00:20:31,765
Dad!

300
00:20:32,609 --> 00:20:34,008
Cassie.

301
00:20:34,078 --> 00:20:35,500
Drink the ooze.

302
00:20:36,914 --> 00:20:38,031
What?

303
00:21:00,196 --> 00:21:01,696
I'll handle this.

304
00:21:15,728 --> 00:21:16,868
Mom?

305
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:12,971
Was that a good stab?

306
00:22:13,195 --> 00:22:14,674
I got us a ride.

307
00:22:33,964 --> 00:22:35,414
He's friendly.

308
00:22:35,439 --> 00:22:36,895
Quite a ride.

309
00:22:37,077 --> 00:22:40,184
Says the man who invented
flying on the back of an ant.

310
00:22:40,209 --> 00:22:41,209
I like ants.

311
00:22:41,234 --> 00:22:43,500
And I love that you love them.
Here.

312
00:22:44,332 --> 00:22:46,902
These will help us blend in.

313
00:22:47,194 --> 00:22:49,988
Where exactly are
we going in this?

314
00:22:50,062 --> 00:22:52,062
We're not too far from
an old friend of mine.

315
00:22:52,087 --> 00:22:54,809
If anyone's heard where
Scott and Cassie are,

316
00:22:54,984 --> 00:22:56,152
It'll be him.

317
00:22:57,604 --> 00:22:59,054
After you.

318
00:22:59,837 --> 00:23:01,426
Saddle up, Ant-Man.

319
00:23:06,613 --> 00:23:08,645
Let me go! Let me go!

320
00:23:19,817 --> 00:23:21,701
I don't know what you're saying!

321
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:56,293
Drink the ooze!

322
00:23:56,356 --> 00:23:58,035
Drink the ooze!

323
00:23:58,060 --> 00:23:59,521
Drink the ooze!

324
00:24:01,139 --> 00:24:02,139
Hello.

325
00:24:02,332 --> 00:24:03,434
- Hello!
- Hi. Hi.

326
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:04,926
Did you drink the ooze?

327
00:24:06,504 --> 00:24:07,825
Why can I understand you?

328
00:24:07,850 --> 00:24:09,238
Oh, great, that's the ooze.

329
00:24:09,263 --> 00:24:10,500
Hey everybody, it worked.

330
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:11,731
Ooze worked.

331
00:24:16,293 --> 00:24:18,660
Hi, I am Veb. You just drank me.

332
00:24:18,685 --> 00:24:19,691
I did what?

333
00:24:19,716 --> 00:24:21,168
Oh, do you need
some more ooze?

334
00:24:21,193 --> 00:24:22,793
Here, I could pour some
ooze in your hole...

335
00:24:22,818 --> 00:24:24,475
No, I'm okay. I'm okay.

336
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:25,500
Oh, wow.

337
00:24:25,778 --> 00:24:27,082
What a big hole.

338
00:24:27,107 --> 00:24:29,107
How many holes do you have?

339
00:24:29,132 --> 00:24:30,500
I'm sorry, is that a
personal question?

340
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:32,082
I don't have any holes.

341
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:34,500
His name is Scott Lang...

342
00:24:35,586 --> 00:24:36,934
And he has seven holes.

343
00:24:41,845 --> 00:24:43,160
Yeah, that's right.

344
00:24:43,207 --> 00:24:44,785
How did you know that?

345
00:24:44,836 --> 00:24:46,973
He's Quaz. He's a telepath.

346
00:24:49,238 --> 00:24:50,500
You can read minds?

347
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:53,785
Yeah, and I really wish I couldn't.

348
00:24:53,925 --> 00:24:56,801
Everyone is disgusting.

349
00:24:58,551 --> 00:25:00,176
Could you please stop thinking that?

350
00:25:00,201 --> 00:25:01,207
Sorry.

351
00:25:01,559 --> 00:25:02,629
Please, stop.

352
00:25:02,654 --> 00:25:04,801
- Thinking?
- Thinking that.

353
00:25:04,895 --> 00:25:06,152
I'm trying.

354
00:25:06,495 --> 00:25:09,074
No, not very hard.
And I think you look weird, too.

355
00:25:09,121 --> 00:25:10,352
I don't think you look weird.
I think you look really cool.

356
00:25:10,377 --> 00:25:12,377
I wish my head glowed.

357
00:25:12,968 --> 00:25:14,152
No, no. You don't.

358
00:25:14,177 --> 00:25:15,475
I know I don't. I just,
I'm nervous, okay?

359
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:16,600
That just came out.

360
00:25:16,625 --> 00:25:17,749
What are you doing here?

361
00:25:17,774 --> 00:25:18,746
Are you a spy?

362
00:25:18,771 --> 00:25:19,893
What? No.
No, no, no.

363
00:25:19,918 --> 00:25:20,801
We should torture him.

364
00:25:20,826 --> 00:25:21,826
Guys, no. It's okay.

365
00:25:21,968 --> 00:25:24,152
We're not... we're not spies.

366
00:25:24,177 --> 00:25:25,270
He's my dad.

367
00:25:27,199 --> 00:25:28,746
- Thank you.
- Welcome.

368
00:25:28,812 --> 00:25:32,465
Then, who is San Francisco?

369
00:25:32,892 --> 00:25:34,395
- It's where we're from.
- It's a place.

370
00:25:34,422 --> 00:25:35,422
And what's Earth?

371
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:36,500
It's also where we're from.

372
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:37,690
We should torture them.

373
00:25:37,715 --> 00:25:39,231
Why are you always
trying to torture people?

374
00:25:39,256 --> 00:25:40,317
We have other options.

375
00:25:40,342 --> 00:25:43,004
Do things come out of your holes?
Like milk, juice...

376
00:25:43,029 --> 00:25:45,207
Veb, stop asking
him about his hole,

377
00:25:45,232 --> 00:25:46,776
some of us have holes.

378
00:25:46,801 --> 00:25:48,223
What are you doing here?

379
00:25:48,248 --> 00:25:50,027
Where are you from?

380
00:25:50,461 --> 00:25:51,231
Okay...

381
00:25:51,256 --> 00:25:53,277
- Up there, up there. The Earth.
- Somewhere above this...

382
00:25:53,302 --> 00:25:54,729
- It's a different universe.
- Big Earth.

383
00:25:54,754 --> 00:25:57,620
- Well, this is Earth. But it's very smaller...
- It's the same universe, but it's bigger...

384
00:25:57,645 --> 00:25:59,121
- I get big, I shrink...
- Yeah. Yeah.

385
00:25:59,146 --> 00:26:01,332
You know, but I wrote a
book about it, actually.

386
00:26:01,379 --> 00:26:03,363
This is the quantum realm, you have to
shrink to enter the quantum realm.

387
00:26:03,388 --> 00:26:06,629
So we shrunk. And right now we're
really small. So we're smaller now.

388
00:26:11,348 --> 00:26:13,348
Okay.
They're telling the truth.

389
00:26:13,450 --> 00:26:15,270
It doesn't matter.

390
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:19,277
You come from above,

391
00:26:20,661 --> 00:26:22,059
like him.

392
00:26:23,106 --> 00:26:25,723
So he is hunting you.

393
00:26:26,476 --> 00:26:29,160
He will burn the
world to find you.

394
00:26:29,766 --> 00:26:30,926
Who?

395
00:26:32,543 --> 00:26:33,871
The Conqueror.

396
00:27:36,497 --> 00:27:40,113
There are beings down
here. Intelligent beings.

397
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:43,434
I always theorized it was
possible. But to be here...

398
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:46,441
A subatomic universe.

399
00:27:46,705 --> 00:27:49,066
This changes everything
we know about life.

400
00:27:49,199 --> 00:27:51,902
Evolution, our place in the galaxy...

401
00:27:51,927 --> 00:27:53,551
Holy shit!

402
00:27:54,028 --> 00:27:55,731
That guy looks like broccoli.

403
00:28:05,127 --> 00:28:06,621
Keep your head down.

404
00:28:58,470 --> 00:28:59,887
Follow me.

405
00:29:13,141 --> 00:29:14,261
Drink those.

406
00:29:14,537 --> 00:29:15,840
I will be right back.

407
00:29:30,421 --> 00:29:32,240
I'm here for Krylar.

408
00:29:34,650 --> 00:29:37,500
Oh, it's... It's you.

409
00:29:37,734 --> 00:29:39,470
Let's keep that between us.

410
00:29:40,307 --> 00:29:41,588
And Krylar.

411
00:29:41,850 --> 00:29:43,197
Hello.

412
00:29:43,757 --> 00:29:45,930
I don't know your
ways or customs,

413
00:29:45,955 --> 00:29:49,500
but I assume you have a beverage
that can get me drunk?

414
00:29:49,585 --> 00:29:51,353
Absolutely, sir.

415
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:56,033
So what's your story then?

416
00:29:57,719 --> 00:29:58,821
God.

417
00:30:00,009 --> 00:30:01,330
Move.

418
00:30:01,802 --> 00:30:03,744
It's time. Follow me.

419
00:30:10,550 --> 00:30:12,447
Right this way.

420
00:30:17,462 --> 00:30:19,954
How exactly do you know this guy?

421
00:30:20,228 --> 00:30:23,421
An old freedom
fighter. Friend of mine.

422
00:30:23,634 --> 00:30:25,626
Sorry, you were a
freedom fighter?

423
00:30:25,687 --> 00:30:29,103
Or terrorist, depends
on who you ask.

424
00:30:29,128 --> 00:30:30,150
But...

425
00:30:30,450 --> 00:30:32,345
Trust me, he can help.

426
00:31:14,382 --> 00:31:16,828
Janet Van Dyne?

427
00:31:18,765 --> 00:31:20,655
I thought you were dead.

428
00:31:20,992 --> 00:31:22,914
It's been a long time, Krylar.

429
00:31:23,055 --> 00:31:24,453
Officially...

430
00:31:24,710 --> 00:31:26,468
Lord Krylar now.

431
00:31:26,493 --> 00:31:28,828
I fought like hell to get us that.

432
00:31:29,351 --> 00:31:31,116
But it sounds so elitist.

433
00:31:32,148 --> 00:31:34,929
You have got to be Hank.

434
00:31:35,476 --> 00:31:38,875
I've heard so much about
you and your ants.

435
00:31:38,968 --> 00:31:42,664
What are ants anyway?
Do we have them down here?

436
00:31:42,786 --> 00:31:44,609
I don't think so. No.

437
00:31:45,050 --> 00:31:46,500
Oh, that's too bad.

438
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,500
Hope?

439
00:31:49,550 --> 00:31:51,500
You have to be Hope.

440
00:31:51,996 --> 00:31:54,328
She talked about you every day.

441
00:31:54,353 --> 00:31:58,437
That's strange. She never
said anything about you.

442
00:32:00,535 --> 00:32:02,945
Well, I don't think I would've
told my kid either.

443
00:32:03,656 --> 00:32:05,109
Wild stuff.

444
00:32:05,421 --> 00:32:07,195
How wild?

445
00:32:08,156 --> 00:32:10,062
Very wild, Henry.

446
00:32:11,757 --> 00:32:12,921
Krylar...

447
00:32:13,489 --> 00:32:15,085
We need your help.

448
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:19,500
Janet, after all we've
been through? Together?

449
00:32:19,629 --> 00:32:22,078
Just ask me. Tell me
how can I help?

450
00:32:22,141 --> 00:32:23,218
But...

451
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:26,664
Is anyone starving? I'm starving.

452
00:32:26,949 --> 00:32:28,170
Boys...

453
00:32:28,810 --> 00:32:29,944
Now.

454
00:32:37,935 --> 00:32:39,546
They don't know anything...

455
00:32:39,571 --> 00:32:42,523
about anything.

456
00:32:42,795 --> 00:32:44,312
Then get them out of here.

457
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:46,500
Excuse me.

458
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:47,631
Look, he's right.

459
00:32:47,656 --> 00:32:48,873
I don't know what's going on.

460
00:32:48,898 --> 00:32:50,500
We're just trying to
find our family.

461
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:51,679
Do you have a map?

462
00:32:51,728 --> 00:32:53,671
All we want to
do is go... woah.

463
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:57,351
Wait, wait, wait!
Don't shoot.

464
00:32:57,398 --> 00:32:58,773
They're with us.

465
00:33:00,351 --> 00:33:01,929
Is that building alive?

466
00:33:02,344 --> 00:33:03,671
Yours are dead?

467
00:33:06,953 --> 00:33:08,406
Look, excuse me.

468
00:33:08,431 --> 00:33:10,024
We just want to go home

469
00:33:13,723 --> 00:33:16,000
At least you still have a home.

470
00:33:23,492 --> 00:33:25,164
What happened here?

471
00:33:25,950 --> 00:33:28,687
The Conqueror burned our homes.

472
00:33:29,242 --> 00:33:30,781
Our stories.

473
00:33:31,953 --> 00:33:34,937
He built his citadel on the
bones of our people.

474
00:33:36,116 --> 00:33:38,366
Some of us escaped.

475
00:33:38,414 --> 00:33:40,414
Found others on the run.

476
00:33:40,812 --> 00:33:42,616
We gathered who
we could to fight.

477
00:33:43,084 --> 00:33:44,687
It was never enough.

478
00:33:45,890 --> 00:33:47,125
I'm sorry.

479
00:33:48,048 --> 00:33:49,507
We can help.

480
00:33:54,295 --> 00:33:55,460
Uh, Cassie...

481
00:33:55,485 --> 00:33:57,328
Dad, you're an Avenger.

482
00:33:57,353 --> 00:33:58,475
- They need help.
- No...

483
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:00,500
What I need to do
is get you home.

484
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:01,789
Why don't you
want to help?

485
00:34:02,027 --> 00:34:03,336
We don't know anything
about this place.

486
00:34:03,361 --> 00:34:05,109
I mean, not even how
time works down here.

487
00:34:05,142 --> 00:34:07,695
Have we been gone for 10 seconds,
or have we been out for 10 years?

488
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:09,709
Think about your mom
right now. Can you imagine?

489
00:34:09,734 --> 00:34:11,500
Don't use mom as an excuse.

490
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:13,500
- You just don't care.
- No, I do care.

491
00:34:13,629 --> 00:34:15,429
I know you want
to help. I do.

492
00:34:15,704 --> 00:34:17,257
But this is not our fight.

493
00:34:17,282 --> 00:34:19,031
Just because it's
not happening to you,

494
00:34:19,056 --> 00:34:21,056
doesn't mean
it's not happening.

495
00:34:22,295 --> 00:34:23,467
Hey.

496
00:34:25,795 --> 00:34:27,343
Would you look at me?

497
00:34:29,171 --> 00:34:30,726
She's disappointed in you.

498
00:34:30,921 --> 00:34:32,500
I got that. Yeah. Thank you.

499
00:34:32,675 --> 00:34:33,675
You're welcome.

500
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:36,843
We'll talk about it later. Right
now, let's just find the others.

501
00:34:36,968 --> 00:34:39,257
No one knows this
place better than Janet.

502
00:34:41,406 --> 00:34:42,406
What did you say?

503
00:34:42,687 --> 00:34:43,703
What?

504
00:34:44,007 --> 00:34:45,312
That name.

505
00:34:46,265 --> 00:34:48,500
- Janet... Van Dyne?
- Where is she?

506
00:34:48,921 --> 00:34:50,343
That's what we're
trying to find out.

507
00:34:50,376 --> 00:34:51,475
Do you know her?

508
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:52,898
I know her.

509
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:55,796
She shouldn't be here.

510
00:34:57,250 --> 00:34:59,500
Hey, bring a round
of the chasers, please.

511
00:34:59,538 --> 00:35:00,538
Yes, thank you.

512
00:35:00,858 --> 00:35:04,186
If you haven't had this, don't try it.

513
00:35:04,421 --> 00:35:07,132
Unless you want
to change your life.

514
00:35:17,809 --> 00:35:21,500
Krylar, we're looking
for friends of ours.

515
00:35:22,250 --> 00:35:23,500
Two of them.

516
00:35:23,728 --> 00:35:25,051
Human, like us.

517
00:35:25,076 --> 00:35:26,012
Human.

518
00:35:26,037 --> 00:35:30,037
That's the word. Totally forgot
what you call yourselves up there.

519
00:35:30,344 --> 00:35:31,344
Human.

520
00:35:31,911 --> 00:35:33,965
Are you not human?

521
00:35:34,179 --> 00:35:36,179
Not technically, but yes.

522
00:35:36,698 --> 00:35:38,458
In the ways that matter.

523
00:35:42,585 --> 00:35:43,585
No!

524
00:35:47,099 --> 00:35:48,678
Let us talk.

525
00:35:51,374 --> 00:35:55,662
So, what is it that
brings you to us, Janet?

526
00:35:57,179 --> 00:35:59,654
If I remember correctly, you left.

527
00:35:59,974 --> 00:36:01,435
You left...

528
00:36:01,935 --> 00:36:05,029
all of us, with him.

529
00:36:06,471 --> 00:36:08,521
Janet, what is he talking about?

530
00:36:10,404 --> 00:36:13,247
You didn't tell them about him.

531
00:36:16,187 --> 00:36:20,451
Did you say anything
about what you did here?

532
00:36:22,187 --> 00:36:24,756
How many people died
because of you?

533
00:36:29,401 --> 00:36:32,467
Does your family even
know who you are?

534
00:36:35,506 --> 00:36:39,857
Your mommy, is
full of secrets.

535
00:36:40,343 --> 00:36:42,826
- You're lying.
- I lie

536
00:36:43,454 --> 00:36:44,959
a lot.

537
00:36:47,521 --> 00:36:49,349
Not about this.

538
00:36:51,234 --> 00:36:52,904
Let them go.

539
00:36:54,112 --> 00:36:55,937
He just wants me.

540
00:36:56,352 --> 00:37:00,888
But you want them,
so, they're coming too.

541
00:37:01,812 --> 00:37:05,312
Along with those
other friends of yours.

542
00:37:06,406 --> 00:37:11,154
I heard about them,
but he did too. And...

543
00:37:12,329 --> 00:37:13,935
He sent a hunter.

544
00:37:14,415 --> 00:37:16,334
What kind of hunter?

545
00:37:17,038 --> 00:37:19,568
Not a man, not a machine.

546
00:37:19,632 --> 00:37:25,560
A mechanized organism
designed only for killing...

547
00:37:27,514 --> 00:37:29,006
Where are they?

548
00:37:29,187 --> 00:37:30,678
No clue.

549
00:37:31,835 --> 00:37:33,303
Dead.

550
00:37:34,563 --> 00:37:36,693
Probably. Dead.

551
00:37:49,022 --> 00:37:50,879
Oh, this is so sad,

552
00:37:50,904 --> 00:37:54,865
when all of this could
have been avoided, Janet.

553
00:37:55,909 --> 00:37:57,872
Just give him
what he wants.

554
00:38:00,806 --> 00:38:02,560
What's happened to you?

555
00:38:04,963 --> 00:38:08,756
We fought against him.

556
00:38:10,250 --> 00:38:12,013
He can be very persuasive.

557
00:38:14,339 --> 00:38:15,771
Let's pay him a visit.

558
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:21,162
I think we're done here.

559
00:38:38,874 --> 00:38:40,671
Can that ship get
us out of here?

560
00:38:42,977 --> 00:38:43,977
Cover me?

561
00:38:44,116 --> 00:38:45,235
Always.

562
00:39:16,694 --> 00:39:18,444
Henry, take the helm.

563
00:39:18,863 --> 00:39:20,936
I'm going to hotwire this thing.

564
00:39:24,325 --> 00:39:26,109
Where are the controls?

565
00:39:26,452 --> 00:39:28,030
Those are the controls.

566
00:39:31,405 --> 00:39:32,700
What the hell?

567
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:34,702
You'll do great. It's
like flying a bike.

568
00:39:37,093 --> 00:39:39,007
Is the bike alive?

569
00:39:52,583 --> 00:39:54,583
Hands all the way in.

570
00:39:55,011 --> 00:39:56,808
Like stuffing a turkey.

571
00:40:04,204 --> 00:40:06,509
- Really? Him?
- He used to be charming.

572
00:40:06,534 --> 00:40:07,423
With that guy?

573
00:40:07,448 --> 00:40:09,556
I was down here
for 30 years, Henry.

574
00:40:09,581 --> 00:40:11,197
- I had needs.
- Oh, my God.

575
00:40:11,222 --> 00:40:14,454
- Look, I get it. I've got needs, too.
- Oh, my God!

576
00:40:14,479 --> 00:40:16,837
I had dinner with
someone a few times.

577
00:40:17,181 --> 00:40:18,900
Her name was Linda.

578
00:40:19,564 --> 00:40:20,890
They didn't work out.

579
00:40:20,915 --> 00:40:22,509
What went wrong?

580
00:40:22,622 --> 00:40:24,056
She wasn't you, baby.

581
00:40:27,477 --> 00:40:29,700
Get everyone on the ships.
We're leaving.

582
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:30,633
All right.

583
00:40:30,664 --> 00:40:31,594
And Xolum.

584
00:40:31,619 --> 00:40:32,619
Right here.

585
00:40:32,644 --> 00:40:34,644
Take them as far away
from here as you can.

586
00:40:34,825 --> 00:40:35,825
- What?
- Why?

587
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:39,477
If you're looking for Janet,
He's looking for you.

588
00:40:47,487 --> 00:40:49,700
You led them straight to us!

589
00:40:50,010 --> 00:40:51,447
Come on. Come on!

590
00:40:51,908 --> 00:40:53,700
Take as many as you can.

591
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:55,088
We'll hold them off.

592
00:41:18,242 --> 00:41:19,328
Go!

593
00:41:20,503 --> 00:41:22,367
- Come on!
- Hurry!

594
00:41:22,731 --> 00:41:24,258
We have got to go.

595
00:41:24,283 --> 00:41:25,539
Get on, get on, now.

596
00:41:25,606 --> 00:41:27,399
Let's go, now! Now!

597
00:42:03,348 --> 00:42:05,229
Cassie, let's go.

598
00:42:11,763 --> 00:42:13,700
Get to the sanctuary.

599
00:42:13,865 --> 00:42:15,435
Wait for my message.

600
00:42:15,460 --> 00:42:16,998
Veb, we're leaving.

601
00:42:17,521 --> 00:42:20,013
- Move!
- But my friends!

602
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:44,700
Give up the travelers. The
Conqueror will show you mercy.

603
00:42:44,725 --> 00:42:46,406
I know his mercy.

604
00:42:59,748 --> 00:43:01,296
Stay here...

605
00:43:02,592 --> 00:43:04,012
Cassie?

606
00:43:04,967 --> 00:43:06,053
Oh, no.

607
00:43:28,692 --> 00:43:30,567
Okay, I have a suit.

608
00:43:30,700 --> 00:43:32,848
Yeah, I noticed.

609
00:43:33,028 --> 00:43:34,567
- You okay?
- Yes.

610
00:43:36,051 --> 00:43:37,503
Look, momentum, right?

611
00:43:37,528 --> 00:43:39,700
Jump, tap, right?
One move, jump, tap.

612
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:40,809
I know how
to do it, dad.

613
00:43:40,834 --> 00:43:42,184
- Oh, do you? Really?
- Yes!

614
00:43:42,209 --> 00:43:44,800
- 'Cause it didn't look like it from my end.
- I messed up on the timing.

615
00:43:44,825 --> 00:43:46,300
Jump...

616
00:43:51,308 --> 00:43:52,363
Like that.

617
00:43:52,388 --> 00:43:54,050
You see what I did?
You see what I did?

618
00:43:54,215 --> 00:43:56,417
No, you were like this small!

619
00:43:56,442 --> 00:43:57,964
I jumped and tapped.

620
00:44:08,019 --> 00:44:10,183
Jentorra, we have to go.

621
00:44:30,864 --> 00:44:32,317
Get to the ship!

622
00:45:19,817 --> 00:45:22,386
Welcome back to the
quantum realm, Scott.

623
00:45:23,236 --> 00:45:25,667
I've been waiting
a long time for this.

624
00:45:26,582 --> 00:45:27,777
What?

625
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:30,700
Is someone in there?

626
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:32,238
Oh, yes.

627
00:45:32,543 --> 00:45:35,347
A destiny you cannot escape.

628
00:45:35,676 --> 00:45:38,503
Our fates have always
been forged together.

629
00:45:40,816 --> 00:45:42,816
Ever since that day we met.

630
00:45:45,027 --> 00:45:46,700
Scott Lang.

631
00:45:46,700 --> 00:45:47,700
Get away from us!

632
00:45:47,700 --> 00:45:50,137
And then you broke me.

633
00:45:52,700 --> 00:45:55,700
- Banished me down here.
- Wait...

634
00:45:56,950 --> 00:45:58,238
Darren?

635
00:45:59,574 --> 00:46:01,354
Surprised to see me?

636
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,167
Yeah.

637
00:46:04,417 --> 00:46:05,700
It's that bee guy.

638
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:06,700
It's the bee guy.

639
00:46:06,864 --> 00:46:07,864
Cassie?

640
00:46:08,050 --> 00:46:09,700
I almost didn't recognize you.

641
00:46:09,966 --> 00:46:11,966
How are you not dead?

642
00:46:12,179 --> 00:46:14,629
I became the ultimate weapon.

643
00:46:15,350 --> 00:46:17,700
That's what this is?

644
00:46:18,386 --> 00:46:19,700
Look, Darren...

645
00:46:23,775 --> 00:46:25,517
Darren is dead!

646
00:46:25,876 --> 00:46:27,548
There is only...

647
00:46:27,573 --> 00:46:29,087
M.O.D.O.K!

648
00:46:29,743 --> 00:46:32,015
And there's no place
you can run, Scott.

649
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:33,700
Not from me,

650
00:46:33,700 --> 00:46:35,700
and not from him.

651
00:46:36,492 --> 00:46:38,470
He is the future.

652
00:46:39,212 --> 00:46:40,735
He's the best.

653
00:46:41,087 --> 00:46:44,887
And now all he needs is you.

654
00:46:50,824 --> 00:46:53,962
Mom, what's after Scott and Cassie?

655
00:46:55,937 --> 00:46:57,637
We have to find them.

656
00:46:58,550 --> 00:47:00,384
There's something I have to do first.

657
00:47:00,409 --> 00:47:01,700
He could be dead.

658
00:47:02,027 --> 00:47:03,502
Hope, please.

659
00:47:03,551 --> 00:47:05,017
And you're still
hiding things from us.

660
00:47:05,042 --> 00:47:07,587
I am trying to protect you.

661
00:47:08,230 --> 00:47:09,517
From what?

662
00:47:12,050 --> 00:47:13,700
Who are you so afraid of?

663
00:47:26,267 --> 00:47:27,900
Third time in jail.

664
00:47:29,900 --> 00:47:31,142
Four.

665
00:47:39,548 --> 00:47:42,051
And here we are again.

666
00:47:42,792 --> 00:47:44,251
Face to face.

667
00:47:46,732 --> 00:47:48,582
That's a face. That's, uh...

668
00:47:49,634 --> 00:47:50,786
That's a big face.

669
00:47:50,910 --> 00:47:52,660
Why are you just a floating head?

670
00:47:52,941 --> 00:47:54,984
Maybe you can walk
us through this, Darren.

671
00:47:55,050 --> 00:47:58,017
You left Darren to die
in the quantum realm.

672
00:47:59,700 --> 00:48:01,275
But the Conqueror found me.

673
00:48:02,001 --> 00:48:03,462
Rebuilt me.

674
00:48:03,551 --> 00:48:05,551
Made me the ultimate weapon.

675
00:48:06,025 --> 00:48:09,259
A mechanized organism
designed only for killing.

676
00:48:09,275 --> 00:48:10,642
Oh, M.O.D.O.K!

677
00:48:11,312 --> 00:48:14,157
Oh, a mo... Oh, I get it.
It's an acronym.

678
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:16,134
It's an acronym.

679
00:48:16,184 --> 00:48:19,189
Mechanized Organism
Designed Only for Killing.

680
00:48:20,614 --> 00:48:22,301
Actually, that's MODOFK.

681
00:48:22,326 --> 00:48:23,949
I bet you thought you'd
seen the last of me.

682
00:48:23,974 --> 00:48:26,332
Just now noticing the baby legs.

683
00:48:26,637 --> 00:48:28,637
- They're not baby legs.
- Little bit like a bjorn.

684
00:48:28,662 --> 00:48:30,462
You think you're so smart.

685
00:48:30,864 --> 00:48:32,183
Scott Lang.

686
00:48:32,208 --> 00:48:33,888
The man who took
everything from me.

687
00:48:33,950 --> 00:48:35,489
Who stole my whole life.

688
00:48:35,725 --> 00:48:37,036
But I did it.

689
00:48:38,250 --> 00:48:39,700
I got you here.

690
00:48:40,025 --> 00:48:41,700
I found your signal, Cassie.

691
00:48:42,293 --> 00:48:43,401
Thanks for that, by the way.

692
00:48:43,426 --> 00:48:44,638
Couldn't have done it without you.

693
00:48:47,903 --> 00:48:50,184
You're looking at
a man set free.

694
00:48:50,951 --> 00:48:55,270
I've created so much more here
than you could possibly imagine.

695
00:48:55,737 --> 00:48:58,293
All for him.

696
00:49:01,118 --> 00:49:04,052
I wasn't the only one stranded
in the quantum realm.

697
00:49:07,645 --> 00:49:09,340
What is this place?

698
00:49:10,698 --> 00:49:12,669
He said he was a traveler.

699
00:49:12,802 --> 00:49:15,958
A scientist who crashed off-course.

700
00:49:23,263 --> 00:49:28,286
He had a ship beyond
anything I had ever seen.

701
00:49:29,027 --> 00:49:31,832
A ship that could
travel the multiverse.

702
00:49:32,248 --> 00:49:33,598
The multiverse?

703
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:38,700
As in alternate dimensions,
parallel realities?

704
00:49:39,106 --> 00:49:41,099
I didn't believe it at first.

705
00:49:43,161 --> 00:49:44,700
But it's real.

706
00:49:45,481 --> 00:49:47,684
Just like we theorized.

707
00:49:49,519 --> 00:49:51,591
Can this take us home?

708
00:49:53,394 --> 00:49:55,099
It can take you anywhere.

709
00:50:13,938 --> 00:50:16,430
I've never met anyone like him.

710
00:50:18,220 --> 00:50:21,635
He felt so lost.

711
00:50:23,450 --> 00:50:25,181
I guess we both were.

712
00:50:25,775 --> 00:50:27,510
But we had a way out.

713
00:50:29,408 --> 00:50:34,900
We tried everything to recharge
his ship's energy core.

714
00:50:40,090 --> 00:50:41,408
Nothing worked.

715
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:48,150
But after so many years alone,
it was nice to have a friend.

716
00:50:49,076 --> 00:50:51,009
I lied to Hope.

717
00:50:55,100 --> 00:50:57,135
I told her I was coming home.

718
00:51:00,875 --> 00:51:03,189
I can see her by the door

719
00:51:05,213 --> 00:51:06,766
waiting for me.

720
00:51:10,796 --> 00:51:12,689
That's the last thing I did.

721
00:51:14,862 --> 00:51:16,236
It was lie to her.

722
00:51:19,814 --> 00:51:22,064
I just thought I'd had more time.

723
00:51:26,848 --> 00:51:28,369
I can give that to you.

724
00:51:30,077 --> 00:51:31,166
Time.

725
00:51:35,114 --> 00:51:36,791
It's not what you think it is.

726
00:51:40,713 --> 00:51:41,978
It's a cage.

727
00:51:43,489 --> 00:51:47,353
It does everything
it can to break you.

728
00:51:50,277 --> 00:51:53,720
It's not until you free yourself
from it that you see...

729
00:51:54,671 --> 00:51:58,439
Just how small it always was.

730
00:52:04,157 --> 00:52:05,978
We are going to
get out of here.

731
00:52:09,193 --> 00:52:11,119
She's going to open the door.

732
00:52:12,278 --> 00:52:13,743
And you'll be there.

733
00:52:18,592 --> 00:52:19,642
I promise.

734
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:25,385
Let's get to work.

735
00:52:28,791 --> 00:52:31,853
It took ages, but we did it.

736
00:52:33,650 --> 00:52:35,611
We brought it back to life.

737
00:52:38,127 --> 00:52:39,838
Let's go home.

738
00:52:44,072 --> 00:52:46,283
His ship was neurokinetic,

739
00:52:47,119 --> 00:52:49,119
connected to his thoughts.

740
00:52:52,431 --> 00:52:57,252
When I touched it, I saw his mind.

741
00:52:58,767 --> 00:53:03,173
I felt what he had done.

742
00:53:06,700 --> 00:53:08,447
Entire worlds...

743
00:53:09,127 --> 00:53:11,306
Entire timelines...

744
00:53:11,481 --> 00:53:13,481
Gone,

745
00:53:13,528 --> 00:53:15,588
like they never even existed.

746
00:53:33,900 --> 00:53:35,064
Janet.

747
00:53:39,710 --> 00:53:41,041
We can leave.

748
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:44,408
Right now.

749
00:53:49,219 --> 00:53:50,908
Who is Kang?

750
00:53:56,212 --> 00:53:57,791
Who I need to be.

751
00:54:01,817 --> 00:54:03,617
He didn't crash here.

752
00:54:03,642 --> 00:54:05,700
He was exiled here.

753
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:09,700
Outside space and time.

754
00:54:10,892 --> 00:54:15,291
The only place that
could hold him.

755
00:54:16,201 --> 00:54:18,963
Exiled by who?

756
00:54:19,923 --> 00:54:21,408
I don't know.

757
00:54:23,394 --> 00:54:28,291
But they sabotaged his
ship, and trapped him here

758
00:54:30,700 --> 00:54:34,947
And because of me,
he was getting out.

759
00:54:35,012 --> 00:54:36,470
Janet...

760
00:54:38,829 --> 00:54:40,494
Stay away.

761
00:54:45,765 --> 00:54:47,634
You saved my life.

762
00:54:52,814 --> 00:54:54,548
I made a promise.

763
00:55:01,229 --> 00:55:03,127
Just let me take you home.

764
00:55:04,575 --> 00:55:05,736
And then?

765
00:55:07,900 --> 00:55:09,650
What are you going to do?

766
00:55:20,900 --> 00:55:22,033
Win.

767
00:55:40,443 --> 00:55:43,638
I told you. Time isn't
what you think.

768
00:55:46,068 --> 00:55:50,419
I can make it so
you never left her.

769
00:55:51,863 --> 00:55:54,818
Hope is going to
open the door...

770
00:55:56,146 --> 00:55:57,826
And you'll be there.

771
00:55:58,833 --> 00:56:01,178
And how many worlds will die?

772
00:56:02,600 --> 00:56:04,404
If you get out.

773
00:56:05,373 --> 00:56:06,935
Not yours.

774
00:56:08,654 --> 00:56:10,209
She'll never know.

775
00:56:15,006 --> 00:56:17,607
Don't you want to see
your daughter again?

776
00:56:19,662 --> 00:56:21,724
I can't let you leave.

777
00:56:23,833 --> 00:56:26,099
Why do you think
you can stop me?

778
00:56:43,614 --> 00:56:45,359
Give it to me, Janet.

779
00:56:46,473 --> 00:56:48,070
Give it to me!

780
00:56:48,340 --> 00:56:51,340
I couldn't beat him,
he was too powerful.

781
00:56:52,234 --> 00:56:53,585
What did you do?

782
00:56:57,655 --> 00:56:59,140
I'm sorry, Hope.

783
00:57:01,452 --> 00:57:02,702
No!

784
00:57:29,715 --> 00:57:33,700
I blew up his core, cut
him off from time.

785
00:57:34,307 --> 00:57:37,192
And trapped us both
down here forever.

786
00:57:39,410 --> 00:57:41,019
But I gave him back enough.

787
00:57:41,512 --> 00:57:43,307
Now that he had his suit back,

788
00:57:43,332 --> 00:57:47,004
He became what he always was...

789
00:57:47,340 --> 00:57:49,125
a Conqueror.

790
00:57:49,356 --> 00:57:52,026
He's got weapons and technology

791
00:57:52,051 --> 00:57:55,848
centuries beyond anything
we can dream of.

792
00:57:56,481 --> 00:58:00,301
He took his prison
and made it his empire.

793
00:58:01,420 --> 00:58:07,418
I spent years fighting him,
running from him, hiding from him.

794
00:58:09,087 --> 00:58:10,707
And then you saved me.

795
00:58:13,810 --> 00:58:15,098
You brought me home.

796
00:58:16,830 --> 00:58:18,238
But I didn't deserve it.

797
00:58:19,410 --> 00:58:24,950
I unleashed a monster on
this place and ran away.

798
00:58:25,418 --> 00:58:29,231
Janet, you couldn't have known.

799
00:58:31,145 --> 00:58:33,192
I'm sorry I never told you.

800
00:58:34,252 --> 00:58:36,199
I just wanted to forget.

801
00:58:37,646 --> 00:58:39,864
I just wanted to be
your mom again.

802
00:58:45,376 --> 00:58:48,231
I'm so sorry you had to
go through all of that alone.

803
00:58:49,303 --> 00:58:51,910
But you are not alone now.

804
00:58:55,461 --> 00:58:57,004
We'll stop him together.

805
00:58:57,739 --> 00:58:59,739
He's after the core.

806
00:59:00,535 --> 00:59:03,010
But he needs Pym Particles to reach it.

807
00:59:03,035 --> 00:59:06,473
And if he's got Scott and Cassie,
he's got Pym Particles.

808
00:59:06,498 --> 00:59:08,498
- And a headstart.
- Exactly.

809
00:59:08,645 --> 00:59:09,700
We got to get out of here.

810
00:59:09,766 --> 00:59:10,766
Hope...

811
00:59:10,791 --> 00:59:12,465
He cannot get out.

812
00:59:33,913 --> 00:59:35,625
You're an interesting man...

813
00:59:39,145 --> 00:59:40,187
Scott Lang.

814
00:59:41,266 --> 00:59:46,450
Um, I don't know who you are,
but you've made a big mistake.

815
00:59:46,979 --> 00:59:48,250
Okay?

816
00:59:48,956 --> 00:59:50,328
I'm an Avenger.

817
00:59:51,311 --> 00:59:53,031
I've called the other Avengers.

818
00:59:53,179 --> 00:59:54,734
You're an Avenger?

819
00:59:56,710 --> 00:59:58,461
Have I killed you before?

820
00:59:59,245 --> 01:00:00,530
What?

821
01:00:01,336 --> 01:00:03,773
They all bleed together after a while.

822
01:00:05,775 --> 01:00:07,398
You're not the one
with the hammer?

823
01:00:07,423 --> 01:00:08,883
That's Thor.

824
01:00:10,590 --> 01:00:13,023
We get confused a lot.
Similar body types ---

825
01:00:13,271 --> 01:00:14,430
who are you?

826
01:00:16,344 --> 01:00:17,757
Just a man...

827
01:00:18,250 --> 01:00:21,617
who's lost a lot of time, like you.

828
01:00:23,814 --> 01:00:25,859
But we can help
each other with that.

829
01:00:27,687 --> 01:00:29,637
M.O.D.O.K tells me
you're a good thief.

830
01:00:29,964 --> 01:00:32,250
Yeah, he stole
something from me.

831
01:00:33,973 --> 01:00:36,973
Do not speak when
I'm in the room.

832
01:00:44,301 --> 01:00:46,948
Got to say, Janet was
a lot more helpful.

833
01:00:47,472 --> 01:00:48,987
You know Janet too?

834
01:00:50,090 --> 01:00:52,167
Does everyone down
here know Janet?

835
01:00:53,622 --> 01:00:55,253
She didn't tell you about me?

836
01:00:59,921 --> 01:01:01,659
I guess that's not a surprise.

837
01:01:04,100 --> 01:01:06,573
Janet stole something from me.

838
01:01:06,950 --> 01:01:09,519
My ticket out of here.

839
01:01:12,341 --> 01:01:14,816
And you are the only
one who can steal it back.

840
01:01:15,612 --> 01:01:17,129
And why would I do that?

841
01:01:17,663 --> 01:01:19,613
Because you want
to get out of here.

842
01:01:20,448 --> 01:01:24,870
And I need to
get out of here.

843
01:01:26,972 --> 01:01:28,622
Because I know how it ends.

844
01:01:29,039 --> 01:01:30,761
How what ends?

845
01:01:34,129 --> 01:01:35,417
All of it.

846
01:01:38,667 --> 01:01:42,230
I don't live in a straight line.

847
01:01:44,738 --> 01:01:46,144
And with time...

848
01:01:47,151 --> 01:01:50,386
It's hard, not to skip to the end.

849
01:01:52,229 --> 01:01:55,073
So, if you want to stop
what's coming,

850
01:01:55,191 --> 01:01:58,749
and trust me, you do...

851
01:02:01,095 --> 01:02:03,131
I am the only shot you have.

852
01:02:03,886 --> 01:02:05,419
What's coming?

853
01:02:07,503 --> 01:02:08,600
Me.

854
01:02:10,294 --> 01:02:12,975
A lot of me.

855
01:02:16,866 --> 01:02:20,975
They exiled me down here.

856
01:02:24,113 --> 01:02:25,616
They're afraid of me.

857
01:02:31,260 --> 01:02:34,944
But I'm the man who
can get you home.

858
01:02:43,081 --> 01:02:46,647
So, do we have a deal?

859
01:02:49,957 --> 01:02:52,085
No, I don't think we do.

860
01:03:01,342 --> 01:03:02,256
Dad!

861
01:03:02,281 --> 01:03:04,374
Let me make this easy for you.

862
01:03:05,014 --> 01:03:09,436
You bring me what I need, or I will
kill your daughter in front of you.

863
01:03:09,461 --> 01:03:11,530
Then, make you
relive that moment,

864
01:03:11,555 --> 01:03:14,708
Over and over again,
in time, endlessly,

865
01:03:14,756 --> 01:03:17,546
until you beg me to kill you.

866
01:03:18,800 --> 01:03:20,335
Do you understand?

867
01:03:23,913 --> 01:03:25,397
Don't do this.

868
01:03:28,124 --> 01:03:31,046
I'm a man who likes
to be understood.

869
01:03:34,139 --> 01:03:35,186
Dad!

870
01:03:36,467 --> 01:03:38,327
Don't listen to him.

871
01:03:40,163 --> 01:03:41,364
No! No! Look,

872
01:03:41,389 --> 01:03:42,700
we can talk about this.

873
01:03:42,700 --> 01:03:43,700
Don't do it!

874
01:03:43,889 --> 01:03:45,428
You really should do it.

875
01:03:45,645 --> 01:03:46,741
Please.

876
01:03:47,952 --> 01:03:50,460
That's my
daughter! Please...

877
01:03:50,485 --> 01:03:53,147
Do you want her to live or
do you want her to die?

878
01:03:53,172 --> 01:03:54,172
Please!

879
01:03:54,426 --> 01:03:55,702
Do you think I'm lying?

880
01:03:56,669 --> 01:03:58,897
Do I look like
a liar to you?

881
01:03:59,889 --> 01:04:00,913
Stop!

882
01:04:01,278 --> 01:04:03,139
- Dad!
- I'll do it! I'll do it.

883
01:04:03,164 --> 01:04:06,592
I'll do it, just let her go!
Let her go! Let her go!

884
01:04:17,131 --> 01:04:19,084
You're out of your league...

885
01:04:20,484 --> 01:04:21,725
Ant-Man.

886
01:04:27,707 --> 01:04:29,373
Just be glad I need you.

887
01:04:42,776 --> 01:04:46,239
Don't touch her again.

888
01:04:46,606 --> 01:04:48,482
Then give me what I need.

889
01:04:49,926 --> 01:04:51,544
Where is it?

890
01:05:32,481 --> 01:05:34,307
What is that?

891
01:05:34,332 --> 01:05:36,801
It was a multiversal engine core.

892
01:05:38,239 --> 01:05:42,192
A power source that could take
you anywhere in space and time.

893
01:05:43,606 --> 01:05:45,036
Then Janet blew it up.

894
01:05:49,531 --> 01:05:52,421
- It's in that?
- It is that.

895
01:05:53,117 --> 01:05:55,257
And we have to
get to the center.

896
01:05:56,109 --> 01:05:57,648
That's good to know.

897
01:05:59,257 --> 01:06:02,398
You'll have to shrink down and
pass through the eye of the storm.

898
01:06:02,700 --> 01:06:07,121
Once you're inside, find the
core and size it back down.

899
01:06:07,146 --> 01:06:08,700
What does it look like?

900
01:06:08,700 --> 01:06:11,161
When I steal something, I
usually know what I'm stealing.

901
01:06:11,186 --> 01:06:12,826
You'll know it when you see it.

902
01:06:13,076 --> 01:06:15,217
Get in and out as
fast as you can.

903
01:06:15,598 --> 01:06:19,225
The longer you're in there, the
more your mind will come undone.

904
01:06:21,583 --> 01:06:22,858
Better hurry.

905
01:06:27,139 --> 01:06:28,428
I'm sorry.

906
01:06:29,035 --> 01:06:30,529
This is all my fault.

907
01:06:34,256 --> 01:06:35,264
No.

908
01:06:36,490 --> 01:06:38,279
I messed up.

909
01:06:38,803 --> 01:06:42,959
Cassie, my whole life happened
because I messed up.

910
01:06:44,250 --> 01:06:47,232
The only thing I didn't
mess up, is you.

911
01:06:50,154 --> 01:06:51,264
Dad!

912
01:06:52,028 --> 01:06:54,506
It's okay. It's okay.

913
01:06:57,014 --> 01:06:58,700
I love you, Peanut.

914
01:06:59,506 --> 01:07:00,998
I love you, too.

915
01:07:44,664 --> 01:07:47,364
Okay. I'm in.

916
01:07:50,450 --> 01:07:52,450
Darren, can you hear me?

917
01:07:52,669 --> 01:07:53,669
Darren?

918
01:07:54,850 --> 01:07:55,873
Darren?

919
01:07:58,200 --> 01:07:59,875
M.O.D.O.K, can you hear me?

920
01:07:59,900 --> 01:08:00,967
What?

921
01:08:01,660 --> 01:08:02,660
I'm in.

922
01:08:02,873 --> 01:08:05,233
- Okay.
- Okay, so...

923
01:08:05,258 --> 01:08:07,258
What do I do?
What's the plan?

924
01:08:08,019 --> 01:08:09,019
Don't die?

925
01:08:10,418 --> 01:08:12,428
Thanks. Big help, M.O.D.O.K.

926
01:08:13,020 --> 01:08:14,358
Do you see it?

927
01:08:15,675 --> 01:08:17,131
Yeah, I see it.

928
01:08:21,824 --> 01:08:23,278
I'm heading in.

929
01:08:26,700 --> 01:08:27,700
What the hell?

930
01:08:27,700 --> 01:08:28,700
What the hell?

931
01:08:28,700 --> 01:08:29,700
What the hell?

932
01:08:29,825 --> 01:08:32,700
I told you Scott, getting in
was just the beginning.

933
01:08:32,700 --> 01:08:33,811
You never said that.

934
01:08:33,959 --> 01:08:35,459
Why am I looking at another me?

935
01:08:35,484 --> 01:08:37,137
I'm not another me.
You're another me.

936
01:08:37,162 --> 01:08:38,192
You just came out...

937
01:08:38,217 --> 01:08:39,956
Why am I looking at another me?

938
01:08:39,981 --> 01:08:42,981
You're looking at the
possibility of another you.

939
01:08:43,250 --> 01:08:44,955
You're in a probability storm.

940
01:08:45,150 --> 01:08:47,406
What does any of that mean?

941
01:08:47,431 --> 01:08:49,172
- You don't know?
- Why would I know?

942
01:08:49,197 --> 01:08:50,414
Because you got me in here!

943
01:08:50,439 --> 01:08:51,867
Oh, so I am the
real one, huh?

944
01:08:51,892 --> 01:08:52,985
No, I didn't say that.

945
01:08:54,236 --> 01:08:59,078
- What the hell?
- What the hell?!

946
01:09:00,117 --> 01:09:01,117
What is this place?

947
01:09:01,142 --> 01:09:03,213
It's a probability storm.

948
01:09:03,720 --> 01:09:06,603
Every choice you could
make, existing all at once.

949
01:09:06,628 --> 01:09:07,681
What is he saying?
What is he saying?

950
01:09:08,338 --> 01:09:11,822
You're inside Schrödinger's box,
and you're the cat.

951
01:09:11,850 --> 01:09:12,700
- That doesn't make sense.
- Oh, I get it.

952
01:09:13,088 --> 01:09:13,985
Nobody move!

953
01:09:14,010 --> 01:09:15,211
Alright? Nobody move.

954
01:09:15,236 --> 01:09:16,700
Why should we listen to you?

955
01:09:16,700 --> 01:09:17,825
You're not even the real one.

956
01:09:17,850 --> 01:09:18,700
- Wait, I'm not?
- Who's the real one?

957
01:09:18,700 --> 01:09:19,700
I am the real one!

958
01:09:22,262 --> 01:09:23,619
I'm the real one!

959
01:09:23,644 --> 01:09:24,983
Guys, hey, relax.

960
01:09:25,008 --> 01:09:26,008
Take it easy.

961
01:09:26,033 --> 01:09:26,800
Breathe.

962
01:09:26,825 --> 01:09:28,036
We'll figure this out.

963
01:09:28,061 --> 01:09:28,911
Together.

964
01:09:29,276 --> 01:09:30,276
Who are you?

965
01:09:30,301 --> 01:09:31,939
Why are you dressed like that?

966
01:09:32,630 --> 01:09:34,439
Because I work at
Baskin Robbins.

967
01:09:34,818 --> 01:09:36,166
This is my uniform.

968
01:09:36,191 --> 01:09:37,463
These are normal clothes.

969
01:09:37,700 --> 01:09:39,244
Why are you
dressed like that?

970
01:09:39,769 --> 01:09:40,769
Enough!

971
01:09:40,803 --> 01:09:41,986
Let's do this!

972
01:09:50,033 --> 01:09:51,533
Oh, we're all gonna die.

973
01:09:55,377 --> 01:09:56,422
Wait...

974
01:09:56,447 --> 01:09:57,963
Wait, no, no!

975
01:10:00,829 --> 01:10:02,939
I've got a read on Scott.

976
01:10:17,534 --> 01:10:18,620
Get out of the way!

977
01:10:18,684 --> 01:10:21,010
- Mom, what is this?
- What are you doing?

978
01:10:21,077 --> 01:10:21,917
Don't look at them.

979
01:10:21,942 --> 01:10:23,162
They're just possibilities.

980
01:10:24,245 --> 01:10:25,732
They're not you.

981
01:10:25,845 --> 01:10:27,845
Scott, where are you?

982
01:10:31,982 --> 01:10:33,186
Why am I here?

983
01:10:33,975 --> 01:10:36,014
Do it! It'll work this time.

984
01:10:36,175 --> 01:10:37,740
What are you... Wait,
wait, no, no, no!

985
01:10:37,765 --> 01:10:38,765
I got this.

986
01:10:38,790 --> 01:10:39,790
You got this, Scott!

987
01:10:45,378 --> 01:10:47,573
- I got it.
- No, I got it.

988
01:10:52,424 --> 01:10:53,760
Scott, where are you?

989
01:10:54,332 --> 01:10:55,332
Scott!

990
01:10:58,324 --> 01:11:00,189
Where are you, Scott?

991
01:11:02,143 --> 01:11:03,948
Ow, my neck...

992
01:11:08,901 --> 01:11:10,403
- We're dead.
- We're gonna die.

993
01:11:11,374 --> 01:11:12,374
Dad.

994
01:11:15,276 --> 01:11:16,612
Come back.

995
01:11:17,135 --> 01:11:18,213
Dad...

996
01:11:19,151 --> 01:11:21,956
If you can hear me, come back.

997
01:11:22,744 --> 01:11:24,127
Just come back.

998
01:11:24,826 --> 01:11:26,103
Don't give up.

999
01:11:27,095 --> 01:11:29,645
Dad, just come
back one more time.

1000
01:11:30,078 --> 01:11:31,120
Please.

1001
01:11:31,706 --> 01:11:32,700
Come back.

1002
01:11:33,456 --> 01:11:35,065
- What is he doing?
- Get him up!

1003
01:11:35,090 --> 01:11:36,243
- Get him up.
- Grab him, grab him.

1004
01:11:36,268 --> 01:11:37,115
Come on.

1005
01:11:37,140 --> 01:11:38,034
Let's go.

1006
01:11:38,059 --> 01:11:39,059
Let's go.

1007
01:11:39,306 --> 01:11:40,306
Come on, lift him.

1008
01:11:40,331 --> 01:11:41,331
Climb.

1009
01:11:41,356 --> 01:11:42,356
I've got you.

1010
01:11:43,794 --> 01:11:45,794
Come on.

1011
01:11:48,878 --> 01:11:51,424
Come on guys, everyone!

1012
01:11:52,245 --> 01:11:53,700
What are you doing?

1013
01:11:54,049 --> 01:11:55,700
How are you
able to do that?

1014
01:11:55,747 --> 01:11:56,987
I'll tell you how.

1015
01:11:58,307 --> 01:11:59,700
We all want the same thing.

1016
01:11:59,700 --> 01:12:01,135
Come on, work together!

1017
01:12:01,853 --> 01:12:03,284
And I'm coming, Cassie.

1018
01:12:03,309 --> 01:12:04,309
C'mon, we're
doing it for Cassie!

1019
01:12:12,085 --> 01:12:13,700
Go get her, pal.

1020
01:12:17,359 --> 01:12:18,675
Go, go!

1021
01:12:18,700 --> 01:12:20,429
Everyone, let's go!

1022
01:12:23,007 --> 01:12:24,132
Come on!

1023
01:12:50,933 --> 01:12:52,473
What?

1024
01:12:55,635 --> 01:12:56,380
No.

1025
01:12:56,405 --> 01:12:57,481
What happened?
Did it work?

1026
01:12:57,506 --> 01:12:59,506
Sorry, buddy!

1027
01:13:11,184 --> 01:13:13,184
Hope, are you real?

1028
01:13:13,761 --> 01:13:15,155
I'm real.

1029
01:13:15,551 --> 01:13:16,866
Then let's do this.

1030
01:13:21,734 --> 01:13:22,788
Are you ready?

1031
01:13:23,128 --> 01:13:24,128
Ready.

1032
01:14:09,989 --> 01:14:12,301
Come on, we got to get
that thing out of here.

1033
01:14:12,481 --> 01:14:14,481
No, no, no. Wait.
He's got Cassie.

1034
01:14:15,036 --> 01:14:16,026
What?

1035
01:14:16,051 --> 01:14:16,925
Scott.

1036
01:14:17,231 --> 01:14:20,278
- Janet.
- Give that to me. We have to go now.

1037
01:14:20,309 --> 01:14:21,825
No, he's got Cassie.

1038
01:14:21,850 --> 01:14:24,153
We will save her, I promise
you we will save her.

1039
01:14:25,653 --> 01:14:27,700
But, you cannot
give that to him.

1040
01:14:28,079 --> 01:14:29,629
I wouldn't trust her.

1041
01:14:33,279 --> 01:14:34,911
Janet has a way of..

1042
01:14:38,075 --> 01:14:39,755
changing her mind.

1043
01:14:46,270 --> 01:14:47,567
Hello...

1044
01:14:47,913 --> 01:14:49,020
Jellybean.

1045
01:14:55,160 --> 01:14:56,317
So...

1046
01:14:59,895 --> 01:15:01,380
What's it gonna be, Scott?

1047
01:15:04,973 --> 01:15:07,200
Well, well...
if it isn't

1048
01:15:08,481 --> 01:15:11,130
my old mentor.

1049
01:15:16,051 --> 01:15:17,200
Hi, Hank.

1050
01:15:20,348 --> 01:15:21,700
Darren?

1051
01:15:21,975 --> 01:15:24,700
Didn't expect to see your
protegé again after all this time?

1052
01:15:24,700 --> 01:15:26,341
Holy shit, Darren.

1053
01:15:27,156 --> 01:15:28,606
What happened to you?

1054
01:15:28,653 --> 01:15:31,653
I am the ultimate weapon!

1055
01:15:41,700 --> 01:15:43,478
Do I need to take it?

1056
01:15:43,558 --> 01:15:45,071
Where is my daughter?

1057
01:15:46,700 --> 01:15:48,095
Scott.

1058
01:15:49,700 --> 01:15:50,774
Don't.

1059
01:15:51,442 --> 01:15:53,442
We had a deal.

1060
01:15:54,168 --> 01:15:55,703
She'll be fine without you.

1061
01:16:21,059 --> 01:16:23,059
So long, Hank!

1062
01:16:30,449 --> 01:16:31,541
Henry!

1063
01:16:38,291 --> 01:16:40,700
You left me right here to die.

1064
01:16:44,700 --> 01:16:46,700
Let's see how they do.

1065
01:17:47,114 --> 01:17:48,420
What did you see?

1066
01:17:57,420 --> 01:18:00,645
We didn't really get a chance
to talk about it last time.

1067
01:18:02,633 --> 01:18:04,068
But I always wondered...

1068
01:18:07,494 --> 01:18:09,644
When you touched my mind,

1069
01:18:20,895 --> 01:18:22,645
what did you see?

1070
01:18:23,453 --> 01:18:24,653
A monster,

1071
01:18:25,963 --> 01:18:27,613
who thinks he's a god.

1072
01:18:28,010 --> 01:18:29,660
When you can see time

1073
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,700
the way I do, you don't
get to close your eyes.

1074
01:18:32,903 --> 01:18:35,441
And you're the
only one who sees?

1075
01:18:35,473 --> 01:18:39,012
I am the only
one that can see

1076
01:18:39,085 --> 01:18:40,207
it's broken.

1077
01:18:40,387 --> 01:18:41,582
And who broke it?

1078
01:18:44,292 --> 01:18:45,387
I did.

1079
01:18:46,554 --> 01:18:49,527
Every version of me.

1080
01:18:50,715 --> 01:18:55,246
My variants, throughout
the multiverse...

1081
01:18:56,687 --> 01:18:59,637
play with time like children.

1082
01:19:02,168 --> 01:19:06,488
But I saw how it ends.

1083
01:19:06,543 --> 01:19:12,058
I saw their chaos
spreading across realities.

1084
01:19:13,567 --> 01:19:16,316
Universes colliding.

1085
01:19:17,175 --> 01:19:19,191
Endless incursions.

1086
01:19:19,875 --> 01:19:21,879
I saw the multiverse...

1087
01:19:22,910 --> 01:19:24,910
that it was dying.

1088
01:19:26,004 --> 01:19:27,700
All because of them.

1089
01:19:28,902 --> 01:19:30,700
So I took control.

1090
01:19:31,176 --> 01:19:33,176
You mean you started a war.

1091
01:19:33,793 --> 01:19:35,973
And now you want to
wipe away any universe

1092
01:19:35,998 --> 01:19:37,848
that's a threat to you.

1093
01:19:38,355 --> 01:19:39,948
That's what monsters do.

1094
01:19:39,973 --> 01:19:43,277
That's what conquerors do.

1095
01:19:43,669 --> 01:19:46,176
They burn the broken world.

1096
01:19:47,395 --> 01:19:50,160
And they make a new one.

1097
01:19:50,528 --> 01:19:53,528
You don't care about
saving anything or anyone.

1098
01:19:55,200 --> 01:19:58,066
You only want revenge
because they beat you.

1099
01:19:58,462 --> 01:19:59,512
Because you lost.

1100
01:19:59,537 --> 01:20:01,537
I have lost.

1101
01:20:03,332 --> 01:20:07,700
You have no idea what I've lost.

1102
01:20:09,100 --> 01:20:12,700
And I will burn
them out of time,

1103
01:20:13,019 --> 01:20:14,604
for what they've done to me.

1104
01:20:15,395 --> 01:20:19,395
You'll be wiping
out entire timelines,

1105
01:20:20,013 --> 01:20:23,129
murdering trillions of people.

1106
01:20:24,598 --> 01:20:26,848
I wish that mattered, Janet.

1107
01:20:48,681 --> 01:20:50,556
Oh, God, what am I doing.

1108
01:21:01,275 --> 01:21:02,400
What?

1109
01:21:06,649 --> 01:21:07,892
Hank.

1110
01:21:11,240 --> 01:21:13,164
Are these your ants?

1111
01:21:13,333 --> 01:21:14,570
From the ant farm?

1112
01:21:14,595 --> 01:21:16,595
Yes, Scott, they're my ants.

1113
01:21:16,783 --> 01:21:18,683
How did you find
them down here?

1114
01:21:19,550 --> 01:21:22,700
I've been picking up strange
signals ever since we crashed.

1115
01:21:24,459 --> 01:21:27,242
First I thought maybe
it was a malfunction,

1116
01:21:27,267 --> 01:21:29,062
some kind of interference?

1117
01:21:29,102 --> 01:21:30,875
What is that?

1118
01:21:31,276 --> 01:21:32,351
But it wasn't.

1119
01:21:33,717 --> 01:21:34,875
It was the ants.

1120
01:21:36,714 --> 01:21:39,614
They were reaching
out the whole time.

1121
01:21:41,254 --> 01:21:45,000
Apparently they passed through
some sort of time dilation.

1122
01:21:45,176 --> 01:21:48,391
They lived thousands
of years in a single day.

1123
01:21:48,559 --> 01:21:51,559
Expanding their knowledge, their science...

1124
01:21:51,700 --> 01:21:55,125
Becoming more advanced than
I could have ever thought.

1125
01:21:55,150 --> 01:21:56,700
I didn't find them.

1126
01:21:57,350 --> 01:21:58,700
They found me.

1127
01:22:00,297 --> 01:22:02,562
I told you they were smart.

1128
01:22:04,656 --> 01:22:07,858
They've already built
something of a technocratic,

1129
01:22:07,883 --> 01:22:09,758
class-two civilization.

1130
01:22:09,926 --> 01:22:13,272
I mean, I know socialism
is a charged word,

1131
01:22:13,297 --> 01:22:15,172
but we can learn
a lot from these...

1132
01:22:15,197 --> 01:22:16,226
Dad.

1133
01:22:16,984 --> 01:22:18,700
Yeah, they're my ants.

1134
01:22:18,810 --> 01:22:20,885
And ants don't give up.

1135
01:22:20,910 --> 01:22:22,414
I don't care who this guy is.

1136
01:22:22,439 --> 01:22:24,898
I don't care what he can
do, I'm getting Cassie.

1137
01:22:25,029 --> 01:22:27,629
So, how do we even
the odds against Kang?

1138
01:22:30,742 --> 01:22:32,273
We've got some ideas.

1139
01:22:32,298 --> 01:22:33,351
What are you thinking?

1140
01:22:33,376 --> 01:22:36,376
Well, as a great
writer once said...

1141
01:22:37,503 --> 01:22:39,503
There's always
room to grow.

1142
01:22:41,961 --> 01:22:43,562
You read my book?

1143
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:47,172
Every goddamn word.

1144
01:22:49,914 --> 01:22:51,614
Come on. Let's go to work.

1145
01:23:04,148 --> 01:23:06,172
Hey! I'm sorry.

1146
01:23:06,470 --> 01:23:08,172
That was probably terrifying.

1147
01:23:08,197 --> 01:23:09,969
What are you doing here?

1148
01:23:10,200 --> 01:23:11,476
I'm rescuing you.

1149
01:23:11,934 --> 01:23:12,934
How?

1150
01:23:14,478 --> 01:23:16,000
That's a good question.

1151
01:23:16,567 --> 01:23:20,148
Does this thing have
like a key or a card?

1152
01:23:20,187 --> 01:23:21,481
Like a room key?

1153
01:23:21,606 --> 01:23:22,606
You know, like a...

1154
01:23:24,815 --> 01:23:25,818
Shit.

1155
01:23:33,326 --> 01:23:34,700
Jump and tap.

1156
01:23:43,906 --> 01:23:47,700
Jentorra, I'm sorry I
got your people hurt.

1157
01:23:49,479 --> 01:23:50,867
How can I help?

1158
01:23:56,867 --> 01:23:58,413
Let's hurt them back.

1159
01:23:58,438 --> 01:24:00,430
Damn, your cool.

1160
01:24:01,266 --> 01:24:02,485
Do you have a plan?

1161
01:24:02,510 --> 01:24:04,070
Freeing you was
basically my plan.

1162
01:24:04,842 --> 01:24:05,842
Do you have a plan?

1163
01:24:05,899 --> 01:24:08,500
We need to get a message out
to anyone who can still fight.

1164
01:24:08,700 --> 01:24:10,500
Then free our people from
the detention cells below

1165
01:24:10,525 --> 01:24:12,188
and launch a counteroffense from within.

1166
01:24:12,213 --> 01:24:14,477
Yeah, you have a plan. So,
how do we get the message out?

1167
01:24:14,502 --> 01:24:16,789
- Follow me.
- Okay, great.

1168
01:24:21,242 --> 01:24:24,274
I built an empire
down here, Janet.

1169
01:24:26,539 --> 01:24:28,500
And I'm taking it with me.

1170
01:24:44,227 --> 01:24:47,141
You really should have let me
out when you had the chance.

1171
01:24:56,419 --> 01:24:59,419
History is not written.

1172
01:25:01,550 --> 01:25:03,700
It is forged.

1173
01:25:03,700 --> 01:25:05,219
Today, we are saved.

1174
01:25:06,250 --> 01:25:11,375
From this fortress, I will take my
revenge on those who banished me.

1175
01:25:12,485 --> 01:25:16,047
Today, we conquer eternity.

1176
01:25:16,741 --> 01:25:19,100
And the dynasty of Kang...

1177
01:25:22,555 --> 01:25:23,700
Hello?

1178
01:25:23,750 --> 01:25:25,227
Is this working?

1179
01:25:25,252 --> 01:25:26,252
Cassie?

1180
01:25:26,535 --> 01:25:28,242
I can't tell if it's working.

1181
01:25:29,563 --> 01:25:31,305
Okay, I think we're on.

1182
01:25:31,330 --> 01:25:32,760
I'll hold them off.
Get the message out.

1183
01:25:32,785 --> 01:25:34,555
I thought you were
getting the message out.

1184
01:25:36,574 --> 01:25:37,574
Now!

1185
01:25:38,514 --> 01:25:39,477
We're inside!

1186
01:25:39,539 --> 01:25:41,078
We've breached the tower.

1187
01:25:41,103 --> 01:25:42,297
I'm with Jentorra.

1188
01:25:42,322 --> 01:25:43,661
He's not invincible.

1189
01:25:49,625 --> 01:25:53,352
I know it might
feel like it's too late.

1190
01:25:53,700 --> 01:25:57,110
Like, all we do is just lose.

1191
01:25:57,153 --> 01:25:59,153
But the family I lost,

1192
01:25:59,473 --> 01:26:01,211
taught me to keep fighting.

1193
01:26:01,480 --> 01:26:03,812
And if they were
here, they would, too.

1194
01:26:04,152 --> 01:26:06,152
We need to look
out for the little guy.

1195
01:26:06,660 --> 01:26:08,039
My dad taught me that.

1196
01:26:08,566 --> 01:26:10,566
Because when people needed help,

1197
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:12,836
he didn't look the other way.

1198
01:26:13,153 --> 01:26:14,281
And neither do we.

1199
01:26:16,590 --> 01:26:17,700
We need to move!

1200
01:26:17,700 --> 01:26:19,270
Come to the tower!

1201
01:26:19,295 --> 01:26:20,295
Fight back!

1202
01:26:20,320 --> 01:26:21,320
I know you've been waiting.

1203
01:26:21,345 --> 01:26:22,745
Now is the time to strike.

1204
01:26:22,770 --> 01:26:24,770
He knows he can't take all of us.

1205
01:26:24,989 --> 01:26:26,121
Come to the tow...

1206
01:26:26,675 --> 01:26:28,675
- Cassie.
- I think I found the signal.

1207
01:26:28,700 --> 01:26:29,700
Mom's gotta be there, too.

1208
01:26:29,700 --> 01:26:31,137
- Let's go!
- I'll drive.

1209
01:26:37,575 --> 01:26:39,192
Find Lang's daughter.

1210
01:26:42,184 --> 01:26:43,590
Kill her.

1211
01:27:02,202 --> 01:27:03,700
Let's go. Let's go.

1212
01:27:03,700 --> 01:27:05,700
If you want to
fight, follow me.

1213
01:27:10,030 --> 01:27:11,700
It's over, Cassie.

1214
01:27:11,766 --> 01:27:12,987
Free the others.

1215
01:27:13,012 --> 01:27:14,012
Go!

1216
01:27:21,395 --> 01:27:22,700
He is gonna see us coming.

1217
01:27:22,700 --> 01:27:24,700
Yeah, I'll make sure of it.

1218
01:27:25,696 --> 01:27:27,262
Begin the launch.

1219
01:28:18,917 --> 01:28:20,878
Your dad's not here, Cassie.

1220
01:28:21,247 --> 01:28:23,198
But I guess that's
not a big surprise.

1221
01:28:46,348 --> 01:28:48,058
Kang!

1222
01:28:48,863 --> 01:28:51,301
We had a deal!

1223
01:28:52,925 --> 01:28:55,746
You took my daughter!

1224
01:28:57,543 --> 01:29:00,700
Holy shit. That's big.

1225
01:29:09,238 --> 01:29:10,700
You lied to me.

1226
01:29:12,247 --> 01:29:14,247
Our word is our vow.

1227
01:29:15,316 --> 01:29:18,167
Without that, we're nothing.

1228
01:29:19,700 --> 01:29:20,700
Bring him down.

1229
01:29:20,700 --> 01:29:21,700
Yes, sir.

1230
01:29:28,379 --> 01:29:29,700
Keep going. I've got them.

1231
01:29:31,512 --> 01:29:33,051
Yeah. Come on!

1232
01:29:47,142 --> 01:29:48,486
There's so many.

1233
01:29:48,511 --> 01:29:50,511
Scott, I can't hold them.

1234
01:30:01,973 --> 01:30:03,046
They came.

1235
01:30:04,809 --> 01:30:06,687
Way to go, Cassie!

1236
01:30:09,145 --> 01:30:10,145
Yes!

1237
01:30:10,700 --> 01:30:12,700
Come on, let's go!

1238
01:30:17,700 --> 01:30:20,062
Revolution!

1239
01:30:32,611 --> 01:30:36,611
- Burn it all down!
- Fight!

1240
01:30:54,700 --> 01:30:55,700
Get down!

1241
01:31:04,465 --> 01:31:05,833
What is the bridge code?

1242
01:31:05,858 --> 01:31:07,614
I'll die first.

1243
01:31:08,020 --> 01:31:09,700
18147.

1244
01:31:10,137 --> 01:31:11,223
Damn.

1245
01:31:26,207 --> 01:31:27,339
You'll need this.

1246
01:31:29,714 --> 01:31:30,714
Hi.

1247
01:31:31,348 --> 01:31:32,699
This is our home!

1248
01:31:33,325 --> 01:31:34,792
Let's take it back!

1249
01:31:47,450 --> 01:31:49,545
I have holes.

1250
01:31:51,250 --> 01:31:53,979
I have holes!

1251
01:32:00,549 --> 01:32:01,854
I didn't know
he could do that.

1252
01:32:11,472 --> 01:32:12,596
Kang!

1253
01:32:13,090 --> 01:32:14,924
Where is she?

1254
01:32:15,159 --> 01:32:16,518
Launch now!

1255
01:32:27,700 --> 01:32:29,205
What is that?

1256
01:32:29,449 --> 01:32:30,846
He's getting out.

1257
01:32:31,301 --> 01:32:32,674
Oh no, he's not!

1258
01:32:40,082 --> 01:32:41,638
Keep him away
from the rings.

1259
01:33:20,872 --> 01:33:21,872
Dad!

1260
01:33:24,700 --> 01:33:26,141
Dad, I'm coming!

1261
01:33:37,700 --> 01:33:38,700
Dad!

1262
01:33:46,926 --> 01:33:48,634
Nowhere left to run.

1263
01:33:57,423 --> 01:33:58,700
Please let this work.

1264
01:34:16,895 --> 01:34:19,567
Hey, where do you think
you're going? Let's go!

1265
01:34:19,715 --> 01:34:20,824
You think this is over?

1266
01:34:20,849 --> 01:34:21,832
Come on! Let's go!

1267
01:34:21,857 --> 01:34:23,551
Darren... stop,

1268
01:34:23,615 --> 01:34:26,700
trying to be whatever this is!

1269
01:34:27,194 --> 01:34:28,644
I don't know what to be.

1270
01:34:30,895 --> 01:34:32,326
Tell me what to be.

1271
01:34:32,351 --> 01:34:34,880
I don't know, just
don't be a dick.

1272
01:34:35,473 --> 01:34:37,029
It's too late.

1273
01:34:37,559 --> 01:34:38,771
Look at me.

1274
01:34:40,311 --> 01:34:41,661
I'm such a dick.

1275
01:34:42,334 --> 01:34:44,794
It's never too late
to stop being a dick.

1276
01:34:50,215 --> 01:34:51,675
We got to stop him.

1277
01:34:53,379 --> 01:34:54,826
I have an idea.

1278
01:34:57,614 --> 01:34:59,700
- Ready?
- Probably not.

1279
01:35:02,043 --> 01:35:04,935
One, two,
three... now!

1280
01:35:27,864 --> 01:35:29,255
Dad!

1281
01:35:29,419 --> 01:35:30,864
Dad!

1282
01:35:31,341 --> 01:35:32,911
Cassie!

1283
01:35:34,145 --> 01:35:35,200
You're huge!

1284
01:35:35,225 --> 01:35:36,700
I'm huge!

1285
01:35:41,169 --> 01:35:42,700
I love you, Peanut.

1286
01:35:42,700 --> 01:35:44,357
I love you, too.

1287
01:35:44,637 --> 01:35:46,161
I'm so proud of you.

1288
01:35:47,057 --> 01:35:49,057
I feel like I'm hugging Godzilla.

1289
01:35:50,115 --> 01:35:51,763
I know. It feels so cool.

1290
01:35:52,286 --> 01:35:53,818
I know, right?

1291
01:35:54,318 --> 01:35:55,700
I'm so hungry.

1292
01:35:55,725 --> 01:35:56,630
Yeah, that happens.

1293
01:35:56,655 --> 01:35:59,552
- I could eat everything.
- Everything. I know.

1294
01:35:59,629 --> 01:36:01,419
I really want like, a lime.

1295
01:36:01,444 --> 01:36:02,349
Right?

1296
01:36:02,374 --> 01:36:04,630
- Citrus, it's weird. I know.
- Citrus...

1297
01:36:16,216 --> 01:36:17,700
Take the tower!

1298
01:36:49,184 --> 01:36:50,450
It's over.

1299
01:36:52,465 --> 01:36:54,675
You still can't see it.

1300
01:36:56,813 --> 01:36:59,613
It's never over.

1301
01:38:12,934 --> 01:38:15,284
- Fall back!
- Fall back!

1302
01:38:16,075 --> 01:38:18,733
We have to go, right now.

1303
01:38:18,758 --> 01:38:20,589
I know, I know,
but we have to go.

1304
01:39:12,260 --> 01:39:13,515
You son of a...

1305
01:39:23,746 --> 01:39:26,474
You think this is new to me?

1306
01:39:27,630 --> 01:39:32,690
Do you know how many
rebellions I've put down?

1307
01:39:33,900 --> 01:39:35,700
No, no, no, no, no...

1308
01:39:35,700 --> 01:39:40,025
How many worlds
I've conquered?

1309
01:39:40,050 --> 01:39:42,361
How many Avengers I've killed?

1310
01:39:42,630 --> 01:39:45,158
And you think you can beat me?

1311
01:39:45,183 --> 01:39:46,555
I am Kang!

1312
01:39:47,594 --> 01:39:51,107
You, you talk to ants.

1313
01:41:10,700 --> 01:41:18,935
My name is Darren,
and I am not a dick!

1314
01:41:39,802 --> 01:41:41,275
Sorry I'm late.

1315
01:41:43,272 --> 01:41:44,558
Lot of ants.

1316
01:41:45,900 --> 01:41:47,100
Oh, was this you?

1317
01:41:47,762 --> 01:41:51,137
Maybe you were
right about me, Cassie.

1318
01:41:51,393 --> 01:41:52,402
Darren!

1319
01:41:54,578 --> 01:41:55,741
Are you okay?

1320
01:41:58,248 --> 01:41:59,636
Probably not.

1321
01:42:00,805 --> 01:42:01,865
Darren?

1322
01:42:01,890 --> 01:42:05,184
Hi, Hope. You changed your hair.

1323
01:42:07,681 --> 01:42:09,717
What the hell happened?

1324
01:42:10,250 --> 01:42:12,442
Yeah, no, it's...
it's a whole thing.

1325
01:42:12,467 --> 01:42:13,470
I'll tell you later.

1326
01:42:13,930 --> 01:42:16,926
That was... I don't
know what to say.

1327
01:42:17,515 --> 01:42:18,813
Thanks, Scott.

1328
01:42:19,384 --> 01:42:22,829
You always were
a brother to me.

1329
01:42:24,838 --> 01:42:25,974
I was?

1330
01:42:33,620 --> 01:42:34,659
I was.

1331
01:42:48,785 --> 01:42:53,681
And at least I died, an Avenger.

1332
01:42:56,740 --> 01:42:57,785
Yeah.

1333
01:42:59,050 --> 01:43:00,140
- You did.
- Yeah. No, it's...

1334
01:43:00,150 --> 01:43:01,806
You're in.

1335
01:43:18,316 --> 01:43:19,626
A lot has happened today.

1336
01:43:20,700 --> 01:43:21,926
- Henry.
- Janet?

1337
01:43:21,951 --> 01:43:22,980
Mom, where are you?

1338
01:43:23,005 --> 01:43:23,957
I'm in the tower.

1339
01:43:23,982 --> 01:43:26,511
I think I can give
us one shot back.

1340
01:43:26,536 --> 01:43:29,536
But we don't have much time.
If we want to go home,

1341
01:43:32,300 --> 01:43:33,500
we have to go now.

1342
01:43:34,167 --> 01:43:35,427
We'll finish it.

1343
01:43:37,626 --> 01:43:38,707
Thank you.

1344
01:43:39,698 --> 01:43:40,715
Thank you.

1345
01:43:42,731 --> 01:43:44,285
Come on, let's go!

1346
01:43:44,310 --> 01:43:45,670
All right, good luck.

1347
01:43:45,780 --> 01:43:47,090
Good luck. Come on.

1348
01:44:17,824 --> 01:44:18,937
Thanks, buddy.

1349
01:44:21,042 --> 01:44:22,150
You did it.

1350
01:44:25,793 --> 01:44:27,000
Let's go home.

1351
01:44:48,791 --> 01:44:49,891
Where is Scott?

1352
01:44:50,050 --> 01:44:51,603
He was right behind me.

1353
01:45:34,371 --> 01:45:36,125
You should have
looked the other way.

1354
01:45:36,175 --> 01:45:39,050
Yeah, well, never
been great at that.

1355
01:45:46,831 --> 01:45:48,298
And you're not getting out.

1356
01:45:58,761 --> 01:46:00,587
I want you to remember...

1357
01:46:01,813 --> 01:46:03,350
You could've gone home.

1358
01:46:18,384 --> 01:46:20,377
You could've seen
your daughter again.

1359
01:46:34,288 --> 01:46:35,782
But you thought you could win.

1360
01:46:36,748 --> 01:46:38,108
We both just have to lose.

1361
01:47:28,695 --> 01:47:29,906
Dad!

1362
01:47:36,805 --> 01:47:39,250
Oh, where, where is she?

1363
01:47:39,430 --> 01:47:41,060
Where is she?

1364
01:47:41,085 --> 01:47:42,023
She's okay.

1365
01:47:42,048 --> 01:47:43,093
She's okay.

1366
01:47:43,351 --> 01:47:45,200
Scott, she's okay.
They're all okay.

1367
01:47:46,031 --> 01:47:47,250
You did it.

1368
01:47:50,406 --> 01:47:52,328
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry, sorry...
- No, no, no ---

1369
01:47:52,353 --> 01:47:53,789
Don't let go.

1370
01:47:54,476 --> 01:47:55,473
Don't let go.

1371
01:47:55,726 --> 01:47:57,025
Don't ever let go.

1372
01:47:58,574 --> 01:47:59,774
I got you.

1373
01:48:02,889 --> 01:48:04,139
You came back.

1374
01:48:14,490 --> 01:48:15,672
I love you, Hope.

1375
01:48:18,285 --> 01:48:20,381
I love you, Scott.

1376
01:49:33,470 --> 01:49:34,812
Let's go home.

1377
01:49:37,524 --> 01:49:38,758
Home's good.

1378
01:49:47,191 --> 01:49:48,571
My life doesn't make sense.

1379
01:49:49,029 --> 01:49:51,312
I used to ask myself a
lot of questions about that.

1380
01:49:51,613 --> 01:49:54,275
Scott, you just saved the quantum
realm with your family,

1381
01:49:54,300 --> 01:49:56,189
and drank a guy without holes.

1382
01:49:56,375 --> 01:49:58,375
Why does this kind of
stuff keep happening to you?

1383
01:49:58,400 --> 01:50:00,263
That doesn't make any sense.

1384
01:50:00,450 --> 01:50:01,904
Well, you know what?

1385
01:50:02,071 --> 01:50:03,861
Who said life has to make sense?

1386
01:50:08,392 --> 01:50:11,044
- Ruben.
- You are the bug!

1387
01:50:11,412 --> 01:50:12,820
I was wrong, yeah.

1388
01:50:12,854 --> 01:50:14,602
You are the other bug.

1389
01:50:14,662 --> 01:50:15,974
You're the bug-man.

1390
01:50:16,013 --> 01:50:18,653
You get big, and get
small, like a big bug.

1391
01:50:19,193 --> 01:50:20,940
You're right. That's me.

1392
01:50:20,965 --> 01:50:22,190
Just a coffee, please.

1393
01:50:22,271 --> 01:50:23,353
Twelve dollar.

1394
01:50:25,086 --> 01:50:26,113
Twelve!

1395
01:50:26,205 --> 01:50:28,685
I used to wonder if this
chapter in my life was over.

1396
01:50:28,710 --> 01:50:31,852
But as Cassie reminded me, there
is always someone you can help.

1397
01:50:32,652 --> 01:50:35,231
Came out of cake-
making retirement for ya.

1398
01:50:39,654 --> 01:50:40,779
You made this yourself?

1399
01:50:40,804 --> 01:50:42,474
Yeah, I don't usually
make the cakes.

1400
01:50:42,499 --> 01:50:43,264
I know.

1401
01:50:43,289 --> 01:50:45,302
This is the first one
I made since 1997.

1402
01:50:45,327 --> 01:50:46,474
You're a real artist.

1403
01:50:46,865 --> 01:50:48,615
It's been a pretty wild ride.

1404
01:50:48,935 --> 01:50:51,200
One day, you're fired
from Baskin Robbins,

1405
01:50:51,215 --> 01:50:54,380
The next, you're beating
a time-traveling Space King.

1406
01:50:55,104 --> 01:50:57,201
We did beat him, right?

1407
01:50:58,716 --> 01:51:00,333
I mean, yeah, that's what happened.

1408
01:51:00,468 --> 01:51:02,232
He was getting out
and he didn't get out.

1409
01:51:03,704 --> 01:51:04,919
I think.

1410
01:51:06,666 --> 01:51:09,180
But he also said
something bad was coming.

1411
01:51:09,413 --> 01:51:12,063
And that everyone would
die if he didn't get out.

1412
01:51:12,767 --> 01:51:15,267
Wait, so did I just kill everyone?

1413
01:51:15,677 --> 01:51:17,998
Is everyone gonna
die because of me?

1414
01:51:18,092 --> 01:51:19,130
Oh, my God.

1415
01:51:20,114 --> 01:51:21,700
Oh, my... what did I do.

1416
01:51:23,678 --> 01:51:25,120
What did I do?

1417
01:51:28,851 --> 01:51:29,763
You know what?

1418
01:51:29,900 --> 01:51:31,400
It's probably fine.

1419
01:51:31,400 --> 01:51:33,654
Like I said, life doesn't
make any sense.

1420
01:51:33,679 --> 01:51:36,849
So maybe stop asking
so many questions, Scott.

1421
01:51:36,874 --> 01:51:38,708
Stop overthinking it.

1422
01:51:41,085 --> 01:51:42,702
Surprise!

1423
01:51:48,502 --> 01:51:49,550
It's not my birthday.

1424
01:51:49,969 --> 01:51:52,466
I know. But I missed a few.

1425
01:51:54,409 --> 01:51:55,482
This is good.

1426
01:51:55,605 --> 01:51:56,653
We're all together.

1427
01:51:57,089 --> 01:51:58,106
We're fine.

1428
01:51:58,340 --> 01:52:01,482
Everything's... probably fine.

1429
01:52:01,700 --> 01:52:02,956
Kang's gone.

1430
01:52:02,981 --> 01:52:04,091
We did it.

1431
01:52:04,993 --> 01:52:07,243
Don't have to worry
about that guy anymore.

1432
01:52:07,268 --> 01:52:08,268
Nice.

1433
01:52:11,468 --> 01:52:14,099
Happy fake birthday, Cassie.

1434
01:54:51,326 --> 01:54:55,138
So, the exiled one is dead.

1435
01:54:56,997 --> 01:54:59,372
You're sure he's dead?

1436
01:54:59,779 --> 01:55:02,312
If it wasn't true I
wouldn't call you.

1437
01:55:03,419 --> 01:55:06,239
Must really eat you up that
you're not the one who killed him.

1438
01:55:06,817 --> 01:55:09,613
None of us...

1439
01:55:10,091 --> 01:55:12,067
killed him.

1440
01:55:14,131 --> 01:55:15,318
They did.

1441
01:55:16,420 --> 01:55:20,982
They are beginning
to touch the multiverse.

1442
01:55:21,763 --> 01:55:25,208
And if we let them,
they will take...

1443
01:55:26,732 --> 01:55:28,474
everything

1444
01:55:29,408 --> 01:55:31,072
we've built.

1445
01:55:32,205 --> 01:55:35,228
So let's stop wasting time.

1446
01:55:38,626 --> 01:55:39,626
We're late.

1447
01:55:41,704 --> 01:55:44,118
How many did you call?

1448
01:55:44,392 --> 01:55:46,727
All of us.

1449
01:56:22,121 --> 01:56:23,121
