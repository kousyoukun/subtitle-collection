蚁人与黄蜂女：量子狂潮

2
00:02:30,167 --> 00:02:32,167
这是什么地方?
What is this place?

3
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:52,357
我的生活毫无意义 
My life doesn't really make sense.

4
00:02:52,458 --> 00:02:55,544
我曾经问过自己很多关于这方面的问题 
I used to ask myself a lot of questions about that.

5
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:59,716
斯科特 你是个离过婚的前科犯 你怎么会是复仇者?
Scott, you're a divorced ex-con. How are you an Avenger?

6
00:02:59,755 --> 00:03:01,894
你为什么要跟美国队长穿越?
Why are you time-travelling with Captain America?

7
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:03,575
这说不通啊 
That doesn't make sense.

8
00:03:05,013 --> 00:03:06,667
我的生活发生了很大的变化
A lot has changed about my life

9
00:03:06,692 --> 00:03:09,480
但无论我走到哪里 人们都问我同样的问题…
but everywhere I go, people ask me the same thing...

10
00:03:09,505 --> 00:03:11,527
你能和我的狗合个影吗?
Can you take a picture with my dog?

11
00:03:11,552 --> 00:03:16,294
斯科特 现在怎么办?接下来会怎么样?这趟旅程会把你带到哪里?
Scott, what about now? What's next? Where does the ride take you?

12
00:03:16,779 --> 00:03:20,779
说实话我也不知道
If I knew that, it wouldn't be a ride.

13
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:24,488
这几年对每个人来说都很疯狂 
It's been a crazy few years for everyone.

14
00:03:24,844 --> 00:03:26,411
一切都为你准备好了 
Everything is ready for you.

15
00:03:26,482 --> 00:03:29,075
-你太过分了 -不不不不…
- You're too much. - No, no, no, no...

16
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:30,732
你的钱在这里没用 
Your money's no good here.

17
00:03:30,757 --> 00:03:33,116
-我们还在谈这个吗? -是的 当然!
- Are we still talking about that? - Yes, of course!

18
00:03:33,768 --> 00:03:35,768
鲁本 你是最棒的 
Ruben, you are the best.

19
00:03:36,057 --> 00:03:38,181
谢谢你 蜘蛛侠!
Thank you, Spider-Man!

20
00:03:39,924 --> 00:03:43,018
让我们为真正重要的事情腾出时间吧 
So let's make time for the stuff that really matters.

21
00:03:43,043 --> 00:03:45,073
喜欢的朋友 
Like friends.

22
00:03:45,245 --> 00:03:47,674
你甚至都不知道你有朋友 
Friends you didn't even know you had.

23
00:03:48,736 --> 00:03:50,802
记住是谁把你带到了这里 
Remember the people who got you here.

24
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:53,315
没有他们 你不可能来到这
You couldn't have done it without them.

25
00:03:53,365 --> 00:03:56,760
我只是个被巴斯金·罗宾斯解雇的人 
Hey, I'm just a guy who got fired from Baskin Robbins.

26
00:03:57,253 --> 00:03:58,868
有时候你只是运气好 
Sometimes you just get lucky.

27
00:03:58,893 --> 00:04:01,471
我很幸运遇到了霍普·范·戴恩 
I'm lucky I met Hope Van Dyne.

28
00:04:01,496 --> 00:04:03,190
我觉得你知道她是谁 
I think you know who she is.

29
00:04:03,682 --> 00:04:05,837
她拿回了她爸爸的公司 
She's taken back her dad's company.

30
00:04:05,862 --> 00:04:09,346
现在她用皮姆粒子来研究全球变化 
Now she's using the Pym Particle for global change.

31
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,213
很多人说他们想拯救世界 
A lot of people say they want to save the world,

32
00:04:12,238 --> 00:04:14,409
但霍普?她每天都在拯救世界
but Hope? She saves it every day.

33
00:04:14,434 --> 00:04:15,963
谢谢你！

植树造林、经济适用房、粮食生产……
Reforestation, affordable housing, Food production...

36
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:23,995
她一秒钟也不浪费 
She's not wasting a second.

37
00:04:30,909 --> 00:04:32,424
我还是不敢相信 
I still can't believe it.

38
00:04:32,713 --> 00:04:34,713
这一切都不应该发生 
None of this should've happened.

39
00:04:34,925 --> 00:04:36,127
但事实确实如此 
But it did.

40
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:39,338
这是一个很好的世界 
It's a pretty good world.

41
00:04:39,768 --> 00:04:41,575
我很高兴我们拯救它 
I'm glad we saved it.

42
00:04:43,088 --> 00:04:46,362
我错过了什么? 有时 
Do I miss the action? Sometimes.

43
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:50,463
当复仇者需要我的时候我会出现吗? 当然
Will I be there when the Avengers need me? Absolutely.

44
00:04:50,488 --> 00:04:52,600
我绝不会背弃他们 
I'd never turn my back on them.

45
00:04:52,814 --> 00:04:56,635
但现在 我唯一想做的工作就是当爸爸 
But right now, the only job I want is being a dad.

46
00:04:57,463 --> 00:04:59,198
我爱你 凯西 
I love you, Cassie.

47
00:04:59,873 --> 00:05:01,940
谢谢你成为我的英雄 
Thanks for being my hero.

48
00:05:03,002 --> 00:05:05,202
很抱歉我错过了你的几个生日 
And I'm sorry I missed some birthdays.

49
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:11,166
对于剩下的孩子们 给你们一点建议…
And for the rest of you kids out there, word of advice...

50
00:05:11,191 --> 00:05:12,600
注意那个小家伙 
Look out for the little guy.

51
00:05:13,518 --> 00:05:14,979
犯错
Make mistakes.

52

冒险 
Take chances.

53
00:05:17,057 --> 00:05:19,600
如果说生活教会了我什么…
Because if there's one thing life's taught me...

54
00:05:19,794 --> 00:05:23,544
那就是成长
There's always room to grow.

55
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:31,251
对不起 是我 
Sorry, that's me.

56
00:05:32,511 --> 00:05:34,229
为什么监狱打来电话?
Why is jail calling?

57
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,600
朗!朗!
Lang! Lang!

58
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:41,955
-我在这里 -好了 走吧 我们走

Give it back. I know it was you.

65
00:06:04,764 --> 00:06:05,778
你确定吗?
Are you sure?

66
00:06:05,803 --> 00:06:07,925
我是说 很难理解你发射的催泪瓦斯
I mean, it was kind of hard to see through all that tear gas you fired

67
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:10,342
在满是和平抗议者的公园 
into the park full of peaceful protesters.

68
00:06:10,367 --> 00:06:13,592
-在哪里? -对不起 这一定让你很尴尬 
- Where is it? - I'm sorry, this must be really embarrassing for you.

69
00:06:15,412 --> 00:06:18,826
不过我找到了这个 
Oh, I did find this though.

70
00:06:23,825 --> 00:06:26,090
你缩小了一辆警车?你在想什么?
You shrank a cop car? What were you thinking?

71
00:06:26,115 --> 00:06:28,496
那我该怎么办?视而不见?
What was I supposed to do? Look the other way?

72
00:06:28,521 --> 00:06:30,600
他们在半夜清理一个无家可归者的营地 
They were clearing out a homeless camp in the middle of the night.

73
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,503
-不 我不是说… -他们希望去哪里?
- No, I'm not saying... - Where do they expect them to go?

74
00:06:32,528 --> 00:06:34,675
他们在波利普失去了家园 这不是他们的错 
It's not their fault that they lost their homes in the Blip.

75
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:35,527
我知道 
I know that.

76
00:06:35,551 --> 00:06:38,559
现在没人付得起房租 除非你是个信托基金的混蛋 
No one can even afford rent right now unless you're some trust fund asshole.

77
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,403
我不是在告诉你该怎么做 我只是说
I'm not telling you what to do. I'm just saying ---

78
00:06:40,428 --> 00:06:42,684
-告诉她该怎么做 -告诉我该怎么做 
- Telling her what to do. - Telling me exactly what to do.

79
00:06:42,824 --> 00:06:46,481
不 你想怎么做就怎么做… 我只是在提建议
No, you do what you want... I'm suggesting another way to do it.

80
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,600
好的 
Okay.

81
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:49,520
我向你妈妈保证过 使用这东西
You know, I promised your mom that you would only use this stuff

82
00:06:49,545 --> 00:06:51,545
只会在我们一个人在的时候
when one of us was around.

83
00:06:51,637 --> 00:06:52,917
这非常危险
It's really dangerous tech.

84
00:06:52,942 --> 00:06:54,442
我知道 这很危险
I know. It's dangerous.

85
00:06:54,481 --> 00:06:56,863
要是被警察带走了呢? 如果你把它弄丢了怎么办?
What if the cops took it from you? Huh? What if you lost it?

86
00:06:56,888 --> 00:06:58,264
我没有弄丢衣服 
I didn't lose the suit.

87
00:06:58,318 --> 00:07:00,176
你有一套西装…等等 你有西装吗?
You have a suit... wait. You have a suit?

88
00:07:00,201 --> 00:07:04,026
我知道怎么照顾自己 好吗? 相信我 我现在已经很擅长了 
I know how to take care of myself, okay? Trust me. I'm pretty good at it by now.

89
00:07:04,857 --> 00:07:05,857
哎哟 
Ouch.

90
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:10,528
-听着 我不是那个意思 我很抱歉 -我知道 没关系 
- Look, I didn't mean it like that. I'm sorry. - I know. That's okay.

91
00:07:10,553 --> 00:07:12,553
好的 我明白了 
It's alright. I get it.

92
00:07:12,824 --> 00:07:15,625
我只是觉得你应该过正常的生活 
I just think you should get to have a normal life.

93
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:20,012
爸爸 我六岁的时候有个打扮成蜜蜂的家伙想在我房间里杀了我 
Dad, a guy dressed like a bee tried to kill me in my room when I was six.

94
00:07:20,365 --> 00:07:22,365
我从来没有过正常的生活 
I've never had a normal life.

95
00:07:23,729 --> 00:07:25,129
来点音乐怎么样?
How about some music?

96
00:07:25,496 --> 00:07:29,785
那一刻 我满脑子想的都是 绿巨人是怎么把我变成婴儿的?
And in that moment, all I could think, was how did the Hulk turn me into a baby?

97
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:31,924
我会永远是个婴儿吗?
Will I be a baby forever?

98
00:07:31,949 --> 00:07:33,600
我是绿巨人的孩子吗?
Am I the Hulk's baby?

99
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,520
爸爸 你有在听吗?
Dad, are you listening to your own book?

100
00:07:35,545 --> 00:07:36,831
-我已经准备好了 -嗯?
- But I was ready for anything. - Hmm?

101
00:07:36,856 --> 00:07:39,371
-不 那是…这是收音机 -…史蒂夫和我……
- No, that's... this is the radio. - ...Steve and I...

102
00:07:39,396 --> 00:07:40,613
爸爸 把它关了 
Dad, turn it off.

103
00:07:40,638 --> 00:07:43,012
太奇怪了 这个开关有问题 它关不掉 
It's so weird. Something's wrong with this switch. It won't turn off.

104
00:07:43,037 --> 00:07:44,575
我说了把它关掉 
I said turn it off.

105
00:07:44,608 --> 00:07:45,964
那是什么?开大点?好吧 
What's that? Turn it up? Alright.

106
00:07:45,988 --> 00:07:48,457
过了一会儿 一只来自太空的浣熊出现了 
A little after that, a raccoon from space showed up.

107
00:07:48,497 --> 00:07:50,432
我觉得他不知道我的名字 
I don't think he knew my name.

108
00:07:50,457 --> 00:07:53,262
我只是很高兴能遇到一只会说话的浣熊 
I was just happy to meet a raccoon who could talk.

109

110
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:01,418

你的诺贝尔奖已经在邮箱里了

我错过了这个 
I missed this.

量子领域没有披萨?
No pizza in the quantum realm?

00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:18,600
不 没有任何东西 
No. No anything.

117
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,600
妈妈 你可以谈谈这事 如果你愿意的话 
You know, mom, you can talk about it. If you want.

118
00:08:22,937 --> 00:08:26,512
亲爱的 我在那蹲了三十年 
Sweetheart, I spent thirty years down there.

119

我想活在当下 
I want to live right now.

120
00:08:30,416 --> 00:08:31,738

So Cassie, did you make any new friends in the slammer this time?

122

爷爷……
Grandpa...

123
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:41,370
这一次吗?还有最后一次吗?
This time? Was there a last time?

124
00:08:41,395 --> 00:08:43,600
我是说 上次不算什么 
I mean, last time barely counts.

125
00:08:44,442 --> 00:08:46,528
我不知道 你为什么不打电话给我?
I didn't know that. Why didn't you call me?

126
00:08:46,553 --> 00:08:48,106
因为我知道你会这样 
Because I knew you'd be like this.

127
00:08:48,184 --> 00:08:49,971
我会用蚂蚁把你救出来 
I would've just broken you out with ants.

128

00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,775
这不正是我们在做的吗?
Isn't that what we're doing?

131
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:58,113
是的 我是说 关于这个 大家都不介意这事 
Yeah. I mean, about this. About everybody being so fine with this.

听着 你想帮忙 我明白了 我知道 凯西 真的 
Look, you want to help. I get it. I do, Cassie. I really do.

136
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:13,363

138
00:09:15,413 --> 00:09:17,926
-你觉得怎么样 斯科特? -你应该为此写本书

Sign books?

142
00:09:27,576 --> 00:09:29,576
你不是那个闯进Vista公司的人吗?
Aren't you the guy who broke into Vista Corp?

143

Aren't you the guy who flew all the way to Germany just to fight Captain America at the airport?

144
00:09:33,292 --> 00:09:36,092
在机场和美国队长战斗 
Fight with Captain America at the airport.

145
00:09:36,456 --> 00:09:39,793
我不会和美国队长打 我没疯 
I wouldn't fight Captain America. I'm not insane.

146
00:09:40,206 --> 00:09:42,506
人们仍然需要帮助 爸爸 
People still need help, Dad.

147
00:09:42,822 --> 00:09:45,522
至少我们在做有意义的事 
At least we're trying to do something that matters.

148
00:09:49,013 --> 00:09:50,342
“我们”是谁?
Who's "we"?

149
00:09:51,822 --> 00:09:53,482
你们三个在干什么?
What are you three up to?

150
00:09:54,437 --> 00:09:55,974
科学 
Science.

151
00:09:57,226 --> 00:09:58,795
与蚂蚁 
With ants.

152
00:09:59,521 --> 00:10:01,060
蚂蚁的科学 
Ant science.

153
00:10:02,156 --> 00:10:03,959
我不相信你 
I don't believe you.

154
00:10:05,374 --> 00:10:06,928
让我们给他看 
Let's just show him.

155
00:10:10,584 --> 00:10:12,279
哇 他们在造什么?
Woah, what are they building?

156
00:10:12,304 --> 00:10:13,304
你在这么做吗?
Are you doing this?

157
00:10:13,329 --> 00:10:16,329
实际上没有 他们建立了自己的技术 
Actually no. They built their own tech.

158
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,430
非常聪明的蚂蚁 
Pretty smart ants.

159
00:10:18,455 --> 00:10:23,455
好吧 你们离开的那5年 我有很多时间 
Okay, so when you were all like, gone those 5 years, I had a lot of time.

160
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,098
我开始读汉克爷爷的旧日记 
And I started reading Grandpa Hank's old journals.

161
00:10:26,123 --> 00:10:28,560
我真的进入了量子领域 然后…
And I got really into the quantum realm, and...

162
00:10:28,916 --> 00:10:30,366
量子领域?
The quantum realm?

163
00:10:30,506 --> 00:10:33,053
我知道我们都有过去 我不想吓到任何人 
I know we all have a history there, and I didn't want to freak anyone out,

164
00:10:33,078 --> 00:10:34,500
但我们一直在讨论这个问题 
but we were talking about it.

165
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:38,701
她有一些问题 好吗?如果人们受到我的影响 我也无能为力 
She had some questions, okay? I can't help if people are inspired by me.

166
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:44,391
所以你一直在研究量子领域?
So you've been studying the quantum realm?

167
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:47,500
你为什么不问问我?
Why didn't you ask me about it?

168
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:49,607
我试过了 妈妈 
I tried, Mom.

169
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:52,840
很多想法 你从来都不想谈 
A lot. You never wanted to talk about it.

170
00:10:52,865 --> 00:10:56,330
凯西只是很好奇 我们给了她一些建议 
Cassie's just been curious, and we gave her some pointers.

171
00:10:56,355 --> 00:11:00,305
这不是蚂蚁科学 对吧 亨利?
This isn't exactly ant science, is it, Henry?

172
00:11:00,713 --> 00:11:02,794
你知道量子领域有多危险 
You know how dangerous the quantum realm is.

173
00:11:03,283 --> 00:11:05,826
我们都知道 妈妈 没人会去量子领域 
We all do, mom. Nobody's going to the quantum realm.

174
00:11:05,851 --> 00:11:07,795
这就是我们做这个的原因 
That's why we made this.

175
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:11,500
它就像太空或海洋的卫星 
It's like a satellite for deep space or the ocean.

176
00:11:12,279 --> 00:11:13,357
但是…
But...

177
00:11:14,311 --> 00:11:15,724
 量子 
... Quantum.

178
00:11:17,946 --> 00:11:19,421
我们只需要一张地图 
We just need a map.

179
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:22,709
就可以研究和探索整个量子领域 
And then we can study and explore the entire quantum realm.

180
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:25,500
我们甚至不用进入其中
We'd never even have to go.

181
00:11:25,721 --> 00:11:30,421
你女儿在地下室造了个亚原子哈勃望远镜 
Your daughter built a subatomic Hubble telescope in a basement.

182
00:11:33,562 --> 00:11:36,717
你知道吗 如果你不在的时候我有这样的东西 那么…
You know, if I had something like this when you were gone, then...

183
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:40,637
我本可以找到你的 
I could've found you.

184
00:11:43,837 --> 00:11:45,215
真惊人
It's amazing.

185
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:47,390
我惊呆了 
I'm blown away.

186
00:11:49,427 --> 00:11:50,675
它是如何工作的?
How does it work?

187
00:11:51,059 --> 00:11:54,020
有点像我们以前的双向对讲机?
It's kinda like that two-way radio we used to have?

188
00:11:54,333 --> 00:11:58,069
你从这里发送一个信号 然后它收集数据 然后发回 
You send a signal down from here and then it collects the data and it sends it back.

189
00:11:58,094 --> 00:11:59,317
等等 等一下 
Wait, wait a minute.

190
00:11:59,567 --> 00:12:03,500
你在发出信号?深入到量子领域?
You're sending a signal? Down to the quantum realm?

191
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:05,941
是的 
Yeah.

192
00:12:05,966 --> 00:12:08,325
马上把它关掉 
Shut it down, now.

193
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:09,644
-珍妮特… -我们为什么要关闭它…
- Janet... - Why would we shut it...

194
00:12:09,669 --> 00:12:10,500
怎么了?
What's wrong?

195
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:11,500
你得把它关掉!
You have to turn it off!

196
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,500
你得告诉我们怎么了 
You got to tell us what's wrong.

197
00:12:16,661 --> 00:12:17,880
珍妮特 
Janet.

198
00:12:22,153 --> 00:12:24,453
有些事我应该告诉你的 
There is something I should have told you.

199
00:12:58,378 --> 00:12:59,729
爸爸!
Dad!

200
00:13:01,789 --> 00:13:02,823
不!
No!

201
00:13:03,122 --> 00:13:04,495

203
00:13:43,825 --> 00:13:44,898
爸爸!
Dad!

204
00:14:16,861 --> 00:14:17,869
卡西?
Cassie?

205
00:14:23,247 --> 00:14:24,533
爸爸!
Dad!

206
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:26,439
爸爸 来吧 
Dad, come on.

207
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:29,500
你还好吗?
Are you okay?

208
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:30,759
是的 我很好 
Yeah, I'm okay.

209
00:14:46,148 --> 00:14:48,148
我们在哪里?
Where are we?

210
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:07,670
妈妈!
Mom!

211
00:15:08,946 --> 00:15:09,951
爸爸!
Dad!

212
00:15:10,248 --> 00:15:12,125
霍普 这边 
Hope, over here.

213
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:15,631
你还好吗?
Are you okay?

214
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:18,500
我们早该死了 
We should be dead.

215
00:15:18,843 --> 00:15:20,005
我们在哪里?
Where are we?

216
00:15:20,148 --> 00:15:21,373
我不知道 
I don't know.

217
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:25,390
我们是在我想去的地方吗?
Are we where I think we are?

218
00:15:25,713 --> 00:15:27,701
我想说是的 但是…
I would say yes, but...

219
00:15:28,678 --> 00:15:31,069
事情不是这样的 珍妮特!
It wasn't like this. Janet!

220
00:15:31,881 --> 00:15:32,889
妈妈!
Mom!

221
00:15:33,664 --> 00:15:34,928
珍妮特!
Janet!

222
00:15:35,975 --> 00:15:37,108
妈妈!
Mom!

223
00:15:49,304 --> 00:15:51,304
别动 
Do not move.

224
00:16:10,101 --> 00:16:11,812
我们得找到斯科特和凯西 
We need to find Scott and Cassie.

225
00:16:12,687 --> 00:16:13,687
现在 
Right now.

226
00:16:17,328 --> 00:16:18,500
霍普?
Hope?

227
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:19,500
霍普……
Hope...

228
00:16:19,851 --> 00:16:22,312
汉克 能听到我说话吗?
Hank, can you hear me?

229
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:24,500
有人能听到我吗?
Can anyone hear me?

230
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:25,500
我的天啊 
Oh, my God.

231
00:16:26,812 --> 00:16:28,180
-没关系 -我们该怎么办?
- It's okay. - What are we gonna do?

232
00:16:28,205 --> 00:16:29,367
没关系 没关系 
It's okay. It's okay.

233
00:16:29,392 --> 00:16:30,664
我们好了 我们好了 
We're okay. We're okay.

234
00:16:30,689 --> 00:16:32,367
-会没事的 -你说得太多了 
- It's gonna be okay. - You're saying okay too much.

235
00:16:32,392 --> 00:16:33,513
好吧 好吧 好的 
Okay, alright. Okay.

236
00:16:33,538 --> 00:16:34,625
我们就是这样 
Well, it's 'cause we are.

237
00:16:34,650 --> 00:16:35,945
我们没事 
We are okay.

238
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:37,203
我们没事 好吗?
We are fine, okay?

239
00:16:37,228 --> 00:16:39,640
我们会找到他们 然后回家
We're gonna find them, and we're gonna go home

240
00:16:40,476 --> 00:16:41,725
我的意思是看看周围 
I mean take a look around.

241
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:43,203
它真美丽
It's beautiful.

242
00:16:43,228 --> 00:16:45,228
好吧?我们在外面 
All right? We're outside.

243
00:16:45,253 --> 00:16:46,406
就像我们在露营一样 
It's like we're camping.

244
00:16:46,431 --> 00:16:47,431
我们喜欢露营 
We love camping.

245
00:16:47,456 --> 00:16:49,356
我们从来没有露营过 
We've never been camping.

246
00:16:50,145 --> 00:16:51,968
但我们一直在讨论这个问题 
But we've always talked about it.

247
00:16:56,234 --> 00:16:58,234
太阳在动吗?
Is that sun moving?

248
00:17:08,801 --> 00:17:10,247
回来!
Get back!

249
00:17:15,672 --> 00:17:17,672
我觉得这不是太阳 
I don't think this is the sun.

250
00:17:19,126 --> 00:17:20,298
它很好 
It's fine.

251
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:22,500
-爸爸! -没事的!
- Dad! - It's okay!

252
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,500
还好吧 
Still okay.

253
00:17:32,261 --> 00:17:33,849
爸爸!哦 天哪!
Dad! Oh, my God!

254
00:17:33,874 --> 00:17:35,874
这很奇怪 
That was weird.

255
00:17:40,273 --> 00:17:41,368
走
Run.

256
00:18:09,376 --> 00:18:13,251
量子领域里有量子人吗?
There's quantum people in the quantum realm?

257
00:18:13,437 --> 00:18:14,437
是的…
Yeah...

258
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:16,688
我也不知道 
I didn't know that either.

259
00:18:20,952 --> 00:18:22,254
刚才是什么声音 妈妈?
What was that back there, mom?

260
00:18:22,279 --> 00:18:24,066
那艘船在找什么?
What was that ship looking for?

261
00:18:24,091 --> 00:18:25,703
小声点 
Keep your voice down.

262
00:18:25,871 --> 00:18:28,020
你说过这里什么都没有 
You said there was nothing down here.

263
00:18:28,045 --> 00:18:30,475
-你为什么不告诉我们这些? -希望我能解释清楚 
- Why didn't you tell us about all of this? - Hope I will explain everything,

264
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,098
但现在 我只需要你相信我 
but right now, I just need you to trust me.

265
00:18:32,123 --> 00:18:33,123
那就让我相信你 
Then make me trust you.

266
00:18:33,148 --> 00:18:34,855
我们冷静一下 好吗?
Let's just calm down, all right?

267
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:35,948
我们可以谈论……
We can talk about...

268
00:18:35,973 --> 00:18:38,074
我们没时间谈了 亨利 
We don't have time to talk, Henry.

269
00:18:38,099 --> 00:18:39,201
不 你得告诉我们…
No, you need to tell us what...

270
00:18:39,226 --> 00:18:40,355
你为什么不听呢?
And why didn't you listen?

271
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:42,380
我告诉过你离这里远点 
I told you to stay away from here.

272
00:18:42,869 --> 00:18:45,469
珍妮特 我很抱歉 
Janet, I'm so sorry.

273
00:18:45,801 --> 00:18:47,487
我应该告诉你我们在做什么 
I should have told you what we were doing.

274
00:18:47,512 --> 00:18:48,651
我完全不知道……
I had no idea...

275
00:18:48,676 --> 00:18:50,059
我知道 这是……
I know. It's...

276
00:18:50,793 --> 00:18:52,168
我们以后再谈 
We'll talk later.

277
00:18:52,193 --> 00:18:54,193
现在 我们团结在一起
Right now, we stick together,

278
00:18:54,729 --> 00:18:56,429
我们找到了Scott和Cassie…
we find Scott and Cassie...

279
00:18:57,039 --> 00:18:58,691
然后我们回家 好吗?
And we go home, okay?

280
00:18:58,952 --> 00:19:00,952
-好吗? -好的 
- Okay? - Okay.

281
00:19:01,234 --> 00:19:02,379
好的 跟紧点 
Okay, stay close.

282
00:19:09,666 --> 00:19:11,472
这太不可思议了 
This is incredible.

283
00:19:11,918 --> 00:19:14,500
我研究量子领域很多年了 
I studied the quantum realm for years.

284
00:19:16,403 --> 00:19:18,184
为什么我什么都没看到?
Why didn't I see any of this?

285
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,320
你看得不够深入 
You weren't able to look deep enough.

286
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:23,058
不是只通过虚空和亚原子研究
Not through the Void and Subatomica.

287
00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:25,864
这里有很多世界 
There are worlds here.

288
00:19:26,098 --> 00:19:27,809
世界与世界 
Worlds with worlds.

289
00:19:28,854 --> 00:19:32,559
那是一个时间之外的地方……空间 
It's a place outside time and... space.

290
00:19:34,355 --> 00:19:35,934
这是一个神秘的宇宙……
It's a secret universe...

291
00:19:36,882 --> 00:19:38,262
在我们的之外的
beneath ours.

292
00:19:59,999 --> 00:20:01,566
把你的手拿开!
Get your hands off me!

293
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:09,500
卡西?
Cassie?

294
00:20:12,327 --> 00:20:13,711
我女儿在哪里?
Where is my daughter?

295
00:20:15,328 --> 00:20:17,000
她在哪里?
Where is she?

296
00:20:17,499 --> 00:20:18,906
卡西?
Cassie?

297
00:20:22,499 --> 00:20:23,758
我女儿在哪里?
Where is my daughter?

298
00:20:27,256 --> 00:20:28,367
卡西!
Cassie!

299
00:20:30,765 --> 00:20:31,765
爸爸!
Dad!

300
00:20:32,609 --> 00:20:34,008

我们应该折磨他们 
We should torture them.

373
00:25:37,715 --> 00:25:39,231
你为什么总想折磨别人?

我们还有其他选择

375
00:25:40,342 --> 00:25:43,004
你的洞里出来什么东西吗?比如牛奶、果汁……
Do things come out of your holes? Like milk, juice...

376
00:25:43,029 --> 00:25:45,207
维布 别再问他洞的事了 
Veb, stop asking him about his hole,

377
00:25:45,232 --> 00:25:46,776
有些人身上有洞

-这是地球 但是它非常小……-还是同一个宇宙 但更大了…
- Well, this is Earth. But it's very smaller... - It's the same universe, but it's bigger...

384
00:25:57,645 --> 00:25:59,121
-我变大 我缩小…-是的 是的

This is the quantum realm, you have to shrink to enter the quantum realm.

So we shrunk. And right now we're really small. So we're smaller now.

这改变了我们对生命的认知

我拼了命才拿到的

蚂蚁到底是什么?我们这里有吗?

441
00:31:54,353 --> 00:31:58,437
真奇怪 她从来没提过你

我想我也不会告诉我的孩子

我不知道发生了什么

460

我们只是想找到我们的家人

461
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:51,679
你有地图吗?

那栋楼还在吗?
Is that building alive?

你的孩子死了?

467

这里发生了什么?
What happened here?

471
00:33:25,950 --> 00:33:28,687
征服者烧毁了我们的家园

472
00:33:29,242 --> 00:33:30,781
我们的回忆
Our stories.

473
00:33:31,953 --> 00:33:34,937
他把城堡建在我们人民的尸骨上

474
00:33:36,116 --> 00:33:38,366
我们中的一些人逃了出来

发现其他人在逃跑

476
00:33:40,812 --> 00:33:42,616
我们召集了所有能战斗的人

477
00:33:43,084 --> 00:33:44,687
这永远都还不够

我要做的就是送你回家 
What I need to do is get you home.

484
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:01,789
你为什么不想帮忙?
Why don't you want to help?

485
00:34:02,027 --> 00:34:03,336
我们对这地方一无所知 
We don't know anything about this place.

486
00:34:03,361 --> 00:34:05,109
我是说 在这里时间都不知道怎么算 
I mean, not even how time works down here.

487
00:34:05,142 --> 00:34:07,695
我们是消失了10秒钟 还是消失了10年?
Have we been gone for 10 seconds, or have we been out for 10 years?

488
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:09,709
现在想想你妈妈 你能想象吗?
Think about your mom right now. Can you imagine?

489
00:34:09,734 --> 00:34:11,500
别拿妈妈当借口 
Don't use mom as an excuse.

490
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:13,500
-你就是不在乎 -不 我在乎 
- You just don't care. - No, I do care.

491
00:34:13,629 --> 00:34:15,429
我知道你想帮忙 我知道
I know you want to help. I do.

492
00:34:15,704 --> 00:34:17,257
但这不是我们的战斗 
But this is not our fight.

493
00:34:17,282 --> 00:34:19,031
就因为这事没发生在你身上 
Just because it's not happening to you,

494
00:34:19,056 --> 00:34:21,056
不代表它没有发生 
doesn't mean it's not happening.

495

除非你想改变自己的生活

00:43:36,051 --> 00:43:37,503
看 动量 对吧?
Look, momentum, right?

611
00:43:37,528 --> 00:43:39,700
跳 拍 对吗?一个动作 跳 拍 
Jump, tap, right? One move, jump, tap.

612
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:40,809
我知道怎么做 爸爸 
I know how to do it, dad.

613
00:43:40,834 --> 00:43:42,184
-是吗?真的吗?——是的!
- Oh, do you? Really? - Yes!

614
00:43:42,209 --> 00:43:44,800
-因为从我这边看不像-我搞错了时间 
- 'Cause it didn't look like it from my end. - I messed up on the timing.

615
00:43:44,825 --> 00:43:46,300
跳……
Jump...

616
00:43:51,308 --> 00:43:52,363
像这样 
Like that.

617
00:43:52,388 --> 00:43:54,050
你看到我做了什么吗?你看到我做了什么吗?
You see what I did? You see what I did?

618
00:43:54,215 --> 00:43:56,417
不 你就这么小!
No, you were like this small!

619
00:43:56,442 --> 00:43:57,964
我又跳又拍 
I jumped and tapped.

620
00:44:08,019 --> 00:44:10,183
詹托拉 我们得走了 
Jentorra, we have to go.

621
00:44:30,864 --> 00:44:32,317
快上船!
Get to the ship!

622
00:45:19,817 --> 00:45:22,386
欢迎回到量子领域 斯科特 
Welcome back to the quantum realm, Scott.

623
00:45:23,236 --> 00:45:25,667
我等这一刻已经很久了 
I've been waiting a long time for this.

624
00:45:26,582 --> 00:45:27,777
什么?
What?

625
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:30,700
有人在里面吗?
Is someone in there?

626
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:32,238
哦,是的 
Oh, yes.

627
00:45:32,543 --> 00:45:35,347
一个你无法逃避的命运 
A destiny you cannot escape.

628
00:45:35,676 --> 00:45:38,503
我们的命运一直是紧密相连的 
Our fates have always been forged together.

629
00:45:40,816 --> 00:45:42,816
自从我们相遇的那天起 
Ever since that day we met.

630
00:45:45,027 --> 00:45:46,700
斯科特·朗 
Scott Lang.

631
00:45:46,700 --> 00:45:47,700
离我们远点!
Get away from us!

632
00:45:47,700 --> 00:45:50,137
然后你把我击垮了 
And then you broke me.

633
00:45:52,700 --> 00:45:55,700
-把我放逐到这里-等待…
- Banished me down here. - Wait...

634
00:45:56,950 --> 00:45:58,238
达伦?
Darren?

635
00:45:59,574 --> 00:46:01,354
看到我很惊讶?
Surprised to see me?

636
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,167
是的 
Yeah.

637
00:46:04,417 --> 00:46:05,700
是那个蜜蜂男 
It's that bee guy.

638
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:06,700
是那个蜜蜂男 
It's the bee guy.

639
00:46:06,864 --> 00:46:07,864
卡西?
Cassie?

640
00:46:08,050 --> 00:46:09,700
我差点没认出你来 
I almost didn't recognize you.

641
00:46:09,966 --> 00:46:11,966
你怎么没死?
How are you not dead?

642
00:46:12,179 --> 00:46:14,629
我成了终极武器 
I became the ultimate weapon.

643
00:46:15,350 --> 00:46:17,700
这是什么?
That's what this is?

644
00:46:18,386 --> 00:46:19,700
看,达伦……
Look, Darren...

645
00:46:23,775 --> 00:46:25,517
达伦死了!
Darren is dead!

646
00:46:25,876 --> 00:46:27,548
只有……
There is only...

647
00:46:27,573 --> 00:46:29,087
M.O.D.O.K !
M.O.D.O.K!

648
00:46:29,743 --> 00:46:32,015
你无处可逃 斯科特 
And there's no place you can run, Scott.

649
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:33,700
不是我 
Not from me,

650
00:46:33,700 --> 00:46:35,700
而且不是从他那里 
and not from him.

651
00:46:36,492 --> 00:46:38,470
他是未来 
He is the future.

652
00:46:39,212 --> 00:46:40,735
他是最棒的 
He's the best.

653
00:46:41,087 --> 00:46:44,887
现在他只需要你了 
And now all he needs is you.

654
00:46:50,824 --> 00:46:53,962
妈妈 斯科特和凯西之后是什么?
Mom, what's after Scott and Cassie?

655
00:46:55,937 --> 00:46:57,637
我们必须找到他们 
We have to find them.

656
00:46:58,550 --> 00:47:00,384
我得先做点事 
There's something I have to do first.

657
00:47:00,409 --> 00:47:01,700
他可能已经死了 
He could be dead.

658
00:47:02,027 --> 00:47:03,502
希望,请 
Hope, please.

659
00:47:03,551 --> 00:47:05,017
你还对我们有所隐瞒 
And you're still hiding things from us.

660
00:47:05,042 --> 00:47:07,587
我是在保护你 
I am trying to protect you.

661
00:47:08,230 --> 00:47:09,517
从什么?
From what?

662
00:47:12,050 --> 00:47:13,700
你到底在怕谁?
Who are you so afraid of?

663
00:47:26,267 --> 00:47:27,900
第三次入狱 
Third time in jail.

664
00:47:29,900 --> 00:47:31,142
四 
Four.

665
00:47:39,548 --> 00:47:42,051
现在我们又来了 
And here we are again.

666
00:47:42,792 --> 00:47:44,251
面对面 
Face to face.

667
00:47:46,732 --> 00:47:48,582
这是一张脸 这是,呃…
That's a face. That's, uh...

668
00:47:49,634 --> 00:47:50,786
那是一张大脸 
That's a big face.

669
00:47:50,910 --> 00:47:52,660
为什么你只是个飘浮的脑袋?
Why are you just a floating head?

670
00:47:52,941 --> 00:47:54,984
也许你能帮我们搞定 达伦 
Maybe you can walk us through this, Darren.

671
00:47:55,050 --> 00:47:58,017
你让达伦死在量子领域 
You left Darren to die in the quantum realm.

672
00:47:59,700 --> 00:48:01,275
但是征服者找到了我 
But the Conqueror found me.

673
00:48:02,001 --> 00:48:03,462
我重建 
Rebuilt me.

674
00:48:03,551 --> 00:48:05,551
让我成为终极武器 
Made me the ultimate weapon.

675
00:48:06,025 --> 00:48:09,259
一种专为杀戮而设计的机械化生物 
A mechanized organism designed only for killing.

676
00:48:09,275 --> 00:48:10,642
哦,M.O.D.O.K !
Oh, M.O.D.O.K!

677
00:48:11,312 --> 00:48:14,157
哦 一个……哦 我明白了 这是首字母缩写 
Oh, a mo... Oh, I get it. It's an acronym.

678
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:16,134
这是首字母缩写 
It's an acronym.

679
00:48:16,184 --> 00:48:19,189
专为杀戮而设计的机械化生物 
Mechanized Organism Designed Only for Killing.

680
00:48:20,614 --> 00:48:22,301
实际上 那是MODOFK 
Actually, that's MODOFK.

681
00:48:22,326 --> 00:48:23,949
我打赌你以为再也见不到我了 
I bet you thought you'd seen the last of me.

682
00:48:23,974 --> 00:48:26,332
刚才注意到宝宝的腿 
Just now noticing the baby legs.

683
00:48:26,637 --> 00:48:28,637
-这不是婴儿腿 -有点像小浴盆 
- They're not baby legs. - Little bit like a bjorn.

684
00:48:28,662 --> 00:48:30,462
你以为你很聪明 
You think you're so smart.

685
00:48:30,864 --> 00:48:32,183
斯科特·朗 
Scott Lang.

686
00:48:32,208 --> 00:48:33,888
那个夺走我一切的人 
The man who took everything from me.

687
00:48:33,950 --> 00:48:35,489
偷了我一生的人 
Who stole my whole life.

688
00:48:35,725 --> 00:48:37,036
但我做到了 
But I did it.

689
00:48:38,250 --> 00:48:39,700
我找到你了 
I got you here.

690
00:48:40,025 --> 00:48:41,700
我找到你的信号了 凯西 
I found your signal, Cassie.

691
00:48:42,293 --> 00:48:43,401
顺便说一句 谢谢你 
Thanks for that, by the way.

692
00:48:43,426 --> 00:48:44,638
没有你我做不到 
Couldn't have done it without you.

693
00:48:47,903 --> 00:48:50,184
你现在看到的是一个重获自由的人 
You're looking at a man set free.

694
00:48:50,951 --> 00:48:55,270
我在这里创造的东西比你想象的要多得多 
I've created so much more here than you could possibly imagine.

695
00:48:55,737 --> 00:48:58,293
都是为了他 
All for him.

696
00:49:01,118 --> 00:49:04,052
我不是唯一一个被困在量子领域的人 
I wasn't the only one stranded in the quantum realm.

697
00:49:07,645 --> 00:49:09,340
这是什么地方?
What is this place?

698
00:49:10,698 --> 00:49:12,669
他说他是个旅行者 
He said he was a traveler.

699
00:49:12,802 --> 00:49:15,958
一位科学家偏离了航线 
A scientist who crashed off-course.

700
00:49:23,263 --> 00:49:28,286
他有一艘我从未见过的船 
He had a ship beyond anything I had ever seen.

701
00:49:29,027 --> 00:49:31,832
一艘可以穿越多元宇宙的飞船 
A ship that could travel the multiverse.

702
00:49:32,248 --> 00:49:33,598
多元宇宙吗?
The multiverse?

703
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:38,700
在交替维度 平行现实中?
As in alternate dimensions, parallel realities?

704
00:49:39,106 --> 00:49:41,099
一开始我不相信 
I didn't believe it at first.

705
00:49:43,161 --> 00:49:44,700
但这是真的 
But it's real.

706
00:49:45,481 --> 00:49:47,684
就像我们的理论 
Just like we theorized.

707
00:49:49,519 --> 00:49:51,591
这能带我们回家吗?
Can this take us home?

708
00:49:53,394 --> 00:49:55,099
它可以带你去任何地方 
It can take you anywhere.

709
00:50:13,938 --> 00:50:16,430
我从未见过像他这样的人 
I've never met anyone like him.

710
00:50:18,220 --> 00:50:21,635
他感到很失落 
He felt so lost.

711
00:50:23,450 --> 00:50:25,181
我想我们都是 
I guess we both were.

712
00:50:25,775 --> 00:50:27,510
但我们有办法 
But we had a way out.

713
00:50:29,408 --> 00:50:34,900
我们用尽一切办法给他飞船的能量核心充电 
We tried everything to recharge his ship's energy core.

714
00:50:40,090 --> 00:50:41,408
毫无效果 
Nothing worked.

715
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:48,150
但孤独了这么多年 有个朋友真好 
But after so many years alone, it was nice to have a friend.

716
00:50:49,076 --> 00:50:51,009
我骗了喜旺 
I lied to Hope.

717
00:50:55,100 --> 00:50:57,135
我告诉她我要回家了 
I told her I was coming home.

718
00:51:00,875 --> 00:51:03,189
我能在门边看到她
I can see her by the door

719
00:51:05,213 --> 00:51:06,766
在等我 
waiting for me.

720
00:51:10,796 --> 00:51:12,689
那是我做的最后一件事 
That's the last thing I did.

721
00:51:14,862 --> 00:51:16,236
那是对她的谎言 
It was lie to her.

722
00:51:19,814 --> 00:51:22,064
我以为我有更多的时间 
I just thought I'd had more time.

723
00:51:26,848 --> 00:51:28,369
我可以给你 
I can give that to you.

724
00:51:30,077 --> 00:51:31,166
时间 
Time.

725
00:51:35,114 --> 00:51:36,791
不是你想的那样 
It's not what you think it is.

726
00:51:40,713 --> 00:51:41,978
这是一个笼子 
It's a cage.

727
00:51:43,489 --> 00:51:47,353
它会想尽一切办法击垮你 
It does everything it can to break you.

728
00:51:50,277 --> 00:51:53,720
直到你从中解脱出来 你才会看到……
It's not until you free yourself from it that you see...

729
00:51:54,671 --> 00:51:58,439
它总是那么小 
Just how small it always was.

730
00:52:04,157 --> 00:52:05,978
我们会离开这里的 
We are going to get out of here.

731
00:52:09,193 --> 00:52:11,119
她要去开门 
She's going to open the door.

732
00:52:12,278 --> 00:52:13,743
你会在那里 
And you'll be there.

733
00:52:18,592 --> 00:52:19,642
我保证 
I promise.

734
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:25,385
让我们开始工作吧 
Let's get to work.

735
00:52:28,791 --> 00:52:31,853
花了很长时间 但我们做到了 
It took ages, but we did it.

736
00:52:33,650 --> 00:52:35,611
我们让它起死回生 
We brought it back to life.

737
00:52:38,127 --> 00:52:39,838
我们回家吧 
Let's go home.

738
00:52:44,072 --> 00:52:46,283
他的飞船是神经动力学的 
His ship was neurokinetic,

739
00:52:47,119 --> 00:52:49,119
与他的思想相连 
connected to his thoughts.

740
00:52:52,431 --> 00:52:57,252
当我摸到它的时候 我看到了他的思想 
When I touched it, I saw his mind.

741
00:52:58,767 --> 00:53:03,173
我感觉到他所做的一切 
I felt what he had done.

742
00:53:06,700 --> 00:53:08,447
整个世界……
Entire worlds...

743
00:53:09,127 --> 00:53:11,306
整个时间轴……
Entire timelines...

744
00:53:11,481 --> 00:53:13,481
走了,
Gone,

745
00:53:13,528 --> 00:53:15,588
就像他们从未存在过一样 
like they never even existed.

746
00:53:33,900 --> 00:53:35,064
珍妮特 
Janet.

747
00:53:39,710 --> 00:53:41,041
我们可以走了 
We can leave.

748
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:44,408
现在 
Right now.

749
00:53:49,219 --> 00:53:50,908
康是谁?
Who is Kang?

750
00:53:56,212 --> 00:53:57,791
我需要成为什么样的人 
Who I need to be.

751
00:54:01,817 --> 00:54:03,617
他不是在这里住的 
He didn't crash here.

752
00:54:03,642 --> 00:54:05,700
他被流放到这里 
He was exiled here.

753
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:09,700
在空间和时间之外 
Outside space and time.

754
00:54:10,892 --> 00:54:15,291
唯一能关住他的地方 
The only place that could hold him.

755
00:54:16,201 --> 00:54:18,963
被谁流放?
Exiled by who?

756
00:54:19,923 --> 00:54:21,408
我不知道 
I don't know.

757
00:54:23,394 --> 00:54:28,291
但他们破坏了他的飞船 把他困在这里
But they sabotaged his ship, and trapped him here

758
00:54:30,700 --> 00:54:34,947
因为我 他才得以脱身 
And because of me, he was getting out.

759
00:54:35,012 --> 00:54:36,470
珍妮特……
Janet...

760
00:54:38,829 --> 00:54:40,494
离开 
Stay away.

761
00:54:45,765 --> 00:54:47,634
你救了我的命 
You saved my life.

762
00:54:52,814 --> 00:54:54,548
我答应过你 
I made a promise.

763
00:55:01,229 --> 00:55:03,127
让我送你回家吧 
Just let me take you home.

764
00:55:04,575 --> 00:55:05,736
然后呢?
And then?

765
00:55:07,900 --> 00:55:09,650
你打算做什么？
What are you going to do?

766
00:55:20,900 --> 00:55:22,033
赢了 
Win.

767
00:55:40,443 --> 00:55:43,638
我告诉过你 时间不是你想的那样 
I told you. Time isn't what you think.

768
00:55:46,068 --> 00:55:50,419
我可以让你永远不会离开她 
I can make it so you never left her.

769
00:55:51,863 --> 00:55:54,818
希望会打开那扇门……
Hope is going to open the door...

770
00:55:56,146 --> 00:55:57,826
你会在那里 
And you'll be there.

771
00:55:58,833 --> 00:56:01,178
又有多少世界会灭亡?
And how many worlds will die?

772
00:56:02,600 --> 00:56:04,404
如果你能出来 
If you get out.

773
00:56:05,373 --> 00:56:06,935
不是你的 
Not yours.

774
00:56:08,654 --> 00:56:10,209
她永远不会知道的 
She'll never know.

775
00:56:15,006 --> 00:56:17,607
你不想再见到你女儿吗?
Don't you want to see your daughter again?

776
00:56:19,662 --> 00:56:21,724
我不能让你离开 
I can't let you leave.

777
00:56:23,833 --> 00:56:26,099
你凭什么认为你能阻止我?
Why do you think you can stop me?

778
00:56:43,614 --> 00:56:45,359
给我 珍妮特 
Give it to me, Janet.

779
00:56:46,473 --> 00:56:48,070
给我!
Give it to me!

780
00:56:48,340 --> 00:56:51,340
我打不过他 他太厉害了 
I couldn't beat him, he was too powerful.

781
00:56:52,234 --> 00:56:53,585
你做了什么?
What did you do?

782
00:56:57,655 --> 00:56:59,140
对不起 霍普 
I'm sorry, Hope.

783
00:57:01,452 --> 00:57:02,702
不!
No!

784
00:57:29,715 --> 00:57:33,700
我炸毁了他的核心 切断了他与时间的联系 
I blew up his core, cut him off from time.

785
00:57:34,307 --> 00:57:37,192
把我们俩永远困在这里 
And trapped us both down here forever.

786
00:57:39,410 --> 00:57:41,019
但我给了他足够的回报 
But I gave him back enough.

787
00:57:41,512 --> 00:57:43,307
既然他拿回了西装 
Now that he had his suit back,

788
00:57:43,332 --> 00:57:47,004
他变成了他一直以来的样子……
He became what he always was...

789
00:57:47,340 --> 00:57:49,125
一个征服者 
a Conqueror.

790
00:57:49,356 --> 00:57:52,026
他有武器和技术
He's got weapons and technology

791
00:57:52,051 --> 00:57:55,848
几百年来我们都无法想象 
centuries beyond anything we can dream of.

792
00:57:56,481 --> 00:58:00,301
他把他的监狱变成了他的帝国 
He took his prison and made it his empire.

793
00:58:01,420 --> 00:58:07,418
多年来我一直在和他斗争 逃避他 躲避他 
I spent years fighting him, running from him, hiding from him.

794
00:58:09,087 --> 00:58:10,707
然后你救了我 
And then you saved me.

795
00:58:13,810 --> 00:58:15,098
你带我回家 
You brought me home.

796
00:58:16,830 --> 00:58:18,238
但我不配 
But I didn't deserve it.

797
00:58:19,410 --> 00:58:24,950
我在这里释放了一个怪物 然后逃跑了 
I unleashed a monster on this place and ran away.

798
00:58:25,418 --> 00:58:29,231
珍妮特 你不可能知道 
Janet, you couldn't have known.

799
00:58:31,145 --> 00:58:33,192
对不起 我一直没告诉你 
I'm sorry I never told you.

800
00:58:34,252 --> 00:58:36,199
我只想忘记 
I just wanted to forget.

801
00:58:37,646 --> 00:58:39,864
我只是想再做一次你妈妈 
I just wanted to be your mom again.

802
00:58:45,376 --> 00:58:48,231
我很抱歉让你独自承受这一切 
I'm so sorry you had to go through all of that alone.

803
00:58:49,303 --> 00:58:51,910
但你现在并不孤单 
But you are not alone now.

804
00:58:55,461 --> 00:58:57,004
我们一起阻止他 
We'll stop him together.

805
00:58:57,739 --> 00:58:59,739
他的目标是核心 
He's after the core.

806
00:59:00,535 --> 00:59:03,010
但他需要皮姆粒子才能到达 
But he needs Pym Particles to reach it.

807
00:59:03,035 --> 00:59:06,473
如果他有斯科特和凯西 他就有皮姆粒子 
And if he's got Scott and Cassie, he's got Pym Particles.

808
00:59:06,498 --> 00:59:08,498
-而且领先一步 ——没错 
- And a headstart. - Exactly.

809
00:59:08,645 --> 00:59:09,700
我们得离开这里 
We got to get out of here.

810
00:59:09,766 --> 00:59:10,766
希望……
Hope...

811
00:59:10,791 --> 00:59:12,465
他出不去 
He cannot get out.

812
00:59:33,913 --> 00:59:35,625
你是个有趣的人……
You're an interesting man...

813
00:59:39,145 --> 00:59:40,187
斯科特·朗 
Scott Lang.

814
00:59:41,266 --> 00:59:46,450
我不知道你是谁 但你犯了个大错误 
Um, I don't know who you are, but you've made a big mistake.

815
00:59:46,979 --> 00:59:48,250
好吗?
Okay?

816
00:59:48,956 --> 00:59:50,328
我是复仇者 
I'm an Avenger.

817
00:59:51,311 --> 00:59:53,031
我给其他复仇者打过电话 
I've called the other Avengers.

818
00:59:53,179 --> 00:59:54,734
你是复仇者?
You're an Avenger?

819
00:59:56,710 --> 00:59:58,461
我以前杀过你吗?
Have I killed you before?

820
00:59:59,245 --> 01:00:00,530
什么?
What?

821
01:00:01,336 --> 01:00:03,773
一段时间后 他们都会一起流血 
They all bleed together after a while.

822
01:00:05,775 --> 01:00:07,398
你不是拿锤子的那个人吗?
You're not the one with the hammer?

823
01:00:07,423 --> 01:00:08,883
这是托尔 
That's Thor.

824
01:00:10,590 --> 01:00:13,023
我们经常感到困惑 相似的体型——
We get confused a lot. Similar body types ---

825
01:00:13,271 --> 01:00:14,430
你是谁?
who are you?

826
01:00:16,344 --> 01:00:17,757
只是一个男人……
Just a man...

827
01:00:18,250 --> 01:00:21,617
像你一样失去了很多时间 
who's lost a lot of time, like you.

828
01:00:23,814 --> 01:00:25,859
但我们可以互相帮助 
But we can help each other with that.

829
01:00:27,687 --> 01:00:29,637
验尸官说你是个好贼 
M.O.D.O.K tells me you're a good thief.

830
01:00:29,964 --> 01:00:32,250
是的 他偷了我的东西 
Yeah, he stole something from me.

831
01:00:33,973 --> 01:00:36,973
我在的时候别说话 
Do not speak when I'm in the room.

832
01:00:44,301 --> 01:00:46,948
不得不说 珍妮特帮了大忙 
Got to say, Janet was a lot more helpful.

833
01:00:47,472 --> 01:00:48,987
你也认识珍妮特?
You know Janet too?

834
01:00:50,090 --> 01:00:52,167
这里的人都认识珍妮特吗?
Does everyone down here know Janet?

835
01:00:53,622 --> 01:00:55,253
她没跟你提过我吗?
She didn't tell you about me?

836
01:00:59,921 --> 01:01:01,659
我想这并不奇怪 
I guess that's not a surprise.

837
01:01:04,100 --> 01:01:06,573
珍妮特偷了我的东西 
Janet stole something from me.

838
01:01:06,950 --> 01:01:09,519
我离开这里的机票 
My ticket out of here.

839
01:01:12,341 --> 01:01:14,816
而你是唯一能把它偷回来的人 
And you are the only one who can steal it back.

840
01:01:15,612 --> 01:01:17,129
我为什么要那么做?
And why would I do that?

841
01:01:17,663 --> 01:01:19,613
因为你想离开这里 
Because you want to get out of here.

842
01:01:20,448 --> 01:01:24,870
我得离开这里 
And I need to get out of here.

843
01:01:26,972 --> 01:01:28,622
因为我知道结局 
Because I know how it ends.

844
01:01:29,039 --> 01:01:30,761
结局如何?
How what ends?

845
01:01:34,129 --> 01:01:35,417
所有的一切 
All of it.

846
01:01:38,667 --> 01:01:42,230
我不是生活在一条直线上 
I don't live in a straight line.

847
01:01:44,738 --> 01:01:46,144
随着时间的推移……
And with time...

848
01:01:47,151 --> 01:01:50,386
很难不直接跳到结尾 
It's hard, not to skip to the end.

849
01:01:52,229 --> 01:01:55,073
所以 如果你想阻止即将发生的事情 
So, if you want to stop what's coming,

850
01:01:55,191 --> 01:01:58,749
相信我 你会……
and trust me, you do...

851
01:02:01,095 --> 01:02:03,131
我是你唯一的希望 
I am the only shot you have.

852
01:02:03,886 --> 01:02:05,419
未来是什么?
What's coming?

853
01:02:07,503 --> 01:02:08,600
我 
Me.

854
01:02:10,294 --> 01:02:12,975
我的很多东西 
A lot of me.

855
01:02:16,866 --> 01:02:20,975
他们把我流放到这里 
They exiled me down here.

856
01:02:24,113 --> 01:02:25,616
他们怕我 
They're afraid of me.

857
01:02:31,260 --> 01:02:34,944
但我是能带你回家的人 
But I'm the man who can get you home.

858
01:02:43,081 --> 01:02:46,647
那么 我们成交了吗?
So, do we have a deal?

859
01:02:49,957 --> 01:02:52,085
不 我不这么认为 
No, I don't think we do.

860
01:03:01,342 --> 01:03:02,256
爸爸!
Dad!

861
01:03:02,281 --> 01:03:04,374
让我给你解释清楚 
Let me make this easy for you.

862
01:03:05,014 --> 01:03:09,436
给我我需要的东西 否则我就当着你的面杀了你女儿 
You bring me what I need, or I will kill your daughter in front of you.

863
01:03:09,461 --> 01:03:11,530
然后 让你重温那一刻 
Then, make you relive that moment,

864
01:03:11,555 --> 01:03:14,708
一次又一次 在时间里 无休止地 
Over and over again, in time, endlessly,

865
01:03:14,756 --> 01:03:17,546
直到你求我杀了你 
until you beg me to kill you.

866
01:03:18,800 --> 01:03:20,335
你明白吗?
Do you understand?

867
01:03:23,913 --> 01:03:25,397
不要这样做 
Don't do this.

868
01:03:28,124 --> 01:03:31,046
我是一个喜欢被理解的人 
I'm a man who likes to be understood.

869
01:03:34,139 --> 01:03:35,186
爸爸!
Dad!

870
01:03:36,467 --> 01:03:38,327
别听他的 
Don't listen to him.

871
01:03:40,163 --> 01:03:41,364
不!不!看,
No! No! Look,

872
01:03:41,389 --> 01:03:42,700
我们可以谈谈这个 
we can talk about this.

873
01:03:42,700 --> 01:03:43,700
不要这样做!
Don't do it!

874
01:03:43,889 --> 01:03:45,428
你真的应该这么做 
You really should do it.

875
01:03:45,645 --> 01:03:46,741
拜托 
Please.

876
01:03:47,952 --> 01:03:50,460
那是我女儿!请……
That's my daughter! Please...

877
01:03:50,485 --> 01:03:53,147
你想让她活下去还是死?
Do you want her to live or do you want her to die?

878
01:03:53,172 --> 01:03:54,172
拜托!
Please!

879
01:03:54,426 --> 01:03:55,702
你觉得我在撒谎吗?
Do you think I'm lying?

880
01:03:56,669 --> 01:03:58,897
你觉得我像骗子吗?
Do I look like a liar to you?

881
01:03:59,889 --> 01:04:00,913
停!
Stop!

882
01:04:01,278 --> 01:04:03,139
——爸爸!-我来!我会做的 
- Dad! - I'll do it! I'll do it.

883
01:04:03,164 --> 01:04:06,592
我来吧 放她走!放开她!放开她!
I'll do it, just let her go! Let her go! Let her go!

884
01:04:17,131 --> 01:04:19,084
你不自量力了…
You're out of your league...

885
01:04:20,484 --> 01:04:21,725
的眼界 
Ant-Man.

886
01:04:27,707 --> 01:04:29,373
很高兴我需要你 
Just be glad I need you.

887
01:04:42,776 --> 01:04:46,239
别再碰她 
Don't touch her again.

888
01:04:46,606 --> 01:04:48,482
那就给我我想要的 
Then give me what I need.

889
01:04:49,926 --> 01:04:51,544
它在哪里?
Where is it?

890
01:05:32,481 --> 01:05:34,307
那是什么?
What is that?

891
01:05:34,332 --> 01:05:36,801
这是一个多重引擎核心 
It was a multiversal engine core.

892
01:05:38,239 --> 01:05:42,192
一种能把你带到时空任何地方的电源 
A power source that could take you anywhere in space and time.

893
01:05:43,606 --> 01:05:45,036
然后珍妮特把它炸毁了 
Then Janet blew it up.

894
01:05:49,531 --> 01:05:52,421
-在里面?-就是这个 
- It's in that? - It is that.

895
01:05:53,117 --> 01:05:55,257
我们必须到达中心 
And we have to get to the center.

896
01:05:56,109 --> 01:05:57,648
很高兴知道这一点 
That's good to know.

897
01:05:59,257 --> 01:06:02,398
你得缩成一团 穿过风暴中心 
You'll have to shrink down and pass through the eye of the storm.

898
01:06:02,700 --> 01:06:07,121
一旦你进去了 找到核心并缩小它的大小 
Once you're inside, find the core and size it back down.

899
01:06:07,146 --> 01:06:08,700
它看起来像什么?
What does it look like?

900
01:06:08,700 --> 01:06:11,161
当我偷东西的时候 我通常知道我在偷什么 
When I steal something, I usually know what I'm stealing.

901
01:06:11,186 --> 01:06:12,826
你一看到就知道了 
You'll know it when you see it.

902
01:06:13,076 --> 01:06:15,217
以最快的速度进出 
Get in and out as fast as you can.

903
01:06:15,598 --> 01:06:19,225
你在里面的时间越长 你的思想就越混乱 
The longer you're in there, the more your mind will come undone.

904
01:06:21,583 --> 01:06:22,858
最好快点 
Better hurry.

905
01:06:27,139 --> 01:06:28,428
我很抱歉 
I'm sorry.

906
01:06:29,035 --> 01:06:30,529
这都是我的错 
This is all my fault.

907
01:06:34,256 --> 01:06:35,264
不 
No.

908
01:06:36,490 --> 01:06:38,279
我搞砸了 
I messed up.

909
01:06:38,803 --> 01:06:42,959
凯西 我的人生都是因为我搞砸了 
Cassie, my whole life happened because I messed up.

910
01:06:44,250 --> 01:06:47,232
我唯一没搞砸的 就是你 
The only thing I didn't mess up, is you.

911
01:06:50,154 --> 01:06:51,264
爸爸!
Dad!

912
01:06:52,028 --> 01:06:54,506
没关系 没关系 
It's okay. It's okay.

913
01:06:57,014 --> 01:06:58,700
我爱你 花生 
I love you, Peanut.

914
01:06:59,506 --> 01:07:00,998
我也爱你 
I love you, too.

915
01:07:44,664 --> 01:07:47,364
好的 我在 
Okay. I'm in.

916
01:07:50,450 --> 01:07:52,450
达伦 能听到我说话吗?
Darren, can you hear me?

917
01:07:52,669 --> 01:07:53,669
达伦?
Darren?

918
01:07:54,850 --> 01:07:55,873
达伦?

你正处于概率风暴中

940
01:08:45,150 --> 01:08:47,406

-你不知道?-我怎么会知道?

他在说什么?他在说什么?

你在Schrödinger的盒子里 你是那只猫 
You're inside Schrödinger's box, and you're the cat.

951

我们为什么要听你的?
Why should we listen to you?

955

你甚至都不是真的 
You're not even the real one.

956
01:09:17,850 --> 01:09:18,700
-等等 我不是?-谁是真的?
- Wait, I'm not? - Who's the real one?

你为什么穿成这样?
Why are you dressed like that?

966
01:09:32,630 --> 01:09:34,439
因为我在巴斯金罗宾斯工作

1068
01:18:07,494 --> 01:18:09,644
当你触动我的心灵 
When you touched my mind,

1069
01:18:20,895 --> 01:18:22,645
你看到了什么?

就像我这样 你都不用闭上眼睛 
the way I do, you don't get to close your eyes.

1074

你是唯一一个看到的人吗?

我是唯一能看见的人
I am the only one that can see

1076
01:18:39,085 --> 01:18:40,207
它坏了 
it's broken.

1077
01:18:40,387 --> 01:18:41,582
谁打破的?
And who broke it?

1078
01:18:44,292 --> 01:18:45,387
我做到了 
I did.

1079
01:18:46,554 --> 01:18:49,527
每一个版本的我 
Every version of me.

1080
01:18:50,715 --> 01:18:55,246
我的变体 在多元宇宙中…
My variants, throughout the multiverse...

1081
01:18:56,687 --> 01:18:59,637
像孩子一样和时间玩耍 
play with time like children.

1082
01:19:02,168 --> 01:19:06,488
但我看到结局了 
But I saw how it ends.

1083
01:19:06,543 --> 01:19:12,058
我看到他们的混乱在现实中蔓延 
I saw their chaos spreading across realities.

1084
01:19:13,567 --> 01:19:16,316
宇宙碰撞 
Universes colliding.

1085
01:19:17,175 --> 01:19:19,191
无尽的入侵 
Endless incursions.

1086
01:19:19,875 --> 01:19:21,879
我看到了多元宇宙……
I saw the multiverse...

1087
01:19:22,910 --> 01:19:24,910
它正在死去 
that it was dying.

1088
01:19:26,004 --> 01:19:27,700
都是因为他们 
All because of them.

1089
01:19:28,902 --> 01:19:30,700
所以我控制了局面 
So I took control.

1090
01:19:31,176 --> 01:19:33,176
你是说你挑起了一场战争 
You mean you started a war.

1091
01:19:33,793 --> 01:19:35,973
现在你想要抹去所有宇宙
And now you want to wipe away any universe

1092
01:19:35,998 --> 01:19:37,848
那是对你的威胁 
that's a threat to you.

1093
01:19:38,355 --> 01:19:39,948
怪物就会这样 
That's what monsters do.

1094
01:19:39,973 --> 01:19:43,277
这就是征服者所做的 
That's what conquerors do.

1095
01:19:43,669 --> 01:19:46,176
他们烧毁了这个破碎的世界 
They burn the broken world.

1096
01:19:47,395 --> 01:19:50,160
他们制造了一个新的 
And they make a new one.

1097
01:19:50,528 --> 01:19:53,528
你根本不在乎拯救任何人或事 
You don't care about saving anything or anyone.

1098
01:19:55,200 --> 01:19:58,066
你想复仇只是因为他们打了你 
You only want revenge because they beat you.

1099
01:19:58,462 --> 01:19:59,512
因为你输了 
Because you lost.

1100
01:19:59,537 --> 01:20:01,537
我输了 
I have lost.

1101
01:20:03,332 --> 01:20:07,700
你不知道我失去了什么 
You have no idea what I've lost.

1102
01:20:09,100 --> 01:20:12,700
我会把他们烧尽 
And I will burn them out of time,

1103
01:20:13,019 --> 01:20:14,604
为他们对我做的事道歉 
for what they've done to me.

1104
01:20:15,395 --> 01:20:19,395
你会抹去整个时间线
You'll be wiping out entire timelines,

1105
01:20:20,013 --> 01:20:23,129
谋杀了数万亿人 
murdering trillions of people.

1106
01:20:24,598 --> 01:20:26,848
我希望这很重要 珍妮特 
I wish that mattered, Janet.

1107
01:20:48,681 --> 01:20:50,556
天啊 我在做什么 
Oh, God, what am I doing.

1108
01:21:01,275 --> 01:21:02,400
什么?
What?

1109
01:21:06,649 --> 01:21:07,892
汉克 
Hank.

1110
01:21:11,240 --> 01:21:13,164
这些是你的蚂蚁吗?
Are these your ants?

1111
01:21:13,333 --> 01:21:14,570
从蚂蚁农场?
From the ant farm?

1112
01:21:14,595 --> 01:21:16,595
是的 斯科特 它们是我的蚂蚁 
Yes, Scott, they're my ants.

1113
01:21:16,783 --> 01:21:18,683
你怎么在这里找到他们的?
How did you find them down here?

1114
01:21:19,550 --> 01:21:22,700
自从飞机坠毁后 我一直接收到奇怪的信号 
I've been picking up strange signals ever since we crashed.

1115
01:21:24,459 --> 01:21:27,242
一开始我以为可能是故障 
First I thought maybe it was a malfunction,

1116
01:21:27,267 --> 01:21:29,062
某种干扰?
some kind of interference?

1117
01:21:29,102 --> 01:21:30,875
那是什么?
What is that?

1118
01:21:31,276 --> 01:21:32,351
但事实并非如此 
But it wasn't.

1119
01:21:33,717 --> 01:21:34,875
是蚂蚁 
It was the ants.

1120
01:21:36,714 --> 01:21:39,614
他们一直都在联系我 
They were reaching out the whole time.

1121
01:21:41,254 --> 01:21:45,000
显然他们经历了某种时间膨胀 
Apparently they passed through some sort of time dilation.

1122
01:21:45,176 --> 01:21:48,391
他们在一天之内活了几千年 
They lived thousands of years in a single day.

1123
01:21:48,559 --> 01:21:51,559
扩大他们的知识和科学…
Expanding their knowledge, their science...

1124
01:21:51,700 --> 01:21:55,125
变得比我想象的还要先进 
Becoming more advanced than I could have ever thought.

1125
01:21:55,150 --> 01:21:56,700
我没有找到他们 
I didn't find them.

1126
01:21:57,350 --> 01:21:58,700
他们找到我了 
They found me.

1127
01:22:00,297 --> 01:22:02,562
我说过他们很聪明 
I told you they were smart.

1128
01:22:04,656 --> 01:22:07,858
他们已经建立了一些技术官僚 
They've already built something of a technocratic,

1129
01:22:07,883 --> 01:22:09,758
二班文明 
class-two civilization.

1130
01:22:09,926 --> 01:22:13,272
我是说 我知道社会主义是个充满争议的词 
I mean, I know socialism is a charged word,

1131
01:22:13,297 --> 01:22:15,172
但是我们可以从这些中学到很多……
but we can learn a lot from these...

1132
01:22:15,197 --> 01:22:16,226
爸爸 
Dad.

1133
01:22:16,984 --> 01:22:18,700
是的 它们是我的蚂蚁 
Yeah, they're my ants.

1134
01:22:18,810 --> 01:22:20,885
蚂蚁不会放弃 
And ants don't give up.

1135
01:22:20,910 --> 01:22:22,414
我才不管这家伙是谁 
I don't care who this guy is.

1136
01:22:22,439 --> 01:22:24,898
我不管他能做什么 我要救凯西 
I don't care what he can do, I'm getting Cassie.

1137
01:22:25,029 --> 01:22:27,629
那我们怎么才能扳回一局?
So, how do we even the odds against Kang?

1138
01:22:30,742 --> 01:22:32,273
我们有一些想法 
We've got some ideas.

1139
01:22:32,298 --> 01:22:33,351
你在想什么?
What are you thinking?

1140
01:22:33,376 --> 01:22:36,376
一位伟大的作家曾经说过……
Well, as a great writer once said...

1141
01:22:37,503 --> 01:22:39,503
总有成长的空间 
There's always room to grow.

1142
01:22:41,961 --> 01:22:43,562
你读了我的书?
You read my book?

1143
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:47,172
每一个该死的字 
Every goddamn word.

1144
01:22:49,914 --> 01:22:51,614
来吧 让我们开始工作吧 
Come on. Let's go to work.

1145
01:23:04,148 --> 01:23:06,172
嘿!我很抱歉 
Hey! I'm sorry.

1146
01:23:06,470 --> 01:23:08,172
那可能很可怕 
That was probably terrifying.

1147
01:23:08,197 --> 01:23:09,969
你在这里做什么?
What are you doing here?

1148
01:23:10,200 --> 01:23:11,476
我在救你 
I'm rescuing you.

1149
01:23:11,934 --> 01:23:12,934
如何?
How?

1150
01:23:14,478 --> 01:23:16,000
这是个好问题 
That's a good question.

1151
01:23:16,567 --> 01:23:20,148
这东西有钥匙或卡片吗?
Does this thing have like a key or a card?

1152
01:23:20,187 --> 01:23:21,481
比如房间钥匙?
Like a room key?

1153
01:23:21,606 --> 01:23:22,606
你知道 就像…
You know, like a...

1154
01:23:24,815 --> 01:23:25,818
大便 
Shit.

1155
01:23:33,326 --> 01:23:34,700
跳和轻拍 
Jump and tap.

1156
01:23:43,906 --> 01:23:47,700
詹托拉 我很抱歉害了你的人 
Jentorra, I'm sorry I got your people hurt.

1157
01:23:49,479 --> 01:23:50,867
我能帮什么忙?
How can I help?

1158
01:23:56,867 --> 01:23:58,413
让我们回敬他们 
Let's hurt them back.

1159
01:23:58,438 --> 01:24:00,430
该死 你真酷 
Damn, your cool.

1160
01:24:01,266 --> 01:24:02,485
你有计划吗?
Do you have a plan?

1161
01:24:02,510 --> 01:24:04,070
释放你基本上是我的计划 
Freeing you was basically my plan.

1162
01:24:04,842 --> 01:24:05,842
你有计划吗?
Do you have a plan?

1163
01:24:05,899 --> 01:24:08,500
我们得给所有还能战斗的人传个信 
We need to get a message out to anyone who can still fight.

1164
01:24:08,700 --> 01:24:10,500
那就把我们的人从下面的拘留所释放出来
Then free our people from the detention cells below

1165
01:24:10,525 --> 01:24:12,188
然后从内部发起反击 
and launch a counteroffense from within.

1166
01:24:12,213 --> 01:24:14,477
是的 你有个计划 那我们怎么把消息传出去?
Yeah, you have a plan. So, how do we get the message out?

1167
01:24:14,502 --> 01:24:16,789
-跟我来 -好的 太好了 
- Follow me. - Okay, great.

1168
01:24:21,242 --> 01:24:24,274
我在这里建立了一个帝国 珍妮特 
I built an empire down here, Janet.

1169
01:24:26,539 --> 01:24:28,500
我要把它带走 
And I'm taking it with me.

1170
01:24:44,227 --> 01:24:47,141
你真该在有机会的时候放我出去 
You really should have let me out when you had the chance.

1171
01:24:56,419 --> 01:24:59,419
历史不是写出来的 
History is not written.

1172
01:25:01,550 --> 01:25:03,700
这是伪造的 
It is forged.

1173
01:25:03,700 --> 01:25:05,219
今天 我们得救了 
Today, we are saved.

1174
01:25:06,250 --> 01:25:11,375
在这座堡垒里 我要向放逐我的人复仇 
From this fortress, I will take my revenge on those who banished me.

1175
01:25:12,485 --> 01:25:16,047
今天 我们征服永恒 
Today, we conquer eternity.

1176
01:25:16,741 --> 01:25:19,100
而康朝……
And the dynasty of Kang...

1177
01:25:22,555 --> 01:25:23,700
喂?
Hello?

1178
01:25:23,750 --> 01:25:25,227
这有用吗?
Is this working?

1179
01:25:25,252 --> 01:25:26,252
卡西?
Cassie?

1180
01:25:26,535 --> 01:25:28,242
我不知道它是否有效 
I can't tell if it's working.

1181
01:25:29,563 --> 01:25:31,305
好了 我们开始吧 
Okay, I think we're on.

1182
01:25:31,330 --> 01:25:32,760
我来拖住他们 把信息传出去 
I'll hold them off. Get the message out.

1183
01:25:32,785 --> 01:25:34,555
我以为你要把消息传出去 
I thought you were getting the message out.

1184
01:25:36,574 --> 01:25:37,574
现在!
Now!

1185
01:25:38,514 --> 01:25:39,477
我们在里面!
We're inside!

1186
01:25:39,539 --> 01:25:41,078
我们攻破了塔 
We've breached the tower.

1187
01:25:41,103 --> 01:25:42,297
我和詹托拉在一起 
I'm with Jentorra.

1188
01:25:42,322 --> 01:25:43,661
他不是不可战胜的 
He's not invincible.

1189
01:25:49,625 --> 01:25:53,352
我知道你可能觉得已经太迟了 
I know it might feel like it's too late.

1190
01:25:53,700 --> 01:25:57,110
我们所做的就是输 
Like, all we do is just lose.

1191
01:25:57,153 --> 01:25:59,153
但我失去的家人
But the family I lost,

1192
01:25:59,473 --> 01:26:01,211
教会我要继续战斗 
taught me to keep fighting.

1193
01:26:01,480 --> 01:26:03,812
如果他们在这里 他们也会的 
And if they were here, they would, too.

1194
01:26:04,152 --> 01:26:06,152
我们得照顾小家伙 
We need to look out for the little guy.

1195
01:26:06,660 --> 01:26:08,039
这是我爸爸教我的 
My dad taught me that.

1196
01:26:08,566 --> 01:26:10,566
因为当人们需要帮助的时候
Because when people needed help,

1197
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:12,836
他没有视而不见 
he didn't look the other way.

1198
01:26:13,153 --> 01:26:14,281
我们也不知道 
And neither do we.

1199
01:26:16,590 --> 01:26:17,700
我们得走了!
We need to move!

1200
01:26:17,700 --> 01:26:19,270
到塔里来!
Come to the tower!

1201
01:26:19,295 --> 01:26:20,295
反击!
Fight back!

1202
01:26:20,320 --> 01:26:21,320
我知道你一直在等 
I know you've been waiting.

1203
01:26:21,345 --> 01:26:22,745
现在是时候出击了 
Now is the time to strike.

1204
01:26:22,770 --> 01:26:24,770
他知道他不能带走我们所有人 
He knows he can't take all of us.

1205
01:26:24,989 --> 01:26:26,121
来拖车…
Come to the tow...

1206
01:26:26,675 --> 01:26:28,675
——卡西 -我想我找到信号了 
- Cassie. - I think I found the signal.

1207
01:26:28,700 --> 01:26:29,700
妈妈也得去 
Mom's gotta be there, too.

1208
01:26:29,700 --> 01:26:31,137
-走吧!-我来开 
- Let's go! - I'll drive.

1209
01:26:37,575 --> 01:26:39,192
找到朗的女儿 
Find Lang's daughter.

1210
01:26:42,184 --> 01:26:43,590
杀了她 
Kill her.

1211
01:27:02,202 --> 01:27:03,700
我们走吧 我们走吧 
Let's go. Let's go.

1212
01:27:03,700 --> 01:27:05,700
如果你想打架 跟我来 
If you want to fight, follow me.

1213
01:27:10,030 --> 01:27:11,700
都结束了 凯西 
It's over, Cassie.

1214
01:27:11,766 --> 01:27:12,987
释放其他人 
Free the others.

1215
01:27:13,012 --> 01:27:14,012
走吧!
Go!

1216
01:27:21,395 --> 01:27:22,700
他会看到我们来的 
He is gonna see us coming.

1217
01:27:22,700 --> 01:27:24,700
好的 我会确保的 
Yeah, I'll make sure of it.

1218
01:27:25,696 --> 01:27:27,262
开始发射 
Begin the launch.

1219
01:28:18,917 --> 01:28:20,878
你爸爸不在这里 凯西 
Your dad's not here, Cassie.

1220
01:28:21,247 --> 01:28:23,198
但我想这也没什么好惊讶的 
But I guess that's not a big surprise.

1221
01:28:46,348 --> 01:28:48,058
康!
Kang!

1222
01:28:48,863 --> 01:28:51,301
我们说好的!
We had a deal!

1223
01:28:52,925 --> 01:28:55,746
你带走了我的女儿!
You took my daughter!

1224
01:28:57,543 --> 01:29:00,700
天呐这是大的 
Holy shit. That's big.

1225
01:29:09,238 --> 01:29:10,700
你骗了我 
You lied to me.

1226
01:29:12,247 --> 01:29:14,247
我们的话就是我们的誓言 
Our word is our vow.

1227
01:29:15,316 --> 01:29:18,167
没有这些 我们什么都不是 
Without that, we're nothing.

1228
01:29:19,700 --> 01:29:20,700
把他抓下来

1341
01:43:32,300 --> 01:43:33,500

我们都只能输

1361
01:47:28,695 --> 01:47:29,906
爸爸!

她是好的 
She's okay.

1366
01:47:43,351 --> 01:47:45,200
斯科特 她没事 他们都很好 
Scott, she's okay. They're all okay.

1367
01:47:46,031 --> 01:47:47,250
你做到了 
You did it.

1368
01:47:50,406 --> 01:47:52,328
-对不起 对不起 对不起……-不不不

1370
01:47:54,476 --> 01:47:55,473

1371
01:47:55,726 --> 01:47:57,025

1376
01:49:33,470 --> 01:49:34,812
我们回家吧 
Let's go home.

1377
01:49:37,524 --> 01:49:38,758
家里很好 
Home's good.

1378
01:49:47,191 --> 01:49:48,571
我的生活毫无意义 
My life doesn't make sense.

1379
01:49:49,029 --> 01:49:51,312
我曾经问过自己很多关于这方面的问题 
I used to ask myself a lot of questions about that.

1380
01:49:51,613 --> 01:49:54,275
斯科特 你刚刚和家人一起拯救了量子王国 
Scott, you just saved the quantum realm with your family,

1381
01:49:54,300 --> 01:49:56,189
喝了一个没有洞的人 
and drank a guy without holes.

1382
01:49:56,375 --> 01:49:58,375
为什么这种事总是发生在你身上?
Why does this kind of stuff keep happening to you?

1383
01:49:58,400 --> 01:50:00,263
这没有任何意义 
That doesn't make any sense.

1384
01:50:00,450 --> 01:50:01,904
你知道吗?
Well, you know what?

1385
01:50:02,071 --> 01:50:03,861
谁说生活必须有意义?
Who said life has to make sense?

1386
01:50:08,392 --> 01:50:11,044
-鲁本 -你才是臭虫!
- Ruben. - You are the bug!

1387
01:50:11,412 --> 01:50:12,820
是的 我错了 
I was wrong, yeah.

1388
01:50:12,854 --> 01:50:14,602
你是另一只虫子 
You are the other bug.

1389
01:50:14,662 --> 01:50:15,974
你是虫人 
You're the bug-man.

1390
01:50:16,013 --> 01:50:18,653
你会变大 也会变小 就像一只大虫子 
You get big, and get small, like a big bug.

1391
01:50:19,193 --> 01:50:20,940
你是对的 那就是我 
You're right. That's me.

1392
01:50:20,965 --> 01:50:22,190
请来杯咖啡 
Just a coffee, please.

1393
01:50:22,271 --> 01:50:23,353
十二美元 
Twelve dollar.

1394
01:50:25,086 --> 01:50:26,113
十二个!
Twelve!

1395
01:50:26,205 --> 01:50:28,685
我曾经怀疑我生命中的这一篇章是否已经结束 
I used to wonder if this chapter in my life was over.

1396
01:50:28,710 --> 01:50:31,852
但正如凯西提醒我的 总有人是你可以帮助的 
But as Cassie reminded me, there is always someone you can help.

1397
01:50:32,652 --> 01:50:35,231
从做蛋糕退休了 
Came out of cake- making retirement for ya.

1398
01:50:39,654 --> 01:50:40,779
你自己做的?
You made this yourself?

1399
01:50:40,804 --> 01:50:42,474
是的 我通常不做蛋糕 
Yeah, I don't usually make the cakes.

1400
01:50:42,499 --> 01:50:43,264
我知道 
I know.

1401
01:50:43,289 --> 01:50:45,302
这是我自1997年以来做的第一个 
This is the first one I made since 1997.

1402
01:50:45,327 --> 01:50:46,474
你真是个艺术家 
You're a real artist.

1403
01:50:46,865 --> 01:50:48,615
这是一段相当疯狂的旅程 
It's been a pretty wild ride.

1404
01:50:48,935 --> 01:50:51,200
有一天 你被巴斯金·罗宾斯公司解雇了 
One day, you're fired from Baskin Robbins,

1405
01:50:51,215 --> 01:50:54,380
下一秒 你就打败了穿越时空的太空王 
The next, you're beating a time-traveling Space King.

1406
01:50:55,104 --> 01:50:57,201
我们打败他了 对吧?
We did beat him, right?

1407
01:50:58,716 --> 01:51:00,333
我是说 是的 事情就是这样 
I mean, yeah, that's what happened.

1408
01:51:00,468 --> 01:51:02,232
他要出来了 但他没出来 
He was getting out and he didn't get out.

1409
01:51:03,704 --> 01:51:04,919
我认为 
I think.

1410
01:51:06,666 --> 01:51:09,180
但他也说有不好的事情要发生 
But he also said something bad was coming.

1411
01:51:09,413 --> 01:51:12,063
如果他不出来 所有人都会死 
And that everyone would die if he didn't get out.

1412
01:51:12,767 --> 01:51:15,267
等等 我把所有人都杀了吗?
Wait, so did I just kill everyone?

1413
01:51:15,677 --> 01:51:17,998
所有人都会因为我而死吗?
Is everyone gonna die because of me?

1414
01:51:18,092 --> 01:51:19,130
我的天啊 
Oh, my God.

1415
01:51:20,114 --> 01:51:21,700
哦,我的……我做了什么?
Oh, my... what did I do.

1416
01:51:23,678 --> 01:51:25,120
我做了什么?
What did I do?

1417
01:51:28,851 --> 01:51:29,763
你知道吗?
You know what?

1418
01:51:29,900 --> 01:51:31,400
可能还好 
It's probably fine.

1419
01:51:31,400 --> 01:51:33,654
就像我说的 生活没有任何意义 
Like I said, life doesn't make any sense.

1420
01:51:33,679 --> 01:51:36,849
所以别再问这么多问题了 斯科特 
So maybe stop asking so many questions, Scott.

1421
01:51:36,874 --> 01:51:38,708
不要想太多 
Stop overthinking it.

1422
01:51:41,085 --> 01:51:42,702
惊喜!
Surprise!

1423
01:51:48,502 --> 01:51:49,550
今天不是我的生日 
It's not my birthday.

1424
01:51:49,969 --> 01:51:52,466
我知道 但我错过了一些 
I know. But I missed a few.

1425
01:51:54,409 --> 01:51:55,482
这很好 
This is good.

1426
01:51:55,605 --> 01:51:56,653
我们都在一起 
We're all together.

1427
01:51:57,089 --> 01:51:58,106
我们很好 
We're fine.

1428
01:51:58,340 --> 01:52:01,482
一切……可能很好 
Everything's... probably fine.

1429
01:52:01,700 --> 01:52:02,956
康的消失了 
Kang's gone.

1430
01:52:02,981 --> 01:52:04,091
我们做到了 
We did it.

1431
01:52:04,993 --> 01:52:07,243
不用再担心那家伙了 
Don't have to worry about that guy anymore.

1432
01:52:07,268 --> 01:52:08,268
好了 
Nice.

1433
01:52:11,468 --> 01:52:14,099
假生日快乐 凯西 
Happy fake birthday, Cassie.

1434
01:54:51,326 --> 01:54:55,138
那么 那个被流放的人死了 
So, the exiled one is dead.

1435
01:54:56,997 --> 01:54:59,372
你确定他死了?
You're sure he's dead?

1436
01:54:59,779 --> 01:55:02,312
如果不是真的 我就不会给你打电话 
If it wasn't true I wouldn't call you.

1437
01:55:03,419 --> 01:55:06,239
你肯定很难过 你不是杀他的人 
Must really eat you up that you're not the one who killed him.

1438
01:55:06,817 --> 01:55:09,613
没有人……
None of us...

1439
01:55:10,091 --> 01:55:12,067
杀了他 
killed him.

1440
01:55:14,131 --> 01:55:15,318
他们所做的 
They did.

1441
01:55:16,420 --> 01:55:20,982
他们开始接触多元宇宙 
They are beginning to touch the multiverse.

1442
01:55:21,763 --> 01:55:25,208
如果我们放任不管 他们会带走…
And if we let them, they will take...

1443
01:55:26,732 --> 01:55:28,474
一切
everything

1444
01:55:29,408 --> 01:55:31,072
我们已经做到了
we've built.

1445
01:55:32,205 --> 01:55:35,228
所以我们不要再浪费时间了 
So let's stop wasting time.

1446
01:55:38,626 --> 01:55:39,626
我们迟到了 
We're late.

1447
01:55:41,704 --> 01:55:44,118
你打了多少个电话?
How many did you call?

1448
01:55:44,392 --> 01:55:46,727
给我们所有人 
All of us.

1449
01:56:22,121 --> 01:56:23,121
