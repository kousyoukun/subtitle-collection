<i>Thousands gathered</i>

10
00:01:38,327 --> 00:01:39,858
<i>in the Bay Area last night</i>

11
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:43,161
<i>to honor the victims
of the 2014 attacks.</i>

12
00:01:43,163 --> 00:01:45,864
<i>Part of a wave
of memorials and protests</i>

13
00:01:45,866 --> 00:01:49,301
<i>demanding that the secretive
monster-hunting coalition</i>

14
00:01:49,303 --> 00:01:51,736
<i>known as Monarch
be held accountable.</i>

15
00:01:51,738 --> 00:01:54,007
<i>The recent spike
in mass die-offs</i>

16
00:01:54,009 --> 00:01:55,807
<i>in the world's oceans</i>

17
00:01:55,809 --> 00:01:58,343
<i>could be caused by efforts

18
00:01:58,345 --> 00:02:00,914
<i>who hasn't been seen

19
00:02:00,916 --> 00:02:03,650
<i>Top brass at the mysterious
Monarch organization</i>

20

<i>will face
another intense grilling</i>

21
00:02:05,319 --> 00:02:07,220
<i>as the government continues</i>

22
00:02:07,222 --> 00:02:09,622
<i>to push for extermination
of the Titans.</i>

23
00:02:09,624 --> 00:02:11,992
<i>And rumors persist

24
00:02:11,994 --> 00:02:15,862
<i>even more creatures discovered
since the attacks of 2014.</i>

25
00:02:15,864 --> 00:02:18,064
<i>A historic tragedy
that changed the world</i>

26
00:02:18,066 --> 00:02:19,732
<i>as we know it forever.</i>

27
00:02:19,734 --> 00:02:24,072
<i>The day the world discovered
that monsters are real.</i>

28
00:02:55,837 --> 00:02:58,237
Shit!

29
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:01,975
Shit, shit, shit!

30
00:03:01,977 --> 00:03:03,209
- Oh...
- Maddie?

31
00:03:03,211 --> 00:03:04,376
Good morning!

32
00:03:04,378 --> 00:03:06,379
- Good morning, Mom!
- Oh, God!

33
00:03:06,381 --> 00:03:07,679
- Uh...
- Okay.

34
00:03:09,518 --> 00:03:12,152
I made us breakfast.

35
00:03:12,154 --> 00:03:14,120
It's, uh...

36
00:03:14,122 --> 00:03:17,292
Eggs, toast,
and what was once bacon.

37
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:20,493
And which do you recommend?

38
00:03:20,495 --> 00:03:22,196
The toast and eggs.

39
00:03:23,198 --> 00:03:24,667
Thank you.

40
00:03:27,568 --> 00:03:29,203
Coffee?

41
00:03:32,406 --> 00:03:34,273
What were you working on?

42
00:03:34,275 --> 00:03:36,344
Um, I was looking at recipes.

43
00:03:36,912 --> 00:03:38,414
For toast?

44
00:03:41,182 --> 00:03:43,683
Dad's been emailing me.

45
00:03:43,685 --> 00:03:45,017
But he looks good.

46
00:03:45,019 --> 00:03:46,287
Healthy.

47
00:03:48,656 --> 00:03:49,822
Have you responded?

48
00:03:49,824 --> 00:03:51,291
Not yet.

49
00:03:51,293 --> 00:03:53,025
Madison, I just don't want to
see you get hurt.

50
00:03:53,027 --> 00:03:54,626
I know.

51
00:03:54,628 --> 00:03:56,028
Especially with everything
that's going on right now.

52
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:57,499
Mom, I know.

53
00:04:01,636 --> 00:04:05,171
Listen, I know things
haven't been easy for you.

54
00:04:05,173 --> 00:04:07,540
But we're gonna
get through this.

55
00:04:07,542 --> 00:04:09,075
Together.

56
00:04:09,077 --> 00:04:11,410
You sure he's gonna be okay?

57
00:04:11,412 --> 00:04:15,216
He is in the safest place
that he could be right now.

58
00:04:16,852 --> 00:04:18,686
You wanna hear some good news?

59
00:04:20,254 --> 00:04:22,021
I finished it.

60
00:04:22,023 --> 00:04:23,559
Really?

61
00:04:25,826 --> 00:04:28,026
You think it's gonna work?

62
00:04:28,028 --> 00:04:30,028
It's gonna work.

63
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,589
It's gonna be okay.

64
00:04:55,222 --> 00:04:56,355
<i>Doctor Russell,</i>

65
00:04:56,357 --> 00:04:58,092
<i>we need you in Containment.</i>

66
00:04:59,193 --> 00:05:01,160
I'm on my way.

67
00:05:12,974 --> 00:05:14,107
<i>What the hell happened?</i>

68
00:05:14,109 --> 00:05:15,240
No idea.

69
00:05:15,242 --> 00:05:16,542
She was sleeping like a baby

70
00:05:16,544 --> 00:05:17,977
until an hour ago,
and then, boom.

71
00:05:17,979 --> 00:05:19,511
Her radiation levels
went through the roof.

72
00:05:19,513 --> 00:05:21,081
Almost like
something triggered it.

73
00:05:21,083 --> 00:05:22,614
Thanks, Tim.

74
00:05:22,616 --> 00:05:24,217
I can take it from here.
Why don't you get some rest?

75
00:05:24,219 --> 00:05:25,617
No way.

76
00:05:25,619 --> 00:05:27,756
Sleep or no sleep,
I'm not missing this.

77
00:05:41,302 --> 00:05:44,636
<i>Containment team,
move into primary position.</i>

78
00:05:45,974 --> 00:05:47,874
- Sedatives?
- No effect.

79
00:05:47,876 --> 00:05:50,212
This thing wants to be born.

80
00:05:52,513 --> 00:05:55,013
<i>Emergency protocol
is in effect.</i>

81
00:05:55,015 --> 00:05:57,016
<i>Ten seconds to biocontainment.</i>

82
00:05:57,018 --> 00:05:59,087
Her time has come.

83
00:06:26,948 --> 00:06:29,247
Meet <i>Titanus mosura.</i>

84
00:06:29,249 --> 00:06:30,749
Or as we like to call her...

85
00:06:30,751 --> 00:06:32,184
Mothra.

86
00:06:32,186 --> 00:06:33,953
Incredible.

87
00:06:33,955 --> 00:06:36,523
<i>Activating containment grid.</i>

88
00:06:44,965 --> 00:06:46,434
- <i>Warning.</i>
- What's happening?

89
00:06:49,571 --> 00:06:50,903
<i>Warning.</i>

90
00:06:50,905 --> 00:06:52,372
Something's really wrong here.

91
00:06:52,374 --> 00:06:53,773
Containment systems
are failing.

92
00:06:53,775 --> 00:06:55,275
Perimeter alarms
are going off,

93
00:06:55,277 --> 00:06:56,708
the whole network's
going insane.

94
00:06:56,710 --> 00:06:58,311
What do you mean?
How is that possible?

95
00:06:58,313 --> 00:06:59,781
Emma, I think someone else
is doing this.

96
00:07:04,085 --> 00:07:05,751
<i>Containment team, stand down.</i>

97
00:07:05,753 --> 00:07:07,823
I repeat, stand down.
You are scaring her.

98
00:07:33,948 --> 00:07:35,514
No!

99
00:07:35,516 --> 00:07:36,482
Doctor Russell, I'm sorry.
But you know the protocols.

100
00:07:36,484 --> 00:07:37,751
We have to terminate!

101
00:07:37,753 --> 00:07:38,753
I'll handle this.

102
00:07:40,854 --> 00:07:41,955
Mom! No!

103
00:07:41,957 --> 00:07:43,926
Madison, stay here.
It's gonna work.

104
00:07:48,429 --> 00:07:49,898
<i>Stand clear.</i>

105
00:07:56,905 --> 00:07:58,707
It's okay.

106
00:08:36,677 --> 00:08:37,745
Mom!

107
00:08:44,219 --> 00:08:46,319
Mom!

108
00:08:46,321 --> 00:08:47,886
Maddie, wait!

109
00:08:47,888 --> 00:08:49,955
Maddie!

110
00:08:49,957 --> 00:08:51,292
Get back in here!

111
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,795
Maddie! Go back!

112
00:08:56,263 --> 00:08:57,499
Mom! Let's go!

113
00:09:00,668 --> 00:09:01,669
Mom!

114
00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:39,204
Son of a bitch.

115
00:09:39,206 --> 00:09:41,542
It worked.

116
00:10:37,865 --> 00:10:39,100
Mom?

117
00:10:53,447 --> 00:10:56,381
What we are witnessing here,
Senators,

118
00:10:56,383 --> 00:11:01,286
is the return of an ancient
and forgotten super species.

119
00:11:01,288 --> 00:11:04,891
Godzilla, the MUTOs, Kong.

120
00:11:04,893 --> 00:11:07,660
We believe that these "Titans"

121
00:11:07,662 --> 00:11:09,093
and others like them

122
00:11:09,095 --> 00:11:11,631
provide an essential balance
to our world.

123
00:11:11,633 --> 00:11:13,632
And while some may
pose a threat,

124
00:11:13,634 --> 00:11:17,002
Monarch is uniquely prepared
to determine

125
00:11:17,004 --> 00:11:19,771
which of these Titans are here
to threaten us

126
00:11:19,773 --> 00:11:22,875
and which of these Titans
are here to protect us.

127
00:11:22,877 --> 00:11:25,343
Thank you for the fifth grade
history lesson, Mr. Coleman.

128
00:11:25,345 --> 00:11:28,247
But we still haven't heard
one good reason

129
00:11:28,249 --> 00:11:31,250
why Monarch shouldn't fall
under military jurisdiction.

130
00:11:31,252 --> 00:11:34,285
Or why these creatures
shouldn't be exterminated.

131
00:11:34,287 --> 00:11:35,954
Monarch was tasked

132
00:11:35,956 --> 00:11:39,092
with finding and destroying
these radioactive monsters.

133
00:11:39,094 --> 00:11:41,327
But you either can't
or won't tell us

134
00:11:41,329 --> 00:11:44,897
how many there are
or why they're showing up.

135
00:11:44,899 --> 00:11:47,867
So, maybe it's time for
the military to put them down.

136
00:11:47,869 --> 00:11:49,934
Killing them
would be a mistake.

137
00:11:49,936 --> 00:11:52,104
They returned because of us.

138
00:11:52,106 --> 00:11:56,409
It was our atomic testing
that awoke <i>Gojira.</i>

139
00:11:56,411 --> 00:11:58,578
Other creatures like the MUTOs

140
00:11:58,580 --> 00:12:01,646
from strip mining
and seismic surveys.

141
00:12:01,648 --> 00:12:04,016
But these are not monsters.

142
00:12:04,018 --> 00:12:06,019
They are animals
rising to reclaim

143
00:12:06,021 --> 00:12:07,685
a world that was once theirs.

144
00:12:07,687 --> 00:12:09,054
It almost sounds like

145
00:12:09,056 --> 00:12:11,156
you're protecting them,
Doctor Serizawa.

146
00:12:11,158 --> 00:12:12,657
As if you admire them.

147
00:12:12,659 --> 00:12:15,761
I admire all forms of life.

148
00:12:15,763 --> 00:12:18,897
Senators,
if we hope to survive,

149
00:12:18,899 --> 00:12:22,601
we must find ways
to coexist with Titans.

150
00:12:22,603 --> 00:12:24,870
With <i>Gojira.</i>

151
00:12:24,872 --> 00:12:27,238
A sort of
symbiotic relationship,

152
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:29,341
if you will.

153
00:12:29,343 --> 00:12:30,977
Like the lion and the mouse.

154
00:12:30,979 --> 00:12:33,578
Or the scorpion and the frog.

155
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:36,314
So you'd want to
make Godzilla our pet?

156
00:12:36,316 --> 00:12:37,782
No.

157
00:12:37,784 --> 00:12:39,550
We will be his.

158
00:12:45,159 --> 00:12:46,925
Uh... No. No, actually.

159
00:12:46,927 --> 00:12:48,459
That's not what
Doctor Serizawa meant.

160
00:12:48,461 --> 00:12:49,694
We have to go.

161
00:12:49,696 --> 00:12:51,229
No one is implying
that we would be

162
00:12:51,231 --> 00:12:52,865
- Godzilla's or anyone's pet.
- Sam, we have to go.

163
00:12:52,867 --> 00:12:54,434
Doctor Serizawa,
Doctor Graham,

164
00:12:54,436 --> 00:12:55,767
this hearing is not adjourned.

165
00:12:55,769 --> 00:12:58,103
Doctor Serizawa,
I hope you understand

166
00:12:58,105 --> 00:13:01,806
the consequences
of walking out that door.

167
00:13:01,808 --> 00:13:03,108
Uh, you know what, Senators,

168
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:04,609
while I confer
with my colleagues here,

169
00:13:04,611 --> 00:13:06,011
I'm gonna set you up
with a very brief

170
00:13:06,013 --> 00:13:07,612
and pretty fun documentary

171
00:13:07,614 --> 00:13:09,348
on Titan reproduction.

172
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:11,150
I think this is the one where
the genitals are blurred out.

173
00:13:11,152 --> 00:13:14,786
But if not, you can leave
a comment with my assistant.

174
00:14:16,216 --> 00:14:18,449
The feed cuts out there.

175
00:14:18,451 --> 00:14:20,752
The survivors
haven't been able to give us

176
00:14:20,754 --> 00:14:23,088
much more
than what the footage allows.

177
00:14:23,090 --> 00:14:26,828
Only that Emma and Madison
were the only ones taken.

178
00:14:27,628 --> 00:14:29,194
I'm sorry, Mark.

179
00:14:29,196 --> 00:14:31,733
I should've been there
for her.

180
00:14:33,534 --> 00:14:34,699
Who are they?

181
00:14:34,701 --> 00:14:35,970
We don't know yet.

182
00:14:37,806 --> 00:14:40,307
We believe
they were after this.

183
00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:44,443
You didn't.

184
00:14:44,445 --> 00:14:45,910
It's the ORCA.

185
00:14:45,912 --> 00:14:47,512
Uh, that's why we think
they need Emma.

186
00:14:47,514 --> 00:14:50,049
She believed that
if we could somehow replicate

187
00:14:50,051 --> 00:14:52,083
the biosonar the Titans
use to communicate...

188
00:14:52,085 --> 00:14:54,254
I know what the hell it is.
I helped build the prototype.

189
00:14:55,523 --> 00:14:56,955
Who is he?

190
00:14:56,957 --> 00:14:59,290
Uh, Sam Coleman.
I'm the head of technology.

191
00:14:59,292 --> 00:15:01,961
I joined Monarch,
uh, shortly after you left.

192
00:15:01,963 --> 00:15:03,396
I'm a big fan of your wife...

193
00:15:03,398 --> 00:15:04,764
...'s work. And you.

194
00:15:04,766 --> 00:15:06,431
That just came out so weird,
I'm sorry.

195
00:15:06,433 --> 00:15:08,299
Emma and I destroyed
the prototype.

196
00:15:08,301 --> 00:15:11,237
And then Emma decided
to rebuild it.

197
00:15:11,239 --> 00:15:13,671
After San Francisco,
she went home to Boston,

198
00:15:13,673 --> 00:15:15,140
spent years developing it.

199
00:15:15,142 --> 00:15:16,541
She thought it could help...

200
00:15:16,543 --> 00:15:17,943
Would help what? Play God?

201
00:15:17,945 --> 00:15:19,978
No.
Help prevent another attack.

202
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:21,545
ORCA was a grad school
science project.

203
00:15:21,547 --> 00:15:23,649
It was meant to keep whales
away from the shoreline.

204
00:15:23,651 --> 00:15:25,883
Not so you could talk to your
little creatures out there.

205
00:15:25,885 --> 00:15:29,054
Listen to me, they'll think
it's one of them.

206
00:15:29,056 --> 00:15:32,024
You use the wrong frequency
on one of 'em

207
00:15:32,026 --> 00:15:33,858
and you're
gonna be responsible

208
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:35,828
for 1,000 San Franciscos.

209
00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:38,264
Which is why we need
to get it back.

210
00:15:38,266 --> 00:15:41,833
Emma always said no one knew
the ORCA better than you.

211
00:15:41,835 --> 00:15:44,035
It shouldn't even exist.

212
00:15:44,037 --> 00:15:45,404
That may be, Mark.

213
00:15:45,406 --> 00:15:47,338
But it's fallen
into the wrong hands.

214
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:49,876
And right now,
the ORCA is the only thing

215
00:15:49,878 --> 00:15:52,612
keeping
Emma and Madison alive.

216
00:15:52,614 --> 00:15:54,613
Mark, we know you're hurting.

217
00:15:54,615 --> 00:15:58,152
But if we find the ORCA,
we'll find your family.

218
00:15:59,486 --> 00:16:01,155
I promise.

219
00:16:10,398 --> 00:16:11,697
<i>When was the last time</i>

220
00:16:11,699 --> 00:16:12,901
<i>you spoke to Emma?</i>

221
00:16:13,801 --> 00:16:15,470
About three years ago.

222
00:16:16,537 --> 00:16:18,002
After San Francisco,

223
00:16:18,004 --> 00:16:20,008
we went back home to Boston.

224
00:16:22,109 --> 00:16:24,642
Tried to put
the pieces back together.

225
00:16:24,644 --> 00:16:28,881
Emma dealt with it by doubling
down on saving the world

226
00:16:28,883 --> 00:16:30,785
and I started drinking.

227
00:16:32,519 --> 00:16:34,987
I can't tell you
how much I hated myself

228
00:16:34,989 --> 00:16:37,358
for letting Maddie see me
that way.

229
00:16:39,793 --> 00:16:41,260
Uh, you mind
if we cut in here?

230
00:16:41,262 --> 00:16:44,465
It's just,
you're gonna wanna see this.

231
00:16:45,899 --> 00:16:48,032
Emma combined the bioacoustics

232
00:16:48,034 --> 00:16:51,270
of different Titans
to create the ORCA's signal.

233
00:16:51,272 --> 00:16:53,104
A sort of baseline frequency

234
00:16:53,106 --> 00:16:55,174
that all the creatures
respond to.

235
00:16:55,176 --> 00:16:57,142
Attracting them,
repelling them,

236
00:16:57,144 --> 00:17:00,111
even at times
calming them down.

237
00:17:00,113 --> 00:17:02,114
It's pretty remarkable
actually.

238
00:17:02,116 --> 00:17:03,214
The problem is
we don't know

239
00:17:03,216 --> 00:17:04,649
which Titans she combined.

240
00:17:04,651 --> 00:17:07,185
But if you can identify
those frequencies,

241
00:17:07,187 --> 00:17:09,655
we'll be able
to track the ORCA

242
00:17:09,657 --> 00:17:11,924
and find Emma and Madison.

243
00:17:11,926 --> 00:17:13,992
Jesus!

244
00:17:13,994 --> 00:17:15,927
How many of these things
are there?

245
00:17:15,929 --> 00:17:19,264
Seventeen and counting
after <i>Gojira.</i>

246
00:17:19,266 --> 00:17:20,598
Seventeen?

247
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:22,200
Most of them were discovered
in deep hibernation.

248
00:17:22,202 --> 00:17:24,470
While others we've contained

249
00:17:24,472 --> 00:17:26,071
at top secret sites
around the globe.

250
00:17:26,073 --> 00:17:29,040
Cambodia, Mexico,
Skull Island.

251
00:17:29,042 --> 00:17:31,476
We even found one in Wyoming.

252
00:17:31,478 --> 00:17:32,744
They're everywhere.

253
00:17:32,746 --> 00:17:33,979
Why don't you kill 'em?

254
00:17:33,981 --> 00:17:35,713
The government wants to.

255
00:17:35,715 --> 00:17:40,287
But Emma and I believe
some are benevolent.

256
00:17:42,723 --> 00:17:44,259
Don't kid yourself.

257
00:17:46,927 --> 00:17:49,296
Uh... Hey, look at that.
We're here.

258
00:17:59,873 --> 00:18:01,405
<i>Castle Bravo,</i>

259
00:18:01,407 --> 00:18:03,343
<i>this is Raptor One.
On direct approach.</i>

260
00:18:09,148 --> 00:18:11,049
<i>Raptor One,
you are cleared</i>

261
00:18:11,051 --> 00:18:13,353
<i>for assisted descent
to pad four.</i>

262
00:18:22,361 --> 00:18:24,163
<i>Sensors set
for three meters.</i>

263
00:18:24,165 --> 00:18:25,567
<i>Beginning sub-surface descent.</i>

264
00:18:28,601 --> 00:18:31,002
This is new.

265
00:18:31,004 --> 00:18:33,004
Yeah, we call it Castle Bravo.

266
00:18:33,006 --> 00:18:34,839
Our new flagship facility

267
00:18:34,841 --> 00:18:38,210
built to track and study
Godzilla on his own turf.

268
00:18:38,212 --> 00:18:40,044
I thought he was missing.

269
00:18:40,046 --> 00:18:42,583
Well, only if you don't know
where to look.

270
00:18:52,626 --> 00:18:55,961
As you know,
at approximately 0700 hours,

271
00:18:55,963 --> 00:18:58,097
our containment site

272
00:18:58,099 --> 00:19:00,098
in China's Yunnan Rainforest
was raided.

273
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:03,536
The specimen,
code name Mothra, escaped.

274
00:19:03,538 --> 00:19:07,905
Only to cocoon itself later
under a nearby waterfall.

275
00:19:07,907 --> 00:19:09,308
While Doctor Emma Russell

276
00:19:09,310 --> 00:19:11,476
and her daughter Madison
were taken hostage.

277
00:19:11,478 --> 00:19:15,513
This is the man responsible,
Alan Jonah.

278
00:19:15,515 --> 00:19:18,651
A former British army colonel
turned ecoterrorist.

279
00:19:18,653 --> 00:19:21,819
Obsessed with restoring
natural order.

280
00:19:21,821 --> 00:19:23,388
And to fund his operations,

281
00:19:23,390 --> 00:19:26,625
he began trafficking
in a new and dangerous market.

282
00:19:26,627 --> 00:19:28,393
Titan DNA.

283
00:19:28,395 --> 00:19:30,361
What the hell is someone gonna
do with a giant worm?

284
00:19:30,363 --> 00:19:31,963
Are you kidding,
Martinez?

285
00:19:31,965 --> 00:19:33,432
What can't you do with it?

286
00:19:33,434 --> 00:19:35,501
Pharmaceuticals,
bioweapons, food...

287
00:19:35,503 --> 00:19:38,604
Hell, there isn't a country
or a company on the planet

288
00:19:38,606 --> 00:19:40,504
that doesn't wanna get its
hands on one of these suckers.

289
00:19:40,506 --> 00:19:43,742
And remember,
this is just a larva.

290
00:19:43,744 --> 00:19:44,976
That's a baby.

291
00:19:44,978 --> 00:19:47,011
After it cocoons,

292
00:19:47,013 --> 00:19:48,413
something else
is gonna crawl out.

293
00:19:48,415 --> 00:19:51,183
Something bigger, meaner...

294
00:19:51,185 --> 00:19:52,885
- We don't know that, Rick.
- Oh, yeah?

295
00:19:52,887 --> 00:19:54,921
Just wait for it, Chen.

296
00:19:54,923 --> 00:19:57,356
Our intel indicates
that Jonah wants

297
00:19:57,358 --> 00:19:58,790
to capture this specimen.

298
00:19:58,792 --> 00:20:00,358
Alive.

299
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:02,528
Which means that he and his
mercs won't be far behind.

300
00:20:02,530 --> 00:20:05,896
At 0500, we'll ship out
to launch a joint operation...

301
00:20:05,898 --> 00:20:07,433
I wouldn't bother.

302
00:20:07,435 --> 00:20:08,567
Excuse me?

303
00:20:08,569 --> 00:20:10,269
Sounds like
a duck hunt to me.

304
00:20:10,271 --> 00:20:11,802
Uh, Mark, why don't we let
Colonel Foster finish...

305
00:20:11,804 --> 00:20:14,339
A decoy. A diversion.

306
00:20:14,341 --> 00:20:16,107
Look, they've already got Emma
and the ORCA.

307
00:20:16,109 --> 00:20:18,476
Why would they want just this
one when they've got the keys

308
00:20:18,478 --> 00:20:22,013
to your entire magic kingdom
of horrors back here?

309
00:20:22,015 --> 00:20:24,683
I think that they want you
to go after this Mothra

310
00:20:24,685 --> 00:20:26,918
so they can go
after a real prize.

311
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:28,753
Something bigger.

312
00:20:28,755 --> 00:20:30,454
Right.

313
00:20:30,456 --> 00:20:31,591
Mark,

314
00:20:32,724 --> 00:20:34,092
this is not the first specimen
they've captured.

315
00:20:34,094 --> 00:20:35,327
They know what they are doing.

316
00:20:35,329 --> 00:20:36,761
That's not
just a specimen.

317
00:20:36,763 --> 00:20:38,396
I've got an ex-wife
and a daughter out there,

318
00:20:38,398 --> 00:20:39,731
in case you forgot.

319
00:20:39,733 --> 00:20:42,134
No. No one has
forgotten that, Mark,

320
00:20:42,136 --> 00:20:43,335
but, uh, to remind you,

321
00:20:43,337 --> 00:20:44,769
you were brought on here

322
00:20:44,771 --> 00:20:46,404
to help track the ORCA,
and to advise us...

323
00:20:46,406 --> 00:20:49,808
I advise you to kill
these things. All of 'em.

324
00:20:49,810 --> 00:20:51,444
Especially him.

325
00:20:51,446 --> 00:20:52,712
You wanna make sure
these things

326
00:20:52,714 --> 00:20:54,280
don't fall
into the wrong hands?

327
00:20:54,282 --> 00:20:56,114
You kill them
and the ORCA's useless.

328
00:20:56,116 --> 00:20:58,783
Emma wouldn't have
wanted that.

329
00:20:58,785 --> 00:21:00,219
Even to save her life.

330
00:21:00,221 --> 00:21:01,552
Well, it wouldn't be
the first time

331
00:21:01,554 --> 00:21:03,688
Emma put all of this
before herself

332
00:21:03,690 --> 00:21:05,759
or her family, would it?

333
00:21:10,731 --> 00:21:12,764
Dude hates Titans.

334
00:21:12,766 --> 00:21:15,102
Yeah, well, you would too,
if you were him.

335
00:21:20,507 --> 00:21:22,607
<i>Outpost 32,
this is Raptor Five,</i>

336
00:21:22,609 --> 00:21:24,542
<i>on approach with
reinforcements and supplies.</i>

337
00:21:24,544 --> 00:21:26,212
<i>Requesting permission to land.</i>

338
00:21:26,214 --> 00:21:28,646
<i>Serizawa has all sites
on high alert,</i>

339
00:21:28,648 --> 00:21:31,049
<i>so transmitting
emergency codes now.</i>

340
00:21:31,051 --> 00:21:33,350
<i>Copy that, Raptor Five.</i>

341
00:21:33,352 --> 00:21:35,523
<i>Codes are good.
Nice to have you back.</i>

342
00:21:42,629 --> 00:21:43,630
Go.

343
00:21:50,236 --> 00:21:51,604
It's good to see ya.

344
00:21:51,606 --> 00:21:53,541
- Need a hand with offload?
- No, we're good!

345
00:21:57,311 --> 00:21:58,909
We're gonna put it
over at bay five.

346
00:21:58,911 --> 00:22:01,480
- Follow me!
- Go back up! Hey, hey!

347
00:22:01,482 --> 00:22:03,651
Leave them, let's go!

348
00:22:11,358 --> 00:22:12,890
I'm scared.

349
00:22:12,892 --> 00:22:14,628
I know. Me, too.

350
00:22:19,065 --> 00:22:20,999
Okay.

351
00:22:21,001 --> 00:22:23,402
Let's go.

352
00:22:32,913 --> 00:22:34,348
Eyes straight ahead.

353
00:22:35,782 --> 00:22:37,215
Deep breaths.

354
00:22:37,217 --> 00:22:38,753
Just like we talked about.

355
00:23:05,612 --> 00:23:07,114
Hmm.

356
00:23:19,092 --> 00:23:21,426
Mother of God.

357
00:23:21,428 --> 00:23:24,131
She had nothing to do
with this.

358
00:23:32,706 --> 00:23:34,441
Monster Zero.

359
00:23:57,296 --> 00:23:58,931
Any survivors?

360
00:23:58,933 --> 00:24:01,398
No. They tried to
launch an emergency beacon,

361
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:02,901
but we cut them off in time.

362
00:24:02,903 --> 00:24:04,502
They'll figure it out.

363
00:24:04,504 --> 00:24:06,437
Fire up the drills.

364
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,476
Do you have
everything you need?

365
00:24:10,676 --> 00:24:12,043
Good.

366
00:24:12,045 --> 00:24:13,713
Well, let's get started.

367
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:15,649
Further.

368
00:24:39,639 --> 00:24:43,508
<i>We have a grizzly situation
up here in the attic.</i>

369
00:24:43,510 --> 00:24:44,909
<i>Come on, Andrew.
Andrew.</i>

370
00:24:44,911 --> 00:24:46,511
<i>I've come to eat
your horses.</i>

371
00:24:46,513 --> 00:24:48,011
<i>No, you can't eat
my horses...</i>

372
00:24:48,013 --> 00:24:49,317
<i>That's not...</i>

373
00:24:49,882 --> 00:24:50,915
<i>Stop.</i>

374
00:24:50,917 --> 00:24:52,117
<i>Look.</i>

375
00:24:52,119 --> 00:24:54,152
- <i>An intruder! Get her!</i>
- <i>Get her!</i>

376
00:24:54,154 --> 00:24:56,488
- <i>Get her! Get her!</i>
- <i>No, don't get me!</i>

377
00:24:56,490 --> 00:24:58,623
<i>Andrew, Madison!
Get her!</i>

378
00:24:58,625 --> 00:25:00,559
- <i>Get her!</i>
- <i>Bear kisses.</i>

379
00:25:03,096 --> 00:25:04,829
<i>Bear kisses!</i>

380
00:25:12,505 --> 00:25:17,174
<i>All personnel, report
to battle stations. Code red.</i>

381
00:25:17,176 --> 00:25:19,877
<i>All personnel,
report to battle stations.</i>

382
00:25:19,879 --> 00:25:22,013
- <i>Code red.</i>
- At least 60 knots.

383
00:25:22,015 --> 00:25:23,548
<i>This is not a drill.</i>

384
00:25:23,550 --> 00:25:25,482
<i>All personnel,
report to battle stations.</i>

385
00:25:25,484 --> 00:25:27,321
<i>Code red.</i>

386
00:25:29,924 --> 00:25:31,155
What's happening?

387
00:25:31,157 --> 00:25:32,456
Something's wrong.

388
00:25:32,458 --> 00:25:34,358
He's never been
this close before.

389
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:36,328
- Who's he?
- Who do you think?

390
00:25:38,098 --> 00:25:40,799
He's taking out
our observation drones.

391
00:25:40,801 --> 00:25:41,966
Trajectory?

392
00:25:41,968 --> 00:25:45,103
Straight at us!
1,200 meters and closing.

393
00:25:45,105 --> 00:25:47,438
G-Team. Barnes,
Martinez, Hendricks,

394
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,840
I want you on those CROWS now!

395
00:25:48,842 --> 00:25:51,044
You heard boss lady!
Let's move!

396
00:26:00,987 --> 00:26:03,488
Doctor Stanton.
Do you have his bioacoustics?

397
00:26:03,490 --> 00:26:05,190
Acoustics coming up!

398
00:26:06,592 --> 00:26:08,793
Okay, he's closing.
We're at 800 meters!

399
00:26:08,795 --> 00:26:10,428
Its movements are erratic.

400
00:26:10,430 --> 00:26:11,996
Heart and breathing elevated.

401
00:26:11,998 --> 00:26:14,465
Yeah, he's definitely
not happy about something.

402
00:26:14,467 --> 00:26:15,966
How are they getting all this?

403
00:26:15,968 --> 00:26:18,571
Emma isolated
Godzilla's bioacoustics.

404
00:26:19,439 --> 00:26:21,406
It allows us to track him.

405
00:26:21,408 --> 00:26:23,040
Even to get his vitals.

406
00:26:26,813 --> 00:26:29,213
Circling now,
closing in, 200 meters.

407
00:26:29,215 --> 00:26:30,648
Colonel!

408
00:26:30,650 --> 00:26:32,416
All teams in position,
weapons hot,

409
00:26:32,418 --> 00:26:33,853
ready to engage on my command.

410
00:26:36,122 --> 00:26:37,524
Come on, come on, come on.

411
00:26:38,190 --> 00:26:39,523
Hold your fire.

412
00:26:39,525 --> 00:26:41,126
We don't know he'll attack.

413
00:26:41,128 --> 00:26:43,729
He will if you keep
those guns on him.

414
00:26:43,731 --> 00:26:45,463
Now I want him dead
more than anybody,

415
00:26:45,465 --> 00:26:47,764
but unless this is a fight
that you know that you can win,

416
00:26:47,766 --> 00:26:49,003
for God's sake, stand down.

417
00:26:56,376 --> 00:26:57,809
Stand down.

418
00:26:57,811 --> 00:26:59,309
You can't be serious.

419
00:26:59,311 --> 00:27:00,680
I am.

420
00:27:01,481 --> 00:27:03,117
Stand down.

421
00:27:05,218 --> 00:27:06,483
Stand down.

422
00:27:06,485 --> 00:27:07,685
I say again,
safe your weapons.

423
00:27:07,687 --> 00:27:08,988
Do not engage.

424
00:27:13,561 --> 00:27:14,762
Listen.

425
00:27:16,496 --> 00:27:19,432
His heart rate, it's slowing.

426
00:27:26,407 --> 00:27:29,040
Open the shields.

427
00:27:29,042 --> 00:27:30,975
Oh, yeah, sure.
Let's bring him in for a beer.

428
00:27:30,977 --> 00:27:33,611
You out of your goddamn mind?

429
00:27:33,613 --> 00:27:35,482
Let him know
we're not a threat.

430
00:27:36,649 --> 00:27:38,386
Open the shields.

431
00:27:43,956 --> 00:27:44,958
Do it.

432
00:28:19,525 --> 00:28:21,827
Hey, what's with
the light show?

433
00:28:21,829 --> 00:28:24,896
It's an intimidation display.

434
00:28:24,898 --> 00:28:27,531
Like a gorilla
pounding his chest.

435
00:28:27,533 --> 00:28:29,567
Consider us very

436
00:28:29,569 --> 00:28:31,105
intimidated.

437
00:28:32,773 --> 00:28:34,975
I don't think it's for us.

438
00:28:43,617 --> 00:28:45,152
What are you doing, dude?

439
00:29:13,179 --> 00:29:14,681
Well,
that was interesting.

440
00:29:15,948 --> 00:29:16,950
Jesus!

441
00:29:26,726 --> 00:29:28,896
Can we maybe
close the shield now?

442
00:29:30,030 --> 00:29:32,629
Show me
his territorial routes.

443
00:29:32,631 --> 00:29:34,165
What? Why?

444
00:29:34,167 --> 00:29:36,067
Because I wanna start
a boat tour. Just show me.

445
00:29:36,069 --> 00:29:38,235
Okay. Coming up.

446
00:29:38,237 --> 00:29:40,271
You care to tell us
what you're looking for?

447
00:29:40,273 --> 00:29:42,206
When an animal leaves
its hunting ground,

448
00:29:42,208 --> 00:29:44,242
it's usually because
it's threatened by something.

449
00:29:44,244 --> 00:29:45,711
Run a course projection.

450
00:29:45,713 --> 00:29:47,211
We gotta go after him.

451
00:29:47,213 --> 00:29:49,282
He's looking for something
out there.

452
00:29:50,250 --> 00:29:51,685
It could be the ORCA.

453
00:29:54,253 --> 00:29:56,988
Doctor Stanton,
what's your projection?

454
00:29:56,990 --> 00:30:00,060
All paths have him
landing in the same place.

455
00:30:01,794 --> 00:30:03,060
Antarctica.

456
00:30:03,062 --> 00:30:04,428
Good, then.

457
00:30:04,430 --> 00:30:07,167
I mean, let's go!
Let's go find him. Let's...

458
00:30:08,501 --> 00:30:11,469
Wait, what's in Antarctica?

459
00:30:11,471 --> 00:30:12,569
Barnes,

460
00:30:12,571 --> 00:30:14,771
contact the <i>Argo.</i>

461
00:30:14,773 --> 00:30:16,010
Yes, ma'am.

462
00:30:27,253 --> 00:30:29,320
<i>The specimen at this site</i>

463
00:30:29,322 --> 00:30:31,222
has been kept
entirely off-book.

464
00:30:31,224 --> 00:30:33,524
And since it's
a more recent discovery,

465
00:30:33,526 --> 00:30:35,793
our data is limited.

466
00:30:35,795 --> 00:30:38,529
But it seems to be
another apex predator.

467
00:30:38,531 --> 00:30:41,098
Emma called it Monster Zero.

468
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:43,467
It may have been
a rival alpha to Godzilla.

469
00:30:43,469 --> 00:30:46,303
Battling for dominance
over the other Titans.

470
00:30:46,305 --> 00:30:47,772
Doctor Chen?

471
00:30:47,774 --> 00:30:50,340
I've been scouring through
thousands of years

472
00:30:50,342 --> 00:30:51,876
of myths and legends.

473
00:30:51,878 --> 00:30:54,479
But it's almost as if
people were scared

474
00:30:54,481 --> 00:30:56,047
to even write about it.

475
00:30:56,049 --> 00:30:58,648
As if it was meant
to be forgotten.

476
00:30:58,650 --> 00:30:59,850
Sorry, I hate to crash
a party,

477
00:30:59,852 --> 00:31:01,118
but I got some bad news.

478
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,753
You could just say news.
It's always bad.

479
00:31:02,755 --> 00:31:04,155
We lost Godzilla.

480
00:31:04,157 --> 00:31:06,190
He dropped off the scan
near Venezuela.

481
00:31:06,192 --> 00:31:07,291
Dropped off?

482
00:31:07,293 --> 00:31:08,626
I'm telling you,
Doctor Brooks was right.

483
00:31:08,628 --> 00:31:09,927
It's a Hollow Earth.

484
00:31:09,929 --> 00:31:11,829
That's how he moves around
so fast

485
00:31:11,831 --> 00:31:15,000
using these underwater tunnels
like wormholes.

486
00:31:15,002 --> 00:31:16,934
Just zippin' around.

487
00:31:16,936 --> 00:31:18,536
Everyone look sharp.

488
00:31:18,538 --> 00:31:20,374
We're approaching the base.

489
00:31:30,282 --> 00:31:33,184
- They're here.
- Keep 'em busy.

490
00:31:33,186 --> 00:31:35,252
Launch reaction force.
Move out!

491
00:31:35,254 --> 00:31:37,291
All right, gents!
Got the green light!

492
00:31:58,244 --> 00:31:59,511
If Jonah is looking

493
00:31:59,513 --> 00:32:00,845
to extract genetic samples

494
00:32:00,847 --> 00:32:03,682
they'll be here
in the bio labs.

495
00:32:03,684 --> 00:32:05,183
All right, two minutes!

496
00:32:05,185 --> 00:32:07,186
Check your equipment,
stand by the door.

497
00:32:25,638 --> 00:32:27,907
Come on, Ash.
Make it snappy.

498
00:32:29,743 --> 00:32:31,709
- Detonator ready.
- Let's go.

499
00:32:31,711 --> 00:32:33,043
Come on, Maddie.

500
00:32:33,045 --> 00:32:34,247
Move! Move!

501
00:32:52,365 --> 00:32:55,135
Remember, eyes wide.
We got friendlies in here.

502
00:32:57,337 --> 00:32:59,103
<i>Move to tunnel two.</i>

503
00:32:59,105 --> 00:33:00,771
<i>Stay on overwatch.</i>

504
00:33:00,773 --> 00:33:02,141
<i>Roger that, Chief.</i>

505
00:33:20,194 --> 00:33:21,893
<i>Ambush! Ambush!</i>

506
00:33:26,131 --> 00:33:28,232
Team under fire! 360 ambush!

507
00:33:28,234 --> 00:33:30,003
<i>We're taking heavy losses.</i>

508
00:33:30,669 --> 00:33:31,904
Break right!

509
00:33:34,174 --> 00:33:35,473
<i>Hold your fire!
Hold your fire!</i>

510
00:33:35,475 --> 00:33:36,540
<i>We got friendlies!</i>

511
00:33:36,542 --> 00:33:37,744
<i>No!</i>

512
00:33:38,578 --> 00:33:39,780
Mark?

513
00:33:41,613 --> 00:33:43,614
Get down there and help
Barnes. I'm going after him.

514
00:33:43,616 --> 00:33:44,818
Roger that.

515
00:33:57,965 --> 00:34:01,901
Hey, guys.
I'm getting an EKG reading.

516
00:34:06,706 --> 00:34:08,639
Emma?

517
00:34:08,641 --> 00:34:10,174
Maddie!

518
00:34:10,176 --> 00:34:11,811
Number one, let's go.

519
00:34:18,150 --> 00:34:19,817
Barnes, this is Foster.

520
00:34:19,819 --> 00:34:23,791
I've got eyes on the target.
Repeat, eyes on the target.

521
00:34:29,362 --> 00:34:30,497
Let 'em go!

522
00:34:33,098 --> 00:34:35,034
- Ash!
- Dad!

523
00:34:36,936 --> 00:34:39,737
- Mark.
- Emma, Madison, let's go.

524
00:34:39,739 --> 00:34:40,938
Dad.

525
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:42,306
Let's go.

526
00:34:42,308 --> 00:34:43,474
- Emma, Maddie, come on.
- Daddy?

527
00:34:43,476 --> 00:34:45,110
Madison, walk to me.

528
00:34:45,112 --> 00:34:47,744
Walk to me now.
Come on, honey.

529
00:34:47,746 --> 00:34:49,679
Barnes, I've got two hostages,
one target down.

530
00:34:49,681 --> 00:34:51,815
- Now! Come on, Maddie.
- <i>I do not have a shot.</i>

531
00:34:51,817 --> 00:34:53,217
<i>Repeat, I do not have a shot.</i>

532
00:34:53,219 --> 00:34:54,918
Emma, what are you doing?
Let's go. Come on!

533
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:56,422
- Dad.
- Maddie.

534
00:34:57,623 --> 00:34:58,826
Dad.

535
00:35:01,627 --> 00:35:02,995
Madison.

536
00:35:29,089 --> 00:35:30,623
What the hell?

537
00:35:38,998 --> 00:35:40,367
I'm sorry.

538
00:35:42,902 --> 00:35:44,469
Run.

539
00:35:59,185 --> 00:36:00,386
Maddie!

540
00:36:01,822 --> 00:36:03,023
Dad!

541
00:36:05,424 --> 00:36:06,426
Move, move!

542
00:36:22,741 --> 00:36:25,044
- Foster!
- Get out of the way!

543
00:36:26,212 --> 00:36:27,645
- Let's go!
- Hang on! Move!

544
00:36:27,647 --> 00:36:29,313
Hendricks, on the double!

545
00:36:29,315 --> 00:36:30,984
- I got you, Colonel!
- Get her legs!

546
00:36:32,884 --> 00:36:34,186
We gotta go!

547
00:36:39,726 --> 00:36:40,928
Damn it!

548
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,701
Martinez, Foster, let's go!

549
00:36:50,703 --> 00:36:52,038
Move, move! Come on!

550
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:57,143
Come on, let's go!
Strap in!

551
00:36:58,744 --> 00:37:01,045
No checklist this time.
Check clearance right.

552
00:37:01,047 --> 00:37:02,480
Clear right.

553
00:37:02,482 --> 00:37:04,181
- What is Dad doing here?
- I don't know, honey.

554
00:37:04,183 --> 00:37:06,152
Let's go.

555
00:37:08,388 --> 00:37:09,954
We can't leave him.

556
00:37:09,956 --> 00:37:11,188
What are you
waiting for?

557
00:37:11,190 --> 00:37:12,693
Wake it up.

558
00:37:27,072 --> 00:37:28,641
Let's go! Move it!

559
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:56,128
You gotta be fucking kidding.

560
00:39:08,540 --> 00:39:10,608
Fall back! Fall back!

561
00:39:10,610 --> 00:39:13,613
Get to the chopper!

562
00:39:14,380 --> 00:39:15,549
Go, go, go!

563
00:39:26,058 --> 00:39:27,526
Open fire!

564
00:39:37,203 --> 00:39:40,270
We'll do an emergency
vertical take-off at max RPM.

565
00:39:40,272 --> 00:39:41,574
Number two's
still speeding up.

566
00:39:55,186 --> 00:39:56,788
Oh, shit.

567
00:40:20,545 --> 00:40:22,313
This is Raptor One to <i>Argo.</i>

568
00:40:22,315 --> 00:40:24,380
Requesting immediate
urgent extract.

569
00:40:24,382 --> 00:40:26,250
Again, I say urgent extract.

570
00:40:26,252 --> 00:40:27,453
Griffin, get us the hell
out of here!

571
00:40:30,156 --> 00:40:31,755
Madison!

572
00:40:31,757 --> 00:40:32,889
Madison, no!

573
00:40:42,302 --> 00:40:44,302
- You need to let go of it!
- No! No! No!

574
00:40:44,304 --> 00:40:46,204
- Madison!
- Maddie! Let go!

575
00:40:46,206 --> 00:40:47,707
No!

576
00:41:19,072 --> 00:41:21,304
<i>Argo,</i> this is
Raptor One. We've been hit.

577
00:41:21,306 --> 00:41:22,676
All systems are down.

578
00:41:25,277 --> 00:41:26,612
Look out!

579
00:42:47,125 --> 00:42:48,761
Everybody, hold on!

580
00:43:09,447 --> 00:43:10,650
Mark!

581
00:43:14,020 --> 00:43:16,585
Everybody,
clear out. Let's go!

582
00:43:16,587 --> 00:43:17,922
Go! Go!

583
00:43:17,924 --> 00:43:19,626
- Mark!
- I'm stuck.

584
00:43:37,610 --> 00:43:38,808
Are you all right?

585
00:43:38,810 --> 00:43:40,846
Got it!
I got it. Go, go!

586
00:45:31,556 --> 00:45:33,023
Anything on the satellites?

587
00:45:33,025 --> 00:45:34,925
Subs have Godzilla hauling ass
off Argentina.

588
00:45:34,927 --> 00:45:38,195
We lost Monster Zero in
a tropical storm over Brazil.

589
00:45:38,197 --> 00:45:40,364
Scanning the entire
Southern Hemisphere.

590
00:45:40,366 --> 00:45:41,599
So far, nothing.

591
00:45:41,601 --> 00:45:42,833
Then scan the Northern.

592
00:45:42,835 --> 00:45:44,067
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

593
00:45:44,069 --> 00:45:45,668
I know what I saw, Sam.

594
00:45:45,670 --> 00:45:47,904
And I'm telling you,
she pulled that trigger.

595
00:45:47,906 --> 00:45:49,739
All due respect, Colonel,
you saw wrong.

596
00:45:49,741 --> 00:45:51,407
Okay? She wouldn't
have done it.

597
00:45:51,409 --> 00:45:53,811
Christ, she recruited pretty
much everyone in this room.

598
00:45:53,813 --> 00:45:55,945
Maybe Jonah forced her, right?

599
00:45:55,947 --> 00:45:57,882
Maybe he used Madison
as leverage.

600
00:45:57,884 --> 00:45:59,483
No, no. It had to be
someone else.

601
00:45:59,485 --> 00:46:00,687
Emma.

602
00:46:03,121 --> 00:46:04,790
It was Emma.

603
00:46:05,657 --> 00:46:08,224
Foster saw it right.

604
00:46:08,226 --> 00:46:10,094
It was her.
No one forced her to.

605
00:46:10,096 --> 00:46:11,264
Are you sure?

606
00:46:13,031 --> 00:46:15,199
First, she releases Mothra.

607
00:46:15,201 --> 00:46:16,900
And now Monster Zero.

608
00:46:16,902 --> 00:46:20,070
Anyone else sensing
a pattern here?

609
00:46:20,072 --> 00:46:21,771
Yes,
and not a good one.

610
00:46:21,773 --> 00:46:23,873
It's as if she is trying
to start a mass awakening.

611
00:46:23,875 --> 00:46:26,210
Well, it's just too bad
that no one tried

612
00:46:26,212 --> 00:46:27,878
to warn you that
that was gonna happen.

613
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:29,346
Hang on, guys.

614
00:46:29,348 --> 00:46:31,549
Why the hell would she
want to release them?

615
00:46:31,551 --> 00:46:33,183
And why would she
team up with Jonah,

616
00:46:33,185 --> 00:46:35,186
of all people, to do it?

617
00:46:35,188 --> 00:46:36,286
We'll ask her

618
00:46:36,288 --> 00:46:38,190
when we find her.

619
00:46:39,324 --> 00:46:42,661
So, let's keep looking.

620
00:46:57,043 --> 00:46:58,875
<i>Godzilla
appears to be following</i>

621
00:46:58,877 --> 00:47:00,476
the same path
as Emma's osprey,

622
00:47:00,478 --> 00:47:03,246
heading north
over South America to here.

623
00:47:03,248 --> 00:47:05,983
Outpost 56 in Isla de Mara,
Mexico.

624
00:47:05,985 --> 00:47:08,152
We touch down there
in ten minutes.

625
00:47:08,154 --> 00:47:09,520
What about the people?

626
00:47:09,522 --> 00:47:11,054
I'm sorry?

627
00:47:11,056 --> 00:47:13,657
The people. The people
down there in that village

628
00:47:13,659 --> 00:47:15,293
that don't realize
they're gonna be

629
00:47:15,295 --> 00:47:16,661
the special of the day.

630
00:47:16,663 --> 00:47:18,561
We've sent G-Team
to begin an evacuation.

631
00:47:18,563 --> 00:47:19,862
Doctor Serizawa,

632
00:47:19,864 --> 00:47:21,431
we have a call
on the emergency channel

633
00:47:21,433 --> 00:47:22,532
from Isla de Mara.

634
00:47:22,534 --> 00:47:23,969
Answer it.

635
00:47:32,143 --> 00:47:33,610
<i>I suppose I should go first.</i>

636
00:47:33,612 --> 00:47:35,545
Where's Madison?

637
00:47:35,547 --> 00:47:37,848
- <i>She's right here with me.</i>
- <i>Dad, are you okay?</i>

638
00:47:37,850 --> 00:47:40,183
Madison, you all right, hon?

639
00:47:40,185 --> 00:47:41,186
<i>Dad...</i>

640
00:47:42,522 --> 00:47:44,654
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

641
00:47:44,656 --> 00:47:45,855
You don't need to be...

642
00:47:45,857 --> 00:47:47,224
<i>It's okay. It's okay.</i>

643
00:47:47,226 --> 00:47:48,491
<i>I'm sorry, Dad.</i>

644
00:47:48,493 --> 00:47:50,092
She's fine, Mark, trust me.

645
00:47:50,094 --> 00:47:51,594
<i>Trust is a little hard</i>

646
00:47:51,596 --> 00:47:52,929
<i>to come by, Doctor Russell.</i>

647
00:47:52,931 --> 00:47:54,530
Especially after
what you pulled.

648
00:47:54,532 --> 00:47:56,000
<i>I know.</i>

649
00:47:56,002 --> 00:48:00,503
And I can only imagine
what you're all thinking.

650
00:48:00,505 --> 00:48:04,308
<i>But if there were any other
way to do this, I would.</i>

651
00:48:04,310 --> 00:48:05,945
Do what, Emma?

652
00:48:06,811 --> 00:48:08,445
<i>I'm saving the world.</i>

653
00:48:08,447 --> 00:48:11,114
But by releasing those things?
That doesn't make sense.

654
00:48:11,116 --> 00:48:14,550
<i>As impossible
as it seems, it does.</i>

655
00:48:14,552 --> 00:48:16,520
<i>Hear me out, Mark.</i>

656
00:48:16,522 --> 00:48:18,221
<i>After we lost Andrew,</i>

657
00:48:18,223 --> 00:48:21,157
<i>I swore his death
would not be in vain.</i>

658
00:48:21,159 --> 00:48:23,527
<i>That I would find an answer.</i>

659
00:48:23,529 --> 00:48:25,895
<i>A solution to why
the Titans were rising.</i>

660
00:48:25,897 --> 00:48:27,429
<i>But as I dug deeper,</i>

661
00:48:27,431 --> 00:48:31,701
<i>I realized that
they were here for a reason.</i>

662
00:48:31,703 --> 00:48:33,136
<i>And that despite all the years</i>

663
00:48:33,138 --> 00:48:36,507
<i>that we spent
trying to stop them,</i>

664
00:48:36,509 --> 00:48:38,875
<i>we never dared
to confront the truth.</i>

665
00:48:38,877 --> 00:48:40,710
Which truth?

666
00:48:40,712 --> 00:48:43,980
Humans have been the dominant
species for thousands of years

667
00:48:43,982 --> 00:48:45,581
and look what's happened.

668
00:48:45,583 --> 00:48:47,851
Overpopulation,

669
00:48:47,853 --> 00:48:51,087
<i>pollution, war.</i>

670
00:48:51,089 --> 00:48:55,592
<i>The mass extinction we feared
has already begun.</i>

671
00:48:55,594 --> 00:48:58,728
<i>And we are the cause.</i>

672
00:48:58,730 --> 00:49:01,431
<i>We are the infection.</i>

673
00:49:01,433 --> 00:49:03,500
<i>But like all living organisms,</i>

674
00:49:03,502 --> 00:49:06,904
<i>the earth unleashed a fever
to fight this infection.</i>

675
00:49:06,906 --> 00:49:10,940
<i>Its original
and rightful rulers,</i>

676
00:49:10,942 --> 00:49:12,608
<i>the Titans.</i>

677
00:49:12,610 --> 00:49:15,779
<i>They are part of the earth's
natural defense system.</i>

678
00:49:15,781 --> 00:49:20,050
<i>A way to protect the planet,
to maintain its balance.</i>

679
00:49:20,052 --> 00:49:24,188
<i>But if governments are allowed
to contain them, destroy them,</i>

680
00:49:24,190 --> 00:49:26,188
<i>or use them for war,</i>

681
00:49:26,190 --> 00:49:29,326
<i>the human infection will only
continue to spread.</i>

682
00:49:29,328 --> 00:49:35,398
<i>And within our lifetime,
our planet will perish,</i>

683
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:37,099
<i>and so will we.</i>

684
00:49:37,101 --> 00:49:40,103
Unless we restore balance.

685
00:49:40,105 --> 00:49:42,639
<i>And what's gonna
be left, if you do this?</i>

686
00:49:42,641 --> 00:49:46,376
<i>A dead, charred world,
overrun by monsters?</i>

687
00:49:46,378 --> 00:49:47,744
No, Doctor Stanton,

688
00:49:47,746 --> 00:49:49,413
<i>the exact opposite.</i>

689
00:49:49,415 --> 00:49:52,315
<i>Just like how a forest fire
replenishes the soil</i>

690
00:49:52,317 --> 00:49:54,918
<i>or how a volcano
creates new land,</i>

691
00:49:54,920 --> 00:49:57,654
<i>we have seen signs that these
creatures will do the same.</i>

692
00:49:57,656 --> 00:50:01,491
<i>San Francisco, Las Vegas,
wherever the Titans go,</i>

693
00:50:01,493 --> 00:50:05,195
<i>life follows,
triggered by their radiation.</i>

694
00:50:05,197 --> 00:50:07,364
<i>They are the only thing
that can reverse</i>

695
00:50:07,366 --> 00:50:09,233
<i>the destruction
that we started.</i>

696
00:50:09,235 --> 00:50:13,369
<i>They are the only guarantee
that life will carry on.</i>

697
00:50:13,371 --> 00:50:16,605
<i>But for that to happen,
we must set them free.</i>

698
00:50:16,607 --> 00:50:18,375
You are murdering the world.

699
00:50:18,377 --> 00:50:19,610
<i>No.</i>

700
00:50:19,612 --> 00:50:21,710
<i>Because as difficult
as this will be,</i>

701
00:50:21,712 --> 00:50:24,614
<i>I promise
humanity will not go extinct.</i>

702
00:50:24,616 --> 00:50:29,219
<i>Using the ORCA, we will return
to a natural order.</i>

703
00:50:29,221 --> 00:50:31,755
<i>A forgotten order,
where we coexisted</i>

704
00:50:31,757 --> 00:50:33,523
<i>in balance with the Titans.</i>

705
00:50:33,525 --> 00:50:35,458
<i>The first gods.</i>

706
00:50:35,460 --> 00:50:38,094
This is a dangerous path.

707
00:50:38,096 --> 00:50:41,331
You are meddling with forces
beyond our comprehension.

708
00:50:41,333 --> 00:50:43,366
Gambling with
the lives of billions!

709
00:50:43,368 --> 00:50:45,701
<i>And what are you gambling
with, Serizawa?</i>

710
00:50:45,703 --> 00:50:47,404
<i>Monarch is broken.</i>

711
00:50:47,406 --> 00:50:49,373
<i>It's on the verge of being
shut down by a government</i>

712
00:50:49,375 --> 00:50:51,808
<i>whose only objective is to
eradicate the creatures.</i>

713
00:50:51,810 --> 00:50:54,844
<i>And if that happens,
what will our chances be?</i>

714
00:50:54,846 --> 00:50:56,612
You are out
of your goddamn mind!

715
00:50:56,614 --> 00:50:58,482
<i>First, you put
our daughter's life in danger,</i>

716
00:50:58,484 --> 00:51:00,215
<i>and now you get to
decide the fate of the world.</i>

717
00:51:00,217 --> 00:51:02,719
- That's rich, Emma!
- I couldn't be more sane,

718
00:51:02,721 --> 00:51:04,922
<i>and Madison
couldn't be stronger.</i>

719
00:51:04,924 --> 00:51:07,891
<i>After we lost Andrew,
I trained her to survive.</i>

720
00:51:07,893 --> 00:51:11,128
<i>And at least now, she will
have a fighting chance.</i>

721
00:51:11,130 --> 00:51:13,297
A fighting chance? Why don't
you listen to yourself?

722
00:51:13,299 --> 00:51:15,465
<i>It's not all math, Emma.</i>

723
00:51:15,467 --> 00:51:17,300
<i>Some things,
you can't control.</i>

724
00:51:17,302 --> 00:51:19,938
<i>And there are some things
that you can't run from.</i>

725
00:51:21,373 --> 00:51:23,810
This won't bring him
back to us.

726
00:51:38,190 --> 00:51:41,060
<i>I can only urge you all
to take refuge.</i>

727
00:51:42,060 --> 00:51:43,659
<i>Over the last 60 years,</i>

728
00:51:43,661 --> 00:51:46,329
<i>Monarch has prepared bunkers
around the world</i>

729
00:51:46,331 --> 00:51:48,965
<i>to save
and restart civilization.</i>

730
00:51:48,967 --> 00:51:50,936
<i>I suggest you find them.</i>

731
00:51:58,143 --> 00:51:59,476
That bitch.

732
00:51:59,478 --> 00:52:01,978
How long
until this thing lands?

733
00:52:01,980 --> 00:52:03,313
Three minutes.

734
00:52:03,315 --> 00:52:04,882
You might
want to rethink that.

735
00:52:04,884 --> 00:52:06,250
Why?

736
00:52:06,252 --> 00:52:08,150
Something's not right.
Check this out.

737
00:52:08,152 --> 00:52:10,453
Emma's not at Isla de Mara.

738
00:52:10,455 --> 00:52:13,123
I mean, the signal's too weak
to be local.

739
00:52:13,125 --> 00:52:14,891
She's bouncing it off
our satellites.

740
00:52:14,893 --> 00:52:17,293
They must be holed up
in one of our old bunkers.

741
00:52:17,295 --> 00:52:19,094
She could be anywhere.

742
00:52:19,096 --> 00:52:22,632
What is that?

743
00:52:22,634 --> 00:52:26,670
Oh, Jesus! She shut down
the containment system.

744
00:52:26,672 --> 00:52:28,007
How much time do we have?

745
00:52:29,306 --> 00:52:30,773
Containment system bypassed.
We're patched in.

746
00:52:30,775 --> 00:52:32,578
- Hmm.
- Ready to broadcast the ORCA.

747
00:52:34,813 --> 00:52:36,248
Doctor?

748
00:52:49,795 --> 00:52:51,395
Mom, don't!

749
00:52:51,397 --> 00:52:54,496
I'm sorry, did a child
just tell you what to do?

750
00:52:54,498 --> 00:52:56,233
Maybe Dad is right.
Maybe this isn't the way.

751
00:52:56,235 --> 00:52:57,933
By all means, Doctor Russell,

752
00:52:57,935 --> 00:52:59,501
let's reconsider
our entire plan.

753
00:52:59,503 --> 00:53:01,204
Especially after telling
your friends about it.

754
00:53:01,206 --> 00:53:03,040
Madison, we talked about this.

755
00:53:03,042 --> 00:53:04,507
No, you said you were
gonna help people,

756
00:53:04,509 --> 00:53:05,942
that you would let them
find shelter.

757
00:53:05,944 --> 00:53:09,279
We don't have time for this!

758
00:53:09,281 --> 00:53:11,215
Did you really think
this was gonna be easy?

759
00:53:11,217 --> 00:53:12,815
Painless?
Is that what you told her?

760
00:53:12,817 --> 00:53:14,317
Leave her out of this.

761
00:53:14,319 --> 00:53:15,985
Why? You're the one
who pulled her into it.

762
00:53:15,987 --> 00:53:20,023
Madison, tell me, what exactly
did Mommy sell you on?

763
00:53:20,025 --> 00:53:21,525
Some grand utopia?

764
00:53:21,527 --> 00:53:23,393
Man and monster,
living together

765
00:53:23,395 --> 00:53:24,927
in blissful harmony?

766
00:53:24,929 --> 00:53:27,230
Sir, they're
attempting to lock us out.

767
00:53:27,232 --> 00:53:28,632
It's now or never.

768
00:53:28,634 --> 00:53:33,304
Emma, you came to me.
This is your plan.

769
00:53:33,306 --> 00:53:35,239
We both want
to save the planet,

770
00:53:35,241 --> 00:53:36,473
but everything is going to die

771
00:53:36,475 --> 00:53:38,507
if we don't see it through.

772
00:53:38,509 --> 00:53:42,415
Please, at least let them
get to safety.

773
00:53:44,116 --> 00:53:47,286
Ma'am, our window's closing.

774
00:53:48,920 --> 00:53:50,423
Mom...

775
00:53:53,324 --> 00:53:55,090
I'm sorry, Madison.

776
00:53:55,092 --> 00:53:57,096
This is bigger
than just you and me.

777
00:54:22,621 --> 00:54:24,221
Tell them
to slow it down!

778
00:54:24,223 --> 00:54:25,725
Tell them to stand back!

779
00:54:33,764 --> 00:54:36,134
Move! Get out of the way!

780
00:55:00,458 --> 00:55:01,659
Clear, men!

781
00:55:40,264 --> 00:55:42,364
You got a catchy name
for this one?

782
00:55:42,366 --> 00:55:44,067
Local legends call it

783
00:55:44,069 --> 00:55:46,770
Rodan, the fire demon.

784
00:55:46,772 --> 00:55:49,005
That's comforting.

785
00:55:49,007 --> 00:55:50,373
Guys?

786
00:55:50,375 --> 00:55:52,141
You remember
that tropical storm

787
00:55:52,143 --> 00:55:53,409
where we lost Monster Zero?

788
00:55:53,411 --> 00:55:56,246
It's changing direction
and, uh,

789
00:55:56,248 --> 00:55:57,748
guess where it's headed now.

790
00:55:57,750 --> 00:55:59,782
That's not possible.

791
00:55:59,784 --> 00:56:01,617
No storm moves that fast.

792
00:56:01,619 --> 00:56:04,322
Unless
it's not a storm.

793
00:56:06,424 --> 00:56:08,023
- Oh, man!
- We need time

794
00:56:08,025 --> 00:56:09,293
to finish the evacuation.

795
00:56:09,295 --> 00:56:10,460
Well,
then you'd better hurry,

796
00:56:10,462 --> 00:56:11,661
'cause it's closing in fast.

797
00:56:11,663 --> 00:56:13,862
Serizawa,
it's not a coincidence

798
00:56:13,864 --> 00:56:15,866
that Monster Zero thing
is headed here.

799
00:56:15,868 --> 00:56:17,599
It's reacting
to Big Bird's cries.

800
00:56:17,601 --> 00:56:19,703
That means it's coming
for food, a fight, or a...

801
00:56:19,705 --> 00:56:22,105
Something more intimate.

802
00:56:22,107 --> 00:56:24,110
What do you suggest?

803
00:56:25,610 --> 00:56:27,110
<i>All fighters,</i>

804
00:56:27,112 --> 00:56:28,848
<i>weapons free.</i>

805
00:56:51,802 --> 00:56:53,436
Oh, I think
we got his attention.

806
00:56:53,438 --> 00:56:55,137
Everyone strap in.

807
00:56:55,139 --> 00:56:57,375
All ships, follow our lead.

808
00:57:32,310 --> 00:57:33,942
No!

809
00:57:35,179 --> 00:57:36,478
Please! Wait!

810
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:38,248
It's gonna be okay!

811
00:57:38,250 --> 00:57:39,851
Hang on, kid!

812
00:57:56,235 --> 00:57:57,733
<i>Argo</i> to Gold Squadron.

813
00:57:57,735 --> 00:58:00,069
Let's lure this turkey
away from the mainland

814
00:58:00,071 --> 00:58:01,204
straight to Monster Zero.

815
00:58:01,206 --> 00:58:02,471
ETA two minutes!

816
00:58:02,473 --> 00:58:04,306
Gold Squadron,
engage on our six.

817
00:58:04,308 --> 00:58:05,910
<i>Copy. Start the clock.</i>

818
00:58:23,994 --> 00:58:26,264
<i>Bogey.
Nine o'clock high!</i>

819
00:58:33,404 --> 00:58:35,170
Duster 223.

820
00:58:35,172 --> 00:58:37,040
<i>Get out of there. He's on
your tail! Get out of there!</i>

821
00:58:45,650 --> 00:58:47,284
Cobra's Raptor
is off the team!

822
00:58:47,286 --> 00:58:49,755
ETA to Monster Zero,
60 seconds!

823
00:58:51,989 --> 00:58:53,223
<i>Raptor 37.</i>

824
00:58:53,225 --> 00:58:55,460
<i>Bogey coming up on your six.</i>

825
00:59:06,538 --> 00:59:07,670
<i>I'm losing control here.</i>

826
00:59:07,672 --> 00:59:08,938
<i>I'm losing control!</i>

827
00:59:14,378 --> 00:59:16,279
We lost the squadron!

828
00:59:16,281 --> 00:59:18,516
ETA to Monster Zero,
30 seconds!

829
00:59:36,167 --> 00:59:37,369
Ten seconds!

830
00:59:58,623 --> 01:00:01,025
Dive! Dive!

831
01:00:25,417 --> 01:00:27,183
Jesus,
they're killing each other.

832
01:00:27,185 --> 01:00:28,418
<i>Mayday, mayday!
This is Raptor One to</i> Argo.

833
01:00:28,420 --> 01:00:30,152
Argo, <i>do you read?</i>

834
01:00:30,154 --> 01:00:31,820
<i>Copy, Raptor
One. What's your status?</i>

835
01:00:31,822 --> 01:00:33,556
<i>We're screwed,
that's what.</i>

836
01:00:33,558 --> 01:00:34,958
And we got kids on board.

837
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:36,692
We're gonna need
immediate mid-air retrieval.

838
01:00:36,694 --> 01:00:38,094
Lock on to their position,
and prepare the hangar

839
01:00:38,096 --> 01:00:39,728
for an emergency landing.

840
01:00:39,730 --> 01:00:40,962
Hangar doors are unresponsive.

841
01:00:40,964 --> 01:00:43,368
- Manual override?
- They're stuck!

842
01:00:44,935 --> 01:00:46,235
All right,
which way to the hangar?

843
01:00:46,237 --> 01:00:47,369
I can show you.

844
01:00:47,371 --> 01:00:49,005
Anybody else?

845
01:00:49,007 --> 01:00:51,574
I know the way.
I... Come on!

846
01:00:51,576 --> 01:00:53,011
Hope you got a big wrench.

847
01:01:02,353 --> 01:01:04,221
What's the problem?

848
01:01:04,223 --> 01:01:05,621
Hydraulics systems are jammed!

849
01:01:05,623 --> 01:01:07,389
I'm trying to
jump-start power.

850
01:01:07,391 --> 01:01:08,525
It's not looking good.

851
01:01:17,168 --> 01:01:19,504
It's Admiral Stenz.

852
01:01:20,337 --> 01:01:22,005
Admiral.

853
01:01:22,007 --> 01:01:23,840
<i>Doctor
Serizawa, Colonel Foster.</i>

854
01:01:23,842 --> 01:01:25,608
<i>I need you and your forces
to immediately disengage</i>

855
01:01:25,610 --> 01:01:27,375
<i>and withdraw
to a safe distance.</i>

856
01:01:27,377 --> 01:01:29,512
Admiral, I don't understand.

857
01:01:29,514 --> 01:01:33,349
<i>We have been developing
a prototype for a new weapon.</i>

858
01:01:33,351 --> 01:01:35,050
<i>An oxygen destroyer.</i>

859
01:01:35,052 --> 01:01:38,255
<i>Designed to exterminate
all life forms</i>

860
01:01:38,257 --> 01:01:39,788
<i>within a two-mile radius.</i>

861
01:01:39,790 --> 01:01:41,757
<i>With any luck,
it will kill these things</i>

862
01:01:41,759 --> 01:01:44,126
<i>and this nightmare
will finally be over.</i>

863
01:01:44,128 --> 01:01:45,927
Admiral, we must
keep our faith in <i>Gojira.</i>

864
01:01:45,929 --> 01:01:48,598
<i>I'm sorry, Doctor.
You had your chance.</i>

865
01:01:48,600 --> 01:01:49,965
<i>The missile is
already on its way.</i>

866
01:01:49,967 --> 01:01:52,204
<i>May God have mercy on us all.</i>

867
01:01:55,739 --> 01:01:57,540
He's not lying.

868
01:01:57,542 --> 01:01:59,342
It's coming in hot.

869
01:01:59,344 --> 01:02:01,710
Argo, <i>you gotta get
those bay doors open now!</i>

870
01:02:01,712 --> 01:02:03,378
Have the crash
and fire crews ready.

871
01:02:09,888 --> 01:02:11,757
What the hell do you think
you're doing?

872
01:02:15,092 --> 01:02:17,462
Look out!

873
01:02:21,900 --> 01:02:22,901
Hold on!

874
01:02:24,936 --> 01:02:26,969
Come on, Griff! Come on!

875
01:02:26,971 --> 01:02:30,476
Hit it! Hit it!

876
01:02:46,190 --> 01:02:48,023
That's what
I'm talking about, Griff!

877
01:02:48,025 --> 01:02:50,027
Everybody okay?

878
01:02:51,295 --> 01:02:53,061
Get over
to the back of the hangar.

879
01:02:53,063 --> 01:02:54,730
We're all gonna head this way.
This way. This way.

880
01:02:54,732 --> 01:02:56,565
Thanks for the lift!

881
01:02:58,569 --> 01:02:59,971
Go! Go!

882
01:03:02,206 --> 01:03:03,808
Oh, God!

883
01:03:28,734 --> 01:03:29,965
We're getting
out of here.

884
01:03:29,967 --> 01:03:31,567
The military
launched a weapon.

885
01:03:31,569 --> 01:03:32,768
It's gonna kill 'em both.

886
01:03:32,770 --> 01:03:34,670
Well, that's not
the worst idea.

887
01:03:42,413 --> 01:03:43,980
Ten,

888
01:03:43,982 --> 01:03:45,217
nine,

889
01:03:46,417 --> 01:03:47,983
eight,

890
01:03:47,985 --> 01:03:49,654
seven...

891
01:04:00,630 --> 01:04:04,036
...three, two...

892
01:04:48,380 --> 01:04:50,246
Jesus.

893
01:04:50,248 --> 01:04:53,549
Doctor Stanton,
can you locate <i>Gojira?</i>

894
01:04:55,520 --> 01:04:58,322
Yeah. I got something.

895
01:05:00,058 --> 01:05:05,163
His vitals are fading.
Radiation levels plummeting.

896
01:05:06,831 --> 01:05:09,101
Come on, big guy. Fight it.

897
01:05:19,377 --> 01:05:20,779
He's gone.

898
01:05:24,147 --> 01:05:27,118
Looks like you got
your wish, Mark.

899
01:06:51,469 --> 01:06:54,503
I thought we were going
to release them gradually.

900
01:06:54,505 --> 01:06:56,942
One at a time.

901
01:06:57,875 --> 01:07:00,344
I'm not the one doing this.

902
01:07:06,016 --> 01:07:08,052
Long live the king.

903
01:07:19,596 --> 01:07:21,465
You're a monster.

904
01:07:33,277 --> 01:07:35,011
<i>Castle Bravo, this is</i>

905
01:07:35,013 --> 01:07:37,012
<i>Containment Team Mosura.
Do you read? Over.</i>

906
01:07:37,014 --> 01:07:38,547
Castle Bravo,
this is Containment Team.

907
01:07:38,549 --> 01:07:39,614
Anything?

908
01:07:39,616 --> 01:07:40,983
Dr. Brooks.

909
01:07:40,985 --> 01:07:42,552
We've lost contact
with the <i>Argo,</i>

910
01:07:42,554 --> 01:07:44,554
Castle Bravo and the other
containment sites.

911
01:07:44,556 --> 01:07:47,857
Angkor Wat, Skull Island,
Stone Mountain.

912
01:07:47,859 --> 01:07:50,525
All the Titans,
they're escaping.

913
01:07:50,527 --> 01:07:53,063
<i>Repeat,
this may be our last comm.</i>

914
01:07:54,699 --> 01:07:56,431
Wait, wait, wait.

915
01:07:56,433 --> 01:07:58,000
It's... It's him.

916
01:07:58,002 --> 01:07:59,835
He's the one doing this.

917
01:07:59,837 --> 01:08:03,373
They're responding
to his call.

918
01:08:04,308 --> 01:08:06,578
Oh, God!
Where's Doctor Ling?

919
01:08:07,779 --> 01:08:09,380
She's outside.

920
01:08:10,781 --> 01:08:14,953
Doctor Ling! We've lost
contact with Monarch.

921
01:08:16,454 --> 01:08:18,056
Doctor Ling?

922
01:09:28,625 --> 01:09:30,627
- Madison, wait!
- Get away from me!

923
01:09:30,629 --> 01:09:32,327
Look, I know things
haven't gone

924
01:09:32,329 --> 01:09:34,796
exactly according to plan,
but I can fix this.

925
01:09:34,798 --> 01:09:36,131
According to plan?

926
01:09:36,133 --> 01:09:37,500
You said that you were
gonna be careful.

927
01:09:37,502 --> 01:09:38,867
That you'd release them
one at a time,

928
01:09:38,869 --> 01:09:40,101
that you would
restore balance!

929
01:09:40,103 --> 01:09:41,570
They were gonna
take over Monarch

930
01:09:41,572 --> 01:09:43,104
and kill the Titans.
I didn't have a choice.

931
01:09:43,106 --> 01:09:44,942
Bullshit!

932
01:09:48,245 --> 01:09:51,583
You said we were
doing this for Andrew.

933
01:09:56,053 --> 01:09:59,391
Do you really think
he would've wanted this?

934
01:10:06,330 --> 01:10:07,998
Exactly.

935
01:10:12,337 --> 01:10:13,605
Madison!

936
01:10:16,441 --> 01:10:17,609
Madison!

937
01:10:30,355 --> 01:10:31,990
Any luck?

938
01:10:32,757 --> 01:10:34,657
No.

939
01:10:34,659 --> 01:10:38,226
Whatever Emma used
to create the ORCA signal,

940
01:10:38,228 --> 01:10:39,827
I've never heard it.

941
01:10:39,829 --> 01:10:40,997
How are you doing?

942
01:10:42,799 --> 01:10:44,100
How's that?

943
01:10:44,102 --> 01:10:46,635
"Myth is our compass."

944
01:10:46,637 --> 01:10:48,737
It's something
my mom used to say.

945
01:10:48,739 --> 01:10:51,439
She believed our stories
about monsters and dragons

946
01:10:51,441 --> 01:10:54,542
could help us find the Titans

947
01:10:54,544 --> 01:10:56,412
and restore
our connection to nature.

948
01:10:56,414 --> 01:10:57,912
Wait, your mother?

949
01:10:57,914 --> 01:10:59,515
You're second-generation
Monarch?

950
01:10:59,517 --> 01:11:01,149
Third.

951
01:11:01,151 --> 01:11:03,418
It runs in the family.

952
01:11:03,420 --> 01:11:05,186
That's incredible.

953
01:11:05,188 --> 01:11:06,488
I don't suppose
your family has any tips

954
01:11:06,490 --> 01:11:07,857
on slaying dragons, do they?

955
01:11:07,859 --> 01:11:10,592
Slaying dragons
is a Western concept.

956
01:11:10,594 --> 01:11:12,594
In the East, they are sacred.

957
01:11:12,596 --> 01:11:16,534
Divine creatures who brought
wisdom, strength,

958
01:11:17,535 --> 01:11:19,137
even redemption.

959
01:11:21,938 --> 01:11:23,206
This oxygen destroyer,

960
01:11:23,208 --> 01:11:24,506
why wasn't
Monster Zero affected?

961
01:11:24,508 --> 01:11:25,808
I mean,
I'm no scientist,

962
01:11:25,810 --> 01:11:27,341
but I think
it has something to do

963
01:11:27,343 --> 01:11:28,676
with his goddamn head
growing back.

964
01:11:28,678 --> 01:11:30,445
Well, I've never seen
anything like it.

965
01:11:30,447 --> 01:11:32,948
It violates everything we know
about the natural order.

966
01:11:32,950 --> 01:11:35,850
Unless he's not
part of the natural order.

967
01:11:35,852 --> 01:11:37,153
What do you mean?

968
01:11:37,155 --> 01:11:40,790
I was able to
piece this together.

969
01:11:40,792 --> 01:11:43,692
Well, he looks
vaguely familiar.

970
01:11:43,694 --> 01:11:45,760
It tells
of a great dragon

971
01:11:45,762 --> 01:11:47,363
who fell from the stars.

972
01:11:47,365 --> 01:11:51,900
A Hydra whose storm swallowed
both men and gods alike.

973
01:11:51,902 --> 01:11:53,402
What, you mean an alien?

974
01:11:53,404 --> 01:11:56,005
Yes. He's not
part of our natural order.

975
01:11:56,007 --> 01:11:57,872
And he's not meant to be here.

976
01:11:57,874 --> 01:11:59,475
A false king.

977
01:11:59,477 --> 01:12:01,176
An invasive species.

978
01:12:01,178 --> 01:12:03,746
That could explain how he's
creating these massive storms

979
01:12:03,748 --> 01:12:06,448
and the effect he's having
on the other Titans.

980
01:12:06,450 --> 01:12:08,216
It's almost like
he's reshaping the planet

981
01:12:08,218 --> 01:12:09,585
to his own liking.

982
01:12:09,587 --> 01:12:11,220
These legends,
what did they call him?

983
01:12:11,222 --> 01:12:14,626
Ghidorah.
"The one who is many."

984
01:12:15,191 --> 01:12:16,257
Ghi-what?

985
01:12:16,259 --> 01:12:17,460
She said, "Gonorrhea."

986
01:12:17,462 --> 01:12:18,927
- Huh?
- Ghidorah!

987
01:12:18,929 --> 01:12:21,663
Doctor Serizawa, we're
approaching Castle Bravo,

988
01:12:21,665 --> 01:12:24,198
but there's something
you should see.

989
01:12:28,639 --> 01:12:32,408
I'm guessing you weren't
expecting these guys.

990
01:12:32,410 --> 01:12:36,778
Moscow,
London, Washington, D.C.,

991
01:12:36,780 --> 01:12:38,546
all under attack.

992
01:12:38,548 --> 01:12:40,783
On every continent,
the Titans are triggering

993
01:12:40,785 --> 01:12:43,752
earthquakes, wildfires,
tsunamis,

994
01:12:43,754 --> 01:12:47,322
and disasters we don't even
have names for yet.

995
01:12:47,324 --> 01:12:49,859
Now as before,
we have been trying to lure

996
01:12:49,861 --> 01:12:51,527
the creatures
with nuclear materials,

997
01:12:51,529 --> 01:12:54,197
but they are not
taking the bait this time.

998
01:12:54,199 --> 01:12:56,931
Their behavior
has become random.

999
01:12:56,933 --> 01:12:58,400
Erratic.

1000
01:12:58,402 --> 01:13:00,868
And with our forces
spread desperately thin

1001
01:13:00,870 --> 01:13:03,973
and these things
roaming the globe unimpeded,

1002
01:13:03,975 --> 01:13:06,174
we are running out of options

1003
01:13:06,176 --> 01:13:07,576
and time.

1004
01:13:07,578 --> 01:13:10,112
Excuse me,
do you have something to add?

1005
01:13:10,114 --> 01:13:12,247
Yeah. You're wrong.

1006
01:13:12,249 --> 01:13:15,885
Their behavior
is not random or erratic.

1007
01:13:15,887 --> 01:13:16,985
If I may, sir.

1008
01:13:16,987 --> 01:13:19,488
As amazing as this sounds,

1009
01:13:19,490 --> 01:13:21,723
they're moving like a pack.
They're hunting.

1010
01:13:21,725 --> 01:13:25,461
All packs, from wolves
to killer whales,

1011
01:13:25,463 --> 01:13:28,064
they all respond
directly to an alpha.

1012
01:13:28,066 --> 01:13:29,732
And this Ghidorah
is the new alpha.

1013
01:13:29,734 --> 01:13:32,266
And all the other creatures
are just doing his bidding.

1014
01:13:32,268 --> 01:13:34,703
They're an extension of him.

1015
01:13:34,705 --> 01:13:38,239
We stop him, we stop them all.

1016
01:13:38,241 --> 01:13:39,574
Is there another creature

1017
01:13:39,576 --> 01:13:40,975
that might stand
a chance against him?

1018
01:13:40,977 --> 01:13:42,711
No.

1019
01:13:42,713 --> 01:13:46,549
Ghidorah and <i>Gojira's</i> rivalry
was ancient and unique.

1020
01:13:46,551 --> 01:13:48,516
Right, so we killed
our best shot

1021
01:13:48,518 --> 01:13:50,318
at beating this thing?

1022
01:13:50,320 --> 01:13:53,288
<i>Jonah, you don't get it.
This changes everything.</i>

1023
01:13:53,290 --> 01:13:54,723
<i>With Godzilla gone,</i>

1024
01:13:54,725 --> 01:13:55,890
<i>Monster Zero
isn't using the Titans</i>

1025
01:13:55,892 --> 01:13:57,692
to restore the planet.

1026
01:13:57,694 --> 01:14:00,429
He is using them
to destroy it.

1027
01:14:00,431 --> 01:14:02,730
This isn't coexistence.
This is extinction.

1028
01:14:02,732 --> 01:14:05,067
Listen, while you were
sitting comfortably

1029
01:14:05,069 --> 01:14:06,335
in some laboratory,

1030
01:14:06,337 --> 01:14:08,336
we've been fighting
for decades

1031
01:14:08,338 --> 01:14:10,840
in one dirty war
after another.

1032
01:14:10,842 --> 01:14:12,875
I've seen
human nature firsthand

1033
01:14:12,877 --> 01:14:13,943
and I'm here to tell you

1034
01:14:13,945 --> 01:14:15,077
that it doesn't
get any better.

1035
01:14:15,079 --> 01:14:16,412
It just gets worse.

1036
01:14:16,414 --> 01:14:18,814
So, I'm sorry
that Monster Zero

1037
01:14:18,816 --> 01:14:21,750
isn't exactly
what we were expecting.

1038
01:14:21,752 --> 01:14:27,458
But we opened Pandora's Box
and there's no closing it now.

1039
01:14:29,392 --> 01:14:30,759
Maybe there is.

1040
01:14:30,761 --> 01:14:32,493
Oh, don't be stupid.

1041
01:14:32,495 --> 01:14:35,697
You broadcast again,
and you will expose us all.

1042
01:14:35,699 --> 01:14:38,065
These creatures
communicate like whales, okay?

1043
01:14:38,067 --> 01:14:40,601
<i>They can hear
sonar for thousands of miles,</i>

1044
01:14:40,603 --> 01:14:42,871
<i>so let's send a team.</i>

1045
01:14:42,873 --> 01:14:45,006
<i>Let's broadcast the ORCA
from Fenway.</i>

1046
01:14:45,008 --> 01:14:46,708
<i>It's just a few miles
from here.</i>

1047
01:14:46,710 --> 01:14:49,511
I could use the stadium
to amplify a signal

1048
01:14:49,513 --> 01:14:51,212
that might stop these attacks.

1049
01:14:51,214 --> 01:14:54,082
<i>The city's already being
evacuated, so it'll be safe.</i>

1050
01:14:54,084 --> 01:14:55,684
<i>And then what?</i>

1051
01:14:55,686 --> 01:14:57,252
<i>And then I'll figure out
what the hell</i>

1052
01:14:57,254 --> 01:14:59,322
<i>Monster Zero really is
and try to stop it.</i>

1053
01:14:59,324 --> 01:15:00,622
<i>Before Monarch finds us?</i>

1054
01:15:00,624 --> 01:15:02,123
<i>I'm sure
all your friends will be</i>

1055
01:15:02,125 --> 01:15:03,524
<i>very happy to see you again.</i>

1056
01:15:03,526 --> 01:15:05,327
<i>We can't just sit here.</i>

1057
01:15:05,329 --> 01:15:08,162
<i>All right? This isn't
the world that we wanted.</i>

1058
01:15:08,164 --> 01:15:09,797
<i>I seem to remember
you telling me</i>

1059
01:15:09,799 --> 01:15:12,667
<i>that the world
always belonged to them.</i>

1060
01:15:12,669 --> 01:15:15,974
<i>Well, maybe it is time
we gave it back.</i>

1061
01:15:18,808 --> 01:15:20,710
Mark!

1062
01:15:20,712 --> 01:15:23,112
Mark, wait.
What are you doing?

1063
01:15:23,114 --> 01:15:25,948
I can't just sit down there.
I gotta do something.

1064
01:15:25,950 --> 01:15:27,283
Like what?

1065
01:15:27,285 --> 01:15:29,217
- Like go find my daughter.
- How?

1066
01:15:29,219 --> 01:15:30,621
Where are you gonna go?

1067
01:15:32,389 --> 01:15:34,859
She's the only thing
I got left, Sam.

1068
01:15:37,094 --> 01:15:38,460
I wasn't there for her.

1069
01:15:38,462 --> 01:15:40,897
I'm not gonna
let that happen again.

1070
01:15:42,799 --> 01:15:43,935
Good luck.

1071
01:16:55,972 --> 01:16:57,475
Beautiful.

1072
01:16:58,674 --> 01:16:59,808
Mothra.

1073
01:16:59,810 --> 01:17:03,479
Queen of the Monsters.

1074
01:17:03,481 --> 01:17:05,883
Are you recording this,
Stanton?

1075
01:17:07,685 --> 01:17:10,952
I record everything now.

1076
01:17:10,954 --> 01:17:12,657
Everything.

1077
01:17:13,958 --> 01:17:16,457
It's like a song.

1078
01:17:16,459 --> 01:17:18,193
I bet
there's only one thing

1079
01:17:18,195 --> 01:17:19,897
that can understand this.

1080
01:17:21,298 --> 01:17:22,734
Godzilla.

1081
01:17:26,603 --> 01:17:28,737
Yeah, I got it.

1082
01:17:28,739 --> 01:17:31,008
Picking up a reply.
Bringing it up.

1083
01:17:36,446 --> 01:17:38,548
He's still alive.

1084
01:17:40,718 --> 01:17:44,586
So, her and Godzilla,
they're like...

1085
01:17:44,588 --> 01:17:45,953
They got a thing going on?

1086
01:17:45,955 --> 01:17:47,890
That's kind of
messed up, right?

1087
01:17:47,892 --> 01:17:50,625
Symbiotic relationships
between two different species

1088
01:17:50,627 --> 01:17:53,560
aren't all that uncommon.

1089
01:17:53,562 --> 01:17:55,096
Can you track him?

1090
01:17:55,098 --> 01:17:58,069
No. Signal's too weak.

1091
01:17:59,669 --> 01:18:01,139
But maybe she can.

1092
01:18:05,342 --> 01:18:07,411
How many nukes do you have?

1093
01:18:08,178 --> 01:18:10,110
Why?

1094
01:18:10,112 --> 01:18:11,715
We could help him.

1095
01:18:17,887 --> 01:18:19,921
This category
six hurricane over D.C.

1096
01:18:19,923 --> 01:18:21,957
is where King Ghidorah
is nesting.

1097
01:18:21,959 --> 01:18:24,025
Working with all four branches
of the military,

1098
01:18:24,027 --> 01:18:25,627
this will be a joint operation

1099
01:18:25,629 --> 01:18:28,028
to lure it away
from the mainland,

1100
01:18:28,030 --> 01:18:30,698
<i>so that we can continue
evacuations long enough</i>

1101
01:18:30,700 --> 01:18:33,437
<i>for our submersible team
to complete its mission.</i>

1102
01:18:36,906 --> 01:18:40,908
So this plan is what you would
call a "long shot," right?

1103
01:18:40,910 --> 01:18:42,644
What do those nerds
think they're gonna do

1104
01:18:42,646 --> 01:18:44,345
down there
with a bunch of nukes?

1105
01:18:44,347 --> 01:18:45,947
You ain't hear 'em, Griffin?

1106
01:18:45,949 --> 01:18:48,486
They wanna bring Godzilla
back from the dead.

1107
01:18:55,092 --> 01:18:57,493
<i>We'll be out of range
while you're down there,</i>

1108
01:18:57,495 --> 01:18:59,060
<i>but a squadron
will stay behind</i>

1109
01:18:59,062 --> 01:19:00,327
<i>to keep an eye out for you.</i>

1110
01:19:00,329 --> 01:19:01,697
<i>Appreciate it.</i>

1111
01:19:01,699 --> 01:19:02,997
<i>All righty, Bowman,</i>

1112
01:19:02,999 --> 01:19:04,433
let's take her down.

1113
01:19:04,435 --> 01:19:07,036
Dive the ship.
Make depth 150.

1114
01:19:07,038 --> 01:19:08,302
<i>Good luck.</i>

1115
01:19:08,304 --> 01:19:09,770
<i>Thanks, Sam.</i>

1116
01:19:09,772 --> 01:19:11,042
<i>We'll need it.</i>

1117
01:19:36,833 --> 01:19:38,736
What time is it?

1118
01:19:41,271 --> 01:19:43,573
Time to get a new watch.

1119
01:19:44,874 --> 01:19:48,042
Andrew's favorite joke.

1120
01:19:48,044 --> 01:19:50,078
You never took that watch
out of your pocket

1121
01:19:50,080 --> 01:19:52,115
without him asking
that question.

1122
01:19:55,651 --> 01:19:58,854
You told me five years ago,

1123
01:19:58,856 --> 01:20:02,193
I'd be trying to save
the thing that took my son,

1124
01:20:03,026 --> 01:20:04,292
that would be the only way

1125
01:20:04,294 --> 01:20:05,594
to save the family
I have left...

1126
01:20:05,596 --> 01:20:07,828
Sometimes,

1127
01:20:07,830 --> 01:20:10,931
the only way to heal
our wounds is to make peace

1128
01:20:10,933 --> 01:20:14,235
with the demons
who created them.

1129
01:20:14,237 --> 01:20:15,770
You really believe that?

1130
01:20:15,772 --> 01:20:17,307
Don't you?

1131
01:20:18,374 --> 01:20:19,877
Isn't that why you are here?

1132
01:20:23,146 --> 01:20:27,314
There are some things beyond
our understanding, Mark.

1133
01:20:27,316 --> 01:20:31,220
We must accept them
and learn from them,

1134
01:20:31,222 --> 01:20:33,188
because these moments
of crisis

1135
01:20:33,190 --> 01:20:36,127
are also potential
moments of faith.

1136
01:20:37,227 --> 01:20:38,460
A time

1137
01:20:38,462 --> 01:20:41,965
when we either come together
or fall apart.

1138
01:20:43,967 --> 01:20:47,271
Nature always has
a way of balancing itself.

1139
01:20:48,704 --> 01:20:50,707
The only question is,

1140
01:20:52,476 --> 01:20:55,713
what part will we play?

1141
01:20:57,047 --> 01:20:59,113
Did you just make that up?

1142
01:20:59,115 --> 01:21:00,114
No.

1143
01:21:00,116 --> 01:21:02,919
I read it
in a fortune cookie once.

1144
01:21:04,687 --> 01:21:06,856
A really long fortune cookie.

1145
01:21:12,029 --> 01:21:13,362
Status of the ship?

1146
01:21:13,364 --> 01:21:14,895
Some sort of vortex, Captain.

1147
01:21:14,897 --> 01:21:17,133
It's dragging us.
1600 feet till impact.

1148
01:21:21,571 --> 01:21:24,439
800 feet.

1149
01:21:24,441 --> 01:21:25,873
Emergency blow! 200 feet!

1150
01:21:25,875 --> 01:21:27,574
One hundred!

1151
01:21:27,576 --> 01:21:29,278
Twenty-five!

1152
01:21:29,280 --> 01:21:31,349
Brace for impact!

1153
01:22:49,793 --> 01:22:51,960
Argo, <i>this is</i> U.S.S. Brody

1154
01:22:51,962 --> 01:22:53,795
<i>en route
to evacuation perimeter.</i>

1155
01:22:53,797 --> 01:22:57,802
<i>Weapons hot. Ready to engage
Titans on your command.</i>

1156
01:22:59,236 --> 01:23:00,368
Jesus.

1157
01:23:00,370 --> 01:23:03,037
It's like
the whole sky's alive.

1158
01:23:04,641 --> 01:23:06,110
That's because it is.

1159
01:23:08,777 --> 01:23:10,780
Here we go.

1160
01:23:14,051 --> 01:23:15,416
Status report.

1161
01:23:15,418 --> 01:23:17,219
Can't fix our position.
GPS is down.

1162
01:23:17,221 --> 01:23:19,520
But inertial says we're...

1163
01:23:19,522 --> 01:23:21,390
600 miles from departure.

1164
01:23:21,392 --> 01:23:22,524
That can't be.

1165
01:23:22,526 --> 01:23:24,024
I knew it, man!

1166
01:23:24,026 --> 01:23:27,194
The vortex was a tunnel
into the Hollow Earth.

1167
01:23:27,196 --> 01:23:29,430
It's a subterranean
tunnel system

1168
01:23:29,432 --> 01:23:30,966
that connects
the entire planet.

1169
01:23:30,968 --> 01:23:32,266
It doesn't matter.
I knew I was right.

1170
01:23:32,268 --> 01:23:35,103
- I told you, Chen!
- Shut up, Rick.

1171
01:23:35,105 --> 01:23:37,208
One second emergency
blow forward.

1172
01:23:46,816 --> 01:23:48,750
Doctor?

1173
01:23:48,752 --> 01:23:50,821
Launch probes.

1174
01:24:03,933 --> 01:24:06,469
Range 1,000 meters.

1175
01:24:07,603 --> 01:24:09,373
Camera good.

1176
01:24:10,007 --> 01:24:12,373
Holding range.

1177
01:24:12,375 --> 01:24:14,410
Steady.

1178
01:24:17,780 --> 01:24:19,480
Jesus.

1179
01:24:19,482 --> 01:24:20,884
Pan right.

1180
01:24:45,508 --> 01:24:46,940
Looks Egyptian.

1181
01:24:46,942 --> 01:24:48,310
Or Roman.

1182
01:24:48,312 --> 01:24:49,911
No, this is
something different.

1183
01:24:49,913 --> 01:24:52,482
This is... This is way older.

1184
01:25:02,392 --> 01:25:03,860
Oh, my.

1185
01:25:13,437 --> 01:25:16,037
All of the legends,

1186
01:25:16,039 --> 01:25:18,105
the stories,

1187
01:25:18,107 --> 01:25:19,341
they are true.

1188
01:25:19,343 --> 01:25:21,510
They really were
the first gods.

1189
01:25:21,512 --> 01:25:23,444
If only the earth
and stones could speak,

1190
01:25:23,446 --> 01:25:25,779
the stories
they could tell us.

1191
01:25:25,781 --> 01:25:27,248
Doctor Stanton,

1192
01:25:27,250 --> 01:25:28,850
any sign of <i>Gojira?</i>

1193
01:25:28,852 --> 01:25:32,787
Yeah, the probe is
picking up a radioactive blob,

1194
01:25:32,789 --> 01:25:34,859
just past that ridge.

1195
01:25:35,659 --> 01:25:38,158
Set a course.

1196
01:25:44,601 --> 01:25:46,466
<i>Attention, please.</i>

1197
01:25:46,468 --> 01:25:48,703
<i>Martial law
has now been instated</i>

1198
01:25:48,705 --> 01:25:50,238
<i>by order of the President.</i>

1199
01:25:50,240 --> 01:25:51,805
<i>The greater Boston area</i>

1200
01:25:51,807 --> 01:25:54,141
<i>is now under control
of the U.S. Military.</i>

1201
01:25:54,143 --> 01:25:57,378
<i>All citizens to report to
the nearest evacuation center</i>

1202
01:25:57,380 --> 01:25:59,247
<i>for immediate transport.</i>

1203
01:25:59,249 --> 01:26:01,616
<i>I repeat, all citizens</i>

1204
01:26:01,618 --> 01:26:03,484
<i>are to report
to the nearest evacuation...</i>

1205
01:26:03,486 --> 01:26:05,319
<i>Massive
storms and other disasters</i>

1206
01:26:05,321 --> 01:26:06,887
<i>triggered by the Titans</i>

1207
01:26:06,889 --> 01:26:08,790
<i>have forced millions
to flee major cities.</i>

1208
01:26:08,792 --> 01:26:12,327
<i>And with D.C. hit hard
by a category six hurricane</i>

1209
01:26:12,329 --> 01:26:14,695
<i>that has left the capital
completely flooded,</i>

1210
01:26:14,697 --> 01:26:18,699
<i>this is the single greatest
disaster in human history.</i>

1211
01:26:18,701 --> 01:26:22,237
<i>The grim search continues,
as people around the world</i>

1212
01:26:22,239 --> 01:26:23,805
<i>sift through the debris
of leveled homes</i>

1213
01:26:23,807 --> 01:26:25,872
<i>in the hope of finding
missing loved ones.</i>

1214
01:26:25,874 --> 01:26:27,742
<i>And though this sight
is heartbreaking,</i>

1215
01:26:27,744 --> 01:26:30,077
<i>it is unfortunately
nothing unique.</i>

1216
01:26:30,079 --> 01:26:32,279
<i>Cities around the globe
have fallen</i>

1217
01:26:32,281 --> 01:26:33,982
<i>under the wake
of what many are calling</i>

1218
01:26:33,984 --> 01:26:36,387
<i>"The Rise of the Titans."</i>

1219
01:26:41,959 --> 01:26:43,891
I think we should stop.

1220
01:26:43,893 --> 01:26:45,393
Why?

1221
01:26:45,395 --> 01:26:47,394
'Cause I still wanna
have kids one day.

1222
01:26:47,396 --> 01:26:50,163
Preferably without flippers.

1223
01:26:50,165 --> 01:26:52,369
All stop. Hover the ship.

1224
01:27:01,678 --> 01:27:03,013
Whoa.

1225
01:27:03,946 --> 01:27:06,581
We got O2, CO2, and methane.

1226
01:27:06,583 --> 01:27:09,286
It looks like there's some
sort of air pocket in there.

1227
01:27:21,865 --> 01:27:23,064
My God.

1228
01:27:23,066 --> 01:27:24,468
Zilla.

1229
01:27:25,736 --> 01:27:28,135
- And goodnight, Gracie.
- Pull up the last frame.

1230
01:27:28,137 --> 01:27:29,503
- Yup.
- There.

1231
01:27:29,505 --> 01:27:31,271
The source of the radiation.

1232
01:27:31,273 --> 01:27:33,140
That's why
he returned here.

1233
01:27:33,142 --> 01:27:35,010
He's feeding,

1234
01:27:35,012 --> 01:27:36,647
regenerating.

1235
01:27:37,713 --> 01:27:39,682
This is his home.

1236
01:27:40,784 --> 01:27:43,885
This is how
he's survived for so long.

1237
01:27:43,887 --> 01:27:47,153
Always adapting, evolving.

1238
01:27:47,155 --> 01:27:48,389
It's incredible.

1239
01:27:48,391 --> 01:27:51,059
So,
dude's got this covered.

1240
01:27:51,061 --> 01:27:52,827
Right?
He just needs a little nap.

1241
01:27:52,829 --> 01:27:53,929
No.

1242
01:27:53,931 --> 01:27:55,930
This process could take years.

1243
01:27:55,932 --> 01:27:57,564
We have to proceed as planned.

1244
01:27:57,566 --> 01:27:58,632
Hang on.

1245
01:27:58,634 --> 01:28:01,068
We're gonna launch
a nuclear torpedo

1246
01:28:01,070 --> 01:28:03,503
in order to revive
a giant monster.

1247
01:28:03,505 --> 01:28:05,305
Okay, this is...
This is not like

1248
01:28:05,307 --> 01:28:06,908
we're just jump-starting
a car.

1249
01:28:06,910 --> 01:28:08,609
We have another complication.

1250
01:28:08,611 --> 01:28:11,177
Our weapons systems were
damaged during the crash.

1251
01:28:11,179 --> 01:28:12,247
We can't launch.

1252
01:28:12,249 --> 01:28:14,114
Can it be repaired?

1253
01:28:14,116 --> 01:28:15,817
I'm afraid not.

1254
01:28:15,819 --> 01:28:19,386
Okay. What if
we go inside, set a timer,

1255
01:28:19,388 --> 01:28:21,055
and blow up
the warhead manually?

1256
01:28:21,057 --> 01:28:24,926
No way. If the heat doesn't
fry you, the radiation will.

1257
01:28:28,432 --> 01:28:29,631
I'll go.

1258
01:28:29,633 --> 01:28:31,232
What the hell does that mean?

1259
01:28:31,234 --> 01:28:33,000
There must be another way.

1260
01:28:33,002 --> 01:28:34,571
There's no time for debate.

1261
01:28:35,972 --> 01:28:37,541
I'll go.

1262
01:28:55,557 --> 01:28:57,426
<i>Argo,</i> we are red on ammo

1263
01:28:57,428 --> 01:28:59,094
<i>and low on fuel. We can't
take much more of this!</i>

1264
01:28:59,096 --> 01:29:02,096
Copy, copy. Just hold them off
as long as you can.

1265
01:29:02,098 --> 01:29:03,197
Colonel,
take a look at this.

1266
01:29:03,199 --> 01:29:04,299
All the Titans have stopped.

1267
01:29:09,371 --> 01:29:11,805
What the hell
has gotten into them now?

1268
01:29:18,047 --> 01:29:20,247
<i>It does
appear as if the attacks</i>

1269
01:29:20,249 --> 01:29:21,917
<i>have ceased
for the time being,</i>

1270
01:29:21,919 --> 01:29:24,918
<i>with the creatures going
from destructive to docile</i>

1271
01:29:24,920 --> 01:29:26,320
<i>within minutes.</i>

1272
01:29:26,322 --> 01:29:28,421
<i>Now, no one is sure
how or why,</i>

1273
01:29:28,423 --> 01:29:30,992
<i>but this seems to be
happening simultaneously</i>

1274
01:29:30,994 --> 01:29:32,859
<i>around the world.</i>

1275
01:29:34,763 --> 01:29:36,631
What's going on?

1276
01:29:36,633 --> 01:29:38,168
The ORCA.

1277
01:29:38,767 --> 01:29:40,634
What?

1278
01:29:40,636 --> 01:29:43,406
I wonder
who could have done this.

1279
01:29:47,843 --> 01:29:49,612
Maddie?

1280
01:29:57,286 --> 01:29:59,155
Maddie.

1281
01:30:02,993 --> 01:30:05,159
First contact,
you're gonna start

1282
01:30:05,161 --> 01:30:07,095
losing your long-range vision.

1283
01:30:07,097 --> 01:30:08,395
When you surface,

1284
01:30:08,397 --> 01:30:09,796
your motor skills
are gonna start to fade,

1285
01:30:09,798 --> 01:30:12,000
but I put a helioxed mixture
in the tank,

1286
01:30:12,002 --> 01:30:15,839
which should help you
stay stable a little longer.

1287
01:30:17,307 --> 01:30:19,877
It was an honor, man.

1288
01:30:34,156 --> 01:30:35,892
Thank you.

1289
01:30:40,329 --> 01:30:42,198
My notes.

1290
01:30:44,767 --> 01:30:46,435
Are you sure?

1291
01:30:48,105 --> 01:30:50,838
He fought for us, died for us.

1292
01:30:50,840 --> 01:30:54,945
He's not only proof
that coexistence is possible,

1293
01:30:56,413 --> 01:30:59,715
he is the key to it.

1294
01:31:02,485 --> 01:31:05,589
Take care of them, Mark.

1295
01:32:08,051 --> 01:32:10,984
Bowman, take us out, fast.

1296
01:32:10,986 --> 01:32:12,623
Aye, Captain.

1297
01:32:14,990 --> 01:32:17,293
He's clear.

1298
01:35:09,766 --> 01:35:11,398
You all right?

1299
01:35:11,400 --> 01:35:14,702
Bowman, send a distress
message to the <i>Argo.</i>

1300
01:35:14,704 --> 01:35:16,740
Aye, Captain.

1301
01:35:34,156 --> 01:35:36,192
See anything?

1302
01:36:43,392 --> 01:36:44,995
Nobody move!

1303
01:37:21,897 --> 01:37:24,299
Are you okay?

1304
01:37:24,301 --> 01:37:25,899
I know how to find 'em.

1305
01:37:31,473 --> 01:37:34,808
I know how to find 'em!

1306
01:37:34,810 --> 01:37:37,112
Let's make him proud
and not screw this up.

1307
01:37:39,315 --> 01:37:40,448
How did he, uh...

1308
01:37:40,450 --> 01:37:41,751
By saving us.

1309
01:37:44,887 --> 01:37:46,253
Sam, what've we got going on?

1310
01:37:46,255 --> 01:37:48,288
We think
Emma activated the ORCA

1311
01:37:48,290 --> 01:37:49,357
somewhere near Boston.

1312
01:37:49,359 --> 01:37:50,757
That's why Ghidorah
and Godzilla

1313
01:37:50,759 --> 01:37:52,426
are both headed that way now.

1314
01:37:52,428 --> 01:37:54,327
But we haven't been able to
pinpoint the exact location

1315
01:37:54,329 --> 01:37:56,430
without the missing piece
of the ORCA signal.

1316
01:37:56,432 --> 01:37:58,099
I've got the missing piece.

1317
01:37:58,101 --> 01:38:00,134
It's Godzilla, right?

1318
01:38:00,136 --> 01:38:01,972
- I know we already tried.
- It's not Godzilla.

1319
01:38:02,739 --> 01:38:03,871
It's us.

1320
01:38:03,873 --> 01:38:05,572
What do you mean "us"?

1321
01:38:05,574 --> 01:38:07,841
Emma combined the bioacoustics
of Godzilla with a human.

1322
01:38:07,843 --> 01:38:09,643
That's how she made
the signal for the ORCA.

1323
01:38:09,645 --> 01:38:11,746
The creatures just think
it's another apex predator.

1324
01:38:11,748 --> 01:38:13,314
Well, that makes sense.

1325
01:38:13,316 --> 01:38:14,782
I mean, we are a bunch of
horny murderous carnivores.

1326
01:38:14,784 --> 01:38:16,416
Yeah, that's real poetic.
Now what?

1327
01:38:16,418 --> 01:38:19,552
We track it, we find it,
and we get my daughter back.

1328
01:38:19,554 --> 01:38:22,989
What about Moe, Larry,
and Curly over here?

1329
01:38:22,991 --> 01:38:24,958
Godzilla will bring balance.

1330
01:38:24,960 --> 01:38:28,762
Oh, I get it. A little
Serizawa let-'em-fight action.

1331
01:38:28,764 --> 01:38:30,931
I used to love it
when he said that.

1332
01:38:30,933 --> 01:38:33,768
No. This time,
we join the fight.

1333
01:38:37,606 --> 01:38:39,038
What do you think
you're doing?

1334
01:38:39,040 --> 01:38:40,573
I don't have time
to argue about this, Jonah.

1335
01:38:40,575 --> 01:38:41,641
I'm getting Maddie back.

1336
01:38:41,643 --> 01:38:43,610
Not with my men, you're not.

1337
01:38:43,612 --> 01:38:46,113
Emma, you said this was about
the greater good.

1338
01:38:46,115 --> 01:38:49,516
That the planet deserved
a clean slate.

1339
01:38:49,518 --> 01:38:50,751
But now you're prepared

1340
01:38:50,753 --> 01:38:52,019
to put all our lives in danger

1341
01:38:52,021 --> 01:38:53,054
because your little girl
is missing.

1342
01:38:53,056 --> 01:38:54,287
The ORCA is with...

1343
01:38:54,289 --> 01:38:55,890
The ORCA
no longer matters.

1344
01:38:55,892 --> 01:38:58,728
Man does not control
the laws of nature.

1345
01:38:59,695 --> 01:39:01,397
And neither do you.

1346
01:39:11,007 --> 01:39:16,377
I already lost one child.
I'm not losing another.

1347
01:39:16,379 --> 01:39:18,381
I have to fix this.

1348
01:39:19,380 --> 01:39:20,850
Let her go.

1349
01:39:22,685 --> 01:39:24,888
We have everything we need.

1350
01:41:26,542 --> 01:41:28,178
Oh, shit!

1351
01:42:58,032 --> 01:43:00,333
Okay, we've zeroed in on
the last ping from the ORCA.

1352
01:43:00,335 --> 01:43:02,002
Fenway Park, dead ahead.

1353
01:43:02,004 --> 01:43:03,304
<i>We'll lay cover fire
to keep Ghidorah distracted.</i>

1354
01:43:03,306 --> 01:43:05,008
Copy that.

1355
01:43:07,243 --> 01:43:09,512
Colonel, all squadrons
are locked on target.

1356
01:43:10,480 --> 01:43:12,682
For Serizawa.

1357
01:43:46,615 --> 01:43:49,283
Is it just me
or has he been working out?

1358
01:43:49,285 --> 01:43:51,452
Are you kidding me?

1359
01:43:51,454 --> 01:43:52,918
Serizawa's got
that lizard juiced!

1360
01:43:52,920 --> 01:43:54,488
Damn right.

1361
01:43:55,758 --> 01:43:58,190
Oh, boy.
Godzilla's radiation levels

1362
01:43:58,192 --> 01:43:59,827
are going through the roof.

1363
01:43:59,829 --> 01:44:02,362
We got about 12 minutes
before he goes thermonuclear.

1364
01:44:02,364 --> 01:44:03,967
What do you mean?

1365
01:44:05,433 --> 01:44:06,900
I'm saying
in about 12 minutes,

1366
01:44:06,902 --> 01:44:09,202
it's gonna be a bad day
to be a Red Sox fan.

1367
01:44:10,606 --> 01:44:12,372
Okay, guys,
you need to find the ORCA,

1368
01:44:12,374 --> 01:44:14,207
get Madison,
and get the hell out of there.

1369
01:44:14,209 --> 01:44:15,842
<i>Whatever Serizawa did
to Godzilla</i>

1370
01:44:15,844 --> 01:44:17,478
<i>worked a little too well.</i>

1371
01:44:17,480 --> 01:44:19,212
<i>'Cause he's about to explode
like an atom bomb.</i>

1372
01:44:19,214 --> 01:44:20,413
Roger that.

1373
01:44:20,415 --> 01:44:22,084
Prepare for landing.

1374
01:44:43,172 --> 01:44:45,372
Go, go, go!

1375
01:44:45,374 --> 01:44:47,808
- Spread out!
- Flank left!

1376
01:44:47,810 --> 01:44:49,012
On me!

1377
01:44:58,920 --> 01:45:01,324
Madison!

1378
01:45:03,292 --> 01:45:05,762
I got something!
Over here.

1379
01:45:06,762 --> 01:45:08,097
Come check this out!

1380
01:45:10,798 --> 01:45:12,465
Are you all right?

1381
01:45:12,467 --> 01:45:16,235
I found the ORCA, sir,
it looks pretty banged up!

1382
01:45:16,237 --> 01:45:18,040
No sign of your daughter.

1383
01:45:24,346 --> 01:45:25,811
She's not here!

1384
01:45:25,813 --> 01:45:27,113
We gotta get out of here!

1385
01:45:27,115 --> 01:45:28,316
Let's go!

1386
01:46:43,726 --> 01:46:44,727
Get in!

1387
01:46:47,228 --> 01:46:48,929
Incoming!

1388
01:46:51,334 --> 01:46:52,399
Get in!

1389
01:46:52,401 --> 01:46:54,634
Griffin, you all right?

1390
01:46:54,636 --> 01:46:56,103
Martinez, let's get her up.

1391
01:47:05,047 --> 01:47:06,345
Where's Madison?

1392
01:47:06,347 --> 01:47:07,380
I don't know.
I thought she was there!

1393
01:47:07,382 --> 01:47:08,618
Well, she's not there!

1394
01:47:11,120 --> 01:47:12,318
Take it easy!

1395
01:47:12,320 --> 01:47:14,389
- Get that side.
- Okay, okay.

1396
01:47:16,424 --> 01:47:17,793
Look out!

1397
01:47:19,895 --> 01:47:21,228
I hope you're as good

1398
01:47:21,230 --> 01:47:22,496
at finding her
as you are losing her.

1399
01:47:22,498 --> 01:47:24,198
I didn't lose her,
she ran away.

1400
01:47:24,200 --> 01:47:25,265
Well, gee, I wonder why!

1401
01:47:25,267 --> 01:47:26,500
I can't blame that kid.

1402
01:47:26,502 --> 01:47:28,167
If I had these two
for parents,

1403
01:47:28,169 --> 01:47:29,638
I'd have run away
from home, too.

1404
01:47:33,141 --> 01:47:34,474
What did you just say?

1405
01:47:34,476 --> 01:47:36,275
If I had the two of you
for parents,

1406
01:47:36,277 --> 01:47:37,946
I'd run away from home, too.

1407
01:47:39,213 --> 01:47:40,279
Home.

1408
01:48:52,887 --> 01:48:55,654
Godzilla's radiation's
reaching critical mass.

1409
01:48:55,656 --> 01:48:57,591
Six minutes until he blows.

1410
01:48:57,593 --> 01:48:59,528
Order all remaining craft
to retreat!

1411
01:50:10,766 --> 01:50:12,567
Maddie!

1412
01:50:13,401 --> 01:50:14,835
Madison!

1413
01:50:14,837 --> 01:50:17,037
Maddie!

1414
01:50:17,039 --> 01:50:18,805
Madison!

1415
01:50:18,807 --> 01:50:21,006
Madison!

1416
01:50:21,008 --> 01:50:23,411
Madison!

1417
01:50:27,014 --> 01:50:28,084
Emma!

1418
01:50:29,285 --> 01:50:30,350
Maddie!

1419
01:50:30,352 --> 01:50:31,417
Martinez!

1420
01:50:31,419 --> 01:50:33,519
We got it. On three.

1421
01:50:33,521 --> 01:50:35,458
One, two, three...

1422
01:50:37,459 --> 01:50:38,828
Lift together.

1423
01:50:54,043 --> 01:50:55,777
Oh, my baby.

1424
01:50:56,611 --> 01:50:58,244
Is she breathing?

1425
01:50:58,246 --> 01:50:59,613
Mark, is she breathing?

1426
01:50:59,615 --> 01:51:00,816
Maddie.

1427
01:51:05,588 --> 01:51:06,922
Maddie.

1428
01:51:09,424 --> 01:51:10,623
Maddie.

1429
01:51:10,625 --> 01:51:12,225
Mom.

1430
01:51:12,227 --> 01:51:14,461
- Dad.
- Shh.

1431
01:51:14,463 --> 01:51:16,766
- Mom. Mom.
- We're here.

1432
01:53:08,575 --> 01:53:09,877
Roger that.

1433
01:53:09,879 --> 01:53:11,377
Osprey's coming
in two minutes.

1434
01:53:11,379 --> 01:53:13,679
We gotta work fast.

1435
01:53:13,681 --> 01:53:15,084
To do what?

1436
01:53:17,886 --> 01:53:19,152
You sure about this?

1437
01:53:19,154 --> 01:53:20,886
It's the only way
to save him.

1438
01:53:20,888 --> 01:53:22,588
We fix it, get on the osprey

1439
01:53:22,590 --> 01:53:24,190
and draw that thing away
from Godzilla.

1440
01:53:24,192 --> 01:53:26,227
Buy him time to get back
on his feet.

1441
01:53:37,639 --> 01:53:39,305
Mark, you've seen
what that thing can do.

1442
01:53:39,307 --> 01:53:42,110
I know. It'll be tight, but
we have to take that chance.

1443
01:53:48,984 --> 01:53:50,250
Are you good to go?

1444
01:53:50,252 --> 01:53:51,318
Yes.

1445
01:53:51,320 --> 01:53:53,152
All right. One, two,

1446
01:53:53,154 --> 01:53:54,220
three.

1447
01:53:58,192 --> 01:53:59,391
That's it.

1448
01:53:59,393 --> 01:54:00,560
That's it!

1449
01:54:06,433 --> 01:54:08,036
Come on, Griff. We got you.

1450
01:54:10,704 --> 01:54:12,372
Come on, Emma. Let's go.

1451
01:54:12,374 --> 01:54:13,706
Okay. Take her. Take her!

1452
01:54:13,708 --> 01:54:15,140
I still have to activate it.

1453
01:54:15,142 --> 01:54:16,009
What?

1454
01:54:16,011 --> 01:54:17,646
I'm right behind you. Go!

1455
01:54:30,458 --> 01:54:31,891
Let's go, let's go!

1456
01:54:31,893 --> 01:54:33,094
Mom!

1457
01:54:34,362 --> 01:54:35,427
Mom!

1458
01:54:35,429 --> 01:54:36,863
Come on, Maddie!

1459
01:54:36,865 --> 01:54:38,867
Go, go, go!

1460
01:54:42,904 --> 01:54:44,604
You got any pain anywhere
besides your leg?

1461
01:54:51,579 --> 01:54:52,677
We gotta lift off, now!

1462
01:54:52,679 --> 01:54:54,115
Wait!

1463
01:55:03,758 --> 01:55:05,692
Emma, let's go!
Come on!

1464
01:55:05,694 --> 01:55:07,062
Mom!

1465
01:55:15,704 --> 01:55:17,039
Mom.

1466
01:55:17,871 --> 01:55:19,538
I love you.

1467
01:55:19,540 --> 01:55:21,643
No.

1468
01:55:22,744 --> 01:55:24,644
- No!
- Emma!

1469
01:55:24,646 --> 01:55:26,945
Mom!

1470
01:56:03,517 --> 01:56:04,719
No.

1471
01:56:06,554 --> 01:56:07,755
No.

1472
01:56:25,373 --> 01:56:27,910
Mom!

1473
01:56:53,901 --> 01:56:57,438
Long live the king.

1474
01:59:15,543 --> 01:59:17,842
Jesus.

1475
01:59:17,844 --> 01:59:20,012
Good thing he's on our side.

1476
01:59:20,014 --> 01:59:21,950
For now.

1477
01:59:23,484 --> 01:59:24,652
Look.

1478
02:10:39,326 --> 02:10:41,760
It's a brave new world,
my friend.

1479
02:10:41,762 --> 02:10:43,328
Such things as this

1480
02:10:43,330 --> 02:10:46,799
become much more valuable
since the rise of the king.

1481
02:10:46,801 --> 02:10:48,567
My men,
they don't ask for much.

1482
02:10:48,569 --> 02:10:50,568
Can't fish here anymore.

1483
02:10:50,570 --> 02:10:52,306
Everything's dead.

1484
02:11:25,705 --> 02:11:27,909
We'll take it.
