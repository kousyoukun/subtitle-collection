1
00:00:50,592 --> 00:00:55,389
他在这个镇上神出鬼没 行踪不定
He moves through this town unseen, like a ghost,

2
00:00:55,472 --> 00:00:59,601
每一年他肆意行凶
and he kills at will every year.

3
00:00:59,685 --> 00:01:03,856
布利斯菲尔德屠夫在1977年开始了他的恐怖统治
The Blissfield Butcher started his reign of terror in 1977,

4
00:01:03,939 --> 00:01:06,108
直至今日
and it continues to this day.

5
00:01:06,191 --> 00:01:07,901
一个老年连环杀手吗
A geriatric serial killer?

6
00:01:07,985 --> 00:01:09,194
当真
Really?

7
00:01:09,361 --> 00:01:12,781
别低估一个白人直男的暴力倾向 艾萨克
Don't underestimate a straight white man's propensity for violence, Isaac.

8
00:01:12,865 --> 00:01:14,658
我他妈才不关心他们有多老
I don't care how fucking old they are.

9
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:17,744
还有你的故事就是扯淡 埃文
And your story... it's bullshit, Evan.

10
00:01:17,828 --> 00:01:19,705
那屠夫在九十年代的时候 杀害了几个年轻人
The Butcher killed some kids, like, in the '90s,

11
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:21,123
然后二十年前 他消失了
and then 20 years ago, he disappeared.

12
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:22,583
剩下的就只是民间传说了
The rest is just local folklore.

13
00:01:22,666 --> 00:01:24,793
是啊 但是屠夫那会儿 不是也在毕业舞会上
Yeah, but didn't the Butcher, like, also kill

14
00:01:24,877 --> 00:01:26,003
杀了一群孩子么
a bunch of kids at prom way back when?

15
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:27,796
不是毕业舞会返校节
Not prom. Homecoming.

16
00:01:28,213 --> 00:01:30,883
所有布利斯菲尔德屠夫的故事都围绕着返校节
All the Blissfield Butcher stories are centered around homecoming.

17
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:33,927
每一年的返校节期间
And a new legend pops up every year

18
00:01:34,011 --> 00:01:36,096
都会有一个新的传说出现
during homecoming week to warn Blissfield's teenagers

19
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:38,557
警告布利斯菲尔德的青少年 注意未成年人放荡的危险
of the dangers of "underage debauchery."

20
00:01:39,349 --> 00:01:41,643
今年的故事又会是什么
What will this year's story be?

21
00:01:43,228 --> 00:01:46,523
天啊 艾萨克
Oh, my God, Isaac!

22
00:01:47,482 --> 00:01:48,984
我现在闻着像廉价的啤酒
I smell like cheap beer now.

23
00:01:49,067 --> 00:01:51,486
嘿 吧台那有些苏打水 通常都能解决这问题
Hey, there's some soda water in the bar. That usually helps.

24
00:02:11,423 --> 00:02:12,799
这些都是什么鬼东西
What is all this shit?

25
00:02:13,634 --> 00:02:15,260
吉妮的爸爸是个艺术收藏家
Ginny's dad's an art collector.

26
00:02:16,094 --> 00:02:17,763
那挺酷的
That's pretty cool.

27
00:02:20,474 --> 00:02:21,475
嗯
Hmm.

28
00:02:31,527 --> 00:02:33,070
哇哦
Wow.

29
00:02:35,781 --> 00:02:36,949
拉多拉是什么玩意儿
The fuck's La Dola?

30
00:02:38,033 --> 00:02:39,493
嘿 这东西压根打不开
Hey, there's no way to open this thing.

31
00:02:41,286 --> 00:02:42,538
你到底帮不帮我
Are you gonna help me or not?

32
00:02:42,955 --> 00:02:46,291
呃你这态度可不行
Uh, not with that attitude.

33
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:53,549
嗯哼
Mmm-hmm!

34
00:03:43,682 --> 00:03:46,894
好家伙这才是我要找的
Now, that's what I'm talking about.

35
00:03:56,028 --> 00:03:57,446
蒙
Mon...

36
00:03:57,529 --> 00:04:00,157
蒙特蒙特拉
Montra... Montrach...

37
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,783
蒙特拉奇
Montrachet?

38
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:07,623
噢 我操
Oh, shit.

39
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:11,960
干得好 桑德拉 你害我把它砸地上了
Yeah, nice one, Sandra. You made me drop it.

40
00:04:13,212 --> 00:04:14,588
真是的
God.

41
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:16,964
天啊 他们会杀了我的
God, they're gonna kill me.

42
00:04:25,224 --> 00:04:27,476
这酒看起来好贵
This looks so expensive.

43
00:04:27,559 --> 00:04:29,061
该死
Damn it.

44
00:04:36,485 --> 00:04:39,780
你总该下来帮我一块打扫吧
You know, you could at least come down and help me clean this up.

45
00:04:58,882 --> 00:05:00,509
你这态度可不行呢
"Not with that attitude."

46
00:05:00,592 --> 00:05:02,094
随你的便 艾萨克
Whatever, Isaac.

47
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:07,766
请等一下
One moment, please.

48
00:05:10,853 --> 00:05:14,314
砸门也没用我说了等一下
Aggro-knocking won't make me move any faster.

49
00:05:53,812 --> 00:05:54,980
等等我还没好呢
Wait. What about me?

50
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:56,732
你也太久了
You're taking too long.

51
00:05:56,815 --> 00:05:59,443
我那是个阴道 可不是个通宵服务的得来速
It's a vagina, not an all-night drive-through.

52
00:05:59,526 --> 00:06:02,070
我们能再来个三分钟么 我只要求这么多
Can we go three more minutes? That's all I need.

53
00:06:02,154 --> 00:06:03,864
你也太不体谅别人了
You know, that's really inconsiderate.

54
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:05,991
是嘛 因为男生都可会体谅人了呢
Yeah, 'cause guys are always so considerate.

55
00:06:06,074 --> 00:06:07,075
那帮我打个飞机行不行
Maybe a handy?

56
00:06:22,424 --> 00:06:23,800
救命
Help!

57
00:08:26,673 --> 00:08:27,883
爸爸
Daddy.

58
00:09:03,544 --> 00:09:05,754
你看到车道尽头的那辆车了吗
Did you see the car at the end of the driveway?

59
00:09:05,838 --> 00:09:07,256
没有我看到了
- No. - I did.

60
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:10,092
她最好别带男孩子回家
She better not have boys over.

61
00:09:10,175 --> 00:09:11,927
要是她带来了 我他妈就
Oh, if she does, I'm gonna fucking...

62
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,931
啊我的天啊
Oh, my God!

63
00:09:54,428 --> 00:09:55,929
米莉 吃早饭了
Millie, breakfast!

64
00:10:03,061 --> 00:10:04,521
一早安早
- Good morning. - Morning.

65
00:10:04,605 --> 00:10:06,398
好香啊
It smells so good.

66
00:10:06,481 --> 00:10:09,234
香蕉煎饼 凯斯勒的传家秘方
Banana pancakes, Kessler family recipe.

67
00:10:09,318 --> 00:10:10,402
嗯
Mmm.

68
00:10:15,782 --> 00:10:17,117
-﻿我打包带路上吃咯 -嘿  不行 不行
- I'll take mine to go. - Hey. No, no, no.

69
00:10:17,201 --> 00:10:18,452
过来坐下
Come sit down.

70
00:10:18,744 --> 00:10:20,120
让我们像一家人一样坐下吃饭
Let's eat like a family for a change.

71
00:10:20,495 --> 00:10:22,164
一家人是哦
Family. Right.

72
00:10:29,922 --> 00:10:31,089
瞧这样多好呀
See? Isn't this nice?

73
00:10:31,965 --> 00:10:34,009
感觉我们几乎再也没这样吃过饭了
It feels like we hardly ever do this anymore

74
00:10:34,092 --> 00:10:35,302
自从你们爸爸
since your-your dad...

75
00:10:35,385 --> 00:10:36,929
那么米莉
So, Millie,

76
00:10:37,429 --> 00:10:38,972
明天的返校节你有伴吗
do you have a date for homecoming tomorrow?

77
00:10:39,056 --> 00:10:41,767
我 呃 我不 我不去了
I, um... I'm not... I'm not going.

78
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:43,143
她跟我约好了
She has a date with me.

79
00:10:43,227 --> 00:10:45,729
我们明天去肛妮斯剧院看魔法坏女巫
We're going to see Wicked at the Anus Theater.

80
00:10:46,271 --> 00:10:47,272
是安妮丝剧院
"Ann-is."

81
00:10:48,857 --> 00:10:49,858
哇哦
Wow.

82
00:10:49,942 --> 00:10:50,943
怎么了
What?

83
00:10:51,026 --> 00:10:52,027
没什么
Nothing.

84
00:10:53,028 --> 00:10:56,949
就感觉为了和妈妈去个破烂的地区剧院
It just seems a little weird to miss out on a seminal high school experience

85
00:10:57,032 --> 00:10:59,159
而错过一次开创性的高中经历有一点奇怪吧
to go see shit regional theater with your mom.

86
00:10:59,243 --> 00:11:02,162
噢  不好意思 难道你不该劝阻她
Oh, I'm sorry. Aren't you supposed to discourage her

87
00:11:02,246 --> 00:11:03,413
不要去参与这类活动么
from things like that?

88
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:06,583
返校节就是一群未成年人饮酒
You know it's just underage drinking

89
00:11:06,667 --> 00:11:09,503
然后天晓得会导致什么悲剧
and God knows what else that can end in tragedy.

90
00:11:09,586 --> 00:11:13,215
哦 她明晚依旧会以悲剧告终
Oh, her night is still ending in tragedy.

91
00:11:13,298 --> 00:11:14,633
夏琳
Charlene.

92
00:11:14,925 --> 00:11:17,219
你想跟我去的 你是为之兴奋的对吗 米莉
Yeah, I mean, you want to go. You're excited, right, Millie?

93
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:19,680
是的当然了
Yeah. Of course.

94
00:11:26,395 --> 00:11:28,063
我得走了长官说有急事
I got to go. The sheriff says it's urgent.

95
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:46,498
嗯
Mmm.

96
00:11:47,499 --> 00:11:49,209
煎饼 真的很好吃 妈
Pancakes are really good, Mom.

97
00:11:49,543 --> 00:11:51,962
噢  谢谢亲爱的
Oh. Thanks, honey.

98
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:01,847
跟上了 女士们
Keep up, ladies.

99
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:10,939
早上好 米莉
Morning, Millie.

100
00:12:11,481 --> 00:12:13,317
嗨 丹尼尔斯先生
Hi , Mr. Daniels.

101
00:12:13,901 --> 00:12:15,027
打个招呼
Say hello.

102
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:18,113
你好呀你好可爱
Hello. You're so cute.

103
00:12:19,656 --> 00:12:22,784
人家好喜欢你的黑腊肠哦 丹尼尔斯先生
I love your black wiener, Mr. Daniels.

104
00:12:24,286 --> 00:12:25,287
乔舒亚
Joshua.

105
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:26,830
那腊肠狗是黑色的 奈拉
The dog is black, Nyla.

106
00:12:27,414 --> 00:12:28,540
我们走远点吧
Let's go far.

107
00:12:28,624 --> 00:12:30,042
天啦
Oh, my God.

108
00:12:32,586 --> 00:12:34,588
-我 我去不了 -米莉 你答应过的
- I-I couldn't. - Millie, you promised.

109
00:12:34,671 --> 00:12:37,007
我知道 但是她让我感觉好内疚
I know, but she made me feel so bad.

110
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:39,218
你妈的超能力就是让你内疚
Your mom's superpower is guilt.

111
00:12:39,301 --> 00:12:41,303
这下你要为了去看个挂在电线上的绿脸女巫
Now you're gonna miss the homecoming dance

112
00:12:41,386 --> 00:12:43,889
而错过返校节舞会了
to go watch some hag in green face hanging from a wire?

113
00:12:43,972 --> 00:12:45,390
拜托硬气一点
Come on. Tit up.

114
00:12:45,474 --> 00:12:47,309
就是个愚蠢的舞会 你们又为啥那么想去呢
It's just a stupid dance. Why do you want to go, anyway?

115
00:12:47,476 --> 00:12:49,186
我要给班级纪念册拍照
I have to shoot it for yearbook.

116
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:52,064
我是冲着那些醉醺醺的直男去的 他们会瞬间觉得自己没那么直啦
I'm in it for the drunk straight boys who will suddenly realize they're fluid.

117
00:12:52,356 --> 00:12:54,650
一听着有点变态那就好
- That sounds kind of rapey. - Good.

118
00:12:54,733 --> 00:12:57,152
你知道这镇上都是些什么货色么
Have you seen what's on the menu in this town?

119
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:00,656
这不是那个邮差么 -我的妈呀
- Is that the mailman? - Oh, my God.

120
00:13:00,739 --> 00:13:03,200
欢迎来到悲惨世界
Welcome to Tragicstan.

121
00:13:03,283 --> 00:13:05,160
-﻿还有噢  -噢  天啊
- And hello. - Oh , my...

122
00:13:05,244 --> 00:13:07,329
伯克到时候会在场
Booker is gonna be at the dance.

123
00:13:07,412 --> 00:13:09,414
这是你搞定他的机会
This is your chance to land that plane.

124
00:13:09,498 --> 00:13:12,251
我不想搞定他或者任何人
I'm not landing that plane or any plane.

125
00:13:12,334 --> 00:13:14,461
他几乎都不知道我的存在
He hardly knows I exist.

126
00:13:14,586 --> 00:13:17,214
你认真的吗 你他妈可是个辣妹
Are you serious? You're a fucking piece, girl.

127
00:13:17,297 --> 00:13:19,049
-哦 我是个辣妹 -嗯哼
- Oh, I'm a piece? - Uh-huh.

128
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:22,135
好吧 不管用词是否恰当 乔舒亚是对的
Okay, barf choice of words or not, Joshua's right.

129
00:13:22,219 --> 00:13:24,221
你可以的 米莉你得承认这点
You got it, Mill. You just need to own it.

130
00:13:24,304 --> 00:13:26,265
是吧连文字警察小姐都认同
See? Even Miss Word Police agrees.

131
00:13:26,348 --> 00:13:27,975
你要去参加噢 说定了
You're going. That's final.

132
00:13:29,059 --> 00:13:31,103
嘿 米莉 等一下
Hey, Mill, hold on a sec.

133
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,648
已经一年了
It's been a year.

134
00:13:36,066 --> 00:13:38,193
你不能一直为别人活着
You can't keep living your life for someone else.

135
00:13:38,277 --> 00:13:40,362
你得开始为自己考虑了
You've got to start doing things for you.

136
00:13:41,405 --> 00:13:43,031
是啊 只是
Yeah, it's just...

137
00:13:43,824 --> 00:13:45,242
没那么简单
It's not that easy.

138
00:13:46,743 --> 00:13:47,995
我爸是她的全世界
My dad was her whole world.

139
00:13:48,078 --> 00:13:50,998
我明白我真的懂
I get it. I really do.

140
00:13:51,081 --> 00:13:52,583
你不想伤你妈的心
You don't want to hurt your mom's feelings.

141
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:54,835
这也是为什么我爱你的原因
It's why I love you.

142
00:13:55,752 --> 00:13:58,922
我只是我不想你哪天早上醒来
I just... I don't want you to wake up one morning

143
00:13:59,006 --> 00:14:04,219
意识到你的整个人生已经与你擦肩而过因为你忙于取悦别人
and realize your whole life passed you by 'cause you were busy being everything

144
00:14:04,303 --> 00:14:06,013
而没有为自己活过
to everyone but you.

145
00:14:10,058 --> 00:14:11,310
干餐时候见 好吗
I'll see you at lunch, okay?

146
00:14:12,477 --> 00:14:14,188
爱你噢 爱你
- I love you. - I love you.

147
00:14:42,466 --> 00:14:44,176
米莉 嗨
Millie, hi.

148
00:14:46,011 --> 00:14:47,262
嗨  莱勒
Hi, Ryler.

149
00:14:48,055 --> 00:14:50,015
我喜欢你的裙子
I love your dress.

150
00:14:50,933 --> 00:14:52,392
谢谢你哪里买的
- Thanks. - Where'd you get it?

151
00:14:52,476 --> 00:14:54,895
我不知道
I... don't know.

152
00:14:54,978 --> 00:14:57,314
我 呃 已经买来很久了
I, um... I've had it a long time.

153
00:14:58,315 --> 00:15:00,108
我好像在伯南扎折扣店看到过
I think I saw it at Discount Bonanza.

154
00:15:00,817 --> 00:15:02,694
我那会儿去里面借个厕所
I had to pee.

155
00:15:02,778 --> 00:15:04,404
你妈是不是用了员工折扣
Did your mom use her employee discount?

156
00:15:07,699 --> 00:15:10,327
不管怎样 你看起来很可爱噢  真心的
Anyway, you look adorbs, seriously.

157
00:15:15,874 --> 00:15:17,125
天啊
God.

158
00:15:31,098 --> 00:15:33,517
噢  我的
Oh, my...

159
00:15:36,019 --> 00:15:38,021
我做了个常见的金字塔型
And I did a common A-frame,

160
00:15:38,146 --> 00:15:41,024
但是窗框上的细节是很讲究的
but with delicate detail to the window framing.

161
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:45,112
任何狗狗都会为了得到这个房子而疯狂
Any dog would kill to call this their home.

162
00:15:45,529 --> 00:15:47,197
要是你安装个喇叭
If you installed some speakers,

163
00:15:47,865 --> 00:15:50,951
放上个小毯子 它将成为终极的狗狗之家
threw down a rug, it'd be the ultimate pooch pad.

164
00:15:54,037 --> 00:15:56,039
不好意思 贝纳迪先生
Sorry, Mr. Bernardi.

165
00:15:56,123 --> 00:15:59,418
-﻿又迟到了 凯斯勒小姐 -不会再有下次了
- Late again, Miss Kessler. - It won't happen again.

166
00:15:59,501 --> 00:16:01,962
我深表怀疑坐下吧
I doubt that. Just sit down.

167
00:16:04,339 --> 00:16:05,591
非常好
It's very nice.

168
00:16:05,674 --> 00:16:08,510
这个木制品非常出色
This woodwork is exceptional.

169
00:16:08,719 --> 00:16:10,220
谢谢 贝先生 -嘿
- Thanks, Mr. B. - Hey.

170
00:16:10,304 --> 00:16:13,056
专业人士建议闹钟永远设置提前五分钟
Pro tip: always set your watch five minutes ahead.

171
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:14,349
对我来说很管用 几乎每一次都是
It saves my ass, like, every time.

172
00:16:15,976 --> 00:16:16,977
谢啦
Thanks.

173
00:16:17,853 --> 00:16:19,146
狗狗城堡
Château Fido.

174
00:16:19,813 --> 00:16:20,898
来点掌声
Come on.

175
00:16:21,273 --> 00:16:22,649
干的不错 菲尔
Great work, Phil.

176
00:16:22,983 --> 00:16:24,943
再一次提高了本班的水准
Once again, setting the class standard.

177
00:16:26,528 --> 00:16:29,072
下一位是
Next up is...

178
00:16:29,489 --> 00:16:32,034
噢 米莉·凯斯勒
Oh, Millie Kessler.

179
00:16:33,118 --> 00:16:34,620
是时候为大家展示你的狗房子了
Time to present your doghouse.

180
00:16:35,037 --> 00:16:39,458
呃我的展示得等到下周
Uh, my presentation isn't scheduled till next week.

181
00:16:39,541 --> 00:16:41,126
这里不是辩论课
This isn't debate class.

182
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:44,630
可是你说过是十六号
But you said the 16th.

183
00:16:44,713 --> 00:16:47,132
我还没准备好
Um, it's not ready yet.

184
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:53,555
凯斯勒小姐又在耽误全班时间了
Once again, Miss Kessler is holding up the class.

185
00:16:53,639 --> 00:16:57,726
凯斯勒小姐又一次没做好准备
And once again, Miss Kessler is unprepared.

186
00:16:59,061 --> 00:17:00,270
混蛋
Dick.

187
00:17:00,354 --> 00:17:01,939
有什么要补充的吗 伯克
Something to add, Booker?

188
00:17:02,731 --> 00:17:03,899
没有
Nope.

189
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:09,029
我能十六号再交吗
Can I just... do it the 16th?

190
00:17:09,112 --> 00:17:10,696
我能十六号再交吗
Can I just do it the 16th?

191
00:17:10,781 --> 00:17:11,781
大声点
Speak up.

192
00:17:13,659 --> 00:17:18,747
噢 鳄鱼眼泪可不能为你的计划不周 开脱凯斯勒小姐
Oh, crocodile tear doesn't excuse your poor planning, Miss Kessler.

193
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:33,345
我的妈
My God.

194
00:17:34,972 --> 00:17:37,766
这简直太疯狂了
This is completely bonkers.

195
00:17:38,475 --> 00:17:40,102
我都震惊了
I'm in shock.

196
00:17:40,978 --> 00:17:44,398
我两天前还在体育课上见过桑德拉
I just saw Sandra two days ago in PE.

197
00:17:44,481 --> 00:17:45,816
而现在她已经
And now she's...

198
00:17:46,358 --> 00:17:48,735
天啊 简直是个屠宰场
Oh, my God. It's a slaughterhouse.

199
00:17:49,444 --> 00:17:50,946
你在笑吗
Are you smiling?

200
00:17:51,029 --> 00:17:52,906
大家都吓坏了
Everybody is freaking out.

201
00:17:53,699 --> 00:17:54,700
瞧瞧这个
Check it out.

202
00:17:55,158 --> 00:17:58,871
吉妮是我最好的朋友之一
Ginny was one of my best friends.

203
00:17:59,037 --> 00:18:00,080
为什么
Why?

204
00:18:00,163 --> 00:18:01,748
婊子 省省吧
Bitch, please.

205
00:18:01,832 --> 00:18:03,417
吉妮恨死莱勒了
Ginny hated Ryler

206
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,210
她在外放谣言说吉妮把一根胡萝卜
after she started that rumor about Ginny getting a carrot

207
00:18:05,294 --> 00:18:07,212
塞进自己逼里别说那个字
- stuck in her pussy. - Don't say that word.

208
00:18:07,296 --> 00:18:09,173
随便啦阴道
Whatever. Vagina.

209
00:18:09,256 --> 00:18:11,091
谁会做出这种事
Who would do something like this?

210
00:18:11,175 --> 00:18:12,342
布利斯菲尔德屠夫
The Blissfield Butcher.

211
00:18:12,926 --> 00:18:15,262
他只是个都市传说他不是真的
He's just an urban legend. He's not real.

212
00:18:15,345 --> 00:18:16,805
四个惨死的青少年
Mmm, four very dead teens.

213
00:18:16,972 --> 00:18:19,183
对我来说挺真实的
It seems pretty real to me.

214
00:18:19,266 --> 00:18:20,642
他们得取消返校节舞会了
They're gonna have to cancel homecoming.

215
00:18:21,268 --> 00:18:22,394
得了吧
Please.

216
00:18:22,477 --> 00:18:24,605
返校节舞会就相当于这里的圣诞节
Homecoming is like Christmas around here.

217
00:18:24,813 --> 00:18:26,356
他们不会取消的
They're not canceling it.

218
00:18:33,655 --> 00:18:34,990
早就告诉你了
Told ya.

219
00:18:35,073 --> 00:18:36,533
万岁 万岁 布利斯菲尔德高中
Hail, hail, Blissfield High!

220
00:18:36,617 --> 00:18:38,744
喀嚓喀嚓喀嚓 我们的战争呐喊
Chomp, chomp, chomp, our battle cry!

221
00:18:38,827 --> 00:18:39,912
哟 哥们瞧好了
Yo, guys, check this, check this.

222
00:18:39,995 --> 00:18:44,124
当我们的海狸来战斗感受 我们的自豪与力量
When our Beavers come to fight, feel our glory and our might!

223
00:18:45,584 --> 00:18:47,461
唯一一个没人想碰的海狸( beaver在英语里有女性生殖器的意思)
Only beaver nobody would touch!

224
00:18:48,921 --> 00:18:52,299
你要是把她脸遮起来 还是能日得下去的
I mean, if you brown-bag her face, she's sort of doable.

225
00:19:01,141 --> 00:19:02,809
我闻起来像橘子汽水
I smell like orange soda.

226
00:19:02,893 --> 00:19:04,686
没那么糟啦
It's not that bad.

227
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:07,564
你该退出这根本不值得
You should quit. It is not worth it.

228
00:19:07,648 --> 00:19:10,108
参与课外活动对申请大学有帮助
Extracurriculars look good on applications.

229
00:19:10,192 --> 00:19:12,861
好像你妈会让你离开去上大学似的
As if your mom would ever let you go away to college.

230
00:19:13,695 --> 00:19:14,905
嘿
Hey.

231
00:19:15,989 --> 00:19:18,617
她又迟到了
She's late. Again.

232
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:21,286
你确定不用别人送吗 -嗯
- You sure you don't want a ride? - Yeah.

233
00:19:21,537 --> 00:19:23,789
她会来的 可能停车加油去了
Yeah, she'll be here. She probably just stopped for gas.

234
00:19:23,872 --> 00:19:25,749
要我们陪你一起等吗 -不用
- You want us to wait with you? - Mmm-mmm.

235
00:19:25,832 --> 00:19:28,877
外面有个变态在乱窜噢
There is a psycho roaming free.

236
00:19:28,961 --> 00:19:30,587
不用啦
No.

237
00:19:30,671 --> 00:19:33,006
我没事的边上有这么多人呢
I'm good. There's plenty of people around.

238
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:34,508
她很快就来了
And she'll be here any minute.

239
00:19:35,676 --> 00:19:37,344
我没事的你们走吧
I'm good. Just go.

240
00:19:39,721 --> 00:19:41,056
好吧
Okay.

241
00:19:45,727 --> 00:19:46,979
再见 米莉

非常感谢你们
Thank you very much.

244
00:19:51,441 --> 00:19:53,277

- Love you. - Love you.

245
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:57,406
再见再见
- Bye. - Bye!

246
00:20:21,889 --> 00:20:25,767
现在只要46 立马送到你手上
And it's yours, right now, for only 46...

247
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,783
我靠
Goddamn it.

248
00:20:46,997 --> 00:20:47,998
妈的
Shit.

249
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:52,711
嗨
Hi.

250
00:20:52,794 --> 00:20:55,923
她又在沙发上睡过去了
She's passed out on the couch again.

251
00:20:56,006 --> 00:20:57,424
你能来接
Can you come get...

252
00:20:57,508 --> 00:20:59,301
你跟我开玩笑吧
You've got to be kidding me right now.

253
00:21:20,697 --> 00:21:22,407
她将
She'll be

254
00:21:22,491 --> 00:21:26,119
她将绕过大山而来
Comin' round the mountain when she comes

255
00:21:26,203 --> 00:21:30,791
她将绕过大山而来
She'll be comin' round The mountain when she comes

256
00:21:30,874 --> 00:21:33,085
她将绕过大山而来
She'll be comin' round the mountain

257
00:21:33,168 --> 00:21:35,712
她将绕过大山而来
She'll be comin' round the mountain

258
00:21:37,005 --> 00:21:39,800
他将
He'll be comin'...

259
00:21:44,721 --> 00:21:46,223
千万不要是屠夫
Please don't be the Butcher.

260
00:21:46,306 --> 00:21:47,724
千万不要是屠夫千万不要是屠夫
Please don't be the Butcher. Please don't be the Butcher.

261
00:21:53,814 --> 00:21:56,275
我姐姐马上就到了
My sister's gonna be here any second!

262
00:21:56,358 --> 00:21:57,568
她是个警察
She's a cop!

263
00:22:01,822 --> 00:22:03,240
配枪的
With a gun!

264
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:17,379

米莉米莉

276
00:24:50,699 --> 00:24:52,326

6542请求支援

00:37:15,819 --> 00:37:18,614
我从没见过像他那么丑的人
I mean, I don't think I've ever seen anyone as hideous as that.

420
00:37:18,697 --> 00:37:20,657
带我走 -去哪
- Take me. - Uh, where?

421
00:37:22,826 --> 00:37:24,453
私密的

昨晚还发生了别的事对吗
Something else happened last night, didn't it?

425

你完全可以告诉我 我是最值得信任的人了
You can totally tell me. I'm, like, the most trustworthy person.

怎么讲真的米莉我的预修生物课要来不及了
What? Honestly, Millie, I'm missing AP bio.

438
00:38:58,672 --> 00:39:00,465
我来这不是跟你欲棒相争的
I didn't come here to clam-jam with you.

439
00:39:04,887 --> 00:39:07,014
我今天差不多喝了十瓶红茶菌了
I've had, like, ten kombuchas today,

440
00:39:07,097 --> 00:39:09,391
我得去尿尿了 等我回来的时候
so I'm gonna go pee, and when I get back,

441

And guess what, I need a friend right now,

540
00:46:09,269 --> 00:46:12,523
而你们都朝我一个劲地砸东西
and it's like, you guys are smashing the shit out of me.

541
00:46:13,482 --> 00:46:15,943
他拿了个长相奇怪的匕首捅了我
He stabbed me with this, like, weird, old-looking dagger,

542
00:46:16,026 --> 00:46:17,861
但是他捅我的时候 我们都受伤了
but when he stabbed me, we both got hurt.

543
00:46:17,945 --> 00:46:18,946
什么意思
What do you mean?

544
00:46:19,029 --> 00:46:20,948
站着尿尿还是有点酷的
Standing and peeing is kind of rad.

545
00:46:21,573 --> 00:46:22,908
米莉 专注点 -抱歉 什么

他捅我的时候 他立马也有了个伤口
So, when he stabbed me, he instantly got a wound, too,

548
00:46:30,332 --> 00:46:32,876
但是是在同一个位置左肩部位

然后昨天很晚的时候 我一直听到
And then, late last night, I kept hearing

550
00:46:34,586 --> 00:46:36,004
匕首的名字 很奇怪的
the dagger's name, like, this weird,

551
00:46:36,088 --> 00:46:38,465
就像在我脑子里窃窃私语 拉多拉 拉多拉
like, whispering in my head: "La Dola, La Dola."

552
00:46:38,549 --> 00:46:40,175
我觉得是多拉引起这一切的

00:46:48,934 --> 00:46:51,645
她手里有根鸡巴 而你喷了 香奈儿五号
She's got a dick in her hand, and you're wearing Chanel No. 5.

557
00:46:51,728 --> 00:46:54,398
没什么好大惊小怪了
Think we're past labels.

558
00:46:54,481 --> 00:46:55,691
这也太奇葩了
This is ridiculous.

559
00:46:55,774 --> 00:46:58,443
你们来瞧瞧这玩意儿 就像个软趴趴的食蚁兽
You guys got to see this. This is like a floppy anteater.

560
00:46:58,527 --> 00:46:59,570
是这个吗
This it?

561
00:47:02,614 --> 00:47:04,324
是的就是它
Yes, that's it.

562
00:47:04,408 --> 00:47:05,742
就是这把匕首
That's the dagger.

563
00:47:06,368 --> 00:47:09,371
拉多拉一把古老的阿兹特克匕首
"La Dola, an ancient Aztecan dagger

564
00:47:09,454 --> 00:47:11,832
用于献祭仪式
"used in ritual sacrifice"?

565
00:47:11,915 --> 00:47:13,750
尿完要擦一下吗 上面写着字
- Do I wipe? - There's writing on it.

566
00:47:13,834 --> 00:47:15,961
我觉得是西班牙语
I think it's Spanish.

567
00:47:17,129 --> 00:47:18,589
我看不懂
I can't read it.

568
00:47:18,672 --> 00:47:20,674
你不是在西班牙语三班吗
Aren't you in Spanish Three?

569
00:47:20,757 --> 00:47:21,842
你想说明什么
And your point?

570
00:47:21,925 --> 00:47:24,720
你应该能看得懂西班牙语
You should be able to read Spanish.

571
00:47:24,803 --> 00:47:26,972
那门课就没人是认真对待的
Nobody pays attention in that class.

572
00:47:27,055 --> 00:47:29,183
我们要不找凯恩斯老师来翻译下吧
Why don't we get Señora Cayenes to translate it?

573
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:37,733
是什么意思
What does it say?

574
00:47:51,872 --> 00:47:53,207
呃
Uh...

575
00:47:55,959 --> 00:47:58,587
德特莫先生你是有上我的课的
Señor Detmer, you are in my class.

576
00:47:58,670 --> 00:47:59,880
我有阅读障碍
Well, I'm dyslexic.

577
00:48:00,797 --> 00:48:02,174
我有医生开的证明
I have a doctor's note.

578
00:48:04,968 --> 00:48:07,888
这里说如果献祭不成功
It says here, if the sacrifice is not successful,

579
00:48:07,971 --> 00:48:09,765
两个人的灵魂就会互换
the souls of the two persons are swapped

580
00:48:09,848 --> 00:48:14,102
而变换将在二十四小时后变成永久
and the change becomes permanente after 24 hours.

581
00:48:14,603 --> 00:48:16,063
永久
Permanent?

582
00:48:18,148 --> 00:48:19,274
对
Sí.

583
00:48:26,114 --> 00:48:27,741
男生真恶心
Boys are so gross.

584
00:48:40,712 --> 00:48:42,923
噢 天啊你是认真的吗
Oh, my God. Are you serious?

585
00:48:43,006 --> 00:48:44,508
我不是个吃鸡者
I'm not a cock gobbler.

586
00:48:44,591 --> 00:48:47,010
快点 傻逼 我要撇大条了
Hurry up, loser. I got to take a dump.

587
00:48:52,057 --> 00:48:54,560
对对不起先生 我不是故意打扰你的
Uh, I'm sorry, sir. I didn't mean to interrupt.

588
00:48:54,643 --> 00:48:58,564
我 我是在找别人
I... I was... I was looking for, for someone else. I...

589
00:49:02,067 --> 00:49:04,361
怎么样
How's that feel?

590
00:49:04,444 --> 00:49:06,113
你喜欢恐惧的滋味吗
You like being scared?

591
00:49:06,196 --> 00:49:08,073
不 对 对不起 我 我以为
No. I'm s... I'm sorry. I di... I thought

592
00:49:08,156 --> 00:49:10,951
以为是
it was gonna be...

593
00:49:11,034 --> 00:49:12,578
求你了
Please.

594
00:49:13,912 --> 00:49:16,206
你要是再欺负米莉·凯斯勒
If you ever mess with Millie Kessler

595
00:49:16,290 --> 00:49:19,751
或任何别的孩子 我发誓
or any other kid again, I swear,

596
00:49:19,835 --> 00:49:24,256
我会让你这张丑陋的恶心的愚蠢的脸
I'll make you wish your buggy, wormy, stupid face

597
00:49:24,339 --> 00:49:26,425
后悔来到这世上 明白了吗
was never born. Do you got it?

598
00:49:29,178 --> 00:49:30,804
噢 天啊 你尿了吗
Oh, my God. Did you just pee yourself?

599
00:49:30,888 --> 00:49:32,264
是的 -呕
- Yes! - Ew!

600
00:49:33,390 --> 00:49:34,766
恶心死了
That's disgusting.

601
00:49:35,309 --> 00:49:37,477
你是说如果我在午夜之前不拿那匕首捅他
So you're saying if I don't stab him with the Dola

602
00:49:37,561 --> 00:49:39,605
我就要永远困在这个身体里了
by midnight, I'm gonna be stuck in this body forever?

603
00:49:39,688 --> 00:49:41,315
对的 -还有大概九小时了
- Yep. - That's in, like, nine hours.

604
00:49:41,398 --> 00:49:44,401
还是可行的差不多吧 -匕首在哪里
- Uh, it's doable. Adjacent. - Where's the Dola?

605
00:49:44,484 --> 00:49:46,195
在警察局的证物室里
It's at the police station in the evidence locker.

And he's wearing my body and he's wearing my face.

609
00:49:54,620 --> 00:49:57,289
他就像个披着羊皮的狼
He's like a wolf in sheep's clothing.

610
00:49:57,372 --> 00:49:58,957
要是我们不先抓住他
And if we don't capture him first,

611
00:50:01,084 --> 00:50:03,045
天晓得他要杀多少人
God knows how many people he's gonna kill.

612
00:50:03,253 --> 00:50:05,047
这算什么名字啊
What kind of a name is that?

613

Everybody needs a second opinion. How is the fit?

691
00:55:59,234 --> 00:56:01,820
我们这有很多尺码
Because we have lots of sizes here.

692
00:56:01,904 --> 00:56:03,947
噢 你知道吗 好玩的是
Oh, you know what? It's so funny.

693
00:56:04,031 --> 00:56:08,660
有一年圣诞节 我给我老公买了件粉色的马球衫
I bought my husband a pink polo one year for Christmas ,

694
00:56:08,744 --> 00:56:13,081
他差点晕死粉色 他那么阳刚的一个人
and he about died. "Pink?" He's so macho.

695
00:56:13,373 --> 00:56:15,792
但是你猜怎么着 他穿上后看起来可帅了
But guess what. It looked great on him.

696
00:56:17,544 --> 00:56:19,838
特别衬他的眼睛
Brought out his eyes.

697
00:56:19,922 --> 00:56:22,925
他有一双蓝色的眼睛
He had these... these blue eyes.

698
00:56:24,593 --> 00:56:25,844
他一定喜欢极了
I bet he loved it.

699
00:56:28,722 --> 00:56:30,307
一定是他最喜欢的一件衣服
I bet it was his favorite shirt.

700
00:56:33,101 --> 00:56:34,645
他一年前去世了
He passed away a year ago.

701
00:56:36,939 --> 00:56:39,274
噢 天啊 真不好意思
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.

702
00:56:39,942 --> 00:56:43,028
听听我说的话黛比·唐纳我真抱歉
Listen to me. Debbie Downer. I'm sorry.

703
00:56:43,111 --> 00:56:45,030
我不是有意要跟你分享这些事的
I didn't mean to share all that with you.

704
00:56:45,113 --> 00:56:48,200
我只是 你只是想买件马球衫
I just... You're just... You're trying to buy a polo,

705
00:56:48,283 --> 00:56:50,494
天啊 -不不不不不
- for God's sake. I... - No, no, no, no. No.

706
00:56:50,577 --> 00:56:53,121
没关系的 没关系的
No, it's okay. It's okay.

707
00:56:53,205 --> 00:56:56,667
我 呃 我也失去了亲人
I, um... I lost somebody, too.

708
00:56:56,750 --> 00:56:58,335
真的吗 -嗯
- Really? - Yeah.

709
00:57:01,296 --> 00:57:03,298
我失去了父亲 -真抱歉
- I lost my dad. - I'm so sorry.

710
00:57:05,509 --> 00:57:07,094
你一定很想念他
You must miss him so much.

711
00:57:07,678 --> 00:57:09,805
是的
Yeah, I do.

712
00:57:09,888 --> 00:57:14,685
真的很无助对吧
Nothing prepares you for this stuff, right?

713
00:57:14,768 --> 00:57:18,105
我们都被丢在那里
I mean, we're all just left here...

714
00:57:19,398 --> 00:57:22,651
拼凑破碎的内心
...to pick up the pieces and...

715
00:57:22,734 --> 00:57:26,238
我的大女儿 她自闭了 借工作逃避现实
My oldest, she shut down. She retreated into work.

716
00:57:26,321 --> 00:57:30,868
我另一个女儿米莉 她现在特别沉默
And my other daughter, Millie, she's so quiet now.

717
00:57:32,077 --> 00:57:34,997
我搞不懂她脑子里的想法
I can't figure out what's going on inside her head.

718
00:57:35,455 --> 00:57:38,959
也许她只是需要一些空间吧
Maybe she just needs some... some space.

719
00:57:42,296 --> 00:57:44,047
要一些时间去搞清楚她自己是谁
Just some time to figure out who she is.

720
00:57:44,923 --> 00:57:46,175
是啊
Yeah.

721
00:57:47,801 --> 00:57:49,928
我想我确实让她感觉压抑吧
I guess I do smother her.

722
00:57:50,012 --> 00:57:54,892
我不是有意的 但是我很害怕
I don't mean to. But I am scared.

723
00:57:55,726 --> 00:57:56,894
她就要高中毕业
She'll be graduating high school

724
00:57:57,019 --> 00:58:00,772
去上大学了 到时候就会丢下我
and running off to college, and then I'll be left here.

725
00:58:05,402 --> 00:58:06,445
一个人在这里
All by myself.

726
00:58:08,322 --> 00:58:09,698
不会那样的
But that-that's never gonna happen.

727
00:58:11,658 --> 00:58:13,911
她是你女儿
She's your daughter, and...

728
00:58:16,038 --> 00:58:17,164
她是爱你的
...she loves you.

729
00:58:19,958 --> 00:58:21,251
谢谢你这么说
Thank you for that.

730
00:58:21,710 --> 00:58:24,880
你是个很好的倾诉对象 -你也很棒
- You're so easy to talk to. - Yeah, you're great. You're just...

731
00:58:25,422 --> 00:58:28,967
你的声音太令人宽慰了
Your voice, it's so... comforting

732
00:58:29,051 --> 00:58:31,929
也非常有男人味
and... very manly.

733
00:58:33,555 --> 00:58:36,058
我知道这有点唐突 但是
I know this is awkward, uh, but...

734
00:58:37,226 --> 00:58:38,769
跟你聊天真的很开心
I've had such a good time talking to you.

735
00:58:38,852 --> 00:58:40,395
是啊 -我们几乎不认识彼此
- Yeah, it's been... - We hardly know each other.

736
00:58:40,479 --> 00:58:41,647
-我知道我知道 -是啊
- I know, I know. - Yeah.

737
00:58:41,730 --> 00:58:43,607
我甚至都还没见过你
And I, I haven't even seen you yet

738
00:58:43,690 --> 00:58:47,110
但是我觉得我们之间有共鸣
but I think we have a connection, and...

739
00:58:47,194 --> 00:58:50,113
我想知道你愿不愿意
I would like to know if maybe you would like to

740
00:58:50,197 --> 00:58:51,949
跟我一块去喝杯咖啡什么的
grab a coffee with me sometime.

741
00:58:53,659 --> 00:58:55,369
呕 天啊不
Ew. God, no.

742
00:58:56,703 --> 00:58:59,831
不我不会 -我真不该问你
- No, I wouldn't, um... - I should never have asked you.

743
00:58:59,915 --> 00:59:02,292
简直太不适合了 -我想说的是
- That was totally inappropriate. - And so what I'm saying is,

744
00:59:02,376 --> 00:59:04,253
呃 噢 不
you know, um, "Oh, no."

745
00:59:04,336 --> 00:59:06,463
我没意识到 因为我们之间有共鸣
Like, I've missed out because we've had a connection.

746
00:59:06,547 --> 00:59:07,714
你的倾诉是那么美妙
You share so beautiful.

747
00:59:07,798 --> 00:59:10,801
我想和你不止是喝咖啡
And I just would love to do more than a coffee.

748
00:59:11,510 --> 00:59:14,513
而是 而是吃顿晚饭
Um, even, even, have a dinner?

749
00:59:14,596 --> 00:59:17,307
噢 晚饭 -是啊 我会非常愿意
- Oh. Dinner? - Yeah, I would love that,

750
00:59:17,391 --> 00:59:19,226
因为我感觉我们已经很了解彼此了
'cause I feel like we know each other so well.

751
00:59:19,309 --> 00:59:21,436
你懂我的意思吗 就像是 -我也感觉到了
- You know what I mean? So it's like... - I feel that, too.

752
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:24,147
光咖啡对我们来说是不够的 但是我结婚了
A coffee wouldn't be enough for us. But I'm married.

753
00:59:25,065 --> 00:59:26,984
噢 我是个已婚男人
- Oh. - So I'm a married man.

754
00:59:27,067 --> 00:59:28,485
妈什么
- Mom! - What?

755
00:59:28,569 --> 00:59:29,736
你今天有和米莉联系过吗
Have you talked to Millie today?

756

没还没有 -好吧 你手机在哪里
- No, I haven't. - Okay. Where's your phone?

757
00:59:31,321 --> 00:59:32,573
-不在我包里 -去拿来
- No, it's in my purse. - Go get it.

758
00:59:32,656 --> 00:59:34,157
打电话给她确保她是安全的
- Call her and make sure she's okay. - I will!

759
00:59:34,241 --> 00:59:35,576
我这就去 -杀手刚现身了
The killer was just sighted again.

760

你知道我讨厌体育
You know I hate sports.

766

这太可怕了我没法呼吸了
This is terrifying. I can't breathe.

767

01:04:35,959 --> 01:04:38,170
啊哈好了
Uh-huh. Okay.

827
01:04:45,928 --> 01:04:47,804
他昏过去的样子也这么帅
He's even gorgeous when he's unconscious.

828
01:04:58,857 --> 01:05:00,192
嘿-﻿我的妈
- Hey. - Jesus Chr...

829
01:05:00,275 --> 01:05:01,818
淡定 淡定 淡定
Easy, easy, easy.

830
01:05:01,902 --> 01:05:03,779
没事的没事的
It's okay. It's okay.

831
01:05:03,862 --> 01:05:06,448
听着 我知道我看起来像屠夫 但我是米莉
Look, I know I look like The Butcher, but it's Millie.

832
01:05:07,282 --> 01:05:10,452
这听起来会很奇怪 -伯克
- This is gonna sound really strange. - Booker.

833
01:05:10,536 --> 01:05:12,412
伯克 看着我 他疯了
Booker, look at me. He's crazy.

834
01:05:12,496 --> 01:05:14,248
好了 伯克 你能看着我吗 拜托了
Okay. Booker, can you look at me, please?

835
01:05:14,331 --> 01:05:16,375
拜托 伯克 拜托了 你能看着我吗
Please. Booker, please. Can you look at me?

836
01:05:16,458 --> 01:05:17,668
就一小会儿
Just for a second?

837
01:05:17,751 --> 01:05:20,796
昨天晚上 我们的意识或者我们的灵魂
Okay, so last night, our consciousness or our spirit,

838
01:05:20,879 --> 01:05:22,422
不管你想称它为什么
whatever you want to call it...

839
01:05:22,506 --> 01:05:23,841
好吧它们互换了位置
Okay? It traded places.

840
01:05:23,924 --> 01:05:26,426
她说的是实话 -他拿多拉捅了我一刀
- She's telling the truth. - So, he stabbed me with the Dola,

841
01:05:26,510 --> 01:05:29,096
就是一把远古的神秘匕首
which is, like, this ancient mystical dagger.

842
01:05:29,179 --> 01:05:31,390
现在我只剩不到六小时的时间来互换了
And now I have, like, less than six hours to swap back,

843
01:05:31,473 --> 01:05:33,225
否则我就会永远困在这幅躯壳里
or I'm gonna be stuck in his body forever.

844
01:05:33,308 --> 01:05:36,228
你们都要坐牢了 你也是伯克
You're all going to jail for this. You, too, Booker.

845
01:05:36,311 --> 01:05:38,730
除非你帮我伯克
Unless you help me. Booker.

846
01:05:38,814 --> 01:05:42,025
省省吧 贱人 -伯克 救命啊 伯克
- Dry up, bitch. - Booker, help! Booker!

847
01:05:42,109 --> 01:05:44,319
你能闭嘴吗伯克
- Will you shut up? - Booker.

848
01:05:44,403 --> 01:05:47,281
我知道这很疯狂好吗 好几个声音在各说各话
Look, I know this is crazy, okay? And there's a lot of voices competing.

849
01:05:47,364 --> 01:05:48,991
你看到我们朋友们了 你认识奈拉和乔什的
You see my friends, you know Nyla and Josh,

850
01:05:49,074 --> 01:05:50,951
他们都是站在我这边的好吗 那明显不是我
and they're on my side, okay? And this is clearly not me.

851
01:05:51,034 --> 01:05:52,369
你有见我穿过那种衣服吗
Have you ever seen me dressed like that?

852
01:05:52,452 --> 01:05:55,122
我想说 他打扮的我还挺喜欢的
I mean, I kind of like a lot of what he's doing

853
01:05:55,205 --> 01:05:57,416
但是关键是你从来没见过
with it, but it's... The point is that you've never seen me

854
01:05:57,499 --> 01:05:59,126
我穿成那样对吧 你喜欢那样子吗
dressed like that, right? Do you like that?

855
01:05:59,209 --> 01:06:01,461
算了 不重要 听着 我现在告诉你很多信息
It doesn't matter. Like, look, I'm giving you a lot of information,

856
01:06:01,545 --> 01:06:02,921
你也才刚醒过来
and you literally just woke up.

857
01:06:03,922 --> 01:06:05,757
呼你看起来真帅
Whew. You look great.

858
01:06:06,758 --> 01:06:08,802
我 我要离开这里 -伯克 伯克 求你了
- I need to get out of here. - Booker. Booker, please.

859
01:06:08,886 --> 01:06:10,637
拜托 求你了 伯克 -不 我现在就要走
- Please. Please, Booker. - No, I need to go right now.

860
01:06:10,721 --> 01:06:12,389
你不要阻止我 我要发疯了好吗
You're not gonna stop me. I'm gonna freak out, okay?

861
01:06:12,472 --> 01:06:13,765
我不属于你
"I'm not yours,

862
01:06:14,391 --> 01:06:15,434
也没有迷恋
"not lost in you.

863
01:06:16,185 --> 01:06:18,520
尽管我渴望沉醉
"Not lost, although I long to be.

864
01:06:20,898 --> 01:06:23,817
如正午的烛火
"Lost as a candle lit at noon.

865
01:06:24,610 --> 01:06:28,113
如汪洋中的雪花
"Lost as a snowflake in the sea.

866
01:06:29,698 --> 01:06:32,701
你爱我 我也知晓
"You love me, and I find you

867
01:06:33,702 --> 01:06:37,331
你仍是那个美丽而明亮的灵魂
"still a spirit, beautiful and bright.

868
01:06:38,248 --> 01:06:39,958
而我依旧渴望
"Yet I am, who long to be

869
01:06:41,043 --> 01:06:45,088
如一束光迷失于光芒万丈
"lost as light is lost in light.

870
01:06:47,132 --> 01:06:49,718
将我投入爱的深渊吧
"Plunge me deep into love.

871
01:06:50,302 --> 01:06:53,263
抹掉我的理智
"Put away my senses.

872
01:06:53,347 --> 01:06:54,932
让我耳聋眼迷
"Leave me deaf and blind,

873
01:06:56,391 --> 01:06:59,102
卷入你爱的暴风雨里
"swept by the tempest of your love...

874
01:07:01,730 --> 01:07:03,148
做狂风中的
"...a taper...

875
01:07:05,192 --> 01:07:06,735
一支纤烛
in the rushing wind."

876
01:07:08,362 --> 01:07:09,488
怎么会
How?

877
01:07:11,198 --> 01:07:12,824
我跟你说过这是个诅咒
I told you it was a curse.

878
01:07:14,201 --> 01:07:15,285
呃
Um...

879
01:07:16,036 --> 01:07:17,246
什么玩意儿啊
What the hell was that?

880
01:07:18,372 --> 01:07:21,208
几个星期前 我在我的储物柜里发现了一首诗
A few weeks ago, I found a poem in my locker.

881
01:07:23,502 --> 01:07:24,628
是匿名的
It was anonymous.

882
01:07:26,088 --> 01:07:28,465
我也不知道我为什么要那样做
I don't know why I did it. I just was...

883
01:07:30,133 --> 01:07:32,010
我只是
You know, it was...

884
01:07:32,886 --> 01:07:34,096
只是太蠢了
It was just stupid.

885
01:07:37,182 --> 01:07:38,892
你个可怜的臭娘们
You sad fucking cunt.

886
01:07:42,563 --> 01:07:45,065
往他储物柜里放一首诗
A poem in his locker?

887
01:07:46,358 --> 01:07:49,778
你个可悲的胆小鬼
You pathetic coward.

888
01:07:56,285 --> 01:08:00,664
你说的够多了这个可以成为他新的嫌犯照
- That's quite enough of that. - This should be his new mug shot.

889
01:08:00,747 --> 01:08:02,291
嗯
Mmm.

890
01:08:02,374 --> 01:08:04,751
别乱搞了
Stop messing around.

891
01:08:09,631 --> 01:08:11,550
那么匕首在警察局
So the Dola's here at the station.

892
01:08:11,633 --> 01:08:13,385
我们得想办法把它偷出来
We're gonna have to figure out how to steal it

893
01:08:13,468 --> 01:08:14,553
然后再带到这里来
and then get it back here.

894
01:08:14,636 --> 01:08:16,095
来回差不多四十分钟吧
That's, like, 40 minutes round-trip.

895
01:08:17,514 --> 01:08:19,725
时间还是充足的对吧
There's plenty of time, right?

896
01:08:19,808 --> 01:08:21,518
呃 万一警察局里有人
Uh, that's assuming there's someone at the station.

897
01:08:21,602 --> 01:08:22,685
嗯
Hmm.

898
01:08:22,769 --> 01:08:24,938
一边在找我们 一边又要管今晚的派对
I mean, with them looking for us and the party tonight,

899
01:08:25,022 --> 01:08:27,064
-警察们肯定都很忙 -嗯
- the cops could have their hands full. - Hmm.

900
01:08:27,149 --> 01:08:29,109
派对在哪 -在一个老厂房里
- Where's the party? - It's at the old mill.

901
01:08:29,193 --> 01:08:31,278
我在这个身体里醒来的时候 就在那个地方
That's where I woke up in this body.

902
01:08:31,904 --> 01:08:34,823
他在引诱他们过去 这是个陷阱
He's luring them there. That's a trap.

903
01:08:34,907 --> 01:08:37,408
那我们最好赶紧行动了 -那她怎么办
- Then we better get moving. - And what about her?

904
01:08:37,618 --> 01:08:39,453
代词用错了 -服了 那他怎么办
- Pronouns. - Christ, what about him?

905
01:08:39,703 --> 01:08:41,078
我妈出远门了 周一前都不会回来
My mom's out of town until Monday.

906
01:08:41,162 --> 01:08:42,747
不行 我觉得把他一个人
Yeah. No, I don't think it's a good idea

907
01:08:42,831 --> 01:08:44,457
扔在这不妥 -他说的对
- to leave him here alone. - No, he's right.

908
01:08:44,541 --> 01:08:46,251
得有人留在这看着他
Someone needs to stay behind and keep an eye on him

909
01:08:46,335 --> 01:08:48,295
以防万一 -嗯哼
- just in case. - Mmm-hmm.

910
01:08:52,006 --> 01:08:54,176
啥 我吗 -这是你家
- What? Me? - It's your house.

911
01:08:54,259 --> 01:08:55,301
这次绝对死定了
Definitely gonna die this time.

912
01:08:55,385 --> 01:08:56,886
淡定点 你会没事的
Chill out. You'll be fine.

913
01:09:00,307 --> 01:09:01,767
等等 伙计们
Wait. Wait, guys.

914
01:09:03,560 --> 01:09:05,437
真棒
Great.

915
01:09:05,520 --> 01:09:07,147
留我一人和杀人狂芭比待一起
Leave me alone with Murder Barbie.

916
01:09:17,616 --> 01:09:18,992
好了 大伙们 他走了
Okay, guys. He's gone.

917
01:09:20,827 --> 01:09:23,497
那是夏琳的车 -你们待在这里
- That's Char's car. - You guys stay here.

918
01:09:23,580 --> 01:09:25,666
要是有风吹草动 就按两下喇叭好吗
Honk the horn twice if you see anything, okay?

919
01:09:25,749 --> 01:09:27,792
你怎么打算的
What's your plan?

920
01:09:27,876 --> 01:09:29,795
别操心那个了
Don't worry about it.

921
01:09:29,877 --> 01:09:31,462
我能搞定
I got this. Yeah.

922
01:09:37,511 --> 01:09:41,390
我这辈子从来没有同时那么紧张 又那么兴奋过
I've never been so stressed and excited at the same time in my life.

923
01:09:42,933 --> 01:09:44,475
标签 紧张又兴奋
Hashtag "stress-cited."

924
01:09:46,395 --> 01:09:47,938
标签 钢铁般的神经
Hashtag "nerves of steel."

925
01:09:49,606 --> 01:09:51,358
标签 她在干什么
Hashtag "What's she doing?"

926
01:09:52,442 --> 01:09:54,111
天啦 夏琳 救命啦
Oh, my God. Char, help me!

927
01:09:54,194 --> 01:09:56,405
奈拉 怎么回事啊
Nyla. What the hell is going on?

928
01:09:56,488 --> 01:09:57,990
你被看到和屠夫在一起
You were spotted with The Butcher.

929
01:09:58,073 --> 01:09:59,908
他他绑架了我们 他威胁我们载他 我
He kidnapped us. He made us drive him. I...

930
01:10:00,784 --> 01:10:02,703
我逃走了 但是他跟着我过来了
I escaped, but he followed me here.

931
01:10:03,203 --> 01:10:04,746
等等 他到这儿来了 -就在外面警察局的后面
- Wait. He's here? - Outside, behind the station.

932
01:10:04,830 --> 01:10:07,332
好 好 你待在这里行吗
Okay, okay. Just, just stay here, okay?

933
01:10:07,416 --> 01:10:08,417
躲我桌子下面 -好的
- Hide under my desk. - Okay.

934
01:10:08,500 --> 01:10:09,668
快去 快去
Go! Go, go, go!

935
01:10:15,132 --> 01:10:16,550
那太疯狂了
That's so crazy.

936
01:10:17,718 --> 01:10:21,388
但是我不得不承认 从某种非常奇葩的方面来说
But, you know, I have to admit, in a really strange way,

937
01:10:21,471 --> 01:10:23,307
这种体验也不是完全糟糕的
that it hasn't been all bad.

938
01:10:23,390 --> 01:10:24,725
怎么说 -我不知道
- What do you mean? - I don't know.

939
01:10:24,808 --> 01:10:26,560
就是
It's just, you know,

940
01:10:27,603 --> 01:10:30,063
在这个身体里 我感到自己非常强大
I felt oddly empowered being in this body.

941
01:10:31,481 --> 01:10:33,775
好像自己很无敌
Like, invincible

942
01:10:33,859 --> 01:10:35,903
或者很牛逼的那种
or kind of badass.

943
01:10:38,071 --> 01:10:39,615
我知道
I know. It's, um...

944
01:10:39,698 --> 01:10:42,075
这很可笑但是
I mean, it's ridiculous, but, uh...

945
01:10:43,035 --> 01:10:44,912
我猜当你
I guess when you're, uh...

946
01:10:45,579 --> 01:10:48,248
当你成为我这样的人
When you're someone like me and you,

947
01:10:48,332 --> 01:10:51,752
人生中大部分时候都是被欺负
you know, you've been bullied most of your life

948
01:10:51,835 --> 01:10:55,714
然后又默默忍受的那种
and, you know, sort of just put down a lot, that,

949
01:10:55,797 --> 01:10:58,967
你懂的能有一次机会体会到强大的感觉
you know, it does feel kind of good to

950
01:11:00,135 --> 01:11:02,137
还真的挺不错的
just feel strong for once.

951
01:11:04,181 --> 01:11:06,016
力量并不来自于体型大小
Strength doesn't come from size.

952
01:11:07,059 --> 01:11:08,977
不是的力量来自于这里
It doesn't. It comes from up here

953
01:11:10,020 --> 01:11:11,313
还有那里
and in there.

954
01:11:11,396 --> 01:11:14,191
而你比你想象中要强大的多
And you are a lot stronger than you think.

955
01:11:16,944 --> 01:11:19,738
你好 -噢 哇哦
- Hello. - Oh, whoa! Oh!

956
01:11:19,821 --> 01:11:21,657
噢 噢
Oh! Oh!

957
01:11:26,495 --> 01:11:28,997
噢 天啦怎么啦
- Oh, my God. - What happened?

958
01:11:29,081 --> 01:11:30,499
-卢安 你没事吧 -这个是活的
- Luann, are you okay? - This one's a live one.

959
01:11:30,582 --> 01:11:32,417
我知道 等下 -你没事吧
- I know. Hold on. - Are you okay?

960
01:11:32,501 --> 01:11:34,711
你那邪恶的小眼神吓不倒我
That nasty stare does not scare me.

961
01:11:34,795 --> 01:11:36,213
它想把我挤下去
He just started trying to buck me off.

962

为您介绍鸡眼消除霜
Well, introducing Corn Erase.

969

将乳霜均匀涂抹于鸡眼上
You apply the cream all over the bunion,

970
01:11:56,525 --> 01:11:58,485

You're home early.

976
01:12:15,377 --> 01:12:16,920
最后一班航班取消了
My last flight got canceled.

977
01:12:17,004 --> 01:12:20,340
宝贝 为什么米莉被绑在我的餐椅上
Honey, why is Millie tied to my dining chair?

978
01:12:20,424 --> 01:12:22,467
呃 她
Um, she...

979
01:12:24,178 --> 01:12:25,470
我们在玩角色扮演
We, um,

980
01:12:26,388 --> 01:12:27,389
嗯你说什么
role-play.

981
01:12:28,849 --> 01:12:30,642
我们在进行角色扮演 -角色扮演
- Mmm? - I'm sorry?

982
01:12:31,268 --> 01:12:33,437
是的角色扮演
- We're role-playing. - Role-playing?

983
01:12:33,520 --> 01:12:35,230
是个游戏吗
Yes, role-playing.

984
01:12:35,939 --> 01:12:37,399
算是吧
- Like a game? - Sort of.

985
01:12:39,401 --> 01:12:41,695
她看起来好像玩得不怎么开心
She doesn't look like she's enjoying herself.

986
01:12:41,778 --> 01:12:43,030
噢
- Oh.

987
01:12:43,113 --> 01:12:44,948
本来就是这样
Oh, um, that, that's the point.

988
01:12:45,032 --> 01:12:46,867
她本来就要表现出不安的样子
She's, she's supposed to act upset.

989
01:12:48,327 --> 01:12:49,661
对吧 米莉
Right, Millie?

990
01:12:50,996 --> 01:12:52,915
她演的很好永远不跳出角色
She's method. Never breaks character.

991
01:12:54,833 --> 01:12:55,834
坏姑娘
Naughty girl!

992
01:12:59,421 --> 01:13:00,923
他在吃我的手镯
He's eating my bracelet!

993
01:13:01,006 --> 01:13:02,716
我有点疑惑了
I'm a little confused.

994
01:13:04,092 --> 01:13:06,011
难道角色扮演
Isn't role-playing...

995
01:13:06,637 --> 01:13:08,347
不是性游戏吗
...a sex game?

996
01:13:10,682 --> 01:13:11,892
是吗 -嗯哼
- Is it? - Mmm-hmm.

997
01:13:14,144 --> 01:13:15,521
是的
Yes. Yes, it is.

998
01:13:15,604 --> 01:13:16,688
嗯哼 对
Mmm-hmm. Yep.

999
01:13:17,189 --> 01:13:18,190
那么
So...

1000
01:13:18,941 --> 01:13:20,108
好吧 呃
Okay, um,

1001
01:13:20,651 --> 01:13:24,488
妈 我没准备好之前是不想告诉你的 但是
Mom, I didn't want to tell you until I was ready,

1002
01:13:27,866 --> 01:13:28,867
我是直男
but I'm straight.

1003
01:13:33,664 --> 01:13:36,291
乔舒亚 你怎么都不可能是直男
Joshua, you are many things, but straight isn't one of them.

1004
01:13:36,375 --> 01:13:38,418
现在帮我个忙 把她松开吧
Now, do me a favor and untie her.

1005
01:13:38,502 --> 01:13:39,795
我做不到 -乔舒亚
- I can't. - Joshua!

1006
01:13:39,878 --> 01:13:41,129
妈 对不起
Mom, I'm sorry.

1007
01:13:41,213 --> 01:13:43,006
我现在跟你解释不清 但是我不能放他走
I can't explain right now, but I cannot let him go.

1008
01:13:43,090 --> 01:13:44,258
他 -不是 妈
- "Him"? - No. Mom.

1009
01:13:44,341 --> 01:13:45,509
妈妈 妈 听我说
Mom, Mom, Mom, listen to me.

1010
01:13:45,592 --> 01:13:46,802
他是布利斯菲尔德屠夫
He's the Blissfield Butcher!

1011
01:13:46,885 --> 01:13:48,929
天啊 乔舒亚·迈克尔·德特莫
God! Joshua Michael Detmer,

1012
01:13:49,012 --> 01:13:51,515
我这一礼拜工作下来已经够累了
I've been slinging peanuts to assholes all week.

1013
01:13:51,598 --> 01:13:52,599
我没时间跟你胡闹
I don't have time for this.

1014
01:13:52,683 --> 01:13:54,017
不妈妈 妈妈 不要
No. Mom. Mom, Mom, Mom, don't.

1015
01:13:54,101 --> 01:13:55,561
你怎么会干这种事情啊
How did you even do this? Ow!

1016
01:13:56,395 --> 01:13:57,521
快跑
Run!

1017
01:14:01,775 --> 01:14:04,152
快 快 快 快 快
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

1018
01:14:12,369 --> 01:14:13,787
不 不  不 去窗户那
No, no, no, no, no! Go for the windows!

1019
01:14:13,871 --> 01:14:14,872
把窗都锁上 -好的
- Make sure they're locked! - Okay!

1020
01:14:30,470 --> 01:14:32,472
干嘛 -奈拉他跑了
- What? - Nyla, he's escaped!

1021
01:14:32,556 --> 01:14:33,557
什么
What?

1022
01:14:33,640 --> 01:14:35,809
这个身体真他妈没一点用
Body's fucking useless!

1023
01:14:39,813 --> 01:14:41,899
我找不到他 你确定他跟着你来了吗
I couldn't find him. Are you sure he followed you?

1024
01:14:41,982 --> 01:14:43,567
我确定 我发誓
Yes, I'm sure he did. I swear he...

1025
01:14:43,650 --> 01:14:45,444
他绑架了我们 然后
He took us, and, and...

1026
01:14:45,527 --> 01:14:46,570
奈拉
Nyla.

1027
01:14:48,197 --> 01:14:50,949
他妈的到底怎么回事
What the fuck is going on?

1028
01:14:53,285 --> 01:14:55,037
不许接电话
Don't you dare answer that.

1029
01:14:57,331 --> 01:15:00,459
我可以解释的 -奈拉 这可不是儿戏
- I can explain. - Nyla, this is serious.

1030
01:15:01,960 --> 01:15:04,379
-把你的双手举起来 -拜托了 听我解释
- Put your hands up. - Please, just let me explain.

1031
01:15:04,463 --> 01:15:06,256
举起手来快点
Hands up! Now!

1032
01:15:11,595 --> 01:15:13,305
我要你慢慢把武器放下来
I want you to slowly set the weapon down.

1033
01:15:18,894 --> 01:15:19,895
踢到我这边来
Now kick it over to me.

1034
01:15:23,607 --> 01:15:25,651
嘿 你介意我坐后面来吗
Hey, do you mind if I come back there?

1035
01:15:27,903 --> 01:15:29,905
当然不介意 -是吗
- Sure. - Yeah?

1036
01:15:33,325 --> 01:15:34,493
我的天
My God.

1037
01:15:37,746 --> 01:15:39,498
好嘞我刚感觉太远了
Right. I felt so far away.

1038
01:15:44,503 --> 01:15:46,338
-嗯 -那么
- Hmm. - So,

1039
01:15:47,130 --> 01:15:49,383
关于那首诗 -噢 我的天啦
- about that poem... - Oh, my gosh.

1040
01:15:49,466 --> 01:15:51,635
求你别提那茬 那就是个彻头彻尾的失误
Please don't bring that up. That was a total mistake.

1041
01:15:51,718 --> 01:15:53,679
那是个失误
That was a mistake?

1042
01:15:53,762 --> 01:15:54,972
怎么 你无意间写了那首诗 然后
What? You accidentally wrote it

1043
01:15:55,055 --> 01:15:57,474
你经过我储物柜的时候 刚好就绊了一跤 它就掉进去了
and you were just going by my locker, and you tripped, and it fell in?

1044
01:15:57,558 --> 01:15:59,518
是的 就是这样
Yes, exactly. That's what happened.

1045
01:16:02,229 --> 01:16:04,106
我觉得挺美好的
Well, I thought it was beautiful.

1046
01:16:04,189 --> 01:16:05,440
那首诗
The poem.

1047
01:16:06,441 --> 01:16:08,402
大概有读了一百遍吧
Probably read it, like, a hundred times.

1048
01:16:08,485 --> 01:16:09,611
真的吗
Really?

1049
01:16:10,487 --> 01:16:14,157
是的虽然一开始发现它的时候 觉得有点诡异
Yeah. I mean, once I got over how creepy it was finding it, yeah.

1050
01:16:16,243 --> 01:16:17,828
抱歉 -我开玩笑啦
- Sorry. - I'm kidding.

1051
01:16:20,247 --> 01:16:23,000
那会儿其实我有点希望是你写给我的
I actually kind of hoped that it was your poem.

1052
01:16:24,585 --> 01:16:26,044
你才没有呢
No, you didn't.

1053
01:16:28,797 --> 01:16:30,299
米莉
Millie,

1054
01:16:31,466 --> 01:16:33,260
我从一开始就喜欢你了
I've liked you since day one.

1055
01:16:37,806 --> 01:16:39,474
你不用这么说的
You don't have to say that.

1056
01:16:40,392 --> 01:16:42,603
我知道 所以我才要告诉你
I know I don't. That's why I did.

1057
01:16:50,694 --> 01:16:53,655
我现在有点想亲你 是有多奇怪啊
How weird is it that I kind of feel like kissing you right now?

1058
01:17:05,292 --> 01:17:06,793
确切来说
Technically,

1059
01:17:07,961 --> 01:17:10,714
你亲的是一个满口黄牙的杀人狂魔
you'd be kissing a mass murderer with yellow teeth.

1060
01:17:13,050 --> 01:17:14,676
对我来说你依旧是米莉
You're still Millie to me.

1061
01:17:24,061 --> 01:17:25,521
也许 我们该等一等 等我的手
Maybe we should wait for when my hand's

1062
01:17:25,604 --> 01:17:27,231
-不比你的整张脸还大的时候 -是啊 对对对
- not bigger than your whole face. - Yeah. No, no, no.

1063
01:17:27,314 --> 01:17:29,483
没关系的 你想什么时候都可以
That's okay. That's... It's, it's whenever you want.

1064
01:17:30,150 --> 01:17:31,568
我哪儿也不去
I'm not going anywhere.

1065
01:17:39,576 --> 01:17:40,786
我操
Fuck!

1066
01:17:42,329 --> 01:17:44,456
米莉 你他妈去哪儿了
Millie, where the fuck have you been?

1067
01:17:44,540 --> 01:17:46,458
我给你打了一整天的电话了 -什么
- I have been calling you all day. - What?

1068
01:17:47,084 --> 01:17:48,544
我也有打给你
I've been calling you, too.

1069
01:17:48,627 --> 01:17:51,255
这不是你妹 -奈拉 给我闭嘴
- That is not your sister. - Nyla, shut the fuck up.

1070
01:17:51,338 --> 01:17:52,339
好了
Okay.

1071
01:17:52,840 --> 01:17:54,299
这是怎么回事
What is going on here?

1072
01:17:54,383 --> 01:17:55,759
米莉你别插手
Millie, stay out of this.

1073
01:17:55,843 --> 01:17:57,845
我只想帮忙 -我不需要行吗
- I'm just trying to help. - I don't need your help, okay?

1074
01:17:57,928 --> 01:17:59,179
-我只想帮忙 -我他妈不需要你帮忙
- I'm just trying to help! - I don't need your fucking help.

1075
01:17:59,263 --> 01:18:00,347
给我往后退
Back the fuck up.

1076
01:18:01,265 --> 01:18:02,266
夏琳
Char!

1077
01:18:05,435 --> 01:18:06,436
快跑 米莉

01:18:06,937 --> 01:18:08,480
举起手来 举起手来
Get your hands up. Hands up now!

1079
01:18:11,149 --> 01:18:14,653
拜托 奈拉他妈的接电话啊
Come on, Nyla. Pick up the fucking phone!

1080
01:18:17,823 --> 01:18:19,116
夏琳
Charlene.

1081
01:18:19,199 --> 01:18:20,826
夏琳 夏琳
Charlene! Charlene!

1082
01:18:20,909 --> 01:18:22,536
在这里 夏琳
Over here! Charlene!

1083
01:18:23,245 --> 01:18:24,288
天啊
Oh, my God!

1084
01:18:25,706 --> 01:18:27,332
给我朝牢房走过去
Start walking towards the cell.

1085
01:18:28,208 --> 01:18:29,293
快点
Come on!

1086
01:18:34,673 --> 01:18:36,633
你能听我说吗 -快点
- Can you listen to me? - Now!

1087
01:18:43,599 --> 01:18:45,100
奈拉 你别他妈给我乱动
Nyla, don't you fucking move!

1088
01:18:57,863 --> 01:18:59,031
进去
Get in.

1089
01:18:59,114 --> 01:19:01,158
拜托你能不能听我说 -进去
- Can you please listen to me? - Move!

1090
01:19:03,160 --> 01:19:04,161

1091
01:19:06,455 --> 01:19:07,873
-不 -真对不起
- No! - I'm so sorry.

1092
01:19:07,956 --> 01:19:09,583
-噢 天啊 不 -夏琳 我很抱歉

1093
01:19:09,666 --> 01:19:10,667
不
No!

1094
01:19:11,835 --> 01:19:13,962
你妈个逼的放我出去 -我真的以为
- You motherfucker! Get me out! - I really thought

1095
01:19:14,046 --> 01:19:16,715

your hamster could swim, and I'm so sorry that Regal died.

但是过一会儿 你就能想通了
But this is all gonna make sense to you later on.

你的计划烂透了
Your plan's the fucking worst.

1101

你没事吧 -你姐就是个马路杀手
- Are you okay? - Your sister's a shitty driver.

1102
01:19:29,436 --> 01:19:30,854
那不是夏琳是屠夫
That's not Char, that's the Butcher

1103
01:19:30,938 --> 01:19:32,481

咱伯克兄弟呢
Where's my boy Booker?

1107

你们不是在一块儿么
Thought you guys were together.

1108
01:19:56,505 --> 01:19:57,673
好吧
Okay.

1109
01:20:04,179 --> 01:20:06,932
你以为你现在是抢手货吗
So, you think you're this hot shit now, huh?

1110
01:20:07,975 --> 01:20:11,061
我告诉你 没有哪个女人见了我不发骚的
You know, I've never made anyone's pussy dry.

1111
01:20:11,144 --> 01:20:12,145
瞧瞧我

Wait, wait.

1115

好像没人
Looks clear.

1116
01:20:31,999 --> 01:20:33,000

你们留在这里
You guys stay here.

1118
01:20:35,711 --> 01:20:37,045
太危险了
This is way too dangerous.

1119
01:20:37,129 --> 01:20:39,464
我们不可能坐视不理 米莉
There is no way we're not helping you, Mill.

1120
01:20:39,548 --> 01:20:40,549
我们要一起面对
We're in this together.

1121
01:20:42,342 --> 01:20:43,385
还剩十三分钟了
Thirteen minutes left.

1122
01:20:44,803 --> 01:20:46,054
否则你就永远是屠夫了
Or you're the Butcher forever.

1123
01:20:47,222 --> 01:20:48,599
嘿 把你手腕给我
Hey, come here, give me your wrist.

1124

我来设置个计时器
Let me set a timer.

1125
01:20:51,268 --> 01:20:52,269
噢 好的
Oh, okay.

1126
01:20:58,317 --> 01:21:00,110
是时候去捅这个混蛋了
Time to stab this asshole.

你数学怎么样 米莉
Uh, are you good at math, Millie?

1130
01:21:21,840 --> 01:21:23,509
因为在我看来
'Cause the way I see it,

1131
01:21:23,592 --> 01:21:27,679
你有三个洞刚刚好
you have three holes, and it all adds up.

1132
01:21:40,609 --> 01:21:41,902
喝点更好办事

What the fuck did you do to my friends, you fucking bitch?

1136
01:22:10,639 --> 01:22:11,682

We'll search in pairs. Text if you see him.

1146

肩膀怎么样了
How's the shoulder?

1209
01:28:09,998 --> 01:28:12,835
实话说 痛得好
Honestly, the best pain I've ever felt.

1210
01:28:16,338 --> 01:28:19,383
那你跟警察怎么说呢
So, what are you gonna tell the cops?

1211
01:28:21,301 --> 01:28:23,303
实话实说吧
A version of the truth, I guess.

1212
01:28:26,807 --> 01:28:29,268
希望不会再有人拿到那玩意儿了
Let's just hope nobody ever gets their hands on that thing again.

1213
01:28:34,022 --> 01:28:35,065
什么
What?

1214
01:28:37,484 --> 01:28:38,944
那么
So,

1215
01:28:39,903 --> 01:28:42,155
我们之前试着要做的
that thing

1216
01:28:43,240 --> 01:28:45,450
那事儿
we were trying to do earlier.

1217
01:28:46,118 --> 01:28:47,119
噢
Oh.

1218
01:28:47,202 --> 01:28:48,203

Oh!

1219
01:28:49,371 --> 01:28:52,332
我们准备好 再来一次了吗
Oh, are we, are we ready to try that again?

1220
01:28:52,416 --> 01:28:54,084
我不知道 我看看
I don't know. Let's see. Let's...

1221

1225
01:29:22,613 --> 01:29:26,283
噢 米莉 你没事 我可担心坏了
Oh, Millie, you're okay. I was so worried.

1226
01:29:41,215 --> 01:29:42,925
他的脉搏和心率都很虚弱
His pulse and heart rate are weak.

1227
01:29:43,675 --> 01:29:45,469
我觉得他挺不过去了
I don't think he's gonna make it.

1228
01:29:45,552 --> 01:29:46,970
很好
Good.

1229
01:29:47,054 --> 01:29:48,639
太冷血了吧
How empathetic.

1230
01:29:48,722 --> 01:29:51,642
你要是见过他的罪行 你也会高兴的
If you'd seen the carnage, you'd be glad, too.

1231
01:29:55,354 --> 01:29:57,064
看来你如愿以偿了
Looks like you got your wish.

1232
01:30:09,493 --> 01:30:11,119
我累了 我要去睡觉了
I'm tired. I'm gonna hit the sack.

1233
01:30:11,203 --> 01:30:12,454
晚安 夏琳
Good night, Char.

1234

You left the door open again.

1247
01:31:54,181 --> 01:31:55,182
夏琳
Char?

1248
01:32:04,191 --> 01:32:05,192

你如愿以偿了不是吗
You got what you wanted, right?

1251
01:33:26,732 --> 01:33:28,567
你拿回你的身体了

我在你身体里待过

引发的那些焦虑

1264
01:34:41,223 --> 01:34:43,934
还要对一个醉鬼老妈言听计从
And having to take all those orders from some drunk mom.

1265
01:34:44,017 --> 01:34:45,894
啊 天啊 啊
Ah! God! Ah!

1266
01:34:49,022 --> 01:34:50,315
那样的生活根本没有意义
That's not a life.

1267
01:34:51,149 --> 01:34:52,150
但是没关系
But it's all right.

1268
01:34:53,986 --> 01:34:55,279
没事
It's okay.

1269

我们可以解决的

You know...

1271
01:35:11,461 --> 01:35:13,589
在你身体里的时候 我也学到了些东西
I learned something when I was in your body, too.

1272
01:35:13,672 --> 01:35:14,798
什么
What's that?

1273
01:35:17,467 --> 01:35:18,802
有蛋不是件好事
Having balls sucks.

1274
01:35:20,888 --> 01:35:22,014
抓住我的手
Take my hand!

1275
01:35:24,057 --> 01:35:25,100
米莉
Millie!

1276
01:35:49,374 --> 01:35:50,375
