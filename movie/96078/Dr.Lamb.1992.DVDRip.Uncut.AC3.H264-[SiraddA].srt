1
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:11,838
Stupid, I don't want to play with you.
- Don't fool around.

2
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:15,350
Let me eat your pudding.
- No way.

3
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:17,279
You're nothing special.

4
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:19,833
What's the matter?

5
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:27,674
What are you sitting here for?

6
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:31,477
Your brothers and sisters have pudding.
You don't have any.

7
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:35,953
Your aunt always beats you.
She won't give you money for pudding

8
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:40,951
I have twenty cents.
If you take off your sister's pants...

9
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:44,517
I give you the money.
Don't be scared.

10
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,591
Your brothers and sisters always
asperse you in front of your aunt.

11
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:55,912
This is your chance to revenge. My father
says every good man should revenge.

12
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:58,591
You're useless.
- Give it to me.

13
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:03,589
What are you doing?
- Take off her pants! Take off her pants!

14
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:07,151
I beat you. I beat you.

15
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:10,433
What's that noise?
- Mom, he took offmy pants.

16
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:13,269
What the hell?
Why do you bully my kid?

17
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:15,797
If you want to take off
pants, take somebody's else.

18
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:17,951
Why did you take off
your sister's pant? Crazy.

19
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:20,938
Mrs. Lin, why are you so harsh?
- You better go inside.

20
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,556
What's the matter?
Why so noisy? What's the matter?

21
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:28,519
Your son took off
my daughter's pant.

22
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:31,994
Never mind. It's alright
to show it to brother.

23
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:33,435
Why are you so exited?

24
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,358
What did you say?
Are you crazy?

25
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,790
He's growing up. He's curious.

26
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:39,400
It's yourmatter if you
want to misdirect him.

27
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:42,154
You can't ruin my kids.
- Aren't these my kids, too?

28
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:44,278
Your kid isn't mine.

29
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,755
What did you teach him?
He's so bad.

30
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:55,475
So comfortable. Be quicker.

31
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,673
Lower your voice.
Nobody should hear us.

32
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,234
Nobody can hear.

33
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,959
Turn around.

34
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,398
You sit on me.

35
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,959
So good.

36
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,709
You're wonderful.

37
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,279
Slow down.

38
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:12,158
No, no.

39
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,517
I'm coming. I'm coming.

40
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,552
It's coming.

41
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:23,114
Who is it?
It's you!

42
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:27,592
You're a peeper.
I'm going to beat you up!

43
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:32,277
What's the matter?
- He peeped you the whole time.

44
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,680
Are you sure?

45
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,353
Of course. Beat him!

46
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,115
He'sjust curious. Get in.

47
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:42,633
He's bad.
- He's a curious kid.

48
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,801
I don't care. He's not
allowed to have dinner.

49
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,674
Get in, bugger.

50
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,279
Mom, if you were here,
lwouldn't be beat up.

51
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:39,873
Dr. Lamb

52
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:58,178
Why did you pretend innocent?
- I didn't pretend innocent.

53
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,551
What are you looking at?
Fuck off. Get lost.

54
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:01,999
Mr. Li!

55
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,513
Where are the colleagues?
- Upstairs.

56
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:05,597
Take me up.
- Yes, Sir.

57
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:13,069
Don't you think there is something
wrong with these photos?

58
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,992
Morning, Sir.
- Morning.

59
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:18,121
He's the manager.
Something is wrong with these photos.

60
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,992
He reported to the police.

61
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:26,596
These photos are so terrible.
- Yes, they really are.

62
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,641
Have you seen these photos before?

63
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:31,595
I saw it few times. It's terrible.

64
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:39,393
Why didn't you report to the police?
- I thought that they're fake.

65
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,877
Where did they come from?
- From Mongkok Shop.

66
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,795
Have you seen these photos before?

67
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,150
They're awful.
All these vaginal orifices.

68
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,395
Yes. Sometimes bunged with something.
- With what? - Looks like broomsticks.

69
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,394
Which parts are bunged?
- Vaginal orifice.

70
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,994
The backside isn't bunged up.

71
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,278
When does the shop open?

72
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,710
9AM.

73
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,913
Sergeant?
- Yes, Sir.

74
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:09,671
Take a set of photos for record.
Get a report from the manager.

75
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,399
Fat Bing.
- Yes, Sir.

76
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:16,070
Go to the shop with
colleagues tomorrow morning.

77
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:19,711
Get a set of photos as evidence.
- 0.K.

78
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,717
You heard him.
Let's get to work!

79
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,760
Ifwe take the photos how
can he come and get them?

80
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,997
Ask him to develop
one more set, you fool.

81
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,156
Understand?

82
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,313
Understand? Go and get them.

83
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:37,031
Get me cards.
Let's play poker.

84
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,592
Fat Bing, do we play cards in the morning?
- Don't we have to wait tonight?

85
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:44,556
Brother Bing, do you need some help?
- Don't lhave enough experience?

86
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:50,710
You don't look like a cop.
- What do I look like? Superman?

87
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:14,710
Two pairs.

88
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:18,240
Brother Bing, you have
no luck. Only 65 points.

89
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,874
Never mind.

90
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,838
Ten dollars per point.
That makes 650$.

91
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,196
The game is not over yet.
- You lost 650$. Let's go.

92
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,836
It's not over yet.
- It's six o'clock. We should go.

93
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:31,357
Let's count the point. Brother Bing.
- There are still three minutes left.

94
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,069
You want to take advantage.
- Brother Bing, after counting,

95
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:37,353
it's six o'clock sharp, is it?
- Stop nonsense. Keep cool.

96
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:45,000
Last round.

97
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,749
I double up the point. I will win.

98
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,600
You double up the
point after seeing cards.

99
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:50,716
It's not fair.

100
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,951
I didn't double up the
point after seeing cards.

101
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:56,517
It's fairto you.
100$ per point. It's unlimited.

102
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:58,159
Show cards. I have three pairs.

103
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:00,240
What are you doing?
I also have three pairs.

104
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,993
I'm sure I'll win. Come on.

105
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,993
I also have three pairs.

106
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:07,193
It's so coincident.
- So coincident.

107
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,121
I can't win with such
a good combination.

108
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,919
I'm lucky to have you. Show cards.

109
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:14,670
Wait a minute.
I also have three pairs.

110
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:17,590
It's so coincident.

111
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:21,197
It's five minutes past six. Let's go.

112
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:37,749
Take the photos.

113
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,076
Wait.

114
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,471
These photos are beautiful.
Where did you take them?

115
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:53,916
Freeze!

116
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:58,679
Fat Bing.
- Wait a minute.

117
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,310
Police. Freeze.

118
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:02,875
Get him.

119
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,953
What were you
waiting for all the time?

120
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,760
I was waiting for your signal.

121
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:12,275
We arrest you.
We suspect you're a bootlegger.

122
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:15,712
You have the right to keep silent.
Every word speak will be used as evidence.

123
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:18,715
Whose photos are those?

124
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,853
They're not mine.
I get it for somebody else.

125
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:22,936
Whose photos are those?

126
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:25,793
A guy named Chan.
He gave me thirty dollars.

127
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:27,453
Take usto him.

128
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:28,829
Let's go.

129
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:35,074
Look carefully.
Are those the guys?

130
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:39,794
No.
- Ls it the one who holds a briefcase?

131
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:42,794
No.
- Lwarn you. Don't try to trick us.

132
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:44,558
When will Chan arrive?

133
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,555
Let's lock him up.

134
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:50,636
Bullshit.

135
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:53,440
We have waited a whole night.
Whomever you asked him,

136
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:57,873
he says "no" without hesitation.
He's playing games with us.

137
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:00,390
You're calm.
How long do you want to fool us?

138
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:02,717
Fat Bing, your instinct is sharp.

139
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,838
This is not instinct.

140
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,316
I put money in your pocket.
- What?

141
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,990
Money in your pocket is
better than giving away any.

142
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,713
Her body is crooked.

143
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:22,072
Yes, a dead body
can be crooked like this.

144
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,359
Enlarge her pupil.

145
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:30,754
According to the enlargement of pupils.
The victim was dead more than five hours.

146
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:34,676
Hello? Laboratory.

147
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:37,278
Please wait.
Mr. Li, yourtelephone.

148
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:38,751
Thanks.

149
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:40,591
Hello?

150
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,754
I come immediately.
Wait for me downstairs.

151
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,994
Mr. Li... he's in the car.

152
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:01,711
Get him out.

153
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,396
Get out.

154
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,110
Did you see me before?

155
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,599
I saw you on TV.

156
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:20,436
Which floor?

157
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:21,877
Third floor.

158
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,472
Let's Go.

159
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:31,510
Who is it?

160
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:37,756
Is this Lin's house?

161
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,678
Yes.
What's the matter?

162
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:42,759
We're cops.
Do you know this guy?

163
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:46,149
He's my son.

164
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:49,438
We have to search your house.
- We have warrant. Don't be in the way.

165
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:50,391
Get out.

166
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:52,591
Excuse me.

167
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:55,070
What's the matter?
- Your son is a suspect.

168
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,511
Where do you sleep?
- Don drUben.

169
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,993
You check that side.
- Yes, Sir.

170
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:02,756
Who are you?

171
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,560
We're cops.
- Cops? What's the matter?

172
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:07,035
Who isthis kid?
- She's my daughter.

173
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,469
Turn on the light.

174
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,677
You know how to develop photos?
- Yes.

175
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,351
Hey!

176
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,757
What's the matter?

177
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:26,555
What are you doing?

178
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,597
No need to speak loudly.

179
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,757
We're cops. Get down.
Get down. Hurry up.

180
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,195
Come on!

181
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:34,795
Who is he?
- My brother.

182
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,351
Get out.

183
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:38,790
What are you doing?

184
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,879
Cops beat me.
- You better cooperate with us.

185
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,109
Of course I can beat you.

186
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,720
I beat you, so what?

187
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:49,678
How many family
members do you have?

188
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,951
Two sons, one daughter
and a son-in-law.

189
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,791
I also have a grand-daughter.

190
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:58,275
I've got internal injuries.

191
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,119
Did you developed photos at home?

192
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,871
Yes.
- How about the color one?

193
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,833
Itook out to the shop.

194
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,310
Come.

195
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,789
Whose cupboard is it?
- It's mine.

196
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,991
Open it.
- No key.

197
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:16,831
Open it.
- I lost the key.

198
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:48,676
What is this for?

199
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,391
What is your name?
- Lin Gwao-chang.

200
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:55,189
Louder.
- Lin Gwao-chang.

201
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:57,954
No need to speak so loud.

202
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,036
Where do you work?

203
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,276
Mr. Li.

204
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:04,833
I've found something. See.

205
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,440
Sit properly. Don't move.

206
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:26,269
Take these photos back
to the police station.

207
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,435
Yes, Sir.

208
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:28,391
Don't move.

209
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,591
Do you know what you're doing?
- Sit.

210
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:31,437
What?

211
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:33,915
This is his sister.
Her husband is at work.

212
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,390
Page him at once.
Ask him to go to the station.

213
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:37,237
Yes, Sir.

214
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:38,835
Come here.

215
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:42,112
Nobody can come here
without my permission.

216
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,234
Cops beat me.

217
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,833
Don't shout. I beat you.

218
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:48,149
I haven't touched you.

219
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:51,039
I have to go to thetoilet.
My bladder is injured.

220
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:53,314
You better hold it.

221
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,671
Change your clothes
and go to the station with me.

222
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:58,353
But...
Get changed.

223
00:15:58,600 --> 00:15:59,920
What do you do here?

224
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,311
Don't shout. Go and get changed.

225
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,600
What a fucking son ofa bitch.

226
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:35,871
Excuse me.

227
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:48,996
Don't push me.

228
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:53,036
Fat Bing, bring him to the
Deposition Room. - Yes, Sir.

229
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:55,000
Eric, take the other
suspects to main room.

230
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:55,996
Yes, Sir.

231
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,791
Take them to the main room.
- Yes, Sir.

232
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:00,796
Get in.

233
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,711
Get two colleagues
to watch the door.

234
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:08,754
Mr. Lin, these photos have gone wrong.

235
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:10,550
So you're under detention.

236
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:17,159
Listen. You're confined from now on.

237
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,200
Whatever you say.

238
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:22,154
It will be used as evidence.

239
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:25,480
Are these photos yours?
- I got them for somebody.

240
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:26,556
Mr. Chan.

241
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:31,233
Have you finished playing games?
When will you tell us the truth?

242
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,193
Calm down.

243
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,552
You should have said that you
got so many photos at home.

244
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:39,269
Will you say it?

245
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,280
Will you say it?

246
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:49,232
The tiles in the picture
are the same as at your house.

247
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:51,551
Were they taken at your place?

248
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:54,915
Say it.

249
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,111
Bully Hung.

250
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,838
Yes, Sir.
- Get a deposition from him.

251
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:04,990
Yes, Sir.

252
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:06,590
Sit.

253
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:09,992
You beat me.
- Who beats you?

254
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:13,196
That Big Eyes beat me thirty times.

255
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:14,629
He saw it.

256
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,519
They beat me thirty times.

257
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:19,480
I accuse them.
They beat me.

258
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:26,198
Don't shout. Don't shout.

259
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:28,078
Take him out.
- Yes, Sir.

260
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,953
I have to accuse you.

261
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:33,431
Cops are not superior.

262
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,114
Where do you take my father?

263
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,857
What are you doing?
- L will beat you if you shout again.

264
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:39,373
Cops are not superior.

265
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:42,750
Why did you beat me?

266
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:46,074
Check his rap sheet
from the CRAB department.

267
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,076
Eric. You go to the
Missing Person department.

268
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:51,595
Get the Missed Girls
record from this year.

269
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,393
Get me the whole record.
- Yes, Sir.

270
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:56,360
Besides, Fat Bing.
The photos you have brought,

271
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:57,795
you better sort them out.

272
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,080
Don't waste time to
check if they're useless.

273
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:04,751
Keeping silent cannot
make you acquitted.

274
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,797
Say it.
Did you do it?

275
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,479
Bully Hung, stop it.

276
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,200
How can you beat him?

277
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,993
We're sorry.

278
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,799
How went the deposition?

279
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,197
What? Nothing?

280
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:18,153
Yes, he didn't say a word.

281
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,241
According to my
experience, you better...

282
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,118
I have said it all.

283
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,438
I'm sorry. l can't help.

284
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,278
I didn't come in.
L saw nothing.

285
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:29,754
I'm invisible.

286
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,670
You better start talking.

287
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:39,275
Tell me. Did he take
girls home to take photos?

288
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:40,755
Sir, l really don't know.

289
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,752
I'm innocent.

290
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,271
Innocent? You two live in one room.

291
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:46,640
How can you be innocent?

292
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,358
I never minded his business.

293
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:50,398
I work in this part of town.

294
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:52,039
He's a night shift taxi driver.

295
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:54,670
I work at daytime.
He works at nighttime.

296
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,634
I don't know what he does.

297
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,435
Stop beating.

298
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:03,275
I'm innocent.
Sir, what have I done wrong?

299
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,831
I suspect you of murder.
- Murder? I'm innocent.

300
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,514
Do you know what your brother does?
- I don't know.

301
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:11,751
He goes to his room
immediately when he comes home.

302
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,559
We never talk.

303
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:15,758
He has a toilet inside of his room.

304
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,719
I don't know what he does.

305
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,911
You brother is abnormal.

306
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,391
Did he do something abnormal?
Or he did something extremely weird?

307
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:29,313
No. I think he's normal.

308
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:32,078
If you hide anything...

309
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,798
I can accuse you.
You think about it.

310
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:41,356
He peeped dad and mom.

311
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:43,793
What?
- Making love.

312
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,239
You still say he's normal.

313
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,711
Did he sexually abused you?

314
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,118
He peeped me when I took a bath.

315
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:55,231
Do you have two wives?
- Yes.

316
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,594
Your eldest son's mother
is your first wife? - Yes.

317
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,793
Did he have a girlfriend before?

318
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:05,274
He did have one.
However, they blew up.

319
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,439
Is he nuts?

320
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,077
My son is normal. Idiot!

321
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:17,835
He likes to take photos.
Did he take lots of photos?

322
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:20,958
Yes, a lot.
He bought many cameras.

323
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,549
Why does he like to
take pictures of naked girls?!

324
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,472
Like to shoot women's
pussies and breasts.

325
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:28,319
Sir, what's wrong with it?

326
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,472
This is art. You can
see it everywhere.

327
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:34,515
Is it illegal to take these photos?
- Did your son break the law?

328
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,234
No. Never.

329
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:42,718
Mr. Lin, he has been
previously convicted.

330
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:47,914
Why did you say he's clean?

331
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:51,118
He never...
- He molested a girl in 1975.

332
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,909
Had been sentenced to
three months of mental housing.

333
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,673
He was acquitted.

334
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:04,199
He intimidated the girl with a knife.
- I tell you he was innocent.

335
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,950
Innocent?
You're abnormal as he's.

336
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:10,149
He's nuts.
I will check it out.

337
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,473
Start the investigation!
- Yes, Sir.

338
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:14,999
Sir, you have asked me for hours.
When will you let me go?

339
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,594
You lied. We have to
ask you once again.

340
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:22,070
Bitch! Say it!

341
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:25,712
Will you say it? Say it!

342
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,640
Damn! Will you be as
tough as my hammer?

343
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:31,559
Say it! Otherwise you will die.

344
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:34,435
Say it, bastard! Won't you say it?

345
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:35,959
Hey! Take a rest.

346
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:38,510
Won't you feel tired?

347
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:40,877
How is it? Did he say it?
- He said something.

348
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,714
Of course. You beat him
so hard, he won't live.

349
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:49,593
What? I'm Lin Gwao-yu.
I'm twenty-eight.

350
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:51,593
Bing! This is something.

351
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,319
Bullshit.

352
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:55,751
He got this.
No wonder he won't confess.

353
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:58,037
You beat him later.
Let's have a meeting.

354
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:00,592
Get somebody to watch him.

355
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:03,792
This is a complicated case.

356
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:08,800
In line with deposition,
this guy is abnormal.

357
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:12,195
I'm sure that he killed
more than one person.

358
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:15,598
So I think his brother is involved.
They live in the same room.

359
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:19,355
So how couldn't he know it?
- Yes, I asked his sister.

360
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:22,239
She knows nothing about it.
They hardly know each other.

361
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,193
He peeped her when she took a bath.

362
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,991
Sir, his sister asked if she can be bailed.

363
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:32,757
Her daughter must go to school tomorrow.
- No way. Ask somebody to take her home.

364
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,276
This woman has to stay here.

365
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,876
I'm so tired. I didn't sleep last night.

366
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:40,841
I take a bath first, and take a nap.
- Sleepy? Everybody is sleepy.

367
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:44,393
This is a complicated case.
We have to keep our eyes open.

368
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,597
We have to be on the alert anytime.

369
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,911
Nobody is allowed to get off work.

370
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:55,593
Fat Bing, you're experienced.

371
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,915
You get a deposition from this guy.
- No problem. Bully Hung is a specialist.

372
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,311
Don't pass it to me.

373
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:05,880
L can't stand this guy.
- I pass him to you. I will help you.

374
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,550
Wow! Wonderful, wonderful.

375
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:11,110
Most of these photos show breasts.

376
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:14,074
It's wonderful.

377
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:17,557
These are upper part and lower part.

378
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:22,280
Wonderful. It's so wonderful.
- No, I don't want to see it.

379
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:24,431
You don't have to see it.
- Bastard.

380
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:27,114
Why do you hit me?

381
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:30,918
These photos show
the suspect's niece.

382
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:33,917
I think there's something wrong.

383
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:39,315
Shit. This guy is abnormal.

384
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:43,711
Eric. Take these to the
fingerprint department.

385
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:46,715
Check it out if it belongs
to the suspect. - Yes, Sir.

386
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:49,709
It must be him.
He just rejects to confess it.

387
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:53,915
A dumb guy won't say it.
You're too soft to him.

388
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,912
I'm too soft?
I beat him very hard.

389
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:59,272
You can't force him.
You work as a cop for so many years.

390
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,680
You should do something to
get a deposition from him.

391
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:04,190
He fools around.
We will fool around with him.

392
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,151
Get in.

393
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:06,629
Buddy, take a break.

394
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:07,796
What do you do?

395
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:10,395
Bing, you really want to
fool around with him?

396
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,359
Stop talking. Go and help him.

397
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:15,476
Go.

398
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:24,355
Come on.

399
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:26,796
Will you say it?

400
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:34,229
Say it. Say it.

401
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:36,869
Hurry up. Say it.

402
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:39,712
Will you say it?

403
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,912
Say it. Say it.

404
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:47,677
Bastard, I beat you.

405
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:57,194
Say it.
Son of a bitch.

406
00:25:57,560 --> 00:26:00,837
You son of a bitch.

407
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:07,235
I will beat you.

408
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:12,401
Say it. Say it quickly.
Did you do it or what?

409
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:14,400
Bastard, will you say it?

410
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:18,070
Will you say it?

411
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,993
Hung, calm down.

412
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:22,551
Bastard, will you say it?

413
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:25,072
Bing, Bing, Bing-

414
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,837
What's the matter? Time for lunch?
- No.

415
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:32,159
Is Hung killing people?
- Hung is going crazy.

416
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,229
Leave him alone.

417
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:38,640
Damn, what kind of game is this?

418
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:40,534
I beat him for hours,
he didn't say a word.

419
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:41,829
Are you an iron man?

420
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:44,420
Stop nonsense.
How can you be so irritable?

421
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:46,354
I got a job for you.

422
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:51,793
What's the matter?
- Nothing.

423
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,753
Nothing?
- Nothing.

424
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:56,320
You go to the taxi company
to get some information.

425
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:57,510
OK.

426
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:02,509
Are you alright?

427
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:06,478
If you want to accuse
Hung, you can tell us.

428
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:09,711
What do you want to say?

429
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:12,599
L will get punishment
if I commit a crime.

430
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:14,400
Cops shouldn't beat me.

431
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:24,794
Where's your boss?

432
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:28,872
What's the matter?
- We're CID.

433
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:31,239
My boss is upstairs.

434
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:35,316
Do you get along with Lin Gwao-yu?
- No.

435
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:41,273
See, this is Lin's working record.
- Thanks.

436
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:46,390
When was the first
case of a missing girl?

437
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:49,440
The first one was Chan
Sau lan, February 3rd, 82.

438
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:51,476
February 3rd.

439
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:57,754
Action.

440
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:01,354
How about the others?
- Chan Kit-fong, 29 May.

441
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:05,193
May 29th.
May 29th.

442
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:08,911
Go on.
- Leung Man-ling, June 17th.

443
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:17,394
The fourth one is
Leung Wing-yin, August 2nd.

444
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:20,755
Action.

445
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,790
Mr. Li, it's Lin's fingerprint.

446
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:35,477
He's abnormal.

447
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:37,758
He even abused his own niece.

448
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:39,194
It's unbelievable.

449
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:42,393
Ms Lin, does your brother
like to take photos?

450
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:44,710
Yes.

451
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:46,952
Do you know he takes
photos of your child?

452
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:48,999
He didn't take photos of my daughter.

453
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:52,675
Hi! Chit?

454
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:57,394
Who took these photos for you?
- My uncle.

455
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:01,310
Your uncle took these photos for you?
- When did he take these photos for you?

456
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:05,196
He used to take me to
the park and take photos.

457
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:09,280
I have said to you many times.
Don't stick around with your uncle.

458
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:13,359
Did your uncle took these photos?
- Yes.

459
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,996
Your uncle took these photos for you?
- Yes.

460
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:21,396
Your uncle took these photos for you?
- Yes.

461
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:25,479
How many times I told you not
to stick around with your uncle?

462
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:28,751
Your uncle took
these photos for you?

463
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,834
Come in.

464
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:35,358
Come in.

465
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:38,601
What's the matter with you.

466
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:41,672
Why do you cry?
Did the cops beat you?

467
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,915
Don't cry.
You can't beat her.

468
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:47,034
She didn't commit a crime.
How can you beat her?

469
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:50,297
Mr. Lin, your son likes
to take photos, right? - Yes.

470
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:51,759
My girl.

471
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,553
Did you know he takes such photos?

472
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:57,274
What's wrong with it?
It's not against the law.

473
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:02,513
You don't cooperate with the police.

474
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:05,838
Nobody tells the truth.
I accuse you're involved.

475
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:07,519
Are you involved in any way?

476
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:10,798
No! You accuse me of
murder because of these photos?

477
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:14,954
I will accuse you.
I will do everything to accuse you.

478
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:16,754
Dad, what are you doing?

479
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:19,275
It's not the first time
for him to be caught.

480
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:21,949
Can't you remember?
He's not a good guy.

481
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:25,232
Get lost! I'm not talking
with you. Leave me alone.

482
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:27,334
He peeped metaking a
bath when he was 13.

483
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:30,040
Do you rem ember?
Leave me alone.

484
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:33,472
Do you remember when he
peeped me taking a bath?

485
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:36,553
See.

486
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:42,118
See.

487
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,551
My girl, taking photos
is nothing special.

488
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,030
Bastard.

489
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,559
Dad.

490
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:57,752
He's an asshole.
He dares to do this thing.

491
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:01,636
He took these photos.
He also took those photos.

492
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:05,559
I give you one more chance
to talk to him. You ask him.

493
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:07,240
What the hell is the matter?

494
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:09,437
Make everything clear.
Otherwise I accuse you.

495
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:15,356
Come in.

496
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:17,870
Sit down.

497
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:23,880
Sit properly.
Otherwise I will beat you up.

498
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:28,515
Everybody is here.
This is your chance to discuss it.

499
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,279
You talk about it.

500
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:33,238
We will accuse all of
you if there is no result.

501
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:35,996
Let's go.

502
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:44,553
Open the door.
- Yes, Sir.

503
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:56,312
Bastard, you get
me involved in a crime.

504
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:01,992
You're a bastard.
You dare to do this thing.

505
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:08,433
Why did you treat me like this?

506
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:13,990
You're an animal.
I beat you.

507
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:18,918
You're a bastard.

508
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:28,961
Why do you beat me?
I'm a family member.

509
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:46,076
Police beat me. You beat me.

510
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,840
You don't belong to
Lin's family. Bastard.

511
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:50,992
I kill you.

512
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:54,040
You're not a man.

513
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,758
I'm going to beat you up!

514
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:59,833
Bastard! I beat you.

515
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:01,801
You're not a man.
You should go to hell.

516
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:07,955
Goto hell.

517
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:09,833
Everybody wants me to die.

518
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:11,839
Yes, I confess.

519
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,514
I killed them. I killed them.

520
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:16,951
I killed them.

521
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:20,711
See! He confessed everything.

522
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:22,879
Useless! We need evidence.

523
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:26,400
This guy is pretty clever.

524
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:28,799
The game has just begun.

525
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:31,041
He might try to trick us.
You better be alert.

526
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:34,633
You better confess everything.

527
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:39,152
Give us an easy time.

528
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:40,755
Sit!

529
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:42,041
Sit here. What do you want?

530
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:44,753
I sit here.
- You think so?

531
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:47,636
That is Mr. Li's seat.
- Let him sit.

532
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,594
He can sit there
if he's cooperative.

533
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,991
Let's get straight to the point.

534
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:00,800
Who was the first victim?

535
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:02,958
These are the photos
of the missing girls.

536
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:10,398
Take a good look.

537
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:12,709
See it clearly. Tell us
if you can recognize it.

538
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:15,899
Don't confess it if you're not sure.
Don't keep silent if you can recognize.

539
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:17,074
You see them clearly.

540
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:18,830
I don't remember.

541
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:30,030
You don't remember?

542
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,321
This one happened
on February 3rd, 1982.

543
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:44,916
She's Chan Sau lan.

544
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,520
We suspect that
she's the first victim.

545
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,997
See it clearly.
Tell us if you can recognize it.

546
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:51,516
Don't confess it if you're not sure.

547
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:53,558
See them clearly.

548
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:56,112
Is that she?

549
00:34:58,200 --> 00:34:59,520
Is it your first time?

550
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:30,995
Bastard. What's wrong?

551
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:33,915
Don't get a girl if you're useless.

552
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:36,430
Bitch! When will you buck off?

553
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,911
Don't come back and beg me.

554
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:56,671
Bastard! What are you looking at?

555
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:59,036
Where do you go?

556
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:09,795
Kwun Tong.

557
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:30,036
Men? All men are bad guys.

558
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,279
Would you stop staring at me?

559
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:40,039
Never seen a woman before?

560
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:43,558
You bastard!

561
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:57,234
All men suck.

562
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:02,191
You can't smoke in car.

563
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:08,480
None of your business.
I like it. So what?

564
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:17,398
Hey! What are you doing?

565
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:21,993
Hey! What are you doing?

566
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:24,757
What kind of water is this?

567
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:14,635
Do you want to kill me?

568
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,991
I love you, my darling! You love me.

569
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:29,233
This is Kwun Tong.
Where do you want to go?

570
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:44,034
Who said that I go to Kwun Tong?
- You said it.

571
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:48,678
I said to Tsim ShaTsui.

572
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:54,878
Hit the road.

573
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:30,637
After you killed Chan Sau lan...

574
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:32,473
What did you do with her body?

575
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:07,318
I brought her body home.

576
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:18,713
I put it inside the sofa.

577
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:25,512
Then, I cleaned up the taxi.

578
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:35,713
Good morning, uncle.
- Hey, not so fast!

579
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:38,872
Good morning, grandpa.

580
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:46,310
Gwao-chang, are you ready?

581
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:48,511
Coming, coming.

582
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:54,150
Why didn't you come home
for dinner last night?

583
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:55,515
We got lots of left over.

584
00:42:55,720 --> 00:42:56,676
I got over-time work.

585
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:58,075
Let's go and eat.

586
00:42:58,480 --> 00:42:59,680
It's difficult to get a table.

587
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,320
Go and have some tea.

588
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:03,711
Let's go.

589
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:14,994
Throw it. Throw it.

590
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:18,671
Don't you want to throw it?

591
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:30,115
I kill you.

592
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:31,954
Kill you... Kill you...

593
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:34,434
Kill you... Kill you...

594
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:41,994
Bloody bitch.

595
00:49:11,480 --> 00:49:12,595
That's all?

596
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:18,634
Enough! Sit down!

597
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:25,510
It seem s... I was too patient with you.

598
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:26,950
Take it easy.

599
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:30,875
Asshole.

600
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:36,589
I ask you...
Did your family know about this?

601
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,037
What did you do with the body?

602
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:11,197
Uncle, uncle. I got candy.
Do you want it?

603
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:13,197
Get in and do your homework.

604
00:50:14,120 --> 00:50:17,397
You always have to do
your homework properly...

605
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:06,070
Hey, wait.

606
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:09,836
Bastard.

607
00:51:54,080 --> 00:51:55,559
You were much too dirty.

608
00:52:34,080 --> 00:52:35,514
Why did you keep my photo?

609
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:38,038
You keep this news...

610
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:39,674
Are you interested in this case?

611
00:52:41,640 --> 00:52:44,439
Not me, it's you.

612
00:52:46,320 --> 00:52:48,391
What? You want to kill me?

613
00:52:49,240 --> 00:52:50,992
I had a premonition
that you will get me.

614
00:52:51,160 --> 00:52:53,310
You know that.
But you still murder girls.

615
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:56,354
They were bad women.

616
00:52:56,720 --> 00:52:57,551
They deserved it.

617
00:52:57,880 --> 00:52:58,870
Fuck you, man.

618
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:05,439
Tell me why did you kill that woman?

619
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:10,190
I forgot.
You find the answer yourself?

620
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:13,438
OK. I will make you
remember the details.

621
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:17,915
Bing, Eric, take him
to replay the case.

622
00:53:19,080 --> 00:53:19,920
Excuse me. Excuse me.

623
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:21,230
No comment.

624
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:23,712
This is an extremely big case.

625
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:25,753
We have to replay the case.

626
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:27,789
Let's get in.

627
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:42,349
Put her in.

628
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:43,391
Put inside.

629
00:53:44,080 --> 00:53:46,435
Sir, is it necessary?

630
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:47,631
Are you scared?

631
00:53:47,880 --> 00:53:50,918
You're a cop.
This is your job. Put her in.

632
00:53:51,880 --> 00:53:53,518
OK. I get in.

633
00:53:53,600 --> 00:53:55,876
Don't move. You're
supposed to be dead.

634
00:53:56,720 --> 00:53:57,391
Yes, Sir.

635
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:07,433
What are you afraid of?

636
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:08,795
I'm not afraid.

637
00:54:09,080 --> 00:54:10,673
I can't breathe.
I can't breathe.

638
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:11,676
Come here.

639
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:12,631
Go.

640
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:16,155
What did you do
after putting in the body?

641
00:54:16,560 --> 00:54:18,520
I took it into my room
after they others had gone.

642
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:27,073
What did you do after that?

643
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:30,153
I put a plastic sheet on the floor.

644
00:54:30,560 --> 00:54:31,994
Then, I put the body on the top.

645
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:39,038
I beg you. Don't touch me.

646
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:47,516
What did you do after that?

647
00:54:48,080 --> 00:54:49,957
Then I cut it into pieces.

648
00:54:51,320 --> 00:54:53,550
I beg you. Don't touch me.

649
00:54:53,880 --> 00:54:55,234
Get up. It's alright.

650
00:54:57,280 --> 00:54:59,193
Nobody would have married
you if he touched you.

651
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:00,953
Take him out.

652
00:55:01,080 --> 00:55:01,797
Go.

653
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:04,039
Fat Bing.
- Yes.

654
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:06,550
Take these evidences back
to the station. - Yes, Sir.

655
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:08,757
Ask the fingerprint
department to check all these.

656
00:55:09,240 --> 00:55:13,279
Take these evidences back to the station.
- All of them?

657
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:15,392
Yes, all of them.
- Yes, Sir.

658
00:55:15,880 --> 00:55:17,996
Take some boxes over here.
Get some people here.

659
00:55:33,360 --> 00:55:34,509
Wonderful.

660
00:55:37,320 --> 00:55:39,550
Fat Bing, come and help me.

661
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:47,599
Helping you always ends in a mess.

662
00:55:48,080 --> 00:55:50,720
It stinks. My eyes
are unbearably hurt.

663
00:55:51,400 --> 00:55:53,357
What is it? What the hell is it?

664
00:55:53,640 --> 00:55:57,076
Sorry. it's a breast.
- What did you say?

665
00:55:57,920 --> 00:55:58,955
A breast.

666
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:02,877
Don't move.

667
00:56:03,240 --> 00:56:04,435
What is it on my back?

668
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:05,756
A breast.

669
00:56:06,240 --> 00:56:07,196
What is it?

670
00:56:07,560 --> 00:56:09,440
How can you do this?
Fat Bing, this is evidence.

671
00:56:09,560 --> 00:56:11,597
It slipped out of my hand.

672
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:13,996
Why don't you pick it up?
- Pick it up.

673
00:56:14,320 --> 00:56:15,469
Don't move.

674
00:56:15,720 --> 00:56:17,870
What is it?
- A breast.

675
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:26,154
I smell. Why are you holding me?

676
00:56:26,560 --> 00:56:29,029
Don't be scared. It's alright.

677
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:30,913
You got your own.

678
00:56:31,880 --> 00:56:33,757
Why are you so scared? Pick it up.

679
00:56:34,600 --> 00:56:36,591
That is evidence. Pick it up.

680
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:38,394
Pick it.

681
00:56:39,160 --> 00:56:42,835
Pick it up. You like it very much.

682
00:56:43,240 --> 00:56:44,992
I'm used to touch so
many different breasts.

683
00:56:45,080 --> 00:56:46,229
You only know your own.

684
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:48,152
So pick it up.

685
00:56:48,320 --> 00:56:49,881
This is an important evidence.
Hurry up.

686
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:51,629
This is an order.

687
00:56:51,960 --> 00:56:52,711
Yes, Sir.

688
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:56,071
It's rotten. Don't spoil it.

689
00:56:57,560 --> 00:56:59,039
It's slippery. Be careful.

690
00:56:59,640 --> 00:57:00,516
What are you doing?

691
00:57:01,160 --> 00:57:01,991
I help you.

692
00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:04,199
You're mean.

693
00:57:06,320 --> 00:57:09,199
You're disgusting. You threw it to me?

694
00:57:09,320 --> 00:57:10,879
You can complain...

695
00:57:11,400 --> 00:57:12,390
My back is itchy.

696
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:13,915
Will I get a disease?

697
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:15,360
You might get sloughing ulcer.

698
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:17,552
Not sloughing ulcer. It's scabies.

699
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:18,790
I hit you.

700
00:57:19,320 --> 00:57:20,549
Don't laugh at me.

701
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:21,831
Idiots.

702
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:23,914
What's the matter?

703
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:26,713
Put them against the wall.

704
00:57:27,640 --> 00:57:29,199
The others go and move the stuff.

705
00:57:29,480 --> 00:57:30,197
Yes, Sir.

706
00:57:31,080 --> 00:57:32,115
Without my permission...

707
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:33,992
nobody touches anything.

708
00:57:36,520 --> 00:57:39,353
Sit.
- Are these yours?

709
00:57:44,440 --> 00:57:46,033
Yes. Will you return them to me?

710
00:57:46,240 --> 00:57:47,196
You fuck!

711
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:49,357
Sit.

712
00:57:55,080 --> 00:57:56,036
When you see them...

713
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:58,471
would you rem ember
how many girls you killed.

714
00:57:59,560 --> 00:58:01,437
I don't care you killed one or ten.

715
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:03,121
We will accuse you for murdering.

716
00:58:03,720 --> 00:58:06,712
Say it. There's no
way to hide anything.

717
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:09,915
We want to know...

718
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:13,274
Why did you write Action...

719
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:17,154
on your shift record?

720
00:58:18,560 --> 00:58:20,361
I can prove that you
have killed four persons.

721
00:58:21,600 --> 00:58:23,796
Why did you kill one after one?

722
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:27,236
The first killing
was too cruel.

723
00:58:27,800 --> 00:58:28,870
It was not perfect.

724
00:58:29,880 --> 00:58:32,030
I hoped that the second
one would be better.

725
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:35,711
You think that it was not perfect,
so you bought the dissection books.

726
00:58:36,640 --> 00:58:38,790
He also bought a
scalpel to kill people.

727
00:58:43,160 --> 00:58:45,800
Why did you kill
people on rainy days?

728
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:48,915
Because I feel excited.

729
00:59:09,720 --> 00:59:12,917
It's raining cats and dogs.

730
00:59:13,640 --> 00:59:15,790
Come. Let's go home.

731
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:18,071
This side.

732
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:20,996
You don't have to take me home.

733
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:24,830
Bye.

734
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:38,394
Tai Kok Tsui.

735
00:59:39,080 --> 00:59:40,593
Hit the road. Stupid.

736
01:03:40,880 --> 01:03:43,110
You try to legitimate your killings.

737
01:03:43,960 --> 01:03:45,792
All you killed were prostitutes.

738
01:03:47,560 --> 01:03:50,518
Why did you kill this student.
She's only seventeen.

739
01:03:51,480 --> 01:03:53,073
How can you be so hardhearted?

740
01:03:53,560 --> 01:03:54,436
Besides...

741
01:03:54,640 --> 01:03:57,314
Why did you keep her stuff?
But you didn't keep the others'?

742
01:03:57,800 --> 01:03:59,029
I didn't want to kill her.

743
01:03:59,640 --> 01:04:00,600
Didn't want to kill her?

744
01:04:00,880 --> 01:04:03,349
See these photos.
Why did you enlarge them?

745
01:04:09,960 --> 01:04:12,873
Did you a have special
feeling for this student?

746
01:04:21,920 --> 01:04:22,955
She was so pure.

747
01:04:35,080 --> 01:04:36,275
Sai Kung. Thank you.

748
01:04:36,680 --> 01:04:38,557
Bye.
- Bye.

749
01:04:45,160 --> 01:04:46,230
You're so late.

750
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:48,149
I went to Graduation Dinner.

751
01:04:51,800 --> 01:04:54,360
What will you do after graduation?

752
01:04:55,840 --> 01:04:59,799
I want to be a kindergarten teacher.
It's so happy when I'm with kids.

753
01:05:00,720 --> 01:05:03,553
Teacher is good.
Won't be cheated so easily.

754
01:05:08,800 --> 01:05:10,711
Why did you look at me like that?

755
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:14,357
Because I think you're
pure and innocent.

756
01:05:14,800 --> 01:05:15,710
What did you say?

757
01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:22,354
Don't be scared. l think it was
fate that we met each other.

758
01:05:26,640 --> 01:05:28,278
I didn't understand what you've said.

759
01:05:28,960 --> 01:05:30,951
I hate dirty people.

760
01:05:32,240 --> 01:05:33,469
In this world...

761
01:05:33,960 --> 01:05:36,600
It's hard to find a
pure girl like you.

762
01:05:36,920 --> 01:05:37,990
Stop the car.

763
01:05:40,640 --> 01:05:42,711
What's wrong? Are you scared?

764
01:05:43,320 --> 01:05:44,310
No.

765
01:05:47,800 --> 01:05:50,189
Everything's... alright.

766
01:05:50,800 --> 01:05:51,631
Don't be scared.

767
01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:53,560
I just want to talk to you.

768
01:05:54,160 --> 01:05:55,275
Don't be afraid.

769
01:05:55,400 --> 01:05:57,960
I won't hurt you.
I don't have an evil mind.

770
01:05:58,720 --> 01:06:00,233
No, let me get off here.

771
01:06:01,080 --> 01:06:03,196
Come on.
Lust want to talk with you.

772
01:06:04,160 --> 01:06:05,559
No. Let me go home.

773
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:10,392
No. I beg you. Let me go.

774
01:06:11,760 --> 01:06:14,434
I beg you.
- Lust want to talk with you.

775
01:06:14,560 --> 01:06:15,516
No. I beg you.

776
01:06:15,960 --> 01:06:17,359
I won't hurt you.

777
01:06:17,480 --> 01:06:19,391
Let me go. I beg you.

778
01:06:19,880 --> 01:06:21,791
Come on.
- Let me go!

779
01:06:24,440 --> 01:06:26,397
Let me go. Let me go.

780
01:06:26,720 --> 01:06:28,791
Help! Help!

781
01:06:28,880 --> 01:06:30,632
Don't scream! Stop it!

782
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:40,232
I don't have an evil mind.

783
01:06:48,120 --> 01:06:49,269
I'm sorry.

784
01:06:50,720 --> 01:06:52,996
Did I hurt you?

785
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:57,638
You're so pure.

786
01:07:38,720 --> 01:07:39,835
I believe in fate.

787
01:07:41,520 --> 01:07:43,557
This is our first time
to meet each other.

788
01:07:44,320 --> 01:07:47,199
It must be fate that
we can befriends.

789
01:07:48,520 --> 01:07:50,113
I also believe in justice.

790
01:07:51,160 --> 01:07:55,119
A pure girl like you must
get a good judgment.

791
01:07:56,040 --> 01:07:58,793
You too. You're a good man.

792
01:07:59,400 --> 01:08:01,311
You will be happy in the future.

793
01:08:02,960 --> 01:08:05,634
No. I'm not happy.

794
01:08:06,520 --> 01:08:08,193
Because nobody understands me.

795
01:08:09,920 --> 01:08:11,035
I understand you.

796
01:08:12,280 --> 01:08:15,636
In this world,
I believe in three persons.

797
01:08:16,520 --> 01:08:19,751
The first one is God.
Second one is my mother.

798
01:08:20,080 --> 01:08:22,196
The third one is myself.

799
01:08:28,560 --> 01:08:31,996
You're too young.
You won't understand.

800
01:08:32,400 --> 01:08:35,279
Yes. My mother worries about me.

801
01:08:38,040 --> 01:08:39,758
You better let me go home.

802
01:08:42,840 --> 01:08:44,911
I talk with you tomorrow.

803
01:08:48,080 --> 01:08:49,036
You're a good girl.

804
01:09:43,680 --> 01:09:45,114
Some music?

805
01:10:31,080 --> 01:10:32,309
Where are you going?

806
01:10:33,880 --> 01:10:36,793
Let me go!
Let me go!

807
01:10:37,560 --> 01:10:38,755
Come in.

808
01:10:41,720 --> 01:10:42,755
Come in.

809
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:46,035
No.

810
01:11:57,280 --> 01:11:58,953
Help!

811
01:12:01,520 --> 01:12:02,669
Please help me!

812
01:12:03,840 --> 01:12:05,239
Don't care about her. Let's go.

813
01:12:05,480 --> 01:12:07,153
Don't go away. Help!

814
01:12:07,640 --> 01:12:10,598
Help! Don't go.

815
01:12:31,720 --> 01:12:32,915
No.

816
01:12:39,880 --> 01:12:41,154
No.

817
01:12:47,280 --> 01:12:50,159
Open the door! Help!

818
01:12:50,800 --> 01:12:53,189
Help! Open the door.

819
01:13:06,400 --> 01:13:08,550
Open the door! Help!

820
01:13:09,960 --> 01:13:12,110
Open the door! Help!

821
01:13:13,440 --> 01:13:14,510
Help!

822
01:13:31,800 --> 01:13:32,640
Why did you run away?

823
01:13:32,960 --> 01:13:36,316
Why? Why did you run away?

824
01:13:41,760 --> 01:13:44,912
Why did you run away?

825
01:14:01,560 --> 01:14:08,637
Don't sleep! Please, don't sleep!
Talk to me... Talk to me!

826
01:14:16,160 --> 01:14:17,195
What are you doing?

827
01:14:17,560 --> 01:14:19,358
Don't create such mysteries.

828
01:14:19,480 --> 01:14:20,231
Sit.

829
01:14:28,080 --> 01:14:29,150
Why didn't you go on?

830
01:14:29,800 --> 01:14:31,120
Do you want to hide something?

831
01:14:31,400 --> 01:14:34,711
You better cooperate with us.
I want to finish work earlier.

832
01:14:36,360 --> 01:14:38,556
Mr. Li, we discovered
something. Have a look.

833
01:15:08,800 --> 01:15:13,590
Shit! What a son of a bitch!
- A fucking animal.

834
01:15:43,960 --> 01:15:46,600
Why did you run away?

835
01:15:46,880 --> 01:15:48,029
I wouldn't have hurt you.

836
01:15:48,720 --> 01:15:51,439
You're pure and innocent.

837
01:15:52,400 --> 01:15:53,754
I want to marry you.

838
01:15:54,640 --> 01:15:56,870
I suppose you agree
if you keep silent.

839
01:15:57,640 --> 01:16:00,678
I will treat you very well.

840
01:19:02,080 --> 01:19:03,832
You're pure and innocent.

841
01:19:24,080 --> 01:19:26,913
We're both virgins.

842
01:19:28,240 --> 01:19:30,277
Our marriage is perfect.

843
01:20:35,640 --> 01:20:39,429
Damn! Man! Such a son of a bitch!

844
01:20:41,920 --> 01:20:46,517
Bastard! He raped
her almost half an hour.

845
01:20:48,080 --> 01:20:49,878
More than that! It's forty minutes.

846
01:20:53,800 --> 01:20:56,440

You go. I will stay here.

860
01:21:54,560 --> 01:21:55,914
Why me? I go there every time.

861
01:21:56,320 --> 01:21:57,390
What's wrong with it?

862
01:21:57,560 --> 01:21:58,675
I'm not familiar with him.

863
01:21:58,880 --> 01:22:00,837
Please make a trip with Mr. Li.

864
01:22:01,480 --> 01:22:03,471
I go this time.
- OK.

865
01:22:05,640 --> 01:22:06,596
Mr. Li, this side.

866
01:22:20,960 --> 01:22:22,758
Mr. Li, he's in the last one.

867
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:27,560
Sir, do you have a cigarette?

868
01:22:27,880 --> 01:22:28,836
Give it to me.

869

Please give me a cigarette.

01:22:33,120 --> 01:22:34,474
Give one-to me.

871
01:22:34,880 --> 01:22:36,951
Give me. Sir.

872
01:22:37,360 --> 01:22:39,158
Come on... only one!

873
01:22:42,640 --> 01:22:45,792
Mister, do you have a cigarette?

874
01:22:46,560 --> 01:22:47,959
Do you have a cigarette?

875
01:23:11,360 --> 01:23:14,591
This is the result of your evil deeds.
You will stay here until till death.

I want to get back my
photos and video tapes.

879
01:23:31,160 --> 01:23:33,834
I'm sorry. That's impossible.

880
01:23:37,920 --> 01:23:39,558
You're just wasting my time.
