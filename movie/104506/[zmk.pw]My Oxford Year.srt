00:09:54,791 --> 00:09:55,625
Hi.

162
00:09:56,666 --> 00:10:03,375
Uh, ladies and gentlemen,
we have a student here all the way from...

163
00:10:04,541 --> 00:10:07,875
- New York.
- New York, New York. Welcome, welcome.

164
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:12,416
I notice you don't have any cake.
We have to make you feel at home.

165
00:10:13,833 --> 00:10:15,958
And they do say that everything

166
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:17,958
is bigger in New York.

167
00:10:18,625 --> 00:10:20,499
Actually, that's Texas.

168
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:22,125
[taps table] Either way.

169
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:28,082
- I don't really want the cake.
- Don't want the cake?

170
00:10:28,083 --> 00:10:30,040
- [Anna] No.
- Fine. Yeah.

171
00:10:30,041 --> 00:10:33,540
It's just that Mrs. Mackenzie crafted it
in our very own college kitchen,

172
00:10:33,541 --> 00:10:35,707
so it's basically an insult
to the college,

173
00:10:35,708 --> 00:10:37,124
everyone here, and all of Oxford--

174
00:10:37,125 --> 00:10:39,749
- I'm going to eat it.
- I'm not gonna force you to eat it.

175
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:41,290
- It's slightly unusual--
- I want it.

176
00:10:41,291 --> 00:10:42,958
- I know you do, but--
- I insist.

177
00:10:54,875 --> 00:10:55,750
Mmm.

178
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,250
[muffled] It's delicious.

179
00:11:02,458 --> 00:11:04,249
[Jamie] Good. So, poetry.

180
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:08,040
I liked poetry, but, I mean,
Victorian poetry, that's for my dad.

181
00:11:08,041 --> 00:11:11,124
Stale old men in top hats
banging on about the glory of foreign wars

182
00:11:11,125 --> 00:11:14,750
might not be the most exciting thing
in the world, but

183
00:11:15,666 --> 00:11:17,874
never in my wildest dreams

184
00:11:17,875 --> 00:11:21,083
did I expect to find
in the work of the Victorians

185
00:11:21,583 --> 00:11:24,165
such... despair,

186
00:11:24,166 --> 00:11:26,832
such terror, such beauty,

187
00:11:26,833 --> 00:11:28,708
wisdom, lust.

188
00:11:29,208 --> 00:11:31,332
If you don't mind,

189
00:11:31,333 --> 00:11:33,832
I would love it if you read us this poem.

190
00:11:33,833 --> 00:11:36,207
It was written by an American,

191
00:11:36,208 --> 00:11:40,875
so I think we'd all like it
if we heard it in the original cadence.

192
00:11:43,416 --> 00:11:44,708
[clears throat]

193
00:11:46,791 --> 00:11:49,000
<i>"My candle burns at both ends</i>

194
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:51,375
<i>It will not last the night</i>

195
00:11:52,083 --> 00:11:55,125
<i>But, ah, my foes, and, oh, my friends</i>

196
00:11:55,958 --> 00:11:57,458
<i>It gives a lovely light"</i>

197
00:12:00,458 --> 00:12:01,333
Thank you.

198
00:12:02,458 --> 00:12:04,665
That was Edna St. Vincent Millay.

199
00:12:04,666 --> 00:12:07,457
There are many different
interpretations of those words,

200
00:12:07,458 --> 00:12:08,665
but here's my tuppence worth.

201
00:12:08,666 --> 00:12:12,874
I believe that what she is saying is that
a well-lived life might come at a price,

202
00:12:12,875 --> 00:12:15,625
but bugger me
if it's not worth every penny.

203
00:12:16,416 --> 00:12:17,957
Nothing is permanent.

204
00:12:17,958 --> 00:12:21,082
Our passions, our loves,
or indeed our lives

205
00:12:21,083 --> 00:12:23,665
might indeed be fleeting,

206
00:12:23,666 --> 00:12:29,125
but if, while we have the chance,
we embrace them fully,

207
00:12:29,625 --> 00:12:31,749
then we can say that we have truly lived.

208
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:37,374
Poetry... Poetry can be taught,
but, really, it should be tried.

209
00:12:37,375 --> 00:12:40,999
It should be tested.
It should be engaged with.

210
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,041
Take it on. Allow it to change your life.

211
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:50,333
And so, in that vein, I will endeavor
to teach you but one thing in my class.

212
00:12:50,833 --> 00:12:52,791
Can anyone guess what it might be?

213
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:57,625
To eat cake?

214
00:13:01,333 --> 00:13:02,625
Every chance you get.

215
00:13:05,875 --> 00:13:09,375
Uh, ping them in an email to me,
and we can, uh, schedule a tute.

216
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:12,290
[girl laughs] Yeah. So...

217
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:13,500
Uh, can I have a word?

218
00:13:21,583 --> 00:13:23,583
So you're my American MA scholar.

219
00:13:24,083 --> 00:13:26,625
And you're not the professor
I came to see.

220
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:30,040
Uh, no, but, uh, I'm only covering
for Professor Styan

221
00:13:30,041 --> 00:13:31,665
when she can't be bothered.

222
00:13:31,666 --> 00:13:34,166
She's very lazy, actually.
Sorry to disappoint.

223
00:13:34,875 --> 00:13:36,000
I am disappointed.

224
00:13:39,583 --> 00:13:40,874
- So, the other day...
- Hmm.

225
00:13:40,875 --> 00:13:42,040
Um...

226
00:13:42,041 --> 00:13:46,666
- I don't normally hide in chip shops.
- And drench people with puddles.

227
00:13:47,625 --> 00:13:48,875
Terrible mistake.

228
00:13:49,416 --> 00:13:51,374
Truly, I... I had absolutely no intention

229
00:13:51,375 --> 00:13:55,541
of starting an impromptu
wet T-shirt competition.

230
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:58,500
But if I did, then you'd win.

231
00:14:00,083 --> 00:14:02,374
Shouldn't be discussing
wet T-shirt competitions.

232
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:03,500
Never been to one.

233
00:14:04,041 --> 00:14:04,916
Obviously.

234
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,125
Um... Once...

235
00:14:10,458 --> 00:14:11,958
I'm actually very mature.

236
00:14:13,583 --> 00:14:15,666
Oh, well, that is very reassuring.

237
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:21,165
- So am I.
- Congratulations, <i>Professor</i> Davenport.

238
00:14:21,166 --> 00:14:23,666
- Your first class.
- Uh, would you like some cake?

239
00:14:24,166 --> 00:14:27,249
No, of course not. When was the last time
you saw me eat cake?

240
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:28,583
[Jamie] My birthday?

241
00:14:31,708 --> 00:14:33,000
[whimsical music playing]

242
00:14:37,291 --> 00:14:38,208
[Maggie] Anna!

243
00:14:38,708 --> 00:14:39,832
Hey.

244
00:14:39,833 --> 00:14:42,040
Flirting with the hot teacher
on the first day?

245
00:14:42,041 --> 00:14:44,207
- What? No! I, uh--
- Oh, no, I love it.

246
00:14:44,208 --> 00:14:45,707
Have you got a bike?

247
00:14:45,708 --> 00:14:46,624
I have not.

248
00:14:46,625 --> 00:14:48,749
[Maggie] You can't be in Oxford
and not have a bike.

249
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:51,625
Right, get on. I know a man.

250
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:54,124
- Is it safe?
- Oh, I wouldn't have thought so.

251
00:14:54,125 --> 00:14:55,458
[mouths] It's not.

252
00:14:56,708 --> 00:14:58,457
I think I'll... I'll follow you.

253
00:14:58,458 --> 00:15:00,375
[Maggie] Well, I hope you're quick.

254
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
[Charlie] Good luck.

255
00:15:02,791 --> 00:15:04,708
Oh. Maggie! [chuckles]

256
00:15:05,291 --> 00:15:07,291
[optimistic music playing]

257
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:16,874
Coming!

258
00:15:16,875 --> 00:15:19,374
- [thud]
- [yells] Mother of God!

259
00:15:19,375 --> 00:15:21,332
Oh God, not again.

260
00:15:21,333 --> 00:15:22,750
Oh, my...

261
00:15:23,416 --> 00:15:25,582
Hello, Tom. Everything all right?

262
00:15:25,583 --> 00:15:28,457
Dropped a bloody copy of Hargreaves'
medical ailments on my metatarsal.

263
00:15:28,458 --> 00:15:30,208
Ouch. The irony.

264
00:15:30,708 --> 00:15:32,874
Well, this is Anna. She's from America.

265
00:15:32,875 --> 00:15:35,583
Anna, which are we destined to be?
Friends or lovers?

266
00:15:36,375 --> 00:15:38,374
- Friends.
- Absolutely sure?

267
00:15:38,375 --> 00:15:39,832
- Positive.
- 100%?

268
00:15:39,833 --> 00:15:42,041
- Friends.
- Wow. Cold.

269
00:15:42,833 --> 00:15:44,582
The best ones
are always the cruelest. Right?

270
00:15:44,583 --> 00:15:46,457
- Not always.
- [Tom] Come in.

271
00:15:46,458 --> 00:15:47,540
[Maggie laughs]

272
00:15:47,541 --> 00:15:49,333
[joyful music playing]

273
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:52,416
- Hey, have you got that book I lent--
- [Tom] No!

274
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:00,457
Wow.

275
00:16:00,458 --> 00:16:01,500
[Tom] Here she is.

276
00:16:03,125 --> 00:16:04,374
The Duchess.

277
00:16:04,375 --> 00:16:08,207
Okay. Wow. She is so... so British.

278
00:16:08,208 --> 00:16:11,582
- Which is... a good thing?
- Oh, yeah.

279
00:16:11,583 --> 00:16:15,415
If it's British you're after, then I have
the perfect evening of entertainment.

280
00:16:15,416 --> 00:16:17,457
[Anna Richardson] <i>Welcome
to</i> Naked Attraction<i>,</i>

281
00:16:17,458 --> 00:16:19,915
<i>the dating show
that likes to let it all hang out.</i>

282
00:16:19,916 --> 00:16:23,165
It's funny. It's classic. So subversive.

283
00:16:23,166 --> 00:16:26,040
She's right. You know,
<i>Naked Attraction</i> is subversive.

284
00:16:26,041 --> 00:16:29,458
Oh, no, I meant "A Man's Requirements"
by Elizabeth Barrett Browning.

285
00:16:30,166 --> 00:16:30,999
Listen.

As a man is able"</i>

288
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:41,957
Uh... How is that subversive?

289
00:16:41,958 --> 00:16:44,457
She calls out
the arrested development man whore

290
00:16:44,458 --> 00:16:45,500
in the 1800s.

291
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:49,833
It's brilliant.
It's perfect for Professor Davenport.

292
00:16:50,541 --> 00:16:51,833
I'm gonna go send it.

293
00:16:54,083 --> 00:16:57,875
My God, she's keen. She's left
before they revealed the penises.

Oh, there they are.

[wistful music playing]

- [Jamie] I would like you to leave.
- [man] Fine!

297
00:17:17,291 --> 00:17:19,166
You'd better be there. Do you hear me?

298
00:17:33,125 --> 00:17:36,250
- Sorry. Um... I can come back.
- [Jamie] No.

00:17:37,416 --> 00:17:38,916
No, come in. Take a seat.

[clears throat]

301
00:17:54,166 --> 00:17:56,750
What did you think of your piece?

302
00:17:58,625 --> 00:17:59,500
I...

303
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,250
I think I made some good insights,
observations, and analyses.

304
00:18:06,666 --> 00:18:08,458
What did you think of my work?

305
00:18:09,416 --> 00:18:11,750
Work? That's exactly what it felt like.

306
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:18,583
In 3,000 words, you managed to explore
the suffragettes, the birth of feminism,

307
00:18:19,166 --> 00:18:20,249
Salem witch hunts.

308
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:24,125
It's an extraordinary accomplishment.
You did everything except the assignment.

309
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:28,916
Okay, well, um...

310
00:18:29,458 --> 00:18:31,333
I will go work on it some more.

311

- [door opens]
- Wait, no, no. Um...

I'm so sorry.

Um... Let's start again, please.
I'm so sorry.

315
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:45,958
Weird morning.

316
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:55,791
Out of all the poems in the book,
why did you... choose this one?

317
00:18:56,541 --> 00:18:58,458
Because I think
it speaks to a truth about men.

318
00:18:59,041 --> 00:19:02,583
You think that men are only capable
of loving a woman for six months?

319
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:05,124
Some men, yes.

320
00:19:05,125 --> 00:19:07,958
But what if they love deeply

321
00:19:08,708 --> 00:19:09,582
for that time?

322
00:19:09,583 --> 00:19:14,375
Do you think that things
are only meaningful if they last forever?

323
00:19:14,958 --> 00:19:15,791
Of course.

324
00:19:17,083 --> 00:19:18,000
[inhales]

325
00:19:18,583 --> 00:19:20,332
Well, I think that you picked this poem

326
00:19:20,333 --> 00:19:23,374
because you think
that it speaks to something about me,

327
00:19:23,375 --> 00:19:24,665
which is disappointing,

328
00:19:24,666 --> 00:19:27,500
because I wanted to know
something about you.

329
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:33,041
I want you to pick a different poem.
The first one... that speaks to you.

330
00:19:54,666 --> 00:19:56,041
- You have one?
- Mmm.

331
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:57,625
Great.

332
00:20:07,666 --> 00:20:11,541
<i>"Ah, love, let us be true to one another</i>

333
00:20:12,541 --> 00:20:16,500
<i>For the world which seems to lie before us
Like a land of dreams</i>

334
00:20:17,458 --> 00:20:20,166
<i>So various, so beautiful, so new"</i>

335
00:20:20,708 --> 00:20:23,333
<i>"Hath really neither joy
Nor love, nor light"</i>

336
00:20:24,916 --> 00:20:27,833
<i>"Nor certitude, nor peace</i>

337
00:20:28,708 --> 00:20:30,125
<i>Nor help for pain</i>

338
00:20:30,708 --> 00:20:32,915
<i>And we are here as on a darkling plain"</i>

339
00:20:32,916 --> 00:20:37,124
<i>"Swept with confused alarms
Of struggle and flight"</i>

340
00:20:37,125 --> 00:20:39,708
<i>"Where ignorant armies clash by night"</i>

341
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:44,500
Now, quick, without thinking,
what is Matthew Arnold saying?

342
00:20:46,458 --> 00:20:50,208
I think that the reality of life
is that it's hard.

343
00:20:52,166 --> 00:20:53,625
But at least we have each other.

344
00:20:55,833 --> 00:20:56,665
I'm impressed.

345
00:20:56,666 --> 00:21:00,790
You found hope
in the single most pessimistic poem

346
00:21:00,791 --> 00:21:02,166
of the Victorian era.

347
00:21:03,208 --> 00:21:05,000
Well. now you know something about me.

348
00:21:07,125 --> 00:21:09,415
- I just got a call from your Dad--
- Oh my God!

349
00:21:09,416 --> 00:21:11,749
- [Anna] No, it was totally my fault.
- [Jamie] I'm so sorry.

350
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:12,874
- [Anna] Uh...
- [Jamie] Um...

351
00:21:12,875 --> 00:21:14,040
- Hi, Cecelia.
- [Anna] Hi.

352
00:21:14,041 --> 00:21:15,874
- [Jamie] We're just... finishing.
- Uh... Yep.

353
00:21:15,875 --> 00:21:18,708
- [Jamie] Thank you. Thank <i>you</i>. Um...
- [Anna] Yes. Thank you. Yes.

354
00:21:19,375 --> 00:21:21,875
- [Jamie] I'll see you in class. Sorry.
- [Anna] Yeah.

355
00:21:25,541 --> 00:21:26,832
[door opens]

356
00:21:26,833 --> 00:21:27,791
Anna.

357
00:21:28,791 --> 00:21:31,582
It has been brought to our attention
that you've never been to a pub.

358
00:21:31,583 --> 00:21:32,540
True.

359
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:35,083
Disgraceful. Put some shoes on
and follow us immediately.

360
00:21:36,458 --> 00:21:37,749
Ooh, no, not those ones.

361
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:39,791
["Helicopter" by Bloc Party playing]

362
00:21:40,458 --> 00:21:41,707
[Maggie] Pubs are like churches.

363
00:21:41,708 --> 00:21:44,666
Except we consider them sacred
and attend them religiously.

364
00:21:48,208 --> 00:21:49,957
[Tom] To our new friend Anna,

365
00:21:49,958 --> 00:21:55,040
who's come 3,408 miles
for a 929-year-old education.

366
00:21:55,041 --> 00:21:55,958
Cheers.

367
00:21:56,458 --> 00:21:58,500
- Cheers! Yeah!
- Down the hatch! Whoo!

368
00:22:00,541 --> 00:22:03,499
[Tom] Oh God, this thing is
bloody itchy. Hold.

369
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:05,583
Yeah, all right. You haven't...

370
00:22:06,333 --> 00:22:08,624
Just can't...
you just can't get the purchase.

371
00:22:08,625 --> 00:22:10,665
[Charlie] This is your first time
wearing a jumper?

372
00:22:10,666 --> 00:22:12,207
Do we need to talk about Tom?

373
00:22:12,208 --> 00:22:14,290
- [Charlie] You're so nearly there.
- Do you fancy him?

374
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:15,416
No, but you do.

375
00:22:16,916 --> 00:22:18,957
Oh, I know.
I think he's the dog's bollocks.

376
00:22:18,958 --> 00:22:20,749
You think he's the dog's balls?

377
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:22,458
Oh! Oh, no, no, it's a good thing.

378
00:22:23,208 --> 00:22:24,166
[Cecelia] Hmm.

379
00:22:25,125 --> 00:22:26,166
Hello, all.

380
00:22:27,416 --> 00:22:30,666
Everyone's super excited to have you
in Oxford. You're such a novelty.

381
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:33,624
Let me introduce you
to some eligible bachelors.

382
00:22:33,625 --> 00:22:34,833
I'm assuming you're single.

383
00:22:36,041 --> 00:22:36,916
Come, come.

384
00:22:39,541 --> 00:22:41,957
Oxford boys have got brilliant minds.

385
00:22:41,958 --> 00:22:44,915
- You misunderstand me.
- No, I understand you perfectly.

386
00:22:44,916 --> 00:22:47,290
You're saying
that all Americans are stupid.

387
00:22:47,291 --> 00:22:52,624
No, no! You're, um... blunt, naive,

388
00:22:52,625 --> 00:22:55,165
which I happen to find endearing.

389
00:22:55,166 --> 00:22:58,375
And about what exactly
are we so painfully naive?

390
00:22:58,958 --> 00:23:00,040
[man] Little things.

391
00:23:00,041 --> 00:23:02,541
Geography, world history,

392
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:04,582
your gun culture,

393
00:23:04,583 --> 00:23:09,207
your impact on other countries,
your willful celebration of ignorance.

394
00:23:09,208 --> 00:23:10,915
Yeah, you're pissed, Ian. Go home.

395
00:23:10,916 --> 00:23:15,665
And your absolute inability
to understand irony and sarcasm.

396
00:23:15,666 --> 00:23:17,208
Oh yeah. No, that's fair.

397
00:23:18,375 --> 00:23:20,625
Perhaps you could teach me about irony.

398
00:23:21,125 --> 00:23:22,832
I'm sure you're a great teacher.

399
00:23:22,833 --> 00:23:24,000
I actually am.

400
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:26,832
I probably could help you.

401
00:23:26,833 --> 00:23:28,125
- [chuckles]
- [friend laughs]

402
00:23:29,166 --> 00:23:31,582
Hey, Mags, I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

403
00:23:31,583 --> 00:23:32,541
[Maggie] The loo.

404
00:23:33,208 --> 00:23:36,208
- The loo.
- Mugged you off there, mate. [laughs]

405
00:23:40,125 --> 00:23:41,291
[Ian] Hey, Miss Mexico.

406
00:23:43,291 --> 00:23:44,791
Miss Diversity Quota.

407
00:23:49,166 --> 00:23:50,958
Do you have something to say to me?

408
00:23:51,833 --> 00:23:53,915
We all know
you're here to make up the numbers.

409
00:23:53,916 --> 00:23:57,791
And I will forgive you for taking
the place of someone far more deserving

410
00:23:58,291 --> 00:23:59,750
if you buy me a drink.

411
00:24:00,541 --> 00:24:01,458
Hmm.

412
00:24:05,125 --> 00:24:06,625
How about you share mine?

413
00:24:07,375 --> 00:24:08,416
[Ian gasp] Oh my...

414
00:24:09,708 --> 00:24:11,707
[Anna] Hey, Mags, um, I'm gonna go.

415
00:24:11,708 --> 00:24:14,375
- [Maggie] Don't go... Oh!
- This is not my kind of place.

416
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,125
Mate. Don't.

417
00:24:28,208 --> 00:24:29,916
I don't need rescuing, thank you.

418
00:24:30,416 --> 00:24:34,583
No, of course, you're incredibly scary,
but to be clear, I was rescuing him.

419
00:24:35,791 --> 00:24:36,791
Can I walk you home?

420
00:24:37,541 --> 00:24:39,915
I'm pretty sure I can cope
with the mean streets of Oxford.

421
00:24:39,916 --> 00:24:41,291
Oh, you'd be surprised.

422
00:24:41,791 --> 00:24:44,500
It's the gargoyles, actually.
They're especially vicious at night.

423
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,915
They eat Americans. [sighs]

424
00:24:46,916 --> 00:24:49,707
Well, what if I scare them away
by asking blunt questions?

425
00:24:49,708 --> 00:24:53,583
Oh yeah, that would work. Big time.
That's kryptonite for the British.

426
00:24:54,083 --> 00:24:55,333
Even the gargoyles.

427
00:24:58,375 --> 00:25:01,665
I wouldn't wanna drag you away
from your harem of girls back there.

428
00:25:01,666 --> 00:25:05,208
Well, if harem girls are anything,
it's patient.

429
00:25:07,916 --> 00:25:09,125
[chuckles]

430
00:25:10,791 --> 00:25:11,666
Shall we?

431
00:25:15,708 --> 00:25:18,625
At least my first time in a British pub
will be memorable.

432
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:21,958
That was your first time in a British pub?

433
00:25:24,291 --> 00:25:25,458
Unacceptable.

434
00:25:27,416 --> 00:25:30,207
So, Anna, why did you choose Oxford?

435
00:25:30,208 --> 00:25:32,375
I have a library fetish.

436
00:25:34,833 --> 00:25:35,749
Okay.

437
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:38,582
I just love being surrounded by books.

438
00:25:38,583 --> 00:25:41,708
I just think there's no better smell
in the world than the smell of old books.

439
00:25:43,083 --> 00:25:46,291
When I was ten,
I read all the Philip Pullman novels, and

440
00:25:47,083 --> 00:25:48,665
the story of a young girl

441
00:25:48,666 --> 00:25:53,082
rushing across this magical
and ancient city stuck with me,

442
00:25:53,083 --> 00:25:56,082
and I decided that somehow, some way,

443
00:25:56,083 --> 00:26:00,541
I would sit among those dusty old books
and first editions.

444
00:26:01,333 --> 00:26:03,665
Sorry, you started planning
to come here when you were ten?

445
00:26:03,666 --> 00:26:05,874
Ten and three quarters, actually.

446
00:26:05,875 --> 00:26:07,790
Oh, fine, then. Great.

447
00:26:07,791 --> 00:26:10,165
My parents always told me
that I could do anything,

448
00:26:10,166 --> 00:26:13,583
so it just never even crossed my mind
that I shouldn't try.

449
00:26:15,166 --> 00:26:16,457
They must be really proud of you.

450
00:26:16,458 --> 00:26:17,999
They're even prouder of the fact

451
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,332
that I already have a job
as a financial analyst

452
00:26:20,333 --> 00:26:22,250
at Goldman Sachs when I get back.

453
00:26:22,833 --> 00:26:23,832
Uh, what...

454
00:26:23,833 --> 00:26:26,499
As a layman, what does an analyst do?

455
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:29,874
It's primarily research.
Digging into companies, their accounts,

456
00:26:29,875 --> 00:26:33,458
and compiling that information
into reports for corporate clients.

457
00:26:34,375 --> 00:26:37,082
That sounds riveting.

458
00:26:37,083 --> 00:26:41,458
Well, not everyone can afford
a vintage car on a teacher's salary.

459
00:26:42,125 --> 00:26:43,915
It's funny,
I've got it in the back of my head.

460
00:26:43,916 --> 00:26:46,249
I was wondering what happened
to that ten-year-old dreamer.

461
00:26:46,250 --> 00:26:48,000
She found a new dream.

462
00:26:49,125 --> 00:26:51,583
To make enough money
not to have to worry about money.

463
00:26:52,291 --> 00:26:54,665
Mo... money can't solve all problems.

464
00:26:54,666 --> 00:26:57,166
Is literally something
only rich people say.

465
00:26:58,291 --> 00:27:04,415
There's no safety net for me, you know,
so it's college, Oxford, Goldman, period.

466
00:27:04,416 --> 00:27:07,708
- Got it all planned out.
- I mean, you have to, don't you think?

467
00:27:09,083 --> 00:27:10,833
If you wanna live deliberately.

468
00:27:13,291 --> 00:27:18,375
I think that life has a way
of derailing even the best-laid plans.

469
00:27:19,041 --> 00:27:19,874
Really?

470
00:27:19,875 --> 00:27:21,624
And I'm also of the opinion

471
00:27:21,625 --> 00:27:25,333
that the best bits of life
are often the messiest.

It's just incredible
that Shelley and Tolkien and Wilde

No, if you like this,

817
00:46:41,333 --> 00:46:44,540
then you absolutely have to go
on a grand tour around Europe

before you leave.

819

A grand tour?

820
00:46:46,750 --> 00:46:49,124
Yeah, like Byron.
You've gotta start in Paris.

- Mmm.
- Get drunk by the Seine, of course.

822
00:46:50,833 --> 00:46:51,791
Of course.

823
00:46:52,375 --> 00:46:56,375
And then I'd go to Venice
and spend the whole night on a gondola.

824
00:46:56,875 --> 00:46:59,707
And then I'd go to Greece
and I'd visit the Temple of Poseidon.

825
00:46:59,708 --> 00:47:02,124
It's high on a promontory

[gentle music playing]

And then I'd sit down on a

00:47:07,625 --> 00:47:10,916

829
00:47:11,708 --> 00:47:14,125
watch "sunset and evening star."

Sounds like someone else has a plan.

Yeah, I think I might.

832
00:47:21,041 --> 00:47:22,250
And you must...

833
00:47:22,791 --> 00:47:26,250
you must go
to the red-light district in Amsterdam.

I'm not that kind of girl.

835
00:47:28,125 --> 00:47:29,416
No, there's a

836
00:47:30,166 --> 00:47:31,540
church there.

837
00:47:31,541 --> 00:47:32,958
Our Lord in the Attic.

838
00:47:34,166 --> 00:47:37,500
This hidden door
leads you to this sanctuary.

840

We could go together.

843

- Together?
- Hmm.

844
00:47:57,083 --> 00:47:59,750
I don't know, Professor.
That sounds rather serious.

845

I'm only looking for fun.

846
00:48:04,416 --> 00:48:06,083
I go back to New York soon.

Yes, you do.

848
00:48:12,458 --> 00:48:16,750
Well, maybe instead of a grand tour,
we could do a small tour.

849
00:48:18,458 --> 00:48:19,916
Round my place.

850
00:48:21,041 --> 00:48:22,291
Your place?

851
00:48:23,541 --> 00:48:25,541
- You have a place?
- I do.

Wow.

[chuckles]

855
00:48:37,416 --> 00:48:39,416
[Jamie] Don't judge me.
I'm still gettin' settled in.

856
00:48:39,916 --> 00:48:43,083
I only moved out of college a year ago.

857
00:48:43,958 --> 00:48:46,083
My, uh... aunt left me the house.

858
00:48:46,708 --> 00:48:48,374
I say left. She's not dead.

859
00:48:48,375 --> 00:48:51,999
She, um... just couldn't be bothered
with the renovation

860
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,582
and, of course, moved to Croatia.

861
00:48:54,583 --> 00:48:56,416
Did you build these toy cars?

862
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,833
They're model cars. Um...

863
00:48:59,333 --> 00:49:03,625
But yes, when I was a kid, with my dad.
And my brother, Eddie.

864
00:49:04,541 --> 00:49:06,000
It's a lot harder than it looks.

865
00:49:06,666 --> 00:49:09,333
We'd spend days on each one,
the three of us.

866
00:49:10,375 --> 00:49:12,500
Hours into the night.

867
00:49:13,500 --> 00:49:16,625
And then, when I got older,
we started working on real cars.

868
00:49:17,375 --> 00:49:18,790
Like the Jaguar?

869
00:49:18,791 --> 00:49:19,750
Yeah, that...

870
00:49:24,833 --> 00:49:28,833
That was the last thing that we did
before Eddie died.

- It's funny.

Every person in your family
plays a certain role, right?

873
00:49:34,583 --> 00:49:37,333
And after he was gone,
I realized that I didn't just lose

874
00:49:38,125 --> 00:49:38,957
my brother.

875
00:49:38,958 --> 00:49:43,375
I lost my whole way
of communicating with my father.

876
00:49:45,875 --> 00:49:48,082
- Have you spoken to him about it?
- [laughs] No.

No. We're Englishmen, Anna.

880

I've told anyone
I'm not speaking to my dad.

Yes... uh, but,

1252
01:12:22,333 --> 01:12:26,624
maybe, Maggie, it is not the length
of time that you spend on Earth.

1253
01:12:26,625 --> 01:12:28,291
Maybe it's what you do with it.

1254
01:12:33,208 --> 01:12:35,166
Well, I hope to be in a bar when I die.

1255
01:12:36,041 --> 01:12:39,582
Not in a sad way.
In, like, a... In, like, a fun way.

1256
01:12:39,583 --> 01:12:42,582
No, but I, like... So if I'm, like, laughing
and I fall off my chair.

1257
01:12:42,583 --> 01:12:44,624
But not because I've had too much to...

1258
01:12:44,625 --> 01:12:46,915
I may have had, like, one drink,
maybe two, like?

1259
01:12:46,916 --> 01:12:50,249
But a fun drink, like, with a straw.
Piña colada, something like that.

1260
01:12:50,250 --> 01:12:52,332
And my boyfriend, he's there.
He loves that.

1261
01:12:52,333 --> 01:12:54,165
He kisses me on the cheek,
like, um, tenderly,

1262
01:12:54,166 --> 01:12:56,540
but enough to say
we're still interested in each other.

1263
01:12:56,541 --> 01:12:59,249
At that point,
I'm doing a lot of philanthropy,

1264
01:12:59,250 --> 01:13:01,124
and I think people can tell.

1265
01:13:01,125 --> 01:13:02,999
There's a twinkle in my eyes
that says I care.

1266
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:06,582
So when I die,
there's a big loss to the charity sector.

1267
01:13:06,583 --> 01:13:07,915
People are obviously upset.

1268
01:13:07,916 --> 01:13:10,582
You know, a great beauty lost from Oxford.

1269
01:13:10,583 --> 01:13:13,874
But then, obvi-- But I do still die,
but it's, like, the right time.

1270
01:13:13,875 --> 01:13:15,166
But, yes, it's in a bar.

1271
01:13:16,541 --> 01:13:19,416
So Tennyson's bar is a sandbar.

1272
01:13:20,458 --> 01:13:21,374
Um...

1273
01:13:21,375 --> 01:13:23,332
[gentle music playing]

1274
01:13:23,333 --> 01:13:24,415
[Anna's mother] <i>Anna!</i>

1275
01:13:24,416 --> 01:13:25,915
Mom, what are you doing up?

1276
01:13:25,916 --> 01:13:27,624
<i>I just finished the night shift.</i>

1277
01:13:27,625 --> 01:13:30,207
<i>It's overtime.
You know I cannot say no to that.</i>

1278
01:13:30,208 --> 01:13:31,624
<i>Anyway, because I'm up,</i>

1279
01:13:31,625 --> 01:13:33,332
I get to talk to you.

1280
01:13:33,333 --> 01:13:35,207
<i>You're back so soon!</i>

1281
01:13:35,208 --> 01:13:38,124
[sighs] I know. It's gone so fast.

1282
01:13:38,125 --> 01:13:40,583
<i>Oh, no, it's been too long.</i>

1283
01:13:41,125 --> 01:13:43,165
<i>I saw Stephen Delgado's mother.</i>

1284
01:13:43,166 --> 01:13:44,457
Oh, how is he?

1285
01:13:44,458 --> 01:13:46,250
<i>He's making six figures already.</i>

1286
01:13:50,250 --> 01:13:53,208
Anna, I have something
I really need to discuss with you.

1287
01:13:54,208 --> 01:13:55,041
Yes?

1288
01:13:55,625 --> 01:13:58,249
- Your birthday. It's next weekend.
- Oh my God. Jamie!

1289
01:13:58,250 --> 01:14:02,915
So which should it be?
Are we gonna get drunk by the Seine,

1290
01:14:02,916 --> 01:14:06,458
or are we gonna go swimming
in the Aegean, or both?

1291
01:14:08,333 --> 01:14:11,250
We can do anything.
Go anywhere that your heart desires.

1292
01:14:12,083 --> 01:14:13,458
- Go anywhere?
- Anywhere.

1293
01:14:14,583 --> 01:14:16,208
- And do anything?
- Anything.

1294
01:14:16,708 --> 01:14:18,166
[joyful music playing]

1295
01:14:18,916 --> 01:14:21,625
- Whoo-hoo!
- Jesus Christ, look at the road!

1296
01:14:24,250 --> 01:14:28,833
Je... You can wipe that smug smile
right off your face.

1297
01:14:29,708 --> 01:14:30,582
Slow down.

1298
01:14:30,583 --> 01:14:33,500
- Slow down, we're turning! Oh my God!
- [Anna squeals]

1299
01:14:36,125 --> 01:14:39,082
Anna, I have restored this car once.
Please, please, please be careful.

1300
01:14:39,083 --> 01:14:40,790
[Anna] Oh, come on, this is so much fun!

1301
01:14:40,791 --> 01:14:42,207
[Jamie] Please focus on the road.

1302
01:14:42,208 --> 01:14:45,082
I feel like I'm Elizabeth Bennett
on the road to Pemberley.

1303
01:14:45,083 --> 01:14:47,540
It takes her, like, an hour
just to get past the grounds.

1304
01:14:47,541 --> 01:14:49,625
Then all of a sudden
they turn a corner and...

1305
01:14:50,333 --> 01:14:52,000
Oh my God!

1306
01:14:56,625 --> 01:14:57,708
You grew up here?

1307
01:14:58,750 --> 01:14:59,625
Yes.

1308
01:15:00,250 --> 01:15:02,499
- Here?
- Yes.

1309
01:15:02,500 --> 01:15:04,916
- This place?
- [chuckles] Yes.

1310
01:15:05,750 --> 01:15:06,666
Huh.

1311
01:15:08,458 --> 01:15:09,332
What a shithole.

1312
01:15:09,333 --> 01:15:10,708
[laughs]

1313
01:15:11,375 --> 01:15:13,166
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

1314
01:15:19,250 --> 01:15:20,833
[Anna] Whoo-hoo!

1315
01:15:28,125 --> 01:15:29,791
- Oh, you're here!
- [Jamie] Hello.

1316
01:15:30,666 --> 01:15:32,957
Oh, Anna, you get more beautiful
each time I see you.

1317
01:15:32,958 --> 01:15:35,165
- Oh!
- Keep this up and we shan't be friends.

1318
01:15:35,166 --> 01:15:36,874
[chuckles] How are you?

1319
01:15:36,875 --> 01:15:38,790
- [sighs]
- She's in Anglophile ecstasy.

1320
01:15:38,791 --> 01:15:40,666
[laughs] Hello, darling.

1321
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:44,083
Your father's just finishing some reading.

1322
01:15:45,750 --> 01:15:48,290
Come, let me show you
where Elizabeth imprisoned Mary.

1323
01:15:48,291 --> 01:15:49,499
- [Anna] No...
- [Jamie] Yes.

1324
01:15:49,500 --> 01:15:50,582
- [Anna] No!
- [Jamie] Yes.

1325
01:15:50,583 --> 01:15:51,833
[dog barking]

1326
01:15:58,375 --> 01:16:00,165
Well, if he ever gets
too big for his boots,

1327
01:16:00,166 --> 01:16:02,707
remind him that
his grandfather seven times removed

1328
01:16:02,708 --> 01:16:04,582
was groom of the stool,

1329
01:16:04,583 --> 01:16:06,916
meaning he wiped the king's arse.

1330
01:16:07,583 --> 01:16:11,624
Hi. I was just learning about
your grandfather seven times removed.

1331
01:16:11,625 --> 01:16:14,332
Okay, right, so she tells this story
like it's a really bad thing,

1332
01:16:14,333 --> 01:16:15,999
but Lord Norris was very powerful.

1333
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:17,207
He had the ear of the king.

1334
01:16:17,208 --> 01:16:18,540
And not just the ear.

1335
01:16:18,541 --> 01:16:19,499
[laughs]

1336
01:16:19,500 --> 01:16:22,458
Come, let me show you the tapestry room.
Lead on, my dear.

1337
01:16:26,083 --> 01:16:28,541
Surprise!

1338
01:16:29,291 --> 01:16:31,041
- No, you didn't.
- I'm afraid I did.

1339
01:16:32,625 --> 01:16:34,250
Surprise!

1340
01:16:34,875 --> 01:16:36,540
Jamie, I don't like surprises.

1341
01:16:36,541 --> 01:16:40,541
Oh, my mistake. I'll just cancel
the birthday and send ev--

1342
01:16:46,208 --> 01:16:48,208
Should we... um...

1343
01:16:49,666 --> 01:16:51,666
- Right. [giggles]
- Yes. Yes!

1344
01:16:52,625 --> 01:16:54,540
Surprise?

1345
01:16:54,541 --> 01:16:57,332
- Yes!
- Yay!

1346
01:16:57,333 --> 01:16:58,582
- Hi!
- [Maggie] Hi!

1347
01:16:58,583 --> 01:16:59,957
To Anna!

1348
01:16:59,958 --> 01:17:01,458
[all] To Anna!

1349
01:17:02,750 --> 01:17:04,332
- [all] Yay!
- [Jamie] Ooh!

1350
01:17:04,333 --> 01:17:06,374
Charlie, you're actually
quite good at this.

1351
01:17:06,375 --> 01:17:08,833
I was the captain
of my school croquet team.

1352
01:17:09,500 --> 01:17:11,124
We lost every game.

1353
01:17:11,125 --> 01:17:14,374
Right, who's next?
Is it the birthday girl, you say?

1354
01:17:14,375 --> 01:17:15,916
[all] Yes!

1355
01:17:16,416 --> 01:17:17,624
You know, I've never played.

1356
01:17:17,625 --> 01:17:19,624
Oh, really?
It's a good job that you've got a list

1357
01:17:19,625 --> 01:17:21,457
of things you've never done
that you're doing.

1358
01:17:21,458 --> 01:17:23,083
Actually, I don't have the list anymore.

1359
01:17:23,916 --> 01:17:25,040
Completed it?

1360
01:17:25,041 --> 01:17:27,750
No, just... taking each day as it comes.

1361
01:17:29,125 --> 01:17:30,624
- [Jamie] I like it.
- [Anna] Mmm.

1362
01:17:30,625 --> 01:17:32,457
[Jamie] Right, okay, so...

1363
01:17:32,458 --> 01:17:33,749
- Just bend over?
- [Jamie] Yeah.

1364
01:17:33,750 --> 01:17:35,749
- [Tom whistles]
- Oh my God, get a room.

1365
01:17:35,750 --> 01:17:38,458
We have a room.
Queen Elizabeth slept in it.

1366
01:17:38,583 --> 01:17:40,875
- Oooh!
- [all gasp and laugh]

1367
01:17:42,083 --> 01:17:43,207
- [all] Aww.
- [Jamie] Ah, okay.

1368
01:17:43,208 --> 01:17:44,832
So actually, in croquet

1369
01:17:44,833 --> 01:17:45,832
that's terrible.

1370
01:17:45,833 --> 01:17:47,874
- [all chuckle]
- I think I just have a bad teacher.

1371
01:17:47,875 --> 01:17:49,707
Really? Wow, okay. Seems a bit harsh.

1372
01:17:49,708 --> 01:17:50,958
- [all laugh]
- Uh, next?

1373
01:17:51,958 --> 01:17:53,166
[all cheer]

1374
01:17:56,750 --> 01:17:57,790
[Anna laughing]

1375
01:17:57,791 --> 01:17:59,583
Oh, actually, is one bottle enough?

1376
01:18:00,416 --> 01:18:01,999
- Charlie.
- Mm-hmm.

1377
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:03,290
- Mmm.
- I'll get another one.

1378
01:18:03,291 --> 01:18:05,125
- Okay.
- Back in a sec.

1379
01:18:10,875 --> 01:18:12,958
- Oh, sorry. No, please. You...
- Sorry. After you.

1380
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,958
- I'll just take this up.
- We're having beef Wellington.

1381
01:18:17,750 --> 01:18:19,291
Yeah. This is for outside.

1382
01:18:20,458 --> 01:18:23,000
Jamie, might we have a word?

1383
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:24,875
Must we?

1384
01:18:25,625 --> 01:18:26,500
Today?

1385
01:18:28,791 --> 01:18:29,666
Fine.

1386
01:18:34,291 --> 01:18:35,500
[sighs]

1387
01:18:38,250 --> 01:18:39,208
[sighs]

1388
01:18:48,500 --> 01:18:49,583
Ah...

1389
01:18:54,916 --> 01:18:57,165
- I'll get the broom.
- Leave it. Luke can clean it up.

1390
01:18:57,166 --> 01:18:59,250
- It's not necessary.
- I said leave it!

1391
01:19:02,833 --> 01:19:04,166
Will you listen to me?

1392
01:19:05,291 --> 01:19:06,291
Just for once.

1393
01:19:08,708 --> 01:19:12,374
Now, I spoke with Dr. Patel,
and he said there's a new drug--

1394
01:19:12,375 --> 01:19:15,040
No more drugs. I told you, I'm done.

1395
01:19:15,041 --> 01:19:18,458
- You have to keep fighting!
- God, you just don't get it!

1396
01:19:19,083 --> 01:19:22,790
[sighs] I don't wanna spend
the time that I have left in a hospital.

1397
01:19:22,791 --> 01:19:26,999
I wanna spend it in Oxford, doing
what I love with the people that I love.

1398
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:28,375
I won't accept it.

1399
01:19:29,250 --> 01:19:31,250
I can't just watch you...

1400
01:19:32,666 --> 01:19:34,375
Your brother at least tried.

1401
01:19:35,750 --> 01:19:36,666
Yes.

1402
01:19:37,208 --> 01:19:38,083
[sighs] Yeah.

1403
01:19:38,708 --> 01:19:40,458
Edward never put a foot wrong
in your eyes.

1404

[Charlie] Um...

1565
01:28:25,875 --> 01:28:27,416
So... Sorry. What's funny?

1566
01:28:28,166 --> 01:28:30,082
[Jamie] Charlie,
I'm so sorry to disappoint you,

1567
01:28:30,083 --> 01:28:34,040
but if there is one thing
that is absolutely certain,

1568
01:28:34,041 --> 01:28:37,458
it's that I will be leaving Anna.

1569
01:28:43,291 --> 01:28:46,707
I have one more year of med school,
and I am gonna keep studying for you.

1570
01:28:46,708 --> 01:28:49,707
Curing incurable diseases
cannot be that hard.

1571
01:28:49,708 --> 01:28:53,165
It might be a bit late for me, Tom,
but I really appreciate the thought.

1572
01:28:53,166 --> 01:28:55,290
Hey, where are
we taking this party to next?

1573
01:28:55,291 --> 01:28:56,749
We are taking you to bed.

1574
01:28:56,750 --> 01:28:59,457
You only want one thing,
and from now on, I won't put out.

1575
01:28:59,458 --> 01:29:01,082
- 'Cause I deserve more!
- Thank you.

01:29:01,083 --> 01:29:02,583
- Come on.
- [Jamie] Amazing.

1577
01:29:04,083 --> 01:29:06,000
- Sleep well, Ceci.
- Night, night, darling.

1578
01:29:06,500 --> 01:29:08,166
- See you in the morning.
- See you. Night.

Um...

1580
01:29:10,333 --> 01:29:13,208
Dad and I might
take another crack at the car,

1581
01:29:13,916 --> 01:29:15,166
if that's okay?

1582
01:29:15,833 --> 01:29:16,916
No.

1583

- [Jamie] Right. You.

1589
01:29:46,833 --> 01:29:48,874
- [William] The car!
- And no more messing around.

1590
01:29:48,875 --> 01:29:51,000
- No more messing around.
- Because you were the reason...

I don't want the same things

I'm staying here.

What? No! No, no!

- You did?
- Yes, of course!

And I didn't just mean
you are capable of anything.

Have you spoken to Cecelia?
There's no future here.

Well, there's no future guaranteed
anywhere, but here, there's you.

You can't stay, Anna. I won't let you.

- You're being ridiculous.
- Stop telling me what I am!

that I'm yours to mold to your ideals,

but I'm not, Jamie.

Yes, I know that you're not,

1657
01:33:16,750 --> 01:33:20,375
because I would never let you make
such a bloody stupid decision.

1658
01:33:24,750 --> 01:33:25,875
What are you doing?

1659
01:33:26,916 --> 01:33:28,541
Now where... where are you going? Where...

1660
01:33:30,333 --> 01:33:31,957
There's a million rooms in this house.

I'm sure I can find
another place to sleep.

You still haven't spoken to him?

I mean, this is insane. You can't just
go back to New York after everything.

he didn't want me to stay.

Hi.

1702
01:37:03,083 --> 01:37:04,791
- Hello, Laura.
- Sorry.

1703
01:37:05,458 --> 01:37:08,124
A student asked me
to set this book for them. Is that okay?

1704
01:37:08,125 --> 01:37:09,041
Yes, of course.

1705
01:37:36,583 --> 01:37:38,333
It reads differently now.

1706
01:37:41,625 --> 01:37:43,083
I realized that

1707
01:37:44,458 --> 01:37:45,666
I had it all wrong.

1708
01:37:47,666 --> 01:37:51,458
As you so politely tried to tell me
that first night we went out,

1709
01:37:52,666 --> 01:37:56,583
that what Thoreau meant
by living deliberately

1710
01:37:57,583 --> 01:37:59,791
wasn't planning everything, but...

1711
01:38:00,708 --> 01:38:04,250
but being definite
about every small moment.

1712
01:38:06,375 --> 01:38:09,291
Because a succession of moments
is really all we have.

1713
01:38:11,958 --> 01:38:14,041
And I want mine to be with you.

1714
01:38:16,500 --> 01:38:18,041
However many we have left.

1715
01:38:22,583 --> 01:38:25,707
You know Thoreau was basically having
a mental breakdown when he wrote that?

1716
01:38:25,708 --> 01:38:27,208
I have learned that, yes.

1717
01:38:34,500 --> 01:38:36,416
Anna, I want this more than anything.

1718
01:38:37,125 --> 01:38:38,416
But this is madness.

1719
01:38:41,333 --> 01:38:42,250

00:02:03,083 --> 00:02:05,458
一切都按計畫進行

29
00:02:05,958 --> 00:02:07,750
直到後來變了調

30
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:21,583
來吧

31
00:02:32,166 --> 00:02:35,083
你的美貌跟我的興趣一樣都會消逝

32
00:02:35,666 --> 00:02:36,500
你好

33
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:40,041
-我叫安娜德拉維加
-是誰在講話？

34
00:02:40,125 --> 00:02:41,125
一個美國人

35
00:02:41,208 --> 00:02:43,333
長得很漂亮，鞋卻醜到爆

36
00:03:50,833 --> 00:03:53,458
（克拉倫登樓）

37
00:04:00,166 --> 00:04:01,000
混蛋！

38
00:04:10,666 --> 00:04:11,666
下雨了？

39
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:13,083
其實沒有

40
00:04:14,416 --> 00:04:15,250
你好

41
00:04:16,333 --> 00:04:18,375
請給我炸魚薯條

42
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:19,375
黑線鱈？

43
00:04:19,458 --> 00:04:20,291
黑線「血」？

44
00:04:20,791 --> 00:04:22,125
不是，我要魚肉

45
00:04:22,208 --> 00:04:25,208
對，黑線鱈、鱈魚或乾臘腸

46
00:04:25,291 --> 00:04:26,666
我不是…我…

47
00:04:27,666 --> 00:04:28,916
衹要…炸魚薯條？

48
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
-大的？
-大的，對

49
00:04:31,083 --> 00:04:33,125
-八鎊半，五分鐘
-好極了

50
00:04:34,416 --> 00:04:36,583
（鱈德利炸魚薯條店）

51
00:04:39,916 --> 00:04:42,416
傑米，這不是牛津最高級的餐廳

52
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,708
也算前三名了，你好，老兄

53
00:04:44,791 --> 00:04:50,250
我要兩份大的鱈魚
豌荳泥、醃洋蔥和薯條

54
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:51,875
薯條？

55
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,750
你該吃嗎？

56
00:04:53,833 --> 00:04:57,208
天啊，你說得對
不忌口，就發胖，對吧？

57
00:04:58,166 --> 00:05:00,583
麻煩換成兩份特大薯條

58
00:05:00,666 --> 00:05:04,750
別理這位女士
她還沒學會怎麼從容不迫地生活

59
00:05:04,833 --> 00:05:06,083
（《湖濱散記》）

60
00:05:06,166 --> 00:05:08,291
又不是我禁止你吃…

61
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:10,250
你在幹嘛？

62
00:05:11,625 --> 00:05:12,833
天啊，你在躱藏？

63
00:05:12,916 --> 00:05:16,208
不是，我在對抗不聽話的鞋帶

64
00:05:16,291 --> 00:05:18,291
你在躱潔西卡波恩

65
00:05:18,791 --> 00:05:22,958
拋棄過那麼多女人
你還能走出家門眞是奇蹟啊

66
00:05:25,791 --> 00:05:28,625
反正她已經走了
她八成認出了你的車

67
00:05:28,708 --> 00:05:32,083
可能吧，誰叫我開的是稀有車款
實在太明顯了

68
00:05:32,166 --> 00:05:35,458
龐德就是這點沒想清楚
他早該開普通車款的

69
00:05:37,375 --> 00:05:38,541
天啊

70
00:05:39,416 --> 00:05:40,583
是你！

71
00:05:41,125 --> 00:05:41,958
我？

72
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:45,333
對，你就是那個混蛋
開車經過把我的衣服都濺濕了

73
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:52,416
我…該死

74
00:05:54,083 --> 00:05:55,750
炸魚薯條好了，親愛的

75
00:06:00,166 --> 00:06:01,875
眞的很抱歉

76
00:06:02,625 --> 00:06:03,583
眞的

77
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:05,583
對，我也是

78
00:06:06,875 --> 00:06:08,125
-嘿
-嫑

79
00:06:08,208 --> 00:06:09,125
他在裡面

80
00:06:09,666 --> 00:06:10,958
躱你

81
00:06:11,875 --> 00:06:12,916
嫑

82
00:06:26,875 --> 00:06:29,125
-親愛的潔西卡，你好
-你好嗎，潔西卡？

83
00:06:29,625 --> 00:06:32,458
（八點，鬧鐘）

84
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
歡迎

85
00:06:39,708 --> 00:06:41,500
來到牛津大學

86
00:06:41,583 --> 00:06:44,458
本校數百年來屹立不搖

87
00:06:45,125 --> 00:06:47,541
而在那些歲月裡，每一年

88
00:06:47,625 --> 00:06:50,458
都會迎來一群新的年輕人

89
00:06:51,625 --> 00:06:56,208
偉大的領袖、科學家與文學夢想家

90
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:59,666
都是在你們之前通過這些門扉的前輩

91
00:07:00,416 --> 00:07:03,083
你們會遺忘自己在這裡參加過的派對

92
00:07:03,583 --> 00:07:05,708
也會遺忘在這裡交到的朋友

93
00:07:05,791 --> 00:07:10,875
但你們永遠不會忘記在此學習的知識

94
00:07:12,125 --> 00:07:13,916
在這裡的時光非常寶貴

95
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,541
一眨眼就會消失

96
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:18,583
請好好把握

97
00:07:48,458 --> 00:07:50,083
別緊張，你沒遲到

98
00:07:50,666 --> 00:07:52,041
對，我衹是…我…

99
00:07:52,125 --> 00:07:54,708
我剛才在那個…

100
00:07:54,791 --> 00:07:57,791
-我是瑪姬提姆斯
-你好，我是安娜德拉維加

101
00:07:59,291 --> 00:08:01,833
-你是美國人嗎？
-對，來自紐約皇后區

102
00:08:01,916 --> 00:08:03,875
早安，我來了

103
00:08:03,958 --> 00:08:06,000
查理，暑假過得如何？

104
00:08:06,625 --> 00:08:07,708
缺乏愛情的滋潤

105
00:08:07,791 --> 00:08:11,041
我本來在跟蹤那個划船選手
他眼神魅惑，胸肌硬如…

106
00:08:11,125 --> 00:08:12,041
這是安娜

107
00:08:13,375 --> 00:08:15,083
-你好，新同學
-我們其實見過了

108
00:08:16,416 --> 00:08:18,583
你的鄰居？你說我的鞋醜到爆

109
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:22,250
沒想到你這麼有魅力
整個夏天卻還是缺乏愛情的滋潤

110
00:08:22,333 --> 00:08:24,958
是缺乏愛情，親愛的，不是缺乏性愛

111
00:08:25,041 --> 00:08:27,833
而你美妙的笑容
就足以彌補醜到爆的鞋了

112
00:08:27,916 --> 00:08:29,958
大家好

113
00:08:30,041 --> 00:08:33,000
天啊，是史黛安敎授，我很崇拜她

114
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,708
我就是為了她才來這裡的

115
00:08:35,791 --> 00:08:37,333
我恐怕有壞消息

116
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:39,291
我被任命為研究所所長

117
00:08:39,375 --> 00:08:43,000
這代表我不能降級來敎你們
至少這學期不行

118
00:08:43,625 --> 00:08:47,875
我的代課老師很有能力
其實他是我討人厭的天才博士生

119
00:08:47,958 --> 00:08:51,458
我負責打分數
他負責敎學，可以說是兩全其美

120
00:08:52,125 --> 00:08:54,125
我可不是在剝削年輕人

121
00:08:54,208 --> 00:08:56,583
他眞的想敎書，那是他的問題

122
00:08:57,291 --> 00:09:01,375
那我們有緣再見，各位

123
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:03,125
交給你了，傑米

124
00:09:03,208 --> 00:09:04,166
謝謝

125
00:09:05,375 --> 00:09:06,208
各位好

126
00:09:06,833 --> 00:09:09,166
天啊，不會吧

127
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:11,041
他眞的很誘人

128
00:09:11,125 --> 00:09:14,000
因為這是我第一堂課

129
00:09:14,083 --> 00:09:16,416
我想先定調，並且先來

130
00:09:16,916 --> 00:09:17,833
収買各位

131
00:09:21,416 --> 00:09:22,750
這是個

132
00:09:23,791 --> 00:09:24,875
大蛋糕

133
00:09:28,125 --> 00:09:28,958
那麼…

134
00:09:29,916 --> 00:09:30,958
自己動手吧

135
00:09:31,541 --> 00:09:33,250
不需要那個蛋糕，我願意吃掉他

136
00:09:34,125 --> 00:09:35,000
對

137
00:09:35,666 --> 00:09:40,166
五年前，我就坐在各位現在的位置

138
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:42,916
史黛安敎授走進來，我心想

139
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,125
「原來接下來幾個月
會讓我無聊至極的女人就是她」

140
00:09:50,083 --> 00:09:51,000
你好

141
00:09:51,083 --> 00:09:52,250
是你

142
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:54,208
你好

143
00:09:54,791 --> 00:09:55,625
你好

144
00:09:57,208 --> 00:10:03,375
各位先生女士，有個同學大老遠從…

145
00:10:04,541 --> 00:10:07,875
-紐約
-從紐約前來，熱烈歡迎你

146
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:12,416
我註意到你沒拿蛋糕
我們可不能忘了待客之道

147
00:10:13,833 --> 00:10:15,958
而且俗話的確說

148
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:17,958
紐約什麼東西都比較大

149
00:10:18,625 --> 00:10:20,500
其實是德州

150
00:10:21,125 --> 00:10:22,000
一樣啦

151
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:28,083
-我不想吃蛋糕，謝謝
-不想吃蛋糕？

152
00:10:28,166 --> 00:10:30,041
-對
-好吧，對

153
00:10:30,125 --> 00:10:33,541
衹是這是麥肯奇太太
在本大學廚房裡精心製作的

154
00:10:33,625 --> 00:10:37,125
所以等於是侮辱本校
這裡每個人跟整個牛津的…

155
00:10:37,208 --> 00:10:39,750
-我吃就是了
-我不會強迫你吃，我衹是…

156
00:10:39,833 --> 00:10:41,291
-很少有…
-但我想吃

157
00:10:41,375 --> 00:10:42,958
-我知道你想吃，但…
-我堅持

158
00:10:59,083 --> 00:11:00,250
眞美味

159
00:11:02,458 --> 00:11:04,250
很好，詩

160
00:11:04,333 --> 00:11:08,041
我喜歡詩，但老一輩的人
才會喜歡維多利亞時代的詩

161
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:11,125
戴高帽的老人
不斷談論在國外征戰的榮耀

162
00:11:11,208 --> 00:11:14,750
這可能有點無趣，不過…

163
00:11:15,666 --> 00:11:17,875
但我完全沒想到

164
00:11:17,958 --> 00:11:21,000
會在維多利亞時代的作品中看到

165
00:11:21,541 --> 00:11:24,166
這麼深的…絕望

166
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:26,833
恐懼、美麗

167
00:11:26,916 --> 00:11:28,541
智慧、慾望

168
00:11:29,208 --> 00:11:31,333
如果你不介意的話

169
00:11:31,416 --> 00:11:33,833
麻煩為我們唸這首詩

170
00:11:33,916 --> 00:11:36,208
作者是美國人

171
00:11:36,291 --> 00:11:40,875
所以我們都想聽聽原本的韻律

172
00:11:46,791 --> 00:11:49,000
「我的蠟燭兩頭燒」

173
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:51,375
「撐不過一夜」

174
00:11:52,083 --> 00:11:55,125
「但是啊，我的敵人
還有，噢，我的朋友」

175
00:11:55,958 --> 00:11:57,458
「燭光卻是如此美麗」

176
00:12:00,458 --> 00:12:01,333
謝謝

177
00:12:02,458 --> 00:12:04,666
那是埃德娜聖文森特米萊的作品

178
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:08,666
有很多不同的詮釋，但我的看法如下

179
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:12,791
我認為她想表達
美好人生可能要付出代價

180
00:12:12,875 --> 00:12:15,625
但我的天啊，眞的很値得

181
00:12:16,416 --> 00:12:17,958
永恆並不存在

182
00:12:18,041 --> 00:12:21,083
我們的熱情、愛或生活

183
00:12:21,166 --> 00:12:23,666
可能眞的轉瞬即逝

184
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:29,000
但如果我們把握機會，全心投入

185
00:12:29,625 --> 00:12:31,750
那我們就眞的可以說我們不枉此生

186
00:12:31,833 --> 00:12:37,375
詩可以用敎的，但其實應該親身體驗

187
00:12:37,458 --> 00:12:41,000
應該實際嘗試與參與

188
00:12:41,083 --> 00:12:44,041
接受挑戰，讓詩改變你的人生

189
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:50,333
所以照這個精神
我這堂課衹會敎你們一件事

190
00:12:50,833 --> 00:12:52,375
有人猜得到嗎？

191
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:57,500
要吃蛋糕？

192
00:13:01,333 --> 00:13:02,625
有機會就吃

193
00:13:06,416 --> 00:13:09,375
寄電郵給我約時間進行輔導

194
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:13,500
可以跟你談嗎？

195
00:13:21,583 --> 00:13:23,583
所以你是我的美國文科碩士生

196
00:13:24,083 --> 00:13:26,625
而你不是我要來找的那位敎授

197
00:13:27,416 --> 00:13:29,875
不，但我衹是在史黛安敎授沒空時

198
00:13:29,958 --> 00:13:31,666
幫她代課

199
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:34,166
她其實很懶惰，很抱歉讓你失望了

200
00:13:34,875 --> 00:13:36,000
我的確很失望

201
00:13:39,583 --> 00:13:40,875
前幾天…

202
00:13:42,125 --> 00:13:46,666
-我通常不會躱在薯條店裡
-還害人濺得滿身濕

203
00:13:47,625 --> 00:13:48,708
我大錯特錯

204
00:13:49,416 --> 00:13:51,375
我眞的無意

205
00:13:51,458 --> 00:13:55,416
辦個即興濕T恤比賽

206
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:58,500
但如果有，你一定會贏

207
00:14:00,083 --> 00:14:02,375
我不該討論濕T恤比賽的

208
00:14:02,458 --> 00:14:03,500
沒參加過

209
00:14:04,041 --> 00:14:04,875
很明顯

210
00:14:06,291 --> 00:14:07,125
有次…

211
00:14:10,458 --> 00:14:11,958
我其實很成熟

212
00:14:13,583 --> 00:14:15,666
還眞讓人放心

213
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:21,208
-我也是
-恭喜，達文波特敎授

214
00:14:21,291 --> 00:14:23,625
-你的第一堂課
-你要吃蛋糕嗎？

215
00:14:24,125 --> 00:14:27,083
當然嫑
你上次看到我吃蛋糕是什麼時候？

216
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:28,416
我的生日？

217
00:14:37,291 --> 00:14:38,166
安娜

218
00:14:39,208 --> 00:14:42,041
-嘿
-剛入學就跟性感敎師眉來眼去？

219
00:14:42,125 --> 00:14:44,208
-什麼？不，我…
-別緊張，我欣賞你

220
00:14:44,291 --> 00:14:45,708
你有腳踏車嗎？

221
00:14:45,791 --> 00:14:46,625
沒有

222
00:14:46,708 --> 00:14:48,750
在牛津唸書一定要有腳踏車

223
00:14:48,833 --> 00:14:51,625
好，上車，我有人脈

224
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:54,125
-這樣騎得穩嗎？
-不太穩

225
00:14:54,208 --> 00:14:55,666
很危險

226
00:14:56,708 --> 00:14:58,458
我在後面跟著你就好

227
00:14:58,541 --> 00:15:00,125
希望你腳程很快

228
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:01,875
自求多福啦

229
00:15:03,541 --> 00:15:04,416
瑪姬！

230
00:15:16,041 --> 00:15:16,875
來了！

231
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:21,333
聖母瑪利亞啊！天啊，不會又來了吧

232
00:15:23,416 --> 00:15:25,583
你好，唐姆，還好嗎？

233
00:15:25,666 --> 00:15:28,458
哈格里夫斯的疾病分類書籍
剛好掉在我的蹠骨上

234
00:15:28,541 --> 00:15:30,125
一定很痛，眞諷刺

235
00:15:30,708 --> 00:15:32,500
這是安娜，她來自美國

236
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,583
安娜，我們註定
會成為朋友還是戀人？

237
00:15:36,375 --> 00:15:38,375
-朋友
-你非常確定？

238
00:15:38,458 --> 00:15:39,833
-很確定
-百分之百？

239
00:15:39,916 --> 00:15:42,041
-朋友
-天啊，好冷酷

240
00:15:42,833 --> 00:15:44,583
最美的對像往往心腸也最狠

241
00:15:44,666 --> 00:15:47,041
-不一定吧
-請進

242
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:52,208
-我出借的那本書在你那邊…
-不在

243
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:00,458
天啊

244
00:16:00,541 --> 00:16:01,500
在這裡

245
00:16:03,125 --> 00:16:04,375
公爵夫人

246
00:16:04,458 --> 00:16:08,208
好，天啊，好有英國風

247
00:16:08,291 --> 00:16:11,583
-這算是…優點？
-沒錯

248
00:16:11,666 --> 00:16:15,416
如果你愛英國風
我有最適合你的夜晚娛樂

249
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,458
歡迎収看《裸體吸引》

250
00:16:17,541 --> 00:16:19,916
這個相親節目喜歡讓大家袒裎相見

251
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,166
非常幽默經典，顛覆傳統

252
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:26,041
她說得對
《裸體吸引》的確很顛覆傳統

253
00:16:26,125 --> 00:16:29,458
不，我是說伊莉莎白巴雷特白朗寧的
《男人的要求》

254
00:16:30,166 --> 00:16:31,000
你們聽

255
00:16:31,083 --> 00:16:34,916
「所以，親愛的
如果你能證明女人的愛非謊言」

256
00:16:35,958 --> 00:16:39,583
「我會如同男人的能耐一樣
愛你半年」

257
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:41,958
哪裡顛覆傳統？

258
00:16:42,041 --> 00:16:45,500
她在嘲笑一八零零年
停止成長，並開始濫交的男人

259
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:49,833
寫得超棒
很適合達文波特敎授的作業

260
00:16:50,541 --> 00:16:51,833
我要寄給他

261
00:16:54,083 --> 00:16:57,875
天啊，她眞的很有熱忱
她還沒看到參賽者的屌就離開了

262
00:16:58,458 --> 00:16:59,583
出現了

263
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:15,791
請你離開

264
00:17:15,875 --> 00:17:16,708
好吧

265
00:17:17,291 --> 00:17:19,083
你最好出現，聽到了嗎？

266
00:17:33,125 --> 00:17:34,000
抱歉

267
00:17:35,208 --> 00:17:36,250
-我晚點再來
-不用

268
00:17:37,416 --> 00:17:38,916
不用，進來吧，請坐

269
00:17:54,166 --> 00:17:56,750
你覺得你的報告寫得如何？

270
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,250
我認為我提供了
很深入的見解、觀察和分析

271
00:18:06,666 --> 00:18:08,458
你覺得我的報告寫得如何？

272
00:18:09,416 --> 00:18:11,750
報告？感覺就衹是制式報告

273
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:18,583
你用三千字討論了
爭取婦女選舉權者、女性主義的誕生

274
00:18:19,166 --> 00:18:20,250
塞冷女巫狩獵

275
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:24,000
眞是了不起，但就是不符合作業要旨

276
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:28,416
好吧

277
00:18:29,375 --> 00:18:31,333
我再回去改寫

278
00:18:33,416 --> 00:18:34,250
等下，別走

279
00:18:35,833 --> 00:18:36,750
很抱歉

280
00:18:40,083 --> 00:18:42,833
重新開始吧，很抱歉

281
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:46,083
今天早晨渾身不對勁

282
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:55,791
書裡有這麼多首詩
你為什麼…選了這首？

283
00:18:56,541 --> 00:18:58,458
我想這道出了男人的眞面目

284
00:18:59,041 --> 00:19:02,583
你認為男人衹能愛一個女人六個月？

285
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:05,125
有些男人是這樣沒錯

286
00:19:05,208 --> 00:19:07,958
可是如果他們那段期間

287
00:19:08,708 --> 00:19:09,583
愛得很深呢？

288
00:19:09,666 --> 00:19:14,375
你覺得永恆的事物才有意義？

289
00:19:14,958 --> 00:19:15,791
那當然

290
00:19:18,583 --> 00:19:20,333
我認為你選這首詩

291
00:19:20,416 --> 00:19:23,375
是因為你認為它描述了我的特點

292
00:19:23,458 --> 00:19:24,666
這眞令人失望

293
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:27,500
因為我本來是想了解你

294
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:33,041
請選另一首詩
挑第一首…讓你很有共鳴的詩

295
00:19:54,666 --> 00:19:55,500
找到了嗎？

296
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:57,583
好極了

297
00:20:07,666 --> 00:20:11,541
「啊，親愛的，讓我們彼此眞誠」

298
00:20:12,541 --> 00:20:16,500
「因為我們眼前的世界
宛如夢想之地」

299
00:20:17,458 --> 00:20:20,166
「如此多變、美麗與新穎」

300
00:20:20,708 --> 00:20:23,333
「卻其實沒有歡喜、愛或光」

301
00:20:24,916 --> 00:20:27,833
「遑論安定或平靜」

302
00:20:28,708 --> 00:20:30,125
「也無法減輕痛苦」

303
00:20:30,708 --> 00:20:32,916
「我們在逐漸被黑闇席捲的平原上」

304
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:37,125
「周遭盡是
混亂的掙扎與驚逃警笛聲」

305
00:20:37,208 --> 00:20:39,708
「不清楚狀況的軍隊在夜間廝殺」

306
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:44,500
不經思考
立刻說出馬修阿諾德寫這首詩的用意

307
00:20:46,458 --> 00:20:50,083
我認為眞實人生極其辛苦

308
00:20:52,166 --> 00:20:53,625
但至少我們還有彼此

309
00:20:55,833 --> 00:20:56,666
眞是佩服

310
00:20:56,750 --> 00:21:00,791
你在維多利亞時代最悲觀的詩裡

311
00:21:00,875 --> 00:21:02,166
找到了希望

312
00:21:03,208 --> 00:21:04,875
你現在對我有所了解了

313
00:21:07,125 --> 00:21:09,416
-我剛接到你爸的電話…
-天啊

314
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:11,750
-不，是我不好
-很抱歉

315
00:21:12,958 --> 00:21:14,041
-嗨，西西莉亞
-嗨

316
00:21:14,125 --> 00:21:15,875
-我們剛好…討論完了
-對

317
00:21:15,958 --> 00:21:17,625
-謝謝
-謝謝，對

318
00:21:19,375 --> 00:21:21,875
-課堂上見，抱歉，好
-對

319
00:21:26,916 --> 00:21:27,750
安娜

320
00:21:28,791 --> 00:21:31,583
我們註意到你沒去過酒吧

321
00:21:31,666 --> 00:21:32,500
沒錯

322
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:35,083
太可恥了，立刻穿上鞋跟我們走

323
00:21:36,458 --> 00:21:37,750
不對，不是那雙鞋

324
00:21:40,458 --> 00:21:41,708
酒吧就像敎堂

325
00:21:41,791 --> 00:21:44,666
衹是我們把那裡當聖地，還定期朝聖

326
00:21:48,208 --> 00:21:49,958
敬新朋友安娜

327
00:21:50,041 --> 00:21:52,625
從五千五百公里外

328
00:21:52,708 --> 00:21:55,750
跑來有九百廿九年歷史的學校唸書，乾杯

329
00:21:56,458 --> 00:21:57,958
-乾杯！
-乾了！

330
00:22:00,541 --> 00:22:03,500
天啊，這件衣服癢死我了，幫我拿著

331
00:22:06,333 --> 00:22:08,750
角度怎麼抓都不對

332
00:22:08,833 --> 00:22:12,208
-你是第一次穿毛衣嗎？
-我們得談唐姆嗎？

333
00:22:12,708 --> 00:22:14,291
對喔，你喜歡他嗎？

334
00:22:14,375 --> 00:22:15,416
不喜歡，但你很喜歡

335
00:22:16,958 --> 00:22:18,875
就是啊，我覺得他超屌

336
00:22:18,958 --> 00:22:20,750
你拿屌來形容他？

337
00:22:20,833 --> 00:22:22,458
不，這是讚美

338
00:22:25,125 --> 00:22:26,166
大家好

339
00:22:27,416 --> 00:22:30,666
你一到牛津
大家都很興奮，你眞的很新鮮

340
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:33,625
我來介紹幾個黃金單身漢吧

341
00:22:33,708 --> 00:22:35,416
你應該還單身吧

342
00:22:36,083 --> 00:22:36,916
來

343
00:22:39,541 --> 00:22:41,958
牛津的男生都很聰明

344
00:22:42,041 --> 00:22:43,041
你誤會了

345
00:22:43,125 --> 00:22:44,916
不，我完全懂你的意思

346
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,291
你是說所有美國人都很蠢

347
00:22:47,375 --> 00:22:52,625
不對！你們很坦率、天眞

348
00:22:52,708 --> 00:22:55,166
我剛好覺得很可愛

349
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:58,375
我們到底是對什麼事
天眞到礙了你的眼？

350
00:22:58,958 --> 00:23:00,041
瑣碎的小事

351
00:23:00,125 --> 00:23:02,541
地理、世界歷史

352
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:04,583
你們的槍枝文化

353
00:23:04,666 --> 00:23:09,208
你們對其他國家的影響
即便無知，還故意張揚

354
00:23:09,291 --> 00:23:10,833
你喝醉了，伊恩，回去吧

355
00:23:10,916 --> 00:23:15,666
你們也聽不懂諷刺和挖苦

356
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:17,208
沒錯，批評得很合理

357
00:23:18,375 --> 00:23:20,625
或許你可以敎我諷刺

358
00:23:21,125 --> 00:23:22,833
你肯定是個好老師

359
00:23:22,916 --> 00:23:24,000
我眞的很厲害

360
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:26,833
我或許能幫你

361
00:23:29,166 --> 00:23:31,583
小瑪，我要去洗手間

362
00:23:31,666 --> 00:23:32,541
是廁所才對

363
00:23:33,208 --> 00:23:35,208
-廁所
-她讓你很沒面子，老兄

364
00:23:40,125 --> 00:23:41,208
嘿，墨西哥小姐

365
00:23:43,291 --> 00:23:44,791
靠多元名額入學的小妞

366
00:23:49,166 --> 00:23:50,375
你有話要對我說嗎？

367
00:23:51,833 --> 00:23:53,916
我們都知道你是來湊數的

368
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,791
如果你請我喝杯酒，我就原諒你

369
00:23:58,291 --> 00:23:59,750
搶走更有資格入學者的名額

370
00:24:05,125 --> 00:24:06,625
喝我這杯吧？

371
00:24:09,708 --> 00:24:14,041
小瑪，我要走了，我不喜歡這種地方

372
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,125
老兄，夠了

373
00:24:28,208 --> 00:24:29,916
我不需要救援，謝謝

374
00:24:30,416 --> 00:24:32,125
對，那當然，你眞的很嚇人

375
00:24:32,208 --> 00:24:34,583
但我要說清楚，我是在救他

376
00:24:35,791 --> 00:24:36,791
我走路送你回去？

377
00:24:37,541 --> 00:24:39,916
我能應付牛津危險的街頭

378
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,291
可能會出乎你的意料

379
00:24:41,791 --> 00:24:44,500
我指的是石像鬼，牠們晚上特別兇猛

380
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,458
牠們愛吃美國人

381
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,708
如果我說話太直，把牠們嚇跑呢？

382
00:24:49,791 --> 00:24:53,583
對，那絕對行得通
那對英國人來說是致命傷

383
00:24:54,083 --> 00:24:55,333
連石像鬼也受不了

384
00:24:58,375 --> 00:25:01,666
我可不想剝奪
你和那群女伴培養感情的時間

385
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:05,041
一群女伴湊在一起時
最大的特點就是非常能忍

386
00:25:10,833 --> 00:25:11,666
走吧？

387
00:25:15,708 --> 00:25:18,625
至少我第一次去英國酒吧的經驗
讓我永生難忘

388
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:21,958
那是你第一次去英國酒吧？

389
00:25:24,291 --> 00:25:25,291
那怎麼行

390
00:25:27,416 --> 00:25:30,208
安娜，你為什麼選擇來牛津？

391
00:25:30,291 --> 00:25:32,375
我是圖書館迷

392
00:25:34,833 --> 00:25:35,750
好

393
00:25:35,833 --> 00:25:38,583
我就是喜歡被書包圍的感覺

394
00:25:38,666 --> 00:25:41,708
世上最美妙的就是舊書的香味

395
00:25:43,083 --> 00:25:46,416
我十歲時
把菲力普普曼的小說都看完了

396
00:25:47,083 --> 00:25:48,666
而讓我念念不忘的

397
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:53,083
就是一個年輕女孩
穿梭魔幻古城的故事

398
00:25:53,166 --> 00:25:56,083
我就決定要設法

399
00:25:56,166 --> 00:26:00,125
來翻閱這些滿是灰塵的舊書及初版書

400
00:26:01,333 --> 00:26:03,666
抱歉，你十歲就開始計畫要來這裡？

401
00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:05,875
其實是十又四分之三歲

402
00:26:05,958 --> 00:26:07,791
好吧，好極了

403
00:26:07,875 --> 00:26:10,166
我父母總是說我的潛力無可限量

404
00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:13,583
所以我從沒想過要打消這個念頭

405
00:26:15,208 --> 00:26:16,458
他們一定以你為榮

406
00:26:16,541 --> 00:26:18,000
讓他們更引以為榮的

407
00:26:18,083 --> 00:26:20,333
是我早就找到金融分析師的工作了

408
00:26:20,416 --> 00:26:22,250
等我回去，就會去高盛任職

409
00:26:22,833 --> 00:26:23,833
分…

410
00:26:23,916 --> 00:26:26,500
我是個外行人
請問分析師的工作是什麼？

411
00:26:26,583 --> 00:26:29,875
主要是研究
深入調查公司與他們的賬目

412
00:26:29,958 --> 00:26:33,458
並整理資料，寫成報告給企業客戶

413
00:26:34,375 --> 00:26:37,083
聽起來還眞吸引人

414
00:26:37,166 --> 00:26:41,458
不是每個人都能用敎師薪水買古董車

415
00:26:42,125 --> 00:26:46,250
眞奇妙，我才在想
那個十歲的夢想家後來怎麼了

416
00:26:46,333 --> 00:26:48,000
她找到新的夢想

417
00:26:49,125 --> 00:26:51,583
想賺夠錢，不用再擔心沒錢用

418
00:26:52,291 --> 00:26:54,666
錢不能解決所有問題

419
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:57,166
眞的衹有有錢人才會說這句話

420
00:26:58,291 --> 00:26:59,791
我沒有任何經濟保障

421
00:26:59,875 --> 00:27:04,416
所以唸完大學跟牛津
就會進高盛，就這樣

422
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:07,708
-你都計畫好了
-你不覺得有這個必要嗎？

423
00:27:09,083 --> 00:27:10,833
如果想從容不迫地生活

424
00:27:13,291 --> 00:27:18,375
我覺得人生總有辦法
讓最周密的計畫出錯

425
00:27:19,041 --> 00:27:19,875
眞的嗎？

426
00:27:19,958 --> 00:27:21,625
我也認為

427
00:27:21,708 --> 00:27:25,333
生命中最精彩的一面
往往是那些挫折與動盪

428
00:27:27,416 --> 00:27:29,083
你是怎麼誤打誤撞來到這裡的？

429
00:27:29,958 --> 00:27:30,875
等下，我猜猜

430
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:32,500
預備學校

431
00:27:33,083 --> 00:27:33,958
請許多私人家敎

432
00:27:34,041 --> 00:27:35,708
伊頓公學、牛津

433
00:27:36,375 --> 00:27:39,458
-你怎麼知道我需要家敎？
-我說的是「許多家敎」

434
00:27:40,208 --> 00:27:43,291
這是卡拉OK之夜，開始唱歌吧

435
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:51,791
你自認為能唱得更好？

436
00:27:54,375 --> 00:27:57,416
我幾乎可以確定我可以唱得更好

437
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:59,750
你會唱歌嗎，達文波特敎授？

438
00:27:59,833 --> 00:28:01,458
我參加過樂團

439
00:28:02,041 --> 00:28:03,750
細菌滿溢

440
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:07,583
我們辦過兩場表演，所以我們蠻紅的

441
00:28:07,666 --> 00:28:09,000
起碼在這裡很紅

442
00:28:09,083 --> 00:28:12,000
這代表我請你喝酒
我就會變成追星族？

443
00:28:12,625 --> 00:28:14,833
對，應該是吧

444
00:28:15,416 --> 00:28:16,708
兩杯酒馬上來

445
00:28:28,333 --> 00:28:30,208
好，那唱得不怎麼樣

446
00:28:30,291 --> 00:28:31,458
嘿，謝謝

447
00:28:31,541 --> 00:28:34,541
接下來要演唱酷玩樂團《黃色》的是

448
00:28:34,625 --> 00:28:38,125
傑米達文波特！

449
00:28:38,708 --> 00:28:40,750
-什麼？
-你在哪裡，傑米？

450
00:28:40,833 --> 00:28:42,750
抱歉，安娜，你做了什麼好事？

451
00:28:42,833 --> 00:28:44,625
我剛幫你訂了第三場演出

452
00:28:44,708 --> 00:28:47,291
安娜，另外兩場是我十二歲的時候

453
00:28:47,375 --> 00:28:50,083
-你是傑米嗎？
-你有很多時間練習

454
00:28:50,166 --> 00:28:51,333
我是貝斯手

455
00:28:51,416 --> 00:28:52,416
那就祝你好運囉

456
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:53,625
你在哪裡，傑米？

457
00:28:53,708 --> 00:28:56,375
傑米！

458
00:28:56,458 --> 00:29:01,041
-不，安娜，說眞的，拜託，聽著…
-傑米…

459
00:29:01,125 --> 00:29:06,125
傑米…

460
00:29:09,583 --> 00:29:10,583
別害羞

461
00:29:52,416 --> 00:29:54,500
-不
-你聽過這首歌嗎？

462
00:30:42,583 --> 00:30:43,583
天啊

463
00:30:45,375 --> 00:30:49,875
我認為人不該為做過的事後悔

464
00:30:49,958 --> 00:30:52,333
衹應該為沒做的事後悔

465
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:54,750
對，但你得後悔剛才那場卡拉OK

466
00:30:54,833 --> 00:30:59,041
抱歉，我唯一後悔的是
沒加唱一首席琳狄翁的歌

467
00:30:59,833 --> 00:31:03,958
照本地傳統
唱完卡拉OK後就得吃東西

468
00:31:04,666 --> 00:31:09,458
我要介紹牛津眞正的經典

469
00:31:16,458 --> 00:31:17,958
那是象腿嗎？

470
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:22,666
餐點好囉

471
00:31:23,541 --> 00:31:24,583
謝謝

472
00:31:27,791 --> 00:31:28,625
相信我

473
00:31:44,833 --> 00:31:45,666
很好吃

474
00:31:46,708 --> 00:31:47,583
眞的很美味

475
00:31:49,666 --> 00:31:50,541
我的朋友

476
00:31:50,625 --> 00:31:51,583
謝謝，迪米崔

477
00:31:53,291 --> 00:31:54,958
-好好吃
-就是啊

478
00:31:58,750 --> 00:31:59,916
好了，換你了

479
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,583
對，看大師表演

480
00:32:03,833 --> 00:32:04,875
-來吧
-準備好了嗎？

481
00:32:04,958 --> 00:32:05,833
好了

482
00:32:11,541 --> 00:32:13,666
-糟糕
-天啊，我需要餐巾紙

483
00:32:13,750 --> 00:32:15,375
-你才不需要
-我很需要

484
00:32:15,458 --> 00:32:16,291
忍住

485
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,333
本來就會沾得到處都是

486
00:32:21,541 --> 00:32:22,375
試試看

487
00:32:23,458 --> 00:32:24,291
沒錯

488
00:32:29,333 --> 00:32:31,416
-超好吃
-很好吃吧？

489
00:32:34,333 --> 00:32:38,708
我來唸牛津時，絕對沒有預定要嘗試

490
00:32:38,791 --> 00:32:40,541
唱難聽的卡拉OK跟吃旋轉烤肉

491
00:32:41,333 --> 00:32:42,166
但是

492
00:32:43,833 --> 00:32:45,375
我玩得很開心

493
00:33:16,208 --> 00:33:17,458
那麼你想

494
00:33:19,208 --> 00:33:22,083
上來喝杯茶配烤餅嗎？

495
00:33:31,208 --> 00:33:32,041
還是嫑吧

496
00:33:38,416 --> 00:33:39,416
晚安，安娜

497
00:33:50,458 --> 00:33:53,583
你丟盡自己的臉，但你該放下了

498
00:33:53,666 --> 00:33:55,166
每個人都有類似的經驗

499
00:33:55,666 --> 00:33:58,000
-你有嗎？
-當然沒有，我衹是說說

500
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,333
雖然傑米達文波特拒絕你了

501
00:34:02,416 --> 00:34:05,541
但你這身打扮一定會引來關註

502
00:34:05,625 --> 00:34:07,625
不扮成這樣
就得扮露絲拜德金斯伯格法官

503
00:34:07,708 --> 00:34:10,833
-六零年代性感的露絲拜德？
-不是

504
00:34:11,958 --> 00:34:13,666
但這套裝扮很適合你

505
00:34:13,750 --> 00:34:16,333
有美國風，力量強大

506
00:34:16,416 --> 00:34:18,666
他們一定會很驚艷

507
00:34:18,750 --> 00:34:21,541
謝謝，你扮起德古拉也很帥

508
00:34:21,625 --> 00:34:24,208
德古拉？是安東尼柏捷頓，眞是的

509
00:34:36,375 --> 00:34:38,416
所以這不是變裝派對？

510
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,750
你好，神力女超人
快救我遠離那個傢夥

511
00:34:42,333 --> 00:34:44,291
不是你喜歡的類型？

512
00:34:44,375 --> 00:34:47,250
說眞的，我是出來玩的
我並不想討論分子生物學

513
00:34:47,333 --> 00:34:49,875
可以請你喝一杯嗎？
如果柏捷頓大人同意的話

514
00:34:50,416 --> 00:34:52,666
我完全允許

515
00:34:56,416 --> 00:34:59,250
我衹是不懂這哪算萬聖節派對

516
00:34:59,333 --> 00:35:01,750
這個國家的人都懶得變裝嗎？

517
00:35:01,833 --> 00:35:04,041
我變裝了啊

518
00:35:04,125 --> 00:35:06,666
我不是批評你
你看起來怪得很有魅力

519
00:35:06,750 --> 00:35:11,208
而你看起來像放蕩的人類救世主

520
00:35:11,291 --> 00:35:12,833
你說對了，安東尼

521
00:35:12,916 --> 00:35:16,041
我不介意搭你的隱形飛機

522
00:35:16,625 --> 00:35:19,208
-什麼？
-隱形飛機

523
00:35:19,916 --> 00:35:22,166
神奇女超人有一架隱形飛機

524
00:35:22,250 --> 00:35:25,208
可是看不見，因為是隱形飛機

525
00:35:25,916 --> 00:35:26,750
對喔

526
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:29,375
沒錯

527
00:35:34,666 --> 00:35:36,083
你想跳舞嗎？

528
00:35:36,750 --> 00:35:37,916
起飛了

529
00:36:21,666 --> 00:36:24,833
要是用力拉的時候
過度往後倒，那樣就錯了

530
00:36:24,916 --> 00:36:26,416
這會破壞協調性

531
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:29,416
頭重腳輕的人常遇到這種狀況

532
00:36:29,916 --> 00:36:30,750
天啊

533
00:36:31,416 --> 00:36:34,458
-快要比賽了嗎？
-沒有！

534
00:36:34,541 --> 00:36:36,208
不然我就不會出來玩了

535
00:36:36,875 --> 00:36:38,958
分毫之差就可能會輸掉比賽

536
00:36:42,458 --> 00:36:43,291
你沒事吧？

537
00:36:49,583 --> 00:36:50,458
過來

538
00:36:51,041 --> 00:36:52,125
我餓了

539
00:37:00,375 --> 00:37:01,250
有什麼好笑的？

540
00:37:01,833 --> 00:37:03,958
天啊，你是認眞的嗎？

541
00:37:05,250 --> 00:37:06,416
我不能吃那種東西

542
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:09,041
這樣就像幫勞斯萊斯加柴油

543
00:37:09,125 --> 00:37:11,000
而非高級無鉛汽油

544
00:37:13,458 --> 00:37:14,500
-你說得對
-對吧？

545
00:37:14,583 --> 00:37:16,458
我思慮不周

546
00:37:17,375 --> 00:37:18,208
晚安

547
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,958
-晚安，迪米崔
-晚安

548
00:37:25,291 --> 00:37:27,166
王爾德也是濟慈的忠實粉絲

549
00:37:27,250 --> 00:37:29,875
他無法接受有人販售濟慈的情書

550
00:37:29,958 --> 00:37:34,791
「那病態的小眼睛
可能會瞪著看，還沾沾自喜」

551
00:37:34,875 --> 00:37:36,583
今天就到這裡，謝謝各位

552
00:37:37,541 --> 00:37:39,208
對，我得把服裝拿去還

553
00:37:39,708 --> 00:37:40,833
開膛手傑克？

554
00:37:40,916 --> 00:37:43,041
才不是，安娜，你要來嗎？

555
00:37:49,208 --> 00:37:50,583
安娜，你有空嗎？

556
00:37:53,875 --> 00:37:56,166
如果你有空，我想帶你去看一樣東西

557
00:37:59,125 --> 00:38:00,375
我覺得很特別

558
00:38:09,333 --> 00:38:13,000
你以為我沒去過博德利圖書館？
那是我第二件想做的事情

559
00:38:13,083 --> 00:38:15,000
-僅次於？
-吃炸魚薯條

560
00:38:15,833 --> 00:38:19,750
但你去過深藏其中的圖書館嗎？

561
00:38:30,416 --> 00:38:32,791
歡迎來到漢弗萊公爵圖書館

562
00:38:40,625 --> 00:38:41,833
別碰，警報會響

563
00:38:46,166 --> 00:38:47,041
你好，蘿拉

564
00:38:47,625 --> 00:38:48,958
我幫你拿出來了，傑米

565
00:38:49,041 --> 00:38:49,875
謝謝

566
00:38:56,416 --> 00:38:58,041
看哪，這是祕密殿堂

567
00:39:20,416 --> 00:39:21,958
-是米萊的作品
-沒錯

568
00:39:24,750 --> 00:39:25,625
初版書

569
00:39:34,166 --> 00:39:36,000
-好香啊
-沒錯

570
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:38,041
天啊

571
00:39:39,708 --> 00:39:41,833
我昨晚在夜店看到你

572
00:39:42,875 --> 00:39:43,708
是嗎？

573
00:39:44,416 --> 00:39:46,625
我本來想打招呼的
不過我想你離開了

574
00:39:46,708 --> 00:39:50,166
找不到你或跟你在一起的蠢划船手

575
00:39:54,041 --> 00:39:55,416
我們一起離開的

576
00:39:55,916 --> 00:39:58,625
你忙著跟西西莉亞調情
一定沒註意到吧

577
00:39:59,416 --> 00:40:01,791
-印了幾本？
-你直接回家？

578
00:40:01,875 --> 00:40:02,750
沒有

579
00:40:03,583 --> 00:40:04,416
明白了

580
00:40:06,666 --> 00:40:07,916
那他就是去吃烤餅了？

581
00:40:08,583 --> 00:40:09,583
沒有

582
00:40:10,666 --> 00:40:12,500
-我們去了迪米崔的餐車
-什麼？

583
00:40:13,625 --> 00:40:18,166
…大多數人都不知道印了一百廿六本書

584
00:40:19,333 --> 00:40:20,916
迪米崔的餐車是我們的祕密基地

585
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:23,375
我們的？

586
00:40:25,416 --> 00:40:26,708
意思是我和你？

587
00:40:34,833 --> 00:40:36,166
這是什麼時候印刷的

588
00:40:37,625 --> 00:40:38,458
敎授？

589
00:40:38,958 --> 00:40:40,083
是…

590
00:40:40,750 --> 00:40:41,583
是…

591
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:44,333
一九…

592
00:40:44,916 --> 00:40:45,791
一九…

593
00:40:47,750 --> 00:40:48,708
一九一七年

594
00:40:50,291 --> 00:40:51,375
對

595
00:40:51,958 --> 00:40:52,833
一九一七年

596
00:41:08,250 --> 00:41:10,875
-謝謝，蘿拉，我得先走
-這本書很棒

597
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:25,958
現在要去哪裡？

598
00:41:26,041 --> 00:41:27,250
就是…找個地方

599
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:37,833
去你家？

600
00:41:38,375 --> 00:41:39,333
不行

601
00:41:40,083 --> 00:41:41,000
太遠了

602
00:41:44,083 --> 00:41:46,250
敞篷多快可以昇起？

603
00:41:54,458 --> 00:41:55,833
謝謝你送我

604
00:41:56,666 --> 00:41:57,500
回家

605
00:42:03,250 --> 00:42:07,000
別怪我太直接
但我們衹是玩玩，對吧？

606
00:42:07,083 --> 00:42:07,916
沒錯

607
00:42:08,458 --> 00:42:09,833
-玩玩而已
-玩玩而已

608
00:42:09,916 --> 00:42:11,541
-玩玩
-玩玩

609
00:42:11,625 --> 00:42:12,958
-玩得很開心
-玩得很開心

610
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:18,041
我也衹能玩玩
所以請把握機會好好享受

611
00:42:30,041 --> 00:42:31,291
我可以坐這裡嗎？

612
00:42:33,083 --> 00:42:33,916
當然可以

613
00:42:35,250 --> 00:42:36,958
眞奇妙，這是我們的名產

614
00:42:37,041 --> 00:42:40,083
但衹有遊客和我阿嬤會喝下午茶

615
00:42:43,625 --> 00:42:45,875
聽說你和傑米是一對

616
00:42:45,958 --> 00:42:49,750
也不算眞的是一對
我們衹是…在逢場作戲

617
00:42:49,833 --> 00:42:51,625
對，他很擅長

618
00:42:52,375 --> 00:42:53,791
但問題是，你也擅長嗎？

619
00:42:55,291 --> 00:42:57,875
我知道我們自認為是現代女性

620
00:42:57,958 --> 00:43:01,625
但歸根結底，很難不動眞感情

621
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:04,625
相信我，安娜

622
00:43:04,708 --> 00:43:06,125
不値得為他心痛

623
00:43:09,291 --> 00:43:10,208
喝茶吧

624
00:43:16,791 --> 00:43:19,708
我們說好這衹是在玩玩

625
00:43:19,791 --> 00:43:22,791
玩玩，好極了，還眞有趣！

626
00:43:22,875 --> 00:43:24,458
嫑再說「玩玩」了

627
00:43:24,541 --> 00:43:25,750
可是樂趣無窮啊

628
00:43:25,833 --> 00:43:28,208
而且因為你會離開
這段關係本來就會結束

629
00:43:28,291 --> 00:43:31,541
沒錯，可能衹會持續一、兩個月

630
00:43:33,125 --> 00:43:35,291
好，你們猜哪一個
長得跟我前任一模一樣

631
00:44:12,583 --> 00:44:13,958
-安娜
-不行

632
00:44:14,041 --> 00:44:15,875
安娜，這是我的榮幸

633
00:44:50,333 --> 00:44:53,541
你們看
他們要去參加舞會，我也想去

634
00:44:57,625 --> 00:44:59,166
（爸）

635
00:45:01,250 --> 00:45:02,208
不，我不是…

636
00:45:02,291 --> 00:45:05,375
慶祝七百五十年的歷史，你卻不想去？

637
00:45:05,458 --> 00:45:06,791
-沒錯
-你眞無趣

638
00:45:06,875 --> 00:45:08,958
不，相信我，舞會很無聊

639
00:45:09,041 --> 00:45:11,958
我願意帶你去其他地方
不管哪裡都可以

640
00:45:12,541 --> 00:45:13,833
-哪裡都可以？
-對

641
00:45:13,916 --> 00:45:15,041
去你家呢？

642
00:45:15,125 --> 00:45:17,208
目前有致命的藤蔓

643
00:45:17,291 --> 00:45:18,750
-最好是
-有點…

644
00:45:20,375 --> 00:45:21,208
天啊

645
00:45:25,916 --> 00:45:27,416
（《十四行詩與愛人的怨訴》）

646
00:45:33,333 --> 00:45:36,000
（做我的情人？
我不是說聖瓦倫丁喔）

647
00:45:36,083 --> 00:45:38,583
（他被克勞狄二世斬首）

648
00:45:45,125 --> 00:45:49,416
安娜！你在為高盛的工作唸書嗎？

649
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:50,500
是啊

650
00:45:50,583 --> 00:45:52,083
要專心喔

651
00:45:52,666 --> 00:45:54,625
你的未來太重要了

652
00:45:57,541 --> 00:45:59,250
乾掉！

653
00:46:02,958 --> 00:46:03,791
（牛津撐船）

654
00:46:09,375 --> 00:46:11,625
還有其他來自…

655
00:46:15,750 --> 00:46:18,958
我衹是…我還是會像
沒見過世面的遊客一樣

656
00:46:19,458 --> 00:46:23,750
太不可思議了
雪萊、托爾金和王爾德

657
00:46:23,833 --> 00:46:25,750
都曾在這些花園裡漫步

658
00:46:25,833 --> 00:46:29,875
衹是我的國家沒有這麼豐富的歷史

659
00:46:31,041 --> 00:46:33,583
-對，但你們有其他優點
-是沒錯

660
00:46:34,250 --> 00:46:35,125
棒球

661
00:46:36,333 --> 00:46:37,833
超級大車

662
00:46:40,208 --> 00:46:41,333
說眞的，若你喜歡這裡

663
00:46:41,416 --> 00:46:44,541
那你一定要在離開之前

664
00:46:44,625 --> 00:46:45,833
去環遊歐洲

665
00:46:45,916 --> 00:46:46,750
環遊歐洲？

666
00:46:46,833 --> 00:46:49,125
對，就像拜倫，你得以巴黎為起點

667
00:46:49,208 --> 00:46:51,791
-當然要在塞納河畔喝醉
-那當然

668
00:46:52,375 --> 00:46:56,375
如果是我，我接著會去威尼斯
整晚待在貢多拉上

669
00:46:56,875 --> 00:46:59,708
然後我會去希臘參觀海神廟

670
00:46:59,791 --> 00:47:02,125
在高聳的海角上，俯瞰愛琴海

671
00:47:04,083 --> 00:47:06,541
然後我會坐在

672
00:47:07,625 --> 00:47:10,916
風光明媚的海灘上
就像丁尼生說的那樣

673
00:47:11,708 --> 00:47:14,125
將「夕陽與夜星」盡収眼底

674
00:47:15,166 --> 00:47:17,291
聽起來不是衹有我有計畫

675
00:47:18,041 --> 00:47:19,458
對，我可能有計畫

676
00:47:21,041 --> 00:47:22,041
但你一定要…

677
00:47:22,791 --> 00:47:26,250
你一定要去阿姆斯特丹的紅燈區

678
00:47:26,750 --> 00:47:28,125
我不喜歡那種地方

679
00:47:28,208 --> 00:47:29,416
不，那裡有

680
00:47:30,166 --> 00:47:31,541
一座敎堂

681
00:47:31,625 --> 00:47:32,958
閣樓上的吾主博物館

682
00:47:34,166 --> 00:47:37,375
有道闇門通往聖殿

683
00:47:41,875 --> 00:47:42,958
眞的很美

684
00:47:43,666 --> 00:47:44,916
令人屏息

685
00:47:50,291 --> 00:47:51,458
我們可以一起去

686
00:47:53,541 --> 00:47:54,375
一起？

687
00:47:57,083 --> 00:47:59,833
不曉得，敎授，那樣聽起來太認眞

688
00:48:00,333 --> 00:48:01,833
但我衹想玩玩

689
00:48:04,416 --> 00:48:06,083
我很快就要回紐約了

690
00:48:09,750 --> 00:48:10,791
對，沒錯

691
00:48:12,458 --> 00:48:16,583
或許嫑用環遊的，換成小旅行好了

692
00:48:18,458 --> 00:48:19,791
去我家

693
00:48:21,041 --> 00:48:22,125
你家？

694
00:48:23,541 --> 00:48:24,583
你有家？

695
00:48:24,666 --> 00:48:25,541
是啊

696
00:48:26,625 --> 00:48:27,458
眞沒想到

697
00:48:28,375 --> 00:48:31,291
天啊，過了這麼久
我還以為你以車為家

698
00:48:37,416 --> 00:48:39,416
別批評我，我還沒安頓下來

699
00:48:39,916 --> 00:48:43,083
我一年前才搬離校園

700
00:48:43,958 --> 00:48:46,083
我姑姑把房子留給我

701
00:48:46,708 --> 00:48:48,375
雖然是留給我，但她還沒死

702
00:48:48,458 --> 00:48:52,000
她衹是不想翻修

703
00:48:52,083 --> 00:48:54,583
當然就搬去克羅埃西亞了

704
00:48:54,666 --> 00:48:56,416
這些玩具車是你做的嗎？

705
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,125
是模型車

706
00:48:59,291 --> 00:49:03,500
不過對，是我小時候
和我爸及哥哥艾迪一起做的

707
00:49:04,541 --> 00:49:06,000
其實很難的

708
00:49:06,666 --> 00:49:09,333
我們三個打造每一輛車
都花了很多時間

709
00:49:10,375 --> 00:49:12,500
熬夜到很晚

710
00:49:13,500 --> 00:49:16,875
我長大後，我們開始玩眞車

711
00:49:17,375 --> 00:49:18,375
就像那輛捷豹？

712
00:49:18,875 --> 00:49:19,708
對，那…

713
00:49:24,833 --> 00:49:28,708
那是艾迪死前
我們處理的最後一輛車

714
00:49:29,375 --> 00:49:31,375
-天啊，很遺憾…
-眞奇妙

715
00:49:31,458 --> 00:49:34,583
家裡每個人都有自己的角色，對吧？

716
00:49:34,666 --> 00:49:37,333
他過世後，我發現我不衹失去了

717
00:49:38,125 --> 00:49:38,958
我哥哥

718
00:49:39,041 --> 00:49:43,250
也失去了和我父親溝通的方式

719
00:49:45,875 --> 00:49:47,375
你跟他談過這件事嗎？

720
00:49:47,458 --> 00:49:50,708
沒有，我們是英國人，安娜
我們不討論自己的感受

721
00:49:51,208 --> 00:49:52,041
對喔

722
00:49:52,125 --> 00:49:53,833
事實上，那可能是我第一次

723
00:49:53,916 --> 00:49:56,416
跟別人提到我跟我爸沒有來往

724
00:49:57,583 --> 00:50:00,125
-你哥哥是怎麼過世的？
-我們繼續參觀吧

725
00:50:01,625 --> 00:50:04,458
你還沒看過臥室，那有最棒的景色

726
00:50:07,416 --> 00:50:10,458
請小心點，我才剛鋪好地毯

727
00:50:24,833 --> 00:50:26,000
早安

728
00:50:29,375 --> 00:50:30,333
你要出門？

729
00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:34,000
對，我忘了要處理一件事

730
00:50:35,083 --> 00:50:38,166
史黛安給了我另一個責任

731
00:50:39,666 --> 00:50:42,083
在某種程度上，我也是

732
00:50:42,166 --> 00:50:43,916
史黛安交給你的責任

733
00:50:47,291 --> 00:50:48,291
抱歉

734
00:50:51,083 --> 00:50:53,500
瑪姬傳訊提到下週末有划船賽

735
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,083
要跟我們一起去嗎？

736
00:50:57,125 --> 00:50:58,291
抱歉，你說什麼？

737
00:50:58,958 --> 00:51:00,666
下週末的划船賽

738
00:51:02,791 --> 00:51:03,916
你要來嗎？

739
00:51:05,958 --> 00:51:08,333
我應該沒辦法

740
00:51:08,416 --> 00:51:11,041
我接下來幾週會很忙

741
00:51:11,125 --> 00:51:13,875
我得專心寫博士論文

742
00:51:15,208 --> 00:51:17,000
對喔，那當然

743
00:51:20,041 --> 00:51:21,416
我去換衣服

744
00:51:23,750 --> 00:51:25,083
好，好極了，謝謝

745
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,875
牛津！

746
00:51:37,958 --> 00:51:38,833
（劍橋）

747
00:51:50,625 --> 00:51:52,208
（牛津）

748
00:52:07,916 --> 00:52:10,166
打敗他們，牛津！

749
00:52:16,625 --> 00:52:18,875
（傑米達文波特
「抱歉，又去圖書館了」）

750
00:52:18,958 --> 00:52:20,416
（「玩得開心，記得喝醉」）

751
00:52:21,875 --> 00:52:22,750
他會來嗎？

752
00:52:23,250 --> 00:52:26,208
他沒辦法來，他在唸書
我一個禮拜沒見到他了

753
00:52:26,291 --> 00:52:27,833
如果可以的話，他一定會來的

754
00:52:28,333 --> 00:52:30,708
他的論文很重要，我懂

755
00:52:30,791 --> 00:52:34,208
-蘿拉！嘿
-嘿！來了好多人

756
00:52:34,291 --> 00:52:37,250
對，除了傑米，大家都來了

757
00:52:37,958 --> 00:52:41,958
不過你一定厭倦
看到他每天都待在圖書館

758
00:52:42,041 --> 00:52:43,791
不會，我好幾週沒見到傑米了

759
00:52:48,500 --> 00:52:51,958
我要擠進人群裡點啤酒
你們要喝點什麼嗎？

760
00:52:52,541 --> 00:52:54,458
-我不用，謝謝
-好

761
00:52:58,416 --> 00:53:00,583
可能衹是單純誤會

762
00:53:00,666 --> 00:53:02,916
傑米不是那種會四處留情的人

763
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:05,458
你早就知道他是個花花公子

764
00:53:05,541 --> 00:53:09,208
你說你想要玩玩
這完全符合你的需求

765
00:53:09,291 --> 00:53:11,125
西西莉亞警告我離他遠一點

766
00:53:11,208 --> 00:53:15,250
警告的意思是關心你一下
還是恐嚇你？

767
00:53:16,875 --> 00:53:18,666
天啊，她是在恐嚇我

768
00:53:19,833 --> 00:53:20,750
她在這裡嗎？

769
00:53:21,541 --> 00:53:22,541
你在找我嗎？

770
00:53:22,625 --> 00:53:25,541
你好，雷德利
西西莉亞今天沒跟你們一起來嗎？

771
00:53:25,625 --> 00:53:28,166
她決定要待在家裡做點正事

772
00:53:28,250 --> 00:53:30,458
可是錯過划船賽？眞該被退學

773
00:53:30,958 --> 00:53:35,041
女子隊獲勝的差距
跟我賭的距離一樣，一百卌公尺

774
00:53:35,125 --> 00:53:36,625
我剛贏了五百鎊

775
00:53:36,708 --> 00:53:38,750
-天啊
-我請大家喝啤酒

776
00:53:39,333 --> 00:53:41,083
-走吧
-去酒吧

777
00:53:41,583 --> 00:53:42,958
大家要喝什麼？

778
00:53:44,291 --> 00:53:47,000
如果他想跟別人交往，我也可以接受

779
00:53:47,083 --> 00:53:48,833
-那當然
-但不能騙我

780
00:53:49,333 --> 00:53:50,375
-對
-對

781
00:53:50,458 --> 00:53:51,291
-對
-對

782
00:53:51,375 --> 00:53:53,625
對，管他的，上門去找他

783
00:53:54,208 --> 00:53:56,291
-我知道密碼
-那樣更好，自己開門進去

784
00:53:56,375 --> 00:53:57,250
沒錯

785
00:53:58,833 --> 00:53:59,958
「敢」他的

786
00:54:00,500 --> 00:54:02,333
-「敢」他的？
-對

787
00:54:02,416 --> 00:54:03,750
「敢」他的

788
00:54:36,250 --> 00:54:37,083
傑米？

789
00:54:39,125 --> 00:54:40,500
我去倒杯咖啡

790
00:54:41,291 --> 00:54:42,250
你要喝嗎？

791
00:54:43,333 --> 00:54:45,083
你一定累壞了

792
00:54:50,166 --> 00:54:51,166
天啊

793
00:54:51,250 --> 00:54:52,791
不，安娜，等下，安娜…

794
00:54:52,875 --> 00:54:54,166
（化療，謹慎處理）

795
00:55:00,208 --> 00:55:01,375
-這是在什麼？
-出去

796
00:55:01,958 --> 00:55:04,250
-傑米…
-出…去！

797
00:55:42,708 --> 00:55:49,708
（希薇亞普拉斯）

798
00:56:01,250 --> 00:56:03,250
艾迪得了癌癥

799
00:56:05,041 --> 00:56:09,375
他們什麼都試過了，每種…療法

800
00:56:09,458 --> 00:56:10,750
每種臨床試驗

801
00:56:11,375 --> 00:56:13,875
最後他衹想停止

802
00:56:14,458 --> 00:56:18,583
因為這為他爭取了時間
但他都在醫院痛苦地度過

803
00:56:19,750 --> 00:56:22,416
那不叫延長壽命，衹是慢一點死去

804
00:56:24,791 --> 00:56:25,750
我父親

805
00:56:26,250 --> 00:56:27,916
是個怎麼都不肯認輸的人

806
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:31,083
他不明白為什麼別人
不想戰鬥到最後一刻

807
00:56:31,166 --> 00:56:33,333
但有些事情就是…

808
00:56:33,833 --> 00:56:37,208
你贏不了的
就像身體跟你作對的時候一樣

809
00:56:42,208 --> 00:56:43,083
衹是我…

810
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,750
我不明白你是怎麼面對這一切的

811
00:56:47,833 --> 00:56:49,625
有西西莉亞在我身邊

812
00:56:50,291 --> 00:56:52,333
她是艾迪的女友

813
00:56:53,125 --> 00:56:55,625
她從頭到尾都陪著他

814
00:56:56,875 --> 00:56:58,250
我們現在基本上是一家人

815
00:57:00,583 --> 00:57:02,000
你媽還好嗎？

816
00:57:02,708 --> 00:57:05,458
對，不太好，但她已經做得很好了

817
00:57:07,750 --> 00:57:10,541
不像我父親，她從不自我中心

818
00:57:11,375 --> 00:57:13,666
甚至在艾迪快死的時候，他…

819
00:57:14,750 --> 00:57:17,291
他衹能不斷逼艾迪
我們當時為了這件事爭吵

820
00:57:18,750 --> 00:57:19,875
我們對彼此都很不客氣

821
00:57:22,916 --> 00:57:23,750
總之

822
00:57:24,708 --> 00:57:26,333
我現在也遇上同樣的情況

823
00:57:26,416 --> 00:57:27,791
這是遺傳

824
00:57:28,541 --> 00:57:30,500
你看到的是我最後一次治療

825
00:57:30,583 --> 00:57:33,583
或許這能幫我爭取時間，或許不行

826
00:57:34,166 --> 00:57:37,625
但不管如何
我不會再接受更多療程了

827
00:57:38,916 --> 00:57:44,125
但…我父親無法尊重那個選擇

828
00:57:55,416 --> 00:57:59,791
（迪米崔旋轉烤肉）

829

我死前最後一餐想吃這個

830
00:58:09,875 --> 00:58:10,958
你呢？

831
00:58:15,541 --> 00:58:17,041
這有什麼好笑的？

832
00:58:22,208 --> 00:58:23,500
好笑是因為

833
00:58:24,541 --> 00:58:28,125
這座城裡最需要逢場作戲的兩個人

834
00:58:28,208 --> 00:58:29,125
最後居然變成這樣

835
00:58:34,583 --> 00:58:37,375
你在牛津剩下的時間不多
別浪費在我身上

836
00:58:39,958 --> 00:58:42,458
我看到西西莉亞陪伴艾迪的過程

837
00:58:44,333 --> 00:58:45,750
我不想讓你吃這種苦

838
00:58:48,708 --> 00:58:50,958
我們說要玩玩，也的確相處得很愉快

839
00:58:52,416 --> 00:58:53,291
無比開心

840
00:58:54,791 --> 00:58:56,291
但我的病不好玩

841
00:58:56,375 --> 00:58:57,916
所以就到此為止吧

842
00:59:00,916 --> 00:59:01,916
以旋轉烤肉劃下句點

843
00:59:13,083 --> 00:59:17,041
衹因為有些東西轉瞬即逝
不代表沒有意義

844
00:59:21,708 --> 00:59:24,000
我無法假裝我明白你經歷了什麼痛苦

845
00:59:24,083 --> 00:59:26,375
但我知道但你不必獨自承受

846
00:59:29,166 --> 00:59:31,333
這是人生的挫折與動盪

847
00:59:31,916 --> 00:59:35,041
正如一個討厭的聰明人
有次跟我說的一樣…

848
00:59:37,833 --> 00:59:39,458
這也是人生最精彩的一面

849
01:00:16,875 --> 01:00:18,458
情況並沒有改變

850
01:00:18,541 --> 01:00:20,916
繼續逢場作戲吧

851
01:00:22,208 --> 01:00:23,041
對

852
01:00:24,250 --> 01:00:25,583
我們繼續逢場作戲

853
01:00:29,666 --> 01:00:31,583
嫑！

854
01:00:37,583 --> 01:00:40,125
（看起來很有趣，售罄）

855
01:00:41,875 --> 01:00:43,583
-史黛安敎授
-什麼事？

856
01:00:44,250 --> 01:00:50,125
抱歉，你是七百五十週年
舞會委員會的成員，對吧？

857
01:00:50,208 --> 01:00:51,291
是啊

858
01:00:51,375 --> 01:00:53,833
我也知道你蔑視所有…

859
01:00:53,916 --> 01:00:55,000
是怎麼說的？

860
01:00:55,083 --> 01:00:57,916
佯裝成高品味
但其實俗氣又無格調的人事物？

861
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,666
對，很像我的語氣，對吧？

862
01:01:01,666 --> 01:01:02,541
可是…

863
01:01:11,916 --> 01:01:15,208
我衹想請問你那種握法…

864
01:01:16,583 --> 01:01:17,416
你們幹嘛？

865
01:01:18,500 --> 01:01:21,791
天啊！等下，我們都可以去嗎？

866
01:01:37,666 --> 01:01:38,958
-嘿
-怎麼樣？

867
01:01:39,041 --> 01:01:40,416
我會陪在你身旁

868
01:01:48,208 --> 01:01:49,666
-你好，媽媽
-你好，親愛的

869
01:01:49,750 --> 01:01:51,208
你看起來眞漂亮

870
01:01:51,291 --> 01:01:52,375
謝謝

871
01:01:52,458 --> 01:01:55,541
我要把自己灌醉
然後去搭他媽的摩天輪

872
01:01:56,333 --> 01:02:00,333
請見見我的朋友安娜

873
01:02:00,416 --> 01:02:04,000
對，我聽說我兒子
在跟一個很漂亮的美國女孩約會

874
01:02:04,083 --> 01:02:07,291
對，我也聽說了，先生
但我並沒有因此卻步

875
01:02:07,375 --> 01:02:10,291
不好意思，可以談嗎
達文波特夫人？

876
01:02:10,375 --> 01:02:11,458
當然可以

877
01:02:12,375 --> 01:02:13,916
抱歉，眞無聊

878
01:02:16,958 --> 01:02:20,250
傑米，如果我們可以…

879
01:02:36,375 --> 01:02:38,791
我們註定會成為朋友

880
01:02:39,416 --> 01:02:40,583
還是戀人？

881
01:02:40,666 --> 01:02:41,500
都不會

882
01:02:42,375 --> 01:02:43,208
唐姆！

883
01:02:43,291 --> 01:02:44,666
還有第三種選擇

884
01:02:45,166 --> 01:02:47,958
安娜，你看起來眞是…

885
01:02:53,333 --> 01:02:54,541
她很美吧？

886
01:02:55,416 --> 01:02:58,375
可惜要打扮一下，男人才會註意到

887
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:03,375
什麼？你以為我看瑪姬
看到出神了嗎？

888
01:03:03,458 --> 01:03:06,375
你能想像嗎？不，瑪姬和我衹是…

889
01:03:07,791 --> 01:03:08,625
普通朋友

890
01:03:08,708 --> 01:03:09,750
這種關係最好

891
01:03:09,833 --> 01:03:11,666
不動眞感情就不會傷心

892
01:03:41,333 --> 01:03:42,166
你好，安娜

893
01:03:44,250 --> 01:03:45,750
可以請你喝酒嗎？

894
01:03:50,291 --> 01:03:52,000
當然可以，我很樂意

895
01:03:55,833 --> 01:03:59,041
所以我媽從阿根廷來的時候一無所有

896
01:03:59,125 --> 01:04:01,541
我爸是古巴流亡者

897
01:04:02,250 --> 01:04:04,500
現在他們的女兒
卻在牛津攻讀碩士學位

898
01:04:04,583 --> 01:04:06,416
而且很快就要進高盛工作了

899
01:04:07,666 --> 01:04:08,875
你調查過我了

900
01:04:08,958 --> 01:04:13,708
雖然傑米不想理我
但幸好他還會跟媽媽聯絡

901
01:04:15,500 --> 01:04:18,000
我得老實跟你說，安娜

902
01:04:18,500 --> 01:04:21,416
我希望傑米接受最好的醫療

903
01:04:21,500 --> 01:04:23,041
但他得有鬥志

904
01:04:23,125 --> 01:04:27,083
他現在不理我
所以我無法提供他細節

905
01:04:27,666 --> 01:04:30,625
傑米看到艾迪的經歷

906
01:04:30,708 --> 01:04:33,750
所以我…想他知道治療的事，先生

907
01:04:34,250 --> 01:04:35,708
不是全部都知道，怎麼可能？

908
01:04:36,291 --> 01:04:38,708
他和艾迪罹患非常罕見的疾病

909
01:04:39,708 --> 01:04:42,041
我一直在四處打聽

910
01:04:42,916 --> 01:04:46,166
捐款、贊助研究

911
01:04:47,666 --> 01:04:51,000
我無法想像你有多難受

912
01:04:51,083 --> 01:04:53,166
傑米認為他最懂，但是

913
01:04:54,583 --> 01:04:55,416
他不懂

914
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,916
他表面上很健康，但其實不是

915
01:05:00,041 --> 01:05:03,250
他得回我們家去接受更多治療

916
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:06,916
我希望你能幫我們說服他

917
01:05:09,833 --> 01:05:12,333
很高興我們達成了共識

918
01:05:19,458 --> 01:05:23,416
傑米說艾德華過世時
你們對彼此都很不客氣

919
01:05:26,166 --> 01:05:27,500
你那時跟他說了什麼？

920
01:05:29,250 --> 01:05:30,541
你居然敢評判我？

921
01:05:33,958 --> 01:05:38,375
你曾看著自己如此珍愛的人死去嗎？

922
01:05:42,041 --> 01:05:44,833
你根本不懂失去孩子的苦

923
01:05:44,916 --> 01:05:46,916
而且心裡明白
很快就會失去另一個孩子

924
01:06:06,375 --> 01:06:08,041
你做了什麼？

925
01:06:08,125 --> 01:06:10,500
你不會幫我報名
去跟樂團一起唱歌吧？

926
01:06:10,583 --> 01:06:11,791
我剛才在跟你爸談

927
01:06:12,541 --> 01:06:13,750
然後？

928
01:06:14,583 --> 01:06:16,166
傑米，你得解決這個問題

929
01:06:16,666 --> 01:06:20,833
安娜，我知道你的人生都計畫好了

930
01:06:21,791 --> 01:06:25,416
你不需要修補我的人生
有些東西不是努力就能修好的

931
01:06:26,125 --> 01:06:27,791
好，身為你的朋友，我想他…

932
01:06:27,875 --> 01:06:28,833
要嫑喝一杯？

933
01:06:29,500 --> 01:06:30,333
我要喝酒

934
01:06:34,041 --> 01:06:35,166
借過

935
01:06:37,625 --> 01:06:41,083
不，我以前很喜歡足球
我也踢得很好

936
01:06:41,166 --> 01:06:43,708
要不是更衣室其他人有恐同情結

937
01:06:43,791 --> 01:06:46,583
老實說，他們現在早就叫我
「娘砲版貝克漢」

938
01:06:46,666 --> 01:06:48,291
「誇張C羅」

939
01:06:48,375 --> 01:06:51,625
跟「娘砲婊子莎賓娜」了
但那跟足球無關

940
01:06:51,708 --> 01:06:54,166
你應該跟大學同志足球協會一起踢球

941
01:06:54,250 --> 01:06:55,333
他們人很好

942
01:06:55,416 --> 01:06:56,750
我很樂意

943
01:06:56,833 --> 01:07:00,875
比賽結束後
或許我們可以去吃晚餐跟看電影？

944
01:07:02,458 --> 01:07:03,291
跟我？

945
01:07:04,583 --> 01:07:05,583
不

946
01:07:05,666 --> 01:07:06,500
不，我衹是…

947
01:07:07,458 --> 01:07:09,500
我馬上回來，我衹是要…

948
01:07:13,875 --> 01:07:16,083
天啊，我從來沒這麼受辱過

949
01:07:16,166 --> 01:07:19,041
才聊了一下，他就準備要跟我結婚了

950
01:07:19,125 --> 01:07:21,750
我看起來像那種
準備要認眞談感情的人嗎？

951
01:07:22,250 --> 01:07:24,250
我根本不知道你是誰

952
01:07:25,791 --> 01:07:27,583
我自己也很迷惘

953
01:07:39,166 --> 01:07:40,416
西西莉亞，你好

954
01:07:44,708 --> 01:07:45,958
傑米跟我說…

955
01:07:49,916 --> 01:07:52,458
簡直就像在看慢動作發生的車禍

956
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,500
他很勇敢，可是那…

957
01:08:00,333 --> 01:08:01,833
完全毀了我

958
01:08:05,291 --> 01:08:06,958
而且無法釋懷

959
01:08:07,041 --> 01:08:10,791
我會出門跟路人甲調情，可是

960
01:08:12,291 --> 01:08:13,250
僅止於此

961
01:08:16,791 --> 01:08:18,875
我應該會一輩子當老處女

962
01:08:38,500 --> 01:08:41,166
-怎麼了，唐姆？
-我在想能否很快地…

963
01:08:41,250 --> 01:08:42,250
我衹是要…

964
01:08:42,333 --> 01:08:43,666
對，先跟…

965
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:48,125
我們要跳舞嗎？

966
01:08:48,625 --> 01:08:52,125
-你知道我不會跳舞，所以…
-怎麼了？我跟對方很聊得來

967
01:08:52,208 --> 01:08:54,125
是的，但僅此而已，不是嗎？

968
01:08:54,875 --> 01:08:58,666
因為你跑去跟…東尼跳舞

969
01:08:58,750 --> 01:09:01,250
可是或許你和我可以…

970
01:09:03,166 --> 01:09:04,875
我可以敎你騎單輪車

971
01:09:05,875 --> 01:09:09,500
-唐姆，你在跟我調情嗎？
-沒錯

972
01:09:15,916 --> 01:09:16,916
你有話要說嗎？

973
01:09:17,916 --> 01:09:18,916
眞的很抱歉

974
01:09:20,125 --> 01:09:21,833
-我不是有意要…
-這麼混蛋？

975
01:09:22,750 --> 01:09:23,583
沒關係

976
01:09:24,291 --> 01:09:27,166
要你們英國人談自己的感受
就像要你們的命一樣

977
01:09:27,250 --> 01:09:28,500
你想跳舞嗎？

978
01:09:31,833 --> 01:09:32,875
像那樣？

979
01:09:36,958 --> 01:09:37,791
不是

980
01:09:37,875 --> 01:09:39,958
比那更糟

981
01:10:11,208 --> 01:10:12,500
我喜歡你媽

982
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:17,541
她給我她的電話號碼
叫我打給她嗑牙

983
01:10:17,625 --> 01:10:21,666
瑪姬說那指的
不是下顎手術，而是聊天

984
01:10:22,333 --> 01:10:23,833
可以幫我解開拉鍊嗎？

985
01:10:24,708 --> 01:10:27,958
當然可以，我衹是有點…

986
01:10:31,791 --> 01:10:32,625
傑米！

987
01:10:33,125 --> 01:10:34,750
傑米！傑…

988
01:10:39,708 --> 01:10:41,083
你喜歡那些花嗎？

989
01:10:44,458 --> 01:10:45,375
是假的

990
01:10:46,250 --> 01:10:47,166
這是祕密

991
01:10:47,875 --> 01:10:49,166
往好處想

992
01:10:49,250 --> 01:10:52,416
至少我舞會結束才現出原形

993
01:10:54,333 --> 01:10:56,041
你一定要反諷嗎？

994
01:10:56,750 --> 01:10:57,625
不用

995
01:10:59,500 --> 01:11:02,333
安娜，我沒事，我衹是過度操勞

996
01:11:02,416 --> 01:11:06,375
我的狀態可能比你好一點

997
01:11:06,458 --> 01:11:10,000
或許可以請護理師偸偸給你解酒藥

998
01:11:10,083 --> 01:11:11,875
-給你，這應該會有幫助
-謝謝

999
01:11:12,875 --> 01:11:15,208
傑米，你需要效果更強烈的東西

1000
01:11:15,791 --> 01:11:16,750
威士忌？

1001
01:11:16,833 --> 01:11:20,625
我最近喝了很多巴克法斯特補酒
你聽說過嗎？

1002
01:11:20,708 --> 01:11:21,708
眞的嗎？是嗎？

1003
01:11:21,791 --> 01:11:24,458
也許加了一些麥斯卡爾酒

1004
01:11:24,541 --> 01:11:26,583
我想我喝杯拿鐵就好

1005
01:11:44,416 --> 01:11:47,375
很抱歉，史黛安敎授再次請我代課

1006
01:11:47,458 --> 01:11:50,666
來討論丁尼生的《越過沙洲》

1007
01:11:50,750 --> 01:11:55,458
這可以說是史上最偉大的生死之詩

1008
01:11:55,541 --> 01:11:59,291
他把死亡比喻成出海

1009
01:11:59,375 --> 01:12:04,958
他在死前衹想聽到輕柔的鐘聲

1010
01:12:05,041 --> 01:12:07,500
然後被黑闇吞噬

1011
01:12:07,583 --> 01:12:10,583
與其害怕死亡，他反而欣然接受

1012
01:12:10,666 --> 01:12:12,250
我認為有何不可

1013
01:12:13,208 --> 01:12:14,833
因為已經到了終點

1014
01:12:15,333 --> 01:12:18,166
你早該做的一切都結束了

1015
01:12:19,041 --> 01:12:21,458
對…但是

1016
01:12:22,333 --> 01:12:26,666
瑪姬，或許重點不是
人在世上能活多久

1017
01:12:26,750 --> 01:12:28,166
而是如何過完這一生

1018
01:12:33,208 --> 01:12:35,166
我希望能死在酒吧裡

1019
01:12:36,041 --> 01:12:39,583
不是以悲傷的方式
而是以歡樂的方式

1020
01:12:39,666 --> 01:12:42,583
不，但我…如果我在大笑
結果從椅子上摔下來

1021
01:12:42,666 --> 01:12:44,625
但不是因為我喝多了…

1022
01:12:44,708 --> 01:12:46,916
我可能喝了一、兩杯酒

1023
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:50,250
不過是有趣的酒
例如用吸管喝鳳梨可樂達之類的

1024
01:12:50,333 --> 01:12:52,416
我男友也在場，他很喜歡

1025
01:12:52,500 --> 01:12:54,166
他會溫柔地親我的臉頰

1026
01:12:54,250 --> 01:12:56,541
足以表示我們仍然喜歡彼此

1027
01:12:56,625 --> 01:12:59,250
那時我會做很多慈善工作

1028
01:12:59,333 --> 01:13:01,125
我想大家都看得出來

1029
01:13:01,208 --> 01:13:03,000
我眼中閃過一抹光芒，表示我在乎

1030
01:13:03,083 --> 01:13:06,583
所以我過世時，慈善界會損失慘重

1031
01:13:06,666 --> 01:13:07,916
人們顯然很難過

1032
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,583
牛津大學失去了一位偉人

1033
01:13:10,666 --> 01:13:13,875
但顯…不過我還是會死
因為時候到了

1034
01:13:13,958 --> 01:13:15,166
不過，對，是在酒吧裡

1035
01:13:16,541 --> 01:13:19,291
丁尼生的詩描寫的是沙洲

1036
01:13:23,416 --> 01:13:24,416
安娜

1037
01:13:24,500 --> 01:13:25,916
媽，你怎麼還沒睡？

1038
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:27,625
我剛上完夜班

1039
01:13:27,708 --> 01:13:30,208
我去加班，你知道我捨不得拒絕

1040
01:13:30,291 --> 01:13:31,625
總之，因為我還醒著

1041
01:13:31,708 --> 01:13:33,333
才有機會跟你聊聊

1042
01:13:33,416 --> 01:13:35,208
你很快就要回來了

1043
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,125
就是啊，時間過得很快

1044
01:13:38,208 --> 01:13:40,583
不對，你離開太久了

1045
01:13:41,125 --> 01:13:43,166
我見到史蒂芬德加多的母親

1046
01:13:43,250 --> 01:13:44,458
他還好嗎？

1047
01:13:44,541 --> 01:13:46,250
他已經在賺六位數的薪水了

1048
01:13:50,250 --> 01:13:53,208
安娜，我有事得跟你談

1049
01:13:54,208 --> 01:13:55,041
什麼事？

1050
01:13:55,625 --> 01:13:58,250
-你下週末要過生日
-天啊，傑米

1051
01:13:58,333 --> 01:14:02,916
選一個吧，我們要去塞納河畔喝醉？

1052
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:06,458
還是要去愛琴海游泳
還是兩者都要？

1053
01:14:08,333 --> 01:14:11,250
我們可以隨心所欲
你想去哪裡就去哪裡

1054
01:14:12,083 --> 01:14:13,541
-想去哪裡都可以？
-任何地方

1055
01:14:14,583 --> 01:14:16,208
-做什麼都可以？
-什麼都可以

1056
01:14:19,416 --> 01:14:21,625
天啊，看路！

1057
01:14:24,250 --> 01:14:28,833
天…把你那得意的笑容収起來

1058
01:14:29,708 --> 01:14:31,958
慢一點，要轉彎了

1059
01:14:32,041 --> 01:14:33,500
天啊！我的天啊！

1060
01:14:36,125 --> 01:14:39,083
安娜，這輛車我修過一次
請小心一點

1061
01:14:39,166 --> 01:14:40,791
別緊張，這太好玩了

1062
01:14:40,875 --> 01:14:42,208
拜託，專心看路

1063
01:14:42,291 --> 01:14:45,083
我覺得我就像
要去彭伯利莊園的伊莉莎白班奈特

1064
01:14:45,166 --> 01:14:47,541
光是為了通過那塊地
她就花了一個小時

1065
01:14:47,625 --> 01:14:49,625
然後突然間，他們轉了彎…

1066
01:14:50,333 --> 01:14:52,000
天啊！

1067
01:14:56,625 --> 01:14:57,708
你是在這裡長大的？

1068
01:14:58,750 --> 01:14:59,583
對

1069
01:15:00,250 --> 01:15:01,083
這裡？

1070
01:15:01,666 --> 01:15:03,375
-對
-這個地方？

1071
01:15:04,208 --> 01:15:05,083
對

1072
01:15:08,458 --> 01:15:09,333
爛透了

1073
01:15:28,125 --> 01:15:29,791
-你到了
-你好

1074
01:15:30,791 --> 01:15:33,208
安娜，每次見到你
你都變得更漂亮了

1075
01:15:33,291 --> 01:15:35,166
再這樣下去，我們就當不成朋友了

1076
01:15:36,208 --> 01:15:38,916
-你好嗎？
-她英國狂熱發作了

1077
01:15:40,041 --> 01:15:40,958
你好，親愛的

1078
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:44,083
你爸爸剛看完書

1079
01:15:45,750 --> 01:15:48,291
來，我帶你去看
伊莉莎白囚禁瑪麗的地方

1080
01:15:48,375 --> 01:15:49,500
-不會吧
-是眞的

1081
01:15:49,583 --> 01:15:50,583
-不會吧
-是眞的

1082
01:15:58,375 --> 01:16:00,166
要是他太自大

1083
01:16:00,250 --> 01:16:02,708
就提醒他七代以前的祖父

1084
01:16:02,791 --> 01:16:06,916
曾擔任廁伕
也就是幫國王擦屁股的人

1085
01:16:07,583 --> 01:16:11,625
你好，我衹是在了解
你七代以前的祖父

1086
01:16:11,708 --> 01:16:14,333
好，她講得好像是什麼壞事似的

1087
01:16:14,416 --> 01:16:17,208
但諾里斯勛爵很有權勢
國王都聽他的

1088
01:16:17,291 --> 01:16:18,541
何止是聽他的

1089
01:16:19,583 --> 01:16:22,458
來，我帶你去掛毯室
你先走，親愛的

1090
01:16:26,083 --> 01:16:28,541
驚喜

1091
01:16:29,291 --> 01:16:31,041
-你沒這麼做吧
-恐怕有

1092
01:16:32,625 --> 01:16:34,250
驚喜！

1093
01:16:34,875 --> 01:16:36,541
傑米，我不喜歡驚喜

1094
01:16:36,625 --> 01:16:40,541
是我不好
那我就取消生日活動，請大…

1095
01:16:46,208 --> 01:16:47,666
我們要嫑…

1096
01:16:49,666 --> 01:16:51,250
-對喔
-對

1097
01:16:52,625 --> 01:16:54,541
驚喜？

1098
01:16:54,625 --> 01:16:57,666
-對！
-太好了！

1099
01:16:57,750 --> 01:16:58,583
你好

1100
01:16:58,666 --> 01:16:59,958
敬安娜

1101
01:17:00,041 --> 01:17:01,458
敬安娜

1102
01:17:02,750 --> 01:17:03,708
好耶

1103
01:17:03,791 --> 01:17:06,375
-好耶
-查理，你眞的很厲害

1104
01:17:06,458 --> 01:17:08,833
我以前是槌球校隊隊長

1105
01:17:09,500 --> 01:17:11,125
我們屢戰屢敗

1106
01:17:11,208 --> 01:17:14,375
好，輪到誰？是壽星嗎？

1107
01:17:14,458 --> 01:17:15,916
沒錯

1108
01:17:16,416 --> 01:17:17,625
我沒打過

1109
01:17:17,708 --> 01:17:21,458
還好你正在嘗試
許多清單上沒做過的事

1110
01:17:21,541 --> 01:17:23,083
我已經沒有清單了

1111
01:17:23,916 --> 01:17:25,041
都完成了？

1112
01:17:25,125 --> 01:17:27,750
不，衹是…過一天算一天

1113
01:17:29,125 --> 01:17:30,125
我喜歡

1114
01:17:30,708 --> 01:17:33,166
-對，好，所以…
-衹要彎腰？

1115
01:17:33,250 --> 01:17:34,125
對

1116
01:17:34,208 --> 01:17:35,750
天啊，去開房間啦

1117
01:17:35,833 --> 01:17:38,458
我們早就有房間了
伊莉莎白女王曾睡在裡面

1118
01:17:42,750 --> 01:17:44,125
好吧，其實打槌球時

1119
01:17:44,916 --> 01:17:45,791
那一球打得很糟

1120
01:17:46,291 --> 01:17:47,791
應該是我的老師不會敎

1121
01:17:47,875 --> 01:17:50,958
眞的嗎？天啊，好
這話說得太重囉，下一位？

1122
01:17:51,958 --> 01:17:53,166
太好了

1123
01:17:57,875 --> 01:17:59,583
說眞的，一瓶夠嗎？

1124
01:18:00,416 --> 01:18:02,000
-有查理在
-沒錯

1125
01:18:02,625 --> 01:18:03,958
-我再拿一瓶
-好

1126
01:18:04,458 --> 01:18:05,416
我馬上回來

1127
01:18:10,875 --> 01:18:12,958
-抱歉，不，你先
-抱歉，你先

1128
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,958
-我要拿這瓶過去
-我們要吃的是威靈頓牛肉

1129
01:18:17,750 --> 01:18:19,291
對，這是要在外面喝的

1130
01:18:20,458 --> 01:18:23,000
傑米，可以跟你談嗎？

1131
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:24,875
一定要嗎？

1132
01:18:25,625 --> 01:18:26,458
今天？

1133
01:18:28,791 --> 01:18:29,666
好吧

1134
01:18:54,916 --> 01:18:57,166
-我去拿掃把
-別管了，路克會打掃

1135
01:18:57,250 --> 01:18:59,250
-沒必要
-我已經叫你別管了！

1136
01:19:02,833 --> 01:19:04,166
可以聽我說嗎？

1137
01:19:05,291 --> 01:19:06,291
就這一次

1138
01:19:08,708 --> 01:19:12,375
我跟帕特爾醫生談過了
他說有種新藥…

1139
01:19:12,458 --> 01:19:13,333
我嫑再吃藥了

1140
01:19:14,250 --> 01:19:17,083
-我說過了，我不治療了
-你得繼續對抗病魔！

1141
01:19:17,166 --> 01:19:18,625
天啊，你根本不懂

1142
01:19:19,916 --> 01:19:22,375
我不想在醫院裡浪費我剩下的時間

1143
01:19:22,875 --> 01:19:27,000
我想在牛津度過
和我愛的人從事我熱愛的事

1144
01:19:27,083 --> 01:19:28,375
我絕對不會接受

1145
01:19:29,250 --> 01:19:31,250
我不能坐視不管…

1146
01:19:32,666 --> 01:19:34,375
你哥哥至少努力過了

1147
01:19:35,750 --> 01:19:36,666
對

1148
01:19:38,708 --> 01:19:41,041
在你眼裡，艾德華一直都很完美

1149
01:19:41,125 --> 01:19:43,291
-我並沒有比較疼他
-你知道你說了什麼？

1150
01:19:43,958 --> 01:19:45,000
我知道你說了什麼

1151
01:19:46,750 --> 01:19:47,666
我那時身心受創

1152
01:19:49,166 --> 01:19:51,000
我承受了喪子之痛

1153
01:19:51,083 --> 01:19:52,333
他也是我哥哥！

1154
01:19:53,916 --> 01:19:54,750
詹姆斯

1155
01:19:56,083 --> 01:19:57,000
拜託你

1156
01:19:59,250 --> 01:20:01,500
我衹是想保住你的命

1157
01:20:05,375 --> 01:20:07,208
你無權決定

1158
01:20:22,625 --> 01:20:23,500
傑米？

1159
01:20:25,125 --> 01:20:25,958
傑米？

1160
01:20:46,875 --> 01:20:48,250
生日過得怎麼樣？

1161
01:20:50,041 --> 01:20:52,250
還有時間改善

1162
01:20:53,541 --> 01:20:54,416
或是惡化

1163
01:20:55,083 --> 01:20:56,250
你還眞樂觀

1164
01:20:59,041 --> 01:21:00,958
情況很糟糕，對吧？

1165
01:21:02,166 --> 01:21:03,000
是啊

1166
01:21:04,291 --> 01:21:08,500
要是某兩個人収斂一點
就不會那麼糟了

1167
01:21:08,583 --> 01:21:11,833
天啊，我同意
唐姆和瑪姬太常接吻了

1168
01:21:11,916 --> 01:21:12,916
讓人很不自在

1169
01:21:14,916 --> 01:21:18,333
你得照我的意思去做
這個月我過生日

1170
01:21:18,416 --> 01:21:19,250
月？

1171
01:21:20,791 --> 01:21:22,208
你果然是美國人

1172
01:21:23,541 --> 01:21:24,416
是啊

1173
01:21:24,500 --> 01:21:26,000
身為美國人

1174
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:28,250
我可以有話直說嗎？

1175
01:21:29,583 --> 01:21:31,958
我想你快忍不住了

1176
01:21:34,208 --> 01:21:35,250
艾迪在這裡過世的？

1177
01:21:39,625 --> 01:21:40,500
對，沒錯

1178
01:21:41,875 --> 01:21:44,666
你說艾迪在你的人生中扮演重要角色

1179
01:21:45,708 --> 01:21:47,958
為何他的回憶不能扮演同樣的角色？

1180
01:21:49,625 --> 01:21:51,166
你不懂

1181
01:21:52,708 --> 01:21:53,541
當然囉

1182
01:21:54,708 --> 01:21:55,833
我又不是本地人

1183
01:22:00,708 --> 01:22:03,500
我先進去，我有事要做

1184
01:22:25,458 --> 01:22:26,583
有什麼事嗎？

1185
01:22:27,291 --> 01:22:28,625
我帶了禮物來給你

1186
01:22:30,666 --> 01:22:31,583
謝謝

1187
01:22:32,250 --> 01:22:33,333
沒必要破費

1188
01:22:33,916 --> 01:22:34,750
不用客氣

1189
01:22:35,833 --> 01:22:36,875
晚餐見

1190
01:22:44,166 --> 01:22:46,208
（停下來思考！人生短暫）

1191
01:22:46,291 --> 01:22:49,041
（脆弱的露珠
在危險的路上，濟慈著）

1192
01:23:00,625 --> 01:23:02,750
（捷豹E型）

1193
01:23:06,041 --> 01:23:07,625
好，接下來拆我的

1194
01:23:09,208 --> 01:23:10,333
不會吧！

1195
01:23:10,416 --> 01:23:14,083
是沒什麼新意，但好鞋永遠不嫌多

1196
01:23:14,166 --> 01:23:17,875
我每次穿這雙鞋
都會想起你，我會很常穿

1197
01:23:18,500 --> 01:23:21,875
我們打算讓你非常想念我們
這樣你就非回來不可

1198
01:23:22,666 --> 01:23:23,708
你有沒有考慮過

1199
01:23:24,708 --> 01:23:25,583
嫑走？

1200
01:23:26,333 --> 01:23:28,333
唸完大學跟牛津就進高盛工作

1201
01:23:29,666 --> 01:23:31,208
我一直都是這麼打算的

1202
01:23:31,291 --> 01:23:35,875
好，王薇薇本來打算當花式溜冰選手

1203
01:23:35,958 --> 01:23:37,958
喬治亞曼尼原本是要受訓當醫生的

1204
01:23:38,041 --> 01:23:41,916
而維多利亞貝克漢原本想當歌手

1205
01:23:43,333 --> 01:23:44,208
酷喔！

1206
01:23:44,291 --> 01:23:46,041
好，剩下誰？唐姆

1207
01:23:48,666 --> 01:23:52,416
-我不知道要準備禮物
-這是生日派對，唐姆

1208
01:23:52,500 --> 01:23:54,833
對，你得為她獻唱一首歌，快點

1209
01:23:58,916 --> 01:23:59,791
好

1210
01:24:01,833 --> 01:24:04,208
安東妮雅告訴我傑米和艾迪

1211
01:24:05,416 --> 01:24:08,666
以前會偸穿爸爸的手工鞋

1212
01:24:10,750 --> 01:24:11,666
顯然…

1213
01:24:13,125 --> 01:24:15,583
威廉顯然知道他們在偸穿，但他

1214
01:24:16,083 --> 01:24:18,583
闇自引以為傲
因為他們喜歡他的風格

1215
01:24:21,625 --> 01:24:23,208
眞希望我能認識艾迪

1216
01:24:23,791 --> 01:24:25,541
艾迪一定會很喜歡你

1217
01:24:32,125 --> 01:24:33,458
你後悔過嗎？

1218
01:24:36,125 --> 01:24:37,125
西西莉亞！

1219
01:24:38,083 --> 01:24:39,666
你會彈琴嗎？我們需要幫忙

1220
01:24:39,750 --> 01:24:41,000
我會，我馬上過去

1221
01:24:48,791 --> 01:24:50,750
我絕對不會後悔

1222
01:24:54,708 --> 01:24:57,791
好，要彈什麼曲子？對喔，好

1223
01:25:12,250 --> 01:25:13,083
沒錯

1224
01:25:19,541 --> 01:25:20,375
高一點！

1225
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:33,875
失陪一下

1226
01:25:36,208 --> 01:25:37,041
安娜？

1227
01:25:40,791 --> 01:25:43,000
-好大的膽子！
-傑米？

1228
01:25:43,083 --> 01:25:43,958
威廉？

1229
01:25:44,708 --> 01:25:46,166
來啊！我眞的不…

1230
01:25:46,250 --> 01:25:47,250
什麼？不對，是那裡

1231
01:25:48,041 --> 01:25:49,166
嘿！

1232
01:25:51,583 --> 01:25:52,500
很抱歉

1233
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:54,958
我錯過你拆禮物的時間，我們…

1234
01:25:55,041 --> 01:25:56,000
我們衹是…

1235
01:25:56,541 --> 01:25:57,583
我們談了一下

1236
01:25:57,666 --> 01:25:59,291
-結果開始喝酒
-對

1237
01:25:59,958 --> 01:26:01,208
然後我們拚完了

1238
01:26:01,291 --> 01:26:02,875
沒錯，你們看

1239
01:26:06,958 --> 01:26:08,375
那車輪呢？

1240
01:26:09,750 --> 01:26:11,500
-車輪在哪裡？
-我想…

1241
01:26:12,125 --> 01:26:14,375
我想應該是你負責的吧

1242
01:26:15,666 --> 01:26:16,916
可以，對

1243
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:18,916
我超愛臺北！

1244
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:19,875
不對

1245
01:26:21,708 --> 01:26:22,708
-不會吧！
-對

1246
01:26:22,791 --> 01:26:24,166
我才不相信

1247
01:26:26,125 --> 01:26:29,541
我想舉杯敬酒

1248
01:26:30,125 --> 01:26:31,041
敬安娜

1249
01:26:32,041 --> 01:26:33,125
生日快樂

1250
01:26:33,708 --> 01:26:38,958
謝謝你結合了濟慈、汽車和艾迪

1251
01:26:39,625 --> 01:26:41,500
成就了今晚

1252
01:26:41,583 --> 01:26:42,541
乾杯！

1253
01:26:43,333 --> 01:26:45,250
-乾杯！
-乾杯！

1254
01:26:46,583 --> 01:26:47,791
還有

1255
01:26:49,416 --> 01:26:50,291
敬傑米

1256
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:54,291
我的…兒子

1257
01:26:55,500 --> 01:26:56,666
我的寶貝

1258
01:26:58,333 --> 01:26:59,250
我畢生的

1259
01:27:00,083 --> 01:27:01,208
摯愛

1260
01:27:04,958 --> 01:27:05,791
我…

1261
01:27:07,333 --> 01:27:09,166
我會…我想要…

1262
01:27:11,541 --> 01:27:12,375
我…

1263
01:27:15,833 --> 01:27:16,708
很抱歉

1264
01:27:23,458 --> 01:27:26,500
-沒錯，敬傑米
-敬傑米

1265
01:27:26,583 --> 01:27:30,083
乾杯，現在我想扮演安娜的監護人

1266
01:27:30,708 --> 01:27:33,125
並問問你，達文波特少爺

1267
01:27:33,208 --> 01:27:36,125
先生，你打算拿她怎麼辦？

1268
01:27:37,916 --> 01:27:40,041
因為老實說，你四處留情

1269
01:27:40,666 --> 01:27:44,250
抱歉，不，對不起
希望你媽知道這一點

1270
01:27:44,333 --> 01:27:46,166
-我當然知道
-沒錯

1271
01:27:46,250 --> 01:27:48,375
說眞的，上床次數
比焰火節的煙火還多

1272
01:27:48,458 --> 01:27:51,583
不急著去趕公車的
他都會上，有時趕公車的也會

1273
01:27:51,666 --> 01:27:55,166
但你似乎已經定下來了

1274
01:27:55,250 --> 01:27:58,208
不過我希望你保證

1275
01:27:58,291 --> 01:28:00,208
安娜六個月後

1276
01:28:01,291 --> 01:28:02,666
不會孤單一個人

1277
01:28:25,875 --> 01:28:27,416
抱歉，有什麼好笑的？

1278
01:28:28,166 --> 01:28:30,083
查理，很抱歉讓你失望了

1279
01:28:30,166 --> 01:28:34,041
不過非常確定的一件事

1280
01:28:34,125 --> 01:28:37,458
就是我會離開安娜

1281
01:28:43,291 --> 01:28:46,708
我醫學院還有一年才畢業
我會繼續為你做研究

1282
01:28:46,791 --> 01:28:49,708
治愈疑難雜癥不可能那麼難

1283
01:28:49,791 --> 01:28:53,166
對我來說可能來不及了
唐姆，不過很感激你這麼有心

1284
01:28:53,250 --> 01:28:55,291
接下來要去哪裡狂歡？

1285
01:28:55,375 --> 01:28:56,750
我們要帶你上床睡覺了

1286
01:28:56,833 --> 01:28:59,458
你們就衹想要上床
從現在起，我可不配合

1287
01:28:59,541 --> 01:29:01,083
因為我應該得到更好的對待

1288
01:29:01,166 --> 01:29:02,583
-走吧
-不可思議

1289
01:29:04,083 --> 01:29:05,791
-睡得安穩，西西
-晚安，親愛的

1290
01:29:06,500 --> 01:29:07,958
-早上見
-早上見

1291
01:29:10,416 --> 01:29:13,208
爸跟我可能會再試著把車組裝好

1292
01:29:13,916 --> 01:29:15,166
可以嗎？

1293
01:29:15,833 --> 01:29:16,916
不行

1294
01:29:17,750 --> 01:29:18,666
不行？

1295
01:29:28,708 --> 01:29:29,875
謝謝

1296
01:29:30,625 --> 01:29:31,833
我也愛你

1297
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:47,500
-剛才講到哪裡？
-對，你，快組裝車

1298
01:29:47,583 --> 01:29:48,875
嫑再胡鬧了

1299
01:29:48,958 --> 01:29:51,000
-嫑再胡鬧了
-都是因為你…

1300
01:30:13,083 --> 01:30:15,250
生日快樂，安娜！

1301
01:30:17,666 --> 01:30:20,333
你兩週後就要回來了，親愛的

1302
01:30:20,833 --> 01:30:21,666
是啊

1303
01:30:23,541 --> 01:30:24,458
怎麼了？

1304
01:30:25,875 --> 01:30:26,708
好

1305
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:33,833
好

1306
01:30:34,666 --> 01:30:35,541
他走了

1307
01:30:36,291 --> 01:30:37,416
快說吧

1308
01:30:38,375 --> 01:30:40,666
不曉得耶，媽，我…

1309
01:30:42,416 --> 01:30:44,166
我甚至不知道該怎麼…

1310
01:30:45,291 --> 01:30:46,291
我衹是…我…

1311
01:30:48,500 --> 01:30:51,583
我現在想要的東西跟以前不一樣了

1312
01:30:53,291 --> 01:30:57,916
我知道我不能做錯誤的選擇，但…

1313
01:31:02,125 --> 01:31:03,416
我要待在這裡

1314
01:31:03,500 --> 01:31:04,375
什麼？

1315
01:31:05,166 --> 01:31:08,750
什麼？不行！為什麼？
不行，安娜，不可以

1316
01:31:08,833 --> 01:31:10,916
你為什麼要放棄自己的未來？

1317
01:31:12,375 --> 01:31:14,125
不行！

1318
01:31:20,416 --> 01:31:21,833
我就知道會這樣

1319
01:31:23,416 --> 01:31:25,500
-你知道？
-對，那當然！

1320
01:31:25,583 --> 01:31:27,875
因為你很愛作夢，安娜

1321
01:31:27,958 --> 01:31:29,583
抱歉，媽，我衹是…

1322
01:31:31,083 --> 01:31:32,291
我不能離開

1323
01:31:45,041 --> 01:31:47,125
做出選擇之前

1324
01:31:48,250 --> 01:31:50,625
永遠都不知道這選擇是對是錯

1325
01:31:51,625 --> 01:31:53,375
即使如此…

1326
01:31:56,291 --> 01:31:57,791
但重要的是

1327
01:31:58,583 --> 01:31:59,583
得由你

1328
01:32:00,500 --> 01:32:01,333
自己選擇

1329
01:32:04,958 --> 01:32:06,583
我不想讓你失望

1330
01:32:08,625 --> 01:32:09,458
安娜

1331
01:32:10,791 --> 01:32:13,166
我總是說你的潛力無可限量

1332
01:32:13,958 --> 01:32:18,583
我的意思不衹是你無所不能

1333
01:32:19,916 --> 01:32:22,291
我指的也是我們會支持你

1334
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:24,791
不管你怎麼選擇

1335
01:32:29,541 --> 01:32:31,750
雖然不完美，但我們…

1336
01:32:34,041 --> 01:32:35,291
謝謝，媽

1337
01:32:37,041 --> 01:32:38,541
我明天會通知他們

1338
01:32:39,333 --> 01:32:40,791
我要婉拒這份工作

1339
01:32:43,041 --> 01:32:44,041
我愛你

1340
01:32:45,625 --> 01:32:46,458
再見

1341
01:32:47,291 --> 01:32:48,458
你不能留下來

1342
01:32:49,750 --> 01:32:50,916
-傑米
-不，安娜

1343
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:53,458
你跟西西莉亞談過了嗎？
你在這裡不會有未來

1344
01:32:53,541 --> 01:32:56,708
不管在哪裡
都不保證會有未來，但這裡有你

1345
01:32:56,791 --> 01:32:58,666
我們說好了，對吧？

1346
01:32:58,750 --> 01:33:00,250
對，我知道

1347
01:33:00,333 --> 01:33:01,375
玩玩而已，可是

1348
01:33:02,125 --> 01:33:03,916
我們已經動了眞感情，不是嗎？

1349
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:06,166
你不能留下來，安娜，我不會允許的

1350
01:33:06,791 --> 01:33:09,875
-這太荒謬了
-少批評我

1351
01:33:10,583 --> 01:33:14,333
天啊，你好像以為
你可以把我塑造成你想要的樣子

1352
01:33:14,416 --> 01:33:16,708
-但我不是這樣的人，傑米
-我知道你不是

1353
01:33:16,791 --> 01:33:20,375
因為是的話
我絕不會讓你做這麼愚蠢的決定

1354
01:33:24,750 --> 01:33:25,875
你要做什麼？

1355
01:33:26,916 --> 01:33:28,333
你要去哪裡？

1356
01:33:30,375 --> 01:33:34,083
這間屋子的房間那麼多
我可以去找其他地方過夜

1357
01:34:04,041 --> 01:34:06,208
再見，對，那當然

1358
01:34:09,291 --> 01:34:11,000
祝你回到美國一切順利

1359
01:35:29,333 --> 01:35:30,583
好，笑得開心點

1360
01:35:33,333 --> 01:35:34,416
我在錄影，三位

1361
01:35:34,500 --> 01:35:36,541
-好丟臉
-不會，這樣很好

1362
01:35:36,625 --> 01:35:37,750
西西莉亞呢？

1363
01:35:40,916 --> 01:35:41,916
對

1364
01:35:44,916 --> 01:35:46,500
我今晚有約會了

1365
01:35:52,208 --> 01:35:53,916
你可以跟我和唐姆兩對一起約會

1366
01:35:58,208 --> 01:35:59,791
-我很樂意
-太好了

1367
01:35:59,875 --> 01:36:02,083
安娜，今晚要嫑三對一起約會？

1368
01:36:02,166 --> 01:36:04,666
先不用

1369
01:36:05,250 --> 01:36:06,833
你跟他還在冷戰？

1370
01:36:07,791 --> 01:36:11,500
太荒謬了，發生這麼多事
你不能就這麼回紐約

1371
01:36:12,083 --> 01:36:14,208
他說得很清楚，他不希望我留下來

1372
01:36:14,291 --> 01:36:17,625
他愛你，他根本不知道自己在說什麼

1373
01:36:18,333 --> 01:36:21,083
「光影各半，讓我的靈魂沉睡」

1374
01:36:21,166 --> 01:36:23,500
「不懂得哭泣的人
從未學會如何去愛」

1375
01:36:27,750 --> 01:36:28,625
丁尼生的詩

1376
01:36:29,250 --> 01:36:32,375
我上課有在聽好嗎？
這裡的學位沒那麼好拿

1377
01:36:33,375 --> 01:36:37,000
好，該開始喝酒了
誰要喝皮姆一號？皮姆一號？

1378
01:36:37,083 --> 01:36:39,916
抱歉，不能去
我要去看牛津聯的比賽

1379
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:41,208
足球賽？

1380
01:36:41,291 --> 01:36:43,416
這是約會，各位回頭見

1381
01:36:46,291 --> 01:36:47,958
騎單輪車去酒吧？

1382
01:36:48,041 --> 01:36:50,041
不，走吧，唐姆，快點，安娜

1383
01:36:51,333 --> 01:36:52,166
好耶！

1384
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:03,083
你好

1385
01:37:03,166 --> 01:37:04,791
-你好，蘿拉
-抱歉

1386
01:37:05,458 --> 01:37:08,125
有個學生請我
幫他們準備這本書，可以嗎？

1387
01:37:08,208 --> 01:37:09,041
好，當然可以

1388
01:37:16,500 --> 01:37:19,083
（《湖濱散記》）

1389
01:37:36,583 --> 01:37:38,333
現在讀起來有不一樣的領會了

1390
01:37:41,625 --> 01:37:43,083
我發現

1391
01:37:44,458 --> 01:37:45,666
我一直以來都錯了

1392
01:37:47,666 --> 01:37:51,458
我們出去的第一晚
你很客氣地試著告訴我

1393
01:37:52,666 --> 01:37:56,583
梭羅所謂「從容不迫地生活」

1394
01:37:57,583 --> 01:37:59,791
指的不是計畫好一切，而是…

1395
01:38:00,708 --> 01:38:04,250
而是每分每秒都不能白過

1396
01:38:06,375 --> 01:38:09,416
因為我們的人生不過是一連串的瞬間

1397
01:38:11,958 --> 01:38:14,041
而我想跟你共度每一刻

1398
01:38:16,500 --> 01:38:18,041
不管我們還剩多少時間

1399
01:38:22,583 --> 01:38:25,125
梭羅寫那本書時精神崩潰

1400
01:38:25,708 --> 01:38:27,208
我知道，沒錯

1401
01:38:34,500 --> 01:38:36,333
安娜，我很想跟你在一起

1402
01:38:37,125 --> 01:38:38,333
但這實在太瘋狂了

1403
01:38:41,333 --> 01:38:42,250
我…

1404
01:38:42,833 --> 01:38:44,333
我怕你會後悔

1405
01:38:45,416 --> 01:38:49,291
我認為人不該為做過的事後悔

1406
01:38:50,625 --> 01:38:53,291
衹應該為沒做的事後悔

1407
01:38:58,041 --> 01:39:00,166
-你要我唱歌嗎？
-那當然

1408
01:39:00,791 --> 01:39:02,458
你還欠我那首席琳狄翁的歌

1409
01:39:02,541 --> 01:39:03,375
對

1410
01:40:33,083 --> 01:40:33,958
傑米

1411
01:40:36,208 --> 01:40:37,041
傑米？

1412
01:40:37,666 --> 01:40:38,500
傑米！

1413
01:40:40,083 --> 01:40:40,916
傑米！

1414
01:40:41,416 --> 01:40:42,416
傑米！

1415
01:40:42,500 --> 01:40:43,416
傑米？

1416
01:40:44,041 --> 01:40:44,958
傑米！

1417
01:40:50,208 --> 01:40:51,166
該死

1418
01:40:51,875 --> 01:40:52,708
天啊

1419
01:40:53,958 --> 01:40:59,041
我在這裡…

1420
01:41:08,791 --> 01:41:10,500
你們終於來了！

1421
01:41:13,666 --> 01:41:15,250
抱歉，我不該…

1422
01:41:16,583 --> 01:41:17,416
他還好嗎？

1423
01:41:18,125 --> 01:41:19,916
不是我們想要的結果

1424
01:41:23,416 --> 01:41:25,750
他正在對抗嚴重的肺炎

1425
01:41:26,750 --> 01:41:29,750
癌癥已經嚴重削弱他的免疫系統

1426
01:41:30,833 --> 01:41:34,875
現在該討論接下來的治療了

1427
01:41:40,250 --> 01:41:42,500
不行，那得由傑米來決定

1428
01:41:43,500 --> 01:41:46,166
我想他比較想要順其自然

1429
01:41:46,250 --> 01:41:48,958
我們應該尊重這一點

1430
01:41:55,208 --> 01:41:56,250
謝謝

1431
01:42:55,875 --> 01:42:58,916
既然你留下來了
你就有時間去環遊歐洲了

1432
01:43:03,833 --> 01:43:05,166
我們應該一起去

1433
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:12,166
第一站

1434
01:43:13,583 --> 01:43:14,458
阿姆斯特丹

1435
01:43:16,333 --> 01:43:18,666
在紅燈區的中心

1436
01:43:19,333 --> 01:43:20,833
我不喜歡那種地方

1437
01:43:23,916 --> 01:43:25,500
有一座敎堂

1438
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:29,416
有道闇門通往聖殿

1439
01:43:30,833 --> 01:43:32,166
眞的很美

1440
01:43:33,458 --> 01:43:35,083
令人屏息

1441
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:43,750
（八點，鬧鐘）

1442
01:43:43,833 --> 01:43:45,208
（當下構成永恆，艾蜜莉狄金生）

1443
01:43:53,916 --> 01:43:55,166
然後去巴黎

1444
01:43:58,750 --> 01:44:00,500
我們會在塞納河畔喝醉

1445
01:44:17,958 --> 01:44:19,291
很美吧？

1446
01:44:24,833 --> 01:44:26,041
還有威尼斯

1447
01:44:35,750 --> 01:44:38,041
在貢多拉上過夜

1448
01:44:45,583 --> 01:44:46,458
謝謝

1449
01:44:48,125 --> 01:44:50,500
然後我們會去海神廟

1450
01:44:51,833 --> 01:44:53,750
在高聳的海角上

1451
01:44:57,583 --> 01:44:59,541
在愛琴海游泳

1452
01:45:15,583 --> 01:45:17,416
我們會從容不迫地生活

1453
01:45:19,916 --> 01:45:22,541
吸取所有生命的精髓

1454
01:45:30,833 --> 01:45:32,750
不管有多少挫折與動盪

1455
01:46:56,375 --> 01:46:58,000
詩可以用敎的

1456
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:00,916
但其實應該用生命去體會

1457
01:47:01,500 --> 01:47:04,833
親身體驗、嘗試與參與

1458
01:47:06,041 --> 01:47:07,791
讓詩進入你的生命

1459
01:47:08,583 --> 01:47:10,291
並改變你的人生

1460
01:47:12,791 --> 01:47:15,208
因為這是我第一堂課…

1461
01:47:20,083 --> 01:47:22,583
我想先収買各位
