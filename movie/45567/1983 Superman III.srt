1
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:22,458
Name.

2
00:00:22,769 --> 00:00:24,394
Gus Gorman.

3
00:00:32,244 --> 00:00:34,576
Ah, yes. August Gorman.

4
00:00:34,779 --> 00:00:37,009
Have you looked for work this week?

5
00:00:37,248 --> 00:00:39,944
- Yes.
- What kind?

6
00:00:42,188 --> 00:00:45,122
- Kitchen technician.
- Dishwasher. Any luck?

7
00:00:45,957 --> 00:00:46,924
No, but...

8
00:00:47,124 --> 00:00:50,855
According to our records,
you have been unemployed for 36 weeks.

9
00:00:51,062 --> 00:00:52,189
No, it's 35.

10
00:00:52,396 --> 00:00:54,295
Not counting this week.

11
00:00:54,497 --> 00:00:58,865
You secured employment in June as a
messenger and were discharged after...

12
00:00:59,068 --> 00:01:01,834
...one day for...
- No, they said I lost it.

13
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:05,133
I did not lose it!
It was stolen by a pickpocket.

14
00:01:05,341 --> 00:01:06,708
A television set?

15
00:01:06,944 --> 00:01:10,573
It was a teeny tiny, teeny weensy
Japanese television set.

16
00:01:10,815 --> 00:01:15,717
The other employment you found was
in a fast-food joint, which lasted...

17
00:01:15,919 --> 00:01:17,249
...28 minutes?

18
00:01:17,821 --> 00:01:20,153
That's some kind of record.
Talk about fast.

19
00:01:20,357 --> 00:01:24,850
Those people are crazy. They expect
you to learn that stuff in one day.

20
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:29,019
"Hold the lettuce. Hold the ketchup.
Can I have some sauce, please?"

21
00:01:29,231 --> 00:01:31,756
- Mr. Gorman...
- "Two buns. No buns. Some cheese."

22
00:01:32,167 --> 00:01:35,466
Mr. Gorman, the city of Metropolis
is generous to a fault but...

23
00:01:35,871 --> 00:01:38,965
- I'm not the fault!
- 36 weeks of chronic unemployment.

24
00:01:39,175 --> 00:01:42,267
36 weeks of living off the taxes
of hard-working citizens.

25
00:01:42,478 --> 00:01:45,743
- You know what you are?
- Don't call me a bum, I'm not a bum!

26
00:01:46,715 --> 00:01:51,583
You are, I was about to say,
no longer eligible.

27
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:53,621
- Well, look...
- Next.

28
00:01:53,823 --> 00:01:55,914
What about this week?
I need this week!

29
00:01:56,424 --> 00:01:57,357
Next.

30
00:01:57,726 --> 00:01:59,317
You mean, that's it?

31
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:01,525
"Finished," like "over"?

32
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,526
Next.

33
00:02:07,267 --> 00:02:08,998
"Next" as in "bye."

34
00:02:09,772 --> 00:02:10,998
Next!

35
00:02:14,041 --> 00:02:15,099
Name.

36
00:02:16,844 --> 00:02:18,811
Excuse me, brother,
can I have a light?

37
00:02:49,475 --> 00:02:51,741
- How you doing, Alex?
- Hi, Jimmy.

38
00:04:49,524 --> 00:04:50,683
Excuse me.

39
00:06:05,964 --> 00:06:07,363
Say thank you.

40
00:06:26,417 --> 00:06:28,715
Way to go, Superman!

41
00:07:44,493 --> 00:07:46,619
<i>Your drink is on its way.</i>

42
00:07:47,628 --> 00:07:49,322
Sir.

43
00:07:49,529 --> 00:07:51,054
Excuse me...

44
00:07:53,066 --> 00:07:57,765
...but what if you want to program two
bilateral coordinates at once?

45
00:07:57,971 --> 00:07:59,997
You can't do that. It's impossible.

46
00:08:00,207 --> 00:08:01,901
- But if you can't...
- Oh, no.

47
00:08:02,108 --> 00:08:06,137
Computer technology is very advanced,
young lady, but it can't do that.

48
00:08:06,347 --> 00:08:09,315
But if you think we can't
do it that way...

49
00:08:16,322 --> 00:08:17,654
Good Lord.

50
00:08:18,258 --> 00:08:19,690
How did you do that?

51
00:08:19,893 --> 00:08:23,453
I don't know. I just did it.

52
00:08:42,481 --> 00:08:44,972
- Who's this?
- That's him, Ross Webster.

53
00:08:45,184 --> 00:08:48,176
They presented him with
the Humanitarian of the Year award.

54
00:08:48,387 --> 00:08:50,116
He is good-looking.

55
00:08:50,322 --> 00:08:52,256
Because I gave him f.2 at a 50th.

56
00:08:52,458 --> 00:08:54,220
One thing I don't understand...

57
00:08:54,427 --> 00:08:58,761
...the point of the story Lois wrote
is how Ross got this great honor...

58
00:08:58,964 --> 00:09:02,524
...and you bring me one picture of him
and 15 pictures of her.

59
00:09:02,734 --> 00:09:05,362
- Who is she?
- Lorelei Ambrosia. She's Webster's...

60
00:09:05,570 --> 00:09:08,233
She's just Webster's.
Let's leave it at that.

61
00:09:08,441 --> 00:09:11,067
- Who's this other woman?
- His sister, Vera Webster.

62
00:09:11,276 --> 00:09:12,573
- Picture looks fuzzy.
- What?

63
00:09:12,777 --> 00:09:16,508
The picture's fine, Chief.
She looks like that in real life.

64
00:09:17,114 --> 00:09:20,948
- She's VP of WEBSCOE Industries.
- I really don't understand you.

65
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:24,415
A boring banquet and you bring me
3,000 boring pictures.

66
00:09:24,654 --> 00:09:27,715
Yet Superman saves a man from
drowning on Third Avenue...

67
00:09:27,925 --> 00:09:30,758
...while you just stand there and
you don't bring me one picture!

68
00:09:30,994 --> 00:09:32,985
Chief, I didn't have
my camera with me.

69
00:09:33,197 --> 00:09:37,566
A photographer eats with his camera.
A photographer sleeps with his camera.

70
00:09:37,769 --> 00:09:40,202
- I'm glad I'm a writer.
- Mr. White, please.

71
00:09:40,404 --> 00:09:43,565
It's time for you to draw this month's
winning JINGO number.

72
00:09:43,773 --> 00:09:46,470
Prize is an all-expenses trip
to South America.

73
00:09:46,676 --> 00:09:49,304
- Why the idiot in circulation...
- Good morning.

74
00:09:49,512 --> 00:09:51,538
- Hi, Clark.
- Hi, Lois. Morning, Jimmy.

75
00:09:51,748 --> 00:09:53,510
You've got mustard on your lapel.

76
00:09:53,716 --> 00:09:55,707
Mr. White, I hate to interrupt...

77
00:09:55,918 --> 00:09:58,182
I'm busy.
I got a paper to get out here.

78
00:09:58,387 --> 00:10:00,412
It'll never replace
the printing press.

79
00:10:00,623 --> 00:10:03,615
- What's the number, Mr. White?
- 53.

80
00:10:05,094 --> 00:10:07,823
- Mr. White...
- 53!

81
00:10:08,064 --> 00:10:11,465
- Mr. White...
- You need to pull three more numbers.

82
00:10:11,667 --> 00:10:14,397
I promised I'd call them back today.
What do you think?

83
00:10:14,937 --> 00:10:18,598
- Well, I don't know, Kent...
- I think it'd make a terrific story.

84
00:10:19,842 --> 00:10:21,434
What's a terrific story?

85
00:10:21,643 --> 00:10:24,010
Kent's been invited
to his high school reunion.

86
00:10:24,447 --> 00:10:26,004
- Say.
- Yeah.

87
00:10:26,214 --> 00:10:28,012
Could we have the next number?

88
00:10:28,216 --> 00:10:30,650
It's practically an American ritual.
Right, Jimmy?

89
00:10:30,853 --> 00:10:34,754
I don't know. Most of the people
I know are still in high school.

90
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:39,324
33.

91
00:10:39,528 --> 00:10:42,291
What I thought this story
would be about...

92
00:10:42,497 --> 00:10:44,123
33.

93
00:10:44,665 --> 00:10:48,191
- Is how the typical small town's
changed in the last 15 years.

94
00:10:48,401 --> 00:10:49,529
Take me, for example:

95
00:10:49,738 --> 00:10:53,435
Can I go back to middle America
now as a Metropolis sophisticate?

96
00:10:53,642 --> 00:10:56,576
I'm really excited about this.
I was looking around...

97
00:10:56,777 --> 00:10:59,244
...in my closet last night...

98
00:10:59,445 --> 00:11:03,280
...and even found
my old high school sweater.

99
00:11:05,585 --> 00:11:07,678
- Smallville.
- Mr. White.

100
00:11:08,355 --> 00:11:10,378
Can I go ahead and
make my travel plan?

101
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:12,023
Same question about mine.

102
00:11:12,927 --> 00:11:16,692
Tell your people the prodigal son and
his photographer are coming home.

103
00:11:16,896 --> 00:11:18,727
Oh, gee, thanks, Mr. White.

104
00:11:20,599 --> 00:11:23,865
It isn't easy for me to lose
one of my best reporters.

105
00:11:24,070 --> 00:11:26,436
- That's okay.
- You deserve the vacation, Lois.

106
00:11:26,639 --> 00:11:27,867
Thank you.

107
00:11:30,542 --> 00:11:31,975
Lois, are you going someplace?

108
00:11:33,245 --> 00:11:36,841
Clark, you know some people get to go
all the way to Smallville...

109
00:11:37,049 --> 00:11:40,816
...and then there are others of us
who have to go to Bermuda.

110
00:11:41,253 --> 00:11:42,083
Golly.

111
00:11:42,922 --> 00:11:43,888
Bye.

112
00:11:45,757 --> 00:11:49,715
- Have fun.
- Mr. White, the next number, please.

113
00:11:49,927 --> 00:11:52,862
Well, I guess I better be going too.

114
00:11:54,833 --> 00:11:56,493
So I'll be going.

115
00:11:59,637 --> 00:12:00,626
Bye.

116
00:12:03,374 --> 00:12:05,536
Could we get a computer to do this?

117
00:12:28,898 --> 00:12:30,526
Hey, what is this?

118
00:12:30,735 --> 00:12:31,565
First paycheck.

119
00:12:32,034 --> 00:12:36,267
This is the first rip-off, man!
Supposed to get 225 a week, right?

120
00:12:36,473 --> 00:12:39,704
This says, "$143.80."
How am I supposed to live on that?

121
00:12:39,909 --> 00:12:43,309
State tax, federal tax,
social security tax...

122
00:12:43,513 --> 00:12:46,038
So you still get some money
when you hit 65.

123
00:12:46,249 --> 00:12:48,444
So I'm getting money when I... 65?

124
00:12:48,685 --> 00:12:49,947
I want mine now!

125
00:12:50,153 --> 00:12:54,646
I want to enjoy it while I'm young.
Get up and get down. Boogie.

126
00:12:56,158 --> 00:13:00,925
Actually, it's probably more like
$143.80 and one half cent.

127
00:13:01,129 --> 00:13:05,499
There are always fractions left over,
but big corporations round it down.

128
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:08,396
What do I do with half a cent?
Buy a thoroughbred mouse?

129
00:13:08,636 --> 00:13:10,502
Everybody loses those fractions?

130
00:13:10,706 --> 00:13:13,470
They don't lose them.
Can't lose what you never got.

131
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:15,870
Then what happens?
The company gets them?

132
00:13:16,077 --> 00:13:20,707
They can't be bothered collecting that
from your paycheck any more than you.

133
00:13:20,948 --> 00:13:22,348
Then what happens to them?

134
00:13:22,584 --> 00:13:27,044
Well, they're just floating around
out there. The computers know where.

135
00:13:27,255 --> 00:13:28,746
How many sugars?

136
00:13:29,458 --> 00:13:30,821
One and a half.

137
00:13:38,199 --> 00:13:39,826
It's quitting time. You coming?

138
00:13:40,034 --> 00:13:44,766
Yeah. No, actually I got some
stuff to finish up so...

139
00:13:45,005 --> 00:13:49,807
Working overtime, huh? What are you
doing, buddy? Looking for a raise?

140
00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:53,045
Yeah, looking for a raise.

141
00:14:30,483 --> 00:14:31,508
You bet.

142
00:14:37,655 --> 00:14:41,353
But my Uncle Al on my father's side,
he won't eat her stuffing.

143
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:46,223
He says it should be on the outside
of the turkey but she puts it inside.

144
00:14:46,431 --> 00:14:50,595
Aunt Helen's my father's half sister.
I told you that, right?

145
00:14:50,802 --> 00:14:51,927
Yeah.

146
00:14:52,136 --> 00:14:53,764
- And anyway...
- Hey, hey.

147
00:14:54,172 --> 00:14:56,106
- Look at that.
- Wow!

148
00:15:06,917 --> 00:15:11,285
Okay, your choice:
Turn back or pull over till it's over.

149
00:15:11,487 --> 00:15:13,889
- How long?
- Can't tell with these fires.

150
00:15:14,091 --> 00:15:17,255
I mean, that fire...
That's spreading like wildfire.

151
00:15:17,462 --> 00:15:18,928
It's just a building burning.

152
00:15:19,129 --> 00:15:21,427
It's not just a building.
It's a chemical plant.

153
00:15:21,931 --> 00:15:25,197
You know what I mean.
It's like... It's like chemicals.

154
00:15:25,401 --> 00:15:30,032
If that stuff goes up in smoke,
it'll be a hairy time around here.

155
00:15:32,109 --> 00:15:32,939
- Clark.
- Yeah.

156
00:15:33,142 --> 00:15:35,474
I want you to keep them distracted.

157
00:15:35,678 --> 00:15:36,771
What are you doing?

158
00:15:36,979 --> 00:15:40,039
What am I doing?
Remember what the chief said?

159
00:15:40,249 --> 00:15:42,444
Photographer always
goes after a story.

160
00:15:42,652 --> 00:15:44,176
That could be dangerous.

161
00:15:44,387 --> 00:15:48,447
Danger goes with the territory,
Mr. Kent.

162
00:16:24,992 --> 00:16:26,516
Help me!

163
00:16:27,027 --> 00:16:28,221
Help me!

164
00:16:32,132 --> 00:16:34,463
- How can I help?
- Get this man a helmet.

165
00:16:34,668 --> 00:16:36,864
- Oh, it's you.
- How bad is it?

166
00:16:37,072 --> 00:16:41,441
It's a nightmare. Everything's either
explosive or flammable or worse.

167
00:16:45,645 --> 00:16:47,705
- Get the ladder truck.
- It won't reach.

168
00:16:47,915 --> 00:16:50,109
My God, they're trapped!

169
00:16:50,851 --> 00:16:53,682
What's he gonna do?
Fly them down one at a time?

170
00:17:11,870 --> 00:17:14,066
Let's go! Everybody, down there!
Move it!

171
00:17:14,274 --> 00:17:15,832
Come on! Hurry up!

172
00:17:16,042 --> 00:17:17,133
There you go.

173
00:17:21,047 --> 00:17:22,912
Right down there. Take it easy.

174
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:26,982
All right. Everybody down there!

175
00:18:03,587 --> 00:18:05,747
Get out.
I'll show you the quickest way.

176
00:18:05,956 --> 00:18:08,050
Look after the others.
I can't leave here.

177
00:18:08,292 --> 00:18:10,486
- Why not?
- I have to look after those.

178
00:18:10,694 --> 00:18:12,253
That's concentrated Beltric acid.

179
00:18:12,463 --> 00:18:15,522
If it heats up over 180 degrees,
we've got a crisis...

180
00:18:15,732 --> 00:18:18,064
...that'll make this fire
seem like a picnic.

181
00:18:18,269 --> 00:18:19,326
What does it do?

182
00:18:19,569 --> 00:18:22,367
As long as it remains stable,
it's just ordinary acid.

183
00:18:22,773 --> 00:18:26,037
But if it begins to heat up,
it'll turn volatile.

184
00:18:26,242 --> 00:18:29,473
You'll get a great cloud of smoke
that'll eat through anything.

185
00:18:29,678 --> 00:18:32,239
Steel, concrete, anything.

186
00:18:43,691 --> 00:18:44,886
Who the hell is that?

187
00:18:45,094 --> 00:18:49,895
- Hey, you! Get off of there!
- Just gonna get a couple more shots.

188
00:19:06,148 --> 00:19:09,480
Tell them to bring their hoses
back here! Quickly!

189
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:13,578
Help!

190
00:19:14,422 --> 00:19:15,650
Help!

191
00:19:15,957 --> 00:19:16,924
Help me!

192
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:22,251
Help! Somebody help me!

193
00:19:23,231 --> 00:19:24,823
- Help!
- It's all right.

194
00:19:25,065 --> 00:19:27,694
- Superman! My leg.
- I got you. Take it easy.

195
00:19:27,902 --> 00:19:29,597
We'll go nice and easy.

196
00:19:29,804 --> 00:19:33,603
Okay, I'm sorry.
All right? Here we go.

197
00:19:37,144 --> 00:19:39,704
Medics! Over here, please.

198
00:19:40,281 --> 00:19:42,441
That's it. Here you go.

199
00:19:42,649 --> 00:19:44,208
Go easy. It's the left leg.

200
00:19:45,619 --> 00:19:46,984
- Camera.
- Yeah.

201
00:19:48,454 --> 00:19:50,514
It's a clean break across the fibula.

202
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:54,617
- My camera.
- Sorry, Jimmy. You'll be okay.

203
00:19:56,128 --> 00:20:00,690
Get the fire out! Or there'll be
a cloud of acid all over the East.

204
00:20:04,637 --> 00:20:07,197
- Christ, the pump house is gone!
- What?

205
00:20:07,405 --> 00:20:09,897
- The pump house!
- We've lost the water pressure!

206
00:20:11,576 --> 00:20:13,409
- We've got to have water!
- How?

207
00:20:13,613 --> 00:20:16,479
Lake Comooga's five miles away!
We'd need a five-mile hose!

208
00:20:16,682 --> 00:20:18,740
- Where's this lake?
- That way.

209
00:20:27,459 --> 00:20:31,088
- Tell them it's hopeless.
- We had an adequate water supply.

210
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:33,319
Water!

211
00:21:48,503 --> 00:21:50,495
I tell you, that man's a miracle!

212
00:22:16,298 --> 00:22:18,788
Carol, you got gorgeous!

213
00:22:30,043 --> 00:22:31,943
Look at you.

214
00:22:40,252 --> 00:22:43,449
That was against Mid-City.
I'll never forget it.

215
00:22:44,891 --> 00:22:46,620
Fourth quarter, score was tied...

216
00:22:47,292 --> 00:22:49,557
...we're back at the 25 yard line.

217
00:22:49,796 --> 00:22:53,028
Coach sends in play,
Right Flanker Option.

218
00:23:02,941 --> 00:23:05,136
You really have grown, Clark.

219
00:23:05,344 --> 00:23:07,175
You look very well, Miss Bannister.

220
00:23:07,379 --> 00:23:12,147
I can't complain. I take the stairs
a little slow and I have these spells.

221
00:23:12,951 --> 00:23:14,885
But really, I can't complain.

222
00:23:15,854 --> 00:23:16,821
<i>Lana?</i>

223
00:23:17,989 --> 00:23:19,048
<i>Clark?</i>

224
00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:28,191
Would you excuse me? There's
someone I'd like to say hello to.

225
00:23:31,603 --> 00:23:32,795
Lana?

226
00:23:34,171 --> 00:23:37,333
- Lana Lang? It's great to see you.
- Clark.

227
00:23:38,675 --> 00:23:42,075
- You look wonderful.
- Me? No, you look... Wow!

228
00:23:42,279 --> 00:23:45,248
- Let me give you a hand with that.
- I can manage.

229
00:23:48,852 --> 00:23:52,014
First time you've come back
since your mom passed away.

230
00:23:52,221 --> 00:23:54,123
Yeah. I'm sorry.

231
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:58,220
I heard that you and...

232
00:23:59,195 --> 00:24:01,526
...Donald split up.
- Did you eat yet?

233
00:24:01,731 --> 00:24:02,789
No.

234
00:24:03,098 --> 00:24:05,761
Beg your pardon. Excuse me. Sorry.

235
00:24:09,639 --> 00:24:11,400
- That's not right.
- No?

236
00:24:11,607 --> 00:24:14,076
You're right about Donald and me...
Hold that.

237
00:24:14,277 --> 00:24:15,335
Oh, sure.

238
00:24:18,113 --> 00:24:19,581
- Hi, Kent.
- Oh.

239
00:24:19,949 --> 00:24:22,211
Hi. How you doing?

240
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:25,717
I'm sorry. I'm going nuts.

241
00:24:29,659 --> 00:24:31,557
- Clark.
- Yeah.

242
00:24:32,428 --> 00:24:33,588
Lana.

243
00:24:34,630 --> 00:24:35,789
Uh-oh.

244
00:24:36,966 --> 00:24:38,090
Hey, sweet.

245
00:24:38,434 --> 00:24:39,628
Here I am.

246
00:24:40,803 --> 00:24:44,966
Remember when you were prom queen?
All us guys were waiting for a dance?

247
00:24:45,173 --> 00:24:48,234
There's only one guy on your
dance card now. Good old...

248
00:24:48,444 --> 00:24:49,842
Brad Wilson.

249
00:24:50,410 --> 00:24:52,879
- Hi, Brad.
- Hi, Kent.

250
00:24:53,214 --> 00:24:54,943
Long time no see.

251
00:24:55,149 --> 00:24:57,048
You know, see, see, see?

252
00:24:57,718 --> 00:25:00,243
- Come on, Lana.
- No, I can't.

253
00:25:00,687 --> 00:25:01,915
Clark already asked me.

254
00:25:02,122 --> 00:25:03,613
- I did?
- Yeah.

255
00:25:03,825 --> 00:25:04,654
Excuse me.

256
00:25:05,726 --> 00:25:07,592
Lana, I haven't danced...

257
00:25:52,404 --> 00:25:55,203
Ah, Gorman.
Another week, another check.

258
00:25:58,109 --> 00:26:02,044
Don't you have another one for me?
I put in a voucher for expenses.

259
00:26:02,246 --> 00:26:03,544
What?

260
00:26:06,850 --> 00:26:07,910
Yeah, yeah.

261
00:26:08,254 --> 00:26:09,413
Here you go.

262
00:26:32,041 --> 00:26:33,806
Thanks for helping me out.

263
00:26:34,212 --> 00:26:36,702
A lot of guys would like
to be where I am.

264
00:26:36,947 --> 00:26:41,246
You'd be surprised at how many offers
I didn't get. Even Brad didn't stay.

265
00:26:41,451 --> 00:26:45,013
- It really isn't easy.
- The streamers? You just pull.

266
00:26:45,254 --> 00:26:47,745
No, not streamers. Everything.

267
00:26:47,957 --> 00:26:50,290
Not that I'm complaining.
It's just that...

268
00:26:50,494 --> 00:26:53,463
...I don't know why, I just feel
like I can talk to you.

269
00:26:53,797 --> 00:26:54,661
What?

270
00:26:54,864 --> 00:26:57,196
I feel like I can talk to you!

271
00:26:58,167 --> 00:26:59,725
- You can?
- Yes.

272
00:26:59,936 --> 00:27:01,905
- You know something, Lana?
- What?

273
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:05,306
I always...

274
00:27:06,042 --> 00:27:07,771
I always wished that you would.

275
00:27:07,977 --> 00:27:09,911
I mean, even back in high school.

276
00:27:10,145 --> 00:27:12,741
- Remember when you were...
- Queen of the prom.

277
00:27:13,350 --> 00:27:16,376
Three years after the royal wedding,
the king abdicated.

278
00:27:16,587 --> 00:27:18,075
Isn't that terrible?

279
00:27:18,287 --> 00:27:22,484
- Yeah, sure is.
- There's a ton of potato salad left.

280
00:27:23,392 --> 00:27:25,325
You know what the problem is?

281
00:27:26,393 --> 00:27:28,260
Don't know, too much mayonnaise?

282
00:27:28,464 --> 00:27:31,228
Donald loved mayonnaise.
Why would that be the problem?

283
00:27:31,434 --> 00:27:34,266
No, the problem is,
why do I stay in Smallville?

284
00:27:34,469 --> 00:27:36,231
I've asked myself that.

285
00:27:36,470 --> 00:27:40,964
Do you know how lucky you are to live
in Metropolis? The Big Apricot.

286
00:27:41,175 --> 00:27:45,340
- Well, you could...
- Easy to say. What about Ricky?

287
00:27:45,547 --> 00:27:46,411
Ricky?

288
00:27:46,615 --> 00:27:47,875
My little boy.

289
00:27:48,314 --> 00:27:50,408
- You? Oh, that's great.
- Yeah.

290
00:27:50,619 --> 00:27:55,147
At least here we have a house and
I've got a job that pays the bills.

291
00:27:55,356 --> 00:27:58,848
Except for last winter when
the fuel bills kept going up and up.

292
00:27:59,527 --> 00:28:02,291
Yeah. Even had to pawn
my diamond ring then.

293
00:28:02,662 --> 00:28:03,925
That's a shame.

294
00:28:11,672 --> 00:28:13,332
You never got married?

295
00:28:15,408 --> 00:28:17,035
- Me?
- Yeah.

296
00:28:17,545 --> 00:28:18,977
Well, I was...

297
00:28:20,446 --> 00:28:21,969
No. Not...

298
00:28:31,157 --> 00:28:34,058
Years later you can look at
someone and think...

299
00:28:34,294 --> 00:28:37,024
..."Well, I guess that's
the one that got away."

300
00:28:41,933 --> 00:28:45,495
Give me that again, old buddy.
Run it by me just one more time.

301
00:28:45,704 --> 00:28:48,195
- $85,000.
- Missing.

302
00:28:48,407 --> 00:28:51,934
Embezzled, Mr. Webster.
Stolen from the firm.

303
00:28:52,144 --> 00:28:53,338
By whom?

304
00:28:53,545 --> 00:28:56,036
That's what I want to know.
By whom? Whom?

305
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:57,873
Vera, get ahold of yourself.

306
00:28:58,784 --> 00:29:00,149
Nobody else ever will.

307
00:29:00,851 --> 00:29:02,012
I don't know.

308
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:03,187
Whom?

309
00:29:03,388 --> 00:29:05,548
In the old days, it was simple.

310
00:29:05,756 --> 00:29:10,090
We kept books, we knew what was
going in and what was paid out.

311
00:29:10,294 --> 00:29:11,955
If somebody wanted to rob you...

312
00:29:12,196 --> 00:29:14,663
...they'd use a gun and say,
"Stick 'em up."

313
00:29:14,899 --> 00:29:17,993
Now they get blasted computers
to do their dirty work.

314
00:29:18,603 --> 00:29:21,470
My friend, you are yesterday.

315
00:29:21,672 --> 00:29:24,538
Whoever pulled this caper,
is tomorrow.

316
00:29:26,677 --> 00:29:28,838
Mr. Webster,
it's time for your massage.

317
00:29:29,046 --> 00:29:30,706
Bubba, can she burst in...

318
00:29:30,947 --> 00:29:34,678
Now, now, Vera. Simpson,
you know my psychic nutritionist?

319
00:29:34,884 --> 00:29:39,014
- Hello.
- We are trying to hold a meeting here.

320
00:29:39,222 --> 00:29:43,283
Why don't you hold your breath
instead? Maybe you'll turn blue.

321
00:29:43,493 --> 00:29:46,757
- Improvement.
- I'm about to take a human life.

322
00:29:46,962 --> 00:29:50,090
Simpson, would you excuse us
for a second, please?

323
00:29:53,701 --> 00:29:56,729
- Mouths closed. Ears open.
- She's a big pig.

324
00:29:56,940 --> 00:30:00,033
I can't have anyone with me
who isn't with me.

325
00:30:00,377 --> 00:30:01,775
Now, girls.

326
00:30:02,211 --> 00:30:03,041
Simpson.

327
00:30:04,046 --> 00:30:05,479
Well, old chum. What now?

328
00:30:05,681 --> 00:30:08,377
Kiss the 85 thou goodbye?

329
00:30:08,583 --> 00:30:12,383
Keep on paying the thief his salary
until he shakes the money tree again?

330
00:30:12,586 --> 00:30:15,682
- He's bound to slip sooner or later.
- Why?

331
00:30:15,891 --> 00:30:18,223
That's what they always say
in the movies.

332
00:30:18,427 --> 00:30:20,918
He won't slip up at all.
No, not at all.

333
00:30:21,130 --> 00:30:23,756
He'll keep quietly taking
the bread from our mouths.

334
00:30:23,965 --> 00:30:28,197
He'll keep a low profile and won't do
a thing to call attention to himself.

335
00:30:28,404 --> 00:30:32,806
Unless, of course, he is
a complete and utter moron.

336
00:30:50,425 --> 00:30:52,187
I'll go first. Andrew.

337
00:30:52,392 --> 00:30:55,828
- I'll pick Chris.
- You feel good? You feel ready?

338
00:30:56,062 --> 00:30:57,361
Ricky, your shoe.

339
00:30:57,565 --> 00:31:00,796
- You mean, we've gotta take Ricky?
- You guys lost the toss.

340
00:31:01,002 --> 00:31:03,162
All right, come on Ricky.

341
00:31:03,370 --> 00:31:05,305
- Wait, wait...
- Come on, good luck.

342
00:31:06,439 --> 00:31:09,273
- I just can't stand this.
- Oh, Lana. It'll be okay.

343
00:31:09,476 --> 00:31:11,774
I know, I was a late bloomer myself.

344
00:31:11,978 --> 00:31:16,642
It's not just that he's small, he's
the only kid in town without a father.

345
00:31:17,083 --> 00:31:21,485
Oh, look. Stewed to the gills
in the middle of the afternoon.

346
00:31:21,686 --> 00:31:23,781
- I only had chocolate milk.
- No, him.

347
00:31:23,989 --> 00:31:25,456
Hey, sweet thing.

348
00:31:25,925 --> 00:31:27,893
Little kid getting hassled, huh?

349
00:31:28,493 --> 00:31:31,019
- Kent, you still here?
- I seem to be, Brad.

350
00:31:31,230 --> 00:31:33,926
All he needs is a few pointers
from the old champ here.

351
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:36,927
I won the all-country bowling trophy
two years in a row.

352
00:31:37,135 --> 00:31:38,160
I didn't know that.

353
00:31:38,370 --> 00:31:40,837
Yeah. Natural athlete
can play any sport.

354
00:31:41,974 --> 00:31:44,840
- It's all right. It'll be okay.
- He'll make it worse.

355
00:31:51,282 --> 00:31:53,273
You watch, he'll get a spare.

356
00:31:53,618 --> 00:31:54,585
Come on, Ricky.

357
00:31:56,453 --> 00:31:58,252
Kid, you're holding it all wrong.

358
00:31:58,822 --> 00:32:02,123
- Let old Brad show you how it's done.
- Brad.

359
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:07,087
Excuse me. Say, Brad, I think maybe
he'll be better off doing it his way.

360
00:32:07,297 --> 00:32:10,824
For a guy lucky to be waterboy,
you've got a big mouth.

361
00:32:11,235 --> 00:32:14,295
I don't think he needs a lesson
in front of the other kids.

362
00:32:14,505 --> 00:32:18,440
- He needs a man to show him.
- He's doing just fine. Excuse me.

363
00:32:20,277 --> 00:32:21,609
Here you go, Ricky.

364
00:32:21,812 --> 00:32:24,747
And give it your best shot.
Okay? There you go.

365
00:32:27,185 --> 00:32:28,412
Sorry.

366
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:45,899
Gesundheit.

367
00:32:46,102 --> 00:32:47,228
Thank you.

368
00:32:50,306 --> 00:32:52,535
Hey, Gus, the boss wants to see you.

369
00:32:52,741 --> 00:32:55,302
He can see me all right.
Hello, Mr. Lewis.

370
00:32:55,511 --> 00:32:58,946
No, not that boss. The boss.

371
00:33:00,116 --> 00:33:01,581
You mean, the boss...

372
00:33:01,783 --> 00:33:03,274
...wants to see me?

373
00:33:03,486 --> 00:33:06,579
Oh, my God,
why would he want to see me?

374
00:33:06,789 --> 00:33:07,981
I mean...

375
00:33:09,257 --> 00:33:11,588
Why would the boss want to see me?

376
00:33:12,861 --> 00:33:14,522
There's no reason.

377
00:33:15,796 --> 00:33:17,321
Then why'd he?
Oh, I know!

378
00:33:17,533 --> 00:33:20,591
It's my suggestion for
the volleyball uniforms.

379
00:33:20,801 --> 00:33:22,030
That's it.

380
00:33:34,615 --> 00:33:37,811
Ross the boss. Ross the boss.
The boss!

381
00:33:38,752 --> 00:33:40,845
Be calm. Be cool. Be collected.

382
00:33:45,558 --> 00:33:48,551
Mr. Webster? Mr. Webster?

383
00:33:49,096 --> 00:33:52,395
Mr. Webster, I did not...
Mr. Webster.

384
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:54,858
Mr. August Gorman?

385
00:33:55,068 --> 00:33:56,229
August Gorman here.

386
00:33:56,437 --> 00:34:00,964
I know you're a man of compassion,
and I don't want to go to jail...

387
00:34:01,174 --> 00:34:03,166
...because they have
robbers and rapists...

388
00:34:03,376 --> 00:34:05,742
I just want to ask you one question.

389
00:34:05,945 --> 00:34:08,710
You've been a naughty guy,
haven't you?

390
00:34:08,915 --> 00:34:10,313
Come on, admit it, now.

391
00:34:10,515 --> 00:34:13,041
You've been a little bit naughty,
haven't you?

392
00:34:13,253 --> 00:34:16,017
- I was kind of...
- That's all right. I understand.

393
00:34:16,222 --> 00:34:19,385
I can...
What do the young folks say today?

394
00:34:19,592 --> 00:34:22,254
"Dig where you're coming from,
brother."

395
00:34:22,462 --> 00:34:25,294
You want to be rich, right?

396
00:34:25,497 --> 00:34:29,024
I was born rich. Never worn
the same pair of socks twice.

397
00:34:29,234 --> 00:34:30,725
What do you do with your socks?

398
00:34:30,937 --> 00:34:34,805
They're laundered and sent to
some charitable institution, I think.

399
00:34:35,007 --> 00:34:38,204
I don't know.
Maybe they turn them into rags...

400
00:34:38,410 --> 00:34:39,842
...or pen-wipers or something.

401
00:34:40,044 --> 00:34:41,707
Or maybe socks.

402
00:34:41,915 --> 00:34:44,644
Yes! That never occurred to me.

403
00:34:44,850 --> 00:34:48,650
Gus, you know something?
You're a genius.

404
00:34:48,886 --> 00:34:52,515
A naughty genius, but what the hell?
Nobody's perfect. Cheers.

405
00:34:52,723 --> 00:34:55,749
Because of the half-cent thing
with the computers.

406
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:58,861
No, no, because computers rule
the world today.

407
00:34:59,063 --> 00:35:02,726
The fellow that can fool the computers
can rule the world himself.

408
00:35:03,701 --> 00:35:07,193
I've been searching for somebody
who can make these machines do...

409
00:35:07,405 --> 00:35:09,737
...what they're not supposed to.
Get my drift?

410
00:35:10,141 --> 00:35:11,336
Yes!

411
00:35:12,008 --> 00:35:16,808
Webscoe, the Webscoe industrial
complex, is a family-owned cartel.

412
00:35:17,013 --> 00:35:18,878
Some magnesium here,
some zinc there.

413
00:35:19,082 --> 00:35:21,051
Railroads, farm machinery.
You follow?

414
00:35:21,251 --> 00:35:22,741
I follow you, sir.

415
00:35:22,953 --> 00:35:25,148
Gus, do you know what I want now?

416
00:35:25,355 --> 00:35:26,286
I want coffee.

417
00:35:26,489 --> 00:35:28,217
Black, cream, sugar, or?

418
00:35:28,424 --> 00:35:30,484
No, you don't seem to understand.

419
00:35:30,694 --> 00:35:34,130
Under different company names,
I control the price of coffee beans...

420
00:35:34,331 --> 00:35:38,460
...in Venezuela, Brazil, Bolivia,
Jamaica and the Republic of Gabon.

421
00:35:38,668 --> 00:35:42,434
But I've got a problem and I think
maybe you can help me.

422
00:35:42,639 --> 00:35:46,598
One country won't play ball with me.
You know how that can bug a guy.

423
00:35:46,810 --> 00:35:49,073
That could bug...
What country?

424
00:35:50,447 --> 00:35:51,537
Colombia.

425
00:35:51,746 --> 00:35:52,645
Colombia?

426
00:35:52,848 --> 00:35:55,873
Colombia has two import and exports,
and one of them's coffee.

427
00:35:56,084 --> 00:35:59,713
And I've tried to reason with them.
Believe me, I've tried.

428
00:35:59,921 --> 00:36:03,049
But this one miserable,
pissant little country...

429
00:36:03,258 --> 00:36:07,524
...has the gall to think it can
dictate the economy of an open market.

430
00:36:09,198 --> 00:36:11,427
Gus, my friend...

431
00:36:12,267 --> 00:36:15,064
...we're going to teach them
a lesson, aren't we?

432
00:36:16,105 --> 00:36:18,937
Destroy the entire
Colombian coffee crop...

433
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:21,664
...right down to the last bean.

434
00:36:21,875 --> 00:36:24,070
- The last bean, we are.
- Right.

435
00:36:24,277 --> 00:36:27,679
But you got so much...

436
00:36:27,882 --> 00:36:30,509
A wise man once said, I think
it was Attila the Hun:

437
00:36:30,717 --> 00:36:33,311
"It is not enough that I succeed.

438
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:36,456
Everyone else must fail."

439
00:36:36,723 --> 00:36:38,213
Seems fair.

440
00:36:38,525 --> 00:36:39,958
- Gus.
- What?

441
00:36:40,161 --> 00:36:43,857
You are going to do this for me.

442
00:36:46,433 --> 00:36:48,594
- How?
- The weather.

443
00:36:49,301 --> 00:36:50,998
You didn't say your mom was here.

444
00:36:51,205 --> 00:36:54,138
I'm his sister. His baby sister.

445
00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:57,367
Gus, tell me, have you ever
heard of Vulcan?

446
00:36:57,643 --> 00:36:59,008
Hi, Ms. Vulcan.

447
00:36:59,211 --> 00:37:01,943
Vulcan is the weather satellite
our government put up...

448
00:37:02,150 --> 00:37:03,512
...to monitor the weather.

449
00:37:03,716 --> 00:37:07,948
But if somebody were to reprogram it,
it could do much more.

450
00:37:08,154 --> 00:37:09,781
It could make weather.

451
00:37:09,989 --> 00:37:11,479
Storms and floods.

452
00:37:11,690 --> 00:37:13,453
Blizzards, heat waves.

453
00:37:13,659 --> 00:37:14,819
How do you do that?

454
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:18,525
Like everything else
in the 20th century, Gus.

455
00:37:18,730 --> 00:37:20,221
You push buttons.

456
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:25,063
- There you go.
- It's the first time I won anything.

457
00:37:25,271 --> 00:37:26,497
You won my hand, Maury.

458
00:37:26,703 --> 00:37:29,538
But this is the first time
I won anything valuable.

459
00:37:29,742 --> 00:37:31,368
Let's get one with the sombreros.

460
00:37:31,575 --> 00:37:34,977
Mr. White, you'll be in this,
handing them their plane tickets.

461
00:37:35,180 --> 00:37:37,512
- Why do I have to do this?
- Why do I have to do this?

462
00:37:37,714 --> 00:37:41,116
You're lucky I didn't fire you.
I get a chance at exclusive photos...

463
00:37:41,318 --> 00:37:42,980
...of history's biggest
factory fire.

464
00:37:43,188 --> 00:37:45,883
He comes home with a broken leg
and 12 melted rolls of film.

465
00:37:46,090 --> 00:37:47,524
It was hot.

466
00:37:47,725 --> 00:37:49,852
Smile, Mr. White.

467
00:37:50,894 --> 00:37:53,659
South America!
I can't believe my luck!

468
00:37:53,965 --> 00:37:56,933
See, if you don't want them
to trace it back...

469
00:37:57,134 --> 00:38:00,195
...you've gotta punch in
to some little rinky-dink outfit...

470
00:38:00,405 --> 00:38:02,838
...that has a little
Mickey Mouse computer...

471
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:06,008
Someplace you can sneak into, right?

472
00:38:06,209 --> 00:38:07,370
Somebody could...

473
00:38:07,578 --> 00:38:11,605
Someplace where nobody knows him
so they can't connect him with us.

474
00:38:11,815 --> 00:38:13,782
Webscoe has 112 subsidiaries.

475
00:38:13,983 --> 00:38:16,952
They're all linked into
the central computer system.

476
00:38:17,153 --> 00:38:18,746
How about someplace...

477
00:38:19,689 --> 00:38:20,780
...small?

478
00:38:23,426 --> 00:38:27,418
Whoa, there. This is Smallville.
We'll have a five-minute stop here.

479
00:38:28,364 --> 00:38:29,456
Mind your step.

480
00:38:29,665 --> 00:38:31,427
Watch your step, please.

481
00:38:32,169 --> 00:38:33,136
Thanks, Selma.

482
00:38:33,336 --> 00:38:35,804
Thanks a lot, Lana.
Have a good day, now.

483
00:38:40,041 --> 00:38:41,566
Let me help you, Lana.

484
00:38:43,446 --> 00:38:45,141
I'm sorry.

485
00:38:47,850 --> 00:38:50,215
- Thanks, Clark.
- Sit down, Buster. Good boy.

486
00:38:50,418 --> 00:38:52,909
Come on, Buster, sit down.
Good boy.

487
00:38:53,121 --> 00:38:55,021
You all set? Great.

488
00:39:08,102 --> 00:39:09,831
I'm not saying another word.

489
00:39:10,304 --> 00:39:11,499
That's it.

490
00:39:14,875 --> 00:39:17,139
Jesus Christ!

491
00:39:21,782 --> 00:39:24,842
Don't they have picnics in Metropolis,
Mr. Kent?

492
00:39:25,052 --> 00:39:26,986
Well, not quite like this, Ricky.

493
00:39:27,188 --> 00:39:29,155
- Mom and I do this all the time.
- You do?

494
00:39:29,355 --> 00:39:32,323
- I'll help you.
- Stay close by and be careful, okay?

495
00:39:32,524 --> 00:39:33,823
Okay, Mom.

496
00:39:34,028 --> 00:39:37,395
Come on, Buster. Let's find you
a rabbit. Come on. Rabbit.

497
00:39:37,598 --> 00:39:39,531
This is so nice for him.

498
00:39:39,732 --> 00:39:43,099
It's even nicer when there's
a man around, which isn't that often.

499
00:39:43,302 --> 00:39:45,636
- There's a lot of choices.
- The good ones are married.

500
00:39:45,839 --> 00:39:48,363
So Brad thinks he's
God's gift to women.

501
00:39:49,042 --> 00:39:52,033
He won't take no for an answer,
but he's the only one asking.

502
00:39:52,245 --> 00:39:54,872
No, Lana, I meant
there's a lot of choices here.

503
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:57,606
This is really quite some picnic.
There's...

504
00:39:58,416 --> 00:39:59,715
...some of that.

505
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:02,415
Green stuff.

506
00:40:03,923 --> 00:40:05,549
Hey, pâté.

507
00:40:07,859 --> 00:40:10,294
Boy, this pâté is really unusual.

508
00:40:10,829 --> 00:40:13,127
I didn't make any...
Oh, Clark.

509
00:40:13,332 --> 00:40:15,595
That's Buster's dog food.

510
00:40:16,501 --> 00:40:17,990
- It's good.
- Don't eat it!

511
00:40:18,203 --> 00:40:19,568
What time's the dog eat?

512
00:40:19,771 --> 00:40:21,635
- This is nice.
- Here.

513
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:23,364
It's all right, Lana.

514
00:40:24,977 --> 00:40:26,170
Thanks.

515
00:40:27,980 --> 00:40:29,879
Hey, where you going?
Come on!

516
00:40:30,081 --> 00:40:31,982
Buster, stop messing about!

517
00:40:35,387 --> 00:40:36,876
- How much longer?
- I thought...

518
00:40:37,087 --> 00:40:39,887
- Sorry. No, go ahead.
- You.

519
00:40:46,398 --> 00:40:48,227
I was just thinking that...

520
00:40:48,432 --> 00:40:51,401
...somebody like you could do
really well in Metropolis.

521
00:40:51,935 --> 00:40:56,269
I have to face it. I'm not gonna
find what I want in Smallville anymore.

522
00:40:58,842 --> 00:41:02,540
Could I make it in Metropolis?
What would I do when I got there?

523
00:41:05,048 --> 00:41:06,038
Call me.

524
00:41:06,249 --> 00:41:09,218
- No, I wouldn't want to call you.
- You don't want to call?

525
00:41:09,419 --> 00:41:13,752
Yes, I want to call you, but I
wouldn't want to be a nuisance to you.

526
00:41:14,257 --> 00:41:16,885
I don't think you could ever
be a nuisance to me.

527
00:41:19,295 --> 00:41:20,957
Clark, may I tell you something?

528
00:41:24,968 --> 00:41:26,400
My oil pan is leaking.

529
00:41:32,340 --> 00:41:34,138
There's something dripping.

530
00:41:34,343 --> 00:41:35,901
- Can I help?
- No, thanks.

531
00:41:36,512 --> 00:41:39,912
With all the car trouble I have,
I studied up on auto repair.

532
00:41:40,483 --> 00:41:42,004
Look at this.

533
00:41:42,950 --> 00:41:44,510
Oh, boy.

534
00:42:11,012 --> 00:42:14,538
I think I'll just go see
if Ricky's all right. You okay?

535
00:43:02,962 --> 00:43:04,986
Gosh, is he all right?

536
00:43:17,308 --> 00:43:18,832
Superman?

537
00:43:19,043 --> 00:43:20,373
That's me.

538
00:43:23,313 --> 00:43:25,145
Mom! Mom!

539
00:43:27,585 --> 00:43:30,986
There you go. He's all right,
but have a doctor check him.

540
00:43:31,189 --> 00:43:32,917
Thank you.

541
00:43:33,123 --> 00:43:35,557
- I'm Lana Lang. This is Ricky.
- Nice to meet you.

542
00:43:35,759 --> 00:43:36,920
And this is Clark.

543
00:43:37,128 --> 00:43:39,994
I really have to be going.
So long, Ricky. Bye.

544
00:43:42,433 --> 00:43:43,832
We were flying, Mom!

545
00:43:44,034 --> 00:43:45,468
What were you doing, anyway?

546
00:43:45,669 --> 00:43:47,397
I was looking for Buster.

547
00:43:48,839 --> 00:43:50,033
I found him!

548
00:43:51,308 --> 00:43:52,774
Come on, boy. That's it.

549
00:43:52,975 --> 00:43:55,603
Mr. Kent, Superman was here!

550
00:43:55,812 --> 00:43:57,906
- What?
- Yes, he really was.

551
00:43:58,815 --> 00:44:00,373
Aren't you excited?

552
00:44:00,584 --> 00:44:03,643
I'm from Metropolis.
I see Superman every day.

553
00:44:03,853 --> 00:44:06,844
You do? Could you get me
his autograph?

554
00:44:09,426 --> 00:44:13,327
I don't know. If I had a nickel
for every time some little kid...

555
00:44:36,350 --> 00:44:37,682
Yeah? What do you want?

556
00:44:37,886 --> 00:44:39,616
We're in big trouble, aren't we?

557
00:44:39,822 --> 00:44:41,652
- What?
- We're in big trouble.

558
00:44:41,857 --> 00:44:43,347
First, they lost the invoice.

559
00:44:43,558 --> 00:44:47,187
When they found it, they realized
they came up short on a few items.

560
00:44:47,395 --> 00:44:51,591
So I rented a car because I missed the
plane from Cleveland. 4:00, you know.

561
00:44:52,032 --> 00:44:55,297
And a flat tire on the highway.
What a kicker.

562
00:44:55,503 --> 00:44:58,631
Had to fix it myself
with these little pinkies.

563
00:44:59,107 --> 00:45:03,407
And I figured your boss was gonna be
real peeved, you know what I mean?

564
00:45:03,777 --> 00:45:04,765
What do you mean?

565
00:45:04,978 --> 00:45:07,675
He is going to hang our butts
against the wall.

566
00:45:08,148 --> 00:45:10,741
He wanted this special order
installed...

567
00:45:10,950 --> 00:45:13,545
...in his office by tomorrow morning.

568
00:45:13,754 --> 00:45:15,983
So let me in because
I gotta set it up tonight.

569
00:45:16,190 --> 00:45:17,452
Get all what set up?

570
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:31,297
Pal, you are a real lifesaver.
I mean, a real lifesaver.

571
00:45:31,504 --> 00:45:33,698
- Which way's the office?
- Straight ahead.

572
00:45:33,906 --> 00:45:36,569
- Follow me.
- I'm right behind you.

573
00:45:38,277 --> 00:45:40,769
Not bad. It's pretty good.

574
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:44,078
You know what's wrong with
this Singapore... wing?

575
00:45:44,284 --> 00:45:48,014
Sling! Singapore Sling.

576
00:45:48,220 --> 00:45:50,484
What's wrong with it?

577
00:45:50,690 --> 00:45:52,553
There's not enough vodka in it.

578
00:45:52,756 --> 00:45:55,387
There's no vodka in it!

579
00:45:55,595 --> 00:45:58,119
What did I tell you?
Put some vodka in it.

580
00:45:58,330 --> 00:46:01,128
What did you... you know?

581
00:46:07,371 --> 00:46:10,102
Here. There's vodka in it now, buddy.

582
00:46:14,378 --> 00:46:15,367
Yeah, perfect.

583
00:46:15,746 --> 00:46:18,681
- You never do pass out, do you?
- Nope.

584
00:46:23,054 --> 00:46:24,282
Never.

585
00:46:25,222 --> 00:46:27,314
Job well done, buddy.

586
00:46:27,725 --> 00:46:30,058
You thought I was drunk too,
didn't you?

587
00:46:30,761 --> 00:46:31,727
Fooled you.

588
00:46:31,928 --> 00:46:34,454
Get the keys, get the keys.

589
00:46:59,155 --> 00:47:00,950
Hello, baby!

590
00:47:01,723 --> 00:47:03,215
How's the little baby?

591
00:47:05,293 --> 00:47:09,094
All right, let's get down to it.
Let's do it.

592
00:47:10,799 --> 00:47:13,893
One, two, button your shoe.

593
00:47:30,052 --> 00:47:34,351
"Both keys at the same time"?

594
00:47:48,635 --> 00:47:50,365
Wait. Wait a minute.

595
00:47:50,604 --> 00:47:52,368
Think you've won, don't you?

596
00:47:53,875 --> 00:47:56,002
The Philly Flash!

597
00:48:46,791 --> 00:48:48,884
Okay, ready?

598
00:48:49,962 --> 00:48:51,951
One, two, three!

599
00:49:05,203 --> 00:49:07,295
We'll see what we'll see.

600
00:51:27,105 --> 00:51:28,298
Come on, please.

601
00:51:31,207 --> 00:51:32,436
There it is!

602
00:51:32,643 --> 00:51:34,134
Hello! Now...

603
00:51:34,346 --> 00:51:36,039
...getting down to business.

604
00:51:39,116 --> 00:51:41,016
I am a genius.

605
00:51:42,553 --> 00:51:44,180
I am a...

606
00:51:53,430 --> 00:51:54,793
Longitude...

607
00:51:54,998 --> 00:51:57,795
...and the other thing.
Latitude, right?

608
00:52:14,716 --> 00:52:17,584
Oh, look, Maury.
A native wedding.

609
00:52:42,576 --> 00:52:45,705
<i>No one said at the Daily Planet
that this is the rainy season!</i>

610
00:53:23,616 --> 00:53:26,744
<i>Meteorologists are baffled by
the tornado and rainstorms...</i>

611
00:53:26,953 --> 00:53:29,751
<i>... that struck Colombia
this afternoon...</i>

612
00:53:29,956 --> 00:53:34,483
<i>... threatening to destroy its entire
coffee crop for the next five years.</i>

613
00:53:34,693 --> 00:53:36,321
<i>Gale force winds up to...</i>

614
00:53:36,529 --> 00:53:39,623
...an incredible 250 miles an hour
lashed the countryside...

615
00:53:40,134 --> 00:53:44,535
...while 12 inches of rainfall have
already been recorded in just one day.

616
00:53:45,203 --> 00:53:49,470
<i>A spokesman for the Department of
Meteorology said, this was, I quote:</i>

617
00:53:49,675 --> 00:53:53,372
<i>"The most awesome display of
natural forces since Noah's ark. "</i>

618
00:53:53,579 --> 00:53:56,411
If I laugh any harder,
I'll split my sides!

619
00:53:56,614 --> 00:53:59,708
<i>- To defy all laws of
weather systems known to science.</i>

620
00:54:02,888 --> 00:54:03,945
What a shame.

621
00:54:05,891 --> 00:54:08,450
Poor little Colombia. Well...

622
00:54:19,637 --> 00:54:22,162
I'm gonna get you for that,
you big silly!

623
00:54:22,373 --> 00:54:25,274
Bubba, do you realize
what we're onto?

624
00:54:25,476 --> 00:54:27,034
Do I?

625
00:54:27,245 --> 00:54:30,338
Every time a drunk sobers up,
he'll drink Webster coffee.

626
00:54:30,547 --> 00:54:32,539
Why stop at coffee?

627
00:54:32,917 --> 00:54:36,647
A cup of coffee gets the world
off to work in the morning.

628
00:54:36,853 --> 00:54:38,946
But what keeps the world working?

629
00:54:39,822 --> 00:54:40,812
Diet soda?

630
00:54:42,093 --> 00:54:44,185
Vera, you mean?
You mean?

631
00:54:44,394 --> 00:54:46,794
Today, coffee.

632
00:54:46,997 --> 00:54:48,522
Tomorrow...

633
00:54:48,733 --> 00:54:49,561
...the oil!

634
00:54:49,765 --> 00:54:51,859
- Oil?
- If Gus can push the right buttons...

635
00:54:52,069 --> 00:54:55,094
I can have it all.
Holy cats!

636
00:54:55,305 --> 00:54:56,896
All the oil.

637
00:54:57,106 --> 00:54:58,300
All the pumps.

638
00:54:58,507 --> 00:54:59,941
All the tankers.

639
00:55:00,143 --> 00:55:01,701
This is some nifty idea, Vera.

640
00:55:01,912 --> 00:55:03,572
- Boss?
- Very nifty.

641
00:55:03,780 --> 00:55:06,247
- Just the man I want to see.
- It's not my fault.

642
00:55:06,449 --> 00:55:08,144
Isn't it neat? There...

643
00:55:08,417 --> 00:55:10,249
- What's not your fault?
- Superman.

644
00:55:10,954 --> 00:55:13,546
How was I to know he'd start
doing his thing...

645
00:55:13,756 --> 00:55:15,814
...when you started doing your thing?

646
00:55:16,024 --> 00:55:18,789
- What are you talking about?
- What am I talk?

647
00:55:18,994 --> 00:55:21,894
It was just on television, man.
Didn't you see it?

648
00:55:22,096 --> 00:55:23,461
Don't call me "man."

649
00:55:23,665 --> 00:55:25,930
I just saw Colombia bite the dust.

650
00:55:26,135 --> 00:55:30,367
You didn't see the man come flying
out of the sky? It was him!

651
00:55:30,873 --> 00:55:33,102
With his cape flapping in the...

652
00:55:37,879 --> 00:55:39,506
His cape was flapping in the wind!

653
00:55:39,714 --> 00:55:41,977
He was flying! He was great!

654
00:55:42,182 --> 00:55:43,980
He was just flying around...

655
00:55:44,252 --> 00:55:47,619
<i>His cape was blowing in the wind.
It looked like a flag!</i>

656
00:55:48,822 --> 00:55:51,757
And he landed right in the middle
of this big plantation!

657
00:55:54,095 --> 00:55:57,326
And he checked everything out
with his x-ray vision.

658
00:55:57,532 --> 00:56:02,059
And then he put these laser beams
out of his eyes onto everything.

659
00:56:02,870 --> 00:56:04,429
<i>Straight-out laser points.</i>

660
00:56:05,105 --> 00:56:06,936
<i>Dried up everything!</i>

661
00:56:07,140 --> 00:56:08,608
Just like that!

662
00:56:08,810 --> 00:56:11,869
Dried it up,
like the machines in the men's rooms.

663
00:56:12,079 --> 00:56:13,046
You know what I mean?

664
00:56:13,247 --> 00:56:15,545
Hot air comes out when you put
your hands under.

665
00:56:15,749 --> 00:56:17,409
Sometimes they don't work.

666
00:56:17,617 --> 00:56:18,915
But Superman's works!

667
00:56:19,119 --> 00:56:22,144
You think he stood around
to take bows? Not this man.

668
00:56:22,355 --> 00:56:24,948
No, sir. He flies off again!

669
00:56:25,156 --> 00:56:27,591
Then he saw what
really caused the trouble.

670
00:56:27,793 --> 00:56:29,555
He flew into the tornado...

671
00:56:29,762 --> 00:56:33,391
...went down to the bottom of it,
and turned it upside down!

672
00:56:33,599 --> 00:56:37,000
<i>He made the little end on top
and the big end on the bottom!</i>

673
00:56:37,203 --> 00:56:39,602
I was gonna go crazy!

674
00:56:43,408 --> 00:56:44,966
Big end was on the bottom.

675
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:50,347
Mr. Ross, it was...
The big...

676
00:56:53,151 --> 00:56:54,413
Superman's bad.

677
00:56:55,453 --> 00:56:56,920
I'll say he was.

678
00:56:57,122 --> 00:56:59,317
I mean, he was bad!

679
00:56:59,623 --> 00:57:00,682
No.

680
00:57:04,295 --> 00:57:05,661
Here, let me help.

681
00:57:05,865 --> 00:57:09,196
- The perfect plan. Foolproof!
- And we were the fools.

682
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:13,200
It's not my fault.
I did what I was supposed to do.

683
00:57:13,705 --> 00:57:17,367
He ruined it.
That lousy do-gooder ruined it.

684
00:57:18,876 --> 00:57:23,505
Now that he's pulled off this stunt,
he'll try and ruin my oil scheme too.

685
00:57:25,481 --> 00:57:27,210
- I've got to get rid of him.
- How?

686
00:57:27,417 --> 00:57:29,476
Shoot him?
You know about him and bullets.

687
00:57:29,986 --> 00:57:31,954
- Kryptonite.
- What?

688
00:57:33,289 --> 00:57:36,689
Or krypton-ham, or krypton-heimer?

689
00:57:37,060 --> 00:57:40,189
I forget what you call it,
but it's stuff that can hurt Superman.

690
00:57:40,396 --> 00:57:43,229
- How do you know?
- I know a few things.

691
00:57:43,433 --> 00:57:44,956
I know,
from the graffiti I saw.

692
00:57:45,167 --> 00:57:46,533
Wait a second.

693
00:57:46,736 --> 00:57:47,897
She's right.

694
00:57:48,104 --> 00:57:51,301
I remember reading about it
in an interview with him.

695
00:57:51,506 --> 00:57:52,734
Where is it from?

696
00:57:52,942 --> 00:57:55,206
The planet Superman came from:
Krypton.

697
00:57:55,411 --> 00:57:56,844
Where is Krypton?

698
00:57:57,046 --> 00:57:58,342
It's nowhere.

699
00:57:58,547 --> 00:58:00,175
It blew up in space, years ago.

700
00:58:00,383 --> 00:58:03,875
They sent Superman here from there
when he was just a baby.

701
00:58:04,087 --> 00:58:05,179
I know some things too.

702
00:58:05,388 --> 00:58:08,879
Wait a minute. You know what happens
when a planet explodes.

703
00:58:09,091 --> 00:58:12,618
- Debris. Things floating in space.
- So?

704
00:58:12,828 --> 00:58:16,730
So all we have to do is find out
where in heaven Krypton used to be.

705
00:58:16,932 --> 00:58:19,833
Then good ol' Gus contacts
the Vulcan satellite.

706
00:58:20,034 --> 00:58:22,162
OI' Gus has been doing some thinking.

707
00:58:22,371 --> 00:58:24,235
That's why I keep you around.

708
00:58:24,706 --> 00:58:28,732
I've been thinking that I'm not making
enough money for this gig.

709
00:58:29,445 --> 00:58:32,777
Gus, if there's anything I hate...

710
00:58:33,516 --> 00:58:34,707
...it's greed.

711
00:58:34,914 --> 00:58:38,009
Greed? Mr. Ross, just a minute.

712
00:58:38,219 --> 00:58:40,085
Let me tell you something.

713
00:58:40,588 --> 00:58:42,021
I can't ski!

714
00:59:14,654 --> 00:59:16,747
<i>Once Gus contacts
the Vulcan satellite...</i>

715
00:59:16,956 --> 00:59:18,890
<i>... he orders it to search
through space...</i>

716
00:59:19,092 --> 00:59:21,890
<i>... around where Krypton
went bye-bye.</i>

717
00:59:31,370 --> 00:59:34,965
<i>Then the laser probe locks
onto a floating chunk of Kryptonite.</i>

718
00:59:35,174 --> 00:59:37,198
<i>The computer analyzes
the components...</i>

719
00:59:37,408 --> 00:59:40,708
<i>... and the boys at the lab
duplicate the stuff down here.</i>

720
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:43,110
"Unknown"?

721
00:59:43,581 --> 00:59:45,141
"Unknown"?

722
01:00:02,332 --> 01:00:04,495
What the hell,
he ain't gonna smoke it.

723
01:00:10,509 --> 01:00:12,998
Mr. White can't be responsible.

724
01:00:15,246 --> 01:00:16,438
Where is he?

725
01:00:16,645 --> 01:00:18,238
Please, Mr. Stokis.

726
01:00:18,682 --> 01:00:20,377
He'll pay for this.

727
01:00:21,885 --> 01:00:23,410
Get out your wallet!

728
01:00:24,420 --> 01:00:25,251
Good morning.

729
01:00:25,454 --> 01:00:27,685
Don't you "good morning" me.

730
01:00:29,126 --> 01:00:33,324
"Old, old relationships
suddenly seem very much the same.

731
01:00:33,630 --> 01:00:35,153
The prettiest girl in the school..."

732
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,298
- is still the prettiest girl
in the school.

733
01:00:43,873 --> 01:00:47,138
<i>- Hello?
- Hello. Oh, hi, Clark.</i>

734
01:00:47,343 --> 01:00:51,905
Lana! Hi, I was just
thinking about you.

735
01:00:53,650 --> 01:00:55,844
Listen, I have a problem with Ricky.

736
01:00:56,051 --> 01:00:57,313
What happened to Ricky?

737
01:00:57,520 --> 01:01:01,012
It's Superman's autograph you got him.
He got carried away...

738
01:01:01,223 --> 01:01:04,247
...and told the kids Superman was
coming on his birthday.

739
01:01:04,459 --> 01:01:05,688
Okay, it was wrong...

740
01:01:05,895 --> 01:01:09,558
...but when Wednesday comes
and Superman doesn't show up...

741
01:01:10,564 --> 01:01:14,193
Lana, in this case I think I can go
ahead and speak for Superman.

742
01:01:14,401 --> 01:01:16,427
I mean, he and I are
pretty close.

743
01:01:16,638 --> 01:01:20,665
You can tell Ricky that Superman
will be there on Wednesday, all right?

744
01:01:22,410 --> 01:01:25,845
Well, he's gonna get the best
home-cooked meal he's had...

745
01:01:26,214 --> 01:01:27,374
...in a long time.

746
01:01:27,582 --> 01:01:29,514
<i>Tell Superman we think
he's wonderful.</i>

747
01:01:29,715 --> 01:01:30,547
All right.

748
01:01:30,785 --> 01:01:32,842
<i>- But, Clark...
- Yeah?</i>

749
01:01:33,219 --> 01:01:34,620
...you're the best.

750
01:01:39,160 --> 01:01:42,027
And I'll take it to
the Supreme Court if I have to.

751
01:01:42,230 --> 01:01:45,529
But it wasn't our fault.
It was an act of God.

752
01:01:45,732 --> 01:01:47,528
In a church?

753
01:02:00,279 --> 01:02:01,247
Hey!

754
01:02:01,448 --> 01:02:03,415
Here's that compound you ordered.

755
01:02:03,616 --> 01:02:05,481
Can't imagine what you want with it.

756
01:02:05,685 --> 01:02:07,050
But you got it.

757
01:02:13,359 --> 01:02:16,259
What the hell am I afraid for?
I'm from Earth.

758
01:02:21,967 --> 01:02:24,163
I really wasn't expecting all this.

759
01:02:24,371 --> 01:02:26,894
I guess they did get
a little carried away.

760
01:02:40,752 --> 01:02:43,984
Superman, we all know...

761
01:02:44,656 --> 01:02:47,386
...that you're not looking for
honors and awards.

762
01:02:48,226 --> 01:02:51,820
But when we heard that you were
coming to see your pal Ricky...

763
01:02:52,029 --> 01:02:55,829
...we realized that this was
our chance to say thank you.

764
01:02:56,033 --> 01:02:58,399
First, for putting out
the Lake Camooga fire.

765
01:02:58,904 --> 01:03:02,134
And not least, for saving
little Ricky.

766
01:03:02,640 --> 01:03:05,301
So since you already have
the key to our hearts...

767
01:03:05,509 --> 01:03:07,637
...Superman...

768
01:03:07,845 --> 01:03:11,906
...may I present you
with the key to the city.

769
01:03:12,116 --> 01:03:13,481
Thank you, sir.

770
01:03:17,553 --> 01:03:18,749
Thank you.

771
01:03:35,203 --> 01:03:36,899
As you were.

772
01:03:39,875 --> 01:03:41,241
Now listen up.

773
01:03:41,711 --> 01:03:43,506
I just came in directly...

774
01:03:43,712 --> 01:03:45,907
...from the Pentagon...

775
01:03:46,113 --> 01:03:50,209
...and you better believe there's
a damn good reason that I did.

776
01:03:51,254 --> 01:03:53,516
Because God has given us...

777
01:03:53,721 --> 01:03:57,180
...one of the greatest gifts
in the world:

778
01:03:57,591 --> 01:03:59,321
Chemicals.

779
01:04:00,362 --> 01:04:04,957
Now you people, you like to go sit
in church on Sunday, don't you?

780
01:04:05,334 --> 01:04:07,824
You like to sit and watch
the Super Bowl.

781
01:04:08,036 --> 01:04:09,024
Yeah.

782
01:04:09,236 --> 01:04:11,296
Sit on what?!

783
01:04:12,707 --> 01:04:16,905
You sit on molded, plastic seats!

784
01:04:17,678 --> 01:04:21,274
Molded to your well-fed behinds.

785
01:04:22,782 --> 01:04:27,049
Now, I don't have to tell you
that America leads the world...

786
01:04:27,254 --> 01:04:28,584
...in high-grade plastics.

787
01:04:29,055 --> 01:04:30,523
We cannot afford...

788
01:04:30,726 --> 01:04:33,420
...a chemical-plastics gap.

789
01:04:34,663 --> 01:04:35,855
Now, listen to me.

790
01:04:36,629 --> 01:04:38,257
Do you want...

791
01:04:38,466 --> 01:04:42,835
...our president of the United States
sitting down...

792
01:04:43,603 --> 01:04:45,595
...to write a peace treaty...

793
01:04:45,805 --> 01:04:48,672
...and have his ballpoint pen
bust open...

794
01:04:48,875 --> 01:04:52,071
...and the ink run out all over
his nice, clean pants...

795
01:04:52,278 --> 01:04:54,110
...in front of the world leaders?

796
01:04:54,314 --> 01:04:56,145
No. No.

797
01:04:56,649 --> 01:04:58,479
Now, we all know...

798
01:04:58,684 --> 01:05:02,984
...that last week, half of
this great nation of ours...

799
01:05:03,189 --> 01:05:04,816
...almost bit the bullet...

800
01:05:05,424 --> 01:05:07,892
...if it wasn't for this man here.

801
01:05:10,061 --> 01:05:14,431
And all I can say is,
thank the Lord for Superman.

802
01:05:20,405 --> 01:05:22,533
Superman, you saved our bacon...

803
01:05:22,741 --> 01:05:25,038
...and I'd like to show our gratitude.

804
01:05:28,180 --> 01:05:32,549
This is a small token of our
appreciation...

805
01:05:32,751 --> 01:05:37,380
...to show to you for saving us
from a chemical plant disaster.

806
01:05:43,628 --> 01:05:45,323
Thank you very much, general.

807
01:05:45,797 --> 01:05:48,027
This is very nice. Thank you.

808
01:05:59,508 --> 01:06:00,441
It's very nice.

809
01:06:07,850 --> 01:06:11,548
Unknown. How am I supposed to know
what "unknown" means?

810
01:06:11,755 --> 01:06:14,780
It means unknown. It means
nobody knows what it means.

811
01:06:14,990 --> 01:06:17,152
<i>- Hello, boss?
- Gus?</i>

812
01:06:17,661 --> 01:06:20,494
<i>- Gus Gorman here.
- I know that. How did it go?</i>

813
01:06:21,231 --> 01:06:24,792
You know how they're always trying to
find the secret recipe...

814
01:06:25,001 --> 01:06:26,798
...in that chicken in the bucket?

815
01:06:27,002 --> 01:06:29,027
And nobody seems to know
the ingredient...

816
01:06:29,238 --> 01:06:31,400
...because it's unknown, right?

817
01:06:32,073 --> 01:06:36,340
In the Kryptonite there was an unknown
element and Superman didn't die.

818
01:06:37,246 --> 01:06:39,339
He didn't die.

819
01:06:40,015 --> 01:06:42,676
I ask you to kill Superman...

820
01:06:42,884 --> 01:06:47,082
...and you're telling me you couldn't
even do that one simple thing.

821
01:06:51,359 --> 01:06:52,485
Hello?

822
01:07:06,441 --> 01:07:08,965
He hasn't had an afternoon nap
for years.

823
01:07:09,176 --> 01:07:12,839
This is the biggest day of his life.
I don't know how to thank you.

824
01:07:13,046 --> 01:07:14,674
You did with that wonderful lunch.

825
01:07:14,883 --> 01:07:18,046
Oh, well, I do like to cook.

826
01:07:19,086 --> 01:07:21,077
- You'll take some coffee?
- Yes, please.

827
01:07:21,288 --> 01:07:23,415
- Decaffeinated, of course.
- Right.

828
01:07:28,428 --> 01:07:30,894
Hello? Yes.

829
01:07:32,633 --> 01:07:33,964
What?

830
01:07:34,300 --> 01:07:36,166
Oh, really?

831
01:07:36,370 --> 01:07:37,564
Yeah, he's here.

832
01:07:37,771 --> 01:07:39,762
I'll tell him. Okay, thanks.
Bye-bye.

833
01:07:40,907 --> 01:07:42,876
That was my friend Betty.

834
01:07:43,076 --> 01:07:46,568
There's an accident on the bridge.
A trailer crashed through the rail.

835
01:07:46,779 --> 01:07:49,839
It's hanging off the bridge
and the driver's in the cab.

836
01:07:50,382 --> 01:07:52,784
I'm sorry.
I hate to make you rush off.

837
01:07:53,486 --> 01:07:54,747
Well, there's no rush.

838
01:07:55,488 --> 01:07:56,352
But the bridge...

839
01:07:56,555 --> 01:07:59,184
It's okay.
I always get there on time.

840
01:07:59,392 --> 01:08:01,052
Come on, let's relax a little.

841
01:08:14,907 --> 01:08:18,398
It's unusual, finding a good-looking
girl like you alone like this.

842
01:08:29,053 --> 01:08:33,957
Listen, are you sure you shouldn't
do something about the bridge?

843
01:08:34,693 --> 01:08:35,783
What bridge?

844
01:08:41,166 --> 01:08:42,256
You're right.

845
01:08:46,502 --> 01:08:48,232
I have to get going.

846
01:08:57,146 --> 01:08:58,773
Get him out of there. Come on.

847
01:08:58,982 --> 01:09:00,610
Get him out quick!

848
01:09:00,818 --> 01:09:03,547
Get him away. That thing's gonna go.

849
01:09:18,367 --> 01:09:19,859
Everybody okay?

850
01:09:21,169 --> 01:09:22,431
What can I do to help?

851
01:09:22,638 --> 01:09:24,130
Not much of anything now.

852
01:09:24,341 --> 01:09:26,899
If only you'd gotten here
a minute sooner.

853
01:10:42,148 --> 01:10:44,809
"At a special session
of the General Assembly...

854
01:10:45,017 --> 01:10:48,249
...178 countries voted
to censure Superman...

855
01:10:48,454 --> 01:10:50,889
...with only Colombia abstaining."

856
01:10:51,091 --> 01:10:52,556
I can tell you one thing.

857
01:10:52,757 --> 01:10:56,592
He wasn't so mean and nasty
the other day in Smallville.

858
01:10:56,795 --> 01:10:59,229
In fact, he was so full of niceness...

859
01:10:59,431 --> 01:11:01,763
...I hated laying
that big chunk of...

860
01:11:03,501 --> 01:11:04,399
Kryptonite.

861
01:11:04,602 --> 01:11:08,902
Don't you see? That stuff we ran off
in the lab wasn't a failure after all.

862
01:11:09,107 --> 01:11:12,042
Right after Gus gave it to him,
he started to turn into...

863
01:11:12,243 --> 01:11:14,337
...an ornery, evil, malicious,
selfish...

864
01:11:14,546 --> 01:11:16,445
- A normal person.
- Yes.

865
01:11:17,081 --> 01:11:20,609
And now that Superman is out
of the nice-guy business...

866
01:11:20,819 --> 01:11:22,445
We can get to work on that oil.

867
01:11:46,243 --> 01:11:50,373
<i>And now, the supreme moment,
as the last runner...</i>

868
01:11:50,580 --> 01:11:54,481
<i>... the one given the great honor
of lighting the ceremonial flame...</i>

869
01:11:54,684 --> 01:11:58,813
<i>... runs the last leg of a marathon
that began seven days ago...</i>

870
01:11:59,023 --> 01:12:03,756
<i>... as this torch has been passed
from athlete to athlete...</i>

871
01:12:03,960 --> 01:12:06,656
<i>... for 970 miles...</i>

872
01:12:06,863 --> 01:12:08,659
<i>... across the country.</i>

873
01:12:49,871 --> 01:12:53,169
How can he say that pure categories
have no objective meaning...

874
01:12:53,374 --> 01:12:56,171
...in transcendental logic?
What about synthetic unity?

875
01:12:59,079 --> 01:13:00,843
Hi, honey! Am I in your way?

876
01:13:01,049 --> 01:13:02,878
Stick around, you might
learn something.

877
01:13:03,082 --> 01:13:03,947
Hi, Lorelei.

878
01:13:04,185 --> 01:13:07,779
All the oil tankers in the world
are controlled by computers.

879
01:13:07,989 --> 01:13:10,855
They tell them where to go,
how much oil to pick up...

880
01:13:11,058 --> 01:13:12,753
...and where to deliver it.

881
01:13:13,025 --> 01:13:14,789
Don't they have captains
on these ships?

882
01:13:14,996 --> 01:13:16,360
Yes, but they don't need to.

883
01:13:16,563 --> 01:13:19,862
That's a throwback to some
sentimental, seafaring baloney.

884
01:13:20,067 --> 01:13:23,798
You will command the tankers to sail
toward a 50-mile area...

885
01:13:24,004 --> 01:13:25,767
...in the middle of
the Atlantic Ocean.

886
01:13:25,973 --> 01:13:27,634
And do what?

887
01:13:27,841 --> 01:13:30,036
And do nothing.

888
01:13:30,244 --> 01:13:32,437
Just sit there.

889
01:13:33,646 --> 01:13:36,546
How are all the people
gonna get their oil?

890
01:13:37,717 --> 01:13:40,082
You catch on fast, old buddy.

891
01:13:42,855 --> 01:13:46,017
Every oil pump in America is run by...

892
01:13:46,224 --> 01:13:48,954
- Computers. I know.
- Will you stop interrupting?!

893
01:13:49,161 --> 01:13:50,321
I'm sorry.

894
01:13:50,662 --> 01:13:54,428
You will command the pumps
to stop pumping.

895
01:13:54,633 --> 01:13:58,569
Then I want you to program
one special command...

896
01:13:58,770 --> 01:14:00,829
...into all these systems.

897
01:14:01,038 --> 01:14:03,803
Tell them these orders
are irreversible.

898
01:14:04,009 --> 01:14:07,774
So it would be impossible
for anybody to switch them back.

899
01:14:07,978 --> 01:14:09,810
Can you do this for me, old buddy?

900
01:14:10,414 --> 01:14:12,245
Old pal?

901
01:14:19,623 --> 01:14:22,023
You know, you get your way
all the time.

902
01:14:23,227 --> 01:14:24,990
And it's not right.

903
01:14:27,431 --> 01:14:29,523
I want to know when I get a taste.

904
01:14:36,006 --> 01:14:40,271
I think you've already had
a taste of freedom, haven't you?

905
01:14:40,475 --> 01:14:43,002
Or would you prefer jail?

906
01:14:43,213 --> 01:14:45,042
You can't run that jail number on me.

907
01:14:45,416 --> 01:14:48,976
Because I know I mean more to you
out here doing things for you...

908
01:14:49,185 --> 01:14:51,848
...than sitting in jail
doing nothing for nobody.

909
01:14:53,689 --> 01:14:54,622
I see.

910
01:14:54,824 --> 01:14:56,724
What do you want?

911
01:15:03,065 --> 01:15:05,534
What? A waste basket?

912
01:15:05,735 --> 01:15:07,827
No. These are plans.

913
01:15:08,737 --> 01:15:10,227
Blueprints.

914
01:15:10,807 --> 01:15:12,830
- For what?
- A computer.

915
01:15:13,040 --> 01:15:15,839
- We've already got computers.
- No, not like this.

916
01:15:16,044 --> 01:15:19,535
There's not a computer like this
in the whole world, anyplace.

917
01:15:20,148 --> 01:15:21,981
It doesn't exist.
You see...

918
01:15:22,316 --> 01:15:23,578
...we have to build it.

919
01:15:24,152 --> 01:15:25,177
What will it do?

920
01:15:25,554 --> 01:15:27,384
Anything I tell it.

921
01:15:27,955 --> 01:15:30,082
What will it do for me?

922
01:15:30,291 --> 01:15:34,523
For you? It will do anything you
tell me to tell it to do for you.

923
01:15:40,969 --> 01:15:42,525
Tell me.

924
01:15:44,439 --> 01:15:47,737
First of all, if anyone attacks
this machine or anything...

925
01:15:47,943 --> 01:15:49,841
...the computer counterattacks it.

926
01:15:50,044 --> 01:15:53,035
It finds their witnesses
and wipes them out.

927
01:15:53,613 --> 01:15:54,639
<i>Right, old buddy.</i>

928
01:15:54,849 --> 01:15:58,614
<i>You deal with my oil
and I'll build you your machine.</i>

929
01:16:02,288 --> 01:16:03,950
<i>Okay, I'll do it.</i>

930
01:16:04,158 --> 01:16:07,685
<i>But I'm not so sure about
this irreversible business.</i>

931
01:16:24,843 --> 01:16:27,505
They all kind of went...
What the hell?

932
01:16:30,915 --> 01:16:33,385
That's it. The last tanker.

933
01:16:34,120 --> 01:16:36,986
They're all mine now.
All mine.

934
01:16:39,257 --> 01:16:41,488
Not quite.

935
01:16:41,694 --> 01:16:44,161
What's that in
the upper-middle quadrant?

936
01:16:45,197 --> 01:16:46,664
It's a tanker.

937
01:16:48,802 --> 01:16:50,768
And it's going the wrong way.

938
01:17:01,512 --> 01:17:02,672
Skipper?

939
01:17:02,881 --> 01:17:05,541
There it is again.
"Proceed immediately to...

940
01:17:05,750 --> 01:17:08,776
...latitude 30 north,
longitude 45 west.

941
01:17:10,555 --> 01:17:12,183
There await further orders."

942
01:17:12,391 --> 01:17:14,517
Hell, that's the middle
of the Atlantic.

943
01:17:14,726 --> 01:17:17,627
I'm not taking my ship there
to "await further orders"...

944
01:17:17,828 --> 01:17:19,386
...no matter what that says.

945
01:17:19,596 --> 01:17:23,191
We're supposed to go to Metropolis,
and we're going to Metropolis.

946
01:17:23,400 --> 01:17:24,628
All right.

947
01:17:37,047 --> 01:17:38,344
That's where she is.

948
01:17:38,548 --> 01:17:40,607
Come on, get it up there.

949
01:17:42,051 --> 01:17:43,041
<i>Miss?</i>

950
01:17:43,986 --> 01:17:46,217
<i>Miss, can you hear me?</i>

951
01:17:46,423 --> 01:17:49,084
<i>Listen, we are here to help you.</i>

952
01:17:49,291 --> 01:17:52,748
<i>Don't jump. I repeat, do not jump!</i>

953
01:17:54,364 --> 01:17:55,762
Thought you'd never come.

954
01:17:56,631 --> 01:17:59,361
Don't expect me to save you.
I don't do that anymore.

955
01:17:59,567 --> 01:18:00,627
Don't worry.

956
01:18:00,837 --> 01:18:03,531
I'm long past saving.

957
01:18:10,646 --> 01:18:12,408
Don't let me keep you from anything.

958
01:18:13,082 --> 01:18:14,639
I'm not in a rush.

959
01:18:20,522 --> 01:18:22,490
What did you have in mind?

960
01:18:22,857 --> 01:18:24,382
Lots of things.

961
01:18:24,592 --> 01:18:25,889
Oh, yeah?

962
01:18:28,996 --> 01:18:31,897
If you'll just do me
one little favor first.

963
01:18:32,100 --> 01:18:33,465
What's that?

964
01:18:36,236 --> 01:18:38,467
See, there's this little boat...

965
01:18:38,673 --> 01:18:42,335
...and it's not going where
it's supposed to go and...

966
01:19:19,010 --> 01:19:20,638
Stop all engines!

967
01:19:21,647 --> 01:19:23,340
Stop all engines!

968
01:20:16,699 --> 01:20:18,225
Hi.

969
01:20:33,784 --> 01:20:36,183
How about a little après-ski?

970
01:20:47,163 --> 01:20:48,562
Champagne?

971
01:21:12,322 --> 01:21:14,151
Take your turn like everybody else!

972
01:21:14,355 --> 01:21:16,415
Stop it!

973
01:21:19,160 --> 01:21:21,185
He's coming over here, Martha.

974
01:21:24,764 --> 01:21:26,164
Don't you do that!

975
01:21:36,043 --> 01:21:38,012
Hit him with your handbag!

976
01:21:41,582 --> 01:21:44,915
Help me! Please, help me.
Somebody's beating up my husband.

977
01:21:45,119 --> 01:21:48,714
- I've gotta call the police.
- Jack, go with her, okay?

978
01:21:49,789 --> 01:21:52,281
The third one today,
and at night it's worse.

979
01:21:52,493 --> 01:21:54,289
Somebody's behind this.

980
01:21:54,493 --> 01:21:56,291
You can't say there's no oil.

981
01:21:56,496 --> 01:21:58,793
You can't say someone's
not getting rich off this.

982
01:21:58,998 --> 01:22:00,830
Someone's always getting rich.

983
01:22:01,034 --> 01:22:03,024
You know who suffers?
The small guy.

984
01:22:03,235 --> 01:22:06,467
<i>The east coast gets the brunt
of the spill.</i>

985
01:22:49,180 --> 01:22:51,704
No, I cannot go out with you tonight.

986
01:22:52,149 --> 01:22:53,675
I'm busy tomorrow night too.

987
01:22:53,886 --> 01:22:55,647
Oh, yeah? Doing what?

988
01:22:56,086 --> 01:22:57,918
I'll think of something. Look...

989
01:22:58,122 --> 01:23:00,750
...I gotta go. Ricky needs me.

990
01:23:01,458 --> 01:23:04,587
Brad, please stop calling me.
I've told you!

991
01:23:04,796 --> 01:23:06,820
Well, you listen to me, huh?

992
01:23:07,030 --> 01:23:08,999
You better start appreciating
ol' Brad.

993
01:23:09,434 --> 01:23:10,956
What else you got in Smallville?

994
01:23:16,907 --> 01:23:19,432
What else have I got in Smallville?

995
01:23:20,976 --> 01:23:22,968
I think I got the right answer.

996
01:23:23,648 --> 01:23:25,045
So do I.

997
01:23:34,122 --> 01:23:37,820
Smallville Airport, what flights
do you have to Metropolis tomorrow?

998
01:23:43,465 --> 01:23:45,991
- Where do I put this?
- Over there.

999
01:23:47,704 --> 01:23:50,762
- Where do you want this?
- Load it up there.

1000
01:24:28,775 --> 01:24:29,935
Just leave him alone.

1001
01:24:51,696 --> 01:24:53,824
I can't get through.
Something's happening.

1002
01:24:54,033 --> 01:24:55,829
Hey, look! Superman's drunk!

1003
01:24:56,034 --> 01:24:58,195
I want to see what's happening here.

1004
01:25:03,309 --> 01:25:05,435
- Thank you.
- It's a disgrace, that's what.

1005
01:25:05,644 --> 01:25:08,443
Nobody's ever gonna trust
that creep again.

1006
01:25:08,647 --> 01:25:10,081
He's washed up.

1007
01:25:13,585 --> 01:25:16,281
What are you looking at? Huh?

1008
01:25:16,688 --> 01:25:19,886
Excuse me. Superman?
It's me, Ricky.

1009
01:25:20,090 --> 01:25:21,752
Ricky from Smallville.

1010
01:25:21,993 --> 01:25:23,722
Tell them you won't hurt anybody!

1011
01:25:23,929 --> 01:25:25,088
He's changed.

1012
01:25:25,296 --> 01:25:27,924
No! Maybe he's just sick.

1013
01:25:28,132 --> 01:25:29,998
Superman, please get better!

1014
01:25:30,202 --> 01:25:31,634
He's not listening to you.

1015
01:25:31,835 --> 01:25:35,635
Yes, he is. He can hear me.
He's got super-hearing.

1016
01:25:35,839 --> 01:25:38,434
Superman, you're just in a slump!

1017
01:25:38,643 --> 01:25:40,371
You'll be great again!

1018
01:25:40,578 --> 01:25:42,069
You can do it, Superman!

1019
01:25:42,280 --> 01:25:45,248
<i>Superman, you can hear me, can't you?</i>

1020
01:25:45,449 --> 01:25:48,009
<i>Superman, you're just in a slump.</i>

1021
01:25:48,219 --> 01:25:51,780
<i>You'll be great again.
You can do it, Superman.</i>

1022
01:26:15,211 --> 01:26:16,200
He's gone nuts!

1023
01:26:18,146 --> 01:26:19,136
Come on!

1024
01:27:46,098 --> 01:27:48,067
I can give as good as I get.

1025
01:27:49,201 --> 01:27:52,193
Yeah? All right, come on!
Come on!

1026
01:27:52,404 --> 01:27:54,100
Come on! Come on!

1027
01:28:19,598 --> 01:28:22,226
What's the matter, Kent?
Too warm for you, huh?

1028
01:28:24,369 --> 01:28:27,133
Come on, chicken! Come and get me.

1029
01:28:27,338 --> 01:28:29,601
You've been on my nerves
a long time!

1030
01:28:51,496 --> 01:28:53,587
You always wanted to fly, Kent.

1031
01:28:53,796 --> 01:28:55,025
Now's your chance.

1032
01:33:49,114 --> 01:33:50,103
Skipper!

1033
01:34:05,263 --> 01:34:07,664
God, would you look at that!

1034
01:34:55,077 --> 01:34:57,706
<i>Miss Lorelei Ambrosia
isn't at home right now.</i>

1035
01:34:57,914 --> 01:35:00,107
<i>But if you'd care
to leave a message...</i>

1036
01:35:00,316 --> 01:35:02,648
<i>... why not deliver it to her...</i>

1037
01:35:02,852 --> 01:35:03,681
<i>... in person?</i>

1038
01:35:03,886 --> 01:35:07,252
<i>So you've finally shown
your true colors.</i>

1039
01:35:07,455 --> 01:35:11,722
<i>Well, if you're looking for us,
here's where you'll find us.</i>

1040
01:35:11,927 --> 01:35:13,621
<i>Do drop in.</i>

1041
01:35:20,235 --> 01:35:21,862
This is fun!

1042
01:35:22,304 --> 01:35:24,328
Fun? The fun's just starting.

1043
01:35:24,939 --> 01:35:27,772
Wait till Superman finds us,
then you'll see some fun.

1044
01:35:27,976 --> 01:35:30,342
Wait, you gonna mess with Superman?

1045
01:35:30,645 --> 01:35:34,638
Let's go. I want to be ready for him
when he falls into our trap.

1046
01:35:34,949 --> 01:35:38,783
I just don't see why you can't
balloon down like the rest of us.

1047
01:35:38,986 --> 01:35:40,079
Well...

1048
01:35:41,922 --> 01:35:43,014
No way. Uh-uh.

1049
01:35:43,223 --> 01:35:45,714
I just don't believe a man can fly.

1050
01:36:02,910 --> 01:36:04,901
Watch out, horsy!

1051
01:36:14,654 --> 01:36:16,747
Don't, don't, don't.

1052
01:36:16,957 --> 01:36:19,356
Just don't try to fly.

1053
01:36:19,625 --> 01:36:21,058
Don't try to fly!

1054
01:36:34,307 --> 01:36:36,741
Will you get out of my way!

1055
01:36:55,559 --> 01:36:57,891
- Hurry! Hurry up!
- I am hurrying.

1056
01:37:03,469 --> 01:37:05,765
- I can't see anything.
- Turn on the light.

1057
01:37:05,970 --> 01:37:08,699
- Where's the light switch?
- Where do you usually find it?

1058
01:37:08,906 --> 01:37:11,205
I don't know.
I guess I'll check the doorway.

1059
01:37:11,409 --> 01:37:15,277
God, it's pitch-black in here.
Oh, that's better.

1060
01:37:18,749 --> 01:37:21,479
Wow, what a jukebox!

1061
01:37:21,685 --> 01:37:23,617
I told you, didn't I?

1062
01:37:23,819 --> 01:37:26,086
There. The ultimate computer!

1063
01:37:33,263 --> 01:37:37,030
It does everything a computer can do
and 1000 things none of them can!

1064
01:37:37,234 --> 01:37:38,631
Let's give it a dry run.

1065
01:37:38,834 --> 01:37:40,769
Wait. We've gotta wait for Gus.

1066
01:37:40,970 --> 01:37:42,267
Who needs Gus?

1067
01:37:42,471 --> 01:37:45,805
- Only he can operate it.
- Like fish, he is!

1068
01:37:46,008 --> 01:37:49,239
I know enough about computers
to put a Ph.D. To shame.

1069
01:37:49,444 --> 01:37:52,006
Come now, brother dear,
you didn't think...

1070
01:37:52,215 --> 01:37:54,877
...I'd let that little man
run the show, did you?

1071
01:37:55,251 --> 01:37:57,275
Why don't peons tidy up
when they're done?

1072
01:37:57,486 --> 01:38:00,284
Come on, Bubba, it's showtime.

1073
01:38:03,725 --> 01:38:06,387
Engage those buttons to
activate the alpha circuit...

1074
01:38:06,594 --> 01:38:07,960
...and lock the modular grid.

1075
01:38:08,163 --> 01:38:13,065
You! Activate circuits
29 through W-7...

1076
01:38:13,267 --> 01:38:17,328
...and start full-power coordinates
on exterior defensive systems.

1077
01:38:17,538 --> 01:38:20,440
In other words, push this red button.

1078
01:38:21,275 --> 01:38:23,267
How did you know about that?

1079
01:38:41,227 --> 01:38:42,217
He's here!

1080
01:38:42,430 --> 01:38:44,489
Let's give him
something to worry about.

1081
01:38:46,500 --> 01:38:47,965
Now, let's see...

1082
01:38:48,402 --> 01:38:50,801
Tracking systems locked.

1083
01:39:16,296 --> 01:39:18,286
Let the games begin.

1084
01:39:19,298 --> 01:39:20,891
Don't tense up now, honey.

1085
01:39:53,431 --> 01:39:56,297
Come on, Bubba,
you're wasting your rockets.

1086
01:40:03,740 --> 01:40:05,833
Come on, Superman!

1087
01:40:06,910 --> 01:40:08,776
Let him have it, Ross.

1088
01:40:15,652 --> 01:40:17,483
Bubba, keep firing.

1089
01:40:17,687 --> 01:40:20,315
Keep him occupied
while I get the MX ready.

1090
01:40:47,584 --> 01:40:49,778
What the hell is going on?

1091
01:40:57,859 --> 01:41:01,555
Keep your rockets coming. He won't
notice the missile till too late!

1092
01:41:09,737 --> 01:41:11,897
So much for your catlike reflexes.

1093
01:41:22,383 --> 01:41:23,212
Oh, God!

1094
01:41:33,926 --> 01:41:36,862
No more. Look, you sit.

1095
01:41:37,064 --> 01:41:38,861
Sit, sit!

1096
01:41:42,569 --> 01:41:43,694
Help!

1097
01:41:44,437 --> 01:41:45,269
Hello!

1098
01:41:45,772 --> 01:41:47,603
Get to, jackass!

1099
01:41:48,841 --> 01:41:50,138
That's him out of the way.

1100
01:41:50,343 --> 01:41:54,439
Sis, how would you like to control
all the world's weapons systems?

1101
01:41:55,314 --> 01:41:56,509
Baby!

1102
01:41:56,717 --> 01:41:58,182
It's Daddy!

1103
01:41:59,252 --> 01:42:01,447
Hey, what are you doing with my baby?

1104
01:42:01,888 --> 01:42:06,052
Gus, old buddy, genius.
Come up and join the fun.

1105
01:42:16,968 --> 01:42:20,529
He's still coming.
Arm the inner defenses.

1106
01:42:24,976 --> 01:42:26,467
All right, the game's over.

1107
01:42:27,145 --> 01:42:28,133
Hi, honey.

1108
01:42:28,714 --> 01:42:29,873
I don't know you, lady.

1109
01:42:31,916 --> 01:42:33,145
But the other night...

1110
01:42:35,753 --> 01:42:37,949
I'm sorry, but that wasn't me.

1111
01:42:38,156 --> 01:42:39,487
That guy's gone.

1112
01:42:41,259 --> 01:42:42,725
And you're next, Webster.

1113
01:42:43,862 --> 01:42:47,262
Never underestimate
the power of computers.

1114
01:42:47,565 --> 01:42:48,896
How do you like it?

1115
01:42:49,099 --> 01:42:51,623
I think it's typical
of people like you, Webster.

1116
01:42:51,935 --> 01:42:55,303
Instead of helping others,
you four just help yourselves.

1117
01:42:55,506 --> 01:42:56,666
Four...

1118
01:42:56,874 --> 01:42:57,807
...of you?

1119
01:42:58,009 --> 01:43:00,101
You mean, us? Four? Wait...

1120
01:43:00,311 --> 01:43:01,971
Hey, man!

1121
01:43:02,178 --> 01:43:05,841
That's only his last name.
He likes to be called "Superman."

1122
01:43:06,616 --> 01:43:09,245
See, I'm not with them, Superman.

1123
01:43:09,853 --> 01:43:11,250
You could've fooled me.

1124
01:43:19,597 --> 01:43:21,085
That's very good.

1125
01:43:23,567 --> 01:43:27,059
Let's see how long
he can carry on without any air.

1126
01:43:49,191 --> 01:43:51,159
He's still coming!
He's going to get me!

1127
01:43:51,359 --> 01:43:52,452
Don't bet on it!

1128
01:44:05,139 --> 01:44:06,505
You're hurting him.

1129
01:44:10,611 --> 01:44:12,671
- That's Kryptonite!
- Yes.

1130
01:44:12,881 --> 01:44:15,405
- This time we got it right!
- You're a genius.

1131
01:44:15,950 --> 01:44:19,510
You've invented a machine
that can find anybody's weak spot.

1132
01:44:20,053 --> 01:44:21,545
Congratulations, old buddy.

1133
01:44:21,757 --> 01:44:24,987
You'll go down in history
as the man who killed Superman!

1134
01:44:25,193 --> 01:44:26,419
I'm... No.

1135
01:44:27,127 --> 01:44:28,425
Superman!

1136
01:44:28,629 --> 01:44:29,492
No!

1137
01:44:30,797 --> 01:44:32,992
- Where do you think you're going?
- Never mind.

1138
01:44:33,198 --> 01:44:36,067
- Turn the power up.
- Don't you think he's had enough?

1139
01:44:39,906 --> 01:44:41,203
Turn it up!

1140
01:44:41,408 --> 01:44:43,501
Power! More power!

1141
01:45:04,931 --> 01:45:07,625
Seventy-five. Current 7.75.

1142
01:45:11,703 --> 01:45:16,470
There's a current level of 7
that is not supposed to be on bar...

1143
01:45:16,674 --> 01:45:18,232
Oh, here it is!

1144
01:45:45,002 --> 01:45:45,933
What's going on?

1145
01:45:46,803 --> 01:45:48,635
I don't know. The power's gone.

1146
01:45:49,107 --> 01:45:51,005
Gus must have pulled the plug out.

1147
01:45:51,476 --> 01:45:52,943
It worked.

1148
01:45:53,143 --> 01:45:55,475
It worked! I got it!

1149
01:45:59,516 --> 01:46:00,982
What have you got?

1150
01:46:03,488 --> 01:46:05,249
- Give me that screw.
- This screw?

1151
01:46:05,454 --> 01:46:07,582
- That screw.
- Never!

1152
01:46:37,086 --> 01:46:38,178
What?

1153
01:46:41,022 --> 01:46:42,490
Holy!

1154
01:46:43,056 --> 01:46:45,218
No! Make it stop!

1155
01:46:46,828 --> 01:46:48,295
I can't! It's out of control!

1156
01:46:48,496 --> 01:46:51,659
But how?
Where's it getting the power from?

1157
01:46:55,236 --> 01:46:57,431
It's feeding itself.

1158
01:46:57,639 --> 01:46:58,900
It wants to live!

1159
01:47:21,794 --> 01:47:23,956
It's this thing here.
We'll go to the zoo.

1160
01:47:24,164 --> 01:47:27,429
I'll do that tomorrow,
and then we'll go on to the...

1161
01:47:28,533 --> 01:47:31,060
- What's happening?
- It's okay, Ricky.

1162
01:47:31,338 --> 01:47:32,497
Put the lights on!

1163
01:47:52,458 --> 01:47:54,483
Stop it! You're killing him!

1164
01:47:56,294 --> 01:47:57,659
Stop it!

1165
01:48:10,109 --> 01:48:11,540
Hey. Put me down!

1166
01:48:28,792 --> 01:48:31,887
Don't leave us alone
in here! Superman!

1167
01:48:36,401 --> 01:48:37,229
Oh, I get it.

1168
01:48:37,433 --> 01:48:41,097
The coaxial energy shaft is engaging
the grid source factor. Right.

1169
01:48:41,305 --> 01:48:43,135
We're through, pugface.
I'm splitting.

1170
01:48:43,339 --> 01:48:44,898
Hey, wait a minute!

1171
01:48:47,444 --> 01:48:50,105
Girls. Girls, come out of there!

1172
01:49:08,665 --> 01:49:09,790
Sis?

1173
01:49:13,636 --> 01:49:14,933
Oh, my God.

1174
01:49:22,543 --> 01:49:23,806
What is that?

1175
01:49:39,227 --> 01:49:41,354
Sis, it's your Bubba!

1176
01:50:19,467 --> 01:50:21,092
Help me. Help!

1177
01:50:23,304 --> 01:50:24,599
Superman!

1178
01:50:27,740 --> 01:50:28,730
Honey!

1179
01:50:28,942 --> 01:50:32,810
Honey, I'm stuck here! Help!
What about me?

1180
01:50:44,023 --> 01:50:45,012
Look out!

1181
01:52:54,314 --> 01:52:55,509
Bubba?

1182
01:53:41,860 --> 01:53:43,589
Thank you, brother.

1183
01:53:50,635 --> 01:53:52,330
Regular or premium?

1184
01:53:52,537 --> 01:53:56,632
She hasn't had a drink in so long,
give her a tankful of the good stuff.

1185
01:53:58,609 --> 01:53:59,542
How you doing?

1186
01:53:59,745 --> 01:54:02,837
Please don't talk to me.
I'm having enough trouble hanging on.

1187
01:54:03,048 --> 01:54:05,811
Okay, we'll go slow.
You're perfectly safe.

1188
01:54:06,417 --> 01:54:07,817
I won't argue with you.

1189
01:54:08,018 --> 01:54:11,113
Any man who can trick my machine
can do anything.

1190
01:54:11,323 --> 01:54:13,017
How did you beat my defenses?

1191
01:54:13,224 --> 01:54:16,624
Those defenses are good as long as
it didn't know it's in trouble.

1192
01:54:16,860 --> 01:54:20,353
This time it didn't see the danger.
I went in with plain old acid.

1193
01:54:20,563 --> 01:54:24,193
It didn't know that when acid gets hot,
it'll eat through anything.

1194
01:54:24,735 --> 01:54:26,327
Watch the trees.

1195
01:54:26,904 --> 01:54:29,965
I guess it died of acid indigestion.

1196
01:54:31,240 --> 01:54:33,802
But what's gonna happen
to Ross and the ladies?

1197
01:54:34,011 --> 01:54:37,538
They'll have to see the police.
It's not your problem anymore.

1198
01:54:39,083 --> 01:54:40,606
Are we in Metropolis yet?

1199
01:54:40,817 --> 01:54:43,912
Nope. I'm just gonna make
a little stop. Right over there.

1200
01:54:51,594 --> 01:54:53,255
We're on the ground, Gus.

1201
01:54:54,296 --> 01:54:56,288
- You okay, Supe?
- I'm fine.

1202
01:54:56,499 --> 01:54:57,658
Excuse me.

1203
01:55:02,037 --> 01:55:03,799
Can you guys spare one of these?

1204
01:55:04,707 --> 01:55:07,402
- Sure, Superman.
- It is Superman, isn't it?

1205
01:55:07,609 --> 01:55:09,600
Are you kidding? Is that?

1206
01:55:09,811 --> 01:55:12,542
Didn't you see us fly out of the sky?

1207
01:55:13,748 --> 01:55:18,310
We're the only two men who can fly.
"Is it Superman?"

1208
01:55:18,519 --> 01:55:19,350
Just right.

1209
01:55:20,888 --> 01:55:21,913
Okay, let's go.

1210
01:55:22,124 --> 01:55:25,183
I was afraid you'd say that.
I thought I'd take the bus.

1211
01:55:25,693 --> 01:55:29,026
Well, suit yourself.
Does your boss have a computer here?

1212
01:55:29,397 --> 01:55:32,298
Yeah, he got a little bitty one
about that big.

1213
01:55:32,500 --> 01:55:36,128
You tell him he can do a lot worse
than to give Gus Gorman here a job.

1214
01:55:38,372 --> 01:55:39,963
Wow, thank you, Supe.

1215
01:55:40,407 --> 01:55:41,341
Take care.

1216
01:55:43,242 --> 01:55:44,734
I'll see you around.

1217
01:55:50,817 --> 01:55:51,910
So long.

1218
01:55:54,955 --> 01:55:56,651
Take it easy, man.

1219
01:55:58,024 --> 01:56:02,255
Well, you got good references,
so if you want that job...

1220
01:56:06,299 --> 01:56:09,062
Nah, this is not for me.
I think I'll take that bus.

1221
01:56:09,269 --> 01:56:11,169
Where's the bus station?

1222
01:56:11,370 --> 01:56:13,965
Yeah, about 9, 10 miles
over there.

1223
01:56:14,174 --> 01:56:16,699
Nine or 10 miles.

1224
01:56:18,811 --> 01:56:20,872
Hey. You really flew with him?

1225
01:56:21,081 --> 01:56:24,107
Superman?
Have you ever seen Superman before?

1226
01:56:27,453 --> 01:56:30,911
Oh, you don't know about me and him?
Me and Superman?

1227
01:56:36,095 --> 01:56:38,427
Yeah, we go way back together.

1228
01:56:38,630 --> 01:56:41,290
We always, usually, sometimes, we...

1229
01:56:42,735 --> 01:56:44,497
Nine or 10 miles?

1230
01:56:45,035 --> 01:56:46,971
I think I'll walk.

1231
01:56:47,339 --> 01:56:48,737
Yeah, I'll walk.

1232
01:56:55,579 --> 01:56:56,809
Clark.

1233
01:56:57,149 --> 01:57:00,140
What a nice surprise! Come in.

1234
01:57:00,351 --> 01:57:01,545
Hi, Mr. Kent.

1235
01:57:02,120 --> 01:57:04,553
- Guess who Mom's having dinner with?
- Who?

1236
01:57:04,755 --> 01:57:06,121
Superman!

1237
01:57:06,691 --> 01:57:08,886
Yeah, that's what I came to tell you.

1238
01:57:09,093 --> 01:57:10,992
Superman said to tell you he's sorry...

1239
01:57:11,194 --> 01:57:14,755
...but he's run into a problem
and he can't make dinner with you.

1240
01:57:14,965 --> 01:57:17,331
I guess he misses a lot of dinners.

1241
01:57:18,503 --> 01:57:20,366
Would you mind settling for me?

1242
01:57:20,570 --> 01:57:21,833
Any day.

1243
01:57:22,774 --> 01:57:24,000
I'll get my things.

1244
01:57:25,942 --> 01:57:29,435
Lana, I was talking
to Superman the other day.

1245
01:57:29,647 --> 01:57:33,411
You know, he and I, we talk a lot.

1246
01:57:33,916 --> 01:57:37,250
He felt badly about you having
to pawn your diamond ring.

1247
01:57:40,357 --> 01:57:41,823
Well, he found...

1248
01:57:43,058 --> 01:57:46,255
He found this one just lying around.

1249
01:57:47,564 --> 01:57:49,996
He wanted you to have this.

1250
01:57:56,871 --> 01:57:58,806
Wow, a ring from Superman!

1251
01:57:59,975 --> 01:58:02,103
- It's okay. I got it.
- Sorry.

1252
01:58:04,212 --> 01:58:06,545
- Oh, Clark.
- It's okay.

1253
01:58:06,749 --> 01:58:08,009
It fits.

1254
01:58:08,550 --> 01:58:09,881
It looks really pretty.

1255
01:58:10,085 --> 01:58:11,144
Thank you.

1256
01:58:14,289 --> 01:58:15,347
Brad.

1257
01:58:15,823 --> 01:58:16,848
Son of a bitch.

1258
01:58:18,693 --> 01:58:20,627
Kent, I hate you.

1259
01:58:21,563 --> 01:58:23,463
I've always hated you.

1260
01:58:23,998 --> 01:58:25,795
- You know why?
- No.

1261
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:27,558
- Because you're nice.
- Not really.

1262
01:58:27,769 --> 01:58:29,235
And nice guys finish last.

1263
01:58:41,014 --> 01:58:42,641
Lois, I've got to hand it to you.

1264
01:58:42,850 --> 01:58:45,251
Who else could turn
a vacation into a story...

1265
01:58:45,453 --> 01:58:48,420
...that'll blow the lid off
of corruption in the Caribbean?

1266
01:58:48,622 --> 01:58:51,920
I knew I was onto something
when that taxi driver kidnapped me.

1267
01:58:52,125 --> 01:58:54,117
Lois, you're terrific.

1268
01:58:54,328 --> 01:58:58,161
I have to be.
Seems I've got some new competition.

1269
01:58:59,633 --> 01:59:02,157
The story that you wrote
on the class reunion?

1270
01:59:02,368 --> 01:59:04,166
- I thought it was terrific.
- Thanks.

1271
01:59:04,371 --> 01:59:07,965
And fascinating. I liked the part
about the little girl back home.

1272
01:59:08,174 --> 01:59:10,404
I'll take you to lunch
and you tell me about it.

1273
01:59:11,277 --> 01:59:14,541
I'd love to, but I'm having lunch
with Mr. White's new secretary.

1274
01:59:14,746 --> 01:59:15,736
- Hi, Lana.
- Hi, Clark.

1275
01:59:15,948 --> 01:59:20,247
Lois, say hello to Lana Lang.
Smallville's newest gift to Metropolis.

1276
01:59:20,452 --> 01:59:22,887
Glad to meet you.
I like your writing a lot.

1277
01:59:23,256 --> 01:59:24,346
Thank you.

1278
01:59:25,323 --> 01:59:26,655
I like your sparkler a lot.

1279
01:59:26,859 --> 01:59:29,793
Me too. I couldn't believe it
when Clark gave it to me.

1280
01:59:31,263 --> 01:59:32,993
Clark gave it to you?

1281
01:59:36,134 --> 01:59:37,499
Mr. White.

1282
01:59:37,702 --> 01:59:40,829
Mr. White, look what I've got for you.

1283
01:59:41,039 --> 01:59:43,939
People, I am in love
with this machine!

1284
01:59:44,141 --> 01:59:48,737
Excuse me, but I have a couple
of errands to run before lunch.

1285
01:59:48,946 --> 01:59:51,676
- Go ahead, Mr. White.
- Where's the handle?

1286
01:59:51,883 --> 01:59:55,147
There is no handle.
You just push the button.

1287
02:00:50,257 --> 02:00:53,092
Giorgio, por favore?

1288
02:00:53,300 --> 02:00:55,344
Grazie.
