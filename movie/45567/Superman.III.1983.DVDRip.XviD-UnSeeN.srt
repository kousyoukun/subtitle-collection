1
00:00:17,909 --> 00:00:19,399
<i>Next, please.</i>

2
00:00:20,044 --> 00:00:21,341
Come on, come on.

3
00:00:21,813 --> 00:00:23,041
Next.

4
00:00:23,348 --> 00:00:24,406
Name.

5
00:00:24,716 --> 00:00:26,343
Gus Gorman.

6
00:00:34,192 --> 00:00:36,524
Ah, yes. August Gorman.

7
00:00:36,728 --> 00:00:38,958
Have you looked for work this week?

8
00:00:39,197 --> 00:00:41,893
- Yes.
- What kind?

9
00:00:44,135 --> 00:00:47,070
- Kitchen technician.
- Dishwasher. Any luck?

10
00:00:47,906 --> 00:00:48,873
No, but...

11
00:00:49,073 --> 00:00:52,804
According to our records,
you have been unemployed for 36 weeks.

12
00:00:53,011 --> 00:00:54,137
No, it's 35.

13
00:00:54,345 --> 00:00:56,245
Not counting this week.

14
00:00:56,447 --> 00:01:00,816
You secured employment in June as a
messenger and were discharged after...

15
00:01:01,019 --> 00:01:03,783
...one day for...
- No, they said I lost it.

16
00:01:03,988 --> 00:01:07,082
I did not lose it!
It was stolen by a pickpocket.

17
00:01:07,292 --> 00:01:08,657
A television set?

18
00:01:08,893 --> 00:01:12,522
It was a teeny tiny, teeny weensy
Japanese television set.

19
00:01:12,764 --> 00:01:17,667
The other employment you found was
in a fast-food joint, which lasted...

20
00:01:17,869 --> 00:01:19,200
...28 minutes?

21
00:01:19,771 --> 00:01:22,103
That's some kind of record.
Talk about fast.

22
00:01:22,307 --> 00:01:26,801
Those people are crazy. They expect
you to learn that stuff in one day.

23
00:01:27,011 --> 00:01:30,970
"Hold the lettuce. Hold the ketchup.
Can I have some sauce, please?"

24
00:01:31,182 --> 00:01:33,707
- Mr. Gorman...
- "Two buns. No buns. Some cheese."

25
00:01:34,118 --> 00:01:37,417
Mr. Gorman, the city of Metropolis
is generous to a fault but...

26
00:01:37,822 --> 00:01:40,916
- I'm not the fault!
- 36 weeks of chronic unemployment.

27
00:01:41,125 --> 00:01:44,219
36 weeks of living off the taxes
of hard-working citizens.

28
00:01:44,429 --> 00:01:47,694
- You know what you are?
- Don't call me a bum, I'm not a bum!

29
00:01:48,666 --> 00:01:53,535
You are, I was about to say,
no longer eligible.

30
00:01:54,172 --> 00:01:55,571
- Well, look...
- Next.

31
00:01:55,773 --> 00:01:57,866
What about this week?
I need this week!

32
00:01:58,376 --> 00:01:59,308
Next.

33
00:01:59,677 --> 00:02:01,269
You mean, that's it?

34
00:02:01,612 --> 00:02:03,477
"Finished," like "over"?

35
00:02:07,352 --> 00:02:08,478
Next.

36
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:10,949
"Next" as in "bye."

37
00:02:11,723 --> 00:02:12,951
Next!

38
00:02:15,994 --> 00:02:17,052
Name.

39
00:02:18,796 --> 00:02:20,764
Excuse me, brother,
can I have a light?

40
00:02:51,429 --> 00:02:53,693
- How you doing, Alex?
- Hi, Jimmy.

41
00:04:51,482 --> 00:04:52,642
Excuse me.

42
00:06:07,925 --> 00:06:09,324
Say thank you.

43
00:06:28,379 --> 00:06:30,677
Way to go, Superman!

44
00:07:46,457 --> 00:07:48,584
<i>Your drink is on its way.</i>

45
00:07:49,593 --> 00:07:51,288
Sir.

46
00:07:51,495 --> 00:07:53,019
Excuse me...

47
00:07:55,032 --> 00:07:59,731
...but what if you want to program two
bilateral coordinates at once?

48
00:07:59,937 --> 00:08:01,962
You can't do that. It's impossible.

49
00:08:02,173 --> 00:08:03,868
- But if you can't...
- Oh, no.

50
00:08:04,075 --> 00:08:08,102
Computer technology is very advanced,
young lady, but it can't do that.

51
00:08:08,312 --> 00:08:11,281
But if you think we can't
do it that way...

52
00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:19,620
Good Lord.

53
00:08:20,224 --> 00:08:21,657
How did you do that?

54
00:08:21,859 --> 00:08:25,420
I don't know. I just did it.

55
00:08:44,448 --> 00:08:46,939
- Who's this?
- That's him, Ross Webster.

56
00:08:47,151 --> 00:08:50,143
They presented him with
the Humanitarian of the Year award.

57
00:08:50,354 --> 00:08:52,083
He is good-looking.

58
00:08:52,289 --> 00:08:54,223
Because I gave him f.2 at a 50th.

59
00:08:54,425 --> 00:08:56,188
One thing I don't understand...

60
00:08:56,394 --> 00:09:00,728
...the point of the story Lois wrote
is how Ross got this great honor...

61
00:09:00,931 --> 00:09:04,492
...and you bring me one picture of him
and 15 pictures of her.

62
00:09:04,702 --> 00:09:07,330
- Who is she?
- Lorelei Ambrosia. She's Webster's...

63
00:09:07,538 --> 00:09:10,200
She's just Webster's.
Let's leave it at that.

64
00:09:10,408 --> 00:09:13,036
- Who's this other woman?
- His sister, Vera Webster.

65
00:09:13,244 --> 00:09:14,541
- Picture looks fuzzy.
- What?

66
00:09:14,745 --> 00:09:18,476
The picture's fine, Chief.
She looks like that in real life.

67
00:09:19,083 --> 00:09:22,917
- She's VP of WEBSCOE Industries.
- I really don't understand you.

68
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,385
A boring banquet and you bring me
3,000 boring pictures.

69
00:09:26,624 --> 00:09:29,684
Yet Superman saves a man from
drowning on Third Avenue...

70
00:09:29,894 --> 00:09:32,727
...while you just stand there and
you don't bring me one picture!

71
00:09:32,963 --> 00:09:34,954
Chief, I didn't have
my camera with me.

72
00:09:35,166 --> 00:09:39,535
A photographer eats with his camera.
A photographer sleeps with his camera.

73
00:09:39,737 --> 00:09:42,171
- I'm glad I'm a writer.
- Mr. White, please.

74
00:09:42,373 --> 00:09:45,536
It's time for you to draw this month's
winning JINGO number.

75
00:09:45,743 --> 00:09:48,439
Prize is an all-expenses trip
to South America.

76
00:09:48,646 --> 00:09:51,274
- Why the idiot in circulation...
- Good morning.

77
00:09:51,482 --> 00:09:53,507
- Hi, Clark.
- Hi, Lois. Morning, Jimmy.

78
00:09:53,717 --> 00:09:55,480
You've got mustard on your lapel.

79
00:09:55,686 --> 00:09:57,677
Mr. White, I hate to interrupt...

80
00:09:57,888 --> 00:10:00,152
I'm busy.
I got a paper to get out here.

81
00:10:00,357 --> 00:10:02,382
It'll never replace
the printing press.

82
00:10:02,593 --> 00:10:05,585
- What's the number, Mr. White?
- 53.

83
00:10:07,064 --> 00:10:09,794
- Mr. White...
- 53!

84
00:10:10,034 --> 00:10:13,435
- Mr. White...
- You need to pull three more numbers.

85
00:10:13,637 --> 00:10:16,367
I promised I'd call them back today.
What do you think?

86
00:10:16,907 --> 00:10:20,570
- Well, I don't know, Kent...
- I think it'd make a terrific story.

87
00:10:21,812 --> 00:10:23,404
What's a terrific story?

88
00:10:23,614 --> 00:10:25,980
Kent's been invited
to his high school reunion.

89
00:10:26,417 --> 00:10:27,975
- Say.
- Yeah.

90
00:10:28,185 --> 00:10:29,982
Could we have the next number?

91
00:10:30,187 --> 00:10:32,621
It's practically an American ritual.
Right, Jimmy?

92
00:10:32,823 --> 00:10:36,725
I don't know. Most of the people
I know are still in high school.

93
00:10:40,431 --> 00:10:41,295
33.

94
00:10:41,499 --> 00:10:44,263
What I thought this story
would be about...

95
00:10:44,468 --> 00:10:46,095
33.

96
00:10:46,637 --> 00:10:50,164
- Is how the typical small town's
changed in the last 15 years.

97
00:10:50,374 --> 00:10:51,500
Take me, for example:

98
00:10:51,709 --> 00:10:55,406
Can I go back to middle America
now as a Metropolis sophisticate?

99
00:10:55,613 --> 00:10:58,548
I'm really excited about this.
I was looking around...

100
00:10:58,749 --> 00:11:01,217
...in my closet last night...

101
00:11:01,418 --> 00:11:05,252
...and even found
my old high school sweater.

102
00:11:07,558 --> 00:11:09,651
- Smallville.
- Mr. White.

103
00:11:10,327 --> 00:11:12,352
Can I go ahead and
make my travel plan?

104
00:11:12,563 --> 00:11:13,996
Same question about mine.

105
00:11:14,899 --> 00:11:18,665
Tell your people the prodigal son and
his photographer are coming home.

106
00:11:18,869 --> 00:11:20,700
Oh, gee, thanks, Mr. White.

107
00:11:22,573 --> 00:11:25,838
It isn't easy for me to lose
one of my best reporters.

108
00:11:26,043 --> 00:11:28,409
- That's okay.
- You deserve the vacation, Lois.

109
00:11:28,612 --> 00:11:29,840
Thank you.

110
00:11:32,516 --> 00:11:33,949
Lois, are you going someplace?

111
00:11:35,219 --> 00:11:38,814
Clark, you know some people get to go
all the way to Smallville...

112
00:11:39,023 --> 00:11:42,789
...and then there are others of us
who have to go to Bermuda.

113
00:11:43,227 --> 00:11:44,057
Golly.

114
00:11:44,895 --> 00:11:45,862
Bye.

115
00:11:47,731 --> 00:11:51,690
- Have fun.
- Mr. White, the next number, please.

116
00:11:51,902 --> 00:11:54,837
Well, I guess I better be going too.

117
00:11:56,807 --> 00:11:58,468
So I'll be going.

118
00:12:01,612 --> 00:12:02,601
Bye.

119
00:12:05,349 --> 00:12:07,510
Could we get a computer to do this?

120
00:12:30,874 --> 00:12:32,501
Hey, what is this?

121
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:33,540
First paycheck.

122
00:12:34,011 --> 00:12:38,243
This is the first rip-off, man!
Supposed to get 225 a week, right?

123
00:12:38,449 --> 00:12:41,680
This says, "$143.80."
How am I supposed to live on that?

124
00:12:41,885 --> 00:12:45,286
State tax, federal tax,
social security tax...

125
00:12:45,489 --> 00:12:48,014
So you still get some money
when you hit 65.

126
00:12:48,225 --> 00:12:50,420
So I'm getting money when I... 65?

127
00:12:50,661 --> 00:12:51,923
I want mine now!

128
00:12:52,129 --> 00:12:56,623
I want to enjoy it while I'm young.
Get up and get down. Boogie.

129
00:12:58,135 --> 00:13:02,902
Actually, it's probably more like
$143.80 and one half cent.

130
00:13:03,107 --> 00:13:07,476
There are always fractions left over,
but big corporations round it down.

131
00:13:07,678 --> 00:13:10,374
What do I do with half a cent?
Buy a thoroughbred mouse?

132
00:13:10,614 --> 00:13:12,479
Everybody loses those fractions?

133
00:13:12,683 --> 00:13:15,447
They don't lose them.
Can't lose what you never got.

134
00:13:15,686 --> 00:13:17,847
Then what happens?
The company gets them?

135
00:13:18,055 --> 00:13:22,685
They can't be bothered collecting that
from your paycheck any more than you.

136
00:13:22,926 --> 00:13:24,325
Then what happens to them?

137
00:13:24,561 --> 00:13:29,021
Well, they're just floating around
out there. The computers know where.

138
00:13:29,233 --> 00:13:30,723
How many sugars?

139
00:13:31,435 --> 00:13:32,800
One and a half.

140
00:13:40,177 --> 00:13:41,804
It's quitting time. You coming?

141
00:13:42,012 --> 00:13:46,745
Yeah. No, actually I got some
stuff to finish up so...

142
00:13:46,984 --> 00:13:51,785
Working overtime, huh? What are you
doing, buddy? Looking for a raise?

143
00:13:52,589 --> 00:13:55,023
Yeah, looking for a raise.

144
00:14:32,463 --> 00:14:33,487
You bet.

145
00:14:39,636 --> 00:14:43,333
But my Uncle Al on my father's side,
he won't eat her stuffing.

146
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:48,204
He says it should be on the outside
of the turkey but she puts it inside.

147
00:14:48,412 --> 00:14:52,576
Aunt Helen's my father's half sister.
I told you that, right?

148
00:14:52,783 --> 00:14:53,909
Yeah.

149
00:14:54,118 --> 00:14:55,745
- And anyway...
- Hey, hey.

150
00:14:56,153 --> 00:14:58,087
- Look at that.
- Wow!

151
00:15:08,899 --> 00:15:13,268
Okay, your choice:
Turn back or pull over till it's over.

152
00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:15,870
- How long?
- Can't tell with these fires.

153
00:15:16,073 --> 00:15:19,236
I mean, that fire...
That's spreading like wildfire.

154
00:15:19,443 --> 00:15:20,910
It's just a building burning.

155
00:15:21,111 --> 00:15:23,409
It's not just a building.
It's a chemical plant.

156
00:15:23,914 --> 00:15:27,179
You know what I mean.
It's like... It's like chemicals.

157
00:15:27,384 --> 00:15:32,014
If that stuff goes up in smoke,
it'll be a hairy time around here.

158
00:15:34,091 --> 00:15:34,921
- Clark.
- Yeah.

159
00:15:35,125 --> 00:15:37,457
I want you to keep them distracted.

160
00:15:37,661 --> 00:15:38,753
What are you doing?

161
00:15:38,962 --> 00:15:42,022
What am I doing?
Remember what the chief said?

162
00:15:42,232 --> 00:15:44,427
Photographer always
goes after a story.

163
00:15:44,635 --> 00:15:46,159
That could be dangerous.

164
00:15:46,370 --> 00:15:50,431
Danger goes with the territory,
Mr. Kent.

165
00:16:26,977 --> 00:16:28,501
Help me!

166
00:16:29,012 --> 00:16:30,206
Help me!

167
00:16:34,117 --> 00:16:36,449
- How can I help?
- Get this man a helmet.

168
00:16:36,653 --> 00:16:38,848
- Oh, it's you.
- How bad is it?

169
00:16:39,056 --> 00:16:43,425
It's a nightmare. Everything's either
explosive or flammable or worse.

170
00:16:47,631 --> 00:16:49,690
- Get the ladder truck.
- It won't reach.

171
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:52,095
My God, they're trapped!

172
00:16:52,836 --> 00:16:55,669
What's he gonna do?
Fly them down one at a time?

173
00:17:13,857 --> 00:17:16,052
Let's go! Everybody, down there!
Move it!

174
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:17,818
Come on! Hurry up!

175
00:17:18,028 --> 00:17:19,120
There you go.

176
00:17:23,033 --> 00:17:24,898
Right down there. Take it easy.

177
00:17:27,137 --> 00:17:28,968
All right. Everybody down there!

178
00:18:05,575 --> 00:18:07,736
Get out.
I'll show you the quickest way.

179
00:18:07,945 --> 00:18:10,038
Look after the others.
I can't leave here.

180
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:12,475
- Why not?
- I have to look after those.

181
00:18:12,683 --> 00:18:14,241
That's concentrated Beltric acid.

182
00:18:14,451 --> 00:18:17,511
If it heats up over 180 degrees,
we've got a crisis...

183
00:18:17,721 --> 00:18:20,053
...that'll make this fire
seem like a picnic.

184
00:18:20,257 --> 00:18:21,315
What does it do?

185
00:18:21,558 --> 00:18:24,356
As long as it remains stable,
it's just ordinary acid.

186
00:18:24,761 --> 00:18:28,026
But if it begins to heat up,
it'll turn volatile.

187
00:18:28,231 --> 00:18:31,462
You'll get a great cloud of smoke
that'll eat through anything.

188
00:18:31,668 --> 00:18:34,228
Steel, concrete, anything.

189
00:18:45,682 --> 00:18:46,876
Who the hell is that?

190
00:18:47,084 --> 00:18:51,885
- Hey, you! Get off of there!
- Just gonna get a couple more shots.

191
00:19:08,138 --> 00:19:11,471
Tell them to bring their hoses
back here! Quickly!

192
00:19:14,511 --> 00:19:15,569
Help!

193
00:19:16,413 --> 00:19:17,641
Help!

194
00:19:17,948 --> 00:19:18,915
Help me!

195
00:19:20,751 --> 00:19:24,243
Help! Somebody help me!

196
00:19:25,222 --> 00:19:26,814
- Help!
- It's all right.

197
00:19:27,057 --> 00:19:29,685
- Superman! My leg.
- I got you. Take it easy.

198
00:19:29,893 --> 00:19:31,588
We'll go nice and easy.

199
00:19:31,795 --> 00:19:35,595
Okay, I'm sorry.
All right? Here we go.

200
00:19:39,136 --> 00:19:41,696
Medics! Over here, please.

201
00:19:42,272 --> 00:19:44,433
That's it. Here you go.

202
00:19:44,641 --> 00:19:46,199
Go easy. It's the left leg.

203
00:19:47,611 --> 00:19:48,976
- Camera.
- Yeah.

204
00:19:50,447 --> 00:19:52,506
It's a clean break across the fibula.

205
00:19:53,083 --> 00:19:56,610
- My camera.
- Sorry, Jimmy. You'll be okay.

206
00:19:58,121 --> 00:20:02,683
Get the fire out! Or there'll be
a cloud of acid all over the East.

207
00:20:06,630 --> 00:20:09,190
- Christ, the pump house is gone!
- What?

208
00:20:09,399 --> 00:20:11,890
- The pump house!
- We've lost the water pressure!

209
00:20:13,570 --> 00:20:15,401
- We've got to have water!
- How?

210
00:20:15,605 --> 00:20:18,472
Lake Comooga's five miles away!
We'd need a five-mile hose!

211
00:20:18,675 --> 00:20:20,734
- Where's this lake?
- That way.

212
00:20:29,453 --> 00:20:33,082
- Tell them it's hopeless.
- We had an adequate water supply.

213
00:21:34,417 --> 00:21:35,315
Water!

214
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:52,491
I tell you, that man's a miracle!

215
00:22:18,295 --> 00:22:20,786
Carol, you got gorgeous!

216
00:22:32,042 --> 00:22:33,942
Look at you.

217
00:22:42,252 --> 00:22:45,449
That was against Mid-City.
I'll never forget it.

218
00:22:46,890 --> 00:22:48,619
Fourth quarter, score was tied...

219
00:22:49,292 --> 00:22:51,556
...we're back at the 25 yard line.

220
00:22:51,795 --> 00:22:55,026
Coach sends in play,
Right Flanker Option.

221
00:23:04,941 --> 00:23:07,136
You really have grown, Clark.

222
00:23:07,344 --> 00:23:09,175
You look very well, Miss Bannister.

223
00:23:09,379 --> 00:23:14,146
I can't complain. I take the stairs
a little slow and I have these spells.

224
00:23:14,951 --> 00:23:16,885
But really, I can't complain.

225
00:23:17,854 --> 00:23:18,821
<i>Lana?</i>

226
00:23:19,990 --> 00:23:21,048
<i>Clark?</i>

227
00:23:26,630 --> 00:23:30,191
Would you excuse me? There's
someone I'd like to say hello to.

228
00:23:33,603 --> 00:23:34,797
Lana?

229
00:23:36,172 --> 00:23:39,335
- Lana Lang? It's great to see you.
- Clark.

230
00:23:40,677 --> 00:23:44,078
- You look wonderful.
- Me? No, you look... Wow!

231
00:23:44,281 --> 00:23:47,250
- Let me give you a hand with that.
- I can manage.

232
00:23:50,854 --> 00:23:54,017
First time you've come back
since your mom passed away.

233
00:23:54,224 --> 00:23:56,124
Yeah. I'm sorry.

234
00:23:59,062 --> 00:24:00,222
I heard that you and...

235
00:24:01,197 --> 00:24:03,529
...Donald split up.
- Did you eat yet?

236
00:24:03,733 --> 00:24:04,791
No.

237
00:24:05,101 --> 00:24:07,763
Beg your pardon. Excuse me. Sorry.

238
00:24:11,641 --> 00:24:13,404
- That's not right.
- No?

239
00:24:13,610 --> 00:24:16,078
You're right about Donald and me...
Hold that.

240
00:24:16,279 --> 00:24:17,337
Oh, sure.

241
00:24:20,116 --> 00:24:21,583
- Hi, Kent.
- Oh.

242
00:24:21,951 --> 00:24:24,215
Hi. How you doing?

243
00:24:25,422 --> 00:24:27,720
I'm sorry. I'm going nuts.

244
00:24:31,661 --> 00:24:33,561
- Clark.
- Yeah.

245
00:24:34,431 --> 00:24:35,591
Lana.

246
00:24:36,633 --> 00:24:37,793
Uh-oh.

247
00:24:38,968 --> 00:24:40,094
Hey, sweet.

248
00:24:40,437 --> 00:24:41,631
Here I am.

249
00:24:42,806 --> 00:24:46,970
Remember when you were prom queen?
All us guys were waiting for a dance?

250
00:24:47,177 --> 00:24:50,237
There's only one guy on your
dance card now. Good old...

251
00:24:50,447 --> 00:24:51,846
Brad Wilson.

252
00:24:52,415 --> 00:24:54,883
- Hi, Brad.
- Hi, Kent.

253
00:24:55,218 --> 00:24:56,947
Long time no see.

254
00:24:57,153 --> 00:24:59,053
You know, see, see, see?

255
00:24:59,723 --> 00:25:02,248
- Come on, Lana.
- No, I can't.

256
00:25:02,692 --> 00:25:03,920
Clark already asked me.

257
00:25:04,127 --> 00:25:05,617
- I did?
- Yeah.

258
00:25:05,829 --> 00:25:06,659
Excuse me.

259
00:25:07,731 --> 00:25:09,596
Lana, I haven't danced...

260
00:25:54,411 --> 00:25:57,209
Ah, Gorman.
Another week, another check.

261
00:26:00,116 --> 00:26:04,052
Don't you have another one for me?
I put in a voucher for expenses.

262
00:26:04,254 --> 00:26:05,551
What?

263
00:26:08,858 --> 00:26:09,916
Yeah, yeah.

264
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:11,420
Here you go.

265
00:26:34,050 --> 00:26:35,813
Thanks for helping me out.

266
00:26:36,219 --> 00:26:38,710
A lot of guys would like
to be where I am.

267
00:26:38,955 --> 00:26:43,255
You'd be surprised at how many offers
I didn't get. Even Brad didn't stay.

268
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:47,021
- It really isn't easy.
- The streamers? You just pull.

269
00:26:47,263 --> 00:26:49,754
No, not streamers. Everything.

270
00:26:49,966 --> 00:26:52,298
Not that I'm complaining.
It's just that...

271
00:26:52,502 --> 00:26:55,471
...I don't know why, I just feel
like I can talk to you.

272
00:26:55,805 --> 00:26:56,669
What?

273
00:26:56,873 --> 00:26:59,205
I feel like I can talk to you!

274
00:27:00,176 --> 00:27:01,734
- You can?
- Yes.

275
00:27:01,945 --> 00:27:03,913
- You know something, Lana?
- What?

276
00:27:05,949 --> 00:27:07,314
I always...

277
00:27:08,051 --> 00:27:09,780
I always wished that you would.

278
00:27:09,986 --> 00:27:11,920
I mean, even back in high school.

279
00:27:12,155 --> 00:27:14,749
- Remember when you were...
- Queen of the prom.

280
00:27:15,358 --> 00:27:18,384
Three years after the royal wedding,
the king abdicated.

281
00:27:18,595 --> 00:27:20,085
Isn't that terrible?

282
00:27:20,296 --> 00:27:24,494
- Yeah, sure is.
- There's a ton of potato salad left.

283
00:27:25,401 --> 00:27:27,335
You know what the problem is?

284
00:27:28,404 --> 00:27:30,269
Don't know, too much mayonnaise?

285
00:27:30,473 --> 00:27:33,237
Donald loved mayonnaise.
Why would that be the problem?

286
00:27:33,443 --> 00:27:36,276
No, the problem is,
why do I stay in Smallville?

287
00:27:36,479 --> 00:27:38,242
I've asked myself that.

288
00:27:38,481 --> 00:27:42,975
Do you know how lucky you are to live
in Metropolis? The Big Apricot.

289
00:27:43,186 --> 00:27:47,350
- Well, you could...
- Easy to say. What about Ricky?

290
00:27:47,557 --> 00:27:48,421
Ricky?

291
00:27:48,625 --> 00:27:49,887
My little boy.

292
00:27:50,326 --> 00:27:52,419
- You? Oh, that's great.
- Yeah.

293
00:27:52,629 --> 00:27:57,157
At least here we have a house and
I've got a job that pays the bills.

294
00:27:57,367 --> 00:28:00,859
Except for last winter when
the fuel bills kept going up and up.

295
00:28:01,538 --> 00:28:04,302
Yeah. Even had to pawn
my diamond ring then.

296
00:28:04,674 --> 00:28:05,936
That's a shame.

297
00:28:13,683 --> 00:28:15,344
You never got married?

298
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:19,047
- Me?
- Yeah.

299
00:28:19,556 --> 00:28:20,989
Well, I was...

300
00:28:22,458 --> 00:28:23,982
No. Not...

301
00:28:33,169 --> 00:28:36,070
Years later you can look at
someone and think...

302
00:28:36,306 --> 00:28:39,036
..."Well, I guess that's
the one that got away."

303
00:28:43,947 --> 00:28:47,508
Give me that again, old buddy.
Run it by me just one more time.

304
00:28:47,717 --> 00:28:50,208
- $85,000.
- Missing.

305
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:53,947
Embezzled, Mr. Webster.
Stolen from the firm.

306
00:28:54,157 --> 00:28:55,351
By whom?

307
00:28:55,558 --> 00:28:58,049
That's what I want to know.
By whom? Whom?

308
00:28:58,294 --> 00:28:59,886
Vera, get ahold of yourself.

309
00:29:00,797 --> 00:29:02,162
Nobody else ever will.

310
00:29:02,865 --> 00:29:04,025
I don't know.

311
00:29:04,233 --> 00:29:05,200
Whom?

312
00:29:05,401 --> 00:29:07,562
In the old days, it was simple.

313
00:29:07,770 --> 00:29:12,104
We kept books, we knew what was
going in and what was paid out.

314
00:29:12,308 --> 00:29:13,969
If somebody wanted to rob you...

315
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:16,678
...they'd use a gun and say,
"Stick 'em up."

316
00:29:16,913 --> 00:29:20,007
Now they get blasted computers
to do their dirty work.

317
00:29:20,617 --> 00:29:23,484
My friend, you are yesterday.

318
00:29:23,686 --> 00:29:26,553
Whoever pulled this caper,
is tomorrow.

319
00:29:28,691 --> 00:29:30,852
Mr. Webster,
it's time for your massage.

320
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:32,721
Bubba, can she burst in...

321
00:29:32,962 --> 00:29:36,693
Now, now, Vera. Simpson,
you know my psychic nutritionist?

322
00:29:36,899 --> 00:29:41,029
- Hello.
- We are trying to hold a meeting here.

323
00:29:41,237 --> 00:29:45,298
Why don't you hold your breath
instead? Maybe you'll turn blue.

324
00:29:45,508 --> 00:29:48,773
- Improvement.
- I'm about to take a human life.

325
00:29:48,978 --> 00:29:52,106
Simpson, would you excuse us
for a second, please?

326
00:29:55,718 --> 00:29:58,744
- Mouths closed. Ears open.
- She's a big pig.

327
00:29:58,955 --> 00:30:02,049
I can't have anyone with me
who isn't with me.

328
00:30:02,392 --> 00:30:03,791
Now, girls.

329
00:30:04,227 --> 00:30:05,057
Simpson.

330
00:30:06,062 --> 00:30:07,495
Well, old chum. What now?

331
00:30:07,697 --> 00:30:10,393
Kiss the 85 thou goodbye?

332
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:14,400
Keep on paying the thief his salary
until he shakes the money tree again?

333
00:30:14,604 --> 00:30:17,698
- He's bound to slip sooner or later.
- Why?

334
00:30:17,907 --> 00:30:20,239
That's what they always say
in the movies.

335
00:30:20,443 --> 00:30:22,934
He won't slip up at all.
No, not at all.

336
00:30:23,146 --> 00:30:25,774
He'll keep quietly taking
the bread from our mouths.

337
00:30:25,982 --> 00:30:30,214
He'll keep a low profile and won't do
a thing to call attention to himself.

338
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:34,823
Unless, of course, he is
a complete and utter moron.

339
00:30:52,442 --> 00:30:54,205
I'll go first. Andrew.

340
00:30:54,410 --> 00:30:57,846
- I'll pick Chris.
- You feel good? You feel ready?

341
00:30:58,081 --> 00:30:59,378
Ricky, your shoe.

342
00:30:59,582 --> 00:31:02,813
- You mean, we've gotta take Ricky?
- You guys lost the toss.

343
00:31:03,019 --> 00:31:05,180
All right, come on Ricky.

344
00:31:05,388 --> 00:31:07,322
- Wait, wait...
- Come on, good luck.

345
00:31:08,458 --> 00:31:11,291
- I just can't stand this.
- Oh, Lana. It'll be okay.

346
00:31:11,494 --> 00:31:13,792
I know, I was a late bloomer myself.

347
00:31:13,996 --> 00:31:18,660
It's not just that he's small, he's
the only kid in town without a father.

348
00:31:19,102 --> 00:31:23,505
Oh, look. Stewed to the gills
in the middle of the afternoon.

349
00:31:23,706 --> 00:31:25,799
- I only had chocolate milk.
- No, him.

350
00:31:26,008 --> 00:31:27,475
Hey, sweet thing.

351
00:31:27,944 --> 00:31:29,912
Little kid getting hassled, huh?

352
00:31:30,513 --> 00:31:33,038
- Kent, you still here?
- I seem to be, Brad.

353
00:31:33,249 --> 00:31:35,945
All he needs is a few pointers
from the old champ here.

354
00:31:36,319 --> 00:31:38,947
I won the all-country bowling trophy
two years in a row.

355
00:31:39,155 --> 00:31:40,179
I didn't know that.

356
00:31:40,389 --> 00:31:42,857
Yeah. Natural athlete
can play any sport.

357
00:31:43,993 --> 00:31:46,860
- It's all right. It'll be okay.
- He'll make it worse.

358
00:31:53,302 --> 00:31:55,293
You watch, he'll get a spare.

359
00:31:55,638 --> 00:31:56,605
Come on, Ricky.

360
00:31:58,474 --> 00:32:00,271
Kid, you're holding it all wrong.

361
00:32:00,843 --> 00:32:04,142
- Let old Brad show you how it's done.
- Brad.

362
00:32:05,081 --> 00:32:09,108
Excuse me. Say, Brad, I think maybe
he'll be better off doing it his way.

363
00:32:09,318 --> 00:32:12,845
For a guy lucky to be waterboy,
you've got a big mouth.

364
00:32:13,256 --> 00:32:16,316
I don't think he needs a lesson
in front of the other kids.

365
00:32:16,526 --> 00:32:20,462
- He needs a man to show him.
- He's doing just fine. Excuse me.

366
00:32:22,298 --> 00:32:23,629
Here you go, Ricky.

367
00:32:23,833 --> 00:32:26,768
And give it your best shot.
Okay? There you go.

368
00:32:29,205 --> 00:32:30,433
Sorry.

369
00:32:46,522 --> 00:32:47,921
Gesundheit.

370
00:32:48,124 --> 00:32:49,250
Thank you.

371
00:32:52,328 --> 00:32:54,558
Hey, Gus, the boss wants to see you.

372
00:32:54,764 --> 00:32:57,324
He can see me all right.
Hello, Mr. Lewis.

373
00:32:57,533 --> 00:33:00,969
No, not that boss. The boss.

374
00:33:02,138 --> 00:33:03,605
You mean, the boss...

375
00:33:03,806 --> 00:33:05,296
...wants to see me?

376
00:33:05,508 --> 00:33:08,602
Oh, my God,
why would he want to see me?

377
00:33:08,811 --> 00:33:10,005
I mean...

378
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:13,612
Why would the boss want to see me?

379
00:33:14,884 --> 00:33:16,545
There's no reason.

380
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:19,344
Then why'd he?
Oh, I know!

381
00:33:19,555 --> 00:33:22,615
It's my suggestion for
the volleyball uniforms.

382
00:33:22,825 --> 00:33:24,053
That's it.

383
00:33:36,639 --> 00:33:39,836
Ross the boss. Ross the boss.
The boss!

384
00:33:40,776 --> 00:33:42,869
Be calm. Be cool. Be collected.

385
00:33:47,583 --> 00:33:50,575
Mr. Webster? Mr. Webster?

386
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:54,419
Mr. Webster, I did not...
Mr. Webster.

387
00:33:54,824 --> 00:33:56,883
Mr. August Gorman?

388
00:33:57,093 --> 00:33:58,253
August Gorman here.

389
00:33:58,461 --> 00:34:02,989
I know you're a man of compassion,
and I don't want to go to jail...

390
00:34:03,199 --> 00:34:05,190
...because they have
robbers and rapists...

391
00:34:05,401 --> 00:34:07,767
I just want to ask you one question.

392
00:34:07,970 --> 00:34:10,734
You've been a naughty guy,
haven't you?

393
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:12,339
Come on, admit it, now.

394
00:34:12,541 --> 00:34:15,066
You've been a little bit naughty,
haven't you?

395
00:34:15,278 --> 00:34:18,042
- I was kind of...
- That's all right. I understand.

396
00:34:18,247 --> 00:34:21,410
I can...
What do the young folks say today?

397
00:34:21,617 --> 00:34:24,279
"Dig where you're coming from,
brother."

398
00:34:24,487 --> 00:34:27,320
You want to be rich, right?

399
00:34:27,523 --> 00:34:31,050
I was born rich. Never worn
the same pair of socks twice.

400
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:32,750
What do you do with your socks?

401
00:34:32,962 --> 00:34:36,830
They're laundered and sent to
some charitable institution, I think.

402
00:34:37,033 --> 00:34:40,230
I don't know.
Maybe they turn them into rags...

403
00:34:40,436 --> 00:34:41,869
...or pen-wipers or something.

404
00:34:42,071 --> 00:34:43,732
Or maybe socks.

405
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:46,670
Yes! That never occurred to me.

406
00:34:46,876 --> 00:34:50,676
Gus, you know something?
You're a genius.

407
00:34:50,913 --> 00:34:54,542
A naughty genius, but what the hell?
Nobody's perfect. Cheers.

408
00:34:54,750 --> 00:34:57,776
Because of the half-cent thing
with the computers.

409
00:34:57,987 --> 00:35:00,888
No, no, because computers rule
the world today.

410
00:35:01,090 --> 00:35:04,753
The fellow that can fool the computers
can rule the world himself.

411
00:35:05,728 --> 00:35:09,220
I've been searching for somebody
who can make these machines do...

412
00:35:09,432 --> 00:35:11,764
...what they're not supposed to.
Get my drift?

413
00:35:12,168 --> 00:35:13,362
Yes!

414
00:35:14,036 --> 00:35:18,837
Webscoe, the Webscoe industrial
complex, is a family-owned cartel.

415
00:35:19,041 --> 00:35:20,906
Some magnesium here,
some zinc there.

416
00:35:21,110 --> 00:35:23,078
Railroads, farm machinery.
You follow?

417
00:35:23,279 --> 00:35:24,769
I follow you, sir.

418
00:35:24,981 --> 00:35:27,176
Gus, do you know what I want now?

419
00:35:27,383 --> 00:35:28,315
I want coffee.

420
00:35:28,517 --> 00:35:30,246
Black, cream, sugar, or?

421
00:35:30,453 --> 00:35:32,512
No, you don't seem to understand.

422
00:35:32,722 --> 00:35:36,158
Under different company names,
I control the price of coffee beans...

423
00:35:36,359 --> 00:35:40,489
...in Venezuela, Brazil, Bolivia,
Jamaica and the Republic of Gabon.

424
00:35:40,696 --> 00:35:44,462
But I've got a problem and I think
maybe you can help me.

425
00:35:44,667 --> 00:35:48,626
One country won't play ball with me.
You know how that can bug a guy.

426
00:35:48,838 --> 00:35:51,102
That could bug...
What country?

427
00:35:52,475 --> 00:35:53,567
Colombia.

428
00:35:53,776 --> 00:35:54,674
Colombia?

429
00:35:54,877 --> 00:35:57,903
Colombia has two import and exports,
and one of them's coffee.

430
00:35:58,114 --> 00:36:01,743
And I've tried to reason with them.
Believe me, I've tried.

431
00:36:01,951 --> 00:36:05,079
But this one miserable,
pissant little country...

432
00:36:05,287 --> 00:36:09,553
...has the gall to think it can
dictate the economy of an open market.

433
00:36:11,227 --> 00:36:13,457
Gus, my friend...

434
00:36:14,296 --> 00:36:17,094
...we're going to teach them
a lesson, aren't we?

435
00:36:18,134 --> 00:36:20,967
Destroy the entire
Colombian coffee crop...

436
00:36:21,170 --> 00:36:23,695
...right down to the last bean.

437
00:36:23,906 --> 00:36:26,101
- The last bean, we are.
- Right.

438
00:36:26,308 --> 00:36:29,709
But you got so much...

439
00:36:29,912 --> 00:36:32,540
A wise man once said, I think
it was Attila the Hun:

440
00:36:32,748 --> 00:36:35,342
"It is not enough that I succeed.

441
00:36:35,551 --> 00:36:38,486
Everyone else must fail."

442
00:36:38,754 --> 00:36:40,244
Seems fair.

443
00:36:40,556 --> 00:36:41,989
- Gus.
- What?

444
00:36:42,191 --> 00:36:45,888
You are going to do this for me.

445
00:36:48,464 --> 00:36:50,625
- How?
- The weather.

446
00:36:51,333 --> 00:36:53,028
You didn't say your mom was here.

447
00:36:53,235 --> 00:36:56,170
I'm his sister. His baby sister.

448
00:36:56,372 --> 00:36:59,398
Gus, tell me, have you ever
heard of Vulcan?

449
00:36:59,675 --> 00:37:01,040
Hi, Ms. Vulcan.

450
00:37:01,243 --> 00:37:03,973
Vulcan is the weather satellite
our government put up...

451
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:05,545
...to monitor the weather.

452
00:37:05,748 --> 00:37:09,980
But if somebody were to reprogram it,
it could do much more.

453
00:37:10,186 --> 00:37:11,813
It could make weather.

454
00:37:12,021 --> 00:37:13,511
Storms and floods.

455
00:37:13,722 --> 00:37:15,485
Blizzards, heat waves.

456
00:37:15,691 --> 00:37:16,851
How do you do that?

457
00:37:17,293 --> 00:37:20,558
Like everything else
in the 20th century, Gus.

458
00:37:20,763 --> 00:37:22,253
You push buttons.

459
00:37:23,933 --> 00:37:27,096
- There you go.
- It's the first time I won anything.

460
00:37:27,303 --> 00:37:28,531
You won my hand, Maury.

461
00:37:28,737 --> 00:37:31,570
But this is the first time
I won anything valuable.

462
00:37:31,774 --> 00:37:33,401
Let's get one with the sombreros.

463
00:37:33,609 --> 00:37:37,010
Mr. White, you'll be in this,
handing them their plane tickets.

464
00:37:37,213 --> 00:37:39,545
- Why do I have to do this?
- Why do I have to do this?

465
00:37:39,748 --> 00:37:43,149
You're lucky I didn't fire you.
I get a chance at exclusive photos...

466
00:37:43,352 --> 00:37:45,013
...of history's biggest
factory fire.

467
00:37:45,221 --> 00:37:47,917
He comes home with a broken leg
and 12 melted rolls of film.

468
00:37:48,124 --> 00:37:49,557
It was hot.

469
00:37:49,758 --> 00:37:51,885
Smile, Mr. White.

470
00:37:52,928 --> 00:37:55,692
South America!
I can't believe my luck!

471
00:37:55,998 --> 00:37:58,967
See, if you don't want them
to trace it back...

472
00:37:59,168 --> 00:38:02,228
...you've gotta punch in
to some little rinky-dink outfit...

473
00:38:02,438 --> 00:38:04,872
...that has a little
Mickey Mouse computer...

474
00:38:05,074 --> 00:38:08,043
Someplace you can sneak into, right?

475
00:38:08,244 --> 00:38:09,404
Somebody could...

476
00:38:09,612 --> 00:38:13,639
Someplace where nobody knows him
so they can't connect him with us.

477
00:38:13,849 --> 00:38:15,817
Webscoe has 112 subsidiaries.

478
00:38:16,018 --> 00:38:18,987
They're all linked into
the central computer system.

479
00:38:19,188 --> 00:38:20,780
How about someplace...

480
00:38:21,724 --> 00:38:22,816
...small?

481
00:38:25,461 --> 00:38:29,454
Whoa, there. This is Smallville.
We'll have a five-minute stop here.

482
00:38:30,399 --> 00:38:31,491
Mind your step.

483
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:33,463
Watch your step, please.

484
00:38:34,203 --> 00:38:35,170
Thanks, Selma.

485
00:38:35,371 --> 00:38:37,839
Thanks a lot, Lana.
Have a good day, now.

486
00:38:42,077 --> 00:38:43,601
Let me help you, Lana.

487
00:38:45,481 --> 00:38:47,176
I'm sorry.

488
00:38:49,885 --> 00:38:52,251
- Thanks, Clark.
- Sit down, Buster. Good boy.

489
00:38:52,454 --> 00:38:54,945
Come on, Buster, sit down.
Good boy.

490
00:38:55,157 --> 00:38:57,057
You all set? Great.

491
00:39:10,139 --> 00:39:11,868
I'm not saying another word.

492
00:39:12,341 --> 00:39:13,535
That's it.

493
00:39:16,912 --> 00:39:19,176
Jesus Christ!

494
00:39:23,819 --> 00:39:26,879
Don't they have picnics in Metropolis,
Mr. Kent?

495
00:39:27,089 --> 00:39:29,023
Well, not quite like this, Ricky.

496
00:39:29,225 --> 00:39:31,193
- Mom and I do this all the time.
- You do?

497
00:39:31,393 --> 00:39:34,362
- I'll help you.
- Stay close by and be careful, okay?

498
00:39:34,563 --> 00:39:35,860
Okay, Mom.

499
00:39:36,065 --> 00:39:39,432
Come on, Buster. Let's find you
a rabbit. Come on. Rabbit.

500
00:39:39,635 --> 00:39:41,569
This is so nice for him.

501
00:39:41,770 --> 00:39:45,137
It's even nicer when there's
a man around, which isn't that often.

502
00:39:45,341 --> 00:39:47,673
- There's a lot of choices.
- The good ones are married.

503
00:39:47,876 --> 00:39:50,401
So Brad thinks he's
God's gift to women.

504
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:54,072
He won't take no for an answer,
but he's the only one asking.

505
00:39:54,283 --> 00:39:56,911
No, Lana, I meant
there's a lot of choices here.

506
00:39:57,119 --> 00:39:59,644
This is really quite some picnic.
There's...

507
00:40:00,456 --> 00:40:01,753
...some of that.

508
00:40:03,158 --> 00:40:04,455
Green stuff.

509
00:40:05,961 --> 00:40:07,588
Hey, pâté.

510
00:40:09,898 --> 00:40:12,332
Boy, this pâté is really unusual.

511
00:40:12,868 --> 00:40:15,166
I didn't make any...
Oh, Clark.

512
00:40:15,371 --> 00:40:17,635
That's Buster's dog food.

513
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:20,030
- It's good.
- Don't eat it!

514
00:40:20,242 --> 00:40:21,607
What time's the dog eat?

515
00:40:21,810 --> 00:40:23,675
- This is nice.
- Here.

516
00:40:23,879 --> 00:40:25,403
It's all right, Lana.

517
00:40:27,016 --> 00:40:28,210
Thanks.

518
00:40:30,019 --> 00:40:31,919
Hey, where you going?
Come on!

519
00:40:32,121 --> 00:40:34,021
Buster, stop messing about!

520
00:40:37,426 --> 00:40:38,916
- How much longer?
- I thought...

521
00:40:39,128 --> 00:40:41,926
- Sorry. No, go ahead.
- You.

522
00:40:48,437 --> 00:40:50,268
I was just thinking that...

523
00:40:50,472 --> 00:40:53,441
...somebody like you could do
really well in Metropolis.

524
00:40:53,976 --> 00:40:58,310
I have to face it. I'm not gonna
find what I want in Smallville anymore.

525
00:41:00,883 --> 00:41:04,580
Could I make it in Metropolis?
What would I do when I got there?

526
00:41:07,089 --> 00:41:08,078
Call me.

527
00:41:08,290 --> 00:41:11,259
- No, I wouldn't want to call you.
- You don't want to call?

528
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:15,794
Yes, I want to call you, but I
wouldn't want to be a nuisance to you.

529
00:41:16,298 --> 00:41:18,926
I don't think you could ever
be a nuisance to me.

530
00:41:21,337 --> 00:41:22,998
Clark, may I tell you something?

531
00:41:27,009 --> 00:41:28,442
My oil pan is leaking.

532
00:41:34,383 --> 00:41:36,180
There's something dripping.

533
00:41:36,385 --> 00:41:37,943
- Can I help?
- No, thanks.

534
00:41:38,554 --> 00:41:41,955
With all the car trouble I have,
I studied up on auto repair.

535
00:41:42,524 --> 00:41:44,048
Look at this.

536
00:41:44,993 --> 00:41:46,551
Oh, boy.

537
00:42:13,055 --> 00:42:16,582
I think I'll just go see
if Ricky's all right. You okay?

538
00:43:05,007 --> 00:43:07,032
Gosh, is he all right?

539
00:43:19,354 --> 00:43:20,878
Superman?

540
00:43:21,089 --> 00:43:22,420
That's me.

541
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:27,191
Mom! Mom!

542
00:43:29,631 --> 00:43:33,032
There you go. He's all right,
but have a doctor check him.

543
00:43:33,235 --> 00:43:34,964
Thank you.

544
00:43:35,170 --> 00:43:37,604
- I'm Lana Lang. This is Ricky.
- Nice to meet you.

545
00:43:37,806 --> 00:43:38,966
And this is Clark.

546
00:43:39,174 --> 00:43:42,041
I really have to be going.
So long, Ricky. Bye.

547
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:45,879
We were flying, Mom!

548
00:43:46,081 --> 00:43:47,514
What were you doing, anyway?

549
00:43:47,716 --> 00:43:49,445
I was looking for Buster.

550
00:43:50,886 --> 00:43:52,080
I found him!

551
00:43:53,355 --> 00:43:54,822
Come on, boy. That's it.

552
00:43:55,023 --> 00:43:57,651
Mr. Kent, Superman was here!

553
00:43:57,860 --> 00:43:59,953
- What?
- Yes, he really was.

554
00:44:00,863 --> 00:44:02,421
Aren't you excited?

555
00:44:02,631 --> 00:44:05,691
I'm from Metropolis.
I see Superman every day.

556
00:44:05,901 --> 00:44:08,893
You do? Could you get me
his autograph?

557
00:44:11,473 --> 00:44:15,375
I don't know. If I had a nickel
for every time some little kid...

558
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:39,731
Yeah? What do you want?

559
00:44:39,935 --> 00:44:41,664
We're in big trouble, aren't we?

560
00:44:41,870 --> 00:44:43,701
- What?
- We're in big trouble.

561
00:44:43,906 --> 00:44:45,396
First, they lost the invoice.

562
00:44:45,607 --> 00:44:49,236
When they found it, they realized
they came up short on a few items.

563
00:44:49,444 --> 00:44:53,642
So I rented a car because I missed the
plane from Cleveland. 4:00, you know.

564
00:44:54,082 --> 00:44:57,347
And a flat tire on the highway.
What a kicker.

565
00:44:57,553 --> 00:45:00,681
Had to fix it myself
with these little pinkies.

566
00:45:01,156 --> 00:45:05,456
And I figured your boss was gonna be
real peeved, you know what I mean?

567
00:45:05,827 --> 00:45:06,816
What do you mean?

568
00:45:07,029 --> 00:45:09,725
He is going to hang our butts
against the wall.

569
00:45:10,198 --> 00:45:12,792
He wanted this special order
installed...

570
00:45:13,001 --> 00:45:15,595
...in his office by tomorrow morning.

571
00:45:15,804 --> 00:45:18,034
So let me in because
I gotta set it up tonight.

572
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:19,502
Get all what set up?

573
00:45:29,651 --> 00:45:33,348
Pal, you are a real lifesaver.
I mean, a real lifesaver.

574
00:45:33,555 --> 00:45:35,750
- Which way's the office?
- Straight ahead.

575
00:45:35,958 --> 00:45:38,620
- Follow me.
- I'm right behind you.

576
00:45:40,329 --> 00:45:42,820
Not bad. It's pretty good.

577
00:45:43,832 --> 00:45:46,130
You know what's wrong with
this Singapore... wing?

578
00:45:46,335 --> 00:45:50,066
Sling! Singapore Sling.

579
00:45:50,272 --> 00:45:52,536
What's wrong with it?

580
00:45:52,741 --> 00:45:54,606
There's not enough vodka in it.

581
00:45:54,810 --> 00:45:57,438
There's no vodka in it!

582
00:45:57,646 --> 00:46:00,171
What did I tell you?
Put some vodka in it.

583
00:46:00,382 --> 00:46:03,180
What did you... you know?

584
00:46:09,424 --> 00:46:12,154
Here. There's vodka in it now, buddy.

585
00:46:16,431 --> 00:46:17,420
Yeah, perfect.

586
00:46:17,799 --> 00:46:20,734
- You never do pass out, do you?
- Nope.

587
00:46:25,107 --> 00:46:26,335
Never.

588
00:46:27,275 --> 00:46:29,368
Job well done, buddy.

589
00:46:29,778 --> 00:46:32,110
You thought I was drunk too,
didn't you?

590
00:46:32,814 --> 00:46:33,781
Fooled you.

591
00:46:33,982 --> 00:46:36,507
Get the keys, get the keys.

592
00:47:01,209 --> 00:47:03,006
Hello, baby!

593
00:47:03,779 --> 00:47:05,269
How's the little baby?

594
00:47:07,349 --> 00:47:11,149
All right, let's get down to it.
Let's do it.

595
00:47:12,854 --> 00:47:15,948
One, two, button your shoe.

596
00:47:32,107 --> 00:47:36,407
"Both keys at the same time"?

597
00:47:50,692 --> 00:47:52,421
Wait. Wait a minute.

598
00:47:52,661 --> 00:47:54,424
Think you've won, don't you?

599
00:47:55,931 --> 00:47:58,058
The Philly Flash!

600
00:48:48,850 --> 00:48:50,943
Okay, ready?

601
00:48:52,020 --> 00:48:54,011
One, two, three!

602
00:49:07,261 --> 00:49:09,354
We'll see what we'll see.

603
00:51:29,169 --> 00:51:30,363
Come on, please.

604
00:51:33,273 --> 00:51:34,501
There it is!

605
00:51:34,708 --> 00:51:36,198
Hello! Now...

606
00:51:36,410 --> 00:51:38,105
...getting down to business.

607
00:51:41,181 --> 00:51:43,081
I am a genius.

608
00:51:44,618 --> 00:51:46,245
I am a...

609
00:51:55,495 --> 00:51:56,860
Longitude...

610
00:51:57,064 --> 00:51:59,862
...and the other thing.
Latitude, right?

611
00:52:16,783 --> 00:52:19,650
Oh, look, Maury.
A native wedding.

612
00:52:44,644 --> 00:52:47,772
No one said at the <i>Daily Planet</i>
that this is the rainy season!

613
00:53:25,685 --> 00:53:28,813
<i>Meteorologists are baffled by</i>
<i>the tornado and rainstorms...</i>

614
00:53:29,022 --> 00:53:31,820
<i>... that struck Colombia</i>
<i>this afternoon...</i>

615
00:53:32,025 --> 00:53:36,553
<i>... threatening to destroy its entire</i>
<i>coffee crop for the next five years.</i>

616
00:53:36,763 --> 00:53:38,390
<i>Gale force winds up to...</i>

617
00:53:38,598 --> 00:53:41,692
...an incredible 250 miles an hour
lashed the countryside...

618
00:53:42,202 --> 00:53:46,605
...while 12 inches of rainfall have
already been recorded in just one day.

619
00:53:47,274 --> 00:53:51,540
<i>A spokesman for the Department of</i>
<i>Meteorology said, this was, I quote:</i>

620
00:53:51,745 --> 00:53:55,442
<i>"The most awesome display of</i>
<i>natural forces since Noah's ark. "</i>

621
00:53:55,649 --> 00:53:58,482
If I laugh any harder,
I'll split my sides!

622
00:53:58,685 --> 00:54:01,779
<i>- To defy all laws of</i>
<i>weather systems known to science.</i>

623
00:54:04,958 --> 00:54:06,016
What a shame.

624
00:54:07,961 --> 00:54:10,521
Poor little Colombia. Well...

625
00:54:21,708 --> 00:54:24,233
I'm gonna get you for that,
you big silly!

626
00:54:24,444 --> 00:54:27,345
Bubba, do you realize
what we're onto?

627
00:54:27,547 --> 00:54:29,105
Do I?

628
00:54:29,316 --> 00:54:32,410
Every time a drunk sobers up,
he'll drink Webster coffee.

629
00:54:32,619 --> 00:54:34,610
Why stop at coffee?

630
00:54:34,988 --> 00:54:38,719
A cup of coffee gets the world
off to work in the morning.

631
00:54:38,925 --> 00:54:41,018
But what keeps the world working?

632
00:54:41,895 --> 00:54:42,884
Diet soda?

633
00:54:44,164 --> 00:54:46,257
Vera, you mean?
You mean?

634
00:54:46,466 --> 00:54:48,866
Today, coffee.

635
00:54:49,069 --> 00:54:50,593
Tomorrow...

636
00:54:50,804 --> 00:54:51,634
...the oil!

637
00:54:51,838 --> 00:54:53,931
- Oil?
- If Gus can push the right buttons...

638
00:54:54,140 --> 00:54:57,166
I can have it all.
Holy cats!

639
00:54:57,377 --> 00:54:58,969
All the oil.

640
00:54:59,179 --> 00:55:00,373
All the pumps.

641
00:55:00,580 --> 00:55:02,013
All the tankers.

642
00:55:02,215 --> 00:55:03,773
This is some nifty idea, Vera.

643
00:55:03,984 --> 00:55:05,645
- Boss?
- Very nifty.

644
00:55:05,852 --> 00:55:08,320
- Just the man I want to see.
- It's not my fault.

645
00:55:08,522 --> 00:55:10,217
Isn't it neat? There...

646
00:55:10,490 --> 00:55:12,321
- What's not your fault?
- Superman.

647
00:55:13,026 --> 00:55:15,620
How was I to know he'd start
doing his thing...

648
00:55:15,829 --> 00:55:17,888
...when you started doing your thing?

649
00:55:18,098 --> 00:55:20,862
- What are you talking about?
- What am I talk?

650
00:55:21,067 --> 00:55:23,968
It was just on television, man.
Didn't you see it?

651
00:55:24,170 --> 00:55:25,535
Don't call me "man."

652
00:55:25,739 --> 00:55:28,003
I just saw Colombia bite the dust.

653
00:55:28,208 --> 00:55:32,440
You didn't see the man come flying
out of the sky? It was him!

654
00:55:32,946 --> 00:55:35,176
With his cape flapping in the...

655
00:55:39,953 --> 00:55:41,580
His cape was flapping in the wind!

656
00:55:41,788 --> 00:55:44,052
He was flying! He was great!

657
00:55:44,257 --> 00:55:46,054
He was just flying around...

658
00:55:46,326 --> 00:55:49,693
<i>His cape was blowing in the wind.</i>
<i>It looked like a flag!</i>

659
00:55:50,897 --> 00:55:53,832
And he landed right in the middle
of this big plantation!

660
00:55:56,169 --> 00:55:59,400
And he checked everything out
with his x-ray vision.

661
00:55:59,606 --> 00:56:04,134
And then he put these laser beams
out of his eyes onto everything.

662
00:56:04,945 --> 00:56:06,503
<i>Straight-out laser points.</i>

663
00:56:07,180 --> 00:56:09,011
<i>Dried up everything!</i>

664
00:56:09,215 --> 00:56:10,682
Just like that!

665
00:56:10,884 --> 00:56:13,944
Dried it up,
like the machines in the men's rooms.

666
00:56:14,154 --> 00:56:15,121
You know what I mean?

667
00:56:15,322 --> 00:56:17,620
Hot air comes out when you put
your hands under.

668
00:56:17,824 --> 00:56:19,485
Sometimes they don't work.

669
00:56:19,693 --> 00:56:20,990
But Superman's works!

670
00:56:21,194 --> 00:56:24,220
You think he stood around
to take bows? Not this man.

671
00:56:24,431 --> 00:56:27,025
No, sir. He flies off again!

672
00:56:27,233 --> 00:56:29,667
Then he saw what
really caused the trouble.

673
00:56:29,869 --> 00:56:31,632
He flew into the tornado...

674
00:56:31,838 --> 00:56:35,467
...went down to the bottom of it,
and turned it upside down!

675
00:56:35,675 --> 00:56:39,076
<i>He made the little end on top</i>
<i>and the big end on the bottom!</i>

676
00:56:39,279 --> 00:56:41,679
I was gonna go crazy!

677
00:56:45,485 --> 00:56:47,043
Big end was on the bottom.

678
00:56:49,956 --> 00:56:52,424
Mr. Ross, it was...
The big...

679
00:56:55,228 --> 00:56:56,490
Superman's bad.

680
00:56:57,530 --> 00:56:58,997
I'll say he was.

681
00:56:59,199 --> 00:57:01,394
I mean, he was bad!

682
00:57:01,701 --> 00:57:02,759
No.

683
00:57:06,373 --> 00:57:07,738
Here, let me help.

684
00:57:07,941 --> 00:57:11,274
- The perfect plan. Foolproof!
- And we were the fools.

685
00:57:11,478 --> 00:57:15,278
It's not my fault.
I did what I was supposed to do.

686
00:57:15,782 --> 00:57:19,445
He ruined it.
That lousy do-gooder ruined it.

687
00:57:20,954 --> 00:57:25,584
Now that he's pulled off this stunt,
he'll try and ruin my oil scheme too.

688
00:57:27,560 --> 00:57:29,289
- I've got to get rid of him.
- How?

689
00:57:29,496 --> 00:57:31,555
Shoot him?
You know about him and bullets.

690
00:57:32,065 --> 00:57:34,033
- Kryptonite.
- What?

691
00:57:35,368 --> 00:57:38,769
Or krypton-ham, or krypton-heimer?

692
00:57:39,139 --> 00:57:42,267
I forget what you call it,
but it's stuff that can hurt Superman.

693
00:57:42,475 --> 00:57:45,308
- How do you know?
- I know a few things.

694
00:57:45,512 --> 00:57:47,036
I know,
from the graffiti I saw.

695
00:57:47,247 --> 00:57:48,612
Wait a second.

696
00:57:48,815 --> 00:57:49,975
She's right.

697
00:57:50,183 --> 00:57:53,380
I remember reading about it
in an interview with him.

698
00:57:53,586 --> 00:57:54,814
Where is it from?

699
00:57:55,021 --> 00:57:57,285
The planet Superman came from:
Krypton.

700
00:57:57,490 --> 00:57:58,923
Where is Krypton?

701
00:57:59,125 --> 00:58:00,422
It's nowhere.

702
00:58:00,627 --> 00:58:02,254
It blew up in space, years ago.

703
00:58:02,462 --> 00:58:05,954
They sent Superman here from there
when he was just a baby.

704
00:58:06,166 --> 00:58:07,258
I know some things too.

705
00:58:07,467 --> 00:58:10,959
Wait a minute. You know what happens
when a planet explodes.

706
00:58:11,171 --> 00:58:14,698
- Debris. Things floating in space.
- So?

707
00:58:14,908 --> 00:58:18,810
So all we have to do is find out
where in heaven Krypton used to be.

708
00:58:19,012 --> 00:58:21,913
Then good ol' Gus contacts
the Vulcan satellite.

709
00:58:22,115 --> 00:58:24,242
OI' Gus has been doing some thinking.

710
00:58:24,451 --> 00:58:26,316
That's why I keep you around.

711
00:58:26,786 --> 00:58:30,813
I've been thinking that I'm not making
enough money for this gig.

712
00:58:31,524 --> 00:58:34,857
Gus, if there's anything I hate...

713
00:58:35,595 --> 00:58:36,789
...it's greed.

714
00:58:36,996 --> 00:58:40,090
Greed? Mr. Ross, just a minute.

715
00:58:40,300 --> 00:58:42,165
Let me tell you something.

716
00:58:42,669 --> 00:58:44,102
I can't ski!

717
00:59:16,736 --> 00:59:18,829
<i>Once Gus contacts</i>
<i>the Vulcan satellite...</i>

718
00:59:19,038 --> 00:59:20,972
<i>... he orders it to search</i>
<i>through space...</i>

719
00:59:21,174 --> 00:59:23,972
<i>... around where Krypton</i>
<i>went bye-bye.</i>

720
00:59:33,453 --> 00:59:37,048
<i>Then the laser probe locks</i>
<i>onto a floating chunk of Kryptonite.</i>

721
00:59:37,257 --> 00:59:39,282
<i>The computer analyzes</i>
<i>the components...</i>

722
00:59:39,492 --> 00:59:42,791
<i>... and the boys at the lab</i>
<i>duplicate the stuff down here.</i>

723
00:59:43,363 --> 00:59:45,194
"Unknown"?

724
00:59:45,665 --> 00:59:47,223
"Unknown"?

725
01:00:04,417 --> 01:00:06,578
What the hell,
he ain't gonna smoke it.

726
01:00:12,592 --> 01:00:15,083
Mr. White can't be responsible.

727
01:00:17,330 --> 01:00:18,524
Where is he?

728
01:00:18,731 --> 01:00:20,323
Please, Mr. Stokis.

729
01:00:20,767 --> 01:00:22,462
He'll pay for this.

730
01:00:23,970 --> 01:00:25,494
Get out your wallet!

731
01:00:26,506 --> 01:00:27,336
Good morning.

732
01:00:27,540 --> 01:00:29,770
Don't you "good morning" me.

733
01:00:31,211 --> 01:00:35,409
"Old, old relationships
suddenly seem very much the same.

734
01:00:35,715 --> 01:00:37,239
The prettiest girl in the school..."

735
01:00:39,085 --> 01:00:41,383
- is still the prettiest girl
in the school.

736
01:00:45,959 --> 01:00:49,224
- Hello?
<i>- Hello. Oh, hi, Clark.</i>

737
01:00:49,429 --> 01:00:53,991
Lana! Hi, I was just
thinking about you.

738
01:00:55,735 --> 01:00:57,930
Listen, I have a problem with Ricky.

739
01:00:58,137 --> 01:00:59,399
What happened to Ricky?

740
01:00:59,606 --> 01:01:03,098
It's Superman's autograph you got him.
He got carried away...

741
01:01:03,309 --> 01:01:06,335
...and told the kids Superman was
coming on his birthday.

742
01:01:06,546 --> 01:01:07,774
Okay, it was wrong...

743
01:01:07,981 --> 01:01:11,644
...but when Wednesday comes
and Superman doesn't show up...

744
01:01:12,652 --> 01:01:16,281
Lana, in this case I think I can go
ahead and speak for Superman.

745
01:01:16,489 --> 01:01:18,514
I mean, he and I are
pretty close.

746
01:01:18,725 --> 01:01:22,752
You can tell Ricky that Superman
will be there on Wednesday, all right?

747
01:01:24,497 --> 01:01:27,933
Well, he's gonna get the best
home-cooked meal he's had...

748
01:01:28,301 --> 01:01:29,461
...in a long time.

749
01:01:29,669 --> 01:01:31,603
<i>Tell Superman we think</i>
<i>he's wonderful.</i>

750
01:01:31,804 --> 01:01:32,634
All right.

751
01:01:32,872 --> 01:01:34,931
- But, Clark...
<i>- Yeah?</i>

752
01:01:35,308 --> 01:01:36,707
...you're the best.

753
01:01:41,247 --> 01:01:44,114
And I'll take it to
the Supreme Court if I have to.

754
01:01:44,317 --> 01:01:47,616
But it wasn't our fault.
It was an act of God.

755
01:01:47,820 --> 01:01:49,617
In a church?

756
01:02:02,368 --> 01:02:03,335
Hey!

757
01:02:03,536 --> 01:02:05,504
Here's that compound you ordered.

758
01:02:05,705 --> 01:02:07,570
Can't imagine what you want with it.

759
01:02:07,774 --> 01:02:09,139
But you got it.

760
01:02:15,448 --> 01:02:18,349
What the hell am I afraid for?
I'm from Earth.

761
01:02:24,057 --> 01:02:26,252
I really wasn't expecting all this.

762
01:02:26,459 --> 01:02:28,984
I guess they did get
a little carried away.

763
01:02:42,842 --> 01:02:46,073
Superman, we all know...

764
01:02:46,746 --> 01:02:49,476
...that you're not looking for
honors and awards.

765
01:02:50,316 --> 01:02:53,911
But when we heard that you were
coming to see your pal Ricky...

766
01:02:54,120 --> 01:02:57,920
...we realized that this was
our chance to say thank you.

767
01:02:58,124 --> 01:03:00,490
First, for putting out
the Lake Camooga fire.

768
01:03:00,994 --> 01:03:04,225
And not least, for saving
little Ricky.

769
01:03:04,731 --> 01:03:07,393
So since you already have
the key to our hearts...

770
01:03:07,600 --> 01:03:09,727
...Superman...

771
01:03:09,936 --> 01:03:13,997
...may I present you
with the key to the city.

772
01:03:14,207 --> 01:03:15,572
Thank you, sir.

773
01:03:19,645 --> 01:03:20,839
Thank you.

774
01:03:37,296 --> 01:03:38,991
As you were.

775
01:03:41,968 --> 01:03:43,333
Now listen up.

776
01:03:43,803 --> 01:03:45,600
I just came in directly...

777
01:03:45,805 --> 01:03:48,000
...from the Pentagon...

778
01:03:48,207 --> 01:03:52,303
...and you better believe there's
a damn good reason that I did.

779
01:03:53,346 --> 01:03:55,610
Because God has given us...

780
01:03:55,815 --> 01:03:59,273
...one of the greatest gifts
in the world:

781
01:03:59,685 --> 01:04:01,414
Chemicals.

782
01:04:02,455 --> 01:04:07,051
Now you people, you like to go sit
in church on Sunday, don't you?

783
01:04:07,427 --> 01:04:09,918
You like to sit and watch
the Super Bowl.

784
01:04:10,129 --> 01:04:11,118
Yeah.

785
01:04:11,330 --> 01:04:13,389
Sit on what?!

786
01:04:14,801 --> 01:04:18,999
You sit on molded, plastic seats!

787
01:04:19,772 --> 01:04:23,367
Molded to your well-fed behinds.

788
01:04:24,877 --> 01:04:29,143
Now, I don't have to tell you
that America leads the world...

789
01:04:29,348 --> 01:04:30,679
...in high-grade plastics.

790
01:04:31,150 --> 01:04:32,617
We cannot afford...

791
01:04:32,819 --> 01:04:35,515
...a chemical-plastics gap.

792
01:04:36,756 --> 01:04:37,950
Now, listen to me.

793
01:04:38,724 --> 01:04:40,351
Do you want...

794
01:04:40,560 --> 01:04:44,929
...our president of the United States
sitting down...

795
01:04:45,698 --> 01:04:47,689
...to write a peace treaty...

796
01:04:47,900 --> 01:04:50,767
...and have his ballpoint pen
bust open...

797
01:04:50,970 --> 01:04:54,167
...and the ink run out all over
his nice, clean pants...

798
01:04:54,373 --> 01:04:56,204
...in front of the world leaders?

799
01:04:56,409 --> 01:04:58,240
No. No.

800
01:04:58,744 --> 01:05:00,575
Now, we all know...

801
01:05:00,780 --> 01:05:05,080
...that last week, half of
this great nation of ours...

802
01:05:05,284 --> 01:05:06,911
...almost bit the bullet...

803
01:05:07,520 --> 01:05:09,988
...if it wasn't for this man here.

804
01:05:12,158 --> 01:05:16,527
And all I can say is,
thank the Lord for Superman.

805
01:05:22,502 --> 01:05:24,629
Superman, you saved our bacon...

806
01:05:24,837 --> 01:05:27,135
...and I'd like to show our gratitude.

807
01:05:30,276 --> 01:05:34,645
This is a small token of our
appreciation...

808
01:05:34,847 --> 01:05:39,477
...to show to you for saving us
from a chemical plant disaster.

809
01:05:45,725 --> 01:05:47,420
Thank you very much, general.

810
01:05:47,894 --> 01:05:50,124
This is very nice. Thank you.

811
01:06:01,607 --> 01:06:02,539
It's very nice.

812
01:06:09,949 --> 01:06:13,646
Unknown. How am I supposed to know
what "unknown" means?

813
01:06:13,853 --> 01:06:16,879
It means unknown. It means
nobody knows what it means.

814
01:06:17,089 --> 01:06:19,250
- Hello, boss?
<i>- Gus?</i>

815
01:06:19,759 --> 01:06:22,592
- Gus Gorman here.
<i>- I know that. How did it go?</i>

816
01:06:23,329 --> 01:06:26,890
You know how they're always trying to
find the secret recipe...

817
01:06:27,099 --> 01:06:28,896
...in that chicken in the bucket?

818
01:06:29,101 --> 01:06:31,126
And nobody seems to know
the ingredient...

819
01:06:31,337 --> 01:06:33,498
...because it's unknown, right?

820
01:06:34,173 --> 01:06:38,439
In the Kryptonite there was an unknown
element and Superman didn't die.

821
01:06:39,345 --> 01:06:41,438
He didn't die.

822
01:06:42,114 --> 01:06:44,776
I ask you to kill Superman...

823
01:06:44,984 --> 01:06:49,182
...and you're telling me you couldn't
even do that one simple thing.

824
01:06:53,459 --> 01:06:54,585
Hello?

825
01:07:08,541 --> 01:07:11,066
He hasn't had an afternoon nap
for years.

826
01:07:11,277 --> 01:07:14,940
This is the biggest day of his life.
I don't know how to thank you.

827
01:07:15,147 --> 01:07:16,774
You did with that wonderful lunch.

828
01:07:16,983 --> 01:07:20,146
Oh, well, I do like to cook.

829
01:07:21,187 --> 01:07:23,178
- You'll take some coffee?
- Yes, please.

830
01:07:23,389 --> 01:07:25,516
- Decaffeinated, of course.
- Right.

831
01:07:30,529 --> 01:07:32,997
Hello? Yes.

832
01:07:34,734 --> 01:07:36,065
What?

833
01:07:36,402 --> 01:07:38,267
Oh, really?

834
01:07:38,471 --> 01:07:39,665
Yeah, he's here.

835
01:07:39,872 --> 01:07:41,863
I'll tell him. Okay, thanks.
Bye-bye.

836
01:07:43,009 --> 01:07:44,977
That was my friend Betty.

837
01:07:45,177 --> 01:07:48,669
There's an accident on the bridge.
A trailer crashed through the rail.

838
01:07:48,881 --> 01:07:51,941
It's hanging off the bridge
and the driver's in the cab.

839
01:07:52,485 --> 01:07:54,885
I'm sorry.
I hate to make you rush off.

840
01:07:55,588 --> 01:07:56,850
Well, there's no rush.

841
01:07:57,590 --> 01:07:58,454
But the bridge...

842
01:07:58,658 --> 01:08:01,286
It's okay.
I always get there on time.

843
01:08:01,494 --> 01:08:03,155
Come on, let's relax a little.

844
01:08:17,009 --> 01:08:20,501
It's unusual, finding a good-looking
girl like you alone like this.

845
01:08:31,157 --> 01:08:36,060
Listen, are you sure you shouldn't
do something about the bridge?

846
01:08:36,796 --> 01:08:37,888
What bridge?

847
01:08:43,269 --> 01:08:44,361
You're right.

848
01:08:48,607 --> 01:08:50,336
I have to get going.

849
01:08:59,251 --> 01:09:00,878
Get him out of there. Come on.

850
01:09:01,087 --> 01:09:02,714
Get him out quick!

851
01:09:02,922 --> 01:09:05,652
Get him away. That thing's gonna go.

852
01:09:20,473 --> 01:09:21,963
Everybody okay?

853
01:09:23,275 --> 01:09:24,537
What can I do to help?

854
01:09:24,744 --> 01:09:26,234
Not much of anything now.

855
01:09:26,445 --> 01:09:29,005
If only you'd gotten here
a minute sooner.

856
01:10:44,256 --> 01:10:46,918
"At a special session
of the General Assembly...

857
01:10:47,126 --> 01:10:50,357
...178 countries voted
to censure Superman...

858
01:10:50,563 --> 01:10:52,997
...with only Colombia abstaining."

859
01:10:53,199 --> 01:10:54,666
I can tell you one thing.

860
01:10:54,867 --> 01:10:58,701
He wasn't so mean and nasty
the other day in Smallville.

861
01:10:58,904 --> 01:11:01,338
In fact, he was so full of niceness...

862
01:11:01,540 --> 01:11:03,872
...I hated laying
that big chunk of...

863
01:11:05,611 --> 01:11:06,509
Kryptonite.

864
01:11:06,712 --> 01:11:11,012
Don't you see? That stuff we ran off
in the lab wasn't a failure after all.

865
01:11:11,217 --> 01:11:14,152
Right after Gus gave it to him,
he started to turn into...

866
01:11:14,353 --> 01:11:16,446
...an ornery, evil, malicious,
selfish...

867
01:11:16,655 --> 01:11:18,555
- A normal person.
- Yes.

868
01:11:19,191 --> 01:11:22,718
And now that Superman is out
of the nice-guy business...

869
01:11:22,928 --> 01:11:24,555
We can get to work on that oil.

870
01:11:48,354 --> 01:11:52,484
<i>And now, the supreme moment,</i>
<i>as the last runner...</i>

871
01:11:52,691 --> 01:11:56,593
<i>... the one given the great honor</i>
<i>of lighting the ceremonial flame...</i>

872
01:11:56,795 --> 01:12:00,925
<i>... runs the last leg of a marathon</i>
<i>that began seven days ago...</i>

873
01:12:01,133 --> 01:12:05,866
<i>... as this torch has been passed</i>
<i>from athlete to athlete...</i>

874
01:12:06,071 --> 01:12:08,767
<i>... for 970 miles...</i>

875
01:12:08,974 --> 01:12:10,771
<i>... across the country.</i>

876
01:12:51,984 --> 01:12:55,283
How can he say that pure categories
have no objective meaning...

877
01:12:55,487 --> 01:12:58,285
...in transcendental logic?
What about synthetic unity?

878
01:13:01,193 --> 01:13:02,956
Hi, honey! Am I in your way?

879
01:13:03,162 --> 01:13:04,993
Stick around, you might
learn something.

880
01:13:05,197 --> 01:13:06,061
Hi, Lorelei.

881
01:13:06,298 --> 01:13:09,893
All the oil tankers in the world
are controlled by computers.

882
01:13:10,102 --> 01:13:12,969
They tell them where to go,
how much oil to pick up...

883
01:13:13,172 --> 01:13:14,867
...and where to deliver it.

884
01:13:15,140 --> 01:13:16,903
Don't they have captains
on these ships?

885
01:13:17,109 --> 01:13:18,474
Yes, but they don't need to.

886
01:13:18,677 --> 01:13:21,976
That's a throwback to some
sentimental, seafaring baloney.

887
01:13:22,181 --> 01:13:25,912
You will command the tankers to sail
toward a 50-mile area...

888
01:13:26,118 --> 01:13:27,881
...in the middle of
the Atlantic Ocean.

889
01:13:28,087 --> 01:13:29,748
And do what?

890
01:13:29,955 --> 01:13:32,150
And do nothing.

891
01:13:32,358 --> 01:13:34,553
Just sit there.

892
01:13:35,761 --> 01:13:38,662
How are all the people
gonna get their oil?

893
01:13:39,832 --> 01:13:42,198
You catch on fast, old buddy.

894
01:13:44,970 --> 01:13:48,133
Every oil pump in America is run by...

895
01:13:48,340 --> 01:13:51,070
- Computers. I know.
- Will you stop interrupting?!

896
01:13:51,276 --> 01:13:52,436
I'm sorry.

897
01:13:52,778 --> 01:13:56,544
You will command the pumps
to stop pumping.

898
01:13:56,749 --> 01:14:00,685
Then I want you to program
one special command...

899
01:14:00,886 --> 01:14:02,945
...into all these systems.

900
01:14:03,155 --> 01:14:05,919
Tell them these orders
are irreversible.

901
01:14:06,125 --> 01:14:09,891
So it would be impossible
for anybody to switch them back.

902
01:14:10,095 --> 01:14:11,926
Can you do this for me, old buddy?

903
01:14:12,531 --> 01:14:14,362
Old pal?

904
01:14:21,740 --> 01:14:24,140
You know, you get your way
all the time.

905
01:14:25,344 --> 01:14:27,107
And it's not right.

906
01:14:29,548 --> 01:14:31,641
I want to know when I get a taste.

907
01:14:38,123 --> 01:14:42,389
I think you've already had
a taste of freedom, haven't you?

908
01:14:42,594 --> 01:14:45,119
Or would you prefer jail?

909
01:14:45,330 --> 01:14:47,161
You can't run that jail number on me.

910
01:14:47,533 --> 01:14:51,094
Because I know I mean more to you
out here doing things for you...

911
01:14:51,303 --> 01:14:53,965
...than sitting in jail
doing nothing for nobody.

912
01:14:55,808 --> 01:14:56,740
I see.

913
01:14:56,942 --> 01:14:58,842
What do you want?

914
01:15:05,184 --> 01:15:07,652
What? A waste basket?

915
01:15:07,853 --> 01:15:09,946
No. These are plans.

916
01:15:10,856 --> 01:15:12,346
Blueprints.

917
01:15:12,925 --> 01:15:14,950
- For what?
- A computer.

918
01:15:15,160 --> 01:15:17,958
- We've already got computers.
- No, not like this.

919
01:15:18,163 --> 01:15:21,655
There's not a computer like this
in the whole world, anyplace.

920
01:15:22,267 --> 01:15:24,098
It doesn't exist.
You see...

921
01:15:24,436 --> 01:15:25,698
...we have to build it.

922
01:15:26,271 --> 01:15:27,295
What will it do?

923
01:15:27,673 --> 01:15:29,504
Anything I tell it.

924
01:15:30,075 --> 01:15:32,202
What will it do for me?

925
01:15:32,411 --> 01:15:36,643
For you? It will do anything you
tell me to tell it to do for you.

926
01:15:43,088 --> 01:15:44,646
Tell me.

927
01:15:46,558 --> 01:15:49,857
First of all, if anyone attacks
this machine or anything...

928
01:15:50,062 --> 01:15:51,962
...the computer counterattacks it.

929
01:15:52,164 --> 01:15:55,156
It finds their witnesses
and wipes them out.

930
01:15:55,734 --> 01:15:56,758
<i>Right, old buddy.</i>

931
01:15:56,969 --> 01:16:00,735
<i>You deal with my oil</i>
<i>and I'll build you your machine.</i>

932
01:16:04,409 --> 01:16:06,070
<i>Okay, I'll do it.</i>

933
01:16:06,278 --> 01:16:09,805
<i>But I'm not so sure about</i>
<i>this irreversible business.</i>

934
01:16:26,965 --> 01:16:29,627
They all kind of went...
What the hell?

935
01:16:33,038 --> 01:16:35,506
That's it. The last tanker.

936
01:16:36,241 --> 01:16:39,108
They're all mine now.
All mine.

937
01:16:41,380 --> 01:16:43,610
Not quite.

938
01:16:43,816 --> 01:16:46,284
What's that in
the upper-middle quadrant?

939
01:16:47,319 --> 01:16:48,786
It's a tanker.

940
01:16:50,923 --> 01:16:52,891
And it's going the wrong way.

941
01:17:03,635 --> 01:17:04,795
Skipper?

942
01:17:05,003 --> 01:17:07,665
There it is again.
"Proceed immediately to...

943
01:17:07,873 --> 01:17:10,899
...latitude 30 north,
longitude 45 west.

944
01:17:12,678 --> 01:17:14,305
There await further orders."

945
01:17:14,513 --> 01:17:16,640
Hell, that's the middle
of the Atlantic.

946
01:17:16,849 --> 01:17:19,750
I'm not taking my ship there
to "await further orders"...

947
01:17:19,952 --> 01:17:21,510
...no matter what that says.

948
01:17:21,720 --> 01:17:25,315
We're supposed to go to Metropolis,
and we're going to Metropolis.

949
01:17:25,524 --> 01:17:26,752
All right.

950
01:17:39,171 --> 01:17:40,468
That's where she is.

951
01:17:40,672 --> 01:17:42,731
Come on, get it up there.

952
01:17:44,176 --> 01:17:45,165
<i>Miss?</i>

953
01:17:46,111 --> 01:17:48,341
<i>Miss, can you hear me?</i>

954
01:17:48,547 --> 01:17:51,209
<i>Listen, we are here to help you.</i>

955
01:17:51,416 --> 01:17:54,874
<i>Don't jump. I repeat, do not jump!</i>

956
01:17:56,488 --> 01:17:57,887
Thought you'd never come.

957
01:17:58,757 --> 01:18:01,487
Don't expect me to save you.
I don't do that anymore.

958
01:18:01,693 --> 01:18:02,751
Don't worry.

959
01:18:02,961 --> 01:18:05,657
I'm long past saving.

960
01:18:12,771 --> 01:18:14,534
Don't let me keep you from anything.

961
01:18:15,207 --> 01:18:16,765
I'm not in a rush.

962
01:18:22,648 --> 01:18:24,616
What did you have in mind?

963
01:18:24,983 --> 01:18:26,507
Lots of things.

964
01:18:26,718 --> 01:18:28,015
Oh, yeah?

965
01:18:31,123 --> 01:18:34,024
If you'll just do me
one little favor first.

966
01:18:34,226 --> 01:18:35,591
What's that?

967
01:18:38,363 --> 01:18:40,593
See, there's this little boat...

968
01:18:40,799 --> 01:18:44,462
...and it's not going where
it's supposed to go and...

969
01:19:21,139 --> 01:19:22,766
Stop all engines!

970
01:19:23,775 --> 01:19:25,470
Stop all engines!

971
01:20:18,830 --> 01:20:20,354
Hi.

972
01:20:35,914 --> 01:20:38,314
How about a little après-ski?

973
01:20:49,294 --> 01:20:50,693
Champagne?

974
01:21:14,453 --> 01:21:16,284
Take your turn like everybody else!

975
01:21:16,488 --> 01:21:18,547
Stop it!

976
01:21:21,293 --> 01:21:23,318
He's coming over here, Martha.

977
01:21:26,898 --> 01:21:28,297
Don't you do that!

978
01:21:38,176 --> 01:21:40,144
Hit him with your handbag!

979
01:21:43,715 --> 01:21:47,048
Help me! Please, help me.
Somebody's beating up my husband.

980
01:21:47,252 --> 01:21:50,847
- I've gotta call the police.
- Jack, go with her, okay?

981
01:21:51,923 --> 01:21:54,414
The third one today,
and at night it's worse.

982
01:21:54,626 --> 01:21:56,423
Somebody's behind this.

983
01:21:56,628 --> 01:21:58,425
You can't say there's no oil.

984
01:21:58,630 --> 01:22:00,928
You can't say someone's
not getting rich off this.

985
01:22:01,133 --> 01:22:02,964
Someone's always getting rich.

986
01:22:03,168 --> 01:22:05,159
You know who suffers?
The small guy.

987
01:22:05,370 --> 01:22:08,601
<i>The east coast gets the brunt</i>
<i>of the spill.</i>

988
01:22:51,316 --> 01:22:53,841
No, I cannot go out with you tonight.

989
01:22:54,286 --> 01:22:55,810
I'm busy tomorrow night too.

990
01:22:56,021 --> 01:22:57,784
Oh, yeah? Doing what?

991
01:22:58,223 --> 01:23:00,054
I'll think of something. Look...

992
01:23:00,258 --> 01:23:02,886
...I gotta go. Ricky needs me.

993
01:23:03,595 --> 01:23:06,723
Brad, please stop calling me.
I've told you!

994
01:23:06,932 --> 01:23:08,957
Well, you listen to me, huh?

995
01:23:09,167 --> 01:23:11,135
You better start appreciating
ol' Brad.

996
01:23:11,570 --> 01:23:13,094
What else you got in Smallville?

997
01:23:19,044 --> 01:23:21,569
What else have I got in Smallville?

998
01:23:23,114 --> 01:23:25,105
I think I got the right answer.

999
01:23:25,784 --> 01:23:27,183
So do I.

1000
01:23:36,261 --> 01:23:39,958
Smallville Airport, what flights
do you have to Metropolis tomorrow?

1001
01:23:45,604 --> 01:23:48,129
- Where do I put this?
- Over there.

1002
01:23:49,841 --> 01:23:52,901
- Where do you want this?
- Load it up there.

1003
01:24:30,915 --> 01:24:32,075
Just leave him alone.

1004
01:24:53,838 --> 01:24:55,965
I can't get through.
Something's happening.

1005
01:24:56,174 --> 01:24:57,971
Hey, look! Superman's drunk!

1006
01:24:58,176 --> 01:25:00,337
I want to see what's happening here.

1007
01:25:05,450 --> 01:25:07,577
- Thank you.
- It's a disgrace, that's what.

1008
01:25:07,786 --> 01:25:10,584
Nobody's ever gonna trust
that creep again.

1009
01:25:10,789 --> 01:25:12,222
He's washed up.

1010
01:25:15,727 --> 01:25:18,423
What are you looking at? Huh?

1011
01:25:18,830 --> 01:25:22,027
Excuse me. Superman?
It's me, Ricky.

1012
01:25:22,233 --> 01:25:23,894
Ricky from Smallville.

1013
01:25:24,135 --> 01:25:25,864
Tell them you won't hurt anybody!

1014
01:25:26,071 --> 01:25:27,231
He's changed.

1015
01:25:27,439 --> 01:25:30,067
No! Maybe he's just sick.

1016
01:25:30,275 --> 01:25:32,140
Superman, please get better!

1017
01:25:32,344 --> 01:25:33,777
He's not listening to you.

1018
01:25:33,978 --> 01:25:37,778
Yes, he is. He can hear me.
He's got super-hearing.

1019
01:25:37,982 --> 01:25:40,576
Superman, you're just in a slump!

1020
01:25:40,785 --> 01:25:42,514
You'll be great again!

1021
01:25:42,721 --> 01:25:44,211
You can do it, Superman!

1022
01:25:44,422 --> 01:25:47,391
<i>Superman, you can hear me, can't you?</i>

1023
01:25:47,592 --> 01:25:50,152
<i>Superman, you're just in a slump.</i>

1024
01:25:50,362 --> 01:25:53,923
<i>You'll be great again.</i>
<i>You can do it, Superman.</i>

1025
01:26:17,355 --> 01:26:18,344
He's gone nuts!

1026
01:26:20,291 --> 01:26:21,280
Come on!

1027
01:27:48,246 --> 01:27:50,214
I can give as good as I get.

1028
01:27:51,349 --> 01:27:54,341
Yeah? All right, come on!
Come on!

1029
01:27:54,552 --> 01:27:56,247
Come on! Come on!

1030
01:28:21,746 --> 01:28:24,374
What's the matter, Kent?
Too warm for you, huh?

1031
01:28:26,518 --> 01:28:29,282
Come on, chicken! Come and get me.

1032
01:28:29,487 --> 01:28:31,751
You've been on my nerves
a long time!

1033
01:28:53,645 --> 01:28:55,738
You always wanted to fly, Kent.

1034
01:28:55,947 --> 01:28:57,175
Now's your chance.

1035
01:33:51,275 --> 01:33:52,264
Skipper!

1036
01:34:07,425 --> 01:34:09,825
God, would you look at that!

1037
01:34:57,241 --> 01:34:59,869
<i>Miss Lorelei Ambrosia</i>
<i>isn't at home right now.</i>

1038
01:35:00,077 --> 01:35:02,272
<i>But if you'd care</i>
<i>to leave a message...</i>

1039
01:35:02,480 --> 01:35:04,812
<i>... why not deliver it to her...</i>

1040
01:35:05,016 --> 01:35:05,846
<i>... in person?</i>

1041
01:35:06,050 --> 01:35:09,417
<i>So you've finally shown</i>
<i>your true colors.</i>

1042
01:35:09,620 --> 01:35:13,886
<i>Well, if you're looking for us,</i>
<i>here's where you'll find us.</i>

1043
01:35:14,091 --> 01:35:15,786
<i>Do drop in.</i>

1044
01:35:22,400 --> 01:35:24,027
This is fun!

1045
01:35:24,468 --> 01:35:26,493
Fun? The fun's just starting.

1046
01:35:27,104 --> 01:35:29,937
Wait till Superman finds us,
then you'll see some fun.

1047
01:35:30,141 --> 01:35:32,507
Wait, you gonna mess with Superman?

1048
01:35:32,810 --> 01:35:36,803
Let's go. I want to be ready for him
when he falls into our trap.

1049
01:35:37,114 --> 01:35:40,948
I just don't see why you can't
balloon down like the rest of us.

1050
01:35:41,152 --> 01:35:42,244
Well...

1051
01:35:44,088 --> 01:35:45,180
No way. Uh-uh.

1052
01:35:45,389 --> 01:35:47,880
I just don't believe a man can fly.

1053
01:36:05,076 --> 01:36:07,067
Watch out, horsy!

1054
01:36:16,821 --> 01:36:18,914
Don't, don't, don't.

1055
01:36:19,123 --> 01:36:21,523
Just don't try to fly.

1056
01:36:21,792 --> 01:36:23,225
Don't try to fly!

1057
01:36:36,474 --> 01:36:38,908
Will you get out of my way!

1058
01:36:57,728 --> 01:37:00,060
- Hurry! Hurry up!
- I am hurrying.

1059
01:37:05,636 --> 01:37:07,934
- I can't see anything.
- Turn on the light.

1060
01:37:08,139 --> 01:37:10,869
- Where's the light switch?
- Where do you usually find it?

1061
01:37:11,075 --> 01:37:13,373
I don't know.
I guess I'll check the doorway.

1062
01:37:13,577 --> 01:37:17,445
God, it's pitch-black in here.
Oh, that's better.

1063
01:37:20,918 --> 01:37:23,648
Wow, what a jukebox!

1064
01:37:23,854 --> 01:37:25,788
I told you, didn't I?

1065
01:37:25,990 --> 01:37:28,254
There. The ultimate computer!

1066
01:37:35,433 --> 01:37:39,199
It does everything a computer can do
and 1000 things none of them can!

1067
01:37:39,403 --> 01:37:40,802
Let's give it a dry run.

1068
01:37:41,005 --> 01:37:42,939
Wait. We've gotta wait for Gus.

1069
01:37:43,140 --> 01:37:44,437
Who needs Gus?

1070
01:37:44,642 --> 01:37:47,975
- Only he can operate it.
- Like fish, he is!

1071
01:37:48,179 --> 01:37:51,410
I know enough about computers
to put a Ph.D. To shame.

1072
01:37:51,615 --> 01:37:54,175
Come now, brother dear,
you didn't think...

1073
01:37:54,385 --> 01:37:57,047
...I'd let that little man
run the show, did you?

1074
01:37:57,421 --> 01:37:59,446
Why don't peons tidy up
when they're done?

1075
01:37:59,657 --> 01:38:02,455
Come on, Bubba, it's showtime.

1076
01:38:05,896 --> 01:38:08,558
Engage those buttons to
activate the alpha circuit...

1077
01:38:08,766 --> 01:38:10,131
...and lock the modular grid.

1078
01:38:10,334 --> 01:38:15,237
You! Activate circuits
29 through W-7...

1079
01:38:15,439 --> 01:38:19,500
...and start full-power coordinates
on exterior defensive systems.

1080
01:38:19,710 --> 01:38:22,611
In other words, push this red button.

1081
01:38:23,447 --> 01:38:25,438
How did you know about that?

1082
01:38:43,400 --> 01:38:44,389
He's here!

1083
01:38:44,602 --> 01:38:46,661
Let's give him
something to worry about.

1084
01:38:48,672 --> 01:38:50,139
Now, let's see...

1085
01:38:50,574 --> 01:38:52,974
Tracking systems locked.

1086
01:39:18,469 --> 01:39:20,460
Let the games begin.

1087
01:39:21,472 --> 01:39:23,064
Don't tense up now, honey.

1088
01:39:55,606 --> 01:39:58,473
Come on, Bubba,
you're wasting your rockets.

1089
01:40:05,916 --> 01:40:08,009
Come on, Superman!

1090
01:40:09,086 --> 01:40:10,951
Let him have it, Ross.

1091
01:40:17,828 --> 01:40:19,659
Bubba, keep firing.

1092
01:40:19,863 --> 01:40:22,491
Keep him occupied
while I get the MX ready.

1093
01:40:49,760 --> 01:40:51,955
What the hell is going on?

1094
01:41:00,037 --> 01:41:03,734
Keep your rockets coming. He won't
notice the missile till too late!

1095
01:41:11,915 --> 01:41:14,076
So much for your catlike reflexes.

1096
01:41:24,561 --> 01:41:25,391
Oh, God!

1097
01:41:36,106 --> 01:41:39,041
No more. Look, you sit.

1098
01:41:39,243 --> 01:41:41,040
Sit, sit!

1099
01:41:44,748 --> 01:41:45,874
Help!

1100
01:41:46,617 --> 01:41:47,447
Hello!

1101
01:41:47,951 --> 01:41:49,782
Get to, jackass!

1102
01:41:51,021 --> 01:41:52,318
That's him out of the way.

1103
01:41:52,523 --> 01:41:56,619
Sis, how would you like to control
all the world's weapons systems?

1104
01:41:57,494 --> 01:41:58,688
Baby!

1105
01:41:58,896 --> 01:42:00,363
It's Daddy!

1106
01:42:01,432 --> 01:42:03,627
Hey, what are you doing with my baby?

1107
01:42:04,068 --> 01:42:08,232
Gus, old buddy, genius.
Come up and join the fun.

1108
01:42:19,149 --> 01:42:22,710
He's still coming.
Arm the inner defenses.

1109
01:42:27,157 --> 01:42:28,647
All right, the game's over.

1110
01:42:29,326 --> 01:42:30,315
Hi, honey.

1111
01:42:30,894 --> 01:42:32,054
I don't know you, lady.

1112
01:42:34,098 --> 01:42:35,326
But the other night...

1113
01:42:37,935 --> 01:42:40,130
I'm sorry, but that wasn't me.

1114
01:42:40,337 --> 01:42:41,668
That guy's gone.

1115
01:42:43,440 --> 01:42:44,907
And you're next, Webster.

1116
01:42:46,043 --> 01:42:49,444
Never underestimate
the power of computers.

1117
01:42:49,747 --> 01:42:51,078
How do you like it?

1118
01:42:51,281 --> 01:42:53,806
I think it's typical
of people like you, Webster.

1119
01:42:54,118 --> 01:42:57,485
Instead of helping others,
you four just help yourselves.

1120
01:42:57,688 --> 01:42:58,848
Four...

1121
01:42:59,056 --> 01:42:59,988
...of you?

1122
01:43:00,190 --> 01:43:02,283
You mean, us? Four? Wait...

1123
01:43:02,493 --> 01:43:04,154
Hey, man!

1124
01:43:04,361 --> 01:43:08,024
That's only his last name.
He likes to be called "Superman."

1125
01:43:08,799 --> 01:43:11,427
See, I'm not with them, Superman.

1126
01:43:12,035 --> 01:43:13,434
You could've fooled me.

1127
01:43:21,779 --> 01:43:23,269
That's very good.

1128
01:43:25,749 --> 01:43:29,241
Let's see how long
he can carry on without any air.

1129
01:43:51,375 --> 01:43:53,343
He's still coming!
He's going to get me!

1130
01:43:53,544 --> 01:43:54,636
Don't bet on it!

1131
01:44:07,324 --> 01:44:08,689
You're hurting him.

1132
01:44:12,796 --> 01:44:14,855
- That's Kryptonite!
- Yes.

1133
01:44:15,065 --> 01:44:17,590
- This time we got it right!
- You're a genius.

1134
01:44:18,135 --> 01:44:21,696
You've invented a machine
that can find anybody's weak spot.

1135
01:44:22,239 --> 01:44:23,729
Congratulations, old buddy.

1136
01:44:23,941 --> 01:44:27,172
You'll go down in history
as the man who killed Superman!

1137
01:44:27,377 --> 01:44:28,605
I'm... No.

1138
01:44:29,313 --> 01:44:30,610
Superman!

1139
01:44:30,814 --> 01:44:31,678
No!

1140
01:44:32,983 --> 01:44:35,178
- Where do you think you're going?
- Never mind.

1141
01:44:35,385 --> 01:44:38,252
- Turn the power up.
- Don't you think he's had enough?

1142
01:44:42,092 --> 01:44:43,389
Turn it up!

1143
01:44:43,594 --> 01:44:45,687
Power! More power!

1144
01:45:07,117 --> 01:45:09,813
Seventy-five. Current 7.75.

1145
01:45:13,891 --> 01:45:18,658
There's a current level of 7
that is not supposed to be on bar...

1146
01:45:18,862 --> 01:45:20,420
Oh, here it is!

1147
01:45:47,190 --> 01:45:48,122
What's going on?

1148
01:45:48,992 --> 01:45:50,823
I don't know. The power's gone.

1149
01:45:51,295 --> 01:45:53,195
Gus must have pulled the plug out.

1150
01:45:53,664 --> 01:45:55,131
It worked.

1151
01:45:55,332 --> 01:45:57,664
It worked! I got it!

1152
01:46:01,705 --> 01:46:03,172
What have you got?

1153
01:46:05,676 --> 01:46:07,439
- Give me that screw.
- This screw?

1154
01:46:07,644 --> 01:46:09,771
- That screw.
- Never!

1155
01:46:39,276 --> 01:46:40,368
What?

1156
01:46:43,213 --> 01:46:44,680
Holy!

1157
01:46:45,248 --> 01:46:47,409
No! Make it stop!

1158
01:46:49,019 --> 01:46:50,486
I can't! It's out of control!

1159
01:46:50,687 --> 01:46:53,850
But how?
Where's it getting the power from?

1160
01:46:57,427 --> 01:46:59,622
It's feeding itself.

1161
01:46:59,830 --> 01:47:01,092
It wants to live!

1162
01:47:23,987 --> 01:47:26,148
It's this thing here.
We'll go to the zoo.

1163
01:47:26,356 --> 01:47:29,621
I'll do that tomorrow,
and then we'll go on to the...

1164
01:47:30,727 --> 01:47:33,252
- What's happening?
- It's okay, Ricky.

1165
01:47:33,530 --> 01:47:34,690
Put the lights on!

1166
01:47:54,651 --> 01:47:56,676
Stop it! You're killing him!

1167
01:47:58,488 --> 01:47:59,853
Stop it!

1168
01:48:12,302 --> 01:48:13,735
Hey. Put me down!

1169
01:48:30,987 --> 01:48:34,081
Don't leave us alone
in here! Superman!

1170
01:48:38,595 --> 01:48:39,425
Oh, I get it.

1171
01:48:39,629 --> 01:48:43,292
The coaxial energy shaft is engaging
the grid source factor. Right.

1172
01:48:43,500 --> 01:48:45,331
We're through, pugface.
I'm splitting.

1173
01:48:45,535 --> 01:48:47,093
Hey, wait a minute!

1174
01:48:49,639 --> 01:48:52,301
Girls. Girls, come out of there!

1175
01:49:10,861 --> 01:49:11,987
Sis?

1176
01:49:15,832 --> 01:49:17,129
Oh, my God.

1177
01:49:24,741 --> 01:49:26,003
What is that?

1178
01:49:41,424 --> 01:49:43,551
Sis, it's your Bubba!

1179
01:50:21,665 --> 01:50:23,292
Help me. Help!

1180
01:50:25,502 --> 01:50:26,799
Superman!

1181
01:50:29,940 --> 01:50:30,929
Honey!

1182
01:50:31,141 --> 01:50:35,009
Honey, I'm stuck here! Help!
What about me?

1183
01:50:46,223 --> 01:50:47,212
Look out!

1184
01:52:56,519 --> 01:52:57,713
Bubba?

1185
01:53:44,067 --> 01:53:45,796
Thank you, brother.

1186
01:53:52,842 --> 01:53:54,537
Regular or premium?

1187
01:53:54,744 --> 01:53:58,840
She hasn't had a drink in so long,
give her a tankful of the good stuff.

1188
01:54:00,817 --> 01:54:01,749
How you doing?

1189
01:54:01,951 --> 01:54:05,045
Please don't talk to me.
I'm having enough trouble hanging on.

1190
01:54:05,255 --> 01:54:08,019
Okay, we'll go slow.
You're perfectly safe.

1191
01:54:08,625 --> 01:54:10,024
I won't argue with you.

1192
01:54:10,226 --> 01:54:13,320
Any man who can trick my machine
can do anything.

1193
01:54:13,530 --> 01:54:15,225
How did you beat my defenses?

1194
01:54:15,432 --> 01:54:18,833
Those defenses are good as long as
it didn't know it's in trouble.

1195
01:54:19,069 --> 01:54:22,561
This time it didn't see the danger.
I went in with plain old acid.

1196
01:54:22,772 --> 01:54:26,401
It didn't know that when acid gets hot,
it'll eat through anything.

1197
01:54:26,943 --> 01:54:28,535
Watch the trees.

1198
01:54:29,112 --> 01:54:32,172
I guess it died of acid indigestion.

1199
01:54:33,450 --> 01:54:36,010
But what's gonna happen
to Ross and the ladies?

1200
01:54:36,219 --> 01:54:39,746
They'll have to see the police.
It's not your problem anymore.

1201
01:54:41,291 --> 01:54:42,815
Are we in Metropolis yet?

1202
01:54:43,026 --> 01:54:46,120
Nope. I'm just gonna make
a little stop. Right over there.

1203
01:54:53,803 --> 01:54:55,464
We're on the ground, Gus.

1204
01:54:56,506 --> 01:54:58,497
- You okay, Supe?
- I'm fine.

1205
01:54:58,708 --> 01:54:59,868
Excuse me.

1206
01:55:04,247 --> 01:55:06,010
Can you guys spare one of these?

1207
01:55:06,916 --> 01:55:09,612
- Sure, Superman.
- It is Superman, isn't it?

1208
01:55:09,819 --> 01:55:11,810
Are you kidding? Is that?

1209
01:55:12,021 --> 01:55:14,751
Didn't you see us fly out of the sky?

1210
01:55:15,959 --> 01:55:20,521
We're the only two men who can fly.
"Is it Superman?"

1211
01:55:20,730 --> 01:55:21,560
Just right.

1212
01:55:23,099 --> 01:55:24,123
Okay, let's go.

1213
01:55:24,334 --> 01:55:27,394
I was afraid you'd say that.
I thought I'd take the bus.

1214
01:55:27,904 --> 01:55:31,237
Well, suit yourself.
Does your boss have a computer here?

1215
01:55:31,608 --> 01:55:34,509
Yeah, he got a little bitty one
about that big.

1216
01:55:34,711 --> 01:55:38,340
You tell him he can do a lot worse
than to give Gus Gorman here a job.

1217
01:55:40,583 --> 01:55:42,175
Wow, thank you, Supe.

1218
01:55:42,619 --> 01:55:43,551
Take care.

1219
01:55:45,455 --> 01:55:46,945
I'll see you around.

1220
01:55:53,029 --> 01:55:54,121
So long.

1221
01:55:57,167 --> 01:55:58,862
Take it easy, man.

1222
01:56:00,236 --> 01:56:04,468
Well, you got good references,
so if you want that job...

1223
01:56:08,511 --> 01:56:11,275
Nah, this is not for me.
I think I'll take that bus.

1224
01:56:11,481 --> 01:56:13,381
Where's the bus station?

1225
01:56:13,583 --> 01:56:16,177
Yeah, about 9, 10 miles
over there.

1226
01:56:16,386 --> 01:56:18,911
Nine or 10 miles.

1227
01:56:21,024 --> 01:56:23,083
Hey. You really flew with him?

1228
01:56:23,293 --> 01:56:26,319
Superman?
Have you ever seen Superman before?

1229
01:56:29,666 --> 01:56:33,124
Oh, you don't know about me and him?
Me and Superman?

1230
01:56:38,308 --> 01:56:40,640
Yeah, we go way back together.

1231
01:56:40,843 --> 01:56:43,505
We always, usually, sometimes, we...

1232
01:56:44,948 --> 01:56:46,711
Nine or 10 miles?

1233
01:56:47,250 --> 01:56:49,184
I think I'll walk.

1234
01:56:49,552 --> 01:56:50,951
Yeah, I'll walk.

1235
01:56:57,794 --> 01:56:59,022
Clark.

1236
01:56:59,362 --> 01:57:02,354
What a nice surprise! Come in.

1237
01:57:02,565 --> 01:57:03,759
Hi, Mr. Kent.

1238
01:57:04,334 --> 01:57:06,768
- Guess who Mom's having dinner with?
- Who?

1239
01:57:06,970 --> 01:57:08,335
Superman!

1240
01:57:08,905 --> 01:57:11,100
Yeah, that's what I came to tell you.

1241
01:57:11,307 --> 01:57:13,207
Superman said to tell you he's sorry...

1242
01:57:13,409 --> 01:57:16,970
...but he's run into a problem
and he can't make dinner with you.

1243
01:57:17,180 --> 01:57:19,546
I guess he misses a lot of dinners.

1244
01:57:20,717 --> 01:57:22,582
Would you mind settling for me?

1245
01:57:22,785 --> 01:57:24,047
Any day.

1246
01:57:24,988 --> 01:57:26,216
I'll get my things.

1247
01:57:28,157 --> 01:57:31,649
Lana, I was talking
to Superman the other day.

1248
01:57:31,861 --> 01:57:35,627
You know, he and I, we talk a lot.

1249
01:57:36,132 --> 01:57:39,465
He felt badly about you having
to pawn your diamond ring.

1250
01:57:42,572 --> 01:57:44,039
Well, he found...

1251
01:57:45,275 --> 01:57:48,472
He found this one just lying around.

1252
01:57:49,779 --> 01:57:52,213
He wanted you to have this.

1253
01:57:59,088 --> 01:58:01,022
Wow, a ring from Superman!

1254
01:58:02,191 --> 01:58:04,318
- It's okay. I got it.
- Sorry.

1255
01:58:06,429 --> 01:58:08,761
- Oh, Clark.
- It's okay.

1256
01:58:08,965 --> 01:58:10,227
It fits.

1257
01:58:10,767 --> 01:58:12,098
It looks really pretty.

1258
01:58:12,302 --> 01:58:13,360
Thank you.

1259
01:58:16,506 --> 01:58:17,564
Brad.

1260
01:58:18,041 --> 01:58:19,065
Son of a bitch.

1261
01:58:20,910 --> 01:58:22,844
Kent, I hate you.

1262
01:58:23,780 --> 01:58:25,680
I've always hated you.

1263
01:58:26,215 --> 01:58:28,012
- You know why?
- No.

1264
01:58:28,217 --> 01:58:29,775
- Because you're nice.
- Not really.

1265
01:58:29,986 --> 01:58:31,453
And nice guys finish last.

1266
01:58:43,232 --> 01:58:44,859
Lois, I've got to hand it to you.

1267
01:58:45,068 --> 01:58:47,468
Who else could turn
a vacation into a story...

1268
01:58:47,670 --> 01:58:50,639
...that'll blow the lid off
of corruption in the Caribbean?

1269
01:58:50,840 --> 01:58:54,139
I knew I was onto something
when that taxi driver kidnapped me.

1270
01:58:54,344 --> 01:58:56,335
Lois, you're terrific.

1271
01:58:56,546 --> 01:59:00,380
I have to be.
Seems I've got some new competition.

1272
01:59:01,851 --> 01:59:04,376
The story that you wrote
on the class reunion?

1273
01:59:04,587 --> 01:59:06,384
- I thought it was terrific.
- Thanks.

1274
01:59:06,589 --> 01:59:10,184
And fascinating. I liked the part
about the little girl back home.

1275
01:59:10,393 --> 01:59:12,623
I'll take you to lunch
and you tell me about it.

1276
01:59:13,496 --> 01:59:16,761
I'd love to, but I'm having lunch
with Mr. White's new secretary.

1277
01:59:16,966 --> 01:59:17,955
- Hi, Lana.
- Hi, Clark.

1278
01:59:18,167 --> 01:59:22,467
Lois, say hello to Lana Lang.
Smallville's newest gift to Metropolis.

1279
01:59:22,672 --> 01:59:25,106
Glad to meet you.
I like your writing a lot.

1280
01:59:25,475 --> 01:59:26,567
Thank you.

1281
01:59:27,543 --> 01:59:28,874
I like your sparkler a lot.

1282
01:59:29,078 --> 01:59:32,013
Me too. I couldn't believe it
when Clark gave it to me.

1283
01:59:33,483 --> 01:59:35,212
Clark gave it to you?

1284
01:59:38,354 --> 01:59:39,719
Mr. White.

1285
01:59:39,922 --> 01:59:43,050
Mr. White, look what I've got for you.

1286
01:59:43,259 --> 01:59:46,160
People, I am in love
with this machine!

1287
01:59:46,362 --> 01:59:50,958
Excuse me, but I have a couple
of errands to run before lunch.

1288
01:59:51,167 --> 01:59:53,897
- Go ahead, Mr. White.
- Where's the handle?

1289
01:59:54,103 --> 01:59:57,368
There is no handle.
You just push the button.
