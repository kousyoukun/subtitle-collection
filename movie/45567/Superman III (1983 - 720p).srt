1
00:00:16,182 --> 00:00:17,683
Next, please.

2
00:00:18,268 --> 00:00:19,643
Come on, come on.

3
00:00:20,103 --> 00:00:21,270
Next.

4
00:00:21,646 --> 00:00:22,771
Name.

5
00:00:22,939 --> 00:00:24,648
Gus Gorman.

6
00:00:32,449 --> 00:00:34,783
Ah, yes. August Gorman.

7
00:00:34,951 --> 00:00:37,244
Have you looked for work this week ?

8
00:00:37,787 --> 00:00:40,164
- Yes.
- What kind ?

9
00:00:42,417 --> 00:00:45,294
- Kitchen technician.
- Dishwasher. Any luck ?

10
00:00:46,171 --> 00:00:47,212
No, but...

11
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:51,091
Mr. Gorman, according to our records,
you've been unemployed for 36 weeks.

12
00:00:51,301 --> 00:00:52,426
No, it's 35.

13
00:00:52,594 --> 00:00:54,470
Not counting this week.

14
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:59,099
You secured employment in June as
a messenger and were discharged after...

15
00:00:59,267 --> 00:01:02,061
- one day for losing...
- No, they said I lost it.

16
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:05,314
I did not lose it !
It was stolen by a pickpocket.

17
00:01:05,482 --> 00:01:06,940
A television set ?

18
00:01:07,192 --> 00:01:10,819
It was a teeny-tiny, teeny-weensy
Japanese television set.

19
00:01:10,987 --> 00:01:15,949
The other employment you found
was in a fast-food joint, which lasted...

20
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:17,493
28 minutes ?

21
00:01:17,994 --> 00:01:20,329
That's some kind of record.
Talk about fast.

22
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:25,084
Those people are crazy. They expect
you to learn that stuff in one day.

23
00:01:25,293 --> 00:01:29,254
"Hold the lettuce. Hold the ketchup.
Can I have some sauce, please ?"

24
00:01:29,464 --> 00:01:32,007
- Mr. Gorman...
- "Two buns. No buns. Some cheese".

25
00:01:32,342 --> 00:01:35,719
Mr. Gorman, the city of Metropolis
is generous to a fault, but...

26
00:01:36,012 --> 00:01:37,096
I'm not the fault !

27
00:01:37,263 --> 00:01:39,181
Thirty-six weeks
of chronic unemployment.

28
00:01:39,349 --> 00:01:42,518
Thirty-six weeks of living off the taxes
of hard-working citizens.

29
00:01:42,727 --> 00:01:45,979
- Do you know what you are ?
- Don't call me a bum, I'm not a bum !

30
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:51,819
You are, I was about to say,
no longer eligible.

31
00:01:52,445 --> 00:01:53,862
- Well, look...
- Next.

32
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:56,156
Wait. What about this week ?
I need this week !

33
00:01:56,533 --> 00:01:57,616
Next.

34
00:01:57,951 --> 00:01:59,535
You mean, that's it ?

35
00:01:59,869 --> 00:02:01,745
"Finished," like "over" ?

36
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:06,750
Next.

37
00:02:07,377 --> 00:02:09,253
"Next" as in "bye".

38
00:02:10,004 --> 00:02:11,255
Next !

39
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:15,342
Name.

40
00:02:17,053 --> 00:02:19,054
Excuse me, brother,
can I have a light ?

41
00:02:49,711 --> 00:02:51,920
- How you doing, Alex ?
- Hi, Jimmy.

42
00:03:51,105 --> 00:03:53,106
Huh ? Ah.

43
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:50,914
Excuse me.

44
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:07,616
Say thank you.

45
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:09,368
Wow !

46
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:28,970
Way to go, Superman !

47
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:46,882
Your drink is on its way.

48
00:07:48,384 --> 00:07:49,551
Sir.

49
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:51,303
Excuse me...

50
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:58,018
but what if you wanna program two
bilateral coordinates at the same time ?

51
00:07:58,227 --> 00:08:00,228
You can't do that. It's impossible.

52
00:08:00,396 --> 00:08:02,147
- But if you can't...
- Oh, no.

53
00:08:02,356 --> 00:08:06,401
Computer technology is very advanced,
young lady, but it can't do that.

54
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:09,571
But if you think we can't
do it that way, what happens ?

55
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:11,364
Sir.

56
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:17,913
Good Lord.

57
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:19,915
How did you do that ?

58
00:08:20,124 --> 00:08:23,710
I don't know. I just did it.

59
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:45,232
- Who's this ?
- That's him, Ross Webster.

60
00:08:45,441 --> 00:08:48,443
Just after he received the award for
Humanitarian of the Year.

61
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:50,362
He is good-looking.

62
00:08:50,571 --> 00:08:52,447
Because I gave him F2 at a 50th.

63
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:54,449
One thing I don't understand...

64
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:58,954
the point of the story Lois wrote
is how Ross got this great honor...

65
00:08:59,121 --> 00:09:02,791
and you bring me one picture of him
and 15 pictures of this other person.

66
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:05,627
- Who is she ?
- Lorelei Ambrosia. She's Webster's...

67
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:08,463
She's just Webster's.
Let's leave it at that.

68
00:09:08,673 --> 00:09:11,299
- Who's this other woman ?
- His sister, Vera Webster.

69
00:09:11,467 --> 00:09:12,801
- Picture looks fuzzy.
- What ?

70
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:16,763
The picture's fine, chief.
She looks like that in real life.

71
00:09:17,306 --> 00:09:21,184
- She's VP of Webscoe Industries.
- I really don't understand you.

72
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:24,688
A boring banquet and you bring me
3000 boring pictures.

73
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:27,649
Yet Superman saves a man
from drowning on Third Avenue...

74
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:31,236
while you just stand there and
you don't bring me one picture !

75
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:33,238
Chief, I didn't have
my camera with me.

76
00:09:33,447 --> 00:09:37,826
A photographer eats with his camera.
A photographer sleeps with his camera.

77
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:40,453
- I'm glad I'm a writer.
- Mr. White, please.

78
00:09:40,663 --> 00:09:43,832
It's time for you to draw this month's
winning JINGO number.

79
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,585
Prize is an all-expenses trip
to South America.

80
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:49,588
- I don't know why the idiot in Circulation...
- Good morning.

81
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:51,798
- Hi, Clark.
- Hi, Lois. Morning, Jimmy.

82
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:53,758
You've got mustard on your lapel.

83
00:09:53,968 --> 00:09:55,969
Excuse me, Mr. White,
I hate to interrupt...

84
00:09:56,178 --> 00:09:58,430
Sorry. I'm busy.
I got a paper to get out here.

85
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:00,682
It'll never replace the printing press.

86
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:03,852
- What's the number, Mr. White ?
- Fifty-three.

87
00:10:05,354 --> 00:10:08,023
- Mr. White...
- Fifty-three !

88
00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:11,693
- Mr. White...
- You've got to pull three more numbers.

89
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:14,654
I promised I'd call them back today.
What do you think ?

90
00:10:15,197 --> 00:10:18,867
- Well, I don't know, Kent...
- I think it'd make a terrific story.

91
00:10:20,036 --> 00:10:21,703
What's a terrific story ?

92
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:24,247
Kent's been invited
to his high-school reunion.

93
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:26,207
- Say.
- Yeah.

94
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:28,209
Could we have the next number ?

95
00:10:28,377 --> 00:10:30,879
It's practically an
American institution. Isn't it ?

96
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:35,008
I don't know, Mr. Kent. Most of
the people I know are still in high school.

97
00:10:38,554 --> 00:10:39,638
Thirty-three.

98
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:42,557
What I thought this story
would be about, Mr. White, is...

99
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:44,392
Thirty-three.

100
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:48,396
is how much the typical small town
has changed in the last 15 years.

101
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:49,773
Take me, for example:

102
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:53,652
Can I really go back to middle America
now as a Metropolis sophisticate ?

103
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:56,821
I'm really excited about this.
In fact, I was looking around...

104
00:10:57,031 --> 00:10:59,491
in my closet last night...

105
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:03,536
and I even found
my old high-school sweater.

106
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:07,916
- Smallville.
- Mr. White.

107
00:11:08,584 --> 00:11:10,585
Can I go ahead
and make my travel plan ?

108
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:12,295
Same question about mine.

109
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:16,925
Tell your people the prodigal son
and his photographer are coming home.

110
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:18,927
Oh, gee, thanks, Mr. White.

111
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:24,099
It isn't easy for me to lose
one of my best reporters.

112
00:11:24,308 --> 00:11:26,685
- That's okay.
- You deserve the vacation, Lois.

113
00:11:26,894 --> 00:11:28,103
Thank you.

114
00:11:30,773 --> 00:11:32,232
Lois, are you going someplace ?

115
00:11:33,442 --> 00:11:37,112
Clark, you know some people
get to go all the way to Smallville...

116
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:41,074
and then there are others of us
who have to go to Bermuda.

117
00:11:41,575 --> 00:11:42,909
Golly.

118
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:44,452
- Bye.
- Bye, Miss Lane.

119
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:49,958
- Have fun.
- Mr. White, the next number, please.

120
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:53,128
Well, I guess I better be going too.

121
00:11:55,089 --> 00:11:56,756
So I'll be going.

122
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:01,219
Bye.

123
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:05,807
Couldn't we get a computer to do this ?

124
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:31,875
- Hey, what is this ?
- First paycheck.

125
00:12:32,293 --> 00:12:36,504
This is the first rip-off, man ! We're
supposed to get 225 a week, right ?

126
00:12:36,672 --> 00:12:39,966
This says, "$143.80".
How am I supposed to live on that ?

127
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:43,470
State tax, federal tax,
social security tax...

128
00:12:43,637 --> 00:12:46,306
It's so you're still getting
some money when you hit 65.

129
00:12:46,474 --> 00:12:48,683
So I'm getting money when I ? 65 ?

130
00:12:48,934 --> 00:12:50,185
I want mine now !

131
00:12:50,394 --> 00:12:54,898
I want to enjoy it while I'm young.
I wanna get up and get down. Boogie.

132
00:12:56,400 --> 00:13:01,196
Actually, it's probably more like
$143.80 and one half cent.

133
00:13:01,405 --> 00:13:05,700
There are always fractions left over,
but big corporations round it down.

134
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:08,703
What do I do with half a cent ?
Buy a thoroughbred mouse ?

135
00:13:08,913 --> 00:13:10,705
Everybody loses those fractions ?

136
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:13,708
They don't lose them.
You can't lose what you never got.

137
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:16,127
Then what happens ?
The company gets them ?

138
00:13:16,337 --> 00:13:20,965
They can't be bothered collecting that
from your paycheck any more than you.

139
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:22,550
Then what happens to them ?

140
00:13:22,843 --> 00:13:27,305
Well, they're just floating around out there.
The computers know where.

141
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:29,015
How many sugars ?

142
00:13:29,725 --> 00:13:31,059
One and a half.

143
00:13:38,442 --> 00:13:40,193
It's quitting time, Gus. You coming ?

144
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:45,031
Yeah. No, actually, I got some
stuff to finish up, so...

145
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:50,078
Working overtime, huh ? What are you
doing, buddy ? Looking for a raise ?

146
00:13:50,871 --> 00:13:53,248
Yeah, looking for a raise.

147
00:14:30,744 --> 00:14:31,786
You bet.

148
00:14:37,918 --> 00:14:41,629
But my Uncle Al on my father's
side, he won't eat her stuffing.

149
00:14:41,797 --> 00:14:46,467
He says it should be cooked on the outside.
She cooks it on the inside.

150
00:14:46,635 --> 00:14:49,804
My mother told my Aunt Helen.
She's my father's half sister.

151
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:52,140
- I told you that, right ?
- Yeah.

152
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:54,017
- And anyway, the family...
- Hey, hey.

153
00:14:54,435 --> 00:14:56,311
- Look at that.
- Wow.

154
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:11,492
Okay, your choice.
You can turn back or pull over till it's over.

155
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:14,245
- How long will it take ?
- Can't tell with these fires.

156
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:17,498
I mean, that fire...
That's spreading like wildfire.

157
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:19,167
It's just a building burning.

158
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:21,669
It's not just a building.
That's a chemical plant.

159
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:25,465
You know what I mean.
It's like... It's like chemicals.

160
00:15:25,674 --> 00:15:30,303
If any of that stuff goes up in smoke,
we're in for a hairy time around here.

161
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:33,306
- Clark.
- Yeah ?

162
00:15:33,474 --> 00:15:35,683
I want you to keep
these people distracted.

163
00:15:35,851 --> 00:15:37,018
What are you doing ?

164
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:40,313
What am I doing ?
Remember what the chief said ?

165
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:42,690
A photographer always
goes after a story.

166
00:15:42,858 --> 00:15:44,442
That could be dangerous, Jimmy.

167
00:15:44,652 --> 00:15:48,696
Danger goes with the territory,
Mr. Kent.

168
00:16:25,234 --> 00:16:28,486
Help me !

169
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:34,742
- How can I help ?
- Get this man a helmet.

170
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:37,120
- It's you. Forget the helmet.
- How bad is it ?

171
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:41,708
My God, it's a nightmare. Everything's
either explosive or flammable or worse.

172
00:16:45,921 --> 00:16:47,338
Get the ladder truck in here.

173
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:50,383
- It won't reach.
- My God, they're trapped !

174
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:53,928
What's he gonna do ?
Fly them down one at a time ?

175
00:17:12,156 --> 00:17:14,282
Let's go ! Everybody,
down there ! Move it !

176
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:16,117
Come on ! Hurry up !

177
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:17,410
There you go.

178
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:23,166
Right down there. Take it easy.

179
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:27,253
All right. Everybody down there !

180
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:30,631
Keep moving !

181
00:18:03,832 --> 00:18:06,000
Sir, get out. I'll show you
the quickest way.

182
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:08,336
Go on. Look after the others.
I can't leave.

183
00:18:08,504 --> 00:18:10,755
- Why not ?
- I gotta stay and look after those.

184
00:18:10,964 --> 00:18:12,507
That's concentrated Beltric acid.

185
00:18:12,716 --> 00:18:15,802
If that stuff heats up over 180 degrees,
we've got a crisis...

186
00:18:16,011 --> 00:18:18,346
that'll make this fire
look like a picnic.

187
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:19,597
What does it do ?

188
00:18:19,848 --> 00:18:22,642
As long as it remains stable,
it's just ordinary acid.

189
00:18:23,018 --> 00:18:26,312
But if it begins to heat up,
it'll turn volatile.

190
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:29,732
You'll get a great cloud of smoke
that will eat through anything.

191
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:32,527
Steel, concrete, anything.

192
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:45,164
Who the hell is that ?

193
00:18:45,332 --> 00:18:50,169
- Hey, you ! Get off of there !
- I'm just gonna get a couple more shots.

194
00:18:57,678 --> 00:19:00,471
Ow ! Ah !

195
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:09,772
Tell them to bring their hoses
back here ! Quickly !

196
00:19:12,776 --> 00:19:13,860
Help !

197
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:17,196
Help ! Help me !

198
00:19:19,032 --> 00:19:22,535
Help ! Somebody help me !

199
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:25,079
- Help !
- It's all right.

200
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:27,915
- Superman ! My leg.
- I got you. Take it easy.

201
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:29,876
All right. We'll go nice and easy.

202
00:19:30,085 --> 00:19:33,880
Okay, I'm sorry.
All right ? Here we go.

203
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:39,927
Medics ! Over here, please.

204
00:19:40,554 --> 00:19:42,722
That's it. Here you go.

205
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:44,432
Go easy. It's the left leg.

206
00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:47,268
- My camera.
- Yeah.

207
00:19:48,729 --> 00:19:50,813
It's a clean break right across the fibula.

208
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:54,901
- My camera.
- Sorry, Jimmy. You'll be okay.

209
00:19:56,403 --> 00:20:00,823
Get that fire out, otherwise there'll be an
acid cloud all over the Eastern seaboard.

210
00:20:04,912 --> 00:20:07,455
- The pump house is gone !
- What ?

211
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:10,124
- The pump house !
- We've lost the water pressure !

212
00:20:11,835 --> 00:20:13,628
- We've got to have water !
- How ?

213
00:20:13,795 --> 00:20:16,797
Lake Comooga's five miles from here.
We'd need a five-mile hose !

214
00:20:16,965 --> 00:20:18,966
- Where's this lake ?
- That way.

215
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:28,768
Tell them it's hopeless.

216
00:20:28,936 --> 00:20:31,354
You told me we had
an adequate water supply.

217
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:33,541
Water !

218
00:21:48,724 --> 00:21:50,725
I tell you, that man's a miracle !

219
00:22:16,585 --> 00:22:19,086
Carol, you got gorgeous !

220
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:32,224
Look at you.

221
00:22:40,525 --> 00:22:43,736
That was against Mid-City.
I'll never forget it.

222
00:22:45,113 --> 00:22:46,906
Fourth quarter, score was tied...

223
00:22:47,574 --> 00:22:49,784
we're back at the 25-yard line.

224
00:22:50,077 --> 00:22:53,287
Coach sends in a play,
Right Flanker Option.

225
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:05,424
You really have grown, Clark.

226
00:23:05,592 --> 00:23:07,468
You look very well, Miss Bannister.

227
00:23:07,636 --> 00:23:12,431
I can't complain. I take the stairs
a little slow and I have these spells.

228
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:15,142
But really, I can't complain.

229
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:17,103
Lana ?

230
00:23:18,271 --> 00:23:19,313
Clark ?

231
00:23:24,903 --> 00:23:28,489
Would you excuse me ? There's someone
I'd really like to say hello to.

232
00:23:31,827 --> 00:23:33,077
Lana ?

233
00:23:34,454 --> 00:23:37,623
- Lana Lang ? It's great to see you.
- Clark.

234
00:23:38,959 --> 00:23:42,336
- You look wonderful.
- Me ? No, you look...

235
00:23:42,546 --> 00:23:45,548
- Let me give you a hand with that.
- No, no. I can manage.

236
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:47,675
Uh...

237
00:23:49,052 --> 00:23:52,304
This is the first time you've come back
since your mom passed away.

238
00:23:52,514 --> 00:23:54,348
Yeah. I'm sorry.

239
00:23:57,352 --> 00:23:58,519
I heard that you and...

240
00:23:59,479 --> 00:24:01,814
- Donald split up.
- Did you eat yet ?

241
00:24:02,023 --> 00:24:03,065
No.

242
00:24:03,358 --> 00:24:06,068
Beg your pardon. Excuse me. Sorry.

243
00:24:09,865 --> 00:24:11,699
- That's not right.
- No ?

244
00:24:11,867 --> 00:24:14,368
You're right about Donald and me,
but... Hold this, okay ?

245
00:24:14,578 --> 00:24:15,953
Oh, sure.

246
00:24:18,373 --> 00:24:19,874
Hi, Kent.

247
00:24:20,208 --> 00:24:22,501
Hi. How you doing ?

248
00:24:23,712 --> 00:24:26,005
I'm sorry. I'm going nuts. Thanks.

249
00:24:29,885 --> 00:24:31,844
- Clark.
- Yeah.

250
00:24:32,721 --> 00:24:34,221
Lana.

251
00:24:34,723 --> 00:24:36,891
Uh-oh. Um...

252
00:24:37,225 --> 00:24:38,392
Hey, sweet.

253
00:24:38,727 --> 00:24:39,894
Here I am.

254
00:24:41,104 --> 00:24:45,232
Remember when you were prom queen ?
All these guys were waiting for a dance ?

255
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:48,068
There's only one guy on your
dance card now. Huh, honey ?

256
00:24:48,236 --> 00:24:50,112
- That's good old...
- Brad Wilson.

257
00:24:50,697 --> 00:24:53,157
- Hi, Brad.
- Hi, Kent.

258
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:55,242
Long time no see.

259
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:57,328
You know, see, see, see ?

260
00:24:57,996 --> 00:25:00,539
- Come on, Lana.
- No, I can't.

261
00:25:00,916 --> 00:25:02,875
- Clark already asked me.
- I did ?

262
00:25:03,043 --> 00:25:04,877
- Yeah.
- Oh, excuse me.

263
00:25:06,004 --> 00:25:07,880
Lana, I haven't danced...

264
00:25:52,676 --> 00:25:55,469
Ah, Gorman.
Another week, another check.

265
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:02,309
Don't you have another one for me ?
I put in a voucher for expenses.

266
00:26:02,477 --> 00:26:03,811
What ?

267
00:26:07,148 --> 00:26:08,190
Yeah, yeah.

268
00:26:08,483 --> 00:26:09,692
Here you go.

269
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:22,663
Ooo...

270
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:34,091
Thanks for helping me out.

271
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:37,011
You kidding ? A lot of guys
would like to be where I am.

272
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:39,638
You'd be surprised at how many
offers I didn't get.

273
00:26:39,806 --> 00:26:41,515
Even Brad wouldn't stick around.

274
00:26:41,725 --> 00:26:43,183
It really isn't easy.

275
00:26:43,351 --> 00:26:45,352
The streamers ?
Yeah, you just pull, and...

276
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:48,022
No, not the streamers. Everything.

277
00:26:48,231 --> 00:26:50,524
Not that I'm complaining.
It's just that...

278
00:26:50,775 --> 00:26:53,694
I don't know why,
I just feel like I can talk to you.

279
00:26:53,862 --> 00:26:54,987
What ?

280
00:26:55,155 --> 00:26:57,489
I feel like I can talk to you !

281
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:00,034
- You can ?
- Yes.

282
00:27:00,243 --> 00:27:02,202
- You know something, Lana ?
- What ?

283
00:27:04,247 --> 00:27:05,539
I always...

284
00:27:06,333 --> 00:27:08,042
I always wished that you would.

285
00:27:08,251 --> 00:27:10,210
I mean, even back in high school.

286
00:27:10,378 --> 00:27:13,047
- Remember when you were ?
- Queen of the prom.

287
00:27:13,632 --> 00:27:16,675
Then three years after the royal wedding,
the king abdicated.

288
00:27:16,885 --> 00:27:19,053
- Isn't that terrible ?
- Yeah, sure is.

289
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:23,057
There must be a gallon
of potato salad left over.

290
00:27:23,683 --> 00:27:25,559
You know what the problem is ?

291
00:27:26,686 --> 00:27:28,562
I don't know, too much mayonnaise ?

292
00:27:28,772 --> 00:27:31,523
Donald loved mayonnaise.
Why would that be the problem ?

293
00:27:31,733 --> 00:27:34,568
No, the problem is,
why do I stay in Smallville ?

294
00:27:34,778 --> 00:27:36,528
Believe me, I've asked myself that.

295
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:41,241
Do you know how lucky you are
to live in Metropolis ? The Big Apricot.

296
00:27:41,409 --> 00:27:42,660
Well, Lana, you could...

297
00:27:42,827 --> 00:27:45,579
Easy to say. But how ?
What about Ricky ?

298
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:48,165
- Ricky ?
- My little boy.

299
00:27:48,583 --> 00:27:50,709
- You ? Oh, that's great.
- Yeah.

300
00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:55,422
I mean, at least here we have a house
and I've got a job that pays the bills.

301
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:59,093
Except for last winter when
the fuel bills kept going up and up.

302
00:27:59,803 --> 00:28:02,596
Yeah. Even had to pawn
my diamond ring then.

303
00:28:02,931 --> 00:28:04,223
That's a shame.

304
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:13,607
You never got married ?

305
00:28:15,694 --> 00:28:17,319
- Me ?
- Yeah.

306
00:28:17,821 --> 00:28:19,279
Well, I was...

307
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:22,282
No. Not...

308
00:28:31,459 --> 00:28:34,336
You know, years later you can
look at someone and think...

309
00:28:34,587 --> 00:28:37,339
"Well, I guess that's
the one that got away".

310
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:45,806
Give me that again, old buddy.
Run it by me just one more time.

311
00:28:45,974 --> 00:28:48,475
- Eighty-five thousand dollars.
- Missing ?

312
00:28:48,643 --> 00:28:52,229
Embezzled, Mr. Webster.
Stolen from the firm.

313
00:28:52,439 --> 00:28:53,647
By whom ?

314
00:28:53,857 --> 00:28:56,358
That's what I want to know.
By whom ? Whom ?

315
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:58,152
Vera, get ahold of yourself.

316
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:00,446
Nobody else ever will.

317
00:29:01,156 --> 00:29:02,322
I don't know.

318
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:03,490
Whom ?

319
00:29:03,658 --> 00:29:05,826
In the old days it was simple.

320
00:29:05,994 --> 00:29:10,372
We kept books, we knew what was
going in and what was paid out.

321
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:12,249
If somebody wanted to rob you...

322
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:14,960
they'd come in with a gun and say,
"Stick them up".

323
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:18,297
Now they get blasted computers
to do their dirty work.

324
00:29:18,882 --> 00:29:21,759
My old friend, you are yesterday.

325
00:29:21,968 --> 00:29:24,845
Whoever pulled this caper is tomorrow.

326
00:29:26,973 --> 00:29:29,141
Mr. Webster,
it's time for your massage.

327
00:29:29,309 --> 00:29:31,185
Does this woman
have the right to burst in ?

328
00:29:31,394 --> 00:29:34,980
Now, now, Vera. Simpson,
you know my psychic nutritionist ?

329
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:39,318
- Hello.
- We are trying to hold a meeting here.

330
00:29:39,486 --> 00:29:43,530
Why don't you hold your breath instead.
Maybe you'll turn blue.

331
00:29:43,698 --> 00:29:47,034
- Improvement.
- I'm about to take a human life.

332
00:29:47,202 --> 00:29:50,412
Simpson, would you excuse us
for a second, please ?

333
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,044
- Mouths closed. Ears open.
- She's a big pig.

334
00:29:57,212 --> 00:30:00,339
I can't have anyone with me
who isn't with me.

335
00:30:00,673 --> 00:30:02,049
Now, girls.

336
00:30:02,509 --> 00:30:04,009
Simpson.

337
00:30:04,344 --> 00:30:05,719
Well, old chum. What now ?

338
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:08,680
Kiss the 85 thou goodbye ?

339
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:12,684
Keep on paying the thief his salary
until he shakes the money tree again ?

340
00:30:12,894 --> 00:30:15,979
- He's bound to slip up sooner or later.
- Why ?

341
00:30:16,189 --> 00:30:18,524
That's what they always say
in the movies.

342
00:30:18,733 --> 00:30:21,235
He won't slip up at all. No, not at all.

343
00:30:21,444 --> 00:30:24,071
He'll keep quietly taking
the bread from our mouths.

344
00:30:24,239 --> 00:30:28,492
He'll keep a low profile and won't
do a thing to call attention to himself.

345
00:30:28,701 --> 00:30:33,080
Unless, of course, he is
a complete and utter moron.

346
00:30:50,723 --> 00:30:52,474
I'll go first. Andrew.

347
00:30:52,684 --> 00:30:56,103
- I'll pick Chris.
- You feel good ? You feel ready ?

348
00:30:56,354 --> 00:30:57,604
LANA
Ricky, your shoe.

349
00:30:57,772 --> 00:31:01,108
- You mean, we've gotta take Ricky ?
- You guys lost the toss.

350
00:31:01,276 --> 00:31:03,443
All right, come on, Ricky.

351
00:31:03,611 --> 00:31:05,612
- Wait, wait...
- Come on, good luck.

352
00:31:06,739 --> 00:31:09,575
- I just can't stand this.
- Oh, Lana. It'll be okay.

353
00:31:09,784 --> 00:31:12,077
I know, I was a late bloomer myself.

354
00:31:12,287 --> 00:31:16,957
It's not just that he's small, he's
the only kid in town without a father.

355
00:31:17,375 --> 00:31:21,712
Oh, look. He's stewed to the gills
in the middle of the afternoon.

356
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:24,089
- Gee, all he had was chocolate milk.
- No, him.

357
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:25,757
Hey, sweet thing.

358
00:31:26,217 --> 00:31:28,135
Little kid getting hassled, huh ?

359
00:31:28,803 --> 00:31:31,305
- Kent, you still here ?
- I seem to be, Brad.

360
00:31:31,514 --> 00:31:34,224
All he needs is a few pointers
from the old champ here.

361
00:31:34,601 --> 00:31:37,269
I won the all-country bowling
trophy two years in a row.

362
00:31:37,437 --> 00:31:38,478
I didn't know that.

363
00:31:38,646 --> 00:31:40,606
Yeah. Natural athlete
can play any sport.

364
00:31:40,773 --> 00:31:42,566
Brad, you're just gonna
make it worse.

365
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:45,235
- It's all right. It'll be okay.
- He'll make it worse.

366
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:53,577
You watch, he'll get a spare.

367
00:31:53,828 --> 00:31:55,287
Come on, Ricky.

368
00:31:56,664 --> 00:31:58,540
Hey, kid, you're holding it all wrong.

369
00:31:59,125 --> 00:32:02,419
- Let old Brad show you how it's done.
- Brad.

370
00:32:03,338 --> 00:32:07,341
Excuse me. Say, Brad, I think maybe
he'll be better off doing it his way.

371
00:32:07,592 --> 00:32:11,136
For a guy lucky to be waterboy,
you've got a big mouth.

372
00:32:11,554 --> 00:32:14,598
I don't think he needs a lesson
in front of the other kids.

373
00:32:14,807 --> 00:32:18,685
- He needs a man to show him.
- He's doing just fine. Excuse me.

374
00:32:20,563 --> 00:32:21,855
Here you go, Ricky.

375
00:32:22,065 --> 00:32:25,067
And give it your best shot.
Okay ? There you go.

376
00:32:27,487 --> 00:32:28,695
Sorry.

377
00:32:35,203 --> 00:32:36,370
Ah-choo !

378
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:46,213
Gesundheit.

379
00:32:46,381 --> 00:32:47,547
Thank you.

380
00:32:50,593 --> 00:32:52,844
Hey, Gus, the boss wants to see you.

381
00:32:53,054 --> 00:32:55,597
He can see me all right.
Hello, Mr. Lewis.

382
00:32:55,807 --> 00:32:59,226
No, not that boss. The boss.

383
00:33:00,395 --> 00:33:01,895
- You mean, the boss...
- Yup.

384
00:33:02,105 --> 00:33:03,563
- Wants to see me ?
- Yup.

385
00:33:03,731 --> 00:33:06,900
Oh, my God,
why would he wanna see me ?

386
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:08,235
I mean...

387
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:11,905
Why would the boss wanna see me ?

388
00:33:13,157 --> 00:33:14,825
There's no reason.

389
00:33:16,119 --> 00:33:17,619
Then why'd he ? Oh, I know !

390
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:20,914
It's my suggestion
for the volleyball uniforms.

391
00:33:21,124 --> 00:33:22,332
That's it.

392
00:33:34,929 --> 00:33:38,140
Ross the boss.
Ross the boss. The boss !

393
00:33:39,058 --> 00:33:41,143
Be calm. Be cool. Be collected.

394
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:48,859
Mr. Webster ? Mr. Webster ?

395
00:33:49,402 --> 00:33:52,696
Mr. Webster, I did not... Mr. Webster.

396
00:33:53,114 --> 00:33:55,115
Mr. August Gorman ?

397
00:33:55,283 --> 00:33:56,533
August Gorman here.

398
00:33:56,743 --> 00:34:01,288
I know you're a man of compassion,
and I don't wanna go to jail...

399
00:34:01,456 --> 00:34:03,457
because they have robbers
and rapists...

400
00:34:03,666 --> 00:34:06,043
I just wanna ask you one question.

401
00:34:06,252 --> 00:34:08,962
You've been a naughty guy,
haven't you ?

402
00:34:09,213 --> 00:34:10,630
Come on, admit it now.

403
00:34:10,798 --> 00:34:13,300
You've been just a little bit naughty,
haven't you ?

404
00:34:13,551 --> 00:34:16,303
- I was kind of...
- That's all right. I understand.

405
00:34:16,471 --> 00:34:19,681
I can... What do
the young folks say today ?

406
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:22,559
"Dig where you're
coming from, brother".

407
00:34:22,769 --> 00:34:25,604
- You wanna be rich, right ?
- How, wha...

408
00:34:25,813 --> 00:34:29,316
I was born rich. Never worn
the same pair of socks twice.

409
00:34:29,484 --> 00:34:30,984
What do you do with your socks ?

410
00:34:31,235 --> 00:34:35,113
I don't know. They're laundered and sent
to some charitable institution, I think.

411
00:34:35,323 --> 00:34:38,492
Actually, I don't know.
Maybe they turn them into dust rags...

412
00:34:38,701 --> 00:34:40,160
or pen-wipers or something.

413
00:34:40,328 --> 00:34:41,995
Or maybe socks.

414
00:34:42,205 --> 00:34:44,956
Yes ! That never occurred to me.

415
00:34:45,166 --> 00:34:48,960
Gus, you know something ?
You're a genius.

416
00:34:49,212 --> 00:34:52,839
A naughty genius, but what the hell ?
Nobody's perfect, right ? Cheers.

417
00:34:53,007 --> 00:34:56,009
Because of the half-cent thing
with the computers.

418
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:59,179
No, no, because computers
rule the world today.

419
00:34:59,347 --> 00:35:03,016
The fellow that can fool the computers
can rule the world himself.

420
00:35:04,018 --> 00:35:07,521
I've been searching for somebody
who can make these machines...

421
00:35:07,688 --> 00:35:10,023
do what they're not supposed to.
Get my drift ?

422
00:35:10,441 --> 00:35:12,150
- Yes !
- Gus...

423
00:35:12,318 --> 00:35:17,114
Webscoe, the Webscoe industrial
complex, is a family-owned cartel.

424
00:35:17,323 --> 00:35:19,199
Some magnesium here,
some zinc there.

425
00:35:19,367 --> 00:35:21,368
Railroads, farm machinery.
You follow me ?

426
00:35:21,536 --> 00:35:23,036
I follow you, sir.

427
00:35:23,246 --> 00:35:25,372
- Gus, do you know what I want now ?
- No.

428
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:26,623
I want coffee.

429
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:28,542
All right. Black, cream, sugar, or ?

430
00:35:28,751 --> 00:35:30,794
No, you don't seem to understand.

431
00:35:31,003 --> 00:35:34,381
Under different company names,
I control the price of coffee beans...

432
00:35:34,632 --> 00:35:38,760
in Venezuela, Brazil, Bolivia,
Jamaica and the Republic of Gabon.

433
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:42,722
But I've got a problem and I think
maybe you can help me.

434
00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:46,893
One country won't play ball with me.
You know how that can bug a guy, right ?

435
00:35:47,061 --> 00:35:49,396
That could bug... What country ?

436
00:35:50,773 --> 00:35:53,024
- Colombia.
- Colombia ?

437
00:35:53,192 --> 00:35:56,194
Colombia has two important exports,
and one of them's coffee.

438
00:35:56,404 --> 00:36:00,031
And I've tried to reason with them.
Believe me, I've tried.

439
00:36:00,241 --> 00:36:03,368
But this one miserable,
pissant little country...

440
00:36:03,578 --> 00:36:08,915
has the gall to think it can dictate
the economy of an open market. Gus.

441
00:36:09,417 --> 00:36:11,751
Gus, my friend...

442
00:36:12,587 --> 00:36:15,380
we're going to teach them
a lesson, aren't we ?

443
00:36:16,424 --> 00:36:19,259
Destroy the entire
Colombian coffee crop...

444
00:36:19,427 --> 00:36:21,928
right down to the last bean.

445
00:36:22,096 --> 00:36:24,389
- The last bean, we are.
- Right.

446
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:27,934
But you got so much. You know, like...

447
00:36:28,102 --> 00:36:30,812
A wise man once said,
I think it was Attila the Hun...

448
00:36:31,022 --> 00:36:33,607
"It is not enough that I succeed.

449
00:36:33,816 --> 00:36:36,776
Everyone else must fail".

450
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:38,528
Seems fair.

451
00:36:38,821 --> 00:36:40,280
- Gus.
- What ?

452
00:36:40,448 --> 00:36:44,117
You are going to do this for me.

453
00:36:46,746 --> 00:36:48,914
- How ?
- The weather.

454
00:36:49,624 --> 00:36:51,291
You didn't say your mother was here.

455
00:36:51,459 --> 00:36:54,461
I'm his sister. His baby sister.

456
00:36:54,629 --> 00:36:57,631
Gus, tell me, have you ever
heard of Vulcan ?

457
00:36:57,965 --> 00:36:59,299
Hi, Ms. Vulcan.

458
00:36:59,467 --> 00:37:02,260
Vulcan is the weather satellite
our government put up...

459
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:03,803
to monitor the weather.

460
00:37:03,971 --> 00:37:08,266
But if somebody were to reprogram it,
it could do much more.

461
00:37:08,476 --> 00:37:10,101
It could make weather.

462
00:37:10,269 --> 00:37:11,811
Storms and floods.

463
00:37:11,979 --> 00:37:13,772
Blizzards, heat waves.

464
00:37:13,981 --> 00:37:15,148
How do you do that ?

465
00:37:15,566 --> 00:37:18,818
Like everything else
in the 20th century, Gus.

466
00:37:18,986 --> 00:37:20,487
You push buttons.

467
00:37:22,156 --> 00:37:25,367
- There you go.
- It's the first time I won anything.

468
00:37:25,576 --> 00:37:26,826
You won my hand, Maury.

469
00:37:26,994 --> 00:37:29,829
But this is the first time
I won anything valuable.

470
00:37:29,997 --> 00:37:31,665
Let's get one with the sombreros.

471
00:37:31,874 --> 00:37:35,168
Mr. White, you'll be in this,
handing them their plane tickets.

472
00:37:35,378 --> 00:37:37,837
- Why do I have to do this ?
- Why do I have to do this ?

473
00:37:38,005 --> 00:37:41,341
You're lucky I didn't fire you.
I get a chance at exclusive photos...

474
00:37:41,509 --> 00:37:43,343
of history's biggest factory fire.

475
00:37:43,511 --> 00:37:46,346
He comes home with a broken leg
and 12 melted rolls of film.

476
00:37:46,514 --> 00:37:47,847
It was hot.

477
00:37:48,015 --> 00:37:50,183
Smile, Mr. White.

478
00:37:51,185 --> 00:37:53,770
South America !
I can't believe my luck !

479
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:57,190
See, if you don't want them
to trace it back...

480
00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:00,527
you've gotta punch in
to some little rinky-dink outfit...

481
00:38:00,695 --> 00:38:03,154
that has a little
Mickey Mouse computer...

482
00:38:03,364 --> 00:38:06,324
Someplace you can sneak into, right ?

483
00:38:06,534 --> 00:38:07,701
Somebody could...

484
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:11,913
Someplace where nobody knows him
so they can't connect him with us.

485
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:14,040
Webscoe has 112 subsidiaries.

486
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:17,210
They're all linked into
the central computer system.

487
00:38:17,461 --> 00:38:19,045
How about someplace...

488
00:38:20,006 --> 00:38:21,047
small ?

489
00:38:23,718 --> 00:38:27,721
Smallville. This is Smallville.
We'll have a five-minute stop here.

490
00:38:28,681 --> 00:38:29,723
Mind your step.

491
00:38:29,974 --> 00:38:31,725
Watch your step, please.

492
00:38:32,476 --> 00:38:33,518
Thanks, Selma.

493
00:38:33,686 --> 00:38:36,062
Thanks a lot, Lana.
Have a good day, now.

494
00:38:40,359 --> 00:38:41,901
Let me help you, Lana.

495
00:38:43,738 --> 00:38:45,447
I'm sorry.

496
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:50,535
- Thanks, Clark.
- Sit down, Buster. Good boy.

497
00:38:50,745 --> 00:38:53,246
Come on, Buster, sit down.
That's a good boy.

498
00:38:53,456 --> 00:38:55,332
Okay. You all set ? Great.

499
00:38:59,086 --> 00:39:00,837
Wow.

500
00:39:08,429 --> 00:39:10,096
I'm not saying another word.

501
00:39:10,598 --> 00:39:13,600
That's it. Okay ?

502
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:17,437
Jesus Christ !

503
00:39:22,109 --> 00:39:25,111
Don't they have picnics in Metropolis,
Mr. Kent ?

504
00:39:25,363 --> 00:39:27,280
Well, not quite like this, Ricky.

505
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:29,449
- Mom and I do this all the time.
- You do ?

506
00:39:29,617 --> 00:39:32,619
- I'll help you.
- Stay close by and be careful, okay ?

507
00:39:32,787 --> 00:39:34,120
Okay, Mom.

508
00:39:34,288 --> 00:39:37,707
Come on, Buster. Let's find you
a rabbit. Come on. Rabbit.

509
00:39:37,917 --> 00:39:39,793
- This is so nice for him.
- Here you go.

510
00:39:40,044 --> 00:39:43,421
It's even nicer when there's a man around,
which isn't that often.

511
00:39:43,589 --> 00:39:46,132
- There's a lot of choices.
- The good ones are married.

512
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:48,635
That's why Brad thinks
he's God's gift to women.

513
00:39:49,303 --> 00:39:52,305
He won't take no for an answer,
but he's the only one asking.

514
00:39:52,515 --> 00:39:55,141
No, Lana, I meant
there's a lot of choices here.

515
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:57,936
This is really quite some picnic.
There's...

516
00:39:58,729 --> 00:40:00,021
some of that.

517
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:02,732
Green stuff.

518
00:40:04,235 --> 00:40:05,819
Hey, pâté.

519
00:40:08,155 --> 00:40:10,615
Boy, this pâté is really unusual.

520
00:40:11,158 --> 00:40:13,451
I didn't make any... Oh, Clark.

521
00:40:13,661 --> 00:40:15,912
That's Buster's dog food.

522
00:40:16,831 --> 00:40:18,331
- It's good.
- Don't eat it !

523
00:40:18,541 --> 00:40:19,833
What time's the dog eat ?

524
00:40:20,042 --> 00:40:21,960
- This is nice.
- Here.

525
00:40:22,169 --> 00:40:23,670
It's all right, Lana.

526
00:40:25,297 --> 00:40:26,506
Thanks.

527
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:30,176
Hey, where you going ? Come on !

528
00:40:30,344 --> 00:40:32,303
Buster, stop messing about !

529
00:40:35,558 --> 00:40:37,517
- How much longer ?
- I was just thinking...

530
00:40:37,685 --> 00:40:40,186
- I'm sorry. No, go ahead.
- No. You.

531
00:40:43,357 --> 00:40:45,024
Well...

532
00:40:46,694 --> 00:40:48,528
I was just thinking that...

533
00:40:48,696 --> 00:40:51,698
somebody like you
could do really well in Metropolis.

534
00:40:52,199 --> 00:40:56,578
I suppose I have to face it. I'm not gonna
find what I want in Smallville anymore.

535
00:40:59,165 --> 00:41:02,876
Could I make it in Metropolis ?
What would I do when I got there ?

536
00:41:05,337 --> 00:41:06,379
Call me.

537
00:41:06,547 --> 00:41:09,549
- No, I wouldn't wanna call you.
- You don't wanna call me ?

538
00:41:09,717 --> 00:41:14,095
Yes, I wanna call you, but I wouldn't
wanna be a nuisance to you.

539
00:41:14,597 --> 00:41:17,223
I don't think you could ever
be a nuisance to me, Lana.

540
00:41:19,602 --> 00:41:21,227
Clark, may I tell you something ?

541
00:41:25,232 --> 00:41:26,733
My oil pan is leaking.

542
00:41:32,656 --> 00:41:34,407
See ? There's something dripping.

543
00:41:34,575 --> 00:41:36,242
- Can I give you a hand ?
- No, thanks.

544
00:41:36,827 --> 00:41:40,246
With all the car trouble I have,
I studied up on auto repair.

545
00:41:40,748 --> 00:41:42,332
Look at this.

546
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:44,834
Oh, boy.

547
00:42:11,278 --> 00:42:14,697
Lana, I think I'll just go see
if Ricky's all right. You okay ?

548
00:42:14,865 --> 00:42:16,157
Yeah.

549
00:43:03,289 --> 00:43:05,331
Gosh, is he all right ?

550
00:43:13,424 --> 00:43:15,008
Hi.

551
00:43:17,636 --> 00:43:19,178
Superman ?

552
00:43:19,346 --> 00:43:20,722
That's me.

553
00:43:23,642 --> 00:43:25,476
Mom ! Mom !

554
00:43:27,855 --> 00:43:31,316
There you go. He's all right,
but have a doctor check him.

555
00:43:31,525 --> 00:43:33,192
Thank you.

556
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:35,862
- I'm Lana Lang. This is Ricky.
- Nice to meet you.

557
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:37,196
And this is Clark.

558
00:43:37,364 --> 00:43:40,325
I really have to be going.
So long, Ricky. Bye.

559
00:43:42,745 --> 00:43:44,162
We were flying, Mom !

560
00:43:44,371 --> 00:43:45,788
What were you doing, anyway ?

561
00:43:45,998 --> 00:43:47,373
I was looking for Buster.

562
00:43:47,541 --> 00:43:50,376
- Buster ! Buster !
- I found him !

563
00:43:51,629 --> 00:43:53,046
Come on, boy. That's it.

564
00:43:53,297 --> 00:43:55,882
Mr. Kent, Superman was here !

565
00:43:56,133 --> 00:43:58,259
- What ?
- Yes, he really was.

566
00:43:59,178 --> 00:44:00,720
Aren't you excited ?

567
00:44:00,888 --> 00:44:03,973
I'm from Metropolis.
I see Superman every day.

568
00:44:04,183 --> 00:44:07,185
You do ? Could you get me
his autograph ?

569
00:44:09,772 --> 00:44:13,650
I don't know. If I had a nickel
for every time some little kid...

570
00:44:36,674 --> 00:44:38,007
Yeah ? What do you want ?

571
00:44:38,217 --> 00:44:39,926
We're in big trouble, aren't we ?

572
00:44:40,094 --> 00:44:41,928
- What ?
- We're in big trouble.

573
00:44:42,096 --> 00:44:43,680
First, they lost the invoice.

574
00:44:43,889 --> 00:44:47,517
When they found it, they realized
they came up short on a few items.

575
00:44:47,726 --> 00:44:51,938
So I rented a car because I missed the
plane from Cleveland. 4:00, you know.

576
00:44:52,356 --> 00:44:55,608
And a flat tire on the highway.
What a kicker.

577
00:44:55,818 --> 00:44:58,945
Had to fix it myself
with these little pinkies.

578
00:44:59,446 --> 00:45:03,741
And I figured your boss was gonna be
real peeved, you know what I mean ?

579
00:45:04,118 --> 00:45:05,118
What do you mean ?

580
00:45:05,327 --> 00:45:07,954
He is going to hang our butts
against the wall.

581
00:45:08,455 --> 00:45:11,082
He wanted this special order installed...

582
00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:13,876
in his office no later
than tomorrow morning.

583
00:45:14,086 --> 00:45:16,295
Let me in because
I gotta set it up tonight.

584
00:45:16,463 --> 00:45:17,797
Get all what set up ?

585
00:45:27,933 --> 00:45:31,644
Pal, you are a real lifesaver.
I mean, a real lifesaver.

586
00:45:31,854 --> 00:45:33,980
- Which way's the office ?
- Straight on ahead.

587
00:45:34,231 --> 00:45:36,899
- Follow me.
- I'm right behind you.

588
00:45:37,067 --> 00:45:38,443
Oh, yeah.

589
00:45:38,610 --> 00:45:41,112
Not bad. It's pretty good.

590
00:45:42,114 --> 00:45:44,407
You know what's wrong with
this Singapore wing ?

591
00:45:44,616 --> 00:45:48,327
Sling ! Singapore Sling.

592
00:45:48,495 --> 00:45:50,830
What's wrong with it ?

593
00:45:50,998 --> 00:45:52,874
There's not enough vodka in it.

594
00:45:53,083 --> 00:45:55,668
There's no vodka in it !

595
00:45:55,919 --> 00:45:58,463
What did I tell you ?
Put some vodka in it.

596
00:45:58,672 --> 00:46:01,466
What did you ? You know.

597
00:46:07,681 --> 00:46:10,433
- Yeah.
- There's vodka in it now, buddy.

598
00:46:14,646 --> 00:46:15,688
Yeah, perfect.

599
00:46:16,023 --> 00:46:19,025
- You never do pass out, do you ?
- Nope.

600
00:46:23,405 --> 00:46:24,614
Never.

601
00:46:25,532 --> 00:46:27,658
Job well done, buddy.

602
00:46:28,035 --> 00:46:30,411
You thought I was drunk too,
didn't you ? Ha, ha.

603
00:46:30,954 --> 00:46:32,038
Fooled you.

604
00:46:32,206 --> 00:46:34,791
Get the keys, get the keys.

605
00:46:53,852 --> 00:46:55,812
Somebody's drunk.

606
00:46:59,483 --> 00:47:01,234
Hello, baby !

607
00:47:02,069 --> 00:47:03,569
How's the little baby ?

608
00:47:03,737 --> 00:47:05,154
Okay.

609
00:47:05,572 --> 00:47:09,450
All right, let's get down to it.
Let's do it.

610
00:47:11,078 --> 00:47:14,247
One, two, button your shoe.

611
00:47:30,389 --> 00:47:34,684
"Both keys at the same time" ?

612
00:47:34,893 --> 00:47:36,561
Whoa.

613
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:50,700
Wait. Wait a minute.

614
00:47:50,951 --> 00:47:52,702
Think you've won, don't you ?

615
00:47:54,204 --> 00:47:56,289
The Philly Flash !

616
00:48:47,132 --> 00:48:49,175
Okay, ready ?

617
00:48:50,302 --> 00:48:52,970
One, two, three !

618
00:49:02,856 --> 00:49:07,652
Yeah. Now we'll see what we'll see.

619
00:50:27,941 --> 00:50:29,275
Oh.

620
00:50:33,196 --> 00:50:34,613
Oh...

621
00:50:44,666 --> 00:50:46,208
Oh.

622
00:51:27,459 --> 00:51:28,667
Come on, please.

623
00:51:31,505 --> 00:51:32,797
There it is !

624
00:51:32,964 --> 00:51:34,507
Hello ! Now...

625
00:51:34,716 --> 00:51:36,342
getting down to business.

626
00:51:39,471 --> 00:51:41,347
I am a genius.

627
00:51:42,849 --> 00:51:44,517
I am a...

628
00:51:53,777 --> 00:51:55,152
Longitude...

629
00:51:55,362 --> 00:51:58,155
and the other thing. Latitude, right ?

630
00:52:15,048 --> 00:52:17,883
Oh, look, Maury. A native wedding.

631
00:52:42,909 --> 00:52:46,078
No one said at the Daily Planet
that this was the rainy season !

632
00:53:23,950 --> 00:53:27,119
Meteorologists are baffled
by the tornado and rainstorms...

633
00:53:27,329 --> 00:53:30,122
that struck the country
of Colombia this afternoon...

634
00:53:30,290 --> 00:53:34,793
threatening to destroy the nation's
entire coffee crop for the next five years.

635
00:53:34,961 --> 00:53:36,629
Gale-force winds up to...

636
00:53:36,838 --> 00:53:39,965
an incredible 250 miles an hour
lashed the countryside...

637
00:53:40,467 --> 00:53:44,887
while 12 inches of rainfall have
already been recorded in just one day.

638
00:53:45,555 --> 00:53:49,808
A spokesman for the Department of
Meteorology said this was, I quote...

639
00:53:49,976 --> 00:53:53,729
"The most awesome display of
natural forces since Noah's ark".

640
00:53:53,939 --> 00:53:56,774
If I laugh any harder, I'll split my sides !

641
00:53:56,942 --> 00:54:00,069
to defy all laws of
weather systems known to science.

642
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:04,323
What a shame.

643
00:54:06,243 --> 00:54:08,827
Poor little Colombia. Well...

644
00:54:20,006 --> 00:54:22,508
I'm gonna get you for that,
you big silly !

645
00:54:22,676 --> 00:54:25,636
Bubba, do you realize what we're on to ?

646
00:54:25,845 --> 00:54:27,388
Do I ?

647
00:54:27,597 --> 00:54:30,683
Every time a drunk sobers up,
he'll drink Webster coffee.

648
00:54:30,892 --> 00:54:32,893
Why stop at coffee ?

649
00:54:33,270 --> 00:54:37,022
A cup of coffee gets the world
off to work in the morning.

650
00:54:37,190 --> 00:54:39,316
But what keeps the world working ?

651
00:54:40,151 --> 00:54:41,193
Diet soda ?

652
00:54:42,445 --> 00:54:44,530
Vera, you mean ? You mean ?

653
00:54:44,698 --> 00:54:47,157
Today, coffee.

654
00:54:47,325 --> 00:54:49,868
Tomorrow, the oil !

655
00:54:50,036 --> 00:54:52,538
- Oil ?
- Lf Gus can push the right buttons...

656
00:54:52,706 --> 00:54:55,457
I can have it all. Holy cats !

657
00:54:55,667 --> 00:54:57,209
All the oil.

658
00:54:57,460 --> 00:54:58,669
All the pumps.

659
00:54:58,878 --> 00:55:00,296
All the tankers.

660
00:55:00,505 --> 00:55:02,047
This is some nifty idea, Vera.

661
00:55:02,215 --> 00:55:03,882
- Boss ?
- Very nifty.

662
00:55:04,050 --> 00:55:06,719
- Just the man I want to see.
- Boss, it is not my fault.

663
00:55:06,886 --> 00:55:08,512
Isn't it neat ? There...

664
00:55:08,722 --> 00:55:10,556
- What's not your fault ?
- Superman.

665
00:55:11,308 --> 00:55:13,892
How was I to know he was
gonna start doing his thing...

666
00:55:14,060 --> 00:55:16,186
when you started doing your thing ?

667
00:55:16,396 --> 00:55:19,148
- What are you talking about ?
- What am I talk ?

668
00:55:19,357 --> 00:55:22,234
It was just on television, man.
Didn't you see it ?

669
00:55:22,444 --> 00:55:23,819
Don't call me "man".

670
00:55:24,029 --> 00:55:26,238
I just saw Colombia
bite the dust. That's all.

671
00:55:26,489 --> 00:55:30,743
You didn't see the man come flying out
of the sky from the clouds ? It was him !

672
00:55:31,244 --> 00:55:33,454
With his cape flapping in the...

673
00:55:38,043 --> 00:55:39,877
His cape was flapping in the wind !

674
00:55:40,086 --> 00:55:42,338
He was flying ! He was great !

675
00:55:42,547 --> 00:55:44,340
He was just flying around...

676
00:55:44,591 --> 00:55:47,968
His cape was blowing in the wind
like this. It looked like a flag !

677
00:55:49,179 --> 00:55:52,097
And he landed right in the middle
of this big plantation !

678
00:55:54,476 --> 00:55:57,686
And he checked everything out
with his x-ray vision.

679
00:55:57,896 --> 00:56:02,441
And then he put these laser beams
out of his eyes onto everything.

680
00:56:03,234 --> 00:56:04,777
Straight-out laser points.

681
00:56:05,487 --> 00:56:07,279
Dried up everything !

682
00:56:07,489 --> 00:56:08,947
Just like that !

683
00:56:09,115 --> 00:56:12,242
I'm talking about drying it up,
like machines in the men's rooms.

684
00:56:12,410 --> 00:56:13,452
You know what I mean ?

685
00:56:13,620 --> 00:56:15,913
Hot air comes out when you put
your hands under.

686
00:56:16,081 --> 00:56:17,790
Sometimes they don't work, right ?

687
00:56:17,957 --> 00:56:19,291
But Superman's worked !

688
00:56:19,501 --> 00:56:22,503
You think he stood around
to take bows ? Not this man.

689
00:56:22,712 --> 00:56:25,297
No, sir. He flies off again. Right ?

690
00:56:25,507 --> 00:56:27,966
Then he saw what
really caused the trouble.

691
00:56:28,134 --> 00:56:29,927
He flew into the tornado...

692
00:56:30,136 --> 00:56:33,764
went down to the bottom of it,
and turned it upside down !

693
00:56:33,973 --> 00:56:37,309
He made the little end on top
and the big end on the bottom !

694
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:39,978
I was gonna go crazy !

695
00:56:40,146 --> 00:56:43,065
I've never seen nothing like it.

696
00:56:43,775 --> 00:56:45,317
The big end was on the bottom.

697
00:56:45,568 --> 00:56:47,277
Little end on the top.

698
00:56:48,238 --> 00:56:50,656
Mr. Ross, it was... The big...

699
00:56:53,535 --> 00:56:54,785
Superman's bad.

700
00:56:55,829 --> 00:56:57,287
I'll say he was.

701
00:56:57,455 --> 00:56:59,665
I mean, he was bad !

702
00:56:59,999 --> 00:57:02,418
No.

703
00:57:02,585 --> 00:57:03,961
No !

704
00:57:04,671 --> 00:57:06,004
Here, let me help.

705
00:57:06,172 --> 00:57:09,508
- It was a perfect plan. It was foolproof !
- And we were the fools.

706
00:57:09,676 --> 00:57:13,554
It's not my fault.
I did what I was supposed to do.

707
00:57:14,055 --> 00:57:17,683
He ruined it.
That lousy do-gooder ruined it.

708
00:57:19,185 --> 00:57:23,856
Now that he's pulled off this stunt,
he'll try and ruin my oil scheme too.

709
00:57:25,859 --> 00:57:27,526
- I've got to get rid of him.
- How ?

710
00:57:27,694 --> 00:57:29,862
Shoot him ? You know
about him and bullets.

711
00:57:30,363 --> 00:57:32,322
- Kryptonite.
- What ?

712
00:57:33,658 --> 00:57:37,077
Or krypton-ham, or krypton-heimer ?

713
00:57:37,370 --> 00:57:40,539
I forget what you call it,
but it's stuff that can hurt Superman.

714
00:57:40,707 --> 00:57:43,542
- How would you know about that ?
- I know a few things.

715
00:57:43,710 --> 00:57:45,335
I know, from the graffiti I saw.

716
00:57:45,503 --> 00:57:46,879
Wait a second.

717
00:57:47,088 --> 00:57:48,213
She's right.

718
00:57:48,465 --> 00:57:51,675
Kryptonite. I remember reading
about it in an interview with him.

719
00:57:51,843 --> 00:57:53,093
Where does it come from ?

720
00:57:53,303 --> 00:57:55,554
The same planet Superman
came from... Krypton.

721
00:57:55,722 --> 00:57:57,222
Where is Krypton ?

722
00:57:57,390 --> 00:57:58,724
It's nowhere.

723
00:57:58,892 --> 00:58:00,559
It blew up in space, years ago.

724
00:58:00,727 --> 00:58:04,229
They sent Superman here from there
when he was just a baby.

725
00:58:04,397 --> 00:58:05,564
I know some things too.

726
00:58:05,732 --> 00:58:09,234
Wait a minute. You know
what happens when a planet explodes.

727
00:58:09,402 --> 00:58:12,988
- Debris. Things floating in space.
- So ?

728
00:58:13,198 --> 00:58:17,075
So all we have to do is find out
where in heaven Krypton used to be.

729
00:58:17,243 --> 00:58:20,204
Then we get good old Gus
to contact the Vulcan satellite.

730
00:58:20,413 --> 00:58:22,539
Old Gus has been doing some thinking.

731
00:58:22,707 --> 00:58:24,625
Good. That's why I keep you around.

732
00:58:25,084 --> 00:58:29,129
Yeah. I've been thinking that I'm not
making enough money for this gig.

733
00:58:29,756 --> 00:58:33,133
Gus, if there's anything I hate...

734
00:58:33,885 --> 00:58:35,093
it's greed.

735
00:58:35,261 --> 00:58:38,388
Greed ? Mr. Ross, just a minute.

736
00:58:38,598 --> 00:58:40,432
Let me tell you something.

737
00:58:40,934 --> 00:58:42,392
I can't ski !

738
00:59:14,968 --> 00:59:17,135
Once Gus contacts
the Vulcan satellite...

739
00:59:17,303 --> 00:59:19,304
he orders it to search
through space...

740
00:59:19,472 --> 00:59:22,266
around where Krypton
went bye-bye.

741
00:59:31,734 --> 00:59:35,320
Then the laser probe locks
on to a floating chunk of Kryptonite.

742
00:59:35,488 --> 00:59:37,573
The computer analyzes
the components...

743
00:59:37,782 --> 00:59:41,076
and the boys at the lab
duplicate the stuff down here.

744
00:59:41,661 --> 00:59:43,495
"Unknown" ?

745
00:59:43,955 --> 00:59:45,497
"Unknown" ?

746
01:00:02,724 --> 01:00:04,850
What the hell,
he ain't gonna smoke it.

747
01:00:10,857 --> 01:00:13,358
Mr. White can't be responsible.

748
01:00:15,612 --> 01:00:16,820
Where is he ?

749
01:00:17,030 --> 01:00:18,614
Please, Mr. Stokis.

750
01:00:19,032 --> 01:00:20,741
He'll pay for this.

751
01:00:22,243 --> 01:00:23,785
Get out your wallet !

752
01:00:24,787 --> 01:00:28,040
- Good morning.
- Don't you "good morning" me.

753
01:00:29,500 --> 01:00:33,712
"Old, old relationships
suddenly seem very much the same.

754
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:35,547
The prettiest girl in the school..."

755
01:00:37,383 --> 01:00:39,676
is still the prettiest girl
in the school.

756
01:00:44,265 --> 01:00:47,517
- Hello ?
- Hello. Oh, hi, Clark.

757
01:00:47,727 --> 01:00:52,272
Lana ! Hi, I was just
thinking about you.

758
01:00:52,482 --> 01:00:53,815
Oh, um...

759
01:00:54,025 --> 01:00:56,193
Listen, I have a problem with Ricky.

760
01:00:56,361 --> 01:00:57,694
Why ? What happened to Ricky ?

761
01:00:57,862 --> 01:01:01,406
It's Superman's autograph you got him.
He got carried away...

762
01:01:01,574 --> 01:01:04,576
and told the kids Superman
was coming on his birthday.

763
01:01:04,827 --> 01:01:06,078
Okay, it was wrong...

764
01:01:06,245 --> 01:01:09,915
but when Wednesday comes and
Superman doesn't show, it's gonna...

765
01:01:10,917 --> 01:01:14,544
Well, Lana, in this case I think
I can go ahead and speak for Superman.

766
01:01:14,712 --> 01:01:16,797
I mean, he and I
are pretty close, you know.

767
01:01:17,006 --> 01:01:21,051
And you can tell Ricky that Superman
will be there on Wednesday, all right ?

768
01:01:22,804 --> 01:01:26,223
Well, he's gonna get the best
home-cooked meal he's had...

769
01:01:26,599 --> 01:01:27,766
in a long time.

770
01:01:27,934 --> 01:01:30,936
- Tell Superman we think he's wonderful.
- All right.

771
01:01:31,104 --> 01:01:33,230
- But, Clark...
- Yeah ?

772
01:01:33,606 --> 01:01:34,940
you're the best.

773
01:01:39,445 --> 01:01:42,406
And I'll take it to
the Supreme Court if I have to.

774
01:01:42,615 --> 01:01:45,909
But it wasn't our fault.
It was an act of God.

775
01:01:46,119 --> 01:01:47,911
In a church ?

776
01:02:00,550 --> 01:02:01,633
Hey !

777
01:02:01,843 --> 01:02:03,802
Here's that compound you ordered.

778
01:02:03,970 --> 01:02:05,887
Can't imagine what you want with it.

779
01:02:06,055 --> 01:02:07,431
But you got it.

780
01:02:13,730 --> 01:02:16,648
What the hell am I afraid for ?
I'm from Earth.

781
01:02:22,363 --> 01:02:24,489
Lana, I really wasn't expecting all this.

782
01:02:24,741 --> 01:02:27,284
I guess they did get
a little carried away.

783
01:02:41,132 --> 01:02:44,384
Superman, we all know...

784
01:02:45,011 --> 01:02:47,763
that you're not looking
for honors and awards.

785
01:02:48,598 --> 01:02:52,184
But when we heard that you were
coming to see your pal Ricky...

786
01:02:52,393 --> 01:02:56,188
we realized that this was
our chance to say thank you.

787
01:02:56,397 --> 01:02:58,774
First, for putting out
the Lake Comooga fire.

788
01:02:59,275 --> 01:03:02,527
And not least,
for saving little Ricky.

789
01:03:03,029 --> 01:03:05,697
So since you already have
the key to our hearts...

790
01:03:05,865 --> 01:03:08,033
Superman...

791
01:03:08,201 --> 01:03:12,287
may I present you
with the key to the city.

792
01:03:12,497 --> 01:03:13,872
Thank you, sir.

793
01:03:17,919 --> 01:03:19,127
Thank you.

794
01:03:35,561 --> 01:03:37,229
As you were.

795
01:03:40,233 --> 01:03:41,566
Now listen up.

796
01:03:42,068 --> 01:03:43,902
I just came in directly...

797
01:03:44,070 --> 01:03:46,238
from the Pentagon...

798
01:03:46,489 --> 01:03:50,575
and you better believe there's
a damn good reason that I did.

799
01:03:51,577 --> 01:03:53,912
Because God has given us...

800
01:03:54,080 --> 01:03:57,582
one of the greatest gifts in the world...

801
01:03:57,959 --> 01:03:59,709
Chemicals.

802
01:04:00,711 --> 01:04:05,340
Now, you people, you like to go sit
in church on Sunday, don't you ?

803
01:04:05,716 --> 01:04:08,176
You like to sit and watch
the Super Bowl.

804
01:04:08,344 --> 01:04:09,427
Yeah.

805
01:04:09,595 --> 01:04:11,680
Sit on what ?!

806
01:04:13,057 --> 01:04:17,269
You sit on molded, plastic seats !

807
01:04:18,062 --> 01:04:21,606
Molded to your well-fed behinds.

808
01:04:23,109 --> 01:04:27,445
Now, I don't have to tell you
that America leads the world...

809
01:04:27,613 --> 01:04:28,989
in high-grade plastics.

810
01:04:29,448 --> 01:04:33,785
We cannot afford
a chemical-plastics gap.

811
01:04:35,037 --> 01:04:36,246
Now, listen to me.

812
01:04:36,998 --> 01:04:38,623
Do you want...

813
01:04:38,791 --> 01:04:43,211
our president of the United States
sitting down...

814
01:04:44,005 --> 01:04:45,964
to write a peace treaty...

815
01:04:46,132 --> 01:04:49,050
and have his ballpoint pen bust open...

816
01:04:49,260 --> 01:04:52,470
and the ink run out all over
his nice, clean pants...

817
01:04:52,638 --> 01:04:54,472
in front of the world leaders ?

818
01:04:54,640 --> 01:04:56,516
No. No.

819
01:04:57,018 --> 01:04:58,810
Now, we all know...

820
01:04:59,020 --> 01:05:03,315
that last week, half of
this great nation of ours...

821
01:05:03,566 --> 01:05:05,150
almost bit the bullet...

822
01:05:05,818 --> 01:05:08,278
if it wasn't for this man here.

823
01:05:10,448 --> 01:05:14,826
And all I can say is,
thank the Lord for Superman.

824
01:05:20,791 --> 01:05:22,918
Superman, you saved our bacon...

825
01:05:23,127 --> 01:05:25,420
and I'd like to show our gratitude.

826
01:05:28,549 --> 01:05:32,928
This is a small token
of our appreciation...

827
01:05:33,137 --> 01:05:37,766
to show to you for saving us
from a chemical-plant disaster.

828
01:05:44,023 --> 01:05:45,690
Thank you very much, general.

829
01:05:46,192 --> 01:05:48,360
This is very nice. Thank you.

830
01:05:59,789 --> 01:06:00,830
It's very nice.

831
01:06:08,214 --> 01:06:11,883
Unknown. How am I supposed
to know what "unknown" means ?

832
01:06:12,134 --> 01:06:15,178
It means unknown. It means
nobody knows what it means.

833
01:06:15,346 --> 01:06:17,555
- Hello, boss ?
- Gus ?

834
01:06:18,057 --> 01:06:20,892
- Gus Gorman here.
- I know that. How did it go ?

835
01:06:21,602 --> 01:06:25,188
You know how they're always
trying to find the secret recipe...

836
01:06:25,398 --> 01:06:27,190
in that chicken in the bucket ?

837
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:29,401
And nobody seems to know
the ingredient...

838
01:06:29,610 --> 01:06:31,736
because it's unknown, right ?

839
01:06:32,405 --> 01:06:36,741
In the Kryptonite there was an unknown
element and Superman didn't die.

840
01:06:37,618 --> 01:06:39,744
He didn't die.

841
01:06:40,413 --> 01:06:43,081
I ask you to kill Superman...

842
01:06:43,249 --> 01:06:47,419
and you're telling me you couldn't
even do that one simple thing.

843
01:06:51,757 --> 01:06:52,882
Hello ?

844
01:07:06,772 --> 01:07:09,357
He hasn't had
an afternoon nap for years.

845
01:07:09,567 --> 01:07:13,236
This is the biggest day of his life.
I don't know how to thank you.

846
01:07:13,404 --> 01:07:15,071
You did with that wonderful lunch.

847
01:07:15,239 --> 01:07:18,450
Oh, well, I do like to cook.

848
01:07:19,452 --> 01:07:21,453
- You'll take some coffee ?
- Yes, please.

849
01:07:21,662 --> 01:07:23,788
- Decaffeinated, of course.
- Right.

850
01:07:28,794 --> 01:07:31,296
Hello ? Yes.

851
01:07:32,965 --> 01:07:34,299
What ?

852
01:07:34,675 --> 01:07:36,551
Oh, really ?

853
01:07:36,761 --> 01:07:37,969
Yeah, he's here.

854
01:07:38,137 --> 01:07:40,138
I'll tell him.
Okay, thanks. Bye-bye.

855
01:07:40,306 --> 01:07:43,266
Superman, that was my friend Betty.

856
01:07:43,476 --> 01:07:46,978
There's an accident on the bridge.
A trailer crashed through the rail.

857
01:07:47,146 --> 01:07:50,231
It's hanging off the bridge
and the driver's in the cab.

858
01:07:50,775 --> 01:07:53,193
I'm sorry.
I hate to make you rush off.

859
01:07:53,819 --> 01:07:55,153
Well, there's no rush.

860
01:07:55,821 --> 01:07:59,574
- But the bridge...
- It's okay. I always get there on time.

861
01:07:59,784 --> 01:08:01,451
Come on, let's relax a little.

862
01:08:15,299 --> 01:08:18,802
It's unusual finding a good-looking girl
like you alone like this.

863
01:08:29,438 --> 01:08:34,359
Listen, are you sure you shouldn't
do something about the bridge ?

864
01:08:35,027 --> 01:08:36,194
What bridge ?

865
01:08:41,534 --> 01:08:42,659
You're right.

866
01:08:46,872 --> 01:08:48,623
I have to get going.

867
01:08:57,550 --> 01:08:59,175
Get him out of there. Come on.

868
01:08:59,385 --> 01:09:01,010
Get him out ! Get him out quick !

869
01:09:01,220 --> 01:09:03,888
Come on. Get him away.
That thing's gonna go.

870
01:09:18,779 --> 01:09:20,822
Everybody okay ? Joe ?

871
01:09:21,574 --> 01:09:22,824
What can I do to help ?

872
01:09:23,033 --> 01:09:24,534
Not much of anything now.

873
01:09:24,743 --> 01:09:27,287
If only you'd got here
a minute sooner.

874
01:10:42,655 --> 01:10:45,198
"At a special session
of the General Assembly...

875
01:10:45,366 --> 01:10:48,618
178 countries voted
to censure Superman...

876
01:10:48,786 --> 01:10:51,246
with only Colombia abstaining".

877
01:10:51,413 --> 01:10:52,914
I can tell you one thing.

878
01:10:53,123 --> 01:10:56,960
He wasn't so mean and nasty
the other day in Smallville.

879
01:10:57,169 --> 01:10:59,587
In fact, he was so full of niceness...

880
01:10:59,755 --> 01:11:02,131
I hated laying that big chunk of...

881
01:11:03,842 --> 01:11:05,843
Kryptonite. Don't you see ?

882
01:11:06,011 --> 01:11:09,347
That stuff we ran off in the lab
wasn't a complete failure after all.

883
01:11:09,515 --> 01:11:12,392
Right after Gus gave it to him,
he started to turn into...

884
01:11:12,601 --> 01:11:14,686
an ornery, evil, malicious, selfish...

885
01:11:14,895 --> 01:11:16,813
- A normal person.
- Yes.

886
01:11:17,398 --> 01:11:20,942
And now that Superman
is out of the nice-guy business...

887
01:11:21,110 --> 01:11:22,819
We can get to work on that oil.

888
01:11:46,552 --> 01:11:50,722
And now, the supreme
moment, as the last runner...

889
01:11:50,889 --> 01:11:54,851
the one given the great honor
of lighting the ceremonial flame...

890
01:11:55,019 --> 01:11:59,147
runs the last leg of a marathon
that began seven days ago...

891
01:11:59,356 --> 01:12:04,068
as this torch has been passed
from athlete to athlete...

892
01:12:04,278 --> 01:12:07,030
for 970 miles...

893
01:12:07,197 --> 01:12:09,032
across the country.

894
01:12:50,199 --> 01:12:53,493
How can he say that pure categories
have no objective meaning...

895
01:12:53,702 --> 01:12:56,537
in transcendental logic ?
What about synthetic unity ?

896
01:12:59,416 --> 01:13:01,167
Hi, honey ! Am I in your way ?

897
01:13:01,335 --> 01:13:04,295
- Stick around, you may learn something.
- Hi, Lorelei.

898
01:13:04,463 --> 01:13:08,132
All the oil tankers in the world
are totally controlled by computers.

899
01:13:08,300 --> 01:13:11,177
They tell them where to go,
how much oil to pick up...

900
01:13:11,387 --> 01:13:13,096
and where to deliver it.

901
01:13:13,263 --> 01:13:15,139
Don't they have captains
on these ships ?

902
01:13:15,307 --> 01:13:16,766
Yes, but they don't need them.

903
01:13:16,934 --> 01:13:20,228
That's a throwback to some
sentimental, seafaring baloney.

904
01:13:20,396 --> 01:13:24,107
You will command the tankers
to sail toward a 50-mile area...

905
01:13:24,274 --> 01:13:26,150
in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean.

906
01:13:26,318 --> 01:13:27,985
And do what ?

907
01:13:28,153 --> 01:13:30,363
And do nothing.

908
01:13:30,572 --> 01:13:32,824
Just sit there.

909
01:13:33,992 --> 01:13:36,869
How are all the people
gonna get their oil ?

910
01:13:38,038 --> 01:13:40,456
You catch on fast, old buddy.

911
01:13:43,168 --> 01:13:46,337
Every oil pump in America is run by...

912
01:13:46,547 --> 01:13:49,298
- Computers. I know.
- Will you stop interrupting ?!

913
01:13:49,508 --> 01:13:50,675
I'm sorry.

914
01:13:51,009 --> 01:13:54,804
You will command the pumps
to stop pumping.

915
01:13:54,972 --> 01:13:58,891
Then I want you to program
one special command...

916
01:13:59,101 --> 01:14:01,185
into all these systems.

917
01:14:01,353 --> 01:14:04,147
Tell them these orders
are irreversible.

918
01:14:04,356 --> 01:14:08,109
So it would be impossible
for anybody to switch them back.

919
01:14:08,318 --> 01:14:10,194
Can you do this for me, old buddy ?

920
01:14:10,737 --> 01:14:12,613
Old pal ?

921
01:14:19,955 --> 01:14:22,373
You know, you get your way
all the time.

922
01:14:23,542 --> 01:14:25,334
And it's not right.

923
01:14:27,754 --> 01:14:29,881
I wanna know when I get a taste.

924
01:14:36,346 --> 01:14:40,600
I think you've already had
a taste of freedom, haven't you ?

925
01:14:40,809 --> 01:14:43,352
Or would you prefer jail ?

926
01:14:43,562 --> 01:14:45,396
You can't run that jail number on me.

927
01:14:45,731 --> 01:14:49,317
Because I know I mean more to you
out here doing things for you...

928
01:14:49,526 --> 01:14:52,236
than sitting in jail
doing nothing for nobody.

929
01:14:53,989 --> 01:14:55,072
I see.

930
01:14:55,240 --> 01:14:57,074
What do you want ?

931
01:15:03,415 --> 01:15:05,875
What ? A wastebasket ?

932
01:15:06,084 --> 01:15:08,211
No. These are plans.

933
01:15:09,087 --> 01:15:10,588
Blueprints.

934
01:15:11,131 --> 01:15:13,216
- For what ?
- A computer.

935
01:15:13,383 --> 01:15:16,219
- We've already got computers.
- No, not like this.

936
01:15:16,386 --> 01:15:19,931
There's not a computer like this
in the whole world anyplace.

937
01:15:20,474 --> 01:15:22,350
It doesn't exist. You see...

938
01:15:22,643 --> 01:15:23,935
we have to build it.

939
01:15:24,478 --> 01:15:25,561
What will it do ?

940
01:15:25,896 --> 01:15:27,730
Anything I tell it.

941
01:15:28,273 --> 01:15:30,441
What will it do for me ?

942
01:15:30,609 --> 01:15:34,904
For you ? It will do anything you
tell me to tell it to do for you.

943
01:15:35,155 --> 01:15:36,489
Wow.

944
01:15:41,286 --> 01:15:42,870
Tell me.

945
01:15:44,790 --> 01:15:48,084
First of all, if anyone attacks
this machine or anything...

946
01:15:48,293 --> 01:15:50,169
the computer counterattacks it.

947
01:15:50,379 --> 01:15:53,381
I mean, it finds their weaknesses
and wipes them out.

948
01:15:53,882 --> 01:15:54,966
Right, old buddy.

949
01:15:55,175 --> 01:15:58,970
You deal with my oil
and I'll build you your machine.

950
01:16:02,641 --> 01:16:04,308
Okay, I'll do it.

951
01:16:04,476 --> 01:16:08,020
But I'm not so sure about
this irreversible business.

952
01:16:25,163 --> 01:16:27,832
They all kind of went...
What the hell ?

953
01:16:31,253 --> 01:16:33,713
That's it. The last tanker.

954
01:16:34,423 --> 01:16:37,341
They're all mine now. All mine.

955
01:16:37,884 --> 01:16:39,385
Yay.

956
01:16:39,595 --> 01:16:41,846
Not quite.

957
01:16:42,014 --> 01:16:44,515
What's that in
the upper-middle quadrant ?

958
01:16:45,517 --> 01:16:47,018
It's a tanker.

959
01:16:49,146 --> 01:16:51,063
And it's going the wrong way.

960
01:17:01,867 --> 01:17:03,034
Skipper ?

961
01:17:03,201 --> 01:17:05,870
There it is again.
"Proceed immediately to...

962
01:17:06,079 --> 01:17:09,165
latitude 30 north, longitude 45 west.

963
01:17:10,876 --> 01:17:12,543
There await further orders".

964
01:17:12,711 --> 01:17:14,879
Hell, that's the middle of the Atlantic.

965
01:17:15,047 --> 01:17:17,965
I'm not taking my ship there
just to await further orders...

966
01:17:18,175 --> 01:17:19,717
no matter what that says.

967
01:17:19,926 --> 01:17:23,554
We're supposed to go to Metropolis,
and we're going to Metropolis.

968
01:17:23,722 --> 01:17:25,014
All right.

969
01:17:37,402 --> 01:17:38,736
That's where she is. Yeah.

970
01:17:38,904 --> 01:17:40,988
Come on, get it up there.

971
01:17:42,407 --> 01:17:43,783
Miss ?

972
01:17:44,326 --> 01:17:46,577
Miss, can you hear me ?

973
01:17:46,745 --> 01:17:49,413
Listen, we are here to help you.

974
01:17:49,623 --> 01:17:53,084
Don't jump. I repeat, do not jump !

975
01:17:54,711 --> 01:17:56,087
Thought you'd never get here.

976
01:17:56,963 --> 01:17:59,715
Don't expect me to save you.
I don't do that anymore.

977
01:17:59,925 --> 01:18:01,008
Don't worry.

978
01:18:01,176 --> 01:18:03,928
I'm long past saving.

979
01:18:08,809 --> 01:18:10,267
Well...

980
01:18:10,936 --> 01:18:12,770
don't let me keep you
from anything.

981
01:18:13,438 --> 01:18:15,022
I'm not in a rush.

982
01:18:20,862 --> 01:18:22,822
What did you have in mind ?

983
01:18:23,198 --> 01:18:24,782
Lots of things.

984
01:18:24,950 --> 01:18:26,242
Oh, yeah ?

985
01:18:27,744 --> 01:18:29,078
Ooo...

986
01:18:29,329 --> 01:18:32,248
If you'll just do me
one little favor first.

987
01:18:32,457 --> 01:18:33,791
What's that ?

988
01:18:34,292 --> 01:18:36,043
Well...

989
01:18:36,586 --> 01:18:38,796
See, there's this little boat...

990
01:18:39,005 --> 01:18:42,717
and it's not going where
it's supposed to go and...

991
01:19:19,337 --> 01:19:21,005
Stop all engines !

992
01:19:22,007 --> 01:19:23,674
Stop all engines !

993
01:20:17,062 --> 01:20:18,562
Hi.

994
01:20:34,120 --> 01:20:36,539
How about a little après-ski ?

995
01:20:47,509 --> 01:20:48,926
Champagne ?

996
01:21:12,701 --> 01:21:14,535
Take your turn like everybody else !

997
01:21:14,744 --> 01:21:16,787
Stop it !

998
01:21:19,541 --> 01:21:21,584
He's coming over here, Martha.

999
01:21:25,130 --> 01:21:26,547
Don't you do that !

1000
01:21:28,133 --> 01:21:30,217
Don't ! Please !

1001
01:21:36,433 --> 01:21:38,392
Hit him with your handbag !

1002
01:21:41,980 --> 01:21:45,316
Help me ! Please, help me.
Somebody's beating up my husband.

1003
01:21:45,483 --> 01:21:49,111
- I've gotta call the police.
- Jack, go with her, okay ?

1004
01:21:50,155 --> 01:21:52,656
The third one today,
and at night it's worse.

1005
01:21:52,866 --> 01:21:54,658
Somebody's behind this.

1006
01:21:54,868 --> 01:21:56,619
You can't tell me there's no oil.

1007
01:21:56,786 --> 01:21:59,163
You can't say someone's
not getting rich off this.

1008
01:21:59,372 --> 01:22:01,206
Someone's always getting rich.

1009
01:22:01,416 --> 01:22:03,417
You know who suffers ? The small guy.

1010
01:22:03,627 --> 01:22:06,837
The East Coast gets
the brunt of the spill.

1011
01:22:49,547 --> 01:22:52,091
No, I cannot go out with you tonight.

1012
01:22:52,550 --> 01:22:54,093
No. I'm busy tomorrow night too.

1013
01:22:54,260 --> 01:22:56,053
Oh, yeah ? Doing what ?

1014
01:22:56,471 --> 01:22:58,305
I'll think of something. Look...

1015
01:22:58,515 --> 01:23:01,684
- I gotta go. Ricky needs me.
- Lana.

1016
01:23:01,851 --> 01:23:04,979
Brad, please stop calling me.
I've told you !

1017
01:23:05,146 --> 01:23:07,231
Well, you listen to me, huh ?

1018
01:23:07,399 --> 01:23:09,400
You better start appreciating old Brad.

1019
01:23:09,818 --> 01:23:11,360
What else you got in Smallville ?

1020
01:23:17,283 --> 01:23:19,827
What else have I got in Smallville ?

1021
01:23:21,371 --> 01:23:23,372
I think I got the right answer.

1022
01:23:24,040 --> 01:23:25,416
So do I.

1023
01:23:34,509 --> 01:23:38,220
Smallville Airport, what flights
do you have to Metropolis tomorrow ?

1024
01:23:43,852 --> 01:23:46,395
- Where do I put this ?
- Over there.

1025
01:23:48,106 --> 01:23:51,150
- Where do you want this ?
- Put it up there.

1026
01:23:54,446 --> 01:23:57,281
Are you kidding ? I'm not going in there.

1027
01:24:18,303 --> 01:24:20,637
Hey, hey. Come on.

1028
01:24:29,147 --> 01:24:30,314
Just leave him alone.

1029
01:24:52,087 --> 01:24:54,213
I can't get through.
Something's happening.

1030
01:24:54,422 --> 01:24:56,215
Hey, look ! Superman's drunk !

1031
01:24:56,424 --> 01:24:59,510
- I wanna see what's happening here.
- Ricky. Ricky !

1032
01:25:00,095 --> 01:25:03,013
- Ricky.
- Yeah, that's right.

1033
01:25:03,556 --> 01:25:05,849
- Thank you.
- It's a disgrace, that's what it is.

1034
01:25:06,017 --> 01:25:08,852
I'll tell you, nobody's ever
gonna trust that creep again.

1035
01:25:09,020 --> 01:25:10,479
He's washed up.

1036
01:25:13,983 --> 01:25:16,693
What are you looking at ? Huh ?

1037
01:25:17,070 --> 01:25:20,280
Excuse me. Superman ? It's me, Ricky.

1038
01:25:20,490 --> 01:25:22,157
Ricky from Smallville.

1039
01:25:22,367 --> 01:25:24,118
Tell them you won't hurt anybody !

1040
01:25:24,327 --> 01:25:25,494
He's changed.

1041
01:25:25,662 --> 01:25:28,330
No ! Maybe he's just sick.

1042
01:25:28,540 --> 01:25:30,374
Superman, please get better !

1043
01:25:30,583 --> 01:25:32,042
He's not listening to you.

1044
01:25:32,210 --> 01:25:36,046
Yes, he is. He can hear me.
He's got super-hearing.

1045
01:25:36,214 --> 01:25:38,841
Superman, you're just in a slump !

1046
01:25:39,008 --> 01:25:40,759
You'll be great again !

1047
01:25:40,969 --> 01:25:42,469
You can do it, Superman !

1048
01:25:42,679 --> 01:25:45,639
Superman, you can hear me, can't you ?

1049
01:25:45,849 --> 01:25:48,392
Superman, you're just in a slump.

1050
01:25:48,560 --> 01:25:52,187
You'll be great again.
You can do it, superman.

1051
01:25:52,355 --> 01:25:55,399
Superman, you can hear me, can't you ?

1052
01:26:15,587 --> 01:26:16,628
He's gone nuts !

1053
01:26:18,506 --> 01:26:19,548
Come on !

1054
01:27:46,511 --> 01:27:48,470
I can give as good as I get.

1055
01:27:49,597 --> 01:27:52,599
Oh, yeah ? All right, come on ! Come on !

1056
01:27:52,767 --> 01:27:54,518
Come on ! Come on !

1057
01:28:20,003 --> 01:28:22,629
What's the matter, Kent ?
Too warm for you, huh ?

1058
01:28:24,757 --> 01:28:27,551
Come on, chicken ! Come and get me.

1059
01:28:27,719 --> 01:28:30,012
You've been on my nerves a long time !

1060
01:28:51,909 --> 01:28:53,994
You always wanted to fly, Kent.

1061
01:28:54,203 --> 01:28:55,412
Now's your chance.

1062
01:33:49,540 --> 01:33:51,041
Skipper !

1063
01:34:05,681 --> 01:34:08,058
God, would you look at that !

1064
01:34:55,481 --> 01:34:58,108
Miss Lorelei Ambrosia
isn't at home right now.

1065
01:34:58,317 --> 01:35:00,527
But if you'd care to leave a message...

1066
01:35:00,736 --> 01:35:04,114
why not deliver it to her in person ?

1067
01:35:04,281 --> 01:35:07,659
So you've finally shown
your true colors.

1068
01:35:07,868 --> 01:35:12,122
Well, if you're looking for us,
here's where you'll find us.

1069
01:35:12,331 --> 01:35:14,040
Do drop in.

1070
01:35:20,631 --> 01:35:22,298
Wow, this is fun !

1071
01:35:22,717 --> 01:35:24,759
Fun ? The fun's just starting.

1072
01:35:25,344 --> 01:35:28,179
Wait till Superman finds us,
then you'll see some fun.

1073
01:35:28,389 --> 01:35:30,765
Wait, you gonna mess with Superman ?

1074
01:35:31,058 --> 01:35:35,061
Let's go. I want to be ready for him
when he falls into our trap.

1075
01:35:35,354 --> 01:35:39,190
I just don't see why you can't
balloon down like the rest of us.

1076
01:35:39,400 --> 01:35:40,483
Well...

1077
01:35:42,319 --> 01:35:43,445
No way.

1078
01:35:43,654 --> 01:35:46,156
I just don't believe a man can fly.

1079
01:36:03,340 --> 01:36:05,341
Watch out, horsy !

1080
01:36:15,060 --> 01:36:17,187
Don't, don't, don't.

1081
01:36:17,354 --> 01:36:19,773
Just don't try to fly.

1082
01:36:20,024 --> 01:36:21,483
Don't try to fly !

1083
01:36:34,705 --> 01:36:37,165
Will you get out of my way !

1084
01:36:55,976 --> 01:36:58,311
- Hurry ! Hurry up !
- I am hurrying.

1085
01:37:03,901 --> 01:37:06,194
- I can't see anything.
- Turn on the light.

1086
01:37:06,362 --> 01:37:09,113
- Where's the light switch ?
- Where do you usually find it ?

1087
01:37:09,323 --> 01:37:11,616
I don't know.
I guess I'll check the doorway.

1088
01:37:11,826 --> 01:37:15,703
God, it's pitch-black in here.
Oh, that's better.

1089
01:37:19,166 --> 01:37:21,918
Wow, what a jukebox !

1090
01:37:22,086 --> 01:37:24,045
I told you, didn't I ?

1091
01:37:24,213 --> 01:37:26,506
There. The ultimate computer !

1092
01:37:33,681 --> 01:37:37,433
It does everything a computer can do
and 1000 things none of them can do.

1093
01:37:37,643 --> 01:37:39,060
Let's give it a dry run.

1094
01:37:39,270 --> 01:37:41,187
Wait a minute.
We've gotta wait for Gus.

1095
01:37:41,397 --> 01:37:42,689
Who needs Gus ?

1096
01:37:42,857 --> 01:37:46,234
- He's the only one who can operate it.
- Like fish he is !

1097
01:37:46,443 --> 01:37:49,654
I know enough about computers
to put a PhD to shame.

1098
01:37:49,864 --> 01:37:52,407
Come now, brother dear,
you didn't think...

1099
01:37:52,575 --> 01:37:55,285
I was gonna let that little man
run the show, did you ?

1100
01:37:55,661 --> 01:37:57,704
Why don't peons tidy up
when they're done ?

1101
01:37:57,913 --> 01:38:00,707
Come on, Bubba, it's showtime.

1102
01:38:04,128 --> 01:38:06,796
Engage those buttons
to activate the alpha circuit...

1103
01:38:07,006 --> 01:38:08,381
and lock the modular grid.

1104
01:38:08,591 --> 01:38:13,469
You ! Activate circuits 29 through W-7...

1105
01:38:13,679 --> 01:38:17,765
and start full-power coordinates
on exterior defensive systems.

1106
01:38:17,975 --> 01:38:20,852
In other words, push this red button.

1107
01:38:21,687 --> 01:38:23,688
How did you know about that ?

1108
01:38:41,624 --> 01:38:42,665
He's here !

1109
01:38:42,833 --> 01:38:45,835
Good. Let's give him
something to worry about.

1110
01:38:46,921 --> 01:38:48,379
Now, let's see...

1111
01:38:48,839 --> 01:38:51,215
Tracking systems locked.

1112
01:39:16,700 --> 01:39:18,701
Let the games begin.

1113
01:39:19,703 --> 01:39:21,329
Don't tense up now, honey.

1114
01:39:53,862 --> 01:39:56,739
Come on, Bubba,
you're wasting your rockets.

1115
01:40:04,164 --> 01:40:06,249
Come on, Superman !

1116
01:40:07,334 --> 01:40:09,210
Let him have it, Ross.

1117
01:40:16,093 --> 01:40:17,927
Bubba, keep firing.

1118
01:40:18,095 --> 01:40:20,763
Keep him occupied
while I get the MX ready.

1119
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:50,209
What the hell is going on ?

1120
01:40:58,302 --> 01:41:01,971
You keep your rockets coming.
He won't notice the missile till too late !

1121
01:41:10,147 --> 01:41:12,315
So much for your catlike reflexes.

1122
01:41:22,785 --> 01:41:24,368
Oh, God !

1123
01:41:25,704 --> 01:41:27,246
Ha, ha !

1124
01:41:34,338 --> 01:41:37,298
No more. Look, you sit.

1125
01:41:37,508 --> 01:41:39,300
Sit, sit !

1126
01:41:43,013 --> 01:41:44,138
Help !

1127
01:41:44,848 --> 01:41:48,017
Hello ? Forget you, jackass !

1128
01:41:49,269 --> 01:41:50,603
That's him out of the way.

1129
01:41:50,771 --> 01:41:54,857
Sis, how would you like to control
all the world's weapons systems ?

1130
01:41:55,734 --> 01:41:56,943
Baby !

1131
01:41:57,152 --> 01:41:58,611
It's Daddy !

1132
01:41:59,696 --> 01:42:01,864
Hey, what are you doing with my baby ?

1133
01:42:02,324 --> 01:42:06,494
Gus, old buddy, genius.
Come up and join the fun.

1134
01:42:17,381 --> 01:42:20,967
He's still coming.
Arm the inner defenses.

1135
01:42:25,389 --> 01:42:26,889
All right, the game's over.

1136
01:42:27,558 --> 01:42:28,599
Hi, honey.

1137
01:42:29,143 --> 01:42:30,309
I don't know you, lady.

1138
01:42:32,354 --> 01:42:33,563
But the other night...

1139
01:42:36,191 --> 01:42:38,401
I'm sorry, but that wasn't me.

1140
01:42:38,569 --> 01:42:39,902
That guy's gone.

1141
01:42:41,697 --> 01:42:43,156
And you're next, Webster.

1142
01:42:44,283 --> 01:42:47,702
Never underestimate
the power of computers.

1143
01:42:47,995 --> 01:42:49,328
How do you like it ?

1144
01:42:49,538 --> 01:42:52,081
I think it's typical
of people like you, Webster.

1145
01:42:52,374 --> 01:42:55,751
Instead of helping others, the four
of you just wanna help yourselves.

1146
01:42:55,919 --> 01:42:58,254
Four of you ?

1147
01:42:58,422 --> 01:43:00,548
You mean, us ? Four ? Wait...

1148
01:43:00,757 --> 01:43:02,425
Hey, man !

1149
01:43:02,593 --> 01:43:06,262
That's only his last name.
He likes to be called "Superman".

1150
01:43:07,055 --> 01:43:09,682
See, I'm not with them, Superman.

1151
01:43:10,267 --> 01:43:11,684
You could've fooled me, mister.

1152
01:43:20,027 --> 01:43:21,527
That's very good.

1153
01:43:23,989 --> 01:43:27,491
Let's see how long
he can carry on without any air.

1154
01:43:49,640 --> 01:43:51,599
He's still coming !
He's going to get me !

1155
01:43:51,767 --> 01:43:52,892
Don't bet on it !

1156
01:44:05,572 --> 01:44:06,948
You're hurting him.

1157
01:44:11,036 --> 01:44:13,120
- That's Kryptonite !
- Yes.

1158
01:44:13,288 --> 01:44:15,831
- This time we got it right !
- You're a genius.

1159
01:44:16,375 --> 01:44:19,961
You've invented a machine
that can find anybody's weak spot.

1160
01:44:20,462 --> 01:44:22,004
Congratulations, old buddy.

1161
01:44:22,172 --> 01:44:25,424
You'll go down in history
as the man who killed Superman !

1162
01:44:25,634 --> 01:44:26,842
I'm... No.

1163
01:44:27,552 --> 01:44:28,844
Superman !

1164
01:44:29,012 --> 01:44:30,596
No !

1165
01:44:31,139 --> 01:44:33,432
- Where do you think you're going ?
- Never mind.

1166
01:44:33,600 --> 01:44:36,519
- Turn the power up.
- Hasn't he had enough ?

1167
01:44:40,357 --> 01:44:41,649
Turn it up !

1168
01:44:41,817 --> 01:44:43,943
Power ! More power !

1169
01:44:48,407 --> 01:44:50,283
Whoa !

1170
01:44:55,330 --> 01:44:56,622
Ow !

1171
01:45:05,382 --> 01:45:08,050
Seventy-five. Current 7.75.

1172
01:45:12,139 --> 01:45:16,892
There's a current level of 7
that is not supposed to be on bar...

1173
01:45:17,102 --> 01:45:18,686
Oh, here it is !

1174
01:45:45,339 --> 01:45:46,380
What's going on ?

1175
01:45:47,257 --> 01:45:49,091
I don't know. The power's gone.

1176
01:45:49,551 --> 01:45:51,427
Gus must have pulled the plug out.

1177
01:45:51,928 --> 01:45:53,387
It worked.

1178
01:45:53,597 --> 01:45:55,931
It worked ! I got it !

1179
01:45:59,936 --> 01:46:01,437
What have you got ?

1180
01:46:03,940 --> 01:46:05,691
- Give me that screw.
- This screw ?

1181
01:46:05,901 --> 01:46:08,027
- That screw.
- Never !

1182
01:46:12,449 --> 01:46:14,950
Hey, wait. I can't see.

1183
01:46:37,516 --> 01:46:38,641
What ?

1184
01:46:41,478 --> 01:46:42,937
Holy !

1185
01:46:43,480 --> 01:46:45,648
No ! Make it stop !

1186
01:46:47,275 --> 01:46:48,734
I can't ! It's out of control !

1187
01:46:48,944 --> 01:46:52,113
But how ? Where's it getting
the power from ?

1188
01:46:55,659 --> 01:46:57,868
It's feeding itself.

1189
01:46:58,078 --> 01:46:59,328
It wants to live !

1190
01:47:22,227 --> 01:47:24,395
It's this thing here. We'll go to the zoo.

1191
01:47:24,604 --> 01:47:27,857
I'll do that tomorrow,
and then we'll go on to the...

1192
01:47:28,984 --> 01:47:31,527
- What's happening ?
- It's okay, Ricky.

1193
01:47:31,778 --> 01:47:32,945
Put the lights on !

1194
01:47:52,883 --> 01:47:54,925
Stop it ! You're killing him !

1195
01:47:56,720 --> 01:47:58,095
Stop it !

1196
01:48:10,567 --> 01:48:11,984
Hey. Put me down !

1197
01:48:29,252 --> 01:48:32,338
Don't leave us alone in here ! Superman !

1198
01:48:36,676 --> 01:48:37,801
Oh, I get it.

1199
01:48:37,969 --> 01:48:41,555
The coaxial energy shaft is engaging
the grid source factor. Right.

1200
01:48:41,765 --> 01:48:43,599
We're through, frogface.
I'm splitting.

1201
01:48:43,767 --> 01:48:45,351
Hey, wait a minute !

1202
01:48:47,896 --> 01:48:50,564
Girls. Girls, come out of there !

1203
01:49:00,200 --> 01:49:02,451
Help me ! Please !

1204
01:49:09,125 --> 01:49:10,251
Sis ?

1205
01:49:14,089 --> 01:49:15,381
Oh, my God.

1206
01:49:22,973 --> 01:49:24,265
What is that ?

1207
01:49:35,860 --> 01:49:37,111
Lorelei !

1208
01:49:39,656 --> 01:49:41,824
Sis, it's your Bubba !

1209
01:50:19,863 --> 01:50:21,530
Help me. Help !

1210
01:50:23,742 --> 01:50:25,034
Superman !

1211
01:50:28,121 --> 01:50:29,204
Honey !

1212
01:50:29,372 --> 01:50:33,250
Honey, I'm stuck here ! Help !
What about me ?

1213
01:50:44,387 --> 01:50:45,429
Look out !

1214
01:52:54,768 --> 01:52:55,976
Bubba ?

1215
01:53:42,315 --> 01:53:44,066
Thank you, brother.

1216
01:53:51,074 --> 01:53:52,783
Regular or premium ?

1217
01:53:52,992 --> 01:53:57,079
She hasn't had a drink in so long,
give her a tankful of the good stuff.

1218
01:53:58,998 --> 01:54:00,040
How you doing ?

1219
01:54:00,208 --> 01:54:03,293
Please don't talk to me.
I'm having enough trouble hanging on.

1220
01:54:03,503 --> 01:54:06,255
Okay, we'll go slow.
You're perfectly safe.

1221
01:54:06,881 --> 01:54:08,298
I'm not gonna argue with you.

1222
01:54:08,466 --> 01:54:11,593
I mean, any man who can trick
my machine can do anything.

1223
01:54:11,761 --> 01:54:13,470
How did you beat my defenses ?

1224
01:54:13,680 --> 01:54:17,099
Those defenses are good as long
as it didn't know it's in trouble.

1225
01:54:17,308 --> 01:54:20,811
This time it didn't see the danger.
I went in with plain old acid.

1226
01:54:21,020 --> 01:54:24,648
It didn't know that when acid gets hot,
it'll eat through anything.

1227
01:54:25,191 --> 01:54:26,775
- Watch the trees.
- Whoa !

1228
01:54:27,360 --> 01:54:30,445
I guess it died of acid indigestion.

1229
01:54:31,698 --> 01:54:34,283
But what's gonna happen
to Ross and the ladies ?

1230
01:54:34,450 --> 01:54:37,995
They're gonna have to see the police.
It's not your problem anymore.

1231
01:54:39,539 --> 01:54:41,081
Are we in Metropolis yet ?

1232
01:54:41,291 --> 01:54:44,376
Nope. We're just gonna make
a little stop right over there.

1233
01:54:44,586 --> 01:54:46,503
Whoa !

1234
01:54:52,051 --> 01:54:54,595
We're on the ground, Gus.
Morning.

1235
01:54:54,762 --> 01:54:56,763
- You okay, Supe ?
- I'm fine.

1236
01:54:56,973 --> 01:54:58,140
Excuse me a second.

1237
01:55:02,478 --> 01:55:04,271
Can you guys spare one of these ?

1238
01:55:05,148 --> 01:55:07,858
- Sure, Superman.
- It is Superman, isn't it ?

1239
01:55:08,067 --> 01:55:10,068
Are you kidding ? Is that ?

1240
01:55:10,278 --> 01:55:12,988
Didn't you see us fly out of the sky ?

1241
01:55:14,198 --> 01:55:18,785
We're the only two men who can fly.
"Is it Superman ?"

1242
01:55:18,995 --> 01:55:20,495
Just right.

1243
01:55:21,331 --> 01:55:22,372
Okay, Gus, let's go.

1244
01:55:22,582 --> 01:55:25,667
I was afraid you'd say that.
I thought I'd take the bus.

1245
01:55:26,169 --> 01:55:29,504
Well, suit yourself.
Does your boss have a computer here ?

1246
01:55:29,839 --> 01:55:32,758
Yeah, he got a little bitty one
about that big.

1247
01:55:32,926 --> 01:55:36,595
You tell him he can do a lot worse
than to give Gus Gorman here a job.

1248
01:55:38,848 --> 01:55:40,432
Wow, thank you, Supe.

1249
01:55:40,767 --> 01:55:41,808
Take care.

1250
01:55:43,686 --> 01:55:45,187
I'll see you around.

1251
01:55:51,277 --> 01:55:52,361
So long.

1252
01:55:55,406 --> 01:55:57,115
Take it easy, man.

1253
01:55:58,493 --> 01:56:02,704
Well, you got good references,
so if you want that job...

1254
01:56:06,751 --> 01:56:09,544
Nah, this is not for me.
I think I'll take that bus.

1255
01:56:09,712 --> 01:56:11,630
Can you tell me
where the bus station is ?

1256
01:56:11,839 --> 01:56:14,424
Yeah, about nine, 10 miles over there.

1257
01:56:14,634 --> 01:56:19,096
Nine or 10 miles. Okay.

1258
01:56:19,263 --> 01:56:21,348
Hey. You really flew with him ?

1259
01:56:21,516 --> 01:56:24,559
Superman ? Have you ever
seen Superman before ?

1260
01:56:26,562 --> 01:56:27,604
No.

1261
01:56:27,897 --> 01:56:31,400
Oh, you don't know about me and him ?
Me and Superman ?

1262
01:56:36,572 --> 01:56:38,907
Yeah, we go way back together.

1263
01:56:39,075 --> 01:56:41,743
We always, usually, sometimes, we...

1264
01:56:43,204 --> 01:56:44,955
Nine or 10 miles ?

1265
01:56:45,498 --> 01:56:47,416
I think I'll walk.

1266
01:56:47,792 --> 01:56:49,209
Yeah, I'll walk.

1267
01:56:49,794 --> 01:56:51,003
Yeah.

1268
01:56:56,050 --> 01:56:57,259
Clark.

1269
01:56:57,593 --> 01:57:00,595
What a nice surprise ! Come in.

1270
01:57:00,763 --> 01:57:02,347
- Gosh. Hi, Mr. Kent.
- Hi, Ricky.

1271
01:57:02,515 --> 01:57:05,017
- Guess who Mom's having dinner with.
- Who ?

1272
01:57:05,226 --> 01:57:06,601
Superman !

1273
01:57:07,145 --> 01:57:09,354
Yeah, that's what I came to tell you.

1274
01:57:09,564 --> 01:57:11,440
Superman said to tell you he's sorry...

1275
01:57:11,649 --> 01:57:15,318
but he's run into a problem and he
won't be able to have dinner with you.

1276
01:57:15,486 --> 01:57:17,779
- I guess he misses a lot of dinners.
- Yeah.

1277
01:57:18,948 --> 01:57:20,824
Would you mind settling for me ?

1278
01:57:21,034 --> 01:57:22,284
Any day.

1279
01:57:23,161 --> 01:57:24,494
- I'll get my things.
- Okay.

1280
01:57:26,414 --> 01:57:29,916
You know, Lana, I was talking
to Superman the other day.

1281
01:57:30,126 --> 01:57:33,879
You know, he and I, we talk a lot.

1282
01:57:34,380 --> 01:57:37,716
And he felt badly about you having
to pawn your diamond ring.

1283
01:57:40,803 --> 01:57:42,304
Well, he found...

1284
01:57:43,514 --> 01:57:46,725
He found this one just lying around.

1285
01:57:48,019 --> 01:57:50,479
He wanted you to have this.

1286
01:57:57,320 --> 01:57:59,279
Wow, a ring from Superman !

1287
01:58:00,448 --> 01:58:02,240
- It's okay. I got it.
- Sorry.

1288
01:58:02,408 --> 01:58:03,825
Look at that.

1289
01:58:04,660 --> 01:58:06,995
- Oh, Clark.
- It's okay.

1290
01:58:07,205 --> 01:58:08,497
It fits.

1291
01:58:08,998 --> 01:58:10,332
It looks really pretty.

1292
01:58:10,500 --> 01:58:11,875
Thank you.

1293
01:58:12,919 --> 01:58:14,586
Well...

1294
01:58:14,754 --> 01:58:15,837
- Brad.
- Brad.

1295
01:58:16,297 --> 01:58:17,339
Son of a bitch.

1296
01:58:19,175 --> 01:58:21,093
Kent, I hate you.

1297
01:58:22,011 --> 01:58:23,929
I've always hated you.

1298
01:58:24,472 --> 01:58:26,223
- You know why ?
- No.

1299
01:58:26,390 --> 01:58:28,016
- Because you're nice.
- Not really.

1300
01:58:28,226 --> 01:58:29,684
And nice guys finish last.

1301
01:58:41,489 --> 01:58:43,115
Lois, I've got to hand it to you.

1302
01:58:43,324 --> 01:58:45,700
Who else could turn
a vacation into a story...

1303
01:58:45,910 --> 01:58:48,870
that'll blow the lid off
of corruption in the Caribbean ?

1304
01:58:49,080 --> 01:58:52,374
I knew I was on to something
when that taxi driver kidnapped me.

1305
01:58:52,583 --> 01:58:54,584
Lois, you're terrific.

1306
01:58:54,794 --> 01:58:58,171
I have to be. Seems I've got
some new competition.

1307
01:58:58,381 --> 01:58:59,756
Hmm ?

1308
01:59:00,091 --> 01:59:02,634
The story that you wrote
on the class reunion ?

1309
01:59:02,844 --> 01:59:04,636
- I thought it was terrific.
- Thanks.

1310
01:59:04,804 --> 01:59:08,431
And fascinating. I liked the part
about the little girl back home.

1311
01:59:08,599 --> 01:59:10,892
I'll take you to lunch
and you tell me about it.

1312
01:59:11,727 --> 01:59:15,021
I'd love to, but I'm having lunch
with Mr. White's new secretary.

1313
01:59:15,189 --> 01:59:16,231
- Hi, Lana.
- Hi, Clark.

1314
01:59:16,399 --> 01:59:20,735
Lana. Lois, say hello to Lana Lang,
Smallville's newest gift to Metropolis.

1315
01:59:20,903 --> 01:59:23,363
I'm glad to meet you.
I like your writing a lot.

1316
01:59:23,739 --> 01:59:24,823
Thank you.

1317
01:59:25,783 --> 01:59:27,117
I like your sparkler a lot.

1318
01:59:27,326 --> 01:59:30,245
Me too. I couldn't believe it
when Clark gave it to me.

1319
01:59:31,747 --> 01:59:33,874
- Clark gave it to you ?
- Yes.

1320
01:59:36,586 --> 01:59:37,961
Mr. White.

1321
01:59:38,171 --> 01:59:41,298
Mr. White, look what I've got for you.

1322
01:59:41,507 --> 01:59:44,426
People, I am in love with this machine !

1323
01:59:44,594 --> 01:59:49,222
Mr. White, excuse me, but I have
a couple of errands to run before lunch.

1324
01:59:49,432 --> 01:59:52,142
- Go ahead, Mr. White.
- Where's the handle ?

1325
01:59:52,351 --> 01:59:55,604
There is no handle.
You just push the button.
