“我立下大地的根基时”
[ Waves Lapping, Faint ]

00:00:47,956 --> 00:00:49,947

是他们领我走进你的门
It was they who Ied me to your door.

10
00:02:04,066 --> 00:02:07,593
修女教我们人生有两条道路
[ Woman ] The nuns taught us there are two ways through Iife-

11
00:02:09,104 --> 00:02:11,004
自然之路
the way of nature...

12
00:02:11,907 --> 00:02:13,670
和上帝之路
and the way of grace.

13
00:02:15,377 --> 00:02:18,005
你要选择自己想走哪一条
You have to choose which one you'II foIIow.

14
00:02:30,125 --> 00:02:33,492
选择上帝之路是不会自私的
Grace doesn't try to pIease itseIf.

15
00:02:35,464 --> 00:02:40,834
被轻蔑、漠视或厌恶都愿承受
Accepts being sIighted, forgotten, disIiked.

16
00:02:44,106 --> 00:02:47,075
也愿承受羞辱和伤害
Accepts insuIts and injuries.

17
00:03:05,527 --> 00:03:07,995
自然之路是自私的
Nature onIy wants to pIease itseIf.

18
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:10,432
感谢天父赐给我们食物
- BIess, O Lord, this food to our use-

19
00:03:10,432 --> 00:03:12,662
还要别人也嘉惠自己
- Get others to pIease it too.

20
00:03:12,935 --> 00:03:14,664
恭敬和忠诚地侍奉您
[ Father ] ...your Ioving and faithfuI service.

21
00:03:14,703 --> 00:03:16,534
对别人颐指气使
Likes to Iord it over them.

22
00:03:16,605 --> 00:03:18,664
保佑这几个孩子

23
00:03:18,941 --> 00:03:20,841
为所欲为
[ Woman ] To have its own way.

24
00:03:25,614 --> 00:03:27,980
难怪选择自然之路会不快乐
It finds reasons to be unhappy...

25
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:31,677
周遭的其他人却满脸笑容
when aII the worId is shining around it...

26
00:03:32,621 --> 00:03:35,988
而爱透过万物在微笑
when Iove is smiIing through aII things.

27
00:03:50,739 --> 00:03:53,902
修女教我们选择上帝之路的人
They taught us that no one who Ioves the way of grace...

28
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:57,204
都不会有不好的下场
ever comes to a bad end.

29
00:04:04,886 --> 00:04:06,945
我会忠于你
[ Woman ] I wiII be true to you.

30
00:04:09,024 --> 00:04:11,720
无论发生什么事
Whatever comes.

31
00:06:32,167 --> 00:06:33,725
我的儿子
- [ ChiId Chattering, Faint ] - [ Mother Whispers ] My son.

我好想死
[ Quiet Sob ] I just want to die...

33
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,775
我想去陪他
to be with him.

34
00:07:27,088 --> 00:07:29,716
他回归主的怀抱了
[ OIder Man ] He's in God's hands now.

35
00:07:35,964 --> 00:07:38,933
他一直都在主的怀抱中
[ Mother ] He was in God's hands the whoIe time.

36
00:07:41,436 --> 00:07:42,960

38

我的上帝
My God.

39
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:04,722
我不惧怕邪恶
''I shaII fear no eviI-

40
00:08:05,994 --> 00:08:08,724
不惧怕邪恶，因有你陪伴
fear no eviI, for you are with me. ''

41
00:08:08,964 --> 00:08:10,727
你得到了什么？
What did you gain?

42
00:08:10,799 --> 00:08:13,359
切莫离我远去，因灾难将临
''Be not far from me, for troubIe is near. ''

43
00:08:13,435 --> 00:08:15,403
好了，回去吧，我们没事
[ Father ] Okay, go on now. We're aII right.

44
00:08:18,273 --> 00:08:19,968
我们没事的
We're aII right.

45
00:08:29,251 --> 00:08:30,843
谢谢你
Thank you. Thank you.

46
00:08:36,324 --> 00:08:38,986
你可以回忆他
- Sure, you have your memories of him, and, uh- - [ Mother Crying QuietIy ]

47
00:08:40,328 --> 00:08:42,819
你现在要坚强
you're gonna have to be strong now and-

48
00:08:45,834 --> 00:08:50,705
我知道假以时日，痛苦会过去
I know the pain wiII- It wiII pass in time, you know?

49
00:08:50,705 --> 00:08:54,999
我这样讲也许残忍，但这是事实
It might seem... hard, my saying that... but it's true.

50
00:08:55,010 --> 00:08:57,274
我不要痛苦过去
[ Whispers ] I don't want it to.

51
00:08:59,781 --> 00:09:01,476
人生总要继续
Life goes on.

52
00:09:03,418 --> 00:09:05,409
每个人都会死
PeopIe pass aIong.

53
00:09:07,188 --> 00:09:09,486
变化是难免的
Nothing stays the same.

54
00:09:12,861 --> 00:09:14,920
你还有两个儿子
You've stiII got the other two.

55
00:09:21,803 --> 00:09:26,131
上帝是有施有取的
- [ Quiet Sob ] - The Lord gives, and the Lord takes away... and...

56
00:09:26,308 --> 00:09:28,902
这是天经地义的
that's the way he is.

57
00:09:34,249 --> 00:09:39,983
派苍蝇围绕在k应治愈的伤口上
He sends fIies to wounds... that he shouId heaI.

58
00:09:55,904 --> 00:09:59,101
我从来没跟他说我有多抱歉
[ Father ] I never got a chance to teII him how sorry I was.

59
00:10:05,347 --> 00:10:07,247
有一天晚上他…
One night he...

60
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:13,482
莫名其妙地打了自己的脸
punched him- himseIf in the face for no reason.

61
00:10:20,395 --> 00:10:22,090
他和我一起坐在钢琴前面
He was sitting next to me at the piano...

62
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:25,132
我批评他翻页的方式
and I criticized the way he turned the pages.

63
00:10:43,118 --> 00:10:45,313
我让他觉得羞耻
I made him feeI shame.

64
00:10:47,122 --> 00:10:48,453
其实是我羞耻
My shame.

65
00:10:54,295 --> 00:10:55,990
可怜的孩子
[ Whispers ] That poor boy.

66
00:10:56,398 --> 00:10:58,559
可怜的孩子
That poor boy.

67
00:11:28,063 --> 00:11:30,395
您是怎么来到我面前的？
[ Man ] How did you come to me?

68
00:11:37,238 --> 00:11:39,172
以怎样的样貌？
In what shape?

69
00:11:43,645 --> 00:11:45,636
怎样的伪装？
What disguise?

70
00:13:09,364 --> 00:13:11,662
我看到儿时的我
I see the chiId that I was.

71
00:13:20,708 --> 00:13:22,608
我看到我弟弟
- I see my brother. - [ Water Running ]

72
00:13:26,614 --> 00:13:28,138
真诚
True.

73
00:13:31,085 --> 00:13:32,450
和善
kind.

74

他在19岁那年死了
He died when he was 1 9.

75
00:14:14,262 --> 00:14:17,322
比对这两份检查一下
Just check this- this one against this.

76
00:14:17,432 --> 00:14:19,093
她想要复合
She wants to get back together, but... that chapter's cIosed...

只是覆水已经难收了

78
00:14:24,839 --> 00:14:26,568
你打算怎么做？

实验
Experiment.

80

重点是你的事业
When you're young, it's aII about your career.

81
00:14:36,784 --> 00:14:39,150
你什么也不懂
You don't understand anything.

82
00:14:46,694 --> 00:14:50,357
我觉得我像是遇到瓶颈了
I just feeI Iike I'm bumping into waIIs.

83
00:15:03,378 --> 00:15:05,243
什么事都不对了
I didn't know how to do her hair.

84
00:15:07,582 --> 00:15:11,780
人很贪心，愈来愈糟糕


85
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:18,281
他们想支配你


86
00:15:18,326 --> 00:15:20,590
…又回到那座沼泽


87
00:15:26,567 --> 00:15:30,628
父亲，抱歉我讲了那种话
Hey, Dad. I'm sorry I said what I said. I-

88
00:15:37,211 --> 00:15:39,577
对，我每天都会想他
Yeah. Yeah, I think about him every day.

89
00:15:39,614 --> 00:15:42,310
我不应该讲那种话，对不起
I just shouIdn't have said what I did, and I'm sorry.

90
00:15:47,188 --> 00:15:49,884
没事啦，只是今天很累
No, it's just, oh, this day.

91
00:15:51,826 --> 00:15:52,815
你在想什么？
[ Father ] What are you thinkin'?

92

我知道你尽力了

94
00:16:20,855 --> 00:16:23,289

95
00:16:30,298 --> 00:16:31,959

101
00:19:44,492 --> 00:19:46,084

你早就知道吗？
[ Mother Whispering ] Did you know?

105
00:21:24,425 --> 00:21:27,053

信靠你之前

等这棵树长高你就长大了
You'II be grown before that tree is taII.

144
00:45:10,016 --> 00:45:11,916
蓝、远
[ Son As ChiId ] BIue. Far.

145
00:45:14,787 --> 00:45:16,049
你
You.

146
00:45:29,135 --> 00:45:30,796
你害怕吗？
Are you afraid?

147
00:45:32,905 --> 00:45:34,031
过来
Come here.

过来这里，别过去
Now, come back here, Son. Stay out of there.

150
00:46:30,496 --> 00:46:32,157
那是隔壁邻居的院子
That's the Spencers' yard. Okay?

151
00:46:32,799 --> 00:46:34,460
有没有看到这条线？
You see this Iine? 

152
00:46:34,700 --> 00:46:36,691
不能跨过去，听见没？
Let's not cross it. Do you understand?

153
00:46:37,970 --> 00:46:39,198
听见没？
Hmm? Do you understand?

154
00:46:40,106 --> 00:46:42,472
有没有看到这条线？你看
You see this Iine? Lookit here. Look here.

155
00:46:44,710 --> 00:46:46,007
儿子，回来
Okay. Now, come back here, Son.

156
00:46:46,045 --> 00:46:47,478
给我回来
Come on back.

157
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:55,982
不准过去
Stay out of there.

158
00:47:12,638 --> 00:47:15,903
有天早上兔妈妈跟小兔子们说…
'''Now, my dears,' said oId Mrs. Rabbit one morning...

159
00:47:16,576 --> 00:47:18,908
你们可以去田里或路边玩
'you may go into the fieIds or down the Iane...

160
00:47:19,979 --> 00:47:23,005
但千万别进麦先生的花园
but don't go into Mr. McGregor's garden..

161
00:47:23,516 --> 00:47:25,916
爸爸在那儿发生过意外
Father had an accident there. '''

162
00:47:32,225 --> 00:47:34,216
上帝就住在那里
That's where God Iives.

163
00:48:01,687 --> 00:48:06,181
晚安，我们五年后再见
Good night. We'II see ya in five years.

164
00:49:02,114 --> 00:49:03,945
你想吃蚱蜢吗？
You want to eat a grasshopper?

165
00:49:04,884 --> 00:49:07,079
我找到一块恐龙骨头
I found a dinosaur bone!

166
00:49:07,786 --> 00:49:10,946
-那是石头吗？    -不是
Oh! - Is that a rock? - No.

167
00:49:36,315 --> 00:49:37,942
儿子们！
Boys!

168
00:49:38,951 --> 00:49:40,111
回家了！
Come home!

169
00:49:44,357 --> 00:49:45,824

00:49:54,233 --> 00:49:55,894
回家了！
Come home!

171
00:50:03,976 --> 00:50:05,341
嘎嘎呜啦啦！


172
00:50:08,814 --> 00:50:10,338
换你当鬼！
You're a ''potIeak'' now!

173
00:50:16,756 --> 00:50:17,984
脏死了！
- You're fiIthy!

174
00:50:19,091 --> 00:50:20,718
感谢天父赐给我们食物
BIess this food to our use

175
00:50:20,793 --> 00:50:23,694
使我们恭敬和忠诚地侍奉您
and us to your Ioving and faithfuI service...

176
00:50:24,030 --> 00:50:27,193
也使我们去照顾有需要的人
and make us ever mindfuI of those who are in need.

177
00:50:27,733 --> 00:50:28,700
阿们
Amen.

178
00:50:36,375 --> 00:50:38,206
请把奶油递给我
Can you pass the butter, pIease?

179
00:50:39,445 --> 00:50:41,345
“先生”请把奶油递给我
- ''Can you pass the butter, pIease, sir?''

180
00:50:41,714 --> 00:50:43,011
先生
- Sir.

181
00:50:44,116 --> 00:50:45,981
你今天做了什么？
What'd you do today?

182
00:50:46,852 --> 00:50:48,114
去上学
- Went to schooI.

183
00:50:48,187 --> 00:50:49,711
然后呢？
- After that?

184
00:50:50,756 --> 00:50:52,155
院子有没有整理？
What about the yard?

185
00:50:52,792 --> 00:50:55,124
有没有照我讲的修剪枝叶？
Did you put the runners in Iike I asked?

186
00:50:56,362 --> 00:50:57,852
有
Yeah.

187
00:50:58,264 --> 00:50:59,356
有的，先生
Yes, sir.

188
00:51:01,167 --> 00:51:02,828
看不出来
[ Father ] WeII, it didn't Iook Iike it.

189
00:51:19,885 --> 00:51:21,147
对
- Hmm? - Yes.

190
00:51:34,266 --> 00:51:36,268
老师说杰克的心得报告写得很好
Mr. Reese Iiked Jack's book report-

191
00:51:36,268 --> 00:51:38,759
那是什么？    -要他上台报告
- [ Father ] What is that, sweetheart? - and wanted him to make a modeI.

192
00:51:39,472 --> 00:51:41,337
你知道这个吗？
You know this?

193
00:51:51,183 --> 00:51:52,241
布拉姆斯
Brahms.

194
00:51:52,284 --> 00:51:53,251
“布拉姆斯，第四交响曲”


195
00:51:53,285 --> 00:51:54,252
“托斯卡尼尼”


196
00:52:05,197 --> 00:52:06,095
儿子
Son?

197
00:52:07,032 --> 00:52:08,260
什么事？
Sir?

198
00:52:09,368 --> 00:52:11,131
打火机给我
Reach me my Iighter.

199
00:52:19,278 --> 00:52:21,212
你是不是忘了什么？
Haven't you forgotten somethin'?

200
00:52:46,105 --> 00:52:48,232
你爱你父亲吗？
Do you Iove your father?

201
00:52:49,308 --> 00:52:50,536
是的，先生
Yes, sir.

202
00:52:53,245 --> 00:52:59,144
他们跑去找岩蟒卡卡
[ Mother ] ''...against the Panther... and they went off to Iook for Kaa the Rock Python.

203
00:53:01,921 --> 00:53:05,948
它在午后温暖的岩棚上晒太阳
They found him stretched out on a warm Iedge in the afternoon sun...

204
00:53:06,525 --> 00:53:10,427
享受它刚蜕换的美丽新皮
admiring his beautifuI new coat.''

205
00:53:18,938 --> 00:53:20,565
你最爱谁？
Who do you Iove the most?

206
00:53:26,579 --> 00:53:28,911
你们三个我都一样爱
I Iove you aII three the same.

207
00:53:30,349 --> 00:53:33,512
讲个我们出生前的故事
TeII us a story from before we can remember.

208
00:53:37,423 --> 00:53:39,891
有一次去坐飞机
[ Mother ] Went for a ride in a pIane once.

209
00:53:43,128 --> 00:53:45,358
那是毕业礼物
It was a graduation present.

210
00:54:00,913 --> 00:54:02,210
母亲
[ Young Jack Whispers ] Mother.

211
00:54:11,223 --> 00:54:12,622
教我听话
Make me good.

212
00:54:20,566 --> 00:54:22,090
勇敢
Brave.

213
00:57:21,547 --> 00:57:23,777
谁都可能变这样吗？
[ Youngest Brother ] Can it happen to anyone?

214
00:57:30,589 --> 00:57:32,716
没人会提这种事
[ Young Jack ] Nobody taIks about it.

215
00:57:37,296 --> 00:57:39,696
教我别跟爸爸顶嘴
HeIp me not to sass my dad.

216
00:57:41,633 --> 00:57:44,727
教我别惹狗狗打架
HeIp me not to get dogs in fights.

217
00:57:58,750 --> 00:58:01,810
教我感恩我所拥有的一切
HeIp me be thankfuI for everything I've got.

218
00:58:03,822 --> 00:58:05,619
你住在哪里？
[ Young Jack ] Where do you Iive?

219
00:58:07,559 --> 00:58:09,550
教我别撒谎
HeIp me not to teII Iies.

220
00:58:16,535 --> 00:58:18,435
你在看顾我吗？
[ Whispering ] Are you watching me?

221
00:58:29,114 --> 00:58:30,843
我想了解你
I want to know what you are.

222
00:58:37,656 --> 00:58:40,181
我想看见你所看见的
I want to see what you see.

223
00:59:33,178 --> 00:59:34,509
儿子们，过来！
- [ Father ] Come here, youI - [ Boys Shouting ]

224
00:59:36,415 --> 00:59:37,746
过来！
- Come here. Come here, you! - [ Laughing ]

225
00:59:48,427 --> 00:59:51,828
你站在那儿静静地关门，50次
You're gonna stand there, and you're gonna cIose this door quietIy 50 times.

226
00:59:53,498 --> 00:59:55,227
数出来
Count it out.

227
00:59:56,268 --> 00:59:58,828
三、四
Three, four...

228
00:59:59,371 --> 01:00:04,743
五、六、七…
five, six... seven, eight-

229
01:00:04,743 --> 01:00:08,679
不能只拔上面，要连根拔除
You can't just yank off the top. You gotta get it by the root.

230
01:00:16,755 --> 01:00:18,245
你妈太天真了
- [ Father ] Your mother's naive. - Whoa!

231
01:00:18,323 --> 01:00:21,224
在这个世界要硬起来才能出头天
It takes fierce wiII to get ahead in this worId.

232
01:00:22,894 --> 01:00:25,385
人善就会被人欺
If you're good, peopIe take advantage of you.

233
01:00:31,803 --> 01:00:34,931
那些高阶主管是怎么爬上来的？
Every one of these top executives- you know how they got where they are?

234
01:00:35,507 --> 01:00:37,702
他们随波逐流
- FIoated right down the middIe of the river. - [ Laughing ]

235
01:00:40,278 --> 01:00:43,509
不让别人说你有什么事做不到
Don't Iet anyone teII you there's anything you can't do.

236
01:00:45,651 --> 01:00:48,984
别像我这样，答应我
Don't do Iike I did. Promise me that.

237
01:00:50,789 --> 01:00:52,654
我梦想要当伟大的音乐家
I dreamed of being a great musician.

238
01:00:53,659 --> 01:00:55,889
结果我走偏了
I Iet myseIf get sidetracked.

239
01:00:57,262 --> 01:00:59,696
想做什么就要贯彻到底
If you're Iookin' for somethin' to happen, that was it.

240
01:01:00,265 --> 01:01:02,699
这是人生，你要好好地活
That was Iife. You Iived it.

241
01:01:18,550 --> 01:01:21,986
约伯想学小鸟在高处筑巢
[ Man ] Job imagined he might buiId his nest on high...

242
01:01:22,754 --> 01:01:27,350
他以为言行正直就能免除不幸
that the integrity of his behavior wouId protect him against misfortune.

243
01:01:27,693 --> 01:01:32,458
朋友们都误以为上帝会处罚他
And his friends thought, mistakenIy... that the Lord couId onIy have punished him...

244
01:01:32,531 --> 01:01:35,523
因为他私自做了错的事
because secretIy he'd done something wrong.

245
01:01:36,034 --> 01:01:41,396
结果没有，好人也会遭遇不幸
But no. Misfortune befaIIs the good as weII.

246
01:01:41,473 --> 01:01:43,634
我们是避免不了的
We can't protect ourseIves against it.

247
01:01:43,942 --> 01:01:45,933
也不能保护我们的小孩
We can't protect our chiIdren.

248
01:01:46,311 --> 01:01:49,047
不能对自己说，就算我不开心
We can't say to ourseIves, ''Even if I'm not happy...

249
01:01:49,047 --> 01:01:51,845
我也要让小孩开心
I'm going to make sure they are.''

250
01:01:52,317 --> 01:01:53,750
我们追着风
We run before the wind.

251
01:01:53,852 --> 01:01:56,548
以为风会永远载着我们跑
We think that it wiII carry us forever.

252
01:01:56,888 --> 01:01:58,355
其实不然
It wiII not.

253
01:01:58,557 --> 01:02:00,422
我们会灰飞烟灭
We vanish as a cIoud.

254
01:02:00,492 --> 01:02:02,653
像秋天的落叶一样枯萎
We wither as the autumn grass...

255
01:02:02,728 --> 01:02:06,027
像树一样被连根拔起
and, Iike a tree, are rooted up.

256
01:02:08,333 --> 01:02:11,496
宇宙的结构中有欺骗吗？
Is there some fraud in the scheme of the universe?

257
01:02:11,570 --> 01:02:13,629
没有什么是不死的吗？
Is there nothing which is deathIess...

258
01:02:13,972 --> 01:02:16,907
没有什么是不会死的吗？
nothing which does not pass away?

259
01:02:18,977 --> 01:02:21,002
我们不可能永远不变
We cannot stay where we are.

260
01:02:21,446 --> 01:02:23,346
我们要往前迈进
We must journey forth.

261
01:02:23,749 --> 01:02:27,344
要超脱命运达到更高远的目标
We must find that which is greater than fortune or fate.

262
01:02:27,419 --> 01:02:32,652
除此之外是不可能平静的
Nothing can bring us peace but that.

263
01:02:33,458 --> 01:02:35,358
是智者的躯体？
Is the body of the wise man or the just...

264
01:02:35,460 --> 01:02:38,728
还是正直之人可免除痛苦？
exempt from any pain...

265
01:02:38,764 --> 01:02:40,459
免除不安？
from any disquietude...

266
01:02:40,832 --> 01:02:43,868
免除可能摧毁美貌的瑕疵？
from the deformity that might bIight its beauty...

267
01:02:43,868 --> 01:02:47,698
免除可能危害健康的弱点？
from the weakness that might destroy its heaIth?

268
01:02:49,007 --> 01:02:50,872
你相信上帝吗？
Do you trust in God?

269
01:02:51,877 --> 01:02:55,005
约伯也忠于上帝
Job, too, was cIose to the Lord.

270
01:02:55,781 --> 01:02:59,615
朋友和小孩是你的安全感来源？
Are your friends and chiIdren your security?

271
01:03:00,385 --> 01:03:04,684
世上无处可躲，或让不幸找不到你
There is no hiding pIace in aII the worId... where troubIe may not find you.

272
01:03:04,689 --> 01:03:07,556
没人知道悲剧几时会来敲门
No one knows when sorrow might visit his house...

273
01:03:07,659 --> 01:03:09,456
约伯也不知道
any more than Job did.

274
01:03:10,862 --> 01:03:13,854
在约伯失去一切的当下
The very moment everything was taken away from Job...

275
01:03:13,932 --> 01:03:17,026
他就知道是上帝取走的
he knew it was the Lord who'd taken it away.

276
01:03:19,471 --> 01:03:22,133
他不再追寻无常的岁月
He turned from the passing shows of time.

277
01:03:22,541 --> 01:03:25,567
试图去捕捉永恒
He sought that which is eternaI.

278
01:03:26,411 --> 01:03:30,472
只有他看到上帝的慷慨施予吗？
Does he aIone see God's hand who sees that he gives?

279
01:03:30,816 --> 01:03:33,751
还是看到上帝施予的人
