1
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:46,620
Where are you when I did the foundation of the earth?

2
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:49,660
When the morning started singing and all

3
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:53,430
God songs were filled with joy?

4
00:01:31,021 --> 00:01:33,581
It was they who led me to your door.

5
00:02:03,891 --> 00:02:06,981
The man has certain ways to get through life.

6
00:02:08,961 --> 00:02:10,551
The way of nature.

7
00:02:11,661 --> 00:02:13,191
And the way of grace.

8
00:02:15,001 --> 00:02:17,701
You have to choose which of the two follow.

9
00:02:30,251 --> 00:02:32,441
Grace does not attempt indulge herself.

10
00:02:35,151 --> 00:02:39,421
Accept that throw a hand, ilvidada rejected.

11
00:02:43,861 --> 00:02:46,761
ACPET insults and injuries.

12
00:03:05,221 --> 00:03:07,781
Nature just trying to please himself.

13
00:03:08,591 --> 00:03:10,561
God bless ...

14
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:12,621
While running out to others.

15
00:03:12,861 --> 00:03:14,351
... To love and respect ...

16
00:03:14,491 --> 00:03:16,461
Treat others with arrogance.

17
00:03:16,661 --> 00:03:18,291
Bless these children.

18
00:03:18,701 --> 00:03:20,491
It has its own ways.

19
00:03:25,271 --> 00:03:27,701
Find reasons to be unhappy ...

20
00:03:27,971 --> 00:03:30,771
... With everyone shining around him.

21
00:03:32,281 --> 00:03:35,181
And love to sonrrie through all things.

22
00:03:50,431 --> 00:03:53,921
We were taught that anyone who love the way of grace ...

23
00:03:54,301 --> 00:03:56,671
... Has a happy ending.

24
00:04:04,641 --> 00:04:06,581
I will be faithful ...

25
00:04:08,851 --> 00:04:10,611
... No matter what happens.

26
00:06:31,861 --> 00:06:33,091
My son.

27
00:06:42,471 --> 00:06:45,331
I want to die. Be with him.

28
00:07:26,851 --> 00:07:29,141
He is now in the hands of God.

29
00:07:35,891 --> 00:07:38,221
All the while he was in God's hands.

30
00:07:41,231 --> 00:07:42,521
Is not it true?

31
00:07:47,171 --> 00:07:48,601
My everything.

32
00:07:54,071 --> 00:07:55,631
My God.

33
00:08:02,211 --> 00:08:04,271
I will fear no evil.

34
00:08:05,781 --> 00:08:08,651
Not listen to bad here because these me.

35
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:10,621
What did you win?

36
00:08:10,821 --> 00:08:13,591
Stay close to me that problems are nearby.

37
00:08:13,761 --> 00:08:15,521
Come on, we're fine.

38
00:08:18,001 --> 00:08:19,491
We're fine.

39
00:08:28,971 --> 00:08:30,571
Thank you.

40
00:08:36,881 --> 00:08:38,751
You must calm your mind.

41
00:08:40,151 --> 00:08:42,211
You have to be strong.

42
00:08:45,521 --> 00:08:49,361
I know the pain will pass with time ...

43
00:08:50,131 --> 00:08:52,191
... May seem ...

44
00:08:52,361 --> 00:08:54,761
... What I'm difficult saying, but true.

45
00:08:54,931 --> 00:08:56,921
I do not want to.

46
00:08:59,341 --> 00:09:01,071
Life goes on.

47
00:09:03,241 --> 00:09:05,111
People spend.

48
00:09:06,951 --> 00:09:08,741
Nothing is the same.

49
00:09:12,551 --> 00:09:14,581
You still have the other two.

50
00:09:21,461 --> 00:09:24,491
The Lord gives and takes.

51
00:09:26,131 --> 00:09:27,661
Here's how it is Him

52
00:09:34,041 --> 00:09:38,371
Send flies to injury He should heal.

53
00:09:55,661 --> 00:09:59,461
We never had the opportunity to tell you how I felt.

54
00:10:04,841 --> 00:10:06,831
I even ...

55
00:10:08,871 --> 00:10:12,641
... Paid him in the face for no reason.

56
00:10:20,291 --> 00:10:24,781
He sat beside me on the piano and I criticized him how to turn the pages.

57
00:10:42,741 --> 00:10:45,231
You may feel shame.

58
00:10:46,511 --> 00:10:48,501
Why shame?

59
00:10:54,291 --> 00:10:57,221
Poor boy.

60
00:11:27,791 --> 00:11:29,881
How did you get me?

61
00:11:36,901 --> 00:11:38,861
In what way?

62
00:11:43,501 --> 00:11:45,261
In what guise?

63
00:13:09,191 --> 00:13:11,451
I see what kind it was.

64
00:13:20,671 --> 00:13:23,101
I see my brother.

65
00:13:26,401 --> 00:13:27,931
True.

66
00:13:30,711 --> 00:13:32,111
Amable.

67
00:13:38,781 --> 00:13:41,451
He died when I was 19 years.

68
00:14:14,191 --> 00:14:17,181
Check this against this.

69
00:14:17,391 --> 00:14:19,381
He wants us back together.

70
00:14:19,861 --> 00:14:21,621
But the story is over.

71
00:14:24,731 --> 00:14:26,061
What will you do?

72
00:14:27,531 --> 00:14:29,021
Experience.

73
00:14:33,171 --> 00:14:35,661
When you're young everything It's your career.

74
00:14:48,491 --> 00:14:50,391
I feel that ...

75
00:15:07,211 --> 00:15:11,441
The world has gone and the dogs are still getting greedy.

76
00:15:13,341 --> 00:15:15,641
Are you going next?

77
00:15:15,851 --> 00:15:18,541
I try to get into their minds.

78
00:15:18,651 --> 00:15:20,581
You have to aconfirmar.

79
00:15:28,791 --> 00:15:30,851
Dad, I regret what I said.

80
00:15:36,901 --> 00:15:40,771
Yes, I think of him every day. Not should have said that. Sorry.

81
00:15:51,751 --> 00:15:53,271
What are you thinking?

82
00:15:56,291 --> 00:15:59,951
I'm just cruel to those customers who refuse.

83
00:16:20,651 --> 00:16:22,771
How did this year?

84
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:31,981
Wonder.

85
00:16:36,231 --> 00:16:38,161
Forgotten.

86
00:17:37,891 --> 00:17:39,381
Find me.

87
00:18:04,421 --> 00:18:06,381
How she endured?

88
00:18:16,091 --> 00:18:17,561
Mother.

89
00:18:55,371 --> 00:18:57,531
Was I wrong with you?

90
00:19:44,281 --> 00:19:46,051
Lord ...

91
00:19:53,321 --> 00:19:54,661
Why?

92
00:20:02,671 --> 00:20:04,571
Where were you?

93
00:21:06,201 --> 00:21:07,861
Did you know?

94
00:21:24,221 --> 00:21:26,481
Who are we to you?

95
00:21:45,901 --> 00:21:47,431
Answer me.

96
00:25:58,961 --> 00:26:01,021
A quick tour for you.

97
00:26:07,361 --> 00:26:08,851
My soul.

98
00:26:18,041 --> 00:26:19,631
My son.

99
00:26:27,991 --> 00:26:29,711
Hear.

100
00:34:34,101 --> 00:34:36,131
Light up my life.

101
00:34:39,611 --> 00:34:41,411
I looked for you.

102
00:34:46,381 --> 00:34:47,511
My everything.

103
00:34:58,501 --> 00:34:59,991
My child.

104
00:36:19,981 --> 00:36:22,171
I talked through it.

105
00:36:26,021 --> 00:36:28,421
You spoke with me from the sky.

106
00:36:30,491 --> 00:36:32,181
Trees.

107
00:36:37,131 --> 00:36:39,121
Before I knew I loved you ...

108
00:36:41,901 --> 00:36:43,591
... Who believed in you.

109
00:37:02,191 --> 00:37:05,121
When you touched my heart first?

110
00:39:39,811 --> 00:39:44,081
That man takes refuge in him of sins, the world y. ..

111
00:40:27,321 --> 00:40:29,691
This really is a fighter.

112
00:42:11,031 --> 00:42:12,821
What is this?

113
00:42:13,031 --> 00:42:15,861
- Two crocodiles. - Two cocdrilos.

114
00:42:21,501 --> 00:42:24,171
- Babysitting. - Babysitting.

115
00:42:28,851 --> 00:42:36,251
Salta.

116
00:43:42,251 --> 00:43:43,411
Honey.

117
00:43:46,161 --> 00:43:47,451
Please.

118
00:43:50,131 --> 00:43:51,291
I know.

119
00:43:51,331 --> 00:43:53,521
No. No!

120
00:44:24,431 --> 00:44:26,161
I found it.

121
00:45:02,201 --> 00:45:05,191
You've already grown before that this tree is high.

122
00:45:10,011 --> 00:45:12,071
My father.

123
00:45:14,581 --> 00:45:15,671
You.

124
00:45:29,131 --> 00:45:30,651
Are you afraid?

125
00:45:32,801 --> 00:45:34,061
Fear not.

126
00:46:27,751 --> 00:46:31,951
Come here. Child back out of there who is spencer yard. Yes?

127
00:46:32,661 --> 00:46:34,211
You see this line?

128
00:46:34,591 --> 00:46:36,521
Crosses not understand?

129
00:46:37,631 --> 00:46:38,991
Do you understand?

130
00:46:40,061 --> 00:46:42,031
Do you see this line? Look here.

131
00:46:44,731 --> 00:46:47,401
Return child return.

132

Mentengamonos away.

133
00:47:12,931 --> 00:47:15,901
''The Mrs., rabbit said one morning, my dear,

134
00:47:16,431 --> 00:47:19,401
You can go to the field and down the path.

135
00:47:19,941 --> 00:47:22,601
Do not meddle in the sr patio. Macgregor.

136
00:47:23,371 --> 00:47:25,531
Follow the camni of God.''

137
00:47:31,381 --> 00:47:33,811
That's where God lives.

138
00:48:01,641 --> 00:48:05,511
You and I'll see you in 5 years.

139
00:49:04,811 --> 00:49:06,401
I found it.

140
00:49:08,841 --> 00:49:10,781
- Release. - No.

141
00:50:18,981 --> 00:50:21,611
Bless this food that we eat ...

142
00:50:21,821 --> 00:50:24,341
... And those who are your faithful servants.

143
00:50:24,521 --> 00:50:27,151
and let all give thanks.

144
00:50:27,521 --> 00:50:28,491
Amen.

145
00:50:36,371 --> 00:50:38,531
Can you pass the butter, please?

146
00:50:39,441 --> 00:50:41,461
Can you pass the butter, please sir?

147
00:50:41,601 --> 00:50:42,801
Lord.

148
00:50:44,041 --> 00:50:47,571
- What did you do today? - We went to school.

149
00:50:48,111 --> 00:50:49,841
After that.

150
00:50:50,611 --> 00:50:52,241
What's with the playground?

151
00:50:52,651 --> 00:50:54,641
They put the fence ¿I told you?

152
00:50:56,291 --> 00:50:57,411
Yes.

153
00:50:58,221 --> 00:50:59,651
Yes, sir.

154
00:51:01,121 --> 00:51:02,681
I thought.

155
00:51:19,581 --> 00:51:20,671
Yes.

156
00:51:34,291 --> 00:51:36,991
Mrs. Reed liked the jack book report.

157
00:51:37,131 --> 00:51:38,791
Wait, dear.

158
00:51:39,761 --> 00:51:41,251
They know this.

159
00:51:51,171 --> 00:51:52,701
What happens?

160
00:52:05,151 --> 00:52:07,251
- Son. - Sir.

161
00:52:09,291 --> 00:52:11,351
Bring me the encededor?

162
00:52:18,901 --> 00:52:21,131
Are not you forgetting something?

163
00:52:46,031 --> 00:52:47,591
Do you love your father?

164
00:52:49,201 --> 00:52:50,431
Yes, sir.

165
00:53:01,841 --> 00:53:05,141
And they were stretched on a reef.

166
00:53:06,551 --> 00:53:08,921
Admiring her beautiful new coat.

167
00:53:18,761 --> 00:53:20,791
Who do you love most?

168
00:53:26,601 --> 00:53:28,701
The masters them all equally.

169
00:53:30,341 --> 00:53:33,711
Tell the story of the we do not remember falling.

170
00:53:37,411 --> 00:53:39,851
Once he went to take a plane ride.

171
00:53:43,051 --> 00:53:44,951
It was a graduation gift.

172
00:54:00,701 --> 00:54:01,761
Mother ...

173
00:54:11,081 --> 00:54:12,511
... Me good.

174
00:54:20,521 --> 00:54:21,891
Valiente.

175
00:57:21,371 --> 00:57:23,201
It can happen to anyone.

176
00:57:30,351 --> 00:57:32,181
Nobody talks about that.

177
00:57:36,991 --> 00:57:39,481
Mom says I'm not dead.

178
00:57:58,611 --> 00:58:01,801
I want to thank all the hoes that I have.

179
00:58:03,681 --> 00:58:05,651
Where do you live?

180
00:58:07,081 --> 00:58:09,571
Help me not to tell lies.

181
00:58:16,331 --> 00:58:18,321
Will I are looking at?

182
00:58:28,801 --> 00:58:30,861
I want to know what you are.

183
00:58:37,451 --> 00:58:39,811
I see the same thing you see.

184
00:59:36,141 --> 00:59:37,471
Come here.

185
00:59:48,451 --> 00:59:52,081
You will stand there and close this silent door 50 times.

186
00:59:53,091 --> 00:59:54,391
Tell them.

187
00:59:56,021 --> 00:59:59,361
3, 4, 5,

188
01:00:00,361 --> 01:00:03,421
6, 7, 8.

189
01:00:04,601 --> 01:00:08,371
Not the lame by leaves but the root.

190
01:00:16,611 --> 01:00:18,101
Your mother is naive.

191
01:00:18,281 --> 01:00:20,611
Thinks that nothing will happen.

192
01:00:22,781 --> 01:00:25,311
That no one can get fresh with you.

193
01:00:31,731 --> 01:00:35,091
I am one of the largest employers You know how they got where they are?

194
01:00:35,301 --> 01:00:37,561
Swimming in the middle of the river.

195
01:00:40,101 --> 01:00:43,271
Do not let anyone tell you you can not do something.

196
01:00:45,411 --> 01:00:48,311
Promise me you'll do as I do.

197
01:00:50,651 --> 01:00:52,811
We train you to be a great musician.

198
01:00:53,481 --> 01:00:55,851
I would never miss.

199
01:00:57,051 --> 01:00:59,541
If you are looking for something to happen to me glad you've lived.

200
01:01:18,341 --> 01:01:21,641
He imagined that it would build his nest on high.

201
01:01:22,681 --> 01:01:27,051
That the integrity of their behavior would protect against bad luck.

202
01:01:27,421 --> 01:01:30,441
and his friends believe comenzarona incorrectly that Mr. ...

203
01:01:30,591 --> 01:01:34,321
... I had punished because he had echo echo something bad secret.

204
01:01:35,991 --> 01:01:37,221
But no.

205
01:01:37,531 --> 01:01:39,551
Bad luck also follows the well.

206
01:01:41,201 --> 01:01:43,531
We can not protect against it.

207
01:01:43,731 --> 01:01:45,721
We can not protect our children.

208
01:01:45,901 --> 01:01:48,771
We can not even say'' if I'm not happy

209
01:01:48,941 --> 01:01:51,801
I will make sure that they are.''

210
01:01:52,041 --> 01:01:55,941
We run before the wind and think we'll carry forever.

211
01:01:56,781 --> 01:01:58,251
And it will not.

212
01:01:58,411 --> 01:02:02,541
Dasvanecemos us like a cloud. Us wither like the grass in autumn.

213
01:02:02,681 --> 01:02:05,281
And as we come to a tree root.

214
01:02:08,021 --> 01:02:11,251
Is there fraud in the scheme of the universe?

215
01:02:11,391 --> 01:02:13,691
Is there something that is not mortal?

216
01:02:13,831 --> 01:02:16,661
There is nothing that will not die.

217
01:02:18,831 --> 01:02:21,201
We can not stay where we are.

218
01:02:21,371 --> 01:02:23,461
Must travel forward.

219
01:02:23,641 --> 01:02:27,371
We find that with the highest fortune or fate.

220
01:02:28,941 --> 01:02:31,851
Nothing can bring us peace in return.

221
01:02:33,281 --> 01:02:37,451
Are you free the body of man wise or just pain?

222
01:02:38,691 --> 01:02:43,281
How unrest, the deformity that can blind your beauty?

223
01:02:43,431 --> 01:02:47,051
What's weakness can destroy your health?

224
01:02:48,861 --> 01:02:53,361
Do you trust God? Joe also was close to the Lord.

225
01:02:55,541 --> 01:02:58,561
Are your children and friends safe?

226
01:03:00,041 --> 01:03:04,171
No hiding place in the world where you will not find the problems.

227
01:03:04,481 --> 01:03:07,641
Nobody knows where the penalty can visit your home.

228
01:03:10,551 --> 01:03:13,111
At the same time everything was taken away

229
01:03:13,261 --> 01:03:16,661
Joe knew that Mr. was the one who took him.

230
01:03:19,231 --> 01:03:22,921
Over the years saw what is eternal.

231
01:03:26,131 --> 01:03:29,301
He only saw the hand of God giving.

232
01:03:30,641 --> 01:03:34,601
But I also saw her remove.

233
01:03:37,181 --> 01:03:41,811
Will he be the only one to see God turn his face toward him?

234
01:03:43,691 --> 01:03:48,521
Or it will also virarle back?

235
01:03:48,691 --> 01:03:50,161
He's a friend of mine.

236
01:03:50,291 --> 01:03:52,021
You'll be in town.

237
01:03:53,501 --> 01:03:55,161
Frank Johnson.

238
01:03:56,201 --> 01:03:58,191
It started as a barber.

239
01:03:59,941 --> 01:04:02,201
He built something big.

240
01:04:03,971 --> 01:04:06,911
And now it seems the most boring Paerson.

241
01:04:09,241 --> 01:04:11,241
They never talk about money.

242
01:04:14,781 --> 01:04:16,841
Of those who go hungry.

243
01:04:18,191 --> 01:04:19,781
Of those who die.

244
01:04:21,991 --> 01:04:23,791
Of those who love them.

245
01:04:26,831 --> 01:04:28,891
The world lives in a trigger.

246
01:04:31,631 --> 01:04:34,431
If you do not succeed can be very good.

247
01:04:42,141 --> 01:04:44,981
Hey girl do you want corn bread?

248
01:04:46,181 --> 01:04:48,241
Do you want butter?

249
01:04:50,251 --> 01:04:52,191
Give me a pound of bread.

250
01:05:20,751 --> 01:05:22,841
This will like.

251
01:05:23,081 --> 01:05:25,851
Act like you're scared, as if you do not want problems.

252
01:05:25,991 --> 01:05:28,011
And the moment that see blink. You just.

253
01:05:28,161 --> 01:05:29,381
Yes?

254
01:05:29,561 --> 01:05:32,391
Put your hands on the 3 and 15. If you cover?

255
01:05:32,561 --> 01:05:36,961
Paste. Come on. Good. Harder. Good. It show me a good right-left.

256
01:05:37,601 --> 01:05:42,161
If you come here you to take care. Come on, hit me.

257
01:05:43,101 --> 01:05:45,401
Come on, hit me jack.

258
01:05:45,541 --> 01:05:47,271
Hit me, come on.

259
01:05:47,411 --> 01:05:49,271
Here it is, hit me.

260
01:05:49,411 --> 01:05:50,741
Come on, son.

261
01:05:50,911 --> 01:05:53,071
Left cares what you do?

262
01:05:56,621 --> 01:05:58,851
Get dirty.

263
01:06:00,021 --> 01:06:03,011
Left. Do not remove tongue or lose.

264
01:06:03,161 --> 01:06:06,651
Left. Right.

265
01:06:07,531 --> 01:06:09,091
Left harder.

266
01:06:09,261 --> 01:06:11,821
Harder. Let glue.

267
01:06:12,431 --> 01:06:14,991
Hit me, let son, paste.

268
01:06:15,141 --> 01:06:17,601
Give me something, show me you have.

269
01:06:19,171 --> 01:06:21,041
Come, go.

270
01:06:27,481 --> 01:06:28,851
A meal.

271
01:06:44,371 --> 01:06:46,061
Go to the table.

272
01:06:52,271 --> 01:06:53,741
Do you?

273
01:06:55,681 --> 01:06:57,771
- Will you still laughing? - No, sir.

274
01:06:57,951 --> 01:07:00,641
Do not interrupt me, I have not finished.

275
01:07:03,691 --> 01:07:03,821
Does it end?

276
01:07:03,821 --> 01:07:05,291
You're not going to end?

277
01:07:06,551 --> 01:07:09,861
- No? - Yes

278
01:07:09,861 --> 01:07:11,951
Thank you, your majesty.

279
01:08:08,481 --> 01:08:10,181
Invent stories.

280
01:08:13,661 --> 01:08:15,711
Many words.

281
01:08:24,031 --> 01:08:27,091
He says do not put your elbows on the table.

282
01:08:28,471 --> 01:08:29,961
He does

283
01:08:33,911 --> 01:08:36,171
insulting people.

284
01:08:37,651 --> 01:08:39,241
No one cares.

285
01:08:39,681 --> 01:08:41,111
I remember when you were born.

286
01:08:46,751 --> 01:08:48,241
I was not allowed to come home.

287
01:08:50,261 --> 01:08:55,131
They said the officer must be present at his post but ...

288
01:08:56,361 --> 01:08:58,031
I had enough.

289
01:09:42,081 --> 01:09:43,871
The next word is volcano.

290
01:09:54,621 --> 01:09:56,721
Next is football.

291
01:10:03,031 --> 01:10:06,731
Please pass around the answers. Now will evaluate the responses of others.

292
01:10:13,041 --> 01:10:14,671
No interruptions, please.

293
01:10:16,481 --> 01:10:19,881
Come on, use your pencil.

294
01:11:41,261 --> 01:11:43,061
What is it, Edward, dear?

295
01:11:43,431 --> 01:11:44,861
Honey!

296
01:13:14,291 --> 01:13:15,881
Was it bad?

297
01:13:25,431 --> 01:13:28,061
Do you also die?

298
01:13:30,441 --> 01:13:32,501
Still not so old, Mom.

299
01:13:50,861 --> 01:13:52,551
Where were you?

300
01:14:04,841 --> 01:14:06,531
I avoid it.

301
01:14:14,151 --> 01:14:16,241
What if something happens?

302
01:14:29,301 --> 01:14:32,131
- I can not see! - I can not see!

303
01:14:37,041 --> 01:14:39,271
Why should I be good?

304
01:14:42,441 --> 01:14:44,311
If you are ...

305
01:15:33,931 --> 01:15:35,421
Thank you.

306
01:15:50,541 --> 01:15:52,941
We're close.

307
01:15:55,121 --> 01:15:56,881
Why not bury him here?

308
01:15:57,721 --> 01:15:59,651
The grass does not grow under the tree.

309
01:16:00,091 --> 01:16:02,611
- In Kimble house itself. - They have a gardener.

310
01:16:02,961 --> 01:16:04,451
They have money.

311
01:16:04,831 --> 01:16:06,821
Of course I inherited.

312
01:16:08,361 --> 01:16:12,731
One more word and you will not continue.

313
01:16:52,641 --> 01:16:54,371
You're doing too close.

314
01:16:54,781 --> 01:16:56,941
You have to keep it with water.

315
01:17:23,741 --> 01:17:25,041
Toskinini.

316
01:17:25,741 --> 01:17:29,071
Once a piece recorded 66 times. You know what he said when completed?

317
01:17:30,141 --> 01:17:32,041
Could be better''. ''

318
01:17:34,121 --> 01:17:35,551
Think about it.

319
01:17:37,921 --> 01:17:41,011
Your father has 27 patterns.

320
01:17:42,391 --> 01:17:44,981
It is the master of his ideas.

321
01:17:46,531 --> 01:17:50,431
You have to afincarte and take the bull by the horns.

322
01:17:52,501 --> 01:17:54,091
Be rich.

323
01:17:56,541 --> 01:17:58,771
Forjas what you are.

324
01:18:02,711 --> 01:18:04,441
You control your own destiny.

325
01:18:08,281 --> 01:18:09,941
You can not say I can not.

326
01:18:11,521 --> 01:18:13,421
You say: I am having problems.

327
01:18:14,791 --> 01:18:19,351
I have not finished yet. Not you say I can not.

328
01:18:54,701 --> 01:18:56,691
Why is it ...

329
01:18:59,001 --> 01:19:01,061
our father?

330
01:19:07,071 --> 01:19:09,601
C'mon. Oh, yes.

331
01:19:24,661 --> 01:19:26,561
Kiss your father.

332
01:20:06,301 --> 01:20:09,241
Why?

333
01:20:11,211 --> 01:20:12,901
- I can not. - You do something for me?

334
01:20:13,341 --> 01:20:14,401
Do you promise that you will do?

335
01:20:14,741 --> 01:20:18,181
I have not asked yet, but have confidence in that what your father asks is the right thing.

336
01:20:18,511 --> 01:20:19,911
Yes.

337
01:20:20,451 --> 01:20:24,141
In the next half hour, not to speak unless you have something important to say.

338
01:20:30,821 --> 01:20:32,791
What did you do today, my dear friend?

339
01:20:35,261 --> 01:20:36,991
The chair closer.

340
01:20:37,571 --> 01:20:40,731
It's better for your posture. I read in the newspaper.

341
01:20:44,611 --> 01:20:46,971
Do you really bought it Mr. Lamfeather this?

342
01:20:48,081 --> 01:20:50,311
Answer me. Yes or no.

343
01:20:56,521 --> 01:20:58,541
Silence.

344
01:21:00,051 --> 01:21:01,921
What?

345
01:21:05,191 --> 01:21:06,451
Please.

346
01:21:07,131 --> 01:21:08,191
Leave him alone.

347
01:21:12,071 --> 01:21:13,431
Leave him alone!

348
01:21:17,871 --> 01:21:19,741
Come here! Come here!

349
01:21:24,581 --> 01:21:25,981
Up there.

350
01:22:22,741 --> 01:22:24,531
You're going back to my children against me.

351
01:22:26,211 --> 01:22:28,231
Socabas everything I do.

352
01:22:37,821 --> 01:22:39,581
What do you think?

353
01:22:41,421 --> 01:22:42,551
Stop!

354
01:22:43,591 --> 01:22:50,021
Stop.

355
01:23:01,141 --> 01:23:02,511
Stop.

356
01:25:00,761 --> 01:25:04,161
- Where's Dad? - He went away.

357
01:25:47,211 --> 01:25:49,771
Catch him! Catch him!

358
01:25:49,941 --> 01:25:51,841
Help yourself.

359
01:25:54,111 --> 01:25:56,741
No, it will not know that!

360
01:25:57,821 --> 01:25:59,751
Love all.

361
01:26:02,561 --> 01:26:04,111
Each morning,

362
01:26:05,891 --> 01:26:08,051
every ray of light.

363
01:26:15,801 --> 01:26:18,401
They are our gift.

364
01:26:57,681 --> 01:26:58,911
Shut up!

365
01:27:56,541 --> 01:27:58,731
Beware! Beware! Run!

366
01:28:17,861 --> 01:28:19,381
I say that we break.

367
01:28:32,571 --> 01:28:33,601
Yes!

368
01:28:43,721 --> 01:28:45,081
Yes!

369
01:28:45,891 --> 01:28:48,011
Catch the frog.

370
01:28:48,721 --> 01:28:50,191
Lets build a rocket.

371
01:28:50,561 --> 01:28:52,021
Come on!

372
01:28:54,391 --> 01:28:55,881
Back, back!

373
01:29:03,171 --> 01:29:04,871
Will the moon?

374
01:29:07,971 --> 01:29:12,541
- Where is it? - There you are.

375
01:29:13,811 --> 01:29:15,581
It was an experiment!

376
01:29:19,591 --> 01:29:20,811
Why?

377
01:29:22,761 --> 01:29:24,781
Do not ever do more.

378
01:29:25,591 --> 01:29:27,321
Promise?

379
01:29:30,331 --> 01:29:32,361
Did not I tell Dad?

380
01:29:33,501 --> 01:29:36,831
Trying to scare you.

381
01:29:38,841 --> 01:29:40,531
Keep your ear there.

382
01:29:45,111 --> 01:29:47,011
The things to be learned.

383
01:29:50,521 --> 01:29:53,541
I learn things to grow.

384
01:30:10,601 --> 01:30:14,511
They say you can not throwing things. They did.

385
01:30:19,081 --> 01:30:21,071
What are you afraid of?

386
01:30:24,281 --> 01:30:27,911
You're afraid. I see it.

387
01:30:28,691 --> 01:30:30,711
Over here! Over here!

388
01:35:56,181 --> 01:35:57,981
I do not want to talk to you.

389
01:36:07,191 --> 01:36:08,891
Do not look at me.

390
01:36:57,381 --> 01:36:59,471
More stories.

391
01:37:03,421 --> 01:37:06,871
Until dawn.

392
01:37:35,381 --> 01:37:36,811
Put it there.

393
01:38:16,261 --> 01:38:17,851
I trust you.

394
01:38:34,071 --> 01:38:37,511
- Guitar! - No. The guitar does not.

395
01:38:38,511 --> 01:38:41,311
- You did this morning. - No, just pretending.

396
01:38:41,881 --> 01:38:43,781
- You're telling me a liar? - No.

397
01:38:44,281 --> 01:38:47,981
- Do not want to fight. - Are you scared?

398
01:38:48,551 --> 01:38:50,391
No, just do not want.

399
01:38:51,821 --> 01:38:55,321
If I scare you do not call me a liar.

400
01:38:57,131 --> 01:39:00,161
You really want is not it?

401
01:39:10,441 --> 01:39:11,881
Go ahead.

402
01:40:00,131 --> 01:40:01,461
Come here!

403
01:40:09,001 --> 01:40:10,941
I do not want to do what I say.

404
01:40:12,341 --> 01:40:14,501
I do what I want.

405
01:40:18,641 --> 01:40:21,171
What do you know? You Dad over you all the time.

406
01:41:11,801 --> 01:41:13,931
How do I return

407
01:41:19,411 --> 01:41:21,271
where are they?

408
01:41:55,881 --> 01:41:57,931
Give me a hand with this.

409
01:42:08,321 --> 01:42:11,311
- OK, you know what that is? - Chinese.

410
01:42:12,061 --> 01:42:14,051
Yes, Chinese, well, it is.

411
01:42:15,461 --> 01:42:18,401
Your father traveled all the world to China.

412
01:42:19,231 --> 01:42:22,531
This is Maryland. There is where his father flew.

413
01:42:22,971 --> 01:42:26,411
All the steel bath steel. To the sink.

414
01:42:26,771 --> 01:42:29,001
I have confidence in to close the deal.

415
01:42:29,511 --> 01:42:31,271
I did not forget anything.

416
01:42:32,111 --> 01:42:34,711
- This is from Germany. - How nice!

417
01:42:35,011 --> 01:42:36,171
See?

418
01:42:39,451 --> 01:42:41,181
Put it down, son.

419
01:42:41,591 --> 01:42:42,851
Tyler ¿can you go?

420
01:42:43,521 --> 01:42:45,291
Your family is not good enough for you?

421
01:42:52,671 --> 01:42:55,571
Not be delayed as much as last time.

422
01:42:56,041 --> 01:42:57,701
Al dente.

423
01:43:00,771 --> 01:43:03,501
If it is not subjective makes no difference.

424
01:43:03,811 --> 01:43:06,641
Subjective means coming from the mind and can not be proven by the people.

425
01:43:14,991 --> 01:43:17,961
It's good to see you. Come on, guys.

426
01:43:22,231 --> 01:43:23,891
There are things you can not do.

427
01:43:24,231 --> 01:43:26,221
There are things I can not do.

428
01:43:27,631 --> 01:43:30,001
Do not call me, Dad. Call me father.

429
01:43:30,341 --> 01:43:31,601
- But ... - Do not interrupt!

430
01:43:31,971 --> 01:43:33,801
- But you ... - Do not interrupt!

431
01:43:39,551 --> 01:43:40,771
It's your house.

432
01:43:41,151 --> 01:43:43,551
May be expelled at any time.

433
01:43:48,691 --> 01:43:51,251
You can even kill me.

434
01:44:10,241 --> 01:44:11,571
Dad.

435
01:44:16,521 --> 01:44:19,111
I want to sleep.

436
01:45:43,901 --> 01:45:45,531
Please God, kill him.

437
01:45:50,681 --> 01:45:52,081
Let it die.

438
01:45:57,251 --> 01:45:59,181
Him out of here.

439
01:46:20,141 --> 01:46:22,871
She just loves me!

440
01:46:41,561 --> 01:46:44,461
... And the daily increase in the holy spirit y. ..

441
01:47:32,111 --> 01:47:34,171
I saw something.

442
01:48:24,701 --> 01:48:26,131
Put your finger there.

443
01:48:28,471 --> 01:48:29,761
Look at this.

444
01:48:31,271 --> 01:48:32,901
Come on.

445
01:49:30,801 --> 01:49:33,321
I can not do what I do.

446
01:49:38,901 --> 01:49:41,401
Yes I do.

447
01:50:42,331 --> 01:50:43,891
You can hit me if you want.

448
01:51:02,151 --> 01:51:03,351
Sorry.

449
01:51:06,691 --> 01:51:08,721
You're my brother.

450
01:51:52,911 --> 01:51:55,141
How was it? Show me.

451
01:52:03,621 --> 01:52:06,881
I did not know how to name it.

452
01:52:11,491 --> 01:52:14,391
But I tell you.

453
01:52:19,361 --> 01:52:22,161
Always calling me.

454
01:54:10,881 --> 01:54:13,971
Just do not want to be loved.

455
01:54:16,851 --> 01:54:18,281
A big man.

456
01:54:20,421 --> 01:54:22,611
I am nothing.

457
01:54:27,031 --> 01:54:29,791
Look, the glory all around us.

458
01:54:33,201 --> 01:54:35,391
Dreams and prayers.

459
01:54:38,701 --> 01:54:41,641
Pay attention.

460
01:54:44,211 --> 01:54:46,941
I have dishonored the Lord because I did not notice the glory.

461
01:54:53,691 --> 01:54:55,521
I'm just a man.

462
01:55:00,661 --> 01:55:02,181
They will close the plant.

463
01:55:06,001 --> 01:55:07,861
They gave me an option.

464
01:55:11,401 --> 01:55:12,731
No job

465
01:55:15,871 --> 01:55:19,211
or I can transfer to a job that nobody wants.

466
01:55:28,451 --> 01:55:29,721
Father.

467
01:55:32,761 --> 01:55:34,821
Never missed a day of work.

468
01:55:35,661 --> 01:55:37,531
Mother.

469
01:55:38,131 --> 01:55:40,561
Every Sunday.

470
01:55:44,001 --> 01:55:47,271
Always restlessness within me.

471
01:55:51,781 --> 01:55:53,801
Always will be.

472
01:55:55,151 --> 01:55:57,511
Do you know Jack? All that I've always wanted for you is ...

473
01:55:59,551 --> 01:56:04,281
... To be strong and grow up being your own boss.

474
01:56:08,261 --> 01:56:09,991
Maybe I've been hard on you.

475
01:56:12,461 --> 01:56:13,931
I'm not proud of that.

476
01:56:15,901 --> 01:56:18,301
I want to grow like you.

477
01:56:21,711 --> 01:56:23,701
I'm more like you like her.

478
01:56:32,581 --> 01:56:35,991
Well, do not tell what Otherwise I'll be in trouble.

479
01:56:44,561 --> 01:56:46,531
Everything you always wanted.

480
01:56:55,041 --> 01:56:56,301
That's my boy.

481
01:59:03,001 --> 01:59:05,401
Are you going to stay there as a bump in the road?

482
02:00:17,881 --> 02:00:20,211
The only way to be happy is to love.

483
02:00:24,881 --> 02:00:26,681
Unless you love,

484
02:00:28,791 --> 02:00:30,981
your life will pass in front of your eyes.

485
02:00:41,971 --> 02:00:43,591
Be nice to them.

486
02:00:48,671 --> 02:00:49,971
Maravilla.

487
02:00:54,711 --> 02:00:56,201
Hope.

488
02:01:48,601 --> 02:01:50,071
Brother.

489
02:02:39,551 --> 02:02:42,211
Protect us.

490
02:02:50,501 --> 02:02:52,621
Guide us

491
02:03:01,771 --> 02:03:03,931
to eternity.

492
02:03:46,321 --> 02:03:48,151
Follow me.

493
02:10:53,081 --> 02:10:54,981
I give you.

494
02:11:00,221 --> 02:11:01,881
I give to my children.
