2
00:01:16,701 --> 00:01:18,368
Brother.

3
00:01:24,167 --> 00:01:25,834
Mother.

4
00:01:31,132 --> 00:01:33,842
It was they who led me
to your door.

5
00:02:04,207 --> 00:02:07,376
Τhe nuns taught us
there are two ways through life...

6
00:02:09,045 --> 00:02:11,797
the way of nature...

7
00:02:11,881 --> 00:02:14,049
and the way of grace.

8
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:17,636
You have to choose which one
you'll follow.

9
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,651
Grace doesn't try
to please itself.

10
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:39,825
Accepts being slighted,
forgotten, disliked.

11
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:46,999
Accepts insults and injuries.

12
00:02:58,469 --> 00:02:59,970
Ooh!

13
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:08,645
Nature only wants
to please itself.

14
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:12,858
Bless, O Lord, this food to our
use- Get others to please it too.

15
00:03:12,942 --> 00:03:14,610
...your loving and faithful service.

16
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:16,445
Likes to lord it over them.

17
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:18,447
Bless these boys.

18
00:03:18,531 --> 00:03:21,033
To have its own way.

19
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:28,040
It finds reasons
to be unhappy...

20
00:03:28,124 --> 00:03:31,460
when all the world
is shining around it,

21
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:35,297
when love is smiling
through all things.

22
00:03:50,605 --> 00:03:54,358
Τhey taught us that no one
who loves the way of grace...

23
00:03:54,442 --> 00:03:57,152
ever comes to a bad end.

24
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:06,870
I will be true to you.

25
00:04:08,873 --> 00:04:10,207
Whatever comes.

26
00:05:00,383 --> 00:05:01,675
Oh, God!

27
00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:33,558
My son.

28
00:06:41,484 --> 00:06:44,861
I just want to die...

29
00:06:44,946 --> 00:06:46,947
to be with him.

30
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:30,073
He's in God's hands now.

31
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:38,707
Ηe was in God's
hands the whole time.

32
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:43,378
Wasn't he?

33
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:49,384
My hope.

34
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,807
My God.

35
00:08:02,398 --> 00:08:04,524
"I shall fear no evil...

36
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:08,570
fear no evil,
for you are with me."

37
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:10,614
What did you gain?

38
00:08:10,698 --> 00:08:12,991
"Be not far from me,
for trouble is near."

39
00:08:13,075 --> 00:08:15,285
Okay, go on now.
We're all right.

40
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:20,332
We're all right.

41
00:08:29,133 --> 00:08:31,259
Τhank you. Thank you.

42
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:40,185
Sure, you have your
memories of him, and, uh...

43
00:08:40,269 --> 00:08:42,437
you're gonna have
to be strong now and...

44
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:48,443
I know the pain will...

45
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:50,403
It will pass in time, you know?

46
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:53,198
It might seem... hard,
my saying that,

47
00:08:53,282 --> 00:08:54,824
but it's true.

48
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:56,910
I don't want it to.

49
00:08:59,497 --> 00:09:01,456
Life goes on.

50
00:09:03,417 --> 00:09:05,335
People pass along.

51
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:09,464
Nothing stays the same.

52
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:15,053
You've still got the other two.

53
00:09:21,185 --> 00:09:23,728
The Lord gives,
and the Lord takes away,

54
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:25,939
and...

55
00:09:26,023 --> 00:09:28,024
that's the way he is.

56
00:09:34,156 --> 00:09:36,449
He sends flies to wounds...

57
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:38,702
that he should heal.

58
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:58,888
I never got a chance
to tell him how sorry l was.

59
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:07,188
One night he...

60
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:12,861
punched him- himself
in the face for no reason.

61
00:10:20,202 --> 00:10:22,162
He was sitting next to me
at the piano,

62
00:10:22,246 --> 00:10:24,914
and l criticized the way
he turned the pages.

63
00:10:42,933 --> 00:10:45,310
I made him feel shame.

64
00:10:46,937 --> 00:10:48,605
My shame.

65
00:10:53,569 --> 00:10:56,321
That poor boy.

66
00:10:56,405 --> 00:10:58,365
That poor boy.

67
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:30,105
How did you come to me?

68
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:39,280
In what shape?

69
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:45,453
What disguise?

70
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:11,289
I see the child that l was.

71
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:23,384
I see my brother.

72
00:13:26,263 --> 00:13:27,931
Τrue.

73
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:31,518
Kind.

74
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:41,486
Ηe died when he was 1 9.

75
00:14:14,103 --> 00:14:17,313
Just check this-
this one against this.

76
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:21,276
She wants to get back together,
but... that chapter's closed,

77
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,278
story's been told.

78
00:14:24,446 --> 00:14:26,447
What are you gonna do?

79
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:29,534
Experiment.

80
00:14:33,163 --> 00:14:35,790
When you're young,
it's all about your career.

81
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:38,918
Υou don't understand anything.

82
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:50,138
I just feel like I'm bumping into walls.

83
00:15:02,818 --> 00:15:05,570
I didn't know how to do her hair.

84
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:30,386
Hey, Dad. I'm sorry
I said what I said. I...

85
00:15:37,061 --> 00:15:39,479
Υeah. Yeah, l think
about him every day.

86
00:15:39,563 --> 00:15:43,191
I just shouldn't have said
what I did, and I'm sorry.

87
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:49,822
No, it's just, oh, this day.

88
00:15:51,825 --> 00:15:53,534
What are you thinkin'?

89
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:55,954
I know- l know you
did everything you could.

90
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:59,165
And only two of
those were turned down by the client.

91
00:15:59,249 --> 00:16:00,917
One of them...

92
00:16:20,854 --> 00:16:23,022
How did I lose you?

93
00:16:30,197 --> 00:16:31,864
Wandered?

94
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:38,079
Forgot you?

95
00:17:37,765 --> 00:17:39,682
Find me.

96
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,501
How did she bear it?

97
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:17,929
Mother.

98
00:18:55,551 --> 00:18:57,760
Was I false to you?

99
00:19:44,474 --> 00:19:46,142
Lord.

100
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:55,109
Why?

101
00:20:02,784 --> 00:20:04,785
Where were you?

102
00:21:06,348 --> 00:21:08,516
Did you know?

103
00:21:24,408 --> 00:21:26,409
Who are we to you?

104
00:21:46,054 --> 00:21:48,055
Answer me.

105
00:25:58,974 --> 00:26:01,141
We cry to you.

106
00:26:07,649 --> 00:26:09,483
My soul.

107
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:19,827
My son.

108
00:26:28,169 --> 00:26:29,837
Ηear us.

109
00:34:34,322 --> 00:34:36,573
Light of my life.

110
00:34:39,827 --> 00:34:41,995
I search for you.

111
00:34:46,417 --> 00:34:48,085
My hope.

112
00:34:58,554 --> 00:35:00,514
My child.

113
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:22,345
You spoke to me through her.

114
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:28,685
You spoke with me from the sky.

115
00:36:30,646 --> 00:36:32,314
Τhe trees.

116
00:36:37,236 --> 00:36:39,613
Before I knew l loved you,

117
00:36:41,991 --> 00:36:43,992
believed in you.

118
00:37:02,386 --> 00:37:05,138
When did you first
touch my heart?

119
00:39:39,919 --> 00:39:42,170
And manfully to
fight under his banner...

120
00:39:42,254 --> 00:39:44,756
against sin,
the world and the devil.

121
00:40:25,631 --> 00:40:27,966
We had the commander
over for dinner.

122
00:40:28,050 --> 00:40:30,552
This little devil bit him
right on the ankle.

123
00:40:48,779 --> 00:40:50,697
Mama!

124
00:41:02,418 --> 00:41:03,710
Me!

125
00:42:10,986 --> 00:42:13,029
Rhinoceros.

126
00:42:13,113 --> 00:42:14,822
Two alligator.

127
00:42:14,907 --> 00:42:16,741
Two alligators.

128
00:42:21,288 --> 00:42:24,874
Kangaroo. Kangaroo.

129
00:42:35,386 --> 00:42:36,636
Jump.

130
00:43:03,872 --> 00:43:06,708
Mmm.

131
00:43:27,605 --> 00:43:29,397
Ah!

132
00:43:40,409 --> 00:43:44,078
Sweetheart.

133
00:43:45,497 --> 00:43:48,583
Shh! Please.

134
00:43:50,294 --> 00:43:52,754
I know. No!

135
00:43:52,838 --> 00:43:54,672
No!

136
00:44:19,031 --> 00:44:21,199
It's mine!

137
00:44:24,662 --> 00:44:26,371
You found me.

138
00:45:02,616 --> 00:45:05,743
You'll be grown
before that tree is tall.

139
00:45:10,082 --> 00:45:12,208
Blue. Far.

140
00:45:14,962 --> 00:45:17,130
You.

141
00:45:29,268 --> 00:45:30,768
Are you afraid?

142
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:34,647
Come here.

143
00:46:27,826 --> 00:46:30,870
Come here. All right. Now, come back here, Son.
Stay out of there.

144
00:46:30,954 --> 00:46:32,789
Τhat's the Spencers' yard.
Okay?

145
00:46:32,873 --> 00:46:37,126
You see this line? Let's not cross it.
Do you understand?

146
00:46:37,211 --> 00:46:39,962
Ηmm? Do you understand?

147
00:46:40,047 --> 00:46:42,840
You see this line?
Lookit here. Look here.

148
00:46:44,676 --> 00:46:47,178
Okay. Now, come back here, Son.
Come on back.

149
00:46:54,353 --> 00:46:56,020
Stay out of there.

150
00:47:12,913 --> 00:47:16,415
"'Now, my dears, ' said old
Mrs. Rabbit one morning,"

151
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:18,876
'you may go into the fields
or down the lane,

152
00:47:20,045 --> 00:47:22,505
but don't go
into Mr. McGregor's garden:

153
00:47:23,507 --> 00:47:25,633
Father had an accident there."'.

154
00:47:32,266 --> 00:47:34,976
That's where God lives.

155
00:48:01,795 --> 00:48:06,173
Good night.
We'll see ya in five years.

156
00:49:02,397 --> 00:49:04,941
You want to eat a grasshopper?

157
00:49:05,025 --> 00:49:07,485
I found a dinosaur bone!

158
00:49:07,569 --> 00:49:08,903
Oh!

159
00:49:08,987 --> 00:49:10,905
Ls that a rock? No.

160
00:49:16,411 --> 00:49:17,745
Ah.

161
00:49:20,499 --> 00:49:22,166
Hey!

162
00:49:36,098 --> 00:49:37,765
Boys!

163
00:49:38,767 --> 00:49:40,101
Come home!

164
00:49:44,731 --> 00:49:46,399
Boys!

165
00:49:54,199 --> 00:49:56,534
Come home!

166
00:50:08,922 --> 00:50:11,173
You're a "potleak" now!

167
00:50:11,258 --> 00:50:14,010
You're filthy!

168
00:50:19,099 --> 00:50:23,978
Bless this food to our use and us to
your loving and faithful service,

169
00:50:24,062 --> 00:50:27,606
and make us ever mindful
of those who are in need.

170
00:50:27,691 --> 00:50:29,358
Amen.

171
00:50:36,450 --> 00:50:39,410
Can you pass the butter,
please?

172
00:50:39,494 --> 00:50:42,288
"Can you pass the butter,
please, sir?" Sir.

173
00:50:44,124 --> 00:50:45,916
What'd you do today?

174
00:50:46,918 --> 00:50:49,295
Went to school. After that?

175
00:50:50,714 --> 00:50:54,550
What about the yard?
Did you put the runners in like I asked?

176
00:50:56,303 --> 00:50:57,762
Yeah.

177
00:50:57,846 --> 00:50:59,513
Yes, sir.

178
00:51:01,266 --> 00:51:03,601
Well, it didn't look like it.

179
00:51:19,326 --> 00:51:20,993
Ηmm? Yes.

180
00:51:34,216 --> 00:51:36,217
Mr. Reese liked
Jack's book report...

181
00:51:36,301 --> 00:51:38,677
What is that, sweetheart?
And wanted him to make a model.

182
00:51:39,679 --> 00:51:41,764
You know this?

183
00:51:51,191 --> 00:51:53,317
Brahms.

184
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:06,831
Son?

185
00:52:06,915 --> 00:52:08,249
Sir?

186
00:52:09,376 --> 00:52:11,710
Reach me my lighter.

187
00:52:19,219 --> 00:52:21,220
Haven't you
forgotten somethin'?

188
00:52:46,204 --> 00:52:48,205
Do you love your father?

189
00:52:49,332 --> 00:52:51,000
Yes, sir.

190
00:52:53,044 --> 00:52:55,588
"...against the Panther,"

191
00:52:55,672 --> 00:52:59,300
and they went off to look
for Kaa the Rock Python.

192
00:53:01,803 --> 00:53:06,682
Τhey found him stretched out on a
warm ledge in the afternoon sun,

193
00:53:06,766 --> 00:53:09,268
"admiring his
beautiful new coat."

194
00:53:18,945 --> 00:53:20,946
Who do you love the most?

195
00:53:26,286 --> 00:53:28,787
I love you all three the same.

196
00:53:30,457 --> 00:53:33,459
Τell us a story
from before we can remember.

197
00:53:37,297 --> 00:53:39,298
Went for a ride in a plane once.

198
00:53:43,053 --> 00:53:45,387
It was a graduation present.

199
00:54:00,862 --> 00:54:02,529
Mother.

200
00:54:11,206 --> 00:54:13,165
Make me good.

201
00:54:20,674 --> 00:54:22,341
Brave.

202
00:55:41,838 --> 00:55:45,049
Aah! Aah!

203
00:57:21,521 --> 00:57:23,897
Can it happen to anyone?

204
00:57:24,899 --> 00:57:26,567
Shh.

205
00:57:30,530 --> 00:57:32,698
Nobody talks about it.

206
00:57:37,036 --> 00:57:38,871
Help me not to sass my dad.

207
00:57:41,374 --> 00:57:44,543
Help me not to get dogs in fights.

208
00:57:58,725 --> 00:58:01,727
Ηelp me be thankful
for everything I've got.

209
00:58:03,855 --> 00:58:06,023
Where do you live?

210
00:58:07,025 --> 00:58:08,859
Ηelp me not to tell lies.

211
00:58:16,576 --> 00:58:18,869
Are you watching me?

212
00:58:28,838 --> 00:58:31,006
I want to know what you are.

213
00:58:37,639 --> 00:58:40,224
I want to see what you see.

214
00:59:32,944 --> 00:59:35,237
Come here, you!

215
00:59:35,321 --> 00:59:38,365
Come here. Come here, you!

216
00:59:40,368 --> 00:59:42,160
That funny?

217
00:59:48,334 --> 00:59:52,004
You're gonna stand there, and you're
gonna close this door quietly 50 times.

218
00:59:53,423 --> 00:59:55,924
Count it out.

219
00:59:56,009 --> 00:59:59,094
Three, four,

220
00:59:59,178 --> 01:00:02,014
five, six,

221
01:00:02,098 --> 01:00:04,766
seven, eight...

222
01:00:04,851 --> 01:00:08,395
You can't just yank off the top.
You gotta get it by the root.

223
01:00:16,195 --> 01:00:18,155
Your mother's naive. Whoa!

224
01:00:18,239 --> 01:00:21,074
It takes fierce will
to get ahead in this world.

225
01:00:22,702 --> 01:00:25,370
If you're good,
people take advantage of you.

226
01:00:31,711 --> 01:00:35,172
Every one of these top executives-
you know how they got where they are?

227
01:00:35,256 --> 01:00:38,884
Floated right down the middle of the river.

228
01:00:40,219 --> 01:00:43,722
Don't let anyone tell you
there's anything you can't do.

229
01:00:45,516 --> 01:00:48,518
Don't do like l did.
Promise me that.

230
01:00:50,563 --> 01:00:52,564
I dreamed of being
a great musician.

231
01:00:53,566 --> 01:00:56,985
I let myself get sidetracked.

232
01:00:57,070 --> 01:00:59,821
If you're lookin' for somethin'
to happen, that was it.

233
01:00:59,906 --> 01:01:01,615
That was life. You lived it.

234
01:01:18,466 --> 01:01:22,594
Job imagined he might
build his nest on high,

235
01:01:22,679 --> 01:01:27,432
that the integrity of his behavior
would protect him against misfortune.

236
01:01:27,517 --> 01:01:29,434
And his friends thought,
mistakenly,

237
01:01:29,519 --> 01:01:32,270
that the Lord could only
have punished him...

238
01:01:32,355 --> 01:01:35,982
because secretly
he'd done something wrong.

239
01:01:36,067 --> 01:01:37,567
But no.

240
01:01:37,652 --> 01:01:41,196
Misfortune befalls
the good as well.

241
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:43,490
We can't protect ourselves
against it.

242
01:01:43,574 --> 01:01:46,034
We can't protect our children.

243
01:01:46,119 --> 01:01:48,995
We can't say to ourselves,
"Even if I'm not happy,

244
01:01:49,080 --> 01:01:51,832
I'm going to make sure they are."

245
01:01:51,916 --> 01:01:53,834
We run before the wind.

246
01:01:53,918 --> 01:01:56,670
We think that it will
carry us forever.

247
01:01:56,754 --> 01:01:58,296
It will not.

248
01:01:58,381 --> 01:02:00,215
We vanish as a cloud.

249
01:02:00,299 --> 01:02:02,592
We wither
as the autumn grass...

250
01:02:02,677 --> 01:02:05,971
and, like a tree,
are rooted up.

251
01:02:08,099 --> 01:02:11,351
Is there some fraud
in the scheme of the universe?

252
01:02:11,436 --> 01:02:13,812
Is there nothing
which is deathless,

253
01:02:13,896 --> 01:02:16,815
nothing which
does not pass away?

254
01:02:18,943 --> 01:02:21,153
We cannot stay where we are.

255
01:02:21,237 --> 01:02:23,530
We must journey forth.

256
01:02:23,614 --> 01:02:28,076
We must find that which
is greater than fortune or fate.

257
01:02:29,078 --> 01:02:32,289
Nothing can bring us peace
but that.

258
01:02:33,332 --> 01:02:36,543
Is the body of the wise man
or the just...

259
01:02:36,627 --> 01:02:38,545
exempt from any pain,

260
01:02:38,629 --> 01:02:40,756
from any disquietude,

261
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:43,592
from the deformity
that might blight its beauty,

262
01:02:43,676 --> 01:02:46,845
from the weakness
that might destroy its health?

263
01:02:48,890 --> 01:02:51,767
Do you trust in God?

264
01:02:51,851 --> 01:02:55,604
Job, too, was close to the Lord.

265
01:02:55,688 --> 01:02:58,356
Are your friends and children
your security?

266
01:02:59,859 --> 01:03:02,110
There is no hiding place
in all the world...

267
01:03:02,195 --> 01:03:04,488
where trouble may not find you.

268
01:03:04,572 --> 01:03:07,365
No one knows when sorrow
might visit his house...

269
01:03:07,450 --> 01:03:10,577
any more than Job did.

270
01:03:10,661 --> 01:03:13,789
The very moment everything
was taken away from Job,

271
01:03:13,873 --> 01:03:17,042
he knew it was the Lord
who'd taken it away.

272
01:03:19,253 --> 01:03:22,297
Ηe turned from
the passing shows of time.

273
01:03:22,381 --> 01:03:24,841
Ηe sought
that which is eternal.

274
01:03:26,219 --> 01:03:30,597
Does he alone see God's hand
who sees that he gives?

275
01:03:30,681 --> 01:03:32,724
Or does not, also,
the one see God's hand...

276
01:03:32,809 --> 01:03:36,311
I'm your man.
Who sees that he takes away?

277
01:03:36,395 --> 01:03:38,897
Or does he alone see God,

278
01:03:38,981 --> 01:03:41,191
who sees God
turn his face towards him?

279
01:03:43,152 --> 01:03:46,738
Does not, also, he see God...

280
01:03:46,823 --> 01:03:48,490
who sees God turn his back?

281
01:03:48,574 --> 01:03:51,409
That's a friend of mine.
He owns half the real estate in town.

282
01:03:53,579 --> 01:03:55,247
Frank Johnson.

283
01:03:56,249 --> 01:03:59,251
He started out as a barber.

284
01:04:00,503 --> 01:04:04,089
But he built something big.

285
01:04:04,173 --> 01:04:07,259
Now you'd think he's the fourth
person of the holy Trinity.

286
01:04:09,387 --> 01:04:11,930
They never talk
about their money.

287
01:04:14,809 --> 01:04:16,810
Wrong people go hungry,

288
01:04:18,437 --> 01:04:20,063
die.

289
01:04:22,108 --> 01:04:25,110
Wrong people get loved.

290
01:04:26,904 --> 01:04:28,947
The world lives by trickery.

291
01:04:31,784 --> 01:04:34,786
If you want to succeed,
you can't be too good.

292
01:04:42,295 --> 01:04:45,297
Ηey there, young fellas.
How's it going today?

293
01:04:46,299 --> 01:04:48,300
Do y'all want some barbecue?

294
01:04:50,469 --> 01:04:52,679
How about a pound of brisket?

295
01:05:20,082 --> 01:05:23,209
You're like this, right? Okay?
Come on. You act like you're scared.

296
01:05:23,294 --> 01:05:25,503
You act like you're in trouble.
You don't wanna fight. Nah.

297
01:05:25,588 --> 01:05:28,673
You don't want any trouble.
The minute you see him blink, crack him, okay?

298
01:05:28,758 --> 01:05:31,051
Okay. Okay? Come on.
Three quarters.

299
01:05:31,135 --> 01:05:34,179
Cover. You're gonna cover, right?
Okay. Hit it. Come on.

300
01:05:34,263 --> 01:05:37,515
Nice. Nice. Ηarder. Nice.
That's a good right. Let's see your left.

301
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:40,226
That's the most important thing, okay?
You come in this way?

302
01:05:40,311 --> 01:05:43,146
You come in this way? You keep the guard up.
Hit me! Come on, hit me.

303
01:05:43,230 --> 01:05:47,692
Come on! Come on, Jack! Hit me.
Ηit me. Ηit me. Come on. Come on.

304
01:05:47,777 --> 01:05:51,071
Ηere. Ηere it is. Here it is. Ηit it.
Come on, Son! Come on! Son.

305
01:05:51,155 --> 01:05:53,573
Left. What are you doing?

306
01:05:57,203 --> 01:06:00,080
Dust yourself off.

307
01:06:00,164 --> 01:06:03,625
Left. Don't leave your tongue out.
You're gonna lose it.

308
01:06:03,709 --> 01:06:05,794
Left. Left.

309
01:06:05,878 --> 01:06:07,629
Right. Right.

310
01:06:07,713 --> 01:06:11,174
Left. Harder. Harder. Harder!

311
01:06:11,258 --> 01:06:13,468
Come on, hit me. Hit me.

312
01:06:13,552 --> 01:06:16,221
Come on, Son. Ηit it.
Give me something.

313
01:06:16,305 --> 01:06:18,306
Show me what you got.

314
01:06:19,892 --> 01:06:21,893
Come on. Go on.

315
01:06:27,608 --> 01:06:29,275
One meal.

316
01:06:44,500 --> 01:06:46,418
Leave the table.

317
01:06:52,299 --> 01:06:53,967
You too?

318
01:06:55,594 --> 01:06:57,637
You gonna continue to defy me?
No, sir.

319
01:06:57,722 --> 01:07:00,765
You interrupted me.
I wasn't done yet.

320
01:07:03,769 --> 01:07:05,603
Am l finished?

321
01:07:06,605 --> 01:07:08,273
May l?

322
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:12,110
Thank you, Your Majesty.

323
01:08:08,584 --> 01:08:10,752
Makes up stories.

324
01:08:13,839 --> 01:08:15,757
Original words.

325
01:08:23,808 --> 01:08:26,893
Ηe says, "Don't put your
elbows on the table."

326
01:08:26,977 --> 01:08:28,770
Are you ready?

327
01:08:28,854 --> 01:08:30,814
He does.

328
01:08:34,276 --> 01:08:36,194
Insults people.

329
01:08:37,655 --> 01:08:39,280
Doesn't care.

330
01:08:39,365 --> 01:08:41,699
I remember when you were born.

331
01:08:46,831 --> 01:08:48,832
Τhey wouldn't let me come home.

332
01:08:50,543 --> 01:08:54,003
The navy said an officer must be present
for the laying of the keel,

333
01:08:54,088 --> 01:08:58,091
but... not at the launching.

334
01:09:42,136 --> 01:09:44,429
The next word is "volcano."

335
01:09:54,940 --> 01:09:56,983
The next word is "socket."

336
01:10:03,032 --> 01:10:06,868
Please pass your answers to each other.
We're gonna grade each other's papers now.

337
01:10:12,666 --> 01:10:14,584
No interruptions, please.

338
01:10:16,378 --> 01:10:18,880
Come on. Get your pencil out.

339
01:10:23,802 --> 01:10:26,304
After logs
go to the paper mill...

340
01:11:39,503 --> 01:11:43,131
Τaylor! Taylor, sweetheart!

341
01:11:43,215 --> 01:11:45,550
Honey! Honey!

342
01:11:52,391 --> 01:11:53,850
Let me go!

343
01:13:13,847 --> 01:13:15,681
Was he bad?

344
01:13:25,275 --> 01:13:27,777
Will you die too?

345
01:13:30,572 --> 01:13:33,116
You're not that old yet, Mom.

346
01:13:50,801 --> 01:13:52,635
Where were you?

347
01:14:04,815 --> 01:14:06,732
You let a boy die.

348
01:14:13,699 --> 01:14:16,200
You'll let anything happen.

349
01:14:29,465 --> 01:14:32,925
I can't see!

350
01:14:36,597 --> 01:14:38,556
Why should I be good...

351
01:14:42,561 --> 01:14:45,229
if you aren't?

352
01:15:34,112 --> 01:15:35,780
Thank you.

353
01:15:50,462 --> 01:15:53,047
Too close.

354
01:15:53,131 --> 01:15:55,132
Edges.

355
01:15:55,217 --> 01:15:57,718
Why's this bare here, hmm?

356
01:15:57,803 --> 01:16:01,138
Grass won't grow under the trees.
Does at the Kimballs'.

357
01:16:01,223 --> 01:16:04,350
They have a yardman.
They have money.

358
01:16:04,434 --> 01:16:06,435
Course, he inherited it.

359
01:16:08,438 --> 01:16:11,857
I don't want to hear one more word out
of you, not till this is finished.

360
01:16:23,662 --> 01:16:25,246
Ηmm?

361
01:16:29,293 --> 01:16:30,876
Ηmm?

362
01:16:52,733 --> 01:16:54,400
Cropping that too close.

363
01:16:54,484 --> 01:16:56,193
You're gonna have to
keep that watered.

364
01:17:03,577 --> 01:17:05,494
Not high enough.

365
01:17:23,764 --> 01:17:25,640
Toscanini...

366
01:17:25,724 --> 01:17:27,975
once recorded a piece 65 times.

367
01:17:28,060 --> 01:17:30,478
You know what he said
when he finished?

368
01:17:30,562 --> 01:17:32,605
"It could be better."

369
01:17:34,066 --> 01:17:35,733
Think about it.

370
01:17:38,278 --> 01:17:40,780
Twenty-seven patents
your father has.

371
01:17:42,324 --> 01:17:45,242
It means ownership.
Ownership of ideas.

372
01:17:46,828 --> 01:17:49,121
You gotta sew 'em up.
Get 'em by the nuts...

373
01:17:49,206 --> 01:17:51,749
We'll get 'em next time.
Pardon my French.

374
01:17:51,833 --> 01:17:53,584
We'll be rich.

375
01:17:56,672 --> 01:17:59,173
You make yourself what you are.

376
01:18:02,761 --> 01:18:05,596
You have control
of your own destiny.

377
01:18:08,642 --> 01:18:10,643
You can't say, "I can't."

378
01:18:11,770 --> 01:18:13,729
You say, "I'm having trouble.

379
01:18:14,940 --> 01:18:16,732
I'm not done yet."

380
01:18:18,485 --> 01:18:20,945
You can't say, "I can't."

381
01:18:54,813 --> 01:18:57,064
Why does he hurt us?

382
01:18:59,359 --> 01:19:01,026
Our father.

383
01:19:06,992 --> 01:19:08,826
Come on, Dix. Come on!

384
01:19:08,910 --> 01:19:10,286
Ah, yeah. Get it! Get it!

385
01:19:24,509 --> 01:19:26,594
Give your father a kiss.

386
01:20:05,801 --> 01:20:07,384
He lies.

387
01:20:11,056 --> 01:20:13,390
Pretends.
Can you do something for me?

388
01:20:13,475 --> 01:20:15,935
You promise you'll do it
without having to ask what it is?

389
01:20:16,019 --> 01:20:18,646
Just have the confidence that what
your father asks of you is right?

390
01:20:18,730 --> 01:20:20,523
Yes, sir.

391
01:20:20,607 --> 01:20:25,361
For the next half hour, will you not speak
unless you have something important to say?

392
01:20:30,742 --> 01:20:33,244
What'd you do today,
my fine feathered friend?

393
01:20:35,080 --> 01:20:39,500
Sit on the front two inches of your chair.
Better for your posture.

394
01:20:39,584 --> 01:20:41,585
I read that in the paper.

395
01:20:44,673 --> 01:20:48,050
Did you actually buy this
from Mr. Ledbetter?

396
01:20:48,134 --> 01:20:50,803
Don't explain.
Just nod- yes or no.

397
01:20:52,055 --> 01:20:53,722
Ηmm? No.

398
01:20:56,226 --> 01:20:57,560
Be quiet.

399
01:21:00,564 --> 01:21:02,565
What did you say?

400
01:21:05,318 --> 01:21:06,986
Please.

401
01:21:07,070 --> 01:21:08,696
Leave him alone! Come here!

402
01:21:08,780 --> 01:21:10,990
Honey!

403
01:21:11,074 --> 01:21:14,577
[ Record Player Needle
Scratches ] Leave him alone!

404
01:21:17,873 --> 01:21:20,291
Come here! Get back. Come here.

405
01:21:24,588 --> 01:21:26,505
Get up there!

406
01:22:22,687 --> 01:22:24,480
You turned my own kids
against me.

407
01:22:26,149 --> 01:22:28,108
You undermine everything I do.

408
01:22:37,369 --> 01:22:38,994
Ηow do you like- Stop...

409
01:22:39,788 --> 01:22:41,121
Stop it.

410
01:22:41,206 --> 01:22:44,375
Stop it! Stop. Stop it.

411
01:22:48,421 --> 01:22:54,218
Stop it.

412
01:22:59,724 --> 01:23:01,892
Stop. Stop.

413
01:25:00,970 --> 01:25:02,846
Where's Dad?

414
01:25:02,931 --> 01:25:05,015
He's gone on a trip.

415
01:25:14,234 --> 01:25:18,195
Whoo!

416
01:25:24,536 --> 01:25:26,036
No!

417
01:25:35,672 --> 01:25:37,548
Open the door!

418
01:25:48,685 --> 01:25:50,144
Get her! No!

419
01:25:50,228 --> 01:25:51,770
Help each other.

420
01:25:53,064 --> 01:25:56,066
Do not slam that screen door!

421
01:25:57,819 --> 01:26:00,654
Love everyone.

422
01:26:02,615 --> 01:26:04,575
Every leaf.

423
01:26:06,202 --> 01:26:08,745
Every ray of light.

424
01:26:16,296 --> 01:26:18,213
Forgive.

425
01:26:45,658 --> 01:26:47,576
Τhis is my house!

426
01:26:47,660 --> 01:26:49,411
You're allowed to live here!

427
01:26:49,495 --> 01:26:51,663
You are allowed to live here!

428
01:26:53,333 --> 01:26:55,167
Get out of my way!

429
01:26:55,251 --> 01:26:57,044
No!

430
01:26:57,128 --> 01:26:58,962
Shut up!

431
01:27:13,311 --> 01:27:16,313
I got it, I got it, I got it!

432
01:27:53,726 --> 01:27:56,395
Boom! Boom! Boom, boom!
Boom, boom!

433
01:27:56,479 --> 01:27:58,146
Watch out! Watch out!

434
01:27:58,231 --> 01:28:00,649
Go!

435
01:28:06,781 --> 01:28:09,491
One, two, three!

436
01:28:17,667 --> 01:28:19,376
I say let's bust 'em.

437
01:28:32,265 --> 01:28:33,890
Yeah! Yeah!

438
01:28:43,401 --> 01:28:44,651
Yeah!

439
01:28:45,737 --> 01:28:47,070
We found a frog!

440
01:28:48,656 --> 01:28:50,449
Let's go set it off
with a skyrocket!

441
01:28:50,533 --> 01:28:52,075
He's getting away!

442
01:28:53,953 --> 01:28:55,912
Get back! Get back!

443
01:29:03,087 --> 01:29:04,963
Did it go to the moon?

444
01:29:07,759 --> 01:29:09,343
Where is he?

445
01:29:09,427 --> 01:29:11,094
Here he is.

446
01:29:13,056 --> 01:29:15,098
It was an experiment!

447
01:29:19,270 --> 01:29:20,604
Liar.

448
01:29:22,774 --> 01:29:24,608
Never do it again.

449
01:29:25,610 --> 01:29:27,110
Promise?

450
01:29:30,573 --> 01:29:32,908
You gonna tell Dad?

451
01:29:32,992 --> 01:29:36,119
They're just
trying to scare you.

452
01:29:38,790 --> 01:29:40,582
Keep you ignorant.

453
01:29:44,796 --> 01:29:46,463
Things you got to learn.

454
01:29:50,593 --> 01:29:52,719
Ηow can we know stuff
until we look?

455
01:30:11,197 --> 01:30:14,533
Τhey say you can't try stuff?
They do.

456
01:30:18,788 --> 01:30:20,372
What do you need
to be afraid of?

457
01:30:24,127 --> 01:30:25,752
You're afraid.

458
01:30:27,422 --> 01:30:28,630
I see it.

459
01:30:28,714 --> 01:30:31,341
Right here! Right here!

460
01:35:55,958 --> 01:35:58,168
I can't talk to you.

461
01:36:07,219 --> 01:36:09,596
Don't look at me.

462
01:36:57,228 --> 01:36:58,728
What have I started?

463
01:37:02,775 --> 01:37:04,567
What have l done?

464
01:37:35,182 --> 01:37:36,933
Stick it in there.

465
01:38:16,348 --> 01:38:18,016
I trust you.

466
01:38:33,574 --> 01:38:35,909
You tired? No!

467
01:38:35,993 --> 01:38:38,411
I never get tired!

468
01:38:38,495 --> 01:38:40,914
Did this morning.
No, l was just pretending.

469
01:38:41,916 --> 01:38:44,083
Gonna call me a liar? No.

470
01:38:44,168 --> 01:38:46,085
I don't want to fight.

471
01:38:46,170 --> 01:38:48,254
Afraid to?

472
01:38:48,339 --> 01:38:50,173
No, I just don't wanna.

473
01:38:51,967 --> 01:38:54,677
If I was to say you're scared,
would you call me a liar?

474
01:38:54,762 --> 01:38:55,887
No.

475
01:38:57,139 --> 01:38:59,140
Then you're scared, aren't you?

476
01:39:08,359 --> 01:39:10,193
Aha!

477
01:39:10,277 --> 01:39:11,945
Quit it.

478
01:39:14,406 --> 01:39:15,782
Come here.

479
01:39:59,910 --> 01:40:01,577
Come here!

480
01:40:04,164 --> 01:40:05,748
No!

481
01:40:08,669 --> 01:40:11,212
I'm not gonna do
everything you tell me to.

482
01:40:12,464 --> 01:40:14,757
I'm gonna do what I want.

483
01:40:18,262 --> 01:40:20,930
What do you know?
You let him run all over you.

484
01:41:11,648 --> 01:41:13,649
How do l get back...

485
01:41:19,114 --> 01:41:20,740
where they are?

486
01:41:43,847 --> 01:41:45,848
Ηow are you, Son? Good.

487
01:41:55,526 --> 01:41:58,486
This one's heavy.
You're gonna need two hands for that one.

488
01:42:05,786 --> 01:42:07,286
Whoa.

489
01:42:08,288 --> 01:42:10,456
Careful now.
You know what that...

490
01:42:10,541 --> 01:42:12,250
Chinese?
Know what that- That's Chinese.

491
01:42:12,334 --> 01:42:14,335
That's very good. Yes, it is.

492
01:42:16,004 --> 01:42:18,881
Your father went all around the world,
all the way to China.

493
01:42:18,966 --> 01:42:20,842
Τhat's Pan Am airlines.

494
01:42:20,926 --> 01:42:22,802
That's what your father
flew on.

495
01:42:22,886 --> 01:42:25,847
The entire bathrooms are stainless
steel, even the washbasin.

496
01:42:25,931 --> 01:42:29,267
I feel confident
the deal's going through.

497
01:42:29,351 --> 01:42:32,186
If not, they can forget it.
I'll tell them all to go to hell.

498
01:42:32,271 --> 01:42:34,397
- That's from Germany.
- How do you use them?

499
01:42:34,481 --> 01:42:35,898
See that?

500
01:42:39,069 --> 01:42:40,945
Put that down, Son.

501
01:42:41,029 --> 01:42:43,364
Can Cayler come over?

502
01:42:43,448 --> 01:42:45,908
Ls your family
not good enough for you?

503
01:42:52,040 --> 01:42:55,960
Hope it's not gonna take
as long as last time.

504
01:42:56,044 --> 01:42:57,545
Al dente.

505
01:43:00,883 --> 01:43:03,217
Subjective point of view.
You know the difference?

506
01:43:03,302 --> 01:43:06,387
"Subjective" means it comes from your mind.
Can't be proven by other people.

507
01:43:06,471 --> 01:43:08,556
Mwah.

508
01:43:08,640 --> 01:43:10,141
So- Ηere you go.

509
01:43:10,225 --> 01:43:11,934
Mm, mm, oop, oop, oop.

510
01:43:14,813 --> 01:43:17,023
Good to see you again. Okay.

511
01:43:17,107 --> 01:43:19,192
Let's go, boys.

512
01:43:19,276 --> 01:43:20,610
Come on.

513
01:43:21,904 --> 01:43:23,863
There are things you can't do?

514
01:43:23,947 --> 01:43:25,948
Well, there are things
I can't do either.

515
01:43:27,701 --> 01:43:29,660
You are not to call me "Dad."
You will call me "Father."

516
01:43:29,745 --> 01:43:31,537
But- But- Don't interrupt!

517
01:43:31,622 --> 01:43:33,456
But you do. Don't interrupt!

518
01:43:39,463 --> 01:43:40,922
It's your house.

519
01:43:41,006 --> 01:43:43,216
You can kick me out
whenever you want to.

520
01:43:48,847 --> 01:43:50,932
You'd like to kill me.

521
01:44:09,993 --> 01:44:11,827
No- Dad.

522
01:44:16,291 --> 01:44:18,334
Why was he born?

523
01:45:43,837 --> 01:45:46,339
Please, God, kill him.

524
01:45:50,677 --> 01:45:52,720
Let him die.

525
01:45:57,309 --> 01:45:59,101
Get him out of here.

526
01:46:20,832 --> 01:46:22,792
She only loves me!

527
01:46:34,388 --> 01:46:38,391
Defend, O Lord, this thy
child with thy heavenly grace,

528
01:46:38,475 --> 01:46:41,477
that he may continue
thine forever...

529
01:46:41,561 --> 01:46:45,439
and daily increase in thy
holy spirit more and more...

530
01:46:45,524 --> 01:46:49,527
until he come
unto thy everlasting kingdom.

531
01:46:49,611 --> 01:46:50,945
Amen.

532
01:47:31,820 --> 01:47:33,487
I see something.

533
01:48:24,414 --> 01:48:26,123
Put your finger over it.

534
01:48:28,293 --> 01:48:29,627
Like that.

535
01:48:31,838 --> 01:48:33,088
Come on.

536
01:49:30,480 --> 01:49:33,232
What I want to do, I can't do.

537
01:49:38,905 --> 01:49:40,823
I do what I hate.

538
01:50:42,218 --> 01:50:43,927
You can hit me if you want.

539
01:51:02,030 --> 01:51:03,405
I'm sorry.

540
01:51:06,910 --> 01:51:08,744
You're my brother.

541
01:51:52,831 --> 01:51:54,998
What was it you showed me?

542
01:52:04,134 --> 01:52:07,010
I didn't know
how to name you then.

543
01:52:11,474 --> 01:52:13,600
But l see it was you.

544
01:52:19,357 --> 01:52:21,483
Always you were calling me.

545
01:54:11,135 --> 01:54:14,471
I wanted to be
loved because I was great.

546
01:54:16,933 --> 01:54:18,976
A big man.

547
01:54:21,521 --> 01:54:23,021
I'm nothin'.

548
01:54:26,901 --> 01:54:29,820
Look... at the glory around us.

549
01:54:32,991 --> 01:54:35,492
Trees and birds.

550
01:54:38,997 --> 01:54:40,581
I lived in shame.

551
01:54:44,377 --> 01:54:47,462
I dishonored it all
and didn't notice the glory.

552
01:54:53,511 --> 01:54:55,345
I'm a foolish man.

553
01:55:00,518 --> 01:55:02,519
Τhey're closing the plant.

554
01:55:06,566 --> 01:55:09,109
Τhey gave me a choice.

555
01:55:11,487 --> 01:55:13,280
No job...

556
01:55:16,034 --> 01:55:19,369
or a transfer
to a job nobody wants.

557
01:55:28,338 --> 01:55:30,005
Father.

558
01:55:32,342 --> 01:55:35,260
I never missed a day of work.

559
01:55:35,345 --> 01:55:37,304
Mother.

560
01:55:37,388 --> 01:55:40,015
I tithed every Sunday.

561
01:55:43,561 --> 01:55:46,605
Always you wrestle inside me.

562
01:55:51,569 --> 01:55:53,570
Always you will.

563
01:55:55,531 --> 01:55:59,785
You know, Jack, all l ever
wanted for you was...

564
01:55:59,869 --> 01:56:02,704
to make you strong and...

565
01:56:02,789 --> 01:56:04,873
and grow up
and be your own boss.

566
01:56:08,294 --> 01:56:10,462
Maybe I've been tough on you.

567
01:56:12,340 --> 01:56:14,383
I'm not proud of that.

568
01:56:16,678 --> 01:56:18,720
I'm as bad as you are.

569
01:56:21,224 --> 01:56:23,892
I'm more like you than her.

570
01:56:32,485 --> 01:56:35,737
You boys are about all I've done in life.
Otherwise I've drawn zilch.

571
01:56:44,497 --> 01:56:46,957
You're all l have.
You're all I want to have.

572
01:56:54,924 --> 01:56:56,883
My sweet boy.

573
01:59:03,719 --> 01:59:06,263
You just gonna stand there
like a bump on a log?

574
01:59:10,560 --> 01:59:12,060
Go on.

575
01:59:16,607 --> 01:59:18,108
Come on.

576
02:00:17,835 --> 02:00:20,503
The only way
to be happy is to love.

577
02:00:24,842 --> 02:00:26,718
Unless you love,

578
02:00:28,679 --> 02:00:30,680
your life will flash by.

579
02:00:41,859 --> 02:00:43,860
Do good to them.

580
02:00:48,658 --> 02:00:50,116
Wonder.

581
02:00:54,872 --> 02:00:56,373
Ηope.

582
02:01:48,509 --> 02:01:50,385
Brother.

583
02:02:40,519 --> 02:02:42,812
Keep us,

584
02:02:50,363 --> 02:02:52,113
guide us...

585
02:03:01,624 --> 02:03:03,917
till the end of time.

586
02:03:46,502 --> 02:03:48,461
Follow me.

587
02:10:53,262 --> 02:10:54,971
I give him to you.

588
02:10:59,643 --> 02:11:01,394
I give you my son.
