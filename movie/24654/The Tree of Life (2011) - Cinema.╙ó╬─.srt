1<br />
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:48,580<br />
Brother...<br />
<br />
2<br />
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:56,080<br />
Mother...<br />
<br />
3<br />
00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:03,530<br />
It was they who led me to your door.<br />
<br />
4<br />
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,930<br />
A man's heart has heard two ways through life.<br />
<br />
5<br />
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:40,500<br />
The way of nature.<br />
<br />
6<br />
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:43,140<br />
And the way of grace.<br />
<br />
7<br />
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:47,650<br />
You have to choose which one you'll follow.<br />
<br />
8<br />
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,390<br />
Grace doesn't try to please itself.<br />
<br />
9<br />
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:09,370<br />
It accepts being slighted, forgotten, disliked.<br />
<br />
10<br />
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:16,710<br />
It accepts insults and injuries.<br />
<br />
11<br />
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:37,730<br />
Nature only wants to please itself.<br />
<br />
12<br />
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:40,510<br />
Bless our lord this food...<br />
<br />
13<br />
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,570<br />
Get others to please it too.<br />
<br />
14<br />
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:44,300<br />
...loving and faithful service...<br />
<br />
15<br />
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:46,410<br />
It likes to lord it over them.<br />
<br />
16<br />
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:48,240<br />
...Bless these boys...<br />
<br />
17<br />
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:50,440<br />
To have its own way.<br />
<br />
18<br />
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:57,650<br />
It finds reasons to be unhappy.<br />
<br />
19<br />
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,720<br />
When all the world is shining around it.<br />
<br />
20<br />
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:05,130<br />
And love is smiling through all things.<br />
<br />
21<br />
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:23,870<br />
They taught us, that no one who loves the way of grace,<br />
<br />
22<br />
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:26,620<br />
ever comes to a bad end.<br />
<br />
23<br />
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:36,530<br />
I will be true to you,<br />
<br />
24<br />
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,560<br />
whatever comes.<br />
<br />
25<br />
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:03,040<br />
My son.<br />
<br />
26<br />
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:15,280<br />
I just want to die. To be with him.<br />
<br />
27<br />
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,090<br />
He's in God's hands now.<br />
<br />
28<br />
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:08,170<br />
He was in God's hands the whole time.<br />
<br />
29<br />
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:12,470<br />
Wasn't he?<br />
<br />
30<br />
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,550<br />
My home.<br />
<br />
31<br />
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:25,580<br />
My God.<br />
<br />
32<br />
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,220<br />
I shall fear no evil.<br />
<br />
33<br />
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:38,600<br />
Fear no evil, for you are with me.<br />
<br />
34<br />
00:07:38,770 --> 00:07:40,570<br />
What did you gain?<br />
<br />
35<br />
00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:43,540<br />
Be not far from me, for trouble is near.<br />
<br />
36<br />
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:45,470<br />
Go on now, we're alright.<br />
<br />
37<br />
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:49,440<br />
We're alright.<br />
<br />
38<br />
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,520<br />
Thank you.<br />
<br />
39<br />
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:08,700<br />
Shouldn't have your memories of him.<br />
<br />
40<br />
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:12,160<br />
You have to be strong now, and...<br />
<br />
41<br />
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:19,310<br />
I know, the pain will, it will pass in time.<br />
<br />
42<br />
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,140<br />
You know, it might seem,<br />
<br />
43<br />
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:24,710<br />
hard, my saying that, but it's true.<br />
<br />
44<br />
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,870<br />
I don't want it to.<br />
<br />
45<br />
00:08:29,290 --> 00:08:31,020<br />
Life goes on.<br />
<br />
46<br />
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:35,060<br />
People pass along.<br />
<br />
47<br />
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:38,690<br />
Nothing stays the same.<br />
<br />
48<br />
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,530<br />
You still got the other two.<br />
<br />
49<br />
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:54,440<br />
The Lord gives and the Lord takes away.<br />
<br />
50<br />
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,610<br />
That's the way he is.<br />
<br />
51<br />
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:08,320<br />
He sends flies to wounds...that he should heal.<br />
<br />
52<br />
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:29,410<br />
I never got a chance to tell him how sorry I was.<br />
<br />
53<br />
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:36,780<br />
I even...<br />
<br />
54<br />
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:42,590<br />
punched himself in the face for no reason.<br />
<br />
55<br />
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,070<br />
You sit next to me at the piano<br />
<br />
56<br />
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:54,730<br />
and I criticized where he'd turned the pages.<br />
<br />
57<br />
00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:15,180<br />
I might even feel ashamed.<br />
<br />
58<br />
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:18,450<br />
Why shame?<br />
<br />
59<br />
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,170<br />
Poor boy. Poor boy.<br />
<br />
60<br />
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,830<br />
How did you come to me?<br />
<br />
61<br />
00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:08,810<br />
In what shape?<br />
<br />
62<br />
00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:15,210<br />
What disguise?<br />
<br />
63<br />
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:41,400<br />
I see the child I was.<br />
<br />
64<br />
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:53,050<br />
I see my brother.<br />
<br />
65<br />
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:57,880<br />
True.<br />
<br />
66<br />
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:02,060<br />
Kind.<br />
<br />
67<br />
00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:11,400<br />
He died when he was 19.<br />
<br />
68<br />
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:47,130<br />
Just check, this one against this.<br />
<br />
69<br />
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:49,330<br />
She wants to get back together.<br />
<br />
70<br />
00:13:49,810 --> 00:13:52,570<br />
But, the chapter's closed, the story's been told.<br />
<br />
71<br />
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:56,010<br />
What are you gonna do?<br />
<br />
72<br />
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:58,970<br />
Experiment.<br />
<br />
73<br />
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,610<br />
When you're young, it's all about your career.<br />
<br />
74<br />
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:20,340<br />
I just feel like I'm...bumping into walls.<br />
<br />
75<br />
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,910<br />
The world's gone to the dogs,<br />
<br />
76<br />
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:41,390<br />
people are greedy and keep getting worse.<br />
<br />
77<br />
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:48,490<br />
I try to get into their hands.<br />
<br />
78<br />
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:00,800<br />
Hey dad, I'm sorry I said what I said, I'm...<br />
<br />
79<br />
00:15:06,850 --> 00:15:09,570<br />
Yeah, I think about him every day.<br />
<br />
80<br />
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:11,950<br />
I just shouldn't have said what I did, I'm sorry.<br />
<br />
81<br />
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:24,220<br />
What are you thinking? I know, I know what you did...<br />
<br />
82<br />
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:29,900<br />
And only two of those were turned down by client...<br />
<br />
83<br />
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,720<br />
How did I lose you?<br />
<br />
84<br />
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:01,930<br />
Wandered.<br />
<br />
85<br />
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:08,110<br />
Forgot you.<br />
<br />
86<br />
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:09,330<br />
Find me.<br />
<br />
87<br />
00:17:34,370 --> 00:17:36,330<br />
How did she bear it?<br />
<br />
88<br />
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:47,510<br />
Mother.<br />
<br />
89<br />
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:27,480<br />
Was I false to you?<br />
<br />
90<br />
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:16,000<br />
Lord...<br />
<br />
91<br />
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:24,610<br />
Why?<br />
<br />
92<br />
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:34,520<br />
Where were you?<br />
<br />
93<br />
00:20:36,150 --> 00:20:37,810<br />
Did you know?<br />
<br />
94<br />
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:56,430<br />
Who are we to you?<br />
<br />
95<br />
00:21:15,850 --> 00:21:17,380<br />
Answer me.<br />
<br />
96<br />
00:25:28,910 --> 00:25:30,970<br />
We cry to you.<br />
<br />
97<br />
00:25:37,310 --> 00:25:38,800<br />
My soul.<br />
<br />
98<br />
00:25:47,990 --> 00:25:49,580<br />
My son.<br />
<br />
99<br />
00:25:57,940 --> 00:25:59,660<br />
Hear us.<br />
<br />
100<br />
00:34:04,050 --> 00:34:06,080<br />
Light up my life.<br />
<br />
101<br />
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:11,360<br />
I search for you.<br />
<br />
102<br />
00:34:16,330 --> 00:34:17,460<br />
My home.<br />
<br />
103<br />
00:34:28,450 --> 00:34:29,940<br />
My child.<br />
<br />
104<br />
00:35:49,930 --> 00:35:52,120<br />
You spoke to me through her.<br />
<br />
105<br />
00:35:55,970 --> 00:35:58,370<br />
You spoke with me from the sky.<br />
<br />
106<br />
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:02,130<br />
The trees.<br />
<br />
107<br />
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:09,070<br />
Before I knew I loved you,<br />
<br />
108<br />
00:36:11,850 --> 00:36:13,540<br />
believed in you.<br />
<br />
109<br />
00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:35,070<br />
When did you first touch my heart?<br />
<br />
110<br />
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:11,340<br />
...and manfully to fight under<br />
<br />
111<br />
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:14,030<br />
his banner against sin, the world, and the devil.<br />
<br />
112<br />
00:39:55,370 --> 00:39:57,670<br />
We're having Mr. McMander over for dinner.<br />
<br />
113<br />
00:39:57,670 --> 00:39:59,640<br />
This is a double bidder right on in.<br />
<br />
114<br />
00:41:40,980 --> 00:41:42,770<br />
What's this?<br />
<br />
115<br />
00:41:42,980 --> 00:41:45,810<br />
- Two alligators. - Two alligators.<br />
<br />
116<br />
00:41:51,450 --> 00:41:54,120<br />
- Kangaroo. - Kangaroo.<br />
<br />
117<br />
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:06,200<br />
Jump. Jump. Jump. Jump.<br />
<br />
118<br />
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:13,360<br />
Sweetheart.<br />
<br />
119<br />
00:43:16,110 --> 00:43:17,400<br />
Please.<br />
<br />
120<br />
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:21,240<br />
I know.<br />
<br />
121<br />
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:23,470<br />
No! No!<br />
<br />
122<br />
00:43:48,780 --> 00:43:50,680<br />
It's mine!<br />
<br />
123<br />
00:43:54,380 --> 00:43:56,110<br />
You found me!<br />
<br />
124<br />
00:44:32,150 --> 00:44:35,140<br />
You'll be grown before that tree is tall.<br />
<br />
125<br />
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:42,020<br />
Blue far.<br />
<br />
126<br />
00:44:44,530 --> 00:44:45,620<br />
You.<br />
<br />
127<br />
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:00,600<br />
Are you afraid?<br />
<br />
128<br />
00:45:02,750 --> 00:45:04,010<br />
Come here.<br />
<br />
129<br />
00:45:57,700 --> 00:45:59,700<br />
Come here. Alright, now come back here son,<br />
<br />
130<br />
00:45:59,700 --> 00:46:01,900<br />
stay out of there. That's Spencer's yard, okay?<br />
<br />
131<br />
00:46:02,610 --> 00:46:04,160<br />
You see this line?<br />
<br />
132<br />
00:46:04,540 --> 00:46:06,470<br />
Let's not cross it, you understand?<br />
<br />
133<br />
00:46:07,580 --> 00:46:08,940<br />
Do you understand?<br />
<br />
134<br />
00:46:10,010 --> 00:46:11,980<br />
Do you see this line? Look it here. Look here.<br />
<br />
135<br />
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:17,350<br />
Okay, now come back here son. Come on back.<br />
<br />
136<br />
00:46:24,630 --> 00:46:26,320<br />
Let's stay out of there.<br />
<br />
137<br />
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:45,850<br />
"Now, my dears," said old Mrs. Rabbit one morning,<br />
<br />
138<br />
00:46:46,380 --> 00:46:49,350<br />
"You may go into the fields or down the lane."<br />
<br />
139<br />
00:46:49,890 --> 00:46:52,550<br />
"Don't go into Mr. Mcgregor's garden."<br />
<br />
140<br />
00:46:53,320 --> 00:46:55,480<br />
"Your father had an accident there."<br />
<br />
141<br />
00:47:01,330 --> 00:47:03,760<br />
That's where God lives.<br />
<br />
142<br />
00:47:31,590 --> 00:47:35,460<br />
Goodnight, we'll see you in 5 years.<br />
<br />
143<br />
00:48:32,080 --> 00:48:33,580<br />
Want to eat a grasshopper?<br />
<br />
144<br />
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:36,350<br />
I found it! I found this old bone!<br />
<br />
145<br />
00:48:37,900 --> 00:48:39,690<br />
Oh, is that a rock?<br />
<br />
146<br />
00:48:39,690 --> 00:48:41,020<br />
No.<br />
<br />
147<br />
00:49:48,930 --> 00:49:51,560<br />
Bless this food to our use.<br />
<br />
148<br />
00:49:51,570 --> 00:49:54,290<br />
As to your loving and faithful service.<br />
<br />
149<br />
00:49:54,470 --> 00:49:57,100<br />
Make us remindful of those who are in need.<br />
<br />
150<br />
00:49:57,470 --> 00:49:58,440<br />
Amen.<br />
<br />
151<br />
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:08,480<br />
Can you pass the butter, please?<br />
<br />
152<br />
00:50:09,390 --> 00:50:11,410<br />
Can you pass the butter please sir.<br />
<br />
153<br />
00:50:11,550 --> 00:50:12,750<br />
Sir.<br />
<br />
154<br />
00:50:13,990 --> 00:50:17,520<br />
- What did you do today? - We went to school.<br />
<br />
155<br />
00:50:18,060 --> 00:50:19,790<br />
After that.<br />
<br />
156<br />
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:22,190<br />
What about the yard?<br />
<br />
157<br />
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:24,590<br />
Did you put the runners in like I asked?<br />
<br />
158<br />
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:27,360<br />
Yes.<br />
<br />
159<br />
00:50:28,170 --> 00:50:29,600<br />
Yes, sir.<br />
<br />
160<br />
00:50:31,070 --> 00:50:32,630<br />
Well, it didn't look like it.<br />
<br />
161<br />
00:50:49,530 --> 00:50:50,620<br />
Yes.<br />
<br />
162<br />
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:06,080<br />
Mr. Reese liked Jack's book report.<br />
<br />
163<br />
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:08,740<br />
Nobody's asked sweetheart.<br />
<br />
164<br />
00:51:09,710 --> 00:51:11,200<br />
You know this.<br />
<br />
165<br />
00:51:21,630 --> 00:51:22,760<br />
Crowns!<br />
<br />
166<br />
00:51:35,100 --> 00:51:37,200<br />
- Son. - Sir.<br />
<br />
167<br />
00:51:39,240 --> 00:51:41,300<br />
Reach me my lighter.<br />
<br />
168<br />
00:51:48,850 --> 00:51:51,080<br />
Haven't you forgotten something?<br />
<br />
169<br />
00:52:15,980 --> 00:52:17,540<br />
Do you love your father?<br />
<br />
170<br />
00:52:19,150 --> 00:52:20,380<br />
Yes, sir.<br />
<br />
171<br />
00:52:25,330 --> 00:52:28,880<br />
...and they went off to look for Kaa the Rock Python.<br />
<br />
172<br />
00:52:31,790 --> 00:52:33,000<br />
They found him stretched out<br />
<br />
173<br />
00:52:33,010 --> 00:52:35,090<br />
on a warm ledge in the afternoon sun,<br />
<br />
174<br />
00:52:36,500 --> 00:52:38,870<br />
admiring his beautiful new coat.<br />
<br />
175<br />
00:52:48,710 --> 00:52:50,740<br />
Who do you love most?<br />
<br />
176<br />
00:52:56,550 --> 00:52:58,650<br />
I love you all three the same.<br />
<br />
177<br />
00:53:00,290 --> 00:53:03,660<br />
Tell us a story from before we can remember.<br />
<br />
178<br />
00:53:07,360 --> 00:53:09,800<br />
He went for a ride in a plane once.<br />
<br />
179<br />
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:14,900<br />
It was a graduation present.<br />
<br />
180<br />
00:53:30,650 --> 00:53:31,710<br />
Mother...<br />
<br />
181<br />
00:53:41,030 --> 00:53:42,460<br />
Am I any good?<br />
<br />
182<br />
00:53:50,470 --> 00:53:51,840<br />
Brave.<br />
<br />
183<br />
00:56:51,320 --> 00:56:53,150<br />
Can it happen to anyone?<br />
<br />
184<br />
00:57:00,300 --> 00:57:02,130<br />
Nobody talks about it.<br />
<br />
185<br />
00:57:06,940 --> 00:57:09,430<br />
Help me not to sass my dad.<br />
<br />
186<br />
00:57:11,180 --> 00:57:14,750<br />
Help me not to get dogs in fights.<br />
<br />
187<br />
00:57:28,580 --> 00:57:31,580<br />
Help me be thankful for everything I've got.<br />
<br />
188<br />
00:57:33,630 --> 00:57:35,600<br />
Where do you live?<br />
<br />
189<br />
00:57:37,030 --> 00:57:39,520<br />
Help me not to tell lies.<br />
<br />
190<br />
00:57:46,280 --> 00:57:48,270<br />
Are you watching me?<br />
<br />
191<br />
00:57:58,750 --> 00:58:00,810<br />
I want to know what you are.<br />
<br />
192<br />
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:09,760<br />
I want to see what you see.<br />
<br />
193<br />
00:59:06,090 --> 00:59:07,420<br />
Come here.<br />
<br />
194<br />
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:19,790<br />
You're going to stand there and<br />
<br />
195<br />
00:59:19,790 --> 00:59:22,030<br />
you're going to close this door quietly, 50 times.<br />
<br />
196<br />
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:24,340<br />
Count it out.<br />
<br />
197<br />
00:59:34,550 --> 00:59:36,400<br />
You can't just take off the top.<br />
<br />
198<br />
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:38,320<br />
You got to get them by the roots.<br />
<br />
199<br />
00:59:46,560 --> 00:59:48,050<br />
Your mother's naive.<br />
<br />
200<br />
00:59:48,230 --> 00:59:50,560<br />
It takes fierce will to get ahead in this world.<br />
<br />
201<br />
00:59:52,730 --> 00:59:55,260<br />
If you're good, people take advantage of you.<br />
<br />
202<br />
01:00:01,680 --> 01:00:03,290<br />
Every one of these top executives,<br />
<br />
203<br />
01:00:03,290 --> 01:00:05,040<br />
you know how they got where they are?<br />
<br />
204<br />
01:00:05,250 --> 01:00:07,510<br />
Floated right down the middle of the river.<br />
<br />
205<br />
01:00:10,050 --> 01:00:13,220<br />
Don't let anyone tell you there's anything you can't do.<br />
<br />
206<br />
01:00:15,360 --> 01:00:18,260<br />
Don't do like I did, promise me that.<br />
<br />
207<br />
01:00:20,600 --> 01:00:22,760<br />
Dreamed of being a great musician.<br />
<br />
208<br />
01:00:23,430 --> 01:00:25,800<br />
I let myself get sidetracked.<br />
<br />
209<br />
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,380<br />
If you're looking for something to happen, that was it.<br />
<br />
210<br />
01:00:29,380 --> 01:00:31,090<br />
Life, lived it.<br />
<br />
211<br />
01:00:48,290 --> 01:00:51,590<br />
Job imagined he might build his nest on high.<br />
<br />
212<br />
01:00:52,630 --> 01:00:54,160<br />
That the integrity of his behavior<br />
<br />
213<br />
01:00:54,170 --> 01:00:57,000<br />
would protect him against misfortune.<br />
<br />
214<br />
01:00:57,370 --> 01:01:00,390<br />
And his friends thought mistakenly<br />
<br />
215<br />
01:01:00,540 --> 01:01:02,170<br />
that the Lord could only have punished<br />
<br />
216<br />
01:01:02,170 --> 01:01:04,270<br />
him because secretly he had done something wrong.<br />
<br />
217<br />
01:01:05,940 --> 01:01:07,170<br />
But no.<br />
<br />
218<br />
01:01:07,480 --> 01:01:09,500<br />
Misfortune befalls the good as well.<br />
<br />
219<br />
01:01:11,150 --> 01:01:13,480<br />
We can't protect ourselves against it.<br />
<br />
220<br />
01:01:13,680 --> 01:01:15,670<br />
We can't protect our children.<br />
<br />
221<br />
01:01:15,850 --> 01:01:18,720<br />
We can't say to ourselves, even if I'm not happy,<br />
<br />
222<br />
01:01:18,890 --> 01:01:21,750<br />
I'm going to make sure they are.<br />
<br />
223<br />
01:01:21,990 --> 01:01:23,550<br />
We run before the wind,<br />
<br />
224<br />
01:01:23,550 --> 01:01:25,890<br />
we think that it will carry us forever.<br />
<br />
225<br />
01:01:26,730 --> 01:01:28,200<br />
It will not.<br />
<br />
226<br />
01:01:28,360 --> 01:01:30,300<br />
We vanish as a cloud,<br />
<br />
227<br />
01:01:30,300 --> 01:01:32,490<br />
we whither as the autumn grass.<br />
<br />
228<br />
01:01:32,630 --> 01:01:35,230<br />
And like a tree, are rooted up.<br />
<br />
229<br />
01:01:37,970 --> 01:01:41,200<br />
Is there some fraud in the scheme of the universe?<br />
<br />
230<br />
01:01:41,340 --> 01:01:43,640<br />
Is there nothing which is deathless?<br />
<br />
231<br />
01:01:43,780 --> 01:01:46,610<br />
Nothing, which does not pass away?<br />
<br />
232<br />
01:01:48,780 --> 01:01:51,150<br />
We cannot stay where we are.<br />
<br />
233<br />
01:01:51,320 --> 01:01:53,410<br />
We must journey forth.<br />
<br />
234<br />
01:01:53,590 --> 01:01:57,320<br />
We must find that which is greater than fortune or fate.<br />
<br />
235<br />
01:01:58,890 --> 01:02:01,800<br />
Nothing can bring us peace, but that.<br />
<br />
236<br />
01:02:03,230 --> 01:02:07,400<br />
Is the body of the wise man or the just, exempt from any pain?<br />
<br />
237<br />
01:02:08,640 --> 01:02:10,680<br />
From any disquietude, from the deformity<br />
<br />
238<br />
01:02:10,680 --> 01:02:14,290<br />
that might blight its beauty from the weakness,<br />
<br />
239<br />
01:02:14,290 --> 01:02:17,000<br />
that might destroy its health.<br />
<br />
240<br />
01:02:18,810 --> 01:02:20,480<br />
Do you trust in God?<br />
<br />
241<br />
01:02:20,480 --> 01:02:24,110<br />
Job too, was close to the Lord.<br />
<br />
242<br />
01:02:25,490 --> 01:02:28,510<br />
Are your friends and children, your security?<br />
<br />
243<br />
01:02:29,990 --> 01:02:31,530<br />
There is no hiding place<br />
<br />
244<br />
01:02:31,540 --> 01:02:34,120<br />
in all the world where trouble may not find you.<br />
<br />
245<br />
01:02:34,430 --> 01:02:36,760<br />
No one knows when sorrow might visit his house,<br />
<br />
246<br />
01:02:36,760 --> 01:02:39,090<br />
any more than Job did.<br />
<br />
247<br />
01:02:40,500 --> 01:02:43,060<br />
At the very moment everything was taken away from Job.<br />
<br />
248<br />
01:02:43,210 --> 01:02:46,610<br />
He knew it was the Lord who had taken it away<br />
<br />
249<br />
01:02:49,180 --> 01:02:51,180<br />
Return from the passing shows of time<br />
<br />
250<br />
01:02:51,190 --> 01:02:54,870<br />
he thought that which is eternal.<br />
<br />
251<br />
01:02:56,080 --> 01:02:57,570<br />
As he alone see God's hand,<br />
<br />
252<br />
01:02:57,570 --> 01:02:59,250<br />
who sees that he gives.<br />
<br />
253<br />
01:03:00,590 --> 01:03:03,680<br />
Or does not also the one see God's hand,<br />
<br />
254<br />
01:03:03,680 --> 01:03:05,850<br />
who sees that he takes away.<br />
<br />
255<br />
01:03:07,130 --> 01:03:09,280<br />
Or does he alone see God,<br />
<br />
256<br />
01:03:09,280 --> 01:03:12,360<br />
who sees God turn his face towards him?<br />
<br />
257<br />
01:03:13,640 --> 01:03:15,670<br />
Does not also he see God,<br />
<br />
258<br />
01:03:15,670 --> 01:03:18,470<br />
who sees God turn his back.<br />
<br />
259<br />
01:03:18,640 --> 01:03:20,110<br />
He's a friend of mine.<br />
<br />
260<br />
01:03:20,240 --> 01:03:21,970<br />
The one who's after real estate in town.<br />
<br />
261<br />
01:03:23,450 --> 01:03:25,110<br />
Frank Johnson.<br />
<br />
262<br />
01:03:26,150 --> 01:03:28,140<br />
Started out as a barber.<br />
<br />
263<br />
01:03:29,890 --> 01:03:32,150<br />
He built something, big.<br />
<br />
264<br />
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:36,860<br />
Now you'd think he was the fourth person of the Holy Trinity.<br />
<br />
265<br />
01:03:39,190 --> 01:03:41,190<br />
They never talk about their money.<br />
<br />
266<br />
01:03:44,730 --> 01:03:46,790<br />
Wrong people go hungry.<br />
<br />
267<br />
01:03:48,140 --> 01:03:49,730<br />
Die.<br />
<br />
268<br />
01:03:51,940 --> 01:03:53,740<br />
Wrong people get loved.<br />
<br />
269<br />
01:03:56,780 --> 01:03:58,840<br />
The world lives by a trigger.<br />
<br />
270<br />
01:04:01,580 --> 01:04:04,380<br />
You want to succeed? You can't be too good.<br />
<br />
271<br />
01:04:12,090 --> 01:04:14,930<br />
Hey there young fella, try my cornbread.<br />
<br />
272<br />
01:04:16,130 --> 01:04:18,190<br />
Do y'all want some butter, do you?<br />
<br />
273<br />
01:04:20,200 --> 01:04:22,140<br />
How about a pound of bread?<br />
<br />
274<br />
01:04:49,500 --> 01:04:52,790<br />
You'll like this right? Okay? Come on.<br />
<br />
275<br />
01:04:53,030 --> 01:04:53,970<br />
Act like you're in trouble,<br />
<br />
276<br />
01:04:53,970 --> 01:04:55,800<br />
you don't want to fight, you don't want any trouble.<br />
<br />
277<br />
01:04:55,940 --> 01:04:57,960<br />
The minute you see him blink, crack him!<br />
<br />
278<br />
01:04:58,110 --> 01:04:59,330<br />
Okay?<br />
<br />
279<br />
01:04:59,510 --> 01:05:00,790<br />
Okay, come on, three quarters.<br />
<br />
280<br />
01:05:00,790 --> 01:05:02,340<br />
Cover, you're going to cover, right?<br />
<br />
281<br />
01:05:02,510 --> 01:05:04,850<br />
Okay, here. Come on, nice, harder, nice.<br />
<br />
282<br />
01:05:04,850 --> 01:05:06,910<br />
That's a good right, let's see your left.<br />
<br />
283<br />
01:05:07,550 --> 01:05:09,430<br />
This is the most important thing.<br />
<br />
284<br />
01:05:09,430 --> 01:05:12,110<br />
Okay? You come in this way, keep your guard up.<br />
<br />
285<br />
01:05:13,050 --> 01:05:15,350<br />
Hit me, come on, hit me. Come on, Jack? Hit me.<br />
<br />
286<br />
01:05:15,490 --> 01:05:17,220<br />
Hit me, come on, come on!<br />
<br />
287<br />
01:05:17,360 --> 01:05:19,220<br />
Okay, here it is, hit me!<br />
<br />
288<br />
01:05:19,360 --> 01:05:20,690<br />
Come on, son, come on!<br />
<br />
289<br />
01:05:20,860 --> 01:05:23,020<br />
What are you doing?<br />
<br />
290<br />
01:05:26,570 --> 01:05:28,800<br />
Wipe yourself off.<br />
<br />
291<br />
01:05:29,970 --> 01:05:32,960<br />
Left! Don't leave your tongue out, you're going to lose it!<br />
<br />
292<br />
01:05:33,110 --> 01:05:36,600<br />
Left. Left. Right. Right.<br />
<br />
293<br />
01:05:37,480 --> 01:05:39,040<br />
Left, harder.<br />
<br />
294<br />
01:05:39,210 --> 01:05:41,770<br />
Harder. Harder!<br />
<br />
295<br />
01:05:42,380 --> 01:05:44,940<br />
Hit me, hit me. Come on, son, hit.<br />
<br />
296<br />
01:05:45,090 --> 01:05:47,550<br />
Give me something, show me what you got.<br />
<br />
297<br />
01:05:49,120 --> 01:05:50,990<br />
Come on, go on.<br />
<br />
298<br />
01:05:57,430 --> 01:05:58,800<br />
One meal.<br />
<br />
299<br />
01:06:14,320 --> 01:06:16,010<br />
Leave the table.<br />
<br />
300<br />
01:06:22,220 --> 01:06:23,690<br />
You too?<br />
<br />
301<br />
01:06:25,630 --> 01:06:27,720<br />
- You going to continue to defy me? - No, sir.<br />
<br />
302<br />
01:06:27,900 --> 01:06:30,590<br />
You're interrupting me, I wasn't done yet.<br />
<br />
303<br />
01:06:33,770 --> 01:06:35,540<br />
Am I finished?<br />
<br />
304<br />
01:06:36,500 --> 01:06:39,810<br />
- Am I? - No.<br />
<br />
305<br />
01:06:39,810 --> 01:06:41,900<br />
Thank you, Your Majesty.<br />
<br />
306<br />
01:07:38,430 --> 01:07:40,130<br />
Makes up stories.<br />
<br />
307<br />
01:07:43,610 --> 01:07:45,660<br />
Fortunate words.<br />
<br />
308<br />
01:07:53,980 --> 01:07:57,040<br />
He says don't put your elbows on the table.<br />
<br />
309<br />
01:07:58,420 --> 01:07:59,910<br />
He does.<br />
<br />
310<br />
01:08:03,860 --> 01:08:06,120<br />
Insults people.<br />
<br />
311<br />
01:08:07,600 --> 01:08:09,190<br />
Doesn't care.<br />
<br />
312<br />
01:08:09,630 --> 01:08:11,060<br />
I remember when you were born.<br />
<br />
313<br />
01:08:16,700 --> 01:08:18,190<br />
They wouldn't let me come home.<br />
<br />
314<br />
01:08:20,210 --> 01:08:25,080<br />
Navy said an officer must be present for the laying of the cue.<br />
<br />
315<br />
01:08:26,310 --> 01:08:27,980<br />
I had to launch.<br />
<br />
316<br />
01:09:12,030 --> 01:09:13,820<br />
The next word is volcano.<br />
<br />
317<br />
01:09:24,570 --> 01:09:26,670<br />
Next word is socket.<br />
<br />
318<br />
01:09:32,980 --> 01:09:34,690<br />
Please pass your answers to each other.<br />
<br />
319<br />
01:09:34,690 --> 01:09:36,680<br />
We're going to grade each others' papers now.<br />
<br />
320<br />
01:09:42,990 --> 01:09:44,620<br />
No interruptions, please.<br />
<br />
321<br />
01:09:46,430 --> 01:09:49,830<br />
Come on, get your pencil out.<br />
<br />
322<br />
01:11:09,810 --> 01:11:12,010<br />
Sweetheart! Oh God, sweetheart!<br />
<br />
323<br />
01:11:13,380 --> 01:11:14,810<br />
Honey!<br />
<br />
324<br />
01:12:44,240 --> 01:12:45,830<br />
Was it bad?<br />
<br />
325<br />
01:12:55,380 --> 01:12:58,010<br />
Will you die too?<br />
<br />
326<br />
01:13:00,390 --> 01:13:02,450<br />
You're not that old yet, mom.<br />
<br />
327<br />
01:13:20,810 --> 01:13:22,500<br />
Where were you?<br />
<br />
328<br />
01:13:34,790 --> 01:13:36,480<br />
You had a boy die.<br />
<br />
329<br />
01:13:44,100 --> 01:13:46,190<br />
Would anything happen?<br />
<br />
330<br />
01:13:59,250 --> 01:14:02,080<br />
I can't see! I can't see!<br />
<br />
331<br />
01:14:06,990 --> 01:14:09,220<br />
Why should I be good?<br />
<br />
332<br />
01:14:12,390 --> 01:14:14,260<br />
If you aren't.<br />
<br />
333<br />
01:15:03,880 --> 01:15:05,370<br />
Thank you.<br />
<br />
334<br />
01:15:20,490 --> 01:15:22,890<br />
We're close.<br />
<br />
335<br />
01:15:25,070 --> 01:15:26,830<br />
Why's this bare here?<br />
<br />
336<br />
01:15:27,670 --> 01:15:29,600<br />
The grass won't grow under the tree.<br />
<br />
337<br />
01:15:29,600 --> 01:15:32,560<br />
- It does at Kimbles. - They have a gardener.<br />
<br />
338<br />
01:15:32,910 --> 01:15:34,400<br />
They have money.<br />
<br />
339<br />
01:15:34,780 --> 01:15:36,770<br />
Of course he inherited it.<br />
<br />
340<br />
01:15:38,310 --> 01:15:41,060<br />
I don't want to hear one more word out of you,<br />
<br />
341<br />
01:15:41,060 --> 01:15:42,680<br />
not until this is finished.<br />
<br />
342<br />
01:16:22,590 --> 01:16:24,320<br />
You're cropping that too close.<br />
<br />
343<br />
01:16:24,730 --> 01:16:26,890<br />
You're going to have to keep that water.<br />
<br />
344<br />
01:16:53,690 --> 01:16:54,990<br />
Toskanini.<br />
<br />
345<br />
01:16:55,690 --> 01:16:57,160<br />
Once recorded a piece 65 times.<br />
<br />
346<br />
01:16:57,160 --> 01:16:59,020<br />
You know what he said when he finished?<br />
<br />
347<br />
01:17:00,090 --> 01:17:01,990<br />
It could be better.<br />
<br />
348<br />
01:17:04,070 --> 01:17:05,500<br />
Think about it.<br />
<br />
349<br />
01:17:07,870 --> 01:17:10,960<br />
27 patents, your father has.<br />
<br />
350<br />
01:17:12,340 --> 01:17:14,930<br />
It means ownership, ownership of ideas.<br />
<br />
351<br />
01:17:16,480 --> 01:17:17,760<br />
You gotta sew them up.<br />
<br />
352<br />
01:17:17,760 --> 01:17:20,380<br />
- Get them by the nuts. - If you pardon my French.<br />
<br />
353<br />
01:17:22,450 --> 01:17:24,040<br />
Be rich.<br />
<br />
354<br />
01:17:26,490 --> 01:17:28,720<br />
You make yourself what you are.<br />
<br />
355<br />
01:17:32,660 --> 01:17:34,390<br />
You have control of your own destiny.<br />
<br />
356<br />
01:17:38,230 --> 01:17:39,890<br />
Can't say I can't.<br />
<br />
357<br />
01:17:41,470 --> 01:17:43,370<br />
You see I'm having trouble.<br />
<br />
358<br />
01:17:44,740 --> 01:17:46,810<br />
I'm not done yet.<br />
<br />
359<br />
01:17:46,810 --> 01:17:49,300<br />
Can't say I can't.<br />
<br />
360<br />
01:18:24,650 --> 01:18:26,640<br />
Why's he hurt us?<br />
<br />
361<br />
01:18:28,950 --> 01:18:31,010<br />
Our father?<br />
<br />
362<br />
01:18:37,020 --> 01:18:40,550<br />
- Come on, Vince! Come on. - Get it, get it!<br />
<br />
363<br />
01:18:54,610 --> 01:18:56,510<br />
Give your father a kiss.<br />
<br />
364<br />
01:19:36,250 --> 01:19:39,190<br />
Lies.<br />
<br />
365<br />
01:19:41,160 --> 01:19:42,850<br />
- I can't. - Will you do something for me?<br />
<br />
366<br />
01:19:43,290 --> 01:19:44,350<br />
Do you promise you'll do it?<br />
<br />
367<br />
01:19:44,690 --> 01:19:46,010<br />
Without having to ask what it is?<br />
<br />
368<br />
01:19:46,010 --> 01:19:48,130<br />
Just have the confidence in what your father asks of you is right?<br />
<br />
369<br />
01:19:48,460 --> 01:19:49,860<br />
Yes, sir.<br />
<br />
370<br />
01:19:50,400 --> 01:19:51,760<br />
In the next half hour, will you<br />
<br />
371<br />
01:19:51,760 --> 01:19:54,090<br />
not speak unless you have something important to say?<br />
<br />
372<br />
01:20:00,770 --> 01:20:02,740<br />
What did you do today, my fine feathered friend?<br />
<br />
373<br />
01:20:05,210 --> 01:20:06,940<br />
Sit on the front of your chair.<br />
<br />
374<br />
01:20:07,520 --> 01:20:10,680<br />
It's better for your posture. I read that in the paper.<br />
<br />
375<br />
01:20:14,560 --> 01:20:16,920<br />
Did you actually buy this from Mr. Ledbetter?<br />
<br />
376<br />
01:20:18,030 --> 01:20:20,260<br />
Don't explain, just nod, yes or no?<br />
<br />
377<br />
01:20:26,470 --> 01:20:28,490<br />
Be quiet.<br />
<br />
378<br />
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:31,870<br />
What did you say?<br />
<br />
379<br />
01:20:35,140 --> 01:20:36,400<br />
Please.<br />
<br />
380<br />
01:20:37,080 --> 01:20:38,140<br />
Leave him alone.<br />
<br />
381<br />
01:20:42,020 --> 01:20:43,380<br />
Leave him alone!<br />
<br />
382<br />
01:20:47,820 --> 01:20:49,690<br />
Come here! Come here!<br />
<br />
383<br />
01:20:54,530 --> 01:20:55,930<br />
Get up there!<br />
<br />
384<br />
01:21:52,690 --> 01:21:54,480<br />
You turn my own kids against me.<br />
<br />
385<br />
01:21:56,160 --> 01:21:58,180<br />
You undermine everything I do.<br />
<br />
386<br />
01:22:07,770 --> 01:22:09,530<br />
How do you like it?<br />
<br />
387<br />
01:22:11,370 --> 01:22:12,500<br />
Stop it!<br />
<br />
388<br />
01:22:13,540 --> 01:22:19,970<br />
Stop.<br />
<br />
389<br />
01:22:31,090 --> 01:22:32,460<br />
Stop.<br />
<br />
390<br />
01:24:30,710 --> 01:24:34,110<br />
- Where's Dad? - He's gone on a trip.<br />
<br />
391<br />
01:25:17,160 --> 01:25:19,720<br />
Get her! Get her!<br />
<br />
392<br />
01:25:19,890 --> 01:25:21,790<br />
Help each other.<br />
<br />
393<br />
01:25:24,060 --> 01:25:26,690<br />
Do not slam that screen door!<br />
<br />
394<br />
01:25:27,770 --> 01:25:29,700<br />
Love everyone.<br />
<br />
395<br />
01:25:32,510 --> 01:25:34,060<br />
Every leaf.<br />
<br />
396<br />
01:25:35,840 --> 01:25:38,000<br />
Every ray of light.<br />
<br />
397<br />
01:25:45,750 --> 01:25:48,350<br />
Our gift.<br />
<br />
398<br />
01:26:27,630 --> 01:26:28,860<br />
Shut up!<br />
<br />
399<br />
01:27:26,490 --> 01:27:28,320<br />
- Watch out! - Watch out!<br />
<br />
400<br />
01:27:28,340 --> 01:27:29,180<br />
- Go. - Go!<br />
<br />
401<br />
01:27:47,810 --> 01:27:49,330<br />
I say let's bust them.<br />
<br />
402<br />
01:28:15,840 --> 01:28:17,960<br />
Found a frog!<br />
<br />
403<br />
01:28:18,670 --> 01:28:20,140<br />
Lets go set it off in a sky rocket!<br />
<br />
404<br />
01:28:20,510 --> 01:28:21,970<br />
He's getting away!<br />
<br />
405<br />
01:28:24,340 --> 01:28:25,830<br />
Get back! Get back!<br />
<br />
406<br />
01:28:33,120 --> 01:28:34,820<br />
Did he go to the moon?<br />
<br />
407<br />
01:28:37,920 --> 01:28:42,490<br />
- Where is he? - Here he is.<br />
<br />
408<br />
01:28:43,760 --> 01:28:45,530<br />
It was an experiment!<br />
<br />
409<br />
01:28:49,540 --> 01:28:50,760<br />
Why?<br />
<br />
410<br />
01:28:52,710 --> 01:28:54,730<br />
Never do it again.<br />
<br />
411<br />
01:28:55,540 --> 01:28:57,270<br />
Promise?<br />
<br />
412<br />
01:29:00,280 --> 01:29:02,310<br />
You want to tell dad?<br />
<br />
413<br />
01:29:03,450 --> 01:29:06,780<br />
They're just trying to scare you.<br />
<br />
414<br />
01:29:08,790 --> 01:29:10,480<br />
Keep your ear there.<br />
<br />
415<br />
01:29:15,060 --> 01:29:16,960<br />
Things she got to learn.<br />
<br />
416<br />
01:29:20,470 --> 01:29:23,490<br />
I gotta know stuff too.<br />
<br />
417<br />
01:29:40,550 --> 01:29:44,460<br />
They say you can't try stuff? They do!<br />
<br />
418<br />
01:29:49,030 --> 01:29:51,020<br />
What do you need be afraid of?<br />
<br />
419<br />
01:29:54,230 --> 01:29:57,860<br />
You're afraid. I see it.<br />
<br />
420<br />
01:29:58,640 --> 01:30:00,660<br />
Right here! Right here!<br />
<br />
421<br />
01:35:26,130 --> 01:35:27,930<br />
I can't talk to you.<br />
<br />
422<br />
01:35:37,140 --> 01:35:38,840<br />
Don't look at me.<br />
<br />
423<br />
01:36:27,330 --> 01:36:29,420<br />
Au revoir, story.<br />
<br />
424<br />
01:36:33,370 --> 01:36:36,820<br />
Au revoir, dawn.<br />
<br />
425<br />
01:37:05,330 --> 01:37:06,760<br />
Put it in there.<br />
<br />
426<br />
01:37:46,210 --> 01:37:47,800<br />
I trust you.<br />
<br />
427<br />
01:38:04,020 --> 01:38:07,460<br />
- You tired? - No. I never get tired.<br />
<br />
428<br />
01:38:08,460 --> 01:38:11,260<br />
- You did this morning. - No, I was just pretending.<br />
<br />
429<br />
01:38:11,830 --> 01:38:13,730<br />
- You call me a liar? - No.<br />
<br />
430<br />
01:38:14,230 --> 01:38:17,930<br />
- I don't want to fight. - Afraid to?<br />
<br />
431<br />
01:38:18,500 --> 01:38:20,340<br />
No, I just don't want to.<br />
<br />
432<br />
01:38:21,770 --> 01:38:25,270<br />
- If I was to say you're scared, would you call me a liar? - No.<br />
<br />
433<br />
01:38:27,080 --> 01:38:30,110<br />
You're scared, aren't you?<br />
<br />
434<br />
01:38:40,390 --> 01:38:41,830<br />
Quit it.<br />
<br />
435<br />
01:39:30,080 --> 01:39:31,410<br />
Come here!<br />
<br />
436<br />
01:39:33,580 --> 01:39:35,580<br />
No!<br />
<br />
437<br />
01:39:38,950 --> 01:39:40,890<br />
I don't want to do anything you tell me to.<br />
<br />
438<br />
01:39:42,290 --> 01:39:44,450<br />
I want to do what I want.<br />
<br />
439<br />
01:39:48,590 --> 01:39:51,120<br />
What do you know? You let him run all over you.<br />
<br />
440<br />
01:40:41,750 --> 01:40:43,880<br />
How do I get back?<br />
<br />
441<br />
01:40:49,360 --> 01:40:51,220<br />
Where they are?<br />
<br />
442<br />
01:41:25,830 --> 01:41:27,880<br />
This one is heavy, you're going to need two hands.<br />
<br />
443<br />
01:41:38,270 --> 01:41:41,260<br />
- Careful now, you know what's that? - Chinese?<br />
<br />
444<br />
01:41:42,010 --> 01:41:44,000<br />
That's Chinese, that's very good, yes, it is.<br />
<br />
445<br />
01:41:45,410 --> 01:41:48,350<br />
Your father went all around the world. All the way to China.<br />
<br />
446<br />
01:41:49,180 --> 01:41:50,360<br />
That's Pan Am Airlines,<br />
<br />
447<br />
01:41:50,370 --> 01:41:52,480<br />
that's what your father flew on.<br />
<br />
448<br />
01:41:52,920 --> 01:41:54,640<br />
The entire bathroom was stainless steel.<br />
<br />
449<br />
01:41:54,640 --> 01:41:56,360<br />
Even the wash basin.<br />
<br />
450<br />
01:41:56,720 --> 01:41:58,950<br />
I feel confident the deal is going through.<br />
<br />
451<br />
01:41:59,460 --> 01:42:01,220<br />
Nothing, forget it. I'll tell Molly to go to hell.<br />
<br />
452<br />
01:42:02,060 --> 01:42:04,660<br />
That's from Germany.<br />
<br />
453<br />
01:42:04,960 --> 01:42:06,120<br />
See that?<br />
<br />
454<br />
01:42:09,400 --> 01:42:11,130<br />
Put that down, son.<br />
<br />
455<br />
01:42:11,540 --> 01:42:12,800<br />
Can Taylor come over?<br />
<br />
456<br />
01:42:13,470 --> 01:42:15,240<br />
Was your family not good enough for you?<br />
<br />
457<br />
01:42:22,620 --> 01:42:25,520<br />
It's not going to take as long as last time?<br />
<br />
458<br />
01:42:25,990 --> 01:42:27,650<br />
Al dente.<br />
<br />
459<br />
01:42:30,720 --> 01:42:33,450<br />
It's a subjective point, you know the difference?<br />
<br />
460<br />
01:42:33,760 --> 01:42:35,280<br />
Subjective means it comes from your mind.<br />
<br />
461<br />
01:42:35,280 --> 01:42:36,590<br />
It can't be proven by other people.<br />
<br />
462<br />
01:42:44,940 --> 01:42:47,910<br />
It's good to see you again. Let's go, boys.<br />
<br />
463<br />
01:42:52,180 --> 01:42:53,840<br />
There are things you can't do.<br />
<br />
464<br />
01:42:54,180 --> 01:42:56,170<br />
But there are things I can't do either.<br />
<br />
465<br />
01:42:57,580 --> 01:42:59,950<br />
You're not to call me dad, you will call me father.<br />
<br />
466<br />
01:43:00,290 --> 01:43:01,550<br />
- But... - Do not interrupt!<br />
<br />
467<br />
01:43:01,920 --> 01:43:03,750<br />
- But you did... - Don't interrupt!<br />
<br />
468<br />
01:43:09,500 --> 01:43:10,720<br />
It's your house.<br />
<br />
469<br />
01:43:11,100 --> 01:43:13,500<br />
You can kick me out whenever you want to.<br />
<br />
470<br />
01:43:18,640 --> 01:43:21,200<br />
You'd like to kill me.<br />
<br />
471<br />
01:43:40,190 --> 01:43:41,520<br />
Dad.<br />
<br />
472<br />
01:43:46,470 --> 01:43:49,060<br />
Why was he born?<br />
<br />
473<br />
01:45:13,850 --> 01:45:15,480<br />
Please, God, kill him.<br />
<br />
474<br />
01:45:20,630 --> 01:45:22,030<br />
Let him die.<br />
<br />
475<br />
01:45:27,200 --> 01:45:29,130<br />
Get him out of here.<br />
<br />
476<br />
01:45:50,090 --> 01:45:52,820<br />
She only loves me!<br />
<br />
477<br />
01:46:04,080 --> 01:46:08,160<br />
Defend O'Lord this thy child with thy heavenly grace.<br />
<br />
478<br />
01:46:08,160 --> 01:46:10,780<br />
That he may continue thine forever.<br />
<br />
479<br />
01:46:11,510 --> 01:46:15,480<br />
And daily increase in thy Holy Spirit more and more<br />
<br />
480<br />
01:46:15,480 --> 01:46:20,680<br />
until he come unto thy everlasting kingdom, Amen.<br />
<br />
481<br />
01:47:02,060 --> 01:47:04,120<br />
See something...<br />
<br />
482<br />
01:47:54,650 --> 01:47:56,080<br />
Put your finger over it.<br />
<br />
483<br />
01:47:58,420 --> 01:47:59,710<br />
There.<br />
<br />
484<br />
01:48:01,220 --> 01:48:02,850<br />
Come on.<br />
<br />
485<br />
01:49:00,750 --> 01:49:03,270<br />
What I want to do I can't do.<br />
<br />
486<br />
01:49:08,850 --> 01:49:11,350<br />
I do what I hate.<br />
<br />
487<br />
01:50:12,280 --> 01:50:13,840<br />
You can hit me if you want.<br />
<br />
488<br />
01:50:32,100 --> 01:50:33,300<br />
I'm sorry.<br />
<br />
489<br />
01:50:36,640 --> 01:50:38,670<br />
You're my brother.<br />
<br />
490<br />
01:51:22,860 --> 01:51:25,090<br />
What was it you showed me?<br />
<br />
491<br />
01:51:33,570 --> 01:51:36,830<br />
I didn't know how to name you sin.<br />
<br />
492<br />
01:51:41,440 --> 01:51:44,340<br />
But I'll say it was you.<br />
<br />
493<br />
01:51:49,310 --> 01:51:52,110<br />
Always you were calling me.<br />
<br />
494<br />
01:53:40,830 --> 01:53:43,920<br />
I wanted to be loved because I was great.<br />
<br />
495<br />
01:53:46,800 --> 01:53:48,230<br />
A big man.<br />
<br />
496<br />
01:53:50,370 --> 01:53:52,560<br />
I am nothing.<br />
<br />
497<br />
01:53:56,980 --> 01:53:59,740<br />
Look, the glory around us.<br />
<br />
498<br />
01:54:03,150 --> 01:54:05,340<br />
Trees and birds.<br />
<br />
499<br />
01:54:08,650 --> 01:54:11,590<br />
I lived in shame.<br />
<br />
500<br />
01:54:14,160 --> 01:54:16,890<br />
I dishonored it all and didn't notice the glory.<br />
<br />
501<br />
01:54:23,640 --> 01:54:25,470<br />
A foolish man.<br />
<br />
502<br />
01:54:30,610 --> 01:54:32,130<br />
They're closing the plant.<br />
<br />
503<br />
01:54:35,950 --> 01:54:37,810<br />
They gave me a choice.<br />
<br />
504<br />
01:54:41,350 --> 01:54:42,680<br />
No job.<br />
<br />
505<br />
01:54:45,820 --> 01:54:49,160<br />
Or transfer to a job nobody wants.<br />
<br />
506<br />
01:54:58,400 --> 01:54:59,670<br />
Father.<br />
<br />
507<br />
01:55:02,710 --> 01:55:04,770<br />
I never missed a day of work.<br />
<br />
508<br />
01:55:05,610 --> 01:55:07,480<br />
Mother.<br />
<br />
509<br />
01:55:08,080 --> 01:55:10,510<br />
Tithe every Sunday.<br />
<br />
510<br />
01:55:13,950 --> 01:55:17,220<br />
Always you wrestle inside me.<br />
<br />
511<br />
01:55:21,730 --> 01:55:23,750<br />
Always you will.<br />
<br />
512<br />
01:55:25,100 --> 01:55:27,460<br />
You know, Jack, all I ever wanted for you was...<br />
<br />
513<br />
01:55:29,500 --> 01:55:34,230<br />
Make you strong and, grow up and be your own boss.<br />
<br />
514<br />
01:55:38,210 --> 01:55:39,940<br />
Maybe I've been tough on you.<br />
<br />
515<br />
01:55:42,410 --> 01:55:43,880<br />
I'm not proud of that.<br />
<br />
516<br />
01:55:45,850 --> 01:55:48,250<br />
I'm as bad as you are.<br />
<br />
517<br />
01:55:51,660 --> 01:55:53,650<br />
I'm more like you than her.<br />
<br />
518<br />
01:56:02,530 --> 01:56:06,740<br />
It was about all I've done in life, otherwise I've drawn zilch.<br />
<br />
519<br />
01:56:14,510 --> 01:56:17,580<br />
You're all I have, you're all I want to have.<br />
<br />
520<br />
01:56:24,990 --> 01:56:26,250<br />
My sweet boy.<br />
<br />
521<br />
01:58:32,950 --> 01:58:35,350<br />
Are you just going to stand there like a bump on a log?<br />
<br />
522<br />
01:59:47,830 --> 01:59:50,160<br />
The only way to be happy is to love.<br />
<br />
523<br />
01:59:54,830 --> 01:59:56,630<br />
Unless you love,<br />
<br />
524<br />
01:59:58,740 --> 02:00:00,930<br />
your life will flash by.<br />
<br />
525<br />
02:00:11,920 --> 02:00:13,540<br />
Do good to them.<br />
<br />
526<br />
02:00:18,620 --> 02:00:19,920<br />
Wonder.<br />
<br />
527<br />
02:00:24,660 --> 02:00:26,150<br />
Hope.<br />
<br />
528<br />
02:01:18,550 --> 02:01:20,020<br />
Brother.<br />
<br />
529<br />
02:02:09,500 --> 02:02:12,160<br />
Keep us.<br />
<br />
530<br />
02:02:20,450 --> 02:02:22,570<br />
Guide us.<br />
<br />
531<br />
02:02:31,720 --> 02:02:33,880<br />
To the end of time.<br />
<br />
532<br />
02:03:16,270 --> 02:03:18,100<br />
Follow me.<br />
<br />
533<br />
02:10:23,030 --> 02:10:24,930<br />
I give him to you.<br />
<br />
534<br />
02:10:30,170 --> 02:10:31,830<br />
I give you my son.<br />
<br />
