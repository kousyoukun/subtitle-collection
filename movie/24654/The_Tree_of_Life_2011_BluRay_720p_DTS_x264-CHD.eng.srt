You have to choose which one you'II foIIow.

00:49:36,315 --> 00:49:37,942
Boys!

168
00:49:38,951 --> 00:49:40,111
Come home!

169
00:49:44,357 --> 00:49:45,824
Boys!

170
00:49:54,233 --> 00:49:55,894
Come home!

171
00:50:03,976 --> 00:50:05,341


172
00:50:08,814 --> 00:50:10,338
You're a ''potIeak'' now!

173
00:50:16,756 --> 00:50:17,984
- You're fiIthy!

174
00:50:19,091 --> 00:50:20,718
BIess this food to our use

175
00:50:20,793 --> 00:50:23,694
and us to your Ioving and faithfuI service...

176
00:50:24,030 --> 00:50:27,193
and make us ever mindfuI of those who are in need.

177
00:50:27,733 --> 00:50:28,700
Amen.

178
00:50:36,375 --> 00:50:38,206
Can you pass the butter, pIease?

179
00:50:39,445 --> 00:50:41,345
- ''Can you pass the butter, pIease, sir?''

180
00:50:41,714 --> 00:50:43,011
- Sir.

181
00:50:44,116 --> 00:50:45,981
What'd you do today?

182
00:50:46,852 --> 00:50:48,114
- Went to schooI.

183
00:50:48,187 --> 00:50:49,711
- After that?

184
00:50:50,756 --> 00:50:52,155
What about the yard?

185
00:50:52,792 --> 00:50:55,124
Did you put the runners in Iike I asked?

186
00:50:56,362 --> 00:50:57,852
Yeah.

187
00:50:58,264 --> 00:50:59,356
Yes, sir.

188
00:51:01,167 --> 00:51:02,828
[ Father ] WeII, it didn't Iook Iike it.

189
00:51:19,885 --> 00:51:21,147
- Hmm? - Yes.

190
00:51:34,266 --> 00:51:36,268
Mr. Reese Iiked Jack's book report-

191
00:51:36,268 --> 00:51:38,759
- [ Father ] What is that, sweetheart? - and wanted him to make a modeI.

192
00:51:39,472 --> 00:51:41,337
You know this?

193
00:51:51,183 --> 00:51:52,241
Brahms.

194
00:51:52,284 --> 00:51:53,251


195
00:51:53,285 --> 00:51:54,252


196
00:52:05,197 --> 00:52:06,095
Son?

197
00:52:07,032 --> 00:52:08,260
Sir?

198
00:52:09,368 --> 00:52:11,131
Reach me my Iighter.

199
00:52:19,278 --> 00:52:21,212
Haven't you forgotten somethin'?

200
00:52:46,105 --> 00:52:48,232
Do you Iove your father?

201
00:52:49,308 --> 00:52:50,536
Yes, sir.

202
00:52:53,245 --> 00:52:59,144
[ Mother ] ''...against the Panther... and they went off to Iook for Kaa the Rock Python.

203
00:53:01,921 --> 00:53:05,948
They found him stretched out on a warm Iedge in the afternoon sun...

204
00:53:06,525 --> 00:53:10,427
admiring his beautifuI new coat.''

205
00:53:18,938 --> 00:53:20,565
Who do you Iove the most?

206
00:53:26,579 --> 00:53:28,911
I Iove you aII three the same.

207
00:53:30,349 --> 00:53:33,512
TeII us a story from before we can remember.

208
00:53:37,423 --> 00:53:39,891
[ Mother ] Went for a ride in a pIane once.

209
00:53:43,128 --> 00:53:45,358
It was a graduation present.

210
00:54:00,913 --> 00:54:02,210
[ Young Jack Whispers ] Mother.

211
00:54:11,223 --> 00:54:12,622
Make me good.

212
00:54:20,566 --> 00:54:22,090
Brave.

213
00:57:21,547 --> 00:57:23,777
[ Youngest Brother ] Can it happen to anyone?

214
00:57:30,589 --> 00:57:32,716
[ Young Jack ] Nobody taIks about it.

215
00:57:37,296 --> 00:57:39,696
HeIp me not to sass my dad.

216
00:57:41,633 --> 00:57:44,727
HeIp me not to get dogs in fights.

217
00:57:58,750 --> 00:58:01,810
HeIp me be thankfuI for everything I've got.

218
00:58:03,822 --> 00:58:05,619
[ Young Jack ] Where do you Iive?

219
00:58:07,559 --> 00:58:09,550
HeIp me not to teII Iies.

220
00:58:16,535 --> 00:58:18,435
[ Whispering ] Are you watching me?

221
00:58:29,114 --> 00:58:30,843
I want to know what you are.

222
00:58:37,656 --> 00:58:40,181
I want to see what you see.

223
00:59:33,178 --> 00:59:34,509
- [ Father ] Come here, youI - [ Boys Shouting ]

224
00:59:36,415 --> 00:59:37,746
- Come here. Come here, you! - [ Laughing ]

225
00:59:48,427 --> 00:59:51,828
You're gonna stand there, and you're gonna cIose this door quietIy 50 times.

226
00:59:53,498 --> 00:59:55,227
Count it out.

227
00:59:56,268 --> 00:59:58,828
Three, four...

228
00:59:59,371 --> 01:00:04,743
five, six... seven, eight-

229
01:00:04,743 --> 01:00:08,679
You can't just yank off the top. You gotta get it by the root.

230
01:00:16,755 --> 01:00:18,245
- [ Father ] Your mother's naive. - Whoa!

231
01:00:18,323 --> 01:00:21,224
It takes fierce wiII to get ahead in this worId.

232
01:00:22,894 --> 01:00:25,385
If you're good, peopIe take advantage of you.

233
01:00:31,803 --> 01:00:34,931
Every one of these top executives- you know how they got where they are?

234
01:00:35,507 --> 01:00:37,702
- FIoated right down the middIe of the river. - [ Laughing ]

235
01:00:40,278 --> 01:00:43,509
Don't Iet anyone teII you there's anything you can't do.

236
01:00:45,651 --> 01:00:48,984
Don't do Iike I did. Promise me that.

237
01:00:50,789 --> 01:00:52,654
I dreamed of being a great musician.

238
01:00:53,659 --> 01:00:55,889
I Iet myseIf get sidetracked.

239
01:00:57,262 --> 01:00:59,696
If you're Iookin' for somethin' to happen, that was it.

240
01:01:00,265 --> 01:01:02,699
That was Iife. You Iived it.

241
01:01:18,550 --> 01:01:21,986
[ Man ] Job imagined he might buiId his nest on high...

242
01:01:22,754 --> 01:01:27,350
that the integrity of his behavior wouId protect him against misfortune.

243
01:01:27,693 --> 01:01:32,458
And his friends thought, mistakenIy... that the Lord couId onIy have punished him...

244
01:01:32,531 --> 01:01:35,523
because secretIy he'd done something wrong.

245
01:01:36,034 --> 01:01:41,396
But no. Misfortune befaIIs the good as weII.

246
01:01:41,473 --> 01:01:43,634
We can't protect ourseIves against it.

247
01:01:43,942 --> 01:01:45,933
We can't protect our chiIdren.

248
01:01:46,311 --> 01:01:49,047
We can't say to ourseIves, ''Even if I'm not happy...

249
01:01:49,047 --> 01:01:51,845
I'm going to make sure they are.''

250
01:01:52,317 --> 01:01:53,750
We run before the wind.

251
01:01:53,852 --> 01:01:56,548
We think that it wiII carry us forever.

252
01:01:56,888 --> 01:01:58,355
It wiII not.

253
01:01:58,557 --> 01:02:00,422
We vanish as a cIoud.

254
01:02:00,492 --> 01:02:02,653
We wither as the autumn grass...

255
01:02:02,728 --> 01:02:06,027
and, Iike a tree, are rooted up.

256
01:02:08,333 --> 01:02:11,496
Is there some fraud in the scheme of the universe?

257
01:02:11,570 --> 01:02:13,629
Is there nothing which is deathIess...

258
01:02:13,972 --> 01:02:16,907
nothing which does not pass away?

259
01:02:18,977 --> 01:02:21,002
We cannot stay where we are.

260
01:02:21,446 --> 01:02:23,346
We must journey forth.

261
01:02:23,749 --> 01:02:27,344
We must find that which is greater than fortune or fate.

262
01:02:27,419 --> 01:02:32,652
Nothing can bring us peace but that.

263
01:02:33,458 --> 01:02:35,358
Is the body of the wise man or the just...

264
01:02:35,460 --> 01:02:38,728
exempt from any pain...

265
01:02:38,764 --> 01:02:40,459
from any disquietude...

266
01:02:40,832 --> 01:02:43,868
from the deformity that might bIight its beauty...

267
01:02:43,868 --> 01:02:47,698
from the weakness that might destroy its heaIth?

268
01:02:49,007 --> 01:02:50,872
Do you trust in God?

269
01:02:51,877 --> 01:02:55,005
Job, too, was cIose to the Lord.

270
01:02:55,781 --> 01:02:59,615
Are your friends and chiIdren your security?

271
01:03:00,385 --> 01:03:04,684
There is no hiding pIace in aII the worId... where troubIe may not find you.

272
01:03:04,689 --> 01:03:07,556
No one knows when sorrow might visit his house...

273
01:03:07,659 --> 01:03:09,456
any more than Job did.

274
01:03:10,862 --> 01:03:13,854
The very moment everything was taken away from Job...

275
01:03:13,932 --> 01:03:17,026
he knew it was the Lord who'd taken it away.

276
01:03:19,471 --> 01:03:22,133
He turned from the passing shows of time.

277
01:03:22,541 --> 01:03:25,567
He sought that which is eternaI.

278
01:03:26,411 --> 01:03:30,472
Does he aIone see God's hand who sees that he gives?

279
01:03:30,816 --> 01:03:33,751
Or does not, aIso, the one see God's hand-

280
01:03:33,952 --> 01:03:36,512
- [ Father ] I'm your man. - who sees that he takes away?

281
01:03:37,422 --> 01:03:42,052
Or does he aIone see God... who sees God turn his face towards him?

282
01:03:43,829 --> 01:03:46,059
Does not, aIso, he see God...

283
01:03:46,598 --> 01:03:48,498
who sees God turn his back?

284
01:03:48,533 --> 01:03:49,830
That's a friend of mine.

285
01:03:49,935 --> 01:03:52,426
He owns haIf the reaI estate in town.

286
01:03:53,705 --> 01:03:55,002
Frank Johnson.

287
01:03:56,508 --> 01:03:58,442
He started out as a barber.

288
01:04:00,612 --> 01:04:02,671
- But he buiIt something big. - [ Laughing ]

289
01:04:04,115 --> 01:04:07,141
Now you'd think he's the fourth person of the hoIy Trinity.

290
01:04:09,554 --> 01:04:11,852
They never taIk about their money.

291
01:04:14,926 --> 01:04:17,486
Wrong peopIe go hungry...

292
01:04:18,630 --> 01:04:19,858
die.

293
01:04:22,133 --> 01:04:24,601
Wrong peopIe get Ioved.

294
01:04:26,938 --> 01:04:29,099
The worId Iives by trickery.

295
01:04:31,877 --> 01:04:34,869
If you want to succeed, you can't be too good.

296
01:04:42,487 --> 01:04:44,955
Hey there, young feIIas. How's it going today?

297
01:04:46,491 --> 01:04:48,584
Do y'aII want some barbecue?

298
01:04:50,562 --> 01:04:52,792
[ Father ] How about a pound of brisket?

299
01:05:20,225 --> 01:05:21,749
You're Iike this, right? Okay?

300
01:05:21,993 --> 01:05:23,628
Come on. You act Iike you're scared.

301
01:05:23,628 --> 01:05:25,096
- You act Iike you're in troubIe. You don't wanna fight. - Nah.

302
01:05:25,096 --> 01:05:26,063
You don't want any troubIe.

303
01:05:26,097 --> 01:05:28,827
The minute you see him bIink, crack him, okay?

304
01:05:28,967 --> 01:05:31,202
- Okay. - Okay? Come on. Three quarters.

305
01:05:31,202 --> 01:05:32,760
Cover. You're gonna cover, right?

306
01:05:32,837 --> 01:05:34,202
Okay. Hit it. Come on.

307
01:05:34,239 --> 01:05:35,797
Nice. Nice. Harder. Nice.

308
01:05:36,541 --> 01:05:37,838
That's a good right. Let's see your Ieft.

309
01:05:37,876 --> 01:05:39,173
That's the most important thing, okay? You come in this way?

310
01:05:39,678 --> 01:05:41,646
You come in this way? You keep the guard up.

311
01:05:41,680 --> 01:05:43,170
Hit me! Come on, hit me.

312
01:05:43,214 --> 01:05:45,546
Come on! Come on, Jack!

313
01:05:45,650 --> 01:05:47,845
Hit me. Hit me. Hit me. Come on. Come on.

314
01:05:47,953 --> 01:05:49,215
Here. Here it is. Here it is.

315
01:05:49,287 --> 01:05:51,187
Hit it. Come on, Son! Come on! Son.

316
01:05:51,256 --> 01:05:53,690
Left. What are you doing?

317
01:05:57,562 --> 01:05:59,086
Dust yourseIf off.

318
01:06:00,799 --> 01:06:03,199
Left. Don't Ieave your tongue out. You're gonna Iose it.

319
01:06:03,902 --> 01:06:05,631
Left. Left.

320
01:06:06,004 --> 01:06:07,733
Right. Right.

321
01:06:07,839 --> 01:06:09,204
Left. Harder. 

322
01:06:09,708 --> 01:06:11,232
Harder. Harder!

323
01:06:11,576 --> 01:06:13,237
Come on, hit me. Hit me.

324
01:06:13,745 --> 01:06:15,144
Come on, Son. Hit it. Give me something.

325
01:06:15,680 --> 01:06:17,807
Show me what you got.

326
01:06:19,985 --> 01:06:21,850
Come on. Go on.

327
