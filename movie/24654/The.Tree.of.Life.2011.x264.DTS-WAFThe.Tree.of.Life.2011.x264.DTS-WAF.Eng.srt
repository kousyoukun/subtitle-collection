1
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,392
Brother.

2
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,838
Mother.

3
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:33,879
It was they who led me to your door.

4
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:07,391
The nuns taught us there are two ways through life-

5
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:11,878
the way of nature...

6
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:14,075
and the way of grace.

7
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:17,628
You have to choose which one you'll follow.

8
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,675
Grace doesn't try to please itself.

9
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:39,832
Accepts being slighted, forgotten, disliked.

10
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,992
Accepts insults and injuries.

11
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:08,751
Nature only wants to please itself.

12
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:12,958
Bless, O Lord, this food to our use- Get others to please it too.

13
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,712
...your loving and faithful service.

14
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,551
Likes to lord it over them.

15
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,551
Bless these boys.

16
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,028
To have its own

17
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:28,153
It finds reasons to be unhappy...

18
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:31,470
when all the world is shining around it,

19
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,313
when love is smiling through all things.

20
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:54,428
They taught us that no one who loves the way of grace...

21
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:57,159
ever comes to a bad end.

22
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,875
[ Woman ]I will be true to you.

23
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,233
Whatever comes.

24
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,753
Oh, God!

25
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,551
My son.

26
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,956
I just want to die...

27
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,951
to be with him.

28
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:30,078
He's in God's hands now.

29
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:38,718
He was in God's hands the whole time.

30
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:43,391
Wasn't he ?

31
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,391
My hope.

32
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,832
My God.

33
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,550
I shall fear no evil- fear no evil, for you are with me.

34
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,674
fear no evil, for you are with me.

35
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,716
What did you gain ?

36
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,075
Be not far from me, for trouble is near.

37
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:15,310
Okay, go on now. We're all right.

38
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,356
We're all right.

39
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,276
Thank you. Thank you.

40
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:40,273
-Sure, you have your memories of him, and, uh-

41
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:42,430
you're gonna have to be strong now and-

42
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,558
I know the pain will-

43
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,516
It will pass in time, you know?

44
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:53,273
It might seem... hard, my saying that,

45
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,918
but it's true.

46
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:56,911
I don't want it to.

47
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:01,476
Life goes on.

48
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,351
People pass along.

49
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,475
Nothing stays the same.

50
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:15,074
You've still got the other two.

51
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,839
The Lord gives, and the Lord takes away,

52
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:28,031
and that's the way he is.

53
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,549
He sends flies to wounds...

54
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,790
that he should heal.

55
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:58,917
I ne ver got a chance to tell him how sorry I was.

56
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:07,191
One night he...

57
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:12,869
punched him- himself in the face for no reason.

58
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:22,270
He was sitting next to me at the piano,

59
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:24,919
and I criticized the way he turned the pages.

60
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:45,315
I made him feel shame.

61
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,632
My shame.

62
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,433
That poor boy.

63
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:58,396
That poor boy.

64
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:30,110
How did you come to me?

65
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,270
In what shape ?

66
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,472
What disguise ?

67
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:11,390
I see the child that I was.

68
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:23,388
I see my brother.

69
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,952
True.

70
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:31,509
Kind.

71
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:41,514
He died when he was 19.

72
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:17,396
Just check this¡ª this one against this.

73
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:21,359
She wants to get back together, but... that chapter's closed,

74
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,271
story's been told.

75
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,471
What are you gonna do?

76
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:29,552
Experiment.

77
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,794
When you're young, it's all about your career.

78
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:38,915
You don't understand anything.

79
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:50,150
I just feel like I'm bumping into walls.

80
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:05,593
I didn't know how to do her hair.

81
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:30,388
Hey, Dad. I'm sorry I said what I said. I-

82
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:39,594
Yeah. Yeah, I think about him every day.

83
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:43,195
I just  shouldn't have said what I did, and I'm sorry.

84
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:49,838
No, it's just, oh, this day.

85
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,637
What are you thinkin'?

86
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:56,029
I know- I know you did everything you could.

87
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:59,271
And only two of those were turned down by the client.

88
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:00,918
One of them-

89
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,030
How did I lose you ?

90
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,872
Wandered?

91
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:38,078
Forgot you ?

92
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,711
Find me.

93
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:06,511
How did she bear it?

94
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:17,952
Mother.

95
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:57,755
Was I false to you ?

96
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,152
Lord.

97
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,112
Why?

98
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,791
Where were you ?

99
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:08,510
Did you know?

100
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:26,431
Who are we to you ?

101
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,071
Answer me.

102
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,150
We cry to you.

103
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:09,511
My soul.

104
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,832
My son.

105
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,838
Hear us.

106
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:36,595
Light of my life.

107
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:41,990
I search for you.

108
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:48,112
My hope.

109
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:00,516
My child.

110
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:22,350
You spoke to me through her.

111
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:28,714
You spoke with from the sky.

112
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:32,318
The trees.

113
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:39,629
Before I knew I loved you,

114
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,991
believed in you.

115
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:05,153
When did you first touch my heart?

116
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:42,275
And manfully to fight under his banner...

117
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:44,748
against sin, the world and the devil.

118
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:28,074
We had the commander over for dinner.

119
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:30,548
This little devil bit him right on the ankle.

120
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:50,711
Mama!

121
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:03,714
Me!

122
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,116
Rhinoceros.

123
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:14,917
Two alligator.

124
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:16,751
Two alligators.

125
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:24,869
Kangaroo. Kangaroo.

126
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:36,628
Jump.

127
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:44,069
Sweetheart.

128
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:48,592
Shh! Please

129
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:52,834
I know. No!

130
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:21,190
It's mine!

131
00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:26,398
You found me.

132
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:05,757
You'll be grown before that tree is tall.

133
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:12,230
Blue. Far.

134
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:17,155
You.

135
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:30,793
Are you afraid?

136
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,672
Come here.

137
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:30,957
Come here. All right. Now, come back here, Son. Stay out of there.

138
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:32,871
That's the Spencers' yard. Okay?

139
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:37,237
You see this line? Let's not cross it. Do you understand?

140
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:40,073
Hmm? Do you understand?

141
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:42,833
You see this line? Look it here. Look here.

142
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:47,194
Okay. Now, come back here, Son. Come on back.

143
00:46:54,360 --> 00:46:56,032
Stay out of there.

144
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:16,515
'"Now, my dears,' said old Mrs. Rabbit one morning,

145
00:47:16,520 --> 00:47:18,875
'you may go into the fields or down the lane,

146
00:47:20,080 --> 00:47:22,514
but don't go

147
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:25,636
Father had an accident there."'

148
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:34,999
That's where God lives.

149
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:06,191
Good night. We'll see ya in five years.

150
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:05,039
You want to eat a grasshopper?

151
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:07,600
I found a dinosaur bone!

152
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,911
Is that a rock? No.

153
00:49:36,120 --> 00:49:37,792
Boys!

154
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:40,119
Come home!

155
00:49:44,760 --> 00:49:46,398
Boys!

156
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:56,555
Come home!

157
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:11,275
You're a "potleak" now!

158
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:14,113
-You're filthy!

159
00:50:19,120 --> 00:50:24,069
Bless this food to our use and us to your loving and faithful service,

160
00:50:24,080 --> 00:50:27,709
and make us ever mindful of those who are in need.

161
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:29,472
Amen.

162
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:39,517
Can you pass the butter, please?

163
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:42,318
Can you pass the butter, please, sir? Sir.

164
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:45,912
What'd you do today?

165
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:49,309
After that? Went to school

166
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:54,554
What about the yard? Did you put the runners in like I asked?

167
00:50:56,320 --> 00:50:57,878
Yeah.

168
00:50:57,880 --> 00:50:59,518
Yes, sir.

169
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:03,589
Well, it didn't look like it.

170
00:51:19,360 --> 00:51:20,998
Yes. Hmm?

171
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:36,310
Mr. Reese liked Jack's book report-

172
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:38,675
What is that, sweetheart? and wanted him to make a model.

173
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:41,796
You know this?

174
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:53,316
Brahms.

175
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:06,918
Son?

176
00:52:06,920 --> 00:52:08,273
Sir?

177
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:11,709
Reach me my lighter.

178
00:52:19,240 --> 00:52:21,231
Haven't you forgotten somethin'?

179
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:48,231
Do you love your father?

180
00:52:49,360 --> 00:52:50,998
Yes, sir.

181
00:52:53,080 --> 00:52:55,674
"... against the Panther,

182
00:52:55,680 --> 00:52:59,309
and they went off to look for Kaa the Rock Python.

183
00:53:01,840 --> 00:53:06,789
They found him stretched out on a warm ledge in the afternoon sun,

184
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:09,268
admiring his beautiful new coat."

185
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:20,951
Who do you love the most?

186
00:53:26,320 --> 00:53:28,788
I love you all three the same.

187
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:33,472
Tell us a story from before we can remember.

188
00:53:37,320 --> 00:53:39,311
Went for a ride in a plane once.

189
00:53:43,080 --> 00:53:45,389
it was a graduation present.

190
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:02,552
Mother.

191
00:54:11,240 --> 00:54:13,196
Make me good.

192
00:54:20,680 --> 00:54:22,352
Brave.

193
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:23,909
Can it happen to anyone ?

194
00:57:30,560 --> 00:57:32,710
Nobody talks about it.

195
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:38,871
Help me not to sass my dad.

196
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:44,551
Help me not to get dogs in fights.

197
00:57:58,760 --> 00:58:01,752
Help me be thankful for everything I've got.

198
00:58:03,880 --> 00:58:06,030
Where do you live ?

199
00:58:07,040 --> 00:58:08,871
Help me not to tell lies.

200
00:58:16,600 --> 00:58:18,955
Are you watching me?

201
00:58:28,840 --> 00:58:31,035
I want to know what you

202
00:58:37,640 --> 00:58:40,234
I want to see what you

203
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:35,315
Come here.

204
00:59:35,320 --> 00:59:38,392
Come here. Come here, you!

205
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:42,152
That funny?

206
00:59:48,360 --> 00:59:52,035
You're gonna stand there, and you're gonna close this door quietly 50 times.

207
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:56,034
Count it out.

208
00:59:56,040 --> 00:59:59,191
Three, four,

209
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:02,112
five, six,

210
01:00:02,120 --> 01:00:04,873
seven, eight-

211
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:08,395
You can't just yank off the top. You gotta get it by the root.

212
01:00:16,200 --> 01:00:18,236
Your mother's naive. Whoa!

213
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:21,073
It takes fierce will to get ahead in this world.

214
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:25,393
If you 're good, people take advantage of you.

215
01:00:31,720 --> 01:00:35,269
Every one of these top executives- you know how they got where they are ?

216
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:38,909
Floated right down the middle of the river.

217
01:00:40,240 --> 01:00:43,755
Don't let anyone tell you there's anything you can't do.

218
01:00:45,520 --> 01:00:48,512
Don't do like I did. Promise me that.

219
01:00:50,600 --> 01:00:52,591
I dreamed of being a great musician.

220
01:00:53,600 --> 01:00:57,070
I let myself get sidetracked.

221
01:00:57,080 --> 01:00:59,913
If you're lookin' for somethin' to happen, that was it.

222
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:01,638
That was life. You lived it.

223
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:22,678
Job imagined he might build his nest on high,

224
01:01:22,680 --> 01:01:27,515
that the integrity of his behavior would protect him against misfortune.

225
01:01:27,520 --> 01:01:29,511
And his friends thought, mistakenly,

226
01:01:29,520 --> 01:01:32,353
that the Lord could only have punished him...

227
01:01:32,360 --> 01:01:36,069
because secretly he'd done something wrong.

228
01:01:36,080 --> 01:01:37,672
But no.

229
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:41,275
Misfortune befalls the good as well.

230
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:43,589
We can't protect ourselves against it.

231
01:01:43,600 --> 01:01:46,114
We can't protect our children.

232
01:01:46,120 --> 01:01:49,078
We can't say to ourselves, "Even if I'm not happy,

233
01:01:49,080 --> 01:01:51,913
I'm going to make sure they

234
01:01:51,920 --> 01:01:53,911
We run before the wind.

235
01:01:53,920 --> 01:01:56,753
We think that it will carry us forever.

236
01:01:56,760 --> 01:01:58,398
It will not.

237
01:01:58,400 --> 01:02:00,311
We vanish as a cloud.

238
01:02:00,320 --> 01:02:02,675
We wither as the autumn grass...

239
01:02:02,680 --> 01:02:05,990
and, like a tree, are rooted up.

240
01:02:08,120 --> 01:02:11,430
Is there some fraud in the scheme of the universe?

241
01:02:11,440 --> 01:02:13,908
Is there nothing which is deathless,

242
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:16,832
nothing which does not pass away?

243
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:21,235
We cannot stay where we are.

244
01:02:21,240 --> 01:02:23,629
We must journey forth.

245
01:02:23,640 --> 01:02:28,077
We must find that which is greater than fortune or fate.

246
01:02:29,080 --> 01:02:32,311
Nothing can bring us peace but that.

247
01:02:33,360 --> 01:02:36,636
Is the body of the wise man or the just...

248
01:02:36,640 --> 01:02:38,631
exempt from any pain,

249
01:02:38,640 --> 01:02:40,835
from any disquietude,

250
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:43,673
from the deformity that might blight its beauty,

251
01:02:43,680 --> 01:02:46,877
from the weakness that might destroy its health ?

252
01:02:48,920 --> 01:02:51,878
Do you trust in God?

253
01:02:51,880 --> 01:02:55,714
Job, too, was close to the L ord.

254
01:02:55,720 --> 01:02:58,359
Are your friends and children your security?

255
01:02:59,880 --> 01:03:02,189
There is no hiding place in all the world...

256
01:03:02,200 --> 01:03:04,589
where trouble may not find you.

257
01:03:04,600 --> 01:03:07,478
No one knows when sorrow might visit his house...

258
01:03:07,480 --> 01:03:10,677
any more than Job did.

259
01:03:10,680 --> 01:03:13,877
The very moment everything was taken away from Job,

260
01:03:13,880 --> 01:03:17,077
he knew it was the Lord who 'd taken it away.

261
01:03:19,280 --> 01:03:22,397
He turned from the passing shows of time.

262
01:03:22,400 --> 01:03:24,834
He sought that which is eternal.

263
01:03:26,240 --> 01:03:30,677
Does he alone see God's hand who sees that he gives ?

264
01:03:30,680 --> 01:03:32,830
Or does not, also, the one see God's hand-

265
01:03:32,840 --> 01:03:36,389
who sees that he takes away? I'm your man.

266
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:38,994
Or does he alone see God,

267
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:41,195
who sees God turn his face towards him?

268
01:03:43,160 --> 01:03:46,835
Does not, also, he see God...

269
01:03:46,840 --> 01:03:48,592
who sees God turn his back?

270
01:03:48,600 --> 01:03:51,433
That's a friend of mine. He owns half the real estate in town.

271
01:03:53,600 --> 01:03:55,272
Frank Johnson.

272
01:03:56,280 --> 01:03:59,272
He started out as a barber.

273
01:04:00,520 --> 01:04:04,195
-But he built something big.

274
01:04:04,200 --> 01:04:07,272
Now you'd think he's the fourth person of the holy Trinity.

275
01:04:09,400 --> 01:04:11,960
They never talk about their money.

276
01:04:14,840 --> 01:04:16,831
Wrong people go hungry,

277
01:04:18,440 --> 01:04:20,078
die.

278
01:04:22,120 --> 01:04:25,112
Wrong people get loved.

279
01:04:26,920 --> 01:04:28,956
The world lives by trickery.

280
01:04:31,800 --> 01:04:34,792
If you want to succeed, you can't be too good.

281
01:04:42,320 --> 01:04:45,312
Hey there, young fellas. How's it going today?

282
01:04:46,320 --> 01:04:48,311
Do y'all want some barbecue?

283
01:04:50,480 --> 01:04:52,675
How about a pound of brisket?

284
01:05:20,080 --> 01:05:23,311
You're like this, right? Okay? Come on. You act like you're

285
01:05:23,320 --> 01:05:25,595
You act like you're in trouble You don't wanna fight. Nah

286
01:05:25,600 --> 01:05:28,751
You don't want any trouble. The minute you see him blink, crack him, okay?

287
01:05:28,760 --> 01:05:31,149
Okay? Come on. Three quarters. Okay

288
01:05:31,160 --> 01:05:34,277
Cover. You're gonna cover, right? Okay. Hit it. Come on.

289
01:05:34,280 --> 01:05:37,590
Nice. Nice. Harder. Nice. That's a good right. Let's see your left.

290
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:40,319
That's the most important thing, okay? You come in this way?

291
01:05:40,320 --> 01:05:43,232
You come in this way? You keep the guard up. Hit me! Come on, hit me.

292
01:05:43,240 --> 01:05:47,791
Come on! Come on, Jack! Hit me. Hit me. Hit me. Come on. Come on.

293
01:05:47,800 --> 01:05:51,156
Here. Here it is. Here it is. Hit it. Come on, Son! Come on! Son.

294
01:05:51,160 --> 01:05:53,594
Left. What are you doing?

295
01:05:57,240 --> 01:06:00,198
Dust yourself off.

296
01:06:00,200 --> 01:06:03,715
Left. Don't leave your tongue out. You're gonna lose it.

297
01:06:03,720 --> 01:06:05,870
Left. Left.

298
01:06:05,880 --> 01:06:07,711
Right. Right.

299
01:06:07,720 --> 01:06:11,269
Left. Harder. Harder. Harder!

300
01:06:11,280 --> 01:06:13,555
Come on, hit me. Hit me.

301
01:06:13,560 --> 01:06:16,313
Come on, Son. Hit it. Give me something.

302
01:06:16,320 --> 01:06:18,311
Show me what you got.

303
01:06:19,920 --> 01:06:21,911
Come on. Go on.

304
01:06:27,640 --> 01:06:29,278
One meal.

305
01:06:44,520 --> 01:06:46,431
Leave the table.

306
01:06:52,320 --> 01:06:53,992
You too?

307
01:06:55,600 --> 01:06:57,716
You gonna continue to defy me? No, sir.

308
01:06:57,720 --> 01:07:00,792
You interrupted me. I wasn't done yet.

309
01:07:03,800 --> 01:07:08,278
Am I finished?

310
01:07:06,640 --> 01:07:08,278
May I?

311
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:12,119
Thank you, Your Majesty.

312
01:08:08,600 --> 01:08:10,750
Makes up stories.

313
01:08:13,840 --> 01:08:15,751
Original words.

314
01:08:23,840 --> 01:08:26,991
He says, "Don't put your elbows on the table."

315
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:28,877
Are you ready?

316
01:08:28,880 --> 01:08:30,836
He does.

317
01:08:34,280 --> 01:08:36,191
Insults people.

318
01:08:37,680 --> 01:08:39,398
Doesn 't care.

319
01:08:39,400 --> 01:08:41,709
f Father ] I remember when you were born.

320
01:08:46,840 --> 01:08:48,831
They wouldn't let me come home.

321
01:08:50,560 --> 01:08:54,109
The navy said an officer must be present for the laying of the keel,

322
01:08:54,120 --> 01:08:58,113
but... not at the launching.

323
01:09:42,160 --> 01:09:44,435
The next word is "volcano."

324
01:09:54,960 --> 01:09:56,996
The next word is "socket."

325
01:10:03,040 --> 01:10:06,874
Please pass your answers to each other. We're gonna grade each other's papers now.

326
01:10:12,680 --> 01:10:14,671
No interruptions, please.

327
01:10:16,400 --> 01:10:18,868
Come on. Get your pencil out.

328
01:10:23,800 --> 01:10:26,314
After logs go to the paper mill-

329
01:11:39,520 --> 01:11:43,229
Taylor! Taylor, sweetheart!

330
01:11:43,240 --> 01:11:45,549
Honey! Honey!

331
01:11:52,400 --> 01:11:53,879
Let me go!

332
01:13:13,880 --> 01:13:15,791
Was he bad?

333
01:13:25,280 --> 01:13:27,794
Will you die too?

334
01:13:30,600 --> 01:13:33,114
You 're not that old yet, Mom.

335
01:13:50,800 --> 01:13:52,631
Where were you ?

336
01:14:04,840 --> 01:14:06,751
You let a boy die.

337
01:14:13,720 --> 01:14:16,188
You'll let anything happen.

338
01:14:29,480 --> 01:14:32,950
I can't see!

339
01:14:36,600 --> 01:14:38,556
Why should I be good...

340
01:14:42,560 --> 01:14:45,233
if you aren't?

341
01:15:34,120 --> 01:15:35,792
Thank you.

342
01:15:50,480 --> 01:15:53,153
Too close.

343
01:15:53,160 --> 01:15:55,230
Edges.

344
01:15:55,240 --> 01:15:57,834
Why's this bare here, hmm?

345
01:15:57,840 --> 01:16:01,230
Grass won't grow under the trees. Does at the Kimballs'

346
01:16:01,240 --> 01:16:04,437
They have a yardman. They have money.

347
01:16:04,440 --> 01:16:06,431
Course, he inherited it.

348
01:16:08,440 --> 01:16:11,876
I don't want to hear one more word out of not till this is finished.

349
01:16:23,680 --> 01:16:25,272
Hmm?

350
01:16:29,320 --> 01:16:30,878
Hmm?

351
01:16:52,760 --> 01:16:54,512
Cropping that too close.

352
01:16:54,520 --> 01:16:56,192
You're gonna have to keep that watered.

353
01:17:03,600 --> 01:17:05,591
Not high enough.

354
01:17:23,800 --> 01:17:25,756
Toscanini...

355
01:17:25,760 --> 01:17:28,069
once recorded a piece 65 times.

356
01:17:28,080 --> 01:17:30,548
You know what he said when he finished?

357
01:17:30,560 --> 01:17:32,630
It could be better.

358
01:17:34,080 --> 01:17:35,752
Think about it.

359
01:17:38,280 --> 01:17:40,794
Twenty-seven patents your father has.

360
01:17:42,360 --> 01:17:45,272
It means ownership. Ownership of ideas.

361
01:17:46,840 --> 01:17:49,229
You gotta sew 'em up. Get 'em by the nuts-

362
01:17:49,240 --> 01:17:51,834
pardon my French. We'll get 'em next time.

363
01:17:51,840 --> 01:17:53,592
We'll be rich.

364
01:17:56,680 --> 01:17:59,194
You make yourself what you are.

365
01:18:02,760 --> 01:18:05,593
You ha ve control of your own destiny.

366
01:18:08,640 --> 01:18:10,676
You can't say, "I can't."

367
01:18:11,800 --> 01:18:13,756
You say "I'm having trouble.

368
01:18:14,960 --> 01:18:16,757
I'm not done yet."

369
01:18:18,520 --> 01:18:20,954
You can't say, "I can't."

370
01:18:54,840 --> 01:18:57,070
Why does he hurt us ?

371
01:18:59,360 --> 01:19:01,032
Our father.

372
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:08,911
Come on, Dix. Come on!

373
01:19:08,920 --> 01:19:10,319
Ah, yeah. Get it! Get it!

374
01:19:24,520 --> 01:19:26,590
Give your father a kiss.

375
01:20:05,800 --> 01:20:07,392
He lies.

376
01:20:11,080 --> 01:20:13,469
Pretends. Can you do something for me?

377
01:20:13,480 --> 01:20:16,040
You promise you'll do it without having to ask what it is?

378
01:20:16,040 --> 01:20:18,759
Just have the confidence that what your father asks of you is right?

379
01:20:18,760 --> 01:20:20,637
Yes, sir.

380
01:20:20,640 --> 01:20:25,350
For the next half hour, will you not speak unless you have something important to say?

381
01:20:30,760 --> 01:20:33,274
What'd you do today, my fine feathered friend?

382
01:20:35,080 --> 01:20:39,596
Sit on the front two inches of your chair. Better for your posture.

383
01:20:39,600 --> 01:20:41,591
I read that in the paper.

384
01:20:44,680 --> 01:20:48,150
Did you actually buy this from Mr. Led better?

385
01:20:48,160 --> 01:20:50,833
Don't explain. Just nod- yes or no.

386
01:20:52,080 --> 01:20:53,752
Hmm? No.

387
01:20:56,240 --> 01:20:57,559
Be quiet.

388
01:21:00,600 --> 01:21:02,591
What did you say?

389
01:21:05,320 --> 01:21:07,072
Please.

390
01:21:07,080 --> 01:21:08,798
Leave him alone! Come here!

391
01:21:08,800 --> 01:21:11,075
Honey!

392
01:21:11,080 --> 01:21:14,595
[ Record Player Needle Scratches ] Leave him alone!

393
01:21:17,880 --> 01:21:20,314
Come here! Get back. Come here.

394
01:21:24,600 --> 01:21:26,511
Get up there!

395
01:22:22,720 --> 01:22:24,472
You turned my own kids against me.

396
01:22:26,160 --> 01:22:28,116
You undermine everything I do.

397
01:22:37,400 --> 01:22:38,992
How do you like- Stop-

398
01:22:39,800 --> 01:22:41,233
Stop it.

399
01:22:41,240 --> 01:22:44,391
Stop it! Stop. Stop it.

400
01:22:48,440 --> 01:22:49,793
Stop it.

401
01:22:52,720 --> 01:22:54,233
Stop it.

402
01:22:59,760 --> 01:23:01,910
Stop. Stop.

403
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:02,956
Where's Dad?

404
01:25:02,960 --> 01:25:05,030
He's gone on a trip.

405
01:25:24,560 --> 01:25:26,039
No!

406
01:25:35,680 --> 01:25:37,557
Open the door!

407
01:25:48,720 --> 01:25:50,233
No! Get her!

408
01:25:50,240 --> 01:25:51,798
Help each other.

409
01:25:53,080 --> 01:25:56,072
Do not slam that screen door!

410
01:25:57,840 --> 01:26:00,673
Love e very one.

411
01:26:02,640 --> 01:26:04,596
Every leaf.

412
01:26:06,200 --> 01:26:08,760
Every ray of tight.

413
01:26:16,320 --> 01:26:18,231
Forgive.

414
01:26:45,680 --> 01:26:47,671
This is my house!

415
01:26:47,680 --> 01:26:49,511
You're allowed to live here!

416
01:26:49,520 --> 01:26:51,670
You are allowed to live here!

417
01:26:53,360 --> 01:26:55,271
Get out of my way!

418
01:26:55,280 --> 01:26:57,157
No!

419
01:26:57,160 --> 01:26:58,991
Shut up!

420
01:27:13,320 --> 01:27:16,312
I got it, I got it, I got it!

421
01:27:53,760 --> 01:27:56,479
Boom! Boom! Boom, boom! Boom, boom!

422
01:27:56,480 --> 01:27:58,232
Watch out! Watch out!

423
01:28:06,800 --> 01:28:09,519
One, two, three!

424
01:28:17,680 --> 01:28:19,398
I say let's bust 'em.

425
01:28:32,280 --> 01:28:33,918
Yeah! Yeah!

426
01:28:45,760 --> 01:28:47,079
We found a frog!

427
01:28:48,680 --> 01:28:50,557
Let's go set it off with a skyrocket!

428
01:28:50,560 --> 01:28:52,073
He's getting away!

429
01:28:53,960 --> 01:28:55,916
Get back! Get back!

430
01:29:03,120 --> 01:29:05,076
Did it go to the moon?

431
01:29:07,760 --> 01:29:09,432
Where is he?

432
01:29:09,440 --> 01:29:11,112
Here he is.

433
01:29:13,080 --> 01:29:15,116
It was an experiment!

434
01:29:19,280 --> 01:29:20,633
Liar.

435
01:29:22,800 --> 01:29:24,631
Never do it again.

436
01:29:25,640 --> 01:29:27,119
Promise?

437
01:29:30,600 --> 01:29:32,989
You gonna tell Dad?

438
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:36,117
They're just trying to scare you.

439
01:29:38,800 --> 01:29:40,597
Keep you ignorant.

440
01:29:44,800 --> 01:29:46,472
Things you got to learn.

441
01:29:50,600 --> 01:29:52,716
How can we know stuff until we look?

442
01:30:11,200 --> 01:30:14,556
They say you can't try stuff? They do.

443
01:30:18,800 --> 01:30:20,392
What do you need to be afraid of?

444
01:30:24,160 --> 01:30:25,752
You're afraid.

445
01:30:27,440 --> 01:30:28,714
I see it.

446
01:30:28,720 --> 01:30:31,518
Right here! Right here!

447
01:35:55,960 --> 01:35:58,190
I can't talk to you.

448
01:36:07,240 --> 01:36:09,595
Don't look at me.

449
01:36:57,240 --> 01:36:58,753
[Young Jack]|What have I started?

450
01:37:02,800 --> 01:37:04,597
What have I done ?

451
01:37:35,200 --> 01:37:36,952
Stick it in there.

452
01:38:16,360 --> 01:38:18,032
I trust you.

453
01:38:33,600 --> 01:38:35,989
[ Jack ] No! You tired?

454
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:38,514
I never get tired!

455
01:38:38,520 --> 01:38:40,909
Did this morning. No, I was just pretending

456
01:38:41,920 --> 01:38:44,195
Gonna call me a liar? No.

457
01:38:44,200 --> 01:38:46,191
I don't want to fight.

458
01:38:46,200 --> 01:38:48,350
Afraid to?

459
01:38:48,360 --> 01:38:50,191
No, I just don't wanna.

460
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:54,753
If I was to say you're scared, would you call me a liar?

461
01:38:54,760 --> 01:38:55,909
No.

462
01:38:57,160 --> 01:38:59,151
Then you 're scared, aren't you ?

463
01:39:10,280 --> 01:39:11,952
Quit it.

464
01:39:14,440 --> 01:39:15,793
Come here.

465
01:39:59,920 --> 01:40:01,592
Come here!

466
01:40:04,200 --> 01:40:05,758
No!

467
01:40:08,680 --> 01:40:11,240
I'm not gonna do everything you tell me to.

468
01:40:12,480 --> 01:40:14,755
I'm gonna do what I want.

469
01:40:18,280 --> 01:40:20,953
What do you know? You let him run all over you.

470
01:41:11,680 --> 01:41:13,671
How do I get back...

471
01:41:19,120 --> 01:41:20,758
where they are ?

472
01:41:43,880 --> 01:41:45,871
How are you, Son? Good.

473
01:41:55,560 --> 01:41:58,518
This one's heavy. You're gonna need two hands for that one.

474
01:42:08,320 --> 01:42:10,550
Careful now. You know what that-

475
01:42:10,560 --> 01:42:12,357
Know what that- That's Chinese. Chinese?

476
01:42:12,360 --> 01:42:14,351
That's very good. Yes, it is.

477
01:42:16,040 --> 01:42:18,998
Your father went all around the world, all the way to China.

478
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:20,956
That's Pan Am airlines.

479
01:42:20,960 --> 01:42:22,916
That's what your father flew on.

480
01:42:22,920 --> 01:42:25,957
The entire bathrooms are stainless steel, even the washbasin.

481
01:42:25,960 --> 01:42:29,350
I feel confident the deal's going through.

482
01:42:29,360 --> 01:42:32,272
If not, they can forget it. I'll tell them all to go to hell.

483
01:42:32,280 --> 01:42:34,475
-That's from Germany. -How do you use them?

484
01:42:34,480 --> 01:42:35,913
See that?

485
01:42:39,080 --> 01:42:41,036
Put that down, Son.

486
01:42:41,040 --> 01:42:43,474
Can Cayler come over?

487
01:42:43,480 --> 01:42:45,914
Is your family not good enough for you?

488
01:42:52,040 --> 01:42:56,079
-Hope it's not gonna take as long as last time.

489
01:42:56,080 --> 01:42:57,559
Al dente.

490
01:43:00,920 --> 01:43:03,309
Subjective point of view. You know the difference?

491
01:43:03,320 --> 01:43:06,471
Subjective means it comes from your mind. Can't be proven by other people.

492
01:43:08,640 --> 01:43:10,232
So- Here you

493
01:43:14,840 --> 01:43:17,115
Good to see you again. Okay.

494
01:43:17,120 --> 01:43:19,270
Let's go, boys.

495
01:43:19,280 --> 01:43:20,633
Come on.

496
01:43:21,920 --> 01:43:23,956
There are things you can't do?

497
01:43:23,960 --> 01:43:25,951
Well, there are things I can't do either.

498
01:43:27,720 --> 01:43:29,756
You are not to call me "Dad." You will call me "Father."

499
01:43:29,760 --> 01:43:31,637
But- Don't interrupt! But-

500
01:43:31,640 --> 01:43:33,471
But you do

501
01:43:39,480 --> 01:43:41,038
It's your house.

502
01:43:41,040 --> 01:43:43,315
You can kick me out whenever you want to.

503
01:43:48,880 --> 01:43:50,950
You'd like to kill me.

504
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:11,831
[ Father ] No- Dad.

505
01:44:16,320 --> 01:44:18,356
Why was he born?

506
01:45:43,840 --> 01:45:46,354
Please, God, kill him.

507
01:45:50,680 --> 01:45:52,716
Let him die.

508
01:45:57,320 --> 01:45:59,117
Get him out of here.

509
01:46:20,840 --> 01:46:22,796
She only loves me!

510
01:46:34,400 --> 01:46:38,473
Defend, O Lord, this thy child with thy heavenly grace,

511
01:46:38,480 --> 01:46:41,552
that he may continue thine forever...

512
01:46:41,560 --> 01:46:45,553
arid daily increase in thy holy spirit more and more...

513
01:46:45,560 --> 01:46:49,633
until he come unto thy everlasting kingdom.

514
01:46:49,640 --> 01:46:50,959
Amen.

515
01:47:31,840 --> 01:47:33,512
I see something.

516
01:48:24,440 --> 01:48:26,158
Put your finger over it.

517
01:48:28,320 --> 01:48:29,639
Like that.

518
01:48:31,840 --> 01:48:33,114
Come on.

519
01:49:30,480 --> 01:49:33,233
What i want to do, i can't do.

520
01:49:38,920 --> 01:49:40,831
I do what I hate.

521
01:50:42,240 --> 01:50:43,958
You can hit me if you want.

522
01:51:02,040 --> 01:51:03,439
I'm sorry.

523
01:51:06,920 --> 01:51:08,751
You're my brother.

524
01:51:52,840 --> 01:51:54,990
What was it you showed me?

525
01:52:04,160 --> 01:52:07,038
I didn't know how to name you then.

526
01:52:11,480 --> 01:52:13,596
But I see it was you.

527
01:52:19,360 --> 01:52:21,510
Always you were calling me.

528
01:54:11,160 --> 01:54:14,470
I wanted to be loved because I was great.

529
01:54:16,960 --> 01:54:18,996
A big man.

530
01:54:21,520 --> 01:54:23,033
I'm nothin'.

531
01:54:26,920 --> 01:54:29,832
Look... at the glory around us.

532
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:35,514
Trees and birds.

533
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:40,592
I lived in shame.

534
01:54:44,400 --> 01:54:47,472
I dishonored it all and didn't notice the glory.

535
01:54:53,520 --> 01:54:55,351
I'm a foolish man.

536
01:55:00,520 --> 01:55:02,511
They're closing the plant.

537
01:55:06,600 --> 01:55:09,114
They gave me a choice.

538
01:55:11,520 --> 01:55:13,272
No job...

539
01:55:16,040 --> 01:55:19,396
or a transfer to a job nobody wants.

540
01:55:28,360 --> 01:55:30,032
Father.

541
01:55:32,360 --> 01:55:35,352
I never missed a day of work.

542
01:55:35,360 --> 01:55:37,396
Mother.

543
01:55:37,400 --> 01:55:40,039
I tithed e very Sunday.

544
01:55:43,560 --> 01:55:46,632
Always you wrestle inside me.

545
01:55:51,600 --> 01:55:53,591
Always you will.

546
01:55:55,560 --> 01:55:59,872
You know, Jack, all I ever wanted for you was...

547
01:55:59,880 --> 01:56:02,792
to make you strong and-

548
01:56:02,800 --> 01:56:04,870
and grow up and be your own boss.

549
01:56:08,320 --> 01:56:10,470
Maybe I've been tough on you.

550
01:56:12,360 --> 01:56:14,396
I'm not proud of that.

551
01:56:16,680 --> 01:56:18,716
I'm as bad as you are.

552
01:56:21,240 --> 01:56:23,913
I'm more like you than her.

553
01:56:32,520 --> 01:56:35,751
You boys are about all I've done in life. Otherwise I've drawn zilch.

554
01:56:44,520 --> 01:56:46,954
You're all I have. You're all I want to have.

555
01:56:54,960 --> 01:56:56,916
My sweet boy.

556
01:59:03,720 --> 01:59:06,280
You just gonna stand there like a bump on a log?

557
01:59:10,560 --> 01:59:12,073
Go on.

558
01:59:16,640 --> 01:59:18,119
Come on.

559
02:00:17,840 --> 02:00:20,513
The only way to be happy is to love.

560
02:00:24,840 --> 02:00:26,717
Unless you love,

561
02:00:28,680 --> 02:00:30,671
your life will flash by.

562
02:00:41,880 --> 02:00:43,871
Do good to them.

563
02:00:48,680 --> 02:00:50,113
Wonder.

564
02:00:54,880 --> 02:00:56,393
Hope.

565
02:01:48,520 --> 02:01:50,397
Brother.

566
02:02:40,520 --> 02:02:42,829
Keep us,

567
02:02:50,400 --> 02:02:52,118
guide us...

568
02:03:01,640 --> 02:03:03,915
till the end of time.

569
02:03:46,520 --> 02:03:48,476
[Young Jack] Follow me.

570
02:10:53,280 --> 02:10:54,998
I give him to you.

571
02:10:59,680 --> 02:11:01,398
I give you my son.
