1
00:00:47,439 --> 00:00:48,741
Detroit Police?

2
00:00:49,876 --> 00:00:52,745
There has been a theft in the museum.

3
00:00:57,315 --> 00:00:59,618
Chief, we've got Marcellus.

4
00:02:32,945 --> 00:02:34,113
Yo, let's go!

5
00:02:36,749 --> 00:02:39,886
Why are you such a stick in the mud?

6
00:02:41,419 --> 00:02:43,756
It's not just my scene, that's all.

7
00:02:43,823 --> 00:02:46,726
Why do you even want to hang out with me?

8
00:02:46,793 --> 00:02:49,427
You enjoy your Detroit friends so much better.

9
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:53,633
They don't matter like you do.

10
00:02:53,699 --> 00:02:55,600
- Even your mother was... - My mother?

11
00:02:56,601 --> 00:02:57,937
You gotta be kidding me.

12
00:02:58,004 --> 00:02:59,739
What the hell, man?

13
00:02:59,806 --> 00:03:01,606
Would you please stop?

14
00:03:01,674 --> 00:03:03,608
I can take care of myself.

15
00:03:03,676 --> 00:03:04,710
What is that?

16
00:03:04,777 --> 00:03:06,378
Stick in the mud.

17
00:03:10,149 --> 00:03:11,616
What was that?

18
00:03:12,718 --> 00:03:14,921
Did you hear that?

19
00:03:14,987 --> 00:03:16,856
Hey, come on out, you piece of shit.

20
00:03:17,657 --> 00:03:18,925
Rachelle, run!

21
00:03:47,954 --> 00:03:48,821
Mornin', Billie.

22
00:03:48,888 --> 00:03:50,555
Hell of a way to start a mornin'.

23
00:03:50,622 --> 00:03:51,891
Check in with Lieutenant Rossman.

24
00:03:51,958 --> 00:03:54,526
He'll get your assignment at the crime scene, okay?

25
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:01,868
What's with him?

26
00:04:01,934 --> 00:04:02,935
He's not a suspect.

27
00:04:03,002 --> 00:04:04,103
We already cleared him.

28
00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:06,105
But he's an asshole.

29
00:04:06,172 --> 00:04:07,039
I know.

30
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:21,053
Well, looky who it is.

31
00:04:23,256 --> 00:04:25,791
I ain't doin' a thing wrong, officer.

32
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:28,895
What you want, huh?

33
00:04:30,528 --> 00:04:32,832
You want to come look at my little girl's grave?

34
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:37,402
And how many times you been here since you got her killed?

35
00:04:38,771 --> 00:04:41,974
Oh, you got Brie all worked up about serving her country,

36
00:04:42,041 --> 00:04:44,076
left her poor mother at home to suffer.

37
00:04:44,143 --> 00:04:46,178
And now they're both fuckin' dead.

38
00:04:47,046 --> 00:04:48,413
Put the beer away, Cal.

39
00:04:49,949 --> 00:04:50,816
Go home.

40
00:05:49,141 --> 00:05:50,009
Finnick.

41
00:05:50,977 --> 00:05:51,844
You're up.

42
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:46,065
Major.

43
00:06:49,402 --> 00:06:51,037
Torch, this is Paladin.

44
00:06:51,103 --> 00:06:53,305
Paladin, this is Torch.

45
00:06:53,372 --> 00:06:54,673
We have the package.

46
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:01,747
No!

47
00:07:01,814 --> 00:07:04,784
No!

48
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:06,719
Let's go!

49
00:07:44,457 --> 00:07:45,791
I order you to breathe.

50
00:07:45,858 --> 00:07:47,126
Look, you cannot die.

51
00:07:47,193 --> 00:07:48,027
You cannot die.

52
00:07:48,094 --> 00:07:49,695
I need you here.

53
00:07:49,762 --> 00:07:50,696
I need you.

54
00:07:51,764 --> 00:07:53,966
I mean, your dad and, you know, Ellis.

55
00:07:54,033 --> 00:07:55,401
No no no.

56
00:07:55,468 --> 00:07:57,336
No, you breathe, dammit.

57
00:07:57,403 --> 00:07:59,004
Brie!

58
00:07:59,071 --> 00:08:00,039
Brie.

59
00:08:00,106 --> 00:08:03,342
Brie, no, look at me, look at me.

60
00:08:03,409 --> 00:08:04,810
Brie.

61
00:08:37,409 --> 00:08:39,812
Detectives, what've we got?

62
00:08:42,148 --> 00:08:45,351
We got Raj Dalal, 36 years old,

63
00:08:45,417 --> 00:08:47,186
Rachelle Winston's boyfriend,

64
00:08:47,253 --> 00:08:49,088
the girl whose body we found in the cemetery.

65
00:08:49,155 --> 00:08:50,022
Oh.

66
00:08:51,824 --> 00:08:53,259
Is he her killer?

67
00:08:53,325 --> 00:08:55,060
I don't know, Chief, but, uh,

68
00:08:56,428 --> 00:08:58,030
he's definitely hiding somethin'.

69
00:08:58,097 --> 00:09:00,900
I mean, wow.

70
00:09:02,234 --> 00:09:05,337
We got a call for a B and E, over at Cherrywood Estates.

71
00:09:06,372 --> 00:09:08,307
When we arrived on the location,

72
00:09:08,374 --> 00:09:11,877
we found Raj over here hiding in a woodshed.

73
00:09:11,944 --> 00:09:14,847
You think because maybe he whacked his girlfriend?

74
00:09:14,914 --> 00:09:16,148
Show him the piece, man.

75
00:09:17,383 --> 00:09:19,518
Found this little pea-shooter here.

76
00:09:19,585 --> 00:09:21,921
Didn't even take a single shot.

77
00:09:21,987 --> 00:09:23,289
You think he did it, Chief?

78
00:09:24,857 --> 00:09:25,724
No.

79
00:09:27,826 --> 00:09:29,862
Look at this guy.

80
00:09:29,929 --> 00:09:31,163
He's terrified in there.

81
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:32,865
He's about to piss himself.

82
00:09:32,932 --> 00:09:33,599
Definitely.

83
00:09:34,567 --> 00:09:36,335
I'm Detective O'Connor.

84
00:09:36,402 --> 00:09:38,437
This is Detective Alayoubi.

85
00:09:38,504 --> 00:09:40,973
We're with the Lake Orion PD.

86
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,776
We'd like to ask you a series of questions.

87
00:09:43,842 --> 00:09:46,445
Can you please state your name and age for the record?

88
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:49,949
Raj Dalal, 36.

89
00:09:50,015 --> 00:09:52,985
Raj, do you know why you're here?

90
00:09:53,052 --> 00:09:54,086
No.

91
00:09:54,153 --> 00:09:56,388
Can you tell me about Rachelle Winston?

92
00:09:56,455 --> 00:09:58,324
You were her boyfriend, right?

93
00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:00,859
We just hung out a couple of times.

94
00:10:00,926 --> 00:10:02,928
Let's take this step by step.

95
00:10:02,995 --> 00:10:04,263
Where were you, last night?

96
00:10:06,865 --> 00:10:08,467
You guys wouldn't believe me.

97
00:10:08,534 --> 00:10:10,102
Try us.

98
00:10:10,169 --> 00:10:11,270
We're the good guys.

99
00:10:13,973 --> 00:10:15,207
Whoa, whoa, whoa, slow down.

100
00:10:15,274 --> 00:10:16,041
English, please.

101
00:10:16,108 --> 00:10:18,712
I saw a devil, last night.

102
00:10:20,045 --> 00:10:22,948
We were just hanging out by, by the Oakwood Cemetery,

103
00:10:23,015 --> 00:10:25,150
and this creature, man, just came out of nowhere

104
00:10:25,217 --> 00:10:27,820
with glowing eyes, a tail,

105
00:10:27,886 --> 00:10:29,188
screams like a banshee.

106
00:10:31,457 --> 00:10:32,524
It killed her, man.

107
00:10:33,525 --> 00:10:35,928
They call it Nain Rouge.

108
00:10:35,995 --> 00:10:37,429
It killed her, man.

109
00:10:38,897 --> 00:10:39,832
It killed her.

110
00:10:39,898 --> 00:10:40,933
Whoa, whoa, whoa,

111
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,968
so you're telling me you saw a creature

112
00:10:43,035 --> 00:10:45,938
with glowing eyes and a tail?

113
00:10:46,005 --> 00:10:46,905
That's what you're telling me?

114
00:10:46,972 --> 00:10:47,806
Yes.

115
00:10:49,408 --> 00:10:51,343
You believe this fuckin' guy, partner?

116
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:58,083
Did you kill Rachelle Winston?

117
00:10:58,150 --> 00:11:01,320
No, I didn't kill, I didn't kill her.

118
00:11:02,354 --> 00:11:04,223
Nain Rouge killed her.

119
00:11:05,357 --> 00:11:06,292
Trust me.

120
00:11:06,358 --> 00:11:07,593
Trust you?

121
00:11:07,661 --> 00:11:09,461
I need a lawyer.

122
00:11:09,528 --> 00:11:11,530
That's the smartest thing you said all day, today.

123
00:11:11,597 --> 00:11:13,232
Thanks for wasting our time.

124
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,401
Get the fuck out.

125
00:11:38,957 --> 00:11:42,127
I didn't want her to go back down there.

126
00:11:42,194 --> 00:11:43,929
I tried to keep her here.

127
00:11:45,064 --> 00:11:47,333
I knew she was running with a bad crowd,

128
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:49,636
a real bad crowd.

129
00:11:49,703 --> 00:11:52,071
Had she been living in the city long?

130
00:11:52,137 --> 00:11:53,839
I, I think so.

131
00:11:55,607 --> 00:11:58,043
We haven't talked much in the past few months,

132
00:11:59,178 --> 00:12:00,245
not like we used to.

133
00:12:01,648 --> 00:12:04,149
She only comes around when she wants money.

134
00:12:04,216 --> 00:12:07,453
I just, I just couldn't talk to her anymore.

135
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:08,520
But the last time that she came,

136
00:12:08,587 --> 00:12:12,524
I felt like I, I had to make her stay.

137
00:12:15,194 --> 00:12:18,964
But she wouldn't listen.

138
00:12:19,031 --> 00:12:20,065
That was a week ago.

139
00:12:22,534 --> 00:12:23,502
And now she's gone.

140
00:12:24,403 --> 00:12:26,271
My little girl is gone.

141
00:12:27,239 --> 00:12:29,475
We'll find who did this, Wendy.

142
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:31,076
We'll find him.

143
00:12:49,395 --> 00:12:51,930
Don't tell me this is some contract hit, Chief.

144
00:12:53,465 --> 00:12:57,302
Billie Jean, you find me some witnesses,

145
00:12:57,369 --> 00:12:58,470
and I'll hear your case

146
00:12:58,537 --> 00:13:01,373
about some serial killer hiding up in the area.

147
00:13:02,675 --> 00:13:06,578
Until then, this is an inside hit.

148
00:13:06,646 --> 00:13:08,380
I'm sure of it,

149
00:13:08,447 --> 00:13:10,082
just like the one before.

150
00:13:11,216 --> 00:13:12,985
You heard Wendy.

151
00:13:13,051 --> 00:13:16,188
That girl was running around with a powerful city gang.

152
00:13:17,489 --> 00:13:19,491
Yeah, well, troubled kids in small towns do, sir.

153
00:13:19,558 --> 00:13:20,993
And I'm telling you,

154
00:13:21,059 --> 00:13:23,228
there's something bigger going on here.

155
00:13:23,295 --> 00:13:24,163
I feel it.

156
00:15:05,732 --> 00:15:07,065
Are you okay?

157
00:15:07,834 --> 00:15:10,302
It's a monster.

158
00:15:10,369 --> 00:15:11,236
It's here.

159
00:15:12,906 --> 00:15:15,642
It's living in the woods beyond my property.

160
00:15:15,708 --> 00:15:17,309
I saw it.

161
00:15:17,376 --> 00:15:18,477
Anna Lee, I am not the person

162
00:15:18,544 --> 00:15:21,213
to be acting like this in front of, all right?

163
00:15:21,881 --> 00:15:23,115
Come with me now.

164
00:15:23,181 --> 00:15:24,583
I'm gonna take you home, okay?

165
00:15:49,676 --> 00:15:51,510
I'm really not gonna be that man, I'm just sayin'.

166
00:15:51,577 --> 00:15:53,211
Finnick, what's up, sexy?

167
00:15:54,948 --> 00:15:56,716
Oh, shit.

168
00:15:56,783 --> 00:15:58,617
You're gonna get throat punched.

169
00:15:58,685 --> 00:16:00,285
And you're mean.

170
00:16:00,352 --> 00:16:01,420
Sit the fuck down.

171
00:16:01,486 --> 00:16:02,822
- Don't tell me to sit down. - Sit, troll.

172
00:16:02,889 --> 00:16:04,356
I'm sorry, Mom, Dad.

173
00:16:04,423 --> 00:16:05,490
Why, why?

174
00:16:06,626 --> 00:16:07,694
I'm not two.

175
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:08,795
Anyway.

176
00:16:08,861 --> 00:16:11,563
Finnick, I got the Winston case files.

177
00:16:12,431 --> 00:16:13,498
What do you think?

178
00:16:13,565 --> 00:16:15,200
You think it's a gang or something bigger?

179
00:16:16,301 --> 00:16:17,302
Something bigger?

180
00:16:17,369 --> 00:16:18,270
What could be bigger?

181
00:16:18,337 --> 00:16:20,707
All the stuff we've been through,

182
00:16:20,773 --> 00:16:22,274
we've seen some shit.

183
00:16:22,341 --> 00:16:23,843
Yeah, but that was war.

184
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:25,177
Okay, that wasn't here.

185
00:16:25,243 --> 00:16:28,447
At least in war, you know who your enemy is and why.

186
00:16:29,581 --> 00:16:31,283
And you don't think that can happen here?

187
00:16:33,385 --> 00:16:35,420
Desperate times, desperate measures?

188
00:16:37,356 --> 00:16:38,390
Have you ever heard of the Nain Rouge?

189
00:16:40,392 --> 00:16:41,393
Yeah, I think we have.

190
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:42,762
I mean, we have a witness back there

191
00:16:42,829 --> 00:16:45,330
that I fucking just beamed his head off the damn table,

192
00:16:45,397 --> 00:16:46,933
talkin' about a little red devil,

193
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,701
pointy ears, long tail, yeah.

194
00:16:48,768 --> 00:16:49,636
He's full of shit.

195
00:16:49,702 --> 00:16:51,470
What, you believe it?

196
00:16:51,536 --> 00:16:52,805
I don't believe any of it.

197
00:16:52,872 --> 00:16:53,740
You don't believe it?

198
00:16:53,806 --> 00:16:55,307
No.

199
00:16:55,374 --> 00:16:57,476
I mean, I'm not saying I believe it.

200
00:16:57,542 --> 00:16:58,543
But there's a lot of coincidence

201
00:16:58,610 --> 00:17:00,947
and a lot of talk around town about it.

202
00:17:01,014 --> 00:17:04,349
That doesn't mean I believe in demons and monsters.

203
00:17:04,416 --> 00:17:06,618
We need to get to the bottom of this, okay?

204
00:17:06,686 --> 00:17:08,487
I believe we need to figure it out.

205
00:17:10,355 --> 00:17:11,024
We're on it.

206
00:17:11,090 --> 00:17:12,157
Get to work, ladies.

207
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:15,527
She's fuckin' high.

208
00:17:29,976 --> 00:17:31,678
Officer, officer!

209
00:17:31,744 --> 00:17:32,879
Officer, you need to get over there.

210
00:17:32,945 --> 00:17:34,212
This motherfucker killed somebody.

211
00:17:34,279 --> 00:17:35,213
- You guys called this in? - Yeah, we called it in.

212
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,050
- All right. - There's a motherfucker

213
00:17:37,116 --> 00:17:38,151
and dragged the body back there.

214
00:17:38,216 --> 00:17:39,184
- Calm down. - There's blood everywhere.

215
00:17:39,251 --> 00:17:40,318
Calm down, tell me what you saw.

216
00:17:40,385 --> 00:17:42,621
A man just dragged his body back there.

217
00:17:42,689 --> 00:17:43,656
There's blood in the back of the chapel.

218
00:17:43,723 --> 00:17:44,824
There's freakin' blood everywhere.

219
00:17:44,891 --> 00:17:45,424
It looked like Hannibal Lecter and some shit.

220
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:46,258
Okay, where?

221
00:17:46,324 --> 00:17:48,427
He just dragged him inside.

222
00:17:48,493 --> 00:17:49,494
- It's everywhere. - Look, I'm from Detroit,

223
00:17:49,561 --> 00:17:50,562
and I ain't never seen shit like that.

224
00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:51,229
- Where? - In the back of the chapel.

225
00:17:51,296 --> 00:17:51,831
Stay right here.

226
00:18:29,836 --> 00:18:34,841
Freeze!

227
00:18:36,709 --> 00:18:37,576
Shit.

228
00:18:39,979 --> 00:18:41,080
Radio 502.

229
00:18:43,049 --> 00:18:44,951
I've got an active homicide at this location.

230
00:18:45,017 --> 00:18:48,487
Back-up units, right now.

231
00:18:54,627 --> 00:18:56,028
Oh my gosh, Billie, you okay?

232
00:18:56,095 --> 00:18:56,863
Yeah, I'm good.

233
00:18:56,929 --> 00:18:57,997
You had shots fired there.

234
00:18:58,064 --> 00:18:59,564
Yeah, three of 'em.

235
00:18:59,632 --> 00:19:00,900
And I know I hit him.

236
00:19:02,034 --> 00:19:05,337
Chief, it's been years since the last homicide.

237
00:19:06,404 --> 00:19:07,874
I've never seen anything this brutal,

238
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:09,474
not even in combat.

239
00:19:22,554 --> 00:19:24,589
Hey, DJ Godfather, what's up, man?

240
00:19:24,657 --> 00:19:25,892
Hey, what up, man?

241
00:19:25,958 --> 00:19:27,559
Have you seen this guy?

242
00:19:27,627 --> 00:19:28,761
Yeah, he's a regular.

243
00:19:28,828 --> 00:19:30,562
Corner booth, right over there.

244
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:31,697
I fuckin' knew it.

245
00:19:31,764 --> 00:19:32,597
Come on, let's go.

246
00:19:43,709 --> 00:19:44,476
When's the last time

247
00:19:44,543 --> 00:19:46,679
you played with pyrotechnics?

248
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:50,582
You know, I was really starting to get to know her.

249
00:19:50,650 --> 00:19:51,951
Really don't give a shit.

250
00:19:52,985 --> 00:19:55,121
She's an art history major.

251
00:19:55,188 --> 00:19:58,390
What do you know about a crackhead named Ike?

252
00:20:01,627 --> 00:20:03,696
I think both of you are way out of your jurisdiction.

253
00:20:03,763 --> 00:20:05,865
Can you believe this fuckin' guy?

254
00:20:05,932 --> 00:20:07,133
Don't worry, Marcellus,

255
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,734
we already filled out our deconfliction report.

256
00:20:12,504 --> 00:20:13,505
I'm not gonna have the answers

257
00:20:13,572 --> 00:20:15,675
for the questions you're gonna ask.

258
00:20:15,741 --> 00:20:18,510
Neither of you have any idea who

259
00:20:18,577 --> 00:20:20,680
or what you are fucking with.

260
00:20:20,746 --> 00:20:23,749
I don't give a shit about your daddy.

261
00:20:23,816 --> 00:20:24,616
You understand that?

262
00:20:24,684 --> 00:20:26,451
Look at me, I don't give a shit.

263
00:20:26,518 --> 00:20:28,453
It's got nothing to do with him.

264
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:29,554
What are you gonna do,

265
00:20:29,621 --> 00:20:30,422
tell us a story about a little red devil?

266
00:20:30,488 --> 00:20:31,356
- What the... - Whoa, whoa!

267
00:20:31,423 --> 00:20:34,827
Don't be stupid, don't be stupid.

268
00:20:34,894 --> 00:20:36,028
- Who told you? - Walk away.

269
00:20:47,907 --> 00:20:49,675
- Hey, Billie. - Hey.

270
00:20:54,512 --> 00:20:56,048
- Hey, Billie. - Hey.

271
00:20:59,785 --> 00:21:00,653
You called, Chief?

272
00:21:01,787 --> 00:21:04,456
Hey, Billie, come on in and have a seat.

273
00:21:04,522 --> 00:21:07,126
Give you one guess where our victim's from.

274
00:21:07,193 --> 00:21:12,098
25-year-old male, low-level hood rat,

275
00:21:12,164 --> 00:21:15,001
runs around with a group called, you ready for it?

276
00:21:15,067 --> 00:21:17,703
The Corpses, kinda fitting now, isn't it?

277
00:21:18,638 --> 00:21:20,907
This is guy is a wanted felon,

278
00:21:20,973 --> 00:21:24,043
wanted for weapons and firearms violations.

279
00:21:24,110 --> 00:21:25,111
He's got a criminal history

280
00:21:25,177 --> 00:21:27,914
you could wallpaper your bathroom with.

281
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:30,082
What do we say about these guys around town, Billie?

282
00:21:30,149 --> 00:21:31,549
Play stupid games...

283
00:21:31,616 --> 00:21:33,551
Win stupid prizes.

284
00:21:33,618 --> 00:21:35,587
What the hell is he doing out here?

285
00:21:35,655 --> 00:21:37,723
No clue, but this much I know,

286
00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:39,258
whatever he was doin',

287
00:21:39,325 --> 00:21:40,693
he's not doin' it no more.

288
00:21:41,894 --> 00:21:45,497
Probably a contract hit, inter-gang violence,

289
00:21:45,563 --> 00:21:46,999
but somebody wanted him removed.

290
00:21:48,134 --> 00:21:49,467
Is the city gonna get involved?

291
00:21:49,534 --> 00:21:53,105
No, the city doesn't give two shits about a guy like this.

292
00:21:53,172 --> 00:21:55,074
He runs out of their city and comes to ours

293
00:21:55,141 --> 00:21:57,910
and gets murdered, the only thing they care about,

294
00:21:57,977 --> 00:21:59,278
he's off their radar.

295
00:21:59,345 --> 00:22:00,846
The mutilated that man.

296
00:22:02,281 --> 00:22:04,582
There's no way that was some ordinary hit.

297
00:22:04,650 --> 00:22:06,886
It wasn't an ordinary hit, Billie.

298
00:22:06,953 --> 00:22:08,821
He was mutilated.

299
00:22:08,888 --> 00:22:12,058
But the one thing you have to remember, your focus,

300
00:22:12,124 --> 00:22:14,592
your attention is that we have our own people,

301
00:22:15,728 --> 00:22:17,663
and with that, our own problems.

302
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:23,736
Are we done?

303
00:22:23,803 --> 00:22:27,173
We are, just read the case and know the file.

304
00:22:27,239 --> 00:22:28,140
Yes, Chief.

305
00:25:03,329 --> 00:25:05,097
Please accept these special shell-casings

306
00:25:05,164 --> 00:25:07,032
as a reminder of this shot volley

307
00:25:07,099 --> 00:25:08,234
in honor of your daughter's commitment

308
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:11,170
to our freedom, by entering the Armed Forces.

309
00:25:53,445 --> 00:25:54,480
If you have any questions,

310
00:25:54,547 --> 00:25:56,315
the court phone number's on the bottom.

311
00:25:56,382 --> 00:25:57,316
Have a better day.

312
00:26:11,997 --> 00:26:13,866
Radio 502, cleared traffic.

313
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:35,854
Pastor Wilhem, how are you today?

314
00:26:35,921 --> 00:26:38,157
Officer Finnick, I'm good, thank you.

315
00:26:39,291 --> 00:26:43,395
As always, I feel the current temperament

316
00:26:44,296 --> 00:26:45,798
of the people of Lake Orion,

317
00:26:46,932 --> 00:26:49,735
but today, as in the past few days,

318
00:26:51,971 --> 00:26:53,372
we're very concerned

319
00:26:53,439 --> 00:26:55,074
and especially frustrated.

320
00:26:57,142 --> 00:26:59,345
Is there anything I can say to the congregation,

321
00:26:59,411 --> 00:27:03,882
any news at all, about this sordid mess,

322
00:27:05,017 --> 00:27:06,585
the accident that took several lives,

323
00:27:06,653 --> 00:27:09,154
even of someone not so innocent?

324
00:27:09,221 --> 00:27:11,523
Well, you know, we share in your frustration, Pastor.

325
00:27:12,626 --> 00:27:13,959
This definitely wasn't an accident.

326
00:27:14,026 --> 00:27:15,894
It's been ruled a homicide.

327
00:27:15,961 --> 00:27:19,231
And we are currently pursuing all leads for suspects.

328
00:27:19,298 --> 00:27:24,303
Aside from the low-income crime which we deal with here,

329
00:27:25,604 --> 00:27:28,807
the last thing our youth needs

330
00:27:30,175 --> 00:27:33,045
is the immeasurable negative impact

331
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:37,216
of the gang activity and the drug abuse and the prostitution

332
00:27:38,550 --> 00:27:41,287
which runs rampant in that horrible place.

333
00:29:12,478 --> 00:29:13,345
Mulder.

334
00:29:14,346 --> 00:29:15,981
Mulder.

335
00:29:47,413 --> 00:29:48,280
Major?

336
00:29:50,382 --> 00:29:52,117
Now that's a voice I haven't heard from,

337
00:29:52,184 --> 00:29:53,986
in a long time.

338
00:29:54,052 --> 00:29:56,155
What can I do for you, Finnick?

339
00:29:56,221 --> 00:29:58,390
I've got big trouble in a small town, sir.

340
00:30:31,825 --> 00:30:33,025
Thank you, officers.

341
00:30:33,091 --> 00:30:37,129
Please follow me right this way to the crime scene.

342
00:30:46,605 --> 00:30:49,141
This is our Native American exhibit,

343
00:30:49,208 --> 00:30:50,976
where the crime was initiated.

344
00:30:53,111 --> 00:30:54,446
Will you follow me to the concourse?

345
00:30:54,513 --> 00:30:55,347
Sure.

346
00:31:01,386 --> 00:31:05,658
You know, Dr. Sudhir is curator, of course,

347
00:31:05,725 --> 00:31:09,194
and, um, he knows a lot about this situation,

348
00:31:09,261 --> 00:31:12,331
and he could probably explain it better than I.

349
00:31:14,466 --> 00:31:17,704
I keep an eye on our city's most important artifacts.

350
00:31:17,770 --> 00:31:19,471
But something's slipped through the cracks,

351
00:31:19,538 --> 00:31:20,472
from what I understand.

352
00:31:22,608 --> 00:31:27,079
Oh, yes, a most unfortunate crime.

353
00:31:27,145 --> 00:31:31,283
It was done close to around midnight, well planned.

354
00:31:33,218 --> 00:31:35,187
Nightingale, what does this have to do with Lake Orion?

355
00:31:36,288 --> 00:31:39,358
It's fear, officer, fear of pain,

356
00:31:39,424 --> 00:31:42,127
fear of death, fear of the unknown,

357
00:31:43,462 --> 00:31:45,732
were you to have this here knife,

358
00:31:47,366 --> 00:31:49,201
and others saw possibilities.

359
00:31:51,738 --> 00:31:53,640
I'm not following.

360
00:31:53,706 --> 00:31:58,544
The knife is a weapon that was forged in fire and blood,

361
00:31:58,610 --> 00:32:01,280
by the Native Americans, South Michigan.

362
00:32:02,581 --> 00:32:06,285
Chief Pontiac himself carved the knife from the bone

363
00:32:06,351 --> 00:32:09,822
of the wolf that was killed by a French soldier.

364
00:32:10,857 --> 00:32:12,491
The knife in question was a weapon

365
00:32:12,558 --> 00:32:13,893
of the Ottawa Indian tribe

366
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:16,663
who prospered like thousands of years ago,

367
00:32:16,729 --> 00:32:18,765
in and around the area we're standing on, today.

368
00:32:18,831 --> 00:32:23,235
Now the knife is said to endow the one who holds it

369
00:32:23,302 --> 00:32:27,372
with a protector, a ruthless guardian angel.

370
00:32:27,439 --> 00:32:29,608
And it would give them warning,

371
00:32:29,676 --> 00:32:33,345
share the land and take only what you need

372
00:32:33,412 --> 00:32:36,749
and do not destroy to live, or else.

373
00:32:37,850 --> 00:32:39,786
Unfortunately for those French settlers,

374
00:32:41,888 --> 00:32:45,792
our great city, they did not heed the words

375
00:32:45,858 --> 00:32:49,696
of what they called the Nain Rouge,

376
00:32:49,762 --> 00:32:53,098
and Detroit has suffered for it, ever since.

377
00:32:53,967 --> 00:32:56,368
If you are holding the knife,

378
00:32:56,435 --> 00:32:58,537
it may even come for you.

379
00:32:58,604 --> 00:33:02,574
But if you are not the one who summoned it,

380
00:33:02,642 --> 00:33:03,676
it will kill you.

381
00:33:04,576 --> 00:33:06,311
So be warned.

382
00:33:06,378 --> 00:33:10,482
You may only have this one chance to stop it.

383
00:33:11,651 --> 00:33:13,686
The book suggests

384
00:33:13,753 --> 00:33:15,788
that one has to strike the knife

385
00:33:16,923 --> 00:33:20,325
in the back of its neck, to banish it.

386
00:33:25,263 --> 00:33:26,866
It makes sense.

387
00:33:26,933 --> 00:33:28,835
You know, a couple of months ago,

388
00:33:30,670 --> 00:33:33,740
there was a murder, particularly gruesome murder,

389
00:33:33,806 --> 00:33:35,307
top-tier gangster.

390
00:33:37,376 --> 00:33:40,312
He hadn't been shot, stabbed, tortured,

391
00:33:40,379 --> 00:33:41,580
nothing like that.

392
00:33:42,715 --> 00:33:45,752
He'd been torn to shreds, Finnick.

393
00:33:45,818 --> 00:33:47,285
I mean torn to shreds.

394
00:33:48,054 --> 00:33:50,522
Man, after that,

395
00:33:52,324 --> 00:33:53,191
every other day,

396
00:33:54,259 --> 00:33:57,529
four or five times a week, same thing.

397
00:33:58,698 --> 00:34:03,402
That knife was used to summon a demon.

398
00:34:04,302 --> 00:34:05,772
Who would summon this thing?

399
00:34:05,838 --> 00:34:06,939
Why?

400
00:34:07,006 --> 00:34:08,141
Who knows?

401
00:34:08,206 --> 00:34:10,375
I mean, payback, somebody wants to get even,

402
00:34:10,442 --> 00:34:11,744
right a wrong, I don't know,

403
00:34:11,811 --> 00:34:15,648
but what I do know is this thing has gotten out of hand,

404
00:34:15,715 --> 00:34:18,350
and we have to find that knife.

405
00:35:19,779 --> 00:35:20,646
Hello.

406
00:35:22,481 --> 00:35:23,916
Who is this?

407
00:35:23,983 --> 00:35:26,585
Wait, wait, wait, hold on, calm down.

408
00:35:26,652 --> 00:35:29,321
Calm down, look, lower your voice, lower your voice.

409
00:35:29,387 --> 00:35:30,489
Where the fuck are you?

410
00:36:00,552 --> 00:36:02,989
I had this, this gorgeous, this, this,

411
00:36:03,055 --> 00:36:05,423
this beautiful turkey sandwich

412
00:36:05,490 --> 00:36:06,759
with all the trimmings.

413
00:36:06,826 --> 00:36:10,428
I'm talkin' about lettuce, tomatoes, yellow peppers,

414
00:36:11,563 --> 00:36:14,000
a little hint of salt and pepper, mayo.

415
00:36:14,066 --> 00:36:15,668
And this wasn't some supermarket,

416
00:36:15,735 --> 00:36:18,370
thin-cut slice of processed bullshit.

417
00:36:18,436 --> 00:36:19,772
This that thick-cut turkey,

418
00:36:19,839 --> 00:36:21,540
the kind they get me from Canada.

419
00:36:21,606 --> 00:36:23,109
Talk about a trade deal.

420
00:36:23,176 --> 00:36:24,811
So what do I do?

421
00:36:24,877 --> 00:36:27,747
I wrap it up, and I put it in the refrigerator.

422
00:36:28,881 --> 00:36:31,017
But you know that shit's not gonna hold, right?

423
00:36:31,083 --> 00:36:32,317
I wouldn't have called you out here

424
00:36:32,384 --> 00:36:33,418
- if it wasn't serious. - Lettuce gonna get all moist.

425
00:36:33,485 --> 00:36:36,656
Bread's gonna soak up part of the mayo.

426
00:36:36,722 --> 00:36:38,024
I don't take it with me,

427
00:36:38,090 --> 00:36:41,961
'cause I don't wanna risk spilling it on my $3,000 suit,

428
00:36:42,028 --> 00:36:45,865
but when my son calls, I drop everything, don't I?

429
00:36:47,733 --> 00:36:49,669
Listen, some serious shit is gonna go down...

430
00:36:49,735 --> 00:36:52,004
Don't say another goddamned word.

431
00:36:53,739 --> 00:36:54,941
I only got less than one week

432
00:36:55,007 --> 00:36:56,843
before I put all my ducks in a row,

433
00:36:56,909 --> 00:36:59,045
and you're just a duck waitin' to quack.

434
00:36:59,111 --> 00:37:00,213
What, you think I'm gonna go out there

435
00:37:00,279 --> 00:37:01,948
and start tellin' everybody about what we do?

436
00:37:02,014 --> 00:37:02,982
- You fuck up... - I'm gonna sacrifice...

437
00:37:03,049 --> 00:37:05,785
And you fuck up, and you fuck up,

438
00:37:05,852 --> 00:37:07,419
and I handle it, don't I?

439
00:37:08,553 --> 00:37:09,621
You were supposed to be right by my side,

440
00:37:09,689 --> 00:37:12,692
standing right next to me, father and son.

441
00:37:12,758 --> 00:37:14,559
I mean, hell, we could've been.

442
00:37:14,627 --> 00:37:15,962
- But here we are, right? - It's another lifetime.

443
00:37:16,028 --> 00:37:17,830
Time and time, again.

444
00:37:17,897 --> 00:37:19,098
This time, it's different.

445
00:37:19,165 --> 00:37:20,532
Oh, it is?

446
00:37:20,599 --> 00:37:21,701
Listen, some heavy shit is about

447
00:37:21,767 --> 00:37:22,802
to happen in your jurisdiction.

448
00:37:22,869 --> 00:37:23,636
I need your help.

449
00:37:23,703 --> 00:37:24,937
Let me tell you something.

450
00:37:25,004 --> 00:37:28,440
Me meetin' you here, in this town, in this place,

451
00:37:28,506 --> 00:37:31,443
I mean, wow, you must've really fucked up royally.

452
00:37:36,215 --> 00:37:37,917
I came here to meet you face to face,

453
00:37:37,984 --> 00:37:38,951
to tell you one more time,

454
00:37:39,018 --> 00:37:39,952
that you not gettin' no more favors

455
00:37:40,019 --> 00:37:43,823
from dear, old Dad, nothing, nada.

456
00:37:43,890 --> 00:37:44,991
We're done.

457
00:37:45,057 --> 00:37:47,059
That's what you drove all the way here for?

458
00:37:47,126 --> 00:37:48,661
I'm gonna be watchin' you.

459
00:37:50,062 --> 00:37:53,132
And if you ever dare to speak about what I've done for you,

460
00:37:53,199 --> 00:37:55,101
boy, oh, boy, it's gonna be crucial.

461
00:37:56,636 --> 00:37:58,070
Welcome back to channel eight, "Talk Detroit."

462
00:37:58,137 --> 00:37:59,138
I'm Jay Towers.

463
00:37:59,205 --> 00:38:00,940
Here with us now is Sheriff John Wayne.

464
00:38:01,007 --> 00:38:02,607
Sheriff, thanks for being here today.

465
00:38:02,675 --> 00:38:03,910
Jay, thanks for having me.

466
00:38:03,976 --> 00:38:07,980
Recently, reports of a number of gruesome murders

467
00:38:08,047 --> 00:38:11,684
in the Lake Orion area have left many residents worried

468
00:38:11,751 --> 00:38:13,052
about their safety.

469
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:15,988
Over the past few months, police have been tracking two men

470
00:38:16,055 --> 00:38:18,523
on charges of kidnapping and armed robbery.

471
00:38:18,590 --> 00:38:21,761
Both of the suspects were recently found dead

472
00:38:21,827 --> 00:38:24,163
in what some Lake Orion residents are seeing

473
00:38:24,230 --> 00:38:26,966
as a form of street justice.

474
00:38:31,237 --> 00:38:32,772
Now where did this all start?

475
00:38:32,838 --> 00:38:34,539
Well, we have a few open cases

476
00:38:34,606 --> 00:38:36,175
from Detroit, going back a few months,

477
00:38:36,242 --> 00:38:39,245
and we've linked that to this unknown assailant.

478
00:38:39,312 --> 00:38:41,513
So is it safe for us to assume

479
00:38:41,579 --> 00:38:43,015
that this is the work of an individual

480
00:38:43,082 --> 00:38:44,616
and not a group of people?

481
00:38:44,684 --> 00:38:46,218
Well, we're seeing a similar pattern,

482
00:38:46,285 --> 00:38:47,552
an M.O., if you will,

483
00:38:47,619 --> 00:38:50,923
and details have emerged that link this all together.

484
00:38:50,990 --> 00:38:53,759
Our investigation has kinda led us down the path

485
00:38:53,826 --> 00:38:56,862
to believe we're looking at a single suspect.

486
00:38:56,929 --> 00:38:58,998
You know, there was another gruesome death,

487
00:38:59,065 --> 00:39:00,299
last week, in Old Town.

488
00:39:00,366 --> 00:39:03,769
The victim was part of a group called The Corpses.

489
00:39:03,836 --> 00:39:04,904
Have you heard of them?

490
00:39:04,971 --> 00:39:06,571
Oh, yeah, we're familiar with them.

491
00:39:06,639 --> 00:39:07,873
Any connection there?

492
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:09,241
Perhaps, it would seem to fit the pattern,

493
00:39:09,308 --> 00:39:12,144
but at this point, I would say nothing's been confirmed.

494
00:39:12,211 --> 00:39:14,180
Some residents are hypothesizing...

495
00:39:14,246 --> 00:39:15,681
Staff Sergeant Finnick.

496
00:39:17,283 --> 00:39:19,218
Trade in uniforms, huh?

497
00:39:20,753 --> 00:39:21,821
Well, I failed at the last one,

498
00:39:21,887 --> 00:39:24,991
so maybe I can right my wrongs, this time.

499
00:39:25,925 --> 00:39:26,792
Please stop.

500
00:39:28,194 --> 00:39:29,862
Why do you do that to yourself?

501
00:39:31,030 --> 00:39:33,766
You know you had nothing to do with Brie's death.

502
00:39:33,833 --> 00:39:36,635
I had everything to do with it.

503
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:43,976
Look, you got to stop blaming yourself.

504
00:39:44,043 --> 00:39:45,244
You need to move past it.

505
00:39:47,413 --> 00:39:49,849
You cannot harbor the resentment.

506
00:39:53,386 --> 00:39:54,586
I was her NCO.

507
00:39:54,653 --> 00:39:57,056
I was supposed to protect her, and I, I didn't.

508
00:39:58,391 --> 00:39:59,492
I don't care about labels, okay.

509
00:39:59,557 --> 00:40:02,194
I don't care what your name is in the Army.

510
00:40:02,261 --> 00:40:03,863
You guys have been inseparable

511
00:40:04,964 --> 00:40:06,866
since you were little kids.

512
00:40:06,932 --> 00:40:08,000
We grew up together.

513
00:40:09,335 --> 00:40:12,071
You guys went over there fighting for the same thing.

514
00:40:13,172 --> 00:40:17,943
Blood everywhere, totally killed my buzz.

515
00:40:18,010 --> 00:40:18,778
It was crazy, man.

516
00:40:18,844 --> 00:40:19,812
Can you believe this shit?

517
00:40:19,879 --> 00:40:20,612
Yeah, he was hanging upside down,

518
00:40:20,679 --> 00:40:22,181
like a bat in an alleyway.

519
00:40:22,248 --> 00:40:23,449
You gotta do something.

520
00:40:23,516 --> 00:40:24,549
You gotta hide your wives and hide your kids.

521
00:40:24,616 --> 00:40:27,353
You know, the Nain Rouge is gonna get you.

522
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:30,990
Some residents are hypothesizing that something animal

523
00:40:31,057 --> 00:40:33,626
or inhuman was responsible for these deaths.

524
00:40:33,692 --> 00:40:36,028
I mean, is there anything to that?

525
00:40:36,095 --> 00:40:37,930
You know, given the injuries to these victims,

526
00:40:37,997 --> 00:40:40,866
I understand how people are jumping to those conclusions,

527
00:40:40,933 --> 00:40:42,101
and we're not ruling anything out.

528
00:40:42,168 --> 00:40:45,037
But I would say, definitively, we're not looking

529
00:40:45,104 --> 00:40:48,174
for some kind of creature of folklore.

530
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:50,743
You know anything about it?

531
00:40:50,810 --> 00:40:51,644
No.

532
00:40:53,212 --> 00:40:55,848
No, if I see something, I'll say something.

533
00:40:55,915 --> 00:40:58,784
You'll be the first to know.

534
00:40:58,851 --> 00:41:00,019
What about you?

535
00:41:00,986 --> 00:41:02,822
Not a damn thing.

536
00:41:02,888 --> 00:41:03,889
Nothin' makes sense.

537
00:41:05,891 --> 00:41:07,226
Yeah, apparently.

538
00:41:09,361 --> 00:41:10,729
I saw your dad, today.

539
00:41:14,266 --> 00:41:17,203
I guess that's why you haven't been around yet, huh?

540
00:41:17,269 --> 00:41:18,804
Where at?

541
00:41:18,871 --> 00:41:20,005
Just while I was out.

542
00:41:21,273 --> 00:41:22,341
I love my father,

543
00:41:24,510 --> 00:41:26,946
but he can be a real piece of shit, sometimes.

544
00:41:27,947 --> 00:41:29,048
And I'm sorry for that.

545
00:41:31,417 --> 00:41:33,919
He loved me like you guys, you and Brie.

546
00:41:41,060 --> 00:41:42,461
Come on, Penny.

547
00:41:42,528 --> 00:41:44,096
Come on, come on.

548
00:41:44,163 --> 00:41:44,997
Watch your step.

549
00:41:46,398 --> 00:41:48,334
Welcome to the Palace of Solitude.

550
00:41:53,405 --> 00:41:56,008
Wow, this looks totally different.

551
00:41:57,943 --> 00:42:00,379
Well, you know, my dad's not around that much anymore.

552
00:42:02,248 --> 00:42:03,382
Made it my own.

553
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:09,922
But it's a living.

554
00:42:14,026 --> 00:42:15,027
They're beautiful.

555
00:42:18,130 --> 00:42:19,331
What happened?

556
00:42:19,398 --> 00:42:21,066
You were never this forthcoming when we were kids.

557
00:42:22,034 --> 00:42:23,269
Well, it took me a while,

558
00:42:23,335 --> 00:42:25,838
gettin' comfortable with being an artist, you know.

559
00:42:25,905 --> 00:42:28,707
I mean, the whole time I was in the city, it was tough.

560
00:42:30,242 --> 00:42:32,912
It's not a place to get your head straight.

561
00:42:32,978 --> 00:42:37,116
And then my mom died, and I was at the point

562
00:42:37,183 --> 00:42:39,985
where I couldn't see any end, no tomorrow.

563
00:42:41,220 --> 00:42:44,256
I, uh, kinda got lost in drugs,

564
00:42:45,958 --> 00:42:46,926
got really violent.

565
00:42:49,361 --> 00:42:51,130
I almost didn't make it out alive.

566
00:42:53,098 --> 00:42:56,001
Wow, this is all such a surprise to me.

567
00:42:57,002 --> 00:42:57,836
Yeah.

568
00:42:59,371 --> 00:43:01,774
Yeah, coming back home was the only move I had.

569
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:02,942
I'm still working on my dad,

570
00:43:03,008 --> 00:43:05,177
but with the pastor's help, we'll get there.

571
00:43:05,244 --> 00:43:06,312
Pastor Wilhem?

572
00:43:06,378 --> 00:43:08,080
Yeah, he's a lifesaver.

573
00:43:20,092 --> 00:43:20,993
Starsky and Hutch.

574
00:43:21,060 --> 00:43:21,860
What's up, Chief?

575
00:43:21,927 --> 00:43:23,729
Just the guys I'm lookin' for.

576
00:43:24,930 --> 00:43:26,198
How you doin'?

577
00:43:27,566 --> 00:43:29,902
Hey, we got a positive ID on that guy you were chasing

578
00:43:29,969 --> 00:43:31,237
through the woods, last night.

579
00:43:31,303 --> 00:43:32,338
Yeah, what the fuck happened, last night?

580
00:43:32,404 --> 00:43:33,138
Nothing good.

581
00:43:33,205 --> 00:43:34,940
It's a Marcellus De Vaux.

582
00:43:35,007 --> 00:43:36,742
He's a local shithead, you know.

583
00:43:38,444 --> 00:43:41,113
Did you just say Marcellus De Vaux?

584
00:43:41,180 --> 00:43:42,348
I been chasin' this piece of shit

585
00:43:42,414 --> 00:43:44,216
for the past couple of years.

586
00:43:44,283 --> 00:43:47,086
Well, now's our chance, but here's the thing.

587
00:43:47,152 --> 00:43:50,089
He's very well connected with Mayor Flynn.

588
00:43:50,155 --> 00:43:52,024
Chief, mayor or no mayor,

589
00:43:52,091 --> 00:43:53,859
I don't give a fuck who his daddy is.

590
00:43:53,926 --> 00:43:56,362
I get it, I get it, but this is a minefield.

591
00:43:56,428 --> 00:43:59,365
I need you guys to get his ass, but step easy

592
00:43:59,431 --> 00:44:00,833
and don't blow anything up, okay?

593
00:44:00,899 --> 00:44:02,234
Yes, sir.

594
00:44:02,301 --> 00:44:03,102
Come on, baby, oh.

595
00:44:07,473 --> 00:44:09,475
It's almost ready, baby.

596
00:44:12,444 --> 00:44:14,146
Hey, hey, Ike.

597
00:44:15,447 --> 00:44:16,782
It's me, Simon.

598
00:44:18,284 --> 00:44:19,151
Ike?

599
00:44:20,619 --> 00:44:21,887
Guess what day it is.

600
00:44:23,289 --> 00:44:24,890
It's Devil's Night.

601
00:44:27,627 --> 00:44:29,261
That's right.

602
00:44:37,069 --> 00:44:39,538
You look like the cat that ate the canary.

603
00:44:41,106 --> 00:44:42,875
What the fuck brings you here?

604
00:44:42,941 --> 00:44:43,609
Hi.

605
00:44:45,712 --> 00:44:47,112
Can I get you anything?

606
00:44:48,147 --> 00:44:49,415
Beer, cigarette?

607
00:44:51,617 --> 00:44:53,653
How 'bout your decorator's phone number?

608
00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:55,154
Ah, don't be a dick.

609
00:44:56,488 --> 00:44:58,357
No, but seriously, what brings you here?

610
00:44:59,591 --> 00:45:02,261
I need something small, packs a punch,

611
00:45:03,329 --> 00:45:04,296
something that goes bang.

612
00:45:08,100 --> 00:45:09,568
Well, I would offer up Candy over here,

613
00:45:09,636 --> 00:45:11,170
but she's all mine.

614
00:45:12,471 --> 00:45:14,473
You wanna help him out, babe?

615
00:45:14,540 --> 00:45:15,441
Right this way.

616
00:45:19,011 --> 00:45:20,245
I'll be right with you.

617
00:45:25,117 --> 00:45:26,618
You seen the newspapers?

618
00:45:26,686 --> 00:45:28,120
You seen the front pages?

619
00:45:29,621 --> 00:45:31,890
Five deaths in 24 hours.

620
00:45:32,659 --> 00:45:34,360
I don't give a fuck.

621
00:45:34,426 --> 00:45:37,996
Yeah, well, two of them were your own men.

622
00:45:40,633 --> 00:45:44,570
Listen, man, I don't know how the hell they do it

623
00:45:44,637 --> 00:45:48,340
down there in Pine Barrens, New Jersey,

624
00:45:48,407 --> 00:45:50,409
but here in Lake Orion,

625
00:45:51,510 --> 00:45:53,112
we gotta take care of our own.

626
00:46:00,252 --> 00:46:02,388
Is this what you wanted?

627
00:46:04,657 --> 00:46:05,457
Looks like it.

628
00:46:05,524 --> 00:46:07,226
Let me see if it's all here.

629
00:46:07,292 --> 00:46:08,961
Oh, it's all there.

630
00:46:10,229 --> 00:46:11,463
You know, Candy, you're worth a lot more

631
00:46:11,530 --> 00:46:12,998
than Ike has to offer.

632
00:46:13,065 --> 00:46:16,669
Ah, this, it's working for me right now.

633
00:46:19,639 --> 00:46:23,008
Well, just make sure that you remember,

634
00:46:23,075 --> 00:46:25,645
you got a long life ahead of you.

635
00:49:20,820 --> 00:49:23,221
Report in, sector five.

636
00:49:23,288 --> 00:49:24,489
Come here, guys.

637
00:49:28,427 --> 00:49:29,428
Chief Pender!

638
00:49:29,494 --> 00:49:30,763
Chief, what've you got, man?

639
00:49:30,830 --> 00:49:31,731
Looks like a meth lab.

640
00:49:31,798 --> 00:49:32,598
Meth lab, everybody, all right,

641
00:49:32,665 --> 00:49:35,434
500 feet, everybody's evacuated.

642
00:49:35,500 --> 00:49:36,602
Everybody's out.

643
00:49:36,669 --> 00:49:38,403
And as you're pullin' them out, interview 'em.

644
00:49:38,470 --> 00:49:40,305
Let's find out who these guys are

645
00:49:40,372 --> 00:49:41,741
and what they're doing, all right?

646
00:49:41,808 --> 00:49:42,875
Sarge, thanks so much for comin'.

647
00:49:42,942 --> 00:49:44,309
- We could use the help. - Yeah, no problem.

648
00:49:44,376 --> 00:49:45,577
We got two guys on foot.

649
00:49:45,645 --> 00:49:46,679
We could sure use a guard.

650
00:49:46,746 --> 00:49:48,313
I'll get you one.

651
00:49:48,380 --> 00:49:49,414
Radio 30-03,

652
00:49:49,481 --> 00:49:51,751
- can I get a K9 out here? - All right, guys.

653
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:55,454
Chief, what the hell happened?

654
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:56,588
Meth lab explosion.

655
00:49:56,656 --> 00:49:57,857
That's all we know.

656
00:49:57,924 --> 00:49:59,726
Two guys on foot.

657
00:49:59,792 --> 00:50:02,527
These guys are gonna be evacuating the rest of the park.

658
00:50:02,594 --> 00:50:04,296
Sure could use some help gettin' that done.

659
00:50:58,818 --> 00:51:01,654
This book contains anything

660
00:51:01,721 --> 00:51:04,757
and everything you'll need to know

661
00:51:04,824 --> 00:51:06,324
about Red Dwarf.

662
00:51:58,778 --> 00:52:01,948
Detective, please, come on in.

663
00:52:02,014 --> 00:52:03,015
Mr. Mayor.

664
00:52:04,150 --> 00:52:07,019
This is Officer Finnick, Lake Orion Police.

665
00:52:07,086 --> 00:52:08,221
Pleasure to meet you.

666
00:52:08,286 --> 00:52:09,421
- Thank you, sir. - Assistin' us on this case.

667
00:52:09,488 --> 00:52:10,522
Thank you, thank you, thank you for seeing me.

668
00:52:10,589 --> 00:52:13,059
I know it's a tad bit unusual meetin' me

669
00:52:13,126 --> 00:52:14,994
without the chief present.

670
00:52:15,061 --> 00:52:16,696
Nothin' inappropriate, is it?

671
00:52:16,763 --> 00:52:19,098
Of course, it's only a personal matter.

672
00:52:19,165 --> 00:52:20,532
Well, I don't do favors.

673
00:52:20,599 --> 00:52:22,635
Relax, Nightingale.

674
00:52:22,702 --> 00:52:24,871
You're a good man.

675
00:52:24,937 --> 00:52:26,005
You're an honest cop.

676
00:52:26,072 --> 00:52:27,807
No need to prove anything to me.

677
00:52:28,908 --> 00:52:30,076
Besides, you don't even know what I wanted

678
00:52:30,143 --> 00:52:31,811
to meet with you about.

679
00:52:31,878 --> 00:52:35,715
This about your, um, godson Marcel, is it?

680
00:52:36,649 --> 00:52:39,484
What was it, vandalism at 14,

681
00:52:39,551 --> 00:52:41,520
B-and-E at 15,

682
00:52:41,586 --> 00:52:45,357
got caught with an unregistered weapon that same year,

683
00:52:46,959 --> 00:52:48,393
somethin' like that?

684
00:52:48,460 --> 00:52:49,862
All charges were dropped.

685
00:52:51,264 --> 00:52:54,499
You think you got all the answers, don't you, Nightingale?

686
00:52:54,566 --> 00:52:55,433
That's my job.

687
00:52:55,500 --> 00:52:56,501
That's what I do.

688
00:52:56,568 --> 00:52:58,938
And I try to know who I'm dealin' with.

689
00:52:59,005 --> 00:53:01,974
I'm a business man, from Jersey,

690
00:53:02,041 --> 00:53:05,044
American made from American goods.

691
00:53:06,179 --> 00:53:07,713
You see, I'm not some rich asshole

692
00:53:07,780 --> 00:53:10,582
with a sports team or some hometown gangster

693
00:53:10,650 --> 00:53:12,450
with a dozen hands in his pockets.

694
00:53:14,120 --> 00:53:18,590
Look, all this bullshit about the gangs, revenge wars,

695
00:53:18,658 --> 00:53:20,793
turf killings, whatever you want to call it,

696
00:53:20,860 --> 00:53:22,762
it has nothin' to do with my son.

697
00:53:24,030 --> 00:53:28,567
Look, your godson is involved in this case,

698
00:53:28,634 --> 00:53:29,534
and that's a fact.

699
00:53:30,870 --> 00:53:32,872
The boy is just runnin' scared,

700
00:53:33,840 --> 00:53:35,007
but he's no murderer.

701
00:53:47,753 --> 00:53:49,055
I have a possible murder suspect

702
00:53:49,121 --> 00:53:50,957
in the abandoned warehouse on Oak Street,

703
00:53:51,023 --> 00:53:51,958
asking for another unit.

704
00:53:54,627 --> 00:53:55,962
10-4, 501.

705
00:53:56,028 --> 00:53:58,463
There's another unit available in the area of Oak Street,

706
00:53:58,530 --> 00:53:59,966
got your back, 501.

707
00:54:02,567 --> 00:54:03,836
502, we're in the area.

708
00:54:03,903 --> 00:54:06,772
Two-man unit, we'll be there in a second.

709
00:57:01,847 --> 00:57:02,715
Freeze!

710
00:57:07,353 --> 00:57:08,087
This is Finnick.

711
00:57:08,154 --> 00:57:10,689
I need backup on the roof.

712
00:57:52,131 --> 00:57:53,732
- Calm down, everyone. - With all due respect,

713
00:57:53,799 --> 00:57:57,103
Madam Mayor, these people deserve answers.

714
00:57:57,169 --> 00:58:00,106
I promise you, your voices will be heard.

715
00:58:00,172 --> 00:58:04,043
We will hear from each and every one of you, I promise.

716
00:58:10,116 --> 00:58:11,851
No, she won't!

717
00:58:11,917 --> 00:58:15,154
The Nain Rouge will kill us all!

718
00:58:37,943 --> 00:58:41,714
There have been 17 mysterious deaths of local residents

719
00:58:41,780 --> 00:58:45,951
within the week, and our community is at a great loss.

720
00:58:46,018 --> 00:58:49,421
Our council has laid out a plan of action.

721
00:58:49,488 --> 00:58:50,789
If you would allow me,

722
00:58:50,856 --> 00:58:54,927
I'd like to introduce our chief of police, Chief Romano.

723
00:58:54,994 --> 00:58:57,730
And lastly, effective immediately,

724
00:58:57,796 --> 00:59:01,834
I have enacted a curfew, from 8 p.m. until 6 a.m.,

725
00:59:01,901 --> 00:59:02,868
that's effective

726
00:59:02,935 --> 00:59:05,204
for all residents.

727
00:59:05,271 --> 00:59:06,138
Okay.

728
00:59:08,407 --> 00:59:11,377
Madam Mayor, the people deserve a reprieve

729
00:59:11,443 --> 00:59:12,511
from all this chaos.

730
00:59:12,578 --> 00:59:14,747
This is bullshit!

731
00:59:14,813 --> 00:59:16,749
Folks, please.

732
00:59:16,815 --> 00:59:17,816
Hey, come on, folks!

733
00:59:18,484 --> 00:59:20,219
Folks, please.

734
00:59:20,286 --> 00:59:22,421
This isn't what you think.

735
00:59:22,488 --> 00:59:26,192
It's only in place to keep you safe

736
00:59:26,258 --> 00:59:28,227
and your families accounted for.

737
00:59:29,094 --> 00:59:32,398
At 8 p.m., the curfew happens.

738
00:59:32,464 --> 00:59:37,002
And we want you either in your home or well on your way.

739
00:59:46,245 --> 00:59:49,848
Everyone, now, everyone, please, please.

740
00:59:52,851 --> 00:59:54,720
We all need to do our part.

741
00:59:55,854 --> 00:59:58,123
If you're home, then our fine men

742
00:59:58,190 --> 01:00:00,292
and women uniform will know you are safe.

743
01:00:02,361 --> 01:00:03,095
Look at all of you.

744
01:00:03,162 --> 01:00:04,230
Who's that motherfucker?

745
01:00:04,296 --> 01:00:06,065
- Gathered under one roof. - The pastor.

746
01:00:06,131 --> 01:00:07,566
Hmm.

747
01:00:07,634 --> 01:00:11,103
Coming together at just the right time.

748
01:00:14,473 --> 01:00:15,507
We need each other.

749
01:00:18,043 --> 01:00:20,446
There are forces out there

750
01:00:20,512 --> 01:00:23,282
that will try and tear us apart.

751
01:00:26,885 --> 01:00:27,753
No.

752
01:00:29,288 --> 01:00:32,091
An unwavering belief in the Lord

753
01:00:33,225 --> 01:00:37,229
and in our police force is what we can count on

754
01:00:37,296 --> 01:00:40,132
to keep us strong,

755
01:00:41,200 --> 01:00:42,301
keep us united.

756
01:00:45,504 --> 01:00:50,109
As for the person or persons responsible,

757
01:00:52,378 --> 01:00:53,779
let's just pray

758
01:00:55,114 --> 01:01:00,185
that all lost souls find their way back to salvation.

759
01:01:02,588 --> 01:01:04,356
The Nain Rouge is real!

760
01:01:04,423 --> 01:01:06,392
I lost my niece to drug violence,

761
01:01:06,458 --> 01:01:07,761
and I want the police to do something about it!

762
01:01:07,826 --> 01:01:10,162
We all heard about this little red devil on the loose.

763
01:01:10,229 --> 01:01:13,198
Is there a monster loose in Lake Orion?

764
01:01:13,265 --> 01:01:16,135
People, people, please, please.

765
01:01:16,201 --> 01:01:18,871
We need to keep our heads about us.

766
01:01:18,937 --> 01:01:21,974
There isn't anything supernatural going on.

767
01:01:22,975 --> 01:01:24,476
We've all heard the stories.

768
01:01:25,944 --> 01:01:27,880
Campfire tales, that's all.

769
01:01:30,082 --> 01:01:32,084
I need you to trust us,

770
01:01:34,219 --> 01:01:38,624
all of us, that we are doing everything we can

771
01:01:38,692 --> 01:01:40,025
to get to the bottom.

772
01:01:41,628 --> 01:01:45,364
In fact, Officer Finnick, who do you have there with you?

773
01:01:46,298 --> 01:01:48,467
Oh, my apologies, Chief,

774
01:01:48,534 --> 01:01:51,036
and to the great people of Lake Orion.

775
01:01:51,103 --> 01:01:52,071
I'm Detective Nightingale

776
01:01:52,137 --> 01:01:54,039
from the Detroit Police Department.

777
01:01:54,106 --> 01:01:56,308
I'm here on a special assignment to assist

778
01:01:56,375 --> 01:01:58,110
in investigating these murders.

779
01:01:59,978 --> 01:02:01,380
If you'll have me!

780
01:02:03,650 --> 01:02:06,151
Well, that'll be just fine by me.

781
01:02:06,218 --> 01:02:09,188
And in fact, I think that just about does it.

782
01:02:09,254 --> 01:02:11,924
Please be safe, everyone, going home

783
01:02:11,990 --> 01:02:14,326
and respect the curfew tonight.

784
01:02:14,393 --> 01:02:16,128
God bless you all.

785
01:02:32,544 --> 01:02:33,479
- Hey. - Hi.

786
01:02:34,748 --> 01:02:36,548
What happened to you at the town hall meeting?

787
01:02:36,615 --> 01:02:38,951
You know I'm not a politics guy.

788
01:02:39,017 --> 01:02:40,953
I was looking for you, today.

789
01:02:41,019 --> 01:02:42,287
I took a trip outta town.

790
01:02:43,422 --> 01:02:45,424
If you're, uh, not on this thing all night,

791
01:02:45,491 --> 01:02:47,092
or you just want to take a break,

792
01:02:47,159 --> 01:02:48,360
you should stop by later.

793
01:02:50,229 --> 01:02:52,464
I, uh, think I could do that.

794
01:02:54,099 --> 01:02:55,100
Okay.

795
01:02:55,167 --> 01:02:56,001
See you then.

796
01:03:04,243 --> 01:03:06,044
Is that your man there?

797
01:03:07,680 --> 01:03:08,547
Not yet.

798
01:03:09,415 --> 01:03:10,582
The night's still young.

799
01:03:12,719 --> 01:03:14,486
Now what's good here?

800
01:03:14,553 --> 01:03:15,655
Cheeseburgers.

801
01:03:17,055 --> 01:03:17,923
You buying?

802
01:03:19,057 --> 01:03:19,925
Why not?

803
01:03:50,389 --> 01:03:52,324
It has been summoned.

804
01:04:10,677 --> 01:04:12,578
Hey, perfect timing, come here.

805
01:04:15,314 --> 01:04:16,315
Set your phone down.

806
01:04:17,717 --> 01:04:19,485
Put these on.

807
01:04:19,551 --> 01:04:21,353
Here, push your hair back first.

808
01:04:21,420 --> 01:04:22,722
I don't think you want me to touch this...

809
01:04:22,789 --> 01:04:23,823
I got it, I got it.

810
01:04:23,890 --> 01:04:24,757
Thing.

811
01:04:26,124 --> 01:04:27,192
What is this?

812
01:04:28,594 --> 01:04:29,561
I'm not really sure.

813
01:04:29,629 --> 01:04:31,530
I was hoping you could help me out.

814
01:04:32,799 --> 01:04:33,565
Okay.

815
01:04:33,633 --> 01:04:35,400
Kind of a work in progress.

816
01:04:42,574 --> 01:04:43,308
Is this your first time?

817
01:04:43,375 --> 01:04:45,177
- Yeah. - Okay.

818
01:04:45,244 --> 01:04:47,747
Grab on to here, don't press the red handle.

819
01:04:47,814 --> 01:04:49,047
Put your mask down.

820
01:04:50,315 --> 01:04:52,451
I'm gonna guide you, okay?

821
01:04:54,319 --> 01:04:55,187
Okay.

822
01:04:57,289 --> 01:04:58,223
And...

823
01:04:59,926 --> 01:05:01,560
Now go in straight.

824
01:05:35,895 --> 01:05:38,430
How'd I do?

825
01:05:38,497 --> 01:05:39,732
Not bad at all.

826
01:05:41,466 --> 01:05:42,334
I'm impressed.

827
01:06:17,502 --> 01:06:19,438
Good afternoon, Doc.

828
01:06:19,504 --> 01:06:21,841
I'm Detective Nightingale from Detroit Police.

829
01:06:21,908 --> 01:06:22,709
Dr. Muscovites.

830
01:06:22,775 --> 01:06:24,911
Pleasure to meet you, Detective.

831
01:06:24,978 --> 01:06:26,879
What's our story here?

832
01:06:26,946 --> 01:06:29,181
Got a real unusual case here.

833
01:06:29,247 --> 01:06:31,651
He's got a combination of real deep thermal

834
01:06:31,718 --> 01:06:35,855
and chemical burns, some real unusual wounds here.

835
01:06:35,922 --> 01:06:37,924
Either he learns how to shave less aggressively

836
01:06:37,991 --> 01:06:42,227
and not sit under the sunlamp all day, or as he claims,

837
01:06:42,294 --> 01:06:44,731
some red, little, rodent-looking monster broke

838
01:06:44,797 --> 01:06:47,566
into his house and blew up his meth lab

839
01:06:47,634 --> 01:06:49,601
and left him lookin' like this.

840
01:07:28,775 --> 01:07:31,176
Who did this to you, Ike?

841
01:07:39,317 --> 01:07:40,653
Get me out of here!

842
01:07:40,720 --> 01:07:42,387
Get me out of here!

843
01:07:43,823 --> 01:07:47,259
No, I need to get out of here!

844
01:07:47,325 --> 01:07:48,795
He's comin' for us all!

845
01:07:48,861 --> 01:07:51,563
Every single one of you motherfuckers is gonna die!

846
01:07:51,631 --> 01:07:52,899
He'll cut your tongue out

847
01:07:52,965 --> 01:07:55,500
before you even get a fuckin' word out!

848
01:07:55,567 --> 01:07:56,334
Let go of me, man!

849
01:07:56,401 --> 01:07:58,503
I need to get out of here!

850
01:07:58,570 --> 01:07:59,604
Let me go!

851
01:07:59,672 --> 01:08:01,540
- I got this. - Let me go!

852
01:08:01,606 --> 01:08:03,208
Ike, I got this!

853
01:08:04,342 --> 01:08:05,210
Ah!

854
01:08:06,478 --> 01:08:07,479
Ah!

855
01:08:13,019 --> 01:08:15,888
The ice cream social is next Sunday after services.

856
01:08:15,955 --> 01:08:17,289
Please stick around.

857
01:08:18,623 --> 01:08:23,428
I was reading a poem last week that I found in college,

858
01:08:24,664 --> 01:08:26,699
and it means more to me now than it did then,

859
01:08:26,766 --> 01:08:29,301
and I think it will for you, too.

860
01:08:29,367 --> 01:08:34,372
From "Ulysses," by Lord Alfred Tennyson.

861
01:08:36,943 --> 01:08:39,444
- Please. - I got this.

862
01:08:39,511 --> 01:08:40,880
Just tell me who did it.

863
01:08:42,115 --> 01:08:43,248
Who was it?

864
01:08:44,416 --> 01:08:45,283
The devil.

865
01:08:46,953 --> 01:08:48,020
It was the devil.

866
01:08:48,087 --> 01:08:49,889
Calm down, Ike.

867
01:08:49,956 --> 01:08:51,791
- Please. - Calm down.

868
01:08:52,825 --> 01:08:54,326
Leave the drugs alone, man.

869
01:08:54,392 --> 01:08:56,261
I told you that your whole life.

870
01:08:57,864 --> 01:08:59,564
Now get off of that shit, boy.

871
01:08:59,632 --> 01:09:01,934
I told you about that shit.

872
01:09:03,803 --> 01:09:07,006
- Please. - No, man, let go of me, man!

873
01:09:07,073 --> 01:09:08,975
Come on, man, it's gonna be all right.

874
01:09:11,409 --> 01:09:12,678
Ike, hold on, just hold on, man.

875
01:09:14,513 --> 01:09:15,948
This'll be fine.

876
01:09:16,015 --> 01:09:16,949
I got this.

877
01:09:18,017 --> 01:09:19,518
I'll be right back.

878
01:09:19,584 --> 01:09:20,619
Just hold tight.

879
01:09:44,476 --> 01:09:45,878
Much abides.

880
01:09:48,047 --> 01:09:50,850
Though we are not now that strength,

881
01:09:52,051 --> 01:09:56,421
which in old days, moved earth and heaven,

882
01:09:56,488 --> 01:10:00,325
that which we are, we are.

883
01:10:01,093 --> 01:10:04,163
One equal temper of heroic hearts

884
01:10:04,230 --> 01:10:09,434
made weak my time and fate,

885
01:10:13,739 --> 01:10:14,941
but strong in will,

886
01:10:17,542 --> 01:10:21,479
to strive, to seek,

887
01:10:22,782 --> 01:10:27,385
to find, and not to yield.

888
01:11:20,039 --> 01:11:21,807
Are you okay?

889
01:11:21,874 --> 01:11:23,408
Yeah, I'm fine.

890
01:11:25,311 --> 01:11:26,879
I gotta go.

891
01:11:26,946 --> 01:11:28,014
Okay.

892
01:11:28,080 --> 01:11:28,915
Duty calls.

893
01:11:30,883 --> 01:11:31,884
I'll see you soon?

894
01:11:32,985 --> 01:11:34,887
Yeah, yeah.

895
01:12:29,208 --> 01:12:30,608
You are good.

896
01:13:50,222 --> 01:13:50,890
Great.

897
01:13:54,693 --> 01:13:56,629
What more do I gotta say?

898
01:13:57,696 --> 01:13:59,632
You don't come around here, you hear me?

899
01:13:59,698 --> 01:14:02,034
This is my place as much as it is the boy's.

900
01:14:02,101 --> 01:14:04,370
But that don't mean just anyone's invited.

901
01:14:04,437 --> 01:14:05,805
Are you listenin' to me?

902
01:14:07,907 --> 01:14:09,642
In or out of uniform,

903
01:14:09,708 --> 01:14:13,679
you don't touch an officer of the law, ever!

904
01:14:13,746 --> 01:14:15,915
You also don't get to tell me who I can see.

905
01:14:17,249 --> 01:14:19,652
From now on, when we meet,

906
01:14:19,718 --> 01:14:22,088
you either smile, nod or wave.

907
01:14:22,154 --> 01:14:24,056
I don't care which.

908
01:14:24,123 --> 01:14:26,325
Then you go about your business.

909
01:14:26,392 --> 01:14:28,060
Don't say a single word.

910
01:14:28,127 --> 01:14:30,362
And if I ever catch you smelling like this again

911
01:14:30,429 --> 01:14:32,965
in a vehicle, I'll run your ass in.

912
01:14:35,935 --> 01:14:37,169
Now I loved your daughter.

913
01:14:38,437 --> 01:14:40,873
If I could've traded places with her, I would have.

914
01:14:40,940 --> 01:14:42,441
And I like your son.

915
01:14:42,508 --> 01:14:43,943
That's just the way it is.

916
01:14:45,144 --> 01:14:47,379
But none of that changes anything.

917
01:14:47,446 --> 01:14:49,014
It's best you get used to it.

918
01:15:33,893 --> 01:15:35,427
You deserve some credit.

919
01:15:37,930 --> 01:15:39,932
It was all your idea, after all.

920
01:15:42,301 --> 01:15:45,037
You've spoken of Nain Rouge for ,

921
01:15:47,439 --> 01:15:49,341
well, as long as I can remember.

922
01:15:52,444 --> 01:15:53,879
But we took action.

923
01:16:03,856 --> 01:16:05,724
How can I possibly explain?

924
01:16:08,561 --> 01:16:13,732
Trying times demand drastic measures.

925
01:16:14,833 --> 01:16:17,236
You're a naive son of a bitch.

926
01:16:18,337 --> 01:16:19,572
It's too dangerous.

927
01:16:21,340 --> 01:16:25,077
You don't have the slightest idea of what you're doing.

928
01:16:25,144 --> 01:16:30,149
The congregation, the people of Lake Orion want this.

929
01:16:33,852 --> 01:16:37,223
Lasting peace and prosperity.

930
01:16:37,289 --> 01:16:38,157
Bullshit!

931
01:16:39,525 --> 01:16:41,060
We'll all burn for this.

932
01:16:41,126 --> 01:16:42,428
No, you're wrong.

933
01:16:44,863 --> 01:16:47,366
I know the word of the Lord.

934
01:16:49,301 --> 01:16:50,169
I've heard it.

935
01:16:51,904 --> 01:16:52,871
He speaks to me.

936
01:16:55,007 --> 01:16:57,743
Now put the gun away

937
01:16:59,245 --> 01:17:03,449
and just accept that this is a blessing from God.

938
01:17:05,884 --> 01:17:08,287
You made a deal with the devil, Pastor.

939
01:17:11,557 --> 01:17:15,527
Anna Lee, you put that gun down, right now.

940
01:17:17,062 --> 01:17:18,464
Do as he says.

941
01:17:18,530 --> 01:17:21,300
The people won't stand for it.

942
01:17:22,234 --> 01:17:23,502
Now, Anna Lee.

943
01:17:23,569 --> 01:17:25,070
This is your last warning.

944
01:17:27,139 --> 01:17:28,307
She's not gonna shoot.

945
01:17:31,377 --> 01:17:35,214
Our secret is safe with her.

946
01:17:35,281 --> 01:17:36,882
Please, Anna Lee.

947
01:17:40,419 --> 01:17:44,023
Let's hope God forgives both of you.

948
01:18:11,651 --> 01:18:13,218
Billie, it's Romano.

949
01:18:15,421 --> 01:18:16,288
What?

950
01:18:17,156 --> 01:18:19,058
Yes, I'll be there, in a second.

951
01:18:28,967 --> 01:18:30,235
Dad!

952
01:18:30,302 --> 01:18:31,537
Dad!

953
01:18:31,603 --> 01:18:33,005
Oh my God.

954
01:18:33,072 --> 01:18:34,239
Here, sit down.

955
01:18:35,374 --> 01:18:36,442
Jesus Christ.

956
01:18:46,251 --> 01:18:48,554
Neither of you move, all right?

957
01:18:50,456 --> 01:18:51,090
Come on.

958
01:18:51,156 --> 01:18:52,524
There's a monster.

959
01:18:52,591 --> 01:18:53,626
He's on his way here.

960
01:18:54,761 --> 01:18:57,996
And, Ellis, you're gonna help me kill it.

961
01:18:59,164 --> 01:19:01,066
Help you kill what?

962
01:19:01,133 --> 01:19:05,170
It's like a, like a red, some sort of a just...

963
01:19:06,505 --> 01:19:08,073
Listen, I don't care what the fuck this is about!

964
01:19:08,140 --> 01:19:10,342
I need to get him to a hospital now!

965
01:19:10,409 --> 01:19:11,678
Dad?

966
01:19:11,745 --> 01:19:14,213
Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad, no, no, no, no, no, no.

967
01:19:14,279 --> 01:19:15,981
Dad, will you talk to me, please?

968
01:19:16,048 --> 01:19:17,182
- You hear me? - Okay.

969
01:19:17,249 --> 01:19:18,217
We can figure this thing out,

970
01:19:18,283 --> 01:19:20,219
and then you're gonna help me kill it

971
01:19:20,285 --> 01:19:21,420
when it gets here.

972
01:19:22,421 --> 01:19:24,089
And we'll get him to a hospital.

973
01:19:24,156 --> 01:19:25,725
We'll get him to a hospital.

974
01:19:25,792 --> 01:19:26,659
Do you hear me?

975
01:19:27,694 --> 01:19:28,695
Do you hear me?

976
01:19:28,762 --> 01:19:30,229
Yeah, I fuckin' hear you!

977
01:19:31,130 --> 01:19:32,498
It doesn't matter now.

978
01:19:39,304 --> 01:19:41,006
Ellis, where are you going?

979
01:19:41,073 --> 01:19:42,675
Don't you get any bright ideas.

980
01:19:42,742 --> 01:19:44,476
I used up all my bright ideas!

981
01:19:48,547 --> 01:19:50,082
You know what this is?

982
01:19:51,818 --> 01:19:52,819
A knife?

983
01:19:52,886 --> 01:19:55,354
That monster you were talking about,

984
01:19:55,421 --> 01:19:56,321
that was me!

985
01:19:57,222 --> 01:19:58,190
I summoned it

986
01:19:59,425 --> 01:20:00,526
to kill people like you.

987
01:20:00,592 --> 01:20:02,662
Do you know how many people you've killed?

988
01:20:02,729 --> 01:20:04,563
That's not gonna bring my mom back,

989
01:20:04,631 --> 01:20:07,132
my sister back, and now my dad!

990
01:20:07,199 --> 01:20:08,635
But it'll fuckin' kill you!

991
01:20:08,701 --> 01:20:09,568
Call it off, Ellis!

992
01:20:16,442 --> 01:20:17,710
Ellis!

993
01:20:17,777 --> 01:20:19,111
Freeze.

994
01:20:21,480 --> 01:20:23,081
Turn around.

995
01:20:23,148 --> 01:20:24,349
I'm gonna need the knife.

996
01:20:25,617 --> 01:20:27,687
Not gonna happen.

997
01:20:27,754 --> 01:20:29,689
It doesn't matter.

998
01:20:29,756 --> 01:20:31,457
This is your end.

999
01:20:31,523 --> 01:20:32,191
No.

1000
01:20:34,293 --> 01:20:35,762
Shoot me if you have to.

1001
01:21:26,646 --> 01:21:28,848
You're gonna die here for that, Ellis.

1002
01:21:28,915 --> 01:21:30,482
And no magic's gonna save you.

1003
01:21:30,549 --> 01:21:31,818
Had you been really so righteous,

1004
01:21:31,885 --> 01:21:34,353
it would've been you out there, stickin' his neck out,

1005
01:21:34,419 --> 01:21:37,155
instead of hangin' this on every member of this town.

1006
01:21:38,323 --> 01:21:39,759
Well, we're gonna change all that, aren't we?

1007
01:21:52,872 --> 01:21:54,741
Get up, girl.

1008
01:23:56,294 --> 01:23:58,530
Billie, this motherfucker's been here.

1009
01:25:05,998 --> 01:25:09,836
Billie Jean!

1010
01:25:47,106 --> 01:25:48,875
No.

1011
01:25:48,941 --> 01:25:50,342
No, help!

1012
01:25:50,408 --> 01:25:51,376
Finnick!

1013
01:25:51,443 --> 01:25:54,814
Finnick!

1014
01:25:56,749 --> 01:25:58,851
You motherfucker!

1015
01:25:58,918 --> 01:26:00,887
Get your motherfuckin' ass out of here.

1016
01:26:04,657 --> 01:26:07,627
What the fuck is wrong with you?

1017
01:26:22,041 --> 01:26:23,075
Drop her, man, now!

1018
01:26:29,115 --> 01:26:30,750
Red Dwarf!

1019
01:26:30,817 --> 01:26:32,018
Come here!

1020
01:26:32,084 --> 01:26:32,885
Get over here.

1021
01:26:39,125 --> 01:26:39,926
Billie, no!

1022
01:27:00,478 --> 01:27:01,881
No, you ruined it!

1023
01:27:03,149 --> 01:27:03,950
Give me that.

1024
01:27:04,016 --> 01:27:04,817
Back up!

1025
01:27:04,884 --> 01:27:05,617
Get up!

1026
01:27:05,685 --> 01:27:07,687
Get up.

1027
01:27:07,753 --> 01:27:09,621
It's no good, Ellis.

1028
01:27:15,027 --> 01:27:17,495
I was doin' good for this town.

1029
01:27:17,562 --> 01:27:20,032
Hey, asshole, drop it or die!

1030
01:27:21,167 --> 01:27:23,002
LOPD ain't gonna let you walk out

1031
01:27:23,069 --> 01:27:26,706
of this motherfucker with one of their own.

1032
01:27:26,772 --> 01:27:28,440
Give it up, Ellis!

1033
01:27:35,281 --> 01:27:38,184
On your knees, hands on your head now!

1034
01:27:44,924 --> 01:27:46,826
I was trying to help.

1035
01:28:20,993 --> 01:28:22,427
How you feel?

1036
01:28:23,229 --> 01:28:24,897
I don't know.

1037
01:28:24,964 --> 01:28:26,832
What about your boy?

1038
01:28:30,803 --> 01:28:33,139
We lost all the monster evidence,

1039
01:28:35,174 --> 01:28:37,442
burned up the museum's artifact.

1040
01:28:38,844 --> 01:28:39,712
Dammit.

1041
01:28:40,646 --> 01:28:42,648
I don't know.

1042
01:28:42,715 --> 01:28:44,850
Maybe we should just keep him a couple days,

1043
01:28:44,917 --> 01:28:46,584
just for being an asshole.

1044
01:28:46,652 --> 01:28:48,955
We should've blamed all this shit on his ass.

1045
01:28:50,122 --> 01:28:51,757
Guess it's better than nothing.

1046
01:28:57,830 --> 01:28:59,531
Thank you.

1047
01:28:59,597 --> 01:29:03,669
Thank you.

1048
01:29:03,736 --> 01:29:05,603
You gonna be all right in this town.

1049
01:29:07,139 --> 01:29:09,041
Everybody's not made for the long war.

1050
01:29:11,077 --> 01:29:13,012
You'll do just fine, Finnick.

1051
01:29:15,748 --> 01:29:17,316
Take care of yourself.

1052
01:29:17,383 --> 01:29:18,684
You too.

1053
01:29:25,725 --> 01:29:28,995
Fellas, could I get a ride outta here?

1054
01:30:25,751 --> 01:30:26,819
I'm looking for a fighter

1055
01:30:26,886 --> 01:30:29,155
that goes by the name of Marcellus De Vaux.

1056
01:30:29,221 --> 01:30:30,956
You mean J.D., the Jersey Devil.

1057
01:30:31,023 --> 01:30:32,590
He's right there, honey.

1058
01:33:43,983 --> 01:33:45,884
See, old friend,

1059
01:33:45,951 --> 01:33:48,287
I broke more soldiers than you did.
