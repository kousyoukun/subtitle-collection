1
00:01:35,137 --> 00:01:37,753
You'll be glad
to be rid of him, I expect.

2
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:40,513
We'd be more than happy
to keep him here in custody.

3
00:01:40,684 --> 00:01:42,595
Six months are enough.

4
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:45,393
It's time for him to answer
for his crimes in Europe.

5
00:01:46,148 --> 00:01:48,810
President Picquery.
Mr. Spielman, sir.

6
00:01:49,401 --> 00:01:51,483
Prisoner is secured and ready to travel.

7
00:01:57,618 --> 00:01:59,654
You've thrown
everything at him, I see.

8
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:02,820
It was necessary.
He's extremely powerful.

9
00:02:04,041 --> 00:02:07,829
We've had to change his guard
three times. He's very persuasive.

10
00:02:08,712 --> 00:02:10,668
So we removed his tongue.

11
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:20,383
Grindelwald!
Grindelwald! Grindelwald!

12
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:27,140
Grindelwald! Grindelwald!

13
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:39,235
The wizarding
community worldwide

14
00:02:39,326 --> 00:02:40,941
owes you a great debt, Madam President.

15
00:02:41,453 --> 00:02:43,114
Do not underestimate him.

16
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:49,959
Mr. Spielman,
we found his wand hidden away.

17
00:02:53,465 --> 00:02:54,671
Abernathy.

18
00:02:56,218 --> 00:02:58,254
And we found this.

19
00:03:10,774 --> 00:03:12,139
Hiyah!

20
00:03:49,771 --> 00:03:52,558
No more silver tongue. Hmm?

21
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:08,857
You have joined
a noble cause, my friend.

22
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:22,754
I know. I know. I know, Antonio.

23
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:30,424
So needy.

24
00:08:39,978 --> 00:08:41,809
They're ready for you, Newt.

25
00:08:44,065 --> 00:08:45,225
Leta.

26
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:48,983
What are you doing here?

27
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:52,187
Theseus thought it would be good
if I became part of the Ministry family.

28
00:08:53,408 --> 00:08:55,694
Did he actually say the words
"Ministry family"?

29
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:58,151
That sounds like my brother.

30
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:18,255
Theseus was disappointed
you couldn't come to dinner.

31
00:09:19,434 --> 00:09:21,174
Any of the nights we've asked you.

32
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:23,263
Well, I've been busy.

33
00:09:23,438 --> 00:09:26,726
He's your brother, Newt.
He likes spending time with you.

34
00:09:27,609 --> 00:09:29,145
And so do I.

35
00:09:34,365 --> 00:09:36,697
Oi, you! Hop in, Pick.

36
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:40,493
Why do strange creatures
love you so much?

37
00:09:40,747 --> 00:09:42,641
Well, there are no strange creatures.
Only blinkered people.

38
00:09:42,665 --> 00:09:44,155
Only blinkered people.

39
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:51,084
How long did you get in detention
for saying that to Prendergast?

40
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:53,672
I think it was a month that time.

41
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:57,051
And I set off a Dungbomb under his desk
so I could join you. Do you remember?

42
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:03,765
Um...

43
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:05,684
No, I actually don't remember that.

44
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:08,187
Hello.

45
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:11,482
Theseus. We were just talking
about Newt coming for dinner.

46
00:10:11,653 --> 00:10:13,063
Really? Well...

47
00:10:14,531 --> 00:10:15,896
Look, before we go in there, I...

48
00:10:16,157 --> 00:10:18,037
It's my fifth attempt, Theseus.
I know the form.

49
00:10:18,076 --> 00:10:20,692
This isn't gonna
be like the other times. This is...

50
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:23,782
Just try and keep an open mind.
Will you?

51
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:25,822
And maybe a little less...

52
00:10:26,084 --> 00:10:27,199
Like me.

53
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:29,826
Well, it can't hurt.

54
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:32,291
Come on, let's go.

55
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:40,215
Hearing commences.

56
00:10:41,516 --> 00:10:45,225
You want an end to the ban
on you traveling internationally.

57
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:47,135
Why?

58
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:48,936
Because I'd like
to travel internationally.

59
00:10:49,107 --> 00:10:54,443
Subject uncooperative and evasive
on reasons for last international trip.

60
00:10:54,612 --> 00:10:56,477
It was a field trip, sir.

61
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:59,614
I was just collecting material
for my book on magical beasts.

62
00:10:59,951 --> 00:11:01,191
You destroyed half of New York.

63
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:03,222
No, that's actually factually incorrect
on two counts.

64
00:11:03,246 --> 00:11:04,246
Newt.

65
00:11:06,457 --> 00:11:09,290
Mr. Scamander, it's clear
you're frustrated,

66
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:12,452
and, frankly, so are we.

67
00:11:14,549 --> 00:11:18,087
In the spirit of compromise,
we'd like to make a proposition.

68
00:11:18,553 --> 00:11:19,963
What kind of proposition?

69
00:11:20,138 --> 00:11:23,676
The committee will agree to lift
your travel ban under one condition.

70
00:11:24,017 --> 00:11:25,803
You join the Ministry.

71
00:11:26,811 --> 00:11:29,473
Specifically, your brother's department.

72
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:33,775
No.

73
00:11:35,236 --> 00:11:37,318
I think that...

74
00:11:37,739 --> 00:11:39,445
Theseus is the Auror.

75
00:11:39,866 --> 00:11:41,322
I think my talents lie elsewhere.

76
00:11:41,492 --> 00:11:42,732
Mr. Scamander,

77
00:11:42,911 --> 00:11:46,324
the wizarding and non-wizarding worlds
have been at peace for over a century.

78
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:49,955
Grindelwald wants to see
that peace destroyed.

79
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:52,833
And for certain members
of our community,

80
00:11:53,004 --> 00:11:55,586
his message is very seductive.

81
00:11:56,925 --> 00:12:00,167
Many pure-bloods believe
it is their birthright to rule.

82
00:12:01,095 --> 00:12:05,054
Not only our world
but the non-magic world as well.

83
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:12,187
They see Grindelwald as their hero,
and Grindelwald sees this boy

84
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:14,559
as a means to make this all come true.

85
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:19,693
I'm sorry. You're talking about Credence
as if he were still here.

86
00:12:20,907 --> 00:12:22,647
He survived, Newt.

87
00:12:24,661 --> 00:12:25,992
He's still alive.

88
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:28,319
He left New York months ago.

89
00:12:28,831 --> 00:12:31,573
He's somewhere in Europe.
Where exactly, we don't know, but...

90
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:33,742
You want me to
hunt Credence down?

91
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:36,748
To kill him?

92
00:12:36,923 --> 00:12:39,084
Same old Scamander.

93
00:12:41,636 --> 00:12:42,967
What is he doing here?

94
00:12:43,054 --> 00:12:46,046
I'm taking on the job
that you're too soft to do.

95
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:51,634
Is that it?

96
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:58,440
Travel documentation denied.

97
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:02,486
Newt!

98
00:13:03,366 --> 00:13:05,594
You think I like the idea of Grimmson
any more than you do?

99
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:07,263
Listen, I don't want to hear how
the ends justify the means, Theseus.

100
00:13:07,287 --> 00:13:09,348
I think you're gonna have to pull
your head out the sand!

101
00:13:09,372 --> 00:13:11,558
Okay, right, here we go.
What a selfish, irresponsible...

102
00:13:11,582 --> 00:13:17,202
The time is coming when everyone
is gonna have to pick a side.

103
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:18,620
Even you.

104
00:13:19,424 --> 00:13:21,130
I don't do sides.

105
00:13:25,388 --> 00:13:27,754
Newt. Newt.

106
00:13:33,187 --> 00:13:34,518
Come here.

107
00:13:41,571 --> 00:13:42,856
They're watching you.

108
00:13:54,792 --> 00:13:56,123
Well, gentlemen...

109
00:13:57,503 --> 00:13:59,789
I assume this means I have the job.

110
00:15:21,838 --> 00:15:24,671
This will be suitable
after a thorough cleanse.

111
00:15:26,884 --> 00:15:29,296
I want you to go to the circus now.

112
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:31,586
Give my note to Credence.

113
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:33,345
Begin his journey.

114
00:15:33,516 --> 00:15:36,599
When we've won,
they'll flee cities in the millions.

115
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:38,517
They've had their time.

116
00:15:38,688 --> 00:15:40,929
We don't say such things out loud.

117
00:15:41,274 --> 00:15:42,810
We want only freedom.

118
00:15:43,484 --> 00:15:45,224
Freedom to be ourselves.

119
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:47,606
To annihilate non-wizards.

120
00:15:47,989 --> 00:15:49,945
Not all of them. Not all.

121
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:52,489
We're not merciless.

122
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:56,031
The beast of burden
will always be necessary.

123
00:17:04,565 --> 00:17:05,805
Ventus.

124
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:50,141
Dumbledore.

125
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:54,729
Were the less conspicuous
rooftops full, then?

126
00:17:54,824 --> 00:17:55,859
Hmm.

127
00:17:56,367 --> 00:17:58,699
I do enjoy a view.

128
00:18:00,288 --> 00:18:01,288
Nebulus.

129
00:18:06,961 --> 00:18:07,996
How was it?

130
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:10,536
They're still convinced
that you sent me to New York.

131
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:12,379
You told them I didn't?

132
00:18:12,883 --> 00:18:13,883
Yes.

133
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:15,260
Evening.

134
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:16,675
Even though you did.

135
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:21,493
You told me where to find that
trafficked Thunderbird, Dumbledore.

136
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:22,828
You knew that I would take him home,

137
00:18:22,852 --> 00:18:24,621
and you knew I'd have to
take him through a Muggle port.

138
00:18:24,645 --> 00:18:27,512
I've always felt an
affinity with the great magical birds.

139
00:18:27,607 --> 00:18:29,393
There's a story in my family

140
00:18:29,567 --> 00:18:33,276
that a phoenix will come
to any Dumbledore in desperate need.

141
00:18:33,446 --> 00:18:36,062
They say my great-grandfather had one.

142
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:40,279
And that it took flight when he died,
never to return.

143
00:18:40,703 --> 00:18:42,973
With all due respect, Professor,
I don't believe for a minute

144
00:18:42,997 --> 00:18:44,988
that's why you told me
about the Thunderbird.

145
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,340
So why did you send me to New York?

146
00:19:04,435 --> 00:19:07,768
Because I knew Grindelwald
would try to catch Credence.

147
00:19:07,855 --> 00:19:10,187
He had a vision, you see,
many years ago.

148
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:14,980
In which an Obscurial killed
the man he fears above all others.

149
00:19:16,238 --> 00:19:17,728
You.

150
00:19:21,577 --> 00:19:24,694
I thought you might deprive Grindelwald
of his weapon,

151
00:19:24,789 --> 00:19:27,747
not by killing Credence,
but by saving him.

152
00:19:32,963 --> 00:19:34,919
Credence is in Paris, Newt.

153
00:19:35,633 --> 00:19:37,464
Trying to trace his real family.

154
00:19:38,678 --> 00:19:42,796
I take it you've heard the rumors
about who he really is.

155
00:19:42,973 --> 00:19:43,973
No.

156
00:19:51,315 --> 00:19:55,649
The pure-bloods think he's the last
of an important French line.

157
00:19:57,947 --> 00:19:59,938
A baby whom everyone thought lost.

158
00:20:00,741 --> 00:20:01,741
Not Leta's brother?

159
00:20:01,826 --> 00:20:03,066
That's what they're whispering.

160
00:20:03,828 --> 00:20:06,695
And pure-blood or not, I know this.

161
00:20:07,498 --> 00:20:09,910
An Obscurus grows in the absence of love

162
00:20:10,418 --> 00:20:12,659
as a dark twin, an only friend.

163
00:20:12,837 --> 00:20:16,671
If Credence has a real brother or sister
out there that can take its place,

164
00:20:17,341 --> 00:20:19,002
he might yet be saved.

165
00:20:20,094 --> 00:20:22,506
Wherever Credence is in Paris,
he's either in danger,

166
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,466
or a danger to others.

167
00:20:25,141 --> 00:20:28,008
We may not know who he is yet,
but he needs to be found.

168
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:32,557
And I rather hope
you might be the one to find him.

169
00:20:37,862 --> 00:20:39,102
What's that?

170
00:20:39,697 --> 00:20:43,406
An address of a very old
acquaintance of mine.

171
00:20:44,368 --> 00:20:47,860
A safe house in Paris
reinforced with enchantments.

172
00:20:48,038 --> 00:20:50,120
Safe house?
Why would I need a safe house in Paris?

173
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:53,783
One hopes you won't, but should things
at some point go terribly wrong,

174
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:55,371
it's good to have a place to go.

175
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:58,128
You know, for a cup of tea.

176
00:20:58,299 --> 00:20:59,664
No. No, no, no.

177
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:01,199
Absolutely not.

178
00:21:01,469 --> 00:21:03,829
No, 'cause I'm banned from
international travel, Dumbledore.

179
00:21:03,888 --> 00:21:05,449
If I leave the country,
they will put me in Azkaban,

180
00:21:05,473 --> 00:21:06,804
and they will throw away the key.

181
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:09,260
- Do you know why I admire you, Newt?
- What?

182
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:12,510
More, perhaps, than any man I know.

183
00:21:14,565 --> 00:21:16,681
You do not seek power.

184
00:21:17,526 --> 00:21:18,732
Or popularity.

185
00:21:19,445 --> 00:21:24,109
You simply ask,
is a thing right in itself?

186
00:21:25,826 --> 00:21:27,908
If it is, you do it no matter the cost.

187
00:21:28,871 --> 00:21:30,849
That's all very well, Dumbledore,
but forgive me for asking.

188
00:21:30,873 --> 00:21:32,579
Why can't you go?

189
00:21:38,464 --> 00:21:40,455
I cannot move against Grindelwald.

190
00:21:44,011 --> 00:21:45,421
It has to be you.

191
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:53,600
Well, I can't blame you.

192
00:21:53,771 --> 00:21:56,353
In your shoes, I'd probably refuse too.

193
00:21:56,524 --> 00:21:58,890
- What?
- It's late. Good evening, Newt.

194
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:00,190
Wait, no.

195
00:22:01,278 --> 00:22:02,609
Oh, come on.

196
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:18,371
Dumbledore.

197
00:23:23,694 --> 00:23:24,694
Bunty!

198
00:23:27,364 --> 00:23:28,364
Bunty!

199
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:34,902
Bunty, the baby Nifflers
are loose again.

200
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,006
Well done.

201
00:23:48,218 --> 00:23:49,696
I'm so sorry, Newt.
They must've picked the lock

202
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:51,920
- while I was cleaning out the Augureys.
- Not to worry.

203
00:23:52,181 --> 00:23:53,181
Hmm.

204
00:23:58,729 --> 00:24:00,219
I fed nearly everyone.

205
00:24:00,397 --> 00:24:01,717
Pinky's had his nose drops and...

206
00:24:01,899 --> 00:24:02,899
And Elsie?

207
00:24:02,983 --> 00:24:04,586
Elsie's droppings
are nearly normal again.

208
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:05,610
Wonderful.

209
00:24:06,695 --> 00:24:09,402
You can, um... You can clock off now.

210
00:24:12,326 --> 00:24:15,180
- I told you to leave the kelpie to me.
- That wound needs more ointment.

211
00:24:15,204 --> 00:24:16,804
I don't want you losing fingers over it.

212
00:24:26,757 --> 00:24:29,464
Seriously, you go home now, Bunty.

213
00:24:30,844 --> 00:24:32,050
You must be exhausted.

214
00:24:32,221 --> 00:24:33,927
You know the kelpie's easier with two.

215
00:24:39,228 --> 00:24:41,014
Perhaps you should take off your shirt.

216
00:24:43,232 --> 00:24:44,722
Don't worry.

217
00:24:45,192 --> 00:24:46,728
I'll dry off quick enough.

218
00:25:28,318 --> 00:25:30,400
Someone needed to let off some steam.

219
00:25:30,654 --> 00:25:31,985
Ointment, Bunty.

220
00:25:38,662 --> 00:25:41,324
You bite Bunty again,
and there'll be trouble, mister.

221
00:25:44,501 --> 00:25:45,616
What was that?

222
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:47,410
I don't know.

223
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:51,584
But I want you to go home now, Bunty.

224
00:25:51,759 --> 00:25:53,124
- Shall I call the Ministry?
- No.

225
00:25:53,302 --> 00:25:55,042
I want you to go home. Please.

226
00:26:03,937 --> 00:26:05,817
- Just give me the pieces.
- I got it.

227
00:26:05,981 --> 00:26:07,667
Honey, if you could
just give it to me...

228
00:26:07,691 --> 00:26:09,147
He doesn't care.

229
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:11,225
If you could just give this
to me, sweetheart.

230
00:26:16,533 --> 00:26:18,524
Hey!

231
00:26:19,286 --> 00:26:22,403
Newt! Get over here, you maniac.

232
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:24,788
We hope you don't mind, Newt.

233
00:26:24,958 --> 00:26:25,958
We let ourselves in.

234
00:26:26,043 --> 00:26:28,580
It's rainin' out there, cats and dogs.

235
00:26:28,962 --> 00:26:30,168
London's cold.

236
00:26:30,339 --> 00:26:31,979
You were supposed
to have been obliviated.

237
00:26:32,007 --> 00:26:33,543
I know.

238
00:26:33,717 --> 00:26:35,173
It didn't work, pal.

239
00:26:35,552 --> 00:26:36,552
I mean, you said it.

240
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,676
The potion only erases bad memories.

241
00:26:38,847 --> 00:26:39,847
I didn't have any.

242
00:26:40,015 --> 00:26:42,176
I mean, uh, don't get me wrong.
I had some weird ones,

243
00:26:42,351 --> 00:26:43,932
and I had some scary ones.

244
00:26:44,186 --> 00:26:45,266
But this angel...

245
00:26:45,938 --> 00:26:50,147
This angel over here,
she filled me in on all the bad parts,

246
00:26:50,234 --> 00:26:52,316
and, uh, here we are, I guess, huh?

247
00:26:52,486 --> 00:26:54,943
This is wonderful.

248
00:26:57,282 --> 00:26:58,863
Wait. Is...

249
00:27:00,369 --> 00:27:03,111
Tina? Tina?

250
00:27:05,374 --> 00:27:07,365
Oh, it's just us, honey.

251
00:27:08,585 --> 00:27:10,075
Me and Jacob.

252
00:27:10,379 --> 00:27:11,664
Oh.

253
00:27:11,755 --> 00:27:13,483
Why don't I
make us some dinner, huh?

254
00:27:13,507 --> 00:27:14,667
Yes!

255
00:27:19,555 --> 00:27:20,761
Hey, honey.

256
00:27:20,848 --> 00:27:22,338
Teen and I aren't talking.

257
00:27:23,433 --> 00:27:26,470
- Why?
- Oh, well, you know...

258
00:27:26,645 --> 00:27:28,206
She found out about
Jacob and I seeing each other,

259
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:31,017
and she didn't like it,
'cause of the law.

260
00:27:31,108 --> 00:27:32,723
Not allowed to... Oop!

261
00:27:33,068 --> 00:27:34,729
Not allowed to date No-Majs,

262
00:27:35,195 --> 00:27:37,561
not allowed to marry them.
Blah, blah, blah.

263
00:27:38,699 --> 00:27:42,237
Well, she was all in a tizzy anyway
'cause of you.

264
00:27:42,828 --> 00:27:45,114
- Me?
- Yeah, you, Newt.

265
00:27:45,289 --> 00:27:46,995
It was in Spellbound.

266
00:27:47,416 --> 00:27:49,577
Here. I brought it for you.

267
00:27:53,797 --> 00:27:56,630
"Newt Scamander with fiancée
Leta Lestrange,

268
00:27:57,509 --> 00:28:00,000
"brother Theseus and unknown woman."

269
00:28:00,387 --> 00:28:02,753
No. So Theseus is marrying Leta, not me.

270
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:04,721
Oh!

271
00:28:05,934 --> 00:28:08,220
Oh... Oh, dear.

272
00:28:09,605 --> 00:28:10,685
Well...

273
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:14,014
See, Teen read that,

274
00:28:14,484 --> 00:28:16,145
and she started dating someone else.

275
00:28:17,487 --> 00:28:19,523
He's an Auror.
His name's Achilles Tolliver.

276
00:28:19,698 --> 00:28:21,029
Tolliver.

277
00:28:27,456 --> 00:28:28,456
Anyway...

278
00:28:28,999 --> 00:28:31,957
We are real excited to be here, Newt.
This is a...

279
00:28:32,211 --> 00:28:33,701
Well, it's a special trip for us.

280
00:28:34,671 --> 00:28:37,128
You see, Jacob and I,

281
00:28:38,217 --> 00:28:39,627
we're getting married.

282
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:44,378
I'm marrying Jacob.

283
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:48,181
Ah!

284
00:28:49,853 --> 00:28:51,389
Oh.

285
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:54,221
You've enchanted him,
haven't you?

286
00:28:55,317 --> 00:28:57,524
What?

287
00:28:57,611 --> 00:29:01,103
- I have not.
- Will you stop reading my mind?

288
00:29:01,281 --> 00:29:03,488
Queenie, you've brought him here
against his will.

289
00:29:03,659 --> 00:29:06,947
Oh, that is an outrageous accusation.
Look at him.

290
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:10,112
He's just happy. He's so happy.

291
00:29:10,666 --> 00:29:11,906
Then you won't mind if I, um...

292
00:29:14,169 --> 00:29:15,375
Please don't.

293
00:29:15,545 --> 00:29:17,315
Queenie, you've got nothing
to fear if he wants to get married.

294
00:29:17,339 --> 00:29:20,251
We can just lift the enchantment,
and he can tell us himself.

295
00:29:31,019 --> 00:29:32,219
What do you got there?

296
00:29:32,729 --> 00:29:33,844
What are you gonna do?

297
00:29:33,939 --> 00:29:35,779
What are you gonna do with that,
Mr. Scamander?

298
00:29:36,358 --> 00:29:37,358
Surgito.

299
00:29:48,704 --> 00:29:50,410
Congratulations
on your engagement, Jacob.

300
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:51,786
Wait, what?

301
00:29:55,961 --> 00:29:57,826
Oh, no. You didn't.

302
00:30:00,674 --> 00:30:01,880
Queenie!

303
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:03,130
One second.

304
00:30:04,094 --> 00:30:05,550
Queenie!

305
00:30:05,637 --> 00:30:07,844
It's very nice to see you.

306
00:30:08,015 --> 00:30:09,200
Where the hell am I right now?

307
00:30:09,224 --> 00:30:10,224
Uh, London.

308
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:11,350
Oh!

309
00:30:11,893 --> 00:30:13,474
I always wanted to go here!

310
00:30:14,146 --> 00:30:15,146
Queenie!

311
00:30:19,151 --> 00:30:20,641
Oh, Queenie, honey.

312
00:30:21,278 --> 00:30:23,198
Well, I'm curious
when you were gonna wake me up.

313
00:30:23,238 --> 00:30:24,569
After we had five kids?

314
00:30:27,868 --> 00:30:29,859
Why is it wrong to wanna marry you?

315
00:30:30,037 --> 00:30:32,244
- Okay.
- To wanna have a family?

316
00:30:33,415 --> 00:30:35,872
I just want what everyone else has,
that's all.

317
00:30:38,628 --> 00:30:39,868
Wait, wait.

318
00:30:40,047 --> 00:30:41,958
We've talked about this
like a million times.

319
00:30:42,132 --> 00:30:43,588
If we get married and they find out,

320
00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:45,278
they're gonna
throw you in jail, sweetheart.

321
00:30:45,302 --> 00:30:47,463
I can't have that.

322
00:30:47,804 --> 00:30:50,420
They don't like people like me
marrying people like you.

323
00:30:50,599 --> 00:30:53,887
I ain't a wizard. I'm just me.

324
00:30:54,061 --> 00:30:57,679
They're really progressive here,
and they'll let us get married properly.

325
00:30:57,856 --> 00:31:00,268
Sweetheart, you don't need
to enchant me.

326
00:31:01,151 --> 00:31:02,732
I'm already enchanted.

327
00:31:03,862 --> 00:31:05,693
I love you so much.

328
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:07,400
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

329
00:31:08,575 --> 00:31:11,362
But I can't have you
risking everything like this, you know?

330
00:31:11,536 --> 00:31:13,618
You're not giving us
a choice, sweetheart.

331
00:31:15,999 --> 00:31:17,705
You're not giving me a choice.

332
00:31:18,418 --> 00:31:21,125
One of us had to be brave,
and you were being a coward.

333
00:31:23,673 --> 00:31:25,334
I was being a coward?

334
00:31:26,051 --> 00:31:27,712
If I'm a coward, you're...

335
00:31:29,930 --> 00:31:30,930
Crazy.

336
00:31:32,557 --> 00:31:33,672
I didn't say it.

337
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:36,557
- You didn't have to.
- No, I didn't mean it, sweetheart.

338
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:38,931
Yeah, you did.

339
00:31:40,232 --> 00:31:43,099
- No.
- I'm gonna go see my sister.

340
00:31:43,944 --> 00:31:45,184
Fine. See your sister.

341
00:31:45,362 --> 00:31:47,273
- Fine.
- No, wait! Wait!

342
00:31:47,447 --> 00:31:49,278
No! Queenie!

343
00:31:51,326 --> 00:31:52,907
I didn't mean it.

344
00:31:55,205 --> 00:31:57,036
I didn't say nothin'.

345
00:32:10,512 --> 00:32:12,002
Papyrus Reparo.

346
00:32:34,494 --> 00:32:35,825
Hey, Newt!

347
00:32:36,204 --> 00:32:39,116
Down here, Jacob.
So I'll be with you in a second.

348
00:32:43,462 --> 00:32:44,793
I got my own problems.

349
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:11,770
Queenie left a postcard.

350
00:33:11,948 --> 00:33:13,688
Tina's in Paris looking for Credence.

351
00:33:13,867 --> 00:33:14,947
Genius.

352
00:33:15,368 --> 00:33:17,108
Queenie's gonna go straight for Tina.

353
00:33:17,287 --> 00:33:18,823
Okay, we're going to France, pal.

354
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:20,988
- Oh, hold on. I'll get my jacket.
- I've got it.

355
00:33:23,293 --> 00:33:24,408
Oh.

356
00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:30,841
Beautiful.

357
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:38,255
Come on.

358
00:33:38,642 --> 00:33:41,370
I don't think it's reasonable to ask
Bunty to cope with everyone in here

359
00:33:41,394 --> 00:33:42,725
and a bunch of newborns, so...

360
00:33:42,938 --> 00:33:44,974
Are you insane?

361
00:33:45,065 --> 00:33:47,056
You've got a pack of Nifflers now?

362
00:33:48,235 --> 00:33:49,837
- In you hop.
- Remember what happened last time?

363
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:51,692
I fixed the lock.

364
00:33:52,155 --> 00:33:53,895
So nothing gets out without my say-so.

365
00:33:56,117 --> 00:33:57,482
Come on.

366
00:33:59,663 --> 00:34:00,903
Get a move on.

367
00:34:06,711 --> 00:34:08,872
All right then, Accio necklace.

368
00:34:16,846 --> 00:34:19,588
Now you set a good example.

369
00:35:39,596 --> 00:35:40,836
Nagini.

370
00:35:46,603 --> 00:35:47,843
Credence.

371
00:35:51,066 --> 00:35:53,273
I think I know where she is.

372
00:35:59,449 --> 00:36:00,689
We escape tonight.

373
00:36:00,867 --> 00:36:01,867
Hey.

374
00:36:07,666 --> 00:36:10,123
I've told you
to stay away from her, boy.

375
00:36:10,835 --> 00:36:12,575
Did I say you could take a break?

376
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:14,873
Clean out the Kappa.

377
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:18,665
And you, get ready.

378
00:36:31,356 --> 00:36:35,474
Next, in our little show
of freaks and oddities,

379
00:36:35,944 --> 00:36:40,313
I present to you a Maledictus.

380
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:46,617
Once trapped
in the jungles of Indonesia,

381
00:36:47,539 --> 00:36:50,406
she is the carrier of a blood curse.

382
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:51,740
Ohh!

383
00:36:51,835 --> 00:36:56,420
Such Underbeings are destined
through the course of their lives

384
00:36:56,965 --> 00:36:59,331
to turn permanently into beasts.

385
00:36:59,426 --> 00:37:01,257
Ohh!

386
00:37:02,929 --> 00:37:03,969
But look at her.

387
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:07,005
So beautiful. Yes.

388
00:37:08,852 --> 00:37:10,808
So desirable.

389
00:37:11,563 --> 00:37:15,681
But soon, she will be trapped forever
in a very different body.

390
00:37:17,485 --> 00:37:21,194
Every night when she sleeps,
mesdames et messieurs,

391
00:37:22,741 --> 00:37:25,153
she is forced to become...

392
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:35,291
She is forced to become...

393
00:37:40,341 --> 00:37:43,048
She is forced to become...

394
00:37:52,312 --> 00:37:55,930
Over time, she will not be able
to transform back.

395
00:37:58,485 --> 00:38:02,353
She will be forever trapped
in the body of a snake.

396
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:36,980
Credence!

397
00:38:46,699 --> 00:38:47,905
Pack it up.

398
00:38:47,992 --> 00:38:49,732
Paris is done for us now.

399
00:39:19,691 --> 00:39:22,057
The boy with the Maledictus,
what do you know about him?

400
00:39:25,989 --> 00:39:27,650
He's looking for his mother.

401
00:39:27,824 --> 00:39:30,110
All my freaks think they can go home.

402
00:39:33,413 --> 00:39:34,653
Okay, let's go.

403
00:39:51,598 --> 00:39:53,463
Look, I think you and I
were at the circus

404
00:39:53,558 --> 00:39:55,048
for the same reason, Monsieur...

405
00:39:55,727 --> 00:39:57,558
Kama. Yusuf Kama.

406
00:39:58,855 --> 00:40:00,095
And you think right.

407
00:40:00,189 --> 00:40:02,229
- What do you want with Credence?
- The same as you.

408
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,400
Which is?

409
00:40:03,484 --> 00:40:05,270
To prove who the boy really is.

410
00:40:09,198 --> 00:40:11,234
If the rumors of his identity
are correct,

411
00:40:11,326 --> 00:40:14,910
he and I are, distantly, related.

412
00:40:16,581 --> 00:40:18,663
I am the last male
of my pure-blooded line,

413
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:20,957
and so,
if the rumors are correct, is he.

414
00:40:23,087 --> 00:40:26,875
Have you read
The Predictions of Tycho Dodonus?

415
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:30,883
Yeah. But that's poetry, not proof.

416
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:32,050
Hmm.

417
00:40:34,307 --> 00:40:36,218
If I could show you something better,

418
00:40:37,852 --> 00:40:41,094
more concrete,
something that proves who he is,

419
00:40:41,981 --> 00:40:44,814
would the Ministries of Europe
and America let him live?

420
00:40:46,569 --> 00:40:47,979
They might.

421
00:40:49,906 --> 00:40:51,112
Then come.

422
00:41:01,292 --> 00:41:02,623
Oh, no, Yaxley.

423
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:05,452
I hate the way he makes a beeline for me
every time.

424
00:41:05,546 --> 00:41:08,504
Well, if you insist on being
the most beautiful woman in the room.

425
00:41:08,591 --> 00:41:10,047
It's not that and you know it.

426
00:41:10,927 --> 00:41:12,918
It's all blood with Yaxley.

427
00:41:13,012 --> 00:41:17,005
Let me go and congratulate him
and we can dance

428
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:19,820
and I promise I won't say a word
to anyone for the rest of the night.

429
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:22,636
- Promise?
- Promise.

430
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:27,265
Sorry.

431
00:41:32,073 --> 00:41:34,234
- How have you been?
- You sly dog.

432
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:43,750
Is it her?

433
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:45,075
It is, look.

434
00:41:49,298 --> 00:41:50,788
Her brother's alive.

435
00:41:52,677 --> 00:41:54,213
The prediction is true.

436
00:41:56,097 --> 00:41:58,588
Her brother will lead us
from the shadows.

437
00:42:18,077 --> 00:42:21,661
Return, great avenger,
with wings from the water.

438
00:42:22,957 --> 00:42:24,697
Congratulations, Leta.

439
00:42:24,792 --> 00:42:26,703
Your brother lives.

440
00:42:27,170 --> 00:42:28,626
We all truly believe it.

441
00:43:28,189 --> 00:43:29,189
So...

442
00:43:32,944 --> 00:43:34,775
Credence Barebone.

443
00:43:36,948 --> 00:43:40,156
Nearly destroyed
by the woman who raised him.

444
00:43:40,993 --> 00:43:43,655
Yet now he seeks
the mother who bore him.

445
00:43:44,664 --> 00:43:46,495
He's desperate for family.

446
00:43:47,458 --> 00:43:49,198
He's desperate for love.

447
00:43:50,670 --> 00:43:53,377
He's the key to our victory.

448
00:43:54,257 --> 00:43:55,963
We know where the boy is, don't we?

449
00:43:57,510 --> 00:44:00,843
- Why don't we grab him and leave?
- He must come to me freely,

450
00:44:01,514 --> 00:44:02,674
and he will.

451
00:44:04,308 --> 00:44:07,892
The path has been laid,
and he is following it.

452
00:44:10,273 --> 00:44:12,480
The trail that will lead him to me

453
00:44:13,276 --> 00:44:16,985
and the strange and glorious truth
of who he is.

454
00:44:17,155 --> 00:44:18,861
Why is he so important?

455
00:44:26,122 --> 00:44:30,491
Who represents the greatest threat
to our cause?

456
00:44:31,502 --> 00:44:33,083
Albus Dumbledore.

457
00:44:33,588 --> 00:44:35,328
If I asked you now

458
00:44:35,506 --> 00:44:39,465
to go to the school where he is hiding
and kill him for me,

459
00:44:39,635 --> 00:44:41,375
would you do it for me, Krall?

460
00:44:47,727 --> 00:44:50,139
Credence is the only entity alive

461
00:44:51,856 --> 00:44:53,471
who can kill him.

462
00:44:55,318 --> 00:44:57,024
You really think
he can kill the Great...

463
00:44:59,822 --> 00:45:01,813
Can kill Albus Dumbledore?

464
00:45:02,617 --> 00:45:04,699
I know he can.

465
00:45:05,328 --> 00:45:09,287
But will you be with us
when that happens, Krall?

466
00:45:12,460 --> 00:45:13,666
Will you?

467
00:46:05,263 --> 00:46:06,823
What if she doesn't want me?

468
00:46:15,940 --> 00:46:17,521
Make it happen.

469
00:46:19,402 --> 00:46:20,437
What?

470
00:46:21,988 --> 00:46:24,479
Because we're free.

471
00:47:46,405 --> 00:47:48,316
Jacob, that man
Tina's been seeing...

472
00:47:48,491 --> 00:47:50,197
Don't worry.
She's gonna see you,

473
00:47:50,284 --> 00:47:51,844
and she'll see the four of us together,

474
00:47:51,994 --> 00:47:53,930
it'll be just like New York
all over again. Don't worry about it.

475
00:47:53,954 --> 00:47:55,307
Yes, but he's an Auror,
Queenie said.

476
00:47:55,331 --> 00:47:57,691
Yeah, he's an Auror. So what?
Don't worry about him.

477
00:48:00,878 --> 00:48:03,711
What do you think
I should say to her if I see her?

478
00:48:05,257 --> 00:48:08,920
Oh, well, it's best
not to plan these things.

479
00:48:09,553 --> 00:48:12,761
You know, you just say
whatever comes to you in the moment.

480
00:48:17,103 --> 00:48:19,810
She has eyes just like a salamander.

481
00:48:20,856 --> 00:48:22,016
Don't say that.

482
00:48:25,820 --> 00:48:28,687
Look,
you just tell her that you missed her.

483
00:48:28,864 --> 00:48:30,274
- Right.
- Right, and then,

484
00:48:30,449 --> 00:48:33,282
you came all the way to Paris
just to find her.

485
00:48:33,911 --> 00:48:36,118
She'll love that. And then,

486
00:48:36,997 --> 00:48:40,239
tell her you're losing sleep at night
for thinking of her and...

487
00:48:41,794 --> 00:48:43,897
Just don't say nothing about
no salamanders, all right?

488
00:48:43,921 --> 00:48:44,921
- Okay.
- Okay.

489
00:48:45,506 --> 00:48:46,837
Hey. Hey, hey.

490
00:48:48,592 --> 00:48:49,832
It's gonna be all right.

491
00:48:50,219 --> 00:48:51,504
We're in this together, pal.

492
00:48:52,012 --> 00:48:54,332
Okay, I'm gonna help you out.
I'm gonna help you find Tina,

493
00:48:54,432 --> 00:48:55,672
find Queenie,

494
00:48:56,559 --> 00:48:58,519
and we'll all be happy again,
just like old times.

495
00:48:58,686 --> 00:48:59,721
Who is this guy?

496
00:49:01,772 --> 00:49:04,980
Oh, he's the only way I can
leave the country without documentation.

497
00:49:05,151 --> 00:49:07,608
Now, you don't suffer from
motion sickness, do you?

498
00:49:08,112 --> 00:49:09,818
I don't do well on boats, Newt.

499
00:49:10,614 --> 00:49:11,694
You'll be fine.

500
00:49:11,782 --> 00:49:13,902
Stir your stumps.
Leaves in one minute.

501
00:49:15,453 --> 00:49:16,453
50 Galleons.

502
00:49:16,537 --> 00:49:17,697
No, we said 30.

503
00:49:17,788 --> 00:49:19,779
Uh-huh. 30 to go to France.

504
00:49:20,124 --> 00:49:21,830
20 not to tell anyone

505
00:49:21,917 --> 00:49:25,034
I seen Newt Scamander
leaving the country illegally.

506
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:28,120
Price of fame, pal.

507
00:49:32,553 --> 00:49:34,464
Mmm. Ten seconds.

508
00:49:34,638 --> 00:49:36,674
- Eight.
- Jacob.

509
00:49:36,765 --> 00:49:37,925
Seven.

510
00:49:39,185 --> 00:49:40,265
Six.

511
00:49:41,187 --> 00:49:42,187
Mmm...

512
00:49:43,314 --> 00:49:44,429
Four.

513
00:49:45,274 --> 00:49:47,265
Three. Two.

514
00:49:48,277 --> 00:49:49,517
One.

515
00:49:58,996 --> 00:50:00,736
I didn't like
that Portkey, Newt.

516
00:50:00,915 --> 00:50:02,325
So you keep saying.

517
00:50:02,875 --> 00:50:04,115
Follow me.

518
00:50:10,883 --> 00:50:11,883
Confundus.

519
00:50:17,014 --> 00:50:18,894
Come on.
It'll wear off in a few minutes.

520
00:50:30,444 --> 00:50:32,685
Appare Vestigium.

521
00:50:38,077 --> 00:50:39,112
Accio Niffler.

522
00:50:40,329 --> 00:50:41,569
Get looking.

523
00:50:41,914 --> 00:50:43,450
Oi! Get looking!

524
00:50:46,961 --> 00:50:48,076
That's a Kappa.

525
00:50:49,088 --> 00:50:50,624
It's a Japanese water demon.

526
00:50:55,553 --> 00:50:56,713
Tina?

527
00:50:57,471 --> 00:50:58,471
Tina!

528
00:51:05,187 --> 00:51:06,723
What have you found?

529
00:51:11,110 --> 00:51:12,670
And we're licking the dirt now.

530
00:51:26,542 --> 00:51:27,873
Revelio.

531
00:51:30,421 --> 00:51:32,537
Newt, what made those?

532
00:51:33,132 --> 00:51:34,497
That is a Zouwu.

533
00:51:37,136 --> 00:51:38,842
It's a Chinese creature.

534
00:51:39,013 --> 00:51:41,174
They are incredibly fast
and incredibly powerful.

535
00:51:41,682 --> 00:51:43,673
They can travel 1,000 miles in a day,

536
00:51:44,226 --> 00:51:46,538
and this one could take you
from one part of Paris to the next

537
00:51:46,562 --> 00:51:47,597
in a single leap.

538
00:51:51,483 --> 00:51:52,723
Oh, good boy.

539
00:51:54,445 --> 00:51:55,901
Jacob, she was here.

540
00:51:56,614 --> 00:51:57,899
Tina stood here.

541
00:51:58,282 --> 00:52:00,318
She has incredibly narrow feet.
Have you noticed?

542
00:52:02,494 --> 00:52:04,075
Can't say that I have.

543
00:52:08,042 --> 00:52:09,578
Then someone came towards her.

544
00:52:21,597 --> 00:52:22,928
Avensegium.

545
00:52:27,603 --> 00:52:29,218
- Right. Follow that feather.
- What?

546
00:52:29,396 --> 00:52:31,356
- Jacob, follow the feather.
- Follow the feather.

547
00:52:31,774 --> 00:52:33,105
Where is he?

548
00:52:34,109 --> 00:52:35,144
Accio Niffler.

549
00:52:42,618 --> 00:52:44,028
Drop the bucket.

550
00:53:24,159 --> 00:53:27,276
I'm sorry,
I don't know what you just said at all.

551
00:53:27,621 --> 00:53:29,862
Welcome to the French Ministry of Magic.

552
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:31,655
What is your business, please?

553
00:53:32,835 --> 00:53:36,828
I need to
speak to Tina Goldstein.

554
00:53:36,922 --> 00:53:41,916
She's an American Auror
working on a case here.

555
00:53:46,807 --> 00:53:48,047
We have no Tina Goldstein here.

556
00:53:49,268 --> 00:53:51,975
No, I'm sorry.
There must be some sort of mistake.

557
00:53:52,062 --> 00:53:55,020
See, I know she's in Paris.
She sent me a postcard.

558
00:53:55,190 --> 00:53:56,790
I brought it.
I can show it to you. Here.

559
00:53:56,859 --> 00:53:59,521
Maybe you can help me find it here.
It's just in here. Oh!

560
00:54:00,654 --> 00:54:03,396
Rabbits! If you can
just wait one moment!

561
00:54:03,574 --> 00:54:05,940
I know it's in here somewhere.
I definitely packed it.

562
00:54:06,118 --> 00:54:07,358
Where is it?

563
00:54:07,536 --> 00:54:08,867
One second.

564
00:54:09,037 --> 00:54:10,698
What did I do with you?

565
00:54:45,657 --> 00:54:47,427
Could we at least
stop for coffee or...

566
00:54:47,451 --> 00:54:48,451
Not now, Jacob.

567
00:54:48,535 --> 00:54:51,026
Chocolat chaud or...
Just for a second?

568
00:54:55,542 --> 00:54:57,145
- I don't know.
- This way. Come on.

569
00:54:57,169 --> 00:55:00,502
Pain au chocolat?
Half a croissant and a bonbon?

570
00:55:00,672 --> 00:55:01,832
This way.

571
00:55:06,929 --> 00:55:08,009
Jacob!

572
00:55:22,110 --> 00:55:23,110
Jacob?

573
00:57:48,131 --> 00:57:49,416
She's home.

574
00:58:36,888 --> 00:58:38,288
Are you Irma?

575
00:58:39,850 --> 00:58:41,841
Are you Irma Dugard?

576
00:58:43,395 --> 00:58:47,764
I'm sorry.
Your name is on my adoption paper.

577
00:58:49,651 --> 00:58:51,061
Does this make sense?

578
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:55,521
You gave me
to Mrs. Barebone in New York.

579
00:59:15,010 --> 00:59:17,001
I am not your mother.

580
00:59:17,179 --> 00:59:18,635
I was only a servant.

581
00:59:22,809 --> 00:59:25,050
You were so beautiful a baby.

582
00:59:27,606 --> 00:59:29,688
And you are a beautiful man.

583
00:59:40,368 --> 00:59:42,700
I did not want to leave you there.

584
00:59:43,330 --> 00:59:45,161
Why didn't they want me?

585
00:59:49,836 --> 00:59:52,703
Why is your name on my adoption paper?

586
00:59:52,881 --> 00:59:55,873
I took you to Mrs. Barebone

587
00:59:57,636 --> 00:59:59,922
because she was supposed
to look after you.

588
01:02:07,349 --> 01:02:08,759
She's dead.

589
01:02:11,394 --> 01:02:13,385
How did the boy take it?

590
01:02:14,940 --> 01:02:16,350
He's sensitive.

591
01:02:18,318 --> 01:02:21,060
The Ministry won't be happy
when I tell them I missed.

592
01:02:22,364 --> 01:02:24,025
I know my reputation.

593
01:02:24,199 --> 01:02:28,033
Listen to me. The disapproval of cowards
is praise to the brave.

594
01:02:29,162 --> 01:02:34,282
Your name will be written in glory
when wizards rule the world.

595
01:02:35,293 --> 01:02:37,625
And the clock is ticking faster.

596
01:02:38,546 --> 01:02:42,038
You watch over Credence. Keep him safe.

597
01:02:43,218 --> 01:02:44,879
For the greater good.

598
01:02:46,388 --> 01:02:48,049
For the greater good.

599
01:02:51,142 --> 01:02:52,822
You know what
I miss about Queenie?

600
01:02:55,438 --> 01:02:56,769
Everything.

601
01:02:59,276 --> 01:03:01,437
I even miss the stuff
that drove me nuts.

602
01:03:01,945 --> 01:03:03,435
Like the mind reading.

603
01:03:09,995 --> 01:03:14,534
I was lucky to have someone like her
even interested in anything I thought.

604
01:03:16,793 --> 01:03:18,374
You know what I mean?

605
01:03:19,462 --> 01:03:20,462
Sorry?

606
01:03:25,677 --> 01:03:28,965
I was saying, you're sure
the guy is here that we're looking for?

607
01:03:29,139 --> 01:03:31,630
Yeah, definitely. The feather says so.

608
01:04:02,047 --> 01:04:03,357
Is that the guy
we're looking for?

609
01:04:03,381 --> 01:04:04,381
Yes.

610
01:04:06,801 --> 01:04:07,801
Ooh...

611
01:04:09,971 --> 01:04:10,971
Sorry.

612
01:04:11,806 --> 01:04:13,762
Bonjour. Bonjour, monsieur.

613
01:04:15,310 --> 01:04:17,310
Oh, wait, no.
Sorry. So we actually...

614
01:04:17,395 --> 01:04:20,262
We were just wondering
if you'd come across a friend of ours.

615
01:04:21,024 --> 01:04:22,139
Tina Goldstein.

616
01:04:22,609 --> 01:04:24,691
Monsieur, Paris is a large city.

617
01:04:24,778 --> 01:04:25,813
She's an Auror.

618
01:04:27,072 --> 01:04:31,281
And when Aurors go missing,
the Ministry tend to come looking, so...

619
01:04:32,994 --> 01:04:35,952
No, I suppose it would probably
be better if we just report her absence.

620
01:04:36,456 --> 01:04:37,821
Is she tall?

621
01:04:39,459 --> 01:04:40,699
Dark? Rather...

622
01:04:40,877 --> 01:04:42,117
- Intense.
- Beautiful. She's...

623
01:04:42,962 --> 01:04:44,623
Yeah, what I meant to say was...

624
01:04:44,798 --> 01:04:47,255
- No, she's very pretty.
- She's intense too.

625
01:04:48,009 --> 01:04:51,297
I think I saw
someone like this last night.

626
01:04:53,515 --> 01:04:55,301
Perhaps if I showed you where...

627
01:04:55,475 --> 01:04:56,995
If you wouldn't mind. That would be...

628
01:04:57,894 --> 01:04:59,509
- That would be lovely.
- Sure.

629
01:05:38,059 --> 01:05:39,174
Tina.

630
01:05:40,687 --> 01:05:41,802
Newt.

631
01:05:41,896 --> 01:05:43,056
- Expelliarmus.
- Oh!

632
01:05:45,483 --> 01:05:48,441
My apologies, Mr. Scamander.

633
01:05:49,070 --> 01:05:52,483
I shall return and release you
once Credence is dead.

634
01:05:52,657 --> 01:05:53,657
Kama, wait.

635
01:05:53,825 --> 01:05:57,534
You see, either he dies or I do.

636
01:05:58,580 --> 01:05:59,990
No, no, no.

637
01:06:00,165 --> 01:06:02,531
Oh, no. No, no, no.

638
01:06:12,886 --> 01:06:15,252
Well, that's not the best start
to a rescue attempt.

639
01:06:15,430 --> 01:06:17,045
Oh, this was a rescue attempt?

640
01:06:17,223 --> 01:06:19,509
You just lost me my only lead.

641
01:06:19,851 --> 01:06:22,763
Well, how was the interrogation going
before we turned up?

642
01:06:26,107 --> 01:06:27,107
Newt!

643
01:06:31,905 --> 01:06:33,020
Well done, Pick.

644
01:06:35,492 --> 01:06:37,232
So you need this man, you said?

645
01:06:37,911 --> 01:06:39,117
Yeah.

646
01:06:39,287 --> 01:06:41,869
I think he knows
where Credence is, Mr. Scamander.

647
01:06:46,878 --> 01:06:48,414
Well, that'll be that Zouwu.

648
01:07:08,650 --> 01:07:09,981
Come on, Newt. Get outta there.

649
01:08:02,620 --> 01:08:03,620
Come on!

650
01:08:35,570 --> 01:08:39,529
What were the three biggest mistakes
that you made last time?

651
01:08:40,908 --> 01:08:42,708
- Caught by surprise, sir.
- Mmm.

652
01:08:42,785 --> 01:08:43,820
What else?

653
01:08:43,995 --> 01:08:45,555
Didn't parry before counter-curse, sir.

654
01:08:45,663 --> 01:08:48,154
Very good. The last one?

655
01:08:48,708 --> 01:08:51,324
The most important one?

656
01:08:58,551 --> 01:09:00,587
Not learning from the first two.

657
01:09:03,556 --> 01:09:06,172
This is a school. You've no right.

658
01:09:06,351 --> 01:09:08,216
I'm the Head of Magical Law Enforcement.

659
01:09:08,311 --> 01:09:10,518
I have the right
to go wherever I please.

660
01:09:12,649 --> 01:09:14,059
Out of here.

661
01:09:18,488 --> 01:09:20,399
Go with Professor McGonagall, please.

662
01:09:27,455 --> 01:09:29,241
He's the best teacher we've got.

663
01:09:29,415 --> 01:09:31,015
- Thanks, McClaggan.
- Get out.

664
01:09:31,417 --> 01:09:32,748
Come, McClaggan.

665
01:09:38,091 --> 01:09:39,922
Newt Scamander is in Paris.

666
01:09:41,386 --> 01:09:42,386
Really?

667
01:09:42,470 --> 01:09:44,586
Cut the pretense.
I know he's there on your orders.

668
01:09:44,681 --> 01:09:46,717
Oh, if you'd ever had the pleasure
to teach him,

669
01:09:46,808 --> 01:09:49,595
you'd know Newt is not
a great follower of orders.

670
01:09:53,189 --> 01:09:55,145
You've read
The Predictions of Tycho Dodonus?

671
01:09:55,233 --> 01:09:56,723
Mmm. Many years ago.

672
01:09:57,443 --> 01:09:59,229
"A son cruelly banished

673
01:09:59,404 --> 01:10:01,144
"Despair of the daughter

674
01:10:01,322 --> 01:10:02,858
- "Return..."
- Yes, I know it.

675
01:10:05,702 --> 01:10:08,284
There's a rumor this prediction
refers to the Obscurial.

676
01:10:09,330 --> 01:10:11,286
They say that Grindelwald wants...

677
01:10:11,457 --> 01:10:13,322
As a highborn henchman.
I've heard the rumor.

678
01:10:13,418 --> 01:10:16,205
And yet, Scamander appears
wherever the Obscurial goes,

679
01:10:17,547 --> 01:10:18,957
to protect him.

680
01:10:19,716 --> 01:10:20,956
Meanwhile, you've built up

681
01:10:21,050 --> 01:10:24,292
quite the little network
of international contacts.

682
01:10:24,470 --> 01:10:27,712
However long you keep me
and my friends under surveillance,

683
01:10:27,890 --> 01:10:31,223
you're not going to discover
plots against you, Travers,

684
01:10:31,310 --> 01:10:32,971
because we want the same thing.

685
01:10:33,062 --> 01:10:34,973
The defeat of Grindelwald.

686
01:10:38,109 --> 01:10:42,022
But I warn you, your policies
of suppression and violence

687
01:10:42,822 --> 01:10:44,904
are pushing supporters into his arms.

688
01:10:45,074 --> 01:10:46,689
I'm not interested in your warnings.

689
01:10:49,203 --> 01:10:50,693
Now...

690
01:10:51,831 --> 01:10:55,574
It pains me to say it
because I don't like you...

691
01:10:57,920 --> 01:10:58,920
But...

692
01:11:00,840 --> 01:11:04,173
You are the only wizard
who is his equal.

693
01:11:08,431 --> 01:11:10,012
I need you to fight him.

694
01:11:15,772 --> 01:11:16,978
I can't.

695
01:11:21,194 --> 01:11:22,604
Because of this?

696
01:11:31,204 --> 01:11:33,741
You and Grindelwald
were as close as brothers.

697
01:11:35,541 --> 01:11:37,372
Oh, we were closer than brothers.

698
01:11:48,262 --> 01:11:50,674
Will you fight him?

699
01:11:52,767 --> 01:11:53,973
I can't.

700
01:11:55,520 --> 01:11:57,636
Well, then you have chosen your side.

701
01:12:00,733 --> 01:12:03,440
From now on,
I shall know every spell you cast.

702
01:12:03,820 --> 01:12:05,606
I'm doubling the watch on you,

703
01:12:05,780 --> 01:12:08,192
and you will no longer teach
Defense Against the Dark Arts.

704
01:12:10,576 --> 01:12:12,112
Where's Leta? We need to go to Paris.

705
01:12:18,543 --> 01:12:19,543
Theseus.

706
01:12:20,378 --> 01:12:22,585
Theseus, if Grindelwald calls a rally,

707
01:12:24,257 --> 01:12:25,372
don't try and break it up.

708
01:12:26,050 --> 01:12:27,836
Don't let Travers send you in there.

709
01:12:29,720 --> 01:12:30,960
If you ever trusted me...

710
01:12:31,138 --> 01:12:32,218
Theseus.

711
01:12:33,349 --> 01:12:34,349
Theseus!

712
01:13:15,725 --> 01:13:17,744
Even the name Lestrange
makes me feel sick.

713
01:13:17,768 --> 01:13:19,383
You know she stays here every vacation.

714
01:13:19,562 --> 01:13:21,302
Her family don't actually want her home.

715
01:13:21,480 --> 01:13:22,916
I don't blame them.
She's so annoying.

716
01:13:22,940 --> 01:13:24,100
Did you see her last week?

717
01:13:24,275 --> 01:13:25,355
Oscausi!

718
01:13:30,531 --> 01:13:31,987
Professor McGonagall!

719
01:13:32,158 --> 01:13:33,278
Lestrange has done it again!

720
01:13:33,451 --> 01:13:35,533
Lestrange, stop running!

721
01:13:35,703 --> 01:13:38,536
- Lestrange! Disobedient children.
- Leta, come back!

722
01:13:38,706 --> 01:13:40,867
Stop! Shame on the House of Slytherin.

723
01:13:40,958 --> 01:13:43,290
A hundred points! Two hundred!

724
01:13:43,461 --> 01:13:45,122
Get back here, right now!

725
01:13:46,672 --> 01:13:49,960
Children, stop it! You, stop! Come back!

726
01:13:50,134 --> 01:13:52,295
- Out of my way!
- Where has she gone?

727
01:13:52,470 --> 01:13:54,256
I think she went that way!

728
01:13:57,600 --> 01:13:59,591
Miss, it was Lestrange. She's horrible.

729
01:14:09,278 --> 01:14:11,269
Scamander,
why aren't you packing?

730
01:14:11,447 --> 01:14:13,062
I'm not going home.

731
01:14:14,075 --> 01:14:15,075
Why not?

732
01:14:15,868 --> 01:14:17,699
He needs me.

733
01:14:23,250 --> 01:14:24,865
He was hurt.

734
01:14:31,926 --> 01:14:33,257
What is that?

735
01:14:33,928 --> 01:14:35,293
A raven chick.

736
01:14:37,014 --> 01:14:39,380
Isn't the raven your family emblem?

737
01:14:39,558 --> 01:14:42,049
Yes, it is.

738
01:14:53,781 --> 01:14:54,987
All right, Newt.

739
01:14:55,574 --> 01:14:56,939
Be brave.

740
01:15:01,414 --> 01:15:02,904
That's an unusual one.

741
01:15:03,207 --> 01:15:07,450
So Mr. Scamander fears what
more than anything else in the world?

742
01:15:08,045 --> 01:15:10,206
Having to work in an office, sir.

743
01:15:10,297 --> 01:15:12,834
Go ahead, Newt.

744
01:15:16,137 --> 01:15:17,137
Riddikulus.

745
01:15:17,763 --> 01:15:18,763
Well done.

746
01:15:19,140 --> 01:15:21,222
Good job. Leta.

747
01:15:24,145 --> 01:15:25,385
It's only a Boggart.

748
01:15:25,563 --> 01:15:27,519
It can't hurt you.

749
01:15:29,567 --> 01:15:31,979
Everyone is scared of something.

750
01:15:33,696 --> 01:15:35,357
I've been looking forward to this.

751
01:16:20,034 --> 01:16:22,025
I don't want to talk about it.

752
01:16:37,676 --> 01:16:39,007
They know me,

753
01:16:40,304 --> 01:16:42,465
or they'd hide.

754
01:16:44,683 --> 01:16:47,174
They only nest in trees
with wand-quality wood.

755
01:16:49,063 --> 01:16:50,724
Did you know that?

756
01:16:52,525 --> 01:16:55,016
And they have very complex social lives.

757
01:16:56,737 --> 01:16:59,695
If you watch them for long enough,
you realize...

758
01:17:17,633 --> 01:17:20,545
Hello, Leta. This is a surprise.

759
01:17:24,140 --> 01:17:26,756
Finding me in a classroom?

760
01:17:27,935 --> 01:17:29,391
Was I such a bad student?

761
01:17:29,562 --> 01:17:31,206
On the contrary,
you were one of my cleverest.

762
01:17:31,230 --> 01:17:33,141
I said "bad," not "stupid."

763
01:17:38,863 --> 01:17:40,353
Don't bother answering.

764
01:17:42,032 --> 01:17:43,072
I know you never liked me.

765
01:17:43,200 --> 01:17:44,531
You're wrong.

766
01:17:45,411 --> 01:17:46,446
I never thought you bad.

767
01:17:46,620 --> 01:17:49,077
You were alone, then.
Everybody else did.

768
01:17:49,874 --> 01:17:51,284
And they were right.

769
01:17:52,585 --> 01:17:53,995
I was wicked.

770
01:17:54,920 --> 01:17:56,626
Leta, I know how painful

771
01:17:56,714 --> 01:17:59,080
the rumors about your brother Corvus
must be for you.

772
01:17:59,175 --> 01:18:00,335
No, you don't.

773
01:18:02,052 --> 01:18:04,509
Not unless
you had a brother who died, too.

774
01:18:04,680 --> 01:18:06,762
In my case, it was my sister.

775
01:18:09,727 --> 01:18:11,342
Did you love her?

776
01:18:19,987 --> 01:18:21,727
Not as well as I should have done.

777
01:18:25,659 --> 01:18:27,490
Never too late to free yourself.

778
01:18:29,872 --> 01:18:34,366
Confession is a relief, I'm told.
A great weight lifted.

779
01:18:38,464 --> 01:18:40,455
Regret is my constant companion.

780
01:18:41,508 --> 01:18:43,669
Do not let it become yours.

781
01:18:54,021 --> 01:18:56,103
Oh! No, thank you.

782
01:18:56,398 --> 01:18:57,729
Well...

783
01:18:57,816 --> 01:18:59,647
You've been really kind,

784
01:18:59,818 --> 01:19:03,982
but my sister Tina's probably
worried sick about me.

785
01:19:04,156 --> 01:19:07,148
You know,
banging on all the doors and things,

786
01:19:08,702 --> 01:19:09,942
so I think I'd better be going.

787
01:19:10,037 --> 01:19:12,119
But you haven't met your host.

788
01:19:12,831 --> 01:19:14,037
Oh, are you married?

789
01:19:15,084 --> 01:19:16,369
Let's say,

790
01:19:17,586 --> 01:19:19,542
deeply committed.

791
01:19:21,966 --> 01:19:24,799
You see, I can't tell if you're
making a joke or if you're just...

792
01:19:25,511 --> 01:19:27,752
French.

793
01:19:33,644 --> 01:19:34,644
Oh.

794
01:19:37,731 --> 01:19:40,268
Hey, knock it off.

795
01:19:47,491 --> 01:19:48,981
You stay right there.

796
01:19:49,576 --> 01:19:51,157
I know what you are.

797
01:19:52,121 --> 01:19:53,236
Queenie.

798
01:19:55,082 --> 01:19:56,538
We are not here to hurt you.

799
01:19:57,626 --> 01:19:59,036
We only want to help you.

800
01:20:00,879 --> 01:20:03,712
You're so very, very far away from home.

801
01:20:04,341 --> 01:20:08,300
Far away from everything you love,
everything that is comfortable.

802
01:20:10,848 --> 01:20:13,260
I would never see you harmed.

803
01:20:14,101 --> 01:20:15,261
Ever.

804
01:20:16,979 --> 01:20:20,813
It is not your fault
that your sister is an Auror.

805
01:20:22,860 --> 01:20:24,942
I wish you were working with me now

806
01:20:25,904 --> 01:20:30,238
towards a world where
we wizards were free to live openly.

807
01:20:32,411 --> 01:20:34,026
To love freely.

808
01:20:46,175 --> 01:20:48,006
You are an innocent.

809
01:20:50,387 --> 01:20:51,718
So go now.

810
01:20:53,682 --> 01:20:55,218
Leave this place.

811
01:21:05,152 --> 01:21:06,152
There you are.

812
01:21:06,278 --> 01:21:10,066
What did Travers want?
Absolutely outrageous behavior.

813
01:21:10,199 --> 01:21:11,564
Marching into a school like that.

814
01:21:11,658 --> 01:21:13,148
It was all very mundane,

815
01:21:13,327 --> 01:21:15,613
I'm fine, sorry, Minerva,
lot of marking.

816
01:22:42,583 --> 01:22:46,747
Hey, uh, Newt, buddy. Uh...

817
01:22:47,004 --> 01:22:49,040
Tina's up here.
She's all by her lonesome,

818
01:22:49,214 --> 01:22:51,671
and, uh, maybe you want to come up
and keep her company?

819
01:22:52,718 --> 01:22:55,425
Uh, I've been looking for food,
and I ain't found any,

820
01:22:57,014 --> 01:22:59,005
so I guess I'm gonna go upstairs
and try my luck

821
01:22:59,183 --> 01:23:01,549
in, oh, I don't know, the attic.

822
01:23:03,020 --> 01:23:04,351
You're all right.

823
01:23:04,521 --> 01:23:05,761
Relashio.

824
01:23:11,862 --> 01:23:12,862
Okay.

825
01:23:25,709 --> 01:23:27,449
She's responded well to the Dittany.

826
01:23:28,921 --> 01:23:30,411
She was born to run, you see.

827
01:23:31,089 --> 01:23:33,626
But I think she's...
She's just lacking in confidence.

828
01:23:34,927 --> 01:23:36,821
Mr. Scamander,
have you got anything in your case

829
01:23:36,845 --> 01:23:39,006
that might help revive this man?

830
01:23:39,097 --> 01:23:40,257
I need to question him.

831
01:23:40,349 --> 01:23:42,949
I think he knows who Credence really is.
And the scars on his hand

832
01:23:42,976 --> 01:23:44,976
- suggest an Unbreakable Vow.
- An Unbreakable Vow.

833
01:23:45,062 --> 01:23:46,552
Yeah, I noticed that, too.

834
01:23:58,408 --> 01:23:59,408
Lumos.

835
01:24:06,667 --> 01:24:07,998
What was that?

836
01:24:08,168 --> 01:24:09,999
There must be
a Water Dragon in that sewer.

837
01:24:11,463 --> 01:24:13,954
They carry these parasites,
you see. They, um...

838
01:24:14,758 --> 01:24:16,623
- Jacob.
- Yeah?

839
01:24:18,095 --> 01:24:21,303
In my case, in the pocket there,
you'll find a pair of tweezers.

840
01:24:21,723 --> 01:24:22,723
Tweezers?

841
01:24:23,475 --> 01:24:25,370
- They're thin, pointy...
- Little pointy things.

842
01:24:25,394 --> 01:24:26,914
Yes, I know what tweezers are.

843
01:24:29,648 --> 01:24:31,368
All right.
You might not want to watch this.

844
01:24:32,150 --> 01:24:33,390
I can handle it.

845
01:24:38,365 --> 01:24:39,365
Come out.

846
01:24:39,533 --> 01:24:42,149
Come on. You're all right.

847
01:24:42,661 --> 01:24:45,243
- Ew.
- Come on. I got you.

848
01:24:46,248 --> 01:24:47,559
Jacob, will you take that for me?

849
01:24:47,583 --> 01:24:49,619
Huh. Ugh!

850
01:24:51,878 --> 01:24:52,878
Calamari.

851
01:24:55,591 --> 01:24:57,502
Must kill him.

852
01:24:57,676 --> 01:24:59,007
Who?

853
01:24:59,094 --> 01:25:00,209
Credence?

854
01:25:01,597 --> 01:25:03,366
It may take him
a few hours to recover.

855
01:25:03,390 --> 01:25:05,381
That parasite's poison is quite strong.

856
01:25:07,144 --> 01:25:09,260
I have to go back to the Ministry
with what I've got.

857
01:25:11,523 --> 01:25:13,084
It's nice to see you again,
Mr. Scamander.

858
01:25:13,108 --> 01:25:15,190
Hey. Hey.
Hold on a second, will ya?

859
01:25:15,277 --> 01:25:17,017
Hold on. Hold on.

860
01:25:17,112 --> 01:25:19,194
Wait! Tina.

861
01:25:23,660 --> 01:25:25,321
You didn't mention salamanders, did you?

862
01:25:25,495 --> 01:25:28,077
No, I didn't.
She just ran. I don't know...

863
01:25:28,999 --> 01:25:30,785
So you chase after her.

864
01:25:31,918 --> 01:25:34,534
Tina. Please, just listen to me.

865
01:25:35,172 --> 01:25:38,209
Mr. Scamander, I need to go talk
to the Ministry.

866
01:25:38,508 --> 01:25:40,248
I know how you feel about Aurors.

867
01:25:40,510 --> 01:25:41,795
I may have been a little strong

868
01:25:41,887 --> 01:25:43,448
in the way that I expressed myself
in that letter.

869
01:25:43,472 --> 01:25:46,635
What was the exact phrase?
"A bunch of careerist hypocrites"?

870
01:25:46,850 --> 01:25:48,202
I'm sorry, but I can't admire people

871
01:25:48,226 --> 01:25:51,343
whose answer to everything that
they fear or misunderstand is "kill it."

872
01:25:51,521 --> 01:25:52,931
I'm an Auror and I don't.

873
01:25:53,106 --> 01:25:55,146
Yes, I know.
That's because you've gone middle head.

874
01:25:56,902 --> 01:25:57,902
Excuse me?

875
01:25:58,695 --> 01:26:01,049
It's an expression derived from
the three heads of the Runespoor.

876
01:26:01,073 --> 01:26:02,473
So the middle one is the visionary.

877
01:26:02,616 --> 01:26:04,936
Now, every Auror in Europe
wants Credence dead, except you.

878
01:26:05,077 --> 01:26:06,283
You've gone middle head.

879
01:26:07,913 --> 01:26:10,655
Who else uses that expression,
Mr. Scamander?

880
01:26:12,167 --> 01:26:13,623
I think it might just be me.

881
01:26:32,062 --> 01:26:35,054
It's Grindelwald.
He's calling his followers.

882
01:27:03,176 --> 01:27:06,293
It's too late.
Grindelwald has come for Credence.

883
01:27:08,265 --> 01:27:10,927
- He might already have him.
- It's not too late.

884
01:27:11,017 --> 01:27:12,598
We can still get to him first.

885
01:27:15,063 --> 01:27:16,143
Where are you going?

886
01:27:16,606 --> 01:27:18,096
The French Ministry of Magic.

887
01:27:18,275 --> 01:27:20,186
That's the last place Credence would go.

888
01:27:20,360 --> 01:27:22,521
There's a box
hidden in the Ministry, Tina.

889
01:27:23,280 --> 01:27:25,280
It's a box that can tell us
who Credence really is.

890
01:27:25,449 --> 01:27:27,690
A box? What are you talking about?

891
01:27:27,951 --> 01:27:28,951
Trust me.

892
01:27:32,622 --> 01:27:34,783
You wanna come out,
just for a little while?

893
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:36,410
You can be free.

894
01:27:45,218 --> 01:27:46,218
Credence.

895
01:27:54,770 --> 01:27:55,770
What do you want?

896
01:27:55,854 --> 01:27:56,854
From you?

897
01:27:58,273 --> 01:27:59,273
Nothing.

898
01:28:02,194 --> 01:28:03,274
For you?

899
01:28:05,322 --> 01:28:07,153
Everything I never had.

900
01:28:08,366 --> 01:28:11,449
But what is it you want, my boy?

901
01:28:12,370 --> 01:28:14,110
I want to know who I am.

902
01:28:23,548 --> 01:28:28,633
This is where you will find proof
of your true identity.

903
01:28:33,558 --> 01:28:38,097
Come to Père Lachaise tonight,
and you will discover the truth.

904
01:28:55,455 --> 01:28:57,446
Father, why did you make me...

905
01:29:00,168 --> 01:29:01,168
Wait...

906
01:29:02,921 --> 01:29:04,331
Wait.

907
01:29:25,777 --> 01:29:28,393
I'm afraid we keep no food in the house.

908
01:29:30,490 --> 01:29:31,946
Are you a ghost?

909
01:29:32,117 --> 01:29:33,197
No.

910
01:29:33,994 --> 01:29:36,235
No. I'm alive.

911
01:29:37,372 --> 01:29:40,239
But I'm an alchemist
and therefore immortal.

912
01:29:42,085 --> 01:29:44,201
You don't look a day over 375.

913
01:29:47,674 --> 01:29:49,289
I'm sorry that we didn't knock.

914
01:29:49,467 --> 01:29:51,298
No. No matter.

915
01:29:51,469 --> 01:29:53,710
Albus told me some friends
might be dropping in.

916
01:29:54,764 --> 01:29:56,220
Nicolas Flamel.

917
01:29:58,018 --> 01:29:59,018
Oh.

918
01:30:00,103 --> 01:30:01,183
Jacob Kowalski.

919
01:30:01,271 --> 01:30:02,306
Oh!

920
01:30:03,940 --> 01:30:04,975
I'm sorry.

921
01:30:05,066 --> 01:30:06,066
It's all right.

922
01:30:06,151 --> 01:30:08,563
- I didn't...
- Oh... Oh!

923
01:30:19,998 --> 01:30:21,989
At last, we see some development.

924
01:30:22,083 --> 01:30:24,574
Yeah. I've seen one of these before.

925
01:30:24,669 --> 01:30:26,785
It was at the fair.

926
01:30:27,005 --> 01:30:28,649
There was this dame there,
and she had a veil,

927
01:30:28,673 --> 01:30:31,961
and I gave her a nickel,
and she told me about my future.

928
01:30:32,594 --> 01:30:35,506
And she missed out
on quite a bit, actually.

929
01:30:39,017 --> 01:30:40,678
Oh. Hey, hey.

930
01:30:42,020 --> 01:30:44,352
Wait a minute, I know him.
That's the kid. That's Credence.

931
01:30:47,150 --> 01:30:48,150
Jeez.

932
01:30:49,861 --> 01:30:51,317
Hey... Hey!

933
01:30:52,656 --> 01:30:55,113
That's Queenie. There she is. Hi, baby.

934
01:30:55,617 --> 01:30:57,778
Where is this? Is this here?

935
01:30:57,869 --> 01:31:00,326
Yes. This is the Lestrange tomb.

936
01:31:00,497 --> 01:31:02,988
It lies in the cemetery
of Père Lachaise.

937
01:31:04,292 --> 01:31:05,998
I'm coming, baby. Stay right there.

938
01:31:06,169 --> 01:31:07,409
Thank you, Mr. Flamel.

939
01:31:07,587 --> 01:31:11,125
- Ouch.
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Okay.

940
01:31:11,299 --> 01:31:14,291
Oh, look after Mr. Tentacles for me.
Oh, no.

941
01:31:14,469 --> 01:31:15,469
I'm sorry. I gotta go.

942
01:31:15,553 --> 01:31:17,433
Please,
you mustn't go to the cemetery.

943
01:31:40,453 --> 01:31:41,659
What's happening?

944
01:31:41,830 --> 01:31:43,510
Exactly what he said
would happen.

945
01:31:44,749 --> 01:31:46,990
Grindelwald rallies
at the cemetery tonight,

946
01:31:47,085 --> 01:31:48,495
and there will be death.

947
01:31:48,670 --> 01:31:49,750
Then you gotta go.

948
01:31:49,838 --> 01:31:52,545
What? I haven't seen action
in 200 years.

949
01:31:52,716 --> 01:31:55,503
Flamel, you can do this.
We believe in you.

950
01:32:04,811 --> 01:32:06,972
The box is in
the Ancestral Records room, Tina.

951
01:32:07,147 --> 01:32:08,557
So it's three floors down.

952
01:32:08,648 --> 01:32:09,683
Is that Polyjuice?

953
01:32:09,858 --> 01:32:11,564
It's just enough to get me inside.

954
01:32:20,618 --> 01:32:22,324
- Who...
- It's my brother, Theseus.

955
01:32:22,871 --> 01:32:25,658
He's an Auror and a hugger.

956
01:32:27,876 --> 01:32:29,036
What's happening?

957
01:32:29,210 --> 01:32:30,245
Grindelwald's rallying.

958
01:32:30,336 --> 01:32:32,176
We don't know where,
but we think it's tonight.

959
01:32:36,676 --> 01:32:38,291
- Be careful.
- Of course.

960
01:32:38,470 --> 01:32:41,070
- Promise me you'll be careful.
- Of course. I'm gonna be careful.

961
01:32:41,848 --> 01:32:43,713
Listen, I want you to hear this from me.

962
01:32:43,892 --> 01:32:45,953
They think that Credence boy
might be your missing brother.

963
01:32:45,977 --> 01:32:47,513
- My brother is dead.
- I know.

964
01:32:47,687 --> 01:32:49,018
- He died.
- I know.

965
01:32:49,189 --> 01:32:51,805
- How many times, Theseus?
- And the records will prove that.

966
01:32:52,484 --> 01:32:55,817
- Okay? They can't lie.
- Theseus.

967
01:33:01,534 --> 01:33:04,367
I want every person at that rally
arrested. If they resist...

968
01:33:04,537 --> 01:33:05,890
Sir, forgive me, but if we go in
too heavy,

969
01:33:05,914 --> 01:33:08,121
- don't we run the risk of adding to...
- Just do it.

970
01:33:25,975 --> 01:33:28,579
I don't suppose you can Disapparate
on Ministry premises in France, can you?

971
01:33:28,603 --> 01:33:29,603
Nope.

972
01:33:30,063 --> 01:33:32,019
Pity.

973
01:33:32,982 --> 01:33:35,064
- Newt!
- Yes, I know. I know it's...

974
01:33:39,739 --> 01:33:40,739
Newt!

975
01:33:42,242 --> 01:33:43,242
Newt!

976
01:33:43,451 --> 01:33:44,987
- Oh!
- That's your brother?

977
01:33:45,078 --> 01:33:46,680
So I think I may have mentioned
in my letters

978
01:33:46,704 --> 01:33:47,848
that we have quite
a complicated relationship.

979
01:33:47,872 --> 01:33:49,157
Newt, stop!

980
01:33:49,332 --> 01:33:50,852
- Does he wanna kill you?
- Frequently.

981
01:33:51,751 --> 01:33:52,831
Enough!

982
01:33:59,717 --> 01:34:01,332
He needs to control his temper.

983
01:34:06,516 --> 01:34:08,757
I think that might have been
the best moment of my life.

984
01:34:53,479 --> 01:34:54,479
Queenie.

985
01:34:59,527 --> 01:35:00,767
Queenie, honey.

986
01:35:03,781 --> 01:35:06,363
Don't. Don't move.

987
01:35:16,753 --> 01:35:18,618
Yes, this is Leta Lestrange.

988
01:35:22,717 --> 01:35:24,833
And, uh, I'm her...

989
01:35:25,011 --> 01:35:26,126
Fiancé.

990
01:35:31,768 --> 01:35:33,099
Thank you.

991
01:35:45,114 --> 01:35:46,900
Tina, about that fiancée business...

992
01:35:47,075 --> 01:35:49,282
Oh, sorry. Yeah, I should have
congratulated you.

993
01:35:49,452 --> 01:35:51,113
- No, that's...
- Lumos.

994
01:35:54,040 --> 01:35:55,371
Lestrange.

995
01:36:02,215 --> 01:36:03,671
Tina, about Leta...

996
01:36:03,841 --> 01:36:05,797
Yes, I've just said I am happy for you.

997
01:36:05,969 --> 01:36:08,335
No, I don't... Please, don't be happy.

998
01:36:10,556 --> 01:36:12,137
No. Sorry. I don't...

999
01:36:13,226 --> 01:36:15,012
Obviously, I...

1000
01:36:15,103 --> 01:36:16,764
Obviously, I want you to be...

1001
01:36:17,689 --> 01:36:21,102
And I hear that you are now.
Which is wonderful.

1002
01:36:22,694 --> 01:36:25,606
Sorry, what I'm trying to say is,
I want you to be happy,

1003
01:36:25,697 --> 01:36:28,564
but I don't want you to be happy
that I'm happy, because I'm not.

1004
01:36:31,911 --> 01:36:33,526
Happy.

1005
01:36:33,997 --> 01:36:35,203
Or engaged.

1006
01:36:37,083 --> 01:36:39,119
- What?
- It was a mistake in a stupid magazine.

1007
01:36:39,210 --> 01:36:41,075
My brother's marrying Leta,
June the 6th.

1008
01:36:41,254 --> 01:36:42,869
I'm supposed to be best man,

1009
01:36:43,756 --> 01:36:45,667
which is sort of mildly hilarious.

1010
01:36:46,801 --> 01:36:48,883
Does he think you're here
to win her back?

1011
01:36:51,889 --> 01:36:53,299
Are you here to win her back?

1012
01:36:53,474 --> 01:36:54,805
No, I'm here...

1013
01:36:59,063 --> 01:37:01,270
You know, your eyes really are...

1014
01:37:04,110 --> 01:37:05,441
Are what?

1015
01:37:06,487 --> 01:37:08,102
I'm not supposed to say.

1016
01:37:12,118 --> 01:37:13,387
- I cut a picture of you...
- Newt, I read your book and...

1017
01:37:13,411 --> 01:37:14,901
- Wait, did you read...
- Did you?

1018
01:37:20,752 --> 01:37:21,832
I cut this, um...

1019
01:37:22,879 --> 01:37:25,666
It's just a picture of you
from the paper,

1020
01:37:26,341 --> 01:37:29,003
but it's interesting
'cause your eyes in newsprint...

1021
01:37:31,262 --> 01:37:34,504
See, in reality they have
this effect in them, Tina. It's like...

1022
01:37:35,183 --> 01:37:37,890
It's like fire in water, in dark water.

1023
01:37:41,439 --> 01:37:43,430
And I've only ever seen that...

1024
01:37:46,069 --> 01:37:48,526
I've only ever seen that in...

1025
01:37:52,742 --> 01:37:54,152
Salamanders.

1026
01:37:58,664 --> 01:37:59,664
Come.

1027
01:38:05,505 --> 01:38:06,505
Lestrange.

1028
01:38:11,677 --> 01:38:12,712
Whoa!

1029
01:39:10,111 --> 01:39:11,351
Circumrota.

1030
01:39:22,415 --> 01:39:23,495
Hello, Newt.

1031
01:39:28,129 --> 01:39:29,244
Hello, Leta.

1032
01:39:33,551 --> 01:39:34,551
Hi.

1033
01:39:37,805 --> 01:39:38,920
Oh, no.

1034
01:39:44,228 --> 01:39:45,684
What kind of cats are those?

1035
01:39:45,855 --> 01:39:47,015
Uh, these aren't cats.

1036
01:39:47,064 --> 01:39:49,305
They're Matagots.
They're spirit familiars.

1037
01:39:49,400 --> 01:39:51,140
They guard the Ministry.

1038
01:39:51,360 --> 01:39:52,840
But they won't hurt you unless you...

1039
01:39:52,987 --> 01:39:54,318
Stupefy!

1040
01:39:55,531 --> 01:39:56,566
Unless you attack them.

1041
01:39:57,408 --> 01:39:58,408
Oops.

1042
01:39:58,784 --> 01:40:00,399
- Leta.
- Reverte.

1043
01:40:26,646 --> 01:40:27,646
Accio!

1044
01:40:39,283 --> 01:40:40,318
Ascendio!

1045
01:41:30,167 --> 01:41:32,158
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

1046
01:41:33,879 --> 01:41:36,791
Okay. Wait. Hold it there, please.

1047
01:41:38,259 --> 01:41:39,419
Come on.

1048
01:41:40,678 --> 01:41:42,043
Oh!

1049
01:41:42,138 --> 01:41:43,298
All right.

1050
01:41:46,934 --> 01:41:48,214
Okay, wait.

1051
01:42:02,408 --> 01:42:04,820
You, go back.
Move! Out of the way!

1052
01:42:06,537 --> 01:42:08,744
If I must kill you as well as Corvus,
I shall.

1053
01:42:09,957 --> 01:42:10,957
Stop!

1054
01:42:15,421 --> 01:42:16,421
Yusuf.

1055
01:42:17,923 --> 01:42:19,538
Is that really you?

1056
01:42:25,598 --> 01:42:27,338
My little sister?

1057
01:42:29,810 --> 01:42:31,721
So he's your brother.

1058
01:42:33,522 --> 01:42:35,012
Who am I?

1059
01:42:36,108 --> 01:42:37,108
I don't know.

1060
01:42:37,276 --> 01:42:39,813
I'm tired of living with no name
and no history.

1061
01:42:42,782 --> 01:42:45,364
Just tell me my story,
then you can end it.

1062
01:42:45,534 --> 01:42:47,195
Your story is our story.

1063
01:42:50,998 --> 01:42:54,115
- Our story.
- No, Yusuf.

1064
01:43:10,518 --> 01:43:13,055
My father was Mustafa Kama.

1065
01:43:13,646 --> 01:43:17,138
Pure-blood of Senegalese descent
and most accomplished.

1066
01:43:18,442 --> 01:43:20,148
My mother, Laurena,

1067
01:43:21,612 --> 01:43:24,354
was equally highbred, a noted beauty.

1068
01:43:25,908 --> 01:43:27,148
They were deeply in love.

1069
01:43:29,245 --> 01:43:33,409
They knew a man of great influence
from a famous French pure-blood family.

1070
01:43:35,584 --> 01:43:37,120
He desired her.

1071
01:43:37,712 --> 01:43:40,545
Maman. Maman!

1072
01:43:41,215 --> 01:43:46,130
Lestrange used the Imperius Curse
to seduce and abduct her.

1073
01:43:47,471 --> 01:43:50,053
I tried to prevent it,
but he attacked me.

1074
01:43:51,809 --> 01:43:53,720
That was the last time I ever saw her.

1075
01:43:56,355 --> 01:43:59,643
She died giving birth to a little girl.

1076
01:44:01,277 --> 01:44:02,437
You.

1077
01:44:05,823 --> 01:44:09,907
The news of her death
drove my father insane.

1078
01:44:10,703 --> 01:44:12,193
With his dying breath,

1079
01:44:13,164 --> 01:44:16,873
my father charged me to seek revenge.

1080
01:44:18,961 --> 01:44:21,418
Kill the person Lestrange loves
best in the world.

1081
01:44:22,590 --> 01:44:24,626
I thought at first it'd be easy.

1082
01:44:25,593 --> 01:44:27,458
He had only one close relative.

1083
01:44:28,596 --> 01:44:29,802
You.

1084
01:44:29,972 --> 01:44:31,052
But he...

1085
01:44:31,515 --> 01:44:32,721
Say it.

1086
01:44:33,642 --> 01:44:35,257
He never loved you.

1087
01:44:39,482 --> 01:44:42,440
He remarried,
and not three months after her death.

1088
01:44:46,280 --> 01:44:48,441
He loved her no more
than he had loved you.

1089
01:44:52,495 --> 01:44:56,989
But then his son, Corvus,
was born at last.

1090
01:44:57,166 --> 01:45:01,830
And that man who had never known love
was filled with it.

1091
01:45:02,379 --> 01:45:04,210
All he cared about

1092
01:45:04,799 --> 01:45:06,335
was little Corvus.

1093
01:45:09,845 --> 01:45:11,551
So this is the truth?

1094
01:45:12,973 --> 01:45:14,804
I am Corvus Lestrange?

1095
01:45:14,975 --> 01:45:16,806
- Yes. Yes.
- No. No.

1096
01:45:16,977 --> 01:45:20,390
Realizing that Mustafa Kama's
son had sworn revenge,

1097
01:45:20,481 --> 01:45:23,143
your father sought to hide you
where I couldn't find you.

1098
01:45:24,151 --> 01:45:28,440
So he confided you to his servant,
who boarded a ship for America.

1099
01:45:28,614 --> 01:45:31,651
- He did send Corvus to America, but...
- His servant, Irma Dugard,

1100
01:45:32,284 --> 01:45:33,615
was a half-elf.

1101
01:45:34,161 --> 01:45:35,492
Her magic was weak,

1102
01:45:35,663 --> 01:45:37,745
and therefore left no trace
I could follow.

1103
01:45:40,084 --> 01:45:43,201
I had only just discovered
how you had escaped

1104
01:45:43,379 --> 01:45:45,586
when I received news I never expected.

1105
01:45:46,090 --> 01:45:48,752
The ship had gone down at sea.

1106
01:45:49,385 --> 01:45:51,000
But you survived, didn't you?

1107
01:45:52,263 --> 01:45:55,255
Somehow, someone had pulled you
from the water.

1108
01:45:56,433 --> 01:45:58,924
"A son cruelly banished
Despair of the daughter

1109
01:45:59,103 --> 01:46:01,810
"Return, great avenger,
With wings from the water."

1110
01:46:02,273 --> 01:46:04,639
There stands the despairing daughter.

1111
01:46:04,817 --> 01:46:08,230
You are the winged raven,
returned from the sea,

1112
01:46:10,656 --> 01:46:12,362
but I'm the avenger of my family's ruin.

1113
01:46:15,119 --> 01:46:16,734
I pity you, Corvus.

1114
01:46:18,706 --> 01:46:20,116
But you must die.

1115
01:46:20,291 --> 01:46:23,203
Corvus Lestrange is already dead!
I killed him!

1116
01:46:29,675 --> 01:46:30,675
Accio!

1117
01:46:48,652 --> 01:46:51,735
My father owned
a very strange family tree.

1118
01:46:55,367 --> 01:46:57,107
It only recorded the men.

1119
01:47:01,624 --> 01:47:03,865
The women in my family
were recorded as flowers.

1120
01:47:07,171 --> 01:47:08,331
Beautiful.

1121
01:47:10,591 --> 01:47:11,751
Separate.

1122
01:47:14,428 --> 01:47:16,464
My father sent me to America
with Corvus.

1123
01:47:22,686 --> 01:47:25,393
Irma was to pose as a grandmother
with two grandchildren.

1124
01:47:31,153 --> 01:47:33,235
Corvus never stopped crying.

1125
01:47:37,826 --> 01:47:39,111
Do you have any news?

1126
01:47:39,286 --> 01:47:40,901
All hands to station!

1127
01:47:41,705 --> 01:47:43,536
Run to station!

1128
01:47:52,007 --> 01:47:54,247
I never wanted to hurt him.

1129
01:47:59,515 --> 01:48:01,380
I only wanted to be free of him.

1130
01:48:02,184 --> 01:48:03,594
Just for a moment.

1131
01:48:09,066 --> 01:48:11,102
Just a single moment.

1132
01:48:16,490 --> 01:48:17,980
Give him to me.

1133
01:48:19,034 --> 01:48:20,649
Everyone, to the lifeboats!

1134
01:48:20,744 --> 01:48:22,530
They want us
to put on life jackets.

1135
01:49:22,139 --> 01:49:24,050
You didn't mean to do it, Leta.

1136
01:49:26,435 --> 01:49:28,175
So it wasn't your fault.

1137
01:49:30,773 --> 01:49:32,138
Oh, Newt.

1138
01:49:36,653 --> 01:49:38,769
You never met a monster
you couldn't love.

1139
01:49:43,786 --> 01:49:44,786
Leta...

1140
01:49:45,871 --> 01:49:47,782
Do you know who Credence really is?

1141
01:49:49,374 --> 01:49:51,740
Did you know when you swapped them?

1142
01:49:51,835 --> 01:49:52,950
No.

1143
01:50:16,026 --> 01:50:17,106
Queenie?

1144
01:50:44,596 --> 01:50:45,927
They're pure-bloods.

1145
01:50:46,265 --> 01:50:47,801
They kill the likes of us for sport.

1146
01:50:50,519 --> 01:50:51,554
Queenie?

1147
01:50:51,645 --> 01:50:53,351
Jacob!

1148
01:50:53,438 --> 01:50:55,269
Honey, you're here! Hi!

1149
01:50:55,440 --> 01:50:56,725
Hi, hon. Hi.

1150
01:50:57,317 --> 01:50:59,228
Oh, honey, I'm so sorry.

1151
01:50:59,403 --> 01:51:01,519
I never should have done it.
I love you so much.

1152
01:51:01,697 --> 01:51:03,608
And you know that I love you, right?

1153
01:51:03,782 --> 01:51:05,864
- Yeah.
- Good. Let's get the hell outta here.

1154
01:51:06,034 --> 01:51:07,820
Oh, no, wait a second.

1155
01:51:10,038 --> 01:51:13,530
I just thought maybe we could
hear him first.

1156
01:51:13,625 --> 01:51:15,741
Just listen. That's all.

1157
01:51:16,879 --> 01:51:18,119
What are you talking about?

1158
01:51:23,468 --> 01:51:24,628
It's a trap.

1159
01:51:25,137 --> 01:51:26,137
Yeah.

1160
01:51:27,639 --> 01:51:29,595
Queenie, the family tree.

1161
01:51:29,766 --> 01:51:30,801
It's all been bait.

1162
01:51:32,436 --> 01:51:34,518
We have to find a way out of here
right now.

1163
01:51:36,398 --> 01:51:37,729
You go find the others.

1164
01:51:37,816 --> 01:51:39,101
What are you gonna do?

1165
01:51:39,776 --> 01:51:41,266
I'll think of something.

1166
01:52:29,660 --> 01:52:32,993
My brothers, my sisters,

1167
01:52:34,581 --> 01:52:35,696
my friends,

1168
01:52:36,667 --> 01:52:40,501
the great gift of your applause
is not for me. No.

1169
01:52:41,505 --> 01:52:43,746
It is for yourselves.

1170
01:52:46,260 --> 01:52:48,296
You came today because of a craving

1171
01:52:50,597 --> 01:52:52,007
and a knowledge

1172
01:52:53,725 --> 01:52:56,683
that the old ways serve us no longer.

1173
01:52:59,815 --> 01:53:03,649
You came today because you crave
something new.

1174
01:53:05,529 --> 01:53:06,769
Something different.

1175
01:53:09,533 --> 01:53:10,864
It is said

1176
01:53:11,326 --> 01:53:14,693
that I hate les non-Magiques.

1177
01:53:15,831 --> 01:53:17,071
The Muggles.

1178
01:53:17,249 --> 01:53:19,080
- Vermin!
- The No-Maj.

1179
01:53:20,210 --> 01:53:21,791
The Can't-Spells.

1180
01:53:23,672 --> 01:53:25,378
I do not hate them.

1181
01:53:26,300 --> 01:53:27,631
I do not.

1182
01:53:29,344 --> 01:53:31,460
For I do not fight out of hatred.

1183
01:53:34,057 --> 01:53:37,641
I say the Muggles are not lesser,

1184
01:53:38,645 --> 01:53:39,930
but other.

1185
01:53:40,897 --> 01:53:42,228
Not worthless,

1186
01:53:43,817 --> 01:53:45,478
but of other value.

1187
01:53:46,695 --> 01:53:50,859
Not disposable,
but of a different disposition.

1188
01:53:52,117 --> 01:53:54,108
Magic blooms

1189
01:53:56,204 --> 01:53:59,196
only in rare souls.

1190
01:54:01,251 --> 01:54:05,335
It is granted to those
who live for higher things.

1191
01:54:06,340 --> 01:54:09,673
Oh, and what a world we would make
for all of humanity.

1192
01:54:09,843 --> 01:54:12,550
We who live for freedom,

1193
01:54:14,139 --> 01:54:15,299
for truth,

1194
01:54:17,934 --> 01:54:19,174
and for love.

1195
01:54:29,529 --> 01:54:31,269
It isn't illegal to listen to him.

1196
01:54:32,407 --> 01:54:34,022
Use minimum force on the crowd.

1197
01:54:35,786 --> 01:54:37,401
We mustn't be what he says we are.

1198
01:54:43,335 --> 01:54:48,045
The moment has come
to share my vision of the future

1199
01:54:49,841 --> 01:54:53,129
that awaits if we do not rise up

1200
01:54:54,888 --> 01:54:59,928
and take our rightful place
in the world.

1201
01:55:43,979 --> 01:55:45,640
Not another war.

1202
01:55:50,944 --> 01:55:54,653
That is what we are fighting.

1203
01:55:55,991 --> 01:55:57,356
That is the enemy.

1204
01:55:59,327 --> 01:56:00,567
Their arrogance.

1205
01:56:02,080 --> 01:56:03,786
Their power lust.

1206
01:56:06,042 --> 01:56:07,452
Their barbarity.

1207
01:56:09,337 --> 01:56:13,125
How long will it take
before they turn their weapons on us?

1208
01:56:15,552 --> 01:56:17,793
Do nothing when I speak of this.

1209
01:56:18,972 --> 01:56:20,678
You must remain calm

1210
01:56:22,976 --> 01:56:24,762
and contain your emotions.

1211
01:56:29,274 --> 01:56:31,265
There are Aurors here among us.

1212
01:56:41,828 --> 01:56:44,319
Come closer, brother wizards. Join us.

1213
01:56:46,082 --> 01:56:47,242
Do nothing.

1214
01:56:48,502 --> 01:56:49,787
And no force.

1215
01:57:05,519 --> 01:57:08,636
They have killed
many of my followers.

1216
01:57:09,439 --> 01:57:10,599
It is true.

1217
01:57:11,858 --> 01:57:16,067
They confined me
and tortured me in New York.

1218
01:57:17,614 --> 01:57:21,482
They had struck down
their fellow witches and wizards.

1219
01:57:23,119 --> 01:57:27,533
For the simple crime
of seeking the truth.

1220
01:57:29,292 --> 01:57:31,078
For wanting freedom.

1221
01:57:35,799 --> 01:57:39,337
Your anger, your desire for revenge
is natural.

1222
01:57:43,265 --> 01:57:44,265
No!

1223
01:58:15,297 --> 01:58:18,881
Take this young warrior
back to her family.

1224
01:58:27,058 --> 01:58:28,218
Disapparate.

1225
01:58:28,893 --> 01:58:30,008
Leave.

1226
01:58:31,062 --> 01:58:34,054
Go forth from this place
and spread the word.

1227
01:58:35,400 --> 01:58:38,608
It is not we who are violent.

1228
01:58:56,755 --> 01:58:57,961
Let's take him.

1229
01:59:27,077 --> 01:59:30,865
Aurors, join me in this circle.

1230
01:59:32,707 --> 01:59:34,117
Pledge to me

1231
01:59:35,377 --> 01:59:36,913
your eternal allegiance,

1232
01:59:37,837 --> 01:59:38,917
or die.

1233
01:59:39,589 --> 01:59:41,454
Only here shall you know freedom.

1234
01:59:42,050 --> 01:59:44,587
Only here shall you know yourself.

1235
01:59:47,889 --> 01:59:50,505
Move! Run! Run!

1236
01:59:51,726 --> 01:59:53,808
Play by the rules!

1237
01:59:53,978 --> 01:59:56,594
No cheating, children.

1238
02:00:01,403 --> 02:00:02,984
He knows who I am.

1239
02:00:03,154 --> 02:00:06,521
He knows what you were born,
not who you are!

1240
02:00:06,616 --> 02:00:07,696
Credence!

1241
02:00:22,882 --> 02:00:25,419
Queenie, honey. Queenie.
You gotta wake up.

1242
02:00:27,178 --> 02:00:28,258
Jacob.

1243
02:00:29,097 --> 02:00:30,337
He's the answer.

1244
02:00:30,724 --> 02:00:31,759
He wants what we want.

1245
02:00:31,933 --> 02:00:33,298
- No.
- Yeah.

1246
02:00:43,278 --> 02:00:46,236
This has all been for you, Credence.

1247
02:00:49,200 --> 02:00:50,610
Walk with me.

1248
02:00:52,328 --> 02:00:54,034
Hon. No!

1249
02:00:54,205 --> 02:00:55,741
Walk with me!

1250
02:00:57,751 --> 02:00:59,161
You're crazy.

1251
02:01:01,588 --> 02:01:02,588
Queenie.

1252
02:01:03,214 --> 02:01:04,214
No!

1253
02:01:04,382 --> 02:01:05,997
Queenie, don't do it!

1254
02:01:14,017 --> 02:01:15,017
Queenie.

1255
02:01:17,687 --> 02:01:18,687
Queenie!

1256
02:01:36,414 --> 02:01:37,904
Mr. Scamander.

1257
02:01:37,999 --> 02:01:42,163
Do you think Dumbledore
will mourn for you?

1258
02:01:52,430 --> 02:01:54,591
Grindelwald! Stop!

1259
02:02:02,148 --> 02:02:03,148
Leta...

1260
02:02:13,910 --> 02:02:16,196
This one I believe I know.

1261
02:02:17,163 --> 02:02:18,903
Leta Lestrange.

1262
02:02:20,083 --> 02:02:25,544
Despised entirely amongst wizards,
unloved, mistreated,

1263
02:02:27,131 --> 02:02:31,215
yet brave, so very brave.

1264
02:02:36,349 --> 02:02:37,964
Time to come home.

1265
02:02:56,119 --> 02:02:57,359
I love you.

1266
02:03:06,629 --> 02:03:07,709
Go!

1267
02:03:08,715 --> 02:03:09,715
Go!

1268
02:03:33,531 --> 02:03:35,192
I hate Paris.

1269
02:04:15,073 --> 02:04:16,153
Together, in a circle.

1270
02:04:16,324 --> 02:04:17,734
Your wand into the earth.

1271
02:04:18,910 --> 02:04:21,117
Or all Paris will be destroyed.

1272
02:04:28,086 --> 02:04:29,576
Finite!

1273
02:04:31,464 --> 02:04:32,464
Finite!

1274
02:04:32,924 --> 02:04:33,924
Finite!

1275
02:04:35,343 --> 02:04:36,343
Finite!

1276
02:06:46,099 --> 02:06:47,930
I've chosen my side.

1277
02:07:06,244 --> 02:07:07,484
Oh.

1278
02:07:09,163 --> 02:07:10,528
Come here.

1279
02:07:11,040 --> 02:07:13,531
I've got you. I've got you.

1280
02:07:58,421 --> 02:08:00,833
I think it's best
if he speaks to him alone.

1281
02:08:34,999 --> 02:08:36,864
Is he frightened of me still?

1282
02:08:38,377 --> 02:08:40,038
You need to be careful.

1283
02:08:41,047 --> 02:08:43,254
He's not sure he made the right choice.

1284
02:08:44,675 --> 02:08:47,667
Be very gentle with him.

1285
02:08:53,184 --> 02:08:55,175
I have a gift for you, my boy.

1286
02:09:07,615 --> 02:09:09,025
Is it true?

1287
02:09:09,992 --> 02:09:11,198
About Leta?

1288
02:09:12,745 --> 02:09:13,745
Yes.

1289
02:09:16,499 --> 02:09:18,080
I'm so sorry.

1290
02:09:24,757 --> 02:09:26,918
It's a blood pact, isn't it?

1291
02:09:29,887 --> 02:09:31,969
You swore not to fight each other.

1292
02:09:39,355 --> 02:09:42,643
How in the name of Merlin
did you manage to get...

1293
02:09:46,195 --> 02:09:48,026
Grindelwald doesn't seem to understand

1294
02:09:48,114 --> 02:09:50,605
the nature of the things
he considers simple.

1295
02:10:06,716 --> 02:10:08,047
Can you destroy it?

1296
02:10:08,217 --> 02:10:09,457
Maybe.

1297
02:10:11,595 --> 02:10:12,835
Maybe.

1298
02:10:19,020 --> 02:10:20,885
Would he like a cup of tea?

1299
02:10:21,897 --> 02:10:23,307
He'll have some milk.

1300
02:10:25,735 --> 02:10:27,475
Hide the teaspoons.

1301
02:10:33,409 --> 02:10:38,278
You have suffered
the most heinous of betrayals,

1302
02:10:39,498 --> 02:10:43,411
most purposely bestowed upon you
by your own blood.

1303
02:10:43,502 --> 02:10:45,709
Your own flesh and blood.

1304
02:10:46,547 --> 02:10:49,459
And just as
he has celebrated your torment,

1305
02:10:51,719 --> 02:10:55,553
your brother seeks to destroy you.

1306
02:11:16,535 --> 02:11:20,153
There is a legend in your family
that a phoenix will come to any member

1307
02:11:20,373 --> 02:11:22,079
who is in dire need.

1308
02:11:29,673 --> 02:11:31,959
It is your birthright, my boy.

1309
02:11:36,263 --> 02:11:37,423
As is

1310
02:11:39,058 --> 02:11:41,470
the name I now restore to you.

1311
02:11:44,230 --> 02:11:45,640
Aurelius.

1312
02:11:47,108 --> 02:11:49,895
Aurelius Dumbledore.

1313
02:11:51,612 --> 02:11:56,447
We will go down in history together
as we remake this world.
