纽约 1927

9
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:37,720
You'll be glad to be rid of him, I expect.

10
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:37,720
你很开心能够摆脱他吧  我想

11
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:40,470
We'd be more than happy to keep him here in custody.

12
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:40,470
我们更希望他能够继续在牢里关着

13
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,520
Six months are enough.

14
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,520
六个月已经足够了

15
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:45,520
It's time for him to answer for his crimes in Europe.

16
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:45,520
他是时候为他在欧洲犯下的罪行担上责任了

17
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:48,810
President Picquery, Mr. Spielman, sir.

18
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:48,810
皮克科瑞主席 斯皮尔曼先生

19
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:52,280
Prisoner is secured and ready to travel.

20
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:52,280
犯人已经准备好转移了

21
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:59,740
You've thrown everything at him, I see.

22
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:59,740
你们把能用的招都用上了

23
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:02,790
It was necessary. He's extremely powerful.

24
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:02,790
这很有必要 他太强大了

25
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,790
We've had to change his guard three times, he's very... persuasive.

26
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,790
我们换了三次守卫 他嘴皮子非常厉害

27
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:10,750
So we removed his tongue.

28
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:10,750
所以我们割掉了他的舌头

29
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:20,430
Grindelwald! Grindelwald!

30
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:20,430
格林德沃 格林德沃

31
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:27,060
Grindelwald! Grindelwald!

32
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:27,060
格林德沃 格林德沃

33
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:40,990
The wizarding community worldwide owes you a great debt, Madam President.

34
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:40,990
全球的巫师界都欠你一个人情 主席女士

35
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,200
Do not underestimate him.

36
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,200
不要小看他

37
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:50,580
Mr. Spielman, we found his wand hidden away.

38
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:50,580
斯皮尔曼先生 我们刚发现他藏起来的魔杖

39
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:54,670
Abernathy?

40
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:54,670
阿伯内西

41
00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:58,220
And we found this.

42
00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:58,220
我们还找到这个

43
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:51,940
No more silver tongue, hmm?

44
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:51,940
还油嘴滑舌吗 嗯?

45
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:08,820
You have joined a noble cause, my friend.

46
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:08,820
我的朋友 你加入了一项高尚的事业

47
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:22,630
I know. I know. I know, Antonio

48
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:22,630
安东尼奥 我知道 我知道

49
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:30,510
So needy.

50
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:30,510
太饥渴了

51
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:24,020
神奇动物：格林德沃之罪 加长版

52
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,840
英国伦敦

53
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:02,560
英国魔法部

54
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:06,400
三个月后

55
00:08:39,930 --> 00:08:41,770
They're ready for you, Newt.

56
00:08:39,930 --> 00:08:41,770
他们准备好了 纽特

57
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:45,190
Leta…

58
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:45,190
莉塔

59
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,980
What are you doing here?

60
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,980
你在这里做什么

61
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:52,740
Theseus thought it would be good if I became part of the Ministry family.

62
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:52,740
忒修斯认为我成为魔法部大家族的一员是个很好的主意

63
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,820
Did he actually say the words “Ministry family”?

64
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,820
他真的用了“大家族”这个词吗

65
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:58,580
That sounds like my brother

66
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:58,580
不愧是他

67
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:18,300
Theseus was disappointed you couldn't come to dinner.

68
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:18,300
你没来吃晚餐 忒修斯很失望

69
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:21,220
Any of the nights we've asked you.

70
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:21,220
每次问你你都没空

71
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:23,230
Well, I've been busy.

72
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:23,230
我一直很忙

73
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:24,680
He's your brother, Newt.

74
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:24,680
他是你的哥哥 纽特

75
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:26,140
He likes spending time with you.

76
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:26,140
他喜欢跟你在一起

77
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:29,110
And so do I.

78
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:29,110
我也是

79
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,030
Oi, you! Hop in, Pick.

80
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,030
嘿 皮克 跳进来

81
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:40,530
Why do strange creatures love you so much?

82
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:40,530
为什么那些奇奇怪怪的生物那么喜欢你

83
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:44,120
Well, there are no strange creatures... - Only blinkered people!

84
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:44,120
唔  没有什么奇奇怪怪的生物... -只有心胸狭隘的人

85
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:51,130
How long did you get in detention for saying that to Prendergast?

86
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:51,130
你说完这个之后被普伦德加斯特留堂了多久

87
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:53,630
You know, I think it was a month that time.

88
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:53,630
好像是一个月吧 那一次

89
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:57,130
And I set off a Dung bomb under his desk so I could join you, do you remember?

90
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:57,130
记得吗 我为了跟你一起还在他桌子底下设了个粪蛋

91
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:05,890
No, I actually don't remember that.

92
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:05,890
不是很记得了

93
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,600
Hello.

94
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,600
你们好啊

95
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:11,570
Theseus. We were just talking about Newt coming for dinner

96
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:11,570
忒修斯 我们刚才在说纽特会来一起享用晚餐

97
00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:13,070
Really? Well…

98
00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:13,070
喔 真的吗

99
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:15,860
Look, before we go in there I

100
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:15,860
听着 在我们进去之前 我...

101
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:18,030
It's my fifth attempt, Theseus. I know the form.

102
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:18,030
忒修斯 这都第五次了 我知道程序

103
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:20,660
This isn't going to be like the other times. This is…

104
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:20,660
这次跟其他的不一样 这次...

105
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:23,870
Just try and keep an open mind, will you?

106
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:23,870
心态尽量放开点 好吗

107
00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:27,310
And maybe a little less. - Like me?

108
00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:27,310
然后尽量不要那么… -像我自己

109
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:30,210
Well, it can't hurt.

110
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:30,210
又不会少一块肉

111
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:32,250
Come on. Let's go.

112
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:32,250
嘿 进来吧

113
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,090
Hearing commences…

114
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,090
听证会开始

115
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:46,390
You want an end to the ban on your traveling internationally. Why?

116
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:46,390
你希望我们终止对你国际旅行的禁令 为什么呢

117
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:49,190
Because I like to travel internationally.

118
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:49,190
因为我喜欢国际旅行

119
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:54,400
Subject uncooperative and evasive on reasons for last international trip.

120
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:54,400
申请人拒绝合作并刻意回避回答上次国际旅行的原因

121
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:56,530
It was a field trip.

122
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:56,530
那次只是一次实地考察

123
00:10:56,610 --> 00:10:59,610
So I was collecting material for my book on magical beasts

124
00:10:56,610 --> 00:10:59,610
我在为我关于神奇动物的书收集资料

125
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:01,070
You destroyed half of New York.

126
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:01,070
你毁了半个纽约

127
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:04,120
-No, that's actually factually incorrect on two counts

128
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:04,120
-不对 实际上有两个方面不正确 -纽特

129
00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:09,670
Mr. Scamander, it's clear you're frustrated and

130
00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:09,670
斯卡曼德先生 显然你很困扰

131
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:12,420
frankly, so are we

132
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:12,420
坦白说, 我们也是

133
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:18,090
In the spirit of compromise, we'd like to make a proposition.

134
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:18,090
折中一点 我们想达成一个协议

135
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:19,930
What kind of proposition?

136
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:19,930
什么样的协议

137
00:11:20,090 --> 00:11:23,760
The committee will agree to lift your travel ban under one condition.

138
00:11:20,090 --> 00:11:23,760
答应一个条件 委员会就终止你的旅行禁令

139
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:25,760
You join the Ministry.

140
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:25,760
你加入魔法部

141
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:29,600
Specifically, your brother's department.

142
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:29,600
准确来说 加入你哥哥的部门

143
00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:33,730
No.

144
00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:33,730
不行

145
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:39,400
I…I think that… Theseus is the Auror

146
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:39,400
我觉得忒修斯比较适合做傲罗

147
00:11:40,090 --> 00:11:41,570
I think my talents lie elsewhere.

148
00:11:40,090 --> 00:11:41,570
我认为我另有所长

149
00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:44,270
Mr. Scamander, The wizarding and non-wizarding

150
00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:44,270
斯卡曼德先生 巫师和非巫师世界的和平

151
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:46,810
worlds have been at peace for over a century.

152
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:46,810
已经持续了一个多世纪了

153
00:11:47,330 --> 00:11:49,910
Grindelwald wants to see that peace destroyed.

154
00:11:47,330 --> 00:11:49,910
格林德沃想摧毁这份和平

155
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:52,790
And for certain members of our community

156
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:52,790
对于我们社会的某些人来说

157
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:55,460
his message is very seductive

158
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:55,460
他的思想是十分吸引人的

159
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:00,300
Many pure-bloods believe it is their birthright to rule

160
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:00,300
很多纯血认为他们生为统治者

161
00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:05,010
not only our world but the non-magic world as well.

162
00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:05,010
不只是在巫师界 在麻瓜世界亦是

163
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:08,560
They see Grindelwald as their hero,

164
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:08,560
他们认格林德沃为领导者

165
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:11,600
and Grindelwald sees this boy

166
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:11,600
而格林德沃将这个男孩

167
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:14,860
as a means to make this all come true.

168
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:14,860
看作能使这一切成为现实的手段

169
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:19,780
I'm sorry. You're talking about Credence as if he were still here.

170
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:19,780
抱歉 你说的好像克雷登斯还在世一样

171
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:22,610
He survived, Newt.

172
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:22,610
纽特 他活了下来

173
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:25,950
He is still alive.

174
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:25,950
他还活着

175
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:28,580
He left New York months ago.

176
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:28,580
几个月前他离开了纽约

177
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:31,960
He's somewhere in Europe. Where exactly, we don't know, but…

178
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:31,960
他在欧洲的某个地方 我们不知道确切地点 但是...

179
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:34,250
And you want me to hunt Credence down?

180
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:34,250
你们希望我去抓他

181
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:36,630
To kill him?

182
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:36,630
去杀了他?

183
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:39,050
Same old Scamander.

184
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:39,050
还是老样子啊 斯卡曼德

185
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:43,090
What's he doing here?

186
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:43,090
他在这里干什么

187
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:46,390
Taking on the job you're too soft to do.

188
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:46,390
接手软弱的你不敢做的任务

189
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:51,600
Is that it?

190
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:51,600
就这样吗?

191
00:12:55,810 --> 00:12:58,440
Travel documentation denied.

192
00:12:55,810 --> 00:12:58,440
拒绝通过旅行档案

193
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:01,650
Newt!

194
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:01,650
纽特

195
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:05,660
You think I like the idea of Grimmson any more than you do?

196
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:05,660
你以为我会喜欢格里姆森的主意吗

197
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:07,620
Listen, I don't want to hear how the ends justify the means, Theseus.

198
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:07,620
听着 忒修斯 我不想听什么结果胜于手段如何如何

199
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:09,240
I think you're gonna have to pull your head out of the sand!

200
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:09,240
你不能再像鸵鸟把自己的头埋在沙子里似的逃避现实

201
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:11,790
Okay, right, here we go. What a selfish... irresponsible…

202
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:11,790
啊, 对, 又来了. 多么自私...不负责任...

203
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:14,710
You know, the time is coming when everyone’s

204
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:14,710
那个时代快来临了 每一个人

205
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:17,170
everyone's gonna have to pick a side.

206
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:17,170
每一个人 都要选边站

207
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:18,540
Even you.

208
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:18,540
连你也一样

209
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:21,210
I don't do sides.

210
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:21,210
我不站边的

211
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:27,720
Newt. Newt.

212
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:27,720
纽特 纽特

213
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:34,480
C’mere.

214
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:34,480
过来

215
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:43,280
They are watching you.

216
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:43,280
他们时时刻刻都在盯着你

217
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:56,120
Well, gentlemen.

218
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:56,120
好吧 先生们

219
00:13:57,460 --> 00:14:00,290
I assume this means I have the job.

220
00:13:57,460 --> 00:14:00,290
我想 这代表这份任务 归我了

221
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:11,390
法国 巴黎

222
00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:50,410
(法语) 宝贝

223
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:54,600
(法语) 外面是谁?

224
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:24,630
This will be suitable after a thorough cleanse.

225
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:24,630
彻底清理之后 这里就会变得很舒适了

226
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:29,260
I want you to go to the circus now.

227
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:29,260
我希望你现在就动身去马戏团

228
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:31,550
Give my note to Credence,

229
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:31,550
把我的信带给克雷登斯

230
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,390
begin his journey.

231
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,390
开始他的旅程

232
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:36,770
When we've won, they'll flee cities in the millions.

233
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:36,770
等我们赢了 有成千上万的人会逃走

234
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:38,560
They've had their time.

235
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:38,560
他们得意得够久了

236
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:40,890
We don't say such things out loud.

237
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:40,890
这些事情不需要我们大声说出来

238
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:42,770
We want only freedom.

239
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:42,770
我们只想要自由

240
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,320
Freedom to be ourselves.

241
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,320
可以做自己的自由

242
00:15:45,690 --> 00:15:47,860
To annihilate non-wizards.

243
00:15:45,690 --> 00:15:47,860
还要消灭不会魔法的人

244
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:49,900
Not all of them. Not all.

245
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:49,900
不是他们所有人 不全是

246
00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:52,530
We're not merciless.

247
00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:52,530
我们还不至于那么无情

248
00:15:53,570 --> 00:15:56,660
The beast of burden will always be necessary.

249
00:15:53,570 --> 00:15:56,660
任何时候都需要用来干活的牲畜

250
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:04,600
梅里恩街

251
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:05,850
Ventus.

252
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:05,850
风旋骤卷

253
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:50,110
Dumbledore.

254
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:50,110
邓布利多

255
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:54,900
Were the less conspicuous rooftops full, then?

256
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:54,900
你非得站在这么显眼的屋顶上吗?

257
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,660
I do enjoy a view.

258
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,660
我确实很喜欢欣赏风景

259
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,450
Nebulus.

260
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,450
云雾缥缈

261
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:07,960
How was it?

262
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:07,960
怎么样了

263
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:10,790
They're still convinced that you sent me to New York.

264
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:10,790
他们仍然坚信是你派我去纽约的

265
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,500
You told them I didn't?

266
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,500
你说不是我?

267
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:13,840
Yes.

268
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:13,840
是的

269
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:15,130
Evening.

270
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:15,130
晚安

271
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:16,930
Even though you did.

272
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:16,930
虽然确实是你

273
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:21,470
You told me where to find that trafficked Thunderbird,

274
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:21,470
是你告诉我哪里可以找到那只被交易的雷鸟

275
00:18:21,390 --> 00:18:23,330
Dumbledore. You knew that I would take him home

276
00:18:21,390 --> 00:18:23,330
邓布利多 你清楚我会带他回家

277
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:24,880
and you knew I'd have to take him through a Muggle port.

278
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:24,880
你也知道我只能用麻瓜的交通工具带他走

279
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:27,640
Well, I've always felt an affinity with the great magical birds..

280
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:27,640
嗯 我总觉得我和那些有强大魔力的鸟类有亲切感

281
00:18:27,730 --> 00:18:29,350
There's a story in my family

282
00:18:27,730 --> 00:18:29,350
在我家族中有一个传说

283
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:33,400
that a phoenix will come to any Dumbledore who is in desperate need.

284
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:33,400
邓布利多家族的人有急切需要时 凤凰就会出现

285
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:36,110
They say my great-great grandfather had one, but that it took flight when he died,

286
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:36,110
据说我的曾祖父就有一只 但是自从他去世后

287
00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:40,280
never to return.

288
00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:40,280
凤凰就再也没有出现过

289
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:42,830
With all due respect, I don't believe for a minute

290
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:42,830
恕我冒昧 教授 我绝对不相信

291
00:18:42,910 --> 00:18:45,370
that's why you told me about the Thunderbird.

292
00:18:42,910 --> 00:18:45,370
这就是你告诉我雷鸟的原因

293
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,090
删剪片段

294
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,010
Why did you send me to New York?

295
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,010
你为什么要送我去纽约

296
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:07,730
Because I knew Grindelwald would try to catch Credence.

297
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:07,730
因为我知道格林德沃会试图抓住克雷登斯

298
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:10,310
He had a vision, you see, many years ago

299
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:10,310
你要知道 多年以前 他就预知

300
00:19:10,770 --> 00:19:15,030
In which an Obscurial killed a man he fears above all others

301
00:19:10,770 --> 00:19:15,030
一个默然者杀死了他最害怕的人

302
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,400
You.

303
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,400
就是你

304
00:19:21,530 --> 00:19:24,700
I thought you might deprive Grindelwald of his weapon.

305
00:19:21,530 --> 00:19:24,700
我觉得你能消灭格林德沃的武器

306
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:27,620
Not by killing Credence, but by saving him.

307
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:27,620
不过不是要杀死克雷登斯 而是拯救他

308
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,920
Credence is in Paris, Newt.

309
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,920
克雷登斯在巴黎 纽特

310
00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:37,590
He's trying to trace his real family.

311
00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:37,590
他在寻找到自己真正的家族

312
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:39,050
I take it.

313
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:39,050
这我信

314
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:42,800
You've heard the rumors about who he really is?

315
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:42,800
我估计你已听说 关于他真实身分的传闻

316
00:19:42,970 --> 00:19:43,970
No.

317
00:19:42,970 --> 00:19:43,970
并没有

318
00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:55,650
The pure-bloods think he's the last of an important French line,

319
00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:55,650
纯血家族认为他是法国一个重要家族最后的血脉

320
00:19:57,940 --> 00:20:00,240
a baby whom everyone thought lost

321
00:19:57,940 --> 00:20:00,240
他们认为 他在婴儿时期就失踪了

322
00:20:00,530 --> 00:20:03,070
- Not Leta's brother? - That's what they're whispering.

323
00:20:00,530 --> 00:20:03,070
-那不是指莉塔的弟弟吧? -大家是这么想的

324
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:06,830
Pure-blood or not, I know this...

325
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:06,830
无论是不是纯血 我知道

326
00:20:07,490 --> 00:20:10,160
An Obscurus grows in the absence of love

327
00:20:07,490 --> 00:20:10,160
默默然是因为缺少关爱而产生的

328
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:12,920
as a dark twin, an only friend.

329
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:12,920
只能终日与黑暗为伴

330
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,880
If Credence has a real brother or sister out there that can take its place,

331
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,880
如果克雷登斯真的有亲生的兄弟姐妹能够代替默默然

332
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:19,170
he might yet be saved.

333
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:19,170
他也许还有救

334
00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:22,720
Wherever Credence is in Paris, he's either in danger

335
00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:22,720
不论他在巴黎的何处 若不是身处险境

336
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,720
or a danger to others.

337
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,720
就是会危害他人

338
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:28,180
We may not know who he is yet, but he needs to be found.

339
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:28,180
我们仍然不知道他到底是谁 但是我们必须找到他

340
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:32,560
And I rather hoped you might be the one to find him.

341
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:32,560
我希望你能找到他

342
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:39,110
What's that?

343
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:39,110
这是什么

344
00:20:39,690 --> 00:20:43,410
An address of a very old acquaintance of mine.

345
00:20:39,690 --> 00:20:43,410
这是我一个老熟人的地址

346
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:47,780
A safe house in Paris, reinforced with enchantments.

347
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:47,780
这是巴黎的一处安全屋 用魔法进行保护

348
00:20:47,870 --> 00:20:50,200
Safe house? Why would I need a safe house in Paris?

349
00:20:47,870 --> 00:20:50,200
安全屋 我为什么需要在巴黎用安全屋

350
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:53,960
One hopes you won't, but should things at some point go terribly wrong

351
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:53,960
我也希望你用不上 但是凡事总会有意外

352
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:55,460
it's good to have a place to go.

353
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:55,460
有地方去总是件好事

354
00:20:55,830 --> 00:20:58,130
You know, for a cup of tea.

355
00:20:55,830 --> 00:20:58,130
至少能喝杯茶 你懂的

356
00:20:58,210 --> 00:21:00,960
No, no, no, absolutely not.

357
00:20:58,210 --> 00:21:00,960
不 不 不 绝对不行

358
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:03,720
I'm banned from international travel, Dumbledore.

359
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:03,720
我被禁止出境旅行 邓布利多

360
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:06,800
If I leave the country, they will put me in Azkaban and throw away the key.

361
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:06,800
如果我离开英国 他们就会把我丢进阿兹卡班 然后把钥匙丢了

362
00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:09,310
Do you know why I admire you, Newt? -Why?

363
00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:09,310
你知道为什么我如此喜欢你吗 纽特? -为什么?

364
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:12,520
More, perhaps, than any man I know?

365
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:12,520
认识的人里我最喜欢你

366
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:16,690
You don't seek power

367
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:16,690
你不渴望权利

368
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:18,860
or popularity.

369
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:18,860
或者名气

370
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:24,110
You simply ask, is the thing right in itself?

371
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:24,110
你在乎的 是事物的本身是否正确

372
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:28,160
If it is, you do it, no matter the cost.

373
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:28,160
如果是 你会为此不计一切代价

374
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:30,200
That's all very well, Dumbledore

375
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:30,200
好吧差不多是这样 邓布利多

376
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:32,750
but, forgive me for asking, why can't you go?

377
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:32,750
但是请原谅 我想问 为什么你不去?

378
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:40,460
I cannot move against Grindelwald.

379
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:40,460
我不能对抗格林德沃

380
00:21:44,010 --> 00:21:45,430
It has to be you.

381
00:21:44,010 --> 00:21:45,430
只能是你

382
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:53,600
Well, I can't blame you,

383
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:53,600
好吧 我不怪你

384
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:56,350
in your shoes I'd probably refuse too.

385
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:56,350
如果我是你 我也很可能会拒绝

386
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:58,810
- What...? - It's late. Good evening, Newt

387
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:58,810
-什么... -不早了 晚安 纽特

388
00:21:58,980 --> 00:21:59,980
Wait. No!

389
00:21:58,980 --> 00:21:59,980
等等 不

390
00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:02,610
Oh, come on.

391
00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:02,610
哦 不会吧

392
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,380
Dumbledore.

393
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,380
邓布利多

394
00:23:23,690 --> 00:23:25,070
Bunty!

395
00:23:23,690 --> 00:23:25,070
邦缇

396
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:28,360
Bunty!

397
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:28,360
邦缇

398
00:23:31,570 --> 00:23:34,870
Bunty, the baby Nifflers are loose again!

399
00:23:31,570 --> 00:23:34,870
邦缇 嗅嗅宝宝又跑出来了

400
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,050
Well done

401
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,050
好样的

402
00:23:48,130 --> 00:23:48,880
I'm so sorry, Newt.

403
00:23:48,130 --> 00:23:48,880
我很抱歉 纽特

404
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,880
They must have picked the lock while I was cleaning out the Augureys

405
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,880
他们肯定是趁我清理卜鸟的时候溜了

406
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:52,050
Not to worry.

407
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:52,050
没关系

408
00:23:58,730 --> 00:24:01,900
I've fed nearly everyone, Pinky's had his nose drops, and

409
00:23:58,730 --> 00:24:01,900
差不多都喂了 给平奇滴了鼻液 然后

410
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:02,900
And Elsie?

411
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:02,900
艾尔西呢

412
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:04,610
Elsie's droppings are nearly normal again.

413
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:04,610
艾尔西的粪便也快要正常了

414
00:24:04,690 --> 00:24:05,690
Wonderful.

415
00:24:04,690 --> 00:24:05,690
非常好

416
00:24:06,610 --> 00:24:09,530
You can clock off now...

417
00:24:06,610 --> 00:24:09,530
你现在可以下班了...

418
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:15,240
- I told you to leave the Kelpie to me. - That wound needs more ointment.

419
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:15,240
-我跟你说过把马形水怪交给我 -伤口还需要擦药膏

420
00:24:15,330 --> 00:24:16,990
I don't want you losing fingers over it.

421
00:24:15,330 --> 00:24:16,990
我不想你失去你的手指

422
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:29,670
Seriously, you go home now, Bunty.

423
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:29,670
说真的 快回去吧 邦缇

424
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:32,380
You must be exhausted.

425
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:32,380
你肯定累坏了

426
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:34,550
You know the Kelpie's easier with two.

427
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:34,550
两个人一起对付马形水怪会更容易

428
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:41,230
Perhaps you should take off your shirt?

429
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:41,230
要不要把衬衫脱了?

430
00:24:43,230 --> 00:24:44,730
Don't worry,

431
00:24:43,230 --> 00:24:44,730
别担心

432
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:46,770
I'll dry off quickly enough.

433
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:46,770
我马上就能弄干

434
00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:31,990
Someone needed to let off some steam. Ointment, Bunty?

435
00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:31,990
看起来有人需要宣泄一下感情 药膏 邦缇

436
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:41,490
You bite Bunty again and there'll be trouble, mister.

437
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:41,490
你再敢咬邦缇 我就要给你点颜色看看了 先生

438
00:25:44,410 --> 00:25:45,620
What was that?

439
00:25:44,410 --> 00:25:45,620
什么声音?

440
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:47,540
I don't know.

441
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:47,540
我不知道

442
00:25:49,790 --> 00:25:51,590
But I want you to go home now, Bunty.

443
00:25:49,790 --> 00:25:51,590
但是我想你真的该回家了 邦缇

444
00:25:51,670 --> 00:25:53,050
Shall I call the Ministry?

445
00:25:51,670 --> 00:25:53,050
需要我叫魔法部吗?

446
00:25:53,130 --> 00:25:55,090
No, I want you to go home. Please.

447
00:25:53,130 --> 00:25:55,090
不 我需要你回家 请回吧

448
00:26:03,850 --> 00:26:05,810
If you could just give it to me...

449
00:26:03,850 --> 00:26:05,810
如果可以 请把东西给我

450
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:07,520
Honey, if you could just give it to me.

451
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:07,520
亲爱的 麻烦把它给我

452
00:26:07,690 --> 00:26:09,150
- He doesn't care. Hold it.

453
00:26:07,690 --> 00:26:09,150
-他不会介意的 拿着

454
00:26:09,230 --> 00:26:11,440
If you could just give it to me.

455
00:26:09,230 --> 00:26:11,440
那就把它给我吧

456
00:26:17,030 --> 00:26:18,570
Hey...

457
00:26:17,030 --> 00:26:18,570
嘿...

458
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:22,790
NEWT! Get over here, you maniac.

459
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:22,790
纽特！到这里来 你这个小疯子

460
00:26:23,410 --> 00:26:25,870
We hope you don't mind, Newt? We let ourselves in...

461
00:26:23,410 --> 00:26:25,870
我们希望你不会介意 纽特 我们擅自进来了...

462
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:28,580
it's raining out there-cats and dogs!

463
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:28,580
外面在下雨 倾盆大雨

464
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,090
London's cold!

465
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,090
伦敦真冷

466
00:26:30,250 --> 00:26:32,090
But you were supposed to have been Obliviated!

467
00:26:30,250 --> 00:26:32,090
但是你不是应该一忘皆空了吗！

468
00:26:32,170 --> 00:26:35,220
I know! It didn't work, pal.

469
00:26:32,170 --> 00:26:35,220
我知道 但这没用 伙计

470
00:26:35,550 --> 00:26:38,470
I mean, you said it, the potion only erases bad memories.

471
00:26:35,550 --> 00:26:38,470
我是说 你说过 那个毒液只会消除不好的记忆

472
00:26:38,550 --> 00:26:39,970
I didn't have any.

473
00:26:38,550 --> 00:26:39,970
我压根儿没有

474
00:26:40,050 --> 00:26:44,350
I mean, don't get me wrong, I had some weird ones...

475
00:26:40,050 --> 00:26:44,350
别误会 我是有一些奇怪的记忆

476
00:26:44,430 --> 00:26:45,640
but this angel...

477
00:26:44,430 --> 00:26:45,640
但是这个天使...

478
00:26:45,930 --> 00:26:50,270
this angel over here, she filled me in on all the bad parts.

479
00:26:45,930 --> 00:26:50,270
这位天使把我遗忘的部分又重新告诉我了

480
00:26:50,610 --> 00:26:52,520
And here we are, I guess, huh?

481
00:26:50,610 --> 00:26:52,520
所以我们现在在这里了

482
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,940
This is wonderful!

483
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,940
这太棒了

484
00:26:58,030 --> 00:26:58,990
Wait… is it…

485
00:26:58,030 --> 00:26:58,990
等等 那是…

486
00:27:00,370 --> 00:27:03,120
Tina? Tina?

487
00:27:00,370 --> 00:27:03,120
蒂娜 蒂娜

488
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:07,370
Oh it's just us, honey.

489
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:07,370
哦 亲爱的 这里只有我们

490
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:10,080

我和雅各布

492
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:13,500
Why don't I make us some dinner, huh?

493
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:13,500
你不介意我给大家做晚餐吧 嗯?

494
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:14,500
Yes!

495
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:14,500
好棒！

496
00:27:19,590 --> 00:27:20,590
Hey, hon

497
00:27:19,590 --> 00:27:20,590
嗨，甜心

498
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:22,430
Tina and I aren't talking.

499
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:22,430
蒂娜和我都不怎么说话了

500
00:27:23,430 --> 00:27:24,510
Why?

501
00:27:23,430 --> 00:27:24,510
为什么？

502
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:28,310
Oh well, you know, she found out about Jacob and

503
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:28,310
嗯...你知道 她发现了我和雅各布

504
00:27:28,390 --> 00:27:30,980
I seeing each other and she didn't like it,

505
00:27:28,390 --> 00:27:30,980
一直在见面 她不喜欢我们这样

506
00:27:31,190 --> 00:27:32,520
cause of the “law.”

507
00:27:31,190 --> 00:27:32,520
因为“法律”

508
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:35,110
Not allowed oops, not allowed to date No-Majs,

509
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:35,110
不许...不许和麻鸡约会

510
00:27:35,190 --> 00:27:38,030
not allowed to marry them blah, blah, blah.

511
00:27:35,190 --> 00:27:38,030
不许和他们结婚 没完没了

512
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:42,370
Well, she was all in a tizzy anyway, 'cause of you.

513
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:42,370
并且 因为你 她总是很容易感到烦躁

514
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:43,580
Me?

515
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:43,580
我？

516
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:45,120

517
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:45,120

00:27:47,410 --> 00:27:49,580
在这 我替你带来了

522
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:56,670

00:27:57,510 --> 00:28:00,010
Brother Thesus and unknown woman

525
00:27:57,510 --> 00:28:00,010
哥哥忒修斯的伴侣未知

526
00:28:00,550 --> 00:28:03,300
No. So Thesus is marrying Leta, not me.

527
00:28:00,550 --> 00:28:03,300
不 要娶莉塔的是忒修斯不是我

528
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:08,180
Oh. Oh dear.

529
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:08,180
哦天啊

530
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,690
Well,

531
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,690
但是

532
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:16,230
So Tina read that, and she started dating someone else

533
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:16,230
蒂娜看到消息后 就开始跟别人约会了

534
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:19,740
He’s an auror. His name is Achilles Tolliver

536
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:21,320

537
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:21,320
托利佛

538
00:28:27,490 --> 00:28:30,960
ANYWAY, we are really excited to be here Newt.

539
00:28:27,490 --> 00:28:30,960
总之 我们来这里真的很高兴 纽特

540
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:34,250
This is a special trip for us.

541
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:34,250
这次旅行对我们来说很特别

542
00:28:34,670 --> 00:28:37,130
You see, Jacob and I

543
00:28:34,670 --> 00:28:37,130
雅各布和我

544
00:28:38,210 --> 00:28:39,920
We’re getting married!

545
00:28:38,210 --> 00:28:39,920

546
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:44,720

547
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:44,720
和雅各布结婚

548
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:54,190
You've enchanted him, haven't you?

549
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:54,190
你对他施法了是吗

550
00:28:55,310 --> 00:28:56,520
What?

551
00:28:55,310 --> 00:28:56,520
什么

552
00:28:57,610 --> 00:28:59,320
I have not.

553
00:28:57,610 --> 00:28:59,320
我没有

554
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:01,110
Will you stop reading my mind?

555
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:01,110
你能不能别读我心

556
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:03,990
Queenie, you've brought him here against his will.

557
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:03,990
奎妮 你违背他的意愿带他来这里的

558
00:29:04,070 --> 00:29:07,120
Oh, that is an outrageous accusation. Look at him.

559
00:29:04,070 --> 00:29:07,120
噢 你怎么能这么说 看看他

560
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,950
He's just happy.

561
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,950
他现在特别开心

562
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:11,960
Then you won't mind if I...

563
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:11,960
那你不会介意我

564
00:29:14,170 --> 00:29:15,380
Please don't!

565
00:29:14,170 --> 00:29:15,380
千万别

566
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:17,670
Queenie, you've got nothing to fear if he wants to get married.

567
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:17,670
奎妮 如果他想结婚的话你没什么好怕的

568
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:21,300
We can just lift the enchantment... and he can tell us himself.

569
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:21,300
我们可以让他恢复正常 然后自己告诉我们

570
00:29:30,930 --> 00:29:32,060
What you got there?

571
00:29:30,930 --> 00:29:32,060
你那是什么

572
00:29:32,730 --> 00:29:35,730
Whatchu gonna do? Whatchu gonna do with that, Mr. Scamander?

573
00:29:32,730 --> 00:29:35,730
你要干什么 你要用它干什么 斯卡曼德先生

574
00:29:36,230 --> 00:29:37,310
Surgito.

575
00:29:36,230 --> 00:29:37,310
咒术解除

576
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:50,370
Congratulations on your engagement, Jacob.

577
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:50,370
雅各布 恭喜你的订婚

578
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:52,200
Wait, what?

579
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:52,200
等等 什么

580
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:57,790
Oh no, you didn't.

581
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:57,790
哦不 你没有

582
00:30:00,670 --> 00:30:03,210

00:30:00,670 --> 00:30:03,210
奎儿 等下

584
00:30:04,090 --> 00:30:05,340
Queenie!

585
00:30:04,090 --> 00:30:05,340
奎妮

586
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:07,840
It's very nice to see you.

587
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:07,840
很高兴见到你

588
00:30:07,930 --> 00:30:09,180
Where the hell am I right now?

589
00:30:07,930 --> 00:30:09,180
我现在到底在哪里

590
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:10,180
Uh, uh, London.

591
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:10,180
额 伦敦

592
00:30:11,890 --> 00:30:13,680
Oh! I always wanted to go here!

593
00:30:11,890 --> 00:30:13,680
噢 我一直想来的

594
00:30:14,350 --> 00:30:15,230
Queenie!

595
00:30:14,350 --> 00:30:15,230
奎妮

596
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:20,650
Oh Queenie, honey.

597
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:20,650
噢 奎妮 亲爱的

598
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:25,070
Well, I'm just curious, when were you going to wake me up? After we'd had five kids?

599
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:25,070
等等 我只是想问一下 你准备什么时候让我恢复正常 当我们有了五个孩子以后吗

600
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:30,120
- Why is it wrong to want to marry you? - Okay.

601
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:30,120
-我想嫁给你有错吗 –好吧

602
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:32,700
To wanna have a family?

603
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:32,700
想要个家庭有错吗

604
00:30:33,410 --> 00:30:36,000
I just want what everyone else has, that's all.

605
00:30:33,410 --> 00:30:36,000
我只想拥有其他人有的东西 就这些

606
00:30:38,210 --> 00:30:41,960
Okay, wait.. We talked about this, like, a million times.

607
00:30:38,210 --> 00:30:41,960
好的 等等 我们都讨论过这个 快几百万次了

608
00:30:42,130 --> 00:30:45,130
If we get married and they find out, they're gonna throw you in jail, sweetheart.

609
00:30:42,130 --> 00:30:45,130
如果他们发现我们两个结婚的话 他们会把你扔进监狱的 亲爱的

610
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:46,920
I can't have that.

611
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:46,920
我不能让这发生

612
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:50,510
They don't like people like me marrying people like you.

613
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:50,510
他们不喜欢像我这样的人和像你这样的人通婚

614
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:53,810
I ain't a wizard. I'm just me.

615
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:53,810
我不是个巫师 只是个普通人

616
00:30:53,970 --> 00:30:57,980
They're really progressive here, and they'll let us get married properly.

617
00:30:53,970 --> 00:30:57,980
他们这边很包容 我们可以光明正大结婚的

618
00:30:58,060 --> 00:31:00,480
Sweetheart, you don't need to enchant me.

619
00:30:58,060 --> 00:31:00,480
亲爱的 你不需要对我施法

620
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:03,070
I'm already enchanted!

621
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:03,070
我早已为你着迷

622
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:05,610
I love you so much.

623
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:05,610
我太爱你了

624
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:07,400
- Yeah?? - Yeah.

625
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:07,400
-真的吗 -真的

626
00:31:08,570 --> 00:31:11,200
But I can't have you risking everything like this, you know?

627
00:31:08,570 --> 00:31:11,200
但我不能让你这样冒险 你知道吗

628
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:13,830
You're not giving us a choice, sweetheart.

629
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:13,830
你不给我任何选择 亲爱的

630
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,960
You're not givin' me a choice.

631
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,960
你也没有给我一个选择

632
00:31:18,410 --> 00:31:21,540
One of us had to be brave, and you were being a coward!

633
00:31:18,410 --> 00:31:21,540
我们两个必须有一个人需要勇敢起来 然后你还是个懦夫

634
00:31:23,670 --> 00:31:25,340
I was being a coward?

635
00:31:23,670 --> 00:31:25,340
我是个懦夫

636
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:27,510
If I'm a coward, you're...

637
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:27,510
如果我是个懦夫 你就是个

638
00:31:29,930 --> 00:31:30,930
Crazy

639
00:31:29,930 --> 00:31:30,930
疯子

640
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:33,760
I didn't say it...

641
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:33,760
我没这么说

642
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:36,520
- You didn't have to. - No, I didn't mean it, sweetheart.

643
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:36,520
-你不需要说出口 -我不是那个意思 亲爱的

644
00:31:37,890 --> 00:31:39,140
Yeah, you did.

645
00:31:37,890 --> 00:31:39,140
不 你就是那个意思

646
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:43,150
I'm gonna go see my sister.

647
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:43,150
我要去见我姐姐

648
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:45,570
Fine. See your sister. - Fine.

649
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:45,570
好 去见你姐姐去吧 - 好

650
00:31:45,650 --> 00:31:47,190
No! Wait!

651
00:31:45,650 --> 00:31:47,190
不，等等

652
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:49,280
Queenie! No! Queenie!

653
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:49,280
不，奎妮

654
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:53,030
I didn't mean it.

655
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:53,030
我不是这个意思

656
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,040
I didn't say nothing.

657
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,040
我什么也没说

658
00:32:10,510 --> 00:32:12,010
恢复如初

659
00:32:10,510 --> 00:32:12,010
Papyrus Reparo

660
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:17,470
PARIS

661
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:17,470
巴黎

662
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:25,520
My dear Queenie, what a beautiful city.

663
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:25,520
我亲爱的奎妮 这可真是个美丽的城市

664
00:32:25,690 --> 00:32:28,110
I'm thinking of you. Tina.

665
00:32:25,690 --> 00:32:28,110
我在想你 蒂娜

666
00:32:34,490 --> 00:32:35,830
Hey, Newt?

667
00:32:34,490 --> 00:32:35,830
嘿 纽特

668
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:39,120
Down here, Jacob. I'll be with you in a second.

669
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:39,120
在下面 雅各布 我马上过去

670
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:45,330
I got my own problems.

671
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:45,330
我自己的麻烦就不少了

672
00:32:52,050 --> 00:32:54,260
BUNTY! DON'T FORGET TO GIVE PATRICK PELLETS.

673
00:32:52,050 --> 00:32:54,260
邦缇 别忘了给帕特里克喂药

674
00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:03,310
Tina Goldstein pointed as auror

675
00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:03,310
（蒂娜·戈德斯坦恩成为傲罗）

676
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:11,780
Queenie left a postcard.

677
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:11,780
奎妮留下一张明信片

678
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:13,820
Tina's in Paris looking for Credence.

679
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:13,820
蒂娜在巴黎找克雷登斯

680
00:33:13,910 --> 00:33:14,910
Genius!

681
00:33:13,910 --> 00:33:14,910
太棒了

682
00:33:15,110 --> 00:33:17,160
Queenie's gonna go straight for Tina.

683
00:33:15,110 --> 00:33:17,160
奎妮会直接去找蒂娜的

684
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:18,990
Okay, we're going to France, pal!

685
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:18,990
好的 我们要去法国了 兄弟

686
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:21,080
- Hold on. I'll get my jacket. - I've got it

687
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:21,080
- 等下 我去拿我的夹克 - 我拿好了

688
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:30,840
Oh. Beautiful.

689
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:30,840
棒极了

690
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:33,130
删剪片段

691
00:33:37,470 --> 00:33:38,600
Come on

692
00:33:37,470 --> 00:33:38,600
来吧

693
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:41,060
I don't think it's reasonable to ask Bunty to cope with everyone here

694
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:41,060
我觉得叫邦缇应付这些生物和一堆新生儿

695
00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:42,810
and a bunch of newborns, so...

696
00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:42,810
不太合理，所以…

697
00:33:42,890 --> 00:33:44,310
Are you insane?

698
00:33:42,890 --> 00:33:44,310
你疯了吗?

699
00:33:45,350 --> 00:33:47,100
You're gonna pack the nifflers now?

700
00:33:45,350 --> 00:33:47,100
你现在要打包嗅嗅了吗?

701
00:33:48,150 --> 00:33:50,070
- In you hop. - Remember what happened last time?

702
00:33:48,150 --> 00:33:50,070
-进去吧 -记得上次发生什么事吗?

703
00:33:50,150 --> 00:33:51,780
We fixed the lock.

704
00:33:50,150 --> 00:33:51,780
我们把锁修好了

705
00:33:52,190 --> 00:33:54,070
So nothing gets out without my say-so

706
00:33:52,190 --> 00:33:54,070
现在没我允许什么都跑不出来

707
00:33:56,030 --> 00:33:57,070
Come on.

708
00:33:56,030 --> 00:33:57,070
快来吧

709
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:00,870
Get a move on.

710
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:00,870
快点啦

711
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:08,830
All right then. Accio necklace

712
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:08,830
行吧 项链飞来

713
00:34:16,590 --> 00:34:19,510
Now you set a good example

714
00:34:16,590 --> 00:34:19,510
现在你做个好榜样

715
00:34:22,890 --> 00:34:26,640
BUNTY, GONE TO PARIS. HAVE TAKEN NIFFLERS WITH ME. NEWT.

716
00:34:22,890 --> 00:34:26,640
（邦缇 我带了嗅嗅去巴黎 --纽特）

717
00:35:39,630 --> 00:35:40,930
Nagini.

718
00:35:39,630 --> 00:35:40,930
纳吉尼

719
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:47,890
Credence.

720
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:47,890
克雷登斯

721
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:53,310
I think I know where she is.

722
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:53,310
我想我知道她在哪里

723
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:00,820
We escape tonight.

724
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:00,820
我们今晚逃走

725
00:36:00,910 --> 00:36:01,910
Hey.

726
00:36:00,910 --> 00:36:01,910
嘿

727
00:36:07,790 --> 00:36:10,290
I've told you to stay away from her, boy.

728
00:36:07,790 --> 00:36:10,290
我跟你说过离她远点

729
00:36:10,870 --> 00:36:12,750
Did I say you could take a break?

730
00:36:10,870 --> 00:36:12,750
我说过你可以休息了吗

731
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,250
Clean out the Kappa.

732
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,250
去给河童洗澡

733
00:36:17,210 --> 00:36:18,920
And you, get ready!

734
00:36:17,210 --> 00:36:18,920
你 去做准备

735
00:36:31,390 --> 00:36:35,520
Next in our little show of freaks and oddities...

736
00:36:31,390 --> 00:36:35,520
接下来 我们这个精奇古怪的表演里

737
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:38,230
I present to you...

738
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:38,230
我要呈现给各位的

739
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:40,400
a Maledictus!

740
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:40,400
是一个血咒宿主

741
00:36:43,950 --> 00:36:46,660
Once trapped in the jungles of Indonesia,

742
00:36:43,950 --> 00:36:46,660
它曾经被困在印度尼西亚的森林里

743
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:50,450
she is the carrier of a blood curse.

744
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:50,450
身上背负着血咒

745
00:36:51,910 --> 00:36:56,210
Such Under-beings are destined, through the course of their lives...

746
00:36:51,910 --> 00:36:56,210
像她这样的生物 一生的宿命

747
00:36:56,670 --> 00:36:59,380
to turn permanently into beasts.

748
00:36:56,670 --> 00:36:59,380
注定是会永远转变成野兽的

749
00:37:02,550 --> 00:37:03,880
But look at her.

750
00:37:02,550 --> 00:37:03,880
看看她

751
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:07,260
So beautiful, yes?

752
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:07,260
多么漂亮 是不是

753
00:37:08,890 --> 00:37:10,850
So desirable.

754
00:37:08,890 --> 00:37:10,850
如此诱人

755
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:15,770
But soon she will be trapped forever in a very different body.

756
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:15,770
但是很快 她会永远被困在一副截然不同的躯体里了

757
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:21,240
Every night, when she sleeps, mesdames et messieurs...

758
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:21,240
每晚当她沉睡时，女士们和先生们

759
00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:25,820
She is forced to become...

760
00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:25,820
她都会变成...

761
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:35,210
She is forced to become...

762
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:35,210
她都会变成...

763
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:43,090
She is forced to become...

764
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:43,090
她都会变成...

765
00:37:52,350 --> 00:37:55,980
Over time, she will not be able to transform back.

766
00:37:52,350 --> 00:37:55,980
久而久之 她就再也变不回来了

767
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:02,400
She will be forever trapped in the body of a snake.

768
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:02,400
她会永远被困在蛇的躯体之中

769
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:37,020
Credence!

770
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:37,020
克雷登斯

771
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:49,870
Pack it up! Paris is done for us now.

772
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:49,870
收拾东西走人 巴黎容不下我们了

773
00:39:19,730 --> 00:39:22,570
The boy with the Maledictus, what do you know about him?

774
00:39:19,730 --> 00:39:22,570
关于和血咒宿主一起的男孩 你都了解些什么

775
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:27,700
He's looking for his mother.

776
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:27,700
他在找他的妈妈

777
00:39:27,860 --> 00:39:30,530
All my freaks think they can go home.

778
00:39:27,860 --> 00:39:30,530
我马戏团里所有的怪胎们觉得他们能回家

779
00:39:33,450 --> 00:39:34,830
Okay, let's go.

780
00:39:33,450 --> 00:39:34,830
好 走了

781
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:55,100
Look, I think we were both at the circus for the same reason, monsieur ...?

782
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:55,100
你看 我觉得我们是因为同一个原因来到马戏团的 先生

783
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,600
Kama. Yusuf Kama.

784
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,600
我是卡玛 尤瑟夫·卡玛

785
00:39:58,890 --> 00:40:00,140
And you think right.

786
00:39:58,890 --> 00:40:00,140
你想得没错

787
00:40:00,230 --> 00:40:02,230
- What do you want with Credence? - The same as you.

788
00:40:00,230 --> 00:40:02,230
-你想找克雷登斯干什么 -跟你一样的目的

789
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:03,440
Which is?

790
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:03,440
说说看

791
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:05,270
To prove who the boy really is.

792
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:05,270
证明他的真实身份

793
00:40:09,190 --> 00:40:11,240
If the rumors of his identity are correct, he and I are

794
00:40:09,190 --> 00:40:11,240
如果关于他身份的传言属实 那我们算是

795
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:14,910
distantly related.

796
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:14,910
远亲

797
00:40:16,620 --> 00:40:18,700
I am the last male of my pure-blooded line.

798
00:40:16,620 --> 00:40:18,700
我是我们纯血家族里的最后一名男丁

799
00:40:18,790 --> 00:40:21,000
And so, if the rumors are correct, is he

800
00:40:18,790 --> 00:40:21,000
若传闻属实 他也是我的族人

801
00:40:23,130 --> 00:40:26,920
Have you read The Predictions of Tycho Dodonus?

802
00:40:23,130 --> 00:40:26,920
你读过泰克 多多纳斯的预言录吗

803
00:40:27,590 --> 00:40:30,930
Yeah. But that's poetry, not proof.

804
00:40:27,590 --> 00:40:30,930
读过 但那只是诗 不能作为证据

805
00:40:34,350 --> 00:40:36,260
If I could show you something better

806
00:40:34,350 --> 00:40:36,260
我可以给你看看更充分

807
00:40:37,890 --> 00:40:41,140
more concrete, something that proves who he is

808
00:40:37,890 --> 00:40:41,140
更有说服力的证据 一些能证实他身份的东西

809
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:44,860
would the Ministries of Europe and America let him live?

810
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:44,860
欧洲和美国的魔法部会让他活下来吗

811
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:48,030
They might.

812
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:48,030
可能会

813
00:40:49,940 --> 00:40:51,150
Then come.

814
00:40:49,940 --> 00:40:51,150
那就跟我来吧

815
00:40:55,660 --> 00:40:57,660
删剪片段

816
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:02,620
Oh no, Yaxley

817
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:02,620
又来了 亚克斯利

818
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:05,330
I hate the way he makes a beeline for me every time.

819
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:05,330
我讨厌他每次都这样直勾勾地盯着我

820
00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:08,460
Not if you insist on being the most beautiful woman in the room.

821
00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:08,460
没办法 谁让你一直都是屋子里最美的女人呢

822
00:41:08,550 --> 00:41:10,840
It's not that and you know it.

823
00:41:08,550 --> 00:41:10,840
你知道他不是这样想的

824
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:13,050
It's all blood with Yaxley.

825
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:13,050
亚克斯利的双手沾满了鲜血

826
00:41:13,130 --> 00:41:15,930
Let me go and congratulate him and we can dance.

827
00:41:13,130 --> 00:41:15,930
那我去祝贺他一下 我们就可以跳舞了

828
00:41:16,010 --> 00:41:19,470
And then I promise I won't say a word to anyone for the rest of the night

829
00:41:16,010 --> 00:41:19,470
而我保证在这以后今晚都不会跟任何人说一句话

830
00:41:20,470 --> 00:41:22,600
- You promise? - Promise.

831
00:41:20,470 --> 00:41:22,600
-你保证? -我保证

832
00:41:26,230 --> 00:41:27,400
Sorry

833
00:41:26,230 --> 00:41:27,400
抱歉

834
00:41:32,030 --> 00:41:34,280
- How have you been? - You sly dog

835
00:41:32,030 --> 00:41:34,280
-你最近怎么样 -你这只老狐狸

836
00:41:42,620 --> 00:41:43,750
Is that her?

837
00:41:42,620 --> 00:41:43,750
是她吗？

838
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:45,290
It is, look.

839
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:45,290
是的 你看

840
00:41:49,670 --> 00:41:50,960
Her brother's alive

841
00:41:49,670 --> 00:41:50,960
她弟弟还活着

842
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:54,300
The prediction is true

843
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:54,300
预言是真的

844
00:41:56,260 --> 00:41:58,430
Her brother would lead us from the shadows

845
00:41:56,260 --> 00:41:58,430
她弟弟会带领我们走出阴霾

846
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:21,410
”Return, great avenger, with wings from the water“

847
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:21,410
"回来吧 伟大的复仇者 带着水中之翼"

848
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,660
Congratulations, Leta

849
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,660
莉塔 恭喜你

850
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:26,620
Your brother lives

851
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:26,620
你弟弟活下来了

852
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,710
We all truly believe it

853
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,710
我们都十分相信这一点

854
00:43:28,350 --> 00:43:29,350
So,

855
00:43:28,350 --> 00:43:29,350
所以

856
00:43:33,110 --> 00:43:34,940
Credence Barebone

857
00:43:33,110 --> 00:43:34,940
克雷登斯 拜尔本

858
00:43:37,110 --> 00:43:40,320
Nearly destroyed by the woman who raised him.

859
00:43:37,110 --> 00:43:40,320
差点被他的养母毁掉

860
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:43,780
Yet now he seeks the mother who bore him.

861
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:43,780
但现在他在寻找他的生母

862
00:43:44,830 --> 00:43:46,660
He's desperate for family.

863
00:43:44,830 --> 00:43:46,660
他渴望家庭

864
00:43:47,620 --> 00:43:49,370
He's desperate for love.

865
00:43:47,620 --> 00:43:49,370
他渴望被爱

866
00:43:50,830 --> 00:43:53,500
He's the key to our victory.

867
00:43:50,830 --> 00:43:53,500
他是我们成功的关键

868
00:43:54,420 --> 00:43:56,090
Well, we know where the boy is, don't we?

869
00:43:54,420 --> 00:43:56,090
我们知道那个男孩在哪 不是吗

870
00:43:57,670 --> 00:43:59,340
Why don't we grab him and leave!

871
00:43:57,670 --> 00:43:59,340
为什么我们不抓了他就走

872
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:02,850
He must come to me freely，and he will.

873
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:02,850
他必须自愿来找我 而他也会这么做

874
00:44:04,470 --> 00:44:08,020
The path has been laid, and he is following it.

875
00:44:04,470 --> 00:44:08,020
路已经铺好了 他正在顺着它前进

876
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:12,600
The trail that will lead him to me,

877
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:12,600
这条路会把他带向我的身边

878
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:17,190
and the strange and glorious truth of who he is.

879
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:17,190
也会向他揭示他古怪而又光荣的身世

880
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:18,990
Why is he so important?

881
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:18,990
为什么他如此重要

882
00:44:26,290 --> 00:44:30,620
Who represents the greatest threat to our cause?

883
00:44:26,290 --> 00:44:30,620
谁代表着我们事业最大的威胁

884
00:44:31,670 --> 00:44:33,250
Albus Dumbledore.

885
00:44:31,670 --> 00:44:33,250
阿不思·邓布利多

886
00:44:33,750 --> 00:44:39,630
If I asked you now to go to the school... where he is

887
00:44:33,750 --> 00:44:39,630
如果我让你现在去学校 把他从藏身之处揪出来

888
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:41,550
hiding and kill him for me, would you do it for me, Krall?

889
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:41,550
替我杀了他 你愿意吗 克拉尔

890
00:44:47,890 --> 00:44:50,310
Credence is the only entity alive...

891
00:44:47,890 --> 00:44:50,310
克雷登斯是这世上唯一

892
00:44:52,020 --> 00:44:53,600
who can kill him.

893
00:44:52,020 --> 00:44:53,600
能杀死他的人

894
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:57,230
You really think that he can kill the great...

895
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:57,230
你真的认为他可以杀了伟大的...

896
00:44:59,990 --> 00:45:01,950
can kill Albus Dumbledore?

897
00:44:59,990 --> 00:45:01,950
可以杀了阿不思·邓布利多吗

898
00:45:02,780 --> 00:45:04,910
I know he can.

899
00:45:02,780 --> 00:45:04,910
我知道他可以

900
00:45:05,490 --> 00:45:09,450
But will you be with us when that happens, Krall?

901
00:45:05,490 --> 00:45:09,450
但克拉尔 当这一切发生时 你还会和我们站在一起吗

902
00:45:12,620 --> 00:45:13,830
Will you?

903
00:45:12,620 --> 00:45:13,830
会吗

904
00:45:23,260 --> 00:45:25,260
删剪片段

905
00:46:05,260 --> 00:46:06,640
What if she doesn't want me?

906
00:46:05,260 --> 00:46:06,640
万一她不想要我呢

907
00:46:16,140 --> 00:46:17,480
Make it happen.

908
00:46:16,140 --> 00:46:17,480
好好照顾她吧

909
00:46:19,270 --> 00:46:20,360
What?

910
00:46:19,270 --> 00:46:20,360
什么

911
00:46:22,070 --> 00:46:24,820
Because we are free.

912
00:46:22,070 --> 00:46:24,820
因为我们自由了

913
00:47:46,360 --> 00:47:48,280
Jacob, that man Tina's been seeing...

914
00:47:46,360 --> 00:47:48,280
雅各布 那个蒂娜一直在约会的男人

915
00:47:48,450 --> 00:47:51,860
Don't worry, she's gonna see you. And she'll see the four of us together

916
00:47:48,450 --> 00:47:51,860
别担心 等她见到你 就会想起我们四个人一起的时光

917
00:47:51,860 --> 00:47:54,000
it'll be just like New York all over again. Don't worry about it.

918
00:47:51,860 --> 00:47:54,000
这就会像纽约那时一样 别担心

919
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,350
- Yes, but he's an Auror, Queenie said? - Yeah, he's an Auror. So what?

920
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,350
-是的 但奎妮说他是个傲罗 -是的 他是个傲罗 那又如何?

921
00:47:56,620 --> 00:47:57,930
Don't worry about him.

922
00:47:56,620 --> 00:47:57,930
别担心他

923
00:48:00,830 --> 00:48:03,670
What do you think I should say to her, if I see her?

924
00:48:00,830 --> 00:48:03,670
你觉得我见到她应该对她说什么

925
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:08,880
Oh, well, it's best not to plan these things.

926
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:08,880
哦，这个还是顺其自然吧

927
00:48:09,510 --> 00:48:12,680
You know, you just say whatever comes to you in the moment.

928
00:48:09,510 --> 00:48:12,680
你知道的 到时候你想到什么就说什么

929
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:19,770
She has eyes just like a salamander.

930
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:19,770
她的眼睛和火蜥蜴一样

931
00:48:20,810 --> 00:48:21,980
Don't say that.

932
00:48:20,810 --> 00:48:21,980
这还是算了

933
00:48:25,770 --> 00:48:28,650
Nah, look, you just tell her that you missed her.

934
00:48:25,770 --> 00:48:28,650
这样吧 你就直接告诉她你很想她

935
00:48:28,820 --> 00:48:33,200
Right, and then you came all the way to Paris just to find her.

936
00:48:28,820 --> 00:48:33,200
对 然后你大老远跑到巴黎就是为了找她

937
00:48:33,870 --> 00:48:36,080
She'll love that. And then...

938
00:48:33,870 --> 00:48:36,080
她会很开心的 然后

939
00:48:36,950 --> 00:48:40,160
tell her you're losing sleep at night for thinking of her.

940
00:48:36,950 --> 00:48:40,160
然后告诉她你想她想得失眠了

941
00:48:41,750 --> 00:48:43,710
Just don't say anything about no salamanders, all right?

942
00:48:41,750 --> 00:48:43,710
反正不要说任何关于火蜥蜴的事

943
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:44,880
Right. Okay.

944
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:44,880
好 行吧

945
00:48:45,420 --> 00:48:46,750
Hey, hey, hey.

946
00:48:45,420 --> 00:48:46,750
嘿 嘿

947
00:48:48,550 --> 00:48:51,430
It's gonna be all right. We're in this together, pal.

948
00:48:48,550 --> 00:48:51,430
一切都会好起来的 我们一起面对 兄弟

949
00:48:51,970 --> 00:48:55,640
Okay, I'm gonna help you out. I'm gonna help you find Tina, find Queenie

950
00:48:51,970 --> 00:48:55,640
好吧 我会帮你的 帮你找到蒂娜和奎妮

951
00:48:56,510 --> 00:48:58,520
and we'll all be happy again. Just like old times.

952
00:48:56,510 --> 00:48:58,520
然后我们就会像往日一样开心了

953
00:48:58,600 --> 00:48:59,680
Who is this guy?

954
00:48:58,600 --> 00:48:59,680
那个人是谁

955
00:49:01,730 --> 00:49:04,900
He's the only way I can leave the country without documentation.

956
00:49:01,730 --> 00:49:04,900
他是我不经允许离开这个国家的唯一途径

957
00:49:05,110 --> 00:49:07,570
Now, you don't suffer from motion sickness, do you?

958
00:49:05,110 --> 00:49:07,570
你不会晕船吧?

959
00:49:08,070 --> 00:49:09,780
I don't do well on boats, Newt.

960
00:49:08,070 --> 00:49:09,780
纽特 我并不是很适应坐船

961
00:49:10,570 --> 00:49:11,650
You'll be fine.

962
00:49:10,570 --> 00:49:11,650
不会有事的

963
00:49:11,740 --> 00:49:13,780
Stir your stumps-it leaves in one minute!

964
00:49:11,740 --> 00:49:13,780
赶快 一分钟后出发

965
00:49:15,410 --> 00:49:16,410
Fifty Galleons.

966
00:49:15,410 --> 00:49:16,410
50加隆

967
00:49:16,490 --> 00:49:18,160
No, we said thirty.

968
00:49:16,490 --> 00:49:18,160
不，我们说好30的

969
00:49:18,370 --> 00:49:19,790
Thirty to go to France,

970
00:49:18,370 --> 00:49:19,790
30是去法国的路费

971
00:49:20,080 --> 00:49:25,000
twenty not to tell anyone, I seen Newt Scamander leaving the country illegally.

972
00:49:20,080 --> 00:49:25,000
另外20是封口费 不把纽特·斯卡曼德非法离境的事情说出去

973
00:49:26,590 --> 00:49:28,040
Price of fame, pal.

974
00:49:26,590 --> 00:49:28,040
名声的代价啊 兄弟

975
00:49:33,220 --> 00:49:34,470
Ten seconds.

976
00:49:33,220 --> 00:49:34,470
10秒

977
00:49:34,630 --> 00:49:35,510
Eight.

978
00:49:34,630 --> 00:49:35,510
八

979
00:49:35,590 --> 00:49:36,640
Jacob.

980
00:49:35,590 --> 00:49:36,640
雅各布

981
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:37,890
Seven.

982
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:37,890
七

983
00:49:39,140 --> 00:49:40,180
Six.

984
00:49:39,140 --> 00:49:40,180
六

985
00:49:43,270 --> 00:49:47,270
Four. Three. Two.

986
00:49:43,270 --> 00:49:47,270
四、三、二

987
00:49:48,230 --> 00:49:49,520
One.

988
00:49:48,230 --> 00:49:49,520
一

989
00:49:58,950 --> 00:50:00,660
I didn't like that Portkey, Newt.

990
00:49:58,950 --> 00:50:00,660
我不喜欢那个门钥匙 纽特

991
00:50:00,870 --> 00:50:04,080
So you keep saying. Follow me.

992
00:50:00,870 --> 00:50:04,080
你老这么说 跟着我

993
00:50:10,840 --> 00:50:11,840
Confundus.

994
00:50:10,840 --> 00:50:11,840
混淆视听

995
00:50:16,970 --> 00:50:18,600
Come on. That'll wear off in a few minutes.

996
00:50:16,970 --> 00:50:18,600
来吧 咒语几分钟就失效了

997
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:32,650
Appare vestigium.

998
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:32,650
踪迹显形

999
00:50:38,030 --> 00:50:39,070
Accio Niffler...

1000
00:50:38,030 --> 00:50:39,070
嗅嗅飞来

1001
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:43,410
Get looking. Oi! Get looking.

1002
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:43,410
快去找 喂 快去找

1003
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:50,590
That's a Kappa, That's a Japanese water demon.

1004
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:50,590
那是河童 是个日本水怪

1005
00:50:55,510 --> 00:50:56,680
Tina?

1006
00:50:55,510 --> 00:50:56,680
蒂娜

1007
00:50:57,430 --> 00:50:58,430
Tina?

1008
00:50:57,430 --> 00:50:58,430
蒂娜

1009
00:51:05,140 --> 00:51:06,690
What have you found?

1010
00:51:05,140 --> 00:51:06,690
你找到了什么

1011
00:51:11,020 --> 00:51:12,270
And we're licking the dirt now.

1012
00:51:11,020 --> 00:51:12,270
还要吃土的吗

1013
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:27,830
Revelio.

1014
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:27,830
原形立现

1015
00:51:30,380 --> 00:51:32,500
Newt... what made those?

1016
00:51:30,380 --> 00:51:32,500
纽特 这是什么

1017
00:51:33,090 --> 00:51:34,420
That is a Zouwu.

1018
00:51:33,090 --> 00:51:34,420
那是驺吾

1019
00:51:37,090 --> 00:51:41,140
It's a Chinese creature. They are incredibly fast and incredibly powerful.

1020
00:51:37,090 --> 00:51:41,140
是中国的一种神兽 速度极快且力量强大

1021
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:43,640
They can travel a thousand miles in a day

1022
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:43,640
能够日行千里

1023
00:51:44,140 --> 00:51:47,520
and this one could take you from one part of Paris to the next in a single leap.

1024
00:51:44,140 --> 00:51:47,520
一步就能跨越整座巴黎城

1025
00:51:51,650 --> 00:51:52,650
Oh, good boy.

1026
00:51:51,650 --> 00:51:52,650
哦 真棒

1027
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:55,860
Jacob, she was here.

1028
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:55,860
雅各布 她来过

1029
00:51:56,570 --> 00:51:57,860
Tina stood here.

1030
00:51:56,570 --> 00:51:57,860
蒂娜在这里待过

1031
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:00,280
She has incredibly narrow feet, have you noticed?

1032
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:00,280
你注意到了吗 她的脚特别细

1033
00:52:02,450 --> 00:52:04,030
Can't say that I have.

1034
00:52:02,450 --> 00:52:04,030
我还真没在意

1035
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:09,540
Then someone came towards her.

1036
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:09,540
然后有人走向了她

1037
00:52:21,550 --> 00:52:22,890
Avenseguim.

1038
00:52:21,550 --> 00:52:22,890
(追踪咒)

1039
00:52:27,560 --> 00:52:29,180
- Follow that feather. - What?

1040
00:52:27,560 --> 00:52:29,180
-跟着那片羽毛 -什么

1041
00:52:29,350 --> 00:52:30,980
- Jacob, follow the feather. - Follow the feather.

1042
00:52:29,350 --> 00:52:30,980
-雅各布 跟着羽毛 -跟着羽毛

1043
00:52:31,730 --> 00:52:33,060
Where is he?

1044
00:52:31,730 --> 00:52:33,060
它在哪

1045
00:52:34,020 --> 00:52:35,070
Accio Niffler.

1046
00:52:34,020 --> 00:52:35,070
嗅嗅飞来

1047
00:52:42,570 --> 00:52:43,990
Let go of the bucket!

1048
00:52:42,570 --> 00:52:43,990
别提着桶了

1049
00:53:24,110 --> 00:53:27,240
I'm sorry, I don't know what you just said at all.

1050
00:53:24,110 --> 00:53:27,240
对不起 我听不懂

1051
00:53:27,580 --> 00:53:29,830
Welcome to the French Ministry of Magic.

1052
00:53:27,580 --> 00:53:29,830
欢迎来到法国魔法部

1053
00:53:29,990 --> 00:53:31,620
What is your business, please?

1054
00:53:29,990 --> 00:53:31,620
请问有何贵干

1055
00:53:32,750 --> 00:53:36,790
I need to speak to Tina Goldstein.

1056
00:53:32,750 --> 00:53:36,790
我要找蒂娜·戈德斯坦恩

1057
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:41,880
She's an American Auror working on a case here.

1058
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:41,880
她是个美国傲罗 在这里办案

1059
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:47,970
We have no Tina Goldstein here.

1060
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:47,970
这里没有蒂娜·戈德斯坦恩

1061
00:53:49,220 --> 00:53:51,930
No, it's... I'm sorry there must be some sort of mistake.

1062
00:53:49,220 --> 00:53:51,930
不可能的 对不起 一定是哪里弄错了

1063
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:54,980
See, I know she's in Paris, she sent me a postcard.

1064
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:54,980
我知道她在巴黎 还给我寄了一张明信片

1065
00:53:55,190 --> 00:53:58,480
I brought it, I can show it to you. Maybe you can help me find her here?

1066
00:53:55,190 --> 00:53:58,480
我带来了 你看你能不能帮我找她

1067
00:53:58,820 --> 00:53:59,820

00:53:58,820 --> 00:53:59,820
就在这里

1069
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:03,320
Oh rabbits! If you can just wait one moment!

1070
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:03,320
该死 麻烦你等一下

1071
00:54:03,570 --> 00:54:05,910
I know it's in here somewhere. I definitely packed it.

1072
00:54:03,570 --> 00:54:05,910
就在我包里 我肯定收起来了

1073
00:54:06,070 --> 00:54:07,320
Where?

1074
00:54:06,070 --> 00:54:07,320
放哪了

1075
00:54:07,490 --> 00:54:10,660
One second.

1076
00:54:07,490 --> 00:54:10,660
等一下

1077
00:54:45,610 --> 00:54:48,320
- Could we at least stop for a coffee, or like a... - Not now, Jacob.

1078
00:54:45,610 --> 00:54:48,320
- 我们能不能至少停下来喝杯咖啡 或者… - 雅各布 还不是时候

1079
00:54:48,530 --> 00:54:50,950
Chocolate or... just for a second

1080
00:54:48,530 --> 00:54:50,950
或是热巧克力 一下就好

1081
00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:56,500
This way. Come on.

1082
00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:56,500
走这边 快点

1083

Pain Au chocolat? Half a croissant, or like, a bonbon?

1084
00:54:57,120 --> 00:55:00,420
(法语)巧克力面包要吗 半块羊角面包或者糖果

1085
00:55:00,630 --> 00:55:01,800
This way.

1086
00:55:00,630 --> 00:55:01,800
这边

1087
00:55:06,930 --> 00:55:07,930

00:55:22,070 --> 00:55:23,070
Jacob?

1090
00:55:22,070 --> 00:55:23,070
雅各布

1091
00:56:09,610 --> 00:56:10,530
Madame?

1092
00:56:09,610 --> 00:56:10,530
(法语)女士

1093
00:56:18,660 --> 00:56:19,830
(法语)你还好吗 女士

1094
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:32,390
删剪片段

1095
00:57:48,170 --> 00:57:49,420
She’s home.

1096
00:57:48,170 --> 00:57:49,420
她在家

1097
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:28,420
Qui est là?

1098
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:28,420
(法语)是谁啊

1099
00:58:33,260 --> 00:58:35,430
C’est votre fils, madame.

1100
00:58:33,260 --> 00:58:35,430
(法语) 您的儿子来了 夫人

1101
00:58:35,800 --> 00:58:36,840
Qui est-ce?

1102
00:58:35,800 --> 00:58:36,840
(法语) 你是谁

1103
00:58:36,930 --> 00:58:38,220
Are you Irma?

1104
00:58:36,930 --> 00:58:38,220
你是厄玛吗

1105
00:58:39,890 --> 00:58:41,890
Are you Irma Dugart?

1106
00:58:39,890 --> 00:58:41,890
你是…你是厄玛·杜加尔德吗

1107
00:58:43,430 --> 00:58:47,810
I’m sorry. Your name is on my adoption paper.

1108
00:58:43,430 --> 00:58:47,810
抱歉 我的领养文件上写的是你的名字

1109
00:58:49,690 --> 00:58:51,070
Does this make sense?

1110
00:58:49,690 --> 00:58:51,070
能想起什么吗

1111
00:58:53,320 --> 00:58:55,570
You gave me to Mrs. Bareborn in New York.

1112
00:58:53,320 --> 00:58:55,570
你把我交给纽约的拜尔伯恩太太了

1113
00:59:15,050 --> 00:59:18,680
I’m not your mother. I am just a servant.

1114
00:59:15,050 --> 00:59:18,680
我不是你妈妈 我只是个仆人

1115
00:59:22,850 --> 00:59:25,060
You were a so beautiful baby.

1116
00:59:22,850 --> 00:59:25,060
你那时是个漂亮娃娃

1117
00:59:27,640 --> 00:59:29,730
And you are a beautiful man.

1118
00:59:27,640 --> 00:59:29,730
现在长成帅小伙了

1119
00:59:40,410 --> 00:59:42,700
I didn’t want to leave you there.

1120
00:59:40,410 --> 00:59:42,700
我没想把你留在那儿

1121
00:59:43,370 --> 00:59:45,160
Why didn’t they want me?

1122
00:59:43,370 --> 00:59:45,160
他们为什么不想要我

1123
00:59:49,870 --> 00:59:52,750
Why is your name on my adoption paper?

1124
00:59:49,870 --> 00:59:52,750
为什么我的领养文件上是你的名字

1125
00:59:52,920 --> 00:59:55,920
I took you to Mrs. Bareborn

1126
00:59:52,920 --> 00:59:55,920
我带你去拜尔本太太那儿

1127
00:59:56,130 --> 00:59:59,970
because she was supposed to look after you.

1128
00:59:56,130 --> 00:59:59,970
想着她能照顾你

1129
01:02:07,390 --> 01:02:08,800
She’s dead.

1130
01:02:07,390 --> 01:02:08,800
她死了

1131
01:02:11,430 --> 01:02:13,430
How did the boy take it?

1132
01:02:11,430 --> 01:02:13,430
那男孩反应如何？

1133
01:02:14,980 --> 01:02:16,400
He’s sensitive.

1134
01:02:14,980 --> 01:02:16,400
他很敏感

1135
01:02:18,360 --> 01:02:21,110
The ministry won’t be happy when I tell them I missed.

1136
01:02:18,360 --> 01:02:21,110
魔法部知道我失手了 一定不会高兴的

1137
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:24,070
-I know my reputation.

1138
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:24,070
-我清楚我的名声

1139
01:02:24,280 --> 01:02:28,070
Listen to me. The disapproval of cowards is praise to the brave.

1140
01:02:24,280 --> 01:02:28,070
听我说 懦夫的反对是对勇者的赞扬

1141
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:34,330
Your name will be written in glory when wizards rule the world.

1142
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:34,330
当巫师统治世界 你的姓名将伴随荣光

1143
01:02:35,330 --> 01:02:37,670
And the clock is ticking faster.

1144
01:02:35,330 --> 01:02:37,670
这一天不会远了

1145
01:02:38,580 --> 01:02:42,090
Watch over Credence. Keep him safe.

1146
01:02:38,580 --> 01:02:42,090
照顾好克雷登斯 确保他安全

1147
01:02:43,260 --> 01:02:44,920
For the Greater Good.

1148
01:02:43,260 --> 01:02:44,920
为了更伟大的利益

1149
01:02:46,430 --> 01:02:48,050
For the Greater Good.

1150
01:02:46,430 --> 01:02:48,050
为了更伟大的利益

1151
01:02:51,180 --> 01:02:52,810
You know what I miss about Queenie?

1152
01:02:51,180 --> 01:02:52,810
你知道我想念奎妮什么吗

1153
01:02:55,480 --> 01:02:56,810
Everything.

1154
01:02:55,480 --> 01:02:56,810
一切

1155
01:02:59,310 --> 01:03:01,480
I even miss the stuff that drove me nuts.

1156
01:02:59,310 --> 01:03:01,480
我甚至怀念那些让我发疯的东西

1157
01:03:01,980 --> 01:03:03,480
Like the mind reading.

1158
01:03:01,980 --> 01:03:03,480
比如读心术

1159
01:03:10,030 --> 01:03:13,450
I was happy to have someone like her even interested in…

1160
01:03:10,030 --> 01:03:13,450
她那样的人竟然会对我感兴趣…

1161
01:03:13,540 --> 01:03:15,250
Anything I thought.

1162
01:03:13,540 --> 01:03:15,250
我觉得很幸福

1163
01:03:16,830 --> 01:03:18,420
You know what I mean?

1164
01:03:16,830 --> 01:03:18,420
你明白我的意思吗

1165
01:03:19,500 --> 01:03:20,500
Sorry?

1166
01:03:19,500 --> 01:03:20,500
你说啥

1167
01:03:25,720 --> 01:03:29,220
I was saying… You’re sure the guy is here we’re looking for?

1168
01:03:25,720 --> 01:03:29,220
我是说 你确定我们要找的人就在这里?

1169
01:03:29,300 --> 01:03:31,640
Definitely. The feather said so.

1170
01:03:29,300 --> 01:03:31,640
肯定没错 羽毛是这么指示的

1171
01:04:02,040 --> 01:04:04,380
-Is that the guy we’re looking for? –Yes.

1172
01:04:02,040 --> 01:04:04,380
-那就是我们要找的人吗? -是的

1173
01:04:09,970 --> 01:04:11,010
Sorry.

1174
01:04:09,970 --> 01:04:11,010
抱歉

1175
01:04:12,140 --> 01:04:14,220
Bonjour… Bonjour, monsieur.

1176
01:04:12,140 --> 01:04:14,220
(法语)您好… 您好 先生

1177
01:04:15,350 --> 01:04:16,930
Wait, no, sorry

1178
01:04:15,350 --> 01:04:16,930
等等，抱歉

1179
01:04:17,020 --> 01:04:20,270
We were just wondering if you came across a friend of ours.

1180
01:04:17,020 --> 01:04:20,270
我们只是想知道你是否遇到过我们的一个朋友…

1181
01:04:21,020 --> 01:04:22,150
Tina Goldstein.

1182
01:04:21,020 --> 01:04:22,150
蒂娜·戈德斯坦恩

1183
01:04:22,650 --> 01:04:24,940
Messieurs, Paris is a large city.

1184
01:04:22,650 --> 01:04:24,940
先生们 巴黎可是座大城市

1185
01:04:25,020 --> 01:04:25,860
She’s an auror.

1186
01:04:25,020 --> 01:04:25,860
她是个傲罗

1187
01:04:27,110 --> 01:04:31,280
When an auror goes missing the Ministry tends to come looking, so…

1188
01:04:27,110 --> 01:04:31,280
傲罗失踪的话魔法部会来找人 所以…

1189
01:04:33,030 --> 01:04:35,950
I suppose it would probably be better if we reported her absence.

1190
01:04:33,030 --> 01:04:35,950
我想我们还是回去上报失踪人口算了

1191
01:04:36,490 --> 01:04:37,870
Is she tall? Dark?

1192
01:04:36,490 --> 01:04:37,870
她个子高吗 皮肤黑吗

1193
01:04:39,500 --> 01:04:40,710
Rather…

1194
01:04:39,500 --> 01:04:40,710
是不是比较…

1195
01:04:40,870 --> 01:04:42,040
-Serious. –Beautiful.

1196
01:04:40,870 --> 01:04:42,040
-很严肃 –很漂亮

1197
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:47,300
Yeah, what I meant to say was she’s very—very pretty.

1198
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:47,300
我想说的是 她非常--非常漂亮

1199
01:04:48,050 --> 01:04:51,340
I think I saw someone like this last night.

1200
01:04:48,050 --> 01:04:51,340
我想我昨晚见过这样的人

1201
01:04:53,550 --> 01:04:55,260
Perhaps if I showed you where?

1202
01:04:53,550 --> 01:04:55,260
也许我可以带你们去找她

1203
01:04:55,430 --> 01:04:56,640
If you don’t mind that would be…

1204
01:04:55,430 --> 01:04:56,640
如果你不介意的话...

1205
01:04:57,930 --> 01:04:59,560
-That would be lovely. –Sure.

1206
01:04:57,930 --> 01:04:59,560
-那太好了 –请随我来

1207
01:05:38,100 --> 01:05:39,140
Tina?

1208
01:05:38,100 --> 01:05:39,140
蒂娜

1209
01:05:40,720 --> 01:05:41,680
Newt!

1210
01:05:40,720 --> 01:05:41,680
纽特

1211
01:05:41,770 --> 01:05:43,140
Expelliarmus

1212
01:05:41,770 --> 01:05:43,140
除你武器

1213
01:05:45,480 --> 01:05:48,440
My apologies, Mr. Scamander.

1214
01:05:45,480 --> 01:05:48,440
对不起 斯卡曼德先生

1215
01:05:49,110 --> 01:05:52,530
I shall return and release you once Credence is dead.

1216
01:05:49,110 --> 01:05:52,530
克雷登斯一死 我就回来放你们出去

1217
01:05:52,700 --> 01:05:53,610
Kama, wait!

1218
01:05:52,700 --> 01:05:53,610
卡玛，等等！

1219
01:05:53,700 --> 01:05:57,580
You see, whether he dies, or I do.

1220
01:05:53,700 --> 01:05:57,580
不是他死 就是我亡

1221
01:05:58,620 --> 01:05:59,950
Oh, no.

1222
01:05:58,620 --> 01:05:59,950
不不不

1223
01:06:00,120 --> 01:06:02,580
No, no, no--

1224
01:06:00,120 --> 01:06:02,580
哦不不不

1225
01:06:13,380 --> 01:06:15,260
Well, that was not the best out for a rescue attempt.

1226
01:06:13,380 --> 01:06:15,260
营救任务进行得可不太顺利

1227
01:06:15,510 --> 01:06:19,560
Oh this was a rescue attempt? You just lost me my only lead.

1228
01:06:15,510 --> 01:06:19,560
这是一次营救行动吗 你刚刚害我丢掉唯一的线索

1229
01:06:19,890 --> 01:06:22,850
Well, how was the interrogation going before we turned up?

1230
01:06:19,890 --> 01:06:22,850
好吧 在我们出现前审讯怎么样

1231
01:06:26,150 --> 01:06:27,060
Newt!

1232
01:06:26,150 --> 01:06:27,060
纽特

1233
01:06:31,900 --> 01:06:33,070
Well done, Pick.

1234
01:06:31,900 --> 01:06:33,070
干得好 皮克

1235
01:06:35,530 --> 01:06:37,280
You said you needed this man?

1236
01:06:35,530 --> 01:06:37,280
你说你需要这个人?

1237
01:06:37,950 --> 01:06:41,910
Yes. I think this man knows where Credence is, Mr. Scamander.

1238
01:06:37,950 --> 01:06:41,910
对 我想这个人知道克雷登斯在哪里 斯卡曼德先生

1239
01:06:46,920 --> 01:06:48,420
Well, that'll be the Zouwu.

1240
01:06:46,920 --> 01:06:48,420
那一定就是驺吾了

1241
01:07:08,690 --> 01:07:09,980
Come on, Newt, get out of there!

1242
01:07:08,690 --> 01:07:09,980
来啊 纽特 快离开那儿

1243
01:08:02,780 --> 01:08:03,660
Come on

1244
01:08:02,780 --> 01:08:03,660
走了

1245
01:08:35,610 --> 01:08:39,530
What were the three biggest mistakes that you made last time?

1246
01:08:35,610 --> 01:08:39,530
你上次犯的最大的三个错误是什么?

1247
01:08:40,900 --> 01:08:42,490
Caught by surprise, sir.

1248
01:08:40,900 --> 01:08:42,490
被突袭而措手不及 先生

1249
01:08:42,820 --> 01:08:43,870
What else?

1250
01:08:42,820 --> 01:08:43,870
还有呢

1251
01:08:44,030 --> 01:08:45,950
Didn't parry before counter-curse, sir.

1252
01:08:44,030 --> 01:08:45,950
是在破解咒前没有回避 老师

1253
01:08:46,040 --> 01:08:48,160
Very good. And the last one...

1254
01:08:46,040 --> 01:08:48,160
很好 那最后一个...

1255
01:08:48,750 --> 01:08:51,420
the most important one?

1256
01:08:48,750 --> 01:08:51,420
最重要的那个错误是什么?

1257
01:08:58,630 --> 01:09:00,590
Not learning from the first two.

1258
01:08:58,630 --> 01:09:00,590
没从前两个错误里学到教训

1259
01:09:03,590 --> 01:09:06,470
This is a school, you've no right

1260
01:09:03,590 --> 01:09:06,470
这里是学校 你们无权闯入

1261
01:09:06,560 --> 01:09:10,560
I'm the Head of Magical Law Enforcement and I have the right to go wherever I please.

1262
01:09:06,560 --> 01:09:10,560
我是魔法法律执行司的司长 我想去哪里都可以

1263
01:09:12,690 --> 01:09:14,150
Out of here.

1264
01:09:12,690 --> 01:09:14,150
你们出去

1265
01:09:18,610 --> 01:09:20,400
Go with Professor McGonagall, please.

1266
01:09:18,610 --> 01:09:20,400
你们和麦格教授一起出去吧

1267
01:09:27,870 --> 01:09:29,330
He's the best teacher we've got.

1268
01:09:27,870 --> 01:09:29,330
他是我们最好的老师

1269
01:09:29,410 --> 01:09:30,450
- Thanks, McClaggan. - Get out!

1270
01:09:29,410 --> 01:09:30,450
-谢谢你 麦克拉根 -出去

1271
01:09:31,460 --> 01:09:32,790
Come, McClaggan.

1272
01:09:31,460 --> 01:09:32,790
走吧 麦克拉根

1273
01:09:37,960 --> 01:09:39,920
Newt Scamander is in Paris.

1274
01:09:37,960 --> 01:09:39,920
纽特·斯卡曼德现在在巴黎

1275
01:09:41,510 --> 01:09:42,340
Really?

1276
01:09:41,510 --> 01:09:42,340
真的吗

1277
01:09:42,420 --> 01:09:44,590
Cut the pretense. I know he's there on your orders.

1278
01:09:42,420 --> 01:09:44,590
少装了 我知道他是奉你之命去的

1279
01:09:45,220 --> 01:09:46,850
If you'd ever had the pleasure to teach him, you'd

1280
01:09:45,220 --> 01:09:46,850
如果你有幸教过纽特

1281
01:09:46,930 --> 01:09:49,640
know Newt is not a great follower of orders.

1282
01:09:46,930 --> 01:09:49,640
你就会知道他不是个会乖乖听话的孩子

1283
01:09:53,230 --> 01:09:55,400
You've read The Predictions of Tycho Dodonus??

1284
01:09:53,230 --> 01:09:55,400
你读过泰克 多多纳斯的预言录吗

1285
01:09:55,230 --> 01:09:56,720
Mmm. Many years ago.

1286
01:09:55,230 --> 01:09:56,720
多年前读过

1287
01:09:56,720 --> 01:09:56,730
多年前读过

1288
01:09:57,480 --> 01:10:01,140
"A son cruelly banished. Despair of the daughter."

1289
01:09:57,480 --> 01:10:01,140
“被残忍放逐之子 伤心且绝望之女”

1290
01:10:01,320 --> 01:10:02,850
- "Return..." - Yes, I know it.

1291
01:10:01,320 --> 01:10:02,850
-“伟大…” -我知道预言

1292
01:10:05,700 --> 01:10:08,280
There's a rumor this prediction refers to the Obscurial.

1293
01:10:05,700 --> 01:10:08,280
有谣言说这个预言指的是默然者

1294
01:10:09,330 --> 01:10:11,280
他们说格林德沃想要…

1295
01:10:09,330 --> 01:10:11,280
They say that Grindelwald wants...

1296
01:10:11,280 --> 01:10:13,320
As a highborn henchman. I've heard the rumor.

1297
01:10:11,280 --> 01:10:13,320
一个出身名门的亲信 我听过传闻

1298
01:10:13,410 --> 01:10:16,200
And yet, Scamander appears wherever the Obscurial goes,

1299
01:10:13,410 --> 01:10:16,200
但无论默然者在哪现身 斯卡曼德都会及时出现

1300
01:10:17,540 --> 01:10:18,950
to protect him.

1301
01:10:17,540 --> 01:10:18,950
去保护他

1302
01:10:18,950 --> 01:10:18,960
去保护他

1303
01:10:19,710 --> 01:10:24,290
Meanwhile, you've built up quite the little network of international contacts.

1304
01:10:19,710 --> 01:10:24,290
在此同时 你也结交了不少的国际友人

1305
01:10:24,470 --> 01:10:27,710
However long you keep me and my friends under surveillance,

1306
01:10:24,470 --> 01:10:27,710
不管你想监视我和我朋友多久

1307
01:10:27,890 --> 01:10:31,220
you're not going to discover plots against you, Travers,

1308
01:10:27,890 --> 01:10:31,220
都不会发现我们有任何地方违背你 特拉弗斯

1309
01:10:31,310 --> 01:10:34,970
because we want the same thing. The defeat of Grindelwald.

1310
01:10:31,310 --> 01:10:34,970
因为我们想要的是一样的 就是去打败格林德沃

1311
01:10:38,100 --> 01:10:42,020
But I warn you, your policies of suppression and violence

1312
01:10:38,100 --> 01:10:42,020
但我警告你 运用镇压和暴力的手段

1313
01:10:42,820 --> 01:10:44,900
are pushing supporters into his arms.

1314
01:10:42,820 --> 01:10:44,900
只会把人逼到他那一方去

1315
01:10:44,900 --> 01:10:46,510
I'm not interested in your warnings.

1316
01:10:44,900 --> 01:10:46,510
我对你的警告不感兴趣

1317
01:10:49,200 --> 01:10:50,690
Now...

1318
01:10:49,200 --> 01:10:50,690
现在

1319
01:10:51,830 --> 01:10:55,570
It pains me to say it because I don't like you...

1320
01:10:51,830 --> 01:10:55,570
我不想这么说 因为我不喜欢你

1321
01:10:57,910 --> 01:10:57,920
但…

1322
01:10:57,920 --> 01:10:58,920
But...

1323
01:10:57,920 --> 01:10:58,920
但…

1324
01:11:00,830 --> 01:11:00,840
能与他抗衡的巫师只有你

1325
01:11:00,840 --> 01:11:04,170
You are the only wizard who is his equal.

1326
01:11:00,840 --> 01:11:04,170
能与他抗衡的巫师只有你

1327
01:11:08,420 --> 01:11:08,430
我需要你去对抗他

1328
01:11:08,430 --> 01:11:10,010
I need you to fight him.

1329
01:11:08,430 --> 01:11:10,010
我需要你去对抗他

1330
01:11:15,770 --> 01:11:16,970
I can't.

1331
01:11:15,770 --> 01:11:16,970
我做不到

1332
01:11:21,180 --> 01:11:21,190
是因为这个吗？

1333
01:11:21,190 --> 01:11:22,600
Because of this?

1334
01:11:21,190 --> 01:11:22,600
是因为这个吗？

1335
01:11:31,200 --> 01:11:33,740
You and Grindelwald were as close as brothers.

1336
01:11:31,200 --> 01:11:33,740
你与格林德沃曾经亲如兄弟

1337
01:11:35,540 --> 01:11:37,370
Oh, we were closer than brothers.

1338
01:11:35,540 --> 01:11:37,370
我们比亲兄弟还亲

1339
01:11:48,260 --> 01:11:50,670
Will you fight him?

1340
01:11:48,260 --> 01:11:50,670
你愿意对抗他吗?

1341
01:11:52,760 --> 01:11:53,970
I can't.

1342
01:11:52,760 --> 01:11:53,970
我不能

1343
01:11:55,520 --> 01:11:57,630
Well, then you have chosen your side.

1344
01:11:55,520 --> 01:11:57,630
那你已经选好你的立场了

1345
01:11:57,630 --> 01:11:57,640
那你已经选好你的立场了

1346
01:12:00,730 --> 01:12:03,440
From now on, I shall know every spell you cast.

1347
01:12:00,730 --> 01:12:03,440
从现在起 我将知道你念的每一个咒语

1348
01:12:03,820 --> 01:12:05,600
I'm doubling the watch on you,

1349
01:12:03,820 --> 01:12:05,600
我会派双倍人马监视你

1350
01:12:05,780 --> 01:12:08,190
and you will no longer teach Defense Against the Dark Arts.

1351
01:12:05,780 --> 01:12:08,190
你也不再能教黑魔法防御术了

1352
01:12:10,570 --> 01:12:12,110
Where's Leta? We need to go to Paris.

1353
01:12:10,570 --> 01:12:12,110
莉塔在哪？我们得赶往巴黎

1354
01:12:18,540 --> 01:12:19,540
Theseus.

1355
01:12:18,540 --> 01:12:19,540
忒修斯

1356
01:12:20,370 --> 01:12:22,580
忒修斯 若格林德沃召集大型集会

1357
01:12:20,370 --> 01:12:22,580
Theseus, if Grindelwald calls a rally,

1358
01:12:24,250 --> 01:12:25,370
don't try and break it up.

1359
01:12:24,250 --> 01:12:25,370
别试图去破坏

1360
01:12:25,370 --> 01:12:25,380
别试图去破坏

1361
01:12:26,050 --> 01:12:26,090
Don't let Travers send you in there.

1362
01:12:26,090 --> 01:12:27,830
别让特弗拉斯把你派进去

1363
01:12:26,090 --> 01:12:27,830
Don't let Travers send you in there.

1364
01:12:29,700 --> 01:12:29,720
若你曾相信过我…

1365
01:12:29,720 --> 01:12:30,960
If you ever trusted me...

1366
01:12:29,720 --> 01:12:30,960
若你曾相信过我…

1367
01:12:31,130 --> 01:12:32,210
Theseus.

1368
01:12:31,130 --> 01:12:32,210
忒修斯

1369
01:12:33,340 --> 01:12:34,340
Theseus!

1370
01:12:33,340 --> 01:12:34,340
忒修斯

1371
01:13:15,720 --> 01:13:17,740
Even the name Lestrange makes me feel sick.

1372
01:13:15,720 --> 01:13:17,740
光想到莱斯特兰奇这个姓就让我恶心

1373
01:13:17,760 --> 01:13:19,380
You know she stays here every vacation.

1374
01:13:17,760 --> 01:13:19,380
你也知道她每次放假都留在学校

1375
01:13:19,560 --> 01:13:21,270
Her family don't actually want her home.

1376
01:13:19,560 --> 01:13:21,270
她家人根本不希望她回家

1377
01:13:21,270 --> 01:13:21,300
Her family don't actually want her home.

1378
01:13:21,480 --> 01:13:22,910
I don't blame them. She's so annoying.

1379
01:13:21,480 --> 01:13:22,910
也不怪他们 她实在太讨人厌

1380
01:13:22,940 --> 01:13:24,100
Did you see her last week?

1381
01:13:22,940 --> 01:13:24,100
你上个礼拜看到她了吗

1382
01:13:24,270 --> 01:13:25,350
Oscausi!

1383
01:13:24,270 --> 01:13:25,350
闭而不语

1384
01:13:30,530 --> 01:13:31,980
Professor McGonagall!

1385
01:13:30,530 --> 01:13:31,980
麦格教授

1386
01:13:32,150 --> 01:13:33,270
Lestrange has done it again!

1387
01:13:32,150 --> 01:13:33,270
莱斯特兰奇又违反校规了

1388
01:13:33,450 --> 01:13:35,530
Lestrange, stop running!

1389
01:13:33,450 --> 01:13:35,530
莱斯特兰奇 别跑

1390
01:13:35,700 --> 01:13:35,740
- Lestrange! Disobedient children. - Leta, come back!

1391
01:13:35,740 --> 01:13:38,530
-莱斯特兰奇！不听话的孩子！快停下！ -莉塔 回来

1392
01:13:35,740 --> 01:13:38,530
- Lestrange! Disobedient children. - Leta, come back!

1393
01:13:38,700 --> 01:13:40,860
Stop! Shame on the House of Slytherin.

1394
01:13:38,700 --> 01:13:40,860
别跑了 真让斯莱特林学院蒙羞

1395
01:13:40,950 --> 01:13:43,290
A hundred points! Two hundred!

1396
01:13:40,950 --> 01:13:43,290
扣一百分 扣两百分

1397
01:13:43,460 --> 01:13:45,120
Get back here, right now!

1398
01:13:43,460 --> 01:13:45,120
给我回来 立马

1399
01:13:46,670 --> 01:13:49,960
Children, stop it! You, stop! Come back!

1400
01:13:46,670 --> 01:13:49,960
孩子们 停下来！你 停下来！回来！

1401
01:13:50,130 --> 01:13:52,290
- Out of my way! - Where has she gone?

1402
01:13:50,130 --> 01:13:52,290
-别挡路 -她去哪了？

1403
01:13:52,470 --> 01:13:54,250
I think she went that way!

1404
01:13:52,470 --> 01:13:54,250
我想她往那边去了

1405
01:13:54,250 --> 01:13:54,260
我想她往那边去了

1406
01:13:57,600 --> 01:13:59,590
Miss, it was Lestrange. She's horrible.

1407
01:13:57,600 --> 01:13:59,590
老师 是莱斯特兰奇干的！她最坏了！

1408
01:14:09,270 --> 01:14:11,260
Scamander, why aren't you packing?

1409
01:14:09,270 --> 01:14:11,260
斯卡曼德 你为什么不收拾行李

1410
01:14:11,440 --> 01:14:13,060
I'm not going home.

1411
01:14:11,440 --> 01:14:13,060
我不回家

1412
01:14:14,070 --> 01:14:15,070
Why not?

1413
01:14:14,070 --> 01:14:15,070
为什么

1414
01:14:15,860 --> 01:14:17,690
He needs me.

1415
01:14:15,860 --> 01:14:17,690
它需要我

1416
01:14:23,250 --> 01:14:24,860
He was hurt.

1417
01:14:23,250 --> 01:14:24,860
它受伤了

1418
01:14:31,920 --> 01:14:33,250
What is that?

1419
01:14:31,920 --> 01:14:33,250
那是什么

1420
01:14:33,920 --> 01:14:35,290
A raven chick.

1421
01:14:33,920 --> 01:14:35,290
一只小渡鸦

1422
01:14:37,010 --> 01:14:39,380
Isn't the raven your family emblem?

1423
01:14:37,010 --> 01:14:39,380
渡鸦不是你家族的标志么

1424
01:14:39,550 --> 01:14:40,870
Yes, it is.

1425
01:14:39,550 --> 01:14:40,870
对 没错

1426
01:14:53,780 --> 01:14:54,980
All right, Newt.

1427
01:14:53,780 --> 01:14:54,980
好了 纽特

1428
01:14:55,570 --> 01:14:56,930
Be brave.

1429
01:14:55,570 --> 01:14:56,930
勇敢一点

1430
01:15:01,410 --> 01:15:02,900
That's an unusual one.

1431
01:15:01,410 --> 01:15:02,900
真是不同寻常

1432
01:15:03,200 --> 01:15:07,450
So Mr. Scamander fears what more than anything else in the world?

1433
01:15:03,200 --> 01:15:07,450
所以斯卡曼德先生 在人生中最畏惧的是

1434
01:15:08,030 --> 01:15:08,040
被困在办公室里工作 老师

1435
01:15:08,040 --> 01:15:10,200
Having to work in an office, sir.

1436
01:15:08,040 --> 01:15:10,200
被困在办公室里工作 老师

1437
01:15:11,340 --> 01:15:12,830
Go ahead, Newt.

1438
01:15:11,340 --> 01:15:12,830
继续 纽特

1439
01:15:16,300 --> 01:15:17,130
Riddikulus.

1440
01:15:16,300 --> 01:15:17,130
滑稽滑稽

1441
01:15:17,720 --> 01:15:17,760
漂亮

1442
01:15:17,760 --> 01:15:18,760
Well done.

1443
01:15:17,760 --> 01:15:18,760
漂亮

1444
01:15:19,140 --> 01:15:21,220
Good job. Leta.

1445
01:15:19,140 --> 01:15:21,220
干得好 莉塔

1446
01:15:24,140 --> 01:15:25,380
It's only a Boggart.

1447
01:15:24,140 --> 01:15:25,380
就是一只博格特

1448
01:15:25,560 --> 01:15:27,510
It can't hurt you.

1449
01:15:25,560 --> 01:15:27,510
它伤害不了你

1450
01:15:29,560 --> 01:15:31,970
Everyone is scared of something.

1451
01:15:29,560 --> 01:15:31,970
每个人都有害怕的东西

1452
01:15:33,690 --> 01:15:35,350
I've been looking forward to this.

1453
01:15:33,690 --> 01:15:35,350
我一直很期待这一刻

1454
01:16:20,030 --> 01:16:22,020
I don't want to talk about it.

1455
01:16:20,030 --> 01:16:22,020
我不想谈那件事

1456
01:16:37,670 --> 01:16:39,000
They know me,

1457
01:16:37,670 --> 01:16:39,000
它们认识我

1458
01:16:40,300 --> 01:16:41,550
or they'd hide.

1459
01:16:40,300 --> 01:16:41,550
不然会躲起来

1460
01:16:44,680 --> 01:16:47,170
They only nest in trees with wand-quality wood.

1461
01:16:44,680 --> 01:16:47,170
它们只在木质能制成魔杖的树上筑巢

1462
01:16:49,050 --> 01:16:49,060
你知道吗

1463
01:16:49,060 --> 01:16:50,720
Did you know that?

1464
01:16:49,060 --> 01:16:50,720
你知道吗

1465
01:16:52,520 --> 01:16:55,010
And they have very complex social lives.

1466
01:16:52,520 --> 01:16:55,010
它们也有很复杂的社交生活

1467
01:16:56,730 --> 01:16:59,690
If you watch them for long enough, you realize...

1468
01:16:56,730 --> 01:16:59,690
要是你观察得够久 就会发现的…

1469
01:17:17,630 --> 01:17:20,540
Hello, Leta. This is a surprise.

1470
01:17:17,630 --> 01:17:20,540
嗨，莉塔，真让人讶异

1471
01:17:24,140 --> 01:17:26,750
Finding me in a classroom?

1472
01:17:24,140 --> 01:17:26,750
会在教室里看到我?

1473
01:17:27,930 --> 01:17:29,390
Was I such a bad student?

1474
01:17:27,930 --> 01:17:29,390
我是坏学生吗?

1475
01:17:29,560 --> 01:17:31,200
On the contrary, you were one of my cleverest.

1476
01:17:29,560 --> 01:17:31,200
恰恰相反 你是我最聪明的学生之一

1477
01:17:31,230 --> 01:17:33,140
I said "bad," not "stupid."

1478
01:17:31,230 --> 01:17:33,140
我说坏学生 不是笨学生

1479
01:17:38,850 --> 01:17:38,860
别费心回答了

1480
01:17:38,860 --> 01:17:40,350
Don't bother answering.

1481
01:17:38,860 --> 01:17:40,350
别费心回答了

1482
01:17:42,020 --> 01:17:42,030
我知道你没喜欢过我

1483
01:17:42,030 --> 01:17:43,070
I know you never liked me.

1484
01:17:42,030 --> 01:17:43,070
我知道你没喜欢过我

1485
01:17:43,200 --> 01:17:44,530
You're wrong.

1486
01:17:43,200 --> 01:17:44,530
那你错了

1487
01:17:45,410 --> 01:17:46,440
我从不认为你坏

1488
01:17:45,410 --> 01:17:46,440
I never thought you bad.

1489
01:17:46,620 --> 01:17:49,070
You were alone, then. Everybody else did.

1490
01:17:46,620 --> 01:17:49,070
那你是个例外 所有人都这么觉得

1491
01:17:49,860 --> 01:17:49,870
而且他们是对的

1492
01:17:49,870 --> 01:17:51,280
And they were right.

1493
01:17:49,870 --> 01:17:51,280
而且他们是对的

1494
01:17:52,570 --> 01:17:52,580
我的确很坏

1495
01:17:52,580 --> 01:17:53,990
I was wicked.

1496
01:17:52,580 --> 01:17:53,990
我的确很坏

1497
01:17:54,920 --> 01:17:56,620
Leta, I know how painful

1498
01:17:54,920 --> 01:17:56,620
莉塔 我了解那些

1499
01:17:56,760 --> 01:17:59,130
the rumors about your brother Corvus must be for you.

1500
01:17:56,760 --> 01:17:59,130
关于你弟弟考乌斯的谣言 令你有多痛苦

1501
01:17:59,170 --> 01:18:00,330
No, you don't.

1502
01:17:59,170 --> 01:18:00,330
不 你不了解

1503
01:18:02,050 --> 01:18:04,500
Not unless you had a brother who died, too.

1504
01:18:02,050 --> 01:18:04,500
除非你也有个死去的弟弟

1505
01:18:04,680 --> 01:18:06,760
In my case, it was my sister.

1506
01:18:04,680 --> 01:18:06,760
我妹妹不在了

1507
01:18:09,720 --> 01:18:11,340
Did you love her?

1508
01:18:09,720 --> 01:18:11,340
你爱她吗

1509
01:18:19,970 --> 01:18:19,980
我应该更爱她的

1510
01:18:19,980 --> 01:18:21,720
Not as well as I should have done.

1511
01:18:19,980 --> 01:18:21,720
我应该更爱她的

1512
01:18:25,650 --> 01:18:27,490
Never too late to free yourself.

1513
01:18:25,650 --> 01:18:27,490
让自己释怀是从来不会晚

1514
01:18:29,860 --> 01:18:29,870
有人说 忏悔是一种解脱 能让你如释重负

1515
01:18:29,870 --> 01:18:34,360
Confession is a relief, I'm told. A great weight lifted.

1516
01:18:29,870 --> 01:18:34,360
有人说 忏悔是一种解脱 能让你如释重负

1517
01:18:38,450 --> 01:18:38,460
多年来悔恨一直伴随着我

1518
01:18:38,460 --> 01:18:40,450
Regret is my constant companion.

1519
01:18:38,460 --> 01:18:40,450
多年来悔恨一直伴随着我

1520
01:18:41,500 --> 01:18:43,660
Do not let it become yours.

1521
01:18:41,500 --> 01:18:43,660
别让它也变成你的心魔

1522
01:18:54,020 --> 01:18:56,100
Oh! No, thank you.

1523
01:18:54,020 --> 01:18:56,100
不用了 谢谢

1524
01:18:56,550 --> 01:18:57,150
Well...

1525
01:18:56,550 --> 01:18:57,150
好了

1526
01:18:57,970 --> 01:18:59,640
You've been really kind,

1527
01:18:57,970 --> 01:18:59,640
你人实在太好了

1528
01:18:59,810 --> 01:19:03,980
but my sister Tina's probably worried sick about me.

1529
01:18:59,810 --> 01:19:03,980
我姐姐蒂娜大概急着找我找疯了

1530
01:19:04,150 --> 01:19:07,140
You know, banging on all the doors and things,

1531
01:19:04,150 --> 01:19:07,140
像是到处乱敲门之类的

1532
01:19:08,700 --> 01:19:09,940
我还是走好了

1533
01:19:08,700 --> 01:19:09,940
so I think I'd better be going.

1534
01:19:10,030 --> 01:19:10,070
But you haven't met your host.

1535
01:19:10,070 --> 01:19:12,110
但你还没见到主人

1536
01:19:10,070 --> 01:19:12,110
But you haven't met your host.

1537
01:19:12,830 --> 01:19:14,030
Oh, are you married?

1538
01:19:12,830 --> 01:19:14,030
噢 你结婚了?

1539
01:19:15,070 --> 01:19:15,080
应该说…

1540
01:19:15,080 --> 01:19:16,360
Let's say,

1541
01:19:15,080 --> 01:19:16,360
应该说…

1542
01:19:17,580 --> 01:19:19,540
deeply committed.

1543
01:19:17,580 --> 01:19:19,540
我完全效忠于他

1544
01:19:21,960 --> 01:19:24,790
You see, I can't tell if you're making a joke or if you're just...

1545
01:19:21,960 --> 01:19:24,790
你看我就是分不清你到底是开玩笑还是…

1546
01:19:26,450 --> 01:19:27,750
French.

1547
01:19:26,450 --> 01:19:27,750
法国人都这样

1548
01:19:33,640 --> 01:19:34,640
Oh.

1549
01:19:33,640 --> 01:19:34,640
噢

1550
01:19:37,730 --> 01:19:40,260
Hey, knock it off.

1551
01:19:37,730 --> 01:19:40,260
喂 别闹了

1552
01:19:47,490 --> 01:19:48,980
You stay right there.

1553
01:19:47,490 --> 01:19:48,980
你别过来

1554
01:19:49,570 --> 01:19:51,150
I know what you are.

1555
01:19:49,570 --> 01:19:51,150
我知道你是谁

1556
01:19:52,120 --> 01:19:53,230
Queenie.

1557
01:19:52,120 --> 01:19:53,230
奎妮

1558
01:19:55,080 --> 01:19:56,530
We are not here to hurt you.

1559
01:19:55,080 --> 01:19:56,530
我们不是来伤害你的

1560
01:19:57,620 --> 01:19:59,030
We only want to help you.

1561
01:19:57,620 --> 01:19:59,030
我们只想帮助你

1562
01:20:00,870 --> 01:20:03,710
You're so very, very far away from home.

1563
01:20:00,870 --> 01:20:03,710
你离家太远了

1564
01:20:04,340 --> 01:20:08,300
Far away from everything you love, everything that is comfortable.

1565
01:20:04,340 --> 01:20:08,300
远离一切你所深爱的事物 远离你的舒适圈

1566
01:20:10,840 --> 01:20:13,260
I would never see you harmed.

1567
01:20:10,840 --> 01:20:13,260
我不想看你受伤害

1568
01:20:14,100 --> 01:20:15,260
Ever.

1569
01:20:14,100 --> 01:20:15,260
永远不想

1570
01:20:16,970 --> 01:20:20,810
It is not your fault that your sister is an Auror.

1571
01:20:16,970 --> 01:20:20,810
你姐姐是一名傲罗并不是你的错

1572
01:20:22,860 --> 01:20:24,940
I wish you were working with me now

1573
01:20:22,860 --> 01:20:24,940
我希望你现在能与我同一阵线

1574
01:20:25,900 --> 01:20:25,940
towards a world where we wizards were free to live openly.

1575
01:20:25,940 --> 01:20:30,240
努力让世界能容许巫师光明正大的生活

1576
01:20:25,940 --> 01:20:30,240
towards a world where we wizards were free to live openly.

1577
01:20:32,400 --> 01:20:32,410
能择其所爱

1578
01:20:32,410 --> 01:20:34,020
To love freely.

1579
01:20:32,410 --> 01:20:34,020
能择其所爱

1580
01:20:46,170 --> 01:20:48,000
You are an innocent.

1581
01:20:46,170 --> 01:20:48,000
你从未伤害任何人

1582
01:20:50,380 --> 01:20:51,710
So go now.

1583
01:20:50,380 --> 01:20:51,710
你走吧

1584
01:20:53,670 --> 01:20:53,680
离开这地方

1585
01:20:53,680 --> 01:20:55,210
Leave this place.

1586
01:20:53,680 --> 01:20:55,210
离开这地方

1587
01:20:58,600 --> 01:21:00,600
删剪片段

1588
01:21:05,150 --> 01:21:06,150
原来你在这

1589
01:21:05,150 --> 01:21:06,150
There you are.

1590
01:21:06,270 --> 01:21:10,060
What did Travers want? Absolutely outrageous behavior.

1591
01:21:06,270 --> 01:21:10,060
特拉弗斯到底想干什么? 他的行为太过分了

1592
01:21:10,190 --> 01:21:11,560
Marching into a school like that.

1593
01:21:10,190 --> 01:21:11,560
那样冲进一所学校

1594
01:21:11,650 --> 01:21:13,140
It was all very mundane,

1595
01:21:11,650 --> 01:21:13,140
那不算什么

1596
01:21:13,320 --> 01:21:13,370
I'm fine, sorry, Minerva, lot of marking.

1597
01:21:13,370 --> 01:21:15,610
不好意思 米勒娃 我还有很多作业要批改

1598
01:21:13,370 --> 01:21:15,610
I'm fine, sorry, Minerva, lot of marking.

1599
01:22:42,580 --> 01:22:46,740
Hey, uh, Newt, buddy. Uh...

1600
01:22:42,580 --> 01:22:46,740
嘿纽特 兄弟 额……

1601
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:49,040
Tina's up here. She's all by her lonesome,

1602
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:49,040
蒂娜在上面 她就孤单一人

1603
01:22:49,210 --> 01:22:51,670
and, uh, maybe you want to come up and keep her company?

1604
01:22:49,210 --> 01:22:51,670
所以你要不要上来陪陪她?

1605
01:22:52,710 --> 01:22:55,420
Uh, I've been looking for food, and I ain't found any,

1606
01:22:52,710 --> 01:22:55,420
我四处找食物可一直都没找到

1607
01:22:57,010 --> 01:22:59,000
so I guess I'm gonna go upstairs and try my luck

1608
01:22:57,010 --> 01:22:59,000
所以我觉得我要上楼碰碰运气

1609
01:22:59,180 --> 01:23:01,540
in, oh, I don't know, the attic.

1610
01:22:59,180 --> 01:23:01,540
或许阁楼也得看看

1611
01:23:03,020 --> 01:23:04,350
You're all right.

1612
01:23:03,020 --> 01:23:04,350
你会没事的

1613
01:23:04,520 --> 01:23:05,760
Relashio.

1614
01:23:04,520 --> 01:23:05,760
力劲松懈

1615
01:23:11,860 --> 01:23:12,860
Okay.

1616
01:23:11,860 --> 01:23:12,860
好吧

1617
01:23:25,700 --> 01:23:27,440
She's responded well to the Dittany.

1618
01:23:25,700 --> 01:23:27,440
它对白鲜的反应很好

1619
01:23:28,920 --> 01:23:30,410
She was born to run, you see.

1620
01:23:28,920 --> 01:23:30,410
它天生就爱乱跑

1621
01:23:31,080 --> 01:23:33,620
But I think she's...She's just lacking in confidence.

1622
01:23:31,080 --> 01:23:33,620
但我想它只是有点缺乏自信

1623
01:23:34,920 --> 01:23:36,820
Mr. Scamander, have you got anything in your case

1624
01:23:34,920 --> 01:23:36,820
斯卡曼德先生 你皮箱里有东西

1625
01:23:36,820 --> 01:23:36,840
斯卡曼德先生 你皮箱里有东西

1626
01:23:36,840 --> 01:23:39,000
that might help revive this man?

1627
01:23:36,840 --> 01:23:39,000
能叫醒这个人吗

1628
01:23:39,090 --> 01:23:40,250
I need to question him.

1629
01:23:39,090 --> 01:23:40,250
我得盘问他

1630
01:23:40,340 --> 01:23:42,820
I think he knows who Credence really is. And the scars on his hand

1631
01:23:40,340 --> 01:23:42,820
我想他知道克雷登斯的真实身份 而他手上的伤疤

1632
01:23:42,820 --> 01:23:45,060
- suggest an Unbreakable Vow. - An Unbreakable Vow.

1633
01:23:42,820 --> 01:23:45,060
-代表他曾立下牢不可破咒 -牢不可破咒

1634
01:23:45,060 --> 01:23:46,550
Yeah, I noticed that, too.

1635
01:23:45,060 --> 01:23:46,550
我也注意到了

1636
01:23:58,400 --> 01:23:59,400
Lumos.

1637
01:23:58,400 --> 01:23:59,400
荧光闪烁

1638
01:24:06,660 --> 01:24:07,990
What was that?

1639
01:24:06,660 --> 01:24:07,990
那是什么?

1640
01:24:08,160 --> 01:24:09,990
There must be a Water Dragon in that sewer.

1641
01:24:08,160 --> 01:24:09,990
那个下水道里一定有水龙

1642
01:24:11,450 --> 01:24:11,460
它们身上常常有这种寄生虫 你看 它们…

1643
01:24:11,460 --> 01:24:13,950
They carry these parasites, you see. They, um...

1644
01:24:11,460 --> 01:24:13,950
它们身上常常有这种寄生虫 你看 它们…

1645
01:24:14,750 --> 01:24:16,620
- Jacob. - Yeah?

1646
01:24:14,750 --> 01:24:16,620
-雅各布 -咋了

1647
01:24:18,090 --> 01:24:21,300
In my case, in the pocket there, you'll find a pair of tweezers.

1648
01:24:18,090 --> 01:24:21,300
在我皮箱的夹层中，有一支镊子

1649
01:24:21,720 --> 01:24:22,720
Tweezers?

1650
01:24:21,720 --> 01:24:22,720
镊子?

1651
01:24:23,470 --> 01:24:25,370
-就是细细尖尖… -尖尖的工具

1652
01:24:23,470 --> 01:24:25,370
- They're thin, pointy... - Little pointy things.

1653
01:24:25,390 --> 01:24:26,910
Yes, I know what tweezers are.

1654
01:24:25,390 --> 01:24:26,910
我知道镊子是什么

1655
01:24:29,640 --> 01:24:29,650
All right. You might not want to watch this.

1656
01:24:29,650 --> 01:24:31,360
你应该不会想看这个场面的

1657
01:24:29,650 --> 01:24:31,360
All right. You might not want to watch this.

1658
01:24:32,150 --> 01:24:33,390
I can handle it.

1659
01:24:32,150 --> 01:24:33,390
我没问题

1660
01:24:38,360 --> 01:24:39,360
Come out.

1661
01:24:38,360 --> 01:24:39,360
出来吧

1662
01:24:39,530 --> 01:24:42,140
Come on. You're all right.

1663
01:24:39,530 --> 01:24:42,140
来吧 你没事

1664
01:24:42,660 --> 01:24:45,240
- Ew. - Come on. I got you.

1665
01:24:42,660 --> 01:24:45,240
来啊 我拉住了

1666
01:24:46,240 --> 01:24:47,550
Jacob, will you take that for me?

1667
01:24:46,240 --> 01:24:47,550
雅各布 能帮我拿着吗

1668
01:24:51,870 --> 01:24:52,870
Calamari.

1669
01:24:51,870 --> 01:24:52,870
透抽

1670
01:24:52,870 --> 01:24:52,880
透抽

1671
01:24:55,590 --> 01:24:57,500
Must kill him.

1672
01:24:55,590 --> 01:24:57,500
一定要杀了他

1673
01:24:57,670 --> 01:24:59,000
Who?

1674
01:24:57,670 --> 01:24:59,000
谁

1675
01:24:59,090 --> 01:25:00,200
Credence?

1676
01:24:59,090 --> 01:25:00,200
克雷登斯?

1677
01:25:01,590 --> 01:25:03,360
It may take him a few hours to recover.

1678
01:25:01,590 --> 01:25:03,360
可能要几小时才会恢复

1679
01:25:03,390 --> 01:25:05,380
That parasite's poison is quite strong.

1680
01:25:03,390 --> 01:25:05,380
那寄生虫的毒性颇强

1681
01:25:07,130 --> 01:25:07,140
我必须回魔法部去汇报进度

1682
01:25:07,140 --> 01:25:09,260
I have to go back to the Ministry with what I've got.

1683
01:25:07,140 --> 01:25:09,260
我必须回魔法部去汇报进度

1684
01:25:11,440 --> 01:25:13,000
It's nice to see you again, Mr. Scamander.

1685
01:25:11,440 --> 01:25:13,000
很高兴再次见到你 斯卡曼德先生

1686
01:25:13,100 --> 01:25:15,190
Hey. Hey . Hold on a second, will ya?

1687
01:25:13,100 --> 01:25:15,190
唉唉 稍等一下 好吗

1688
01:25:15,270 --> 01:25:17,010
Hold on. Hold on.

1689
01:25:15,270 --> 01:25:17,010
稍等 等一下

1690
01:25:17,110 --> 01:25:19,190
Wait! Tina.

1691
01:25:17,110 --> 01:25:19,190
别走蒂娜

1692
01:25:23,660 --> 01:25:25,320
You didn't mention salamanders, did you?

1693
01:25:23,660 --> 01:25:25,320
你没提火蜥蜴吧?

1694
01:25:25,490 --> 01:25:28,070
我没有 她就这样走了 我不懂

1695
01:25:25,490 --> 01:25:28,070
No, I didn't. She just ran. I don't know...

1696
01:25:28,990 --> 01:25:30,780
So you chase after her.

1697
01:25:28,990 --> 01:25:30,780
你要去追啊

1698
01:25:31,900 --> 01:25:31,910
蒂娜 拜托你听我说

1699
01:25:31,910 --> 01:25:34,530
Tina. Please, just listen to me.

1700
01:25:31,910 --> 01:25:34,530
蒂娜 拜托你听我说

1701
01:25:35,160 --> 01:25:35,170
斯卡曼德 我得去跟魔法部汇报

1702
01:25:35,170 --> 01:25:38,200
Mr. Scamander, I need to go talk to the Ministry.

1703
01:25:35,170 --> 01:25:38,200
斯卡曼德 我得去跟魔法部汇报

1704
01:25:38,490 --> 01:25:38,500
我知道你对于傲罗的看法

1705
01:25:38,500 --> 01:25:40,240
I know how you feel about Aurors.

1706
01:25:38,500 --> 01:25:40,240
我知道你对于傲罗的看法

1707
01:25:40,510 --> 01:25:41,790
I may have been a little strong

1708
01:25:40,510 --> 01:25:41,790
我在那些信里的言辞可能有一些过激

1709
01:25:41,790 --> 01:25:41,880
我在那些信里的言辞可能有一些过激

1710
01:25:41,880 --> 01:25:43,440
in the way that I expressed myself in that letter.

1711
01:25:41,880 --> 01:25:43,440
我在那些信里的言辞可能有一些过激

1712
01:25:43,470 --> 01:25:46,630
What was the exact phrase? "A bunch of careerist hypocrites"?

1713
01:25:43,470 --> 01:25:46,630
你用的是什么词来着? 一群虚伪又野心勃勃的人

1714
01:25:46,850 --> 01:25:48,200
I'm sorry, but I can't admire people

1715
01:25:46,850 --> 01:25:48,200
很抱歉 我不欣赏那些

1716
01:25:48,220 --> 01:25:51,340
whose answer to everything that they fear or misunderstand is "kill it."

1717
01:25:48,220 --> 01:25:51,340
对于一切不了解或者恐惧的东西就起了杀心的人

1718
01:25:51,520 --> 01:25:52,930
I'm an Auror and I don't.

1719
01:25:51,520 --> 01:25:52,930
我就是一名傲罗 然而我并不是那样的人

1720
01:25:53,100 --> 01:25:55,140
Yes, I know. That's because you've gone middle head.

1721
01:25:53,100 --> 01:25:55,140
是的 因为你是中间那个头

1722
01:25:56,900 --> 01:25:57,900
Excuse me?

1723
01:25:56,900 --> 01:25:57,900
你说什么?

1724
01:25:58,690 --> 01:26:01,040
It's an expression derived from the three heads of the Runespoor.

1725
01:25:58,690 --> 01:26:01,040
这个措辞来自如尼纹蛇的三个头

1726
01:26:01,070 --> 01:26:02,470
So the middle one is the visionary.

1727
01:26:01,070 --> 01:26:02,470
中间那个头最有远见

1728
01:26:02,610 --> 01:26:04,930
Now, every Auror in Europe wants Credence dead, except you.

1729
01:26:02,610 --> 01:26:04,930
除你以外整个欧洲的傲罗都想要格雷登斯死

1730
01:26:05,070 --> 01:26:06,280
You've gone middle head.

1731
01:26:05,070 --> 01:26:06,280
所以你是中间那个头

1732
01:26:07,910 --> 01:26:10,650
Who else uses that expression, Mr. Scamander?

1733
01:26:07,910 --> 01:26:10,650
还有谁会用这种表述吗 斯卡曼德先生

1734
01:26:12,160 --> 01:26:13,620
I think it might just be me.

1735
01:26:12,160 --> 01:26:13,620
大概只有我会用吧

1736
01:26:32,050 --> 01:26:32,060
是格林德沃 他在召集他的追随者

1737
01:26:32,060 --> 01:26:35,050
It's Grindelwald. He's calling his followers.

1738
01:26:32,060 --> 01:26:35,050
是格林德沃 他在召集他的追随者

1739
01:27:03,170 --> 01:27:06,290
It's too late. Grindelwald has come for Credence.

1740
01:27:03,170 --> 01:27:06,290
太迟了 格林德沃是冲着格雷登斯来的

1741
01:27:08,260 --> 01:27:10,920
- He might already have him. - It's not too late.

1742
01:27:08,260 --> 01:27:10,920
-搞不好已经找到他了 -还不算迟

1743
01:27:11,010 --> 01:27:12,590
We can still get to him first.

1744
01:27:11,010 --> 01:27:12,590
我们还是能先找到他

1745
01:27:15,050 --> 01:27:15,060
你要去哪

1746
01:27:15,060 --> 01:27:16,140
Where are you going?

1747
01:27:15,060 --> 01:27:16,140
你要去哪

1748
01:27:16,600 --> 01:27:18,090
The French Ministry of Magic.

1749
01:27:16,600 --> 01:27:18,090
法国魔法部

1750
01:27:18,270 --> 01:27:20,180
That's the last place Credence would go.

1751
01:27:18,270 --> 01:27:20,180
克雷登斯最不可能去那里了

1752
01:27:20,350 --> 01:27:20,360
魔法部里藏有一个盒子

1753
01:27:20,360 --> 01:27:22,520
There's a box hidden in the Ministry, Tina.

1754
01:27:20,360 --> 01:27:22,520
魔法部里藏有一个盒子

1755
01:27:23,280 --> 01:27:25,280
It's a box that can tell us who Credence really is.

1756
01:27:23,280 --> 01:27:25,280
它能告诉我们克雷登斯的真实身份

1757
01:27:25,440 --> 01:27:27,690
A box? What are you talking about?

1758
01:27:25,440 --> 01:27:27,690
盒子? 你在讲什么?

1759
01:27:27,950 --> 01:27:28,950
Trust me.

1760
01:27:27,950 --> 01:27:28,950
相信我

1761
01:27:32,610 --> 01:27:32,620
你想出来吗? 就一小会儿

1762
01:27:32,620 --> 01:27:34,780
You wanna come out, just for a little while?

1763
01:27:32,620 --> 01:27:34,780
你想出来吗? 就一小会儿

1764
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:36,410
You can be free.

1765
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:36,410
可以自由走动

1766
01:27:45,210 --> 01:27:46,210
Credence.

1767
01:27:45,210 --> 01:27:46,210
克雷登斯

1768
01:27:54,770 --> 01:27:55,770
What do you want?

1769
01:27:54,770 --> 01:27:55,770
你想要什么?

1770
01:27:55,850 --> 01:27:56,850
From you?

1771
01:27:55,850 --> 01:27:56,850
从你身上?

1772
01:27:58,270 --> 01:27:59,270
Nothing.

1773
01:27:58,270 --> 01:27:59,270
什么也不要

1774
01:28:02,180 --> 01:28:02,190
我能给你什么?

1775
01:28:02,190 --> 01:28:03,270
For you?

1776
01:28:02,190 --> 01:28:03,270
我能给你什么?

1777
01:28:05,320 --> 01:28:07,150
Everything I never had.

1778
01:28:05,320 --> 01:28:07,150
我未曾拥有的一切

1779
01:28:08,360 --> 01:28:11,440
But what is it you want, my boy?

1780
01:28:08,360 --> 01:28:11,440
但你又想要什么 孩子?

1781
01:28:12,370 --> 01:28:14,110
I want to know who I am.

1782
01:28:12,370 --> 01:28:14,110
我想知道我究竟是谁

1783
01:28:23,540 --> 01:28:28,630
This is where you will find proof of your true identity.

1784
01:28:23,540 --> 01:28:28,630
你会在这里找到你真实身份的证据

1785
01:28:33,550 --> 01:28:38,090
Come to Père Lachaise tonight, and you will discover the truth.

1786
01:28:33,550 --> 01:28:38,090
今晚到拉雪兹神父公墓 你会知道事实

1787
01:28:55,450 --> 01:28:57,440
Father, why did you make me...

1788
01:28:55,450 --> 01:28:57,440
父亲 你为何要逼我

1789
01:29:00,160 --> 01:29:01,160
等等

1790
01:29:00,160 --> 01:29:01,160
Wait...

1791
01:29:02,920 --> 01:29:04,330
Wait.

1792
01:29:02,920 --> 01:29:04,330
等等

1793
01:29:25,770 --> 01:29:28,390
我恐怕这屋子里没什么吃的

1794
01:29:25,770 --> 01:29:28,390
I'm afraid we keep no food in the house.

1795
01:29:30,490 --> 01:29:31,940
Are you a ghost?

1796
01:29:30,490 --> 01:29:31,940
你是鬼吗?

1797
01:29:32,110 --> 01:29:33,190
No.

1798
01:29:32,110 --> 01:29:33,190
不

1799
01:29:33,990 --> 01:29:36,230
No. I'm alive.

1800
01:29:33,990 --> 01:29:36,230
不 我是活人

1801
01:29:37,370 --> 01:29:40,230
But I'm an alchemist and therefore immortal.

1802
01:29:37,370 --> 01:29:40,230
但我是炼金术士 所以长生不老

1803
01:29:42,080 --> 01:29:44,200
You don't look a day over 375.

1804
01:29:42,080 --> 01:29:44,200
你看起来绝对不超过375岁

1805
01:29:47,660 --> 01:29:47,670
很抱歉我们没有敲门

1806
01:29:47,670 --> 01:29:49,280
I'm sorry that we didn't knock.

1807
01:29:47,670 --> 01:29:49,280
很抱歉我们没有敲门

1808
01:29:49,460 --> 01:29:51,290
No. No matter.

1809
01:29:49,460 --> 01:29:51,290
不 没关系

1810
01:29:51,460 --> 01:29:53,710
Albus told me some friends might be dropping in.

1811
01:29:51,460 --> 01:29:53,710
阿不思有跟我说会有朋友造访

1812
01:29:54,760 --> 01:29:56,220
Nicolas Flamel.

1813
01:29:54,760 --> 01:29:56,220
我是尼可•勒梅

1814
01:30:00,100 --> 01:30:01,180
Jacob Kowalski.

1815
01:30:00,100 --> 01:30:01,180
我是雅各布·科沃斯基

1816
01:30:03,940 --> 01:30:04,970
I'm sorry.

1817
01:30:03,940 --> 01:30:04,970
对不起

1818
01:30:05,060 --> 01:30:06,060
It's all right.

1819
01:30:05,060 --> 01:30:06,060
没关系

1820
01:30:06,150 --> 01:30:08,560
- I didn't... - Oh... Oh!

1821
01:30:06,150 --> 01:30:08,560
-我不是… -哦 哦

1822
01:30:19,990 --> 01:30:21,980
At last, we see some development.

1823
01:30:19,990 --> 01:30:21,980
终于有些动静了

1824
01:30:22,080 --> 01:30:24,570
Yeah. I've seen one of these before.

1825
01:30:22,080 --> 01:30:24,570
对 我以前看过这个东西

1826
01:30:24,660 --> 01:30:26,780
It was at the fair.

1827
01:30:24,660 --> 01:30:26,780
是在园游会

1828
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:28,640
有个戴面纱的女人

1829
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:28,640
There was this dame there, and she had a veil,

1830
01:30:28,670 --> 01:30:31,960
and I gave her a nickel, and she told me about my future.

1831
01:30:28,670 --> 01:30:31,960
我给她五分钱 然后她预言我的未来

1832
01:30:32,590 --> 01:30:35,500
And she missed out on quite a bit, actually.

1833
01:30:32,590 --> 01:30:35,500
其实她漏掉好多东西

1834
01:30:42,020 --> 01:30:44,350
Wait a minute, I know him. That's the kid. That's Credence.

1835
01:30:42,020 --> 01:30:44,350
等等 我认识他 是克雷登斯那小子

1836
01:30:47,140 --> 01:30:47,150
老天

1837
01:30:47,150 --> 01:30:48,150
Jeez.

1838
01:30:47,150 --> 01:30:48,150
老天

1839
01:30:49,860 --> 01:30:51,310
Hey... Hey!

1840
01:30:49,860 --> 01:30:51,310
嘿

1841
01:30:52,650 --> 01:30:55,110
That's Queenie. There she is. Hi, baby.

1842
01:30:52,650 --> 01:30:55,110
那是奎妮 她在那儿 嗨 宝贝

1843
01:30:55,610 --> 01:30:57,770
Where is this? Is this here?

1844
01:30:55,610 --> 01:30:57,770
这是哪 是不是在这附近?

1845
01:30:57,860 --> 01:31:00,320
Yes. This is the Lestrange tomb.

1846
01:30:57,860 --> 01:31:00,320
是的 这是莱斯特兰奇家族的墓

1847
01:31:00,490 --> 01:31:02,980
It lies in the cemetery of Père Lachaise.

1848
01:31:00,490 --> 01:31:02,980
坐落在拉雪兹神父公墓内

1849
01:31:04,280 --> 01:31:04,290
我来了 宝贝 别走开

1850
01:31:04,290 --> 01:31:05,990
I'm coming, baby. Stay right there.

1851
01:31:04,290 --> 01:31:05,990
我来了 宝贝 别走开

1852
01:31:06,150 --> 01:31:06,160
谢谢你 勒梅先生

1853
01:31:06,160 --> 01:31:07,400
Thank you, Mr. Flamel.

1854
01:31:06,160 --> 01:31:07,400
谢谢你 勒梅先生

1855
01:31:07,580 --> 01:31:11,120
- Ouch. - I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Okay.

1856
01:31:07,580 --> 01:31:11,120
-啊！-哦 对不起 对不起 好吧

1857
01:31:11,290 --> 01:31:14,290
Oh, look after Mr. Tentacles for me. Oh, no.

1858
01:31:11,290 --> 01:31:14,290
帮我顾一下章鱼哥 哦不

1859
01:31:14,460 --> 01:31:15,460
I'm sorry. I gotta go.

1860
01:31:14,460 --> 01:31:15,460
抱歉 我得走了

1861
01:31:15,550 --> 01:31:17,430
Please, you mustn't go to the cemetery.

1862
01:31:15,550 --> 01:31:17,430
请你千万不能去公墓

1863
01:31:40,450 --> 01:31:41,650
What's happening?

1864
01:31:40,450 --> 01:31:41,650
发生什么事了?

1865
01:31:41,830 --> 01:31:43,510
Exactly what he said would happen.

1866
01:31:41,830 --> 01:31:43,510
完全照他说的发生了

1867
01:31:44,740 --> 01:31:46,990
Grindelwald rallies at the cemetery tonight,

1868
01:31:44,740 --> 01:31:46,990
格林德沃今晚会在公墓集会

1869
01:31:47,080 --> 01:31:48,490
and there will be death.

1870
01:31:47,080 --> 01:31:48,490
肯定会有伤亡

1871
01:31:48,670 --> 01:31:49,750
Then you gotta go.

1872
01:31:48,670 --> 01:31:49,750
那你得过去

1873
01:31:49,830 --> 01:31:52,540
What? I haven't seen action in 200 years.

1874
01:31:49,830 --> 01:31:52,540
什么 我已经两百年没动过手了

1875
01:31:52,710 --> 01:31:55,500
Flamel, you can do this. We believe in you.

1876
01:31:52,710 --> 01:31:55,500
勒梅 你必须得去 我们对你有信心

1877
01:32:04,810 --> 01:32:06,970
The box is in the Ancestral Records room, Tina.

1878
01:32:04,810 --> 01:32:06,970
盒子在族谱档案室里 蒂娜

1879
01:32:07,140 --> 01:32:08,550
So it's three floors down.

1880
01:32:07,140 --> 01:32:08,550
所以 应该在地下三楼

1881
01:32:08,640 --> 01:32:09,680
Is that Polyjuice?

1882
01:32:08,640 --> 01:32:09,680
那是复方汤剂吗

1883
01:32:09,850 --> 01:32:11,560
It's just enough to get me inside.

1884
01:32:09,850 --> 01:32:11,560
这些只够我混进去

1885
01:32:20,610 --> 01:32:22,320
- Who... - It's my brother, Theseus.

1886
01:32:20,610 --> 01:32:22,320
-是谁... -我哥哥 忒修斯

1887
01:32:22,860 --> 01:32:22,870
他是个傲罗 还很爱抱人

1888
01:32:22,870 --> 01:32:25,650
He's an Auror and a hugger.

1889
01:32:22,870 --> 01:32:25,650
他是个傲罗 还很爱抱人

1890
01:32:27,870 --> 01:32:29,030
What's happening?

1891
01:32:27,870 --> 01:32:29,030
怎么了

1892
01:32:29,210 --> 01:32:30,240
Grindelwald's rallying.

1893
01:32:29,210 --> 01:32:30,240
格林德沃要举行集会

1894
01:32:30,330 --> 01:32:32,170
We don't know where, but we think it's tonight.

1895
01:32:30,330 --> 01:32:32,170
地点不知道 但估计是今晚

1896
01:32:36,670 --> 01:32:38,290
- Be careful. - Of course.

1897
01:32:36,670 --> 01:32:38,290
-小心点 -当然

1898
01:32:38,470 --> 01:32:41,070
- Promise me you'll be careful. - Of course. I'm gonna be careful.

1899
01:32:38,470 --> 01:32:41,070
-答应我要你一定要小心 -我当然会小心的

1900
01:32:41,840 --> 01:32:43,710
Listen, I want you to hear this from me.

1901
01:32:41,840 --> 01:32:43,710
听好 我希望是由我告诉你

1902
01:32:43,890 --> 01:32:45,950
They think that Credence boy might be your missing brother.

1903
01:32:43,890 --> 01:32:45,950
他们认为克雷登斯 可能是你失踪的弟弟

1904
01:32:45,970 --> 01:32:47,510
- My brother is dead. - I know.

1905
01:32:45,970 --> 01:32:47,510
-我弟弟已经死了 -我知道

1906
01:32:47,680 --> 01:32:49,010
- He died. - I know.

1907
01:32:47,680 --> 01:32:49,010
-他死了 -我知道

1908
01:32:49,180 --> 01:32:51,800
- How many times, Theseus? - And the records will prove that.

1909
01:32:49,180 --> 01:32:51,800
-这话还要说几次 忒修斯? -档案会证明一切

1910
01:32:52,480 --> 01:32:55,810
- Okay? They can't lie. - Theseus.

1911
01:32:52,480 --> 01:32:55,810
-好吗 档案不会说谎 -忒修斯

1912
01:33:01,530 --> 01:33:04,360
I want every person at that rally arrested. If they resist...

1913
01:33:01,530 --> 01:33:04,360
我要你逮捕参与集会的每一人 若反抗…

1914
01:33:04,360 --> 01:33:04,370
我要你逮捕参与集会的每一人 若反抗…

1915
01:33:04,530 --> 01:33:05,890
Sir, forgive me, but if we go in too heavy,

1916
01:33:04,530 --> 01:33:05,890
长官 如果我们逼得太紧

1917
01:33:05,910 --> 01:33:08,120
- don't we run the risk of adding to... - Just do it.

1918
01:33:05,910 --> 01:33:08,120
-不就助长了… -照做就行了

1919
01:33:25,970 --> 01:33:28,570
我猜你无法在法国魔法部内幻影移形吧?

1920
01:33:25,970 --> 01:33:28,570
I don't suppose you can Disapparate on Ministry premises in France, can you?

1921
01:33:28,600 --> 01:33:29,600
Nope.

1922
01:33:28,600 --> 01:33:29,600
不行

1923
01:33:30,060 --> 01:33:31,890
Pity.

1924
01:33:30,060 --> 01:33:31,890
真可惜

1925
01:33:32,970 --> 01:33:32,980
-纽特 -是 我知道 我知道

1926
01:33:32,980 --> 01:33:35,060
- Newt! - Yes, I know. I know it's...

1927
01:33:32,980 --> 01:33:35,060
-纽特 -是 我知道 我知道

1928
01:33:39,730 --> 01:33:40,730
Newt!

1929
01:33:39,730 --> 01:33:40,730
纽特

1930
01:33:42,240 --> 01:33:43,240
Newt!

1931
01:33:42,240 --> 01:33:43,240
纽特

1932
01:33:43,450 --> 01:33:44,980
- Oh! - That's your brother?

1933
01:33:43,450 --> 01:33:44,980
那个是你哥哥?

1934
01:33:45,070 --> 01:33:46,680
So I think I may have mentioned in my letters

1935
01:33:45,070 --> 01:33:46,680
我想我在信中提过

1936
01:33:46,700 --> 01:33:47,840
that we have quite a complicated relationship.

1937
01:33:46,700 --> 01:33:47,840
我们俩的关系很复杂

1938
01:33:47,870 --> 01:33:49,150
Newt, stop!

1939
01:33:47,870 --> 01:33:49,150
纽特 停下来

1940
01:33:49,330 --> 01:33:50,850
- Does he wanna kill you? - Frequently.

1941
01:33:49,330 --> 01:33:50,850
-他想杀你吗? -经常

1942
01:33:51,750 --> 01:33:52,830
Enough!

1943
01:33:51,750 --> 01:33:52,830
别跑了

1944
01:33:59,710 --> 01:34:01,330
他需要控制他的脾气

1945
01:33:59,710 --> 01:34:01,330
He needs to control his temper.

1946
01:34:06,500 --> 01:34:06,510
我觉得这可能是我此生最棒的时刻

1947
01:34:06,510 --> 01:34:08,750
I think that might have been the best moment of my life.

1948
01:34:06,510 --> 01:34:08,750
我觉得这可能是我此生最棒的时刻

1949
01:34:53,470 --> 01:34:54,470
Queenie.

1950
01:34:53,470 --> 01:34:54,470
奎妮

1951
01:34:59,520 --> 01:35:00,760
Queenie, honey.

1952
01:34:59,520 --> 01:35:00,760
奎妮 甜心

1953
01:35:03,780 --> 01:35:06,360
Don't. Don't move.

1954
01:35:03,780 --> 01:35:06,360
别 别动

1955
01:35:15,320 --> 01:35:16,240
有何贵干?

1956
01:35:16,750 --> 01:35:18,610
Yes, this is Leta Lestrange.

1957
01:35:16,750 --> 01:35:18,610

1992
01:36:22,690 --> 01:36:25,600
抱歉 我想说的是 我希望你开心

1993
01:36:25,690 --> 01:36:28,560
but I don't want you to be happy that I'm happy, because I'm not.

1994
01:36:25,690 --> 01:36:28,560
但我不想你因为我开心而开心 因为我没有…

01:36:41,250 --> 01:36:42,860
我是伴郎

2005
01:36:43,750 --> 01:36:45,660
which is sort of mildly hilarious.

2006
01:36:43,750 --> 01:36:45,660
说起来有点可笑

2007
01:36:46,800 --> 01:36:48,880
Does he think you're here to win her back?

2008
01:36:46,800 --> 01:36:48,880
他认为你是来横刀夺爱的吗

2009
01:36:51,880 --> 01:36:53,290
Are you here to win her back?

2010
01:36:51,880 --> 01:36:53,290

2028
01:37:14,870 --> 01:37:14,900

我把这剪下

2031
01:37:22,870 --> 01:37:25,660
It's just a picture of you from the paper,

2032
01:37:22,870 --> 01:37:25,660
就是报纸上面你的照片

2033
01:37:26,330 --> 01:37:26,340
很有趣 因为在报纸上你的眼睛…

2034
01:37:26,340 --> 01:37:29,000
but it's interesting 'cause your eyes in newsprint...

2035
01:37:26,340 --> 01:37:29,000
很有趣 因为在报纸上你的眼睛…

2036
01:37:31,260 --> 01:37:34,500
See, in reality they have this effect in them, Tina. It's like...

2037
01:37:31,260 --> 01:37:34,500
看你本人时 你眼睛里有种光辉 就像...

2038
01:37:35,170 --> 01:37:35,180
像是黑水中燃烧的火焰

2039
01:37:35,180 --> 01:37:37,890
It's like fire in water, in dark water.

2040
01:37:35,180 --> 01:37:37,890
像是黑水中燃烧的火焰

2041
01:37:41,430 --> 01:37:43,430
And I've only ever seen that...

2042
01:37:41,430 --> 01:37:43,430
我只曾在动物身上见过

2043
01:37:46,060 --> 01:37:48,520
I've only ever seen that in...

2044
01:37:46,060 --> 01:37:48,520
我只曾在动物身上见过 那就是…

2045
01:37:52,730 --> 01:37:52,740
火蜥蜴

2046
01:37:52,740 --> 01:37:54,150
Salamanders.

2047
01:37:52,740 --> 01:37:54,150
火蜥蜴

2048
01:37:58,660 --> 01:37:59,660
Come.

来

2050
01:38:05,500 --> 01:38:06,500
Lestrange.

2051
01:38:05,500 --> 01:38:06,500
莱斯特兰奇

2052
01:38:51,300 --> 01:38:55,430
资料移至拉雪兹神父公墓内的 莱斯特兰奇家族陵墓

2053
01:39:10,110 --> 01:39:11,350
Circumrota.

2054
01:39:10,110 --> 01:39:11,350
即刻旋转

2055
01:39:22,410 --> 01:39:23,490
Hello, Newt.

2056
01:39:22,410 --> 01:39:23,490

Hello, Leta.

2058
01:39:28,120 --> 01:39:29,240
你好 莉塔

2059
01:39:33,550 --> 01:39:34,550
Hi.

2060
01:39:33,550 --> 01:39:34,550
嗨

2061
01:39:37,800 --> 01:39:38,920
Oh, no.

2062
01:39:37,800 --> 01:39:38,920
哦不

2063
01:39:44,220 --> 01:39:45,680
What kind of cats are those?

2064
01:39:44,220 --> 01:39:45,680
那是什么猫？

2065
01:39:45,850 --> 01:39:47,010
Uh, these aren't cats.

2066
01:39:45,850 --> 01:39:47,010
那些不是猫

2067
01:39:47,060 --> 01:39:49,300
They're Matagots. They're spirit familiars.

2068
01:39:47,060 --> 01:39:49,300
是玛达戈猫 一种灵性生物

2069
01:39:49,400 --> 01:39:51,140
它们守卫魔法部

2070
01:39:49,400 --> 01:39:51,140
They guard the Ministry.

2071
01:39:51,360 --> 01:39:52,840
But they won't hurt you unless you...

2072
01:39:51,360 --> 01:39:52,840
它们不会伤人 除非…

2073
01:39:52,980 --> 01:39:54,310
昏昏倒地

2074
01:39:52,980 --> 01:39:54,310
Stupefy!

2075
01:39:55,530 --> 01:39:56,560
Unless you attack them.

2076
01:39:55,530 --> 01:39:56,560
除非你先攻击它们

2077
01:39:57,400 --> 01:39:58,400
Oops.

2078
01:39:57,400 --> 01:39:58,400

2079
01:39:58,780 --> 01:40:00,390

2085
01:41:33,870 --> 01:41:36,790
Okay. Wait. Hold it there, please.

2086
01:41:33,870 --> 01:41:36,790
等等 别闹了等一下 拜托

2087
01:41:38,250 --> 01:41:39,410
Come on.

2088
01:41:38,250 --> 01:41:39,410
别这样

2089
01:41:42,130 --> 01:41:43,290
All right.

2090
01:41:42,130 --> 01:41:43,290
好了

2091
01:41:46,930 --> 01:41:48,210
Okay, wait.

01:41:46,930 --> 01:41:48,210
好了 等等

2093
01:42:02,400 --> 01:42:04,820
You, go back. Move! Out of the way!

2094
01:42:02,400 --> 01:42:04,820
你，退后，快点，快让开

2095
01:42:06,530 --> 01:42:08,740
If I must kill you as well as Corvus, I shall.

2096
01:42:06,530 --> 01:42:08,740
若杀考乌斯也得杀了你 我会动手

2097
01:42:09,950 --> 01:42:10,950
Stop!

2098
01:42:09,950 --> 01:42:10,950
住手

2099
01:42:15,420 --> 01:42:16,420
Yusuf.

2100
01:42:15,420 --> 01:42:16,420
尤瑟夫

2101
01:42:17,910 --> 01:42:17,920
真的是你吗

2102
01:42:17,920 --> 01:42:19,530
Is that really you?

2103
01:42:17,920 --> 01:42:19,530
真的是你吗

2104
01:42:25,580 --> 01:42:25,590
我的妹妹?

2105
01:42:25,590 --> 01:42:27,330
My little sister?

2106
01:42:25,590 --> 01:42:27,330
我的妹妹?

2107
01:42:29,800 --> 01:42:29,810
所以他是你哥哥

2108
01:42:29,810 --> 01:42:31,720
So he's your brother.

2109
01:42:29,810 --> 01:42:31,720
所以他是你哥哥

2110
01:42:33,520 --> 01:42:35,010

我是谁?

2112
01:42:36,100 --> 01:42:37,100
I don't know.

2113
01:42:36,100 --> 01:42:37,100
我不知道

2114
01:42:37,270 --> 01:42:39,810
I'm tired of living with no name and no history.

2115
01:42:37,270 --> 01:42:39,810
我厌倦了无名无过往的人生

2116
01:42:42,780 --> 01:42:45,360
Just tell me my story, then you can end it.

- No, Yusuf.

2123
01:42:52,620 --> 01:42:54,040
不 尤瑟夫

2124
01:43:10,510 --> 01:43:13,050
My father was Mustafa Kama.

2125
01:43:10,510 --> 01:43:13,050
我父亲穆斯塔法·卡玛

2126
01:43:13,640 --> 01:43:17,130
Pure-blood of Senegalese descent and most accomplished.

2127
01:43:13,640 --> 01:43:17,130
是塞内加尔裔最知名的纯血巫师

2128
01:43:18,440 --> 01:43:20,140
My mother, Laurena,

2129
01:43:18,440 --> 01:43:20,140
我母亲劳瑞娜

2130
01:43:21,610 --> 01:43:24,350
was equally highbred, a noted beauty.

2131
01:43:21,610 --> 01:43:24,350
同样是出身名门的著名美女

2132
01:43:25,900 --> 01:43:27,140
They were deeply in love.

2133
01:43:25,900 --> 01:43:27,140
他们深爱彼此

2134
01:43:29,240 --> 01:43:33,400
They knew a man of great influence from a famous French pure-blood family.

2135
01:43:29,240 --> 01:43:33,400
他俩认识一名出身法国纯血望族的男人

2136
01:43:35,580 --> 01:43:37,120
He desired her.

2137
01:43:35,580 --> 01:43:37,120
他贪恋她的美色

2138
01:43:37,710 --> 01:43:40,540
Maman. Maman!

2139
01:43:37,710 --> 01:43:40,540
(法语)妈妈

2140
01:43:41,210 --> 01:43:46,130
Lestrange used the Imperius Curse to seduce and abduct her.

2141
01:43:41,210 --> 01:43:46,130
莱斯特兰奇用夺魂咒勾引并绑架她

2142
01:43:47,470 --> 01:43:50,050
I tried to prevent it, but he attacked me.

2143
01:43:47,470 --> 01:43:50,050
我试着阻止 但他攻击了我

2144
01:43:51,800 --> 01:43:53,720
That was the last time I ever saw her.

2145
01:43:51,800 --> 01:43:53,720
那是我最后一次看到她

2146
01:43:56,350 --> 01:43:59,640
She died giving birth to a little girl.

2147
01:43:56,350 --> 01:43:59,640
她生下一名女婴 难产而死

2148
01:44:01,270 --> 01:44:02,430
You.

2149
01:44:01,270 --> 01:44:02,430
就是你

2150
01:44:05,820 --> 01:44:09,900
The news of her death drove my father insane.

2151
01:44:05,820 --> 01:44:09,900
她的死讯把我父亲逼疯

2152
01:44:10,700 --> 01:44:12,190
With his dying breath,

2153
01:44:10,700 --> 01:44:12,190
在咽下最后一口气前

2154
01:44:13,160 --> 01:44:16,870
my father charged me to seek revenge.

2155
01:44:13,160 --> 01:44:16,870
我父亲要我为他复仇

2156
01:44:18,960 --> 01:44:21,410
Kill the person Lestrange loves best in the world.

2157
01:44:18,960 --> 01:44:21,410
杀死莱斯特兰奇世上最爱的人

2158
01:44:22,590 --> 01:44:24,620
I thought at first it'd be easy.

2159
01:44:22,590 --> 01:44:24,620
我一开始以为很容易

2160
01:44:25,590 --> 01:44:27,450
He had only one close relative.

2161
01:44:25,590 --> 01:44:27,450
他只有一个近亲

2162
01:44:28,590 --> 01:44:29,800
You.

2163
01:44:28,590 --> 01:44:29,800
就是你

2164
01:44:29,970 --> 01:44:31,050
But he...

2165
01:44:29,970 --> 01:44:31,050
但是他…

2166
01:44:31,510 --> 01:44:32,720
Say it.

2167
01:44:31,510 --> 01:44:32,720
说吧

2168
01:44:33,640 --> 01:44:35,250
He never loved you.

2169
01:44:33,640 --> 01:44:35,250
他从没爱过你

2170
01:44:39,480 --> 01:44:42,440
He remarried, and not three months after her death.

2171
01:44:39,480 --> 01:44:42,440
她死后不足三个月 他就再婚了

2172
01:44:46,280 --> 01:44:48,440
He loved her no more than he had loved you.

2173
01:44:46,280 --> 01:44:48,440
他既不爱她 也不爱你

2174
01:44:52,490 --> 01:44:56,980
But then his son, Corvus, was born at last.

2175
01:44:52,490 --> 01:44:56,980
但他的儿子考乌斯随后出生

2176
01:44:57,160 --> 01:45:01,830
And that man who had never known love was filled with it.

2177
01:44:57,160 --> 01:45:01,830
那个从不知爱为何物的人 突然充满父爱

2178
01:45:02,370 --> 01:45:04,210
All he cared about

2179
01:45:02,370 --> 01:45:04,210
他唯一在乎的

2180
01:45:04,790 --> 01:45:06,330
was little Corvus.

2181
01:45:04,790 --> 01:45:06,330
只有小考乌斯

2182
01:45:09,840 --> 01:45:11,550
So this is the truth?

2183
01:45:09,840 --> 01:45:11,550
所以是真的?

2184
01:45:12,970 --> 01:45:14,800
I am Corvus Lestrange?

2185
01:45:12,970 --> 01:45:14,800
我是考乌斯·莱斯特兰奇?

2186
01:45:14,970 --> 01:45:16,800
- Yes. Yes. - No. No.

2187
01:45:14,970 --> 01:45:16,800
-对 -不对

2188
01:45:16,970 --> 01:45:20,390
Realizing that Mustafa Kama's son had sworn revenge,

2189
01:45:16,970 --> 01:45:20,390
知道穆斯塔法·卡玛之子 立誓报仇后

2190
01:45:20,480 --> 01:45:23,140
你父亲要把你藏在我找不到的地方

2191
01:45:20,480 --> 01:45:23,140
your father sought to hide you where I couldn't find you.

2192
01:45:24,150 --> 01:45:28,440
So he confided you to his servant, who boarded a ship for America.

2193
01:45:24,150 --> 01:45:28,440
他将你托付给仆人 搭船前往美国

2194
01:45:28,610 --> 01:45:31,650
- He did send Corvus to America, but... - His servant, Irma Dugard,

2195
01:45:28,610 --> 01:45:31,650
-他的确送考乌斯去美国 但… -他的仆人伊尔玛·杜加尔德

2196
01:45:32,280 --> 01:45:33,610
was a half-elf.

2197
01:45:32,280 --> 01:45:33,610
是个混血精灵

2198
01:45:34,160 --> 01:45:35,490
Her magic was weak,

2199
01:45:34,160 --> 01:45:35,490
她的法力太弱

2200
01:45:35,660 --> 01:45:37,740
and therefore left no trace I could follow.

2201
01:45:35,660 --> 01:45:37,740
留下的踪迹让我无法追踪

2202
01:45:40,080 --> 01:45:43,200
I had only just discovered how you had escaped

2203
01:45:40,080 --> 01:45:43,200
我终于发现你如何逃脱时

2204
01:45:43,370 --> 01:45:45,580
when I received news I never expected.

2205
01:45:43,370 --> 01:45:45,580
我收到出乎意料外的消息

2206
01:45:46,090 --> 01:45:48,750
The ship had gone down at sea.

2207
01:45:46,090 --> 01:45:48,750
船在大海中沉没了

2208
01:45:49,370 --> 01:45:49,380
但你幸存下来了 不是吗?

2209
01:45:49,380 --> 01:45:51,000
But you survived, didn't you?

2210
01:45:49,380 --> 01:45:51,000
但你幸存下来了 不是吗?

2211
01:45:52,260 --> 01:45:55,250
Somehow, someone had pulled you from the water.

2212
01:45:52,260 --> 01:45:55,250
总之 有人将你从水中拉上来

2213
01:45:56,430 --> 01:45:58,920
"A son cruelly banished Despair of the daughter

2214
01:45:56,430 --> 01:45:58,920
“被残忍放逐之子 伤心且绝望之女”

2215
01:45:59,100 --> 01:46:01,810
Return, great avenger, With wings from the water."

2216
01:45:59,100 --> 01:46:01,810
“伟大复仇者的回归 从水中携带着羽翼”

2217
01:46:02,270 --> 01:46:04,630
There stands the despairing daughter.

2218
01:46:02,270 --> 01:46:04,630
那里站着伤心且绝望之女

2219
01:46:04,810 --> 01:46:08,230
You are the winged raven, returned from the sea,

2220
01:46:04,810 --> 01:46:08,230
你是长着羽翼的渡鸦从海中回归 而我…

2221
01:46:08,860 --> 01:46:12,610
but I'm the avenger of my family's ruin.

2222
01:46:08,860 --> 01:46:12,610
我 我是身负灭门血仇的复仇者

2223
01:46:15,110 --> 01:46:16,730
I pity you, Corvus.

2224
01:46:15,110 --> 01:46:16,730
我同情你 考乌斯

2225
01:46:18,700 --> 01:46:20,110
But you must die.

2226
01:46:18,700 --> 01:46:20,110
但你非死不可

2227
01:46:20,290 --> 01:46:23,200
Corvus Lestrange is already dead! I killed him!

2228
01:46:20,290 --> 01:46:23,200
考乌斯·莱斯特兰奇早就死了 是我杀了他

2229
01:46:29,670 --> 01:46:30,670
Accio!

2230
01:46:29,670 --> 01:46:30,670
速速飞来

2231
01:46:48,650 --> 01:46:51,730
My father owned a very strange family tree.

2232
01:46:48,650 --> 01:46:51,730
我父亲家有着非常奇妙的族谱

2233
01:46:55,360 --> 01:46:57,100
It only recorded the men.

2234
01:46:55,360 --> 01:46:57,100
上面只记录男性

2235
01:47:01,620 --> 01:47:03,860
The women in my family were recorded as flowers.

2236
01:47:01,620 --> 01:47:03,860
家族的女性以花朵代表

2237
01:47:05,170 --> 01:47:06,920
考乌斯·莱斯特兰奇

2238
01:47:07,160 --> 01:47:07,170
美丽

2239
01:47:07,170 --> 01:47:08,330
Beautiful.

2240
01:47:07,170 --> 01:47:08,330
美丽

2241
01:47:10,580 --> 01:47:10,590
孤立

2242
01:47:10,590 --> 01:47:11,750
Separate.

2243
01:47:10,590 --> 01:47:11,750
孤立

2244
01:47:14,420 --> 01:47:16,460
My father sent me to America with Corvus.

2245
01:47:14,420 --> 01:47:16,460
我父亲把我和考乌斯一起送往美国

2246
01:47:22,680 --> 01:47:25,390
Irma was to pose as a grandmother with two grandchildren.

2247
01:47:22,680 --> 01:47:25,390
伊尔玛假扮带着孙子们旅行的奶奶

2248
01:47:31,150 --> 01:47:33,230
Corvus never stopped crying.

2249
01:47:31,150 --> 01:47:33,230
考乌斯总是哭个不停

2250
01:47:37,820 --> 01:47:39,110
Do you have any news?

2251
01:47:37,820 --> 01:47:39,110
有任何消息吗?

2252
01:47:39,280 --> 01:47:40,900
All hands to station!

2253
01:47:39,280 --> 01:47:40,900
所有人员回工作岗位

2254
01:47:41,700 --> 01:47:43,530
Run to station!

2255
01:47:41,700 --> 01:47:43,530
立刻返回岗位

2256
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:54,240
I never wanted to hurt him.

2257
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:54,240
我从没想过伤害他

2258
01:47:59,510 --> 01:48:01,380
I only wanted to be free of him.

2259
01:47:59,510 --> 01:48:01,380
我只是想要摆脱他

2260
01:48:02,180 --> 01:48:03,590
Just for a moment.

2261
01:48:02,180 --> 01:48:03,590
哪怕只是一下

2262
01:48:09,060 --> 01:48:11,100
Just a single moment.

2263
01:48:09,060 --> 01:48:11,100
一下下就好

2264
01:48:16,490 --> 01:48:17,980
Give him to me.

2265
01:48:16,490 --> 01:48:17,980
把他给我

2266
01:48:19,030 --> 01:48:20,640
Everyone, to the lifeboats!

2267
01:48:19,030 --> 01:48:20,640
各位 前往救生船

2268
01:48:20,740 --> 01:48:22,530
They want us to put on life jackets.

2269
01:48:20,740 --> 01:48:22,530
他们叫大家穿救生衣

2270
01:49:22,130 --> 01:49:24,050
You didn't mean to do it, Leta.

2271
01:49:22,130 --> 01:49:24,050
你不是故意的 莉塔

2272
01:49:26,430 --> 01:49:28,170
So it wasn't your fault.

2273
01:49:26,430 --> 01:49:28,170
所以不是你的错

2274
01:49:30,770 --> 01:49:32,130
Oh, Newt.

2275
01:49:30,770 --> 01:49:32,130
不 纽特

2276
01:49:36,650 --> 01:49:38,760
You never met a monster you couldn't love.

2277
01:49:36,650 --> 01:49:38,760
你总能在怪物身上发现可爱之处

2278
01:49:43,780 --> 01:49:44,780
Leta...

2279
01:49:43,780 --> 01:49:44,780
莉塔

2280
01:49:45,870 --> 01:49:47,780
Do you know who Credence really is?

2281
01:49:45,870 --> 01:49:47,780
你知道克雷登斯的真实身分吗

2282
01:49:49,370 --> 01:49:51,740
Did you know when you swapped them?

2283
01:49:49,370 --> 01:49:51,740
在你调包的时候

2284
01:49:51,830 --> 01:49:52,950
No.

2285
01:49:51,830 --> 01:49:52,950
不知道

2286
01:50:16,020 --> 01:50:17,100
Queenie?

2287
01:50:16,020 --> 01:50:17,100
奎妮

2288
01:50:44,590 --> 01:50:45,920
They're pure-bloods.

2289
01:50:44,590 --> 01:50:45,920
他们是纯血巫师

2290
01:50:46,260 --> 01:50:47,800
They kill the likes of us for sport.

2291
01:50:46,260 --> 01:50:47,800
专门以杀我们这种人为乐

2292
01:50:50,470 --> 01:50:50,510
奎妮

2293
01:50:50,510 --> 01:50:51,550
Queenie?

2294
01:50:50,510 --> 01:50:51,550
奎妮

2295
01:50:51,640 --> 01:50:53,350
Jacob!

2296
01:50:51,640 --> 01:50:53,350
雅各布

2297
01:50:53,430 --> 01:50:55,260
Honey, you're here! Hi!

2298
01:50:53,430 --> 01:50:55,260
甜心 你来了 嗨

2299
01:50:55,440 --> 01:50:56,720
Hi, hon. Hi.

2300
01:50:55,440 --> 01:50:56,720
嗨 甜心

2301
01:50:57,310 --> 01:50:59,220
Oh, honey, I'm so sorry.

2302
01:50:57,310 --> 01:50:59,220
甜心 我真抱歉

2303
01:50:59,400 --> 01:51:01,510
I never should have done it. I love you so much.

2304
01:50:59,400 --> 01:51:01,510
我不该一走了之 我好爱你

2305
01:51:01,690 --> 01:51:03,600
And you know that I love you, right?

2306
01:51:01,690 --> 01:51:03,600
你也知道我爱你 对吧?

2307
01:51:03,780 --> 01:51:04,530
- Yeah. - Good. Let's get the hell outta here.

2308
01:51:03,780 --> 01:51:04,530
对

2309
01:51:04,530 --> 01:51:04,610
- Yeah. - Good. Let's get the hell outta here.

2310
01:51:04,610 --> 01:51:05,860
很好 那我们闪人吧

2311
01:51:04,610 --> 01:51:05,860
- Yeah. - Good. Let's get the hell outta here.

2312
01:51:06,030 --> 01:51:07,820
Oh, no, wait a second.

2313
01:51:06,030 --> 01:51:07,820
不 等等 等一下

2314
01:51:10,030 --> 01:51:13,530
I just thought maybe we could hear him first.

2315
01:51:10,030 --> 01:51:13,530
我想先听听他要说什么

2316
01:51:13,620 --> 01:51:15,740
Just listen. That's all.

2317
01:51:13,620 --> 01:51:15,740
听听就好 如此而已

2318
01:51:16,870 --> 01:51:18,110
What are you talking about?

2319
01:51:16,870 --> 01:51:18,110
你在讲什么?

2320
01:51:23,460 --> 01:51:24,620
It's a trap.

2321
01:51:23,460 --> 01:51:24,620
这是陷阱

2322
01:51:25,130 --> 01:51:26,130
Yeah.

2323
01:51:25,130 --> 01:51:26,130
对

2324
01:51:27,630 --> 01:51:30,800
Queenie, the family tree. It's all been bait.

2325
01:51:27,630 --> 01:51:30,800
奎妮 族谱 只为了引我们入陷阱

2326
01:51:32,430 --> 01:51:34,510
We have to find a way out of here right now.

2327
01:51:32,430 --> 01:51:34,510
我们得快想办法立刻离开

2328
01:51:36,390 --> 01:51:37,720
You go find the others.

2329
01:51:36,390 --> 01:51:37,720
你去找其他人

2330
01:51:37,810 --> 01:51:39,100
你呢?

2331
01:51:37,810 --> 01:51:39,100
What are you gonna do?

2332
01:51:39,770 --> 01:51:41,260
I'll think of something.

2333
01:51:39,770 --> 01:51:41,260
我会见招拆招的

2334
01:52:29,660 --> 01:52:32,990
My brothers, my sisters,

2335
01:52:29,660 --> 01:52:32,990
兄弟们 姐妹们

2336
01:52:34,580 --> 01:52:35,690
my friends,

2337
01:52:34,580 --> 01:52:35,690
朋友们

2338
01:52:36,660 --> 01:52:40,500
the great gift of your applause is not for me. No.

2339
01:52:36,660 --> 01:52:40,500
你们热烈的掌声不该献给我

2340
01:52:41,500 --> 01:52:43,740
It is for yourselves.

2341
01:52:41,500 --> 01:52:43,740
而该献给自己

2342
01:52:46,260 --> 01:52:48,290
You came today because of a craving

2343
01:52:46,260 --> 01:52:48,290
你们来此是因为心里向往

2344
01:52:50,590 --> 01:52:52,000
and a knowledge

2345
01:52:50,590 --> 01:52:52,000
并深切了解

2346
01:52:53,720 --> 01:52:56,680
that the old ways serve us no longer.

2347
01:52:53,720 --> 01:52:56,680
墨守陈规对我们已不再管用

2348
01:52:59,810 --> 01:53:03,640
You came today because you crave something new.

2349
01:52:59,810 --> 01:53:03,640
你们来此是因为渴望新的东西

2350
01:53:05,520 --> 01:53:06,760
Something different.

2351
01:53:05,520 --> 01:53:06,760
不同的局面

2352
01:53:09,530 --> 01:53:10,860
It is said

2353
01:53:09,530 --> 01:53:10,860
很多人说

2354
01:53:11,320 --> 01:53:14,690
that I hate les non-Magiques.

2355
01:53:11,320 --> 01:53:14,690
我痛恨不懂魔法之人

2356
01:53:15,830 --> 01:53:17,070
The Muggles.

2357
01:53:15,830 --> 01:53:17,070
麻瓜们

2358
01:53:17,240 --> 01:53:19,080
- Vermin! - The No-Maj.

2359
01:53:17,240 --> 01:53:19,080
-害虫 -麻鸡

2360
01:53:20,210 --> 01:53:21,790
The Can't-Spells.

2361
01:53:20,210 --> 01:53:21,790
不施咒语者

2362
01:53:23,660 --> 01:53:23,670
我不恨他们

2363
01:53:23,670 --> 01:53:25,370
I do not hate them.

2364
01:53:23,670 --> 01:53:25,370
我不恨他们

2365
01:53:26,300 --> 01:53:27,630
I do not.

2366
01:53:26,300 --> 01:53:27,630
完全不恨

2367
01:53:29,340 --> 01:53:31,460
For I do not fight out of hatred.

2368
01:53:29,340 --> 01:53:31,460
因为我不是为仇恨而战

2369
01:53:34,050 --> 01:53:37,640
I say the Muggles are not lesser,

2370
01:53:34,050 --> 01:53:37,640
我认为麻瓜并不是更低级

2371
01:53:38,640 --> 01:53:39,930
but other.

2372
01:53:38,640 --> 01:53:39,930
而是属性不同

2373
01:53:40,890 --> 01:53:42,220
Not worthless,

2374
01:53:40,890 --> 01:53:42,220
并非一文不值

2375
01:53:43,810 --> 01:53:45,470
but of other value.

2376
01:53:43,810 --> 01:53:45,470
而是价值不同

2377
01:53:46,690 --> 01:53:50,850
Not disposable, but of a different disposition.

2378
01:53:46,690 --> 01:53:50,850
不是不堪大用 而是别有用途

2379
01:53:52,110 --> 01:53:54,100
Magic blooms

2380
01:53:52,110 --> 01:53:54,100
魔法天赋

2381
01:53:56,200 --> 01:53:59,190
only in rare souls.

2382
01:53:56,200 --> 01:53:59,190
只在少数人身上绽放

2383
01:54:01,250 --> 01:54:05,330
It is granted to those who live for higher things.

2384
01:54:01,250 --> 01:54:05,330
只降临在对生命 有着更高追求者的身上

2385
01:54:06,340 --> 01:54:09,670
Oh, and what a world we would make for all of humanity.

2386
01:54:06,340 --> 01:54:09,670
若将世界交给我们统治 必能嘉惠全人类

2387
01:54:09,840 --> 01:54:12,550
We who live for freedom,

2388
01:54:09,840 --> 01:54:12,550
因我们全然为自由

2389
01:54:14,130 --> 01:54:15,290
for truth,

2390
01:54:14,130 --> 01:54:15,290
为真理

2391
01:54:17,930 --> 01:54:19,170
and for love.

2392
01:54:17,930 --> 01:54:19,170
为爱而生

2393
01:54:29,520 --> 01:54:31,260
It isn't illegal to listen to him.

2394
01:54:29,520 --> 01:54:31,260
听他演说又不犯法

2395
01:54:32,400 --> 01:54:34,020
Use minimum force on the crowd.

2396
01:54:32,400 --> 01:54:34,020
对群众要慎用武力

2397
01:54:35,780 --> 01:54:37,400
We mustn't be what he says we are.

2398
01:54:35,780 --> 01:54:37,400
我们不能成为他口中的那种人

2399
01:54:43,330 --> 01:54:48,040
The moment has come to share my vision of the future

2400
01:54:43,330 --> 01:54:48,040
大限已到 该向大家展示我所预见的未来了

2401
01:54:49,830 --> 01:54:49,840
若不揭竿起义

2402
01:54:49,840 --> 01:54:53,120
that awaits if we do not rise up

2403
01:54:49,840 --> 01:54:53,120
若不揭竿起义

2404
01:54:54,880 --> 01:54:59,920
and take our rightful place in the world.

2405
01:54:54,880 --> 01:54:59,920
若不顺应天命将是何等境地

2406
01:55:43,970 --> 01:55:45,640
Not another war.

2407
01:55:43,970 --> 01:55:45,640
不要再打仗了

2408
01:55:50,940 --> 01:55:54,650
That is what we are fighting.

2409
01:55:50,940 --> 01:55:54,650
这就是我们要对抗的

2410
01:55:55,990 --> 01:55:57,350
That is the enemy.

2411
01:55:55,990 --> 01:55:57,350
这就是敌人

2412
01:55:59,320 --> 01:56:00,560
Their arrogance.

2413
01:55:59,320 --> 01:56:00,560
他们的狂妄自大

2414
01:56:02,080 --> 01:56:03,780
Their power lust.

2415
01:56:02,080 --> 01:56:03,780
他们的渴求权力

2416
01:56:06,040 --> 01:56:07,450
Their barbarity.

2417
01:56:06,040 --> 01:56:07,450
他们的粗鄙残暴

2418
01:56:09,330 --> 01:56:13,120
在他们将枪杆转向我们前 还有多少时间?

2419
01:56:09,330 --> 01:56:13,120
How long will it take before they turn their weapons on us?

2420
01:56:15,550 --> 01:56:17,790
Do nothing when I speak of this.

2421
01:56:15,550 --> 01:56:17,790
大家听我说就好 不要轻举妄动

2422
01:56:18,970 --> 01:56:20,670
You must remain calm

2423
01:56:18,970 --> 01:56:20,670
你们务必保持冷静

2424
01:56:22,970 --> 01:56:24,760
and contain your emotions.

2425
01:56:22,970 --> 01:56:24,760
控制自己情绪

2426
01:56:29,270 --> 01:56:31,260
There are Aurors here among us.

2427
01:56:29,270 --> 01:56:31,260
我们之中混杂了傲罗

2428
01:56:41,820 --> 01:56:44,310
Come closer, brother wizards. Join us.

2429
01:56:41,820 --> 01:56:44,310
靠近点 巫师兄弟们 加入我们

2430
01:56:46,080 --> 01:56:47,240
Do nothing.

2431
01:56:46,080 --> 01:56:47,240
按兵不动

2432
01:56:48,500 --> 01:56:49,780
And no force.

2433
01:56:48,500 --> 01:56:49,780
不要动武

2434
01:57:05,510 --> 01:57:08,630
They have killed many of my followers.

2435
01:57:05,510 --> 01:57:08,630
他们杀死我许多追随者

2436
01:57:09,430 --> 01:57:10,590
It is true.

2437
01:57:09,430 --> 01:57:10,590
那是事实

2438
01:57:11,850 --> 01:57:16,060
They confined me and tortured me in New York.

2439
01:57:11,850 --> 01:57:16,060
他们在纽约拘禁我 折磨我

2440
01:57:17,600 --> 01:57:17,610
他们滥杀女巫及巫师同胞

2441
01:57:17,610 --> 01:57:21,480
They had struck down their fellow witches and wizards.

2442
01:57:17,610 --> 01:57:21,480
他们滥杀女巫及巫师同胞

2443
01:57:23,110 --> 01:57:27,530
For the simple crime of seeking the truth.

2444
01:57:23,110 --> 01:57:27,530
只因他们犯下追求真理的罪

2445
01:57:29,290 --> 01:57:31,070
For wanting freedom.

2446
01:57:29,290 --> 01:57:31,070
只因渴求自由

2447
01:57:35,790 --> 01:57:39,330
Your anger, your desire for revenge is natural.

2448
01:57:35,790 --> 01:57:39,330
你们的愤怒和复仇的渴望 是正常的

2449
01:57:43,260 --> 01:57:44,260
No!

2450
01:57:43,260 --> 01:57:44,260
不

2451
01:58:15,290 --> 01:58:18,880
Take this young warrior back to her family.

2452
01:58:15,290 --> 01:58:18,880
将这名年轻勇士的遗体 交还给她家人

2453
01:58:27,050 --> 01:58:28,210
Disapparate.

2454
01:58:27,050 --> 01:58:28,210
幻影移形吧

2455
01:58:28,890 --> 01:58:30,000
Leave.

2456
01:58:28,890 --> 01:58:30,000
都走吧

2457
01:58:31,060 --> 01:58:34,050
Go forth from this place and spread the word.

2458
01:58:31,060 --> 01:58:34,050
离开后记得传话出去

2459
01:58:35,400 --> 01:58:38,600
It is not we who are violent.

2460
01:58:35,400 --> 01:58:38,600
滥用暴力的人不是我们

2461
01:58:38,600 --> 01:58:38,610
滥用暴力的人不是我们

2462
01:58:56,750 --> 01:58:57,960
Let's take him.

2463
01:58:56,750 --> 01:58:57,960
我们拿下他

2464
01:59:27,070 --> 01:59:30,860
Aurors, join me in this circle.

2465
01:59:27,070 --> 01:59:30,860
傲罗们 走进来加入我的行列

2466
01:59:32,700 --> 01:59:34,110
Pledge to me

2467
01:59:32,700 --> 01:59:34,110
宣告你的忠诚

2468
01:59:35,370 --> 01:59:36,910
your eternal allegiance,

2469
01:59:35,370 --> 01:59:36,910
顺我者昌

2470
01:59:37,830 --> 01:59:38,910
or die.

2471
01:59:37,830 --> 01:59:38,910
逆我者亡

2472
01:59:39,580 --> 01:59:41,450
Only here shall you know freedom.

2473
01:59:39,580 --> 01:59:41,450
唯有在这里才能享有自由

2474
01:59:42,050 --> 01:59:44,580
Only here shall you know yourself.

2475
01:59:42,050 --> 01:59:44,580
唯有在这里才能了解真我

2476
01:59:47,880 --> 01:59:50,500
Move! Run! Run!

2477
01:59:47,880 --> 01:59:50,500
闪开！ 快跑！

2478
01:59:51,720 --> 01:59:56,590
Play by the rules! No cheating, children.

2479
01:59:51,720 --> 01:59:56,590
要遵守游戏规则 不准作弊 孩子们

2480
02:00:01,400 --> 02:00:02,980
He knows who I am.

2481
02:00:01,400 --> 02:00:02,980
他知道我是谁

2482
02:00:03,150 --> 02:00:06,520
He knows what you were born, not who you are!

2483
02:00:03,150 --> 02:00:06,520
他知晓你的身世 但不了解你的为人

2484
02:00:06,610 --> 02:00:07,690
Credence!

2485
02:00:06,610 --> 02:00:07,690
克雷登斯

2486
02:00:22,880 --> 02:00:25,410
Queenie, honey. Queenie. You gotta wake up.

2487
02:00:22,880 --> 02:00:25,410
奎妮 甜心 你清醒点

2488
02:00:27,170 --> 02:00:28,250
Jacob.

2489
02:00:27,170 --> 02:00:28,250
雅各布

2490
02:00:29,090 --> 02:00:30,330
He's the answer.

2491
02:00:29,090 --> 02:00:30,330
他就是答案

2492
02:00:30,720 --> 02:00:31,750
He wants what we want.

2493
02:00:30,720 --> 02:00:31,750
我们与他目标一致

2494
02:00:31,930 --> 02:00:33,290
- No. - Yeah.

2495
02:00:31,930 --> 02:00:33,290
-不 -是的

2496
02:00:43,270 --> 02:00:46,230
This has all been for you, Credence.

2497
02:00:43,270 --> 02:00:46,230
这一切都是为了你 克雷登斯

2498
02:00:49,200 --> 02:00:50,610
Walk with me.

2499
02:00:49,200 --> 02:00:50,610
陪我一起去

2500
02:00:52,320 --> 02:00:54,030
Hon. No!

2501
02:00:52,320 --> 02:00:54,030
甜心 不

2502
02:00:54,200 --> 02:00:55,740
Walk with me!

2503
02:00:54,200 --> 02:00:55,740
陪我一起去

2504
02:00:57,750 --> 02:00:59,160
You're crazy.

2505
02:00:57,750 --> 02:00:59,160
你疯了

2506
02:01:01,580 --> 02:01:02,580
Queenie.

2507
02:01:01,580 --> 02:01:02,580
奎妮

2508
02:01:03,210 --> 02:01:04,210
No!

2509
02:01:03,210 --> 02:01:04,210
不

2510
02:01:04,380 --> 02:01:05,990
Queenie, don't do it!

2511
02:01:04,380 --> 02:01:05,990
奎妮 不要

2512
02:01:14,010 --> 02:01:15,010
Queenie.

2513
02:01:14,010 --> 02:01:15,010
奎妮

2514
02:01:17,680 --> 02:01:18,680
Queenie!

2515
02:01:17,680 --> 02:01:18,680
奎妮

2516
02:01:36,410 --> 02:01:37,900
Mr. Scamander.

2517
02:01:36,410 --> 02:01:37,900
斯卡曼德先生

2518
02:01:37,990 --> 02:01:42,160
Do you think Dumbledore will mourn for you?

2519
02:01:37,990 --> 02:01:42,160
你觉得邓布利多会为你哀悼吗

2520
02:01:52,430 --> 02:01:54,590
Grindelwald! Stop!

2521
02:01:52,430 --> 02:01:54,590
格林德沃 住手

2522
02:02:02,140 --> 02:02:03,140
Leta...

2523
02:02:02,140 --> 02:02:03,140
莉塔

2524
02:02:13,910 --> 02:02:16,190
This one I believe I know.

2525
02:02:13,910 --> 02:02:16,190
我想我认识你

2526
02:02:17,160 --> 02:02:18,900
Leta Lestrange.

2527
02:02:17,160 --> 02:02:18,900
莉塔·莱斯特兰奇

2528
02:02:20,080 --> 02:02:22,370
Despised entirely amongst wizards,

2529
02:02:20,080 --> 02:02:22,370
被全体巫师界仇视

2530
02:02:22,540 --> 02:02:25,540
unloved, mistreated,

2531
02:02:22,540 --> 02:02:25,540
无人疼爱 饱受霸凌

2532
02:02:27,130 --> 02:02:31,210
yet brave, so very brave.

2533
02:02:27,130 --> 02:02:31,210
但仍勇敢 非常勇敢

2534
02:02:36,340 --> 02:02:37,960
Time to come home.

2535
02:02:36,340 --> 02:02:37,960
是时候该回家了

2536
02:02:56,110 --> 02:02:57,350
I love you.

2537
02:02:56,110 --> 02:02:57,350
我爱你

2538
02:03:06,620 --> 02:03:07,700
Go!

2539
02:03:06,620 --> 02:03:07,700
快走

2540
02:03:08,710 --> 02:03:09,710
Go!

2541
02:03:08,710 --> 02:03:09,710
快走

2542
02:03:33,530 --> 02:03:35,190
I hate Paris.

2543
02:03:33,530 --> 02:03:35,190
我讨厌巴黎

2544
02:04:15,070 --> 02:04:17,730
Together, in a circle. Your wand into the earth.

2545
02:04:15,070 --> 02:04:17,730
大家一起围成圆形 魔杖遁地

2546
02:04:18,910 --> 02:04:21,110
Or all Paris will be destroyed.

2547
02:04:18,910 --> 02:04:21,110
否则巴黎将毁于一旦

2548
02:04:28,080 --> 02:04:29,570
Finite!

2549
02:04:28,080 --> 02:04:29,570
万咒皆终

2550
02:04:31,460 --> 02:04:32,460
Finite!

2551
02:04:31,460 --> 02:04:32,460
万咒皆终

2552
02:04:32,920 --> 02:04:33,920
Finite!

2553
02:04:32,920 --> 02:04:33,920
万咒皆终

2554
02:04:35,340 --> 02:04:36,340
Finite!

2555
02:04:35,340 --> 02:04:36,340
万咒皆终

2556
02:06:46,090 --> 02:06:47,930
I've chosen my side.

2557
02:06:46,090 --> 02:06:47,930
我早就选好一边站了

2558
02:07:09,150 --> 02:07:13,530
Come here. I've got you. I've got you.

2559
02:07:09,150 --> 02:07:13,530
过来 过来抱抱 过来抱抱

2560
02:07:58,420 --> 02:08:00,830
I think it's best if he speaks to him alone.

2561
02:07:58,420 --> 02:08:00,830
我想最好让他俩单独谈谈

2562
02:08:22,690 --> 02:08:25,990
奥地利 纽蒙迦德城堡

2563
02:08:34,990 --> 02:08:36,860
Is he frightened of me still?

2564
02:08:34,990 --> 02:08:36,860
他还是很怕我吗

2565
02:08:38,370 --> 02:08:40,030
You need to be careful.

2566
02:08:38,370 --> 02:08:40,030
讲话要小心

2567
02:08:41,040 --> 02:08:43,250
He's not sure he made the right choice.

2568
02:08:41,040 --> 02:08:43,250
他不确定自己的选择是否正确

2569
02:08:44,670 --> 02:08:47,660
Be very gentle with him.

2570
02:08:44,670 --> 02:08:47,660
要温柔地对待他

2571
02:08:53,180 --> 02:08:55,170
I have a gift for you, my boy.

2572
02:08:53,180 --> 02:08:55,170
我有礼物送给你 孩子

2573
02:09:07,610 --> 02:09:09,020
Is it true?

2574
02:09:07,610 --> 02:09:09,020
是真的吗

2575
02:09:09,990 --> 02:09:11,190
About Leta?

2576
02:09:09,990 --> 02:09:11,190
莉塔的事

2577
02:09:12,740 --> 02:09:13,740
Yes.

2578
02:09:12,740 --> 02:09:13,740
是

2579
02:09:16,490 --> 02:09:18,080
I'm so sorry.

2580
02:09:16,490 --> 02:09:18,080
太遗憾了

2581
02:09:24,750 --> 02:09:26,910
It's a blood pact, isn't it?

2582
02:09:24,750 --> 02:09:26,910
这是血盟 对吗?

2583
02:09:29,880 --> 02:09:31,960
You swore not to fight each other.

2584
02:09:29,880 --> 02:09:31,960
你俩立誓永不与对方为敌

2585
02:09:39,350 --> 02:09:42,640
How in the name of Merlin did you manage to get...

2586
02:09:39,350 --> 02:09:42,640
以梅林之名 你是怎么拿到…

2587
02:09:46,190 --> 02:09:50,600
Grindelwald doesn't seem to understand the nature of the things he considers simple.

2588
02:09:46,190 --> 02:09:50,600
格林德沃向来低估 他觉得不起眼的小东西

2589
02:10:06,710 --> 02:10:08,040
Can you destroy it?

2590
02:10:06,710 --> 02:10:08,040
有办法销毁吗

2591
02:10:08,200 --> 02:10:08,210
或许吧

2592
02:10:08,210 --> 02:10:09,450
Maybe.

2593
02:10:08,210 --> 02:10:09,450
或许吧

2594
02:10:11,580 --> 02:10:11,590
或许

2595
02:10:11,590 --> 02:10:12,830
Maybe.

2596
02:10:11,590 --> 02:10:12,830
或许

2597
02:10:19,020 --> 02:10:20,880
Would he like a cup of tea?

2598
02:10:19,020 --> 02:10:20,880
它会想要来杯茶吗

2599
02:10:21,890 --> 02:10:23,300
He'll have some milk.

2600
02:10:21,890 --> 02:10:23,300
它会想喝牛奶

2601
02:10:25,730 --> 02:10:27,470
Hide the teaspoons.

2602
02:10:25,730 --> 02:10:27,470
得把银汤匙藏好

2603
02:10:33,400 --> 02:10:38,270
You have suffered the most heinous of betrayals,

2604
02:10:33,400 --> 02:10:38,270
你多次遭遇最残忍的背叛

2605
02:10:39,490 --> 02:10:43,410
most purposely bestowed upon you by your own blood.

2606
02:10:39,490 --> 02:10:43,410
而且大多是由至亲手足

2607
02:10:43,500 --> 02:10:45,700
Your own flesh and blood.

2608
02:10:43,500 --> 02:10:45,700
跟你血脉相承的人刻意加注于你

2609
02:10:46,540 --> 02:10:49,450
And just as he has celebrated your torment,

2610
02:10:46,540 --> 02:10:49,450
如同他以你的痛苦为乐一般

2611
02:10:51,710 --> 02:10:55,550
your brother seeks to destroy you.

2612
02:10:51,710 --> 02:10:55,550
你的哥哥还想要赶尽杀绝

2613
02:11:16,520 --> 02:11:16,530
你家族传说，若是任何成员有难

2614
02:11:16,530 --> 02:11:20,150
There is a legend in your family that a phoenix will come to any member

2615
02:11:16,530 --> 02:11:20,150
你家族传说，若是任何成员有难

2616
02:11:20,370 --> 02:11:22,070
who is in dire need.

2617
02:11:20,370 --> 02:11:22,070
就会有凤凰来搭救

2618
02:11:29,590 --> 02:11:29,670
这是你与生俱来的权利 孩子

2619
