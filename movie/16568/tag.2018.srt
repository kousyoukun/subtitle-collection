that just doesn't happen.</i>

we figured out a way around that.</i>

playing a game,</i>

Look, Doctor Malloy,
I'm looking at your resume.

14
00:01:19,721 --> 00:01:21,769
It says you got a Ph.D.
in veterinary medicine

15
00:01:21,973 --> 00:01:24,647
and that you actually
have a successful practice right now.

16
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:28,906
Look, (SIGHS) there comes a time
in every man's life

17
00:01:29,064 --> 00:01:30,691
where you just gotta take stock,

18
00:01:30,857 --> 00:01:35,112
ask yourself what's really important,
what's on your bucket list.

19
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:37,622
So let me get this straight.

20
00:01:37,697 --> 00:01:41,827
On your bucket list, you don't have,
like, skydiving or rock climbing,

21
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:43,287
or tap dancing, maybe?

22
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:44,587
Dancing with wolves,

23
00:01:44,663 --> 00:01:46,040
I believe that has to be a thing.

24
00:01:46,122 --> 00:01:47,749
They wouldn't have made a movie
if it wasn't, you know?

25
00:01:47,833 --> 00:01:51,428
All I know is that, for me,
what I really want

26
00:01:51,586 --> 00:01:57,468
is to clean the urine off
of that man's toilet seat.

Anything I can do
to get closer to that guy, sign me up.

31
00:02:08,061 --> 00:02:09,187
Okay, look, man.

32
00:02:09,354 --> 00:02:10,901
Honestly, any other situation,

33
00:02:10,981 --> 00:02:13,200
I would just tell you
to get the fuck out my office, okay?

34
00:02:13,275 --> 00:02:16,950
But we do need the help,
so when can you start?

35
00:02:22,784 --> 00:02:24,582
I've already begun.

36
00:02:24,786 --> 00:02:25,833
What the fuck was that?

37
00:02:26,329 --> 00:02:27,922
- Uh...
- I haven't even opened that yet.

38
00:02:28,248 --> 00:02:30,922
Uh, I'm sorry.
I was trying to be proactive.

39
00:02:31,084 --> 00:02:33,382
Today. I can start today. Um...

40
00:02:35,005 --> 00:02:36,006
Why don't I get you another Coke?

We don't have to shake hands, man.

(LAUGHS WEAKLY) Mr. Callahan,
how do you respond to the idea

63
00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:34,068
that your industry
uses captive insurance

64
00:03:34,147 --> 00:03:35,569
to move risk off balance sheets?

65

Well, great question. Tough, but fair.

66
00:03:40,862 --> 00:03:45,618
Um, I guess I would say that
what I love about Freedom Atlantic

67
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:47,873
is that we're not like
other insurance companies.

and then hurt.

he'd be a sitting target.

What?

For the entire month of May,
every year, we play tag.

168
00:07:31,009 --> 00:07:32,010
Just like when we were kids.

169
00:07:32,093 --> 00:07:34,016
But we're not on a playground,
and we all live in different cities.

170
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:36,393
So you don't ever know
when someone's gonna pop up.

171
00:07:36,472 --> 00:07:37,724
You could be shopping at the mall,

172
00:07:37,807 --> 00:07:39,309
and then your buddy
jumps out of the trunk

173
00:07:39,392 --> 00:07:41,190
and, boom, tags you. You're it.

174

Here's the craziest part.

I was gonna introduce you to Rebecca,

for The Wall <i>Street</i> Journal.

Right? It's an interesting angle, right?

Probably has to be a story
for that to happen, right?

519

What do you mean,
there has to be a story?

Well, I mean, no Jerry, no story.

00:41:26,584 --> 00:41:28,632
I mean, Jerry's worse than all of you.

932
00:41:28,794 --> 00:41:30,387
He's very competitive.

933
00:41:30,546 --> 00:41:31,763
When we were kids, we had a contest

934
00:41:31,923 --> 00:41:34,426
to see who could hold their breath
for the longest underwater.

935
00:41:35,051 --> 00:41:36,598
He almost died.

936
00:41:36,677 --> 00:41:39,430
He won, but at what cost? Really?

937
00:41:39,513 --> 00:41:43,609
Oh, I hope he's this competitive
when it comes to being a father.

938
00:41:44,685 --> 00:41:45,686
Are you pregnant?

939
00:41:46,270 --> 00:41:48,398
- Really?
- Yeah, that's why the Shirley Temple.

940
00:41:48,564 --> 00:41:49,861
- Oh, my gosh!
- SUSAN: I know.

941
00:41:50,024 --> 00:41:51,321
- Here, cheers!
- Congratulations, that's great!

942
00:41:51,484 --> 00:41:52,610
- Cheers, thank you!
- Oh, my gosh!

943
00:41:52,777 --> 00:41:54,074
- That's such good news.
- Thank you. Yeah.

944
00:41:54,237 --> 00:41:56,114
- We're not telling that many people.
- Okay.

945
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:58,248
Listen, I know
it's gonna get a little wacky

946
00:41:58,407 --> 00:41:59,909
over the next couple of days
with you guys.

947
00:42:00,076 --> 00:42:01,749
- Sure the fuck is, yeah.
- SUSAN: Okay.

948
00:42:01,827 --> 00:42:04,330
(LAUGHING) Just don't go too far

949
00:42:04,413 --> 00:42:07,713
and go out there and play golf.
It's amazing. Do something fun.

950
00:42:07,792 --> 00:42:10,295
- Okay? Okay. Bye, guys.
- See you.

951
00:42:10,378 --> 00:42:12,756
I like her.
She has a beautiful personality.

952
00:42:12,922 --> 00:42:14,799
Very effervescent. Good energy.
Good vibes.

953
00:42:14,924 --> 00:42:16,392
Ah, don't believe a word
she fucking says.

954
00:42:16,550 --> 00:42:17,847
She's a hired hand. She's an actress.

955
00:42:18,052 --> 00:42:19,850
- What?
- I mean, look at this son of a bitch.

956
00:42:20,012 --> 00:42:21,889
- This is Colonel Sanders in the flesh.
- That's, like, her uncle.

957
00:42:22,056 --> 00:42:24,104
-It's the fucking <i>Truman</i> Show.
- Will you stop?

958
00:42:24,183 --> 00:42:26,527
The whole thing. Jerry set it up.
I guarantee it.

959
00:42:26,602 --> 00:42:28,354
Every single person here has been hired.

960
00:42:28,437 --> 00:42:29,814
You have gotta calm down.

961
00:42:29,897 --> 00:42:32,901
Hi. Nice to meet you. I'm his wife.

962
00:42:34,110 --> 00:42:36,329
Jerry, is that Cheryl Deakins?

963
00:42:42,159 --> 00:42:43,456
Oh, yeah. Good. Hey!

964
00:42:43,995 --> 00:42:45,167
- You invited her?
- Yeah, of course.

965
00:42:45,329 --> 00:42:46,330
What?

966
00:42:46,497 --> 00:42:48,215
What? We're all old friends.

967
00:42:48,874 --> 00:42:49,875
Makes sense.

968
00:42:50,042 --> 00:42:51,259
I'm not buying this.

969
00:42:54,463 --> 00:42:55,464
Is that, uh...

970
00:42:55,631 --> 00:42:57,258
BOB: Cheryl Deakins.

971
00:42:57,425 --> 00:42:58,472
CHILLI: You know she was coming, Bob?

972
00:42:58,801 --> 00:43:00,644
- I did not.
- I didn't either.

973
00:43:00,803 --> 00:43:01,804
She looks good.

974
00:43:01,971 --> 00:43:03,564
- Great. She always does.
- Yeah.

975
00:43:04,307 --> 00:43:05,559
CHILLll WOW!

976
00:43:05,725 --> 00:43:07,853
Uh, who is Cheryl Deakins?

977
00:43:08,019 --> 00:43:10,863
Is she like the Yoko or something?

978
00:43:11,022 --> 00:43:12,569
I don't get that reference,

979
00:43:12,732 --> 00:43:15,576
but she's someone whose presence
causes strain on our group.

980
00:43:16,110 --> 00:43:17,828
We've known her since grade school.

981
00:43:19,488 --> 00:43:22,833
<i>She was the first girl that Chilli
and Callahan had a crush on.</i>

982
00:43:23,451 --> 00:43:26,125
<i>When we were kids,
Cheryl was into Chilli,</i>

983
00:43:26,412 --> 00:43:28,915
<i>much to Callahan's chagrin.</i>

984
00:43:29,081 --> 00:43:31,300
<i>But young love is unpredictable.</i>

985
00:43:31,459 --> 00:43:34,429
<i>Later that same year, she decided
she was into Callahan,</i>

986
00:43:34,712 --> 00:43:37,010
<i>much to Chilli's chagrin.</i>

987
00:43:37,715 --> 00:43:40,935
<i>But she always had
a place in her heart for Chilli.</i>

988
00:43:49,352 --> 00:43:51,025
And this went on for decades.

989
00:43:51,187 --> 00:43:53,360
And all of a sudden,
she just married an orthodontist.

990
00:43:53,439 --> 00:43:54,440
Huh.

991
00:43:55,566 --> 00:43:56,818
They get all the chicks.

992
00:43:56,901 --> 00:43:57,902
What?

993
00:43:57,985 --> 00:43:59,453
How long has it been
since you've seen her?

994
00:43:59,612 --> 00:44:01,364
About 10 years for me. How about you?

995
00:44:01,989 --> 00:44:03,206
Same, I guess.

996
00:44:04,658 --> 00:44:06,126
- Been a while.
- CHILLI: Sure has.

997
00:44:06,202 --> 00:44:08,045
You sneaky trickster.

998
00:44:08,204 --> 00:44:11,003
She looks amazing, and you know it.
Think about this.

999
00:44:11,165 --> 00:44:14,544
What if Cheryl ended up getting back
together with our boy?

1000
00:44:14,710 --> 00:44:16,007
- Chilli?
- Callahan?

1001
00:44:16,170 --> 00:44:17,296
Obviously.

1002
00:44:17,380 --> 00:44:18,597
- Wait. What?
- Duh.

1003
00:44:18,756 --> 00:44:20,178
- Did you say Chilli?
- You're Team Callahan?

1004
00:44:20,341 --> 00:44:22,218
- Yeah!
- We've been married all this time,

1005
00:44:22,385 --> 00:44:23,728
and you think she should end up
with Callahan?

1006
00:44:23,886 --> 00:44:26,230
Of course. Wait, you think Chilli?

1007
00:44:26,389 --> 00:44:28,858
Wait, do you know those guys at all?

1008
00:44:29,141 --> 00:44:30,438
Who are you right now?

1009
00:44:30,518 --> 00:44:31,519
- What?
- You're freaking me out.

1010
00:44:31,602 --> 00:44:32,603
I feel like I don't even know you.

1011
00:44:32,728 --> 00:44:34,150
You're like this foreign person.

1012
00:44:36,774 --> 00:44:38,447
Do you want me to be a foreign person?

1013
00:44:38,984 --> 00:44:39,985
What?

1014
00:44:40,820 --> 00:44:42,197
Here? Right now?

1015
00:44:42,279 --> 00:44:43,701
Because, um...

1016
00:44:43,781 --> 00:44:45,829
(IN FRENCH ACCENT) I just got lost
on the way to bibliotheque,

1017
00:44:45,991 --> 00:44:48,210
and I don't know
where all my other French friends are.

1018
00:44:48,369 --> 00:44:49,416
Chantelle is here?

1019
00:44:49,578 --> 00:44:50,795
Chantelle is here with...

1020
00:44:50,955 --> 00:44:51,956
HOAGIE: Oh, my God!

1021
00:44:55,292 --> 00:44:57,044
(IN NORMAL ACCENT)
Honey, it's almost 5:00.

1022
00:44:57,878 --> 00:44:59,425
Keep your head in the game.

1023
00:44:59,588 --> 00:45:00,589
You're so good.

1024
00:45:00,756 --> 00:45:02,178
Come on, we'll go to the bathroom
for five minutes.

1025
00:45:02,341 --> 00:45:03,342
All right.

1026
00:45:03,509 --> 00:45:04,761
-It's crazy.
- Huh.

1027
00:45:04,927 --> 00:45:06,929
- Hey, you should go talk with her.
- No, you should go.

1028
00:45:07,096 --> 00:45:08,188
Neither of you should.

1029
00:45:08,889 --> 00:45:10,607
- BOB: Thanks.
- You're welcome. Neither one.

1030
00:45:10,850 --> 00:45:12,147
Shut up, Sable.

1031
00:45:12,226 --> 00:45:13,603
No, honestly, it should be you, Bob.

1032
00:45:13,769 --> 00:45:15,316
No, I think she really
wants to talk to you

1033
00:45:15,396 --> 00:45:18,320
'cause I think girls really like,
you know,

1034

depressed guys that still have a name
for their bong.

(INHALING)

1036
00:45:25,781 --> 00:45:26,953
Get a good one.

1037
00:45:29,535 --> 00:45:30,957
This is gonna go great.

1038
00:45:31,829 --> 00:45:32,921
- Thank you.
-(COUGHS)

1039
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:34,798
All right, good advice.

1040
00:45:36,417 --> 00:45:37,418
Good luck.

1041
00:45:38,794 --> 00:45:40,421
Tell her I said hi.

1042
00:45:44,758 --> 00:45:45,759
CHILLI: Cheryl Deakins.

1043
00:45:46,469 --> 00:45:47,937
Chilli Cilliano.

1044
00:45:48,262 --> 00:45:49,434
How'd you know it was me?

1045
00:45:49,597 --> 00:45:52,441
I'd know that faint smell of sativa
and Old Spice anywhere.

1046
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:54,352
Yeah. I had to get a little stoned.

1047
00:45:54,518 --> 00:45:56,441
I can't be sober at these things.
They're awful.

(CHERYL LAUGHS)

1049
00:45:57,605 --> 00:45:59,152
That was the wrong choice, man.

1050
00:45:59,523 --> 00:46:00,524
What?

1051
00:46:00,691 --> 00:46:04,696
Neither of you should have gone,
but if one of you should have went,

1052
00:46:04,862 --> 00:46:06,205
then it should have been you.

1053
00:46:06,572 --> 00:46:07,869
How many wines have you had?

1054
00:46:09,575 --> 00:46:12,078
How many legs does an octopus have?

1055
00:46:12,995 --> 00:46:14,042
Well, eight.

1056

(LAUGHS)

1057
00:46:16,832 --> 00:46:20,211
I see that you've been
rejecting fashion trends

1058
00:46:20,377 --> 00:46:23,176
and haircuts and maybe hygiene.
I respect that.

1059
00:46:23,339 --> 00:46:27,810
Well, I think respect is the key to the
beginning of rebuilding a friendship.

1060
00:46:27,927 --> 00:46:30,180
- Is that a saying? Maybe?
- Yeah, sure. Who said that?

1061
00:46:30,346 --> 00:46:33,520
I don't know. I wanna hear
about this husband of yours.

1062
00:46:34,517 --> 00:46:38,397
What's the story?
Is he still charming, sensible, rich?

1063
00:46:38,938 --> 00:46:40,736
No. Dead.

1064
00:46:41,190 --> 00:46:42,988
Yeah, same with me.

1065
00:46:43,150 --> 00:46:44,948
Dead to me. Divorced.

1066
00:46:45,861 --> 00:46:49,707
No, I mean he's "dead" dead.
He actually died.

1067
00:46:50,157 --> 00:46:51,249
He's dead?

1068
00:46:52,159 --> 00:46:53,331
For real?

1069
00:46:53,744 --> 00:46:54,836
Oh...

1070
00:46:54,912 --> 00:46:57,085
Yeah, he, um...

1071
00:46:57,164 --> 00:46:59,713
He died in a car crash.
We were separated already.

1072
00:46:59,792 --> 00:47:01,169
Oh, you already separated.

1073
00:47:01,502 --> 00:47:03,129
- Yeah.
- And now he's dead. He's gone.

1074
00:47:03,295 --> 00:47:04,387
- He's gone.
- Officially.

1075
00:47:04,547 --> 00:47:07,141
Act a little more upset about it.

1076
00:47:07,299 --> 00:47:09,802
I know, but, anyway, how are you?
How's your life?

Great. I lost my business. Divorced.
Playing tag competitively.

00:47:14,306 --> 00:47:15,353
Pretty much rock bottom.

- Fuck yes, lam.

1398
01:01:43,299 --> 01:01:44,300
Oh, Jesus.

1399
01:01:44,467 --> 01:01:46,014
No one's jerking you off, kid,

1400
01:01:46,177 --> 01:01:47,895
'cause Jerry has pushed us
to the fucking edge.

1401
01:01:48,054 --> 01:01:50,148
If you don't tell us
what we need to know,

1402
01:01:50,223 --> 01:01:51,850
you're going over the edge with us.

1403
01:01:52,016 --> 01:01:53,142
You ready to die for this shit?

1404
01:01:53,309 --> 01:01:55,437
I'd rather die than get sucked off
by you homophobes.

1405
01:01:55,603 --> 01:01:58,482
We're not gonna suck you off.
We're gonna waterboard you.

1406
01:01:58,648 --> 01:02:00,525
I'm just taking
a principled stand right now.

1407
01:02:00,692 --> 01:02:02,945
Okay. Well, guess what.
Now, this is gonna happen. All right?

1408
01:02:03,111 --> 01:02:04,863
Are you ready?
I hope you can hold your breath, son!

1409
01:02:04,946 --> 01:02:05,947
DO it!

- Yeah!
- Yeah! You son of a bitch!

1412
01:02:09,993 --> 01:02:11,085
BOB: Here it comes!

1413
01:02:11,244 --> 01:02:12,416
ANNA: It's coming!
It's coming! It's coming!

1414
01:02:12,579 --> 01:02:14,377
Yeah. You know, we should not.

1415
01:02:14,539 --> 01:02:16,712
I feel like it would be way too much.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1416
01:02:16,875 --> 01:02:17,922
Phew. That got out of hand.

1417
01:02:18,084 --> 01:02:19,757
My heart is beating
really fast right now.

1418
01:02:19,919 --> 01:02:22,013
We were just kidding.
We were just bluffing.

1419
01:02:22,172 --> 01:02:24,766
ANNA: No, we weren't fucking bluffing!
BOB: Anna, Anna, Anna!

1420
01:02:24,924 --> 01:02:27,052
- Oh, my God, no. Just, no.
- Sweetheart.

1421
01:02:27,218 --> 01:02:30,062
It's a war crime, right?
It's not really who we are.

1422
01:02:30,221 --> 01:02:31,222
Yes, sorry.

1423
01:02:31,389 --> 01:02:33,266
We got a kinky cat over here.

1424
01:02:33,600 --> 01:02:35,022
- Okay.
- Fuck you, Dave.

1425
01:02:35,185 --> 01:02:37,028
God, I love your passion.

1426
01:02:37,187 --> 01:02:38,814
I'll tell you what.

1427
01:02:40,732 --> 01:02:43,702
I will tell you where Jerry's gonna be

1428
01:02:44,527 --> 01:02:48,202
for $2,000. Cash. American.

1429
01:02:48,364 --> 01:02:49,365
- Okay, fine.
- No problem.

1430
01:02:49,532 --> 01:02:50,875
Why didn't you say that
in the first place?

1431
01:02:51,034 --> 01:02:52,581
Why did you take us
down this whole road?

1432
01:02:52,744 --> 01:02:54,417
Well, it looked like
there was room to negotiate,

1433
01:02:54,496 --> 01:02:55,622
and I was all prepared to do that.

1434
01:02:55,788 --> 01:02:57,961
But then we went down
the whole torture track,

1435
01:02:58,124 --> 01:03:01,219
and I just dug
my heels in, philosophically.

1436
01:03:01,294 --> 01:03:02,921
I happen to be an objector.

1437
01:03:03,004 --> 01:03:05,427
- We are too, obviously.
- Not really.

1438
01:03:05,590 --> 01:03:06,591
It was a bluff.

1439
01:03:06,758 --> 01:03:08,260
You know what?
You should probably not write this down,

1440
01:03:08,426 --> 01:03:09,552
and if it does come up,

1441
01:03:09,719 --> 01:03:12,814
just mention that
we didn't actually waterboard him.

1442
01:03:12,972 --> 01:03:13,973
No waterboarding.

1443
01:03:14,140 --> 01:03:16,359
Just a lot of talk about
sucking each other's dicks.

1444
01:03:16,893 --> 01:03:17,894
Yeah.

1445
01:03:18,895 --> 01:03:20,238
Okay, look, you know what? Here.

1446
01:03:20,396 --> 01:03:26,449
I'm gonna give you $2,000,
and I'm gonna give you an extra $500.

1447
01:03:26,611 --> 01:03:28,659
You just carry around that kind of cash
all day?

1448
01:03:28,821 --> 01:03:30,823
You were mentioning something
about Jerry, I think.

1449
01:03:30,990 --> 01:03:34,335
Yeah, uh, Jerry is in AA.

1450
01:03:34,494 --> 01:03:37,043
- Wait, what?
- Yeah. Alcoholics Anonymous.

1451
01:03:37,205 --> 01:03:39,207
I know what it stands for. Wait, did you
guys know anything about this?

1452
01:03:39,582 --> 01:03:42,301
He goes there every morning
at a church on Brunswick.

1453
01:03:42,460 --> 01:03:44,178
Looking back, I can kind of see it.

1454
01:03:44,337 --> 01:03:46,806
I mean, the first step is recognizing
you have a problem.

1455
01:03:47,507 --> 01:03:49,930
I'm just glad
he's getting the help he needs.

1456
01:03:50,552 --> 01:03:52,225
Sorry, did you say
that church is on Brunswick?

1457
01:03:52,387 --> 01:03:53,388
- Yes.
- HOAGIE: Okay!

- Thank you!

1459
01:03:55,014 --> 01:03:56,357
So sorry.

I told you this wasn't gonna be just
another boring corporate profile, right?

1462
01:04:00,270 --> 01:04:01,772
Right. This is definitely different.

1463
01:04:01,938 --> 01:04:04,441
And I know I'm no longer
the center of the story,

1464
01:04:04,607 --> 01:04:06,735
which is fine with me.
I don't mind giving up the...

(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

Bob, can I buy you a drink?

1467
01:04:11,864 --> 01:04:13,582
Can you fucking believe this?
Hold on one second.

1468

- Maybe...
- One second, one second.

1469

So that we will never do it...

1470
01:04:17,704 --> 01:04:21,208
Hi! Hi! Wow! L00k at this.

1471
01:04:21,374 --> 01:04:22,421
- How you doing?
- Good.

1472
01:04:22,584 --> 01:04:23,756
Pretty good.
Yeah, we're just catching up.

1473
01:04:23,918 --> 01:04:25,295
That's so nice. How's that knee?

1474
01:04:25,461 --> 01:04:27,213
- It actually does hurt.
- Yeah.

1475
01:04:27,380 --> 01:04:30,008
But resting and talking to an old friend
has actually really helped.

1476
01:04:30,174 --> 01:04:31,346
Thank you for asking.

1477
01:04:31,426 --> 01:04:32,928
Hey, how was the business call
with Beijing?

1478
01:04:33,469 --> 01:04:34,470
- Super good.
- It was?

1479
01:04:34,554 --> 01:04:36,477
- Yeah, I got a lot done.
- Great.

1480
01:04:36,556 --> 01:04:38,604
Oh, what, you think I faked
my business call to Beijing

1481
01:04:38,683 --> 01:04:39,900
like you faked hurting your knee?

1482

You know what, dude?
I'm sick of this shit, Bob.

- You're it. How about that?
- No! Pass.

1484
01:04:44,314 --> 01:04:46,112
- You can't pass. And you can't tag back.
- You're it. I pass.

- You cannot tag me back!

You part of the whole

1500
01:05:10,048 --> 01:05:12,050
I mean, Jerry invited me
to the rehearsal dinner

1501
01:05:12,216 --> 01:05:14,810
because he thought it would distract
you guys, which it did.

01:05:14,969 --> 01:05:18,519
But, um, I wanted to see you. So I came.

Both of you. But I love you both.

is the fact that we're a team.

But it's not. Now, come on, guys.

1699
01:15:20,074 --> 01:15:21,576
I'm gonna get to the bottom of this.

1700
01:15:21,742 --> 01:15:23,244
- Bob.
- What'd I do?

1701
01:15:23,410 --> 01:15:24,502
Can I take a photograph of you?

1702
01:15:24,787 --> 01:15:26,039
No. Okay.

1703
01:15:26,121 --> 01:15:27,122
-(CAMERA CLICKS)
- Cute.

1704
01:15:27,456 --> 01:15:28,833
I'm gonna set up
an lnstagram account for you.

1705
01:15:28,999 --> 01:15:30,000
Please don't.

1706
01:15:30,125 --> 01:15:32,628
Rachel Ditmus is the only bridesmaid
with a private lnstagram account.

1707
01:15:32,795 --> 01:15:35,048
She's been wanting you to finger bang
her since the sixth grade.

1708
01:15:35,631 --> 01:15:38,350
If anybody's stupid enough
to fall for our request,

1709
01:15:38,425 --> 01:15:41,053
-it will be that dum-dum.
-(CELL PHONE CHIMES)

1710
01:15:41,136 --> 01:15:44,265
And sent.
All we've got to do now is wait.

1711
01:15:44,348 --> 01:15:46,521
-(CELL PHONE CHIMES)
- And accepted!

1712
01:15:46,684 --> 01:15:48,152
- Really?
- That was weirdly fast.

1713
01:15:48,310 --> 01:15:49,562
Do not finger bang her.

1714
01:15:49,728 --> 01:15:52,481
Oh, my God. I was right.

1715
01:15:52,648 --> 01:15:54,776
- What? What are we looking at here?
- What the hell is this?

1716
01:15:54,942 --> 01:15:56,034
A wedding dress.

1717
01:15:56,193 --> 01:15:57,194
What the fuck?

1718
01:15:57,778 --> 01:15:59,155
They faked the fucking miscarriage!

1719
01:15:59,321 --> 01:16:01,744
No, no, no. Jerry's going down.
We're gonna destroy that wedding.

1720
01:16:01,907 --> 01:16:03,580
- CHILLI: Let's go!
- This is bullshit. That is so fucked up.

1721
01:16:03,742 --> 01:16:04,743
- Absolutely.
-(HOAGIE YELLING)

1722
01:16:08,163 --> 01:16:09,164
Hoagie?

1723
01:16:11,583 --> 01:16:12,835
Hoagie, what are you doing?

1724
01:16:13,127 --> 01:16:14,299
HOAGIE: Damn it!

1725
01:16:14,920 --> 01:16:16,342
- Sweetie.
- Hoagie?

1726
01:16:16,505 --> 01:16:17,848
Be careful.

1727
01:16:18,799 --> 01:16:20,392
Should we stop him, or...

1728
01:16:20,551 --> 01:16:22,770
I'm not getting near him.
He's swinging that bat around.

1729
01:16:24,263 --> 01:16:25,355
(HOAGIE YELLS)

1730
01:16:25,431 --> 01:16:27,433
- Sweetie, that's your mom's.
- Yeah, you're gonna hurt yourself.

1731
01:16:29,810 --> 01:16:31,437
(PANTING)

1732
01:16:31,520 --> 01:16:32,942
(YELLING)

1733
01:16:35,649 --> 01:16:41,201
We lost! He beat us! The game is over!

1734
01:16:41,322 --> 01:16:42,915
(PANTING)

1735
01:16:42,990 --> 01:16:44,617
We can't tag Jerry.

1736
01:16:44,700 --> 01:16:45,747
(STAMMERS)

1737
01:16:45,826 --> 01:16:49,751
It's just time for us to come to terms
with that. He's untouchable. That's it.

1738
01:16:49,913 --> 01:16:51,506
What do you wanna do?
You wanna just give up?

1739
01:16:51,665 --> 01:16:54,168
Yeah, Bob. I wanna give up.
It's time to give up.

1740
01:16:54,335 --> 01:16:55,928
Come on, Hogan. You're not a quitter.

1741
01:16:56,086 --> 01:16:57,429
What's the alternative?

1742
01:16:57,880 --> 01:17:00,429
We go to the wedding.
We try to tag him. We fail.

1743
01:17:01,008 --> 01:17:02,510
And we fuck up the wedding?

1744
01:17:02,593 --> 01:17:04,095
That's not a cool move.
That's a dick move.

1745
01:17:04,261 --> 01:17:05,808
That's not what friends do.
That's what assholes do.

1746
01:17:05,971 --> 01:17:08,770
Hoagie! He faked a fucking miscarriage.

1747
01:17:08,932 --> 01:17:11,026
This is a miscarriage ofjustice.

1748
01:17:12,061 --> 01:17:13,404
This is where we get him.

1749
01:17:13,562 --> 01:17:14,779
He deserves to pay for that.

1750
01:17:15,647 --> 01:17:17,991
Even if we wanted to do that,
we all signed an amendment.

1751
01:17:18,150 --> 01:17:21,404
Amendments are null and void
if you fake a miscarriage.

1752
01:17:21,570 --> 01:17:23,117
That's just basic contract law.

1753
01:17:23,280 --> 01:17:24,873
- That's law. Basic contract law.
- Law.

1754
01:17:25,032 --> 01:17:26,033
Like he said.

1755
01:17:26,200 --> 01:17:28,498
- I literally said exactly that.
- I know. We're saying it together.

1756
01:17:28,660 --> 01:17:32,005
But I was also right earlier
because I said the miscarriage was fake.

1757
01:17:32,081 --> 01:17:36,211
The amendment stands,
and maybe that's a good thing.

1758
01:17:36,835 --> 01:17:39,714
Maybe it's time to grow up a little.

1759
01:17:40,089 --> 01:17:42,012
- Uh...
- I'm going to the wedding.

1760
01:17:42,758 --> 01:17:47,184
And you guys can do what you want.
I hope you come too.

1761
01:17:47,346 --> 01:17:49,189
Chilli, just put on a tie.

1762
01:17:52,601 --> 01:17:53,648
Sweetie.

1763
01:17:57,439 --> 01:17:58,531
Do you even have a tie?

1764
01:17:58,690 --> 01:17:59,862
Yes, I have a tie.

1765
01:17:59,942 --> 01:18:01,660
- Do you need to borrow a tie?
- Yes, I need to borrow a tie.

1766
01:18:01,735 --> 01:18:02,736
Okay.

1767
01:18:08,867 --> 01:18:10,869
(RAP MUSIC PLAYING)

1768
01:18:29,763 --> 01:18:31,606
(ALL CHEERING)

1769
01:18:44,820 --> 01:18:47,994
Hi! I'm so glad you made it!

1770
01:18:48,073 --> 01:18:49,325
Is that champagne?

1771
01:18:49,408 --> 01:18:51,456
I know. Ugh.

1772
01:18:51,869 --> 01:18:53,587
I'm the girl who cried miscarriage.

1773
01:18:53,745 --> 01:18:57,090
But I had to get him out of that room
and distract you for a couple of hours

1774
01:18:57,249 --> 01:18:58,717
so that the amendment could kick in.

1775
01:18:58,876 --> 01:19:00,503
Wait. Are you even pregnant?

1776
01:19:00,586 --> 01:19:02,008
No, I was never pregnant.

1777
01:19:02,171 --> 01:19:03,297
You were never pregnant?

1778
01:19:03,380 --> 01:19:04,506
ALL: Whoa.

1779
01:19:04,590 --> 01:19:06,092
Just listen. Jerry knew

1780
01:19:06,258 --> 01:19:08,056
that you guys might get the drop on him

1781
01:19:08,218 --> 01:19:10,937
so "Operation Miscarriage"
was our fail-safe.

1782
01:19:11,096 --> 01:19:13,269
- It was an operation?
- It was actually my idea.

1783
01:19:13,474 --> 01:19:14,976
- Brilliant. Brilliant!
- Ah, thanks.

1784
01:19:15,142 --> 01:19:16,314
That's diabolical.

1785
01:19:16,477 --> 01:19:19,481
Everyone's just pissed because you won,
and they're boys.

1786
01:19:19,563 --> 01:19:22,863
They can't get pregnant,
so they can't fake a miscarriage.

1787
01:19:22,983 --> 01:19:24,405
(CHUCKLING) It's true.

1788
01:19:24,568 --> 01:19:26,787
Look, I'm not saying I want you
to have a miscarriage.

1789
01:19:26,945 --> 01:19:27,946
Then don't.

1790
01:19:28,113 --> 01:19:31,287
'Cause that would be terrible.
But if you ever do have a miscarriage,

1791
01:19:31,450 --> 01:19:33,999
I don't wanna say that you would
deserve it 'cause that's too far,

1792
01:19:34,161 --> 01:19:36,539
but what I will say and what I do feel

1793
01:19:36,705 --> 01:19:38,673
-is that's what you get.
-(BOB GROANS)

1794
01:19:39,208 --> 01:19:42,303
Okay. It's fine.
We can all have different feelings.

1795
01:19:42,377 --> 01:19:45,051
But it's our wedding day, you guys.
Come on.

1796
01:19:45,214 --> 01:19:47,342
And we came up with this great amendment

1797
01:19:47,508 --> 01:19:52,139
so that we could all enjoy this day
together and have fun and relax.

1798
01:19:52,304 --> 01:19:53,396
Are we cool?

1799
01:19:54,097 --> 01:19:56,099
- CHILLI: Yeah, I guess so.
- Not yet. (CHUCKLES)

1800
01:19:56,475 --> 01:20:00,901
Sorry. Not cool yet.
It's just, you did murder a child.

1801
01:20:00,979 --> 01:20:01,980
No.

1802
01:20:02,064 --> 01:20:03,111
She didn't.
No, it was a fake miscarriage.

1803
01:20:03,273 --> 01:20:06,152
Yeah, not the imaginary child
that was inside of you,

1804
01:20:06,318 --> 01:20:10,073
but the actual inner child
that lives inside of me

1805
01:20:10,239 --> 01:20:11,491
got decapitated.

1806
01:20:11,615 --> 01:20:16,041
Head flew up, did flips in the air,
blood spurting everywhere.

1807
01:20:16,203 --> 01:20:19,707
Hoagie, Jerry has a perfect record,

1808
01:20:19,873 --> 01:20:21,341
and we're a team now.

1809
01:20:21,792 --> 01:20:22,918
The winning team.

1810
01:20:23,085 --> 01:20:25,838
And I just feel like, Hoagie,
if you're gonna play

1811
01:20:26,004 --> 01:20:29,178
a children's game as a grown man,

1812
01:20:29,341 --> 01:20:32,094
maybe, next time,
don't play like a child.

1813
01:20:34,137 --> 01:20:37,732
Anyways, I am really excited
you guys are here.

1814
01:20:37,891 --> 01:20:40,440
Try the raw bar. It's off the hook.

1815
01:20:40,602 --> 01:20:42,730
It's my wedding!
I'm getting married! (LAUGHS)

1816
01:20:42,896 --> 01:20:45,524
- Congratulations.
- Come on! Grab it!

1817
01:20:50,195 --> 01:20:53,074
I take back everything I said
about her being effervescent.

1818
01:20:53,824 --> 01:20:55,667
I met Jerry in AA.

1819
01:20:55,826 --> 01:20:58,750
You see, people,
I got a lot of problems.

1820
01:20:58,912 --> 01:21:03,964
Anger issues. I left my wife.
I have many kids.

1821
01:21:04,126 --> 01:21:07,380
And this man
got me to turn to the cloth.

1822
01:21:07,546 --> 01:21:09,344
It was a low point in my life.

1823
01:21:09,506 --> 01:21:11,679
There was jail time involved.

1824
01:21:11,842 --> 01:21:14,061
I briefly converted to Islam.

1825
01:21:14,219 --> 01:21:18,474
I lost a long legal battle
with Jo-Ann Fabrics.

1826
01:21:18,640 --> 01:21:21,894
During that time, I got to know
Jerry and Susan as a couple.

1827
01:21:22,060 --> 01:21:23,186
And that is a true blessing.

1828
01:21:23,353 --> 01:21:25,776
What's the difference between
Episcopalian and Lutheran?

1829
01:21:25,939 --> 01:21:28,408
Episcopalians don't eat fish.

1830
01:21:29,568 --> 01:21:33,243
That's pescatarian.
That's not a religion.

1831
01:21:33,405 --> 01:21:35,078
They're all fanatics. I don't know.

1832
01:21:35,824 --> 01:21:38,668
Remind me again, is it on the kiss
or after they walk back down the aisle?

1833
01:21:38,827 --> 01:21:41,580
Seriously?
You said you'd worked weddings before.

1834
01:21:41,747 --> 01:21:45,672
The kiss, the doves, end of ceremony.
The groom was very specific about this.

1835
01:21:45,834 --> 01:21:48,553
PASTOR: ...and finds new ways
of expressing love

1836
01:21:48,629 --> 01:21:51,508
through the ups and downs of life.

1837
01:21:51,673 --> 01:21:55,052
Susan, do you take Jerry
to be your husband?

1838
01:21:55,761 --> 01:21:58,230
Do you promise to love, honor,
cherish and protect him,

1839
01:21:58,388 --> 01:22:02,393
forsaking all others,
holding only to him forever more?

1840
01:22:03,060 --> 01:22:04,152
I do.

1841
01:22:04,311 --> 01:22:05,312
Beautiful.

1842
01:22:05,479 --> 01:22:07,322
(WHISPERS) There's gonna be a window.

1843
01:22:07,481 --> 01:22:09,483
- What, sweetie?
- The doves.

1844
01:22:10,192 --> 01:22:11,614
What about the doves?

1845
01:22:11,818 --> 01:22:13,445
There's an opening.

1846
01:22:13,862 --> 01:22:15,614
Just relax, honey.

1847
01:22:16,198 --> 01:22:17,996
You seem stressed.

1848
01:22:19,242 --> 01:22:21,870
Jerry, do you take Susan
to be your wife?

1849
01:22:22,913 --> 01:22:25,962
Do you promise to love, honor, cherish,
and protect her

1850
01:22:26,124 --> 01:22:30,254
forsaking all others,

I mean, if it seems like we were closer,

we're physically closer

to get away from each other.
