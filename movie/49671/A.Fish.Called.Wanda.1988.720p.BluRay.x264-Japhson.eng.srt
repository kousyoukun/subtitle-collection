1
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:28,050
And on that point, members of the jury...

2
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:30,120
I rest my case.

3
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:26,280
Hello, Wanda.

4
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:35,420


5
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:42,060
- Hi, Ken. - Hello, Wanda.

6
00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:45,780
Ken, this is Otto.

7
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:48,390
Hello, Ken. Wanda's told me a lot about you.

8
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:50,560
Hey, great fish!

9
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,200
A little squeeze of lemon, some tartar sauce, perfect.

10
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:56,900
George back yet?

11
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:59,870
No, he had to go to--

12
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:06,410
What?

13
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:08,910
That's quite a stutter you've got there, Ken.

14
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:11,680
It doesn't bother me.

15
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:15,220
So George needs a weapons man, eh?

16
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:17,580
A cup of tea, Ken?

17
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:21,060
Yeah, he'd like one.

18
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:23,530
I had a good friend in the C.I.A. had a stutter.

19
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:26,230
It cost him his life, damn it.

20
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:29,870
Hi, George.

21
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:34,140
Hello, George. Get you a scotch?

22
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:35,710
Yeah.

23
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:40,410
This is Otto.

24
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,620
- You're Wanda's brother. - It's good to be here, George.

25
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:47,950
England is a fine country.

26
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:50,520
She tell you what we need?

27
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:01,870
Something like that?

28
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:05,570
Something like that.

29
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:09,340
Hello, Wendy.

30
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:13,770
Had a good day?

31
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:16,680
I spent the morning trying to get the waste disposal man to come...

32
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:20,450
have lunch with Majorie Brooks who complained about her husband...

33
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:23,320
then I had to play three rubbers with Philippa Hunter...

34
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:26,360
and I come back here and Sanderson's have sent the wrong flowers.

35
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:28,430
Oh, no.

36
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:33,330
- Would you like some tea? - Yes.

37
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:36,060
I won the case.

38
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:39,570
This is the first moment I've had to myself all day.

39
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:45,550
Hello, Portia. How was the show?

40
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:47,540
Awful, Daddy. I need a new horse.

41
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:50,510
- I thought you liked Phantom. - He's not fit for dog meat.

42
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:53,280
Can I change him please, Dad? It's vital and won't cost much.

43
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,820
- We ought to ask Belinda. - I thought you were making tea.

44
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:57,820
- I am, darling. Sorry. - Suppose I'd better get it.

45
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:00,690
- Let me do it, please. - No, I'll do it.

46
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:07,960
- I won the case. - Now this is cracked.

47
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:14,700
They're worth about 1 00,000 each. There are 1 35 of them.

48
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:17,430
That makes 1 3 million, my friends.

49
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,310
- Dollars or pounds? - Pounds, pet.

50
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:21,880
This is the big one.

51
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:25,980
Okay.

52
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:27,550
Yeah.

53
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:31,760
- Otto? - Yes?

54
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:33,620
Okay?

55
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:36,490
- What? - The plan.

56
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:38,820
Yeah, great. No problem.

57
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:41,630
What was the middle thing about the police?

58
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:45,600
We don't meet up at Heathrow until Tuesday--

59
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,600
- Oh, yeah. - I haven't finished yet.

60
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:51,180
Because the police will watch all the airports...

61
00:05:51,410 --> 00:05:53,110
for 72 hours.

62
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:54,680
I know.

63
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:58,180
You want me to...

64
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:01,790
get a big...

65
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:04,460
car for the getaway?

66
00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:07,290
Yes, Ken. A limo, okay?

67
00:06:07,530 --> 00:06:10,020
And put diplomatic plates on it, right?

68
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:12,100
What if he has to say something during the break-in?

69
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:14,800
Nobody says anything during the break-in, Otto.

70
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:17,970
It's okay, Otto. Ken's good.

71
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:20,040
So, next week...

72
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,440
we won't have to look for work...

73
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:25,370
and it won't have to look for us.

74
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:27,440
Oscar Wilde.

75
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:34,680
You really like animals, don't you, Ken?

76
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,550
What's the attraction?

77
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:38,990
Because you can trust them...

78
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:41,960
and they don't sh--

79
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:45,690
- Shit on you? - Show off all the time.

80
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:47,930
You know what Nietzsche said about them?

81
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:50,930
He said they were God's second blunder.

82
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:52,660
Bye, sis.

83
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:55,270
Well, you tell him from me...

84
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:57,000
that I could show you--

85
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:59,740
Bye, George.

86
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:02,450
If you talk to Mom, tell her I said hi.

87
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:05,950
- Don't let him touch you. - One more day, we're together.

88
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:14,020
I'm sorry about my brother. I know he's insensitive.

89
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:17,200
He's had a hard life. Dad used to beat him up.

90
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,270
Good.

91
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:51,520
Anybody moves, and you're dead!

92
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:25,790
Look where you're going, chauvinist pig.

93
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:29,090
Really, people here just think they own the pavement.

94
00:09:57,260 --> 00:10:00,020
That was fun. I love robbing the English.

95
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:02,020
They're so polite.

96
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:04,030
- What is it, Ken? - The dog.

97
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:05,790
We didn't hit the dog.

98
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:07,800
Twenty million dollars, he's worried about an insect.

99
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:10,870
- It's not an in-- - Stutter's not getting any better.

100
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:13,730
- Have you thought about surgery? - Shut up.

101
00:10:23,450 --> 00:10:24,850
Bye.

102
00:10:56,450 --> 00:10:58,540
- Let's split. - Meet you at Heathrow on Tuesday.

103
00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:00,550
Lie low. No celebrating.

104
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:02,880
No celebrating?

105
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,890
- See you in a couple of hours. - Okay. Bye.

106
00:11:54,410 --> 00:11:56,380
- To 20 million. - To a job well done.

107
00:11:56,610 --> 00:11:57,600
To us.

108
00:11:57,850 --> 00:12:00,680
To the best brother and sister team since--

109
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:03,080
Romeo and Juliet? Yeah.

110
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:07,010
Do you believe those Cockney klutzes bought our story? What morons!

111
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:09,350
- I want you to know something. - What?

112
00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:12,620
Even if you were my brother, I'd still want to fuck you.

113
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:17,700
Make the call.

114
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:21,430
No Italian!

115
00:12:29,210 --> 00:12:31,680
Make the call, Otto.

116
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:33,740
Are you really Italian?

117
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:38,740
My name is Otto. It means ''eight.'' Say ''Arrivederci a Georgio. ''

118
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:42,050
- Good-bye, George. - Can you put me through to the police?

119
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:47,530
Yes, hello. Sorry to trouble you.

120
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:51,430
I thought it might interest you to know the Hatton Garden robbery...

121
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:55,330
was pulled off by a Mr. George Thomason...

122
00:12:55,570 --> 00:12:57,970
who lives at Flat Three...

123
00:12:58,210 --> 00:13:00,640
Kipling Mansions, Murray Road...

124
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,370
London West Nine.

125
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:31,210
Police. Open up.

126
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,030
Come on. Open up.

127
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:40,040
Open the door, or we'll knock it down.

128
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:52,160
George Francis Thomason.

129
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:07,300
Passport? Tickets?

130
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:08,870
Money.

131
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,380
Asshole!

132
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:29,060
- We're rich, Wanda. - Yup.

133
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:34,660
Bet these last weeks with me were the most exciting weeks of your life.

134
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:36,840
You said it.

135
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:51,180
Okay.

136
00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:53,890
Disappointed!

137
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:56,820
Son of a bitch!

138
00:14:57,060 --> 00:15:00,030
What do you have to do in this life to make people trust you?

139
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:02,460
Shut up.

140
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:05,030
- People always take advantage of me. - Shut up and think.

141
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:07,100
Where has he moved it?

142
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:12,800
- What are you doing? - I'm thinking.

143
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,970
I'm thinking of what I'm going to do to him.

144
00:15:15,210 --> 00:15:17,640
First I'll hang him up with piano wire. Where are you going?

145
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,940
I'm going to talk to him.

146
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,880
Talk to who?

147
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:26,990
In the course of installing these windows for your parents...

148
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:30,820
you knelt on the floor where there was broken glass from a dropped pane.

149
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:32,050
That's right.

150
00:15:32,290 --> 00:15:34,280
Your mother and father can confirm this?

151
00:15:34,530 --> 00:15:37,220
Yes, and his aunt, Georgina Thomason.

152
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:40,260
Good, Bartlett. Yes?

153
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:45,100
Sorry to interrupt you, sir. Thomason, young lady to see you.

154
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:47,430
- Anything else? - That's everything for the moment.

155
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,010
- You don't have to dash off? - No, absolutely not.

156
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,340
George, Ken's got the fish food.

157
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:54,670
- He'll be in later. - Thanks.

158
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:59,510
- What do you think, Mr. Leach? - We may be all right with the glass.

159
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:01,590
What else are they gonna come up with?

160
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:16,560
Oh, my God. I can't believe this is happening.

161
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,670
That's not allowed in here, miss.

162
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:21,840
- Are you okay? - I'm all right.

163
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:24,200
George, I don't think I can handle this.

164
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:27,350
I was so afraid to sleep last night. I thought the police were coming.

165
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:29,340
Leave it out, okay?

166
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:32,180
Listen, listen.

167
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:36,560
You stayed at my place.

168
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:41,560
We slept late. You made me breakfast.

169
00:16:46,330 --> 00:16:48,230
What?

170
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:50,330
What's he doing here?

171
00:16:50,570 --> 00:16:52,540
He wanted to see you.

172
00:16:52,770 --> 00:16:55,670
Who did it, George? Kevin Delaney?

173
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:58,670
You want me to rub him out? Anything. You name it.

174
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:03,680
- I have friends making inquiries. - Good.

175
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:06,480
The jewels are very safe.

176
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:10,180
If I get sent down, it all gets handed back to cut my sentence.

177
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:12,690
Now, to cut my sentence even more...

178
00:17:12,930 --> 00:17:14,990
I could tell them who done it with me...

179
00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:18,530
if I wasn't very happy about everything.

180
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:22,130
What was the middle thing?

181
00:17:22,370 --> 00:17:24,200
Piss off.

182
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:30,040
- Do you want me to-- - Now.

183
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:40,890
- You don't think-- - Do you?

184
00:17:51,530 --> 00:17:52,590
- George? - What?

185
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:57,260
Are you sure the garage is very safe?

186
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,170
Trust me.

187
00:18:01,410 --> 00:18:03,670
Thank you very much.

188
00:18:03,910 --> 00:18:06,210
Thanks a lot. Bye. Have a good day.

189
00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:09,680
- So? - He's not sure it was you.

190
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,850
- That's something, I guess. - What about you?

191
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:15,110
He believes me. That's why he can't figure out about you.

192
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:18,350
- Figure out what? - If you turned him in or not, stupid.

193
00:18:20,290 --> 00:18:22,020
Don't...

194
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:25,060
ever, ever...

195
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:27,360
call me stupid, okay?

196
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,290
What?

197
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:36,870
That's George's lawyer.

198
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:39,710
The other guy must be the barrister.

199
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:43,280
- So? - Trust me.

200
00:18:46,790 --> 00:18:49,050
You let me know if anything unexpected turns up.

201
00:18:49,290 --> 00:18:51,160
Excuse me.

202
00:18:51,390 --> 00:18:53,620
Don't I recognize you?

203
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:55,920
No, I don't think so.

204
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:00,660
But you are a famous barrister, aren't you?

205
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:04,100
Well, hardly.

206
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:07,000
Could I have your autograph anyway?

207
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:11,740
- Yes, certainly. - Thanks.

208
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:14,450
I'm studying aspects of your legal system.

209
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:16,880
- I'm American. - Oh, really?

210
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:19,210
I've only just started, though. It's fascinating.

211
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:21,890
What brings you here?

212
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:23,890
It's a little embarrassing.

213
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:26,350
I have a friend.

214
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,430
Oh, I see. Well, there you are.

215
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:32,630
I knew it! You're Archie Leash!

216
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:34,840
- Leach. - Right.

217
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:38,560
I saw you in court two weeks ago.

218
00:19:38,810 --> 00:19:41,570
- The casino break-in? - You were great!

219
00:19:41,810 --> 00:19:44,140
- Well. - I'm a big fan of yours.

220
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:47,370
I love the way you cross-examine.

221
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:51,080
I really admire your work.

222
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:53,150
Thank you.

223
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:58,490
- I'd better not keep you. - I don't suppose you-- Fine. Right.

224
00:19:58,730 --> 00:19:59,920
Well.

225
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:03,100
Thank you for this. I'll treasure it.

226
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:13,340
You speak French too.

227
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:33,560
What's going on?

228
00:20:33,790 --> 00:20:37,250
Whatever George decides to do, he's going to tell Leach first.

229
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:40,090
- Why? - 'Cause he's his lawyer.

230
00:20:40,330 --> 00:20:44,360
- Yeah, I know that. - So I'm gonna get to know Mr. Leach.

231
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:46,970
'Cause George is gonna tell him where the diamonds are.

232
00:20:47,210 --> 00:20:49,610
That's what I'm gonna find out.

233
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:03,890
You've done well, my son.

234
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:06,650
Now, where are we going to hide it?

235
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:13,630
Very good. Don't tell Wanda anything.

236
00:21:13,870 --> 00:21:16,800
Otto might get something out of her.

237
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:20,600
George, you are gonna get off?

238
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:23,570
Sure, don't worry about it, Ken. We'll fix it.

239
00:21:23,810 --> 00:21:25,640
Now, anything on Otto?

240
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:30,580
- Not yet. - You watch him.

241
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:38,490
It's okay.

242
00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:41,160
Looks like the police have been all over it.

243
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:44,850
Let me just change clothes, then I'll help you look.

244
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:48,870
Hello, Ken's pets.

245
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:55,540
Wake up, limey fish!

246
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:01,050
So, how are you gonna get friendly with this lawyer?

247
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,610
I don't know. I'll improvise.

248
00:22:03,850 --> 00:22:05,410
Fucking insects!

249
00:22:05,650 --> 00:22:08,710
I thought Englishmen didn't like women, the way they talk.

250
00:22:10,690 --> 00:22:15,290
He's straight. He's kind of cute, in a pompous sort of way.

251
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,260
You got the hots for him?

252
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:21,660
I'm not into necrophilia. Thanks.

253
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:24,500
What is this? Hump-a-limey week, suddenly?

254
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:27,730
Otto doesn't approve. Otto might get jealous.

255
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:44,580
Oh, speak it!

256
00:22:46,590 --> 00:22:48,080
Yeah.

257
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:02,880
No, not here, Otto.

258
00:23:04,210 --> 00:23:06,110
Not here, Otto.

259
00:23:07,450 --> 00:23:09,440
No, not here,

260
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:10,810
Otto. No,

261
00:23:24,130 --> 00:23:26,730
Look what I've got, Wanda.

262
00:23:28,370 --> 00:23:30,270
A treasure.

263
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:20,150
Oh, my God, Ken, it's you. I thought it was the police again.

264
00:24:20,390 --> 00:24:22,980
Isn't it horrible about George? Oh, Ken!

265
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:27,020
I have such a bad headache. Could you run and get me some aspirin?

266
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:28,460
- Shit. - What's that?

267
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:31,060
That's my brother. He's in the bathroom.

268
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:35,260
We just saw George. Oh, it was horrible, Ken.

269
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:37,330
Just horrible.

270
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:45,070
Isn't it terrible about George?

271
00:24:45,310 --> 00:24:47,970
When I find the bastard who squealed--

272
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:50,340
I love that man!

273
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:52,980
What are you doing here?

274
00:24:53,150 --> 00:24:55,350
What am I doing here?

275
00:24:55,590 --> 00:24:59,120
Wanda was upset, Ken. She needed to talk to family.

276
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:02,190
She's just had a shower.

277
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:06,800
I've got to speak to you.

278
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:10,460
- Are you okay now? - I'm fine. Thanks for coming.

279
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:12,670
- Call me if you need me again. - Okay. Thanks.

280
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:18,240
What's the matter with you? Can't you think about her feelings?

281
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:21,910
- There's something funny going on. - Oh, dear.

282
00:25:22,150 --> 00:25:24,780
You don't even know why you're excited, do you?

283
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:29,790
I didn't want to say anything while George was around.

284
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:32,650
Isn't it time you faced up to certain realities?

285
00:25:32,890 --> 00:25:36,260
Come on. You're a very attractive man.

286
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:39,730
You're smart, you've got wonderful bones...

287
00:25:39,970 --> 00:25:43,600
great eyes and you dress really interestingly.

288
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:46,470
We could have a lot of fun together, you and I.

289
00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:49,900
We'd be really good for each other. What do you say?

290
00:25:52,010 --> 00:25:54,000
You must be jo--

291
00:25:54,250 --> 00:25:56,340
- May I kiss you, Ken? - No, you fucking can't!

292
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:59,250
Just a peck. No tongue. Ken!

293
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:08,990
You didn't realize I was gay.

294
00:26:09,230 --> 00:26:11,890
Okay, look, I'm sorry.

295
00:26:12,130 --> 00:26:14,000
I've handled this badly.

296
00:26:14,230 --> 00:26:17,360
Look, the physical side can wait.

297
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,440
You need time.

298
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:23,700
Will you think about it?

299
00:26:45,830 --> 00:26:47,730
Oh, my God.

300
00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:55,440
Ken, somebody just called!

301
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:59,510
They said the police know the loot is in a garage in Fulham somewhere.

302
00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:01,510
You and I have to go get it right now.

303
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:05,080
You and I have to go before the police find out where it is.

304
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:07,080
- What? - It's all right.

305
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:09,260
What?

306
00:27:09,490 --> 00:27:10,820
George.

307
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:14,620
Moved.

308
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:17,850
- George moved the loot? - Yes.

309
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:21,300
Where did he move it, Ken?

310
00:27:34,650 --> 00:27:37,380
I don't know where it is. There's a key. I don't know what it's for.

311
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:39,450
It's in the--

312
00:27:40,750 --> 00:27:44,190
Don't tell me. It's better that you don't tell me.

313
00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:49,220
Oh, you know, if it wasn't for George.

314
00:27:54,570 --> 00:27:55,970
Otto...

315
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:00,400
tried to kiss me.

316
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:04,280
I thought he might.

317
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:10,440
No. Nothing. No marks at all.

318
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:12,780
- But it is a safety deposit box key? - Oh, yes.

319
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:15,210
But it could be any one in England. There are millions of them.

320
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:18,190
Hotels, banks, offices. Sorry.

321
00:28:18,430 --> 00:28:20,480
Thank you.

322
00:28:20,730 --> 00:28:22,060
Fuck.

323
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:41,810
That's him, Inspector.

324
00:28:42,050 --> 00:28:46,080
He's the one who tried to murder my dogs.

325
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:05,200
Davidson?

326
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:08,770
There's an American legal student here who wants to see me for a moment.

327
00:29:09,010 --> 00:29:11,340
- What time's Sir John due? - Half past 1 2:00, sir.

328
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:23,960
Come in.

329
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:27,690
- Hi. - How very nice to see you.

330
00:29:27,930 --> 00:29:30,260
- Am I interrupting? - Absolutely not.

331
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:32,760
- Really? - Really. Delighted to see you.

332
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,330
Hello.

333
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:41,140
So, this is the place, huh?

334
00:29:41,370 --> 00:29:43,600
- This is it. - Very nice.

335
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:46,310
I was over at the courts this morning. Boy, it's fascinating.

336
00:29:46,550 --> 00:29:48,510
- Really so much to know. - You like it?

337
00:29:48,750 --> 00:29:50,910
Everybody wears these. Do you wear one?

338
00:29:51,150 --> 00:29:52,480
Ridiculous.

339
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:59,720
Well, I only have a few minutes before-- Sorry.

340
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:02,620
- I'm sorry. - Till then I'm all yours, as they say.

341
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:05,060
I just have a couple of questions.

342
00:30:07,570 --> 00:30:09,870
I'm having a little problem understanding...

343
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:11,930
- preliminary criminal procedures. - Good.

344
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:15,300
What exactly is the committal?

345
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:17,480
Ah, interesting.

346
00:30:17,710 --> 00:30:20,610
Basically, it's a preliminary investigation...

347
00:30:20,850 --> 00:30:23,250
where the prosecution presents prima facie evidence...

348
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:25,250
that the accused has a case to answer for trial.

349
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:26,850
That's what the books say.

350
00:30:27,090 --> 00:30:30,450
Let's just take, for example, my friend George Thomason.

351
00:30:30,690 --> 00:30:33,320
- Right. - When he goes into his committal--

352
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:36,760
- Thomason? - Yes.

353
00:30:39,870 --> 00:30:42,330
Do you know him?

354
00:30:42,570 --> 00:30:45,540
- I'm defending him. - What are you talking about?

355
00:30:45,770 --> 00:30:47,970
I'm his barrister, his lawyer.

356
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:51,480
That's so great.

357
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:54,640
That's so weird. Isn't that weird?

358
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:58,010
I'm so happy it's you that's defending him.

359
00:30:58,250 --> 00:30:59,180
Thank you.

360
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:01,220
He's sure to get off now.

361
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:04,560
Wow.

362
00:31:04,790 --> 00:31:07,660
- I could watch you work now. - Please.

363
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:11,320
Amazing.

364
00:31:11,570 --> 00:31:16,160
Anyway, at the committal, George would then plead--

365
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:18,460
- Not guilty. - Really?

366
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:21,610
Oh, you see, the evidence against him is largely circumstantial.

367
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:24,170
But there was an identification, wasn't there?

368
00:31:24,410 --> 00:31:28,540
True, but a very elderly lady. I think they've got the wrong man.

369
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:32,110
You don't think he did it.

370
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:37,880
Let's just say, for argument's sake, that you did think he did it.

371
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:42,320
If further evidence against him came to light, for example.

372
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:45,900
You would then advise him to plead guilty...

373
00:31:46,130 --> 00:31:49,690
and turn over the jewels to get his sentence cut.

374
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:53,200
And he would turn them over to who? To you?

375
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:57,540
- Theoretically? - Oh, of course.

376
00:31:57,780 --> 00:32:00,210
Well, uh--

377
00:32:00,450 --> 00:32:03,580
I'm so sorry. I've forgotten your name.

378
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:11,220
Wonderful, wonderful. Wanda, there were really three--

379
00:32:15,830 --> 00:32:19,320
- Not Wanda Gershwitz? - Yes.

380
00:32:19,570 --> 00:32:21,330
Oh, my God.

381
00:32:21,570 --> 00:32:23,900
- What? - You're his alibi.

382
00:32:25,010 --> 00:32:27,270
- I can't talk to you. - Why not?

383
00:32:27,510 --> 00:32:29,980
My dear young lady, you are a defense witness.

384
00:32:30,210 --> 00:32:32,270
I must ask you to leave immediately. I'm so sorry.

385
00:32:32,510 --> 00:32:34,000
What did I say?

386
00:32:34,250 --> 00:32:38,680
- It's not ethical to talk to a witness. - Everybody does it in America.

387
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:40,680
Well, not in England. It's strictly forbidden.

388
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:43,120
I must insist, otherwise I may have to give up the case.

389
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:45,190
I'm sorry. Please?

390
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:58,200
I didn't come here today to talk about boring criminal procedures.

391
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:01,870
Come on. You know.

392
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:06,830
You knew the minute I walked in here.

393
00:33:07,950 --> 00:33:09,470
I want you.

394
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:14,480
What?

395
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:18,490
- SirJohn is here. - Show him in, please.

396
00:33:18,730 --> 00:33:20,820
- I want you to make love with me. - Pardon?

397
00:33:21,060 --> 00:33:22,260
Nothing.

398
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:25,560
- Will you take me to bed, Archie? - No. Sorry.

399
00:33:28,330 --> 00:33:30,230
Bye, Uncle.

400
00:33:52,890 --> 00:33:55,190
He's pleading not guilty...

401
00:33:55,430 --> 00:33:58,190
so you're safe until the trial.

402
00:33:58,430 --> 00:34:00,630
Leach doesn't think he did it.

403
00:34:02,370 --> 00:34:07,030
Ken says there's a safe deposit box key, but only George knows where it is.

404
00:34:08,410 --> 00:34:10,310
Thank you, Wanda.

405
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:16,970
- What have you found out? - Not a lot.

406
00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:20,050
- You realize he's in court tomorrow? - I know that!

407
00:34:20,290 --> 00:34:21,650
So nothing, huh?

408
00:34:21,890 --> 00:34:23,580
Nix.

409
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:25,650
Zip.

410
00:34:25,890 --> 00:34:28,220
Diddly. Bupkes.

411
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:39,300
- Oh, it's too big. - No, it isn't, Portia.

412
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:41,600
- It is enormous. - No, it isn't.

413
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:44,570
- Please, Mother. - No, absolutely not.

414
00:34:44,810 --> 00:34:47,110
I'm so miserable, and you just don't care.

415
00:34:47,350 --> 00:34:49,750
Do shut up, Portia.

416
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:53,420
All I get all day is people complaining to me.

417
00:34:53,650 --> 00:34:55,090
Oh, dear.

418
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:05,010
Archie, I want you to speak to her about plastic surgery.

419
00:37:06,950 --> 00:37:09,790
I do wish you'd listen to me. I want you to speak to Portia.

420
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:12,320
Right. I'll have a word with her in the morning.

421
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:14,390
Good night, Archie.

422
00:37:17,430 --> 00:37:19,800
Good night, Wanda.

423
00:37:20,030 --> 00:37:23,470
- Good night, who? - Sorry, darling.

424
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:28,230
Just some stupid case I've got tomorrow with some lousy old hag.

425
00:37:28,470 --> 00:37:31,600
Are you George Francis Thomason...

426
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:35,370
of Kipling Mansions, Murray Avenue, London W9?

427
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:38,410
Yes, sir.

428
00:37:38,650 --> 00:37:41,550
The charge is one of armed robbery. Sit down, Mr. Thomason.

429
00:37:41,790 --> 00:37:43,880
Are we ready for a committal today, Mr. Percival?

430
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:47,390
Yes, it will be under Section 62, Madam.

431
00:37:47,630 --> 00:37:49,120
That is correct-- 62.

432
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:53,060
Here are the statements, all to be fully bound, please.

433
00:37:54,430 --> 00:37:55,800
Stand up, Mr. Thomason.

434
00:37:56,900 --> 00:38:01,030
You are hereby committed to stand trial at the Central Criminal Court.

435
00:38:01,270 --> 00:38:03,740
There is some urgency about this case, Madam...

436
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:07,170
as the main witness, Mrs. Eileen Coady, is elderly...

437
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:10,610
and has had serious heart difficulties recently.

438
00:38:10,850 --> 00:38:13,110
Is there any possibility that this case...

439
00:38:13,350 --> 00:38:15,620
might be put down for an early trial?

440
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:18,420
That would be for the listing officer at the Old Bailey.

441
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:21,590
Take him down to the cells, please.

442
00:38:21,830 --> 00:38:23,520
Yes, sir.

443
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:29,500
Come along, now.

444
00:38:41,350 --> 00:38:44,180
Hi, hon. How are you doing? Ooh, you look great.

445
00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:46,720
I love your hair. Do you have time for a coffee?

446
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:49,010
- No, I've got to go. - Have you thought about it though?

447
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:53,590
One thing: Why did he give you this? ''Eileen Coady, 69 Basil Street''?

448
00:38:53,830 --> 00:38:55,760
What does he want you to do, send her flowers?

449
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,290
Do her shopping? Show her a good time?

450
00:38:58,530 --> 00:39:00,360
Rub her out?

451
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:06,000
He wants you to rub her out?

452
00:39:07,410 --> 00:39:09,670
He's going to kill her!

453
00:39:12,150 --> 00:39:14,610
Fuck off, or I'll kill you.

454
00:39:14,850 --> 00:39:16,680
Limey fruits!

455
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:22,280
So the old lady's going to meet with an accident, Ken?

456
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:26,990
- What's so funny? - Nothing.

457
00:39:27,230 --> 00:39:30,560
It's just that wasting old ladies isn't nice.

458
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:34,390
Well, it's better than buggering people.

459
00:39:34,630 --> 00:39:37,360
I'll bet you a pound you don't kill her.

460
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:40,540
- All right. - All right.

461
00:39:41,970 --> 00:39:43,840
I love watching your ass when you walk.

462
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:47,050
Is that beautiful, or what?

463
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:51,220
Don't go near him! He's mine!

464
00:39:51,450 --> 00:39:53,890
A pound says you won't kill her.

465
00:39:56,960 --> 00:40:00,550
- When could you look at it? - Well, Thursday's hopeless.

466
00:40:00,790 --> 00:40:02,780
My wife's going to the opera Friday evening.

467
00:40:03,030 --> 00:40:05,330
I could have a look at it then, call you at the office Saturday morning.

468
00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:07,970
I'd really appreciate that. Thanks, Archie.

469
00:40:10,070 --> 00:40:12,900
I know we're not allowed to talk. Give me a call.

470
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:14,130
I can't.

471
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:16,460
Please?

472
00:40:16,710 --> 00:40:20,440
- We're not allowed to speak. - We don't have to.

473
00:40:21,750 --> 00:40:24,340
I don't want you for your conversation.

474
00:40:28,550 --> 00:40:30,550
I'd love to, but--

475
00:40:42,470 --> 00:40:45,700
- What happened? - Got a date Friday.

476
00:41:01,390 --> 00:41:05,350
Look here, do you mind not making that terrible noise?

477
00:41:05,590 --> 00:41:08,860
My dogs will be having their nap.

478
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:11,430
Nice doggy.

479
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:32,510
Otto, what are you doing?

480
00:41:32,750 --> 00:41:36,280
It's a Buddhist meditation technique. It focuses your aggression.

481
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:38,510
The monks used to do it before they went into battle.

482
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:40,950
What kind of Buddhism is this, Otto?

483
00:41:45,770 --> 00:41:48,230
Asshole!

484
00:41:48,470 --> 00:41:51,960
It's an early Tantric medita-- What is this?

485
00:41:52,210 --> 00:41:56,230
In order to get information, I might have to get friendly with him.

486
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:59,270
Well, we're ready now, at last.

487
00:41:59,510 --> 00:42:02,210
- Good. Enjoy the opera, darling. - Your supper's in the fridge.

488
00:42:02,450 --> 00:42:06,010
- Marvelous. Thank you so much. - Be good.

489
00:42:06,250 --> 00:42:09,780
When you say ''friendly,'' what are we talking about here?

490
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:12,860
Cordial? Courteous? Supportive? What?

491
00:42:13,090 --> 00:42:16,390
I don't know. Let's just see what happens.

492
00:42:17,830 --> 00:42:19,660
So, friendly might include...

493
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:22,420
actual, what, penetration, would you say?

494
00:42:22,670 --> 00:42:24,730
- I don't need your jealousy now. -Jealousy?

495
00:42:24,970 --> 00:42:27,600
- Yes. - Hey, I'm merely curious.

496
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:30,400
Me, jealous of that fop?

497
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:41,250
- What about my tits? - Does he get to handle them?

498
00:42:41,490 --> 00:42:44,650
Yes, that's my forecast. I'll stand by that.

499
00:42:44,890 --> 00:42:47,950
- Nuzzling? - I think $20 million is worth nuzzling.

500
00:42:48,190 --> 00:42:50,990
- Eighty percent chance there. - Sucking?

501
00:42:51,230 --> 00:42:53,820
- I thought you weren't jealous. - I'm not. I don't believe in jealousy.

502
00:42:54,070 --> 00:42:55,830
It's for the weak.

503
00:42:56,070 --> 00:42:59,900
One thing, though: touch his dick, and he's dead.

504
00:43:04,980 --> 00:43:07,910
I told your father to get the car serviced.

505
00:43:08,150 --> 00:43:10,910
- Aren't we going, then? - Do shut up, Portia.

506
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:25,660
Hurry up.

507
00:43:44,780 --> 00:43:46,680
Do you despise me?

508
00:43:51,390 --> 00:43:53,920
No, that's not a word that leaps to mind.

509
00:43:55,230 --> 00:43:57,130
Can I stay, then?

510
00:44:02,070 --> 00:44:04,470
Of course. Look.

511
00:44:04,700 --> 00:44:05,930
- Wanda-- - I know.

512
00:44:06,170 --> 00:44:07,640
Your wife's coming back.

513
00:44:07,870 --> 00:44:09,840
No, it's not her. She'll be gone for hours.

514
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:12,040
It's about what I said to you.

515
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:14,080
It is all right for us to speak.

516
00:44:14,310 --> 00:44:18,810
- It is? - Provided we don't discuss the case.

517
00:44:19,050 --> 00:44:21,920
Oh, fine.

518
00:44:22,150 --> 00:44:24,520
It's just that if anyone saw us talking--

519
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:26,590
But they won't.

520
00:44:33,730 --> 00:44:36,760
Sorry if I seem pompous.

521
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,400
Oh, you're the best, Archie.

522
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:48,410
Not yet. I'm thirsty.

523
00:44:51,980 --> 00:44:54,350
What shall I get you?

524
00:44:54,590 --> 00:44:55,920
Whiskey.

525
00:45:00,590 --> 00:45:03,820
You are the sexiest, most beautiful girl...

526
00:45:04,060 --> 00:45:06,690
I have ever seen...

527
00:45:06,930 --> 00:45:09,400
in my entire life.

528
00:45:12,070 --> 00:45:13,970
Get me my drink.

529
00:45:46,870 --> 00:45:49,000
So...

530
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:52,230
if George decides to change his plea...

531
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:55,680
he'd tell you where the loot is first, wouldn't he?

532
00:45:57,780 --> 00:46:00,410
Darling, we mustn't talk about the trial, okay?

533
00:46:00,650 --> 00:46:04,210
I know. I just meant theoretically.

534
00:46:04,460 --> 00:46:06,290
Kiss me there.

535
00:46:07,460 --> 00:46:09,450
Oh, theoretically.

536
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:15,400
Well, if the defendant wants to change his plea...

537
00:46:15,630 --> 00:46:19,070
in his instructions to his legal representative...

538
00:46:20,510 --> 00:46:21,910
the normal procedure--

539
00:46:28,110 --> 00:46:31,170
- What's the matter? - It's wonderful, Archie.

540
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:38,820
- What's the matter? - You're getting me so hot.

541
00:46:39,060 --> 00:46:41,220
- Sorry. - I need something to drink.

542
00:46:41,460 --> 00:46:44,020
Something cold, maybe in the fridge?

543
00:46:44,260 --> 00:46:46,890
- Champagne? - My favorite.

544
00:46:48,370 --> 00:46:50,270
Don't go away.

545
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:07,220
- What are you doing here? - Relax.

546
00:47:07,450 --> 00:47:10,050
- Get the fuck out of here. - I heard moaning. I was worried.

547
00:47:10,290 --> 00:47:12,090
I was faking it, you stupid jerk.

548
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:14,520
Don't ever call me stupid, and I'm not jealous.

549
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:17,020
- Then leave. - Okay.

550
00:47:18,430 --> 00:47:20,960
It's a nice place.

551
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:23,360
Don't touch his dick.

552
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:27,340
His wife.

553
00:47:29,410 --> 00:47:32,210
Now, for goodness' sake, get off to bed.

554
00:47:36,050 --> 00:47:38,540
Oh, God, there isn't any ice.

555
00:47:48,530 --> 00:47:50,220
Champagne.

556
00:47:51,730 --> 00:47:53,160
What's the matter?

557
00:47:54,930 --> 00:47:56,160
What are you doing?

558
00:47:58,600 --> 00:48:00,900
Champagne, dear, to welcome you home.

559
00:48:01,140 --> 00:48:03,340
Let me pour you a glass.

560
00:48:04,740 --> 00:48:06,640
Whose is the car?

561
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:09,010
- The car? - Blocking the drive.

562
00:48:09,250 --> 00:48:11,910
There you are, dear. Cheers. Nice to see you.

563
00:48:12,150 --> 00:48:14,020
How was the opera? Finished early?

564
00:48:14,250 --> 00:48:16,410
Whose car is it?

565
00:48:16,660 --> 00:48:19,280
Mine. It's a beauty, isn't it?

566
00:48:19,530 --> 00:48:22,360
Where did I leave my drink, Archie?

567
00:48:24,260 --> 00:48:26,320
Who is this?

568
00:48:26,570 --> 00:48:28,330
- Don't you know? - How do you do, Mrs. Leach?

569
00:48:28,570 --> 00:48:31,470
I'm Harvey Manfredin St.John.

570
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:34,370
- I'm with the C.I.A. - C.I.A.?

571
00:48:34,610 --> 00:48:36,010
That's correct, ma'am.

572
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:38,870
I was just telling your husband here...

573
00:48:39,110 --> 00:48:42,880
before I had to go to your beautiful bathroom...

574
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:45,610
we've got a high-ranking K.G.B. defector...

575
00:48:45,850 --> 00:48:47,410
in a safe house near here.

576
00:48:47,650 --> 00:48:49,420
We're debriefing him as of now...

577
00:48:49,660 --> 00:48:52,090
and we're just checking...

578
00:48:52,320 --> 00:48:53,550
all the houses in the neighborhood.

579
00:48:53,790 --> 00:48:55,560
- For what? - For K.G.B.

580
00:48:55,790 --> 00:48:57,990
- Is there any danger? - No, no.

581
00:48:59,870 --> 00:49:01,030
Not now.

582
00:49:01,270 --> 00:49:02,700
We--

583
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:05,340
We just want to keep everyone informed.

584
00:49:05,570 --> 00:49:07,440
So, Archie, thanks for the drink.

585
00:49:07,670 --> 00:49:09,770
Sorry to have troubled you, folks. I'll see myself out.

586
00:49:10,010 --> 00:49:12,670
- Keep everyone informed? - So there's no panic, ma'am.

587
00:49:12,910 --> 00:49:16,240
- But isn't it a secret? - You have no idea how secret.

588
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:18,510
Why are you telling everyone?

589
00:49:19,950 --> 00:49:21,250
It's a smoke screen?

590
00:49:21,490 --> 00:49:24,120
- What? - Double bluff.

591
00:49:25,120 --> 00:49:27,790
You obviously don't know anything about intelligence work, lady.

592
00:49:28,030 --> 00:49:30,520
It's an XK Red 2 7 technique.

593
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:34,060
My father was in the Secret Service, Mr. Manfredin St.John.

594
00:49:34,300 --> 00:49:37,170
I know perfectly well that you don't keep the general public informed...

595
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:40,800
when you are debriefing K.G.B. defectors in a safe house.

596
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:42,470
You don't, huh?

597
00:49:42,710 --> 00:49:45,640
Not unless you're congenitally insane or irretrievably stupid.

598
00:49:48,150 --> 00:49:51,480
- Don't call me stupid. - Why on earth not?

599
00:49:53,220 --> 00:49:57,680
You English are so superior, aren't you?

600
00:49:57,920 --> 00:50:00,220
Would you like to know where you'd be without us...

601
00:50:00,460 --> 00:50:02,950
the old U.S. of A., to protect you?

602
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:07,530
The smallest fucking province in the Russian empire, that's what!

603
00:50:07,770 --> 00:50:10,530
So don't call me stupid, lady. Just thank me.

604
00:50:10,770 --> 00:50:13,260
Well, thank you for popping in and protecting us.

605
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:16,570
If it wasn't for us, you'd all be speaking German, singing--

606
00:50:20,380 --> 00:50:21,780
That's my brother covering for me.

607
00:50:22,010 --> 00:50:23,810
Get rid of your wife and get my necklace.

608
00:50:24,050 --> 00:50:26,280
Necklace, right. I'll think of something to get rid of her.

609
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:28,680
- Who are you talking to? - Myself, darling.

610
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:32,620
- Who was that shouting? - The brother of a friend of mine.

611
00:50:32,860 --> 00:50:34,850
- Archie, who on earth? - I don't know.

612
00:50:35,090 --> 00:50:36,860
Extraordinary. He rang the bell, I opened the door.

613
00:50:37,100 --> 00:50:39,030
- I need a drink. - Let's go to the pub.

614
00:50:39,260 --> 00:50:41,160
- What? - Let's go to the pub.

615
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:44,270
- Would you like to come, Portia? - We haven't been there in 1 5 years.

616
00:50:44,500 --> 00:50:46,330
It would be nice for Portia to see it now.

617
00:50:46,570 --> 00:50:48,200
Honestly, Archie.

618
00:50:48,440 --> 00:50:50,700
- What on earth is the matter? - I thought the picture was falling.

619
00:50:51,980 --> 00:50:54,610
- Pull yourself together. - It's all right. It's secure now.

620
00:50:54,850 --> 00:50:56,110
What's this?

621
00:50:56,350 --> 00:50:59,040
Thanks, Portia. Well done. Coming with us?

622
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:01,220
- What was that? - A kind of necklace.

623
00:51:01,450 --> 00:51:03,890
- What's going on? - Nothing, dear. Let's go.

624
00:51:04,120 --> 00:51:05,920
- Can I see that? - What?

625
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:07,850
In your hand.

626
00:51:08,090 --> 00:51:09,920
Your other hand.

627
00:51:11,500 --> 00:51:13,330
- Portia, go to your room. - Are we going to the pub?

628
00:51:13,570 --> 00:51:15,330
I can explain. I left some papers at the office.

629
00:51:15,570 --> 00:51:17,330
Now! And they sent a new girl up.

630
00:51:17,570 --> 00:51:18,930
- Oh, Archie. - Really, she's Canadian.

631
00:51:19,170 --> 00:51:23,270
- She mentioned it was her birthday. - It's lovely. Thank you.

632
00:51:26,380 --> 00:51:28,570
It's even got a ''W'' for Wendy.

633
00:51:28,810 --> 00:51:32,220
Oh, I'm so glad you like it, darling.

634
00:51:32,450 --> 00:51:35,420
It's the most beautiful thing you've ever given me.

635
00:51:41,060 --> 00:51:42,960
This isn't like you.

636
00:51:51,170 --> 00:51:55,370
- Are you fucking crazy? - Hey, I saved your ass.

637
00:51:55,610 --> 00:51:58,630
I had him right where I wanted him, you asshole!

638
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:01,310
I give you one fucking thing to do, Otto.

639
00:52:01,550 --> 00:52:03,450
You're supposed to drive me here. Shut up!

640
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:05,510
Oh, relax.

641
00:52:16,660 --> 00:52:19,060
Hold on. It's for you.

642
00:52:25,100 --> 00:52:27,660
Not at the moment, no.

643
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:34,080
Yes, I'm not quite sure when I'll be able to get hold of that.

644
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:39,410
Yes, I do appreciate that. Yes, as soon as possible.

645
00:52:41,590 --> 00:52:44,420
Well, that would be very nice, obviously.

646
00:52:44,660 --> 00:52:47,350
So see you soon, I hope?

647
00:52:47,590 --> 00:52:49,220
Bye, Frank.

648
00:52:49,530 --> 00:52:51,790
Easy, Maggie.

649
00:52:53,100 --> 00:52:54,860
Calm down.

650
00:52:55,100 --> 00:52:58,040
Easy, girl. Easy.

651
00:53:04,810 --> 00:53:06,330
Come here.

652
00:53:06,580 --> 00:53:10,240
Smell, Maggie, smell.

653
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:12,250
Now.

654
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:16,510
Kill!

655
00:53:43,650 --> 00:53:47,140
We therefore commit its body to the ground...

656
00:53:47,390 --> 00:53:50,690
earth to earth, ashes to ashes...

657
00:53:50,920 --> 00:53:52,720
dust to dust...

658
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:55,860
in sure and certain hope of the resurrection...

659
00:53:56,090 --> 00:53:57,930
to eternal life.

660
00:54:10,410 --> 00:54:13,400
Hello, honey. What happened?

661
00:54:14,650 --> 00:54:16,640
- Nothing. - What's that?

662
00:54:17,780 --> 00:54:20,340
- Not Granny? - Not yet.

663
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:24,150
Who's it for, then?

664
00:54:24,390 --> 00:54:26,580
A fish. A Frenchman. A phone operator.

665
00:54:26,830 --> 00:54:30,230
- Friend. - A four-legged one?

666
00:54:30,460 --> 00:54:33,230
- Where's my sister? - She's in the--

667
00:54:33,470 --> 00:54:35,960
- Thank you. - Lavatory.

668
00:54:39,100 --> 00:54:42,010
- Anything? - What? No.

669
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:45,770
- Why are you here? - I'm here because I'm bored.

670
00:54:46,010 --> 00:54:48,000
Bored wandering around this God-awful city...

671
00:54:48,250 --> 00:54:51,180
shoving George's ugly pic--

672
00:54:51,420 --> 00:54:55,410
talking to a lot of snotty, stuck-up, intellectually inferior British faggots.

673
00:54:55,650 --> 00:54:57,350
Jesus, they're uptight.

674
00:54:57,590 --> 00:55:01,120
They get rigor mortis in the prime of life in this country.

675
00:55:01,360 --> 00:55:03,520
Standing there with their hair clenched.

676
00:55:06,030 --> 00:55:07,970
Counting the seconds till the week ends...

677
00:55:08,200 --> 00:55:10,400
so they can all dress up like ballerinas and...

678
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:14,070
whip themselves into a frenzy at the flat at 4.

679
00:55:14,310 --> 00:55:16,640
''2B, St.--''

680
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:18,670
To be honest...

681
00:55:18,910 --> 00:55:20,740
I hate them.

682
00:55:20,980 --> 00:55:24,880
I mean, pretending they're so fucking lawyer--

683
00:55:25,120 --> 00:55:26,880
so fucking superior...

684
00:55:27,120 --> 00:55:29,110
with those phony accents.

685
00:55:29,350 --> 00:55:31,880
Not you, Ken. You've got a beautiful speaking voice.

686
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:34,460
When it works.

687
00:55:34,690 --> 00:55:36,520
Son of a bitch!

688
00:55:41,770 --> 00:55:44,290
So, wanna have some lunch?

689
00:55:44,540 --> 00:55:46,300
- Have you heard from him? - Who?

690
00:55:46,540 --> 00:55:49,370
- Archie. - No, I have to finish my hair!

691
00:55:50,710 --> 00:55:54,580
Nothing? I'm out of here! No plans to see him?

692
00:55:55,980 --> 00:55:58,010
Okay. Bye, bro!

693
00:55:58,250 --> 00:56:00,240
Bye, Wanda!

694
00:56:02,520 --> 00:56:04,420
Oh, sorry.

695
00:56:06,690 --> 00:56:09,160
- What? - It wasn't theirs to sell.

696
00:56:09,390 --> 00:56:11,660
An old lady gave it to them to engrave. She's about 80 and dying.

697
00:56:11,900 --> 00:56:14,300
It's of great sentimental value. Somebody put it in the display cabinet.

698
00:56:14,530 --> 00:56:16,400
- That's their problem. - Not really.

699
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:19,040
- You paid for it. - They do accept their mistake.

700
00:56:19,270 --> 00:56:22,140
They're offering you this to replace it. It's three times as valuable.

701
00:56:22,370 --> 00:56:24,640
This is the nicest thing you've ever given me, which I absolutely love.

702
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:26,970
Now you want me to give it back and replace it with something vulgar.

703
00:56:27,210 --> 00:56:29,910
- I don't want you to give it back. - Well, they can't have it.

704
00:56:31,620 --> 00:56:33,980
Tell them they can't have it.

705
00:56:34,220 --> 00:56:36,550
You're the bloody barrister!

706
00:57:13,660 --> 00:57:16,350
Oh, Archie, it's beautiful.

707
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:19,330
It's just beautiful.

708
00:57:21,470 --> 00:57:23,430
Oh, my God! Look!

709
00:57:25,070 --> 00:57:27,270
Oh, Archie, it's beautiful.

710
00:57:27,510 --> 00:57:29,700
Isn't it wonderful?

711
00:57:29,940 --> 00:57:32,570
- Whose is it? - Belongs to someone at the chambers.

712
00:57:32,810 --> 00:57:34,970
And where are they?

713
00:57:35,210 --> 00:57:39,380
Hong Kong. Gone for weeks.

714
00:57:40,890 --> 00:57:42,790
Nice rug, Archie.

715
00:57:44,690 --> 00:57:46,590
May I?

716
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:51,360
- What are you doing? - The polka, I think.

717
00:57:56,070 --> 00:57:57,930
You make me feel free.

718
00:57:58,170 --> 00:57:59,660
Free?

719
00:57:59,910 --> 00:58:04,210
Do you have any idea what it's like being English?

720
00:58:04,440 --> 00:58:08,240
Being so correct all the time? Being so stifled...

721
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:11,880
by this dread of doing the wrong thing?

722
00:58:12,120 --> 00:58:13,880
Of saying to someone, ''Are you married?''

723
00:58:14,120 --> 00:58:16,140
and hearing, ''My wife left me this morning''?

724
00:58:16,390 --> 00:58:19,520
Or saying, ''Do you have children?'' And being told...

725
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:22,630
''They all burned to death on Wednesday.''

726
00:58:22,860 --> 00:58:24,950
You see, Wanda, we're all...

727
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:27,260
terrified of embarrassment.

728
00:58:27,500 --> 00:58:29,430
That's why we're so...

729
00:58:29,670 --> 00:58:31,330
dead.

730
00:58:32,300 --> 00:58:35,760
Most of my friends are dead. We have these piles of corpses to dinner.

731
00:58:37,610 --> 00:58:40,080
But you're alive, God bless you, and I want to be.

732
00:58:40,310 --> 00:58:42,640
I'm so fed up with all this.

733
00:58:44,550 --> 00:58:47,310
I want to make love with you.

734
00:58:47,550 --> 00:58:50,280
I'm a good lover. At least...

735
00:58:50,520 --> 00:58:53,180
I used to be, back in the early 1 4th century.

736
00:58:54,230 --> 00:58:56,190
Can we go to bed?

737
00:59:01,670 --> 00:59:03,030
Yeah.

738
00:59:04,770 --> 00:59:07,100
Hang on. Mind your head.

739
00:59:14,910 --> 00:59:17,310
Oh, I think I love you.

740
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:22,310
- Can I ask you a question? - Anything.

741
00:59:22,550 --> 00:59:24,890
Where's my locket?

742
00:59:25,120 --> 00:59:27,060
- I couldn't get it. - What?

743
00:59:27,290 --> 00:59:30,730
Wendy wouldn't give it back. Look, I got you this instead.

744
00:59:31,900 --> 00:59:34,190
- Like it? - No, Archie.

745
00:59:34,430 --> 00:59:36,330
I have to have mine.

746
00:59:38,370 --> 00:59:40,000
Why?

747
00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:43,230
My mother gave it to me...

748
00:59:43,480 --> 00:59:47,040
on her deathbed.

749
00:59:49,310 --> 00:59:51,410
I'm sorry. All right, darling.

750
00:59:51,650 --> 00:59:53,550
- I'll get it for you. - You promise?

751
00:59:53,790 --> 00:59:55,690
I'll think of something.

752
00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:58,450
Sex is very difficult for me...

753
00:59:58,690 --> 01:00:01,850
with somebody that I don't trust completely.

754
01:00:02,090 --> 01:00:04,530
I promise I'll get it, okay?

755
01:00:05,860 --> 01:00:07,760
I love you, Archie!

756
01:00:09,270 --> 01:00:13,290
I've loved you ever since the first second I saw you.

757
01:00:15,840 --> 01:00:17,740
- What was that? - What?

758
01:00:19,580 --> 01:00:22,010
Your brother didn't bring you here this time, did he?

759
01:00:22,250 --> 01:00:25,510
- No. - He has no idea?

760
01:00:25,750 --> 01:00:28,580
He doesn't have a clue.

761
01:00:28,850 --> 01:00:29,080
What?

762
01:00:30,220 --> 01:00:32,160
- He is so dumb. - Really?

763
01:00:32,390 --> 01:00:35,260
He thought the Gettysburg Address was where Lincoln lived.

764
01:00:39,730 --> 01:00:43,720
All those terrible lies he told about the CIA.

765
01:00:43,970 --> 01:00:45,730
So painful.

766
01:00:45,970 --> 01:00:48,000
And when he heard your daughter's name was Portia...

767
01:00:48,240 --> 01:00:50,940
he said, ''Why did they name her after a car?''

768
01:00:56,280 --> 01:00:58,770
I love the way you laugh.

769
01:00:59,020 --> 01:01:01,080
I love you. You're funny.

770
01:01:02,920 --> 01:01:07,760
How come a girl as bright as you could have a brother who's so--

771
01:01:07,990 --> 01:01:09,820
Don't call me stupid.

772
01:01:11,600 --> 01:01:13,500
Jesus Christ!

773
01:01:16,870 --> 01:01:20,130
- Come on! - Ouch!

774
01:01:22,870 --> 01:01:24,810
Come on!

775
01:01:25,040 --> 01:01:27,980
I'll deal with you later.

776
01:01:28,210 --> 01:01:29,980
What have you done with her?

777
01:01:30,220 --> 01:01:31,980
She's all right.

778
01:01:32,220 --> 01:01:34,280
Now, apologize.

779
01:01:35,520 --> 01:01:38,320
- What? - Apologize.

780
01:01:38,560 --> 01:01:42,120
- Oh, shit! - Are you totally deranged?

781
01:01:46,900 --> 01:01:50,730
You pompous, stuck-up...

782
01:01:50,970 --> 01:01:53,300
snot-nosed, English...

783
01:01:53,540 --> 01:01:55,010
giant, twerp...

784
01:01:55,240 --> 01:01:58,330
scumbag, fuck face, dick-head, asshole!

785
01:01:58,580 --> 01:02:01,170
How very interesting.

786
01:02:01,410 --> 01:02:03,180
You're a true vulgarian, aren't you?

787
01:02:03,420 --> 01:02:06,650
You're the vulgarian, you fuck! Now, apologize!

788
01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:09,910
Me to you?

789
01:02:15,290 --> 01:02:17,120
Apologize.

790
01:02:17,360 --> 01:02:19,460
All right, I apologize.

791
01:02:19,700 --> 01:02:22,060
- You're really sorry? - I'm really, really sorry.

792
01:02:22,300 --> 01:02:24,860
I apologize unreservedly.

793
01:02:25,100 --> 01:02:26,900
- You take it back? - I do. I offer...

794
01:02:27,140 --> 01:02:29,770
a complete and utter retraction.

795
01:02:30,010 --> 01:02:32,980
The imputation was totally without basis in fact...

796
01:02:33,210 --> 01:02:36,200
and was in no way fair comment and was motivated...

797
01:02:36,450 --> 01:02:38,880
purely by malice, and I deeply regret...

798
01:02:39,120 --> 01:02:42,610
any distress that my comments may have caused you or your family.

799
01:02:42,850 --> 01:02:45,650
And I hereby undertake not to repeat...

800
01:02:45,890 --> 01:02:48,720
any such slander at any time in the future.

801
01:02:50,860 --> 01:02:51,990
Okay.

802
01:04:09,670 --> 01:04:11,540
You said you loved him!

803
01:04:11,780 --> 01:04:15,180
That's right! Now, here's a multiple choice question for you.

804
01:04:15,410 --> 01:04:17,380
A: Wanda was lying.

805
01:04:17,620 --> 01:04:19,410
B: Wanda was telling the truth!

806
01:04:19,650 --> 01:04:21,780
Which one are you gonna pick?

807
01:04:22,020 --> 01:04:24,890
What was the first one? You told me you were not planning to see him.

808
01:04:25,120 --> 01:04:26,990
Because I knew you'd come along and fuck it up!

809
01:04:27,230 --> 01:04:29,690
I was dealing with something delicate.

810
01:04:29,930 --> 01:04:32,230
I'm setting up a guy who's incredibly important to us--

811
01:04:32,460 --> 01:04:34,230
who's going to tell me where the loot is...

812
01:04:34,470 --> 01:04:36,660
and if they're gonna come and arrest you-- and you come loping in...

813
01:04:36,900 --> 01:04:39,600
like Rambo without a jockstrap and dangle him out a fifth-floor window.

814
01:04:39,840 --> 01:04:41,810
Now, was that smart?

815
01:04:42,040 --> 01:04:43,870
- Okay. - Was it shrewd?

816
01:04:44,110 --> 01:04:46,670
Was it good tactics or was it stupid?

817
01:04:48,750 --> 01:04:50,610
Don't call me stupid.

818
01:04:50,850 --> 01:04:54,980
Oh, right! To call you stupid would be an insult to stupid people!

819
01:04:55,220 --> 01:04:57,550
I've known sheep that could outwit you.

820
01:04:57,790 --> 01:04:59,620
I've worn dresses with higher IQs.

821
01:04:59,860 --> 01:05:02,490
But you think you're an intellectual, don't you, ape?

822
01:05:03,830 --> 01:05:05,760
Apes don't read philosophy.

823
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:09,260
Yes, they do. They just don't understand it.

824
01:05:09,500 --> 01:05:12,530
Now, let me correct you on a couple things, okay?

825
01:05:12,770 --> 01:05:15,470
Aristotle was not Belgian.

826
01:05:15,710 --> 01:05:19,640
The central message of Buddhism is not ''Every man for himself.''

827
01:05:19,880 --> 01:05:22,710
And the London Underground is not a political movement.

828
01:05:22,950 --> 01:05:25,510
Those are all mistakes. I looked 'em up.

829
01:05:26,520 --> 01:05:29,490
Now, you have just assaulted...

830
01:05:29,720 --> 01:05:32,820
the one man who can keep you out of jail and make you rich.

831
01:05:33,060 --> 01:05:35,390
So what are you gonna do about it?

832
01:05:35,630 --> 01:05:38,120
What would an intellectual do?

833
01:05:38,360 --> 01:05:40,390
What would Plato do?

834
01:05:44,600 --> 01:05:46,330
- Apologize. - Pardon me?

835
01:05:48,110 --> 01:05:50,010
What?

836
01:05:50,240 --> 01:05:52,140
- Apologize! - Right!

837
01:05:53,950 --> 01:05:56,180
I'm sorry.

838
01:05:56,410 --> 01:06:00,350
No. Not to me, to Archie.

839
01:06:00,590 --> 01:06:02,850
And make it good or we're dead.

840
01:06:09,560 --> 01:06:11,960
I'm so very, very--

841
01:06:13,930 --> 01:06:16,420
Fuck you!

842
01:06:18,700 --> 01:06:22,100
I'm very, very sss--

843
01:06:41,030 --> 01:06:42,930
Very, very--

844
01:07:57,270 --> 01:08:01,330
Hello, Mr. Burglar. Going somewhere?

845
01:08:01,570 --> 01:08:04,770
Thought you could rob Mr. Leach, eh? Well, I'm gonna teach you a lesson.

846
01:08:05,010 --> 01:08:07,810
He just happens to be a very good friend of mine...

847
01:08:08,050 --> 01:08:11,170
and he's going to be very pleased with me when he finds you...

848
01:08:11,420 --> 01:08:14,680
all tied up and ready for the police.

849
01:08:16,720 --> 01:08:20,380
And don't call me Otto. To you, I am Mr.--

850
01:08:30,970 --> 01:08:32,370
Oh, my God!

851
01:08:35,410 --> 01:08:37,310
I'm sorry.

852
01:08:39,410 --> 01:08:42,040
Please. I'm sorry.

853
01:08:43,010 --> 01:08:44,850
I didn't know it was you.

854
01:08:45,080 --> 01:08:46,950
How could I know it was you?

855
01:08:47,190 --> 01:08:49,980
I mean, how could you expect me to guess?

856
01:08:50,220 --> 01:08:52,820
You stupid jerk. What the fuck are you doing...

857
01:08:53,060 --> 01:08:54,820
robbing your own house?

858
01:08:55,060 --> 01:08:56,820
You asshole!

859
01:08:57,060 --> 01:08:59,460
You stupid, stiff, pompous, English--

860
01:09:01,600 --> 01:09:03,500
I'm sorry.

861
01:09:50,250 --> 01:09:51,650
God almighty!

862
01:09:53,050 --> 01:09:54,950
Bloody hell!

863
01:10:02,360 --> 01:10:04,230
Darling!

864
01:10:04,460 --> 01:10:06,230
Are you hurt?

865
01:10:06,460 --> 01:10:08,730
Speak to me. Are you hurt?

866
01:10:10,100 --> 01:10:12,000
Can't you speak?

867
01:10:13,040 --> 01:10:14,940
What has happened?

868
01:10:17,110 --> 01:10:19,440
Archie, we've been burgled.

869
01:10:19,680 --> 01:10:21,650
- Oh, no! - Well, are you hurt?

870
01:10:21,880 --> 01:10:24,250
No, I'm fine. Bit of a headache.

871
01:10:24,480 --> 01:10:28,040
I came in here. Somebody hit me, tied me up with a--

872
01:10:28,290 --> 01:10:29,620
My God, is that the time?

873
01:10:29,850 --> 01:10:31,620
What?

874
01:10:31,860 --> 01:10:34,190
- I didn't realize it was quite so late. - What?

875
01:10:34,430 --> 01:10:37,160
- I'm late for a conference. - A conference?

876
01:10:37,400 --> 01:10:40,360
- You've just been attacked! - It's nothing. I must fly. Sorry.

877
01:10:40,600 --> 01:10:43,530
I'll help you tidy up when I get back. Hello, Portia.

878
01:10:43,770 --> 01:10:45,960
What's happened?

879
01:10:46,200 --> 01:10:50,070
Your father has finally gone completely mental.

880
01:11:30,250 --> 01:11:32,080
Thank you so much.

881
01:11:32,320 --> 01:11:34,310
- Champagne? - Okay.

882
01:11:57,440 --> 01:11:59,340
To us.

883
01:12:02,150 --> 01:12:05,170
Well, I went back to the house and guess who--

884
01:12:05,420 --> 01:12:07,980
Let's make love.

885
01:12:08,220 --> 01:12:10,190
Well, if you absolutely insist.

886
01:12:10,420 --> 01:12:12,290
- No. - What?

887
01:12:12,520 --> 01:12:14,350
Here on the rug.

888
01:12:15,660 --> 01:12:18,420
I'll be right back. Get undressed.

889
01:12:20,260 --> 01:12:22,360
Why not?

890
01:12:22,600 --> 01:12:24,430
Why not indeed.

891
01:12:26,640 --> 01:12:29,630
- Afterwards-- - Yeah?

892
01:12:29,870 --> 01:12:31,640
Let's go to South America.

893
01:12:31,880 --> 01:12:34,900
- What? - Let's fly to South America.

894
01:12:35,150 --> 01:12:36,580
Why South America?

895
01:12:36,810 --> 01:12:39,580
Okay, Iceland.

896
01:12:42,490 --> 01:12:45,080
What do you really want out of life?

897
01:12:45,320 --> 01:12:46,980
I don't know.

898
01:12:47,220 --> 01:12:49,020
Why do I like you so much?

899
01:12:51,260 --> 01:12:52,990
Do you speak Italian?

900
01:12:53,230 --> 01:12:55,060
I am Italian!

901
01:13:05,380 --> 01:13:07,710
But it's such an ugly language.

902
01:13:07,950 --> 01:13:10,540
How about Russian?

903
01:13:40,540 --> 01:13:43,640
- Are you rich? - No, I'm afraid not.

904
01:13:43,880 --> 01:13:46,870
- What about the house? - That's Wendy's. She's the rich one.

905
01:14:31,830 --> 01:14:35,890
- What the hell are you doing? - I might ask you the same question.

906
01:14:37,370 --> 01:14:38,600
Who are you?

907
01:14:38,840 --> 01:14:40,600
- What? - Get your clothes on.

908
01:14:40,840 --> 01:14:43,600
- Will you leave immediately, please? - What?

909
01:14:43,840 --> 01:14:45,740
You're in the wrong flat.

910
01:14:45,980 --> 01:14:47,910
This flat belongs to Patrick Balfour.

911
01:14:48,150 --> 01:14:51,210
He's in Hong Kong. He lent me the key. Now, get out!

912
01:14:51,450 --> 01:14:54,440
But we leased it from the agents last weekend.

913
01:15:00,220 --> 01:15:03,820
Yes, well, obviously that changes things a bit.

914
01:15:05,230 --> 01:15:08,260
Aren't you Archie Leach?

915
01:15:08,500 --> 01:15:09,560
What?

916
01:15:09,800 --> 01:15:12,890
You bought our house in Lissendon Gardens.

917
01:15:13,140 --> 01:15:16,200
Hazel and Ian Johnson.

918
01:15:18,180 --> 01:15:20,540
What a coincidence!

919
01:15:22,250 --> 01:15:24,150
How nice to see you.

920
01:15:54,010 --> 01:15:58,280
- Hello? - Wanda, it's Archie. Listen.

921
01:15:58,520 --> 01:16:02,280
I can't see you anymore. I've got to end it. I'm sorry.

922
01:16:02,520 --> 01:16:04,010
What?

923
01:16:05,360 --> 01:16:06,910
I'm sorry.

924
01:16:43,090 --> 01:16:45,580
- Okay. - Oh, no. Please.

925
01:16:45,830 --> 01:16:48,700
- Look, I want to apologize. - I just finished it, all right?

926
01:16:48,930 --> 01:16:50,960
Okay, just-- Wait. Where are you going?

927
01:16:51,200 --> 01:16:54,730
I just ended it, for Christ's sake! Will you leave me alone?

928
01:16:54,970 --> 01:16:57,070
- I've just ended it, all right? - Wait!

929
01:16:57,310 --> 01:17:00,400
- I just want to say I'm sorry. - It's all over!

930
01:17:00,640 --> 01:17:04,410
-Jesus Christ! Someone help me! - Will you calm down?

931
01:17:05,980 --> 01:17:08,350
Please, believe me. Don't beat me up again.

932
01:17:08,590 --> 01:17:10,380
I've had a terrible day.

933
01:17:10,620 --> 01:17:13,650
- Will you shut up? -Jesus Christ! Don't kill me, please.

934
01:17:13,890 --> 01:17:17,380
Shut up then. Okay.

935
01:17:17,630 --> 01:17:20,560
Look, I just wanna apologize...

936
01:17:20,800 --> 01:17:24,600
sincerely for when I dangled you out the window.

937
01:17:24,840 --> 01:17:28,600
I'm really, really-- Well, it was not a nice thing to do.

938
01:17:28,840 --> 01:17:32,940
And then when I attacked you in there, well, I'm really--

939
01:17:33,180 --> 01:17:35,910
How could I know you were trying to rob your own house?

940
01:17:36,150 --> 01:17:39,480
- I was just trying to help. - Yes. Thanks.

941
01:17:39,720 --> 01:17:43,710
- I wanted you to trust me. - Please, it was my fault.

942
01:17:43,950 --> 01:17:45,720
- That's true. - Yeah.

943
01:17:45,960 --> 01:17:48,150
Now, about my sister.

944
01:17:48,390 --> 01:17:50,260
She's a very sexy girl.

945
01:17:50,490 --> 01:17:52,290
I understand you wanting to play around with her.

946
01:17:52,530 --> 01:17:54,760
It's okay. I was wrong.

947
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:57,590
I'm sorry I was jealous. Just go ahead.

948
01:17:57,840 --> 01:18:01,270
Pork away, pal. Fuck her blue.

949
01:18:01,510 --> 01:18:05,370
I like you, Archie. I just wanna help.

950
01:19:11,480 --> 01:19:12,940
Oh, God!

951
01:20:17,810 --> 01:20:19,210
I did it.

952
01:20:19,440 --> 01:20:21,310
I did it! Lovely!

953
01:20:21,550 --> 01:20:24,540
Unbe-fucking-lieveable!

954
01:20:24,780 --> 01:20:26,770
Thomason!

955
01:20:30,620 --> 01:20:32,590
You've done well, my son.

956
01:20:33,660 --> 01:20:35,490
Now, here's the plan.

957
01:20:35,730 --> 01:20:38,890
You get four tickets this evening for Rio, first class.

958
01:20:39,130 --> 01:20:40,960
Then--

959
01:20:42,070 --> 01:20:44,470
Yeah, four. We get rid of Otto later.

960
01:20:44,700 --> 01:20:47,570
Then, back to the flat. Pack, collect me.

961
01:20:47,800 --> 01:20:51,170
Then to the Cathcart Towers Hotel to pick up the jewels.

962
01:20:54,480 --> 01:20:58,540
Unbe-fucking-lievable!

963
01:21:03,920 --> 01:21:06,580
Oh, it's so exciting. I can't believe it.

964
01:21:06,820 --> 01:21:08,590
He's safe.

965
01:21:08,830 --> 01:21:10,850
Oh, I'm going to be late for court.

966
01:21:13,960 --> 01:21:15,930
Hello? Oh, hello, Otto.

967
01:21:18,940 --> 01:21:21,530
No, she just left.

968
01:21:21,770 --> 01:21:25,500
And, Otto, you owe me a--

969
01:21:28,510 --> 01:21:30,410
What?

970
01:21:30,650 --> 01:21:33,140
You owe me a pound.

971
01:21:34,920 --> 01:21:36,890
Not Granny?

972
01:21:37,120 --> 01:21:41,650
Met with an accident.

973
01:21:41,890 --> 01:21:44,920
- Bullshit! You're lying! - Come on.

974
01:21:45,160 --> 01:21:46,190
Dead?

975
01:21:47,460 --> 01:21:49,360
Heart attack.

976
01:21:53,170 --> 01:21:55,000
I don't believe this.

977
01:21:55,240 --> 01:21:57,760
George'll be out this afternoon.

978
01:21:58,010 --> 01:22:00,700
We'll all go out to Heathrow, collect the loot, and then--

979
01:22:02,880 --> 01:22:06,010
All thanks...

980
01:22:06,250 --> 01:22:09,480
to me.

981
01:22:09,720 --> 01:22:12,120
So, the loot's at the airport, is it, Ken?

982
01:22:22,730 --> 01:22:24,630
What's happening?

983
01:22:25,870 --> 01:22:28,000
Well, Ken...

984
01:22:28,240 --> 01:22:31,570
I'm going to ask you some questions while I eat my chips.

985
01:22:32,540 --> 01:22:34,840
First, who is the philosopher...

986
01:22:35,080 --> 01:22:37,570
who developed the concept of the ''superman''...

987
01:22:37,810 --> 01:22:40,210
in Also sprach Zarathustra?

988
01:22:42,650 --> 01:22:43,710
No?

989
01:22:43,950 --> 01:22:46,390
That's a chip up the nose, I'm afraid.

990
01:22:48,090 --> 01:22:50,720
Friedrich Nietzsche. Next.

991
01:22:50,960 --> 01:22:53,160
In which book did Nietzsche claim...

992
01:22:53,400 --> 01:22:56,590
that almost all higher culture is based on cruelty?

993
01:22:59,500 --> 01:23:01,330
Are you thinking, or are you in mid-stutter?

994
01:23:01,570 --> 01:23:04,940
You're mad.

995
01:23:05,180 --> 01:23:07,340
Beyond Good and Evil.

996
01:23:09,010 --> 01:23:11,240
I guess I'll have to ask you an easy one, huh?

997
01:23:11,480 --> 01:23:12,950
Okay, um--

998
01:23:13,180 --> 01:23:15,410
Let me think.

999
01:23:15,650 --> 01:23:19,920
Where are the diamonds? I'll give you a clue.

1000
01:23:20,160 --> 01:23:23,130
Somewhere around the airport.

1001
01:23:24,360 --> 01:23:27,800
- I'm n-- - No hassle. There's plenty of time.

1002
01:23:28,030 --> 01:23:31,630
I'll just sit here and eat my chips until you tell me.

1003
01:23:34,100 --> 01:23:38,670
The English contribution to world cuisine: the chip.

1004
01:23:39,980 --> 01:23:42,600
What do the English usually eat with chips...

1005
01:23:42,850 --> 01:23:45,580
to make them more interesting?

1006
01:23:45,820 --> 01:23:47,650
Wait a moment!

1007
01:23:49,450 --> 01:23:51,350
It's fish, isn't it?

1008
01:23:57,130 --> 01:23:59,250
Here, boy. Down the hatch.

1009
01:24:04,200 --> 01:24:05,230
Delicious.

1010
01:24:05,470 --> 01:24:07,800
You b--

1011
01:24:08,040 --> 01:24:10,600
Better eat the green one? Okay.

1012
01:24:10,840 --> 01:24:12,900
What's this one's name?

1013
01:24:13,140 --> 01:24:15,240
Well, not Wanda, anyway.

1014
01:24:15,480 --> 01:24:17,110
I'm going to call her Lunch.

1015
01:24:17,350 --> 01:24:19,180
Hello, Lunch.

1016
01:24:26,490 --> 01:24:28,360
Avoid the green ones.

1017
01:24:28,590 --> 01:24:30,420
They're not ripe yet.

1018
01:24:31,830 --> 01:24:34,160
Now, you were in court, were you not, Inspector...

1019
01:24:34,400 --> 01:24:36,420
when the forensic evidence was read?

1020
01:24:36,670 --> 01:24:38,430
- Yes, sir. - And the fact that...

1021
01:24:38,670 --> 01:24:41,830
Mr. Thomason was installing windows the previous weekend...

1022
01:24:42,070 --> 01:24:43,840
would account, would it not...

1023
01:24:44,070 --> 01:24:48,810
for the presence of small particles of glass on his trousers?

1024
01:24:51,310 --> 01:24:53,780
No hurry, Inspector. Please do take your time.

1025
01:25:01,790 --> 01:25:03,690
I'm almost full.

1026
01:25:05,600 --> 01:25:07,890
- Almost. - Stop!

1027
01:25:08,130 --> 01:25:10,120
Please, don't.

1028
01:25:10,370 --> 01:25:13,700
Come on, Wanda. Gullet time.

1029
01:25:16,670 --> 01:25:19,110
What are the names of those hotels that are right by the airport?

1030
01:25:19,340 --> 01:25:23,710
What are they? The Airway Sheraton, The Post House, The Cathcart Towers--

1031
01:25:23,950 --> 01:25:26,420
The Cathcart Towers? Yes?

1032
01:25:30,590 --> 01:25:33,420
- Yes. - In a safe deposit box?

1033
01:25:33,660 --> 01:25:34,650
Yes.

1034
01:25:36,530 --> 01:25:38,760
- What? - Where's the key?

1035
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:41,160
It's in the tank.

1036
01:25:43,270 --> 01:25:44,730
Where?

1037
01:25:44,970 --> 01:25:48,340
- In the t-- - Treasure chest!

1038
01:25:53,480 --> 01:25:55,100
Where?

1039
01:26:00,450 --> 01:26:03,040
You m-m--

1040
01:26:03,290 --> 01:26:05,120
murdering--

1041
01:26:06,790 --> 01:26:09,160
I'll kill you!

1042
01:26:12,130 --> 01:26:15,530
Sorry, Ken, but your answer was incorrect.

1043
01:26:16,600 --> 01:26:19,630
Still, you really did think it was in there, didn't you?

1044
01:26:21,470 --> 01:26:22,870
What?

1045
01:26:32,720 --> 01:26:33,610
Hello?

1046
01:26:33,850 --> 01:26:37,790
- I know where the diamonds are. - Where?

1047
01:26:38,020 --> 01:26:39,450
Where's the key?

1048
01:26:42,830 --> 01:26:44,290
I've got it.

1049
01:26:44,530 --> 01:26:46,930
How soon can you get to George's apartment?

1050
01:26:48,230 --> 01:26:51,790
You are Wanda Gershwitz of Kipling Mansions...

1051
01:26:52,040 --> 01:26:54,330
Murray Road, London, West Nine?

1052
01:26:55,440 --> 01:26:58,170
- Yes. - Will you tell the court, please...

1053
01:26:58,410 --> 01:27:00,670
how do you know the defendant?

1054
01:27:00,910 --> 01:27:03,400
We've had a relationship for two years.

1055
01:27:04,410 --> 01:27:06,040
Relationship?

1056
01:27:07,280 --> 01:27:09,180
We're lovers, your lord.

1057
01:27:10,820 --> 01:27:15,050
Miss Gershwitz, on the fourth of March of this year...

1058
01:27:15,290 --> 01:27:17,350
in the morning, where were you?

1059
01:27:17,590 --> 01:27:19,360
I was at the apartment at Murray Road.

1060
01:27:19,600 --> 01:27:22,930
And were you by yourself or was there anyone else present?

1061
01:27:23,170 --> 01:27:25,360
No, somebody else was there.

1062
01:27:25,600 --> 01:27:28,540
- Who was that? - My brother.

1063
01:27:28,770 --> 01:27:30,670
And did your--

1064
01:27:34,080 --> 01:27:35,910
Your brother?

1065
01:27:38,280 --> 01:27:39,750
My brother.

1066
01:27:41,350 --> 01:27:42,910
Yes.

1067
01:27:44,820 --> 01:27:46,950
And--

1068
01:27:47,190 --> 01:27:49,220
Are you quite sure it was your brother?

1069
01:27:49,460 --> 01:27:52,950
Mr. Leach, I'm sure Miss Gershwitz can recognize her brother.

1070
01:27:53,200 --> 01:27:55,030
She's had a relationship with him all her life.

1071
01:27:57,300 --> 01:27:59,430
Much obliged, my lord.

1072
01:27:59,670 --> 01:28:04,040
Was there anyone else present that morning?

1073
01:28:04,270 --> 01:28:06,040
- Yes, George was there. - Thank you.

1074
01:28:06,280 --> 01:28:08,570
- But he left about five to 7:00. - Wanda.

1075
01:28:09,910 --> 01:28:12,250
I wonder--

1076
01:28:26,600 --> 01:28:28,530
Yes, Mr. Leach?

1077
01:28:28,770 --> 01:28:31,330
I Wendy-- I Wanda-- I wonder--

1078
01:28:31,570 --> 01:28:36,970
When you say five to 7:00, Miss Gershwitz...

1079
01:28:38,610 --> 01:28:40,440
how can you be so sure?

1080
01:28:40,680 --> 01:28:44,740
Oh, I looked at the clock, 'cause I was saying to myself...

1081
01:28:44,980 --> 01:28:47,780
''Where could he be going at five to 7:00 with that sawed-off shotgun?''

1082
01:28:48,020 --> 01:28:49,850
Darling!

1083
01:28:50,090 --> 01:28:54,050
- Mr. Leach. ''Darling''? - Yes, dear?

1084
01:28:54,290 --> 01:28:56,820
You bitch! You fucking bitch!

1085
01:29:01,460 --> 01:29:03,360
Restrain that man.

1086
01:29:08,770 --> 01:29:12,260
- Restrain this man. - Come here, you bastard!

1087
01:29:12,510 --> 01:29:14,480
Clear the court. I'm adjourning this matter for now.

1088
01:29:14,710 --> 01:29:16,840
- Take the prisoner below. - Clear the court!

1089
01:29:30,290 --> 01:29:32,590
Officers, arrest that man!

1090
01:29:38,400 --> 01:29:40,890
Clear the court!

1091
01:29:52,250 --> 01:29:53,910
Bloody hell!

1092
01:29:55,250 --> 01:29:57,950
It's my husband. He's been hit.

1093
01:29:58,190 --> 01:30:01,650
You made it. Good. Bit of a knock, I'm afraid.

1094
01:30:02,960 --> 01:30:05,890
I have never been so humiliated in my life.

1095
01:30:06,130 --> 01:30:09,330
You can stick this marriage right in your bottom.

1096
01:30:09,570 --> 01:30:11,400
I'll see you in court.

1097
01:30:20,780 --> 01:30:22,340
Yes.

1098
01:30:23,850 --> 01:30:27,410
Well, that's it, then.

1099
01:30:32,460 --> 01:30:34,580
- What? - We've got to talk.

1100
01:30:34,820 --> 01:30:37,320
You tell those pigs to fuck off!

1101
01:30:37,560 --> 01:30:39,460
Fuck off, pigs.

1102
01:30:41,660 --> 01:30:44,360
Did you hear what I said? Fuck off.

1103
01:30:50,470 --> 01:30:53,170
- What's she up to, George? - What are you up to?

1104
01:30:53,410 --> 01:30:57,350
You called her darling and Wanda.

1105
01:30:57,580 --> 01:30:59,950
I've been helping her get her evidence straight.

1106
01:31:00,180 --> 01:31:02,850
- It slipped out. - You've been coaching her?

1107
01:31:03,090 --> 01:31:05,490
What do you think? Look, we've got ten minutes.

1108
01:31:05,720 --> 01:31:07,490
They're gonna find you guilty, right?

1109
01:31:07,720 --> 01:31:09,490
If you plead guilty now, tell them where the loot is...

1110
01:31:09,730 --> 01:31:12,820
you may get away with eight years, out in five-and-a-half.

1111
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:16,470
What if I tell them about Otto and Wanda?

1112
01:31:17,570 --> 01:31:19,400
- They both did it? - Yeah.

1113
01:31:19,640 --> 01:31:21,900
Great. All right. Maybe six years, out in four.

1114
01:31:22,840 --> 01:31:24,830
So where are the diamonds?

1115
01:31:26,080 --> 01:31:28,670
- Where's Bartlett? - Upstairs trying to calm things down.

1116
01:31:28,910 --> 01:31:30,610
So, where are they?

1117
01:31:30,850 --> 01:31:33,180
Tell Bartlett Ken knows where they are.

1118
01:31:36,290 --> 01:31:39,190
It'd be a lot quicker if you told me.

1119
01:31:40,690 --> 01:31:44,320
Okay, I'll tell Bartlett. Where's Ken?

1120
01:31:44,560 --> 01:31:46,390
He's at the flat.

1121
01:31:52,200 --> 01:31:55,000
Thank you for all your help. I'll be right out.

1122
01:32:09,990 --> 01:32:12,420
Taxi! Please! Shit.

1123
01:32:14,290 --> 01:32:15,690
- Come on. - What?

1124
01:32:15,930 --> 01:32:17,120
- Let's go. - Where?

1125
01:32:17,360 --> 01:32:18,760
- Buenos Aires. - What?

1126
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:22,900
We're going to George's flat first. Get in.

1127
01:32:26,370 --> 01:32:28,230
- Got your passport? - Yeah.

1128
01:32:28,470 --> 01:32:30,500
Check the briefcase for mine.

1129
01:32:30,740 --> 01:32:32,570
Get your head down.

1130
01:32:37,980 --> 01:32:39,970
So you robbed the jewelers...

1131
01:32:40,220 --> 01:32:42,010
turned one of your lovers over to the police...

1132
01:32:42,250 --> 01:32:44,350
kept the other one on to help you find the diamonds...

1133
01:32:44,590 --> 01:32:47,110
and when he does, you commit perjury in the High Court, right?

1134
01:32:47,360 --> 01:32:49,330
Come on, Archie. Everybody does it in America.

1135
01:32:49,560 --> 01:32:51,320
Well, not in this country, they don't!

1136
01:32:51,560 --> 01:32:54,430
Oh, right. Like nobody lies in England. Like Margaret Thatcher never lied.

1137
01:32:54,660 --> 01:32:56,530
Look, you lied to me right from the moment we met.

1138
01:32:56,770 --> 01:32:59,360
- You just wanted to get me into bed. - I fell in love with you.

1139
01:33:05,880 --> 01:33:08,440
How come you dumped me then?

1140
01:33:08,680 --> 01:33:11,240
I wasn't rich enough, remember?

1141
01:33:22,960 --> 01:33:25,190
- Say something in Russian. - No.

1142
01:33:30,170 --> 01:33:32,000
What are you thinking?

1143
01:33:32,240 --> 01:33:34,000
I'm just trying to think of one good reason why...

1144
01:33:34,240 --> 01:33:36,730
I should take you to South America with me.

1145
01:33:36,970 --> 01:33:38,840
How about...

1146
01:33:39,080 --> 01:33:41,770
because I have the key to the safety deposit box.

1147
01:33:43,310 --> 01:33:45,210
That's a good reason.

1148
01:33:49,450 --> 01:33:50,890
- What do we do about Otto? - I'll handle Otto.

1149
01:33:51,920 --> 01:33:55,820
- Be careful. He's dangerous. - So am I.

1150
01:33:56,860 --> 01:33:58,760
Keep it running.

1151
01:34:01,430 --> 01:34:03,260
- Why did you bring him? - Otto, just wait!

1152
01:34:03,500 --> 01:34:05,760
I'm beginning to think you like that fruit.

1153
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:07,770
Let's get the diamonds!

1154
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:08,940
Ken?

1155
01:34:09,840 --> 01:34:11,670
Are you Ken?

1156
01:34:13,510 --> 01:34:16,950
How do you do? I'm George's barrister.

1157
01:34:17,180 --> 01:34:19,580
What's happened?

1158
01:34:19,820 --> 01:34:22,050
- Oh, my God! - Asshole!

1159
01:34:22,290 --> 01:34:23,950
What the bloody hell do you think--

1160
01:34:25,120 --> 01:34:27,680
All right, then.

1161
01:34:31,290 --> 01:34:32,960
Where have they gone? Quick.

1162
01:34:36,500 --> 01:34:38,130
What?

1163
01:34:39,400 --> 01:34:41,670
Are you all right?

1164
01:34:41,900 --> 01:34:45,200
- Where have they gone? - They've gone to the Cathcart--

1165
01:34:45,440 --> 01:34:46,970
- Are you ill? - No, no.

1166
01:34:47,210 --> 01:34:48,800
What?

1167
01:34:49,050 --> 01:34:50,810
Have you got a stutter?

1168
01:34:51,050 --> 01:34:52,780
Yeah.

1169
01:34:53,020 --> 01:34:54,780
- A bit. - Okay, fine. Don't worry.

1170
01:34:55,020 --> 01:34:57,510
Do you know where they've gone?

1171
01:34:57,750 --> 01:34:59,650
Fine. Where?

1172
01:35:01,020 --> 01:35:04,290
The Ca-- Hotel.

1173
01:35:04,530 --> 01:35:07,020
Hotel? Which hotel?

1174
01:35:12,640 --> 01:35:15,800
Go on. It's okay.

1175
01:35:16,040 --> 01:35:18,840
All right. Wait.

1176
01:35:19,080 --> 01:35:21,170
Slowly. Very slowly.

1177
01:35:34,360 --> 01:35:36,260
No hurry.

1178
01:35:37,630 --> 01:35:39,530
Sing it.

1179
01:35:47,470 --> 01:35:49,230
Plenty of time.

1180
01:35:52,880 --> 01:35:55,900
Oh, come on! I'm sorry.

1181
01:35:58,110 --> 01:35:59,670
Wait.

1182
01:36:03,220 --> 01:36:05,120
Here, write it.

1183
01:36:16,470 --> 01:36:19,160
Cathcart Towers Hotel?

1184
01:36:19,400 --> 01:36:21,230
Where is it?

1185
01:36:25,810 --> 01:36:27,710
Here, again.

1186
01:36:35,950 --> 01:36:37,110
Heathrow Airport.

1187
01:36:48,900 --> 01:36:50,890
Hey! What's the idea?

1188
01:36:51,130 --> 01:36:52,900
- You can't stay there. - Frightfully sorry.

1189
01:36:53,140 --> 01:36:54,830
Take it. It's yours.

1190
01:37:02,180 --> 01:37:05,270
Thank you so much. British Airways to Rio?

1191
01:37:05,520 --> 01:37:07,280
Rio. Terminal four, sir.

1192
01:37:07,520 --> 01:37:08,980
Thank you.

1193
01:37:15,190 --> 01:37:17,020
Excuse me, sir, is this your vehicle?

1194
01:37:17,260 --> 01:37:20,720
I'll be with you in a moment. I'll be right back.

1195
01:37:21,260 --> 01:37:24,130
Aisle or window? Smoking or non-smoking?

1196
01:37:24,370 --> 01:37:27,000
- What was the middle one? - Anything in non-smoking is fine.

1197
01:37:27,240 --> 01:37:29,070
Gate 1 4 is boarding now.

1198
01:37:52,460 --> 01:37:53,660
Rio!

1199
01:37:54,960 --> 01:37:57,630
Don't look back. There's a cop right behind us.

1200
01:37:57,870 --> 01:37:59,360
Quick.

1201
01:38:03,410 --> 01:38:06,240
- Yes, we can just do it, Mr. Leach. - Great.

1202
01:38:06,480 --> 01:38:08,170
Luggage?

1203
01:38:11,310 --> 01:38:13,150
Don't really need any.

1204
01:38:13,380 --> 01:38:14,820
- Gate 1 4. - Thank you.

1205
01:38:49,190 --> 01:38:52,620
Come on, Archie. Pick up the phone.

1206
01:38:59,030 --> 01:39:01,260
Wait, sir. Airport Security.

1207
01:39:01,500 --> 01:39:04,360
- May I see your boarding pass, please? - Oh, yes, certainly.

1208
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:08,970
Very good. Now, would you mind stepping over here please?

1209
01:39:09,210 --> 01:39:10,700
- Oh, look, the Queen. - Where?

1210
01:39:16,910 --> 01:39:18,810
Okay. Don't get excited.

1211
01:39:22,950 --> 01:39:25,480
Oh, it's you. I was actually worried there for a minute.

1212
01:39:25,720 --> 01:39:27,350
- Keep your hands up. - No!

1213
01:39:27,590 --> 01:39:29,460
- Put 'em up! - I'll make a deal with you.

1214
01:39:29,690 --> 01:39:33,320
- I'll put one up. - Put the other one up!

1215
01:39:34,400 --> 01:39:36,760
Which looks better?

1216
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:39,590
I'm warning you, Otto.

1217
01:39:39,840 --> 01:39:41,890
What are you gonna do, shoot me?

1218
01:39:42,140 --> 01:39:44,610
Gun me down in cold blood like a dog?

1219
01:39:44,840 --> 01:39:47,640
If you wanna settle something with me, then why don't you fight me?

1220
01:39:47,880 --> 01:39:50,810
You're a man, aren't you? Then let's fight like men. Come on!

1221
01:39:52,280 --> 01:39:53,610
All right.

1222
01:39:53,850 --> 01:39:56,780
- All right, then. - Okay.

1223
01:39:58,690 --> 01:40:00,660
- You look good, Arch. - That's right.

1224
01:40:00,890 --> 01:40:02,860
- I used to box for Oxford. - Oh, yeah?

1225
01:40:03,090 --> 01:40:06,150
I used to kill for the CIA. Now, get your hands up.

1226
01:40:12,130 --> 01:40:14,260
You spineless bimbo.

1227
01:40:14,500 --> 01:40:16,530
Now, out.

1228
01:40:20,780 --> 01:40:22,970
I'm gonna have to shoot you now.

1229
01:40:23,210 --> 01:40:25,910
But I've got a little time before my plane leaves...

1230
01:40:26,150 --> 01:40:28,050
and I'm longing to humiliate you.

1231
01:40:28,280 --> 01:40:30,120
So get in that barrel.

1232
01:40:32,620 --> 01:40:34,050
- What? - In the barrel.

1233
01:40:38,490 --> 01:40:40,050
Right.

1234
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:46,230
You English. You think you're so superior, don't you?

1235
01:40:46,470 --> 01:40:48,900
Well, you're the filth of the planet.

1236
01:40:49,140 --> 01:40:52,340
A bunch of pompous, badly dressed...

1237
01:40:52,580 --> 01:40:55,040
poverty-stricken, sexually repressed...

1238
01:40:55,280 --> 01:40:57,540
football hooligans.

1239
01:40:58,650 --> 01:41:00,110
Good-bye, Archie.

1240
01:41:00,350 --> 01:41:02,750
Well, at least we're not irretrievably vulgar.

1241
01:41:02,990 --> 01:41:05,350
You know your problem? You don't like winners.

1242
01:41:05,590 --> 01:41:08,080
- Winners? - Yeah. Winners.

1243
01:41:08,320 --> 01:41:10,690
Winners, like North Vietnam?

1244
01:41:10,930 --> 01:41:12,550
Shut up!

1245
01:41:12,800 --> 01:41:15,200
We did not lose Vietnam. It was a tie.

1246
01:41:15,430 --> 01:41:18,230
I'm telling ya, baby, they kicked your little ass there.

1247
01:41:18,470 --> 01:41:23,100
Boy, they whooped your hide real good.

1248
01:41:23,340 --> 01:41:25,360
- No, they didn't.

1249
01:41:25,610 --> 01:41:28,130
- Yes, they did.

1250
01:41:28,380 --> 01:41:29,970
No

1251
01:41:30,210 --> 01:41:31,910
Shut up!

1252
01:41:32,150 --> 01:41:34,550
- Good-bye, Archie. - You gonna shoot me?

1253
01:41:34,780 --> 01:41:38,190
Yes, afraid so, old chap. Sorry.

1254
01:41:38,420 --> 01:41:40,050
Look, Otto!

1255
01:41:47,860 --> 01:41:49,690
Revenge!

1256
01:41:53,600 --> 01:41:56,630
It's Ken coming to kill me.

1257
01:41:57,970 --> 01:42:01,430
How are you gonna catch me, Ken?

1258
01:42:04,080 --> 01:42:06,210
Now, where was I? Oh, yeah.

1259
01:42:08,820 --> 01:42:11,480
Shit! God--

1260
01:42:11,720 --> 01:42:14,090
Fucking limey cement.

1261
01:42:24,530 --> 01:42:25,900
Wait!

1262
01:42:26,140 --> 01:42:28,400
Kenny! May I call you Kenny?

1263
01:42:28,640 --> 01:42:30,940
- Remember Wanda! - I've got the deal of a lifetime.

1264
01:42:31,170 --> 01:42:32,940
Fifty-fifty. You and me. What do you say?

1265
01:42:33,180 --> 01:42:35,200
Okay, sixty-forty.

1266
01:42:35,440 --> 01:42:37,910
- That's my final offer. - Revenge!

1267
01:42:38,150 --> 01:42:41,170
I've got an idea. You take it all. Yeah.

1268
01:42:41,420 --> 01:42:43,180
Here's my boarding pass.

1269
01:42:43,420 --> 01:42:46,290
I'm gonna-- I'm gonna kill you.

1270
01:42:46,520 --> 01:42:49,550
Okay, fine. Come at me. Give me your best shot.

1271
01:42:49,790 --> 01:42:53,250
Go on. You don't have the guts. Admit it.

1272
01:42:55,400 --> 01:42:58,300
Okay, you have the guts. Good. Wait.

1273
01:42:58,530 --> 01:42:59,930
Death.

1274
01:43:00,170 --> 01:43:03,100
All right, I'm sorry I ate your fish, okay?

1275
01:43:03,340 --> 01:43:05,710
- I'm sorry. - Revenge!

1276
01:43:05,940 --> 01:43:08,340
Jesus, I said I'm sorry! What the--

1277
01:43:12,950 --> 01:43:15,850
Got him!

1278
01:43:25,560 --> 01:43:28,550
Got you again, you bastard!

1279
01:43:28,800 --> 01:43:33,330
Hey, I've lost my stutter. It's gone.

1280
01:43:33,570 --> 01:43:34,870
I can speak.

1281
01:43:35,100 --> 01:43:38,940
How much wood could a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood?

1282
01:44:02,430 --> 01:44:04,260
Now, listen, two things.

1283
01:44:04,500 --> 01:44:09,200
One: behave yourself from now on or I'll break your neck, okay?

1284
01:44:10,470 --> 01:44:12,570
Two:

1285
01:44:12,810 --> 01:44:16,270
Gorbachev, Glasnost--

1286
01:44:16,510 --> 01:44:18,340
Molotov.

1287
01:44:18,580 --> 01:44:22,240
- Blinis. - Lenin.

1288
01:44:24,490 --> 01:44:25,780
Pushkin.

1289
01:44:26,020 --> 01:44:28,050
- Chicken Kiev. - Good.

1290
01:44:28,290 --> 01:44:30,380
Dostoyevsky.

1291
01:44:30,630 --> 01:44:32,460
Rubles.

1292
01:44:33,960 --> 01:44:36,120
Vladivostok.

1293
01:44:40,340 --> 01:44:42,740
