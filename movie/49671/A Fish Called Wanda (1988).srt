{350}{419}I deliver perfection...|and don't brag about it! :D
{824}{885}And on that point,|members of the jury,
{891}{978}I rest my case.
{2233}{2319}Hello, Wanda.
{4018}{4049}Hi, Ken.
{4055}{4102}Hello, W-W-Wanda.
{4108}{4159}Ken,
{4165}{4186}this is Otto.
{4192}{4252}Hello, Ken.|Wanda's told me a lot about you.
{4258}{4310}Hey! Great fish!
{4316}{4409}A squeeze of lemon,|some tartare sauce... perfect!
{4415}{4454}George back yet?
{4460}{4505}No, he had to g-g-go
{4511}{4604}to the b-b-b...
{4633}{4656}What?
{4662}{4745}That's quite a stutter|you've got there, Ken.
{4751}{4813}It's all right, it doesn't bother me.
{4819}{4902}So er...|George needs a weapons man, eh?
{4908}{4929}A cup of tea, Ken?
{4935}{4977}Y-y-y...
{4983}{5019}Yeah, he'd like one.
{5025}{5086}I had a good friend in the CIA,|had a stutter.
{5092}{5167}Cost him his life, dammit.
{5208}{5277}Hi, George.
{5283}{5325}Hello, George.
{5331}{5355}Get you a Scotch?
{5361}{5397}Yeah.
{5403}{5452}George,
{5458}{5516}this is Otto.
{5522}{5553}So,
{5559}{5598}you're Wanda's brother?
{5604}{5636}Good to be here, George.
{5642}{5682}England is a fine country.
{5688}{5769}Did she tell you what we need?
{5953}{6034}Something like that?
{6058}{6144}Something like that.
{6148}{6219}Hello, Wendy.
{6243}{6288}Had a good day?
{6294}{6370}I spend the morning|"trying" to get a waste disposal man.
{6376}{6456}At lunch, Marjorie just|complained about her husband
{6462}{6530}then I have to play|"three" rubbers with Philippa.
{6536}{6603}I come back and|Sandersons have sent the wrong flowers.
{6609}{6673}Oh, no!
{6679}{6737}Would you like some tea?
{6743}{6797}Yes.
{6803}{6837}I won the case.
{6843}{6963}This is the first moment|I've had to myself all day.
{7010}{7054}Hello, Portia! How was the show?
{7060}{7112}Awful, Daddy. I must have a new horse.
{7118}{7189}- But you liked Phantom.|- He's not fit for dog meat.
{7195}{7244}Can I change him? It won't cost much.
{7250}{7309}- Oughtn't we...|- I thought you were making tea.
{7315}{7373}- I am, darling. Sorry.|- I'd better get it.
{7379}{7472}- No, no, let me do it.|- No! I'll do it!
{7513}{7544}I won the case.
{7550}{7638}Now this is cracked.
{7638}{7717}They're worth about 100,000 each.
{7723}{7764}There are 135 of them.
{7770}{7829}That makes 13 millions, my friends.
{7835}{7860}Dollars or pounds?
{7866}{7887}Pounds, pet.
{7893}{7974}This is the big one. So...
{7993}{8037}OK.
{8043}{8092}Yeah.
{8098}{8142}Otto?
{8148}{8176}Yes?
{8182}{8210}OK?
{8216}{8237}What?
{8243}{8277}The plan.
{8283}{8336}Yeah. Great. No problem.
{8342}{8436}What was the middle thing,|about the police?
{8442}{8510}We don't meet up|at Heathrow until Tuesday...
{8516}{8526}Yeah, yeah!
{8532}{8575}I haven't finished yet.
{8581}{8670}Because the police will watch|all the airports for 72 hours.
{8676}{8695}I know.
{8701}{8749}I know.
{8755}{8814}Do you want me to g-g-get
{8820}{8874}a b-b-big
{8880}{8951}c-c-car?
{8957}{8987}Getaway?
{8993}{9024}A limo, OK?
{9030}{9076}And put diplomatic plates on it.
{9082}{9137}What if he has to speak in the break-in?
{9143}{9201}Nobody says anything during a break-in.
{9207}{9277}It's OK, Otto. Ken's good.
{9283}{9329}So, next week,
{9335}{9381}we won't have to look for work.
{9387}{9457}And it won't have to look for us.
{9463}{9549}Oscar Wilde.
{9621}{9680}You really like animals, don't you, Ken?
{9686}{9725}What's the attraction?
{9731}{9768}Because you can t-t-t
{9774}{9854}trust them, and they don't sh-sh-sh...
{9860}{9884}Shit on you?
{9890}{9945}Show off all the time.
{9951}{10006}You know what Nietzsche|said about them?
{10012}{10069}He said they were God's second blunder.
{10075}{10110}Bye, sis!
{10116}{10215}Well, you tell him from me that I-I-I...
{10221}{10267}Bye, George.
{10273}{10329}If you talk to Mom, tell her I said hi.
{10335}{10381}- OK.|- Don't let him touch you.
{10387}{10475}One more day, and we're together.
{10514}{10562}I'm sorry about my brother, Ken.
{10568}{10622}I know he's insensitive.
{10628}{10666}He's had a hard life.
{10672}{10743}Dad used to beat him up.
{10808}{10843}Good.
{10849}{10910}Aaagh!
{12883}{12969}Anybody moves and you're dead.
{13683}{13727}Look where you're going!
{13733}{13769}Chauvinist pig!
{13775}{13895}Really, people here|just think they own the pavement.
{14533}{14559}That was fun.
{14565}{14603}I love robbing the English.
{14609}{14657}- They're so polite.|- The d-d-d...
{14663}{14699}- What is it, Ken?|- The dog!
{14705}{14733}We didn't hit the dog.
{14739}{14827}- $20 million and an insect worries him!|- It's not an in-in...
{14833}{14909}Stutter's not getting any better.|How about surgery?
{14915}{14976}Shut up!
{15085}{15154}Ken.
{15158}{15219}Bye!
{15943}{15968}Let's split.
{15974}{16057}- See you at Heathrow on Tuesday.|- Lie low. No celebrating.
{16063}{16112}No celebrating?
{16118}{16195}See you in a couple of hours.
{17345}{17371}To $20 million.
{17377}{17401}To a job well done.
{17407}{17428}To us.
{17434}{17499}To the best brother|and sister team since...
{17505}{17537}Romeo and Juliet?
{17543}{17624}Do you believe those Cockney klutzes|bought our story?
{17630}{17651}What morons!
{17657}{17710}- I want you to know something.|- What?
{17716}{17796}Even if you were my brother,|I'd still want to fuck you.
{17802}{17863}Oooh!
{17868}{17902}Make the call.
{17908}{17944}- Momento, carissima.|- No!
{17950}{17985}- Eventuale!|- No Italian!
{17991}{18012}Hey!
{18018}{18095}Per cominciare,|due insalate verdi con peperoni.
{18101}{18160}- E linguine primavera...|- No. No.
{18166}{18239}- Una cotoletta di vitello.|- Make the call, Otto.
{18245}{18278}Are you really Italian?
{18284}{18318}Absolutamente. Si!
{18324}{18366}My name is Otto. It means eight.
{18372}{18409}Say arrivederci a Giorgio.
{18415}{18435}Bye, George.
{18441}{18486}The police, please.
{18492}{18552}Otto!
{18558}{18602}Yes, hello.
{18608}{18679}Sorry to trouble you,|but you may like to know
{18685}{18808}that today's Hatton Garden robbery|was pulled off by Mr George Thomason.
{18814}{18899}He lives at flat three, Kipling Mansions,
{18905}{19001}Murray Road, London W9.
{19007}{19073}Wanda!
{19593}{19666}Police! Open up!
{19672}{19750}Come on, open up!
{19819}{19918}Open the door, or we'll knock it down!
{20127}{20208}George Francis Thomason?
{20463}{20494}Passport,
{20500}{20526}tickets,
{20532}{20593}money!
{20705}{20783}Asshole!
{20987}{21024}We're rich, Wanda.
{21030}{21054}Yep?
{21060}{21098}I bet these weeks with me
{21104}{21173}have been|the most exciting weeks of your life.
{21179}{21245}You said it.
{21518}{21552}OK.
{21558}{21599}OK.
{21605}{21672}Disappointed!
{21678}{21727}Sonofabitch!
{21733}{21794}What do you have to do|to make people trust you?!
{21800}{21829}Shut up.
{21835}{21896}People are always|taking advantage of me!
{21902}{21994}Shut up and think.|Where's he moved it?
{22028}{22050}What are you doing?
{22056}{22102}I'm thinking!
{22108}{22149}Thinking what I'll do to him.
{22155}{22203}I'll hang him up with piano wire...
{22209}{22297}- Where are you going?|- I'm going to talk to him.
{22303}{22337}Talk to who?
{22343}{22368}Talk to who?!
{22374}{22442}So, while installing these windows,
{22448}{22536}you knelt on some broken glass|from the pane you had dropped.
{22542}{22568}That's right, sir.
{22574}{22618}Your parents can confirm this?
{22624}{22653}Yes, and his aunt,
{22659}{22694}Georgina Thomason.
{22700}{22722}Good, Bartlett.
{22728}{22775}Yes?
{22781}{22822}Sorry to interrupt you, sir.
{22828}{22877}Thomason. A young lady to see you.
{22883}{22961}- Anything else?|- No, thanks. Do you have to dash off?
{22967}{22997}No, absolutely not.
{23003}{23024}George!
{23030}{23091}Ken's got the fish food. He'll be in later.
{23097}{23123}- Thanks.|- De nada.
{23129}{23168}What do you think, Mr Leach?
{23174}{23311}We may be OK on the glass,|but what else will they come up with?
{23532}{23573}Oh, George!
{23579}{23644}Oh, my God, I can't believe|this is happening.
{23650}{23695}That's not allowed in here, miss.
{23701}{23727}Are you OK?
{23733}{23759}It's all right.
{23765}{23809}I don't think I can handle this.
{23815}{23871}I was too afraid to sleep last night...
{23877}{23942}Leave it out, leave it out, OK?
{23948}{23988}Listen, listen, listen.
{23994}{24052}Listen.
{24058}{24127}You stayed at my place.
{24133}{24178}We slept late.
{24184}{24270}You made me breakfast.
{24338}{24379}What?
{24385}{24429}What's he doing here?
{24435}{24492}He wanted to see you.
{24498}{24548}Who did it, George? Kevin Delaney?
{24554}{24600}Do you want me to rub him out?
{24606}{24652}Anything, you name it.
{24658}{24712}I have friends making enquiries.
{24718}{24754}Good.
{24760}{24822}The jewels are very safe.
{24828}{24918}If I get sent down, it all gets handed back|to cut my sentence.
{24924}{24978}Now, to cut my sentence even more,
{24984}{25040}I could tell them who done it with me
{25046}{25149}if I wasn't very happy about everything.
{25156}{25198}What was the middle thing?
{25204}{25290}Piss off.
{25343}{25439}- You want me to spring you...|- Now!
{25528}{25587}George?
{25593}{25629}You don't think...
{25635}{25671}Do you?
{25677}{25738}No!
{25782}{25822}No.
{25828}{25857}No!
{25863}{25905}OK.
{25911}{25973}- George.|- What?
{25987}{26085}Are you sure the garage is very safe?
{26099}{26139}Trust me.
{26145}{26186}Thank you very much.
{26192}{26227}Thanks a lot. Bye.
{26233}{26283}Have a good day.
{26289}{26310}So?
{26316}{26348}He's not sure it was you.
{26354}{26375}What about you?
{26381}{26412}No, no, he believes me.
{26418}{26474}That's why he can't figure out about you.
{26480}{26502}Figure out what?
{26508}{26587}Whether you turned him in or not, stupid!
{26593}{26639}Don't er
{26645}{26709}ever, ever, "ever"
{26715}{26792}call me stupid. OK?
{26816}{26877}What?
{26930}{26987}That's George's lawyer.
{26993}{27085}The other guy must be the barrister.
{27092}{27113}So?
{27119}{27184}Trust me.
{27234}{27291}Let me know|if anything unexpected turns...
{27297}{27324}Excuse me.
{27330}{27392}Don't I recognise you?
{27398}{27446}No. No, I don't think so.
{27452}{27489}Oh.
{27495}{27562}You are a famous barrister, aren't you?
{27568}{27599}Erm...
{27605}{27651}Well, hardly.
{27657}{27751}Could I have your autograph, anyway?
{27763}{27793}Yes, yes, certainly.
{27799}{27820}Thanks.
{27826}{27891}I'm studying aspects of your legal system.
{27897}{27918}I'm American.
{27924}{27945}Oh, really?
{27951}{28014}I've only just started. It's fascinating.
{28020}{28066}What er... What brings you here?
{28072}{28118}Oh, it's a little embarrassing.
{28124}{28170}I... have a friend.
{28176}{28204}Oh!
{28210}{28231}I see.
{28237}{28260}There you are.
{28266}{28287}I knew it!
{28293}{28328}You're Archie "Leash".
{28334}{28355}Leach.
{28361}{28384}Right.
{28390}{28422}I saw you in court!
{28428}{28474}Er... two weeks ago.
{28480}{28509}The casino break-in?
{28515}{28551}You were great!
{28557}{28603}Oh, I'm a big fan of yours.
{28609}{28650}I love the way you er
{28656}{28711}cross-examine.
{28717}{28774}Oh, I really admire your work.
{28780}{28841}Thank you.
{28858}{28907}- I'd better not...|- I don't suppose...
{28913}{28959}No? Fine, right.
{28965}{28986}Well...
{28992}{29027}Thank you for this.
{29033}{29102}I'll treasure it.
{29122}{29212}Au revoir.
{29223}{29304}You speak French, too!
{29751}{29790}What's going on?
{29796}{29878}Whatever George decides to do,|he'll tell Leach first.
{29884}{29915}Why?
{29921}{29956}Because he's his lawyer.
{29962}{29986}Yeah, I know that.
{29992}{30045}So I'm going to get to know Mr Leach.
{30051}{30120}So George will tell "him"|where the diamonds are?
{30126}{30218}That's what I'm going to find out.
{30472}{30523}You done well, my son.
{30529}{30621}Now, where are we going to hide it?
{30670}{30702}Very good!
{30708}{30747}Don't tell Wanda anything.
{30753}{30804}Otto might get something out of her.
{30810}{30831}Now...
{30837}{30874}George.
{30880}{30921}You are going to g-get off?
{30927}{30973}Sure, don't worry about it, Ken.
{30979}{31000}We'll fix it.
{31006}{31040}Now, anything on Otto?
{31046}{31112}No. Not yet.
{31118}{31199}You watch him.
{31218}{31295}Ken!
{31303}{31337}OK.
{31343}{31409}Looks like the police have been all over it.
{31415}{31502}Let me change clothes,|then I'll help you look.
{31508}{31549}Hello,
{31555}{31621}K-K-Ken's p-p-pets.

{31673}{31714}Wake up!
{31720}{31789}Wake up, limey fish!
{31808}{31888}So. How are you going to get friendly|with this lawyer?
{31894}{31952}I don't know. I'll improvise.
{31958}{31989}Fucking insects!
{31995}{32084}I thought Englishmen didn't like women,|the way they talk.
{32090}{32114}No!
{32120}{32230}He's straight. He's kinda cute, too,|in a pompous sort of way.
{32236}{32277}Have you got the hots for him?
{32283}{32385}I'm not into necrophilia, thanks.
{32388}{32445}What is this? Hump-a-limey week?
{32451}{32487}Otto doesn't approve.
{32493}{32529}Otto might get jealous.
{32535}{32659}E molto pericoloso, signorina.
{32665}{32749}Molto pericoloso...
{32863}{32887}Carissima.
{32893}{32945}Oh, speak it, speak it!
{32951}{33037}Un ossobuco milanese con piselli.
{33043}{33160}Melanzane parmigiana con spinaci.
{33166}{33199}Dov'é la farmacia?
{33205}{33244}Yes, yes, yes!

{33348}{33371}Otto, not here.
{33377}{33408}Dov'é la Fontana di Trevi?
{33414}{33437}Not here, Otto!
{33443}{33472}Erm...
{33478}{33499}Mozzarella...
{33505}{33530}Er... Parmigiana...
{33536}{33644}- Gorgonzola!|- Otto, no!
{33708}{33771}Wanda!
{33883}{33969}Look what I've got, Wanda.
{33983}{34054}Treasure!
{34693}{34764}Ssh!
{35092}{35109}Aaagh!
{35115}{35150}Ooh!
{35156}{35191}Oh, my God, Ken, it's you!
{35197}{35243}I thought it was the police again.
{35249}{35295}Isn't it horrible about George?
{35301}{35379}I've such a headache.|Could you go and get me some aspirin?
{35385}{35413}Shit.
{35419}{35490}- What's that?|- My brother's using the bathroom.
{35496}{35559}- Otto?|- Mm. We just went and saw George.
{35565}{35662}It was horrible, Ken, just horrible...
{35793}{35812}Isn't it terrible about George?
{35818}{35889}When I find the bastard who squealed!
{35895}{35947}I love that man!
{35953}{36015}What are you d-d-doing here?
{36021}{36048}What am I doing here?
{36054}{36128}Wanda was upset, Ken.|She needed to talk to family.
{36134}{36165}Sh...
{36171}{36273}She's just had a sh-sh-shower.
{36278}{36358}I've got to speak to you.
{36376}{36403}Are you OK, now, sis?
{36409}{36524}- I'm fine, thanks for coming.|- Call me if you need me.
{36546}{36615}What's up with you?|Can't you think about her feelings?
{36621}{36669}Something f-f-funny is going on.
{36675}{36706}Oh dear, oh dear.
{36712}{36761}You don't know why you're excited.
{36767}{36802}- I saw the b...|- Ken, Ken, Ken!
{36808}{36891}I didn't want to say anything|while George was around.
{36897}{36940}Isn't it time you faced facts?
{36946}{37002}Come on!
{37008}{37055}You're a very attractive man.
{37061}{37086}You're smart.
{37092}{37138}You've got wonderful bones,
{37144}{37206}great eyes, and you dress interestingly.
{37212}{37226}Wh-wh-wh...
{37232}{37280}We could have a lot of fun together.
{37286}{37350}I think we'd be really good for each other.
{37356}{37417}What do you say?
{37426}{37464}You must be j-j-j...
{37470}{37495}May I kiss you, Ken?
{37501}{37532}No, you fucking can't!
{37538}{37573}Just a peck! No tongue!
{37579}{37600}No, no!
{37606}{37706}Ken! Ken!
{37750}{37777}Ken!
{37783}{37835}OK. You didn't realise I was gay.
{37841}{37887}OK, no, look.
{37893}{37914}I'm sorry.
{37920}{37962}I've handled this badly.
{37968}{38037}Look, the physical side can wait.
{38043}{38119}You need time.
{38127}{38200}Will you think about it?
{38715}{38786}Oh, my God.
{38803}{38849}Oh, my God!
{38855}{38892}Ken!
{38898}{38936}Somebody just called!
{38942}{38983}They said that the police...
{38989}{39046}No, that the loot|is in a garage in Fulham.
{39052}{39094}You and I have to go get it now.
{39100}{39153}We have to move it|before the police find it.
{39159}{39180}No, no, no...
{39186}{39229}- What?|- It's all right!
{39235}{39281}- What?|- Ge-Ge-Ge
{39287}{39322}George
{39328}{39354}M-m-m
{39360}{39404}moved...
{39410}{39454}George moved the loot?!
{39460}{39494}Yes.
{39500}{39535}Where did he move it, Ken?
{39541}{39593}Where did he move it?!
{39599}{39685}C-c-c...
{39878}{39954}I don't know where it is.|There's a key for something.
{39960}{40021}It's in...
{40041}{40062}Don't tell me.
{40068}{40147}It's better that you don't tell me.
{40153}{40278}Oh, you know, if it wasn't for George...
{40352}{40426}Otto
{40428}{40469}tried to k-k-k
{40475}{40544}kiss me.
{40553}{40629}I thought he might.
{40661}{40694}No.
{40700}{40746}Nothing, no marks at all.
{40752}{40798}But it is a safety deposit box key?
{40804}{40860}Yes, but there are millions of them,
{40866}{40907}hotels, banks, offices.
{40913}{40939}Sorry.
{40945}{40987}Thank you.
{40993}{41072}Fuck!
{41418}{41453}That's him.
{41459}{41505}That's him, Inspector.
{41511}{41611}He's the one|who tried to murder my dogs.
{42008}{42052}Davidson!
{42058}{42138}An American legal student|wants to see me for a moment.
{42144}{42201}- What time is Sir John due?|- 12.30, sir.
{42207}{42268}Right.
{42468}{42522}Come in!
{42528}{42572}- Hi.|- How very nice to see you.
{42578}{42621}Am I interrupting?
{42627}{42660}Absolutely not.
{42666}{42687}Really?
{42693}{42735}Really. Delighted to see you.
{42741}{42802}Hello.
{42843}{42877}So.
{42883}{42914}This is the place.
{42920}{42971}- This is it.|- Very nice.
{42977}{43053}I was at the courts this morning.|It's fascinating!
{43059}{43097}Really, so much to know,
{43103}{43152}Everybody wears these. Do you?
{43158}{43240}Oh, ridiculous!
{43283}{43304}Well, erm
{43310}{43359}I only have a few minutes. Sorry.
{43365}{43386}I'm sorry.
{43392}{43453}But until then,|I'm all yours, as they say.
{43459}{43525}I just have a couple of questions.
{43531}{43577}I'm having a little problem
{43583}{43677}understanding|preliminary criminal procedures.
{43683}{43741}What exactly is the committal?
{43747}{43771}Ah. Interesting.
{43777}{43851}Basically,|it's a preliminary investigation
{43857}{43920}where the prosecution|presents evidence
{43926}{43979}that the accused has a case to answer.
{43985}{44029}That's what it says in the book.
{44035}{44106}Let's take, for example,|my friend George Thomason.
{44112}{44139}Right.
{44145}{44220}- His committal is on Wednesday...|- Thomason?
{44226}{44247}Yes.
{44253}{44297}George Thomason?
{44303}{44383}Yes. Do you know him?
{44391}{44424}I'm defending him.
{44430}{44470}What are you talking about?
{44476}{44556}I'm his barrister, his lawyer.
{44562}{44627}That's so great!
{44633}{44682}That's so weird, isn't that weird?
{44688}{44766}Oh, I'm so happy you're defending him!
{44772}{44793}Thank you.
{44799}{44862}He's sure to get off now.
{44868}{44912}Wow!
{44918}{44954}I can watch you work now!
{44960}{45037}Please.
{45055}{45077}Amazing.
{45083}{45110}Well, anyway.
{45116}{45182}At the committal,|George would then plead...
{45188}{45227}Not guilty.
{45233}{45255}Really?
{45261}{45330}The evidence is largely circumstantial.
{45336}{45392}But wasn't there an identification?
{45398}{45441}True, but a very elderly lady.
{45447}{45536}I think they've got the wrong man.
{45543}{45584}You don't think he did it?
{45590}{45611}No.
{45617}{45674}Let's just say, for argument's sake,
{45680}{45721}that you did think he did it.
{45727}{45800}Sure, if more evidence|against him came to light.
{45806}{45827}Right, right.
{45833}{45910}You would then advise him|to plead guilty,
{45916}{46005}and turn over the jewels|to get his sentence cut.
{46011}{46110}And he would turn them over|to who, to you?
{46123}{46161}Theoretically, yes, yes.
{46167}{46188}Oh, of course.
{46194}{46258}Erm. Well er...
{46258}{46376}I'm so sorry, I've forgotten your name.
{46382}{46403}Wanda.
{46409}{46453}Wanda! What a fool, what a fool.
{46459}{46545}Well, Wanda, there are three...
{46635}{46664}Not Wanda Gershwitz?
{46670}{46714}Yes.
{46720}{46762}Oh, my God.
{46768}{46790}What?
{46796}{46822}You're his alibi.
{46828}{46875}I can't talk to you!
{46881}{46902}Why not?
{46908}{46964}My dear lady, you're a defence witness!
{46970}{47018}I'm sorry, I must ask you to leave.
{47024}{47060}What did I say?
{47066}{47127}It's not ethical for me|to talk to a witness.
{47133}{47178}Everybody does it in America.
{47184}{47223}Not in England, it's forbidden.
{47229}{47285}I insist, or I may have|to give up the case.
{47291}{47377}I'm sorry. Please.
{47451}{47530}Oh, Archie.
{47541}{47679}I didn't come here to talk about|boring criminal procedures.
{47693}{47774}Come on, you know!
{47774}{47866}You knew the minute I walked in here.
{47878}{47956}I want you.
{47983}{48051}What?
{48068}{48107}- Hello?|{y:i}- Sir John is here.
{48113}{48139}Show him in, please.
{48145}{48184}Make love with me.
{48190}{48227}{y:i}- Pardon?|- Nothing.
{48233}{48334}- Will you take me to bed?|- No, sorry.
{48364}{48438}Bye, Uncle.
{48506}{48589}Hi!
{48958}{49008}He's pleading not guilty
{49014}{49077}so you're safe until the trial.
{49083}{49168}Leach doesn't think he did it.
{49183}{49244}Ken says|there's a safe deposit box key,
{49250}{49319}but only George knows where it is.
{49325}{49394}Thank you, Wanda!
{49441}{49487}What have "you" found out?
{49493}{49520}Not a lot.
{49526}{49577}You realise he's in court tomorrow?
{49583}{49609}I know that!
{49615}{49647}So nothing, huh?
{49653}{49696}Nix.
{49702}{49729}Zip.
{49735}{49769}Diddly.
{49775}{49848}Bupkiss.
{49864}{49933}Niente.
{50008}{50034}Oh, it's too big!
{50040}{50095}- No, it isn't, Portia.|- It's enormous!
{50101}{50152}- No, it isn't!|- Oh, please, Mother!
{50158}{50194}No! Absolutely not!
{50200}{50259}I'm so miserable|and you just don't care!
{50265}{50322}Do shut up, Portia!
{50328}{50400}All I get, all day,|is people complaining to me.
{50406}{50490}Oh dear.
{50640}{50726}Ecco I'uomo.
{51074}{51209}Ooh, le due cupole grandi|della cattedrale di Milano.
{52258}{52341}Benito Mussolini!
{52618}{52701}Dov'é il Vaticano?
{53023}{53068}{y:i}Volare
{53074}{53112}{y:i}Oh-oh
{53118}{53170}{y:i}E cantare
{53176}{53237}{y:i}Oh-oh...
{53470}{53572}Archie, I want "you" to speak to her|about plastic surgery.
{53578}{53637}- Hmm?|- I do wish you'd listen to me.
{53643}{53684}I want you to speak to Portia.
{53690}{53742}I'll speak to her in the morning.
{53748}{53802}Goodnight, Archie.
{53808}{53857}Goodnight, Archie!
{53863}{53912}Goodnight, Wanda.
{53918}{53977}Goodnight, who?
{53983}{54069}Sorry, darling.|Just a stupid case I've got tomorrow
{54075}{54121}with some lousy old hag.
{54127}{54199}Are you George Francis Thomason
{54205}{54266}of Kipling Mansions, Murray Avenue,
{54272}{54332}London W9?
{54338}{54365}Yes, sir.
{54371}{54440}The charge is one of armed robbery.
{54446}{54496}Are we ready for a committal,|Mr Percival?
{54502}{54584}Yes, under Section 6.2, madam.
{54590}{54619}That is correct, 6.2.
{54625}{54729}Here are the statements,|all to be fully bound, please.
{54735}{54780}Stand up, Mr Thomason.
{54786}{54840}You are committed to stand trial
{54846}{54907}at the Central Criminal Court.
{54913}{54969}There is some urgency about this case.
{54975}{55016}The main witness, Mrs Coady,
{55022}{55124}is elderly and has had|serious heart difficulties recently.
{55130}{55197}Is there any possibility|that this case
{55203}{55257}might be put down for an early trial?
{55263}{55322}That is for the Old Bailey listing officer.
{55328}{55442}Take him down to the cell, please, officer.
{55873}{55910}Hi, hon. How are you doing?
{55916}{55963}You look great. I love your hair.
{55969}{55999}Got time for a coffee?
{56005}{56060}- No, I've g-g...|- Have you thought about it?
{56066}{56099}Why did he give you this?
{56105}{56153}{y:i}Eileen Coady, 69 Basil Street.
{56159}{56219}Does he want you to send her flowers?
{56225}{56247}Do her shopping?
{56253}{56280}Show her a good time?
{56286}{56369}Rub her out?
{56408}{56494}He wants you to rub her out?
{56500}{56575}He's going to kill her!
{56618}{56672}Fuck off, or I'll kill you.
{56678}{56742}Limey fruits!
{56753}{56822}So the old lady will|m-meet with an accident?
{56828}{56917}- Eh, K-K-Ken?|- Sssh. Sssh!
{56935}{56970}What's so funny?
{56976}{57054}Nothing.|Just that wasting old ladies isn't nice.
{57060}{57148}Well, it's better than b-buggering people.
{57154}{57241}I bet you £1 you don't kill her.
{57241}{57270}All right.
{57276}{57314}All right.
{57320}{57377}I love watching your ass when you walk.
{57383}{57449}Is that beautiful or what?
{57455}{57489}Don't go near him!
{57495}{57549}He's mine!
{57555}{57644}£1 says you won't kill her!
{57688}{57722}When could you look at it?
{57728}{57811}Let's think.|My wife's going to the opera on Friday.
{57817}{57884}I'll look at it then|and call you on Saturday.
{57890}{57945}- I really appreciate it. Thanks.|- Bye.
{57951}{57980}Hi.
{57986}{58032}I know we're not allowed to talk.
{58038}{58066}Give me a call.
{58072}{58127}I can't.
{58133}{58154}Please?
{58160}{58207}We're not allowed to speak.
{58213}{58272}We don't have to.
{58278}{58408}I don't want you for your conversation.
{58448}{58531}I'd love to...
{58773}{58867}- What happened?|- Got a date, Friday.
{59230}{59264}Look here!
{59270}{59333}Do you mind|not making that terrible noise?
{59339}{59385}My dogs will be having their nap.
{59391}{59435}Nice doggy.
{59441}{59506}Nice... doggy.
{59908}{59943}Otto, what are you doing?
{59949}{60007}It's a Buddhist meditation technique.
{60013}{60057}It focuses your aggression.
{60063}{60126}The monks did it|before they went into battle.
{60132}{60218}What kind of Buddhism is this?
{60297}{60352}Asshole!
{60358}{60412}It's an early Tantric meditation...
{60418}{60448}What is this?
{60454}{60546}To get information,|I might have to get friendly with him.
{60552}{60614}Well, we're ready now, at last.
{60620}{60666}Good. Enjoy the opera, darling.
{60672}{60737}- Your supper's in the fridge.|- Marvellous.
{60743}{60781}Be good.
{60787}{60871}When you say friendly,|what are we talking about here?
{60877}{60919}Cordial? Courteous?
{60925}{60953}Supportive? What?
{60959}{61052}I don't know.|Let's just see what happens.
{61058}{61132}So, friendly might include actual er
{61138}{61168}what, penetration?
{61174}{61218}I don't need your jealousy now.
{61224}{61251}- Jealousy?|- Yes.
{61257}{61369}Hey, I'm merely curious.|Me? Jealous of that fop?
{61552}{61594}What about my tits?
{61600}{61633}Does he get to handle them?
{61639}{61704}Yes. That's my forecast.|I'll stand by that.
{61710}{61735}Nuzzling?
{61741}{61793}I think $20 million is worth a nuzzle.
{61799}{61825}80% chance there.
{61831}{61892}- Sucking?|- I thought you weren't jealous.
{61898}{61980}I'm not, I don't believe in jealousy,|it's for the weak.
{61986}{62012}One thing, though.
{62018}{62112}Touch his dick, and he's dead!
{62196}{62257}I told your father|to get the car serviced.
{62263}{62295}Aren't we going, then?
{62301}{62376}Oh, do shut up, Portia.
{62643}{62714}Hurry up.
{63075}{63146}Hi.
{63152}{63234}Do you despise me?
{63308}{63387}No, that's not a word that leaps to mind.
{63393}{63479}Can I stay, then?
{63560}{63617}Of course. Look...
{63623}{63656}- Wanda...|- I know.
{63662}{63697}Your wife's coming back.
{63703}{63754}No, it's not her. She'll be hours.
{63760}{63802}It's about what I said to you.
{63808}{63851}It "is" all right for us to speak.
{63857}{63879}It is?
{63885}{63962}Provided that we don't discuss the case.
{63968}{64002}Oh.
{64008}{64032}Oh, fine.
{64038}{64092}It's just, if anyone saw us talking...
{64098}{64179}Oh, but they won't.
{64323}{64364}Sorry if I seem
{64370}{64398}pompous.
{64404}{64485}Oh, you're the best, Archie.
{64561}{64597}No.
{64603}{64627}Not yet.
{64633}{64702}I'm thirsty.
{64749}{64819}What shall I get you?
{64823}{64909}Whisky.
{64968}{65049}You are the sexiest,|most beautiful girl
{65055}{65116}I have ever seen
{65122}{65217}in my entire life.
{65238}{65314}Get me my drink.
{65815}{65899}Oh, Archie.
{65916}{65982}Mm, Archie.
{66085}{66135}So.
{66141}{66200}If George decides to change his plea,
{66206}{66284}he'd tell you|where the loot is first, wouldn't he?
{66290}{66331}Mm?
{66337}{66404}Darling, we mustn't talk|about the trial, OK?
{66410}{66492}I know. I just meant theoretically.
{66498}{66564}Kiss me there.
{66568}{66603}Oh. Theoretically.
{66609}{66680}Erm.
{66773}{66886}...to his legal representative...
{67057}{67090}What's the matter?

{67143}{67204}Ooh!
{67228}{67250}Aah!
{67256}{67289}What? What, darling?
{67295}{67340}- You're getting me hot!|- Sorry.
{67346}{67383}I need something to drink.
{67389}{67414}Something cold?
{67420}{67449}Maybe in the fridge?
{67455}{67476}Champagne?
{67482}{67547}Oh, my favourite.
{67553}{67624}Don't go away.
{67658}{67733}Je reviens!
{67949}{67982}What are you doing here?
{67988}{68036}- Relax!|- Get the fuck out of here!
{68042}{68116}- Your moaning worried me.|- I was faking it, stupid!
{68122}{68159}Don't ever call me stupid.
{68165}{68214}- And I'm not jealous.|- Then leave!
{68220}{68252}OK!
{68258}{68334}It's a nice place.
{68338}{68414}Don't touch his dick!
{68433}{68514}His wife, his wife!
{68553}{68641}For goodness sake, get off to bed.

{69453}{69484}Blocking the drive?
{69490}{69531}There you are, dear. Cheers.
{69537}{69570}Nice to see you again.
{69576}{69604}How was the opera?
{69610}{69668}- Finished early, did it?|- Whose car is it?
{69674}{69703}Mine.
{69709}{69741}It's a beauty, isn't it?
{69747}{69827}Where did I leave my drink, Archie?
{69833}{69879}Who is this?
{69885}{69908}Don't you know?
{69914}{69947}How do you do, Mrs Leach?
{69953}{70038}I'm Harvey Manfren... jensen... jen.
{70044}{70091}- I'm... with the CIA.|- The CIA?
{70097}{70131}That's correct, ma'am.
{70137}{70209}I was er...|just telling your husband
{70215}{70296}before I had to go|to your beautiful bathroom.
{70302}{70405}We've got a high-ranking KGB defector|in a safe house near here.
{70411}{70456}We're debriefing him as of now
{70462}{70492}and we're just er
{70498}{70554}checking all the houses in the area.
{70560}{70605}- For what?|- For KGB.
{70611}{70662}- Is there any danger?|- No, no, no, no.
{70668}{70731}No er... No, not now.
{70737}{70766}We er...
{70772}{70831}We just want to keep everyone informed.
{70837}{70885}So. Archie, thanks for the drink.
{70891}{70932}Sorry to have troubled you...
{70938}{70972}Keep everyone informed?
{70978}{71015}So there's no panic, ma'am.
{71021}{71050}But isn't it a secret?
{71056}{71094}You've no idea how secret.
{71100}{71170}Well, why are you telling everyone?
{71176}{71216}It's a smoke screen?
{71222}{71249}What?!
{71255}{71283}Double bluff.
{71289}{71373}You obviously know nothing|about intelligence work.
{71379}{71438}It's an XK Red 27 technique.
{71444}{71529}My father was in the Secret Service,|Mr Manfredjen St John.
{71535}{71624}I know perfectly well|you don't keep the public informed
{71630}{71692}when you are debriefing KGB defectors.
{71698}{71727}Oh, you don't, huh?
{71733}{71847}Not unless you're|congenitally insane or stupid, no.
{71853}{71902}Don't call me stupid.
{71908}{71962}Why on earth not?
{71968}{72081}Oh, you English are "so" superior,|aren't you?
{72087}{72126}Do you know where you'd be
{72132}{72192}without us,|the old US of A to protect you?
{72198}{72219}I'll tell you.
{72225}{72326}The smallest fucking province|in the Russian Empire, that's what!
{72332}{72377}So don't call me stupid, lady.
{72383}{72404}Just thank me.
{72410}{72464}Thank you for popping in|and protecting us!
{72470}{72533}If it wasn't for us,|you'd be speaking German!
{72539}{72578}Singing "Deutschland, Deutschland"
{72584}{72632}{y:i}Über alles
{72638}{72721}He's covering for me.|Get rid of your wife and get my necklace.
{72727}{72777}Necklace. I'll think of something.
{72783}{72843}- Who are you talking to?|- Myself, darling.
{72849}{72932}- Who was that shouting?|- Th-th-the brother of a f-friend.
{72938}{72977}Archie, who on earth...
{72983}{73009}I don't know. He...
{73015}{73065}- I need a drink.|- Let's go to the pub.
{73071}{73099}What?!
{73105}{73132}Let's go to the pub.
{73138}{73174}Would you like to, Portia?
{73180}{73214}We haven't been for 15 years!
{73220}{73252}Portia could see it now.
{73258}{73284}Honestly, Archie!
{73290}{73311}Aaagh!
{73317}{73356}What on earth is the matter?
{73362}{73398}I thought the picture was falling off.
{73404}{73454}Will you pull yourself together?!
{73460}{73490}What's this?
{73496}{73540}Thanks, Portia. Coming with us?
{73546}{73575}What was that?
{73581}{73613}- A kind of necklace.|- Aah!
{73619}{73641}What's going on?
{73647}{73685}Nothing. Let's go.
{73691}{73712}Can I see that?
{73718}{73777}- What?|- In your hand.
{73783}{73832}Your other hand.
{73838}{73870}Portia, go to your room.
{73876}{73903}Aren't we going out?
{73909}{73944}I can explain. I left...
{73950}{73971}Now!
{73977}{74025}- They sent a new girl...|- Oh, Archie.
{74031}{74071}No, she's Canadian...
{74077}{74169}It's lovely. Thank you.
{74218}{74269}It's even got a W for Wendy.
{74275}{74349}Oh, I'm so glad you like it.
{74355}{74467}It's the most beautiful thing|you've ever given me.
{74546}{74650}Oh, Archie. This isn't like you.
{74799}{74886}Are you fucking crazy?!
{74892}{74922}Hey, I saved your ass.
{74928}{74997}I had him right where I wanted him,|you asshole!
{75003}{75062}I give you one fucking thing to!
{75068}{75127}You had to drive me and shut up!
{75133}{75197}Oh, relax!
{75358}{75412}Hello.
{75418}{75451}Hold on.
{75457}{75522}It's for you.
{75528}{75609}Hello.
{75626}{75723}Not at the moment, no.
{75753}{75875}Yes, well, I'm not quite sure|when I can get hold of that.
{75878}{75922}Yes, yes, I do appreciate that.
{75928}{76002}Yes. As soon as possible.
{76008}{76089}Well, that would be very nice, obviously.
{76095}{76124}So. Erm...
{76130}{76164}See you soon, I hope.
{76170}{76242}Bye, Frank.
{76297}{76343}Calm down. Calm down!
{76349}{76446}Easy, g-g-girl. Easy, easy!

{78143}{78177}Hello, honey.
{78183}{78219}What happened?
{78225}{78268}N-n-nothing.
{78274}{78294}What's that?
{78300}{78324}Er...
{78330}{78354}Not Granny?
{78360}{78381}Not yet.
{78387}{78438}Oh. Who is it for, then?
{78444}{78471}A f-f-f...
{78477}{78524}A fish? Frenchman?

{78766}{78829}Wanda!
{78833}{78867}Anything?
{78873}{78902}What? No?
{78908}{78945}Why are you here?
{78951}{78997}I'm here because I'm bored!
{79003}{79126}Bored, wandering around|this awful city, shoving George's pic...
{79132}{79274}Talking to a lot of snotty, stuck-up,|intellectually inferior British faggots.
{79280}{79366}They get rigor mortis|in the prime of life in this country!
{79372}{79478}Standing there with their hair clenched
{79484}{79551}counting the seconds till the weekend,
{79557}{79627}so they can dress up like ballerinas
{79633}{79675}{y:i}at the flat at four
{79681}{79737}{y:i}2B, Saint...
{79743}{79841}To be honest, I er... hate them.
{79847}{79942}I mean, pretending|they're so fucking "lawyer"...
{79948}{80036}So fucking "superior"|with those phoney accents.
{80042}{80102}Not you, Ken.|You've got a beautiful voice
{80108}{80164}when it works.
{80170}{80234}Sonofabitch!
{80335}{80397}So er...|Want to have some lunch?
{80403}{80436}Have you heard from him?
{80442}{80479}- Who?|- Archie.
{80485}{80545}No, I have to finish my hair!
{80551}{80572}Nothing?
{80578}{80604}OK, I'm out of here!
{80610}{80645}No plans to see him?
{80651}{80677}No.
{80683}{80729}OK, bye, bro!
{80735}{80796}Bye, Wanda!
{80838}{80909}Oh, sorry.
{80939}{80996}- What?!|- It wasn't theirs to sell.
{81002}{81054}A old lady gave it to them to engrave.
{81060}{81117}Someone put it in the display cabinet...
{81123}{81176}- That's their problem.|- No. Legally...
{81182}{81203}You paid for it!
{81209}{81295}They accept their mistake|and they're offering you this.
{81301}{81337}It's much more valuable.
{81343}{81407}I adore this|and you want me to give it back...
{81413}{81465}- "I" don't want...|- They can't have it.
{81471}{81492}- Wendy.|- No. No!
{81498}{81534}- Wendy!|- NO!
{81540}{81577}Tell them they can't have it!
{81583}{81667}You're the bloody barrister!
{82463}{82537}- Hello.|- Hello.
{82548}{82617}Oh, Archie, it's beautiful.
{82623}{82713}It's just beautiful.
{82734}{82818}Oh, my God, look!
{82823}{82871}Oh, Archie, it's beautiful.
{82877}{82909}Isn't it wonderful?
{82915}{82947}Whose is it?
{82953}{83008}It belongs to someone|at the chambers.
{83014}{83057}And where are they?
{83063}{83091}Hong Kong.
{83097}{83132}Ah so.
{83138}{83184}Gone for weeks.
{83190}{83272}Nice rug, Archie.
{83278}{83349}May I?
{83375}{83414}Archie, what are you doing?
{83420}{83486}The polka, I think.
{83558}{83606}You make me feel free!
{83612}{83647}Free?
{83653}{83742}Do you have any idea|what it's like being English?
{83748}{83802}Being so correct all the time?
{83808}{83940}Being so... stifled|by this dread of doing the wrong thing?
{83946}{84000}Asking someone, 'Are you married?'
{84006}{84052}And hearing, 'My wife left me.'
{84058}{84122}Or saying,|'Do you have children?'
{84128}{84198}And hearing,|'They burned to death yesterday.'
{84204}{84314}Wanda, we're all terrified|of embarrassment.
{84320}{84405}That's why we're so... dead.
{84411}{84456}Most of my friends are dead.
{84462}{84561}We have these piles of corpses to dinner.
{84561}{84607}But you're alive, God bless you.
{84613}{84714}And I want to be.|I'm so fed up with all this.
{84723}{84794}I want to make love with you, Wanda.
{84800}{84823}I'm a good lover.
{84829}{84956}At least, I used to be|in the early 14th century.
{84956}{85042}Can we go to bed?
{85133}{85189}Yeah.
{85195}{85243}Hang on!
{85249}{85317}Mind your head.
{85323}{85362}Agh! Aagh!
{85368}{85449}Aaagh! Aaagh!
{85463}{85504}I think I love you, Wanda.
{85510}{85556}Oh, Archie.
{85562}{85606}Can I ask you a question?
{85612}{85633}Anything.
{85639}{85685}Where's my locket?
{85691}{85715}I couldn't get it.
{85721}{85746}What?
{85752}{85803}Wendy wouldn't give it back. Look...
{85809}{85844}I got you this instead.
{85850}{85891}Do you like it?
{85897}{85959}No. Archie, I have to have mine.
{85965}{86047}What's the matter? Why?
{86053}{86122}My mother gave it to me
{86128}{86234}on her death... bed.
{86240}{86282}Oh, I'm sorry.
{86288}{86319}All right, darling.
{86325}{86358}I'll get it for you.
{86364}{86385}You promise?
{86391}{86426}I'll think of something.
{86432}{86484}Sex is very, very difficult for me
{86490}{86577}with somebody|that I don't trust completely.
{86583}{86647}I promise I'll get it. OK?
{86653}{86742}Ooh! I love you, Archie.
{86748}{86890}I've loved you ever since|the first second I saw you!
{86906}{86942}What was that?
{86948}{86983}What?
{86989}{87058}Your brother didn't bring you|here this time?
{87064}{87099}No.
{87105}{87142}He's no idea?
{87148}{87199}He doesn't have a clue.
{87205}{87247}What?
{87253}{87276}He is so dumb...
{87282}{87303}Really?
{87309}{87443}He thought the Gettysburg Address|was where Lincoln lived.
{87481}{87581}Those terrible lies|he told about the CIA!
{87587}{87608}So painful!
{87614}{87687}When he heard|your daughter's name was Portia,
{87693}{87799}he said,|'Why did they name her after a car?'
{87883}{87932}I love the way you laugh!
{87938}{88022}I love you, you're funny.
{88023}{88107}How come a girl as bright as you
{88113}{88162}can have a brother who's so...
{88168}{88232}Don't call me stupid.
{88238}{88327}Jesus Christ!
{88458}{88507}Ouch! Otto!
{88513}{88562}Come on!
{88568}{88632}I'll deal with you later!
{88638}{88677}What have you done with her?
{88683}{88744}- She's all right!|- Otto!
{88750}{88791}Now, apologise.
{88797}{88846}What?
{88852}{88888}Apologise!
{88894}{88921}Shit!
{88927}{89020}Are you totally deranged?
{89103}{89154}You pompous,
{89160}{89218}stuck-up, snot-nosed,
{89224}{89275}English, giant twerp,
{89281}{89370}scumbag, fuck-face,|dickhead asshole!
{89376}{89426}How very interesting.
{89432}{89486}You're a true vulgarian, aren't you?
{89492}{89541}You're the vulgarian, you fuck!
{89547}{89591}Now, apologise!
{89597}{89686}What? "Me" to you?
{89763}{89823}Apologise.
{89829}{89862}All right, I apologise.
{89868}{89896}You're really sorry?
{89902}{89937}I'm really, really sorry.
{89943}{90001}I apologise unreservedly.
{90007}{90029}You take it back?
{90035}{90102}I do.|I offer a complete and utter retraction.
{90108}{90200}The imputation was "totally"|without basis in fact,
{90206}{90252}and was in no way fair comment.
{90258}{90308}It was motivated purely by malice.
{90314}{90358}I deeply regret any distress
{90364}{90431}my comments|may have caused you or your family.
{90437}{90477}I hereby undertake not repeat
{90483}{90605}any such slander|at any time in the future.
{90631}{90698}OK.

{92278}{92411}{y:i}Miserere Dominus
{92417}{92514}{y:i}Canis mortuus est
{92520}{92564}You said you loved him!
{92565}{92637}Right, Otto!|Here's a multiple choice question.
{92643}{92689}A. Wanda was lying.
{92695}{92741}B. Wanda was telling the truth.
{92747}{92791}Which one are you going to pick?
{92797}{92835}What was the first one?
{92841}{92885}You said you were not seeing him!
{92891}{92935}I knew you'd come and fuck it up!
{92941}{92996}I was dealing with something delicate.
{93002}{93054}I'm setting up a guy|who's important to us.
{93060}{93127}He knows where the loot is|and if you'll be arrested.
{93133}{93191}You lope in|like Rambo without a jockstrap
{93197}{93236}and dangle him from a window!
{93242}{93289}Now, was that smart?!
{93295}{93335}Was it shrewd?
{93341}{93439}Was it good tactics, or was it stupid?!
{93445}{93490}Don't call me stupid.
{93496}{93517}Oh, right!
{93523}{93591}To call you stupid|is an insult to stupid people!
{93597}{93652}I've known sheep that could outwit you.
{93658}{93706}I've worn dresses with higher IQs.
{93712}{93802}You think you're an intellectual,|don't you, ape?
{93808}{93852}Apes don't read philosophy.
{93858}{93947}Yes, they do.|They just don't understand it.
{93953}{94016}Let me correct you|on a couple of things, OK?
{94022}{94082}Aristotle was not Belgian.
{94088}{94140}The central message of Buddhism
{94146}{94212}- is not every man for himself.|- You read...
{94218}{94296}The London Underground|is not a political movement.
{94302}{94354}Those are mistakes. I looked 'em up.
{94360}{94423}Now. You have just assaulted
{94429}{94515}the one man who can keep you|out of jail and make you rich.
{94521}{94576}So what are you|going to do about it, huh?
{94582}{94637}What would an intellectual do?
{94643}{94720}What would Plato do?
{94773}{94804}Apologise.
{94810}{94852}Pardon me?
{94858}{94879}Apolo...
{94885}{94922}What?
{94928}{94949}Apologise!
{94955}{95007}Right!
{95013}{95072}I'm sorry.
{95078}{95109}No.
{95115}{95136}Not to me.
{95142}{95173}To Archie.
{95179}{95274}And make it good, or we're dead.
{95388}{95484}Oh, I'm so very,|very, very, very s...

{118800}{118840}Well, Ken.
{118846}{118900}I'm going to ask you some questions
{118906}{118937}while I eat my chips.
{118943}{118973}First.
{118979}{119016}Who was the philosopher
{119022}{119089}who developed|the concept of the superman
{119095}{119184}{y:i}in Also Spracht Zarathustra?
{119193}{119229}No?!
{119235}{119321}That's a chip up the nose, I'm afraid.
{119327}{119358}Friedrich Nietzsche.
{119364}{119397}Next.
{119403}{119456}In which book did Nietzsche claim
{119462}{119582}that almost all higher culture|is based on cruelty?
{119588}{119651}Are you thinking|or are you in mid-stutter?
{119657}{119732}You're m-mad.
{119738}{119835}{y:i}Beyond Good And Evil.
{119838}{119882}I'll have to ask you an easy one.
{119888}{119930}OK. Erm...
{119936}{119989}Let me think, let me think.
{119995}{120052}Where are the diamonds?
{120058}{120097}I'll give you a clue.
{120103}{120200}Somewhere round the airport.
{120233}{120286}No hassle, there's plenty of time.
{120292}{120414}I'll just sit here and eat my chips|till you tell me.
{120434}{120499}The English contribution to world cuisine.
{120505}{120545}The chip.
{120551}{120619}What do the English|usually eat with chips
{120625}{120717}to make them more interesting?
{120718}{120798}Wait a moment!
{120813}{120897}It's fish, isn't it?!
{120962}{121017}Here, boy.
{121023}{121120}Down the hatch.
{121158}{121183}Delicious!

{121313}{121367}What's this one's name?
{121373}{121423}Well, not Wanda, anyway.
{121429}{121468}I'm going to call her Lunch.
{121474}{121563}Hello, Lunch. Hello!
{121638}{121679}Eugh!
{121685}{121731}Avoid the green ones.

{121823}{121925}You were in court, Inspector,|when the forensic evidence was read?
{121931}{121953}Yes, sir.
{121959}{122039}And the fact that Mr Thomason|was installing windows
{122045}{122084}the previous weekend,
{122090}{122267}would explain the presence of|small particles of glass on his trousers.
{122270}{122316}No hurry, Inspector.
{122322}{122397}Please do take your time.
{122536}{122598}I'm almost full.
{122606}{122637}Almost.

{133479}{133561}So, you robbed the jeweller's,|turned one lover in,
{133567}{133632}and kept one to help you|find the diamonds.
{133638}{133699}When he does,|you commit perjury in court.
{133705}{133746}Everyone does it in America.
{133752}{133779}Not in this country!
{133785}{133833}Right! Nobody lies in England.

{134943}{135030}because I have the key|to the safety deposit box.
{135036}{135128}That's a good reason!
{135181}{135214}What do we do about Otto?
{135220}{135244}I'll handle Otto.
