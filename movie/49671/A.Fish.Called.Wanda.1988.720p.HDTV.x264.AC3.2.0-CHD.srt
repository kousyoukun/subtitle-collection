1
00:00:04,602 --> 00:00:07,481

2
00:00:24,381 --> 00:00:26,927
And on that point,
members of the jury,

3
00:00:27,177 --> 00:00:30,806
I rest my case.

4
00:01:23,177 --> 00:01:26,764
Hello, Wanda.

5
00:02:37,662 --> 00:02:38,955
Hi, Ken.

6
00:02:39,206 --> 00:02:41,166
Hello, W-W-Wanda.

7
00:02:41,418 --> 00:02:43,546
Ken,

8
00:02:43,796 --> 00:02:44,672
this is Otto.

9
00:02:44,923 --> 00:02:47,427
Hello, Ken.
Wanda's told me a lot about you.

10
00:02:47,677 --> 00:02:49,847
Hey! Great fish!

11
00:02:50,097 --> 00:02:53,977
A squeeze of lemon,
some tartare sauce... perfect!

12
00:02:54,228 --> 00:02:55,855
George back yet?

13
00:02:56,106 --> 00:02:57,983
No, he had to g-g-go

14
00:02:58,234 --> 00:03:02,114
to the b-b-b...

15
00:03:03,326 --> 00:03:04,285
What?

16
00:03:04,535 --> 00:03:07,998
That's quite a stutter
you've got there, Ken.

17
00:03:08,249 --> 00:03:10,836
It's all right, it doesn't bother me.

18
00:03:11,087 --> 00:03:14,550
So er...
George needs a weapons man, eh?

19
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,676
A cup of tea, Ken?

20
00:03:15,928 --> 00:03:17,679
Y-y-y...

21
00:03:17,931 --> 00:03:19,432
Yeah, he'd like one.

22
00:03:19,683 --> 00:03:22,229
I had a good friend in the CIA,
had a stutter.

23
00:03:22,479 --> 00:03:25,608
Cost him his life, dammit.

24
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:30,199
Hi, George.

25
00:03:30,449 --> 00:03:32,201
Hello, George.

26
00:03:32,452 --> 00:03:33,453
Get you a Scotch?

27
00:03:33,704 --> 00:03:35,206
Yeah.

28
00:03:35,456 --> 00:03:37,500
George,

29
00:03:37,752 --> 00:03:40,172
this is Otto.

30
00:03:40,422 --> 00:03:41,715
So,

31
00:03:41,967 --> 00:03:43,593
you're Wanda's brother?

32
00:03:43,844 --> 00:03:45,179
Good to be here, George.

33
00:03:45,429 --> 00:03:47,098
England is a fine country.

34
00:03:47,349 --> 00:03:50,728
Did she tell you what we need?

35
00:03:58,408 --> 00:04:01,787
Something like that?

36
00:04:02,789 --> 00:04:06,377
Something like that.

37
00:04:06,545 --> 00:04:09,507
Hello, Wendy.

38
00:04:10,509 --> 00:04:12,386
Had a good day?

39
00:04:12,637 --> 00:04:15,808
I spend the morning
"trying" to get a waste disposal man.

40
00:04:16,058 --> 00:04:19,396
At lunch, Marjorie just
complained about her husband

41
00:04:19,647 --> 00:04:22,484
then I have to play
"three" rubbers with Philippa.

42
00:04:22,735 --> 00:04:25,530
I come back and
Sandersons have sent the wrong flowers.

43
00:04:25,781 --> 00:04:28,452
Oh, no!

44
00:04:28,702 --> 00:04:31,122
Would you like some tea?

45
00:04:31,373 --> 00:04:33,627
Yes.

46
00:04:33,877 --> 00:04:35,295
I won the case.

47
00:04:35,546 --> 00:04:40,553
This is the first moment
I've had to myself all day.

48
00:04:42,514 --> 00:04:44,350
Hello, Portia! How was the show?

49
00:04:44,601 --> 00:04:46,771
Awful, Daddy. I must have a new horse.

50
00:04:47,021 --> 00:04:49,983
- But you liked Phantom.
- He's not fit for dog meat.

51
00:04:50,234 --> 00:04:52,278
Can I change him? It won't cost much.

52
00:04:52,529 --> 00:04:54,991
- Oughtn't we...
- I thought you were making tea.

53
00:04:55,241 --> 00:04:57,662
- I am, darling. Sorry.
- I'd better get it.

54
00:04:57,913 --> 00:05:01,793
- No, no, let me do it.
- No! I'll do it!

55
00:05:03,504 --> 00:05:04,797
I won the case.

56
00:05:05,048 --> 00:05:08,719
Now this is cracked.

57
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:12,016
They're worth about 100,000 each.

58
00:05:12,267 --> 00:05:13,978
There are 135 of them.

59
00:05:14,229 --> 00:05:16,691
That makes 13 millions, my friends.

60
00:05:16,941 --> 00:05:17,984
Dollars or pounds?

61
00:05:18,234 --> 00:05:19,110
Pounds, pet.

62
00:05:19,361 --> 00:05:22,740
This is the big one. So...

63
00:05:23,534 --> 00:05:25,369
OK.

64
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:27,664
Yeah.

65
00:05:27,915 --> 00:05:29,750
Otto?

66
00:05:30,002 --> 00:05:31,169
Yes?

67
00:05:31,421 --> 00:05:32,588
OK?

68
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:33,716
What?

69
00:05:33,966 --> 00:05:35,384
The plan.

70
00:05:35,635 --> 00:05:37,847
Yeah. Great. No problem.

71
00:05:38,097 --> 00:05:42,019
What was the middle thing,
about the police?

72
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:45,107
We don't meet up
at Heathrow until Tuesday...

73
00:05:45,358 --> 00:05:45,775
Yeah, yeah!

74
00:05:46,026 --> 00:05:47,819
I haven't finished yet.

75
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:51,783
Because the police will watch
all the airports for 72 hours.

76
00:05:52,035 --> 00:05:52,827
I know.

77
00:05:53,077 --> 00:05:55,079
I know.

78
00:05:55,332 --> 00:05:57,793
Do you want me to g-g-get

79
00:05:58,044 --> 00:06:00,297
a b-b-big

80
00:06:00,547 --> 00:06:03,509
c-c-car?

81
00:06:03,761 --> 00:06:05,012
Getaway?

82
00:06:05,262 --> 00:06:06,555
A limo, OK?

83
00:06:06,806 --> 00:06:08,725
And put diplomatic plates on it.

84
00:06:08,976 --> 00:06:11,271
What if he has to speak in the break-in?

85
00:06:11,521 --> 00:06:13,941
Nobody says anything during a break-in.

86
00:06:14,193 --> 00:06:17,113
It's OK, Otto. Ken's good.

87
00:06:17,364 --> 00:06:19,282
So, next week,

88
00:06:19,533 --> 00:06:21,452
we won't have to look for work.

89
00:06:21,703 --> 00:06:24,624
And it won't have to look for us.

90
00:06:24,875 --> 00:06:28,463
Oscar Wilde.

91
00:06:31,468 --> 00:06:33,930
You really like animals, don't you, Ken?

92
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:35,807
What's the attraction?

93
00:06:36,058 --> 00:06:37,601
Because you can t-t-t

94
00:06:37,852 --> 00:06:41,190
trust them, and they don't sh-sh-sh...

95
00:06:41,441 --> 00:06:42,442
Shit on you?

96
00:06:42,694 --> 00:06:44,989
Show off all the time.

97
00:06:45,239 --> 00:06:47,534
You know what Nietzsche
said about them?

98
00:06:47,784 --> 00:06:50,162
He said they were God's second blunder.

99
00:06:50,413 --> 00:06:51,872
Bye, sis!

100
00:06:52,124 --> 00:06:56,255
Well, you tell him from me that I-I-I...

101
00:06:56,505 --> 00:06:58,424
Bye, George.

102
00:06:58,675 --> 00:07:01,012
If you talk to Mom, tell her I said hi.

103
00:07:01,263 --> 00:07:03,181
- OK.
- Don't let him touch you.

104
00:07:03,433 --> 00:07:07,104
One more day, and we're together.

105
00:07:08,732 --> 00:07:10,734
I'm sorry about my brother, Ken.

106
00:07:10,985 --> 00:07:13,238
I know he's insensitive.

107
00:07:13,489 --> 00:07:15,074
He's had a hard life.

108
00:07:15,324 --> 00:07:18,287
Dad used to beat him up.

109
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,460
Good.

110
00:07:22,711 --> 00:07:25,256
Aaagh!

111
00:08:47,587 --> 00:08:51,175
Anybody moves and you're dead.

112
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:22,806
Look where you're going!

113
00:09:23,057 --> 00:09:24,558
Chauvinist pig!

114
00:09:24,809 --> 00:09:29,816
Really, people here
just think they own the pavement.

115
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,524
That was fun.

116
00:09:57,774 --> 00:09:59,359
I love robbing the English.

117
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:01,612
- They're so polite.
- The d-d-d...

118
00:10:01,864 --> 00:10:03,365
- What is it, Ken?
- The dog!

119
00:10:03,616 --> 00:10:04,784
We didn't hit the dog.

120
00:10:05,035 --> 00:10:08,707
- $20 million and an insect worries him!
- It's not an in-in...

121
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:12,129
Stutter's not getting any better.
How about surgery?

122
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:14,925
Shut up!

123
00:10:19,474 --> 00:10:22,352
Ken.

124
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:24,888
Bye!

125
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,042
Let's split.

126
00:10:54,292 --> 00:10:57,753
- See you at Heathrow on Tuesday.
- Lie low. No celebrating.

127
00:10:58,004 --> 00:11:00,047
No celebrating?

128
00:11:00,298 --> 00:11:03,509
See you in a couple of hours.

129
00:11:51,471 --> 00:11:52,555
To $20 million.

130
00:11:52,806 --> 00:11:53,806
To a job well done.

131
00:11:54,057 --> 00:11:54,932
To us.

132
00:11:55,184 --> 00:11:57,894
To the best brother
and sister team since...

133
00:11:58,145 --> 00:11:59,478
Romeo and Juliet?

134
00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:03,107
Do you believe those Cockney klutzes
bought our story?

135
00:12:03,357 --> 00:12:04,232
What morons!

136
00:12:04,483 --> 00:12:06,693
- I want you to know something.
- What?

137
00:12:06,944 --> 00:12:10,280
Even if you were my brother,
I'd still want to fuck you.

138
00:12:10,531 --> 00:12:13,074
Oooh!

139
00:12:13,284 --> 00:12:14,701
Make the call.

140
00:12:14,952 --> 00:12:16,453
- Momento, carissima.
- No!

141
00:12:16,704 --> 00:12:18,163
- Eventuale!
- No Italian!

142
00:12:18,414 --> 00:12:19,289
Hey!

143
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:22,751
Per cominciare,
due insalate verdi con peperoni.

144
00:12:23,001 --> 00:12:25,461
- E linguine primavera...
- No. No.

145
00:12:25,712 --> 00:12:28,756
- Una cotoletta di vitello.
- Make the call, Otto.

146
00:12:29,007 --> 00:12:30,382
Are you really Italian?

147
00:12:30,634 --> 00:12:32,051
Absolutamente. Si!

148
00:12:32,302 --> 00:12:34,053
My name is Otto. It means eight.

149
00:12:34,304 --> 00:12:35,846
Say arrivederci a Giorgio.

150
00:12:36,097 --> 00:12:36,931
Bye, George.

151
00:12:37,182 --> 00:12:39,058
The police, please.

152
00:12:39,308 --> 00:12:41,809
Otto!

153
00:12:42,061 --> 00:12:43,895
Yes, hello.

154
00:12:44,146 --> 00:12:47,106
Sorry to trouble you,
but you may like to know

155
00:12:47,358 --> 00:12:52,487
that today's Hatton Garden robbery
was pulled off by Mr George Thomason.

156
00:12:52,738 --> 00:12:56,282
He lives at flat three, Kipling Mansions,

157
00:12:56,533 --> 00:13:00,536
Murray Road, London W9.

158
00:13:00,787 --> 00:13:03,539
Wanda!

159
00:13:25,227 --> 00:13:28,271
Police! Open up!

160
00:13:28,522 --> 00:13:31,774
Come on, open up!

161
00:13:34,652 --> 00:13:38,780
Open the door, or we'll knock it down!

162
00:13:47,498 --> 00:13:50,876
George Francis Thomason?

163
00:14:01,511 --> 00:14:02,803
Passport,

164
00:14:03,054 --> 00:14:04,138
tickets,

165
00:14:04,389 --> 00:14:06,932
money!

166
00:14:11,604 --> 00:14:14,856
Asshole!

167
00:14:23,365 --> 00:14:24,908
We're rich, Wanda.

168
00:14:25,158 --> 00:14:26,158
Yep?

169
00:14:26,409 --> 00:14:27,993
I bet these weeks with me

170
00:14:28,244 --> 00:14:31,121
have been
the most exciting weeks of your life.

171
00:14:31,372 --> 00:14:34,124
You said it.

172
00:14:45,511 --> 00:14:46,928
OK.

173
00:14:47,179 --> 00:14:48,888
OK.

174
00:14:49,139 --> 00:14:51,933
Disappointed!

175
00:14:52,184 --> 00:14:54,227
Sonofabitch!

176
00:14:54,478 --> 00:14:57,021
What do you have to do
to make people trust you?!

177
00:14:57,272 --> 00:14:58,481
Shut up.

178
00:14:58,732 --> 00:15:01,275
People are always
taking advantage of me!

179
00:15:01,526 --> 00:15:05,362
Shut up and think.
Where's he moved it?

180
00:15:06,781 --> 00:15:07,697
What are you doing?

181
00:15:07,949 --> 00:15:09,866
I'm thinking!

182
00:15:10,117 --> 00:15:11,827
Thinking what I'll do to him.

183
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:14,079
I'll hang him up with piano wire...

184
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:17,999
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to talk to him.

185
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,667
Talk to who?

186
00:15:19,918 --> 00:15:20,960
Talk to who?!

187
00:15:21,211 --> 00:15:24,046
So, while installing these windows,

188
00:15:24,297 --> 00:15:27,967
you knelt on some broken glass
from the pane you had dropped.

189
00:15:28,218 --> 00:15:29,301
That's right, sir.

190
00:15:29,553 --> 00:15:31,387
Your parents can confirm this?

191
00:15:31,638 --> 00:15:32,847
Yes, and his aunt,

192
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:34,557
Georgina Thomason.

193
00:15:34,807 --> 00:15:35,723
Good, Bartlett.

194
00:15:35,975 --> 00:15:37,934
Yes?

195
00:15:38,185 --> 00:15:39,894
Sorry to interrupt you, sir.

196
00:15:40,146 --> 00:15:42,188
Thomason. A young lady to see you.

197
00:15:42,439 --> 00:15:45,692
- Anything else?
- No, thanks. Do you have to dash off?

198
00:15:45,943 --> 00:15:47,193
No, absolutely not.

199
00:15:47,444 --> 00:15:48,319
George!

200
00:15:48,571 --> 00:15:51,114
Ken's got the fish food. He'll be in later.

201
00:15:51,365 --> 00:15:52,448
- Thanks.
- De nada.

202
00:15:52,699 --> 00:15:54,324
What do you think, Mr Leach?

203
00:15:54,576 --> 00:16:00,289
We may be OK on the glass,
but what else will they come up with?

204
00:16:09,506 --> 00:16:11,215
Oh, George!

205
00:16:11,466 --> 00:16:14,177
Oh, my God, I can't believe
this is happening.

206
00:16:14,428 --> 00:16:16,304
That's not allowed in here, miss.

207
00:16:16,555 --> 00:16:17,638
Are you OK?

208
00:16:17,890 --> 00:16:18,973
It's all right.

209
00:16:19,224 --> 00:16:21,058
I don't think I can handle this.

210
00:16:21,310 --> 00:16:23,644
I was too afraid to sleep last night...

211
00:16:23,896 --> 00:16:26,606
Leave it out, leave it out, OK?

212
00:16:26,856 --> 00:16:28,523
Listen, listen, listen.

213
00:16:28,774 --> 00:16:31,193
Listen.

214
00:16:31,444 --> 00:16:34,321
You stayed at my place.

215
00:16:34,572 --> 00:16:36,448
We slept late.

216
00:16:36,699 --> 00:16:40,285
You made me breakfast.

217
00:16:43,122 --> 00:16:44,831
What?

218
00:16:45,081 --> 00:16:46,916
What's he doing here?

219
00:16:47,167 --> 00:16:49,543
He wanted to see you.

220
00:16:49,794 --> 00:16:51,879
Who did it, George? Kevin Delaney?

221
00:16:52,130 --> 00:16:54,048
Do you want me to rub him out?

222
00:16:54,299 --> 00:16:56,217
Anything, you name it.

223
00:16:56,468 --> 00:16:58,719
I have friends making enquiries.

224
00:16:58,970 --> 00:17:00,471
Good.

225
00:17:00,722 --> 00:17:03,307
The jewels are very safe.

226
00:17:03,557 --> 00:17:07,310
If I get sent down, it all gets handed back
to cut my sentence.

227
00:17:07,561 --> 00:17:09,813
Now, to cut my sentence even more,

228
00:17:10,064 --> 00:17:12,398
I could tell them who done it with me

229
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:16,945
if I wasn't very happy about everything.

230
00:17:17,238 --> 00:17:18,988
What was the middle thing?

231
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:22,826
Piss off.

232
00:17:25,036 --> 00:17:29,039
- You want me to spring you...
- Now!

233
00:17:32,752 --> 00:17:35,212
George?

234
00:17:35,463 --> 00:17:36,964
You don't think...

235
00:17:37,214 --> 00:17:38,714
Do you?

236
00:17:38,966 --> 00:17:41,509
No!

237
00:17:43,345 --> 00:17:45,012
No.

238
00:17:45,264 --> 00:17:46,472
No!

239
00:17:46,723 --> 00:17:48,474
OK.

240
00:17:48,725 --> 00:17:51,310
- George.
- What?

241
00:17:51,895 --> 00:17:55,982
Are you sure the garage is very safe?

242
00:17:56,566 --> 00:17:58,233
Trust me.

243
00:17:58,484 --> 00:18:00,193
Thank you very much.

244
00:18:00,444 --> 00:18:01,903
Thanks a lot. Bye.

245
00:18:02,155 --> 00:18:04,239
Have a good day.

246
00:18:04,490 --> 00:18:05,365
So?

247
00:18:05,616 --> 00:18:06,950
He's not sure it was you.

248
00:18:07,201 --> 00:18:08,076
What about you?

249
00:18:08,327 --> 00:18:09,619
No, no, he believes me.

250
00:18:09,871 --> 00:18:12,205
That's why he can't figure out about you.

251
00:18:12,455 --> 00:18:13,372
Figure out what?

252
00:18:13,623 --> 00:18:16,917
Whether you turned him in or not, stupid!

253
00:18:17,169 --> 00:18:19,086
Don't er

254
00:18:19,337 --> 00:18:22,006
ever, ever, "ever"

255
00:18:22,257 --> 00:18:25,468
call me stupid. OK?

256
00:18:26,470 --> 00:18:29,013
What?

257
00:18:31,223 --> 00:18:33,600
That's George's lawyer.

258
00:18:33,851 --> 00:18:37,687
The other guy must be the barrister.

259
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:38,855
So?

260
00:18:39,106 --> 00:18:41,816
Trust me.

261
00:18:43,903 --> 00:18:46,279
Let me know
if anything unexpected turns...

262
00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:47,655
Excuse me.

263
00:18:47,906 --> 00:18:50,491
Don't I recognise you?

264
00:18:50,742 --> 00:18:52,743
No. No, I don't think so.

265
00:18:52,994 --> 00:18:54,536
Oh.

266
00:18:54,787 --> 00:18:57,581
You are a famous barrister, aren't you?

267
00:18:57,832 --> 00:18:59,124
Erm...

268
00:18:59,375 --> 00:19:01,293
Well, hardly.

269
00:19:01,544 --> 00:19:05,464
Could I have your autograph, anyway?

270
00:19:05,964 --> 00:19:07,215
Yes, yes, certainly.

271
00:19:07,466 --> 00:19:08,341
Thanks.

272
00:19:08,592 --> 00:19:11,302
I'm studying aspects of your legal system.

273
00:19:11,553 --> 00:19:12,428
I'm American.

274
00:19:12,679 --> 00:19:13,554
Oh, really?

275
00:19:13,806 --> 00:19:16,432
I've only just started. It's fascinating.

276
00:19:16,683 --> 00:19:18,601
What er... What brings you here?

277
00:19:18,852 --> 00:19:20,770
Oh, it's a little embarrassing.

278
00:19:21,021 --> 00:19:22,939
I... have a friend.

279
00:19:23,189 --> 00:19:24,356
Oh!

280
00:19:24,607 --> 00:19:25,482
I see.

281
00:19:25,733 --> 00:19:26,691
There you are.

282
00:19:26,943 --> 00:19:27,818
I knew it!

283
00:19:28,069 --> 00:19:29,528
You're Archie "Leash".

284
00:19:29,779 --> 00:19:30,654
Leach.

285
00:19:30,905 --> 00:19:31,863
Right.

286
00:19:32,114 --> 00:19:33,448
I saw you in court!

287
00:19:33,699 --> 00:19:35,617
Er... two weeks ago.

288
00:19:35,868 --> 00:19:37,077
The casino break-in?

289
00:19:37,328 --> 00:19:38,829
You were great!

290
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:40,997
Oh, I'm a big fan of yours.

291
00:19:41,248 --> 00:19:42,957
I love the way you er

292
00:19:43,208 --> 00:19:45,501
cross-examine.

293
00:19:45,752 --> 00:19:48,129
Oh, I really admire your work.

294
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:50,923
Thank you.

295
00:19:51,633 --> 00:19:53,676
- I'd better not...
- I don't suppose...

296
00:19:53,927 --> 00:19:55,845
No? Fine, right.

297
00:19:56,096 --> 00:19:56,971
Well...

298
00:19:57,222 --> 00:19:58,681
Thank you for this.

299
00:19:58,931 --> 00:20:01,808
I'll treasure it.

300
00:20:02,643 --> 00:20:06,396
Au revoir.

301
00:20:06,856 --> 00:20:10,233
You speak French, too!

302
00:20:28,877 --> 00:20:30,502
What's going on?

303
00:20:30,753 --> 00:20:34,173
Whatever George decides to do,
he'll tell Leach first.

304
00:20:34,423 --> 00:20:35,715
Why?

305
00:20:35,966 --> 00:20:37,425
Because he's his lawyer.

306
00:20:37,676 --> 00:20:38,676
Yeah, I know that.

307
00:20:38,927 --> 00:20:41,137
So I'm going to get to know Mr Leach.

308
00:20:41,388 --> 00:20:44,265
So George will tell "him"
where the diamonds are?

309
00:20:44,516 --> 00:20:48,352
That's what I'm going to find out.

310
00:20:58,946 --> 00:21:01,072
You done well, my son.

311
00:21:01,324 --> 00:21:05,160
Now, where are we going to hide it?

312
00:21:07,205 --> 00:21:08,538
Very good!

313
00:21:08,788 --> 00:21:10,414
Don't tell Wanda anything.

314
00:21:10,665 --> 00:21:12,792
Otto might get something out of her.

315
00:21:13,043 --> 00:21:13,918
Now...

316
00:21:14,169 --> 00:21:15,711
George.

317
00:21:15,962 --> 00:21:17,671
You are going to g-get off?

318
00:21:17,923 --> 00:21:19,840
Sure, don't worry about it, Ken.

319
00:21:20,091 --> 00:21:20,966
We'll fix it.

320
00:21:21,218 --> 00:21:22,635
Now, anything on Otto?

321
00:21:22,886 --> 00:21:25,638
No. Not yet.

322
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:29,265
You watch him.

323
00:21:30,059 --> 00:21:33,269
Ken!

324
00:21:33,604 --> 00:21:35,021
OK.

325
00:21:35,272 --> 00:21:38,024
Looks like the police have been all over it.

326
00:21:38,275 --> 00:21:41,903
Let me change clothes,
then I'll help you look.

327
00:21:42,154 --> 00:21:43,863
Hello,

328
00:21:44,113 --> 00:21:46,865
K-K-Ken's p-p-pets.

329
00:21:47,116 --> 00:21:48,784
Hey!

330
00:21:49,035 --> 00:21:50,744
Wake up!

331
00:21:50,995 --> 00:21:53,872
Wake up, limey fish!

332
00:21:54,666 --> 00:21:58,001
So. How are you going to get friendly
with this lawyer?

333
00:21:58,253 --> 00:22:00,671
I don't know. I'll improvise.

334
00:22:00,921 --> 00:22:02,213
Fucking insects!

335
00:22:02,464 --> 00:22:06,175
I thought Englishmen didn't like women,
the way they talk.

336
00:22:06,426 --> 00:22:07,426
No!

337
00:22:07,678 --> 00:22:12,265
He's straight. He's kinda cute, too,
in a pompous sort of way.

338
00:22:12,516 --> 00:22:14,225
Have you got the hots for him?

339
00:22:14,476 --> 00:22:18,729
I'm not into necrophilia, thanks.

340
00:22:18,855 --> 00:22:21,231
What is this? Hump-a-limey week?

341
00:22:21,482 --> 00:22:22,983
Otto doesn't approve.

342
00:22:23,234 --> 00:22:24,734
Otto might get jealous.

343
00:22:24,986 --> 00:22:30,157
E molto pericoloso, signorina.

344
00:22:30,408 --> 00:22:33,910
Molto pericoloso...

345
00:22:38,665 --> 00:22:39,665
Carissima.

346
00:22:39,916 --> 00:22:42,084
Oh, speak it, speak it!

347
00:22:42,335 --> 00:22:45,921
Un ossobuco milanese con piselli.

348
00:22:46,173 --> 00:22:51,051
Melanzane parmigiana con spinaci.

349
00:22:51,303 --> 00:22:52,678
Dov'é la farmacia?

350
00:22:52,929 --> 00:22:54,555
Yes, yes, yes!

351
00:22:54,805 --> 00:22:55,680
No, no, no.

352
00:22:55,931 --> 00:22:57,307
- Si, si, si.
- No, no, no.

353
00:22:57,558 --> 00:22:58,641
No, not here.

354
00:22:58,893 --> 00:22:59,851
Otto, not here.

355
00:23:00,102 --> 00:23:01,394
Dov'é la Fontana di Trevi?

356
00:23:01,645 --> 00:23:02,604
Not here, Otto!

357
00:23:02,855 --> 00:23:04,063
Erm...

358
00:23:04,315 --> 00:23:05,190
Mozzarella...

359
00:23:05,441 --> 00:23:06,483
Er... Parmigiana...

360
00:23:06,734 --> 00:23:11,237
- Gorgonzola!
- Otto, no!

361
00:23:13,907 --> 00:23:16,533
Wanda!

362
00:23:21,206 --> 00:23:24,792
Look what I've got, Wanda.

363
00:23:25,376 --> 00:23:28,337
Treasure!

364
00:23:54,987 --> 00:23:57,948
Ssh!

365
00:24:11,628 --> 00:24:12,336
Aaagh!

366
00:24:12,587 --> 00:24:14,046
Ooh!

367
00:24:14,297 --> 00:24:15,756
Oh, my God, Ken, it's you!

368
00:24:16,007 --> 00:24:17,925
I thought it was the police again.

369
00:24:18,176 --> 00:24:20,094
Isn't it horrible about George?

370
00:24:20,345 --> 00:24:23,597
I've such a headache.
Could you go and get me some aspirin?

371
00:24:23,848 --> 00:24:25,014
Shit.

372
00:24:25,266 --> 00:24:28,226
- What's that?
- My brother's using the bathroom.

373
00:24:28,477 --> 00:24:31,104
- Otto?
- Mm. We just went and saw George.

374
00:24:31,355 --> 00:24:35,400
It was horrible, Ken, just horrible...

375
00:24:40,864 --> 00:24:41,655
Isn't it terrible about George?

376
00:24:41,906 --> 00:24:44,867
When I find the bastard who squealed!

377
00:24:45,118 --> 00:24:47,286
I love that man!

378
00:24:47,537 --> 00:24:50,122
What are you d-d-doing here?

379
00:24:50,373 --> 00:24:51,498
What am I doing here?

380
00:24:51,749 --> 00:24:54,835
Wanda was upset, Ken.
She needed to talk to family.

381
00:24:55,086 --> 00:24:56,378
Sh...

382
00:24:56,628 --> 00:25:00,882
She's just had a sh-sh-shower.

383
00:25:01,091 --> 00:25:04,427
I've got to speak to you.

384
00:25:05,179 --> 00:25:06,304
Are you OK, now, sis?

385
00:25:06,555 --> 00:25:11,350
- I'm fine, thanks for coming.
- Call me if you need me.

386
00:25:12,269 --> 00:25:15,146
What's up with you?
Can't you think about her feelings?

387
00:25:15,396 --> 00:25:17,397
Something f-f-funny is going on.

388
00:25:17,648 --> 00:25:18,940
Oh dear, oh dear.

389
00:25:19,192 --> 00:25:21,234
You don't know why you're excited.

390
00:25:21,486 --> 00:25:22,944
- I saw the b...
- Ken, Ken, Ken!

391
00:25:23,196 --> 00:25:26,656
I didn't want to say anything
while George was around.

392
00:25:26,908 --> 00:25:28,700
Isn't it time you faced facts?

393
00:25:28,951 --> 00:25:31,286
Come on!

394
00:25:31,536 --> 00:25:33,496
You're a very attractive man.

395
00:25:33,747 --> 00:25:34,789
You're smart.

396
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:36,957
You've got wonderful bones,

397
00:25:37,209 --> 00:25:39,794
great eyes, and you dress interestingly.

398
00:25:40,045 --> 00:25:40,628
Wh-wh-wh...

399
00:25:40,879 --> 00:25:42,880
We could have a lot of fun together.

400
00:25:43,131 --> 00:25:45,800
I think we'd be really good for each other.

401
00:25:46,051 --> 00:25:48,594
What do you say?

402
00:25:48,969 --> 00:25:50,553
You must be j-j-j...

403
00:25:50,805 --> 00:25:51,846
May I kiss you, Ken?

404
00:25:52,097 --> 00:25:53,389
No, you fucking can't!

405
00:25:53,641 --> 00:25:55,099
Just a peck! No tongue!

406
00:25:55,351 --> 00:25:56,226
No, no!

407
00:25:56,477 --> 00:26:00,647
Ken! Ken!

408
00:26:02,483 --> 00:26:03,608
Ken!

409
00:26:03,859 --> 00:26:06,027
OK. You didn't realise I was gay.

410
00:26:06,277 --> 00:26:08,195
OK, no, look.

411
00:26:08,446 --> 00:26:09,321
I'm sorry.

412
00:26:09,572 --> 00:26:11,323
I've handled this badly.

413
00:26:11,574 --> 00:26:14,451
Look, the physical side can wait.

414
00:26:14,702 --> 00:26:17,871
You need time.

415
00:26:18,206 --> 00:26:21,250
Will you think about it?

416
00:26:42,728 --> 00:26:45,689
Oh, my God.

417
00:26:46,399 --> 00:26:48,316
Oh, my God!

418
00:26:48,568 --> 00:26:50,110
Ken!

419
00:26:50,361 --> 00:26:51,945
Somebody just called!

420
00:26:52,196 --> 00:26:53,905
They said that the police...

421
00:26:54,157 --> 00:26:56,533
No, that the loot
is in a garage in Fulham.

422
00:26:56,784 --> 00:26:58,535
You and I have to go get it now.

423
00:26:58,786 --> 00:27:00,996
We have to move it
before the police find it.

424
00:27:01,246 --> 00:27:02,121
No, no, no...

425
00:27:02,372 --> 00:27:04,165
- What?
- It's all right!

426
00:27:04,416 --> 00:27:06,333
- What?
- Ge-Ge-Ge

427
00:27:06,585 --> 00:27:08,043
George

428
00:27:08,295 --> 00:27:09,378
M-m-m

429
00:27:09,629 --> 00:27:11,464
moved...

430
00:27:11,715 --> 00:27:13,549
George moved the loot?!

431
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:15,217
Yes.

432
00:27:15,469 --> 00:27:16,927
Where did he move it, Ken?

433
00:27:17,178 --> 00:27:19,345
Where did he move it?!

434
00:27:19,597 --> 00:27:23,183
C-c-c...

435
00:27:31,233 --> 00:27:34,402
I don't know where it is.
There's a key for something.

436
00:27:34,652 --> 00:27:37,196
It's in...

437
00:27:38,031 --> 00:27:38,906
Don't tell me.

438
00:27:39,157 --> 00:27:42,451
It's better that you don't tell me.

439
00:27:42,702 --> 00:27:47,915
Oh, you know, if it wasn't for George...

440
00:27:51,002 --> 00:27:54,087
Otto

441
00:27:54,171 --> 00:27:55,880
tried to k-k-k

442
00:27:56,131 --> 00:27:59,008
kiss me.

443
00:27:59,384 --> 00:28:02,553
I thought he might.

444
00:28:03,889 --> 00:28:05,264
No.

445
00:28:05,516 --> 00:28:07,433
Nothing, no marks at all.

446
00:28:07,684 --> 00:28:09,602
But it is a safety deposit box key?

447
00:28:09,852 --> 00:28:12,187
Yes, but there are millions of them,

448
00:28:12,438 --> 00:28:14,147
hotels, banks, offices.

449
00:28:14,398 --> 00:28:15,482
Sorry.

450
00:28:15,733 --> 00:28:17,484
Thank you.

451
00:28:17,735 --> 00:28:21,029
Fuck!

452
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:36,919
That's him.

453
00:28:37,170 --> 00:28:39,088
That's him, Inspector.

454
00:28:39,339 --> 00:28:43,509
He's the one
who tried to murder my dogs.

455
00:29:00,067 --> 00:29:01,901
Davidson!

456
00:29:02,152 --> 00:29:05,487
An American legal student
wants to see me for a moment.

457
00:29:05,738 --> 00:29:08,115
- What time is Sir John due?
- 12.30, sir.

458
00:29:08,366 --> 00:29:10,909
Right.

459
00:29:19,252 --> 00:29:21,503
Come in!

460
00:29:21,753 --> 00:29:23,588
- Hi.
- How very nice to see you.

461
00:29:23,839 --> 00:29:25,631
Am I interrupting?

462
00:29:25,883 --> 00:29:27,258
Absolutely not.

463
00:29:27,509 --> 00:29:28,384
Really?

464
00:29:28,635 --> 00:29:30,386
Really. Delighted to see you.

465
00:29:30,637 --> 00:29:33,181
Hello.

466
00:29:34,892 --> 00:29:36,309
So.

467
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:37,852
This is the place.

468
00:29:38,102 --> 00:29:40,228
- This is it.
- Very nice.

469
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:43,648
I was at the courts this morning.
It's fascinating!

470
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:45,484
Really, so much to know,

471
00:29:45,735 --> 00:29:47,778
Everybody wears these. Do you?

472
00:29:48,029 --> 00:29:51,448
Oh, ridiculous!

473
00:29:53,242 --> 00:29:54,117
Well, erm

474
00:29:54,368 --> 00:29:56,411
I only have a few minutes. Sorry.

475
00:29:56,661 --> 00:29:57,536
I'm sorry.

476
00:29:57,788 --> 00:30:00,331
But until then,
I'm all yours, as they say.

477
00:30:00,582 --> 00:30:03,334
I just have a couple of questions.

478
00:30:03,585 --> 00:30:05,503
I'm having a little problem

479
00:30:05,754 --> 00:30:09,673
understanding
preliminary criminal procedures.

480
00:30:09,925 --> 00:30:12,343
What exactly is the committal?

481
00:30:12,593 --> 00:30:13,593
Ah. Interesting.

482
00:30:13,844 --> 00:30:16,930
Basically,
it's a preliminary investigation

483
00:30:17,181 --> 00:30:19,808
where the prosecution
presents evidence

484
00:30:20,059 --> 00:30:22,268
that the accused has a case to answer.

485
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:24,354
That's what it says in the book.

486
00:30:24,605 --> 00:30:27,565
Let's take, for example,
my friend George Thomason.

487
00:30:27,817 --> 00:30:28,942
Right.

488
00:30:29,193 --> 00:30:32,320
- His committal is on Wednesday...
- Thomason?

489
00:30:32,570 --> 00:30:33,445
Yes.

490
00:30:33,696 --> 00:30:35,531
George Thomason?

491
00:30:35,782 --> 00:30:39,118
Yes. Do you know him?

492
00:30:39,452 --> 00:30:40,828
I'm defending him.

493
00:30:41,079 --> 00:30:42,746
What are you talking about?

494
00:30:42,997 --> 00:30:46,333
I'm his barrister, his lawyer.

495
00:30:46,584 --> 00:30:49,294
That's so great!

496
00:30:49,545 --> 00:30:51,587
That's so weird, isn't that weird?

497
00:30:51,839 --> 00:30:55,091
Oh, I'm so happy you're defending him!

498
00:30:55,342 --> 00:30:56,217
Thank you.

499
00:30:56,468 --> 00:30:59,095
He's sure to get off now.

500
00:30:59,346 --> 00:31:01,180
Wow!

501
00:31:01,432 --> 00:31:02,932
I can watch you work now!

502
00:31:03,183 --> 00:31:06,394
Please.

503
00:31:07,145 --> 00:31:08,061
Amazing.

504
00:31:08,312 --> 00:31:09,438
Well, anyway.

505
00:31:09,689 --> 00:31:12,441
At the committal,
George would then plead...

506
00:31:12,692 --> 00:31:14,317
Not guilty.

507
00:31:14,569 --> 00:31:15,485
Really?

508
00:31:15,736 --> 00:31:18,613
The evidence is largely circumstantial.

509
00:31:18,865 --> 00:31:21,199
But wasn't there an identification?

510
00:31:21,451 --> 00:31:23,243
True, but a very elderly lady.

511
00:31:23,493 --> 00:31:27,204
I think they've got the wrong man.

512
00:31:27,497 --> 00:31:29,206
You don't think he did it?

513
00:31:29,458 --> 00:31:30,332
No.

514
00:31:30,584 --> 00:31:32,960
Let's just say, for argument's sake,

515
00:31:33,211 --> 00:31:34,920
that you did think he did it.

516
00:31:35,172 --> 00:31:38,215
Sure, if more evidence
against him came to light.

517
00:31:38,467 --> 00:31:39,341
Right, right.

518
00:31:39,593 --> 00:31:42,803
You would then advise him
to plead guilty,

519
00:31:43,053 --> 00:31:46,765
and turn over the jewels
to get his sentence cut.

520
00:31:47,016 --> 00:31:51,144
And he would turn them over
to who, to you?

521
00:31:51,687 --> 00:31:53,271
Theoretically, yes, yes.

522
00:31:53,522 --> 00:31:54,397
Oh, of course.

523
00:31:54,648 --> 00:31:57,317
Erm. Well er...

524
00:31:57,318 --> 00:32:02,238
I'm so sorry, I've forgotten your name.

525
00:32:02,489 --> 00:32:03,363
Wanda.

526
00:32:03,615 --> 00:32:05,449
Wanda! What a fool, what a fool.

527
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:09,286
Well, Wanda, there are three...

528
00:32:13,041 --> 00:32:14,249
Not Wanda Gershwitz?

529
00:32:14,501 --> 00:32:16,335
Yes.

530
00:32:16,585 --> 00:32:18,336
Oh, my God.

531
00:32:18,587 --> 00:32:19,504
What?

532
00:32:19,755 --> 00:32:20,838
You're his alibi.

533
00:32:21,090 --> 00:32:23,049
I can't talk to you!

534
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:24,175
Why not?

535
00:32:24,426 --> 00:32:26,761
My dear lady, you're a defence witness!

536
00:32:27,012 --> 00:32:29,013
I'm sorry, I must ask you to leave.

537
00:32:29,264 --> 00:32:30,765
What did I say?

538
00:32:31,016 --> 00:32:33,559
It's not ethical for me
to talk to a witness.

539
00:32:33,810 --> 00:32:35,685
Everybody does it in America.

540
00:32:35,937 --> 00:32:37,562
Not in England, it's forbidden.

541
00:32:37,814 --> 00:32:40,148
I insist, or I may have
to give up the case.

542
00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:43,985
I'm sorry. Please.

543
00:32:47,073 --> 00:32:50,367
Oh, Archie.

544
00:32:50,826 --> 00:32:56,580
I didn't come here to talk about
boring criminal procedures.

545
00:32:57,165 --> 00:33:00,543
Come on, you know!

546
00:33:00,544 --> 00:33:04,380
You knew the minute I walked in here.

547
00:33:04,881 --> 00:33:08,134
I want you.

548
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:12,095
What?

549
00:33:12,805 --> 00:33:14,431
- Hello?
- Sir John is here.

550
00:33:14,682 --> 00:33:15,765
Show him in, please.

551
00:33:16,016 --> 00:33:17,642
Make love with me.

552
00:33:17,893 --> 00:33:19,436
- Pardon?
- Nothing.

553
00:33:19,687 --> 00:33:23,898
- Will you take me to bed?
- No, sorry.

554
00:33:25,151 --> 00:33:28,236
Bye, Uncle.

555
00:33:31,072 --> 00:33:34,533
Hi!

556
00:33:49,923 --> 00:33:52,008
He's pleading not guilty

557
00:33:52,259 --> 00:33:54,886
so you're safe until the trial.

558
00:33:55,137 --> 00:33:58,681
Leach doesn't think he did it.

559
00:33:59,308 --> 00:34:01,851
Ken says
there's a safe deposit box key,

560
00:34:02,101 --> 00:34:04,978
but only George knows where it is.

561
00:34:05,229 --> 00:34:08,106
Thank you, Wanda!

562
00:34:10,067 --> 00:34:11,985
What have "you" found out?

563
00:34:12,236 --> 00:34:13,361
Not a lot.

564
00:34:13,613 --> 00:34:15,739
You realise he's in court tomorrow?

565
00:34:15,990 --> 00:34:17,074
I know that!

566
00:34:17,325 --> 00:34:18,658
So nothing, huh?

567
00:34:18,909 --> 00:34:20,701
Nix.

568
00:34:20,952 --> 00:34:22,078
Zip.

569
00:34:22,329 --> 00:34:23,746
Diddly.

570
00:34:23,997 --> 00:34:27,041
Bupkiss.

571
00:34:27,709 --> 00:34:30,586
Niente.

572
00:34:33,715 --> 00:34:34,799
Oh, it's too big!

573
00:34:35,050 --> 00:34:37,343
- No, it isn't, Portia.
- It's enormous!

574
00:34:37,593 --> 00:34:39,719
- No, it isn't!
- Oh, please, Mother!

575
00:34:39,970 --> 00:34:41,471
No! Absolutely not!

576
00:34:41,722 --> 00:34:44,182
I'm so miserable
and you just don't care!

577
00:34:44,433 --> 00:34:46,810
Do shut up, Portia!

578
00:34:47,061 --> 00:34:50,063
All I get, all day,
is people complaining to me.

579
00:34:50,314 --> 00:34:53,817
Oh dear.

580
00:35:00,073 --> 00:35:03,659
Ecco I'uomo.

581
00:35:18,173 --> 00:35:23,803
Ooh, le due cupole grandi
della cattedrale di Milano.

582
00:36:07,553 --> 00:36:11,014
Benito Mussolini!

583
00:36:22,567 --> 00:36:26,028
Dov'é il Vaticano?

584
00:36:39,458 --> 00:36:41,334
Volare

585
00:36:41,585 --> 00:36:43,169
Oh-oh

586
00:36:43,420 --> 00:36:45,588
E cantare

587
00:36:45,839 --> 00:36:48,382
Oh-oh...

588
00:36:58,101 --> 00:37:02,354
Archie, I want "you" to speak to her
about plastic surgery.

589
00:37:02,605 --> 00:37:05,065
- Hmm?
- I do wish you'd listen to me.

590
00:37:05,316 --> 00:37:07,025
I want you to speak to Portia.

591
00:37:07,276 --> 00:37:09,444
I'll speak to her in the morning.

592
00:37:09,695 --> 00:37:11,947
Goodnight, Archie.

593
00:37:12,198 --> 00:37:14,241
Goodnight, Archie!

594
00:37:14,491 --> 00:37:16,534
Goodnight, Wanda.

595
00:37:16,785 --> 00:37:19,245
Goodnight, who?

596
00:37:19,496 --> 00:37:23,082
Sorry, darling.
Just a stupid case I've got tomorrow

597
00:37:23,333 --> 00:37:25,251
with some lousy old hag.

598
00:37:25,502 --> 00:37:28,504
Are you George Francis Thomason

599
00:37:28,755 --> 00:37:31,298
of Kipling Mansions, Murray Avenue,

600
00:37:31,549 --> 00:37:34,050
London W9?

601
00:37:34,301 --> 00:37:35,427
Yes, sir.

602
00:37:35,678 --> 00:37:38,555
The charge is one of armed robbery.

603
00:37:38,806 --> 00:37:40,890
Are we ready for a committal,
Mr Percival?

604
00:37:41,142 --> 00:37:44,561
Yes, under Section 6.2, madam.

605
00:37:44,812 --> 00:37:46,020
That is correct, 6.2.

606
00:37:46,272 --> 00:37:50,608
Here are the statements,
all to be fully bound, please.

607
00:37:50,859 --> 00:37:52,735
Stand up, Mr Thomason.

608
00:37:52,986 --> 00:37:55,237
You are committed to stand trial

609
00:37:55,488 --> 00:37:58,031
at the Central Criminal Court.

610
00:37:58,283 --> 00:38:00,617
There is some urgency about this case.

611
00:38:00,869 --> 00:38:02,578
The main witness, Mrs Coady,

612
00:38:02,829 --> 00:38:07,082
is elderly and has had
serious heart difficulties recently.

613
00:38:07,332 --> 00:38:10,126
Is there any possibility
that this case

614
00:38:10,377 --> 00:38:12,628
might be put down for an early trial?

615
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:15,339
That is for the Old Bailey listing officer.

616
00:38:15,591 --> 00:38:20,344
Take him down to the cell, please, officer.

617
00:38:38,321 --> 00:38:39,863
Hi, hon. How are you doing?

618
00:38:40,114 --> 00:38:42,074
You look great. I love your hair.

619
00:38:42,324 --> 00:38:43,574
Got time for a coffee?

620
00:38:43,825 --> 00:38:46,118
- No, I've g-g...
- Have you thought about it?

621
00:38:46,369 --> 00:38:47,745
Why did he give you this?

622
00:38:47,996 --> 00:38:49,997
Eileen Coady, 69 Basil Street.

623
00:38:50,248 --> 00:38:52,750
Does he want you to send her flowers?

624
00:38:53,001 --> 00:38:53,918
Do her shopping?

625
00:38:54,169 --> 00:38:55,294
Show her a good time?

626
00:38:55,545 --> 00:38:59,006
Rub her out?

627
00:39:00,633 --> 00:39:04,219
He wants you to rub her out?

628
00:39:04,470 --> 00:39:07,597
He's going to kill her!

629
00:39:09,392 --> 00:39:11,643
Fuck off, or I'll kill you.

630
00:39:11,894 --> 00:39:14,562
Limey fruits!

631
00:39:15,022 --> 00:39:17,899
So the old lady will
m-meet with an accident?

632
00:39:18,149 --> 00:39:21,860
- Eh, K-K-Ken?
- Sssh. Sssh!

633
00:39:22,612 --> 00:39:24,071
What's so funny?

634
00:39:24,322 --> 00:39:27,574
Nothing.
Just that wasting old ladies isn't nice.

635
00:39:27,826 --> 00:39:31,495
Well, it's better than b-buggering people.

636
00:39:31,746 --> 00:39:35,374
I bet you £1 you don't kill her.

637
00:39:35,374 --> 00:39:36,582
All right.

638
00:39:36,834 --> 00:39:38,418
All right.

639
00:39:38,669 --> 00:39:41,045
I love watching your ass when you walk.

640
00:39:41,296 --> 00:39:44,048
Is that beautiful or what?

641
00:39:44,299 --> 00:39:45,716
Don't go near him!

642
00:39:45,968 --> 00:39:48,219
He's mine!

643
00:39:48,470 --> 00:39:52,181
£1 says you won't kill her!

644
00:39:54,016 --> 00:39:55,434
When could you look at it?

645
00:39:55,685 --> 00:39:59,146
Let's think.
My wife's going to the opera on Friday.

646
00:39:59,397 --> 00:40:02,190
I'll look at it then
and call you on Saturday.

647
00:40:02,442 --> 00:40:04,735
- I really appreciate it. Thanks.
- Bye.

648
00:40:04,986 --> 00:40:06,194
Hi.

649
00:40:06,446 --> 00:40:08,363
I know we're not allowed to talk.

650
00:40:08,614 --> 00:40:09,781
Give me a call.

651
00:40:10,031 --> 00:40:12,324
I can't.

652
00:40:12,576 --> 00:40:13,451
Please?

653
00:40:13,702 --> 00:40:15,661
We're not allowed to speak.

654
00:40:15,912 --> 00:40:18,372
We don't have to.

655
00:40:18,623 --> 00:40:24,044
I don't want you for your conversation.

656
00:40:25,714 --> 00:40:29,175
I'd love to...

657
00:40:39,268 --> 00:40:43,188
- What happened?
- Got a date, Friday.

658
00:40:58,328 --> 00:40:59,745
Look here!

659
00:40:59,996 --> 00:41:02,623
Do you mind
not making that terrible noise?

660
00:41:02,873 --> 00:41:04,791
My dogs will be having their nap.

661
00:41:05,042 --> 00:41:06,876
Nice doggy.

662
00:41:07,127 --> 00:41:09,837
Nice... doggy.

663
00:41:26,604 --> 00:41:28,063
Otto, what are you doing?

664
00:41:28,314 --> 00:41:30,732
It's a Buddhist meditation technique.

665
00:41:30,983 --> 00:41:32,818
It focuses your aggression.

666
00:41:33,069 --> 00:41:35,695
The monks did it
before they went into battle.

667
00:41:35,947 --> 00:41:39,533
What kind of Buddhism is this?

668
00:41:42,828 --> 00:41:45,121
Asshole!

669
00:41:45,372 --> 00:41:47,623
It's an early Tantric meditation...

670
00:41:47,874 --> 00:41:49,125
What is this?

671
00:41:49,376 --> 00:41:53,212
To get information,
I might have to get friendly with him.

672
00:41:53,463 --> 00:41:56,048
Well, we're ready now, at last.

673
00:41:56,298 --> 00:41:58,216
Good. Enjoy the opera, darling.

674
00:41:58,467 --> 00:42:01,177
- Your supper's in the fridge.
- Marvellous.

675
00:42:01,429 --> 00:42:03,012
Be good.

676
00:42:03,264 --> 00:42:06,766
When you say friendly,
what are we talking about here?

677
00:42:07,017 --> 00:42:08,768
Cordial? Courteous?

678
00:42:09,019 --> 00:42:10,186
Supportive? What?

679
00:42:10,438 --> 00:42:14,315
I don't know.
Let's just see what happens.

680
00:42:14,566 --> 00:42:17,651
So, friendly might include actual er

681
00:42:17,902 --> 00:42:19,153
what, penetration?

682
00:42:19,404 --> 00:42:21,238
I don't need your jealousy now.

683
00:42:21,489 --> 00:42:22,614
- Jealousy?
- Yes.

684
00:42:22,866 --> 00:42:27,536
Hey, I'm merely curious.
Me? Jealous of that fop?

685
00:42:35,169 --> 00:42:36,919
What about my tits?

686
00:42:37,171 --> 00:42:38,546
Does he get to handle them?

687
00:42:38,797 --> 00:42:41,507
Yes. That's my forecast.
I'll stand by that.

688
00:42:41,759 --> 00:42:42,800
Nuzzling?

689
00:42:43,052 --> 00:42:45,219
I think $20 million is worth a nuzzle.

690
00:42:45,471 --> 00:42:46,554
80% chance there.

691
00:42:46,805 --> 00:42:49,348
- Sucking?
- I thought you weren't jealous.

692
00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:53,018
I'm not, I don't believe in jealousy,
it's for the weak.

693
00:42:53,269 --> 00:42:54,352
One thing, though.

694
00:42:54,604 --> 00:42:58,523
Touch his dick, and he's dead!

695
00:43:02,028 --> 00:43:04,571
I told your father
to get the car serviced.

696
00:43:04,822 --> 00:43:06,156
Aren't we going, then?

697
00:43:06,406 --> 00:43:09,533
Oh, do shut up, Portia.

698
00:43:20,670 --> 00:43:23,631
Hurry up.

699
00:43:38,687 --> 00:43:41,648
Hi.

700
00:43:41,898 --> 00:43:45,317
Do you despise me?

701
00:43:48,405 --> 00:43:51,698
No, that's not a word that leaps to mind.

702
00:43:51,950 --> 00:43:55,536
Can I stay, then?

703
00:43:58,914 --> 00:44:01,290
Of course. Look...

704
00:44:01,542 --> 00:44:02,917
- Wanda...
- I know.

705
00:44:03,168 --> 00:44:04,627
Your wife's coming back.

706
00:44:04,878 --> 00:44:07,004
No, it's not her. She'll be hours.

707
00:44:07,256 --> 00:44:09,006
It's about what I said to you.

708
00:44:09,258 --> 00:44:11,050
It "is" all right for us to speak.

709
00:44:11,301 --> 00:44:12,218
It is?

710
00:44:12,469 --> 00:44:15,680
Provided that we don't discuss the case.

711
00:44:15,930 --> 00:44:17,347
Oh.

712
00:44:17,598 --> 00:44:18,598
Oh, fine.

713
00:44:18,850 --> 00:44:21,101
It's just, if anyone saw us talking...

714
00:44:21,352 --> 00:44:24,730
Oh, but they won't.

715
00:44:30,737 --> 00:44:32,446
Sorry if I seem

716
00:44:32,697 --> 00:44:33,864
pompous.

717
00:44:34,114 --> 00:44:37,491
Oh, you're the best, Archie.

718
00:44:40,662 --> 00:44:42,163
No.

719
00:44:42,414 --> 00:44:43,414
Not yet.

720
00:44:43,665 --> 00:44:46,542
I'm thirsty.

721
00:44:48,503 --> 00:44:51,422
What shall I get you?

722
00:44:51,589 --> 00:44:55,175
Whisky.

723
00:44:57,636 --> 00:45:01,014
You are the sexiest,
most beautiful girl

724
00:45:01,265 --> 00:45:03,808
I have ever seen

725
00:45:04,060 --> 00:45:08,021
in my entire life.

726
00:45:08,897 --> 00:45:12,066
Get me my drink.

727
00:45:32,961 --> 00:45:36,464
Oh, Archie.

728
00:45:37,174 --> 00:45:39,926
Mm, Archie.

729
00:45:44,222 --> 00:45:46,306
So.

730
00:45:46,557 --> 00:45:49,017
If George decides to change his plea,

731
00:45:49,268 --> 00:45:52,521
he'd tell you
where the loot is first, wouldn't he?

732
00:45:52,772 --> 00:45:54,481
Mm?

733
00:45:54,732 --> 00:45:57,526
Darling, we mustn't talk
about the trial, OK?

734
00:45:57,777 --> 00:46:01,196
I know. I just meant theoretically.

735
00:46:01,446 --> 00:46:04,198
Kiss me there.

736
00:46:04,366 --> 00:46:05,825
Oh. Theoretically.

737
00:46:06,076 --> 00:46:09,036
Erm.

738
00:46:12,916 --> 00:46:17,628
...to his legal representative...

739
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:26,136
What's the matter?

740
00:46:26,387 --> 00:46:28,096
Oh, it's wonderful, Archie.

741
00:46:28,347 --> 00:46:30,890
Ooh!

742
00:46:31,892 --> 00:46:32,809
Aah!

743
00:46:33,060 --> 00:46:34,436
What? What, darling?

744
00:46:34,687 --> 00:46:36,563
- You're getting me hot!
- Sorry.

745
00:46:36,813 --> 00:46:38,355
I need something to drink.

746
00:46:38,606 --> 00:46:39,648
Something cold?

747
00:46:39,899 --> 00:46:41,108
Maybe in the fridge?

748
00:46:41,359 --> 00:46:42,234
Champagne?

749
00:46:42,485 --> 00:46:45,195
Oh, my favourite.

750
00:46:45,447 --> 00:46:48,407
Don't go away.

751
00:46:49,826 --> 00:46:52,953
Je reviens!

752
00:47:01,962 --> 00:47:03,337
What are you doing here?

753
00:47:03,589 --> 00:47:05,590
- Relax!
- Get the fuck out of here!

754
00:47:05,841 --> 00:47:08,926
- Your moaning worried me.
- I was faking it, stupid!

755
00:47:09,178 --> 00:47:10,720
Don't ever call me stupid.

756
00:47:10,970 --> 00:47:13,013
- And I'm not jealous.
- Then leave!

757
00:47:13,264 --> 00:47:14,598
OK!

758
00:47:14,849 --> 00:47:18,018
It's a nice place.

759
00:47:18,186 --> 00:47:21,354
Don't touch his dick!

760
00:47:22,148 --> 00:47:25,525
His wife, his wife!

761
00:47:27,153 --> 00:47:30,822
For goodness sake, get off to bed.

762
00:47:33,825 --> 00:47:37,203
God, there isn't any ice.

763
00:47:45,629 --> 00:47:47,129
Champagne!

764
00:47:47,380 --> 00:47:48,546
Aaagh!

765
00:47:48,798 --> 00:47:51,758
What's the matter?

766
00:47:51,967 --> 00:47:54,761
What are you doing?

767
00:47:55,513 --> 00:47:57,847
Champagne, dear. To welcome you home.

768
00:47:58,099 --> 00:48:01,226
Erm... let me pour you a glass.

769
00:48:01,477 --> 00:48:02,769
Whose is the car?

770
00:48:03,020 --> 00:48:04,437
The car?

771
00:48:04,688 --> 00:48:05,979
Blocking the drive?

772
00:48:06,231 --> 00:48:07,940
There you are, dear. Cheers.

773
00:48:08,191 --> 00:48:09,566
Nice to see you again.

774
00:48:09,818 --> 00:48:10,984
How was the opera?

775
00:48:11,236 --> 00:48:13,654
- Finished early, did it?
- Whose car is it?

776
00:48:13,905 --> 00:48:15,114
Mine.

777
00:48:15,365 --> 00:48:16,699
It's a beauty, isn't it?

778
00:48:16,950 --> 00:48:20,285
Where did I leave my drink, Archie?

779
00:48:20,537 --> 00:48:22,454
Who is this?

780
00:48:22,705 --> 00:48:23,663
Don't you know?

781
00:48:23,914 --> 00:48:25,289
How do you do, Mrs Leach?

782
00:48:25,541 --> 00:48:29,085
I'm Harvey Manfren... jensen... jen.

783
00:48:29,336 --> 00:48:31,295
- I'm... with the CIA.
- The CIA?

784
00:48:31,547 --> 00:48:32,964
That's correct, ma'am.

785
00:48:33,215 --> 00:48:36,217
I was er...
just telling your husband

786
00:48:36,468 --> 00:48:39,846
before I had to go
to your beautiful bathroom.

787
00:48:40,096 --> 00:48:44,391
We've got a high-ranking KGB defector
in a safe house near here.

788
00:48:44,642 --> 00:48:46,518
We're debriefing him as of now

789
00:48:46,769 --> 00:48:48,020
and we're just er

790
00:48:48,271 --> 00:48:50,605
checking all the houses in the area.

791
00:48:50,857 --> 00:48:52,733
- For what?
- For KGB.

792
00:48:52,984 --> 00:48:55,110
- Is there any danger?
- No, no, no, no.

793
00:48:55,361 --> 00:48:57,988
No er... No, not now.

794
00:48:58,238 --> 00:48:59,447
We er...

795
00:48:59,698 --> 00:49:02,158
We just want to keep everyone informed.

796
00:49:02,409 --> 00:49:04,410
So. Archie, thanks for the drink.

797
00:49:04,661 --> 00:49:06,370
Sorry to have troubled you...

798
00:49:06,621 --> 00:49:08,039
Keep everyone informed?

799
00:49:08,290 --> 00:49:09,832
So there's no panic, ma'am.

800
00:49:10,083 --> 00:49:11,292
But isn't it a secret?

801
00:49:11,543 --> 00:49:13,127
You've no idea how secret.

802
00:49:13,378 --> 00:49:16,297
Well, why are you telling everyone?

803
00:49:16,547 --> 00:49:18,214
It's a smoke screen?

804
00:49:18,466 --> 00:49:19,591
What?!

805
00:49:19,842 --> 00:49:21,009
Double bluff.

806
00:49:21,260 --> 00:49:24,763
You obviously know nothing
about intelligence work.

807
00:49:25,014 --> 00:49:27,474
It's an XK Red 27 technique.

808
00:49:27,725 --> 00:49:31,269
My father was in the Secret Service,
Mr Manfredjen St John.

809
00:49:31,519 --> 00:49:35,230
I know perfectly well
you don't keep the public informed

810
00:49:35,482 --> 00:49:38,067
when you are debriefing KGB defectors.

811
00:49:38,318 --> 00:49:39,526
Oh, you don't, huh?

812
00:49:39,778 --> 00:49:44,531
Not unless you're
congenitally insane or stupid, no.

813
00:49:44,783 --> 00:49:46,825
Don't call me stupid.

814
00:49:47,077 --> 00:49:49,328
Why on earth not?

815
00:49:49,578 --> 00:49:54,290
Oh, you English are "so" superior,
aren't you?

816
00:49:54,541 --> 00:49:56,167
Do you know where you'd be

817
00:49:56,418 --> 00:49:58,920
without us,
the old US of A to protect you?

818
00:49:59,171 --> 00:50:00,046
I'll tell you.

819
00:50:00,297 --> 00:50:04,509
The smallest fucking province
in the Russian Empire, that's what!

820
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:06,636
So don't call me stupid, lady.

821
00:50:06,886 --> 00:50:07,761
Just thank me.

822
00:50:08,012 --> 00:50:10,263
Thank you for popping in
and protecting us!

823
00:50:10,515 --> 00:50:13,141
If it wasn't for us,
you'd be speaking German!

824
00:50:13,393 --> 00:50:15,018
Singing "Deutschland, Deutschland"

825
00:50:15,269 --> 00:50:17,270
Über alles

826
00:50:17,522 --> 00:50:20,982
He's covering for me.
Get rid of your wife and get my necklace.

827
00:50:21,234 --> 00:50:23,318
Necklace. I'll think of something.

828
00:50:23,569 --> 00:50:26,071
- Who are you talking to?
- Myself, darling.

829
00:50:26,321 --> 00:50:29,782
- Who was that shouting?
- Th-th-the brother of a f-friend.

830
00:50:30,033 --> 00:50:31,659
Archie, who on earth...

831
00:50:31,910 --> 00:50:32,993
I don't know. He...

832
00:50:33,245 --> 00:50:35,329
- I need a drink.
- Let's go to the pub.

833
00:50:35,580 --> 00:50:36,747
What?!

834
00:50:36,998 --> 00:50:38,124
Let's go to the pub.

835
00:50:38,375 --> 00:50:39,875
Would you like to, Portia?

836
00:50:40,127 --> 00:50:41,544
We haven't been for 15 years!

837
00:50:41,794 --> 00:50:43,128
Portia could see it now.

838
00:50:43,379 --> 00:50:44,462
Honestly, Archie!

839
00:50:44,714 --> 00:50:45,588
Aaagh!

840
00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:47,465
What on earth is the matter?

841
00:50:47,717 --> 00:50:49,217
I thought the picture was falling off.

842
00:50:49,468 --> 00:50:51,553
Will you pull yourself together?!

843
00:50:51,804 --> 00:50:53,054
What's this?

844
00:50:53,305 --> 00:50:55,140
Thanks, Portia. Coming with us?

845
00:50:55,391 --> 00:50:56,599
What was that?

846
00:50:56,851 --> 00:50:58,184
- A kind of necklace.
- Aah!

847
00:50:58,436 --> 00:50:59,352
What's going on?

848
00:50:59,602 --> 00:51:01,186
Nothing. Let's go.

849
00:51:01,438 --> 00:51:02,312
Can I see that?

850
00:51:02,564 --> 00:51:05,024
- What?
- In your hand.

851
00:51:05,275 --> 00:51:07,317
Your other hand.

852
00:51:07,569 --> 00:51:08,902
Portia, go to your room.

853
00:51:09,154 --> 00:51:10,279
Aren't we going out?

854
00:51:10,530 --> 00:51:11,989
I can explain. I left...

855
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:13,115
Now!

856
00:51:13,366 --> 00:51:15,367
- They sent a new girl...
- Oh, Archie.

857
00:51:15,618 --> 00:51:17,286
No, she's Canadian...

858
00:51:17,536 --> 00:51:21,372
It's lovely. Thank you.

859
00:51:23,417 --> 00:51:25,543
It's even got a W for Wendy.

860
00:51:25,794 --> 00:51:28,880
Oh, I'm so glad you like it.

861
00:51:29,131 --> 00:51:33,801
It's the most beautiful thing
you've ever given me.

862
00:51:37,096 --> 00:51:41,433
Oh, Archie. This isn't like you.

863
00:51:47,648 --> 00:51:51,276
Are you fucking crazy?!

864
00:51:51,527 --> 00:51:52,778
Hey, I saved your ass.

865
00:51:53,028 --> 00:51:55,905
I had him right where I wanted him,
you asshole!

866
00:51:56,156 --> 00:51:58,616
I give you one fucking thing to!

867
00:51:58,867 --> 00:52:01,327
You had to drive me and shut up!

868
00:52:01,578 --> 00:52:04,246
Oh, relax!

869
00:52:10,961 --> 00:52:13,213
Hello.

870
00:52:13,464 --> 00:52:14,839
Hold on.

871
00:52:15,091 --> 00:52:17,801
It's for you.

872
00:52:18,052 --> 00:52:21,429
Hello.

873
00:52:22,139 --> 00:52:26,184
Not at the moment, no.

874
00:52:27,435 --> 00:52:32,523
Yes, well, I'm not quite sure
when I can get hold of that.

875
00:52:32,649 --> 00:52:34,483
Yes, yes, I do appreciate that.

876
00:52:34,734 --> 00:52:37,820
Yes. As soon as possible.

877
00:52:38,071 --> 00:52:41,448
Well, that would be very nice, obviously.

878
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:42,908
So. Erm...

879
00:52:43,159 --> 00:52:44,576
See you soon, I hope.

880
00:52:44,827 --> 00:52:47,829
Bye, Frank.

881
00:52:50,124 --> 00:52:52,041
Calm down. Calm down!

882
00:52:52,292 --> 00:52:56,337
Easy, g-g-girl. Easy, easy!

883
00:53:02,052 --> 00:53:03,302
Come here!

884
00:53:04,006 --> 00:53:05,797
Smell. Smell!

885
00:53:06,048 --> 00:53:07,798
Smell, Maggie, smell.

886
00:53:08,049 --> 00:53:09,632
Now. Now!

887
00:53:09,885 --> 00:53:12,385
Kill, kill!

888
00:53:12,636 --> 00:53:13,844
Kill!

889
00:53:14,095 --> 00:53:16,220
Kill!

890
00:53:16,473 --> 00:53:19,390
Kill!

891
00:53:41,488 --> 00:53:44,572
We therefore
commit its body to the ground.

892
00:53:44,823 --> 00:53:45,906
Earth to earth.

893
00:53:46,158 --> 00:53:48,033
Ashes to ashes.

894
00:53:48,284 --> 00:53:51,785
Dust to dust.

895
00:53:52,537 --> 00:53:55,622
Miserere Dominus

896
00:53:55,872 --> 00:54:01,750
Miserere Dominus

897
00:54:02,001 --> 00:54:07,253
Canis mortuus est

898
00:54:07,546 --> 00:54:08,962
Hello, honey.

899
00:54:09,215 --> 00:54:10,714
What happened?

900
00:54:10,965 --> 00:54:12,757
N-n-nothing.

901
00:54:13,007 --> 00:54:13,839
What's that?

902
00:54:14,091 --> 00:54:15,090
Er...

903
00:54:15,343 --> 00:54:16,342
Not Granny?

904
00:54:16,593 --> 00:54:17,467
Not yet.

905
00:54:17,719 --> 00:54:19,844
Oh. Who is it for, then?

906
00:54:20,096 --> 00:54:21,220
A f-f-f...

907
00:54:21,472 --> 00:54:23,430
A fish? Frenchman?

908
00:54:23,681 --> 00:54:25,389
- A phone operator?
- Friend.

909
00:54:25,642 --> 00:54:27,642
Oh, a four-legged one?

910
00:54:27,893 --> 00:54:28,975
Where's my sister?

911
00:54:29,228 --> 00:54:30,393
She's in the b-b-b...

912
00:54:30,644 --> 00:54:32,102
Thank you.

913
00:54:32,354 --> 00:54:33,269
Lavatory.

914
00:54:33,521 --> 00:54:36,146
Wanda!

915
00:54:36,314 --> 00:54:37,730
Anything?

916
00:54:37,982 --> 00:54:39,190
What? No?

917
00:54:39,441 --> 00:54:40,982
Why are you here?

918
00:54:41,235 --> 00:54:43,151
I'm here because I'm bored!

919
00:54:43,402 --> 00:54:48,530
Bored, wandering around
this awful city, shoving George's pic...

920
00:54:48,781 --> 00:54:54,700
Talking to a lot of snotty, stuck-up,
intellectually inferior British faggots.

921
00:54:54,952 --> 00:54:58,536
They get rigor mortis
in the prime of life in this country!

922
00:54:58,788 --> 00:55:03,206
Standing there with their hair clenched

923
00:55:03,457 --> 00:55:06,250
counting the seconds till the weekend,

924
00:55:06,500 --> 00:55:09,418
so they can dress up like ballerinas

925
00:55:09,669 --> 00:55:11,419
at the flat at four

926
00:55:11,671 --> 00:55:14,004
2B, Saint...

927
00:55:14,256 --> 00:55:18,340
To be honest, I er... hate them.

928
00:55:18,592 --> 00:55:22,552
I mean, pretending
they're so fucking "lawyer"...

929
00:55:22,803 --> 00:55:26,470
So fucking "superior"
with those phoney accents.

930
00:55:26,721 --> 00:55:29,222
Not you, Ken.
You've got a beautiful voice

931
00:55:29,473 --> 00:55:31,807
when it works.

932
00:55:32,058 --> 00:55:34,725
Sonofabitch!

933
00:55:38,938 --> 00:55:41,522
So er...
Want to have some lunch?

934
00:55:41,772 --> 00:55:43,147
Have you heard from him?

935
00:55:43,399 --> 00:55:44,940
- Who?
- Archie.

936
00:55:45,191 --> 00:55:47,692
No, I have to finish my hair!

937
00:55:47,944 --> 00:55:48,818
Nothing?

938
00:55:49,069 --> 00:55:50,152
OK, I'm out of here!

939
00:55:50,404 --> 00:55:51,862
No plans to see him?

940
00:55:52,113 --> 00:55:53,195
No.

941
00:55:53,448 --> 00:55:55,364
OK, bye, bro!

942
00:55:55,615 --> 00:55:58,158
Bye, Wanda!

943
00:55:59,909 --> 00:56:02,869
Oh, sorry.

944
00:56:04,121 --> 00:56:06,496
- What?!
- It wasn't theirs to sell.

945
00:56:06,748 --> 00:56:08,914
A old lady gave it to them to engrave.

946
00:56:09,166 --> 00:56:11,541
Someone put it in the display cabinet...

947
00:56:11,792 --> 00:56:14,001
- That's their problem.
- No. Legally...

948
00:56:14,253 --> 00:56:15,127
You paid for it!

949
00:56:15,378 --> 00:56:18,962
They accept their mistake
and they're offering you this.

950
00:56:19,213 --> 00:56:20,713
It's much more valuable.

951
00:56:20,965 --> 00:56:23,632
I adore this
and you want me to give it back...

952
00:56:23,884 --> 00:56:26,051
- "I" don't want...
- They can't have it.

953
00:56:26,302 --> 00:56:27,176
- Wendy.
- No. No!

954
00:56:27,428 --> 00:56:28,927
- Wendy!
- NO!

955
00:56:29,179 --> 00:56:30,720
Tell them they can't have it!

956
00:56:30,971 --> 00:56:34,472
You're the bloody barrister!

957
00:57:07,661 --> 00:57:10,746
- Hello.
- Hello.

958
00:57:11,205 --> 00:57:14,081
Oh, Archie, it's beautiful.

959
00:57:14,332 --> 00:57:18,083
It's just beautiful.

960
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:22,461
Oh, my God, look!

961
00:57:22,671 --> 00:57:24,671
Oh, Archie, it's beautiful.

962
00:57:24,923 --> 00:57:26,255
Isn't it wonderful?

963
00:57:26,507 --> 00:57:27,839
Whose is it?

964
00:57:28,091 --> 00:57:30,383
It belongs to someone
at the chambers.

965
00:57:30,634 --> 00:57:32,425
And where are they?

966
00:57:32,677 --> 00:57:33,843
Hong Kong.

967
00:57:34,095 --> 00:57:35,552
Ah so.

968
00:57:35,805 --> 00:57:37,721
Gone for weeks.

969
00:57:37,972 --> 00:57:41,390
Nice rug, Archie.

970
00:57:41,642 --> 00:57:44,601
May I?

971
00:57:45,686 --> 00:57:47,310
Archie, what are you doing?

972
00:57:47,561 --> 00:57:50,312
The polka, I think.

973
00:57:53,315 --> 00:57:55,315
You make me feel free!

974
00:57:55,567 --> 00:57:57,025
Free?

975
00:57:57,276 --> 00:58:00,985
Do you have any idea
what it's like being English?

976
00:58:01,237 --> 00:58:03,487
Being so correct all the time?

977
00:58:03,738 --> 00:58:09,241
Being so... stifled
by this dread of doing the wrong thing?

978
00:58:09,492 --> 00:58:11,742
Asking someone, 'Are you married?'

979
00:58:11,994 --> 00:58:13,911
And hearing, 'My wife left me.'

980
00:58:14,162 --> 00:58:16,830
Or saying,
'Do you have children?'

981
00:58:17,081 --> 00:58:19,998
And hearing,
'They burned to death yesterday.'

982
00:58:20,249 --> 00:58:24,834
Wanda, we're all terrified
of embarrassment.

983
00:58:25,086 --> 00:58:28,628
That's why we're so... dead.

984
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:30,755
Most of my friends are dead.

985
00:58:31,007 --> 00:58:35,133
We have these piles of corpses to dinner.

986
00:58:35,135 --> 00:58:37,051
But you're alive, God bless you.

987
00:58:37,301 --> 00:58:41,511
And I want to be.
I'm so fed up with all this.

988
00:58:41,888 --> 00:58:44,848
I want to make love with you, Wanda.

989
00:58:45,099 --> 00:58:46,056
I'm a good lover.

990
00:58:46,307 --> 00:58:51,601
At least, I used to be
in the early 14th century.

991
00:58:51,603 --> 00:58:55,187
Can we go to bed?

992
00:58:58,982 --> 00:59:01,315
Yeah.

993
00:59:01,568 --> 00:59:03,568
Hang on!

994
00:59:03,819 --> 00:59:06,653
Mind your head.

995
00:59:06,904 --> 00:59:08,529
Agh! Aagh!

996
00:59:08,780 --> 00:59:12,156
Aaagh! Aaagh!

997
00:59:12,741 --> 00:59:14,449
I think I love you, Wanda.

998
00:59:14,701 --> 00:59:16,617
Oh, Archie.

999
00:59:16,869 --> 00:59:18,702
Can I ask you a question?

1000
00:59:18,953 --> 00:59:19,827
Anything.

1001
00:59:20,079 --> 00:59:21,996
Where's my locket?

1002
00:59:22,247 --> 00:59:23,246
I couldn't get it.

1003
00:59:23,498 --> 00:59:24,539
What?

1004
00:59:24,791 --> 00:59:26,916
Wendy wouldn't give it back. Look...

1005
00:59:27,168 --> 00:59:28,625
I got you this instead.

1006
00:59:28,876 --> 00:59:30,584
Do you like it?

1007
00:59:30,836 --> 00:59:33,420
No. Archie, I have to have mine.

1008
00:59:33,671 --> 00:59:37,088
What's the matter? Why?

1009
00:59:37,341 --> 00:59:40,216
My mother gave it to me

1010
00:59:40,468 --> 00:59:44,886
on her death... bed.

1011
00:59:45,137 --> 00:59:46,887
Oh, I'm sorry.

1012
00:59:47,138 --> 00:59:48,429
All right, darling.

1013
00:59:48,680 --> 00:59:50,055
I'll get it for you.

1014
00:59:50,307 --> 00:59:51,181
You promise?

1015
00:59:51,432 --> 00:59:52,890
I'll think of something.

1016
00:59:53,142 --> 00:59:55,309
Sex is very, very difficult for me

1017
00:59:55,560 --> 00:59:59,186
with somebody
that I don't trust completely.

1018
00:59:59,438 --> 01:00:02,105
I promise I'll get it. OK?

1019
01:00:02,357 --> 01:00:06,066
Ooh! I love you, Archie.

1020
01:00:06,317 --> 01:00:12,236
I've loved you ever since
the first second I saw you!

1021
01:00:12,905 --> 01:00:14,404
What was that?

1022
01:00:14,656 --> 01:00:16,113
What?

1023
01:00:16,366 --> 01:00:19,241
Your brother didn't bring you
here this time?

1024
01:00:19,493 --> 01:00:20,950
No.

1025
01:00:21,202 --> 01:00:22,743
He's no idea?

1026
01:00:22,994 --> 01:00:25,119
He doesn't have a clue.

1027
01:00:25,371 --> 01:00:27,120
What?

1028
01:00:27,372 --> 01:00:28,329
He is so dumb...

1029
01:00:28,581 --> 01:00:29,455
Really?

1030
01:00:29,707 --> 01:00:35,293
He thought the Gettysburg Address
was where Lincoln lived.

1031
01:00:36,879 --> 01:00:41,047
Those terrible lies
he told about the CIA!

1032
01:00:41,297 --> 01:00:42,171
So painful!

1033
01:00:42,423 --> 01:00:45,466
When he heard
your daughter's name was Portia,

1034
01:00:45,717 --> 01:00:50,135
he said,
'Why did they name her after a car?'

1035
01:00:53,639 --> 01:00:55,681
I love the way you laugh!

1036
01:00:55,933 --> 01:00:59,433
I love you, you're funny.

1037
01:00:59,476 --> 01:01:02,977
How come a girl as bright as you

1038
01:01:03,229 --> 01:01:05,270
can have a brother who's so...

1039
01:01:05,522 --> 01:01:08,189
Don't call me stupid.

1040
01:01:08,440 --> 01:01:12,149
Jesus Christ!

1041
01:01:17,612 --> 01:01:19,654
Ouch! Otto!

1042
01:01:19,905 --> 01:01:21,947
Come on!

1043
01:01:22,199 --> 01:01:24,866
I'll deal with you later!

1044
01:01:25,118 --> 01:01:26,742
What have you done with her?

1045
01:01:26,994 --> 01:01:29,536
- She's all right!
- Otto!

1046
01:01:29,787 --> 01:01:31,495
Now, apologise.

1047
01:01:31,746 --> 01:01:33,788
What?

1048
01:01:34,039 --> 01:01:35,539
Apologise!

1049
01:01:35,791 --> 01:01:36,915
Shit!

1050
01:01:37,166 --> 01:01:41,042
Are you totally deranged?

1051
01:01:44,505 --> 01:01:46,630
You pompous,

1052
01:01:46,881 --> 01:01:49,299
stuck-up, snot-nosed,

1053
01:01:49,549 --> 01:01:51,674
English, giant twerp,

1054
01:01:51,926 --> 01:01:55,635
scumbag, fuck-face,
dickhead asshole!

1055
01:01:55,886 --> 01:01:57,970
How very interesting.

1056
01:01:58,222 --> 01:02:00,472
You're a true vulgarian, aren't you?

1057
01:02:00,724 --> 01:02:02,765
You're the vulgarian, you fuck!

1058
01:02:03,017 --> 01:02:04,850
Now, apologise!

1059
01:02:05,102 --> 01:02:08,811
What? "Me" to you?

1060
01:02:12,023 --> 01:02:14,523
Apologise.

1061
01:02:14,774 --> 01:02:16,149
All right, I apologise.

1062
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:17,566
You're really sorry?

1063
01:02:17,818 --> 01:02:19,276
I'm really, really sorry.

1064
01:02:19,527 --> 01:02:21,944
I apologise unreservedly.

1065
01:02:22,195 --> 01:02:23,111
You take it back?

1066
01:02:23,363 --> 01:02:26,156
I do.
I offer a complete and utter retraction.

1067
01:02:26,406 --> 01:02:30,240
The imputation was "totally"
without basis in fact,

1068
01:02:30,492 --> 01:02:32,409
and was in no way fair comment.

1069
01:02:32,660 --> 01:02:34,744
It was motivated purely by malice.

1070
01:02:34,996 --> 01:02:36,829
I deeply regret any distress

1071
01:02:37,080 --> 01:02:39,873
my comments
may have caused you or your family.

1072
01:02:40,124 --> 01:02:41,790
I hereby undertake not repeat

1073
01:02:42,041 --> 01:02:47,126
any such slander
at any time in the future.

1074
01:02:48,212 --> 01:02:51,005
OK.

1075
01:03:52,336 --> 01:03:56,629
Miserere Dominus

1076
01:03:56,881 --> 01:04:02,425
Miserere Dominus

1077
01:04:02,677 --> 01:04:06,719
Canis mortuus est

1078
01:04:06,972 --> 01:04:08,805
You said you loved him!

1079
01:04:08,847 --> 01:04:11,848
Right, Otto!
Here's a multiple choice question.

1080
01:04:12,099 --> 01:04:14,015
A. Wanda was lying.

1081
01:04:14,267 --> 01:04:16,183
B. Wanda was telling the truth.

1082
01:04:16,435 --> 01:04:18,269
Which one are you going to pick?

1083
01:04:18,520 --> 01:04:20,103
What was the first one?

1084
01:04:20,354 --> 01:04:22,187
You said you were not seeing him!

1085
01:04:22,439 --> 01:04:24,273
I knew you'd come and fuck it up!

1086
01:04:24,524 --> 01:04:26,816
I was dealing with something delicate.

1087
01:04:27,067 --> 01:04:29,234
I'm setting up a guy
who's important to us.

1088
01:04:29,485 --> 01:04:32,278
He knows where the loot is
and if you'll be arrested.

1089
01:04:32,529 --> 01:04:34,946
You lope in
like Rambo without a jockstrap

1090
01:04:35,197 --> 01:04:36,822
and dangle him from a window!

1091
01:04:37,073 --> 01:04:39,031
Now, was that smart?!

1092
01:04:39,284 --> 01:04:40,950
Was it shrewd?

1093
01:04:41,201 --> 01:04:45,286
Was it good tactics, or was it stupid?!

1094
01:04:45,537 --> 01:04:47,412
Don't call me stupid.

1095
01:04:47,663 --> 01:04:48,537
Oh, right!

1096
01:04:48,789 --> 01:04:51,623
To call you stupid
is an insult to stupid people!

1097
01:04:51,875 --> 01:04:54,166
I've known sheep that could outwit you.

1098
01:04:54,418 --> 01:04:56,418
I've worn dresses with higher IQs.

1099
01:04:56,669 --> 01:05:00,420
You think you're an intellectual,
don't you, ape?

1100
01:05:00,672 --> 01:05:02,505
Apes don't read philosophy.

1101
01:05:02,756 --> 01:05:06,465
Yes, they do.
They just don't understand it.

1102
01:05:06,717 --> 01:05:09,342
Let me correct you
on a couple of things, OK?

1103
01:05:09,594 --> 01:05:12,094
Aristotle was not Belgian.

1104
01:05:12,346 --> 01:05:14,513
The central message of Buddhism

1105
01:05:14,764 --> 01:05:17,515
- is not every man for himself.
- You read...

1106
01:05:17,766 --> 01:05:21,018
The London Underground
is not a political movement.

1107
01:05:21,268 --> 01:05:23,435
Those are mistakes. I looked 'em up.

1108
01:05:23,686 --> 01:05:26,312
Now. You have just assaulted

1109
01:05:26,563 --> 01:05:30,147
the one man who can keep you
out of jail and make you rich.

1110
01:05:30,399 --> 01:05:32,691
So what are you
going to do about it, huh?

1111
01:05:32,942 --> 01:05:35,234
What would an intellectual do?

1112
01:05:35,486 --> 01:05:38,696
What would Plato do?

1113
01:05:40,906 --> 01:05:42,197
Apologise.

1114
01:05:42,448 --> 01:05:44,198
Pardon me?

1115
01:05:44,450 --> 01:05:45,324
Apolo...

1116
01:05:45,576 --> 01:05:47,117
What?

1117
01:05:47,368 --> 01:05:48,242
Apologise!

1118
01:05:48,494 --> 01:05:50,661
Right!

1119
01:05:50,913 --> 01:05:53,371
I'm sorry.

1120
01:05:53,623 --> 01:05:54,914
No.

1121
01:05:55,165 --> 01:05:56,039
Not to me.

1122
01:05:56,290 --> 01:05:57,581
To Archie.

1123
01:05:57,833 --> 01:06:01,792
And make it good, or we're dead.

1124
01:06:06,547 --> 01:06:10,548
Oh, I'm so very,
very, very, very s...

1125
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:13,593
Fuck you!

1126
01:06:13,843 --> 01:06:15,551
I'm s...

1127
01:06:15,802 --> 01:06:18,053
I'm very, very s...

1128
01:06:18,305 --> 01:06:19,221
I'm so

1129
01:06:19,472 --> 01:06:20,804
very s...

1130
01:06:21,057 --> 01:06:25,683
Very, very s...

1131
01:06:38,026 --> 01:06:39,943
Very, very...

1132
01:06:40,194 --> 01:06:42,861
ssfff...

1133
01:07:53,283 --> 01:07:54,365
Ugh!

1134
01:07:54,616 --> 01:07:56,408
Hello, Mr Burglar!

1135
01:07:56,660 --> 01:07:58,118
Going somewhere?

1136
01:07:58,368 --> 01:07:59,909
Think you can rob Mr Leach?

1137
01:08:00,162 --> 01:08:01,995
I'll teach you a lesson.

1138
01:08:02,246 --> 01:08:04,538
He's a very good friend of mine.

1139
01:08:04,789 --> 01:08:06,080
Otto! Otto!

1140
01:08:06,332 --> 01:08:10,000
He'll be very pleased with me
when he finds you all tied up

1141
01:08:10,251 --> 01:08:13,543
and ready for the police!

1142
01:08:13,712 --> 01:08:15,545
And don't call me Otto.

1143
01:08:15,796 --> 01:08:19,380
To you, I am Mr...

1144
01:08:25,386 --> 01:08:27,595
Aagh!

1145
01:08:27,846 --> 01:08:31,138
Oh, God.

1146
01:08:32,266 --> 01:08:34,391
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1147
01:08:34,641 --> 01:08:36,391
I'm sorry.

1148
01:08:36,642 --> 01:08:38,309
Please.

1149
01:08:38,561 --> 01:08:39,643
I'm sorry.

1150
01:08:39,895 --> 01:08:41,978
I'm sorry, I didn't know it was you.

1151
01:08:42,230 --> 01:08:44,272
How could I know it was you?

1152
01:08:44,523 --> 01:08:46,899
I mean,
how could you expect me to guess?

1153
01:08:47,150 --> 01:08:48,024
Stupid jerk!

1154
01:08:48,276 --> 01:08:52,444
What the fuck are you doing
robbing your own house?

1155
01:08:52,695 --> 01:08:53,944
You asshole!

1156
01:08:54,196 --> 01:08:56,571
You stupid, stiff, pompous English...

1157
01:08:56,822 --> 01:08:58,113
Agh!

1158
01:08:58,365 --> 01:08:59,740
I'm sorry.

1159
01:08:59,991 --> 01:09:01,115
I'm sorry.

1160
01:09:01,367 --> 01:09:03,910
Er... Er...

1161
01:09:04,161 --> 01:09:07,578
Yeah.

1162
01:09:47,188 --> 01:09:49,772
God Almighty!

1163
01:09:50,023 --> 01:09:53,607
Bloody hell!

1164
01:09:59,613 --> 01:10:01,321
Darling!

1165
01:10:01,572 --> 01:10:02,988
Are you hurt?

1166
01:10:03,240 --> 01:10:07,032
Speak to me! Are you hurt?

1167
01:10:07,326 --> 01:10:08,450
Can't you speak?

1168
01:10:08,701 --> 01:10:13,412
Archie! Archie, what has happened?

1169
01:10:14,415 --> 01:10:16,289
Archie, we've been burgled.

1170
01:10:16,541 --> 01:10:17,415
Oh, no!

1171
01:10:17,667 --> 01:10:18,749
Well, are you hurt?

1172
01:10:18,999 --> 01:10:20,541
No, I'm... I'm fine.

1173
01:10:20,793 --> 01:10:22,251
Bit of a headache. I er...

1174
01:10:22,502 --> 01:10:25,086
I came in here,
somebody hit me, tied me up...

1175
01:10:25,337 --> 01:10:26,711
My God, is that the time?

1176
01:10:26,964 --> 01:10:27,796
What?

1177
01:10:28,048 --> 01:10:30,173
I didn't realise it was quite so late.

1178
01:10:30,425 --> 01:10:31,298
What?!

1179
01:10:31,550 --> 01:10:33,091
I'm late for a conference.

1180
01:10:33,343 --> 01:10:34,968
You've just been attacked!

1181
01:10:35,219 --> 01:10:37,052
It's nothing, I must fly. Sorry.

1182
01:10:37,303 --> 01:10:39,595
- Archie!
- I'll help you tidy up later!

1183
01:10:39,847 --> 01:10:41,054
Hello, Portia.

1184
01:10:41,305 --> 01:10:42,847
What's happened?

1185
01:10:43,099 --> 01:10:48,893
Your father has finally gone
completely mental.

1186
01:11:09,867 --> 01:11:12,826
Hi.

1187
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:25,959
Archie!

1188
01:11:27,169 --> 01:11:28,585
Thank you so much.

1189
01:11:28,836 --> 01:11:29,960
Champagne?

1190
01:11:30,212 --> 01:11:32,755
OK.

1191
01:11:54,061 --> 01:11:57,436
- To us.
- To us.

1192
01:11:58,814 --> 01:12:02,440
I went back to the house,
and guess who...

1193
01:12:02,692 --> 01:12:04,901
Let's make love!

1194
01:12:05,151 --> 01:12:07,234
Well, if you absolutely insist...

1195
01:12:07,486 --> 01:12:08,443
No.

1196
01:12:08,695 --> 01:12:09,569
What?

1197
01:12:09,821 --> 01:12:12,572
Here. On the rug.

1198
01:12:12,823 --> 01:12:14,198
I'll be right back.

1199
01:12:14,449 --> 01:12:16,741
Get undressed.

1200
01:12:16,992 --> 01:12:19,242
Why not?

1201
01:12:19,495 --> 01:12:22,496
Why not indeed!?

1202
01:12:23,662 --> 01:12:25,162
Afterwards...

1203
01:12:25,414 --> 01:12:26,747
Yeah?

1204
01:12:26,998 --> 01:12:28,915
...let's go to South America.

1205
01:12:29,167 --> 01:12:30,208
What?

1206
01:12:30,459 --> 01:12:32,250
Let's fly to South America.

1207
01:12:32,503 --> 01:12:33,627
Why South America?

1208
01:12:33,878 --> 01:12:37,295
OK... Iceland?

1209
01:12:39,506 --> 01:12:42,382
What do you really want out of life?

1210
01:12:42,634 --> 01:12:44,050
I don't know.

1211
01:12:44,301 --> 01:12:46,009
Why do I like you so much?

1212
01:12:46,260 --> 01:12:47,134
Archie.

1213
01:12:47,387 --> 01:12:48,260
Hm?

1214
01:12:48,513 --> 01:12:50,054
Do you speak Italian?

1215
01:12:50,305 --> 01:12:51,179
I am Italian!

1216
01:12:51,431 --> 01:12:53,556
Sono italiano in spirito.

1217
01:12:53,808 --> 01:12:57,809
Ma ho sposato una donna
che preferisce lavorare in giardino

1218
01:12:58,060 --> 01:13:00,394
a fare I'amore appassionato.

1219
01:13:00,645 --> 01:13:01,852
Uno sbaglio grande!

1220
01:13:02,105 --> 01:13:05,397
But it's such an ugly language.

1221
01:13:05,649 --> 01:13:07,524
How about... Russian?

1222
01:13:07,775 --> 01:13:13,152
Yest' sila blagodatnaya
sozvuchiy slov zhivykh.

1223
01:13:13,404 --> 01:13:19,699
Kamina tozhe ni trudnuyu tyesnitsya
lyubosyat'sya grust'.

1224
01:13:19,949 --> 01:13:25,118
Odnu molitvu chudnuyu
tverzhdaya naizust'.

1225
01:13:25,369 --> 01:13:30,746
V dushe kak bremya skatyatsya
somneniya daleko.

1226
01:13:30,998 --> 01:13:34,499
I varitsya i plachetsya, i tak legko...

1227
01:13:34,750 --> 01:13:35,749
Archie!

1228
01:13:36,001 --> 01:13:37,166
Yeah?

1229
01:13:37,419 --> 01:13:38,751
Are you rich?

1230
01:13:39,003 --> 01:13:40,502
No, no, I'm afraid not.

1231
01:13:40,754 --> 01:13:42,004
What about the house?

1232
01:13:42,255 --> 01:13:45,547
Oh, that's Wendy's. She's the rich one.

1233
01:13:45,799 --> 01:13:48,967
Oh.

1234
01:13:51,428 --> 01:13:54,970
Yest' sila blagodatnaya
sozvuchiy slov zhivykh.

1235
01:13:55,221 --> 01:14:00,515
I tushit nyeponyatnaya,
svetlaya, prelyestnaya rech'.

1236
01:14:00,767 --> 01:14:06,145
Vdushe kak bremya skatyatsya
somneniya daleko.

1237
01:14:06,396 --> 01:14:11,898
I varitsya i plachetsya, i tak legko!

1238
01:14:28,909 --> 01:14:33,911
- What the hell are you doing?
- I might ask you the same question!

1239
01:14:34,164 --> 01:14:35,038
Who are you?

1240
01:14:35,289 --> 01:14:36,163
What?!

1241
01:14:36,415 --> 01:14:37,622
Get your clothes on.

1242
01:14:37,874 --> 01:14:40,791
- Will you leave immediately, please?
- What?!

1243
01:14:41,043 --> 01:14:42,500
You're in the wrong flat.

1244
01:14:42,752 --> 01:14:44,960
This flat belongs to Patrick Balfour.

1245
01:14:45,211 --> 01:14:46,210
He's in Hong Kong.

1246
01:14:46,463 --> 01:14:48,212
He lent me the key. Now get out!

1247
01:14:48,464 --> 01:14:53,090
We leased it
from the agents last weekend.

1248
01:14:57,095 --> 01:15:01,639
Yes, well obviously
that changes things a bit. Erm...

1249
01:15:01,889 --> 01:15:05,181
Aren't you Archie Leach?

1250
01:15:05,433 --> 01:15:06,515
What?

1251
01:15:06,768 --> 01:15:09,894
You bought our house
in Lissendon Gardens.

1252
01:15:10,145 --> 01:15:14,855
Hazel and lan Johnson.

1253
01:15:15,231 --> 01:15:17,482
What a coincidence!

1254
01:15:17,732 --> 01:15:19,231
Ha...

1255
01:15:19,484 --> 01:15:23,276
How nice to see you.

1256
01:15:50,712 --> 01:15:51,878
Hello.

1257
01:15:52,129 --> 01:15:55,339
Hello, Wanda. It's Archie

1258
01:15:55,507 --> 01:15:58,132
I can't see you any more.
I've got to end it.

1259
01:15:58,384 --> 01:15:59,257
I'm sorry.

1260
01:15:59,510 --> 01:16:02,094
What?

1261
01:16:02,345 --> 01:16:05,929
I'm sorry.

1262
01:16:06,098 --> 01:16:08,848
Archie?

1263
01:16:36,950 --> 01:16:39,492
Er...

1264
01:16:39,660 --> 01:16:40,742
OK.

1265
01:16:40,995 --> 01:16:42,494
Oh, no, no. Please.

1266
01:16:42,745 --> 01:16:44,287
Look, I want to apologise.

1267
01:16:44,539 --> 01:16:45,621
I just finished it.

1268
01:16:45,871 --> 01:16:46,745
OK, OK, wait.

1269
01:16:46,998 --> 01:16:49,540
Where are you going?
I want speak with you.

1270
01:16:49,791 --> 01:16:51,708
Will you leave me alone?

1271
01:16:51,960 --> 01:16:53,376
I've ended it, all right?

1272
01:16:53,627 --> 01:16:55,460
Wait! I want to say I'm sorry.

1273
01:16:55,712 --> 01:16:57,378
It's all over, OK? It's over.

1274
01:16:57,630 --> 01:16:59,255
- All right!
- Jesus Christ!

1275
01:16:59,506 --> 01:17:01,756
- Calm down!
- Someone help me!

1276
01:17:02,009 --> 01:17:04,259
- Please believe me!
- It's all right!

1277
01:17:04,509 --> 01:17:07,302
Don't beat me up again.
I've had a terrible day.

1278
01:17:07,553 --> 01:17:08,552
Will you shut up?!

1279
01:17:08,803 --> 01:17:10,595
Jesus Christ, don't kill me!

1280
01:17:10,847 --> 01:17:12,763
Shut up, then.

1281
01:17:13,015 --> 01:17:14,472
OK.

1282
01:17:14,725 --> 01:17:15,599
Look.

1283
01:17:15,850 --> 01:17:17,516
I just want to apologise

1284
01:17:17,768 --> 01:17:19,768
sincerely

1285
01:17:20,019 --> 01:17:21,768
When I hung you from the window.

1286
01:17:22,020 --> 01:17:23,686
I'm really...

1287
01:17:23,938 --> 01:17:25,563
It was not a nice thing to do.

1288
01:17:25,814 --> 01:17:27,814
Then when I attacked you in there.

1289
01:17:28,066 --> 01:17:29,482
I'm really, s...

1290
01:17:29,734 --> 01:17:32,234
How did I know
you were robbing your house?

1291
01:17:32,485 --> 01:17:33,651
I was trying to help!

1292
01:17:33,903 --> 01:17:36,070
Yes. Thanks. Otto.

1293
01:17:36,322 --> 01:17:37,696
I wanted you to trust me.

1294
01:17:37,947 --> 01:17:40,781
Please, it was my fault.

1295
01:17:41,033 --> 01:17:42,407
- That's true.
- Yeah.

1296
01:17:42,658 --> 01:17:43,866
Now, about my sister.

1297
01:17:44,118 --> 01:17:44,992
Otto...

1298
01:17:45,243 --> 01:17:46,826
She's a very sexy girl.

1299
01:17:47,078 --> 01:17:49,245
I understand
you wanting to play around with her.

1300
01:17:49,496 --> 01:17:52,456
It's OK, I was wrong. I'm sorry!

1301
01:17:52,707 --> 01:17:53,581
I was jealous.

1302
01:17:53,833 --> 01:17:56,918
Just go ahead, pork away, pal.

1303
01:17:57,168 --> 01:17:58,208
Fuck her blue.

1304
01:17:58,460 --> 01:18:00,293
I like you, Archie.

1305
01:18:00,545 --> 01:18:03,921
I just want to help.

1306
01:19:08,505 --> 01:19:11,506
Oh, God!

1307
01:19:47,280 --> 01:19:51,573
Send for an ambulance!

1308
01:20:09,377 --> 01:20:12,295
Shocking!

1309
01:20:14,590 --> 01:20:16,089
I did it!

1310
01:20:16,339 --> 01:20:17,922
I did it! I did it!

1311
01:20:18,174 --> 01:20:20,925
Unbe-fuck-alievable!

1312
01:20:21,176 --> 01:20:22,050
Thomason!

1313
01:20:22,303 --> 01:20:24,845
Yeah?

1314
01:20:27,514 --> 01:20:30,390
You done well, my son.

1315
01:20:30,641 --> 01:20:32,141
Now, here's the plan.

1316
01:20:32,392 --> 01:20:36,018
You get four tickets
for this evening for Rio, first class.

1317
01:20:36,269 --> 01:20:38,394
- Then...
- F-f-f...

1318
01:20:38,646 --> 01:20:39,729
Yeah, four.

1319
01:20:39,980 --> 01:20:41,354
We get rid of Otto later.

1320
01:20:41,607 --> 01:20:44,316
Then, back to the flat,
pack, collect me.

1321
01:20:44,567 --> 01:20:49,736
Then to the Cathcart Towers Hotel
to pick up the jewels.

1322
01:20:51,029 --> 01:20:55,697
Unbe-fuck-alievable!

1323
01:20:55,948 --> 01:20:59,158
Oi! Oi!

1324
01:21:00,869 --> 01:21:03,453
It's so exciting,
I can't believe it!

1325
01:21:03,704 --> 01:21:05,871
He's s-s-safe.

1326
01:21:06,122 --> 01:21:09,623
I'm going to be late for court!

1327
01:21:10,249 --> 01:21:11,457
H-Hello.

1328
01:21:11,708 --> 01:21:14,250
Hello, Otto.

1329
01:21:15,044 --> 01:21:18,336
No, she just er... l-l-left.

1330
01:21:18,588 --> 01:21:20,546
Oh, and Otto...

1331
01:21:20,798 --> 01:21:24,591
You owe me a p-p-p...

1332
01:21:24,842 --> 01:21:27,468
What?

1333
01:21:27,761 --> 01:21:31,637
You owe me a p-p-pound.

1334
01:21:31,721 --> 01:21:33,429
Not Granny?

1335
01:21:33,681 --> 01:21:38,558
M-met with an accident.

1336
01:21:38,809 --> 01:21:41,894
Bullshit! You're lying.

1337
01:21:42,145 --> 01:21:43,686
Dead?

1338
01:21:43,938 --> 01:21:47,105
Heart attack.

1339
01:21:49,858 --> 01:21:51,149
I don't believe this.

1340
01:21:51,400 --> 01:21:53,859
So, George will be out this afternoon.

1341
01:21:54,111 --> 01:21:55,736
We all go out to Heathrow,

1342
01:21:55,987 --> 01:21:59,155
collect the loot and...

1343
01:21:59,323 --> 01:22:06,117
All thanks to me.

1344
01:22:06,369 --> 01:22:10,620
So the loot's at the airport, is it, Ken?

1345
01:22:19,460 --> 01:22:22,503
What's h-h-happening?

1346
01:22:22,671 --> 01:22:24,337
Well, Ken.

1347
01:22:24,588 --> 01:22:26,839
I'm going to ask you some questions

1348
01:22:27,090 --> 01:22:28,381
while I eat my chips.

1349
01:22:28,633 --> 01:22:29,882
First.

1350
01:22:30,134 --> 01:22:31,676
Who was the philosopher

1351
01:22:31,927 --> 01:22:34,719
who developed
the concept of the superman

1352
01:22:34,971 --> 01:22:38,680
in Also Spracht Zarathustra?

1353
01:22:39,056 --> 01:22:40,556
No?!

1354
01:22:40,807 --> 01:22:44,391
That's a chip up the nose, I'm afraid.

1355
01:22:44,643 --> 01:22:45,934
Friedrich Nietzsche.

1356
01:22:46,186 --> 01:22:47,561
Next.

1357
01:22:47,812 --> 01:22:50,020
In which book did Nietzsche claim

1358
01:22:50,272 --> 01:22:55,274
that almost all higher culture
is based on cruelty?

1359
01:22:55,525 --> 01:22:58,151
Are you thinking
or are you in mid-stutter?

1360
01:22:58,402 --> 01:23:01,528
You're m-mad.

1361
01:23:01,779 --> 01:23:05,822
Beyond Good And Evil.

1362
01:23:05,949 --> 01:23:07,782
I'll have to ask you an easy one.

1363
01:23:08,033 --> 01:23:09,783
OK. Erm...

1364
01:23:10,034 --> 01:23:12,243
Let me think, let me think.

1365
01:23:12,494 --> 01:23:14,870
Where are the diamonds?

1366
01:23:15,121 --> 01:23:16,745
I'll give you a clue.

1367
01:23:16,997 --> 01:23:21,039
Somewhere round the airport.

1368
01:23:22,418 --> 01:23:24,626
No hassle, there's plenty of time.

1369
01:23:24,878 --> 01:23:29,963
I'll just sit here and eat my chips
till you tell me.

1370
01:23:30,797 --> 01:23:33,506
The English contribution to world cuisine.

1371
01:23:33,757 --> 01:23:35,424
The chip.

1372
01:23:35,676 --> 01:23:38,510
What do the English
usually eat with chips

1373
01:23:38,761 --> 01:23:42,596
to make them more interesting?

1374
01:23:42,638 --> 01:23:45,972
Wait a moment!

1375
01:23:46,599 --> 01:23:50,099
It's fish, isn't it?!

1376
01:23:52,811 --> 01:23:55,103
Here, boy.

1377
01:23:55,355 --> 01:23:59,398
Down the hatch.

1378
01:24:00,984 --> 01:24:02,025
Delicious!

1379
01:24:02,277 --> 01:24:04,611
You b-b-b...

1380
01:24:04,861 --> 01:24:07,195
Better eat the green one? OK?

1381
01:24:07,446 --> 01:24:09,696
What's this one's name?

1382
01:24:09,947 --> 01:24:12,031
Well, not Wanda, anyway.

1383
01:24:12,282 --> 01:24:13,907
I'm going to call her Lunch.

1384
01:24:14,159 --> 01:24:17,868
Hello, Lunch. Hello!

1385
01:24:20,997 --> 01:24:22,705
Eugh!

1386
01:24:22,955 --> 01:24:24,872
Avoid the green ones.

1387
01:24:25,124 --> 01:24:28,292
They're not ripe yet.

1388
01:24:28,709 --> 01:24:32,960
You were in court, Inspector,
when the forensic evidence was read?

1389
01:24:33,213 --> 01:24:34,128
Yes, sir.

1390
01:24:34,380 --> 01:24:37,714
And the fact that Mr Thomason
was installing windows

1391
01:24:37,966 --> 01:24:39,591
the previous weekend,

1392
01:24:39,841 --> 01:24:47,220
would explain the presence of
small particles of glass on his trousers.

1393
01:24:47,347 --> 01:24:49,263
No hurry, Inspector.

1394
01:24:49,515 --> 01:24:52,641
Please do take your time.

1395
01:24:58,436 --> 01:25:01,020
I'm almost full.

1396
01:25:01,356 --> 01:25:02,647
Almost.

1397
01:25:02,898 --> 01:25:04,773
Stop!

1398
01:25:05,024 --> 01:25:06,899
Please, don't.

1399
01:25:07,151 --> 01:25:09,151
Come on, Wanda!

1400
01:25:09,402 --> 01:25:11,945
Gullet time!

1401
01:25:13,322 --> 01:25:16,448
What are the names
of those hotels by the airport?

1402
01:25:16,698 --> 01:25:17,906
The Airway Sheraton?

1403
01:25:18,157 --> 01:25:19,031
The Post House?

1404
01:25:19,283 --> 01:25:20,491
The Cathcart Towers?

1405
01:25:20,743 --> 01:25:24,327
The Cathcart Towers? Yes?

1406
01:25:24,578 --> 01:25:27,371
Mm? Mm?

1407
01:25:27,456 --> 01:25:28,539
Yes.

1408
01:25:28,790 --> 01:25:30,206
In the safe deposit box?

1409
01:25:30,458 --> 01:25:31,374
Yes.

1410
01:25:31,624 --> 01:25:33,249
Where's the key?

1411
01:25:33,501 --> 01:25:34,375
What?

1412
01:25:34,626 --> 01:25:35,542
Where's the key?

1413
01:25:35,794 --> 01:25:39,420
It's in the t-t-tank.

1414
01:25:39,922 --> 01:25:41,296
Where? Where?

1415
01:25:41,548 --> 01:25:43,840
In the t-t-t...

1416
01:25:44,091 --> 01:25:46,925
Treasure chest!

1417
01:25:50,011 --> 01:25:52,470
Where?!

1418
01:25:52,721 --> 01:25:53,679
Where?

1419
01:25:53,930 --> 01:25:56,013
Oh!

1420
01:25:56,266 --> 01:25:59,267
You m-m-m

1421
01:25:59,518 --> 01:26:03,602
murdering k-k-k...

1422
01:26:03,854 --> 01:26:07,229
I'll kill you, I'll kill you!

1423
01:26:08,773 --> 01:26:12,232
Sorry, Ken,
but your answer was incorrect.

1424
01:26:12,484 --> 01:26:17,570
Still, you really did think
it was in there, didn't you?

1425
01:26:18,238 --> 01:26:19,988
What?

1426
01:26:20,239 --> 01:26:23,656
Oh!

1427
01:26:29,579 --> 01:26:33,538
- Hello?
- I know where the diamonds are.

1428
01:26:33,664 --> 01:26:34,538
Where?

1429
01:26:34,790 --> 01:26:37,833
Where's the key?

1430
01:26:39,918 --> 01:26:41,084
I've got it.

1431
01:26:41,336 --> 01:26:44,879
When can you get
to George's apartment?

1432
01:26:45,130 --> 01:26:47,088
You are Wanda Gershwitz,

1433
01:26:47,339 --> 01:26:51,007
of Kipling Mansions,
Murray Road, London W9?

1434
01:26:51,259 --> 01:26:53,092
Yes.

1435
01:26:53,343 --> 01:26:54,926
Would you tell the court,

1436
01:26:55,179 --> 01:26:57,095
how do you know the defendant?

1437
01:26:57,346 --> 01:27:00,930
We've had a relationship for two years.

1438
01:27:01,182 --> 01:27:02,723
Relationship?

1439
01:27:02,974 --> 01:27:07,017
We're lovers, your lord.

1440
01:27:07,853 --> 01:27:11,228
Miss Gershwitz,
on 4th March of this year,

1441
01:27:11,481 --> 01:27:12,730
in the morning,

1442
01:27:12,981 --> 01:27:13,938
where were you?

1443
01:27:14,191 --> 01:27:16,107
At the apartment at Murray Road.

1444
01:27:16,358 --> 01:27:19,650
And were you by yourself,
or was anyone else present?

1445
01:27:19,902 --> 01:27:22,110
No. Somebody else was there.

1446
01:27:22,362 --> 01:27:23,737
Who was that?

1447
01:27:23,988 --> 01:27:25,279
My brother.

1448
01:27:25,531 --> 01:27:28,074
Did your b...?

1449
01:27:30,910 --> 01:27:33,577
Your brother?

1450
01:27:33,828 --> 01:27:37,287
My brother.

1451
01:27:37,997 --> 01:27:40,873
Yes.

1452
01:27:40,916 --> 01:27:43,416
Yes, and...

1453
01:27:43,667 --> 01:27:45,959
Are you quite sure it was your brother?

1454
01:27:46,211 --> 01:27:48,544
I'm sure she can recognise her brother.

1455
01:27:48,797 --> 01:27:53,340
She's had a relationship
with him all her life.

1456
01:27:54,091 --> 01:27:56,424
Much obliged, my lord.

1457
01:27:56,675 --> 01:28:00,760
W-w-was there
anyone else present that morning?

1458
01:28:01,012 --> 01:28:03,012
Yes, George was there.

1459
01:28:03,263 --> 01:28:04,554
But he left about 6.55.

1460
01:28:04,807 --> 01:28:06,473
Wanda!

1461
01:28:06,724 --> 01:28:08,641
I-I wonder...

1462
01:28:08,892 --> 01:28:12,309
I wonder...

1463
01:28:12,310 --> 01:28:15,478
I wonder...

1464
01:28:22,401 --> 01:28:25,235
Yes, Mr Leach?

1465
01:28:25,486 --> 01:28:26,819
I Wendy... I Wanda...

1466
01:28:27,070 --> 01:28:28,569
I wonder... I w-w-w

1467
01:28:28,821 --> 01:28:31,822
Wh-when you say 6.55,

1468
01:28:32,073 --> 01:28:34,323
Miss er... Gershwitz,

1469
01:28:34,575 --> 01:28:37,159
how can you be so sure?

1470
01:28:37,411 --> 01:28:39,077
Oh, I looked at the clock.

1471
01:28:39,328 --> 01:28:40,619
Cos I said to myself,

1472
01:28:40,871 --> 01:28:44,497
'Where could he be going at 6.55
with that sawn-off shotgun?'

1473
01:28:44,747 --> 01:28:46,539
Darling!

1474
01:28:46,791 --> 01:28:48,207
Mr Leach.

1475
01:28:48,458 --> 01:28:49,416
Darling?

1476
01:28:49,668 --> 01:28:50,750
Yes, dear?

1477
01:28:51,003 --> 01:28:51,876
You bitch!

1478
01:28:52,128 --> 01:28:55,129
You fucking bitch!

1479
01:28:57,881 --> 01:29:00,632
Restrain that man!

1480
01:29:05,553 --> 01:29:06,510
Restrain this man.

1481
01:29:06,762 --> 01:29:07,970
Come 'ere, you bastard!

1482
01:29:08,221 --> 01:29:11,180
Clear the court!
I'm adjourning this for an hour.

1483
01:29:11,432 --> 01:29:15,141
Clear the court!

1484
01:29:23,231 --> 01:29:24,439
Clear the court!

1485
01:29:24,690 --> 01:29:26,815
Clear the court! Clear the court!

1486
01:29:27,067 --> 01:29:30,609
Officers, arrest that man!

1487
01:29:35,156 --> 01:29:39,532
Clear the court! Clear the court!

1488
01:29:49,206 --> 01:29:51,165
Bloody hell!

1489
01:29:51,416 --> 01:29:54,208
It's my husband, he's been hit.

1490
01:29:54,460 --> 01:29:55,667
Ah, you made it. Good.

1491
01:29:55,918 --> 01:29:59,210
A bit of a knock, I'm afraid.

1492
01:29:59,504 --> 01:30:02,422
I have never been
so humiliated in my life.

1493
01:30:02,673 --> 01:30:05,758
You can stick this marriage
right in your bottom!

1494
01:30:06,009 --> 01:30:08,968
I'll see you in court.

1495
01:30:17,265 --> 01:30:19,807
Yes.

1496
01:30:20,601 --> 01:30:22,434
Well.

1497
01:30:22,686 --> 01:30:25,812
That's it, then.

1498
01:30:27,898 --> 01:30:28,938
George.

1499
01:30:29,191 --> 01:30:31,399
- What?
- We've got to talk.

1500
01:30:31,650 --> 01:30:33,441
Tell those pigs to fuck off.

1501
01:30:33,692 --> 01:30:36,526
Fuck off, pigs.

1502
01:30:38,321 --> 01:30:39,737
Did you hear what I said?

1503
01:30:39,988 --> 01:30:42,530
Fuck off.

1504
01:30:46,409 --> 01:30:47,867
What's she up to, George?

1505
01:30:48,118 --> 01:30:49,952
What are you up to?

1506
01:30:50,203 --> 01:30:51,911
You called her darling,

1507
01:30:52,163 --> 01:30:53,162
and Wanda.

1508
01:30:53,413 --> 01:30:56,373
I've been helping her
get her evidence straight.

1509
01:30:56,624 --> 01:30:57,623
It slipped out.

1510
01:30:57,875 --> 01:30:59,500
Have you been coaching her?

1511
01:30:59,751 --> 01:31:02,251
What do you think?!
We've got ten minutes.

1512
01:31:02,504 --> 01:31:04,420
They'll find you guilty, right?

1513
01:31:04,672 --> 01:31:08,047
Plead guilty now, tell them
where the loot is, you may get

1514
01:31:08,298 --> 01:31:10,465
eight years, out in five and a half.

1515
01:31:10,716 --> 01:31:13,509
What if I tell them about Otto...
and Wanda?

1516
01:31:13,760 --> 01:31:15,259
- They both did it?
- Yeah.

1517
01:31:15,512 --> 01:31:16,511
Great, all right.

1518
01:31:16,762 --> 01:31:18,470
Maybe six years, out in four?

1519
01:31:18,722 --> 01:31:21,431
So where are the diamonds?

1520
01:31:21,683 --> 01:31:23,265
Where's Bartlett?

1521
01:31:23,516 --> 01:31:25,349
Upstairs, calming things down.

1522
01:31:25,600 --> 01:31:26,641
So, where are they?

1523
01:31:26,893 --> 01:31:30,769
Tell Bartlett Ken knows where they are.

1524
01:31:31,021 --> 01:31:36,607
George, it'd be a lot quicker
if you told me.

1525
01:31:37,317 --> 01:31:39,150
OK! I'll tell Bartlett.

1526
01:31:39,402 --> 01:31:41,026
Where's Ken?

1527
01:31:41,278 --> 01:31:44,070
He's at the flat.

1528
01:31:48,241 --> 01:31:49,824
Thank you for all your help.

1529
01:31:50,075 --> 01:31:52,742
I'll be right out.

1530
01:32:06,377 --> 01:32:07,918
Taxi! Taxi!

1531
01:32:08,170 --> 01:32:09,086
Please... shit!

1532
01:32:09,337 --> 01:32:10,503
Taxi!

1533
01:32:10,755 --> 01:32:11,796
Come on.

1534
01:32:12,047 --> 01:32:13,046
- What?
- Let's go.

1535
01:32:13,299 --> 01:32:14,673
- Where?
- Buenos Aires.

1536
01:32:14,924 --> 01:32:17,633
- What?
- We're going to George's flat first.

1537
01:32:17,884 --> 01:32:21,176
Get in.

1538
01:32:22,679 --> 01:32:23,761
Got your passport?

1539
01:32:24,014 --> 01:32:24,887
Yeah.

1540
01:32:25,139 --> 01:32:27,139
Check the briefcase for mine.

1541
01:32:27,391 --> 01:32:30,350
Get your head down.

1542
01:32:34,686 --> 01:32:38,103
So, you robbed the jeweller's,
turned one lover in,

1543
01:32:38,355 --> 01:32:41,064
and kept one to help you
find the diamonds.

1544
01:32:41,316 --> 01:32:43,858
When he does,
you commit perjury in court.

1545
01:32:44,110 --> 01:32:45,818
Everyone does it in America.

1546
01:32:46,069 --> 01:32:47,193
Not in this country!

1547
01:32:47,446 --> 01:32:49,446
Right! Nobody lies in England.

1548
01:32:49,697 --> 01:32:53,698
- Like Margaret Thatcher never lied.
- You lied to me from the start.

1549
01:32:53,949 --> 01:32:59,160
- You just wanted to get me into bed.
- I fell in love with you!

1550
01:33:02,371 --> 01:33:05,039
How come you dumped me, then?

1551
01:33:05,290 --> 01:33:08,874
I wasn't rich enough, remember?

1552
01:33:19,090 --> 01:33:20,632
Say something in Russian.

1553
01:33:20,883 --> 01:33:23,425
No!

1554
01:33:26,845 --> 01:33:28,637
What are you thinking, Archie?

1555
01:33:28,888 --> 01:33:31,138
I'm trying to find one good reason

1556
01:33:31,389 --> 01:33:33,556
why I should take you away with me.

1557
01:33:33,807 --> 01:33:35,474
How about

1558
01:33:35,726 --> 01:33:39,352
because I have the key
to the safety deposit box.

1559
01:33:39,604 --> 01:33:43,438
That's a good reason!

1560
01:33:45,649 --> 01:33:47,023
What do we do about Otto?

1561
01:33:47,274 --> 01:33:48,273
I'll handle Otto.

1562
01:33:48,525 --> 01:33:50,901
Be careful, he's dangerous.

1563
01:33:51,152 --> 01:33:52,360
So am I.

1564
01:33:52,612 --> 01:33:55,780
Keep it running.

1565
01:33:57,782 --> 01:33:59,865
- Why did you bring him?
- Otto, wait!

1566
01:34:00,116 --> 01:34:02,784
- I'm beginning to think you like him!
- Wait!

1567
01:34:03,035 --> 01:34:04,493
Let's get the diamonds!

1568
01:34:04,744 --> 01:34:06,410
Ken!

1569
01:34:06,662 --> 01:34:09,204
Are you Ken?

1570
01:34:10,331 --> 01:34:11,205
How do you do?

1571
01:34:11,457 --> 01:34:14,583
I'm George's barrister.

1572
01:34:16,252 --> 01:34:17,125
Oh, my God!

1573
01:34:17,378 --> 01:34:18,627
Asshole!

1574
01:34:18,878 --> 01:34:21,128
What the bloody hell...

1575
01:34:21,380 --> 01:34:24,214
Oh, all right, then.

1576
01:34:24,465 --> 01:34:27,383
Archie!

1577
01:34:27,634 --> 01:34:28,841
Where have they gone?

1578
01:34:29,094 --> 01:34:30,802
Quick! Where have they gone?

1579
01:34:31,053 --> 01:34:32,970
They've go... they've go...

1580
01:34:33,221 --> 01:34:35,596
What?

1581
01:34:35,847 --> 01:34:37,597
Are you all right?

1582
01:34:37,848 --> 01:34:39,056
Where have they gone?

1583
01:34:39,307 --> 01:34:40,598
They've gone to the

1584
01:34:40,850 --> 01:34:41,891
the Ca-ca-ca...

1585
01:34:42,143 --> 01:34:43,560
- Are you ill?
- No, no, no.

1586
01:34:43,811 --> 01:34:44,726
What?

1587
01:34:44,979 --> 01:34:45,852
Ca-ca-ca...

1588
01:34:46,104 --> 01:34:47,395
Have you got a stutter?

1589
01:34:47,647 --> 01:34:49,730
Yeah, I have. A bit.

1590
01:34:49,982 --> 01:34:51,356
OK, fine. Don't worry.

1591
01:34:51,608 --> 01:34:53,441
Do you know where they've gone?

1592
01:34:53,692 --> 01:34:54,566
Yeah.

1593
01:34:54,818 --> 01:34:56,150
Fine, fine. Where?

1594
01:34:56,402 --> 01:34:59,319
The Ca-ca

1595
01:34:59,571 --> 01:35:01,070
Hotel.

1596
01:35:01,322 --> 01:35:02,196
Hotel?

1597
01:35:02,447 --> 01:35:04,990
Which hotel?

1598
01:35:05,158 --> 01:35:06,783
Ca

1599
01:35:07,034 --> 01:35:09,034
The Ca... The Ca...

1600
01:35:09,286 --> 01:35:10,618
Go on, go on.

1601
01:35:10,870 --> 01:35:11,743
Ca-ca-ca...

1602
01:35:11,996 --> 01:35:12,870
It's OK.

1603
01:35:13,121 --> 01:35:15,496
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

1604
01:35:15,747 --> 01:35:17,664
Slowly. Very slowly.

1605
01:35:17,916 --> 01:35:20,458
Slowly.

1606
01:35:21,210 --> 01:35:24,128
The Ca

1607
01:35:24,254 --> 01:35:26,462
The Caa

1608
01:35:26,714 --> 01:35:27,588
The

1609
01:35:27,840 --> 01:35:29,339
Ca

1610
01:35:29,590 --> 01:35:30,672
The Caa...

1611
01:35:30,924 --> 01:35:31,798
No hurry.

1612
01:35:32,049 --> 01:35:33,549
The C-C-Caaa...

1613
01:35:33,801 --> 01:35:35,259
Sing it. Sing.

1614
01:35:35,510 --> 01:35:37,635
The Caa

1615
01:35:37,888 --> 01:35:39,220
The Caa

1616
01:35:39,471 --> 01:35:42,681
The Caa, the Caa

1617
01:35:42,724 --> 01:35:43,598
Caa

1618
01:35:43,850 --> 01:35:44,724
Plenty of time.

1619
01:35:44,975 --> 01:35:47,017
Caa

1620
01:35:47,268 --> 01:35:48,142
Caa

1621
01:35:48,393 --> 01:35:49,267
The Caa

1622
01:35:49,519 --> 01:35:50,768
Oh, come on!

1623
01:35:51,021 --> 01:35:52,395
Sorry. I'm sorry.

1624
01:35:52,646 --> 01:35:55,189
Erm...

1625
01:35:55,190 --> 01:35:58,565
The Caa

1626
01:35:59,401 --> 01:36:02,693
Here. Write it.

1627
01:36:12,701 --> 01:36:14,409
Cathcart Towers Hotel?

1628
01:36:14,660 --> 01:36:16,035
Cathcart Towers Hotel.

1629
01:36:16,287 --> 01:36:18,329
Where is it?

1630
01:36:18,580 --> 01:36:20,038
Ken, where is it? Where?!

1631
01:36:20,290 --> 01:36:21,456
Hea-Hea-Hea...

1632
01:36:21,706 --> 01:36:23,080
Here. Again.

1633
01:36:23,333 --> 01:36:26,083
No, no, no.

1634
01:36:32,547 --> 01:36:35,298
Heathrow Airport.

1635
01:36:45,847 --> 01:36:47,430
Hey! What's the idea?

1636
01:36:47,681 --> 01:36:48,680
You can't stay...

1637
01:36:48,933 --> 01:36:53,017
Terribly sorry. Take it, it's yours.

1638
01:36:58,772 --> 01:36:59,771
Thank you so much.

1639
01:37:00,023 --> 01:37:01,940
Er... British Airways to Rio.

1640
01:37:02,191 --> 01:37:03,732
Rio? Terminal Four.

1641
01:37:03,983 --> 01:37:07,151
Thank you.

1642
01:37:11,155 --> 01:37:13,405
Excuse me, sir. Is this your vehicle?

1643
01:37:13,657 --> 01:37:15,281
I'll be with you in a moment.

1644
01:37:15,533 --> 01:37:17,449
I'll be right back.

1645
01:37:17,700 --> 01:37:20,034
Aisle or window?
Smoking or non-smoking?

1646
01:37:20,285 --> 01:37:21,660
What was the middle one?

1647
01:37:21,912 --> 01:37:24,037
Anything in non-smoking, thanks.

1648
01:37:24,288 --> 01:37:27,331
Gate 14 is boarding now.

1649
01:37:49,263 --> 01:37:51,054
Rio!

1650
01:37:51,305 --> 01:37:54,181
Otto, don't look back,
there's a cop behind us.

1651
01:37:54,432 --> 01:37:56,975
Quick!

1652
01:37:59,936 --> 01:38:01,853
Yes, we can just do it, Mr Leach.

1653
01:38:02,105 --> 01:38:02,979
Great.

1654
01:38:03,230 --> 01:38:06,273
Luggage?

1655
01:38:07,899 --> 01:38:09,440
Don't really need any.

1656
01:38:09,692 --> 01:38:12,943
- Gate 14.
- Thank you.

1657
01:38:13,278 --> 01:38:16,695
Ciao, stupidissimo.

1658
01:38:22,118 --> 01:38:24,118
Ow!

1659
01:38:24,368 --> 01:38:27,619
Aargh!

1660
01:38:45,007 --> 01:38:46,840
Come on, Archie.

1661
01:38:47,091 --> 01:38:49,842
Pick up the phone.

1662
01:38:55,597 --> 01:38:57,555
Ticket, sir. Airport security.

1663
01:38:57,807 --> 01:38:59,515
May I see your boarding pass?

1664
01:38:59,765 --> 01:39:01,307
Oh, yes. Certainly.

1665
01:39:01,559 --> 01:39:04,893
Very good. Would you mind
stepping over here, please?

1666
01:39:05,145 --> 01:39:05,852
Of course.

1667
01:39:06,103 --> 01:39:09,520
- Oh, look, the Queen.
- Where?

1668
01:39:13,025 --> 01:39:14,941
OK, OK, OK, don't get excited.

1669
01:39:15,193 --> 01:39:18,402
OK, OK, OK.

1670
01:39:18,944 --> 01:39:21,945
Oh, it's you!
I was actually worried for a minute.

1671
01:39:22,197 --> 01:39:23,821
- Keep your hands up.
- No!

1672
01:39:24,073 --> 01:39:26,324
- Put 'em up!
- I'll make a deal with you.

1673
01:39:26,575 --> 01:39:27,657
I'll put one up.

1674
01:39:27,910 --> 01:39:30,076
Put the other one up!

1675
01:39:30,328 --> 01:39:33,245
Which looks better?

1676
01:39:33,497 --> 01:39:35,789
I'm warning you, Otto.

1677
01:39:36,039 --> 01:39:37,455
What are you going to do?

1678
01:39:37,707 --> 01:39:40,792
Shoot me? Gun me down in cold blood,
like a dog? Hey?

1679
01:39:41,043 --> 01:39:45,085
If you want to settle something,
fight me. You're a man.

1680
01:39:45,337 --> 01:39:48,379
Let's fight like men! Come on!

1681
01:39:48,631 --> 01:39:50,089
All right.

1682
01:39:50,341 --> 01:39:52,132
All right, then.

1683
01:39:52,382 --> 01:39:54,216
OK. OK.

1684
01:39:54,467 --> 01:39:56,175
You look good, Arch.

1685
01:39:56,427 --> 01:39:58,677
That's right. I used to box for Oxford.

1686
01:39:58,929 --> 01:40:01,346
Oh, yeah?
Well, I used to kill for the CIA.

1687
01:40:01,597 --> 01:40:03,889
Now, get your hands up.

1688
01:40:04,141 --> 01:40:06,683
No.

1689
01:40:08,060 --> 01:40:10,727
You spineless bimbo.

1690
01:40:10,977 --> 01:40:14,561
Now, out.

1691
01:40:17,066 --> 01:40:19,608
I'm going to have
to shoot you now, Archie.

1692
01:40:19,859 --> 01:40:22,151
But I've got a little time
before my plane leaves

1693
01:40:22,402 --> 01:40:24,486
and I'm longing to humiliate you.

1694
01:40:24,737 --> 01:40:28,113
So get in that barrel.

1695
01:40:28,489 --> 01:40:29,363
What?

1696
01:40:29,615 --> 01:40:32,157
In the barrel.

1697
01:40:34,952 --> 01:40:38,120
Right.

1698
01:40:39,080 --> 01:40:39,954
You English!

1699
01:40:40,206 --> 01:40:42,665
You think you're so superior, don't you?

1700
01:40:42,916 --> 01:40:45,333
Well, you're the filth of the planet.

1701
01:40:45,583 --> 01:40:47,708
A bunch of pompous,

1702
01:40:47,960 --> 01:40:50,585
badly-dressed, poverty-stricken,

1703
01:40:50,837 --> 01:40:54,921
sexually repressed football hooligans.

1704
01:40:55,173 --> 01:40:56,548
Goodbye, Archie.

1705
01:40:56,799 --> 01:40:59,174
At least we're not irretrievably vulgar.

1706
01:40:59,427 --> 01:41:01,802
Your problem is you don't like winners.

1707
01:41:02,052 --> 01:41:03,218
- Winners?
- Yeah.

1708
01:41:03,469 --> 01:41:04,510
Winners.

1709
01:41:04,762 --> 01:41:05,845
Winners like

1710
01:41:06,097 --> 01:41:07,138
North Vietnam?

1711
01:41:07,389 --> 01:41:08,596
Shut up!

1712
01:41:08,849 --> 01:41:10,306
We did not lose Vietnam!

1713
01:41:10,558 --> 01:41:11,640
It was a tie!

1714
01:41:11,892 --> 01:41:14,893
I'm telling ya, baby,
they kicked a little ass there.

1715
01:41:15,145 --> 01:41:19,521
Boy, they whupped
your hide real good!

1716
01:41:19,772 --> 01:41:20,646
No, they didn't.

1717
01:41:20,897 --> 01:41:22,647
- Oh, yes, they did.
- No, they didn't.

1718
01:41:22,899 --> 01:41:24,524
Oh, yes, they did.

1719
01:41:24,775 --> 01:41:26,275
Oh, no they...

1720
01:41:26,526 --> 01:41:28,276
Shut up!

1721
01:41:28,528 --> 01:41:29,527
Goodbye, Archie.

1722
01:41:29,778 --> 01:41:31,069
Are you gonna shoot me?

1723
01:41:31,321 --> 01:41:33,447
Er yes, I'm afraid so, old chap.

1724
01:41:33,698 --> 01:41:34,613
Sorry!

1725
01:41:34,866 --> 01:41:37,450
Look, Otto. Look.

1726
01:41:43,537 --> 01:41:47,747
Revenge.

1727
01:41:49,791 --> 01:41:51,166
It's K-K-Ken!

1728
01:41:51,418 --> 01:41:54,210
C-c-coming to k-k-kill me.

1729
01:41:54,462 --> 01:41:59,505
How are you going to c-c-catch me,
K-K-Ken?

1730
01:42:00,089 --> 01:42:01,213
Now, where was I?

1731
01:42:01,466 --> 01:42:04,425
Oh, yeah.

1732
01:42:04,843 --> 01:42:07,886
Shit! God!

1733
01:42:08,137 --> 01:42:12,138
Fucking limey cement!

1734
01:42:19,143 --> 01:42:20,100
Ken! Ken!

1735
01:42:20,352 --> 01:42:22,311
Wait, wait, Ken!

1736
01:42:22,562 --> 01:42:24,812
Kenny! May I call you Kenny?

1737
01:42:25,065 --> 01:42:25,980
Remember Wanda?

1738
01:42:26,231 --> 01:42:27,773
I got the deal of a lifetime!

1739
01:42:28,025 --> 01:42:29,357
50-50. What do you say?

1740
01:42:29,609 --> 01:42:31,609
OK, OK, 60-40.

1741
01:42:31,860 --> 01:42:33,151
That's my final offer.

1742
01:42:33,402 --> 01:42:34,318
Revenge!

1743
01:42:34,570 --> 01:42:35,652
Wait, I got an idea.

1744
01:42:35,904 --> 01:42:37,153
You take it all.

1745
01:42:37,405 --> 01:42:39,572
Here's my boarding pass. Ken!

1746
01:42:39,823 --> 01:42:42,699
I'm gonna... I'm gonna k-k-kill you.

1747
01:42:42,950 --> 01:42:44,367
OK, fine, Ken. Come at me.

1748
01:42:44,619 --> 01:42:45,951
Give me your best shot.

1749
01:42:46,203 --> 01:42:48,119
Go on, you don't have the guts.

1750
01:42:48,371 --> 01:42:51,288
Admit it.

1751
01:42:51,872 --> 01:42:53,080
OK, you have the guts.

1752
01:42:53,332 --> 01:42:54,706
Good. Wait.

1753
01:42:54,958 --> 01:42:56,333
Death!

1754
01:42:56,584 --> 01:42:59,502
All right, I'm sorry
I ate your fish, OK?!

1755
01:42:59,753 --> 01:43:00,794
I'm sorry!

1756
01:43:01,046 --> 01:43:02,087
Revenge!

1757
01:43:02,338 --> 01:43:03,962
Jesus, I said I'm sorry.

1758
01:43:04,215 --> 01:43:07,757
What the fu...? Aaagh!

1759
01:43:09,425 --> 01:43:11,884
Got him!

1760
01:43:20,767 --> 01:43:22,684
Gotcha again!

1761
01:43:22,934 --> 01:43:24,809
You bastard!

1762
01:43:25,060 --> 01:43:28,394
Hey! I've lost my stutter.

1763
01:43:28,646 --> 01:43:29,728
It's gone.

1764
01:43:29,980 --> 01:43:30,854
I can speak.

1765
01:43:31,107 --> 01:43:33,565
How much wood could
a woodchuck chuck,

1766
01:43:33,817 --> 01:43:37,567
if a woodchuck could chuck wood?

1767
01:43:37,611 --> 01:43:38,652
Good afternoon, sir.

1768
01:43:38,903 --> 01:43:41,445
Boarding pass?

1769
01:43:48,200 --> 01:43:51,659
Buongiorno, signorina.

1770
01:43:58,623 --> 01:44:00,081
Now, listen. Two things.

1771
01:44:00,333 --> 01:44:01,791
One.

1772
01:44:02,042 --> 01:44:06,794
Behave yourself from now on,
or I'll break your neck, OK.

1773
01:44:07,046 --> 01:44:09,255
Two.

1774
01:44:09,506 --> 01:44:10,880
Gorbachov.

1775
01:44:11,132 --> 01:44:12,548
Glasnost.

1776
01:44:12,800 --> 01:44:15,509
Molotov.

1777
01:44:15,509 --> 01:44:17,342
Blinis.

1778
01:44:17,593 --> 01:44:19,802
Er... Lenin.

1779
01:44:20,054 --> 01:44:22,138
Pushkin.

1780
01:44:22,389 --> 01:44:23,471
Chicken Kiev.

1781
01:44:23,723 --> 01:44:25,973
Good. Dostoevsky.

1782
01:44:26,225 --> 01:44:29,351
Roubles.

1783
01:44:30,394 --> 01:44:33,603
Vladivostok.

1784
01:44:36,773 --> 01:44:43,818
Assho-o-ole!
