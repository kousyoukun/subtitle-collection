00:00:24,189 --> 00:00:26,590
And on that point,
members of the jury,...

3
00:00:26,625 --> 00:00:28,349
.. I rest my case.

4
00:01:20,346 --> 00:01:21,946
Hello, Wanda.

00:02:31,981 --> 00:02:33,381
Hi, Ken.

7
00:02:33,421 --> 00:02:35,181
Hello, W-W-Wanda.

8
00:02:35,341 --> 00:02:36,741
Ken,...

9
00:02:37,741 --> 00:02:38,666
.. this is Otto.

10
00:02:38,701 --> 00:02:41,581
Hello, Ken.
Wanda's told me a lot about you.

11
00:02:41,616 --> 00:02:43,300
Hey! Great fish!

12
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:46,620
A squeeze of lemon,
some tartare sauce... perfect!

13
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:49,224
George back yet?

14
00:02:49,259 --> 00:02:51,260
No, he had to g-g-go...

15
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:53,419
.. to the b-b-b...

16
00:02:56,459 --> 00:02:57,384
What?

17
00:02:57,419 --> 00:03:00,340
That's quite a stutter you've got there,
Ken.

18
00:03:01,259 --> 00:03:03,659
It's all right, it doesn't bother me.

19
00:03:03,694 --> 00:03:06,379
So er...
George needs a weapons man, eh?

20
00:03:07,499 --> 00:03:08,459
A cup of tea, Ken?

21
00:03:08,494 --> 00:03:09,859
Y- y-y...

22
00:03:10,378 --> 00:03:11,783
Yeah, he'd like one.

23
00:03:11,818 --> 00:03:14,699
I had a good friend in the CIA,
had a stutter.

24
00:03:14,734 --> 00:03:16,619
Cost him his life, dammit.

25
00:03:19,498 --> 00:03:21,018
Hi, George.

26
00:03:22,378 --> 00:03:24,018
Hello, George.

27
00:03:24,297 --> 00:03:25,738
Get you a Scotch?

28
00:03:25,773 --> 00:03:27,017
Yeah.

29
00:03:27,178 --> 00:03:28,697
George,...

30
00:03:29,578 --> 00:03:31,257
.. this is Otto.

31
00:03:31,977 --> 00:03:33,337
So,...

32
00:03:33,417 --> 00:03:35,096
.. you're Wanda's brother?

33
00:03:35,131 --> 00:03:36,914
Good to be here, George.

34
00:03:36,949 --> 00:03:38,963
England is a fine country.

35
00:03:38,998 --> 00:03:40,977
Did she tell you what we need?

36
00:03:49,256 --> 00:03:51,416
Something like that?

37
00:03:53,576 --> 00:03:55,456
Something like that.

38
00:03:56,935 --> 00:03:58,536
Hello, Wendy.

39
00:04:00,775 --> 00:04:02,456
Had a good day?

40
00:04:02,696 --> 00:04:06,016
I spend the morning
trying to get a waste disposal man.

41
00:04:06,055 --> 00:04:09,375
At lunch, Marjorie just
complained about her husband...

42
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:12,514
.. then I have to play
three rubbers with Philippa.

43
00:04:12,549 --> 00:04:15,614
I come back and
Sandersons have sent the wrong flowers.

44
00:04:15,655 --> 00:04:17,014
Oh, no!

45
00:04:18,054 --> 00:04:20,094
Would you like some tea?

46
00:04:20,934 --> 00:04:22,174
Yes.

47
00:04:23,333 --> 00:04:24,738
I won the case.

48
00:04:24,773 --> 00:04:27,973
This is the first moment
I've had to myself all day.

49
00:04:31,493 --> 00:04:33,378
Hello, Portia! How was the show?

50
00:04:33,413 --> 00:04:35,778
Awful, Daddy. I must have a new horse.

51
00:04:35,813 --> 00:04:38,693
- But you liked Phantom.
- He's not fit for dog meat.

52
00:04:38,728 --> 00:04:41,058
Can I change him? It won't cost much.

53
00:04:41,093 --> 00:04:43,493
- Oughtn't we...
- I thought you were making tea.

54
00:04:43,528 --> 00:04:46,090
- I am, darling. Sorry.
- I'd better get it.

55
00:04:46,125 --> 00:04:48,652
- No, no, let me do it.
- No! I'll do it!

56
00:04:51,652 --> 00:04:53,057
I won the case.

57
00:04:53,092 --> 00:04:54,972
Now this is cracked.

58
00:04:56,452 --> 00:04:58,892
They're worth about 100,000 each.

59
00:04:59,811 --> 00:05:01,697
There are 135 of them.

60
00:05:01,732 --> 00:05:04,252
That makes 13 millions, my friends.

61
00:05:04,611 --> 00:05:05,571
Dollars or pounds?

62
00:05:05,606 --> 00:05:06,976
Pounds, pet.

63
00:05:07,011 --> 00:05:09,131
This is the big one. So...

64
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:12,050
OK.

65
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:14,050
Yeah.

66
00:05:15,171 --> 00:05:16,450
Otto?

67
00:05:17,091 --> 00:05:18,330
Yes?

68
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:19,650
OK?

69
00:05:19,685 --> 00:05:20,770
What?

70
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:22,335
The plan.

71
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:24,409
Yeah. Great. No problem.

72
00:05:24,769 --> 00:05:27,650
What was the middle thing,
about the police?

73
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:31,489
We don't meet up
at Heathrow until Tuesday...

74
00:05:31,524 --> 00:05:32,414
Yeah, yeah!

75
00:05:32,449 --> 00:05:34,334
I haven't finished yet.

76
00:05:34,369 --> 00:05:37,889
Because the police will watch
all the airports for 72 hours.

77
00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:40,529
I know.

78
00:05:41,089 --> 00:05:43,288
Do you want me to g-g-get...

79
00:05:43,969 --> 00:05:45,609
.. a b-b-big...

80
00:05:46,368 --> 00:05:47,849
.. c-c-car?

81
00:05:49,248 --> 00:05:50,648
Getaway?

82
00:05:50,689 --> 00:05:52,093
A limo, OK?

83
00:05:52,128 --> 00:05:54,013
And put diplomatic plates on it.

84
00:05:54,048 --> 00:05:56,727
What if he has to speak in the break-in?

85
00:05:56,928 --> 00:05:59,327
Nobody says anything during a break-in.

86
00:05:59,362 --> 00:06:01,447
It's OK, Otto. Ken's good.

87
00:06:02,208 --> 00:06:04,008
So, next week,...

88
00:06:04,608 --> 00:06:06,767
.. we won't have to look for work.

89
00:06:06,802 --> 00:06:08,927
And it won't have to look for us.

90
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:10,967
Oscar Wilde.

91
00:06:15,647 --> 00:06:18,326
You really like animals, don't you, Ken?

92
00:06:18,526 --> 00:06:20,206
What's the attraction?

93
00:06:20,241 --> 00:06:21,851
Because you can t-t-t...

94
00:06:21,886 --> 00:06:24,566
.. trust them, and they don't sh-sh-sh...

95
00:06:25,245 --> 00:06:26,651
Shit on you?

96
00:06:26,686 --> 00:06:28,646
Show off all the time.

97
00:06:29,086 --> 00:06:31,485
You know what Nietzsche
said about them?

98
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,885
He said they were God's second blunder.

99
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,325
Bye, sis!

100
00:06:35,805 --> 00:06:38,485
Well, you tell him from me that I-I-I...

101
00:06:40,125 --> 00:06:41,685
Bye, George.

102
00:06:42,045 --> 00:06:44,204
If you talk to Mom, tell her I said hi.

103
00:06:44,239 --> 00:06:46,501
OK.

104
00:06:46,536 --> 00:06:48,764
One more day, and we're together.

105
00:06:51,645 --> 00:06:53,564
I'm sorry about my brother, Ken.

106
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:55,604
I know he's insensitive.

107
00:06:55,964 --> 00:06:57,943
He's had a hard life.

108
00:06:57,978 --> 00:06:59,923
Dad used to beat him up.

109
00:07:03,164 --> 00:07:04,443
Good.

110
00:07:05,084 --> 00:07:06,329
Aaagh!

111
00:08:26,478 --> 00:08:28,758
Anybody moves and you're dead.

112
00:08:58,157 --> 00:09:00,196
Look where you're going!

113
00:09:00,556 --> 00:09:01,961
Chauvinist pig!

114
00:09:01,996 --> 00:09:05,235
Really, people here
just think they own the pavement.

115
00:09:32,514 --> 00:09:33,439
That was fun.

116
00:09:33,474 --> 00:09:35,359
I love robbing the English.

117
00:09:35,394 --> 00:09:37,793
- They're so polite.
- The d-d-d...

118
00:09:37,828 --> 00:09:39,233
- What is it, Ken?
- The dog!

119
00:09:39,268 --> 00:09:40,638
We didn't hit the dog.

120
00:09:40,673 --> 00:09:44,313
- $20 million and an insect worries him!
- It's not an in-in...

121
00:09:44,513 --> 00:09:47,713
Stutter's not getting any better.
How about surgery?

122
00:09:47,873 --> 00:09:48,833
Shut up!

123
00:09:54,593 --> 00:09:55,832
Ken.

124
00:09:57,472 --> 00:09:58,712
Bye!

125
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:30,076
Let's split.

126
00:10:30,111 --> 00:10:33,470
- See you at Heathrow on Tuesday.
- Lie low. No celebrating.

127
00:10:33,505 --> 00:10:35,150
No celebrating?

128
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:38,110
See you in a couple of hours.

129
00:11:24,547 --> 00:11:25,986
To $20 million.

130
00:11:26,021 --> 00:11:27,426
To a job well done.

131
00:11:27,461 --> 00:11:28,351
To us.

132
00:11:28,386 --> 00:11:31,266
To the best
brother and sister team since...

133
00:11:31,301 --> 00:11:32,670
Romeo and Juliet?

134
00:11:32,705 --> 00:11:35,986
Do you believe those Cockney klutzes
bought our story?

135
00:11:36,066 --> 00:11:36,991
What morons!

136
00:11:37,026 --> 00:11:39,390
- I want you to know something.
- What?

137
00:11:39,425 --> 00:11:42,785
Even if you were my brother,
I'd still want to fuck you.

138
00:11:43,265 --> 00:11:44,545
Oooh!

139
00:11:45,666 --> 00:11:47,305
Make the call.

140
00:11:47,585 --> 00:11:49,025
- Momento, carissima.
- No!

141
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:50,465
- Eventuale!
- No Italian!

142
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:51,704
Hey!

143
00:11:51,905 --> 00:11:54,945
Per cominciare,
due insalate verdi con peperoni.

144
00:11:55,264 --> 00:11:57,630
- E linguine primavera...
- No. No.

145
00:11:57,665 --> 00:12:00,784
- Una cotoletta di vitello.
- Make the call, Otto.

146
00:12:01,024 --> 00:12:02,464
Are you really Italian?

147
00:12:02,499 --> 00:12:03,869
Absolutamente. Si!

148
00:12:03,904 --> 00:12:05,824
My name is Otto. It means eight.

149
00:12:05,859 --> 00:12:07,743
Say arrivederci a Giorgio.

150
00:12:07,778 --> 00:12:08,668
Bye, George.

151
00:12:08,703 --> 00:12:10,624
The police, please.

152
00:12:10,659 --> 00:12:11,903
Otto!

153
00:12:13,503 --> 00:12:15,388
Yes, hello.

154
00:12:15,423 --> 00:12:18,268
Sorry to trouble you,
but you may like to know...

155
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:22,383
.. that today's Hatton Garden robbery
was pulled off by Mr George Thomason.

156
00:12:23,583 --> 00:12:26,462
He lives at flat three, Kipling Mansions,...

157
00:12:27,422 --> 00:12:29,503
.. Murray Road, London W9.

158
00:12:31,262 --> 00:12:32,581
Wanda!

159
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:57,221
Police! Open up!

160
00:12:58,141 --> 00:12:59,900
Come on, open up!

161
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:06,500
Open the door, or we'll knock it down!

162
00:13:15,899 --> 00:13:17,939
George Francis Thomason?

163
00:13:29,338 --> 00:13:30,939
Passport,...

164
00:13:31,258 --> 00:13:32,218
.. tickets,...

165
00:13:32,253 --> 00:13:33,618
.. money!

166
00:13:39,418 --> 00:13:40,857
Asshole!

167
00:13:50,457 --> 00:13:52,257
We're rich, Wanda.

168
00:13:52,377 --> 00:13:53,302
Yep?

169
00:13:53,337 --> 00:13:55,221
I bet these weeks with me...

170
00:13:55,256 --> 00:13:58,137
.. have been
the most exciting weeks of your life.

171
00:13:58,172 --> 00:13:59,697
You said it.

172
00:14:11,576 --> 00:14:13,136
OK.

173
00:14:13,496 --> 00:14:14,695
OK.

174
00:14:15,415 --> 00:14:17,015
Disappointed!

175
00:14:18,295 --> 00:14:19,855
Sonofabitch!

176
00:14:20,215 --> 00:14:23,095
What do you have to do
to make people trust you?!

177
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:24,494
Shut up.

178
00:14:24,535 --> 00:14:27,075
People are always
taking advantage of me!

179
00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:29,615
Shut up and think.
Where's he moved it?

180
00:14:32,214 --> 00:14:33,174
What are you doing?

181
00:14:33,209 --> 00:14:34,774
I'm thinking!

182
00:14:35,094 --> 00:14:36,979
Thinking what I'll do to him.

183
00:14:37,014 --> 00:14:39,379
I'll hang him up with piano wire...

184
00:14:39,414 --> 00:14:42,533
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to talk to him.

185
00:14:43,253 --> 00:14:44,693
Talk to who?

186
00:14:44,728 --> 00:14:46,099
Talk to who?!

187
00:14:46,134 --> 00:14:48,773
So, while installing these windows,...

188
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:52,652
.. you knelt on some broken glass
from the pane you had dropped.

189
00:14:52,853 --> 00:14:53,778
That's right, sir.

190
00:14:53,813 --> 00:14:56,092
Your parents can confirm this?

191
00:14:56,212 --> 00:14:57,632
Yes, and his aunt,...

192
00:14:57,667 --> 00:14:59,052
.. Georgina Thomason.

193
00:14:59,093 --> 00:15:00,018
Good, Bartlett.

194
00:15:00,053 --> 00:15:01,972
Yes?

195
00:15:02,007 --> 00:15:03,857
Sorry to interrupt you, sir.

196
00:15:03,892 --> 00:15:06,257
Thomason. A young lady to see you.

197
00:15:06,292 --> 00:15:09,612
- Anything else?
- No, thanks. Do you have to dash off?

198
00:15:09,652 --> 00:15:11,092
No, absolutely not.

199
00:15:11,127 --> 00:15:12,017
George!

200
00:15:12,052 --> 00:15:14,851
Ken's got the fish food. He'll be in later.

201
00:15:14,931 --> 00:15:16,336
- Thanks.
- De nada.

202
00:15:16,371 --> 00:15:17,776
What do you think, Mr Leach?

203
00:15:17,811 --> 00:15:21,491
We may be OK on the glass,
but what else will they come up with?

204
00:15:32,491 --> 00:15:33,895
Oh, George!

205
00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:36,810
Oh, my God, I can't believe
this is happening.

206
00:15:36,845 --> 00:15:39,209
That's not allowed in here, miss.

207
00:15:39,244 --> 00:15:40,427
Are you OK?

208
00:15:40,462 --> 00:15:41,575
It's all right.

209
00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:43,495
I don't think I can handle this.

210
00:15:43,530 --> 00:15:45,930
I was too afraid to sleep last night...

211
00:15:45,965 --> 00:15:48,249
Leave it out, leave it out, OK?

212
00:15:48,809 --> 00:15:50,729
Listen, listen, listen.

213
00:15:50,764 --> 00:15:52,089
Listen.

214
00:15:53,128 --> 00:15:55,128
You stayed at my place.

215
00:15:56,489 --> 00:15:58,129
We slept late.

216
00:15:58,409 --> 00:16:00,368
You made me breakfast.

217
00:16:04,648 --> 00:16:05,928
What?

218
00:16:06,569 --> 00:16:08,488
What's he doing here?

219
00:16:08,523 --> 00:16:10,408
He wanted to see you.

220
00:16:10,888 --> 00:16:13,047
Who did it, George? Kevin Delaney?

221
00:16:13,082 --> 00:16:15,207
Do you want me to rub him out?

222
00:16:15,242 --> 00:16:17,092
Anything, you name it.

223
00:16:17,127 --> 00:16:19,487
I have friends making enquiries.

224
00:16:19,528 --> 00:16:20,807
Good.

225
00:16:21,447 --> 00:16:23,527
The jewels are very safe.

226
00:16:23,847 --> 00:16:27,487
If I get sent down, it all gets
handed back to cut my sentence.

227
00:16:27,686 --> 00:16:30,052
Now, to cut my sentence even more,...

228
00:16:30,087 --> 00:16:32,847
.. I could tell them who done it with me...

229
00:16:32,967 --> 00:16:35,726
.. if I wasn't very happy about everything.

230
00:16:37,286 --> 00:16:39,206
What was the middle thing?

231
00:16:39,241 --> 00:16:40,645
Piss off.

232
00:16:44,846 --> 00:16:47,446
- You want me to spring you...
- Now!

233
00:16:52,045 --> 00:16:53,405
George?

234
00:16:54,925 --> 00:16:56,365
You don't think...

235
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,724
Do you?

236
00:16:58,285 --> 00:16:59,485
No!

237
00:17:02,124 --> 00:17:03,324
No.

238
00:17:04,044 --> 00:17:05,244
No!

239
00:17:05,485 --> 00:17:06,685
OK.

240
00:17:07,404 --> 00:17:09,204
- George.
- What?

241
00:17:10,284 --> 00:17:12,843
Are you sure the garage is very safe?

242
00:17:15,083 --> 00:17:16,523
Trust me.

243
00:17:17,003 --> 00:17:18,883
Thank you very much.

244
00:17:18,924 --> 00:17:20,503
Thanks a lot. Bye.

245
00:17:20,538 --> 00:17:22,083
Have a good day.

246
00:17:22,763 --> 00:17:23,688
So?

247
00:17:23,723 --> 00:17:25,163
He's not sure it was you.

248
00:17:25,198 --> 00:17:26,088
What about you?

249
00:17:26,123 --> 00:17:27,527
No, no, he believes me.

250
00:17:27,562 --> 00:17:29,963
That's why he can't figure out about you.

251
00:17:29,998 --> 00:17:31,368
Figure out what?

252
00:17:31,403 --> 00:17:34,123
Whether you turned him in or not, stupid!

253
00:17:34,762 --> 00:17:36,283
Don't er...

254
00:17:36,682 --> 00:17:38,602
.. ever, ever, ever...

255
00:17:39,562 --> 00:17:41,482
.. call me stupid. OK?

256
00:17:43,882 --> 00:17:45,161
What?

257
00:17:48,201 --> 00:17:50,201
That's George's lawyer.

258
00:17:50,601 --> 00:17:53,121
The other guy must be the barrister.

259
00:17:54,442 --> 00:17:55,641
So?

260
00:17:55,881 --> 00:17:57,321
Trust me.

261
00:18:00,521 --> 00:18:02,881
Let me know
if anything unexpected turns...

262
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:04,286
Excuse me.

263
00:18:04,321 --> 00:18:06,280
Don't I recognise you?

264
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,800
No. No, I don't think so.

265
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,320
Oh.

266
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:13,199
You are a famous barrister, aren't you?

267
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,240
Erm...

268
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,959
Well, hardly.

269
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,799
Could I have your autograph, anyway?

270
00:18:21,599 --> 00:18:23,039
Yes, yes, certainly.

271
00:18:23,074 --> 00:18:23,964
Thanks.

272
00:18:23,999 --> 00:18:26,759
I'm studying aspects of your legal system.

273
00:18:26,879 --> 00:18:27,839
I'm American.

274
00:18:27,874 --> 00:18:28,764
Oh, really?

275
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:31,519
I've only just started. It's fascinating.

276
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:34,039
What er... What brings you here?

277
00:18:34,078 --> 00:18:35,998
Oh, it's a little embarrassing.

278
00:18:36,033 --> 00:18:37,838
I... have a friend.

279
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:39,119
Oh!

280
00:18:39,359 --> 00:18:40,283
I see.

281
00:18:40,318 --> 00:18:41,518
There you are.

282
00:18:41,553 --> 00:18:42,683
I knew it!

283
00:18:42,718 --> 00:18:44,158
You're Archie Leash.

284
00:18:44,193 --> 00:18:45,477
Leach.

285
00:18:45,597 --> 00:18:46,522
Right.

286
00:18:46,557 --> 00:18:48,217
I saw you in court!

287
00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:49,877
Er... two weeks ago.

288
00:18:50,398 --> 00:18:51,838
The casino break-in?

289
00:18:51,873 --> 00:18:53,242
You were great!

290
00:18:53,277 --> 00:18:55,197
Oh, I'm a big fan of yours.

291
00:18:55,232 --> 00:18:57,117
I love the way you er...

292
00:18:57,152 --> 00:18:58,837
.. cross-examine.

293
00:18:59,516 --> 00:19:01,797
Oh, I really admire your work.

294
00:19:02,397 --> 00:19:03,876
Thank you.

295
00:19:05,277 --> 00:19:07,676
- I'd better not...
- I don't suppose...

296
00:19:07,711 --> 00:19:09,397
No? Fine, right.

297
00:19:09,596 --> 00:19:10,521
Well,...

298
00:19:10,556 --> 00:19:12,396
Thank you for this.

299
00:19:12,475 --> 00:19:14,236
I'll treasure it.

300
00:19:15,836 --> 00:19:17,315
Au revoir.

301
00:19:20,155 --> 00:19:22,116
You speak French, too!

302
00:19:41,274 --> 00:19:42,679
What's going on?

303
00:19:42,714 --> 00:19:45,994
Whatever George decides to do,
he'll tell Leach first.

304
00:19:46,553 --> 00:19:47,794
Why?

305
00:19:47,993 --> 00:19:49,434
Because he's his lawyer.

306
00:19:49,469 --> 00:19:50,359
Yeah, I know that.

307
00:19:50,394 --> 00:19:52,759
So I'm going to get to know Mr Leach.

308
00:19:52,794 --> 00:19:55,793
So George will tell him
where the diamonds are?

309
00:19:56,153 --> 00:19:58,593
That's what I'm going to find out.

310
00:20:10,072 --> 00:20:11,957
You done well, my son.

311
00:20:11,992 --> 00:20:14,472
Now, where are we going to hide it?

312
00:20:17,787 --> 00:20:19,157
Very good!

313
00:20:19,192 --> 00:20:21,076
Don't tell Wanda anything.

314
00:20:21,111 --> 00:20:23,511
Otto might get something out of her.

315
00:20:23,546 --> 00:20:24,688
Now...

316
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:25,831
George.

317
00:20:26,392 --> 00:20:27,796
You are going to g-get off?

318
00:20:27,831 --> 00:20:30,191
Sure, don't worry about it, Ken.

319
00:20:30,231 --> 00:20:31,156
We'll fix it.

320
00:20:31,191 --> 00:20:32,631
Now, anything on Otto?

321
00:20:32,666 --> 00:20:34,190
No. Not yet.

322
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:37,150
You watch him.

323
00:20:39,790 --> 00:20:41,030
Ken!

324
00:20:43,150 --> 00:20:44,350
OK.

325
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:47,430
Looks like the police have been all over it.

326
00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:50,469
Let me change clothes,
then I'll help you look.

327
00:20:51,309 --> 00:20:53,229
Hello,...

328
00:20:53,264 --> 00:20:55,150
.. K-K-Ken's p-p-pets.

329
00:20:56,110 --> 00:20:57,349
Hey!

330
00:20:58,029 --> 00:20:59,429
Wake up!

331
00:20:59,949 --> 00:21:01,829
Wake up, limey fish!

332
00:21:03,308 --> 00:21:06,628
So. How are you going to get friendly
with this lawyer?

333
00:21:06,669 --> 00:21:08,908
I don't know. I'll improvise.

334
00:21:09,548 --> 00:21:10,473
Fucking insects!

335
00:21:10,508 --> 00:21:13,948
I thought Englishmen didn't like women,
the way they talk.

336
00:21:14,828 --> 00:21:15,752
No!

337
00:21:15,787 --> 00:21:19,388
He's straight. He's kinda cute, too,
in a pompous sort of way.

338
00:21:20,588 --> 00:21:22,507
Have you got the hots for him?

339
00:21:22,542 --> 00:21:24,427
I'm not into necrophilia, thanks.

340
00:21:26,347 --> 00:21:28,707
What is this? Hump-a-limey week?

341
00:21:28,747 --> 00:21:30,667
Otto doesn't approve.

342
00:21:30,702 --> 00:21:32,552
Otto might get jealous.

343
00:21:32,587 --> 00:21:34,867
E molto pericoloso, signorina.

344
00:21:37,386 --> 00:21:39,227
Molto pericoloso...

345
00:21:45,546 --> 00:21:46,471
Carissima.

346
00:21:46,506 --> 00:21:48,506
Oh, speak it, speak it!

347
00:21:48,906 --> 00:21:51,305
Un ossobuco milanese con piselli.

348
00:21:52,745 --> 00:21:55,146
Melanzane parmigiana con spinaci.

349
00:21:57,545 --> 00:21:59,085
Dov'� la farmacia?

350
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,625
Yes, yes, yes!

351
00:22:00,905 --> 00:22:01,830
No, no, no.

352
00:22:01,865 --> 00:22:03,784
- Si, si, si.
- No, no, no.

353
00:22:03,819 --> 00:22:05,002
No, not here.

354
00:22:05,037 --> 00:22:06,150
Otto, not here.

355
00:22:06,185 --> 00:22:07,625
Dov'� la Fontana di Trevi?

356
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:08,585
Not here, Otto!

357
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:09,905
Erm...

358
00:22:10,025 --> 00:22:10,949
Mozzarella...

359
00:22:10,984 --> 00:22:12,389
Er... Parmigiana...

360
00:22:12,424 --> 00:22:14,544
- Gorgonzola!
- Otto, no!

361
00:22:19,144 --> 00:22:20,464
Wanda!

362
00:22:26,384 --> 00:22:28,503
Look what I've got, Wanda.

363
00:22:30,223 --> 00:22:31,663
Treasure!

364
00:22:58,541 --> 00:22:59,781
Ssh!

365
00:23:14,861 --> 00:23:15,960
Aaagh!

366
00:23:15,995 --> 00:23:17,060
Ooh!

367
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:18,665
Oh, my God, Ken, it's you!

368
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:20,859
I thought it was the police again.

369
00:23:20,894 --> 00:23:22,984
Isn't it horrible about George?

370
00:23:23,019 --> 00:23:26,380
I've such a headache.
Could you go and get me some aspirin?

371
00:23:26,415 --> 00:23:27,785
Shit.

372
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:30,699
- What's that?
- My brother's using the bathroom.

373
00:23:30,734 --> 00:23:33,500
- Otto?
- Mm. We just went and saw George.

374
00:23:33,579 --> 00:23:36,179
It was horrible, Ken, just horrible...

375
00:23:42,698 --> 00:23:43,623
Isn't it terrible about George?

376
00:23:43,658 --> 00:23:46,219
When I find the bastard who squealed!

377
00:23:47,018 --> 00:23:48,738
I love that man!

378
00:23:48,937 --> 00:23:51,138
What are you d-d-doing here?

379
00:23:51,818 --> 00:23:53,223
What am I doing here?

380
00:23:53,258 --> 00:23:56,137
Wanda was upset, Ken.
She needed to talk to family.

381
00:23:56,172 --> 00:23:57,418
Sh...

382
00:23:57,577 --> 00:23:59,857
She's just had a sh-sh-shower.

383
00:24:01,898 --> 00:24:03,817
I've got to speak to you.

384
00:24:05,737 --> 00:24:07,142
Are you OK, now, sis?

385
00:24:07,177 --> 00:24:10,536
- I'm fine, thanks for coming.
- Call me if you need me.

386
00:24:12,936 --> 00:24:15,856
What's up with you?
Can't you think about her feelings?

387
00:24:15,891 --> 00:24:17,776
Something f-f-funny is going on.

388
00:24:17,811 --> 00:24:19,181
Oh dear, oh dear.

389
00:24:19,216 --> 00:24:21,136
You don't know why you're excited.

390
00:24:21,171 --> 00:24:23,021
- I saw the b...
- Ken, Ken, Ken!

391
00:24:23,056 --> 00:24:26,335
I didn't want to say anything
while George was around.

392
00:24:26,895 --> 00:24:28,815
Isn't it time you faced facts?

393
00:24:28,850 --> 00:24:30,215
Come on!

394
00:24:31,215 --> 00:24:33,455
You're a very attractive man.

395
00:24:33,616 --> 00:24:34,540
You're smart.

396
00:24:34,575 --> 00:24:36,460
You've got wonderful bones,...

397
00:24:36,495 --> 00:24:39,255
.. great eyes, and you dress interestingly.

398
00:24:39,375 --> 00:24:40,299
Wh-wh-wh...

399
00:24:40,334 --> 00:24:42,219
We could have a lot of fun together.

400
00:24:42,254 --> 00:24:45,055
I think we'd be really good for each other.

401
00:24:45,134 --> 00:24:46,854
What do you say?

402
00:24:48,014 --> 00:24:49,895
You must be j-j-j...

403
00:24:49,934 --> 00:24:51,134
May I kiss you, Ken?

404
00:24:51,169 --> 00:24:52,711
No, you fucking can't!

405
00:24:52,746 --> 00:24:54,253
Just a peck! No tongue!

406
00:24:54,288 --> 00:24:55,178
No, no!

407
00:24:55,213 --> 00:24:56,934
Ken! Ken!

408
00:25:00,973 --> 00:25:02,213
Ken!

409
00:25:02,413 --> 00:25:04,813
OK. You didn't realise I was gay.

410
00:25:04,848 --> 00:25:06,413
OK, no, look.

411
00:25:06,733 --> 00:25:07,657
I'm sorry.

412
00:25:07,692 --> 00:25:09,578
I've handled this badly.

413
00:25:09,613 --> 00:25:12,013
Look, the physical side can wait.

414
00:25:12,493 --> 00:25:14,133
You need time.

415
00:25:15,852 --> 00:25:17,892
Will you think about it?

416
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:40,891
Oh, my God.

417
00:25:43,210 --> 00:25:44,730
Oh, my God!

418
00:25:45,130 --> 00:25:46,370
Ken!

419
00:25:47,051 --> 00:25:48,455
Somebody just called!

420
00:25:48,490 --> 00:25:50,375
They said that the police...

421
00:25:50,410 --> 00:25:52,810
No, that the loot
is in a garage in Fulham.

422
00:25:52,845 --> 00:25:54,694
You and I have to go get it now.

423
00:25:54,729 --> 00:25:57,129
We have to move it
before the police find it.

424
00:25:57,164 --> 00:25:58,535
No, no, no...

425
00:25:58,570 --> 00:26:00,489
- What?
- It's all right!

426
00:26:00,524 --> 00:26:02,409
- What?
- Ge-Ge-Ge...

427
00:26:02,444 --> 00:26:03,849
George...

428
00:26:04,329 --> 00:26:05,549
M- m-m...

429
00:26:05,584 --> 00:26:06,769
.. moved...

430
00:26:07,209 --> 00:26:09,209
George moved the loot?!

431
00:26:09,609 --> 00:26:10,849
Yes.

432
00:26:11,049 --> 00:26:12,748
Where did he move it, Ken?

433
00:26:12,783 --> 00:26:14,448
Where did he move it?!

434
00:26:14,888 --> 00:26:16,289
C- c-c...

435
00:26:25,928 --> 00:26:29,208
I don't know where it is.
There's a key for something.

436
00:26:29,287 --> 00:26:30,768
It's in...

437
00:26:32,647 --> 00:26:33,573
Don't tell me.

438
00:26:33,608 --> 00:26:36,087
It's better that you don't tell me.

439
00:26:36,967 --> 00:26:39,646
Oh, you know, if it wasn't for George...

440
00:26:45,126 --> 00:26:46,526
Otto...

441
00:26:48,007 --> 00:26:49,846
.. tried to k-k-k...

442
00:26:49,926 --> 00:26:51,406
.. kiss me.

443
00:26:53,286 --> 00:26:55,126
I thought he might.

444
00:26:57,606 --> 00:26:58,806
No.

445
00:26:59,046 --> 00:27:00,931
Nothing, no marks at all.

446
00:27:00,966 --> 00:27:02,850
But it is a safety deposit box key?

447
00:27:02,885 --> 00:27:05,566
Yes, but there are millions of them,...

448
00:27:05,765 --> 00:27:07,685
.. hotels, banks, offices.

449
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:08,922
Sorry.

450
00:27:08,957 --> 00:27:10,125
Thank you.

451
00:27:27,844 --> 00:27:29,248
That's him.

452
00:27:29,283 --> 00:27:31,168
That's him, Inspector.

453
00:27:31,203 --> 00:27:33,964
He's the one
who tried to murder my dogs.

454
00:27:51,482 --> 00:27:52,922
Davidson!

455
00:27:53,402 --> 00:27:56,722
An American legal student
wants to see me for a moment.

456
00:27:56,761 --> 00:27:59,162
- What time is Sir John due?
- 12.30, sir.

457
00:27:59,197 --> 00:28:00,482
Right.

458
00:28:09,721 --> 00:28:11,120
Come in!

459
00:28:12,121 --> 00:28:14,041
- Hi.
- How very nice to see you.

460
00:28:14,076 --> 00:28:15,840
Am I interrupting?

461
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,400
Absolutely not.

462
00:28:17,435 --> 00:28:18,761
Really?

463
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:20,760
Really. Delighted to see you.

464
00:28:20,795 --> 00:28:22,081
Hello.

465
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:25,800
So.

466
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:27,925
This is the place.

467
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:29,844
- This is it.
- Very nice.

468
00:28:29,879 --> 00:28:33,040
I was at the courts this morning.
It's fascinating!

469
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:35,125
Really, so much to know,

470
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:37,259
Everybody wears these. Do you?

471
00:28:37,294 --> 00:28:39,359
Oh, ridiculous!

472
00:28:42,359 --> 00:28:43,283
Well, erm...

473
00:28:43,318 --> 00:28:45,719
.. I only have a few minutes. Sorry.

474
00:28:45,754 --> 00:28:46,644
I'm sorry.

475
00:28:46,679 --> 00:28:49,079
But until then,
I'm all yours, as they say.

476
00:28:49,114 --> 00:28:51,518
I just have a couple of questions.

477
00:28:52,438 --> 00:28:54,323
I'm having a little problem...

478
00:28:54,358 --> 00:28:57,398
.. understanding
preliminary criminal procedures.

479
00:28:58,198 --> 00:29:00,478
What exactly is the committal?

480
00:29:01,078 --> 00:29:02,003
Ah. Interesting.

481
00:29:02,038 --> 00:29:04,998
Basically,
it's a preliminary investigation...

482
00:29:05,397 --> 00:29:07,797
.. where the prosecution
presents evidence...

483
00:29:07,832 --> 00:29:10,198
.. that the accused has a case to answer.

484
00:29:10,233 --> 00:29:12,082
That's what it says in the book.

485
00:29:12,117 --> 00:29:15,276
Let's take, for example,
my friend George Thomason.

486
00:29:15,477 --> 00:29:16,796
Right.

487
00:29:16,916 --> 00:29:19,796
- His committal is on Wednesday...
- Thomason?

488
00:29:19,831 --> 00:29:21,037
Yes.

489
00:29:21,237 --> 00:29:22,956
George Thomason?

490
00:29:23,157 --> 00:29:25,076
Yes. Do you know him?

491
00:29:26,516 --> 00:29:27,921
I'm defending him.

492
00:29:27,956 --> 00:29:30,055
What are you talking about?

493
00:29:30,090 --> 00:29:32,155
I'm his barrister, his lawyer.

494
00:29:33,236 --> 00:29:34,955
That's so great!

495
00:29:36,116 --> 00:29:38,615
That's so weird, isn't that weird?

496
00:29:38,650 --> 00:29:41,115
Oh, I'm so happy you're defending him!

497
00:29:41,875 --> 00:29:42,800
Thank you.

498
00:29:42,835 --> 00:29:44,915
He's sure to get off now.

499
00:29:45,715 --> 00:29:46,955
Wow!

500
00:29:47,635 --> 00:29:49,555
I can watch you work now!

501
00:29:49,590 --> 00:29:50,914
Please.

502
00:29:53,394 --> 00:29:54,319
Amazing.

503
00:29:54,354 --> 00:29:55,279
Well, anyway.

504
00:29:55,314 --> 00:29:58,194
At the committal,
George would then plead...

505
00:29:58,674 --> 00:30:00,073
Not guilty.

506
00:30:00,108 --> 00:30:01,473
Really?

507
00:30:01,554 --> 00:30:04,193
The evidence is largely circumstantial.

508
00:30:04,433 --> 00:30:06,833
But wasn't there an identification?

509
00:30:06,868 --> 00:30:09,030
True, but a very elderly lady.

510
00:30:09,065 --> 00:30:11,193
I think they've got the wrong man.

511
00:30:12,593 --> 00:30:14,513
You don't think he did it?

512
00:30:14,548 --> 00:30:15,438
No.

513
00:30:15,473 --> 00:30:17,872
Let's just say, for argument's sake,...

514
00:30:17,907 --> 00:30:19,757
.. that you did think he did it.

515
00:30:19,792 --> 00:30:22,872
Sure, if more evidence
against him came to light.

516
00:30:23,153 --> 00:30:24,077
Right, right.

517
00:30:24,112 --> 00:30:27,072
You would then advise him
to plead guilty,...

518
00:30:27,472 --> 00:30:30,632
.. and turn over the jewels
to get his sentence cut.

519
00:30:31,311 --> 00:30:34,151
And he would turn them over
to who, to you?

520
00:30:36,112 --> 00:30:37,551
Theoretically, yes, yes.

521
00:30:37,586 --> 00:30:38,888
Oh, of course.

522
00:30:38,923 --> 00:30:40,191
Erm. Well er...

523
00:30:41,391 --> 00:30:44,030
I'm so sorry, I've forgotten your name.

524
00:30:46,191 --> 00:30:47,116
Wanda.

525
00:30:47,151 --> 00:30:49,511
Wanda! What a fool, what a fool.

526
00:30:49,551 --> 00:30:51,870
Well, Wanda, there are three...

527
00:30:56,270 --> 00:30:57,711
Not Wanda Gershwitz?

528
00:30:57,746 --> 00:30:58,950
Yes.

529
00:30:59,630 --> 00:31:01,150
Oh, my God.

530
00:31:01,550 --> 00:31:02,830
What?

531
00:31:02,990 --> 00:31:04,410
You're his alibi.

532
00:31:04,445 --> 00:31:05,830
I can't talk to you!

533
00:31:06,349 --> 00:31:07,274
Why not?

534
00:31:07,309 --> 00:31:09,709
My dear lady, you're a defence witness!

535
00:31:09,744 --> 00:31:12,109
I'm sorry, I must ask you to leave.

536
00:31:12,144 --> 00:31:13,514
What did I say?

537
00:31:13,549 --> 00:31:16,429
It's not ethical for me
to talk to a witness.

538
00:31:16,464 --> 00:31:18,366
Everybody does it in America.

539
00:31:18,401 --> 00:31:20,233
Not in England, it's forbidden.

540
00:31:20,268 --> 00:31:22,669
I insist, or I may have
to give up the case.

541
00:31:22,704 --> 00:31:24,469
I'm sorry. Please.

542
00:31:28,908 --> 00:31:30,428
Oh, Archie.

543
00:31:32,747 --> 00:31:36,267
I didn't come here to talk about
boring criminal procedures.

544
00:31:38,507 --> 00:31:40,307
Come on, you know!

545
00:31:41,867 --> 00:31:44,427
You knew the minute I walked in here.

546
00:31:46,187 --> 00:31:47,706
I want you.

547
00:31:50,507 --> 00:31:51,787
What?

548
00:31:53,866 --> 00:31:55,306
- Hello?
- Sir John is here.

549
00:31:55,341 --> 00:31:56,943
Show him in, please.

550
00:31:56,978 --> 00:31:58,546
Make love with me.

551
00:31:58,666 --> 00:32:00,071
- Pardon?
- Nothing.

552
00:32:00,106 --> 00:32:02,785
- Will you take me to bed?
- No, sorry.

553
00:32:05,385 --> 00:32:06,906
Bye, Uncle.

554
00:32:11,146 --> 00:32:12,345
Hi!

555
00:32:29,384 --> 00:32:31,268
He's pleading not guilty...

556
00:32:31,303 --> 00:32:33,704
.. so you're safe until the trial.

557
00:32:34,184 --> 00:32:36,464
Leach doesn't think he did it.

558
00:32:38,024 --> 00:32:40,903
Ken says
there's a safe deposit box key,...

559
00:32:40,938 --> 00:32:43,423
.. but only George knows where it is.

560
00:32:43,783 --> 00:32:45,623
Thank you, Wanda

561
00:32:48,583 --> 00:32:50,503
What have you found out?

562
00:32:50,538 --> 00:32:51,907
Not a lot.

563
00:32:51,942 --> 00:32:54,342
You realise he's in court tomorrow?

564
00:32:54,377 --> 00:32:55,800
I know that!

565
00:32:55,835 --> 00:32:57,223
So nothing, huh?

566
00:32:57,258 --> 00:32:58,462
Nix.

567
00:32:59,142 --> 00:33:00,382
Zip.

568
00:33:00,582 --> 00:33:01,942
Diddly.

569
00:33:02,022 --> 00:33:03,422
Bupkiss.

570
00:33:05,381 --> 00:33:06,742
Niente.

571
00:33:11,142 --> 00:33:12,546
Oh, it's too big!

572
00:33:12,581 --> 00:33:14,981
- No, it isn't, Portia.
- It's enormous!

573
00:33:15,016 --> 00:33:17,381
- No, it isn't!
- Oh, please, Mother!

574
00:33:17,416 --> 00:33:18,785
No! Absolutely not!

575
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:21,581
I'm so miserable
and you just don't care!

576
00:33:21,701 --> 00:33:23,540
Do shut up, Portia!

577
00:33:24,101 --> 00:33:26,980
All I get, all day,
is people complaining to me.

578
00:33:27,015 --> 00:33:28,380
Oh dear.

579
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:38,260
Ecco I'uomo.

580
00:33:53,978 --> 00:33:57,219
Ooh, le due cupole grandi
della cattedrale di Milano.

581
00:34:41,495 --> 00:34:43,255
Benito Mussolini!

582
00:34:55,894 --> 00:34:57,695
Dov'� il Vaticano?

583
00:35:11,734 --> 00:35:13,134
# Volare

584
00:35:14,133 --> 00:35:15,493
# Oh-oh

585
00:35:15,573 --> 00:35:17,093
# E cantare

586
00:35:17,973 --> 00:35:19,453
# Oh-oh...

587
00:35:29,492 --> 00:35:32,892
Archie, I want you to speak to her
about plastic surgery.

588
00:35:33,813 --> 00:35:36,452
- Hmm?
- I do wish you'd listen to me.

589
00:35:36,692 --> 00:35:38,851
I want you to speak to Portia.

590
00:35:38,886 --> 00:35:41,011
I'll speak to her in the morning.

591
00:35:41,046 --> 00:35:42,811
Goodnight, Archie.

592
00:35:43,411 --> 00:35:45,212
Goodnight, Archie!

593
00:35:45,332 --> 00:35:47,091
Goodnight, Wanda.

594
00:35:47,731 --> 00:35:49,411
Goodnight, who?

595
00:35:50,131 --> 00:35:53,451
Sorry, darling.
Just a stupid case I've got tomorrow...

596
00:35:53,970 --> 00:35:55,855
.. with some lousy old hag.

597
00:35:55,890 --> 00:35:58,330
Are you George Francis Thomason...

598
00:35:59,251 --> 00:36:01,650
.. of Kipling Mansions, Murray Avenue,...

599
00:36:01,685 --> 00:36:03,210
.. London W9?

600
00:36:04,530 --> 00:36:05,455
Yes, sir.

601
00:36:05,490 --> 00:36:07,970
The charge is one of armed robbery.

602
00:36:08,849 --> 00:36:10,770
Are we ready for a committal,
Mr Percival?

603
00:36:10,805 --> 00:36:13,050
Yes, under Section 6.2, madam.

604
00:36:14,609 --> 00:36:16,014
That is correct, 6.2.

605
00:36:16,049 --> 00:36:19,369
Here are the statements,
all to be fully bound, please.

606
00:36:20,488 --> 00:36:22,374
Stand up, Mr Thomason.

607
00:36:22,409 --> 00:36:24,789
You are committed to stand trial...

608
00:36:24,824 --> 00:36:27,169
.. at the Central Criminal Court.

609
00:36:27,688 --> 00:36:30,088
There is some urgency about this case.

610
00:36:30,123 --> 00:36:31,493
The main witness, Mrs Coady,...

611
00:36:31,528 --> 00:36:35,088
.. is elderly and has had
serious heart difficulties recently.

612
00:36:35,848 --> 00:36:38,647
Is there any possibility
that this case...

613
00:36:39,208 --> 00:36:41,607
.. might be put down for an early trial?

614
00:36:41,642 --> 00:36:44,224
That is for the Old Bailey listing officer.

615
00:36:44,259 --> 00:36:46,807
Take him down to the cell, please, officer.

616
00:37:05,606 --> 00:37:07,490
Hi, hon. How are you doing?

617
00:37:07,525 --> 00:37:09,926
You look great. I love your hair.

618
00:37:09,961 --> 00:37:10,851
Got time for a coffee?

619
00:37:10,886 --> 00:37:13,286
- No, I've g-g...
- Have you thought about it?

620
00:37:13,321 --> 00:37:15,170
Why did he give you this?

621
00:37:15,205 --> 00:37:17,090
Eileen Coady, 69 Basil Street.

622
00:37:17,125 --> 00:37:19,685
Does he want you to send her flowers?

623
00:37:20,005 --> 00:37:20,929
Do her shopping?

624
00:37:20,964 --> 00:37:22,405
Show her a good time?

625
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:23,965
Rub her out?

626
00:37:27,205 --> 00:37:29,405
He wants you to rub her out?

627
00:37:31,044 --> 00:37:32,484
He's going to kill her!

628
00:37:35,364 --> 00:37:37,524
Fuck off, or I'll kill you.

629
00:37:38,244 --> 00:37:39,843
Limey fruits!

630
00:37:41,124 --> 00:37:44,003
So the old lady will
m- meet with an accident?

631
00:37:44,038 --> 00:37:46,243
- Eh, K-K-Ken?
- Sssh. Sssh!

632
00:37:48,324 --> 00:37:49,728
What's so funny?

633
00:37:49,763 --> 00:37:52,843
Nothing.
Just that wasting old ladies isn't nice.

634
00:37:53,123 --> 00:37:55,882
Well, it's better than b-buggering people.

635
00:37:56,962 --> 00:37:59,522
I bet you pound 1 you don't kill her.

636
00:38:00,803 --> 00:38:03,242
All right.

637
00:38:03,682 --> 00:38:06,082
I love watching your ass when you walk.

638
00:38:06,117 --> 00:38:08,202
Is that beautiful or what?

639
00:38:08,961 --> 00:38:10,762
Don't go near him!

640
00:38:10,882 --> 00:38:12,362
He's mine!

641
00:38:13,282 --> 00:38:15,201
pound 1 says you won't kill her!

642
00:38:18,561 --> 00:38:19,966
When could you look at it?

643
00:38:20,001 --> 00:38:23,201
Let's think.
My wife's going to the opera on Friday.

644
00:38:23,361 --> 00:38:26,241
I'll look at it then
and call you on Saturday.

645
00:38:26,276 --> 00:38:28,961
- I really appreciate it. Thanks.
- Bye.

646
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:30,045
Hi.

647
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:32,480
I know we're not allowed to talk.

648
00:38:32,515 --> 00:38:33,921
Give me a call.

649
00:38:33,956 --> 00:38:35,320
I can't.

650
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:37,245
Please?

651
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:39,440
We're not allowed to speak.

652
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:41,440
We don't have to.

653
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:44,719
I don't want you for your conversation.

654
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:50,440
I'd love to...

655
00:39:01,759 --> 00:39:04,398
- What happened?
- Got a date, Friday.

656
00:39:20,117 --> 00:39:21,523
Look here!

657
00:39:21,558 --> 00:39:24,396
Do you mind
not making that terrible noise?

658
00:39:24,437 --> 00:39:26,357
My dogs will be having their nap.

659
00:39:26,392 --> 00:39:27,877
Nice doggy.

660
00:39:28,757 --> 00:39:30,217
Nice... doggy.

661
00:39:46,996 --> 00:39:48,881
Otto, what are you doing?

662
00:39:48,916 --> 00:39:51,315
It's a Buddhist meditation technique.

663
00:39:51,350 --> 00:39:53,200
It focuses your aggression.

664
00:39:53,235 --> 00:39:56,114
The monks did it
before they went into battle.

665
00:39:56,149 --> 00:39:58,395
What kind of Buddhism is this?

666
00:40:03,090 --> 00:40:04,235
Asshole!

667
00:40:05,234 --> 00:40:07,634
It's an early Tantric meditation...

668
00:40:07,669 --> 00:40:09,040
What is this?

669
00:40:09,075 --> 00:40:12,513
To get information,
I might have to get friendly with him.

670
00:40:12,914 --> 00:40:15,233
Well, we're ready now, at last.

671
00:40:15,794 --> 00:40:17,678
Good. Enjoy the opera, darling.

672
00:40:17,713 --> 00:40:20,593
- Your supper's in the fridge.
- Marvellous.

673
00:40:20,628 --> 00:40:21,993
Be good.

674
00:40:22,514 --> 00:40:25,793
When you say friendly,
what are we talking about here?

675
00:40:25,873 --> 00:40:27,712
Cordial? Courteous?

676
00:40:27,913 --> 00:40:29,318
Supportive? What?

677
00:40:29,353 --> 00:40:32,153
I don't know.
Let's just see what happens.

678
00:40:33,193 --> 00:40:35,833
So, friendly might include actual er...

679
00:40:36,553 --> 00:40:37,957
.. what, penetration?

680
00:40:37,992 --> 00:40:39,912
I don't need your jealousy now.

681
00:40:39,947 --> 00:40:41,317
- Jealousy?
- Yes.

682
00:40:41,352 --> 00:40:44,432
Hey, I'm merely curious.
Me? Jealous of that fop?

683
00:40:52,871 --> 00:40:54,712
What about my tits?

684
00:40:54,791 --> 00:40:56,195
Does he get to handle them?

685
00:40:56,230 --> 00:40:59,111
Yes. That's my forecast.
I'll stand by that.

686
00:40:59,146 --> 00:41:00,516
Nuzzling?

687
00:41:00,551 --> 00:41:02,951
I think $20 million is worth a nuzzle.

688
00:41:02,986 --> 00:41:03,875
80% chance there.

689
00:41:03,910 --> 00:41:06,750
- Sucking?
- I thought you weren't jealous.

690
00:41:06,790 --> 00:41:10,151
I'm not, I don't believe in jealousy,
it's for the weak.

691
00:41:10,186 --> 00:41:11,555
One thing, though.

692
00:41:11,590 --> 00:41:13,870
Touch his dick, and he's dead!

693
00:41:18,789 --> 00:41:21,629
I told your father
to get the car serviced.

694
00:41:21,670 --> 00:41:23,390
Aren't we going, then?

695
00:41:23,425 --> 00:41:25,110
Oh, do shut up, Portia.

696
00:41:53,947 --> 00:41:55,147
Hi.

697
00:41:56,826 --> 00:41:58,627
Do you despise me?

698
00:42:03,067 --> 00:42:05,787
No, that's not a word that leaps to mind.

699
00:42:06,426 --> 00:42:08,186
Can I stay, then?

700
00:42:13,146 --> 00:42:15,026
Of course. Look,...

701
00:42:16,026 --> 00:42:17,465
- Wanda...
- I know.

702
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:18,870
Your wife's coming back.

703
00:42:18,905 --> 00:42:21,065
No, it's not her. She'll be hours.

704
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:23,122
It's about what I said to you.

705
00:42:23,157 --> 00:42:25,145
It is all right for us to speak.

706
00:42:25,180 --> 00:42:26,070
It is?

707
00:42:26,105 --> 00:42:28,784
Provided that we don't discuss the case.

708
00:42:29,465 --> 00:42:30,664
Oh.

709
00:42:31,384 --> 00:42:32,309
Oh, fine.

710
00:42:32,344 --> 00:42:34,745
It's just, if anyone saw us talking...

711
00:42:34,780 --> 00:42:36,584
Oh, but they won't.

712
00:42:43,864 --> 00:42:45,664
Sorry if I seem...

713
00:42:45,784 --> 00:42:47,189
.. pompous.

714
00:42:47,224 --> 00:42:49,423
Oh, you're the best, Archie.

715
00:42:53,463 --> 00:42:54,663
No.

716
00:42:54,903 --> 00:42:56,303
Not yet.

717
00:42:56,343 --> 00:42:57,904
I'm thirsty.

718
00:43:00,663 --> 00:43:02,583
What shall I get you?

719
00:43:04,023 --> 00:43:05,383
Whisky.

720
00:43:09,783 --> 00:43:12,622
You are the sexiest,
most beautiful girl...

721
00:43:13,142 --> 00:43:15,062
.. I have ever seen...

722
00:43:16,022 --> 00:43:17,902
.. in my entire life.

723
00:43:20,341 --> 00:43:22,062
Get me my drink.

724
00:43:43,455 --> 00:43:44,900
Oh, Archie.

725
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:49,220
Mm, Archie.

726
00:43:54,419 --> 00:43:55,619
So.

727
00:43:56,339 --> 00:43:59,059
If George decides to change his plea,...

728
00:43:59,219 --> 00:44:02,459
.. he'd tell you
where the loot is first, wouldn't he?

729
00:44:02,579 --> 00:44:03,779
Mm?

730
00:44:04,499 --> 00:44:07,378
Darling, we mustn't talk
about the trial, OK?

731
00:44:07,413 --> 00:44:09,858
I know. I just meant theoretically.

732
00:44:10,739 --> 00:44:12,378
Kiss me there.

733
00:44:13,618 --> 00:44:15,058
Oh. Theoretically.

734
00:44:15,093 --> 00:44:16,297
Erm.

735
00:44:21,778 --> 00:44:24,617
.. to his legal representative...

736
00:44:33,297 --> 00:44:34,702
What's the matter?

737
00:44:34,737 --> 00:44:36,657
Oh, it's wonderful, Archie.

738
00:44:36,692 --> 00:44:37,896
Ooh!

739
00:44:40,016 --> 00:44:40,941
Aah!

740
00:44:40,976 --> 00:44:42,381
What? What, darling?

741
00:44:42,416 --> 00:44:44,816
- You're getting me hot!
- Sorry.

742
00:44:44,851 --> 00:44:46,256
I need something to drink.

743
00:44:46,291 --> 00:44:47,661
Something cold?

744
00:44:47,696 --> 00:44:49,136
Maybe in the fridge?

745
00:44:49,171 --> 00:44:50,061
Champagne?

746
00:44:50,096 --> 00:44:51,856
Oh, my favourite.

747
00:44:52,975 --> 00:44:54,616
Don't go away.

748
00:44:57,296 --> 00:44:58,815
Je reviens!

749
00:45:08,814 --> 00:45:10,220
What are you doing here?

750
00:45:10,255 --> 00:45:12,620
- Relax!
- Get the fuck out of here!

751
00:45:12,655 --> 00:45:15,894
- Your moaning worried me.
- I was faking it, stupid!

752
00:45:16,014 --> 00:45:17,419
Don't ever call me stupid.

753
00:45:17,454 --> 00:45:19,853
- And I'm not jealous.
- Then leave!

754
00:45:19,888 --> 00:45:21,054
OK!

755
00:45:21,294 --> 00:45:23,094
It's a nice place.

756
00:45:24,654 --> 00:45:26,573
Don't touch his dick!

757
00:45:28,013 --> 00:45:29,854
His wife, his wife!

758
00:45:32,812 --> 00:45:35,253
For goodness sake, get off to bed.

759
00:45:39,532 --> 00:45:41,613
God, there isn't any ice.

760
00:45:50,572 --> 00:45:52,051
Champagne!

761
00:45:52,492 --> 00:45:53,811
Aaagh!

762
00:45:53,931 --> 00:45:55,731
What's the matter?

763
00:45:56,811 --> 00:45:58,651
What are you doing?

764
00:46:00,171 --> 00:46:02,571
Champagne, dear. To welcome you home.

765
00:46:02,606 --> 00:46:04,890
Erm... let me pour you a glass.

766
00:46:05,931 --> 00:46:07,370
Whose is the car?

767
00:46:07,405 --> 00:46:08,770
The car?

768
00:46:08,810 --> 00:46:10,651
Blocking the drive?

769
00:46:10,731 --> 00:46:12,171
There you are, dear. Cheers.

770
00:46:12,206 --> 00:46:13,628
Nice to see you again.

771
00:46:13,663 --> 00:46:15,015
How was the opera?

772
00:46:15,050 --> 00:46:17,930
- Finished early, did it?
- Whose car is it?

773
00:46:17,965 --> 00:46:19,210
Mine.

774
00:46:19,370 --> 00:46:20,774
It's a beauty, isn't it?

775
00:46:20,809 --> 00:46:23,289
Where did I leave my drink, Archie?

776
00:46:24,170 --> 00:46:25,730
Who is this?

777
00:46:26,090 --> 00:46:27,494
Don't you know?

778
00:46:27,529 --> 00:46:28,934
How do you do, Mrs Leach?

779
00:46:28,969 --> 00:46:31,489
I'm Harvey Manfren... jensen... jen.

780
00:46:32,808 --> 00:46:34,729
- I'm... with the CIA.
- The CIA?

781
00:46:34,764 --> 00:46:36,134
That's correct, ma'am.

782
00:46:36,169 --> 00:46:38,889
I was er...
just telling your husband...

783
00:46:39,529 --> 00:46:42,569
.. before I had to go
to your beautiful bathroom.

784
00:46:42,888 --> 00:46:46,568
We've got a high-ranking KGB defector
in a safe house near here.

785
00:46:47,209 --> 00:46:49,608
We're debriefing him as of now...

786
00:46:49,643 --> 00:46:50,533
.. and we're just er...

787
00:46:50,568 --> 00:46:53,168
.. checking all the houses in the area.

788
00:46:53,447 --> 00:46:55,332
- For what?
- For KGB.

789
00:46:55,367 --> 00:46:57,768
- Is there any danger?
- No, no, no, no.

790
00:46:57,803 --> 00:46:59,688
No er... No, not now.

791
00:47:00,168 --> 00:47:01,568
We er...

792
00:47:01,607 --> 00:47:04,247
We just want to keep everyone informed.

793
00:47:04,487 --> 00:47:06,406
So. Archie, thanks for the drink.

794
00:47:06,441 --> 00:47:08,326
Sorry to have troubled you...

795
00:47:08,361 --> 00:47:10,024
Keep everyone informed?

796
00:47:10,059 --> 00:47:11,687
So there's no panic, ma'am.

797
00:47:11,722 --> 00:47:13,384
But isn't it a secret?

798
00:47:13,419 --> 00:47:15,011
You've no idea how secret.

799
00:47:15,046 --> 00:47:17,526
Well, why are you telling everyone?

800
00:47:17,926 --> 00:47:19,806
It's a smoke screen?

801
00:47:19,846 --> 00:47:21,167
What?!

802
00:47:21,286 --> 00:47:22,211
Double bluff.

803
00:47:22,246 --> 00:47:25,405
You obviously know nothing
about intelligence work.

804
00:47:26,086 --> 00:47:28,285
It's an XK Red 27 technique.

805
00:47:28,485 --> 00:47:31,965
My father was in the Secret Service,
Mr Manfredjen St John.

806
00:47:32,325 --> 00:47:35,805
I know perfectly well
you don't keep the public informed...

807
00:47:36,165 --> 00:47:38,844
.. when you are debriefing KGB defectors.

808
00:47:39,045 --> 00:47:39,970
Oh, you don't, huh

809
00:47:40,005 --> 00:47:43,204
Not unless you're
congenitally insane or stupid, no.

810
00:47:44,804 --> 00:47:46,725
Don't call me stupid.

811
00:47:47,205 --> 00:47:48,965
Why on earth not?

812
00:47:49,604 --> 00:47:52,484
Oh, you English are so superior,
aren't you?

813
00:47:54,403 --> 00:47:56,288
Do you know where you'd be...

814
00:47:56,323 --> 00:47:58,724
.. without us,
the old US of A to protect you?

815
00:47:58,759 --> 00:47:59,649
I'll tell you.

816
00:47:59,684 --> 00:48:03,403
The smallest fucking province
in the Russian Empire, that's what!

817
00:48:04,003 --> 00:48:06,283
So don't call me stupid, lady.

818
00:48:06,403 --> 00:48:07,327
Just thank me.

819
00:48:07,362 --> 00:48:10,002
Thank you for popping in
and protecting us

820
00:48:10,037 --> 00:48:12,643
If it wasn't for us,
you'd be speaking German!

821
00:48:12,678 --> 00:48:14,083
# Deutschland, Deutschland

822
00:48:14,118 --> 00:48:15,642
# �ber alles

823
00:48:16,482 --> 00:48:19,842
He's covering for me.
Get rid of your wife and get my necklace.

824
00:48:19,877 --> 00:48:22,207
Necklace. I'll think of something.

825
00:48:22,242 --> 00:48:24,607
- Who are you talking to?
- Myself, darling.

826
00:48:24,642 --> 00:48:28,121
- Who was that shouting?
- Th-th-the brother of a f-friend.

827
00:48:28,481 --> 00:48:30,401
Archie, who on earth...

828
00:48:30,436 --> 00:48:31,326
I don't know. He...

829
00:48:31,361 --> 00:48:33,762
- I need a drink.
- Let's go to the pub.

830
00:48:33,797 --> 00:48:35,081
What?!

831
00:48:35,201 --> 00:48:36,606
Let's go to the pub.

832
00:48:36,641 --> 00:48:38,081
Would you like to, Portia?

833
00:48:38,116 --> 00:48:39,521
We haven't been for 15 years!

834
00:48:39,556 --> 00:48:41,440
Portia could see it now.

835
00:48:41,475 --> 00:48:42,400
Honestly, Archie!

836
00:48:42,435 --> 00:48:43,325
Aaagh!

837
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:45,246
What on earth is the matter?

838
00:48:45,281 --> 00:48:47,160
I thought the picture was falling off.

839
00:48:47,195 --> 00:48:49,081
Will you pull yourself together?!

840
00:48:49,116 --> 00:48:50,486
What's this?

841
00:48:50,521 --> 00:48:52,840
Thanks, Portia. Coming with us?

842
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:53,845
What was that?

843
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:55,800
- A kind of necklace.
- Aah!

844
00:48:55,835 --> 00:48:57,197
What's going on?

845
00:48:57,232 --> 00:48:58,559
Nothing. Let's go.

846
00:48:58,679 --> 00:48:59,604
Can I see that?

847
00:48:59,639 --> 00:49:01,680
- What?
- In your hand.

848
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:03,480
Your other hand.

849
00:49:04,439 --> 00:49:05,879
Portia, go to your room.

850
00:49:05,914 --> 00:49:07,336
Aren't we going out?

851
00:49:07,371 --> 00:49:08,759
I can explain. I left...

852
00:49:08,794 --> 00:49:09,684
Now!

853
00:49:09,719 --> 00:49:12,118
- They sent a new girl...
- Oh, Archie.

854
00:49:12,153 --> 00:49:14,095
No, she's Canadian...

855
00:49:14,130 --> 00:49:16,038
It's lovely. Thank you.

856
00:49:19,318 --> 00:49:21,519
It's even got a W for Wendy.

857
00:49:21,718 --> 00:49:23,918
Oh, I'm so glad you like it.

858
00:49:25,078 --> 00:49:28,238
It's the most beautiful thing
you've ever given me.

859
00:49:32,757 --> 00:49:35,117
Oh, Archie. This isn't like you.

860
00:49:42,837 --> 00:49:44,837
Are you fucking crazy?!

861
00:49:46,676 --> 00:49:48,081
Hey, I saved your ass.

862
00:49:48,116 --> 00:49:50,997
I had him right where I wanted him,
you asshole!

863
00:49:51,032 --> 00:49:53,553
I give you
one fucking thing to!

864
00:49:53,588 --> 00:49:56,075
You had to drive me and shut up!

865
00:49:56,276 --> 00:49:57,595
Oh, relax!

866
00:50:05,395 --> 00:50:06,715
Hello.

867
00:50:07,795 --> 00:50:09,195
Hold on.

868
00:50:09,235 --> 00:50:10,835
It's for you.

869
00:50:12,114 --> 00:50:13,435
Hello.

870
00:50:15,955 --> 00:50:17,914
Not at the moment, no.

871
00:50:20,754 --> 00:50:24,194
Yes, well, I'm not quite sure
when I can get hold of that.

872
00:50:26,034 --> 00:50:27,954
Yes, yes, I do appreciate that.

873
00:50:27,989 --> 00:50:30,033
Yes. As soon as possible.

874
00:50:31,313 --> 00:50:34,033
Well, that would be very nice, obviously.

875
00:50:34,673 --> 00:50:36,078
So. Erm...

876
00:50:36,113 --> 00:50:37,554
See you soon, I hope.

877
00:50:37,589 --> 00:50:39,073
Bye, Frank.

878
00:50:42,953 --> 00:50:44,837
Calm down. Calm down!

879
00:50:44,872 --> 00:50:47,032
Easy, g-g-girl. Easy, easy!

880
00:50:53,992 --> 00:50:55,512
Come here!

881
00:50:55,547 --> 00:50:57,032
Smell. Smell!

882
00:50:57,352 --> 00:50:59,271
Smell, Maggie, smell.

883
00:51:01,192 --> 00:51:02,711
Kill, kill!

884
00:51:04,072 --> 00:51:05,352
Kill!

885
00:51:05,511 --> 00:51:07,032
Kill!

886
00:51:07,431 --> 00:51:08,951
Kill!

887
00:51:31,430 --> 00:51:34,269
We therefore
commit its body to the ground.

888
00:51:34,789 --> 00:51:36,349
Earth to earth.

889
00:51:36,384 --> 00:51:37,910
Ashes to ashes.

890
00:51:38,150 --> 00:51:39,749
Dust to dust.

891
00:51:41,989 --> 00:51:43,789
# Miserere Dominus

892
00:51:45,348 --> 00:51:47,148
# Miserere Dominus

893
00:51:51,109 --> 00:51:53,068
# Canis mortuus est...

894
00:51:56,828 --> 00:51:58,268
Hello, honey.

895
00:51:58,303 --> 00:51:59,785
What happened?

896
00:51:59,820 --> 00:52:01,267
N- n-nothing.

897
00:52:01,627 --> 00:52:03,067
What's that?

898
00:52:03,102 --> 00:52:03,992
Er...

899
00:52:04,027 --> 00:52:05,227
Not Granny?

900
00:52:05,262 --> 00:52:06,393
Not yet.

901
00:52:06,428 --> 00:52:08,467
Oh. Who is it for, then?

902
00:52:08,827 --> 00:52:09,752
A f-f-f...

903
00:52:09,787 --> 00:52:11,587
A fish? Frenchman?

904
00:52:12,187 --> 00:52:14,106
- A phone operator?
- Friend.

905
00:52:14,141 --> 00:52:16,026
Oh, a four-legged one?

906
00:52:16,061 --> 00:52:17,484
Where's my sister?

907
00:52:17,519 --> 00:52:18,907
She's in the b-b-b...

908
00:52:18,942 --> 00:52:20,124
Thank you.

909
00:52:20,159 --> 00:52:21,392
Lavatory.

910
00:52:21,427 --> 00:52:22,626
Wanda!

911
00:52:24,186 --> 00:52:25,626
Anything?

912
00:52:25,661 --> 00:52:27,031
What? No?

913
00:52:27,066 --> 00:52:28,986
Why are you here?

914
00:52:29,021 --> 00:52:30,871
I'm here because I'm bored!

915
00:52:30,906 --> 00:52:34,586
Bored, wandering around
this awful city, shoving George's pic...

916
00:52:36,185 --> 00:52:40,425
Talking to a lot of snotty, stuck-up,
intellectually inferior British faggots.

917
00:52:41,946 --> 00:52:45,425
They get rigor mortis
in the prime of life in this country!

918
00:52:45,785 --> 00:52:48,544
Standing there with their hair clenched...

919
00:52:50,104 --> 00:52:52,924
.. counting the seconds
till the weekend,...

920
00:52:52,959 --> 00:52:55,744
.. so they can dress up
like ballerinas...

921
00:52:56,344 --> 00:52:58,264
.. at the flat at four...

922
00:52:58,299 --> 00:52:59,824
2B, Saint...

923
00:53:00,664 --> 00:53:03,024
To be honest, I er... hate them.

924
00:53:04,503 --> 00:53:07,504
I mean, pretending
they're so fucking lawyer...

925
00:53:08,823 --> 00:53:11,783
So fucking superior
with those phoney accents.

926
00:53:12,663 --> 00:53:15,062
Not you, Ken.
You've got a beautiful voice...

927
00:53:15,097 --> 00:53:16,783
.. when it works.

928
00:53:17,463 --> 00:53:19,023
Sonofabitch!

929
00:53:24,182 --> 00:53:26,982
So er...
Want to have some lunch?

930
00:53:27,062 --> 00:53:28,501
Have you heard from him?

931
00:53:28,536 --> 00:53:30,262
- Who?
- Archie.

932
00:53:30,422 --> 00:53:32,822
No, I have to finish my hair!

933
00:53:32,857 --> 00:53:33,747
Nothing?

934
00:53:33,782 --> 00:53:35,442
OK, I'm out of here!

935
00:53:35,477 --> 00:53:37,102
No plans to see him?

936
00:53:37,141 --> 00:53:38,066
No.

937
00:53:38,101 --> 00:53:39,702
OK, bye, bro!

938
00:53:40,501 --> 00:53:42,021
Bye, Wanda!

939
00:53:44,341 --> 00:53:45,821
Oh, sorry.

940
00:53:48,181 --> 00:53:50,741
- What?!
- It wasn't theirs to sell.

941
00:53:51,060 --> 00:53:53,360
A old lady gave it to them to engrave.

942
00:53:53,395 --> 00:53:55,660
Someone put it in the display cabinet...

943
00:53:55,861 --> 00:53:58,260
- That's their problem.
- No. Legally...

944
00:53:58,295 --> 00:53:59,185
You paid for it!

945
00:53:59,220 --> 00:54:02,579
They accept their mistake
and they're offering you this.

946
00:54:03,059 --> 00:54:04,464
It's much more valuable.

947
00:54:04,499 --> 00:54:07,380
I adore this
and you want me to give it back...

948
00:54:07,415 --> 00:54:09,779
- I don't want...
- They can't have it.

949
00:54:09,814 --> 00:54:10,996
- Wendy.
- No. No!

950
00:54:11,031 --> 00:54:12,144
- Wendy!
- NO!

951
00:54:12,179 --> 00:54:14,239
Tell them they can't have it!

952
00:54:14,274 --> 00:54:16,299
You're the bloody barrister!

953
00:54:49,337 --> 00:54:51,137
- Hello.
- Hello.

954
00:54:52,696 --> 00:54:54,856
Oh, Archie, it's beautiful.

955
00:54:55,576 --> 00:54:57,456
It's just beautiful.

956
00:55:00,376 --> 00:55:02,136
Oh, my God, look!

957
00:55:03,736 --> 00:55:05,895
Oh, Archie, it's beautiful.

958
00:55:06,135 --> 00:55:07,575
Isn't it wonderful?

959
00:55:07,610 --> 00:55:08,981
Whose is it?

960
00:55:09,016 --> 00:55:11,416
It belongs to someone
at the chambers.

961
00:55:11,451 --> 00:55:13,255
And where are they?

962
00:55:13,335 --> 00:55:14,715
Hong Kong.

963
00:55:14,750 --> 00:55:16,095
Ah so.

964
00:55:16,215 --> 00:55:17,895
Gone for weeks.

965
00:55:18,614 --> 00:55:20,375
Nice rug, Archie.

966
00:55:21,975 --> 00:55:23,295
May I?

967
00:55:25,814 --> 00:55:27,734
Archie, what are you doing?

968
00:55:27,769 --> 00:55:29,575
The polka, I think.

969
00:55:33,014 --> 00:55:34,974
You make me feel free!

970
00:55:35,414 --> 00:55:36,693
Free?

971
00:55:36,854 --> 00:55:39,973
Do you have any idea
what it's like being English?

972
00:55:40,693 --> 00:55:42,973
Being so correct all the time?

973
00:55:43,093 --> 00:55:46,573
Being so... stifled
by this dread of doing the wrong thing?

974
00:55:48,853 --> 00:55:51,012
Asking someone, 'Are you married?'...

975
00:55:51,047 --> 00:55:53,409
.. and hearing, 'My wife left me. '

976
00:55:53,444 --> 00:55:55,772
Or saying,
'Do you have children?'...

977
00:55:56,052 --> 00:55:58,933
.. and hearing,
'They burned to death yesterday. '

978
00:55:58,968 --> 00:56:01,812
Wanda, we're all terrified
of embarrassment.

979
00:56:03,732 --> 00:56:05,932
That's why we're so... dead.

980
00:56:07,091 --> 00:56:09,292
Most of my friends are dead.

981
00:56:09,492 --> 00:56:12,211
We have these piles of corpses to dinner.

982
00:56:13,451 --> 00:56:15,336
But you're alive, God bless you.

983
00:56:15,371 --> 00:56:18,331
And I want to be.
I'm so fed up with all this.

984
00:56:19,690 --> 00:56:22,211
I want to make love with you, Wanda.

985
00:56:23,051 --> 00:56:23,976
I'm a good lover.

986
00:56:24,011 --> 00:56:27,130
At least, I used to be
in the early 14th century.

987
00:56:29,290 --> 00:56:31,050
Can we go to bed?

988
00:56:36,010 --> 00:56:37,290
Yeah.

989
00:56:38,890 --> 00:56:40,290
Hang on!

990
00:56:40,809 --> 00:56:42,489
Mind your head.

991
00:56:43,689 --> 00:56:45,169
Agh! Aagh!

992
00:56:45,610 --> 00:56:47,209
Aaagh! Aaagh!

993
00:56:49,449 --> 00:56:51,369
I think I love you, Wanda.

994
00:56:51,404 --> 00:56:52,889
Oh, Archie.

995
00:56:53,288 --> 00:56:55,208
Can I ask you a question?

996
00:56:55,243 --> 00:56:56,133
Anything.

997
00:56:56,168 --> 00:56:57,969
Where's my locket?

998
00:56:58,569 --> 00:56:59,529
I couldn't get it.

999
00:56:59,564 --> 00:57:00,809
What?

1000
00:57:00,968 --> 00:57:02,888
Wendy wouldn't give it back. Look...

1001
00:57:02,923 --> 00:57:04,808
I got you this instead.

1002
00:57:04,843 --> 00:57:06,487
Do you like it?

1003
00:57:06,727 --> 00:57:09,087
No. Archie, I have to have mine.

1004
00:57:09,608 --> 00:57:11,607
What's the matter? Why?

1005
00:57:12,968 --> 00:57:15,088
My mother gave it to me...

1006
00:57:15,847 --> 00:57:17,808
.. on her death... bed.

1007
00:57:20,646 --> 00:57:22,286
Oh, I'm sorry.

1008
00:57:22,567 --> 00:57:24,007
All right, darling.

1009
00:57:24,042 --> 00:57:25,447
I'll get it for you.

1010
00:57:25,482 --> 00:57:26,372
You promise?

1011
00:57:26,407 --> 00:57:27,811
I'll think of something.

1012
00:57:27,846 --> 00:57:30,211
Sex is very, very difficult for me...

1013
00:57:30,246 --> 00:57:33,206
.. with somebody
that I don't trust completely.

1014
00:57:34,086 --> 00:57:36,205
I promise I'll get it. OK?

1015
00:57:36,966 --> 00:57:39,006
Ooh! I love you, Archie.

1016
00:57:40,805 --> 00:57:44,365
I've loved you ever since
the first second I saw you!

1017
00:57:47,046 --> 00:57:48,684
What was that?

1018
00:57:48,965 --> 00:57:50,245
What?

1019
00:57:50,405 --> 00:57:53,284
Your brother didn't bring you
here this time?

1020
00:57:53,319 --> 00:57:54,484
No.

1021
00:57:55,204 --> 00:57:56,609
He's no idea?

1022
00:57:56,644 --> 00:57:58,644
He doesn't have a clue.

1023
00:57:59,045 --> 00:58:00,324
What?

1024
00:58:01,004 --> 00:58:01,964
He is so dumb...

1025
00:58:01,999 --> 00:58:02,889
Really?

1026
00:58:02,924 --> 00:58:06,364
He thought the Gettysburg Address
was where Lincoln lived.

1027
00:58:10,124 --> 00:58:12,924
Those terrible lies
he told about the CIA!

1028
00:58:14,443 --> 00:58:15,368
So painful!

1029
00:58:15,403 --> 00:58:18,343
When he heard
your daughter's name was Portia,...

1030
00:58:18,378 --> 00:58:21,283
.. he said,
'Why did they name her after a car?'

1031
00:58:25,962 --> 00:58:28,043
I love the way you laugh!

1032
00:58:28,362 --> 00:58:30,442
I love you, you're funny.

1033
00:58:31,723 --> 00:58:34,203
How come a girl as bright as you...

1034
00:58:35,562 --> 00:58:37,482
.. can have a brother who's so...

1035
00:58:37,517 --> 00:58:39,401
Don't call me stupid.

1036
00:58:40,734 --> 00:58:41,962
Jesus Christ!

1037
00:58:49,001 --> 00:58:50,521
Ouch! Otto!

1038
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:52,801
Come on!

1039
00:58:53,321 --> 00:58:55,401
I'll deal with you later!

1040
00:58:56,201 --> 00:58:58,086
What have you done with her?

1041
00:58:58,121 --> 00:59:01,000
- She's all right!
- Otto!

1042
00:59:01,035 --> 00:59:02,680
Now, apologise.

1043
00:59:02,920 --> 00:59:04,200
What?

1044
00:59:06,760 --> 00:59:07,685
Shit!

1045
00:59:07,720 --> 00:59:09,799
Are you totally deranged?

1046
00:59:14,919 --> 00:59:16,640
You pompous,...

1047
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:19,479
.. stuck-up, snot-nosed,...

1048
00:59:19,719 --> 00:59:21,879
.. English, giant twerp,...

1049
00:59:22,119 --> 00:59:24,799
.. scumbag, fuck-face,
dickhead asshole!

1050
00:59:25,958 --> 00:59:27,843
How very interesting.

1051
00:59:27,878 --> 00:59:30,279
You're a true vulgarian, aren't you?

1052
00:59:30,314 --> 00:59:32,598
You're the vulgarian, you fuck!

1053
00:59:32,678 --> 00:59:34,358
Now, apologise!

1054
00:59:34,598 --> 00:59:36,398
What? Me to you

1055
00:59:41,318 --> 00:59:42,798
Apologise.

1056
00:59:44,198 --> 00:59:45,637
All right, I apologise.

1057
00:59:45,672 --> 00:59:47,042
You're really sorry?

1058
00:59:47,077 --> 00:59:48,837
I'm really, really sorry.

1059
00:59:48,872 --> 00:59:50,598
I apologise unreservedly.

1060
00:59:50,917 --> 00:59:52,321
You take it back?

1061
00:59:52,356 --> 00:59:55,202
I do.
I offer a complete and utter retraction.

1062
00:59:55,237 --> 00:59:58,477
The imputation was totally
without basis in fact,...

1063
00:59:59,077 --> 01:00:01,236
.. and was in no way fair comment.

1064
01:00:01,271 --> 01:00:03,294
It was motivated purely by malice.

1065
01:00:03,329 --> 01:00:05,282
I deeply regret any distress...

1066
01:00:05,317 --> 01:00:08,196
.. my comments
may have caused you or your family.

1067
01:00:08,231 --> 01:00:10,081
I hereby undertake not repeat...

1068
01:00:10,116 --> 01:00:13,036
.. any such slander
at any time in the future.

1069
01:00:15,875 --> 01:00:17,076
OK.

1070
01:01:17,672 --> 01:01:19,472
# Miserere Dominus

1071
01:01:21,991 --> 01:01:23,791
# Miserere Dominus

1072
01:01:27,750 --> 01:01:29,711
# Canis mortuus est...

1073
01:01:31,591 --> 01:01:33,196
You said you loved him!

1074
01:01:33,231 --> 01:01:36,230
Right, Otto!
Here's a multiple choice question.

1075
01:01:36,590 --> 01:01:38,430
A. Wanda was lying.

1076
01:01:38,510 --> 01:01:40,650
B. Wanda was telling the truth.

1077
01:01:40,685 --> 01:01:42,790
Which one are you going to pick?

1078
01:01:42,829 --> 01:01:44,234
What was the first one?

1079
01:01:44,269 --> 01:01:46,429
You said you were not seeing him!

1080
01:01:46,464 --> 01:01:48,555
I knew you'd come and fuck it up!

1081
01:01:48,590 --> 01:01:50,954
I was dealing with something delicate.

1082
01:01:50,989 --> 01:01:53,354
I'm setting up a guy
who's important to us.

1083
01:01:53,389 --> 01:01:56,268
He knows where the loot is
and if you'll be arrested.

1084
01:01:56,303 --> 01:01:58,669
You lope in
like Rambo without a jockstrap...

1085
01:01:58,704 --> 01:02:00,589
.. and dangle him from a window!

1086
01:02:00,624 --> 01:02:02,509
Now, was that smart?!

1087
01:02:02,544 --> 01:02:04,149
Was it shrewd?

1088
01:02:04,428 --> 01:02:07,068
Was it good tactics, or was it stupid?!

1089
01:02:08,749 --> 01:02:10,668
Don't call me stupid.

1090
01:02:10,703 --> 01:02:11,593
Oh, right!

1091
01:02:11,628 --> 01:02:14,508
To call you stupid
is an insult to stupid people!

1092
01:02:14,543 --> 01:02:16,907
I've known sheep that could outwit you.

1093
01:02:16,942 --> 01:02:19,272
I've worn dresses with higher IQs.

1094
01:02:19,307 --> 01:02:22,387
You think you're an intellectual,
don't you, ape?

1095
01:02:23,148 --> 01:02:25,032
Apes don't read philosophy.

1096
01:02:25,067 --> 01:02:27,947
Yes, they do.
They just don't understand it.

1097
01:02:28,907 --> 01:02:31,786
Let me correct you
on a couple of things, OK?

1098
01:02:31,821 --> 01:02:33,906
Aristotle was not Belgian.

1099
01:02:34,187 --> 01:02:36,551
The central message of Buddhism...

1100
01:02:36,586 --> 01:02:39,606
- is not every man for himself.
- You read...

1101
01:02:39,641 --> 01:02:42,626
The London Underground
is not a political movement.

1102
01:02:42,825 --> 01:02:45,226
Those are mistakes. I looked 'em up.

1103
01:02:45,261 --> 01:02:47,545
Now. You have just assaulted...

1104
01:02:47,626 --> 01:02:51,186
.. the one man who can keep you
out of jail and make you rich.

1105
01:02:51,465 --> 01:02:53,865
So what are you
going to do about it, huh?

1106
01:02:53,900 --> 01:02:56,144
What would an intellectual do?

1107
01:02:56,746 --> 01:02:58,624
What would Plato do?

1108
01:03:03,464 --> 01:03:04,945
Pardon me?

1109
01:03:06,379 --> 01:03:07,624
What?

1110
01:03:09,225 --> 01:03:10,544
Right!

1111
01:03:11,144 --> 01:03:12,624
I'm sorry.

1112
01:03:14,024 --> 01:03:15,224
No.

1113
01:03:15,464 --> 01:03:16,663
Not to me.

1114
01:03:16,698 --> 01:03:17,828
To Archie.

1115
01:03:17,863 --> 01:03:20,223
And make it good, or we're dead.

1116
01:03:26,503 --> 01:03:29,143
Oh, I'm so very,
very, very, very s...

1117
01:03:30,342 --> 01:03:31,782
Fuck you!

1118
01:03:33,223 --> 01:03:34,622
I'm s...

1119
01:03:35,143 --> 01:03:36,982
I'm very, very s...

1120
01:03:37,542 --> 01:03:38,982
I'm so...

1121
01:03:39,017 --> 01:03:40,559
.. very s...

1122
01:03:40,594 --> 01:03:42,102
Very, very s...

1123
01:03:56,742 --> 01:03:58,341
Very, very...

1124
01:03:58,661 --> 01:04:00,141
.. ssfff...

1125
01:05:08,857 --> 01:05:09,782
Ugh!

1126
01:05:09,817 --> 01:05:11,896
Hello, Mr Burglar!

1127
01:05:12,216 --> 01:05:13,621
Going somewhere?

1128
01:05:13,656 --> 01:05:15,576
Think you can rob Mr Leach?

1129
01:05:15,611 --> 01:05:17,461
I'll teach you a lesson.

1130
01:05:17,496 --> 01:05:19,856
He's a very good friend of mine.

1131
01:05:19,895 --> 01:05:21,301
Otto! Otto!

1132
01:05:21,336 --> 01:05:24,935
He'll be very pleased with me
when he finds you all tied up...

1133
01:05:25,175 --> 01:05:27,335
.. and ready for the police!

1134
01:05:28,535 --> 01:05:30,455
And don't call me Otto.

1135
01:05:30,490 --> 01:05:32,254
To you, I am Mr...

1136
01:05:39,574 --> 01:05:40,854
Aagh!

1137
01:05:41,974 --> 01:05:43,374
Oh, God.

1138
01:05:46,294 --> 01:05:48,214
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1139
01:05:48,249 --> 01:05:49,693
I'm sorry.

1140
01:05:50,134 --> 01:05:51,493
Please.

1141
01:05:52,053 --> 01:05:53,458
I'm sorry.

1142
01:05:53,493 --> 01:05:55,413
I'm sorry, I didn't know it was you.

1143
01:05:55,448 --> 01:05:57,613
How could I know it was you?

1144
01:05:57,814 --> 01:06:00,333
I mean,
how could you expect me to guess?

1145
01:06:00,368 --> 01:06:01,258
Stupid jerk!

1146
01:06:01,293 --> 01:06:04,452
What the fuck are you doing
robbing your own house?

1147
01:06:05,612 --> 01:06:07,017
You asshole!

1148
01:06:07,052 --> 01:06:09,613
You stupid, stiff, pompous English...

1149
01:06:09,933 --> 01:06:11,172
Agh!

1150
01:06:11,373 --> 01:06:13,572
I'm sorry.

1151
01:06:13,607 --> 01:06:15,772
Er... Er...

1152
01:06:16,652 --> 01:06:17,932
Yeah.

1153
01:06:57,930 --> 01:06:59,849
God Almighty!

1154
01:07:00,809 --> 01:07:02,369
Bloody hell!

1155
01:07:09,929 --> 01:07:11,328
Darling!

1156
01:07:11,849 --> 01:07:13,253
Are you hurt?

1157
01:07:13,288 --> 01:07:15,408
Speak to me! Are you hurt?

1158
01:07:17,128 --> 01:07:18,533
Can't you speak?

1159
01:07:18,568 --> 01:07:21,008
Archie! Archie, what has happened?

1160
01:07:24,328 --> 01:07:26,247
Archie, we've been burgled.

1161
01:07:26,282 --> 01:07:27,172
Oh, no!

1162
01:07:27,207 --> 01:07:28,647
Well, are you hurt?

1163
01:07:28,682 --> 01:07:30,052
No, I'm... I'm fine.

1164
01:07:30,087 --> 01:07:31,972
Bit of a headache. I er...

1165
01:07:32,007 --> 01:07:34,407
I came in here,
somebody hit me, tied me up...

1166
01:07:34,442 --> 01:07:36,327
My God, is that the time?

1167
01:07:36,362 --> 01:07:37,252
What?

1168
01:07:37,287 --> 01:07:39,686
I didn't realise it was quite so late.

1169
01:07:39,721 --> 01:07:40,611
What?!

1170
01:07:40,646 --> 01:07:42,326
I'm late for a conference.

1171
01:07:42,361 --> 01:07:43,971
You've just been attacked!

1172
01:07:44,006 --> 01:07:45,892
It's nothing, I must fly. Sorry.

1173
01:07:45,927 --> 01:07:48,326
- Archie!
- I'll help you tidy up later!

1174
01:07:48,361 --> 01:07:49,923
Hello, Portia.

1175
01:07:49,958 --> 01:07:51,485
What's happened?

1176
01:07:51,686 --> 01:07:54,685
Your father has finally gone
completely mental.

1177
01:08:17,244 --> 01:08:18,444
Hi.

1178
01:08:29,723 --> 01:08:31,084
Archie!

1179
01:08:34,043 --> 01:08:35,483
Thank you so much.

1180
01:08:35,518 --> 01:08:36,923
Champagne?

1181
01:08:36,958 --> 01:08:38,123
OK.

1182
01:08:59,962 --> 01:09:01,761
- To us.
- To us.

1183
01:09:04,281 --> 01:09:06,680
I went back to the house,
and guess who...

1184
01:09:08,313 --> 01:09:09,841
Let's make love!

1185
01:09:10,521 --> 01:09:12,441
Well, if you absolutely insist...

1186
01:09:12,476 --> 01:09:13,641
No.

1187
01:09:13,880 --> 01:09:14,805
What?

1188
01:09:14,840 --> 01:09:16,600
Here. On the rug.

1189
01:09:17,720 --> 01:09:19,160
I'll be right back.

1190
01:09:19,195 --> 01:09:20,800
Get undressed.

1191
01:09:21,560 --> 01:09:22,959
Why not?

1192
01:09:23,960 --> 01:09:25,679
Why not indeed!?

1193
01:09:28,279 --> 01:09:29,959
Afterwards,...

1194
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:31,279
Yeah?

1195
01:09:31,440 --> 01:09:33,359
.. let's go to South America.

1196
01:09:33,394 --> 01:09:34,639
What?

1197
01:09:34,799 --> 01:09:36,719
Let's fly to South America.

1198
01:09:36,754 --> 01:09:38,316
Why South America?

1199
01:09:38,351 --> 01:09:39,879
OK,... Iceland?

1200
01:09:43,439 --> 01:09:45,958
What do you really want out of life?

1201
01:09:46,318 --> 01:09:47,723
I don't know.

1202
01:09:47,758 --> 01:09:49,678
Why do I like you so much?

1203
01:09:49,713 --> 01:09:51,038
Archie.

1204
01:09:51,118 --> 01:09:52,042
Hm?

1205
01:09:52,077 --> 01:09:53,518
Do you speak Italian?

1206
01:09:53,553 --> 01:09:54,923
I am Italian!

1207
01:09:54,958 --> 01:09:56,843
Sono italiano in spirito.

1208
01:09:56,878 --> 01:10:00,477
Ma ho sposato una donna
che preferisce lavorare in giardino...

1209
01:10:01,197 --> 01:10:03,477
.. a fare I'amore appassionato.

1210
01:10:03,597 --> 01:10:05,003
Uno sbaglio grande!

1211
01:10:05,038 --> 01:10:07,357
But it's such an ugly language.

1212
01:10:08,397 --> 01:10:10,282
How about... Russian?

1213
01:10:10,317 --> 01:10:13,316
Yest' sila blagodatnaya
sozvuchiy slov zhivykh.

1214
01:10:15,596 --> 01:10:18,996
Kamina tozhe ni trudnuyu tyesnitsya
Iyubosyat'sya grust'.

1215
01:10:22,316 --> 01:10:25,116
Odnu molitvu chudnuyu
tverzhdaya naizust'.

1216
01:10:27,115 --> 01:10:30,116
V dushe kak bremya skatyatsya
somneniya daleko.

1217
01:10:32,875 --> 01:10:35,515
I varitsya i plachetsya, i tak legko...

1218
01:10:36,235 --> 01:10:37,595
Archie!

1219
01:10:37,675 --> 01:10:38,955
Yeah?

1220
01:10:39,114 --> 01:10:40,520
Are you rich?

1221
01:10:40,555 --> 01:10:41,995
No, no, I'm afraid not.

1222
01:10:42,030 --> 01:10:43,400
What about the house?

1223
01:10:43,435 --> 01:10:46,074
Oh, that's Wendy's. She's the rich one.

1224
01:10:46,794 --> 01:10:47,994
Oh.

1225
01:10:52,073 --> 01:10:55,074
Yest' sila blagodatnaya
sozvuchiy slov zhivykh.

1226
01:10:55,914 --> 01:10:59,153
I tushit nyeponyatnaya,
svetlaya, prelyestnaya rech'.

1227
01:11:01,394 --> 01:11:04,393
V dushe kak bremya skatyatsya
somneniya daleko.

1228
01:11:06,673 --> 01:11:09,233
I varitsya i plachetsya, i tak legko!

1229
01:11:28,271 --> 01:11:32,071
- What the hell are you doing?
- I might ask you the same question!

1230
01:11:33,552 --> 01:11:34,512
Who are you?

1231
01:11:34,547 --> 01:11:35,436
What?!

1232
01:11:35,471 --> 01:11:36,876
Get your clothes on.

1233
01:11:36,911 --> 01:11:39,791
- Will you leave immediately, please?
- What?!

1234
01:11:39,826 --> 01:11:41,196
You're in the wrong flat.

1235
01:11:41,231 --> 01:11:43,791
This flat belongs to Patrick Balfour.

1236
01:11:44,151 --> 01:11:45,076
He's in Hong Kong.

1237
01:11:45,111 --> 01:11:46,995
He lent me the key. Now get out!

1238
01:11:47,030 --> 01:11:49,831
We leased it
from the agents last weekend.

1239
01:11:55,190 --> 01:11:58,430
Yes, well obviously
that changes things a bit. Erm...

1240
01:11:59,989 --> 01:12:02,029
Aren't you Archie Leach?

1241
01:12:03,349 --> 01:12:04,629
What?

1242
01:12:04,790 --> 01:12:07,589
You bought our house
in Lissendon Gardens.

1243
01:12:07,669 --> 01:12:09,629
Hazel and Ian Johnson.

1244
01:12:12,948 --> 01:12:14,789
What a coincidence!

1245
01:12:15,348 --> 01:12:16,628
Ha...

1246
01:12:16,789 --> 01:12:18,668
How nice to see you.

1247
01:12:46,586 --> 01:12:47,906
Hello.

1248
01:12:48,026 --> 01:12:50,106
Hello, Wanda. It's Archie

1249
01:12:51,387 --> 01:12:54,266
I can't see you any more.
I've got to end it.

1250
01:12:54,301 --> 01:12:55,226
I'm sorry.

1251
01:12:55,261 --> 01:12:56,506
What?

1252
01:12:58,105 --> 01:12:59,586
I'm sorry.

1253
01:13:01,700 --> 01:13:02,825
Archie?

1254
01:13:31,224 --> 01:13:32,504
Er...

1255
01:13:33,623 --> 01:13:34,823
OK.

1256
01:13:35,063 --> 01:13:36,469
Oh, no, no. Please.

1257
01:13:36,504 --> 01:13:38,424
Look, I want to apologise.

1258
01:13:38,459 --> 01:13:39,863
I just finished it.

1259
01:13:39,898 --> 01:13:40,788
OK, OK, wait.

1260
01:13:40,823 --> 01:13:43,223
Where are you going?
I want speak with you.

1261
01:13:43,258 --> 01:13:45,262
Will you leave me alone?

1262
01:13:45,622 --> 01:13:47,027
I've ended it, all right?

1263
01:13:47,062 --> 01:13:48,982
Wait! I want to say I'm sorry.

1264
01:13:49,017 --> 01:13:50,919
It's all over, OK? It's over.

1265
01:13:50,954 --> 01:13:53,068
- All right!
- Jesus Christ!

1266
01:13:53,103 --> 01:13:55,182
- Calm down!
- Someone help me!

1267
01:13:55,222 --> 01:13:57,587
- Please believe me!
- It's all right!

1268
01:13:57,622 --> 01:14:00,502
Don't beat me up again.
I've had a terrible day.

1269
01:14:00,537 --> 01:14:01,427
Will you shut up?!

1270
01:14:01,462 --> 01:14:03,661
Jesus Christ, don't kill me!

1271
01:14:03,862 --> 01:14:05,502
Shut up, then.

1272
01:14:05,781 --> 01:14:06,981
OK.

1273
01:14:07,221 --> 01:14:08,146
Look.

1274
01:14:08,181 --> 01:14:10,101
I just want to apologise...

1275
01:14:10,136 --> 01:14:11,541
.. sincerely...

1276
01:14:12,502 --> 01:14:14,421
When I hung you from the window.

1277
01:14:14,456 --> 01:14:16,060
I'm really...

1278
01:14:16,341 --> 01:14:18,260
It was not a nice thing to do.

1279
01:14:18,295 --> 01:14:20,180
Then when I attacked you in there.

1280
01:14:20,215 --> 01:14:21,585
I'm really, s...

1281
01:14:21,620 --> 01:14:24,460
How did I know
you were robbing your house?

1282
01:14:24,501 --> 01:14:26,120
I was trying to help!

1283
01:14:26,155 --> 01:14:27,740
Yes. Thanks. Otto.

1284
01:14:27,860 --> 01:14:29,840
I wanted you to trust me.

1285
01:14:29,875 --> 01:14:31,820
Please, it was my fault.

1286
01:14:32,659 --> 01:14:34,099
- That's true.
- Yeah.

1287
01:14:34,134 --> 01:14:35,539
Now, about my sister.

1288
01:14:35,574 --> 01:14:36,465
Otto,...

1289
01:14:36,500 --> 01:14:38,385
She's a very sexy girl.

1290
01:14:38,420 --> 01:14:40,819
I understand
you wanting to play around with her.

1291
01:14:40,854 --> 01:14:43,179
It's OK, I was wrong. I'm sorry!

1292
01:14:43,699 --> 01:14:44,624
I was jealous.

1293
01:14:44,659 --> 01:14:46,938
Just go ahead, pork away, pal.

1294
01:14:48,018 --> 01:14:49,424
Fuck her blue.

1295
01:14:49,459 --> 01:14:51,298
I like you, Archie.

1296
01:14:51,379 --> 01:14:53,259
I just want to help.

1297
01:15:56,455 --> 01:15:57,854
Oh, God!

1298
01:16:33,412 --> 01:16:35,612
Send for an ambulance!

1299
01:16:55,010 --> 01:16:56,451
Shocking!

1300
01:16:59,810 --> 01:17:01,250
I did it!

1301
01:17:01,730 --> 01:17:03,390
I did it! I did it!

1302
01:17:03,425 --> 01:17:05,050
Unbe-fuck-alievable!

1303
01:17:06,049 --> 01:17:07,409
Thomason!

1304
01:17:07,444 --> 01:17:08,769
Yeah?

1305
01:17:12,289 --> 01:17:14,249
You done well, my son.

1306
01:17:15,169 --> 01:17:17,054
Now, here's the plan.

1307
01:17:17,089 --> 01:17:20,569
You get four tickets
for this evening for Rio, first class.

1308
01:17:20,929 --> 01:17:22,849
- Then...
- F-f-f...

1309
01:17:22,884 --> 01:17:24,254
Yeah, four.

1310
01:17:24,289 --> 01:17:25,693
We get rid of Otto later.

1311
01:17:25,728 --> 01:17:28,488
Then, back to the flat,
pack, collect me.

1312
01:17:28,608 --> 01:17:31,967
Then to the Cathcart Towers Hotel
to pick up the jewels.

1313
01:17:34,848 --> 01:17:36,728
Unbe-fuck-alievable!

1314
01:17:39,647 --> 01:17:41,008
Oi! Oi!

1315
01:17:44,448 --> 01:17:46,847
It's so exciting,
I can't believe it!

1316
01:17:46,882 --> 01:17:48,064
He's s-s-safe.

1317
01:17:49,247 --> 01:17:51,566
I'm going to be late for court!

1318
01:17:53,086 --> 01:17:54,486
H- Hello.

1319
01:17:54,526 --> 01:17:56,086
Hello, Otto.

1320
01:17:57,887 --> 01:18:00,086
No, she just er... I-I-left.

1321
01:18:01,246 --> 01:18:02,926
Oh, and Otto...

1322
01:18:03,646 --> 01:18:05,565
You owe me a p-p-p...

1323
01:18:07,286 --> 01:18:08,566
What?

1324
01:18:10,165 --> 01:18:12,166
You owe me a p-p-pound.

1325
01:18:14,005 --> 01:18:15,525
Not Granny?

1326
01:18:15,925 --> 01:18:17,925
M- met with an accident.

1327
01:18:20,725 --> 01:18:22,725
Bullshit! You're Iying.

1328
01:18:24,084 --> 01:18:25,365
Dead?

1329
01:18:31,284 --> 01:18:32,689
I don't believe this.

1330
01:18:32,724 --> 01:18:35,124
So, George will be out this afternoon.

1331
01:18:35,159 --> 01:18:37,061
We all go out to Heathrow,...

1332
01:18:37,096 --> 01:18:38,963
.. collect the loot and...

1333
01:18:40,615 --> 01:18:42,163
All thanks to me.

1334
01:18:47,123 --> 01:18:49,843
So the loot's at the airport, is it, Ken?

1335
01:18:59,602 --> 01:19:01,522
What's h-h-happening?

1336
01:19:02,962 --> 01:19:04,368
Well, Ken.

1337
01:19:04,403 --> 01:19:06,802
I'm going to ask you some questions...

1338
01:19:06,837 --> 01:19:08,722
.. while I eat my chips.

1339
01:19:08,757 --> 01:19:10,042
First.

1340
01:19:10,162 --> 01:19:11,566
Who was the philosopher...

1341
01:19:11,601 --> 01:19:14,481
.. who developed
the concept of the superman...

1342
01:19:14,516 --> 01:19:16,762
.. in Also Spracht Zarathustra?

1343
01:19:18,321 --> 01:19:19,561
No?!

1344
01:19:20,241 --> 01:19:22,841
That's a chip up the nose, I'm afraid.

1345
01:19:24,080 --> 01:19:25,520
Friedrich Nietzsche.

1346
01:19:25,555 --> 01:19:26,800
Next.

1347
01:19:26,960 --> 01:19:29,326
In which book did Nietzsche claim...

1348
01:19:29,361 --> 01:19:32,600
.. that almost all higher culture
is based on cruelty?

1349
01:19:34,160 --> 01:19:37,000
Are you thinking
or are you in mid-stutter?

1350
01:19:37,040 --> 01:19:38,640
You're m-mad.

1351
01:19:40,400 --> 01:19:42,320
Beyond Good And Evil.

1352
01:19:44,240 --> 01:19:46,159
I'll have to ask you an easy one.

1353
01:19:46,194 --> 01:19:47,639
OK. Erm...

1354
01:19:48,079 --> 01:19:50,239
Let me think, let me think.

1355
01:19:50,479 --> 01:19:52,479
Where are the diamonds?

1356
01:19:52,879 --> 01:19:54,764
I'll give you a clue.

1357
01:19:54,799 --> 01:19:56,998
Somewhere round the airport.

1358
01:20:00,078 --> 01:20:02,443
No hassle, there's plenty of time.

1359
01:20:02,478 --> 01:20:05,718
I'll just sit here and eat my chips
till you tell me.

1360
01:20:08,238 --> 01:20:10,998
The English contribution to world cuisine.

1361
01:20:11,118 --> 01:20:12,522
The chip.

1362
01:20:12,557 --> 01:20:15,478
What do the English
usually eat with chips...

1363
01:20:15,917 --> 01:20:18,277
.. to make them more interesting?

1364
01:20:19,277 --> 01:20:20,917
Wait a moment!

1365
01:20:23,117 --> 01:20:25,036
It's fish, isn't it?!

1366
01:20:29,357 --> 01:20:30,836
Here, boy.

1367
01:20:31,757 --> 01:20:33,436
Down the hatch.

1368
01:20:37,036 --> 01:20:38,535
Delicious!

1369
01:20:38,570 --> 01:20:40,035
You b-b-b...

1370
01:20:40,516 --> 01:20:42,755
Better eat the green one? OK?

1371
01:20:43,396 --> 01:20:45,396
What's this one's name?

1372
01:20:45,795 --> 01:20:47,715
Well, not Wanda, anyway.

1373
01:20:47,750 --> 01:20:49,635
I'm going to call her Lunch.

1374
01:20:49,670 --> 01:20:51,515
Hello, Lunch. Hello!

1375
01:20:56,355 --> 01:20:57,635
Eugh!

1376
01:20:58,275 --> 01:21:00,194
Avoid the green ones.

1377
01:21:00,229 --> 01:21:02,114
They're not ripe yet.

1378
01:21:03,554 --> 01:21:07,314
You were in court, Inspector,
when the forensic evidence was read?

1379
01:21:07,874 --> 01:21:08,799
Yes, sir.

1380
01:21:08,834 --> 01:21:12,154
And the fact that Mr Thomason
was installing windows...

1381
01:21:12,673 --> 01:21:14,078
.. the previous weekend,...

1382
01:21:14,113 --> 01:21:18,153
.. would explain the presence of
small particles of glass on his trousers.

1383
01:21:21,793 --> 01:21:23,673
No hurry, Inspector.

1384
01:21:23,713 --> 01:21:25,793
Please do take your time.

1385
01:21:32,352 --> 01:21:34,072
I'm almost full.

1386
01:21:35,232 --> 01:21:36,593
Almost.

1387
01:21:36,672 --> 01:21:38,272
Stop!

1388
01:21:38,591 --> 01:21:40,232
Please, don't.

1389
01:21:40,512 --> 01:21:41,472
Come on, Wanda!

1390
01:21:42,912 --> 01:21:44,472
Gullet time!

1391
01:21:46,271 --> 01:21:49,391
What are the names
of those hotels by the airport?

1392
01:21:49,631 --> 01:21:51,071
The Airway Sheraton?

1393
01:21:51,106 --> 01:21:51,995
The Post House?

1394
01:21:52,030 --> 01:21:53,436
The Cathcart Towers?

1395
01:21:53,471 --> 01:21:55,551
The Cathcart Towers? Yes?

1396
01:21:57,311 --> 01:21:58,670
Mm? Mm?

1397
01:22:00,190 --> 01:22:01,115
Yes.

1398
01:22:01,150 --> 01:22:03,070
In the safe deposit box?

1399
01:22:03,105 --> 01:22:03,995
Yes.

1400
01:22:04,030 --> 01:22:05,951
Where's the key?

1401
01:22:05,986 --> 01:22:06,875
What?

1402
01:22:06,910 --> 01:22:07,835
Where's the key?

1403
01:22:07,870 --> 01:22:09,790
It's in the t-t-tank.

1404
01:22:12,190 --> 01:22:13,749
Where? Where?

1405
01:22:13,784 --> 01:22:15,309
In the t-t-t...

1406
01:22:16,029 --> 01:22:17,710
Treasure chest!

1407
01:22:21,789 --> 01:22:23,149
Where?!

1408
01:22:24,189 --> 01:22:25,509
Where?

1409
01:22:25,628 --> 01:22:26,828
Oh!

1410
01:22:27,548 --> 01:22:29,109
You m-m-m...

1411
01:22:30,909 --> 01:22:32,789
.. murdering k-k-k...

1412
01:22:34,748 --> 01:22:36,988
I'll kill you, I'll kill you!

1413
01:22:39,547 --> 01:22:42,348
Sorry, Ken,
but your answer was incorrect.

1414
01:22:43,388 --> 01:22:46,747
Still, you really did think
it was in there, didn't you?

1415
01:22:48,667 --> 01:22:49,947
What?

1416
01:22:50,587 --> 01:22:51,787
Oh!

1417
01:22:59,706 --> 01:23:02,466
- Hello?
- I know where the diamonds are.

1418
01:23:03,546 --> 01:23:04,472
Where?

1419
01:23:04,507 --> 01:23:06,226
Where's the key?

1420
01:23:09,786 --> 01:23:10,711
I've got it.

1421
01:23:10,746 --> 01:23:13,426
When can you get
to George's apartment?

1422
01:23:14,626 --> 01:23:16,511
You are Wanda Gershwitz,...

1423
01:23:16,546 --> 01:23:19,506
.. of Kipling Mansions,
Murray Road, London W9?

1424
01:23:20,385 --> 01:23:21,626
Yes.

1425
01:23:22,305 --> 01:23:24,225
Would you tell the court,...

1426
01:23:24,260 --> 01:23:26,110
.. how do you know the defendant?

1427
01:23:26,145 --> 01:23:28,785
We've had a relationship for two years.

1428
01:23:29,985 --> 01:23:31,584
Relationship?

1429
01:23:31,904 --> 01:23:33,944
We're lovers, your lord.

1430
01:23:36,224 --> 01:23:39,184
Miss Gershwitz,
on 4th March of this year,...

1431
01:23:40,064 --> 01:23:41,264
.. in the morning,...

1432
01:23:41,299 --> 01:23:42,429
.. where were you?

1433
01:23:42,464 --> 01:23:44,348
At the apartment at Murray Road.

1434
01:23:44,383 --> 01:23:47,623
And were you by yourself,
or was anyone else present?

1435
01:23:47,743 --> 01:23:49,943
No. Somebody else was there.

1436
01:23:50,144 --> 01:23:51,624
Who was that?

1437
01:23:51,659 --> 01:23:53,104
My brother.

1438
01:23:53,503 --> 01:23:55,183
Did your b...?

1439
01:23:58,302 --> 01:23:59,903
Your brother?

1440
01:24:01,183 --> 01:24:02,702
My brother.

1441
01:24:05,502 --> 01:24:06,742
Yes.

1442
01:24:07,902 --> 01:24:09,422
Yes, and...

1443
01:24:10,782 --> 01:24:13,302
Are you quite sure it was your brother?

1444
01:24:13,337 --> 01:24:15,822
I'm sure she can recognise her brother.

1445
01:24:23,261 --> 01:24:26,261
W- w-was there
anyone else present that morning?

1446
01:24:27,101 --> 01:24:29,061
Yes, George was there.

1447
01:24:29,501 --> 01:24:30,941
But he left about 6.55.

1448
01:24:30,976 --> 01:24:32,260
Wanda!

1449
01:24:32,860 --> 01:24:34,461
I- I wonder...

1450
01:24:34,780 --> 01:24:36,300
I wonder...

1451
01:24:38,141 --> 01:24:39,660
I wonder...

1452
01:24:47,739 --> 01:24:49,379
Yes, Mr Leach?

1453
01:24:50,620 --> 01:24:52,299
I Wendy... I Wanda...

1454
01:24:52,334 --> 01:24:54,196
I wonder... I w-w-w...

1455
01:24:54,231 --> 01:24:56,058
Wh-when you say 6.55,...

1456
01:24:57,339 --> 01:24:59,498
.. Miss er... Gershwitz,...

1457
01:24:59,738 --> 01:25:01,819
.. how can you be so sure?

1458
01:25:02,139 --> 01:25:03,818
Oh, I looked at the clock.

1459
01:25:03,853 --> 01:25:05,463
Cos I said to myself,...

1460
01:25:05,498 --> 01:25:09,058
'Where could he be going at 6.55
with that sawn-off shotgun?'

1461
01:25:09,338 --> 01:25:10,738
Darling!

1462
01:25:11,258 --> 01:25:12,677
Mr Leach.

1463
01:25:12,712 --> 01:25:14,097
Darling?

1464
01:25:14,138 --> 01:25:15,338
Yes, dear?

1465
01:25:15,373 --> 01:25:16,503
You bitch!

1466
01:25:16,538 --> 01:25:18,097
You fucking bitch!

1467
01:25:21,817 --> 01:25:23,617
Restrain that man!

1468
01:25:29,017 --> 01:25:30,422
Restrain this man.

1469
01:25:30,457 --> 01:25:31,862
Come 'ere, you bastard!

1470
01:25:31,897 --> 01:25:34,776
Clear the court!
I'm adjourning this for an hour.

1471
01:25:34,811 --> 01:25:36,497
Clear the court!

1472
01:25:46,295 --> 01:25:47,700
Clear the court!

1473
01:25:47,735 --> 01:25:49,656
Clear the court! Clear the court!

1474
01:25:49,691 --> 01:25:51,775
Officers, arrest that man!

1475
01:25:57,335 --> 01:25:59,734
Clear the court! Clear the court!

1476
01:26:11,254 --> 01:26:13,134
Bloody hell!

1477
01:26:13,175 --> 01:26:15,494
It's my husband, he's been hit.

1478
01:26:16,054 --> 01:26:17,459
Ah, you made it. Good.

1479
01:26:17,494 --> 01:26:19,734
A bit of a knock, I'm afraid.

1480
01:26:20,853 --> 01:26:23,693
I have never been
so humiliated in my life.

1481
01:26:24,213 --> 01:26:27,093
You can stick this marriage
right in your bottom!

1482
01:26:27,128 --> 01:26:29,053
I'll see you in court.

1483
01:26:38,133 --> 01:26:39,372
Yes.

1484
01:26:41,492 --> 01:26:42,772
Well.

1485
01:26:43,412 --> 01:26:45,132
That's it, then.

1486
01:26:48,211 --> 01:26:49,572
George.

1487
01:26:49,652 --> 01:26:51,891
- What?
- We've got to talk.

1488
01:26:52,052 --> 01:26:53,971
Tell those pigs to fuck off.

1489
01:26:54,006 --> 01:26:55,651
Fuck off, pigs.

1490
01:26:58,291 --> 01:26:59,730
Did you hear what I said?

1491
01:26:59,765 --> 01:27:01,171
Fuck off.

1492
01:27:05,971 --> 01:27:07,890
What's she up to, George?

1493
01:27:07,925 --> 01:27:09,731
What are you up to?

1494
01:27:09,810 --> 01:27:11,250
You called her darling,...

1495
01:27:11,285 --> 01:27:12,656
.. and Wanda.

1496
01:27:12,691 --> 01:27:15,570
I've been helping her
get her evidence straight.

1497
01:27:15,605 --> 01:27:16,975
It slipped out.

1498
01:27:17,010 --> 01:27:18,895
Have you been coaching her?

1499
01:27:18,930 --> 01:27:21,329
What do you think?!
We've got ten minutes.

1500
01:27:21,364 --> 01:27:23,214
They'll find you guilty, right?

1501
01:27:23,249 --> 01:27:26,809
Plead guilty now, tell them
where the loot is, you may get...

1502
01:27:27,090 --> 01:27:29,454
.. eight years, out in five and a half.

1503
01:27:29,489 --> 01:27:32,369
What if I tell them about Otto...
and Wanda?

1504
01:27:32,404 --> 01:27:33,808
- They both did it?
- Yeah.

1505
01:27:33,843 --> 01:27:35,213
Great, all right.

1506
01:27:35,248 --> 01:27:37,268
Maybe six years, out in four?

1507
01:27:37,303 --> 01:27:39,288
So where are the diamonds?

1508
01:27:40,049 --> 01:27:41,453
Where's Bartlett?

1509
01:27:41,488 --> 01:27:43,408
Upstairs, calming things down.

1510
01:27:43,443 --> 01:27:44,813
So, where are they?

1511
01:27:44,848 --> 01:27:47,487
Tell Bartlett Ken knows where they are.

1512
01:27:48,688 --> 01:27:51,607
George, it'd be a lot quicker
if you told me.

1513
01:27:54,927 --> 01:27:56,847
OK! I'll tell Bartlett.

1514
01:27:56,882 --> 01:27:58,407
Where's Ken?

1515
01:27:58,767 --> 01:28:00,527
He's at the flat.

1516
01:28:05,286 --> 01:28:07,206
Thank you for all your help.

1517
01:28:07,241 --> 01:28:09,007
I'll be right out.

1518
01:28:22,566 --> 01:28:24,085
Taxi! Taxi!

1519
01:28:24,486 --> 01:28:25,445
Please... shit!

1520
01:28:25,480 --> 01:28:26,726
Taxi!

1521
01:28:26,885 --> 01:28:28,285
Come on.

1522
01:28:28,325 --> 01:28:29,250
- What?
- Let's go.

1523
01:28:29,285 --> 01:28:30,690
- Where?
- Buenos Aires.

1524
01:28:30,725 --> 01:28:33,605
- What?
- We're going to George's flat first.

1525
01:28:33,640 --> 01:28:34,965
Get in.

1526
01:28:38,405 --> 01:28:39,844
Got your passport?

1527
01:28:39,879 --> 01:28:40,769
Yeah.

1528
01:28:40,804 --> 01:28:42,724
Check the briefcase for mine.

1529
01:28:42,759 --> 01:28:44,564
Get your head down.

1530
01:28:49,924 --> 01:28:53,244
So, you robbed the jeweller's,
turned one lover in,...

1531
01:28:53,283 --> 01:28:56,123
.. and kept one to help you
find the diamonds.

1532
01:28:56,158 --> 01:28:58,963
When he does,
you commit perjury in court.

1533
01:28:59,044 --> 01:29:00,963
Everyone does it in America.

1534
01:29:00,998 --> 01:29:01,888
Not in this country!

1535
01:29:01,923 --> 01:29:04,283
Right Nobody lies in England.

1536
01:29:04,323 --> 01:29:08,162
- Like Margaret Thatcher never lied.
- You lied to me from the start.

1537
01:29:08,197 --> 01:29:11,842
- You just wanted to get me into bed.
- I fell in love with you!

1538
01:29:16,322 --> 01:29:18,562
How come you dumped me, then?

1539
01:29:19,201 --> 01:29:21,522
I wasn't rich enough, remember?

1540
01:29:32,642 --> 01:29:34,081
Say something in Russian.

1541
01:29:34,116 --> 01:29:35,281
No!

1542
01:29:39,840 --> 01:29:41,725
What are you thinking, Archie?

1543
01:29:41,760 --> 01:29:44,160
I'm trying to find one good reason...

1544
01:29:44,195 --> 01:29:46,560
.. why I should take you away with me.

1545
01:29:46,595 --> 01:29:48,120
How about...

1546
01:29:48,480 --> 01:29:51,639
.. because I have the key
to the safety deposit box.

1547
01:29:52,320 --> 01:29:54,520
That's a good reason!

1548
01:29:58,080 --> 01:29:59,520
What do we do about Otto?

1549
01:29:59,555 --> 01:30:00,924
I'll handle Otto.

1550
01:30:00,959 --> 01:30:03,119
Be careful, he's dangerous.

1551
01:30:03,359 --> 01:30:04,759
So am I.

1552
01:30:04,799 --> 01:30:06,519
Keep it running.

1553
01:30:09,599 --> 01:30:11,964
- Why did you bring him?
- Otto, wait!

1554
01:30:11,999 --> 01:30:14,878
- I'm beginning to think you like him!
- Wait!

1555
01:30:14,913 --> 01:30:16,479
Let's get the diamonds!

1556
01:30:16,514 --> 01:30:17,436
Ken!

1557
01:30:18,729 --> 01:30:19,917
Are you Ken?

1558
01:30:21,718 --> 01:30:22,643
How do you do?

1559
01:30:22,678 --> 01:30:24,598
I'm George's barrister.

1560
01:30:27,290 --> 01:30:28,583
Oh, my God!

1561
01:30:28,618 --> 01:30:29,842
Asshole!

1562
01:30:29,877 --> 01:30:32,278
What the bloody hell...

1563
01:30:32,313 --> 01:30:34,157
Oh, all right, then.

1564
01:30:35,157 --> 01:30:36,517
Archie!

1565
01:30:38,037 --> 01:30:39,442
Where have they gone?

1566
01:30:39,477 --> 01:30:41,516
Quick! Where have they gone?

1567
01:30:41,551 --> 01:30:43,556
They've go... they've go...

1568
01:30:43,796 --> 01:30:44,722
What?

1569
01:30:46,197 --> 01:30:47,996
Are you all right?

1570
01:30:48,116 --> 01:30:49,556
Where have they gone?

1571
01:30:49,591 --> 01:30:50,996
They've gone to the...

1572
01:30:51,031 --> 01:30:51,921
.. the Ca-ca-ca...

1573
01:30:51,956 --> 01:30:53,875
- Are you ill?
- No, no, no.

1574
01:30:53,910 --> 01:30:54,800
What?

1575
01:30:54,835 --> 01:30:55,760
Ca-ca-ca...

1576
01:30:55,795 --> 01:30:57,455
Have you got a stutter?

1577
01:30:57,490 --> 01:30:59,115
Yeah, I have. A bit.

1578
01:30:59,636 --> 01:31:01,040
OK, fine. Don't worry.

1579
01:31:01,075 --> 01:31:03,395
Do you know where they've gone?

1580
01:31:03,475 --> 01:31:04,400
Yeah.

1581
01:31:04,435 --> 01:31:05,875
Fine, fine. Where?

1582
01:31:05,910 --> 01:31:07,434
The Ca-ca...

1583
01:31:08,755 --> 01:31:10,154
.. Hotel.

1584
01:31:10,675 --> 01:31:11,600
Hotel?

1585
01:31:11,635 --> 01:31:13,195
Which hotel?

1586
01:31:14,034 --> 01:31:15,315
Ca...

1587
01:31:15,954 --> 01:31:17,795
The Ca... The Ca...

1588
01:31:18,354 --> 01:31:19,554
Go on, go on.

1589
01:31:19,589 --> 01:31:20,651
Ca-ca-ca...

1590
01:31:20,686 --> 01:31:21,679
It's OK.

1591
01:31:21,714 --> 01:31:23,953
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

1592
01:31:24,594 --> 01:31:26,474
Slowly. Very slowly.

1593
01:31:26,514 --> 01:31:27,873
Slowly.

1594
01:31:29,873 --> 01:31:31,313
The Ca...

1595
01:31:32,754 --> 01:31:34,233
The Caa...

1596
01:31:35,153 --> 01:31:36,313
The...

1597
01:31:36,348 --> 01:31:37,473
.. Ca...

1598
01:31:37,553 --> 01:31:38,753
The Caa...

1599
01:31:38,788 --> 01:31:39,918
No hurry.

1600
01:31:39,953 --> 01:31:41,632
The C-C-Caaa...

1601
01:31:41,872 --> 01:31:43,312
Sing it. Sing.

1602
01:31:43,347 --> 01:31:44,753
# The Caa

1603
01:31:45,713 --> 01:31:47,118
# The Caa

1604
01:31:47,153 --> 01:31:48,952
# The Caa, the Caa

1605
01:31:50,472 --> 01:31:51,397
# Caa

1606
01:31:51,432 --> 01:31:52,392
Plenty of time.

1607
01:31:52,427 --> 01:31:53,672
# Caa

1608
01:31:54,792 --> 01:31:55,751
# Caa

1609
01:31:55,786 --> 01:31:56,968
# The Caa

1610
01:31:57,003 --> 01:31:58,116
Oh, come on!

1611
01:31:58,151 --> 01:31:59,591
Sorry. I'm sorry.

1612
01:31:59,626 --> 01:32:00,912
Erm...

1613
01:32:02,472 --> 01:32:03,911
# The Caa

1614
01:32:06,311 --> 01:32:07,991
Here. Write it.

1615
01:32:19,270 --> 01:32:20,949
Cathcart Towers Hotel?

1616
01:32:20,984 --> 01:32:22,629
Cathcart Towers Hotel.

1617
01:32:22,664 --> 01:32:24,189
Where is it?

1618
01:32:24,550 --> 01:32:26,630
Ken, where is it? Where?!

1619
01:32:29,350 --> 01:32:30,870
No, no, no.

1620
01:32:38,024 --> 01:32:39,748
Heathrow Airport.

1621
01:32:50,948 --> 01:32:52,388
Hey! What's the idea?

1622
01:32:52,423 --> 01:32:53,793
You can't stay...

1623
01:32:53,828 --> 01:32:56,348
Terribly sorry. Take it, it's yours.

1624
01:33:03,428 --> 01:33:04,352
Thank you so much.

1625
01:33:04,387 --> 01:33:06,307
Er... British Airways to Rio.

1626
01:33:06,342 --> 01:33:08,146
Rio? Terminal Four.

1627
01:33:08,227 --> 01:33:09,707
Thank you.

1628
01:33:14,947 --> 01:33:17,346
Excuse me, sir. Is this your vehicle?

1629
01:33:17,381 --> 01:33:19,266
I'll be with you in a moment.

1630
01:33:19,301 --> 01:33:21,107
I'll be right back.

1631
01:33:21,587 --> 01:33:23,945
Aisle or window?
Smoking or non-smoking?

1632
01:33:23,980 --> 01:33:25,351
What was the middle one?

1633
01:33:25,386 --> 01:33:27,745
Anything in non-smoking, thanks.

1634
01:33:27,786 --> 01:33:29,865
Gate 14 is boarding now.

1635
01:33:51,784 --> 01:33:53,024
Rio!

1636
01:33:53,704 --> 01:33:56,584
Otto, don't look back,
there's a cop behind us.

1637
01:33:56,619 --> 01:33:57,903
Quick!

1638
01:34:01,864 --> 01:34:03,784
Yes, we can just do it, Mr Leach.

1639
01:34:03,819 --> 01:34:05,103
Great.

1640
01:34:05,223 --> 01:34:07,103
Luggage?

1641
01:34:09,543 --> 01:34:11,543
Don't really need any.

1642
01:34:11,578 --> 01:34:13,543
- Gate 14.
- Thank you.

1643
01:34:14,823 --> 01:34:16,662
Ciao, stupidissimo.

1644
01:34:22,982 --> 01:34:24,183
Ow!

1645
01:34:25,382 --> 01:34:26,702
Aargh!

1646
01:34:45,060 --> 01:34:46,781
Come on, Archie.

1647
01:34:46,980 --> 01:34:48,781
Pick up the phone.

1648
01:34:55,140 --> 01:34:57,420
Ticket, sir. Airport security.

1649
01:34:57,539 --> 01:34:59,459
May I see your boarding pass?

1650
01:34:59,494 --> 01:35:00,865
Oh, yes. Certainly.

1651
01:35:00,900 --> 01:35:04,140
Very good. Would you mind
stepping over here, please?

1652
01:35:04,260 --> 01:35:05,184
Of course.

1653
01:35:05,219 --> 01:35:07,579
- Oh, look, the Queen.
- Where?

1654
01:35:11,938 --> 01:35:13,859
OK, OK, OK, don't get excited.

1655
01:35:13,894 --> 01:35:15,378
OK, OK, OK.

1656
01:35:17,699 --> 01:35:20,578
Oh, it's you!
I was actually worried for a minute.

1657
01:35:20,613 --> 01:35:22,463
- Keep your hands up.
- No!

1658
01:35:22,498 --> 01:35:24,899
- Put 'em up!
- I'll make a deal with you.

1659
01:35:24,934 --> 01:35:26,303
I'll put one up.

1660
01:35:26,338 --> 01:35:28,258
Put the other one up!

1661
01:35:28,738 --> 01:35:30,577
Which looks better?

1662
01:35:31,617 --> 01:35:33,578
I'm warning you, Otto.

1663
01:35:34,017 --> 01:35:35,422
What are you going to do?

1664
01:35:35,457 --> 01:35:38,698
Shoot me? Gun me down in cold blood,
like a dog? Hey?

1665
01:35:38,817 --> 01:35:42,177
If you want to settle something,
fight me. You're a man.

1666
01:35:42,657 --> 01:35:44,936
Let's fight like men! Come on!

1667
01:35:46,016 --> 01:35:47,497
All right.

1668
01:35:47,936 --> 01:35:49,656
All right, then.

1669
01:35:49,857 --> 01:35:51,216
OK. OK.

1670
01:35:51,777 --> 01:35:53,657
You look good, Arch.

1671
01:35:53,696 --> 01:35:56,061
That's right. I used to box for Oxford.

1672
01:35:56,096 --> 01:35:58,495
Oh, yeah?
Well, I used to kill for the CIA.

1673
01:35:58,530 --> 01:36:00,495
Now, get your hands up.

1674
01:36:00,896 --> 01:36:02,096
No.

1675
01:36:04,736 --> 01:36:06,976
You spineless bimbo.

1676
01:36:07,615 --> 01:36:09,055
Now, out.

1677
01:36:13,495 --> 01:36:15,860
I'm going to have
to shoot you now, Archie.

1678
01:36:15,895 --> 01:36:18,295
But I've got a little time
before my plane leaves...

1679
01:36:18,330 --> 01:36:20,694
.. and I'm longing to humiliate you.

1680
01:36:20,729 --> 01:36:22,655
So get in that barrel.

1681
01:36:24,535 --> 01:36:25,460
What?

1682
01:36:25,495 --> 01:36:27,133
In the barrel.

1683
01:36:30,774 --> 01:36:32,093
Right.

1684
01:36:34,613 --> 01:36:35,538
You English!

1685
01:36:35,573 --> 01:36:38,053
You think you're so superior, don't you?

1686
01:36:38,088 --> 01:36:40,533
Well, you're the filth of the planet.

1687
01:36:40,853 --> 01:36:43,252
A bunch of pompous,...

1688
01:36:43,287 --> 01:36:45,810
.. badly-dressed, poverty-stricken,...

1689
01:36:45,845 --> 01:36:48,333
.. sexually repressed football hooligans.

1690
01:36:49,973 --> 01:36:51,378
Goodbye, Archie.

1691
01:36:51,413 --> 01:36:53,932
At least we're not irretrievably vulgar.

1692
01:36:53,967 --> 01:36:56,452
Your problem is you don't like winners.

1693
01:36:56,692 --> 01:36:58,132
- Winners?
- Yeah.

1694
01:36:58,167 --> 01:36:59,056
Winners.

1695
01:36:59,091 --> 01:37:00,291
Winners like...

1696
01:37:00,326 --> 01:37:01,492
.. North Vietnam?

1697
01:37:01,527 --> 01:37:02,891
Shut up!

1698
01:37:02,932 --> 01:37:04,852
We did not lose Vietnam!

1699
01:37:04,887 --> 01:37:05,777
It was a tie!

1700
01:37:05,812 --> 01:37:09,051
I'm telling ya, baby,
they kicked a little ass there.

1701
01:37:09,171 --> 01:37:11,811
Boy, they whupped
your hide real good!

1702
01:37:13,491 --> 01:37:14,416
No, they didn't.

1703
01:37:14,451 --> 01:37:16,851
- Oh, yes, they did.
- No, they didn't.

1704
01:37:16,886 --> 01:37:18,408
Oh, yes, they did.

1705
01:37:18,443 --> 01:37:19,931
Oh, no they...

1706
01:37:20,210 --> 01:37:21,611
Shut up!

1707
01:37:22,130 --> 01:37:23,055
Goodbye, Archie.

1708
01:37:23,090 --> 01:37:24,496
Are you gonna shoot me?

1709
01:37:24,531 --> 01:37:26,890
Er yes, I'm afraid so, old chap.

1710
01:37:26,930 --> 01:37:27,855
Sorry!

1711
01:37:27,890 --> 01:37:29,650
Look, Otto. Look.

1712
01:37:36,530 --> 01:37:37,929
Revenge.

1713
01:37:42,289 --> 01:37:43,888
It's K-K-Ken!

1714
01:37:44,209 --> 01:37:46,329
C- c-coming to k-k-kill me.

1715
01:37:46,608 --> 01:37:49,448
How are you going to c-c-catch me,
K- K-Ken?

1716
01:37:52,369 --> 01:37:53,808
Now, where was I?

1717
01:37:53,843 --> 01:37:55,248
Oh, yeah.

1718
01:37:56,688 --> 01:37:58,168
Shit! God!

1719
01:38:00,047 --> 01:38:01,968
Fucking limey cement!

1720
01:38:10,607 --> 01:38:11,532
Ken! Ken!

1721
01:38:11,567 --> 01:38:13,287
Wait, wait, Ken!

1722
01:38:13,967 --> 01:38:16,167
Kenny! May I call you Kenny?

1723
01:38:16,367 --> 01:38:17,292
Remember Wanda?

1724
01:38:17,327 --> 01:38:19,247
I got the deal of a lifetime!

1725
01:38:19,282 --> 01:38:20,686
50-50. What do you say?

1726
01:38:20,721 --> 01:38:22,326
OK, OK, 60-40.

1727
01:38:22,606 --> 01:38:24,046
That's my final offer.

1728
01:38:24,081 --> 01:38:25,446
Revenge!

1729
01:38:25,487 --> 01:38:26,686
Wait, I got an idea.

1730
01:38:26,721 --> 01:38:27,851
You take it all.

1731
01:38:27,886 --> 01:38:30,126
Here's my boarding pass. Ken!

1732
01:38:30,286 --> 01:38:32,806
I'm gonna... I'm gonna k-k-kill you.

1733
01:38:33,165 --> 01:38:34,845
OK, fine, Ken. Come at me.

1734
01:38:34,880 --> 01:38:36,491
Give me your best shot.

1735
01:38:36,526 --> 01:38:38,446
Go on, you don't have the guts.

1736
01:38:38,481 --> 01:38:39,886
Admit it.

1737
01:38:41,805 --> 01:38:43,245
OK, you have the guts.

1738
01:38:43,280 --> 01:38:44,765
Good. Wait.

1739
01:38:45,165 --> 01:38:46,484
Death!

1740
01:38:46,604 --> 01:38:49,405
All right, I'm sorry
I ate your fish, OK?!

1741
01:38:49,485 --> 01:38:50,685
I'm sorry!

1742
01:38:50,720 --> 01:38:51,850
Revenge!

1743
01:38:51,885 --> 01:38:53,824
Jesus, I said I'm sorry.

1744
01:38:53,859 --> 01:38:55,764
What the fu...? Aaagh!

1745
01:38:58,604 --> 01:39:00,004
Got him!

1746
01:39:09,643 --> 01:39:11,563
Gotcha again!

1747
01:39:11,598 --> 01:39:13,124
You bastard!

1748
01:39:13,964 --> 01:39:16,082
Hey! I've lost my stutter.

1749
01:39:17,323 --> 01:39:18,523
It's gone.

1750
01:39:18,558 --> 01:39:19,688
I can speak.

1751
01:39:19,723 --> 01:39:22,122
How much wood could
a woodchuck chuck,...

1752
01:39:22,157 --> 01:39:24,523
.. if a woodchuck could chuck wood?

1753
01:39:26,042 --> 01:39:26,962
Good afternoon, sir.

1754
01:39:26,997 --> 01:39:28,402
Boarding pass?

1755
01:39:36,082 --> 01:39:38,041
Buongiorno, signorina.

1756
01:39:46,161 --> 01:39:47,601
Now, listen. Two things.

1757
01:39:47,636 --> 01:39:48,841
One.

1758
01:39:49,041 --> 01:39:52,441
Behave yourself from now on,
or I'll break your neck, OK.

1759
01:39:54,320 --> 01:39:55,561
Two.

1760
01:39:56,241 --> 01:39:57,720
Gorbachov.

1761
01:39:58,161 --> 01:39:59,581
Glasnost.

1762
01:39:59,616 --> 01:40:01,001
Molotov.

1763
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:03,359
Blinis.

1764
01:40:04,400 --> 01:40:05,959
Er... Lenin.

1765
01:40:06,799 --> 01:40:08,559
Pushkin.

1766
01:40:08,720 --> 01:40:10,319
Chicken Kiev.

1767
01:40:10,354 --> 01:40:11,919
Good. Dostoevsky.

1768
01:40:12,559 --> 01:40:13,960
Roubles.

1769
01:40:16,399 --> 01:40:17,959
Vladivostok.

1770
01:40:22,639 --> 01:40:24,199
Assho-o-ole!
