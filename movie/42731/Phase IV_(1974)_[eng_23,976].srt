146
00:17:35,553 --> 00:17:38,555

<i>a primary power source</i>
除了没有主电源

147
00:17:38,556 --> 00:17:42,558

<i>the experiment has begun.</i>

00:19:06,139 --> 00:19:10,941
Well, I guess they're not ready
to play yet.
呃,我猜它们还没准备好要运行

151
00:19:38,169 --> 00:19:39,670

<i>an estimate?</i>
好吧,你能给我们大概时间吗?

160
00:19:59,189 --> 00:20:02,191

But we cannot command
the ants to appear.
但我们没法命令蚂蚁出现

168
00:20:23,212 --> 00:20:27,215

Now this is really interesting.
现在这真的很有趣

199
00:24:19,939 --> 00:24:25,944
You see what I do is I get to
the parameters of the problem
by breaking down the movement of
a vector of a single anthill.
你看到我所做的就是通过破坏蚁丘的
矢量运动来获取这个问题的各方面情况

201

Now, I don't know what
they're doing, I don't care,
现在,我不知道它们
在做什么,我不在乎

202
00:24:28,447 --> 00:24:32,450
I'm just breaking down
their simple basic move.

Now I take my ant signals,

209

between what they say
and what they do.

现在假设

What we're seeing and hearing
are commands
being directed
at the central mass.
我们所看到所听过的东西是
一直是核心人群所发出的命令

Stop! Cut it out!
What's the matter?

怎么回事?

218
00:25:34,010 --> 00:25:36,011
Cut it out!
快切断!

219
00:25:36,012 --> 00:25:38,513
Come back here.
回来

220
00:25:38,514 --> 00:25:43,316
Goddamn it, will you sit...

They're all over the place.

Clete, take care of the women.
Get some help.

223
00:25:53,028 --> 00:25:55,529
Now I make various adjustments,

224
00:25:55,530 --> 00:25:57,531
make up for time lag
and a couple of other things

Ha, are you ready for this?
哈,你准备好了吗?

228
00:26:04,039 --> 00:26:09,042
I come up with a positive
correlation on the order of 80%
between this little squiggle
我想到了在这些小波形曲线
之间大概有80%的正相关

230
00:26:09,043 --> 00:26:12,545
and the command we commonly
know as stop.
这些命令的停止方式
和我们平常所知道的一样

231
00:26:12,546 --> 00:26:17,050
And a positive correlation
between that little squiggle
and go.
还有那波形曲线之间的正相关和

233
00:26:17,051 --> 00:26:20,053
And that means
these little mothers
talk to each other.
这表示这帮小混蛋会互相交流

235
00:26:20,054 --> 00:26:24,557
Now I think if I-
hey, the lights.
现在,我认为如果我...
嘿,灯光

236
00:26:24,558 --> 00:26:26,558
They've got into
the generator. Don't move,
它们到发电机里去了,别动

237
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:29,561
the back up unit
cuts in automatically.
备份单元会自动切割

238
00:26:29,562 --> 00:26:34,866
I'm going to counter
with 100% yellow.
我要用100%的
黄色化学药品来反击它们

239
00:27:19,111 --> 00:27:22,613
You're letting some get away.
你要赶跑那些东西

240
00:27:22,614 --> 00:27:26,917
Maybe they've learnt something.
也许它们已经学到了些什么

241
00:29:19,026 --> 00:29:21,526
Come over here, James,
到这儿来,詹姆斯,

242
00:29:21,527 --> 00:29:26,330
this is really fascinating.
这真是迷人

243
00:29:33,539 --> 00:29:36,541
People are dead
back there.
人都死了,回来

244
00:29:36,542 --> 00:29:39,544
Yes, a tragedy.
是啊,真是个悲剧

245
00:29:39,545 --> 00:29:43,047
I don't understand it,
they accepted the order,
我不明白,它们已经接受命令了

246
00:29:43,048 --> 00:29:45,549
why should they come here?
为什么还要到这来?

247
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:49,553
Irrational behavior,
very sad.
不合理的行为,很惨烈

248
00:29:49,554 --> 00:29:53,557
Now just look at this, James.
现在来看看这个,詹姆斯

249
00:29:53,558 --> 00:29:58,562
Consider the execution
of this maneuver,
in order to explode
the generator,
考虑一下执行这个动作的目的,
为了探索发电机,

251
00:29:58,563 --> 00:30:00,564
they had to create
a living chain-
它们不得不制造一个活的...

252
00:30:00,565 --> 00:30:06,265
listen, Hubbs, those people
are dead, don't you understand?
听着,哈布斯,那些人死了,
你还不明白吗?

253
00:30:12,076 --> 00:30:17,380
People get killed sometimes.
人们有时候也会被杀

254
00:30:19,583 --> 00:30:26,387
I think this yellow
should hold it's potency
for three or four days.
我想这些黄色化学试剂
在三四天内应该能继续发挥效力

256
00:31:27,148 --> 00:31:31,451
We can
start collecting now.
我们现在能开始收集了

257
00:32:22,201 --> 00:32:25,203
Little sons of bitches.
该死的小婊子

258
00:32:25,204 --> 00:32:27,705
No, no, no.
不,不,不

259
00:32:27,706 --> 00:32:31,209
They're not individuals,
they are individual cells.
它们不是个体,它们是个体细胞

260
00:32:31,210 --> 00:32:34,212
Tiny functioning parts
of the whole.
整体中有着
微小的功能的部分

261
00:32:34,213 --> 00:32:41,218
Think of a society, james,
with perfect harmony,
perfect altruism
and self sacrifice,
想想社会,詹姆斯,和谐、
完全利他且自我牺牲、

263
00:32:41,219 --> 00:32:46,723
perfect division of labor,
organized for preordained roles.
完善的分工、注定被组织的角色

264
00:32:46,724 --> 00:32:53,230
Think of the building,
elaborate and complex structures
according to plans
that they know nothing of,
想想建筑物,那是它们所
不知道的计划中的复杂结构,

266
00:32:53,231 --> 00:32:55,732
but can execute perfectly.
但还是能够完美的执行

267
00:32:55,733 --> 00:33:04,740
Think of their ability to evolve
and adapt
in ways that are so beautiful,
想想它们发展和适应的能力,
真是美丽极了

269
00:33:04,741 --> 00:33:12,248
and still so unknown
and all contained
in one simple form.
而且还是如此的神秘,这些
全都包含在一个简单的形式内

271
00:33:12,249 --> 00:33:20,055
So defenseless in the individual,
and so powerful in the mass.
所以个体不堪一击,
总体却是如此强大

273
00:33:22,758 --> 00:33:24,759
Well...
好吧...

274
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:30,265
Let's begin with
the first behavioral series,
让我们从第一个
行为系列开始吧

275
00:33:30,266 --> 00:33:47,080
heat, cold, isolations,starvation,
slow pressure,and threat.
热,冷,隔离,绝食,
舒缓压力,还有恐吓

278
00:33:47,282 --> 00:33:51,785
Mantises prey on ants,
as you know.
螳螂捕食蚂蚁,你知道的

279
00:33:51,786 --> 00:33:54,288
Now if-
现在,如果...

280
00:33:54,289 --> 00:33:58,292
if you're still with us, James.
如果她还跟着我们,詹姆斯

281
00:33:58,293 --> 00:34:02,296
When are we gonna
get her out of here?
我们要几时把她送出去?

282
00:34:02,297 --> 00:34:04,297
That's going to be
a little difficult, I'm afraid.
恐怕那会变得有点儿困难

283
00:34:04,298 --> 00:34:08,801
Um... turn on the microphone,
please?
呃...能请你打开我的话筒吗?

284
00:34:08,802 --> 00:34:11,804
Call in and have them send out
a helicopter.
叫他们派一架直升机过来

285
00:34:11,805 --> 00:34:21,613
I'm afraid the bureaucrats
will be rather unhappy
with all of our casualties.
恐怕官僚主义者们会对我们的
伤亡人数感到很不满意

287
00:34:23,317 --> 00:34:25,318

I will.
你不呼叫基地的话,那我来

You've been bitten.

这是种相当粗俗的语言,

Strike up a conversation
with them.

pretty good myself.
听着,换作我是你,

the hardware department.

Really?
It must be interesting.

373

Well, we've got powdered eggs,

Good morningJames.

we're under siege.

It's more than
reflected sunlight.

Our temperature is already up
five degrees.

已经升了5华氏度了

384

interesting detail.
那又是个有趣的细节

385

How do you suppose those ants
managed to build
on a poisonous strip where they
absolutely cannot live?
你对那些蚂蚁建立于它们完全
无法生存的地方有什么看法?

387
00:45:13,738 --> 00:45:15,239
Did you say five degrees?
Hmm.

In an hour and a half.
在一个半小时内

389
00:45:16,741 --> 00:45:19,743
And of course the sun's
not yet at full strength.
当然阳光还没足够强

390
00:45:19,744 --> 00:45:23,246
Now watch this.
An hour and a half?
-现在来看看这个
-这也是在一个半钟头内?

391
00:45:23,247 --> 00:45:28,251
Oh, you must watch this,
this is fascinating, there.
哦,你一定要看看这个,
非常迷人,这里

392

Beautiful adaptation,
isn't it?

393
00:45:30,754 --> 00:45:32,755
We challenge with
yellow chemistry,
我们用
黄色的化学试剂挑衅它们,

they respond with

We're gonna fry in here.

Question,
what do they want?

Well, you saw how
they disabled the truck.
好吧,你看到了它们
是怎么把卡车给废了的

399
00:45:48,271 --> 00:45:52,774
Listen, Hubbs,
I came down here
to get in a couple of weeks
of science in the sun,
听着,哈布斯,我来这里是为了
在太阳底下进行两周的实验

401
00:45:52,775 --> 00:45:55,778
I did not sign up for a war
against a bunch of goddamn ants.
我不是为了和一堆该死的蚂蚁开战

402
00:45:55,779 --> 00:46:01,284
And furthermore, why the hell
did you leave the truck
out there in the first place?
此外,你当初为什么他妈的
把卡车留在了外面?

404
00:46:01,285 --> 00:46:03,286
Bait.
那是诱饵

405
00:46:03,287 --> 00:46:04,786
Bait?
诱饵?

406
00:46:04,787 --> 00:46:06,788
Well, I had to get them
to attack us, didn't I?
是的,我必须让它们攻击我们,不是吗?

407
00:46:06,789 --> 00:46:08,790
They're rather intelligent,
you know.
它们极其聪明,你知道的

408
00:46:08,791 --> 00:46:13,795
I thought you'd observed that
geometric pattern in the field?
我以为你会研究
田地上的几何图形

409
00:46:13,796 --> 00:46:14,796
You mean you saw it?
你是说你看到了?

410
00:46:14,797 --> 00:46:17,799
Of course I did.
当然了

411
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:20,302
Why didn't you say something?
Why didn't you?
你为什么什么也不说?为什么?

412
00:46:20,303 --> 00:46:23,305
Well, I didn't think you were
smart enough to appreciate it.
我不认为你会够聪明地来欣赏它们

413
00:46:23,306 --> 00:46:26,307
With all your high class
bug talk.
你那些高级的错误的谈话

414
00:46:26,308 --> 00:46:31,312
I was afraid that
you'd be terrified and run away,
我怕你会害怕然后跑开,

415
00:46:31,313 --> 00:46:32,813
and I need you.
但我需要你

416
00:46:32,814 --> 00:46:37,818
Well, you're right about that.
When's the helicopter coming?
好吧,你是对的,
直升机要什么时候到?

417
00:46:37,819 --> 00:46:43,824
James,
we are faced with a power
that has appeared
and is exerting itself.
詹姆斯,我们面对着一种
已出现并正在发挥作用的力量

419
00:46:43,825 --> 00:46:49,329
We have the opportunity
to study it,
to learn from it, to teach it
its limitations.
我们有机会来学习,学习它,
教它们什么是它们的极限

421
00:46:49,330 --> 00:46:52,832
We can, in a word,
educate it.
我们能,就是说,教育它

422
00:46:52,833 --> 00:46:55,835
You said you called.
你说过你呼叫了

423
00:46:55,836 --> 00:46:58,838
We can try the blue, of course,
but they'd only readapt again.
我们可以郁闷,当然可以,
但它们会再次适应的

424
00:46:58,839 --> 00:47:01,841
So we have to consider
other alternatives.
因此我们得确认其他的选择

425
00:47:01,842 --> 00:47:04,344
You mean you didn't call?
你是说你没呼叫?

426
00:47:04,345 --> 00:47:10,349
It is absolutely vital that
we give them the opportunity
