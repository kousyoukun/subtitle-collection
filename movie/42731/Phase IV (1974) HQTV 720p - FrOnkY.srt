<i>the final effect would be.</i>

<i>Astronomers argued over theory</i>

4

6

<i>Mystics predicted earthquakes</i>

7
00:01:04,504 --> 00:01:09,808

<i>as we knew it.</i>

8
00:01:34,533 --> 00:01:36,534
<i>When the effect came</i>

9
00:01:36,535 --> 00:01:40,037
<i>it was almost unnoticed</i>

10
00:01:40,038 --> 00:01:42,039
<i>because it happened</i>
<i>to such a small</i>

11

<i>and insignificant form of life.</i>

<i>an English man, Ernest Hubbs</i>

13

<i>Ordinary ants</i>
<i>of different species</i>

17

<i>By summer the rest of the world</i>
<i>had moved on to other things</i>

21

You did your major work

applying game theory to
the language of killer whales.

68

Well, it seemed cheaper
than applying it to real air.

69
00:11:18,191 --> 00:11:21,193
Did you actually succeed
in making positive contact

71

Only with
the emotionally disturbed.

Look, I'm sorry, I'm strictly
a pencil and paper guy

76
00:11:36,708 --> 00:11:37,708
I wouldn't know the front end

00:11:37,709 --> 00:11:42,012
from...
A hole in the ground.

I know that game's
your business, James,

you play them very well.
That's why you're here.

80

88
00:14:01,848 --> 00:14:03,349
There are certain
equatorial ants

89
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:05,350
that would attack anything -
insects, mammals -

90
00:14:05,351 --> 00:14:10,655
anything at all that threatens
their food supply.

91
00:14:10,856 --> 00:14:13,858
The smell
triggers their behavior.

92
00:14:13,859 --> 00:14:17,161
Yeah.

93
00:14:17,363 --> 00:14:22,166
They are picky eaters.

94
00:14:37,081 --> 00:14:39,082
Now this thing here.

95
00:14:39,083 --> 00:14:41,084
You see what we're doing,

96
00:14:41,085 --> 00:14:44,087
we're running lines
from these fuel tanks

97
00:14:44,088 --> 00:14:47,090
and if those ants get over
that water trap

98
00:14:47,091 --> 00:14:49,592
we're gonna set fire
to this here ditch

99
00:14:49,593 --> 00:14:53,395
and watch 'em all burn.

100
00:14:53,597 --> 00:14:57,099
What do you think?

101
00:14:57,100 --> 00:15:00,902
Done a lot of good work.

102
00:15:06,109 --> 00:15:10,111
I'd say they started pulling out
three, four weeks ago

103
00:15:10,112 --> 00:15:13,114
a couple of families at a time.

104
00:15:13,115 --> 00:15:14,616
What else?

105
00:15:14,617 --> 00:15:16,618
That's about the size of it.

106
00:15:16,619 --> 00:15:19,621
I guess it must have been
some kind of infestation

107
00:15:19,622 --> 00:15:21,623
but... Well, I couldn't say
for sure.

108
00:15:21,624 --> 00:15:24,626
Maybe the heat
got too much for 'em.

109
00:15:24,627 --> 00:15:26,127
There's a collapsed house
down there.

110
00:15:26,128 --> 00:15:28,630
Well, I wouldn't know
about that.

111
00:15:28,631 --> 00:15:30,131
I didn't really get to know
those people

112
00:15:30,132 --> 00:15:33,634
they were...
They were city folk mainly.

113
00:15:33,635 --> 00:15:36,136
Tell me about the towers.

114
00:15:36,137 --> 00:15:39,139
Don't know,
wasn't there.

115
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:41,642
Of course
it's been a dry year.

116
00:15:41,643 --> 00:15:43,644
You know we do get ants
in dry years.

117
00:15:43,645 --> 00:15:44,645
Hmm.

118
00:15:44,646 --> 00:15:46,647
I talked to an entomologist

119
00:15:46,648 --> 00:15:49,149
up at the state department
of agriculture at one time,

120
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:52,152
he said these things
were cyclical.

121
00:15:52,153 --> 00:15:55,655
They weren't talking about
those ants.

122
00:15:55,656 --> 00:15:58,157
Mildred, come on out here.

123
00:15:58,158 --> 00:16:00,159
That's alright.
It isn't alright.

124
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,160
These people will think

125
00:16:01,161 --> 00:16:05,464
I've got you chained up
in there.

126
00:16:06,667 --> 00:16:09,168
These gentlemen are from
the university,

127
00:16:09,169 --> 00:16:12,171
they're gonna develop
a new spray for those ants.

128
00:16:12,172 --> 00:16:13,673
You know what I think.

129
00:16:13,674 --> 00:16:16,675
Ha! You know if she didn't have
something to worry about,

130
00:16:16,676 --> 00:16:18,677
she wouldn't know what to do
with herself.

131
00:16:18,678 --> 00:16:21,179
I'm afraid you're gonna have to
leave for a few days

132
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:25,483

It's for your own protection.

136
00:16:34,694 --> 00:16:39,697
Evacuation?
What's this all about anyway?

137
00:16:39,698 --> 00:16:41,699
Why this isn't right.
They can't just push us off-

138

00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:51,682
<i>before the fiscal period ends</i>
<i>on the 14th.</i>

157
00:19:51,683 --> 00:19:54,684
<i>Shall we put you down</i>
<i>for one more week?</i>

158
00:19:54,685 --> 00:19:57,687
I'm sorry,
this is not a precise business.

159
00:19:57,688 --> 00:19:59,188
<i>Well, can you give us</i>
<i>an estimate?</i>

160
00:19:59,189 --> 00:20:02,191
We cannot study the ants
until they make an appearance.

161
00:20:02,192 --> 00:20:04,694
<i>Can we put you down</i>
<i>for ten more days?</i>

162
00:20:04,695 --> 00:20:07,697
This is not
a controlled experiment,

163
00:20:07,698 --> 00:20:11,200
in our judgment another
occurrence in this area

164
00:20:11,201 --> 00:20:12,702
is highly probable.

165
00:20:12,703 --> 00:20:15,203
But we cannot command
the ants to appear.

166
00:20:15,204 --> 00:20:19,207
<i>Well is there something</i>
<i>you could do to hurry them up?</i>

167
00:20:19,208 --> 00:20:23,211
We have been thinking
about that.

168
00:20:23,212 --> 00:20:24,212
<i>You know, of course,</i>
<i>there is concern</i>

169
00:20:24,213 --> 00:20:27,215
<i>over possible outbreaks</i>
<i>in other areas?</i>

170
00:20:27,216 --> 00:20:29,217
Ah, I share that concern.

171
00:20:29,218 --> 00:20:33,221
My associate, Mr. Lesko,
has something to say.

172
00:20:33,222 --> 00:20:34,723
Listen, I want you
to do me a favor -

173
00:20:34,724 --> 00:20:38,225
I want you to call Miss Dobson,
d-o-b-s-o-n.

174
00:20:38,226 --> 00:20:42,229
6-6-2-0-7-9-9 in Los Angeles.

175
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:46,734
Tell her not to take
the plane to Vegas on thursday.

176
00:20:46,735 --> 00:20:48,235
Tell her it'll be
a couple more weeks and...

177
00:20:48,236 --> 00:20:50,237
She'll hear from me, okay?

178
00:20:50,238 --> 00:20:51,739
<i>Did you say</i>
<i>a couple of weeks?</i>

179
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:53,240
That's right.

180
00:20:53,241 --> 00:20:55,743
<i>Mr. Lesko, that's not</i>
<i>going to be possible,</i>

181
00:20:55,744 --> 00:21:00,546
<i>accord-</i>

182
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:38,083
let's see some activity.

183
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:09,612
Hi, there?

184
00:23:00,864 --> 00:23:02,865
Clete!

185
00:23:02,866 --> 00:23:04,366
Ants.

186
00:23:04,367 --> 00:23:07,369
They got the horse,
clete, light the fire.

187
00:23:07,370 --> 00:23:12,673
Kendra. Oh, my god.

188
00:23:12,875 --> 00:23:18,179
Grandpa,
can't you something?

189
00:23:21,383 --> 00:23:24,385
Oh, my god.

190
00:23:24,386 --> 00:23:26,888
Clete, get over here.

191
00:23:26,889 --> 00:23:29,390
Can't you do something?

192
00:23:29,391 --> 00:23:32,692
Give me the gun.

193
00:23:33,895 --> 00:23:36,396
No, no, no.
Let me go.

194
00:23:36,397 --> 00:23:39,900
Clete, get her in the house,
get her in the house.

195
00:23:39,901 --> 00:23:45,601
Don't kill him.

196
00:24:09,930 --> 00:24:11,931
All set?

197
00:24:11,932 --> 00:24:17,235
Keep down now.
That's right. Hang on.

198
00:24:18,437 --> 00:24:19,938
Now this is really interesting.

199
00:24:19,939 --> 00:24:21,940
You see what I do is I get to
the parameters of the problem

200
00:24:21,941 --> 00:24:25,944
by breaking down the movement of
a vector of a single anthill.

201
00:24:25,945 --> 00:24:28,446
Now, I don't know what
they're doing, I don't care,

202
00:24:28,447 --> 00:24:32,450
I'm just breaking down
their simple basic move.

203
00:24:32,451 --> 00:24:36,754
Stop, go.

204
00:24:38,456 --> 00:24:41,458
Turn,

205
00:24:41,459 --> 00:24:44,962
duration.
That's it period, okay?

206
00:24:44,963 --> 00:24:46,463
Now I take my ant signals,

207
00:24:46,464 --> 00:24:47,965
I run them through
the digitizer,

208
00:24:47,966 --> 00:24:49,466
I record them on tape,

209
00:24:49,467 --> 00:24:51,969
I write them down and
I search for a correlation

210
00:24:51,970 --> 00:24:54,972
between what they say
and what they do.

211
00:24:54,973 --> 00:24:56,473
Now assumption.

212
00:24:56,474 --> 00:24:59,475
What we're seeing and hearing
are commands

213
00:24:59,476 --> 00:25:02,277
being directed
at the central mass.

214
00:25:06,984 --> 00:25:09,986
They warned us.

215
00:25:09,987 --> 00:25:13,789
Relax.

216
00:25:19,997 --> 00:25:25,300
I forgot to turn out the light.

217
00:25:30,006 --> 00:25:34,009
Stop! Cut it out!
What's the matter?

218
00:25:34,010 --> 00:25:36,011
Cut it out!

219
00:25:36,012 --> 00:25:38,513
Come back here.

220
00:25:38,514 --> 00:25:43,316
Goddamn it, will you sit...

221
00:25:46,521 --> 00:25:50,524
They're all over the place.

222
00:25:50,525 --> 00:25:53,027
Clete, take care of the women.
Get some help.

223
00:25:53,028 --> 00:25:55,529
Now I make various adjustments,

224
00:25:55,530 --> 00:25:57,531
make up for time lag
and a couple of other things

225
00:25:57,532 --> 00:25:59,033
don't worry about it.

226
00:25:59,034 --> 00:26:01,535
Then I come up with...

227
00:26:01,536 --> 00:26:04,038
Ha, are you ready for this?

228
00:26:04,039 --> 00:26:07,540
I come up with a positive
correlation on the order of 80%

229
00:26:07,541 --> 00:26:09,042
between this little squiggle

230
00:26:09,043 --> 00:26:12,545
and the command we commonly
know as stop.

231
00:26:12,546 --> 00:26:15,548
And a positive correlation
between that little squiggle

232
00:26:15,549 --> 00:26:17,050
and go.

233
00:26:17,051 --> 00:26:18,551
And that means
these little mothers

234
00:26:18,552 --> 00:26:20,053
talk to each other.

235
00:26:20,054 --> 00:26:24,557
Now I think if I-
hey, the lights.

236
00:26:24,558 --> 00:26:26,558
They've got into
the generator. Don't move,

237
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:29,561
the back up unit
cuts in automatically.

238
00:26:29,562 --> 00:26:34,866
I'm going to counter
with 100% yellow.

239
00:27:19,111 --> 00:27:22,613
You're letting some get away.

240
00:27:22,614 --> 00:27:26,917
Maybe they've learnt something.

241
00:29:19,026 --> 00:29:21,526
Come over here, James,

242
00:29:21,527 --> 00:29:26,330
this is really fascinating.

243
00:29:33,539 --> 00:29:36,541
People are dead
back there.

244
00:29:36,542 --> 00:29:39,544
Yes, a tragedy.

245
00:29:39,545 --> 00:29:43,047
I don't understand it,
they accepted the order,

246
00:29:43,048 --> 00:29:45,549
why should they come here?

247
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:49,553
Irrational behavior,
very sad.

248
00:29:49,554 --> 00:29:53,557
Now just look at this, James.

249
00:29:53,558 --> 00:29:56,560
Consider the execution
of this maneuver,

250
00:29:56,561 --> 00:29:58,562
in order to explode
the generator,

251
00:29:58,563 --> 00:30:00,564
they had to create
a living chain-

252
00:30:00,565 --> 00:30:06,265
listen, Hubbs, those people
are dead, don't you understand?

253
00:30:12,076 --> 00:30:17,380
People get killed sometimes.

254
00:30:19,583 --> 00:30:22,585
I think this yellow
should hold it's potency

255
00:30:22,586 --> 00:30:26,387
for three or four days.

256
00:31:27,148 --> 00:31:31,451
We can
start collecting now.

257
00:32:22,201 --> 00:32:25,203
Little sons of bitches.

258
00:32:25,204 --> 00:32:27,705
No, no, no.

259
00:32:27,706 --> 00:32:31,209
They're not individuals,
they are individual cells.

260
00:32:31,210 --> 00:32:34,212
Tiny functioning parts
of the whole.

261
00:32:34,213 --> 00:32:38,215
Think of a society, james,
with perfect harmony,

262
00:32:38,216 --> 00:32:41,218
perfect altruism
and self sacrifice,

263
00:32:41,219 --> 00:32:46,723
perfect division of labor,
organized for preordained roles.

264
00:32:46,724 --> 00:32:50,727
Think of the building,
elaborate and complex structures

265
00:32:50,728 --> 00:32:53,230
according to plans
that they know nothing of,

266
00:32:53,231 --> 00:32:55,732
but can execute perfectly.

267
00:32:55,733 --> 00:33:01,237
Think of their ability to evolve
and adapt

268
00:33:01,238 --> 00:33:04,740
in ways that are so beautiful,

269
00:33:04,741 --> 00:33:06,742
and still so unknown

270
00:33:06,743 --> 00:33:12,248
and all contained
in one simple form.

271
00:33:12,249 --> 00:33:16,252
So defenseless
in the individual,

272
00:33:16,253 --> 00:33:20,055
and so powerful in the mass.

273
00:33:22,758 --> 00:33:24,759
Well...

274
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:30,265
Let's begin with
the first behavioral series,

275
00:33:30,266 --> 00:33:35,966
heat, cold, isolations,
starvation,

276
00:33:37,273 --> 00:33:40,575
slow pressure,

277
00:33:43,778 --> 00:33:47,080
and threat.

278
00:33:47,282 --> 00:33:51,785
Mantises prey on ants,
as you know.

279
00:33:51,786 --> 00:33:54,288
Now if-

280
00:33:54,289 --> 00:33:58,292
if you're still with us, James.

281
00:33:58,293 --> 00:34:02,296
When are we gonna
get her out of here?

282
00:34:02,297 --> 00:34:04,297
That's going to be
a little difficult, I'm afraid.

283
00:34:04,298 --> 00:34:08,801
Um... turn on the microphone,
please?

284
00:34:08,802 --> 00:34:11,804
Call in and have them send out
a helicopter.

285
00:34:11,805 --> 00:34:17,505
I'm afraid the bureaucrats
will be rather unhappy

286
00:34:17,811 --> 00:34:21,613
with all of our casualties.

287
00:34:23,317 --> 00:34:25,318
Now...

288
00:34:25,319 --> 00:34:28,820
Mantises,
at this end of the maze,

289
00:34:28,821 --> 00:34:30,322
the ants are at the other.

290
00:34:30,323 --> 00:34:33,825
What are we gonna do
with the girl?

291
00:34:33,826 --> 00:34:35,827
What is your concern with her?

292
00:34:35,828 --> 00:34:39,331
She's in shock,
we can't just... she's a kid.

293
00:34:39,332 --> 00:34:42,834
Don't shout.

294
00:34:42,835 --> 00:34:45,837
This is a problem that
will have to be dealt with

295
00:34:45,838 --> 00:34:50,341
over the next few days
until we're finished.

296
00:34:50,342 --> 00:34:52,843
If you won't call the base,
I will.

297
00:34:52,844 --> 00:34:55,346
I'm very much afraid that that
will end our mission.

298
00:34:55,347 --> 00:34:58,649
Screw our mission.

299
00:35:00,852 --> 00:35:02,853
I've finished eating.

300
00:35:02,854 --> 00:35:05,856
You know,
I don't know your name.

301
00:35:05,857 --> 00:35:07,858
Oh, Kendra.
I'm Jim.

302
00:35:07,859 --> 00:35:09,859
That's Dr. Hubbs.

303
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:12,362
Come in, come on.

304
00:35:12,363 --> 00:35:14,364
You sort of had a close call
out there, didn't you?

305
00:35:14,365 --> 00:35:19,369
How do you feel?
Well, I'm ready to go home now.

306
00:35:19,370 --> 00:35:20,870
Um... I'll send
a message today.

307
00:35:20,871 --> 00:35:23,873
Somebody will come along
and pick you up tomorrow,

308
00:35:23,874 --> 00:35:27,176
if that's convenient.

309
00:35:33,383 --> 00:35:36,885
They killed my horse.

310
00:35:36,886 --> 00:35:40,389
Kendra, I'm sorry.

311
00:35:40,390 --> 00:35:41,890
Kendra!

312
00:35:41,891 --> 00:35:43,392
Stop it, stop it.

313
00:35:43,393 --> 00:35:44,393
Back away.

314
00:35:44,394 --> 00:35:46,395
Don't touch anything.

315
00:35:46,396 --> 00:35:49,698
It's alright.

316
00:35:57,906 --> 00:36:00,908
That should do it.

317
00:36:00,909 --> 00:36:03,710
You've been bitten.

318
00:37:52,917 --> 00:37:55,418
<i>So we thought if you</i>
<i>knocked down one of the towers,</i>

319
00:37:55,419 --> 00:37:57,921
<i>taking proper precautions</i>
<i>of course,</i>

320
00:37:57,922 --> 00:38:00,924
<i>you might get</i>
<i>an interesting reaction.</i>

321
00:38:00,925 --> 00:38:02,425
We'll consider it.

322
00:38:02,426 --> 00:38:04,927
<i>Just an idea doctor.</i>
Appreciated.

323
00:38:04,928 --> 00:38:08,430
<i>Oh, one other thing.</i>
Yes?

324
00:38:08,431 --> 00:38:11,433
<i>We got a report about a family</i>
<i>in your vicinity;</i>

325
00:38:11,434 --> 00:38:16,237
<i>you haven't contacted</i>
<i>any civilians, have you?</i>

326
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:19,241
No.

327
00:39:42,521 --> 00:39:45,523
<i>Monday, 2:00 a. m.</i>

328
00:39:45,524 --> 00:39:49,027
<i>Lesko continues</i>
<i>to make progress,</i>

329
00:39:49,028 --> 00:39:51,529
<i>deciphering the ant language</i>

330
00:39:51,530 --> 00:39:56,033
<i>from the tapes recorded</i>
<i>during the first skirmish.</i>

331
00:39:56,034 --> 00:39:59,036
<i>If he maintains this pace,</i>

332
00:39:59,037 --> 00:40:02,839
<i>we should be ready</i>
<i>for their next move.</i>

333
00:40:14,052 --> 00:40:18,054
It's a rather crude language,

334
00:40:18,055 --> 00:40:20,056
I think if I keep building up
my library of sound words

335
00:40:20,057 --> 00:40:22,058
I might even...

336
00:40:22,059 --> 00:40:25,861
Strike up a conversation
with them.

337
00:40:26,563 --> 00:40:30,066
Of course then the ants
would have to come back.

338
00:40:30,067 --> 00:40:33,569
We'd have to be here
for a while.

339
00:40:33,570 --> 00:40:35,071
When's the helicopter coming?

340
00:40:35,072 --> 00:40:38,073
Oh, it'll be here.

341
00:40:38,074 --> 00:40:43,378
I'm sorry about that.
Oh, not your fault.

342
00:40:44,580 --> 00:40:47,082
Listen, you really wanna see
something?

343
00:40:47,083 --> 00:40:49,584
Another way of visualizing
their signals.

344
00:40:49,585 --> 00:40:52,887
Watch this.

345
00:41:03,098 --> 00:41:08,402
I don't have the faintest idea
what it means.

346
00:42:48,599 --> 00:42:50,600
Hey?

347
00:42:50,601 --> 00:42:52,602
Remember me?

348
00:42:52,603 --> 00:42:54,104
Oh, y-y-yeah!

349
00:42:54,105 --> 00:42:56,606
How do you feel?

350
00:42:56,607 --> 00:43:01,111
Oh... Better.
That's good.

351
00:43:01,112 --> 00:43:02,112
H- h-how is um...

352
00:43:02,113 --> 00:43:03,613
dr. hubbs?
Yeah.

353
00:43:03,614 --> 00:43:07,617
Oh, he'll survive.

354
00:43:07,618 --> 00:43:09,119
I'm really sorry about that I...

355
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:11,120
Listen, if I were you
I'd have popped those ants

356
00:43:11,121 --> 00:43:12,621
pretty good myself.

357
00:43:12,622 --> 00:43:16,625
You know
you've got a mean swing.

358
00:43:16,626 --> 00:43:19,628
Well, the main thing is
you're alright.

359
00:43:19,629 --> 00:43:23,932
We'll get you out of here today.

360
00:43:24,134 --> 00:43:25,634
What's the matter?

361
00:43:25,635 --> 00:43:29,938
Don't tell me
you like this place?

362
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:36,144
My grandparents are dead,
aren't they?

363
00:43:36,145 --> 00:43:39,447
Yeah, they are.

364
00:43:40,149 --> 00:43:44,452
What?
Don't you have parents?

365
00:43:45,154 --> 00:43:47,155
Well, you must be hungry.

366
00:43:47,156 --> 00:43:51,659
Come on,
I'll get you some breakfast.

367
00:43:51,660 --> 00:43:53,161
Okay.

368
00:43:53,162 --> 00:43:57,464
Follow me through
the hardware department.

369
00:44:05,673 --> 00:44:10,177
Can I ask you a question?
Yeah, sure, go ahead.

370
00:44:10,178 --> 00:44:13,180
What do you do here?

371
00:44:13,181 --> 00:44:18,184
Just a little research into
statistical probabilities.

372
00:44:18,185 --> 00:44:22,988
Really?
It must be interesting.

373
00:44:25,692 --> 00:44:28,694
Well, we've got powdered eggs,
powdered milk,

374
00:44:28,695 --> 00:44:32,698
powdered juice,
dehydrated bacon,

375
00:44:32,699 --> 00:44:35,701
just like home.

376
00:44:35,702 --> 00:44:37,202
James?

377
00:44:37,203 --> 00:44:39,204
Are you alright?
Oh, yeah.

378
00:44:39,205 --> 00:44:43,508
See you in a little while.
Okay.

379
00:44:51,717 --> 00:44:54,719
Good morningJames.

380
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:58,223
As you can see
we're under siege.

381
00:44:58,224 --> 00:44:59,723
What the hell's that?

382
00:44:59,724 --> 00:45:01,225
It's more than
reflected sunlight.

383
00:45:01,226 --> 00:45:03,227
Our temperature is already up
five degrees.

384
00:45:03,228 --> 00:45:05,729
There's another
interesting detail.

385
00:45:05,730 --> 00:45:09,233
How do you suppose those ants
managed to build

386
00:45:09,234 --> 00:45:13,737
on a poisonous strip where they
absolutely cannot live?

387
00:45:13,738 --> 00:45:15,239
Did you say five degrees?
Hmm.

388
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:16,740
In an hour and a half.

389
00:45:16,741 --> 00:45:19,743
And of course the sun's
not yet at full strength.

390
00:45:19,744 --> 00:45:23,246
Now watch this.
An hour and a half?

391
00:45:23,247 --> 00:45:28,251
Oh, you must watch this,
this is fascinating, there.

392
00:45:28,252 --> 00:45:30,753
Beautiful adaptation,
isn't it?

393
00:45:30,754 --> 00:45:32,755
We challenge with
yellow chemistry,

394
00:45:32,756 --> 00:45:34,757
they respond with
yellow creatures.

395
00:45:34,758 --> 00:45:36,759
We're gonna fry in here.

396
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:41,063
Question,
what do they want?

397
00:45:41,265 --> 00:45:44,266
What are their goals?
They have no goals.

398
00:45:44,267 --> 00:45:48,270
Well, you saw how
they disabled the truck.

399
00:45:48,271 --> 00:45:49,771
Listen, Hubbs,
I came down here

400
00:45:49,772 --> 00:45:52,774
to get in a couple of weeks
of science in the sun,

401
00:45:52,775 --> 00:45:55,778
I did not sign up for a war
against a bunch of goddamn ants.

402
00:45:55,779 --> 00:45:57,280
And furthermore, why the hell

403
00:45:57,281 --> 00:46:01,284
did you leave the truck
out there in the first place?

404
00:46:01,285 --> 00:46:03,286
Bait.

405
00:46:03,287 --> 00:46:04,786
Bait?

406
00:46:04,787 --> 00:46:06,788
Well, I had to get them
to attack us, didn't I?

407
00:46:06,789 --> 00:46:08,790
They're rather intelligent,
you know.

408
00:46:08,791 --> 00:46:13,795
I thought you'd observed that
geometric pattern in the field?

409
00:46:13,796 --> 00:46:14,796
You mean you saw it?

410
00:46:14,797 --> 00:46:17,799
Of course I did.

411
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:20,302
Why didn't you say something?
Why didn't you?

412
00:46:20,303 --> 00:46:23,305
Well, I didn't think you were
smart enough to appreciate it.

413
00:46:23,306 --> 00:46:26,307
With all your high class
bug talk.

414
00:46:26,308 --> 00:46:31,312
I was afraid that
you'd be terrified and run away,

415
00:46:31,313 --> 00:46:32,813
and I need you.

416
00:46:32,814 --> 00:46:37,818
Well, you're right about that.
When's the helicopter coming?

417
00:46:37,819 --> 00:46:41,822
James,
we are faced with a power

418
00:46:41,823 --> 00:46:43,824
that has appeared
and is exerting itself.

419
00:46:43,825 --> 00:46:46,327
We have the opportunity
to study it,

420
00:46:46,328 --> 00:46:49,329
to learn from it, to teach it
its limitations.

421
00:46:49,330 --> 00:46:52,832
We can, in a word,
educate it.

422
00:46:52,833 --> 00:46:55,835
You said you called.

423
00:46:55,836 --> 00:46:58,838
We can try the blue, of course,
but they'd only readapt again.

424
00:46:58,839 --> 00:47:01,841
So we have to consider
other alternatives.

425
00:47:01,842 --> 00:47:04,344
You mean you didn't call?

426
00:47:04,345 --> 00:47:07,847
It is absolutely vital that
we give them the opportunity

427
00:47:07,848 --> 00:47:10,349
to try their strength
against ours,

428
00:47:10,350 --> 00:47:12,351
and learn from its consequences.

429
00:47:12,352 --> 00:47:14,353
I'm gonna call in, hubbs.

430
00:47:14,354 --> 00:47:16,855
And I'm gonna tell them not only
to take that girl out of here,

431
00:47:16,856 --> 00:47:21,860
I'm gonna tell them to take me
out of here too.

432
00:47:21,861 --> 00:47:23,362
You wanna call?

433
00:47:23,363 --> 00:47:27,866
You're just as fascinated
by this challenge as I am.

434
00:47:27,867 --> 00:47:30,668
Ah!

435
00:47:32,871 --> 00:47:34,872
We're cut off.

436
00:47:34,873 --> 00:47:39,676
Then our success
will be all the sweeter.

437
00:47:51,990 --> 00:47:53,490
<i>Sunday, one o'clock,</i>

438
00:47:53,491 --> 00:47:55,992
<i>the battle is on,</i>

439
00:47:55,993 --> 00:47:57,994
<i>lesko is preparing</i>
<i>the counteraction</i>

440
00:47:57,995 --> 00:47:59,996
<i>I have indicated.</i>

441
00:47:59,997 --> 00:48:02,499
<i>The air conditioner</i>
<i>is being adjusted</i>

442
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:06,503
<i>to take account</i>
<i>of the temperature rise.</i>

443
00:48:06,504 --> 00:48:10,006
<i>Human beings can exist</i>
<i>in temperatures of 120 degrees</i>

444
00:48:10,007 --> 00:48:11,508
<i>or higher.</i>

445
00:48:11,509 --> 00:48:16,311
<i>But our computer shuts down</i>
<i>at 90.</i>

446
00:48:21,518 --> 00:48:24,820
Kendra?

447
00:48:25,021 --> 00:48:28,823
You wanna see
what we're doing?

448
00:48:30,026 --> 00:48:33,828
Come on, I'll show you,
it's interesting.

449
00:48:37,032 --> 00:48:39,534
The name of the game today
is king of the hill.

450
00:48:39,535 --> 00:48:43,037
You see over there?

451
00:48:43,038 --> 00:48:48,342
Now we wanna knock them down
before they burn us out, okay?

452
00:49:38,091 --> 00:49:40,092
What's that?

453
00:49:40,093 --> 00:49:41,594
White sound.

454
00:49:41,595 --> 00:49:43,094
That's every sound in the world
all pushed together

455
00:49:43,095 --> 00:49:45,096
to make one really
terrific noise

456
00:49:45,097 --> 00:49:48,899
which we're broadcasting
to those mounds out there.

457
00:49:52,104 --> 00:49:54,606
And that's what it looks like
as we send it out.

458
00:49:54,607 --> 00:49:57,609
Okay?

459
00:49:57,610 --> 00:49:59,611
Now when that sound
gets out to those mounds,

460
00:49:59,612 --> 00:50:05,312
it bounces right back here
and winds up down there.

461
00:50:05,617 --> 00:50:08,118
Good.
Something's missing.

462
00:50:08,119 --> 00:50:12,623
One of the sounds we sent out
didn't come back.

463
00:50:12,624 --> 00:50:18,324
Now let's just see if we can
find out what that sound is.

464
00:50:24,135 --> 00:50:26,135
There it is.

465
00:50:26,136 --> 00:50:29,639
Now that's the sound we're gonna
broadcast to those mounds.

466
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:34,443
And when we do, interesting
things better happen.

467
00:50:37,908 --> 00:50:39,148
If you think that's loud for us

468
00:50:39,149 --> 00:50:43,453
think about how those ants
are gonna feel.

469
00:50:50,661 --> 00:50:53,963
That'll do it.

470
00:51:38,707 --> 00:51:41,508
They're going crazy.

471
00:53:49,832 --> 00:53:54,335
James?

472
00:53:54,336 --> 00:53:58,138
Damn air conditioner.

473
00:53:58,340 --> 00:54:02,643
I'm afraid I'm feeling rather-
ow!

474
00:54:06,147 --> 00:54:07,347
It's on fire.
Get away from it.

475
00:54:07,348 --> 00:54:11,150
Get out of the way.

476
00:55:47,445 --> 00:55:51,448
I just... I can't believe it.

477
00:55:51,449 --> 00:55:52,950
To know our plans,

478
00:55:52,951 --> 00:55:54,450
our strength,
our weaknesses.

479
00:55:54,451 --> 00:55:59,956
Even the one machine
that everything else depends on.

480
00:55:59,957 --> 00:56:02,458
How could they know?

481
00:56:02,459 --> 00:56:05,962
This is impossible.

482
00:56:05,963 --> 00:56:08,764
They knew.

483
00:58:26,596 --> 00:58:30,599
<i>I am choosing one of</i>
<i>my less painful moments</i>

484
00:58:30,600 --> 00:58:34,402
<i>to record these notes.</i>

485
00:58:36,106 --> 00:58:40,609
<i>Our equipment</i>
<i>only functions now</i>

486
00:58:40,610 --> 00:58:43,612
<i>for a few hours at night.</i>

487
00:58:43,613 --> 00:58:47,116
<i>Lesko believes</i>
<i>we're being allowed this time</i>

488
00:58:47,117 --> 00:58:49,117
<i>for some purpose.</i>

489
00:58:49,118 --> 00:58:53,121
<i>A hypothesis, I do not share.</i>

490
00:58:53,122 --> 00:58:55,623
<i>If this were so</i>

491
00:58:55,624 --> 00:58:58,626
<i>it would raise questions</i>

492
00:58:58,627 --> 00:59:02,429
<i>I had not considered.</i>

493
00:59:04,133 --> 00:59:09,636
"Transfer to..."

494
00:59:09,637 --> 00:59:15,337
"Nag tape unit three."

495
00:59:16,144 --> 00:59:21,148
"Go straight six units."

496
00:59:21,149 --> 00:59:26,849
"Right 120 degrees"

497
00:59:27,155 --> 00:59:30,157
"four units."

498
00:59:30,158 --> 00:59:32,658
"Right 60 degrees"

499
00:59:32,659 --> 00:59:35,661
"four units."

500
00:59:35,662 --> 00:59:38,664
"Right 120 degrees"

501
00:59:38,665 --> 00:59:42,467
"six units."

502
01:00:00,686 --> 01:00:04,488
What are you doing?

503
01:00:05,191 --> 01:00:07,192
What are you doing?

504
01:00:07,193 --> 01:00:10,696
I'm doing something my way.

505
01:00:10,697 --> 01:00:14,200
I'm sending a message
to the ants.

506
01:00:14,201 --> 01:00:17,202
Yes, I've been thinking
about that.

507
01:00:17,203 --> 01:00:20,705
The conditioning process
must be working.

508
01:00:20,706 --> 01:00:24,709
But they're not all affected
as yet.

509
01:00:24,710 --> 01:00:27,712
They must be informed
of their losses

510
01:00:27,713 --> 01:00:29,714
and their suffering

511
01:00:29,715 --> 01:00:33,718
so they can draw
the appropriate conclusions.

512
01:00:33,719 --> 01:00:36,221
Where is your message?

513
01:00:36,222 --> 01:00:39,022
On the plotter.

514
01:00:49,234 --> 01:00:50,734
This is no message.

515
01:00:50,735 --> 01:00:52,736
Mathematics is
the universal language

516
01:00:52,737 --> 01:00:54,738
among intelligent creatures.

517
01:00:54,739 --> 01:00:56,740
If there's an intelligence there

518
01:00:56,741 --> 01:01:01,043
I want it to know
there's an intelligence here.

519
01:02:03,305 --> 01:02:05,805
Go away.

520
01:02:05,806 --> 01:02:11,110
Please go away.

521
01:02:30,330 --> 01:02:32,331
Hubbs: We're reviewing data.

522
01:02:32,332 --> 01:02:36,935
Previous analysis show...

523
01:02:39,139 --> 01:02:42,141
Do you wanna drink this?
Analysis...

524
01:02:42,142 --> 01:02:43,142
What?

525
01:02:43,143 --> 01:02:48,446
Clear, they failed to achieve
a...

526
01:02:48,647 --> 01:02:53,151
They will learn
we've made up our mind.

527
01:02:53,152 --> 01:02:57,955
How did they know?
How did they know?

528
01:02:59,158 --> 01:03:01,959
You!

529
01:03:21,679 --> 01:03:24,181
Kendra: Jim! Jim!

530
01:03:24,182 --> 01:03:28,485
Jim: What's going on
back there?

531
01:03:30,688 --> 01:03:34,190
Hubbs. Hubbs.
Come on, come on.

532
01:03:34,191 --> 01:03:39,891
I am not helpless,
I will not be humiliated.

533
01:04:22,237 --> 01:04:25,539
Got him!

534
01:04:29,744 --> 01:04:33,046
I'm sorry.

535
01:04:33,748 --> 01:04:37,050
Come on, come on.

536
01:05:04,278 --> 01:05:08,080
Could you hold me
for a minute?

537
01:06:08,339 --> 01:06:11,641
James?

538
01:06:12,843 --> 01:06:16,145
James?

539
01:06:18,349 --> 01:06:24,049
If I was irrational during
the heat of the day,

540
01:06:25,356 --> 01:06:28,657
I apologize.

541
01:06:33,363 --> 01:06:36,665
Why don't they kill us?

542
01:06:36,866 --> 01:06:42,566
Why roast us in here all day,
dare us to come out at night?

543
01:06:44,874 --> 01:06:48,675
Why play these games?

544
01:06:49,378 --> 01:06:53,180
What do they want?

545
01:06:53,382 --> 01:06:56,384
I've been thinking about
specialization

546
01:06:56,385 --> 01:07:00,187
among certain insects.

547
01:07:00,889 --> 01:07:03,891
Take it easy.

548
01:07:03,892 --> 01:07:06,894
Try to get some sleep.

549
01:07:06,895 --> 01:07:12,595
In every ant colony...

550
01:07:12,900 --> 01:07:18,600
Workers, winged males
and the queen.

551
01:07:19,907 --> 01:07:25,607
Ants are organized
by the queen.

552
01:07:25,913 --> 01:07:30,917
Keeping her alive.

553
01:07:30,918 --> 01:07:36,618
She's the heart and soul
of their lives.

554
01:07:38,425 --> 01:07:44,125
She's at the centre.
It is she who speaks.

555
01:07:44,931 --> 01:07:48,434
If she died,

556
01:07:48,435 --> 01:07:53,534
discipline, organization
would crumble.

557
01:07:57,443 --> 01:07:59,444
The war's over, hubbs.

558
01:07:59,445 --> 01:08:03,448
They have the power.

559
01:08:03,449 --> 01:08:07,952
Only hope now is if they answer
our message in the morning.

560
01:08:07,953 --> 01:08:10,455
Convince them
we're worth keeping alive.

561
01:08:10,456 --> 01:08:16,156
I think I could locate the queen
and kill her.

562
01:08:20,965 --> 01:08:26,665
Lock the tracker onto her voice
when she speaks.

563
01:08:27,972 --> 01:08:33,276
What makes you think
she'd speak to you?

564
01:08:43,487 --> 01:08:46,288
What is it?

565
01:08:46,990 --> 01:08:49,492
Th-the-the-

566
01:08:49,493 --> 01:08:52,495
lights.

567
01:08:52,496 --> 01:08:56,796
Ha-ha, it's just a...

568
01:09:19,021 --> 01:09:23,023
Bare in mind
we still have our hard suits.

569
01:09:23,024 --> 01:09:27,327
Yeah, two of them.

570
01:09:38,540 --> 01:09:42,343
They're sending back my message.

571
01:09:43,545 --> 01:09:47,347
Hubbs, there's more.

572
01:10:02,063 --> 01:10:05,364
What does it mean?

573
01:10:05,566 --> 01:10:09,068
What the hell does it mean?

574
01:10:09,069 --> 01:10:13,573
A circle with a dot.

575
01:10:13,574 --> 01:10:18,878
Now I know how a rat feels
in a maze.

576
01:10:22,583 --> 01:10:26,084
Rats in a maze.

577
01:10:26,085 --> 01:10:28,587
It's almost like
a controlled experiment

578
01:10:28,588 --> 01:10:34,288
in which we are the subjects.

579
01:10:34,594 --> 01:10:40,098
Find out which rat
is the smartest.

580
01:10:40,099 --> 01:10:43,401
The strongest.

581
01:10:48,607 --> 01:10:51,909
An intelligence test.

582
01:11:02,120 --> 01:11:06,923
Could the circle be this place?

583
01:11:09,627 --> 01:11:13,930
And what does the dot represent?

584
01:11:15,633 --> 01:11:18,635
Could the dot be a person?

585
01:11:18,636 --> 01:11:20,637
Someone they want.

586
01:11:20,638 --> 01:11:24,140
Who could they want?

587
01:11:24,141 --> 01:11:28,444
They want somebody?

588
01:11:28,646 --> 01:11:31,147
I think so.

589
01:11:31,148 --> 01:11:34,650
But why would they want
somebody?

590
01:11:34,651 --> 01:11:38,153
To talk to them.

591
01:11:38,154 --> 01:11:40,155
You mean they...

592
01:11:40,156 --> 01:11:44,660
They might be angry at someone
who did them some harm?

593
01:11:44,661 --> 01:11:47,663
What would they do
with that person?

594
01:11:47,664 --> 01:11:49,164
I don't know.

595
01:11:49,165 --> 01:11:53,168
Would they let the others
go free?

596
01:11:53,169 --> 01:11:54,669
James.

597
01:11:54,670 --> 01:11:57,972
Come here.

598
01:12:08,684 --> 01:12:14,384
I believe
I've located the queen.

599
01:12:21,195 --> 01:12:24,997
She's in there.

600
01:13:02,034 --> 01:13:05,036
♪ Oh, sweet to walk ♪

601
01:13:05,037 --> 01:13:10,737
♪ In the pilgrims way ♪

602

01:13:19,051 --> 01:13:24,751

♪ Leaning on the everla- ♪

606
01:14:06,095 --> 01:14:08,096
Where are the grenades?

607
01:14:08,097 --> 01:14:11,600
Used up when you destroyed
the towers.

608
01:14:11,601 --> 01:14:14,402
All of them?

609
01:14:16,105 --> 01:14:21,409
Then we must devise
something else.

610
01:14:42,131 --> 01:14:44,633
James, please I...

611
01:14:44,634 --> 01:14:46,134
My boots I...

612
01:14:46,135 --> 01:14:49,136
Would you please,
I can't...

613
01:14:49,137 --> 01:14:50,638
You're gonna walk out of here?

614
01:14:50,639 --> 01:14:53,641
Trek miles through the desert?

615
01:14:53,642 --> 01:14:55,142
Destroy a colony full of
poisonous ants

616
01:14:55,143 --> 01:14:57,144
and a deadly queen?

617
01:14:57,145 --> 01:14:59,647
You can't even
get your boots on.

618
01:14:59,648 --> 01:15:02,149
Come on, Hubbs, sit down.

619
01:15:02,150 --> 01:15:06,953
What we're gonna do
is send another message.

620
01:15:09,157 --> 01:15:11,957
You must go!

621
01:15:13,160 --> 01:15:16,162
You must show them

622
01:15:16,163 --> 01:15:17,664
we will not...

623
01:15:17,665 --> 01:15:22,969
Man will not give in.

624
01:15:30,678 --> 01:15:34,680
Did I tell you I figured out
their first message?

625
01:15:34,681 --> 01:15:37,983
The dot is you.

626
01:15:39,686 --> 01:15:42,187
They want you.

627
01:15:42,188 --> 01:15:45,990
And they shall soon have me.

628
01:15:58,704 --> 01:16:00,705
I'm sorry, Hubbs,

629
01:16:00,706 --> 01:16:04,508
it's not gonna happen your way.

630
01:16:16,721 --> 01:16:20,523
Kendra.

631
01:16:43,747 --> 01:16:46,248
Stop!
She's there.

632
01:16:46,249 --> 01:16:48,751
That hill, the queen.

633
01:16:48,752 --> 01:16:50,753
Hubbs, you can't do it.
Now come on, come on!

634
01:16:50,754 --> 01:16:53,555
Queen!

635
01:17:19,782 --> 01:17:22,782
Hubbs!

636
01:17:27,789 --> 01:17:30,791
Goddamn you.

637
01:17:30,792 --> 01:17:33,593
Hubbs!

638
01:17:59,319 --> 01:18:02,321
<i>I would still like</i>
<i>to believe that given time</i>

639
01:18:02,322 --> 01:18:06,324
<i>we could have come</i>
<i>to an understanding.</i>

640
01:18:06,325 --> 01:18:09,327
<i>Some rational accommodation</i>
<i>of interests,</i>

641
01:18:09,328 --> 01:18:14,131
<i>some agreement.</i>

642
01:18:14,333 --> 01:18:19,136
<i>But that's not the way</i>
<i>it's going to be.</i>

643
01:18:23,843 --> 01:18:27,845
<i>I've made some calculations</i>
<i>about their rate of expansion</i>

644
01:18:27,846 --> 01:18:31,849
<i>using their intelligence and</i>
<i>their powers of organization,</i>

645
01:18:31,850 --> 01:18:34,351
<i>and their network</i>
<i>of communications,</i>

646
01:18:34,352 --> 01:18:36,353
<i>their poisons.</i>

647
01:18:36,354 --> 01:18:38,355
<i>Their ability to adapt</i>
<i>genetically.</i>

648
01:18:38,356 --> 01:18:41,358
<i>I believe that after</i>
<i>this test run now</i>

649
01:18:41,359 --> 01:18:43,861
<i>they'll move rather quickly</i>
<i>into desert areas.</i>

650
01:18:43,862 --> 01:18:46,864
<i>Taking over the countryside</i>
<i>first</i>

651
01:18:46,865 --> 01:18:50,366
<i>then laying siege to towns</i>
<i>and cities.</i>

652
01:18:50,367 --> 01:18:52,869
<i>I believe they will learn</i>
<i>as they advance,</i>

653
01:18:52,870 --> 01:18:58,374
<i>anticipating our moves and</i>
<i>continue to stay a move ahead.</i>

654
01:18:58,375 --> 01:19:01,377
<i>We have only one chance,</i>

655
01:19:01,378 --> 01:19:04,881
<i>the counter attack</i>
<i>suggested by doctor Hubbs.</i>

656
01:19:04,882 --> 01:19:08,384
<i>A direct assault</i>
<i>on their queen.</i>

657
01:19:08,385 --> 01:19:12,688
<i>Jesus, I wish it wasn't me.</i>

658
01:19:21,398 --> 01:19:25,200
There you are.

659
01:20:49,482 --> 01:20:51,483
They wanted...

660
01:20:51,484 --> 01:20:54,085
Us.

661
01:21:18,310 --> 01:21:22,312
<i>We knew then,</i>
<i>we were being changed</i>

662
01:21:22,313 --> 01:21:26,115
<i>and made part of their world.</i>

663
01:21:26,817 --> 01:21:31,120
<i>We didn't know</i>
<i>for what purpose.</i>

664
01:21:31,322 --> 01:21:35,625
<i>But we knew we would be told.</i>
