1
00:02:26,498 --> 00:02:28,466
Driver's license?

2
00:02:38,596 --> 00:02:42,399
You know you was
ten Ks over back there?

3
00:02:46,395 --> 00:02:48,463
Where you headed?

4
00:02:50,462 --> 00:02:52,096
Been drinking today?

5
00:02:54,129 --> 00:02:55,196
No worries.

6
00:02:55,396 --> 00:02:58,431
Just need you to blow into this.

7
00:03:02,362 --> 00:03:05,563
Keep going. Yep.

8
00:03:11,592 --> 00:03:13,593
Step out
of the car, please.

9
00:03:16,359 --> 00:03:18,727
I said step
out of the car.

10
00:05:19,679 --> 00:05:21,713
Hey!

11
00:05:21,913 --> 00:05:24,747
Hey, fellas,
you wanna settle down there?

12
00:05:24,947 --> 00:05:28,014
Oi! You mob!

13
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:12,875
Morning, Mayor.
Sally.

14
00:06:13,075 --> 00:06:15,008
Usual?
Thanks.

15
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:19,974
Morning, Josh.
Maureen.

16
00:06:20,174 --> 00:06:26,278
Heard there was a bit of silly buggers down
here last night. Nothing too serious, I hope.

17
00:06:26,478 --> 00:06:27,672
Just the usual.

18
00:06:28,873 --> 00:06:31,040
How're you going?
Oh, I'm keeping busy.

19
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:36,143
There's... just shit going on with
the blackfellas out at Broken River.

20
00:06:36,343 --> 00:06:38,624
You know, they're drinking,
fighting, whatnot. So...

21
00:06:38,824 --> 00:06:41,105
I've got enough to keep me
in and out of trouble.

22
00:06:41,305 --> 00:06:43,005
I bet you do.

23
00:06:43,205 --> 00:06:49,176
Josh, there's something I've
been meaning to let you in on.

24
00:06:49,376 --> 00:06:53,240
Furnace Creek's applied
for a new expansion license.

25
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,270
For where?
Everywhere, just about.

26
00:06:55,470 --> 00:06:57,603
Well, the whole
Goldstone catchment, anyway.

27
00:06:57,803 --> 00:06:59,936
Fuck, that's bloody big.
Top you up, Josh?

28
00:07:00,136 --> 00:07:02,437
Yeah. Thanks, Sally.

29
00:07:03,834 --> 00:07:06,485
Yeah, it's a very big deal
for all of us,

30
00:07:06,685 --> 00:07:09,135
and I mean all of us.
But it's complicated.

31
00:07:09,335 --> 00:07:13,570
Needs blackfella approval,
and there's a mile of bright red tape.

32
00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:15,534
What do you want from me?

33
00:07:15,734 --> 00:07:19,302
Well, I know you don't like
to get too involved in things,

34
00:07:19,502 --> 00:07:20,901
but just keep your eyes
and ears open,

35
00:07:21,101 --> 00:07:26,805
and if you feel any heat,
especially from Broken River, let me know.

36
00:07:27,005 --> 00:07:29,934
We got Tommy from the
Land Council on our side,

37
00:07:30,134 --> 00:07:34,436
but we don't want anyone
further complicating things.

38
00:07:34,636 --> 00:07:38,332
Yeah, no worries.
Good.

39
00:07:38,532 --> 00:07:40,898
Also, you might want to know.

40
00:07:41,098 --> 00:07:44,767
A stranger blew into town last night.
A detective.

41
00:07:44,967 --> 00:07:47,665
And get this.
He's a blackfella.

42
00:07:47,865 --> 00:07:50,564
What, Indian black
or African black?

43
00:07:50,764 --> 00:07:52,764
No, I mean blackfella black.

44
00:07:52,964 --> 00:07:54,764
Near as I could
tell, anyhow.

45
00:07:54,964 --> 00:07:58,799
What's he doing here?
Ain't too sure yet.

46
00:07:58,999 --> 00:08:00,430
Well, find out.

47
00:08:01,796 --> 00:08:03,597
Hey.

48
00:08:06,361 --> 00:08:09,830
Apple?
'Course.

49
00:08:10,861 --> 00:08:14,063
And Josh? Remember.

50
00:08:16,395 --> 00:08:18,062
No worries.

51
00:09:39,251 --> 00:09:43,821
Mmm. Mmm. Yeah, I know.
What are we payin' em a fortune for?

52
00:09:44,021 --> 00:09:48,151
We should have had a contract
two fuckin' weeks ago.

53
00:09:48,351 --> 00:09:52,453
Look, if this thing falls through,
blame the fuckin' lawyers.

54
00:09:53,683 --> 00:09:57,419
No, I'm just saying if it did.

55
00:09:57,619 --> 00:10:00,817
Okay. Okay.

56
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:04,116
Gidday, Josh.
Johnny.

57
00:10:04,316 --> 00:10:07,484
You want a soft drink? Beer?
No. No, thanks.

58
00:10:10,016 --> 00:10:12,766
Jeez, I hope the boys
weren't too much trouble.

59
00:10:12,966 --> 00:10:15,716
I've pretty well
had a gutful at this point.

60
00:10:15,916 --> 00:10:17,382
Yeah, no,
you know what they're like.

61
00:10:17,582 --> 00:10:19,215
Look, I don't have
the time for it anymore,

62
00:10:19,415 --> 00:10:21,548
so if you can't fix it,

63
00:10:21,748 --> 00:10:24,581
I'll have
to start charging people.

64
00:10:24,781 --> 00:10:26,848
Come on, Josh. Mate,
you know as good as anyone

65
00:10:27,048 --> 00:10:32,918
with no mine, there is no pub, there's
no Josh, there's no fuckin' Goldstone.

66
00:10:33,118 --> 00:10:36,248
Without Furnace Creek,
we'd be a bloody piss stop

67
00:10:36,448 --> 00:10:39,146
on the highway to nowhere.

68
00:10:39,346 --> 00:10:42,414
You know, just like when
the blackfellas were in charge.

69
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:51,750
You... you heard
of the new expansion license?

70
00:10:55,210 --> 00:10:59,079
Look, you've always
been a good supporter, Josh.

71
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:03,113
You know, always been
looking for ways

72
00:11:03,313 --> 00:11:04,843
to show my appreciation.

73
00:11:08,509 --> 00:11:10,943
But this one's
major league, mate.

74
00:11:11,143 --> 00:11:14,444
We're talking
a few hundred million dollars

75
00:11:14,644 --> 00:11:17,110
worth of gold, probably more.

76
00:11:23,073 --> 00:11:26,342
I just need to know
if we can count on ya.

77
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:29,907
Looks like a lot
of trees there, Johnny.

78
00:11:30,107 --> 00:11:33,442
Oh, mate,
that's just for starters.

79
00:11:36,539 --> 00:11:40,939
How about... how about
I look after it for ya

80
00:11:41,139 --> 00:11:44,474
since it's, you know,
it's your first time and all.

81
00:11:45,738 --> 00:11:47,939
Look, I better
get back to it.

82
00:11:49,937 --> 00:11:55,608
All right. Yeah.
You have a good one, eh? Yeah, you too.

83
00:12:22,267 --> 00:12:23,601
Hey, old man.

84
00:12:25,533 --> 00:12:28,035
I was looking for Maria.

85
00:12:39,132 --> 00:12:40,566
Maria.

86
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:50,764
Who are you?

87
00:12:50,964 --> 00:12:53,098
My name's Jay.

88
00:12:53,298 --> 00:12:54,931
About six months ago,

89
00:12:55,131 --> 00:12:58,281
your phone was used
to call a police hotline.

90
00:12:58,481 --> 00:13:01,632
It was about an Asian-looking
girl in the desert.

91
00:13:01,832 --> 00:13:04,665
Did you make the call?

92
00:13:08,363 --> 00:13:09,763
And is this her?

93
00:13:16,362 --> 00:13:19,029
Could be.

94
00:13:19,229 --> 00:13:20,996
Where'd you see her?

95
00:13:22,694 --> 00:13:27,612
Under that first tree,
heading out to town.

96
00:13:27,812 --> 00:13:32,731
And what was she doing?
Sittin' in the shade.

97
00:13:32,931 --> 00:13:34,927
Did she look
like she needed help?

98
00:13:48,224 --> 00:13:49,658
Who's that?

99
00:13:54,091 --> 00:13:56,191
Oh, that's Tommy.

100
00:13:56,391 --> 00:13:59,892
Big Land Council boss.

101
00:15:35,481 --> 00:15:37,748
Yeah, what?

102
00:15:39,813 --> 00:15:43,880
Well, fuckin' deal with it.

103
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:48,082
Well, get onto Josh. Ask if
he knows anything about him.

104
00:15:48,282 --> 00:15:52,582
Right?

105
00:16:59,503 --> 00:17:01,937
Good evening, sir.

106
00:17:02,137 --> 00:17:04,571
Please, sit down.

107
00:17:10,903 --> 00:17:13,938
I'm Anne,
but you can call me Pinky.

108
00:17:15,869 --> 00:17:20,302
How long you been in town, Pinky?
A few days.

109
00:17:20,502 --> 00:17:25,572
I cruise in for a few weeks and then
I cruise out, just like you guys.

110
00:17:25,772 --> 00:17:30,339
Are you married?
Not anymore.

111
00:17:30,539 --> 00:17:33,570
I hear ya. Got kids?

112
00:17:33,770 --> 00:17:36,801
A beautiful girl.

113
00:17:40,666 --> 00:17:43,468
Yeah, she passed away last year.

114
00:17:45,799 --> 00:17:47,766
I'm sorry.

115
00:17:50,031 --> 00:17:54,668
Are you a single girl, Pinky?
Yeah, most of the time.

116
00:17:54,868 --> 00:18:00,002
You hear of things
happening out here?

117
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:02,798
Are you a cop?

118
00:18:05,431 --> 00:18:06,931
Sometimes.

119
00:18:09,964 --> 00:18:12,764
I've heard... stories

120
00:18:12,964 --> 00:18:15,363
about girls getting
caught up in stuff.

121
00:18:15,563 --> 00:18:19,799
But you should know by now that
all roads lead to Furnace Creek.

122
00:18:19,999 --> 00:18:22,948
There's nothing else out here.

123
00:18:23,148 --> 00:18:25,896
I do know one thing for sure,

124
00:18:26,096 --> 00:18:30,298
and that's this land
ain't no place for a young girl.

125
00:18:49,159 --> 00:18:51,276
I'll be gentle.

126
00:18:51,476 --> 00:18:53,593
Maybe next time.

127
00:18:56,092 --> 00:18:58,694
There is...

128
00:18:58,894 --> 00:19:00,526
no...

129
00:19:00,726 --> 00:19:04,761
next... time.

130
00:19:47,053 --> 00:19:49,020
Fuck!

131
00:20:13,050 --> 00:20:17,687
Jeez, you don't
mess around, do ya?

132
00:20:29,115 --> 00:20:31,650
SGs.

133
00:20:33,181 --> 00:20:35,382
They meant business.

134
00:20:38,247 --> 00:20:39,814
You wanna make a statement?

135
00:20:41,647 --> 00:20:44,516
Are you gonna tell me
what you're doin' out here?

136
00:20:44,716 --> 00:20:47,315
I know you ain't
out here on no holiday.

137
00:20:49,146 --> 00:20:51,380
Who sent ya?

138
00:20:54,745 --> 00:20:56,313
Missing Persons.

139
00:21:04,711 --> 00:21:08,712
Well... I'm gonna tell ya now,

140
00:21:08,912 --> 00:21:12,711
there must be some mistake.

141
00:21:12,911 --> 00:21:16,613
We got no missing
persons out here.

142
00:21:18,776 --> 00:21:22,278
Seems to me like
a big old waste of time.

143
00:21:22,478 --> 00:21:24,443
You should probably just

144
00:21:24,643 --> 00:21:28,312
turn that old rust
bucket of yours around and...

145
00:21:28,512 --> 00:21:29,943
head back
to where you came from.

146
00:21:36,341 --> 00:21:38,409
That's for you.

147
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:45,141
From the Region Commander.

148
00:21:45,341 --> 00:21:49,209
You wanna argue about it, you can give
'em a call and you can sort it out.

149
00:21:49,409 --> 00:21:52,676
But I'm guessing you don't want
any extra attention out here.

150
00:21:59,406 --> 00:22:01,239
Well, I can tell you now

151
00:22:01,439 --> 00:22:07,009
I ain't got time to be anybody's cattle dog,
especially yours.

152
00:22:07,209 --> 00:22:09,439
Anyway...

153
00:22:11,404 --> 00:22:14,338
old Ruby Rose,
she's as mad as hell.

154
00:22:14,538 --> 00:22:17,205
Wants you out of here
quick as a snail's fart.

155
00:22:17,405 --> 00:22:19,988
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

156
00:22:20,188 --> 00:22:22,771
Best get packin'.

157
00:22:42,234 --> 00:22:44,367
It's all off-grid.

158
00:22:44,567 --> 00:22:46,701
Gas fridge and stove.

159
00:22:52,867 --> 00:22:58,471
It's a bit rough,
but should be quiet enough.

160
00:22:58,671 --> 00:23:00,733
What's the old Winchester for?

161
00:23:04,264 --> 00:23:05,831
Mostly wild dogs.

162
00:23:08,598 --> 00:23:10,432
And whatever else
comes out of the desert.

163
00:23:10,632 --> 00:23:12,398
Ferals around here

164
00:23:12,598 --> 00:23:17,367
have been mixing
with the dingos.

165
00:23:17,567 --> 00:23:21,066
Making some crazy half-breed.

166
00:23:21,266 --> 00:23:24,765
Wilder than the purebreds.

167
00:23:24,965 --> 00:23:26,330
Twice as cunning.

168
00:23:30,895 --> 00:23:33,297
Just a word of warning.

169
00:23:35,128 --> 00:23:36,528
You see, out here...

170
00:23:36,529 --> 00:23:40,498
folks don't take
too kindly to outsiders.

171
00:23:41,961 --> 00:23:45,463
So if you do want
to go lookin' around,

172
00:23:45,663 --> 00:23:47,929
just be careful
where you step.

173
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,295
There's plenty
of snakes about.

174
00:26:43,208 --> 00:26:45,142
Take your hands off your gun!

175
00:26:45,342 --> 00:26:46,975
Take your hands
off your fucking gun!

176
00:26:47,175 --> 00:26:48,208
Now drop to your knees slowly!

177
00:26:48,209 --> 00:26:49,475
Put your hands on your head.

178
00:26:49,675 --> 00:26:51,675
Put your hands
on your fuckin' head!

179
00:27:46,835 --> 00:27:48,002
Go.

180
00:28:00,433 --> 00:28:02,068
How're ya goin'?

181
00:28:02,268 --> 00:28:04,434
You can call me Johnny.

182
00:28:06,499 --> 00:28:09,201
Can I get you
a cold refreshment?

183
00:28:09,401 --> 00:28:11,833
You want a soft drink? Beer?

184
00:28:16,865 --> 00:28:22,169
Do you realize you were...
intercepted well within a restricted area?

185
00:28:22,369 --> 00:28:27,234
You know, it's a fuckin'
dangerous worksite out here.

186
00:28:27,434 --> 00:28:29,398
You know,
you could have been injured.

187
00:28:29,598 --> 00:28:31,631
Well, even worse than that.

188
00:28:31,831 --> 00:28:37,701
What were you doing out here?
I just got lost.

189
00:28:44,128 --> 00:28:47,964
You get lost much,
Detective?

190
00:28:52,294 --> 00:28:55,296
And what'd you
see out there tonight?

191
00:28:58,393 --> 00:29:00,127
A beautiful sunset.

192
00:29:00,327 --> 00:29:04,596
Oh, beautiful sunset, yeah.

193
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:16,163
You might wear a badge,
work for the Crown.

194
00:29:16,363 --> 00:29:18,026
So do we.

195
00:29:18,226 --> 00:29:20,792
The difference is that

196
00:29:20,992 --> 00:29:24,526
we keep this country
in business.

197
00:29:24,726 --> 00:29:27,124
See, it's all about...

198
00:29:27,324 --> 00:29:29,391
it's all about standards
of living, you know?

199
00:29:29,591 --> 00:29:35,762
We can't stop the wheel turning
for anyone, including you.

200
00:29:36,856 --> 00:29:39,090
So I suggest...

201
00:29:39,290 --> 00:29:43,007
I suggest that you...
you get on your horse

202
00:29:43,207 --> 00:29:46,925
and ya fuckin' ride
out of here while ya can.

203
00:29:48,221 --> 00:29:49,822
Go on.

204
00:29:49,823 --> 00:29:52,289
Drive safe, though.

205
00:29:52,489 --> 00:29:54,955
Drive safe.

206
00:30:05,553 --> 00:30:07,354
Hooroo.

207
00:30:44,948 --> 00:30:47,416
Mayor's invited you
to morning tea.

208
00:30:50,148 --> 00:30:52,316
She'll be expecting ya.

209
00:31:00,714 --> 00:31:03,449
What were you doing out
at Furnace Creek last night?

210
00:31:03,649 --> 00:31:07,381
You just can't go
wanderin' round like that.

211
00:31:07,581 --> 00:31:09,781
You cross the border
at Furnace Creek, copper or not,

212
00:31:09,981 --> 00:31:11,780
they got their
rights to kill ya.

213
00:31:15,379 --> 00:31:17,881
You know what
goes on out there?

214
00:31:18,081 --> 00:31:20,047
What are you talking about?

215
00:31:20,247 --> 00:31:22,814
Talking about a plane
full of Asian girls.

216
00:31:26,144 --> 00:31:27,645
It's all done off-site.

217
00:31:27,845 --> 00:31:31,247
They fly in, they fly out.
It's all legal.

218
00:31:31,447 --> 00:31:34,379
You heard of trafficking?

219
00:31:36,209 --> 00:31:37,610
Jesus, Jay.

220
00:31:37,810 --> 00:31:40,310
Well, how do you know
they're not being trafficked?

221
00:31:40,510 --> 00:31:41,910
How do you know they are?

222
00:31:47,042 --> 00:31:49,544
Don't make no difference.

223
00:31:51,175 --> 00:31:54,878
That kind of shit
ain't my watch.

224
00:31:55,078 --> 00:31:56,375
Belongs to the Feds.

225
00:31:56,575 --> 00:31:59,476
Do you know where
they keep the girls?

226
00:32:01,274 --> 00:32:04,208
That ain't your concern.

227
00:32:04,408 --> 00:32:07,343
And why ain't it yours?

228
00:32:07,543 --> 00:32:09,940
You on the take?

229
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:11,840
Part of the security team?

230
00:32:15,872 --> 00:32:17,806
What?

231
00:32:21,205 --> 00:32:23,874
You calling me
dirty there, Jay?

232
00:32:26,371 --> 00:32:28,806
That what you're doin'?

233
00:32:29,006 --> 00:32:30,672
Callin' me dirty?

234
00:32:30,872 --> 00:32:33,438
Who's letting the grog
into Broken River?

235
00:32:33,638 --> 00:32:37,640
It's a dry community
and it's soaking with piss.

236
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:40,504
And it's on your watch.

237
00:32:40,704 --> 00:32:44,873
Askin' or callin',
whatever you want it to be.

238
00:33:15,566 --> 00:33:18,802
Brother boy.
Where you from?

239
00:33:20,898 --> 00:33:22,398
Oh, here and there.

240
00:33:23,831 --> 00:33:25,832
What were you
doing up at Broken River?

241
00:33:27,831 --> 00:33:29,699
Just lookin' around.

242
00:33:31,297 --> 00:33:35,132
Well, you see,
we got protocols out here.

243
00:33:35,332 --> 00:33:38,933
This is not your country
to go walkin' around on.

244
00:33:39,133 --> 00:33:42,532
You're a guest here.

245
00:33:42,732 --> 00:33:45,929
Just like the white man.

246
00:33:46,129 --> 00:33:48,964
You understand,
brother boy?

247
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:11,663
Mr. Swan. Come on in.

248
00:34:11,863 --> 00:34:12,759
Sit down.

249
00:34:15,925 --> 00:34:19,428
You can call me Maureen.

250
00:34:21,326 --> 00:34:22,726
Milk and sugar?

251
00:34:26,391 --> 00:34:30,127
Now, Mr. Swan...
Jay, isn't it?

252
00:34:30,327 --> 00:34:32,191
I'm going to call you Jay.

253
00:34:32,391 --> 00:34:36,276
I heard something
about a missing person.

254
00:34:36,476 --> 00:34:40,361
You see, there's not much
I don't know about

255
00:34:40,561 --> 00:34:42,358
when it comes to Goldstone.

256
00:34:43,990 --> 00:34:46,890
Now, out here, Jay,

257
00:34:47,090 --> 00:34:49,723
we run a very tight ship,

258
00:34:49,923 --> 00:34:54,860
where even the smallest stones
can cause mighty big ripples.

259
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:58,558
And we don't take
too kindly to mob who come in

260
00:34:58,758 --> 00:35:01,223
and throw stones
with no reason.

261
00:35:01,423 --> 00:35:03,821
Young Josh is a good boy.

262
00:35:04,021 --> 00:35:09,491
Took him a while,
but he understands how this place works.

263
00:35:09,691 --> 00:35:12,639
So I suggest you keep
your head down,

264
00:35:12,839 --> 00:35:15,788
keep those waters
nice and still.

265
00:35:17,186 --> 00:35:18,654
Yeah?

266
00:35:18,854 --> 00:35:23,356
Oh, and this is for you.

267
00:35:26,285 --> 00:35:28,620
I was planning
to give you just one slice,

268
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:30,853
but I thought,
what the hell.

269
00:35:31,053 --> 00:35:33,569
Hope you got a sweet tooth.

270
00:35:33,769 --> 00:35:36,084
Thanks for the little chat.

271
00:35:36,284 --> 00:35:40,920
And if you need
anything, just ask.

272
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:43,786
And I mean anything.

273
00:35:43,986 --> 00:35:55,986
<b><i>Psagmeno.com | No1 Subs iNFO</i></b>

274
00:36:36,145 --> 00:36:39,414
Hey, Josh.
Gidday, Mick.

275
00:36:43,276 --> 00:36:47,246
Looking for a bit of love?
Oh, not tonight.

276
00:36:47,446 --> 00:36:49,543
Bit of business, actually.

277
00:36:49,743 --> 00:36:52,260
Oh, yeah,
what kind of business?

278
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:54,978
You got foreign
workers here, yeah?

279
00:36:55,178 --> 00:36:57,410
Yeah, like usual.

280
00:36:57,610 --> 00:36:59,643
They got work visas?

281
00:36:59,843 --> 00:37:02,277
As far as I know.
Why, is there a problem?

282
00:37:02,477 --> 00:37:05,176
No, no, no.
No, just an inquiry.

283
00:37:05,376 --> 00:37:07,375
An inquiry?
Yeah.

284
00:37:07,575 --> 00:37:09,709
Yeah, I want to talk to 'em.

285
00:37:11,473 --> 00:37:13,842
What, now?
Yeah.

286
00:37:14,042 --> 00:37:16,375
Well, they're busy.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know.

287
00:37:16,575 --> 00:37:18,291
Won't take long.

288
00:37:18,491 --> 00:37:20,007
You know, Josh,

289
00:37:20,207 --> 00:37:22,857
some people might
call this a raid.

290
00:37:23,057 --> 00:37:25,708
Come on, Mick,
it's not a big deal.

291
00:37:30,605 --> 00:37:34,941
Excuse us, Mick, Mrs. Lao.

292
00:37:45,037 --> 00:37:46,470
You girls speak English?

293
00:37:52,602 --> 00:37:56,505
Are any of you girls
here against your will?

294
00:38:00,335 --> 00:38:03,804
Has anybody threatened you
in any way?

295
00:38:09,901 --> 00:38:13,669
Are any of you being
forced to pay back money?

296
00:38:19,533 --> 00:38:21,534
Okay, thanks for your time.

297
00:38:29,298 --> 00:38:32,999
Today here we make history.

298
00:38:33,199 --> 00:38:38,903
Today we guarantee
your community's security.

299
00:38:39,103 --> 00:38:41,435
We're talking
about infrastructure.

300
00:38:41,635 --> 00:38:43,765
We're talking jobs and training.

301
00:38:43,965 --> 00:38:49,101
Getting those lost kids off the
drugs and into full-time jobs.

302
00:38:49,301 --> 00:38:52,133
Look, I know some of you
mob are worried about your...

303
00:38:52,333 --> 00:38:55,766
your sacred sites
and protecting your culture.

304
00:38:55,966 --> 00:38:59,096
But at Furnace Creek,
we pride ourselves

305
00:38:59,296 --> 00:39:04,366
on our environmental
and our cultural record.

306
00:39:04,566 --> 00:39:06,728
We hold our hands out

307
00:39:06,928 --> 00:39:12,180
to walk together down
this new pathway to the future

308
00:39:12,380 --> 00:39:17,632
with the approval of this
new exploration agreement.

309
00:39:17,832 --> 00:39:20,180
Let's just jump to it
and I'll invite

310
00:39:20,380 --> 00:39:22,527
the Broken River
council board members

311
00:39:22,727 --> 00:39:27,130
to come up here to give their autographs of
approval in front of youse all here today.

312
00:39:27,330 --> 00:39:28,993
Thank you.

313
00:39:46,025 --> 00:39:47,091
Jimmy.

314
00:39:48,357 --> 00:39:49,624
Jimmy!

315
00:40:21,286 --> 00:40:22,854
Hey, old man.

316
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:30,354
You want a ride?

317
00:40:47,417 --> 00:40:52,688
Lookin' for that girl?
Chinese one, eh?

318
00:40:52,888 --> 00:40:55,551
Yeah, you know something?

319
00:40:58,383 --> 00:41:01,716
My grandfather
saw first white man here.

320
00:41:01,916 --> 00:41:05,733
He come on a camel.
Then the Chinese men come.

321
00:41:05,933 --> 00:41:09,750
They said they all
look for the gold stone.

322
00:41:09,950 --> 00:41:14,285
And they follow
the same God.

323
00:41:14,485 --> 00:41:16,383
Money god.

324
00:41:19,114 --> 00:41:22,516
I know why you came here.

325
00:41:22,716 --> 00:41:25,181
I know your face.

326
00:41:25,381 --> 00:41:27,714
Just like your father.

327
00:41:31,313 --> 00:41:32,446
What, you knew him?

328
00:41:32,646 --> 00:41:36,979
He be taken away
when he was a young boy.

329
00:41:37,179 --> 00:41:42,716
Then he came back a man
and he said he had a son.

330
00:41:47,344 --> 00:41:49,579
Must be you.

331
00:41:53,011 --> 00:41:55,044
See that bird?

332
00:41:57,442 --> 00:41:59,510
You hit 'em with the car.

333
00:42:04,175 --> 00:42:06,892
Next time you be careful.

334
00:42:07,092 --> 00:42:09,608
Look after him. Protect him.

335
00:42:09,808 --> 00:42:12,942
They need more time
to understand.

336
00:42:13,142 --> 00:42:17,711
But when you need him,
they save your life.

337
00:42:17,911 --> 00:42:19,341
They'll find the water,

338
00:42:19,541 --> 00:42:22,376
just the middle of nowhere,
in the desert.

339
00:42:22,576 --> 00:42:25,341
Clean water, too.

340
00:42:25,541 --> 00:42:30,058
Yep. I show you something.
What?

341
00:42:30,258 --> 00:42:34,775
What you really come here for.

342
00:42:36,072 --> 00:42:37,773
Don't worry, not far.

343
00:42:40,271 --> 00:42:42,306
That way.

344
00:43:58,364 --> 00:44:00,064
Hey.

345
00:44:07,129 --> 00:44:08,896
What's wrong?

346
00:44:10,895 --> 00:44:16,033
Well... I'm thinking
of gettin' out, Maureen.

347
00:44:17,295 --> 00:44:20,030
I'm thinking to quit
while I'm ahead.

348
00:44:20,230 --> 00:44:22,195
Quittin'?

349
00:44:22,395 --> 00:44:25,596
But Johnny,
we're so close.

350
00:44:27,460 --> 00:44:29,594
Old Jimmy walked out
of the signing ceremony.

351
00:44:29,794 --> 00:44:34,664
What? Tommy told me there'd
be no problem with Jimmy.

352
00:44:34,864 --> 00:44:36,394
Yeah, well, he is.
He's a big fuckin' problem.

353
00:44:36,594 --> 00:44:40,262
Already told the suits down
south we've got the green light.

354
00:44:40,462 --> 00:44:41,492
Maybe he wants more money.

355
00:44:41,692 --> 00:44:43,025
I'll have a chat to Tommy.
No, no.

356
00:44:43,027 --> 00:44:44,526
He's the type
you can't buy.

357
00:44:44,726 --> 00:44:47,226
You know,
he doesn't go to church.

358
00:44:47,426 --> 00:44:51,862
Hasn't touched a drop of the grog
we've been runnin' out there.

359
00:44:52,062 --> 00:44:54,258
The old ways
are in his blood.

360
00:44:54,458 --> 00:44:56,758
Probably hold off
until he fuckin' dies.

361
00:44:58,757 --> 00:45:02,727
Maybe we could speed things up.

362
00:45:06,888 --> 00:45:08,822
What do you mean?

363
00:45:09,022 --> 00:45:10,956
You know what I mean.

364
00:45:13,121 --> 00:45:16,822
Fuckin' shit, no. No, no.

365
00:45:17,022 --> 00:45:22,926
Johnny, we got so much
at stake here, remember?

366
00:45:23,126 --> 00:45:25,724
Just leave it with me.

367
00:45:25,924 --> 00:45:28,389
I'll do everything.

368
00:45:28,589 --> 00:45:31,055
Okay? Okay, babe?

369
00:46:00,917 --> 00:46:03,417
Hey, Josh. Back again?

370
00:46:03,617 --> 00:46:05,917
Yeah, looks like it.

371
00:46:06,117 --> 00:46:10,720
Business or pleasure?
Pleasure.

372
00:47:00,810 --> 00:47:02,410
Where you from?

373
00:47:03,477 --> 00:47:07,513
A small town
a long way from here.

374
00:47:08,675 --> 00:47:10,710
You?

375
00:47:10,711 --> 00:47:14,012
A small town,
long way from here.

376
00:47:17,941 --> 00:47:19,709
What's your name?

377
00:47:21,175 --> 00:47:22,909
Mei.

378
00:47:24,341 --> 00:47:26,775
How'd you get here?

379
00:47:26,975 --> 00:47:29,208
It's a long story.

380
00:47:29,408 --> 00:47:32,443
It's okay.
You can trust me.

381
00:47:34,974 --> 00:47:36,841
You come here much?

382
00:47:39,106 --> 00:47:40,773
Sometimes.

383
00:47:41,973 --> 00:47:44,941
You don't look like
the others around here.

384
00:47:46,206 --> 00:47:47,673
How's that?

385
00:47:47,873 --> 00:47:51,139
You just look different.

386
00:47:51,339 --> 00:47:55,972
Nah, I'm just
the same as them.

387
00:47:56,172 --> 00:47:58,973
Maybe I just didn't
start out that way, though.

388
00:47:59,173 --> 00:48:01,656
How did you?

389
00:48:01,856 --> 00:48:04,339
I don't know.

390
00:48:06,036 --> 00:48:10,888
Didn't do things
the way other folks did.

391
00:48:11,088 --> 00:48:15,940
I didn't believe
what other folks believed.

392
00:48:16,140 --> 00:48:19,405
What did you believe?

393
00:48:19,605 --> 00:48:22,438
Doesn't matter.

394
00:48:25,301 --> 00:48:27,602
That boy's long gone.

395
00:48:32,534 --> 00:48:34,735
So why all
the questions, Mei?

396
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:39,869
So I don't
have to answer yours.

397
00:48:40,069 --> 00:48:43,069
Clever girl.

398
00:48:45,366 --> 00:48:48,650
What do you really want,
Mr. Policeman?

399
00:48:48,850 --> 00:48:52,134
Need to know what's
going on out here.

400
00:48:52,334 --> 00:48:54,466
What do you think
is going on?

401
00:48:55,398 --> 00:48:58,232
Not too sure yet.

402
00:48:58,432 --> 00:49:00,966
The truth can be
hard to find out here,

403
00:49:01,166 --> 00:49:03,398
especially once
the sun goes down.

404
00:49:05,097 --> 00:49:08,414
And when you find the truth,

405
00:49:08,614 --> 00:49:11,932
what will you do about it?

406
00:49:57,791 --> 00:50:01,025
<i>Yeah?
I got some information.</i>

407
00:50:01,225 --> 00:50:05,861
<i>About what?
About what the fuck's going on.</i>

408
00:50:06,061 --> 00:50:07,657
Who is this?

409
00:50:07,658 --> 00:50:10,993
<i>Meet me out
at Shadow Tree Crossroads.</i>

410
00:52:24,775 --> 00:52:26,008
What happened?

411
00:52:26,009 --> 00:52:29,477
Looks like the old man
tanked himself.

412
00:52:30,675 --> 00:52:33,175
How do you know that?

413
00:52:33,375 --> 00:52:35,943
'Cause I know
what it looks like.

414
00:52:40,340 --> 00:52:41,507
Except usually it's the kids.

415
00:52:41,508 --> 00:52:43,808
We had five in the last year.

416
00:52:48,540 --> 00:52:50,240
And I got a witness.

417
00:52:52,507 --> 00:52:56,473
Said he
came here fishin'.

418
00:52:56,673 --> 00:52:58,539
Saw old Jimmy
swinging from the tree,

419
00:52:58,739 --> 00:53:01,407
but... it was too late.

420
00:53:05,204 --> 00:53:06,972
Sadly.

421
00:56:18,983 --> 00:56:20,951
Josh!

422
00:56:23,516 --> 00:56:25,551
Oh, hope I'm not interrupting.

423
00:56:25,751 --> 00:56:29,052
I was just heading home
and I saw the car.

424
00:56:29,252 --> 00:56:30,883
No, you're all right, Maureen.

425
00:56:31,083 --> 00:56:33,283
I just heard about Jimmy.

426
00:56:33,483 --> 00:56:36,316
Shame, takin' his
own life like that.

427
00:56:36,516 --> 00:56:40,882
Yeah, I know. I didn't
think he was the type.

428
00:56:41,082 --> 00:56:45,485
Oh, it's often the way it goes.
Ones you least expect.

429
00:56:45,685 --> 00:56:50,081
Yeah.
Is there a problem?

430
00:56:50,281 --> 00:56:53,214
No, no, just... just procedure.

431
00:56:53,414 --> 00:56:56,146
I record all
the suicides we get.

432
00:56:56,346 --> 00:56:59,014
Oh, good. I want to make
sure there's no problems

433
00:56:59,214 --> 00:57:03,750
for the family getting a release so
they can go ahead with the burial.

434
00:57:03,950 --> 00:57:07,415
Can be really painful,
dragging these things out.

435
00:57:07,615 --> 00:57:10,878
Yeah, no worries.
No worries, Maureen. I'll...

436
00:57:11,078 --> 00:57:13,778
I'll get Max over in the morning
and I'll dress the body.

437
00:57:13,978 --> 00:57:16,679
Should be ready by tomorrow afternoon.
Oh, good, Josh.

438
00:57:16,879 --> 00:57:19,379
Appreciate it.
No worries.

439
00:57:19,579 --> 00:57:21,877
Oh, there's one other thing...

440
00:57:22,077 --> 00:57:27,714
Don't ya reckon Mr. Swan has
overstayed his welcome, eh?

441
00:57:28,843 --> 00:57:29,943
Yeah, I get your drift,

442
00:57:29,944 --> 00:57:32,310
but it might not be so easy.

443
00:57:32,510 --> 00:57:34,876
He's here on Federal authority.

444
00:57:36,209 --> 00:57:38,177
Joshua.

445
00:57:38,377 --> 00:57:42,779
Since when were you afraid
of a little authority?

446
00:57:43,941 --> 00:57:45,942
Talk later.

447
00:58:49,735 --> 00:58:53,371
I want you out of here,
pure and simple.

448
00:58:55,333 --> 00:58:57,468
I did some checkin'.

449
00:58:57,668 --> 00:58:59,935
I know why you
got sent out here.

450
00:59:01,733 --> 00:59:03,767
Because of the hornet's nest
you set on fire

451
00:59:03,967 --> 00:59:05,400
back in your hometown.

452
00:59:05,600 --> 00:59:09,099
I've gotta admit,
lookin' at you now,

453
00:59:09,299 --> 00:59:12,799
I wouldn't have thought
you had it in ya.

454
00:59:14,265 --> 00:59:16,499
Five men ended...

455
00:59:17,931 --> 00:59:20,566
pretty much single-handed.

456
00:59:22,330 --> 00:59:25,866
Jesus, you're
a dangerous man, Jay.

457
00:59:34,263 --> 00:59:38,432
I guess all that
blood on your hands...

458
00:59:38,632 --> 00:59:40,464
send anyone to drink.

459
00:59:47,794 --> 00:59:49,695
Ya ever loved anyone?

460
00:59:51,361 --> 00:59:53,295
What do you reckon?

461
00:59:54,294 --> 00:59:55,427
I reckon you're too gutless

462
00:59:55,627 --> 00:59:58,528
to do a lot of things.

463
00:59:58,728 --> 01:00:01,428
It's probably one of 'em.

464
01:00:01,628 --> 01:00:04,562
Just end in a big
fuckin' mess anyway.

465
01:00:05,560 --> 01:00:08,326
I reckon I'll just bypass it.

466
01:00:08,526 --> 01:00:11,826
Yeah, why not bypass
the whole fuckin' thing?

467
01:00:12,026 --> 01:00:15,192
But you already thought
about that more than once.

468
01:00:15,392 --> 01:00:19,628
Pulling that Glock out of your
holster and popping it in your mouth.

469
01:00:19,828 --> 01:00:23,694
Out here,
all on your lonesome.

470
01:00:24,690 --> 01:00:26,625
Fuck you, Jay.

471
01:00:28,423 --> 01:00:31,157
Fuckin' bypass.

472
01:00:31,357 --> 01:00:33,924
Like this whole
fuckin' country.

473
01:00:38,723 --> 01:00:41,791
You think your missing girl's out there,
you go right on ahead.

474
01:00:41,991 --> 01:00:43,523
I won't stop ya.

475
01:00:43,723 --> 01:00:46,657
But you're chasin'
a fuckin' ghost, Jay.

476
01:00:49,221 --> 01:00:54,492
You got no witness
and you got no victim.

477
01:00:57,320 --> 01:00:58,921
No fuckin' crime.

478
01:01:04,319 --> 01:01:06,921
Belongs to the missing girl.

479
01:01:09,518 --> 01:01:11,253
Where'd you get it?
Doesn't matter.

480
01:01:11,453 --> 01:01:13,152
It's just a lost passport.

481
01:01:13,153 --> 01:01:15,721
Oh, it's just a lost passport.
What, just like an old man

482
01:01:15,921 --> 01:01:19,921
just killed himself...
on your watch.

483
01:01:34,216 --> 01:01:39,020
You think you or me or anyone can make
a difference to any fuckin' thing?

484
01:01:39,220 --> 01:01:44,219
Think you really cleaned up
that town of yours?

485
01:01:44,419 --> 01:01:46,383
You might have
stirred up a bit of dirt,

486
01:01:46,583 --> 01:01:48,850
but it's just a matter
of time that the dust settles.

487
01:01:49,050 --> 01:01:52,584
Well, at least
it's a little bit thinner.

488
01:01:54,947 --> 01:01:59,084
You go out there, guns blazing,
they'll probably kill ya.

489
01:01:59,284 --> 01:02:02,881
And all of this shit,
it'll just keep goin' round.

490
01:02:03,081 --> 01:02:06,949
And I'll be the one stuck on light
duties in some fuckin' hell hole.

491
01:02:09,512 --> 01:02:11,914
I thought you
were already there.

492
01:03:44,502 --> 01:03:47,636
Why did you come back?

493
01:03:47,836 --> 01:03:50,704
Still looking for the truth?

494
01:03:50,904 --> 01:03:52,236
Or something else?

495
01:03:54,235 --> 01:03:55,902
I don't know.

496
01:03:57,268 --> 01:04:03,173
Maybe... a lot of things.

497
01:04:03,373 --> 01:04:04,567
All at once.

498
01:04:11,166 --> 01:04:14,368
Why did you choose me
from the others?

499
01:04:16,699 --> 01:04:18,933
I guess something
just caught my eye.

500
01:04:21,131 --> 01:04:22,899
What something?

501
01:04:26,664 --> 01:04:31,501
You sure you are just
like the others, Mr. Policeman?

502
01:04:33,164 --> 01:04:35,031
What are you
really doin' here?

503
01:04:35,231 --> 01:04:37,432
What do you think?

504
01:04:38,597 --> 01:04:40,297
I think you're pretending.

505
01:04:40,497 --> 01:04:43,164
Pretending what?

506
01:04:43,364 --> 01:04:45,497
To be like the others.

507
01:04:45,697 --> 01:04:49,899
I do what they do.
Makes me no different.

508
01:04:51,229 --> 01:04:55,599
Just like you,
do like the others.

509
01:04:57,127 --> 01:04:58,628
Let me help you.

510
01:04:58,828 --> 01:05:01,762
Why do you
think I need it?

511
01:05:01,962 --> 01:05:04,896
'Cause it's in your eyes.

512
01:05:09,259 --> 01:05:11,894
And why should I trust you?

513
01:05:12,094 --> 01:05:17,898
I'm giving you a choice...
to be who you wanna be.

514
01:05:19,125 --> 01:05:22,292
Maybe it's me...

515
01:05:22,492 --> 01:05:24,626
giving you the choice.

516
01:05:33,591 --> 01:05:36,693
If you need help,
press this green button.

517
01:05:39,289 --> 01:05:40,656
And I'll come.

518
01:05:41,690 --> 01:05:44,658
Then what will
become of you?

519
01:05:55,688 --> 01:05:58,872
We are gathered today,
my brothers and sisters,

520
01:05:59,072 --> 01:06:02,257
to return our brother
Jimmy to mother earth.

521
01:06:02,457 --> 01:06:05,089
His life
is not destroyed by death.

522
01:06:05,289 --> 01:06:07,721
God has taken him
to eternal life.

523
01:06:07,921 --> 01:06:12,538
As we commend Jimmy to God
and commit his body to the earth

524
01:06:12,738 --> 01:06:17,356
let us express in prayer our
common faith in the resurrection.

525
01:06:17,556 --> 01:06:19,988
As Jesus Christ was
raised from the dead,

526
01:06:20,188 --> 01:06:22,621
we too are called
to follow him through death

527
01:06:22,821 --> 01:06:26,155
to the glory
of eternal life with God.

528
01:06:30,651 --> 01:06:32,786
Old Jimmy told me
all about you.

529
01:06:36,217 --> 01:06:38,885
He wanted me
to give you this.

530
01:06:40,683 --> 01:06:43,184
Your father
had two brothers.

531
01:06:43,384 --> 01:06:46,485
That's them at the
front there, on the side.

532
01:06:46,685 --> 01:06:48,650
Your father's
the one at the end.

533
01:06:52,316 --> 01:06:53,883
What happened to them?

534
01:06:55,181 --> 01:06:57,449
Government sent people away.

535
01:06:57,649 --> 01:07:00,282
Far away from here.

536
01:07:00,482 --> 01:07:04,448
They must
have been with 'em.

537
01:07:04,648 --> 01:07:07,683
There's a lot of families
out here won't accept you.

538
01:07:07,883 --> 01:07:11,766
They want to keep everything
for themselves.

539
01:07:11,966 --> 01:07:15,849
But old Jimmy
wanted you to know that...

540
01:07:17,446 --> 01:07:21,883
This mob... it's your mob.

541
01:07:23,146 --> 01:07:25,581
This land, you belong to it.

542
01:08:40,470 --> 01:08:45,341
Come in!

543
01:08:47,236 --> 01:08:49,871
Detective Swan.

544
01:08:50,071 --> 01:08:52,205
Cuppa tea?

545
01:09:01,935 --> 01:09:04,069
Grandchildren?

546
01:09:04,269 --> 01:09:07,701
Nah, I couldn't have kids.

547
01:09:07,901 --> 01:09:11,603
So I figured sponsors
was the next best thing.

548
01:09:17,567 --> 01:09:19,401
I heard you were
at Jimmy's funeral.

549
01:09:19,601 --> 01:09:23,503
Just plain terrible
what's happening out there.

550
01:09:23,703 --> 01:09:26,234
People taking
their own lives.

551
01:09:26,434 --> 01:09:28,766
We lost a bunch
of kids last year.

552
01:09:28,966 --> 01:09:32,000
Yeah, I was speaking
to Jimmy's daughter, Maria.

553
01:09:32,200 --> 01:09:33,933
She must be devastated.

554
01:09:34,133 --> 01:09:36,732
Yeah, she was saying
Jimmy was gettin' pressure.

555
01:09:36,932 --> 01:09:41,734
Really? Who from?
The Land Council and Furnace Creek.

556
01:09:43,664 --> 01:09:48,901
I heard you caused a bit of
commotion back in your hometown.

557
01:09:49,101 --> 01:09:51,596
Is that right?

558
01:09:51,796 --> 01:09:55,080
I was just doin' my job.

559
01:09:55,280 --> 01:09:58,363
My daddy was a sheep farmer

560
01:09:58,563 --> 01:10:02,198
a long way south
and a little bit east of here.

561
01:10:02,398 --> 01:10:07,465
Fifty thousand acres
of the most desolate,

562
01:10:07,665 --> 01:10:10,563
driest land you've ever seen.

563
01:10:10,763 --> 01:10:13,462
Now, my daddy was a hard man,

564
01:10:13,662 --> 01:10:17,829
but my granddaddy...
he was from a different world.

565
01:10:18,029 --> 01:10:22,197
Nothing my daddy did could
ever please that old man.

566
01:10:22,397 --> 01:10:26,493
There was no pleasing
my daddy, either.

567
01:10:26,693 --> 01:10:31,362
When I heard he'd hanged himself in
the feed shed one October morning,

568
01:10:31,562 --> 01:10:34,159
I couldn't feel any sorrow.

569
01:10:34,359 --> 01:10:38,562
Couldn't find
a reason to miss him.

570
01:10:38,762 --> 01:10:41,459
And then it dawned on me.

571
01:10:43,090 --> 01:10:45,058
I was just like him.

572
01:10:45,258 --> 01:10:48,860
Daddy and Granddaddy,
the three of us.

573
01:10:49,060 --> 01:10:51,191
As hard as that trampled on,

574
01:10:51,391 --> 01:10:55,508
dried old earth
that we grew up on.

575
01:10:55,708 --> 01:10:59,826
So after skippin'
from town to town,

576
01:11:00,026 --> 01:11:02,241
marriage number five,

577
01:11:02,441 --> 01:11:04,456
I just let things go.

578
01:11:04,656 --> 01:11:09,292
Decided I just had
to look after number one.

579
01:11:11,254 --> 01:11:15,055
Now, I never
told anyone that before.

580
01:11:15,255 --> 01:11:16,722
But I reckon you
should think about it, Jay,

581
01:11:16,922 --> 01:11:21,825
'cause one day you might wake up
and find yourself lonely

582
01:11:22,025 --> 01:11:24,786
and old and poor,

583
01:11:24,986 --> 01:11:28,254
with nothin' to keep
you company but the flies

584
01:11:28,454 --> 01:11:30,453
'cause you left
the door half open.

585
01:11:32,618 --> 01:11:34,853
Now, here we are
being civilized

586
01:11:35,053 --> 01:11:36,752
to one another,

587
01:11:36,753 --> 01:11:37,952
but you and I both know

588
01:11:38,152 --> 01:11:40,419
things are gonna
change sooner or later.

589
01:11:41,317 --> 01:11:43,818
Don't get me wrong.

590
01:11:44,018 --> 01:11:46,519
I like you, Jay.

591
01:11:47,416 --> 01:11:49,217
Just don't take it personal

592
01:11:49,218 --> 01:11:52,252
when things turn
from ripe to rotten.

593
01:11:52,452 --> 01:11:55,752
'Cause that's how life is, Jay.

594
01:11:58,849 --> 01:12:00,716
Drive carefully.

595
01:12:30,646 --> 01:12:34,115
They bitin'?
Not like they used to.

596
01:12:34,315 --> 01:12:37,514
Nah, it's a shame.

597
01:12:43,411 --> 01:12:45,862
Aren't you gonna count it?

598
01:12:46,062 --> 01:12:48,311
No, I trust you.

599
01:12:48,511 --> 01:12:50,811
You shouldn't, ya know.

600
01:12:51,011 --> 01:12:55,313
You know that black cop's
been talkin' to Maria?

601
01:12:55,513 --> 01:13:00,079
Yeah, I know.
What he say?

602
01:13:00,279 --> 01:13:01,910
Nothin' much.

603
01:13:02,110 --> 01:13:05,109
It was more
the way he said it.

604
01:13:05,309 --> 01:13:07,475
He's trying to get
something out of you.

605
01:13:07,675 --> 01:13:13,479
Well, you won't have
to worry about him anymore.

606
01:13:13,679 --> 01:13:15,677
What you gonna
do about Maria?

607
01:13:15,877 --> 01:13:17,875
What do you
want me to do?

608
01:13:18,075 --> 01:13:19,809
Keep her mouth shut.

609
01:13:22,273 --> 01:13:24,207
You're doin'
the right thing.

610
01:13:24,208 --> 01:13:26,075
The past is the past.

611
01:13:26,275 --> 01:13:28,542
It's time for your people
to move on.

612
01:13:30,139 --> 01:13:31,873
Tommy?

613
01:13:33,138 --> 01:13:35,439
Are we right?

614
01:14:23,733 --> 01:14:25,433
What do you want?

615
01:14:26,567 --> 01:14:27,634
The passport.

616
01:14:29,666 --> 01:14:32,168
I just wanna know
where you found it.

617
01:14:33,499 --> 01:14:35,167
I don't want any trouble.

618
01:14:36,865 --> 01:14:40,635
If you just show me
where you found the passport,

619
01:14:40,835 --> 01:14:43,200
I'll leave you alone,
I promise.

620
01:14:52,097 --> 01:14:53,698
Up there.

621
01:14:53,898 --> 01:14:57,199
I was scratching around
and come across it by accident.

622
01:14:57,399 --> 01:14:59,097
You find anything else up there?

623
01:14:59,297 --> 01:15:01,564
Just rubbish. Fool's gold.

624
01:15:03,029 --> 01:15:07,199
Seen some fuckin' bikies
'round here, shootin'.

625
01:15:07,399 --> 01:15:09,429
Shootin' what?
At wild dogs.

626
01:15:09,629 --> 01:15:11,629
Anything that fuckin'
moves or doesn't move.

627
01:15:11,630 --> 01:15:16,633
They even fuckin' shot up
me fuckin' mail box. Twice.

628
01:15:19,094 --> 01:15:20,394
Where'd they come from?

629
01:15:20,594 --> 01:15:24,229
Where do you
think they come from?

630
01:15:24,429 --> 01:15:27,396
Fuckin' Furnace fuckin' Creek.

631
01:18:10,109 --> 01:18:13,376
Mrs. Lao?
Yes?

632
01:18:13,576 --> 01:18:15,610
That's a lot of noodles
you've got there.

633
01:18:15,810 --> 01:18:16,909
Can I help you?

634
01:18:16,910 --> 01:18:18,643
Yeah, I was hoping I could
ask you a few questions.

635
01:18:18,843 --> 01:18:22,512
Sorry, I'm very busy.
Yeah, no worries. Won't take long.

636
01:18:24,875 --> 01:18:28,277
Did you ever have a girl out
there by the name of Zhang Mei?

637
01:18:29,374 --> 01:18:31,208
I can't remember.

638
01:18:31,408 --> 01:18:32,708
You sure?

639
01:18:34,240 --> 01:18:39,407
What do you want?
The truth.

640
01:18:39,607 --> 01:18:42,107
What's really
going on out there?

641
01:18:44,205 --> 01:18:46,106
What's always
been going on.

642
01:19:04,137 --> 01:19:05,871
Tommy.

643
01:19:08,803 --> 01:19:10,570
Tommy.

644
01:19:12,802 --> 01:19:14,803
You all right?

645
01:19:17,602 --> 01:19:21,271
What do you
wanna do, Tommy?

646
01:19:23,168 --> 01:19:26,637
I wanna clean the dust away.

647
01:19:26,837 --> 01:19:28,368
Make it shine again.

648
01:19:35,733 --> 01:19:37,801
I wanna make a statement.

649
01:19:47,532 --> 01:19:49,933
How long's this
been goin' on?

650
01:19:50,133 --> 01:19:53,033
You gotta sign the papers,
film people...

651
01:19:53,233 --> 01:19:54,666
Tommy, how much?

652
01:19:54,866 --> 01:19:58,300
The man, he wants some money
if you don't sign the paper...

653
01:20:03,663 --> 01:20:07,666
Tommy, what happened
with old Jimmy?

654
01:20:18,596 --> 01:20:21,564
I grab him
and I put the rope around him,

655
01:20:21,764 --> 01:20:24,797
took him,
and I lift him up.

656
01:20:30,594 --> 01:20:32,128
All right.

657
01:22:07,817 --> 01:22:08,851
Hey, Josh.

658
01:22:10,050 --> 01:22:11,183
I want to see the girls.

659
01:22:11,383 --> 01:22:13,384
They're not here.
What do you mean

660
01:22:13,584 --> 01:22:15,350
they're not here?
Bring the fuckin' girls out.

661
01:22:15,550 --> 01:22:17,584
What are you
doin' here, Josh?

662
01:22:28,581 --> 01:22:32,217
Where are they? What's wrong with you?
You know the rules.

663
01:22:32,417 --> 01:22:34,015
When's the next plane?

664
01:22:34,215 --> 01:22:36,281
Mayor's not going
to be happy about this.

665
01:24:35,868 --> 01:24:37,035
You okay there, Maureen?

666
01:24:37,235 --> 01:24:41,070
Josh,
you gave me a fright.

667
01:24:41,867 --> 01:24:43,334
You working on a Sunday?

668
01:24:44,201 --> 01:24:46,567
Yeah, just...

669
01:24:46,767 --> 01:24:48,734
tying up a few loose ends.

670
01:24:48,735 --> 01:24:50,234
What can I do for you, Josh?

671
01:24:50,434 --> 01:24:53,267
Well, Maureen,
I'll just get right to it.

672
01:24:53,467 --> 01:24:56,301
I know you're involved
in old Jimmy's death.

673
01:24:56,501 --> 01:24:58,366
You realize
what you're sayin', Josh?

674
01:24:58,566 --> 01:25:01,333
Cut the bullshit, Maureen.
Your hands are all over it

675
01:25:01,533 --> 01:25:02,666
and I can prove it.

676
01:25:02,866 --> 01:25:04,766
Just like I can prove
you've been on the take

677
01:25:04,966 --> 01:25:05,798
with Furnace Creek.

678
01:25:05,998 --> 01:25:07,681
Josh, I'm just an old woman

679
01:25:07,881 --> 01:25:09,565
who likes to bake pies.

680
01:25:09,566 --> 01:25:12,767
I've got 12 sponsor kids,
for Christ's sake.

681
01:25:14,130 --> 01:25:16,865
Whoever's got the girls,
I wanna meet 'em.

682
01:25:17,065 --> 01:25:18,330
And I wanna meet 'em now.

683
01:25:21,096 --> 01:25:23,730
Which girls?
Don't fuck with me, Maureen.

684
01:25:23,930 --> 01:25:28,299
Josh, I don't know what's gotten into you.
You're not yourself.

685
01:25:28,499 --> 01:25:30,363
I need you to set it up.

686
01:25:32,495 --> 01:25:36,612
How much do you
think your life's worth?

687
01:25:36,812 --> 01:25:40,729
There's billions
of dollars out there.

688
01:25:40,929 --> 01:25:44,997
How do you think that compares with an
old blackfella or a lone Asian girl?

689
01:25:45,197 --> 01:25:47,760
A prostitute,
for Christ's sake.

690
01:25:47,960 --> 01:25:52,326
But I guess that's
just your style, isn't it?

691
01:25:52,526 --> 01:25:55,994
A copper who prefers to spend
his time with working girls.

692
01:25:56,194 --> 01:25:59,829
Not a good look for a young cop who
wants to step up in the world, is it?

693
01:26:01,092 --> 01:26:02,359
And those hands of yours,

694
01:26:02,559 --> 01:26:05,792
they may not be
as dipped as some,

695
01:26:05,992 --> 01:26:09,992
but they're not squeaky
clean either, are they, Josh?

696
01:26:10,192 --> 01:26:15,628
You set it up, or I'll get the fuckin'
Feds up here tomorrow.

697
01:26:20,123 --> 01:26:21,423
I'll need some bait.

698
01:26:21,424 --> 01:26:23,024
Tell 'em I want in.

699
01:26:23,224 --> 01:26:26,140
Do you really
want in, Josh?

700
01:26:26,340 --> 01:26:29,257
Your own big slice
of the pie?

701
01:26:29,457 --> 01:26:30,889
Make the call.

702
01:26:31,089 --> 01:26:32,522
Or I will.

703
01:28:53,740 --> 01:28:55,441
Josh.

704
01:28:56,306 --> 01:28:58,641
What's goin' on?

705
01:28:59,605 --> 01:29:01,473
You tell me
what's goin' on.

706
01:29:04,305 --> 01:29:06,106
One sec.

707
01:29:27,036 --> 01:29:28,737
Can you do something
for us, mate?

708
01:29:30,103 --> 01:29:31,203
Yeah, what's that, mate?

709
01:29:31,403 --> 01:29:33,270
Just grab that
shovel over there.

710
01:29:33,470 --> 01:29:35,036
Make yourself useful.

711
01:29:39,535 --> 01:29:41,569
Don't.

712
01:29:52,733 --> 01:29:54,534
Let's go.

713
01:30:37,829 --> 01:30:41,965
You wanna get close,
this is how you do it.

714
01:30:42,165 --> 01:30:44,430
Make it nice
and fuckin' big.

715
01:30:44,630 --> 01:30:46,763
Nothin' personal, Joshy.

716
01:30:48,094 --> 01:30:49,728
Just business.

717
01:31:09,693 --> 01:31:11,360
Hands on your head.

718
01:31:31,690 --> 01:31:33,524
Ah!

719
01:31:36,023 --> 01:31:37,656
Ahh!

720
01:32:41,249 --> 01:32:42,716
Are you sure you wanna do this?

721
01:35:27,264 --> 01:35:28,464
Ahh!

722
01:35:32,697 --> 01:35:34,497
Where are they?

723
01:35:34,697 --> 01:35:36,297
Who?
The girls.

724
01:35:36,497 --> 01:35:38,097
The laundry.

725
01:36:45,489 --> 01:36:47,422
Get on the ground!
Get on the ground now!

726
01:36:47,622 --> 01:36:49,556
On the ground!
On the fuckin' ground!

727
01:40:41,464 --> 01:40:43,565
Mayor's left town
without a trace.

728
01:40:44,896 --> 01:40:46,697
No sign of her yet.

729
01:40:48,262 --> 01:40:49,963
But you're free to go.

730
01:40:50,163 --> 01:40:52,263
The Feds have
taken over everything.

731
01:40:54,762 --> 01:40:57,998
It's all gone down
to the city with the girls.

732
01:40:58,198 --> 01:41:00,529
I'm just waiting
to see what happens.

733
01:41:12,693 --> 01:41:16,096
End up seeing any of them
wild dogs gettin' around?

734
01:41:18,460 --> 01:41:21,627
I seen somethin' out there,

735
01:41:21,827 --> 01:41:24,794
but I'm not sure what it was.

736
01:41:24,994 --> 01:41:27,361
But I do know it
was no bad thing.

737
01:41:31,225 --> 01:41:34,227
You know, growin' up
out here in the bush,

738
01:41:34,427 --> 01:41:36,892
I wouldn't
change it for anything.

739
01:41:37,092 --> 01:41:39,259
And I mean anything.

740
01:41:39,459 --> 01:41:44,328
But sometimes I can't help
but get this feelin' that...

741
01:41:47,657 --> 01:41:50,392
I coulda been...

742
01:41:51,556 --> 01:41:54,091
or I shoulda been...

743
01:41:54,291 --> 01:42:00,495
somethin' more than...
what I turned out.

744
01:42:02,222 --> 01:42:05,358
I tell myself not to listen.

745
01:42:06,154 --> 01:42:09,088
It's just this...

746
01:42:09,288 --> 01:42:12,223
small piece inside...

747
01:42:15,320 --> 01:42:18,222
that's cryin' out to be me.

748
01:42:23,786 --> 01:42:25,687
I'm gonna put in for a transfer.

749
01:42:28,952 --> 01:42:31,953
Somewhere by the ocean.

750
01:42:32,153 --> 01:42:35,521
Need to clean a bit
of this dust out of me, Jay.

751
01:42:37,884 --> 01:42:39,484
What about you?

752
01:42:39,684 --> 01:42:41,285
You headin' home?

753
01:42:49,250 --> 01:42:51,185
I guess.
