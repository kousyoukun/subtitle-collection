1
00:02:26,579 --> 00:02:28,547
Driver's license?

2
00:02:38,691 --> 00:02:42,494
You know you was
ten ks over back there?

3
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:48,567
Where you headed?

4
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:52,204
Been drinking today?

5
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,507
No worries.

6
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:58,544
Just need you to blow into this.

7
00:03:02,483 --> 00:03:05,684
Keep going. Yep.

8
00:03:11,724 --> 00:03:13,725
Step out of the car, please.

9
00:03:16,496 --> 00:03:18,864
I said step out of the car.

10
00:05:19,952 --> 00:05:22,187
Hey!

11
00:05:22,189 --> 00:05:25,023
Hey, fellas,
you wanna settle down there?

12
00:05:25,025 --> 00:05:28,293
Oi! You mob!

13
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:13,205
Morning, mayor.
Sally.

14
00:06:13,207 --> 00:06:15,340
Usual?
Thanks.

15
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:20,512
Morning, Josh.
Maureen.

16
00:06:20,514 --> 00:06:24,606
Heard there was a bit of silly
buggers down here last night.

17
00:06:24,631 --> 00:06:26,618
Nothing too serious, I hope.

18
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:28,019
Just the usual.

19
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:31,590
How're you going?
Oh, I'm keeping busy.

20
00:06:31,592 --> 00:06:36,495
There's... just shit going on with
the blackfellas out at broken river.

21
00:06:36,497 --> 00:06:39,431
You know, they're drinking,
fighting, whatnot. So...

22
00:06:39,433 --> 00:06:41,466
I've got enough to keep me
in and out of trouble.

23
00:06:41,468 --> 00:06:43,568
I bet you do.

24
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:49,541
Josh, there's something I've
been meaning to let you in on.

25
00:06:49,543 --> 00:06:53,612
Furnace creek's applied
for a new expansion license.

26
00:06:53,614 --> 00:06:55,847
For where?
Everywhere, just about.

27
00:06:55,849 --> 00:06:58,016
Well, the whole
Goldstone catchment, anyway.

28
00:06:58,018 --> 00:07:00,318
Fuck, that's bloody big.
Top you up, Josh?

29
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,821
Yeah. Thanks, Sally.

30
00:07:04,223 --> 00:07:06,958
Yeah, it's a very big deal
for all of us,

31
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,728
and I mean all of us.
But it's complicated.

32
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:13,965
Needs blackfella approval, and
there's a mile of bright red tape.

33
00:07:13,967 --> 00:07:16,134
What do you want from me?

34
00:07:16,136 --> 00:07:19,704
Well, I know you don't like
to get too involved in things,

35
00:07:19,706 --> 00:07:21,506
but just keep your eyes
and ears open,

36
00:07:21,508 --> 00:07:27,212
and if you feel any heat, especially
from broken river, let me know.

37
00:07:27,214 --> 00:07:30,549
We got Tommy from the
land council on our side,

38
00:07:30,551 --> 00:07:34,853
but we don't want anyone
further complicating things.

39
00:07:34,855 --> 00:07:38,957
Yeah, no worries.
Good.

40
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:41,526
Also, you might want to know.

41
00:07:41,528 --> 00:07:45,197
A stranger blew into town last night.
A detective.

42
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:48,633
And get this.
He's a blackfella.

43
00:07:48,635 --> 00:07:51,002
What, Indian black
or African black?

44
00:07:51,004 --> 00:07:53,071
No, I mean blackfella black.

45
00:07:53,073 --> 00:07:55,407
Near as I could tell, anyhow.

46
00:07:55,409 --> 00:07:59,244
What's he doing here?
Ain't too sure yet.

47
00:07:59,246 --> 00:08:00,879
Well, find out.

48
00:08:02,248 --> 00:08:04,049
Hey.

49
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:10,288
Apple?
'Course.

50
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:14,526
And Josh? Remember.

51
00:08:16,863 --> 00:08:18,530
No worries.

52
00:09:39,812 --> 00:09:44,382
Mmm. Mmm. Yeah, I know. What are
we payin' em a fortune for?

53
00:09:44,384 --> 00:09:48,920
We should have had a contract
two fuckin' weeks ago.

54
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:53,024
Look, if this thing falls through,
blame the fuckin' lawyers.

55
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:57,996
No, I'm just saying if it did.

56
00:09:57,998 --> 00:10:01,600
Okay. Okay.

57
00:10:01,602 --> 00:10:04,903
Gidday, Josh.
Johnny.

58
00:10:04,905 --> 00:10:08,073
You want a soft drink? Beer?
No. No, thanks.

59
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:13,144
Jeez, I hope the boys
weren't too much trouble.

60
00:10:13,146 --> 00:10:16,314
I've pretty well
had a gutful at this point.

61
00:10:16,316 --> 00:10:18,183
Yeah, no,
you know what they're like.

62
00:10:18,185 --> 00:10:19,818
Look, I don't have
the time for it anymore,

63
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:22,354
so if you can't fix it,

64
00:10:22,356 --> 00:10:25,390
I'll have
to start charging people.

65
00:10:25,392 --> 00:10:27,659
Come on, Josh. Mate,
you know as good as anyone

66
00:10:27,661 --> 00:10:33,531
with no mine, there is no pub, there's
no Josh, there's no fuckin' Goldstone.

67
00:10:33,533 --> 00:10:36,868
Without furnace creek,
we'd be a bloody piss stop

68
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:39,971
on the highway to nowhere.

69
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:43,041
You know, just like when
the blackfellas were in charge.

70
00:10:46,779 --> 00:10:52,384
You... you heard
of the new expansion license?

71
00:10:55,855 --> 00:10:59,724
Look, you've always
been a good supporter, Josh.

72
00:10:59,726 --> 00:11:03,762
You know, always been
looking for ways

73
00:11:03,764 --> 00:11:05,497
to show my appreciation.

74
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:11,803
But this one's
major league, mate.

75
00:11:11,805 --> 00:11:15,106
We're talking
a few hundred million dollars

76
00:11:15,108 --> 00:11:17,776
worth of gold, probably more.

77
00:11:23,749 --> 00:11:27,018
I just need to know
if we can count on ya.

78
00:11:28,621 --> 00:11:30,588
Looks like a lot
of trees there, Johnny.

79
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:34,125
Oh, mate,
that's just for starters.

80
00:11:37,229 --> 00:11:41,833
How about... how about
I look after it for ya

81
00:11:41,835 --> 00:11:45,170
since it's, you know,
it's your first time and all.

82
00:11:46,439 --> 00:11:48,640
Look, I better get back to it.

83
00:11:50,643 --> 00:11:56,314
All right. Yeah. You have a good one, eh?
Yeah, you too.

84
00:12:23,008 --> 00:12:24,342
Hey, old man.

85
00:12:26,278 --> 00:12:28,780
I was looking for Maria.

86
00:12:39,892 --> 00:12:41,326
Maria.

87
00:12:49,201 --> 00:12:51,603
Who are you?

88
00:12:51,605 --> 00:12:54,072
My name's Jay.

89
00:12:54,074 --> 00:12:55,907
About six months ago,

90
00:12:55,909 --> 00:12:59,344
your phone was used
to call a police hotline.

91
00:12:59,346 --> 00:13:02,413
It was about an Asian-looking
girl in the desert.

92
00:13:02,415 --> 00:13:05,450
Did you make the call?

93
00:13:09,155 --> 00:13:10,555
And is this her?

94
00:13:17,163 --> 00:13:20,031
Could be.

95
00:13:20,033 --> 00:13:21,800
Where'd you see her?

96
00:13:23,502 --> 00:13:28,540
Under that first tree,
heading out to town.

97
00:13:28,542 --> 00:13:33,545
And what was she doing?
Sittin' in the shade.

98
00:13:33,547 --> 00:13:35,747
Did she look
like she needed help?

99
00:13:49,061 --> 00:13:50,495
Who's that?

100
00:13:54,934 --> 00:13:57,235
Oh, that's Tommy.

101
00:13:57,237 --> 00:14:00,738
Big land council boss.

102
00:15:36,436 --> 00:15:38,703
Yeah, what?

103
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:45,043
Well, fuckin' deal with it.

104
00:15:45,045 --> 00:15:49,047
Well, get onto Josh. Ask if
he knows anything about him.

105
00:15:49,049 --> 00:15:53,551
Right?

106
00:17:00,552 --> 00:17:03,921
Good evening, sir.

107
00:17:03,923 --> 00:17:05,623
Please, sit down.

108
00:17:11,964 --> 00:17:14,999
I'm Anne,
but you can call me pinky.

109
00:17:16,935 --> 00:17:21,572
How long you been in town, pinky?
A few days.

110
00:17:21,574 --> 00:17:26,644
I cruise in for a few weeks and then
I cruise out, just like you guys.

111
00:17:26,646 --> 00:17:31,416
Are you married?
Not anymore.

112
00:17:31,418 --> 00:17:36,187
I hear ya. Got kids?

113
00:17:36,189 --> 00:17:37,889
A beautiful girl.

114
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:44,562
Yeah, she passed away last year.

115
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:48,866
I'm sorry.

116
00:17:51,136 --> 00:17:55,773
Are you a single girl, pinky?
Yeah, most of the time.

117
00:17:55,775 --> 00:18:01,112
You hear of things
happening out here?

118
00:18:02,347 --> 00:18:03,915
Are you a cop?

119
00:18:06,552 --> 00:18:08,052
Sometimes.

120
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:14,092
I've heard... stories

121
00:18:14,094 --> 00:18:16,694
about girls getting
caught up in stuff.

122
00:18:16,696 --> 00:18:20,932
But you should know by now that
all roads lead to furnace creek.

123
00:18:20,934 --> 00:18:23,301
There's nothing else out here.

124
00:18:23,303 --> 00:18:27,238
I do know one thing for sure,

125
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:31,442
and that's this land
ain't no place for a young girl.

126
00:18:50,329 --> 00:18:52,497
I'll be gentle.

127
00:18:52,499 --> 00:18:54,765
Maybe next time.

128
00:18:57,269 --> 00:18:59,871
There is...

129
00:18:59,873 --> 00:19:01,906
No...

130
00:19:01,908 --> 00:19:05,943
Next... time.

131
00:19:48,287 --> 00:19:50,254
Fuck!

132
00:20:14,313 --> 00:20:18,950
Jeez, you don't
mess around, do ya?

133
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:32,930
Sgs.

134
00:20:34,466 --> 00:20:36,667
They meant business.

135
00:20:39,538 --> 00:20:41,105
You wanna make a statement?

136
00:20:42,941 --> 00:20:45,810
Are you gonna tell me
what you're doin' out here?

137
00:20:45,812 --> 00:20:48,613
I know you ain't
out here on no holiday.

138
00:20:50,449 --> 00:20:52,683
Who sent ya?

139
00:20:56,054 --> 00:20:57,622
Missing persons.

140
00:21:06,031 --> 00:21:10,534
Well... I'm gonna tell ya now,

141
00:21:10,536 --> 00:21:14,238
there must be some mistake.

142
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:17,942
We got no missing
persons out here.

143
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:23,614
Seems to me like
a big old waste of time.

144
00:21:23,616 --> 00:21:25,983
You should probably just

145
00:21:25,985 --> 00:21:29,654
turn that old rust
bucket of yours around and...

146
00:21:29,656 --> 00:21:31,289
Head back
to where you came from.

147
00:21:37,696 --> 00:21:39,764
That's for you.

148
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,704
From the region commander.

149
00:21:46,706 --> 00:21:50,574
You wanna argue about it, you can give
'em a call and you can sort it out.

150
00:21:50,576 --> 00:21:54,045
But I'm guessing you don't want
any extra attention out here.

151
00:22:00,786 --> 00:22:02,820
Well, I can tell you now

152
00:22:02,822 --> 00:22:08,392
I ain't got time to be anybody's
cattle dog, especially yours.

153
00:22:08,394 --> 00:22:10,828
Anyway...

154
00:22:12,798 --> 00:22:15,933
Old Ruby rose,
she's as mad as hell.

155
00:22:15,935 --> 00:22:18,602
Wants you out of here
quick as a snail's fart.

156
00:22:18,604 --> 00:22:21,806
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

157
00:22:21,808 --> 00:22:24,175
Best get packin'.

158
00:22:43,662 --> 00:22:46,497
It's all off-grid.

159
00:22:46,499 --> 00:22:48,132
Gas fridge and stove.

160
00:22:54,306 --> 00:22:59,910
It's a bit rough,
but should be quiet enough.

161
00:22:59,912 --> 00:23:02,179
What's the old Winchester for?

162
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:07,284
Mostly wild dogs.

163
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:11,889
And whatever else
comes out of the desert.

164
00:23:11,891 --> 00:23:14,058
Ferals around here

165
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:18,829
have been mixing
with the dingos.

166
00:23:18,831 --> 00:23:23,300
Making some crazy half-breed.

167
00:23:23,302 --> 00:23:26,237
Wilder than the purebreds.

168
00:23:26,239 --> 00:23:27,805
Twice as cunning.

169
00:23:32,377 --> 00:23:34,779
Just a word of warning.

170
00:23:36,615 --> 00:23:38,015
You see, out here...

171
00:23:38,017 --> 00:23:41,986
Folks don't take
too kindly to outsiders.

172
00:23:43,455 --> 00:23:46,957
So if you do want
to go lookin' around,

173
00:23:46,959 --> 00:23:49,427
just be careful where you step.

174
00:23:50,862 --> 00:23:52,797
There's plenty of snakes about.

175
00:26:44,903 --> 00:26:47,037
Take your hands off your gun!

176
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:48,672
Take your hands
off your fucking gun!

177
00:26:48,674 --> 00:26:49,907
Now drop to your knees slowly!

178
00:26:49,909 --> 00:26:51,375
Put your hands on your head.

179
00:26:51,377 --> 00:26:53,377
Put your hands
on your fuckin' head!

180
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:49,767
Go.

181
00:28:02,213 --> 00:28:04,048
How're ya goin'?

182
00:28:04,050 --> 00:28:06,216
You can call me Johnny.

183
00:28:08,286 --> 00:28:10,988
Can I get you
a cold refreshment?

184
00:28:10,990 --> 00:28:13,624
You want a soft drink? Beer?

185
00:28:18,663 --> 00:28:23,967
Do you realize you were... intercepted
well within a restricted area?

186
00:28:23,969 --> 00:28:29,039
You know, it's a fuckin'
dangerous worksite out here.

187
00:28:29,041 --> 00:28:31,208
You know,
you could have been injured.

188
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:33,644
Well, even worse than that.

189
00:28:33,646 --> 00:28:39,516
What were you doing out here?
I just got lost.

190
00:28:45,957 --> 00:28:49,793
You get lost much, detective?

191
00:28:54,132 --> 00:28:57,134
And what'd you
see out there tonight?

192
00:29:00,238 --> 00:29:02,172
A beautiful sunset.

193
00:29:02,174 --> 00:29:06,443
Oh, beautiful sunset, yeah.

194
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:18,021
You might wear a badge,
work for the crown.

195
00:29:18,023 --> 00:29:20,090
So do we.

196
00:29:20,092 --> 00:29:22,860
The difference is that

197
00:29:22,862 --> 00:29:26,396
we keep this country
in business.

198
00:29:26,398 --> 00:29:29,199
See, it's all about...

199
00:29:29,201 --> 00:29:31,468
It's all about standards
of living, you know?

200
00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:37,641
We can't stop the wheel turning
for anyone, including you.

201
00:29:38,743 --> 00:29:41,178
So I suggest...

202
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:44,948
I suggest that you...
You get on your horse

203
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:48,819
and ya fuckin' ride
out of here while ya can.

204
00:29:50,121 --> 00:29:51,722
Go on.

205
00:29:51,724 --> 00:29:54,224
Drive safe, though.

206
00:29:54,226 --> 00:29:56,860
Drive safe.

207
00:30:07,472 --> 00:30:09,273
Hooroo.

208
00:30:46,911 --> 00:30:49,379
Mayor's invited you
to morning tea.

209
00:30:52,116 --> 00:30:54,284
She'll be expecting ya.

210
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:05,429
What were you doing out
at furnace creek last night?

211
00:31:05,431 --> 00:31:09,566
You just can't go
wanderin' round like that.

212
00:31:09,568 --> 00:31:11,768
You cross the border
at furnace creek, copper or not,

213
00:31:11,770 --> 00:31:13,770
they got their
rights to kill ya.

214
00:31:17,375 --> 00:31:19,877
You know what goes on out there?

215
00:31:19,879 --> 00:31:22,246
What are you talking about?

216
00:31:22,248 --> 00:31:24,815
Talking about a plane
full of Asian girls.

217
00:31:28,152 --> 00:31:29,853
It's all done off-site.

218
00:31:29,855 --> 00:31:33,257
They fly in, they fly out.
It's all legal.

219
00:31:33,259 --> 00:31:36,393
You heard of trafficking?

220
00:31:38,229 --> 00:31:39,830
Jesus, Jay.

221
00:31:39,832 --> 00:31:42,332
Well, how do you know
they're not being trafficked?

222
00:31:42,334 --> 00:31:43,934
How do you know they are?

223
00:31:49,073 --> 00:31:51,575
Don't make no difference.

224
00:31:53,211 --> 00:31:56,914
That kind of shit
ain't my watch.

225
00:31:56,916 --> 00:31:58,615
Belongs to the feds.

226
00:31:58,617 --> 00:32:01,518
Do you know where
they keep the girls?

227
00:32:03,321 --> 00:32:05,088
That ain't your concern.

228
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:09,393
And why ain't it yours?

229
00:32:09,395 --> 00:32:12,195
You on the take?

230
00:32:12,197 --> 00:32:13,897
Part of the security team?

231
00:32:17,936 --> 00:32:19,870
What?

232
00:32:23,274 --> 00:32:25,943
You calling me dirty there, Jay?

233
00:32:28,446 --> 00:32:30,881
That what you're doin'?

234
00:32:30,883 --> 00:32:32,950
Callin' me dirty?

235
00:32:32,952 --> 00:32:35,719
Who's letting the grog
into broken river?

236
00:32:35,721 --> 00:32:39,723
It's a dry community
and it's soaking with piss.

237
00:32:39,725 --> 00:32:42,793
And it's on your watch.

238
00:32:42,795 --> 00:32:46,964
Askin' or callin',
whatever you want it to be.

239
00:33:17,695 --> 00:33:20,931
Brother boy.
Where you from?

240
00:33:23,034 --> 00:33:24,534
Oh, here and there.

241
00:33:25,970 --> 00:33:27,971
What were you
doing up at broken river?

242
00:33:29,974 --> 00:33:31,842
Just lookin' around.

243
00:33:33,444 --> 00:33:37,481
Well, you see,
we got protocols out here.

244
00:33:37,483 --> 00:33:41,084
This is not your country
to go walkin' around on.

245
00:33:41,086 --> 00:33:44,421
You're a guest here.

246
00:33:44,423 --> 00:33:48,291
Just like the white man.

247
00:33:48,293 --> 00:33:51,128
You understand, brother boy?

248
00:34:09,547 --> 00:34:13,850
Mr. swan. Come on in.

249
00:34:13,852 --> 00:34:14,951
Sit down.

250
00:34:18,122 --> 00:34:21,625
You can call me Maureen.

251
00:34:23,528 --> 00:34:24,928
Milk and sugar?

252
00:34:28,599 --> 00:34:32,335
Now, Mr. swan...
Jay, isn't it?

253
00:34:32,337 --> 00:34:34,604
I'm going to call you Jay.

254
00:34:34,606 --> 00:34:38,341
I heard something
about a missing person.

255
00:34:38,343 --> 00:34:42,579
You see, there's not much
I don't know about

256
00:34:42,581 --> 00:34:44,581
when it comes to Goldstone.

257
00:34:46,217 --> 00:34:49,319
Now, out here, Jay,

258
00:34:49,321 --> 00:34:52,155
we run a very tight ship,

259
00:34:52,157 --> 00:34:57,094
where even the smallest stones
can cause mighty big ripples.

260
00:34:57,096 --> 00:35:00,797
And we don't take
too kindly to mob who come in

261
00:35:00,799 --> 00:35:03,467
and throw stones with no reason.

262
00:35:03,469 --> 00:35:06,269
Young Josh is a good boy.

263
00:35:06,271 --> 00:35:11,741
Took him a while, but he
understands how this place works.

264
00:35:11,743 --> 00:35:15,946
So I suggest you keep
your head down,

265
00:35:15,948 --> 00:35:18,048
keep those waters
nice and still.

266
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:21,118
Yeah?

267
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:25,622
Oh, and this is for you.

268
00:35:28,559 --> 00:35:30,894
I was planning
to give you just one slice,

269
00:35:30,896 --> 00:35:32,629
but I thought, what the hell.

270
00:35:32,631 --> 00:35:35,365
Hope you got a sweet tooth.

271
00:35:35,367 --> 00:35:38,568
Thanks for the little chat.

272
00:35:38,570 --> 00:35:43,206
And if you need
anything, just ask.

273
00:35:43,208 --> 00:35:46,076
And I mean anything.

274
00:36:38,496 --> 00:36:41,765
Hey, Josh.
Gidday, Mick.

275
00:36:45,436 --> 00:36:49,406
Looking for a bit of love?
Oh, not tonight.

276
00:36:49,408 --> 00:36:51,908
Bit of business, actually.

277
00:36:51,910 --> 00:36:53,944
Oh, yeah, what kind of business?

278
00:36:53,946 --> 00:36:57,147
You got foreign
workers here, yeah?

279
00:36:57,149 --> 00:36:59,482
Yeah, like usual.

280
00:36:59,484 --> 00:37:02,018
They got work visas?

281
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:04,454
As far as I know.
Why, is there a problem?

282
00:37:04,456 --> 00:37:07,357
No, no, no.
No, just an inquiry.

283
00:37:07,359 --> 00:37:09,759
An inquiry?
Yeah.

284
00:37:09,761 --> 00:37:11,895
Yeah, I want to talk to 'em.

285
00:37:13,664 --> 00:37:16,233
What, now?
Yeah.

286
00:37:16,235 --> 00:37:18,568
Well, they're busy.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know.

287
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:20,203
Won't take long.

288
00:37:20,205 --> 00:37:22,405
You know, Josh,

289
00:37:22,407 --> 00:37:24,708
some people might
call this a raid.

290
00:37:24,710 --> 00:37:27,911
Come on, Mick,
it's not a big deal.

291
00:37:32,817 --> 00:37:37,153
Excuse us, Mick, Mrs. Lao.

292
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:48,698
You girls speak English?

293
00:37:54,839 --> 00:37:58,742
Are any of you girls
here against your will?

294
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:06,049
Has anybody threatened you
in any way?

295
00:38:12,157 --> 00:38:15,925
Are any of you being
forced to pay back money?

296
00:38:21,799 --> 00:38:23,800
Okay, thanks for your time.

297
00:38:31,575 --> 00:38:35,478
Today here we make history.

298
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:41,184
Today we guarantee
your community's security.

299
00:38:41,186 --> 00:38:43,186
We're talking
about infrastructure.

300
00:38:43,188 --> 00:38:46,256
We're talking jobs and training.

301
00:38:46,258 --> 00:38:51,394
Getting those lost kids off the
drugs and into full-time jobs.

302
00:38:51,396 --> 00:38:54,431
Look, I know some of you
mob are worried about your...

303
00:38:54,433 --> 00:38:58,068
Your sacred sites
and protecting your culture.

304
00:38:58,070 --> 00:39:01,604
But at furnace creek,
we pride ourselves

305
00:39:01,606 --> 00:39:06,676
on our environmental
and our cultural record.

306
00:39:06,678 --> 00:39:09,245
We hold our hands out

307
00:39:09,247 --> 00:39:14,284
to walk together down
this new pathway to the future

308
00:39:14,286 --> 00:39:19,956
with the approval of this
new exploration agreement.

309
00:39:19,958 --> 00:39:21,891
Let's just jump to it
and I'll invite

310
00:39:21,893 --> 00:39:25,061
the broken river
council board members

311
00:39:25,063 --> 00:39:29,466
to come up here to give their autographs of
approval in front of youse all here today.

312
00:39:29,468 --> 00:39:31,334
Thank you.

313
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:49,452
Jimmy.

314
00:39:50,721 --> 00:39:51,988
Jimmy!

315
00:40:23,687 --> 00:40:25,255
Hey, old man.

316
00:40:30,728 --> 00:40:32,762
You want a ride?

317
00:40:49,847 --> 00:40:55,118
Lookin' for that girl?
Chinese one, eh?

318
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:57,987
Yeah, you know something?

319
00:41:00,825 --> 00:41:04,360
My grandfather
saw first white man here.

320
00:41:04,362 --> 00:41:09,132
He come on a camel.
Then the Chinese men come.

321
00:41:09,134 --> 00:41:12,202
They said they all
look for the gold stone.

322
00:41:12,204 --> 00:41:16,739
And they follow the same god.

323
00:41:16,741 --> 00:41:18,842
Money god.

324
00:41:21,579 --> 00:41:24,981
I know why you came here.

325
00:41:24,983 --> 00:41:27,851
I know your face.

326
00:41:27,853 --> 00:41:30,186
Just like your father.

327
00:41:33,791 --> 00:41:35,124
What, you knew him?

328
00:41:35,126 --> 00:41:39,662
He be taken away
when he was a young boy.

329
00:41:39,664 --> 00:41:45,201
Then he came back a man
and he said he had a son.

330
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:52,075
Must be you.

331
00:41:55,514 --> 00:41:57,547
See that bird?

332
00:41:59,950 --> 00:42:02,018
You hit 'em with the car.

333
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:09,225
Next time you be careful.

334
00:42:09,227 --> 00:42:12,328
Look after him. Protect him.

335
00:42:12,330 --> 00:42:15,665
They need more time
to understand.

336
00:42:15,667 --> 00:42:20,236
But when you need him,
they save your life.

337
00:42:20,238 --> 00:42:22,071
They'll find the water,

338
00:42:22,073 --> 00:42:24,908
just the middle of nowhere,
in the desert.

339
00:42:24,910 --> 00:42:28,077
Clean water, too.

340
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:34,017
Yep. I show you something.
What?

341
00:42:34,019 --> 00:42:37,320
What you really come here for.

342
00:42:38,622 --> 00:42:40,323
Don't worry, not far.

343
00:42:42,826 --> 00:42:44,861
That way.

344
00:44:01,005 --> 00:44:02,705
Hey.

345
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:11,547
What's wrong?

346
00:44:13,550 --> 00:44:18,688
Well... I'm thinking
of gettin' out, Maureen.

347
00:44:19,957 --> 00:44:22,692
I'm thinking to quit
while I'm ahead.

348
00:44:22,694 --> 00:44:25,061
Quittin'?

349
00:44:25,063 --> 00:44:28,264
But Johnny, we're so close.

350
00:44:30,134 --> 00:44:32,468
Old Jimmy walked out
of the signing ceremony.

351
00:44:32,470 --> 00:44:37,340
What? Tommy told me there'd
be no problem with Jimmy.

352
00:44:37,342 --> 00:44:39,275
Yeah, well, he is.
He's a big fuckin' problem.

353
00:44:39,277 --> 00:44:42,945
Already told the suits down south
we've got the green light.

354
00:44:42,947 --> 00:44:44,380
Maybe he wants more money.

355
00:44:44,382 --> 00:44:45,715
I'll have a chat to Tommy.
No, no.

356
00:44:45,717 --> 00:44:47,417
He's the type you can't buy.

357
00:44:47,419 --> 00:44:50,119
You know,
he doesn't go to church.

358
00:44:50,121 --> 00:44:54,557
Hasn't touched a drop of the grog
we've been runnin' out there.

359
00:44:54,559 --> 00:44:57,160
The old ways are in his blood.

360
00:44:57,162 --> 00:44:59,462
Probably hold off
until he fuckin' dies.

361
00:45:01,465 --> 00:45:05,435
Maybe we could speed things up.

362
00:45:09,606 --> 00:45:11,641
What do you mean?

363
00:45:11,643 --> 00:45:13,676
You know what I mean.

364
00:45:15,846 --> 00:45:19,749
Fuckin' shit, no. No, no.

365
00:45:19,751 --> 00:45:25,655
Johnny, we got so much
at stake here, remember?

366
00:45:25,657 --> 00:45:28,257
Just leave it with me.

367
00:45:28,259 --> 00:45:31,260
I'll do everything.

368
00:45:31,262 --> 00:45:33,796
Okay? Okay, babe?

369
00:46:03,694 --> 00:46:07,130
Hey, Josh. Back again?

370
00:46:07,132 --> 00:46:08,898
Yeah, looks like it.

371
00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:13,503
Business or pleasure?
Pleasure.

372
00:47:03,654 --> 00:47:05,254
Where you from?

373
00:47:06,323 --> 00:47:10,359
A small town
a long way from here.

374
00:47:11,528 --> 00:47:13,563
You?

375
00:47:13,565 --> 00:47:16,866
A small town,
long way from here.

376
00:47:20,804 --> 00:47:22,572
What's your name?

377
00:47:24,041 --> 00:47:25,775
Mei.

378
00:47:27,211 --> 00:47:28,911
How'd you get here?

379
00:47:28,913 --> 00:47:32,281
It's a long story.

380
00:47:32,283 --> 00:47:35,318
It's okay.
You can trust me.

381
00:47:37,855 --> 00:47:39,722
You come here much?

382
00:47:41,992 --> 00:47:43,659
Sometimes.

383
00:47:44,862 --> 00:47:47,830
You don't look like
the others around here.

384
00:47:49,099 --> 00:47:50,766
How's that?

385
00:47:50,768 --> 00:47:54,237
You just look different.

386
00:47:54,239 --> 00:47:59,075
Nah, I'm just the same as them.

387
00:47:59,077 --> 00:48:01,878
Maybe I just didn't
start out that way, though.

388
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:04,247
How did you?

389
00:48:04,249 --> 00:48:07,250
I don't know.

390
00:48:08,952 --> 00:48:14,423
Didn't do things
the way other folks did.

391
00:48:14,425 --> 00:48:18,861
I didn't believe
what other folks believed.

392
00:48:18,863 --> 00:48:22,331
What did you believe?

393
00:48:22,333 --> 00:48:25,368
Doesn't matter.

394
00:48:28,238 --> 00:48:30,539
That boy's long gone.

395
00:48:35,479 --> 00:48:37,680
So why all the questions, Mei?

396
00:48:39,549 --> 00:48:42,818
So I don't have to answer yours.

397
00:48:42,820 --> 00:48:46,022
Clever girl.

398
00:48:48,325 --> 00:48:51,560
What do you really want,
Mr. policeman?

399
00:48:51,562 --> 00:48:55,097
Need to know what's
going on out here.

400
00:48:55,099 --> 00:48:57,433
What do you think is going on?

401
00:48:58,368 --> 00:49:01,404
Not too sure yet.

402
00:49:01,406 --> 00:49:03,940
The truth can be
hard to find out here,

403
00:49:03,942 --> 00:49:06,375
especially once
the sun goes down.

404
00:49:08,078 --> 00:49:11,547
And when you find the truth,

405
00:49:11,549 --> 00:49:14,917
what will you do about it?

406
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:04,266
- Yeah?
- <i>I got some information.</i>

407
00:50:04,268 --> 00:50:08,904
About what? <i>About what
the fuck's going on.</i>

408
00:50:08,906 --> 00:50:10,706
Who is this?

409
00:50:10,708 --> 00:50:14,043
<i>Meet me out
at shadow tree crossroads.</i>

410
00:52:27,978 --> 00:52:29,211
What happened?

411
00:52:29,213 --> 00:52:32,681
Looks like the old man
tanked himself.

412
00:52:33,884 --> 00:52:36,585
How do you know that?

413
00:52:36,587 --> 00:52:39,155
'Cause I know
what it looks like.

414
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:44,727
Except usually it's the kids.

415
00:52:44,729 --> 00:52:47,029
We had five in the last year.

416
00:52:51,769 --> 00:52:53,469
And I got a witness.

417
00:52:55,740 --> 00:52:59,909
Said he came here fishin'.

418
00:52:59,911 --> 00:53:01,777
Saw old Jimmy
swinging from the tree,

419
00:53:01,779 --> 00:53:04,647
but... it was too late.

420
00:53:08,451 --> 00:53:10,219
Sadly.

421
00:56:22,445 --> 00:56:24,413
Josh!

422
00:56:26,983 --> 00:56:29,218
Oh, hope I'm not interrupting.

423
00:56:29,220 --> 00:56:32,521
I was just heading home
and I saw the car.

424
00:56:32,523 --> 00:56:34,356
No, you're all right, Maureen.

425
00:56:34,358 --> 00:56:36,959
I just heard about Jimmy.

426
00:56:36,961 --> 00:56:39,995
Shame, takin' his
own life like that.

427
00:56:39,997 --> 00:56:44,566
Yeah, I know. I didn't
think he was the type.

428
00:56:44,568 --> 00:56:48,971
Oh, it's often the way it goes.
Ones you least expect.

429
00:56:48,973 --> 00:56:53,776
Yeah.
Is there a problem?

430
00:56:53,778 --> 00:56:57,813
No, no, just... just procedure.

431
00:56:57,815 --> 00:56:59,848
I record all
the suicides we get.

432
00:56:59,850 --> 00:57:02,718
Oh, good. I want to make
sure there's no problems

433
00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:07,256
for the family getting a release so
they can go ahead with the burial.

434
00:57:07,258 --> 00:57:11,160
Can be really painful,
dragging these things out.

435
00:57:11,162 --> 00:57:14,596
Yeah, no worries.
No worries, Maureen. I'll...

436
00:57:14,598 --> 00:57:17,599
I'll get Max over in the morning
and I'll dress the body.

437
00:57:17,601 --> 00:57:20,202
Should be ready by tomorrow afternoon.
Oh, good, Josh.

438
00:57:20,204 --> 00:57:22,137
Appreciate it.
No worries.

439
00:57:22,139 --> 00:57:25,607
Oh, there's one other thing...

440
00:57:25,609 --> 00:57:31,246
Don't ya reckon Mr. swan has
overstayed his welcome, eh?

441
00:57:32,382 --> 00:57:33,482
Yeah, I get your drift,

442
00:57:33,484 --> 00:57:36,285
but it might not be so easy.

443
00:57:36,287 --> 00:57:38,420
He's here on federal authority.

444
00:57:39,756 --> 00:57:41,924
Joshua.

445
00:57:41,926 --> 00:57:46,328
Since when were you afraid
of a little authority?

446
00:57:47,497 --> 00:57:49,498
Talk later.

447
00:58:53,363 --> 00:58:56,999
I want you out of here,
pure and simple.

448
00:58:58,968 --> 00:59:01,303
I did some checkin'.

449
00:59:01,305 --> 00:59:03,572
I know why you
got sent out here.

450
00:59:05,375 --> 00:59:07,409
Because of the hornet's nest
you set on fire

451
00:59:07,411 --> 00:59:09,244
back in your hometown.

452
00:59:09,246 --> 00:59:14,082
I've gotta admit,
lookin' at you now,

453
00:59:14,084 --> 00:59:16,451
I wouldn't have thought
you had it in ya.

454
00:59:17,921 --> 00:59:20,155
Five men ended...

455
00:59:21,591 --> 00:59:24,226
Pretty much single-handed.

456
00:59:25,995 --> 00:59:29,531
Jesus, you're
a dangerous man, Jay.

457
00:59:37,941 --> 00:59:42,110
I guess all that
blood on your hands...

458
00:59:42,112 --> 00:59:44,146
Send anyone to drink.

459
00:59:51,487 --> 00:59:53,388
Ya ever loved anyone?

460
00:59:55,058 --> 00:59:56,992
What do you reckon?

461
00:59:57,994 --> 00:59:59,127
I reckon you're too gutless

462
00:59:59,129 --> 01:00:02,097
to do a lot of things.

463
01:00:02,099 --> 01:00:05,334
It's probably one of 'em.

464
01:00:05,336 --> 01:00:08,270
Just end in a big
fuckin' mess anyway.

465
01:00:09,272 --> 01:00:12,240
I reckon I'll just bypass it.

466
01:00:12,242 --> 01:00:15,744
Yeah, why not bypass
the whole fuckin' thing?

467
01:00:15,746 --> 01:00:19,114
But you already thought
about that more than once.

468
01:00:19,116 --> 01:00:23,352
Pulling that Glock out of your holster
and popping it in your mouth.

469
01:00:23,354 --> 01:00:27,422
Out here, all on your lonesome.

470
01:00:28,424 --> 01:00:30,359
Fuck you, Jay.

471
01:00:32,161 --> 01:00:35,097
Fuckin' bypass.

472
01:00:35,099 --> 01:00:37,666
Like this whole fuckin' country.

473
01:00:42,472 --> 01:00:45,540
You think your missing girl's out
there, you go right on ahead.

474
01:00:45,542 --> 01:00:47,476
I won't stop ya.

475
01:00:47,478 --> 01:00:50,412
But you're chasin'
a fuckin' ghost, Jay.

476
01:00:52,982 --> 01:00:58,253
You got no witness
and you got no victim.

477
01:01:01,090 --> 01:01:02,691
No fuckin' crime.

478
01:01:08,097 --> 01:01:10,699
Belongs to the missing girl.

479
01:01:13,302 --> 01:01:15,037
Where'd you get it?
Doesn't matter.

480
01:01:15,039 --> 01:01:16,938
It's just a lost passport.

481
01:01:16,940 --> 01:01:19,508
Oh, it's just a lost passport.
What, just like an old man

482
01:01:19,510 --> 01:01:23,712
just killed himself...
On your watch.

483
01:01:38,027 --> 01:01:42,831
You think you or me or anyone can make
a difference to any fuckin' thing?

484
01:01:42,833 --> 01:01:48,036
Think you really cleaned up
that town of yours?

485
01:01:48,038 --> 01:01:50,405
You might have
stirred up a bit of dirt,

486
01:01:50,407 --> 01:01:52,674
but it's just a matter
of time that the dust settles.

487
01:01:52,676 --> 01:01:56,411
Well, at least
it's a little bit thinner.

488
01:01:58,781 --> 01:02:02,918
You go out there, guns blazing,
they'll probably kill ya.

489
01:02:02,920 --> 01:02:06,922
And all of this shit,
it'll just keep goin' round.

490
01:02:06,924 --> 01:02:10,792
And I'll be the one stuck on light
duties in some fuckin' hell hole.

491
01:02:13,362 --> 01:02:15,764
I thought you
were already there.

492
01:03:48,457 --> 01:03:51,793
Why did you come back?

493
01:03:51,795 --> 01:03:54,663
Still looking for the truth?

494
01:03:54,665 --> 01:03:56,198
Or something else?

495
01:03:58,201 --> 01:03:59,868
I don't know.

496
01:04:01,237 --> 01:04:07,142
Maybe... a lot of things.

497
01:04:07,144 --> 01:04:08,543
All at once.

498
01:04:15,151 --> 01:04:18,353
Why did you choose me
from the others?

499
01:04:20,690 --> 01:04:22,924
I guess something
just caught my eye.

500
01:04:25,127 --> 01:04:26,895
What something?

501
01:04:30,666 --> 01:04:35,503
You sure you are just
like the others, Mr. policeman?

502
01:04:37,173 --> 01:04:39,040
What are you really doin' here?

503
01:04:39,042 --> 01:04:41,443
What do you think?

504
01:04:42,612 --> 01:04:44,312
I think you're pretending.

505
01:04:44,314 --> 01:04:47,382
Pretending what?

506
01:04:47,384 --> 01:04:49,718
To be like the others.

507
01:04:49,720 --> 01:04:53,922
I do what they do.
Makes me no different.

508
01:04:55,258 --> 01:04:59,628
Just like you,
do like the others.

509
01:05:01,163 --> 01:05:02,864
Let me help you.

510
01:05:02,866 --> 01:05:06,501
Why do you think I need it?

511
01:05:06,503 --> 01:05:08,937
'Cause it's in your eyes.

512
01:05:13,309 --> 01:05:16,144
And why should I trust you?

513
01:05:16,146 --> 01:05:21,950
I'm giving you a choice...
To be who you wanna be.

514
01:05:23,185 --> 01:05:26,554
Maybe it's me...

515
01:05:26,556 --> 01:05:28,690
Giving you the choice.

516
01:05:37,667 --> 01:05:40,769
If you need help,
press this green button.

517
01:05:43,372 --> 01:05:44,739
And I'll come.

518
01:05:45,775 --> 01:05:48,743
Then what will become of you?

519
01:05:59,789 --> 01:06:03,391
We are gathered today,
my brothers and sisters,

520
01:06:03,393 --> 01:06:06,361
to return our brother
Jimmy to mother earth.

521
01:06:06,363 --> 01:06:09,364
His life
is not destroyed by death.

522
01:06:09,366 --> 01:06:12,033
God has taken him
to eternal life.

523
01:06:12,035 --> 01:06:16,771
As we commend Jimmy to god
and commit his body to the earth

524
01:06:16,773 --> 01:06:21,476
let us express in prayer our
common faith in the resurrection.

525
01:06:21,478 --> 01:06:23,578
As Jesus Christ was
raised from the dead,

526
01:06:23,580 --> 01:06:26,748
we too are called
to follow him through death

527
01:06:26,750 --> 01:06:30,285
to the glory
of eternal life with god.

528
01:06:34,790 --> 01:06:36,925
Old Jimmy told me all about you.

529
01:06:40,363 --> 01:06:43,031
He wanted me to give you this.

530
01:06:44,834 --> 01:06:47,535
Your father had two brothers.

531
01:06:47,537 --> 01:06:50,638
That's them at the
front there, on the side.

532
01:06:50,640 --> 01:06:52,807
Your father's
the one at the end.

533
01:06:56,479 --> 01:06:58,046
What happened to them?

534
01:06:59,348 --> 01:07:01,616
Government sent people away.

535
01:07:01,618 --> 01:07:04,652
Far away from here.

536
01:07:04,654 --> 01:07:08,823
They must have been with 'em.

537
01:07:08,825 --> 01:07:11,860
There's a lot of families
out here won't accept you.

538
01:07:11,862 --> 01:07:16,865
They want to keep everything
for themselves.

539
01:07:16,867 --> 01:07:20,035
But old Jimmy
wanted you to know that...

540
01:07:21,637 --> 01:07:26,074
This mob... it's your mob.

541
01:07:27,343 --> 01:07:29,778
This land, you belong to it.

542
01:08:44,753 --> 01:08:49,624
Come in!

543
01:08:51,527 --> 01:08:54,162
Detective swan.

544
01:08:54,164 --> 01:08:56,498
Cuppa tea?

545
01:09:06,242 --> 01:09:08,576
Grandchildren?

546
01:09:08,578 --> 01:09:12,213
Nah, I couldn't have kids.

547
01:09:12,215 --> 01:09:15,917
So I figured sponsors
was the next best thing.

548
01:09:21,891 --> 01:09:23,925
I heard you were
at Jimmy's funeral.

549
01:09:23,927 --> 01:09:27,829
Just plain terrible
what's happening out there.

550
01:09:27,831 --> 01:09:30,999
People taking their own lives.

551
01:09:31,001 --> 01:09:33,301
We lost a bunch
of kids last year.

552
01:09:33,303 --> 01:09:36,337
Yeah, I was speaking
to Jimmy's daughter, Maria.

553
01:09:36,339 --> 01:09:38,473
She must be devastated.

554
01:09:38,475 --> 01:09:41,276
Yeah, she was saying
Jimmy was gettin' pressure.

555
01:09:41,278 --> 01:09:46,080
Really? Who from? The land
council and furnace creek.

556
01:09:48,017 --> 01:09:53,254
I heard you caused a bit of
commotion back in your hometown.

557
01:09:53,256 --> 01:09:56,157
Is that right?

558
01:09:56,159 --> 01:09:59,561
I was just doin' my job.

559
01:09:59,563 --> 01:10:02,931
My daddy was a sheep farmer

560
01:10:02,933 --> 01:10:06,568
a long way south
and a little bit east of here.

561
01:10:06,570 --> 01:10:11,839
Fifty thousand acres
of the most desolate,

562
01:10:11,841 --> 01:10:15,343
driest land you've ever seen.

563
01:10:15,345 --> 01:10:18,046
Now, my daddy was a hard man,

564
01:10:18,048 --> 01:10:22,050
but my granddaddy...
He was from a different world.

565
01:10:22,052 --> 01:10:26,588
Nothing my daddy did could
ever please that old man.

566
01:10:26,590 --> 01:10:31,092
There was no pleasing
my daddy, either.

567
01:10:31,094 --> 01:10:35,763
When I heard he'd hanged himself in
the feed shed one October morning,

568
01:10:35,765 --> 01:10:38,766
I couldn't feel any sorrow.

569
01:10:38,768 --> 01:10:42,971
Couldn't find
a reason to miss him.

570
01:10:42,973 --> 01:10:45,873
And then it dawned on me.

571
01:10:47,509 --> 01:10:49,677
I was just like him.

572
01:10:49,679 --> 01:10:53,281
Daddy and granddaddy,
the three of us.

573
01:10:53,283 --> 01:10:55,817
As hard as that trampled on,

574
01:10:55,819 --> 01:11:00,722
dried old earth
that we grew up on.

575
01:11:00,724 --> 01:11:04,259
So after skippin'
from town to town,

576
01:11:04,261 --> 01:11:06,894
marriage number five,

577
01:11:06,896 --> 01:11:09,097
I just let things go.

578
01:11:09,099 --> 01:11:13,735
Decided I just had
to look after number one.

579
01:11:15,704 --> 01:11:19,707
Now, I never
told anyone that before.

580
01:11:19,709 --> 01:11:21,376
But I reckon you
should think about it, Jay,

581
01:11:21,378 --> 01:11:26,281
'cause one day you might wake up
and find yourself lonely

582
01:11:26,283 --> 01:11:29,450
and old and poor,

583
01:11:29,452 --> 01:11:32,720
with nothin' to keep
you company but the flies

584
01:11:32,722 --> 01:11:34,922
'cause you left
the door half open.

585
01:11:37,092 --> 01:11:39,327
Now, here we are being civilized

586
01:11:39,329 --> 01:11:41,229
to one another,

587
01:11:41,231 --> 01:11:42,630
but you and I both know

588
01:11:42,632 --> 01:11:44,899
things are gonna
change sooner or later.

589
01:11:45,801 --> 01:11:48,336
Don't get me wrong.

590
01:11:48,338 --> 01:11:51,005
I like you, Jay.

591
01:11:51,907 --> 01:11:53,708
Just don't take it personal

592
01:11:53,710 --> 01:11:56,744
when things turn
from ripe to rotten.

593
01:11:56,746 --> 01:12:00,248
'Cause that's how life is, Jay.

594
01:12:03,352 --> 01:12:05,219
Drive carefully.

595
01:12:35,184 --> 01:12:38,653
They bitin'?
Not like they used to.

596
01:12:38,655 --> 01:12:42,056
Nah, it's a shame.

597
01:12:47,963 --> 01:12:49,897
Aren't you gonna count it?

598
01:12:49,899 --> 01:12:53,067
No, I trust you.

599
01:12:53,069 --> 01:12:55,570
You shouldn't, ya know.

600
01:12:55,572 --> 01:12:59,874
You know that black cop's
been talkin' to Maria?

601
01:12:59,876 --> 01:13:04,645
Yeah, I know.
What he say?

602
01:13:04,647 --> 01:13:06,681
Nothin' much.

603
01:13:06,683 --> 01:13:09,884
It was more the way he said it.

604
01:13:09,886 --> 01:13:12,253
He's trying to get
something out of you.

605
01:13:12,255 --> 01:13:18,059
Well, you won't have
to worry about him anymore.

606
01:13:18,061 --> 01:13:20,228
What you gonna do about Maria?

607
01:13:20,230 --> 01:13:22,463
What do you want me to do?

608
01:13:22,465 --> 01:13:24,399
Keep her mouth shut.

609
01:13:26,869 --> 01:13:28,803
You're doin' the right thing.

610
01:13:28,805 --> 01:13:30,872
The past is the past.

611
01:13:30,874 --> 01:13:33,141
It's time for your people
to move on.

612
01:13:34,743 --> 01:13:36,477
Tommy?

613
01:13:37,746 --> 01:13:40,047
Are we right?

614
01:14:28,397 --> 01:14:30,097
What do you want?

615
01:14:31,233 --> 01:14:32,300
The passport.

616
01:14:34,336 --> 01:14:36,838
I just wanna know
where you found it.

617
01:14:38,173 --> 01:14:39,841
I don't want any trouble.

618
01:14:41,543 --> 01:14:45,313
If you just show me
where you found the passport,

619
01:14:45,315 --> 01:14:47,882
I'll leave you alone, I promise.

620
01:14:56,792 --> 01:14:58,593
Up there.

621
01:14:58,595 --> 01:15:01,896
I was scratching around
and come across it by accident.

622
01:15:01,898 --> 01:15:03,798
You find anything else up there?

623
01:15:03,800 --> 01:15:06,267
Just rubbish. Fool's gold.

624
01:15:07,736 --> 01:15:11,906
Seen some fuckin' bikies
'round here, shootin'.

625
01:15:11,908 --> 01:15:14,342
- Shootin' what?
- At wild dogs.

626
01:15:14,344 --> 01:15:16,344
Anything that fuckin'
moves or doesn't move.

627
01:15:16,346 --> 01:15:21,349
They even fuckin' shot up
me fuckin' mail box. Twice.

628
01:15:23,819 --> 01:15:25,319
Where'd they come from?

629
01:15:25,321 --> 01:15:28,956
Where do you
think they come from?

630
01:15:28,958 --> 01:15:32,126
Fuckin' furnace fuckin' creek.

631
01:18:15,023 --> 01:18:18,492
Mrs. Lao?
Yes?

632
01:18:18,494 --> 01:18:20,528
That's a lot of noodles
you've got there.

633
01:18:20,530 --> 01:18:21,829
Can I help you?

634
01:18:21,831 --> 01:18:23,764
Yeah, I was hoping I could
ask you a few questions.

635
01:18:23,766 --> 01:18:27,435
Sorry, I'm very busy. Yeah, no worries.
Won't take long.

636
01:18:29,805 --> 01:18:33,207
Did you ever have a girl out
there by the name of Zhang Mei?

637
01:18:34,309 --> 01:18:36,143
I can't remember.

638
01:18:36,145 --> 01:18:37,645
You sure?

639
01:18:39,181 --> 01:18:44,552
What do you want?
The truth.

640
01:18:44,554 --> 01:18:47,054
What's really
going on out there?

641
01:18:49,157 --> 01:18:51,058
What's always been going on.

642
01:19:09,111 --> 01:19:10,845
Tommy.

643
01:19:13,782 --> 01:19:15,549
Tommy.

644
01:19:17,786 --> 01:19:19,787
You all right?

645
01:19:22,591 --> 01:19:26,260
What do you wanna do, Tommy?

646
01:19:28,163 --> 01:19:31,632
I wanna clean the dust away.

647
01:19:31,634 --> 01:19:33,367
Make it shine again.

648
01:19:40,742 --> 01:19:42,810
I wanna make a statement.

649
01:19:52,554 --> 01:19:55,156
How long's this been goin' on?

650
01:19:55,158 --> 01:19:58,058
You gotta sign the papers,
film people...

651
01:19:58,060 --> 01:19:59,894
Tommy, how much?

652
01:19:59,896 --> 01:20:03,330
The man, he wants some money
if you don't sign the paper...

653
01:20:08,703 --> 01:20:12,706
Tommy, what happened
with old Jimmy?

654
01:20:23,652 --> 01:20:26,620
I grab him
and I put the rope around him,

655
01:20:26,622 --> 01:20:29,857
took him, and I lift him up.

656
01:20:35,664 --> 01:20:37,198
All right.

657
01:22:12,994 --> 01:22:14,028
Hey, Josh.

658
01:22:15,230 --> 01:22:16,563
I want to see the girls.

659
01:22:16,565 --> 01:22:18,766
They're not here.
What do you mean

660
01:22:18,768 --> 01:22:20,534
they're not here?
Bring the fuckin' girls out.

661
01:22:20,536 --> 01:22:22,770
What are you doin' here, Josh?

662
01:22:33,782 --> 01:22:37,418
Where are they? What's wrong with you?
You know the rules.

663
01:22:37,420 --> 01:22:39,420
When's the next plane?

664
01:22:39,422 --> 01:22:41,488
Mayor's not going
to be happy about this.

665
01:24:41,209 --> 01:24:42,576
You okay there, Maureen?

666
01:24:42,578 --> 01:24:46,413
Josh, you gave me a fright.

667
01:24:47,215 --> 01:24:48,682
You working on a Sunday?

668
01:24:49,551 --> 01:24:52,119
Yeah, just...

669
01:24:52,121 --> 01:24:54,088
Tying up a few loose ends.

670
01:24:54,090 --> 01:24:55,789
What can I do for you, Josh?

671
01:24:55,791 --> 01:24:58,425
Well, Maureen,
I'll just get right to it.

672
01:24:58,427 --> 01:25:01,662
I know you're involved
in old Jimmy's death.

673
01:25:01,664 --> 01:25:03,931
You realize
what you're sayin', Josh?

674
01:25:03,933 --> 01:25:06,700
Cut the bullshit, Maureen.
Your hands are all over it

675
01:25:06,702 --> 01:25:08,235
and I can prove it.

676
01:25:08,237 --> 01:25:10,137
Just like I can prove
you've been on the take

677
01:25:10,139 --> 01:25:11,371
with furnace creek.

678
01:25:11,373 --> 01:25:13,373
Josh, I'm just an old woman

679
01:25:13,375 --> 01:25:14,942
who likes to bake pies.

680
01:25:14,944 --> 01:25:18,145
I've got 12 sponsor kids,
for Christ's sake.

681
01:25:19,514 --> 01:25:22,249
Whoever's got the girls,
I wanna meet 'em.

682
01:25:22,251 --> 01:25:23,717
And I wanna meet 'em now.

683
01:25:26,488 --> 01:25:29,323
Which girls?
Don't fuck with me, Maureen.

684
01:25:29,325 --> 01:25:33,694
Josh, I don't know what's gotten into you.
You're not yourself.

685
01:25:33,696 --> 01:25:35,762
I need you to set it up.

686
01:25:37,899 --> 01:25:42,703
How much do you
think your life's worth?

687
01:25:42,705 --> 01:25:46,340
There's billions
of dollars out there.

688
01:25:46,342 --> 01:25:50,410
How do you think that compares with an
old blackfella or a lone Asian girl?

689
01:25:50,412 --> 01:25:53,380
A prostitute, for Christ's sake.

690
01:25:53,382 --> 01:25:57,951
But I guess that's
just your style, isn't it?

691
01:25:57,953 --> 01:26:01,622
A copper who prefers to spend
his time with working girls.

692
01:26:01,624 --> 01:26:05,259
Not a good look for a young cop who
wants to step up in the world, is it?

693
01:26:06,528 --> 01:26:07,995
And those hands of yours,

694
01:26:07,997 --> 01:26:11,431
they may not be
as dipped as some,

695
01:26:11,433 --> 01:26:15,636
but they're not squeaky
clean either, are they, Josh?

696
01:26:15,638 --> 01:26:21,074
You set it up, or I'll get the
fuckin' feds up here tomorrow.

697
01:26:25,580 --> 01:26:26,880
I'll need some bait.

698
01:26:26,882 --> 01:26:28,682
Tell 'em I want in.

699
01:26:28,684 --> 01:26:31,585
Do you really want in, Josh?

700
01:26:31,587 --> 01:26:34,721
Your own big slice of the pie?

701
01:26:34,723 --> 01:26:36,123
Make the call.

702
01:26:36,125 --> 01:26:37,991
Or I will.

703
01:28:59,367 --> 01:29:01,068
Josh.

704
01:29:01,936 --> 01:29:04,271
What's goin' on?

705
01:29:05,239 --> 01:29:07,107
You tell me what's goin' on.

706
01:29:09,944 --> 01:29:11,745
One sec.

707
01:29:32,700 --> 01:29:34,401
Can you do something
for us, mate?

708
01:29:35,770 --> 01:29:37,070
Yeah, what's that, mate?

709
01:29:37,072 --> 01:29:38,939
Just grab that
shovel over there.

710
01:29:38,941 --> 01:29:40,707
Make yourself useful.

711
01:29:45,213 --> 01:29:47,247
Don't.

712
01:29:58,426 --> 01:30:00,227
Let's go.

713
01:30:43,571 --> 01:30:47,707
You wanna get close,
this is how you do it.

714
01:30:47,709 --> 01:30:50,177
Make it nice and fuckin' big.

715
01:30:50,179 --> 01:30:52,512
Nothin' personal, Joshy.

716
01:30:53,848 --> 01:30:55,482
Just business.

717
01:31:15,470 --> 01:31:17,137
Hands on your head.

718
01:31:37,492 --> 01:31:39,326
Ah!

719
01:31:41,830 --> 01:31:43,463
Ahh!

720
01:32:47,128 --> 01:32:48,595
Are you sure you wanna do this?

721
01:35:33,327 --> 01:35:34,527
Ahh!

722
01:35:38,766 --> 01:35:40,166
Where are they?

723
01:35:40,168 --> 01:35:42,569
Who?
The girls.

724
01:35:42,571 --> 01:35:44,170
The laundry.

725
01:36:51,639 --> 01:36:53,406
Get on the ground!
Get on the ground now!

726
01:36:53,408 --> 01:36:55,708
On the ground!
On the fuckin' ground!

727
01:40:47,875 --> 01:40:49,976
Mayor's left town
without a trace.

728
01:40:51,311 --> 01:40:53,112
No sign of her yet.

729
01:40:54,681 --> 01:40:56,582
But you're free to go.

730
01:40:56,584 --> 01:40:58,684
The feds have
taken over everything.

731
01:41:01,188 --> 01:41:04,424
It's all gone down
to the city with the girls.

732
01:41:04,426 --> 01:41:06,959
I'm just waiting
to see what happens.

733
01:41:19,139 --> 01:41:22,542
End up seeing any of them
wild dogs gettin' around?

734
01:41:24,912 --> 01:41:28,514
I seen somethin' out there,

735
01:41:28,516 --> 01:41:31,451
but I'm not sure what it was.

736
01:41:31,453 --> 01:41:33,820
But I do know it
was no bad thing.

737
01:41:37,691 --> 01:41:40,693
You know, growin' up
out here in the bush,

738
01:41:40,695 --> 01:41:43,362
I wouldn't
change it for anything.

739
01:41:43,364 --> 01:41:45,932
And I mean anything.

740
01:41:45,934 --> 01:41:50,803
But sometimes I can't help
but get this feelin' that...

741
01:41:54,141 --> 01:41:56,876
I coulda been...

742
01:41:58,045 --> 01:42:00,780
Or I shoulda been...

743
01:42:00,782 --> 01:42:06,986
Somethin' more than...
What I turned out.

744
01:42:08,722 --> 01:42:11,858
I tell myself not to listen.

745
01:42:12,659 --> 01:42:15,428
It's just this...

746
01:42:15,430 --> 01:42:18,731
Small piece inside...

747
01:42:21,835 --> 01:42:24,737
That's cryin' out to be me.

748
01:42:30,310 --> 01:42:32,211
I'm gonna put in for a transfer.

749
01:42:35,482 --> 01:42:38,684
Somewhere by the ocean.

750
01:42:38,686 --> 01:42:42,054
Need to clean a bit
of this dust out of me, Jay.

751
01:42:44,424 --> 01:42:46,259
What about you?

752
01:42:46,261 --> 01:42:47,827
You headin' home?

753
01:42:55,802 --> 01:42:57,737
I guess.
