00:34:46,217 --> 00:34:49,319
             Now, out here, Jay,

289
00:34:49,321 --> 00:34:52,155
       we run a very tight ship,

290
00:34:52,157 --> 00:34:57,094
  where even the smallest stones
  can cause mighty big ripples.

291
00:34:57,096 --> 00:35:00,797
   And we don't take
   too kindly to mob who come in

292
00:35:00,799 --> 00:35:03,467
                and throw stones
                with no reason.

293
00:35:03,469 --> 00:35:06,269
       Young Josh is a good boy.

00:35:06,271 --> 00:35:11,741
           Took him a while,
           but he understands
           how this place works.

295
00:35:11,743 --> 00:35:15,946
           So I suggest you keep
           your head down,

296
00:35:15,948 --> 00:35:18,048
               keep those waters
               nice and still.

             do like the others.

558
01:05:01,163 --> 01:05:02,864
        Let me help you.

559
01:05:02,866 --> 01:05:06,501
                Why do you
                think I need it?

560
01:05:06,503 --> 01:05:08,937
   'Cause it's in your eyes.

561
01:05:13,309 --> 01:05:16,144
     And why should I trust you?

562
01:05:16,146 --> 01:05:21,950
   I'm giving you a choice...
   to be who you wanna be.

563
01:05:23,185 --> 01:05:26,554
                Maybe it's me...

564
01:05:26,556 --> 01:05:28,690
          giving you the choice.

565
01:05:37,667 --> 01:05:40,769
If you need help,
press this green button.

566
01:05:43,372 --> 01:05:44,739
And I'll come.

567
01:05:45,775 --> 01:05:48,743
                  Then what will
                  become of you?

568
01:05:59,789 --> 01:06:03,391
[priest] We are gathered today,
my brothers and sisters,

569
01:06:03,393 --> 01:06:06,361
     to return our brother
     Jimmy to mother earth.

570
01:06:06,363 --> 01:06:09,364
   His life
   is not destroyed by death.

571
01:06:09,366 --> 01:06:12,033
       God has taken him
       to eternal life.

572
01:06:12,035 --> 01:06:16,771
As we commend Jimmy to God
and commit his body to the earth

573
01:06:16,773 --> 01:06:21,476
   let us express
   in prayer our common faith
   in the resurrection.

574
01:06:21,478 --> 01:06:23,578
     As Jesus Christ was
     raised from the dead,

575
01:06:23,580 --> 01:06:26,748
  we too are called
  to follow him through death

576
01:06:26,750 --> 01:06:30,285
   to the glory
   of eternal life with God.

577
01:06:30,287 --> 01:06:32,687
[priest continues indistinctly]

578
01:06:34,790 --> 01:06:36,925
       Old Jimmy told me
       all about you.

579
01:06:40,363 --> 01:06:43,031
               He wanted me
               to give you this.

580
01:06:44,834 --> 01:06:47,535
               Your father
               had two brothers.

581
01:06:47,537 --> 01:06:50,638
       That's them at the
       front there, on the side.

582
01:06:50,640 --> 01:06:52,807
             Your father's
             the one at the end.

583
01:06:56,479 --> 01:06:58,046
     What happened to them?

584
01:06:59,348 --> 01:07:01,616
    Government sent people away.

585
01:07:01,618 --> 01:07:04,652
             Far away from here.

586
01:07:04,654 --> 01:07:08,823
             They must
             have been with 'em.

587
01:07:08,825 --> 01:07:11,860
      There's a lot of families
      out here won't accept you.

588
01:07:11,862 --> 01:07:16,865
    They want to keep everything
    for themselves.

589
01:07:16,867 --> 01:07:20,035
      But old Jimmy
      wanted you to know that...

590
01:07:21,637 --> 01:07:26,074
      This mob... it's your mob.

591
01:07:27,343 --> 01:07:29,778
    This land, you belong to it.

592
01:08:44,753 --> 01:08:49,624
  [kitchen appliance whirring]
  [Maureen] Come in!

593
01:08:51,527 --> 01:08:54,162
        Detective Swan.

594
01:08:54,164 --> 01:08:56,498
           Cuppa tea?

595
01:09:06,242 --> 01:09:08,576
         Grandchildren?

596
01:09:08,578 --> 01:09:12,213
      Nah, I couldn't have kids.

597
01:09:12,215 --> 01:09:15,917
        So I figured sponsors
        was the next best thing.

598
01:09:21,891 --> 01:09:23,925
             I heard you were
             at Jimmy's funeral.

599
01:09:23,927 --> 01:09:27,829
     Just plain terrible
     what's happening out there.

600
01:09:27,831 --> 01:09:30,999
                People taking
                their own lives.

601
01:09:31,001 --> 01:09:33,301
              We lost a bunch
              of kids last year.

602
01:09:33,303 --> 01:09:36,337
Yeah, I was speaking
to Jimmy's daughter, Maria.

603
01:09:36,339 --> 01:09:38,473
    She must be devastated.

604
01:09:38,475 --> 01:09:41,276
  Yeah, she was saying
  Jimmy was gettin' pressure.

605
01:09:41,278 --> 01:09:46,080
            Really? Who from?
    The Land Council
    and Furnace Creek.

606
01:09:48,017 --> 01:09:53,254
     I heard you caused
     a bit of commotion
     back in your hometown.

607
01:09:53,256 --> 01:09:56,157
                  Is that right?

608
01:09:56,159 --> 01:09:59,561
I was just doin' my job.

609
01:09:59,563 --> 01:10:02,931
     My daddy was a sheep farmer

610
01:10:02,933 --> 01:10:06,568
  a long way south
  and a little bit east of here.

611
01:10:06,570 --> 01:10:11,839
           Fifty thousand acres
           of the most desolate,

612
01:10:11,841 --> 01:10:15,343
   driest land you've ever seen.

613
01:10:15,345 --> 01:10:18,046
   Now, my daddy was a hard man,

614
01:10:18,048 --> 01:10:22,050
  but my granddaddy... [exhales]
  he was from a different world.

615
01:10:22,052 --> 01:10:26,588
      Nothing my daddy did could
      ever please that old man.

616
01:10:26,590 --> 01:10:31,092
           There was no pleasing
           my daddy, either.

617
01:10:31,094 --> 01:10:35,763
When I heard he'd
hanged himself in the feed shed
one October morning,

618
01:10:35,765 --> 01:10:38,766
  I couldn't feel any sorrow.

619
01:10:38,768 --> 01:10:42,971
     Couldn't find
     a reason to miss him.

620
01:10:42,973 --> 01:10:45,873
   And then it dawned on me.

621
01:10:47,509 --> 01:10:49,677
      I was just like him.

622
01:10:49,679 --> 01:10:53,281
     Daddy and Granddaddy,
     the three of us.

623
01:10:53,283 --> 01:10:55,817
  As hard as that trampled on,

624
01:10:55,819 --> 01:11:00,722
      dried old earth
      that we grew up on.

625
01:11:00,724 --> 01:11:04,259
              So after skippin'
              from town to town,

626
01:11:04,261 --> 01:11:06,894
           marriage number five,

627
01:11:06,896 --> 01:11:09,097
           I just let things go.

628
01:11:09,099 --> 01:11:13,735
       Decided I just had
       to look after number one.

629
01:11:15,704 --> 01:11:19,707
        Now, I never
        told anyone that before.

630
01:11:19,709 --> 01:11:21,376
     But I reckon you
     should think about it, Jay,

631
01:11:21,378 --> 01:11:26,281
'cause one day you might wake up
and find yourself lonely

632
01:11:26,283 --> 01:11:29,450
               and old and poor,

633
01:11:29,452 --> 01:11:32,720
       with nothin' to keep
       you company but the flies

634
01:11:32,722 --> 01:11:34,922
             'cause you left
             the door half open.

635
01:11:37,092 --> 01:11:39,327
                Now, here we are
                being civilized

636
01:11:39,329 --> 01:11:41,229
                 to one another,

637
01:11:41,231 --> 01:11:42,630
         but you and I both know

638
01:11:42,632 --> 01:11:44,899
         things are gonna
         change sooner or later.

639
01:11:45,801 --> 01:11:48,336
             Don't get me wrong.

640
01:11:48,338 --> 01:11:51,005
                I like you, Jay.

641
01:11:51,907 --> 01:11:53,708
     Just don't take it personal

642
01:11:53,710 --> 01:11:56,744
            when things turn
            from ripe to rotten.

643
01:11:56,746 --> 01:12:00,248
 'Cause that's how life is, Jay.

644
01:12:03,352 --> 01:12:05,219
        Drive carefully.

645
01:12:35,184 --> 01:12:38,653
They bitin'?
        Not like they used to.

646
01:12:38,655 --> 01:12:42,056
Nah, it's a shame.

647
01:12:47,963 --> 01:12:49,897
Aren't you gonna count it?

648
01:12:49,899 --> 01:12:53,067
                No, I trust you.
[laughs]

649
01:12:53,069 --> 01:12:55,570
You shouldn't, ya know.

650
01:12:55,572 --> 01:12:59,874
You know that black cop's
been talkin' to Maria?

651
01:12:59,876 --> 01:13:04,645
                   Yeah, I know.
                   What he say?

652
01:13:04,647 --> 01:13:06,681
Nothin' much.

653
01:13:06,683 --> 01:13:09,884
It was more
the way he said it.

654
01:13:09,886 --> 01:13:12,253
           He's trying to get
           something out of you.

655
01:13:12,255 --> 01:13:18,059
Well, you won't have
to worry about him anymore.

656
01:13:18,061 --> 01:13:20,228
What you gonna
do about Maria?

657
01:13:20,230 --> 01:13:22,463
                  What do you
                  want me to do?

658
01:13:22,465 --> 01:13:24,399
Keep her mouth shut.

659
01:13:26,869 --> 01:13:28,803
You're doin'
the right thing.

660
01:13:28,805 --> 01:13:30,872
The past is the past.

661
01:13:30,874 --> 01:13:33,141
It's time for your people
to move on.

662
01:13:34,743 --> 01:13:36,477
Tommy?

663
01:13:37,746 --> 01:13:40,047
Are we right?

           [gunshot]

665

       What do you want?

666
01:14:31,233 --> 01:14:32,300
The passport.

667
01:14:34,336 --> 01:14:36,838
I just wanna know
where you found it.

668
01:14:38,173 --> 01:14:39,841
   I don't want any trouble.

669
01:14:41,543 --> 01:14:45,313
 If you just show me
 where you found the passport,

670
01:14:45,315 --> 01:14:47,882
     I'll leave you alone,
     I promise.

671
01:14:56,792 --> 01:14:58,593
                       Up there.

672
01:14:58,595 --> 01:15:01,896
 I was scratching around
 and come across it by accident.

673
01:15:01,898 --> 01:15:03,798
You find anything else up there?

674
01:15:03,800 --> 01:15:06,267
      Just rubbish. Fool's gold.

675

        Seen some fuckin' bikies
        'round here, shootin'.

676

Shootin' what?
        [stammers] At wild dogs.

677

          Anything that fuckin'
          moves or doesn't move.

678
01:15:16,346 --> 01:15:21,349
     They even fuckin' shot up
     me fuckin' mail box. Twice.

679
01:15:23,819 --> 01:15:25,319
    Where'd they come from?

680
01:15:25,321 --> 01:15:28,956
     Where do you
     think they come from?

681
01:15:28,958 --> 01:15:32,126
 Fuckin' Furnace fuckin' Creek.

         That's a lot of noodles
         you've got there.

690
01:18:20,530 --> 01:18:21,829
Can I help you?

691
01:18:21,831 --> 01:18:23,764
      Yeah, I was hoping I could
      ask you a few questions.
