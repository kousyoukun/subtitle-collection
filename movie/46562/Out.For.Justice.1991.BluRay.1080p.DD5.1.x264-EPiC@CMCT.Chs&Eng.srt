“在陌生人的眼中，街与街之间没有任何区别，我们都知道‘邻里
情谊’是在哪里画上句号的，在那之后，人们就会…形同陌路。”
——亚瑟·米勒 著名剧作家 成长于布鲁克林

3
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:56,630
快走
Step on it

4
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:00,390
怎么回事？
What's up?

5
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:02,330
没什么
Nothing.

6
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:06,150
你不再为我工作了？
You don't work for me no more?

7
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:09,890
我只是…难道我没有说我这就去帮他赚钱吗？
I was just... Didn't I just say I was going to get his money?

8
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:12,860
混蛋！我不是为电话公司工作的
Bitch, I don't work for the phone company.

9
00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:17,130
我大老远跑来不是为了做这种破事儿！你这婊子给我过来！
I don't do this shit long distance. Bring your ass here.

10
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:31,900
是不是我看起来像一堆垃圾，婊子？
Do I look like I just fell off a turnip truck, bitch?

11
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:37,320
你很清楚，鲍勃，近来你的行为有些古怪，你还好吗？
You know, Bobby, you been acting kind of strange lately. You okay?

12
00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:42,780
只是有些小麻烦，可能需要…
Just had a few personal problems. It's taken care of...

13
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:44,720
什么麻烦？
What kind of problems?

14
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:46,590
我会解决的
I'll straighten it out.

15
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:48,260
你确定？
You sure?

16
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:50,990
当然，你不用替我操心
Absolutely. Don't worry about it.

17
00:01:56,910 --> 00:01:59,670
他在干什么？他在打这个女孩
What's he doing? He's beating this girl.

18
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:04,870
我们那么好运被派到了这里
We got a 3-million dollar hit about to go down over here.

19
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:07,080
你不会喜欢的，不要看了
You don't like it, turn your head.

20
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:10,440
别这样，吉诺
Come on, Gino.

21
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,240
伙计们，出动
Guys, we're coming in.

22
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:18,280
吉诺擅自行动了，我们上
Gino's blowing it. Let's go.

23
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:25,590
我怀孕了
I'm pregnant.

24
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:29,330
你怀孕了？！一点小把戏就让你怀孕了？！
You pregnant?! You let some trick get you pregnant?!

25
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,920
难道你不知道安全套是干什么用的？！
Ain't you ever heard of a rubber?!

26
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:47,750
这王八蛋打我，我担心我会因此流产
This motherfucker hit me. I'm scared I'll lose my baby.

27
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:49,560
你这狗娘养的意大利佬！
You wop motherfucker!

28
00:02:58,330 --> 00:02:59,890
你他妈的在干什么？！
What the fuck you doing?!

29
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:01,100
你在和我说话？
You talking to me?

30
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:02,770
你他妈的以为你是谁啊？！
Who the fuck you think you are?!

31
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,230
你这么喜欢打女人？
You like to beat up on fucking women?

32
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:06,950
过来打我啊
Beat up on me.

33
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:09,240
好，很好！
Oh, yeah, that's right.

34
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:13,540
我知道你住哪，混蛋，我会找到你的老婆和孩子…
I know where you live, motherfucker. I'll fuck your wife and kids...

35
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,580
吉诺，你个婊子养的！
Gino, you son of a bitch!

36
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:39,450
为了正义

37
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,950
我有一些没有完成的生意需要去做
I got some unfinished business to take care of.

38
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:03,520
今晚都会完成的
It'll be over by the end of tonight.

39
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:06,350
跟着我干，这些钱就都是你们的
Stick by me, all that money's yours.

40
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:09,520
好多钱啊！
That's a lot of money.

41
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:12,490
我们愿意奉陪到底
We stuck with you through worse for free.

42
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,290
但愿今晚能早些结束
How long could the night be?

43
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:39,240
妈咪，我能吃个热狗吗？
Mommy, can I get a hot dog?

44
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:42,710
不行，宝贝，不要想了，好吗？
No, honey. Forget about it, okay?

45
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:50,590
如果你现在吃了热狗，那你就吃不下晚饭了
If you eat a hot dog now, you'll ruin your dinner.

46
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:54,190
另外，帮我个忙，今晚你的帆布鞋一定要干净
Also, do me a favor. IKeep your sneakers clean tonight.

47
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:57,360
别弄脏弄湿了，我们今晚要参加聚会的
No dirt, no puddles. We got a party tonight.

48
00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:09,100
让我们进去买些东西吧，鲍勃，你自己在外面等吧
Let's go in here to get some stuff. Bobby, I'll take the kids.

49
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:35,260
感觉如何，鲍勃？
How's that feel, Bobby?

50
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:37,770
现在你可笑不起来了吧
You ain't laughing now.

51
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:11,390
还好吗，宝贝？
How you doing?

52
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:14,290
很好，爸爸，我们能去玩接球游戏吗？
Good. Dad, can we play catch or what?

53
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:16,400
你做完功课了吗？
You finish your homework?

54
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,170
没做完还想要去玩接球游戏？
No? And you still want to play catch?

55
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:22,900
好吧，去拿球吧
Go get your stuff.

56
00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:30,750
停车，把烟斗给我
Stop the car. Give me the pipe.

57
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:33,410
你就那样当街杀了个警察
Doing a cop right in the street like that!

58
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:36,240
- 把烟斗给我！ - 已经很惹人注意了！
- Give me the pipe!  - It's already fucking hot!

59
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:42,860
我还要告诉你们
I got news for you.

60
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:46,750
今晚结束之前会更惹人注意！
It'll get a lot hotter before the fucking night's over.

61
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:51,490
把你那该死的车开走！
Move the goddamn car!

62
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,320
你在干什么？回车里来！
What are you doing? Get in the car!

63
00:06:55,570 --> 00:06:56,940
你搞什么？
What's your problem?

64
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,030
她死定了
He'll do her.

65
00:06:58,270 --> 00:06:59,420
- 王八蛋！ - 王八蛋？
- Asshole.  - Asshole?

66
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:11,540
你看什么看！
What are you looking at?

67
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,980
你击球，我来掷球，去拿球棒
You got the mitt. I got the ball. Get the bat.

68
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:24,690
走，我们走
Let's go. Let's go.

69
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:42,900
- 吉诺？ - 是我
- Gino?  - This is me

70
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,700
出状况了，你能过来吗？
We got a problem. Can you come in?

71
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:46,500
我和孩子在一起呢，有什么事？
I'm with the kid, why?

72
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:50,810
在第十八街区，鲍勃·路波被枪杀了，就在他妻子和孩子的面前
Bobby Lupo was shot on 18th Avenue in front of his wife and kids.

73
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,310
哦，上帝！
Oh, my God!

74
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:55,990
我会派车去接你的
I'm sending you a car.

75
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:11,430
维克，我现在得把托尼送你那去
Vick, I got to send Tony over right now.

76
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:15,760
你就知道那该死的工作！他为了和你共度周末等了一个月了！
Damn you and the job! He waits a month for one weekend with you.

77
00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:18,890
我知道，可是鲍勃刚才被枪杀了
I know, but Bobby just got shot.

78
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,900
哦，上帝！
Oh, my God!

79
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:23,250
当时劳丽和孩子同他在一起
Laurie and the kids were with him.

80
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:28,480
我这就过去，先把托尼送到我父母家吧
I'll be right over. Send Tony to my parents' house.

81
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:30,970
我一会儿过去接他
I'll pick him up afterwards.

82
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:51,660
带他们离开这里吧，维克，拜托了
Get them out of here, Vick, please.

83
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:58,530
你确定你想看看？
Sure you want to see this?

84
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:05,750
让开一下，让他看看，快点儿
Give him some room, will you? Come on!

85
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:09,550
找找还有没有更多的目击证人
See if there are any more witnesses.

86
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:11,880
目前只有个卖水果的家伙看到了一切
All I got is this fruit and vegetable guy.

87
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:27,130
真的很难过，吉诺，是理查·马德诺干的
I'm real sorry, Gino. It was Richie Madano.

88
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:32,060
劳丽说，理查下了车就径直走了过去，然后“砰”就开枪了
Laurie said Richie got out of the car and just stepped up. Bang!

89
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:36,670
卖水果的说理查扔下了什么东西，可是我们什么也没发现
The grocer said Richie tossed something. We didn't find nothing.

90
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:41,070
我们都知道该怎么惩治罪犯
We know every mob operation.

91
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,900
我们会揪出他们，迫使他们投降
We'll squeeze them to give him up.

92
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:48,420
尽管去做吧，但找到这帮混蛋的会是我，你很清楚的
Do that. But it's me who'll find this fucking guy. You know that.

93
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:50,140
你和维克…
You and Vicky...

94
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:53,580
这个月我们就要离婚了
Divorce goes through this month.

95
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,280
是怎么一回事？
How'd it happen?

96
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:59,520
是理查·马德诺，某个自作聪明的混蛋
Some wannabe wiseguy asshole, Richie Madano.

97
00:10:00,530 --> 00:10:02,220
毒贩子，他自己也吸毒
Dope dealer, dope user...

98
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:04,930
他是和吉诺、鲍勃一起长大的
He was a guy Bobby and Gino grew up with.

99
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:07,320
我们不清楚他为什么要杀鲍勃
We don't know why he'd kill Bobby.

100
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:09,570
长官
sir.

101
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:11,370
等我一会儿
Wait for me for a while

102
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:19,770
- 你还好吗？ - 不，很不好！他是我最好的朋友！
- Are you all right?  - No, I'm not! He was my best friend.

103
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:25,210
他刚才把一个女人从车里拉出来…
He just pulled a woman out of a car...

104
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:27,820
射穿了她的脑袋，这似乎很不合常理
...and blew her brains out. It looks random.

105
00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:31,180
他身边还有三个小弟，其中一个在脖子上有纹身
Three of his crew were with him. One has a tattoo on his neck.

106
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:33,290
我知道他是谁，波奇
I know him. Bochi.

107
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:36,390
他就是堆狗屎，他的犯罪记录和我的胳膊一样长
He's a piece of shit. Got a sheet as long as my arm.

108
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:39,620
我们要搜索整个城市，每名警员都出动了
We got a city-wide out, every officer.

109
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:42,490
在机场、火车站、公共汽车站都有我们的人
We got A.L.'s at the airports, trains, buses...

110
00:10:42,770 --> 00:10:44,280
这混蛋不会逃跑的
This guy won't run.

111
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:47,490
他会躲起来，但决不会离开布鲁克林
He'll sneak and hide, but he won't leave Brooklyn.

112
00:10:49,070 --> 00:10:52,630
我会告诉你他的每个毒窝在哪，但你得让我用我的方式来解决这件事
I'll feed you every dope dive he's got, but let me do it my way.

113
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:55,070
给我一辆没记号的车和一把散弹枪
Just give me an unmarked and a shotgun.

114
00:11:03,890 --> 00:11:06,640
别这样，你太过深入了，让其他警察去处理吧
Don't. You're too close. Let other cops do it.

115
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:09,680
我比这的任何人都更了解那个混蛋
I know this guy better than anybody else.

116
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:13,350
我比其他任何人都更知道这儿的邻里关系
I know the neighborhood better than anyone else.

117
00:11:22,330 --> 00:11:24,770
- 那小心点，好吗？ - 你了解我的
- Be careful, will you?  - You know me.

118
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:29,000
- 一定要抓住那个狗娘养的  - 我会尽我所能的
- Get the son of a bitch.  - I'll do what I can.

119
00:11:31,570 --> 00:11:33,230
为什么这家伙不逃跑？
Why won't this man run?

120
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:36,840
你永远不会理解什么是邻里情结
You never understood nothing about the neighborhood.

121
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:38,610
我猜也是
I guess not.

122
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:42,910
你在目击者面前杀了一名警察，你就等于自寻死路
You kill a cop in front of witnesses, you're going to die.

123
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:46,650
与其他人不同的是，这个家伙就是想要死在他自己的地盘上
The difference is, this guy wants to die in his own neighborhood.

124
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:50,450
你为什么不像狗那样在树根上小便，来标记自己的地盘呢？
Why can't you all piss on a tree, mark territory, like dogs?

125
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:55,190
别担心，我会准时参加离婚听证会的
Don't worry. I'll be at the divorce hearing on time, in 1 piece.

126
00:11:57,830 --> 00:12:01,700
我会把劳丽和孩子们接到咱们家的
I'll pick up Laurie and the girls and bring them to our house.

127
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,200
处理完这件事，我们就可以处理我们之间的事了
Finish this so we can finish our business.

128
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:27,330
- 让弗兰克听电话  - 好的
- Put Frank on the phone.  - OK

129
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:32,230
弗兰克，是我，布鲁诺

130
00:12:32,730 --> 00:12:36,030
- 查理杀了鲍勃  - 他干什么了？

131
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:39,330
- 就在他老婆和孩子的面前  - 是吗？

132
00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:40,630
看看你能做些什么吧

133
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:45,930
在警察逮到查理·马德诺之前找到他，然后把他给我带到这儿来！
Find Richie Madano before the cops do and bring him to me, here!

134
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:50,510
吉诺怎么办？
What about Gino?

135
00:12:50,810 --> 00:12:52,800
离吉诺远点儿，让他自己呆着
Stay away from Gino. Leave him alone.

136
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:54,680
快点儿，快去
Come on, go.

137
00:13:11,530 --> 00:13:14,480
吉诺，最近好吗？

138
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:17,730
我对发生的一切感到很遗憾，这真是耻辱啊

139
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:20,820
我也这样想，这真是罪大恶极

140
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:23,900
- 丹·维托理奥正在里面等你呢  - 谢谢

141
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,230
塞缪，你好吗？
Sammy, how are you?

142
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:29,760
你怎么在这？
Why are you here?

143
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:33,900
还是像个娘们似的扎着辫子
Still comb your hair like a girl.

144
00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:48,550
吉诺，对发生的事我感到很遗憾
Gino, I'm sorry what happened.

145
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:57,550
丹·维托理奥，很荣幸见到你，上帝保佑你

146
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:08,510
我从心底真诚地感到遗憾
My sincere regrets. Comes from my heart.

147
00:14:09,210 --> 00:14:12,620
他是个疯子

148
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:16,570
他嗑药嗑得没完没了的

149
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:18,550
竟然在他家人的面前
In front of a man's family.

150
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:21,160
太没有人性了，禽兽不如
It's inhuman. Worse than that.

151
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:24,620
那个狗娘养的简直就是个畜牲

152
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:28,460
可是他是你们的人

153
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:29,420
他没和我们在一起
He's not with us.

154
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:31,420
真的吗？

155
00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:35,220
你知道我们不会让任何人做这种事的
You know we never let nobody do anything like this.

156
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:38,230
如果你或者你的人…
If you or one of your people...

157
00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:40,500
…抓到了他…
...catch this guy...

158
00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:43,230
他会被判几年？七年或者十年？也许吧
...he gets what, seven or ten, maybe?

159
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:44,730
如果我们幸运的话
If we're lucky.

160
00:14:45,410 --> 00:14:48,570
吉诺，这个人给我，还有你，都抹黑了
Gino, this man disgraced me. And you.

161
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:52,340
他让一个无辜的人血溅家人面前
He spilled an innocent man's blood in front of his family!

162
00:14:52,650 --> 00:14:54,540
还溅在了我的人行道上！
And on my sidewalk.

163
00:14:56,330 --> 00:14:57,980
吉诺，你知道我们的规矩
Gino, you know our ways.

164
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,580
他一定要由我们来处置
He must be dealt with by us.

165
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:02,620
但是我向你保证…
But I promise you...

166
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:06,590
我会给他一次血淋淋的教训
...I will teach this man the price of our blood.

167
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:10,210
我一向很尊敬你，你是知道的

168
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:12,110
但是…

169
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:15,600
…一旦我比你们先找到他…
...God forbid I find him before you do...

170
00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:17,290
…你知道我会怎么做的
...you know what I'll do.

171
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:22,590
我知道，我知道，吉诺

172
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:25,540
好好想想吧
Think about it.

173
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:26,950
好吗，吉诺？
All right, Gino?

174
00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:31,610
当然，丹·维托理奥，上帝保佑你

175
00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:35,490
- 后会有期  - 后会有期

176
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:42,910
帮我接通丹齐
Patch me through to Doz.

177
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:44,520
一〇四即将接入
10-4, switching over.

178
00:15:45,830 --> 00:15:47,120
有什么事说吧
Go ahead, talk to me.

179
00:15:48,430 --> 00:15:52,340
维托理奥什么事也不知道，就算知道他也不会告诉我
Vittorio doesn't know nothing. If he does, he won't tell me.

180
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:57,830
我派奥·凯利和一些刑事科的人过去，保持联系
I'm sending over O'IKelly and some guys from OCCB. IKeep in touch.

181
00:15:58,510 --> 00:16:01,200
- 好的，保持联系  - 你小心着点
- Sure, I'll keep you posted.  - Watch your ass.

182
00:16:02,950 --> 00:16:05,630
“把他们杀光，让上帝整治他们”！一定是个难弄的人
"IKill them all. Let God sort them out. " Tough guy.

183
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:23,180
上帝啊，拜托…
Please, God...

184
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:25,930
竟然想让我轧死这个小东西
...let me run into this guy someday.

185
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:02,940
我听说了，希望你能逮到那个狗娘养的
I heard what happened. Hope you get the son of a bitch.

186
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:04,840
我也希望如此，给我六瓶饮料
Me too. Six-pack of seltzer.

187
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:12,010
六个死翘的华盛顿，老兄
Six dead Washingtons, brother.

188
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:19,560
从来没想到会有它
Never thought about it.

189
00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:23,750
以后就叫它寇利吉奥
We're going to call him Corragio.

190
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:28,260
遇到危险，就用钱了事，知道吗？
You see anything, you drop a dime.

191
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:30,030
你妈妈还好吗？
How's your mother?

192
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,900
她已经没事了
She's going straight now.

193
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:34,900
谢天谢地
Thank God.

194
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:47,750
想上床吗？
You want to fuck?

195
00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:54,190
听到她说什么了吗？
Did you hear what she said?

196
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:57,250
她说了什么？说了什么？
What'd she say, my man? What'd she say?

197
00:18:57,790 --> 00:19:02,160
我在日落公园和第三大道这里，理查的客户们都会来这儿
I'm at Sunset Park and 3rd. Richie's clients are all down here.

198
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,660
不可能
Ain't it the truth.

199
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:14,940
我要找两个带种的人做后备，有带种的吗？
I'm looking for two hotshots for backup! Anybody got the balls?

200
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:17,140
你们谁有种？
Anybody got the balls?

201
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:19,880
你怎么样？你够种吗？
How about you? You got the fucking balls?

202
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:21,310
我当然够种
I got the balls.

203
00:19:21,650 --> 00:19:22,620
那你就有面包吃了
Now you got the bread.

204
00:19:23,150 --> 00:19:24,350
是吉诺！
It's Gino!

205
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:26,620
快上车！
Get in the fucking car!

206
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,120
后备！
Back up!

207
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:36,030
别挡道儿！
Get the fuck out of the way!

208
00:20:32,410 --> 00:20:33,400
右转！
Make a fucking right!

209
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:37,410
拜托，我正在试图甩掉他！汽车超重了
I'm trying to lose him, for chrissakes! Too much weight in the car!

210
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:47,310
你要是没办法甩掉他，我就先嘣了你
If you don't lose this cocksucker I'm going to pop you first.

211
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:48,580
这小子真行！
This guy's good.

212
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:52,060
你们还没玩够吗？
You having fun yet, guys?

213
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,490
快甩掉他！
Lose this fucking guy!

214
00:21:00,770 --> 00:21:02,860
你来试试？
You want to drive this fucking car?!

215
00:21:03,210 --> 00:21:07,370
住口，你听到了吗？你给我住口！
Shut the fuck up, you hear me?! Shut the fuck up!

216
00:21:08,550 --> 00:21:09,330
我来对付他
I'll get him.

217
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:17,810
就在这里甩掉他
This is where we lose him.

218
00:21:19,550 --> 00:21:20,740
我们就要脱身了！
This is our break coming up!

219
00:21:22,050 --> 00:21:23,180
当心，当心！
Hang on!

220
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:25,580
妈的！
Holy shit!

221
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:32,250
快开走，别挡道！
Get out of the way!

222
00:21:44,310 --> 00:21:47,710
我们还没甩掉他，让他尝尝剁猪排的味道
We haven't lost him yet. Let's take him for some pork chops.

223
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:01,710
闪一边去！
Back up!

224
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:05,270
把枪和子弹拿来
Give me the merch and the bullets.

225
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:07,490
他说什么你们就做什么
Do what he fucking says.

226
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:08,950
我们快走
Let's get out of here.

227
00:22:11,270 --> 00:22:12,810
好，他来了
All right, here he is.

228
00:22:13,270 --> 00:22:16,490
我要你们把他挂在钩子上，听到了没有？
I want you to hang this motherfucker on a hook, you hear me?

229
00:22:16,810 --> 00:22:19,490
我有笔旧帐要跟他算，你们三个，跟我走
I got some scores to settle. You 3 come with me.

230
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,400
走！
Let's go!

231
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:24,660
要把他给我挂在钩子上！
Hang him up by a hook!

232
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:47,090
他们会让他尝到砍刀的厉害
We'll cut him a new ass!

233
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,060
来呀！
Come get some!

234
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:04,530
打爆他的头！
Bust his head!

235
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:16,720
听着，理查不是个好东西，我的朋友们不喜欢他，你们的也是
Richie's a bad guy. My friends don't like him and yours don't like him.

236
00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:18,620
你们打错对象了
You hang around the wrong people.

237
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:23,950
这是给你的，猪
This is for you, motherfucker!

238
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,920
别做个坏人
Don't be a bad guy.

239
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:28,080
你对我开枪有什么好处？
What you want to shoot me for?

240
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:30,560
别学那个坏蛋
Don't be a bad guy like that.

241
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:32,700
做个好人，好吧？
Be a nice guy, all right?

242
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:39,030
你看新闻了吗？
Have you seen the news?

243
00:23:40,010 --> 00:23:42,600
马德诺那个人渣又无法无天了
This fucking jerk Madano is on the loose again.

244
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:46,340
看得出他是个聪明人
Made him out to be a wiseguy.

245
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:50,280
他们把他和我们联系上了
And they connected him to us.

246
00:23:51,690 --> 00:23:55,670
那个人渣要是拥有了纽约市就成不了黑帮了
That piece of shit couldn't be a gangster if he owned New York City.

247
00:23:57,250 --> 00:23:58,340
抓到他
Get him.

248
00:23:59,850 --> 00:24:02,120
我们没法承受公众的压力
We can't stand this publicity.

249
00:24:06,190 --> 00:24:07,530
我去找到他
I'll get him.

250
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:22,970
你有狗粮吗？
You got any puppy dog food?

251
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:25,300
在这里，你要什么我有什么
Right here. I got anything you want.

252
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:27,510
我有这东西
I got this stuff here...

253
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:32,650
看上去它很需要这个，给它吃吃看
Looks like he needs this. Give him some of this.

254
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:36,990
这些都不是产自泽西吧？我可不要有放射性的东西
None of this is from Jersey, right? I don't want no radioactive stuff.

255
00:24:37,390 --> 00:24:38,760
我也不怪你
I don't blame you.

256
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:02,160
你在这里干什么？
What are you doing down here?

257
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:06,970
你好啊
How you doing?

258
00:25:07,290 --> 00:25:08,710
还好
It's okay.

259
00:25:08,990 --> 00:25:12,010
- 我听说你取得了驾照  - 我得到了什么呢？狗证？
- I heard you got your license.  - What'd I get, a dog license?

260
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:14,450
我听说你还会操纵人了
I heard you just got your button.

261
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:18,050
你依然是一个恶贯满盈的罪犯
You're still a dirtbag criminal.

262
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:22,280
你知道有多少我认识的警察让我手下的人变得像阉割过的一样？
You know how many cops I know that make my guys look like altar boys?

263
00:25:23,330 --> 00:25:24,850
根本不是这样的
Ain't it the truth.

264
00:25:25,430 --> 00:25:27,360
我们生活在一个悲哀的世界中
Sad world we live in.

265
00:25:28,330 --> 00:25:30,270
这是我们的世界，我们说了算
It's our world. It's our system.

266
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:33,900
- 什么？我又要听你说这些陈腔滥词？ - 伙计，这是我们应该做的
- What, I got to hear this again?  - Come on, we got to do this.

267
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:38,810
自从我们还小的时候…
Ever since we was little...

268
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:41,640
…我从来，从来没想过要…
...I never, ever tried to, like, you know...

269
00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:45,110
…表现得样样比你强，而且我也从来没比你强过
...act 1 ike I was better than you at anything. And I never was.

270
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:49,110
你说我很“幸运”，我从来都没那么幸运，一切只是发自内心的愿望
You called me "lucky. " I wasn't lucky, man, it was just deep desire.

271
00:25:49,450 --> 00:25:52,820
我总是愿意付出任何代价让事情圆满
I was always willing to do whatever it took to get the job done.

272
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,480
你知道，这见事…
You know, this thing...

273
00:25:55,290 --> 00:25:59,960
你认为这是公事，可我绝不把它当公事看
You think it's the department. I don't give a fuck about the department.

274
00:26:01,030 --> 00:26:03,080
它，对于我来说，是私事
This, to me, is personal.

275
00:26:06,370 --> 00:26:07,790
你总是一成不变，吉诺
You'll never change, Gino.

276
00:26:16,650 --> 00:26:18,230
我们走
Come on, let's get out of here.

277
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:37,520
啊，我操！
Aw, fuck me!

278
00:26:38,490 --> 00:26:39,930
他在哪儿？
Where is he?

279
00:26:40,230 --> 00:26:42,890
- 我不知道  - 你就从来没看到过他？
- I don't know.  - You haven't seen or heard from him?

280
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:46,260
拜托，他是我兄弟，我迟早会见到他的
Come on, he's my brother. I'll see him sooner or later.

281
00:26:46,570 --> 00:26:48,800
他疯了，去惹上这种事
He's crazy, sticking that crap up his nose.

282
00:26:49,070 --> 00:26:53,630
我就知道事情会变成这样，我会给你打电话的，我发誓
I knew this would happen. I'll call you, on my mother's eyes.

283
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:58,270
找到他，不然下次我们来，你就得跟我们走了
Find him. Otherwise, next time we come here, you're coming with us.

284
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:12,610
我需要他，我真的需要这只猪
I need them. I need this shit, right?

285
00:27:12,930 --> 00:27:14,510
尼克，咖啡
Nicki, coffee.

286
00:27:36,950 --> 00:27:37,770
他不在这儿
He's not here.

287
00:27:38,250 --> 00:27:40,730
马德诺先生，你身体还好吗？
Mr. Madano, how's your health?

288
00:27:41,110 --> 00:27:42,440
我说了他不在这儿
I said, he's not here.

289
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,180
我相信你
I believe you.

290
00:27:45,190 --> 00:27:47,850
但是如果你不介意的话，我想和你谈谈
But if you don't mind, I'd like to talk to you.

291
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:18,980
求求你，别杀了我儿子

292
00:28:20,110 --> 00:28:23,350
上帝啊，别让他伤了我的孩子

293
00:28:26,690 --> 00:28:27,850
他杀了鲍勃
He killed Bobby.

294
00:28:28,490 --> 00:28:30,080
当着他老婆和孩子的面
In front of his wife and kids.

295
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:31,410
鲍勃对他做了什么？
What did Bobby do to him?

296
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:33,290
鲍勃什么也没做
Bobby didn't do nothing.

297
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:35,620
警察都做了些什么把他逼疯了
What did the police do to make him crazy?

298
00:28:35,970 --> 00:28:39,450
两条街区以外，他又杀了一个妇女，无差别杀人！
Two blocks over, he just killed another woman, random!

299
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:41,120
一定是什么把他弄疯了
Something make him crazy.

300
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:46,230
鲍勃的孩子们就眼睁睁地看着理查杀了他们的父亲
Bobby's children watched Richie kill their father.

301
00:28:47,610 --> 00:28:49,300
你们和我一样明白…
Now, you know as well as I do...

302
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:52,510
…理查总是喜欢干坏事，从小就这样
...Richie was always into bad things, even when we were kids.

303
00:28:52,770 --> 00:28:54,210
但也从来没像这样疯狂
But never crazy like this.

304
00:28:54,450 --> 00:28:56,410
他现在开始吸毒了，他神智不清了
He's on drugs now. He's lost his mind.

305
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:58,310
如果你们见到了理查…
Now, if you've seen Richie...

306
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:02,510
…或者知道什么我不知道的事情，最好告诉我
...or you know something I don't, you better tell me.

307
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:11,250
当我来这里的时候…
When I came here...

308
00:29:11,530 --> 00:29:13,190
我是个地铁修理工
...I got a job repairing the subway.

309
00:29:15,230 --> 00:29:17,660
房子依然，工作依然
Same house, same job, ever since.

310
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:20,760
每晚我都回家吃饭
I come home for dinner every night.

311
00:29:21,470 --> 00:29:23,440
快五十年了
Almost 50 years.

312
00:29:24,710 --> 00:29:25,830
你还不相信我？
And you don't believe me?

313
00:29:26,110 --> 00:29:27,340
我相信你
I believe you.

314
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:30,680
就算当初我还是个小混混的时候…
And even then, when I was a punk kid...

315
00:29:30,910 --> 00:29:33,010
…我们也彼此信任
...I believed you and you believed me.

316
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:37,710
我怎样才能阻止你杀我儿子？
How can I keep you from killing my son?

317
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:41,140
你叫理查找一个律师
You tell Richie to get a lawyer.

318
00:29:42,690 --> 00:29:44,620
叫律师说服他自首
Have him turn himself in.

319
00:29:46,130 --> 00:29:47,520
如果不的话…
If not...

320
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:49,380
…我会杀了他
...I'm going to kill him.

321
00:30:22,150 --> 00:30:23,310
“恰好”
"Just... "

322
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:28,390
“恰好及时”
"... in time... "

323
00:30:30,530 --> 00:30:31,860
开门
Open the door.

324
00:30:34,470 --> 00:30:35,900
你们两个人好吗？
How you two doing?

325
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:42,170
里卡，我要离开一段时间，知道吗？
Rica, I ain't seen you around in a while, you know?

326
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:45,840
你要怎么办？退休还是什么？
What'd you do, retire or something?

327
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:49,610
说我退休也无妨
I guess you could say I retired.

328
00:30:49,710 --> 00:30:51,410
在音像店找了个工作
Got a job at the video store.

329
00:30:55,150 --> 00:30:58,480
- 正在试着过回正常的生活  - 正常的生活？
- Just trying to get back to normal.  - Normal?

330
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:01,380
“正常”是什么意思？
What do you mean by "normal"?

331
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:06,720
你是做什么的，里卡？你是做什么的？你就回答“没有”？
What'd you do, Rica? What'd you do? You just say no?

332
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:11,460
你是做什么的？她叫什么名字？南希他妈的瑞布什？
What are you, what's-her-name, Nancy-fucking-Reabush?

333
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:14,020
不是的，理查，不是那样的
No, Rich, it's not like that.

334
00:31:23,610 --> 00:31:29,880
- 你不会只对我说个“不”字吧？ - 不会的
- You wouldn't "just say no" to me, would you?  - No!

335
00:31:49,530 --> 00:31:50,720
日子过得还好吗？
How you doing?

336
00:31:51,030 --> 00:31:54,230
大牌儿警官，来打我的蛋蛋来了？
Officer Big Shot, come to bust my balls?

337
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:58,280
他可是个大侦探，在哪儿工作的？麻醉药里吗？
This here is a detective! In what, narcotics now?

338
00:31:58,970 --> 00:32:01,130
我要你们都好好地对他
Now I want you all to be very nice.

339
00:32:01,410 --> 00:32:04,310
告诉这该死的侦探任何他想知道的事
Tell this fucking mamaluke anything he wants to know.

340
00:32:04,550 --> 00:32:06,100
维尼，过来
Vinnie, come over here.

341
00:32:06,450 --> 00:32:10,910
你不应该对我那样讲话，我们还不熟
You shouldn't talk to me that way. We don't know each other so good.

342
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:14,880
当理查已经在做爱的时候你还光屁股呢
You were still sucking your thumb when Richie was sucking dicks.

343
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:17,080
不过你的语气还是不应该那么重
But still, you shouldn't talk so tough.

344
00:32:17,330 --> 00:32:19,480
如果理查在这儿的话，你绝不会说那样的话吧？
If Richie was here you wouldn't talk that shit.

345
00:32:19,930 --> 00:32:22,820
但是他不在这儿，你知道为什么他不在这儿？
But he's not here. You know why he's not here?

346
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:26,650
因为他是个超级王八蛋加二百五
Because he's a chickenshit fucking pussy asshole.

347
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:31,530
你别对我的老主顾动手动脚的，鸟人
Don't go pushing my patrons around, you prick.

348
00:32:31,910 --> 00:32:34,920
鸟人？你朝四周看看，说这话不是亵渎神灵吗？
Prick? Look around. Is this the setting for profanity?

349
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:36,830
去你的！
Fuck you!

350
00:32:37,950 --> 00:32:40,170
圣经啊，你好吗，伙计？
Benny the Book. How are you, buddy?

351
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:45,570
你们不会在这里将妈妈贝尔用做非法用途吧？
You wouldn't be here using Ma Bell for illegal means?

352
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:48,250
赌博可是非法行为啊
Bookmaking's an illegal activity.

353
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:52,580
你难道不知道理查买下这个地方贩卖毒品吧？
You also wouldn't know Richie owns this place and sells narcotics here.

354
00:32:52,850 --> 00:32:56,220
因为他是个该死的，喜欢猥亵儿童的流氓！
Because he's a fucking puke who likes to pervert kids.

355
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:58,250
毒品？这儿可没人吸那个啊
Drugs? Nobody uses drugs around here.

356
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:01,950
你什么都不知道，对吧？
You don't know nothing, do you?

357
00:33:08,430 --> 00:33:09,870
有人看到过理查吗？
Anybody seen Richie?

358
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:15,400
有人知道为什么理查杀了鲍勃吗？
Anyone know why Richie did Bobby Lupo?

359
00:33:18,210 --> 00:33:19,230
我可不认识他
I don't know cazzo.

360
00:33:21,650 --> 00:33:23,110
带着警徽和枪的高个子
Big man with a badge and gun.

361
00:33:24,850 --> 00:33:25,980
说出密码，王八蛋
What's the password, asshole?

362
00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:31,050
你在这儿干什么？
What are you doing here?

363
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:34,650
- 你不是维托的朋友吗？ - 我有很多朋友
- Aren't you Vito's friend?  - I got lots of friends.

364
00:33:34,690 --> 00:33:36,810
你在朋友间跳来跳去的，对吧？
You jump around a little bit. Is that it?

365
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:39,720
这位是谁，你的女朋友？
Who's this one over here, your girlfriend?

366
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,480
你知道吗，兄弟
You know what, Cool Breeze?

367
00:33:43,970 --> 00:33:47,990
总有一天你这张俏皮嘴会给你惹得一身的麻烦
Someday your wise mouth is going to get your body in a lot of trouble.

368
00:33:48,310 --> 00:33:50,790
- 你是哪里人，菲诺奇？ - 是阿蒂卡
- Where you from, finocchi?  - Attica.

369
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:54,400
你不可能是布鲁克林人，因为我们不是那样说话的
You couldn't be from Brooklyn, because we don't talk like that.

370
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:57,570
纹身仔，这个人要是没了警徽和枪就连个屁都不是了
Tattoo, this guy's nothing without that badge and gun.

371
00:33:58,250 --> 00:34:01,610
你不能进来，快滚出去！
You can't come back here. Get the fuck out of here!

372
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:10,080
这儿都有些什么呢？这是什么玩意儿？
What do we got here? What is this shit?

373
00:34:15,490 --> 00:34:17,420
这是谁的热狗？你的吗？
Whose hot dog is this? Is that yours?

374
00:34:17,830 --> 00:34:20,320
要是没有警徽和那把枪，你就死定了
Without that badge and gun, you'd be dead.

375
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:22,460
快从这儿滚出去！
Get the fuck out of here!

376
00:34:23,830 --> 00:34:25,860
这儿有很多拳击的大事记嘛
I've noticed a lot of boxing memorabilia.

377
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:29,030
到处都是手套
We got some gloves over here.

378
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:32,030
到处都是照片，那个拳击手是谁？
Pictures everywhere. Who's the boxer?

379
00:34:32,670 --> 00:34:34,870
你？你就是那个硬汉？
You're the boxer? You a tough guy?

380
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:38,340
- 真屌啊  - 是吗？你会点什么？
- Tough enough.  - Really? What could you do?

381
00:34:38,610 --> 00:34:39,550
就你？
To you?

382
00:34:46,290 --> 00:34:49,090
我心情开始变差了
I'm starting to get in a bad mood.

383
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:53,910
也许就只一种心情的波动，荷尔蒙，或者是一种压抑已久的欲望
Maybe it's a mood swing, my hormones, or a need to impose my will.

384
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:57,620
我要你告诉他们叫他们到桌子上去
I want you tell these finocchis to get on the fucking table.

385
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:02,490
叫他们到桌子上去
Tell them to get up on the fucking table.

386
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:07,130
你疯了吗？你会杀了楼上的人！
Are you totally nuts?! You could've killed somebody upstairs!

387
00:35:07,410 --> 00:35:09,960
- 但是楼上可没人  - 你又怎么知道的？
- But there's nobody upstairs!  - How would you know?

388
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:11,730
你搜索过这个酒吧吗？
Did you bust in the joint?

389
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:15,100
不记得了
I don't recall.

390
00:35:15,370 --> 00:35:18,170
能让他那么有种的也就是那警徽和枪
The only balls he has is that badge and gun.

391
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:28,180
这就是我的枪！
Here's my gun!

392
00:35:28,650 --> 00:35:32,150
游戏公平了，这是我的警徽
Fair game now, okay? And here's my badge!

393
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:35,520
这是你们的奖杯，这是你们的奖杯，好了吧？
This is your trophy. This is your trophy, okay?

394
00:35:35,790 --> 00:35:37,320
过来拿啊
Come and get it.

395
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:40,220
叫那些人来拿呀
Tell one of your citriolis to come and get it.

396
00:35:40,530 --> 00:35:43,060
拿到警徽者重奖5000美元
I offer 5000 for that badge, right now.

397
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,600
有人看见理查了吗？
Anybody see Richie?

398
00:35:49,410 --> 00:35:52,270
有没有人知道为什么理查要杀鲍勃？
Anybody know why Richie did Bobby Lupo?

399
00:35:54,010 --> 00:35:56,170
小子，你想过我这关？
Fuckface, you want to get by me?

400
00:35:56,510 --> 00:36:00,450
只有两件事能阻止你：恐惧和常识
There's only two things stopping you: Fear and common sense.

401
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:02,710
我现在要把你的头砍下来！
And I'll cut your fucking head off!

402
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:15,320
你这个操蛋，你把我的牙打掉了！
You motherfucker! You knocked my teeth out!

403
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:19,150
嘿，拿球杆的，给我上！
Hey, Sticks, come on!

404
00:36:58,470 --> 00:36:59,260
妈的！
Motherfucker!

405
00:37:13,650 --> 00:37:14,730
我是维托理奥的人
I'm with Vittorio.

406
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:17,340
也就意味着你不能碰我
So that means you can't touch me.

407
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:21,670
没错，我忘了
That's right. I forgot.

408
00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:30,220
你好吗，伙计？
How you doing, buddy?

409
00:37:30,830 --> 00:37:34,920
- 我想和你兄弟谈谈  - 他会找你谈谈的，你这只猪！
- I want to talk to your brother.  - He'll want to talk to you.

410
00:37:36,170 --> 00:37:38,090
你在干什么？你不能这样做
What are you doing? You don't want to do that!

411
00:37:40,210 --> 00:37:43,170
你去告诉你兄弟我会把他的头砍下来往他喉咙里小便
Tell him I'll cut off his head and piss down his throat.

412
00:37:43,430 --> 00:37:44,330
去你的！
Fuck you!

413
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:00,220
有人看到过理查吗？
Anybody seen Richie?

414
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:06,620
我会经常光临，直到有人记得看到过理查！
I'm going to keep coming back until somebody remembers seeing Richie!

415
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:39,250
有什么消息？
So what's the latest?

416
00:40:39,660 --> 00:40:42,850
消息是：满城都是警察在我们的店里守侯伏击
The cops are all over town, hitting every business we own.

417
00:40:43,130 --> 00:40:45,060
我派出所有的手下上街去找那个杂种
All my guys are looking for this bastard.

418
00:40:45,830 --> 00:40:48,730
维托理奥，他正在无法无天地杀人！
Vittorio, he's killing people like it was free.

419
00:40:49,070 --> 00:40:51,430
等我游好了我要去科诺吃饭
When I'm through, I'm going to Cono's for dinner.

420
00:40:51,670 --> 00:40:53,030
你务必找到吉诺
You find Gino.

421
00:40:53,340 --> 00:40:56,030
叫他…就叫他去那里见我
Tell him to... Ask him to meet me there.

422
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:58,700
你去找到理查，不管用什么方法
And you find Richie. I don't care how.

423
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:00,860
就是要找到他
You just find him.

424
00:41:01,410 --> 00:41:02,850
我会的
I'll find him.

425
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:11,340
- 告诉乔伊老鼠的事  - 什么老鼠？
- Tell Joey about the mouse.  - What mouse?

426
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:15,080
- 他现在不是个灭鼠专家吗？ - 那老鼠是怎么回事？
- Why, is Joey an exterminator now?  - What about the mouse?

427
00:41:15,390 --> 00:41:19,380
我家里有一只老鼠，我花了八百美元去抓它
I got a mouse in my house. I pay $800 so I can chase a mouse around.

428
00:41:19,730 --> 00:41:20,950
就为了杀了那杂种耗子
Shoot this rat bastard.

429
00:41:21,230 --> 00:41:24,620
那老鼠只有这么点，你叫我用枪去打？
The mouse is about this fucking big. I'm going to shoot him?

430
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:26,880
朝地上开一枪，有可能杀掉楼下邻居
Shoot him through the floor, you kill a neighbor.

431
00:41:27,740 --> 00:41:29,660
我们去买捕鼠器吧
Let's go by Chas the Chair.

432
00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:32,460
我想那老鼠要比你聪明吧
I think the mouse is smarter than you are.

433
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:35,790
- 就用枪打吧  - 不准再说耗子的事！
- Shoot this rat.  - Shut up about the fucking mouse!

434
00:41:44,750 --> 00:41:46,470
谢谢你赶来
Thanks for coming.

435
00:41:46,750 --> 00:41:49,110
- 请坐  - 坐在我看得见你的地方
- Pull up a chair.  - Sit where I can see you.

436
00:41:55,420 --> 00:41:58,020
你们警察为什么要满城地搜我的地方？
What are your guys...? Busting my balls all over town?

437
00:41:58,330 --> 00:42:01,260
坏了我的生意，这样不对，吉诺
Hurting my business. That ain't right, Gino.

438
00:42:02,330 --> 00:42:06,600
嗯，你是知道的，维托理奥，我是想告诉你…
Well, you know, Vittorio, I was meaning to tell you...

439
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,590
我真的不是很喜欢你
...I really don't like you.

440
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:11,660
并且我从来都没喜欢过你
And I never really did.

441
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:16,040
如果你跌落悬崖或者被捕了，终日铁窗生涯
If you fall off a cliff or get arrested, rot in jail for life...

442
00:42:16,340 --> 00:42:18,770
我一点都不在乎，好吗？
...I really don't care, all right?

443
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:26,110
对于鲍勃的事我深感抱歉
I'm sorry about what happened to Bobby.

444
00:42:26,750 --> 00:42:27,900
我知道你很爱他
I know how you loved him.

445
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:31,040
但是我知道你刚才的一句话是言不由衷的
But I know you don't mean one word you just said.

446
00:42:32,690 --> 00:42:34,050
你是我们的一分子
You're one of us.

447
00:42:34,330 --> 00:42:35,220
家人
Family.

448
00:42:37,630 --> 00:42:39,050
我来告诉你
Let me tell you something.

449
00:42:39,530 --> 00:42:42,460
我不是你们的一分子，我也不是你们的人
I'm not one of you, and I'm not with you.

450
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:55,730
吉诺，等等
Gino, wait up.

451
00:42:59,140 --> 00:43:00,940
你怎么可以那样和一个老人说话？
Why you talking to the old man like that?

452
00:43:01,210 --> 00:43:04,610
因为他是你的头儿，不是我的，懂我的意思吗？
Because he's your boss, not mine. You know what I'm saying?

453
00:43:04,850 --> 00:43:06,410
我要告诉你一件事
I want to tell you something.

454
00:43:07,050 --> 00:43:08,750
你还记得皮诺叔叔，对吧？
You remember Uncle Pino, right?

455
00:43:09,390 --> 00:43:10,980
是啊，那个高个儿
Yeah. The big guy.

456
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:12,580
有一次…
One time...

457
00:43:13,220 --> 00:43:17,320
当我还小的时候，皮诺叔叔打算带我去看电影
...when I was a kid, Pino was going to take me to the movies.

458
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,960
我们先去了糖果店，叫麦提阿莫的一家店，还记得吗？
First, we go to the candy store. Mettiamo's, remember it?

459
00:43:21,230 --> 00:43:22,320
谁会忘记呢？
Who the hell could forget?

460
00:43:22,730 --> 00:43:25,670
我们看见有个人抢劫那家店，大把大把地往口袋里塞钱
We see this guy filling up his pockets with this and that.

461
00:43:26,070 --> 00:43:27,470
皮诺叔叔抓住他的喉咙
Pino grabs him by the throat...

462
00:43:27,740 --> 00:43:30,260
把他拖到外面，狠狠地给了他一顿拳脚
...drags him outside, throws him a beating.

463
00:43:32,110 --> 00:43:35,830
然后把他扔到后备箱里，开车去电影院了
Puts him in the trunk of the car, drives to the movies.

464
00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:37,600
他还去看电影？
He went to the movies?

465
00:43:39,420 --> 00:43:42,810
在影院里，我没有在看电影，我一直在想…
In the movies, I'm not watching. I'm thinking to myself:

466
00:43:43,090 --> 00:43:45,840
“后备箱里的那个人会怎么样呢？”
"What about this guy in the trunk?"

467
00:43:48,030 --> 00:43:51,950
我想：叔叔杀了他，他已经死了
I think to myself, "He killed him. He's dead. "

468
00:43:52,260 --> 00:43:54,620
我跑向皮诺叔叔，说：“你把那个人杀了”
I run to Pino, I says, "You killed the guy. "

469
00:43:54,930 --> 00:43:58,520
皮诺叔叔烦了，就把我带到车前，给了我钥匙，然后说：
Pino's bored, brings me around the front, gives me the keys, he says:

470
00:43:58,940 --> 00:44:00,520
“做你该做的事”
"Do what you got to do. "

471
00:44:00,930 --> 00:44:03,690
我说：“我？我能做什么？我才九岁”
I says, "Me? What am I going to do? I'm nine years old. "

472
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:07,160
他给我钥匙，我打开了后备箱
He gives me the keys. I open the trunk.

473
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:09,930
- 我看见一个人盯着我看  - 你一定被吓到了
- I see a man staring at me.  - You must've been scared.

474
00:44:10,270 --> 00:44:12,530
皮诺叔叔就在旁边，有什么好怕的？
I've got Pino over here. What am I scared of?

475
00:44:12,870 --> 00:44:16,370
我对那个人说：“嘿，你，给我滚出来！”
I says to the guy, "Hey you, get the fuck out of here!"

476
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:20,250
眨眼之间他就不见了
I blink. He's in Hoboken.

477
00:44:20,510 --> 00:44:21,450
就像离弦之箭？
He took off like a shot?

478
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:23,010
简直像只鸟
Like a bird.

479
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:24,810
你一定把他吓得屁滚尿流
You scared the shit out of him.

480
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:27,880
那个狗娘养的
The son of a bitch.

481
00:44:29,290 --> 00:44:32,880
九岁啊，我看着皮诺叔叔，心里想：
Nine years old, I'm looking at Pino, I'm thinking to myself:

482
00:44:33,230 --> 00:44:35,220
“天啊！叔叔真是个伟大的人”
"My God, what a great guy. "

483
00:44:36,730 --> 00:44:38,820
我一直想做个聪明人
I always wanted to be a wiseguy.

484
00:44:39,130 --> 00:44:41,070
看看我们，在神之下
Look at us now, under God.

485
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:44,560
谁会想到我会成为一名警察？
Who'd have thought that I would've become a cop?

486
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:46,600
嘿，幸运儿，你要知道…
Hey, Lucky, you know...

487
00:44:48,140 --> 00:44:50,040
对我来说，神只是个操纵者
...to me God's a puppeteer.

488
00:44:51,310 --> 00:44:53,500
我们只不过在任他操纵而已
We're on the end of the strings.

489
00:44:53,810 --> 00:44:56,830
但是神有一种独特的幽默感，这你得承认
But God has a strange sense of humor, you got to admit.

490
00:44:58,320 --> 00:44:59,570
也许你是对的
Maybe you're right.

491
00:45:20,270 --> 00:45:23,530
理查，从你突然变成名人来判断…
Richie, judging by your sudden rise to stardom...

492
00:45:23,830 --> 00:45:26,860
…我打赌这上面应该有个牌子了
...I'll lay odds this one's got a make on it by now.

493
00:45:27,170 --> 00:45:29,870
理查，别！别这样，你在干什么？
Richie, don't! Don't! What are you doing?

494
00:45:31,180 --> 00:45:32,610
这就是一夜成名啊，宝贝儿
I'm an overnight success, baby.

495
00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:36,740
我要在这儿玩一会儿，有意见吗？
I'm going to crib here for a couple hours. Any problem with that?

496
00:46:13,150 --> 00:46:14,700
要我怎么相信那是真的？
How do I know that thing's real?

497
00:46:15,050 --> 00:46:18,770
我看上去不像是个正直的人吗？你能把我想得多坏呢？
Don't I look like an honest guy? How bad do you want to find out?

498
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:31,080
告诉她我来了，然后从我的视线里消失
Tell her I'm here, then get the fuck out of my sight.

499
00:46:34,340 --> 00:46:35,120
你好吗？
How you doing?

500
00:46:35,470 --> 00:46:37,560
想跟我说说你是怎么找到这儿的吗？
You want to tell me how you got up here?

501
00:46:37,830 --> 00:46:41,600
- 理查在哪里？ - 我什么都不知道
- Where's Richie?  - I don't know nothing from nothing.

502
00:46:41,900 --> 00:46:43,160
真的吗？
Is that right?

503
00:46:50,340 --> 00:46:51,710
你的饮料
Here's your drink.

504
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:53,070
我没点什么饮料啊
I didn't order no drink.

505
00:47:01,120 --> 00:47:03,560
警察整晚都在这里进进出出
Cops have been in and out of here all night.

506
00:47:03,790 --> 00:47:05,620
但是我要见的正是你
But it's you I been expecting.

507
00:47:05,930 --> 00:47:08,490
似乎为自己保留了最佳状态哦
IKind of figured you'd save the best for yourself.

508
00:47:08,830 --> 00:47:09,730
你好吗？
How you doing?

509
00:47:10,100 --> 00:47:12,620
我仍然可以搞得大汗淋漓哦，你呢？
I can still get it wet. How about you?

510
00:47:13,030 --> 00:47:13,970
我？
Me?

511
00:47:14,570 --> 00:47:16,500
真不能相信你还在用那张嘴吃饭
I can't believe you eat with that mouth.

512
00:47:20,410 --> 00:47:21,930
对于鲍勃我觉得非常遗憾
I feel bad about Bobby.

513
00:47:23,710 --> 00:47:25,960
你不知道你兄弟的杀人动机？
You don't know what reason your brother had?

514
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:28,500
就算我知道这件我不知道的事…
Even if I knew, which I don't...

515
00:47:28,780 --> 00:47:30,760
你没见过你兄弟，对吗？
And you haven't seen your brother. Right?

516
00:47:31,050 --> 00:47:33,030
最后一次是几天前了
Last time was a couple of days ago.

517
00:47:33,550 --> 00:47:36,910
他身边总是带着一个不同的女人，他最近的新欢是谁？
He's always with a different whore. Who's his latest special?

518
00:47:37,160 --> 00:47:39,620
从什么时候起开始关心我兄弟的风流韵事了？
Since when do I keep track of my brother's pumps?

519
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:41,380
一定非常艰难
Must be tough.

520
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:45,850
- 这位是谁？ - 哪位？
- Who's this one over here?  - Which one?

521
00:47:46,130 --> 00:47:48,390
就是你都可以用她的乳头拨电话的那个
The one with nipples you could dial a phone with.

522
00:47:48,970 --> 00:47:50,050
是泰利
Terry.

523
00:47:50,900 --> 00:47:51,590
怎么问起这个？
Why?

524
00:47:52,060 --> 00:47:54,530
我们废话少说，我要和你谈谈
Let's cut the bullshit. I got to talk to you.

525
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:56,930
你能把你的臭手从我身上拿开吗？
Would you get your fucking hands off me?

526
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:59,230
别在我的地方推推搡搡的
Don't push me around in my club!

527
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:01,460
你以为你在干什么？
What the fuck you think you're doing?

528
00:48:01,740 --> 00:48:03,540
我没叫你滚出这个地方吗？
Didn't I tell you to get out of here?

529
00:48:06,580 --> 00:48:08,870
你要用这种方式来闹场子吗？
Are you getting your rocks off this way?

530
00:48:09,150 --> 00:48:12,080
他们就是这样教你做警察的？妈的！
Is this what they teach you to do when you're a cop? Shit!

531
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:13,980
你在别处见到过你兄弟吗？
Have you seen your brother anywhere?

532
00:48:14,250 --> 00:48:17,650
没有，我告诉你一百遍了
No, I haven't. I've told you a million times.

533
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:20,050
你以为你在干什么？
What the flying fuck you think you're doing?

534
00:48:20,320 --> 00:48:21,850
你到底有没有见到过你兄弟？
Have you seen your brother anywhere?

535
00:48:22,130 --> 00:48:24,030
你是蠢猪吗？我说过了没有
Are you stupid? I already told you "no. "

536
00:48:24,590 --> 00:48:26,860
你为什么破坏我的办公室？
Why don't you just destroy my whole office?

537
00:48:27,330 --> 00:48:29,930
如果你是在找我的唇膏，它就在我的包里
If you're looking for my lipstick, it's in my bag.

538
00:48:35,010 --> 00:48:36,930
我受够了！
I've had enough of this.

539
00:48:39,010 --> 00:48:41,300
哦，看看我发现了什么？你有一把枪
Look what I found. You got a gun.

540
00:48:41,580 --> 00:48:43,640
- 我可是有执照的  - 执照呢？
- I got a license for that.  - Where is it?

541
00:48:43,910 --> 00:48:45,030
我的狗把它吃了
My dog ate it.

542
00:48:45,320 --> 00:48:48,040
我来告诉你，这可是要判一年监禁的，沙利文法案
Let me tell you, this is a year in jail. Sullivan Act.

543
00:48:48,350 --> 00:48:50,240
你以为一年很好过吗？
You think a year's a piece of cake?

544
00:48:50,620 --> 00:48:52,580
- 你不是很聪明吗？ - 已经很晚了
- Aren't you smart.  - Look, it's getting late.

545
00:48:53,120 --> 00:48:57,740
整个晚上我遇到的都是些聋的、傻的、瞎的人
All night I've been running into people who are deaf, dumb and blind.

546
00:48:58,020 --> 00:49:00,710
知道我接下来要做什么吗？我要逮捕你
IKnow what I'm going to do? I'm going to arrest you.

547
00:49:02,170 --> 00:49:03,850
你要逮捕我？凭什么？
You're going to arrest me? For what?

548
00:49:04,120 --> 00:49:05,060
这怎么可以？
How does it work?

549
00:49:05,340 --> 00:49:08,290
我给了你一点启发了，你全忘了？
I give you a little head and you forget the whole thing?

550
00:49:08,830 --> 00:49:11,260
我绝不会忘，你才没那么好
It won't make me forget. You were never that good.

551
00:49:11,540 --> 00:49:13,620
你真该死，吉诺
Go fuck yourself, Gino.

552
00:49:13,900 --> 00:49:14,960
你被逮捕了
You're under arrest.

553
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:20,570
我需要一辆新的货车
I'm going to be needing a new go-cart.

554
00:49:21,710 --> 00:49:23,470
要带脚踏板的
Something with some stomp.

555
00:49:24,310 --> 00:49:25,280
还有扫描仪
And a scanner.

556
00:49:25,710 --> 00:49:29,150
你的礼节呢？他们在对你说话呢
Where the fuck are your manners? The man's talking to you.

557
00:49:32,650 --> 00:49:36,050
楼顶的停车场上有个GNX
There's a GNX over on the top floor, on the parking garage.

558
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:40,260
十号港，带上扫描仪，装上电线，带回来
Bay 10. Take the scanner, wire it, bring it back.

559
00:49:42,660 --> 00:49:45,460
我们要开个派对了
We're going to have us a little party.

560
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:48,200
我们要开个小派对了，一个小型晚会
We'll have a little party, a little soiree.

561
00:49:50,100 --> 00:49:51,080
咬一口鸡肉
Bite off a couple chicks.

562
00:49:51,740 --> 00:49:54,260
然后躺着享受美女的服务
We can all get laid, get blowjobs.

563
00:49:55,410 --> 00:49:59,670
嘿，理查，你知道我从一九六九年就没上过女人了？
Hey, Richie, you know I haven't gotten no pussy since 1969.

564
00:50:02,520 --> 00:50:04,440
你从一九六九年就没上过女人？
You ain't got any pussy since 1969?

565
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:07,270
那你都在做些什么啊？混日子吗？
What've you been doing? Jerkin' the gherkin?

566
00:50:09,090 --> 00:50:12,110
拜托，老兄，那样好冷，别管他嘛
Come on, man. That's cold. Leave him alone.

567
00:50:13,190 --> 00:50:15,170
你都在干些什么啊？
What've you been doing?

568
00:50:18,390 --> 00:50:21,020
鲍勃，弄瓶啤酒来
Bobby Arms. Get me a beer.

569
00:50:22,860 --> 00:50:24,790
你不用推我
You don't have to push me.

570
00:50:25,030 --> 00:50:26,660
通常当你被捕以后，你可以打一通电话
Usually when you're arrested you can use a phone.

571
00:50:27,270 --> 00:50:28,860
你在开玩笑吗？
Are you kidding?

572
00:50:32,150 --> 00:50:35,070
你还没告诉我逮捕我的原因
You have not even told me what I've been arrested for.

573
00:50:35,610 --> 00:50:38,200
让我想想，我们能做点什么呢？
Let me see here. What could we do?

574
00:50:38,610 --> 00:50:42,840
- 240.25怎么样？ - 那是什么？
- How about 240.25?  - What's that?

575
00:50:43,210 --> 00:50:44,680
卖淫啊，宝贝儿
Prostitution, honey.

576
00:50:44,710 --> 00:50:46,150
你开什么玩笑？
Are you fucking kidding me?!

577
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:47,920
快放我出去！
Let me out of here right now!

578
00:50:48,290 --> 00:50:50,220
我告诉你我要逮捕你的
I told you I was going to do this.

579
00:50:51,290 --> 00:50:53,480
什么？你脑子有毛病了吗？
What? Are you out of your fucking mind?

580
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:56,280
我告诉你我是认真的
I told you I was not kidding.

581
00:50:56,560 --> 00:50:58,430
现在你的记忆怎么样了？
Now, how's your memory?

582
00:50:58,900 --> 00:50:59,950
谁是洛葛仙妮？
Who is Roxanne?

583
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:02,690
你真的把我惹火了
You are really starting to piss me off.

584
00:51:03,630 --> 00:51:05,860
杰克，你在路边看到过这个女人吗？
Did you ever find this one on the street?

585
00:51:06,140 --> 00:51:07,070
许多次了
Many times.

586
00:51:07,300 --> 00:51:08,790
- 她多少钱？ - 十美元
- How much was she?  - $ 10.

587
00:51:09,070 --> 00:51:10,790
才十美元啊，朋友
Ten bucks this, friend.

588
00:51:11,070 --> 00:51:13,400
去你的，我真不能相信你真的做得出来
Fuck you! I can't believe you're doing this.

589
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:16,860
我真的有点失望，我以为你至少也能卖个十五美元的
I'm kind of disappointed. I thought you could get at least 15.

590
00:51:19,150 --> 00:51:22,070
吉诺，去你的！让我出去！
Gino, you fuck! Get me out of here!

591
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:31,340
来，查斯，再喝杯饮料
Come on, Chas. Have another drink.

592
00:51:39,860 --> 00:51:42,020
说说你和那个警察之间的故事
What's the story with you and that cop?

593
00:51:44,660 --> 00:51:46,260
谁？吉诺？
Who? Gino?

594
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:51,500
不是，是你打死的那个，是因为公事吗？
The one you popped. Was that business?

595
00:51:52,010 --> 00:51:53,600
还是因为私事？
Or was it personal?

596
00:51:57,440 --> 00:51:58,780
是私人的公事
It was personal business.

597
00:52:04,580 --> 00:52:05,710
妈的！
Holy shit!

598
00:52:05,990 --> 00:52:08,450
你为什么要问我生意上的事？
Why are you fucking asking me about my business?

599
00:52:08,790 --> 00:52:10,450
理查，警察来了！警察！
Richie, cops! Cops!

600
00:52:11,290 --> 00:52:12,420
你背叛我？
You rat me out?

601
00:52:12,860 --> 00:52:13,790
没有
Never.

602
00:52:14,030 --> 00:52:14,860
你这个叛徒！
You rat bastard!

603
00:52:15,300 --> 00:52:16,720
我从来没背叛过你
I'd never rat you out.

604
00:52:17,960 --> 00:52:19,400
我就让你从你的悲哀中解放吧
I'll put you out of your misery.

605
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:21,020
求求你，不要！
Please, don't!

606
00:52:30,610 --> 00:52:32,630
- 把手举起来！ - 不许动！
- Hands up!  - Nobody move!

607
00:52:33,880 --> 00:52:37,610
简直不能相信，你杀他干什么？他又没背叛我们
I don't believe it! Why did you shoot him? He didn't rat us out.

608
00:53:37,930 --> 00:53:38,750
你好吗？
How you doing?

609
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:42,300
你逮捕派翠西亚只是因为她没帮你找到理查？
You only arrest Patricia because she no help you find Richie.

610
00:53:42,710 --> 00:53:46,200
反正都一样，也许我们该进去谈谈
Just the same, maybe you could come in and we'll talk a minute.

611
00:53:50,780 --> 00:53:52,530
请在这里就座
If you'd sit down right over here.

612
00:54:05,050 --> 00:54:07,210
这件事我很难启齿
This is difficult for me to say.

613
00:54:07,960 --> 00:54:10,450
对于在你家的行为我深感抱歉
I'm sorry for the way I behaved in your home.

614
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:11,780
我知道这样很没礼貌
I know it was disrespectful.

615
00:54:12,060 --> 00:54:14,150
你对我来说一直像个父亲一样
You always been like a father to me.

616
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:17,390
如果你告诉我…
If you tell me...

617
00:54:18,300 --> 00:54:21,630
…你一直没见过理查，我相信你，但是我们有困难
...that you haven't seen Richie, I believe you. We got problems.

618
00:54:26,410 --> 00:54:27,900
我知道…
I know that it's...

619
00:54:28,410 --> 00:54:30,570
没人想亲手埋葬自己的儿子
No man wants to bury his son.

620
00:54:32,650 --> 00:54:33,840
而且我也知道…
And I know...

621
00:54:34,580 --> 00:54:36,780
…没人愿意承认他的儿子…
...no man wants to admit that his son...

622
00:54:37,050 --> 00:54:39,380
已经变成了一个毫无用处的人
...has become something the world can do without.

623
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:43,080
但是我很担心…
But I'm very afraid...

624
00:54:44,660 --> 00:54:47,420
…每时每刻都在为身边的人担心
...every moment, for everyone around us.

625
00:54:49,660 --> 00:54:51,060
我祈祷…
I pray...

626
00:54:51,830 --> 00:54:53,530
希望这一切快点结束
...for this to end.

627
00:54:56,170 --> 00:54:58,090
我知道你想说什么
I know what you're trying to say.

628
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:03,700
别担心，别担心

629
00:55:10,320 --> 00:55:11,930
我不得不…
I'm going to have to...

630
00:55:13,290 --> 00:55:15,380
…要求你今晚就住在市区
...make you stay downtown tonight.

631
00:55:31,700 --> 00:55:34,690
杰瑞，那是抢劫，不是贩毒
Jerry, that's robbery, not narcotics.

632
00:55:35,930 --> 00:55:38,870
找丹齐格谈谈然后再来找我
Talk to Donziger and get back to me.

633
00:55:39,540 --> 00:55:40,870
我要和你谈谈
I'll talk to you.

634
00:55:58,190 --> 00:55:59,990
这看上去熟悉吗？
Does this look familiar?

635
00:56:08,700 --> 00:56:10,460
不行，我要是帮你了，他会杀了我的
I can't. I help you any way, he'll kill me.

636
00:56:11,070 --> 00:56:12,690
拜托，他是你的亲兄弟啊
Come on. He's your own brother!

637
00:56:12,970 --> 00:56:16,160
他简直就像个吸尘器，他一次能吸三到四克毒品
He's a vacuum. He sucks up 3 to 4 grams a pass.

638
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:18,760
那么大的量对理性思维可没什么帮助
That much crack doesn't promote rational thought.

639
00:56:19,910 --> 00:56:22,060
这样情况会越来越糟糕的
It'll get worse than I been telling you.

640
00:56:22,350 --> 00:56:24,240
我也逮捕了你的父亲
I got your father under arrest.

641
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:26,200
没用的，吉诺！
It won't work, Gino!

642
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:28,600
天啊，你怎么就不懂呢？
God! Why don't you understand this?

643
00:56:30,150 --> 00:56:31,610
我们没法帮你
We can't help you.

644
00:56:31,890 --> 00:56:34,240
他要知道我们帮了你，他会连爸爸一起杀掉！
If he even thinks we did, he'll kill Pop too.

645
00:56:34,320 --> 00:56:35,350
他有那么离谱了？
He's that far gone?

646
00:56:35,530 --> 00:56:37,180
你还是相信吧，吉诺
Believe it, Gino.

647
00:56:37,980 --> 00:56:39,180
任何人
Anybody.

648
00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:42,950
这样的话，今晚我要把你留在这里好让你保命
Then I'm going to keep you here tonight and keep you alive.

649
00:56:43,220 --> 00:56:44,660
明天再恨我吧
Hate me tomorrow.

650
00:56:52,330 --> 00:56:53,820
在八〇区
In the 8-0 precinct.

651
00:56:54,100 --> 00:56:58,660
信号一〇一三，警员遭袭，安博伊大街，六八三五号
Signal 1013. Police officer shot. 6835 Amboy Street.

652
00:56:59,340 --> 00:57:03,280
今晚将是这个城市难以忘怀的一个晚上
This is one night this town ain't never going to forget about.

653
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:06,240
问问我，我想你已经万事具备了
Ask me, I think you already made sure of that.

654
00:57:06,510 --> 00:57:10,450
你的妻子打来几次电话，她和托尼一起在你的公寓里
Your wife's called couple times. She's at your apartment with Tony.

655
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:13,150
能不能抽空过来一下呢？
Any chance you can swing over there for a minute?

656
00:57:14,890 --> 00:57:17,050
不行，我正在巡逻
I could do that. I'm right in the area.

657
00:57:19,960 --> 00:57:22,550
来，过来
Come over here. Come here.

658
00:57:26,370 --> 00:57:29,630
我都差点忘了你了
I almost forgot about you.

659
00:57:30,370 --> 00:57:33,800
我得给你洗个热水澡，再弄点食物
I got to get you a nice hot bath, some food.

660
00:57:34,370 --> 00:57:36,890
也许再给你弄个女朋友吧
Maybe a girlfriend or something.

661
00:58:00,730 --> 00:58:01,490
托尼好吗？
How's Tony?

662
00:58:01,930 --> 00:58:02,690
他很好
He's fine.

663
00:58:05,660 --> 00:58:06,750
你吃饭了吗？
Did you eat?

664
00:58:07,230 --> 00:58:09,360
吃了几块狗饼干
A couple of dog biscuits.

665
00:58:09,630 --> 00:58:11,570
- 这是新来的狗  - 看看啊
- This is my new dog.  - Look at you.

666
00:58:13,070 --> 00:58:15,540
- 是警犬？ - 它叫寇利吉奥
- A police dog?  - This is Corragio.

667
00:58:16,670 --> 00:58:17,540
你要收留它吗？
Are you keeping him?

668
00:58:17,910 --> 00:58:19,430
我是这么想的
I'm thinking about it.

669
00:58:20,680 --> 00:58:23,270
也许吧，着取决于它有多勇敢
Maybe. It depends on how brave he is.

670
00:58:26,020 --> 00:58:27,710
我最好去回去看看托尼
I'd better go and see Tony.

671
00:58:32,420 --> 00:58:34,220
想上来吃点东西吗？
You want to come up for an espresso?

672
00:58:34,860 --> 00:58:36,950
好啊，为什么不呢？
Yeah. Why not?

673
00:58:38,030 --> 00:58:40,120
好好呆在那儿，乖孩子
You stay there and be a good boy.

674
00:58:43,870 --> 00:58:47,430
- 要把狗给托尼看看吗？ - 那他就睡不着觉了
- Should we show the dog to Tony?  - He'll never go back to sleep.

675
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:50,290
你小时候养过狗吗？
Did you ever have a dog when you were little?

676
00:58:51,370 --> 00:58:54,460
开玩笑，我们连自己都没办法吃饱
We didn't have enough money to feed ourselves.

677
00:58:54,810 --> 00:58:58,700
我们还小的时候，这个居民区里来了一个老人
There was this old man who came to the neighborhood when we were kids.

678
00:59:00,220 --> 00:59:02,140
他是从偏远的乡下来的
He was from the old country.

679
00:59:02,720 --> 00:59:04,800
他带着一个古老的铃铛
He carried an old school bell.

680
00:59:05,220 --> 00:59:09,710
他有一个脚踏的磨刀器
He pulled along a sharpening machine operated by a foot peddle.

681
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:16,150
邻居们就叫他把自家的刀和剪刀磨锋利
The neighbors used to get their knives and scissors sharpened.

682
00:59:16,460 --> 00:59:18,360
一角钱或者两角钱
A dime here, a quarter there.

683
00:59:19,060 --> 00:59:20,820
但这是种诚实的谋生方式
But it was an honest living.

684
00:59:21,390 --> 00:59:22,830
日子一天天地过去…
Time goes on...

685
00:59:23,130 --> 00:59:24,790
…人们逐渐开始买…
...people start buying...

686
00:59:25,060 --> 00:59:27,660
多功能的刀和剪刀了
...disposable scissors and knives.

687
00:59:28,470 --> 00:59:30,440
越来越少的人找他磨刀
Fewer and fewer people come out.

688
00:59:31,140 --> 00:59:32,730
我总是在想…
I always used to think to myself...

689
00:59:33,410 --> 00:59:35,370
…他这样地…
...how it would feel to leave...

690
00:59:35,640 --> 00:59:37,230
…早出晚归…
...before light...

691
00:59:37,910 --> 00:59:39,570
…又没什么收获给家人看…
...and come back after dark...

692
00:59:39,910 --> 00:59:44,080
…是一种什么感觉呢…
...with nothing to show your wife and family for what you've done.

693
00:59:47,090 --> 00:59:50,720
那铃声是我听到过的最孤独的声音
That bell was the loneliest sound I ever heard.

694
00:59:52,890 --> 00:59:54,620
那个老人就是你父亲吧？
He was your father, wasn't he?

695
00:59:57,430 --> 01:00:01,090
我记得我一度跟了他一个夏天…
I remember one time I followed the old man for a whole summer...

696
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:02,560
…每天…
...every day...

697
01:00:02,900 --> 01:00:04,360
…从日出到日落
...day in, day out.

698
01:00:06,770 --> 01:00:10,360
过了一段时间，这开始令他倍受煎熬
And after a while, it started to grind him down.

699
01:00:12,110 --> 01:00:14,700
没人，没人再需要他了，你知道吗？
Nobody, nobody needs him, you know?

700
01:00:15,780 --> 01:00:17,970
如果你觉得没人再需要你了…
If you feel like nobody needs you...

701
01:00:19,120 --> 01:00:20,870
…如果你觉得自己毫无用处了…
...and you feel useless...

702
01:00:25,390 --> 01:00:26,870
…你的心就死了
...you die inside.

703
01:00:30,620 --> 01:00:32,380
你就没了生存的欲望
You let yourself go.

704
01:00:33,890 --> 01:00:37,350
我们总是告诉别人：“爸爸死于癌症”
We always used to tell everybody, "Pop died from cancer. "

705
01:00:38,190 --> 01:00:40,190
可是我相信，他死于一颗破碎的心
I believe he died of a broken heart.

706
01:00:41,730 --> 01:00:43,220
爸爸死后…
After Pop died...

707
01:00:44,830 --> 01:00:48,270
附近的孩子想要去科尼岛玩…
...and the neighborhood kids wanted to go to Coney Island to play...

708
01:00:49,970 --> 01:00:52,640
…有那么一个父亲，马德诺先生…
...one of the other fathers, Mr. Madano...

709
01:00:52,910 --> 01:00:56,610
…会偷偷给我一点钱，让我可以和别的孩子一起玩
...used to slip me a little money so I could go play with the kids too.

710
01:01:04,350 --> 01:01:06,250
你知道我是怎么报答马德诺先生的吗？
You know how I repay Mr. Madano?

711
01:01:06,490 --> 01:01:08,820
你想知道今晚我是如何感激他的吗？
You want to know how I thanked him tonight?

712
01:01:09,930 --> 01:01:11,110
我逮捕了他
I arrested him.

713
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:13,930
这样我才能找到理查
Just so I could get to Richie.

714
01:01:15,770 --> 01:01:17,530
我就是那么个疯子
That's how crazy I get.

715
01:01:19,170 --> 01:01:23,060
吉诺，这里是你的管辖区域…
Gino, these may be your streets and your neighborhood...

716
01:01:24,540 --> 01:01:26,190
…但是还有别的警察啊
...but there are other police officers.

717
01:01:28,180 --> 01:01:29,930
我为你的所做而感到自豪
I'm really proud of what you do.

718
01:01:32,680 --> 01:01:34,770
我知道每个人都很爱你
And I know how everybody loves you.

719
01:01:35,950 --> 01:01:37,880
但托尼需要一个父亲…
But Tony needs a father...

720
01:01:38,860 --> 01:01:40,370
…我也需要一个丈夫
...and I need a husband.

721
01:01:43,360 --> 01:01:46,380
我们在这儿干什么？重叙旧好？
What are we talking, reconciliation over here?

722
01:01:46,960 --> 01:01:49,290
不，我们在谈人生
No, we're talking a lifetime deal.

723
01:01:50,120 --> 01:01:52,910
不论拥有一切抑或一无所有
All or nothing.

724
01:01:54,460 --> 01:01:55,620
我能做到
I could do that.

725
01:01:56,460 --> 01:01:57,790
我可以做到
That I could do.

726
01:02:11,210 --> 01:02:12,470
我爱你
I love you.

727
01:02:33,830 --> 01:02:36,420
- 托尼！托尼在哪儿？ - 躲到浴缸里
- Tony! We need Tony!  - Get down in the bathtub!

728
01:02:36,740 --> 01:02:37,850
好的，浴缸里
In the bathtub.

729
01:03:17,600 --> 01:03:18,760
你死定了
You're dead.

730
01:03:27,880 --> 01:03:29,670
来啊，你这个叛徒！
Come on, you rat bastard!

731
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:36,540
扔了它
Drop it!

732
01:03:38,220 --> 01:03:40,210
你想对一个手无寸铁的人开枪？
You going to shoot an unarmed man?

733
01:03:40,220 --> 01:03:43,160
当然不会，你知道我要做什么？
I wouldn't. You know what I'm going to do?

734
01:03:43,430 --> 01:03:45,090
你这个王八蛋！
You motherfucker!

735
01:03:56,910 --> 01:04:00,560
安琪儿，派几个人到我家来
Angie, send me units over to my apartment.

736
01:04:00,910 --> 01:04:04,090
我这里发生了枪击案
There's been a shooting over at my place.

737
01:04:04,410 --> 01:04:07,500
是一群理查的手下，他们已经被我打死了
It's a bunch of Richie Madano's crew. They're all deceased.

738
01:04:16,020 --> 01:04:18,680
我要送你和你妈妈去宾馆
Going to take you to a hotel with your mother.

739
01:04:21,850 --> 01:04:26,020
我知道这件事不好解决，你也很害怕
I know that this is not an easy thing and I know you're upset.

740
01:04:26,360 --> 01:04:28,260
我会把它解决的
I'll take care of it right away.

741
01:04:33,930 --> 01:04:34,700
哦，妈的！
Oh, shit!

742
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:38,370
伙计…
Fellas...

743
01:04:39,110 --> 01:04:40,040
…来杯饮料吧
...have a drink.

744
01:04:40,370 --> 01:04:41,430
不必了
Never mind that bullshit.

745
01:04:41,770 --> 01:04:42,900
你给我坐下
Sit down, dickhead.

746
01:04:44,010 --> 01:04:46,640
我们在找你的兄弟，他在哪儿？
We're looking for your brother. Where is he?

747
01:04:47,510 --> 01:04:49,310
他没来过，我没见过他
He ain't been around. I ain't seen him.

748
01:04:49,580 --> 01:04:51,020
你听得懂英语吗？
You understand English?

749
01:04:51,380 --> 01:04:52,980
教他点英文吧
Teach this guy some English.

750
01:04:53,290 --> 01:04:56,220
你这个小杂碎，快说！
You fucking bum. You want to give me the right answer?

751
01:04:56,390 --> 01:04:58,570
你兄弟在哪儿？
Where's your fucking brother? You cocksucker!

752
01:04:58,960 --> 01:05:00,890
不然我打烂你的头！
I'll break your fucking head!

753
01:05:01,230 --> 01:05:05,320
你们两个都死定了！你们两个！告诉他
You're both dead, you fucking bums! The two of you! Tell him that!

754
01:05:05,630 --> 01:05:09,330
就说拉斯特说你们死定了，你们两个人！
Say Rusty told you you're dead! The two of yous!

755
01:05:14,070 --> 01:05:15,390
王八蛋！
You asshole!

756
01:05:23,580 --> 01:05:25,670
你们都滚出去！
Get the fuck out of here!

757
01:05:27,240 --> 01:05:29,040
快从这里滚出去！
Get the fuck out of here, man!

758
01:05:31,490 --> 01:05:34,140
我打赌你在你那片很出名了
I bet you're real popular in your neighborhood now.

759
01:05:34,430 --> 01:05:37,580
安琪儿，我一向不怎么受欢迎
Angie, I was never too popular with my neighbors.

760
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:39,390
我要去拉莫尔了
I'm heading to Lamore's now.

761
01:05:57,840 --> 01:05:59,100
派蒂回来了吗？
Patti back yet?

762
01:05:59,780 --> 01:06:02,370
我可以和你私下里谈谈吗？
Can I talk to you in private for a minute, please?

763
01:06:06,780 --> 01:06:08,110
坐下
Sit over here.

764
01:06:14,520 --> 01:06:15,550
这个人是你？
Is this you?

765
01:06:16,530 --> 01:06:17,960
我叫泰利·马隆
My name's Terry Malloy.

766
01:06:18,290 --> 01:06:19,720
那洛葛仙妮是谁？
So who's Roxanne?

767
01:06:19,960 --> 01:06:22,510
理查的女朋友，我以为你们都在找她
Richie's girlfriend. I thought that's who you were looking for.

768
01:06:22,800 --> 01:06:25,500
的确，你知道我在哪儿能找到她吗？
It is. Do you know where I can find her?

769
01:06:25,970 --> 01:06:29,090
我只知道她住在布鲁克林，但不知道哪里
I think she lives here in Brooklyn, but I don't know where.

770
01:06:29,370 --> 01:06:32,960
不知道哪里，你是什么？一个关心大事的公民了？
You don't know where. What are you, a concerned citizen now?

771
01:06:33,310 --> 01:06:34,160
为什么不？
Why not?

772
01:06:34,440 --> 01:06:35,830
理查和你什么关系？
Who is Richie to you, anyway?

773
01:06:36,380 --> 01:06:37,800
他是一坨屎
A piece of shit.

774
01:06:39,080 --> 01:06:40,770
你怎么看上去像是刚哭过？
How come you look like you been crying?

775
01:06:42,640 --> 01:06:44,270
我有偏头痛
I got a fucking migraine.

776
01:06:47,060 --> 01:06:49,140
听着，我要问你点事
Listen, I want to ask you something.

777
01:06:50,160 --> 01:06:51,670
你认识这个女孩吗？
Do you know this girl?

778
01:06:56,990 --> 01:06:59,080
你先给我坐在这里
Maybe you could sit over here.

779
01:07:00,390 --> 01:07:01,490
你还好吗？
You all right?

780
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:04,530
拜托，泰利
Come on, Terry.

781
01:07:07,230 --> 01:07:08,670
你得告诉我
You have to talk to me.

782
01:07:12,410 --> 01:07:13,600
她到底是谁？
Who is it?

783
01:07:14,010 --> 01:07:15,670
她是洛葛仙妮
It's Roxanne.

784
01:07:17,740 --> 01:07:19,710
你跟鲍勃同时都和她上床？
And you were fucking Bobby at the same time?

785
01:07:20,180 --> 01:07:23,240
别这样，来，稳定一下情绪
Don't be that way. Come on. Settle down.

786
01:07:28,490 --> 01:07:29,550
你姓什么？
She got a last name?

787
01:07:30,190 --> 01:07:31,850
福特，我叫洛葛仙妮·福特
Ford. Roxanne Ford.

788
01:08:11,620 --> 01:08:13,210
你好吗，沃米尔？
How you doing, Vermeer?

789
01:08:15,290 --> 01:08:18,450
你是怎么来的？天啊！
How the hell did you get up here, man? Jesus Christ!

790
01:08:21,230 --> 01:08:22,990
他和这件事无关
He didn't have nothing to do with it.

791
01:08:34,910 --> 01:08:39,350
你去哪儿了？我们在这里等了你一个晚上
Where you been? We been waiting around here all night for you.

792
01:08:44,650 --> 01:08:46,480
你在等什么呢？
What you been waiting on?

793
01:08:48,320 --> 01:08:49,290
你在等什么？
What you been waiting on?

794
01:08:49,930 --> 01:08:51,710
看看你是否需要我们，想喝点什么？
Waiting on if you need us. What do you think?

795
01:08:51,990 --> 01:08:53,260
你的鼻子怎么了？
What happened to your nose?

796
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:59,390
吉诺仗着警察的身份，把场子砸了
Gino came around, playing the role. Busting up the place.

797
01:08:59,670 --> 01:09:01,180
什么？你们没有武器？
What, you ain't got a piece?

798
01:09:04,010 --> 01:09:05,860
吧台后面不是有枪吗？
You got a piece behind the bar.

799
01:09:06,280 --> 01:09:09,260
你就让他打了你的脸？你怎么不扁他？
You let him do that to your face? Why didn't you whack him?

800
01:09:09,550 --> 01:09:12,830
我只知道你杀了鲍勃，你叫我攻击一个警察？
All I heard was you clipped Bobby. You want me to whack a cop too?

801
01:09:14,110 --> 01:09:17,100
没人担心你被人打对吧？
Nobody has to worry about you stepping on your dick.

802
01:09:20,290 --> 01:09:24,440
你知道他有多厉害，而且你又把鲍勃杀了！
You know how wacko he gets! And with you doing Bobby like that!

803
01:09:25,180 --> 01:09:28,780
你们把我和一个小杂碎搞反了
You're mistaking me for someone who gives a shit.

804
01:09:30,020 --> 01:09:31,580
如果吉诺跟我对着干…
If Gino and me bang heads...

805
01:09:31,860 --> 01:09:33,760
…我就让他进棺材
...he'll be racked in a closed casket.

806
01:09:36,130 --> 01:09:37,920
你不会让他抓到你？
You won't let him take you?

807
01:09:39,530 --> 01:09:40,860
你是什么？小丑吗？
What are you, a clown?

808
01:09:42,870 --> 01:09:45,730
抓到我？把我抓去哪儿？
Take me? Take me where?

809
01:09:52,880 --> 01:09:55,180
你们叫一个混蛋弄成这样！
You let one motherfucker take you!

810
01:09:55,480 --> 01:10:00,080
不单单只有吉诺！还有别人满街地砸我们的门
It ain't just Gino! Bulls are banging down doors all over the neighborhood.

811
01:10:01,520 --> 01:10:03,110
是弗兰齐他们，他们回来了
It's Frankie's guys. They're back!

812
01:10:03,390 --> 01:10:07,920
除了他们，每几个小时就有一群不同的人进来打我
Them too! Every couple of hours a different bunch comes slapping me.

813
01:10:08,230 --> 01:10:10,700
别像个孬种一样地抱怨了，拿着你的枪
Stop whining like a cunt and get your piece.

814
01:10:17,070 --> 01:10:18,260
我不能这样做
I can't.

815
01:10:21,070 --> 01:10:22,930
别再让我看到你
Don't let me see you again.

816
01:10:24,840 --> 01:10:26,460
绝不要让我再见到你
Don't ever let me see you again.

817
01:10:34,880 --> 01:10:37,540
晚上好，伙计，很高兴见到你啊
Good evening, fellas. Nice to see you again.

818
01:10:38,760 --> 01:10:41,240
废话少说，他在哪里？
Never mind the bullshit. Where the fuck is he?

819
01:10:41,850 --> 01:10:42,720
就在这儿，萨尔
Over here, Sal.

820
01:10:59,400 --> 01:11:00,660
你失败了
You lose.

821
01:12:25,380 --> 01:12:26,570
她是谁？
Who's she?

822
01:12:28,210 --> 01:12:29,650
她带我找到了他的女朋友
She brought me to the girlfriend.

823
01:12:29,880 --> 01:12:33,980
她得确认一下尸体，所以她有点害怕
She just had to identify the body, so she's a little upset.

824
01:12:34,950 --> 01:12:37,480
- 你今早吃早饭了吗？ - 当然
- Did you have breakfast this morning?  - Of course

825
01:12:38,460 --> 01:12:40,480
很好，场面不会很好看的
Good. Because it ain't pretty.

826
01:12:51,770 --> 01:12:52,520
怎么了？
What is it?

827
01:12:52,970 --> 01:12:55,490
他杀了艾利和另外三个人
He killed Allie and 3 of the other guys.

828
01:12:56,740 --> 01:12:58,220
事情很不妙
This is no good.

829
01:12:58,810 --> 01:13:00,230
我们去把理查找出来
Let's go find Richie.

830
01:13:03,080 --> 01:13:06,740
澳·凯利，上楼叫人拍照取证
O'IKelly, get upstairs and make them photograph that thing right.

831
01:13:13,580 --> 01:13:16,550
这是我在鲍勃的书桌里发现的
This is what I found in Bobby's desk.

832
01:13:17,650 --> 01:13:21,680
鲍勃同时跟这个和车里的那个上床
Bobby was doing this one and the one in the car at the same time.

833
01:13:22,420 --> 01:13:26,420
从尸体的状态来看，我推断…
Now, from the extreme rigor mortis in the body, it looks like...

834
01:13:26,830 --> 01:13:30,240
死亡时间是二十四小时以前，在鲍勃之前
...time of death, 24 hours ago. Before Bobby.

835
01:13:32,430 --> 01:13:34,490
我受够了这个案子了
I'm getting too old for this shit.

836
01:13:34,770 --> 01:13:36,260
我知道你的意思
I know what you mean.

837
01:14:03,130 --> 01:14:05,390
嘿，小声点，我妹妹在睡觉
Hey, keep it down. My sister's sleeping.

838
01:14:05,700 --> 01:14:09,460
把她叫醒我们就不会打扰到你们了，对吧？
Wake her up. We ain't disturbing yous, are we?

839
01:14:10,210 --> 01:14:11,790
里卡，过来
Rica, come here.

840
01:14:12,370 --> 01:14:14,130
我们要开一个小派对
We're wanting a little party.

841
01:14:16,650 --> 01:14:18,230
一个小派对
I want a little party.

842
01:14:18,650 --> 01:14:21,130
是我的离别派对，对吧，鲍勃？
It's kind of my going- away party. Right, Bobby?

843
01:14:21,450 --> 01:14:22,740
没错，理查
Right, Rich.

844
01:14:23,010 --> 01:14:25,240
你没什么意见吧？
You ain't got a problem with that, do you?

845
01:14:25,890 --> 01:14:27,240
没有，理查，没问题
No, Rich. No problem.

846
01:14:37,220 --> 01:14:39,210
安琪儿？帮我接通吉诺，我是皮克利诺
Angie? Get me Gino. It's Picolino.

847
01:14:39,560 --> 01:14:43,490
给一个叫威利的拉皮条的打电话，叫他把最好的女人带来
Call up Willy the Pimp. You tell him to send over his best broads.

848
01:14:43,760 --> 01:14:46,750
这样就没人会说你是为了钱才和我混的
Nobody will say you hung out with me just for the money.

849
01:14:53,470 --> 01:14:55,100
理查，拜托，不要这样
Richie, please, come on.

850
01:14:58,410 --> 01:15:00,440
我来伺候你，理查
I'll take care of you, Rich.

851
01:15:00,750 --> 01:15:02,340
我来伺候你，理查
I'll take care of you, Rich.

852
01:15:04,850 --> 01:15:05,820
嘿，大伙！
Hey, boys!

853
01:15:06,920 --> 01:15:09,180
我们今晚有福享了
We're going to have us a real good time tonight.

854
01:15:09,920 --> 01:15:12,180
大日子啊，理查，大日子
Big time, Richie. Big time.

855
01:15:12,590 --> 01:15:15,520
这是我的晚上，我的最后一晚
It's my night! My last night!

856
01:15:21,200 --> 01:15:24,080
- 谁？ - 吉诺
- Who is it?  - Gino.

857
01:15:32,610 --> 01:15:33,590
你还好吗，劳拉
How you doing, Laura?

858
01:15:33,880 --> 01:15:36,900
很好，维克走了以后我睡不着觉
Good. Okay. I couldn't sleep after Vick left.

859
01:15:36,950 --> 01:15:39,760
所以我洗了个澡，现在好多了
So I had a bath. I'm better now.

860
01:15:50,220 --> 01:15:51,810
你在干什么？
What are you doing?

861
01:15:52,220 --> 01:15:53,880
你在找什么？
What are you looking for?

862
01:15:55,290 --> 01:15:57,660
不，不，吉诺，那是我的钱包
No. No, Gino, that's my purse.

863
01:15:57,960 --> 01:15:59,890
快还给我，吉诺，快停下！
Give me... Gino, stop!

864
01:16:06,870 --> 01:16:07,830
这是什么？
What's this?

865
01:16:10,140 --> 01:16:11,600
这是什么？
What is this?

866
01:16:11,740 --> 01:16:14,570
这是不是理查杀了鲍勃以后扔下的东西？
Is this what Richie threw on Bobby after he shot him?

867
01:16:15,810 --> 01:16:17,210
思维真快啊
That was fast thinking.

868
01:16:17,750 --> 01:16:20,070
不愧是个警察的妻子
Just like a good cop's wife would.

869
01:16:22,080 --> 01:16:23,350
你知道我是怎么想的吗？
You know what I think?

870
01:16:23,650 --> 01:16:25,750
我认为你一发现这个东西…
I think you found one of these somewhere.

871
01:16:26,020 --> 01:16:28,210
…你就光火得很，不敢正眼看它
And got so fucking mad you couldn't see straight.

872
01:16:28,660 --> 01:16:33,420
所以你寄了一张给理查，却做梦也没想到他会杀了鲍勃
So you sent one to Richie, never dreaming he might actually kill Bobby.

873
01:16:35,830 --> 01:16:38,350
我拿走照片是因为我想保护他
I only took it because I wanted to protect him.

874
01:16:39,670 --> 01:16:41,920
看看，这就是洛葛仙妮
See, this is Roxanne, here.

875
01:16:42,570 --> 01:16:46,360
才二十四岁，理查先杀了她
Twenty-four years old. Richie killed her first.

876
01:16:46,680 --> 01:16:48,600
你错了，吉诺
You got it all wrong, Gino.

877
01:16:49,180 --> 01:16:52,000
我把它拿走只是不想让人知道
I only took it so people wouldn't know.

878
01:16:52,450 --> 01:16:53,700
鲍勃很肮脏，对吧？
Bobby was dirty, wasn't he?

879
01:16:54,670 --> 01:16:56,110
也许…
Or maybe...

880
01:16:56,390 --> 01:16:59,640
…他碰巧也在和理查的女人上床
...he was just doing Richie's girlfriend at the same time.

881
01:16:59,910 --> 01:17:01,210
我不那么认为
I don't think so.

882
01:17:02,180 --> 01:17:05,450
我认为鲍勃一直想学另一个人
I think that Bobby always wanted to be like somebody else.

883
01:17:06,320 --> 01:17:10,780
他喜欢理查的生活方式，他的钱，他的女人，你知道他是个肮脏的人
He liked Richie's lifestyle, his money, his women. You knew he was dirty.

884
01:17:10,990 --> 01:17:13,390
鲍勃已经走了，其他人也都走了
Bobby's gone now. So are lots of other people.

885
01:17:13,730 --> 01:17:15,720
我不想杀他
I didn't want to kill him.

886
01:17:15,990 --> 01:17:18,550
我只是想拯救我的婚姻
I just wanted to save my marriage.

887
01:17:19,130 --> 01:17:20,560
过来，劳丽，过来
Come here, Laurie.

888
01:17:22,700 --> 01:17:25,190
我要我的鲍勃回来
I want my Bobby back.

889
01:17:25,740 --> 01:17:27,330
我要他回来
I want him back.

890
01:17:32,810 --> 01:17:35,510
皮克利诺有急事找你
You have an emergency phone call from Picolino.

891
01:17:35,880 --> 01:17:37,610
安琪儿，帮我转接
Angie, patch me through right now.

892
01:17:39,300 --> 01:17:43,890
一个和理查有过来往的妓女就住在我格里高利叔叔的隔壁

893
01:17:44,090 --> 01:17:46,090
我想理查正在亲热呢

894
01:17:46,430 --> 01:17:49,360
听着，皮克利诺，我知道那个地方
Listen to me, Picolino. I know that place.

895
01:17:50,030 --> 01:17:52,000
马上离开那里，立刻！
Get out of the neighborhood now.

896
01:17:52,400 --> 01:17:54,400
我这就走

897
01:20:59,870 --> 01:21:01,370
把手放在桌子上！
Hands on the table!

898
01:21:01,670 --> 01:21:02,860
怎么回事？
What the fuck's going on?

899
01:21:19,690 --> 01:21:21,300
我兄弟吉诺来了
My buddy Gino's here.

900
01:21:24,390 --> 01:21:25,920
我要去和他玩玩了
I got to go play.

901
01:22:17,340 --> 01:22:18,380
去你的，臭警察！
Fuck you, cop!

902
01:22:32,120 --> 01:22:33,040
他在浴室里
He's in the bathroom!

903
01:22:49,090 --> 01:22:50,390
你想怎么做，啊？
What're you going to do?

904
01:22:51,290 --> 01:22:53,950
你想怎么做？逮捕我吗？
What're you going to do, you going to arrest me?

905
01:22:54,230 --> 01:22:55,820
我没子弹了！
I'm out of bullets!

906
01:22:59,970 --> 01:23:01,400
真是遗憾
That's a shame.

907
01:23:01,670 --> 01:23:04,400
那些子弹原本可以帮你省去许多痛苦的
Those bullets could've saved you a lot of pain.

908
01:23:04,740 --> 01:23:06,330
我就喜欢痛苦
I like pain, you know.

909
01:24:54,310 --> 01:24:55,760
我要杀了你
I'll kill you.

910
01:25:04,120 --> 01:25:05,470
这是替鲍勃还的
That's for Bobby.

911
01:25:09,110 --> 01:25:11,540
- 吉诺，发生了什么？ - 我中弹了，这里中了一弹
- What happened?  - I'm hit. Took one right here.

912
01:25:13,090 --> 01:25:14,640
你拿我的枪干什么？
What're you doing with my gun?!

913
01:25:17,090 --> 01:25:19,080
你怎么了？天啊！
What the hell is wrong with you? Jesus Christ!

914
01:25:19,390 --> 01:25:21,820
- 你做的是对的  - 我做的是对的？
- You did the right thing.  - I did the right thing?

915
01:25:25,030 --> 01:25:27,290
很抱歉事情不得不这样收场
I'm sorry it had to be this way.

916
01:25:27,630 --> 01:25:30,150
告诉老大你做的事，然后搞个仪式
Tell the boss what you did. Do the ritual thing.

917
01:25:30,430 --> 01:25:31,520
你有病吗？
Are you sick?

918
01:25:32,700 --> 01:25:35,170
把他扔到杰西的箱子里算了
Geez, put him in a fucking trunk in Jersey.

919
01:25:36,700 --> 01:25:38,540
听上去很不错，但是…
That sounds great, but...

920
01:25:38,810 --> 01:25:42,210
…我们能到城里吃顿饭吗？就我和你
...can we have dinner in the city, me and you alone sometime?

921
01:25:42,880 --> 01:25:45,040
当然，我连寻呼机都不会带的
Sure, I won't even bring my beeper.

922
01:25:45,810 --> 01:25:48,150
说起吃的，我想要吃…
Speaking of food, I could go for...
