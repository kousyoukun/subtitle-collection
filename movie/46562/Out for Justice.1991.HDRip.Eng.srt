1
00:01:01,639 --> 00:01:02,469
What's up?

2
00:01:03,515 --> 00:01:04,345
Nothing.

3
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:06,474
You don't work for me no more?

4
00:01:06,852 --> 00:01:10,221
Yeah. Didn't I just say I was
going to get his money?

5
00:01:10,731 --> 00:01:13,222
Bitch, I don't work for
the phone company.

6
00:01:13,484 --> 00:01:17,481
I don't do this shit Iong distance.
Bring your ass here.

7
00:01:28,165 --> 00:01:32,578
Do I Iook Iike I just feII off

00:01:33,712 --> 00:01:38,670
You know, Bobby, you been acting kind
of strange IateIy. You aII right?

9
00:01:40,135 --> 00:01:43,136
Just a few personaI probIems.
It's taken care of.

10
00:01:43,389 --> 00:01:45,049
What kind of probIems?

11
00:01:45,307 --> 00:01:46,885
I'II straighten it out.

12
00:01:47,142 --> 00:01:48,553
You sure?

13
00:01:48,811 --> 00:01:51,598
AbsoIuteIy.
Don't worry about it, okay?

14
00:01:57,194 --> 00:01:59,981
What's he doing?
He's beating this girI.

15
00:02:01,865 --> 00:02:05,199
We got a $3 miIIion hit
about to go down over here.

16
00:02:05,452 --> 00:02:07,659
You don't Iike it, turn your head.

17
00:02:09,456 --> 00:02:10,785
Come on, Gino.

18
00:02:15,045 --> 00:02:16,623
Guys, we're coming in.

19
00:02:17,172 --> 00:02:18,583
Gino's bIowing it.
Let's go.

20
00:02:25,931 --> 00:02:27,212
I'm pregnant!

21
00:02:27,558 --> 00:02:31,009
You pregnant? You Iet some trick
get you pregnant?

22
00:02:31,895 --> 00:02:34,517
Ain't you ever heard of a rubber?

23
00:02:45,993 --> 00:02:49,243
This motherfucker hit me.
I'm scared I'II Iose my baby.

24
00:02:49,538 --> 00:02:51,080
You wop motherfucker!

25
00:02:58,797 --> 00:03:00,457

27
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,259
Who the fuck you think you are?

28
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:05,794
You Iike to beat up on fucking women?

29
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:07,509
Beat up on me.

30
00:03:07,806 --> 00:03:09,799
Yeah, that's right.
You're bad.

31
00:03:10,017 --> 00:03:14,062
I know where you Iive, motherfucker.
I'II fuck your wife and kids--

32
00:03:23,614 --> 00:03:25,820
Gino, you son of a bitch!

33
00:03:58,899 --> 00:04:01,936
I got some unfinished business
to take care of.

34
00:04:02,194 --> 00:04:04,436
It'II be over by the end of tonight.

35
00:04:04,822 --> 00:04:06,898
Stick by me,
aII that money's yours.

36
00:04:08,867 --> 00:04:10,066
That's a Iot of money.

37
00:04:10,619 --> 00:04:13,406
We stuck with you through
worse for free.

38
00:04:14,415 --> 00:04:16,324
How Iong couId the night be?

39
00:04:37,438 --> 00:04:39,726
Mommy, can I get a hot dog?

40
00:04:40,608 --> 00:04:43,229
No, honey.
Forget about it, okay?

41
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,075
If you eat a hot dog now,
you'II ruin your dinner.

42
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:54,660
AIso, do me a favor.
Keep your sneakers cIean tonight.

43
00:04:54,955 --> 00:04:57,826
No dirt, no puddIes.
We got a party tonight.

44
00:05:06,258 --> 00:05:09,627
Let's go in here to get some stuff.
Bobby, I'II take the kids.

45
00:05:34,495 --> 00:05:35,775
How's that feeI, Bobby?

46
00:05:36,705 --> 00:05:38,283
You ain't Iaughing now.

47
00:06:10,698 --> 00:06:11,896
How you doing?

48
00:06:12,157 --> 00:06:14,827
Good.
Dad, can we pIay catch or what?

49
00:06:15,411 --> 00:06:16,905
You finish your homework?

50
00:06:17,288 --> 00:06:20,205
No? And you stiII want
to pIay catch with me?

51
00:06:21,959 --> 00:06:23,204
Go get your stuff.

52
00:06:23,419 --> 00:06:24,450
Thank you.

53
00:06:29,341 --> 00:06:31,215
Stop the car.
Give me the pipe.

54
00:06:31,468 --> 00:06:33,591
Doing a cop right in the street!

55
00:06:33,846 --> 00:06:36,800
-Give me the pipe, and make it hot!
-It's aIready hot!

56
00:06:41,854 --> 00:06:43,396
I got news for you.

57
00:06:43,689 --> 00:06:47,272
It'II get a Iot hotter
before the fucking night's over.

58
00:06:50,404 --> 00:06:52,064
Move the goddamn car!

59
00:06:53,449 --> 00:06:55,691
What are you doing?
Get in the car!

60
00:06:55,951 --> 00:06:57,445
What's the matter with you?

61
00:06:57,703 --> 00:06:58,533
He'II do her.

62
00:06:58,746 --> 00:06:59,991
-AsshoIe.
-AsshoIe?

63
00:07:10,758 --> 00:07:12,549
What are you Iooking at?

64
00:07:19,642 --> 00:07:22,477
You got the mitt. I got the baII.
Get the bat.

65
00:07:22,728 --> 00:07:25,266
Let's go. Let's go.

66
00:07:41,997 --> 00:07:43,242
-Gino?
-Yeah.

67
00:07:43,499 --> 00:07:47,034
-Can you get down to the precinct?
-I'm with the kid. Why?

68
00:07:47,294 --> 00:07:52,003
Bobby Lupo was shot on 1 8th Avenue
in front of his wife and kids.

69
00:07:52,257 --> 00:07:53,835
Oh, my God!

70
00:07:55,052 --> 00:07:56,546
I'm sending you a car.

71
00:08:09,024 --> 00:08:11,942
Vick, I gotta send Tony over right now.

72
00:08:12,278 --> 00:08:17,105
Damn you and the department! He waits
a month for one weekend with you.

73
00:08:17,366 --> 00:08:19,489
I know, but Bobby just got shot.

74
00:08:19,952 --> 00:08:21,494
Oh, my God!

75
00:08:21,787 --> 00:08:25,073
Laurie and the kids were with him
over on 1 8th Avenue.

76
00:08:25,541 --> 00:08:28,957
I'II be right over.
Send Tony to my parents' house.

77
00:08:29,253 --> 00:08:31,495
I'll pick him up afterwards.

78
00:08:49,315 --> 00:08:52,648
Get them out of here, Vick.
PIease, get them out of here.

79
00:08:57,406 --> 00:08:59,315
You sure you want to see this?

80
00:09:03,787 --> 00:09:06,243
Give him some room, wiII you?
Come on!

81
00:09:06,999 --> 00:09:10,119
Check with peopIe.
See if there are any witnesses.

82
00:09:10,336 --> 00:09:12,459
AII I got is this
fruit-and-vegetabIe guy.

83
00:09:24,683 --> 00:09:27,886
I'm reaI sorry, Gino.
It was Richie Madano.

84
00:09:28,604 --> 00:09:32,815
Laurie said Richie got out of the car
and just stepped up. Bang!

85
00:09:33,108 --> 00:09:37,770
The grocer said he tossed something,
Iike a card. We didn't find nothing.

86
00:09:38,697 --> 00:09:43,443
We know every Mob operation.
We'II squeeze them to give him up.

87
00:09:44,036 --> 00:09:48,912
You do that. But it's me who'II
find this fucking guy. You know that.

88
00:09:49,917 --> 00:09:50,699
You and Vicky--

89
00:09:50,876 --> 00:09:54,162
Forget about it.
The divorce goes through this month.

90
00:09:55,506 --> 00:09:56,786
How'd it happen?

91
00:09:57,132 --> 00:10:00,050
Some wannabe wiseguy asshoIe,
Richie Madano.

92
00:10:01,053 --> 00:10:02,713
Dope deaIer, dope user. . . .

93
00:10:02,972 --> 00:10:05,463
He's a guy Bobby
and Gino grew up with.

94
00:10:05,724 --> 00:10:07,883
We don't know why he'd kiII Bobby.

95
00:10:08,936 --> 00:10:09,766
Captain.

96
00:10:10,813 --> 00:10:12,188
Wait a second.

97
00:10:16,652 --> 00:10:20,317
-Are you aII right?
-No, I'm not! He was my best friend.

98
00:10:23,867 --> 00:10:25,825
He just puIIed a woman
out of a car. . .

99
00:10:26,036 --> 00:10:28,325
. . .and bIew her brains out.
It Iooks random.

100
00:10:28,622 --> 00:10:31,742
Three of his crew were with him.
One has a tattoo on his neck.

101
00:10:32,001 --> 00:10:33,874
I know him. That's Bochi.

102
00:10:34,128 --> 00:10:37,544
He's a piece of shit.
He's got a sheet as Iong as my arm.

103
00:10:37,798 --> 00:10:40,123
We got a city-wide out,
every officer.

104
00:10:40,384 --> 00:10:43,053
We got A.L.'s at the airports,
trains, buses--

105
00:10:43,262 --> 00:10:44,839
This guy won't run.

106
00:10:45,097 --> 00:10:48,762
He'II sneak and hide,
but he won't Ieave BrookIyn.

107
00:10:49,893 --> 00:10:53,013
I'II feed you every
dope-digging dive he's got.

108
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:55,638
Just give me an unmarked
and a shotgun.

109
00:11:04,366 --> 00:11:07,153
Gino, you're too cIose.
Let other cops do it.

110
00:11:07,411 --> 00:11:10,246
I know this guy
better than anybody eIse.

111
00:11:10,456 --> 00:11:14,156
I know the neighborhood
better than the other cops do.

112
00:11:22,843 --> 00:11:25,299
-Be carefuI, wiII you?
-You know me.

113
00:11:26,388 --> 00:11:29,555
-Get the son of a bitch.
-I'II do what I can.

114
00:11:32,061 --> 00:11:33,804
Why won't this man run?

115
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:37,640
You never understood nothing
about the neighborhood.

116
00:11:37,858 --> 00:11:39,139
No, I guess not.

117
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:43,488
You kiII a cop on 1 8th Avenue in front
of witnesses, you're gonna die.

118
00:11:43,739 --> 00:11:47,190
The difference is, this guy wants
to die in his own neighborhood.

119
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:51,030
Why can't you aII piss on a tree
to mark your territory?

120
00:11:51,664 --> 00:11:56,575
Don't worry. I'II be at the divorce
hearing on time, in one piece.

121
00:11:58,379 --> 00:12:02,211
I'II pick up Laurie and the girIs
and bring them to our house.

122
00:12:02,466 --> 00:12:04,838
Get it over with
so we can finish this.

123
00:12:41,714 --> 00:12:46,459
Find Richie Madano before the cops do,
and bring him to me here!

124
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,055
What about Gino?

125
00:12:51,307 --> 00:12:53,383
Stay away from Gino.
Leave him aIone.

126
00:12:53,934 --> 00:12:55,215
Come on, go!

127
00:13:27,551 --> 00:13:28,832
Sammy, how are you?

128
00:13:29,053 --> 00:13:30,428
What are you doing here?

129
00:13:32,723 --> 00:13:34,550
You stiII comb your hair
Iike a girI.

130
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:38,764
-How are you?
-Good.

131
00:13:38,979 --> 00:13:40,438
Everything aII right?

132
00:13:46,779 --> 00:13:49,151
Gino, I'm sorry what happened.

133
00:14:05,756 --> 00:14:09,042
My sincere regrets.
Comes from my heart.

134
00:14:17,184 --> 00:14:19,177
In front of a man's famiIy.

135
00:14:19,728 --> 00:14:21,721
It's inhuman.
Worse than that.

136
00:14:29,113 --> 00:14:29,943
He's not with us.

137
00:14:32,199 --> 00:14:35,864
You know we never Iet nobody
do anything Iike this.

138
00:14:36,328 --> 00:14:39,033
If you or one of your peopIe. . .

139
00:14:39,623 --> 00:14:40,999
. . .catch this guy. . .

140
00:14:41,208 --> 00:14:43,829
. . .he gets what?
Seven to ten, maybe.

141
00:14:44,086 --> 00:14:45,331
If we're Iucky.

142
00:14:45,921 --> 00:14:49,171
Gino, this man disgraced me. And you.

143
00:14:49,508 --> 00:14:52,877
He spiIIed an innocent man's bIood
in front of his famiIy!

144
00:14:53,178 --> 00:14:55,088
And on my sidewaIk!

145
00:14:56,849 --> 00:14:58,592
Gino, you know our ways.

146
00:14:59,018 --> 00:15:01,176
He must be deaIt with by us.

147
00:15:01,812 --> 00:15:03,223
But I promise you. . .

148
00:15:04,189 --> 00:15:07,190
. . .I wiII teach this man the price
of our bIood.

149
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:16,156
. . .God forbid I find him
before you do. . .

150
00:15:16,744 --> 00:15:17,906
. . .you know what I'II do.

151
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:26,085
Think about it.

152
00:15:36,013 --> 00:15:37,341
AII right, Gino?

153
00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:43,518
Patch me through to Doz.

154
00:15:43,729 --> 00:15:45,057
1 0-4. Switching over.

155
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:48,598
-Go ahead, taIk to me.
-Ronny, listen.

156
00:15:48,984 --> 00:15:52,899
Vittorio doesn't know nothing.
If he does, he won't teII me.

157
00:15:53,614 --> 00:15:58,442
I'm sending over O'KeIIy and some guys
from the OCCB. Keep in touch.

158
00:15:59,078 --> 00:16:01,782
-I'II keep you posted.
-Watch your ass.

159
00:16:03,457 --> 00:16:06,244
''KiII 'em aII. Let God sort them out. ''
Tough guy.

160
00:16:22,643 --> 00:16:23,841
PIease, God. . .

161
00:16:24,061 --> 00:16:26,552
. . .Iet me run into this guy someday.

162
00:18:00,574 --> 00:18:03,611
I heard what happened.
Hope you get the son of a bitch.

163
00:18:03,827 --> 00:18:06,864
Me too. Give me a six-pack
of seItzer, wiII you?

164
00:18:10,834 --> 00:18:12,661
Six dead Washingtons, brother.

165
00:18:18,509 --> 00:18:20,169
I never thought about it.

166
00:18:22,596 --> 00:18:24,340
We're gonna caII him Coraggio.

167
00:18:26,517 --> 00:18:28,842
You see anything, you drop a dime.

168
00:18:29,311 --> 00:18:30,556
How's your mother?

169
00:18:31,105 --> 00:18:33,014
She's going straight now.

170
00:18:34,275 --> 00:18:35,520
Thank God.

171
00:18:46,954 --> 00:18:48,329
You wanna fuck?

172
00:18:52,334 --> 00:18:54,742
Oh, my God.
Did you hear what she said?

173
00:18:55,004 --> 00:18:57,839
What'd she say, my man?
What'd she say?

174
00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:02,718
I'm at Sunset Park and 3rd.
Richie's cIients are aII down here.

175
00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:04,250
Ain 't it the truth.

176
00:19:10,686 --> 00:19:15,514
I'm Iooking for two hotshots for backup!
Anybody got the baIIs?

177
00:19:16,191 --> 00:19:17,769
Anybody got the baIIs?

178
00:19:18,027 --> 00:19:20,482
How about you?
You got the fucking baIIs?

179
00:19:20,738 --> 00:19:21,936
I got the baIIs.

180
00:19:22,197 --> 00:19:23,277
Now you got the bread.

181
00:19:23,657 --> 00:19:24,938
It's Gino!

182
00:19:25,367 --> 00:19:27,194
Get in the fucking car!

183
00:19:30,372 --> 00:19:31,701
Back up!

184
00:19:32,458 --> 00:19:33,407
Go!

185
00:19:34,627 --> 00:19:36,619
Get the fuck out of the way!

186
00:20:32,977 --> 00:20:33,890
Make a right!

187
00:20:34,144 --> 00:20:38,012
I'm trying to Iose him!
Too much weight in the car!

188
00:20:43,988 --> 00:20:47,937
If you don't Iose this cocksucker,
I'm going to pop you first.

189
00:20:48,158 --> 00:20:49,238
This guy's good.

190
00:20:51,161 --> 00:20:52,704
Having fun yet, guys?

191
00:20:59,837 --> 00:21:01,082
Lose this fucking guy!

192
00:21:01,338 --> 00:21:03,497
You want to drive this fucking car?

193
00:21:03,757 --> 00:21:05,999
Shut the fuck up, you hear me?

194
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:07,837
Shut the fuck up!

195
00:21:09,096 --> 00:21:10,009
I'II get him.

196
00:21:17,021 --> 00:21:18,431
This is where we Iose him.

197
00:21:20,024 --> 00:21:21,399
This is our break!

198
00:21:22,651 --> 00:21:23,814
Hang on!

199
00:21:25,070 --> 00:21:26,233
HoIy shit!

200
00:21:31,285 --> 00:21:32,909
Get out of the way!

201
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:48,291
We haven't Iost him yet.
Let's take him for some pork chops.

202
00:22:01,315 --> 00:22:02,346
Back up!

203
00:22:03,817 --> 00:22:05,940
Give me the merch and the buIIets.

204
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:09,608
-Do what he fucking says.
-Let's get out of here.

205
00:22:11,825 --> 00:22:13,485
AII right, here he is.

206
00:22:13,702 --> 00:22:17,154
I want you to hang this motherfucker
on a hook, you hear me?

207
00:22:17,373 --> 00:22:20,124
I got some scores to settIe.
You three come with me.

208
00:22:20,626 --> 00:22:22,037
Let's go!

209
00:22:23,796 --> 00:22:25,254
Hang him up by a hook!

210
00:22:46,402 --> 00:22:47,777
They'II cut him a new ass!

211
00:22:57,329 --> 00:22:58,705
Come get some!

212
00:23:04,086 --> 00:23:05,249
Bust his head!

213
00:23:12,970 --> 00:23:17,299
Richie's a bad guy. My friends don't
Iike him, and yours don't either.

214
00:23:17,558 --> 00:23:19,266
You hang with the wrong peopIe.

215
00:23:21,186 --> 00:23:22,384
Shit.

216
00:23:22,938 --> 00:23:24,598
This is for you, motherfucker!

217
00:23:24,982 --> 00:23:26,560
Don't be a bad guy.

218
00:23:27,151 --> 00:23:28,775
What you want to shoot me for?

219
00:23:29,737 --> 00:23:31,147
Don't be a bad guy.

220
00:23:31,447 --> 00:23:33,320
Be a nice guy, aII right?

221
00:23:38,162 --> 00:23:40,320
-Have you seen the news?
-Why?

222
00:23:40,581 --> 00:23:43,535
This fucking jerk Madano
was on the news again.

223
00:23:45,002 --> 00:23:46,995
Made him out to be a wiseguy.

224
00:23:47,921 --> 00:23:50,922
And they connected him to us.

225
00:23:52,134 --> 00:23:56,346
That piece of shit couIdn't be
a gangster if he owned New York City.

226
00:23:57,806 --> 00:23:59,182
Get him.

227
00:24:00,392 --> 00:24:02,764
We can't stand this pubIicity.

228
00:24:06,690 --> 00:24:08,184
I'II get him.

229
00:24:21,914 --> 00:24:23,741
You got any puppy dog food?

230
00:24:23,958 --> 00:24:26,034
Right here.
I got anything you want.

231
00:24:26,251 --> 00:24:28,161
I got this stuff here.

232
00:24:29,922 --> 00:24:33,457
That's good.
Looks Iike he needs some of this.

233
00:24:33,676 --> 00:24:37,625
None of this is from Jersey?
I don't want no radioactive stuff.

234
00:24:37,972 --> 00:24:39,430
I don't bIame you.

235
00:25:01,078 --> 00:25:02,952
What are you doing down here?

236
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,624
How you doing?

237
00:25:07,876 --> 00:25:09,335
It's okay.

238
00:25:09,628 --> 00:25:12,665
-I heard you got your Iicense.
-What'd I get, a dog Iicense?

239
00:25:13,048 --> 00:25:15,124
I heard you just got your button.

240
00:25:16,969 --> 00:25:18,760
You're stiII the dirtbag criminaI.

241
00:25:18,971 --> 00:25:22,969
You know how many cops
make my guys Iook Iike aItar boys?

242
00:25:23,892 --> 00:25:25,552
Ain't it the truth.

243
00:25:25,978 --> 00:25:27,638
Sad worId we Iive in.

244
00:25:27,896 --> 00:25:30,850
Hey, Lucky, it's our worId.
It's our system--

245
00:25:31,108 --> 00:25:34,691
-What, I gotta hear this again?
-Come on, we gotta do this.

246
00:25:37,656 --> 00:25:39,613
Ever since we was IittIe. . .

247
00:25:39,867 --> 00:25:42,274
. . .I never, ever tried to, you know. . .

248
00:25:42,494 --> 00:25:45,780
. . .act Iike I was better than you
at anything. And I never was.

249
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:49,788
You caIIed me Iucky. I wasn't Iucky.
It was just deep desire.

250
00:25:50,044 --> 00:25:53,460
I was aIways wiIIing to do
whatever it took to get the job done.

251
00:25:53,672 --> 00:25:55,131
You know, this thing. . . .

252
00:25:55,841 --> 00:26:00,752
You think it's the department. I don't
give a fuck about the department.

253
00:26:01,597 --> 00:26:03,755
This, to me, is personaI.

254
00:26:06,894 --> 00:26:08,471
You'II never change.

255
00:26:17,196 --> 00:26:18,904
Come on, Iet's get out of here.

256
00:26:36,298 --> 00:26:38,172
Oh, fuck me!

257
00:26:39,009 --> 00:26:40,420
Where is he?

258
00:26:40,636 --> 00:26:43,637
-I don't know.
-You haven't seen or heard from him?

259
00:26:43,847 --> 00:26:46,884
Come on, he's my brother.
I'II see him sooner or Iater.

260
00:26:47,101 --> 00:26:49,473
He's out of his mind,
sniffing that crap.

261
00:26:49,728 --> 00:26:54,307
I knew this wouId happen.
I'II caII you, on my mother's eyes.

262
00:26:54,858 --> 00:26:59,567
Find him. Otherwise, next time we
come here, you're coming with us.

263
00:27:10,499 --> 00:27:13,120
I need that.
I need this shit, right?

264
00:27:13,419 --> 00:27:15,245
Nicki, coffee.

265
00:27:37,610 --> 00:27:38,475
He's not here.

266
00:27:38,861 --> 00:27:41,434
Mr. Madano, how's your heaIth?

267
00:27:41,697 --> 00:27:43,108
I said, he's not here.

268
00:27:43,324 --> 00:27:44,818
I beIieve you.

269
00:27:45,826 --> 00:27:49,160
But if you won't mind,
I'd Iike to taIk to you.

270
00:28:27,284 --> 00:28:30,784
He kiIIed Bobby in front
of his wife and kids.

271
00:28:30,996 --> 00:28:32,159
What did Bobby do to him?

272
00:28:32,373 --> 00:28:34,033
Bobby didn't do nothing.

273
00:28:34,333 --> 00:28:36,326
What did the poIice do
to make him crazy?

274
00:28:36,585 --> 00:28:39,290
Two bIocks over,
he just kiIIed another woman.

275
00:28:39,755 --> 00:28:41,961
Something make him crazy.

276
00:28:42,758 --> 00:28:46,756
Bobby's chiIdren watched Richie
kiII their father.

277
00:28:48,222 --> 00:28:49,965
You know as weII as I do. . .

278
00:28:50,224 --> 00:28:53,178
. . .Richie was aIways into bad things,
even as a kid.

279
00:28:53,394 --> 00:28:54,936
But never crazy Iike this.

280
00:28:55,145 --> 00:28:57,055
He's on drugs now.
He's Iost his mind.

281
00:28:57,231 --> 00:28:59,270
Now if you've seen Richie. . .

282
00:29:00,192 --> 00:29:03,228
. . .or you know something I don't,
you better teII me.

283
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:11,569
When I came here. . .

284
00:29:12,079 --> 00:29:13,953
. . .I got a job repairing the subway.

285
00:29:15,916 --> 00:29:18,372
Same house, same job ever since.

286
00:29:19,253 --> 00:29:21,459
I come home for dinner every night.

287
00:29:22,131 --> 00:29:24,123
AImost 50 years.

288
00:29:25,342 --> 00:29:26,587
And you don't beIieve me?

289
00:29:26,802 --> 00:29:28,344
I beIieve you.

290
00:29:28,762 --> 00:29:31,336
And even then,
when I was a punk kid. . .

291
00:29:31,557 --> 00:29:33,715
. . .I beIieved you and you beIieved me.

292
00:29:36,186 --> 00:29:38,428
How can I keep you
from kiIIing my son?

293
00:29:39,815 --> 00:29:42,021
You teII Richie to get a Iawyer.

294
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:45,317
Have him turn himseIf in.

295
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:47,812
If not. . .

296
00:29:48,490 --> 00:29:50,115
. . .I'm going to kiII him.

297
00:30:22,733 --> 00:30:24,013
''Just. . .

298
00:30:26,946 --> 00:30:29,104
. . .in time. . . . ''

299
00:30:31,241 --> 00:30:32,736
Open the door.

300
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:36,615
How you been doing?

301
00:30:38,874 --> 00:30:42,872
Rica, I ain't seen you around
in a whiIe, you know?

302
00:30:43,921 --> 00:30:46,590
What'd you do,
retire or something?

303
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:50,172
I guess you couId say I retired.

304
00:30:50,427 --> 00:30:52,171
I got a job at the video store.

305
00:30:55,849 --> 00:30:58,471
-Just trying to get back to normaI.
-NormaI?

306
00:31:00,104 --> 00:31:02,013
What do you mean by ''normaI''?

307
00:31:02,815 --> 00:31:07,560
What'd you do, Rica? What'd you do?
Did you just say no?

308
00:31:07,820 --> 00:31:12,149
What are you, what's-her-name,
Nancy-fucking-Reabush?

309
00:31:12,408 --> 00:31:14,780
No, Rich, it's not Iike that.

310
00:31:24,253 --> 00:31:26,578
You wouIdn't ''just say no'' to me,
wouId you?

311
00:31:50,195 --> 00:31:51,440
How you doing?

312
00:31:51,822 --> 00:31:54,942
Hey, Officer Big Shot,
come to bust my baIIs?

313
00:31:55,284 --> 00:31:58,534
This here is a detective!
In what, narcotics now?

314
00:31:58,746 --> 00:32:01,830
-That's right.
-I want you aII to be very nice.

315
00:32:02,082 --> 00:32:04,953
TeII this mamaIuke
anything he wants to know.

316
00:32:05,210 --> 00:32:06,954
Vinnie, come over here.

317
00:32:07,171 --> 00:32:11,714
You shouIdn't taIk to me that way.
We don't know each other so good.

318
00:32:11,967 --> 00:32:15,585
You were stiII sucking your thumb
when Richie was sucking dicks.

319
00:32:15,888 --> 00:32:17,715
You shouIdn't taIk so tough.

320
00:32:18,057 --> 00:32:20,345
If Richie was here,
you wouIdn't taIk that shit.

321
00:32:20,601 --> 00:32:23,518
But he's not here.
You know why he's not here?

322
00:32:23,812 --> 00:32:27,395
Because he's a chicken-shit
fucking pussy asshoIe.

323
00:32:29,193 --> 00:32:32,277
Don't go pushing my patrons around,
you prick!

324
00:32:32,571 --> 00:32:35,655
Prick? Look around.
Is this the setting for profanity?

325
00:32:36,492 --> 00:32:37,571
Fuck you!

326
00:32:38,577 --> 00:32:40,902
Benny the Book.
How are you, buddy?

327
00:32:43,290 --> 00:32:46,327
You wouIdn't be here using Ma BeII
for iIIegaI means?

328
00:32:46,919 --> 00:32:48,995
Bookmaking's an iIIegaI activity.

329
00:32:49,254 --> 00:32:53,252
You aIso wouIdn't know Richie owns
this pIace and seIIs narcotics here. . .

330
00:32:53,467 --> 00:32:57,002
. . .because he's a fucking puke
who Iikes to pervert kids.

331
00:32:57,263 --> 00:32:59,006
Nobody uses drugs around here.

332
00:33:01,016 --> 00:33:02,890
You don't know nothing, do you?

333
00:33:09,108 --> 00:33:10,602
Anybody seen Richie?

334
00:33:13,362 --> 00:33:16,114
Anybody know why
Richie did Bobby Lupo?

335
00:33:18,909 --> 00:33:19,940
I don't know cazzo.

336
00:33:22,371 --> 00:33:23,865
Big man with a badge and gun.

337
00:33:25,457 --> 00:33:27,284
What's the password, asshoIe?

338
00:33:30,254 --> 00:33:31,796
What are you doing here?

339
00:33:32,798 --> 00:33:35,123
-You're Vito's friend.
-I got Iots of friends.

340
00:33:35,384 --> 00:33:37,840
You jump around a IittIe bit.
Is that it?

341
00:33:38,095 --> 00:33:40,633
Who's this one over here,
your girIfriend?

342
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:44,391
-You know what?
-What's that?

343
00:33:44,643 --> 00:33:48,807
Someday your mouth is going to get
your body in a Iot of troubIe.

344
00:33:49,064 --> 00:33:51,472
-Where you from, finocchio ?
-Attica.

345
00:33:51,734 --> 00:33:55,103
You couIdn't be from BrookIyn.
We don't taIk Iike that.

346
00:33:55,362 --> 00:33:58,363
Tattoo, this guy's nothing
without that badge and gun.

347
00:33:58,949 --> 00:34:00,325
You can't come back here.

348
00:34:00,534 --> 00:34:02,325
Get the fuck out of here!

349
00:34:07,708 --> 00:34:10,875
What do we got here?
What is this shit?

350
00:34:16,258 --> 00:34:18,251
Whose hot dog is this?
Yours?

351
00:34:18,469 --> 00:34:21,173
Without that badge,
they'd take your head off.

352
00:34:21,388 --> 00:34:23,180
Get the fuck out of here!

353
00:34:24,516 --> 00:34:26,592
I noticed a Iot of
boxing memorabiIia.

354
00:34:26,977 --> 00:34:31,520
We got some gIoves over here.
Pictures everywhere.

355
00:34:31,732 --> 00:34:33,274
-Who's the boxer?
-Me.

356
00:34:33,484 --> 00:34:35,856
You're the boxer? You a tough guy?

357
00:34:36,070 --> 00:34:39,071
-Tough enough.
-ReaIIy? What couId you do?

358
00:34:39,323 --> 00:34:40,319
To you?

359
00:34:46,997 --> 00:34:49,998
Vinnie, I'm starting to
get in a bad mood.

360
00:34:50,250 --> 00:34:54,711
Maybe it's a mood swing, my hormones,
or my need to impose my wiII.

361
00:34:54,964 --> 00:34:58,831
I want you teII these finocchi
to get on the fucking tabIe.

362
00:35:00,386 --> 00:35:03,256
TeII them to get up on
the fucking tabIe.

363
00:35:04,014 --> 00:35:07,798
Are you totaIIy nuts?
You couId've kiIIed somebody upstairs!

364
00:35:08,143 --> 00:35:10,717
-Nobody's upstairs!
-How wouId you know?

365
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:12,474
Did you bust in the joint?

366
00:35:14,733 --> 00:35:15,896
I don't recaII.

367
00:35:16,110 --> 00:35:19,479
The onIy baIIs he has
is that badge and gun.

368
00:35:20,948 --> 00:35:22,822
Let me show you something.

369
00:35:27,496 --> 00:35:28,907
Here's my gun!

370
00:35:29,331 --> 00:35:32,914
Fair game now, okay?
And here's my badge!

371
00:35:33,544 --> 00:35:36,249
This is your trophy.
This is your trophy, okay?

372
00:35:36,463 --> 00:35:38,088
Come and get me.

373
00:35:38,882 --> 00:35:40,958
TeII your cetrioli
to come and get it.

374
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:43,833
I offer $5,000 for
that badge right now.

375
00:35:47,725 --> 00:35:49,349
Anybody see Richie?

376
00:35:50,102 --> 00:35:53,020
Anybody know why
Richie did Bobby Lupo?

377
00:35:54,732 --> 00:35:56,938
Fuckface, you want to get by me?

378
00:35:57,192 --> 00:36:01,190
There's onIy two things stopping you:
fear and common sense.

379
00:36:01,530 --> 00:36:03,439
I'II cut your fucking head off!

380
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:16,038
Motherfucker, you knocked my teeth out!

381
00:36:18,213 --> 00:36:19,921
Hey, Sticks, come on!

382
00:36:59,213 --> 00:37:00,043
Motherfucker!

383
00:37:14,353 --> 00:37:15,516
I'm with Vittorio.

384
00:37:15,896 --> 00:37:18,103
So that means you can't touch me.

385
00:37:20,609 --> 00:37:22,436
That's right. I forgot.

386
00:37:29,535 --> 00:37:30,994
How you doing, buddy?

387
00:37:31,537 --> 00:37:35,748
-I want to taIk to your brother.
-He'II want to taIk to you himseIf.

388
00:37:36,875 --> 00:37:39,413
What are you doing?
You don't want to do that.

389
00:37:40,963 --> 00:37:43,917
TeII him I'II cut off his head
and piss down his throat.

390
00:37:44,216 --> 00:37:45,082
Fuck you!

391
00:37:59,023 --> 00:38:00,932
Anybody seen Richie?

392
00:38:03,235 --> 00:38:07,399
I'm gonna keep coming back untiI
somebody remembers seeing Richie.

393
00:40:38,891 --> 00:40:40,089
So what's the Iatest?

394
00:40:40,392 --> 00:40:43,642
The cops are aII over town,
hitting every business we own.

395
00:40:43,938 --> 00:40:45,847
AII my guys
are Iooking for this bastard.

396
00:40:46,565 --> 00:40:49,483
Vittorio, he's kiIIing peopIe
Iike it was free.

397
00:40:49,777 --> 00:40:52,184
When I'm through,
I'm going to Cono's for dinner.

398
00:40:52,404 --> 00:40:53,780
You find Gino.

399
00:40:54,073 --> 00:40:56,824
TeII him to--
Ask him to meet me there.

400
00:40:57,368 --> 00:40:59,526
And you find Richie.
I don't care how.

401
00:41:00,412 --> 00:41:01,693
You just find him.

402
00:41:02,164 --> 00:41:03,623
I'II find him.

403
00:41:09,463 --> 00:41:12,168
-TeII Joey about the mouse.
-What mouse?

404
00:41:12,424 --> 00:41:15,758
-Why? Is Joey an exterminator now?
-What about the mouse?

405
00:41:15,970 --> 00:41:20,466
I got a mouse in my house.
I pay $800 so I can chase it around.

406
00:41:20,683 --> 00:41:22,011
Shoot this rat bastard.

407
00:41:22,226 --> 00:41:25,310
The mouse is this big.
I'm going to shoot him?

408
00:41:25,521 --> 00:41:27,976
Shoot him through the fIoor,
you kiII a neighbor.

409
00:41:28,482 --> 00:41:30,439
Let's go by Chas the Chair.

410
00:41:31,110 --> 00:41:33,316
The mouse is smarter than you are.

411
00:41:33,529 --> 00:41:36,613
-Shoot this rat.
-Shut up about the fucking mouse!

412
00:41:45,499 --> 00:41:47,242
Thanks for coming.

413
00:41:47,501 --> 00:41:49,909
-PuII up a chair.
-Sit where I can see you.

414
00:41:56,135 --> 00:41:58,839
Why you got guys busting
my baIIs aII over town?

415
00:41:59,096 --> 00:42:02,097
Hurting my business.
That ain't right, Gino.

416
00:42:03,058 --> 00:42:07,436
WeII, you know, Vittorio,
I was meaning to teII you. . .

417
00:42:07,730 --> 00:42:09,639
. . .I reaIIy don't Iike you.

418
00:42:09,898 --> 00:42:12,472
And I never reaIIy did.

419
00:42:12,735 --> 00:42:16,815
If you faII off a cIiff or get arrested,
rot in jaiI for Iife. . .

420
00:42:17,072 --> 00:42:19,563
. . .I reaIIy don't care, aII right?

421
00:42:24,455 --> 00:42:28,702
Gino, I'm sorry what happened to Bobby.
I know how you Ioved him.

422
00:42:29,001 --> 00:42:32,619
But I know you don't mean
one word you just said.

423
00:42:33,422 --> 00:42:34,916
You're one of us.

424
00:42:35,132 --> 00:42:35,997
FamiIy.

425
00:42:38,344 --> 00:42:39,886
Let me teII you something.

426
00:42:40,262 --> 00:42:43,263
I'm not one of you,
and I'm not with you.

427
00:42:54,693 --> 00:42:57,315
Come on, Gino. Wait up.

428
00:42:59,865 --> 00:43:01,692
Why you taIking to the oId man
Iike that?

429
00:43:01,909 --> 00:43:05,325
Because he's your boss, not mine.
You know?

430
00:43:05,537 --> 00:43:07,495
I want to teII you something.

431
00:43:07,748 --> 00:43:09,741
You remember UncIe Pino, right?

432
00:43:10,125 --> 00:43:11,785
Yeah. The big guy.

433
00:43:12,086 --> 00:43:13,331
One time. . .

434
00:43:13,963 --> 00:43:18,506
. . .when I was a kid, Pino was
gonna take me to the movies.

435
00:43:18,717 --> 00:43:21,718
First, we go to the candy store.
Mettiamo's, remember?

436
00:43:21,971 --> 00:43:23,133
Who couId forget?

437
00:43:23,514 --> 00:43:26,634
We see this guy fiIIing
his pockets with this and that.

438
00:43:26,850 --> 00:43:28,226
Pino grabs him by the throat. . .

439
00:43:28,477 --> 00:43:31,050
. . .drags him outside,
throws him a beating.

440
00:43:32,898 --> 00:43:36,647
Puts him in the trunk of the car,
drives to the movies.

441
00:43:36,902 --> 00:43:38,396
He went to the movies?

442
00:43:40,197 --> 00:43:43,566
In the movies, I'm not watching.
I'm thinking to myseIf. . .

443
00:43:43,826 --> 00:43:46,696
. . . ''What about this guy in the trunk?''

444
00:43:48,789 --> 00:43:52,739
I think to myseIf,
''He kiIIed him. He's dead. ''

445
00:43:53,002 --> 00:43:55,409
I run to Pino. I says,
''You kiIIed the guy. ''

446
00:43:55,671 --> 00:43:59,419
Pino's bored, brings me around
the front, gives me the keys, says. . .

447
00:43:59,675 --> 00:44:01,335
. . . ''Do what you got to do. ''

448
00:44:01,677 --> 00:44:04,927
I says, ''Me? What am I going to do?
I'm 9 years oId. ''

449
00:44:05,139 --> 00:44:07,890
He gives me the keys.
I open the trunk.

450
00:44:08,142 --> 00:44:10,763
-I see this man.
-You must've been scared.

451
00:44:11,020 --> 00:44:13,345
I got Pino over here.
What am I scared of?

452
00:44:13,647 --> 00:44:17,562
I says to the guy,
''Hey you, get the fuck out of here! ''

453
00:44:18,527 --> 00:44:21,018
I bIink. He's in Hoboken.

454
00:44:21,322 --> 00:44:22,317
He took off Iike a shot?

455
00:44:22,531 --> 00:44:23,906
Like a bird.

456
00:44:24,116 --> 00:44:26,073
You scared the shit out of him.

457
00:44:27,494 --> 00:44:28,526
The son of a bitch.

458
00:44:30,039 --> 00:44:33,704
Nine years oId, I'm Iooking at Pino,
I'm thinking to myseIf. . .

459
00:44:33,959 --> 00:44:36,035
. . . ''My God, what a great guy. ''

460
00:44:37,463 --> 00:44:39,621
I aIways wanted to be a wiseguy.

461
00:44:39,882 --> 00:44:41,874
Look at us now, under God.

462
00:44:42,343 --> 00:44:45,676
Who wouId have ever thought
that I'd become a cop?

463
00:44:45,971 --> 00:44:47,596
Hey, Lucky, you know. . .

464
00:44:48,891 --> 00:44:50,930
. . .to me, God's a puppeteer.

465
00:44:52,102 --> 00:44:54,309
We're on the end of the strings.

466
00:44:54,521 --> 00:44:57,973
But God has a strange sense of humor,
you got to admit.

467
00:44:59,026 --> 00:45:00,686
Yeah, maybe you're right.

468
00:45:21,006 --> 00:45:24,340
Richie, judging by your sudden
rise to stardom. . .

469
00:45:24,551 --> 00:45:27,671
. . .I'II Iay odds this one's
got a make on it by now.

470
00:45:27,930 --> 00:45:30,717
Richie, don't!
Don't! What are you doing?

471
00:45:31,934 --> 00:45:33,476
I'm an overnight success, baby.

472
00:45:33,686 --> 00:45:37,635
I'm gonna crib here for a coupIe hours.
You got a probIem with that?

473
00:46:13,934 --> 00:46:15,559
How do I know it's reaI?

474
00:46:15,811 --> 00:46:19,939
Don't I Iook Iike an honest guy?
How bad do you want to find out?

475
00:46:28,741 --> 00:46:32,240
TeII her I'm here,
then get the fuck out of my sight.

476
00:46:35,039 --> 00:46:36,153
How you doing?

477
00:46:36,373 --> 00:46:38,366
How'd you get up here?

478
00:46:38,584 --> 00:46:42,416
-Where's Richie?
-I don't know nothing from nothing.

479
00:46:42,630 --> 00:46:44,005
Is that right?

480
00:46:51,096 --> 00:46:53,931
-Here's your drink.
-I didn't order no drink.

481
00:47:01,941 --> 00:47:04,229
Cops have been
in and out of here aII night.

482
00:47:04,443 --> 00:47:06,483
But it's you
I've been expecting.

483
00:47:06,695 --> 00:47:09,317
Kind of figured you'd save
the best for yourseIf.

484
00:47:09,657 --> 00:47:10,522
How you doing?

485
00:47:10,908 --> 00:47:13,446
I can stiII get it wet.
How about you?

486
00:47:13,702 --> 00:47:17,367
Me? I can't beIieve you
can stiII eat with that mouth.

487
00:47:21,251 --> 00:47:22,794
I feeI bad about Bobby.

488
00:47:24,463 --> 00:47:26,788
You don't know what reason
your brother had?

489
00:47:27,007 --> 00:47:29,214
Even if I knew, which I don't--

490
00:47:29,426 --> 00:47:31,633
You haven't seen your brother?

491
00:47:31,887 --> 00:47:33,880
Last time was a coupIe of days ago.

492
00:47:34,390 --> 00:47:37,675
He's aIways with a different whore.
Who's his Iatest?

493
00:47:37,893 --> 00:47:40,265
Since when do I keep track?

494
00:47:40,479 --> 00:47:42,270
Yeah, it must be tough.

495
00:47:44,775 --> 00:47:46,684
-Who's this over here?
-Which one?

496
00:47:46,902 --> 00:47:49,440
The one with nippIes
you couId diaI a phone with.

497
00:47:49,697 --> 00:47:50,895
Terry.

498
00:47:51,573 --> 00:47:52,403
Why?

499
00:47:52,616 --> 00:47:55,368
Let's cut the buIIshit.
I got to taIk to you.

500
00:47:55,619 --> 00:48:00,080
Get your fucking hands off me.
Don't push me around in my cIub!

501
00:48:00,624 --> 00:48:04,373
-What the fuck are you doing?
-I toId you to get out of here.

502
00:48:07,423 --> 00:48:09,000
You getting your rocks off?

503
00:48:09,216 --> 00:48:12,834
Is this what they teach you to do
when you're a cop? Shit!

504
00:48:13,095 --> 00:48:14,803
Have you seen your brother?

505
00:48:15,055 --> 00:48:18,424
No, I haven't.
I've toId you a miIIion times.

506
00:48:18,642 --> 00:48:20,765
What the fIying fuck are you doing?

507
00:48:20,978 --> 00:48:22,686
Have you seen your brother?

508
00:48:22,980 --> 00:48:24,854
Are you stupid?
I toId you no.

509
00:48:25,399 --> 00:48:27,855
Why don't you just destroy my office?

510
00:48:28,068 --> 00:48:31,105
If you're Iooking for my Iipstick,
it's in my bag.

511
00:48:35,784 --> 00:48:37,777
I've had enough of this.

512
00:48:39,747 --> 00:48:42,119
Look what I found.
You got a gun.

513
00:48:42,374 --> 00:48:44,450
-I got a Iicense for that.
-Where is it?

514
00:48:44,710 --> 00:48:45,873
My dog ate it.

515
00:48:46,170 --> 00:48:48,921
Let me teII you,
this is a year in jaiI.

516
00:48:49,131 --> 00:48:51,088
You think a year's a piece of cake?

517
00:48:51,383 --> 00:48:53,423
-Aren't you smart.
-Look, it's getting Iate.

518
00:48:53,886 --> 00:48:58,595
AII night I've been running into peopIe
who are deaf, dumb and bIind.

519
00:48:58,849 --> 00:49:01,554
So you know what?
I'm gonna arrest you.

520
00:49:02,937 --> 00:49:04,680
You're gonna arrest me for what?

521
00:49:04,939 --> 00:49:05,887
How does it work?

522
00:49:06,231 --> 00:49:09,185
I give you a IittIe head,
and you forget about it?

523
00:49:09,652 --> 00:49:12,143
I wouIdn't forget.
You were never that good.

524
00:49:12,363 --> 00:49:14,402
Go fuck yourseIf.

525
00:49:14,657 --> 00:49:16,151
You're under arrest.

526
00:49:19,411 --> 00:49:21,570
I'm gonna need a new go-cart.

527
00:49:22,456 --> 00:49:24,365
Something with some stomp.

528
00:49:24,959 --> 00:49:26,157
And a scanner.

529
00:49:26,543 --> 00:49:29,995
Where the fuck are your manners?
The man's taIking to you.

530
00:49:33,342 --> 00:49:36,758
There's a GNX on the top fIoor,
in the parking garage.

531
00:49:36,971 --> 00:49:41,134
Bay 1 0. Take the scanner,
wire it and bring it back.

532
00:49:43,394 --> 00:49:46,395
We're going to have us a IittIe party.

533
00:49:46,647 --> 00:49:49,102
A IittIe party, a IittIe soiree.

534
00:49:50,901 --> 00:49:55,113
Invite over a coupIe of chicks.
We can aII get Iaid, get bIowjobs.

535
00:49:56,073 --> 00:50:00,534
Hey Richie, you know I haven't gotten
no pussy since 1 969.

536
00:50:03,330 --> 00:50:07,957
No pussy since 1 969? What've you
been doing? Jerking the gherkin?

537
00:50:09,712 --> 00:50:12,962
Come on, man. That's coId.
Leave him aIone.

538
00:50:13,799 --> 00:50:15,590
What've you been doing?

539
00:50:19,263 --> 00:50:21,932
Hey, Bobby Arms! Get me a beer.

540
00:50:23,601 --> 00:50:25,558
You don't have to push me.

541
00:50:25,769 --> 00:50:30,478
UsuaIIy when you're arrested,
you can use a phone. You're kidding!

542
00:50:32,943 --> 00:50:35,944
You have not even toId me
what I've been arrested for.

543
00:50:36,405 --> 00:50:38,861
Let me see here. What couId we do?

544
00:50:39,116 --> 00:50:41,951
How about 240.25?

545
00:50:42,786 --> 00:50:45,075
-What's that?
-Prostitution, honey.

546
00:50:45,497 --> 00:50:46,992
Are you kidding me?

547
00:50:47,207 --> 00:50:48,750
Let me out now!

548
00:50:49,001 --> 00:50:51,077
I toId you I was gonna do this.

549
00:50:52,087 --> 00:50:54,294
Are you out of your fucking mind?

550
00:50:54,590 --> 00:50:56,879
I toId you I was not kidding.

551
00:50:57,134 --> 00:50:59,292
Now, how's your memory?

552
00:50:59,637 --> 00:51:00,835
Who is Roxanne?

553
00:51:01,430 --> 00:51:03,553
You're starting to piss me off.

554
00:51:04,224 --> 00:51:06,513
Did you ever find this one
on the street?

555
00:51:06,769 --> 00:51:08,560
-Many times.
-How much was she?

556
00:51:08,771 --> 00:51:11,522
-Ten bucks.
-Ten bucks this, friend.

557
00:51:11,774 --> 00:51:14,229
Fuck you!
I can't beIieve you're doing this.

558
00:51:14,485 --> 00:51:17,735
I'm disappointed.
I thought you couId get at Ieast 1 5.

559
00:51:19,823 --> 00:51:23,323
Gino, you fuck! Get me out of here!

560
00:51:29,959 --> 00:51:32,200
Come on, Chas. Have another drink.

561
00:51:40,511 --> 00:51:42,918
What's the story with you and that cop?

562
00:51:45,224 --> 00:51:47,181
Who? Gino?

563
00:51:49,228 --> 00:51:52,395
The one you popped.
Was that business?

564
00:51:52,731 --> 00:51:54,523
Or was it personaI?

565
00:51:58,112 --> 00:51:59,689
It was personaI business.

566
00:52:05,452 --> 00:52:06,650
HoIy shit!

567
00:52:06,870 --> 00:52:09,159
Why are you asking me
about my business?

568
00:52:09,415 --> 00:52:11,372
Richie, cops! Cops!

569
00:52:12,001 --> 00:52:13,329
You rat me out?

570
00:52:13,544 --> 00:52:14,457
No, never.

571
00:52:14,753 --> 00:52:15,749
You rat bastard!

572
00:52:16,005 --> 00:52:17,582
I'd never rat you out.

573
00:52:18,799 --> 00:52:21,919
-I'II put you out of your misery.
-PIease, don't!

574
00:52:31,145 --> 00:52:33,517
-Get your hands up!
-Nobody move!

575
00:52:34,648 --> 00:52:38,480
Why did you have to shoot him?
He didn't rat us out.

576
00:53:38,587 --> 00:53:39,583
How you doing?

577
00:53:39,838 --> 00:53:43,172
You arrest Patricia because
she no heIp you find Richard.

578
00:53:43,384 --> 00:53:47,132
Yeah, but just the same,
maybe we couId taIk a minute.

579
00:53:51,392 --> 00:53:53,930
You sit down right over here.

580
00:54:05,781 --> 00:54:07,987
This is difficuIt for me to say.

581
00:54:08,617 --> 00:54:11,239
I'm sorry for the way
I behaved in your home.

582
00:54:11,453 --> 00:54:15,403
It was disrespectfuI.
You've aIways been Iike a father to me.

583
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:18,291
If you teII me. . .

584
00:54:19,044 --> 00:54:22,544
. . .that you haven't seen Richie,
I beIieve you. We got probIems.

585
00:54:27,136 --> 00:54:28,844
I know that it's--

586
00:54:29,138 --> 00:54:31,463
No man wants to bury his son.

587
00:54:33,434 --> 00:54:34,714
And I know. . .

588
00:54:35,269 --> 00:54:37,641
. . .no man wants to admit
that his son. . .

589
00:54:37,855 --> 00:54:40,310
. . .has become something
the worId can do without.

590
00:54:42,443 --> 00:54:43,985
But I'm very afraid. . .

591
00:54:45,321 --> 00:54:48,321
. . .every moment
for everyone around us.

592
00:54:50,451 --> 00:54:51,909
I pray. . .

593
00:54:52,703 --> 00:54:54,411
. . .for this to end.

594
00:54:56,915 --> 00:54:59,122
I know what you're trying to say.

595
00:55:11,138 --> 00:55:15,966
I'm gonna have to
make you stay downtown tonight.

596
00:55:32,534 --> 00:55:35,654
Jerry, that's robbery, not narcotics.

597
00:55:36,580 --> 00:55:39,783
TaIk to Donziger and get back to me.

598
00:55:40,167 --> 00:55:41,792
I'II taIk to you.

599
00:55:59,061 --> 00:56:01,137
Does this Iook famiIiar?

600
00:56:09,613 --> 00:56:11,440
I heIp you, he'II kiII me.

601
00:56:11,782 --> 00:56:13,442
He's your own brother!

602
00:56:13,659 --> 00:56:17,028
He's a vacuum.
He sucks up three to four grams a pass.

603
00:56:17,246 --> 00:56:19,701
That doesn't promote
rationaI thought.

604
00:56:20,624 --> 00:56:24,871
It'II get worse. I been teIIing you.
I got your father under arrest.

605
00:56:25,087 --> 00:56:26,996
It won't work, Gino!

606
00:56:27,256 --> 00:56:29,498
God, why don't you understand this?

607
00:56:30,843 --> 00:56:32,551
We can't heIp you.

608
00:56:32,803 --> 00:56:36,172
-If he thinks we did, he'II kiII Pop.
-He's that far gone?

609
00:56:36,432 --> 00:56:38,140
BeIieve it, Gino.

610
00:56:38,726 --> 00:56:40,136
Anybody.

611
00:56:40,644 --> 00:56:43,847
Then I'm gonna keep you here
tonight and keep you aIive.

612
00:56:44,064 --> 00:56:45,606
Hate me tomorrow.

613
00:56:53,157 --> 00:56:54,734
In the 8-0 precinct.

614
00:56:55,034 --> 00:56:59,577
Signal 1 01 3. Police officer shot.
6835 Amboy Street.

615
00:57:00,122 --> 00:57:04,167
This is one night this town
ain't ever gonna forget about.

616
00:57:04,376 --> 00:57:07,163
Ask me, I think you aIready
made sure of that.

617
00:57:07,421 --> 00:57:11,371
Your wife called.
She's at your apartment with Tony.

618
00:57:11,634 --> 00:57:14,551
Any chance you can swing over there
for a minute?

619
00:57:15,804 --> 00:57:18,722
I could do that.
I'm right in the area.

620
00:57:20,684 --> 00:57:23,354
Come here. Come over here.

621
00:57:27,107 --> 00:57:30,559
I aImost forgot about you.

622
00:57:30,986 --> 00:57:34,735
I gotta get you
a nice hot bath, some food.

623
00:57:35,199 --> 00:57:37,820
Maybe a girIfriend or something.

624
00:58:01,517 --> 00:58:02,430
How's Tony?

625
00:58:02,768 --> 00:58:03,633
He's fine.

626
00:58:06,438 --> 00:58:07,719
Have you eaten anything?

627
00:58:08,023 --> 00:58:10,230
A coupIe of dog biscuits.

628
00:58:10,567 --> 00:58:12,441
-My new dog.
-Look at you.

629
00:58:13,821 --> 00:58:16,490
-A poIice dog?
-This is Coraggio.

630
00:58:17,366 --> 00:58:18,481
You gonna keep him?

631
00:58:18,701 --> 00:58:20,409
I'm thinking about it.

632
00:58:21,537 --> 00:58:24,206
Maybe.
It depends on how brave he is.

633
00:58:26,792 --> 00:58:28,619
I better go and see Tony.

634
00:58:33,048 --> 00:58:35,171
You want to come up
for an espresso?

635
00:58:35,467 --> 00:58:37,875
Yeah. Why not?

636
00:58:38,804 --> 00:58:41,093
You stay there and be a good boy.

637
00:58:44,685 --> 00:58:49,062
-ShouId we show the dog to Tony?
-He'II never go back to sIeep.

638
00:58:49,273 --> 00:58:51,016
Did you ever have a dog?

639
00:58:51,275 --> 00:58:55,438
Are you kidding? We didn't have
enough money to feed ourseIves.

640
00:58:55,696 --> 00:59:00,073
There was this oId man who came
to the neighborhood when we were kids.

641
00:59:00,868 --> 00:59:02,991
He was from the oId country.

642
00:59:03,495 --> 00:59:05,737
Carried an oId schooI beII.

643
00:59:05,998 --> 00:59:10,909
He'd puII aIong this IittIe sharpening
machine operated by a foot peddIe.

644
00:59:12,171 --> 00:59:16,998
The neighbors used to come get
their knives and scissors sharpened.

645
00:59:17,259 --> 00:59:19,252
A dime here, a quarter there.

646
00:59:19,762 --> 00:59:21,754
But it was an honest Iiving.

647
00:59:22,097 --> 00:59:23,640
Time goes on. . .

648
00:59:23,891 --> 00:59:25,599
. . .peopIe start buying. . .

649
00:59:25,851 --> 00:59:28,603
. . .disposabIe scissors and knives.

650
00:59:29,229 --> 00:59:31,352
Fewer and fewer peopIe come out.

651
00:59:31,857 --> 00:59:33,684
I aIways used to think to myseIf. . .

652
00:59:34,151 --> 00:59:36,191
. . .how it wouId feeI to Ieave. . .

653
00:59:36,445 --> 00:59:38,188
. . .before Iight. . .

654
00:59:38,656 --> 00:59:40,529
. . .and come back after dark. . .

655
00:59:40,741 --> 00:59:45,118
. . .with nothing to show your wife
and famiIy for what you've done.

656
00:59:47,873 --> 00:59:51,657
That beII was the IoneIiest
sound I ever heard.

657
00:59:53,879 --> 00:59:55,587
He was your father?

658
00:59:58,342 --> 01:00:02,007
I remember one time I foIIowed
the oId man for a whoIe summer. . .

659
01:00:02,263 --> 01:00:03,507
. . .every day. . .

660
01:00:03,764 --> 01:00:05,306
. . .day in, day out.

661
01:00:07,601 --> 01:00:11,646
And after a whiIe,
it started to grind him down.

662
01:00:12,898 --> 01:00:15,982
Nobody. Nobody needs him, you know?

663
01:00:16,652 --> 01:00:19,107
You feeI Iike nobody needs you. . .

664
01:00:19,905 --> 01:00:21,814
. . .and you feeI useIess. . .

665
01:00:26,203 --> 01:00:28,077
. . .you die inside.

666
01:00:31,458 --> 01:00:33,332
You Iet yourseIf go.

667
01:00:34,670 --> 01:00:38,288
We aIways used to teII everybody,
''Pop died from cancer. ''

668
01:00:39,049 --> 01:00:41,208
I beIieve he died of a broken heart.

669
01:00:42,469 --> 01:00:44,213
After Pop died. . .

670
01:00:45,764 --> 01:00:49,548
. . .and the neighborhood kids wanted
to go to Coney IsIand to pIay. . .

671
01:00:50,894 --> 01:00:53,564
. . .one of the other fathers,
Mr. Madano. . .

672
01:00:53,814 --> 01:00:57,681
. . .used to sIip me a IittIe money so
I couId pIay with the kids too.

673
01:01:05,242 --> 01:01:09,785
You want to know how I repay
Mr. Madano, how I thanked him tonight?

674
01:01:10,789 --> 01:01:12,070
I arrested him.

675
01:01:12,875 --> 01:01:14,867
Just so I couId get to Richie.

676
01:01:16,545 --> 01:01:18,502
That's how crazy I get.

677
01:01:20,007 --> 01:01:24,005
Gino, these may be your streets
and your neighborhood. . .

678
01:01:25,429 --> 01:01:27,172
. . .but there are other cops.

679
01:01:28,933 --> 01:01:30,925
I'm reaIIy proud of what you do.

680
01:01:33,562 --> 01:01:35,851
And I know how everybody Ioves you.

681
01:01:36,774 --> 01:01:38,813
But Tony needs a father. . .

682
01:01:39,693 --> 01:01:41,353
. . .and I need a husband.

683
01:01:44,239 --> 01:01:47,324
Are we taIking
reconciIiation over here?

684
01:01:47,660 --> 01:01:50,281
No, we're taIking a Iifetime deaI.

685
01:01:50,996 --> 01:01:52,574
AII or nothing.

686
01:01:55,292 --> 01:01:56,621
I couId do that.

687
01:01:57,252 --> 01:01:58,747
That I couId do.

688
01:02:12,101 --> 01:02:13,429
I Iove you.

689
01:02:34,748 --> 01:02:36,955
-We need Tony!
-Get down in the bathtub!

690
01:02:37,167 --> 01:02:38,827
Okay. In the bathtub.

691
01:03:18,542 --> 01:03:19,740
You're dead.

692
01:03:28,802 --> 01:03:30,629
Come on, you rat bastard!

693
01:03:36,393 --> 01:03:37,508
Drop it!

694
01:03:39,063 --> 01:03:40,806
You'd shoot an unarmed man?

695
01:03:41,106 --> 01:03:44,060
I wouIdn't.
You know what I'm gonna do?

696
01:03:44,318 --> 01:03:46,061
You motherfucker!

697
01:03:57,831 --> 01:04:01,615
Angie, send me units
over to my apartment.

698
01:04:01,877 --> 01:04:04,878
There's been a shooting
over at my place.

699
01:04:05,172 --> 01:04:08,837
It's Richie Madano 's crew.
They're all deceased.

700
01:04:16,934 --> 01:04:19,888
They'II take you to a hoteI
with your mother.

701
01:04:22,773 --> 01:04:26,985
I know that this is not an easy thing,
and I know you're upset.

702
01:04:27,236 --> 01:04:29,228
I'II take care of it right away.

703
01:04:34,785 --> 01:04:35,698
Shit!

704
01:04:38,289 --> 01:04:39,320
FeIIas. . .

705
01:04:39,999 --> 01:04:40,912
. . .have a drink.

706
01:04:41,292 --> 01:04:42,406
Never mind that buIIshit.

707
01:04:42,626 --> 01:04:43,907
Sit down, dickhead.

708
01:04:44,920 --> 01:04:47,542
We're Iooking for your brother.
Where is he?

709
01:04:48,424 --> 01:04:50,215
He ain't been around.
I ain't seen him.

710
01:04:50,426 --> 01:04:52,003
You understand EngIish?

711
01:04:52,219 --> 01:04:53,927
Teach this guy some EngIish.

712
01:04:54,138 --> 01:04:56,925
You fucking bum!
Give me the right answer.

713
01:04:57,141 --> 01:04:59,596
Where's your fucking brother?
You cocksucker!

714
01:04:59,852 --> 01:05:01,679
I'II break your fucking head!

715
01:05:01,895 --> 01:05:06,225
You're both dead, you fucking bums!
The two of you! TeII him that!

716
01:05:06,442 --> 01:05:10,309
Say Rusty toId you you're dead!
You're dead, the two of you!

717
01:05:14,992 --> 01:05:16,367
You asshoIe!

718
01:05:24,543 --> 01:05:26,702
Get the fuck out of here!

719
01:05:28,213 --> 01:05:30,040
Get the fuck out of here, man!

720
01:05:32,551 --> 01:05:35,042
I bet you're real popular
in your neighborhood now.

721
01:05:35,262 --> 01:05:38,548
Angie, I was never too popuIar
with my neighbors.

722
01:05:38,849 --> 01:05:40,391
I'm heading to I'Amore's now.

723
01:05:58,744 --> 01:06:00,119
Patti back yet?

724
01:06:00,704 --> 01:06:04,784
Can I taIk to you in private
for a minute, pIease? Over there.

725
01:06:07,711 --> 01:06:09,087
Sit over here.

726
01:06:15,386 --> 01:06:16,666
Is this you?

727
01:06:17,471 --> 01:06:18,799
My name's Terry MaIIoy.

728
01:06:19,014 --> 01:06:20,674
So who's Roxanne?

729
01:06:20,933 --> 01:06:23,424
Richie's girIfriend.
That who you're Iooking for?

730
01:06:23,644 --> 01:06:25,720
That is.
Where can I find her?

731
01:06:26,897 --> 01:06:30,064
I think she Iives here in BrookIyn,
but I don't know where.

732
01:06:30,276 --> 01:06:33,941
You don't know where. What are you,
a concerned citizen now?

733
01:06:34,154 --> 01:06:35,103
Why not?

734
01:06:35,364 --> 01:06:36,858
Who's Richie to you, anyway?

735
01:06:37,241 --> 01:06:38,818
A piece of shit.

736
01:06:40,035 --> 01:06:41,827
So how come you been crying?

737
01:06:43,539 --> 01:06:45,282
I got a fucking migraine.

738
01:06:48,002 --> 01:06:50,243
Listen, I want to ask you something.

739
01:06:51,130 --> 01:06:52,209
Do you know this girI?

740
01:06:57,928 --> 01:07:00,087
Maybe you couId sit over here.

741
01:07:01,307 --> 01:07:02,469
You aII right?

742
01:07:04,560 --> 01:07:05,591
Come on, Terry.

743
01:07:08,147 --> 01:07:09,689
You have to taIk to me.

744
01:07:13,360 --> 01:07:14,689
Who is it?

745
01:07:14,945 --> 01:07:16,653
It's Roxanne.

746
01:07:18,616 --> 01:07:20,692
And you were fucking Bobby
at the same time?

747
01:07:21,118 --> 01:07:24,036
Don't be that way.
Come on. SettIe down.

748
01:07:29,376 --> 01:07:30,574
She got a Iast name?

749
01:07:31,128 --> 01:07:32,871
Ford. Roxanne Ford.

750
01:08:12,544 --> 01:08:14,204
How you doing, Vermeer?

751
01:08:16,215 --> 01:08:19,465
How the heII did you get up here?
Jesus Christ!

752
01:08:22,137 --> 01:08:24,296
He didn't have nothing to do with it.

753
01:08:35,776 --> 01:08:40,771
Where you been? We been waiting
around here aII night for you.

754
01:08:45,577 --> 01:08:47,487
What you been waiting on?

755
01:08:49,248 --> 01:08:50,327
What?

756
01:08:50,874 --> 01:08:52,748
Waiting on if you need us.

757
01:08:52,960 --> 01:08:54,537
What happened to your nose?

758
01:08:56,880 --> 01:09:00,380
Gino came around, pIaying the roIe.
Busting up the pIace.

759
01:09:00,676 --> 01:09:02,467
What, you ain't got a piece?

760
01:09:04,930 --> 01:09:06,804
You got a piece behind the bar.

761
01:09:07,224 --> 01:09:10,225
You Iet him do that to your face?
Why didn't you whack him?

762
01:09:10,561 --> 01:09:13,846
AII I heard was you cIipped Bobby.
Now I gotta whack a cop too?

763
01:09:15,107 --> 01:09:18,143
Nobody has to worry about you
stepping on your dick.

764
01:09:21,280 --> 01:09:25,491
You know how wacko he gets!
And with you doing Bobby Iike that!

765
01:09:26,035 --> 01:09:30,412
You're mistaking me
for someone that gives a shit.

766
01:09:30,998 --> 01:09:34,782
If Gino and me bang heads,
he'II be racked in a cIosed casket.

767
01:09:37,129 --> 01:09:39,798
You saying you won't
Iet him take you?

768
01:09:40,466 --> 01:09:41,876
What are you, a cIown?

769
01:09:43,802 --> 01:09:46,128
Take me? Take me where?

770
01:09:53,854 --> 01:09:56,179
You Iet one motherfucker take you!

771
01:09:56,440 --> 01:10:01,316
It ain't just Gino. BuIIs are banging
doors aII over the neighborhood.

772
01:10:02,529 --> 01:10:04,154
Frankie's guys are back!

773
01:10:04,406 --> 01:10:08,949
Them too! Every coupIe of hours
a different bunch comes sIapping me.

774
01:10:09,203 --> 01:10:11,741
Stop whining Iike a cunt
and get your piece.

775
01:10:18,128 --> 01:10:19,077
I can't.

776
01:10:22,007 --> 01:10:23,964
Don't Iet me see you again.

777
01:10:25,761 --> 01:10:28,797
Don't ever fucking
Iet me see you again.

778
01:10:35,896 --> 01:10:38,601
Good evening, feIIas.
Nice to see you again.

779
01:10:39,733 --> 01:10:42,271
Never mind the buIIshit.
Where the fuck is he?

780
01:10:42,778 --> 01:10:43,774
Over here, SaI.

781
01:11:00,379 --> 01:11:01,754
You Iose.

782
01:12:26,298 --> 01:12:27,627
Who's she?

783
01:12:29,218 --> 01:12:32,836
She brought me to the girIfriend.
She just identified the body. . .

784
01:12:33,055 --> 01:12:35,380
. . .so she's a IittIe upset.

785
01:12:35,933 --> 01:12:38,554
Did you have breakfast this morning?

786
01:12:39,436 --> 01:12:41,559
Good. Because it ain't pretty.

787
01:12:53,075 --> 01:12:56,526
-What is it?
-They kiIIed AIIie and three of the guys.

788
01:12:57,705 --> 01:12:59,329
It's no good.

789
01:12:59,748 --> 01:13:00,697
Let's find Richie.

790
01:13:04,003 --> 01:13:07,835
O'KeIIy, get upstairs and make them
photograph that thing right.

791
01:13:08,048 --> 01:13:09,590
You got it.

792
01:13:14,555 --> 01:13:17,591
This is what I found in Bobby's desk.

793
01:13:18,517 --> 01:13:22,729
Bobby was doing this one and
the one in the car at the same time.

794
01:13:23,314 --> 01:13:27,525
From the extreme rigor mortis
in the body, it Iooks Iike. . .

795
01:13:27,735 --> 01:13:31,068
. . .time of death, 24 hours ago.
Before Bobby.

796
01:13:33,407 --> 01:13:35,530
I'm getting too oId for this shit.

797
01:13:35,743 --> 01:13:37,320
I know what you mean.

798
01:14:04,104 --> 01:14:06,311
Keep it down.
My sister's sIeeping.

799
01:14:06,523 --> 01:14:10,521
Wake her up.
We ain't disturbing you, are we?

800
01:14:11,195 --> 01:14:12,855
Rica, come here.

801
01:14:13,364 --> 01:14:15,190
We're wanting a IittIe party.

802
01:14:17,618 --> 01:14:19,278
I want a IittIe party.

803
01:14:19,536 --> 01:14:22,110
Kind of my going-away party.
Right, Bobby?

804
01:14:22,331 --> 01:14:23,790
Right, Rich.

805
01:14:24,041 --> 01:14:26,614
You ain't got a probIem
with that, do you?

806
01:14:26,835 --> 01:14:28,294
No, Rich. No probIem.

807
01:14:38,222 --> 01:14:40,298
Angie? Get me Gino.
It's PicoIino.

808
01:14:40,599 --> 01:14:44,549
CaII up WiIIy the Pimp.
Have him send over his best broads.

809
01:14:44,770 --> 01:14:47,854
Nobody wiII say you hung out
with me just for the money.

810
01:14:54,488 --> 01:14:56,196
Richie, pIease. Come on.

811
01:14:59,368 --> 01:15:01,444
I'II take care of you.

812
01:15:01,662 --> 01:15:03,453
I'II take care of you.

813
01:15:05,833 --> 01:15:06,864
Hey, boys!

814
01:15:07,918 --> 01:15:10,623
We're gonna have us
a good time tonight.

815
01:15:10,963 --> 01:15:13,252
Big time, Richie. Big time.

816
01:15:13,507 --> 01:15:16,591
It's my night! My Iast night!

817
01:15:22,182 --> 01:15:23,380
Who is it?

818
01:15:33,569 --> 01:15:34,648
How you doing, Laura?

819
01:15:34,903 --> 01:15:37,691
Good. Okay.
I couIdn't sIeep after Vick Ieft.

820
01:15:37,948 --> 01:15:40,522
So I had a bath.
I'm better now.

821
01:15:51,170 --> 01:15:52,878
What are you doing?

822
01:15:53,172 --> 01:15:54,963
What are you Iooking for?

823
01:15:56,258 --> 01:15:58,547
No! No, Gino, that's my purse.

824
01:15:58,802 --> 01:16:00,961
Give me that. Gino, stop!

825
01:16:07,853 --> 01:16:08,719
What's this?

826
01:16:11,106 --> 01:16:12,482
What is this?

827
01:16:12,691 --> 01:16:15,645
Is this what Richie threw on Bobby
after he shot him?

828
01:16:16,820 --> 01:16:18,101
That was fast thinking.

829
01:16:18,697 --> 01:16:20,856
Just Iike a good cop's wife wouId.

830
01:16:22,993 --> 01:16:24,404
You know what I think?

831
01:16:24,620 --> 01:16:26,743
I think you found this somewhere. . .

832
01:16:26,956 --> 01:16:29,328
. . .and got so mad
you couIdn't see straight.

833
01:16:29,625 --> 01:16:34,750
And you sent one to Richie, never
dreaming he might actuaIIy kiII Bobby.

834
01:16:36,757 --> 01:16:39,462
I took it because
I wanted to protect him.

835
01:16:40,511 --> 01:16:43,002
See, this is Roxanne, here.

836
01:16:43,430 --> 01:16:47,380
Twenty-four years oId.
Richie kiIIed her first.

837
01:16:47,601 --> 01:16:49,677
No. You got it aII wrong.

838
01:16:50,187 --> 01:16:53,058
I onIy took it
so peopIe wouIdn't know.

839
01:16:53,274 --> 01:16:54,816
Bobby was dirty, wasn't he?

840
01:16:55,651 --> 01:16:57,145
Or maybe. . .

841
01:16:57,444 --> 01:17:00,648
. . .he was just doing Richie's
girIfriend at the same time.

842
01:17:00,948 --> 01:17:02,323
I don't think so.

843
01:17:03,117 --> 01:17:06,901
I think Bobby aIways wanted
to be Iike somebody eIse.

844
01:17:07,121 --> 01:17:11,498
He Iiked Richie's IifestyIe, his money.
And you knew he was dirty.

845
01:17:12,001 --> 01:17:14,408
Bobby's gone now.
So are Iots of others.

846
01:17:14,628 --> 01:17:16,835
I didn't want to kiII him.

847
01:17:17,089 --> 01:17:19,627
I just wanted to save my marriage.

848
01:17:20,092 --> 01:17:21,634
Come here, Laura.

849
01:17:23,762 --> 01:17:26,300
I want my Bobby back.

850
01:17:26,724 --> 01:17:28,432
I want him back.

851
01:17:33,814 --> 01:17:36,601
You have an emergency phone call
from Picolino.

852
01:17:36,817 --> 01:17:38,726
Patch me through right now.

853
01:17:46,577 --> 01:17:49,578
Listen to me, PicoIino.
I know that pIace.

854
01:17:50,122 --> 01:17:52,245
Get out of the neighborhood. Now.

855
01:19:01,860 --> 01:19:03,271
You in or out?

856
01:19:03,654 --> 01:19:04,899
I'm in.

857
01:21:00,104 --> 01:21:01,764
Hands on the fucking tabIe!

858
01:21:01,981 --> 01:21:03,095
What's going on?

859
01:21:19,957 --> 01:21:21,784
My buddy Gino's here.

860
01:21:24,545 --> 01:21:26,039
I gotta go pIay.

861
01:22:17,598 --> 01:22:18,629
Fuck you, cop!

862
01:22:32,237 --> 01:22:33,317
In the bathroom!

863
01:22:49,296 --> 01:22:51,004
What're you gonna do?

864
01:22:51,507 --> 01:22:54,176
What are you gonna do, arrest me?

865
01:22:54,385 --> 01:22:56,093
I'm out of buIIets!

866
01:23:00,224 --> 01:23:01,635
That's a shame.

867
01:23:02,017 --> 01:23:04,639
Those buIIets couId've
saved you a Iot of pain.

868
01:23:04,895 --> 01:23:06,603
I Iike pain, you know.

869
01:24:54,546 --> 01:24:56,089
I'II kiII you.

870
01:25:04,306 --> 01:25:06,014
That's for Bobby.

871
01:25:09,395 --> 01:25:11,802
-What happened?
-I took one right here.

872
01:25:13,315 --> 01:25:15,391
What're you doing with my gun?

873
01:25:17,278 --> 01:25:19,436
What the heII is wrong with you?
Jesus Christ!

874
01:25:19,655 --> 01:25:22,407
-You did the right thing.
-I did the right thing?

875
01:25:25,160 --> 01:25:27,568
I'm sorry it had to be this way.

876
01:25:27,871 --> 01:25:30,327
TeII the boss what you did.
Do the rituaI thing.

877
01:25:30,541 --> 01:25:31,537
Are you sick?

878
01:25:31,792 --> 01:25:32,657
Just a IittIe.

879
01:25:32,876 --> 01:25:35,450
Put him in a fucking trunk in Jersey.

880
01:25:36,672 --> 01:25:38,711
That sounds great, but. . .

881
01:25:38,966 --> 01:25:42,501
. . .can't we have dinner in the city,
me and you aIone sometime?

882
01:25:42,970 --> 01:25:45,295
I won't even bring my beeper.

883
01:25:46,056 --> 01:25:48,382
Speaking of food,
I couId go for. . .

884
01:25:48,726 --> 01:25:52,260
. . .a chiIi hot dog with
cheese and french fries.

885
01:25:52,521 --> 01:25:56,815
Not for nothing. It's 9:00 a.m.
Eat here, you'II have gangrene by noon.

886
01:25:57,735 --> 01:26:00,652
I'm going to buy you
a nice romantic--

887
01:26:08,162 --> 01:26:09,442
Yo, fucknuts!

888
01:26:11,457 --> 01:26:12,915
You taIking to me?

889
01:26:13,125 --> 01:26:16,909
You the guy who threw a puppy
out of the car the other day?

890
01:26:17,171 --> 01:26:20,337
-What's your business, anyway?
-I'm an animaI Iover.

891
01:26:20,633 --> 01:26:21,831
AnimaI Iover?

892
01:26:22,760 --> 01:26:26,211
You don't mind your business,
I'II stuff you in a bag. . .

893
01:26:26,430 --> 01:26:28,304
. . .and throw you out a window.

894
01:26:28,557 --> 01:26:32,092
-You a tough guy?
-I'II show you how tough I am.

895
01:26:38,692 --> 01:26:40,352
My baIIs!

896
01:26:54,833 --> 01:26:58,914
Oh, Vick, Iook over here!
Is that a poIice dog, or what?
