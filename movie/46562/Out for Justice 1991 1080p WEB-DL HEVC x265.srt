476
00:42:24,563 --> 00:42:28,233
But I know you don't mean
one word you just said.

477
00:42:29,025 --> 00:42:31,570
You're one of us. Family.

478
00:42:33,905 --> 00:42:35,448
Let me tell you something.

479
00:42:35,866 --> 00:42:38,869
I'm not one of you, and I'm not with you.

480
00:42:50,255 --> 00:42:52,924
Come on, Gino. Wait up.

481
00:42:55,426 --> 00:42:57,262
Why you talking to the old man like that?

482
00:42:57,470 --> 00:43:00,932
Because he's your boss,
not mine. You know?

483
00:43:01,099 --> 00:43:03,101
I want to tell you something.

484
00:43:03,351 --> 00:43:05,353
You remember Uncle Pino, right?

485
00:43:05,729 --> 00:43:07,397
Yeah. The big guy.

486
00:43:07,648 --> 00:43:08,940
One time

487
00:43:09,565 --> 00:43:14,112
when I was a kid,
Pino was gonna take me to the movies.

488
00:43:14,279 --> 00:43:17,282
First, we go to the candy store.
Mettiamo's, remember?

489
00:43:17,573 --> 00:43:18,742
Who could forget?

490
00:43:19,117 --> 00:43:22,245
We see this guy filling his pockets
with this and that.

491
00:43:22,453 --> 00:43:23,789
Pino grabs him by the throat,

492
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:26,625
drags him outside,
throws him a beating.

493
00:43:28,459 --> 00:43:32,255
Puts him in the trunk of the car,
drives to the movies.

494
00:43:32,463 --> 00:43:33,965
He went to the movies?

495
00:43:35,801 --> 00:43:39,137
In the movies, I'm not watching.
I'm thinking to myself,

496
00:43:39,429 --> 00:43:42,307
"What about this guy in the trunk?"

497
00:43:44,392 --> 00:43:48,313
I think to myself,
"He killed him. He's dead."

498
00:43:48,604 --> 00:43:50,982
I run to Pino.
I says, "You killed the guy."

499
00:43:51,274 --> 00:43:54,986
Pino's bored, brings me around the front,
gives me the keys, says,

500
00:43:55,278 --> 00:43:56,947
"Do what you got to do."

501
00:43:57,280 --> 00:44:00,491
I says, "Me? What am I going to do?
I'm nine years old."

502
00:44:00,701 --> 00:44:03,494
He gives me the keys. I open the trunk.

503
00:44:03,704 --> 00:44:06,331
-I see this man.
-You must've been scared.

504
00:44:06,622 --> 00:44:08,959
I got Pino over here. What am I scared of?

505
00:44:09,209 --> 00:44:13,171
I says to the guy,
"Hey you, get the fuck out of here!"

506
00:44:14,130 --> 00:44:16,632
I blink. He's in Hoboken.

507
00:44:16,925 --> 00:44:17,926
He took off like a shot?

508
00:44:18,134 --> 00:44:19,510
Like a bird.

509
00:44:19,678 --> 00:44:21,680
You scared the shit out of him.

510
00:44:23,056 --> 00:44:24,140
The son of a bitch.

511
00:44:25,641 --> 00:44:29,312
Nine years old, I'm looking at Pino,
I'm thinking to myself,

512
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:31,647
"My God, what a great guy."

513
00:44:33,024 --> 00:44:35,193
I always wanted to be a wiseguy.

514
00:44:35,485 --> 00:44:37,487
Look at us now, under God.

515
00:44:37,946 --> 00:44:41,241
Who would have ever thought
that I'd become a cop?

516
00:44:41,532 --> 00:44:43,201
Hey, Lucky, you know,

517
00:44:44,494 --> 00:44:46,537
to me, God's a puppeteer.

518
00:44:47,706 --> 00:44:49,875
We're on the end of the strings.

519
00:44:50,083 --> 00:44:53,544
But God has a strange sense of humor,
you got to admit.

520
00:44:54,587 --> 00:44:56,256
Yeah, maybe you're right.

521
00:45:01,177 --> 00:45:02,387
(CAR HORN HONKS)

522
00:45:16,567 --> 00:45:19,905
Richie, judging by your sudden
rise to stardom,

523
00:45:20,113 --> 00:45:23,241
I'll lay odds this one's
got a make on it by now.

524
00:45:23,533 --> 00:45:26,286
CHAS: Richie, don't!
Don't! What are you doing?

525
00:45:27,537 --> 00:45:29,080
I'm an overnight success, baby.

526
00:45:29,247 --> 00:45:33,251
I'm gonna crib here for a couple hours.
You got a problem with that?

527
00:46:09,537 --> 00:46:11,122
How do I know it's real?

528
00:46:11,414 --> 00:46:15,543
Don't I look like an honest guy?
How bad do you want to find out?

529
00:46:24,302 --> 00:46:27,805
Tell her I'm here,
then get the fuck out of my sight.

530
00:46:30,641 --> 00:46:31,767
How you doing?

531
00:46:31,977 --> 00:46:33,979
BARTENDER: How'd you get up here?

532
00:46:34,145 --> 00:46:37,983
-Tell me where Richie is.
-I don't know nothing from nothing.

533
00:46:38,191 --> 00:46:39,609
Is that right?

534
00:46:46,657 --> 00:46:49,494
-Here's your drink.
-I didn't order no drink.

535
00:46:57,502 --> 00:46:59,837
Cops have been
in and out of here all night.

536
00:47:00,005 --> 00:47:02,090
But it's you I've been expecting.

537
00:47:02,298 --> 00:47:04,885
Kind of figured you'd save
the best for yourself.

538
00:47:05,218 --> 00:47:06,219
How you doing?

539
00:47:06,511 --> 00:47:09,014
I can still get it wet. How about you?

540
00:47:09,305 --> 00:47:12,976
Me? I can't believe you
can still eat with that mouth.

541
00:47:16,854 --> 00:47:18,356
I feel bad about Bobby.

542
00:47:20,025 --> 00:47:22,360
You don't know what reason
your brother had?

543
00:47:22,610 --> 00:47:24,820
PATTI: Even if I knew, which I don't...

544
00:47:25,030 --> 00:47:27,198
I'm sure you haven't seen your brother?

545
00:47:27,490 --> 00:47:29,492
Last time was a couple of days ago.

546
00:47:29,993 --> 00:47:33,246
He's always with a different whore.
Who's his latest?

547
00:47:33,496 --> 00:47:35,873
Since when do I keep track?

548
00:47:36,041 --> 00:47:37,875
Yeah, it must be tough.

549
00:47:40,378 --> 00:47:42,255
-Who's this over here?
-Which one?

550
00:47:42,505 --> 00:47:45,050
The one with nipples
you could dial a phone with.

551
00:47:45,258 --> 00:47:48,011
Terry. Why?

552
00:47:48,219 --> 00:47:50,931
Let's cut the bullshit.
I got to talk to you.

553
00:47:51,222 --> 00:47:55,685
Get your fucking hands off me.
Don't push me around in my club!

554
00:47:56,227 --> 00:47:59,940
-What the fuck are you doing?
-I told you to get out of here.

555
00:48:03,026 --> 00:48:04,569
You getting your rocks off?

556
00:48:04,777 --> 00:48:08,406
Is this what they teach you
to do when you're a cop? Shit!

557
00:48:08,698 --> 00:48:10,408
Have you seen your brother?

558
00:48:10,658 --> 00:48:14,037
No, I haven't.
I've told you a million times.

559
00:48:14,245 --> 00:48:16,372
What the flying fuck are you doing?

560
00:48:16,581 --> 00:48:18,249
Have you seen your brother?

561
00:48:18,583 --> 00:48:20,418
Are you stupid? I told you no.

562
00:48:20,961 --> 00:48:23,421
Why don't you just destroy my office?

563
00:48:23,671 --> 00:48:26,716
If you're looking for my lipstick,
it's in my bag.

564
00:48:31,387 --> 00:48:33,389
I've had enough of this.

565
00:48:35,308 --> 00:48:37,727
Look what I found. You got a gun.

566
00:48:37,935 --> 00:48:40,063
-I got a license for that.
-Where is it?

567
00:48:40,271 --> 00:48:41,439
My dog ate it.

568
00:48:41,814 --> 00:48:44,567
Let me tell you, this is a year in jail.

569
00:48:44,775 --> 00:48:46,777
You think a year's a piece of cake?

570
00:48:47,028 --> 00:48:49,072
-Aren't you smart.
-Look, it's getting late.

571
00:48:49,530 --> 00:48:54,285
All night I've been running
into people who are deaf, dumb and blind.

572
00:48:54,494 --> 00:48:57,205
So you know what? I'm gonna arrest you.

573
00:48:58,581 --> 00:49:00,333
You're gonna arrest me for what?

574
00:49:00,583 --> 00:49:01,584
How does it work?

575
00:49:01,876 --> 00:49:04,837
I give you a little head,
and you forget about it?

576
00:49:05,296 --> 00:49:07,798
I wouldn't forget.
You were never that good.

577
00:49:08,008 --> 00:49:10,051
Go fuck yourself.

578
00:49:10,301 --> 00:49:11,802
You're under arrest.

579
00:49:15,056 --> 00:49:17,225
I'm gonna need a new go-cart.

580
00:49:18,101 --> 00:49:20,020
Something with some stomp.

581
00:49:20,603 --> 00:49:21,812
And a scanner.

582
00:49:22,188 --> 00:49:25,650
Where the fuck are your manners?
The man's talking to you.

583
00:49:26,067 --> 00:49:27,818
CHAS: Hector! Hector....

584
00:49:28,986 --> 00:49:32,407
There's a GNX on the top floor,
in the parking garage.

585
00:49:32,615 --> 00:49:36,827
Bay 10. Take the scanner,
wire it and bring it back.

586
00:49:39,039 --> 00:49:42,042
We're going to have us a little party.

587
00:49:42,333 --> 00:49:44,752
A little party, a little soiree.

588
00:49:46,546 --> 00:49:50,758
Invite over a couple of chicks.
We can all get laid, get blowjobs.

589
00:49:51,717 --> 00:49:56,181
Hey, Richie, you know
I haven't gotten no pussy since 1969.

590
00:49:58,974 --> 00:50:03,604
No pussy since 1969? What've you
been doing? Jerking the gherkin?

591
00:50:05,356 --> 00:50:08,609
Come on, man. That's cold.
Leave him alone.

592
00:50:09,444 --> 00:50:11,237
What've you been doing?

593
00:50:14,907 --> 00:50:17,577
RICHIE: Hey, Bobby Arms! Get me a beer.

594
00:50:19,245 --> 00:50:21,206
You don't have to push me.

595
00:50:21,414 --> 00:50:26,127
Usually when you're arrested,
you can use a phone. You're kidding!

596
00:50:28,588 --> 00:50:31,591
You have not even told me
what I've been arrested for.

597
00:50:32,049 --> 00:50:34,510
Let me see here. What could we do?

598
00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:37,597
How about 240.25?

599
00:50:38,431 --> 00:50:40,725
-What's that?
-Prostitution, honey.

600
00:50:41,142 --> 00:50:42,643
Are you kidding me?

601
00:50:42,893 --> 00:50:44,395
Let me out now!

602
00:50:44,645 --> 00:50:46,731
I told you I was gonna do this.

603
00:50:47,732 --> 00:50:49,942
Are you out of your fucking mind?

604
00:50:50,235 --> 00:50:52,528
I told you I was not kidding.

605
00:50:52,778 --> 00:50:54,947
Now, how's your memory?

606
00:50:55,281 --> 00:50:56,491
Who is Roxanne?

607
00:50:57,074 --> 00:50:59,202
You're starting to piss me off.

608
00:50:59,910 --> 00:51:02,163
Did you ever find this one on the street?

609
00:51:02,413 --> 00:51:04,207
-Many times.
-How much was she?

610
00:51:04,415 --> 00:51:07,168
-DETECTIVE: Ten bucks.
-Ten bucks this, friend.

611
00:51:07,418 --> 00:51:09,920
Fuck you!
I can't believe you're doing this.

612
00:51:10,130 --> 00:51:13,424
I'm disappointed.
I thought you could get at least 15.

613
00:51:15,468 --> 00:51:18,971
PATTI: Gino, you fuck! Get me out of here!

614
00:51:25,603 --> 00:51:27,855
-JOEY: Chas, have another drink.
-All right.

615
00:51:35,321 --> 00:51:38,324
Richie, what's the story
with you and that cop?

616
00:51:40,868 --> 00:51:42,828
Who? Gino?

617
00:51:43,454 --> 00:51:44,539
No.

618
00:51:44,872 --> 00:51:48,042
The one you popped. Was that business?

619
00:51:48,376 --> 00:51:50,170
Or was it personal?

620
00:51:53,756 --> 00:51:55,341
It was personal business.

621
00:52:01,096 --> 00:52:02,307
Holy shit!

622
00:52:02,515 --> 00:52:04,809
Why are you asking me about my business?

623
00:52:05,059 --> 00:52:07,019
Richie, cops! Cops!

624
00:52:07,645 --> 00:52:10,105
-You rat me out?
-No, never.

625
00:52:10,398 --> 00:52:11,399
You rat bastard!

626
00:52:11,649 --> 00:52:13,234
I'd never rat you out.

627
00:52:14,485 --> 00:52:17,572
-I'll put you out of your misery.
-Please, don't!

628
00:52:26,789 --> 00:52:29,166
-COPS: Get your hands up!
-Nobody move!

629
00:52:30,293 --> 00:52:34,129
BOCHI: Why did you have to shoot him?
He didn't rat us out.

630
00:53:34,231 --> 00:53:35,232
GINO: How you doing?

631
00:53:35,483 --> 00:53:38,819
You arrest Patricia because
she no help you find Richard.

632
00:53:39,069 --> 00:53:42,782
Yeah, but just the same,
maybe we could talk a minute.

633
00:53:47,077 --> 00:53:49,580
You sit down right over here.

634
00:54:01,426 --> 00:54:03,636
This is difficult for me to say.

635
00:54:04,261 --> 00:54:06,889
I'm sorry for the way
I behaved in your home.

636
00:54:07,097 --> 00:54:11,101
It was disrespectful.
You've always been like a father to me.

637
00:54:12,144 --> 00:54:13,938
If you tell me

638
00:54:14,689 --> 00:54:18,192
that you haven't seen Richie,
I believe you. We got problems.

639
00:54:19,610 --> 00:54:21,111
I....

640
00:54:22,780 --> 00:54:24,490
I know that it's...

641
00:54:24,782 --> 00:54:27,117
No man wants to bury his son.

642
00:54:29,119 --> 00:54:30,371
And I know

643
00:54:30,913 --> 00:54:33,290
no man wants to admit that his son

644
00:54:33,499 --> 00:54:35,960
has become something
the world can do without.

645
00:54:38,128 --> 00:54:39,630
But I'm very afraid

646
00:54:40,965 --> 00:54:43,968
every moment for everyone around us.

647
00:54:46,136 --> 00:54:47,555
I pray

648
00:54:48,348 --> 00:54:50,057
for this to end.

649
00:54:52,560 --> 00:54:54,770
I know what you're trying to say.

650
00:55:06,782 --> 00:55:11,662
I'm gonna have to
make you stay downtown tonight.

651
00:55:28,178 --> 00:55:31,306
Jerry, that's robbery, not narcotics.

652
00:55:32,224 --> 00:55:35,436
Talk to Donziger and get back to me.

653
00:55:35,811 --> 00:55:37,438
I'll talk to you.

654
00:55:54,705 --> 00:55:56,791
Does this look familiar?

655
00:56:05,257 --> 00:56:07,092
I help you, he'll kill me.

656
00:56:07,427 --> 00:56:09,094
He's your own brother!

657
00:56:09,303 --> 00:56:12,723
He's a vacuum.
He sucks up three to four grams a pass.

658
00:56:12,890 --> 00:56:15,350
That doesn't promote rational thought.

659
00:56:16,268 --> 00:56:20,523
It'll get worse. I been telling you.
I got your father under arrest.

660
00:56:20,731 --> 00:56:22,650
It won't work, Gino!

661
00:56:22,900 --> 00:56:25,152
God, why don't you understand this?

662
00:56:26,487 --> 00:56:28,238
We can't help you.

663
00:56:28,448 --> 00:56:31,826
-If he thinks we did, he'll kill Pop.
-He's that far gone?

664
00:56:32,076 --> 00:56:33,786
Believe it, Gino.

665
00:56:34,369 --> 00:56:35,788
Anybody.

666
00:56:36,288 --> 00:56:39,500
Then I'm gonna keep you here
tonight and keep you alive.

667
00:56:39,750 --> 00:56:41,251
Hate me tomorrow.

668
00:56:48,801 --> 00:56:50,385
ANGIE: In the 8-0 precinct.

669
00:56:50,678 --> 00:56:55,265
Signal 1013. Police officer shot.
6835 Amboy Street.

670
00:56:55,766 --> 00:56:59,812
This is one night this town
ain't ever gonna forget about.

671
00:57:00,020 --> 00:57:02,815
Ask me, I think you already
made sure of that.

672
00:57:03,065 --> 00:57:07,027
ANGIE: Gino, your wife called.
She's at your apartment with Tony.

673
00:57:07,277 --> 00:57:10,197
Any chance you can
swing over there for a minute?

674
00:57:11,448 --> 00:57:14,368
GINO: I could do that.
I'm right in the area.

675
00:57:16,328 --> 00:57:18,998
Come here. Come over here.

676
00:57:22,793 --> 00:57:26,213
I almost forgot about you.

677
00:57:26,631 --> 00:57:30,384
I gotta get you
a nice hot bath, some food.

678
00:57:30,843 --> 00:57:33,471
Maybe a girlfriend or something.

679
00:57:51,906 --> 00:57:53,658
-Hi.
-Hi.

680
00:57:57,161 --> 00:57:59,329
-How's Tony?
-He's fine.

681
00:58:02,082 --> 00:58:03,375
Have you eaten anything?

682
00:58:03,668 --> 00:58:05,878
A couple of dog biscuits.

683
00:58:06,211 --> 00:58:08,088
GINO: My new dog.
VICKY: Look at you.

684
00:58:09,464 --> 00:58:12,134
-A police dog?
-This is Coraggio.

685
00:58:13,010 --> 00:58:14,136
You gonna keep him?

686
00:58:14,344 --> 00:58:16,055
I'm thinking about it.

687
00:58:17,181 --> 00:58:19,850
Maybe. It depends on how brave he is.

688
00:58:22,436 --> 00:58:24,271
I better go and see Tony.

689
00:58:28,693 --> 00:58:30,861
You want to come up for an espresso?

690
00:58:31,111 --> 00:58:33,531
Yeah. Why not?

691
00:58:34,448 --> 00:58:36,742
GINO: You stay there and be a good boy.

692
00:58:40,370 --> 00:58:44,709
-GINO: Should we show the dog to Tony?
-He'll never go back to sleep.

693
00:58:44,917 --> 00:58:46,669
VICKY: Did you ever have a dog?

694
00:58:46,919 --> 00:58:51,090
GINO: Are you kidding? We didn't have
enough money to feed ourselves.

695
00:58:51,381 --> 00:58:55,720
There was this old man who came
to the neighborhood when we were kids.

696
00:58:56,511 --> 00:58:58,639
He was from the old country.

697
00:58:59,139 --> 00:59:01,391
Carried an old school bell.

698
00:59:01,642 --> 00:59:06,564
He'd pull along this little sharpening
machine operated by a foot peddle.

699
00:59:07,815 --> 00:59:12,653
The neighbors used to come get
their knives and scissors sharpened.

700
00:59:12,903 --> 00:59:14,905
A dime here, a quarter there.

701
00:59:15,405 --> 00:59:17,407
But it was an honest living.

702
00:59:17,742 --> 00:59:19,284
Time goes on,

703
00:59:19,534 --> 00:59:21,245
people start buying

704
00:59:21,495 --> 00:59:24,248
disposable scissors and knives.

705
00:59:24,915 --> 00:59:27,001
Fewer and fewer people come out.

706
00:59:27,501 --> 00:59:29,336
I always used to think

707
00:59:29,795 --> 00:59:31,839
how it would feel to leave

708
00:59:32,089 --> 00:59:33,841
before light

709
00:59:34,299 --> 00:59:36,176
and come back after dark

710
00:59:36,426 --> 00:59:40,765
with nothing to show your wife and family
for what you've done.

711
00:59:43,517 --> 00:59:47,312
That bell was the loneliest
sound I ever heard.

712
00:59:49,523 --> 00:59:51,233
He was your father?

713
00:59:53,986 --> 00:59:57,657
I remember one time I followed
the old man for a whole summer,

714
00:59:57,948 --> 00:59:59,158
every day,

715
00:59:59,449 --> 01:00:00,951
day in, day out.

716
01:00:03,245 --> 01:00:07,291
And after a while,
it started to grind him down.

717
01:00:08,542 --> 01:00:11,629
Nobody. Nobody needs him, you know?

718
01:00:12,296 --> 01:00:14,757
You feel like nobody needs you,

719
01:00:15,549 --> 01:00:17,467
and you feel useless,

720
01:00:21,847 --> 01:00:23,724
you die inside.

721
01:00:27,102 --> 01:00:28,979
You let yourself go.

722
01:00:30,314 --> 01:00:33,984
We always used to tell everybody,
"Pop died from cancer."

723
01:00:34,694 --> 01:00:36,862
I believe he died of a broken heart.

724
01:00:38,113 --> 01:00:39,865
After Pop died,

725
01:00:41,408 --> 01:00:45,204
and the neighborhood kids
wanted to go to Coney Island to play,

726
01:00:46,538 --> 01:00:49,208
one of the other fathers, Mr. Madano,

727
01:00:49,499 --> 01:00:53,337
used to slip me a little money
so I could play with the kids too.

728
01:01:00,886 --> 01:01:05,432
You want to know how I repay Mr. Madano,
how I thanked him tonight?

729
01:01:06,433 --> 01:01:07,727
I arrested him.

730
01:01:08,518 --> 01:01:10,520
Just so I could get to Richie.

731
01:01:12,189 --> 01:01:14,149
That's how crazy I get.

732
01:01:15,650 --> 01:01:19,654
Gino, these may be your streets
and your neighborhood,

733
01:01:21,073 --> 01:01:22,825
but there are other cops.

734
01:01:24,576 --> 01:01:26,578
I'm really proud of what you do.

735
01:01:29,206 --> 01:01:31,541
And I know how everybody loves you.

736
01:01:32,417 --> 01:01:34,461
But Tony needs a father,

737
01:01:35,337 --> 01:01:37,047
and I need a husband.

738
01:01:39,884 --> 01:01:42,970
Are we talking reconciliation over here?

739
01:01:43,303 --> 01:01:45,931
No, we're talking a lifetime deal.

740
01:01:46,640 --> 01:01:48,225
All or nothing.

741
01:01:50,936 --> 01:01:52,271
I could do that.

742
01:01:52,897 --> 01:01:54,398
That I could do.

743
01:02:07,745 --> 01:02:09,079
I love you.

744

You'd shoot an unarmed man?

I wouldn't. You know what I'm gonna do?

01:06:29,839 --> 01:06:32,509
-Why not?
-Who's Richie to you, anyway?

791
01:06:32,884 --> 01:06:34,469
A piece of shit.

792
01:06:35,679 --> 01:06:37,472
So how come you been crying?

793
01:06:39,183 --> 01:06:40,934
I got a fucking migraine.

794
01:06:43,645 --> 01:06:45,897
Listen, I want to ask you something.

795
01:06:46,773 --> 01:06:47,857
Do you know this girl?

796
01:06:53,572 --> 01:06:55,740
Maybe you could sit over here.

797
01:06:56,950 --> 01:06:58,118
You all right?

798
01:07:00,204 --> 01:07:01,246
Come on, Terry.

799
01:07:03,790 --> 01:07:05,375
You have to talk to me.

800
01:07:09,003 --> 01:07:10,380
Who is it?

801
01:07:10,589 --> 01:07:12,299
It's Roxanne.

802
01:07:14,259 --> 01:07:16,386
And you were fucking Bobby
at the same time?

803
01:07:16,761 --> 01:07:19,681
Don't be that way. Come on. Settle down.

804
01:07:25,019 --> 01:07:26,230
She got a last name?

805
01:07:26,771 --> 01:07:28,523
Ford. Roxanne Ford.

806
01:08:08,188 --> 01:08:09,856
RICHIE: How you doing, Vermeer?

807
01:08:11,858 --> 01:08:15,112
How the hell did you get up here?
Jesus Christ!

808
01:08:17,781 --> 01:08:19,949
He didn't have nothing to do with it.

809
01:08:31,461 --> 01:08:36,466
Where you been?
We been waiting here all night for you.

810
01:08:41,221 --> 01:08:43,140
RICHIE: What you been waiting on?

811
01:08:44,891 --> 01:08:45,975
What?

812
01:08:46,518 --> 01:08:48,395
Waiting on if you need us.

813
01:08:48,603 --> 01:08:50,189
What happened to your nose?

814
01:08:51,105 --> 01:08:52,441
What happened to your nose?

815
01:08:52,524 --> 01:08:56,027
Gino came around, playing the role.
Busting up the place.

816
01:08:56,320 --> 01:08:58,112
RICHIE: What, you ain't got a piece?

817
01:09:00,574 --> 01:09:02,492
RICHIE: You got a piece behind the bar.

818
01:09:02,867 --> 01:09:05,870
You let him do that to your face?
Why didn't you whack him?

819
01:09:06,205 --> 01:09:09,499
All I heard was you clipped Bobby.
Now I gotta whack a cop too?

820
01:09:10,750 --> 01:09:13,795
Nobody has to worry about you
stepping on your dick.

821
01:09:16,923 --> 01:09:21,135
You know how wacko he gets!
And with you doing Bobby like that!

822
01:09:21,678 --> 01:09:26,057
You're mistaking me
for someone that gives a shit.

823
01:09:26,641 --> 01:09:30,437
If Gino and me bang heads,
he'll be racked in a closed casket.

824
01:09:32,772 --> 01:09:35,442
TATTOO: You saying
you won't let him take you?

825
01:09:36,109 --> 01:09:37,527
What are you, a clown?

826
01:09:39,446 --> 01:09:41,781
Take me? Take me where?

827
01:09:49,539 --> 01:09:51,833
You let one motherfucker take you!

828
01:09:52,083 --> 01:09:56,963
It ain't just Gino. Bulls are banging
doors all over the neighborhood.

829
01:09:58,172 --> 01:09:59,799
Frankie's guys are back!

830
01:10:00,049 --> 01:10:04,596
Them too! Every couple of hours
a different bunch comes slapping me.

831
01:10:04,846 --> 01:10:07,391
RICHIE: Stop whining
like a cunt and get your piece.

832
01:10:13,772 --> 01:10:14,773
I can't.

833
01:10:17,651 --> 01:10:19,611
Don't let me see you again.

834
01:10:21,446 --> 01:10:24,491
Don't ever fucking let me see you again.

835
01:10:31,581 --> 01:10:34,251
Good evening, fellas.
Nice to see you again.

836
01:10:35,377 --> 01:10:37,921
Never mind the bullshit.
Where the fuck is he?

837
01:10:38,422 --> 01:10:39,423
Over here, Sal.

838
01:10:56,022 --> 01:10:57,399
You lose.

839
01:12:21,941 --> 01:12:23,276
RONNY: Who's she?

840
01:12:24,861 --> 01:12:28,490
She brought me to the girlfriend.
She just identified the body,

841
01:12:28,698 --> 01:12:31,034
so she's a little upset.

842
01:12:31,576 --> 01:12:34,203
-Did you have breakfast this morning?
-Yeah.

843
01:12:35,079 --> 01:12:37,206
Good. Because it ain't pretty.

844
01:12:48,718 --> 01:12:52,221
-What is it?
-They killed Allie and three of the guys.

845
01:12:53,347 --> 01:12:54,974
It's no good.

846
01:12:55,392 --> 01:12:56,393
FRANKIE: Let's find Richie.

847
01:12:59,646 --> 01:13:03,483
O'Kelly, get upstairs
and make them photograph that thing right.

848
01:13:03,733 --> 01:13:05,234
O'KELLY: You got it.

849
01:13:10,239 --> 01:13:13,242
This is what I found in Bobby's desk.

850
01:13:14,160 --> 01:13:18,582
Bobby was doing this one
and the one in the car at the same time.

851
01:13:18,957 --> 01:13:23,169
From the extreme rigor mortis
in the body, it looks like

852
01:13:23,377 --> 01:13:26,756
time of death, 24 hours ago.
Before Bobby.

853
01:13:29,050 --> 01:13:31,177
I'm getting too old for this shit.

854
01:13:31,385 --> 01:13:32,971
GINO: I know what you mean.

855
01:13:55,452 --> 01:13:56,453
RICHIE: Rica!

856
01:13:57,662 --> 01:13:58,913
Rica!

857
01:13:59,789 --> 01:14:01,958
RICA: Keep it down. My sister's sleeping.

858
01:14:02,166 --> 01:14:06,170
Wake her up.
We ain't disturbing you, are we?

859
01:14:06,838 --> 01:14:08,507
Rica, come here.

860
01:14:09,007 --> 01:14:10,842
We're wanting a little party.

861
01:14:13,302 --> 01:14:14,929
I want a little party.

862
01:14:15,179 --> 01:14:17,807
Kind of my going-away party. Right, Bobby?

863
01:14:17,974 --> 01:14:19,433
Right, Rich.

864
01:14:19,684 --> 01:14:22,311
You ain't got a problem with that, do you?

865
01:14:22,479 --> 01:14:23,938
No, Rich. No problem.

866
01:14:33,865 --> 01:14:35,950
Angie? Get me Gino. It's Picolino.

867
01:14:36,242 --> 01:14:40,204
Call up Willy the Pimp.
Have him send over his best broads.

868
01:14:40,413 --> 01:14:43,500
Nobody will say you hung out with me
just for the money.

869
01:14:50,131 --> 01:14:51,841
Richie, please. Come on.

870
01:14:55,011 --> 01:14:57,096
I'll take care of you.

871
01:14:57,346 --> 01:14:59,098
I'll take care of you.

872
01:15:01,475 --> 01:15:02,519
Hey, boys!

873
01:15:03,562 --> 01:15:06,272
We're gonna have us a good time tonight.

874
01:15:06,606 --> 01:15:08,900
ARMS: Bigtime, Richie. Bigtime.

875
01:15:09,150 --> 01:15:12,236
RICHIE: It's my night! My last night!

(KNOCK ON DOOR)

877
01:15:17,867 --> 01:15:19,035
Who is it?

878
01:15:19,619 --> 01:15:21,412
GINO: Gino.

879
01:15:24,165 --> 01:15:25,584
Oh, Gino!

880
01:15:29,212 --> 01:15:30,296
GINO: How you doing, Laura?

881
01:15:30,547 --> 01:15:33,382
Good. Okay.
I couldn't sleep after Vick left.

882
01:15:33,592 --> 01:15:36,177
So I had a bath. I'm better now.

883
01:15:46,813 --> 01:15:48,522
What are you doing?

884
01:15:48,815 --> 01:15:50,609
LAURIE: What are you looking for?

885
01:15:51,901 --> 01:15:54,195
No! No, Gino, that's my purse.

886
01:15:54,445 --> 01:15:56,615
Give me that. Gino, stop!

887
01:16:03,496 --> 01:16:04,497
What's this?

888
01:16:06,750 --> 01:16:08,126
What is this?

889
01:16:08,334 --> 01:16:11,295
Is this what Richie
threw on Bobby after he shot him?

890
01:16:12,463 --> 01:16:13,757
That was fast thinking.

891
01:16:14,340 --> 01:16:16,509
Just like a good cop's wife would.

892
01:16:16,718 --> 01:16:17,719
No.

893
01:16:18,637 --> 01:16:20,054
GINO: You know what I think?

894
01:16:20,263 --> 01:16:22,431
I think you found this somewhere

895
01:16:22,599 --> 01:16:24,976
and got so mad
you couldn't see straight.

896
01:16:25,268 --> 01:16:30,439
And you sent one to Richie, never dreaming
he might actually kill Bobby.

897
01:16:30,732 --> 01:16:32,150
No....

898
01:16:32,441 --> 01:16:35,111
I took it because I wanted to protect him.

899
01:16:36,154 --> 01:16:38,657
See, this is Roxanne, here.

900
01:16:39,073 --> 01:16:43,036
Twenty-four years old.
Richie killed her first.

901
01:16:43,244 --> 01:16:45,329
No. You got it all wrong.

902
01:16:45,830 --> 01:16:48,708
I only took it so people wouldn't know.

903
01:16:48,958 --> 01:16:50,459
Bobby was dirty, wasn't he?

904
01:16:51,294 --> 01:16:52,796
Or maybe

905
01:16:53,087 --> 01:16:56,299
he was just doing Richie's girlfriend
at the same time.

906
01:16:56,590 --> 01:16:57,967
I don't think so.

907
01:16:58,760 --> 01:17:02,555
I think Bobby always wanted
to be like somebody else.

908
01:17:02,764 --> 01:17:07,143
He liked Richie's lifestyle, his money.
And you knew he was dirty.

909
01:17:07,644 --> 01:17:10,063
Bobby's gone now. So are lots of others.

910
01:17:10,271 --> 01:17:12,481
I didn't want to kill him.

911
01:17:12,732 --> 01:17:15,276
I just wanted to save my marriage.

912
01:17:15,735 --> 01:17:17,278
Come here, Laura.

913
01:17:19,405 --> 01:17:21,991
I want my Bobby back.

914
01:17:22,366 --> 01:17:24,077
I want him back.

me and you alone sometime?

951
01:25:38,612 --> 01:25:40,989
GINO: I won't even bring my beeper.

952
01:25:41,699 --> 01:25:44,034
Speaking of food, I could go for

953
01:25:44,368 --> 01:25:47,913
a chili hot dog with
cheese and French fries.

954
01:25:48,164 --> 01:25:52,501
Not for nothing. It's 9:00 a.m.
Eat here, you'll have gangrene by noon.

955
01:25:53,377 --> 01:25:56,297
I'm going to buy you a nice romantic...

956
01:26:03,804 --> 01:26:05,097
Yo, fucknuts!

957
01:26:07,099 --> 01:26:08,559
You talking to me?

958
01:26:08,767 --> 01:26:12,563
You the guy who threw a puppy
out of the car the other day?

959
01:26:12,813 --> 01:26:16,024
-What's your business, anyway?
-I'm an animal lover.

960
01:26:16,275 --> 01:26:17,526
-Animal lover?
-Yeah.

961
01:26:18,402 --> 01:26:21,864
You don't mind your business,
I'll stuff you in a bag

962
01:26:22,072 --> 01:26:23,949
and throw you out a window.

963
01:26:24,200 --> 01:26:27,745
-You a tough guy?
-I'll show you how tough I am.

964
01:26:34,335 --> 01:26:36,044
My balls!

965
01:26:44,803 --> 01:26:46,889
(DOG URINATING)

966
01:26:50,476 --> 01:26:54,563
GINO: Oh, Vick, look over here!
Is that a police dog, or what?
