00:00:26,493 --> 00:00:31,393
片名：海防最前线

2
00:00:42,209 --> 00:00:46,043
有个传说，说海水下住了个人
There's a legend of a man who lives beneath the sea.

3
00:00:46,113 --> 00:00:48,013
他是捞人的
He is a fisher of men,

4
00:00:48,315 --> 00:00:51,978
是落伍者的最后希望
the last hope of all those who have been left behind.

5
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:55,579
很多逃生者声称，他们感觉到他的手托在自己身下
Many survivors claim to have felt his gripping hands beneath them,

6
00:00:55,655 --> 00:00:57,589
把自己推上了海面
pushing them up to the surface,

7
00:00:57,657 --> 00:01:00,820
低声鼓励他们，直到救援赶来
whispering strength until help could arrive.

8
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:04,227
但这，当然，只是个传说
But this, of course, is only a legend.

9
00:01:08,168 --> 00:01:09,567

13
00:01:18,345 --> 00:01:21,280

Ma'am, I'm a Coast Guard rescue swimmer.

14
00:01:21,348 --> 00:01:22,872
我是来救你的

15
00:01:24,151 --> 00:01:28,554
先生，和你的浮标待在一起 我会回来接你的
Sir, stay with your flotation. I'll be back for you.

16
00:01:28,622 --> 00:01:30,681
- 别丢下我  - 待在那
- Don't leave me!  - Just stay there.

17
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:32,816
别丢下我
Don't you leave me!

18
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:38,691
救生篮已经在舱外，正在吊下
Basket is outside the cabin door and going down.

19
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:39,789
收到
Roger. Copy you.

20
00:01:39,866 --> 00:01:42,801
右前方30尺 右前方15尺
Forward and right 30. Forward and right 15.

21
00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:43,858
右前15尺
Right 15.

22
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:44,926
停，停
Ho, ho, ho!

23
00:01:45,739 --> 00:01:47,900
救生篮入水了
Basket is in the water.

24
00:01:47,974 --> 00:01:49,942
救生员和生还者已经在篮内了
Swimmer and survivor are at the basket.

25
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:51,875
让你的头先进去
Put your head in first.

26
00:01:55,515 --> 00:01:56,914
我得出去
I gotta get out!

27
00:01:56,983 --> 00:01:58,211
慢点，向前
Easy, forward.

28
00:01:59,052 --> 00:02:01,748
放开，放开
Let go! Let go.

29
00:02:01,988 --> 00:02:04,422
放开，你会淹死她的
Let go. You're drowning her!

30
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:11,654
救生员给了他脸上一拳
Swimmer just popped him in the face.

31
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:17,695
他把男人放进篮里了
Okay, he's putting the man in the basket.

32
00:02:17,771 --> 00:02:19,568
男人进篮了
The man is in the basket.

33
00:02:19,873 --> 00:02:21,773
我们要把他拉上来
We're taking the load.

34
00:02:26,546 --> 00:02:27,843
哇，大浪来袭
Whoa, big wave.

35
00:02:33,253 --> 00:02:35,380
出去，出去，你有毛病啊？
Get out! Get out! What's wrong with you?

36
00:02:35,455 --> 00:02:37,116
坐好，闭嘴
Sit there and shut up.

37
00:02:56,977 --> 00:02:58,137
看到救生员了
Swimmer in sight.

38
00:03:02,482 --> 00:03:04,245
准备拉起
Prepare to take the load.

39
00:03:04,317 --> 00:03:06,308
我看到“可以拉起”的信号了
I have the ready-for-pickup signal.

40
00:03:14,761 --> 00:03:17,355
救生员靠近舱门了
Swimmer is approaching cabin door.

41
00:03:17,964 --> 00:03:19,932
生还者看来失去了意识

42
00:03:21,601 --> 00:03:23,694
救生员在舱内了
Swimmer inside the cabin door.

43
00:03:25,839 --> 00:03:28,034
关上舱门
Cabin door closing.

44
00:03:42,289 --> 00:03:43,984
我想你打断了我的鼻子
I think you just broke my nose.

45
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:46,719
而你可能杀了你太太，先生
And you may have killed your wife, sir.

46
00:03:48,628 --> 00:03:49,959
20分钟到科迪亚克
Twenty minutes to Kodiak.

47
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:52,794
收到，他正在对她进行心肺复苏
Roger. He's giving her CPR.

48
00:03:52,966 --> 00:03:55,662
科迪亚克中心，这是海岸警卫队6096号
Comstate Kodiak, this is Coast Guard 6096.

49
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:58,363
舱内载有两名低体温生还者

请求派救护车到降落地点
Requesting to have an ambulance on-scene when we land.

52

53
00:04:25,031 --> 00:04:26,658
- 救活她了？  - 救活她了
Got her?  - Got her!

54
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:44,974
出发啦，伙计
Attaway, baby.

55
00:04:46,252 --> 00:04:47,651
只有死透了…
There's dead,

56
00:04:50,924 --> 00:04:52,585
才算是死
then there's dead.

57
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,121
我发誓，你年岁越大越棒了
I swear, you get better with age.

58
00:05:23,256 --> 00:05:25,554
- 不得不打他，啊？  - 是啊
- Had to hit him, huh?  - Yeah.

59
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:28,923
你不是，待在那，待那
You are not. You stay over there! You stay over there!

60
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:33,990
似乎总是强者失控啊
Seems like it's always the big ones that crack.

61
00:05:36,069 --> 00:05:37,161
中尉
Lieutenant.

62
00:05:37,237 --> 00:05:40,900
组员说她沉到水里了 他们以为你救不活她呢
Crew said that she went under. They thought you'd lost her.

63
00:05:41,307 --> 00:05:43,366
幸运吧我猜
Lucky guess.

64
00:05:44,544 --> 00:05:46,409
幸个屁运
Luck, my ass.

65
00:06:07,967 --> 00:06:10,800
- 我不认为你是来真的  - 你当然不了，本
- I didn't think you were serious.  - Of course you didn't, Ben.

66
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,531
你怎么会认为我来真的呢
How could you possibly think I was serious?

67
00:06:12,605 --> 00:06:14,800
我又不是哪个无名的溺水者
I'm not some nameless drowning victim.

68
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:18,810
哦，天，我很抱歉 救人和我们的社交有冲突
Oh, gee, I'm sorry saving lives doesn't jive with our social...

69
00:06:20,313 --> 00:06:21,302
那
That's...

70
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:24,576
那是我的椅子
That's my chair.

71
00:06:24,651 --> 00:06:26,710
他说的对，不是那把椅子
Oh, he's right. Not that chair.

72
00:06:27,754 --> 00:06:32,453
对不起，我只是在客厅指了一下 他不知道
I'm sorry. I was just pointing things out in the living room. He didn't know.

73
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:35,323
我不会拿你的椅子的
I would never take your chair.

74
00:06:42,602 --> 00:06:44,365
搬上去，行吗？
Pick it up, would...

75
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,969
没什么难的，本
Doesn't have to be messy, Ben.

76
00:06:49,042 --> 00:06:52,478
这样简单清楚，对我们双方都是 我们没有孩子
It's clean, simple for both of us. We don't have kids.

77
00:06:55,682 --> 00:06:57,650
那，周五怎么办？
Well, what about Friday?

78
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,417
什么周五怎么办？
What about Friday?

79
00:07:01,488 --> 00:07:03,922
我们要去卡尔和布雷吉特那的
We were gonna go with Carl and Bridget, you know,

80
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:07,357
那个基地的晚餐舞会
to that dinner-dance thing at the base.

81
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:11,488
基地？“鸡翅随意吃”？
The base? All-you-can-eat wings?

82
00:07:11,564 --> 00:07:15,159
投飞镖付帐单 这就是我们不能错过的日子？
A dart game to settle the tab? That's the date that we can't break?

83
00:07:15,235 --> 00:07:17,328
- 你是对的，你是对的  - 哇
- You're right. You're right.  - Wow.

84
00:07:17,403 --> 00:07:21,635
听我说，我们离开，好吗？就我们俩
Look, we'll... We'll go away, all right? Just us.

85
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:23,435
太晚了，本
It's too late, Ben.

86
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:26,308
我不知道我还有什么没说过的能对你说
I don't know what I can say to you that I haven't said already.

87
00:07:26,379 --> 00:07:28,813
是时候挽救我自己了
95 It's time for me to rescue myself.

88
00:07:36,189 --> 00:07:38,953
可能是我该搬出去
Maybe... Maybe I should be the one to move out.

89
00:07:39,025 --> 00:07:40,117
嗨，这是海伦

你甚至不知道这房里的东西在哪
You don't even know where anything is in this house.

93
00:07:44,697 --> 00:07:45,857
还是这样简单的多

94
00:07:45,932 --> 00:07:48,400

本，我们这样的讨论有多少回了
Ben, how many times have we had this conversation?

106
00:08:39,085 --> 00:08:43,112
你唯一的办法就是放弃，去做文职
The only way for you to save it is to give this up and fly a desk.

107
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:46,821
没错，她只是想过日子
Exactly. She just wants to live.

108
00:08:48,494 --> 00:08:51,327
说不定我们能找个兴趣活动 我们都有兴趣的

我们这样的人不钓鱼，卡尔

112
00:08:58,004 --> 00:09:00,165
这会有用的，一向有用
It'll work out. Always does.

113
00:09:01,674 --> 00:09:05,667
我问你个问题吧，说真的 我现在约她出去是不是太快了？
Let me ask you something, seriously. Is it too soon for me to ask her out?

114
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:07,175
大概吧
I guess so.

115
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:12,150
求救！求救！求救！
Mayday! Mayday! Mayday!

- All right, take the stick.  - Okay, I have the controls.

00:21:57,883 --> 00:21:59,612
快点，行动
Hurry up. Move it out.

265
00:21:59,685 --> 00:22:01,812
找好你们的床位，别耽误我时间
Find your rack. Quit wasting my time.

266
00:22:01,887 --> 00:22:05,186
嘿，嘿，那是我的东西，老兄
Hey. Hey! That's my stuff, man.

267
00:22:05,424 --> 00:22:07,585
嘿，那是他的床位
Hey, that's his bunk.

268
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:09,955
你们是一对吗？
You two a couple?

269
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:14,824
算了，反正我更喜欢上铺
It's okay. I like the top better anyway.

270
00:22:17,269 --> 00:22:18,930
三万九千名男女
Out of the 39,000 men and women

271
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:20,835
构成了美国海岸警卫队
who make up the United States Coast Guard,

272
00:22:20,906 --> 00:22:23,841
其中只有280名救生员
there are only 280 rescue swimmers.

273
00:22:23,909 --> 00:22:25,240
快点，快点，美人鱼们
Let's go! Let's go, mermaids!

274
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:27,301
这是因为我们是海岸警卫队的精英
This is because we are the Coast Guard's elite.

275
00:22:27,379 --> 00:22:29,244
我们是优中选优
We are the best of the best.

276
00:22:29,314 --> 00:22:32,647
当港口因为风暴而关闭时，我们行动
When storms shut down entire ports, we go out.

277
00:22:33,118 --> 00:22:36,576
当飓风把美国海军封在岸上时，我们行动
When hurricanes ground the United States Navy, we go out.

278
00:22:36,655 --> 00:22:39,249
当天主亲自从天堂降临
And when the holy Lord himself reaches down from heaven

279
00:22:39,324 --> 00:22:43,260
摧毁k创造的世界，用风把房屋连根拔起时
and destroys his good work with winds that rip houses off the ground,

280
00:22:43,562 --> 00:22:45,427
我们行动
we go out.

281
00:22:46,398 --> 00:22:50,027
这所学校的淘汰率大大超过50％
And the attrition rate at this school is well over 50%.

282
00:22:50,102 --> 00:22:54,766
所以要是奇迹出现 你真的有资格成为我们中的一员
So if by some miracle you actually have what it takes to become one of us,

283
00:22:55,441 --> 00:22:59,275
那你一生将只拿微薄的薪水
then you get to live a life of meager pay

284
00:22:59,344 --> 00:23:03,474
有很大可能你生命将这样终结 无人相伴，唯有寒冷，慢慢离世
with the distinct possibility of dying slow, cold and alone

285
00:23:03,849 --> 00:23:05,373
陷于茫茫大海之中
somewhere in the vast sea.

286
00:23:06,485 --> 00:23:09,852
但是，你也将获得机会拯救生命
However, you also get the chance to save lives,

287
00:23:10,789 --> 00:23:14,190
而世上再没有比这更好的职业了
and there is no greater calling in the world than that.

288
00:23:14,259 --> 00:23:18,662
那么，女士们先生们，欢迎来到“A”校
So, ladies and gentlemen, welcome. Welcome to "A" School.

289
00:23:19,264 --> 00:23:21,289
有什么问题吗？
Are there any questions?

290
00:23:23,035 --> 00:23:26,436
上校，我是空军士兵费舍尔 只有一个问题
Captain, Airman Fischer. Just have one question.

291
00:23:27,272 --> 00:23:30,730
那个保持所有记录的家伙，他还活着吗？
That guy who holds all them records, is he still alive?

292
00:23:31,009 --> 00:23:32,237
为什么要问
Why do you ask?

293
00:23:32,311 --> 00:23:33,835
我只是想你应该让他知道
I just thought you ought to let him know

294
00:23:33,912 --> 00:23:35,675
我想要让他名字从那块板上消失
I'm about to knock his name off that board.

295
00:23:35,747 --> 00:23:38,147
真的吗？你干嘛不自己告诉他呢？
Really? Why don't you let him know yourself?

296
00:23:38,217 --> 00:23:41,675
他就站在你身后，在屋子后面
He's standing right behind you in the back of the room.

297
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:45,456
全班都有，向后转 向二级军士长本・朗道致敬
Class, turn around and greet Senior Chief Ben Randall.

298
00:23:46,391 --> 00:23:50,987
二级军士长朗道将在未来18星期中 作你们的班主任
Senior Chief Randall will be your lead instructor for the next 18 weeks.

299
00:23:51,063 --> 00:23:57,860
二级军士长朗道是美国海岸警卫队历史上最出色的救生员之一
Senior Chief Randall is one of the most decorated rescue swimmers
in the history of the United States Coast Guard.

300
00:23:59,438 --> 00:24:02,066
本，你愿意向全班致词吗？
Ben, would you care to address the class?

301
00:24:02,141 --> 00:24:05,076
不，我觉得一天说这么多已经够了
No, I think there's been enough talk for one day.

302
00:24:05,144 --> 00:24:07,806
二级军士长，他们归你管了
Chief Skinner, they're all yours.

303
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:09,780
全体立正
Attention on deck.

304
00:24:09,848 --> 00:24:11,782
- 稍息  - 是，上校
- Carry on.  - Aye, Captain.

305
00:24:13,085 --> 00:24:15,883
体力测试，明早七点开始
PT test begins at 0700 tomorrow.

306
00:24:15,954 --> 00:24:18,184
全班解散，从前门出去
Class dismissed. You will file through the front door.

307
00:24:18,257 --> 00:24:19,781
第一排先走，第二排跟上
First row first, followed by the second.

308
00:24:19,858 --> 00:24:21,325
佛兰克
Frank.

309
00:24:22,728 --> 00:24:25,492
当上帝把房屋连根拔起时？
"When God rips houses off the ground"?

310
00:24:26,632 --> 00:24:28,156
我有点兴奋
I was rolling.

311
00:24:28,667 --> 00:24:31,295
我不是故意把你名字放那上面的
And I didn't mean to put you on the spot up there.

312
00:24:32,104 --> 00:24:35,039
我对你组员的事情很遗憾
And I was real sorry to hear about your crew.

313
00:24:35,574 --> 00:24:37,804
来吧，我带你转转
Come on. I'll show you around.

314
00:24:38,677 --> 00:24:41,771
- 我听说你现在一个人？  - 对
- So I hear you're staying in a single?  - Yeah.

315
00:24:42,514 --> 00:24:45,881
海伦有些家庭事务要在那处理
Helen's got some family business she's gotta take care of up there.

316
00:24:48,654 --> 00:24:50,554
求救，求救，求救
Mayday, mayday, mayday!

317
00:24:50,989 --> 00:24:53,651
这是博玛雷纳号，博玛雷纳号
This is Ballmariner! Ballmariner!

318
00:24:54,126 --> 00:24:57,425
我们着火了，着火了
We are on fire! We are on fire!

319
00:25:20,152 --> 00:25:21,210
出发

跑啊，跑啊
Let's move it out! Let's move it out!

322
00:25:26,692 --> 00:25:28,990
相互配合，相互配合
Work as a team! Work as a team!

323
00:25:30,829 --> 00:25:31,887
- 排两行  - 排两行

324
00:25:31,964 --> 00:25:33,261
- 排两行  - 排两行

325
00:25:54,753 --> 00:25:56,118
听懂了吗？
Do you understand me?

326
00:25:56,188 --> 00:25:57,553
懂了，霍尔上士
Yes, Petty Officer Hall.

327
00:25:57,623 --> 00:26:00,251
很好，我们来试试，俯卧撑
Very well, let's try it. Lean and rest!

328
00:26:02,427 --> 00:26:04,019
起来
Pop tall.

329
00:26:04,529 --> 00:26:05,621
乌拉
Oorah!

330
00:26:05,697 --> 00:26:07,164
- 这他妈的成什么样子  - 太差了
What the hell was that?  - HALL: That was terrible.

331
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:08,221
没见过更差的
That was the worst I've ever seen.

332
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:09,289
太差了
That was terrible.

333
00:26:09,368 --> 00:26:10,858
再试一遍
Let's try that again.

334
00:26:21,346 --> 00:26:22,973
- 二十二  - 加油
Twenty-two. Come on!

335
00:26:23,048 --> 00:26:24,310
- 上  - 二十三
- Up!  - Twenty-three.

336
00:26:24,383 --> 00:26:25,748
下，上
Down. Up.

337
00:26:25,817 --> 00:26:27,876
- 二十四  - 屁股下去，小子
- Twenty-four.  - Get that ass down, Cable!

338
00:26:27,953 --> 00:26:29,318
- 上  - 二十五
- Up!  - Twenty-five.

339
00:26:29,788 --> 00:26:31,915
实在太差了
That is absolutely horrible.

340
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:34,891
起来跑到松树那再回来，出发
Pop tall to the lone pine and back! Go!

341
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:38,327
快跑，动起来，出发
Move your ass! Let's move it! Get it going!

342
00:26:38,497 --> 00:26:39,521
快跑
Let's go.

343
00:26:41,767 --> 00:26:42,756
快跑
Let's go.

344
00:26:43,001 --> 00:26:44,298
让他们回来
Bring them back.

345
00:26:44,369 --> 00:26:47,338
- 回来  - 快跑，回去
Circle back!  - HALL: Let's go! Get back here!

346
00:26:47,406 --> 00:26:48,737
- 回来站队  - 快点
Get back in line!  - INSTRUCTOR: Let's move!

347
00:26:48,807 --> 00:26:50,570
- 站好队  - 快跑，快，快
- Back in formation.  - Let's move, move, move!

348
00:26:50,642 --> 00:26:52,542
站好队
Back in formation.

349
00:26:53,612 --> 00:26:56,137
俯卧撑姿势，二级军士长来检查
Lean and rest. Senior Chief on deck.

350
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:31,744
起来
Pop tall.

351
00:27:33,018 --> 00:27:34,042
乌拉
Oorah!

352
00:27:34,686 --> 00:27:36,517
我不在乎你是谁
I don't care who you are,

353
00:27:36,788 --> 00:27:38,722
从哪来，到哪去
where you are from or where you are going.

354
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:40,724
我只在乎一件事
I care about one thing and one thing only.

355
00:27:40,792 --> 00:27:43,784
就是将来要求你们救的人
That is the future victims that you will be asked to save.

356
00:27:43,862 --> 00:27:47,628
如果我觉得你救不了他们 我就会开除你，懂了吗？
If I feel that you will fail them, I will fail you, understood?

357
00:27:47,699 --> 00:27:49,997
明白，二级军士长
Yes, Senior Chief!

358
00:27:52,104 --> 00:27:54,800
霍吉，你从哪来？
Hodge. Where are you from, Hodge?

359
00:27:54,873 --> 00:27:57,068
我来自新泽西州提奈克 二级军士长!
I'm from Teaneck, New Jersey, Senior Chief!

360
00:27:57,142 --> 00:27:59,235
霍吉这是第三次尝试了
Hodge is our triple repeat.

361
00:28:00,078 --> 00:28:02,546
你这回打算通过吗？三进宫？
Do you plan on making it this time, threepeat?

362
00:28:02,614 --> 00:28:03,876
我真的希望可以，二级军士长
I really hope to, Senior Chief.

363
00:28:03,949 --> 00:28:05,780
好，不过，希望不能让你浮起来，霍吉
Yeah, well, hope don't float, Hodge.

364
00:28:05,851 --> 00:28:08,877
你最好开始学习逆流而游而不是顺流而下
You better start to learn to swim against the current and not with it.

365
00:28:08,954 --> 00:28:10,854
遵命，二级军士长
Aye, aye, Senior Chief.

366
00:28:11,623 --> 00:28:12,885
费舍
Fisch.

367
00:28:14,259 --> 00:28:16,591
费舍，你为什么要来？
Fisch. Why are you here, Fisch?

368
00:28:17,162 --> 00:28:20,063
我要来超出你的预期 二级军士长
I'm here to exceed your expectations, Senior Chief.

369
00:28:20,132 --> 00:28:23,659
我从心底就是救生员 生来如此，水中长大，乌拉
I'm a rescue swimmer at heart, born, bred and water-fed. Oorah!

370
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:27,198
哇，我猜你整个早上都在练这个吧
Wow. I bet you practiced that all morning.

371
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:30,433
费舍尔是高中游泳冠军
Mr. Fischer is our high school swim champ.

372
00:28:30,509 --> 00:28:33,307
他拿到了常春藤所有学校的奖学金
He's had scholarships to every lvy League.

373
00:28:33,745 --> 00:28:37,306
哦，对不起，我没意识到他这么合格
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't realize that he was so qualified.

374
00:28:37,516 --> 00:28:39,984
我是说，你在池子里创造记录吗？
I mean, you set records in a pool?

375
00:28:40,819 --> 00:28:41,877
太棒了
That's amazing.

376
00:28:41,953 --> 00:28:45,684
我猜最深的地方大概有八尺深吧？
I'll bet it was like, what, eight feet deep in the deep end?

377
00:28:47,225 --> 00:28:49,420
要是你的鼻塞不起作用怎么办？
What if your nose plug didn't work?

378
00:28:49,494 --> 00:28:52,588
如果其他救生员占了你的泳道呢？
What if another swimmer had cut into your lane?

379
00:28:56,001 --> 00:28:59,129
看在上帝份上，你可能会死的
For the love of God, you could have been killed.

380
00:29:00,472 --> 00:29:03,407
你们日程上安排你们今早进行体力测试
Your schedule says that you will perform a PT test this morning.

381
00:29:03,475 --> 00:29:05,340
这没有必要
That will not be necessary.

382
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:08,072
你们被召来在水中服役
Water is where you've been called to serve.

383
00:29:08,146 --> 00:29:10,011
那你们就在水里测试好了
Water is where you will be tested.

384
00:29:15,187 --> 00:29:17,917
这将替代你们的体力测试
This will serve in place of your PT in-test.

385
00:29:17,989 --> 00:29:20,549
考试结果只有通过或不通过
This is a golno-go exercise.

386
00:29:21,927 --> 00:29:24,395
你们要踩水一个小时
You will tread water for one hour.

387
00:29:24,696 --> 00:29:29,030
你碰了墙，不通过 碰了底，不通过
You touch the wall, you fail. You touch the bottom, you fail.

388
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:31,125
不通过就回家
You fail and you go home.

389
00:29:32,037 --> 00:29:35,200
军士长，本校执行的是两次不通过制度
Senior, this school operates on a two-challenge rule.

390
00:29:35,273 --> 00:29:37,298
你不能第一天就开除人啊
You can't throw them out on their first day.

391
00:29:37,375 --> 00:29:39,400
如果你在暖水池都撑不过去
If you cannot survive in a warm pool of water,

392
00:29:39,478 --> 00:29:42,845
这就没你什么事了，全班明白了吗？
then you have no business being here. Does this class understand?

393
00:29:42,914 --> 00:29:44,211
明白，二级军士长

Now, who here can tell me the rescue swimmer's motto?

喔，我觉得安全点了

You will have to earn that right. I want all of you to think about that.

401

总有这样的时候
There's going to come a time

402
00:30:07,472 --> 00:30:11,272
你们会筋疲力尽，想要放弃了
when you reach the point of exhaustion and you wanna give up.

403
00:30:11,743 --> 00:30:14,735
问题是，你们会不会

Look at that.

407
00:30:52,751 --> 00:30:54,275
浪费时间

- 你还好吗？  - 嘿，加油，待在上面

00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:50,534
你被开除了
You're dismissed.

418
00:31:51,309 --> 00:31:53,834
- 我肌肉痉挛了  - 你死了
- I cramped up.  - You're gone.

419
00:31:55,213 --> 00:31:56,840
走吧，里昂，出来，快点

420
00:31:56,915 --> 00:31:58,940

Let's go.

421
00:32:00,719 --> 00:32:02,209
站起来

00:32:03,154 --> 00:32:07,989
物理学第一课，各位： 有肌肉并不会浮起来
First lesson in physics, people: Muscle does not float.

423

428
00:32:19,838 --> 00:32:21,806
版主，来这

我以为你说你愿意牺牲自己救他人的
I thought you said you were willing to sacrifice your life for another.

430
00:32:31,182 --> 00:32:32,843
是的，二级军士长
I am, Senior Chief.

431
00:32:32,917 --> 00:32:36,679
那他向你求救时，干嘛不救自己的队友
Then why didn't you save your teammate when he reached out for you?

432
00:32:39,090 --> 00:32:42,548
我没意识到我们是整队合作的，二级军士长
I wasn't aware we were working as a team, Senior Chief.

433
00:32:43,128 --> 00:32:45,824
这是我们唯一的工作方式，游泳冠军
That's the only way we work, swim champ.

434
00:32:49,367 --> 00:32:51,301
明白，二级军士长
Aye, aye, Senior Chief.

435
00:33:03,415 --> 00:33:04,746
混蛋
Asshole.

436
00:33:04,816 --> 00:33:06,943
- 再说一遍  - 你听见我说的了
- Come again?  - You heard me.

437
00:33:07,018 --> 00:33:09,384
嘿，嘿，别动手

438
00:33:10,321 --> 00:33:11,845
- 不值得  - 别
- It's not worth it.  - Come on.

439
00:33:11,923 --> 00:33:14,448
有个好消息，里昂 我的浮标维护船上有个空缺
Good news, Lyons. I think there's an opening on my buoy tender.

440
00:33:14,526 --> 00:33:16,824
我帮你推荐一下吧
I'll put in a word for you, huh?

441
00:33:19,364 --> 00:33:21,662
我会怀念那家伙的
I'm really gonna miss that guy.

442
00:33:27,405 --> 00:33:30,704
- 嘿，伙计，你干嘛？  - 你得回自己的铺位了
- Hey, man, what are you doing?  - Got your bunk back.

443

你干的太快了
You work fast.

445
00:33:41,653 --> 00:33:44,383
里昂是我们最佳候选人之一
Lyons, he was one of our top candidates.

446
00:33:45,290 --> 00:33:47,690
有时你还得射杀人质呢
Sometimes you gotta shoot a hostage.

447
00:33:47,759 --> 00:33:51,160
嘿，我们都知道你是传奇人物
Look, we all know that you're a legend and all,

448
00:33:52,197 --> 00:33:54,791
但我们的课程已经被证实很有效果
but our program has been proven to work.

449
00:33:54,866 --> 00:33:57,994
训练和实际之间是有差距的，狂犬
There's a gap between training and what really happens out there, Cujo.

450
00:33:58,069 --> 00:33:59,468
- 哦，真的？  - 没错
- Oh, really?  - That's right.

451
00:33:59,537 --> 00:34:00,970
我的目的就是要缩小这个差距
My intention is to narrow that gap.

452
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:04,031
如果有谁有不同意见
Now, if someone has a problem with that idea,

453
00:34:04,709 --> 00:34:06,734
我洗耳恭听
I'd like to hear about it.

454
00:34:11,216 --> 00:34:13,514
这就是我们要做的吗？长官
Is this how it's gonna be, sir?

455
00:34:16,354 --> 00:34:17,719
没错
Yes, it is.

456
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:22,254
- 请求离开，长官  - 批准
Permission to be dismissed, sir?  - CAPTAIN: Granted.

457
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:31,792
快走，快走，靠紧
Let's go. Let's go. Keep it together. Look tight!

458
00:34:31,870 --> 00:34:33,735

Keep it together. Let's go. Let's move.

463
00:34:55,026 --> 00:34:56,823
加油，救生员
Come on, rescue swimmer!

464
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:00,595
别放弃
Don't quit on me.

465
00:35:16,147 --> 00:35:17,978
听见了吗？
Do you hear me?

466
00:35:18,049 --> 00:35:19,448
听见了吗？
Do you hear me?

467
00:35:19,717 --> 00:35:23,278
起来，起来
Pop tall! Pop tall! Pop tall!

468
00:35:26,057 --> 00:35:30,790
如果你犯了个错，就认错 吸取教训继续
If you make a mistake, just fess up to it. Take your licks and we'll press on.

469
00:35:31,062 --> 00:35:34,554
每个人都会为笨嘴付出代价
Everybody now is gonna pay for your potty mouth.

476
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:50,442
你疯了吗？
Are you crazy?

477
00:35:50,648 --> 00:35:52,343
我是指挥官，起来
I'm the commander! Get up!

478
00:35:52,417 --> 00:35:54,885
- 乌拉  - 趴下，趴下

Oorah!

484
00:36:44,135 --> 00:36:46,603
氯气中毒会死吗？
Can you die from chlorine poisoning?

485
00:36:46,905 --> 00:36:49,430
我都感觉不到自己的腿了，我是说真的
I can't feel my legs. I'm serious.

486
00:36:50,475 --> 00:36:52,875
我不知道你们怎样，但是我感觉不错
I don't know about you guys, but I feel good.

487

这个叫朗道的，完全不按规矩来
This Randall guy, he's operating on some whole other cylinder.

488
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:59,072
这算啥，两个星期 他差不多都开除了一半人了
What is it, two weeks, and he's failed almost half the class already?

489

他是传奇人物

我听说是三百

492
00:37:04,355 --> 00:37:06,346
谁管他救过多少？
Who cares what his number is?

493
00:37:06,424 --> 00:37:08,892
他要是这么牛，来这干嘛
If he's such a stud, what's he doing here?

我答应她我会去的

Helen, it's Ben. Jesus, that was weird.

Haven't had to use your maiden name since we were kids.

510

529
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:53,349
有谣言说你要在城里教书啊
I heard a rumor you were gonna be teaching here in town.

530
00:39:53,424 --> 00:39:56,689
这要不是命运，我都不知道还能是什么
If that ain't the karmic wheel spinning, I don't know what is.

531
00:39:57,495 --> 00:40:01,431
好啦，敬回头的浪子
Well. To the prodigal's return.

532
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:06,100
- 你的另一半呢？  - 她决定待在家
- Where's your better half?  - She decided to stay home.

533
00:40:06,838 --> 00:40:08,999
- 哦  - 工作的事情
- Oh.  - Work stuff.

534
00:40:09,874 --> 00:40:14,334
是啊，科迪亚克的冬天 让我看看，路易斯安娜的冬天
Yeah. Winter in Kodiak. Let me see. Winter in Louisiana.

535
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:16,903
- 好啦，别说了  - 她决定待在家
- All right, stop. Stop.  - "She decided to stay home."

536
00:40:18,082 --> 00:40:21,176
好事情是我们还有整瓶酒和半个晚上
Well, it's a good thing we got a full bottle and half the night.

537
00:40:21,252 --> 00:40:22,651
没错
Yes, we do.

538
00:40:25,389 --> 00:40:28,153
看看，她盯着你看呢
Check it out. She's staring at you.

539
00:40:28,893 --> 00:40:30,554
那个女孩没盯着我看
That girl right there is not staring at me.

540
00:40:30,628 --> 00:40:32,425
你用手指她了
Did you just point at her?

541
00:40:32,497 --> 00:40:34,624
- 她看见你指她了吗？  - 我不知道
- Did she see you point?  - I don't know.

542
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,730
好啦，你得去跟她谈谈，你得主动
All right, now you gotta go talk to her. You gotta go make a move.

543
00:40:38,803 --> 00:40:40,771
- 没错  - 我不行
- Yeah.  - I can't.

544
00:40:40,838 --> 00:40:43,773
我现在不想和女人聊天
I just don't feel comfortable right now talking to women.

545
00:40:43,841 --> 00:40:45,775
你想告诉我你愿意跳出直升机
You're telling me you wanna jump out of helicopters

546
00:40:45,843 --> 00:40:47,174
- 去救人  - 你和我聊了
- for a living...  - You're talking to me.

547
00:40:47,245 --> 00:40:48,576
但不愿意和女孩聊天？
...but you can't go talk to a girl?

548
00:40:48,646 --> 00:40:51,308
- 没错，这就是我想说的  - 真能说会道啊
- That's exactly what I was telling you.  - You're smooth.

549
00:40:51,382 --> 00:40:53,247
好啦，我来帮帮你
All right, look, I'm gonna help you out here.

550
00:40:53,317 --> 00:40:55,251
我给你演示一下怎么做
I'll show you how it's done.

551
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:58,953
找这里最辣的妞，我会带她回家
Pick out the hottest girl in here. I'll take her home.

552
00:40:59,023 --> 00:41:00,547
- 哦，天啊  - 好啊
- Oh, gosh.  - Okay.

553
00:41:00,625 --> 00:41:04,083
- 他又来了  - 不，我来选妞如何？
- Here he go, now.  - No, how about I will find the girl?

554
00:41:04,195 --> 00:41:05,321
行啊
All right.

555
00:41:06,364 --> 00:41:08,298
- 好  - 你觉得哪一个？
- Okey-doke.  - Who you thinking?

556
00:41:08,366 --> 00:41:10,129
一定要辣
Make sure she's hot.

557
00:41:11,169 --> 00:41:13,228
- 你看哪呢？  - 好
- Where you looking?  - Okay.

558
00:41:13,304 --> 00:41:15,738
吧台那里，两点钟方向
At the bar. Two o'clock.

559
00:41:19,410 --> 00:41:21,901
- 不错  - 那个不错
- Yes.  - That's a good one.

560
00:41:22,246 --> 00:41:23,838
她不可能和你聊的
There's no way in hell she's talking to you.

561
00:41:23,915 --> 00:41:25,644
- 那一个？  - 没错，那个
- That one?  - Yeah, that one.

562
00:41:25,816 --> 00:41:29,919
我出一百美元，她一分钟就会把你拒了
Hundred bucks says she shuts you down in less than a minute.

563
00:41:30,788 --> 00:41:31,846
喔
Boom.

564
00:41:31,923 --> 00:41:34,892
- 我看这好像赌注啊，杰克  - 是赌注
- That looks like a bet to me, Jake.  - That's a bet.

565
00:41:37,895 --> 00:41:40,295
好啦，好啦
All right. All right.

566
00:41:40,364 --> 00:41:43,527
一百美元，我一分钟就能把她搞上手
Hundred bucks says I close in less than a minute.

567
00:41:43,601 --> 00:41:45,159
哦，没问题
Oh, absolutely.

568
00:41:48,372 --> 00:41:51,432
- 向你致敬，伙计  - 嘀哒，嘀哒，嘀哒
- Hats off, man.  - Tick-tock. Tick-tock. Tick-tock.

569
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:53,500
从我和她说话开始
Clock starts when I talk to her.

570
00:41:53,578 --> 00:41:54,602
没问题
That's fine.

571
00:41:54,679 --> 00:41:55,668
绝对让人尴尬
This is gonna be embarrassing.

572
00:41:55,746 --> 00:41:56,770
好啦，伙计
All right, buddy.

573
00:41:56,847 --> 00:41:58,109
你觉得怎样？
What do you think? What do you got?

574
00:41:58,182 --> 00:42:00,241
- 你觉得他能做到吗？  - 是的
You think he's gonna do it?  - CADET 2: Yeah.

575
00:42:04,822 --> 00:42:07,416
晚安，女士，我可以给你买杯酒吗？
Evening, ma'am. Can I buy you a drink?

576
00:42:10,661 --> 00:42:12,424
这样不好吧
I don't think so.

577
00:42:13,965 --> 00:42:16,456
你不会知道自己错过了什么
You don't know what you're missing.

578
00:42:20,438 --> 00:42:22,668
你肯定要玩这套吗？
You sure you wanna go with that one?

579
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:25,334
说你最棒啦，什么都玩的转啦
That's, like, your top-of-the-line, A-game material?

580
00:42:28,279 --> 00:42:31,373
依我看，你有两个选择
See, the way I see it, you got two choices here:

581
00:42:32,683 --> 00:42:33,911
离开我这里
Walk away from me,

582
00:42:33,985 --> 00:42:36,453
或者和我一起离开，我们平分那钱
or walk out of here with me and split the cash.

583
00:42:38,256 --> 00:42:39,245
钱？
Cash?

584
00:42:41,125 --> 00:42:42,490
什么钱？
What cash?

585
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:45,893
你和你朋友赌的说你能吊到我的
The money you bet your friends you could pick me up.

586
00:42:48,399 --> 00:42:50,196
嘿，那让我很紧张啊
See, that makes me nervous.

587
00:42:50,268 --> 00:42:51,826
她正在拒绝他呢
She's shutting him down.

588
00:42:54,272 --> 00:42:56,467
你还有多少时间？
How much time you got left?

589
00:42:58,476 --> 00:43:01,172
- 大概20秒钟  - 走吧？
- About 20 seconds.  - Shall we?

590
00:43:04,081 --> 00:43:05,548
- 哦，天啊  - 不可能
Oh, my gosh.  - No way.

591
00:43:05,616 --> 00:43:08,084
看起来他们好像要一起离开酒吧啊
It looks like they're leaving the bar together, is what I see.

592
00:43:08,152 --> 00:43:09,779
不可能
No way!

593
00:43:09,854 --> 00:43:11,344
一定是蒙我
You have got to be kidding me.

594
00:43:11,422 --> 00:43:12,912
- 难以置信  - 他怎么做到的？
- Unbelievable.  - How did he do that?

595
00:43:12,990 --> 00:43:15,015
- 我被震住了  - 我被震住了
- I'm impressed.  - I'm impressed.

596
00:43:15,626 --> 00:43:18,789
你基地外面有个酒吧叫玛吉，你知道吗？
There's a bar outside your base called Maggie's. You know it?

597
00:43:18,863 --> 00:43:19,921
知道
Yeah.

598
00:43:19,997 --> 00:43:23,194
好，下周五8点在那见我
Good. Meet me there next Friday around 8:00?

599
00:43:23,267 --> 00:43:25,360
- 你有名字吗？  - 有
- You got a name?  - Yeah.

600
00:43:26,003 --> 00:43:27,868
别忘带我的钱
Don't forget my money.

601
00:43:32,977 --> 00:43:34,842
有中名吗？
You got a middle name?

602
00:43:37,548 --> 00:43:40,244
你该意识到我回不去那吧
You do realize I can't go back in there.

603
00:43:44,155 --> 00:43:45,816
这是死神的敲门声
This is the sound of death knocking.

604
00:43:45,890 --> 00:43:48,654
搜救警报和缺梦少觉是…
SAR alarms and sleep deprivation are part...

605
00:43:50,695 --> 00:43:52,663
他们到底跑哪去了？
Where the hell are they?

606
00:44:04,809 --> 00:44:08,745
知道吗，低温病的第一阶段是最关键的
You know, the first stages of hypothermia are the most critical.

607
00:44:08,813 --> 00:44:09,802
为什么
Why?

608
00:44:10,748 --> 00:44:13,774
因为你还有能力想，跟我说
Because you still have the ability to think. Say it.

609
00:44:13,851 --> 00:44:17,014
你还有能力想
You still have the ability to think.

610
00:44:17,088 --> 00:44:19,886
你在这个阶段做出的决定
The decisions you make during this stage

611
00:44:19,957 --> 00:44:23,791
将决定你的生死
are gonna determine whether you live or die.

612
00:44:23,994 --> 00:44:26,258
有什么理由你不呼吸吗？金鱼？
There a reason you're not breathing, Goldfish?

613
00:44:27,064 --> 00:44:28,827
有什么理由你不呼吸吗
Is there a reason why you're not breathing?

614
00:44:30,301 --> 00:44:32,792
我不知道谁不呼吸15分钟还能活
I don't know anyone who can stay alive without breathing

615
00:44:33,017 --> 00:44:34,096
二级军士长
for 15 minutes, Senior Chief.

616
00:44:34,739 --> 00:44:36,400
你是验尸官吗？
Are you a coroner?

617
00:44:37,441 --> 00:44:40,740
宣告他人死亡可没在我们的工作介绍上啊
Because pronouncing people dead is not part of our job description.

618
00:44:40,811 --> 00:44:42,301
我们总说什么？
What do we always say?

619
00:44:42,380 --> 00:44:44,848
死透了才是死
There's dead and then there's dead.

620
00:44:46,016 --> 00:44:49,577
我们从不停止，杰克 不管是机舱里还是停机坪上
We never stop, Jake, not from the cabin to the tarmac.

621
00:44:49,653 --> 00:44:51,678
- 我们从不停止  - 明白，二级军士长
- We never stop.  - Aye, aye, Senior Chief.

622
00:44:51,756 --> 00:44:54,418
- 懂了吗？  - 懂了，二级军士长
Understood?  - CADETS: Yes, Senior Chief.

623
00:44:54,492 --> 00:44:57,290
好，杰克，回池子里来，霍吉，你上去
Okay, Jake, in the pool. Hodge, you're up.

624
00:44:57,495 --> 00:44:58,826
你来和假人演习
You're with the dummy.

625
00:45:00,865 --> 00:45:03,060
好，现在，三个字
All right, now. Three letters.

626
00:45:03,567 --> 00:45:06,900
说那三个字你就能拿到一杯热咖啡，还有毯子
Three letters will get you people a cup of hot coffee and a blanket.

627
00:45:08,839 --> 00:45:10,830
你怎么说，金鱼？
What do you say, Goldfish?

628
00:45:11,509 --> 00:45:14,137
其实我不那么冷了，二级军士长
I'm actually not that cold anymore, Senior Chief.

629
00:45:14,211 --> 00:45:17,703
你不冷了，是因为你的血在流动
You're not cold anymore because blood is moving

630
00:45:17,782 --> 00:45:20,046
从四肢流回心脏
from your outer extremities to your heart.

631
00:45:20,117 --> 00:45:22,449
因此你的胳膊动不了了
That's why your arms won't work.

632
00:45:22,987 --> 00:45:26,650
你该计划好，你事业的60％时间
You can plan on spending roughly 60% of your career

633
00:45:26,724 --> 00:45:28,658
你将处在轻度低温病状态
in a mildly hypothermic state.

634
00:45:28,993 --> 00:45:31,325
二级军士长，我可以说句话吗？
Senior Chief, may I have a word?

635
00:45:45,543 --> 00:45:46,532
长官？
Sir?

636
00:45:48,045 --> 00:45:51,037
我怎么没得到通知？我们有教室的
Why wasn't I informed of this? You know, we have classrooms.

637
00:45:51,115 --> 00:45:54,915
你的职责只是教他们低温病的各个阶段
Your assignment is to simply teach the stages of hypothermia.

638
00:45:55,052 --> 00:46:00,547
长官，再过大概两分半，他们就会理解的
Sir, in about two and a half minutes, they'll understand.

639
00:46:04,295 --> 00:46:06,422
请求继续，长官
Permission to carry on, sir?

640
00:46:08,499 --> 00:46:09,488
继续吧
Go ahead.

641
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:27,515
三个字，各位，你就能拿到一杯热咖啡 还有温暖的毯子
Three letters, people, will get you a hot cup of coffee and a warm blanket.

642
00:46:28,586 --> 00:46:31,384
你们怎么办，5506班
What do you say, Class 5506?

643
00:46:32,022 --> 00:46:33,614
乌拉
Oorah.

644
00:46:42,299 --> 00:46:45,496
这是缺氧存活训练
This is an oxygen-deprivation anaerobic exercise.

645
00:46:46,237 --> 00:46:48,603
你和你的同伴要推一块砖头
You and your partner will push your brick

646
00:46:48,672 --> 00:46:52,130
沿着游泳池底，推过去再推回来
along the bottom of the pool, down and back.

647
00:46:53,544 --> 00:46:56,809
如果你需要换气，你可以上浮，换一口气
If you need air, you may surface. One breath.

648
00:46:57,948 --> 00:47:01,315
你的同伴必须待在水下，直到你回来
Your partner must remain underwater until you return.

649
00:47:02,686 --> 00:47:06,713
只有你们两个都碰到砖头时，才能推它
Your brick can only move while both of you are touching it.

650
00:47:08,125 --> 00:47:11,561
如果你们一起浮上来，你们一起失败
If you both surface, you both fail.

651
00:47:12,696 --> 00:47:15,961
这个训练旨在教你们如何合作
This exercise is designed to teach you teamwork.

652
00:47:16,767 --> 00:47:20,635
听我哨音，脱掉装备，成对进池
On my whistle, drop your gear, enter the pool and pair up.

653
00:47:51,902 --> 00:47:54,530
我说换一口气，小子，快下去
I said one breath, Sunkist. Let's go!

654
00:47:55,306 --> 00:47:56,398
- 我不行了  - 快点
- I can't.  - Come on!

655
00:47:56,473 --> 00:47:57,667
- 我不行  - “不行”
- I can't.  - "I can't."

656
00:47:57,741 --> 00:48:00,403
滚出池子去，快点
Get your ass out of the pool! Let's go!

657
00:48:02,413 --> 00:48:04,472
快点，俯卧撑姿势
Come on! Lean and rest.

658
00:48:04,548 --> 00:48:07,540
你想退出，退出吧，我可以换点新人
You wanna quit, just quit now. I could use those new shoes.

659
00:48:07,618 --> 00:48:09,882
二级军士长，出事了
Senior Chief, we got a problem.

660
00:48:10,788 --> 00:48:12,756
有人失踪了
Somebody's missing.

661
00:48:18,195 --> 00:48:19,662
耶稣基督啊
Jesus Christ.

662
00:48:29,573 --> 00:48:32,201
要有新记录了，乌拉
That's gotta be a new record. Oorah.

663
00:48:33,611 --> 00:48:36,478
我烦透记录了，把他弄上来
I'm so sick of records. Go get him.

664
00:48:55,866 --> 00:48:59,996
你觉得我会因为你能憋气而震撼吗？金鱼
You think I'm impressed because you can hold your breath, Goldfish?

665
00:49:02,006 --> 00:49:05,908
我不知道什么能让你震撼，二级军士长
I wouldn't venture to say what would impress you, Senior Chief.

666
00:49:12,116 --> 00:49:14,676
好啦，让他出池子，今天到此为止
All right. Get him out of the pool. We're done for the day.

667
00:49:14,752 --> 00:49:17,414
出池子，费舍尔，快点
Out of the pool, Fischer. Let's move.

668
00:49:21,792 --> 00:49:23,817
- 乌拉  - 快点
- Oorah!  - Move your ass.

669
00:49:26,196 --> 00:49:27,322
起来，小子
Pop tall, Sunkist.

670
00:49:27,398 --> 00:49:28,990
出池，出池
Out of the pool. Out of the pool.

671
00:49:36,507 --> 00:49:37,496
记录
Records.

672
00:49:40,044 --> 00:49:42,535
绝不要盯着火焰看，各位
Never stare directly into the flame, people.

673
00:49:42,613 --> 00:49:44,547
会损害你的夜晚视力的
It will impair your night vision.

674
00:49:44,615 --> 00:49:48,449
这是马克58型闪光弹，看起来就这样
This is a Mark 58 flare. This is what it looks like.

675
00:49:49,019 --> 00:49:51,351
这能照亮50尺宽的一片水
It'll light up a 50-foot swath of water

676
00:49:51,422 --> 00:49:54,289
用红外线可以在几英里外测到
and can be detected by infrared miles out.

677
00:49:56,260 --> 00:49:57,989
这是用来演示的
This is a demonstration model.

678
00:49:58,062 --> 00:50:00,724
正常的可以燃40到60分钟
The normal one will burn for 40 to 60 minutes.

679
00:50:00,798 --> 00:50:02,459
注意
Hey, pay attention.

680
00:50:02,533 --> 00:50:07,368
马克58时用来标示风向和水流向的
The Mark 58 is used to reference the wind, to detect a current.

681
00:50:07,438 --> 00:50:10,032
沃特森上士将会给你们详细讲一下
Petty Officer Watson is gonna talk a little bit more about that.

682
00:50:12,176 --> 00:50:13,768
五分钟
Five minutes.

683
00:50:20,250 --> 00:50:22,275
你看到的这条船
The vessel you're looking at right now,

684
00:50:22,352 --> 00:50:23,944
正在向左舷倾侧
people, is listing to the port side.

685
00:50:24,021 --> 00:50:26,615
作为救生员，到了直升机门那
As a rescue swimmer, when you get to the door of the helicopter,

686
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:28,453
你得看下面，注意
you need to look down and pay attention

687
00:50:28,525 --> 00:50:30,891
看下面到底有什么情况
to what you really have down there.

688
00:50:30,961 --> 00:50:34,488
知道自己能力的极限是非常重要的
It's very important that you understand your limitations.

689
00:50:34,565 --> 00:50:38,194
不知道，你就会死
Limitations without understanding are gonna get you killed.

690
00:50:38,268 --> 00:50:42,500
在这起事件中，船陷在 白令海峡中的大堆冰块里了
Case in point, this vessel's trapped in pancake ice in the Bering Sea.

691
00:50:42,840 --> 00:50:44,740
你们能看到，船员上了甲板
And as you can see, the crew are out on the deck

692
00:50:44,808 --> 00:50:47,538
在一个容易起吊的位置
in a relatively manageable hoisting position.

693
00:50:47,611 --> 00:50:49,203
但忽然之间
But suddenly...

694
00:50:51,048 --> 00:50:54,108
那些冰块的重量高达几千磅
Those pieces of ice can weigh in upwards of thousands of pounds.

695
00:50:54,184 --> 00:50:58,917
想象一下被2000磅重的冰块挤压的情况下
Now imagine yourself trapped in between 2,000-pound pieces of ice

696
00:50:58,989 --> 00:51:00,616
还要游泳的感觉
trying to free-swim.

697
00:51:00,691 --> 00:51:01,783
谢谢，军事长
Thank you, Chief.

698
00:51:01,859 --> 00:51:04,419
下一节，沃特森上士
Next scenario, Petty Officer Watson.

699
00:51:04,995 --> 00:51:07,486
在你离开直升机，跳下…
Before you leave that helicopter, going down to a...

700
00:51:07,564 --> 00:51:12,467
标准化能确保我们 在卡特里娜飓风影响下成功行动
Standardization is one of the reasons we were so successful during Katrina.

701
00:51:12,536 --> 00:51:15,437
我们的同事来自全国各地
We had crews come in from all over the country,

702
00:51:15,506 --> 00:51:18,942
但这没关系 因为我们接受的都是相同的训练
but it didn't matter, because we have all been trained the same way.

703
00:51:19,009 --> 00:51:21,739
我不认识驾驶员，不认识副驾驶
I didn't know my pilot, I didn't know my copilot,

704
00:51:21,812 --> 00:51:23,837
我不认识机师，但有什么关系呢？
I didn't know my flight mechanic. But guess what?

705
00:51:23,914 --> 00:51:25,313
这都无关紧要，因为…
It didn't matter, because...

706
00:51:25,382 --> 00:51:26,508
我们干的就是这个
That's why we do it.

707
00:51:26,583 --> 00:51:29,074
因此你们要把注意力集中在这上面
So you have to get your mind wrapped around that idea.

708
00:51:29,153 --> 00:51:32,953
当直升机飞过来的时候 当起风的时候
When that helicopter starts going, when the wind starts coming...

709
00:51:33,023 --> 00:51:34,854
- 二十  - 下!上!
Twenty! Down! Up!

710
00:51:34,925 --> 00:51:36,688
- 二十一  - 下!上!
- Twenty-one!  - Down! Up!

711
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:38,660
- 二是二  - 下!上!
- Twenty-two!  - Down! Up!

712
00:51:38,729 --> 00:51:40,720
二十三
Twenty-three!

713
00:51:40,798 --> 00:51:42,288
- 二  - 下!
- Two!  - Down!

714
00:51:42,366 --> 00:51:43,924
- 上!  - 三
- Up!  - Three!

715
00:51:45,102 --> 00:51:47,195
不要陆地 不要森林
Don't need no land Don't need no tree

716
00:51:47,304 --> 00:51:49,738
我要去的是水里
Out in the water That's where I wanna be

717
00:52:03,020 --> 00:52:05,887
- 嘿，来杯啤酒怎么样？  - 没问题
Hey, Mags, can I have a beer?  - MAGGIE: Sure.

718
00:52:07,758 --> 00:52:09,783
好啊好啊
Well, well.

719
00:52:10,060 --> 00:52:12,654
终于答应跟我喝一杯了
So you are gonna have a drink with me.

720
00:52:12,729 --> 00:52:16,495
不，我是在你旁边喝 完全两码事
No, I'm having a drink near you. Entirely different thing.

721
00:52:18,702 --> 00:52:21,569
你从来就这样冷淡吗？
You're a regular lightning rod, aren't you?

722
00:52:22,172 --> 00:52:25,835
- 你叫什么名字？  - 戴茜・布克南
- What's your name?  - Daisy Buchanan.

723
00:52:27,377 --> 00:52:29,242
你在说谎，戴茜・布克南
You're lying, Daisy Buchanan.

724
00:52:30,147 --> 00:52:32,672
- 有这个可能性  - 不
- There is that possibility.  - No.

725
00:52:32,749 --> 00:52:34,740
这一定是谎话
That was a sure-fire lie.

726
00:52:34,818 --> 00:52:37,651
我想你是读过伟大的盖茨比了
So I take it you've read The Great Gatsby.

727
00:52:39,556 --> 00:52:43,014
- 我的钱呢？  - 我没带在身上
- Where's my money?  - It's not on me.

728
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:46,888
但是很接近了，在一个安全的地方
But it is close. In a very safe place.

729
00:52:47,264 --> 00:52:51,860
我画了张地图，里面有很复杂的线索
Now, I've drawn a map with a complex set of clues.

730
00:52:52,569 --> 00:52:55,732
每一步都比前一步难很多
Each one is more fiendishly clever than the last.

731
00:53:00,711 --> 00:53:02,269
好吧，这样也成
That works, too.

732
00:53:03,647 --> 00:53:06,013
这只是你裤子的图片而已
This is just a picture of your pants.

733
00:53:06,083 --> 00:53:10,611
是的，画的不好，但线索真的很难
Yeah, but it's a bad picture, which is what makes it so fiendishly clever.

734
00:53:10,954 --> 00:53:11,943
不错
Nice.

735
00:53:12,022 --> 00:53:14,388
为什么艾米丽・托马斯会成为教师呢？
How did Emily Thomas become a schoolteacher?

736
00:53:14,458 --> 00:53:16,358
为什么杰克・费舍尔会成为
Well, how does Jake Fischer become a guy

737
00:53:16,426 --> 00:53:18,894
想从直升机上跳下去的人呢？
who wants to jump out of helicopters?

738
00:53:20,163 --> 00:53:23,462
我干掉很多家伙，要找个地方躲起来
I killed a couple guys and had to get out of Dodge.

739
00:53:25,168 --> 00:53:28,262
- 你在说谎  - 有这个可能性
- You're lying.  - There is that possibility.

740
00:53:30,707 --> 00:53:31,833
说实话
The truth.

741
00:53:32,809 --> 00:53:35,403
我的牛仔生涯以失败告终了
My bull-riding career was going down the drain.

742
00:53:35,479 --> 00:53:39,245
- 比刚才有长进  - 好吧，到你了
- Okay, that's better.  - All right, now you.

743
00:53:43,387 --> 00:53:45,184
我真的得走了
I really should go.

744
00:53:45,255 --> 00:53:47,485
走？什么？不，别走
Go? What? No, you're not going.

745
00:53:47,557 --> 00:53:49,991
我们刚开始找到点乐趣 你侮辱了我的画
We're just starting to have fun. You're insulting my drawing.

746
00:53:50,060 --> 00:53:51,960
不，你自己侮辱了你的画
No, you were insulting your drawing.

747
00:53:52,029 --> 00:53:53,963
虽然，这是个很失败的画
Although, to be fair, it's a pretty lame drawing.

748
00:53:54,031 --> 00:53:56,522
好吧，你还不能走 因为你欠我一支舞
All right. Well, you can't go, 'cause you owe me a dance.

749
00:53:56,600 --> 00:53:57,760
不，才没有呢
No, I don't think so.

750
00:53:57,834 --> 00:53:59,631
好吧，那我要拿回我的钱
Well, then, I'm gonna have to take that money back,

751
00:53:59,703 --> 00:54:01,398
因为我觉得我不该得到这钱…
'cause I wouldn't feel right taking the money...

752
00:54:01,471 --> 00:54:03,666
听着，每18周，都有一批新的学员到来
Look, every 18 weeks, a new bunch of you guys comes in,

753
00:54:03,740 --> 00:54:05,867
都想得到女生的青睐
all looking to score with the local talent.

754
00:54:05,943 --> 00:54:08,036
我住这儿，我在这儿工作
I live here. I work here.

755
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:12,979
我只是请你跳一支舞
It's a good thing I'm just asking for a dance, then.

756
00:54:15,185 --> 00:54:16,812
好吧，一支舞
Okay, one dance.

757
00:54:18,588 --> 00:54:21,716
没有附加条件，临时的
No attachments. Just casual.

758
00:54:22,292 --> 00:54:25,056
我是个男人，我知道什么是临时的
I'm a guy. I can do casual.

759
00:54:25,362 --> 00:54:26,556
好吧
Mmm-hmm.

760
00:54:26,630 --> 00:54:28,928
我最拿手的就是临时
I am the king of casual.

761
00:54:31,301 --> 00:54:32,962
只是还有一件事
There's just one thing, though.

762
00:54:34,004 --> 00:54:36,666
你必须停下那种让我脱掉衣服的目光
You're gonna have to stop undressing me with your eyes,

763
00:54:36,740 --> 00:54:39,538
因为你可没本事把我搞上床
'cause there's no way you're getting me into bed.

764
00:55:22,419 --> 00:55:23,681
嘿
Hey, you.

765
00:55:26,490 --> 00:55:28,321
我得去上班了
I gotta get to work.

766
00:55:29,493 --> 00:55:32,189
- 我迟到了，睡过头了  - 什么
- I'm late. I fell asleep.  - What...

767
00:55:32,262 --> 00:55:33,991
- 他们会杀了我的  - 他们不会的
- They're gonna kill me.  - They won't kill you.

768
00:55:34,064 --> 00:55:35,088
这和学校不一样
This isn't like school.

769
00:55:35,165 --> 00:55:37,497
军队里可不会手下留情
They don't hand out tardies in the military.

770
00:55:39,336 --> 00:55:42,134
- 你闻起来好香  - 我闻起来像你的味道
- You smell really good.  - I smell like you.

771
00:55:48,478 --> 00:55:50,639
- 他还没回来？  - 没有
- He never came back?  - Nope.

772
00:55:51,581 --> 00:55:53,014
哇
Wow.

773
00:55:53,083 --> 00:55:56,746
我当教官的4年里还没有过队员出走
Four years as lead instructor, I never had one go missing.

774
00:55:58,088 --> 00:56:00,750
好吧，带其它人去泳池，这里交给我
All right, take the others to the pool. I'll catch up.

775
00:56:00,824 --> 00:56:02,485
是，长官
Aye, aye, Senior.

776
00:56:19,709 --> 00:56:22,109
天啊，他们来了 停，停车
Oh, God, there they are. Stop. Stop the car. Stop.

777
00:56:22,179 --> 00:56:23,168
- 就停这里？  - 是的
- Here?  - Yes.

778
00:56:23,246 --> 00:56:24,270
- 好的  - 我会打电话给你的
- Okay.  - I'll call you.

779
00:56:24,347 --> 00:56:25,439
最好如此，再见
You better. Bye.

780
00:56:27,851 --> 00:56:29,341
杰克!杰克!杰克!
Jake! Jake! Jake!

781
00:56:29,453 --> 00:56:32,479
飞行员费舍尔迟到了
Airman Fischer's coming in late, yeah

782
00:56:32,556 --> 00:56:33,545
给
Here.

783
00:56:33,623 --> 00:56:36,524
飞行员费舍尔迟到了
Airman Fischer's coming in late, yeah

784
00:56:36,593 --> 00:56:37,582
嗨
Hi.

785
00:56:41,431 --> 00:56:44,491
出去约会一定很快活
Must be nice to go out on a date, yeah

786
00:56:44,568 --> 00:56:47,594
出去约会一定很快活
Must be nice to go out on a date, yeah

787
00:56:48,338 --> 00:56:50,602
天啊，看这个
Oh, my goodness, look at this.

788
00:56:52,109 --> 00:56:55,374
看这个 “费舍尔带队取得州冠军”
Look at this. "Freshman Leads Team to State Title."

789
00:56:57,080 --> 00:56:58,445
这是你
That's you.

790
00:56:59,249 --> 00:57:00,273
天啊
Holy smokes.

791
00:57:00,350 --> 00:57:04,582
“16岁的杰克・费舍尔 已经成为成熟的运动员”
"At only 16, Jake Fischer displays the traits of a seasoned athlete.

792
00:57:05,388 --> 00:57:09,882
“有一件事是确定的： 这个年轻人有很美好的未来”
The future looks bright for this young competitor."

793
00:57:11,194 --> 00:57:15,062
我猜他们不知道你会被“A”学校退学
Guess they didn't know you were gonna flunk out of "A" School.

794
00:57:18,201 --> 00:57:20,192
昨晚过的不错吧？
You have a nice evening?

795
00:57:22,506 --> 00:57:23,939
把衣服换好
Get dressed.

796
00:57:43,693 --> 00:57:46,457
看来还要再加一块砖头 搬砖头
Think we need another brick. Bring it in.

797
00:57:49,132 --> 00:57:50,394
金鱼
Goldfish.

798
00:57:52,836 --> 00:57:54,133
金鱼
Goldfish.

799
00:58:03,780 --> 00:58:07,307
感谢由于费舍尔先生的课外活动
Thanks to Mr. Fischer's extracurricular activities,

800
00:58:07,384 --> 00:58:10,683
你们36小时不准睡觉
you have all now gone 36 hours without sleep.

801
00:58:12,088 --> 00:58:13,214
吹哨
Blow it.

802
00:58:17,994 --> 00:58:21,157
班长，你们完工了 去浅水区列队
Class leader, you are done. Form it up in the shallow end.

803
00:58:21,231 --> 00:58:22,391
是，二级军士长!
Aye, Senior Chief!

804
00:58:22,465 --> 00:58:25,161
5506班，列队!
Class 5506, form it up!

805
00:58:25,602 --> 00:58:30,130
不不不，你跟着我
No. No, no, no. You're with me.

806
00:58:34,344 --> 00:58:37,040
我是个救生员，是的，我是
I'm a rescue swimmer, yes, I am

807
00:58:37,113 --> 00:58:39,445
我来这里援救你们离开这该死的地方
I'm here to pull your ass out of this jam

808
00:58:39,516 --> 00:58:41,780
我跳出直升机，带着绳索
I jump from the helo and swing from the cable

809
00:58:41,851 --> 00:58:43,842
好了，停下
All right, knock it off.

810
00:58:44,754 --> 00:58:47,382
处理你还真不容易，费舍尔
I am having a hard time figuring you out, Fischer.

811
00:58:48,225 --> 00:58:51,490
我想你喜欢看到自己登报的照片
I mean, you like seeing your picture in the paper.

812
00:58:51,861 --> 00:58:54,762
看上去无上的荣耀，也许边上 还有几个小妞，我说的对吗？
In it for the glory, maybe a few chicks. Am I right?

813
00:58:54,831 --> 00:58:56,264
但来这里以后
But when it comes down to it,

814
00:58:56,333 --> 00:58:59,166
你必须超越从前
you will choose yourself over them every time,

815
00:58:59,236 --> 00:59:02,069
就像你第一天在池子里的那样
like you did on the first day in the pool,

816
00:59:02,539 --> 00:59:05,337
就像你昨天缺席集合那样
like you did yesterday by missing muster.

817
00:59:05,408 --> 00:59:07,842
不会再发生这样的事了，二级军士长!
Won't happen again, Senior Chief!

818
00:59:08,245 --> 00:59:11,442
你为什么不退出，这样对我们都好
Why don't you do us both a big favor and quit?

819
00:59:12,582 --> 00:59:15,244
我是个救生员，是的，我是
I'm a rescue swimmer, yes, I am

820
00:59:16,019 --> 00:59:18,510
我来这里援救你们离开这该死的地方
I'm here to pull your ass out of this jam

821
00:59:18,588 --> 00:59:21,580
我跳出直升机，带着绳索
I jump from the helo and swing from the cable

822
00:59:22,158 --> 00:59:25,286
我不是泰山，我是心甘情愿的 并且有能力这样做
I'm not Tarzan I'm just willing and able

823
00:59:30,700 --> 00:59:33,260
用其它的来惩罚我吧，二级军士长
Give me something else, Senior Chief.

824
00:59:33,903 --> 00:59:35,165
三十
Thirty!

825
00:59:36,072 --> 00:59:37,471
三十一
Thirty-one!

826
00:59:38,408 --> 00:59:39,568
三十二
Thirty-two!

827
00:59:40,543 --> 00:59:41,532
三十三
Thirty-three!

828
00:59:43,046 --> 00:59:44,343
三十四
Thirty-four!

829
00:59:45,682 --> 00:59:47,081
三十五
Thirty-five!

830
00:59:47,717 --> 00:59:49,082
三十六
Thirty-six!

831
00:59:49,319 --> 00:59:51,082
停下
Stop. Drop them.

832
00:59:51,154 --> 00:59:53,588
二级军士长来了，起立
Senior Chief's on deck. Pop tall.

833
00:59:55,091 --> 00:59:56,558
乌拉
Oorah!

834
00:59:59,629 --> 01:00:00,789
早上好，各位
Morning, class.

835
01:00:00,864 --> 01:00:02,229
今天我们要学的是
Today we were going to learn

836
01:00:02,299 --> 01:00:06,201
怎么在深海靠近生还者
about how to approach a drowning victim in high seas,

837
01:00:08,238 --> 01:00:11,230
但我想这里有人对生还者不感兴趣
but I think there are some here who aren't interested in that victim.

838
01:00:11,308 --> 01:00:12,900
事实上我觉得这个班里有些人
Fact, I think there's some in this class

839
01:00:12,976 --> 01:00:15,945
对援救他人并不感兴趣
who aren't interested in saving lives at all.

840
01:00:16,946 --> 01:00:19,312
我相信有些人
I believe there are some

841
01:00:19,382 --> 01:00:22,351
对于创造记录非常感兴趣
who are more interested in setting records.

842
01:00:22,719 --> 01:00:25,415
那么今天就是记录日
So today is record day.

843
01:00:39,035 --> 01:00:40,935
5：28
5:28.

844
01:00:41,037 --> 01:00:43,335
把金鱼的名字贴上去
Put one on the board for Goldfish.

845
01:00:48,144 --> 01:00:49,975
哇，他还真快
Wow, he's fast.

846
01:00:52,115 --> 01:00:53,912
他很不错
He's good.

847
01:00:58,221 --> 01:01:00,382
你办到了，伙计! 你做到了，费舍尔!
You got it, man! You got it, Fisch!

848
01:01:00,557 --> 01:01:03,924
另一个记录，记下来，军事长
Another record. Chalk it up, Chief.

849
01:01:03,993 --> 01:01:06,553
- 再来点  - 你是真正的男人
- Get some.  - You are the man!

850
01:01:06,629 --> 01:01:09,962
你们其他人都不配和杰克一起在池子里
You people do not deserve to be in the same pool as Jake.

851
01:01:10,033 --> 01:01:11,933
他打败了你们所有人
He's destroying you.

852
01:01:14,471 --> 01:01:17,372
哇，看他游啊，真快
Wow, look at him go! He's fast!

853
01:01:17,540 --> 01:01:19,167
哇，他真快
Wow, he's fast.

854
01:01:19,242 --> 01:01:22,541
快啊，你在挑战记录 暂时只有一个失败者
Come on, you're all fighting for second. Just first loser.

855
01:01:22,612 --> 01:01:23,636
真有趣
This is fun.

856
01:01:23,713 --> 01:01:25,772
待会我们会发奖品
We'll pass out trophies later.

857
01:01:31,721 --> 01:01:33,279
不可思议
Unbelievable.

858
01:01:36,993 --> 01:01:38,483
不可思议
Unbelievable.

859
01:01:41,798 --> 01:01:44,460
要我把这些娘娘腔都赶走吗？
You want me to pull these pansies out?

860
01:01:51,207 --> 01:01:54,665
- 你不会想知道我今天是怎么过的  - 我想知道
- You do not wanna hear about my day.  - Yeah, I do.

861
01:01:57,781 --> 01:01:59,840
那个家伙，朗道
Man, this guy Randall...

862
01:01:59,916 --> 01:02:04,046
他根本不在乎我做的多好 他总是觉得不够好
You know, it doesn't matter what I do. It's just not good enough.

863
01:02:04,120 --> 01:02:06,554
我想他只是希望你变得更好
Well, maybe he's just trying to push you to be better.

864
01:02:06,623 --> 01:02:09,023
你知道，我们老师会鼓励 我们觉得有潜质的学生
You know, we teachers do that to the ones we believe in.

865
01:02:09,092 --> 01:02:11,356
不，他是针对我
No, it's personal with me.

866
01:02:11,995 --> 01:02:14,259
他知道我比他优秀
He knows that I'm better than he was.

867
01:02:14,397 --> 01:02:17,525
我是说，今天我打破了所有他保持的记录
I mean, today, I broke every one of his records.

868
01:02:17,600 --> 01:02:19,500
所有记录都是我的了
I own them all.

869
01:02:19,869 --> 01:02:21,393
并不是所有的
Not all of them.

870
01:02:21,471 --> 01:02:23,962
有一个记录你还没有破
There's one record you won't break.

871
01:02:25,041 --> 01:02:26,736
那是在埃及斯
This is the Aegis.

872
01:02:28,077 --> 01:02:30,272
医疗船支，着火了
Medical ship. Caught on fire.

873
01:02:31,147 --> 01:02:33,638
那真是个梦魇，人们在大火中惊醒
It was a nightmare. People burning in their beds.

874
01:02:33,716 --> 01:02:36,378
本・朗道把所有人都救出来了
And Ben Randall got every one of those people off there,

875
01:02:36,453 --> 01:02:37,886
除了一个人
except for this one guy.

876
01:02:37,954 --> 01:02:40,320
当船开始下沉的时候
And right when the ship started to go down,

877
01:02:40,390 --> 01:02:42,688
他进去找到了这个人
he reaches down and grabs this guy.

878
01:02:42,959 --> 01:02:46,122
当时绞盘卡死了
He's hanging from the cable with this man's life in his hands,

879
01:02:46,196 --> 01:02:47,663
他手上抓住的是那个人的生命
and the winch jams.

880
01:02:47,730 --> 01:02:51,257
在飞回基地的20分钟，那个人一直在尖叫
It's 20 minutes to the base. The man's screaming.

881
01:02:51,701 --> 01:02:54,499
本看着他的眼睛，猜他怎么说？
Ben looks him dead in the eye, and you know what he said?

882
01:02:54,571 --> 01:02:56,300
他说：“我绝不放手”
He said, "I won't let go."

883
01:02:56,372 --> 01:02:57,634
后来呢？
What happened?

884
01:02:57,707 --> 01:03:00,835
他的肩膀脱臼，跟腱全部撕裂
Dislocated his shoulder, tore every tendon in his hand.

885
01:03:00,910 --> 01:03:02,377
但是本没有放手
But he didn't let go.

886
01:03:02,445 --> 01:03:05,312
20分钟，就靠手指拉住缆绳
Twenty minutes, just fingertips.

887
01:03:05,949 --> 01:03:09,146
你如果打破了那个记录，打电话告诉我
You break that record and you give me a call.

888
01:03:23,900 --> 01:03:25,299
我今天过的还算不错
My day was all right.

889
01:04:37,407 --> 01:04:41,241
我想我们应该约会了
So here's my thinking. We should go on a date.

890
01:04:42,712 --> 01:04:44,873
- 好的，那现在我们叫什么来着？  - 不不不
- Well, what do you call this?  - No, no, no.

891
01:04:44,948 --> 01:04:47,143
我是说我想要个真正的约会
I'm talking about, like, a real date.

892
01:04:47,216 --> 01:04:50,708
要有个好餐馆，穿漂亮的衣服
You know, with, like, a nice restaurant, some nice clothes.

893
01:04:50,787 --> 01:04:52,778
我会给你买花
I'll get you some flowers.

894
01:04:52,855 --> 01:04:55,415
我想我们说过这是临时的
I thought we agreed to keep this casual.

895
01:04:55,491 --> 01:04:57,686
只是一块牛排而已
Look, it's one steak. What is...

896
01:04:57,760 --> 01:05:02,959
一块牛排可没有持久的感情纠葛
One steak is not gonna forge some kind of a lasting emotional bond.

897
01:05:04,267 --> 01:05:05,734
我是认真的
I'm serious.

898
01:05:06,102 --> 01:05:07,194
真的吗？
Yeah?

899
01:05:07,270 --> 01:05:09,238
- 是的  - 我也是
- Yeah.  - So am I.

900
01:05:09,305 --> 01:05:11,773
只是一顿晚饭，有什么关系？
It's one dinner. What's it gonna hurt?

901
01:05:11,841 --> 01:05:14,969
好吧，如果你说是一块牛排 我就知道会牵扯到整头牛了
Well, if you ordered a steak, I'd imagine a cow would be involved.

902
01:05:15,044 --> 01:05:18,172
这是什么，纹身吗，2是什么意思？
What do you have, an art gallery over here? What is this "2"?

903
01:05:19,482 --> 01:05:23,145
这让我后面的家伙知道他的位置
It's so the guy behind me knows what place he's coming in.

904
01:05:24,587 --> 01:05:25,713
那这个呢？
What about this one?

905
01:05:25,788 --> 01:05:32,717
这是我高中的队友
That is the initials of the guys on my high school relay team.

906
01:05:33,596 --> 01:05:35,996
酒会之后干的傻事？
A drunken celebration gone wrong?

907
01:05:37,166 --> 01:05:38,963
算是吧
Something like that.

908
01:05:39,569 --> 01:05:42,800
- 那么，我们的约会  - 天啊，只是晚餐，好吗？
- So, about this date.  - God. It's just dinner, right?

909
01:05:42,872 --> 01:05:47,866
不许送花，不能谈论感情问题
No flowers, where we will discuss nothing emotional or important?

910
01:05:49,278 --> 01:05:51,303
我已经完全准备好了
I am fully prepared

911
01:05:51,781 --> 01:05:56,377
当一个小时的芝加哥公牛
to do an entire hour on nothing but the Chicago Bears.

912
01:05:56,853 --> 01:05:59,014
我们可以毫无疑义地做爱
And we can have completely meaningless sex

913
01:05:59,088 --> 01:06:00,988
马上来
immediately afterwards.

914
01:06:01,057 --> 01:06:04,458
你觉得我们第一次约会我就会和你睡吗？
You think I'm gonna sleep with you on our first date?

915
01:06:04,927 --> 01:06:06,394
你说呢
Think again.

916
01:06:08,097 --> 01:06:09,826
你撞到我了
You just head-butted me.

917
01:06:10,099 --> 01:06:12,465
我来教你蛙泳
I'm gonna teach you the breaststroke.

918
01:06:12,535 --> 01:06:17,234
这可复杂了，和蝶泳可不一样
It's pretty complicated, different than that of the butterfly.

919
01:06:21,177 --> 01:06:24,578
我想我睡不着了
I guess I can't sleep.

920
01:06:26,883 --> 01:06:28,874
当然了
Well, of course you can't.

921
01:06:30,186 --> 01:06:32,381
妻子离开你，好友过世
Your wife left you. Your best friend died.

922
01:06:32,455 --> 01:06:34,446
听起来想首该死的乡村音乐
You sound like a damn country song.

923
01:06:34,524 --> 01:06:37,220
如果你有条狗，他现在也会跑开了
If you had a dog, he'd be run over by now.

924
01:06:37,293 --> 01:06:40,126
- 她把离婚书给你了吗？  - 是的
- So, did she send you papers?  - Yeah.

925
01:06:40,463 --> 01:06:41,953
你读了吗？
And did you read them?

926
01:06:43,966 --> 01:06:44,955
不，没有
No, I did not.

927
01:06:45,668 --> 01:06:48,193
好吧，你想过怎么办吗？
Well, you think you might ought to?

928
01:06:54,811 --> 01:06:57,075
你知道，不可能有其它人了
You know, there never was anyone else, Mags.

929
01:06:57,146 --> 01:06:58,738
算了吧，本
Like hell, Ben.

930
01:07:00,149 --> 01:07:01,844
你是个大人物
You're a bigamist.

931
01:07:02,618 --> 01:07:05,018
你已经嫁给海岸警卫队了
You been married to the Coast Guard all along.

932
01:07:05,088 --> 01:07:06,988
肩膀靠过来点
Give me that shoulder.

933
01:07:07,490 --> 01:07:12,052
你还在游只是想证明你还是19岁
You probably swum it out of socket trying to prove you're still 19.

934
01:07:12,695 --> 01:07:14,162
对吗？
Am I right?

935
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,195
我们是什么时候变老的？
When the heck did we get old?

936
01:07:20,269 --> 01:07:22,533
我们一直在变老，本
Hell, I've always been old, Ben.

937
01:07:22,605 --> 01:07:24,436
你知道吗，我不在乎
You know what, though? I don't mind.

938
01:07:24,507 --> 01:07:27,169
我是说，如果肌肉酸痛了 说明我们已经使用过了
I mean, if my muscles ache, it's 'cause I've used them.

939
01:07:27,243 --> 01:07:29,404
如果我现在走不动路
If it's hard for me to walk up them steps now,

940
01:07:29,479 --> 01:07:34,246
那是因为每晚我都走到爱我的人那去
it's 'cause I walked up them every night to lay next to a man who loved me.

941
01:07:34,317 --> 01:07:35,807
我这里满是皱纹
I got a few wrinkles here and there,

942
01:07:35,885 --> 01:07:40,584
因为我经历了无数快乐的日子
but I've laid under thousands of skies on sunny days, yeah.

943
01:07:41,758 --> 01:07:46,218
我在享受生命，我喝酒，抽烟
I look and feel this way, well, 'cause I drank and I smoked,

944
01:07:46,295 --> 01:07:50,061
我生活，爱怜，跳舞，歌唱，流汗
I lived and I loved, and danced, sang, sweat

945
01:07:50,133 --> 01:07:53,625
用自己的方式享受生活
and screwed my way through a pretty damned good life,

946
01:07:53,770 --> 01:07:55,362
如果你问我
if you ask me.

947
01:07:55,471 --> 01:07:57,530
变老不是坏事，本
Getting old ain't bad, Ben.

948
01:07:57,607 --> 01:07:59,700
变老是收获
Getting old, that's earned.

949
01:08:33,576 --> 01:08:35,976
有一天你必须决定
There will come a time when you might have to decide

950
01:08:36,045 --> 01:08:37,910
谁活下来谁死去
who lives and dies out there.

951
01:08:39,448 --> 01:08:40,847
这可不是好差事
It's a terrible responsibility,

952
01:08:41,122 --> 01:08:44,455
但这是你作为救生员必须学会做的
But it is one you will have to make as a rescue swimmer.

953
01:08:47,628 --> 01:08:49,027
事实上
The bigger reality is,

954
01:08:50,264 --> 01:08:52,824
这是你作为一个人
it's also something you're going to have to live with

955
01:08:52,933 --> 01:08:54,264
一定会遇到的情况
as a human being.

956
01:08:57,705 --> 01:09:01,698
你一定会碰到说不的时候
There will come a time when you're going to have to say no.

957
01:09:02,810 --> 01:09:06,974
最重要的是保证自己能活着
The most important person to keep alive is yourself.

958
01:09:07,982 --> 01:09:13,943
你会面对5到20个船员对你说“救我救我”
You'll be facing crews from five to 20, all saying, "Save me, save me."

959
01:09:14,021 --> 01:09:15,955
他们在等待奇迹
They're looking for a miracle.

960
01:09:17,124 --> 01:09:19,922
- 你多大了，霍吉？
- 24  - How old are you, Hodge?  - Twenty-four.

961
01:09:20,227 --> 01:09:23,594
在24岁的年纪，你必须成为那个奇迹
At 24 years old, you have to become that miracle.

962
01:09:23,898 --> 01:09:27,197
你得找到成为奇迹的办法
You have to find a way to be that miracle.

963
01:09:31,105 --> 01:09:34,006
向右看，向前看，向左看
Looking right, looking center, looking left.

964
01:09:34,809 --> 01:09:36,037
乌拉
Oorah!

965
01:09:43,184 --> 01:09:46,415
先生你还好吗？我是海岸警卫队救生员
You okay, sir? I'm a rescue swimmer.

966
01:09:56,997 --> 01:09:58,157
再来一次
Again.

967
01:10:20,788 --> 01:10:22,722
好吧，就这样 休息一下
All right, that's it. Time-out.

968
01:10:22,790 --> 01:10:25,987
- 他每次都很慌张，军士长  - 霍吉, 过来
- Panics every time, Senior.  - Hodge, over here.

969
01:10:29,997 --> 01:10:31,055
嘿
Hey.

970
01:10:35,769 --> 01:10:37,896
你和生还者唯一的区别
The only difference between you and the victim

971
01:10:37,972 --> 01:10:40,805
是你们在水里的态度
is the attitude in which you enter the water.

972
01:10:40,875 --> 01:10:42,809
你得找到面对混乱
You've gotta figure out a way to be calm

973
01:10:42,877 --> 01:10:45,607
冷静下来的办法 明白吗？
in the face of chaos. Do you understand?

974
01:10:48,849 --> 01:10:51,477
这是你的第一次失败，查理
That's your first challenge, Charlie.

975
01:10:51,952 --> 01:10:54,284
再多一次你就走人
One more and you're gone.

976
01:10:57,024 --> 01:11:00,187
- 出来  - 是，二级军士长
- Come out.  - Aye, aye, Senior Chief.

977
01:11:05,366 --> 01:11:07,163
怎么了，费舍尔？
What's up, Big Fisch?

978
01:11:15,709 --> 01:11:18,405
你不必听他的，霍吉
You don't have to take his shit, Hodge.

979
01:11:19,146 --> 01:11:22,309
你知道么，这对你来说太容易了，费舍尔
What do you know? It's so easy for you, Fischer.

980
01:11:22,783 --> 01:11:23,841
是这样吗？
Is that right?

981
01:11:25,252 --> 01:11:26,241
没错
Yeah.

982
01:11:27,288 --> 01:11:28,778
知道吗，你还是没有搞清楚
You know, you don't get it.

983
01:11:30,090 --> 01:11:32,650
你不知道你比我坚强多了
You don't realize that you're tougher than I am.

984
01:11:32,726 --> 01:11:33,886
为什么？
And how's that?

985
01:11:33,961 --> 01:11:36,862
如果我被踢出去了，我可不会回来
Well, if I get kicked out of here, I'm not coming back.

986
01:11:36,931 --> 01:11:39,263
我绝对不会再次回来
I'm definitely not coming back twice.

987
01:11:39,333 --> 01:11:41,096
我是说，你是个坚毅的家伙
I mean, you got guts, man.

988
01:11:41,168 --> 01:11:42,499
是愚蠢
Stupidity.

989
01:11:43,337 --> 01:11:45,464
你来了多久了，伙计？
How long you been here, man?

990
01:11:47,208 --> 01:11:50,143
总共…不知道，第一次10周
Altogether... I don't know, 10 weeks the first time,

991
01:11:50,211 --> 01:11:54,113
- 第二次6周零2天  - 这次是6周
- six weeks, two days the second time...  - Six weeks this time.

992
01:11:54,181 --> 01:11:55,341
所以，你来这儿的时间
So basically, you've been here

993
01:11:55,416 --> 01:11:57,748
比任何一个从这里毕业的人都要久了
longer than anybody that's graduated this place,

994
01:11:57,818 --> 01:11:59,683
但你还不觉得你能毕业
but you don't think you can make it.

995
01:12:02,556 --> 01:12:04,683
打起精神来，伙计
Lighten up on yourself, man.

996
01:12:05,359 --> 01:12:06,883
走吧 我们去喝几杯
Let's go. Let's get a beer.

997
01:12:07,861 --> 01:12:11,262
嘿，等等 你不是 和婚礼上遇到的女孩有约吗？
Hey, wait. Don't you have a date with the girl from the wedding?

998
01:12:11,665 --> 01:12:16,125
是的，但现在还没到9:00 还有时间 把衣服穿上
Yeah, but it's not till 9:00. We got time. Get dressed.

999
01:12:18,906 --> 01:12:20,203
我们走
Let's go.

1000
01:12:21,342 --> 01:12:23,674
当你被往下拽的时候
When you go under, when you're pulling on your stroke,

1001
01:12:23,744 --> 01:12:26,372
- 移动你的手臂  - 等等，我们去哪里？
- move your hand...  - Wait a minute. Where are we going?

1002
01:12:28,048 --> 01:12:31,381
杰克，这是乌贼酒吧 是海军的地头
Jake, that's a squid bar. I mean, there's Navy guys everywhere.

1003
01:12:31,452 --> 01:12:32,976
我才不管呢，我们只是喝瓶酒而已
I don't give a shit. A beer's a beer.

1004
01:12:33,053 --> 01:12:36,352
你被拖下水的时候，你必须把自己弄出来
When you're pulling through the water, you're gonna pull yourself through.

1005
01:12:37,057 --> 01:12:38,456
- 就像，你知道  - 我得迅速
- Like, you know...  - So I'll go fast.

1006
01:12:38,525 --> 01:12:40,959
不，你得侧身摆脱，就像这样
No, you wanna lay to your side and pull it like that.

1007
01:12:45,966 --> 01:12:48,161
嘿，查理 把那些衣服换掉
Hey, Charlie, you get those fittings replaced

1008
01:12:48,235 --> 01:12:50,635
- 在你喝醉之前好吗？  - 是，长官
- before you came off to get tanked up?  - Yes, sir, Captain.

1009
01:12:50,704 --> 01:12:53,070
是的，我亲眼看到才相信
Yeah, I'll believe that when I see it.

1010
01:12:53,140 --> 01:12:54,300
我们去“A”学校
We go to "A" School,

1011
01:12:54,375 --> 01:12:56,969
这是军队里门槛最高的学校
which is the most difficult school in the military.

1012
01:12:57,044 --> 01:12:59,842
那儿的淘汰率是，50%吗？
The attrition rate's, like... What is it, 50%?

1013
01:12:59,913 --> 01:13:00,902
50%
50%.

1014
01:13:00,981 --> 01:13:02,710
- 超过50%  - 超过50
- It's over 50%.  - Over 50.

1015
01:13:02,783 --> 01:13:05,411
我们还在这里，因为我们是精英中的精英
We're still here, 'cause we're the best of the best.

1016
01:13:06,220 --> 01:13:10,179
当暴风来了港口关闭，知道谁出任务吗？
When storms shut down entire ports, you know who goes out?

1017
01:13:10,724 --> 01:13:12,021
是我们
We do.

1018
01:13:12,092 --> 01:13:14,686
当飓风…当飓风让海军不能动弹时
When hurricanes... When hurricanes ground the US Navy,

1019
01:13:14,762 --> 01:13:18,391
就像那边的小孩子一样 猜猜谁会出任务？
like these little guys over here, guess who goes out?

1020
01:13:18,465 --> 01:13:19,989
没错，是我们
That's right, we do.

1021
01:13:20,067 --> 01:13:22,763
听着，亲爱的，你得小声点，好吗？
Look, honey, you better keep it down in here, okay?

1022
01:13:22,836 --> 01:13:24,770
好的，亲爱的 她叫我“亲爱的”
Okay, honey. She called me "honey."

1023
01:13:26,340 --> 01:13:27,534
好的，亲爱的
Okay, honey.

1024
01:13:27,608 --> 01:13:30,600
当上帝从天而降
But when God himself reaches down from heaven...

1025
01:13:31,312 --> 01:13:34,179
- 他会怎么做，杰克，当他…  - 把房子从地上撕裂
- What does he do, Jake, when he...  - Rips houses off the foundation.

1026
01:13:34,248 --> 01:13:37,615
当上帝把房子从地上撕裂，我们出任务
When God himself rips houses off the foundation, we go out,

1027
01:13:37,685 --> 01:13:39,380
因为我们是救生员
because we are rescue swimmers,

1028
01:13:39,453 --> 01:13:42,047
这是我们的工作，我们干的就是这个
and that is our job, and that's what we do.

1029
01:13:42,122 --> 01:13:44,249
你应该重新检查一下罗盘
You might wanna recheck your compass.

1030
01:13:44,325 --> 01:13:46,725
这里可不是什么烂海盗来的酒吧
This ain't no puddle pirate bar.

1031
01:13:55,402 --> 01:13:58,235
没问题，我们马上就走
No problem, because we were just leaving anyway.

1032
01:13:58,305 --> 01:13:59,966
- 坐下，霍吉  - 杰克
- Sit down, Hodge.  - Jake.

1033
01:14:00,040 --> 01:14:01,735
- 把酒喝完  - 杰克
- Finish your beer.  - Jake.

1034
01:14:01,809 --> 01:14:03,436
对，坐下，霍吉
Yeah, sit, Hodge.

1035
01:14:04,111 --> 01:14:05,874
伙计，这是我的啤酒
That's my beer, man.

1036
01:14:10,884 --> 01:14:12,351
喝完了吗？
Finished now?

1037
01:14:14,088 --> 01:14:15,953
祝你愉快
Must be happy hour.

1038
01:14:20,961 --> 01:14:21,950
嘿！
Hey!

1039
01:14:23,464 --> 01:14:24,488
后退
Back off.

1040
01:14:27,067 --> 01:14:29,558
来这里的都是退休海军
Everyone in this place is retired Navy.

1041
01:14:29,636 --> 01:14:32,366
嘿，嘿 我什么时候才能用电话？
Hey. Hey, when do I get that phone call?

1042
01:14:33,006 --> 01:14:36,464
我知道我有权力打电话 什么时候给我电话打？
I know I get a phone call. When do I get my phone call?

1043
01:14:41,749 --> 01:14:43,273
女士，非常抱歉
Ma'am, I am sorry,

1044
01:14:43,350 --> 01:14:45,978
如果20分钟没人来，我可要把桌子给别人了
but if nobody come in 20 minutes, I need the table.

1045
01:14:46,353 --> 01:14:47,411
- 好的  - 对不起
- Okay.  - I'm sorry.

1046
01:14:47,488 --> 01:14:48,580
好吧
Yeah.

1047
01:14:52,960 --> 01:14:54,894
她再也不会和我说话了
She's never gonna talk to me again.

1048
01:14:55,829 --> 01:14:58,229
你知道他们会把我们踢出去的，对吗？
You know they're gonna kick us out for this, right?

1049
01:14:58,298 --> 01:14:59,458
是的
Yep.

1050
01:15:03,670 --> 01:15:05,900
至少他们不会说我们是自己退出的
Least they can't say we quit.

1051
01:15:06,974 --> 01:15:11,240
我办不到的 长官说的对，每次我都紧张
I was never gonna make it, anyway. Skinner's right. Panic every time.

1052
01:15:12,613 --> 01:15:14,444
伙计，别管长官怎么说
Man, screw Skinner.

1053
01:15:15,883 --> 01:15:17,714
我是长官，来挣脱我
I'm Skinner. Break my hold.

1054
01:15:17,785 --> 01:15:20,276
嘿，伙计，你在做什么？ 来吧，费舍尔，放开我
Hey, what are you doing, man? Come on, Fischer, get off me.

1055
01:15:20,354 --> 01:15:21,616
时间有限，快点挣脱我
Clock's ticking. Break it.

1056
01:15:21,688 --> 01:15:24,919
费舍尔，你弄伤我了 费舍尔，放开我，伙计!
Fischer, you're hurting me, man. Fischer, get off me, man!

1057
01:15:25,926 --> 01:15:28,588
快点，费舍尔，你弄伤我了 费舍尔，放开！
Come on, Fischer, you're hurting me. Fischer, man, get off!

1058
01:15:28,662 --> 01:15:30,687
- 快他妈的挣脱我  - 费舍尔，放开我!
- Break the goddamn hold.  - Fischer, get off me, man!

1059
01:15:30,764 --> 01:15:33,358
- 快挣脱，霍吉  - 费舍尔，放开我!
- Break the goddamn hold, Hodge.  - Fischer, get off me!

1060
01:15:34,868 --> 01:15:36,529
我说，放开我!
I said, get off me!

1061
01:15:37,004 --> 01:15:38,198
好吧
All right.

1062
01:15:38,472 --> 01:15:41,669
你在水里的时候就该这样
Now, it's just like that when you're in the water.

1063
01:15:44,645 --> 01:15:47,705
好了，现在我们可以走了
Well, now. We could come back.

1064
01:15:48,182 --> 01:15:51,549
给你们点时间抽抽烟，说说枕边话什么的
Give you boys time for a smoke and some pillow talk.

1065
01:15:59,593 --> 01:16:00,855
你不能把我们踢出去
You can't kick us out.

1066
01:16:00,928 --> 01:16:03,055
这叫不守纪律，我们可以把你们踢了
It's called disorderly conduct, and yes, we can.

1067
01:16:03,130 --> 01:16:05,758
- 我们没有不及格  - 我们的专业包括遵守纪律
- We didn't fail at nothing.  - Our profession is all about control.

1068
01:16:05,833 --> 01:16:07,562
你们这方面都不及格
You both failed miserably in that department.

1069
01:16:07,634 --> 01:16:09,431
站在这里
Hold it right there.

1070
01:16:09,503 --> 01:16:11,300
- 军士长？  - 进来吧
- Senior?  - Yeah, come in.

1071
01:16:14,074 --> 01:16:16,201
他们的开除报告
Their disenrollment records.

1072
01:16:18,011 --> 01:16:19,342
酒吧斗殴？
Bar fight?

1073
01:16:20,848 --> 01:16:22,975
- 好了，带他们进来  - 军士长
- All right, bring them in.  - Senior.

1074
01:16:23,083 --> 01:16:24,414
进来吧
Square it.

1075
01:16:31,225 --> 01:16:34,422
这都是我的错，二级军事长 霍吉和这无关
It's all my fault, Senior Chief. Hodge had nothing to do with it.

1076
01:16:36,196 --> 01:16:38,391
- 是这样吗，霍吉？  - 没错
- That true, Hodge?  - It's true.

1077
01:16:42,302 --> 01:16:44,998
好吧，你解散吧
All right. Fine, you're dismissed.

1078
01:16:45,472 --> 01:16:49,431
- 二级军士长，我  - 我说了你已经解散了
- Senior Chief, I was...  - I said that you are dismissed.

1079
01:16:50,310 --> 01:16:51,572
走吧
Let's go.

1080
01:16:58,685 --> 01:17:01,415
因为我捍卫了海岸警卫队的尊严 你就要踢我走人吗？
You're gonna kick me out for defending the Coast Guard?

1081
01:17:01,889 --> 01:17:03,982
海岸警卫队有200年历史
The Coast Guard's been around for 200 years.

1082
01:17:04,057 --> 01:17:07,390
我想只有你这样的傻冒 会这样维护它的尊严
I doubt a couple of knuckleheads like yourself are gonna defend it.

1083
01:17:07,761 --> 01:17:08,989
坐下
Sit down.

1084
01:17:12,499 --> 01:17:16,094
我想和你平静下来平等地谈谈，但是
I've been trying to peel the layers back on you for a while now, and I...

1085
01:17:16,403 --> 01:17:17,631
我有一点不明白
I just don't get it.

1086
01:17:19,139 --> 01:17:21,232
我是说，这工作对于你这样的人来说
I mean, this kind of work seems a little remedial

1087
01:17:21,308 --> 01:17:22,332
似乎只是一种疗伤
for someone like yourself.

1088
01:17:22,409 --> 01:17:24,809
你知道，游泳冠军 常春藤每一个学校的奖学金
You know, big swim champ, offer to every lvy League.

1089
01:17:24,878 --> 01:17:27,540
你放弃一切到这和我们在一起
You give it all up to be here with us.

1090
01:17:28,815 --> 01:17:32,307
- 为什么？  - 我是为了拯救生命，二级军士长
- Why?  - I'm here to save lives, Senior Chief.

1091
01:17:36,623 --> 01:17:38,853
我和你的教练谈过了，杰克
I spoke with your coach, Jake.

1092
01:17:41,061 --> 01:17:43,529
- 好我的教练谈？  - 是的，我和你的教练谈了
- You spoke with my coach?  - Yeah, I spoke with your coach.

1093
01:17:43,597 --> 01:17:46,964
你的档案里有些东西让我很牵挂
Something in your file just kept hanging me up.

1094
01:17:47,034 --> 01:17:50,492
你第一年和第二年连续获得州里的冠军
You win the state championship your freshman and sophomore year

1095
01:17:50,571 --> 01:17:53,233
但后两年你没再去游
and then you don't swim the next two.

1096
01:17:53,507 --> 01:17:56,943
我只是个公立学校毕业的家伙
I'm just a public school guy, so pardon me,

1097
01:17:57,010 --> 01:18:00,776
我一直没有意识到，直到看到这些
but it didn't add up until now.

1098
01:18:06,987 --> 01:18:10,184
“科科・霍里华，100米混合泳冠军”
"Kirk Holloway, 100-meter medley winner,

1099
01:18:11,024 --> 01:18:13,492
“从车窗里甩了出去”
"thrown through the passenger window.

1100
01:18:13,560 --> 01:18:15,858
“当场死亡”
"Pronounced dead at the scene.

1101
01:18:17,364 --> 01:18:22,324
“艾比・科曼，美国1队，肺穿孔”
"Abe lkeman, first team All-American, lungs crushed.

1102
01:18:25,372 --> 01:18:29,331
“卡尔・山多夫，50米自由泳冠军”
"Carl Sandoval, 50-meter freestyle champ,

1103
01:18:29,409 --> 01:18:34,039
“送往医院的途中死于内出血”
"made it all the way to the hospital. Died of internal bleeding."

1104
01:18:43,590 --> 01:18:46,320
我想你都知道了
I guess you just know everything, then.

1105
01:18:47,160 --> 01:18:49,754
我知道失去队友是什么样的
I know what it's like to lose a team.

1106
01:18:51,198 --> 01:18:52,324
是吗
Yeah?

1107
01:18:52,599 --> 01:18:53,998
生活在一个小镇上
What about living in a small town

1108
01:18:54,067 --> 01:18:56,194
别人认为他杀了自己的兄弟
where everyone thinks that you killed their brother

1109
01:18:56,269 --> 01:18:57,827
儿子或是最好的朋友，会是什么感觉？
or their son or their best friend?

1110
01:18:57,904 --> 01:18:59,303
你知道那是什么感觉吗？
You know about that?

1111
01:19:00,240 --> 01:19:03,676
看来小镇上的人相互之间打招呼
Kind of small town where everyone still waves to everyone,

1112
01:19:04,911 --> 01:19:06,503
但不和你打招呼？
just not to you?

1113
01:19:08,915 --> 01:19:12,817
我读了报告，杰克 当时你的酒精含量为零
I read the report, Jake. Your blood alcohol was zip that night.

1114
01:19:13,854 --> 01:19:16,982
我猜是另一个冒失的司机开的车
I'm guessing there was a flip for designated driver.

1115
01:19:17,057 --> 01:19:18,354
你却被错怪
You lost.

1116
01:19:19,393 --> 01:19:21,486
猜猜就能解决问题？
Guess that just makes it all go away, huh?

1117
01:19:21,561 --> 01:19:24,792
不，没有解决任何问题 这只是一场意外
No, it doesn't make it all right. It just makes it an accident.

1118
01:19:25,298 --> 01:19:27,323
至少报告上这样说
At least that's how it reads.

1119
01:19:28,669 --> 01:19:30,330
那时你才16岁，杰克
You were 16 years old, Jake.

1120
01:19:30,404 --> 01:19:32,929
我不是你的牧师，但如果我是，我想
I'm not your priest, but if I was, I think...

1121
01:19:33,407 --> 01:19:35,500
我想我不会为难你
I think maybe you'd deserve a pass.

1122
01:19:39,046 --> 01:19:41,071
不为难我？
You're giving me a pass?

1123
01:19:41,248 --> 01:19:45,378
你以为你知道所有事 其实你什么都不是
You just think you know everything with your psychobabble bullshit.

1124
01:19:45,452 --> 01:19:47,477
为什么我在这里？为什么你在这里？
Why am I here? Why are you here?

1125
01:19:48,889 --> 01:19:51,585
你太老了只能干这个，你已经快不行了
You're too old to be doing this. You're washed-up here.

1126
01:19:51,658 --> 01:19:55,219
你可不想在池子里教小孩，我说的对吗？
You don't wanna be teaching a bunch of kids in a pool. Am I right?

1127
01:19:55,295 --> 01:19:58,696
我不在乎你看了什么说了什么
I don't give a shit what you read or who you talked to.

1128
01:19:58,765 --> 01:20:02,701
你根本不了解我，你不… 我能管好我自己
You don't know about me! You don't... I have me under control.

1129
01:20:07,240 --> 01:20:08,764
我能看出来
I can see that.

1130
01:20:27,894 --> 01:20:30,658
我和你唯一的区别是
The only difference between you and me is,

1131
01:20:32,199 --> 01:20:35,362
我没有帮在我手上 死去的人穿上衣服，杰克
I don't wear the ones I lost on my arm, Jake.

1132
01:20:43,810 --> 01:20:46,040
我知道你的处境，杰克
I know where you're at, Jake.

1133
01:20:46,947 --> 01:20:48,642
我也在那儿
I'm there myself.

1134
01:20:50,884 --> 01:20:54,411
每天我都会问自己 为什么我是幸存下来的那个人
I ask myself every day why I was the one that survived.

1135
01:20:59,726 --> 01:21:01,956
- 然后？  - 然后
- And?  - And...

1136
01:21:04,765 --> 01:21:06,289
如果我回答不了自己
And if I can't answer that for me,

1137
01:21:06,366 --> 01:21:09,767
我没办法试着向你解释
I'm certainly not going to try and answer it for you.

1138
01:21:14,574 --> 01:21:15,973
坐下
Have a seat.

1139
01:21:22,415 --> 01:21:25,543
我想让你成为其中一员
I want you to start being a member of this team,

1140
01:21:26,753 --> 01:21:28,618
你知道我指的是什么
the team you have now.

1141
01:21:29,890 --> 01:21:31,790
你很有天赋，杰克
You have a gift, Jake.

1142
01:21:32,159 --> 01:21:34,218
你是到这里来的最棒的队员
You're the best swimmer to come through this program,

1143
01:21:34,294 --> 01:21:35,488
不用很久，你能轻松通过的
hands down, by far.

1144
01:21:35,562 --> 01:21:37,496
你有整个纪录板去证明
You got a whole record board to prove it.

1145
01:21:37,564 --> 01:21:40,260
你知道我看到了什么吗？
But you know what I see when I look at it?

1146
01:21:40,333 --> 01:21:43,791
我看到有人足够快能够 第一个游到幸存者身边
I see someone fast enough who's gonna get there first.

1147
01:21:45,005 --> 01:21:47,132
我看到有人足够强壮能够支撑到最后
I see someone strong enough who's gonna last.

1148
01:21:47,207 --> 01:21:51,906
我看到有人能拯救别人救不了的人
I see someone who can save a life that maybe nobody else could.

1149
01:21:54,247 --> 01:21:57,375
你想以你的双手创造荣耀吗？
You really wanna honor the initials on your arm?

1150
01:21:58,685 --> 01:22:00,516
那就好好利用你的天赋吧
Then honor your gift.

1151
01:22:03,490 --> 01:22:05,617
救每一个你能救到的人，杰克
Save the ones you can, Jake.

1152
01:22:07,060 --> 01:22:10,427
其余的，我们得学会放手
The rest, we've gotta let go.

1153
01:22:21,241 --> 01:22:23,368
你是说你不会开除我？
Does this mean you're not gonna fail me?

1154
01:22:24,177 --> 01:22:27,943
为什么，就为了在酒吧帮助伙伴？
For what, backing up a buddy in a bar?

1155
01:22:30,851 --> 01:22:33,376
伙计，比起你我可有过更大的麻烦
Man, I got bigger problems than you.

1156
01:22:36,623 --> 01:22:40,150
我不知道你，要是我 我他妈的可要操起酒瓶子揍他了
I don't know about you, but I could use a fucking drink.

1157
01:22:44,998 --> 01:22:46,124
喔
Oops.

1158
01:22:48,635 --> 01:22:52,503
我今天晚上都在考虑纪录和责任之外的事
I'm gonna consider everything tonight off-record and off-duty.

1159
01:22:56,309 --> 01:22:57,469
这个是个邀请
That was an invite.

1160
01:22:58,278 --> 01:22:59,267
哦
Oh.

1161
01:23:03,617 --> 01:23:05,585
你一定是开玩笑
You gotta be kidding me.

1162
01:23:06,186 --> 01:23:09,883
- 他们是怎么称呼你的？  - “烂海盗”，这不是…
- What was it they called you?  - "Puddle pirates," but it's not...

1163
01:23:09,956 --> 01:23:13,687
别去了，军士长
I'm way over it, Senior Chief. This is...

1164
01:23:14,160 --> 01:23:17,527
- 好吧，看上去可不友善啊  - 我们就喝一杯酒
- Well, it's like sticks and stones.  - Well, we'll just have one beer.

1165
01:23:23,904 --> 01:23:27,772
很好，他们喝的烂醉
Great. They're angrier and drunker. Perfect.

1166
01:23:27,841 --> 01:23:30,241
嗨，2杯啤酒
Hi. Two beers.

1167
01:23:31,244 --> 01:23:33,872
- 你在开玩笑吧  - 我就是这么说的
- You gotta be kidding me.  - That's what I said.

1168
01:23:34,781 --> 01:23:37,409
听着，别给我惹事，明白吗？
Look, I don't want any trouble, okay?

1169
01:23:40,387 --> 01:23:42,821
他们都不喜欢我们，对吗？
They really don't like us, do they?

1170
01:23:42,889 --> 01:23:47,326
不 他们觉得比我们优秀 因为他们是打仗的
No. They think they're better than us because they're combat-oriented.

1171
01:23:48,495 --> 01:23:50,622
我们是海岸警卫队，杰克
We're the Coast Guard, Jake.

1172
01:23:50,730 --> 01:23:53,893
没有人会赏识我们，除非他们需要我们
Nobody really appreciates us until they need us.

1173
01:23:56,436 --> 01:23:57,698
是他吗？
That him?

1174
01:24:05,645 --> 01:24:06,703
是的
Yep.

1175
01:24:12,118 --> 01:24:15,451
在我们开始流血之前我先问你个问题
So let me ask you a question before we start bleeding.

1176
01:24:17,123 --> 01:24:21,150
你救的那么多人…具体数字是多少？
All those saves... What's your real number?

1177
01:24:28,101 --> 01:24:31,468
你是想死呢还是傻的可以？
Do you have a death wish, or are you just shit-stupid?

1178
01:24:32,806 --> 01:24:35,297
算是犯傻劲吧
I'm gonna go with stupid this time.

1179
01:24:35,375 --> 01:24:37,240
- 嗨  - 嗨
- Hi.  - Hi.

1180
01:24:37,310 --> 01:24:39,369
这是谁？你老子？
Who's this, your old man?

1181
01:24:45,452 --> 01:24:47,886
瞧，我很高兴你还在这儿
You know, I'm really glad you're still here.

1182
01:24:47,954 --> 01:24:49,615
- 喔，是吗？  - 是的
- Oh, yeah?  - Yeah.

1183
01:24:57,964 --> 01:25:00,694
- 小心后面  - 退下!我说退下
- Behind you.  - Stand down! I said stand down.

1184
01:25:07,874 --> 01:25:09,865
我想你们最好快离开
I think you better leave.

1185
01:25:12,846 --> 01:25:13,938
好吧
Okay.

1186
01:25:16,416 --> 01:25:17,906
走吧，杰克
Come on, Jake.

1187
01:25:24,524 --> 01:25:26,924
好吧 坐下，喝杯酒
All right, sit down. Have a beer.

1188
01:25:27,994 --> 01:25:30,622
- 这比我想象中的好的多了  - 是的
- That went a lot better than I thought.  - Yeah.

1189
01:25:31,398 --> 01:25:34,424
- 那是什么？  - 我不知道
- What the hell was that?  - I don't know.

1190
01:25:34,968 --> 01:25:38,768
嘿，我得向你道歉
Hey, I wanted to apologize to you

1191
01:25:40,106 --> 01:25:43,234
说你太老了什么的
for what I said earlier about you being old and washed-up now.

1192
01:25:45,845 --> 01:25:49,246
你有什么要对我说的吗？
Is there anything you'd like to say to me?

1193
01:25:49,616 --> 01:25:50,640
比方说？
Like what?

1194
01:25:51,751 --> 01:25:53,719
我不知道，但我对你道歉了
I don't know, but I apologized to you.

1195
01:25:53,787 --> 01:25:55,550
我只是觉得，你知道
I just thought that, you know,

1196
01:25:55,622 --> 01:25:57,852
你以前可能说过些什么
there might be something you've said or done

1197
01:25:57,924 --> 01:25:59,892
那些你可以向我道歉的
that you'd like to apologize to me for.

1198
01:25:59,959 --> 01:26:01,017
为什么？
Why?

1199
01:26:02,729 --> 01:26:04,924
因为就该是这样的，我…
'Cause that's how it's done. I...

1200
01:26:05,298 --> 01:26:07,596
你知道吗，你真是太不会道歉了
You suck at apologies, you know that?

1201
01:26:07,700 --> 01:26:09,691
我是说你都没弄明白什么是道歉
I mean, you're missing the whole concept.

1202
01:26:20,547 --> 01:26:23,744
- 喂你好？  - 嗨，是我
Hello?  - JAKE: Hi. It's me.

1203
01:26:26,252 --> 01:26:29,813
你还好吗？发生什么了？我等了你2个小时
Are you okay? What happened? I mean, I waited for two hours.

1204
01:26:30,123 --> 01:26:34,253
嗯 听着，这很复杂
Yeah. No. Look, I'm really sorry. I...

1205
01:26:34,828 --> 01:26:36,022
怎么了？
What happened?

1206
01:26:36,129 --> 01:26:38,893
真的要说很久了
It's a really long story.

1207
01:26:40,433 --> 01:26:43,994
让我…这样说吧
Let me just... Let me put it this way.

1208
01:26:45,171 --> 01:26:49,835
这是我这辈子最好也是最坏的一天
It was the best worst night of my life.

1209
01:26:51,077 --> 01:26:52,874
好吧，我很高兴有人找到乐子了
Well, I'm glad someone had fun.

1210
01:26:58,218 --> 01:27:01,085
明天能见你吗？
Can I see you tomorrow night?

1211
01:27:01,488 --> 01:27:03,752
明天有家长会
I have parent-teacher conferences tomorrow.

1212
01:27:04,757 --> 01:27:06,384
那后天呢？
What about the next night?

1213
01:27:06,993 --> 01:27:09,154
我一周都有家长会
I have parent-teacher conferences all week.

1214
01:27:10,563 --> 01:27:13,555
- 你要甩了我吗？  - 不，杰克
You blowing me off?  - EMILY: No, Jake.

1215
01:27:14,767 --> 01:27:16,462
我不会这样做的
I wouldn't do that to somebody.

1216
01:27:18,571 --> 01:27:21,506
再过几个小时我得出发了 我要睡了
I gotta get up in a couple hours. I gotta go.

1217
01:27:21,674 --> 01:27:24,643
- 好的  - 再见
- Yep.  - Goodbye.

1218
01:27:35,188 --> 01:27:37,452
好了，你们还都记得该怎么做吧
All right, you know what we briefed on the ground.

1219
01:27:37,524 --> 01:27:40,152
和以前一样，我们要一起行动
Same thing. We're gonna stay together.

1220
01:27:40,226 --> 01:27:44,094
无论发生了什么事，你们要一起行动
No matter what happens out there, you stay together.

1221
01:27:44,531 --> 01:27:49,195
无论要做什么决定，一起行动
Whatever decision you make, you make as a team.

1222
01:27:52,272 --> 01:27:55,435
我们训练时从15到20英尺跳下去
We trained to freefall at 15 to 20 feet.

1223
01:27:56,075 --> 01:27:59,408
从50尺跳下去，就像跳进混凝土
You fall from 50 feet, it's like hitting concrete.

1224
01:27:59,812 --> 01:28:03,612
从80到100尺跳下去，你就没命了
You fall 80 to 100 feet, you die.

1225
01:28:10,723 --> 01:28:12,122
嘿，他们走了？
Hey, where they going?

1226
01:28:12,192 --> 01:28:13,887
他们会回来的，对吗？
They're supposed to come back for us, right?

1227
01:28:13,960 --> 01:28:15,985
我不知道 霍吉，你以前来过这里
I don't know. Well, Hodge, you been here before.

1228
01:28:16,062 --> 01:28:17,222
他们会回来的，对吗？
They're gonna come back for us, right?

1229
01:28:17,297 --> 01:28:19,561
是的，但是从来没有那么远
Yeah, but I never made it this far.

1230
01:28:19,632 --> 01:28:22,226
- 你一定在开玩笑  - 最后一周前没这样练过
- You're kidding.  - Not to the final week.

1231
01:28:23,102 --> 01:28:25,070
他们不会回来了
They're not coming back.

1232
01:28:25,672 --> 01:28:28,937
- 我们该怎么办？  - 好了，听着
- What do we do?  - All right, listen up.

1233
01:28:29,609 --> 01:28:31,543
我们待在一起
We stay together as a group.

1234
01:28:31,611 --> 01:28:34,102
没有人会落下，我们是一个团队
Nobody falls behind. We all stay together.

1235
01:28:34,180 --> 01:28:37,047
有人落后了，我们就跟在他的后面，好吗？
One guy goes back, we get him back up to the front, okay?

1236
01:28:37,116 --> 01:28:38,879
我们是个团队 乌拉
We're a team. Oorah.

1237
01:28:38,952 --> 01:28:40,647
- 乌拉  - 乌拉
- Oorah.  - Oorah!

1238
01:28:40,720 --> 01:28:42,483
我们走，5506
Let's do it, 5506.

1239
01:29:19,225 --> 01:29:21,853
先生，你没事，我是海岸警卫队救生员
Sir, it's okay, I'm with the US Coast Guard.

1240
01:29:48,588 --> 01:29:49,816
再来一次
Again.

1241
01:29:57,530 --> 01:30:00,863
我是海岸警卫队救生员 我是来救援你的
I'm a Coast Guard rescue swimmer. I'm here to help you.

1242
01:30:02,168 --> 01:30:03,465
暂停
Time-out.

1243
01:30:03,536 --> 01:30:04,867
全体起立
Class, pop tall.

1244
01:30:04,937 --> 01:30:07,872
霍吉,出来吧
Hodge, get yourself to the side of the pool.

1245
01:30:07,940 --> 01:30:09,339
是，二级军士长
Aye, aye, Senior Chief.

1246

1249

Class 5506, "Oorah, Hodge," on three!

01:33:41,721 --> 01:33:43,916
我们都知道会是怎么样的，对吗？
We both knew where this was going, right?

1290
01:33:44,557 --> 01:33:45,854
只是临时的
Just casual.

1291
01:33:47,693 --> 01:33:48,853
没错
Right.

1292

We need three crews in Sitka for the weekend.

1310
01:36:38,264 --> 01:36:39,629
你做好准备
You make sure that happens.

1311
01:36:39,699 --> 01:36:41,963
下周二团队会集结
And the stand team arrives here next Tuesday.

1312
01:36:42,635 --> 01:36:45,229
和妻子重归于好了吗？
Patch things up with the wife?

1313
01:36:47,139 --> 01:36:49,835
搞定那个女孩了吗？
You fix things up with that young lady?

1314
01:36:51,077 --> 01:36:53,841
你知道，你还是有机会的
Well, you still have a choice, you know.

1315
01:36:56,215 --> 01:37:00,379
嘿，有个问题我在学校的时候想问
Hey, there's a question I wanted to ask you back in school

1316
01:37:01,153 --> 01:37:02,245
却没有问
and I didn't.

1317
01:37:03,255 --> 01:37:06,383
当你不能拯救所有人的时候
But when you can't save them all,

1318
01:37:08,394 --> 01:37:10,521
你选择哪些人活下来呢？
how do you choose who lives?

1319
01:37:11,997 --> 01:37:14,932
这对每个人都不一样，杰克
It's probably different for everybody, Jake.

1320
01:37:16,035 --> 01:37:18,799
对我来说挺简单的，我只是
Kind of simple for me, though. I just...

1321
01:37:19,138 --> 01:37:23,234
我会带走我第一个遇到的 或是他们之中最虚弱的
I take the first one I come to or the weakest one in the group,

1322
01:37:23,309 --> 01:37:26,972
我尽可能游的更快
and then I swim as fast and as hard as I can

1323
01:37:28,013 --> 01:37:29,571
更持久
for as long as I can.

1324
01:37:31,717 --> 01:37:33,844
大海带走其余的人
And the sea takes the rest.

1325
01:37:38,924 --> 01:37:40,516
觉得我准备好了吗？
Think I'm ready?

1326
01:37:42,361 --> 01:37:46,627
我不再是你的老师了，杰克 我只是你的救生员同事
I'm not your teacher anymore, Jake. I'm just your fellow swimmer.

1327
01:37:46,699 --> 01:37:49,759
这不是我想得到的答案
That's not exactly the answer I'm looking for there.

1328
01:37:49,835 --> 01:37:53,794
如果我觉得你没准备好 我不会把你丢到白令海峡去
If I did not think you were ready, I would not put you in the Bering Sea.

1329
01:37:59,678 --> 01:38:01,942
6030，这是科迪亚克调度中心
6030, this is Kodiak Ops Cent.

1330
01:38:02,014 --> 01:38:04,141
我们要中指你们的训练任务
We are diverting your training mission at this time.

1331
01:38:04,216 --> 01:38:06,184
有两个年轻的船员困在洞里了
We have two young kayakers swept into the cave

1332
01:38:06,252 --> 01:38:07,685
斯特里洞南面1英里处
one mile south of Saltery Cove.

1333
01:38:07,753 --> 01:38:09,880
- 报告  - 6030收到
How copy?  - PILO T 1: 6030 copies.

1334
01:38:09,955 --> 01:38:12,321
- 终止训练  - 我们得到新任务
- We're diverting at this time.  - We've got a real case now.

1335
01:38:12,391 --> 01:38:14,120
好了，伙计们，看到海浪了吗
Okay, guys, that tide's coming in,

1336
01:38:14,193 --> 01:38:16,753
有6到8英尺的浪头从北面过来
and we've got six- to eight-foot rollers coming from the north.

1337
01:38:16,829 --> 01:38:19,457
军士长，费舍尔跟你去执行任务吗？
Senior, what do you think about taking Fischer with you on this?

1338
01:38:19,532 --> 01:38:22,262
我要他跟着我 他已经准备好了
I want him with me. All right? He's good to go.

1339
01:38:22,802 --> 01:38:25,327
我觉得进去不是很困难
I don't think it's gonna be a problem sliding in there.

1340
01:38:25,404 --> 01:38:28,168
出来的时候会遇上麻烦
I think the problem's gonna be coming back out.

1341
01:38:28,240 --> 01:38:31,266
所以我要杰克和我一起去 他可是人力皮划艇
That's why I got Jake with me. Got my human speedboat.

1342
01:38:33,813 --> 01:38:38,250
科迪亚克调度中心，我是6030 我们已经到达目的地
Kodiak Ops, this is 6030. We're on-scene at this time.

1343
01:38:40,119 --> 01:38:43,145
没有发现幸存者，我们准备入水
No sign of kayakers. I'm taking her down.

1344
01:38:48,060 --> 01:38:49,960
舱门打开
Cabin door is open and locked.

1345
01:38:50,329 --> 01:38:51,990
有10英尺高的浪头
Those are definitely ten-foot waves.

1346
01:38:53,766 --> 01:38:55,961
救生员准备
Swimmer's coming to the door.

1347
01:38:58,270 --> 01:38:59,794
记住，好吗？
Remember, all right?

1348
01:38:59,872 --> 01:39:04,241
海浪会把你冲到洞口
You got the whole weight of the ocean punching through that opening.

1349
01:39:04,310 --> 01:39:07,711
你得计算浪头
You gotta read the hydraulics, gotta count the waves,

1350
01:39:08,113 --> 01:39:10,081
然后等着回流
then wait for the flush.

1351
01:39:11,517 --> 01:39:13,144
检查救生员
Checking swimmer.

1352
01:39:13,886 --> 01:39:17,378
但愿你上课的时候仔细听了
Sure as hell hope you paid attention in class, Speedboat.

1353
01:39:39,445 --> 01:39:41,310
救生员入水
Swimmers in the water.

1354
01:39:41,547 --> 01:39:43,071
救生员良好
Swimmers okay.

1355
01:39:47,786 --> 01:39:50,880
救生员1号和2号进行交流
Swimmer Two is making contact with Swimmer One.

1356
01:40:26,825 --> 01:40:27,849
嘿
Hey!

1357
01:40:28,160 --> 01:40:29,184
这里!
Over here!

1358
01:40:29,261 --> 01:40:31,058
- 这里  - 这里!
- Here.  - Over here!

1359
01:40:31,130 --> 01:40:32,654
找到了，3点钟方向
Got them. Three o'clock.

1360
01:40:33,165 --> 01:40:34,530
这边
Right here.

1361
01:40:38,437 --> 01:40:40,769
我们是海岸警卫队救生员 我们来救援你们
We're rescue swimmers. We're gonna get you out of here.

1362
01:40:40,839 --> 01:40:42,864
真不敢相信你们真的来了
Can't believe you guys actually got here.

1363
01:40:42,942 --> 01:40:44,500
把手给我
Give me your hand.

1364
01:40:46,512 --> 01:40:47,706
只有你们两个？
Just the two of you?

1365
01:40:47,780 --> 01:40:49,372
是的 他的手伤的很重
Yeah, yeah. His arm's hurt real bad.

1366
01:40:49,448 --> 01:40:50,779
好的
All right.

1367
01:40:51,517 --> 01:40:56,580
1号救生员，有两个幸存者 准备放下救生篮
Swimmer One. I got two survivors. It's gonna be a basket pickup here.

1368
01:40:56,655 --> 01:40:57,674
明白
Roger.

1369
01:40:57,756 --> 01:40:58,848
这儿受伤了？
Broken here?

1370
01:40:58,924 --> 01:41:01,722
你带他先走，把他放到救生篮里
You take him first. Get him in the basket.

1371
01:41:02,594 --> 01:41:04,721
我和还有一个人跟在你后面
I'll follow with the other one right behind you.

1372
01:41:04,099 --> 01:41:06,005
- 明白吗？  - 好的
- You got that?  - Yeah.

1373
01:41:05,931 --> 01:41:06,920
- 明白了吗？  - 是的，明白
- You got it?  - Yeah, yeah.

1374
01:41:06,999 --> 01:41:09,024
我这样慢慢带着你，好吗？
All right. I'm gonna lower you down in here, all right?

1375
01:41:09,101 --> 01:41:11,296
- 好的  - 放松，伙计，我抓着你
- Okay.  - Relax, buddy. I got you.

1376
01:41:12,838 --> 01:41:14,169
好的
All right.

1377
01:41:14,606 --> 01:41:16,437
- 你跟着我  - 好的
- You're with me.  - Okay.

1378
01:41:25,317 --> 01:41:27,114
我不太会游泳
I don't swim so good.

1379
01:41:27,252 --> 01:41:30,050
- 你不太会游泳？  - 是的
- You don't swim so good?  - No, sir.

1380
01:41:30,122 --> 01:41:34,081
没关系，我游的很好，我跟着你
It's okay. I swim pretty good. All right, on your back.

1381
01:41:49,875 --> 01:41:53,709
- 等等，我们有小船坐吗？  - 我就是小船
- Wait. Are we gonna take the boat?  - I'm the boat.

1382
01:41:53,779 --> 01:41:55,246
等等，等等
Wait. Wait, wait, wait.

1383
01:41:55,314 --> 01:41:57,874
- 我还没准备好，我不能…  - 嘿
- I'm not ready! I can't...  - Hey!

1384
01:41:57,950 --> 01:42:00,680
- 等等，等等  - 冷静
- Wait, wait, wait...  - Settle down!

1385
01:42:20,072 --> 01:42:21,369
有些不对头
Something's not right.

1386
01:42:21,440 --> 01:42:23,533
1号救生员回到洞里了
Swimmer One's going back to the cave.

1387
01:42:54,673 --> 01:42:56,163
怎么了？
What happened?

1388
01:42:56,942 --> 01:42:58,409
他撞到了木头
He hit a log.

1389
01:42:59,411 --> 01:43:01,208
什么？你在…
What? What are you...

1390
01:43:02,347 --> 01:43:04,178
什么…
What...

1391
01:43:16,128 --> 01:43:18,221
- 他死了，杰克  - 他没有
He's gone, Jake.  - JAKE: He's not.

1392
01:43:20,666 --> 01:43:22,998
他只是撞到了头
He's just got a head laceration.

1393
01:43:27,773 --> 01:43:30,298
我们走，快走
Here we go. Come on.

1394
01:43:32,544 --> 01:43:33,772
我们走
Let's go.

1395
01:43:35,881 --> 01:43:37,143
我们走!
Let's go!

1396
01:43:40,686 --> 01:43:44,747
二级军士长朗道!注意力集中
Senior Chief Randall! Lock it in.

1397
01:43:47,960 --> 01:43:49,018
这只是简单的物理学
It's simple physics.

1398
01:43:49,094 --> 01:43:51,927
只要等着回流就行了，对吗？
We're just gonna time the flush, all right?

1399
01:43:55,667 --> 01:43:56,964
好的
All right.

1400
01:43:57,636 --> 01:43:59,433
你下令吧，救生员
You call it, Swimmer.

1401
01:44:06,745 --> 01:44:07,734
现在!
Now!

1402
01:44:18,290 --> 01:44:22,226
嘿，我知道你很疲倦，好吗 我知道你很累
Hey, I know you're tired, okay? I know you feel tired right now.

1403
01:44:22,294 --> 01:44:24,819
但你得把眼睛睁开，好吗
But you need to keep your eyes open, okay?

1404
01:44:24,930 --> 01:44:28,229
好吗？嘿，你来和他谈谈
All right? All right? Hey, I need you to keep talking to him.

1405
01:44:28,300 --> 01:44:29,995
- 你继续和他说  - 好的
- You keep talking to him.  - Okay.

1406
01:44:30,068 --> 01:44:31,865
军事长 军事长!
Senior. Senior!

1407
01:44:32,938 --> 01:44:35,202
你能帮我把这个打开吗？
Can you open these up for me?

1408
01:44:35,607 --> 01:44:38,337
我要你一个一个给我
One by one, I want you to hand them to me.

1409
01:44:38,577 --> 01:44:39,703
往上看
Reyes!

1410
01:44:39,778 --> 01:44:41,109
他没事
He's fine.

1411
01:44:42,981 --> 01:44:44,710
这里，伙计 这里
Right here, buddy. Right here. Okay?

1412
01:44:44,783 --> 01:44:45,807
- 好的  - 这里
- Okay.  - Right here.

1413
01:44:52,624 --> 01:44:54,353
- 罗伯特  - 我没事
Robert!  - I'm okay.

1414
01:44:54,426 --> 01:44:56,519
他的右臂有骨裂
He's got a compound fracture in his right radius.

1415
01:44:56,595 --> 01:44:58,688
我们试着固定住
We tried to stabilize that a little bit.

1416
01:44:58,764 --> 01:44:59,924
用的这个
We put a collar on this one,

1417
01:44:59,998 --> 01:45:01,625
但只是临时性的
but it's more precautionary than anything.

1418
01:45:01,700 --> 01:45:02,758
谢谢
Thank you.

1419
01:45:02,834 --> 01:45:04,859
他可能有些轻微脑震荡
This one's possibly a little bit concussive.

1420
01:45:04,937 --> 01:45:06,871
我们一路上都在帮他们检查
We checked their vitals the whole way back.

1421
01:45:06,939 --> 01:45:10,102
他们都有些体温过低 但会好起来的
They're both mildly hypothermic, but I think they'll come around.

1422
01:45:12,311 --> 01:45:13,938
非常感谢
Thank you so much.

1423
01:45:17,115 --> 01:45:18,707
不客气
You're welcome.

1424
01:45:22,621 --> 01:45:24,248
这是可能会发生的，本
It happens, Ben.

1425
01:45:25,557 --> 01:45:28,390
不该是我，不该是这样的
Not to me. Not like that.

1426
01:45:30,796 --> 01:45:34,698
我要你在我面前把这个签了
I want you to sign them in front of me.

1427
01:45:35,400 --> 01:45:37,300
你为什么不再考虑考虑呢？
Why don't you take some time and think about it?

1428
01:45:37,369 --> 01:45:38,734
不 这…
No. It's...

1429
01:45:40,038 --> 01:45:43,872
结束了 签了它吧
It's over. Just sign them.

1430
01:45:49,881 --> 01:45:51,075
拜托了
Please.

1431
01:46:15,340 --> 01:46:17,467
每个人都可能出现这样的情况
Could've happened to anyone.

1432
01:46:18,110 --> 01:46:19,270
也许吧
Maybe.

1433
01:46:19,745 --> 01:46:22,908
但是如果再发生了怎么办？
But what if it happens again? What then?

1434
01:46:23,915 --> 01:46:26,577
他只用缝几针就行了，不会有事的
Kid got a couple stitches. He's gonna be fine.

1435
01:46:26,652 --> 01:46:28,483
我们把他救出来了
We got him out of there.

1436
01:46:28,920 --> 01:46:30,319
不，是你救的
No, you did.

1437
01:46:30,956 --> 01:46:33,254
你今天表现很好
You were strong out there today.

1438
01:46:34,660 --> 01:46:36,423
我为你感到骄傲
I was proud of you.

1439
01:46:39,498 --> 01:46:41,295
你准备接下来做什么呢？
What are you gonna do?

1440
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:44,628
有朋友曾经建议我去钓鱼
Friend of mine once suggested fishing.

1441
01:46:46,338 --> 01:46:48,568
我想我会接受他的提议
Think I might take his advice.

1442
01:46:49,107 --> 01:46:50,335
钓鱼？
Fishing?

1443
01:46:50,742 --> 01:46:51,834
是的
Yeah.

1444
01:46:52,177 --> 01:46:54,645
我们这样的人不钓鱼的
Guys like us don't go fishing.

1445
01:46:55,881 --> 01:46:58,179
我以前好像听说过
Where have I heard that before?

1446
01:47:05,657 --> 01:47:08,922
军士长，你走之前
Senior, before you go,

1447
01:47:10,028 --> 01:47:11,928
我想知道一件事
I gotta know one thing.

1448
01:47:12,564 --> 01:47:14,532
正确的数字是多少？
What's your real number?

1449
01:47:19,250 --> 01:47:21,030
２２
Twenty-two.

1450
01:47:24,009 --> 01:47:25,340
２２？
Twenty-two?

1451
01:47:27,512 --> 01:47:31,608
还不坏 不是200，不是…
That's not bad. It's not 200. It's not...

1452
01:47:31,683 --> 01:47:34,743
22是我没救到的数字，杰克
Twenty-two's the number of people I lost, Jake.

1453
01:47:35,921 --> 01:47:38,048
我只记这个数字
Only number I kept track of.

1454
01:47:56,375 --> 01:47:58,673
把嘴里的海腥味去去
Keeps the sea out of your mouth.

1455
01:48:37,716 --> 01:48:38,740
嘿
Hey.

1456
01:48:39,551 --> 01:48:40,540
嗨
Hi.

1457
01:48:43,155 --> 01:48:45,248
你重新开始画画了？
You started painting again?

1458
01:48:46,224 --> 01:48:48,317
是的，可以有点事做
Yeah. Great light up there.

1459
01:48:56,568 --> 01:48:57,830
你知道
You know,

1460
01:48:59,504 --> 01:49:02,530
那个电话的事我得向你道歉，海伦
I wanna apologize for the phone calls, Helen.

1461
01:49:04,075 --> 01:49:06,475
我该给你空间的
I should've given you your space.

1462
01:49:07,846 --> 01:49:09,677
你觉得忽然出现在这里
And you felt showing up here unannounced

1463
01:49:09,748 --> 01:49:12,342
是最好的办法来沟通那件事吗？
was the best way to communicate that?

1464
01:49:18,523 --> 01:49:19,547
嘿
Hey.

1465
01:49:44,749 --> 01:49:46,148
- 请你…  - 本
- Please just...  - Ben.

1466
01:49:46,218 --> 01:49:50,279
我要你保存它，连同这个
I want you to have it, along with these.

1467
01:49:52,691 --> 01:49:54,181
我签了名
I signed them.

1468
01:50:00,298 --> 01:50:01,526
为什么是现在？
Why now?

1469
01:50:09,508 --> 01:50:12,409
我有…我以前有一次任务
I had a... I had a case a while back.

1470
01:50:12,477 --> 01:50:14,843
你知道的，有一对夫妻溺水了
You know, a couple was drowning.

1471
01:50:17,516 --> 01:50:18,744
但当我赶到那儿的时候
By the time I got there,

1472
01:50:18,817 --> 01:50:22,082
他丈夫正把他的妻子往下拽
the husband was dragging his wife under,

1473
01:50:22,988 --> 01:50:25,218
只是想让自己浮起来
just trying to stay afloat.

1474
01:50:26,725 --> 01:50:29,023
纯粹的生存本能
Pure survival instinct.

1475
01:50:31,897 --> 01:50:33,364
这让我…
It took me...

1476
01:50:35,233 --> 01:50:40,637
让我用了很长时间才意识到 其实那个人就是我
Took me a long time to understand that that man was me.

1477
01:50:45,210 --> 01:50:48,145
哦，可恶的，又来了
Oh, man. Oh, doggone it.

1478
01:50:53,251 --> 01:50:54,411
对不起
Sorry.

1479
01:50:56,454 --> 01:50:58,615
你要接听吗？
Aren't you gonna answer that?

1480
01:51:02,160 --> 01:51:04,856
我不再是个救生员了，海伦
I'm not a rescue swimmer anymore, Helen.

1481
01:51:31,690 --> 01:51:32,987
再见，亲爱的
Bye, baby.

1482
01:52:00,452 --> 01:52:01,476
注意
Lock it up.

1483
01:52:01,553 --> 01:52:04,420
一艘75英尺长的渔船求救
We have a 75-foot fishing vessel in distress,

1484
01:52:04,489 --> 01:52:06,457
在深海区域船进水
taking on water in high seas.

1485
01:52:07,559 --> 01:52:10,722
船失控了有4人在船上
She's dead in the water with four souls onboard.

1486
01:52:11,129 --> 01:52:14,030
抽水泵无法持续工作
With its dewatering pumps unable to keep up,

1487
01:52:14,332 --> 01:52:17,961
现在的问题不是船会不会沉 而是何时沉没
it's not a matter of if this thing is going down, but when.

1488
01:52:40,525 --> 01:52:43,756
绑紧一点 加把劲
Tighten her down! We gotta secure her.

1489
01:52:56,641 --> 01:53:00,771
遇到这样的情况你必须说不
There will come a time when you're going to have to say no.

1490
01:53:02,347 --> 01:53:08,547
当你面对5到20个船员对你说“救我救我”
You'll be facing crews from five to 20, all saying, "Save me, save me."

1491
01:53:09,120 --> 01:53:11,315
他们在等待奇迹
They're looking for a miracle.

1492
01:53:12,557 --> 01:53:14,047
在24岁的年纪
At 24 years old,

1493
01:53:14,125 --> 01:53:17,253
你得想办法成为那个奇迹
you have to find a way to be that miracle.

1494
01:53:17,462 --> 01:53:19,896
一切正常 我们要开始实施救援了
Sounds good. We'll plan our free-fall deployment to the water.

1495
01:53:19,964 --> 01:53:21,693
- 准备好了吗，杰克？  - 是的
- Are you good with that, Jake?  - Yeah, copy that.

1496
01:53:21,766 --> 01:53:24,997
如果我们要把你放下去 只能放在峰头上
Okay, if we have to put you in, we're gonna get you in upswell

1497
01:53:25,070 --> 01:53:27,038
让海浪把你带到船那边去
and let the waves take you down to the boat.

1498
01:53:27,105 --> 01:53:28,970
- 准备好了吗  - 是的
- Are you good with that?  - Roger.

1499
01:53:29,040 --> 01:53:31,406
我们只有20分钟
We're only gonna have about 20 minutes on-scene,

1500
01:53:31,476 --> 01:53:33,808
- 动作快一点  - 明白
- so we gotta be quick.  - Copy that.

1501
01:53:33,912 --> 01:53:37,609
我看到渔船了 2点钟方向，50米左右
All right, I got the vessel in sight. Two o'clock, about 50 meters.

1502
01:53:44,856 --> 01:53:46,824
舱门开启
Cabin door open and locked.

1503
01:53:46,891 --> 01:53:49,359
救生员准备
Pre-rescue checklist for free-fall deployment.

1504
01:53:50,862 --> 01:53:52,261
哇！船刚才吃了个大浪
Whoa, whoa! Boat just took a wave, sir.

1505
01:53:52,330 --> 01:53:53,729
一个人被冲到船边上了
One appears to have gone on the edge.

1506
01:53:53,798 --> 01:53:54,992
他挂在货网上了
He's hanging from the cargo net.

1507
01:53:56,267 --> 01:53:57,791
我们得把救生员放下去
We need to get our swimmer down there.

1508
01:53:57,869 --> 01:53:59,393
电脑显示风速60节
Computer's showing 60 knots...

1509
01:53:59,471 --> 01:54:00,961
别管电脑怎么说了
Going off com.

1510
01:54:01,306 --> 01:54:04,173
救生员准备
Prepare for a free-fall deployment of the rescue swimmer.

1511
01:54:07,645 --> 01:54:09,306
救生员再次检查
Rescue checklist, part two.

1512
01:54:09,380 --> 01:54:10,847
救生员准备完毕
Swimmer's getting ready.

1513
01:54:10,915 --> 01:54:12,974
检查完毕 救生员准备入水
Rescue checklist complete. Swimmer's coming out.

1514
01:54:13,051 --> 01:54:15,042
明白，检查救生员
Roger that. Check swimmer.

1515
01:54:15,286 --> 01:54:18,187
救生员准备完毕，检查
Swimmer's at the door, sir. Checking swimmer.

1516
01:54:18,256 --> 01:54:19,746
准备好了？
Swimmer ready?

1517
01:54:20,425 --> 01:54:22,620
上帝会保佑你的
God help you if you ain't, boy.

1518
01:54:26,498 --> 01:54:28,022
救生员下水了
Swimmer's away.

1519
01:54:36,941 --> 01:54:40,035
救生员情况良好 他朝渔船游过去了
Swimmer's okay. He's heading towards the vessel.

1520
01:54:46,584 --> 01:54:50,076
他切浪切的真不错
All right, he's cutting through those waves pretty good.

1521
01:55:09,908 --> 01:55:12,342
他接近船支了
That's it. He's approaching the vessel.

1522
01:55:12,911 --> 01:55:14,811
已经上船了，长官
He's at the boat, sir.

1523
01:55:20,618 --> 01:55:23,348
伙计，见到你太好了
Man, are we glad to see you!

1524
01:55:35,266 --> 01:55:37,632
科迪亚克调度中心，6034号呼叫
Kodiak Ops, rescue 6034.

1525
01:55:37,702 --> 01:55:39,932

Fischer's onboard, but vessel is compromised.

1526
01:55:40,004 --> 01:55:42,268
进了很多水，恐怕支持不了多久了
Taking on lots of water. May not hold much longer.

1527
01:55:42,340 --> 01:55:43,398
随时报告最新进展

1528

他的腿断了
This guy's got a broken leg.

1531
01:55:49,714 --> 01:55:52,444
船长在里面，他在试着发动抽水泵
The skipper's down below. He's trying to start the pumps.

1532
01:55:52,517 --> 01:55:55,350

- All right, he's gonna go up first.  - All right.

There's three onboard with injuries, one more down below.

1535
01:56:02,660 --> 01:56:04,719
你想让我怎么做？

1536
01:56:14,372 --> 01:56:16,567
你们帮忙把他放进来

系好安全带

The captain's down below, and there's one other man on deck.

1541
01:56:48,306 --> 01:56:50,740

Help him out. Strap yourself in. Get out of the way.

1542
01:56:50,808 --> 01:56:54,403
重复一遍，船就要沉了，给你8分钟
I repeat, the boat's going down fast. Eight minutes to bingo.

1543

01:57:54,872 --> 01:57:58,672
船长！我是救生员 我来帮你出去
Captain! I'm a rescue swimmer. I'm here to help you out.

1557
01:57:58,743 --> 01:58:02,270

Your leg is jammed in here? Or is it just closed...

1558
01:58:02,347 --> 01:58:04,076
我的整条腿

我们需要一点时间
We're gonna be a little bit.

1563
01:58:14,459 --> 01:58:15,892
1号救生员，我们没有时间了
Swimmer One, we're about out of time.

1564
01:58:15,960 --> 01:58:18,554

军士长 军士长，是你吗？

1635
02:04:10,414 --> 02:04:11,779
金鱼

军士长，马上就淹满了

1639
02:04:21,492 --> 02:04:24,256
二级军士长，把我弄出去!

军士长!船长在那边

1644
02:05:04,902 --> 02:05:06,392
杰克，他已经死了

1645
02:05:16,046 --> 02:05:17,138
杰克!
Jake!

1646
02:05:19,650 --> 02:05:21,015
救生员都出来了
I got both swimmers coming out.

1647
02:05:21,085 --> 02:05:23,679
- 两个救生员都能看见  - 好的，我看到他们了
- Both swimmers are in sight.  - All right, I got them.

1648
02:05:41,672 --> 02:05:42,832
钩子已放下
Hook is going down.

1649
02:05:42,907 --> 02:05:46,172
偏右40，钩子下落中
Let's go forward, right 40. Hook is halfway down.

1650
02:05:46,310 --> 02:05:48,073
我们要用钩子连在一起
I'm hooking into you.

1651
02:05:48,145 --> 02:05:50,443
我们只有一次机会
We're only gonna get one shot at this.

1652
02:05:53,350 --> 02:05:54,578
我钩好了
I'm in.

1653

1655
02:06:13,471 --> 02:06:15,371
那你说这是什么？

1656
02:06:20,878 --> 02:06:21,970

我们得解开它
I gotta jam this cable into the drum.

1660
02:06:43,801 --> 02:06:46,429
你在做什么？ 你在做什么？
What are you doing? What are you doing?

1661
02:06:48,806 --> 02:06:50,740
想都不要想
Don't even think about it.

1662
02:06:50,808 --> 02:06:52,935
这支撑不了我们两个
It's not gonna hold us both.

1663
02:06:53,143 --> 02:06:54,303
什么…
What...

1664
02:06:54,645 --> 02:06:57,705
会的，可以的 别干傻事
Yes, it will. Don't! Lt'll hold!

1665
02:07:01,352 --> 02:07:03,377
军士长落下去!
Senior fell. Senior fell!

1666
02:07:05,723 --> 02:07:07,156
杰克拉住他了 杰克拉住他了
Jake's got him. Jake's got him.

1667
02:07:07,224 --> 02:07:08,987
我得把他们拉上来
I gotta get them up.

1668
02:07:30,581 --> 02:07:32,105
我不会放弃的！
I won't let go!

1669
02:07:34,351 --> 02:07:35,511
我知道

1670
02:07:57,241 --> 02:07:58,731

1671
02:08:01,178 --> 02:08:02,577

1674
02:08:08,452 --> 02:08:11,046
他掉下去了，掉下去了 朗道要掉到水里去了!
He just fell! He just fell! Randall fell! Hit the water!

1675
02:08:11,121 --> 02:08:12,110
放开我
Lower me down!

1676
02:08:12,189 --> 02:08:14,157
他掉进水里了，被浪头打到了 只看到船的残片
He's in the water. Been hit by a wave, full debris.

1677
02:08:14,224 --> 02:08:15,691
- 放我下去!  - 不行!
- Put me down!  - I can't!

1678
02:08:15,759 --> 02:08:17,920
你得把我放下去!
You gotta lower me down now!

1679
02:08:20,164 --> 02:08:21,791
让我下去!

1680
02:08:21,899 --> 02:08:24,265
- 放我下去!  - 不行!
- You gotta lower me down!  - I can't!

1681
02:08:24,335 --> 02:08:25,324
让我跳下去
I'll free-fall!

1682
02:08:25,803 --> 02:08:29,933
你下去就上不来了 我不能损失两个人
If I do, you don't come back. I can't! I can't lose two!

1683
02:08:32,676 --> 02:08:34,473
损失救生员!损失救生员!
Lost swimmer. Lost swimmer.

1684
02:08:34,545 --> 02:08:37,446
他看到绳索快断了 他就放手了
He saw the cable coming apart. He just let go.

1685
02:08:38,148 --> 02:08:39,979
他从80或90的高度掉下去
He was about 80, 90 feet up, sir.

1686
02:08:40,050 --> 02:08:41,642
他没有上来，我没有看到他
He didn't come up. I don't see him.

1687
02:08:41,719 --> 02:08:43,744
打开远光灯
Flash landing hover lights.

1688
02:08:43,921 --> 02:08:45,218
注意无线电
Monitor the radio, sir.

1689
02:08:45,289 --> 02:08:48,656
寻找照明棒，闪光灯，一切东西 他掉在浪头里
Look for flares, strobes, anything. He fell right in the debris.

1690
02:08:49,593 --> 02:08:52,460
损失救生员，损失救生员
Lost swimmer. Lost swimmer.

1691
02:09:03,440 --> 02:09:04,771
海岸警卫队
The Coast Guard conducted

1692
02:09:04,842 --> 02:09:06,639
为一个人做了历史上
one of the largest search-and-rescue missions

1693
02:09:06,710 --> 02:09:08,507
最大规模的搜救行动
for a single man in its history,

1694
02:09:10,481 --> 02:09:14,042
但一直没有找到二级军士长 本・朗道的尸体
but the body of Senior Chief Ben Randall was never found.

1695
02:09:23,460 --> 02:09:25,087
我很抱歉，海伦
I'm sorry, Helen.

1696
02:09:26,397 --> 02:09:27,955
我们尽了最大努力了
There's nothing more we can do.

1697
02:09:29,099 --> 02:09:30,862
是什么造就了传奇？
What makes a legend?

1698
02:09:31,969 --> 02:09:34,164
是一个人在活着的时候做了什么？
Is it what someone did when they were alive...

1699
02:09:34,238 --> 02:09:36,206
朗道从来都不太在意这种事情
Randall never was much for this sort of thing.

1700
02:09:36,273 --> 02:09:39,242
或者在他死去还被别人惦记？
Or how they're remembered after they're gone?

1701
02:09:41,345 --> 02:09:43,279
有些人相信
Some people actually believe

1702
02:09:43,347 --> 02:09:46,646
二级军士长游到了阿留申群岛
Senior Chief made the swim to the Aleutian Islands.

1703
02:09:47,584 --> 02:09:50,417
他在某个海滩
He's standing on a distant beach somewhere

1704
02:09:50,521 --> 02:09:52,853
手上拿着钓竿
with a fishing pole in his hand.

1705
