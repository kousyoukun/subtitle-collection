00:00:42,509 --> 00:00:46,343
<i>There's a legend
of a man who lives beneath the sea.</i>

2
00:00:46,413 --> 00:00:48,313
<i>He is a fisher of men,</i>

3
00:00:48,615 --> 00:00:52,278
<i>the last hope of all those
who have been left behind.</i>

4
00:00:52,352 --> 00:00:55,879
<i>Many survivors claim to have felt
his gripping hands beneath them,</i>

5
00:00:55,955 --> 00:00:57,889
<i>pushing them up to the surface,</i>

6
00:00:57,957 --> 00:01:01,120
<i>whispering strength
until help could arrive.</i>

7
00:01:01,194 --> 00:01:04,527
<i>But this, of course, is only a legend.</i>

8
00:01:08,468 --> 00:01:09,867
Help!

9
00:01:10,637 --> 00:01:12,002
Over here!

10
00:01:16,209 --> 00:01:17,369
Sherilyn!

11
00:01:17,544 --> 00:01:18,568
Help!

12
00:01:18,645 --> 00:01:21,580
Ma'am, I'm a Coast Guard
rescue swimmer.

13
00:01:21,648 --> 00:01:23,172
I'm here to help you.

14
00:01:24,451 --> 00:01:28,854
Sir, stay with your flotation.
I'll be back for you.

15
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:30,981
- Don't leave me!
- Just stay there.

16
00:01:31,057 --> 00:01:33,116
Don't you leave me!

17
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:38,991
<i>Basket is outside
the cabin door and going down.</i>

18
00:01:39,065 --> 00:01:40,089
<i>Roger. Copy you.</i>

19
00:01:40,166 --> 00:01:43,101
<i>Forward and right 30.
Forward and right 15.</i>

20
00:01:43,169 --> 00:01:44,158
<i>Right 15.</i>

21
00:01:44,237 --> 00:01:45,226
<i>Ho, ho, ho!</i>

22
00:01:46,039 --> 00:01:48,200
<i>Basket is in the water.</i>

23
00:01:48,274 --> 00:01:50,242
<i>Swimmer and survivor
are at the basket.</i>

24
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:52,175
Put your head in first.

25
00:01:55,815 --> 00:01:57,214
I gotta get out!

26
00:01:57,283 --> 00:01:58,511
<i>Easy, forward.</i>

27
00:01:59,352 --> 00:02:02,048
Let go! Let go.

28
00:02:02,288 --> 00:02:04,722
Let go. You're drowning her!

29
00:02:09,429 --> 00:02:11,954
<i>Swimmer just popped him in the face.</i>

30
00:02:15,435 --> 00:02:17,995
<i>Okay, he's putting the man
in the basket.</i>

31
00:02:18,071 --> 00:02:19,868
<i>The man is in the basket.</i>

32
00:02:20,173 --> 00:02:22,073
<i>We're taking the load.</i>

33
00:02:26,846 --> 00:02:28,143
<i>Whoa, big wave.</i>

34
00:02:33,553 --> 00:02:35,680
Get out! Get out!
What's wrong with you?

35
00:02:35,755 --> 00:02:37,416
Sit there and shut up.

36
00:02:57,277 --> 00:02:58,437
<i>Swimmer in sight.</i>

37
00:03:02,782 --> 00:03:04,545
<i>Prepare to take the load.</i>

38
00:03:04,617 --> 00:03:06,608
<i>I have the ready-for-pickup signal.</i>

39
00:03:15,061 --> 00:03:17,655
<i>Swimmer is approaching cabin door.</i>

40
00:03:18,264 --> 00:03:20,232
<i>Survivor looks unconscious.</i>

41
00:03:21,901 --> 00:03:23,994
<i>Swimmer inside the cabin door.</i>

42
00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:28,334
<i>Cabin door closing.</i>

43
00:03:42,589 --> 00:03:44,284
I think you just broke my nose.

44
00:03:44,357 --> 00:03:47,019
And you may have killed your wife, sir.

45
00:03:48,928 --> 00:03:50,259
<i>Twenty minutes to Kodiak.</i>

46
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:53,094
<i>Roger.
He's giving her CPR.</i>

47
00:03:53,266 --> 00:03:55,962
<i>Comstate Kodiak,
this is Coast Guard 6096.</i>

48
00:03:56,035 --> 00:03:58,663
<i>We have
two hypothermic survivors onboard.</i>

49
00:03:58,738 --> 00:03:59,762
<i>We'll be there in 20 minutes.</i>

50
00:03:59,839 --> 00:04:02,865
<i>Requesting to have an ambulance
on-scene when we land.</i>

51
00:04:22,829 --> 00:04:24,126
Whoa, there we go.

52
00:04:25,331 --> 00:04:26,958
<i>- Got her?
- Got her!</i>

53
00:04:43,716 --> 00:04:45,274
Attaway, baby.

54
00:04:46,552 --> 00:04:47,951
There's dead,

55
00:04:51,224 --> 00:04:52,885
then there's dead.

56
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:56,421
I swear,
you get better with age.

57
00:05:23,556 --> 00:05:25,854
- Had to hit him, huh?
- Yeah.

58
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:29,223
You are not. You stay over there!
You stay over there!

59
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:34,290
Seems like it's always the big ones
that crack.

60
00:05:36,369 --> 00:05:37,461
Lieutenant.

61
00:05:37,537 --> 00:05:41,200
Crew said that she went under.
They thought you'd lost her.

62
00:05:41,607 --> 00:05:43,666
Lucky guess.

63
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:46,709
Luck, my ass.

64
00:06:08,267 --> 00:06:11,100
- I didn't think you were serious.
- Of course you didn't, Ben.

65
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:12,831
How could you possibly think
I was serious?

66
00:06:12,905 --> 00:06:15,100
I'm not some nameless
drowning victim.

67
00:06:15,174 --> 00:06:19,110
Oh, gee, I'm sorry saving lives
doesn't jive with our social...

68
00:06:20,613 --> 00:06:21,602
That's...

69
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:24,876
That's my chair.

70
00:06:24,951 --> 00:06:27,010
Oh, he's right. Not that chair.

71
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:32,753
I'm sorry. I was just pointing things out
in the living room. He didn't know.

72
00:06:33,359 --> 00:06:35,623
I would never take your chair.

73
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:44,665
Pick it up, would...

74
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:49,269
Doesn't have to be messy, Ben.

75
00:06:49,342 --> 00:06:52,778
It's clean, simple for both of us.
We don't have kids.

76
00:06:55,982 --> 00:06:57,950
Well, what about Friday?

77
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:01,717
What about Friday?

78
00:07:01,788 --> 00:07:04,222
We were gonna go
with Carl and Bridget, you know,

79
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:07,657
to that dinner-dance thing at the base.

80
00:07:09,228 --> 00:07:11,788
The base? All-you-can-eat wings?

81
00:07:11,864 --> 00:07:15,459
A dart game to settle the tab?
That's the date that we can't break?

82
00:07:15,535 --> 00:07:17,628
- You're right. You're right.
- Wow.

83
00:07:17,703 --> 00:07:21,935
Look, we'll... We'll go away, all right?
Just us.

84
00:07:22,575 --> 00:07:23,735
It's too late, Ben.

85
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:26,608
I don't know what I can say to you
that I haven't said already.

86
00:07:26,679 --> 00:07:29,113
It's time for me to rescue myself.

87
00:07:36,489 --> 00:07:39,253
Maybe... Maybe I should be the one
to move out.

88
00:07:39,325 --> 00:07:40,417
<i>Hi, you've reached Helen.</i>

89
00:07:40,493 --> 00:07:41,619
<i>And Ben.</i>

90
00:07:41,694 --> 00:07:42,718
<i>Leave a message.</i>

91
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:44,922
You don't even know where anything is
in this house.

92
00:07:44,997 --> 00:07:46,157
It's much easier this way.

93
00:07:46,232 --> 00:07:48,700
<i>Senior Chief, please report to base.</i>

94
00:07:49,735 --> 00:07:52,829
I can... I can fix this, all right? I...

95
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,573
I can...

96
00:07:57,276 --> 00:07:58,834
I can fix this.

97
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:02,548
Just tell me what to do.

98
00:08:03,249 --> 00:08:04,978
Tell me what to do.

99
00:08:11,424 --> 00:08:13,085
- Just let me go.
- No.

100
00:08:13,893 --> 00:08:16,225
- Just let me go.
- No.

101
00:08:24,437 --> 00:08:26,371
You should answer that.

102
00:08:28,674 --> 00:08:32,610
<i>Ready rescue helo 6096.
Swimmer One, return to base.</i>

103
00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:36,577
- I don't wanna lose her.
- Then change.

104
00:08:36,649 --> 00:08:39,311
Ben, how many times
have we had this conversation?

105
00:08:39,385 --> 00:08:43,412
The only way for you to save it
is to give this up and fly a desk.

106
00:08:44,323 --> 00:08:47,121
Exactly. She just wants to live.

107
00:08:48,794 --> 00:08:51,627
Hey, maybe we can get a hobby.
Both of us.

108
00:08:52,265 --> 00:08:54,165
Something like fishing.

109
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,794
- Fishing?
- Yeah.

110
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:58,234
Guys like us don't fish, Carl.

111
00:08:58,304 --> 00:09:00,465
It'll work out. Always does.

112
00:09:01,974 --> 00:09:05,967
Let me ask you something, seriously.
Is it too soon for me to ask her out?

113
00:09:06,178 --> 00:09:07,475
I guess so.

114
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:12,450
<i>Mayday! Mayday!
Mayday!</i>

115
00:09:12,518 --> 00:09:14,509
<i>This is cargo vessel Seaqueen.</i>

116
00:09:15,121 --> 00:09:18,284
<i>We're at 55 degrees,
12 minutes north.</i>

<i>167 degrees, 10 minutes west.</i>

118
00:09:22,662 --> 00:09:23,788
<i>We're taking on water.</i>

119
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:27,662
We're abandoning ship.
I repeat, abandoning ship.

120
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:38,206
Son, look at me. Look at me.
You're gonna be okay. Got that?

121
00:09:38,277 --> 00:09:40,404
Got that? We're gonna be okay.

122
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,570
Okay.

123
00:09:57,563 --> 00:09:59,656
<i>We have

124
00:09:59,732 --> 00:10:00,858
<i>- Any secondaries?
- No.</i>

125
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:03,026
<i>Circuit breakers are in,
so it definitely has failed,</i>

126
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:04,535
<i>but we're not building up any ice.</i>

127
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:08,005
<i>- How's the fuel?
- Forty minutes to bingo.</i>

128
00:10:08,074 --> 00:10:10,372
<i>- All right, take the stick.
- Okay, I have the controls.</i>

129
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:11,842
<i>All right, huddle time, boys.</i>

130
00:10:11,911 --> 00:10:14,277
<i>We have a de-ice fail.
We're low on fuel.</i>

131
00:10:14,347 --> 00:10:18,113
<i>The rulebook says we cut our losses.
What do you think, Ben?</i>

132
00:10:18,584 --> 00:10:21,144
<i>Well, we go home, they die, Bill.</i>

<i>Lower! Lower!
Right side. Debris in water.</i>

<i>- Request to open cabin door.
- Roger. Open door.</i>

<i>Kodiak Ops,

00:11:33,626 --> 00:11:35,116
<i>I'm going in.</i>

00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:41,257
<i>They're dead, Ben. Ben, they're dead!</i>

149
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:43,062

<i>There's six PIWs all tied together.

Not our call. They're on-scene.
They'll make the assessment.

We got a live one!</i>

157
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:11,059
<i>You got five minutes,
then we're hauling your ass back up.</i>

158
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:13,257
<i>Kodiak Ops,
this is Coast Guard 6096.</i>

159
00:12:13,332 --> 00:12:15,766
<i>We have people in the water,
and we are deploying our swimmer.</i>

160
00:12:15,835 --> 00:12:17,996
6096, Kodiak Ops, copy.

161
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:20,504
<i>One's holding the flare.
I see no other movement.</i>

162
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:21,597
<i>Roger that.</i>

163
00:12:21,674 --> 00:12:22,971
<i>Swimmer's ready to deploy.</i>

164
00:12:23,042 --> 00:12:26,102
<i>- Check swimmer.
- Roger. Checking swimmer.</i>

165
00:12:29,715 --> 00:12:32,411
<i>Swimmer's dressed out.
Checklist is complete.</i>

166
00:12:32,485 --> 00:12:33,952
<i>Five minutes.</i>

167
00:12:37,723 --> 00:12:39,350
<i>Swimmer's away.</i>

168
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:48,157
<i>Swimmer's okay.</i>

169
00:12:48,234 --> 00:12:51,465
<i>- Clear to move back and left 30.
- Clear back and left.</i>

170
00:13:11,524 --> 00:13:12,923
<i>How we looking
on fuel there?</i>

171
00:13:12,992 --> 00:13:15,222
<i>Two minutes to bingo.</i>

172
00:13:22,001 --> 00:13:24,697
I'm a Coast Guard rescue swimmer
here to help you, son.

173
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:28,467
You're gonna be okay.
I'm gonna get you in that helicopter.

174
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:36,077
<i>- I have the ready-for-pickup signal.
- Roger.</i>

175
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:44,118
<i>Basket is going out the cabin door.</i>

176
00:13:45,191 --> 00:13:46,988
<i>Bingo. We're at bingo. Gotta go.</i>

177
00:13:47,059 --> 00:13:48,390
<i>Ease it back.</i>

178
00:13:49,261 --> 00:13:52,424
<i>- Basket is in the water!
- We're out of time. We gotta go, Carl.</i>

179
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:55,558
<i>Hold position. Steady. Hold.</i>

180
00:13:55,634 --> 00:13:57,499
<i>He's putting the survivor in the basket.</i>

181
00:13:57,570 --> 00:13:59,299
<i>Your rad alt's going crazy.</i>

182
00:13:59,371 --> 00:14:02,204
<i>Yeah, yeah, I know.
I'm all over the place.</i>

183
00:14:06,912 --> 00:14:08,743
<i>Come on, Carl, we gotta go now!</i>

184
00:14:08,814 --> 00:14:11,078
<i>I don't have
a ready-for-pickup signal yet.</i>

185
00:14:13,552 --> 00:14:16,020
Whoa! Carl! Behind you!

186
00:14:16,088 --> 00:14:17,419
<i>Holy shit!</i>

187
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:21,252
<i>We lost our tail rotor!</i>

188
00:14:24,597 --> 00:14:26,531
<i>Mayday! Mayday! Mayday!</i>

189
00:14:29,435 --> 00:14:31,665
<i>Coast Guard 6096 is going down!</i>

190
00:14:31,737 --> 00:14:33,967
<i>Mayday! Mayday! 6096 is going in.</i>

191
00:15:18,684 --> 00:15:20,879
Carl. I'm here.

192
00:15:20,953 --> 00:15:21,942
Carl.

193
00:15:24,123 --> 00:15:27,024
Hold on, Carl. Hold on.

194
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:30,451
They'll be coming for us.

195
00:15:33,198 --> 00:15:35,723
I got you. You're okay now.

196
00:15:36,568 --> 00:15:38,798
You're okay. I'm here, Carl.

197
00:15:40,372 --> 00:15:42,897
We're okay. Hang on. I got you.

198
00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:47,670
- You think they're coming?
- Oh, yeah, they're coming.

199
00:15:50,549 --> 00:15:52,813
I want a C-130
over that crash site now.

200
00:15:52,885 --> 00:15:54,819
Lieutenant Krauss,
start the mishap checklist.

201
00:15:54,887 --> 00:15:55,876
Aye, Captain.

202
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:57,786
Captain, I've got an EPIRB hit
on Randall's survivor suit.

203
00:15:57,856 --> 00:15:59,847
Launch ready helos. Swimmer provide.

204
00:15:59,925 --> 00:16:03,088
We have a C-130 coming off a case
off Attu. It's already low on fuel.

205
00:16:03,162 --> 00:16:04,595
I don't care. Have them cut an engine.

206
00:16:04,663 --> 00:16:06,255
I want him to know
he's not alone out there.

207
00:16:10,669 --> 00:16:12,796
Listen. Listen.

208
00:16:14,873 --> 00:16:16,431
You hear that?

209
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:35,883
Hold on, Carl.
Here we go, Carl. I got you.

210
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:39,395
What's the ETA on the backup helo?

211
00:16:39,465 --> 00:16:40,489
Helo's en route to Cold Bay.

212
00:16:40,566 --> 00:16:42,295
They should be on-scene,
three, maybe four hours.

213
00:16:42,368 --> 00:16:43,392
Make it three.

214
00:16:56,715 --> 00:17:00,446
Jesus. How much more of that stuff
do you think I got in me?

215
00:17:01,153 --> 00:17:02,745
Feel that?

216
00:17:03,956 --> 00:17:05,890
- You feel that?
- Yeah.

217
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:08,984
That means you're alive.
I'm not gonna let go.

218
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:14,731
- Don't you!
- I'm not gonna. I'm not gonna.

219
00:18:08,454 --> 00:18:10,012
serious fractures,
like in the C-spine,

220
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:11,488
which could cause paralysis.

221
00:18:11,557 --> 00:18:15,118
Mostly what we see is old fractures
in the arms, also in the leg,

222
00:18:15,194 --> 00:18:18,061
but nothing acute.
Nothing new with this injury, luckily.

223
00:18:18,897 --> 00:18:20,626
We just hope the kidneys kick in

224
00:18:20,699 --> 00:18:22,997
and start to help him
resolve a lot of that fluid.

225
00:18:23,068 --> 00:18:24,592
Thank you very much.

226
00:19:03,575 --> 00:19:06,305
We've been friends a long time,
haven't we?

227
00:19:06,378 --> 00:19:08,403
I've always been good to you,
haven't I?

228
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,711
Didn't promote you to a desk when
you turned 40 like everybody else.

229
00:19:11,783 --> 00:19:12,807
That's right.

230
00:19:12,885 --> 00:19:15,945
All right,
so now I need you to listen to me.

231
00:19:16,021 --> 00:19:17,147
Okay.

232
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:20,658
There's an instructor opening
at "A" School, that...

233
00:19:20,726 --> 00:19:22,921
No. The answer is no.

234
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:25,327
You just said you'd listen. Sit down.

235
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:27,765
I'm not interested, Captain.

236
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:31,291
Well, it's no longer a request,
Senior Chief. Sit down.

237
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:32,894
You're serious?

238
00:19:40,612 --> 00:19:42,546
You have two choices.

239
00:19:42,614 --> 00:19:45,879
Sign the papers today and you can
live life as a civilian here in Kodiak,

240
00:19:45,951 --> 00:19:47,680
if that's what you want.

241
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:51,914
Or you can take that "A" School
opening I'm offering you.

242
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:53,924
I've already spoken to command
down there.

243
00:19:53,992 --> 00:19:56,893
It will be your class.
You will be in charge.

244
00:19:56,962 --> 00:19:59,760
You can take the time
to work your way back into shape.

245
00:19:59,831 --> 00:20:01,059
I am in shape.

246
00:20:01,133 --> 00:20:04,125
God damn it,
that's not what I'm talking about.

247
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:09,206
Ben, all I'm asking is that
you go down there for a few months.

248
00:20:09,274 --> 00:20:11,834
You work with the kids, you recharge.

249
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:15,471
Download that epic résumé
where it's gonna do some good.

250
00:20:18,183 --> 00:20:21,243
You can't always be
the one in the water, Ben.

251
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:23,914
You'll know
when you're ready to come back.

252
00:21:11,003 --> 00:21:13,631
You people got 15 seconds
to get off this bus.

253
00:21:13,705 --> 00:21:16,572
Move! Move! Let's go! Get off the bus!

254
00:21:30,322 --> 00:21:32,381
Hurry up.
Let's go, let's go.

255
00:21:36,862 --> 00:21:38,489
Put your white books
in your red bags.

256
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:41,455
Let's get that squared away now.
Put those books away.

257
00:21:41,533 --> 00:21:43,933
Females,
grab your bags, fall out to the rear.

258
00:21:44,002 --> 00:21:45,993
Follow Chief Flight
and Petty Officer Hall.

259
00:21:46,071 --> 00:21:48,801
The rest of you, pick a bunk,
put on your ODUs.

260
00:21:48,874 --> 00:21:51,342
You started with 15 minutes,
you are now down to 12.

261
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:54,402
Move! Move, move, move!

262
00:21:55,814 --> 00:21:58,112
Move it out. Get changed
out of those working blues.

263
00:21:58,183 --> 00:21:59,912
Hurry up. Move it out.

264
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:02,112
Find your rack. Quit wasting my time.

265
00:22:02,187 --> 00:22:05,486
Hey. Hey! That's my stuff, man.

266
00:22:05,724 --> 00:22:07,885
Hey, that's his bunk.

267
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:10,255
You two a couple?

268
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:15,124
It's okay. I like the top better anyway.

269
00:22:17,569 --> 00:22:19,230
<i>Out of the 39,000
men and women</i>

270
00:22:19,304 --> 00:22:21,135
<i>who make up
the United States Coast Guard,</i>

271
00:22:21,206 --> 00:22:24,141
<i>there are only 280 rescue swimmers.</i>

272
00:22:24,209 --> 00:22:25,540
Let's go! Let's go, mermaids!

273
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:27,601
<i>This is because
we are the Coast Guard's elite.</i>

274
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:29,544
<i>We are the best of the best.</i>

275
00:22:29,614 --> 00:22:32,947
<i>When storms shut down entire ports,
we go out.</i>

276
00:22:33,418 --> 00:22:36,876
<i>When hurricanes ground
the United States Navy, we go out.</i>

277
00:22:36,955 --> 00:22:39,549
<i>And when the holy Lord himself
reaches down from heaven</i>

278
00:22:39,624 --> 00:22:43,560
and destroys his good work with winds
that rip houses off the ground,

279
00:22:43,862 --> 00:22:45,727
we go out.

280
00:22:46,698 --> 00:22:50,327
And the attrition rate at this school
is well over 50%.

281
00:22:50,402 --> 00:22:55,066
So if by some miracle you actually
have what it takes to become one of us,

282
00:22:55,741 --> 00:22:59,575
then you get to live a life of meager pay

283
00:22:59,644 --> 00:23:03,774
with the distinct possibility
of dying slow, cold and alone

284
00:23:04,149 --> 00:23:05,673
somewhere in the vast sea.

285
00:23:06,785 --> 00:23:10,152
However, you also get the chance
to save lives,

286
00:23:11,089 --> 00:23:14,490
and there is no greater calling
in the world than that.

287
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:18,962
So, ladies and gentlemen, welcome.
Welcome to "A" School.

288
00:23:19,564 --> 00:23:21,589
Are there any questions?

289
00:23:23,335 --> 00:23:26,736
Captain, Airman Fischer.
Just have one question.

290
00:23:27,572 --> 00:23:31,030
That guy who holds all them records,
is he still alive?

291
00:23:31,309 --> 00:23:32,537
Why do you ask?

292
00:23:32,611 --> 00:23:34,135
I just thought you ought to let him know

293
00:23:34,212 --> 00:23:35,975
I'm about to knock his name
off that board.

294
00:23:36,047 --> 00:23:38,447
Really?
Why don't you let him know yourself?

295
00:23:38,517 --> 00:23:41,975
He's standing right behind you
in the back of the room.

296
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:45,756
Class, turn around
and greet Senior Chief Ben Randall.

297
00:23:46,691 --> 00:23:51,287
Senior Chief Randall will be your
lead instructor for the next 18 weeks.

298
00:23:51,363 --> 00:23:54,992
Senior Chief Randall is one of
the most decorated rescue swimmers

299
00:23:55,066 --> 00:23:58,160
in the history
of the United States Coast Guard.

300
00:23:59,738 --> 00:24:02,366
Ben, would you care
to address the class?

301
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:05,376
No, I think there's been enough talk
for one day.

302
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:08,106
Chief Skinner, they're all yours.

303
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:10,080
Attention on deck.

304
00:24:10,148 --> 00:24:12,082
- Carry on.
- Aye, Captain.

305
00:24:13,385 --> 00:24:16,183
PT test begins at 0700 tomorrow.

306
00:24:16,254 --> 00:24:18,484
Class dismissed.
You will file through the front door.

307
00:24:18,557 --> 00:24:20,081
First row first, followed by the second.

308
00:24:20,158 --> 00:24:21,625
Frank.

309
00:24:23,028 --> 00:24:25,792
"When God rips houses
off the ground"?

310
00:24:26,932 --> 00:24:28,456
I was rolling.

311
00:24:28,967 --> 00:24:31,595
And I didn't mean
to put you on the spot up there.

312
00:24:32,404 --> 00:24:35,339
And I was real sorry
to hear about your crew.

313
00:24:35,874 --> 00:24:38,104
Come on. I'll show you around.

314
00:24:38,977 --> 00:24:42,071
- So I hear you're staying in a single?
- Yeah.

315
00:24:42,814 --> 00:24:46,181
Helen's got some family business
she's gotta take care of up there.

316
00:24:48,954 --> 00:24:50,854
<i>Mayday, mayday, mayday!</i>

317
00:24:51,289 --> 00:24:53,951
<i>This is Ballmariner! Ballmariner!</i>

318
00:24:54,426 --> 00:24:57,725
<i>We are on fire! We are on fire!</i>

319
00:25:20,452 --> 00:25:21,510
Go!

320
00:25:21,586 --> 00:25:24,555
- Let's go, let's go, let's go!
- Let's go, logs.

321
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:26,915
Let's move it out! Let's move it out!

322
00:25:26,992 --> 00:25:29,290
Work as a team! Work as a team!

323
00:25:31,129 --> 00:25:32,187
- Two lines.
- Two lines.

324
00:25:32,264 --> 00:25:33,561
- Two lines.
- Two lines.

325
00:25:55,053 --> 00:25:56,418
Do you understand me?

326
00:25:56,488 --> 00:25:57,853
Yes, Petty Officer Hall.

327
00:25:57,923 --> 00:26:00,551
Very well, let's try it. Lean and rest!

328
00:26:02,727 --> 00:26:04,319
Pop tall.

329
00:26:04,829 --> 00:26:05,921
Oorah!

330
00:26:05,997 --> 00:26:07,464
- What the hell was that?
- That was terrible.

331
00:26:07,532 --> 00:26:08,521
That was the worst
I've ever seen.

332
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:09,589
That was terrible.

333
00:26:09,668 --> 00:26:11,158
Let's try that again.

334
00:26:21,646 --> 00:26:23,273
Twenty-two.
Come on!

335
00:26:23,348 --> 00:26:24,610
- Up!
- Twenty-three.

336
00:26:24,683 --> 00:26:26,048
Down. Up.

337
00:26:26,117 --> 00:26:28,176
- Twenty-four.
- Get that ass down, Cable!

338
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:29,618
- Up!
- Twenty-five.

339
00:26:30,088 --> 00:26:32,215
That is absolutely horrible.

340
00:26:32,290 --> 00:26:35,191
Pop tall to the lone pine and back! Go!

341
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:38,627
Move your ass!
Let's move it! Get it going!

342
00:26:38,797 --> 00:26:39,821
Let's go.

343
00:26:42,067 --> 00:26:43,056
Let's go.

344
00:26:43,301 --> 00:26:44,598
Bring them back.

345
00:26:44,669 --> 00:26:47,638
- Circle back!
- Let's go! Get back here!

346
00:26:47,706 --> 00:26:49,037
- Get back in line!
- Let's move!

347
00:26:49,107 --> 00:26:50,870
- Back in formation.
- Let's move, move, move!

348
00:26:50,942 --> 00:26:52,842
Back in formation.

349
00:26:53,912 --> 00:26:56,437
Lean and rest. Senior Chief on deck.

350
00:27:30,782 --> 00:27:32,044
Pop tall.

351
00:27:33,318 --> 00:27:34,342
Oorah!

352
00:27:34,986 --> 00:27:36,817
I don't care who you are,

353
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:39,022
where you are from
or where you are going.

354
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:41,024
I care about one thing
and one thing only.

355
00:27:41,092 --> 00:27:44,084
That is the future victims
that you will be asked to save.

356
00:27:44,162 --> 00:27:47,928
If I feel that you will fail them,
I will fail you, understood?

357
00:27:47,999 --> 00:27:50,297
Yes, Senior Chief!

358
00:27:52,404 --> 00:27:55,100
Hodge. Where are you from, Hodge?

359
00:27:55,173 --> 00:27:57,368
I'm from Teaneck, New Jersey,
Senior Chief!

360
00:27:57,442 --> 00:27:59,535
Hodge is our triple repeat.

361
00:28:00,378 --> 00:28:02,846
Do you plan on making it this time,
threepeat?

362
00:28:02,914 --> 00:28:04,176
I really hope to, Senior Chief.

363
00:28:04,249 --> 00:28:06,080
Yeah, well, hope don't float, Hodge.

364
00:28:06,151 --> 00:28:09,177
You better start to learn to swim
against the current and not with it.

365
00:28:09,254 --> 00:28:11,154
Aye, aye, Senior Chief.

366
00:28:11,923 --> 00:28:13,185
Fisch.

367
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:16,891
Fisch. Why are you here, Fisch?

368
00:28:17,462 --> 00:28:20,363
I'm here to exceed your expectations,
Senior Chief.

369
00:28:20,432 --> 00:28:23,959
I'm a rescue swimmer at heart,
born, bred and water-fed. Oorah!

370
00:28:24,836 --> 00:28:27,498
Wow. I bet you practiced that
all morning.

371
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,733
Mr. Fischer is
our high school swim champ.

372
00:28:30,809 --> 00:28:33,607
He's had scholarships
to every lvy League.

373
00:28:34,045 --> 00:28:37,606
Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't realize that he was so qualified.

374
00:28:37,816 --> 00:28:40,284
I mean, you set records in a pool?

375
00:28:41,119 --> 00:28:42,177
That's amazing.

376
00:28:42,253 --> 00:28:45,984
I'll bet it was like, what,
eight feet deep in the deep end?

377
00:28:47,525 --> 00:28:49,720
What if your nose plug didn't work?

378
00:28:49,794 --> 00:28:52,888
What if another swimmer
had cut into your lane?

379
00:28:56,301 --> 00:28:59,429
For the love of God,
you could have been killed.

380
00:29:00,772 --> 00:29:03,707
Your schedule says that you will
perform a PT test this morning.

381
00:29:03,775 --> 00:29:05,640
That will not be necessary.

382
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:08,372
Water is where
you've been called to serve.

383
00:29:08,446 --> 00:29:10,311
Water is where you will be tested.

384
00:29:15,487 --> 00:29:18,217
This will serve
in place of your PT in-test.

385
00:29:18,289 --> 00:29:20,849
This is a golno-go exercise.

386
00:29:22,227 --> 00:29:24,695
You will tread water for one hour.

387
00:29:24,996 --> 00:29:29,330
You touch the wall, you fail.
You touch the bottom, you fail.

388
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:31,425
You fail and you go home.

389
00:29:32,337 --> 00:29:35,500
Senior, this school operates
on a two-challenge rule.

390
00:29:35,573 --> 00:29:37,598
You can't throw them out
on their first day.

391
00:29:37,675 --> 00:29:39,700
If you cannot survive
in a warm pool of water,

392
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:43,145
then you have no business being here.
Does this class understand?

393
00:29:43,214 --> 00:29:44,511
Yes, Senior Chief!

394
00:29:44,582 --> 00:29:46,573
Oorah, Class 5506.

395
00:29:46,651 --> 00:29:49,347
Now, who here can tell me
the rescue swimmer's motto?

396
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:51,251
"So others may live," Senior Chief!

397
00:29:51,322 --> 00:29:53,813
Oh, I feel safer already.

398
00:29:53,892 --> 00:29:56,986
You willing to sacrifice your life
so others may live, Goldfish?

399
00:29:57,061 --> 00:29:58,926
Yes, I am, Senior Chief.

400
00:29:58,997 --> 00:30:03,525
You will have to earn that right.
I want all of you to think about that.

401
00:30:04,936 --> 00:30:07,097
There's going to come a time

402
00:30:07,772 --> 00:30:11,572
when you reach the point of exhaustion
and you wanna give up.

403
00:30:12,043 --> 00:30:15,035
Question is, will you?

404
00:30:25,957 --> 00:30:28,949
There are three letters
that will set you free.

405
00:30:29,027 --> 00:30:32,463
DOR. Drop on Request.

406
00:30:50,315 --> 00:30:51,304
Look at that.

407
00:30:53,051 --> 00:30:54,575
Waste of time.

408
00:31:02,393 --> 00:31:05,021
- You all right?
- Hey. Come on, stay up.

409
00:31:14,272 --> 00:31:15,705
Somebody help him out.

410
00:31:17,475 --> 00:31:19,443
Hey, he's going under, man!

411
00:31:20,545 --> 00:31:21,876
Help him out.

412
00:31:22,547 --> 00:31:24,014
Come on!

413
00:31:28,253 --> 00:31:30,244
- Help him out.
- Help him out!

414
00:31:41,532 --> 00:31:43,227
Guys, relax, man!

415
00:31:43,935 --> 00:31:45,232
Come on.

416
00:31:47,305 --> 00:31:48,795
Come on, man.

417
00:31:49,207 --> 00:31:50,834
You're dismissed.

418
00:31:51,609 --> 00:31:54,134
- I cramped up.
- You're gone.

419
00:31:55,513 --> 00:31:57,140
Let's go, Lyons,
out of the water. Hurry up.

420
00:31:57,215 --> 00:31:59,240
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

421
00:32:01,019 --> 00:32:02,509
On your feet.

422
00:32:03,454 --> 00:32:08,289
muscle does not float.

423
00:32:10,328 --> 00:32:12,762
Petty Officer Watson,
pull them out of the pool.

424
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:13,990
Aye, aye, Senior Chief.

425
00:32:14,065 --> 00:32:15,293
Let's go, people, out of the water.

426
00:32:16,534 --> 00:32:17,762
Hurry up! Let's move, people!

427
00:32:17,835 --> 00:32:20,065
Hurry up! Hurry up!

428
00:32:20,138 --> 00:32:22,106
Class leader, right here.

429
00:32:26,978 --> 00:32:30,573
I thought you said you were willing
to sacrifice your life for another.

430
00:32:31,482 --> 00:32:33,143
I am, Senior Chief.

431
00:32:33,217 --> 00:32:34,775
Then why didn't you
save your teammate

432
00:32:34,852 --> 00:32:36,979
when he reached out for you?

433
00:32:39,390 --> 00:32:42,848
I wasn't aware we were working
as a team, Senior Chief.

434
00:32:43,428 --> 00:32:46,124
That's the only way we work,
swim champ.

435
00:32:49,667 --> 00:32:51,601
Aye, aye, Senior Chief.

436
00:33:03,715 --> 00:33:05,046
Asshole.

437
00:33:05,116 --> 00:33:07,243
- Come again?
- You heard me.

438
00:33:07,318 --> 00:33:09,684
Hey, hey, hey! Ease up! Ease up!

439
00:33:10,621 --> 00:33:12,145
- It's not worth it.
- Come on.

440
00:33:12,223 --> 00:33:14,748
Good news, Lyons. I think there's
an opening on my buoy tender.

441
00:33:14,826 --> 00:33:17,124
I'll put in a word for you, huh?

442
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:21,962
I'm really gonna miss that guy.

443
00:33:27,705 --> 00:33:31,004
- Hey, man, what are you doing?
- Got your bunk back.

444
00:33:37,582 --> 00:33:39,743
- Captain.
- Ben. Come in.

445
00:33:40,485 --> 00:33:41,884
You work fast.

446
00:33:41,953 --> 00:33:44,683
Lyons,
he was one of our top candidates.

447
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:47,990
Sometimes you gotta shoot a hostage.

448
00:33:48,059 --> 00:33:51,460
Look, we all know
that you're a legend and all,

449
00:33:52,497 --> 00:33:55,091
but our program
has been proven to work.

450
00:33:55,166 --> 00:33:58,294
There's a gap between training and
what really happens out there, Cujo.

451
00:33:58,369 --> 00:33:59,768
- Oh, really?
- That's right.

452
00:33:59,837 --> 00:34:01,270
My intention is to narrow that gap.

453
00:34:01,339 --> 00:34:04,331
Now, if someone has a problem
with that idea,

454
00:34:05,009 --> 00:34:07,034
I'd like to hear about it.

455
00:34:11,516 --> 00:34:13,814
Is this how it's gonna be, sir?

456
00:34:16,654 --> 00:34:18,019
Yes, it is.

457
00:34:19,357 --> 00:34:22,554
- Permission to be dismissed, sir?
- Granted.

458
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:32,092
Let's go. Let's go.
Keep it together. Look tight!

459
00:34:32,170 --> 00:34:34,035
Keep it together. Let's go. Let's move.

460
00:34:34,105 --> 00:34:37,734
You've got three minutes
to get this gear on. All of it.

461
00:34:38,109 --> 00:34:39,406
Set! Go!

462
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:43,969
Let's go.

463
00:34:48,419 --> 00:34:50,011
Are you ready?

464
00:34:55,326 --> 00:34:57,123
Come on, rescue swimmer!

465
00:34:59,530 --> 00:35:00,895
Don't quit on me.

466
00:35:16,447 --> 00:35:18,278
Do you hear me?

467
00:35:18,349 --> 00:35:19,748
Do you hear me?

468
00:35:20,017 --> 00:35:23,578
Pop tall! Pop tall! Pop tall!

469
00:35:26,357 --> 00:35:31,090
If you make a mistake, just fess up to it.
Take your licks and we'll press on.

470
00:35:31,362 --> 00:35:34,854
Everybody now is gonna pay
for your potty mouth.

471
00:35:34,932 --> 00:35:38,026
- Down. Up.
- One!

472
00:35:38,102 --> 00:35:39,262
Down.

473
00:35:39,337 --> 00:35:40,599
- Up.
- Three!

474
00:35:40,671 --> 00:35:42,070
Down. Up.

475
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:43,835
Five! Six!

476
00:35:43,908 --> 00:35:45,500
- Forward.
- Seven!

477
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:50,742
Are you crazy?

478
00:35:50,948 --> 00:35:52,643
I'm the commander! Get up!

479
00:35:52,717 --> 00:35:55,185
- Oorah!
- Get down! Get down!

480
00:35:56,087 --> 00:35:57,111
Oorah!

481
00:36:04,695 --> 00:36:05,684
Go.

482
00:36:20,044 --> 00:36:21,033
Oorah.

483
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:23,769
Oorah.

484
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:25,171
Oorah!

485
00:36:44,435 --> 00:36:46,903
Can you die from chlorine poisoning?

486
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:49,730
I can't feel my legs. I'm serious.

487
00:36:50,775 --> 00:36:53,175
I don't know about you guys,
but I feel good.

488
00:36:53,244 --> 00:36:56,304
This Randall guy, he's operating
on some whole other cylinder.

489
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:59,372
What is it, two weeks, and he's failed
almost half the class already?

490
00:36:59,450 --> 00:37:00,849
He's a legend.

491
00:37:00,918 --> 00:37:02,749
They say he's got
something like 200 saves.

492
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:04,583
I heard it was 300.

493
00:37:04,655 --> 00:37:06,646
Who cares what his number is?

494
00:37:06,724 --> 00:37:09,192
If he's such a stud,
what's he doing here?

495
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:10,887
How we feeling, boys?

496
00:37:11,495 --> 00:37:12,894
Hey, Z, where you going?

497
00:37:12,964 --> 00:37:15,831
My sister's best friend
is getting married,

498
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:17,765
and they're having
a big reception downtown.

499
00:37:17,835 --> 00:37:19,700
I promised her I'd go.

500
00:37:20,371 --> 00:37:22,601
Wait, you said wedding reception?

501
00:37:41,425 --> 00:37:43,120
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

502
00:37:43,194 --> 00:37:44,183
Hi.

503
00:37:44,462 --> 00:37:46,293
- Congratulations.
- Hi.

504
00:37:46,364 --> 00:37:47,353
Nice to meet you.

505
00:37:47,765 --> 00:37:52,202
Yes, Kodiak, Alaska.
The number for Helen Randall.

506
00:37:56,007 --> 00:37:58,441
Okay, try Helen Freeman.

507
00:38:01,312 --> 00:38:02,711
You betcha.

508
00:38:08,853 --> 00:38:11,321
<i>Hi, you've reached
Helen. Leave a message.</i>

509
00:38:12,223 --> 00:38:14,885
<i>Helen, it's Ben.
Jesus, that was weird.</i>

510
00:38:15,459 --> 00:38:18,917
<i>Haven't had to use your maiden name
since we were kids.</i>

511
00:38:19,463 --> 00:38:22,921
Helen, if you're there, just pick up.
We need to talk.

512
00:38:26,637 --> 00:38:27,626
<i>Please.</i>

513
00:38:40,051 --> 00:38:41,848
All right. All right.

514
00:38:42,486 --> 00:38:45,887
To those who have fallen,
to those who have survived Phase 1.

515
00:38:45,956 --> 00:38:47,753
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

516
00:38:47,825 --> 00:38:51,056
- Oorah, oorah, oorah.
- Guys, this is great.

517
00:38:51,128 --> 00:38:55,758
And to our gal Lindsey.
You can rescue me anytime.

518
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:58,165
- Did he just say that?
- You did not just say that.

519
00:38:58,235 --> 00:38:59,964
- Did he just say that?
- You did not just say that.

520
00:39:00,037 --> 00:39:03,973
You know what, Doran?
You, I think I might actually let drown.

521
00:39:04,542 --> 00:39:06,271
Oh!

522
00:39:15,486 --> 00:39:17,249
Hey, Senior Chief.

523
00:39:18,723 --> 00:39:20,782
Ben, she's hot tonight.

524
00:39:27,498 --> 00:39:29,489
This place has not changed.

525
00:39:33,838 --> 00:39:36,398
<i>- From Kodiak, Alaska...
- Don't.</i>

526
00:39:36,474 --> 00:39:40,103
<i>... Senior Chief Ben Randall
is in the house,</i>

527
00:39:40,177 --> 00:39:42,543
<i>big as day and still alive.</i>

528
00:39:42,613 --> 00:39:44,843
<i>I must owe somebody money.</i>

529
00:39:46,450 --> 00:39:48,884
- You're terrible.
- Oh, Ben.

530
00:39:50,521 --> 00:39:53,649
I heard a rumor you were gonna be
teaching here in town.

531
00:39:53,724 --> 00:39:56,989
If that ain't the karmic wheel spinning,
I don't know what is.

532
00:39:57,795 --> 00:40:01,731
Well. To the prodigal's return.

533
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:06,400
- Where's your better half?
- She decided to stay home.

534
00:40:07,138 --> 00:40:09,299
- Oh.
- Work stuff.

535
00:40:10,174 --> 00:40:14,634
Yeah. Winter in Kodiak.
Let me see. Winter in Louisiana.

536
00:40:14,712 --> 00:40:17,203
- All right, stop. Stop.
- "She decided to stay home."

537
00:40:18,382 --> 00:40:21,476
Well, it's a good thing
we got a full bottle and half the night.

538
00:40:21,552 --> 00:40:22,951
Yes, we do.

539
00:40:25,689 --> 00:40:28,453
Check it out. She's staring at you.

540
00:40:29,193 --> 00:40:30,854
That girl right there
is not staring at me.

541
00:40:30,928 --> 00:40:32,725
Did you just point at her?

542
00:40:32,797 --> 00:40:34,924
- Did she see you point?
- I don't know.

543
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:39,030
All right, now you gotta go talk to her.
You gotta go make a move.

544
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:41,071
- Yeah.
- I can't.

545
00:40:41,138 --> 00:40:44,073
I just don't feel comfortable right now
talking to women.

546
00:40:44,141 --> 00:40:46,075
You're telling me
you wanna jump out of helicopters

547
00:40:46,143 --> 00:40:47,474
- for a living...
- You're talking to me.

548
00:40:47,545 --> 00:40:48,876
...but you can't go talk to a girl?

549
00:40:48,946 --> 00:40:51,608
- That's exactly what I was telling you.
- You're smooth.

550
00:40:51,682 --> 00:40:53,547
All right, look,
I'm gonna help you out here.

551
00:40:53,617 --> 00:40:55,551
I'll show you how it's done.

552
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:59,253
Pick out the hottest girl in here.
I'll take her home.

553
00:40:59,323 --> 00:41:00,847
- Oh, gosh.
- Okay.

554
00:41:00,925 --> 00:41:04,383
- Here he go, now.
- No, how about I will find the girl?

555
00:41:04,495 --> 00:41:05,621
All right.

556
00:41:06,664 --> 00:41:08,598
- Okey-doke.
- Who you thinking?

557
00:41:08,666 --> 00:41:10,429
Make sure she's hot.

558
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:13,528
- Where you looking?
- Okay.

559
00:41:13,604 --> 00:41:16,038
At the bar. Two o'clock.

560
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:22,201
- Yes.
- That's a good one.

561
00:41:22,546 --> 00:41:24,138
There's no way in hell
she's talking to you.

562
00:41:24,215 --> 00:41:25,944
- That one?
- Yeah, that one.

563
00:41:26,116 --> 00:41:28,676
Hundred bucks says
she shuts you down

564
00:41:28,752 --> 00:41:30,219
in less than a minute.

565
00:41:31,088 --> 00:41:32,146
Boom.

566
00:41:32,223 --> 00:41:35,192
- That looks like a bet to me, Jake.
- That's a bet.

567
00:41:38,195 --> 00:41:40,595
All right. All right.

568
00:41:40,664 --> 00:41:43,827
Hundred bucks says I close
in less than a minute.

569
00:41:43,901 --> 00:41:45,459
Oh, absolutely.

570
00:41:48,672 --> 00:41:51,732
- Hats off, man.
- Tick-tock. Tick-tock. Tick-tock.

571
00:41:51,809 --> 00:41:53,800
Clock starts when I talk to her.

572
00:41:53,878 --> 00:41:54,902
That's fine.

573
00:41:54,979 --> 00:41:55,968
This is
gonna be embarrassing.

574
00:41:56,046 --> 00:41:57,070
All right, buddy.

575
00:41:57,147 --> 00:41:58,409
What do you think?
What do you got?

576
00:41:58,482 --> 00:42:00,541
- You think he's gonna do it?
- Yeah.

577
00:42:05,122 --> 00:42:07,716
Evening, ma'am.
Can I buy you a drink?

578
00:42:10,961 --> 00:42:12,724
I don't think so.

579
00:42:14,265 --> 00:42:16,756
You don't know what you're missing.

580
00:42:20,738 --> 00:42:22,968
You sure you wanna go with that one?

581
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:25,634
That's, like, your top-of-the-line,
A-game material?

582
00:42:28,579 --> 00:42:31,673
See, the way I see it,
you got two choices here:

583
00:42:32,983 --> 00:42:34,211
walk away from me,

584
00:42:34,285 --> 00:42:36,753
or walk out of here with me
and split the cash.

585
00:42:38,556 --> 00:42:39,545
Cash?

586
00:42:41,425 --> 00:42:42,790
What cash?

587
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:46,193
The money you bet your friends
you could pick me up.

588
00:42:48,699 --> 00:42:50,496
See, that makes me nervous.

589
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:52,126
She's shutting him down.

590
00:42:54,572 --> 00:42:56,767
How much time you got left?

591
00:42:58,776 --> 00:43:01,472
- About 20 seconds.
- Shall we?

592
00:43:04,381 --> 00:43:05,848
- Oh, my gosh.
- No way.

593
00:43:05,916 --> 00:43:08,384
It looks like they're leaving
the bar together, is what I see.

594
00:43:08,452 --> 00:43:10,079
No way!

595
00:43:10,154 --> 00:43:11,644
You have got to be kidding me.

596
00:43:11,722 --> 00:43:13,212
- Unbelievable.
- How did he do that?

597
00:43:13,290 --> 00:43:15,315
- I'm impressed.
- I'm impressed.

598
00:43:15,926 --> 00:43:19,089
There's a bar outside your base
called Maggie's. You know it?

599
00:43:19,163 --> 00:43:20,221
Yeah.

600
00:43:20,297 --> 00:43:23,494
Good. Meet me there next Friday
around 8:00?

601
00:43:23,567 --> 00:43:25,660
- You got a name?
- Yeah.

602
00:43:26,303 --> 00:43:28,168
Don't forget my money.

603
00:43:33,277 --> 00:43:35,142
You got a middle name?

604
00:43:37,848 --> 00:43:40,544
You do realize I can't go back in there.

605
00:43:44,455 --> 00:43:46,116
<i>This is the sound of death knocking.</i>

606
00:43:46,190 --> 00:43:48,954
<i>SAR alarms and sleep deprivation
are part...</i>

607
00:43:50,995 --> 00:43:52,963
Where the hell are they?

608
00:44:05,109 --> 00:44:09,045
You know, the first stages
of hypothermia are the most critical.

609
00:44:09,113 --> 00:44:10,102
Why?

610
00:44:11,048 --> 00:44:14,074
Because you still have
the ability to think. Say it.

611
00:44:14,151 --> 00:44:17,314
You still have
the ability to think.

612
00:44:17,388 --> 00:44:20,186
The decisions you make
during this stage

613
00:44:20,257 --> 00:44:24,091
are gonna determine
whether you live or die.

614
00:44:24,294 --> 00:44:26,558
There a reason
you're not breathing, Goldfish?

615
00:44:27,364 --> 00:44:29,127
Is there a reason
why you're not breathing?

616
00:44:30,601 --> 00:44:33,092
I don't know anyone
who can stay alive without breathing

617
00:44:33,170 --> 00:44:34,967
for 15 minutes, Senior Chief.

618
00:44:35,039 --> 00:44:36,700
Are you a coroner?

619
00:44:37,741 --> 00:44:41,040
Because pronouncing people dead
is not part of our job description.

620
00:44:41,111 --> 00:44:42,601
What do we always say?

621
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:45,148
There's dead
and then there's dead.

622
00:44:46,316 --> 00:44:49,877
We never stop, Jake,
not from the cabin to the tarmac.

623
00:44:49,953 --> 00:44:51,978
- We never stop.
- Aye, aye, Senior Chief.

624
00:44:52,056 --> 00:44:54,718
- Understood?
- Yes, Senior Chief.

625
00:44:54,792 --> 00:44:57,590
Okay, Jake, in the pool.
Hodge, you're up.

626
00:44:57,795 --> 00:44:59,126
You're with the dummy.

627
00:45:01,165 --> 00:45:03,360
All right, now. Three letters.

628
00:45:03,867 --> 00:45:07,200
Three letters will get you people
a cup of hot coffee and a blanket.

629
00:45:09,139 --> 00:45:11,130
What do you say, Goldfish?

630
00:45:11,809 --> 00:45:14,437
I'm actually not that cold anymore,
Senior Chief.

631
00:45:14,511 --> 00:45:18,003
You're not cold anymore
because blood is moving

632
00:45:18,082 --> 00:45:20,346
from your outer extremities
to your heart.

633
00:45:20,417 --> 00:45:22,749
That's why your arms won't work.

634
00:45:23,287 --> 00:45:26,950
You can plan on spending
roughly 60% of your career

635
00:45:27,024 --> 00:45:28,958
in a mildly hypothermic state.

636
00:45:29,293 --> 00:45:31,625
Senior Chief, may I have a word?

637
00:45:45,843 --> 00:45:46,832
Sir?

638
00:45:48,345 --> 00:45:51,337
Why wasn't I informed of this?
You know, we have classrooms.

639
00:45:51,415 --> 00:45:55,215
Your assignment is to simply teach
the stages of hypothermia.

640
00:45:55,352 --> 00:46:00,847
Sir, in about two and a half minutes,
they'll understand.

641
00:46:04,595 --> 00:46:06,722
Permission to carry on, sir?

642
00:46:08,799 --> 00:46:09,788
Go ahead.

643
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:27,815
Three letters, people, will get you
a hot cup of coffee and a warm blanket.

644
00:46:28,886 --> 00:46:31,684
What do you say, Class 5506?

645
00:46:32,322 --> 00:46:33,914
Oorah.

646
00:46:42,599 --> 00:46:45,796
<i>This is an oxygen-deprivation
anaerobic exercise.</i>

647
00:46:46,537 --> 00:46:48,903
<i>You and your partner
will push your brick</i>

648
00:46:48,972 --> 00:46:52,430
<i>along the bottom of the pool,
down and back.</i>

649
00:46:53,844 --> 00:46:57,109
<i>If you need air, you may surface.
One breath.</i>

650
00:46:58,248 --> 00:47:01,615
<i>Your partner must remain underwater
until you return.</i>

651
00:47:02,986 --> 00:47:07,013
<i>Your brick can only move
while both of you are touching it.</i>

652
00:47:08,425 --> 00:47:11,861
<i>If you both surface, you both fail.</i>

653
00:47:12,996 --> 00:47:16,261
<i>This exercise is designed
to teach you teamwork.</i>

654
00:47:17,067 --> 00:47:20,935
<i>On my whistle, drop your gear,
enter the pool and pair up.</i>

655
00:47:52,202 --> 00:47:54,830
I said one breath, Sunkist. Let's go!

656
00:47:55,606 --> 00:47:56,698
- I can't.
- Come on!

657
00:47:56,773 --> 00:47:57,967
- I can't.
- "I can't."

658
00:47:58,041 --> 00:48:00,703
Get your ass out of the pool! Let's go!

659
00:48:02,713 --> 00:48:04,772
Come on! Lean and rest.

660
00:48:04,848 --> 00:48:07,840
You wanna quit, just quit now.
I could use those new shoes.

661
00:48:07,918 --> 00:48:10,182
Senior Chief, we got a problem.

662
00:48:11,088 --> 00:48:13,056
Somebody's missing.

663
00:48:18,495 --> 00:48:19,962
Jesus Christ.

664
00:48:29,873 --> 00:48:32,501
That's gotta be a new record. Oorah.

665
00:48:33,911 --> 00:48:36,778
I'm so sick of records. Go get him.

666
00:48:56,166 --> 00:49:00,296
You think I'm impressed because
you can hold your breath, Goldfish?

667
00:49:02,306 --> 00:49:06,208
I wouldn't venture to say
what would impress you, Senior Chief.

668
00:49:12,416 --> 00:49:14,976
All right. Get him out of the pool.
We're done for the day.

669
00:49:15,052 --> 00:49:17,714
Out of the pool, Fischer. Let's move.

670
00:49:22,092 --> 00:49:24,117
- Oorah!
- Move your ass.

671
00:49:26,496 --> 00:49:27,622
Pop tall, Sunkist.

672
00:49:27,698 --> 00:49:29,290
Out of the pool.
Out of the pool.

673
00:49:36,807 --> 00:49:37,796
Records.

674
00:49:40,344 --> 00:49:42,835
Never stare
directly into the flame, people.

675
00:49:42,913 --> 00:49:44,847
It will impair your night vision.

676
00:49:44,915 --> 00:49:48,749
This is a Mark 58 flare.
This is what it looks like.

677
00:49:49,319 --> 00:49:51,651
It'll light up a 50-foot swath of water

678
00:49:51,722 --> 00:49:54,589
and can be detected by infrared
miles out.

679
00:49:56,560 --> 00:49:58,289
This is a demonstration model.

680
00:49:58,362 --> 00:50:01,024
The normal one will burn
for 40 to 60 minutes.

681
00:50:01,098 --> 00:50:02,759
Hey, pay attention.

682
00:50:02,833 --> 00:50:07,668
The Mark 58 is used to reference
the wind, to detect a current.

683
00:50:07,738 --> 00:50:10,332
Petty Officer Watson is gonna talk
a little bit more about that.

684
00:50:12,476 --> 00:50:14,068
<i>Five minutes.</i>

685
00:50:20,550 --> 00:50:22,575
The vessel you're looking
at right now,

686
00:50:22,652 --> 00:50:24,244
people, is listing to the port side.

687
00:50:24,321 --> 00:50:26,915
As a rescue swimmer, when you get
to the door of the helicopter,

688
00:50:26,990 --> 00:50:28,753
you need to look down
and pay attention

689
00:50:28,825 --> 00:50:31,191
to what you really have down there.

690
00:50:31,261 --> 00:50:34,788
It's very important
that you understand your limitations.

691
00:50:34,865 --> 00:50:38,494
Limitations without understanding
are gonna get you killed.

692
00:50:38,568 --> 00:50:42,800
Case in point, this vessel's trapped
in pancake ice in the Bering Sea.

693
00:50:43,140 --> 00:50:45,040
And as you can see,
the crew are out on the deck

694
00:50:45,108 --> 00:50:47,838
in a relatively manageable
hoisting position.

695
00:50:47,911 --> 00:50:49,503
But suddenly...

696
00:50:51,348 --> 00:50:54,408
Those pieces of ice can weigh in
upwards of thousands of pounds.

697
00:50:54,484 --> 00:50:59,217
Now imagine yourself trapped
in between 2,000-pound pieces of ice

698
00:50:59,289 --> 00:51:00,916
trying to free-swim.

699
00:51:00,991 --> 00:51:02,083
Thank you, Chief.

700
00:51:02,159 --> 00:51:04,719
Next scenario, Petty Officer Watson.

701
00:51:05,295 --> 00:51:07,786
Before you leave
that helicopter, going down to a...

702
00:51:07,864 --> 00:51:12,767
Standardization is one of the reasons
we were so successful during Katrina.

703
00:51:12,836 --> 00:51:15,737
We had crews come in
from all over the country,

704
00:51:15,806 --> 00:51:19,242
but it didn't matter, because we have
all been trained the same way.

705
00:51:19,309 --> 00:51:22,039
I didn't know my pilot,
I didn't know my copilot,

706
00:51:22,112 --> 00:51:24,137
I didn't know my flight mechanic.
But guess what?

707
00:51:24,214 --> 00:51:25,613
It didn't matter, because...

708
00:51:25,682 --> 00:51:26,808
That's why we do it.

709
00:51:26,883 --> 00:51:29,374
So you have to get your mind
wrapped around that idea.

710
00:51:29,453 --> 00:51:33,253
When that helicopter starts going,
when the wind starts coming...

711
00:51:33,323 --> 00:51:35,154
Twenty!
Down! Up!

712
00:51:35,225 --> 00:51:36,988
- Twenty-one!
- Down! Up!

713
00:51:37,060 --> 00:51:38,960
- Twenty-two!
- Down! Up!

714
00:51:39,029 --> 00:51:41,020
<i>Twenty-three!</i>

715
00:51:41,098 --> 00:51:42,588
- Two!
- Down!

716
00:51:42,666 --> 00:51:44,224
- Up!
- Three!

717
00:51:45,402 --> 00:51:47,495
<i>Don't need no land
Don't need no tree</i>

718
00:51:47,604 --> 00:51:50,038
<i>Out in the water
That's where I wanna be</i>

719
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:06,187
- Hey, Mags, can I have a beer?
- Sure.

720
00:52:08,058 --> 00:52:10,083
Well, well.

721
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:12,954
So you are gonna
have a drink with me.

722
00:52:13,029 --> 00:52:16,795
No, I'm having a drink near you.
Entirely different thing.

723
00:52:19,002 --> 00:52:21,869
You're a regular lightning rod,
aren't you?

724
00:52:22,472 --> 00:52:26,135
- What's your name?
- Daisy Buchanan.

725
00:52:27,677 --> 00:52:29,542
You're lying, Daisy Buchanan.

726
00:52:30,447 --> 00:52:32,972
- There is that possibility.
- No.

727
00:52:33,049 --> 00:52:35,040
That was a sure-fire lie.

728
00:52:35,118 --> 00:52:37,951
<i>So I take it
you've read The Great Gatsby.</i>

729
00:52:39,856 --> 00:52:43,314
- Where's my money?
- It's not on me.

730
00:52:44,060 --> 00:52:47,188
But it is close. In a very safe place.

731
00:52:47,564 --> 00:52:52,160
Now, I've drawn a map
with a complex set of clues.

732
00:52:52,869 --> 00:52:56,032
Each one is more fiendishly clever
than the last.

733
00:53:01,011 --> 00:53:02,569
That works, too.

734
00:53:03,947 --> 00:53:06,313
This is just a picture of your pants.

735
00:53:06,383 --> 00:53:10,911
Yeah, but it's a bad picture, which is
what makes it so fiendishly clever.

736
00:53:11,254 --> 00:53:12,243
Nice.

737
00:53:12,322 --> 00:53:14,688
How did Emily Thomas
become a schoolteacher?

738
00:53:14,758 --> 00:53:16,658
Well, how does Jake Fischer
become a guy

739
00:53:16,726 --> 00:53:19,194
who wants to jump out of helicopters?

740
00:53:20,463 --> 00:53:23,762
I killed a couple guys
and had to get out of Dodge.

741
00:53:25,468 --> 00:53:28,562
- You're lying.
- There is that possibility.

742
00:53:31,007 --> 00:53:32,133
The truth.

743
00:53:33,109 --> 00:53:35,703
My bull-riding career
was going down the drain.

744
00:53:35,779 --> 00:53:39,545
- Okay, that's better.
- All right, now you.

745
00:53:43,687 --> 00:53:45,484
I really should go.

746
00:53:45,555 --> 00:53:47,785
Go? What? No, you're not going.

747
00:53:47,857 --> 00:53:50,291
We're just starting to have fun.
You're insulting my drawing.

748
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:52,260
No, you were insulting your drawing.

749
00:53:52,329 --> 00:53:54,263
Although, to be fair,
it's a pretty lame drawing.

750
00:53:54,331 --> 00:53:56,822
All right. Well, you can't go,
'cause you owe me a dance.

751
00:53:56,900 --> 00:53:58,060
No, I don't think so.

752
00:53:58,134 --> 00:53:59,931
Well, then, I'm gonna
have to take that money back,

753
00:54:00,003 --> 00:54:01,698
'cause I wouldn't feel right
taking the money...

754
00:54:01,771 --> 00:54:03,966
Look, every 18 weeks,
a new bunch of you guys comes in,

755
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:06,167
all looking to score with the local talent.

756
00:54:06,243 --> 00:54:08,336
I live here. I work here.

757
00:54:09,980 --> 00:54:13,279
It's a good thing
I'm just asking for a dance, then.

758
00:54:15,485 --> 00:54:17,112
Okay, one dance.

759
00:54:18,888 --> 00:54:22,016
No attachments. Just casual.

760
00:54:22,592 --> 00:54:25,356
I'm a guy. I can do casual.

761
00:54:25,662 --> 00:54:26,856
Mmm-hmm.

762
00:54:26,930 --> 00:54:29,228
I am the king of casual.

763
00:54:31,601 --> 00:54:33,262
There's just one thing, though.

764
00:54:34,304 --> 00:54:36,966
You're gonna have to stop
undressing me with your eyes,

765
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:39,838
'cause there's no way
you're getting me into bed.

766
00:55:22,719 --> 00:55:23,981
Hey, you.

767
00:55:26,790 --> 00:55:28,621
I gotta get to work.

768
00:55:29,793 --> 00:55:32,489
- I'm late. I fell asleep.
- What...

769
00:55:32,562 --> 00:55:34,291
- They're gonna kill me.
- They won't kill you.

770
00:55:34,364 --> 00:55:35,388
This isn't like school.

771
00:55:35,465 --> 00:55:37,797
They don't hand out tardies
in the military.

772
00:55:39,636 --> 00:55:42,434
- You smell really good.
- I smell like you.

773
00:55:48,778 --> 00:55:50,939
- He never came back?
- Nope.

774
00:55:51,881 --> 00:55:53,314
Wow.

775
00:55:53,383 --> 00:55:57,046
Four years as lead instructor,
I never had one go missing.

776
00:55:58,388 --> 00:56:01,050
All right, take the others to the pool.
I'll catch up.

777
00:56:01,124 --> 00:56:02,785
Aye, aye, Senior.

778
00:56:20,009 --> 00:56:22,409
Oh, God, there they are.
Stop. Stop the car. Stop.

779
00:56:22,479 --> 00:56:23,468
- Here?
- Yes.

780
00:56:23,546 --> 00:56:24,570
- Okay.
- I'll call you.

781
00:56:24,647 --> 00:56:25,739
You better. Bye.

782
00:56:28,151 --> 00:56:29,641
Jake! Jake! Jake!

783
00:56:29,753 --> 00:56:32,779
<i>Airman Fischer's
coming in late, yeah</i>

784
00:56:32,856 --> 00:56:33,845
Here.

785
00:56:33,923 --> 00:56:36,824
<i>Airman Fischer's
coming in late, yeah</i>

786
00:56:36,893 --> 00:56:37,882
Hi.

787
00:56:41,731 --> 00:56:44,791
<i>Must be nice to go out on a date, yeah</i>

788
00:56:44,868 --> 00:56:47,894
<i>Must be nice to go out on a date, yeah</i>

789
00:56:48,638 --> 00:56:50,902
Oh, my goodness, look at this.

790
00:56:52,409 --> 00:56:55,674
Look at this.
"Freshman Leads Team to State Title."

791
00:56:57,380 --> 00:56:58,745
That's you.

792
00:56:59,549 --> 00:57:00,573
Holy smokes.

793
00:57:00,650 --> 00:57:04,882
"At only 16, Jake Fischer displays
the traits of a seasoned athlete.

794
00:57:05,688 --> 00:57:10,182
"One thing's for sure: the future
looks bright for this young competitor."

795
00:57:11,494 --> 00:57:15,362
Guess they didn't know
you were gonna flunk out of "A" School.

796
00:57:18,501 --> 00:57:20,492
You have a nice evening?

797
00:57:22,806 --> 00:57:24,239
Get dressed.

798
00:57:43,993 --> 00:57:46,757
Think we need another brick.
Bring it in.

799
00:57:49,432 --> 00:57:50,694
Goldfish.

800
00:57:53,136 --> 00:57:54,433
Goldfish.

801
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:07,607
Thanks to Mr. Fischer's
extracurricular activities,

802
00:58:07,684 --> 00:58:10,983
you have all now gone 36 hours
without sleep.

803
00:58:12,388 --> 00:58:13,514
Blow it.

804
00:58:18,294 --> 00:58:21,457
Class leader, you are done.
Form it up in the shallow end.

805
00:58:21,531 --> 00:58:22,691
Aye, Senior Chief!

806
00:58:22,765 --> 00:58:25,461
Class 5506, form it up!

807
00:58:25,902 --> 00:58:30,430
No. No, no, no. You're with me.

808
00:58:34,644 --> 00:58:37,340
<i>I'm a rescue swimmer, yes, I am</i>

809
00:58:37,413 --> 00:58:39,745
<i>I'm here to pull your ass out of this jam</i>

810
00:58:39,816 --> 00:58:42,080
<i>I jump from the helo
and swing from the cable</i>

811
00:58:42,151 --> 00:58:44,142
All right, knock it off.

812
00:58:45,054 --> 00:58:47,682
I am having a hard time
figuring you out, Fischer.

813
00:58:48,525 --> 00:58:51,790
I mean, you like seeing your picture
in the paper.

814
00:58:52,161 --> 00:58:55,062
In it for the glory, maybe a few chicks.
Am I right?

815
00:58:55,131 --> 00:58:56,564
But when it comes down to it,

816
00:58:56,633 --> 00:58:59,466
you will choose yourself over them
every time,

817
00:58:59,536 --> 00:59:02,369
like you did on the first day in the pool,

818
00:59:02,839 --> 00:59:05,637
like you did yesterday
by missing muster.

819
00:59:05,708 --> 00:59:08,142
Won't happen again, Senior Chief!

820
00:59:08,545 --> 00:59:11,742
Why don't you do us both a big favor
and quit?

821
00:59:12,882 --> 00:59:15,544
<i>I'm a rescue swimmer, yes, I am</i>

822
00:59:16,319 --> 00:59:18,810
<i>I'm here to pull your ass out of this jam</i>

823
00:59:18,888 --> 00:59:21,880
<i>I jump from the helo
and swing from the cable</i>

824
00:59:22,458 --> 00:59:25,586
<i>I'm not Tarzan
I'm just willing and able</i>

825
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,560
Give me something else, Senior Chief.

826
00:59:34,203 --> 00:59:35,465
Thirty!

827
00:59:36,372 --> 00:59:37,771
Thirty-one!

828
00:59:38,708 --> 00:59:39,868
Thirty-two!

829
00:59:40,843 --> 00:59:41,832
Thirty-three!

830
00:59:43,346 --> 00:59:44,643
Thirty-four!

831
00:59:45,982 --> 00:59:47,381
Thirty-five!

832
00:59:48,017 --> 00:59:49,382
Thirty-six!

833
00:59:49,619 --> 00:59:51,382
Stop. Drop them.

834
00:59:51,454 --> 00:59:53,888
Senior Chief's on deck. Pop tall.

835
00:59:55,391 --> 00:59:56,858
Oorah!

836
00:59:59,929 --> 01:00:01,089
Morning, class.

837
01:00:01,164 --> 01:00:02,529
Today we were going to learn

838
01:00:02,599 --> 01:00:06,501
about how to approach
a drowning victim in high seas,

839
01:00:08,538 --> 01:00:11,530
but I think there are some here
who aren't interested in that victim.

840
01:00:11,608 --> 01:00:13,200
Fact, I think there's some in this class

841
01:00:13,276 --> 01:00:16,245
who aren't interested
in saving lives at all.

842
01:00:17,246 --> 01:00:19,612
I believe there are some

843
01:00:19,682 --> 01:00:22,651
who are more interested
in setting records.

844
01:00:23,019 --> 01:00:25,715
So today is record day.

845
01:00:39,335 --> 01:00:41,235
5:28.

846
01:00:41,337 --> 01:00:43,635
Put one on the board for Goldfish.

847
01:00:48,444 --> 01:00:50,275
Wow, he's fast.

848
01:00:52,415 --> 01:00:54,212
He's good.

849
01:00:58,521 --> 01:01:00,682
You got it, man! You got it, Fisch!

850
01:01:00,857 --> 01:01:04,224
Another record. Chalk it up, Chief.

851
01:01:04,293 --> 01:01:06,853
- Get some.
- You are the man!

852
01:01:06,929 --> 01:01:10,262
You people do not deserve
to be in the same pool as Jake.

853
01:01:10,333 --> 01:01:12,233
He's destroying you.

854
01:01:14,771 --> 01:01:17,672
Wow, look at him go! He's fast!

855
01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:19,467
Wow, he's fast.

856
01:01:19,542 --> 01:01:22,841
Come on, you're all fighting for second.
Just first loser.

857
01:01:22,912 --> 01:01:23,936
This is fun.

858
01:01:24,013 --> 01:01:26,072
We'll pass out trophies later.

859
01:01:32,021 --> 01:01:33,579
Unbelievable.

860
01:01:37,293 --> 01:01:38,783
Unbelievable.

861
01:01:42,098 --> 01:01:44,760
You want me to pull these pansies out?

862
01:01:51,507 --> 01:01:54,965
- You do not wanna hear about my day.
- Yeah, I do.

863
01:01:58,081 --> 01:02:00,140
Man, this guy Randall...

864
01:02:00,216 --> 01:02:04,346
You know, it doesn't matter what I do.
It's just not good enough.

865
01:02:04,420 --> 01:02:06,854
Well, maybe he's just trying
to push you to be better.

866
01:02:06,923 --> 01:02:09,323
You know, we teachers do that
to the ones we believe in.

867
01:02:09,392 --> 01:02:11,656
No, it's personal with me.

868
01:02:12,295 --> 01:02:14,559
He knows that I'm better than he was.

869
01:02:14,697 --> 01:02:17,825
I mean, today,
I broke every one of his records.

870
01:02:17,900 --> 01:02:19,800
I own them all.

871
01:02:20,169 --> 01:02:21,693
Not all of them.

872
01:02:21,771 --> 01:02:24,262
There's one record you won't break.

873
01:02:25,341 --> 01:02:27,036
<i>This is the Aegis.</i>

874
01:02:28,377 --> 01:02:30,572
Medical ship. Caught on fire.

875
01:02:31,447 --> 01:02:33,938
It was a nightmare.
People burning in their beds.

876
01:02:34,016 --> 01:02:36,678
And Ben Randall
got every one of those people off there,

877
01:02:36,753 --> 01:02:38,186
except for this one guy.

878
01:02:38,254 --> 01:02:40,620
And right when the ship
started to go down,

879
01:02:40,690 --> 01:02:42,988
he reaches down and grabs this guy.

880
01:02:43,259 --> 01:02:46,422
He's hanging from the cable
with this man's life in his hands,

881
01:02:46,496 --> 01:02:47,963
and the winch jams.

882
01:02:48,030 --> 01:02:51,557
It's 20 minutes to the base.
The man's screaming.

883
01:02:52,001 --> 01:02:54,799
Ben looks him dead in the eye,
and you know what he said?

884
01:02:54,871 --> 01:02:56,600
He said, "I won't let go."

885
01:02:56,672 --> 01:02:57,934
What happened?

886
01:02:58,007 --> 01:03:01,135
Dislocated his shoulder,
tore every tendon in his hand.

887
01:03:01,210 --> 01:03:02,677
But he didn't let go.

888
01:03:02,745 --> 01:03:05,612
Twenty minutes, just fingertips.

889
01:03:06,249 --> 01:03:09,446
You break that record
and you give me a call.

890
01:03:24,200 --> 01:03:25,599
My day was all right.

891
01:04:37,707 --> 01:04:41,541
So here's my thinking.
We should go on a date.

892
01:04:43,012 --> 01:04:45,173
- Well, what do you call this?
- No, no, no.

893
01:04:45,248 --> 01:04:47,443
I'm talking about, like, a real date.

894
01:04:47,516 --> 01:04:51,008
You know, with, like, a nice restaurant,
some nice clothes.

895
01:04:51,087 --> 01:04:53,078
I'll get you some flowers.

896
01:04:53,155 --> 01:04:55,715
I thought we agreed
to keep this casual.

897
01:04:55,791 --> 01:04:57,986
Look, it's one steak. What is...

898
01:04:58,060 --> 01:05:03,259
One steak is not gonna forge some
kind of a lasting emotional bond.

899
01:05:04,567 --> 01:05:06,034
I'm serious.

900
01:05:06,402 --> 01:05:07,494
Yeah?

901
01:05:07,570 --> 01:05:09,538
- Yeah.
- So am I.

902
01:05:09,605 --> 01:05:12,073
It's one dinner. What's it gonna hurt?

903
01:05:12,141 --> 01:05:15,269
Well, if you ordered a steak,
I'd imagine a cow would be involved.

904
01:05:15,344 --> 01:05:18,472
What do you have, an art gallery
over here? What is this "2"?

905
01:05:19,782 --> 01:05:23,445
It's so the guy behind me knows
what place he's coming in.

906
01:05:24,887 --> 01:05:26,013
What about this one?

907
01:05:26,088 --> 01:05:33,017
That is the initials of the guys
on my high school relay team.

908
01:05:33,896 --> 01:05:36,296
A drunken celebration gone wrong?

909
01:05:37,466 --> 01:05:39,263
Something like that.

910
01:05:39,869 --> 01:05:43,100
- So, about this date.
- God. It's just dinner, right?

911
01:05:43,172 --> 01:05:48,166
No flowers, where we will discuss
nothing emotional or important?

912
01:05:49,578 --> 01:05:51,603
I am fully prepared

913
01:05:52,081 --> 01:05:56,677
to do an entire hour
on nothing but the Chicago Bears.

914
01:05:57,153 --> 01:05:59,314
And we can have
completely meaningless sex

915
01:05:59,388 --> 01:06:01,288
immediately afterwards.

916
01:06:01,357 --> 01:06:04,758
You think I'm gonna sleep with you
on our first date?

917
01:06:05,227 --> 01:06:06,694
Think again.

918
01:06:08,397 --> 01:06:10,126
You just head-butted me.

919
01:06:10,399 --> 01:06:12,765
I'm gonna teach you the breaststroke.

920
01:06:12,835 --> 01:06:17,534
It's pretty complicated,
different than that of the butterfly.

921
01:06:21,477 --> 01:06:24,878
I guess I can't sleep.

922
01:06:27,183 --> 01:06:29,174
Well, of course you can't.

923
01:06:30,486 --> 01:06:32,681
Your wife left you.
Your best friend died.

924
01:06:32,755 --> 01:06:34,746
You sound like a damn country song.

925
01:06:34,824 --> 01:06:37,520
If you had a dog,
he'd be run over by now.

926
01:06:37,593 --> 01:06:40,426
- So, did she send you papers?
- Yeah.

927
01:06:40,763 --> 01:06:42,253
And did you read them?

928
01:06:44,266 --> 01:06:45,255
No, I did not.

929
01:06:45,968 --> 01:06:48,493
Well, you think you might ought to?

930
01:06:55,111 --> 01:06:57,375
You know,
there never was anyone else, Mags.

931
01:06:57,446 --> 01:06:59,038
Like hell, Ben.

932
01:07:00,449 --> 01:07:02,144
You're a bigamist.

933
01:07:02,918 --> 01:07:05,318
You been married to the Coast Guard
all along.

934
01:07:05,388 --> 01:07:07,288
Give me that shoulder.

935
01:07:07,790 --> 01:07:12,352
You probably swum it out of socket
trying to prove you're still 19.

936
01:07:12,995 --> 01:07:14,462
Am I right?

937
01:07:18,300 --> 01:07:20,495
When the heck did we get old?

938
01:07:20,569 --> 01:07:22,833
Hell, I've always been old, Ben.

939
01:07:22,905 --> 01:07:24,736
You know what, though? I don't mind.

940
01:07:24,807 --> 01:07:27,469
I mean, if my muscles ache,
it's 'cause I've used them.

941
01:07:27,543 --> 01:07:29,704
If it's hard for me
to walk up them steps now,

942
01:07:29,779 --> 01:07:34,546
it's 'cause I walked up them every night
to lay next to a man who loved me.

943
01:07:34,617 --> 01:07:36,107
I got a few wrinkles here and there,

944
01:07:36,185 --> 01:07:40,884
but I've laid under thousands of skies
on sunny days, yeah.

945
01:07:42,058 --> 01:07:46,518
I look and feel this way,
well, 'cause I drank and I smoked,

946
01:07:46,595 --> 01:07:50,361
I lived and I loved,
and danced, sang, sweat

947
01:07:50,433 --> 01:07:53,925
and screwed my way
through a pretty damned good life,

948
01:07:54,070 --> 01:07:55,662
if you ask me.

949
01:07:55,771 --> 01:07:57,830
Getting old ain't bad, Ben.

950
01:07:57,907 --> 01:08:00,000
Getting old, that's earned.

951
01:08:33,876 --> 01:08:36,276
There will come a time
when you might have to decide

952
01:08:36,345 --> 01:08:38,210
who lives and dies out there.

953
01:08:39,748 --> 01:08:41,147
It's a terrible responsibility,

954
01:12:33,253 --> 01:12:36,552
When you're pulling through the water,
you're gonna pull yourself through.

955
01:12:37,257 --> 01:12:38,656
- Like, you know...
- So I'll go fast.

956
01:12:38,725 --> 01:12:41,159
No, you wanna lay to your side
and pull it like that.

957
01:12:46,166 --> 01:12:48,361
Hey, Charlie,
you get those fittings replaced

958
01:12:48,435 --> 01:12:50,835
- before you came off to get tanked up?
- Yes, sir, Captain.

959
01:12:50,904 --> 01:12:53,270
Yeah, I'll believe that when I see it.

960
01:12:53,340 --> 01:12:54,500
We go to "A" School,

961
01:12:54,575 --> 01:12:57,169
which is the most difficult school
in the military.

962
01:12:57,244 --> 01:13:00,042
The attrition rate's, like...
What is it, 50%?

963
01:13:00,113 --> 01:13:01,102
50%.

964
01:13:01,181 --> 01:13:02,910
- It's over 50%.
- Over 50.

965
01:13:02,983 --> 01:13:05,611
We're still here,
'cause we're the best of the best.

966
01:13:06,420 --> 01:13:10,379
When storms shut down entire ports,
you know who goes out?

967
01:13:10,924 --> 01:13:12,221
We do.

968
01:13:12,292 --> 01:13:14,886
When hurricanes...
When hurricanes ground the US Navy,

969
01:13:14,962 --> 01:13:18,591
like these little guys over here,
guess who goes out?

970
01:13:18,665 --> 01:13:20,189
That's right, we do.

971
01:13:20,267 --> 01:13:22,963
Look, honey,
you better keep it down in here, okay?

972
01:13:23,036 --> 01:13:24,970
Okay, honey. She called me "honey."

973
01:13:26,540 --> 01:13:27,734
Okay, honey.

974
01:13:27,808 --> 01:13:30,800
But when God himself reaches down
from heaven...

975
01:13:31,512 --> 01:13:34,379
- What does he do, Jake, when he...
- Rips houses off the foundation.

976
01:13:34,448 --> 01:13:37,815
When God himself rips houses
off the foundation, we go out,

977
01:13:37,885 --> 01:13:39,580
because we are rescue swimmers,

978
01:13:39,653 --> 01:13:42,247
and that is our job,
and that's what we do.

979
01:13:42,322 --> 01:13:44,449
You might wanna
recheck your compass.

980
01:13:44,525 --> 01:13:46,925
This ain't no puddle pirate bar.

981
01:13:55,602 --> 01:13:58,435
No problem,
because we were just leaving anyway.

982
01:13:58,505 --> 01:14:00,166
- Sit down, Hodge.
- Jake.

983
01:14:00,240 --> 01:14:01,935
- Finish your beer.
- Jake.

984
01:14:02,009 --> 01:14:03,636
Yeah, sit, Hodge.

985
01:14:04,311 --> 01:14:06,074
That's my beer, man.

986
01:14:11,084 --> 01:14:12,551
Finished now?

987
01:14:14,288 --> 01:14:16,153
Must be happy hour.

988
01:14:21,161 --> 01:14:22,150
Hey!

989
01:14:23,664 --> 01:14:24,688
Back off.

990
01:14:27,267 --> 01:14:29,758
Everyone in this place is retired Navy.

991
01:14:29,836 --> 01:14:32,566
Hey. Hey, when do I get
that phone call?

992
01:14:33,206 --> 01:14:36,664
I know I get a phone call.
When do I get my phone call?

993
01:14:41,949 --> 01:14:43,473
Ma'am, I am sorry,

994
01:14:43,550 --> 01:14:46,178
but if nobody come in 20 minutes,
I need the table.

995
01:14:46,553 --> 01:14:47,611
- Okay.
- I'm sorry.

996
01:14:47,688 --> 01:14:48,780
Yeah.

997
01:14:53,160 --> 01:14:55,094
She's never gonna talk to me again.

998
01:14:56,029 --> 01:14:58,429
You know they're gonna
kick us out for this, right?

999
01:14:58,498 --> 01:14:59,658
Yep.

1000
01:15:03,870 --> 01:15:06,100
Least they can't say we quit.

1001
01:15:07,174 --> 01:15:11,440
I was never gonna make it, anyway.
Skinner's right. Panic every time.

1002
01:15:12,813 --> 01:15:14,644
Man, screw Skinner.

1003
01:15:16,083 --> 01:15:17,914
I'm Skinner. Break my hold.

1004
01:15:17,985 --> 01:15:20,476
Hey, what are you doing, man?
Come on, Fischer, get off me.

1005
01:15:20,554 --> 01:15:21,816
Clock's ticking. Break it.

1006
01:15:21,888 --> 01:15:25,119
Fischer, you're hurting me, man.
Fischer, get off me, man!

1007
01:15:26,126 --> 01:15:28,788
Come on, Fischer, you're hurting me.
Fischer, man, get off!

1008
01:15:28,862 --> 01:15:30,887
- Break the goddamn hold.
- Fischer, get off me, man!

1009
01:15:30,964 --> 01:15:33,558
- Break the goddamn hold, Hodge.
- Fischer, get off me!

1010
01:15:35,068 --> 01:15:36,729
I said, get off me!

1011
01:15:37,204 --> 01:15:38,398
All right.

1012
01:15:38,672 --> 01:15:41,869
Now, it's just like that
when you're in the water.

1013
01:15:44,845 --> 01:15:47,905
Well, now. We could come back.

1014
01:15:48,382 --> 01:15:51,749
Give you boys time for a smoke
and some pillow talk.

1015
01:15:59,793 --> 01:16:01,055
You can't kick us out.

1016
01:16:01,128 --> 01:16:03,255
It's called disorderly
conduct, and yes, we can.

1017
01:16:03,330 --> 01:16:05,958
- We didn't fail at nothing.
- Our profession is all about control.

1018
01:16:06,033 --> 01:16:07,762
You both failed miserably
in that department.

1019
01:16:07,834 --> 01:16:09,631
Hold it right there.

1020
01:16:09,703 --> 01:16:11,500
- Senior?
- Yeah, come in.

1021
01:16:14,274 --> 01:16:16,401
Their disenrollment records.

1022
01:16:18,211 --> 01:16:19,542
Bar fight?

1023
01:16:21,048 --> 01:16:23,175
- All right, bring them in.
- Senior.

1024
01:16:23,283 --> 01:16:24,614
Square it.

1025
01:16:31,425 --> 01:16:34,622
It's all my fault, Senior Chief.
Hodge had nothing to do with it.

1026
01:16:36,396 --> 01:16:38,591
- That true, Hodge?
- It's true.

1027
01:16:42,502 --> 01:16:45,198
All right. Fine, you're dismissed.

1028
01:16:45,672 --> 01:16:49,631
- Senior Chief, I was...
- I said that you are dismissed.

1029
01:16:50,510 --> 01:16:51,772
Let's go.

1030
01:16:58,885 --> 01:17:01,615
You're gonna kick me out
for defending the Coast Guard?

1031
01:17:02,089 --> 01:17:04,182
The Coast Guard's been around
for 200 years.

1032
01:17:04,257 --> 01:17:07,590
I doubt a couple of knuckleheads
like yourself are gonna defend it.

1033
01:17:07,961 --> 01:17:09,189
Sit down.

1034
01:17:12,699 --> 01:17:16,294
I've been trying to peel the layers
back on you for a while now, and I...

1035
01:17:16,603 --> 01:17:17,831
I just don't get it.

1036
01:17:19,339 --> 01:17:21,432
I mean, this kind of work
seems a little remedial

1037
01:17:21,508 --> 01:17:22,532
for someone like yourself.

1038
01:17:22,609 --> 01:17:25,009
You know, big swim champ,
offer to every lvy League.

1039
01:17:25,078 --> 01:17:27,740
You give it all up to be here with us.

1040
01:17:29,015 --> 01:17:32,507
- Why?
- I'm here to save lives, Senior Chief.

1041
01:17:36,823 --> 01:17:39,053
I spoke with your coach, Jake.

1042
01:17:41,261 --> 01:17:43,729
- You spoke with my coach?
- Yeah, I spoke with your coach.

1043
01:17:43,797 --> 01:17:47,164
Something in your file
just kept hanging me up.

1044
01:17:47,234 --> 01:17:50,692
You win the state championship
your freshman and sophomore year

1045
01:17:50,771 --> 01:17:53,433
and then you don't swim the next two.

1046
01:17:53,707 --> 01:17:57,143
I'm just a public school guy,
so pardon me,

1047
01:17:57,210 --> 01:18:00,976
but it didn't add up until now.

1048
01:18:07,187 --> 01:18:10,384
"Kirk Holloway,
100-meter medley winner,

1049
01:18:11,224 --> 01:18:13,692
"thrown through the passenger window.

1050
01:18:13,760 --> 01:18:16,058
"Pronounced dead at the scene.

1051
01:18:17,564 --> 01:18:22,524
"Abe lkeman, first team All-American,
lungs crushed.

1052
01:18:25,572 --> 01:18:29,531
"Carl Sandoval,
50-meter freestyle champ,

1053
01:18:29,609 --> 01:18:34,239
"made it all the way to the hospital.
Died of internal bleeding."

1054
01:18:43,790 --> 01:18:46,520
I guess you just know everything, then.

1055
01:18:47,360 --> 01:18:49,954
I know what it's like to lose a team.

1056
01:18:51,398 --> 01:18:52,524
Yeah?

1057
01:18:52,799 --> 01:18:54,198
What about living in a small town

1058
01:18:54,267 --> 01:18:56,394
where everyone thinks
that you killed their brother

1059
01:18:56,469 --> 01:18:58,027
or their son or their best friend?

1060
01:18:58,104 --> 01:18:59,503
You know about that?

1061
01:19:00,440 --> 01:19:03,876
Kind of small town where everyone
still waves to everyone,

1062
01:19:05,111 --> 01:19:06,703
just not to you?

1063
01:19:09,115 --> 01:19:13,017
I read the report, Jake.
Your blood alcohol was zip that night.

1064
01:19:14,054 --> 01:19:17,182
I'm guessing there was a flip
for designated driver.

1065
01:19:17,257 --> 01:19:18,554
You lost.

1066
01:19:19,593 --> 01:19:21,686
Guess that just makes it
all go away, huh?

1067
01:19:21,761 --> 01:19:24,992
No, it doesn't make it all right.
It just makes it an accident.

1068
01:19:25,498 --> 01:19:27,523
At least that's how it reads.

1069
01:19:28,869 --> 01:19:30,530
You were 16 years old, Jake.

1070
01:19:30,604 --> 01:19:33,129
I'm not your priest, but if I was, I think...

1071
01:19:33,607 --> 01:19:35,700
I think maybe you'd deserve a pass.

1072
01:19:39,246 --> 01:19:41,271
You're giving me a pass?

1073
01:19:41,448 --> 01:19:45,578
You just think you know everything
with your psychobabble bullshit.

1074
01:19:45,652 --> 01:19:47,677
Why am I here? Why are you here?

1075
01:19:49,089 --> 01:19:51,785
You're too old to be doing this.
You're washed-up here.

1076
01:19:51,858 --> 01:19:55,419
You don't wanna be teaching
a bunch of kids in a pool. Am I right?

1077
01:19:55,495 --> 01:19:58,896
I don't give a shit what you read
or who you talked to.

1078
01:19:58,965 --> 01:20:02,901
You don't know about me! You don't...
I have me under control.

1079
01:20:07,440 --> 01:20:08,964
I can see that.

1080
01:20:28,094 --> 01:20:30,858
The only difference
between you and me is,

1081
01:20:32,399 --> 01:20:35,562
I don't wear the ones I lost
on my arm, Jake.

1082
01:20:44,010 --> 01:20:46,240
I know where you're at, Jake.

1083
01:20:47,147 --> 01:20:48,842
I'm there myself.

1084
01:20:51,084 --> 01:20:54,611
I ask myself every day
why I was the one that survived.

1085
01:20:59,926 --> 01:21:02,156
- And?
- And...

1086
01:21:04,965 --> 01:21:06,489
And if I can't answer that for me,

1087
01:21:06,566 --> 01:21:09,967
I'm certainly not going to try
and answer it for you.

1088
01:21:14,774 --> 01:21:16,173
Have a seat.

1089
01:21:22,615 --> 01:21:25,743
I want you
to start being a member of this team,

1090
01:21:26,953 --> 01:21:28,818
the team you have now.

1091
01:21:30,090 --> 01:21:31,990
You have a gift, Jake.

1092
01:21:32,359 --> 01:21:34,418
You're the best swimmer
to come through this program,

1093
01:21:34,494 --> 01:21:35,688
hands down, by far.

1094
01:21:35,762 --> 01:21:37,696
You got a whole record board
to prove it.

1095
01:21:37,764 --> 01:21:40,460
But you know what I see
when I look at it?

1096
01:21:40,533 --> 01:21:43,991
I see someone fast enough
who's gonna get there first.

1097
01:21:45,205 --> 01:21:47,332
I see someone strong enough
who's gonna last.

1098
01:21:47,407 --> 01:21:52,106
I see someone who can save a life
that maybe nobody else could.

1099
01:21:54,447 --> 01:21:57,575
You really wanna honor
the initials on your arm?

1100
01:21:58,885 --> 01:22:00,716
Then honor your gift.

1101
01:22:03,690 --> 01:22:05,817
Save the ones you can, Jake.

1102
01:22:07,260 --> 01:22:10,627
The rest, we've gotta let go.

1103
01:22:21,441 --> 01:22:23,568
Does this mean
you're not gonna fail me?

1104
01:22:24,377 --> 01:22:28,143
For what, backing up a buddy in a bar?

1105
01:22:31,051 --> 01:22:33,576
Man, I got bigger problems than you.

1106
01:22:36,823 --> 01:22:40,350
I don't know about you,
but I could use a fucking drink.

1107
01:22:45,198 --> 01:22:46,324
Oops.

1108
01:22:48,835 --> 01:22:52,703
I'm gonna consider everything tonight
off-record and off-duty.

1109
01:22:56,509 --> 01:22:57,669
That was an invite.

1110
01:22:58,478 --> 01:22:59,467
Oh.

1111
01:23:03,817 --> 01:23:05,785
You gotta be kidding me.

1112
01:23:06,386 --> 01:23:10,083
- What was it they called you?
- "Puddle pirates," but it's not...

1113
01:23:10,156 --> 01:23:13,887
I'm way over it, Senior Chief. This is...

1114
01:23:14,360 --> 01:23:17,727
- Well, it's like sticks and stones.
- Well, we'll just have one beer.

1115
01:23:24,104 --> 01:23:27,972
Great. They're angrier
and drunker. Perfect.

1116
01:23:28,041 --> 01:23:30,441
Hi. Two beers.

1117
01:23:31,444 --> 01:23:34,072
- You gotta be kidding me.
- That's what I said.

1118
01:23:34,981 --> 01:23:37,609
Look, I don't want any trouble, okay?

1119
01:23:40,587 --> 01:23:43,021
They really don't like us, do they?

1120
01:23:43,089 --> 01:23:47,526
No. They think they're better than us
because they're combat-oriented.

1121
01:23:48,695 --> 01:23:50,822
We're the Coast Guard, Jake.

1122
01:23:50,930 --> 01:23:54,093
Nobody really appreciates us
until they need us.

1123
01:23:56,636 --> 01:23:57,898
That him?

1124
01:24:05,845 --> 01:24:06,903
Yep.

1125
01:24:12,318 --> 01:24:15,651
So let me ask you a question
before we start bleeding.

1126
01:24:17,323 --> 01:24:21,350
All those saves...
What's your real number?

1127
01:24:28,301 --> 01:24:31,668
Do you have a death wish,
or are you just shit-stupid?

1128
01:24:33,006 --> 01:24:35,497
I'm gonna go with stupid this time.

1129
01:24:35,575 --> 01:24:37,440
- Hi.
- Hi.

1130
01:24:37,510 --> 01:24:39,569
Who's this, your old man?

1131
01:24:45,652 --> 01:24:48,086
You know,
I'm really glad you're still here.

1132
01:24:48,154 --> 01:24:49,815
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

1133
01:24:58,164 --> 01:25:00,894
- Behind you.
- Stand down! I said stand down.

1134
01:25:08,074 --> 01:25:10,065
I think you better leave.

1135
01:25:13,046 --> 01:25:14,138
Okay.

1136
01:25:16,616 --> 01:25:18,106
Come on, Jake.

1137
01:25:24,724 --> 01:25:27,124
All right, sit down. Have a beer.

1138
01:25:28,194 --> 01:25:30,822
- That went a lot better than I thought.
- Yeah.

1139
01:25:31,598 --> 01:25:34,624
- What the hell was that?
- I don't know.

1140
01:25:35,168 --> 01:25:38,968
Hey, I wanted to apologize to you

1141
01:25:40,306 --> 01:25:43,434
for what I said earlier about you
being old and washed-up now.

1142
01:25:46,045 --> 01:25:49,446
Is there anything
you'd like to say to me?

1143
01:25:49,816 --> 01:25:50,840
Like what?

1144
01:25:51,951 --> 01:25:53,919
I don't know, but I apologized to you.

1145
01:25:53,987 --> 01:25:55,750
I just thought that, you know,

1146
01:25:55,822 --> 01:25:58,052
there might be something
you've said or done

1147
01:25:58,124 --> 01:26:00,092
that you'd like to apologize to me for.

1148
01:26:00,159 --> 01:26:01,217
Why?

1149
01:26:02,929 --> 01:26:05,124
'Cause that's how it's done. I...

1150
01:26:05,498 --> 01:26:07,796
You suck at apologies, you know that?

1151
01:26:07,900 --> 01:26:09,891
I mean,
you're missing the whole concept.

1152
01:26:20,747 --> 01:26:23,944
<i>- Hello?
- Hi. It's me.</i>

1153
01:26:26,452 --> 01:26:30,013
Are you okay? What happened?
I mean, I waited for two hours.

1154
01:26:30,323 --> 01:26:34,453
Yeah. No. Look, I'm really sorry. I...

1155
01:26:35,028 --> 01:26:36,222
What happened?

1156
01:26:36,329 --> 01:26:39,093
<i>It's a really long story.</i>

1157
01:26:40,633 --> 01:26:44,194
Let me just... Let me put it this way.

1158
01:26:45,371 --> 01:26:50,035
It was the best worst night of my life.

1159
01:26:51,277 --> 01:26:53,074
Well, I'm glad someone had fun.

1160
01:26:58,418 --> 01:27:01,285
Can I see you tomorrow night?

1161
01:27:01,688 --> 01:27:03,952
I have parent-teacher conferences
tomorrow.

1162
01:27:04,957 --> 01:27:06,584
What about the next night?

1163
01:27:07,193 --> 01:27:09,354
I have parent-teacher conferences
all week.

1164
01:27:10,763 --> 01:27:13,755
<i>- You blowing me off?
- No, Jake.</i>

1165
01:27:14,967 --> 01:27:16,662
I wouldn't do that to somebody.

1166
01:27:18,771 --> 01:27:21,706
<i>I gotta get up in a couple hours.
I gotta go.</i>

1167
01:27:21,874 --> 01:27:24,843
<i>- Yep.
- Goodbye.</i>

1168
01:27:35,388 --> 01:27:37,652
All right, you know what
we briefed on the ground.

1169
01:27:37,724 --> 01:27:40,352
Same thing.
We're gonna stay together.

1170
01:27:40,426 --> 01:27:44,294
No matter what happens out there,
you stay together.

1171
01:27:44,731 --> 01:27:49,395
Whatever decision you make,
you make as a team.

1172
01:27:52,472 --> 01:27:55,635
<i>We trained to freefall at 15 to 20 feet.</i>

1173
01:27:56,275 --> 01:27:59,608
<i>You fall from 50 feet,
it's like hitting concrete.</i>

1174
01:28:00,012 --> 01:28:03,812
<i>You fall 80 to 100 feet, you die.</i>

1175
01:28:10,923 --> 01:28:12,322
Hey, where they going?

1176
01:28:12,392 --> 01:28:14,087
They're supposed to come back
for us, right?

1177
01:28:14,160 --> 01:28:16,185
I don't know.
Well, Hodge, you been here before.

1178
01:28:16,262 --> 01:28:17,422
They're gonna come back for us, right?

1179
01:28:17,497 --> 01:28:19,761
Yeah, but I never made it this far.

1180
01:28:19,832 --> 01:28:22,426
- You're kidding.
- Not to the final week.

1181
01:28:23,302 --> 01:28:25,270
They're not coming back.

1182
01:28:25,872 --> 01:28:29,137
- What do we do?
- All right, listen up.

1183
01:28:29,809 --> 01:28:31,743
We stay together as a group.

1184
01:28:31,811 --> 01:28:34,302
Nobody falls behind.
We all stay together.

1185
01:28:34,380 --> 01:28:37,247
One guy goes back,
we get him back up to the front, okay?

1186
01:28:37,316 --> 01:28:39,079
We're a team. Oorah.

1187
01:28:39,152 --> 01:28:40,847
- Oorah.
- Oorah!

1188
01:28:40,920 --> 01:28:42,683
Let's do it, 5506.

1189
01:29:19,425 --> 01:29:22,053
Sir, it's okay,
I'm with the US Coast Guard.

1190
01:29:48,788 --> 01:29:50,016
Again.

1191
01:29:57,730 --> 01:30:01,063
I'm a Coast Guard rescue swimmer.
I'm here to help you.

1192
01:30:02,368 --> 01:30:03,665
Time-out.

1193
01:30:03,736 --> 01:30:05,067
Class, pop tall.

1194
01:30:05,137 --> 01:30:08,072
Hodge, get yourself
to the side of the pool.

1195
01:30:08,140 --> 01:30:09,539
Aye, aye, Senior Chief.

1196
01:30:13,045 --> 01:30:14,410
Oorah!

1197
01:30:23,890 --> 01:30:25,152
Easy, Chief.

1198
01:30:26,859 --> 01:30:28,622
Guess it was a lucky punch.

1199
01:30:32,365 --> 01:30:33,525
Hodge!

1200
01:30:36,369 --> 01:30:38,803
- You all right, Chief?
- You stay right there!

1201
01:30:48,748 --> 01:30:50,477
Well done, Charlie.

1202
01:30:53,519 --> 01:30:54,884
Well done.

1203
01:30:56,722 --> 01:30:58,587
Oorah, Chief Skinner.

1204
01:30:59,292 --> 01:31:02,420
Class 5506, "Oorah, Hodge," on three!

1205
01:31:02,495 --> 01:31:04,395
One, two, three.

1206
01:31:04,463 --> 01:31:06,124
Oorah, Hodge!

1207
01:31:07,900 --> 01:31:09,367
Good for you.

1208
01:31:16,275 --> 01:31:17,333
Get their gear off.

1209
01:31:17,410 --> 01:31:19,810
- Go on, get that gear off.
- Get that gear off!

1210
01:31:33,259 --> 01:31:34,624
Get it off!

1211
01:31:38,230 --> 01:31:42,257
Class 5506,
will you come find me if I am lost?

1212
01:31:42,935 --> 01:31:44,527
Yes, Senior Chief!

1213
01:31:45,905 --> 01:31:48,533
Will you come save me
if I am drowning?

1214
01:31:48,608 --> 01:31:50,235
Yes, Senior Chief!

1215
01:31:55,314 --> 01:31:57,077
I believe you would.

1216
01:31:58,084 --> 01:32:00,609
I have high hopes for this class.

1217
01:32:07,360 --> 01:32:09,385
I have high hopes for you.

Where's Senior Chief?

1224
01:32:30,416 --> 01:32:32,816
He had a chance to go back to Kodiak
and he took it.

1225
01:32:32,885 --> 01:32:34,409
He never had
much of a bedside manner.

1226
01:32:34,487 --> 01:32:35,977
He's a water dog, Jake,

1227
01:32:36,055 --> 01:32:39,081
and as it turns out,
not a half-bad teacher.

01:33:44,757 --> 01:33:46,054
Just casual.

1241
01:33:47,893 --> 01:33:49,053
Right.

1242
01:33:52,465 --> 01:33:55,093
To getting what you've always wanted.

1243
01:33:57,036 --> 01:33:59,027
And always wanting more.

1244
01:34:01,841 --> 01:34:03,968
Take care of yourself, Jake.

1245
01:34:18,858 --> 01:34:21,156
- I gotta go to work.
- Yeah.

1246
01:34:36,809 --> 01:34:37,867
Bye.

1247
01:35:52,418 --> 01:35:55,216
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to the Rock.

1248
01:35:55,955 --> 01:35:59,152
I'm Captain William Hadley,
CO of Kodiak Air Station.

1249
01:35:59,592 --> 01:36:01,617
- Fischer.
- Yeah, right here.

1250
01:36:01,694 --> 01:36:04,219
Mr. Mitcheltree will square you away.

1251
01:36:04,296 --> 01:36:06,457
The rest of you,
step up here with Mr. Christiansen.

1252
01:36:06,532 --> 01:36:08,500
He will process you in.

1253
01:36:23,349 --> 01:36:24,816
Oh, amazing.

1254
01:36:25,451 --> 01:36:27,248
Not only does he come back
in great shape,

1255
01:36:27,319 --> 01:36:29,048
but he still thinks he can cook.

1256
01:36:29,121 --> 01:36:31,282
- Hello, Jake. Welcome.
- How you doing?

1257
01:36:31,390 --> 01:36:33,984
- Good to see you again.
- You guys keep it warm here, huh?

1258
01:36:34,059 --> 01:36:36,220
Glad to know
you know where a free meal is.

1259
01:36:36,629 --> 01:36:38,392
We need three crews in Sitka
for the weekend.

1260
01:36:38,464 --> 01:36:39,829
You make sure that happens.

1261
01:36:39,899 --> 01:36:42,163
And the stand team arrives here
next Tuesday.

1262
01:36:42,835 --> 01:36:45,429
Patch things up with the wife?

1263
01:36:47,339 --> 01:36:50,035
You fix things up with that young lady?

1264
01:36:51,277 --> 01:36:54,041
Well, you still have a choice, you know.

1265
01:36:56,415 --> 01:37:00,579
Hey, there's a question
I wanted to ask you back in school

1266
01:37:01,353 --> 01:37:02,445
and I didn't.

1267
01:37:03,455 --> 01:37:06,583
But when you can't save them all,

1268
01:37:08,594 --> 01:37:10,721
how do you choose who lives?

1269
01:37:12,197 --> 01:37:15,132
It's probably different
for everybody, Jake.

1270
01:37:16,235 --> 01:37:18,999
Kind of simple for me, though. I just...

1271
01:37:19,338 --> 01:37:23,434
I take the first one I come to
or the weakest one in the group,

1272
01:37:23,509 --> 01:37:27,172
and then I swim
as fast and as hard as I can

1273
01:37:28,213 --> 01:37:29,771
for as long as I can.

1274
01:37:31,917 --> 01:37:34,044
And the sea takes the rest.

1275
01:37:39,124 --> 01:37:40,716
Think I'm ready?

1276
01:37:42,561 --> 01:37:46,827
I'm not your teacher anymore, Jake.
I'm just your fellow swimmer.

1277
01:37:46,899 --> 01:37:49,959
That's not exactly
the answer I'm looking for there.

1278
01:37:50,035 --> 01:37:53,994
If I did not think you were ready,
I would not put you in the Bering Sea.

1279
01:37:59,878 --> 01:38:02,142
<i>6030, this is Kodiak Ops Cent.</i>

1280
01:38:02,214 --> 01:38:04,341
<i>We are diverting your training mission
at this time.</i>

1281
01:38:04,416 --> 01:38:06,384
<i>We have two young kayakers
swept into the cave</i>

1282
01:38:06,452 --> 01:38:07,885
<i>one mile south of Saltery Cove.</i>

1283
01:38:07,953 --> 01:38:10,080
<i>- How copy?
- 6030 copies.</i>

1284
01:38:10,155 --> 01:38:12,521
<i>- We're diverting at this time.
- We've got a real case now.</i>

1285
01:38:12,591 --> 01:38:14,320
<i>Okay, guys, that tide's coming in,</i>

1286
01:38:14,393 --> 01:38:16,953
<i>and we've got six- to eight-foot rollers
coming from the north.</i>

1287
01:38:17,029 --> 01:38:19,657
<i>Senior, what do you think
about taking Fischer with you on this?</i>

1288
01:38:19,732 --> 01:38:22,462
<i>I want him with me.
All right? He's good to go.</i>

1289
01:38:23,002 --> 01:38:25,527
<i>I don't think it's gonna be
a problem sliding in there.</i>

1290
01:38:25,604 --> 01:38:28,368
<i>I think the problem's gonna be
coming back out.</i>

1291
01:38:28,440 --> 01:38:31,466
<i>That's why I got Jake with me.
Got my human speedboat.</i>

1292
01:38:34,013 --> 01:38:38,450
<i>Kodiak Ops, this is 6030.
We're on-scene at this time.</i>

1293
01:38:40,319 --> 01:38:43,345
<i>No sign of kayakers.
I'm taking her down.</i>

1294
01:38:48,260 --> 01:38:50,160
<i>Cabin door is open and locked.</i>

1295
01:38:50,529 --> 01:38:52,190
<i>Those are definitely
ten-foot waves.</i>

1296
01:38:53,966 --> 01:38:56,161
<i>Swimmer's coming to the door.</i>

1297
01:38:58,470 --> 01:38:59,994
Remember, all right?

1298
01:39:00,072 --> 01:39:04,441
You got the whole weight of the ocean
punching through that opening.

1299
01:39:04,510 --> 01:39:07,911
You gotta read the hydraulics,
gotta count the waves,

1300
01:39:08,313 --> 01:39:10,281
then wait for the flush.

1301
01:39:11,717 --> 01:39:13,344
<i>Checking swimmer.</i>

1302
01:39:14,086 --> 01:39:17,578
<i>Sure as hell hope
you paid attention in class, Speedboat.</i>

1303
01:39:39,645 --> 01:39:41,510
<i>Swimmers in the water.</i>

1304
01:39:41,747 --> 01:39:43,271
<i>Swimmers okay.</i>

1305
01:39:47,986 --> 01:39:51,080
<i>Swimmer Two is making contact
with Swimmer One.</i>

1306
01:40:27,025 --> 01:40:28,049
Hey!

1307
01:40:28,360 --> 01:40:29,384
Over here!

1308
01:40:29,461 --> 01:40:31,258
- Here.
- Over here!

1309
01:40:31,330 --> 01:40:32,854
Got them. Three o'clock.

1310
01:40:33,365 --> 01:40:34,730
Right here.

1311
01:40:38,637 --> 01:40:40,969
We're rescue swimmers.
We're gonna get you out of here.

1312
01:40:41,039 --> 01:40:43,064
Can't believe
you guys actually got here.

1313
01:40:43,142 --> 01:40:44,700
Give me your hand.

1314
01:40:46,712 --> 01:40:47,906
Just the two of you?

1315
01:40:47,980 --> 01:40:49,572
Yeah, yeah. His arm's hurt real bad.

1316
01:40:49,648 --> 01:40:50,979
All right.

1317
01:40:51,717 --> 01:40:56,780
Swimmer One. I got two survivors.
It's gonna be a basket pickup here.

1318
01:40:56,855 --> 01:40:57,879
Roger.

1319
01:40:57,956 --> 01:40:59,048
Broken here?

1320
01:40:59,124 --> 01:41:01,922
You take him first.
Get him in the basket.

1321
01:41:02,794 --> 01:41:04,921
I'll follow with the other one
right behind you.

1322
01:41:04,997 --> 01:41:06,055
- You got that?
- Yeah.

1323
01:41:06,131 --> 01:41:07,120
- You got it?
- Yeah, yeah.

1324
01:41:07,199 --> 01:41:09,224
All right. I'm gonna lower you down
in here, all right?

1325
01:41:09,301 --> 01:41:11,496
- Okay.
- Relax, buddy. I got you.

1326
01:41:13,038 --> 01:41:14,369
All right.

1327
01:41:14,806 --> 01:41:16,637
- You're with me.
- Okay.

1328
01:41:25,517 --> 01:41:27,314
I don't swim so good.

1329
01:41:27,452 --> 01:41:30,250
- You don't swim so good?
- No, sir.

1330
01:41:30,322 --> 01:41:34,281
It's okay. I swim pretty good.
All right, on your back.

1331
01:41:50,075 --> 01:41:53,909
- Wait. Are we gonna take the boat?
- I'm the boat.

1332
01:41:53,979 --> 01:41:55,446
Wait. Wait, wait, wait.

1333
01:41:55,514 --> 01:41:58,074
- I'm not ready! I can't...
- Hey!

1334
01:41:58,150 --> 01:42:00,880
- Wait, wait, wait...
- Settle down!

1335
01:42:20,272 --> 01:42:21,569
<i>Something's not right.</i>

1336
01:42:21,640 --> 01:42:23,733
<i>Swimmer One's going back
to the cave.</i>

1337
01:42:54,873 --> 01:42:56,363
What happened?

1338
01:42:57,142 --> 01:42:58,609
He hit a log.

1339
01:42:59,611 --> 01:43:01,408
What? What are you...

1340
01:43:02,547 --> 01:43:04,378
What...

1341
01:43:16,328 --> 01:43:18,421
- He's gone, Jake.
- He's not.

1342
01:43:20,866 --> 01:43:23,198
He's just got a head laceration.

1343
01:43:27,973 --> 01:43:30,498
Here we go. Come on.

1344
01:43:32,744 --> 01:43:33,972
Let's go.

1345
01:43:36,081 --> 01:43:37,343
Let's go!

1346
01:43:40,886 --> 01:43:44,947
Senior Chief Randall! Lock it in.

1347
01:43:48,160 --> 01:43:49,218
It's simple physics.

1348
01:43:49,294 --> 01:43:52,127
We're just gonna time the flush,
all right?

1349
01:43:55,867 --> 01:43:57,164
All right.

1350
01:43:57,836 --> 01:43:59,633
You call it, Swimmer.

1351
01:44:06,945 --> 01:44:07,934
Now!

1352
01:44:18,490 --> 01:44:22,426
Hey, I know you're tired, okay?
I know you feel tired right now.

1353
01:44:22,494 --> 01:44:25,019
But you need
to keep your eyes open, okay?

1354
01:44:25,130 --> 01:44:28,429
All right? All right?
Hey, I need you to keep talking to him.

1355
01:44:28,500 --> 01:44:30,195
- You keep talking to him.
- Okay.

1356
01:44:30,268 --> 01:44:32,065
Senior. Senior!

1357
01:44:33,138 --> 01:44:35,402
Can you open these up for me?

1358
01:44:35,807 --> 01:44:38,537
One by one,
I want you to hand them to me.

1359
01:44:38,777 --> 01:44:39,903
Reyes!

1360
01:44:39,978 --> 01:44:41,309
He's fine.

1361
01:44:43,181 --> 01:44:44,910
Right here, buddy. Right here. Okay?

1362
01:44:44,983 --> 01:44:46,007
- Okay.
- Right here.

1363
01:44:52,824 --> 01:44:54,553
- Robert!
- I'm okay.

1364
01:44:54,626 --> 01:44:56,719
He's got a compound fracture
in his right radius.

1365
01:44:56,795 --> 01:44:58,888
We tried to stabilize that a little bit.

1366
01:44:58,964 --> 01:45:00,124
We put a collar on this one,

1367
01:45:00,198 --> 01:45:01,825
but it's more precautionary
than anything.

1368
01:45:01,900 --> 01:45:02,958
Thank you.

1369
01:45:03,034 --> 01:45:05,059
This one's possibly
a little bit concussive.

1370
01:45:05,137 --> 01:45:07,071
We checked their vitals
the whole way back.

1371
01:45:07,139 --> 01:45:10,302
They're both mildly hypothermic,
but I think they'll come around.

1372
01:45:12,511 --> 01:45:14,138
Thank you so much.

1373
01:45:17,315 --> 01:45:18,907
You're welcome.

1374
01:45:22,821 --> 01:45:24,448
It happens, Ben.

1375
01:45:25,757 --> 01:45:28,590
Not to me. Not like that.

1376
01:45:30,996 --> 01:45:34,898
I want you to sign them in front of me.

1377
01:45:35,600 --> 01:45:37,500
Why don't you take some time
and think about it?

1378
01:45:37,569 --> 01:45:38,934
No. It's...

1379
01:45:40,238 --> 01:45:44,072
It's over. Just sign them.

1380
01:45:50,081 --> 01:45:51,275
Please.

1381
01:46:15,540 --> 01:46:17,667
Could've happened to anyone.

1382
01:46:18,310 --> 01:46:19,470
Maybe.

1383
01:46:19,945 --> 01:46:23,108
But what if it happens again?
What then?

1384
01:46:24,115 --> 01:46:26,777
Kid got a couple stitches.
He's gonna be fine.

1385
01:46:26,852 --> 01:46:28,683
We got him out of there.

1386
01:46:29,120 --> 01:46:30,519
No, you did.

1387
01:46:31,156 --> 01:46:33,454
You were strong out there today.

1388
01:46:34,860 --> 01:46:36,623
I was proud of you.

1389
01:46:39,698 --> 01:46:41,495
What are you gonna do?

1390
01:46:42,200 --> 01:46:44,828
Friend of mine once suggested fishing.

1391
01:46:46,538 --> 01:46:48,768
Think I might take his advice.

1392
01:46:49,307 --> 01:46:50,535
Fishing?

1393
01:46:50,942 --> 01:46:52,034
Yeah.

1394
01:46:52,377 --> 01:46:54,845
Guys like us don't go fishing.

1395
01:46:56,081 --> 01:46:58,379
Where have I heard that before?

1396
01:47:05,857 --> 01:47:09,122
Senior, before you go,

1397
01:47:10,228 --> 01:47:12,128
I gotta know one thing.

1398
01:47:12,764 --> 01:47:14,732
What's your real number?

1399
01:47:19,938 --> 01:47:21,303
Twenty-two.

1400
01:47:24,209 --> 01:47:25,540
Twenty-two?

1401
01:47:27,712 --> 01:47:31,808
That's not bad. It's not 200. It's not...

1402
01:47:31,883 --> 01:47:34,943
Twenty-two's the number of people
I lost, Jake.

1403
01:47:36,121 --> 01:47:38,248
Only number I kept track of.

1404
01:47:56,575 --> 01:47:58,873
Keeps the sea out of your mouth.

1405
01:48:37,916 --> 01:48:38,940
Hey.

1406
01:48:39,751 --> 01:48:40,740
Hi.

1407
01:48:43,355 --> 01:48:45,448
You started painting again?

1408
01:48:46,424 --> 01:48:48,517
Yeah. Great light up there.

1409
01:48:56,768 --> 01:48:58,030
You know,

1410
01:48:59,704 --> 01:49:02,730
I wanna apologize
for the phone calls, Helen.

1411
01:49:04,275 --> 01:49:06,675
I should've given you your space.

1412
01:49:08,046 --> 01:49:09,877
And you felt
showing up here unannounced

1413
01:49:09,948 --> 01:49:12,542
was the best way to communicate that?

1414
01:49:18,723 --> 01:49:19,747
Hey.

1415
01:49:44,949 --> 01:49:46,348
- Please just...
- Ben.

1416
01:49:46,418 --> 01:49:50,479
I want you to have it, along with these.

1417
01:49:52,891 --> 01:49:54,381
I signed them.

1418
01:50:00,498 --> 01:50:01,726
Why now?

1419
01:50:09,708 --> 01:50:12,609
I had a... I had a case a while back.

1420
01:50:12,677 --> 01:50:15,043
You know, a couple was drowning.

1421
01:50:17,716 --> 01:50:18,944
By the time I got there,

1422
01:50:19,017 --> 01:50:22,282
the husband
was dragging his wife under,

1423
01:50:23,188 --> 01:50:25,418
just trying to stay afloat.

1424
01:50:26,925 --> 01:50:29,223
Pure survival instinct.

1425
01:50:32,097 --> 01:50:33,564
It took me...

1426
01:50:35,433 --> 01:50:40,837
Took me a long time to understand
that that man was me.

1427
01:50:45,410 --> 01:50:48,345
Oh, man. Oh, doggone it.

1428
01:50:53,451 --> 01:50:54,611
Sorry.

1429
01:50:56,654 --> 01:50:58,815
Aren't you gonna answer that?

1430
01:51:02,360 --> 01:51:05,056
I'm not a rescue swimmer anymore,
Helen.

1431
01:51:31,890 --> 01:51:33,187
Bye, baby.

1432
01:52:00,652 --> 01:52:01,676
Lock it up.

1433
01:52:01,753 --> 01:52:04,620
We have a 75-foot fishing vessel
in distress,

1434
01:52:04,689 --> 01:52:06,657
taking on water in high seas.

1435
01:52:07,759 --> 01:52:10,922
<i>She's dead in the water
with four souls onboard.</i>

1436
01:52:11,329 --> 01:52:14,230
<i>With its dewatering pumps
unable to keep up,</i>

1437
01:52:14,532 --> 01:52:18,161
<i>it's not a matter of
if this thing is going down, but when.</i>

1438
01:52:40,725 --> 01:52:43,956
Tighten her down!
We gotta secure her.

1439
01:52:56,841 --> 01:53:00,971
<i>There will come a time
when you're going to have to say no.</i>

1440
01:53:02,547 --> 01:53:08,747
<i>You'll be facing crews from five to 20,
all saying, "Save me, save me."</i>

1441
01:53:09,320 --> 01:53:11,515
<i>They're looking for a miracle.</i>

1442
01:53:12,757 --> 01:53:14,247
<i>At 24 years old,</i>

1443
01:53:14,325 --> 01:53:17,453
<i>you have to find a way
to be that miracle.</i>

1444
01:53:17,662 --> 01:53:20,096
<i>Sounds good. We'll plan
our free-fall deployment to the water.</i>

1445
01:53:20,164 --> 01:53:21,893
<i>- Are you good with that, Jake?
- Yeah, copy that.</i>

1446
01:53:21,966 --> 01:53:25,197
<i>Okay, if we have to put you in,
we're gonna get you in upswell</i>

1447
01:53:25,270 --> 01:53:27,238
<i>and let the waves
take you down to the boat.</i>

1448
01:53:27,305 --> 01:53:29,170
<i>- Are you good with that?
- Roger.</i>

1449
01:53:29,240 --> 01:53:31,606
<i>We're only gonna have
about 20 minutes on-scene,</i>

1450
01:53:31,676 --> 01:53:34,008
<i>- so we gotta be quick.
- Copy that.</i>

1451
01:53:34,112 --> 01:53:37,809
<i>All right, I got the vessel in sight.
Two o'clock, about 50 meters.</i>

1452
01:53:45,056 --> 01:53:47,024
<i>Cabin door open and locked.</i>

1453
01:53:47,091 --> 01:53:49,559
<i>Pre-rescue checklist
for free-fall deployment.</i>

1454
01:53:51,062 --> 01:53:52,461
<i>Whoa, whoa!
Boat just took a wave, sir.</i>

1455
01:53:52,530 --> 01:53:53,929
<i>One appears to have gone
on the edge.</i>

1456
01:53:53,998 --> 01:53:55,192
<i>He's hanging from the cargo net.</i>

1457
01:53:56,467 --> 01:53:57,991
<i>We need to get our swimmer
down there.</i>

1458
01:53:58,069 --> 01:53:59,593
<i>Computer's showing 60 knots...</i>

1459
01:53:59,671 --> 01:54:01,161
<i>Going off com.</i>

1460
01:54:01,506 --> 01:54:04,373
<i>Prepare for a free-fall deployment
of the rescue swimmer.</i>

1461
01:54:07,845 --> 01:54:09,506
<i>Rescue checklist, part two.</i>

1462
01:54:09,580 --> 01:54:11,047
<i>Swimmer's getting ready.</i>

1463
01:54:11,115 --> 01:54:13,174
<i>Rescue checklist complete.
Swimmer's coming out.</i>

1464
01:54:13,251 --> 01:54:15,242
<i>Roger that. Check swimmer.</i>

1465
01:54:15,486 --> 01:54:18,387
<i>Swimmer's at the door, sir.
Checking swimmer.</i>

1466
01:54:18,456 --> 01:54:19,946
<i>Swimmer ready?</i>

1467
01:54:20,625 --> 01:54:22,820
<i>God help you if you ain't, boy.</i>

1468
01:54:26,698 --> 01:54:28,222
<i>Swimmer's away.</i>

1469
01:54:37,141 --> 01:54:40,235
<i>Swimmer's okay.
He's heading towards the vessel.</i>

1470
01:54:46,784 --> 01:54:50,276
<i>All right, he's cutting
through those waves pretty good.</i>

1471
01:55:10,108 --> 01:55:12,542
<i>That's it. He's approaching the vessel.</i>

1472
01:55:13,111 --> 01:55:15,011
<i>He's at the boat, sir.</i>

1473
01:55:20,818 --> 01:55:23,548
Man, are we glad to see you!

1474
01:55:35,466 --> 01:55:37,832
<i>Kodiak Ops, rescue 6034.</i>

1475
01:55:37,902 --> 01:55:40,132
<i>Fischer's onboard,
but vessel is compromised.</i>

1476
01:55:40,204 --> 01:55:42,468
<i>Taking on lots of water.
May not hold much longer.</i>

1477
01:55:42,540 --> 01:55:43,598
<i>Stand by for further.</i>

1478
01:55:44,075 --> 01:55:46,703
How many guys you got on here?
Is anybody injured?

1479
01:55:46,778 --> 01:55:47,904
I got four guys.

1480
01:55:47,979 --> 01:55:49,844
This guy's got a broken leg.

1481
01:55:49,914 --> 01:55:52,644
The skipper's down below.
He's trying to start the pumps.

1482
01:55:52,717 --> 01:55:55,550
- All right, he's gonna go up first.
- All right.

1483
01:55:55,853 --> 01:55:59,186
<i>Kodiak Ops, Kodiak Ops,
this is rescue 6034.</i>

1484
01:55:59,257 --> 01:56:01,589
<i>There's three onboard with injuries,
one more down below.</i>

1485
01:56:02,860 --> 01:56:04,919
<i>What do you want me to do?</i>

1486
01:56:14,572 --> 01:56:16,767
You there,
help me get him around in here.

1487
01:56:17,408 --> 01:56:19,535
- Bring him on in.
- All right.

1488
01:56:34,592 --> 01:56:36,583
Basket is on its way up.

1489
01:56:44,102 --> 01:56:45,569
Strap in. Strap in!

1490
01:56:45,636 --> 01:56:48,434
The captain's down below,
and there's one other man on deck.

1491
01:56:48,506 --> 01:56:50,940
Help him out. Strap yourself in.
Get out of the way.

1492
01:56:51,008 --> 01:56:54,603
<i>I repeat, the boat's going
down fast. Eight minutes to bingo.</i>

1493
01:56:58,850 --> 01:57:01,546
All right, come on, get in the basket.

1494
01:57:07,325 --> 01:57:09,793
<i>I have
the ready-for-pickup signal.</i>

1495
01:57:11,095 --> 01:57:12,392
Hold on.

1496
01:57:14,699 --> 01:57:17,099
<i>Swimmer One, Swimmer One,
come in.</i>

1497
01:57:18,436 --> 01:57:20,529
<i>Rescue swimmer, 6034.</i>

1498
01:57:20,605 --> 01:57:22,505
<i>Fischer. Come in, Fischer.</i>

1499
01:57:22,573 --> 01:57:24,803
<i>Swimmer One, Swimmer One,
come in.</i>

1500
01:57:24,876 --> 01:57:27,743
<i>- This is Swimmer One.
- Roger that, Swimmer One. Go ahead.</i>

1501
01:57:27,812 --> 01:57:30,872
<i>Swimmer One. I got one down
below. I'm gonna go down there.</i>

1502
01:57:30,948 --> 01:57:34,440
<i>Swimmer One, be advised
we've got seven minutes to bingo.</i>

1503
01:57:34,552 --> 01:57:36,076
I'm going down.

1504
01:57:48,065 --> 01:57:49,794
- Captain?
- Yeah!

1505
01:57:49,967 --> 01:57:51,059
Captain?

1506
01:57:55,072 --> 01:57:58,872
Captain! I'm a rescue swimmer.
I'm here to help you out.

1507
01:57:58,943 --> 01:58:02,470
Your leg is jammed in here?
Or is it just closed...

1508
01:58:02,547 --> 01:58:04,276
It's the whole leg!

1509
01:58:04,549 --> 01:58:07,484
I tried to free the clutch and got stuck.

1510
01:58:09,120 --> 01:58:10,610
This is Swimmer One.

1511
01:58:10,688 --> 01:58:13,179
I got the captain down here
in the engine room. He's stuck.

1512
01:58:13,257 --> 01:58:14,588
<i>We're gonna be a little bit.</i>

1513
01:58:14,659 --> 01:58:16,092
<i>Swimmer One, we're about out of time.</i>

1514
01:58:16,160 --> 01:58:18,754
<i>That boat's listing bad,
and we're two minutes to bingo.</i>

1515
01:58:18,829 --> 01:58:21,229
I ain't leaving here without him.

1516
01:58:22,500 --> 01:58:25,196
Send somebody back for us,
'cause I'm staying down here with him.

1517
01:58:25,269 --> 01:58:28,295
<i>Negative, Swimmer One.
We need you topside ASAP.</i>

1518
01:58:29,507 --> 01:58:31,873
<i>Swimmer One, 6034.</i>

1519
01:58:32,543 --> 01:58:34,943
<i>Swimmer One, 6034.</i>

1520
01:58:35,546 --> 01:58:38,777
<i>Kodiak Ops, Kodiak Ops,
this is 6034.</i>

1521
01:58:38,849 --> 01:58:41,181
<i>Be advised we are RTB at this time.</i>

1522
01:58:41,252 --> 01:58:43,277
<i>We are leaving the rescue swimmer
on-scene.</i>

1523
01:58:43,354 --> 01:58:45,515
<i>I say again, we are leaving
our rescue swimmer on-scene.</i>

1524
01:58:45,590 --> 01:58:47,023
Who do we have left in the shop?

1525
01:58:47,091 --> 01:58:49,184
08's all we've got left, sir, but no crew.

1526
01:58:49,260 --> 01:58:50,750
- All right, get her online.
- Yes, sir.

1527
01:58:50,828 --> 01:58:53,922
Lieutenant Krauss, suit up.
We're handling this.

1528
01:58:55,066 --> 01:58:56,693
I need a swimmer.

1529
01:58:59,036 --> 01:59:00,401
Don't worry.

1530
01:59:00,504 --> 01:59:02,233
No, no, they'll get him.

1531
01:59:02,306 --> 01:59:03,432
Don't worry! Don't worry.

1532
01:59:16,921 --> 01:59:18,320
Here we go.

1533
01:59:34,338 --> 01:59:35,999
Hold on. Hold on.

1534
01:59:42,246 --> 01:59:44,373
- Ready to go home?
- Yeah, man.

1535
02:00:00,298 --> 02:00:01,925
Captain. Captain!

1536
02:00:16,847 --> 02:00:19,611
- Are we cleared in, Lieutenant?
- Aye, aye, Captain.

1537
02:00:19,684 --> 02:00:21,083
Outstanding.

1538
02:00:37,868 --> 02:00:40,666
<i>Rescue Swimmer One, this is 6008.</i>

1539
02:00:40,738 --> 02:00:41,830
<i>Do you read?</i>

1540
02:00:41,906 --> 02:00:45,740
<i>Come in, Rescue Swimmer One.
6008. Do you read?</i>

1541
02:00:46,477 --> 02:00:48,445
<i>Come on, Jake, be there.</i>

1542
02:01:05,663 --> 02:01:09,099
<i>Cabin door's coming
open. Cabin door's open and locked.</i>

1543
02:01:09,867 --> 02:01:13,132
<i>All right, right there.
Right side. Nobody onboard.</i>

1544
02:01:14,105 --> 02:01:15,970
All right. I see what I want.

1545
02:01:16,040 --> 02:01:18,804
Just get me down.
The right-hand corner.

1546
02:01:18,876 --> 02:01:20,468
Try to avoid the rigging.

1547
02:01:20,544 --> 02:01:22,603
<i>Okay, swimmer requests
aft right-hand corner.</i>

1548
02:01:22,680 --> 02:01:24,079
<i>Aft right-hand corner.</i>

1549
02:01:24,148 --> 02:01:25,479
<i>Okay, this is what we're gonna do.</i>

1550
02:01:25,549 --> 02:01:27,141
<i>Start a rescue checklist, part two,</i>

1551
02:01:27,218 --> 02:01:29,152
<i>for a harness deployment
of the rescue swimmer.</i>

1552
02:01:29,220 --> 02:01:31,484
<i>- No trail line...
- Roger that. Backup pump is on.</i>

1553
02:01:31,555 --> 02:01:33,147
<i>All right, we'll do the hoist at 100 feet.</i>

1554
02:01:33,224 --> 02:01:34,555
<i>Roger that.</i>

1555
02:01:35,593 --> 02:01:38,460
<i>Kodiak Ops, Kodiak Ops,
rescue 6028.</i>

1556
02:01:38,529 --> 02:01:41,589
<i>Rescue 6028,
Kodiak Ops. Go ahead.</i>

1557
02:01:41,999 --> 02:01:44,661
<i>Swimmer's ready.
Load-checking swimmer.</i>

1558
02:01:46,437 --> 02:01:49,668
<i>And load check complete.
Swimmer's going out the door.</i>

1559
02:01:49,740 --> 02:01:52,971
<i>Swimmer's out the door.
Swimmer's on his way down.</i>

1560
02:02:08,058 --> 02:02:10,288
Coast Guard helo, do you copy?

1561
02:02:11,862 --> 02:02:14,592
Coast Guard helo,
this is Rescue Swimmer One.

1562
02:02:14,665 --> 02:02:15,689
Do you copy?

1563
02:02:15,766 --> 02:02:17,028
<i>Forward, right 40.</i>

1564
02:02:17,101 --> 02:02:18,625
<i>Forward, right 30. Watch your altitude.</i>

1565
02:02:18,702 --> 02:02:19,862
<i>Roger.</i>

1566
02:02:52,236 --> 02:02:54,204
<i>Hold.
I have a fouled cable. Fouled cable.</i>

1567
02:02:54,271 --> 02:02:55,795
<i>Paying out slack.</i>

1568
02:02:57,308 --> 02:03:00,141
Coast Guard helo,
this is Swimmer Number One!

1569
02:03:00,211 --> 02:03:03,806
I'm in the engine room,
and the hold of the boat is filling up!

1570
02:03:03,881 --> 02:03:05,872
<i>- He's trying to free the cable.
- Come on.</i>

1571
02:03:10,921 --> 02:03:13,355
<i>Okay, cable free. Cable free.</i>

1572
02:03:18,829 --> 02:03:19,921
<i>Attaboy.</i>

1573
02:03:21,565 --> 02:03:23,931
<i>Cable's free,
and I got a fray right here.</i>

1574
02:03:24,001 --> 02:03:26,868
<i>It's still good. It's still good.
I can use it. It's all we got.</i>

1575
02:03:26,937 --> 02:03:27,926
<i>All right, good.</i>

1576
02:03:28,005 --> 02:03:29,199
<i>Go back and left, Captain.</i>

1577
02:03:29,273 --> 02:03:30,672
<i>Back and left. Roger that.</i>

1578
02:03:36,080 --> 02:03:37,206
Jake.

1579
02:03:50,928 --> 02:03:52,156
Come on.

1580
02:03:52,329 --> 02:03:53,523
Come on.

1581
02:03:55,900 --> 02:03:57,026
Jake!

1582
02:04:02,573 --> 02:04:03,665
Jake!

1583
02:04:06,577 --> 02:04:07,601
Jake?

1584
02:04:07,678 --> 02:04:10,442
Senior? Senior, is that you?

1585
02:04:10,614 --> 02:04:11,979
Goldfish!

1586
02:04:12,116 --> 02:04:15,882
I checked all the locks on the door.
I can't get them loose. They're stuck.

1587
02:04:15,953 --> 02:04:18,012
No, no, I see the problem.

1588
02:04:19,023 --> 02:04:21,253
It's filling up, Senior Chief!

1589
02:04:21,692 --> 02:04:24,456
Senior Chief! Get me out of here!

1590
02:04:30,134 --> 02:04:32,534
I'm almost submerged!
You gotta get the door open!

1591
02:04:32,603 --> 02:04:34,093
Hold on, Jake.

1592
02:04:52,890 --> 02:04:55,017
Senior! The captain's body!

1593
02:04:55,359 --> 02:04:57,520
We gotta let him go. Come on.

1594
02:05:05,102 --> 02:05:06,592
Jake, he's gone!

1595
02:05:16,246 --> 02:05:17,338
Jake!

1596
02:05:19,850 --> 02:05:21,215
<i>I got both swimmers coming out.</i>

1597
02:05:21,285 --> 02:05:23,879
<i>- Both swimmers are in sight.
- All right, I got them.</i>

1598
02:05:41,872 --> 02:05:43,032
<i>Hook is going down.</i>

1599
02:05:43,107 --> 02:05:46,372
<i>Let's go forward, right 40.
Hook is halfway down.</i>

1600
02:05:46,510 --> 02:05:48,273
I'm hooking into you.

1601
02:05:48,345 --> 02:05:50,643
We're only gonna get one shot at this.

1602
02:05:53,550 --> 02:05:54,778
I'm in.

1603
02:05:56,086 --> 02:05:57,280
I'm in!

1604
02:06:11,201 --> 02:06:13,601
I thought you were going fishing.

1605
02:06:13,671 --> 02:06:15,571
What do you call this?

1606
02:06:21,078 --> 02:06:22,170
Whoa.

1607
02:06:24,615 --> 02:06:28,346
<i>The cable's starting
to part! The cable! Hold, hold, hold!</i>

1608
02:06:31,622 --> 02:06:33,749
<i>Okay, hold right there. Hold.
I'm bringing them up.</i>

1609
02:06:33,824 --> 02:06:36,452
<i>I gotta jam this cable into the drum.</i>

1610
02:06:44,001 --> 02:06:46,629
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

1611
02:06:49,006 --> 02:06:50,940
Don't even think about it.

1612
02:06:51,008 --> 02:06:53,135
It's not gonna hold us both.

1613
02:06:53,343 --> 02:06:54,503
What...

1614
02:06:54,845 --> 02:06:57,905
Yes, it will. Don't! lt'll hold!

1615
02:07:01,552 --> 02:07:03,577
<i>Senior fell. Senior fell!</i>

1616
02:07:05,923 --> 02:07:07,356
<i>Jake's got him. Jake's got him.</i>

1617
02:07:07,424 --> 02:07:09,187
<i>I gotta get them up.</i>

1618
02:07:30,781 --> 02:07:32,305
I won't let go!

1619
02:07:34,551 --> 02:07:35,711
I know.

1620
02:07:57,441 --> 02:07:58,931
Senior!

1621
02:08:01,378 --> 02:08:02,777
Senior!

1622
02:08:04,448 --> 02:08:05,938
Lower me down!

1623
02:08:06,950 --> 02:08:08,440
Lower me down!

1624
02:08:08,652 --> 02:08:11,246
<i>He just fell! He just fell!
Randall fell! Hit the water!</i>

1625
02:08:11,321 --> 02:08:12,310
Lower me down!

1626
02:08:12,389 --> 02:08:14,357
<i>He's in the water.
Been hit by a wave, full debris.</i>

1627
02:08:14,424 --> 02:08:15,891
<i>- Put me down!
- I can't!</i>

1628
02:08:15,959 --> 02:08:18,120
You gotta lower me down now!

1629
02:08:20,364 --> 02:08:21,991
Get me out of here!

1630
02:08:22,099 --> 02:08:24,465
<i>- You gotta lower me down!
- I can't!</i>

1631
02:08:24,535 --> 02:08:25,524
I'll free-fall!

1632
02:08:26,003 --> 02:08:30,133
<i>If I do, you don't come back.
I can't! I can't lose two!</i>

1633
02:08:32,876 --> 02:08:34,673
<i>Lost swimmer. Lost swimmer.</i>

1634
02:08:34,745 --> 02:08:37,646
<i>He saw the cable coming apart.
He just let go.</i>

1635
02:08:38,348 --> 02:08:40,179
<i>He was about 80, 90 feet up, sir.</i>

1636
02:08:40,250 --> 02:08:41,842
<i>He didn't come up. I don't see him.</i>

1637
02:08:41,919 --> 02:08:43,944
<i>Flash landing hover lights.</i>

1638
02:08:44,121 --> 02:08:45,418
<i>Monitor the radio, sir.</i>

1639
02:08:45,489 --> 02:08:48,856
<i>Look for flares, strobes, anything.
He fell right in the debris.</i>

1640
02:08:49,793 --> 02:08:52,660
<i>Lost swimmer. Lost swimmer.</i>

1641
02:09:03,640 --> 02:09:04,971
<i>The Coast Guard conducted</i>

1642
02:09:05,042 --> 02:09:06,839
<i>one of the largest
search-and-rescue missions</i>

1643
02:09:06,910 --> 02:09:08,707
<i>for a single man in its history,</i>

1644
02:09:10,681 --> 02:09:14,242
<i>but the body of Senior Chief
Ben Randall was never found.</i>

1645
02:09:23,660 --> 02:09:25,287
I'm sorry, Helen.

1646
02:09:26,597 --> 02:09:28,155
There's nothing more we can do.

1647
02:09:29,299 --> 02:09:31,062
<i>What makes a legend?</i>

1648
02:09:32,169 --> 02:09:34,364
<i>Is it what someone did
when they were alive...</i>

1649
02:09:34,438 --> 02:09:36,406
Randall never was much
for this sort of thing.

1650
02:09:36,473 --> 02:09:39,442
<i>or how they're remembered
after they're gone?</i>

1651
02:09:41,545 --> 02:09:43,479
<i>Some people actually believe</i>

1652
02:09:43,547 --> 02:09:46,846
<i>Senior Chief made the swim
to the Aleutian Islands.</i>

1653
02:09:47,784 --> 02:09:50,617
<i>He's standing
on a distant beach somewhere</i>

1654
02:09:50,721 --> 02:09:53,053
<i>with a fishing pole in his hand.</i>

1655
02:09:56,193 --> 02:09:59,026
<i>But I found my answer
a couple weeks later.</i>

1656
02:10:04,635 --> 02:10:06,000
Where is he?

1657
02:10:09,339 --> 02:10:11,170
There's nobody else out there, man.

1658
02:10:11,241 --> 02:10:12,833
No, he was there.

1659
02:10:13,810 --> 02:10:16,040
He was with me the whole time.

1660
02:10:16,213 --> 02:10:19,011
He said he would hold on
till help arrived.

1661
02:10:20,117 --> 02:10:21,744
He never let go.

1662
02:10:42,372 --> 02:10:46,001
<i>There's a legend of a man
who lives beneath the sea.</i>

1663
02:10:48,478 --> 02:10:50,343
<i>He is a fisher of men,</i>

1664
02:10:51,448 --> 02:10:54,781
<i>a last hope for all those
who have been left behind.</i>

1665
02:10:58,388 --> 02:11:00,549
<i>He is known as the Guardian.</i>

1666
02:11:03,527 --> 02:11:06,928
<i>Ben Randall always said
life is about making choices.</i>

1667
02:11:07,464 --> 02:11:11,400
<i>In the end, by making his,
he helped me make mine.</i>

1668
02:11:11,535 --> 02:11:13,002
What do you remember?

1669
02:11:13,070 --> 02:11:14,662
What did you smell?
What did you see?

1670
02:11:14,738 --> 02:11:16,569
How did this make you

1671
02:11:21,411 --> 02:11:22,469
feel?

1672
02:11:28,218 --> 02:11:29,845
I'll be right back.

1673
02:11:34,458 --> 02:11:36,449
What are you doing here?

1674
02:11:38,662 --> 02:11:40,152
I lied to you.

1675
02:11:41,798 --> 02:11:43,390
I can't do casual.
