<i>This is because</i>

<i>We are the best of the best.</i>

in the world than that.

00:23:14,550 --> 00:23:18,960
So, ladies and gentlemen, welcome.
Welcome to "A" School.

307
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:21,580
Are there any questions?

308
00:23:23,330 --> 00:23:26,730
JAKE: Captain, Airman Fischer.
Just have one question.

309
00:23:27,570 --> 00:23:31,030
That guy who holds all them records,
is he still alive?

310
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:32,530
Why do you ask?

311
00:23:32,610 --> 00:23:34,130
I just thought you ought to let him know

312
00:23:34,210 --> 00:23:35,970
I am about to knock his name
off that board.

313
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:38,440
CAPTAIN: Really?
Why don't you let him know yourself?

314
00:23:38,510 --> 00:23:41,970
He's standing right behind you
in the back of the room.

Class, turn around
and greet Senior Chief Ben Randall.

316
00:23:46,690 --> 00:23:51,280
Senior Chief Randall will be your
lead instructor for the next 18 weeks.

317
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:54,990
Senior Chief Randall is one of
the most decorated rescue swimmers

in the history
of the United States Coast Guard.

Ben, would you care
to address the class?

No, I think there's been enough talk
for one day.

Can I buy you a drink?

618
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:12,720
I don't think so.

619

You don't know what you're missing.

620
00:42:20,730 --> 00:42:22,960
You sure you want to go with that one?

621
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:25,630
That's, like, your top-of-the-line,
A-game material?

622
00:42:28,570 --> 00:42:31,670
See, the way I see it,
you got two choices here:

623
00:42:32,980 --> 00:42:34,210
walk away from me,

624
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:36,750
or walk out of here with me
and split the cash.

625
00:42:38,550 --> 00:42:39,540
Cash?

626
00:42:41,420 --> 00:42:42,790
What cash?

627
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:46,190
The money you bet your friends
you could pick me up.

628
00:42:48,690 --> 00:42:50,490
See, that makes me nervous.

00:42:58,770 --> 00:43:01,470
-About 20 seconds.
-Shall we?

-No way.

Okay, Jake, in the pool.

All right, now. Three letters.

I am actually not that cold anymore,
Senior Chief.

674
00:45:14,510 --> 00:45:18,000
You're not cold anymore
because blood is moving

at right now,

00:50:22,650 --> 00:50:24,240
people, is listing to the port side.

732
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:26,910
As a rescue swimmer, when you get
to the door of the helicopter,

733
00:50:26,990 --> 00:50:28,750
you need to look down
and pay attention

734

to what you really have down there.

735
00:50:31,260 --> 00:50:34,780
It's very important
that you understand your limitations.

Limitations without understanding
are going to get you killed.

Case in point, this vessel's trapped
in pancake ice in the Bering Sea.

00:50:43,140 --> 00:50:45,040
And as you can see,
the crew are out on the deck

00:50:45,100 --> 00:50:47,830
in a relatively manageable
hoisting position.

Those pieces of ice can weigh in
upwards of thousands of pounds.

Now imagine yourself trapped
in between 2,000-pound pieces of ice

Standardization is one of the reasons
we were so successful during Katrina.

748
00:51:12,830 --> 00:51:15,730
We had crews come in
from all over the country,

749
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:19,240
but it didn't matter, because we have
all been trained the same way.

750
00:51:19,300 --> 00:51:22,030
I didn't know my pilot,
I didn't know my copilot,

751
00:51:22,110 --> 00:51:24,130
I didn't know my flight mechanic.
But guess what?

752
00:51:24,210 --> 00:51:25,610
It didn't matter, because...

753

That's why we do it.

754

wrapped around that idea.

01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:21,690
Not all of them.

928
01:02:21,770 --> 01:02:24,260
There's one record you won't break.

929
01:02:25,340 --> 01:02:27,030
This is the <i>Aegis.</i>

930
01:02:28,370 --> 01:02:30,570
Medical ship. Caught on fire.

931
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:33,930
It was a nightmare.
People burning in their beds.

932
01:02:34,010 --> 01:02:36,670
And Ben Randall
got every one of those people off there,

933
01:02:36,750 --> 01:02:38,180
except for this one guy.

934
01:02:38,250 --> 01:02:40,620
And right when the ship
started to go down,

935
01:02:40,690 --> 01:02:42,980
he reaches down and grabs this guy.

936
01:02:43,250 --> 01:02:46,420
He's hanging from the cable
with this man's life in his hands,

937
01:02:46,490 --> 01:02:47,960
and the winch jams.

938
01:02:48,030 --> 01:02:51,550
It's 20 minutes to the base.
The man's screaming.

939
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,790
Ben looks him dead in the eye,
and you know what he said?

940
01:02:54,870 --> 01:02:56,600
He said, "I won't let go."

941
01:02:56,670 --> 01:02:57,930
What happened?

942
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:01,130
MAGGIE: Dislocated his shoulder,
tore every tendon in his hand.

943
01:03:01,210 --> 01:03:02,670
But he didn't let go.

944
01:03:02,740 --> 01:03:05,610
Twenty minutes, just fingertips.

945
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:09,440
You break that record
and you give me a call.

946
01:03:24,200 --> 01:03:25,590
My day was all right.

947
01:03:27,430 --> 01:03:30,060
<i>(ABBY AHMAD PLAYING</i>
TRI-ME)

948
01:04:37,700 --> 01:04:41,540
So here's my thinking.
We should go on a date.

949
01:04:43,010 --> 01:04:45,170
-Well, what do you call this?
-No, no, no.

950
01:04:45,240 --> 01:04:47,440
I am talking about, like, a real date.

951
01:04:47,510 --> 01:04:51,000
You know, with, like, a nice restaurant,
some nice clothes.

952
01:04:51,080 --> 01:04:53,070
I will get you some flowers.

953
01:04:53,150 --> 01:04:55,710
I thought we agreed
to keep this casual.

954
01:04:55,790 --> 01:04:57,980
Look, it's one steak. What is...

955
01:04:58,060 --> 01:05:03,250
One steak is not going to forge some
kind of a lasting emotional bond.

956
01:05:04,560 --> 01:05:06,030
I am serious.

957
01:05:06,400 --> 01:05:07,490
Yeah?

958
01:05:07,570 --> 01:05:09,530
-Yeah.
-So am I.

959
01:05:09,600 --> 01:05:12,070
It's one dinner. What's it going to hurt?

960
01:05:12,140 --> 01:05:15,260
Well, if you ordered a steak,
I'd imagine a cow would be involved.

961
01:05:15,340 --> 01:05:18,470
What do you have, an art gallery
over here? What is this "2"?

962
01:05:19,780 --> 01:05:23,440
It's so the guy behind me knows
what place he's coming in.

963
01:05:24,880 --> 01:05:26,010
What about this one?

964
01:05:26,080 --> 01:05:33,010
That is the initials of the guys
on my high school relay team.

965
01:05:33,890 --> 01:05:36,290
A drunken celebration gone wrong?

966
01:05:37,460 --> 01:05:39,260
Something like that.

967
01:05:39,860 --> 01:05:43,100
-So, about this date.
-God. It's just dinner, right?

968
01:05:43,170 --> 01:05:48,160
No flowers, where we will discuss
nothing emotional or important?

969
01:05:49,570 --> 01:05:51,600
I am fully prepared

970
01:05:52,080 --> 01:05:56,670
to do an entire hour
on nothing but the Chicago Bears.

971
01:05:57,150 --> 01:05:59,310
And we can have
completely meaningless sex

972
01:05:59,380 --> 01:06:01,280
immediately afterwards.

973
01:06:01,350 --> 01:06:04,750
You think I am going to sleep with you
on our first date?

974
01:06:05,220 --> 01:06:06,690
Think again.

(CHUCKLING)

976
01:06:08,390 --> 01:06:10,120
You just head-butted me.

977
01:06:10,390 --> 01:06:12,760
I am going to teach you the breaststroke.

978
01:06:12,830 --> 01:06:17,530
It's pretty complicated,
different than that of the butterfly.

979
01:06:21,470 --> 01:06:24,870
I guess I can't sleep.

980
01:06:27,180 --> 01:06:29,170
Well, of course you can't.

981
01:06:30,480 --> 01:06:32,680
Your wife left you.
Your best friend died.

982
01:06:32,750 --> 01:06:34,740
You sound like a damn country song.

983
01:06:34,820 --> 01:06:37,520
If you had a dog,
he'd be run over by now.

984
01:06:37,590 --> 01:06:40,420
-So, did she send you papers?
-Yeah.

985
01:06:40,760 --> 01:06:42,250
And did you read them?

986
01:06:44,260 --> 01:06:45,250
No, I did not.

987
01:06:45,960 --> 01:06:48,490
Well, you think you might ought to?

988
01:06:55,110 --> 01:06:57,370
You know,
there never was anyone else, Mags.

989
01:06:57,440 --> 01:06:59,030
Like hell, Ben.

990
01:07:00,440 --> 01:07:02,140
You're a bigamist.

991
01:07:02,910 --> 01:07:05,310
You been married to the Coast Guard
all along.

992
01:07:05,380 --> 01:07:07,280
Give me that shoulder.

993
01:07:07,790 --> 01:07:12,350
You probably swum it out of socket
trying to prove you're still 19.

994
01:07:12,990 --> 01:07:14,460
Am I right?

995
01:07:18,300 --> 01:07:20,490
When the heck did we get old?

996
01:07:20,560 --> 01:07:22,830
Hell, I have always been old, Ben.

997
01:07:22,900 --> 01:07:24,730
You know what, though? I don't mind.

998
01:07:24,800 --> 01:07:27,460
I mean, if my muscles ache,
it's because I have used them.

999
01:07:27,540 --> 01:07:29,700
If it's hard for me
to walk up them steps now,

1000
01:07:29,770 --> 01:07:34,540
it's because I walked up them every night
to lay next to a man who loved me.

1001
01:07:34,610 --> 01:07:36,100
I got a few wrinkles here and there,

1002
01:07:36,180 --> 01:07:40,880
but I have laid under thousands of skies
on sunny days, yeah.

1003
01:07:42,050 --> 01:07:46,510
I look and feel this way,
well, because I drank and I smoked,

1004
01:07:46,590 --> 01:07:50,360
I lived and I loved,
and danced, sang, sweat

1005
01:07:50,430 --> 01:07:53,920
and screwed my way
through a pretty damned good life,

1006
01:07:54,070 --> 01:07:55,660
if you ask me.

1007
01:07:55,770 --> 01:07:57,830
Getting old ain't bad, Ben.

1008
01:07:57,900 --> 01:08:00,000
Getting old, that's earned.

(GRUNTS)

1010
01:08:33,870 --> 01:08:36,270
BEN: There will come a time
when you might have to decide

1011
01:08:36,340 --> 01:08:38,210
who lives and dies out there.

1012
01:08:39,740 --> 01:08:41,140
It's a terrible responsibility,

1013
01:08:41,310 --> 01:08:44,640
but it is one you will have to make
as a rescue swimmer.

1014
01:08:47,820 --> 01:08:49,220
The bigger reality is,

1015
01:08:50,450 --> 01:08:53,010
it's also something
you're going to have to live with

1016
01:08:53,120 --> 01:08:54,450
as a human being.

1017
01:08:57,890 --> 01:09:01,890
There will come a time
when you're going to have to say no.

1018
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:07,160
The most important person
to keep alive is yourself.

1019
01:09:08,170 --> 01:09:14,130
You will be facing crews from five to 20,
all saying, "Save me, save me."

They're looking for a miracle.

1021
01:09:17,310 --> 01:09:20,110
-How old are you, Hodge?
-Twenty-four.

1022
01:09:20,420 --> 01:09:23,780
At 24 years old,
you have to become that miracle.

1023
01:09:24,090 --> 01:09:27,390
You have to find a way
to be that miracle.

looking center, looking left.

The only difference
between you and the victim

is the attitude
in which you enter the water.

You have got to figure out
a way to be calm

1036
01:10:43,070 --> 01:10:45,800
in the face of chaos.
Do you understand?

1037
01:10:49,040 --> 01:10:51,670
That's your first challenge, Charlie.

1038
01:10:52,140 --> 01:10:54,470
One more and you're gone.

1039
01:10:57,210 --> 01:11:00,380
-Come out.
-Aye, aye, Senior Chief.

What's up, Big Fisch?

1041
01:11:15,900 --> 01:11:18,590
You don't have to take his shit, Hodge.

1042
01:11:19,330 --> 01:11:22,500
What do you know?
It's so easy for you, Fischer.

1043
01:11:22,970 --> 01:11:24,030
Is that right?

1044
01:11:25,440 --> 01:11:26,430
Yeah.

You know, you don't get it.

1046
01:11:30,280 --> 01:11:32,840
You don't realize
that you're tougher than I am.

1047
01:11:32,910 --> 01:11:34,070
And how's that?

1048
01:11:34,150 --> 01:11:37,050
Well, if I get kicked out of here,
I am not coming back.

1049
01:11:37,120 --> 01:11:39,450
I am definitely not coming back twice.

1050
01:11:39,520 --> 01:11:41,280
I mean, you got guts, man.

1051
01:11:41,360 --> 01:11:42,690
Stupidity.

1052
01:11:43,530 --> 01:11:45,650
How long you been here, man?

1053
01:11:47,400 --> 01:11:50,330
Altogether... I don't know,
10 weeks the first time,

1054
01:11:50,400 --> 01:11:54,300
-six weeks, two days the second time...
-Six weeks this time.

1055
01:11:54,370 --> 01:11:55,530
So basically, you have been here

01:11:55,600 --> 01:11:57,940
longer than anybody
that's graduated this place,

1057

Lighten up on yourself, man.

Yeah, but it's not till 9:00.

-Wait a minute. Where are we going?

I mean, there's Navy guys everywhere.

I don't give a shit. A beer's a beer.

1067
01:12:33,240 --> 01:12:36,540
When you're pulling through the water,
you're going to pull yourself through.

1068
01:12:37,250 --> 01:12:38,640
-Like, you know...
-So I will go fast.

1069
01:12:38,710 --> 01:12:41,150
No, you want to lay to your side
and pull it like that.

Yeah, I will believe that when I see it.

When storms shut down entire ports,
you know who goes out?

1081
01:13:10,910 --> 01:13:12,210
We do.

1082
01:13:12,280 --> 01:13:14,870
When hurricanes...
When hurricanes ground the US Navy,

1083
01:13:14,950 --> 01:13:18,580
like these little guys over here,
guess who goes out?

1084
01:13:18,650 --> 01:13:20,180
That's right, we do.

1085
01:13:20,260 --> 01:13:22,950
Look, honey,
you better keep it down in here, okay?

1086
01:13:23,020 --> 01:13:24,960
Okay, honey. She called me "honey."

1087
01:13:26,530 --> 01:13:27,720
Okay, honey.

1088
01:13:27,800 --> 01:13:30,790
But when God himself reaches down
from heaven...

1089
01:13:31,500 --> 01:13:34,370
-What does he do, Jake, when he...
-Rips houses off the foundation.

1090
01:13:34,440 --> 01:13:37,800
When God himself rips houses
off the foundation, we go out,

1091
01:13:37,870 --> 01:13:39,570
because we are rescue swimmers,

1092
01:13:39,640 --> 01:13:42,240
and that is our job,
and that's what we do.

1093
01:13:42,310 --> 01:13:44,440
You might want to
recheck your compass.

1094
01:13:44,510 --> 01:13:46,910
This ain't no puddle pirate bar.

1095
01:13:55,590 --> 01:13:58,420
No problem,
because we were just leaving anyway.

1096
01:13:58,490 --> 01:14:00,150
-Sit down, Hodge.
-Jake.

1097
01:14:00,230 --> 01:14:01,920
-Finish your beer.
-Jake.

1098
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:03,620
Yeah, sit, Hodge.

1099
01:14:04,300 --> 01:14:06,060
HODGE: That's my beer, man.

1100
01:14:11,070 --> 01:14:12,540
Finished now?

1101
01:14:14,280 --> 01:14:16,140
Must be happy hour.

1102
01:14:16,380 --> 01:14:17,470
(GRUNTS)

1103
01:14:18,450 --> 01:14:19,780
(ALL SCREAMING)

1104
01:14:19,920 --> 01:14:21,080
(GLASS BREAKING)

1105
01:14:21,150 --> 01:14:22,140
Hey!

1106
01:14:23,650 --> 01:14:24,680
Back off.

1107
01:14:27,260 --> 01:14:29,750
Everyone in this place is retired Navy.

1108
01:14:29,820 --> 01:14:32,550
Hey. Hey, when do I get
that phone call?

1109
01:14:33,190 --> 01:14:36,650
I know I get a phone call.
When do I get my phone call?

1110
01:14:41,940 --> 01:14:43,460
Ma'am, I am sorry,

1111
01:14:43,540 --> 01:14:46,170
but if nobody come in 20 minutes,
I need the table.

1112
01:14:46,540 --> 01:14:47,600
-Okay.
-I am sorry.

1113
01:14:47,680 --> 01:14:48,770
Yeah.

1114
01:14:53,150 --> 01:14:55,080
She's never going to talk to me again.

1115
01:14:56,020 --> 01:14:58,420
You know they're going to
kick us out for this, right?

1116
01:14:58,490 --> 01:14:59,650
Yep.

1117
01:15:03,860 --> 01:15:06,090
Least they can't say we quit.

1118
01:15:07,160 --> 01:15:11,430
I was never going to make it, anyway.
Skinner's right. Panic every time.

1119
01:15:12,800 --> 01:15:14,630
Man, screw Skinner.

1120
01:15:16,070 --> 01:15:17,900
I am Skinner. Break my hold.

1121
01:15:17,970 --> 01:15:20,460
Hey, what are you doing, man?
Come on, Fischer, get off me.

1122
01:15:20,540 --> 01:15:21,800
Clock's ticking. Break it.

1123
01:15:21,880 --> 01:15:25,110
Fischer, you're hurting me, man.
Fischer, get off me, man!

1124
01:15:26,110 --> 01:15:28,780
Come on, Fischer, you're hurting me.
Fischer, man, get off!

1125
01:15:28,850 --> 01:15:30,880
-Break the goddamn hold.
-Fischer, get off me, man!

1126
01:15:30,950 --> 01:15:33,550
-Break the goddamn hold, Hodge.
-Fischer, get off me!

1127
01:15:35,060 --> 01:15:36,720
I said, get off me!

1128
01:15:37,190 --> 01:15:38,390
All right.

1129
01:15:38,660 --> 01:15:41,860
Now, it's just like that
when you're in the water.

1130
01:15:44,830 --> 01:15:47,890
Well, now. We could come back.

1131
01:15:48,370 --> 01:15:51,740
Give you boys time for a smoke
and some pillow talk.

1132
01:15:59,780 --> 01:16:01,040
JAKE: You can't kick us out.

1133
01:16:01,120 --> 01:16:03,240
SKINNER: It's called disorderly
conduct, and yes, we can.

1134
01:16:03,320 --> 01:16:05,950
-We didn't fail at nothing.
-Our profession is all about control.

1135
01:16:06,020 --> 01:16:07,750
You both failed miserably
in that department.

1136
01:16:07,820 --> 01:16:09,620
Hold it right there.

1137
01:16:09,690 --> 01:16:11,490
-Senior?
-Yeah, come in.

1138
01:16:14,260 --> 01:16:16,390
Their disenrollment records.

1139
01:16:18,200 --> 01:16:19,530
BEN: Bar fight?

1140
01:16:21,040 --> 01:16:23,160
-All right, bring them in.
-Senior.

1141
01:16:23,270 --> 01:16:24,600
Square it.

1142
01:16:31,410 --> 01:16:34,610
It's all my fault, Senior Chief.
Hodge had nothing to do with it.

1143
01:16:36,380 --> 01:16:38,580
-That true, Hodge?
-It's true.

1144
01:16:42,490 --> 01:16:45,190
All right. Fine, you're dismissed.

1145
01:16:45,660 --> 01:16:49,620
-Senior Chief, I was...
-I said that you are dismissed.

1146
01:16:50,500 --> 01:16:51,760
Let's go.

1147
01:16:58,870 --> 01:17:01,600
You're going to kick me out
for defending the Coast Guard?

1148
01:17:02,080 --> 01:17:04,170
The Coast Guard's been around
for 200 years.

1149
01:17:04,250 --> 01:17:07,580
I doubt a couple of knuckleheads
like yourself are going to defend it.

1150
01:17:07,950 --> 01:17:09,180
Sit down.

1151
01:17:12,690 --> 01:17:16,280
I have been trying to peel the layers
back on you for a while now, and I...

1152
01:17:16,590 --> 01:17:17,820
I just don't get it.

1153
01:17:19,330 --> 01:17:21,420
I mean, this kind of work
seems a little remedial

1154
01:17:21,500 --> 01:17:22,520
for someone like yourself.

1155
01:17:22,600 --> 01:17:25,000
You know, big swim champ,
offer to every lvy League.

1156
01:17:25,070 --> 01:17:27,730
You give it all up to be here with us.

1157
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:32,500
-Why?
-I am here to save lives, Senior Chief.

1158
01:17:36,810 --> 01:17:39,040
I spoke with your coach, Jake.

1159
01:17:41,250 --> 01:17:43,720
-You spoke with my coach?
-Yeah, I spoke with your coach.

1160
01:17:43,790 --> 01:17:47,150
Something in your file
just kept hanging me up.

1161
01:17:47,220 --> 01:17:50,680
You win the state championship
your freshman and sophomore year

1162
01:17:50,760 --> 01:17:53,420
and then you don't swim the next two.

1163
01:17:53,700 --> 01:17:57,130
I am just a public school guy,
so pardon me,

1164
01:17:57,200 --> 01:18:00,960
but it didn't add up until now.

1165
01:18:07,180 --> 01:18:10,370
"Kirk Holloway,
100-meter medley winner,

1166
01:18:11,210 --> 01:18:13,680
"thrown through the passenger window.

1167
01:18:13,750 --> 01:18:16,050
"Pronounced dead at the scene.

1168
01:18:17,550 --> 01:18:22,510
"Abe lkeman, first team All-American,
lungs crushed.

1169
01:18:25,560 --> 01:18:29,520
"Carl Sandoval,
50-meter freestyle champ,

1170
01:18:29,600 --> 01:18:34,230
"made it all the way to the hospital.
Died of internal bleeding."

1171
01:18:43,780 --> 01:18:46,510
I guess you just know everything, then.

1172
01:18:47,350 --> 01:18:49,940
I know what it's like to lose a team.

1173
01:18:51,390 --> 01:18:52,510
Yeah?

1174
01:18:52,790 --> 01:18:54,190
What about living in a small town

1175
01:18:54,260 --> 01:18:56,380
where everyone thinks
that you killed their brother

1176
01:18:56,460 --> 01:18:58,020
or their son or their best friend?

1177
01:18:58,090 --> 01:18:59,490
You know about that?

1178
01:19:00,430 --> 01:19:03,860
Kind of small town where everyone
still waves to everyone,

1179
01:19:05,100 --> 01:19:06,690
just not to you?

1180
01:19:09,100 --> 01:19:13,010
I read the report, Jake.
Your blood alcohol was zip that night.

1181
01:19:14,040 --> 01:19:17,170
I am guessing there was a flip
for designated driver.

1182
01:19:17,250 --> 01:19:18,540
You lost.

1183
01:19:19,580 --> 01:19:21,670
Guess that just makes it
all go away, huh?

1184
01:19:21,750 --> 01:19:24,980
No, it doesn't make it all right.
It just makes it an accident.

1185
01:19:25,490 --> 01:19:27,510
At least that's how it reads.

1186
01:19:28,860 --> 01:19:30,520
You were 16 years old, Jake.

1187
01:19:30,590 --> 01:19:33,120
I am not your priest, but if 
I was, I think...

1188
01:19:33,600 --> 01:19:35,690
I think maybe you'd deserve a pass.

1189
01:19:39,230 --> 01:19:41,260
You're giving me a pass?

1190
01:19:41,440 --> 01:19:45,570
You just think you know everything
with your psychobabble bullshit.

1191
01:19:45,640 --> 01:19:47,670
Why am I here? Why are you here?

1192
01:19:49,080 --> 01:19:51,770
You're too old to be doing this.
You're washed-up here.

1193
01:19:51,850 --> 01:19:55,410
You don't want to be teaching
a bunch of kids in a pool. Am I right?

1194
01:19:55,480 --> 01:19:58,880
I don't give a shit what you read
or who you talked to.

1195
01:19:58,950 --> 01:20:02,890
You don't know about me! You don't...
I have me under control.

1196
01:20:07,430 --> 01:20:08,950
I can see that.

1197
01:20:28,080 --> 01:20:30,850
The only difference
between you and me is,

1198
01:20:32,390 --> 01:20:35,550
I don't wear the ones I lost
on my arm, Jake.

1199
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:46,230
I know where you're at, Jake.

1200
01:20:47,140 --> 01:20:48,830
I am there myself.

1201
01:20:51,070 --> 01:20:54,600
I ask myself every day
why I was the one that survived.

1202
01:20:59,910 --> 01:21:02,140
-And?
-And...

1203
01:21:04,950 --> 01:21:06,480
And if I can't answer that for me,

1204
01:21:06,550 --> 01:21:09,960
I am certainly not going to try
and answer it for you.

1205
01:21:14,760 --> 01:21:16,160
Have a seat.

1206
01:21:22,600 --> 01:21:25,730
I want you
to start being a member of this team,

1207
01:21:26,940 --> 01:21:28,810
the team you have now.

1208
01:21:30,080 --> 01:21:31,980
You have a gift, Jake.

1209
01:21:32,350 --> 01:21:34,410
You're the best swimmer
to come through this program,

1210
01:21:34,480 --> 01:21:35,680
hands down, by far.

1211
01:21:35,750 --> 01:21:37,680
You got a whole record board
to prove it.

1212
01:21:37,750 --> 01:21:40,450
But you know what I see
when I look at it?

1213
01:21:40,520 --> 01:21:43,980
I see someone fast enough
who's going to get there first.

1214
01:21:45,190 --> 01:21:47,320
I see someone strong enough
who's going to last.

1215
01:21:47,400 --> 01:21:52,090
I see someone who can save a life
that maybe nobody else could.

1216
01:21:54,440 --> 01:21:57,560
You really want to honor
the initials on your arm?

1217
01:21:58,870 --> 01:22:00,700
Then honor your gift.

1218
01:22:03,680 --> 01:22:05,810
Save the ones you can, Jake.

1219
01:22:07,250 --> 01:22:10,620
The rest, we have got to let go.

1220
01:22:21,430 --> 01:22:23,560
Does this mean
you're not going to fail me?

1221
01:22:24,370 --> 01:22:28,130
For what, backing up a buddy in a bar?

1222
01:22:31,040 --> 01:22:33,560
Man, I got bigger problems than you.

1223
01:22:36,810 --> 01:22:40,340
I don't know about you,
but I could use a fucking drink.

1224
01:22:45,190 --> 01:22:46,310
Oops.

1225
01:22:48,820 --> 01:22:52,690
I am going to consider everything 
tonight off-record and off-duty.

1226
01:22:56,500 --> 01:22:57,660
That was an invite.

1227
01:22:58,470 --> 01:22:59,460
Oh.

1228
01:23:03,810 --> 01:23:05,770
You got to be kidding me.

1229
01:23:06,370 --> 01:23:10,070
-What was it they called you?
-"Puddle pirates," but it's not...

1230
01:23:10,140 --> 01:23:13,880
I am way over it, Senior Chief. 
This is...

1231
01:23:14,350 --> 01:23:17,720
-Well, it's like sticks and stones.
-Well, we will just have one beer.

01:36:47,330 --> 01:36:50,020
You fix things up with that young lady?

1389
01:36:51,270 --> 01:36:54,030
Well, you still have a choice, you know.

1390
01:36:56,400 --> 01:37:00,570
Hey, there's a question
I wanted to ask you back in school

1391
01:37:01,340 --> 01:37:02,430
and I didn't.

1392
01:37:03,440 --> 01:37:06,570
But when you can't save them all,

1393
01:37:08,580 --> 01:37:10,710
how do you choose who lives?

1394
01:37:12,190 --> 01:37:15,120
It's probably different
for everybody, Jake.

1395
01:37:16,220 --> 01:37:18,990
Kind of simple for me, though. I just...

1396
01:37:19,330 --> 01:37:23,420
I take the first one I come to
or the weakest one in the group,

1397
01:37:23,500 --> 01:37:27,160
and then I swim
as fast and as hard as I can

1398
01:37:28,200 --> 01:37:29,760
for as long as I can.

1399
01:37:31,910 --> 01:37:34,030
And the sea takes the rest.

1400
01:37:39,110 --> 01:37:40,700
Think I am ready?

1401
01:37:42,550 --> 01:37:46,820
I am not your teacher anymore, Jake.
I am just your fellow swimmer.

1402
01:37:46,890 --> 01:37:49,950
That's not exactly
the answer I am looking for there.

1403
01:37:50,020 --> 01:37:53,980
If I did not think you were ready,
I would not put you in the Bering Sea.

Yeah.

1523
01:46:52,370 --> 01:46:54,830
Guys like us don't go fishing.

1524

Where have I heard that before?

Senior, before you go,

1526
01:47:10,220 --> 01:47:12,120
I got to know one thing.

1527
01:47:12,750 --> 01:47:14,720
What's your real number?

1528
01:47:19,930 --> 01:47:21,290
Twenty-two.

1529
01:47:24,200 --> 01:47:25,530
Twenty-two?

1530
01:47:27,700 --> 01:47:31,800
That's not bad. It's not 200. It's not...

1531
01:47:31,870 --> 01:47:34,930
Twenty-two's the number of people
I lost, Jake.

1532
01:47:36,110 --> 01:47:38,240
Only number I kept track of.

1533
01:47:56,560 --> 01:47:58,860
Keeps the sea out of your mouth.

1534
01:48:37,900 --> 01:48:38,930
Hey.

1535
01:48:39,740 --> 01:48:40,730
Hi.

1536
01:48:43,340 --> 01:48:45,440
You started painting again?

1537
01:48:46,410 --> 01:48:48,510
Yeah. Great light up there.

1538
01:48:56,760 --> 01:48:58,020
You know,

1539
01:48:59,690 --> 01:49:02,720
I want to apologize
for the phone calls, Helen.

1540
01:49:04,260 --> 01:49:06,660
I should have given you your space.

1541
01:49:08,030 --> 01:49:09,870
And you felt
