Love the pie.

23
00:01:52,028 --> 00:01:55,448
I just realized that Inever wished you good luck.

24
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:57,909
Probably because youdon't really mean it.

25
00:01:57,951 --> 00:02:00,578
Look, I was going totell you, Faye, I just...

26
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:03,997
Tell me what? That you've thrownall our plans in the garbage

27
00:02:03,998 --> 00:02:06,667
and you're going to opena bakery without me?

28
00:02:06,668 --> 00:02:09,796
It was my father's decision. It's his money, Faye,

29
00:02:09,838 --> 00:02:12,006
and he wanted togamble on me, alone.

30
00:02:12,048 --> 00:02:14,842
Sure, after I've taughtyou everything you know.

31
00:02:14,843 --> 00:02:17,512
You've never had a cookinglesson. If it wasn't for me,

32
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:20,098
you'd still be usingpre-made cookie dough.

33
00:02:20,139 --> 00:02:21,266
How dare you?

00:02:21,307 --> 00:02:22,851

35
00:02:22,892 --> 00:02:24,686
Yeesh!

36
00:02:24,727 --> 00:02:26,687
It's been years sincel've used that stuff!

37
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:28,106
Yeah right.

38
00:02:28,147 --> 00:02:29,690
You only had one win!

39
00:02:29,691 --> 00:02:32,526
Pre-made cookie dough.

40
00:02:32,527 --> 00:02:35,196
This wasn't my call! If I wantedthe space on Fuller Street,

41
00:02:35,238 --> 00:02:37,030
I had to accept hisoffer immediately.

42
00:02:37,031 --> 00:02:39,701
Even if it meantstabbing me in the back?

43
00:02:39,742 --> 00:02:44,706
Ok ladies, let's leave theknives in the food please.

44
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:51,879
Looks like we may have tocancel our golf game tomorrow.

45
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,548
Are you kidding me?

46
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:57,635
It looks like it mightbe canceled permanently.

47
00:02:57,677 --> 00:02:59,929
Yeah.

48
00:02:59,971 --> 00:03:04,057
Faye! Please. You're my best friend.

49
00:03:04,058 --> 00:03:07,228
We never made definite plans. It was all just a pipe-dream.

50
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:09,105
Oh, so that bankloan I applied for,

51
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:09,981
that was just a "pipe-dream"?

52
00:03:10,231 --> 00:03:11,941
Look, I'm sorryabout that. I am...

53
00:03:11,983 --> 00:03:14,986
Don't be. Really. Idon't need you, Lydia.

54
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:17,197
I'm going to openmy own bake shop.

55
00:03:17,238 --> 00:03:18,406
Right Reggie?

56
00:03:18,448 --> 00:03:21,034
Um... yeah?

57
00:03:21,075 --> 00:03:24,621
And for your information, lalready have a line of credit,

58
00:03:24,662 --> 00:03:27,999
a life time of recipes and thishere trophy, which I'm going

59
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:33,086
to display prominently in thefront window of my new bakery.

60
00:03:33,087 --> 00:03:36,090
Are you sure you want to gohead-to-head with me, Faye?

61
00:03:36,132 --> 00:03:38,426
Is that a threat?

62
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:40,386
It's a dare.

63
00:03:40,428 --> 00:03:44,724
Well, I guess this is war.

64
00:03:44,766 --> 00:03:46,726
Take care, Reg.

65
00:03:46,768 --> 00:03:49,729
Take care, Max.

66
00:04:24,222 --> 00:04:29,185
Casey? I need youfor a taste test.

67
00:04:29,227 --> 00:04:34,315
Casey, I need youfor a taste test!

68
00:04:36,317 --> 00:04:38,361
Shoot!

69
00:04:40,071 --> 00:04:42,240
We need to fix that thing.

70
00:04:42,281 --> 00:04:44,659
Casey?

71
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:47,161
Yeah?

72
00:04:47,203 --> 00:04:50,039
Hey, Mom, I'm revising ouroperating budget and I

73
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:52,792
need you to take a lookat these line items...

74
00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:55,795
Casey, I don't knowwhat any of this means.

75
00:04:55,837 --> 00:04:56,963
That's why I've got you!

76
00:04:57,255 --> 00:05:00,883
Well, it means, if we cut a fewspecialty items off the menu

77
00:05:00,925 --> 00:05:05,096
we could come out of thered. Maybe, I hope...

78
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:06,513
I'm alsodeveloping a new

79
00:05:06,514 --> 00:05:07,974
advertising andmarketing plan for us.

80
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:10,101
And how much isthat going to cost?

81
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:11,561
I promise I'llbe conservative.

82
00:05:11,602 --> 00:05:14,689
Well, if we get The BuckeyeHotel account, we may not

83
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:19,777
have to worry, right? We'd bebaking a lot of pastries for

84
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:20,945
a lot ofcontinental breakfasts.

85
00:05:21,237 --> 00:05:24,574
Yeah, of course, but I can'tbudget based on "what ifs."

86
00:05:24,615 --> 00:05:27,285
I'm figuring this out froma strategic standpoint.

87
00:05:27,326 --> 00:05:29,162
You just focuson the baking.

88
00:05:29,203 --> 00:05:31,789
Speaking of which, come. I want you to sample

89
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:34,207
the front-runners forthis year's bake-off.

90
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:35,460
Okay.

91
00:05:37,211 --> 00:05:40,798
That's why we're introuble, you know.

92
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:44,218
In the past, profitssoared every time I won.

93
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:48,181
But now? Losing threeyears in a row to that...

94
00:05:48,222 --> 00:05:51,350
that traitor, Lydia Harper.

95
00:05:51,392 --> 00:05:53,478
I bet her bakeryis booming.

96
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:56,897
I know, but this is your year... I can feel it!

97
00:05:56,898 --> 00:06:00,234
And I promise you, we'regoing to turn the ship around.

98
00:06:00,276 --> 00:06:02,695
From your lips toGod's ears, honey.

99
00:06:02,737 --> 00:06:04,489
[Pots falling] Ow!

100
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:06,032

[Door closing]

102
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:17,919
What are you doinghere so late, Case?

103
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,962
I just came to checkup on her again.

104
00:06:20,004 --> 00:06:23,049
She's resting. The medicationis helping the physical pain

105
00:06:23,091 --> 00:06:27,678
but the mental pain isanother matter entirely.

106
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,806
Did they really saysix weeks off her feet?

107
00:06:29,847 --> 00:06:31,849
Could be longer ifit doesn't heal right.

108
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:35,686
Just pray shedoesn't need surgery.

109
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:37,647
I should've fixedthat step sooner.

110
00:06:37,688 --> 00:06:40,108
C'mon, you both hada lot on your plate.

111
00:06:40,149 --> 00:06:42,026
Well, I already arrangedfor a substitute baker for

112
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:44,195
the morning, but that'sall we can afford now.

113
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:48,615
Unless you want to takeon some of the baking.

114
00:06:48,616 --> 00:06:52,120
Of course, we all know whathappened the last time...

115
00:06:52,161 --> 00:06:54,413
You start one fire andthen you are marked for life.

116
00:06:54,455 --> 00:06:56,958
I'm just grateful thatthe fire department

117
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:58,292
Is only three blocks away.

118
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,921
Alright, well I'll justfocus on working on that

119
00:07:01,963 --> 00:07:04,841
hotel account and thenew baker can focus on

120
00:07:04,882 --> 00:07:06,801
cooking until Mom'sback on her feet.

121
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:08,635
I have it allfigured out.

122
00:07:08,636 --> 00:07:11,138
Not all of it...

123
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:13,891
Oh no, the bake-off!

124
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:15,726
Yep.

125
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:17,645
That's not good! Whatare we going to do?

126
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:19,646
You're the public faceof The Sweet Factory now,

127
00:07:19,647 --> 00:07:21,524
you're going to haveto do it in her place.

129
00:07:24,318 --> 00:07:25,819
Oh, you're serious!

130
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:28,573
Why not? You're a smart girl. You got a 4.0 at Wharton.

131

Dad! I almost burneddown the store.

132
00:07:30,658 --> 00:07:33,786
Case, you didn't burn downthe store, and furthermore,

133
00:07:33,828 --> 00:07:35,329
I believe in you.

134
00:07:35,371 --> 00:07:38,791
I don't believe in me. Notwhen it comes to the kitchen.

135
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:41,377
Go talk to your mother, see what she thinks.

136
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:45,882
And stop worrying, we're insuredif you burn down the place.

137
00:07:45,923 --> 00:07:49,343
Cute, Dad. Really cute.

138
00:07:53,097 --> 00:07:54,807
You want to enterthe bake-off?

139
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:55,933
No, but someone has to.

140
00:07:56,225 --> 00:07:59,061
I'm just going to have to dothis myself, we have no choice.

141

[Groaning]

142
00:08:00,188 --> 00:08:01,731
You were saying?

143
00:08:01,772 --> 00:08:03,191
You have to stayoff that ankle.

144
00:08:03,232 --> 00:08:05,610
You can't stand foran hour, baking.

145
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:08,695
But we have to winthis thing, Casey.

146
00:08:08,696 --> 00:08:10,823
Our businessdepends on it.

147
00:08:10,865 --> 00:08:11,949
Look, maybeit's not so bad.

148
00:08:12,283 --> 00:08:14,744
The bake-off is the centerpiecefor the harvest festival,

149
00:08:14,785 --> 00:08:18,247
everyone pays attention, but it needs a new story.

150
00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:20,917
I mean, your big feudwith Lydia Harper

151
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:23,877
is hardly a feudif she keeps winning.

152
00:08:23,878 --> 00:08:26,172
And that story is you?

153
00:08:26,214 --> 00:08:28,174
Me going up against her?

154
00:08:28,216 --> 00:08:31,594
That'll get peopletalking about our place.

155
00:08:31,636 --> 00:08:34,639
Okay, I'm listening.

156
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:37,724
Grandma passed all of herrecipes on to you, right?

157
00:08:37,725 --> 00:08:41,896
You get to pass this on tome. It's the circle of life.

158
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:45,191
And maybe we get somefree press out of it.

159
00:08:45,233 --> 00:08:46,692
Come on Mom, let me try.

160
00:08:46,734 --> 00:08:49,904
For the bakery. For us.

161
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:52,907
Okay, for us.

162
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:55,451
And we've got enoughinsurance, so...

163
00:08:55,493 --> 00:08:57,911
Why does everyone keepsaying that? It's not funny.

164
00:08:57,912 --> 00:08:59,579
I'm just kidding.

165
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:03,751
But seriously, you needto beat Lydia Harper.

166
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:05,878
Because all this publicityyou've been talking about,

167
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,881
it may help our businesswith some tourists,

168
00:09:08,923 --> 00:09:14,720
but a winning the bake-offwill bring in the locals.

169
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:18,057
Okay.

170
00:09:19,308 --> 00:09:20,768
I can do that.

171
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:22,395
Good.

00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:36,200

175
00:09:43,624 --> 00:09:45,792

177
00:09:48,629 --> 00:09:53,050
Ah, that time of theyear already, is it?

178
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:54,885
All these years and you'restill having someone

179
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:56,971
sneak you Faye McArthy'spumpkin scones?

180
00:09:57,013 --> 00:10:00,141
I hate myself forliking them so much.

181
00:10:00,182 --> 00:10:04,270
I have tried to recreatethis recipe a dozen times!

182
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:09,983
Well, I have something deliciousthat'll take your mind off that.

183
00:10:09,984 --> 00:10:14,363
I already told you, Sam, we're not expanding the menu.

184
00:10:14,405 --> 00:10:16,032
Is this or is thisnot our business?

185
00:10:16,073 --> 00:10:19,159
It is our business butl'm still in charge.

186
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:22,663
Look Mom, you've won thebake-off three years in a row.

187
00:10:22,705 --> 00:10:24,664
Why not ride the wave? We could have

188
00:10:24,665 --> 00:10:26,333
a full-service restaurantby the end of the year.

189
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:28,502
This place couldn't handlethat kind of volume.

190
00:10:28,544 --> 00:10:31,756
So we build a second story. Or buy the place next door.

191
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:33,674
That sounds a lotlike expanding,

192
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:35,593
and we do not havethe money for that.

193
00:10:35,634 --> 00:10:39,972
We apply for a loan. It'llpay for itself in no time.

194
00:10:40,014 --> 00:10:41,015
What is yourfavorite expression?

195
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:43,184
[Together] Create somethingunique for yourself.

196
00:10:43,225 --> 00:10:45,853
Yes. And right now, you and Faye McArthy

197
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:49,065
are like two sidesof the same coin.

198
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:51,192
Don't you want tobe more than her?

199
00:10:51,233 --> 00:10:54,195
Of course I do. I always do.

200
00:10:54,236 --> 00:10:56,864
Then this is how youtake it to the next level.

201
00:10:56,906 --> 00:10:58,282
I'm sorry Sam,

202
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:01,118
but it's just notfinancially feasible for us.

203
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,203
[Bell ringing]

204
00:11:03,204 --> 00:11:06,248
Well then maybe I need toreconsider my future here

205
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:09,835
because I didn't spend two yearsat the Cordon Bleu in London

206
00:11:09,877 --> 00:11:11,796
to make banana cupcakesand lemon bars

207
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:13,047
for the restof my life.

208
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:14,965
[Bell ringing]

209
00:11:17,718 --> 00:11:22,139
(Lydia) Hello, how are you? How's your day?

210
00:11:45,913 --> 00:11:49,500
Wow. Only17?

211
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:51,043
Great.

212
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:58,426
Hi!

213
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:04,724
Okay, I know that look. What have you heard?

214
00:12:04,765 --> 00:12:07,935
That Faye McArthy broke herfibula or tibia or something.

215
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:11,272
And she has to stay off herfoot for more than a month.

216
00:12:11,313 --> 00:12:16,777
So, Casey McArthy is enteringthe bake-off in her place.

217
00:12:16,819 --> 00:12:18,154
She does the books.

218
00:12:18,195 --> 00:12:20,990
Great. So it'll bean easy win for you.

219
00:12:21,031 --> 00:12:24,951
Actually, it's going tobe an easy win for you.

220
00:12:24,952 --> 00:12:27,787
Uh huh, I'm passingyou the torch, son.

221
00:12:27,788 --> 00:12:29,123
And what if Irefuse the torch?

222
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:31,500
You can't refuse the torch, it's your birthright.

223
00:12:31,542 --> 00:12:33,961
I don't think it is. Look Mom, I really don't

224
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:36,296
want to take on yourfeud with Faye McArthy.

225
00:12:36,297 --> 00:12:38,466
And it's not even Faye, it's her daughter.

226
00:12:38,507 --> 00:12:39,508
Think of the publicity.

227
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:45,431
The Harper-McArthy feudmoves to the next generation.

228
00:12:45,473 --> 00:12:47,433
Plus, it's no funfor me if I don't

229
00:12:47,475 --> 00:12:49,101
get the satisfactionof beating Faye.

230
00:12:49,143 --> 00:12:51,187
Mom, it's apumpkin pie contest.

231
00:12:51,228 --> 00:12:54,147
No, Sam. It is thepumpkin pie contest.

232
00:12:54,148 --> 00:12:55,149
The TV news covers it.

233
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:57,735
The papers. The final roundis featured on the Culinary

234
00:12:57,777 --> 00:12:59,986
Channel show, "PieHeaven." And you know

235
00:12:59,987 --> 00:13:02,198
what happens every timelast year's episode airs.

236
00:13:02,239 --> 00:13:03,490
We run out of pie.

237
00:13:03,491 --> 00:13:07,160
We run out of everything!

238
00:13:07,161 --> 00:13:11,998
Sam, I know we've been havingsome disagreements lately,

239
00:13:11,999 --> 00:13:15,085
but it's important to me.

240
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:18,339
Okay, fine. I'll do it.

241
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:20,341
But then you have todo something for me.

242
00:13:20,382 --> 00:13:21,841
What's that?

243
00:13:21,842 --> 00:13:24,553
I'm going to put togethersome sort of presentation.

244
00:13:24,595 --> 00:13:27,598
A business planfor our restaurant.

245
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,267
And you willconsider it.

246
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:33,604
It's important to me.

247
00:13:37,107 --> 00:13:40,236
Okay, it's a deal.

248
00:13:40,277 --> 00:13:42,571
Great. Now let'stalk pumpkin.

249
00:13:50,371 --> 00:13:53,749
It's important that you wearyour game face at all times.

250
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:57,503
In this competition, theyprey on your weaknesses. Hi!

251
00:13:57,545 --> 00:13:58,504
It's a dog eat dog world

252
00:13:58,754 --> 00:14:01,257
and that is nothingcompared to the bake-off.

253
00:14:01,298 --> 00:14:04,009
Every eye in town willbe on you, watching you.

254
00:14:04,051 --> 00:14:05,344
Be careful what you say.

255
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:06,554
Be careful what you do.

256
00:14:06,595 --> 00:14:08,055
There is no room for error.

257
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:10,599
There is no room for error.

258
00:14:12,393 --> 00:14:13,644
Excuse me.

259
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:16,146
Excuse me.

260
00:14:18,065 --> 00:14:19,525
This is likeThe Hunger Games.

261
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:23,404
I don't know what that means, but I'm sure this is worse.

262
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:27,116
[Crowd applause]

263
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:32,412
Alright, alright. Saveit for the big show.

264
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:35,082
So we all know the rules. There's two rounds of judging:

265
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:37,126
Round one, all 12 contestants will bake

266
00:14:37,167 --> 00:14:39,253
their very own loaf of gourmet pumpkin bread.

267
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:41,880
Our three judges will thenchoose three winners.

268
00:14:41,922 --> 00:14:46,844
For round two, finalists willbake an original pumpkin pie.

269
00:14:46,885 --> 00:14:49,096
We've seen it all before folks, so let's please

270
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:51,598
try and be extra creative this year, alright?

271
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:53,933
What's the best thing toput into a pumpkin pie?

272
00:14:53,934 --> 00:14:56,562
[Everyone together]Your teeth!

273
00:14:56,604 --> 00:15:02,401
Now please form a single fileline at the table to register.

274
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:05,654
Come on, you'llbe fine! Go!

275
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:25,633
Come by the shop!

276
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,345
Case?

277
00:15:29,386 --> 00:15:33,891
Hey. I didn't know I'd begoing up against Sam Harper.

278
00:15:33,932 --> 00:15:37,143
There was nothing that guywasn't good at in high school.

279
00:15:37,144 --> 00:15:38,354
I mean, we weren'tfriends, thanks

280
00:15:38,395 --> 00:15:40,314
to your war withMrs. Harper.

281
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:43,025
That doesn't seem to haveruined your life dear.

282
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:46,236
I guess not, but, he's aprofessional chef.

283
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:48,447
He does all the bakingfor Fuller Street.

284
00:15:48,489 --> 00:15:49,657
I can't compete with that.

285
00:15:49,698 --> 00:15:51,158
Yes you can!

286
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:55,454
And with any luck, mediocrityruns through his Harper veins.

287
00:15:55,496 --> 00:15:59,249
And you've got my bloodrunning through yours.

288
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:01,543
And I'll teach youeverything I know.

289
00:16:01,585 --> 00:16:04,046
No way, Mom. Absolutely not.

290
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:06,507
The doctor saidthat foot has to heal.

291
00:16:06,548 --> 00:16:08,425
And besides, I... I have to learn how

292
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:11,136
to run things on myown sooner or later.

293
00:16:11,178 --> 00:16:14,264
There's Eleanor Field, I've got to go talk to her

294
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:16,350
about her granddaughter'sbirthday cake.

295
00:16:16,934 --> 00:16:20,020
I've got no idea what a "Yo Gabba Gabba" is.

296
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:21,772
Anyway, I'll see youback at the car.

297
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:23,482
Okay.

298
00:16:35,536 --> 00:16:37,037
Hey!

299
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:41,750
Oh! Sam Harper.

300
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:43,085
Casey McArthy.

301
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:44,795
I haven't seen youaround town lately.

302
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:47,881
We McArthys like tokeep a low profile.

303
00:16:47,923 --> 00:16:51,093
Ah, of course. Howelse would you keep

304
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:53,679
your secret recipeshidden from my family?

305
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:56,390
Exactly. So how'sbusiness on your end?

306
00:16:56,432 --> 00:16:57,933
[Laughing]

307
00:16:57,975 --> 00:16:59,309
Wouldn't you love to know?

308
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:02,228
Nope. Just tryingto be cordial.

309
00:17:02,229 --> 00:17:05,231
Ours is killingit, by the way.

310
00:17:05,232 --> 00:17:07,026
The fact that you feelthe need to tell me that,

311
00:17:07,067 --> 00:17:08,861
makes it sound alittle questionable.

312
00:17:08,902 --> 00:17:10,612
Feel free to thinkwhat you want.

313
00:17:10,654 --> 00:17:12,948
I wouldn't want to burdenyou with actual facts.

314
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:16,535
So... are you ready? Thisthing could get ugly, you know.

315
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:17,910
Of course it will.

316
00:17:17,911 --> 00:17:20,789
It's the world famousbake-off, after all.

317
00:17:20,831 --> 00:17:23,000
But seriously Casey, you don't actually think

318
00:17:23,041 --> 00:17:24,835
you can beat me, do you? I mean...

319
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:26,919
I've been doing thisthing since high school.

320
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:30,132
Okay sure, maybe I don'thave your culinary training

321
00:17:30,174 --> 00:17:31,925
and all your yearsin the kitchen,

322
00:17:31,967 --> 00:17:34,970
but where I come from, we're taught to think

323
00:17:35,012 --> 00:17:37,765
outside the box. And fortunate for me,

324
00:17:37,806 --> 00:17:40,017
outside the box iswhere I live and breathe.

325
00:17:40,058 --> 00:17:41,351
You're prettyconfident aren't you?

326
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:44,063
That's right, and I can'twait to see your face

327
00:17:44,104 --> 00:17:46,231
when this rookietakes first place

328
00:17:46,273 --> 00:17:48,275
in front of theentire town.

329
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:50,027
Game on, Miss McArthy.

330
00:17:50,068 --> 00:17:52,446
Game on Mr. Harper.

331
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:15,344
Casey!

332
00:18:15,385 --> 00:18:17,304
I said mix the batter.

333
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:18,305
That's what I'm doing.

334
00:18:18,306 --> 00:18:23,018
No, a spoon stirs, a mixer mixes.

335
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:25,354
Oh. Well, youdidn't say that.

336
00:18:25,395 --> 00:18:28,147
I thought it was a given. You did grow up in a bakery.

337
00:18:28,148 --> 00:18:30,817
Yes, and I've watched you dothis a million times,

338
00:18:30,818 --> 00:18:32,778
so can youplease go home now?

339
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:34,238
I have to practiceand I don't need

340
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:36,740
to worry about youhobbling around here.

341
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:39,159
Oh, I forgot, yoursister is coming to town

342
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:41,160
early to help usout with the festival.

343
00:18:41,161 --> 00:18:41,995
Great!

344
00:18:42,204 --> 00:18:43,329
Do you want to cometo the house early

345
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:47,876
tonight just todiscuss strategy?

346
00:18:47,918 --> 00:18:50,087
For your pitch meetingwith The Buckeye Hotel?

347
00:18:50,128 --> 00:18:52,256
Yes! Now, can youplease go home?

348
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:53,006
Dad's beenwaiting for you

349
00:18:53,257 --> 00:18:54,842
in the car forthe last 15 minutes.

350
00:18:54,883 --> 00:18:58,262
Just, keep practicing! You'll be okay.

351
00:19:18,532 --> 00:19:21,451
Hey Mom, can you call me whenyou get this?

352
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:23,829
It says I need abaking pumpkin

353
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:25,247
and I don't knowwhat that means.

354
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:30,460
They all look thesame to me. Okay, bye.

355
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:33,463
Isn't a pumpkinjust a pumpkin?

356
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:36,258
Actually, no, it's not.

357
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,843
I'm surprised youdidn't learn that at the

358
00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:40,137
bakery you runwith your mother?

359
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:42,389
As you know, I tend to thebusiness side of things.

360
00:19:42,431 --> 00:19:45,642
She bakes. It's aperfect partnership.

361
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:48,353
But you're the one entering thebake-off,

362
00:19:48,395 --> 00:19:49,521
and you don't knowthe difference between

363
00:19:49,563 --> 00:19:51,564
a carving pumpkinand a baking pumpkin?

364
00:19:51,565 --> 00:19:55,819
I do. I own a bakery.

365
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:59,990
It's just that myspecialties lie elsewhere.

366
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:02,408
Like on a spreadsheet?

367
00:20:02,409 --> 00:20:05,077
I have manyother talents...

368
00:20:05,078 --> 00:20:06,038
I'm listening.

369
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:08,457
You think I'm just goingto show you all my cards?

370
00:20:08,498 --> 00:20:10,417
What? You think you'reholding a royal flush?

371
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:12,669
I just might be. So I suggest you

372
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:15,714
fold now to avoidembarrassment.

373
00:20:15,756 --> 00:20:18,550
I never fold.

374
00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:21,011
Oh, this is good, we're just...

375
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:24,306
carrying on an age-oldfamily tradition.

376
00:20:24,348 --> 00:20:26,308
Harpers vs. McArthys.

377
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:27,267
It's heartwarming, isn't it?

378
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:29,394
Yeah I can't wait tosee how it plays out.

379
00:20:29,436 --> 00:20:31,396
Ditto.

380
00:20:31,939 --> 00:20:34,149
Good luck findingyour baking pumpkin.

381
00:20:34,191 --> 00:20:38,695
Trust me, luck hasnothing to do with it.

382
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:44,534
So, what's abaking pumpkin?

383
00:20:48,622 --> 00:20:52,000
Maple scones, oh and croissants.

384
00:20:52,042 --> 00:20:54,127
Every hotel hascroissants for breakfast.

385
00:20:54,169 --> 00:20:57,005
I'll have it all ready for mymeeting with them on Wednesday.

386
00:20:57,047 --> 00:20:59,298
And stop worrying, I'llknock it out of the park.

387
00:20:59,299 --> 00:21:01,093
Okay, okay.

388
00:21:01,134 --> 00:21:04,388
See? I can handle thebusiness and the contest.

389
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:06,056
I can't believeSam Harper thinks I

390
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:08,225
don't know what I'mdoing in the kitchen.

391
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:11,353
Honey, you don't know whatyou're doing in the kitchen.

392
00:21:11,395 --> 00:21:16,066
Yeah, but hedoesn't know that.

393
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:20,988
Just be careful okay? I knowhe's cute and charming,

394
00:21:21,029 --> 00:21:23,448
but he is his mother's son,

395
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:26,285
and she's a snakein the grass.

396
00:21:26,326 --> 00:21:29,246
Mom, I have a businessdegree from Wharton.

397
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:32,331
We had entire classeson psychological warfare.

398
00:21:32,332 --> 00:21:35,501
I think I can handlethe likes of Sam Harper.

399
00:21:35,502 --> 00:21:38,004
Besides, this isour family business,

400
00:21:38,005 --> 00:21:40,090
and nothing is moreimportant to me.

401
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:42,384
That's my girl.

402
00:21:54,604 --> 00:21:57,566
And... print.

403
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:04,530
For the first round, I will be making

404
00:22:04,531 --> 00:22:08,076
my mother's classicpumpkin bread.

405
00:22:12,706 --> 00:22:16,293
That tastes like cement.

[Alarm ringing]

407
00:22:20,547 --> 00:22:23,633
Oh, no no no. Not again!

[Coughing]

409
00:22:33,518 --> 00:22:36,646

[Coughing]

411
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:45,697
Hello? Hello?

[Fire extinguisher spraying]

413
00:22:56,708 --> 00:22:58,627
I see you found yourselfa baking pumpkin.

414
00:22:58,668 --> 00:23:01,213

[Fire truck sirens]

416
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:07,760
Yes Captain, there willnot be a third time.

417
00:23:07,761 --> 00:23:09,262
Please, take thisback to the guys

418
00:23:09,304 --> 00:23:12,391
at the station. On the house.

419
00:23:12,432 --> 00:23:15,268
You're doing great work.

420
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:19,438
So, now you know.

421
00:23:19,439 --> 00:23:21,942
I'm a completedisaster in the kitchen.

422
00:23:21,983 --> 00:23:24,694
Uh... I just want tomake sure you're okay.

423
00:23:24,736 --> 00:23:27,697
I'm fine, thebakery is fine.

424
00:23:27,739 --> 00:23:29,991
And as much as itmight disappoint you,

425
00:23:30,033 --> 00:23:32,077
we will live tosee another day.

426
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:33,662
Contrary to what youmight think of my family,

427
00:23:33,703 --> 00:23:35,539
we really don'twant anything bad

428
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:36,456
to happen toyour business.

429
00:23:36,665 --> 00:23:38,375
In fact, it's nicehaving the competition.

430
00:23:38,416 --> 00:23:40,085
It keeps us on our toes.

431
00:23:40,127 --> 00:23:42,337
To be honest with you I'meven, sort of, looking

432
00:23:42,379 --> 00:23:45,464
to get out of the bakerybusiness altogether.

433
00:23:45,465 --> 00:23:47,259
Really?

434
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:48,801
And do what?

435
00:23:48,802 --> 00:23:51,388
A full-service sit downrestaurant.

436
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:52,597
That would servea family-friendly,

437
00:23:52,639 --> 00:23:56,475
American classic cuisinewith a gourmet flair.

438
00:23:56,476 --> 00:23:58,395
The Fuller Streetrestaurant.

439
00:23:58,436 --> 00:24:00,230
It would just take afew renovations.

440
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:03,358
A new space, maybe. I don't know.

441
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,484
So what's the hold up?

442
00:24:05,485 --> 00:24:07,153
My mother, of course.

443
00:24:07,154 --> 00:24:09,197
I want her to think bigger, but she's so concerned

444
00:24:09,239 --> 00:24:11,824
about the time, theenergy, the money.

445
00:24:11,825 --> 00:24:13,325
But more thananything I think

446
00:24:13,326 --> 00:24:15,162
her whole life isfocused on the bakery.

447
00:24:15,203 --> 00:24:17,496
I guess she worries a restaurantmight interfere with it.

448
00:24:17,497 --> 00:24:20,292
Well, I hope youcan convince her.

449
00:24:20,333 --> 00:24:22,419
That way, peoplewould only come here

450
00:24:22,461 --> 00:24:25,463
for pastries and allmy problems would be solved.

451
00:24:25,505 --> 00:24:28,300
So things aren'tgoing so...

452
00:24:28,341 --> 00:24:29,675
We're getting by.

453
00:24:29,676 --> 00:24:31,052
We've been thereas well.

454
00:24:31,094 --> 00:24:33,555
But I want to do morethan just get by.

455
00:24:33,597 --> 00:24:36,725
My mother and I havean agreement of sorts.

456
00:24:36,766 --> 00:24:40,395
I win the contest and she'llconsider the proposal.

457
00:24:40,437 --> 00:24:42,188
What kind of proposal?

458
00:24:42,189 --> 00:24:44,274
Right now, it's just amenu for the restaurant.

459
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:46,359
But I'm workingon a business plan,

460
00:24:46,401 --> 00:24:49,154
which is takinga little longer.

461
00:24:49,196 --> 00:24:51,530
The most important thingl learned at Wharton

462
00:24:51,531 --> 00:24:54,326
was the differencebetween an idea and a plan.

463
00:24:54,367 --> 00:24:58,038
Dreamers have ideas, and doers have plans.

464
00:24:58,079 --> 00:25:00,165
The best advice Ican give you is...

465
00:25:00,207 --> 00:25:03,919
Map out every last detail, from start to finish.

466
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:06,254
Thanks, I'll do that.

467
00:25:06,296 --> 00:25:07,214
So what about you?

468
00:25:07,464 --> 00:25:10,717
What's your recipe forthe preliminary round?

469
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:13,553
An idea or a plan?

470
00:25:13,595 --> 00:25:16,723
Well, first it was anidea, then it was a plan.

471
00:25:16,765 --> 00:25:19,601
And now, it's borderingon a colossal failure.

472
00:25:19,643 --> 00:25:22,394
Look at us... what a pair.

473
00:25:22,395 --> 00:25:24,564
Yeah.

474
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:28,610
Wait a minute! I got it!

475
00:25:28,652 --> 00:25:30,779
You need a viablebusiness proposal,

476
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:32,614
something I cando in my sleep,

477
00:25:32,656 --> 00:25:34,366
and with my motherout of commission,

478
00:25:34,407 --> 00:25:37,244
I need someone toteach me how to bake...

479
00:25:37,285 --> 00:25:39,538
without burningdown the town.

480
00:25:39,579 --> 00:25:41,747
You want me tohelp you win?

481
00:25:41,748 --> 00:25:47,546
No, just help each otherget what we both want.

482
00:25:47,587 --> 00:25:50,298
Did I mentioned Iwas top of my class?

483
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:51,758
Do you know howmany job offers

484
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:54,052
I hadafter graduation?

485
00:25:54,094 --> 00:25:56,429
This feels a lot likeconspiring with the enemy.

486
00:25:56,471 --> 00:25:58,557
I won't tell if you don't.

487
00:25:59,724 --> 00:26:03,061
Alright, you've gotyourself a teacher.

488
00:26:11,069 --> 00:26:15,365
So ten o'clock tonight. Text me first to make sure I'm alone.

489
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:17,950
My mother is failing miserably at staying off her feet.

490
00:26:17,951 --> 00:26:18,910
Got it.

491
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:21,121
We have to be so careful, Sam. I don't know about

492
00:26:21,162 --> 00:26:23,248
your mother, but mine willpractically disown me if

493
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:25,624
she has any idea that we'rehelping each other out.

494
00:26:25,625 --> 00:26:28,420
Oh, trust me, mymother would as well.

495
00:26:28,461 --> 00:26:30,630
Okay, I'll see you at 10.

496
00:26:34,551 --> 00:26:37,470
Auntie Casey!

497
00:26:37,512 --> 00:26:40,515
Alisa, you're here!

498
00:26:40,557 --> 00:26:41,516
Oh I missed you!

499
00:26:41,558 --> 00:26:43,475
I missed you too!

500
00:26:43,476 --> 00:26:44,477
Hi!

501
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:46,271
Hi big sister!

502
00:26:46,313 --> 00:26:48,732
And you'rehere... again!

503
00:26:48,773 --> 00:26:52,818
What? The baker fillingin for me called with

504
00:26:52,819 --> 00:26:54,946
some questions, so I hadBetty drive me over.

505
00:26:54,988 --> 00:26:56,990
She insisted. Andl was just home,

506
00:26:57,032 --> 00:26:59,534
working on mybake-off recipe.

507
00:26:59,576 --> 00:27:02,120
I just might have a shotthis year with Faye and

508
00:27:02,162 --> 00:27:04,581
Lydia out of the mix. Between those two, no one

509
00:27:04,623 --> 00:27:07,250
else has won that contestin well over a decade.

510
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:09,210
Well, that definitelychanges this year.

511
00:27:09,252 --> 00:27:11,963
Maybe we can get some otherthings to change this year too.

512
00:27:12,005 --> 00:27:12,631
Oh...

513
00:27:12,839 --> 00:27:14,840
It's no use, Betty. I've tried.

514
00:27:14,841 --> 00:27:17,260
They're the Hatfieldsand McCoys of Emeryville.

515
00:27:17,302 --> 00:27:19,637
Is it too much to askto want to have my

516
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:20,972
good friends backtogether again?

517
00:27:21,014 --> 00:27:22,223
Yes!

518
00:27:22,265 --> 00:27:24,516
And you know verywell, Mother, that you

519
00:27:24,517 --> 00:27:26,895
can answer questionsover the phone.

520
00:27:26,936 --> 00:27:28,354
I'm so bored at home.

521
00:27:28,355 --> 00:27:29,731
Why can't Icome in and help?

522
00:27:29,773 --> 00:27:31,483
Because the doctor saidif you keep standing

523
00:27:31,524 --> 00:27:34,736
on that foot you mighthave permanent damage!

524
00:27:34,778 --> 00:27:38,073
That's why. Now go home!

525
00:27:39,282 --> 00:27:41,743
Alright, fine. I knowwhen I'm not wanted.

526
00:27:41,785 --> 00:27:43,495
Muah! Bye, Lexi.

527
00:27:43,536 --> 00:27:44,913
[Laughing]Bye!

528
00:27:44,954 --> 00:27:45,830
Bye honey.

529
00:27:45,872 --> 00:27:47,791
Bye.

530
00:27:47,832 --> 00:27:50,752
So, I have taken the weekoff work, I am all yours.

531
00:27:50,794 --> 00:27:53,338
Although I may have to do alittle work while I'm here

532
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:55,465
because I have a big casecoming up next month.

533
00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:57,383
Thank you so much. You have no idea

534
00:27:57,384 --> 00:27:58,676
how much I needyou this week.

535
00:27:58,718 --> 00:28:01,721
Are you kidding? You andSam Harper taking over

536
00:28:01,763 --> 00:28:04,682
the family feud? I would notmiss this for the world!

537
00:28:04,724 --> 00:28:07,726
We're not "taking it over." Wejust both happened to enter the

538
00:28:07,727 --> 00:28:09,896
bake-off for the first timethis year. That's all.

539
00:28:09,938 --> 00:28:12,732
But mom says if you win thisyou're going to get featured

540
00:28:12,774 --> 00:28:15,902
on that Culinary show, "PieHeaven". That's pretty cool.

541
00:28:15,944 --> 00:28:18,655
Don't set yourDVR quite yet,

542
00:28:18,696 --> 00:28:21,700
I'm a long way offfrom winning anything.

543
00:28:21,741 --> 00:28:24,452
Oh Casey, you do so muchfor this place. You know

544
00:28:24,494 --> 00:28:27,705
you don't have to take onthis contest on as well.

545
00:28:27,747 --> 00:28:29,581
You remember after Igraduated I could have

546
00:28:29,582 --> 00:28:32,627
moved away to work at thatbig company in New York?

547
00:28:32,669 --> 00:28:38,883
I had a choice, but mom neededme, so the choice was easy.

548
00:28:38,925 --> 00:28:42,929
I guess deep down Ireally do love this place,

549
00:28:42,971 --> 00:28:44,556
and it's forthat very reason

550
00:28:44,597 --> 00:28:47,766
I do need to takethis contest on.

551
00:28:47,767 --> 00:28:49,477
Okay.

552
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:50,687
I'm glad you're here.

553
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:52,439
I wish you a lot of luck.

554
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,440
Mom's driving me crazy!

555
00:28:54,441 --> 00:28:55,900
I believe it.

556
00:29:09,497 --> 00:29:11,458
Now stir it in with the cinnamon, nutmeg,

557
00:29:11,499 --> 00:29:13,793
cloves, and ginger. We'll do each mix

558
00:29:13,835 --> 00:29:16,337
separately and thenblend them together.

559
00:29:16,379 --> 00:29:20,467
Okay. Got it. I think.

560
00:29:21,634 --> 00:29:25,013
"Cooking should be entered intowith abandon, or not at all."

561
00:29:25,054 --> 00:29:26,973
Julia Child said that.

562
00:29:27,015 --> 00:29:29,017
"If you're not goingto take it seriously,

563
00:29:29,058 --> 00:29:33,312
get out of the kitchen."Faye McArthy said that.

564
00:29:33,313 --> 00:29:35,190
So how is it yougrew up in a

565
00:29:35,231 --> 00:29:36,357
bakery and neverlearned to cook?

566
00:29:36,483 --> 00:29:38,026
I've always had moreof a propensity towards

567
00:29:38,067 --> 00:29:41,112
business and academics. That's why I'm the brains

568
00:29:41,154 --> 00:29:43,740
of The Sweet Factory andmy mother is the brawn.

569
00:29:43,781 --> 00:29:47,659
Okay Miss Academic, try this. Treat the recipe like an

570
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:51,956
equation. Follow the steps andit won't steer you wrong.

571
00:29:51,998 --> 00:29:58,170
Actually I think cooking is moreof an art form. And art and I...

572
00:29:58,171 --> 00:30:01,340
we've always had thislove/hate sort of thing.

573
00:30:01,341 --> 00:30:07,179
It just takes practice. You'll get it. Now, stir!

574
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:10,350
But you on the other hand... Thestar quarterback who went to

575
00:30:10,391 --> 00:30:12,519
work for your mom rightafter high school.

576
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:14,979
Went off to culinaryschool in France...

577
00:30:15,021 --> 00:30:20,318
Almost to 350 degrees. Let's mix the pumpkin.

578
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:23,362
So how did you know thiswas what you wanted to do?

579
00:30:23,363 --> 00:30:25,865
My grandma used to say:"you want to show someone

580
00:30:25,907 --> 00:30:29,953
you care? Cook for them."So that's what I do.

581
00:30:29,994 --> 00:30:31,412
Sometimes a plateof chocolate chip

582
00:30:31,454 --> 00:30:32,830
cookies is allyou really need.

583
00:30:32,872 --> 00:30:35,040
And while the bakery hasbeen great, it's time for a

584
00:30:35,041 --> 00:30:37,418
restaurant. Something withcommunity tables, where

585
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:42,047
it's loud and busy and foodis served family style.

586
00:30:42,048 --> 00:30:44,926
Now, that is the perfect wayto mix if you want your bread

587
00:30:44,968 --> 00:30:48,053
to be clumpy and uneven. Is thatthe texture you're going for?

588
00:30:48,054 --> 00:30:53,559
Of course, who doesn'tlike clumpy bread.

589
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:56,980
Okay, you go ahead, show me the right way.

590
00:30:58,064 --> 00:30:59,148
Use this.

591
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:01,192
Okay.

592
00:31:01,234 --> 00:31:04,737
Uh... in a circle, like this.

593
00:31:06,489 --> 00:31:10,118
Look at that. Nota single clump.

594
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:11,077
Yeah.

595
00:31:11,078 --> 00:31:12,620
I'm a prettygood teacher.

596
00:31:12,662 --> 00:31:14,831
For a Harper.

597
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:18,376
Hopefully, nottoo good, though.

598
00:31:18,418 --> 00:31:21,129
So when are we going to talkabout my business plan?

599
00:31:21,170 --> 00:31:23,922
Tomorrow night. I promise.

600
00:31:23,923 --> 00:31:27,510
Now let's call it anight before I collapse.

601
00:31:51,868 --> 00:31:54,871
Mmm. Somethingsmells great!

602
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:55,954
Hey!

603
00:31:55,955 --> 00:31:57,915
Hey, you ready forthe big meeting?

604
00:31:57,957 --> 00:32:00,792
Let me guess, she sentyou here to spy on me?

605
00:32:00,793 --> 00:32:05,464
Actually no. I'm about toplay 18 holes of golf,

606
00:32:05,465 --> 00:32:10,762
and I need some snacksfor... uh for the guys.

607
00:32:13,681 --> 00:32:15,433
Don't tell your mother, but Lydia's white

608
00:32:15,475 --> 00:32:18,144
chocolate macadamia nutcookies are better.

609
00:32:18,186 --> 00:32:20,104
Bite your tongue, Dad.

610
00:32:20,146 --> 00:32:21,856
Shhhh.

611
00:32:21,898 --> 00:32:25,193
Knock ´em deadtoday, Case.

612
00:32:39,874 --> 00:32:42,794
[Cell phone ringing]

613
00:32:42,835 --> 00:32:44,754
I told you I'd callyou when I was done.

614
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:45,837
Just tell me!

615
00:32:45,838 --> 00:32:47,131
It went well. Theyloved everything.

616
00:32:47,173 --> 00:32:49,050
Especially yourpumpkin scones.

617
00:32:49,092 --> 00:32:50,969
Of course! Did you tellthem about all the

618
00:32:51,010 --> 00:32:53,596
different flavors weoffer seasonally?

619
00:32:53,638 --> 00:32:55,807
This is not my firstrodeo, Mom. I told

620
00:32:55,848 --> 00:32:57,516
them everything wediscussed and there was

621
00:32:57,517 --> 00:33:00,186
not a single uneatenpastry at the table.

622
00:33:00,228 --> 00:33:02,939
Yes! Great! So, what's next?

623
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:04,607
They're talking to afew other people but

624
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:06,901
I feel like we have areally good shot.

625
00:33:06,943 --> 00:33:08,820
That's wonderful Casey.

626
00:33:08,861 --> 00:33:12,615
You have nothing to worryabout. I've got this.

627
00:33:20,707 --> 00:33:23,209
[Cell phone notification]

628
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:32,969
[Bell ringing]

629
00:33:33,761 --> 00:33:35,638
That was fast...

630
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:36,723
What was fast?

631
00:33:37,056 --> 00:33:41,436
Oh, hi. Sorry, I was talking tomyself. What are you doing here?

632
00:33:41,477 --> 00:33:43,730
I thought you were going to Momand Dad's to do your work?

633
00:33:43,771 --> 00:33:46,023
I've been going over thesedepositions for hours.

634
00:33:46,065 --> 00:33:49,068
My eyes are starting to glazeover. I need a sugar fix.

635
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:52,697
Okay, yeah. I'll put somein a to-go box for you.

636
00:33:52,739 --> 00:33:53,698
Red velvet cupcakes okay?

637
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:54,949
Yeah!

638
00:33:54,991 --> 00:33:57,118
Gosh Casey, you'vebeen working so hard!

639
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,870
Why don't you gohome, I can close up.

640
00:33:58,911 --> 00:34:00,621
No!

641
00:34:00,663 --> 00:34:05,001
No, I... I have another practicerun in the oven and... maybe

642
00:34:05,042 --> 00:34:08,587
this one will be successful. I'll keep you posted.

643
00:34:08,588 --> 00:34:10,589
You don't have toprove yourself to me.

644
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:13,301
You know I'm way worseat this than you are.

645
00:34:19,932 --> 00:34:21,267
Was that Sam Harper?

646
00:34:21,309 --> 00:34:24,270
What? Where?

647
00:34:24,312 --> 00:34:26,647
He just tried towalk in here!

648
00:34:26,689 --> 00:34:30,568
No, really? Are you sure? Are you sure it was him?

649
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:31,986
I don't know.

650
00:34:32,904 --> 00:34:35,698
I don't know.

651
00:34:39,869 --> 00:34:41,953
Sorry about thatearlier. I couldn't

652
00:34:41,954 --> 00:34:43,581
get my sisterout of here.

653
00:34:43,623 --> 00:34:47,210
It's ok, I had to catch up onmy window shopping anyway.

654
00:34:47,251 --> 00:34:49,712
So... where were we? Construction and

655
00:34:49,754 --> 00:34:52,798
renovation estimate here. Monthly rent increase.

656
00:34:52,799 --> 00:34:56,219
Operating expenses, staff, insurance, etc.

657
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:58,930
Wow. You've thoughtof everything.

658
00:34:58,971 --> 00:35:02,141
This is the differencebetween an idea and a plan.

659
00:35:02,183 --> 00:35:05,645
You're really good at this. So tell me, have you...

660
00:35:05,686 --> 00:35:08,647
ever been tempted to call thatcompany back in New York?

661
00:35:08,648 --> 00:35:13,778
Maybe once, after somesilly argument with my mom.

662
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:16,572
But then I realized how much I love it here.

663
00:35:16,614 --> 00:35:20,785
I grew up in this place. Someday my kids are going

664
00:35:20,827 --> 00:35:25,998
to be here, doing theirhomework, eating donuts.

665
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:27,999
This is home.

666
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,045
I know the feeling.

667
00:35:31,087 --> 00:35:34,674
But hopefully this puts youone step closer to your dream.

668
00:35:34,715 --> 00:35:38,010
I mean, after I win tomorrow, you're going to need to take

669
00:35:38,052 --> 00:35:41,973
things in a new direction. Afallback plan, so to speak.

670
00:35:42,014 --> 00:35:44,892
I wouldn't be so sure ofyourself, McArthy.

671
00:35:44,934 --> 00:35:47,853
You still haven't seenmy recipe for prelims.

672
00:35:47,854 --> 00:35:51,189
I haven't, but I had a prettygood practice run today,

673
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:53,191
so you'd betterbring your "A game".

674
00:35:53,192 --> 00:35:56,237
All I have is an "A game," McArthy.

675
00:35:56,279 --> 00:35:58,196
Well, then I'll justsay, "good luck."

676
00:35:58,197 --> 00:36:00,699
And to you. Andmay the best man-

677
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:02,118
Or woman... AHHHH!

678
00:36:02,159 --> 00:36:04,954
Or woman... Win.

679
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:15,798
Please. Afteryou. Please

680
00:36:30,646 --> 00:36:33,316
Alright, preliminaryround. How are we feeling?

681
00:36:33,357 --> 00:36:36,193
I'm nervous. Whatif I mess up?

682
00:36:36,235 --> 00:36:39,447
Okay, listen. Yourbig sister is about to

683
00:36:39,488 --> 00:36:42,867
give you some very sound, unsolicited advice.

684
00:36:42,909 --> 00:36:45,286
When I first startedcollege, what was my major?

685
00:36:45,328 --> 00:36:47,078
Pre-med, but if Iremember correctly,

686
00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:49,123
the sight of bloodmade you faint.

687
00:36:49,165 --> 00:36:54,921
Every single time. In theory, I loved medicine, in practice,

688
00:36:54,962 --> 00:36:57,798
it made me unconscious. So I changed course.

689
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:58,925
Yeah, to law.

690
00:36:59,258 --> 00:37:03,137
Exactly. It just spoke to me. And then I ended up loving it.

691
00:37:03,179 --> 00:37:05,181
You need to findwhat speaks to you.

692
00:37:05,222 --> 00:37:08,934
Yeah, but I already know. It's this place. The bakery.

693
00:37:08,935 --> 00:37:12,103
That's what speaks to me and Ijust want to do right by it.

694
00:37:12,104 --> 00:37:18,069
Then let that fuel you, and letgo! Have a little fun with it.

695
00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:20,404
Wait, cooking issupposed to be fun?

696
00:37:20,446 --> 00:37:22,156
Yeah!

697
00:37:22,198 --> 00:37:24,450
Why didn't anybodytell me that?

698
00:37:35,211 --> 00:37:37,505
Casey!

699
00:37:37,546 --> 00:37:39,674
Thanks, again, for helpingme out. I went over it

700
00:37:39,715 --> 00:37:43,468
in detail last night. Business plan is incredible.

701
00:37:43,469 --> 00:37:45,763
Well, just don't tellanyone where you got it.

702
00:37:45,805 --> 00:37:47,431
Your secret'ssafe with me.

703
00:37:47,473 --> 00:37:50,518
More importantly, how are you feeling?

704
00:37:50,559 --> 00:37:52,979

00:47:19,002 --> 00:47:21,546
sense of the word. Little dothey know, it was you that

883
00:47:21,547 --> 00:47:25,717
helped me into finals. Well, you and my mother's recipe.

884
00:47:25,759 --> 00:47:29,930
You got you to finals. I was just the coach.

885
00:47:29,972 --> 00:47:32,516
Does that mean you're not doneyet? Because right now I only

886
00:47:32,558 --> 00:47:36,103
know how to make one dish, and it's not a pumpkin pie.

887
00:47:36,144 --> 00:47:38,188
As far as I can seeit, we can either

888
00:47:38,230 --> 00:47:40,482
help each other orhurt each other.

889
00:47:40,524 --> 00:47:42,985
Okay. I can helpyou do a five year

890
00:47:43,026 --> 00:47:46,238
projection plan to furtherentice your mother.

891
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:48,574
Tomorrow night atten at the bakery?

892
00:47:48,615 --> 00:47:49,783
I'll bring the wine?

893
00:47:49,825 --> 00:47:54,412
It's a date!..I mean... lesson.

894
00:47:54,413 --> 00:47:55,789
Let's go.

895
00:48:01,670 --> 00:48:03,422
I said Jake, you have to go to bed,

896
00:48:03,463 --> 00:48:07,426
You know what night this is right? And he goes "Yeah."

897
00:48:07,467 --> 00:48:08,677
[Laughing]

898
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:12,139
Casey! Betty was just tellingme the funniest story

899
00:48:12,180 --> 00:48:14,765
about her son, Jake. You remember Jake?

900
00:48:14,766 --> 00:48:15,726
Yeah!

901
00:48:15,767 --> 00:48:17,935
He's single...

902
00:48:17,936 --> 00:48:19,563
and he has a boat.

903
00:48:19,605 --> 00:48:21,315
Oh, that's great for him.

904
00:48:21,356 --> 00:48:24,192
Why don't you take the nightoff honey, Your sister and I can

905
00:48:24,234 --> 00:48:29,156
close. You've been working sohard, you need to take a break.

906
00:48:29,197 --> 00:48:33,785
Oh, yeah! That sounds...

907
00:48:33,827 --> 00:48:35,913
I'd love a night off.

908
00:48:39,625 --> 00:48:42,669
You're so lucky to have eachother. And this wonderful

909
00:48:42,711 --> 00:48:48,717
business. My kids... well, Idon't hear from them much.

910
00:48:48,759 --> 00:48:51,428
I'm so blessedthese days...

911
00:49:09,363 --> 00:49:11,322
Did somebody order somepumpkin moon pies?

912
00:49:11,323 --> 00:49:13,742
Hey! You read my mind.

913
00:49:13,784 --> 00:49:15,369
It's my superpower.

914
00:49:15,410 --> 00:49:18,664
Not to mention Mom told meto drop them by on my way home.

915
00:49:18,705 --> 00:49:20,666
You want to stay fordinner? I could uh...

916
00:49:20,707 --> 00:49:23,501
microwave somethingmarginally edible.

917
00:49:23,502 --> 00:49:27,171
While that does sound enticing, No, I can't I have go home

918
00:49:27,172 --> 00:49:31,093
and practice my pie recipe. Ithink I'll be at it all night.

919
00:49:31,134 --> 00:49:32,177
Are you using yourmother's recipes?

920
00:49:32,469 --> 00:49:35,347
No! I came up with one ofmy own. Want to hear it?

921
00:49:35,389 --> 00:49:36,390
Yeah.

922
00:49:36,682 --> 00:49:39,517
Pumpkin silk chiffon pie, with bourbon whipped cream.

923
00:49:39,518 --> 00:49:42,229
I can't waitto try that!

924
00:49:42,270 --> 00:49:44,773
Um... did you runit by your mom?

925
00:49:44,815 --> 00:49:46,817
No, I sort of wantto surprise her.

926
00:49:46,858 --> 00:49:50,195
I want to show her thatl can do this on my own.

927
00:49:50,237 --> 00:49:53,240
She's so incredible inthe kitchen and, if this

928
00:49:53,281 --> 00:49:55,826
is my business too, thenl want her to know I can

929
00:49:55,867 --> 00:49:58,202
cover for her if sheever needs me to.

930
00:49:58,203 --> 00:50:00,539
I have to tell you honey, I'm really proud of you.

931
00:50:00,580 --> 00:50:03,166
Making it all the wayto the final round.

932
00:50:03,208 --> 00:50:06,461
Well, I haven't made a pieyet so don't be too proud.

933
00:50:06,503 --> 00:50:08,422
I'm still a workin progress.

934
00:50:08,463 --> 00:50:13,718
And getting every minute. Now go make that pie!

935
00:50:13,719 --> 00:50:14,845
And save me a piece.

936
00:50:14,886 --> 00:50:16,554
I will. I love you, Dad.

937
00:50:16,555 --> 00:50:18,849
Love you too!

938
00:50:26,857 --> 00:50:28,567
This would beyear five year?

939
00:50:28,608 --> 00:50:30,401
Yes, and I would beconservative and

940
00:50:30,402 --> 00:50:33,572
estimate an 8-10 percentgrowth, year over year.

941
00:50:33,613 --> 00:50:37,576
Then, minus the yearlyoperating expenses.

[Typing]

943
00:50:43,957 --> 00:50:45,750
Makes a nice profit. Look at that.

944
00:50:45,751 --> 00:50:50,254
You got it! You just createda five year projection plan.

945
00:50:50,255 --> 00:50:52,466
It's not complicated, just follow

946
00:50:52,507 --> 00:50:55,594
the formula and itnever fails you.

947
00:50:55,635 --> 00:50:58,638
You really light upwhen you talk numbers.

948
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:02,433
It's my language. No mistakes.

949
00:51:02,434 --> 00:51:08,273
True. But mistakes are notalways a bad thing. Sometimes

950
00:51:08,315 --> 00:51:14,154
they lead us to what we'vebeen looking for all along.

951
00:51:15,864 --> 00:51:20,618
It's how I came up with my friedmac and goat cheese appetizer,

952
00:51:20,619 --> 00:51:24,288
and now It's going to be thesignature dish on my menu.

953
00:51:24,289 --> 00:51:27,626
Now that sounds delicious.

954
00:51:27,667 --> 00:51:30,754
You have no idea.

[Oven timer dinging]

956
00:51:37,844 --> 00:51:43,099
And that would mean your veryfirst pie crust is ready.

957
00:51:59,908 --> 00:52:01,868
This is supposed tobe solid, right?

958
00:52:01,910 --> 00:52:03,829
Did you put enoughshortening?

959
00:52:03,870 --> 00:52:05,580
I think so?

960
00:52:05,622 --> 00:52:07,249
No worries, let'stry it again.

961
00:52:07,290 --> 00:52:10,794
Just take your timeand follow the steps.

962
00:52:10,836 --> 00:52:15,090
I don't know Sam, some peoplearen't cut out for this.

963
00:52:15,132 --> 00:52:17,508
Those people don'town a bakery.

964
00:52:17,509 --> 00:52:20,512
Listen to me, you've got mybusiness plan in great shape,

965
00:52:20,554 --> 00:52:23,181
so I owe you and we arenot leaving here until

966
00:52:23,223 --> 00:52:27,852
you make a solid pie crust. Even if it takes all night.

967

[Laughing]

968
00:52:31,648 --> 00:52:33,024
Deal.

969
00:52:33,066 --> 00:52:34,818
Round two.

970
00:52:42,492 --> 00:52:43,868
I didn't realizewhat time it was.

971
00:52:43,869 --> 00:52:47,164
I need to get startedon the morning baking.

972
00:52:50,959 --> 00:52:52,711
Thanks for notgiving up on me.

973
00:52:52,752 --> 00:52:56,380
No, thank you. I feel likel'm one step closer to

974
00:52:56,381 --> 00:52:59,926
not being my mother'semployee anymore.

975
00:53:01,636 --> 00:53:03,013

Casey?

980
00:53:11,062 --> 00:53:11,980
Dad!

981
00:53:12,022 --> 00:53:13,982
Sam!

982
00:53:17,402 --> 00:53:20,739
...and I wasn't about togive up my golf buddy.

983
00:53:20,780 --> 00:53:23,366
So, for almost ten yearswe've been sneaking off,

984
00:53:23,408 --> 00:53:26,077
twice a month, toplay in Green Point.

985
00:53:26,119 --> 00:53:29,372
We've tried, and failed, topatch this rift for years.

986
00:53:29,414 --> 00:53:31,625
I don't understand why theywon't even hear each other out.

987
00:53:31,666 --> 00:53:35,295
Sometimes an argument takes on alife of its own. So, in order

988
00:53:35,337 --> 00:53:38,589
to stay out of the mess, we've had to resort to this.

989
00:53:38,590 --> 00:53:41,468
Usually we're here whenit's still dark, but I

990
00:53:41,509 --> 00:53:44,554
was running late thismorning. and lo and behold,

991
00:53:44,596 --> 00:53:47,515
we run into you two, also sneaking around.

992
00:53:47,557 --> 00:53:50,435
Oh, this is not whatit seems, we're just

993
00:53:50,477 --> 00:53:54,271
helping each other out. This is completely innocent.

994
00:53:54,272 --> 00:53:56,274
But you have tokeep this a secret.

995
00:53:56,316 --> 00:54:00,904
That means youcan't tell anybody.

996
00:54:03,114 --> 00:54:06,534
You don't tell our secret, we won't tell yours.

997
00:54:21,633 --> 00:54:23,760
Well, let's call them!

998
00:54:23,802 --> 00:54:26,054
It's only been a fewdays since the meeting.

999
00:54:26,096 --> 00:54:28,473
I don't want them to thinkthat we're desperate.

1000
00:54:28,515 --> 00:54:31,559
I'm just concerned, Casey. Business has never

1001
00:54:31,601 --> 00:54:35,312
been this slow. We reallyneed this hotel account.

1002
00:54:35,313 --> 00:54:38,191
That's why I'm justgoing win the bake-off.

1003
00:54:38,233 --> 00:54:41,319
Now that my foot is better, letme help you with your recipe?

1004
00:54:41,361 --> 00:54:44,614
No, I'm good and youare going to love it.

1005

I'm pulling outall the stops.

1006
00:54:46,282 --> 00:54:48,368
But this is my thing, Casey. I don't

1007
00:54:48,410 --> 00:54:50,160
know why you won'tlet me help you.

1008
00:54:50,161 --> 00:54:52,539
Because you need to takeit easy, and I need to

1009
00:54:52,580 --> 00:54:57,460
prove to myself, and to you, that I can do this alone.

1010
00:54:59,421 --> 00:55:01,673
What? You don't thinkl can win, do you?

1011
00:55:01,715 --> 00:55:02,882
I never said that!

1012
00:55:02,924 --> 00:55:05,010
Mom, I made it to thefinals, On my own.

1013
00:55:05,051 --> 00:55:08,388
I know that, Casey, but let'sbe honest. Baking just isn't...

1014
00:55:08,430 --> 00:55:10,390
Don't you thatthink this place is

1015
00:55:10,432 --> 00:55:12,892
just as importantto me as it to you?

No. I'm sorry. I've been hereby myself all day. I haven't

1025
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:56,519
even looked at my phone. It's been one of those days.

1026
00:55:56,561 --> 00:55:57,645
Why? What's going on?

1027
00:55:57,937 --> 00:55:59,689

00:56:18,625 --> 00:56:22,837
Yeah, I got into a littlething with my mom today but...

1034
00:56:22,879 --> 00:56:24,422
it's nothing tobore you with.

00:56:24,464 --> 00:56:27,467
Well, I have an idea. Iwant to go out and celebrate

1036
00:56:27,509 --> 00:56:30,761
the good news and youlook like you need to

1037
00:56:30,762 --> 00:56:34,724
have some fun, so how aboutl take you out to dinner?

Yep. We're here.

1043
00:56:58,373 --> 00:57:03,920
OK. I admit it. Yougot me. I'm impressed.

1044
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:12,512
That was delicious, and exactlywhat I wanted. What I needed.

1045
00:57:12,554 --> 00:57:14,139
Thank you.

1046
00:57:14,180 --> 00:57:16,808
Sorry to hide us away likethis. I just figured it was

1047
00:57:16,850 --> 00:57:20,436
safer than someone seeingus together in town.

1048
00:57:20,478 --> 00:57:24,732
Are you kidding me? This is perfect.

1049
00:57:24,774 --> 00:57:28,194
I was thinking about whatyou said earlier. I think

1050
00:57:28,236 --> 00:57:30,864
you've more than provenyour worth to your mother.

1051
00:57:30,905 --> 00:57:33,867
You're probably right, Iguess I've come to

1052
00:57:33,908 --> 00:57:37,912
realize that I'm nevergoing to be her. And to be

1053

01:07:38,095 --> 01:07:40,848
I've been waitingto do that all day.

1227
01:07:40,890 --> 01:07:42,641
What are youthinking about?

1228
01:07:42,683 --> 01:07:44,393
Something my sister said.

1229
01:07:44,435 --> 01:07:45,436
What's that?

1230
01:07:45,770 --> 01:07:48,189
That everything's gonna workout the way it's supposed to.

1231
01:07:48,230 --> 01:07:50,399
Does that includewhat happens to us?

1232
01:07:50,441 --> 01:07:52,234
I certainly hope so. But all of this sneaking

1233
01:07:52,276 --> 01:07:54,987
around is reallymaking me anxious.

1234
01:07:55,029 --> 01:07:57,490
How about this, we keepour secret for a little

1235
01:07:57,531 --> 01:07:59,325
bit longer and then, after the bake-off,

1236
01:07:59,366 --> 01:08:01,951
we'll figure out howto make this work.

1237
01:08:01,952 --> 01:08:03,746
Okay.

1238
01:08:05,289 --> 01:08:06,665
Okay, let's go.

1239
01:08:13,589 --> 01:08:15,466
So, what is it like? Because according

1240
01:08:15,508 --> 01:08:18,219
to Betty, you werekissing Sam Harper.

1241
01:08:18,260 --> 01:08:20,346
I think Betty shouldmind her own business.

1242
01:08:20,387 --> 01:08:24,391
I knew it. You are trying tosend me to an early grave.

1243
01:08:24,433 --> 01:08:27,728
He's a Harper. The son ofthe woman who betrayed me.

1244
01:08:27,770 --> 01:08:29,146
Let's not forgetthat woman used

1245
01:08:29,188 --> 01:08:30,314
to be your bestfriend Faye.

1246
01:08:30,356 --> 01:08:32,274
Reggie, don'teven start.

1247
01:08:32,316 --> 01:08:34,443
How could you beso naive Casey?

1248
01:08:34,485 --> 01:08:36,445
Conspiring withthe enemy?

1249
01:08:36,487 --> 01:08:39,865
Enemy? Mom please. He's been helping me.

1250
01:08:39,907 --> 01:08:42,034
He's the one whogot me to finals.

1251
01:08:42,076 --> 01:08:45,579
Then he's got an angle. Harpers always have angles.

1252
01:08:45,621 --> 01:08:47,163
They're verygood at that.

1253
01:08:47,164 --> 01:08:50,543
It's been ten years, Mom. Whenare you going to let this go?

1254
01:08:50,584 --> 01:08:54,003
Don't you dare turn thisaround on me, Casey McArthy.

1255
01:08:54,004 --> 01:08:56,799
You did this.

1256
01:08:57,842 --> 01:08:59,343
Could she bemore dramatic?

1257
01:08:59,385 --> 01:09:03,513
She just needs to cooloff. She'll come around.

1258
01:09:03,514 --> 01:09:07,518
No, she won't.

1259
01:09:07,560 --> 01:09:09,103
You could be right.

1260
01:09:09,145 --> 01:09:10,729
Hundreds of women inthis town to choose

1261
01:09:10,771 --> 01:09:12,355
from and that's theone you pick?

1262
01:09:12,356 --> 01:09:13,690
She's not who youthink she is.

1263
01:09:13,691 --> 01:09:15,150
She is takingadvantage of you, Sam.

1264
01:09:15,192 --> 01:09:17,111
Distracting you from keepingyour eye on the prize.

1265
01:09:17,153 --> 01:09:18,946
You make her soundlike some kind of spy.

1266
01:09:18,988 --> 01:09:21,197
Well, I wouldn'tput it past her.

1267
01:09:21,198 --> 01:09:22,867
I'm sure her motherput her up to this.

1268
01:09:22,908 --> 01:09:24,827
Mom, nothing is moreimportant to me

1269
01:09:24,869 --> 01:09:27,413
than opening myrestaurant. Nothing.

1270
01:09:27,454 --> 01:09:29,582
Do you really think I would doanything to jeopardize that?

1271
01:09:29,623 --> 01:09:30,499
No.

1272
01:09:30,708 --> 01:09:33,543
Wait'll you see the businessplan I've developed.

1273
01:09:33,544 --> 01:09:34,378
Caseyhelped me.

1274
01:09:34,628 --> 01:09:38,799
So this whole Caseything is strategy?

1275
01:09:38,841 --> 01:09:42,887
Like, keep your friends closeand your enemies closer.

1276
01:09:43,012 --> 01:09:43,971
Well, I mean...

1277
01:09:44,221 --> 01:09:48,892
Okay, I like it. All's fairin love and pie, right?

1278
01:09:48,893 --> 01:09:51,020
As long as you bringhome the win son,

1279
01:09:51,061 --> 01:09:53,314
I don't care who youspend your time with.

1280
01:10:10,414 --> 01:10:13,250
So I'm a strategy?

1281
01:10:13,292 --> 01:10:16,503
That's not exactly what he said. Maybe he was just trying to

1282
01:10:16,545 --> 01:10:20,257
appease his mother, butit seemed that way, anyway.

1283
01:10:20,299 --> 01:10:22,801
I'll tell you right now, he cannot be trusted.

1284
01:10:22,843 --> 01:10:26,764
That family's motto is "Win at any cost."

1285
01:10:26,805 --> 01:10:30,517
It doesn't make any sense. He just... he seemed so...

1286
01:10:30,559 --> 01:10:33,687
Convincing? Charming?

1287
01:10:33,729 --> 01:10:36,105
Distracting!?

1288
01:10:36,106 --> 01:10:37,608
Genuine.

1289
01:10:37,650 --> 01:10:39,234
You need to gotalk to him.

1290
01:10:39,276 --> 01:10:40,235
No, she doesn't.

1291
01:10:40,277 --> 01:10:41,570
Yes, she does.

1292
01:10:41,612 --> 01:10:42,863
Whose side are you on?

1293
01:10:42,905 --> 01:10:44,781
I am on theside of love.

1294
01:10:44,782 --> 01:10:47,534
That's the cheesiestthing you've ever said.

1295
01:10:47,576 --> 01:10:51,580
Love?! You're not in lovewith that kid are you?

1296
01:10:51,622 --> 01:10:55,417
Mom! It's been lessthan two weeks.

1297
01:10:55,459 --> 01:10:58,127
No one falls inlove that fast.

1298
01:10:58,128 --> 01:10:59,713
I think...

1299
01:10:59,755 --> 01:11:01,966
Do you have any ideawhere he can be?

1300
01:11:02,007 --> 01:11:05,635
If I had to guess? Probablywatching the game at O'Malleys.

1301
01:11:05,636 --> 01:11:08,722
Then you go talk to him. Mom and I can close up.

1302
01:11:08,764 --> 01:11:09,932
What's the matterwith you...

1303
01:11:09,974 --> 01:11:12,017
We can close up.

1304
01:11:22,653 --> 01:11:25,572
What are you doing here? People are going to see us.

1305
01:11:25,614 --> 01:11:27,533
What does it matter? Cat's out of the

1306
01:11:27,574 --> 01:11:30,369
bag anyway, thanks tobig-mouth Betty.

1307
01:11:30,411 --> 01:11:32,328
Yeah. My motherwas furious.

1308
01:11:32,329 --> 01:11:37,167
Really? And what did youtell her? About me, about us?

1309
01:11:37,209 --> 01:11:40,087
I... didn't have a chanceto explain everything.

1310
01:11:40,129 --> 01:11:43,632
I know, my sister overheardyour conversation.

1311
01:11:43,674 --> 01:11:46,510
Something about mebeing a strategy?

1312
01:11:46,552 --> 01:11:48,429
Wait a minute, are youaccusing me of something?

1313
01:11:48,470 --> 01:11:52,016
No, I'm asking you. Wasthis some big plot?

1314
01:11:52,057 --> 01:11:57,313
Casey, no. She misunderstoodme. I swear to you.

1315
01:11:57,354 --> 01:11:59,189
Then why didn't youcorrect her then?

1316
01:11:59,231 --> 01:12:02,401
My mom can be very irrationalwhen she wants to be.

1317
01:12:02,443 --> 01:12:05,695
I was just tryingto calm her down.

1318
01:12:05,696 --> 01:12:10,367
I don't know Sam, maybethis isn't meant to be.

1319
01:12:10,409 --> 01:12:13,537
I know you don'tbelieve that, Casey.

1320
01:12:13,579 --> 01:12:15,331
We bring out thebest in each other.

1321
01:12:15,372 --> 01:12:18,333
Listen, we've come this far. Ourpie recipes are winners and one

1322
01:12:18,375 --> 01:12:20,043
of us is going to takethis thing home tomorrow.

1323
01:12:20,044 --> 01:12:21,754
Let's just see it through.

1324
01:12:22,713 --> 01:12:24,548
You can always dumpme after the contest.

1325
01:12:24,673 --> 01:12:29,470
Hey, how come you twoaren't on the local news?

1326
01:12:31,263 --> 01:12:32,056
Can you turn it up?

1327
01:12:32,556 --> 01:12:34,767
And you really think this Is your year Betty?

1328
01:12:34,808 --> 01:12:35,768
Yes I do.

1329
01:12:35,893 --> 01:12:37,311
I mean, it's been tough

1330
01:12:37,353 --> 01:12:38,312
When I've been up against

1331
01:12:38,562 --> 01:12:41,148
The likes of Faye McArthy and Lydia Harper.

1332
01:12:41,231 --> 01:12:42,191
But this year,

1333
01:12:42,399 --> 01:12:44,443
As everyone knows they're sitting it out.

1334
01:12:44,568 --> 01:12:45,736
And their kids are in.

1335
01:12:45,861 --> 01:12:48,197
So I'm gonna pullout all the stops.

1336
01:12:48,280 --> 01:12:49,572
...here to show what kind of pie we

1337
01:12:49,573 --> 01:12:50,907
have to look forward to tomorrow.

1338
01:12:50,908 --> 01:12:54,536
I have invented themost divine pumpkin

1339
01:12:54,578 --> 01:12:58,874
silk chiffon pie withbourbon whipped cream.

1340
01:12:58,916 --> 01:13:00,042
What? That's my pie!

1341
01:13:00,084 --> 01:13:03,420
And a ginger snapstreusel crust.

1342
01:13:03,462 --> 01:13:04,671
And that's my crust!

1343
01:13:04,713 --> 01:13:05,922
Mmm. Delicious!

1344
01:13:05,923 --> 01:13:07,966
Oh, it will be!

1345
01:13:08,008 --> 01:13:11,761
So, sweet little Bettyisn't so sweet after all.

1346
01:13:11,762 --> 01:13:14,014
So, what do we do?

1347
01:13:14,056 --> 01:13:15,099
You know what?

1348
01:13:15,140 --> 01:13:16,100
Working with you this pastweek,

1349
01:13:16,350 --> 01:13:18,102
I've realized somethingvery important.

1350
01:13:18,143 --> 01:13:19,978
Something my mothernever understood.

1351
01:13:20,020 --> 01:13:21,480
What's that?

1352
01:13:21,522 --> 01:13:26,151
You can create something uniquefor yourself with a partner.

1353
01:13:26,193 --> 01:13:27,653
I'm listening.

1354
01:13:27,694 --> 01:13:30,030
We're going tosee your mother.

1355
01:13:32,950 --> 01:13:34,868
Come on!

1356
01:13:36,412 --> 01:13:39,956
There's no way. Betty wouldnever do something like that.

1357
01:13:39,957 --> 01:13:41,333
Think about it, Mom.

1358
01:13:41,375 --> 01:13:42,918
She could neverbeat you and Lydia.

1359
01:13:42,960 --> 01:13:46,630
But me and Sam? She sawan opening and she took it.

1360
01:13:46,672 --> 01:13:49,174
She thinks she canwin with our recipe.

1361
01:13:49,216 --> 01:13:50,592
But she's my friend.

1362
01:13:50,634 --> 01:13:53,720
No she's not, Mom. She's anopportunist with zero medals

1363
01:13:53,762 --> 01:13:56,223
under her belt. That'sall that matters to her.

1364
01:13:56,265 --> 01:13:57,724
So, now what do we do?

1365
01:13:57,766 --> 01:13:59,393
You can't useyour recipe,

1366
01:13:59,435 --> 01:14:00,561
and you can't useyour pie crust.

1367
01:14:00,602 --> 01:14:02,645
It's been all overthe local news.

1368
01:14:02,646 --> 01:14:05,107
They'll think youstole it from her.

1369
01:14:05,149 --> 01:14:07,276
We have a plan.

1370
01:14:07,317 --> 01:14:09,153
What?

1371
01:14:09,194 --> 01:14:11,280
We all need togo see my mom.

1372
01:14:11,321 --> 01:14:12,865
Oh, ha ha ha.

1373
01:14:12,906 --> 01:14:16,910
Mom, if you won't do it forthe bakery, do it for me.

1374
01:14:20,831 --> 01:14:22,958
Sheesh!

1375
01:14:25,169 --> 01:14:28,005
Mom? Are you here?

1376
01:14:28,046 --> 01:14:30,090
Coming!

1377
01:14:35,095 --> 01:14:40,017
Mom, stop. We need to talkto you, it's important.

1378
01:14:41,143 --> 01:14:44,062
Lydia, it'sabout Betty.

1379
01:14:46,773 --> 01:14:49,484
So, how did Bettyget your recipe?

1380
01:14:49,526 --> 01:14:50,903
She came into thebakery and I guess

1381
01:14:50,944 --> 01:14:52,862
when she excused herselfto use the bathroom,

1382
01:14:52,863 --> 01:14:54,406
she must've seen iton the kitchen counter.

1383
01:14:54,448 --> 01:14:56,866
It never even occurredto me that I should hide it.

1384
01:14:56,867 --> 01:15:00,787
Really? I always hidemine in the store safe.

1385
01:15:00,829 --> 01:15:05,459
As do I! You never know howfar the competition will go.

1386
01:15:05,501 --> 01:15:06,877
Alright, takeit easy you two.

1387
01:15:07,002 --> 01:15:10,713
Well, I may have mentioned theginger snap streusel crust to

1388
01:15:10,714 --> 01:15:14,510
her at some point but... it's Betty. She's my friend.

1389
01:15:14,551 --> 01:15:19,473
Well, sometimes friendsbetray you, so...

1390
01:15:19,515 --> 01:15:21,141
So how does allthis affect us?

1391
01:15:21,183 --> 01:15:25,479
You guys used to spend a lot oftime here, baking. Together.

1392
01:15:25,520 --> 01:15:27,189
That's ancienthistory, honey.

1393
01:15:27,231 --> 01:15:30,733
Look, we have a plan, butwe need you both on board.

1394
01:15:30,734 --> 01:15:33,529
Come on, can you putyour differences aside?

1395
01:15:33,570 --> 01:15:35,072
This is forour businesses.

1396
01:15:35,113 --> 01:15:38,074
Yes, but only one of ourbusinesses can win so...

1397
01:15:38,075 --> 01:15:41,286
Not necessarily, butyou'll have to trust us.

1398
01:15:41,328 --> 01:15:43,830
Are you in?

1399
01:15:52,923 --> 01:15:57,678
Okay then. It all startswith one pumpkin pie.

1400
01:16:04,768 --> 01:16:06,687
We enter as a team. There's nothing in the

1401
01:16:06,728 --> 01:16:08,647
by-laws that says we can't join forces since

1402
01:16:08,689 --> 01:16:11,900
we've both qualified for the final round.

1403
01:16:13,068 --> 01:16:15,862
Which is where you come in. We have 12 hours and we need

1404
01:16:15,904 --> 01:16:17,781
your help to come up with a pumpkin pie

1405
01:16:17,823 --> 01:16:19,616
to put all other pies to shame.

1406
01:16:19,658 --> 01:16:23,328
And no one does that better than you two.

1407
01:16:46,226 --> 01:16:48,061
I have an idea.

1408
01:16:50,147 --> 01:16:51,982
Sam. Pecans.

1409
01:17:23,263 --> 01:17:25,640
Faye.

1410
01:17:25,682 --> 01:17:30,187
Can we take a minute? This may be long overdue,

1411
01:17:30,228 --> 01:17:32,939
but I feel lowe you an apology.

1412
01:17:32,981 --> 01:17:34,816
Lydia, let's just finishhelping the kids...

1413
01:17:34,858 --> 01:17:38,694
Will you please just... just let me finish?

1414
01:17:38,695 --> 01:17:43,200
I need to get thisoff my chest.

1415
01:17:43,241 --> 01:17:47,203
I should've fought for youwith my father, but I didn't.

1416
01:17:47,204 --> 01:17:51,625
It's just... you're sogood at this, Faye.

1417
01:17:51,667 --> 01:17:54,543
You've always been betterin the kitchen than me.

1418
01:17:54,544 --> 01:17:56,045
I guess I...

1419
01:17:56,046 --> 01:17:59,800
I just didn't want to livein your shadow anymore.

1420
01:17:59,841 --> 01:18:02,385
What are youtalking about?

1421
01:18:02,386 --> 01:18:05,055
You've got morebake-off wins than me.

1422
01:18:05,097 --> 01:18:07,224
You were alwaysprettier and...

1423
01:18:07,265 --> 01:18:10,268
the more populargirl in school.

1424
01:18:10,310 --> 01:18:12,729
You were neverin my shadow.

1425
01:18:12,771 --> 01:18:15,023
If anything, it wasthe other way around.

1426
01:18:15,065 --> 01:18:17,984
That's where you're wrong.

1427
01:18:18,026 --> 01:18:21,655
I've always beeninsecure around you.

1428
01:18:21,697 --> 01:18:23,906
The only way I was ableto beat you all these years

1429
01:18:23,907 --> 01:18:28,745
was by practicallyliving in the bakery.

1430
01:18:28,787 --> 01:18:32,999
And that nearlyruined my marriage.

1431
01:18:34,501 --> 01:18:37,129
In the end...

1432
01:18:37,170 --> 01:18:43,009
I guess I just wanted to proveto you that I could do it.

1433
01:18:43,051 --> 01:18:46,763
Well, I wish you hadn't waited10 years to tell me all that.

1434
01:18:46,805 --> 01:18:50,767
I never wanted this togo on as long as it did.

1435
01:18:50,809 --> 01:18:53,769
Me neither.

1436
01:18:53,770 --> 01:18:56,105
But you know, in some strange way,

1437
01:18:56,106 --> 01:18:59,901
I think we kind ofhelped each other.

1438
01:18:59,943 --> 01:19:02,446
It sounds like I wasthe motivation for you

1439
01:19:02,487 --> 01:19:04,781
to become a betterbaker, and you certainly

1440
01:19:04,823 --> 01:19:08,452
motivated me to startmy own business.

1441
01:19:08,493 --> 01:19:11,496
I'm sorry Faye.

1442
01:19:11,538 --> 01:19:13,457
Me too.

1443
01:19:14,958 --> 01:19:16,125
A fresh start?

1444
01:19:16,126 --> 01:19:18,211
Absolutely.

1445
01:19:20,213 --> 01:19:24,176
Now, will you finallygive me the recipe

1446
01:19:24,217 --> 01:19:25,427
for your pumpkin scones?

1447
01:19:25,469 --> 01:19:28,054
Let's not get crazy.

1448
01:19:33,935 --> 01:19:35,854
Tell me I'm not dreaming.

1449
01:19:35,896 --> 01:19:39,900
Nope, looks like the coldwar has finally ended.

1450
01:19:56,416 --> 01:19:58,376
This is the one.

1451
01:19:58,418 --> 01:20:02,505
Pumpkin cheesecake piewith a pecan caramel topping.

1452
01:20:02,506 --> 01:20:04,382
It's perfect.

1453
01:20:04,424 --> 01:20:08,303
Now you're going to have torecreate it at the festival.

1454
01:20:08,345 --> 01:20:10,847
And you only get one shot.

1455
01:20:10,889 --> 01:20:13,433
I have worked outevery last detail.

1456
01:20:13,475 --> 01:20:16,019
It's what she does.

1457
01:20:16,061 --> 01:20:20,732
Ok guys, let's do this.

1458
01:20:35,288 --> 01:20:39,000
[Applause]

1459
01:20:52,514 --> 01:20:56,225
Oh, no. Did someone dropout of the competition?

1460
01:20:56,226 --> 01:20:59,061
No. As a matter of fact, Betty, two of your competitors

1461
01:20:59,062 --> 01:21:02,691
have decided to compete inthe final round as a team.

1462
01:21:02,732 --> 01:21:04,859
I don't meanto be difficult,

1463
01:21:04,901 --> 01:21:07,195
but isn't thatagainst the rules?

1464
01:21:07,237 --> 01:21:09,948
That's what I thought, so I ranit by the contest officials

1465
01:21:09,990 --> 01:21:12,659
and you're not going tobelieve what they said.

1466
01:21:12,701 --> 01:21:15,370
It's completely legal.

1467
01:21:18,748 --> 01:21:21,501
Okay. Great.

1468
01:21:21,543 --> 01:21:24,296
Makes it all the moreinteresting, right?

1469
01:21:24,337 --> 01:21:25,714
Sure does!

1470
01:21:25,755 --> 01:21:28,133
[Applause]

1471
01:21:32,178 --> 01:21:37,642
That's 60 minutes to bake andthe clock... starts... now!

1472
01:21:47,444 --> 01:21:49,111
Betty has my recipe.

1473
01:21:49,112 --> 01:21:50,947
Yeah, I know. Weknew this already.

01:21:50,989 --> 01:21:53,366
No I mean, a pictureof my actual recipe

1475
01:21:53,408 --> 01:21:55,827
in my handwritingon her tablet.

1476
01:21:55,869 --> 01:21:58,705
So she didn't just copy theidea, she took a photo of it?

1477
01:21:58,747 --> 01:21:59,456
Yes!

1478
01:21:59,664 --> 01:22:00,916
Do you still haveyour copy of it?

1479
01:22:00,957 --> 01:22:02,334
Of course I do, it's in my bag.

1480
01:22:02,459 --> 01:22:06,462
Then we're going to make this afestival they'll never forget.

1481
01:22:06,463 --> 01:22:09,633

How did you ever come upwith a recipe like that?

1490
01:22:43,958 --> 01:22:47,253
I... just years ofexperience I guess.

1491
01:22:47,295 --> 01:22:52,550

1496
01:23:03,228 --> 01:23:06,648

01:23:14,531 --> 01:23:16,908
That's not true!

1501
01:23:17,701 --> 01:23:19,160
Is that true, Betty?

1502
01:23:19,202 --> 01:23:23,164
