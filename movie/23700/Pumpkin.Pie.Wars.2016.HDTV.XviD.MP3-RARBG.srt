00:01:28,422 --> 00:01:32,162
year's Lake Shore County
Pumpkin Pie bake-off!

00:01:33,327 --> 00:01:35,127
Here we go!

22
00:01:35,162 --> 00:01:36,702
Love the pie.

23
00:01:39,166 --> 00:01:42,396
I just realized that I
never wished you good luck.

24
00:01:42,436 --> 00:01:44,996
Probably because you
don't really mean it.

25
00:01:45,039 --> 00:01:47,639
Look, I was going to
tell you, Faye, I just...

26
00:01:47,675 --> 00:01:51,075
Tell me what? That you've thrown
all our plans in the garbage

27
00:01:51,112 --> 00:01:53,652
and you're going to open
a bakery without me?

28
00:01:53,681 --> 00:01:56,781
It was my father's decision.
It's his money, Faye,

29
00:01:56,817 --> 00:01:59,147
and he wanted to
gamble on me, alone.

30
00:01:59,186 --> 00:02:01,916
Sure, after I've taught
you everything you know.

31
00:02:01,956 --> 00:02:04,456
You've never had a cooking
lesson. If it wasn't for me,

32
00:02:04,492 --> 00:02:07,032
you'd still be using
pre-made cookie dough.

33
00:02:07,061 --> 00:02:08,261
How dare you?

34
00:02:08,295 --> 00:02:09,755
[Crowd gasping]

35
00:02:09,797 --> 00:02:11,757
Yeesh!

36
00:02:11,799 --> 00:02:13,469
It's been years since
I've used that stuff!

37
00:02:13,501 --> 00:02:15,101
Yeah right.

38
00:02:15,136 --> 00:02:16,566
You only had one win!

39
00:02:16,604 --> 00:02:19,514
Pre-made cookie dough.

40
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:22,310
This wasn't my call! If I wanted
the space on Fuller Street,

41
00:02:22,343 --> 00:02:24,083
I had to accept his
offer immediately.

42
00:02:24,111 --> 00:02:26,811
Even if it meant
stabbing me in the back?

43
00:02:26,847 --> 00:02:31,417
Ok ladies, let's leave the
knives in the food please.

44
00:02:35,322 --> 00:02:38,792
Looks like we may have to
cancel our golf game tomorrow.

45
00:02:38,826 --> 00:02:40,526
Are you kidding me?

46
00:02:40,561 --> 00:02:44,401
It looks like it might
be canceled permanently.

47
00:02:44,431 --> 00:02:46,971
Yeah.

48
00:02:47,001 --> 00:02:51,271
Faye! Please.
You're my best friend.

49
00:02:51,305 --> 00:02:54,335
We never made definite plans.
It was all just a pipe-dream.

50
00:02:54,375 --> 00:02:56,135
Oh, so that bank
loan I applied for,

51
00:02:56,177 --> 00:02:57,177
that was just a
"pipe-dream"?

52
00:02:57,211 --> 00:02:58,981
Look, I'm sorry
about that. I am--

53
00:02:59,013 --> 00:03:02,013
Don't be. Really. I
don't need you, Lydia.

54
00:03:02,049 --> 00:03:04,149
I'm going to open
my own bake shop.

55
00:03:04,185 --> 00:03:05,375
Right Reggie?

56
00:03:05,419 --> 00:03:08,149
Um... yeah?

57
00:03:08,189 --> 00:03:11,689
And for your information, I
already have a line of credit,

58
00:03:11,725 --> 00:03:15,155
a life time of recipes and this
here trophy, which I'm going

59
00:03:15,196 --> 00:03:20,226
to display prominently in the
front window of my new bakery.

60
00:03:20,267 --> 00:03:23,097
Are you sure you want to go
head-to- head with me, Faye?

61
00:03:23,137 --> 00:03:25,397
Is that a threat?

62
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:27,409
It's a dare.

63
00:03:27,441 --> 00:03:31,541
Well, I guess this is war.

64
00:03:31,579 --> 00:03:33,549
Take care, Reg.

65
00:03:33,581 --> 00:03:36,421
Take care, Max.

66
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:04,410
Casey? I need you
for a taste test.

67
00:04:04,445 --> 00:04:09,275
Casey, I need you
for a taste test!

68
00:04:09,316 --> 00:04:11,316
Shoot!

69
00:04:13,153 --> 00:04:15,293
We need to fix that thing.

70
00:04:15,322 --> 00:04:17,592
Casey?

71
00:04:17,625 --> 00:04:20,425
<i> Yeah?</i>

72
00:04:20,461 --> 00:04:23,301
Hey, Mom, I'm revising our
operating budget and I

73
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:25,930
need you to take a look
at these line items...

74
00:04:25,966 --> 00:04:28,796
Casey, I don't know
what any of this means.

75
00:04:28,836 --> 00:04:30,266
That's why I've got you!

76
00:04:30,304 --> 00:04:34,074
Well, it means, if we cut a few
specialty items off the menu

77
00:04:34,108 --> 00:04:38,208
we could come out of the
red. Maybe, I hope...

78
00:04:38,245 --> 00:04:39,535
I'm also
developing a new

79
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:41,110
advertising and
marketing plan for us.

80
00:04:41,148 --> 00:04:43,248
And how much is
that going to cost?

81
00:04:43,284 --> 00:04:44,724
I promise I'll
be conservative.

82
00:04:44,752 --> 00:04:47,922
Well, if we get The Buckeye
Hotel account, we may not

83
00:04:47,955 --> 00:04:52,815
have to worry, right? We'd be
baking a lot of pastries for

84
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:54,260
a lot of
continental breakfasts.

85
00:04:54,295 --> 00:04:57,655
Yeah, of course, but I can't
budget based on "what ifs."

86
00:04:57,698 --> 00:05:00,468
I'm figuring this out from
a strategic standpoint.

87
00:05:00,501 --> 00:05:02,371
You just focus
on the baking.

88
00:05:02,403 --> 00:05:04,943
Speaking of which,
come. I want you to sample

89
00:05:04,972 --> 00:05:07,242
the front-runners for
this year's bake-off.

90
00:05:07,274 --> 00:05:08,474
Okay.

91
00:05:10,444 --> 00:05:13,954
That's why we're in
trouble, you know.

92
00:05:13,981 --> 00:05:17,481
In the past, profits
soared every time I won.

93
00:05:17,518 --> 00:05:21,288
But now? Losing three
years in a row to that...

94
00:05:21,322 --> 00:05:24,492
that traitor,
Lydia Harper.

95
00:05:24,525 --> 00:05:26,585
I bet her bakery
is booming.

96
00:05:26,627 --> 00:05:30,057
I know, but this is
your year... I can feel it!

97
00:05:30,097 --> 00:05:33,467
And I promise you, we're
going to turn the ship around.

98
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,670
From your lips to
God's ears, honey.

00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:51,053
What are you doing
here so late, Case?

103
00:05:51,085 --> 00:05:53,215
I just came to check
up on her again.

104
00:05:53,253 --> 00:05:56,223
She's resting. The medication
is helping the physical pain

105
00:05:56,256 --> 00:06:00,726
but the mental pain is
another matter entirely.

106
00:06:00,761 --> 00:06:02,891
Did they really say
six weeks off her feet?

107
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:04,930
Could be longer if
it doesn't heal right.

108
00:06:04,965 --> 00:06:08,695
Just pray she
doesn't need surgery.

109
00:06:08,736 --> 00:06:10,696
I should've fixed
that step sooner.

110
00:06:10,738 --> 00:06:13,338
C'mon, you both had
a lot on your plate.

111
00:06:13,374 --> 00:06:15,244
Well, I already arranged
for a substitute baker for

112
00:06:15,275 --> 00:06:17,475
the morning, but that's
all we can afford now.

113
00:06:17,511 --> 00:06:21,711
Unless you want to take
on some of the baking.

114
00:06:21,749 --> 00:06:25,349
Of course, we all know what
happened the last time...

115
00:06:25,386 --> 00:06:28,286
Alright, well I'll just
focus on working on that

116
00:06:28,322 --> 00:06:31,222
hotel account and the
new baker can focus on

117
00:06:31,258 --> 00:06:33,088
cooking until Mom's
back on her feet.

118
00:06:33,127 --> 00:06:34,757
I have it all
figured out.

119
00:06:34,795 --> 00:06:37,395

00:06:37,431 --> 00:06:40,071
Oh no, the bake-off!

121
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:42,070
Yep.

122
00:06:42,102 --> 00:06:44,002
That's not good! What
are we going to do?

123
00:06:44,037 --> 00:06:45,937
You're the public face
of The Sweet Factory now,

124
00:06:45,973 --> 00:06:47,643
you're going to have
to do it in her place.

00:06:50,644 --> 00:06:52,214

Why not? You're a smart girl.
You got a 4.0 at Wharton.

128
00:06:54,815 --> 00:06:56,945
Dad! I almost burned
down the store.

129
00:06:56,984 --> 00:06:59,954
Case, you didn't burn down
the store, and furthermore,

130
00:06:59,987 --> 00:07:01,647
I believe in you.

131
00:07:01,688 --> 00:07:05,118
I don't believe in me. Not
when it comes to the kitchen.

132
00:07:05,159 --> 00:07:07,729
Go talk to your mother,
see what she thinks.

133
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:12,131
And stop worrying, we're insured
if you burn down the place.

134
00:07:12,166 --> 00:07:15,566
Cute, Dad. Really cute.

135
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,070
You want to enter
the bake-off?

136
00:07:21,108 --> 00:07:22,608
No, but someone has to.

137
00:07:22,643 --> 00:07:25,313
I'm just going to have to do
this myself, we have no choice.

[Groaning]

139
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,980
You were saying?

00:07:28,015 --> 00:07:29,605
You have to stay
off that ankle.

141
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:31,820
You can't stand for
an hour, baking.

142
00:07:31,852 --> 00:07:34,922
But we have to win
this thing, Casey.

143
00:07:34,955 --> 00:07:37,055
Our business
depends on it.

144
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:38,560
Look, maybe
it's not so bad.

145
00:07:38,592 --> 00:07:41,132
The bake-off is the centerpiece
for the harvest festival,

146
00:07:41,161 --> 00:07:44,661
everyone pays attention,
but it needs a new story.

147
00:07:44,698 --> 00:07:47,268
I mean, your big feud
with Lydia Harper

148
00:07:47,301 --> 00:07:50,041
is hardly a feud
if she keeps winning.

149
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:52,470
And that story is you?

150
00:07:52,506 --> 00:07:54,606
Me going up against her?

151
00:07:54,641 --> 00:07:57,781
That'll get people
talking about our place.

152
00:07:57,811 --> 00:08:00,981
Okay, I'm listening.

153
00:08:01,014 --> 00:08:04,084
Grandma passed all of her
recipes on to you, right?

154
00:08:04,117 --> 00:08:08,287
You get to pass this on to
me. It's the circle of life.

155
00:08:08,322 --> 00:08:11,492
And maybe we get some
free press out of it.

156
00:08:11,525 --> 00:08:12,915
Come on Mom, let me try.

157
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:16,130
For the bakery.
For us.

158
00:08:16,163 --> 00:08:19,233
Okay, for us.

159
00:08:19,266 --> 00:08:21,766
And we've got enough
insurance, so...

160
00:08:21,802 --> 00:08:24,072
Why does everyone keep
saying that? It's not funny.

161
00:08:24,104 --> 00:08:25,844
I'm just kidding.

162
00:08:25,873 --> 00:08:30,083
But seriously, you need
to beat Lydia Harper.

163
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:32,210
Because all this publicity
you've been talking about,

164
00:08:32,246 --> 00:08:35,246
it may help our business
with some tourists,

165
00:08:35,282 --> 00:08:40,752
but a winning the bake-off
will bring in the locals.

166
00:08:42,322 --> 00:08:44,162
Okay.

167
00:08:45,559 --> 00:08:46,889
I can do that.

168
00:08:46,927 --> 00:08:48,587
Good.

169
00:08:59,706 --> 00:09:02,636
Go get my mom. She will
not be able to resist my

170
00:09:02,676 --> 00:09:06,076
signature mac and cheese
with ham and gruyere.

171
00:09:06,113 --> 00:09:09,783
Sam, she said no a
hundred times already.

172
00:09:09,816 --> 00:09:11,876
Maybe 101 is the charm.

173
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:14,089
[Laughing]

174
00:09:14,888 --> 00:09:19,488
Ah, that time of the
year already, is it?

175
00:09:19,526 --> 00:09:21,226
All these years and you're
still having someone

176
00:09:21,261 --> 00:09:23,331
sneak you Faye McArthy's
pumpkin scones?

177
00:09:23,363 --> 00:09:26,603
I hate myself for
liking them so much.

178
00:09:26,633 --> 00:09:30,773
I have tried to recreate
this recipe a dozen times!

179
00:09:30,804 --> 00:09:36,414
Well, I have something delicious
that'll take your mind off that.

180
00:09:36,443 --> 00:09:40,783
I already told you, Sam,
we're not expanding the menu.

181
00:09:40,814 --> 00:09:42,384
Is this or is this
not our business?

182
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:45,576
It is our business but
I'm still in charge.

183
00:09:45,619 --> 00:09:48,919
Look Mom, you've won the
bake-off three years in a row.

184
00:09:48,956 --> 00:09:50,956
Why not ride the wave?
We could have

185
00:09:50,991 --> 00:09:52,761
a full-service restaurant
by the end of the year.

186
00:09:52,793 --> 00:09:54,833
This place couldn't handle
that kind of volume.

187
00:09:54,861 --> 00:09:57,961
So we build a second story.
Or buy the place next door.

188
00:09:57,998 --> 00:09:59,928
That sounds a lot
like expanding,

189
00:09:59,967 --> 00:10:01,897
and we do not have
the money for that.

190
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:06,265
We apply for a loan. It'll
pay for itself in no time.

191
00:10:06,306 --> 00:10:07,566
What is your
favorite expression?

192
00:10:07,608 --> 00:10:09,568
[Together] Create something
unique for yourself.

193
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:12,140
Yes. And right now,
you and Faye McArthy

194
00:10:12,179 --> 00:10:15,179
are like two sides
of the same coin.

195
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:17,519
Don't you want to
be more than her?

196
00:10:17,551 --> 00:10:20,621
Of course I do.
I always do.

197
00:10:20,654 --> 00:10:22,994
Then this is how you
take it to the next level.

198
00:10:23,023 --> 00:10:24,693
I'm sorry Sam,

199
00:10:24,725 --> 00:10:27,325
but it's just not
financially feasible for us.

200
00:10:27,361 --> 00:10:29,661
<i> [Bell ringing]</i>

201
00:10:29,696 --> 00:10:32,756
Well then maybe I need to
reconsider my future here

202
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:36,129
because I didn't spend two years
at the Cordon Bleu in London

203
00:10:36,169 --> 00:10:37,969
to make banana cupcakes
and lemon bars

204
00:10:38,005 --> 00:10:39,295
for the rest
of my life.

205
00:10:39,339 --> 00:10:41,009
<i> [Bell ringing]</i>

206
00:10:43,977 --> 00:10:48,207
<i> (Lydia) Hello, how are you?</i>
<i> How's your day?</i>

207
00:11:12,039 --> 00:11:15,769
Wow. Only
17?

208
00:11:15,809 --> 00:11:17,139
Great.

209
00:11:22,849 --> 00:11:24,579
Hi!

210
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:31,020
Okay, I know that look.
What have you heard?

211
00:11:31,058 --> 00:11:34,358
That Faye McArthy broke her
fibula or tibia or something.

212
00:11:34,394 --> 00:11:37,804
And she has to stay off her
foot for more than a month.

213
00:11:37,831 --> 00:11:42,931
So, Casey McArthy is entering
the bake-off in her place.

214
00:11:42,969 --> 00:11:44,499
She does the books.

215
00:11:44,538 --> 00:11:47,368
Great. So it'll be
an easy win for you.

216
00:11:47,407 --> 00:11:51,207
Actually, it's going to
be an easy win for you.

217
00:11:51,244 --> 00:11:54,014
Uh huh, I'm passing
you the torch, son.

218
00:11:54,047 --> 00:11:55,507
And what if I
refuse the torch?

219
00:11:55,549 --> 00:11:57,919
You can't refuse the torch,
it's your birthright.

220
00:11:57,951 --> 00:12:00,351
I don't think it is.
Look Mom, I really don't

221
00:12:00,387 --> 00:12:02,687
want to take on your
feud with Faye McArthy.

222
00:12:02,723 --> 00:12:04,823
And it's not even Faye,
it's her daughter.

223
00:12:04,858 --> 00:12:06,188
Think of the publicity.

224
00:12:06,226 --> 00:12:11,826
The Harper-McArthy feud
moves to the next generation.

225
00:12:11,865 --> 00:12:13,825
Plus, it's no fun
for me if I don't

226
00:12:13,867 --> 00:12:15,397
get the satisfaction
of beating Faye.

227
00:12:15,435 --> 00:12:17,565
Mom, it's a
pumpkin pie contest.

228
00:12:17,604 --> 00:12:20,314
No, Sam. It is the
pumpkin pie contest.

229
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:21,640
The TV news covers it.

230
00:12:21,675 --> 00:12:24,005
The papers. The final round
is featured on the Culinary

231
00:12:24,044 --> 00:12:26,284
Channel show, "Pie
Heaven." And you know

232
00:12:26,313 --> 00:12:28,453
what happens every time
last year's episode airs.

233
00:12:28,482 --> 00:12:29,852
We run out of pie.

234
00:12:29,883 --> 00:12:33,553
We run out of everything!

235
00:12:33,587 --> 00:12:38,217
Sam, I know we've been having
some disagreements lately,

236
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:41,288
but it's important to me.

237
00:12:41,328 --> 00:12:44,728
Okay, fine. I'll do it.

238
00:12:44,765 --> 00:12:46,595
But then you have to
do something for me.

239
00:12:46,633 --> 00:12:48,133
What's that?

240
00:12:48,168 --> 00:12:50,968
I'm going to put together
some sort of presentation.

241
00:12:51,004 --> 00:12:53,944
A business plan
for our restaurant.

242
00:12:53,974 --> 00:12:56,544
And you will
consider it.

243
00:12:56,576 --> 00:12:59,776
It's important to me.

244
00:13:03,283 --> 00:13:06,553
Okay, it's a deal.

245
00:13:06,586 --> 00:13:08,746
Great. Now let's
talk pumpkin.

246
00:13:16,863 --> 00:13:20,033
It's important that you wear
your game face at all times.

247
00:13:20,066 --> 00:13:23,836
In this competition, they
prey on your weaknesses. Hi!

248
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:25,100
It's a dog eat dog world

249
00:13:25,138 --> 00:13:27,668
and that is nothing
compared to the bake-off.

250
00:13:27,707 --> 00:13:30,237
Every eye in town will
be on you, watching you.

251
00:13:30,277 --> 00:13:31,637
Be careful what you say.

252
00:13:31,678 --> 00:13:32,938
Be careful what you do.

253
00:13:32,979 --> 00:13:34,309
There is no room for error.

254
00:13:34,347 --> 00:13:36,777
There is no room for error.

255
00:13:38,585 --> 00:13:39,945
Excuse me.

256
00:13:39,986 --> 00:13:42,186
Excuse me.

257
00:13:44,324 --> 00:13:45,994
This is like
The Hunger Games.

258
00:13:46,026 --> 00:13:49,526
I don't know what that means,
but I'm sure this is worse.

259
00:13:51,498 --> 00:13:53,158
[Crowd applause]

260
00:13:55,535 --> 00:13:58,835
Alright, alright. Save
it for the big show.

261
00:13:58,872 --> 00:14:01,472
So we all know the rules.
There's two rounds of judging:

262
00:14:01,508 --> 00:14:03,508
<i> Round one, all 12</i>
<i> contestants will bake</i>

263
00:14:03,543 --> 00:14:05,643
<i> their very own loaf of</i>
<i> gourmet pumpkin bread.</i>

264
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:08,209
Our three judges will then
choose three winners.

265
00:14:08,248 --> 00:14:13,148
For round two, finalists will
bake an original pumpkin pie.

266
00:14:13,186 --> 00:14:15,486
<i> We've seen it all before</i>
<i> folks, so let's please</i>

267
00:14:15,522 --> 00:14:18,022
<i> try and be extra</i>
<i> creative this year, alright?</i>

268
00:14:18,058 --> 00:14:20,158
What's the best thing to
put into a pumpkin pie?

269
00:14:20,193 --> 00:14:23,063
[Everyone together]
Your teeth!

270
00:14:23,096 --> 00:14:28,466
Now please form a single file
line at the table to register.

271
00:14:29,536 --> 00:14:31,836
Come on, you'll
be fine! Go!

272
00:14:47,888 --> 00:14:49,948
Come by the shop!

273
00:14:52,826 --> 00:14:54,156
Case?

274
00:14:54,194 --> 00:14:58,404
Hey. I didn't know I'd be
going up against Sam Harper.

275
00:14:58,431 --> 00:15:01,571
There was nothing that guy
wasn't good at in high school.

276
00:15:01,601 --> 00:15:02,801
I mean, we weren't
friends, thanks

277
00:15:02,836 --> 00:15:04,866
to your war with
Mrs. Harper.

278
00:15:04,905 --> 00:15:07,435
That doesn't seem to have
ruined your life dear.

279
00:15:07,474 --> 00:15:10,714
I guess not, but, he's a
professional chef.

280
00:15:10,744 --> 00:15:12,884
He does all the baking
for Fuller Street.

281
00:15:12,913 --> 00:15:14,083
I can't compete with that.

282
00:15:14,114 --> 00:15:15,754
Yes you can!

283
00:15:15,782 --> 00:15:20,022
And with any luck, mediocrity
runs through his Harper veins.

284
00:15:20,053 --> 00:15:23,693
And you've got my blood
running through yours.

285
00:15:23,723 --> 00:15:26,063
And I'll teach you
everything I know.

286
00:15:26,092 --> 00:15:28,462
No way, Mom.
Absolutely not.

287
00:15:28,495 --> 00:15:31,055
The doctor said
that foot has to heal.

288
00:15:31,097 --> 00:15:32,927
And besides,
I... I have to learn how

289
00:15:32,966 --> 00:15:35,596
to run things on my
own sooner or later.

290
00:15:35,635 --> 00:15:38,765
There's Eleanor Field,
I've got to go talk to her

291
00:15:38,805 --> 00:15:40,705
about her granddaughter's
birthday cake.

292
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:42,010
Anyway, I'll see you
back at the car.

293
00:15:42,042 --> 00:15:43,612
Okay.

294
00:15:52,118 --> 00:15:53,448
Hey!

295
00:15:55,121 --> 00:15:58,221
Oh! Sam Harper.

296
00:15:58,258 --> 00:15:59,788
Casey McArthy.

297
00:15:59,826 --> 00:16:01,426
I haven't seen you
around town lately.

298
00:16:01,461 --> 00:16:04,501
We McArthys like to
keep a low profile.

299
00:16:04,531 --> 00:16:07,771
Ah, of course. How
else would you keep

300
00:16:07,801 --> 00:16:10,271
your secret recipes
hidden from my family?

301
00:16:10,303 --> 00:16:12,973
Exactly. So how's
business on your end?

302
00:16:13,006 --> 00:16:14,466
[Laughing]

303
00:16:14,507 --> 00:16:16,007
Wouldn't you love to know?

304
00:16:16,042 --> 00:16:18,912
Nope. Just trying
to be cordial.

305
00:16:18,945 --> 00:16:21,945
Ours is killing
it, by the way.

306
00:16:21,982 --> 00:16:23,652
The fact that you feel
the need to tell me that,

307
00:16:23,683 --> 00:16:25,453
makes it sound a
little questionable.

308
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:27,215
Feel free to think
what you want.

309
00:16:27,253 --> 00:16:29,693
I wouldn't want to burden
you with actual facts.

310
00:16:29,723 --> 00:16:33,163
So... are you ready? This
thing could get ugly, you know.

311
00:16:33,193 --> 00:16:34,533
Of course it will.

312
00:16:34,561 --> 00:16:37,361
It's the world famous
bake-off, after all.

313
00:16:37,397 --> 00:16:39,627
But seriously Casey,
you don't actually think

314
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:41,466
you can beat me,
do you? I mean...

315
00:16:41,501 --> 00:16:43,631
I've been doing this
thing since high school.

316
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:46,840
Okay sure, maybe I don't
have your culinary training

317
00:16:46,873 --> 00:16:48,573
and all your years
in the kitchen,

318
00:16:48,608 --> 00:16:51,608
but where I come from,
we're taught to think

319
00:16:51,644 --> 00:16:54,414
outside the box.
And fortunate for me,

320
00:16:54,447 --> 00:16:56,647
outside the box is
where I live and breathe.

321
00:16:56,683 --> 00:16:58,153
You're pretty
confident aren't you?

322
00:16:58,184 --> 00:17:00,694
That's right, and I can't
wait to see your face

323
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,890
when this rookie
takes first place

324
00:17:02,922 --> 00:17:04,892
in front of the
entire town.

325
00:17:04,924 --> 00:17:06,564
Game on, Miss McArthy.

326
00:17:06,593 --> 00:17:08,933
Game on Mr. Harper.

327
00:17:29,215 --> 00:17:31,975
Casey!

328
00:17:32,018 --> 00:17:33,918
I said mix the batter.

329
00:17:33,953 --> 00:17:34,953
That's what I'm doing.

330
00:17:34,988 --> 00:17:39,588
No, a spoon stirs,
a mixer mixes.

331
00:17:39,626 --> 00:17:42,156
Oh. Well, you
didn't say that.

332
00:17:42,195 --> 00:17:44,825
I thought it was a given.
You did grow up in a bakery.

333
00:17:44,864 --> 00:17:47,304
Yes, and I've watched you do
this a million times,

334
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:49,333
so can you
please go home now?

335
00:17:49,369 --> 00:17:50,939
I have to practice
and I don't need

336
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:53,340
to worry about you
hobbling around here.

337
00:17:53,373 --> 00:17:55,813
Oh, I forgot, your
sister is coming to town

338
00:17:55,842 --> 00:17:57,612
early to help us
out with the festival.

339
00:17:57,644 --> 00:17:58,514
Great!

340
00:17:58,545 --> 00:17:59,975
Do you want to come
to the house early

341
00:18:00,013 --> 00:18:04,553
tonight just to
discuss strategy?

342
00:18:04,584 --> 00:18:06,684
For your pitch meeting
with The Buckeye Hotel?

343
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:08,819
Yes! Now, can you
please go home?

344
00:18:08,855 --> 00:18:09,645
Dad's been
waiting for you

345
00:18:09,689 --> 00:18:11,419
in the car for
the last 15 minutes.

346
00:18:11,458 --> 00:18:14,658
Just, keep practicing!
You'll be okay.

347
00:18:30,743 --> 00:18:33,543
Hey Mom, can you call me when
you get this?

348
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:36,010
It says I need a
baking pumpkin

349
00:18:36,049 --> 00:18:37,349
and I don't know
what that means.

350
00:18:37,383 --> 00:18:42,553
They all look the
same to me. Okay, bye.

351
00:18:42,589 --> 00:18:45,519
Isn't a pumpkin
just a pumpkin?

352
00:18:45,558 --> 00:18:48,358
Actually, no, it's not.

353
00:18:48,394 --> 00:18:50,064
I'm surprised you
didn't learn that at the

354
00:18:50,096 --> 00:18:52,296
bakery you run
with your mother?

355
00:18:52,332 --> 00:18:54,532
As you know, I tend to the
business side of things.

356
00:18:54,567 --> 00:18:57,867
She bakes. It's a
perfect partnership.

357
00:18:57,904 --> 00:19:00,514
But you're the one entering the
bake-off,

358
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:01,710
and you don't know
the difference between

359
00:19:01,741 --> 00:19:03,571
a carving pumpkin
and a baking pumpkin?

360
00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:08,080
I do. I own a bakery.

361
00:19:08,114 --> 00:19:12,184
It's just that my
specialties lie elsewhere.

362
00:19:12,218 --> 00:19:14,418
Like on a spreadsheet?

363
00:19:14,454 --> 00:19:17,224
I have many
other talents...

364
00:19:17,257 --> 00:19:18,357
I'm listening.

365
00:19:18,391 --> 00:19:20,661
You think I'm just going
to show you all my cards?

366
00:19:20,693 --> 00:19:22,533
What? You think you're
holding a royal flush?

367
00:19:22,562 --> 00:19:24,832
I just might be.
So I suggest you

368
00:19:24,864 --> 00:19:27,774
fold now to avoid
embarrassment.

369
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:30,640
I never fold.

370
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:33,270
Oh, this is good,
we're just...

371
00:19:33,306 --> 00:19:36,336
carrying on an age-old
family tradition.

372
00:19:36,376 --> 00:19:38,376
Harpers vs. McArthys.

373
00:19:38,411 --> 00:19:39,281
It's heartwarming,
isn't it?

374
00:19:39,312 --> 00:19:41,352
Yeah I can't wait to
see how it plays out.

375
00:19:41,381 --> 00:19:43,311
Ditto.

376
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:46,780
Good luck finding
your baking pumpkin.

377
00:19:46,819 --> 00:19:51,189
Trust me, luck has
nothing to do with it.

378
00:19:54,127 --> 00:19:56,987
So, what's a
baking pumpkin?

379
00:20:01,334 --> 00:20:04,604
<i> Maple scones,</i>
<i> oh and croissants.</i>

380
00:20:04,637 --> 00:20:06,937
Every hotel has
croissants for breakfast.

381
00:20:06,973 --> 00:20:09,643
I'll have it all ready for my
meeting with them on Wednesday.

382
00:20:09,676 --> 00:20:11,776
And stop worrying, I'll
knock it out of the park.

383
00:20:11,811 --> 00:20:13,781
Okay, okay.

384
00:20:13,813 --> 00:20:17,083
See? I can handle the
business and the contest.

385
00:20:17,116 --> 00:20:18,646
I can't believe
Sam Harper thinks I

386
00:20:18,685 --> 00:20:20,985
don't know what I'm
doing in the kitchen.

387
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:23,990
Honey, you don't know what
you're doing in the kitchen.

388
00:20:24,023 --> 00:20:28,763
Yeah, but he
doesn't know that.

389
00:20:28,795 --> 00:20:33,555
Just be careful okay? I know
he's cute and charming,

390
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:36,100
but he is his mother's son,

391
00:20:36,135 --> 00:20:38,965
and she's a snake
in the grass.

392
00:20:39,005 --> 00:20:41,965
Mom, I have a business
degree from Wharton.

393
00:20:42,008 --> 00:20:45,008
We had entire classes
on psychological warfare.

394
00:20:45,044 --> 00:20:48,184
I think I can handle
the likes of Sam Harper.

395
00:20:48,214 --> 00:20:50,554
Besides, this is
our family business,

396
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:52,523
and nothing is more
important to me.

397
00:20:52,552 --> 00:20:54,792
That's my girl.

398
00:21:07,166 --> 00:21:09,996
And... print.

399
00:21:15,508 --> 00:21:17,208
For the first round,
I will be making

400
00:21:17,243 --> 00:21:20,383
my mother's classic
pumpkin bread.

401
00:21:25,351 --> 00:21:28,691
That tastes like cement.

402
00:21:31,724 --> 00:21:33,094
<i> [Alarm ringing]</i>

403
00:21:33,126 --> 00:21:36,086
Oh, no no no.
Not again!

404
00:21:37,497 --> 00:21:39,827
[Coughing]

405
00:21:46,072 --> 00:21:49,112
<i> [Alarm ringing]</i>

406
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:56,080
[Coughing]

407
00:21:56,115 --> 00:21:58,345
Hello? Hello?

408
00:21:58,384 --> 00:22:01,594
[Fire extinguisher spraying]

409
00:22:09,429 --> 00:22:11,199
I see you found yourself
a baking pumpkin.

410
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:13,760
[Laughing]

411
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:16,500
<i> [Fire truck sirens]</i>

412
00:22:17,603 --> 00:22:20,443
Yes Captain, there will
not be a third time.

413
00:22:20,473 --> 00:22:21,813
Please, take this
back to the guys

414
00:22:21,841 --> 00:22:24,941
at the station.
On the house.

415
00:22:24,977 --> 00:22:27,607
You're doing great work.

416
00:22:30,283 --> 00:22:32,083
So, now you know.

417
00:22:32,118 --> 00:22:34,488
I'm a complete
disaster in the kitchen.

418
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:37,390
Uh... I just want to
make sure you're okay.

419
00:22:37,423 --> 00:22:40,423
I'm fine, the
bakery is fine.

420
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:42,530
And as much as it
might disappoint you,

421
00:22:42,562 --> 00:22:44,662
we will live to
see another day.

422
00:22:44,697 --> 00:22:46,327
Contrary to what you
might think of my family,

423
00:22:46,366 --> 00:22:48,126
we really don't
want anything bad

424
00:22:48,167 --> 00:22:49,167
to happen to
your business.

425
00:22:49,202 --> 00:22:50,942
In fact, it's nice
having the competition.

426
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:52,640
It keeps us on our toes.

427
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:54,972
To be honest with you I'm
even, sort of, looking

428
00:22:55,007 --> 00:22:57,937
to get out of the bakery
business altogether.

429
00:22:57,977 --> 00:22:59,737
Really?

430
00:22:59,779 --> 00:23:01,479
And do what?

431
00:23:01,514 --> 00:23:03,984
A full-service sit down
restaurant.

432
00:23:04,016 --> 00:23:05,276
That would serve
a family- friendly,

433
00:23:05,318 --> 00:23:09,018
American classic cuisine
with a gourmet flair.

434
00:23:09,055 --> 00:23:10,985
The Fuller Street
restaurant.

435
00:23:11,023 --> 00:23:12,793
It would just take a
few renovations.

436
00:23:12,825 --> 00:23:15,855
A new space, maybe.
I don't know.

437
00:23:15,895 --> 00:23:17,995
So what's the hold up?

438
00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:19,760
My mother, of course.

439
00:23:19,799 --> 00:23:21,799
I want her to think bigger,
but she's so concerned

440
00:23:21,834 --> 00:23:24,474
about the time, the
energy, the money.

441
00:23:24,504 --> 00:23:25,904
But more than
anything I think

442
00:23:25,938 --> 00:23:27,838
her whole life is
focused on the bakery.

443
00:23:27,874 --> 00:23:30,114
I guess she worries a restaurant
might interfere with it.

444
00:23:30,143 --> 00:23:32,843
Well, I hope you
can convince her.

445
00:23:32,879 --> 00:23:35,109
That way, people
would only come here

446
00:23:35,148 --> 00:23:38,018
for pastries and all
my problems would be solved.

447
00:23:38,050 --> 00:23:40,790
So things aren't
going so...

448
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:42,290
We're getting by.

449
00:23:42,321 --> 00:23:43,621
We've been there
as well.

450
00:23:43,656 --> 00:23:46,256
But I want to do more
than just get by.

451
00:23:46,292 --> 00:23:49,492
My mother and I have
an agreement of sorts.

452
00:23:49,529 --> 00:23:52,959
I win the contest and she'll
consider the proposal.

453
00:23:52,999 --> 00:23:54,799
What kind of proposal?

454
00:23:54,834 --> 00:23:56,834
Right now, it's just a
menu for the restaurant.

455
00:23:56,869 --> 00:23:58,939
But I'm working
on a business plan,

456
00:23:58,971 --> 00:24:01,711
which is taking
a little longer.

457
00:24:01,741 --> 00:24:04,211
The most important thing
I learned at Wharton

458
00:24:04,243 --> 00:24:06,913
was the difference
between an idea and a plan.

459
00:24:06,946 --> 00:24:10,606
Dreamers have ideas,
and doers have plans.

460
00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:12,820
The best advice I
can give you is...

461
00:24:12,852 --> 00:24:16,552
Map out every last detail,
from start to finish.

462
00:24:16,589 --> 00:24:18,719
Thanks, I'll do that.

463
00:24:18,758 --> 00:24:19,718
So what about you?

464
00:24:19,759 --> 00:24:23,329
What's your recipe for
the preliminary round?

465
00:24:23,362 --> 00:24:26,302
An idea or a plan?

466
00:24:26,332 --> 00:24:29,502
Well, first it was an
idea, then it was a plan.

467
00:24:29,535 --> 00:24:32,235
And now, it's bordering
on a colossal failure.

468
00:24:32,271 --> 00:24:34,841
Look at us...
what a pair.

469
00:24:34,874 --> 00:24:36,944
Yeah.

470
00:24:37,877 --> 00:24:41,277
Wait a minute! I got it!

471
00:24:41,314 --> 00:24:43,454
You need a viable
business proposal,

472
00:24:43,483 --> 00:24:45,323
something I can
do in my sleep,

473
00:24:45,351 --> 00:24:46,951
and with my mother
out of commission,

474
00:24:47,019 --> 00:24:49,749
I need someone to
teach me how to bake...

475
00:24:49,789 --> 00:24:52,159
without burning
down the town.

476
00:24:52,191 --> 00:24:54,461
You want me to
help you win?

477
00:24:54,494 --> 00:25:00,204
No, just help each other
get what we both want.

478
00:25:00,233 --> 00:25:02,873
Did I mentioned I
was top of my class?

479
00:25:02,902 --> 00:25:04,402
Do you know how
many job offers

480
00:25:04,437 --> 00:25:06,637
I had
after graduation?

481
00:25:06,672 --> 00:25:09,012
This feels a lot like
conspiring with the enemy.

482
00:25:09,041 --> 00:25:10,941
I won't tell if you don't.

483
00:25:12,411 --> 00:25:15,581
Alright, you've got
yourself a teacher.

484
00:25:23,689 --> 00:25:28,089
<i>So ten o'clock tonight. Text me</i>
<i> first to make sure I'm alone.</i>

485
00:25:28,127 --> 00:25:30,487
<i> My mother is failing miserably</i>
<i> at staying off her feet.</i>

486
00:25:30,530 --> 00:25:31,560
Got it.

487
00:25:31,597 --> 00:25:33,727
We have to be so careful,
Sam. I don't know about

488
00:25:33,766 --> 00:25:35,896
your mother, but mine will
practically disown me if

489
00:25:35,935 --> 00:25:38,235
she has any idea that we're
helping each other out.

490
00:25:38,271 --> 00:25:40,941
Oh, trust me, my
mother would as well.

491
00:25:40,973 --> 00:25:43,013
Okay, I'll see you at 10.

492
00:25:47,013 --> 00:25:49,983
Auntie Casey!

493
00:25:50,016 --> 00:25:52,976
Alisa, you're here!

494
00:25:53,019 --> 00:25:54,079
Oh I missed you!

495
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:55,920
I missed you too!

496
00:25:55,955 --> 00:25:56,945
Hi!

497
00:25:56,989 --> 00:25:58,759
Hi big sister!

498
00:25:58,791 --> 00:26:01,461
And you're
here... again!

499
00:26:01,494 --> 00:26:05,534
What? The baker filling
in for me called with

500
00:26:05,565 --> 00:26:07,625
some questions, so I had
Betty drive me over.

501
00:26:07,667 --> 00:26:09,667
She insisted. And
I was just home,

502
00:26:09,702 --> 00:26:12,242
working on my
bake-off recipe.

503
00:26:12,271 --> 00:26:14,741
I just might have a shot
this year with Faye and

504
00:26:14,774 --> 00:26:17,274
Lydia out of the mix.
Between those two, no one

505
00:26:17,310 --> 00:26:19,810
else has won that contest
in well over a decade.

506
00:26:19,845 --> 00:26:21,845
Well, that definitely
changes this year.

507
00:26:21,881 --> 00:26:24,521
Maybe we can get some other
things to change this year too.

508
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:25,350
Oh...

509
00:26:25,384 --> 00:26:27,554
It's no use, Betty.
I've tried.

510
00:26:27,587 --> 00:26:29,817
They're the Hatfields
and McCoys of Emeryville.

511
00:26:29,855 --> 00:26:32,285
Is it too much to ask
to want to have my

512
00:26:32,325 --> 00:26:33,485
good friends back
together again?

513
00:26:33,526 --> 00:26:34,786
Yes!

514
00:26:34,827 --> 00:26:37,127
And you know very
well, Mother, that you

515
00:26:37,163 --> 00:26:39,533
can answer questions
over the phone.

516
00:26:39,565 --> 00:26:40,895
I'm so bored at home.

517
00:26:40,933 --> 00:26:42,433
Why can't I
come in and help?

518
00:26:42,468 --> 00:26:44,098
Because the doctor said
if you keep standing

519
00:26:44,136 --> 00:26:47,296
on that foot you might
have permanent damage!

520
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:50,570
That's why. Now go home!

521
00:26:51,844 --> 00:26:54,284
Alright, fine. I know
when I'm not wanted.

522
00:26:54,313 --> 00:26:55,983
Muah! Bye, Lexi.

523
00:26:56,015 --> 00:26:57,475

Bye!

524
00:26:57,516 --> 00:26:58,346
Bye honey.

525
00:26:58,384 --> 00:27:00,584
Bye.

526
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:03,550
So, I have taken the week
off work, I am all yours.

527
00:27:03,589 --> 00:27:05,989
Although I may have to do a
little work while I'm here

528
00:27:06,025 --> 00:27:08,025
because I have a big case
coming up next month.

529
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:09,860
Thank you so much.
You have no idea

530

how much I need
you this week.

531

Are you kidding? You and
Sam Harper taking over

532
00:27:14,467 --> 00:27:17,467

miss this for the world!

533
00:27:17,503 --> 00:27:20,403
We're not "taking it over." We
just both happened to enter the

534
00:27:20,439 --> 00:27:22,709
bake-off for the first time
this year. That's all.

535
00:27:22,742 --> 00:27:25,512
But mom says if you win this
you're going to get featured

536
00:27:25,544 --> 00:27:28,584
on that Culinary show, "Pie
Heaven". That's pretty cool.

537
00:27:28,614 --> 00:27:31,324
Don't set your
DVR quite yet,

538
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:34,350
I'm a long way off
from winning anything.

539
00:27:34,387 --> 00:27:37,087
Oh Casey, you do so much
for this place. You know

540
00:27:37,123 --> 00:27:40,393
you don't have to take on
this contest on as well.

541
00:27:40,426 --> 00:27:42,226
You remember after I
graduated I could have

542
00:27:42,261 --> 00:27:45,361
moved away to work at that
big company in New York?

543
00:27:45,398 --> 00:27:51,568
I had a choice, but mom needed
me, so the choice was easy.

544
00:27:51,604 --> 00:27:55,614
I guess deep down I
really do love this place,

545
00:27:55,641 --> 00:27:57,111
and it's for
that very reason

546
00:27:57,143 --> 00:28:00,243
I do need to take
this contest on.

547
00:28:00,279 --> 00:28:02,009
Okay.

548
00:28:02,048 --> 00:28:03,248
I'm glad you're here.

I wish you a lot of luck.

We'll do each mix

554
00:28:27,173 --> 00:28:29,643
separately and then
blend them together.

555
00:28:29,675 --> 00:28:33,675
Okay. Got it. I think.

556
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:38,220
"Cooking should be entered into
with abandon, or not at all."

557
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:40,350
Julia Child said that.

558
00:28:40,386 --> 00:28:42,386
"If you're not going
to take it seriously,

559
00:28:42,421 --> 00:28:46,621

Faye McArthy said that.

560
00:28:46,659 --> 00:28:48,489
So how is it you
grew up in a

561
00:28:48,527 --> 00:28:49,787
bakery and never
learned to cook?

562
00:28:49,829 --> 00:28:51,399
I've always had more
of a propensity towards

563
00:28:51,430 --> 00:28:54,470
business and academics.
That's why I'm the brains

564
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:57,030
of The Sweet Factory and
my mother is the brawn.

565
00:28:57,069 --> 00:29:00,969
Okay Miss Academic, try this.
Treat the recipe like an

566
00:29:01,006 --> 00:29:05,406
equation. Follow the steps and
it won't steer you wrong.

567
00:29:05,444 --> 00:29:11,554
Actually I think cooking is more
of an art form. And art and I...

568
00:29:11,584 --> 00:29:14,724
we've always had this
love/hate sort of thing.

569
00:29:14,754 --> 00:29:20,594
It just takes practice.
You'll get it. Now, stir!

Let's mix the pumpkin.

574
00:29:33,839 --> 00:29:36,769
So how did you know this
was what you wanted to do?

575
00:29:36,809 --> 00:29:39,209
My grandma used to say:
"you want to show someone

576
00:29:39,245 --> 00:29:43,205
you care? Cook for them."
So that's what I do.

577
00:29:43,249 --> 00:29:44,749
Sometimes a plate
of chocolate chip

578
00:29:44,784 --> 00:29:46,184

you really need.

579
00:29:46,218 --> 00:29:48,388
And while the bakery has
been great, it's time for a

580
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:50,890
restaurant. Something with
community tables, where

581
00:29:50,923 --> 00:29:55,433
it's loud and busy and food
is served family style.

582
00:29:55,461 --> 00:29:58,301
Now, that is the perfect way
to mix if you want your bread

583
00:29:58,330 --> 00:30:01,400
to be clumpy and uneven. Is that
the texture you're going for?

584
00:30:01,433 --> 00:30:06,973
Of course, who doesn't
like clumpy bread.

585
00:30:07,006 --> 00:30:10,006
Okay, you go ahead,
show me the right way.

586
00:30:11,177 --> 00:30:12,277

587
00:30:12,311 --> 00:30:14,481

00:35:08,407 --> 00:35:09,907
Or woman... AHHHH!

674
00:35:09,942 --> 00:35:12,582
Or woman... Win.

675
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:23,390
Please. After
you. Please

676
00:35:39,271 --> 00:35:41,771
Alright, preliminary
round. How are we feeling?

677
00:35:41,807 --> 00:35:44,707
I'm nervous. What
if I mess up?

678
00:35:44,743 --> 00:35:48,043
Okay, listen. Your
big sister is about to

679
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:51,350
give you some very sound,
unsolicited advice.

680
00:35:51,383 --> 00:35:53,783
When I first started
college, what was my major?

681
00:35:53,819 --> 00:35:55,519
Pre-med, but if I
remember correctly,

682
00:35:55,554 --> 00:35:57,694
the sight of blood
made you faint.

683
00:35:57,723 --> 00:36:03,393
Every single time. In theory,
I loved medicine, in practice,

684
00:36:03,428 --> 00:36:06,258
it made me unconscious.
So I changed course.

685
00:36:06,298 --> 00:36:07,528
Yeah, to law.

686
00:36:07,566 --> 00:36:11,596
Exactly. It just spoke to me.
And then I ended up loving it.

687
00:36:11,637 --> 00:36:13,697
You need to find
what speaks to you.

688
00:36:13,739 --> 00:36:17,409
Yeah, but I already know.
It's this place. The bakery.

689
00:36:17,442 --> 00:36:20,642
That's what speaks to me and I
just want to do right by it.

690
00:36:20,679 --> 00:36:26,449
Then let that fuel you, and let
go! Have a little fun with it.

691
00:36:26,485 --> 00:36:28,745
Wait, cooking is
supposed to be fun?

692
00:36:28,787 --> 00:36:30,587
Yeah!

693
00:36:30,622 --> 00:36:32,692
Why didn't anybody
tell me that?

694
00:36:43,468 --> 00:36:46,098
Casey!

695
00:36:46,138 --> 00:36:48,308
Thanks, again, for helping
me out. I went over it

696
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:52,010
in detail last night.
Business plan is incredible.

697
00:36:52,044 --> 00:36:54,314
Well, just don't tell
anyone where you got it.

698
00:36:54,346 --> 00:36:55,906
Your secret's
safe with me.

699
00:36:55,948 --> 00:36:59,078
More importantly,
how are you feeling?

700
00:36:59,117 --> 00:37:01,417
I'm fluctuating between
terrified and being

701
00:37:01,453 --> 00:37:05,093
completely numb so...
all in all, not bad.

702
00:37:05,123 --> 00:37:06,593
Moment of truth.

703
00:37:06,625 --> 00:37:09,055
Okay, stop being nice to
me, people are looking.

704
00:37:09,094 --> 00:37:11,464
We should probably give
them what they want.

705
00:37:11,496 --> 00:37:13,856
It would make it worth
the price of admission.

706
00:37:13,899 --> 00:37:14,969
Let's do this!

707
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,830
You really think you're
going to the finals?

708
00:37:16,868 --> 00:37:18,798
Don't kid yourself Casey.

709
00:37:18,837 --> 00:37:22,167
You know what Sam? When I want
your opinion, I'll ask for it.

710
00:37:22,207 --> 00:37:25,207
You don't know everything, I
could teach you a few things.

711
00:37:25,244 --> 00:37:27,984
You don't need my opinion,
you know you're gonna lose!

712
00:37:28,013 --> 00:37:29,713
Can you believe this guy?

713
00:37:29,748 --> 00:37:32,048
It's never too late to
throw in the towel McArthy.

714

That's ok, why don't
you keep it since it

715
00:37:33,919 --> 00:37:35,549
looks like you're the
one who's sweating.

716

Are you two going to be
doing this the whole time?

What did he want?

777

He just wanted to
wish me luck.

00:41:25,116 --> 00:41:26,746
Uh huh.

00:41:26,785 --> 00:41:28,715

00:41:30,789 --> 00:41:32,119
So what did the
doctor say?

781
00:41:32,157 --> 00:41:34,787
Well, just two more
weeks on these things.

782
00:41:34,826 --> 00:41:36,786
On those things, or
off those things?

783
00:41:36,828 --> 00:41:39,698
Okay, he still wants
me to take it easy.

784
00:41:39,731 --> 00:41:41,631
But I wasn't going
to miss the prelims.

over the reins this year.

00:41:48,673 --> 00:41:52,313
What can I say? He's my
son and he wanted this.

Letting someone else take
center stage, Lydia?

Are you feeling okay or should
somebody call an ambulance?

00:41:59,284 --> 00:42:05,094
Hello Faye, I just heard
your bakery is in trouble!

792
00:42:05,123 --> 00:42:08,463
I just want you to know
that I feel I for you.

ready made pie crusts.

get the extra large?

00:42:35,287 --> 00:42:36,717

something we can do to

stop this fighting
between our mothers.

Having to hide
this forbidden

Is that what we have? A
forbidden friendship?

810
00:42:47,165 --> 00:42:49,765
You make it sound so illicit
when you say it like that.

811
00:42:49,801 --> 00:42:53,701
I don't know, it's kind of
fun having a secret with you.

And if I don't make
finals? Then what?

813
00:42:57,642 --> 00:43:00,542
Then I don't know.

814
00:43:00,579 --> 00:43:03,379
You go back to being a Harper
and I go back to being

a McArthy, where we happily
coexist in perfect disharmony.

00:44:38,176 --> 00:44:40,776
Casey McArthy of The
Sweet Factory!

843
00:44:40,812 --> 00:44:43,082
[Applause]

844
00:44:43,114 --> 00:44:44,914
Wonderful!

845
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:51,350
A new generation of
Harpers and McArthys going

846
00:44:51,389 --> 00:44:54,089
head-to-head in an
unbelievable showdown.

847
00:44:54,125 --> 00:44:56,225
This is going to be one
of the most exciting

848
00:44:56,261 --> 00:44:58,161
final rounds we have ever
seen at this competition.

849
00:44:58,196 --> 00:45:00,796
Hold on tight everyone,
because four days from now

850
00:45:00,832 --> 00:45:04,702
we will have a new
pumpkin pie champion.

851
00:45:04,736 --> 00:45:07,036
[Crowd cheering]

852
00:45:19,851 --> 00:45:22,391
You should be proud of
yourself. Why aren't you happy?

853
00:45:22,420 --> 00:45:25,890
I am happy. I was
just thinking that

854
00:45:25,924 --> 00:45:28,664
only one of us can win.
Come on!

855
00:45:30,795 --> 00:45:34,555
If I win what does
that mean for you?

856
00:45:34,599 --> 00:45:38,529
Well, I do have this spectacular
business plan that, if my mom

857
00:45:38,570 --> 00:45:42,210
can't see the potential, then
maybe some investors can.

858
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:45,140
And if you win, that could be
really bad for our family

859
00:45:45,176 --> 00:45:48,606
business. Especially if we
don't land this hotel account.

860
00:45:48,646 --> 00:45:50,046
You still haven't heard
back from them yet?

861
00:45:50,081 --> 00:45:53,181
No, nothing. I was really
hoping we would, so I

862
00:45:53,218 --> 00:45:55,788
wouldn't have to go
up against you.

863
00:45:55,820 --> 00:45:58,120
Don't you realize we're
part of a family feud?

864
00:45:58,156 --> 00:45:59,786
You're supposed
to despise me!

865
00:45:59,824 --> 00:46:02,064
I know. You're supposed to
be the competition in every

866
00:46:02,093 --> 00:46:04,793
sense of the word. Little do
they know, it was you that

867
00:46:04,829 --> 00:46:08,969
helped me into finals. Well,
you and my mother's recipe.

868
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:13,070
You got you to finals.
I was just the coach.

869
00:46:13,104 --> 00:46:15,744
Does that mean you're not done
yet? Because right now I only

870
00:46:15,774 --> 00:46:19,214
know how to make one dish,
and it's not a pumpkin pie.

871
00:46:19,244 --> 00:46:21,284
As far as I can see
it, we can either

872
00:46:21,312 --> 00:46:23,582
help each other or
hurt each other.

873
00:46:23,615 --> 00:46:26,045
Okay. I can help
you do a five year

874
00:46:26,084 --> 00:46:29,324
projection plan to further
entice your mother.

875
00:46:29,354 --> 00:46:31,654
Tomorrow night at
ten at the bakery?

876
00:46:31,689 --> 00:46:32,959
I'll bring the wine?

877
00:46:32,991 --> 00:46:37,331
It's a date!..
I mean... lesson.

878
00:46:37,362 --> 00:46:38,732
Let's go.

879
00:46:44,869 --> 00:46:46,669
<i> I said Jake, you</i>
<i> have to go to bed,</i>

880
00:46:46,704 --> 00:46:50,444
<i> You know what night this is</i>
<i> right? And he goes "Yeah."</i>

881
00:46:50,475 --> 00:46:51,935
[Laughing]

882
00:46:51,976 --> 00:46:55,176
Casey! Betty was just telling
me the funniest story

883
00:46:55,213 --> 00:46:57,783
about her son, Jake.
You remember Jake?

884
00:46:57,816 --> 00:46:58,776
Yeah!

885
00:46:58,817 --> 00:47:01,017
He's single...

886
00:47:01,052 --> 00:47:02,622
and he has a boat.

887
00:47:02,654 --> 00:47:04,524
Oh, that's great for him.

888
00:47:04,556 --> 00:47:07,356
Why don't you take the night
off honey, Your sister and I can

889
00:47:07,392 --> 00:47:12,132
close. You've been working so
hard, you need to take a break.

890
00:47:12,163 --> 00:47:16,933
Oh, yeah!
That sounds...

891
00:47:16,968 --> 00:47:18,898
I'd love a night off.

892
00:47:22,907 --> 00:47:25,977
You're so lucky to have each
other. And this wonderful

893
00:47:26,010 --> 00:47:31,850
business. My kids... well, I
don't hear from them much.

894
00:47:31,883 --> 00:47:34,253
I'm so blessed
these days...

895
00:47:52,437 --> 00:47:54,297
Did somebody order some
pumpkin moon pies?

896
00:47:54,339 --> 00:47:56,839
Hey! You read my mind.

897
00:47:56,875 --> 00:47:58,565
It's my superpower.

898
00:47:58,610 --> 00:48:01,910
Not to mention Mom told me
to drop them by on my way home.

899
00:48:01,946 --> 00:48:03,846
You want to stay for
dinner? I could uh...

900
00:48:03,882 --> 00:48:06,682
microwave something
marginally edible.

901
00:48:06,718 --> 00:48:10,348
While that does sound enticing,
No, I can't I have go home

902
00:48:10,388 --> 00:48:14,118
and practice my pie recipe. I
think I'll be at it all night.

903
00:48:14,158 --> 00:48:15,388
Are you using your
mother's recipes?

904
00:48:15,426 --> 00:48:18,256
No! I came up with one of
my own. Want to hear it?

905
00:48:18,296 --> 00:48:19,426
Yeah.

906
00:48:19,464 --> 00:48:22,574
Pumpkin silk chiffon pie,
with bourbon whipped cream.

907
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:25,270
I can't wait
to try that!

908
00:48:25,303 --> 00:48:27,903
Um... did you run
it by your mom?

909
00:48:27,939 --> 00:48:30,039
No, I sort of want
to surprise her.

910
00:48:30,074 --> 00:48:33,344
I want to show her that
I can do this on my own.

911
00:48:33,378 --> 00:48:36,378
She's so incredible in
the kitchen and, if this

912
00:48:36,414 --> 00:48:39,054
is my business too, then
I want her to know I can

913
00:48:39,083 --> 00:48:41,283
cover for her if she
ever needs me to.

914
00:48:41,319 --> 00:48:43,719
I have to tell you honey,
I'm really proud of you.

915
00:48:43,755 --> 00:48:46,255
Making it all the way
to the final round.

916
00:48:46,291 --> 00:48:49,491
Well, I haven't made a pie
yet so don't be too proud.

917
00:48:49,527 --> 00:48:51,587
I'm still a work
in progress.

918
00:48:51,629 --> 00:48:56,729
And getting every minute.
Now go make that pie!

919
00:48:56,768 --> 00:48:57,928
And save me a piece.

920
00:48:57,969 --> 00:48:59,539
I will.
I love you, Dad.

921
00:48:59,570 --> 00:49:01,770
Love you too!

922
00:49:10,014 --> 00:49:11,714
This would be
year five year?

923
00:49:11,749 --> 00:49:13,479
Yes, and I would be
conservative and

924
00:49:13,518 --> 00:49:16,788
estimate an 8-10 percent
growth, year over year.

925
00:49:16,821 --> 00:49:20,561
Then, minus the yearly
operating expenses.

926
00:49:20,591 --> 00:49:22,491
[Typing]

927
00:49:27,131 --> 00:49:29,001
Makes a nice profit.
Look at that.

928
00:49:29,033 --> 00:49:33,273
You got it! You just created
a five year projection plan.

929
00:49:33,304 --> 00:49:35,504
It's not complicated,
just follow

930
00:49:35,540 --> 00:49:38,770
the formula and it
never fails you.

931
00:49:38,810 --> 00:49:41,740
You really light up
when you talk numbers.

932
00:49:41,779 --> 00:49:45,609
It's my language.
No mistakes.

933
00:49:45,650 --> 00:49:51,450
True. But mistakes are not
always a bad thing. Sometimes

934
00:49:51,489 --> 00:49:57,159
they lead us to what we've
been looking for all along.

935
00:49:59,163 --> 00:50:03,803
It's how I came up with my fried
mac and goat cheese appetizer,

936
00:50:03,835 --> 00:50:07,265
and now It's going to be the
signature dish on my menu.

937
00:50:07,305 --> 00:50:10,665
Now that sounds delicious.

938
00:50:10,708 --> 00:50:13,678
You have no idea.

939
00:50:19,417 --> 00:50:20,947
[Oven timer dinging]

940
00:50:20,985 --> 00:50:24,715
And that would mean your very
first pie crust is ready.

941
00:50:43,107 --> 00:50:45,007
This is supposed to
be solid, right?

942
00:50:45,043 --> 00:50:46,843
Did you put enough
shortening?

943
00:50:46,878 --> 00:50:48,678
I think so?

944
00:50:48,713 --> 00:50:50,313
No worries, let's
try it again.

945
00:50:50,348 --> 00:50:54,018
Just take your time
and follow the steps.

946
00:50:54,052 --> 00:50:58,252
I don't know Sam, some people
aren't cut out for this.

947
00:50:58,289 --> 00:51:00,689
Those people don't
own a bakery.

948
00:51:00,725 --> 00:51:03,685
Listen to me, you've got my
business plan in great shape,

949
00:51:03,728 --> 00:51:06,298
so I owe you and we are
not leaving here until

950
00:51:06,330 --> 00:51:10,830
you make a solid pie crust.
Even if it takes all night.

951
00:51:10,868 --> 00:51:14,538
[Laughing]

952
00:51:14,572 --> 00:51:16,072
Deal.

953
00:51:16,107 --> 00:51:17,737
Round two.

954
00:51:25,483 --> 00:51:27,053
I didn't realize
what time it was.

955
00:51:27,085 --> 00:51:30,115
I need to get started
on the morning baking.

956
00:51:34,092 --> 00:51:35,892
Thanks for not
giving up on me.

957
00:51:35,927 --> 00:51:39,427
No, thank you. I feel like
I'm one step closer to

958
00:51:39,464 --> 00:51:42,834
not being my mother's
employee anymore.

959
00:51:44,535 --> 00:51:46,095
Bye.

960
00:51:46,137 --> 00:51:48,667
[Male voices talking]

961
00:51:48,706 --> 00:51:51,706
[Laughing]

962
00:51:51,742 --> 00:51:53,482
Dad?

963
00:51:53,511 --> 00:51:54,081
Casey?

964
00:51:54,112 --> 00:51:54,982
Dad!

965
00:51:55,012 --> 00:51:56,912
Sam!

966
00:52:01,319 --> 00:52:04,789
...and I wasn't about to
give up my golf buddy.

967
00:52:04,822 --> 00:52:07,262
So, for almost ten years
we've been sneaking off,

968
00:52:07,291 --> 00:52:10,061
twice a month, to
play in Green Point.

969
00:52:10,094 --> 00:52:13,404
We've tried, and failed, to
patch this rift for years.

970
00:52:13,431 --> 00:52:15,731
I don't understand why they
won't even hear each other out.

971
00:52:15,766 --> 00:52:19,266
Sometimes an argument takes on a
life of its own. So, in order

972
00:52:19,303 --> 00:52:22,573
to stay out of the mess,
we've had to resort to this.

973
00:52:22,607 --> 00:52:25,467
Usually we're here when
it's still dark, but I

974
00:52:25,510 --> 00:52:28,510
was running late this
morning. and lo and behold,

975
00:52:28,546 --> 00:52:31,476
we run into you two,
also sneaking around.

976
00:52:31,516 --> 00:52:34,416
Oh, this is not what
it seems, we're just

977
00:52:34,452 --> 00:52:38,122
helping each other out.
This is completely innocent.

978
00:52:38,156 --> 00:52:40,156
But you have to
keep this a secret.

979
00:52:40,191 --> 00:52:44,691
That means you
can't tell anybody.

980
00:52:46,964 --> 00:52:50,204
You don't tell our secret,
we won't tell yours.

981
00:53:05,449 --> 00:53:07,779
Well, let's call them!

982
00:53:07,818 --> 00:53:09,948
It's only been a few
days since the meeting.

983
00:53:09,987 --> 00:53:12,447
I don't want them to think
that we're desperate.

984
00:53:12,490 --> 00:53:15,590
I'm just concerned,
Casey. Business has never

985
00:53:15,626 --> 00:53:19,196
been this slow. We really
need this hotel account.

986
00:53:19,230 --> 00:53:22,160
That's why I'm just
going win the bake-off.

987
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:25,230
Now that my foot is better, let
me help you with your recipe?

988
00:53:25,269 --> 00:53:28,539
No, I'm good and you
are going to love it.

989
00:53:28,573 --> 00:53:30,043
I'm pulling out
all the stops.

990
00:53:30,074 --> 00:53:32,214
But this is my thing,
Casey. I don't

991
00:53:32,243 --> 00:53:34,013
know why you won't
let me help you.

992
00:53:34,045 --> 00:53:36,545
Because you need to take
it easy, and I need to

993
00:53:36,581 --> 00:53:40,481
prove to myself, and to you,
that I can do this alone.

994
00:53:43,354 --> 00:53:45,554
What? You don't think
I can win, do you?

995
00:53:45,590 --> 00:53:46,890
I never said that!

996
00:53:46,924 --> 00:53:48,964
Mom, I made it to the
finals, On my own.

997
00:53:48,993 --> 00:53:52,333
I know that, Casey, but let's
be honest. Baking just isn't--

998
00:53:52,363 --> 00:53:54,303
Don't you that
think this place is

999
00:53:54,332 --> 00:53:56,732
just as important
to me as it to you?

1000
00:53:56,767 --> 00:53:57,667
Yes!

1001
00:53:57,702 --> 00:53:59,872
Great. Well, then
if you can't support

1002
00:53:59,904 --> 00:54:02,144
me in this now,
then I'll just quit!

1003
00:54:02,173 --> 00:54:08,243
Wha-- Ok, ok! I'm
sorry. I support you!

1004
00:54:08,279 --> 00:54:09,749
What happened?

1005
00:54:24,795 --> 00:54:27,425
Hi!
Come in.

1006
00:54:30,601 --> 00:54:31,531
Hey!

1007

expense of losing myself.

1171
01:04:36,673 --> 01:04:39,243
If sharing a steamy
glance across a pumpkin

1172
01:04:39,276 --> 01:04:42,476
table is being obvious,
then yes, it was.

1173
01:04:42,512 --> 01:04:46,412
Sorry, I'll be
more careful.

1174
01:04:48,385 --> 01:04:51,885
Look at Lydia Harper,
she's just staring at Mom.

1175
01:04:51,922 --> 01:04:54,392
It's kind of sad really. They
used to be such good friends.

1176
01:04:54,424 --> 01:04:58,234
All three of them. I wish they
would have worked things out.

1177
01:04:58,262 --> 01:05:00,332
You can't save
everyone, Case.

1178
01:05:00,364 --> 01:05:02,834
I'm not trying
to save everyone.

1179
01:05:02,866 --> 01:05:05,326
Okay, maybe a
few people.

1180
01:05:05,369 --> 01:05:09,939
Don't stress about this
contest. Just do your best.

1181
01:05:09,973 --> 01:05:12,013
Things will work out the
way they're supposed to.

1182
01:05:12,042 --> 01:05:13,642
What will be, will be.

1183
01:05:13,677 --> 01:05:15,477
[<i> Cell phone vibrating</i> ]

1184
01:05:21,785 --> 01:05:23,785
I'll be right back.

1185
01:05:30,661 --> 01:05:31,831
Hi.

1186
01:05:33,730 --> 01:05:36,600
I've been waiting
to do that all day.

1187
01:05:36,633 --> 01:05:38,333
What are you
thinking about?

1188
01:05:38,368 --> 01:05:39,938
Something my sister said.

1189
01:05:39,970 --> 01:05:41,300
What's that?

1190
01:05:41,338 --> 01:05:43,868
That everything's gonna work
out the way it's supposed to.

1191
01:05:43,907 --> 01:05:46,107
Does that include
what happens to us?

1192
01:05:46,143 --> 01:05:47,913
I certainly hope so.
But all of this sneaking

1193
01:05:47,945 --> 01:05:50,675
around is really
making me anxious.

1194
01:05:50,714 --> 01:05:53,214
How about this, we keep
our secret for a little

1195
01:05:53,250 --> 01:05:55,050
bit longer and then,
after the bake-off,

1196
01:05:55,085 --> 01:05:57,585
we'll figure out how
to make this work.

1197
01:05:57,621 --> 01:05:59,291
Okay.

1198
01:06:00,791 --> 01:06:02,161
Okay, let's go.

1199
01:06:09,333 --> 01:06:11,203
So, what is it like?
Because according

1200
01:06:11,234 --> 01:06:13,904
to Betty, you were
kissing Sam Harper.

1201
01:06:13,937 --> 01:06:16,137
I think Betty should
mind her own business.

1202
01:06:16,173 --> 01:06:20,143
I knew it. You are trying to
send me to an early grave.

1203
01:06:20,177 --> 01:06:23,477
He's a Harper. The son of
the woman who betrayed me.

1204
01:06:23,513 --> 01:06:24,753
Let's not forget
that woman used

1205
01:06:24,781 --> 01:06:25,981
to be your best
friend Faye.

1206
01:06:26,016 --> 01:06:27,916
Reggie, don't
even start.

1207
01:06:27,951 --> 01:06:30,091
How could you be
so naive Casey?

1208
01:06:30,120 --> 01:06:32,150
Conspiring with
the enemy?

1209
01:06:32,189 --> 01:06:35,659
Enemy? Mom please.
He's been helping me.

1210
01:06:35,692 --> 01:06:37,732
He's the one who
got me to finals.

1211
01:06:37,761 --> 01:06:41,261
Then he's got an angle.
Harpers always have angles.

1212
01:06:41,298 --> 01:06:42,928
They're very
good at that.

1213
01:06:42,966 --> 01:06:46,326
It's been ten years, Mom. When
are you going to let this go?

1214
01:06:46,370 --> 01:06:49,670
Don't you dare turn this
around on me, Casey McArthy.

1215
01:06:49,706 --> 01:06:52,306
You did this.

1216
01:06:53,510 --> 01:06:55,110
Could she be
more dramatic?

1217
01:06:55,145 --> 01:06:59,075
She just needs to cool
off. She'll come around.

1218
01:06:59,116 --> 01:07:03,146
No, she won't.

1219
01:07:03,186 --> 01:07:04,746
You could be right.

1220
01:07:04,788 --> 01:07:06,518
Hundreds of women in
this town to choose

1221
01:07:06,556 --> 01:07:07,986
from and that's the
one you pick?

1222
01:07:08,025 --> 01:07:09,385
She's not who you
think she is.

1223
01:07:09,426 --> 01:07:10,826
She is taking
advantage of you, Sam.

1224
01:07:10,861 --> 01:07:12,761
Distracting you from keeping
your eye on the prize.

1225
01:07:12,796 --> 01:07:14,696
You make her sound
like some kind of spy.

1226
01:07:14,731 --> 01:07:16,801
Well, I wouldn't
put it past her.

1227
01:07:16,833 --> 01:07:18,673
I'm sure her mother
put her up to this.

1228
01:07:18,702 --> 01:07:20,572
Mom, nothing is more
important to me

1229
01:07:20,604 --> 01:07:23,204
than opening my
restaurant. Nothing.

1230
01:07:23,240 --> 01:07:26,470
Do you really think I would do
anything to jeopardize that?

1231
01:07:26,510 --> 01:07:29,140
Wait'll you see the business
plan I've developed.

1232
01:07:29,179 --> 01:07:30,209
Casey
helped me.

1233
01:07:30,247 --> 01:07:34,647
So this whole Casey
thing is strategy?

1234
01:07:34,684 --> 01:07:37,694
Like, keep your friends close
and your enemies closer.

1235
01:07:37,721 --> 01:07:38,921
Well, I mean...

1236
01:07:38,955 --> 01:07:44,385
Okay, I like it. All's fair
in love and pie, right?

1237
01:07:48,832 --> 01:07:51,832
So I'm a strategy?

1238
01:07:51,868 --> 01:07:55,068
That's not exactly what he said.
Maybe he was just trying to

1239
01:07:55,105 --> 01:07:58,765
appease his mother, but
it seemed that way, anyway.

1240
01:07:58,809 --> 01:08:01,439
I'll tell you right now,
he cannot be trusted.

1241
01:08:01,478 --> 01:08:05,408
That family's motto is
"Win at any cost."

1242
01:08:05,449 --> 01:08:08,919
It doesn't make any sense.
He just... he seemed so...

1243
01:08:08,952 --> 01:08:12,092
Convincing? Charming?

1244
01:08:12,122 --> 01:08:14,562
Distracting!?

1245
01:08:14,591 --> 01:08:16,091
Genuine.

1246
01:08:16,126 --> 01:08:17,756
You need to go
talk to him.

1247
01:08:17,794 --> 01:08:18,764
No, she doesn't.

1248
01:08:18,795 --> 01:08:20,025
Yes, she does.

1249
01:08:20,063 --> 01:08:21,433
Whose side are you on?

1250
01:08:21,465 --> 01:08:23,355
I am on the
side of love.

1251
01:08:23,400 --> 01:08:26,100
That's the cheesiest
thing you've ever said.

1252
01:08:26,136 --> 01:08:30,066
Love?! You're not in love
with that kid are you?

1253
01:08:30,107 --> 01:08:33,877
Mom! It's been less
than two weeks.

1254
01:08:33,910 --> 01:08:36,610
No one falls in
love that fast.

1255
01:08:36,646 --> 01:08:38,246
I think...

1256
01:08:38,281 --> 01:08:40,721
Do you have any idea
where he can be?

1257
01:08:40,750 --> 01:08:44,220
If I had to guess? Probably
watching the game at O'Malleys.

1258
01:08:44,254 --> 01:08:47,264
Then you go talk to him.
Mom and I can close up.

1259
01:08:47,290 --> 01:08:48,420
What's the matter
with you--

1260
01:08:48,458 --> 01:08:50,358
We can close up.

1261
01:09:00,971 --> 01:09:03,771
What are you doing here?
People are going to see us.

1262
01:09:03,807 --> 01:09:05,767
What does it matter?
Cat's out of the

1263
01:09:05,809 --> 01:09:08,509
bag anyway, thanks to
big-mouth Betty.

1264
01:09:08,545 --> 01:09:10,575
Yeah. My mother
was furious.

1265
01:09:10,614 --> 01:09:15,354
Really? And what did you
tell her? About me, about us?

1266
01:09:15,385 --> 01:09:18,185
I... didn't have a chance
to explain everything.

1267
01:09:18,221 --> 01:09:21,861
I know, my sister overheard
your conversation.

1268
01:09:21,892 --> 01:09:24,792
Something about me
being a strategy?

1269
01:09:24,828 --> 01:09:26,628
Wait a minute, are you
accusing me of something?

1270
01:09:26,663 --> 01:09:30,173
No, I'm asking you. Was
this some big plot?

1271
01:09:30,200 --> 01:09:35,470
Casey, no. She misunderstood
me. I swear to you.

1272
01:09:35,505 --> 01:09:37,405
Then why didn't you
correct her then?

1273
01:09:37,440 --> 01:09:40,580
My mom can be very irrational
when she wants to be.

1274
01:09:40,610 --> 01:09:43,980
I was just trying
to calm her down.

1275
01:09:44,014 --> 01:09:48,554
I don't know Sam, maybe
this isn't meant to be.

1276
01:09:48,585 --> 01:09:51,785
I know you don't
believe that, Casey.

1277
01:09:51,821 --> 01:09:53,621
We bring out the
best in each other.

1278
01:09:53,657 --> 01:09:56,557
Listen, we've come this far. Our
pie recipes are winners and one

1279
01:09:56,593 --> 01:09:58,693
of us is going to take
this thing home tomorrow.

1280
01:09:58,728 --> 01:09:59,828
Let's just see it through.

1281
01:09:59,863 --> 01:10:04,303
Hey, how come you two
aren't on the local news?

1282
01:10:06,203 --> 01:10:07,203
Can you turn it up?

1283
01:10:07,237 --> 01:10:08,467
<i> ...here to show</i>
<i> what kind of pie we</i>

1284
01:10:08,505 --> 01:10:09,895
<i> have to look </i>
<i> forward to tomorrow.</i>

1285
01:10:09,940 --> 01:10:13,410
I have invented the
most divine pumpkin

1286
01:10:13,443 --> 01:10:17,683
silk chiffon pie with
bourbon whipped cream.

1287
01:10:17,714 --> 01:10:19,014
What? That's my pie!

1288
01:10:19,049 --> 01:10:22,179
And a ginger snap
streusel crust.

1289
01:10:22,219 --> 01:10:23,419
And that's my crust!

1290
01:10:23,453 --> 01:10:24,753
<i> Mmm. Delicious!</i>

1291
01:10:24,788 --> 01:10:27,018
Oh, it will be!

1292
01:10:27,057 --> 01:10:30,557
So, sweet little Betty
isn't so sweet after all.

1293
01:10:30,594 --> 01:10:32,864
So, what do we do?

1294
01:10:32,896 --> 01:10:34,096
You know what?

1295
01:10:34,130 --> 01:10:35,260
Working with you this past
week,

1296
01:10:35,298 --> 01:10:37,098
I've realized something
very important.

1297
01:10:37,133 --> 01:10:38,803
Something my mother
never understood.

1298
01:10:38,835 --> 01:10:40,435
What's that?

1299
01:10:40,470 --> 01:10:45,040
You can create something unique
for yourself with a partner.

1300
01:10:45,075 --> 01:10:46,535
I'm listening.

1301
01:10:46,576 --> 01:10:48,736
We're going to
see your mother.

1302
01:10:51,781 --> 01:10:53,581
Come on!

1303
01:10:55,285 --> 01:10:58,785
There's no way. Betty would
never do something like that.

1304
01:10:58,822 --> 01:11:00,192
Think about it, Mom.

1305
01:11:00,223 --> 01:11:01,963
She could never
beat you and Lydia.

1306
01:11:01,992 --> 01:11:05,562
But me and Sam? She saw
an opening and she took it.

1307
01:11:05,595 --> 01:11:08,095
She thinks she can
win with our recipe.

1308
01:11:08,131 --> 01:11:09,561
But she's my friend.

1309
01:11:09,599 --> 01:11:12,629
No she's not, Mom. She's an
opportunist with zero medals

1310
01:11:12,669 --> 01:11:15,139
under her belt. That's
all that matters to her.

1311
01:11:15,171 --> 01:11:16,571
So, now what do we do?

1312
01:11:16,606 --> 01:11:18,206
You can't use
your recipe,

1313
01:11:18,241 --> 01:11:19,411
and you can't use
your pie crust.

1314
01:11:19,442 --> 01:11:21,482
It's been all over
the local news.

1315
01:11:21,511 --> 01:11:23,981
They'll think you
stole it from her.

1316
01:11:24,014 --> 01:11:26,114
We have a plan.

1317
01:11:26,149 --> 01:11:28,119
What?

1318
01:11:28,151 --> 01:11:30,151
We all need to
go see my mom.

1319
01:11:30,186 --> 01:11:31,916
Oh, ha ha ha.

1320
01:11:31,955 --> 01:11:35,615
Mom, if you won't do it for
the bakery, do it for me.

1321
01:11:39,529 --> 01:11:41,659
Sheesh!

1322
01:11:44,034 --> 01:11:46,834
Mom? Are you here?

1323
01:11:46,870 --> 01:11:48,800
<i> Coming!</i>

1324
01:11:54,144 --> 01:11:58,714
Mom, stop. We need to talk
to you, it's important.

1325
01:12:00,050 --> 01:12:02,780
Lydia, it's
about Betty.

1326
01:12:05,655 --> 01:12:08,285
So, how did Betty
get your recipe?

1327
01:12:08,325 --> 01:12:09,855
She came into the
bakery and I guess

1328
01:12:09,893 --> 01:12:11,793
when she excused herself
to use the bathroom,

1329
01:12:11,828 --> 01:12:13,288
she must've seen it
on the kitchen counter.

1330
01:12:13,330 --> 01:12:15,800
It never even occurred
to me that I should hide it.

1331
01:12:15,832 --> 01:12:19,802
Really? I always hide
mine in the store safe.

1332
01:12:19,836 --> 01:12:24,236
As do I! You never know how
far the competition will go.

1333
01:12:24,274 --> 01:12:25,874
Alright, take
it easy you two.

1334
01:12:25,909 --> 01:12:29,679
Well, I may have mentioned the
ginger snap streusel crust to

1335
01:12:29,713 --> 01:12:33,353
her at some point but...
it's Betty. She's my friend.

1336
01:12:33,383 --> 01:12:38,293
Well, sometimes friends
betray you, so...

1337
01:12:38,321 --> 01:12:40,221
So how does all
this affect us?

1338
01:12:40,256 --> 01:12:44,286
You guys used to spend a lot of
time here, baking. Together.

1339
01:12:44,327 --> 01:12:46,227
That's ancient
history, honey.

1340
01:12:46,262 --> 01:12:49,662
Look, we have a plan, but
we need you both on board.

1341
01:12:49,699 --> 01:12:52,329
Come on, can you put
your differences aside?

1342
01:12:52,369 --> 01:12:54,099
This is for
our businesses.

1343
01:12:54,137 --> 01:12:57,067
Yes, but only one of our
businesses can win so...

1344
01:12:57,107 --> 01:13:00,167
Not necessarily, but
you'll have to trust us.

1345
01:13:00,210 --> 01:13:02,440
Are you in?

1346
01:13:11,855 --> 01:13:16,285
Okay then. It all starts
with one pumpkin pie.

1347
01:13:23,633 --> 01:13:25,603
<i> We enter as a team.</i>
<i> There's nothing in the</i>

1348
01:13:25,635 --> 01:13:27,565
<i> by-laws that says we</i>
<i> can't join forces since</i>

1349
01:13:27,604 --> 01:13:30,574
<i> we've both qualified</i>
<i> for the final round.</i>

1350
01:13:32,142 --> 01:13:34,782
<i> Which is where you come in. We</i>
<i> have 12 hours and we need</i>

1351
01:13:34,811 --> 01:13:36,681
<i> your help to come up</i>
<i> with a pumpkin pie</i>

1352
01:13:36,713 --> 01:13:38,553
<i> to put all other</i>
<i> pies to shame.</i>

1353
01:13:38,581 --> 01:13:42,081
<i> And no one does</i>
<i> that better than you two.</i>

1354
01:14:05,041 --> 01:14:06,711
I have an idea.

1355
01:14:08,978 --> 01:14:10,648
Sam. Pecans.

1356
01:14:42,045 --> 01:14:44,505
Faye.

1357
01:14:44,547 --> 01:14:49,147
Can we take a minute?
This may be long overdue,

1358
01:14:49,185 --> 01:14:51,845
but I feel I
owe you an apology.

1359
01:14:51,888 --> 01:14:53,688
Lydia, let's just finish
helping the kids...

1360
01:14:53,723 --> 01:14:57,493
Will you please just...
just let me finish?

1361
01:14:57,527 --> 01:15:02,297
I need to get this
off my chest.

1362
01:15:02,332 --> 01:15:06,172
I should've fought for you
with my father, but I didn't.

1363
01:15:06,202 --> 01:15:10,512
It's just... you're so
good at this, Faye.

1364
01:15:10,540 --> 01:15:13,370
You've always been better
in the kitchen than me.

1365
01:15:13,409 --> 01:15:15,079
I guess I...

1366
01:15:15,111 --> 01:15:18,551
I just didn't want to live
in your shadow anymore.

1367
01:15:18,581 --> 01:15:21,351
What are you
talking about?

1368
01:15:21,384 --> 01:15:23,924
You've got more
bake-off wins than me.

1369
01:15:23,953 --> 01:15:26,153
You were always
prettier and...

1370
01:15:26,189 --> 01:15:29,219
the more popular
girl in school.

1371
01:15:29,259 --> 01:15:31,559
You were never
in my shadow.

1372
01:15:31,594 --> 01:15:33,864
If anything, it was
the other way around.

1373
01:15:33,897 --> 01:15:36,857
That's where you're wrong.

1374
01:15:36,900 --> 01:15:40,540
I've always been
insecure around you.

1375
01:15:40,570 --> 01:15:42,770
The only way I was able
to beat you all these years

1376
01:15:42,805 --> 01:15:47,575
was by practically
living in the bakery.

1377
01:15:47,610 --> 01:15:51,650
And that nearly
ruined my marriage.

1378
01:15:53,383 --> 01:15:56,183
In the end...

1379
01:15:56,219 --> 01:16:02,059
I guess I just wanted to prove
to you that I could do it.

1380
01:16:02,091 --> 01:16:05,691
Well, I wish you hadn't waited
10 years to tell me all that.

1381
01:16:05,728 --> 01:16:09,498
I never wanted this to
go on as long as it did.

1382
01:16:09,532 --> 01:16:12,572
Me neither.

1383
01:16:12,602 --> 01:16:15,002
But you know,
in some strange way,

1384
01:16:15,038 --> 01:16:18,768
I think we kind of
helped each other.

1385
01:16:18,808 --> 01:16:21,478
It sounds like I was
the motivation for you

1386
01:16:21,511 --> 01:16:23,611
to become a better
baker, and you certainly

1387
01:16:23,646 --> 01:16:27,376
motivated me to start
my own business.

1388
01:16:27,417 --> 01:16:30,377
I'm sorry Faye.

1389
01:16:30,420 --> 01:16:32,190
Me too.

1390
01:16:33,656 --> 01:16:34,856
A fresh start?

1391
01:16:34,891 --> 01:16:36,921
Absolutely.

1392
01:16:39,162 --> 01:16:43,032
Now, will you finally
give me the recipe

1393
01:16:43,066 --> 01:16:44,266
for your pumpkin scones?

1394
01:16:44,300 --> 01:16:46,730
Let's not get crazy.

1395
01:16:52,675 --> 01:16:54,775
Tell me I'm not dreaming.

1396
01:16:54,811 --> 01:16:58,481
Nope, looks like the cold
war has finally ended.

1397
01:17:15,031 --> 01:17:17,231
This is the one.

1398
01:17:17,266 --> 01:17:21,166
Pumpkin cheesecake pie
with a pecan caramel topping.

1399
01:17:21,204 --> 01:17:23,274
It's perfect.

1400
01:17:23,306 --> 01:17:26,936
Now you're going to have to
recreate it at the festival.

1401
01:17:26,976 --> 01:17:29,476
And you only get one shot.

1402
01:17:29,512 --> 01:17:32,112
I have worked out
every last detail.

1403
01:17:32,148 --> 01:17:34,618
It's what she does.

1404
01:17:34,651 --> 01:17:39,321
Ok guys, let's do this.

1405
01:17:53,870 --> 01:17:57,370
<i> [Applause]</i>

1406
01:18:11,320 --> 01:18:14,990
Oh, no. Did someone drop
out of the competition?

1407
01:18:15,024 --> 01:18:17,794
No. As a matter of fact,
Betty, two of your competitors

1408
01:18:17,827 --> 01:18:21,397
have decided to compete in
the final round as a team.

1409
01:18:21,431 --> 01:18:23,431
I don't mean
to be difficult,

1410
01:18:23,466 --> 01:18:25,996
but isn't that
against the rules?

1411
01:18:26,035 --> 01:18:28,665
That's what I thought, so I ran
it by the contest officials

1412
01:18:28,705 --> 01:18:31,365
and you're not going to
believe what they said.

1413
01:18:31,407 --> 01:18:33,867
It's completely legal.

1414
01:18:37,413 --> 01:18:40,313
Okay. Great.

1415
01:18:40,349 --> 01:18:42,879
Makes it all the more
interesting, right?

1416
01:18:42,919 --> 01:18:44,389
Sure does!

1417
01:18:44,420 --> 01:18:46,550
<i> [Applause]</i>

1418
01:18:50,960 --> 01:18:56,200
That's 60 minutes to bake and
the clock... starts... now!

1419
01:19:06,075 --> 01:19:07,735
Betty has my recipe.

1420
01:19:07,777 --> 01:19:09,577
Yeah, I know. We
knew this already.

1421
01:19:09,612 --> 01:19:12,052
No I mean, a picture
of my actual recipe

1422
01:19:12,081 --> 01:19:14,551
in my handwriting
on her tablet.

1423
01:19:14,584 --> 01:19:17,354
So she didn't just copy the
idea, she took a photo of it?

1424
01:19:17,386 --> 01:19:18,186
Yes!

1425
01:19:18,221 --> 01:19:19,551
Do you still have
your copy of it?

1426
01:19:19,589 --> 01:19:21,189
Of course I do,
it's in my bag.

1427
01:19:21,224 --> 01:19:25,064
Then we're going to make this a
festival they'll never forget.

1428
01:19:25,094 --> 01:19:28,164
Betty's going down.

1429
01:19:32,635 --> 01:19:36,065
Pumpkin cheesecake pie with
a caramel pecan topping.

1430
01:19:36,105 --> 01:19:38,335
<i> [Applause]</i>

1431
01:19:43,613 --> 01:19:47,553
Pumpkin silk chiffon pie,
with bourbon whipped cream

1432
01:19:47,583 --> 01:19:50,253
and a ginger snap
streusel crust.

1433
01:19:50,286 --> 01:19:53,086
<i> [Applause]</i>

1434
01:19:54,824 --> 01:19:58,134
Can I maybe have
one moment?

1435
01:19:58,161 --> 01:20:00,291
Betty, that sounds amazing!

1436
01:20:00,329 --> 01:20:02,559
How did you ever come up
with a recipe like that?

1437
01:20:02,598 --> 01:20:06,068
I... just years of
experience I guess.

1438
01:20:06,102 --> 01:20:11,172
Really? And that's your recipe
right there on the screen?

1439
01:20:11,207 --> 01:20:12,167
Of course!

1440
01:20:12,208 --> 01:20:15,508
In your handwriting?

1441
01:20:15,545 --> 01:20:18,775
That's weird, because
I have the same exact

1442
01:20:18,815 --> 01:20:21,945
one in my handwriting!
Could it be that

1443
01:20:21,984 --> 01:20:25,294
I have the original and
you took a photo of it?

1444
01:20:25,321 --> 01:20:27,191
<i> [Crowd gasping]</i>

1445
01:20:28,758 --> 01:20:30,718
Please tell me you're
getting all of this.

1446
01:20:30,760 --> 01:20:33,160
Yeah, me and about
100 other people.

1447
01:20:33,196 --> 01:20:35,496
That's not true!

1448
01:20:36,365 --> 01:20:37,825
Is that true, Betty?

1449
01:20:37,867 --> 01:20:41,667
Of... of course not,
Bob. You... you know me!

1450
01:20:41,704 --> 01:20:43,704
You all know me.

1451
01:20:43,739 --> 01:20:47,369
Then you won't mind doing a
handwriting sample for us.

1452
01:20:52,114 --> 01:20:57,854
I just wanted to
win. One time!

1453
01:20:57,887 --> 01:21:00,247
Is that too
much to ask?

1454
01:21:02,425 --> 01:21:05,985
Due to the disqualification,
this is the only entry,

1455
01:21:06,028 --> 01:21:07,898
and you know what
that means...

1456
01:21:07,930 --> 01:21:10,660
Congratulations Sam Harper
and Casey McArthy!

1457

[Crowd cheering]

01:21:21,644 --> 01:21:24,214
I'm not sure if you're aware
of this, but it's customary

1461
01:21:24,247 --> 01:21:26,647
for the winners to kiss
in front of the crowd.

1462
01:21:26,682 --> 01:21:28,722
Did you make that
up Mr. Harper?

1463
01:21:28,751 --> 01:21:31,121
Absolutely, Miss McArthy.

Is it slowing down
out there yet?

1466
01:22:00,850 --> 01:22:03,150
Unfortunately no. Oh Sam,
there's some customers

1467
01:22:03,185 --> 01:22:06,085
who want to pay their
compliments to the chef.

1468

Table six, please.

1469
01:22:24,473 --> 01:22:28,043
You two! Back again? That's
the third time this week.

1470
01:22:28,077 --> 01:22:30,477
What can I say?
The food is great!

1471
01:22:30,513 --> 01:22:33,653
Yeah, and we can't
complain about the prices.

1472
01:22:33,683 --> 01:22:35,383
We're going to have to start
charging you, you know.

1473
01:22:35,418 --> 01:22:36,818
They're eating
away our profits!

1474
01:22:36,852 --> 01:22:39,252
Careful, you're starting to
sound like your mother.

1475
01:22:39,322 --> 01:22:42,192
I'll take that
as a compliment.

1476
01:22:43,526 --> 01:22:46,026
Ah, good choice!

1477
01:22:47,930 --> 01:22:50,100
Thank you.

Half dozen pumpkin scones,
fresh from the oven.

1479
01:22:53,202 --> 01:22:56,672
Baked by the one and
only Lydia Harper.

1480
01:22:56,706 --> 01:22:59,506
Enjoy!

1481
01:23:02,712 --> 01:23:04,482
Not bad, Mrs. Harper.

1482
01:23:04,513 --> 01:23:08,023
Not bad at all,
Mr. Harper.
