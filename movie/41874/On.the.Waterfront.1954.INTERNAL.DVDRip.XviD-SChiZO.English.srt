2
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:58,510
Now you take it easy, slugger.

3
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:15,360
Joey!

4
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:21,570
Joe Doyle!

5
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:27,740
All right! What do you want?

6
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:29,370
I got one of your birds.

7
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:32,040
I recognised him by the band.

8
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:35,250
It must be Danny-boy.
I lost him in the last race.

9
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,590
He flew into my coop.

10
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:40,840
-You want him?
-I got to watch myself these days.

11
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:42,760
You know what I mean?

12
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:43,970
Don't worry.

13
00:02:44,050 --> 00:02:48,060
-I'll take him up to your loft.
-Okay, I'll see you on the roof.

14
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,330
How goes?

15
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:16,710
He's up on the roof.

16
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:17,960
The pigeon?

17
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:20,210
Yeah, it worked.

18
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:27,550
I think somebody fell off the roof.

19
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:37,520
He thought he'd sing
to the Crime Commission. He won't.

20
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:39,400
I thought they'd talk to him.

21
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:40,730
That's the idea.

22
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:43,570
I thought they'd talk to him
and get him to dummy up.

23
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:45,360
Maybe he gave them an argument.

24
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:49,030
I figured the worst they was gonna do
was lean on him a little bit.

25
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,870
Maybe he gave them an argument.

26
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:54,460
He's been giving Johnny the Boss
a lot of arguments lately.

27
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,710
He wasn't a bad kid, that Joey.

28
00:03:57,790 --> 00:03:58,960
A canary.

29
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,590
Maybe he could sing, but he couldn't fly.

30
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,180
Come on, I'll buy you a drink.

31
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:15,270
I'll be in there later and....

32
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,030
Father Barry is here.

33
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:33,370
Same thing happened to my Andy
five years ago.

34
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:35,700
-You're the boy's father?
-That's right.

35
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:38,540
Looks like he fell off the roof,
or maybe he was pushed.

36
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:39,790
-Any ideas?
-No.

37
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:43,840
He was the only longshoreman that had
the guts to talk to the crime investigators.

38
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,760
-Who asked you?
-Everybody knows that.

39
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:46,590
Shut up.

40
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:49,760
-lf he took my advice he wouldn't be--
-Everyone knows that.

41
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:50,890
I said, "Shut up!"

42
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:53,760
I know how you feel about cops,
but if you give me...

43
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:55,270
...some leads I could--

44
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:57,480
I kept telling him, "Don't say nothing.

45
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,560
"Keep quiet, you'll live longer."

46
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:04,820
I've been on the docks all my life,
boy, and there's one thing I learned.

47
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:08,150
You don't ask no questions,
you don't answer no questions...

48
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,740
...unless you want to wind up like that.

49
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,250
Edie, come here.

50
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:18,870
I want to talk to you.

51
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,750
Father, who'd want to kill Joey?

52
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:28,760
Stay away from him! Stay away from him!

53
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:30,680
Edie, listen!

54
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,890
Remember time and faith are great healers.

55
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:36,020
Father, my brother is dead
and you talk about time and faith.

56
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:39,640
My brother was the best kid in the
neighbourhood and everybody said so.

57
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:42,060
I'm in the church if you need me.

58
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,230
You're in the church if I need you?

59
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:48,150
Did you ever hear of a saint
hiding in a church?

60
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:52,070
I want to know who killed my brother!

61
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:55,330
What's the matter with you, punk?

62
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:05,000
Boss, Packy wants another drink
on the cuff.

63
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:07,090
Give it to him.

64
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,800
And here's the cut on the shape-up.

65
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:14,390
891 men, $3 a head. That's $2,673.

66
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:17,220
Charley, you count them.

67
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:20,520
The banana boat is 46 tomorrow.

68
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:24,020
If we pull a walkout,
it might be a few bucks from the shippers.

69
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:26,860
-Them bananas go bad in a hurry.
-Ask $2,000.

70
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:30,570
Clowns can't fight.

71
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:34,870
There's nobody tough anymore.

72
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:36,780
Hi, slugger.

73
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,080
Hi, kid.

74
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:47,170
Where's Morgan?
Where's that big banker of mine?

75
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:48,800
Right here, Mr. Friendly.

76
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:52,220
-Hi, JP, how's business?
-Having trouble with Kelly again, boss.

77
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:55,220
He won't take no loans
and Big Mac puts him to work anyway.

78
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:57,890
-He's my wife's nephew.
-He won't take no loans!

79
00:06:57,970 --> 00:07:00,390
I got to put him to work.
She'd murder me!

80
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:02,520
That's why I never got married.

81
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:05,730
Here's the interest on the day, boss. $532.

82
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:07,650
You count it.

83
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:09,480
Counting makes me sleepy.

84
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:12,030
You handle that sheet metal all right?

85
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:14,990
It was easy. The new checker faked
the receipt. Here.

86
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:17,910
You want to talk to me,
take the cigar out of your mouth.

87
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:20,330
-Stow the receipt. I'll take the cash.
-Sure.

88
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:23,910
-Here you are, 45 bills.
-Terry, you count this.

89
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,750
Come on, go on, it's good for you.

90
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,670
-lt develops your mind.
-What mind?

91
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,470
Shut up. I like the kid.

92
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:35,800
Remember the night
he took Farella at St. Nick's, Charley?

93
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:39,220
We won a bundle. Real tough. A big try.

94
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:41,020
I lost the count.

95
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:45,440
Okay, forget it, Einstein.

96
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:48,980
How come you never got an education
like your brother Charley?

97
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:52,900
The only arithmetic he ever got
was hearing the referee count up to 10.

98
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:55,610
You're not too funny today, Fat Man.

99
00:07:56,950 --> 00:08:00,490
Hey, what gives
with our boy tonight, Charley?

100
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:02,120
He isn't himself.

101
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:05,660
It's the Joey Doyle thing
and how he exaggerates the thing.

102
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:08,710
Too much Marquis of Queensbury
softens him up.

103
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:11,880
Listen, I'm a soft touch, too.
Ask any rummy on the dock...

104
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:15,550
...if I'm not good for a fin any time
they put the arm on me.

105
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:20,720
But my old lady raised us 10 kids
on a stinking watchman's pension.

106
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:25,350
When I was 16,
I had to beg for work in the hold.

107
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:29,110
I didn't work my way up
out of there for nothing.

108
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:31,020
I know that, Johnny, I know it.

109
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:33,400
Taking over this local took a little doing.

110
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:37,360
There were rough fellas in the way.
They gave me this to remember them by.

111
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:41,580
He kept his hand over his throat
to stay alive and he still went after them.

112
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:43,410
I know what's eating you.

113
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:49,920
I got 2,000 dues-paying members in
this local, that's $72,000 a year legitimate.

114
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:54,710
When each one of them puts in
a couple of bucks a day just to make sure...

115
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,510
...the work's steady, well, figure it out.

116
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,550
That's just for openers.

117
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:02,810
We've got the fattest piers
in the fattest harbour in the world.

118
00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:05,140
Everything moves in and out,
we take our cut.

119
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:09,230
Why shouldn't we?
If we can get it, we're entitled to it.

120
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:13,320
You don't suppose I can afford to be
boxed out of a deal like this, do you?

121
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:17,610
A deal I sweated and bled for, on account
of one lousy little cheese-eater...

122
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:22,030
...that Doyle bum, who thinks he can
squeal to the crime commission. Do you?

123
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,170
Do you?

124
00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:35,050
No, Johnny.
I just figured I should have been told.

125
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:36,840
I make it $2,623.

126
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:39,430
You're $50 short, Skins.

127
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:46,680
Gimme.

128
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:51,270
-I must've miscounted.
-Gimme!

129
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:03,240
You come from Green Point, go back there.
You don't work here no more.

130
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:12,670
Here, kid, here's half a bill.
Go get you a load on.

131
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:14,420
No, I'm okay, Johnny, thanks.

132
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,550
Present from your Uncle Johnny.

133
00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:21,970
And Mac, tomorrow morning when you
shape the men, put Terry up in the loft.

134
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:24,510
Number one. Every day.

135
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:28,850
It's nice, easy work if you check in
and goof off on a coffee bag.

136
00:10:28,930 --> 00:10:30,270
Okay?

137
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,280
You got a real friend here.

138
00:10:39,650 --> 00:10:41,200
Now don't forget it.

139
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,910
Why should he forget it?

140
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:45,620
Thanks, Johnny.

141
00:10:54,290 --> 00:10:56,000
All right, payday.

142
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:57,920
Rony.

143
00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:00,170
Mac.

144
00:11:23,570 --> 00:11:24,950
Hi, Terry.

145
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:30,330
-Hi, kid.
-I was just going to feed them.

146
00:11:30,410 --> 00:11:31,870
I already fed them.

147
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:33,750
You must've been up early?

148
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:36,880
I was up anyhow,
so I figured I might as well.

149
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,420
They sure got it made.

150
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:46,550
Eating, sleeping, flying around like crazy,
raising gobs of squabs.

151
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:53,390
Well, I better get over there.

152
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:04,900
Be careful. Don't spill no water on the
floor. I don't want them to catch cold.

153
00:12:05,650 --> 00:12:07,200
I'll see you around.

154
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:18,290
Come on, Tony, give me the tabs.

155
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:24,220
He was a good boy, that Doyle kid.

156
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:26,590
Sure he was,
that's why he got it in the head.

157
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:29,350
But he couldn't learn
to keep his mouth shut.

158
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:36,890
Hey, Pop, why don't you go home?

159
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:39,610
The boys at work today
will be chipping in gladly.

160
00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:41,570
No thanks, fellas, I'm gonna shape.

161
00:12:41,650 --> 00:12:46,490
-Who do you think'll pay for the funeral?
-Johnny Friendly, the "great labour leader."

162
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:49,870
Why don't you keep that big mouth
of yours shut?

163
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:51,700
What are you, a wise guy?

164
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:55,000
If I was wise, I wouldn't be
no longshoreman for 30 years.

165
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:57,290
I'm poorer now than when I started.

166
00:12:57,370 --> 00:12:58,960
-Wise guy.
-Big mouth.

167
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,670
Don't mess with those guys.

168
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:06,760
I brought you Joey's windbreaker.
It might come in handy.

169
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:09,640
-Go ahead, wear it.
-Thanks, Pop.

170
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:12,760
Mine's more full of holes
than the Pittsburgh infield.

171
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:15,810
Hey, Joe, I got a coat for you.

172
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:29,780
Do you know Terry Malloy?

173
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,410
No, I don't. Never heard of him.

174
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:37,750
You're Terry Malloy, aren't you?

175
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:40,960
So what?

176
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,710
Didn't I see you fight
a couple of years ago?

177
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,960
Without the birdseed, what do you want?

178
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:48,800
Identification.

179
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:55,430
Waterfront Crime Commission.
What's that?

180
00:13:55,510 --> 00:13:57,560
I just want to ask you a few questions.

181
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:00,310
We'll hold public hearings
on waterfront crime...

182
00:14:00,390 --> 00:14:03,060
...and underworld infiltration
of longshore unions.

183
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:06,400
-I don't know nothing.
-You haven't heard the questions yet.

184
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,610
-What did you say?
-You heard me.

185
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:12,820
There's a rumour that you're one of
the last people to see Joey Doyle alive.

186
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:14,200
I don't know nothing.

187
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:16,620
Nobody's accusing you of anything,
Mr. Malloy.

188
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:18,200
I hope you understand that.

189
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:22,080
Just want to ask you some questions
about some people you may know.

190
00:14:24,210 --> 00:14:26,420
-People I may know.
-That's right.

191
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:30,470
-You better get out of here, buster!
-Slow down, boy.

192
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:35,550
I don't know nothing, I ain't seen nothing,
and I'm not saying nothing.

193
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:37,930
Why don't you and your girlfriend take off.

194
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:39,430
All right, Mr. Malloy!

195
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:42,600
You've every right not to talk
if that's what you choose to do.

196
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:45,190
-The public has a right to know the facts.
-Yeah.

197
00:14:45,270 --> 00:14:46,770
We'll be seeing you again.

198
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:49,740
Never's going to be too much soon
for me, Shorty.

199
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,490
Take it easy.

200
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:56,490
How do you like them mutts
taking me for a pigeon.

201
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:59,120
-Who is it?
-I don't know who they are.

202
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:03,370
You're three weeks behind on the last $25,
but I'm willing to take a chance.

203
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:06,960
Some chance at ten percent a week
and if we don't borrow, we don't work.

204
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,750
May you rot in hell, JP.

205
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:12,170
When I'm dead and gone,
you'll know what a friend I was.

206
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:15,260
Why don't you drop dead now,
so we can test your theory?

207
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:16,850
Condolences.

208
00:15:17,890 --> 00:15:19,350
Hey, Pop, look.

209
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,900
Let her go, Tony.

210
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:45,830
I guess I spoke out of turn last night.

211
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:53,090
You think I'm just a gravy-train rider
with a turned-around collar, don't you?

212
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:01,640
I see the sisters taught you not to lie.

213
00:16:03,770 --> 00:16:07,020
All right. Loft gang: Malloy...

214
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:10,360
...Hendriks, Padowski...

215
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:13,070
...Westerfield, McGuier.

216
00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:20,200
I've been thinking about your question,
and you're right, Edie.

217
00:16:22,450 --> 00:16:23,910
This is my parish.

218
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:27,580
I don't know how much I can do,
but I'll never find out...

219
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:31,050
...unless I come down here
and take a good look for myself.

220
00:16:31,210 --> 00:16:33,710
I need some extra banana carriers.

221
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:34,880
Bananas again.

222
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:38,930
I wonder when we'll get a boat from
Ireland with good Irish whiskey on it.

223
00:16:39,010 --> 00:16:41,310
Dugan, my boy, you're dreaming again.

224
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:45,850
All right. Kelly. Richie.

225
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:57,490
Yeah, you.

226
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:02,620
What's the matter?
Nobody want to work today?

227
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:06,540
Yeah, you.

228
00:17:14,050 --> 00:17:16,720
Who do you see to get
a day's pay around here?

229
00:17:31,770 --> 00:17:34,110
-Meatballs.
-Definitely.

230
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:41,620
Come here.

231
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:44,330
Hey, Terry, grab that one!

232
00:17:49,210 --> 00:17:50,920
Give me that.

233
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,040
Get away!

234
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:55,170
-Give it to me!
-Why?

235
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:57,090
Give it to me!

236
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,590
What makes you so special?

237
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:02,550
Things are looking up on the dock.

238
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:05,260
Don't you recognise her?
That's Joey Doyle's sister.

239
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:06,720
Give me that.

240
00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:12,480
-You're Joey Doyle's sister?
-Yes, I am.

241
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:17,690
You don't wanna go to work today anyhow.

242
00:18:18,570 --> 00:18:20,740
It's been nice wrestling with you.

243
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:26,120
Edie!

244
00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:29,580
Pop. Here's your tab, take it.

245
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:34,080
All right, give it to me. I can use it.

246
00:18:34,170 --> 00:18:36,590
Now get back to the sisters
where you belong.

247
00:18:36,670 --> 00:18:40,170
I'm surprised at you, Father,
if you don't mind my saying so.

248
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:43,840
Letting her see things ain't fit
for the eyes of a decent girl.

249
00:18:44,050 --> 00:18:46,720
All right, that's all. Come back tomorrow.

250
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:54,060
What do you do now?

251
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:56,730
Like Big Mac said, come back tomorrow.

252
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:58,780
Tomorrow? No ship tomorrow.

253
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:02,400
I've been standing here for five
straight mornings and that bum there...

254
00:19:02,490 --> 00:19:06,160
-Come on, get out of here!
-...looks right through you.

255
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:11,120
-I'm sorry, Father, I didn't mean it.
-What do you want to do?

256
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:13,330
Come on, let's go get a ball.

257
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:16,750
Wait a minute.
Is this all you do, just take it like this?

258
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:20,010
What about your unions?

259
00:19:24,010 --> 00:19:27,010
No other union in the country'd
stand for a thing like that.

260
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:30,520
The waterfront is tougher, Father,
like it ain't part of America.

261
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:34,400
-Do you know how a trigger local works?
-No. How?

262
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:39,150
You get up in the meeting, you make a
motion, the lights go out, then you go out.

263
00:19:39,230 --> 00:19:42,780
That's how it's been since Johnny
and his cowboys took over the local.

264
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:46,030
Name one place where it's safe
to talk without getting clobbered.

265
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:48,240
-The church.
-What?

266
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:52,540
The bottom of the church.

267
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:55,290
You know
what you're letting yourself in for?

268
00:19:57,250 --> 00:19:59,090
You got a cigarette on you?

269
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:12,310
Right over there.

270
00:20:19,770 --> 00:20:22,400
-You working hard?
-Yeah.

271
00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:27,110
You wouldn't mind working once in a while
to justify this lofty position, would you?

272
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:31,290
I finished the work.
I counted all them bags.

273
00:20:31,370 --> 00:20:33,250
We have an extra detail for you.

274
00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:36,670
That's if you don't mind
being disturbed or anything.

275
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:43,170
The priest and this Doyle girl are getting
a meeting up together down at the church.

276
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:46,590
We want a rundown on the names
and the numbers of all the players.

277
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:49,760
Wait a minute. All right, you're nominated.

278
00:20:49,890 --> 00:20:52,810
Why me, Charley?
I feel funny going down there.

279
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:55,310
I'd just be stooling for you.

280
00:20:55,390 --> 00:20:59,110
Let me tell you what stooling is.
Stooling is when you rat on your friend...

281
00:20:59,190 --> 00:21:01,440
...the guys you're with.
Johnny wants a favour.

282
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,690
Don't think about it. Do it.

283
00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:07,950
Go on. Join the congregation.

284
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:27,010
I thought there would be
more of you here, but....

285
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:32,850
The Romans found out what a handful
could do if it's the right handful.

286
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:41,770
I'm just a potato-eater,
but isn't it simple as one, two, three?

287
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:43,820
One. The working conditions are bad.

288
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:46,440
Two. They're bad
because the mob does the hiring.

289
00:21:46,530 --> 00:21:51,070
Three. The only way to break the mob is
to stop letting them get away with murder.

290
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:54,700
If one of you'll answer one question,
we'd have a very good start.

291
00:21:54,790 --> 00:21:58,000
And that question is:
Who killed Joey Doyle?

292
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:09,880
Not one of you has a line
on who killed Joey Doyle?

293
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:17,020
I have a hunch all of you
could tell us something about it.

294
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:20,940
All right, then answer this one:

295
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:25,570
How can we call ourselves Christians and
protect these murderers with our silence?

296
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:34,450
Jimmy Collins, you were Joey's best friend.

297
00:22:34,870 --> 00:22:37,330
How can you just sit there
and not say anything?

298
00:22:37,410 --> 00:22:41,080
I'll always think of him as my best friend,
but what do you want me to--

299
00:22:41,170 --> 00:22:42,790
Who asked him in here?

300
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:46,380
I'm trying to find out
what happened to Joey Doyle.

301
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:48,670
-Maybe you can be helpful.
-Helpful?

302
00:22:49,050 --> 00:22:50,880
The brother of Charley the Gent?

303
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:53,340
They'll help us get to the bottom
of the river.

304
00:22:53,430 --> 00:22:55,390
You better leave Charley out of this.

305
00:22:55,470 --> 00:22:58,850
-You don't think he'd be helpful?
-Why don't you ask him yourself?

306
00:22:58,930 --> 00:23:03,520
-Maybe I will one of these days.
-One of these days.

307
00:23:04,770 --> 00:23:07,320
Now, listen, you know who the pistols are.

308
00:23:08,650 --> 00:23:12,240
Are you going to keep still
until they cut you down one by one?

309
00:23:13,950 --> 00:23:15,120
Are you?

310
00:23:16,490 --> 00:23:18,580
Dugan! How about you? Are you?

311
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:21,370
One thing you have to understand,
Father, on the dock...

312
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:23,290
...we've always been D and D.

313
00:23:23,370 --> 00:23:25,420
-D and D? What's that?
-Deaf and dumb.

314
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:28,340
No matter how much
we hate the torpedoes, we don't rat.

315
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:30,880
Rat? Now boys, get smart.

316
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:35,050
I know you're getting pushed around,
but there's one thing...

317
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:38,060
...we have in this country,
and that's ways of fighting back.

318
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:39,850
Getting the facts to the public.

319
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:42,940
Testifying for what is right against
what is wrong.

320
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:47,060
What's ratting to them is telling the truth
for you, can't you see that?

321
00:23:48,650 --> 00:23:50,780
Can't you see that?

322
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:11,260
It seems to me we've gone just about
as far as we can at this time.

323
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:13,840
I think you'll agree with that, Father.

324
00:24:14,090 --> 00:24:17,390
So, I'd like to close with a few words
from St. Matthew:

325
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:20,560
"Come unto me all you--"

326
00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:29,820
What did I tell you
about sticking your neck out.

327
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:33,150
-This is a police problem, not ours.
-These people need help.

328
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:36,360
Okay. Only don't blame me when
they ship you off to Abyssinia.

329
00:24:36,450 --> 00:24:37,490
I won't.

330
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,040
You better go home in pairs.
Twos is two, you know.

331
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:50,540
Come on.

332
00:24:53,210 --> 00:24:55,630
Pop!

333
00:25:07,270 --> 00:25:09,900
Edie!

334
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:29,080
What's happened to Pop?

335
00:25:29,170 --> 00:25:32,250
He's all right.
He's an old man, they won't hurt him.

336
00:25:32,630 --> 00:25:33,880
Get out, you!

337
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,220
Are you all right?

338
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:45,140
Yeah, considering they were using
my head for a baseball.

339
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:47,690
You still D and D?
Do you still call it ratting?

340
00:25:47,770 --> 00:25:49,900
-Are you on the level?
-What do you think?

341
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:53,020
If I stick my neck out and it's chopped off,
is that the end?

342
00:25:53,110 --> 00:25:55,730
-Or will you go all the way?
-Down the line.

343
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:59,200
They'll put muscle on you, too,
turned-around collar or not.

344
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:03,700
Wipe your face. Listen, you stand up
and I'll stand up with you.

345
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:05,740
-Right down the wire?
-So help me God.

346
00:26:10,170 --> 00:26:11,670
I think we're okay.

347
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:13,920
Steel pipes and baseball bats.

348
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:16,260
They play pretty rough around here.

349
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:18,510
I can make it home now all right.

350
00:26:20,510 --> 00:26:22,220
Which side are you with?

351
00:26:23,390 --> 00:26:25,310
Me? I'm with me, Terry.

352
00:26:25,970 --> 00:26:28,430
You got a dime for a cup of coffee?

353
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:30,310
Go on, beat it, will you?

354
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:32,480
A little dime you don't need?

355
00:26:33,610 --> 00:26:37,190
I know you. You're Edie Doyle.

356
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,610
Come on. Beat it.

357
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:44,120
Your brother was a saint, the only one
who ever tried to get me compensation.

358
00:26:44,870 --> 00:26:46,200
You remember, Terry.

359
00:26:46,290 --> 00:26:48,040
You was there that night.

360
00:26:51,830 --> 00:26:54,460
Here's some change.
Go have yourself a ball.

361
00:26:55,130 --> 00:26:58,630
You don't buy me. You're still a bum.

362
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:00,630
So long, Edie.

363
00:27:01,630 --> 00:27:03,340
Lord have mercy on Joey.

364
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:06,890
Who's calling me a bum?

365
00:27:09,810 --> 00:27:11,390
Everybody loved Joey.

366
00:27:12,690 --> 00:27:14,940
From little kids to the old rummies.

367
00:27:17,190 --> 00:27:19,030
Did you know him very well?

368
00:27:20,570 --> 00:27:22,280
You know, he got around.

369
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,080
What did that man mean just now?

370
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:29,950
Don't pay no attention to him.
He's drunk, he's falling down. Everything.

371
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:32,750
He's a juicehead
that hangs around the neighbourhood.

372
00:27:32,830 --> 00:27:34,540
Don't pay no attention.

373
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:36,250
I better go now.

374
00:27:37,090 --> 00:27:40,590
You don't have to be afraid of me.
I'm not going to bite you.

375
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:44,680
I guess they don't let you walk
with fellas where you've been?

376
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:46,640
You know how the sisters are.

377
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:47,720
Yeah.

378
00:27:47,810 --> 00:27:51,930
-Are you training to be a nun?
-lt's just a regular college.

379
00:27:53,690 --> 00:27:56,020
It's run by the Sisters of St. Anne.

380
00:27:56,810 --> 00:27:58,070
Where is that?

381
00:27:59,110 --> 00:28:00,360
In Tarrytown.

382
00:28:01,570 --> 00:28:03,950
-Where's that?
-ln the country.

383
00:28:04,490 --> 00:28:07,660
I don't like the country.
The crickets make me nervous.

384
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:12,080
How often do you get in here?

385
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:17,130
I haven't been here since last Christmas.

386
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:20,050
We were going to have
a Thanksgiving party.

387
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:22,880
That's nice.

388
00:28:24,050 --> 00:28:26,800
What do you do up there? Just study?

389
00:28:27,890 --> 00:28:29,470
I want to be a teacher.

390
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:32,100
Teacher? That's very good.

391
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:34,480
Personally, I admire brains.

392
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:38,900
My brother Charley is a very brainy guy.
He had a couple of years of college.

393
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:43,610
It isn't just brains. It's how you use them.

394
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:46,030
Yeah, I get your thought.

395
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,740
You know, I've seen you
a lot of times before.

396
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:52,200
Do you remember parochial school
out on Puluski Street?

397
00:28:52,290 --> 00:28:54,040
Seven, eight years ago?

398
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:56,620
-Your hair, you had your hair....
-Braids.

399
00:28:56,710 --> 00:28:59,210
Looked like a hunk of rope.

400
00:28:59,290 --> 00:29:03,170
You had wires on your teeth and glasses.
Everything.

401
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:05,840
You was really a mess.

402
00:29:06,930 --> 00:29:09,260
I can get home all right now, thanks.

403
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:12,640
Don't get sore.
I was just kidding you a little bit.

404
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:16,390
I just mean to tell you that you're,
you grew up very nice.

405
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:18,980
Thanks.

406
00:29:20,150 --> 00:29:22,190
You don't remember me, do you?

407
00:29:25,190 --> 00:29:27,570
I remembered you
the first moment I saw you.

408
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:29,070
By the nose, huh?

409
00:29:32,790 --> 00:29:35,750
Some people just got faces that
stick in your mind.

410
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:41,380
I remember you were in trouble
all the time.

411
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:42,800
Now you got me.

412
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:47,760
The way those sisters used to whack me,
I don't know what.

413
00:29:48,590 --> 00:29:52,850
They thought they was going to beat
an education into me, but I foxed them.

414
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:57,390
Maybe they just didn't know how
to handle you.

415
00:29:57,980 --> 00:29:59,810
How would you have done it?

416
00:30:01,730 --> 00:30:04,280
With a little more patience and kindness.

417
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:08,070
That's what makes people
mean and difficult.

418
00:30:08,150 --> 00:30:10,490
People don't care enough about them.

419
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:16,870
Are you kidding me?

420
00:30:17,290 --> 00:30:18,960
I'd better get you home.

421
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:22,880
There's too many guys around here
with only one thing on their mind.

422
00:30:24,630 --> 00:30:26,550
Am I going to see you again?

423
00:30:29,550 --> 00:30:30,890
What for?

424
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:35,390
I don't know.

425
00:30:40,190 --> 00:30:42,230
I really don't know.

426
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:49,280
Come on.

427
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:11,050
You're all packed. Here's your bus ticket
and you're on your way back to St. Anne's.

428
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:13,930
I'm not ready to go back yet, Pop.

429
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:17,810
Edie, for years your mom and me
put quarters in the cookie jar...

430
00:31:17,890 --> 00:31:20,600
...to keep you up there with the sisters...

431
00:31:20,850 --> 00:31:24,650
...and keep you from things like
I've just seen outside the window.

432
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:28,190
A daughter of mine walking arm in arm
with Terry Malloy.

433
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:30,950
-Do you know who Terry Malloy is?
-Who is he, Pop?

434
00:31:31,030 --> 00:31:33,660
He's the kid brother of Charley the Gent...

435
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:38,040
...who is Johnny Friendly's right hand
and a butcher in a camel hair coat.

436
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:42,000
Are you trying to tell me Terry is, too?

437
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,790
He tries to act tough...

438
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:48,500
...but there's a look in his eye.

439
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:52,970
Yeah, a look in his eye.
Hold your hats, brothers, here we go again.

440
00:31:53,590 --> 00:31:57,680
You think he's one of them cases
you're always dragging into the house...

441
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:59,220
...and feeling sorry for...

442
00:31:59,310 --> 00:32:01,930
...like that litter of kittens you brought in.

443
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:07,110
The only one you wanted to keep
had six toes and was cockeyed to boot.

444
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:09,900
Look at him. The little bum.

445
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:12,570
He said he wants to see me again.

446
00:32:19,490 --> 00:32:21,200
See this arm?

447
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:25,710
Two inches longer than the other.

448
00:32:26,250 --> 00:32:32,670
That's from years of working and sweating,
lifting and swinging a hook.

449
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:39,470
Every time I heist a box or a coffee bag,
I says to myself...

450
00:32:39,930 --> 00:32:43,560
...that is for Edie so she can be
a teacher or something decent.

451
00:32:46,150 --> 00:32:49,440
I promised your mom, Edie.
Don't let her down.

452
00:32:52,490 --> 00:32:56,110
I don't want you to think
I'm not grateful for everything you've done.

453
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:59,740
For giving me the education
and keeping me away from all this.

454
00:33:00,870 --> 00:33:03,410
But I've seen things
that I know are so wrong.

455
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:08,040
How can I go back to school and keep
my mind on things that are just in books...

456
00:33:08,130 --> 00:33:10,090
...that aren't people living?

457
00:33:11,250 --> 00:33:12,800
I'm going to stay.

458
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:16,880
I'm going to keep on trying
to find out who is guilty for Joey.

459
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:07,100
Hi.

460
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:10,100
What are you doing up there on the roof?

461
00:34:12,270 --> 00:34:13,690
Just looking.

462
00:34:14,730 --> 00:34:17,860
Take a look at the champion flock
of the neighbourhood.

463
00:34:19,610 --> 00:34:21,200
Fly pretty nice, huh?

464
00:34:22,830 --> 00:34:24,200
Golden Warriors?

465
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:29,040
Yeah. I founded the Golden Warriors.

466
00:34:29,750 --> 00:34:32,330
Might say that I was
the original Golden Warrior.

467
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:36,710
This bum here is my shadow.

468
00:34:37,010 --> 00:34:39,930
He thinks I'm a tough man
because I boxed pro a lot.

469
00:34:43,850 --> 00:34:45,680
Joey used to raise pigeons.

470
00:34:48,850 --> 00:34:50,600
Joey used to raise pigeons.

471
00:34:53,110 --> 00:34:54,860
Yeah, he had a few birds.

472
00:34:57,900 --> 00:34:59,900
I've been taking care of them.

473
00:35:00,450 --> 00:35:03,780
I wouldn't have thought
you'd be so interested in pigeons.

474
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:07,580
I just go for it.

475
00:35:10,830 --> 00:35:13,080
You know this city is full of hawks?

476
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:16,960
That's a fact.
They hang around on top of the big hotels.

477
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:22,470
They spot a pigeon in the park,
right down on them.

478
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:26,140
You got a second?

479
00:35:30,230 --> 00:35:32,190
I want to show you something.

480
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:43,610
What do you think of that fellow?

481
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:45,620
She's a beauty.

482
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:47,790
She's a he. His name is Swifty.

483
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:51,290
Look what he went and did.

484
00:35:56,170 --> 00:36:00,630
He's my lead bird. He's always on
top of the perch. If another bum tries...

485
00:36:00,710 --> 00:36:04,340
...to come along and take his place,
he really lets him have it.

486
00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:08,180
Even pigeons aren't peaceful.

487
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:13,600
There's one thing about them,
they're very faithful.

488
00:36:14,230 --> 00:36:16,060
They get married just like people.

489
00:36:16,150 --> 00:36:17,110
Better.

490
00:36:18,070 --> 00:36:20,650
They stay that way until one of them dies.

491
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:23,570
That's nice.

492
00:36:29,990 --> 00:36:31,700
Go ahead. Fix the roof.

493
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:37,290
You want that egg?

494
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:42,340
Thanks.

495
00:36:46,890 --> 00:36:48,300
Do you like beer?

496
00:36:50,510 --> 00:36:51,970
I don't know.

497
00:36:53,980 --> 00:36:56,230
I bet you never had a glass of beer.

498
00:36:56,690 --> 00:36:59,360
-Did you ever have a glass of beer?
-No.

499
00:37:03,650 --> 00:37:05,610
You want to have one with me?

500
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:08,950
In a saloon?

501
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:14,120
I know a nice dump down here
that has a special entrance for ladies.

502
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:21,250
Come on, it won't hurt.

503
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:25,670
Come on.

504
00:37:29,090 --> 00:37:30,350
Okay.

505
00:37:37,390 --> 00:37:38,900
Hey, you, mac.

506
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:43,230
Two Glockenheimers and two for chasers.

507
00:37:44,610 --> 00:37:47,030
-Did you see the fight last night?
-No.

508
00:37:47,570 --> 00:37:50,700
A kid named Riley, both hands.
Like you used to do.

509
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:55,200
I hope he got better dice than me.

510
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:01,210
Were you really a prizefighter?

511
00:38:02,710 --> 00:38:03,960
I used to be.

512
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:08,050
How did you get interested in that?

513
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:12,890
I don't know. I had to scrap all my life,
I might as well get paid for it.

514
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:16,770
When I was a kid
my old man got bumped off.

515
00:38:16,850 --> 00:38:21,060
Never mind how.
Then they stuck Charley and me...

516
00:38:23,070 --> 00:38:25,440
...in a dump they call a "children's home."

517
00:38:27,570 --> 00:38:29,280
Boy, that was some home.

518
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:34,160
Anyhow, I ran away from there
and fought in the club smokers...

519
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:37,330
...and peddled papers and Johnny Friendly
bought a piece of me.

520
00:38:37,410 --> 00:38:38,910
Bought a piece of you?

521
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:42,170
Yes. Then...

522
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:45,710
...I was going pretty good there for awhile.

523
00:38:46,050 --> 00:38:47,470
And after that....

524
00:38:51,890 --> 00:38:54,390
What do you really care, am I right?

525
00:38:57,310 --> 00:39:00,020
Shouldn't everybody care about
everybody else?

526
00:39:03,190 --> 00:39:05,190
Boy, what a fruitcake you are.

527
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:09,200
I mean, isn't everybody
a part of everybody else?

528
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:11,820
And you really believe that drool?

529
00:39:11,910 --> 00:39:13,240
Yes, I do.

530
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:18,700
Here we are. One for the lady
and for the gent.

531
00:39:21,170 --> 00:39:24,080
Here's to the first one,
I hope it ain't the last.

532
00:39:26,130 --> 00:39:27,630
Go ahead.

533
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:35,640
No, not like that. One hum.

534
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:50,400
Do you want to hear my philosophy of life?

535
00:39:53,490 --> 00:39:55,870
Do it to him before he does it to you.

536
00:39:56,740 --> 00:39:58,660
I never met anyone like you.

537
00:40:00,450 --> 00:40:05,380
There's not a spark of sentiment,
or romance...

538
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:07,590
...or human kindness in your whole body.

539
00:40:07,670 --> 00:40:10,420
What good does it to you
besides get you in trouble?

540
00:40:10,510 --> 00:40:14,390
And when things and people get in
your way, you just knock them aside...

541
00:40:14,470 --> 00:40:16,550
...get rid of them. Is that your idea?

542
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:20,560
Don't look at me when you say that.
It wasn't my fault what happened to Joey.

543
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:22,440
Fixing him wasn't my idea.

544
00:40:23,690 --> 00:40:25,060
Who said it was?

545
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:27,770
Everybody's putting the needle on me.

546
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:31,320
You and the mugs in the church
and Father Barry.

547
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:33,650
I didn't like the way he was looking at me.

548
00:40:33,740 --> 00:40:35,990
He was looking at everybody
the same way.

549
00:40:36,070 --> 00:40:37,160
Oh, yeah?

550
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:40,120
What's with this Father Barry?

551
00:40:40,450 --> 00:40:42,580
-What's his racket?
-His racket?

552
00:40:42,830 --> 00:40:44,210
Yeah, his racket.

553
00:40:44,290 --> 00:40:46,670
-Everybody's got a racket.
-But he's a priest.

554
00:40:46,750 --> 00:40:48,290
Are you kidding, so what?

555
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:52,210
-That don't make no difference.
-You don't believe anybody, do you?

556
00:40:53,130 --> 00:40:55,340
Down here it's every man for himself.

557
00:40:55,430 --> 00:40:58,890
It's keeping alive. It's standing
with the right people so you get...

558
00:40:58,970 --> 00:41:01,470
...a little bit of change in your pocket.

559
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:04,270
-And if you don't?
-lf you don't? Right down.

560
00:41:06,150 --> 00:41:07,980
It's living like an animal.

561
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:11,860
I'd rather live like an animal
than end up like....

562
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:13,030
Like Joey?

563
00:41:14,650 --> 00:41:17,160
-Are you afraid to mention his name?
-No.

564
00:41:19,030 --> 00:41:21,290
Why do you keep harping on that for?

565
00:41:22,660 --> 00:41:26,040
Come on, drink up.
You got to get a little fun out of life.

566
00:41:26,290 --> 00:41:28,500
Come on. I'll stick some music on.

567
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:37,300
What's the matter?

568
00:41:44,930 --> 00:41:47,650
What's the matter with you?

569
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:53,150
Help me if you can for God's sake.

570
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:59,240
Edie, I'd like to help.

571
00:42:00,450 --> 00:42:03,200
I'd like to help,
but there's nothing I can do.

572
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:06,500
All right.

573
00:42:09,380 --> 00:42:11,210
I shouldn't have asked you.

574
00:42:13,340 --> 00:42:15,550
Edie, come on. Have a little beer.

575
00:42:16,220 --> 00:42:17,680
Come on.

576
00:42:19,930 --> 00:42:21,260
I don't want it.

577
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:27,940
You just stay here and finish your drink.

578
00:42:28,020 --> 00:42:31,520
Don't go. I've got my whole life to drink.

579
00:42:36,940 --> 00:42:38,650
Are you sore at me?

580
00:42:42,620 --> 00:42:43,950
What for?

581
00:42:49,750 --> 00:42:52,380
I don't know, for not being no help to you.

582
00:42:57,090 --> 00:42:59,380
You would if you could.

583
00:43:11,980 --> 00:43:13,860
Here I come.

584
00:43:14,060 --> 00:43:16,730
Pick a winner.

585
00:43:17,230 --> 00:43:19,650
First I got to kiss the bride.

586
00:43:19,740 --> 00:43:23,370
Go on, you've kissed her before!

587
00:43:31,750 --> 00:43:34,790
You can get out that way.
You want me to take you?

588
00:43:41,550 --> 00:43:44,640
-Come on. What's going on here?
-Give me a cigarette.

589
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:46,930
You've got to stop smoking so much.

590
00:43:48,270 --> 00:43:50,520
Come on, we'll get out through here.

591
00:43:52,020 --> 00:43:53,480
What's the matter?

592
00:43:59,650 --> 00:44:00,900
Come on.

593
00:44:00,990 --> 00:44:02,610
That's a pretty tune.

594
00:44:07,080 --> 00:44:10,080
Here's a stick of gum. It'll do you good.

595
00:44:11,250 --> 00:44:13,620
-Thank you.
-Do you like that music?

596
00:44:20,550 --> 00:44:23,590
If I had my tuxedo,
I'd ask you to dance, but....

597
00:44:25,090 --> 00:44:27,010
Come on. You want to spin?

598
00:44:32,180 --> 00:44:34,270
Come on, don't be afraid.

599
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:37,270
You dance divinely.

600
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:49,910
I think we're doing pretty good.

601
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:53,330
The sisters ought to see you now.

602
00:44:56,250 --> 00:44:57,670
Wait a minute.

603
00:45:01,550 --> 00:45:03,920
I feel like I'm just floating.

604
00:45:05,380 --> 00:45:06,890
I'm just floating.

605
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:11,020
Just floating.

606
00:45:18,900 --> 00:45:22,280
I been looking all over for you, Terry.
The boss wants you.

607
00:45:23,610 --> 00:45:24,740
Right now?

608
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:27,870
Yeah, he just got a call
from "Mr. Upstairs."

609
00:45:28,660 --> 00:45:31,200
Something's gone wrong. He's plenty hot.

610
00:45:31,700 --> 00:45:33,540
I'm going to take her home first.

611
00:45:33,620 --> 00:45:36,540
I wouldn't do that.
I'll see the little lady home.

612
00:45:37,540 --> 00:45:40,000
Tell him I'll come over there
when I'm ready.

613
00:45:40,090 --> 00:45:42,960
Hey, wait up!

614
00:45:44,970 --> 00:45:46,300
Who was that?

615
00:45:47,590 --> 00:45:50,600
I don't know. Some mug.

616
00:45:53,220 --> 00:45:54,640
Who was he?

617
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:59,190
You got to quit trying to find out
about Joey. It ain't safe.

618
00:45:59,270 --> 00:46:01,400
I'm telling you it ain't safe.

619
00:46:02,150 --> 00:46:04,900
Mr. Malloy, I was hoping
I might find you here.

620
00:46:05,070 --> 00:46:06,200
Excuse me, Miss.

621
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:09,120
You're being served with a subpoena,
Mr. Malloy.

622
00:46:10,070 --> 00:46:11,080
What?

623
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:14,830
Be at the State House, Courtroom 9,
10:00 Friday morning.

624
00:46:15,370 --> 00:46:17,920
I told you I don't know nothing about that.

625
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,880
You can bring a lawyer if you wish.

626
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:23,090
You're privileged under the constitution
to protect yourself...

627
00:46:23,170 --> 00:46:26,670
...against questions which might
implicate you in any crimes.

628
00:46:27,970 --> 00:46:29,970
You know what they're asking me to do?

629
00:46:30,050 --> 00:46:33,060
All we want you to do, Mr. Malloy,
is tell the truth.

630
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:37,810
Goodnight, kid. Nice wedding.

631
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:44,280
What are you going to do?

632
00:46:45,650 --> 00:46:49,110
I ain't going to eat cheese
for no cop and that's for sure.

633
00:46:53,990 --> 00:46:57,120
It was Johnny Friendly
who had Joey killed, wasn't it?

634
00:46:57,290 --> 00:47:00,420
He had him killed or
he had something to do with it, didn't he?

635
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:02,590
He and your big brother Charley?

636
00:47:03,290 --> 00:47:06,420
You can't tell me, can you,
because you're a part of it.

637
00:47:06,630 --> 00:47:10,300
Because you're just as bad as
the worst of them. Tell me the truth.

638
00:47:10,380 --> 00:47:13,050
You better go back to that school
out in daisyland.

639
00:47:13,140 --> 00:47:16,020
You're driving yourself nuts,
you're driving me nuts.

640
00:47:16,100 --> 00:47:19,770
Quit worrying about the truth all the time.
Worry about yourself.

641
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:22,650
I should've known you wouldn't tell me.

642
00:47:22,730 --> 00:47:26,570
Pop said Johnny Friendly used to own you.
I think he still owns you.

643
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:31,450
No wonder everybody calls you a bum.

644
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:36,870
Don't say that to me, Edie,
don't say that to me now.

645
00:47:36,950 --> 00:47:40,870
No wonder.

646
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:43,040
I'm only trying to help you out.

647
00:47:43,210 --> 00:47:47,000
I'm trying to keep you from getting hurt.
What more do you want me to do?

648
00:47:47,090 --> 00:47:48,960
-Much more.
-Wait a minute.

649
00:47:49,050 --> 00:47:50,670
Much, much, much more.

650
00:47:51,630 --> 00:47:53,430
Where are you going?

651
00:48:22,830 --> 00:48:26,040
Hi there, Johnny,
I was just coming over there.

652
00:48:27,290 --> 00:48:31,050
-Where were you, in Chicago?
-No, I was just on my way over there.

653
00:48:32,130 --> 00:48:34,510
How many times
you been knocked out, Terry?

654
00:48:34,590 --> 00:48:36,430
Knocked out? Two times.

655
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:38,560
That's once too often.

656
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:42,440
Your brains must be rattling.
What you got up there, Chinese bells?

657
00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:45,480
I thought you were gonna
keep an eye on that church meeting.

658
00:48:45,560 --> 00:48:48,020
I was there. Nothing was happening.

659
00:48:48,110 --> 00:48:51,240
Nothing happening!
Some operator you got yourself there.

660
00:48:51,320 --> 00:48:54,030
One more like him,
we'd all be wearing striped pyjamas.

661
00:48:54,110 --> 00:48:58,030
I'm telling you, Johnny, it was a
big nothing. The priest did all the talking.

662
00:48:58,120 --> 00:49:01,700
Half an hour later, a certain
Timothy J. Dugan had a secret session...

663
00:49:01,790 --> 00:49:05,460
...with the crime commission,
and he done all the talking.

664
00:49:06,670 --> 00:49:08,420
Dugan, what does he know?

665
00:49:08,790 --> 00:49:11,380
Just 39 pages of our operation, that's all.

666
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:15,430
Where'd you get that?

667
00:49:15,510 --> 00:49:18,720
-I got it.
-The complete works of Timothy J. Dugan.

668
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:24,600
I knew he had the guts, but I never--

669
00:49:24,690 --> 00:49:28,020
Guts! Why, that crummy pigeon.
He ought to have his neck wrung!

670
00:49:28,110 --> 00:49:31,690
That's what we get for mixing
with this punch-drunk brother of yours.

671
00:49:31,780 --> 00:49:34,360
He was good for laughs,
but this is business.

672
00:49:34,450 --> 00:49:36,910
I don't like anyone goofing off
in my business.

673
00:49:36,990 --> 00:49:39,910
-I wasn't--
-Why are you going around with his sister?

674
00:49:39,990 --> 00:49:41,370
Just shut up!

675
00:49:43,790 --> 00:49:47,120
It's just the Doyle broad,
she's got him so he doesn't...

676
00:49:47,210 --> 00:49:49,130
...know where his feet is anymore.

677
00:49:49,210 --> 00:49:51,130
It's an unhealthy relationship.

678
00:49:51,210 --> 00:49:54,300
-Definitely!
-Get rid of her...

679
00:49:54,380 --> 00:49:56,590
...unless you're both tired of living.

680
00:49:56,680 --> 00:49:58,180
-You got her address?
-Yeah.

681
00:49:58,260 --> 00:50:00,640
We've got to do something
to muzzle Dugan...

682
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:03,680
...or he'll raise the biggest stink
this town's ever seen.

683
00:50:03,770 --> 00:50:05,890
We got the best muscle on the waterfront.

684
00:50:05,980 --> 00:50:08,770
The time to use it is now.
Pronto, if not sooner.

685
00:50:08,850 --> 00:50:12,820
You know where you're going? Back in
the hold. No more cushy job in the loft.

686
00:50:12,900 --> 00:50:16,820
It's down in the hold with the sweat gang
till you learn your lesson.

687
00:50:21,910 --> 00:50:23,200
Let's go.

688
00:50:23,330 --> 00:50:24,870
Wise up!

689
00:51:04,830 --> 00:51:07,710
Come on, you're all right. Let's do it.

690
00:51:08,290 --> 00:51:10,080
At last an Irish shipment.

691
00:51:10,330 --> 00:51:14,040
And loaded to the gunnels
with fine Irish whiskey.

692
00:51:14,340 --> 00:51:17,340
You see, Kayo,
the good Lord takes care of us all the time.

693
00:51:17,420 --> 00:51:20,050
-That he does.
-Come on out, Kayo, get it up.

694
00:51:20,130 --> 00:51:22,510
All right, take it up. Take it away.

695
00:51:25,010 --> 00:51:27,220
And don't go walking off with any of that!

696
00:51:27,310 --> 00:51:30,100
You know how the boss feels
about individual pilferage.

697
00:51:30,190 --> 00:51:31,730
All right, all right.

698
00:51:32,310 --> 00:51:35,520
Now you see the advantage
of a little man in a big coat.

699
00:51:41,860 --> 00:51:44,950
-Let me see you a minute afterwards.
-What're you here for?

700
00:51:45,030 --> 00:51:48,290
To see that we don't steal
any of Mr. Friendly's precious cargo?

701
00:51:48,370 --> 00:51:51,120
-I want to talk to you.
-Get away from me, will you?

702
00:51:51,210 --> 00:51:53,580
All right. Take it up. Take it away.

703
00:52:07,560 --> 00:52:09,730
Kayo, you're a walking distillery.

704
00:52:18,230 --> 00:52:19,820
Watch it!

705
00:52:21,820 --> 00:52:23,030
Get a doctor!

706
00:52:23,570 --> 00:52:26,200
He don't need a doctor. He needs a priest.

707
00:52:42,260 --> 00:52:44,470
I came down here to keep a promise.

708
00:52:45,220 --> 00:52:47,930
I gave Kayo my word
that if he stood up to the Mob...

709
00:52:48,010 --> 00:52:50,890
...l'd stand up with him all the way.

710
00:52:52,020 --> 00:52:53,940
And now Kayo Dugan is dead.

711
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:57,650
He was one of those fellows
who had the gift for standing up.

712
00:52:57,730 --> 00:52:59,530
This time they fixed him.

713
00:52:59,610 --> 00:53:03,070
They fixed him for good this time,
unless it was an accident...

714
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:04,910
...like Big Mac says.

715
00:53:05,820 --> 00:53:09,490
Some people think the Crucifixion
only took place on Calvary.

716
00:53:09,580 --> 00:53:11,620
They better wise up.

717
00:53:12,120 --> 00:53:16,080
Taking Joey Doyle's life to stop him
from testifying is a crucifixion.

718
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:20,130
Dropping a sling on Kayo Dugan...

719
00:53:20,210 --> 00:53:23,130
...because he was ready
to spill his guts tomorrow...

720
00:53:23,220 --> 00:53:25,430
...that's a crucifixion.

721
00:53:26,550 --> 00:53:29,510
Every time the mob
puts the crusher on a good man...

722
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:34,100
...tries to stop him from doing his duty
as a citizen, it's a crucifixion.

723
00:53:34,190 --> 00:53:37,770
And anybody who sits around
and lets it happen...

724
00:53:37,860 --> 00:53:41,980
...keeps silent about something he knows
has happened, shares the guilt of it...

725
00:53:42,070 --> 00:53:44,110
...just as much as the Roman soldier...

726
00:53:44,200 --> 00:53:47,740
...who pierced the flesh of Our Lord
to see if He was dead.

727
00:53:51,870 --> 00:53:54,160
Go back to your church, Father.

728
00:53:54,250 --> 00:53:56,040
Boys, this is my church.

729
00:53:57,170 --> 00:54:00,250
If you don't think Christ is down here
on the waterfront...

730
00:54:00,340 --> 00:54:02,550
...you've got another guess coming!

731
00:54:02,920 --> 00:54:04,800
Get off this dock, Father!

732
00:54:05,670 --> 00:54:07,220
Tillio, don't do that.

733
00:54:07,300 --> 00:54:10,100
-Whose side are you on, boy?
-Let him finish.

734
00:54:10,220 --> 00:54:11,720
Every morning...

735
00:54:14,060 --> 00:54:16,730
...when the hiring boss blows his whistle...

736
00:54:17,690 --> 00:54:20,400
...Jesus stands alongside you
in the shape-up.

737
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:23,980
He sees why some of you get picked
and some of you get passed over.

738
00:54:24,070 --> 00:54:27,030
He sees the family men worrying
about getting their rent...

739
00:54:27,110 --> 00:54:29,530
...and getting food for the wife and kids.

740
00:54:29,620 --> 00:54:32,910
He sees you selling your souls
to the mob for a day's pay.

741
00:54:34,040 --> 00:54:36,580
The next bum that throws something
deals with me!

742
00:54:36,660 --> 00:54:38,620
I don't care if he's twice my size!

743
00:54:38,710 --> 00:54:41,170
What does Christ think
of the easy-money boys...

744
00:54:41,250 --> 00:54:43,750
...who do none of the work
and take all the gravy?

745
00:54:43,840 --> 00:54:46,800
How does he feel about
the fellows who wear $150 suits...

746
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:51,140
...and diamond rings on your union dues
and your kickback money?

747
00:54:52,220 --> 00:54:56,480
And how does He, who spoke up
without fear against every evil...

748
00:54:57,440 --> 00:54:59,150
...feel about your silence?

749
00:54:59,230 --> 00:55:00,940
Shut up about that!

750
00:55:01,060 --> 00:55:02,650
Just watch this.

751
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:09,450
You see that?

752
00:55:09,530 --> 00:55:12,120
You want to know what's wrong
with our waterfront?

753
00:55:12,200 --> 00:55:15,910
It's the love of a lousy buck.
It's making love of a buck, the cushy job...

754
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,040
...more important than the love of man.

755
00:55:18,120 --> 00:55:21,580
It's forgetting that every fellow
down here is your brother in Christ.

756
00:55:21,670 --> 00:55:23,750
But remember, Christ is always with you.

757
00:55:23,840 --> 00:55:26,710
Christ's in the shape-up,
in the hatch, in the union hall.

758
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:30,590
He's kneeling right here beside Dugan
and He's saying with all of you:

759
00:55:32,430 --> 00:55:35,430
"If you do it to the least of mine,
you do it to me."

760
00:55:36,430 --> 00:55:38,520
What they did to Joey and to Dugan...

761
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:42,230
...they're doing to you and you.

762
00:55:43,400 --> 00:55:44,520
All of you!

763
00:55:45,980 --> 00:55:49,700
And only you, only you with God's help...

764
00:55:49,780 --> 00:55:52,570
...have the power
to knock them out for good.

765
00:55:59,750 --> 00:56:01,540
Okay, Kayo.

766
00:56:16,680 --> 00:56:17,720
Amen.

767
00:56:21,940 --> 00:56:26,070
All right. Come on. Let's go. Break it up.
Let's go to work.

768
00:56:41,750 --> 00:56:45,630
Edie, here's Joey's jacket. I'm sure Kayo
would wish you to have it back.

769
00:58:03,660 --> 00:58:05,580
I brought you Joey's jacket.

770
00:58:06,370 --> 00:58:08,000
Yours is coming apart.

771
00:58:14,090 --> 00:58:15,220
Pigeons.

772
00:58:17,380 --> 00:58:18,840
They're nervous.

773
00:58:19,470 --> 00:58:21,810
There was a hawk around here before.

774
00:59:06,680 --> 00:59:09,150
Father, I want to speak to you a minute.

775
00:59:11,110 --> 00:59:12,900
Remember what you said about...

776
00:59:12,980 --> 00:59:16,240
...Kayo Dugan and keeping
your mouth shut when you know the score.

777
00:59:16,320 --> 00:59:18,280
I don't want to hear your confession.

778
00:59:18,360 --> 00:59:21,820
I'll dig it out for myself
and use it where it'll do the most good.

779
00:59:21,910 --> 00:59:25,080
-Father Gregory will hear you.
-I don't want to talk....

780
00:59:38,220 --> 00:59:40,050
Wait a second, wait a minute.

781
00:59:40,130 --> 00:59:42,510
I just want to talk to you one second.

782
00:59:43,720 --> 00:59:45,560
You've got to listen to me.

783
00:59:45,930 --> 00:59:48,930
I'm the one that set Joey Doyle up
for the knock off.

784
00:59:57,230 --> 01:00:00,700
Come on, take a walk with me, kid,
and give it to me straight.

785
01:00:04,030 --> 01:00:06,620
There's nothing I haven't heard. Come on.

786
01:00:19,670 --> 01:00:21,470
It started out as a favour.

787
01:00:21,590 --> 01:00:24,430
Favour, who am I kidding?
It's "do it or else."

788
01:00:24,510 --> 01:00:27,180
Believe me when I tell you
I just thought they were...

789
01:00:27,310 --> 01:00:30,680
...going to lean on him a bit.
I never thought he'd get knocked off.

790
01:00:30,770 --> 01:00:32,690
I tried to tell Edie the other night.

791
01:00:32,770 --> 01:00:34,860
I really tried to, I wanted to tell her.

792
01:00:34,940 --> 01:00:38,030
She's the first nice thing
that's ever happened to me.

793
01:00:38,570 --> 01:00:40,400
What are you going to do about it?

794
01:00:40,490 --> 01:00:42,530
What do you mean? About telling her?

795
01:00:42,610 --> 01:00:45,780
Yes, about telling her.
The commission. Your subpoena.

796
01:00:45,870 --> 01:00:47,410
I know you got a subpoena.

797
01:00:47,490 --> 01:00:48,740
I don't know.

798
01:00:49,370 --> 01:00:51,870
It's like carrying a monkey
around on your back.

799
01:00:51,960 --> 01:00:54,130
It's a question of "who rides who."

800
01:00:55,130 --> 01:00:57,670
If I spill, my life ain't worth a nickel.

801
01:00:57,960 --> 01:01:00,630
And how much is your soul worth
if you don't?

802
01:01:01,510 --> 01:01:04,640
They're asking me to put the finger
on my own brother.

803
01:01:05,850 --> 01:01:09,140
Johnny Friendly used to take me
to ball games when I was a kid.

804
01:01:09,220 --> 01:01:10,810
Don't break my heart.

805
01:01:11,270 --> 01:01:14,850
I wouldn't care if he gave you
a life pass to the polo grounds.

806
01:01:15,020 --> 01:01:17,940
So you've got a brother.
Let me tell you something...

807
01:01:18,020 --> 01:01:20,690
...you've got other brothers
getting the short hand...

808
01:01:20,780 --> 01:01:24,450
...while Johnny is getting mustard
on his face at the polo grounds.

809
01:01:24,530 --> 01:01:25,450
Ball games.

810
01:01:25,530 --> 01:01:28,280
Listen, if I were you, I would walk right....

811
01:01:30,620 --> 01:01:31,750
Never mind.

812
01:01:32,410 --> 01:01:36,670
I'm not asking you to do anything,
your own conscience has to do the asking.

813
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:38,130
Conscience.

814
01:01:40,170 --> 01:01:42,880
-That stuff can drive you nuts.
-Good luck.

815
01:01:44,130 --> 01:01:46,140
Is that all you've got to say?

816
01:01:47,930 --> 01:01:49,050
Come here.

817
01:01:52,810 --> 01:01:54,730
Edie called me this morning.

818
01:01:55,190 --> 01:01:57,270
She's coming here to talk to me.

819
01:01:59,570 --> 01:02:01,650
Come on, why don't you tell her?

820
01:02:03,990 --> 01:02:05,110
No curves.

821
01:02:09,160 --> 01:02:10,280
Okay.

822
01:02:12,750 --> 01:02:13,910
Thanks.

823
01:02:52,280 --> 01:02:54,410
-You?
-Honest to God, Edie....

824
01:03:05,170 --> 01:03:07,420
Believe me, I swear to God, Edie....

825
01:04:01,270 --> 01:04:03,610
Terry, guess who's here?

826
01:04:03,690 --> 01:04:06,530
That joker
from the crime commissioner's office.

827
01:04:27,550 --> 01:04:30,050
Suppose I knew a guy
that knocked somebody off...

828
01:04:30,130 --> 01:04:32,050
...you think I ought to turn him in?

829
01:04:32,130 --> 01:04:34,510
You mean call a cop? Are you kidding?

830
01:04:34,600 --> 01:04:36,640
You don't think I ought to turn him in?

831
01:04:36,720 --> 01:04:38,720
You was a Golden Warrior once.

832
01:04:39,640 --> 01:04:40,890
That's right.

833
01:04:42,940 --> 01:04:44,520
You started the gang.

834
01:05:07,250 --> 01:05:08,750
You looking for me?

835
01:05:09,050 --> 01:05:12,130
No, not exactly.
I was just resting my dogs a minute.

836
01:05:12,420 --> 01:05:16,890
On the next investigation we get, I hope
it's got buildings with elevators in them.

837
01:05:16,970 --> 01:05:19,640
So far this one's just been climbing stairs.

838
01:05:20,220 --> 01:05:22,060
What do you climb them for?

839
01:05:22,180 --> 01:05:25,020
It's worth it if we can tell
the waterfront story...

840
01:05:25,100 --> 01:05:27,610
...the way the people
have a right to hear it.

841
01:05:27,690 --> 01:05:29,070
Don't you think?

842
01:05:48,380 --> 01:05:51,260
Didn't I see you in the Garden
three or four years ago...

843
01:05:51,340 --> 01:05:53,340
...with a fellow named Wilson?

844
01:05:55,800 --> 01:05:58,390
I thought you were going
to take him that night.

845
01:05:58,470 --> 01:06:00,260
Man, he really dumped you.

846
01:06:01,970 --> 01:06:03,310
He dumped me?

847
01:06:06,770 --> 01:06:10,690
What would you say if I told you
I held that bum up for half a round?

848
01:06:11,440 --> 01:06:14,030
I could see he was hurt.

849
01:06:14,990 --> 01:06:18,450
What did you think I was doing
with them combinations, petting him?

850
01:06:18,530 --> 01:06:20,370
You just couldn't finish him off?

851
01:06:20,450 --> 01:06:22,240
Don't monkey around there.

852
01:06:23,160 --> 01:06:24,910
Why didn't you finish him off?

853
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:28,830
-I was doing a favour for some pals.
-Favour?

854
01:06:30,880 --> 01:06:32,340
That's the way it was.

855
01:06:32,420 --> 01:06:34,050
That's the way it was.

856
01:06:34,130 --> 01:06:36,880
If I'd have put him down,
I'd have had a title shot.

857
01:06:36,970 --> 01:06:38,470
I was ready that night.

858
01:06:38,550 --> 01:06:41,430
You sure looked it.
That's when I figured it was all over.

859
01:06:41,510 --> 01:06:44,100
It was all over, except for the lousy bet!

860
01:06:44,270 --> 01:06:45,520
-My own.
-Yeah.

861
01:06:51,270 --> 01:06:53,230
I guess I'd better get going.

862
01:06:53,690 --> 01:06:55,400
Hit those stairs again.

863
01:06:57,910 --> 01:07:01,700
Was that a hook or an uppercut
you caught him with that first time?

864
01:07:02,790 --> 01:07:05,580
I didn't use no hooks.
I was strictly a short puncher.

865
01:07:05,660 --> 01:07:07,290
It looked like a hook to me.

866
01:07:07,370 --> 01:07:10,840
I had that bum all figured out.
He had a good left hand.

867
01:07:10,920 --> 01:07:14,050
I let him tag me
with the left hand for a couple of rounds...

868
01:07:14,130 --> 01:07:18,180
...so just when he starts, he thinks
he's getting cute, I step inside a jab...

869
01:07:18,260 --> 01:07:20,680
...with a left, with a right, with a left.

870
01:07:20,760 --> 01:07:24,310
I had him in my arms
and from there on in we were just dancing.

871
01:07:24,390 --> 01:07:25,850
And that's a fact!

872
01:07:26,350 --> 01:07:30,150
When those guys want to win a bet,
there's nothing they won't stop at.

873
01:07:33,820 --> 01:07:35,360
I didn't hear them, boss...

874
01:07:35,440 --> 01:07:38,110
...but I seen them nose to nose,
like pair of lovers.

875
01:07:38,200 --> 01:07:39,910
The flatfoot was eating it up.

876
01:07:39,990 --> 01:07:43,080
So they've been seen together
and he smiled at her.

877
01:07:43,160 --> 01:07:45,120
That doesn't mean he's going to talk.

878
01:07:45,200 --> 01:07:48,330
There is no evidence
until he gives public testimony.

879
01:07:48,410 --> 01:07:50,750
Thanks for the legal advice, Charley.

880
01:07:51,210 --> 01:07:53,340
That's what we kept you around here for.

881
01:07:53,420 --> 01:07:55,800
How do we keep him
from giving this testimony?

882
01:07:55,880 --> 01:07:59,340
Ain't that what you call
"the main order of business"?

883
01:07:59,430 --> 01:08:00,800
He's a good kid.

884
01:08:01,010 --> 01:08:02,600
-You know that.
-He's a bum.

885
01:08:02,680 --> 01:08:05,930
After all the days I gave him in the loft,
he's got no gratitude.

886
01:08:06,020 --> 01:08:07,100
Shut up!

887
01:08:08,350 --> 01:08:10,730
I'm conducting this investigation.

888
01:08:14,190 --> 01:08:16,690
This girl and the father,
they got their hooks...

889
01:08:16,780 --> 01:08:20,360
...in the kid so deep he doesn't
even know which end is up any more.

890
01:08:20,450 --> 01:08:22,820
I ain't interested in his mental condition.

891
01:08:22,910 --> 01:08:26,080
All I want to know is:
is he D and D or is he a canary?

892
01:08:28,790 --> 01:08:31,420
-I wish I knew.
-So do l, Charley.

893
01:08:32,460 --> 01:08:33,710
For your sake.

894
01:08:40,420 --> 01:08:41,880
What do you want me to do?

895
01:08:41,970 --> 01:08:45,050
It's simple. Drive him out
to this place we've been using...

896
01:08:45,140 --> 01:08:49,180
...try to straighten him out on the way.
If you don't, give him to Gerry G.

897
01:08:49,270 --> 01:08:50,730
You can't do that.

898
01:08:51,520 --> 01:08:55,480
Maybe the boy is out of line,
but he's just a confused kid!

899
01:08:55,560 --> 01:08:57,070
Confused kid!

900
01:09:00,400 --> 01:09:03,280
First he crosses me in public
and gets away with it...

901
01:09:03,360 --> 01:09:06,870
...then the next joker, pretty soon
I'm just another fellow around here!

902
01:09:06,950 --> 01:09:08,990
Johnny, I can't do that.

903
01:09:14,040 --> 01:09:15,210
Then don't.

904
01:09:25,720 --> 01:09:28,600
-Who do you like in the third?
-lt's got to be New Hope.

905
01:09:28,680 --> 01:09:29,850
Definitely.

906
01:09:33,980 --> 01:09:35,060
Johnny...

907
01:09:36,770 --> 01:09:38,440
...it's my kid brother.

908
01:09:38,520 --> 01:09:40,480
That's for you to figure out.

909
01:09:40,570 --> 01:09:43,200
You can have it your way
or you can have it his way...

910
01:09:43,280 --> 01:09:45,910
...but you can't have it both ways.
Am I right, Truck?

911
01:09:45,990 --> 01:09:47,160
Definitely.

912
01:09:48,990 --> 01:09:50,620
Okay, on your horse...

913
01:09:52,500 --> 01:09:53,870
...deep thinker.

914
01:10:25,740 --> 01:10:26,610
Hi, Charley.

915
01:10:27,200 --> 01:10:30,740
I'm glad you stopped by for me.
I've been wanting to talk to you.

916
01:10:30,830 --> 01:10:32,410
-Sure, kid.
-Where to?

917
01:10:32,500 --> 01:10:34,910
Go to River St. I'll tell you where to stop.

918
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:37,000
I thought we was going to the Garden?

919
01:10:37,080 --> 01:10:39,710
We are, but I want to cover a bet
on the way over.

920
01:10:39,790 --> 01:10:42,460
Besides, this'll give us a chance to talk.

921
01:10:43,090 --> 01:10:45,800
Nobody ever stopped you
from talking, Charley.

922
01:10:49,220 --> 01:10:51,810
The grapevine says that
you got a subpoena.

923
01:10:53,020 --> 01:10:55,270
The guys know you're not a cheese-eater.

924
01:10:55,350 --> 01:10:58,150
They think you shouldn't be
on the outside so much...

925
01:10:58,230 --> 01:11:02,070
...but a little on the inside.
I have a few things for you at the docks.

926
01:11:03,230 --> 01:11:04,530
A steady job...

927
01:11:05,110 --> 01:11:07,860
...a couple extra potatoes, that's all I want.

928
01:11:08,450 --> 01:11:10,490
That's great when you're a kid, but...

929
01:11:10,570 --> 01:11:13,240
...you're getting on,
you're pushing 30, slugger.

930
01:11:13,330 --> 01:11:16,540
You know it's time to think
about getting some ambition.

931
01:11:18,540 --> 01:11:21,840
I always figured I'd live
a little bit longer without it.

932
01:11:24,260 --> 01:11:25,590
Maybe.

933
01:11:32,220 --> 01:11:36,430
There's a boss loader slot that's
open on the new pier we're opening up.

934
01:11:37,600 --> 01:11:40,020
It pays six cents on every...

935
01:11:40,350 --> 01:11:43,940
...100 pounds that goes in
and every 100 pounds that goes out...

936
01:11:44,020 --> 01:11:46,030
...and you don't have to lift a finger.

937
01:11:46,110 --> 01:11:48,820
That's $200, $300, $400 a week.

938
01:11:49,030 --> 01:11:51,910
$400 a week just for the openers.

939
01:11:52,620 --> 01:11:55,120
I get all that dough for not doing nothing?

940
01:11:55,200 --> 01:11:58,080
You don't do anything
and you don't say anything.

941
01:11:58,910 --> 01:12:00,210
You understand?

942
01:12:05,840 --> 01:12:08,510
There's more to this
than I thought, Charley.

943
01:12:09,760 --> 01:12:11,970
I'm telling you there's a lot more.

944
01:12:13,050 --> 01:12:16,720
You're not thinking of testifying against
some people that we might know?

945
01:12:16,810 --> 01:12:18,430
I don't know, Charley.

946
01:12:19,140 --> 01:12:21,400
That's what I want to talk to you about.

947
01:12:21,480 --> 01:12:25,440
Do you know how much the piers are
worth that we control through the local?

948
01:12:25,520 --> 01:12:28,570
Do you think Johnny's going to jeopardise
the whole set-up...

949
01:12:28,650 --> 01:12:32,820
...for one rubber-lipped, ex-tanker
who's walking on his heels? What the....

950
01:12:32,910 --> 01:12:34,910
I could've been a lot better.

951
01:12:34,990 --> 01:12:37,120
The point is we don't have much time!

952
01:12:37,200 --> 01:12:39,750
I'm telling you,
I haven't made up my mind yet!

953
01:12:39,830 --> 01:12:42,880
Make up your mind
before we get to 437 River St!

954
01:12:51,090 --> 01:12:53,180
Before we get to where, Charley?

955
01:12:58,640 --> 01:13:02,190
Listen, Terry.
Take the job, no questions. Take it!

956
01:13:04,940 --> 01:13:07,070
Terry, take this job, please.

957
01:13:38,470 --> 01:13:39,720
Look, kid....

958
01:13:43,940 --> 01:13:45,940
How much do you weigh, slugger?

959
01:13:47,940 --> 01:13:50,650
When you weighed 168 pounds...

960
01:13:51,990 --> 01:13:53,610
...you were beautiful.

961
01:13:55,740 --> 01:13:58,160
You could have been another Billy Conn.

962
01:14:00,410 --> 01:14:02,660
That skunk we got you for a manager...

963
01:14:03,870 --> 01:14:05,880
...he brought you along too fast.

964
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,550
It wasn't him, Charley. It was you.

965
01:14:10,670 --> 01:14:12,470
Remember that night in the Garden?

966
01:14:12,550 --> 01:14:16,470
You came down to my dressing room
and said, "Kid, this ain't your night.

967
01:14:16,550 --> 01:14:18,800
"We're going for the price on Wilson."

968
01:14:19,640 --> 01:14:21,100
You remember that?

969
01:14:22,180 --> 01:14:23,810
"This ain't your night."

970
01:14:24,690 --> 01:14:27,610
My night! I could have taken Wilson apart!

971
01:14:28,980 --> 01:14:32,320
So what happens, he gets the title shot
outdoors in the ball park...

972
01:14:32,400 --> 01:14:35,570
...and what do I get?
A one-way ticket to Palookaville!

973
01:14:35,650 --> 01:14:37,410
You was my brother, Charley.

974
01:14:37,490 --> 01:14:40,080
You should have looked out
for me a little bit.

975
01:14:40,160 --> 01:14:43,000
You should've taken care of me
a little so I wouldn't...

976
01:14:43,080 --> 01:14:45,500
...have to take dives for short-end money.

977
01:14:45,580 --> 01:14:48,080
I had some bets down for you.
You saw some money.

978
01:14:48,170 --> 01:14:50,920
You don't understand,
I could have had class!

979
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:53,010
I could have been a contender.

980
01:14:53,210 --> 01:14:55,050
I could have been somebody.

981
01:14:56,180 --> 01:14:57,680
Instead of a bum...

982
01:14:58,220 --> 01:15:00,600
...which is what I am. Let's face it.

983
01:15:05,770 --> 01:15:07,310
It was you, Charley!

984
01:15:14,780 --> 01:15:15,820
Okay.

985
01:15:19,950 --> 01:15:21,370
I'll tell them...

986
01:15:22,660 --> 01:15:24,500
...I couldn't find you.

987
01:15:24,580 --> 01:15:26,750
Ten to one they won't believe me.

988
01:15:33,050 --> 01:15:34,550
Here, you take this.

989
01:15:36,260 --> 01:15:37,970
You're going to need it.

990
01:15:39,930 --> 01:15:41,220
You, pull over.

991
01:15:51,610 --> 01:15:53,230
Take me to the Garden.

992
01:16:32,900 --> 01:16:34,650
Stay away from me!

993
01:16:40,320 --> 01:16:41,200
Edie?

994
01:16:43,280 --> 01:16:45,620
Come on, open the door, please!

995
01:16:45,700 --> 01:16:46,740
Stop it!

996
01:16:50,460 --> 01:16:52,170
I want you to stay away from me.

997
01:16:52,250 --> 01:16:55,460
I know what you want me to do
but I ain't doing it, so forget it.

998
01:16:55,540 --> 01:16:57,630
I don't want you to do anything.

999
01:16:57,760 --> 01:17:00,130
You let your conscience
tell you what to do.

1000
01:17:00,220 --> 01:17:03,220
Shut up about that conscience,
that's all I've been hearing!

1001
01:17:03,300 --> 01:17:06,720
I never mentioned the word before.
You just stay away from me!

1002
01:17:06,810 --> 01:17:08,560
Edie, you love me.

1003
01:17:09,560 --> 01:17:13,350
I didn't say I didn't love you,
I said stay away from me!

1004
01:17:13,440 --> 01:17:16,270
-I want you to stay with me.
-Stay away from me!

1005
01:17:50,520 --> 01:17:51,930
Terry!

1006
01:17:53,600 --> 01:17:58,320
Terry, your brother's down here!
He wants to see you!

1007
01:18:00,730 --> 01:18:01,780
Charley?

1008
01:18:12,120 --> 01:18:13,910
Your brother's down here.

1009
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:16,500
Come on down here.

1010
01:18:16,750 --> 01:18:18,290
He wants to see you.

1011
01:18:22,800 --> 01:18:24,180
Come on down!

1012
01:18:25,760 --> 01:18:28,550
-What is it Terry?
-Charley, he's in trouble.

1013
01:18:28,720 --> 01:18:29,890
Be careful.

1014
01:18:37,650 --> 01:18:38,690
Charley!

1015
01:18:39,360 --> 01:18:40,480
Terry?

1016
01:18:41,440 --> 01:18:45,910
Terry! Your brother's down here!

1017
01:18:48,280 --> 01:18:50,080
Do you hear what I hear?

1018
01:18:51,990 --> 01:18:53,040
Terry!

1019
01:19:07,300 --> 01:19:10,680
That's the same way they called Andy,
the night I lost him.

1020
01:19:11,220 --> 01:19:13,890
Edie, be careful! Edie, be careful!

1021
01:21:09,550 --> 01:21:10,970
They got Charley.

1022
01:21:11,430 --> 01:21:14,220
Terry, I'm frightened.
Let's get out of here, please.

1023
01:21:14,300 --> 01:21:17,310
First Joey, then Dugan,
and now Charley, and next....

1024
01:21:17,640 --> 01:21:20,310
Please, Terry,
some place where we can live in peace.

1025
01:21:20,390 --> 01:21:23,310
I'm going to take it out of their skulls.

1026
01:21:27,190 --> 01:21:28,320
Charley...

1027
01:21:31,360 --> 01:21:34,030
...l'm going to take it out of their skulls.

1028
01:21:34,240 --> 01:21:36,240
Terry, they'll kill you, too.

1029
01:21:36,830 --> 01:21:39,870
Go get the father.
Tell him to take care of Charley.

1030
01:21:40,660 --> 01:21:43,750
And then come back here
and stay with him till he gets here.

1031
01:21:43,830 --> 01:21:46,630
Terry, please don't do anything, please!

1032
01:21:48,590 --> 01:21:51,420
For God's sake,
don't leave him alone here long!

1033
01:21:53,550 --> 01:21:55,760
-Please, Terry.
-Do what I tell you.

1034
01:22:20,870 --> 01:22:23,460
-Where's John Friendly?
-He's not here now.

1035
01:23:01,700 --> 01:23:03,000
Give me a shot.

1036
01:23:03,750 --> 01:23:04,870
Take it easy.

1037
01:23:04,960 --> 01:23:07,500
Don't give me no advice, give me the shot.

1038
01:23:13,170 --> 01:23:15,760
Why don't you go home
before Big John gets here?

1039
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:17,590
Just give me a whiskey.

1040
01:23:24,390 --> 01:23:26,270
Stick around, Tillio.

1041
01:23:32,150 --> 01:23:33,530
There, sit down.

1042
01:23:44,910 --> 01:23:46,830
Get out of that phone booth!

1043
01:24:09,190 --> 01:24:11,110
Stay where you are!

1044
01:24:18,450 --> 01:24:20,200
I want to see you, Terry.

1045
01:24:20,410 --> 01:24:22,200
I'm right in front of you.

1046
01:24:26,160 --> 01:24:28,330
Don't give me a hard time, Terry.

1047
01:24:33,340 --> 01:24:34,750
What do you want?

1048
01:24:37,550 --> 01:24:38,670
Your gun.

1049
01:24:38,800 --> 01:24:40,430
Go and chase yourself.

1050
01:24:40,510 --> 01:24:41,590
Give me the gun.

1051
01:24:41,680 --> 01:24:42,930
You go to hell.

1052
01:24:44,970 --> 01:24:46,970
-What did you say?
-Go to hell.

1053
01:24:52,100 --> 01:24:55,110
-Sorry, let me help you up.
-Get your hands off me!

1054
01:24:55,230 --> 01:24:57,110
Now what am I going to do?

1055
01:24:57,190 --> 01:25:00,110
You want to be a brave man
by firing lead into another man?

1056
01:25:00,200 --> 01:25:02,660
-lt's none of your business!
-That's being brave!

1057
01:25:02,740 --> 01:25:04,200
Mind your own business!

1058
01:25:04,280 --> 01:25:06,370
Shooting a man isn't being brave!

1059
01:25:06,450 --> 01:25:08,000
It's none of your business!

1060
01:25:08,080 --> 01:25:10,330
Do you want to hurt Johnny Friendly?

1061
01:25:11,750 --> 01:25:13,460
Do you want to fix him?

1062
01:25:13,960 --> 01:25:16,630
-Do you really want to finish him?
-What do you think?

1063
01:25:16,710 --> 01:25:19,220
For what he did to Charley
and a dozen other men?

1064
01:25:19,300 --> 01:25:23,390
Don't fight him like a hoodlum down here
in the jungle. That's what he wants.

1065
01:25:23,470 --> 01:25:26,350
He'll hit you in the head
and plead self-defence.

1066
01:25:26,640 --> 01:25:29,730
You'll fight him in the courtroom
tomorrow with the truth.

1067
01:25:29,810 --> 01:25:31,390
As you know the truth.

1068
01:25:39,990 --> 01:25:41,860
Now you get rid of that gun.

1069
01:25:41,950 --> 01:25:45,490
Unless you haven't the guts,
and if you haven't, hold onto it!

1070
01:25:50,450 --> 01:25:51,750
Give me a beer.

1071
01:26:01,670 --> 01:26:03,800
Do you want a beer? Make it two.

1072
01:26:43,760 --> 01:26:46,890
You mean to sit there and tell me
that your local takes in...

1073
01:26:46,970 --> 01:26:50,060
...$65,500 every year...

1074
01:26:50,600 --> 01:26:52,640
...and keeps no financial records?

1075
01:26:52,730 --> 01:26:54,480
Sure. We got records.

1076
01:26:54,560 --> 01:26:55,850
Where are they?

1077
01:26:56,150 --> 01:26:59,230
We was robbed last night,
and we can't find no books.

1078
01:27:00,270 --> 01:27:02,440
-You know you're under oath?
-Sure.

1079
01:27:11,410 --> 01:27:14,460
Isn't it odd to you that
five different waterfront locals...

1080
01:27:14,540 --> 01:27:16,540
...were broken into last night?

1081
01:27:16,620 --> 01:27:20,540
And the only item missing from all
of them was the financial records?

1082
01:27:20,630 --> 01:27:23,760
What do you mean, odd?
Like I told you, we was robbed.

1083
01:27:29,970 --> 01:27:31,560
That's all for now.

1084
01:27:36,560 --> 01:27:38,190
Call the next witness.

1085
01:27:39,980 --> 01:27:41,820
Before you call the next witness...

1086
01:27:41,900 --> 01:27:45,530
...are all the officers of Local 374
present this morning?

1087
01:27:47,490 --> 01:27:50,780
Will the following please rise
as their names are called?

1088
01:27:51,160 --> 01:27:54,790
Mr. Michael J. Skelly,
also known as Johnny Friendly, President.

1089
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:59,330
Mr. Lewis O. Janotta, Vice President.

1090
01:28:00,710 --> 01:28:04,000
Mr. Daniel D. Coogan, Financial Secretary.

1091
01:28:04,760 --> 01:28:06,920
Mr. Mladen Sokolivitch, Delegate.

1092
01:28:07,220 --> 01:28:09,470
Mr. Tillio A. Rodelli, Delegate.

1093
01:28:09,550 --> 01:28:11,390
Recording Secretary.

1094
01:28:16,230 --> 01:28:17,350
Thank you, gentlemen.

1095
01:28:17,440 --> 01:28:19,440
-Next witness.
-Mr. Malloy.

1096
01:28:31,410 --> 01:28:32,830
Raise your right hand.

1097
01:28:32,910 --> 01:28:35,290
-Name, please.
-Terry Malloy.

1098
01:28:35,370 --> 01:28:38,250
Swear to tell the truth, the whole truth,
and only the truth?

1099
01:28:38,330 --> 01:28:39,170
-Right.
-I do.

1100
01:28:39,670 --> 01:28:41,080
-I do.
-Be seated, please.

1101
01:28:42,880 --> 01:28:44,250
Mr. Malloy...

1102
01:28:44,840 --> 01:28:47,880
...is it true that the night Joey Doyle
was found dead...

1103
01:28:47,970 --> 01:28:51,550
...you were the last one to see him
before he was pushed from the roof?

1104
01:28:51,640 --> 01:28:52,720
Yes.

1105
01:28:52,800 --> 01:28:54,720
Is it true you went immediately--

1106
01:28:54,810 --> 01:28:57,180
Wait! Except for the guys
that pushed him off.

1107
01:28:57,270 --> 01:29:00,020
Is it true you went
immediately to the Friendly bar...

1108
01:29:00,100 --> 01:29:03,810
...and expressed your feelings
about the murder to Mr. Johnny Friendly?

1109
01:29:03,900 --> 01:29:05,270
John Friendly, right.

1110
01:29:05,360 --> 01:29:06,610
Mr. Malloy...

1111
01:29:07,070 --> 01:29:10,700
...can you tell me whether
Mr. Friendly, or I should say, Mr. Skelly...

1112
01:29:10,780 --> 01:29:14,950
...said anything to you to indicate his
responsibility in getting rid of Joey Doyle?

1113
01:29:15,030 --> 01:29:15,830
Right.

1114
01:29:15,910 --> 01:29:19,120
Would you say
that Mr. Friendly made it clear to you...

1115
01:29:19,250 --> 01:29:22,370
...it was absolutely necessary
he murder Joey Doyle in order...

1116
01:29:22,460 --> 01:29:24,210
...to maintain his control...

1117
01:29:24,290 --> 01:29:27,630
...on the docks of the waterfront localsl
Is that correct?

1118
01:29:27,710 --> 01:29:29,420
Will there be anything else?

1119
01:29:29,510 --> 01:29:32,340
Yes, Sidney, if Mr. Friendly calls, I'm out.

1120
01:29:33,050 --> 01:29:35,640
-Anytime today?
-lf he calls ever, I'm out!

1121
01:29:35,810 --> 01:29:36,930
Very well.

1122
01:29:37,890 --> 01:29:39,600
Thank you, Mr. Malloy.

1123
01:29:40,310 --> 01:29:43,150
You've done more
than break the Joey Doyle case.

1124
01:29:44,940 --> 01:29:48,280
We've begun to make it possible
for honest men to work the docks...

1125
01:29:48,360 --> 01:29:50,780
...with job security and peace of mind.

1126
01:29:52,820 --> 01:29:55,240
You may step down. That's all for now.

1127
01:29:56,780 --> 01:29:58,790
Mr. Michael J. Skelly, please.

1128
01:30:10,050 --> 01:30:12,340
You just dug your own grave. Go fall in it.

1129
01:30:12,420 --> 01:30:15,090
You're dead on this waterfront
and every waterfront...

1130
01:30:15,180 --> 01:30:16,890
...from Boston to New Orleans.

1131
01:30:16,970 --> 01:30:18,930
You don't drive a truck or a cab...

1132
01:30:19,010 --> 01:30:22,980
...you don't push a baggage rack
you don't work no place, you're dead!

1133
01:30:40,870 --> 01:30:44,170
Will you quit following me?
Why don't you get off my tail?

1134
01:30:44,250 --> 01:30:47,380
Orders. You're hot.
You ought to be glad we're following you.

1135
01:30:47,460 --> 01:30:49,090
You're making me feel like a canary.

1136
01:30:49,170 --> 01:30:50,500
-Well....
-Lay off.

1137
01:30:54,010 --> 01:30:55,380
Hi, Cheeky.

1138
01:30:57,800 --> 01:30:59,560
Who's your friend?

1139
01:31:32,840 --> 01:31:35,970
I made some hot coffee.
I thought you might want some.

1140
01:31:40,300 --> 01:31:42,060
Anyway, it's all over.

1141
01:31:43,720 --> 01:31:45,980
My friends don't want to talk to me.

1142
01:31:46,140 --> 01:31:48,310
Are you sure they're your friends?

1143
01:31:56,320 --> 01:31:57,820
I'll see you later.

1144
01:32:13,960 --> 01:32:15,840
Hey, champ, how's the kid.

1145
01:32:19,890 --> 01:32:21,350
What's with him?

1146
01:32:36,490 --> 01:32:38,570
A pigeon for a pigeon!

1147
01:33:08,850 --> 01:33:09,890
Terry.

1148
01:33:26,200 --> 01:33:27,200
The kid.

1149
01:33:30,580 --> 01:33:31,620
Tommy?

1150
01:33:34,420 --> 01:33:36,500
What did he have to do that for?

1151
01:33:38,380 --> 01:33:39,840
Every one of them.

1152
01:33:41,300 --> 01:33:45,050
Terry, there's no place that's safe
for you now on the waterfront.

1153
01:33:45,850 --> 01:33:47,140
Maybe inland...

1154
01:33:47,560 --> 01:33:49,310
...out west some place...

1155
01:33:49,390 --> 01:33:50,520
...a farm.

1156
01:33:51,770 --> 01:33:52,810
A farm?

1157
01:33:53,310 --> 01:33:57,610
You could do anything, as long as
you're away from Johnny Friendly.

1158
01:33:57,690 --> 01:33:59,990
You tried to help the longshoremen...

1159
01:34:00,070 --> 01:34:03,490
...and they just turn their backs
and stick to their stupid D and D!

1160
01:34:03,570 --> 01:34:06,780
Are they taking chances for you?
Why should you?

1161
01:34:07,080 --> 01:34:09,620
You're not even listening to me, are you?

1162
01:34:17,670 --> 01:34:19,380
You're going down there.

1163
01:34:20,210 --> 01:34:23,970
Just because Johnny Friendly warned you
not to, you're going down there.

1164
01:34:24,050 --> 01:34:27,760
You think you got to prove
that you're not afraid of them!

1165
01:34:27,850 --> 01:34:29,850
Well, go ahead, get it over with.

1166
01:34:29,930 --> 01:34:33,100
Go down and get yourself killed
you stupid, pigheaded....

1167
01:34:33,190 --> 01:34:35,270
What are you trying to prove?

1168
01:34:38,520 --> 01:34:40,480
They always said I was a bum.

1169
01:34:42,360 --> 01:34:44,160
Well, I ain't a bum, Edie.

1170
01:34:45,570 --> 01:34:48,160
Don't worry, I'm not going to hurt nobody.

1171
01:34:48,700 --> 01:34:50,870
I'm just going to go down there...

1172
01:34:51,290 --> 01:34:52,870
...and get my rights.

1173
01:35:39,670 --> 01:35:41,750
Everybody works today!

1174
01:36:00,730 --> 01:36:01,770
Wolfgang.

1175
01:36:02,980 --> 01:36:04,110
Hendricks.

1176
01:36:04,940 --> 01:36:06,150
Padowski.

1177
01:36:07,530 --> 01:36:08,570
Martin.

1178
01:36:09,490 --> 01:36:10,530
Dalton.

1179
01:36:10,780 --> 01:36:11,830
Wurthy.

1180
01:36:12,540 --> 01:36:13,620
Hauffman.

1181
01:36:16,080 --> 01:36:19,710
-What do you think?
-That ain't such a bad picture of you, boss.

1182
01:36:19,830 --> 01:36:22,170
Stop breathing that clam sauce on me.

1183
01:36:23,380 --> 01:36:26,130
I wish you'd let me
go to work on that cheese-eater.

1184
01:36:26,220 --> 01:36:27,970
I'd top the bum off lovely.

1185
01:36:28,050 --> 01:36:30,260
Wait'll we get off this front page.

1186
01:36:30,340 --> 01:36:31,640
Then he's mine.

1187
01:36:32,430 --> 01:36:33,600
I want him.

1188
01:36:34,680 --> 01:36:36,480
You hear that? He's mine.

1189
01:36:42,520 --> 01:36:46,150
Where are them cops of yours, stoolie?
You're going to need them.

1190
01:36:51,820 --> 01:36:54,160
You're still short in the hatch, Mac.

1191
01:36:55,950 --> 01:36:58,660
Spec. Bring me the first man you see.

1192
01:37:00,420 --> 01:37:01,460
You.

1193
01:37:05,800 --> 01:37:07,970
Here's your man.

1194
01:37:10,840 --> 01:37:13,550
You want more of the same?
Come back tomorrow.

1195
01:37:17,060 --> 01:37:18,520
All right, that's it.

1196
01:37:40,960 --> 01:37:45,380
I hope that bum comes down here.
I'd love if he comes down here.

1197
01:37:46,210 --> 01:37:48,300
Did you ever hear of the Sullivan Law?

1198
01:37:48,380 --> 01:37:51,760
They'll be down on us for
the slightest infraction now, anything.

1199
01:37:51,840 --> 01:37:53,760
I'm going to be indicted any minute!

1200
01:37:53,840 --> 01:37:56,060
Come on, gimme.

1201
01:37:58,100 --> 01:38:00,180
Will you get it through your heads...

1202
01:38:00,270 --> 01:38:02,900
...they're dusting off the hot seat for me!

1203
01:38:05,560 --> 01:38:07,690
We're a law-abiding union.

1204
01:38:08,150 --> 01:38:09,320
Understand?

1205
01:38:46,270 --> 01:38:47,770
Friendly!

1206
01:38:49,110 --> 01:38:51,280
John Friendly, come out of there!

1207
01:38:57,990 --> 01:39:00,080
You want to know the trouble with you?

1208
01:39:00,160 --> 01:39:03,460
You think it makes you a big man
if you give the answers.

1209
01:39:03,540 --> 01:39:06,500
At the right time I'll catch up with you.
Think about that.

1210
01:39:06,580 --> 01:39:09,710
-Now, go on, beat it. Don't push your luck.
-Wait a minute.

1211
01:39:09,800 --> 01:39:13,470
You take them heaters away from you
and you're nothing, you know that?

1212
01:39:13,550 --> 01:39:15,470
You'll talk yourself in the river!

1213
01:39:15,550 --> 01:39:18,390
You take the good goods away
and the kickbacks...

1214
01:39:18,470 --> 01:39:21,850
...and shakedown cabbage
and the pistoleros and you're nothing!

1215
01:39:21,930 --> 01:39:25,140
Your guts is all in your wallet
and your trigger finger!

1216
01:39:25,350 --> 01:39:27,060
You ratted on us, Terry!

1217
01:39:27,270 --> 01:39:30,520
From where you stand, maybe.
But I'm standing over here now!

1218
01:39:30,610 --> 01:39:34,150
I was ratting on myself all them years,
I didn't even know it.

1219
01:39:34,320 --> 01:39:36,610
You gave it to Joey, you gave it to Dugan...

1220
01:39:36,700 --> 01:39:39,490
...and you gave it to Charley
who was one of your own.

1221
01:39:39,580 --> 01:39:42,580
You think you're God Almighty,
but you know what you are?

1222
01:39:42,660 --> 01:39:44,040
You're a cheap...

1223
01:39:44,120 --> 01:39:46,750
...lousy, dirty, stinking mug...

1224
01:39:47,120 --> 01:39:49,340
...and I'm glad what I done to you!

1225
01:39:49,630 --> 01:39:50,880
You hear that?

1226
01:39:50,960 --> 01:39:52,760
I'm glad what I done!

1227
01:39:53,630 --> 01:39:56,220
And I'm going to keep on doing it till I get--

1228
01:39:57,300 --> 01:39:58,010
Come on, come on.

1229
01:40:27,120 --> 01:40:29,210
That boy fights like he used to.

1230
01:40:40,850 --> 01:40:43,060
-They'll kill him.
-lt's a massacre.

1231
01:40:43,140 --> 01:40:45,060
He's one of theirs anyway.

1232
01:40:49,060 --> 01:40:51,270
-What are we waiting for?
-Let's go!

1233
01:40:53,320 --> 01:40:54,570
That's enough.

1234
01:40:55,570 --> 01:40:57,280
Just let him lay there.

1235
01:41:20,630 --> 01:41:21,890
What happened?

1236
01:41:25,470 --> 01:41:27,060
Jimmy, what happened?

1237
01:41:34,860 --> 01:41:36,400
Where are you going?

1238
01:41:36,650 --> 01:41:37,780
Let me by.

1239
01:41:53,250 --> 01:41:54,460
You want him?

1240
01:41:57,250 --> 01:41:58,670
You can have him!

1241
01:42:04,680 --> 01:42:06,470
The little rat's yours.

1242
01:42:18,530 --> 01:42:20,820
Get some fresh water!

1243
01:42:24,240 --> 01:42:25,410
Terry.

1244
01:42:27,660 --> 01:42:28,990
Who's in charge here?

1245
01:42:29,080 --> 01:42:31,370
Yours truly is in charge here.

1246
01:42:31,460 --> 01:42:34,460
We got to get this ship out of here.
It's costing us money.

1247
01:42:34,540 --> 01:42:35,790
Blow your whistle.

1248
01:42:35,880 --> 01:42:37,960
All right you guys, get to work!

1249
01:42:38,920 --> 01:42:39,960
Come on!

1250
01:42:40,590 --> 01:42:43,590
-What goes?
-I'll have them working in two minutes.

1251
01:42:44,010 --> 01:42:46,510
He better get these men to work.

1252
01:42:48,890 --> 01:42:51,480
Come on, you guys, on the double!
Get to work!

1253
01:42:51,560 --> 01:42:54,600
Come on. Get in there. Get in there.

1254
01:42:55,600 --> 01:42:58,610
-How about Terry?
-lf he don't work, we don't work.

1255
01:42:58,770 --> 01:43:00,900
Work! He can't even walk!

1256
01:43:01,440 --> 01:43:04,570
You want to know who works?
The ones I pick to work.

1257
01:43:04,660 --> 01:43:07,370
Now get going.
Come on all of you, get in there.

1258
01:43:09,490 --> 01:43:11,250
Come on, get out here.

1259
01:43:11,370 --> 01:43:13,660
Come on, Pop, on the double,
you work today.

1260
01:43:13,750 --> 01:43:16,250
All my life you pushed me around.

1261
01:43:16,420 --> 01:43:17,920
Come on.

1262
01:43:31,060 --> 01:43:32,980
Come on, you walk in with them.

1263
01:43:41,360 --> 01:43:45,570
If Terry walks in, we walk in with him.
They're waiting for him to walk in.

1264
01:43:55,960 --> 01:43:57,710
Did you hear that, Terry?

1265
01:43:59,040 --> 01:44:01,590
Terry, did you hear that?

1266
01:44:01,670 --> 01:44:02,710
Yeah.

1267
01:44:03,550 --> 01:44:07,720
You lost the battle,
but you have a chance to win the war.

1268
01:44:09,510 --> 01:44:11,430
-What do I have to do?
-Walk.

1269
01:44:11,930 --> 01:44:13,180
Can you walk?

1270
01:44:14,350 --> 01:44:15,850
-Walk.
-Yes, walk.

1271
01:44:17,900 --> 01:44:19,690
To the pier, I mean.

1272
01:44:19,770 --> 01:44:22,440
-We'll walk in with you.
-So the shippers can see...

1273
01:44:22,530 --> 01:44:25,110
...we'll take no more orders
from Johnny Friendly.

1274
01:44:25,190 --> 01:44:29,120
Then it'll give us back our union,
so we can run it on the up and up.

1275
01:44:29,660 --> 01:44:32,700
Johnny Friendly's laying odds
that you won't get up.

1276
01:44:36,160 --> 01:44:39,210
What are you standing around for?
Come on, help me!

1277
01:44:40,330 --> 01:44:41,750
Come on, you guys.

1278
01:44:43,500 --> 01:44:46,920
Put me on my feet. Come on.

1279
01:44:58,440 --> 01:44:59,690
How you doing?

1280
01:45:02,110 --> 01:45:03,770
Am I on my feet?

1281
01:45:05,190 --> 01:45:06,740
You're on your feet.

1282
01:45:09,320 --> 01:45:11,820
-I don't think I'm gonna make it.
-Terry!

1283
01:45:12,910 --> 01:45:13,950
You can.

1284
01:45:17,750 --> 01:45:21,000
Just finish what you started. You can.

1285
01:45:28,920 --> 01:45:30,300
Give me my hook.

1286
01:45:30,630 --> 01:45:33,010
Look, for God's sake,
what're you trying to do?

1287
01:45:33,100 --> 01:45:35,470
Take your hands off him. Keep going.

1288
01:45:40,600 --> 01:45:41,980
Leave him alone!

1289
01:46:44,880 --> 01:46:47,130
All right, let's go to work!

1290
01:47:00,140 --> 01:47:02,600
Where you guys going? Wait a minute.

1291
01:47:03,190 --> 01:47:06,770
I'll remember this.
I'll remember every one of you!

1292
01:47:08,270 --> 01:47:10,610
I'll be back! Don't you forget that!

1293
01:47:11,070 --> 01:47:12,610
I'll be back!
