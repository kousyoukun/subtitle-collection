1
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,997
Now you take it easy, slugger.

2
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,149
Joey!

3
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,113
Joe Doyle!

4
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,037
All right! What do you want?

5
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,593
I got one of your birds.

6
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,148
I recognised him by the band.

7
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:29,232
It must be Danny-boy.
I lost him in the last race.

8
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,478
He flew into my coop.

9
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:34,597
-You want him?
-I got to watch myself these days.

10
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,428
You know what I mean?

11
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,589
Don't worry.

12
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,514
-I'll take him up to your loft.
-Okay, I'll see you on the roof.

13
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,709
How goes?

14
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:08,994
He's up on the roof.

15
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,195
The pigeon?

16
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,354
Yeah, it worked.

17
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:19,390
I think somebody fell off the roof.

18
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:28,950
He thought he'd sing
to the Crime Commission. He won't.

19
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,758
I thought they'd talk to him.

20
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,034
That's the idea.

21
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:34,759
I thought they'd talk to him
and get him to dummy up.

22
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,478
Maybe he gave them an argument.

23
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:39,996
I figured the worst they was gonna do
was lean on him a little bit.

24
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,752
Maybe he gave them an argument.

25
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:45,196
He's been giving Johnny the Boss
a lot of arguments lately.

26
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,318
He wasn't a bad kid, that Joey.

27
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,515
A canary.

28
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:52,034
Maybe he could sing, but he couldn't fly.

29
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:00,270
Come on, I'll buy you a drink.

30
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,156
I'll be in there later and....

31
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,433
Father Barry is here.

32
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,515
Same thing happened to my Andy
five years ago.

33
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,750
-You're the boy's father?
-That's right.

34
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:27,479
Looks like he fell off the roof,
or maybe he was pushed.

35
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,675
-Any ideas?
-No.

36
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:32,548
He was the only longshoreman that had
the guts to talk to the crime investigators.

37
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,392
-Who asked you?
-Everybody knows that.

38
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,196
Shut up.

39
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:38,238
-lf he took my advice he wouldn't be--
-Everyone knows that.

40
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,309
I said, "Shut up!"

41
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:42,073
I know how you feel about cops,
but if you give me...

42
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,513
...some leads I could--

43
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,636
I kept telling him, "Don't say nothing.

44
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,631
"Keep quiet, you'll live longer."

45
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:52,674
I've been on the docks all my life,
boy, and there's one thing I learned.

46
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:55,877
You don't ask no questions,
you don't answer no questions...

47
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:58,349
...unless you want to wind up like that.

48
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,630
Edie, come here.

49
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,158
I want to talk to you.

50
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,870
Father, who'd want to kill Joey?

51
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:15,629
Stay away from him! Stay away from him!

52
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,473
Edie, listen!

53
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,596
Remember time and faith are great healers.

54
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,592
Father, my brother is dead
and you talk about time and faith.

55
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:26,070
My brother was the best kid in the
neighbourhood and everybody said so.

56
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,390
I'm in the church if you need me.

57
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,432
You're in the church if I need you?

58
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:34,239
Did you ever hear of a saint
hiding in a church?

59
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,995
I want to know who killed my brother!

60
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:41,110
What's the matter with you, punk?

61
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:50,394
Boss, Packy wants another drink
on the cuff.

62
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,393
Give it to him.

63
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,997
And here's the cut on the shape-up.

64
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:59,392
891 men, $3 a head. That's $2,673.

65
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,118
Charley, you count them.

66
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,277
The banana boat is 46 tomorrow.

67
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,636
If we pull a walkout,
it might be a few bucks from the shippers.

68
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,359
-Them bananas go bad in a hurry.
-Ask $2,000.

69
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,918
Clowns can't fight.

70
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,031
There's nobody tough anymore.

71
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,873
Hi, slugger.

72
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,069
Hi, kid.

73
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,834
Where's Morgan?
Where's that big banker of mine?

74
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,399
Right here, Mr. Friendly.

75
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:35,677
-Hi, JP, how's business?
-Having trouble with Kelly again, boss.

76
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:38,558
He won't take no loans
and Big Mac puts him to work anyway.

77
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:41,108
-He's my wife's nephew.
-He won't take no loans!

78
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,509
I got to put him to work.
She'd murder me!

79
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,556
That's why I never got married.

80
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:48,632
Here's the interest on the day, boss. $532.

81
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,469
You count it.

82
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,232
Counting makes me sleepy.

83
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,677
You handle that sheet metal all right?

84
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:57,513
It was easy. The new checker faked
the receipt. Here.

85
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:00,319
You want to talk to me,
take the cigar out of your mouth.

86
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,630
-Stow the receipt. I'll take the cash.
-Sure.

87
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:06,076
-Here you are, 45 bills.
-Terry, you count this.

88
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,717
Come on, go on, it's good for you.

89
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,552
-lt develops your mind.
-What mind?

90
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,278
Shut up. I like the kid.

91
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:17,477
Remember the night
he took Farella at St. Nick's, Charley?

92
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:20,757
We won a bundle. Real tough. A big try.

93
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,478
I lost the count.

94
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,716
Okay, forget it, Einstein.

95
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,117
How come you never got an education
like your brother Charley?

96
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:33,875
The only arithmetic he ever got
was hearing the referee count up to 10.

97
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:36,474
You're not too funny today, Fat Man.

98
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:41,150
Hey, what gives
with our boy tonight, Charley?

99
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,714
He isn't himself.

100
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,110
It's the Joey Doyle thing
and how he exaggerates the thing.

101
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:49,033
Too much Marquis of Queensbury
softens him up.

102
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:52,078
Listen, I'm a soft touch, too.
Ask any rummy on the dock...

103
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:55,596
...if I'm not good for a fin any time
they put the arm on me.

104
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:00,552
But my old lady raised us 10 kids
on a stinking watchman's pension.

105
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:04,988
When I was 16,
I had to beg for work in the hold.

106
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,589
I didn't work my way up
out of there for nothing.

107
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,432
I know that, Johnny, I know it.

108
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:12,715
Taking over this local took a little doing.

109
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:16,509
There were rough fellas in the way.
They gave me this to remember them by.

110
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:20,559
He kept his hand over his throat
to stay alive and he still went after them.

111
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,312
I know what's eating you.

112
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:28,559
I got 2,000 dues-paying members in
this local, that's $72,000 a year legitimate.

113
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,152
When each one of them puts in
a couple of bucks a day just to make sure...

114
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:35,834
...the work's steady, well, figure it out.

115
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:37,798
That's just for openers.

116
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:40,917
We've got the fattest piers
in the fattest harbour in the world.

117
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,150
Everything moves in and out,
we take our cut.

118
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:47,074
Why shouldn't we?
If we can get it, we're entitled to it.

119
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:50,995
You don't suppose I can afford to be
boxed out of a deal like this, do you?

120
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:55,119
A deal I sweated and bled for, on account
of one lousy little cheese-eater...

121
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:59,352
...that Doyle bum, who thinks he can
squeal to the crime commission. Do you?

122
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,189
Do you?

123
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,839
No, Johnny.
I just figured I should have been told.

124
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,558
I make it $2,623.

125
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,038
You're $50 short, Skins.

126
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:22,989
Gimme.

127
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:27,397
-I must've miscounted.
-Gimme!

128
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:38,872
You come from Green Point, go back there.
You don't work here no more.

129
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,914
Here, kid, here's half a bill.
Go get you a load on.

130
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,592
No, I'm okay, Johnny, thanks.

131
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,636
Present from your Uncle Johnny.

132
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:56,836
And Mac, tomorrow morning when you
shape the men, put Terry up in the loft.

133
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:59,275
Number one. Every day.

134
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:03,430
It's nice, easy work if you check in
and goof off on a coffee bag.

135
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,794
Okay?

136
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,432
You got a real friend here.

137
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,279
Now don't forget it.

138
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,878
Why should he forget it?

139
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,513
Thanks, Johnny.

140
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,478
All right, payday.

141
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,309
Rony.

142
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,469
Mac.

143
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,239
Hi, Terry.

144
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,389
-Hi, kid.
-I was just going to feed them.

145
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,879
I already fed them.

146
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,678
You must've been up early?

147
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:08,674
I was up anyhow,
so I figured I might as well.

148
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:13,033
They sure got it made.

149
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:17,955
Eating, sleeping, flying around like crazy,
raising gobs of squabs.

150
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,511
Well, I better get over there.

151
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:35,551
Be careful. Don't spill no water on the
floor. I don't want them to catch cold.

152
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:37,759
I'll see you around.

153
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:48,391
Come on, Tony, give me the tabs.

154
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,072
He was a good boy, that Doyle kid.

155
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,355
Sure he was,
that's why he got it in the head.

156
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:59,000
But he couldn't learn
to keep his mouth shut.

157
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:06,230
Hey, Pop, why don't you go home?

158
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,834
The boys at work today
will be chipping in gladly.

159
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,717
No thanks, fellas, I'm gonna shape.

160
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:15,430
-Who do you think'll pay for the funeral?
-Johnny Friendly, the "great labour leader."

161
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,673
Why don't you keep that big mouth
of yours shut?

162
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:20,432
What are you, a wise guy?

163
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:23,592
If I was wise, I wouldn't be
no longshoreman for 30 years.

164
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,796
I'm poorer now than when I started.

165
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,393
-Wise guy.
-Big mouth.

166
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,950
Don't mess with those guys.

167
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,876
I brought you Joey's windbreaker.
It might come in handy.

168
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:37,633
-Go ahead, wear it.
-Thanks, Pop.

169
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:40,632
Mine's more full of holes
than the Pittsburgh infield.

170
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:43,553
Hey, Joe, I got a coat for you.

171
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:56,952
Do you know Terry Malloy?

172
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:59,470
No, I don't. Never heard of him.

173
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,591
You're Terry Malloy, aren't you?

174
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:07,675
So what?

175
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:10,320
Didn't I see you fight
a couple of years ago?

176
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:13,431
Without the birdseed, what do you want?

177
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:15,192
Identification.

178
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:21,550
Waterfront Crime Commission.
What's that?

179
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:23,596
I just want to ask you a few questions.

180
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:26,240
We'll hold public hearings
on waterfront crime...

181
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,880
...and underworld infiltration
of longshore unions.

182
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:32,077
-I don't know nothing.
-You haven't heard the questions yet.

183
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,196
-What did you say?
-You heard me.

184
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:38,239
There's a rumour that you're one of
the last people to see Joey Doyle alive.

185
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,548
I don't know nothing.

186
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:41,870
Nobody's accusing you of anything,
Mr. Malloy.

187
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,393
I hope you understand that.

188
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:47,109
Just want to ask you some questions
about some people you may know.

189
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:51,276
-People I may know.
-That's right.

190
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:55,157
-You better get out of here, buster!
-Slow down, boy.

191
00:13:56,680 --> 00:14:00,036
I don't know nothing, I ain't seen nothing,
and I'm not saying nothing.

192
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:02,315
Why don't you and your girlfriend take off.

193
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,753
All right, Mr. Malloy!

194
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:06,798
You've every right not to talk
if that's what you choose to do.

195
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,269
-The public has a right to know the facts.
-Yeah.

196
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,793
We'll be seeing you again.

197
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:13,633
Never's going to be too much soon
for me, Shorty.

198
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,314
Take it easy.

199
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:20,119
How do you like them mutts
taking me for a pigeon.

200
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:22,635
-Who is it?
-I don't know who they are.

201
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:26,709
You're three weeks behind on the last $25,
but I'm willing to take a chance.

202
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:30,156
Some chance at ten percent a week
and if we don't borrow, we don't work.

203
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,878
May you rot in hell, JP.

204
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:35,153
When I'm dead and gone,
you'll know what a friend I was.

205
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:38,118
Why don't you drop dead now,
so we can test your theory?

206
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,633
Condolences.

207
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:42,039
Hey, Pop, look.

208
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:49,279
Let her go, Tony.

209
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,429
I guess I spoke out of turn last night.

210
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:14,393
You think I'm just a gravy-train rider
with a turned-around collar, don't you?

211
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,589
I see the sisters taught you not to lie.

212
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:27,757
All right. Loft gang: Malloy...

213
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:30,953
...Hendriks, Padowski...

214
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:33,551
...Westerfield, McGuier.

215
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:40,397
I've been thinking about your question,
and you're right, Edie.

216
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:43,959
This is my parish.

217
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:47,473
I don't know how much I can do,
but I'll never find out...

218
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:50,791
...unless I come down here
and take a good look for myself.

219
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:53,349
I need some extra banana carriers.

220
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,475
Bananas again.

221
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:58,348
I wonder when we'll get a boat from
lreland with good lrish whiskey on it.

222
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,635
Dugan, my boy, you're dreaming again.

223
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:04,995
All right. Kelly. Richie.

224
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,149
Yeah, you.

225
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:21,073
What's the matter?
Nobody want to work today?

226
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,839
Yeah, you.

227
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:34,600
Who do you see to get
a day's pay around here?

228
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,270
-Meatballs.
-Definitely.

229
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:58,468
Come here.

230
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:01,074
Hey, Terry, grab that one!

231
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,398
Give me that.

232
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:08,469
Get away!

233
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:11,479
-Give it to me!
-Why?

234
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,318
Give it to me!

235
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:15,712
What makes you so special?

236
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:18,558
Things are looking up on the dock.

237
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:21,154
Don't you recognise her?
That's Joey Doyle's sister.

238
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,559
Give me that.

239
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:28,078
-You're Joey Doyle's sister?
-Yes, I am.

240
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:33,068
You don't wanna go to work today anyhow.

241
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,990
It's been nice wrestling with you.

242
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,149
Edie!

243
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:44,474
Pop. Here's your tab, take it.

244
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,790
All right, give it to me. I can use it.

245
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:51,189
Now get back to the sisters
where you belong.

246
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:54,636
I'm surprised at you, Father,
if you don't mind my saying so.

247
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:58,156
Letting her see things ain't fit
for the eyes of a decent girl.

248
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:00,920
All right, that's all. Come back tomorrow.

249
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:07,952
What do you do now?

250
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,516
Like Big Mac said, come back tomorrow.

251
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:12,477
Tomorrow? No ship tomorrow.

252
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:15,950
I've been standing here for five
straight mornings and that bum there...

253
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:19,555
-Come on, get out of here!
-...Iooks right through you.

254
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:24,318
-I'm sorry, Father, I didn't mean it.
-What do you want to do?

255
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,437
Come on, let's go get a ball.

256
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:29,717
Wait a minute.
Is this all you do, just take it like this?

257
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,838
What about your unions?

258
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:39,558
No other union in the country'd
stand for a thing like that.

259
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:42,916
The waterfront is tougher, Father,
like it ain't part of America.

260
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,629
-Do you know how a trigger local works?
-No. How?

261
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:51,191
You get up in the meeting, you make a
motion, the lights go out, then you go out.

262
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:54,670
That's how it's been since Johnny
and his cowboys took over the local.

263
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:57,797
Name one place where it's safe
to talk without getting clobbered.

264
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,916
-The church.
-What?

265
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,038
The bottom of the church.

266
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:06,680
You know
what you're letting yourself in for?

267
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:10,312
You got a cigarette on you?

268
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,998
Right over there.

269
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,674
-You working hard?
-Yeah.

270
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:37,197
You wouldn't mind working once in a while
to justify this lofty position, would you?

271
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:41,194
I finished the work.
I counted all them bags.

272
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,077
We have an extra detail for you.

273
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:46,357
That's if you don't mind
being disturbed or anything.

274
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:52,592
The priest and this Doyle girl are getting
a meeting up together down at the church.

275
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:55,877
We want a rundown on the names
and the numbers of all the players.

276
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:58,918
Wait a minute. All right, you're nominated.

277
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:01,838
Why me, Charley?
I feel funny going down there.

278
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:04,237
I'd just be stooling for you.

279
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:07,869
Let me tell you what stooling is.
Stooling is when you rat on your friend...

280
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:10,110
...the guys you're with.
Johnny wants a favour.

281
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,270
Don't think about it. Do it.

282
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:16,351
Go on. Join the congregation.

283
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,640
I thought there would be
more of you here, but....

284
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:40,234
The Romans found out what a handful
could do if it's the right handful.

285
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:48,797
I'm just a potato-eater,
but isn't it simple as one, two, three?

286
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,757
One. The working conditions are bad.

287
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:53,274
Two. They're bad
because the mob does the hiring.

288
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:57,717
Three. The only way to break the mob is
to stop letting them get away with murder.

289
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:01,190
If one of you'll answer one question,
we'd have a very good start.

290
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:04,352
And that question is:
Who killed Joey Doyle?

291
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:15,758
Not one of you has a line
on who killed Joey Doyle?

292
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:22,591
I have a hunch all of you
could tell us something about it.

293
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,358
All right, then answer this one:

294
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:30,797
How can we call ourselves Christians and
protect these murderers with our silence?

295
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:39,314
Jimmy Collins, you were Joey's best friend.

296
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:42,075
How can you just sit there
and not say anything?

297
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:45,675
I'll always think of him as my best friend,
but what do you want me to--

298
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,318
Who asked him in here?

299
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,754
I'm trying to find out
what happened to Joey Doyle.

300
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:52,956
-Maybe you can be helpful.
-Helpful?

301
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:55,072
The brother of Charley the Gent?

302
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:57,435
They'll help us get to the bottom
of the river.

303
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,397
You better leave Charley out of this.

304
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:02,711
-You don't think he'd be helpful?
-Why don't you ask him yourself?

305
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:07,191
-Maybe I will one of these days.
-One of these days.

306
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,834
Now, listen, you know who the pistols are.

307
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:15,556
Are you going to keep still
until they cut you down one by one?

308
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,315
Are you?

309
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:21,631
Dugan! How about you? Are you?

310
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:24,314
One thing you have to understand,
Father, on the dock...

311
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,152
...we've always been D and D.

312
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,196
-D and D? What's that?
-Deaf and dumb.

313
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:30,999
No matter how much
we hate the torpedoes, we don't rat.

314
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:33,435
Rat? Now boys, get smart.

315
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:37,432
I know you're getting pushed around,
but there's one thing...

316
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:40,318
...we have in this country,
and that's ways of fighting back.

317
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,038
Getting the facts to the public.

318
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:44,998
Testifying for what is right against
what is wrong.

319
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:48,959
What's ratting to them is telling the truth
for you, can't you see that?

320
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,516
Can't you see that?

321
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,151
It seems to me we've gone just about
as far as we can at this time.

322
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,629
I think you'll agree with that, Father.

323
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:18,031
So, I'd like to close with a few words
from St. Matthew:

324
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:21,079
"Come unto me all you--"

325
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,955
What did I tell you
about sticking your neck out.

326
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:33,152
-This is a police problem, not ours.
-These people need help.

327
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:36,232
Okay. Only don't blame me when
they ship you off to Abyssinia.

328
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:37,309
I won't.

329
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:47,432
You better go home in pairs.
Twos is two, you know.

330
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:49,829
Come on.

331
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,709
Pop!

332
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:08,394
Edie!

333
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,799
What's happened to Pop?

334
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,838
He's all right.
He's an old man, they won't hurt him.

335
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,394
Get out, you!

336
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:39,393
Are you all right?

337
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:42,199
Yeah, considering they were using
my head for a baseball.

338
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:44,635
You still D and D?
Do you still call it ratting?

339
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,756
-Are you on the level?
-What do you think?

340
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:49,752
If I stick my neck out and it's chopped off,
is that the end?

341
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:52,354
-Or will you go all the way?
-Down the line.

342
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:55,671
They'll put muscle on you, too,
turned-around collar or not.

343
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:59,992
Wipe your face. Listen, you stand up
and I'll stand up with you.

344
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:01,957
-Right down the wire?
-So help me God.

345
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,633
I think we're okay.

346
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:09,790
Steel pipes and baseball bats.

347
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:12,036
They play pretty rough around here.

348
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:14,190
I can make it home now all right.

349
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:17,758
Which side are you with?

350
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,711
Me? I'm with me, Terry.

351
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:23,715
You got a dime for a cup of coffee?

352
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:25,518
Go on, beat it, will you?

353
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:27,597
A little dime you don't need?

354
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:32,116
I know you. You're Edie Doyle.

355
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:34,429
Come on. Beat it.

356
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:38,752
Your brother was a saint, the only one
who ever tried to get me compensation.

357
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:40,754
You remember, Terry.

358
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:42,512
You was there that night.

359
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:48,674
Here's some change.
Go have yourself a ball.

360
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:52,676
You don't buy me. You're still a bum.

361
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,594
So long, Edie.

362
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:57,198
Lord have mercy on Joey.

363
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,598
Who's calling me a bum?

364
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:04,913
Everybody loved Joey.

365
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:08,310
From little kids to the old rummies.

366
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,232
Did you know him very well?

367
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:15,358
You know, he got around.

368
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:18,992
What did that man mean just now?

369
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:22,709
Don't pay no attention to him.
He's drunk, he's falling down. Everything.

370
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:25,394
He's a juicehead
that hangs around the neighbourhood.

371
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:27,118
Don't pay no attention.

372
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:28,759
I better go now.

373
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:32,916
You don't have to be afraid of me.
I'm not going to bite you.

374
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:36,836
I guess they don't let you walk
with fellas where you've been?

375
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:38,717
You know how the sisters are.

376
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:39,755
Yeah.

377
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:43,799
-Are you training to be a nun?
-It's just a regular college.

378
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:47,710
It's run by the Sisters of St. Anne.

379
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:49,674
Where is that?

380
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:51,874
In Tarrytown.

381
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:55,315
-Where's that?
-ln the country.

382
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:58,877
I don't like the country.
The crickets make me nervous.

383
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:03,117
How often do you get in here?

384
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,954
I haven't been here since last Christmas.

385
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:10,748
We were going to have
a Thanksgiving party.

386
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,469
That's nice.

387
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:17,239
What do you do up there? Just study?

388
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:19,793
I want to be a teacher.

389
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:22,314
Teacher? That's very good.

390
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,598
Personally, I admire brains.

391
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:28,832
My brother Charley is a very brainy guy.
He had a couple of years of college.

392
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:33,359
It isn't just brains. It's how you use them.

393
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:35,670
Yeah, I get your thought.

394
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:38,269
You know, I've seen you
a lot of times before.

395
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:41,591
Do you remember parochial school
out on Puluski Street?

396
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:43,352
Seven, eight years ago?

397
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:45,829
-Your hair, you had your hair....
-Braids.

398
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:48,309
Looked like a hunk of rope.

399
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:52,109
You had wires on your teeth and glasses.
Everything.

400
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,678
You was really a mess.

401
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:57,950
I can get home all right now, thanks.

402
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:01,199
Don't get sore.
I was just kidding you a little bit.

403
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:04,795
I just mean to tell you that you're,
you grew up very nice.

404
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:07,269
Thanks.

405
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,356
You don't remember me, do you?

406
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:15,515
I remembered you
the first moment I saw you.

407
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:16,953
By the nose, huh?

408
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:23,353
Some people just got faces that
stick in your mind.

409
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:28,750
I remember you were in trouble
all the time.

410
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:30,114
Now you got me.

411
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:34,877
The way those sisters used to whack me,
I don't know what.

412
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:39,753
They thought they was going to beat
an education into me, but I foxed them.

413
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:44,114
Maybe they just didn't know how
to handle you.

414
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:46,432
How would you have done it?

415
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:50,714
With a little more patience and kindness.

416
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:54,355
That's what makes people
mean and difficult.

417
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:56,670
People don't care enough about them.

418
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,792
Are you kidding me?

419
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,792
I'd better get you home.

420
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:08,555
There's too many guys around here
with only one thing on their mind.

421
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:12,071
Am I going to see you again?

422
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,234
What for?

423
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:20,554
I don't know.

424
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:27,116
I really don't know.

425
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:33,874
Come on.

426
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:54,751
You're all packed. Here's your bus ticket
and you're on your way back to St. Anne's.

427
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,510
I'm not ready to go back yet, Pop.

428
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:01,232
Edie, for years your mom and me
put quarters in the cookie jar...

429
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:03,914
...to keep you up there with the sisters...

430
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:07,789
...and keep you from things like
I've just seen outside the window.

431
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:11,197
A daughter of mine walking arm in arm
with Terry Malloy.

432
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:13,840
-Do you know who Terry Malloy is?
-Who is he, Pop?

433
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:16,434
He's the kid brother of Charley the Gent...

434
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:20,639
...who is Johnny Friendly's right hand
and a butcher in a camel hair coat.

435
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:24,430
Are you trying to tell me Terry is, too?

436
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:26,158
He tries to act tough...

437
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:30,670
...but there's a look in his eye.

438
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,959
Yeah, a look in his eye.
Hold your hats, brothers, here we go again.

439
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:39,473
You think he's one of them cases
you're always dragging into the house...

440
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:40,959
...and feeling sorry for...

441
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:43,554
...Iike that litter of kittens you brought in.

442
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:48,510
The only one you wanted to keep
had six toes and was cockeyed to boot.

443
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:51,197
Look at him. The little bum.

444
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:53,750
He said he wants to see me again.

445
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,038
See this arm?

446
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:06,350
Two inches longer than the other.

447
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:13,035
That's from years of working and sweating,
lifting and swinging a hook.

448
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:19,551
Every time I heist a box or a coffee bag,
I says to myself...

449
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,470
...that is for Edie so she can be
a teacher or something decent.

450
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:29,111
I promised your mom, Edie.
Don't let her down.

451
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:35,510
I don't want you to think
I'm not grateful for everything you've done.

452
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:38,990
For giving me the education
and keeping me away from all this.

453
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:42,514
But I've seen things
that I know are so wrong.

454
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:46,957
How can I go back to school and keep
my mind on things that are just in books...

455
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:48,917
...that aren't people living?

456
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:51,519
I'm going to stay.

457
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:55,434
I'm going to keep on trying
to find out who is guilty for Joey.

458
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:43,589
Hi.

459
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:46,469
What are you doing up there on the roof?

460
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:49,913
Just looking.

461
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:53,912
Take a look at the champion flock
of the neighbourhood.

462
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:57,113
Fly pretty nice, huh?

463
00:32:58,680 --> 00:32:59,999
Golden Warriors?

464
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:04,630
Yeah. I founded the Golden Warriors.

465
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:07,788
Might say that I was
the original Golden Warrior.

466
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:11,997
This bum here is my shadow.

467
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:15,078
He thinks I'm a tough man
because I boxed pro a lot.

468
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:20,592
Joey used to raise pigeons.

469
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:25,312
Joey used to raise pigeons.

470
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:29,392
Yeah, he had a few birds.

471
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:34,231
I've been taking care of them.

472
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:37,957
I wouldn't have thought
you'd be so interested in pigeons.

473
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:41,599
I just go for it.

474
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,870
You know this city is full of hawks?

475
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:50,590
That's a fact.
They hang around on top of the big hotels.

476
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:55,870
They spot a pigeon in the park,
right down on them.

477
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:59,399
You got a second?

478
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:05,197
I want to show you something.

479
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:16,154
What do you think of that fellow?

480
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:18,068
She's a beauty.

481
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:20,151
She's a he. His name is Swifty.

482
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:23,518
Look what he went and did.

483
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:32,478
He's my lead bird. He's always on
top of the perch. If another bum tries...

484
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:36,030
...to come along and take his place,
he really lets him have it.

485
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:39,717
Even pigeons aren't peaceful.

486
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,912
There's one thing about them,
they're very faithful.

487
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:47,272
They get married just like people.

488
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:48,270
Better.

489
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:51,668
They stay that way until one of them dies.

490
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:54,468
That's nice.

491
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,278
Go ahead. Fix the roof.

492
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,638
You want that egg?

493
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:12,473
Thanks.

494
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:18,193
Do you like beer?

495
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,719
I don't know.

496
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:25,790
I bet you never had a glass of beer.

497
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:28,800
-Did you ever have a glass of beer?
-No.

498
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:34,797
You want to have one with me?

499
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:37,988
In a saloon?

500
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:42,957
I know a nice dump down here
that has a special entrance for ladies.

501
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:49,798
Come on, it won't hurt.

502
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:54,034
Come on.

503
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:58,514
Okay.

504
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,713
Hey, you, mac.

505
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:10,869
Two Glockenheimers and two for chasers.

506
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:14,509
-Did you see the fight last night?
-No.

507
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:18,032
A kid named Riley, both hands.
Like you used to do.

508
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:22,350
I hope he got better dice than me.

509
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:28,110
Were you really a prizefighter?

510
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:30,754
I used to be.

511
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:34,676
How did you get interested in that?

512
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:39,317
I don't know. I had to scrap all my life,
I might as well get paid for it.

513
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:43,034
When I was a kid
my old man got bumped off.

514
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:47,159
Never mind how.
Then they stuck Charley and me...

515
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:51,355
...in a dump they call a "children's home."

516
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:55,038
Boy, that was some home.

517
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:59,716
Anyhow, I ran away from there
and fought in the club smokers...

518
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:02,758
...and peddled papers and Johnny Friendly
bought a piece of me.

519
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:04,273
Bought a piece of you?

520
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:07,397
Yes. Then...

521
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:10,800
...I was going pretty good there for awhile.

522
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:12,473
And after that....

523
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:19,109
What do you really care, am I right?

524
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:24,514
Shouldn't everybody care about
everybody else?

525
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:29,471
Boy, what a fruitcake you are.

526
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:33,313
I mean, isn't everybody
a part of everybody else?

527
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:35,836
And you really believe that drool?

528
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,194
Yes, I do.

529
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:42,438
Here we are. One for the lady
and for the gent.

530
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:47,598
Here's to the first one,
I hope it ain't the last.

531
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:50,993
Go ahead.

532
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:58,671
No, not like that. One hum.

533
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:12,828
Do you want to hear my philosophy of life?

534
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:18,075
Do it to him before he does it to you.

535
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:20,751
I never met anyone like you.

536
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:27,190
There's not a spark of sentiment,
or romance...

537
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:29,316
...or human kindness in your whole body.

538
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:32,039
What good does it to you
besides get you in trouble?

539
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:35,829
And when things and people get in
your way, you just knock them aside...

540
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:37,911
...get rid of them. Is that your idea?

541
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,754
Don't look at me when you say that.
It wasn't my fault what happened to Joey.

542
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:43,558
Fixing him wasn't my idea.

543
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:46,079
Who said it was?

544
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:48,670
Everybody's putting the needle on me.

545
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:52,079
You and the mugs in the church
and Father Barry.

546
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:54,310
I didn't like the way he was looking at me.

547
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,550
He was looking at everybody
the same way.

548
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:57,675
Oh, yeah?

549
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:00,511
What's with this Father Barry?

550
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:02,876
-What's his racket?
-His racket?

551
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:04,439
Yeah, his racket.

552
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:06,795
-Everybody's got a racket.
-But he's a priest.

553
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:08,359
Are you kidding, so what?

554
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:12,115
-That don't make no difference.
-You don't believe anybody, do you?

555
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,116
Down here it's every man for himself.

556
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:18,510
It's keeping alive. It's standing
with the right people so you get...

557
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:20,989
...a little bit of change in your pocket.

558
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:23,674
-And if you don't?
-lf you don't? Right down.

559
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:27,232
It's living like an animal.

560
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:30,958
I'd rather live like an animal
than end up like....

561
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:32,075
Like Joey?

562
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:36,029
-Are you afraid to mention his name?
-No.

563
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:39,990
Why do you keep harping on that for?

564
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:44,551
Come on, drink up.
You got to get a little fun out of life.

565
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,916
Come on. I'll stick some music on.

566
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:55,353
What's the matter?

567
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:05,274
What's the matter with you?

568
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:10,556
Help me if you can for God's sake.

569
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:16,392
Edie, I'd like to help.

570
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:20,199
I'd like to help,
but there's nothing I can do.

571
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:23,359
All right.

572
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:27,872
I shouldn't have asked you.

573
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:32,036
Edie, come on. Have a little beer.

574
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:34,079
Come on.

575
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:37,514
I don't want it.

576
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:43,910
You just stay here and finish your drink.

577
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,356
Don't go. I've got my whole life to drink.

578
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:54,198
Are you sore at me?

579
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,274
What for?

580
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:07,354
I don't know, for not being no help to you.

581
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:14,075
You would if you could.

582
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:27,957
Here I come.

583
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:30,720
Pick a winner.

584
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:33,509
First I got to kiss the bride.

585
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:37,070
Go on, you've kissed her before!

586
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:48,032
You can get out that way.
You want me to take you?

587
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:57,478
-Come on. What's going on here?
-Give me a cigarette.

588
00:41:57,560 --> 00:41:59,676
You've got to stop smoking so much.

589
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:03,110
Come on, we'll get out through here.

590
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:05,959
What's the matter?

591
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:13,074
Come on.

592
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:14,718
That's a pretty tune.

593
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,878
Here's a stick of gum. It'll do you good.

594
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,275
-Thank you.
-Do you like that music?

595
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:34,832
If I had my tuxedo,
I'd ask you to dance, but....

596
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:38,111
Come on. You want to spin?

597
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:45,071
Come on, don't be afraid.

598
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:47,958
You dance divinely.

599
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:00,078
I think we're doing pretty good.

600
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:03,350
The sisters ought to see you now.

601
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:07,513
Wait a minute.

602
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:13,515
I feel like I'm just floating.

603
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:16,353
I'm just floating.

604
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:20,313
Just floating.

605
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:31,111
I been looking all over for you, Terry.
The boss wants you.

606
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:33,469
Right now?

607
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:36,474
Yeah, he just got a call
from "Mr. Upstairs."

608
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:39,674
Something's gone wrong. He's plenty hot.

609
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:41,912
I'm going to take her home first.

610
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,798
I wouldn't do that.
I'll see the little lady home.

611
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:48,115
Tell him I'll come over there
when I'm ready.

612
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:50,953
Hey, wait up!

613
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:54,154
Who was that?

614
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:58,278
I don't know. Some mug.

615
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:02,153
Who was he?

616
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:06,516
You got to quit trying to find out
about Joey. It ain't safe.

617
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:08,636
I'm telling you it ain't safe.

618
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:11,999
Mr. Malloy, I was hoping
I might find you here.

619
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:13,229
Excuse me, Miss.

620
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:16,039
You're being served with a subpoena,
Mr. Malloy.

621
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:17,915
What?

622
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:21,515
Be at the State House, Courtroom 9,
10:00 Friday morning.

623
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:24,474
I told you I don't know nothing about that.

624
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:26,357
You can bring a lawyer if you wish.

625
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:29,432
You're privileged under the constitution
to protect yourself...

626
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:32,876
...against questions which might
implicate you in any crimes.

627
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:36,031
You know what they're asking me to do?

628
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:38,998
All we want you to do, Mr. Malloy,
is tell the truth.

629
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:43,558
Goodnight, kid. Nice wedding.

630
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:49,752
What are you going to do?

631
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:54,390
I ain't going to eat cheese
for no cop and that's for sure.

632
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:02,072
It was Johnny Friendly
who had Joey killed, wasn't it?

633
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:05,232
He had him killed or
he had something to do with it, didn't he?

634
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:07,311
He and your big brother Charley?

635
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,992
You can't tell me, can you,
because you're a part of it.

636
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:14,715
Because you're just as bad as
the worst of them. Tell me the truth.

637
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:17,360
You better go back to that school
out in daisyland.

638
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:20,193
You're driving yourself nuts,
you're driving me nuts.

639
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:23,795
Quit worrying about the truth all the time.
Worry about yourself.

640
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:26,550
I should've known you wouldn't tell me.

641
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:30,315
Pop said Johnny Friendly used to own you.
I think he still owns you.

642
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:34,990
No wonder everybody calls you a bum.

643
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:40,194
Don't say that to me, Edie,
don't say that to me now.

644
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:44,034
No wonder.

645
00:45:44,120 --> 00:45:46,111
I'm only trying to help you out.

646
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:49,909
I'm trying to keep you from getting hurt.
What more do you want me to do?

647
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,797
-Much more.
-Wait a minute.

648
00:45:51,880 --> 00:45:53,438
Much, much, much more.

649
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:56,078
Where are you going?

650
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:27,352
Hi there, Johnny,
I was just coming over there.

651
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:32,155
-Where were you, in Chicago?
-No, I was just on my way over there.

652
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:35,475
How many times
you been knocked out, Terry?

653
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:37,312
Knocked out? Two times.

654
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:39,352
That's once too often.

655
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:43,069
Your brains must be rattling.
What you got up there, Chinese bells?

656
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:45,998
I thought you were gonna
keep an eye on that church meeting.

657
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:48,435
I was there. Nothing was happening.

658
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:51,512
Nothing happening!
Some operator you got yourself there.

659
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:54,194
One more like him,
we'd all be wearing striped pyjamas.

660
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:58,034
I'm telling you, Johnny, it was a
big nothing. The priest did all the talking.

661
00:46:58,120 --> 00:47:01,556
Half an hour later, a certain
Timothy J. Dugan had a secret session...

662
00:47:01,640 --> 00:47:05,155
...with the crime commission,
and he done all the talking.

663
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:07,992
Dugan, what does he know?

664
00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:10,828
Just 39 pages of our operation, that's all.

665
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:14,713
Where'd you get that?

666
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:17,872
-I got it.
-The complete works of Timothy J. Dugan.

667
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:23,511
I knew he had the guts, but I never--

668
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:26,797
Guts! Why, that crummy pigeon.
He ought to have his neck wrung!

669
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:30,316
That's what we get for mixing
with this punch-drunk brother of yours.

670
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:32,868
He was good for laughs,
but this is business.

671
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:35,315
I don't like anyone goofing off
in my business.

672
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:38,198
-I wasn't--
-Why are you going around with his sister?

673
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:39,599
Just shut up!

674
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:45,117
It's just the Doyle broad,
she's got him so he doesn't...

675
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:47,031
...know where his feet is anymore.

676
00:47:47,120 --> 00:47:48,951
It's an unhealthy relationship.

677
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:51,998
-Definitely!
-Get rid of her...

678
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:54,196
...unless you're both tired of living.

679
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:55,713
-You got her address?
-Yeah.

680
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:58,075
We've got to do something
to muzzle Dugan...

681
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:00,993
...or he'll raise the biggest stink
this town's ever seen.

682
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:03,116
We got the best muscle on the waterfront.

683
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:05,873
The time to use it is now.
Pronto, if not sooner.

684
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:09,748
You know where you're going? Back in
the hold. No more cushy job in the loft.

685
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:13,594
It's down in the hold with the sweat gang
till you learn your lesson.

686
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:19,708
Let's go.

687
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:21,319
Wise up!

688
00:48:59,640 --> 00:49:02,393
Come on, you're all right. Let's do it.

689
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:04,678
At last an lrish shipment.

690
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:08,469
And loaded to the gunnels
with fine lrish whiskey.

691
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:11,638
You see, Kayo,
the good Lord takes care of us all the time.

692
00:49:11,720 --> 00:49:14,234
-That he does.
-Come on out, Kayo, get it up.

693
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:16,595
All right, take it up. Take it away.

694
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,116
And don't go walking off with any of that!

695
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:23,873
You know how the boss feels
about individual pilferage.

696
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:25,439
All right, all right.

697
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:29,072
Now you see the advantage
of a little man in a big coat.

698
00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:38,118
-Let me see you a minute afterwards.
-What're you here for?

699
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:41,317
To see that we don't steal
any of Mr. Friendly's precious cargo?

700
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:44,039
-I want to talk to you.
-Get away from me, will you?

701
00:49:44,120 --> 00:49:46,395
All right. Take it up. Take it away.

702
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:01,870
Kayo, you're a walking distillery.

703
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:11,553
Watch it!

704
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:14,629
Get a doctor!

705
00:50:15,160 --> 00:50:17,674
He don't need a doctor. He needs a priest.

706
00:50:33,080 --> 00:50:35,196
I came down here to keep a promise.

707
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:38,514
I gave Kayo my word
that if he stood up to the Mob...

708
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:41,353
...I'd stand up with him all the way.

709
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:44,271
And now Kayo Dugan is dead.

710
00:50:44,920 --> 00:50:47,832
He was one of those fellows
who had the gift for standing up.

711
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:49,638
This time they fixed him.

712
00:50:49,720 --> 00:50:53,030
They fixed him for good this time,
unless it was an accident...

713
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:54,798
...Iike Big Mac says.

714
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:59,195
Some people think the Crucifixion
only took place on Calvary.

715
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:01,236
They better wise up.

716
00:51:01,720 --> 00:51:05,508
Taking Joey Doyle's life to stop him
from testifying is a crucifixion.

717
00:51:07,320 --> 00:51:09,390
Dropping a sling on Kayo Dugan...

718
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:12,278
...because he was ready
to spill his guts tomorrow...

719
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:14,476
...that's a crucifixion.

720
00:51:15,560 --> 00:51:18,393
Every time the mob
puts the crusher on a good man...

721
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:22,792
...tries to stop him from doing his duty
as a citizen, it's a crucifixion.

722
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:26,316
And anybody who sits around
and lets it happen...

723
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:30,359
...keeps silent about something he knows
has happened, shares the guilt of it...

724
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:32,396
...just as much as the Roman soldier...

725
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:35,870
...who pierced the flesh of Our Lord
to see if He was dead.

726
00:51:39,840 --> 00:51:42,035
Go back to your church, Father.

727
00:51:42,120 --> 00:51:43,838
Boys, this is my church.

728
00:51:44,920 --> 00:51:47,878
If you don't think Christ is down here
on the waterfront...

729
00:51:47,960 --> 00:51:50,076
...you've got another guess coming!

730
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:52,237
Get off this dock, Father!

731
00:51:53,080 --> 00:51:54,559
Tillio, don't do that.

732
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:57,313
-Whose side are you on, boy?
-Let him finish.

733
00:51:57,440 --> 00:51:58,873
Every morning...

734
00:52:01,120 --> 00:52:03,680
...when the hiring boss blows his whistle...

735
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:07,194
...Jesus stands alongside you
in the shape-up.

736
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:10,636
He sees why some of you get picked
and some of you get passed over.

737
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:13,553
He sees the family men worrying
about getting their rent...

738
00:52:13,640 --> 00:52:15,949
...and getting food for the wife and kids.

739
00:52:16,040 --> 00:52:19,191
He sees you selling your souls
to the mob for a day's pay.

740
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:22,714
The next bum that throws something
deals with me!

741
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:24,677
I don't care if he's twice my size!

742
00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:27,115
What does Christ think
of the easy-money boys...

743
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:29,589
...who do none of the work
and take all the gravy?

744
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:32,513
How does he feel about
the fellows who wear $150 suits...

745
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:36,673
...and diamond rings on your union dues
and your kickback money?

746
00:52:37,720 --> 00:52:41,793
And how does He, who spoke up
without fear against every evil...

747
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:44,358
...feel about your silence?

748
00:52:44,440 --> 00:52:46,078
Shut up about that!

749
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:47,713
Just watch this.

750
00:52:53,080 --> 00:52:54,229
You see that?

751
00:52:54,320 --> 00:52:56,788
You want to know what's wrong
with our waterfront?

752
00:52:56,880 --> 00:53:00,429
It's the love of a lousy buck.
It's making love of a buck, the cushy job...

753
00:53:00,520 --> 00:53:02,476
...more important than the love of man.

754
00:53:02,560 --> 00:53:05,870
It's forgetting that every fellow
down here is your brother in Christ.

755
00:53:05,960 --> 00:53:07,951
But remember, Christ is always with you.

756
00:53:08,040 --> 00:53:10,793
Christ's in the shape-up,
in the hatch, in the union hall.

757
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:14,509
He's kneeling right here beside Dugan
and He's saying with all of you:

758
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:19,158
"lf you do it to the least of mine,
you do it to me."

759
00:53:20,120 --> 00:53:22,111
What they did to Joey and to Dugan...

760
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:25,670
...they're doing to you and you.

761
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:27,869
All of you!

762
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:32,829
And only you, only you with God's help...

763
00:53:32,920 --> 00:53:35,593
...have the power
to knock them out for good.

764
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:44,198
Okay, Kayo.

765
00:53:58,720 --> 00:53:59,709
Amen.

766
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:07,719
All right. Come on. Let's go. Break it up.
Let's go to work.

767
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:26,469
Edie, here's Joey's jacket. I'm sure Kayo
would wish you to have it back.

768
00:55:41,320 --> 00:55:43,151
I brought you Joey's jacket.

769
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:45,478
Yours is coming apart.

770
00:55:51,320 --> 00:55:52,389
Pigeons.

771
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:55,879
They're nervous.

772
00:55:56,480 --> 00:55:58,710
There was a hawk around here before.

773
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:44,115
Father, I want to speak to you a minute.

774
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:47,718
Remember what you said about...

775
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:50,917
...Kayo Dugan and keeping
your mouth shut when you know the score.

776
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:52,877
I don't want to hear your confession.

777
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:56,270
I'll dig it out for myself
and use it where it'll do the most good.

778
00:56:56,360 --> 00:56:59,397
-Father Gregory will hear you.
-I don't want to talk....

779
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:13,752
Wait a second, wait a minute.

780
00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:16,115
I just want to talk to you one second.

781
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:19,032
You've got to listen to me.

782
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:22,278
I'm the one that set Joey Doyle up
for the knock off.

783
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:33,550
Come on, take a walk with me, kid,
and give it to me straight.

784
00:57:36,760 --> 00:57:39,228
There's nothing I haven't heard. Come on.

785
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:53,478
It started out as a favour.

786
00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:56,319
Favour, who am I kidding?
It's "do it or else."

787
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:58,960
Believe me when I tell you
I just thought they were...

788
00:57:59,080 --> 00:58:02,311
...going to lean on him a bit.
I never thought he'd get knocked off.

789
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:04,231
I tried to tell Edie the other night.

790
00:58:04,320 --> 00:58:06,311
I really tried to, I wanted to tell her.

791
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:09,358
She's the first nice thing
that's ever happened to me.

792
00:58:09,880 --> 00:58:11,632
What are you going to do about it?

793
00:58:11,720 --> 00:58:13,676
What do you mean? About telling her?

794
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:16,797
Yes, about telling her.
The commission. Your subpoena.

795
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:18,359
I know you got a subpoena.

796
00:58:18,440 --> 00:58:19,634
I don't know.

797
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:22,629
It's like carrying a monkey
around on your back.

798
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:24,790
It's a question of "who rides who."

799
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:28,194
If I spill, my life ain't worth a nickel.

800
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:31,040
And how much is your soul worth
if you don't?

801
00:58:31,880 --> 00:58:34,872
They're asking me to put the finger
on my own brother.

802
00:58:36,040 --> 00:58:39,191
Johnny Friendly used to take me
to ball games when I was a kid.

803
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:40,793
Don't break my heart.

804
00:58:41,240 --> 00:58:44,676
I wouldn't care if he gave you
a life pass to the polo grounds.

805
00:58:44,840 --> 00:58:47,638
So you've got a brother.
Let me tell you something...

806
00:58:47,720 --> 00:58:50,280
...you've got other brothers
getting the short hand...

807
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:53,875
...while Johnny is getting mustard
on his face at the polo grounds.

808
00:58:53,960 --> 00:58:54,836
Ball games.

809
00:58:54,920 --> 00:58:57,559
Listen, if I were you, I would walk right....

810
00:58:59,800 --> 00:59:00,869
Never mind.

811
00:59:01,520 --> 00:59:05,593
I'm not asking you to do anything,
your own conscience has to do the asking.

812
00:59:05,880 --> 00:59:06,995
Conscience.

813
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:11,554
-That stuff can drive you nuts.
-Good luck.

814
00:59:12,760 --> 00:59:14,671
Is that all you've got to say?

815
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:17,469
Come here.

816
00:59:21,080 --> 00:59:22,911
Edie called me this morning.

817
00:59:23,360 --> 00:59:25,351
She's coming here to talk to me.

818
00:59:27,560 --> 00:59:29,551
Come on, why don't you tell her?

819
00:59:31,800 --> 00:59:32,869
No curves.

820
00:59:36,760 --> 00:59:37,829
Okay.

821
00:59:40,200 --> 00:59:41,315
Thanks.

822
01:00:18,120 --> 01:00:20,156
-You?
-Honest to God, Edie....

823
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:32,630
Believe me, I swear to God, Edie....

824
01:01:24,280 --> 01:01:26,510
Terry, guess who's here?

825
01:01:26,600 --> 01:01:29,319
That joker
from the crime commissioner's office.

826
01:01:49,480 --> 01:01:51,869
Suppose I knew a guy
that knocked somebody off...

827
01:01:51,960 --> 01:01:53,791
...you think I ought to turn him in?

828
01:01:53,880 --> 01:01:56,155
You mean call a cop? Are you kidding?

829
01:01:56,240 --> 01:01:58,196
You don't think I ought to turn him in?

830
01:01:58,280 --> 01:02:00,191
You was a Golden Warrior once.

831
01:02:01,080 --> 01:02:02,274
That's right.

832
01:02:04,240 --> 01:02:05,753
You started the gang.

833
01:02:27,560 --> 01:02:28,993
You looking for me?

834
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:32,238
No, not exactly.
I was just resting my dogs a minute.

835
01:02:32,520 --> 01:02:36,798
On the next investigation we get, I hope
it's got buildings with elevators in them.

836
01:02:36,880 --> 01:02:39,440
So far this one's just been climbing stairs.

837
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:41,752
What do you climb them for?

838
01:02:41,880 --> 01:02:44,599
It's worth it if we can tell
the waterfront story...

839
01:02:44,680 --> 01:02:47,069
...the way the people
have a right to hear it.

840
01:02:47,160 --> 01:02:48,479
Don't you think?

841
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,753
Didn't I see you in the Garden
three or four years ago...

842
01:03:09,840 --> 01:03:11,751
...with a fellow named Wilson?

843
01:03:14,120 --> 01:03:16,588
I thought you were going
to take him that night.

844
01:03:16,680 --> 01:03:18,398
Man, he really dumped you.

845
01:03:20,040 --> 01:03:21,314
He dumped me?

846
01:03:24,640 --> 01:03:28,394
What would you say if I told you
I held that bum up for half a round?

847
01:03:29,120 --> 01:03:31,588
I could see he was hurt.

848
01:03:32,520 --> 01:03:35,830
What did you think I was doing
with them combinations, petting him?

849
01:03:35,920 --> 01:03:37,672
You just couldn't finish him off?

850
01:03:37,760 --> 01:03:39,478
Don't monkey around there.

851
01:03:40,360 --> 01:03:42,032
Why didn't you finish him off?

852
01:03:42,120 --> 01:03:45,795
-I was doing a favour for some pals.
-Favour?

853
01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:49,159
That's the way it was.

854
01:03:49,240 --> 01:03:50,798
That's the way it was.

855
01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:53,519
If I'd have put him down,
I'd have had a title shot.

856
01:03:53,600 --> 01:03:55,033
I was ready that night.

857
01:03:55,120 --> 01:03:57,873
You sure looked it.
That's when I figured it was all over.

858
01:03:57,960 --> 01:04:00,428
It was all over, except for the lousy bet!

859
01:04:00,600 --> 01:04:01,794
-My own.
-Yeah.

860
01:04:07,320 --> 01:04:09,197
I guess I'd better get going.

861
01:04:09,640 --> 01:04:11,278
Hit those stairs again.

862
01:04:13,680 --> 01:04:17,309
Was that a hook or an uppercut
you caught him with that first time?

863
01:04:18,360 --> 01:04:21,033
I didn't use no hooks.
I was strictly a short puncher.

864
01:04:21,120 --> 01:04:22,678
It looked like a hook to me.

865
01:04:22,760 --> 01:04:26,070
I had that bum all figured out.
He had a good left hand.

866
01:04:26,160 --> 01:04:29,152
I let him tag me
with the left hand for a couple of rounds...

867
01:04:29,240 --> 01:04:33,119
...so just when he starts, he thinks
he's getting cute, I step inside a jab...

868
01:04:33,200 --> 01:04:35,509
...with a left, with a right, with a left.

869
01:04:35,600 --> 01:04:38,990
I had him in my arms
and from there on in we were just dancing.

870
01:04:39,080 --> 01:04:40,479
And that's a fact!

871
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:44,589
When those guys want to win a bet,
there's nothing they won't stop at.

872
01:04:48,120 --> 01:04:49,599
I didn't hear them, boss...

873
01:04:49,680 --> 01:04:52,240
...but I seen them nose to nose,
like pair of lovers.

874
01:04:52,320 --> 01:04:53,958
The flatfoot was eating it up.

875
01:04:54,040 --> 01:04:56,998
So they've been seen together
and he smiled at her.

876
01:04:57,080 --> 01:04:58,957
That doesn't mean he's going to talk.

877
01:04:59,040 --> 01:05:02,032
There is no evidence
until he gives public testimony.

878
01:05:02,120 --> 01:05:04,350
Thanks for the legal advice, Charley.

879
01:05:04,800 --> 01:05:06,836
That's what we kept you around here for.

880
01:05:06,920 --> 01:05:09,195
How do we keep him
from giving this testimony?

881
01:05:09,280 --> 01:05:12,590
Ain't that what you call
"the main order of business"?

882
01:05:12,680 --> 01:05:13,999
He's a good kid.

883
01:05:14,200 --> 01:05:15,713
-You know that.
-He's a bum.

884
01:05:15,800 --> 01:05:18,917
After all the days I gave him in the loft,
he's got no gratitude.

885
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:20,035
Shut up!

886
01:05:21,240 --> 01:05:23,515
I'm conducting this investigation.

887
01:05:26,840 --> 01:05:29,229
This girl and the father,
they got their hooks...

888
01:05:29,320 --> 01:05:32,756
...in the kid so deep he doesn't
even know which end is up any more.

889
01:05:32,840 --> 01:05:35,115
I ain't interested in his mental condition.

890
01:05:35,200 --> 01:05:38,237
All I want to know is:
is he D and D or is he a canary?

891
01:05:40,840 --> 01:05:43,354
-I wish I knew.
-So do l, Charley.

892
01:05:44,360 --> 01:05:45,554
For your sake.

893
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:53,399
What do you want me to do?

894
01:05:53,480 --> 01:05:56,438
It's simple. Drive him out
to this place we've been using...

895
01:05:56,520 --> 01:06:00,399
...try to straighten him out on the way.
If you don't, give him to Gerry G.

896
01:06:00,480 --> 01:06:01,879
You can't do that.

897
01:06:02,640 --> 01:06:06,428
Maybe the boy is out of line,
but he's just a confused kid!

898
01:06:06,520 --> 01:06:07,953
Confused kid!

899
01:06:11,160 --> 01:06:13,913
First he crosses me in public
and gets away with it...

900
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:17,356
...then the next joker, pretty soon
I'm just another fellow around here!

901
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:19,396
Johnny, I can't do that.

902
01:06:24,240 --> 01:06:25,355
Then don't.

903
01:06:35,440 --> 01:06:38,193
-Who do you like in the third?
-It's got to be New Hope.

904
01:06:38,280 --> 01:06:39,395
Definitely.

905
01:06:43,360 --> 01:06:44,395
Johnny...

906
01:06:46,040 --> 01:06:47,632
...it's my kid brother.

907
01:06:47,720 --> 01:06:49,597
That's for you to figure out.

908
01:06:49,680 --> 01:06:52,194
You can have it your way
or you can have it his way...

909
01:06:52,280 --> 01:06:54,794
...but you can't have it both ways.
Am I right, Truck?

910
01:06:54,880 --> 01:06:55,995
Definitely.

911
01:06:57,760 --> 01:06:59,318
Okay, on your horse...

912
01:07:01,120 --> 01:07:02,439
...deep thinker.

913
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:33,830
Hi, Charley.

914
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:37,790
I'm glad you stopped by for me.
I've been wanting to talk to you.

915
01:07:37,880 --> 01:07:39,393
-Sure, kid.
-Where to?

916
01:07:39,480 --> 01:07:41,789
Go to River St. I'll tell you where to stop.

917
01:07:41,880 --> 01:07:43,791
I thought we was going to the Garden?

918
01:07:43,880 --> 01:07:46,394
We are, but I want to cover a bet
on the way over.

919
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:49,040
Besides, this'll give us a chance to talk.

920
01:07:49,640 --> 01:07:52,234
Nobody ever stopped you
from talking, Charley.

921
01:07:55,520 --> 01:07:57,988
The grapevine says that
you got a subpoena.

922
01:07:59,160 --> 01:08:01,310
The guys know you're not a cheese-eater.

923
01:08:01,400 --> 01:08:04,073
They think you shouldn't be
on the outside so much...

924
01:08:04,160 --> 01:08:07,835
...but a little on the inside.
I have a few things for you at the docks.

925
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:10,188
A steady job...

926
01:08:10,760 --> 01:08:13,399
...a couple extra potatoes, that's all I want.

927
01:08:13,960 --> 01:08:15,916
That's great when you're a kid, but...

928
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,560
...you're getting on,
you're pushing 30, slugger.

929
01:08:18,640 --> 01:08:21,712
You know it's time to think
about getting some ambition.

930
01:08:23,640 --> 01:08:26,791
I always figured I'd live
a little bit longer without it.

931
01:08:29,120 --> 01:08:30,394
Maybe.

932
01:08:36,760 --> 01:08:40,799
There's a boss loader slot that's
open on the new pier we're opening up.

933
01:08:41,920 --> 01:08:44,229
It pays six cents on every...

934
01:08:44,560 --> 01:08:47,996
...100 pounds that goes in
and every 100 pounds that goes out...

935
01:08:48,080 --> 01:08:49,991
...and you don't have to lift a finger.

936
01:08:50,080 --> 01:08:52,674
That's $200, $300, $400 a week.

937
01:08:52,880 --> 01:08:55,633
$400 a week just for the openers.

938
01:08:56,320 --> 01:08:58,709
I get all that dough for not doing nothing?

939
01:08:58,800 --> 01:09:01,553
You don't do anything
and you don't say anything.

940
01:09:02,360 --> 01:09:03,588
You understand?

941
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:11,560
There's more to this
than I thought, Charley.

942
01:09:12,760 --> 01:09:14,876
I'm telling you there's a lot more.

943
01:09:15,920 --> 01:09:19,435
You're not thinking of testifying against
some people that we might know?

944
01:09:19,520 --> 01:09:21,078
I don't know, Charley.

945
01:09:21,760 --> 01:09:23,910
That's what I want to talk to you about.

946
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:27,788
Do you know how much the piers are
worth that we control through the local?

947
01:09:27,880 --> 01:09:30,792
Do you think Johnny's going to jeopardise
the whole set-up...

948
01:09:30,880 --> 01:09:34,873
...for one rubber-lipped, ex-tanker
who's walking on his heels? What the....

949
01:09:34,960 --> 01:09:36,871
I could've been a lot better.

950
01:09:36,960 --> 01:09:38,996
The point is we don't have much time!

951
01:09:39,080 --> 01:09:41,514
I'm telling you,
I haven't made up my mind yet!

952
01:09:41,600 --> 01:09:44,512
Make up your mind
before we get to 437 River St!

953
01:09:52,400 --> 01:09:54,391
Before we get to where, Charley?

954
01:09:59,640 --> 01:10:03,030
Listen, Terry.
Take the job, no questions. Take it!

955
01:10:05,680 --> 01:10:07,716
Terry, take this job, please.

956
01:10:37,840 --> 01:10:39,034
Look, kid....

957
01:10:43,080 --> 01:10:44,991
How much do you weigh, slugger?

958
01:10:46,920 --> 01:10:49,514
When you weighed 168 pounds...

959
01:10:50,800 --> 01:10:52,358
...you were beautiful.

960
01:10:54,400 --> 01:10:56,709
You could have been another Billy Conn.

961
01:10:58,880 --> 01:11:01,030
That skunk we got you for a manager...

962
01:11:02,200 --> 01:11:04,111
...he brought you along too fast.

963
01:11:06,160 --> 01:11:08,594
It wasn't him, Charley. It was you.

964
01:11:08,720 --> 01:11:10,438
Remember that night in the Garden?

965
01:11:10,520 --> 01:11:14,274
You came down to my dressing room
and said, "Kid, this ain't your night.

966
01:11:14,360 --> 01:11:16,510
"We're going for the price on Wilson."

967
01:11:17,320 --> 01:11:18,719
You remember that?

968
01:11:19,760 --> 01:11:21,318
"This ain't your night."

969
01:11:22,160 --> 01:11:24,958
My night! I could have taken Wilson apart!

970
01:11:26,280 --> 01:11:29,477
So what happens, he gets the title shot
outdoors in the ball park...

971
01:11:29,560 --> 01:11:32,597
...and what do I get?
A one-way ticket to Palookaville!

972
01:11:32,680 --> 01:11:34,352
You was my brother, Charley.

973
01:11:34,440 --> 01:11:36,908
You should have looked out
for me a little bit.

974
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:39,719
You should've taken care of me
a little so I wouldn't...

975
01:11:39,800 --> 01:11:42,109
...have to take dives for short-end money.

976
01:11:42,200 --> 01:11:44,589
I had some bets down for you.
You saw some money.

977
01:11:44,680 --> 01:11:47,319
You don't understand,
I could have had class!

978
01:11:47,400 --> 01:11:49,311
I could have been a contender.

979
01:11:49,520 --> 01:11:51,272
I could have been somebody.

980
01:11:52,360 --> 01:11:53,793
Instead of a bum...

981
01:11:54,320 --> 01:11:56,595
...which is what I am. Let's face it.

982
01:12:01,560 --> 01:12:03,039
It was you, Charley!

983
01:12:10,200 --> 01:12:11,189
Okay.

984
01:12:15,160 --> 01:12:16,513
I'll tell them...

985
01:12:17,760 --> 01:12:19,512
...I couldn't find you.

986
01:12:19,600 --> 01:12:21,670
Ten to one they won't believe me.

987
01:12:27,720 --> 01:12:29,153
Here, you take this.

988
01:12:30,800 --> 01:12:32,438
You're going to need it.

989
01:12:34,320 --> 01:12:35,548
You, pull over.

990
01:12:45,520 --> 01:12:47,078
Take me to the Garden.

991
01:13:25,120 --> 01:13:26,792
Stay away from me!

992
01:13:32,240 --> 01:13:33,070
Edie?

993
01:13:35,080 --> 01:13:37,310
Come on, open the door, please!

994
01:13:37,400 --> 01:13:38,389
Stop it!

995
01:13:41,960 --> 01:13:43,598
I want you to stay away from me.

996
01:13:43,680 --> 01:13:46,752
I know what you want me to do
but I ain't doing it, so forget it.

997
01:13:46,840 --> 01:13:48,831
I don't want you to do anything.

998
01:13:48,960 --> 01:13:51,235
You let your conscience
tell you what to do.

999
01:13:51,320 --> 01:13:54,198
Shut up about that conscience,
that's all I've been hearing!

1000
01:13:54,280 --> 01:13:57,556
I never mentioned the word before.
You just stay away from me!

1001
01:13:57,640 --> 01:13:59,312
Edie, you love me.

1002
01:14:00,280 --> 01:14:03,909
I didn't say I didn't love you,
I said stay away from me!

1003
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,719
-I want you to stay with me.
-Stay away from me!

1004
01:14:39,560 --> 01:14:40,913
Terry!

1005
01:14:42,520 --> 01:14:47,036
Terry, your brother's down here!
He wants to see you!

1006
01:14:49,360 --> 01:14:50,349
Charley?

1007
01:15:00,280 --> 01:15:01,998
Your brother's down here.

1008
01:15:03,040 --> 01:15:04,473
Come on down here.

1009
01:15:04,720 --> 01:15:06,199
He wants to see you.

1010
01:15:10,520 --> 01:15:11,839
Come on down!

1011
01:15:13,360 --> 01:15:16,033
-What is it Terry?
-Charley, he's in trouble.

1012
01:15:16,200 --> 01:15:17,315
Be careful.

1013
01:15:24,760 --> 01:15:25,749
Charley!

1014
01:15:26,400 --> 01:15:27,469
Terry?

1015
01:15:28,400 --> 01:15:32,678
Terry! Your brother's down here!

1016
01:15:34,960 --> 01:15:36,678
Do you hear what I hear?

1017
01:15:38,520 --> 01:15:39,509
Terry!

1018
01:15:53,200 --> 01:15:56,431
That's the same way they called Andy,
the night I lost him.

1019
01:15:56,960 --> 01:15:59,520
Edie, be careful! Edie, be careful!

1020
01:17:50,440 --> 01:17:51,793
They got Charley.

1021
01:17:52,240 --> 01:17:54,913
Terry, I'm frightened.
Let's get out of here, please.

1022
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:57,878
First Joey, then Dugan,
and now Charley, and next....

1023
01:17:58,200 --> 01:18:00,760
Please, Terry,
some place where we can live in peace.

1024
01:18:00,840 --> 01:18:03,638
I'm going to take it out of their skulls.

1025
01:18:07,360 --> 01:18:08,429
Charley...

1026
01:18:11,360 --> 01:18:13,920
...I'm going to take it out of their skulls.

1027
01:18:14,120 --> 01:18:16,031
Terry, they'll kill you, too.

1028
01:18:16,600 --> 01:18:19,512
Go get the father.
Tell him to take care of Charley.

1029
01:18:20,280 --> 01:18:23,238
And then come back here
and stay with him till he gets here.

1030
01:18:23,320 --> 01:18:25,993
Terry, please don't do anything, please!

1031
01:18:27,880 --> 01:18:30,599
For God's sake,
don't leave him alone here long!

1032
01:18:32,640 --> 01:18:34,756
-Please, Terry.
-Do what I tell you.

1033
01:18:58,840 --> 01:19:01,308
-Where's John Friendly?
-He's not here now.

1034
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:39,228
Give me a shot.

1035
01:19:39,960 --> 01:19:41,029
Take it easy.

1036
01:19:41,120 --> 01:19:43,554
Don't give me no advice, give me the shot.

1037
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:51,468
Why don't you go home
before Big John gets here?

1038
01:19:51,560 --> 01:19:53,232
Just give me a whiskey.

1039
01:19:59,760 --> 01:20:01,557
Stick around, Tillio.

1040
01:20:07,200 --> 01:20:08,519
There, sit down.

1041
01:20:19,440 --> 01:20:21,271
Get out of that phone booth!

1042
01:20:42,720 --> 01:20:44,551
Stay where you are!

1043
01:20:51,600 --> 01:20:53,272
I want to see you, Terry.

1044
01:20:53,480 --> 01:20:55,198
I'm right in front of you.

1045
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:01,070
Don't give me a hard time, Terry.

1046
01:21:05,880 --> 01:21:07,233
What do you want?

1047
01:21:09,920 --> 01:21:10,989
Your gun.

1048
01:21:11,120 --> 01:21:12,678
Go and chase yourself.

1049
01:21:12,760 --> 01:21:13,795
Give me the gun.

1050
01:21:13,880 --> 01:21:15,074
You go to hell.

1051
01:21:17,040 --> 01:21:18,951
-What did you say?
-Go to hell.

1052
01:21:23,880 --> 01:21:26,758
-Sorry, let me help you up.
-Get your hands off me!

1053
01:21:26,880 --> 01:21:28,677
Now what am I going to do?

1054
01:21:28,760 --> 01:21:31,558
You want to be a brave man
by firing lead into another man?

1055
01:21:31,640 --> 01:21:33,995
-It's none of your business!
-That's being brave!

1056
01:21:34,080 --> 01:21:35,479
Mind your own business!

1057
01:21:35,560 --> 01:21:37,551
Shooting a man isn't being brave!

1058
01:21:37,640 --> 01:21:39,119
It's none of your business!

1059
01:21:39,200 --> 01:21:41,350
Do you want to hurt Johnny Friendly?

1060
01:21:42,720 --> 01:21:44,358
Do you want to fix him?

1061
01:21:44,840 --> 01:21:47,400
-Do you really want to finish him?
-What do you think?

1062
01:21:47,480 --> 01:21:49,869
For what he did to Charley
and a dozen other men?

1063
01:21:49,960 --> 01:21:53,873
Don't fight him like a hoodlum down here
in the jungle. That's what he wants.

1064
01:21:53,960 --> 01:21:56,713
He'll hit you in the head
and plead self-defence.

1065
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:59,958
You'll fight him in the courtroom
tomorrow with the truth.

1066
01:22:00,040 --> 01:22:01,553
As you know the truth.

1067
01:22:09,800 --> 01:22:11,597
Now you get rid of that gun.

1068
01:22:11,680 --> 01:22:15,070
Unless you haven't the guts,
and if you haven't, hold onto it!

1069
01:22:19,840 --> 01:22:21,068
Give me a beer.

1070
01:22:30,600 --> 01:22:32,636
Do you want a beer? Make it two.

1071
01:23:10,960 --> 01:23:13,952
You mean to sit there and tell me
that your local takes in...

1072
01:23:14,040 --> 01:23:16,998
...$65,500 every year...

1073
01:23:17,520 --> 01:23:19,476
...and keeps no financial records?

1074
01:23:19,560 --> 01:23:21,232
Sure. We got records.

1075
01:23:21,320 --> 01:23:22,548
Where are they?

1076
01:23:22,840 --> 01:23:25,798
We was robbed last night,
and we can't find no books.

1077
01:23:26,800 --> 01:23:28,870
-You know you're under oath?
-Sure.

1078
01:23:37,480 --> 01:23:40,392
Isn't it odd to you that
five different waterfront locals...

1079
01:23:40,480 --> 01:23:42,391
...were broken into last night?

1080
01:23:42,480 --> 01:23:46,234
And the only item missing from all
of them was the financial records?

1081
01:23:46,320 --> 01:23:49,312
What do you mean, odd?
Like I told you, we was robbed.

1082
01:23:55,280 --> 01:23:56,793
That's all for now.

1083
01:24:01,600 --> 01:24:03,158
Call the next witness.

1084
01:24:04,880 --> 01:24:06,632
Before you call the next witness...

1085
01:24:06,720 --> 01:24:10,190
...are all the officers of Local 374
present this morning?

1086
01:24:12,080 --> 01:24:15,231
Will the following please rise
as their names are called?

1087
01:24:15,600 --> 01:24:19,070
Mr. Michael J. Skelly,
also known as Johnny Friendly, President.

1088
01:24:21,200 --> 01:24:23,430
Mr. Lewis O. Janotta, Vice President.

1089
01:24:24,760 --> 01:24:27,911
Mr. Daniel D. Coogan, Financial Secretary.

1090
01:24:28,640 --> 01:24:30,710
Mr. Mladen Sokolivitch, Delegate.

1091
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:33,150
Mr. Tillio A. Rodelli, Delegate.

1092
01:24:33,240 --> 01:24:34,992
Recording Secretary.

1093
01:24:39,640 --> 01:24:40,709
Thank you, gentlemen.

1094
01:24:40,800 --> 01:24:42,711
-Next witness.
-Mr. Malloy.

1095
01:24:54,200 --> 01:24:55,553
Raise your right hand.

1096
01:24:55,640 --> 01:24:57,915
-Name, please.
-Terry Malloy.

1097
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,753
Swear to tell the truth, the whole truth,
and only the truth?

1098
01:25:00,840 --> 01:25:01,636
-Right.
-I do.

1099
01:25:02,120 --> 01:25:03,473
-I do.
-Be seated, please.

1100
01:25:05,200 --> 01:25:06,519
Mr. Malloy...

1101
01:25:07,080 --> 01:25:09,992
...is it true that the night Joey Doyle
was found dead...

1102
01:25:10,080 --> 01:25:13,516
...you were the last one to see him
before he was pushed from the roof?

1103
01:25:13,600 --> 01:25:14,635
Yes.

1104
01:25:14,720 --> 01:25:16,551
Is it true you went immediately--

1105
01:25:16,640 --> 01:25:18,915
Wait! Except for the guys
that pushed him off.

1106
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:21,639
Is it true you went
immediately to the Friendly bar...

1107
01:25:21,720 --> 01:25:25,269
...and expressed your feelings
about the murder to Mr. Johnny Friendly?

1108
01:25:25,360 --> 01:25:26,679
John Friendly, right.

1109
01:25:26,760 --> 01:25:27,954
Mr. Malloy...

1110
01:25:28,400 --> 01:25:31,870
...can you tell me whether
Mr. Friendly, or I should say, Mr. Skelly...

1111
01:25:31,960 --> 01:25:35,953
...said anything to you to indicate his
responsibility in geing rid of Joey Doyle?

1112
01:25:36,040 --> 01:25:36,790
Right.

1113
01:25:36,880 --> 01:25:39,952
Would you say
that Mr. Friendly made it clear to you...

1114
01:25:40,080 --> 01:25:43,072
...it was absolutely necessary
he murder Joey Doyle in order...

1115
01:25:43,160 --> 01:25:44,832
...to maintain his control...

1116
01:25:44,920 --> 01:25:48,117
...on the docks of the waterfront locals!
Is that correct?

1117
01:25:48,200 --> 01:25:49,838
Will there be anything else?

1118
01:25:49,920 --> 01:25:52,639
Yes, Sidney, if Mr. Friendly calls, I'm out.

1119
01:25:53,320 --> 01:25:55,788
-Anytime today?
-lf he calls ever, I'm out!

1120
01:25:55,960 --> 01:25:57,029
Very well.

1121
01:25:57,960 --> 01:25:59,598
Thank you, Mr. Malloy.

1122
01:26:00,280 --> 01:26:02,999
You've done more
than break the Joey Doyle case.

1123
01:26:04,720 --> 01:26:07,917
We've begun to make it possible
for honest men to work the docks...

1124
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:10,309
...with job security and peace of mind.

1125
01:26:12,280 --> 01:26:14,589
You may step down. That's all for now.

1126
01:26:16,080 --> 01:26:17,991
Mr. Michael J. Skelly, please.

1127
01:26:28,800 --> 01:26:30,995
You just dug your own grave. Go fall in it.

1128
01:26:31,080 --> 01:26:33,640
You're dead on this waterfront
and every waterfront...

1129
01:26:33,720 --> 01:26:35,358
...from Boston to New Orleans.

1130
01:26:35,440 --> 01:26:37,317
You don't drive a truck or a cab...

1131
01:26:37,400 --> 01:26:41,188
...you don't push a baggage rack
you don't work no place, you're dead!

1132
01:26:58,360 --> 01:27:01,511
Will you quit following me?
Why don't you get off my tail?

1133
01:27:01,600 --> 01:27:04,592
Orders. You're hot.
You ought to be glad we're following you.

1134
01:27:04,680 --> 01:27:06,238
You're making me feel like a canary.

1135
01:27:06,320 --> 01:27:07,594
-Well....
-Lay off.

1136
01:27:10,960 --> 01:27:12,279
Hi, Cheeky.

1137
01:27:14,600 --> 01:27:16,272
Who's your friend?

1138
01:27:48,200 --> 01:27:51,192
I made some hot coffee.
I thought you might want some.

1139
01:27:55,360 --> 01:27:57,032
Anyway, it's all over.

1140
01:27:58,640 --> 01:28:00,790
My friends don't want to talk to me.

1141
01:28:00,960 --> 01:28:03,030
Are you sure they're your friends?

1142
01:28:10,720 --> 01:28:12,153
I'll see you later.

1143
01:28:27,640 --> 01:28:29,437
Hey, champ, how's the kid.

1144
01:28:33,320 --> 01:28:34,719
What's with him?

1145
01:28:49,240 --> 01:28:51,231
A pigeon for a pigeon!

1146
01:29:20,280 --> 01:29:21,269
Terry.

1147
01:29:36,920 --> 01:29:37,875
The kid.

1148
01:29:41,120 --> 01:29:42,109
Tommy?

1149
01:29:44,800 --> 01:29:46,791
What did he have to do that for?

1150
01:29:48,600 --> 01:29:49,999
Every one of them.

1151
01:29:51,400 --> 01:29:54,995
Terry, there's no place that's safe
for you now on the waterfront.

1152
01:29:55,760 --> 01:29:56,988
Maybe inland...

1153
01:29:57,400 --> 01:29:59,072
...out west some place...

1154
01:29:59,160 --> 01:30:00,229
...a farm.

1155
01:30:01,440 --> 01:30:02,429
A farm?

1156
01:30:02,920 --> 01:30:07,038
You could do anything, as long as
you're away from Johnny Friendly.

1157
01:30:07,120 --> 01:30:09,315
You tried to help the longshoremen...

1158
01:30:09,400 --> 01:30:12,676
...and they just turn their backs
and stick to their stupid D and D!

1159
01:30:12,760 --> 01:30:15,832
Are they taking chances for you?
Why should you?

1160
01:30:16,120 --> 01:30:18,554
You're not even listening to me, are you?

1161
01:30:26,280 --> 01:30:27,918
You're going down there.

1162
01:30:28,720 --> 01:30:32,315
Just because Johnny Friendly warned you
not to, you're going down there.

1163
01:30:32,400 --> 01:30:35,949
You think you got to prove
that you're not afraid of them!

1164
01:30:36,040 --> 01:30:37,951
Well, go ahead, get it over with.

1165
01:30:38,040 --> 01:30:41,077
Go down and get yourself killed
you stupid, pigheaded....

1166
01:30:41,160 --> 01:30:43,151
What are you trying to prove?

1167
01:30:46,280 --> 01:30:48,157
They always said I was a bum.

1168
01:30:49,960 --> 01:30:51,678
Well, I ain't a bum, Edie.

1169
01:30:53,040 --> 01:30:55,508
Don't worry, I'm not going to hurt nobody.

1170
01:30:56,040 --> 01:30:58,110
I'm just going to go down there...

1171
01:30:58,520 --> 01:31:00,033
...and get my rights.

1172
01:31:44,920 --> 01:31:46,911
Everybody works today!

1173
01:32:05,120 --> 01:32:06,109
Wolfgang.

1174
01:32:07,280 --> 01:32:08,349
Hendricks.

1175
01:32:09,160 --> 01:32:10,309
Padowski.

1176
01:32:11,640 --> 01:32:12,629
Martin.

1177
01:32:13,520 --> 01:32:14,509
Dalton.

1178
01:32:14,760 --> 01:32:15,749
Wurthy.

1179
01:32:16,440 --> 01:32:17,475
Hauffman.

1180
01:32:19,840 --> 01:32:23,310
-What do you think?
-That ain't such a bad picture of you, boss.

1181
01:32:23,440 --> 01:32:25,670
Stop breathing that clam sauce on me.

1182
01:32:26,840 --> 01:32:29,479
I wish you'd let me
go to work on that cheese-eater.

1183
01:32:29,560 --> 01:32:31,232
I'd top the bum off lovely.

1184
01:32:31,320 --> 01:32:33,436
Wait'll we get off this front page.

1185
01:32:33,520 --> 01:32:34,748
Then he's mine.

1186
01:32:35,520 --> 01:32:36,635
I want him.

1187
01:32:37,680 --> 01:32:39,398
You hear that? He's mine.

1188
01:32:45,200 --> 01:32:48,670
Where are them cops of yours, stoolie?
You're going to need them.

1189
01:32:54,120 --> 01:32:56,350
You're still short in the hatch, Mac.

1190
01:32:58,080 --> 01:33:00,674
Spec. Bring me the first man you see.

1191
01:33:02,360 --> 01:33:03,349
You.

1192
01:33:07,520 --> 01:33:09,590
Here's your man.

1193
01:33:12,360 --> 01:33:14,954
You want more of the same?
Come back tomorrow.

1194
01:33:18,320 --> 01:33:19,719
All right, that's it.

1195
01:33:41,240 --> 01:33:45,472
I hope that bum comes down here.
I'd love if he comes down here.

1196
01:33:46,280 --> 01:33:48,271
Did you ever hear of the Sullivan Law?

1197
01:33:48,360 --> 01:33:51,591
They'll be down on us for
the slightest infraction now, anything.

1198
01:33:51,680 --> 01:33:53,511
I'm going to be indicted any minute!

1199
01:33:53,600 --> 01:33:55,716
Come on, gimme.

1200
01:33:57,680 --> 01:33:59,671
Will you get it through your heads...

1201
01:33:59,760 --> 01:34:02,274
...they're dusting off the hot seat for me!

1202
01:34:04,840 --> 01:34:06,876
We're a law-abiding union.

1203
01:34:07,320 --> 01:34:08,435
Understand?

1204
01:34:43,880 --> 01:34:45,313
Friendly!

1205
01:34:46,600 --> 01:34:48,670
John Friendly, come out of there!

1206
01:34:55,120 --> 01:34:57,111
You want to know the trouble with you?

1207
01:34:57,200 --> 01:35:00,351
You think it makes you a big man
if you give the answers.

1208
01:35:00,440 --> 01:35:03,273
At the right time I'll catch up with you.
Think about that.

1209
01:35:03,360 --> 01:35:06,352
-Now, go on, beat it. Don't push your luck.
-Wait a minute.

1210
01:35:06,440 --> 01:35:09,955
You take them heaters away from you
and you're nothing, you know that?

1211
01:35:10,040 --> 01:35:11,871
You'll talk yourself in the river!

1212
01:35:11,960 --> 01:35:14,679
You take the good goods away
and the kickbacks...

1213
01:35:14,760 --> 01:35:17,991
...and shakedown cabbage
and the pistoleros and you're nothing!

1214
01:35:18,080 --> 01:35:21,152
Your guts is all in your wallet
and your trigger finger!

1215
01:35:21,360 --> 01:35:22,998
You ratted on us, Terry!

1216
01:35:23,200 --> 01:35:26,317
From where you stand, maybe.
But I'm standing over here now!

1217
01:35:26,400 --> 01:35:29,790
I was ratting on myself all them years,
I didn't even know it.

1218
01:35:29,960 --> 01:35:32,155
You gave it to Joey, you gave it to Dugan...

1219
01:35:32,240 --> 01:35:34,913
...and you gave it to Charley
who was one of your own.

1220
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:37,878
You think you're God Almighty,
but you know what you are?

1221
01:35:37,960 --> 01:35:39,279
You're a cheap...

1222
01:35:39,360 --> 01:35:41,874
...Iousy, dirty, stinking mug...

1223
01:35:42,240 --> 01:35:44,356
...and I'm glad what I done to you!

1224
01:35:44,640 --> 01:35:45,834
You hear that?

1225
01:35:45,920 --> 01:35:47,638
I'm glad what I done!

1226
01:35:48,480 --> 01:35:50,948
And I'm going to keep on doing it till I get--

1227
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:52,671
Come on, come on.

1228
01:36:20,600 --> 01:36:22,591
That boy fights like he used to.

1229
01:36:33,760 --> 01:36:35,876
-They'll kill him.
-It's a massacre.

1230
01:36:35,960 --> 01:36:37,791
He's one of theirs anyway.

1231
01:36:41,640 --> 01:36:43,756
-What are we waiting for?
-Let's go!

1232
01:36:45,720 --> 01:36:46,914
That's enough.

1233
01:36:47,880 --> 01:36:49,518
Just let him lay there.

1234
01:37:11,920 --> 01:37:13,114
What happened?

1235
01:37:16,560 --> 01:37:18,073
Jimmy, what happened?

1236
01:37:25,560 --> 01:37:27,039
Where are you going?

1237
01:37:27,280 --> 01:37:28,349
Let me by.

1238
01:37:43,200 --> 01:37:44,349
You want him?

1239
01:37:47,040 --> 01:37:48,393
You can have him!

1240
01:37:54,160 --> 01:37:55,878
The little rat's yours.

1241
01:38:07,440 --> 01:38:09,635
Get some fresh water!

1242
01:38:12,920 --> 01:38:14,035
Terry.

1243
01:38:16,200 --> 01:38:17,474
Who's in charge here?

1244
01:38:17,560 --> 01:38:19,755
Yours truly is in charge here.

1245
01:38:19,840 --> 01:38:22,718
We got to get this ship out of here.
It's costing us money.

1246
01:38:22,800 --> 01:38:23,994
Blow your whistle.

1247
01:38:24,080 --> 01:38:26,071
All right you guys, get to work!

1248
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:27,989
Come on!

1249
01:38:28,600 --> 01:38:31,478
-What goes?
-I'll have them working in two minutes.

1250
01:38:31,880 --> 01:38:34,269
He better get these men to work.

1251
01:38:36,560 --> 01:38:39,028
Come on, you guys, on the double!
Get to work!

1252
01:38:39,120 --> 01:38:42,032
Come on. Get in there. Get in there.

1253
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:45,878
-How about Terry?
-lf he don't work, we don't work.

1254
01:38:46,040 --> 01:38:48,076
Work! He can't even walk!

1255
01:38:48,600 --> 01:38:51,592
You want to know who works?
The ones I pick to work.

1256
01:38:51,680 --> 01:38:54,274
Now get going.
Come on all of you, get in there.

1257
01:38:56,320 --> 01:38:57,992
Come on, get out here.

1258
01:38:58,120 --> 01:39:00,315
Come on, Pop, on the double,
you work today.

1259
01:39:00,400 --> 01:39:02,789
All my life you pushed me around.

1260
01:39:02,960 --> 01:39:04,393
Come on.

1261
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:18,831
Come on, you walk in with them.

1262
01:39:26,880 --> 01:39:30,919
If Terry walks in, we walk in with him.
They're waiting for him to walk in.

1263
01:39:40,880 --> 01:39:42,552
Did you hear that, Terry?

1264
01:39:43,840 --> 01:39:46,274
Terry, did you hear that?

1265
01:39:46,360 --> 01:39:47,349
Yeah.

1266
01:39:48,160 --> 01:39:52,153
You lost the battle,
but you have a chance to win the war.

1267
01:39:53,880 --> 01:39:55,711
-What do I have to do?
-Walk.

1268
01:39:56,200 --> 01:39:57,394
Can you walk?

1269
01:39:58,520 --> 01:39:59,953
-Walk.
-Yes, walk.

1270
01:40:01,920 --> 01:40:03,638
To the pier, I mean.

1271
01:40:03,720 --> 01:40:06,280
-We'll walk in with you.
-So the shippers can see...

1272
01:40:06,360 --> 01:40:08,828
...we'll take no more orders
from Johnny Friendly.

1273
01:40:08,920 --> 01:40:12,674
Then it'll give us back our union,
so we can run it on the up and up.

1274
01:40:13,200 --> 01:40:16,112
Johnny Friendly's laying odds
that you won't get up.

1275
01:40:19,440 --> 01:40:22,352
What are you standing around for?
Come on, help me!

1276
01:40:23,440 --> 01:40:24,793
Come on, you guys.

1277
01:40:26,480 --> 01:40:29,756
Put me on my feet. Come on.

1278
01:40:40,800 --> 01:40:41,994
How you doing?

1279
01:40:44,320 --> 01:40:45,912
Am I on my feet?

1280
01:40:47,280 --> 01:40:48,759
You're on your feet.

1281
01:40:51,240 --> 01:40:53,629
-I don't think I'm gonna make it.
-Terry!

1282
01:40:54,680 --> 01:40:55,669
You can.

1283
01:40:59,320 --> 01:41:02,437
Just finish what you started. You can.

1284
01:41:10,040 --> 01:41:11,359
Give me my hook.

1285
01:41:11,680 --> 01:41:13,955
Look, for God's sake,
what're you trying to do?

1286
01:41:14,040 --> 01:41:16,315
Take your hands off him. Keep going.

1287
01:41:21,240 --> 01:41:22,559
Leave him alone!

1288
01:42:22,880 --> 01:42:25,030
All right, let's go to work!

1289
01:42:37,520 --> 01:42:39,875
Where you guys going? Wait a minute.

1290
01:42:40,440 --> 01:42:43,876
I'll remember this.
I'll remember every one of you!

1291
01:42:45,320 --> 01:42:47,550
I'll be back! Don't you forget that!

1292
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:49,479
I'll be back!
