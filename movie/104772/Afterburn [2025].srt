1
00:00:45,134 --> 00:00:49,994
经历令人难以承受的启示前阶段
After an overwhelming pre-revelation
2
00:00:50,126 --> 00:00:54,606
我在各处找到了一切人和事
I found everything and everyone everywhere
3
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:56,998
我这么说不是为了炫耀 但有些人
I don't say this to brag but some
4
00:00:57,228 --> 00:00:59,736
称我为世界上最棒的寻宝者
called me the best treasure hunter in the world
5
00:00:59,819 --> 00:01:01,996
没什么可找的了
There was nothing left to find
6
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:05,308
大部分时间我都处于
For most of the time I was under
7
00:01:05,391 --> 00:01:07,800
水下 数世纪以来一直在寻找宝藏
water searching for things for centuries
8
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:14,060
我独自工作 我开展研究且独自开始
I worked alone I conducted research and started alone
9
00:01:14,913 --> 00:01:16,325
但这很适合我
But that suited me
11
00:01:20,833 --> 00:01:24,693
但当阳光闪现时一切都变了
But everything changed when the solar flare struck
12
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:30,980
人们陷入黑暗与混乱之中
People were plunged into darkness and chaos
13
00:01:31,279 --> 00:01:33,992
所有现代电子设备都停止运转
All modern electronics stopped working
14
00:01:35,126 --> 00:01:37,009
大多数东西现在都毫无用处
Most things were now useless
15
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:42,206
人们曾相信政府会掌控局面
People believed the governments would take control of them
16
00:01:42,613 --> 00:01:43,633
可笑的欲望
Foolish desires
17
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:47,805
战士们夺取了权力 掌控了当地社区
Warriors seized power and took over the local community
18
00:01:48,559 --> 00:01:52,089
掌控了政府 并占领了欧洲大部分地区
Took over governments and occupied most of Europe
19
00:01:53,368 --> 00:01:56,075
六年后 他们曾以为
Six years after they thought
20
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:58,809
一切都会好起来
Everything would turn out well
21
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:01,738
当然 我知道等待我的是什么
Of course I knew what awaited me
22
00:02:03,629 --> 00:02:05,982
饥饿的城市变成了坟墓
Starving cities became cemeteries
23
00:02:06,737 --> 00:02:08,032
金钱失去了任何价值
Money had no value
24
00:02:08,570 --> 00:02:10,647
没有药品也没有燃料
There were no medicines or fuel
25
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:12,170
疾病肆虐
Diseases took hold
26
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:16,245
或许我准备得更充分
Maybe I was more prepared
27
00:02:16,983 --> 00:02:18,631
我生来就是幸存者
I was born a survivor
28
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:21,685
而且我很快就做了
我一直想做的事
And very quickly I did what I always do
29
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:23,030
我寻找各种东西
I found various things
30
00:02:24,789 --> 00:02:28,029
只是现在的世界已经变得非常危险
Only the world was now a much more dangerous place...
31
00:02:33,966 --> 00:02:36,792
（伦敦 - 英国）
（London - England）
32
00:03:07,401 --> 00:03:14,408
基金中的资金告急
Critical in the Fund of Funds
33
00:05:30,417 --> 00:05:31,695
非常简单
Very easy
34
00:06:13,979 --> 00:06:19,240
O .G. I. D.
O .G. I. D.
35
00:06:57,179 --> 00:07:01,426
A. D. A. G. I. O.
A. D. A. G. I. O.
36
00:07:23,726 --> 00:07:25,062
我抓到你了
I got you
37
00:07:55,446 --> 00:07:56,446
好的
All right
38
00:08:16,077 --> 00:08:17,077
好的
All right
39
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:20,437
看看警察是不是回来了
To see if the police are back
40
00:08:20,693 --> 00:08:21,693
嘿 老伙计
Hey old man
41
00:08:22,126 --> 00:08:23,846
你在这干什么
What are you doing here
42
00:08:23,973 --> 00:08:24,973
等一下
Wait a minute
43
00:08:26,539 --> 00:08:28,657
你们不是真警察
对吧
You're not real policemen are you
44
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:36,140
包里装的是什么
What's in the bag
45
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:39,157
我觉得是小提琴
或许是中提琴
I think it's a violin. Maybe a viola
46
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,117
说实话 我看不出区别
Honestly I don't see the difference
47
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,057
怎么了 你会演奏吗
给我
Why? Do you play? Give
48
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:42,140
给我

49
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:43,891
不 你不会想要这个的
No you don't want this
50
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:48,009
但我可以把里面的东西给你
But I'll give you what's inside
51
00:08:50,593 --> 00:08:52,954
我会把子弹塞满你的嘴
I'll fill your mouth with bullets
52
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:56,240
你们抓不住我们所有人
You can't catch all of us
53
00:08:57,167 --> 00:08:58,226
不 没关系
No it's all right
54
00:08:58,960 --> 00:08:59,960
只要抓你就行
Just you
55
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:02,300
还有你
And you
56
00:09:03,233 --> 00:09:04,233
还有你
And you
57
00:09:04,647 --> 00:09:06,000
我会开枪打你
And I'll shoot you...
58
00:09:07,153 --> 00:09:09,153
肯定还有你
And definitely you
59
00:09:10,993 --> 00:09:12,433
伙计们 抓住他
Guys catch him
60
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:29,351
该死
Damn it
61
00:09:33,758 --> 00:09:34,851
该死
Damn it
62
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:51,180
威力真小
Weak explosion
63
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:57,190
呃
Eh
64
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:58,367
有
Did
65
00:10:58,450 --> 00:10:58,776
找到吗 找到了
you find it? Yes
66
00:10:58,963 --> 00:11:00,611
就在你说的地方
Exactly where you said
67
00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:03,927
我派了几个人去那
但他们都空手而归
I sent a few men there but they came back empty-handed
68
00:11:04,010 --> 00:11:05,716
有些人甚至没回来
Some didn't even come back
69
00:11:06,432 --> 00:11:07,516
斯特拉迪瓦里小提琴
Stradivarius
70
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:09,753
黄金时期 1690-1700 年
Golden period 1690-1700...
71
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:12,470
非常好
Perfect
72
00:11:15,383 --> 00:11:17,583
奥古斯特国王有
另一个任务给你
King August has another task for you
73
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:20,160
他现在
算是国王了吗
Is he... a king now
74
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:21,030
算是王室成员
They're royal
75
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:23,606
他认为这是
最安全的回归方式
He thinks it's the safest way back...
76
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:24,824
他想见你
He wants to see you
77
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:26,752
我差点丧命
就为了找这把
小提琴 所以不了 谢谢
I almost died to find these violins so no thank you
78
00:11:26,835 --> 00:11:29,027
因为它们的珍贵
所以不了 谢谢
because of their majesty so no thank you
79
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:30,246
我要去造我的船
I'm going to build my boat
80
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:31,756
他愿意给你报酬
He's willing to give you a reward
81
00:11:32,489 --> 00:11:33,489
而且报酬很丰厚
A very good one
82
00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:35,578
足够买你梦想中的船
Enough for the boat of your dreams
83
00:11:37,210 --> 00:11:38,210
任务在哪
Where is this job
84
00:11:40,010 --> 00:11:40,927
在英吉利海峡对岸
On the other side of the English Channel
85
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:42,610
和他谈好的条件
As you negotiated with him
86
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:44,416
想想吧 杰克
Just think Jake...
87
00:11:45,205 --> 00:11:46,970
这可能是新的开始
This could be a new beginning
88
00:11:47,093 --> 00:11:49,786
如果我想要新开始
不会拿生命去冒险
If I wanted a new beginning I wouldn't risk my life for it
89
00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:51,167
不 我们会安全送你去那
No we'll get you there safely
90
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:55,675
那里除了疾病
埃德姆的战士和音乐什么都没有
There's nothing there but disease warriors Edm and music
91
00:11:56,168 --> 00:11:57,816
谢谢 不过
见到你我很高兴
Thanks. But I'm glad I saw you
92
00:11:59,770 --> 00:12:00,379
杰克
Jake!
93
00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:01,590
你看起来气色不错
You look great
94
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:03,586
很适合穿这身礼服
That suit suits you
95
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:16,670
我拒绝
Refusal
96
00:12:18,136 --> 00:12:20,336
他宁愿自己造船
He'd rather build his own boat
97
00:12:23,523 --> 00:12:24,556
你信吗
Can you believe that
98
00:12:27,926 --> 00:12:29,816
太可惜了
That's a tragedy
99
00:12:31,316 --> 00:12:33,247
最好给杰克出个价
Better make Jake an offer
100
00:12:33,330 --> 00:12:35,511
一个他
无法拒绝的出价
An offer he won't be able to refuse
101
00:13:52,366 --> 00:13:53,366
哦 老朋友
Oh friend
102
00:14:01,133 --> 00:14:02,653
好吧 你来了
Well you're here

00:14:03,751 --> 00:14:04,883

Yes
104
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,655

好孩子
Good boy
108
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:14,340
好孩子

110
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:18,380
我的小伙子 喜欢吗
my boy? Yes
111
00:14:20,026 --> 00:14:21,026
干得好
Good job
112
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:26,856
上好的油
Excellent oil
113
00:16:12,112 --> 00:16:13,112
你在这干什么
What are you doing here
114
00:16:13,769 --> 00:16:14,769
摩尔
Moor
115
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:16,680
国王派我来的
The king sent me
116
00:16:18,473 --> 00:16:20,217
至于那个任务
告诉他我不想要
As for that job tell him I don't want it
117
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:21,359
你当面跟他说
Tell him that to his face
118
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:23,750
他在垃圾填埋场等你
He's waiting for you at the landfill
119
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:32,670
哎呀
Well!
120
00:16:33,076 --> 00:16:34,312
能帮我下去吗
Can you help me get down
121
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:36,390
哎呀
Well!
122
00:17:02,861 --> 00:17:03,861
杰克
Jake!
123
00:17:04,267 --> 00:17:05,166
进来
Come in
124
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:06,250
坐下
Sit down
125
00:17:06,562 --> 00:17:07,915
坐下 我们谈谈
Sit down let's talk
126
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:14,320
告诉我
Tell me...
127
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:16,720
告诉我
Tell me...
128
00:17:16,779 --> 00:17:17,819
你怎么样
How are you
129
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:18,960
我来这干嘛
What am I doing here
130
00:17:19,387 --> 00:17:22,192
我雇了很多人
但看起来
I hired many people but it seems that...
131
00:17:22,275 --> 00:17:26,435
你是唯一能找到
别人找不到的东西的人
...you're the only person who finds things others can't
132
00:17:27,001 --> 00:17:30,140
这是某种特殊技能
还是个人魅力
Is it some special skill or charisma
133
00:17:31,261 --> 00:17:32,457
说到个人魅力
Speaking of charisma...
134
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:33,785
这些布料
These fabrics
135
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:35,462
很不错
Are excellent
136
00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:38,570
很神圣的材质
Something divine
137
00:17:38,753 --> 00:17:39,753
这音乐
This music
138
00:17:40,327 --> 00:17:42,457
能让高大的男人都落泪
Makes even big men cry
139
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:44,195
或许在尝试组建
交响乐团之前
Maybe before trying to form a symphony orchestra
140
00:17:44,278 --> 00:17:46,477
你得先解决
食物和干净水的问题
you should start with food and clean water
141
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:49,090
你觉得我们
没在努力解决
Do you think we're not trying to solve the problem
142
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:52,256
食物问题吗 杰克
这家伙嘴里
塞满了牛排还说这话
of food Jake? The guy is talking with his mouth full of steak
143
00:17:52,606 --> 00:17:53,846
我只吃鱼
I only eat fish
144
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:59,337
你觉得收拾
这烂摊子很容易吗
你觉得
Do you think cleaning up this mess is an easy task? Do you think
145
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:03,362
我们只要打个响指
就能点亮灯吗
it's like we can just snap our fingers and turn on the lights
146
00:18:04,411 --> 00:18:06,676
所有该死的基础设施
都被毁了
All the damn infrastructure has been destroyed
147
00:18:06,759 --> 00:18:09,656
我们每天都在拼命工作
努力从头建设一切
Every day we're drowning in work trying to build everything from scratch
148
00:18:09,739 --> 00:18:14,890
还在和沃尔科夫将军这样的人战斗
他们试图阻止我们
and fighting people like General Volkov who are trying to stop us
149
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:16,520
好 行吧
Yes all right
150
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:19,697
那家伙就算被文化砸到脸
也认不出文化是什么
That guy wouldn't recognize culture even if it hit him in the face
151
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:21,200
他就是混乱的代理人
He's an agent of chaos
152
00:18:22,833 --> 00:18:25,775
他就想看着世界燃烧
然后统治灰烬
He wants to watch the world burn and rule over the ashes
153
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:28,501
而你看法不同
And you see it differently...
154
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:31,473
愤世嫉俗罢了
Cynicism
155
00:18:32,033 --> 00:18:33,975
相信我 我跟你说的是真的 杰克
Believe me when I tell you this Jake
156
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:36,639
这不是我想要的工作
This is not the job I wanted
157
00:18:37,397 --> 00:18:39,857
闪光爆发时
我们失去了人性
When the flare hit we lost our humanity
158
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:42,058
你也亲眼看到了
人们在黑暗中做的事
You saw for yourself what people did in the dark
159
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:45,390
没人想到
世界会垮得这么快
No one expected the world to collapse so quickly
160
00:18:47,453 --> 00:18:48,512
世界陷入了恐慌
The world panicked
161
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:51,185
有些人变成了野蛮人
Some became barbarians
162
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:53,493
看看你自己
Look at yourself
163
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,874
你建造的那些菲尔迪什塔楼
Those Fildish towers you're building...
164
00:18:55,957 --> 00:18:58,497
是为了困住野蛮人
保证安全
...to keep the barbarians out to be safe
165
00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:01,639
不是每个人都像你这么
有想法 杰克
Not everyone is as resourceful as you Jake
166
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:05,411
他们没有你的能力和勇气
在这个新世界生存下去
They don't have your skills and courage to survive in this new world
167
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,316
他们需要保护
They need protection
168
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:11,455
没有这些城墙
很多人早就死了
Without these walls many more would be dead
169
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,077
那城墙外的人呢
What about those outside the walls
170
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,397
那些躲藏起来的人呢
What about those who are hiding
171
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:15,337
你不管他们吗
Do you leave them
172
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:16,773
不 杰克
所有人都受欢迎
No Jake. Everyone is welcome
173
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:18,900
包括你
Even you
174
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:31,520
富恩特斯部长跟我说
他不想横渡英吉利海峡
Minister Fuentes told me he doesn't want to cross the English Channel
175
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:32,480
对 我不想
No I don't
176
00:19:32,564 --> 00:19:34,220
我坚决反对
I'm firmly opposed
177
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:37,843
或许是因为你
还没看到更广阔的前景
Maybe because you haven't seen the bigger picture yet
178
00:19:39,410 --> 00:19:40,717
我不想看更广阔的前景
I don't want to see the bigger picture
179
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:43,134
大局既丑陋又艰难
The big picture is ugly and hard
180
00:19:45,586 --> 00:19:46,786
也不尽然
Not entirely
181
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:51,404
我们正竭尽全力
恢复世界的美好
We're doing our best to bring back the beauty of the world
182
00:19:52,992 --> 00:19:54,463
你是自由的人 杰克
You're a free man Jake
183
00:19:56,106 --> 00:19:57,106
不受约束
Unrestrained
184
00:19:59,186 --> 00:20:00,892
不用向任何人负责
You don't answer to anyone
185
00:20:01,133 --> 00:20:02,604
我只需要风
I just need wind
186
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:06,084
我只想驾着我的船
离开这烂摊子
I just want to take my boat and leave this mess behind
187
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:11,690
我和这些人
都想要属于自己的世界 杰克
These people and I want our own world Jake
188
00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:14,912
这次你要找的
又是什么
What is it that you should be hunting this time
189
00:20:16,890 --> 00:20:18,063
独一无二的东西
The one
190
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:22,270
《蒙娜丽莎》吗
The Mona Lisa
191
00:20:22,370 --> 00:20:24,167
在这该死的美景之中
Among all this damn beauty
192
00:20:26,056 --> 00:20:28,516
我不想扫你的兴
你很棒
I don't want to ruin your mood you're great
193
00:20:29,230 --> 00:20:31,607
但巴黎是最早
被烧毁的城市之一
But Paris was one of the first cities to burn
194
00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:32,172
当然
Of course
195
00:20:32,330 --> 00:20:33,330
当然
Of course
196
00:20:34,456 --> 00:20:36,398
但有些事你可能不知道
But there's something you might not know
197
00:20:36,870 --> 00:20:40,450
闪光爆发时
法国政府
把所有国宝
When the flare hit the French government moved all national treasures
198
00:20:40,533 --> 00:20:44,131
转移到了一个秘密避难所
to a secret bunker
199
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:48,970
从艺术品
到总统的银质餐具
Everything from works of art to the president's silverware
200
00:20:52,166 --> 00:20:53,990
我怎么才能
进去呢
And how am I supposed to get in there
201
00:20:54,866 --> 00:20:57,925
坐皇家飞机
由皇家飞行员驾驶
With a royal plane and a royal pilot
202
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:00,996
那我能拿到船吗
还有所有
So will I get the boat? With all the
203
00:21:01,935 --> 00:21:04,288
必需的补给和食物
necessary supplies and food
204
00:21:04,673 --> 00:21:06,513
我还会给你一个头衔
Ill give you a title too
205
00:21:07,965 --> 00:21:11,525
要是富恩特斯是
国防部长的话
Well if Fuentes is the Minister of Defense...
206
00:21:12,635 --> 00:21:16,613
那你 国王
能给我什么呢
...then what can you King do for me
207
00:21:19,376 --> 00:21:21,906
文化事务总监
Director General of Cultural Lullage
208
00:21:38,526 --> 00:21:39,526
哦 老朋友
Oh friend
209
00:21:39,607 --> 00:21:40,607
是啊
Yes
210
00:21:42,767 --> 00:21:43,767
是啊
Yes
211
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:45,697
我不会错过太多的 老伙计
I won't miss much old man
212
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:47,545
我会在你明白之前
就回来的
I'll be back before you know it
213
00:21:58,966 --> 00:21:59,966
你怎么样
How are you
214
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:01,220
嗯 我还好
Well I'm fine
215
00:22:01,673 --> 00:22:02,673
你呢
And you;
216
00:22:04,114 --> 00:22:05,857
我觉得这是个很糟糕的主意
I think this is a very bad idea
217
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:07,857
你总是有点冒险精神
You always take a bit of a risk
218
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:11,668
是啊 既然我总是这样
那为什么还要
去地球最糟糕的地方呢
Yes since I always do that why go to the worst part of the planet
219
00:22:14,193 --> 00:22:16,723
我在小屋里
留了很多食物和水
I left a lot of food and water in the hut
220
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:21,644
你能保证
如果我没能
Will you promise that if I don't
221
00:22:22,297 --> 00:22:24,709
回来 你会照顾它吗
come back you'll take care of it? I have no one to ask
222
00:22:26,707 --> 00:22:29,002
我觉得索莫基
不会忽悠我
I don't think Somoki is messing with me
223
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:32,743
我不确定它是否信任你
I'm not sure if it trusts you
224
00:22:37,986 --> 00:22:39,266
我会尽量活下去
I'll try not to die
225
00:22:41,676 --> 00:22:43,500
在我回来之前
保重
Take care until I get back
226
00:22:43,869 --> 00:22:44,869
一切都会好的
Everything will be fine
227
00:23:33,230 --> 00:23:34,878
令人窒息 对吧
Breathtaking isn't it
228
00:23:36,808 --> 00:23:38,476
是啊 这里真美
Yes it's very beautiful here
229
00:23:42,037 --> 00:23:43,037
我们要往这个方向走吗
Are we going this way
230
00:23:44,376 --> 00:23:45,376
对
Yes
231
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:46,590
这里安全吗
Is this safe
232
00:23:47,290 --> 00:23:49,417
严格来说 不安全
到处都是弹孔
Technically no... it's full of bullet holes
233
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:50,500
这些吗
These
234
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:52,208
不 这些是上周的
No these are from last week
235
00:23:52,291 --> 00:23:54,174
跟那帮孩子
有点小误会
A little misunderstanding with some kids
236
00:23:55,630 --> 00:23:56,748
国王在等你
The king is waiting
237
00:23:57,443 --> 00:23:58,443
别迟到
Don't be late
238
00:24:02,858 --> 00:24:05,041
我们先不告诉你详情
We'll leave you in the dark for now
239
00:24:05,170 --> 00:24:09,047
投放点在这
离这个村庄不远
The drop point is here not far from this village
240
00:24:09,367 --> 00:24:12,366
根据我们的情报
这里全是游击队员
According to our information it's all partisans here
241
00:24:12,790 --> 00:24:16,579
之后你得往北走
去圣凯克
Then you need to go north to Saint-Cake
242
00:24:17,370 --> 00:24:20,959
那是个被占领的城市
所以你得悄悄行动
It's an occupied city so you have to move quietly
243
00:24:21,670 --> 00:24:22,670
像耳语一样轻
Like a whisper
244
00:24:23,010 --> 00:24:25,288
像该死的老鼠一样轻
Like a damn mouse
245
00:24:25,550 --> 00:24:31,450
到了市中心
你就能找到
我们的联系人了
Once you reach the city center that's where you'll find our contact
246
00:24:36,643 --> 00:24:37,643
市中心
City center
247
00:24:39,796 --> 00:24:41,208
这可够远的
That's quite a lot
248
00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:42,846
我怎么在地狱般的地方
找到他们
How do I find them in this hell
249
00:24:42,870 --> 00:24:44,427
别担心
他们会找到你的
Don't worry. They'll find you
250
00:24:44,510 --> 00:24:46,970
一切都非常
机密 不能外泄
Everything is extremely confidential in cups
251
00:24:47,837 --> 00:24:49,490
只告诉
知情的人
Only for those who know
252
00:24:49,630 --> 00:24:51,336
是 我得知道
Yes I need to know
253
00:24:52,530 --> 00:24:53,766
我需要知道什么
我得知道
What do I need to know? I need to
254
00:24:54,130 --> 00:24:56,619
怎么从那
逃出来
know how to get out of there
255
00:24:56,702 --> 00:25:00,910
游击队员会联系我
只要我拿到东西
对吧
The partisans will contact me as soon as I pick it up right
256
00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:05,546
你明白吗 我会给你送
逃生装备
三小时后送到
You understand? And I'll send you escape equipment three hours later
257
00:25:06,769 --> 00:25:07,769
三小时
Three hours
258
00:25:08,462 --> 00:25:11,228
保重
这飞机到处都是洞
Be well. - This plane is full of holes
259
00:25:11,311 --> 00:25:12,606
我没注意到
I didn't notice that
260
00:25:13,790 --> 00:25:16,135
我们晚上十点起飞
We take off at ten in the evening
261
00:25:16,677 --> 00:25:17,677
我的人
My man
262
00:25:24,610 --> 00:25:25,610
好
Ok
263
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:32,623
好了 一切准备就绪
开始行动
All right everything is ready let's start
264
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:38,852
安全带坏了
The seatbelts are broken
265
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,377
别啰嗦了 老伙计
Give it a rest old man
266
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:43,417
这廉价尼龙
要是我们坠机了
根本没用 对吧
This cheap nylon won't help you if we crash right
267
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:45,460
好了 开始吧
Well let's do this
268
00:26:28,147 --> 00:26:31,442
好了吗
好了 我再算几笔
All right? - Yes I'll just do a few calculations
269
00:26:32,430 --> 00:26:35,267
是啊 我不确定 这个指示器
能不能正常工作
Yes I'm not sure if this indicator works properly
270
00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:36,426
先这么算吧
Let's just say it does
271
00:26:36,450 --> 00:26:38,407
我原以为我们会待在路中间 所以 ...
I thought we'd stay in the middle of the road so ...
272
00:26:38,490 --> 00:26:41,707
哦 还是用降落伞吧 不管怎样
Oh better use the parachute for better or worse
273
00:26:41,790 --> 00:26:42,790
好
Ok
274
00:26:53,870 --> 00:26:55,567
拉这个就能打开降落伞 对吧
I pull this to open the parachute right
275
00:26:55,650 --> 00:26:58,150
等等 你不再演示一次吗
Wait. Aren't you going to do this again
276
00:26:59,263 --> 00:27:00,263
不
No
277
00:27:00,362 --> 00:27:01,530
该死的门外汉
Damn amateur
278
00:27:01,970 --> 00:27:04,650
对 你得拉这条带子
Yes. You have to pull this strap
279
00:27:05,510 --> 00:27:06,367
拉哪条
Which one to pull
280
00:27:06,450 --> 00:27:09,392
我不知道 大概在撞到地面前吧
I don't know. Probably before hitting the ground
281
00:27:10,210 --> 00:27:12,550
冷静点 吃点东西
Calm down. Eat something
282
00:27:13,010 --> 00:27:15,246
我带你偏离航线 好吗
I'm taking you off the flight path ok
283
00:27:16,910 --> 00:27:18,910
开始震动了
It's starting to shake
284
00:27:23,630 --> 00:27:25,587
好 冷静点
Ok. Calm down
285
00:27:25,670 --> 00:27:26,670
好
Yes
286
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:12,937
该死 抓紧了 老伙计
Shit! Hold on old man
287
00:28:13,021 --> 00:28:14,524
他们看起来像沃尔科夫的人
They look like Volkov's men
288
00:28:14,607 --> 00:28:17,364
欢迎来到法国 混蛋
Welcome to France asshole
289
00:28:21,187 --> 00:28:22,926
好 我们这么办
All right let's do this the following way
290
00:28:23,010 --> 00:28:24,408
我试着从这边飞出去
I'll try to fly out from this side
291
00:28:24,491 --> 00:28:26,653
不过得提前跳一点

我也在想这个问题

沃尔科夫在每条路上都部署了坦克
Volkov has placed a tank on every road
436
00:45:03,939 --> 00:45:07,251
我们得穿过旧工厂 然后上东边的路

00:45:27,691 --> 00:45:29,162
上帝知道可能是谁
God knows who it might be
443
00:45:30,345 --> 00:45:31,425
马上出来
Come out now
444
00:45:31,819 --> 00:45:32,979
不管你在哪
Wherever you are
445
00:45:33,079 --> 00:45:34,079
好
Ok
446
00:45:34,299 --> 00:45:35,299
谢谢
Thanks
447
00:45:36,752 --> 00:45:38,870
我等不及想知道接下来会发生什么了
I can't wait to see what happens next
448
00:45:53,691 --> 00:45:55,103
晚上好 先生们
Good evening gentlemen
449
00:45:57,039 --> 00:45:58,219
为我们的健康干杯
To our health
450
00:45:58,519 --> 00:45:59,696
我们知道你是谁
We know who you are
451
00:46:00,239 --> 00:46:01,769
我们知道这里发生了什么
We know what's going on here
452
00:46:02,406 --> 00:46:04,112
你不能再躲了 神父
You can't hide anymore priest
453
00:46:05,545 --> 00:46:06,905
我没什么好躲的
I have nothing to hide
454
00:46:08,092 --> 00:46:09,132
上帝看得见一切
God sees everything
455
00:46:09,459 --> 00:46:10,459
其他人在哪
Where are the others
456
00:46:10,732 --> 00:46:11,732
其他人呢
And the others
457
00:46:12,492 --> 00:46:13,616
这里没有别人了
There's no one else here
458
00:46:13,699 --> 00:46:14,699
只有我
Just me
459
00:46:19,259 --> 00:46:21,976
那里找到的一切 都是上帝的杰作
Everything found there is the work of God
460
00:46:23,499 --> 00:46:26,509
教堂现在关门了 但如果你想
The church is closed now but you can come in
461
00:46:26,592 --> 00:46:29,867
忏悔你的罪过 可以进来
if you want to confess your sins
462
00:46:30,798 --> 00:46:31,938
我是无神论者
I'm an atheist
463
00:46:32,419 --> 00:46:33,419
当然
Of course
464
00:46:33,846 --> 00:46:35,199
或许这样更好
Maybe it's better that way
465
00:46:36,059 --> 00:46:40,439
因为宽恕罪过需要 意识到错误并有改正的意愿
Because forgiveness of sins requires awareness and the will to improve
466
00:46:41,239 --> 00:46:43,979
而这些品质 你显然没有
Qualities you clearly don't have
467
00:46:45,679 --> 00:46:51,179
因为你是黑暗的一部分 在这个苦难的世界里蔓延
Because you are part of the darkness that spreads in this afflicted world
468
00:46:52,784 --> 00:46:55,643
而你 赢不了
And you... won't win
469
00:47:00,638 --> 00:47:03,578
愿上帝原谅我 即将做的事
May God forgive me for what I'm about to do
470
00:47:06,039 --> 00:47:07,039
不许动
Don't move
471
00:47:09,078 --> 00:47:10,431
从车里出来
Get out of the car
472
00:47:10,515 --> 00:47:13,555
我想引用一段启示录 第三章 第五十七节
I would like to quote this revelation Chapter three verse 57
473
00:47:37,449 --> 00:47:39,794
你没必要这么做
You didn't have to do that
474
00:47:40,269 --> 00:47:43,549
你没必要这么做 别催了 我不会喂他的
You didn't have to do that... Don't rush I won't feed him
475
00:47:43,769 --> 00:47:45,645
该死 该死
Shit shit
476
00:47:46,927 --> 00:47:48,195
该死的神父
Damn priest
477
00:47:48,649 --> 00:47:50,120
说真的 该死的神父
Really damn priest
478
00:47:52,222 --> 00:47:53,267
对了 你真不怎么样
By the way you're bad
479
00:47:53,350 --> 00:47:55,152
带子
The strap
480
00:47:55,649 --> 00:47:56,649
好 好
Yes yes
481
00:48:03,899 --> 00:48:04,939
打开牢门
Open the cell
482
00:48:05,239 --> 00:48:06,945
从这该死的门出去呼吸
Breathe through these damn doors
483
00:48:13,559 --> 00:48:14,799
带我们离开这
Get us out of here
484
00:48:15,079 --> 00:48:16,079
开火
Fire
485
00:48:19,059 --> 00:48:20,059
稳住
Hold steady
486
00:48:22,712 --> 00:48:24,152
跟紧他们
Follow them
487
00:48:24,459 --> 00:48:25,459
走
Go
488
00:48:25,999 --> 00:48:27,705
我们刚才是不是跳过马车了
Did we just jump over a carriage
489
00:48:28,439 --> 00:48:30,204
我们就是跳过马车了
We just jumped over a carriage
490
00:48:37,184 --> 00:48:40,280
头儿 检查通讯
Boss check the communications
491
00:48:40,478 --> 00:48:41,478
不行
No
492
00:48:41,559 --> 00:48:42,736
我们直着开
We're driving straight
493
00:48:44,119 --> 00:48:45,726
这该死的是什么
What the hell is this
494
00:48:54,792 --> 00:48:55,969
是防弹的
It's bulletproof
495
00:49:02,018 --> 00:49:03,592
开火
Fire
496
00:49:13,654 --> 00:49:15,654
向右转
Turn right
497
00:49:25,296 --> 00:49:26,360
去哪
Where
498
00:49:26,515 --> 00:49:27,515
进隧道
Go into the tunnel
499
00:49:38,924 --> 00:49:41,004
快点

刹车
Brakes
501
00:50:04,203 --> 00:50:06,234
这家伙有多少辆坦克
How many tanks does this guy have
502
00:50:10,109 --> 00:50:10,509
杰克
Jake
503
00:50:10,649 --> 00:50:11,649
该死
Shit
504
00:50:31,565 --> 00:50:32,565
我们被包围了
We're surrounded
505
00:50:37,019 --> 00:50:38,421
这下要乱了
This is going to be a mess
506
00:50:52,907 --> 00:50:55,886
冷静 冷静 我不怕他们
Easy easy I'm not afraid of them
507
00:50:57,945 --> 00:50:59,339
我更担心这个
This worries me more
508
00:51:14,888 --> 00:51:16,604
左 左 左
Left left left
509
00:51:35,270 --> 00:51:37,270
油箱 我知道
The tank I know
510
00:51:40,219 --> 00:51:42,939
杰克 我知道
Jake I know
511
00:51:45,235 --> 00:51:46,886
杰克 我知道
Jake I know
512
00:51:55,066 --> 00:51:56,338
该死的奥古斯特
Damn August
513
00:51:57,614 --> 00:52:00,412
那混蛋让我找 该死的《蒙娜丽莎》
That bastard told me to find the damn Mona Lisa
514
00:52:00,539 --> 00:52:02,097
就因为他那破爱好
For all his damn greatness
515
00:52:02,180 --> 00:52:04,929
还封了我个该死的部长头衔
And made me a damn minister
516
00:52:05,199 --> 00:52:06,459
走 我们走
Come let's go
517
00:52:06,759 --> 00:52:08,524
国王在我的射程里
The king is in my sights
518
00:52:26,971 --> 00:52:29,442
我们的游击队员朋友有什么新消息
What's new from our partisan friends
519
00:52:29,939 --> 00:52:34,410
杰克和达拉正前往斯武军事基地 执行任务
Jake and Dara are heading to the Swu military base on their mission
520
00:52:34,612 --> 00:52:35,612
不幸的是
Unfortunately
521
00:52:36,965 --> 00:52:39,613
萨姆森神父为我们的目标战斗时牺牲了
Father Samson died fighting for our cause
522
00:52:41,505 --> 00:52:43,265
而且这是个重要的目标
And it's an important cause
523
00:52:44,925 --> 00:52:46,905
愿他安息
May he rest in peace
524
00:52:47,872 --> 00:52:48,872
你很棒
You're great
525
00:52:56,265 --> 00:52:58,030
我有个问题要问你
I have a question for you
526
00:52:58,114 --> 00:52:59,114
说吧
Go ahead
527
00:52:59,299 --> 00:53:02,156
因为该死的 你们所有人都愿意去死
Because damn it all of you are willing to die
528
00:53:02,239 --> 00:53:03,946
就只为了找到那张桌子吗
just to find that table
529
00:53:04,119 --> 00:53:05,119
这和你有什么关系
What's it to you
530
00:53:05,959 --> 00:53:08,036
你会得到
You'll get
531
00:53:08,119 --> 00:53:09,119
钱 对吧 我不明白
money right I don't get it
532
00:53:10,239 --> 00:53:11,768
这是件不错的艺术品 但所有
It's a nice work of art but all
533
00:53:11,851 --> 00:53:13,876
这段经历都有点夸张了
this experience is a bit over the top
534
00:53:13,959 --> 00:53:14,959
好吧
Well
535
00:53:15,645 --> 00:53:19,349
有人喜欢桌子 有人喜欢航海
Some people like tables some like sailing
536
00:53:22,719 --> 00:53:23,719
奥古斯特
August
537
00:53:27,425 --> 00:53:29,249
萨姆森神父的事 我很抱歉
I'm very sorry about Father Samson
538
00:53:32,784 --> 00:53:35,644
我认识萨姆森神父很久了
I've known Father Samson for a long time
539
00:53:35,998 --> 00:53:38,116
在太阳闪光之前就认识了
Long before the solar flare
540
00:53:39,846 --> 00:53:42,407
他为我们的目标做出了巨大牺牲
He made a great sacrifice for our cause
541
00:53:45,191 --> 00:53:46,956
是 所以我才这么说
Yes that's exactly why I said it
542
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:49,016
为了一张桌子 这么多牺牲
So many sacrifices for a table
543
00:53:49,099 --> 00:53:50,217
这不合理
That doesn't make sense
544
00:53:50,978 --> 00:53:52,194
问题在于沃尔科夫
The problem is Volkov
545
00:53:55,679 --> 00:53:57,562
他和蒙娜丽莎有什么关系
What does he have to do with the Mona Lisa
546
00:53:59,444 --> 00:54:02,225
沃尔科夫也在找二号宝藏
Volkov is also looking for Treasure No. 2
547
00:54:02,479 --> 00:54:03,816
如果他比我们先到那里
And if he gets there before us
548
00:54:03,899 --> 00:54:05,429
里面所有东西都会是他的
Everything inside will be his
549
00:54:06,425 --> 00:54:08,661
他们在那里留下的远不止普通艺术品
They left much more than just ordinary works of art there
550
00:54:09,851 --> 00:54:11,015
食物 设备
Food equipment
551
00:54:12,352 --> 00:54:13,352
武器
Weapons
552
00:54:15,105 --> 00:54:16,105
所以
So
553
00:54:16,539 --> 00:54:18,010
所以应该
So it should
554
00:54:18,259 --> 00:54:19,788
让你从那里逃出来
get you out of there
555
00:54:19,839 --> 00:54:20,839
什么
What
556
00:54:20,899 --> 00:54:21,899
是 正是如此
Yes exactly
557
00:54:23,812 --> 00:54:26,036
所以如果我们抓到他 你拿武器
So if we catch him you take the weapons
558
00:54:26,119 --> 00:54:28,412
奥古斯特拿他的画 然后
August takes his paintings and
559
00:54:28,918 --> 00:54:30,036
我拿我的船
I take my boat
560
00:54:31,299 --> 00:54:32,299
正是
Exactly
561
00:54:48,295 --> 00:54:49,135
嘿 杰克
Hey Jake
562
00:54:49,219 --> 00:54:50,219
嘿
Hey
563
00:54:50,339 --> 00:54:51,339
不管怎样
Well regardless
564
00:54:51,559 --> 00:54:52,996
无论结果如何 我真的希望
of how it ends I really hope
565
00:54:53,079 --> 00:54:55,432
你能找到你要找的东西
you find what you're looking for
566
00:54:56,512 --> 00:54:58,042
我做了这艘小船
I made this little boat
567
00:54:58,139 --> 00:54:58,719
谢谢
Thanks
568
00:54:59,019 --> 00:54:59,809
真好
That's nice
569
00:54:59,899 --> 00:55:01,856
我外婆教我折纸
My grandmother taught me to make origami
570
00:55:01,939 --> 00:55:05,351
我们折了很多 然后让别人去发现它们
We made a lot of them and let others find them
571
00:55:05,519 --> 00:55:07,096
我还知道怎么制作炸弹
I also know how to make a bomb
572
00:55:07,179 --> 00:55:09,238
威力足够摧毁坦克的炸弹
A bomb powerful enough to destroy a tank
573
00:55:11,339 --> 00:55:12,339
哇
Wow
574
00:55:12,712 --> 00:55:17,066
嗯 这很好 但不幸的是 在如今的时代 （制作炸弹）更有用
Well that's nice but unfortunately in today's times it's more useful
575
00:55:17,679 --> 00:55:18,679
是
Yes
576
00:55:18,819 --> 00:55:19,819
好
Ok
577
00:55:19,925 --> 00:55:21,018
我们走
Let's go
578
00:56:00,910 --> 00:56:02,852
我们快到城市了 沃尔科夫
We're approaching the city Volkov
579
00:56:02,959 --> 00:56:03,959
好的
All right
580
00:56:25,783 --> 00:56:27,639
你抓到了什么人
Who did you catch
581
00:56:29,578 --> 00:56:31,167
本来有更多人的 长官
There were more of them sir
582
00:56:31,859 --> 00:56:34,896
但他们跑了 那个老头吗
But they got away - The old man
583
00:56:36,585 --> 00:56:38,174
对 那个该死的神父
Yes that damn priest
584
00:56:41,255 --> 00:56:42,903
但那里还有其他人
But there were others there too
585
00:56:43,969 --> 00:56:44,969
多少人
How many
586
00:56:46,909 --> 00:56:47,909
两个
Two
587
00:56:48,709 --> 00:56:50,626
他们还有一辆大卡车
They also had a big truck
588
00:56:50,709 --> 00:56:52,669
该死的会飞的卡车
Damn flying truck
589
00:56:53,569 --> 00:56:56,709
你有坦克 还有 20 个人 （居然没抓住）
You had tanks... and 20 men
590
00:56:56,829 --> 00:56:58,477
他们打了我们个措手不及 长官
They caught us off guard sir
591
00:56:58,649 --> 00:57:00,120
他们突然冒出来的
They appeared out of nowhere
592
00:57:00,529 --> 00:57:02,529
一个病男人和一个女孩
A sick man and a girl
593
00:57:03,842 --> 00:57:04,942
在车里

01:20:05,741 --> 01:20:08,389
“胖子” 和 “小男孩” 但其实还有第三颗
"Fat Man" and "Little Boy" but there was actually a third one
742
01:20:09,255 --> 01:20:10,595
它被截留在了莫斯科
It was intercepted in Moscow
743
01:20:11,675 --> 01:20:15,146
要是红军没有在马扎里受阻
If the Red Army hadn't been blocked in Marjaria
744
01:20:15,655 --> 01:20:16,293
《蒙娜丽莎》
The Mona Lisa
745
01:20:16,376 --> 01:20:21,200
这颗炸弹需要长时间才能引爆 所以他们装了火焰引爆器
This bomb needs a long time to detonate so they installed a flame detonator
746
01:20:21,495 --> 01:20:24,212
没有内置引爆器 这颗炸弹就不会爆炸
Without the built-in detonator this bomb won't explode
747
01:20:24,295 --> 01:20:26,252
所以奥古斯特要拿走炸弹 而你们所有人
So August is going to take the bomb and all of you
748
01:20:26,335 --> 01:20:28,652
还不明白吗 奥古斯特不想用这颗炸弹
Don't you understand August doesn't want to use this bomb
749
01:20:28,735 --> 01:20:30,392
他只是想让它远离沃尔科夫
He just wants to keep it away from Volkov
750
01:20:30,475 --> 01:20:31,652
你就这么信他
Do you just trust him like that
751
01:20:32,795 --> 01:20:34,090
我还有别的选择吗
Do I have another option
752
01:20:34,415 --> 01:20:37,312
你本来有的 你不该把我卷进来
You had a choice You shouldn't have dragged me into this
753
01:20:37,395 --> 01:20:39,101
他们总会找到他的
They would have found him anyway
754
01:20:39,255 --> 01:20:40,550
你很清楚这一点 杰克
You know this well Jake
755
01:20:40,935 --> 01:20:43,772
我对奥古斯特的信任 比对沃尔科夫多一点
I trust August a little more than Volkov
756
01:20:43,855 --> 01:20:46,326
他们俩都是伪善的混蛋
They're both a bunch of hypocrites
757
01:20:48,195 --> 01:20:49,735
我信任你 达拉
I trusted you Dara
758
01:20:51,195 --> 01:20:54,784
对我来说 一切都结束了
For me everything is over
759
01:20:56,528 --> 01:21:03,535
但如果我们能阻止沃尔科夫 也许别人还有机会
But if we can stop Volkov maybe others will still have a chance
760
01:21:04,684 --> 01:21:08,096
要阻止他 得死多少人
How many people have to die to stop him
761
01:21:11,535 --> 01:21:12,535
杰克 等等
Jake wait
762
01:21:13,015 --> 01:21:16,255
留下来和我们一起战斗吧
Stay and fight with us
763
01:21:17,595 --> 01:21:20,595
你难道不明白 像沃尔科夫这样的人 最后总能赢吗
Don't you understand that people like Volkov always win in the end
764
01:21:21,095 --> 01:21:24,684
他们赢 而你们这些好人却不能 最后总能赢
They win but you good people can't They always win in the end
765
01:21:26,225 --> 01:21:27,225
杰克
Jake
766
01:21:27,845 --> 01:21:28,845
杰克
Jake
767
01:21:29,892 --> 01:21:30,892
杰克
Jake
768
01:22:32,765 --> 01:22:33,765
好
Ok
769
01:22:34,405 --> 01:22:35,065
好 听着
All right listen
770
01:22:35,305 --> 01:22:37,065
这条路通向加来
This road leads to Calais
771
01:22:37,691 --> 01:22:38,928
奥古斯特的人在那里
August has his team there
772
01:22:39,125 --> 01:22:42,052
他们在等着运走《蒙娜丽莎》
They are waiting to take the Mona Lisa away
773
01:22:42,471 --> 01:22:43,471
你明白了吗
Do you understand
774
01:22:43,925 --> 01:22:46,565
而且他把这事办得很好
And he handled this matter well
775
01:22:49,238 --> 01:22:50,533
好 祝你好运
All right good luck
776
01:22:57,925 --> 01:22:59,514
这不是你的战争 杰克
This isn't your war Jake
777
01:23:01,045 --> 01:23:02,365
这不是你的战争
This isn't your war
778
01:23:12,924 --> 01:23:14,395
被关押在这里的士兵
The soldier held here
779
01:23:20,148 --> 01:23:21,470
很可笑 对吧
It's ridiculous isn't it
780
01:23:22,805 --> 01:23:24,805
行动
Move out
781
01:23:29,220 --> 01:23:31,220
各就各位
Take your positions
782
01:24:23,312 --> 01:24:24,530
难道
Could it be
783
01:24:33,791 --> 01:24:34,791
全体注意
Attention everyone
784
01:24:35,045 --> 01:24:36,281
安全引爆器
Safety detonator
785
01:24:44,078 --> 01:24:45,318
很可笑 对吧
It's ridiculous isn't it
786
01:24:46,585 --> 01:24:48,913
我们像这世界的渣滓一样被关在牢笼里
We were locked in cages like the dregs of this world
787
01:24:48,996 --> 01:24:51,645
再也见不到光明
Never to see the light again
788
01:24:52,998 --> 01:24:55,218
但正是这光明将我们解放
But it was this very light that set us free
789
01:24:55,645 --> 01:24:58,116
现在我们自由了 我们统治他们的世界
Now we are free and we rule their world
790
01:24:59,544 --> 01:25:01,104
去加来
Let's go to Calais
791
01:25:01,605 --> 01:25:02,662
之后再抓其他人
We'll catch the others later
792
01:25:02,745 --> 01:25:03,745
行动
Move out
793
01:25:12,381 --> 01:25:13,441
前进
Forward
794
01:26:19,811 --> 01:26:20,811
达拉
Dara
795
01:26:27,661 --> 01:26:29,318
哦 达拉
Oh Dara
796
01:26:29,581 --> 01:26:30,581
达拉
Dara
797
01:26:30,768 --> 01:26:31,768
达拉
Dara
798
01:26:32,148 --> 01:26:33,148
我在这
I'm here
799
01:26:33,175 --> 01:26:34,251
稳住
Stay calm
800
01:26:36,686 --> 01:26:38,569
你说得对 这确实没意义
You were right this really makes no sense
801
01:26:39,611 --> 01:26:40,871
你没必要回来的
You didn't have to come back
802
01:26:43,445 --> 01:26:45,165
对不起 让你失望了
I'm sorry I disappointed you
803
01:26:46,084 --> 01:26:47,842
对不起 我不该插手
I'm sorry I shouldn't have interfered
804
01:26:47,925 --> 01:26:49,690
你从没牵扯过我
You never involved me
805
01:26:50,592 --> 01:26:52,004
是我自己要离开的
I chose to leave on my own
806
01:26:52,625 --> 01:26:54,214
但我们必须拿到那颗炸弹
But we have to get that bomb
807
01:26:54,951 --> 01:26:56,084
怎么拿
How
808
01:26:57,448 --> 01:27:00,442
你说过你能做一颗能炸毁马车的炸弹 对吧
You said you could make a bomb that destroys a carriage right
809
01:27:00,525 --> 01:27:01,643
那火车呢
What about a train
810
01:27:02,212 --> 01:27:03,212
杰克
Jake
811
01:27:03,485 --> 01:27:06,742
火车正往城里开 要到目的地必须过桥
The train is heading for the city and it has to cross the bridge to reach the destination
812
01:27:06,825 --> 01:27:09,697
我只需要拿到引爆器 不让火车停下
I just need to get the detonator and stop the train from halting
813
01:27:09,780 --> 01:27:11,657
而你去炸桥
And you go blow up the bridge
814
01:27:12,064 --> 01:27:13,064
难道
Could it be
815
01:27:15,815 --> 01:27:17,110
达拉 你必须这么做
Dara you have to do this
816
01:27:17,941 --> 01:27:20,647
但要做就得现在做
But if we're going to do it we have to do it now
817
01:27:21,095 --> 01:27:22,154
好 准备好了吗
All right are you ready
818
01:27:22,575 --> 01:27:23,575
准备好了 我们走
Ready let's go
819
01:27:24,308 --> 01:27:25,308
你能走吗
Can you walk
820
01:27:26,941 --> 01:27:27,941
能
Yes
821
01:27:32,105 --> 01:27:33,662
达拉 快走 走
Dara hurry up let's go
822
01:27:33,745 --> 01:27:34,745
好
All right
823
01:28:06,954 --> 01:28:08,285
快点 快点
Hurry up hurry up
824
01:28:51,334 --> 01:28:52,874
为什么这么晚 天这么黑
Why so late It's so dark
825
01:28:53,173 --> 01:28:55,850
能见度也差 我必须晚点走
Visibility is also poor I have to leave late
826
01:28:55,934 --> 01:28:58,851
等我们过桥开上直路 我来处理
When we cross the bridge and get on the straight road I'll take care of it
827
01:28:58,934 --> 01:29:00,391
他不会喜欢的
He won't like this
828
01:29:00,481 --> 01:29:01,641
我已经尽力了
I'm doing my best
829
01:29:02,749 --> 01:29:03,787
蠢货
Idiot
830
01:29:08,394 --> 01:29:10,853
我们机会不大
We have little chance
831
01:29:11,534 --> 01:29:13,794
我知道 我们必须阻止他
I know. We have to prevent this.
832
01:29:13,893 --> 01:29:14,893
对
Yes.
833
01:29:18,660 --> 01:29:19,331
该死
Damn.
834
01:29:19,414 --> 01:29:20,414
走
Go.
835
01:29:33,914 --> 01:29:35,211
到十字路口右转
Turn right at the intersection.
836
01:29:35,294 --> 01:29:36,127
好
Ok.
837
01:29:36,274 --> 01:29:37,274
关灯
Turn off the lights.
838
01:29:37,474 --> 01:29:38,474
好
Ok.
839
01:29:54,187 --> 01:29:55,187
好吧
Well;
840
01:29:55,659 --> 01:29:57,895
我担心能见度的问题
There is a concern about visibility.
841
01:29:57,994 --> 01:30:02,067
我觉得没必要担心
I don't see any reason for concern.
842
01:30:02,647 --> 01:30:05,471
但司机向我保证 他会尽全力
But the driver assured me that he is doing everything in his power.
843
01:30:05,562 --> 01:30:06,562
是吗
Really;
844
01:30:07,670 --> 01:30:09,710
我觉得他低估了自己
I think he underestimates himself.
845
01:30:09,794 --> 01:30:10,651
我觉得你说得对
I think you're right.
846
01:30:10,734 --> 01:30:14,617
我觉得他需要一点帮助 才能展现潜力
I think he needs a little help to show his potential.
847
01:30:15,134 --> 01:30:16,294
就像你一样
Just like you.
848
01:30:17,801 --> 01:30:18,801
将死
Checkmate.
849
01:30:20,633 --> 01:30:21,633
再说一遍
Again.
850
01:30:40,098 --> 01:30:44,584
我晚点走是因为 我们带着原子弹
I'm leaving late because we have an atomic bomb!
851
01:30:45,984 --> 01:30:47,573
就这样吗
Is that all?
852
01:30:50,724 --> 01:30:52,136
让我在桥上下车
Drop me off at the bridge.
853
01:30:58,016 --> 01:30:59,134
去桥上
Go to the bridge.
854
01:31:24,217 --> 01:31:25,217
那又怎样
So what?
855
01:31:25,284 --> 01:31:28,413
有些人需要一点推动力
Some people need a little push.
856
01:33:22,145 --> 01:33:23,930
也许你该去找他
Maybe you should go find him?
857
01:33:24,364 --> 01:33:26,659
他在 而且他在等你
He's here! And he's waiting for you.
858
01:34:33,727 --> 01:34:37,327
《蒙娜丽莎》对你来说可是块大肥肉
The Mona Lisa is a very big prize for you!
859
01:34:38,194 --> 01:34:39,724
我不是来拿它的
I didn't come for her.
860
01:34:39,834 --> 01:34:40,834
你是谁
Who are you?
861
01:34:41,136 --> 01:34:42,549
杀手吗
A killer?
862
01:34:42,874 --> 01:34:43,874
不是
No.
863
01:34:44,253 --> 01:34:45,548
我只是个诱饵
I'm just bait.
864
01:34:56,921 --> 01:34:57,921
胡子不错
Nice beard.
865
01:35:07,917 --> 01:35:08,917
该死
Damn!
866
01:35:21,404 --> 01:35:22,971
戏法不错
Nice trick.
867
01:35:32,125 --> 01:35:33,125
杰克
Jake.
868
01:35:36,053 --> 01:35:37,053
杰克
Jake!
869
01:35:54,460 --> 01:35:55,699
杰克
Jake!
870
01:36:02,404 --> 01:36:03,404
杰克
Jake!
871
01:36:05,244 --> 01:36:06,244
怎么了
What happened?
872
01:36:06,614 --> 01:36:07,374
你还好吗
Are you all right?
873
01:36:07,458 --> 01:36:08,635
我没事
Yes, I feel fine.
874
01:36:08,824 --> 01:36:09,344
你呢
And you?
875
01:36:09,428 --> 01:36:10,428
我也没事
I'm fine too.
876
01:36:11,103 --> 01:36:12,350
听到你没事我就放心了
I'm glad to hear that.
877
01:36:12,434 --> 01:36:13,434
怎么了
What?
878
01:36:15,794 --> 01:36:16,794
你看
Look.
879
01:36:16,994 --> 01:36:17,994
杰克
Jake!
880
01:36:29,437 --> 01:36:32,676
英国 萨里
Surrey - England
881
01:36:36,697 --> 01:36:37,599
天啊 杰克
Oh my God, Jake.
882
01:36:37,683 --> 01:36:41,281
你看起来就像刚和一群狼打过架
You look like you fought a pack of wolves.
883
01:36:41,365 --> 01:36:42,836
差不多吧
Yes, something like that.
884
01:36:44,284 --> 01:36:46,755
你那该死的《蒙娜丽莎》在峡谷底
Your damn Mona Lisa is at the bottom of the canyon.
885
01:36:47,663 --> 01:36:50,741
我不知道现在是什么情况 但没有引爆器它就不会炸
I don't know what the situation is but it can't explode without this.
887
01:36:52,705 --> 01:36:55,121
新的重大文化掠夺
a new major cultural plunder
888
01:36:55,204 --> 01:36:56,204
或许不是
Or maybe not
889
01:36:56,564 --> 01:36:58,861
我现在能休息了吗
Can I rest now
890
01:36:58,951 --> 01:37:00,231
不 不 杰克
No, no, Jake
891
01:37:00,504 --> 01:37:04,994
我无法想象会这么天真 认为没有其他沃尔科夫了
I can't imagine being so naive that there are no other Volkovs
