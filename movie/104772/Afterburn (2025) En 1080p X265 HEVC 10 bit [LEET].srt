16
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:34,158
Before the world ended, I could find anything or anyone, anywhere. Not to brag, but some called me the
world's greatest treasure hunter. There was nothing I couldn't find. I spent most of my time underwater,

17
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:42,150
finding things that had been lost for centuries. My work was solitary, researching and then setting
out all my missions. But I liked it that way. I controlled my own destiny with no one to report to.

18
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:48,209
But all that changed when the solar flared in. The world
was thrown into darkness and chaos. All modern electronics

19
00:00:48,221 --> 00:00:52,560
were fried. Most things didn't work anymore. People
thought the governments would take charge to fix things.

20
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:57,727
I wish we'd think.
Warlords seized control of

21
00:00:57,739 --> 00:01:00,160
local governments and
ruled large parts of Europe.

22
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:13,200
They thought everything was going
to be fine. I knew better, of course.

23
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:17,905
Starving cities turned into
graveyards. Money was useless.

24
00:01:17,917 --> 00:01:21,890
Medicine had fueled nowhere to
be found. And diseases spread.

25
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:28,806
I guess I was better equipped
for this. I was a survivor.

26
00:01:28,818 --> 00:01:32,550
And I was soon doing what
I always did. Finding things.

27
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:37,470
Except now the world was a
much more dangerous place.

28
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:28,496
Alright, the boys blue are back here.

29
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:31,600
Oh, mate. What you doing up here?

30
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:35,740
Wait a minute.
You guys aren't real cops, are you?

31
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:43,980
What's in the case?

32
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,580
I don't know. Violin, fiddle, you don't
really know the difference why you play.

33
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,120
Hand it up.

34
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,560
Yeah, you want this.

35
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,760
Better give me what you miss.

36
00:07:58,380 --> 00:07:59,960
Wash your mouth out with buckshot.

37
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:04,460
You want a beer to get us home.

38
00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:07,840
No, that's true. Just you.

39
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,920
And you. And you.

40
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:13,440
And you.

41
00:08:13,441 --> 00:08:14,441
And you.

42
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:16,760
And definitely you.

43
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:20,180
Get it, boys.

44
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,480
Yeah.

45
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:23,860
Yeah.

46
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:00,060
Check charge.

47
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:34,200
A little pause...

48
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:39,124
I might as well kill Fetchum or
Fiddler, his hand and his soul.

49
00:10:39,136 --> 00:10:40,840
No thanks. We'd all
work on the building.

50
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,400
He's willing to compensate you.

51
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:46,280
And it's a meeting.
And not if you're free in the boat.

52
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,080
Where's John?

53
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:51,960
Across the channel.

54
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:53,540
I'll... there's no business with him.

55
00:10:53,930 --> 00:10:57,360
Just think about it, Jay.
You've been a fresh start.

56
00:10:58,020 --> 00:11:00,820
If I wanted a fresh start, I would
shoot myself in the head to get it.

57
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:02,220
Yeah, we'll get you there safely.

58
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:05,240
There's nothing there but
disease and war and origin.

59
00:11:05,241 --> 00:11:08,620
He didn't get it. No thanks.
It was last year ago.

60
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,600
Jake!

61
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:12,660
You look amazing.

62
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,440
He's got a lot of soup.

63
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:26,940
He declined.

64
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,660
He'd rather walk on his boat.

65
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:34,780
You believe that?

66
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,600
It's a goddamn trap.

67
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,660
He doesn't make chicken off.

68
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:44,920
No, he can't.

69
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,320
Shariachi, you're favorite.

70
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:20,550
Good boy.

71
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:22,050
Good boy.

72
00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:23,910
You like that boy.

73
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:18,860
What are you doing here?

74
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:20,940
The King sent me.

75
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:24,120
He bought the job to home 101.

76
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:25,540
Get him yourself.

77
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:28,060
He's waiting for you in the wrecking yard.

78
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:37,930
Hey! Can you help me down?

79
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:08,760
Jay! Let me in. I'll see.

80
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:10,540
Sit down. Let's talk.

81
00:16:16,430 --> 00:16:20,100
So, how are you doing?

82
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:24,240
I employ dozens to do what you do.

83
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:29,040
You think you can be the only
one who finds things others can't.

84
00:16:29,041 --> 00:16:31,440
Is it a special skill?

85
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:33,040
Gifts?

86
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:34,780
I'm thinking of gifts.

87
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:35,920
The Stradivariots!

88
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,200
It's beyond the...

89
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,480
divine music.

90
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:43,860
Make a grown man cry.

91
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:46,545
Maybe you should start
with food and clean the

92
00:16:46,557 --> 00:16:48,536
water before you can
start building the symphony.

93
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,720
You think you're not working
on the food shortage yet?

94
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:53,740
So is the man with the mouth of a stick.

95
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:55,500
I'm a pescatarian.

96
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:00,120
You think fixing the shit's easy.

97
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:04,160
Not except for scatting my
fingers to turn the lights back on.

98
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:07,760
Whole fuckin' infrastructure is shocked.

99
00:17:08,530 --> 00:17:10,540
For busting our asses every day.

100
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,760
To rebuild these things on the ground.

101
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:15,980
Despite the efforts of people
trying to stop us flunging on Boha.

102
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:17,640
Right.

103
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:20,220
Don't you want no culture
to smudging your face?

104
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,040
It's an age of chaos.

105
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:26,180
You grab to see the world
burn and move the ashes.

106
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:28,900
And you see yourself differently.

107
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:30,500
Ho, ho, ho, ho.

108
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:32,660
Cinnocism.

109
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:34,340
Believe me, but I tell you, Jay.

110
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:36,920
This is not a job I want.

111
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:40,560
When the solar flare hits
the monster, you manage.

112
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:42,100
You saw what this is inside.

113
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:45,140
No one anticipates the world's first.

114
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,420
People manage them.

115
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:51,820
Some became barbarians.

116
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:54,260
Like you.

117
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:56,900
There's ivory towers
at your building, though.

118
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:58,980
And the barbarians are there, obviously.

119
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,380
Oh, everyone's managed
resourceful as you, I think.

120
00:18:02,381 --> 00:18:05,620
They don't have your
skills or grip to survive.

121
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:08,300
They need protection.

122
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:10,620
Without these walls,

123
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:12,560
more and more than this line.

124
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,516
What about the ones outside the wall?

125
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:15,620
What about the ones hiding?

126
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:16,540
You know, what, they're the two.

127
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:17,820
All of them will contain.

128
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,280
Even you.

129
00:18:28,530 --> 00:18:30,610
Mr. Pointchance tells me you're reluctant.

130
00:18:31,930 --> 00:18:32,930
Across the channel.

131
00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:36,090
No, I'm not reluctant.
I'm dead set against the wall.

132
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:38,890
Maybe that's because you
haven't seen the big picture.

133
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:42,370
I want to see the big picture.

134
00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:44,050
The big picture is ugly.

135
00:18:44,530 --> 00:18:44,870
It's cruel.

136
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:46,270
Uh-uh.

137
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:48,350
Not all of them.

138
00:18:48,890 --> 00:18:53,350
We are spending a lot of time storing
how we are looking at these people.

139
00:18:54,850 --> 00:18:56,150
You'll be a free man, Jay.

140
00:18:58,590 --> 00:18:59,590
Unencovered.

141
00:19:01,530 --> 00:19:02,570
Answerable to no man.

142
00:19:03,290 --> 00:19:04,450
All I need is a man.

143
00:19:05,390 --> 00:19:06,670
Fly away in the ocean.

144
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:13,400
The people and I want a whirlwind.

145
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,080
What would I be hunting to be this night?

146
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:17,500
Huh?

147
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:20,300
Mona.

148
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:24,550
Mona Lisa?

149
00:19:24,910 --> 00:19:25,910
In all of them.

150
00:19:29,030 --> 00:19:31,150
I hate to bring the bad news
to you and your majesty.

151
00:19:31,450 --> 00:19:33,890
But Paris was one of the
first cities to burn down.

152
00:19:33,891 --> 00:19:34,730
Mr. General.

153
00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:35,890
Mr. General.

154
00:19:36,790 --> 00:19:38,870
But here's something you may not know.

155
00:19:39,210 --> 00:19:43,181
It's that when the flare hit, the
French government evacuated

156
00:19:43,193 --> 00:19:46,850
all its national treasures
to a secret storage facility.

157
00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:51,910
Everything from fire and fire and
the president supports them as well.

158
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,580
How am I supposed to get there?

159
00:19:57,940 --> 00:20:00,160
The king is playing as
well by the king's power.

160
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:04,070
Then I get the ball.

161
00:20:05,010 --> 00:20:06,870
All the resources and food you need.

162
00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:09,610
Hell, I'll even give you a title.

163
00:20:10,850 --> 00:20:11,530
Okay.

164
00:20:11,770 --> 00:20:13,970
Well, if... What is the
minister of defense?

165
00:20:14,370 --> 00:20:15,591
That's... That's...

166
00:20:15,870 --> 00:20:19,510
If you're at the king,
what would you bring?

167
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,260
Motherfucker of cultural appropriation.

168
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:49,180
I'm sorry.

169
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:50,740
I'm sorry.

170
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:03,420
I'm sorry.

171
00:21:03,421 --> 00:21:03,780
I don't...

172
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:05,260
How are you?

173
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:06,720
How are you?

174
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:09,620
I think this is a really bad idea.

175
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,780
You always seem to come out on top.

176
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:13,537
Yeah, if I always come
out on top, I'm gonna

177
00:21:13,549 --> 00:21:14,936
wipe it my head into
the worst of myself.

178
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:21,211
I don't... I left one of your food
and water for some of them.

179
00:21:23,050 --> 00:21:24,950
But will you promise if I
don't make a bad decision?

180
00:21:24,951 --> 00:21:27,970
I can't.
There might be one else to ask you.

181
00:21:31,210 --> 00:21:33,390
I don't think it's worth
late to me very much.

182
00:21:35,330 --> 00:21:36,570
I'm not sure if they trust you.

183
00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:43,770
Try not to die.

184
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:48,150
I'm going to try and make it back a while.

185
00:21:48,690 --> 00:21:49,690
Always.

186
00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:40,390
Takes your breath away, don't she?

187
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:44,280
Yeah, she got rights for this one.

188
00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:48,590
Why not?

189
00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:50,630
Huh? Yeah.

190
00:22:51,570 --> 00:22:52,570
You got strings?

191
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:54,330
No, not technically.

192
00:22:54,510 --> 00:22:55,330
But you're a boyholder.

193
00:22:55,490 --> 00:22:56,490
Them?

194
00:22:56,730 --> 00:22:57,870
I had them from last week.

195
00:22:58,280 --> 00:22:59,480
Do a rendezvous with the boys.

196
00:23:00,270 --> 00:23:01,270
Oh.

197
00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:02,510
The king's waiting.

198
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:04,550
Don't be late.

199
00:23:08,930 --> 00:23:10,830
John, give me an undercover darkness.

200
00:23:11,270 --> 00:23:12,650
Now, your insertion point.

201
00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:15,370
Here, outside this small village.

202
00:23:15,810 --> 00:23:18,410
Now, according to the intel,
you can clear the rebels.

203
00:23:18,850 --> 00:23:22,830
Now, you'll hover the hood due north to St.
Quentin.

204
00:23:23,730 --> 00:23:25,150
That's a governmental occupation.

205
00:23:25,490 --> 00:23:26,990
So you gotta go in quietly.

206
00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:29,070
Like a whisper.

207
00:23:29,390 --> 00:23:31,410
Like a baby fucking mouse.

208
00:23:31,850 --> 00:23:34,690
Now, make your way to the city center.

209
00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:38,030
And our rebel liaison will beat you there.

210
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:44,240
See you soon.

211
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,340
It's a big fuckin' area.

212
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,600
I don't know how much respect you.

213
00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:05,080
Oh, I don't know how much respect you.

214
00:24:05,081 --> 00:24:07,680
You got hands armed on them.

215
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:08,000
Right.

216
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:11,280
And I'll drop the equipment
before an air temp evacuation.

217
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:12,820
Three hours later.

218
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:14,720
Three hours.

219
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:16,040
Good.

220
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:17,980
You know, the plane's got holes.

221
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:19,420
Never noticed.

222
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:21,860
Wheels up.

223
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:23,440
10 p.m.

224
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:25,020
I'm here.

225
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:33,180
Get up.

226
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:38,760
All right.

227
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:39,860
Four set, go.

228
00:24:43,270 --> 00:24:44,270
Uh.

229
00:24:45,670 --> 00:24:46,950
What, your seatbelts are broken?

230
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,150
Not worth the body, mate.

231
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:50,660
Stripping nylon's not gonna
help if she goes down, is it?

232
00:24:51,310 --> 00:24:51,770
All right.

233
00:24:52,230 --> 00:24:53,230
Here we go.

234
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:36,100
Is everything okay?

235
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:36,620
Yeah, yeah.

236
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,000
Uh, just doing some sums.

237
00:25:40,250 --> 00:25:42,090
Uh, I'm not sure that
gauge is working, right?

238
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:44,629
Uh, obviously with that,
all we're gonna have

239
00:25:44,641 --> 00:25:46,500
fuel halfway there,
so, uh, probably best

240
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:48,500
to probably parachute just in case.

241
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:49,740
Yeah.

242
00:26:00,925 --> 00:26:02,246
Uh, pull this off in the chute, right?

243
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:03,270
Well, well done.

244
00:26:03,950 --> 00:26:05,150
Have you not done this before?

245
00:26:06,030 --> 00:26:06,310
No.

246
00:26:06,830 --> 00:26:08,130
Oh, can you have a chance?

247
00:26:08,510 --> 00:26:09,510
Yes.

248
00:26:09,970 --> 00:26:11,130
That's the point you pull.

249
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:12,770
What do I pull?

250
00:26:12,890 --> 00:26:13,230
I don't know.

251
00:26:13,370 --> 00:26:14,890
Preferably, before you hit the ground.

252
00:26:16,390 --> 00:26:17,390
Relax.

253
00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:18,750
Have a tip or something.

254
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:21,520
I'll take us as a senior group, yeah?

255
00:26:23,310 --> 00:26:24,310
In a little bit.

256
00:26:48,790 --> 00:26:49,270
Yeah.

257
00:26:49,530 --> 00:26:50,770
You're looking for a big dream.

258
00:26:51,370 --> 00:26:52,130
One expat.

259
00:26:52,230 --> 00:26:52,670
You're looking for a big dream.

260
00:26:52,770 --> 00:26:53,190
Go.

261
00:26:53,191 --> 00:26:53,310
Go.

262
00:26:54,110 --> 00:26:55,110
Go.

263
00:26:55,350 --> 00:26:55,490
Go.

264
00:26:55,491 --> 00:26:55,590
Go.

265
00:26:55,830 --> 00:26:56,130
Go.

266
00:26:56,230 --> 00:26:56,410
Go.

267
00:26:56,550 --> 00:26:56,910
Go.

268
00:26:57,050 --> 00:26:58,050
Go.

269
00:26:58,210 --> 00:26:59,210
Go.

270
00:27:00,290 --> 00:27:00,770
Go.

271
00:27:00,771 --> 00:27:02,890
1 expat ki site paor jaae.

272
00:27:02,970 --> 00:27:03,970
Uh, Ohaly.

273
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:30,710
Go get rektat a bit.

274
00:27:31,290 --> 00:27:32,290
Yeah.

275
00:27:33,270 --> 00:27:33,330
Yeah.

276
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:36,010
Let me talk.

277
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:44,640
Yeah.

278
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:45,700
Yeah.

279
00:27:57,020 --> 00:27:57,560
Yeah.

280
00:27:57,561 --> 00:27:57,660
Yeah.

281
00:27:57,661 --> 00:28:00,860
Come on, Dan.
Well, as soon as I open it, yeah?

282
00:28:02,710 --> 00:28:04,030
Come on, now, this is a bad idea.

283
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:57,280
This is definitely a bad idea.

284
00:30:54,740 --> 00:30:56,940
Where is the opponent? It was hard to find.

285
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:01,900
This game taught me so many things.

286
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:07,580
The most important lesson is
the reveal of a strong adversary.

287
00:31:11,930 --> 00:31:14,130
You see, I learned how to
play when I was incarcerated.

288
00:31:15,050 --> 00:31:18,700
In prison, by design,
is a gladiatorial arena.

289
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:23,440
One challenge after another,
a persistent power struggle.

290
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:28,340
In the beginning, it was terrifying.

291
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:34,520
When I felt dressed, I discovered
something life-changing.

292
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:40,100
Playing against those who are
better than me, made me better.

293
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:42,460
And...

294
00:31:42,570 --> 00:31:45,020
I only sort of put the
rescue to the champions.

295
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:49,180
And that's why... I
demand from you...

296
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:51,700
Make...

297
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:53,661
Your... Best.

298
00:32:35,410 --> 00:32:36,410
Next.

299
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:45,960
Fireed on the plane an hour ago.

300
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:47,100
One client.

301
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,360
Single prompt.

302
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,400
Probably the ultimate.

303
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:50,580
One parachute.

304
00:32:54,270 --> 00:32:55,310
Word out.

305
00:32:55,670 --> 00:32:56,770
There began.

306
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:01,350
There's informed that they saw a thousand
bullets whether it finds our visitor.

307
00:33:01,351 --> 00:33:02,351
There.

308
00:33:02,570 --> 00:33:04,390
Let's get the train ready.

309
00:33:05,310 --> 00:33:12,520
Let's get the train ready.

310
00:33:12,521 --> 00:33:12,880
There it is.

311
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:14,240
30 dollars.

312
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:15,680
It's possible to get set quick.

313
00:34:53,710 --> 00:34:56,220
Trashers will be distributed
for loyal citizens at 1600 hours.

314
00:34:58,370 --> 00:35:00,340
Curfew will still be enforced.

315
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:09,500
Evading the rules of General Volkov will
result in immediate and severe punishment.

316
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:18,100
Control.

317
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:10,280
Dropped the bag.

318
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:44,100
Dropped the bag.

319
00:36:57,060 --> 00:36:58,320
Where is that man?

320
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:07,340
You're near my contact.

321
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:08,620
Bravo.

322
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:10,180
Do you have any... Stick?

323
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:11,720
Yeah.

324
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:13,100
But I get sick of that guy.

325
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:14,520
You're welcome.

326
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:15,920
You're here the whole time.

327
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:17,220
Why didn't you step in sooner?

328
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:20,056
Just needed to see if you
could handle what's ahead.

329
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:21,080
I heard myself.

330
00:37:21,580 --> 00:37:21,960
Andrea.

331
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:23,480
Follow me.

332
00:37:31,210 --> 00:37:32,210
Gross.

333
00:37:32,430 --> 00:37:33,746
Do you know that I cleaned up your vests?

334
00:37:33,770 --> 00:37:34,150
Get going.

335
00:37:34,350 --> 00:37:35,710
Don't come looking for these guys.

336
00:37:36,350 --> 00:37:38,436
What do you got to think
for cutting guys' throats out?

337
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:39,460
My father was a butcher.

338
00:37:39,790 --> 00:37:40,830
I want to keep this guy.

339
00:37:41,130 --> 00:37:42,130
It's nowhere at all.

340
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:43,510
Keep your eyes down.

341
00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:53,460
Get him.

342
00:39:46,750 --> 00:39:47,750
This is the guy.

343
00:39:47,890 --> 00:39:48,890
This is the guy.

344
00:39:48,950 --> 00:39:49,210
This is the guy.

345
00:39:49,950 --> 00:39:50,950
He's bleeding.

346
00:39:51,130 --> 00:39:52,250
We should take care of that.

347
00:39:52,930 --> 00:39:53,930
Welcome.

348
00:39:54,290 --> 00:39:55,570
Would you like something to eat?

349
00:39:55,690 --> 00:39:55,930
No.

350
00:39:56,470 --> 00:39:57,450
Something to drink, perhaps?

351
00:39:57,451 --> 00:39:58,170
No.

352
00:39:58,470 --> 00:39:58,730
No.

353
00:39:58,910 --> 00:39:59,190
Thank you.

354
00:39:59,330 --> 00:40:02,110
Father, with all due respect,
I just went into a war zone.

355
00:40:02,670 --> 00:40:04,390
Jumped out of the plane for the first time.

356
00:40:04,570 --> 00:40:05,770
Almost got clutched by a tank.

357
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:08,080
Got attacked by soldiers while she watched.

358
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:09,806
So, right now, I just want
to get to where I'm going.

359
00:40:09,830 --> 00:40:12,670
So, if you could just put me in
the right direction, I'll be on my way.

360
00:40:13,650 --> 00:40:15,150
Patience is a virtue, myself.

361
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:28,480
But you say that you're
living in the house, Greg?

362
00:40:49,340 --> 00:40:50,340
Wow.

363
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:53,240
Well, that's what I'm talking about.

364
00:40:54,380 --> 00:40:56,160
You have a 1,000 horsepower.

365
00:40:56,940 --> 00:40:57,960
But you don't do too.

366
00:40:58,600 --> 00:40:59,600
Nice.

367
00:41:04,490 --> 00:41:06,530
And then... Oh, yes, of course.

368
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:16,280
So, William?

369
00:41:16,281 --> 00:41:18,000
I don't know.

370
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:19,780
I don't know.

371
00:41:19,781 --> 00:41:20,781
Great territory.

372
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:22,620
And what did you get out?

373
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:24,380
What?

374
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:25,160
I don't know.

375
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:27,141
It's just... Bad luck.

376
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,580
What is that?

377
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:32,780
Well, it could be a cypher.

378
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:34,100
I'll buy the truck.

379
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,000
Is that your mom?

380
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:36,940
Yeah, sure.

381
00:41:37,420 --> 00:41:37,740
Bye.

382
00:41:38,340 --> 00:41:39,340
Come with me.

383
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:56,600
You like it?

384
00:41:59,860 --> 00:42:02,541
And we are... Oh.

385
00:42:03,620 --> 00:42:04,620
Yeah.

386
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:05,680
Yeah.

387
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:08,060
It's nice to see some beauty, you know.

388
00:42:12,270 --> 00:42:14,350
I think you're breathing
as good as August says.

389
00:42:15,230 --> 00:42:16,230
What's he say?

390
00:42:16,730 --> 00:42:18,630
Well, I hear his best.

391
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:25,920
Yeah, no, I'm not one of
August's prized possessions.

392
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:27,440
No?

393
00:42:27,540 --> 00:42:29,120
Well, August holds a lot of power.

394
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:30,580
Even all the way up again.

395
00:42:32,230 --> 00:42:33,580
This, I have nothing to remember.

396
00:42:34,220 --> 00:42:35,220
You ready?

397
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:35,760
Yeah.

398
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:37,220
Mm-hmm.

399
00:42:43,820 --> 00:42:45,820
Well, trust me, it's more real power.

400
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:48,920
Yeah.

401
00:42:48,921 --> 00:42:50,360
Well, then why are you here?

402
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:53,480
I'm asking myself the same question.

403
00:42:57,330 --> 00:42:59,510
And the other one else will
have something you want.

404
00:43:06,130 --> 00:43:07,130
Yeah, I do.

405
00:43:07,450 --> 00:43:08,630
Oh, man, just...

406
00:43:09,510 --> 00:43:11,750
Just here to make sure
you get from point A.

407
00:43:12,330 --> 00:43:13,330
Maybe.

408
00:43:18,250 --> 00:43:19,250
Let's go.

409
00:43:47,660 --> 00:43:50,040
I can't ever say how
important it is you get there first.

410
00:43:50,340 --> 00:43:51,340
You want to know this?

411
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:52,640
No.

412
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,720
We need to have our own paths to salvation.

413
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:56,680
Mine has to buy you both some time.

414
00:43:58,430 --> 00:44:00,940
And yours is to have faith in your courage.

415
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:03,460
Now, the office is all locked out.

416
00:44:04,220 --> 00:44:05,580
Hockup has a tank on every corner.

417
00:44:06,260 --> 00:44:09,140
We need to get through the old
factory and reach the Eastern Road.

418
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:16,480
Keep it.

419
00:44:33,150 --> 00:44:41,150
I'll wait to see what comes next.

420
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:57,440
What do you think, Jethro?

421
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:01,080
The rock goes so dead.

422
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:02,400
You know who you are.

423
00:45:03,020 --> 00:45:04,380
You know what goes on here.

424
00:45:05,220 --> 00:45:07,040
You can't hide anymore, please.

425
00:45:08,620 --> 00:45:09,620
You have nothing to hide.

426
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:12,040
God's you, Lord.

427
00:45:12,460 --> 00:45:13,460
Where are the others?

428
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:14,880
Others?

429
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:16,400
There's no one else.

430
00:45:16,700 --> 00:45:17,700
Just me.

431
00:45:30,460 --> 00:45:32,700
The only thing they'll find
in there is the Lord's work.

432
00:45:34,350 --> 00:45:36,720
The church is closed right now, but...

433
00:45:37,270 --> 00:45:39,800
You're welcome to come here,
if you wish to confess your sins.

434
00:45:39,801 --> 00:45:40,801
Ah.

435
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:42,360
How many years?

436
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:44,160
Oh, no.

437
00:45:44,340 --> 00:45:45,420
Is it just as well?

438
00:45:48,110 --> 00:45:51,220
Because absolution requires a moral
conscience and a yearning to be better.

439
00:45:51,780 --> 00:45:54,780
Qualities which you clearly cannot possess.

440
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:02,400
Because you, the heart of the darkness
on the face of this world of suffering.

441
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:06,400
And you will not prevail.

442
00:46:11,190 --> 00:46:12,570
What do they do now?

443
00:46:13,790 --> 00:46:14,790
They have these again.

444
00:46:17,190 --> 00:46:18,190
Don't move!

445
00:46:20,690 --> 00:46:21,690
Get out of the vehicle!

446
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:24,930
I want to quote Revelations 357.

447
00:46:49,530 --> 00:46:50,330
I want to quote General Klronic.

448
00:46:50,331 --> 00:46:52,100
It's theよろしく, not much
to quoteucharist, but

449
00:46:52,112 --> 00:46:53,771
it will never have a
questionasz blatant.

450
00:46:59,550 --> 00:47:03,350
I've read the piece tried out of them.

451
00:47:06,820 --> 00:47:09,391
The beautiful lâng the
Regiment inorr azuzel będzie!!!

452
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:17,440
And this is what she said, and
this渡込 takes a few years often.

453
00:47:17,441 --> 00:47:17,940
I don't know if bearing on that.

454
00:47:17,941 --> 00:47:20,780
You are sc5000 Sadhguru,
you don't know what it is.

455
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:55,140
We can't get around it.
Nope. We're going over it.

456
00:48:07,130 --> 00:48:08,590
It is bulletproof.

457
00:48:33,980 --> 00:48:40,380
On the drive! On the drive! On the drive!

458
00:48:41,120 --> 00:48:42,120
On the drive!

459
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:51,780
Oh, shit!

460
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:53,780
Oh, no, no, no, no!

461
00:48:54,520 --> 00:48:59,540
On the drive! On the drive!

462
00:49:08,930 --> 00:49:16,880
On the drive! On the drive!

463
00:49:17,030 --> 00:49:18,430
How many trains does this guy have?

464
00:49:22,620 --> 00:49:23,620
Jake! Oh, shit!

465
00:49:24,070 --> 00:49:25,070
Oh, my God!

466
00:49:43,620 --> 00:49:44,620
Roll over it.

467
00:50:04,740 --> 00:50:06,060
We're all right! We're all right!

468
00:50:06,170 --> 00:50:07,170
Not worried about them!

469
00:50:09,310 --> 00:50:10,310
Not worried about that!

470
00:51:05,390 --> 00:51:06,390
Fuckin' August!

471
00:51:07,970 --> 00:51:09,090
What the fuck are you doing?

472
00:51:09,170 --> 00:51:10,630
That motherfuckin' mother Lisa!

473
00:51:10,860 --> 00:51:12,300
And all this clown on fucking floor!

474
00:51:12,530 --> 00:51:14,630
And making a motherfuckin' appropriation!

475
00:51:14,990 --> 00:51:15,990
Fuck you!

476
00:51:16,050 --> 00:51:16,450
Oh yeah!

477
00:51:16,730 --> 00:51:17,730
Heave my ass!

478
00:51:39,210 --> 00:51:40,350
Thank you very much.

479
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:53,520
Thank you very much. You can see me
on the next stage. Thank you very much.

480
00:51:54,040 --> 00:51:55,040
May I need rest.

481
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:06,600
Hey, I got a question for you.

482
00:52:07,080 --> 00:52:08,080
Sure.

483
00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:10,780
What the fuck is going on that
you guys are also wounded?

484
00:52:12,920 --> 00:52:13,920
Okay, sir.

485
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:16,360
You give me a favor if you know it, right?

486
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:17,960
Good.

487
00:52:18,900 --> 00:52:19,920
Beautiful work of art.

488
00:52:20,620 --> 00:52:21,620
Almost a little more.

489
00:52:22,660 --> 00:52:23,660
Wow.

490
00:52:23,900 --> 00:52:27,400
Some people like paintings,
some like experiment.

491
00:52:41,270 --> 00:52:42,270
I'm near Father Sam.

492
00:53:07,050 --> 00:53:07,650
Volkov.

493
00:53:08,050 --> 00:53:09,590
He's searching for Volkov.

494
00:53:10,010 --> 00:53:11,410
And if he gets there, he works.

495
00:53:11,610 --> 00:53:12,610
He gets everything.

496
00:53:13,970 --> 00:53:16,270
They put a lot more than art in them.

497
00:53:17,170 --> 00:53:18,170
Food supplies.

498
00:53:19,770 --> 00:53:20,770
Weapons.

499
00:53:22,090 --> 00:53:23,290
And that's why...

500
00:53:25,270 --> 00:53:26,270
I guess, yeah.

501
00:53:30,920 --> 00:53:32,960
So, if we beat him to it,
you get your weapons.

502
00:53:33,420 --> 00:53:34,620
I'm just going to obtain them.

503
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:35,800
And...

504
00:53:35,940 --> 00:53:36,940
I get them both.

505
00:53:54,980 --> 00:53:55,340
Thank you.

506
00:53:55,780 --> 00:53:57,520
Thank you.

507
00:53:58,060 --> 00:53:58,420
Thank you.

508
00:53:58,421 --> 00:53:59,421
I love it this time.

509
00:53:59,720 --> 00:54:01,120
How many of us are left with you?

510
00:54:01,300 --> 00:54:02,440
Thank you.

511
00:54:05,630 --> 00:54:05,830
Thank you.

512
00:54:06,550 --> 00:54:08,186
My grandma taught me how to make origami.

513
00:54:08,210 --> 00:54:10,910
We used to make tons of them
and leave them for others to find me.

514
00:54:11,950 --> 00:54:14,730
I also know how to build a
bomb big enough to take out of it.

515
00:54:18,130 --> 00:54:19,130
Well...

516
00:54:19,310 --> 00:54:21,111
Well... Well...
That's pretty well.

517
00:54:21,290 --> 00:54:22,810
So many worries for me stating us.

518
00:54:23,630 --> 00:54:24,630
Yep.

519
00:54:24,850 --> 00:54:25,850
All right.

520
00:54:25,910 --> 00:54:26,910
Let's get going.

521
00:55:35,460 --> 00:55:36,460
We're outnumbered, sir.

522
00:55:37,880 --> 00:55:38,880
Outnumbered in our grand.

523
00:55:39,270 --> 00:55:40,490
My lord Kreese.

524
00:55:42,090 --> 00:55:43,810
Some fucking feet like that.

525
00:55:44,070 --> 00:55:45,070
I remember.

526
00:55:47,570 --> 00:55:48,570
There were others, sir.

527
00:55:49,570 --> 00:55:50,570
And many?

528
00:55:52,830 --> 00:55:53,830
Ten.

529
00:55:54,290 --> 00:55:56,130
And they had a big fucking truck.

530
00:55:57,170 --> 00:55:58,730
A flying fucking truck.

531
00:55:59,510 --> 00:56:02,850
And you'd only have a ten and twenty men.

532
00:56:03,050 --> 00:56:04,370
He took his place and place, sir.

533
00:56:04,590 --> 00:56:05,890
He came out of nowhere.

534
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:07,690
A big bastard.

535
00:56:07,950 --> 00:56:08,950
And a girl.

536
00:56:09,710 --> 00:56:10,810
In a truck.

537
00:56:19,990 --> 00:56:20,990
Anything else?

538
00:56:24,310 --> 00:56:25,310
You know the priest.

539
00:56:26,910 --> 00:56:29,070
Sir, I can still be of service, dear sir.

540
00:56:29,740 --> 00:56:30,780
You don't need to kill me.

541
00:56:32,730 --> 00:56:34,010
Well, I'm not going to kill you.

542
00:56:37,630 --> 00:56:38,630
No.

543
00:56:40,710 --> 00:56:42,030
I've got all that form of it.

544
00:56:42,230 --> 00:56:43,230
That's right open.

545
00:56:44,150 --> 00:56:44,770
Well, fun.

546
00:56:44,890 --> 00:56:45,890
These guys seem to know.

547
00:56:45,970 --> 00:56:46,970
I know.

548
00:56:48,290 --> 00:56:49,290
I know.

549
00:57:50,240 --> 00:57:51,760
They feel aware that we're in pay.

550
00:57:51,820 --> 00:57:52,820
So the maximum security.

551
00:57:53,940 --> 00:57:55,140
The cannibals, you understand?

552
00:57:55,740 --> 00:57:58,060
These guys, they eat what they kill.

553
00:57:58,980 --> 00:58:00,300
So let's get in and out.

554
00:58:00,520 --> 00:58:01,600
The good thing is possible.

555
00:58:07,720 --> 00:58:08,880
Of someone else's area.

556
00:58:10,360 --> 00:58:11,360
Come on.

557
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:05,240
We're too late.

558
00:59:17,690 --> 00:59:19,450
Not on store when blown up recently.

559
00:59:22,470 --> 00:59:23,470
A bullet off.

560
00:59:23,670 --> 00:59:24,670
A little damage.

561
00:59:25,270 --> 00:59:26,890
They look like they tried to defend it.

562
00:59:28,750 --> 00:59:30,360
Those captains, if
they got anything out of

563
00:59:30,384 --> 00:59:32,130
here, it moves it to a
more secure location.

564
00:59:32,810 --> 00:59:33,810
Where'd you get that map?

565
00:59:34,310 --> 00:59:36,150
The base commander's apartment in Paris.

566
00:59:36,670 --> 00:59:37,790
General Stéphane McToby.

567
00:59:38,310 --> 00:59:39,310
Let's look around it.

568
01:00:06,380 --> 01:00:07,540
Looks like they held up here.

569
01:00:24,820 --> 01:00:25,820
Stéphane McToby.

570
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:41,900
What?

571
01:00:42,060 --> 01:00:44,516
They evacuated the base commander
would have kept the record of it.

572
01:00:44,540 --> 01:00:45,540
Yeah.

573
01:01:46,010 --> 01:01:47,010
That's good point.

574
01:01:47,690 --> 01:01:50,130
Brings the massing fire for the rich line.

575
01:01:50,410 --> 01:01:50,790
They're coming.

576
01:01:51,330 --> 01:01:53,830
Back in all the valuables.

577
01:01:54,110 --> 01:01:54,230
Two.

578
01:01:54,970 --> 01:01:55,970
48 degrees.

579
01:01:57,230 --> 01:01:57,550
Baby.

580
01:01:58,050 --> 01:01:58,310
48.

581
01:01:58,930 --> 01:01:59,370
Five.

582
01:01:59,870 --> 01:02:00,870
Beautiful.

583
01:02:01,510 --> 01:02:03,970
Do you think they might be a square footer?

584
01:02:04,190 --> 01:02:05,190
No way.

585
01:02:05,570 --> 01:02:06,570
Not sure.

586
01:02:06,790 --> 01:02:07,790
It's way too convenient.

587
01:02:08,170 --> 01:02:08,530
No way.

588
01:02:08,630 --> 01:02:11,090
You just left the ship for
anybody to find us in the store.

589
01:02:11,550 --> 01:02:12,050
You think?

590
01:02:12,450 --> 01:02:14,810
Yeah, definitely wouldn't come with this.

591
01:02:15,710 --> 01:02:16,830
Yeah, what would you do now?

592
01:02:17,150 --> 01:02:18,150
Ok.

593
01:02:18,710 --> 01:02:19,710
Oh.

594
01:02:19,770 --> 01:02:20,410
Come on.

595
01:02:20,411 --> 01:02:21,411
It's coming up.

596
01:02:40,920 --> 01:02:46,380
Read me, of course, Brennan Brothers,
and water starting with the last two.

597
01:02:49,840 --> 01:02:51,520
Okay, ready? 28, 34, 58, 05, 57, 35.

598
01:02:54,930 --> 01:02:56,890
I'm sure. Is that anything?

599
01:02:57,450 --> 01:02:58,450
No.

600
01:03:00,940 --> 01:03:02,210
Great to see the thing here.

601
01:03:03,830 --> 01:03:04,830
Okay.

602
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:10,710
Come on, come on. We have to hurry up.

603
01:03:11,310 --> 01:03:12,310
We're in a minute.

604
01:03:13,370 --> 01:03:14,370
We need to go.

605
01:03:17,650 --> 01:03:18,690
Since you're home.

606
01:03:19,580 --> 01:03:20,620
Why don't you seem so bad?

607
01:03:20,950 --> 01:03:22,470
That's the fourth of the magical life.

608
01:03:24,630 --> 01:03:25,630
Somewhere.

609
01:03:25,990 --> 01:03:26,350
Voilà.

610
01:03:26,970 --> 01:03:27,970
Since you're home.

611
01:03:28,210 --> 01:03:29,210
Let's move.

612
01:03:29,870 --> 01:03:30,870
Let's go.

613
01:03:36,080 --> 01:03:37,240
Billy, gotta go.

614
01:04:16,140 --> 01:04:20,040
2, this is 1 on 1.

615
01:04:20,310 --> 01:04:21,680
1 on 2, do you read me?

616
01:04:21,681 --> 01:04:24,020
Go for Moularn 2.

617
01:04:25,890 --> 01:04:28,640
La wennürung's location
is Ouvrage du sincerof.

618
01:04:28,900 --> 01:04:29,900
I repeat.

619
01:04:30,380 --> 01:04:33,900
La wennürung's location
is Обrage du sincerof.

620
01:04:35,220 --> 01:04:38,793
Copy Mula 1. We can have a
steam at Simpsa Hoth by 1400 hours.

621
01:04:38,805 --> 01:04:42,100
Repeat. We can have a steam
at Simpsa Hoth by 1400 hours.

622
01:04:44,460 --> 01:04:46,660
Copy Mula 2. Mula 1 out.

623
01:05:17,930 --> 01:05:18,930
Let's go! Let's go!

624
01:06:35,490 --> 01:06:39,352
One truck, my ass. We're
going to Simpsa Hoth.

625
01:06:39,364 --> 01:06:43,490
And we're going to need
a very special magnitude.

626
01:06:44,850 --> 01:06:47,650
Tell the conductor we take in
the room in the fridge. Understood.

627
01:06:50,950 --> 01:06:54,670
But I think he wants his reward. A dozen
bullets. How many do you think he deserves?

628
01:06:55,570 --> 01:06:57,050
Three. Agree.

629
01:09:58,850 --> 01:10:00,030
System de convivere.

630
01:10:09,790 --> 01:10:11,230
Watch to get the heart of the sword.

631
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:25,460
I'll see you next time.

632
01:10:25,480 --> 01:10:26,480
One.

633
01:10:26,920 --> 01:10:28,000
One.

634
01:10:32,110 --> 01:10:33,110
Two.

635
01:10:34,220 --> 01:10:35,220
One.

636
01:10:35,560 --> 01:10:36,560
Two.

637
01:10:38,860 --> 01:10:39,940
One.

638
01:10:40,520 --> 01:10:41,600
One.

639
01:10:41,601 --> 01:10:47,060
I wish, uh, the wall is there and talked.
And that should... take her into the vault.

640
01:10:48,520 --> 01:10:49,520
Okay.

641
01:10:49,640 --> 01:10:51,720
This man's out there,
so we can have to kill her.

642
01:10:52,620 --> 01:10:53,620
And that one?

643
01:10:55,580 --> 01:10:56,580
It's figured out.

644
01:11:03,260 --> 01:11:05,420
Hey, remember that service road we saw?

645
01:11:06,400 --> 01:11:08,000
I bet that piece was on the balance.

646
01:11:09,480 --> 01:11:10,480
I'll take them out.

647
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:12,240
All right, let's see. You know what?

648
01:15:47,470 --> 01:15:48,470
Girl.

649
01:17:37,730 --> 01:17:39,000
Oh, oh, oh.

650
01:19:01,170 --> 01:19:03,010
August said you would
have helped if you knew.

651
01:19:03,550 --> 01:19:04,550
Goddamn right.

652
01:19:07,570 --> 01:19:09,570
The U.S.
made two atomic bombs dropped from Japan.

653
01:19:10,330 --> 01:19:14,610
Man and little boy, but there was
a threat set aside from Moscow.

654
01:19:15,610 --> 01:19:17,870
In case the Red Army
doesn't stop in Montreal,

655
01:19:20,910 --> 01:19:25,225
This bomb was meant to travel the wrong
way, so there was a safety measure added.

656
01:19:25,237 --> 01:19:27,930
Without this poor incentive,
this bomb can go off.

657
01:19:28,170 --> 01:19:31,017
So August gets the bomb and you
get everything else? August doesn't

658
01:19:31,029 --> 01:19:33,930
want this bomb to use it. He just
wants to give it away from Volkov.

659
01:19:38,390 --> 01:19:40,120
And you believe him?
What choice do I have?

660
01:19:40,132 --> 01:19:42,190
You had a choice. You
could have kept me out of it.

661
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:45,008
I have worked and found
it. And you know it, Jake.

662
01:19:45,020 --> 01:19:47,320
I do trust August just a
little more than I trust Volkov.

663
01:19:48,070 --> 01:19:52,750
They're both a part of the same hypocrisy.
I trusted you, Drea.

664
01:19:56,260 --> 01:20:02,170
Look, it might be too late for me
and the life I want. But maybe just...

665
01:20:02,790 --> 01:20:06,870
by stopping Volkov, I wonder
I'm gonna have that chance.

666
01:20:07,890 --> 01:20:10,050
And I may have to die when
you're trying to stop them.

667
01:20:14,710 --> 01:20:18,780
Jake, wait! Come on. Just stay in private.

668
01:20:20,380 --> 01:20:22,800
Don't you see the Volkovs of this world?
They went.

669
01:20:23,620 --> 01:20:25,120
We're good people to not drink.

670
01:20:25,860 --> 01:20:26,860
They went anyway.

671
01:20:30,740 --> 01:20:32,780
Jake! Jake! Jake!

672
01:21:37,850 --> 01:21:40,460
Stop, look at this.
This road leads to Carnegie.

673
01:21:41,140 --> 01:21:43,218
All of us has a team
there. And they'll be waiting

674
01:21:43,230 --> 01:21:45,320
to transport them all of
these across the channel.

675
01:21:46,270 --> 01:21:50,100
You got it? Now this, keep it very safe.

676
01:21:52,580 --> 01:21:53,760
Take the blood, guys.

677
01:22:01,590 --> 01:22:02,750
Not your fight, Jake.

678
01:23:52,370 --> 01:23:57,340
They looked up in cages like the scum
of the world, never to see the light again.

679
01:23:59,650 --> 01:24:02,600
But then the light liberated us.
And now we are moved.

680
01:24:03,360 --> 01:24:04,360
Let it walk.

681
01:24:05,800 --> 01:24:07,040
We've got a stick of the light.

682
01:24:07,780 --> 01:24:08,420
We've got a stick of the light.

683
01:24:08,580 --> 01:24:09,580
Let's move!

684
01:24:15,200 --> 01:24:15,520
Let's move!

685
01:24:15,680 --> 01:24:16,680
Let's move!

686
01:24:18,580 --> 01:24:19,580
I'm down!

687
01:26:13,230 --> 01:26:19,695
Sorry I dragged you into this. You didn't drive me into anything. You dragged me out. But we gotta
get that bomb back. You said you could build a bomb big enough to blow up a tank, right? What about

688
01:26:19,707 --> 01:26:26,216
a train? Train's headed back to the sea to get there. It's gotta cross the bridge. All I need to do
is get that plug and make sure the train doesn't stop. You just gotta blow that bridge. That's all.

689
01:26:26,240 --> 01:26:33,320
Let's get into it.
We'll get into it now. You won't.

690
01:27:07,580 --> 01:27:15,580
Hey, uh, fire it up.
We'll be right back. Go, go, go!

691
01:27:20,130 --> 01:27:21,250
What were you trying to say?

692
01:27:58,060 --> 01:28:01,920
Why are we going so slow? It's not the
door visibility. I have to make it slow.

693
01:28:01,921 --> 01:28:05,281
Once we're on the straightaway path of the
bridge, I'll be able to pick up the face.

694
01:28:05,340 --> 01:28:06,340
It's not gonna like that.

695
01:28:06,990 --> 01:28:07,990
I'm doing my best!

696
01:28:14,720 --> 01:28:16,600
We're gonna have a
small window of opportunity.

697
01:28:17,700 --> 01:28:19,820
I know. We gotta get ahead of him.

698
01:28:20,140 --> 01:28:21,140
Here.

699
01:28:24,930 --> 01:28:25,930
There it is.

700
01:28:40,100 --> 01:28:41,100
You're right at the fork.

701
01:28:41,620 --> 01:28:42,620
Kill the lights.

702
01:29:01,710 --> 01:29:03,296
There is concern that
he's not in the script.

703
01:29:03,320 --> 01:29:06,220
Oh, I don't remember hearing
the order for the concern.

704
01:29:06,480 --> 01:29:07,480
You did not.

705
01:29:08,170 --> 01:29:10,280
But the conductor assures
me he's doing this better.

706
01:29:10,800 --> 01:29:11,800
It's best, huh?

707
01:29:12,990 --> 01:29:14,400
I think he understands it.

708
01:29:14,620 --> 01:29:15,480
I think you're right.

709
01:29:15,640 --> 01:29:15,860
I think you're right.

710
01:29:15,861 --> 01:29:18,440
I think he just needs some
help to fulfill his potential.

711
01:29:19,060 --> 01:29:19,520
Indeed.

712
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:21,000
Just like you.

713
01:29:22,700 --> 01:29:23,700
Checkmate.

714
01:29:44,090 --> 01:29:45,330
You could take a hand.

715
01:29:45,975 --> 01:29:48,790
I'm going slow, because
we're carrying an atomic!

716
01:29:50,500 --> 01:29:51,710
That's your full potential.

717
01:29:55,330 --> 01:29:56,330
I'm here to over that.

718
01:30:01,750 --> 01:30:03,010
Get to that bridge.

719
01:30:28,250 --> 01:30:31,870
So, some people just need a little push.

720
01:32:28,790 --> 01:32:30,620
There she is! It's in that boy!

721
01:32:30,621 --> 01:32:31,621
Come on!

722
01:32:57,740 --> 01:33:03,590
My Lisa!

723
01:33:39,520 --> 01:33:42,860
My Lisa is out of your head!

724
01:33:44,410 --> 01:33:45,530
I'm not here for the bottom.

725
01:33:45,800 --> 01:33:47,880
Who is the assassin?

726
01:33:49,980 --> 01:33:50,980
I'm the distraction.

727
01:34:02,420 --> 01:34:03,680
Nice beard.

728
01:34:06,800 --> 01:34:08,720
Let me...

729
01:34:08,870 --> 01:34:14,060
How are you?

730
01:34:26,740 --> 01:34:28,860
It took me.

731
01:35:12,850 --> 01:35:14,240
What's wrong? Are you okay?

732
01:35:14,380 --> 01:35:15,380
No, I'm okay.

733
01:35:18,620 --> 01:35:19,520
I got one.

734
01:35:19,521 --> 01:35:19,680
I got one.

735
01:35:19,780 --> 01:35:20,780
I got one.

736
01:35:27,940 --> 01:35:28,940
What the...

737
01:35:43,580 --> 01:35:44,580
Jesus, Jake.

738
01:35:44,620 --> 01:35:46,470
You look like you've
been chewed up, digested,

739
01:35:46,482 --> 01:35:48,060
and shit out by the
wolves, didn't you?

740
01:35:48,160 --> 01:35:49,180
Yeah, sounds about right.

741
01:35:50,740 --> 01:35:53,060
Your fucking Mona Lisa is
at the bottom of the garage.

742
01:35:54,280 --> 01:35:57,256
You don't care to see yourself, but
you can't take that date or nothing else.

743
01:35:57,280 --> 01:35:57,980
Well, how'd that happen?

744
01:35:58,270 --> 01:36:01,140
Sounds like I gotta find me a new
motherfucking coach on the four grades.

745
01:36:01,141 --> 01:36:02,141
Well, no.

746
01:36:02,840 --> 01:36:05,080
I can just... I'm
gonna rest in peace.

747
01:36:05,480 --> 01:36:06,480
No, no.

748
01:36:06,760 --> 01:36:10,300
You're not naive enough to believe
there's no more vote calls in the world.

749
01:36:11,320 --> 01:36:12,320
No.

750
01:36:12,800 --> 01:36:14,400
Then I just hope you're not one of them.

751
01:36:18,240 --> 01:36:20,560
Now, I guess it's time
for you to sail away, Jake.

752
01:36:28,420 --> 01:36:29,480
Enjoy your little boat.

753
01:36:31,240 --> 01:36:33,120
I gotta build me a key from the rules.

754
01:36:33,121 --> 01:36:33,220
you know what it's going to do?

755
01:36:33,221 --> 01:36:33,280
You are a little busy.

756
01:36:33,540 --> 01:36:34,580
What it's going to do now?
