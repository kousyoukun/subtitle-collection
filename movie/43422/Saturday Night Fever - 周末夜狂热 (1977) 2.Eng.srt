1
00:01:56,366 --> 00:01:58,116
Hiya, Tony. Two or three?

2
00:01:58,201 --> 00:02:00,661
Two. Two. Give me two. That's good.

3
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:54,300
Hey, you guys do layaway?

4
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:56,724
As long as it don't turn into
a 20-year mortgage.

5
00:02:56,801 --> 00:03:00,801
All right, look, put me down for $5
for that blue shirt in the window.

6
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:03,560
-Hold it for me.
-Hey, wait for your receipt.

7
00:03:03,641 --> 00:03:06,441
-I trust you.
-Please don't. Don't trust me.

8
00:03:57,028 --> 00:03:58,648
-What did he charge you?
-$7.98.

9
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:00,408
That bastard.
Wait till he runs out of something.

10
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:02,070
Listen, you know what to tell her.

11
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:04,408
Excuse me, ma'am, I gotta get by.

12
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:05,834
-Got a second?
-Just a minute.

13
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:08,002
Look what I got for you,
Carnival, gold, just like you wanted.

14
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:10,171
Where have you been?
I've been here for a half hour.

15
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,330
That's all right. Look, I'm gonna
make you a deal on this paint.

16
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:13,918
-I'm very angry with you.
-That's all right.

17
00:04:14,003 --> 00:04:17,133
Look, I'm gonna make you
a nice deal on this. $1 off for you.

18
00:04:17,215 --> 00:04:19,965
$10.98 on this special gold paint.

19
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:21,801
-How you like that?
-Thank you.

20
00:04:21,886 --> 00:04:23,546
-I'll take a gallon of this.
-All right.

21
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,560
You got it. Heads up.

22
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:29,354
That's all right.

23
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:32,558
Customers like that,
it gives them a sense of power.

24
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:34,769
I need some brushes.

25
00:04:34,857 --> 00:04:36,897
All right, how much painting
you planning to do?

26
00:04:36,985 --> 00:04:40,445
After these two rooms,
I wouldn't paint my wife's ass purple.

27
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:42,200
What colour is it now?

28
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:44,032
You wanna know
what colour my wife's ass is?

29
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:45,907
You brung it up.

30
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:50,414
Actually, it ain't got no colour,
just stripes, them stretch stripes.

31
00:04:50,498 --> 00:04:51,868
What about them brushes?

32
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:55,378
Right. See that second display counter?
Over there.

33
00:05:01,884 --> 00:05:05,684
-Hey, Mr Fusco, can I get an advance?
-Payday's Monday.

34
00:05:05,763 --> 00:05:07,603
I know payday is Monday,

35
00:05:07,682 --> 00:05:09,812
but every place else
is Friday or Saturday.

36
00:05:09,892 --> 00:05:11,482
And they're broke on Monday.

37
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:13,561
-Boozing, whoring...
-Oh, come off it.

38
00:05:13,646 --> 00:05:15,726
Pissing away their money all weekend.

39
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:18,775
This way, you're paid on a Monday,
you got money all week.

40
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:22,450
-You can save a little, build a future.
-Oh, fuck the future.

41
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:28,080
No, Tony, you can't fuck the future,
the future fucks you.

42
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:32,371
It catches up with you, and it fucks you
if you ain't planned for it.

43
00:05:32,457 --> 00:05:35,077
Look, tonight is the future,
and I am planning for it.

44
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:37,038
There's a shirt I gotta buy,
a beautiful shirt. Blue...

45
00:05:37,128 --> 00:05:39,378
Sorry, Tony, no exceptions.

46
00:05:41,799 --> 00:05:44,299
Just wait till you need an advance,
all right?

47
00:05:44,385 --> 00:05:45,715
Big shot.

48
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:49,431
Hey, come on.

49
00:05:53,394 --> 00:05:54,904
Thanks, Tony.

50
00:06:08,701 --> 00:06:10,331
Where you been?

51
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:15,460
Your mother wants to know
where you been.

52
00:06:17,585 --> 00:06:19,245
Where you been?

53
00:06:19,337 --> 00:06:22,257
Your father's asking you!
Where you been?

54
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:25,550
Dinner's gonna be late tonight,
they was out of things at the market.

55
00:06:25,635 --> 00:06:27,635
But you'd have been late
if it was normal.

56
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,430
-Hey, Tony.
-Hey, hot stuff. Give me a kiss.

57
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:34,095
-Look what I made for you. Here.
-Oh, that is beautiful.

58
00:06:34,185 --> 00:06:35,345
-You like it?
-Yeah.

59
00:06:35,436 --> 00:06:36,476
You'll put it in your room?

60
00:06:36,562 --> 00:06:37,602
Yeah, I'll put it in my room right now,
how's that?

61
00:06:37,688 --> 00:06:38,728
-Okay.
-All right.

62
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:54,891
-Dinner's on the table.
-I ain't hungry.

63
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:57,636
Hey, just because
you're kicking in for food,

64
00:07:57,727 --> 00:07:59,097
don't mean you don't gotta eat.

65
00:07:59,228 --> 00:08:00,728
You still gotta eat.

66
00:08:00,855 --> 00:08:03,225
-I got my shirt on, all right?
-So?

67
00:08:03,357 --> 00:08:05,727
So, I don't want to get anything on it,
that's what.

68
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,610
You got nothing to be afraid of.

69
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:10,027
Your mother's spaghetti sauce
don't drip.

70
00:08:10,114 --> 00:08:12,704
It don't taste and it don't drip.

71
00:08:13,784 --> 00:08:15,124
Let's go.

72
00:08:25,254 --> 00:08:27,054
How come every day
it's the same thing?

73
00:08:27,131 --> 00:08:29,221
I come home,
you tell me I'm late for dinner

74
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:32,840
when you know that I gotta work till 6:00
and I can't make dinner on time.

75
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:34,549
You should've been a priest,
like your brother,

76
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:37,099
you wouldn't worry about a job.

77
00:08:37,808 --> 00:08:39,018
Yeah.

78
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:41,979
Every time you mention Frank, Jr,
you gotta cross yourself?

79
00:08:42,104 --> 00:08:46,024
He's a priest, ain't he?
Father Frank, Jr, your brother.

80
00:08:46,108 --> 00:08:49,358
Your mother doesn't have much
to cross herself about these days.

81
00:08:49,445 --> 00:08:51,025
You're so jealous of Frank, Jr.

82
00:08:51,113 --> 00:08:53,283
-Oh, shut up, will you?
-Hey!

83
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:57,793
-What are you doing?
-Hey, the shirt! Watch the shirt, stupid.

84
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,580
-Basta!
-All right. Come on.

85
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:01,794
-Mangia, mangia.
-Yeah, go ahead. Eat, eat.

86
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:03,964
I got more pork chops, more spaghetti.

87
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:06,423
What do you mean, you got
more pork chops? I'm out of work.

88
00:09:06,504 --> 00:09:08,674
Yeah, well, as long as we got $1 left,
we eat good in this house.

89
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:10,548
-What?
-Yeah, I might even get a job myself.

90
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:12,513
Like hell, you will.

91
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:16,755
Twenty-five years in construction work,
I always brought home a paycheque.

92
00:09:16,847 --> 00:09:19,927
What, six, seven months
I'm out of work?

93
00:09:20,017 --> 00:09:21,427
Then, all of a sudden, what?

94
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:23,939
-You're hitting me and talking back.
-All right, all right.

95
00:09:24,021 --> 00:09:25,191
Talking about getting a job
and hitting me.

96
00:09:25,314 --> 00:09:27,774
All right, all right. No hitting,
no slapping at the dinner table. Okay?

97
00:09:27,858 --> 00:09:31,398
That's the rule.
And you was the one that was hitting.

98
00:09:31,487 --> 00:09:33,907
You never hit me before. Never.

99
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:36,580
Not in front of the kids.

100
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:46,000
-One pork chop! One!
-Hey, Frank!

101
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:48,545
It's disgusting, Ma. He's sick.

102
00:09:48,671 --> 00:09:51,171
Will you just watch the hair?

103
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:55,047
You know, I work on my hair a long time
and you hit it.

104
00:09:55,177 --> 00:09:56,847
He hits my hair.

105
00:09:59,181 --> 00:10:02,351
Take care of his hair.
I'm gonna take a walk.

106
00:10:07,356 --> 00:10:09,856
Tony, you walk me to church later?

107
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:11,442
Didn't you go already today?

108
00:10:11,527 --> 00:10:13,817
Yeah, confession.
I gotta go back and pray for something.

109
00:10:13,904 --> 00:10:15,244
For what?

110
00:10:16,365 --> 00:10:18,865
I gotta pray
for Father Frank, Jr to call me.

111
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:20,291
Why don't you call him direct?

112
00:10:20,369 --> 00:10:22,999
I want him to call me.
A son should call his mother.

113
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:27,540
Wait a minute. You're going to church
to have God make Frank, Jr call you?

114
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:29,917
-Right.
-I don't believe it.

115
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:34,633
You know, you're turning God
into a telephone operator.

116
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:53,938
Go, go, now!

117
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:56,990
Hey, you scumbags! Get back here!

118
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:00,580
-Assholes.
-Come on, fuckhead!

119
00:11:01,118 --> 00:11:03,578
Hey, the stubborn fuck won't budge.

120
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:24,521
-Will you put two hands on the wheel?
-I got two hands on the wheel!

121
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,810
Hey, you know, you assholes
almost broke my pussy finger.

122
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:29,476
Oh, yeah, you wouldn't know
which one it was.

123
00:11:29,605 --> 00:11:30,645
Hey, get some of this, will you?

124
00:11:30,773 --> 00:11:31,983
Hey, Gus, tell them what we got.

125
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:34,148
Oh, yeah, we got some ups,
we got some downs,

126
00:11:34,276 --> 00:11:36,566
three ludes, two Js,
and a half a bottle of vodka.

127
00:11:36,654 --> 00:11:37,954
All right, yeah, yeah!

128
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:41,450
That's what you got, huh?
I bet I'd get a bigger high from a fart.

129
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:42,994
-You want something?
-No.

130
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:45,619
We ain't dropping nothing till I say so.

131
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:47,785
-Oh, come on. Why the fuck not?
-Hey, bullshit.

132
00:11:47,873 --> 00:11:49,623
I got my reasons, all right?
I got my reasons.

133
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:51,629
Oh, fuck, Tony.
What's wrong with you, man?

134
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:52,921
Hey, give me the vodka.

135
00:11:53,003 --> 00:11:55,463
Hey, when're you gonna get new tapes?
These things are four years old.

136
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:57,378
I bought them in the bargain basement.

137
00:11:57,466 --> 00:11:59,836
You don't like my tapes?
I'll get new tapes.

138
00:12:32,543 --> 00:12:34,503
Hey, looking sharp, huh?

139
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:36,497
Sharp as you can look
without turning into a nigger.

140
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:38,419
-Or a spic.
-Spic, spic.

141
00:12:38,507 --> 00:12:39,917
Would you put your dick in a spic?

142
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:42,089
-Does it get bigger in a nigger?
-I don't know.

143
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:43,388
I gotta score tonight, man.

144
00:12:43,512 --> 00:12:45,352
I'm horny, you know what I mean?
Horny.

145
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:47,931
Yeah, man, I know what you mean.
Horny, right? Horny!

146
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:50,057
Hey, anybody scores,
you get in the car for 10 minutes,

147
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:51,596
and you're out for the next guy, all right?

148
00:12:51,687 --> 00:12:53,517
If you get five, you get
a medal of honour with rubies,

149
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:54,686
and a piece of the Pope's ass.

150
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:55,864
What are you talking about, man?

151
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:57,441
The Pope don't got no ass,
that's why he's the Pope.

152
00:12:57,526 --> 00:12:59,856
Now, shape up, you assholes.
We're the faces.

153
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:36,904
Tony, how's it going? All right?

154
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:56,794
Hey, Moe!

155
00:14:10,432 --> 00:14:14,022
Hey, Tony, you seen Pauline
around here at all?

156
00:14:14,103 --> 00:14:15,483
No, we ain't seen Pauline.

157
00:14:15,604 --> 00:14:17,814
Joey, you seen Pauline?

158
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:20,280
Hi. What would you like?

159
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:23,569
-Oh, give me a Seven and Seven.
-Yeah, I'll take a beer.

160
00:14:23,654 --> 00:14:24,954
Hey, I'd like a vodka and tonic.

161
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:27,780
You guys wanna go see the Knicks
on Tuesday? Anybody?

162
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:30,327
-Give me a...
-Wanna see the Knicks?

163
00:14:46,468 --> 00:14:47,798
Tony.

164
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:51,724
-Yeah.
-What do you mean, "yeah"?

165
00:14:51,807 --> 00:14:53,307
Well, I mean, I could dance with you,

166
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:56,812
but, you know, you're not
my dream girl or nothing like that.

167
00:14:59,273 --> 00:15:01,153
You want a dream girl?

168
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:03,943
Well, then go to sleep
and have a nightmare.

169
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:06,450
Hey, Gus, here's the speed.

170
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:09,240
What are you doing? Here, take this.

171
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:12,485
HeIIo, again. This is beautifuI Monti,
your deIicious deejay,

172
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:14,698
reminding you about
the UniversaI Disco sweepstakes,

173
00:15:14,788 --> 00:15:17,288
so get in Iine to get the prize.

174
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:20,839
-Oh, looks good!
-Go, baby.

175
00:15:48,238 --> 00:15:52,328
A trip. A good trip.
FeeI the music, baby.

176
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:03,287
Look at that chick.
I'm gonna dance with her.

177
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:04,709
Which one?

178
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:10,304
Come on, Tony! Dance!

179
00:16:25,776 --> 00:16:26,986
All right!

180
00:16:44,712 --> 00:16:46,842
It"s so beautifuI in there.
I Iike your new haircuts.

181
00:16:46,922 --> 00:16:49,842
I Iike that poIyester Iook.
Turn yourseIf there, baby.

182
00:16:58,809 --> 00:17:00,479
All right!

183
00:17:01,228 --> 00:17:02,558
Yeah!

184
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:08,776
Hey, Tony, you know something?

185
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:11,451
You're the king out there.
You're great. You're a great dancer.

186
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:13,490
You could do as good as me
if you practised.

187
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:15,584
Yeah?
Think I'd be a good dancer, Tony?

188
00:17:15,659 --> 00:17:17,909
Sure. Why not? No.

189
00:17:18,912 --> 00:17:20,002
-No?
-No.

190
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:23,790
-Ain't you gonna ask me to sit down?
-No, you'd do it.

191
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:27,206
-But you'd ask me to lay down.
-No, you would not do it.

192
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:30,546
Double J, move over.
I want you to meet my friend here.

193
00:17:30,632 --> 00:17:31,722
Hey.

194
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,260
Hey, Tony, listen,
you want some speed?

195
00:17:33,343 --> 00:17:36,223
It's very good stuff, Ton.
Really, it's good stuff. You want some?

196
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:38,175
Can't you guys get off on dancing?

197
00:17:38,265 --> 00:17:41,675
Tony, can I wipe off your forehead?

198
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:44,601
Why not? Sure. Go ahead.

199
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:50,690
Hey, Doreen, it ain't no blowjob.

200
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:52,818
You don't know fuck
about women, Joey.

201
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:54,905
You get a blowjob easier
than you get that.

202
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:56,320
I noticed.

203
00:17:56,408 --> 00:17:58,328
I love to watch you dance, Tony.

204
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:02,250
-Oh, yeah?
-I love it. I love to watch you dance.

205
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:06,751
I just love it, watching you dance.

206
00:18:06,835 --> 00:18:08,335
Hey, Tony, listen, do her a favour.

207
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:10,090
Why don't you take her
for a dance, huh?

208
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:11,302
That's a good idea. Wanna dance?

209
00:18:11,381 --> 00:18:12,841
Would you like to dance with me?
I'd dance with you.

210
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:14,625
It's for charity.

211
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:18,011
Any kind of dresses
with the lace on the side.

212
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:20,387
Weirdest chick I ever seen.

213
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:24,557
Ton, I love to watch you dance.

214
00:18:26,855 --> 00:18:29,765
I just love it, watching you dance.

215
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:33,396
Doreen, move up a little bit.
Come on, doll.

216
00:18:33,487 --> 00:18:36,107
She's doing a two-step with him.
Jesus Christ.

217
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:39,118
Get your head out of his belt, there, doll.

218
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:40,581
Oh, Jesus.

219
00:18:42,204 --> 00:18:44,544
You can't dance to this shit.

220
00:18:44,873 --> 00:18:47,543
-Let's get the fuck out of here.
-I paid $5 to hear this shit?

221
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:50,456
You paid $5?
I fucking paid for you to get in.

222
00:18:52,089 --> 00:18:54,259
Hey, Monti,
what are you playing that shit for?

223
00:18:54,341 --> 00:18:56,051
What are you talking about, baby?

224
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:59,465
Look at that chick, she's dancing, man.
She's grooving.

225
00:19:26,623 --> 00:19:27,833
-Joey?
-Yeah.

226
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:29,576
You know that girl?

227
00:19:32,212 --> 00:19:33,502
No.

228
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:36,049
-You ever see her before?
-No.

229
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:40,429
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I seen her here
about a month ago.

230
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,900
She can dance, you know that?

231
00:19:48,979 --> 00:19:52,229
She got the wrong partner, of course,
but she can dance.

232
00:19:54,568 --> 00:19:57,198
-Go ask her.
-Fuck you.

233
00:19:57,279 --> 00:19:59,199
Yeah? Which position?

234
00:20:08,624 --> 00:20:10,834
Who the helI's that guy?

235
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:26,057
-Hey, Penny.
-Hey, Tony!

236
00:20:26,141 --> 00:20:28,061
-How you doing?
-Okay. How you been?

237
00:20:28,143 --> 00:20:29,853
All right. You gonna dance for me?

238
00:20:29,937 --> 00:20:31,977
-Sure, why not?
-Okay.

239
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:39,145
-Hello, Lucille.
-Hello, Nureyev. How you doing?

240
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:42,618
-You got a Seven and Seven for me?
-Sure, doll.

241
00:20:42,699 --> 00:20:44,029
Give me one of your butts, too,
all right?

242
00:20:44,117 --> 00:20:45,527
Sure.

243
00:20:49,998 --> 00:20:52,208
Having another sweepstakes.

244
00:20:52,292 --> 00:20:53,752
I know that.

245
00:20:54,544 --> 00:20:57,134
It's double the prize money. $500.

246
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:03,800
You gonna enter?

247
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:06,393
Well, you'll need a partner.

248
00:21:13,188 --> 00:21:14,808
We won before.

249
00:21:15,357 --> 00:21:17,857
But we're gonna have to practise.

250
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:21,029
We'll have to practise.

251
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:23,493
They got people coming in
from Manhattan.

252
00:21:23,573 --> 00:21:26,033
Revelation, Gazebo's.
You know that, right?

253
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:28,488
We'll have to practise.

254
00:21:28,578 --> 00:21:29,948
That's "practise," Annette.

255
00:21:30,038 --> 00:21:32,498
It don't mean dating,
it don't mean socialising,

256
00:21:32,582 --> 00:21:34,422
it means practise.

257
00:21:36,211 --> 00:21:38,461
Why not? We had a date.

258
00:21:39,089 --> 00:21:41,509
Yeah, once, and once was enough.

259
00:21:42,092 --> 00:21:43,382
Why?

260
00:21:43,468 --> 00:21:47,178
Why? Annette, the whole time,
you talked about your married sister.

261
00:21:47,264 --> 00:21:50,184
And then, you was talking
about your other married sister.

262
00:21:50,267 --> 00:21:51,887
And then, your third married sister.

263
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:53,807
I got the idea
that all you was interested in

264
00:21:53,895 --> 00:21:55,685
was being a married sister yourself.

265
00:21:55,772 --> 00:21:57,652
I got bored with it.

266
00:21:57,733 --> 00:22:00,783
Hey, look, I told you
I'd take care of it, huh?

267
00:22:00,861 --> 00:22:04,031
Hey, Tony, look, Double J's been
in the car 25 minutes with some chick.

268
00:22:04,114 --> 00:22:05,204
So what?

269
00:22:05,282 --> 00:22:07,992
So, I can't get the selfish prick out.

270
00:22:08,076 --> 00:22:11,446
These guys can't do nothing without me,
you know that?

271
00:22:26,094 --> 00:22:28,224
Hey, listen, are you gonna
make it with Annette?

272
00:22:28,305 --> 00:22:30,175
No, I don't think so.

273
00:22:30,265 --> 00:22:32,265
You know, Joey, you make it
with some of these chicks,

274
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:33,681
and they think
you gotta dance with them.

275
00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:35,229
Look at this guy, huh?

276
00:22:35,312 --> 00:22:37,772
All right, get out.
You've been in there 20 minutes.

277
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:40,606
-Come on!
-25 in the car, 20 in the chick.

278
00:22:40,692 --> 00:22:43,862
Yeah, well, get out
before we pull you out.

279
00:22:43,945 --> 00:22:47,025
-She ain't come yet.
-Since when do you care?

280
00:22:50,494 --> 00:22:52,084
Hey, come on!

281
00:22:52,621 --> 00:22:54,461
Whoa. Okay.

282
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:56,419
-Harder! Harder!
-Okay, it's happening!

283
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:59,380
It's happening! It's happening!

284
00:22:59,461 --> 00:23:01,591
I'll be out in a minute, man.

285
00:23:01,671 --> 00:23:04,511
Harder! I'm coming! I'm coming!

286
00:23:04,591 --> 00:23:06,591
Oh, yeah!

287
00:23:09,763 --> 00:23:10,933
Yes.

288
00:23:16,603 --> 00:23:17,813
What did you say your name was?

289
00:23:40,168 --> 00:23:41,458
Kiss me.

290
00:23:42,379 --> 00:23:43,669
Kiss me!

291
00:23:47,384 --> 00:23:49,844
Oh, I just kissed Al Pacino!

292
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:31,260
Al Pacino. I don't look like Al Pacino.

293
00:26:33,049 --> 00:26:35,299
Well, I could look like him.

294
00:26:35,385 --> 00:26:36,755
Al Pacino.

295
00:26:37,387 --> 00:26:39,557
Yeah. Al Pacino.

296
00:26:42,642 --> 00:26:45,102
Al Pacino!

297
00:26:45,186 --> 00:26:49,646
"Attica! Attica!

298
00:26:49,733 --> 00:26:51,403
-"Attica!"
-Hey, give me the baII.

299
00:26:53,111 --> 00:26:54,991
Hey, you wanna go see
that Bruce Lee picture at the Orpheum?

300
00:26:55,071 --> 00:26:56,241
-Yeah!
-Hey, you wanna know something?

301
00:26:56,323 --> 00:26:58,283
Bruce Lee's dead,
so I don't give a damn about him.

302
00:26:58,366 --> 00:27:00,866
-Hey, look.
-Man, you got no respect for the dead.

303
00:27:00,952 --> 00:27:02,162
What kind of shit is that, huh?

304
00:27:02,245 --> 00:27:04,075
Hey, you guys see what the Knicks
are gonna pay Frazier?

305
00:27:04,164 --> 00:27:06,374
We're never gonna make
that much money in our whole life.

306
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:09,788
-Hey, douche! Douche!
-It's all right. It's okay.

307
00:27:09,878 --> 00:27:12,168
Hey, you know why
you don't kill fags on Sunday?

308
00:27:12,255 --> 00:27:14,715
You kill fags on Sunday,
they go straight to heaven.

309
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:16,429
Hey, sweetheart! Hey, your turn, isn't it?

310
00:27:16,509 --> 00:27:18,799
You look so heavenly,
it makes me want to die, you know?

311
00:27:18,887 --> 00:27:20,677
Hey, Double J, hey!

312
00:27:21,389 --> 00:27:23,309
You know, this is a drag.

313
00:27:23,391 --> 00:27:25,641
What's with you today, huh?

314
00:27:25,727 --> 00:27:27,847
Nothing.
I'd just rather be doing 2001 tonight.

315
00:27:27,937 --> 00:27:29,397
Yeah? Well, fucking do it.

316
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:31,691
Oh, "fucking do it."
20, 30 bucks, asshole!

317
00:27:31,775 --> 00:27:33,895
You got 20, 30 bucks
to blow twice a week?

318
00:27:33,985 --> 00:27:35,735
-Come on, Tony.
-Hey, Tony.

319
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:38,160
Man, I'm gonna get myself one of these,
you know.

320
00:27:38,239 --> 00:27:39,619
You're never gonna get yourself
one of these.

321
00:27:39,699 --> 00:27:40,779
These things cost too much money.

322
00:27:40,867 --> 00:27:41,947
You'll never have that kind of money.

323
00:27:42,035 --> 00:27:43,575
Hey, you, you know,
I've had you up to here.

324
00:27:43,662 --> 00:27:44,912
That's your favourite speech.

325
00:27:44,996 --> 00:27:46,076
You're never gonna have
that kind of money.

326
00:27:46,164 --> 00:27:47,294
Not you, not me, not anybody.

327
00:27:47,374 --> 00:27:50,084
Hey, get it together before it's all
over the street, huh? You see this?

328
00:27:50,168 --> 00:27:51,498
This is a Caddy Seville.

329
00:27:51,586 --> 00:27:54,126
My Uncle Nunzio's got one of these
and he's got a Mercedes Benz, too.

330
00:27:54,214 --> 00:27:55,344
You know how he got it?

331
00:27:55,423 --> 00:27:58,303
He forced his partner to sell out.
He gave him a real screwing.

332
00:27:58,385 --> 00:28:01,465
It's a dog-eat-dog world, right?
Everybody's out for what they can get.

333
00:28:01,554 --> 00:28:03,184
It's true.

334
00:28:03,264 --> 00:28:05,064
They got it all locked up.

335
00:28:05,141 --> 00:28:06,601
Ain't nobody gonna give you a chance.

336
00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:08,225
Nobody gives you nothing, Joey.

337
00:28:08,311 --> 00:28:10,851
Yeah, you know,
it's every man for himself.

338
00:28:10,939 --> 00:28:13,069
It's a stinking rat race.

339
00:28:15,235 --> 00:28:18,735
Hey, that stuff goes on beautiful, Tony.
Best vinyl I ever seen at that price.

340
00:28:18,822 --> 00:28:21,282
See? I told you.
You just listen to me, right?

341
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:24,116
You know, you saved me a bit
of change on the job. You know paint.

342
00:28:24,202 --> 00:28:26,372
You ever want a job as a painter,
why don't you let me know, huh?

343
00:28:26,454 --> 00:28:28,214
You make twice as much
as you make here,

344
00:28:28,289 --> 00:28:30,459
but you break your back.
You interested?

345
00:28:30,583 --> 00:28:32,463
-I don't know.
-Don't be interested.

346
00:28:32,585 --> 00:28:36,045
You'll make twice as much,
but you'll break your back.

347
00:28:36,131 --> 00:28:39,471
-No advances, no nothing. It's payday...
-I gave you a raise.

348
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:41,721
-You gave me what?
-A raise.

349
00:28:41,803 --> 00:28:45,643
-You kidding me?
-No. Come on, look. See how much it is.

350
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:48,064
You gave me a raise? Thank you.
I can't believe this.

351
00:28:48,143 --> 00:28:49,563
Wait, hold on, you better look first.

352
00:28:49,644 --> 00:28:51,234
I don't gotta look.
It don't make no difference.

353
00:28:51,312 --> 00:28:52,902
You gave me a raise.
That's the important thing.

354
00:28:52,981 --> 00:28:55,321
-It's only $2.50.
-So what?

355
00:28:55,442 --> 00:28:57,822
That's $2.50. It ain't much.

356
00:28:57,902 --> 00:29:00,402
The important thing is it's a raise.
I think that's really great.

357
00:29:00,488 --> 00:29:02,408
I'll tell you what,
I'm gonna give you $3.50, all right?

358
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:03,910
-You do not have to, Mr Fusco.
-I'll give you $3.50.

359
00:29:03,992 --> 00:29:05,492
-I like the raise how it is.
-I'll give you $1 more.

360
00:29:05,618 --> 00:29:07,828
Shut up, will you? $4.

361
00:29:07,912 --> 00:29:10,082
I'll make it an even $4.

362
00:29:10,165 --> 00:29:11,495
Christ, I've never seen anybody

363
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:14,083
so shit-ass happy over
a crummy $2.50 raise.

364
00:29:14,169 --> 00:29:17,669
Wait a minute. $2?
You just said $4.00, didn't you?

365
00:29:22,927 --> 00:29:24,177
What the hell are you doing?

366
00:29:24,304 --> 00:29:26,684
-I just feel like it, all right?
-Girls do that.

367
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:28,765
I got a raise today.
How do you like that?

368
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:30,930
Yeah?
Why didn't you say so during dinner?

369
00:29:31,019 --> 00:29:34,519
We could've used the conversation.
Put them down. Come here.

370
00:29:34,647 --> 00:29:37,437
-How much you get?
-It's gonna be $4.00.

371
00:29:37,525 --> 00:29:39,855
It was... It was $2.50, right?

372
00:29:39,986 --> 00:29:41,696
But he raised the raise

373
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:44,280
when he found out
I wasn't so, you know, disappointed.

374
00:29:44,365 --> 00:29:45,865
-$4.00?
-Yeah.

375
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:49,040
Shit. You know what $4.00 buys today?

376
00:29:49,162 --> 00:29:51,462
It don't even buy $3.00.

377
00:29:51,539 --> 00:29:54,289
I don't see nobody giving you a raise
down at Unemployment.

378
00:29:54,375 --> 00:29:56,875
$4.00. Shit.

379
00:29:56,961 --> 00:29:59,631
I knew you'd piss on it.
Go on, just piss on it, right?

380
00:29:59,714 --> 00:30:02,304
A raise says, like, you're good,
you know what I mean?

381
00:30:02,383 --> 00:30:04,643
You know how many times somebody
told me I was good in my life?

382
00:30:04,719 --> 00:30:06,889
Two. Two. Twice. Two fucking times,

383
00:30:07,013 --> 00:30:09,893
this raise today and dancing,
dancing at the disco.

384
00:30:10,016 --> 00:30:12,726
You sure as fuck never did. Asshole.

385
00:30:14,896 --> 00:30:17,646
$4.00. Shit.

386
00:30:37,877 --> 00:30:39,417
Why ain't you waiting inside?

387
00:30:39,504 --> 00:30:41,674
Well, I wanted to watch you
come down the street.

388
00:30:41,756 --> 00:30:43,416
I like the way you walk.

389
00:30:43,508 --> 00:30:45,338
Shit.

390
00:30:45,426 --> 00:30:49,256
Tony, listen, I've been thinking.

391
00:30:50,265 --> 00:30:52,015
Maybe I'll make it with you.

392
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:55,270
That's what you call thinking, huh?
Jesus Christ.

393
00:30:56,396 --> 00:30:58,516
You know what? You're too much,
Annette. You know that?

394
00:30:58,606 --> 00:31:01,606
I mean, you say we're gonna make it,
that means we're gonna make it, right?

395
00:31:01,734 --> 00:31:03,534
I mean, like,
I got no say in this at all, right?

396
00:31:03,611 --> 00:31:05,031
It's time we went out.

397
00:31:05,113 --> 00:31:06,613
You told me you wanted to do it.

398
00:31:06,739 --> 00:31:08,529
You told me
how horny a man gets when he's 19,

399
00:31:08,616 --> 00:31:10,446
how much his balls ache
morning, noon and night,

400
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:13,445
six days a week, sometimes seven,
if he don't get it.

401
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:15,960
How do you remember those things?

402
00:31:16,082 --> 00:31:18,382
Look, Annette, we're gonna be
spending a lot of time together,

403
00:31:18,459 --> 00:31:20,789
you know, rehearsing,
practising, whatnot.

404
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:24,050
If we was balling,
it would be like we was going together.

405
00:31:24,132 --> 00:31:26,302
And I won't be going with you.

406
00:31:26,384 --> 00:31:28,974
Look, I mean, what are you, anyway?
You a nice girl or you a cunt?

407
00:31:29,053 --> 00:31:31,143
I don't know. Both?

408
00:31:31,264 --> 00:31:34,064
You can't be both. I mean, that's a thing
a girI's gotta decide early on.

409
00:31:34,142 --> 00:31:37,142
You gotta decide whether
you're gonna be a nice girl or a cunt.

410
00:31:37,228 --> 00:31:39,308
-How you doing, Pete?
-Hey, Tony, my man.

411
00:31:39,439 --> 00:31:41,729
-You got a studio free or what?
-Yeah, two is free.

412
00:31:41,816 --> 00:31:46,106
-Good. Hey, how you doing?
-Steady at 65%.

413
00:31:47,572 --> 00:31:50,572
Pete. He's always busting my onions.

414
00:31:50,658 --> 00:31:53,738
I send him a lot of customers, you know.
He gives me free studio time when...

415
00:31:53,828 --> 00:31:55,788
What did he mean, 65%?

416
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:59,291
Oh, that... Oh, that means that he...

417
00:32:00,251 --> 00:32:03,671
He scores with 65% of the chicks
that come in here.

418
00:32:09,177 --> 00:32:11,507
And one, two, three, two, two, three.

419
00:32:11,638 --> 00:32:13,508
One, two, one, two, three.

420
00:32:13,598 --> 00:32:15,598
One, two, three. Good.
Two, two, three. Good.

421
00:32:15,683 --> 00:32:17,523
One, two, one, two, three.

422
00:32:17,644 --> 00:32:19,104
Good, that's it.

423
00:32:19,187 --> 00:32:20,687
Now do it again.

424
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:32,620
That's it, good. All right. All right. Again.

425
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:34,450
Tony, it's only dancing. Jesus.

426
00:32:34,535 --> 00:32:36,785
Only dancing? Forget it, Annette.

427
00:32:36,871 --> 00:32:39,211
If you're not gonna take this seriously,
I don't wanna dance.

428
00:32:39,332 --> 00:32:40,792
-Don't get mad.
-"Don't get mad."

429
00:32:40,875 --> 00:32:42,205
Jesus.

430
00:32:45,505 --> 00:32:48,965
Look, I think we done
enough dancing for today.

431
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:51,640
So, why don't we... Why don't we
dance Wednesday, all right?

432
00:32:51,719 --> 00:32:53,219
Yeah. Sure.

433
00:32:53,972 --> 00:32:56,142
-All right. Here.
-You walking home now?

434
00:32:56,224 --> 00:32:59,734
No. I'm gonna stick around
and talk to Peter a little bit,

435
00:32:59,852 --> 00:33:02,732
and, you know,
work on some stuff myself.

436
00:33:02,855 --> 00:33:05,145
-I'll see you later, all right?
-Yeah.

437
00:33:05,233 --> 00:33:07,033
You was good today.

438
00:33:34,095 --> 00:33:36,425
Hi. How you doing?

439
00:33:40,101 --> 00:33:43,561
Hey, you know, you're
a very good dancer, you know that?

440
00:33:45,565 --> 00:33:47,605
I would like to meet you.

441
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:52,280
Look, would you...
Would you mind just going away, okay?

442
00:33:52,363 --> 00:33:54,363
-What?
-Don't be hurt, but l...

443
00:33:54,449 --> 00:33:55,619
Don't be hurt?

444
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:58,290
Yeah, I wanna be by myself now,
you know?

445
00:33:58,411 --> 00:33:59,791
Listen, I seen you at 2001
the other night.

446
00:33:59,912 --> 00:34:01,542
Yeah, so? So?

447
00:34:01,622 --> 00:34:04,212
Well, I mean, you was looking at me
and I was looking at you, remember?

448
00:34:04,292 --> 00:34:06,882
Well, what is this? I look at a guy
longer than a millionth of a second,

449
00:34:06,961 --> 00:34:10,051
already, he gets delusions of grandeur.

450
00:34:10,131 --> 00:34:12,551
You know what you are?
I'm gonna tell you what you are.

451
00:34:12,633 --> 00:34:15,553
I bet it begins with a "C," Mr P.

452
00:34:15,636 --> 00:34:18,966
Oh, fine. Fine. That's...

453
00:34:19,098 --> 00:34:21,928
I know the type. I know the type. Fine.

454
00:34:30,651 --> 00:34:33,151
What you doing up so late?

455
00:34:33,237 --> 00:34:37,067
What is this? I walk in,
you don't got no criticism of me?

456
00:34:38,117 --> 00:34:41,237
-Your brother's upstairs.
-You're kidding.

457
00:34:41,329 --> 00:34:43,249
-Yo, Frankie!
-Tony.

458
00:34:43,331 --> 00:34:45,671
-Hey, how you doing?
-Hiya, kid.

459
00:34:48,127 --> 00:34:50,087
-It's good to see you.
-You, too.

460
00:34:50,171 --> 00:34:52,511
Yeah. You look good.

461
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:55,510
No, I don't. You do. You look wonderful.

462
00:34:55,635 --> 00:34:58,255
-You checking out my trophy?
-Oh, yeah. That's you, huh?

463
00:34:58,346 --> 00:35:00,176
-Yeah.
-"First prize."

464
00:35:00,932 --> 00:35:02,852
Looks just like you.

465
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:04,434
Hey, what did you say
to them downstairs?

466
00:35:04,519 --> 00:35:06,349
They look crazy,
they look like zombies, like...

467
00:35:06,479 --> 00:35:08,519
Like somebody died or something.

468
00:35:08,648 --> 00:35:10,648
I think they're in shock, Tony.

469
00:35:10,733 --> 00:35:14,323
In shock?
Well, how come they're in shock?

470
00:35:14,403 --> 00:35:16,703
I'm leaving the church, Tony.

471
00:35:17,532 --> 00:35:20,332
Oh, yeah, yeah. Sure.
Leaving the church.

472
00:35:21,494 --> 00:35:24,834
-Tell me another one.
-I'm leaving the priesthood.

473
00:35:25,873 --> 00:35:28,923
Oh, come on, Frank.
Don't fool around like that.

474
00:35:29,043 --> 00:35:30,843
Do you think I'm losing my hair?

475
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:33,880
It looks awful thin
right over here and here.

476
00:35:35,883 --> 00:35:38,263
Are you serious?

477
00:35:38,386 --> 00:35:40,176
Can I borrow some of your clothes
until I buy some?

478
00:35:40,263 --> 00:35:42,723
I don't want to wear the uniform.

479
00:35:44,225 --> 00:35:46,305
I'm sorry, Frank. I really am. I'm sorry.

480
00:35:46,394 --> 00:35:48,404
What are you sorry about?

481
00:35:49,438 --> 00:35:51,398
You got fired, huh?

482
00:35:51,524 --> 00:35:53,444
I didn't get fired. I quit.

483
00:35:53,568 --> 00:35:54,728
You quit?

484
00:35:54,861 --> 00:35:57,571
Yeah, you can do those things,
you know.

485
00:36:06,581 --> 00:36:10,131
What did Mom say?
What did she say about it?

486
00:36:10,251 --> 00:36:14,801
She said, "Dear Lord, what am I
gonna tell Theresa and Marie?"

487
00:36:14,922 --> 00:36:18,432
-And Dad? What did he say about it?
-They're ashamed, the both of them.

488
00:36:18,551 --> 00:36:20,551
They're ashamed, right?

489
00:36:22,221 --> 00:36:24,261
You ashamed of me, Tony?

490
00:36:25,558 --> 00:36:27,268
Yeah, you are.

491
00:36:28,769 --> 00:36:31,899
-They didn't ask why or nothing?
-No.

492
00:36:31,981 --> 00:36:35,781
I think they're afraid to.
Like, I might say, "celibacy."

493
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,450
But...

494
00:36:47,622 --> 00:36:50,752
You gonna sleep here tonight?
You wanna sleep in my room?

495
00:36:50,833 --> 00:36:53,753
-Yeah, I thought I would.
-All right, you can...

496
00:36:53,836 --> 00:36:56,246
I'll get your blankets for you.

497
00:37:16,108 --> 00:37:18,608
Frank, how come you left? Really?

498
00:37:22,365 --> 00:37:25,825
It's not easy to explain, Anthony.
A lot of things.

499
00:37:26,869 --> 00:37:29,329
One day, you look at a crucifix,

500
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:33,880
and all you see
is a man dying on a cross.

501
00:37:35,211 --> 00:37:38,171
But that's only a backdrop
to something else.

502
00:37:39,215 --> 00:37:43,385
Mama and Papa,
their dreams of pious glory.

503
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:46,970
They turn you
into what they wish at a time...

504
00:37:48,474 --> 00:37:52,234
You can't defend yourself
against their fantasies.

505
00:37:52,353 --> 00:37:56,523
All I ever really had any belief in
was their image of me as a priest.

506
00:37:56,649 --> 00:37:58,019
That's all.

507
00:38:05,908 --> 00:38:10,078
Guess we're gonna have to take
your picture down from the mantle.

508
00:38:14,375 --> 00:38:16,455
Know what's weird?

509
00:38:16,544 --> 00:38:19,714
Like, I always felt like
I was the shit of the family,

510
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:21,169
and you was always, like, perfect.

511
00:38:21,257 --> 00:38:25,677
Now that I'm the disgrace to the family,
I'm not so perfect any more.

512
00:38:26,429 --> 00:38:29,059
So, maybe you're not shit any more.

513
00:38:31,517 --> 00:38:35,267
Yeah, maybe if you ain't so good,
I ain't so bad, you know?

514
00:38:35,938 --> 00:38:37,188
Yeah.

515
00:38:39,275 --> 00:38:40,395
Ha.

516
00:38:46,907 --> 00:38:48,447
-Give me the groceries, motherfucker.
-Hey, come on.

517
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:49,906
-Hey, don't take my groceries, man.
-I'm hungry.

518
00:38:50,036 --> 00:38:51,406
-I'm hungry, Gus.
-Hey, what are you doing?

519
00:38:51,537 --> 00:38:53,907
Hey, come on! Hey, come on!
Hey, don't eat the apple!

520
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:55,920
-Give me... Give me it back.
-Here.

521
00:38:56,042 --> 00:38:58,172
Jesus.
What's the matter with you anyway?

522
00:38:58,252 --> 00:39:00,552
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

523
00:39:00,629 --> 00:39:02,509
My brother, he quit the Church.
You believe that?

524
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:03,970
-Yeah?
-I feel...

525
00:39:04,091 --> 00:39:06,131
I feel wild. I got all this energy.
I can't believe it.

526
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:07,300
Yeah?

527
00:39:07,428 --> 00:39:08,798
Hey, listen, I'll call you later tonight,
all right?

528
00:39:08,929 --> 00:39:10,219
Yeah, we'll do... Hey!

529
00:39:10,306 --> 00:39:12,886
-See you later, Gus.
-I'll see you.

530
00:39:14,101 --> 00:39:15,981
Come on, honey, higher with the arms.

531
00:39:16,062 --> 00:39:18,272
Yeah, that's it.

532
00:39:18,397 --> 00:39:20,397
Yeah, do it to me!

533
00:39:23,319 --> 00:39:24,649
Pete, she come in?

534
00:39:24,779 --> 00:39:26,909
I told you on the phone,
she comes in on Tuesday.

535
00:39:26,989 --> 00:39:29,819
-I know. So, did she come in or what?
-And what is it today, huh?

536
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:31,740
-It's Tuesday.
-Yeah.

537
00:39:33,662 --> 00:39:37,542
Hey, Ton! Watch it, man.
That one's practising to be a bitch.

538
00:39:37,625 --> 00:39:39,325
Come on, people!

539
00:39:40,669 --> 00:39:45,089
Good, yeah. Oh, that's good.
You're doing great. Yeah.

540
00:40:17,498 --> 00:40:19,668
Hello, Stephanie Mangano.

541
00:40:19,792 --> 00:40:22,092
I'm Tony Manero.

542
00:40:22,169 --> 00:40:25,129
We both got the same last initials.
How do you like that?

543
00:40:25,214 --> 00:40:27,344
Wow. We get married,
I don't have to change the monogram

544
00:40:27,466 --> 00:40:29,336
on my luggage, huh?

545
00:40:30,845 --> 00:40:33,005
Somebody told me
you was practising to be a bitch.

546
00:40:33,139 --> 00:40:34,349
Is that true?

547
00:40:41,730 --> 00:40:43,900
All right, Mr Manero.
What do you want to ask me?

548
00:40:44,024 --> 00:40:46,034
I would like to take you out to coffee.
Would that be good?

549
00:40:46,152 --> 00:40:48,112
That's it, huh?
You want me to have coffee with you?

550
00:40:48,195 --> 00:40:50,065
I think you're a very good dancer.

551
00:40:50,197 --> 00:40:53,827
You know that 2001 Odyssey,

552
00:40:53,909 --> 00:40:56,449
they got a dance contest now.

553
00:40:56,537 --> 00:41:00,037
And I think that we could be
a dynamite team together.

554
00:41:03,586 --> 00:41:05,916
-How old are you, huh?
-I'm 20.

555
00:41:07,214 --> 00:41:12,144
Well, I'm 19 at the moment,
but I'll be 20 very shortly.

556
00:41:12,219 --> 00:41:13,679
What I think is this.

557
00:41:13,762 --> 00:41:15,722
There's a world of difference
between us, you know?

558
00:41:15,848 --> 00:41:18,558
Not just chronologically,
but emotionally,

559
00:41:18,684 --> 00:41:21,024
culturally, physically, every which way.

560
00:41:21,103 --> 00:41:22,813
And this world would get much bigger

561
00:41:22,897 --> 00:41:25,687
and much worse
with every passing week.

562
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,110
What kind of shit is that?

563
00:41:28,235 --> 00:41:30,775
-Coffee, not sex.
-Just coffee, huh?

564
00:41:30,905 --> 00:41:33,655
See, look, where I work,
the people are very remarkable.

565
00:41:33,741 --> 00:41:36,241
They're not like these here
Bay Ridge people at all.

566
00:41:36,368 --> 00:41:38,368
You mean snobs
instead of slobs, right?

567
00:41:38,454 --> 00:41:40,334
-What?
-Nothing.

568
00:41:40,414 --> 00:41:42,504
Hey, you know, Bay Ridge
ain't the worst part of Brooklyn.

569
00:41:42,583 --> 00:41:43,673
You know what I'm talking?

570
00:41:43,751 --> 00:41:45,421
I mean, you know,
it ain't like a hellhole or nothing.

571
00:41:45,544 --> 00:41:48,304
Yeah, well, it ain't Manhattan.
It isn't Manhattan.

572
00:41:48,422 --> 00:41:50,222
You got no idea how it changes,
you know.

573
00:41:50,299 --> 00:41:51,719
Just right over there,
right across the river,

574
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:53,970
everything is different,
completely different.

575
00:41:54,094 --> 00:41:55,554
It's beautiful, just beautiful.

576
00:41:55,638 --> 00:41:58,468
The people are beautiful,
offices are beautiful.

577
00:41:58,599 --> 00:42:01,269
The secretaries, you know,
they all shop at Bonwit Teller.

578
00:42:01,352 --> 00:42:02,482
Oh, yeah?

579
00:42:02,603 --> 00:42:04,403
And, like, the lunch hours
are beautiful, too.

580
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:07,820
Like, you know, they'll give you,
like, two hours for lunch

581
00:42:07,942 --> 00:42:09,612
-to do something that's related.
-Oh, yeah?

582
00:42:09,693 --> 00:42:12,533
Like we've seen
Zeffirelli's Romeo and Juliet.

583
00:42:12,613 --> 00:42:16,533
Over here. Romeo and Juliet, yeah?
I read that in high school.

584
00:42:16,617 --> 00:42:19,617
That's... That's Shakespeare, right?

585
00:42:19,703 --> 00:42:22,713
No, it's Zeffirelli,
the director of the movie.

586
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:25,880
-You know, the movie? Film.
-Yeah.

587
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:28,380
You know what?
What I never understood

588
00:42:28,462 --> 00:42:30,342
about that Romeo and Juliet,

589
00:42:30,464 --> 00:42:33,764
I never understood why Romeo,
he took the poison so quick, you know?

590
00:42:33,842 --> 00:42:36,512
I feel like he could have waited
or something.

591
00:42:36,637 --> 00:42:39,637
Well, that's the way
they took the poison in those days.

592
00:42:41,517 --> 00:42:43,887
Hey, you gonna eat?
Here, look at a menu.

593
00:42:43,978 --> 00:42:46,898
No, no. I'll just have tea.
Tea with lemon.

594
00:42:47,815 --> 00:42:51,525
I started drinking tea recently, you know.
It's really a lot more refined.

595
00:42:51,652 --> 00:42:53,362
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.

596
00:42:53,487 --> 00:42:54,947
All those women executives
in my office,

597
00:42:55,030 --> 00:42:56,490
they all drink tea with lemon.

598
00:42:56,574 --> 00:43:00,124
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah. And you notice that I do, too.

599
00:43:00,202 --> 00:43:03,502
-I like coffee, you know? I drink coffee.
-Yeah.

600
00:43:07,001 --> 00:43:10,711
You see, like, I've only been
at this agency a really short time,

601
00:43:10,838 --> 00:43:15,468
but already I'm functioning in a, kind of,
public relations capacity, you know.

602
00:43:15,551 --> 00:43:18,181
I fill in for the agents
when they're elsewhere.

603
00:43:18,262 --> 00:43:20,722
Like, this week, you know, I had...

604
00:43:20,848 --> 00:43:23,728
I had business lunches
with Eric Clapton at La Cote Basque

605
00:43:23,851 --> 00:43:26,851
-and Cat Stevens at Le Madrigal.
-Oh, far out.

606
00:43:26,937 --> 00:43:30,357
Yeah. You heard of
those restaurants, huh?

607
00:43:30,441 --> 00:43:34,441
No, I don't know
those exact restaurants.

608
00:43:34,528 --> 00:43:35,738
I know the type.

609
00:43:35,863 --> 00:43:37,953
Yeah, but you must have heard
of the artists.

610
00:43:38,032 --> 00:43:40,952
No, l... Not... I don't know... You know.

611
00:43:41,035 --> 00:43:42,445
Not really.

612
00:43:43,203 --> 00:43:45,123
So what did you say "far out" for, huh?

613
00:43:45,205 --> 00:43:47,705
'Cause it sounded, like, far out.
Wasn't it? I mean...

614
00:43:47,791 --> 00:43:50,921
-Well, yeah.
-We'd like a lemon with some tea now.

615
00:43:51,045 --> 00:43:54,545
And I'd like a cheeseburger
and some coffee.

616
00:44:00,554 --> 00:44:02,604
Hey, you know who came
in the office the other day?

617
00:44:02,723 --> 00:44:04,723
-Who?
-Laurence Olivier.

618
00:44:04,808 --> 00:44:05,978
Who's that?

619
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:09,350
Who's Laurence Olivier?
You don't know who he is?

620
00:44:09,438 --> 00:44:10,768
Laurence Olivier, man!

621
00:44:10,898 --> 00:44:12,978
He's the greatest actor
in the whole world.

622
00:44:13,067 --> 00:44:15,147
Oh, come on, you know who he is.

623
00:44:15,235 --> 00:44:16,435
He's the English actor,

624
00:44:16,570 --> 00:44:19,490
the one on television who does
all those Polaroid commercials.

625
00:44:19,573 --> 00:44:21,873
You know, Laurence Olivier.

626
00:44:21,950 --> 00:44:24,700
-Oh, him. Oh, he's good. He is good.
-Yeah.

627
00:44:24,787 --> 00:44:26,497
Well, anyway,
he comes in the office, right?

628
00:44:26,580 --> 00:44:28,160
So, I just do a few errands for him.

629
00:44:28,248 --> 00:44:30,418
So, he goes around,
he tells everybody in the entire office,

630
00:44:30,501 --> 00:44:31,751
he says I'm the brightest,

631
00:44:31,835 --> 00:44:35,415
I'm the most vivacious thing
in the entire office he's seen in years.

632
00:44:35,506 --> 00:44:36,956
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.

633
00:44:37,091 --> 00:44:41,681
Do you think that you could get, like,
a camera from him at a discount?

634
00:44:41,762 --> 00:44:44,432
I didn't ask him about a camera.

635
00:44:44,515 --> 00:44:46,635
'Cause you got one already, right,
you sly fox, you.

636
00:44:46,767 --> 00:44:48,687
Hey, look, are you enjoying
all this stuff I'm telling you?

637
00:44:48,769 --> 00:44:50,139
Sure. I think it's good.

638
00:44:50,270 --> 00:44:52,650
Well, I just think maybe you can't handle
hearing about a kind of life

639
00:44:52,773 --> 00:44:55,823
that is so completely different
than yours.

640
00:44:55,943 --> 00:44:59,283
-You mean "better," don't you?
-Yes, I mean better. Sure, it's better.

641
00:44:59,363 --> 00:45:01,113
Can I have some ketchup, please?

642
00:45:01,198 --> 00:45:03,028
I mean, I'm out of this scene
almost completely,

643
00:45:03,117 --> 00:45:05,197
you know, this Bay Ridge scene.
I'm moving into Manhattan.

644
00:45:05,285 --> 00:45:07,745
I'm getting my own apartment.

645
00:45:07,830 --> 00:45:09,330
I'm changing.

646
00:45:09,456 --> 00:45:11,706
I'm really changing as a person,
and I'm growing.

647
00:45:11,792 --> 00:45:14,292
You know what I mean? Nobody has
any idea how much I'm growing.

648
00:45:14,378 --> 00:45:16,498
Why don't you go on a diet?

649
00:45:22,302 --> 00:45:25,102
Okay, listen. I like you.
We could dance together.

650
00:45:25,180 --> 00:45:27,680
That's it. We could just dance together
and nothing more.

651
00:45:27,808 --> 00:45:29,928
Nothing personal.
I don't want you coming on to me.

652
00:45:30,018 --> 00:45:31,098
Why not?

653
00:45:31,186 --> 00:45:33,686
Because I don't date guys
like you any more, for one thing.

654
00:45:33,814 --> 00:45:35,944
You're too young,
you haven't got any class, and, yeah,

655
00:45:36,024 --> 00:45:38,574
I'm sick ofjerk-off guys
ain't got their shit together!

656
00:45:38,652 --> 00:45:41,322
Oh, come on.
It's easy to get your shit together.

657
00:45:41,405 --> 00:45:44,815
All you need is a salad bowl
and a potato masher.

658
00:45:45,701 --> 00:45:47,411
Get your shit together.

659
00:45:47,494 --> 00:45:50,124
-Would you like to know what I do?
-It's not necessary.

660
00:45:50,205 --> 00:45:51,955
I'll tell you what I do.

661
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:55,210
I work in a paint store,
and I got a raise this week.

662
00:45:55,335 --> 00:45:57,085
Right. You work in a paint store, right?

663
00:45:57,171 --> 00:45:59,461
You probably live with your family,
you hang out with your buddies,

664
00:45:59,548 --> 00:46:02,468
and on Saturday night you go,
you blow it all off at 2001, right?

665
00:46:02,551 --> 00:46:05,181
-That's right.
-You're a cliché.

666
00:46:05,262 --> 00:46:08,182
You're nowhere,
on your way to no place.

667
00:46:11,852 --> 00:46:14,272
What do you got?
A fucking stairway to the stars or what?

668
00:46:14,354 --> 00:46:15,654
-Yeah, maybe.
-Yeah.

669
00:46:15,731 --> 00:46:17,321
I'm taking a course, nights,
at the new school.

670
00:46:17,399 --> 00:46:19,069
Next semester, I'm gonna take two.

671
00:46:19,193 --> 00:46:20,903
Now, you, you probably
didn't get no college, did you?

672
00:46:21,028 --> 00:46:22,198
No, I did not.

673
00:46:22,279 --> 00:46:24,109
Well, did you ever think
about going to college?

674
00:46:24,198 --> 00:46:25,568
-No.
-Not ever?

675
00:46:25,699 --> 00:46:27,449
-No. Did you?
-Well, not back then, no...

676
00:46:27,534 --> 00:46:29,494
Then why the fuck
are you bugging me about it for?

677
00:46:29,578 --> 00:46:31,658
Well, why not? Why didn't
you ever want to go to college?

678
00:46:31,747 --> 00:46:34,247
-Oh, just fuck off, will you? I did not.
-No, really. Tell me. Why not?

679
00:46:34,374 --> 00:46:36,544
Oh, Jesus Christ! I didn't!

680
00:46:41,048 --> 00:46:44,008
The thing is
the high I get at 2001 is just dancing,

681
00:46:44,092 --> 00:46:47,432
it's not being the best
or nothing like that.

682
00:46:47,554 --> 00:46:49,974
The only thing is
that I would like to get that high

683
00:46:50,057 --> 00:46:53,227
someplace else in my life. You know?

684
00:46:53,310 --> 00:46:54,890
Like where?

685
00:46:54,978 --> 00:46:58,438
I don't know where.
I don't know. Someplace.

686
00:46:58,565 --> 00:47:01,435
You see, dancing, it can't last forever.

687
00:47:01,568 --> 00:47:04,068
It's a short-lived kind of thing.

688
00:47:04,154 --> 00:47:06,614
But I'm getting older, you know.

689
00:47:08,242 --> 00:47:09,242
You know, I feel like...

690
00:47:09,326 --> 00:47:11,236
I feel like, you know,
so what, I'm getting older.

691
00:47:11,328 --> 00:47:13,908
Does that mean, like, I can't feel
that way about nothing left in my life?

692
00:47:13,997 --> 00:47:15,867
You know? Is that it?

693
00:47:15,958 --> 00:47:18,498
Listen, we gotta split here.

694
00:47:18,585 --> 00:47:20,955
No, I'll walk you the rest of the way.

695
00:47:21,088 --> 00:47:24,668
No, I'll meet you at the dance studio,
just like we said, okay?

696
00:47:24,758 --> 00:47:26,468
Stephanie, I can walk you home.

697
00:47:26,593 --> 00:47:29,433
Look, nothing personal, right?

698
00:47:29,513 --> 00:47:32,313
Oh, come on, Stephanie. I can walk you.

699
00:47:33,642 --> 00:47:37,272
Oh, Jesus Christ! You know?

700
00:47:45,153 --> 00:47:46,493
I don't know where he is.

701
00:47:46,613 --> 00:47:48,493
-Did you call him?
-No.

702
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:54,830
What's the matter? What's going on?

703
00:47:54,955 --> 00:47:57,745
It's Gus, man. He's in the hospital.
The spics got him.

704
00:47:57,833 --> 00:47:59,503
-Spanish Barons?
-Barracudas.

705
00:47:59,626 --> 00:48:01,956
-Hey, that's my fucking car!
-Forget the car!

706
00:48:02,045 --> 00:48:04,005
-Save it for the spics.
-Just give me the keys.

707
00:48:04,131 --> 00:48:07,051
-You're asking for it.
-I can't believe it. I just saw him.

708
00:48:07,134 --> 00:48:09,844
He could have run, you know?
But he hung tight. That's Gus.

709
00:48:09,970 --> 00:48:12,010
Don't worry about it. Okay? All right?

710
00:48:12,139 --> 00:48:13,809
I got in the hospital to see him.

711
00:48:13,891 --> 00:48:17,441
He got a broken nose, busted ribs,
a broken leg and four teeth knocked out.

712
00:48:17,519 --> 00:48:18,599
Shit.

713
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:21,437
I mean, all he was doing was walking
along the street carrying his groceries,

714
00:48:21,523 --> 00:48:23,193
and three of them
do a shove number on him.

715
00:48:23,317 --> 00:48:25,687
They spill his fucking groceries
into the street.

716
00:48:25,819 --> 00:48:28,779
So, he says under his breath,
"grease balls, spic dicks,"

717
00:48:28,864 --> 00:48:30,204
and they laid into him.

718
00:48:42,085 --> 00:48:44,245
All right. Go check it out.

719
00:49:02,064 --> 00:49:04,074
Nobody in there, man.

720
00:49:08,028 --> 00:49:09,698
All right, all right.
This is what we're gonna do.

721
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:10,910
We're just gonna cruise around

722
00:49:10,989 --> 00:49:12,819
until there's enough of them
that we can handle.

723
00:49:12,908 --> 00:49:15,028
Yeah, yeah, we'll just pick
off a couple on the street.

724
00:49:15,118 --> 00:49:16,988
-That's pussy, man!
-Fuck, man. Fuck.

725
00:49:17,079 --> 00:49:20,209
-You're fucked up!
-I'm sorry, guys.

726
00:49:20,290 --> 00:49:23,290
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

727
00:49:23,377 --> 00:49:24,667
You're sorry.

728
00:49:25,253 --> 00:49:27,633
Oh, forget it. We'll get them tomorrow.

729
00:49:31,426 --> 00:49:34,136
All right, dream good. Jerk off better.

730
00:49:36,890 --> 00:49:38,980
Tony, I'm getting married.

731
00:49:39,893 --> 00:49:41,233
Will you cut it with that shit?

732
00:49:41,311 --> 00:49:44,021
No, listen.
I just wanted to let you know, all right?

733
00:49:44,106 --> 00:49:45,516
All right. Look. If you get married,

734
00:49:45,607 --> 00:49:47,357
we'll all go with you
on your honeymoon, all right?

735
00:49:47,442 --> 00:49:50,782
-You will? Okay.
-Okay, good. Take it easy.

736
00:49:50,862 --> 00:49:53,322
Come on, Bobby. Get in the car.

737
00:49:54,074 --> 00:49:55,454
Hey.

738
00:49:55,534 --> 00:49:58,204
Hey, you know,
we should go to the hospital tomorrow.

739
00:49:58,286 --> 00:49:59,946
You know what I'm talking?

740
00:50:00,038 --> 00:50:03,538
And you, cool off! You know?

741
00:50:03,625 --> 00:50:05,535
All right. Good night.

742
00:50:28,692 --> 00:50:31,322
Tony, what did you say
to Father Frank, Jr?

743
00:50:31,403 --> 00:50:33,653
-What?
-What did you say? What did you do?

744
00:50:33,739 --> 00:50:35,029
Yeah, what did you say?

745
00:50:35,115 --> 00:50:39,115
-What are you talking about?
-You must have said something to him.

746
00:50:39,202 --> 00:50:40,792
You sleep in the same room.
You talk to him.

747
00:50:40,871 --> 00:50:42,961
The next night he stays out all night,
he don't come back.

748
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:45,960
-I said nothing to him.
-A priest staying out all night.

749
00:50:46,043 --> 00:50:47,463
A priest is not a priest no more,

750
00:50:47,544 --> 00:50:49,714
and he's grown up,
so he can do what he wants.

751
00:50:49,796 --> 00:50:51,626
Something you said to him.

752
00:50:51,715 --> 00:50:54,175
Oh, yeah? You try and blame me
now he ain't a priest no more?

753
00:50:54,259 --> 00:50:55,969
You been writing to him.

754
00:50:56,053 --> 00:50:59,223
I don't believe this.
You're trying to hang this on me?

755
00:51:00,557 --> 00:51:03,307
Forget it, all right?
He called. He called. He called.

756
00:51:03,393 --> 00:51:06,483
In a couple of days
he's gonna see he's wrong.

757
00:51:06,563 --> 00:51:09,483
He's going through, like,
a trial of the soul, you know?

758
00:51:09,566 --> 00:51:11,226
He's going back to the church.
He's going back.

759
00:51:11,318 --> 00:51:12,858
No, he won't.
He's not going back to the church.

760
00:51:12,944 --> 00:51:14,324
Yes he is.
He's going back to the church!

761
00:51:14,404 --> 00:51:16,164
I'm telling you, he's going back!

762
00:51:17,491 --> 00:51:19,371
You know what?
You don't got a priest no more!

763
00:51:19,451 --> 00:51:20,581
And you got no saint!

764
00:51:20,660 --> 00:51:22,750
You got nothing
but three shit children now!

765
00:51:22,829 --> 00:51:24,789
Good. Good.

766
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,130
No.

767
00:51:34,841 --> 00:51:36,471
I'm sorry, Mom.

768
00:51:38,678 --> 00:51:40,178
I just...

769
00:51:41,014 --> 00:51:44,144
I didn't mean that. I'm sorry.
I'll never say that.

770
00:51:44,226 --> 00:51:46,636
I love you, Mom. I really do.

771
00:51:47,437 --> 00:51:49,437
Go on. Get out of here.

772
00:52:02,786 --> 00:52:04,286
-How you doing, Annette?
-Okay.

773
00:52:04,371 --> 00:52:05,751
-That's good.
-Yeah.

774
00:52:05,831 --> 00:52:10,251
Hey, listen, look, Annette.
I gotta tell you something, all right?

775
00:52:10,335 --> 00:52:13,335
It's very hard to tell you this, but...

776
00:52:13,421 --> 00:52:16,471
I changed my mind
about us dancing together.

777
00:52:16,550 --> 00:52:18,470
I got another partner.

778
00:52:22,055 --> 00:52:24,635
Look, it's professional.
You know what I mean? It's like...

779
00:52:24,724 --> 00:52:27,894
Things like this happen
when it's professional.

780
00:52:28,478 --> 00:52:31,608
Oh, Jesus Christ.
My fucking mother, now you.

781
00:52:32,149 --> 00:52:34,019
Why do you hate me so much?

782
00:52:34,109 --> 00:52:36,739
All I ever did to you was like you.

783
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:39,240
Give me a break, huh?

784
00:52:54,421 --> 00:52:55,671
Hi.

785
00:52:55,755 --> 00:52:57,255
You're late.

786
00:52:57,883 --> 00:52:59,933
Five minutes. That's not late.

787
00:53:00,010 --> 00:53:01,470
How long you been here?

788
00:53:01,553 --> 00:53:03,933
I don't know.
Six, seven, something like that.

789
00:53:04,014 --> 00:53:06,394
Pete said you been here 1 5.

790
00:53:06,474 --> 00:53:08,604
Well, who's he?

791
00:53:08,685 --> 00:53:12,265
Hey, I got some records over here.
I don't know if you like them or not.

792
00:53:12,355 --> 00:53:15,565
-You like these guys?
-Yeah, yeah. Super.

793
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:19,990
Do you do the New York hustle,
the Latin hustle, what?

794
00:53:20,071 --> 00:53:22,741
-New York, Latin, I do it all.
-Okay.

795
00:53:51,519 --> 00:53:53,269
Follow me this time.

796
00:54:03,448 --> 00:54:05,948
Yeah, that's really nice.
What'd you do, make that up?

797
00:54:06,034 --> 00:54:08,914
Yeah. Yeah. No, I saw it on TV first.

798
00:54:08,995 --> 00:54:10,955
Then I made it up.

799
00:54:11,039 --> 00:54:13,119
Hey, you know what? I know this one.
What I do is...

800
00:54:13,208 --> 00:54:16,288
Wait a minute. This is simple.
Let me just check something out.

801
00:54:30,725 --> 00:54:33,765
-Come on. Come on.
-What you doing?

802
00:54:40,443 --> 00:54:42,573
Okay, stay right there.

803
00:54:52,163 --> 00:54:53,663
Now we can dance.

804
00:54:53,748 --> 00:54:55,418
Let me show you the step, okay?

805
00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:57,670
The Latin one I was
gonna show you, okay?

806
00:54:57,752 --> 00:55:01,132
Now, take your hand like this,
and count one, two, three.

807
00:55:01,214 --> 00:55:05,184
Two, two, three.
Three, two, three, kick, two, three.

808
00:55:06,469 --> 00:55:07,719
-Okay, I got that.
-Okay?

809
00:55:07,804 --> 00:55:09,564
-Looks good.
-All right.

810
00:55:16,187 --> 00:55:18,057
-That's good. I like that.
-Yeah.

811
00:55:18,148 --> 00:55:20,438
-Do you know the tango hustle?
-Yeah, yeah.

812
00:55:20,525 --> 00:55:22,435
Okay, let's try that.

813
00:56:36,851 --> 00:56:38,641
-Would you like some coffee?
-Yeah.

814
00:56:38,728 --> 00:56:41,558
No, no. Look, I really gotta go home.

815
00:56:43,691 --> 00:56:46,861
You know something?
I like you when you're like this.

816
00:56:46,945 --> 00:56:51,615
When you're quiet and you ain't laying
all that shit on me and everything.

817
00:56:51,991 --> 00:56:53,371
Oh, yeah? Well, as a matter of fact,

818
00:56:53,451 --> 00:56:55,701
guess who I had lunch with today?
Paul Anka.

819
00:56:55,787 --> 00:56:57,407
I had to open my big mouth, right?

820
00:56:57,497 --> 00:57:00,207
It was very interesting.
Very interesting. Very interesting.

821
00:57:00,291 --> 00:57:02,461
Very, very intelligent fellow.

822
00:57:02,544 --> 00:57:05,254
You cream over that word,
"interesting," don't you?

823
00:57:05,338 --> 00:57:07,838
-Well, what's wrong with "interesting"?
-I don't know, something.

824
00:57:07,924 --> 00:57:09,094
You know, I want to tell you something.

825
00:57:09,175 --> 00:57:12,215
I've never told you this before,
but I think you're full of shit.

826
00:57:12,303 --> 00:57:14,933
-Oh, you do, do you, huh?
-Yeah, except I'm not sure.

827
00:57:15,014 --> 00:57:17,724
I'm not sure how much is just shit
and how much is bullshit.

828
00:57:17,809 --> 00:57:21,769
Well, listen, when you figure it out,
just let me know, all right?

829
00:57:23,773 --> 00:57:26,233
We should really practise
a couple more times.

830
00:57:26,317 --> 00:57:28,487
Maybe go to 2001 with a crowd.

831
00:57:28,570 --> 00:57:30,740
How about Saturday?
Would that be good?

832
00:57:30,822 --> 00:57:32,162
Maybe.

833
00:57:33,032 --> 00:57:36,332
Stephanie, I wanna
ask you something, all right?

834
00:57:37,036 --> 00:57:39,406
I don't know how to say this.

835
00:57:42,208 --> 00:57:45,628
Do you think that I am
either interesting or intelligent?

836
00:57:47,755 --> 00:57:50,045
Interesting? Yeah. Yeah.

837
00:57:50,133 --> 00:57:51,723
Intelligent?

838
00:57:53,636 --> 00:57:55,546
I don't know. Maybe.

839
00:57:56,764 --> 00:57:58,524
I don't know. I gotta know you better.
You know what I mean?

840
00:57:58,600 --> 00:58:00,480
You got a way of putting things together,
you know?

841
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:02,230
Seeing things a certain way.

842
00:58:02,312 --> 00:58:04,612
Interesting? Yeah, yeah.

843
00:58:04,689 --> 00:58:08,649
Intelligent? Yeah, maybe.
Maybe intelligent.

844
00:58:08,735 --> 00:58:10,605
Well, what do you know?

845
00:58:11,946 --> 00:58:13,316
All right.

846
00:58:13,406 --> 00:58:16,236
Hey, Stephanie,
how come we never talk

847
00:58:16,326 --> 00:58:17,776
about how we feel when we're dancing?

848
00:58:17,869 --> 00:58:20,909
-How come we never talk about that?
-Good night and thanks.

849
00:58:20,997 --> 00:58:23,247
No, maybe I could walk you
the rest of the way.

850
00:58:23,333 --> 00:58:25,293
-Let me do that.
-Nope.

851
00:58:28,004 --> 00:58:31,174
You shouldn't have asked.
You should have just done it.

852
00:58:31,257 --> 00:58:33,297
Oh, hot stuff, Jesus.

853
00:59:16,636 --> 00:59:19,046
-Hey, what's happening, Tony?
-Bob, what's up? My brother, Frank.

854
00:59:19,138 --> 00:59:20,928
Hey, how you doing? Double J.

855
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:32,280
Hey, how you doing?

856
00:59:34,195 --> 00:59:36,735
-Come on up to the table over there.
-Oh, okay.

857
00:59:54,132 --> 00:59:55,882
You guys have the Moses effect.

858
00:59:55,967 --> 00:59:58,927
You arrive
and the crowd parts like the Red Sea.

859
00:59:59,012 --> 01:00:00,682
They know we're the faces, that's all.

860
01:00:00,763 --> 01:00:03,973
-How do you like it, Father?
-What father? I look like your father?

861
01:00:04,058 --> 01:00:07,558
Please don't call me that.
I never could stand that.

862
01:00:07,645 --> 01:00:10,435
But, yeah, I think the place is,
you know, energising.

863
01:00:10,523 --> 01:00:13,153
-It's all right, huh?
-Great.

864
01:00:13,234 --> 01:00:14,404
Good place.

865
01:00:23,620 --> 01:00:25,500
-Tony.
-Hey.

866
01:00:25,913 --> 01:00:27,163
Hey.

867
01:00:27,498 --> 01:00:30,878
Are you as good in bed
as you are on that dance floor?

868
01:00:33,004 --> 01:00:34,634
Well, are you?

869
01:00:35,131 --> 01:00:37,761
Are you as good in bed
as you are on the dance floor?

870
01:00:37,842 --> 01:00:41,092
-Hey, he never made it in a bed.
-Watch this.

871
01:00:41,179 --> 01:00:44,139
This ain't my regular partner,
but you'll see.

872
01:00:47,101 --> 01:00:49,481
Ton, what are you gonna have to drink?
We'll get you something, huh?

873
01:00:49,562 --> 01:00:52,152
-Seven and Seven.
-Seven and Seven.

874
01:01:08,831 --> 01:01:11,711
So, when's Connie
gonna get her answer, huh?

875
01:01:13,044 --> 01:01:15,304
-You know, Connie.
-Yeah.

876
01:01:15,380 --> 01:01:17,840
If you're as good in bed
as you are on the dance floor,

877
01:01:17,924 --> 01:01:20,684
I'll bet you're one lousy fuck.

878
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:24,180
So, how come they always send me
flowers the next day, huh?

879
01:01:24,263 --> 01:01:26,433
You know, some guys don't know
a lousy fuck when they got one.

880
01:01:26,516 --> 01:01:29,096
-You know what I mean?
-Oh, yeah?

881
01:01:29,185 --> 01:01:31,225
Maybe they thought you was dead.

882
01:01:31,312 --> 01:01:33,812
Father, wanna hear something? Listen.

883
01:01:33,898 --> 01:01:36,858
I got a girlfriend of mine, you know.
She's such a good Catholic, Father.

884
01:01:36,943 --> 01:01:40,203
She tells me she loves the taste
of communion wafers.

885
01:01:42,573 --> 01:01:44,413
Hey, Mr Manero,
could I talk to you for a sec?

886
01:01:44,492 --> 01:01:45,912
-Hey, what's he doing?
-Frank.

887
01:01:45,993 --> 01:01:47,083
Frank, yeah, Frank, yeah. Listen...

888
01:01:49,080 --> 01:01:50,790
Oh, forget this.

889
01:01:51,749 --> 01:01:55,169
Look out. Give the kid some room.
He's taking over again.

890
01:01:55,253 --> 01:01:56,423
-All right!
-All right!

891
01:01:56,504 --> 01:01:57,714
Go, go!

892
01:02:02,385 --> 01:02:03,585
Right on.

893
01:02:09,892 --> 01:02:11,392
There he goes.

894
01:02:12,603 --> 01:02:15,023
-Okay, babe.
-There he goes.

895
01:03:44,821 --> 01:03:46,281
Go, Tony!

896
01:03:48,533 --> 01:03:49,783
Yeah!

897
01:04:06,801 --> 01:04:08,181
All right.

898
01:04:12,890 --> 01:04:16,390
-He's very good, yeah.
-He's the king out there, Father.

899
01:04:17,436 --> 01:04:19,766
-He's the best.
-Hey, man, he's great. He's great.

900
01:04:19,856 --> 01:04:21,396
You know, man?

901
01:04:27,905 --> 01:04:29,525
Listen, can I talk to you
for a second, Father?

902
01:04:29,615 --> 01:04:31,155
Yes, but call me Frank.

903
01:04:31,242 --> 01:04:35,002
Frank? Frank, listen. Come here.
You wanna hear something? Listen.

904
01:04:35,079 --> 01:04:37,749
I got... My girlfriend, you know...
Can I tell you something?

905
01:04:37,832 --> 01:04:39,252
-Yeah.
-Come here for a sec.

906
01:04:39,333 --> 01:04:41,843
Listen, Frank. Wanna hear something?

907
01:04:41,919 --> 01:04:44,919
I got a lot of ideas. You see, like,
I was reading up about the Pope.

908
01:04:45,006 --> 01:04:46,716
-Hey, Father?
-Yeah, sure. Frank, Frank.

909
01:04:46,799 --> 01:04:48,679
Frank. Yeah, Frank. Yeah, Frank.

910
01:04:48,759 --> 01:04:52,799
Okay, Frank. Listen, Frank,
I got a girlfriend, you know?

911
01:04:52,889 --> 01:04:54,639
She's Pauline.
Her name's Pauline. And...

912
01:04:54,724 --> 01:04:57,064
Yeah. What do you mean, you got her...

913
01:04:57,143 --> 01:04:58,983
Did you get her pregnant?

914
01:04:59,061 --> 01:05:01,521
Yes, I did. Yes. Yes, I did.

915
01:05:02,523 --> 01:05:04,483
She loves the taste
of communion wafers.

916
01:05:04,567 --> 01:05:07,647
Well, I got a lot of ideas, you know,
swimming around in my head.

917
01:05:07,737 --> 01:05:09,737
And I was reading a lot of stuff lately.

918
01:05:09,822 --> 01:05:13,832
I heard, like, the Pope, he gives special,

919
01:05:13,910 --> 01:05:15,790
-you know...
-Dispensation.

920
01:05:15,870 --> 01:05:20,120
Yeah. Do you think the Pope
could give Pauline an abortion?

921
01:05:20,207 --> 01:05:22,667
You mean give you
a dispensation for an abortion?

922
01:05:22,752 --> 01:05:25,342
Yeah, you think you could do this?

923
01:05:26,172 --> 01:05:27,802
I don't think so, Bobby.

924
01:05:27,882 --> 01:05:30,222
Well, maybe, you know,
maybe you could do it for me.

925
01:05:30,301 --> 01:05:33,391
-Maybe?
-I'm sorry, Bobby. I don't think so.

926
01:05:33,471 --> 01:05:34,721
I was just thinking.

927
01:05:34,805 --> 01:05:36,765
Have you talked to your priest about it?

928
01:05:36,849 --> 01:05:39,729
Yeah, I talk to everybody about it.

929
01:05:39,810 --> 01:05:42,190
I talked to a lot of people.
A lot of people. A lot of people.

930
01:05:42,271 --> 01:05:44,861
All right, thank you.
Thanks a lot. All right?

931
01:05:44,941 --> 01:05:47,981
You play, you pay. It's funny, huh?

932
01:05:50,321 --> 01:05:54,031
Don"t forget, everybody.
You could win, too, man.

933
01:05:54,158 --> 01:05:56,948
Disco Universe sweepstakes,
just a week away.

934
01:05:57,036 --> 01:05:58,866
500 bucks. 500 big ones.

935
01:05:58,955 --> 01:06:01,365
-Do you know Stephanie Mangano?
-No.

936
01:06:01,457 --> 01:06:03,287
-No?
-I know Stephanie.

937
01:06:03,376 --> 01:06:05,956
-Did she come in yet?
-No, she didn't get in yet.

938
01:06:06,045 --> 01:06:07,835
-You sure?
-Yeah, I'm sure.

939
01:06:10,967 --> 01:06:13,467
Right, right. Don"t forget again, baby,

940
01:06:13,552 --> 01:06:15,892
UniversaI Disco sweepstakes,
just a week away.

941
01:06:16,013 --> 01:06:17,813
Tony! Tony, that was really great.

942
01:06:17,890 --> 01:06:19,140
-Oh, you liked it?
-Yeah.

943
01:06:19,225 --> 01:06:20,555
Listen, I'm gonna go home now.
All right?

944
01:06:20,685 --> 01:06:22,225
-You're gonna go home?
-Yeah.

945
01:06:22,353 --> 01:06:25,653
No, no, stay a little longer, Frank.
The night's just beginning.

946
01:06:25,731 --> 01:06:28,401
Yeah, I know,
but it's not my scene, you know?

947
01:06:28,526 --> 01:06:30,896
Come on. You didn't expect me
to stay the whole night, did you?

948
01:06:31,028 --> 01:06:32,648
No, no. I didn't...

949
01:06:32,738 --> 01:06:36,238
Yes, I thought maybe
you'd stay a little longer.

950
01:06:36,325 --> 01:06:39,075
-No, it's not your scene. Of course not.
-I'm sorry, Tony.

951
01:06:39,203 --> 01:06:41,163
Don't worry about it.
It's nothing, you know.

952
01:06:41,247 --> 01:06:42,997
So what, right? Come on.

953
01:06:43,082 --> 01:06:45,172
I'll walk you to the door.

954
01:06:45,251 --> 01:06:49,251
Hey, you know,
your dancing is really marvellous.

955
01:06:49,380 --> 01:06:52,260
It's exciting. I mean, it's exciting
to watch you out there.

956
01:06:52,383 --> 01:06:55,013
They can't keep their eyes off of you.

957
01:06:55,428 --> 01:06:56,848
Look, I got to go now, okay?
I'll see you later.

958
01:06:56,929 --> 01:06:59,099
All right, well, have a good night.
I'll see you later. All right?

959
01:06:59,223 --> 01:07:00,433
Yeah, you, too.

960
01:07:00,558 --> 01:07:02,268
Hey, she come in or what?

961
01:07:02,351 --> 01:07:05,601
Hey, you just asked me,
and I told you she isn't here.

962
01:07:13,404 --> 01:07:16,204
-Tony, your brother, is he okay?
-He's fine.

963
01:07:16,282 --> 01:07:19,282
He just had a stomach thing.
I don't know.

964
01:07:29,628 --> 01:07:31,248
Just the two of them.

965
01:07:36,302 --> 01:07:38,222
-We could make it now.
-What?

966
01:07:38,304 --> 01:07:40,564
We ain't practising,
seeing each other like you said,

967
01:07:40,639 --> 01:07:41,809
so we could make it.

968
01:07:41,932 --> 01:07:44,392
Look, Annette, we make it
when I decide, all right?

969
01:07:44,477 --> 01:07:45,557
No other time.

970
01:07:45,644 --> 01:07:47,154
-All right.
-When I say so, all right?

971
01:07:47,229 --> 01:07:49,399
I'll just make it with somebody else.

972
01:07:49,482 --> 01:07:51,402
Who? Who?

973
01:07:51,484 --> 01:07:53,744
Somebody. I don't care. Anybody here.

974
01:07:53,819 --> 01:07:56,069
-Oh, somebody here?
-Yeah.

975
01:07:56,155 --> 01:07:58,405
Double J, Joey.

976
01:07:58,491 --> 01:08:00,581
Oh, the fuck you will.
Hey, look. Hey, Bobby.

977
01:08:00,659 --> 01:08:02,329
Look, we're gonna go out to the car,

978
01:08:02,453 --> 01:08:05,793
and when I get back,
we'll go to the bridge, all right?

979
01:08:09,418 --> 01:08:10,788
You fixed?

980
01:08:12,088 --> 01:08:13,248
Huh?

981
01:08:13,339 --> 01:08:15,589
-You fixed?
-What do you mean?

982
01:08:16,675 --> 01:08:19,675
-You know, are you on the pill or what?
-No.

983
01:08:20,346 --> 01:08:21,506
No?

984
01:08:22,848 --> 01:08:25,598
What do you got, the lOU, that thing?

985
01:08:25,851 --> 01:08:27,811
-Huh?
-No.

986
01:08:28,854 --> 01:08:30,364
No diaphragm?

987
01:08:31,023 --> 01:08:32,523
-Nothing?
-It doesn't matter, though.

988
01:08:32,650 --> 01:08:35,110
-You don't got nothing?
-It doesn't matter. Tony, I love you.

989
01:08:35,194 --> 01:08:36,614
Are you kidding me?

990
01:08:36,695 --> 01:08:38,775
Oh, forget it. Oh, fuck.

991
01:08:38,864 --> 01:08:41,624
Just give me a blowjob.
Ready? Come on.

992
01:08:45,579 --> 01:08:47,499
-Just a minute.
-Hey, Tony!

993
01:08:47,581 --> 01:08:50,581
Forget it. Forget it. Just fix yourself up.

994
01:08:51,043 --> 01:08:52,843
Everything was cool.
Everything was all right.

995
01:08:52,920 --> 01:08:54,750
You had a good time.

996
01:09:07,226 --> 01:09:09,096
Annette, cigarette?

997
01:09:12,022 --> 01:09:13,612
Guess not, huh?

998
01:09:52,062 --> 01:09:53,652
Stupid goofs.

999
01:10:07,953 --> 01:10:11,793
Hey, Annette, can you dig it?
I knew that you could.

1000
01:10:20,925 --> 01:10:23,465
-Joey!
-You're fucked, Double J.

1001
01:10:24,178 --> 01:10:25,638
-Hey, Tony.
-What?

1002
01:10:25,763 --> 01:10:28,063
Come on.
Let's get this selfish motherfucker.

1003
01:10:28,140 --> 01:10:29,810
-All right.
-Let's push him off.

1004
01:10:29,934 --> 01:10:32,644
-All right.
-You're going in, you big, fucking hump!

1005
01:10:36,357 --> 01:10:38,647
Come on, Ton. Let's get him.

1006
01:10:40,986 --> 01:10:43,146
Come on. Let's go. Shit.

1007
01:10:44,156 --> 01:10:47,026
Hey, come on, let's get the fucking
show off and throw him the fuck off.

1008
01:10:47,159 --> 01:10:48,529
Hey, Tarzan!

1009
01:10:55,668 --> 01:10:57,378
Look out, Double J!

1010
01:10:59,296 --> 01:11:01,546
Don't worry about nothing! I'm coming!

1011
01:11:06,845 --> 01:11:08,175
You fuckers!

1012
01:11:08,305 --> 01:11:11,845
-Can you dig it? I knew that you could.
-I knew that you could.

1013
01:11:14,853 --> 01:11:16,563
You stupid bitch.

1014
01:11:28,200 --> 01:11:30,580
I wish you was staying longer,
you know, Frank?

1015
01:11:30,703 --> 01:11:33,163
Ex-priests don't stay back home.

1016
01:11:33,247 --> 01:11:35,957
Listen, everyone's too shocked
and disgraced.

1017
01:11:36,041 --> 01:11:37,211
A family raises a priest,

1018
01:11:37,334 --> 01:11:38,714
they think
they've scored points in heaven,

1019
01:11:38,836 --> 01:11:41,046
-and now they're gonna lose them.
-Hey, Frank. How you doing?

1020
01:11:41,171 --> 01:11:44,721
Okay. We better get a move on.
I gotta pick some people on the way.

1021
01:11:44,842 --> 01:11:47,892
Okay. Listen, we gotta keep in touch.

1022
01:11:48,012 --> 01:11:49,642
Yeah. You gonna like
this settlement house?

1023
01:11:49,722 --> 01:11:50,892
What do you think?

1024
01:11:51,015 --> 01:11:53,305
-It'll do until I figure out my next move.
-Yeah.

1025
01:11:53,392 --> 01:11:55,482
-What about you?
-What about me?

1026
01:11:55,561 --> 01:11:57,481
Are you gonna do something
with your dancing, Tony?

1027
01:11:57,563 --> 01:11:59,483
I don't know.
People ask me all the time.

1028
01:11:59,565 --> 01:12:02,895
But I don't know, I mean, you know,
I feel like my whole life, right,

1029
01:12:03,027 --> 01:12:05,897
I've been told I'm the no-good
in the family and that...

1030
01:12:06,030 --> 01:12:11,080
Tony, the only way you're gonna survive
is to do what you think is right,

1031
01:12:11,201 --> 01:12:14,251
not what they keep trying
to jam you into.

1032
01:12:14,371 --> 01:12:18,121
You let them do that and you're
gonna end up nothing but miserable.

1033
01:12:18,250 --> 01:12:19,540
Huh?

1034
01:12:23,589 --> 01:12:26,509
-Hey, have a good trip, all right?
-Yeah.

1035
01:12:28,093 --> 01:12:30,093
I left you something in your room.

1036
01:12:30,262 --> 01:12:32,432
-What did you leave me?
-A souvenir.

1037
01:12:33,682 --> 01:12:34,932
Money?

1038
01:12:36,435 --> 01:12:38,095
Leave me money.

1039
01:13:18,936 --> 01:13:20,556
So, what are you standing there for?

1040
01:13:20,646 --> 01:13:22,646
How come you wasn't there
Saturday night?

1041
01:13:22,731 --> 01:13:25,151
I didn't say I was gonna be there
Saturday night.

1042
01:13:25,234 --> 01:13:28,824
-The fuck you didn't.
-I said maybe. Maybe's a maybe.

1043
01:13:28,904 --> 01:13:30,994
I didn't think you'd go
and get upset about it.

1044
01:13:31,073 --> 01:13:34,413
Oh, forget upset. I'm not upset.
It's just that we needed the practise.

1045
01:13:34,493 --> 01:13:35,993
I mean, you know,
you should've been there.

1046
01:13:36,120 --> 01:13:38,910
All right, right, let's practise then.

1047
01:13:40,916 --> 01:13:42,076
We can't.

1048
01:13:42,167 --> 01:13:44,917
I didn't bring the records 'cause
I didn't think you was gonna be here.

1049
01:13:45,003 --> 01:13:47,673
Yeah? So what did you come for, huh?

1050
01:13:51,260 --> 01:13:55,510
-Stugats. You know "stugats"?
-Yeah, I know "stugats."

1051
01:13:55,597 --> 01:13:57,097
All right, we'll use some of this stuff.

1052
01:13:57,182 --> 01:14:00,182
"If you're not of a mind to break up..."

1053
01:14:01,478 --> 01:14:02,768
What's up?

1054
01:14:02,855 --> 01:14:04,685
We've been waiting, man.

1055
01:14:04,815 --> 01:14:06,605
Pete said you was practising, you know.

1056
01:14:06,692 --> 01:14:09,532
Hey, Tony, we were cruising
you know who. Looking good.

1057
01:14:09,653 --> 01:14:12,363
Not now. Don't talk about it now.
Talk about it later.

1058
01:14:12,448 --> 01:14:16,028
Stephanie, this is Joey,
this is Double J, this is Bobby C.

1059
01:14:16,118 --> 01:14:18,288
-How you doing, Stephanie?
-How do you do?

1060
01:14:18,370 --> 01:14:20,120
-You a dancer?
-Yeah.

1061
01:14:20,205 --> 01:14:22,115
-You hungry?
-Yeah.

1062
01:14:22,207 --> 01:14:24,037
What do you wanna eat, huh?

1063
01:14:26,378 --> 01:14:28,878
-I'm gonna change and then...
-All right.

1064
01:14:29,798 --> 01:14:32,878
What maracas. She's got maracas.
She's got nice tits.

1065
01:14:35,053 --> 01:14:36,553
It's like,
I'm gonna be travelling, you know.

1066
01:14:36,638 --> 01:14:38,888
Promotional tours
with authors and performers.

1067
01:14:39,016 --> 01:14:41,136
Of course, I'm gonna hate
to leave Manhattan, even briefly.

1068
01:14:41,226 --> 01:14:44,306
There's certain ballets and concerts
I'm just gonna have to miss.

1069
01:14:44,396 --> 01:14:46,226
Tell them about the people
who come into the office.

1070
01:14:46,315 --> 01:14:47,815
That's what they wanna hear.
Tell them that.

1071
01:14:47,900 --> 01:14:50,900
Oh, you know who came in today?
This guy, David Bowie.

1072
01:14:51,028 --> 01:14:53,738
-He comes in, has this Astrakhan coat...
-He's a faggot.

1073
01:14:53,822 --> 01:14:57,492
-He's a half-faggot, man.
-Hey, relax! Come on. Sit down.

1074
01:14:57,576 --> 01:14:59,406
You mean, he's a bisexual.

1075
01:14:59,536 --> 01:15:02,656
Yeah, he swings both ways.
Men and boys.

1076
01:15:02,748 --> 01:15:04,668
-What's so funny?
-Oh, yeah?

1077
01:15:04,750 --> 01:15:08,170
Well, you know who came in today?
Joe Namath. You know Joe Namath?

1078
01:15:08,253 --> 01:15:10,173
He comes in
and he wants some coffee,

1079
01:15:10,255 --> 01:15:11,335
so I brought him coffee.

1080
01:15:11,423 --> 01:15:13,593
And then he asked me to sit down,
have some coffee with him.

1081
01:15:13,717 --> 01:15:14,837
You had coffee with Joe Namath?

1082
01:15:14,927 --> 01:15:17,177
Yeah, that's right.
We were talking a little bit.

1083
01:15:17,262 --> 01:15:20,102
He wanted to know
what it was like to be 21 .

1084
01:15:20,224 --> 01:15:22,604
I told him I didn't know
'cause I was just 20.

1085
01:15:22,726 --> 01:15:25,266
-Yeah, what else?
-That's all.

1086
01:15:25,354 --> 01:15:26,444
Ain't that enough?

1087
01:15:26,563 --> 01:15:28,773
Hey, don't you never chew, Tony?
Don't you never chew?

1088
01:15:28,857 --> 01:15:31,437
Hey, look, when my mother dies,
I'll give you the job, all right?

1089
01:15:31,568 --> 01:15:32,938
You know what's going
down your throat, man?

1090
01:15:33,028 --> 01:15:34,358
Big chunks of hamburger, you know.

1091
01:15:34,446 --> 01:15:37,366
Big gobs, like dog food,
dog friskies, dog yummies.

1092
01:15:37,449 --> 01:15:40,539
You know something, Joey?
He's gonna turn into a dog.

1093
01:15:55,467 --> 01:15:58,137
Stephanie, listen,
can I talk to you for a second?

1094
01:15:58,220 --> 01:15:59,800
I was listening
to what you said in there before,

1095
01:15:59,888 --> 01:16:04,638
and you seem to know a lot of people,
and a lot of places and a lot of things.

1096
01:16:04,726 --> 01:16:06,226
I got a friend of mine, you know,

1097
01:16:06,311 --> 01:16:09,901
he's a very good friend of mine
and he got a girl pregnant.

1098
01:16:09,982 --> 01:16:12,232
He got a girl pregnant,
and I wanted to know

1099
01:16:12,317 --> 01:16:14,147
if you had to make a choice

1100
01:16:14,236 --> 01:16:16,736
between getting an abortion
and have to get married to somebody,

1101
01:16:16,822 --> 01:16:18,322
what would you do?

1102
01:16:18,448 --> 01:16:20,658
Well, who would I have to marry?

1103
01:16:21,827 --> 01:16:25,077
You'd have to marry me.
You'd have to marry me. Yeah.

1104
01:16:25,163 --> 01:16:27,673
I think I'd get an abortion.
Hey, so long, Tony.

1105
01:16:27,749 --> 01:16:29,959
It's very nice meeting you.

1106
01:16:30,752 --> 01:16:32,092
So, what'd you guys think of her?

1107
01:16:32,170 --> 01:16:35,090
Hey, Tony, I liked her.
I thought she was nice. I liked her a lot.

1108
01:16:35,173 --> 01:16:37,343
She's a snotty bitch, man.

1109
01:16:37,968 --> 01:16:40,428
She's cool.
You just gotta get to know her, that's all.

1110
01:16:40,512 --> 01:16:42,512
Hey, Ton, did you fuck her, yet?

1111
01:16:42,639 --> 01:16:44,519
-What do you think?
-I don't think so.

1112
01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:47,350
You know, you guys got a lot
of growing up to do, you know that?

1113
01:16:47,477 --> 01:16:49,977
A lot of growing up. You're babies.

1114
01:16:50,439 --> 01:16:52,019
Yeah.

1115
01:16:52,357 --> 01:16:55,857
Hey, Mr Fusco, look,
I need the afternoon off.

1116
01:16:55,944 --> 01:16:58,784
Sam's out. Harold's sick.
Here, take these.

1117
01:16:58,864 --> 01:17:01,704
-But I gotta, Mr Fusco.
-Sorry, Tony.

1118
01:17:01,783 --> 01:17:03,953
Look, all I'm asking for
is one afternoon off.

1119
01:17:04,036 --> 01:17:06,286
I've been here almost eight months.
I didn't miss a day yet!

1120
01:17:06,371 --> 01:17:09,371
-Not today, Tony.
-Oh, come on, Mr Fusco.

1121
01:17:09,458 --> 01:17:11,878
Some of those old farts,
they miss three, four days at a time,

1122
01:17:11,960 --> 01:17:13,130
you don't say nothing to them.

1123
01:17:13,211 --> 01:17:14,801
Hey, cool off.

1124
01:17:14,880 --> 01:17:17,380
Look, I got to have the afternoon off.
I'm taking it.

1125
01:17:17,507 --> 01:17:19,797
-You do, you're fired.
-I'm doing it.

1126
01:17:19,885 --> 01:17:23,215
-Then you're fired!
-Then fuck you, asshole!

1127
01:17:24,056 --> 01:17:26,216
And the fuck horse you rode in on.

1128
01:17:26,350 --> 01:17:27,980
-Fucking cocksucker asshole!
-Tony.

1129
01:17:28,060 --> 01:17:31,060
Tony, I don't wanna marry Pauline.
I don't give a fuck about this cunt.

1130
01:17:31,188 --> 01:17:34,068
-So, don't marry her!
-Tony, I gotta marry her!

1131
01:17:34,149 --> 01:17:35,729
Fuck it. She won't get the abortion.

1132
01:17:35,859 --> 01:17:38,569
-Everyone says I gotta marry her, Tony.
-Who says that?

1133
01:17:38,695 --> 01:17:41,065
Oh, fuck, her fucking parents,
my fucking parents.

1134
01:17:41,198 --> 01:17:43,158
The fucking priest on the corner.

1135
01:17:43,241 --> 01:17:45,991
Her fucking high school
guidance counsellor.

1136
01:17:46,078 --> 01:17:48,498
Tony, I'm paralysed.
I got no more control.

1137
01:17:48,580 --> 01:17:51,000
I mean, you and me, Tony,
we've been friends for so long.

1138
01:17:51,083 --> 01:17:53,083
I mean, I'm hurting.

1139
01:17:54,169 --> 01:17:57,169
Shit! You're always together.

1140
01:17:57,255 --> 01:18:00,085
And I'm always fucking up,
and you're always all right. You know?

1141
01:18:00,175 --> 01:18:03,675
l... Oh, come on.
Everybody fucks up. Really.

1142
01:18:03,762 --> 01:18:06,432
-Don't worry about nothing.
-You know, you're great.

1143
01:18:06,556 --> 01:18:08,846
I'm in a terrible rush.
I hate to leave you like this.

1144
01:18:08,934 --> 01:18:10,694
You got no idea
how much I appreciate this.

1145
01:18:10,769 --> 01:18:12,689
I mean, this car's very important
for me today, you know?

1146
01:18:12,771 --> 01:18:14,521
-Will you call me tonight?
-Yeah, I'll call you.

1147
01:18:14,606 --> 01:18:16,606
Don't worry about nothing, all right?
Take care.

1148
01:18:16,692 --> 01:18:19,362
-I'll talk to you later then?
-Yeah.

1149
01:18:19,444 --> 01:18:21,614
-Call me tonight, right?
-Yeah.

1150
01:18:21,697 --> 01:18:23,947
You're gonna call me tonight?

1151
01:18:57,983 --> 01:19:00,483
You know, Stephanie, this got me fired.

1152
01:19:00,610 --> 01:19:02,400
-What?
-This got me fired.

1153
01:19:02,487 --> 01:19:06,407
You know, you couldn't do it on Sunday,
so, my boss, he fired me.

1154
01:19:06,491 --> 01:19:08,491
Well, I just wanted
to get everything in, you know,

1155
01:19:08,577 --> 01:19:10,407
so I could start fixing up
when I move in on Saturday.

1156
01:19:10,495 --> 01:19:11,655
Yeah.

1157
01:19:11,747 --> 01:19:14,747
Nobody bitched at my office.
I got the whole day off.

1158
01:19:16,918 --> 01:19:18,338
Hey, I'm sorry.

1159
01:19:18,462 --> 01:19:21,762
Oh, it's all right. No problem.
No big deal. I can handle it.

1160
01:20:23,902 --> 01:20:26,322
Yeah, come on in.

1161
01:20:26,404 --> 01:20:29,074
Now, put that over here.

1162
01:20:29,866 --> 01:20:31,026
Hey!

1163
01:20:31,910 --> 01:20:33,580
I thought you were
gonna be out of town.

1164
01:20:33,703 --> 01:20:35,583
I postponed the trip.

1165
01:20:39,084 --> 01:20:41,844
Jay, this is Tony Manero. He's a friend.

1166
01:20:41,920 --> 01:20:45,170
-Tony, this is Jay Langhart.
-Unspecified status.

1167
01:20:45,257 --> 01:20:47,167
How do you do?

1168
01:20:47,259 --> 01:20:49,839
Well, I've decided to leave you
all the furniture.

1169
01:20:49,928 --> 01:20:52,008
What, are you kidding?
You're not gonna take any of this stuff?

1170
01:20:52,097 --> 01:20:54,847
No, I'm gonna start fresh. What the hell,
you picked out most of it anyway.

1171
01:20:54,933 --> 01:20:57,523
-Well, super.
-Stephanie, I told you not to say "super."

1172
01:20:57,602 --> 01:21:00,352
Nobody says "super' any more.

1173
01:21:00,438 --> 01:21:03,688
Can I get you a beer? Glass of wine?

1174
01:21:03,775 --> 01:21:06,185
No, man, it's all right.

1175
01:21:06,278 --> 01:21:08,608
Hey, I read that book you told me to.
You know, the...

1176
01:21:08,697 --> 01:21:10,527
Kerr or the Lawson?

1177
01:21:10,615 --> 01:21:13,615
-The Kerr.
-Should have read the Lawson.

1178
01:21:14,953 --> 01:21:19,293
Listen, if I can help you guys move in,
you just say the word. Be glad to help.

1179
01:21:27,716 --> 01:21:30,086
I'll get the rest of the stuff.

1180
01:21:41,313 --> 01:21:43,653
Stephanie, who is that guy?

1181
01:21:43,732 --> 01:21:47,652
He's an arranger, a record producer.
He wants to do films.

1182
01:21:47,777 --> 01:21:50,487
He's gonna move now
to a more expensive apartment.

1183
01:21:50,614 --> 01:21:52,574
I met him at the agency.

1184
01:21:52,657 --> 01:21:54,827
He didn't want his wife
to know how much money he had

1185
01:21:54,910 --> 01:21:57,160
until the divorce was final.

1186
01:21:58,330 --> 01:21:59,500
Come on. Let's go.

1187
01:21:59,581 --> 01:22:03,461
I mean, who is he to you, Stephanie?
That's what I'm talking about.

1188
01:22:04,628 --> 01:22:07,498
He's a friend of mine, okay?
He's a friend.

1189
01:22:08,465 --> 01:22:11,505
And I was living with him
for a little while.

1190
01:22:11,635 --> 01:22:14,005
Are you in love with this man or what?
I mean, tell me the story.

1191
01:22:14,095 --> 01:22:17,255
-That's all I'm asking, is the story.
-No, I'm not. We had a thing.

1192
01:22:17,349 --> 01:22:19,599
You know?
It didn't work out, and it's over now,

1193
01:22:19,684 --> 01:22:21,774
and he's my friend, and he still likes me.

1194
01:22:21,853 --> 01:22:23,523
He likes you. He likes you to have...

1195
01:22:23,647 --> 01:22:25,937
To have you around for a quick piece
when he feels like it.

1196
01:22:26,024 --> 01:22:28,614
He helped me, man. You don't know
what it's like at that place.

1197
01:22:28,693 --> 01:22:31,113
It's crazy. You don't know shit!

1198
01:22:31,196 --> 01:22:35,116
You know? I didn't know how to do stuff,
so I'd go to him and I would ask him,

1199
01:22:35,200 --> 01:22:37,280
and he would tell me how to do things.

1200
01:22:37,369 --> 01:22:39,699
And then I'd go back to work
and everything would be all right.

1201
01:22:39,788 --> 01:22:41,618
Otherwise, I'd be walking around
like an idiot,

1202
01:22:41,706 --> 01:22:43,866
going, "I don't know. I don't know.
I don't know."

1203
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:45,960
-And he helps me. He does.
-Yeah, he helps you. Helps you what?

1204
01:22:46,044 --> 01:22:48,554
Get in and out of the sack?
Is that what he helps you do?

1205
01:22:48,630 --> 01:22:50,130
-He helped me.
-Sure.

1206
01:22:50,215 --> 01:22:52,545
What the hell do you
expect me to do, man?

1207
01:22:52,634 --> 01:22:55,644
What do you expect me to do?
He helped me.

1208
01:23:05,188 --> 01:23:07,898
Don't cry about it. I mean, you know.

1209
01:23:07,983 --> 01:23:11,033
All right, so he helped you.
That's good for you.

1210
01:23:14,823 --> 01:23:17,573
All right. Come on. Let's get out of here.

1211
01:23:18,535 --> 01:23:19,905
I'm sorry.

1212
01:23:21,538 --> 01:23:23,498
It's all right. Don't worry about nothing.

1213
01:23:23,581 --> 01:23:26,671
Don't worry about that.
Don't worry about nothing.

1214
01:23:26,751 --> 01:23:28,541
Stephanie, don't.

1215
01:23:30,046 --> 01:23:32,416
Look, we'll stop here for a while.
We'll sit down. All right?

1216
01:23:32,549 --> 01:23:34,759
Don't stop. Just take me home.
Just take me home, man.

1217
01:23:34,884 --> 01:23:36,594
No, come on, we'll sit here
for a while, all right?

1218
01:23:36,678 --> 01:23:39,098
Just, don't worry about nothing.

1219
01:23:45,437 --> 01:23:47,347
It's pretty, isn't it?

1220
01:23:54,446 --> 01:23:55,946
Sit down.

1221
01:24:08,084 --> 01:24:10,294
You know how tall that bridge is?

1222
01:24:10,378 --> 01:24:13,878
That bridge, that tower right there,
goes up 690 feet.

1223
01:24:14,591 --> 01:24:17,971
They got 40 million cars
going across there a year.

1224
01:24:18,303 --> 01:24:22,643
127,000 tons of steel is involved in that.

1225
01:24:23,641 --> 01:24:24,891
The concrete there,

1226
01:24:24,976 --> 01:24:28,976
they got almost three-quarter
of a million yards of concrete.

1227
01:24:29,064 --> 01:24:30,154
That's right.

1228
01:24:30,273 --> 01:24:34,903
The centre span, right there,
is 4,260 feet long.

1229
01:24:34,986 --> 01:24:37,736
And with the on-ramps,
it all together totals, like,

1230
01:24:37,822 --> 01:24:40,242
something like 2.5 miles.

1231
01:24:41,659 --> 01:24:44,079
You know all about the bridge,
don't you?

1232
01:24:44,162 --> 01:24:46,002
That's right.

1233
01:24:46,122 --> 01:24:48,502
I know everything about that bridge.

1234
01:24:48,583 --> 01:24:52,633
You know what else?
They got a guy buried in the cement.

1235
01:24:53,338 --> 01:24:54,838
Yeah?

1236
01:24:55,840 --> 01:24:57,930
Know how it happened?

1237
01:24:58,009 --> 01:25:00,429
Well, they was working on it,
apparently, at the time.

1238
01:25:00,512 --> 01:25:03,682
And they, I guess,
they were pouring the cement,

1239
01:25:03,765 --> 01:25:05,265
and he slipped off, you know,

1240
01:25:05,350 --> 01:25:09,350
on the upper part of the bridge
and, you know, fell in.

1241
01:25:12,190 --> 01:25:13,690
Dumb fuck.

1242
01:25:14,150 --> 01:25:16,360
-What a way to go.
-I come down here a lot.

1243
01:25:16,444 --> 01:25:18,454
You know, I get ideas.

1244
01:25:18,530 --> 01:25:21,160
Oh, yeah? What kind of ideas you get?

1245
01:25:21,825 --> 01:25:25,285
I don't know, daydreams, you know?
I daydream a lot.

1246
01:25:50,728 --> 01:25:53,148
Mr Fusco, I come for what I got coming.

1247
01:25:53,231 --> 01:25:54,481
Tony. Come on.

1248
01:25:54,566 --> 01:25:57,146
Things got a little hot under the collar,
don't you think?

1249
01:25:57,235 --> 01:25:58,485
What are you talking about?

1250
01:25:58,570 --> 01:26:00,900
I don't want to lose you, Tony.
You're a good kid.

1251
01:26:01,030 --> 01:26:04,410
Customers like you.
I want you to stay on.

1252
01:26:04,534 --> 01:26:08,084
-You mean, I ain't fired?
-No. Come on. Here.

1253
01:26:08,204 --> 01:26:11,424
-Jesus Christ. I don't believe this.
-You got a future here, Tony.

1254
01:26:11,499 --> 01:26:14,499
Here, Harold's with me 1 8 years,
since I opened.

1255
01:26:14,586 --> 01:26:16,706
Mike, 1 5 years, huh?

1256
01:26:17,255 --> 01:26:20,715
Come on, now. Give Harold
a hand, huh? He's making a mess.

1257
01:26:37,859 --> 01:26:39,939
Pete, what are you doing?

1258
01:26:41,279 --> 01:26:43,199
Trying to get up to 70%?

1259
01:26:43,281 --> 01:26:46,951
Whoa, man.
I didn't know you hung your label on her.

1260
01:26:48,453 --> 01:26:49,703
What are you doing?

1261
01:26:49,787 --> 01:26:52,117
That guy's the biggest cunt hound
in Bay Ridge.

1262
01:26:52,248 --> 01:26:54,118
Oh, my God.
I've been in serious danger.

1263
01:26:54,209 --> 01:26:58,089
It's no fucking joke, Stephanie.
That guy's a fucking sleazy whore.

1264
01:26:59,964 --> 01:27:03,134
I was dancing with the fella.
You know? Dancing.

1265
01:27:03,259 --> 01:27:06,389
-No, no. No, forget it.
-Come on. Let's dance, huh?

1266
01:27:06,471 --> 01:27:08,721
You disgust me, you know that?

1267
01:27:08,806 --> 01:27:10,016
-Well, what do you mean?
-Forget it.

1268
01:27:10,099 --> 01:27:12,599
-Forget it.
-Tony, I was just dancing with the guy.

1269
01:27:17,607 --> 01:27:18,977
Tony! Tony!

1270
01:27:19,067 --> 01:27:22,107
-Annette, what do you want?
-Just look. Look.

1271
01:27:27,158 --> 01:27:28,618
Oh, Jesus.

1272
01:28:16,124 --> 01:28:19,464
Beautiful, man. They got six or seven
of them in there and a couple of chicks.

1273
01:28:19,544 --> 01:28:22,304
Listen, why don't we wait till they get
down to about three, four people?

1274
01:28:22,380 --> 01:28:23,710
-Yeah, one or two?
-Tony!

1275
01:28:23,840 --> 01:28:26,880
-All right. I'm thinking, I'm thinking.
-Tony, listen, you gotta help...

1276
01:28:27,010 --> 01:28:29,550
-Shut up! Shut up!
-Back up, all right?

1277
01:28:29,679 --> 01:28:32,139
What are you doing?
What are you doing, Double J?

1278
01:28:32,223 --> 01:28:35,063
-Trying to back it up!
-What are you, crazy?

1279
01:28:36,019 --> 01:28:38,899
-Tony, I'm gonna get married.
-Shut up!

1280
01:28:40,690 --> 01:28:42,690
Come on, fuckers!

1281
01:28:57,749 --> 01:28:59,249
Tony!

1282
01:29:07,550 --> 01:29:11,260
Tony! Tony, help me! Please, God!

1283
01:29:19,020 --> 01:29:21,770
Hey, what the hell
you think you're doing, huh?

1284
01:29:48,299 --> 01:29:49,589
Ton!

1285
01:29:53,638 --> 01:29:56,808
Ton! Come here, it's me! Come on!

1286
01:29:56,933 --> 01:29:59,393
-Let's get out of here.
-You okay?

1287
01:30:03,272 --> 01:30:04,562
Jesus!

1288
01:30:07,485 --> 01:30:09,775
He chickened, man! Where is he?

1289
01:30:17,995 --> 01:30:19,655
Go, man! Go!

1290
01:30:23,584 --> 01:30:27,004
-Where the hell were you, huh?
-Tony, I was just driving around.

1291
01:30:27,130 --> 01:30:30,800
-Oh, Jesus Christ!
-I was looking for you. Where were you?

1292
01:30:39,308 --> 01:30:41,518
Hey, Gus. Did you get the number
of the truck that hit you?

1293
01:30:41,644 --> 01:30:43,604
Don't make me laugh, all right?
Do not make me laugh.

1294
01:30:43,688 --> 01:30:45,688
-Look at this. We don't love you, right?
-Right.

1295
01:30:45,773 --> 01:30:47,273
-We got them.
-Does that hurt?

1296
01:30:47,358 --> 01:30:48,858
Yeah, really, huh?

1297
01:30:48,943 --> 01:30:51,613
Hey, you guys really, you know,
you really kicked their asses?

1298
01:30:51,696 --> 01:30:54,026
Hey, come on, we got them
where they breathe, Italian style.

1299
01:30:54,157 --> 01:30:55,447
Yeah, that's great, you know.

1300
01:30:55,533 --> 01:30:58,793
Only, you know,
I ain't so sure it was the Barracudas.

1301
01:30:58,870 --> 01:31:01,040
Dr AIIison to Emergency.

1302
01:31:07,128 --> 01:31:09,548
Hey, what are you talking about?
You said it was.

1303
01:31:09,630 --> 01:31:11,550
No, I said it probably was.

1304
01:31:11,674 --> 01:31:12,974
Don't be pulling our legs now.

1305
01:31:13,050 --> 01:31:15,970
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

1306
01:31:16,053 --> 01:31:18,143
-You said it probably was.
-Yeah, I said probably.

1307
01:31:18,222 --> 01:31:20,472
-That's what you told us.
-I said probably 'cause I wasn't sure.

1308
01:31:20,558 --> 01:31:22,638
You know? I mean,
it could've been a Spanish...

1309
01:31:22,727 --> 01:31:24,557
Stupid, fucking bastard.

1310
01:31:24,687 --> 01:31:29,067
-We almost got our heads busted.
-Yeah, not you, lover.

1311
01:31:39,577 --> 01:31:42,157
You know, you got some fucking pair
of balls on you, you know that, Gus?

1312
01:31:42,246 --> 01:31:43,326
-Hey, hey, come on.
-You know that?

1313
01:31:43,414 --> 01:31:46,424
Hey, you know, I had to say something.
Right? I had to lay somebody out for it.

1314
01:31:46,501 --> 01:31:48,591
What are you, stupid?
You can't see who hurt you, right?

1315
01:31:48,669 --> 01:31:49,839
Oh, my God, what are you doing?

1316
01:31:49,921 --> 01:31:52,171
If I said I didn't know who it was,
they would have got off. Come on.

1317
01:31:52,256 --> 01:31:53,916
Yeah, well, fuck you, Gus.
You know what I feel like doing?

1318
01:31:54,050 --> 01:31:56,590
I feel like breaking your broken leg.
That's what I feel like doing.

1319
01:31:56,677 --> 01:31:57,927
-Hey, come on.
-Let's get out of here.

1320
01:31:58,012 --> 01:32:00,602
Oh, God, I can't believe
this whole fucking thing.

1321
01:32:01,766 --> 01:32:03,676
You wanna know something?
I could have killed him.

1322
01:32:03,768 --> 01:32:07,018
-You couldn't kill a fucking crab lice.
-Oh, shit, what do you think I am?

1323
01:32:07,104 --> 01:32:09,614
-You think I'm a coward?
-What do you think you are?

1324
01:32:09,690 --> 01:32:13,740
Enough of that shit, already. I'm bored.
I'm bored with it, all right?

1325
01:32:27,291 --> 01:32:30,881
Hey, hey. Jeez, look at this.
You're beautiful, babe.

1326
01:32:30,962 --> 01:32:33,882
Hey, come on. We got the winners here.
Let's get a table. Let's go.

1327
01:32:33,965 --> 01:32:36,215
Yeah. Let's get a table.

1328
01:32:38,261 --> 01:32:40,931
-How you doing?
-I'm all right.

1329
01:32:42,890 --> 01:32:45,230
What happened to your face, huh?

1330
01:32:45,309 --> 01:32:47,309
I cut myself shaving.

1331
01:32:47,812 --> 01:32:49,732
With a switchblade, huh?

1332
01:32:49,814 --> 01:32:51,404
Come on.

1333
01:33:01,576 --> 01:33:03,906
CIimb aboard my magic carpet

1334
01:33:03,995 --> 01:33:08,745
and Iet us take a ride to the oasis.

1335
01:33:08,833 --> 01:33:10,963
FeeI the power.

1336
01:33:37,528 --> 01:33:40,028
Open sesame.

1337
01:33:49,790 --> 01:33:52,130
A big hand
for ShirIey and CharIes Tuck.

1338
01:33:52,209 --> 01:33:54,539
Give them a big hand.
Come on, everybody.

1339
01:33:54,670 --> 01:33:57,550
What are you booing?
Come on, be cooI, everybody.

1340
01:33:57,632 --> 01:34:00,552
No way. No good. No way.

1341
01:34:00,635 --> 01:34:01,835
Yes!

1342
01:34:02,345 --> 01:34:05,305
Now we have Stephanie Mangano
and Tony Manero!

1343
01:34:06,057 --> 01:34:07,307
Come on.

1344
01:34:07,391 --> 01:34:08,811
All right.

1345
01:34:15,024 --> 01:34:16,904
Joey, hey, give me
another one of those, huh?

1346
01:34:17,026 --> 01:34:18,316
Hey, come on, you had enough.

1347
01:34:18,402 --> 01:34:19,902
Come on. I like it.
They're good. Come on.

1348
01:34:19,987 --> 01:34:21,907
All right. Get high.
You know, it's your head.

1349
01:34:22,031 --> 01:34:24,571
-That's right.
-Here you go.

1350
01:37:44,233 --> 01:37:46,613
Right on! That is the money.

1351
01:37:53,284 --> 01:37:56,544
Hey! Hey, be cooI, baby!

1352
01:37:56,620 --> 01:37:59,790
Here now, we have coupIe number 1 5,
the Puerto Ricans...

1353
01:38:11,468 --> 01:38:12,888
Wrong neighbourhood, huh?

1354
01:38:12,970 --> 01:38:15,720
Tony, listen to me,
you're gonna take the prize.

1355
01:38:57,306 --> 01:38:59,176
Jesus Christ. They're so fucking good.

1356
01:38:59,266 --> 01:39:00,926
How could they be? They're spics.

1357
01:39:01,018 --> 01:39:03,438
Look at them greasing up the floor.

1358
01:39:55,155 --> 01:39:56,695
Numero uno!

1359
01:39:57,408 --> 01:39:59,078
No contest, man. No contest.

1360
01:39:59,201 --> 01:40:01,491
I don't want to hear that shit.
They was fucking better than us.

1361
01:40:01,578 --> 01:40:03,998
They weren't better, they was different,
that's all. Just different.

1362
01:40:04,081 --> 01:40:06,251
-Bullshit.
-AII right, foIks!

1363
01:40:06,333 --> 01:40:08,083
We have the decision of the judges.

In third pIace,
we have EIizabeth and Joseph Cursa!

1365
01:40:11,422 --> 01:40:12,922
Give them a hand!

1366
01:40:13,007 --> 01:40:14,337
Baby!

1367
01:40:14,967 --> 01:40:16,297
Come on, baby.

1368
01:40:16,385 --> 01:40:17,425
Yeah!

1369
01:40:21,015 --> 01:40:22,515
Second prize!

1370
01:40:22,599 --> 01:40:26,269
From Puerto Rico, we have

1371

-You're doing them a favour!
-They're gonna take the prize.

1372
01:40:33,819 --> 01:40:35,029
-Thank you.
-Unbelievable!

1373
01:40:35,112 --> 01:40:37,362
-Don"t spend it in one pIace, baby.
-Thank you.

1374
01:40:38,407 --> 01:40:40,867
In first pIace, the cooIest,

01:40:40,951 --> 01:40:42,871
the Fred Astaire of BrookIyn,
the boogie-woogie man,

1376
01:40:42,953 --> 01:40:45,463
the man who gave you cooIness,
hotness and everything you wanted.

1377
01:40:45,539 --> 01:40:47,959
He was hot! He was right on!

1378
01:40:48,042 --> 01:40:50,632
Stephanie Mangano and Tony Manero.

1379
01:40:52,921 --> 01:40:54,301
We won.

1380
01:40:57,634 --> 01:40:59,934
Come on. Come on!

1381
01:41:03,307 --> 01:41:04,927
Didn't I tell you?

1382
01:41:09,146 --> 01:41:10,476
Won.

1383
01:41:19,156 --> 01:41:20,986
Come on, Iet"s boogie.
Come on, everybody.

1384
01:41:21,158 --> 01:41:24,448
It"s over. Come on, Iet"s dance.
Come on, everybody!

1385
01:41:32,127 --> 01:41:34,917
Man, you put them down,
is what you did, huh?

1386
01:41:35,005 --> 01:41:36,505
You phoney bastards!

1387
01:41:36,590 --> 01:41:38,840
You know who should have won
that contest.

1388
01:41:38,926 --> 01:41:41,006
My own fucking friends
can't even be straight with me.

1389
01:41:41,136 --> 01:41:43,006
You gotta lie
right through your fucking teeth.

1390
01:41:43,138 --> 01:41:44,848
-Come on!
-What's up your ass, man?

1391
01:41:44,973 --> 01:41:47,933
-Look, we won it.
-Stephanie, that was rigged.

1392
01:41:48,018 --> 01:41:50,598
That's like family. They can't give it
to no spic or no stranger.

1393
01:41:50,687 --> 01:41:51,767
What are you, crazy?

1394
01:41:51,855 --> 01:41:54,765
We was just as good
as they were, Tony, and I know it.

1395
01:41:54,858 --> 01:41:57,028
-Oh, you think so, huh?
-Yeah!

1396
01:41:59,530 --> 01:42:02,200
Here. Come with me.

1397
01:42:03,534 --> 01:42:06,874
Excuse me. Congratulations. Here.

1398
01:42:06,954 --> 01:42:08,544
I'd like to give this,
I'd like to give you that,

1399
01:42:08,664 --> 01:42:11,174
'cause I think you deserve it, all right?
Come on.

1400
01:42:12,042 --> 01:42:14,792
God damn it! Good is good.
If the spics are good, they deserve it.

1401
01:42:14,878 --> 01:42:16,798
-That's all there is to it.
-Yeah, but we won it. They didn't.

1402
01:42:16,880 --> 01:42:19,630
This is a fucking shit hole,
you know that? A fucking shit hole!

1403
01:42:19,716 --> 01:42:22,466
God damn it.
My friends, the assholes I hang out with,

1404
01:42:22,553 --> 01:42:24,973
I can't believe them sometimes.
You know that?

1405
01:42:25,055 --> 01:42:28,055
Everybody's gotta dump
on somebody, right? Of course.

1406
01:42:28,142 --> 01:42:30,732
I mean, everybody...
Everybody can't do it straight, right?

1407
01:42:30,811 --> 01:42:32,811
My pa goes to work,
he gets dumped on,

1408
01:42:32,896 --> 01:42:34,646
so he comes home
and he dumps on my mother, right?

1409
01:42:34,731 --> 01:42:36,731
Of course, right?
Then the spics, they dump on us,

1410
01:42:36,859 --> 01:42:38,899
so we gotta dump on spics.
Of course, right?

1411
01:42:39,027 --> 01:42:41,567
Everybody's dumping on everybody.

1412
01:42:41,738 --> 01:42:44,238
Even the humping's dumping
most of the time.

1413
01:42:44,324 --> 01:42:47,664
All right. Okay. Listen, would you just
tell me what's wrong? Okay?

1414
01:42:47,744 --> 01:42:48,914
-Get in.
-What is it?

1415
01:42:49,037 --> 01:42:51,077
-Get in!
-Just tell me.

1416
01:42:58,255 --> 01:43:00,715
What the hell is wrong with you?

1417
01:43:06,555 --> 01:43:09,845
Wait. Stop it. Look, just stop it!

1418
01:43:09,933 --> 01:43:12,603
Let me alone, man!
Come on. Get away!

1419
01:43:12,728 --> 01:43:14,598
You know, you're such
a fucking cockteaser, you know that?

1420
01:43:14,730 --> 01:43:16,520
Don't you fucking call me
no goddamn cockteaser!

1421
01:43:16,607 --> 01:43:17,687
You are a cockteaser!

1422
01:43:17,774 --> 01:43:19,614
-Why you hanging around with me?
-Dancing, that's why.

1423
01:43:19,735 --> 01:43:21,525
-Oh, dancing, huh? Why else?
-Yeah!

1424
01:43:21,612 --> 01:43:24,032
You wanna know?
It's bullshit, that's why. Bullshit, man.

1425
01:43:24,114 --> 01:43:26,624
I've just been
dumping my bullshit all over you,

1426
01:43:26,742 --> 01:43:28,032
selling my act on you,

1427
01:43:28,118 --> 01:43:30,288
using you,
making you think that I love you!

1428
01:43:30,412 --> 01:43:32,212
It's just all bullshit, man!

1429
01:43:32,289 --> 01:43:36,289
-You fucking cunt!
-Don't fucking start! You stop it! Don't!

1430
01:43:38,086 --> 01:43:39,626
Get off of me.

1431
01:43:40,964 --> 01:43:42,474
Oh, Stephanie.

1432
01:43:58,982 --> 01:44:01,152
-I'm mad at you, Tony.
-Hey, Tony, come on.

1433
01:44:01,235 --> 01:44:03,145
Annette's gonna give everybody
a piece of snatch pie.

1434
01:44:03,278 --> 01:44:04,488
Yeah.

1435
01:44:04,821 --> 01:44:07,321
Oh, yeah? The fuck you are.
I wanna talk to you.

1436
01:44:07,449 --> 01:44:09,739
-Hey, what are you doing?
-What is with you, huh?

1437
01:44:09,826 --> 01:44:12,076
-What's with you, you little punk?
-What are you doing?

1438
01:44:12,162 --> 01:44:15,752
-What is it, man? What the fuck is it?
-You don't give a shit about her!

1439
01:44:18,752 --> 01:44:21,002
Come on, Annette. Get in the car.

1440
01:44:29,596 --> 01:44:31,806
Come on. Do it.

1441
01:44:37,354 --> 01:44:40,114
I told you.
You can fuck all night on this speed.

1442
01:44:40,190 --> 01:44:41,440
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah, you will.

1443
01:44:41,525 --> 01:44:43,525
Joey, what you doing back there?

1444
01:44:43,652 --> 01:44:45,532
Hey, you fuck.
The first is always the best.

1445
01:44:45,654 --> 01:44:47,204
That's right.

1446
01:44:55,831 --> 01:44:57,671
Yes. Yes.

1447
01:44:58,834 --> 01:45:00,214
Joey?

1448
01:45:02,045 --> 01:45:03,375
Oh, God.

1449
01:45:08,385 --> 01:45:11,545
Come on, Double J. You're up.

1450
01:45:11,680 --> 01:45:13,720
See you guys later, huh?

1451
01:45:16,893 --> 01:45:19,403
-No. Joey.
-Come on, mother.

1452
01:45:19,563 --> 01:45:21,403
-Oh, yeah! My turn.
-No. You know what?

1453
01:45:21,481 --> 01:45:24,571
No, Double J. No, I don't wanna do it.

1454
01:45:29,698 --> 01:45:31,528
Fuck-A!

1455
01:45:34,077 --> 01:45:36,577
Shit. With me she's gotta cry?

1456
01:45:36,663 --> 01:45:40,253
-God damn, Annette. Come on.
-No. No. Don't.

1457
01:45:40,375 --> 01:45:41,825
Come on.

1458
01:45:52,596 --> 01:45:53,756
Yeah!

1459
01:45:58,685 --> 01:46:01,095
Fuck! Double J!

1460
01:46:01,188 --> 01:46:03,688
Come on, Double J! Come on!

1461
01:46:09,738 --> 01:46:13,778
-Give me a beer huh?
-Hey! Hey! With no pants.

1462
01:46:13,867 --> 01:46:15,697
And no hands!

1463
01:46:16,620 --> 01:46:18,120
Here, beer.

1464
01:46:20,707 --> 01:46:23,127
-All right!
-All right.

1465
01:46:23,377 --> 01:46:26,457
Fuck you, Manhattan!
Come to Brooklyn!

1466
01:46:30,550 --> 01:46:32,800
Mine's so big, I gotta strap it to my leg.

1467
01:46:32,886 --> 01:46:35,636
Anita says
I got the biggest thing in town.

1468
01:46:36,765 --> 01:46:38,635
Proud of yourself now?

1469
01:46:39,476 --> 01:46:42,476
Is that what you wanted? Good.

1470
01:46:44,481 --> 01:46:46,231
Now you're a cunt.

1471
01:46:47,651 --> 01:46:50,491
Man, don't fuck around.
What are you doing?

1472
01:46:53,407 --> 01:46:55,567
Where you going? Annette.

1473
01:47:01,498 --> 01:47:04,078
No. No. No. Leave me.

1474
01:47:07,671 --> 01:47:09,841
Come on, Annette. I'm sorry.

1475
01:47:11,633 --> 01:47:15,513
-Annette, I said I'm sorry.
-I didn't want to do it.

1476
01:47:17,472 --> 01:47:18,852
Look at this guy.

1477
01:47:18,932 --> 01:47:20,932
Hey, Bobby! Hey, you punk!

1478
01:47:21,017 --> 01:47:23,687
Tony! Look at me!

1479
01:47:23,812 --> 01:47:27,362
-Look at the punk.
-Bobby, get down. It's too dangerous.

1480
01:47:27,441 --> 01:47:32,281
Look at me, Tony.
Hey, Tony, look at me!

1481
01:47:32,362 --> 01:47:34,492
Look! Hey, Tony!

1482
01:47:36,158 --> 01:47:38,368
I'm not kidding, Bobby.
Get down from there.

1483
01:47:38,452 --> 01:47:40,702
I'm all right. I'm all right.

1484
01:47:41,872 --> 01:47:45,372
I'm all right, Tony.
I'm all right. Watch me.

1485
01:47:53,717 --> 01:47:57,137
-Hey, Tony, look at me!
-That's crazy. Now you're being crazy.

1486
01:47:57,220 --> 01:47:59,220
Look at me, look at me, look at me.
I'm doing it.

1487
01:47:59,306 --> 01:48:00,556
-It's too dangerous.
-Look at me.

1488
01:48:00,640 --> 01:48:02,520
-I see you.
-Look at me.

1489
01:48:04,019 --> 01:48:05,479
Oh, Jesus.

1490
01:48:08,482 --> 01:48:10,902
It's a long way down there.

1491
01:48:12,402 --> 01:48:14,492
-Give me your hand.
-I did it!

1492
01:48:14,571 --> 01:48:16,991
Come back. Come back in. Come on.

1493
01:48:19,409 --> 01:48:20,739
-Watch.
-Don't, don't.

1494
01:48:20,869 --> 01:48:23,579
You're making me
very nervous now, Bobby.

1495
01:48:23,663 --> 01:48:25,833
Don't do that. Jesus Christ.

1496
01:48:25,916 --> 01:48:29,836
Get over here. Get over here, right now!
Give me your hand.

1497
01:48:31,087 --> 01:48:33,757
Oh, Jesus! No. No!

1498
01:48:33,840 --> 01:48:36,180
-Oh, come on.
-I did it.

1499
01:48:36,259 --> 01:48:39,089
-What did you do?
-I did it.

1500
01:48:39,179 --> 01:48:40,429
Watch.

1501
01:48:44,351 --> 01:48:47,101
Come on, Bobby. Get over here.
Right now. Come on.

1502
01:48:47,229 --> 01:48:48,939
Now, don't get upset.
Come on. We'll talk.

1503
01:48:49,064 --> 01:48:51,024
We'll go talk in the car.
It's warmer there.

1504
01:48:51,107 --> 01:48:53,437
You didn't talk to me before.

1505
01:48:54,694 --> 01:48:57,074
How come you never called me?

1506
01:49:00,116 --> 01:49:02,536
-I didn't wanna fuck up.
-You didn't fuck up, Bobby.

1507
01:49:02,619 --> 01:49:06,789
-Come on. We'll talk, all right?
-I didn't wanna fuck up this time.

1508
01:49:12,629 --> 01:49:17,549
Oh, God! Oh, God! Oh, God! Oh, God!

1509
01:49:28,019 --> 01:49:29,229
No!

1510
01:49:40,782 --> 01:49:43,742
Any of you guys think
maybe he killed himself?

1511
01:49:43,827 --> 01:49:45,037
No.

1512
01:49:49,374 --> 01:49:52,294
There's ways of killing yourself
without killing yourself.

1513
01:49:52,377 --> 01:49:55,707
Yeah. Okay, you can go now.

1514
01:50:01,636 --> 01:50:02,846
Forget the number, Chief.

1515
01:50:02,929 --> 01:50:05,759
We ain't gonna find nothing
out there tonight.

1516
01:50:09,060 --> 01:50:10,230
Shit.

1517
01:50:24,576 --> 01:50:25,696
Ton?

1518
01:50:26,494 --> 01:50:27,874
Hey, Tony!

1519
01:52:35,665 --> 01:52:37,035
Stephanie?

1520
01:52:39,794 --> 01:52:42,424
-Is that you?
-Yeah, it's me, Stephanie.

1521
01:52:42,505 --> 01:52:44,665
Hey, look, look,
I'm really sorry about last night.

1522
01:52:44,758 --> 01:52:48,088
-You're sorry?
-Yeah, I'm sorry, Stephanie. I just...

1523
01:52:48,178 --> 01:52:50,888
Look, it won't happen again,
I promise you.

1524
01:52:50,972 --> 01:52:52,892
I just... I just, I really need to talk to you.

1525
01:52:52,974 --> 01:52:55,774
What are you talking about,
you need to talk to me?

1526
01:52:55,852 --> 01:52:58,772
It's just like what I said.
I need to talk to you.

1527
01:53:00,940 --> 01:53:02,780
Okay, listen. Now, if I open this door,

1528
01:53:02,859 --> 01:53:05,109
you're not gonna pull
any funny stuff on me, right?

1529
01:53:05,195 --> 01:53:06,985
No, of course not.

1530
01:53:18,333 --> 01:53:21,043
First time I ever let a known rapist
in my apartment.

1531
01:53:21,127 --> 01:53:24,127
Hey, look, I'll just stay right here,
all right?

1532
01:53:24,214 --> 01:53:28,514
So, that way you don't think that I'm
gonna, you know, jump you or nothing.

1533
01:53:31,387 --> 01:53:33,557
What's wrong with you, man?

1534
01:53:37,727 --> 01:53:39,937
Nothing. I'll tell you later, all right?

1535
01:53:42,065 --> 01:53:45,855
Well, you can't just stand there.
This is ridiculous. Come on.

1536
01:53:49,072 --> 01:53:51,622
I've been up all night
just walking and looking around.

1537
01:53:51,699 --> 01:53:54,829
And, you know,
I'm gonna get myself my own place.

1538
01:53:54,911 --> 01:53:56,201
You know what I'm gonna do?

1539
01:53:56,287 --> 01:53:57,907
I'm getting my money,
I'm coming back, you know.

1540
01:53:57,997 --> 01:53:59,247
'Cause I ain't going back there.

1541
01:53:59,332 --> 01:54:02,712
Wait a minute. Why don't you sit down,
okay? Come on.

1542
01:54:06,548 --> 01:54:09,298
-So, what are you doing?
-What am I doing?

1543
01:54:09,384 --> 01:54:12,684
I'm just not going back there, that's all.
They're assholes back there.

1544
01:54:12,762 --> 01:54:15,012
-I'm fed up to here with it. It's bullshit.
-Okay. Okay.

1545
01:54:15,098 --> 01:54:16,888
What are you gonna do?

1546
01:54:16,975 --> 01:54:19,095
What do you do?
You come in. You get a job. You know.

1547
01:54:19,185 --> 01:54:21,135
Do what you do. Get a nice apartment.

1548
01:54:21,229 --> 01:54:23,359
Okay, what kind of job?

1549
01:54:25,149 --> 01:54:26,979
I don't know.

1550
01:54:27,068 --> 01:54:29,148
What did you do? You came in,
you couldn't do nothing, right?

1551
01:54:29,237 --> 01:54:31,407
I could type when I came.

1552
01:54:33,658 --> 01:54:37,078
No big deal. I'm an able person.
I mean, I can do these things.

1553
01:54:37,161 --> 01:54:39,201
Yeah, of course you can.

1554
01:54:41,541 --> 01:54:44,131
Tony, I wanna tell you something.

1555
01:54:45,044 --> 01:54:48,384
Now, you know, I said
all that stuff to you about...

1556
01:54:49,299 --> 01:54:52,679
Using you,
practising my act on you, you know?

1557
01:54:53,303 --> 01:54:54,803
It wasn't true.

1558
01:54:54,888 --> 01:54:58,138
There's a lot of other reasons
that I was hanging around you.

1559
01:54:58,224 --> 01:55:01,484
-What do you mean?
-You made me feel better.

1560
01:55:03,062 --> 01:55:06,442
You gave me, like, admiration,
you know? Respect.

1561
01:55:07,525 --> 01:55:08,855
Support.

1562
01:55:13,406 --> 01:55:17,736
Stephanie, maybe now that, you know,
like, I'm gonna be in town like I planned,

1563
01:55:17,827 --> 01:55:20,577
maybe, like, we could see each other.

1564
01:55:21,873 --> 01:55:25,043
No, I don't mean like that.
I know what you're thinking.

1565
01:55:25,126 --> 01:55:27,916
You're thinking, like,
I'm promoting your pussy, but I ain't.

1566
01:55:28,004 --> 01:55:29,714
I mean, like, friends, right?

1567
01:55:29,797 --> 01:55:33,007
You know, like you once said,
we could help each other.

1568
01:55:33,092 --> 01:55:36,892
-Wanna be friends?
-Yeah. I'd like to be friends with you.

1569
01:55:39,140 --> 01:55:41,600
Think you know how, huh?

1570
01:55:41,684 --> 01:55:43,444
Think you could be friends with a girl?

1571
01:55:43,519 --> 01:55:46,479
Could you stand
being friends with a girl, huh?

1572
01:55:47,440 --> 01:55:48,820
-The truth?
-Yeah.

1573
01:55:48,900 --> 01:55:50,110
I don't know.

1574
01:55:51,194 --> 01:55:52,444
I don't know. I mean, I could try.

1575
01:55:52,528 --> 01:55:55,358
That's all I can say, Stephanie.
I could try.

1576
01:56:01,454 --> 01:56:03,504
Okay. Okay.

1577
01:56:04,582 --> 01:56:07,882
Let's be friends, all right?
We'll just be friends.

1578
01:56:09,170 --> 01:56:10,550
All right.

1579
01:56:11,673 --> 01:56:12,673
Okay.

1580
01:56:17,345 --> 01:56:18,845
Friends, man.
