Well, you can tell
By the way I use my walk

6
00:01:15,325 --> 00:01:17,660
I'm a woman's man
No time to talk

And women warm

I've been kicked around
Since I was born

00:01:22,291 --> 00:01:24,584
And now it's all right
It's okay

Hiya, Tony. Two or three?

19
00:01:58,202 --> 00:02:00,661
Two. Two. Give me two. That's good.

20
00:02:01,705 --> 00:02:04,540
Well, now, I get low
And I get high

21
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:06,542
And if I can't get either
I really try

All right, look, put me down for $5
for that blue shirt in the window.

That bastard.
Wait till he runs out of something.

Listen, you know what to tell her.

00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:04,410
Excuse me, ma'am, I gotta get by.

00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:05,828
- Got a second?
- Just a minute.

That's all right. Look, I'm gonna
make you a deal on this paint.

60
00:04:12,461 --> 00:04:13,920
- I'm very angry with you.
- That's all right.

61
00:04:14,004 --> 00:04:17,131
Look, I'm gonna make you
a nice deal on this. $1 off for you.

00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:23,554
- MAN: I'll take a gallon of this.
- All right.

65

You got it. Heads up.

66

That's all right.

67
00:04:30,229 --> 00:04:32,563
Customers like that,
it gives them a sense of power.

68
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:34,774
I need some brushes.

69
00:04:34,858 --> 00:04:36,901
All right, how much painting
you planning to do?

70
00:04:37,027 --> 00:04:40,446
After these two rooms,
I wouldn't paint my wife's ass purple.

71
00:04:40,531 --> 00:04:42,198
What color is it now?

72
00:04:42,324 --> 00:04:44,033
You wanna know
what color my wife's ass is?

73
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:45,910
You brung it up.

74
00:04:46,036 --> 00:04:50,414
Actually, it ain't got no color,
just stripes, them stretch stripes.

75
00:04:50,541 --> 00:04:51,874
What about them brushes?

76
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,378
Right. See that second display counter?
Over there.

- Hey, Mr. Fusco, can I get an advance?
- Payday's Monday.

78
00:05:05,764 --> 00:05:07,598
I know payday is Monday,

79
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:09,809
but every place else
is Friday or Saturday.

80
00:05:09,893 --> 00:05:11,477
And they're broke on Monday.

81
00:05:11,562 --> 00:05:13,563
- Boozing, whoring...
- Oh, come off it.

82
00:05:13,689 --> 00:05:15,731
Pissing away their money all weekend.

83
00:05:15,858 --> 00:05:18,776
This way, you're paid on a Monday,
you got money all week.

84
00:05:18,902 --> 00:05:22,446
- You can save a little, build a future.
- Oh, fuck the future.

85
00:05:22,573 --> 00:05:28,077
No, Tony, you can't fuck the future,
the future fucks you.

86
00:05:28,203 --> 00:05:32,373
It catches up with you, and it fucks you
if you ain't planned for it.

87
00:05:32,457 --> 00:05:35,084
Look, tonight is the future,
and I am planning for it.

88
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:37,044
There's a shirt I gotta buy,
a beautiful shirt. Blue...

89
00:05:37,129 --> 00:05:39,422
Sorry, Tony, no exceptions.

90
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,302
Just wait till you need an advance,
all right?

91
00:05:44,428 --> 00:05:45,761
Big shot.

00:05:53,437 --> 00:05:54,937
BOY 2: Thanks, Tony.

97
00:05:58,442 --> 00:06:00,443

Your mother wants to know
where you been.

00:06:17,628 --> 00:06:19,253
Where you been?

103
00:06:19,338 --> 00:06:22,256
Your father's asking you!
Where you been?

104
00:06:22,341 --> 00:06:25,551
Dinner's gonna be late tonight,
they was out of things at the market.

105
00:06:25,636 --> 00:06:27,637
But you'd have been late
if it was normal.

106
00:06:27,721 --> 00:06:30,431
- Hey, Tony.
- Hey, hot stuff. Give me a kiss.

107
00:06:30,516 --> 00:06:33,893
- Look what I made for you. Here.
- Oh, that is beautiful.

108
00:06:33,977 --> 00:06:35,019
- You like it?
- Yeah.

109
00:06:35,145 --> 00:06:36,187
You'll put it in your room?

110
00:06:36,313 --> 00:06:37,438
Yeah, I'll put it in my room right now,
how's that?

111
00:06:37,523 --> 00:06:38,564
- Okay.

Here I am
Praying for this moment to last

117
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:07,718
Living on the music so fine

118
00:07:07,845 --> 00:07:09,887
Borne on the wind

119
00:07:10,013 --> 00:07:15,434

We know how to show it

124
00:07:32,953 --> 00:07:37,373
And that sweet city woman
She moves through the light

125
00:07:37,708 --> 00:07:40,376
Controlling my mind and my soul

126
00:07:42,212 --> 00:07:45,882
When you reach out for me, yeah
And the feeling is bright

127
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:49,677
Then I get night fever
Night fever

128
00:07:49,761 --> 00:07:51,846
We know how to do it

129

- Dinner's on the table.
- I ain't hungry.

130
00:07:54,975 --> 00:07:57,643
Hey, just because
you're kicking in for food,

131
00:07:57,728 --> 00:07:59,103
don't mean you don't gotta eat.

132
00:07:59,188 --> 00:08:00,730
You still gotta eat.

133
00:08:00,814 --> 00:08:03,232
- I got my shirt on, all right?
- So?

134
00:08:03,317 --> 00:08:05,735
So, I don't want to get anything on it,
that's what.

135
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:07,612
You got nothing to be afraid of.

136
00:08:07,696 --> 00:08:10,031
Your mother's spaghetti sauce
don't drip.

137
00:08:10,115 --> 00:08:12,658
It don't taste and it don't drip.

138
00:08:13,785 --> 00:08:15,119
Let's go.

139
00:08:16,246 --> 00:08:21,417
Making it mine

140
00:08:21,502 --> 00:08:25,171
Night fever
Night fever

141
00:08:25,255 --> 00:08:27,048
How come every day
it's the same thing?

142
00:08:27,132 --> 00:08:29,217
I come home,
you tell me I'm late for dinner

143
00:08:29,301 --> 00:08:32,845
when you know that I gotta work till 6:00
and I can't make dinner on time.

144
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:34,555
You should've been a priest,
like your brother,

145
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,058
you wouldn't worry about a job.

146
00:08:37,809 --> 00:08:39,018
Yeah.

147
00:08:39,728 --> 00:08:41,979
Every time you mention Frank, Jr.,
you gotta cross yourself?

148
00:08:42,064 --> 00:08:46,025
He's a priest, ain't he?
Father Frank, Jr., your brother.

149
00:08:46,109 --> 00:08:49,362
Your mother doesn't have much
to cross herself about these days.

150
00:08:49,446 --> 00:08:51,030
You're so jealous of Frank, Jr.

151
00:08:51,114 --> 00:08:53,282
- Oh, shut up, will you?
- FRANK, SR: Hey!

152
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:57,787
- What are you doing?
- Hey, the shirt! Watch the shirt, stupid.

153
00:08:57,871 --> 00:08:59,580
FLO: All right. Come on.

154
00:08:59,665 --> 00:09:01,791
- Mangia, mangia.
- Yeah, go ahead. Eat, eat.

155
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:03,960
I got more pork chops, more spaghetti.

156

00:27:25,729 --> 00:27:27,855
Nothing.
I'd just rather be doing 2001 tonight.

469
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:29,398
Yeah? Well, fucking do it.

470
00:27:29,483 --> 00:27:31,692
Oh, «fucking do it.»
20, 30 bucks, asshole!

471
00:27:31,777 --> 00:27:33,903
You got 20, 30 bucks
to blow twice a week?

- Hey, Tony.

GUS: Man, I'm gonna get myself
one of these, you know.

474
00:27:38,242 --> 00:27:39,617
You're never gonna get yourself
one of these.

475
00:27:39,701 --> 00:27:40,785
These things cost too much money.

476
00:27:40,869 --> 00:27:41,953
You'll never have that kind of money.

477
00:27:42,037 --> 00:27:43,579
Hey, you, you know,
I've had you up to here.

478
00:27:43,664 --> 00:27:44,914
That's your favorite speech.

479

You're never gonna have
that kind of money.

480
00:27:46,166 --> 00:27:47,291
Not you, not me, not anybody.

481
00:27:47,376 --> 00:27:50,086
Hey, get it together before it's all
over the street, huh? You see this?

482
00:27:50,170 --> 00:27:51,504
This is a Caddy Seville.

483
00:27:51,588 --> 00:27:54,131
My Uncle Nunzio's got one of these
and he's got a Mercedes Benz, too.

484
00:27:54,216 --> 00:27:55,341
You know how he got it?

485
00:27:55,425 --> 00:27:58,302
He forced his partner to sell out.
He gave him a real screwing.

486
00:27:58,387 --> 00:28:01,472
It's a dog-eat-dog world, right?
Everybody's out for what they can get.

487
00:28:01,557 --> 00:28:03,182
It's true.

488
00:28:03,267 --> 00:28:05,059
They got it all locked up.

489
00:28:05,143 --> 00:28:06,602
Ain't nobody gonna give you a chance.

490
00:28:06,687 --> 00:28:08,229
DOUBLE J:
Nobody gives you nothing, Joey.

491
00:28:08,313 --> 00:28:10,857
JOEY: Yeah, you know,
it's every man for himself.

492
00:28:10,941 --> 00:28:13,067
It's a stinking rat race.

493
00:28:15,237 --> 00:28:18,739
Hey, that stuff goes on beautiful, Tony.
Best vinyl I ever seen at that price.

494
00:28:18,824 --> 00:28:21,284
See? I told you.
You just listen to me, right?

495
00:28:21,368 --> 00:28:24,120
You know, you saved me a bit
of change on the job. You know paint.

496
00:28:24,204 --> 00:28:26,372
You ever want a job as a painter,
why don't you let me know, huh?

497
00:28:26,456 --> 00:28:28,207
You make twice as much
as you make here,

498
00:28:28,292 --> 00:28:30,501
but you break your back.
You interested?

499
00:28:30,586 --> 00:28:32,503
- I don't know.
- Don't be interested.

500
00:28:32,588 --> 00:28:36,090
You'll make twice as much,
but you'll break your back.

501
00:28:36,175 --> 00:28:39,468
- No advances, no nothing. It's payday...
- I gave you a raise.

502
00:28:39,553 --> 00:28:41,762
- You gave me what?
- A raise.

503
00:28:41,847 --> 00:28:45,641
- You kidding me?
- No. Come on, look. See how much it is.

504
00:28:45,726 --> 00:28:48,102
You gave me a raise? Thank you.
I can't believe this.

505
00:28:48,187 --> 00:28:49,562
Wait, hold on, you better look first.

506
00:28:49,646 --> 00:28:51,272
I don't gotta look.
It don't make no difference.

507
00:28:51,356 --> 00:28:52,940
You gave me a raise.
That's the important thing.

508
00:28:53,025 --> 00:28:55,359
- It's only $2.50.
- So what?

509
00:28:55,444 --> 00:28:57,820
That's $2.50. It ain't much.

510
00:28:57,905 --> 00:29:00,448
The important thing is it's a raise.
I think that's really great.

511
00:29:00,532 --> 00:29:02,450
I'll tell you what,
I'm gonna give you $3.50, all right?

512
00:29:02,534 --> 00:29:03,910
- You do not have to, Mr. Fusco.
- I'll give you $3.50.

513
00:29:03,994 --> 00:29:05,536
- I like the raise just the way it is.
- I'll give you $1 more.

514
00:29:05,621 --> 00:29:07,830
Shut up, will you? $4.

515
00:29:07,915 --> 00:29:10,124
I'll make it an even $4.

516

Christ, I've never seen anybody

517
00:29:11,585 --> 00:29:14,128
so shit-ass happy over
a crummy $2.50 raise.

518
00:29:14,213 --> 00:29:17,673
Wait a minute. $2?
You just said $4.00, didn't you?

519
00:29:22,930 --> 00:29:24,222
What the hell are you doing?

520
00:29:24,306 --> 00:29:26,682
- I just feel like it, all right?
- Girls do that.

521
00:29:26,767 --> 00:29:28,809
I got a raise today.
How do you like that?

522
00:29:28,894 --> 00:29:30,978
Yeah?
Why didn't you say so during dinner?

523
00:29:31,063 --> 00:29:34,565
We could've used the conversation.
Put them down. Come here.

524
00:29:34,650 --> 00:29:37,443
- How much you get?
- It's gonna be $4.00.

525
00:29:37,528 --> 00:29:39,904
It was... It was $2.50, right?

526
00:29:39,988 --> 00:29:41,697
But he raised the raise

527
00:29:41,782 --> 00:29:44,283
when he found out
I wasn't so, you know, disappointed.

528
00:29:44,368 --> 00:29:45,868
- $4.00?
- Yeah.

529
00:29:45,953 --> 00:29:49,080
Shit. You know what $4.00 buys today?

530
00:29:49,164 --> 00:29:51,457
It don't even buy $3.00.

531
00:29:51,542 --> 00:29:54,335
I don't see nobody giving you a raise
down at Unemployment.

532
00:29:54,419 --> 00:29:56,879
$4.00. Shit.

533
00:29:56,964 --> 00:29:59,674
I knew you'd piss on it.
Go on, just piss on it, right?

534
00:29:59,758 --> 00:30:02,343
A raise says, like, you're good,
you know what I mean?

535
00:30:02,427 --> 00:30:04,679
You know how many times somebody
told me I was good in my life?

536
00:30:04,763 --> 00:30:06,931
Two. Two. Twice. Two fucking times,

dancing at the disco.

Why ain't you waiting inside?

Well, I wanted to watch you
come down the street.

542

I like the way you walk.

Tony, listen, I've been thinking.

Maybe I'll make it with you.

Jesus Christ.

Annette. You know that?

that means we're gonna make it, right?

I got no say in this at all, right?

It's time we went out.

551
00:31:05,157 --> 00:31:06,657
You told me you wanted to do it.

552
00:31:06,742 --> 00:31:08,576
You told me
how horny a man gets when he's 19,

553
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:10,453
how much his balls ache
morning, noon and night,

if he don't get it.

How do you remember those things?

556
00:31:16,084 --> 00:31:18,419
Look, Annette, we're gonna be
spending a lot of time together,

557
00:31:18,504 --> 00:31:20,838
you know, rehearsing,
practicing, whatnot.

it would be like we was going together.

You a nice girl or you a cunt?

I don't know. Both?

562

You can't be both. I mean, that's a thing
a girl's gotta decide early on.

563

you're gonna be a nice girl or a cunt.

- Yo, Frankie!
- Tony.

617
00:34:43,333 --> 00:34:45,668
- Hey, how you doing?
- Hiya, kid.

618
00:34:48,130 --> 00:34:50,089
- It's good to see you.
- You, too.

619
00:34:50,174 --> 00:34:52,508
Yeah. You look good.

620
00:34:52,593 --> 00:34:55,511
No, I don't. You do. You look wonderful.

621
00:34:55,637 --> 00:34:58,264
- You checking out my trophy?
- Oh, yeah. That's you, huh?

622
00:34:58,348 --> 00:35:00,183
- Yeah.
- «First prize.»

623
00:35:00,934 --> 00:35:02,852
Looks just like you.

624
00:35:02,936 --> 00:35:04,437
Hey, what did you say
to them downstairs?

625
00:35:04,521 --> 00:35:06,355
They look crazy,
they look like zombies, like...

626
00:35:06,481 --> 00:35:08,524
Like somebody died or something.

627
00:35:08,650 --> 00:35:10,693
I think they're in shock, Tony.

628
00:35:10,777 --> 00:35:14,363
In shock?
Well, how come they're in shock?

629
00:35:14,448 --> 00:35:16,699
I'm leaving the church, Tony.

630
00:35:17,534 --> 00:35:20,328
Oh, yeah, yeah. Sure.
Leaving the church.

631
00:35:21,496 --> 00:35:24,832
- Tell me another one.
- I'm leaving the priesthood.

632
00:35:25,876 --> 00:35:28,961
Oh, come on, Frank.
Don't fool around like that.

633
00:35:29,046 --> 00:35:30,880
Do you think I'm losing my hair?

634
00:35:30,964 --> 00:35:33,883
It looks awful thin
right over here and here.

635
00:35:35,886 --> 00:35:38,304
Are you serious?

636
00:35:38,388 --> 00:35:40,223
Can I borrow some of your clothes
until I buy some?

637
00:35:40,307 --> 00:35:42,725
I don't want to wear the uniform.

638
00:35:44,228 --> 00:35:46,312
I'm sorry, Frank. I really am. I'm sorry.

639
00:35:46,396 --> 00:35:48,397
What are you sorry about?

640
00:35:49,483 --> 00:35:51,400
You got fired, huh?

641
00:35:51,527 --> 00:35:53,486
I didn't get fired. I quit.

642
00:35:53,570 --> 00:35:54,737
You quit?

643
00:35:54,863 --> 00:35:57,573
Yeah, you can do those things,
you know.

644
00:36:06,583 --> 00:36:10,169
What did Mom say?
What did she say about it?

645
00:36:10,254 --> 00:36:14,841
She said, «Dear Lord, what am I
gonna tell Theresa and Marie?»

646
00:36:14,925 --> 00:36:18,427
- And Dad? What did he say about it?
- They're ashamed, the both of them.

647
00:36:18,554 --> 00:36:20,555
They're ashamed, right?

648
00:36:22,224 --> 00:36:24,267
You ashamed of me, Tony?

649
00:36:25,561 --> 00:36:27,270
Yeah, you are.

650
00:36:28,772 --> 00:36:31,941
- They didn't ask why or nothing?
- No.

651
00:36:32,025 --> 00:36:35,778
I think they're afraid to.
Like, I might say, «celibacy.»

652
00:36:39,283 --> 00:36:40,449
But...

653
00:36:43,787 --> 00:36:45,246
(SIGHING)

654
00:36:47,624 --> 00:36:50,793
You gonna sleep here tonight?
You wanna sleep in my room?

655
00:36:50,878 --> 00:36:53,796
- Yeah, I thought I would.
- All right, you can...

656
00:36:53,881 --> 00:36:56,257
I'll get your blankets for you.

657
00:37:16,111 --> 00:37:18,613
Frank, how come you left? Really?

658
00:37:22,409 --> 00:37:25,828
It's not easy to explain, Anthony.
A lot of things.

659
00:37:26,914 --> 00:37:29,332
One day, you look at a crucifix,

660
00:37:30,792 --> 00:37:33,920
and all you see
is a man dying on a cross.

661
00:37:35,255 --> 00:37:38,174
But that's only a backdrop
to something else.

662
00:37:39,259 --> 00:37:43,429
Mama and Papa,
their dreams of pious glory.

663
00:37:43,972 --> 00:37:46,974
They turn you
into what they wish at a time...

664
00:37:48,477 --> 00:37:52,271
You can't defend yourself
against their fantasies.

665
00:37:52,356 --> 00:37:56,526
All I ever really had any belief in
was their image of me as a priest.

666
00:37:56,652 --> 00:37:58,027
That's all.

667
00:38:05,953 --> 00:38:10,122
Guess we're gonna have to take
your picture down from the mantle.

668
00:38:14,378 --> 00:38:16,462
Know what's weird?

669
00:38:16,547 --> 00:38:19,715
Like, I always felt like
I was the shit of the family,

670
00:38:19,842 --> 00:38:21,217
and you was always, like, perfect.

671
00:38:21,301 --> 00:38:25,680
Now that I'm the disgrace to the family,
I'm not so perfect anymore.

672
00:38:26,473 --> 00:38:29,058
So, maybe you're not shit anymore.

673
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:35,314
Yeah, maybe if you ain't so good,
I ain't so bad, you know?

674
00:38:35,983 --> 00:38:40,403
Yeah.

675
00:38:46,910 --> 00:38:48,494
- Give me the groceries, motherfucker.
- Hey, come on.

676
00:38:48,579 --> 00:38:49,912
- Hey, don't take my groceries, man.
- I'm hungry.

677
00:38:50,038 --> 00:38:51,414
- I'm hungry, Gus.
- Hey, what are you doing?

678
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:53,916
Hey, come on! Hey, come on!
Hey, don't eat the apple!

679
00:38:54,042 --> 00:38:55,918
- Give me... Give me it back.
- Here.

680
00:38:56,044 --> 00:38:58,171
Jesus.
What's the matter with you anyway?

681
00:38:58,255 --> 00:39:00,590
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

682
00:39:00,674 --> 00:39:02,508
My brother, he quit the Church.
You believe that?

683
00:39:02,593 --> 00:39:04,010
I feel...

684
00:39:04,094 --> 00:39:06,179
I feel wild. I got all this energy.
I can't believe it.

685
00:39:06,263 --> 00:39:07,346
Yeah?

686
00:39:07,431 --> 00:39:08,848
Hey, listen, I'll call you later tonight,
all right?

687
00:39:08,932 --> 00:39:10,266
Yeah, we'll do... Hey!

688
00:39:10,350 --> 00:39:12,894
- See you later, Gus.
- I'll see you.

689
00:39:13,937 --> 00:39:14,937
(DISCO DUCK PLAYING)

00:39:15,063 --> 00:39:16,105
Come on, honey, higher with the arms.

691
00:39:16,231 --> 00:39:18,274
Yeah, that's it.

692
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:20,401
Yeah, do it to me!

Pete, she come in?

695
00:39:24,781 --> 00:39:26,949
I told you on the phone,
she comes in on Tuesday.

696
00:39:27,034 --> 00:39:29,869
- I know. So, did she come in or what?
- And what is it today, huh?

697
00:39:29,953 --> 00:39:31,746
- It's Tuesday.
- Yeah.

698
00:39:33,707 --> 00:39:37,543
Hey, Ton! Watch it, man.
That one's practicing to be a bitch.

699
00:39:37,628 --> 00:39:39,378
Come on, people!

700
00:39:40,714 --> 00:39:45,092
Good, yeah. Oh, that's good.
You're doing great. Yeah.

(DISCO MUSIC PLAYING)

702
00:40:17,501 --> 00:40:19,669
Hello, Stephanie Mangano.

703
00:40:19,795 --> 00:40:22,088
I'm Tony Manero.

704
00:40:22,172 --> 00:40:25,174
We both got the same last initials.
How do you like that?

705
00:40:25,259 --> 00:40:27,343
Wow. We get married,
I don't have to change the monogram

706
00:40:27,469 --> 00:40:29,345
on my luggage, huh?

707
00:40:30,848 --> 00:40:33,015
Somebody told me
you was practicing to be a bitch.

708
00:40:33,141 --> 00:40:34,350
Is that true?

709
00:40:41,775 --> 00:40:43,943
All right, Mr. Manero.
What do you want to ask me?

710
00:40:44,027 --> 00:40:46,028
I would like to take you out to coffee.
Would that be good?

711
00:40:46,154 --> 00:40:48,114
That's it, huh?
You want me to have coffee with you?

712
00:40:48,198 --> 00:40:50,116
I think you're a very good dancer.

713
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:53,870
You know that 2001 Odyssey,

714
00:40:53,954 --> 00:40:56,455
they got a dance contest now.

715
00:40:56,540 --> 00:41:00,042
And I think that we could be
a dynamite team together.

716
00:41:03,630 --> 00:41:05,965
- How old are you, huh?
- I'm 20.

717
00:41:07,217 --> 00:41:12,138
Well, I'm 19 at the moment,
but I'll be 20 very shortly.

718
00:41:12,222 --> 00:41:13,723
What I think is this.

719
00:41:13,807 --> 00:41:15,725
There's a world of difference
between us, you know?

720
00:41:15,851 --> 00:41:18,561
Not just chronologically,
but emotionally,

721
00:41:18,687 --> 00:41:21,063
culturally, physically, every which way.

722
00:41:21,148 --> 00:41:22,815
And this world would get much bigger

723
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:25,693
and much worse
with every passing week.

724
00:41:26,403 --> 00:41:28,112
What kind of shit is that?

725
00:41:28,238 --> 00:41:30,781
- Coffee, not sex.
- Just coffee, huh?

726
00:41:30,908 --> 00:41:33,659
See, look, where I work,
the people are very remarkable.

727

They're not like these here
Bay Ridge people at all.

You mean snobs
instead of slobs, right?

- What?
- Nothing.

Hey, you know, Bay Ridge
ain't the worst part of Brooklyn.

731
00:41:42,586 --> 00:41:43,669
You know what I'm talking?

732
00:41:43,754 --> 00:41:45,421
I mean, you know,
it ain't like a hellhole or nothing.

733
00:41:45,547 --> 00:41:48,299
Yeah, well, it ain't Manhattan.
It isn't Manhattan.

You got no idea how it changes,
you know.

Just right over there,
right across the river,

736
00:41:51,803 --> 00:41:53,971
everything is different,
completely different.

737
00:41:54,097 --> 00:41:55,556
It's beautiful, just beautiful.

738
00:41:55,641 --> 00:41:58,476
The people are beautiful,
offices are beautiful.

739
00:41:58,602 --> 00:42:01,270
The secretaries, you know,
they all shop at Bonwit Teller.

740

Oh, yeah?

741
00:42:02,606 --> 00:42:04,398
And, like, the lunch hours
are beautiful, too.

742
00:42:04,483 --> 00:42:07,818
Like, you know, they'll give you,
like, two hours for lunch

743
00:42:07,945 --> 00:42:09,612
- to do something that's related.
- Oh, yeah?

744
00:42:09,738 --> 00:42:12,532
Like we've seen
Zeffirelli's Romeo and Juliet.

745
00:42:12,616 --> 00:42:16,536
Over here. Romeo and Juliet, yeah?
I read that in high school.

746
00:42:16,620 --> 00:42:19,622
That's... That's Shakespeare, right?

747
00:42:19,748 --> 00:42:22,708
No, it's Zeffirelli,
the director of the movie.

748
00:42:22,793 --> 00:42:25,878
- You know, the movie? Film.
- Yeah.

749
00:42:25,963 --> 00:42:28,381
You know what?
What I never understood

750
00:42:28,465 --> 00:42:30,341
about that Romeo and Juliet,

751
00:42:30,467 --> 00:42:33,761
I never understood why Romeo,
he took the poison so quick, you know?

752
00:42:33,846 --> 00:42:36,514
I feel like he could have waited
or something.

753
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:39,642
Well, that's the way
they took the poison in those days.

754
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:43,896
Hey, you gonna eat?
Here, look at a menu.

755
00:42:43,981 --> 00:42:46,941
No, no. I'll just have tea.
Tea with lemon.

756
00:42:47,818 --> 00:42:51,529
I started drinking tea recently, you know.
It's really a lot more refined.

757
00:42:51,655 --> 00:42:53,364
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

758
00:42:53,490 --> 00:42:54,949
All those women executives
in my office,

759
00:42:55,033 --> 00:42:56,492
they all drink tea with lemon.

760
00:42:56,618 --> 00:43:00,121
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah. And you notice that I do, too.

761
00:43:00,205 --> 00:43:03,499
- I like coffee, you know? I drink coffee.
- Yeah.

762
00:43:07,004 --> 00:43:10,715
You see, like, I've only been
at this agency a really short time,

763
00:43:10,841 --> 00:43:15,469
but already I'm functioning in a, kind of,
public relations capacity, you know.

764
00:43:15,554 --> 00:43:18,181
I fill in for the agents
when they're elsewhere.

765
00:43:18,307 --> 00:43:20,725
Like, this week, you know, I had...

766
00:43:20,851 --> 00:43:23,728
I had business lunches
with Eric Clapton at La Cote Basque

767
00:43:23,854 --> 00:43:26,856
- and Cat Stevens at Le Madrigal.
- Oh, far out.

768
00:43:26,982 --> 00:43:30,359
Yeah. You heard of
those restaurants, huh?

769
00:43:30,485 --> 00:43:34,447
No, I don't know
those exact restaurants.

770
00:43:34,531 --> 00:43:35,740
I know the type.

771
00:43:35,866 --> 00:43:37,950
Yeah, but you must have heard
of the artists.

772
00:43:38,035 --> 00:43:40,953
No, I... Not... I don't know... You know.

773
00:43:41,038 --> 00:43:42,496
Not really.

774
00:43:43,207 --> 00:43:45,124
So what did you say «far out» for, huh?

775
00:43:45,209 --> 00:43:47,710
'Cause it sounded, like, far out.
Wasn't it? I mean...

776
00:43:47,836 --> 00:43:50,922
- Well, yeah.
- We'd like a lemon with some tea now.

777
00:43:51,048 --> 00:43:54,550
And I'd like a cheeseburger
and some coffee.

778
00:44:00,557 --> 00:44:02,600
Hey, you know who came
in the office the other day?

779
00:44:02,726 --> 00:44:04,727
- Who?
- Laurence Olivier.

780
00:44:04,853 --> 00:44:05,978
Who's that?

781
00:44:06,063 --> 00:44:09,357
Who's Laurence Olivier?
You don't know who he is?

782
00:44:09,441 --> 00:44:10,775
Laurence Olivier, man!

783
00:44:10,901 --> 00:44:12,985
He's the greatest actor
in the whole world.

784
00:44:13,070 --> 00:44:15,154
Oh, come on, you know who he is.

785
00:44:15,239 --> 00:44:16,447
He's the English actor,

786
00:44:16,573 --> 00:44:19,492
the one on television who does
all those Polaroid commercials.

787
00:44:19,576 --> 00:44:21,869
You know, Laurence Olivier.

788
00:44:21,954 --> 00:44:24,705
- Oh, him. Oh, he's good. He is good.
- Yeah.

789
00:44:24,790 --> 00:44:26,499
Well, anyway,
he comes in the office, right?

790
00:44:26,583 --> 00:44:28,167
So, I just do a few errands for him.

791
00:44:28,252 --> 00:44:30,419
So, he goes around,
he tells everybody in the entire office,

792
00:44:30,546 --> 00:44:31,754
he says I'm the brightest,

793
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:35,424
I'm the most vivacious thing
in the entire office he's seen in years.

794
00:44:35,551 --> 00:44:36,968
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

795
00:44:37,094 --> 00:44:41,681
Do you think that you could get, like,
a camera from him at a discount?

796
00:44:41,765 --> 00:44:44,433
I didn't ask him about a camera.

797
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:46,644
'Cause you got one already, right,
you sly fox, you.

798
00:44:46,770 --> 00:44:48,688
Hey, look, are you enjoying
all this stuff I'm telling you?

799
00:44:48,772 --> 00:44:50,147
Sure. I think it's good.

800
00:44:50,274 --> 00:44:52,650
Well, I just think maybe you can't handle
hearing about a kind of life

801
00:44:52,776 --> 00:44:55,820
that is so completely different
than yours.

802
00:44:55,946 --> 00:44:59,282
- You mean «better,» don't you?
- Yes, I mean better. Sure, it's better.

803
00:44:59,408 --> 00:45:01,117
Can I have some ketchup, please?

804
00:45:01,243 --> 00:45:03,035
I mean, I'm out of this scene
almost completely,

805
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:05,204
you know, this Bay Ridge scene.
I'm moving into Manhattan.

806
00:45:05,289 --> 00:45:07,748
I'm getting my own apartment.

807
00:45:07,833 --> 00:45:09,333
I'm changing.

808
00:45:09,459 --> 00:45:11,711
I'm really changing as a person,
and I'm growing.

809
00:45:11,795 --> 00:45:14,297
You know what I mean? Nobody has
any idea how much I'm growing.

810
00:45:14,423 --> 00:45:15,965
Why don't you go on a diet?

811
00:45:19,970 --> 00:45:22,138
(SIGHING)

812
00:45:22,306 --> 00:45:25,099
Okay, listen. I like you.
We could dance together.

813
00:45:25,184 --> 00:45:27,685
That's it. We could just dance together
and nothing more.

814
00:45:27,811 --> 00:45:29,937
Nothing personal.
I don't want you coming on to me.

815
00:45:30,022 --> 00:45:31,105
Why not?

816
00:45:31,190 --> 00:45:33,691
Because I don't date guys
like you anymore, for one thing.

817
00:45:33,817 --> 00:45:35,943
You're too young,
you haven't got any class, and, yeah,

818
00:45:36,028 --> 00:45:38,571
I'm sick of jerk-off guys
ain't got their shit together!

819
00:45:38,655 --> 00:45:41,324
Oh, come on.
It's easy to get your shit together.

820
00:45:41,450 --> 00:45:44,827
All you need is a salad bowl
and a potato masher.

821
00:45:45,704 --> 00:45:47,413
Get your shit together.

822
00:45:47,497 --> 00:45:50,124
- Would you like to know what I do?
- It's not necessary.

823
00:45:50,209 --> 00:45:51,959
I'll tell you what I do.

824
00:45:52,044 --> 00:45:55,213
I work in a paint store,
and I got a raise this week.

825
00:45:55,339 --> 00:45:57,089
Right. You work in a paint store, right?

826
00:45:57,174 --> 00:45:59,467
You probably live with your family,
you hang out with your buddies,

827
00:45:59,551 --> 00:46:02,470
and on Saturday night you go,
you blow it all off at 2001, right?

828
00:46:02,554 --> 00:46:05,181
- That's right.
- You're a cliché.

829
00:46:05,307 --> 00:46:08,184
You're nowhere,
on your way to no place.

830
00:46:11,855 --> 00:46:14,273
What do you got?
A fucking stairway to the stars or what?

831
00:46:14,358 --> 00:46:15,650
- Yeah, maybe.
- Yeah.

832
00:46:15,734 --> 00:46:17,318
I'm taking a course, nights,
at the new school.

833
00:46:17,402 --> 00:46:19,070
Next semester, I'm gonna take two.

834
00:46:19,196 --> 00:46:20,905
Now, you, you probably
didn't get no college, did you?

835
00:46:21,031 --> 00:46:22,198
No, I did not.

836
00:46:22,324 --> 00:46:24,116
Well, did you ever think
about going to college?

837
00:46:24,201 --> 00:46:25,576
- No.
- Not ever?

838
00:46:25,702 --> 00:46:27,453
- No. Did you?
- Well, not back then, no...

839
00:46:27,538 --> 00:46:29,497
Then why the fuck
are you bugging me about it for?

840
00:46:29,581 --> 00:46:31,666
Well, why not? Why didn't
you ever want to go to college?

841
00:46:31,750 --> 00:46:34,252
- Oh, just fuck off, will you? I did not.
- No, really. Tell me. Why not?

842
00:46:34,378 --> 00:46:36,546
Oh, Jesus Christ! I didn't!

843
00:46:41,051 --> 00:46:44,011
The thing is
the high I get at 2001 is just dancing,

844
00:46:44,096 --> 00:46:47,431
it's not being the best
or nothing like that.

845
00:46:47,558 --> 00:46:49,976
The only thing is
that I would like to get that high

846
00:46:50,060 --> 00:46:53,229
someplace else in my life. You know?

847
00:46:53,355 --> 00:46:54,897
Like where?

848
00:46:55,023 --> 00:46:58,442
I don't know where.
I don't know. Someplace.

849
00:46:58,569 --> 00:47:01,445
You see, dancing, it can't last forever.

850
00:47:01,572 --> 00:47:04,073
It's a short-lived kind of thing.

851
00:47:04,199 --> 00:47:06,617
But I'm getting older, you know.

852
00:47:08,245 --> 00:47:09,245
You know, I feel like...

853
00:47:09,371 --> 00:47:11,247
I feel like, you know,
so what, I'm getting older.

854
00:47:11,373 --> 00:47:13,916
Does that mean, like, I can't feel
that way about nothing left in my life?

855
00:47:14,042 --> 00:47:15,877
You know? ls that it?

856
00:47:15,961 --> 00:47:18,504
Listen, we gotta split here.

857
00:47:18,589 --> 00:47:20,965
No, I'll walk you the rest of the way.

858
00:47:21,091 --> 00:47:24,677
No, I'll meet you at the dance studio,
just like we said, okay?

859
00:47:24,761 --> 00:47:26,470
Stephanie, I can walk you home.

860
00:47:26,597 --> 00:47:29,432
Look, nothing personal, right?

861
00:47:29,558 --> 00:47:32,310
Oh, come on, Stephanie. I can walk you.

862
00:47:33,645 --> 00:47:37,273
Oh, Jesus Christ! You know?

863
00:47:45,157 --> 00:47:46,490
I don't know where he is.

864
00:47:46,617 --> 00:47:48,492
- Did you call him?
- No.

865
00:47:53,123 --> 00:47:54,832
What's the matter? What's going on?

866
00:47:54,958 --> 00:47:57,752
It's Gus, man. He's in the hospital.
The spics got him.

867
00:47:57,836 --> 00:47:59,504
- Spanish Barons?
- Barracudas.

868
00:47:59,630 --> 00:48:01,964
- Hey, that's my fucking car!
- Forget the car!

869
00:48:02,090 --> 00:48:04,008
- Save it for the spics.
- Just give me the keys.

870
00:48:04,134 --> 00:48:07,053
- You're asking for it.
- I can't believe it. I just saw him.

871
00:48:07,137 --> 00:48:09,847
He could have run, you know?
But he hung tight. That's Gus.

872
00:48:09,973 --> 00:48:12,016
TONY: Don't worry about it.
Okay? All right?

873
00:48:12,142 --> 00:48:13,809
I got in the hospital to see him.

874
00:48:13,936 --> 00:48:17,438
He got a broken nose, busted ribs,
a broken leg and four teeth knocked out.

875
00:48:17,523 --> 00:48:18,606
Shit.

876
00:48:18,690 --> 00:48:21,442
I mean, all he was doing was walking
along the street carrying his groceries,

877
00:48:21,527 --> 00:48:23,194
and three of them
do a shove number on him.

878
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:25,696
They spill his fucking groceries
into the street.

879
00:48:25,822 --> 00:48:28,783
So, he says under his breath,
«grease balls, spic dicks,»

880
00:48:28,867 --> 00:48:30,201
and they laid into him.

881
00:48:31,954 --> 00:48:35,665
(CAR HONKING)

882
00:48:42,130 --> 00:48:44,298
TONY: All right. Go check it out.

883
00:49:02,067 --> 00:49:04,068
Nobody in there, man.

884
00:49:08,031 --> 00:49:09,699
All right, all right.
This is what we're gonna do.

885
00:49:09,825 --> 00:49:10,908
We're just gonna cruise around

886
00:49:11,034 --> 00:49:12,827
until there's enough of them
that we can handle.

887
00:49:12,911 --> 00:49:15,037
BOBBY: Yeah, yeah, we'll just pick
off a couple on the street.

888
00:49:15,163 --> 00:49:16,998
- That's pussy, man!
- Fuck, man. Fuck.

889
00:49:17,082 --> 00:49:20,209
- You're fucked up!
- I'm sorry, guys.

890
00:49:20,335 --> 00:49:23,296
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

891
00:49:23,380 --> 00:49:24,714
You're sorry.

892
00:49:25,257 --> 00:49:27,675
Oh, forget it. We'll get them tomorrow.

893
00:49:31,430 --> 00:49:34,182
All right, dream good. Jerk off better.

894
00:49:36,894 --> 00:49:39,020
Tony, I'm getting married.

895
00:49:39,897 --> 00:49:41,230
Will you cut it with that shit?

896
00:49:41,356 --> 00:49:44,025
No, listen.
I just wanted to let you know, all right?

897
00:49:44,109 --> 00:49:45,526
All right. Look. If you get married,

898
00:49:45,611 --> 00:49:47,361
we'll all go with you
on your honeymoon, all right?

899
00:49:47,446 --> 00:49:50,781
- You will? Okay.
- Okay, good. Take it easy.

900
00:49:50,908 --> 00:49:53,367
Come on, Bobby. Get in the car.

901
00:49:54,077 --> 00:49:55,453
Hey.

902
00:49:55,579 --> 00:49:58,206
Hey, you know,
we should go to the hospital tomorrow.

903
00:49:58,290 --> 00:49:59,957
You know what I'm talking?

904
00:50:00,083 --> 00:50:03,544
And you, cool off! You know?

905
00:50:03,629 --> 00:50:05,588
All right. Good night.

906
00:50:28,737 --> 00:50:31,322
Tony, what did you say
to Father Frank, Jr.?

907
00:50:31,448 --> 00:50:33,658
- What?
- What did you say? What did you do?

908
00:50:33,784 --> 00:50:35,034
Yeah, what did you say?

909
00:50:35,118 --> 00:50:39,121
- What are you talking about?
- You must have said something to him.

910
00:50:39,248 --> 00:50:40,790
You sleep in the same room.
You talk to him.

911
00:50:40,874 --> 00:50:42,959
The next night he stays out all night,
he don't come back.

912
00:50:43,043 --> 00:50:45,962
- I said nothing to him.
- A priest staying out all night.

913
00:50:46,046 --> 00:50:47,463
A priest is not a priest no more,

914
00:50:47,548 --> 00:50:49,715
and he's grown up,
so he can do what he wants.

915
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:51,634
Something you said to him.

916
00:50:51,718 --> 00:50:54,178
Oh, yeah? You try and blame me
now he ain't a priest no more?

917
00:50:54,304 --> 00:50:55,972
You been writing to him.

918
00:50:56,056 --> 00:50:59,225
I don't believe this.
You're trying to hang this on me?

919
00:51:00,561 --> 00:51:03,312
Forget it, all right?
He called. He called. He called.

920
00:51:03,397 --> 00:51:06,482
In a couple of days
he's gonna see he's wrong.

921
00:51:06,567 --> 00:51:09,485
He's going through, like,
a trial of the soul, you know?

922
00:51:09,570 --> 00:51:11,237
He's going back to the church.
He's going back.

923
00:51:11,321 --> 00:51:12,864
No, he won't.
He's not going back to the church.

924
00:51:12,990 --> 00:51:14,323
Yes he is.
He's going back to the church!

925
00:51:14,408 --> 00:51:16,158
I'm telling you, he's going back!

926
00:51:17,494 --> 00:51:19,370
You know what?
You don't got a priest no more!

927
00:51:19,496 --> 00:51:20,580
And you got no saint!

928
00:51:20,664 --> 00:51:22,748
You got nothing
but three shit children now!

929
00:51:22,833 --> 00:51:24,834
Good. Good.

930
00:51:27,004 --> 00:51:28,171
FLO: (SOBBING) No.

931
00:51:34,845 --> 00:51:36,512
I'm sorry, Mom.

932
00:51:38,682 --> 00:51:40,183
I just...

933
00:51:41,018 --> 00:51:44,145
I didn't mean that. I'm sorry.
I'll never say that.

934
00:51:44,229 --> 00:51:46,689
I love you, Mom. I really do.

935
00:51:47,441 --> 00:51:49,442
Go on. Get out of here.

936
00:52:02,789 --> 00:52:04,290
- How you doing, Annette?
- Okay.

937
00:52:04,374 --> 00:52:05,750
- That's good.
- Yeah.

938
00:52:05,876 --> 00:52:10,254
Hey, listen, look, Annette.
I gotta tell you something, all right?

939
00:52:10,380 --> 00:52:13,341
It's very hard to tell you this, but...

940
00:52:13,425 --> 00:52:16,469
I changed my mind
about us dancing together.

941
00:52:16,553 --> 00:52:18,471
I got another partner.

942
00:52:22,059 --> 00:52:24,644
Look, it's professional.
You know what I mean? It's like...

943
00:52:24,728 --> 00:52:27,897
Things like this happen
when it's professional.

944
00:52:28,482 --> 00:52:31,609
Oh, Jesus Christ.
My fucking mother, now you.

945
00:52:32,152 --> 00:52:34,028
Why do you hate me so much?

946
00:52:34,112 --> 00:52:36,739
All I ever did to you was like you.

947
00:52:37,324 --> 00:52:39,242
Give me a break, huh?

948

(COUGHING)

949
00:52:54,424 --> 00:52:55,675
Hi.

950
00:52:55,759 --> 00:52:57,260
You're late.

951
00:52:57,928 --> 00:52:59,929
Five minutes. That's not late.

952
00:53:00,013 --> 00:53:01,472
How long you been here?

953
00:53:01,598 --> 00:53:03,933
I don't know.
Six, seven, something like that.

954
00:53:04,017 --> 00:53:06,394
Pete said you been here 15.

955
00:53:06,478 --> 00:53:08,604
Well, who's he?

956
00:53:08,689 --> 00:53:12,275
Hey, I got some records over here.
I don't know if you like them or not.

957
00:53:12,359 --> 00:53:15,611
- You like these guys?
- Yeah, yeah. Super.

958
00:53:16,864 --> 00:53:19,991
Do you do the New York hustle,
the Latin hustle, what?

959
00:53:20,117 --> 00:53:22,785
- New York, Latin, I do it all.
- Okay.

(MORE THAN A WOMAN PLAYING)

961
00:53:33,630 --> 00:53:37,842
Girl, I've known you very well
I've seen you growing every day

962
00:53:37,968 --> 00:53:42,638
I never really looked before
But now you take my breath away

963
00:53:42,723 --> 00:53:46,934
Suddenly you're in my life
A part of everything I do

964
00:53:47,019 --> 00:53:51,439
You got me working day and night
Just trying to keep a hold on you

965
00:53:51,523 --> 00:53:53,274
Follow me this time.

966
00:53:53,358 --> 00:53:56,652
I found my paradise

967
00:53:56,737 --> 00:54:00,198
My only chance for happiness

968
00:54:01,241 --> 00:54:03,367
And if I lose you now
I think I would die

969
00:54:03,493 --> 00:54:05,953
Yeah, that's really nice.
What'd you do, make that up?

970
00:54:06,038 --> 00:54:08,915
Yeah. Yeah. No, I saw it on TV first.

971
00:54:08,999 --> 00:54:10,958
Then I made it up.

972
00:54:11,043 --> 00:54:13,127
Hey, you know what? I know this one.
What I do is...

973
00:54:13,212 --> 00:54:16,339
Wait a minute. This is simple.
Let me just check something out.

(MUSIC STOPPING)

00:54:30,729 --> 00:54:33,773
- Come on. Come on.
- What you doing?

979
00:54:40,447 --> 00:54:42,573
Okay, stay right there.

(MORE THAN A WOMAN PLAYING)

981
00:54:52,209 --> 00:54:53,668
Now we can dance.

982
00:54:53,752 --> 00:54:55,419
Let me show you the step, okay?

983
00:54:55,546 --> 00:54:57,672
The Latin one I was
gonna show you, okay?

984
00:54:57,756 --> 00:55:01,133
Now, take your hand like this,
and count one, two, three.

985
00:55:01,218 --> 00:55:05,221
Two, two, three.
Three, two, three, kick, two, three.

986
00:55:06,473 --> 00:55:07,723
- Okay, I got that.
- Okay?

987
00:55:07,808 --> 00:55:09,559
- Looks good.
- All right.

More than a woman to me
Baby

989

- That's good. I like that.
- Yeah.

990
00:55:18,151 --> 00:55:20,444
- Do you know the tango hustle?
- Yeah, yeah.

991
00:55:20,571 --> 00:55:22,446
Okay, let's try that.

992

More than a woman

993
00:55:33,584 --> 00:55:38,629
There are stories old and true
Of people so in love like you and me

And I can see myself
Let history repeat itself

Reflecting how I feel for you
Thinking about those people then

This is the only way to go

I know I would die

Oh, say you'll always be my baby
We can make it shine

1002

We can take forever
Just a minute at a time

- Yeah.

No, no. Look, I really gotta go home.

1011
00:56:43,695 --> 00:56:46,864
You know something?
I like you when you're like this.

1012
00:56:46,990 --> 00:56:51,661
When you're quiet and you ain't laying
all that shit on me and everything.

Oh, yeah? Well, as a matter of fact,

1014

guess who I had lunch with today?
Paul Anka.

1015

I had to open my big mouth, right?

1016
00:56:57,501 --> 00:57:00,211
It was very interesting.
Very interesting. Very interesting.

Very, very intelligent fellow.

1018

You cream over that word,
«interesting,» don't you?

1019
00:57:05,342 --> 00:57:07,844
- Well, what's wrong with «interesting»?
- I don't know, something.

but I think you're full of shit.

- Yeah, except I'm not sure.

1023

and how much is bullshit.

Well, listen, when you figure it out,
just let me know, all right?

1025
00:57:23,777 --> 00:57:26,237
We should really practice
a couple more times.

1026
00:57:26,363 --> 00:57:28,489
Maybe go to 2001 with a crowd.

1027
00:57:28,574 --> 00:57:30,741
How about Saturday?
Would that be good?

ask you something, all right?

I don't know. I gotta know you better.
You know what I mean?

You got a way of putting things together,
you know?

Intelligent? Yeah, maybe.
Maybe intelligent.

1040
00:58:08,739 --> 00:58:10,615

how come we never talk

1044
00:58:16,330 --> 00:58:17,788
about how we feel when we're dancing?

1045

- How come we never talk about that?
- Good night and thanks.

No, maybe I could walk you
the rest of the way.

- Let me do that.
- Nope.

1048
00:58:28,008 --> 00:58:31,219
You shouldn't have asked.
You should have just done it.

1372
01:16:35,220 --> 01:16:37,346
She's a snotty bitch, man.

1373
01:16:37,973 --> 01:16:40,474
She's cool.
You just gotta get to know her, that's all.

1374
01:16:40,559 --> 01:16:42,560
Hey, Ton, did you fuck her, yet?

1375
01:16:42,644 --> 01:16:44,520
- What do you think?
- I don't think so.

1376
01:16:44,605 --> 01:16:47,398
You know, you guys got a lot
of growing up to do, you know that?

1377
01:16:47,482 --> 01:16:49,984
A lot of growing up. You're babies.

1378
01:16:50,569 --> 01:16:52,278
Yeah.

1379
01:16:52,362 --> 01:16:55,865
Hey, Mr. Fusco, look,
I need the afternoon off.

1380
01:16:55,949 --> 01:16:58,784
Sam's out. Harold's sick.
Here, take these.

1381
01:16:58,869 --> 01:17:01,704
- But I gotta, Mr. Fusco.
- Sorry, Tony.

1382
01:17:01,788 --> 01:17:03,998
Look, all I'm asking for
is one afternoon off.

1383
01:17:04,082 --> 01:17:06,292
I've been here almost eight months.
I didn't miss a day yet!

1384
01:17:06,376 --> 01:17:09,378
- Not today, Tony.
- Oh, come on, Mr. Fusco.

1385
01:17:09,463 --> 01:17:11,881
Some of those old farts,
they miss three, four days at a time,

1386
01:17:11,965 --> 01:17:13,174
you don't say nothing to them.

1387
01:17:13,258 --> 01:17:14,800
Hey, cool off.

1388
01:17:14,885 --> 01:17:17,428
Look, I got to have the afternoon off.
I'm taking it.

1389
01:17:17,513 --> 01:17:19,805
- You do, you're fired.
- I'm doing it.

1390
01:17:19,890 --> 01:17:23,226
- Then you're fired!
- Then fuck you, asshole!

1391
01:17:24,102 --> 01:17:26,270
And the fuck horse you rode in on.

1392
01:17:26,355 --> 01:17:28,022
- Fucking cocksucker asshole!
- Tony.

1393
01:17:28,106 --> 01:17:31,108
Tony, I don't wanna marry Pauline.
I don't give a fuck about this cunt.

1394
01:17:31,193 --> 01:17:34,070
- So, don't marry her!
- Tony, I gotta marry her!

1395
01:17:34,154 --> 01:17:35,780
Fuck it. She won't get the abortion.

1396
01:17:35,864 --> 01:17:38,616
- Everyone says I gotta marry her, Tony.
- Who says that?

1397
01:17:38,700 --> 01:17:41,118
Oh, fuck, her fucking parents,
my fucking parents.

1398
01:17:41,203 --> 01:17:43,204
The fucking priest on the corner.

1399
01:17:43,288 --> 01:17:46,040
Her fucking high school
guidance counselor.

1400
01:17:46,124 --> 01:17:48,501
Tony, I'm paralyzed.
I got no more control.

1401
01:17:48,585 --> 01:17:51,045
I mean, you and me, Tony,
we've been friends for so long.

1402
01:17:51,129 --> 01:17:53,089
I mean, I'm hurting.

1403
01:17:54,174 --> 01:17:57,176
Shit! You're always together.

1404
01:17:57,261 --> 01:18:00,096
And I'm always fucking up,
and you're always all right. You know?

1405
01:18:00,180 --> 01:18:03,683
I... Oh, come on.
Everybody fucks up. Really.

1406
01:18:03,767 --> 01:18:06,477
- Don't worry about nothing.
- You know, you're great.

1407
01:18:06,562 --> 01:18:08,855
I'm in a terrible rush.
I hate to leave you like this.

1408
01:18:08,939 --> 01:18:10,690
You got no idea
how much I appreciate this.

1409
01:18:10,774 --> 01:18:12,692
I mean, this car's very important
for me today, you know?

1410
01:18:12,776 --> 01:18:14,569
- Will you call me tonight?
- Yeah, I'll call you.

1411
01:18:14,653 --> 01:18:16,612
Don't worry about nothing, all right?
Take care.

1412
01:18:16,697 --> 01:18:19,365
- I'll talk to you later then?
- Yeah.

1413
01:18:19,449 --> 01:18:21,617
- Call me tonight, right?
- Yeah.

1414
01:18:21,702 --> 01:18:23,995
You're gonna call me tonight?

1415
01:18:29,877 --> 01:18:31,085
(CAR HONKING)

1416
01:18:58,030 --> 01:19:00,531
You know, Stephanie, this got me fired.

1417
01:19:00,616 --> 01:19:02,450
- What?
- This got me fired.

1418
01:19:02,534 --> 01:19:06,454
You know, you couldn't do it on Sunday,
so, my boss, he fired me.

1419
01:19:06,538 --> 01:19:08,497
Well, I just wanted
to get everything in, you know,

1420
01:19:08,582 --> 01:19:10,458
so I could start fixing up
when I move in on Saturday.

1421
01:19:10,542 --> 01:19:11,667
Yeah.

1422
01:19:11,752 --> 01:19:14,754
Nobody bitched at my office.
I got the whole day off.

1423
01:19:16,924 --> 01:19:18,382
Hey, I'm sorry.

1424
01:19:18,467 --> 01:19:21,761
Oh, it's all right. No problem.
No big deal. I can handle it.

1425
01:20:23,949 --> 01:20:26,367
Yeah, come on in.

1426
01:20:26,451 --> 01:20:29,120
Now, put that over here.

1427
01:20:29,872 --> 01:20:31,038
Hey!

1428
01:20:31,957 --> 01:20:33,624
I thought you were
gonna be out of town.

1429
01:20:33,709 --> 01:20:35,626
I postponed the trip.

1430
01:20:39,131 --> 01:20:41,883
Jay, this is Tony Manero. He's a friend.

1431
01:20:41,967 --> 01:20:45,219
- Tony, this is Jay Langhart.
- Unspecified status.

1432
01:20:45,304 --> 01:20:47,221
How do you do?

1433
01:20:47,306 --> 01:20:49,849
Well, I've decided to leave you
all the furniture.

1434
01:20:49,933 --> 01:20:52,059
What, are you kidding?
You're not gonna take any of this stuff?

1435
01:20:52,144 --> 01:20:54,854
No, I'm gonna start fresh. What the hell,
you picked out most of it anyway.

1436
01:20:54,938 --> 01:20:57,523
- Well, super.
- Stephanie, I told you not to say «super.»

1437
01:20:57,608 --> 01:21:00,359
Nobody says «super» anymore.

1438
01:21:00,444 --> 01:21:03,696
Can I get you a beer? Glass of wine?

1439
01:21:03,780 --> 01:21:06,240
No, man, it's all right.

1440
01:21:06,325 --> 01:21:08,618
Hey, I read that book you told me to.
You know, the...

1441
01:21:08,702 --> 01:21:10,536
Kerr or the Lawson?

1442
01:21:10,621 --> 01:21:13,623
- The Kerr.
- Should have read the Lawson.

1443
01:21:14,958 --> 01:21:19,295
Listen, if I can help you guys move in,
you just say the word. Be glad to help.

1444
01:21:21,840 --> 01:21:23,216
(DOOR CLOSING)

1445
01:21:27,721 --> 01:21:30,097
I'll get the rest of the stuff.

1446
01:21:41,360 --> 01:21:43,653
Stephanie, who is that guy?

1447
01:21:43,737 --> 01:21:47,698
He's an arranger, a record producer.
He wants to do films.

1448
01:21:47,783 --> 01:21:50,535
He's gonna move now
to a more expensive apartment.

1449
01:21:50,619 --> 01:21:52,578
I met him at the agency.

1450
01:21:52,663 --> 01:21:54,830
He didn't want his wife
to know how much money he had

1451
01:21:54,915 --> 01:21:57,208
until the divorce was final.

1452
01:21:58,335 --> 01:21:59,502
Come on. Let's go.

1453
01:21:59,586 --> 01:22:03,464
I mean, who is he to you, Stephanie?
That's what I'm talking about.

1454
01:22:04,633 --> 01:22:07,552
He's a friend of mine, okay?
He's a friend.

1455
01:22:08,470 --> 01:22:11,556
And I was living with him
for a little while.

1456
01:22:11,640 --> 01:22:14,016
Are you in love with this man or what?
I mean, tell me the story.

1457
01:22:14,101 --> 01:22:17,311
- That's all I'm asking, is the story.
- No, I'm not. We had a thing.

1458
01:22:17,396 --> 01:22:19,605
You know?
It didn't work out, and it's over now,

1459
01:22:19,690 --> 01:22:21,816
and he's my friend, and he still likes me.

1460
01:22:21,900 --> 01:22:23,568
He likes you. He likes you to have...

1461
01:22:23,652 --> 01:22:25,945
To have you around for a quick piece
when he feels like it.

1462
01:22:26,029 --> 01:22:28,656
He helped me, man. You don't know
what it's like at that place.

1463
01:22:28,740 --> 01:22:31,117
It's crazy. You don't know shit!

1464
01:22:31,201 --> 01:22:35,121
You know? I didn't know how to do stuff,
so I'd go to him and I would ask him,

1465
01:22:35,205 --> 01:22:37,331
and he would tell me how to do things.

1466
01:22:37,416 --> 01:22:39,709
And then I'd go back to work
and everything would be all right.

1467
01:22:39,793 --> 01:22:41,669
Otherwise, I'd be walking around
like an idiot,

1468
01:22:41,753 --> 01:22:43,921
going, «I don't know. I don't know.
I don't know.»

1469
01:22:44,006 --> 01:22:46,007
- And he helps me. He does.
- Yeah, he helps you. Helps you what?

1470
01:22:46,091 --> 01:22:48,551
Get in and out of the sack?
ls that what he helps you do?

1471
01:22:48,635 --> 01:22:50,178
- He helped me.
- Sure.

1472
01:22:50,262 --> 01:22:52,555
What the hell do you
expect me to do, man?

1473
01:22:52,639 --> 01:22:55,641
What do you expect me to do?
He helped me.

1474
01:23:05,194 --> 01:23:07,904
Don't cry about it. I mean, you know.

1475
01:23:07,988 --> 01:23:11,032
All right, so he helped you.
That's good for you.

1476
01:23:14,828 --> 01:23:17,580
All right. Come on. Let's get out of here.

1477
01:23:18,540 --> 01:23:19,916
STEPHANIE: (SOBBING) I'm sorry.

1478
01:23:21,543 --> 01:23:23,544
TONY: It's all right.
Don't worry about nothing.

1479
01:23:23,629 --> 01:23:26,714
Don't worry about that.
Don't worry about nothing.

1480
01:23:26,798 --> 01:23:28,549
Stephanie, don't.

1481
01:23:30,052 --> 01:23:32,470
Look, we'll stop here for a while.
We'll sit down. All right?

1482
01:23:32,554 --> 01:23:34,805
Don't stop. Just take me home.
Just take me home, man.

1483
01:23:34,890 --> 01:23:36,599
No, come on, we'll sit here
for a while, all right?

1484
01:23:36,683 --> 01:23:39,101
Just, don't worry about nothing.

1485
01:23:45,442 --> 01:23:47,360
It's pretty, isn't it?

1486
01:23:54,493 --> 01:23:55,952
Sit down.

1487
01:24:08,090 --> 01:24:10,299
You know how tall that bridge is?

1488
01:24:10,384 --> 01:24:13,886
That bridge, that tower right there,
goes up 690 feet.

1489
01:24:14,596 --> 01:24:18,015
They got 40 million cars
going across there a year.

1490
01:24:18,350 --> 01:24:22,645
127,000 tons of steel is involved in that.

1491
01:24:23,689 --> 01:24:24,939
The concrete there,

1492
01:24:25,023 --> 01:24:28,985
they got almost three-quarter
of a million yards of concrete.

1493
01:24:29,069 --> 01:24:30,194
That's right.

1494
01:24:30,279 --> 01:24:34,907
The center span, right there,
is 4,260 feet long.

1495
01:24:34,992 --> 01:24:37,743
And with the on-ramps,
it all together totals, like,

1496
01:24:37,828 --> 01:24:40,246
something like 2.5 miles.

1497
01:24:41,665 --> 01:24:44,083
You know all about the bridge,
don't you?

1498
01:24:44,168 --> 01:24:46,043
That's right.

1499
01:24:46,128 --> 01:24:48,504
I know everything about that bridge.

1500
01:24:48,589 --> 01:24:52,633
You know what else?
They got a guy buried in the cement.

1501
01:24:53,385 --> 01:24:54,886
Yeah?

1502
01:24:55,846 --> 01:24:57,930
Know how it happened?

1503
01:24:58,015 --> 01:25:00,433
Well, they was working on it,
apparently, at the time.

1504
01:25:00,517 --> 01:25:03,686
And they, I guess,
they were pouring the cement,

1505
01:25:03,770 --> 01:25:05,313
and he slipped off, you know,

1506
01:25:05,397 --> 01:25:09,400
on the upper part of the bridge
and, you know, fell in.

1507
01:25:12,237 --> 01:25:13,738
Dumb fuck.

1508
01:25:14,156 --> 01:25:16,365
- What a way to go.
- I come down here a lot.

1509
01:25:16,450 --> 01:25:18,451
You know, I get ideas.

1510
01:25:18,535 --> 01:25:21,162
Oh, yeah? What kind of ideas you get?

1511
01:25:21,830 --> 01:25:25,291
I don't know, daydreams, you know?
I daydream a lot.

1512
01:25:50,734 --> 01:25:53,152
Mr. Fusco, I come for what I got coming.

1513
01:25:53,237 --> 01:25:54,529
Tony. Come on.

1514
01:25:54,613 --> 01:25:57,156
Things got a little hot under the collar,
don't you think?

1515
01:25:57,241 --> 01:25:58,533
What are you talking about?

1516
01:25:58,617 --> 01:26:00,952
I don't want to lose you, Tony.
You're a good kid.

1517
01:26:01,036 --> 01:26:04,455
Customers like you.

01:57:29,258 --> 01:57:32,969
You're my savior when I fall

1972
01:57:33,929 --> 01:57:38,307
And you may not think
I care for you

1973
01:57:38,433 --> 01:57:43,145
When you know down inside
That I really do

1974
01:57:43,230 --> 01:57:46,732
And it's me you need to show

1975
01:57:47,150 --> 01:57:48,484
How deep is your love

1976
01:57:48,569 --> 01:57:52,989
How deep is your love
How deep is your love

1977
01:57:53,073 --> 01:57:55,491
Well, you can tell
By the way I use my walk

1978
01:57:55,617 --> 01:57:57,994
I'm a woman's man
No time to talk

1979
01:57:58,120 --> 01:58:00,079
Music loud
And women warm

1980
01:58:00,163 --> 01:58:02,748
I've been kicked around
Since I was born

1981
01:58:02,833 --> 01:58:05,001
And now it's all right
It's okay

1982
01:58:05,127 --> 01:58:07,503
You may look the other way

1983
01:58:07,629 --> 01:58:09,922
And we can try
To understand

1984
01:58:10,007 --> 01:58:12,258
The New York Times' effect on man

1985
01:58:12,342 --> 01:58:14,427
Whether you're a brother
Or whether you're a mother

1986
01:58:14,511 --> 01:58:16,929
You're stayin' alive
Stayin' alive

1987
01:58:17,014 --> 01:58:19,098
Feel the city breaking
And everybody shaking

1988
01:58:19,183 --> 01:58:21,517
And we're stayin' alive
Stayin' alive

1989
01:58:23,770 --> 01:58:35,781
Stayin' alive

1990
01:58:42,206 --> 01:58:44,790
Well, now, I get low
And I get high

1991
01:58:44,875 --> 01:58:47,210
And if I can't get either
I really try

1992
01:58:47,336 --> 01:58:49,295
Got the wings of heaven
On my shoes

1993
01:58:49,379 --> 01:58:51,797
I'm a dancing man
And I just can't lose

1994
01:58:51,882 --> 01:58:54,050
You know it's all right
It's okay

1995
01:58:54,176 --> 01:58:56,552
I'll live to see another day

1996
01:58:56,678 --> 01:58:58,721
We can try
To understand

1997
01:58:58,847 --> 01:59:00,681
The New York Times' effect on man

1998
01:59:01,000 --> 01:59:04,125
