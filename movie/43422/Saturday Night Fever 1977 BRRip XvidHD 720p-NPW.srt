You live with your family,

744
00:45:58,244 --> 00:45:59,983
you hang out with your
buddies and on Saturday

745
00:45:59,996 --> 00:46:01,746
night you go, you blow
it off at 2001, right?

746
00:46:01,813 --> 00:46:04,983
That's right.
You're a cliché.

747
00:46:05,050 --> 00:46:07,986
You're nowhere.
On your way to no place.

748
00:46:11,290 --> 00:46:14,226
What do you got? A fuckin'
stairway to the stars, or what?

749
00:46:14,294 --> 00:46:17,029
Yeah, maybe. I'm taking a course
nights at the new school.

750
00:46:17,097 --> 00:46:19,064
Next semester,
I'm gonna take two.

751
00:46:19,132 --> 00:46:21,967
Now, you, you probably didn't get
no college, did you? No, I did not.

752
00:46:22,035 --> 00:46:24,403
Well, did you ever think
about going to college? No.

753
00:46:24,470 --> 00:46:26,405
Not ever?
No. Did you?

754
00:46:26,472 --> 00:46:29,342
Not back then-- then what you
bugging me about it for?

755
00:46:29,410 --> 00:46:31,978
Why didn't you
ever want to go?

756
00:46:32,046 --> 00:46:34,197
Just fuck off, will ya?
Well, tell me, why not?

757
00:46:34,264 --> 00:46:36,983
Jesus Christ! I didn't.

758
00:46:40,738 --> 00:46:43,908
The thing is, the high I get
at 2001 is just dancin'.

759
00:46:43,976 --> 00:46:47,344
It's not being the best
or nothing like that.

760
00:46:47,412 --> 00:46:51,248
The only thing is that I-I would like to
get that high someplace else in my life.

761
00:46:51,316 --> 00:46:54,652
You know?
Like where?

762
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:58,623
I don't know where.
I don't know. Someplace.

763
00:46:58,692 --> 00:47:03,829
You see, dancin', it can't last forever.
It's a short-lived thing.

764
00:47:03,897 --> 00:47:05,831
But, I'm getting older,
you know.

765
00:47:08,201 --> 00:47:11,171
You know, I feel like-- I feel
like, so what, I'm gettin' older.

766
00:47:11,238 --> 00:47:14,340
Does that mean, like, I can't feel that
way about nothin' left in my life?

767
00:47:14,408 --> 00:47:18,377
Is that it? Listen, uh,
we gotta split here.

768
00:47:18,445 --> 00:47:21,313
No, I'll walk you
the rest of the way.

769
00:47:21,381 --> 00:47:24,384
No, I'll meet you at the dance
studio, just like we said.

770
00:47:24,452 --> 00:47:29,623
Stephanie, I can walk you home.
Look, nothing personal, right?

771
00:47:29,691 --> 00:47:33,761
Oh, come on, Stephanie.
I could walk you.

772
00:47:33,829 --> 00:47:37,297
Aw, Jesus Christ!
You know?

773
00:47:45,141 --> 00:47:48,476
I don't know where he is.
Did you call him? No.

774
00:47:52,599 --> 00:47:54,851
What's the matter?
What's goin' on?

775
00:47:54,918 --> 00:47:57,754
It's Gus, man. He's in the hospital.
The spics got him.

776
00:47:57,821 --> 00:47:59,756
Spanish barons?
Barracudas.

777
00:47:59,823 --> 00:48:02,158
That's my fucking car!
Your car?

778
00:48:02,226 --> 00:48:04,227
Save it for the spics.
Give me the keys.

779
00:48:04,294 --> 00:48:07,064
You're asking for it. I can't believe it.
I just saw him.

780
00:48:07,132 --> 00:48:09,783
[Double j.] He could've run, you know?
But he hung tight. That's Gus.

781
00:48:09,850 --> 00:48:12,035
[Tony]
Don't worry about it.

782
00:48:12,103 --> 00:48:15,872
I got in the hospital to see him.
He got a broken nose, busted ribs,

783
00:48:15,940 --> 00:48:18,609
a broken leg and four
teeth knocked out. Shit.

784
00:48:18,676 --> 00:48:21,045
All he was doin' was walking along
the street carrying his groceries,

785
00:48:21,113 --> 00:48:23,180
and three of 'em
do a shove number on him.

786
00:48:23,249 --> 00:48:25,683
They spill his fuckin'
groceries into the street.

787
00:48:25,751 --> 00:48:30,288
So, he says under his breath, "greaseballs,
spic dicks," and they laid into him.

788
00:48:30,356 --> 00:48:32,857
[Tires screeching]
[Horn honks]

789
00:48:41,651 --> 00:48:44,820
[Tony]
All right. Go check it out.

790
00:49:01,839 --> 00:49:03,841
Nobody in there, man.

791
00:49:07,679 --> 00:49:09,680
All right, all right.
This is what we're gonna do.

792
00:49:09,748 --> 00:49:12,416
We're just gonna cruise around until
there's enough of them that we can handle.

793
00:49:12,483 --> 00:49:15,019
<i>Yeah, we'll just pick off
a couple on the street.</i>

794
00:49:15,087 --> 00:49:17,487
Aw, you-- that's pussy, man!
You're fucked up! Fuck, man.

795
00:49:17,556 --> 00:49:23,428
There was no one there, Joey. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

796
00:49:23,495 --> 00:49:26,832
You're sorry. Aw, forget it.
We'll get 'em tomorrow.

797
00:49:31,170 --> 00:49:34,340
All right, dream good.
Jerk off better.

798
00:49:36,676 --> 00:49:41,147
Tony? I'm gettin' married. Will
you cut it with that shit?

799
00:49:41,215 --> 00:49:44,016
No, listen. I just wanted
to let you know, all right?

800
00:49:44,084 --> 00:49:47,254
Look. If you get married, we'll all go
with you on your honeymoon, all right?

801
00:49:47,321 --> 00:49:50,657
You will? Okay. Take it easy. [Laughs]

Come on, Bobby.
Get in the car.

Hey, you know, we should go
to the hospital tomorrow.

And you, cool off!

Good night.

[Utensils clattering]

807
00:50:28,682 --> 00:50:30,289
Tony, what did you say
to father Frank Jr.?

808
00:50:30,302 --> 00:50:31,918
What?

809
00:50:31,985 --> 00:50:34,854
What did you say? What did you do?
Yeah, what did you say?

810
00:50:34,922 --> 00:50:38,658
What are you talking about? You
must have said something to him.

811
00:50:38,726 --> 00:50:40,760
You sleep in the same room.
You talk to him.

812
00:50:40,828 --> 00:50:44,215
The next night he stays out all night. He
don't come back. I said nothing to him.

813
00:50:44,283 --> 00:50:47,351
A priest staying out all night. A
priest is not a priest no more.

814
00:50:47,419 --> 00:50:49,492
And he's grown up, so he
can do what he wants.

815
00:50:49,505 --> 00:50:51,589
Something you said to him.

816
00:50:51,657 --> 00:50:53,463
You try and blame me now
he ain't a priest no more?

817
00:50:53,476 --> 00:50:55,293
You were writin' to him.

trying to hang this on me!

Forget it, all right?
He called. He called.

820
00:51:03,102 --> 00:51:06,738
In a couple of days
he's gonna see he's wrong.

821
00:51:06,806 --> 00:51:08,946
He's goin' through, like, a
trial of the soul, you know?

822
00:51:08,959 --> 00:51:11,109
He's goin' back to the church.

No, he won't. He's not goin' back.
He is. He's goin' back!

00:51:14,948 --> 00:51:19,985
He's goin' back! He's not ever goin' back!
You don't got a priest no more!

about us dancin' together.

and have some coffee with him.

1181
01:15:13,654 --> 01:15:15,393
You had coffee with Joe namath?
Yeah, that's right.

1182
01:15:15,406 --> 01:15:17,156
We were talking a little.

1183
01:15:17,223 --> 01:15:20,092
He wanted to know
what it was like to be 21.

1184
01:15:20,160 --> 01:15:22,116
I told him I didn't know
because I was just 20.

1185
01:15:22,129 --> 01:15:24,097
Yeah, what else?

1186
01:15:24,165 --> 01:15:26,366
That's all.
Ain't that enough?

1187
01:15:26,434 --> 01:15:28,869
Hey, don't you never chew, Tony?
Don't you never chew?

1188
01:15:28,937 --> 01:15:31,638
Hey, look, when my mother dies,
I'll give you the job, all right?

1189
01:15:31,706 --> 01:15:32,928
You know what's goin'
down your throat, man?

1190
01:15:32,941 --> 01:15:34,174
Big chunks of hamburger.

1191
01:15:34,241 --> 01:15:37,310
Big gobs. Like dog food.
Dog friskies. Dog yummies.

1192
01:15:37,378 --> 01:15:41,916
<i>You know something, Joey? He's
gonna turn into a dog. [Barks]</i>

[Both barking]

1194
01:15:55,432 --> 01:15:58,117
Stephanie, listen, can I
talk to you for a second?

1195
01:15:58,184 --> 01:16:00,519
I was listening to what you said in
there before, and you seem to know...

1196
01:16:00,586 --> 01:16:04,589
A lot of people and a lot of
places and a lot of things.

1197
01:16:04,657 --> 01:16:07,727
Um, I got a friend of mine, you
know, he's a very good friend...

1198
01:16:07,795 --> 01:16:09,862
And he-he got
a girl pregnant.

1199
01:16:09,931 --> 01:16:14,000
He got a girl pregnant, and I wanted
to know if you had to make a choice...

1200
01:16:14,068 --> 01:16:18,238
Between getting an abortion and have to get
married to somebody, what would you do?

1201
01:16:18,306 --> 01:16:22,143
Well, who'd
I have to marry?

1202
01:16:22,210 --> 01:16:25,212
You'd have to marry me.
You'd have to marry me. Yeah.

1203
01:16:25,280 --> 01:16:27,648
I think I'd get an abortion.
So long, Tony.

1204
01:16:27,715 --> 01:16:30,651
It's very nice meeting you.

1205
01:16:30,718 --> 01:16:32,753
So what'd you guys
think of her?

1206
01:16:32,821 --> 01:16:34,374
Hey, Tony, I liked her.
I thought she was nice.

1207
01:16:34,400 --> 01:16:35,015
I liked her a lot.

1208
01:16:35,058 --> 01:16:38,059
She's a snotty bitch, man.

1209
01:16:38,127 --> 01:16:41,496
She's cool. You just gotta get to know her.

1210
01:16:41,564 --> 01:16:44,633
<i>Did you fuck her, yet? I don't think so.
What do you think?</i>

1211
01:16:44,700 --> 01:16:47,223
You guys got a lot of growing
up to do, you know that?

1212
01:16:47,249 --> 01:16:48,762
A lot of growing. You're babies.

1213
01:16:48,805 --> 01:16:50,506
[Laughing]

1214
01:16:52,042 --> 01:16:54,477
<i>- [Tony] Hey, Mr. fusco? - Mm?</i>

1215
01:16:54,545 --> 01:16:58,748
I need the afternoon off. Sam's out.
Harold's sick. Here, take these.

1216
01:16:58,816 --> 01:17:01,984
But-but, I gotta, mister fusco.
Sorry, Tony.

1217
01:17:02,052 --> 01:17:04,120
Look, all I'm asking for
is one afternoon off.

1218
01:17:04,188 --> 01:17:06,356
I've been here almost eight months.
I didn't miss a day yet!

1219
01:17:06,424 --> 01:17:09,560
Not today, Tony.
Come on, Mr. fusco.

1220
01:17:09,627 --> 01:17:11,261
Some of those old
farts, they-- they miss

1221
01:17:11,287 --> 01:17:13,154
three, four days you don't
say nothing to them.

1222
01:17:13,197 --> 01:17:17,367
Hey, cool off. Look, I gotta have
the afternoon off. I'm takin' it.

1223
01:17:17,435 --> 01:17:19,771
You do, you're fired.
I'm doin' it.

1224
01:17:19,839 --> 01:17:23,007
Then you're fired!
Then fuck you, asshole!

1225
01:17:23,075 --> 01:17:26,210
And the horse
you rode in on.

1226
01:17:26,278 --> 01:17:28,279
Fuckin' cocksucker asshole!
Hey, Tony.

1227
01:17:28,347 --> 01:17:31,282
Tony, I-I don't wanna marry pauline.
I don't give a fuck about this cunt.

1228
01:17:31,350 --> 01:17:34,067
So, don't marry her!
Tony, I gotta marry her!

1229
01:17:34,093 --> 01:17:35,746
She won't get the abortion.

1230
01:17:35,789 --> 01:17:38,724
Everyone says I gotta marry her.
Who says that?

1231
01:17:38,792 --> 01:17:41,543
Oh, fuck, her fuckin'
parents, my fuckin' parents.

1232
01:17:41,569 --> 01:17:43,186
Fuckin' priest on the corner.

1233
01:17:43,229 --> 01:17:46,131
Her fuckin' high school
guidance counselor.

1234
01:17:46,200 --> 01:17:48,468
Tony, I'm paralyzed.
I got no more control.

1235
01:17:48,536 --> 01:17:53,373
I mean, you and me, Tony, we've been
friends for so long-- I mean, I'm hurtin'.

1236
01:17:53,440 --> 01:17:57,744
Shit! You're always--
you're always together.

1237
01:17:57,812 --> 01:18:00,481
I'm always fucking up and you're
always all right, you know?

1238
01:18:00,549 --> 01:18:02,583
I nev-- oh, come on.
Everybody fucks up.

1239
01:18:02,651 --> 01:18:06,654
Really. Don't worry about nothin'.
You-you're great.

1240
01:18:06,722 --> 01:18:09,056
I'm in a terrible rush.
I hate to leave you like this.

1241
01:18:09,124 --> 01:18:11,066
You've got no idea how
much I appreciate this.

1242
01:18:11,092 --> 01:18:12,785
I mean, this car's
real important today.

1243
01:18:12,828 --> 01:18:14,580
Will you call me tonight?
Yeah, I'll call you.

1244
01:18:14,606 --> 01:18:16,023
I'll call. Don't
worry 'bout nothin'.

1245
01:18:16,065 --> 01:18:19,501
Take care. Yeah. I'll
talk to you later then?

1246
01:18:19,568 --> 01:18:21,770
Call me tonight, right?
Yeah.

1247
01:18:21,838 --> 01:18:23,956
You're gonna
call me tonight?

[Horn honks]

1249
01:18:57,977 --> 01:19:00,511
Hey, you know, Stephanie,
this got me fired. What?

1250
01:19:00,580 --> 01:19:06,417
This got me fired. You couldn't do it on
Sunday, so, uh, my boss, he fired me.

1251
01:19:06,485 --> 01:19:10,655
Well, I just wanted to get everything in so
I could start fixin' up when I moved in.

1252
01:19:10,723 --> 01:19:14,093
Yeah. Nobody bitched at my office.
I got the whole day off.

1253
01:19:14,160 --> 01:19:18,330
[Engine starts]
Hey, I'm sorry.

1254
01:19:18,398 --> 01:19:22,668
Oh, it's all right. No problem.
No big deal. I can handle it.

1255
01:20:23,619 --> 01:20:26,287
Come on in.

1256
01:20:26,354 --> 01:20:29,624
Now, put that over here.

1257
01:20:29,691 --> 01:20:32,026
Hey!

1258
01:20:32,093 --> 01:20:35,095
I thought you were gonna be out of town?
I postponed the trip.

1259
01:20:38,501 --> 01:20:41,837
Um, Jay, this is Tony manero.
He's a friend.

1260
01:20:41,905 --> 01:20:45,140
Tony, this is Jay langhart.
Unspecified status.

1261
01:20:45,207 --> 01:20:47,375
How do you do?

1262
01:20:47,444 --> 01:20:49,558
Well, I've decided to leave
you all the furniture.

1263
01:20:49,584 --> 01:20:50,537
What, are you kidding?

1264
01:20:50,580 --> 01:20:53,049
You're not gonna take any of this stuff?
I'm gonna start fresh.

1265
01:20:53,116 --> 01:20:55,885
You picked out most of it anyway.
Well, super.

1266
01:20:55,953 --> 01:21:00,289
Stephanie, I told you not to say super.
Nobody says super anymore.

1267
01:21:00,357 --> 01:21:03,860
Uh, can I get you a beer?
Glass of wine?

1268
01:21:03,928 --> 01:21:06,029
No, man,
it's all right.

1269
01:21:06,097 --> 01:21:10,534
<i>Hey, I read that book you told me to.
You know, the-- kerr or the Lawson?</i>

1270
01:21:10,602 --> 01:21:14,572
The kerr.
Should've read the Lawson.

1271
01:21:14,639 --> 01:21:19,994
Listen, if I can help you guys move in,
you just say the word. Be glad to help.

1272
01:21:26,969 --> 01:21:29,871
I'll get the rest
of the stuff.

1273
01:21:41,168 --> 01:21:43,669
Stephanie,
who is that guy?

1274
01:21:43,737 --> 01:21:47,740
He's an arranger, a record producer.
He wants to do films.

1275
01:21:47,807 --> 01:21:51,114
Uh, he's going to move to a
more expensive apartment.

1276
01:21:51,140 --> 01:21:52,670
I met him at the agency.

1277
01:21:52,713 --> 01:21:58,451
He didn't want his wife to know how much
money he had until the divorce was final.

1278
01:21:58,519 --> 01:22:00,889
Come on. Let's go. I
mean, who is he to you?

1279
01:22:00,915 --> 01:22:02,548
That's what I'm talkin' about.

1280
01:22:04,793 --> 01:22:07,962
He's a friend of mine,
okay? He's a friend.

1281
01:22:08,030 --> 01:22:10,298
And I was living with him
for a little while.

1282
01:22:11,800 --> 01:22:13,935
Are you in love with this man, or what?
Tell me the story.

1283
01:22:14,003 --> 01:22:17,472
That's all I'm asking, is the story.
No, I'm not. We had a thing.

1284
01:22:17,540 --> 01:22:20,542
It didn't work out. It's over
now and he's my friend...

1285
01:22:20,610 --> 01:22:22,894
And he still likes me. He likes you.
He likes

1286
01:22:22,920 --> 01:22:24,905
to have you around
for a quick piece...

1287
01:22:24,948 --> 01:22:27,082
When he feels like it.
He helped me, man.

1288
01:22:27,149 --> 01:22:29,189
You don't know what it's
like at that place.

1289
01:22:29,215 --> 01:22:30,710
It's crazy. You don't know shit!

1290
01:22:30,753 --> 01:22:35,058
You know? I didn't know how to do stuff,
so I'd go to him and I would ask him,

1291
01:22:35,126 --> 01:22:37,527
and he would tell me
how to do things.

1292
01:22:37,594 --> 01:22:39,595
Then I'd go back to work and
everything would be all right.

1293
01:22:39,663 --> 01:22:41,664
Otherwise, I'd be
walking around like an idiot,

1294
01:22:41,732 --> 01:22:43,866
going, "I don't know.
I don't know. I don't know."

1295
01:22:43,934 --> 01:22:46,060
He helps me. He does. He helps you.
Helps you what?

1296
01:22:46,086 --> 01:22:47,229
Get in and out of the sack?

1297
01:22:47,272 --> 01:22:50,107
[Groans] He helped me. Is
that what he helps you do?

1298
01:22:50,175 --> 01:22:52,643
What the hell do you
expect me to do, man?

1299
01:22:52,710 --> 01:22:56,713
What do you expect me to do?
He helped me. [Crying]

1300
01:23:05,124 --> 01:23:08,961
Don't cry about it. I mean, you
know-- all right, so he helped you.

1301
01:23:09,028 --> 01:23:12,864
That's good for you.

1302
01:23:14,734 --> 01:23:17,803
All right. Come on. Let's get out of here.
[Engine starts]

1303
01:23:17,871 --> 01:23:22,708
<i>[Stephanie] I'm sorry.
It's all right.</i>

1304
01:23:22,776 --> 01:23:25,459
Don't worry about nothin'.
Don't worry about that.

1305
01:23:25,485 --> 01:23:26,904
Don't worry about nothin'.

1306
01:23:26,947 --> 01:23:29,883
Stephanie, don't.

1307
01:23:29,951 --> 01:23:32,386
Look, we'll stop here for a while.
We'll sit down. All right?

1308
01:23:32,454 --> 01:23:35,389
Don't stop. Just take me home.
Just take me home, man.

1309
01:23:35,457 --> 01:23:38,959
We'll sit here for a while, all right?
Don't worry about nothin'.

1310
01:23:45,368 --> 01:23:47,869
It's pretty, isn't it?

1311
01:23:54,543 --> 01:23:56,545
Sit down.

1312
01:24:08,125 --> 01:24:10,126
You know how tall
that bridge is?

1313
01:24:10,193 --> 01:24:14,431
That bridge-- that tower
right there goes up 690 feet.

1314
01:24:14,499 --> 01:24:18,201
They got 40 million cars
going across there a year.

1315
01:24:18,269 --> 01:24:23,773
A hundred twenty-seven thousand
tons of steel is involved in that.

1316
01:24:23,841 --> 01:24:25,966
The concrete there,
they got almost

1317
01:24:25,992 --> 01:24:28,704
Three-quarter of a million
yards of concrete.

1318
01:24:28,747 --> 01:24:31,916
That's right.
The center span, right there,

1319
01:24:31,983 --> 01:24:35,053
is 4,260 feet long.

1320
01:24:35,120 --> 01:24:37,610
And with the on-ramps,
it all together totals

1321
01:24:37,623 --> 01:24:40,125
something like two
and one-half Miles.
