2
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:54,472
- Hi, Tony! Two or three?
- Two. Give me two. That`s good.

3
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,795
Do you do lay-away?

4
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,833
If it doesn`t turn into
a 20-year mortgage.

5
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:52,999
Here`s five dollars for the blue shirt
in the window. Hold it for me.

6
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,760
- Wait for your receipt!
- I trust you.

7
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:58,190
Please don`t trust me.

8
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,876
- What did he charge you?
- 7.98.

9
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,594
Wait until he runs out.
You know what to tell her?

10
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,516
- Got a second?
- Just a minute.

11
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:59,629
- Look what l`ve got. Carnival Gold.
- l`ve waited half an hour for this paint.

12
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:03,833
l`ll make you a deal.
l`ll make you a nice deal on this.

13
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:07,874
A dollar off.
1 0.98 on this special gold paint.

14
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,638
- How do you like that?
- Thank you.

15
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,913
- l`ll take a gallon of this.
- You got it. Let`s go!

16
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:19,956
That`s all right. Customers like that.
It gives them a sense of power.

17
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,312
- I need some brushes.
- How much painting do you plan to do?

18
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:27,478
After this I wouldn`t paint
my wife`s ass purple.

19
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,911
- What colour is it now?
- You ask me about my wife`s ass?!

20
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:36,956
- You brought it up.
- It has no colour, just stretch stripes.

21
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:41,915
- What about the brushes?
- The second display counter there.

22
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:51,556
- Mr Fusco, can I have an advance?
- Payday is Monday.

23
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:55,719
I know, but every place else
pays on Friday or Saturday.

24
00:04:55,920 --> 00:05:01,233
And they`re broke on Monday. Booze,
whores, pissing away their money.

25
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:06,036
This way you`ve got money all week.
You can save for the future.

26
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,836
- Fuck the future!
- No, Tony, you can`t fuck the future.

27
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:16,797
The future catches up with you, and it
fucks you if you haven`t planned for it.

28
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,551
Tonight is the future, and l`m planning
for it. There`s a shirt I have to buy...

29
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:24,718
Sorry, Tony. No exceptions.

30
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:30,028
Just wait until you need
an advance, bigshot!

31
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,192
Thanks, Tony!

32
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,879
Where have you been?

33
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:59,476
Your mother wants to know
where you`ve been.

34
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:05,150
- Where have you been?
- Your father asked where you`ve been.

35
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:09,148
Dinner will be late. Things had sold out
at the market. Normally you`d be late!

36
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,155
- Hey, Tony!
- Hot stuff, give me a kiss.

37
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,318
- Look what I made for you.
- That is beautiful.

38
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:19,876
- Like it? Will you put it in your room?
- Yeah, l`ll put it in my room right now.

39
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,713
- Dinner`s on the table.
- l`m not hungry.

40
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:39,517
Just because you`re kicking in for food,
doesn`t mean you don`t eat.

41
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,995
- l`ve got my shirt on.
- So?

42
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:46,432
- I don`t want to get anything on it.
- You don`t have to worry.

43
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:51,111
Your mother`s spaghetti sauce
doesn`t drip or taste.

44
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,996
Let`s go!

45
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,878
It`s always the same.

46
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:10,074
You say l`m late for dinner, but I work
until six and can`t make dinner in time.

47
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:14,796
You should`ve been a priest, like your
brother. You wouldn`t worry about a job.

48
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,274
Yeah.

49
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:22,396
- Must you always cross yourself?
- He`s a priest. Father Frank Junior.

50
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:25,876
She doesn`t have much to cross herself
about these days.

51
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:29,675
- You`re so jealous of Frank Junior.
- Shut up!

52
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:37,318
- Hey, watch the shirt, stupid!
- Basta! Mangia, mangia!

53
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:42,469
- Eat. l`ve got more pork chops.
- More pork chops? l`m out of work!

54
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:46,434
As long as we have a dollar,
we eat good. I might get a job.

55
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:51,919
Like hell! 25 years in construction
work. l`ve always had a paycheque.

56
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:57,592
For 6, 7 months l`m out of work,
and all of a sudden you hit me.

57
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:03,312
- And talk back. Talk of getting a job.
- OK, no hitting at the dinner table.

58
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:08,514
- You were the one who was hitting.
- You never hit me before. Never.

59
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:11,280
Not in front of the kids.

60
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:20,116
- One pork chop!
- Hey, Frank!

61
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,673
It`s disgusting.

62
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:25,478
Would you just watch the hair?

63
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:30,629
I work on my hair a long time,
and you hit it. He hits my hair.

64
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:36,156
Take care of his hair.
l`m going to take a walk.

65
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:44,349
- Will you walk me to church?
- Haven`t you been today?

66
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:48,189
- Confession. I must go back and pray.
- For what?

67
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:53,028
- For Father Frank Junior to call me.
- Why not call him?

68
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:58,872
- A son should call his mother.
- You`ll ask God to make Frank call you?

69
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:02,839
- Right.
- I don`t believe it.

70
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:06,636
You`re turning God
into a telephone operator.

71
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,160
You scumbags! Get back here.

72
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:31,510
- Assholes.
- Come on, fuckhead!

73
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:35,238
The stubborn fuck won`t budge!

74
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:54,634
- Put your hands on the wheel.
- I have!

75
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:59,311
- You almost broke my pussy finger.
- You wouldn`t know which one it was.

76
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:02,080
Have some. Tell them what we have.

77
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:07,115
We have ups, downs, three ludes,
two jays and half a bottle of vodka.

78
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:10,835
You get a bigger high from a fart!

79
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:14,828
- You want something?
- We`re not dropping until I say so.

80
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:18,749
- Why not?
- l`ve got my reasons.

81
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:21,633
- What`s wrong with you?
- Give me the vodka.

82
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:24,400
Get some new tapes. These are old.

83
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:28,832
I got them in the bargain basement.
If you don`t like them, l`ll get new ones.

84
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,832
Looking sharp, huh?

85
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:04,998
- Any sharper and you`d be a nigger.
- Or a spic.

86
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,590
Would you put your dick in a spic?
Does it get bigger in a nigger?

87
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:12,349
- I don`t know.
- l`ve got to score tonight. l`m horny!

88
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,710
Yeah, I know what you mean.

89
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:18,515
Anybody who scores
gets ten minutes in the car.

90
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:23,669
- Make five and you get the Pope`s ass!
- The Pope doesn`t have an ass.

91
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,313
Shape up. We`re the Faces.

92
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,670
Tony, how`s it going?

93
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,270
Hey, Mark!

94
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,638
Tony, have you seen Pauline here?

95
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:41,596
- No, we haven`t seen Pauline.
- Have you seen Pauline?

96
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:45,110
- What would you like?
- Give me a ``7 7``.

97
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:47,788
- A beer.
- A vodka and tonic.

98
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,195
Are you seeing the Knicks on Tuesday?

99
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,832
Tony.

100
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:13,314
- Yeah?
- What do you mean ``yeah``?

101
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:18,753
I mean, I can dance with you, but
you`re not my dream girl or anything.

102
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:25,117
You want a dream girl?
Then go to sleep and have a nightmare.

103
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:30,113
- Gus, here`s the speed.
- What are you doing? Take this.

104
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:33,312
Hello! This is Monty, your delicious DJ,

105
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:38,310
reminding you about the disco
sweepstakes. Get in line to get the prize!

106
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:11,997
What a trip! A good trip!
Feel the music, baby.

107
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,070
I want to dance with that chick.

108
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:24,555
- Which one?
- Just there.

109
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:29,115
Come on, Tony, dance!

110
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:07,192
It`s so beautiful, man. I like your new
haircut. I like that polyester look.

111
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:27,359
Tony, you`re the king out there.
You`re a great dancer.

112
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:31,439
- You`d be as good if you practised.
- Could I be a good dancer?

113
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:35,076
- Sure, why not? No.
- No?

114
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:38,989
- Won`t you ask me to sit down?
- No, you`d do it.

115
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:42,397
- But you`d ask me to lay down.
- No, you would not do it.

116
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:45,558
Double J, move over.
Meet my friend, here.

117
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:50,759
Tony, do you want some speed?
lt`s really good stuff.

118
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:56,796
- Can`t you guys get off on dancing?
- Tony, can I wipe off your forehead?

119
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,793
Why not? Go ahead.

120
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:04,351
It`s no blow job.

121
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:10,308
You don`t know fuck about women. You
get a blow job easier than you get that.

122
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:16,277
I love to watch you dance, Tony.
I love it. I love to watch you dance!

123
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:20,598
I just love it. Watching you dance.

124
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:23,553
Why don`t you take her for a dance?

125
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:27,435
That`s a good idea.
Would you like to dance?

126
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:33,072
Any dressing with the lace on the side.
Weirdest chick l`ve ever seen.

127
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:37,919
I love to. I love to watch you dance!

128
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:42,557
I just love it. Watching you dance.

129
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:48,318
Doreen, move up a little bit.
You look like you`re doing two-step.

130
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:51,557
Get your head out of his belt!

131
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:54,354
Oh, Jesus!

132
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:57,313
You can`t dance to this shit!

133
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:07,509
- Monty, why are you playing that shit?
- What?

134
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:11,349
Look at that chick.
She`s dancing, she`s moving.

135
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,316
Joe, you know that girl?

136
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:45,148
- No.
- Seen her before?

137
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,674
No.

138
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:50,835
Yeah, I saw her here
about a month ago.

139
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:58,191
She can dance.

140
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:02,188
She`s got the wrong partner,
but she can dance.

141
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,512
Ask her.

142
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:08,280
- Fuck you.
- Which position?

143
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:18,993
Who`s that guy?

144
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:34,034
- Hey, Teddy.
- Hey, Tony!

145
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,800
- How are you?
- OK, and you?

146
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,117
- Will you dance for me?
- Sure, why not?

147
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,673
- Hello, Lucille.
- Nureyev, how are you?

148
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:49,917
- Do you have a ``7 7``?
- Sure, doll.

149
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:52,634
Give me one of your butts, too.

150
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:01,118
- They`re having another sweepstakes.
- I know that.

151
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:04,357
It`s double the prize money, $500.

152
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:12,439
Are you going to enter?
You`ll need a partner.

153
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:22,869
- We won before.
- We`re going to have to practise.

154
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:29,238
- We`ll have to practise.
- People are coming from Manhattan.

155
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:33,797
- Revelation Gazebo, you know?
- We`ll have to practise.

156
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:39,438
Let`s practise, Annette. I don`t mean
dating or socialising. I mean practise.

157
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:46,269
- Why not? We had a date.
- Yeah, once. And once was enough.

158
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,639
- Why?
- Why?

159
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:54,630
You only talked about your married
sister. And your other married sister.

160
00:20:54,840 --> 00:21:01,712
And your third married sister. I felt that
you just wanted to be a married sister.

161
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:04,593
Look, I told you l`d take care of it.

162
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:08,873
Double J has been in the car
25 minutes with some chick.

163
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:11,878
I can`t get the selfish prick out.

164
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:15,038
These guys can`t do nothing
without me.

165
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:32,868
- You gonna make it with Annette?
- I don`t think so.

166
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:37,437
If you make it with some chicks,
they think you`ll dance with them.

167
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:40,916
Get out! You`ve been in there
20 minutes.

168
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:46,069
- 25 in the car, 20 in the chick.
- Get out before we pull you out.

169
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:49,716
- She hasn`t come.
- Since when did you care?

170
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,356
Come on!

171
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,998
OK, it`s happening.

172
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:02,637
It`s happening, it`s happening!
l`ll be out in a minute.

173
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:06,437
Harder! l`m coming, l`m coming!

174
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:17,874
What was your name?

175
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,956
Kiss me.

176
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:44,116
Kiss me!

177
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:49,833
I just kissed Al Pacino!

178
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:23,748
I don`t look like Al Pacino.

179
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:29,635
I could look like him. Al Pacino.

180
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:32,640
Yeah. Al Pacino.

181
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,156
Al Pacino!

182
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,749
Attica, Attica!

183
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:43,748
- Attica, Attica, Attica!
- Give me the ball!

184
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:50,029
- Wanna see the Bruce Lee picture?
- He`s dead, so I don`t give a damn.

185
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,674
Have you no respect for the guy?

186
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:57,633
- See what the Knicks pay Frazier?
- We`ll never make that much money.

187
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:01,435
- Hey, douche, douche!
- It`s all right.

188
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:05,599
- Why don`t you kill fags on Sunday?
- `Cause then they`ll go to heaven.

189
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:09,918
Hey, sweetheart! You`re terrific!

190
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:12,111
Hey, double dirty!

191
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:16,279
- This is a drag.
- What`s with you today?

192
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:19,870
- l`m not sure l`ll do 2001 tonight.
- Fucking do it!

193
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:23,959
Do you have 20-30 bucks
to blow twice a week?

194
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,991
Come on, Tony!

195
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:32,036
- l`m going to get one of these.
- You`ll never have that kind of money.

196
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:37,189
- That`s your favourite speech!
- We`ll never have that much money.

197
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:41,075
Get it together before it`s all over.
A Caddy Seville.

198
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:43,840
My uncle has one, plus a Mercedes.

199
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:47,396
He got them by forcing
his partner to sell out.

200
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:50,637
- It`s a dog-eat-dog world.
- It`s true.

201
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:55,710
They have it all locked up.
Nobody will give you a chance.

202
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:59,833
- Nobody gives you nothing.
- It`s every man for himself.

203
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:02,429
It`s a stinking rat race.

204
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:08,989
- Best vinyl l`ve ever seen at that price!
- I told you. You just listen to me.

205
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:14,399
You saved me a bit of change. If you
ever want to be a painter, let me know.

206
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:18,434
You make twice as much as here.
Are you interested?

207
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,119
I don`t know.

208
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:23,949
You make twice as much,
but break your back!

209
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:27,197
- No advances, nothing...
- I gave you a raise.

210
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:29,356
- What?
- A raise.

211
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:32,950
- Are you kidding?
- Come on, see how much it is.

212
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:36,789
- Thank you. I can`t believe this.
- You better look.

213
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,993
- It doesn`t matter. You gave me a raise.
- It`s only 2.50.

214
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:44,590
- So what?
- $2.50 ain`t much.

215
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:51,638
- The important thing is that it`s a raise.
- l`ll give you 3.50 next week. A dollar...

216
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:56,391
Shut up, will you? Four.
l`ll make it an even four.

217
00:27:56,600 --> 00:28:00,229
Never seen anybody so happy
over a crummy 2.50 raise!

218
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:04,035
Two? You just said $4, didn`t you?

219
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:11,478
- What the hell are you doing?
- I feel like it.

220
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:15,116
- Girls do that.
- I got a raise today.

221
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:21,031
Why didn`t you say that during dinner?
Put them down. How much did you get?

222
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:23,595
It will be $4.00.

223
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:29,033
It was 2.50, but he raised the raise
when he saw I wasn`t disappointed.

224
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:30,514
$4.00?

225
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:35,999
Shit! Do you know what $4.00 buys
today? Not even $3.00!

226
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:41,149
- Has Unemployment given you a raise?
- $4.00? Shit!

227
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:46,559
I knew you`d piss on it. Go on, piss
on it! A raise means that you`re good.

228
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:50,912
How many times has somebody
told me I was good? Two times.

229
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:53,953
This raise and dancing at the disco.

230
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:57,550
You sure as fuck never did. Asshole!

231
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:00,556
$4.00. Shit!

232
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:25,720
- Why aren`t you waiting inside?
- I wanted to watch you walk.

233
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:27,512
Shit.

234
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:32,316
Tony, listen...l`ve been thinking.

235
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:37,469
- Maybe l`ll make it with you.
- You call that thinking? Jesus Christ!

236
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:40,356
You`re too much, Annette.

237
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:45,076
If you say we`re going to make it,
then we`ll make it? So I have no say?

238
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:48,078
It`s time we went out. You wanted to.

239
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:54,674
You told me how horny a man gets
at 1 9. His balls ache if he doesn`t get it.

240
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:57,030
How do you remember those things?

241
00:29:57,240 --> 00:30:01,552
We`re gonna be spending
a lot of time together practising.

242
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:06,880
If we were balling, we`d be going
together. I don`t want to go with you.

243
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:11,596
- Are you a nice girl or a cunt?
- I don`t know. Both?

244
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:17,318
You can`t be both. A girl has to decide
early on what she`s going to be.

245
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:19,670
- Hi, Pete.
- Tony, my man!

246
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:22,314
- Do you have a free studio?
- Two.

247
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:27,275
- How are you doing?

248
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:30,438
Pete! He`s always busting my onions.

249
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:34,997
- I send customers and get free studio...

250
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:39,356
That means that he...

251
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:43,314
that come in here.

252
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:50,435
One-two-three, two-two-three.

253
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:54,030
One-two, one-two-three, one-two-three.
Good!

254
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:59,078
Good. That`s it. Do it again.

255
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:12,428
- That`s it. Good. Again.
- Tony, it`s only dancing!

256
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:16,997
If you`re not going to take this seriously,
I don`t want to dance.

257
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:19,555
- Don`t get mad.
- Don`t get mad?

258
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:26,197
I think we`ve done enough dancing
for today.

259
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:29,676
- So let`s dance on Wednesday?
- Yeah, sure.

260
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:36,711
- Are you going home now?
- No, l`m going to talk to Peter.

261
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:39,559
And work on some stuff myself.

262
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:43,719
See you later. You were good today.

263
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:12,433
Hi. How are you doing?

264
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:18,516
You`re a very good dancer,
you know that?

265
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:23,074
I would like to meet you.

266
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:27,789
- Would you mind just going away?
- What?

267
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:32,437
Don`t be hurt. I want to be by myself,
you know?

268
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,878
- I saw you at 2001 .
- So?

269
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:38,753
You looked at me and I looked at you.

270
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:43,909
I look at a guy for a millionth of a second
and he gets delusions of grandeur!

271
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:49,148
- l`m going to tell you what you are.
- I bet it begins with a ``C``, Mr P.

272
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:52,397
Fine, fine. That`s...

273
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:55,797
I know the type. Fine.

274
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:09,590
Why are you up so late? What is this?
Don`t you have any criticism of me?

275
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:14,036
- Your brother`s upstairs.
- You`re kidding!

276
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:18,631
- Frankie! How are you doing?
- How are you, kid?

277
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:23,557
- It`s good to see you.
- You, too.

278
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:27,514
- You look good.
- No, I don`t. You look wonderful.

279
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:32,794
- Checking out my trophy?
- That`s you? First prize.

280
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:36,436
- Looks just like you.
- What did you say to them?

281
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:39,950
They look like zombies,
like somebody died!

282
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:45,518
- I think they`re in shock, Tony.
- Why would they be in shock?

283
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:51,670
- l`m leaving the Church.
- Yeah, sure. Leaving the Church.

284
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:56,513
- Tell me another one.
- l`m leaving the priesthood.

285
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:59,439
Frank, don`t fool around like that.

286
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:04,589
Do you think l`m losing my hair?
It looks very thin right here and here.

287
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:08,236
Are you serious?

288
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:13,389
Can I borrow your clothes until I buy
some? I don`t want to wear the uniform.

289
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:18,910
- l`m really sorry, Frank.
- What are you sorry about?

290
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:23,193
- You got fired, right?
- No, I quit.

291
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:27,359
- You quit?
- Yeah, you can, you know?

292
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:39,031
Well, what did Mom say about it?

293
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:43,552
``Dear Lord, what am I going to tell
Theresa and Marie?``

294
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:48,914
- What did Dad say?
- They`re ashamed. Both of them.

295
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:53,513
Are you ashamed of me, Tony?

296
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:56,078
Yeah.

297
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:59,878
- Didn`t they ask why?
- No.

298
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:04,835
I think they`re afraid to.
Like I might say, ``Celibacy``.

299
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:08,952
But...

300
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:18,277
Are you going to sleep here tonight?
In my room?

301
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:23,998
- Yeah, I thought I would.
- All right, l`ll get blankets for you.

302
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:45,670
Frank, how come you left, really?

303
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:52,319
It`s not easy to explain, Anthony.
A lot of things.

304
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:59,279
One day you look at a crucifix, and
all you see is a man dying on a cross.

305
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:03,996
But that`s only a backdrop
to something else.

306
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:08,473
Mama and Papa,
their dreams of pious glory.

307
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:13,113
They turn you into what they wish
at the time.

308
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:16,835
You can`t defend yourself
against their fantasies.

309
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:22,910
All I ever really had any belief in
was their image of me as a priest, so...

310
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:35,353
I guess we`ll have to take your picture
down from the mantle.

311
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:44,799
You know what`s weird? I always felt
I was the shit and you were perfect.

312
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:49,710
Now that l`m the disgrace to the family,
l`m not so perfect any more.

313
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:52,878
So maybe you`re not shit any more.

314
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:58,878
Yeah, maybe if you`re not so good,
then l`m not so bad.

315
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:00,718
Yeah.

316
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:13,719
- Give me the groceries.
- Don`t take my groceries. Come on!

317
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:17,993
- Don`t eat the apple. Give it back.
- Here.

318
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:22,352
Jesus! What`s the matter with you?
What are you doing?

319
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:25,154
My brother quit the Church.

320
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:28,796
I feel wild. l`ve got all this energy!

321
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:32,913
l`ll call you tonight, all right?
See you later, Gus!

322
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:39,275
Higher with the arms! Yeah, that`s it.

323
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:42,268
Yeah, do it to me!

324
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:47,711
- She come in?
- I told you she comes in on Tuesday.

325
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:50,639
- So is she here?
- What is today?

326
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:53,479
- It`s Tuesday.
- Yeah.

327
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:59,553
Hey, Tone! Watch it. That one`s
practising to be a bitch. Come on!

328
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:40,672
Hello, Stephanie Mangano.
l`m Tony Manero.

329
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:43,758
We both have the same last initial.

330
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:48,909
When we get married I don`t have to
change the monogram on my luggage.

331
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:54,069
Somebody said you`re practising
to be a bitch. Is that true?

332
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:03,837
- What do you want to ask me?
- Will you have coffee with me?

333
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:07,396
- Is that it?
- I think you`re a very good dancer.

334
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:12,993
You know that 2001 Odyssey
has a dance contest now?

335
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:17,270
I think that we could be
a dynamite team together.

336
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:22,511
- How old are you?
- l`m 20.

337
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:28,679
l`m 1 9 at the moment,
but l`ll be 20 very shortly.

338
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:32,236
I think there`s a world of difference
between us.

339
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:37,560
Not just chronologically, but emotionally,
culturally, physically, every way,

340
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:42,436
and this world would get bigger
and worse with every passing week.

341
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:46,838
- What shit is that? Coffee, not sex.
- Just coffee?

342
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:51,875
I work with very remarkable people.
They`re not like Bay Ridge people.

343
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:54,878
- Snobs instead of slobs?
- What?

344
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:59,039
Nothing. Bay Ridge isn`t the worst part
of Brooklyn.

345
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:03,199
- It`s no hellhole.
- Well, it ain`t...isn`t Manhattan.

346
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:08,713
Right over there, across the river,
everything is completely different.

347
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:13,198
It`s beautiful! People are beautiful,
offices are beautiful.

348
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:16,836
The secretaries all shop
at Bonwit Teller.

349
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:19,508
The lunch hours are beautiful, too.

350
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:24,316
They`ll give you two hours for lunch
to do something related.

351
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:26,909
We saw Zeffirelli`s ``Romeo and Juliet``.

352
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:30,715
``Romeo and Juliet``?
I read that in high school.

353
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:33,559
That`s Shakespeare, right?

354
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:39,357
No, it`s Zeffirelli, the director
of the movie. You know, the movie?

355
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:44,315
What I never understood
about ``Romeo and Juliet``

356
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:47,398
is why Romeo took
the poison so quick.

357
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:49,909
I feel like he could have waited.

358
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:53,078
It`s the way they took poison
in those days.

359
00:40:54,720 --> 00:41:00,078
- Are you eating? Here`s the menu.
- No, l`ll just have tea with lemon.

360
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:04,116
l`ve started drinking tea.
It`s more refined.

361
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:05,878
Oh, yeah?

362
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:11,598
All the women executives drink tea
with lemon. They notice that I do, too.

363
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:16,029
- I like coffee. I drink coffee.
- Yeah.

364
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:22,435
l`ve only been with this agency
a short time,

365
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:27,077
but over there l`m functioning
in a kind of public relations capacity.

366
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:29,589
I fill in for the agents.

367
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:34,954
This week I had business lunches
with Eric Clapton at the Cóte Basque.

368
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:38,994
- And Cat Stevens at Le Madrigal.
- Far out!

369
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:41,270
You heard of those restaurants?

370
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:46,315
No, I don`t know those exact
restaurants, but I know the type.

371
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:52,709
- But you must have heard of the artists.
- No, I don`t know... Not really.

372
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:57,878
- Why did you say, ``Far out``?
- It sounded like far out. Wasn`t it?

373
00:41:58,080 --> 00:42:01,038
- Yeah.
- We`d like a lemon with some tea.

374
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:04,994
l`d like a cheeseburger
and some coffee.

375
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:14,279
Know who came in the office?
Laurence Olivier.

376
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:17,711
- Who`s that?
- You don`t know who he is?

377
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:24,471
Laurence Olivier is the greatest actor
in the world! You know who he is.

378
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:29,993
He`s the English actor on television,
who does those Polaroid commercials.

379
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:33,518
Oh, him! He`s good. He is good.

380
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:36,678
I did a few errands for him.

381
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:39,189
He tells everyone in the office

382
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:45,191
that l`m the brightest, the most
vivacious thing in the entire office!

383
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:49,075
Could you get a camera from him
at a discount?

384
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:54,832
- I didn`t ask him about a camera!
- `Cause you have one, you sly fox.

385
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:57,998
- Are you enjoying what l`m telling you?
- Sure.

386
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:03,149
Maybe you can`t handle hearing about
a kind of life so different from yours.

387
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:07,035
- You mean better?
- Yes, sure, it`s better.

388
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:08,514
Ketchup, please.

389
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:11,234
l`m out of this Bay Ridge scene.

390
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:14,671
l`m getting my own apartment
in Manhattan.

391
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:21,149
l`m changing as a person. l`m growing.
Nobody knows how much l`m growing.

392
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:24,318
Why don`t you go on a diet?

393
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:30,432
Listen. I like you.

394
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:35,998
We could dance together, nothing more.
I don`t want you coming on to me.

395
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:39,476
- Why not?
- I don`t dig guys like you any more.

396
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:44,674
You`re too young, have no class,
and you don`t have your shit together.

397
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:50,876
It`s easy to get your shit together.
Take a salad bowl and potato masher.

398
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:54,356
Get your shit together.
Shall I tell you what I do?

399
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:57,120
- It`s not necessary.
- l`ll tell you.

400
00:43:57,320 --> 00:44:00,278
I work in a paint store, and I got a raise.

401
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:03,517
Right, and you probably
live with your family,

402
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:08,271
hang out with your buddies, and
Saturday nights you blow it all at 2001 .

403
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:12,712
You`re a cliché. You`re nowhere,
on your way to no place.

404
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:19,994
- Do you have a stairway to the stars?
- Maybe.

405
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:23,317
l`m taking a course,
and next semester l`ll take two.

406
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:26,159
- You didn`t go to college, did you?
- No.

407
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:30,194
- Did you ever think of going to college?
- No, did you?

408
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:33,198
- Not back then...
- Then why bug me about it?

409
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:36,949
Why didn`t you want to go to college?
Tell me.

410
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:39,515
Jesus Christ! I didn`t!

411
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:50,156
The high I get at 2001 is just dancing.
It`s not being a bastard or anything.

412
00:44:50,360 --> 00:44:55,878
But l`d like to get that high
someplace else in my life, you know?

413
00:44:56,080 --> 00:45:00,710
- Like where?
- I don`t know where. Someplace.

414
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:05,948
Dancing can`t last forever.
It`s a short-lived kind of thing.

415
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:08,720
But l`m getting older, you know?

416
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:16,270
But so what? Does that mean I can`t
feel that way about anything else in life?

417
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:20,189
- Is that it?
- We have to split here.

418
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:25,918
- No, l`ll walk you the rest of the way.
- No, l`ll meet you at the dance studio.

419
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:30,591
- Stephanie, I can walk you home.
- Nothing personal, right?

420
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:33,758
Come on, Stephanie! I can walk you.

421
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:38,750
Jesus Christ! You know...

422
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:49,511
- Where is he? Did you call him?
- No.

423
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:57,672
- What`s the matter?
- Gus is in hospital. The spics got him.

424
00:45:57,880 --> 00:45:59,518
- Barons?
- Barracudas.

425
00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:03,554
- That`s my fucking car!
- Give me the keys.

426
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:06,558
- You`re asking for it.
- I just saw him!

427
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:11,629
- He could have run, but that`s Gus.
- Don`t worry about it.

428
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:17,597
I visited him. He has a broken nose,
ribs, leg and four teeth knocked out.

429
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:21,918
He was carrying his groceries
and three of them jumped him.

430
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:24,350
They spilled his groceries.

431
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:29,190
So he said, under his breath, ``Grease-
balls, spic-dicks,`` and they got him.

432
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:42,754
Check it out.

433
00:46:59,560 --> 00:47:01,391
Nobody in there.

434
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:10,229
We`re going to cruise around until
there`s enough of them we can handle.

435
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:13,716
- We`ll pick off a couple on the street.
- That`s pussy!

436
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:18,436
- You`re fucked up!
- l`m sorry, l`m sorry, l`m sorry.

437
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:21,473
l`m sorry, l`m sorry.

438
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:24,638
Forget it, we`ll get them tomorrow.

439
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:30,558
Dream good, jerk off better.

440
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:36,953
- Tony, l`m getting married.
- Will you cut that shit.

441
00:47:37,160 --> 00:47:39,720
I just wanted to let you know.

442
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:45,040
If you get married, we`ll all go with you
on your honeymoon, all right?

443
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:48,312
- Take it easy.
- Bobby, get in the car!

444
00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:54,789
We should go to the hospital tomorrow,
you know?

445
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,639
You cool off. You know?

446
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:01,154
All right. Goodnight.

447
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:25,791
- What did you say to Father Frank?
- What?

448
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,434
- What did you say?
- Yeah?

449
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:32,269
- What do you mean?
- You must have said something.

450
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:36,075
You sleep in the same room,
and then he stays out all night.

451
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:39,272
- l`ve said nothing.
- A priest staying out all night.

452
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:42,711
He`s not a priest now,
so he can do what he wants.

453
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:46,879
- You said something!
- Are you trying to blame me?

454
00:48:47,080 --> 00:48:52,837
- You`ve been writing to him.
- You`re trying to hang this on me!

455
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:55,634
He called, he called.

456
00:48:55,840 --> 00:48:58,638
In time, he`ll see he`s wrong.

457
00:48:58,840 --> 00:49:03,391
He`s going through a trial of the soul.
He`s going back to the Church.

458
00:49:03,600 --> 00:49:06,990
- No, he won`t...
- Yes, he`s going back to the Church!

459
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:11,910
- He`s going back!
- No! You don`t have a priest any more.

460
00:49:12,120 --> 00:49:16,716
You`ve got nothing but three
shit children now! Good, good.

461
00:49:26,080 --> 00:49:28,435
l`m sorry, Mom.

462
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:35,196
I didn`t mean that. l`m sorry.

463
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:40,349
- I love you, Mom. I really do.
- Go away. Get out of here.

464
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:55,479
- How are you?
- OK.

465
00:49:55,680 --> 00:49:59,878
Look, Annette,
I have to tell you something.

466
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:03,072
It`s very hard to tell you this, but...

467
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:08,229
...I changed my mind about us dancing
together. I have another partner.

468
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:16,354
It`s professional. Things like this happen
when it`s professional.

469
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:20,358
Jesus Christ. First my mother, now you.

470
00:50:21,120 --> 00:50:25,830
Why do you hate me so much?
All I ever did was like you.

471
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:28,395
Give me a break.

472
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:45,352
- Hi.
- You`re late.

473
00:50:45,560 --> 00:50:49,189
Only five minutes.
How long have you been here?

474
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:53,712
- Six, seven minutes.
- Pete said you`d been here 1 5.

475
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:55,876
Who`s he?

476
00:50:56,080 --> 00:51:01,200
l`ve got some records. I don`t know
if you like them. You like these guys?

477
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:03,391
Yeah, super.

478
00:51:03,840 --> 00:51:06,877
You do the New York Hustle
or the Latin Hustle?

479
00:51:07,080 --> 00:51:10,038
New York, Latin, I do it all.

480
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:39,076
Follow me this time.

481
00:51:48,560 --> 00:51:55,432
- That`s nice. Did you make that up?
- I saw it on TV first, then I made it up.

482
00:51:55,760 --> 00:52:00,834
- I learned one. What I do...
- Wait, let me check something out.

483
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:17,996
- Come on.
- What are you doing?

484
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:26,355
Stay right there.

485
00:52:35,240 --> 00:52:40,155
- Now we can dance!
- Let me show you the Latin step.

486
00:52:40,360 --> 00:52:42,749
Take your hand like this and count.

487
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:45,315
One-two-three, two-two-three.

488
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:48,478
Three-two-three, kick-two-three.

489
00:52:49,160 --> 00:52:51,515
l`ve got it. It`s good.

490
00:52:58,320 --> 00:52:59,639
I like that.

491
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:02,513
- Do you know the Tango Hustle?
- Yeah.

492
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:04,711
Let`s try that.

493
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:18,438
- Would you like some coffee?
- No, I gotta go home.

494
00:54:22,280 --> 00:54:25,238
I like you when you`re like this.

495
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:29,399
When you`re quiet
and not laying all that shit on me.

496
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:33,709
Guess who I had lunch with today?
Paul Anka.

497
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:38,357
- I had to open my big mouth.
- It was interesting. Very interesting.

498
00:54:38,560 --> 00:54:42,519
- A very intelligent fellow.
- You cream over that word interesting.

499
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:48,238
- What`s wrong with interesting?
- Something. Let me tell you something.

500
00:54:48,440 --> 00:54:51,273
- I think you`re full of shit.
- Oh, you do?

501
00:54:51,480 --> 00:54:54,631
But I don`t know how much is shit
and how much is bullshit.

502
00:54:54,840 --> 00:54:58,799
When you figure it out,
let me know, all right?

503
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:05,270
We should practise a couple of more
times. Maybe go to 2001 with a crowd.

504
00:55:05,480 --> 00:55:08,074
- Would Saturday be good?
- Maybe.

505
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:13,115
Stephanie, I want to ask you something.

506
00:55:13,320 --> 00:55:16,278
I don`t know how to say this.

507
00:55:18,280 --> 00:55:22,239
Do you think that I am
either interesting or intelligent?

508
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:25,830
Interesting, yeah.

509
00:55:26,040 --> 00:55:28,600
Intelligent?

510
00:55:29,720 --> 00:55:32,359
I don`t know. Maybe.

511
00:55:32,560 --> 00:55:37,429
l`ve got to know you better. You`ve got
a way of seeing things a certain way.

512
00:55:37,640 --> 00:55:39,915
Interesting, yeah.

513
00:55:40,120 --> 00:55:43,510
Intelligent? Yeah, maybe.
Maybe intelligent.

514
00:55:43,720 --> 00:55:48,157
Well, what do you know? All right!

515
00:55:48,360 --> 00:55:53,718
Stephanie, why don`t we talk about
how we feel when we`re dancing?

516
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:58,471
- Goodnight and thanks.
- Could I walk you the rest of the way?

517
00:55:58,680 --> 00:56:00,636
No.

518
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:05,749
You shouldn`t have asked,
you should have just done it!

519
00:56:05,960 --> 00:56:06,437
Hot stuff. Jesus!

520
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:52,839
- What`s happening?
- This is my brother Frank.

521
00:57:05,720 --> 00:57:08,314
Our table is over there.

522
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:29,437
You guys have a Moses effect!
The crowd parts like the Red Sea.

523
00:57:29,640 --> 00:57:32,598
- They know the Faces.
- Do you like it, Father?

524
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:37,749
Do I look like your father? Please don`t
call me that. I never could stand that.

525
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:42,238
But, yeah, I think the place
is energising!

526
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:54,472
Hey, Tony.

527
00:57:54,680 --> 00:57:56,716
- Hey.
- Hey.

528
00:57:56,920 --> 00:57:59,878
Are you as good in bed
as on the dance floor?

529
00:58:02,040 --> 00:58:06,477
Are you? Are you as good in bed
as you are on the dance floor?

530
00:58:06,680 --> 00:58:09,240
He never made it in a bed.

531
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:13,399
Watch this. This isn`t
my regular partner, but you`ll see.

532
00:58:15,720 --> 00:58:19,679
- What are you going to have to drink?
- ``7 7``.

533
00:58:19,880 --> 00:58:22,269
Where is she?

534
00:58:36,560 --> 00:58:39,870
So, when is Connie going to get
her answer?

535
00:58:40,520 --> 00:58:42,590
- You know, Connie?
- Yeah?

536
00:58:42,800 --> 00:58:47,749
If you`re as good in bed as you are on
the dance floor, you`re one lousy fuck.

537
00:58:47,960 --> 00:58:51,191
Why do they always send flowers
the next day?

538
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:57,999
Some guys don`t know a lousy fuck.
Or maybe they thought you were dead!

539
00:58:58,200 --> 00:59:00,350
Father, listen.

540
00:59:00,560 --> 00:59:06,908
My girlfriend is such a good Catholic,
she says she loves Communion wafers.

541
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:12,316
- Mr Manero, can I talk to you?
- What`s he doing?

542
00:59:15,080 --> 00:59:17,514
Forget this!

543
00:59:17,720 --> 00:59:21,554
Give the kid some room.
He`s taking over again!

544
01:01:33,160 --> 01:01:37,119
- He`s very good.
- He`s the king out there, Father.

545
01:01:37,320 --> 01:01:40,312
- He`s the best.
- He`s great, he`s great.

546
01:01:47,560 --> 01:01:51,075
- Can I talk to you, Father?
- Call me Frank.

547
01:01:51,280 --> 01:01:56,638
Frank, listen. Do you want
to hear something? My girlfriend...

548
01:01:56,840 --> 01:02:00,196
Can I tell you something?
Come here for a second.

549
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:04,359
I have a lot of ideas. I was reading
about the Pope. Father!

550
01:02:04,560 --> 01:02:07,393
- Frank.
- Frank. Yeah, Frank.

551
01:02:07,600 --> 01:02:13,835
Listen, Frank. I have a girlfriend.
Her name is Pauline, and I...

552
01:02:14,040 --> 01:02:19,876
- What? Did you get her pregnant?
- Yes, I did. Yes, I did.

553
01:02:20,680 --> 01:02:23,399
She loves Communion wafers.

554
01:02:23,600 --> 01:02:28,390
I have ideas swimming around in my
head. l`ve been reading a lot of stuff.

555
01:02:28,600 --> 01:02:33,469
- I heard the Pope can give a special...
- ...dispensation.

556
01:02:33,680 --> 01:02:37,673
Do you think the Pope
could give Pauline an abortion?

557
01:02:37,880 --> 01:02:43,113
- A dispensation for an abortion?
- Yeah, do you think he could?

558
01:02:43,320 --> 01:02:47,233
- I don`t think so, Bobby.
- Maybe he could for me.

559
01:02:47,440 --> 01:02:50,557
- Maybe?
- Sorry, Bobby. I don`t think so.

560
01:02:50,760 --> 01:02:53,433
Have you talked to your priest about it?

561
01:02:53,640 --> 01:02:58,668
Yeah, l`ve talked to everybody about it.
I mean, l`ve talked to a lot of people.

562
01:02:58,880 --> 01:03:04,671
Thank you! Thanks a lot. You play,
you pay, you know? lt`s funny, right?

563
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:09,995
Don`t forget, everybody.
You could win, too, man!

564
01:03:11,600 --> 01:03:14,160
Disco Universe Sweepstakes
are just a week away.

565
01:03:14,560 --> 01:03:17,518
- Do you know Stephanie Mangano?
- No.

566
01:03:17,720 --> 01:03:20,359
- I do.
- Has she come in?

567
01:03:20,560 --> 01:03:23,518
- No, not yet.
- Are you sure?

568
01:03:31,160 --> 01:03:34,118
- Tony! That was great.
- You liked it?

569
01:03:34,320 --> 01:03:36,993
- l`m going home now.
- Home?

570
01:03:37,200 --> 01:03:40,431
Stay longer.
The night`s just beginning.

571
01:03:40,640 --> 01:03:45,316
It`s not my scene.
You didn`t expect me to stay all night?

572
01:03:45,520 --> 01:03:50,389
No, I didn`t. Yes, I thought
that maybe you`d stay a little...

573
01:03:50,600 --> 01:03:53,114
- No, it`s not your scene.
- l`m sorry.

574
01:03:53,320 --> 01:03:58,713
Don`t worry about it. It`s nothing.
Come on, l`ll walk you to the door.

575
01:03:58,920 --> 01:04:03,994
You know, your dancing
is really marvellous. It`s exciting!

576
01:04:04,200 --> 01:04:08,910
It`s exciting to watch you.
They can`t keep their eyes off you.

577
01:04:09,120 --> 01:04:13,671
- I have to go now.
- Have a good night. l`ll see you later.

578
01:04:13,880 --> 01:04:18,829
- Has she come in?
- You just asked me. She isn`t here.

579
01:04:26,080 --> 01:04:30,870
- Is your brother OK?
- He`s fine. He just had a stomach thing.

580
01:04:42,240 --> 01:04:44,310
Let`s move.

581
01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:53,428
We could make it now. We aren`t
practising, so we could make it.

582
01:04:53,640 --> 01:04:58,270
We make it when I decide, all right?
When I say so.

583
01:04:58,480 --> 01:05:02,439
- l`ll just make it with somebody else.
- Who?

584
01:05:02,640 --> 01:05:07,077
- Somebody! Anybody here.
- Somebody here?

585
01:05:07,280 --> 01:05:10,431
- Double J, Joey...
- The fuck you will!

586
01:05:10,640 --> 01:05:16,590
Bobby, we`re going to the car.
When I get back, we`ll go to the bridge.

587
01:05:19,720 --> 01:05:22,109
Are you fixed?

588
01:05:23,640 --> 01:05:26,598
- Are you fixed?
- What do you mean?

589
01:05:26,800 --> 01:05:30,110
- Are you on the Pill, or what?
- No.

590
01:05:30,320 --> 01:05:31,992
No?

591
01:05:32,760 --> 01:05:37,038
- What have you got? The IOU thing?
- No.

592
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:41,915
- No diaphragm? Nothing?
- It doesn`t matter.

593
01:05:42,120 --> 01:05:44,395
- Nothing?
- Tony, I love you.

594
01:05:44,600 --> 01:05:47,239
Are you kidding? Forget it.

595
01:05:47,440 --> 01:05:50,637
Fuck! Just give me a blow job.
Come on.

596
01:05:54,440 --> 01:05:56,396
- Just a minute.
- Hey, Tony!

597
01:05:56,600 --> 01:06:02,516
Forget it. Fix yourself up. Everything
was cool, you had a good time.

598
01:06:15,440 --> 01:06:18,034
Annette, cigarette?

599
01:06:19,800 --> 01:06:20,630
Guess not.

600
01:06:58,360 --> 01:06:59,873
Stupid screw-offs!

601
01:07:13,520 --> 01:07:17,718
Annette, can you dig it?
I knew that you could.

602
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:28,388
- Joey!
- Fuck, Double J!

603
01:07:29,160 --> 01:07:35,315
Tony! Let`s get the motherfuck down!
Let`s push him off!

604
01:07:35,520 --> 01:07:39,832
- You`re going in, you big fucking hunk!
- `sto cazzo, man!

605
01:07:40,680 --> 01:07:43,399
Come on, Tony! Let`s get him!

606
01:07:45,160 --> 01:07:47,230
Come on, let`s go.

607
01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:51,035
- Honky!
- Let`s get the motherfuck off!

608
01:07:51,240 --> 01:07:53,231
Hey! Tarzan!

609
01:07:59,720 --> 01:08:01,233
Double J!

610
01:08:02,720 --> 01:08:04,711
Don`t look! l`m coming!

611
01:08:10,080 --> 01:08:11,433
You fuckers!

612
01:08:11,640 --> 01:08:15,428
- Can you dig it?
- I knew that you could!

613
01:08:17,600 --> 01:08:19,955
You stupid bitch.

614
01:08:30,600 --> 01:08:33,114
I wish you were staying longer.

615
01:08:33,320 --> 01:08:37,916
Ex-priests don`t stay back home.
Everyone`s too disgraced.

616
01:08:38,120 --> 01:08:43,069
When a family raises a priest, they think
they`ve scored points in heaven.

617
01:08:43,280 --> 01:08:47,478
We`d better get going. I have
to pick up some people on the way.

618
01:08:47,680 --> 01:08:52,231
- We have to keep in touch.
- Will you like this settlement house?

619
01:08:52,440 --> 01:08:54,635
It`ll do until I figure out my next move.

620
01:08:54,840 --> 01:08:56,717
- And you?
- What?

621
01:08:56,920 --> 01:09:02,233
- What will you do about the dancing?
- People ask me all the time.

622
01:09:02,440 --> 01:09:06,672
All my life l`ve been told
l`m the no-good in the family.

623
01:09:06,880 --> 01:09:11,271
The only way you`ll survive is
to do what you think is right.

624
01:09:11,480 --> 01:09:17,430
Not what they try to jam you into.
If you do that, you`ll end up miserable.

625
01:09:23,720 --> 01:09:26,393
Have a good trip.

626
01:09:27,840 --> 01:09:31,230
- I left you something in your room.
- What?

627
01:09:31,440 --> 01:09:34,796
- A souvenir.
- Money?

628
01:09:36,600 --> 01:09:38,556
Leave money!

629
01:10:14,600 --> 01:10:20,152
- Hi! Why are you standing there?
- Why didn`t you come on Saturday?

630
01:10:20,360 --> 01:10:23,511
- I didn`t say I would come.
- The fuck you did.

631
01:10:23,720 --> 01:10:28,271
I said maybe.
I didn`t think you`d get upset about it.

632
01:10:28,480 --> 01:10:33,190
l`m not upset, but we needed
the practice. You should`ve been there.

633
01:10:33,400 --> 01:10:35,789
Let`s practise, then.

634
01:10:37,920 --> 01:10:41,595
I didn`t bring records.
I didn`t think you`d be here.

635
01:10:41,800 --> 01:10:44,758
So why did you come?

636
01:10:47,440 --> 01:10:51,797
- `sto cazzo. Do you know `sto cazzo?
- Yeah, I know `sto cazzo.

637
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:53,274
We`ll use this.

638
01:10:53,480 --> 01:10:56,358
``lf you`re not of your mind
to break up...``

639
01:10:57,400 --> 01:11:00,358
- What`s up?
- We`ve been waiting, man.

640
01:11:00,560 --> 01:11:05,156
- Pete said you were practising.
- We`ve been cruising you-know-who.

641
01:11:05,360 --> 01:11:07,999
We`ll talk about it later.

642
01:11:08,200 --> 01:11:11,556
Stephanie, this is Joey,
Double J and Bobby C.

643
01:11:11,760 --> 01:11:15,514
- How are you? Are you a dancer?
- Yeah.

644
01:11:15,720 --> 01:11:17,278
- Hungry?
- Yeah.

645
01:11:17,480 --> 01:11:19,914
Where do you want to eat?

646
01:11:21,400 --> 01:11:23,914
l`m going to change, and then...

647
01:11:24,840 --> 01:11:27,877
- What maracas!
- They`re nice tits.

648
01:11:29,640 --> 01:11:33,474
l`m going on promotional tours
with authors and performers.

649
01:11:33,680 --> 01:11:38,356
l`ll hate leaving Manhattan and missing
certain ballets and concerts.

650
01:11:38,560 --> 01:11:42,075
Tell them about the people
who come to the office.

651
01:11:42,280 --> 01:11:46,478
You know who came in today?
David Bowie, in an astrakhan coat.

652
01:11:46,680 --> 01:11:48,910
- He`s a faggot.
- A half-faggot.

653
01:11:49,120 --> 01:11:53,079
- Relax. Let`s sit down.
- You mean he`s bisexual?

654
01:11:53,280 --> 01:11:57,876
Yeah, he swings both ways.
Men and boys. What`s so funny?

655
01:11:58,080 --> 01:12:01,356
Joe Namath came in today.
You know him?

656
01:12:01,560 --> 01:12:06,509
He wanted some coffee, so I brought
him some, and he asked me to join him.

657
01:12:06,720 --> 01:12:10,076
- Joe Namath?
- Yeah. We were talking a little.

658
01:12:10,280 --> 01:12:15,229
He asked what it was like to be 21 .
I said I didn`t know, because l`m just 20.

659
01:12:15,440 --> 01:12:17,908
- What else?
- That`s all.

660
01:12:18,120 --> 01:12:21,351
- Isn`t that enough?
- Don`t you ever chew, Tony?

661
01:12:21,560 --> 01:12:26,509
- When my mother dies, you get the job.
- Your throat is full of hamburger.

662
01:12:26,720 --> 01:12:31,669
Big gobs, like dog food. Dog Friskies,
Yummies. He`s going to turn into a dog!

663
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:49,434
Stephanie, can I talk to you?

664
01:12:49,640 --> 01:12:55,431
You seem to know a lot of people
and a lot of places and things.

665
01:12:55,640 --> 01:13:01,317
I have a friend. He`s a very good friend,
and he got a girl pregnant.

666
01:13:01,520 --> 01:13:08,631
If you had to choose between abortion
and marriage, what would you do?

667
01:13:08,840 --> 01:13:11,912
Who would I have to marry?

668
01:13:12,120 --> 01:13:15,157
You`d have to marry me.

669
01:13:15,360 --> 01:13:20,275
- l`d get an abortion. So long, Tony!
- It was very nice meeting you.

670
01:13:20,800 --> 01:13:24,759
- What did you think of her?
- I thought she was nice.

671
01:13:24,960 --> 01:13:29,909
- She`s a snotty bitch.
- She`s cool when you get to know her.

672
01:13:30,120 --> 01:13:32,918
- Did you fuck her yet?
- What do you think?

673
01:13:33,120 --> 01:13:37,193
- I don`t think so.
- You guys need to grow up.

674
01:13:37,400 --> 01:13:39,356
You`re babies.

675
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:44,877
I need the afternoon off.

676
01:13:45,080 --> 01:13:47,719
Sam`s out, Harold`s sick. Take these.

677
01:13:47,920 --> 01:13:50,559
- But I have to.
- Sorry, Tony.

678
01:13:50,760 --> 01:13:54,799
l`ve been here almost eight months
and haven`t missed a day!

679
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:57,958
- Not today, Tony.
- Come on, Mr Fusco!

680
01:13:58,160 --> 01:14:01,470
When those old farts miss days,
you say nothing!

681
01:14:01,680 --> 01:14:05,389
- Cool off!
- l`m taking the afternoon off.

682
01:14:05,600 --> 01:14:07,875
- Then you`re fired.
- l`m doing it.

683
01:14:08,080 --> 01:14:12,198
- You`re fired!
- Fuck you, asshole!

684
01:14:12,400 --> 01:14:13,958
And the horse you rode in on.

685
01:14:14,160 --> 01:14:18,472
- Cocksucker asshole!
- I don`t want to marry Pauline.

686
01:14:18,680 --> 01:14:22,878
- Then don`t.
- I have to! She won`t have an abortion.

687
01:14:23,080 --> 01:14:25,753
- Everyone says I have to marry her.
- Who?

688
01:14:25,960 --> 01:14:30,112
Her fucking parents, my fucking
parents, the fucking priest,

689
01:14:30,320 --> 01:14:32,959
her fucking guidance counsellor.

690
01:14:33,160 --> 01:14:35,230
Tony, l`m paralysed.

691
01:14:35,440 --> 01:14:40,468
You and me have been friends
a long time. l`m hurting.

692
01:14:40,680 --> 01:14:46,357
Shit! You`re always together and l`m
always fucking up. You`re always OK.

693
01:14:46,560 --> 01:14:51,395
Everybody fucks up. Really!
Don`t worry about anything.

694
01:14:51,600 --> 01:14:54,910
- You`re great!
- l`m in a rush. I hate to leave you.

695
01:14:55,120 --> 01:14:58,510
I appreciate this.
The car is really important today.

696
01:14:58,720 --> 01:15:01,632
- Call me tonight?
- Yes. Don`t worry.

697
01:15:01,840 --> 01:15:04,752
- Take care.
- Talk to you later, then?

698
01:15:05,120 --> 01:15:07,156
- You`ll call tonight?
- Yeah.

699
01:15:07,360 --> 01:15:10,079
You`ll call me tonight?

700
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:45,231
- Stephanie, this got me fired.
- What?

701
01:15:45,440 --> 01:15:49,877
You couldn`t do it on Sunday,
so my boss fired me.

702
01:15:50,080 --> 01:15:54,631
I wanted everything in,
so I could fix it up on Saturday.

703
01:15:54,840 --> 01:15:58,799
Nobody bitched at my office.
I got the whole day off.

704
01:15:59,960 --> 01:16:04,715
- l`m sorry.
- It`s all right. I can handle it.

705
01:17:04,160 --> 01:17:06,116
Come on in.

706
01:17:06,960 --> 01:17:09,793
Put that over here.

707
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:13,390
- Hey!
- I thought you`d be out of town.

708
01:17:13,600 --> 01:17:15,556
I postponed the trip.

709
01:17:18,800 --> 01:17:22,759
Jay, this is my friend Tony Manero.
This is Jay Langhart.

710
01:17:22,960 --> 01:17:26,157
Unspecified status. How do you do?

711
01:17:26,800 --> 01:17:30,873
- l`m leaving you all the furniture.
- Are you kidding?

712
01:17:31,080 --> 01:17:33,833
You picked out most of it anyway.

713
01:17:34,040 --> 01:17:39,160
- Well, super.
- Nobody says super any more!

714
01:17:39,360 --> 01:17:44,718
- Can I get you a beer, a glass of wine?
- No, it`s all right.

715
01:17:44,920 --> 01:17:48,993
- I read that book you told me to read.
- Kerr or Lawson?

716
01:17:49,200 --> 01:17:52,988
- Kerr.
- You should`ve read the Lawson.

717
01:17:53,200 --> 01:17:57,478
If I can help you guys move in,
l`ll be glad to help.

718
01:18:05,480 --> 01:18:07,516
l`ll get the rest.

719
01:18:18,720 --> 01:18:22,679
- Who is that guy?
- He`s an arranger, a record producer.

720
01:18:22,880 --> 01:18:27,431
He wants to do films. He`s moving
to a more expensive apartment.

721
01:18:27,640 --> 01:18:29,471
I met him at the agency.

722
01:18:29,680 --> 01:18:34,754
He didn`t want his wife to know what
money he had until after the divorce.

723
01:18:35,120 --> 01:18:39,079
- Come on, let`s go.
- I meant, who is he to you?

724
01:18:41,120 --> 01:18:44,271
He`s a friend of mine. He`s a friend.

725
01:18:44,480 --> 01:18:47,438
I was living with him for a little while.

726
01:18:47,640 --> 01:18:50,791
Are you in love with him?
Tell me the story.

727
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:57,394
No! We had a thing, it didn`t work out
and it`s over now, but he still likes me.

728
01:18:57,600 --> 01:19:01,673
He likes to have you around
for a quick piece.

729
01:19:01,880 --> 01:19:05,873
He helped me! lt`s crazy at that place.
You don`t know shit!

730
01:19:06,080 --> 01:19:11,916
I didn`t know how to do stuff,
so l`d ask him and he`d tell me.

731
01:19:12,120 --> 01:19:14,395
And it would be all right.

732
01:19:14,600 --> 01:19:19,594
Otherwise l`d be like an idiot,
saying, ``I don`t know.`` He helps me.

733
01:19:19,800 --> 01:19:22,917
Does he help you
get in and out of the sack?

734
01:19:23,120 --> 01:19:28,558
He helped me. What the hell do you
expect me to do? What do you expect?

735
01:19:28,760 --> 01:19:30,716
He helped me.

736
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:44,199
Don`t cry about it. All right,
so he helped you. That`s good for you.

737
01:19:48,200 --> 01:19:50,953
Let`s get out of here.

738
01:19:51,760 --> 01:19:54,115
l`m sorry.

739
01:19:54,480 --> 01:19:55,754
It`s all right.

740
01:19:55,960 --> 01:19:59,396
Don`t worry about anything.
Don`t worry about that.

741
01:19:59,920 --> 01:20:01,876
Stephanie, don`t.

742
01:20:02,680 --> 01:20:07,117
- We`ll stop here for a while.
- No, don`t stop. Just take me home.

743
01:20:07,320 --> 01:20:11,757
No, we`ll just sit here for a while.
Don`t worry about anything.

744
01:20:17,640 --> 01:20:19,870
It`s pretty, isn`t it?

745
01:20:26,440 --> 01:20:28,396
Sit down.

746
01:20:39,240 --> 01:20:45,190
Do you know how tall that bridge is?
That tower goes up 690 feet.

747
01:20:45,400 --> 01:20:48,870
40 million cars go across a year.

748
01:20:49,080 --> 01:20:53,835
1 27,000 tons of steel is involved in that.

749
01:20:54,560 --> 01:21:00,317
It`s almost three quarters of a million
yards of concrete. That`s right.

750
01:21:00,520 --> 01:21:04,911
The centre span is 4,260 feet long.

751
01:21:05,120 --> 01:21:10,240
With the on-ramps,
it all totals two and a half miles.

752
01:21:11,520 --> 01:21:14,876
You know all about the bridge,
don`t you?

753
01:21:15,680 --> 01:21:17,955
I know everything about that bridge.

754
01:21:18,160 --> 01:21:22,517
Know what else?
There`s a guy buried in the cement.

755
01:21:22,720 --> 01:21:24,676
Really?

756
01:21:24,880 --> 01:21:27,235
Know how it happened?

757
01:21:27,440 --> 01:21:32,639
While they were working on it,
pouring the cement,

758
01:21:32,840 --> 01:21:38,517
he slipped off on the upper part
of the bridge and, you know, fell in.

759
01:21:40,720 --> 01:21:42,631
Dumb fuck.

760
01:21:42,840 --> 01:21:46,469
- What a way to go.
- I come here a lot. I get ideas.

761
01:21:46,680 --> 01:21:49,911
What kind of ideas do you get?

762
01:21:50,120 --> 01:21:53,476
I dunno...daydreams.
I daydream a lot.

763
01:22:17,840 --> 01:22:20,798
Mr Fusco, l`ve come
for what l`ve got coming.

764
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:25,232
- Things got hot under the collar.
- What do you mean?

765
01:22:25,440 --> 01:22:30,719
I don`t want to lose you. You`re a good
kid. The customers like you. Stay.

766
01:22:30,920 --> 01:22:34,230
- l`m not fired?
- No. Come on.

767
01:22:34,440 --> 01:22:37,398
- Unbelievable!
- You`ve got a future here.

768
01:22:37,600 --> 01:22:43,038
Harold`s been here 1 8 years,
since I opened. Mike, 1 5 years!

769
01:22:43,240 --> 01:22:47,199
Give Harold a hand.
He`s making a mess of it.

770
01:23:02,920 --> 01:23:04,638
What are you doing?

771
01:23:06,160 --> 01:23:09,470
- Whoa, man!

772
01:23:09,680 --> 01:23:13,070
I didn`t know
you hung your label on her!

773
01:23:13,280 --> 01:23:16,716
That guy`s the biggest cunt hound
in Bay Ridge.

774
01:23:16,920 --> 01:23:22,153
- My God, l`ve been in serious danger!
- It`s no joke. He`s a sleazy whore.

775
01:23:24,160 --> 01:23:28,870
- I was dancing with him. Dancing.
- No, no, forget it.

776
01:23:29,080 --> 01:23:32,550
- Let`s dance.
- You disgust me.

777
01:23:32,760 --> 01:23:36,719
What do you mean?
I was just dancing with the guy!

778
01:23:41,040 --> 01:23:42,996
- Tony!
- What do you want?

779
01:23:43,200 --> 01:23:45,156
Just look.

780
01:23:50,120 --> 01:23:51,394
Jesus!

781
01:24:37,160 --> 01:24:40,391
Beautiful! There are six,
seven of them and chicks.

782
01:24:40,600 --> 01:24:43,637
- Let`s wait until there are three or four.
- One or two?

783
01:24:43,840 --> 01:24:46,115
- Tony!
- l`m thinking.

784
01:24:46,320 --> 01:24:48,436
- Tony...
- Shut up!

785
01:24:48,640 --> 01:24:52,553
- Back up.
- What are you doing, Double J?

786
01:24:52,760 --> 01:24:55,115
- Backing up.
- Are you crazy?

787
01:24:56,520 --> 01:24:59,114
- l`m getting married.
- Shut up!

788
01:25:00,880 --> 01:25:02,552
Come on, fuckers!

789
01:25:17,520 --> 01:25:18,999
Tony!

790
01:25:26,680 --> 01:25:30,958
- Joey!
- Tony, help me! Please, God!

791
01:25:37,400 --> 01:25:40,358
What the hell do you think you`re doing?

792
01:26:10,920 --> 01:26:15,755
- Tony, come here! lt`s me. Come on!
- Let`s get outta here!

793
01:26:23,800 --> 01:26:25,791
He chickened! Where is he?

794
01:26:34,080 --> 01:26:36,435
Go, man, go!

795
01:26:39,360 --> 01:26:43,114
- Where the hell were you?
- I was just driving around.

796
01:26:43,320 --> 01:26:45,276
I was looking for you.

797
01:26:54,440 --> 01:26:58,479
- Did you get the number of the truck?
- Don`t make me laugh.

798
01:26:58,680 --> 01:27:01,638
- Look. We don`t love you, right?
- We got them.

799
01:27:01,840 --> 01:27:03,796
- Does it hurt?
- Yeah.

800
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:08,790
- Did you really kick their asses?
- We got them, Italian style.

801
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:14,074
That`s great. Except, you know,
l`m not so sure it was the Barracudas.

802
01:27:21,160 --> 01:27:25,438
- You said it was.
- No, I said it probably was.

803
01:27:25,640 --> 01:27:29,599
Don`t pull our legs.
We can get into trouble for that.

804
01:27:29,800 --> 01:27:32,394
You said it probably was.

805
01:27:32,600 --> 01:27:35,876
Yes, but it could have been
the Spanish Barons.

806
01:27:36,080 --> 01:27:39,470
Stupid bastard!
We almost got our heads busted.

807
01:27:39,680 --> 01:27:42,240
Yeah? Not you, lover.

808
01:27:52,520 --> 01:27:58,436
- You`ve got some fucking pair of balls!
- I had to lay somebody out for it.

809
01:27:58,640 --> 01:28:03,714
- Are you stupid? Didn`t you see them?
- If I didn`t say who, they`d gotten off!

810
01:28:03,920 --> 01:28:09,870
Fuck you, Gus! Do you know what?
I feel like breaking your broken leg!

811
01:28:10,080 --> 01:28:12,674
Oh, God, I can`t believe it!

812
01:28:13,520 --> 01:28:16,830
- I could have killed him.
- You couldn`t kill crab lice!

813
01:28:17,040 --> 01:28:20,999
- Do you think l`m a coward?
- What do you think you are?

814
01:28:21,200 --> 01:28:25,352
Enough of that shit!
l`m bored with it, all right?

815
01:28:37,960 --> 01:28:41,919
Hey, look at this. You`re beautiful, babe!

816
01:28:42,120 --> 01:28:45,829
We`ve got the winners here.
Let`s get a table.

817
01:28:48,600 --> 01:28:51,990
- How are you doing?
- l`m all right.

818
01:28:53,040 --> 01:28:56,828
- What happened to your face?
- I cut myself shaving.

819
01:28:57,760 --> 01:29:00,911
- With a switchblade, huh?
- Come on.

820
01:29:57,160 --> 01:30:01,950
A big hand for Shirley Charles
and Chester Bronson!

821
01:30:02,200 --> 01:30:03,918
Be cool, everybody.

822
01:30:04,640 --> 01:30:07,029
No way! No good!

823
01:30:09,520 --> 01:30:13,399
Now we have Stephanie Mangano
and Tony Manero!

824
01:30:21,560 --> 01:30:25,917
- Joey, give me another one of those.
- You`ve had enough.

825
01:30:26,120 --> 01:30:30,079
- All right, get high. It`s your head.
- That`s right.

826
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:53,753
Hey! Hey, be cool!

827
01:33:53,960 --> 01:33:57,999
Now we have couple number 1 5!
The Puerto Rican couple.

828
01:33:58,200 --> 01:34:01,715
Maria Héctor y César Rodriguez!

829
01:34:08,120 --> 01:34:11,715
- Wrong neighbourhood!
- Tony, you`ll take the prize.

830
01:34:52,120 --> 01:34:55,635
- They`re so fucking good.
- They`re spics!

831
01:34:55,840 --> 01:34:58,434
Look at them, greasing up the floor.

832
01:35:47,520 --> 01:35:48,157
Número uno!

833
01:35:49,760 --> 01:35:53,833
- No contest!
- Bullshit. They were better than us.

834
01:35:54,040 --> 01:35:56,918
- No, they were just different.
- Bullshit.

835
01:35:57,120 --> 01:35:59,839
Folks, we have the judges` decision.

836
01:36:00,040 --> 01:36:05,068
In third place we have Elizabeth
and Joseph Cursa. Give them a hand!

837
01:36:12,120 --> 01:36:17,956
Second prize! From Puerto Rico,
César Rodriguez and Maria Héctor!

838
01:36:20,280 --> 01:36:23,238
- You`re doing them a favour!
- You`ll take the prize.

839
01:36:25,760 --> 01:36:28,399
Don`t spend it in one place.

840
01:36:29,360 --> 01:36:35,515
In first place, the coolest, Brooklyn`s
Fred Astaire, the boogie-woogie man.

841
01:36:35,720 --> 01:36:38,154
He was hot! He was right on!

842
01:36:38,360 --> 01:36:41,830
Stephanie Mangano and Tony Manero!

843
01:36:44,280 --> 01:36:46,430
We won!

844
01:36:47,560 --> 01:36:50,120
Come on. Come on!

845
01:37:08,480 --> 01:37:11,119
Come on, let`s boogie!

846
01:37:20,720 --> 01:37:24,679
- You put them down!
- You phoney bastards!

847
01:37:24,880 --> 01:37:31,149
You know who should have won.
My friends can`t be straight with me!

848
01:37:31,360 --> 01:37:33,920
- Up your ass!
- We won it.

849
01:37:34,120 --> 01:37:39,114
It was rigged. That`s like family.
They can`t give it to a spic, a stranger!

850
01:37:39,320 --> 01:37:43,632
- We were just as good, and I know it.
- You think so?

851
01:37:48,720 --> 01:37:50,676
Come with me.

852
01:37:50,880 --> 01:37:52,233
Excuse me.

853
01:37:52,440 --> 01:37:57,992
Congratulations. l`d like to give you this,
because I think you deserve it.

854
01:37:59,960 --> 01:38:03,316
- If the spics are good, they deserve it.
- But we won!

855
01:38:03,520 --> 01:38:06,114
This is a fucking shithole!

856
01:38:06,320 --> 01:38:11,075
The assholes I hang out with.
I can`t believe them sometimes.

857
01:38:11,280 --> 01:38:16,673
Everybody has to dump on somebody!
Nobody can do it straight, right?

858
01:38:16,880 --> 01:38:21,237
My pa gets dumped on at work,
so he dumps on my mother.

859
01:38:21,440 --> 01:38:24,512
The spics dump on us,
so we have to dump on them.

860
01:38:24,720 --> 01:38:29,669
Everybody`s dumping on everybody.
Even the humping is dumping.

861
01:38:29,880 --> 01:38:35,557
- All right, tell me what`s wrong.
- Get in. Get in!

862
01:38:43,120 --> 01:38:46,078
What the hell is wrong with you?

863
01:38:51,960 --> 01:38:54,030
Stop it!

864
01:38:54,240 --> 01:38:58,756
- Leave me alone. Get away!
- You`re such a fucking cockteaser.

865
01:38:58,960 --> 01:39:02,714
- Don`t call me that!
- Why do you hang around with me?

866
01:39:02,920 --> 01:39:05,275
- Dancing.
- Dancing? Why else?

867
01:39:05,480 --> 01:39:10,315
You want to know? lt`s bullshit!
l`ve been dumping my bullshit on you.

868
01:39:10,520 --> 01:39:15,310
Selling my act on you. Making
you think I love you. It`s all bullshit!

869
01:39:15,520 --> 01:39:19,798
- You fucking cunt!
- You stop it! Don`t!

870
01:39:21,440 --> 01:39:23,396
Get off me!

871
01:39:24,120 --> 01:39:26,076
Oh, Stephanie.

872
01:39:41,440 --> 01:39:46,230
- l`m mad at you, Tony.
- Annette`s giving everybody snatch pie!

873
01:39:47,160 --> 01:39:50,436
- The fuck you are.
- What are you doing?

874
01:39:50,640 --> 01:39:54,599
What is with you? And you, you punk?
You little fuck!

875
01:39:54,800 --> 01:39:57,758
- What is it?
- You don`t give a shit about her!

876
01:40:00,400 --> 01:40:02,834
Annette, get in the car.

877
01:40:10,760 --> 01:40:13,069
Go on. Do it.

878
01:40:18,280 --> 01:40:21,909
I told you.
You can fuck all night on speed.

879
01:40:22,120 --> 01:40:26,750
- Joey, what are you doing?
- The first is always the best.

880
01:40:47,840 --> 01:40:50,798
Come on, Double J. You`re up.

881
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:53,389
See you guys later.

882
01:40:57,520 --> 01:41:00,876
Come on! We`ll have a good time.

883
01:41:01,080 --> 01:41:03,275
I don`t want to do it.

884
01:41:08,360 --> 01:41:10,669
Fuck!

885
01:41:12,520 --> 01:41:14,476
Shit! With me she cries.

886
01:41:14,680 --> 01:41:18,639
- Goddamn, Annette.
- No, don`t. No, no.

887
01:41:29,760 --> 01:41:31,034
Yeah!

888
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:38,592
Double J!

889
01:41:38,800 --> 01:41:41,360
Come on, Double J!

890
01:41:46,760 --> 01:41:48,990
A beer!

891
01:41:49,680 --> 01:41:52,638
With no pants and no hands!

892
01:41:53,320 --> 01:41:55,072
Beer!

893
01:41:59,800 --> 01:42:03,952
Fuck you, Manhattan!
Come to Brooklyn!

894
01:42:06,720 --> 01:42:11,794
- Mine`s so big I have to strap it down.
- Anita says mine is the biggest in town.

895
01:42:12,680 --> 01:42:15,069
Are you proud of yourself, Annette?

896
01:42:15,280 --> 01:42:18,636
Is that what you wanted? Good.

897
01:42:20,200 --> 01:42:22,873
Now you`re a cunt.

898
01:42:24,720 --> 01:42:27,154
What are you doing?

899
01:42:28,560 --> 01:42:30,915
Where are you going?

900
01:42:42,600 --> 01:42:45,160
Come on, Annette. l`m sorry.

901
01:42:46,240 --> 01:42:50,199
- I said l`m sorry.
- I didn`t want to do it.

902
01:42:51,760 --> 01:42:56,436
- Look at this guy! Bobby, you punk!
- Tony!

903
01:42:57,120 --> 01:43:01,193
- Look at me!
- Bobby, get down! lt`s too dangerous.

904
01:43:01,400 --> 01:43:03,755
Look at me, Tony!

905
01:43:04,920 --> 01:43:07,718
Look at me! Hey, Tony!

906
01:43:09,680 --> 01:43:13,912
- l`m not kidding. Get down from there.
- l`m all right.

907
01:43:15,240 --> 01:43:19,199
l`m all right, Tony. l`m all right.
Watch me.

908
01:43:26,440 --> 01:43:29,796
- Tony, look at me.
- Now you`re being crazy.

909
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:33,072
- Look at me. l`m doing it!
- It`s dangerous.

910
01:43:33,280 --> 01:43:34,838
Look at me!

911
01:43:36,280 --> 01:43:38,236
Oh, Jesus.

912
01:43:44,600 --> 01:43:48,195
Give me your hand. Come back in.

913
01:43:51,560 --> 01:43:54,996
- Watch!
- Don`t! You`re making me nervous.

914
01:43:55,200 --> 01:43:57,156
Don`t do that.

915
01:43:57,360 --> 01:44:00,670
Get over here right now. I mean it!

916
01:44:02,480 --> 01:44:04,710
Jesus, no!

917
01:44:06,240 --> 01:44:07,992
- I did it.
- What?

918
01:44:08,200 --> 01:44:11,636
- I did it.
- What?

919
01:44:15,280 --> 01:44:18,352
Get over here right now. Come on.

920
01:44:18,560 --> 01:44:23,395
- Don`t be upset. We`ll talk in the car.
- You didn`t talk to me before.

921
01:44:25,160 --> 01:44:28,436
How come you never called me?

922
01:44:30,240 --> 01:44:34,199
- I didn`t want to fuck up.
- You didn`t. We`ll talk.

923
01:44:34,400 --> 01:44:36,960
I didn`t want to fuck up this time.

924
01:45:09,080 --> 01:45:12,834
Any of you think
maybe he killed himself?

925
01:45:17,400 --> 01:45:21,598
There are ways of killing yourself
without killing yourself.

926
01:45:21,800 --> 01:45:23,950
You can go now.

927
01:45:29,400 --> 01:45:33,359
Forget the number, Chief.
We won`t find anything tonight.

928
01:45:36,080 --> 01:45:37,433
Shit.

929
01:45:50,040 --> 01:45:51,314
Tone?

930
01:45:53,080 --> 01:45:53,876
Hey, Tony!

931
01:47:56,680 --> 01:47:58,910
Stephanie?

932
01:48:00,840 --> 01:48:02,910
- Is that you?
- Yeah, it`s me.

933
01:48:03,120 --> 01:48:06,556
- l`m really sorry about last night.
- You`re sorry?

934
01:48:06,760 --> 01:48:11,276
Yeah, l`m sorry.
It won`t happen again, I promise.

935
01:48:11,480 --> 01:48:15,996
- I really need to talk to you.
- What do you mean by that?

936
01:48:16,200 --> 01:48:19,158
Just like I said, I need to talk to you.

937
01:48:20,880 --> 01:48:25,032
If I open the door,
you won`t pull anything on me, right?

938
01:48:25,240 --> 01:48:27,674
No, of course not.

939
01:48:37,440 --> 01:48:40,273
First time l`ve let a rapist in.

940
01:48:40,480 --> 01:48:46,430
l`ll just stay right here. That way
you don`t think l`m going to jump you.

941
01:48:50,200 --> 01:48:52,998
What`s wrong with you?

942
01:48:56,280 --> 01:48:58,953
Nothing. l`ll tell you later.

943
01:49:00,400 --> 01:49:04,359
You can`t just stand there.
This is ridiculous. Come on.

944
01:49:07,200 --> 01:49:13,150
l`ve been up all night, walking around.
l`m going to get myself my own place.

945
01:49:13,360 --> 01:49:16,318
l`m getting my money and coming back.

946
01:49:16,520 --> 01:49:20,229
Why don`t you sit down? Come on.

947
01:49:23,840 --> 01:49:28,516
- So what are you doing?
- l`m not going back there.

948
01:49:28,720 --> 01:49:33,669
- They`re assholes. l`m fed up with it.
- OK. What are you going to do?

949
01:49:33,880 --> 01:49:37,839
You get a job. Do what you do.
Get a nice apartment.

950
01:49:38,040 --> 01:49:40,793
OK. What kind of job?

951
01:49:41,720 --> 01:49:45,679
I don`t know. What did you do?
You couldn`t do anything.

952
01:49:45,880 --> 01:49:48,553
I could type.

953
01:49:49,920 --> 01:49:53,071
l`m an able person.
I can do these things.

954
01:49:53,280 --> 01:49:55,032
Of course you can.

955
01:49:57,560 --> 01:50:00,199
Tony, I want to tell you something.

956
01:50:00,400 --> 01:50:04,791
You know, I said all that stuff
to you about...

957
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:08,549
...using you, practising my act on you.

958
01:50:08,760 --> 01:50:13,390
It wasn`t true. There were other reasons
why I was hanging around you.

959
01:50:13,600 --> 01:50:18,037
- What do you mean?
- You made me feel better.

960
01:50:18,240 --> 01:50:23,030
You gave me admiration, you know?
Respect. Support.

961
01:50:27,960 --> 01:50:32,556
Stephanie, maybe now,
when l`m going to be in town,

962
01:50:32,760 --> 01:50:35,832
maybe we could see each other.

963
01:50:36,040 --> 01:50:41,876
I don`t mean like that. I know you`re
thinking l`m promoting your pussy.

964
01:50:42,080 --> 01:50:46,039
I mean like friends. Like you said:
we could help each other.

965
01:50:46,920 --> 01:50:50,754
- You want to be friends?
- l`d like to be friends with you.

966
01:50:52,800 --> 01:50:54,836
Do you think you know how?

967
01:50:55,040 --> 01:50:59,989
Do you think you could be friends
with a girl? Could you stand that?

968
01:51:00,800 --> 01:51:03,758
The truth? I don`t know.

969
01:51:04,440 --> 01:51:07,910
I could try. That`s all I can say.

970
01:51:14,600 --> 01:51:16,716
OK.

971
01:51:16,920 --> 01:51:20,879
Let`s be friends, all right?
We`ll just be friends.

972
01:51:21,480 --> 01:51:23,436
All right.

973
01:51:29,360 --> 01:51:30,679
Friends, man.

974
01:54:05,480 --> 01:54:06,754
