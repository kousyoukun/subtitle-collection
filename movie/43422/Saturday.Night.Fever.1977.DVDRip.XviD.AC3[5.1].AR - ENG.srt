1
00:01:53,713 --> 00:01:58,241
- Hi, Tony! Two or three?
- Two. Give me two. That's good.

2
00:02:49,435 --> 00:02:51,733
Do you do lay-away?

3
00:02:51,938 --> 00:02:54,907
lf it doesn't turn into
a 20-year mortgage.

4
00:02:55,141 --> 00:02:59,237
Here's five dollars for the blue shirt
in the window. Hold it for me.

5
00:02:59,445 --> 00:03:02,209
- Wait for your receipt!
- l trust you.

6
00:03:02,382 --> 00:03:04,748
Please don't trust me.

7
00:03:54,434 --> 00:03:56,459
- What did he charge you?
- 7.98.

8
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:59,330
Wait until he runs out.
You know what to tell her?

9
00:04:01,374 --> 00:04:03,433
- Got a second?
- Just a minute.

10
00:04:03,676 --> 00:04:08,773
- Look what l've got. Carnival Gold.
- l've waited half an hour for this paint.

11
00:04:08,982 --> 00:04:13,146
l'll make you a deal.
l'll make you a nice deal on this.

12
00:04:13,353 --> 00:04:17,346
A dollar off.
1 0.98 on this special gold paint.

13
00:04:17,557 --> 00:04:19,218
- How do you like that?
- Thank you.

14
00:04:19,392 --> 00:04:23,658
- l'll take a gallon of this.
- You got it. Let's go!

15
00:04:25,164 --> 00:04:29,965
That's all right. Customers like that.
lt gives them a sense of power.

16
00:04:30,169 --> 00:04:34,503
- l need some brushes.
- How much painting do you plan to do?

17
00:04:34,707 --> 00:04:37,801
After this l wouldn't paint
my wife's ass purple.

18
00:04:38,011 --> 00:04:41,378
- What colour is it now?
- You ask me about my wife's ass?!

19
00:04:41,581 --> 00:04:47,679
- You brought it up.
- lt has no colour, just stretch stripes.

20
00:04:47,887 --> 00:04:52,881
- What about the brushes?
- The second display counter there.

21
00:04:59,365 --> 00:05:02,892
- Mr Fusco, can l have an advance?
- Payday is Monday.

22
00:05:03,102 --> 00:05:07,266
l know, but every place else
pays on Friday or Saturday.

23
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:13,003
And they're broke on Monday. Booze,
whores, pissing away their money.

24
00:05:13,212 --> 00:05:18,013
This way you've got money all week.
You can save for the future.

25
00:05:18,217 --> 00:05:23,018
- Fuck the future!
- No, Tony, you can't fuck the future.

26
00:05:23,222 --> 00:05:29,218
The future catches up with you, and it
fucks you if you haven't planned for it.

27
00:05:29,429 --> 00:05:34,196
Tonight is the future, and l'm planning
for it. There's a shirt l have to buy...

28
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:37,494
Sorry, Tony. No exceptions.

29
00:05:39,072 --> 00:05:43,031
Just wait until you need
an advance, bigshot!

30
00:05:50,917 --> 00:05:52,578
Thanks, Tony!

31
00:06:06,099 --> 00:06:08,932
Where have you been?

32
00:06:10,136 --> 00:06:13,731
Your mother wants to know
where you've been.

33
00:06:14,741 --> 00:06:19,678
- Where have you been?
- Your father asked where you've been.

34
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:25,078
Dinner will be late. Things had sold out
at the market. Normally you'd be late!

35
00:06:25,518 --> 00:06:27,986
- Hey, Tony!
- Hot stuff, give me a kiss.

36
00:06:28,187 --> 00:06:31,281
- Look what l made for you.
- That is beautiful.

37
00:06:31,491 --> 00:06:35,086
- Like it? Will you put it in your room?
- Yeah, l'll put it in my room right now.

38
00:07:49,101 --> 00:07:52,002
- Dinner's on the table.
- l'm not hungry.

39
00:07:52,205 --> 00:07:58,041
Just because you're kicking in for food,
doesn't mean you don't eat.

40
00:07:58,244 --> 00:08:00,644
- l've got my shirt on.
- So?

41
00:08:00,847 --> 00:08:05,250
- l don't want to get anything on it.
- You don't have to worry.

42
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:10,184
Your mother's spaghetti sauce
doesn't drip or taste.

43
00:08:11,023 --> 00:08:13,150
Let's go!

44
00:08:22,869 --> 00:08:24,496
lt's always the same.

45
00:08:24,704 --> 00:08:29,903
You say l'm late for dinner, but l work
until six and can't make dinner in time.

46
00:08:30,109 --> 00:08:34,842
You should've been a priest, like your
brother. You wouldn't worry about a job.

47
00:08:35,047 --> 00:08:36,378
Yeah.

48
00:08:36,649 --> 00:08:42,747
- Must you always cross yourself?
- He's a priest. Father Frank Junior.

49
00:08:42,955 --> 00:08:46,391
She doesn't have much to cross herself
about these days.

50
00:08:46,592 --> 00:08:50,358
- You're so jealous of Frank Junior.
- Shut up!

51
00:08:52,632 --> 00:08:58,298
- Hey, watch the shirt, stupid!
- Basta! Mangia, mangia!

52
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:03,703
- Eat. l've got more pork chops.
- More pork chops? l'm out of work!

53
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:07,812
As long as we have a dollar,
we eat good. l might get a job.

54
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:13,542
Like hell! 25 years in construction
work. l've always had a paycheque.

55
00:09:13,753 --> 00:09:19,453
For 6, 7 months l'm out of work,
and all of a sudden you hit me.

56
00:09:19,692 --> 00:09:25,426
- And talk back. Talk of getting a job.
- OK, no hitting at the dinner table.

57
00:09:25,631 --> 00:09:30,898
- You were the one who was hitting.
- You never hit me before. Never.

58
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:33,732
Not in front of the kids.

59
00:09:39,445 --> 00:09:42,937
- One pork chop!
- Hey, Frank!

60
00:09:43,149 --> 00:09:44,548
lt's disgusting.

61
00:09:45,618 --> 00:09:48,587
Would you just watch the hair?

62
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:53,919
l work on my hair a long time,
and you hit it. He hits my hair.

63
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:59,656
Take care of his hair.
l'm going to take a walk.

64
00:10:04,403 --> 00:10:08,271
- Will you walk me to church?
- Haven't you been today?

65
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:12,172
- Confession. l must go back and pray.
- For what?

66
00:10:13,312 --> 00:10:17,271
- For Father Frank Junior to call me.
- Why not call him?

67
00:10:17,483 --> 00:10:23,353
- A son should call his mother.
- You'll ask God to make Frank call you?

68
00:10:24,657 --> 00:10:27,490
- Right.
- l don't believe it.

69
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:31,523
You're turning God
into a telephone operator.

70
00:10:51,217 --> 00:10:53,913
You scumbags! Get back here.

71
00:10:55,054 --> 00:10:57,420
- Assholes.
- Come on, fuckhead!

72
00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:01,523
The stubborn fuck won't budge!

73
00:11:18,878 --> 00:11:21,506
- Put your hands on the wheel.
- l have!

74
00:11:21,714 --> 00:11:26,378
- You almost broke my pussy finger.
- You wouldn't know which one it was.

75
00:11:26,585 --> 00:11:29,247
Have some. Tell them what we have.

76
00:11:29,455 --> 00:11:34,518
We have ups, downs, three ludes,
two jays and half a bottle of vodka.

77
00:11:34,727 --> 00:11:38,390
You get a bigger high from a fart!

78
00:11:38,597 --> 00:11:42,556
- You want something?
- We're not dropping until l say so.

79
00:11:42,768 --> 00:11:46,670
- Why not?
- l've got my reasons.

80
00:11:46,839 --> 00:11:49,672
- What's wrong with you?
- Give me the vodka.

81
00:11:49,842 --> 00:11:52,538
Get some new tapes. These are old.

82
00:11:52,745 --> 00:11:57,182
l got them in the bargain basement.
lf you don't like them, l'll get new ones.

83
00:12:29,882 --> 00:12:31,577
Looking sharp, huh?

84
00:12:31,784 --> 00:12:34,844
- Any sharper and you'd be a nigger.
- Or a spic.

85
00:12:35,054 --> 00:12:38,615
Would you put your dick in a spic?
Does it get bigger in a nigger?

86
00:12:38,824 --> 00:12:42,521
- l don't know.
- l've got to score tonight. l'm horny!

87
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:44,992
Yeah, l know what you mean.

88
00:12:45,197 --> 00:12:48,963
Anybody who scores
gets ten minutes in the car.

89
00:12:49,168 --> 00:12:54,333
- Make five and you get the Pope's ass!
- The Pope doesn't have an ass.

90
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:56,132
Shape up. We're the Faces.

91
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:33,976
Tony, how's it going?

92
00:13:52,231 --> 00:13:54,392
Hey, Mark!

93
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:10,406
Tony, have you seen Pauline here?

94
00:14:10,883 --> 00:14:15,582
- No, we haven't seen Pauline.
- Have you seen Pauline?

95
00:14:15,788 --> 00:14:19,246
- What would you like?
- Give me a ''7 7''.

96
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:22,052
- A beer.
- A vodka and tonic.

97
00:14:22,261 --> 00:14:24,559
Are you seeing the Knicks on Tuesday?

98
00:14:43,282 --> 00:14:45,045
Tony.

99
00:14:46,118 --> 00:14:48,643
- Yeah?
- What do you mean ''yeah''?

100
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:54,349
l mean, l can dance with you, but
you're not my dream girl or anything.

101
00:14:56,428 --> 00:15:00,956
You want a dream girl?
Then go to sleep and have a nightmare.

102
00:15:02,101 --> 00:15:06,162
- Gus, here's the speed.
- What are you doing? Take this.

103
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:09,499
Hello! This is Monty, your delicious DJ,

104
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:14,736
reminding you about the disco
sweepstakes. Get in line to get the prize!

105
00:15:45,311 --> 00:15:49,839
What a trip! A good trip!
Feel the music, baby.

106
00:15:58,090 --> 00:16:00,354
l want to dance with that chick.

107
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:02,959
- Which one?
- Just there.

108
00:16:05,331 --> 00:16:07,697
Come on, Tony, dance!

109
00:16:41,533 --> 00:16:47,403
lt's so beautiful, man. l like your new
haircut. l like that polyester look.

110
00:17:04,289 --> 00:17:08,419
Tony, you're the king out there.
You're a great dancer.

111
00:17:08,627 --> 00:17:12,688
- You'd be as good if you practised.
- Could l be a good dancer?

112
00:17:12,898 --> 00:17:16,493
- Sure, why not? No.
- No?

113
00:17:16,668 --> 00:17:20,570
- Won't you ask me to sit down?
- No, you'd do it.

114
00:17:20,773 --> 00:17:24,106
- But you'd ask me to lay down.
- No, you would not do it.

115
00:17:24,309 --> 00:17:27,403
Double J, move over.
Meet my friend, here.

116
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:32,810
Tony, do you want some speed?
lt's really good stuff.

117
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:39,116
- Can't you guys get off on dancing?
- Tony, can l wipe off your forehead?

118
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:42,256
Why not? Go ahead.

119
00:17:45,097 --> 00:17:47,031
lt's no blow job.

120
00:17:47,966 --> 00:17:53,233
You don't know fuck about women. You
get a blow job easier than you get that.

121
00:17:53,439 --> 00:17:59,435
l love to watch you dance, Tony.
l love it. l love to watch you dance!

122
00:17:59,645 --> 00:18:03,945
l just love it. Watching you dance.

123
00:18:04,149 --> 00:18:07,050
Why don't you take her for a dance?

124
00:18:07,219 --> 00:18:11,087
That's a good idea.
Would you like to dance?

125
00:18:12,524 --> 00:18:16,961
Any dressing with the lace on the side.
Weirdest chick l've ever seen.

126
00:18:17,863 --> 00:18:21,993
l love to. l love to watch you dance!

127
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:26,833
l just love it. Watching you dance.

128
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:32,840
Doreen, move up a little bit.
You look like you're doing two-step.

129
00:18:33,045 --> 00:18:36,208
Get your head out of his belt!

130
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:39,145
Oh, Jesus!

131
00:18:39,351 --> 00:18:42,218
You can't dance to this shit!

132
00:18:49,161 --> 00:18:52,858
- Monty, why are you playing that shit?
- What?

133
00:18:53,065 --> 00:18:56,865
Look at that chick.
She's dancing, she's moving.

134
00:19:23,795 --> 00:19:26,025
Joe, you know that girl?

135
00:19:29,535 --> 00:19:32,129
- No.
- Seen her before?

136
00:19:32,371 --> 00:19:33,702
No.

137
00:19:34,373 --> 00:19:38,036
Yeah, l saw her here
about a month ago.

138
00:19:43,615 --> 00:19:45,708
She can dance.

139
00:19:45,918 --> 00:19:49,877
She's got the wrong partner,
but she can dance.

140
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:53,351
Ask her.

141
00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:56,221
- Fuck you.
- Which position?

142
00:20:05,904 --> 00:20:07,394
Who's that guy?

143
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:23,077
- Hey, Teddy.
- Hey, Tony!

144
00:20:23,288 --> 00:20:25,950
- How are you?
- OK, and you?

145
00:20:26,158 --> 00:20:29,423
- Will you dance for me?
- Sure, why not?

146
00:20:33,465 --> 00:20:36,263
- Hello, Lucille.
- Nureyev, how are you?

147
00:20:36,468 --> 00:20:39,631
- Do you have a ''7 7''?
- Sure, doll.

148
00:20:39,838 --> 00:20:42,466
Give me one of your butts, too.

149
00:20:47,012 --> 00:20:51,312
- They're having another sweepstakes.
- l know that.

150
00:20:51,516 --> 00:20:54,713
lt's double the prize money, $500.

151
00:20:59,057 --> 00:21:03,118
Are you going to enter?
You'll need a partner.

152
00:21:10,135 --> 00:21:14,003
- We won before.
- We're going to have to practise.

153
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:20,644
- We'll have to practise.
- People are coming from Manhattan.

154
00:21:20,846 --> 00:21:25,374
- Revelation Gazebo, you know?
- We'll have to practise.

155
00:21:25,584 --> 00:21:31,284
Let's practise, Annette. l don't mean
dating or socialising. l mean practise.

156
00:21:33,225 --> 00:21:38,390
- Why not? We had a date.
- Yeah, once. And once was enough.

157
00:21:39,164 --> 00:21:41,894
- Why?
- Why?

158
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:47,128
You only talked about your married
sister. And your other married sister.

159
00:21:47,339 --> 00:21:54,507
And your third married sister. l felt that
you just wanted to be a married sister.

160
00:21:54,713 --> 00:21:57,511
Look, l told you l'd take care of it.

161
00:21:57,716 --> 00:22:01,982
Double J has been in the car
25 minutes with some chick.

162
00:22:02,187 --> 00:22:05,088
l can't get the selfish prick out.

163
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:08,384
These guys can't do nothing
without me.

164
00:22:23,041 --> 00:22:27,000
- You gonna make it with Annette?
- l don't think so.

165
00:22:27,212 --> 00:22:31,740
lf you make it with some chicks,
they think you'll dance with them.

166
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:35,386
Get out! You've been in there
20 minutes.

167
00:22:35,587 --> 00:22:40,752
- 25 in the car, 20 in the chick.
- Get out before we pull you out.

168
00:22:40,959 --> 00:22:44,554
- She hasn't come.
- Since when did you care?

169
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:49,391
Come on!

170
00:22:50,268 --> 00:22:53,203
OK, it's happening.

171
00:22:53,405 --> 00:22:58,035
lt's happening, it's happening!
l'll be out in a minute.

172
00:22:58,643 --> 00:23:01,976
Harder! l'm coming, l'm coming!

173
00:23:12,791 --> 00:23:14,019
What was your name?

174
00:23:36,982 --> 00:23:39,007
Kiss me.

175
00:23:39,217 --> 00:23:41,276
Kiss me!

176
00:23:44,356 --> 00:23:47,257
l just kissed Al Pacino!

177
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:27,744
l don't look like Al Pacino.

178
00:26:30,021 --> 00:26:33,855
l could look like him. Al Pacino.

179
00:26:34,326 --> 00:26:36,988
Yeah. Al Pacino.

180
00:26:39,664 --> 00:26:41,689
Al Pacino!

181
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:44,425
Attica, Attica!

182
00:26:44,636 --> 00:26:48,595
- Attica, Attica, Attica!
- Give me the ball!

183
00:26:49,975 --> 00:26:55,140
- Wanna see the Bruce Lee picture?
- He's dead, so l don't give a damn.

184
00:26:55,347 --> 00:26:57,872
Have you no respect for the guy?

185
00:26:58,883 --> 00:27:03,081
- See what the Knicks pay Frazier?
- We'll never make that much money.

186
00:27:03,254 --> 00:27:07,020
- Hey, douche, douche!
- lt's all right.

187
00:27:07,225 --> 00:27:11,355
- Why don't you kill fags on Sunday?
- 'Cause then they'll go to heaven.

188
00:27:11,563 --> 00:27:15,863
Hey, sweetheart! You're terrific!

189
00:27:16,067 --> 00:27:18,160
Hey, double dirty!

190
00:27:18,370 --> 00:27:22,500
- This is a drag.
- What's with you today?

191
00:27:22,707 --> 00:27:26,234
- l'm not sure l'll do 2001 tonight.
- Fucking do it!

192
00:27:26,444 --> 00:27:30,505
Do you have 20-30 bucks
to blow twice a week?

193
00:27:30,715 --> 00:27:32,649
Come on, Tony!

194
00:27:32,851 --> 00:27:38,915
- l'm going to get one of these.
- You'll never have that kind of money.

195
00:27:39,157 --> 00:27:44,322
- That's your favourite speech!
- We'll never have that much money.

196
00:27:44,529 --> 00:27:48,363
Get it together before it's all over.
A Caddy Seville.

197
00:27:48,566 --> 00:27:51,228
My uncle has one, plus a Mercedes.

198
00:27:51,436 --> 00:27:54,928
He got them by forcing
his partner to sell out.

199
00:27:55,173 --> 00:27:58,336
- lt's a dog-eat-dog world.
- lt's true.

200
00:27:59,978 --> 00:28:03,641
They have it all locked up.
Nobody will give you a chance.

201
00:28:03,815 --> 00:28:07,911
- Nobody gives you nothing.
- lt's every man for himself.

202
00:28:08,119 --> 00:28:10,644
lt's a stinking rat race.

203
00:28:12,290 --> 00:28:17,455
- Best vinyl l've ever seen at that price!
- l told you. You just listen to me.

204
00:28:17,696 --> 00:28:23,100
You saved me a bit of change. lf you
ever want to be a painter, let me know.

205
00:28:23,301 --> 00:28:27,294
You make twice as much as here.
Are you interested?

206
00:28:27,505 --> 00:28:29,063
l don't know.

207
00:28:29,274 --> 00:28:33,074
You make twice as much,
but break your back!

208
00:28:33,278 --> 00:28:36,441
- No advances, nothing...
- l gave you a raise.

209
00:28:36,648 --> 00:28:38,707
- What?
- A raise.

210
00:28:38,917 --> 00:28:42,444
- Are you kidding?
- Come on, see how much it is.

211
00:28:42,654 --> 00:28:46,454
- Thank you. l can't believe this.
- You better look.

212
00:28:46,658 --> 00:28:50,822
- lt doesn't matter. You gave me a raise.
- lt's only 2.50.

213
00:28:51,029 --> 00:28:54,590
- So what?
- $2.50 ain't much.

214
00:28:54,799 --> 00:29:01,932
- The important thing is that it's a raise.
- l'll give you 3.50 next week. A dollar...

215
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:06,907
Shut up, will you? Four.
l'll make it an even four.

216
00:29:07,112 --> 00:29:10,912
Never seen anybody so happy
over a crummy 2.50 raise!

217
00:29:11,116 --> 00:29:14,882
Two? You just said $4, didn't you?

218
00:29:19,524 --> 00:29:22,618
- What the hell are you doing?
- l feel like it.

219
00:29:22,827 --> 00:29:26,422
- Girls do that.
- l got a raise today.

220
00:29:26,631 --> 00:29:32,592
Why didn't you say that during dinner?
Put them down. How much did you get?

221
00:29:32,804 --> 00:29:35,272
lt will be $4.00.

222
00:29:35,473 --> 00:29:40,934
lt was 2.50, but he raised the raise
when he saw l wasn't disappointed.

223
00:29:41,146 --> 00:29:42,477
$4.00?

224
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:48,175
Shit! Do you know what $4.00 buys
today? Not even $3.00!

225
00:29:48,386 --> 00:29:53,551
- Has Unemployment given you a raise?
- $4.00? Shit!

226
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:59,196
l knew you'd piss on it. Go on, piss
on it! A raise means that you're good.

227
00:29:59,397 --> 00:30:03,766
How many times has somebody
told me l was good? Two times.

228
00:30:03,935 --> 00:30:06,904
This raise and dancing at the disco.

229
00:30:07,105 --> 00:30:10,666
You sure as fuck never did. Asshole!

230
00:30:11,743 --> 00:30:14,906
$4.00. Shit!

231
00:30:34,699 --> 00:30:40,035
- Why aren't you waiting inside?
- l wanted to watch you walk.

232
00:30:40,238 --> 00:30:41,899
Shit.

233
00:30:42,106 --> 00:30:46,907
Tony, listen...l've been thinking.

234
00:30:47,111 --> 00:30:52,310
- Maybe l'll make it with you.
- You call that thinking? Jesus Christ!

235
00:30:53,084 --> 00:30:55,314
You're too much, Annette.

236
00:30:55,486 --> 00:31:00,219
lf you say we're going to make it,
then we'll make it? So l have no say?

237
00:31:00,425 --> 00:31:03,360
lt's time we went out. You wanted to.

238
00:31:03,561 --> 00:31:10,228
You told me how horny a man gets
at 1 9. His balls ache if he doesn't get it.

239
00:31:10,435 --> 00:31:12,699
How do you remember those things?

240
00:31:12,904 --> 00:31:17,398
We're gonna be spending
a lot of time together practising.

241
00:31:17,609 --> 00:31:22,945
lf we were balling, we'd be going
together. l don't want to go with you.

242
00:31:23,147 --> 00:31:27,880
- Are you a nice girl or a cunt?
- l don't know. Both?

243
00:31:28,086 --> 00:31:33,854
You can't be both. A girl has to decide
early on what she's going to be.

244
00:31:34,025 --> 00:31:36,289
- Hi, Pete.
- Tony, my man!

245
00:31:36,494 --> 00:31:39,054
- Do you have a free studio?
- Two.

246
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:44,224
- How are you doing?
- Steady at 65%.

247
00:31:44,435 --> 00:31:47,495
Pete! He's always busting my onions.

248
00:31:47,705 --> 00:31:52,267
- l send customers and get free studio...
- What's 65% ?

249
00:31:53,411 --> 00:31:56,812
That means that he...

250
00:31:57,015 --> 00:32:00,951
He scores with 65% of the chicks
that come in here.

251
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:08,392
One-two-three, two-two-three.

252
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:12,120
One-two, one-two-three, one-two-three.
Good!

253
00:32:14,465 --> 00:32:17,400
Good. That's it. Do it again.

254
00:32:27,345 --> 00:32:31,304
- That's it. Good. Again.
- Tony, it's only dancing!

255
00:32:31,516 --> 00:32:36,044
lf you're not going to take this seriously,
l don't want to dance.

256
00:32:36,254 --> 00:32:38,722
- Don't get mad.
- Don't get mad?

257
00:32:42,327 --> 00:32:45,660
l think we've done enough dancing
for today.

258
00:32:45,863 --> 00:32:49,299
- So let's dance on Wednesday?
- Yeah, sure.

259
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:56,634
- Are you going home now?
- No, l'm going to talk to Peter.

260
00:32:56,841 --> 00:32:59,571
And work on some stuff myself.

261
00:32:59,777 --> 00:33:03,941
See you later. You were good today.

262
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:33,876
Hi. How are you doing?

263
00:33:36,781 --> 00:33:40,217
You're a very good dancer,
you know that?

264
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,982
l would like to meet you.

265
00:33:46,157 --> 00:33:49,888
- Would you mind just going away?
- What?

266
00:33:50,094 --> 00:33:54,724
Don't be hurt. l want to be by myself,
you know?

267
00:33:55,299 --> 00:33:58,291
- l saw you at 2001 .
- So?

268
00:33:58,536 --> 00:34:01,300
You looked at me and l looked at you.

269
00:34:01,539 --> 00:34:06,704
l look at a guy for a millionth of a second
and he gets delusions of grandeur!

270
00:34:06,911 --> 00:34:12,144
- l'm going to tell you what you are.
- l bet it begins with a ''C'', Mr P.

271
00:34:12,350 --> 00:34:15,547
Fine, fine. That's...

272
00:34:15,753 --> 00:34:19,086
l know the type. Fine.

273
00:34:27,265 --> 00:34:33,465
Why are you up so late? What is this?
Don't you have any criticism of me?

274
00:34:34,605 --> 00:34:38,097
- Your brother's upstairs.
- You're kidding!

275
00:34:38,309 --> 00:34:42,905
- Frankie! How are you doing?
- How are you, kid?

276
00:34:44,849 --> 00:34:48,046
- lt's good to see you.
- You, too.

277
00:34:48,219 --> 00:34:52,155
- You look good.
- No, l don't. You look wonderful.

278
00:34:52,356 --> 00:34:57,658
- Checking out my trophy?
- That's you? First prize.

279
00:34:57,862 --> 00:35:01,457
- Looks just like you.
- What did you say to them?

280
00:35:01,666 --> 00:35:05,124
They look like zombies,
like somebody died!

281
00:35:05,336 --> 00:35:10,933
- l think they're in shock, Tony.
- Why would they be in shock?

282
00:35:11,142 --> 00:35:17,342
- l'm leaving the Church.
- Yeah, sure. Leaving the Church.

283
00:35:18,149 --> 00:35:22,381
- Tell me another one.
- l'm leaving the priesthood.

284
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:25,453
Frank, don't fool around like that.

285
00:35:25,656 --> 00:35:30,821
Do you think l'm losing my hair?
lt looks very thin right here and here.

286
00:35:32,563 --> 00:35:34,622
Are you serious?

287
00:35:34,832 --> 00:35:39,997
Can l borrow your clothes until l buy
some? l don't want to wear the uniform.

288
00:35:40,905 --> 00:35:45,740
- l'm really sorry, Frank.
- What are you sorry about?

289
00:35:45,943 --> 00:35:50,209
- You got fired, right?
- No, l quit.

290
00:35:50,414 --> 00:35:54,544
- You quit?
- Yeah, you can, you know?

291
00:36:03,361 --> 00:36:06,728
Well, what did Mom say about it?

292
00:36:06,931 --> 00:36:11,425
''Dear Lord, what am l going to tell
Theresa and Marie?''

293
00:36:11,669 --> 00:36:17,039
- What did Dad say?
- They're ashamed. Both of them.

294
00:36:18,876 --> 00:36:21,845
Are you ashamed of me, Tony?

295
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,507
Yeah.

296
00:36:25,383 --> 00:36:28,443
- Didn't they ask why?
- No.

297
00:36:28,686 --> 00:36:33,646
l think they're afraid to.
Like l might say, ''Celibacy''.

298
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:37,921
But...

299
00:36:44,302 --> 00:36:47,669
Are you going to sleep here tonight?
ln my room?

300
00:36:47,838 --> 00:36:53,606
- Yeah, l thought l would.
- All right, l'll get blankets for you.

301
00:37:12,763 --> 00:37:16,221
Frank, how come you left, really?

302
00:37:19,003 --> 00:37:23,133
lt's not easy to explain, Anthony.
A lot of things.

303
00:37:23,608 --> 00:37:30,411
One day you look at a crucifix, and
all you see is a man dying on a cross.

304
00:37:31,882 --> 00:37:35,318
But that's only a backdrop
to something else.

305
00:37:35,886 --> 00:37:39,982
Mama and Papa,
their dreams of pious glory.

306
00:37:40,558 --> 00:37:44,824
They turn you into what they wish
at the time.

307
00:37:45,029 --> 00:37:48,726
You can't defend yourself
against their fantasies.

308
00:37:48,899 --> 00:37:55,031
All l ever really had any belief in
was their image of me as a priest, so...

309
00:38:02,546 --> 00:38:08,007
l guess we'll have to take your picture
down from the mantle.

310
00:38:11,155 --> 00:38:17,856
You know what's weird? l always felt
l was the shit and you were perfect.

311
00:38:18,062 --> 00:38:22,999
Now that l'm the disgrace to the family,
l'm not so perfect any more.

312
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:26,294
So maybe you're not shit any more.

313
00:38:28,239 --> 00:38:32,539
Yeah, maybe if you're not so good,
then l'm not so bad.

314
00:38:32,743 --> 00:38:34,472
Yeah.

315
00:38:43,888 --> 00:38:48,018
- Give me the groceries.
- Don't take my groceries. Come on!

316
00:38:48,225 --> 00:38:52,491
- Don't eat the apple. Give it back.
- Here.

317
00:38:52,697 --> 00:38:57,031
Jesus! What's the matter with you?
What are you doing?

318
00:38:57,234 --> 00:38:59,930
My brother quit the Church.

319
00:39:00,137 --> 00:39:03,732
l feel wild. l've got all this energy!

320
00:39:03,941 --> 00:39:08,037
l'll call you tonight, all right?
See you later, Gus!

321
00:39:11,882 --> 00:39:14,680
Higher with the arms! Yeah, that's it.

322
00:39:15,219 --> 00:39:17,813
Yeah, do it to me!

323
00:39:20,091 --> 00:39:23,458
- She come in?
- l told you she comes in on Tuesday.

324
00:39:23,661 --> 00:39:26,528
- So is she here?
- What is today?

325
00:39:26,731 --> 00:39:29,461
- lt's Tuesday.
- Yeah.

326
00:39:30,267 --> 00:39:35,830
Hey, Tone! Watch it. That one's
practising to be a bitch. Come on!

327
00:40:14,178 --> 00:40:18,672
Hello, Stephanie Mangano.
l'm Tony Manero.

328
00:40:18,916 --> 00:40:21,908
We both have the same last initial.

329
00:40:22,119 --> 00:40:27,284
When we get married l don't have to
change the monogram on my luggage.

330
00:40:27,491 --> 00:40:32,656
Somebody said you're practising
to be a bitch. ls that true?

331
00:40:38,202 --> 00:40:42,832
- What do you want to ask me?
- Will you have coffee with me?

332
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:46,532
- ls that it?
- l think you're a very good dancer.

333
00:40:46,744 --> 00:40:52,410
You know that 2001 Odyssey
has a dance contest now?

334
00:40:53,217 --> 00:40:56,846
l think that we could be
a dynamite team together.

335
00:41:00,324 --> 00:41:02,315
- How old are you?
- l'm 20.

336
00:41:04,595 --> 00:41:08,725
l'm 1 9 at the moment,
but l'll be 20 very shortly.

337
00:41:08,966 --> 00:41:12,458
l think there's a world of difference
between us.

338
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:18,006
Not just chronologically, but emotionally,
culturally, physically, every way,

339
00:41:18,209 --> 00:41:23,078
and this world would get bigger
and worse with every passing week.

340
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:27,683
- What shit is that? Coffee, not sex.
- Just coffee?

341
00:41:27,885 --> 00:41:32,948
l work with very remarkable people.
They're not like Bay Ridge people.

342
00:41:33,123 --> 00:41:36,058
- Snobs instead of slobs?
- What?

343
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:40,390
Nothing. Bay Ridge isn't the worst part
of Brooklyn.

344
00:41:40,598 --> 00:41:44,728
- lt's no hellhole.
- Well, it ain't...isn't Manhattan.

345
00:41:44,935 --> 00:41:50,498
Right over there, across the river,
everything is completely different.

346
00:41:50,708 --> 00:41:55,168
lt's beautiful! People are beautiful,
offices are beautiful.

347
00:41:55,379 --> 00:41:58,974
The secretaries all shop
at Bonwit Teller.

348
00:41:59,149 --> 00:42:01,743
The lunch hours are beautiful, too.

349
00:42:01,952 --> 00:42:06,753
They'll give you two hours for lunch
to do something related.

350
00:42:06,957 --> 00:42:09,482
We saw Zeffirelli's ''Romeo and Juliet''.

351
00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:13,426
''Romeo and Juliet''?
l read that in high school.

352
00:42:13,631 --> 00:42:16,395
That's Shakespeare, right?

353
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:22,436
No, it's Zeffirelli, the director
of the movie. You know, the movie?

354
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:27,600
What l never understood
about ''Romeo and Juliet''

355
00:42:27,811 --> 00:42:30,803
is why Romeo took
the poison so quick.

356
00:42:31,048 --> 00:42:33,448
l feel like he could have waited.

357
00:42:33,651 --> 00:42:36,745
lt's the way they took poison
in those days.

358
00:42:38,455 --> 00:42:44,052
- Are you eating? Here's the menu.
- No, l'll just have tea with lemon.

359
00:42:44,828 --> 00:42:48,264
l've started drinking tea.
lt's more refined.

360
00:42:48,465 --> 00:42:50,092
Oh, yeah?

361
00:42:50,301 --> 00:42:56,069
All the women executives drink tea
with lemon. They notice that l do, too.

362
00:42:56,974 --> 00:43:00,671
- l like coffee. l drink coffee.
- Yeah.

363
00:43:03,614 --> 00:43:07,345
l've only been with this agency
a short time,

364
00:43:07,585 --> 00:43:12,181
but over there l'm functioning
in a kind of public relations capacity.

365
00:43:12,389 --> 00:43:14,823
l fill in for the agents.

366
00:43:15,025 --> 00:43:20,429
This week l had business lunches
with Eric Clapton at the Côte Basque.

367
00:43:20,631 --> 00:43:24,624
- And Cat Stevens at Le Madrigal.
- Far out!

368
00:43:24,835 --> 00:43:26,996
You heard of those restaurants?

369
00:43:27,204 --> 00:43:32,267
No, l don't know those exact
restaurants, but l know the type.

370
00:43:32,476 --> 00:43:38,938
- But you must have heard of the artists.
- No, l don't know... Not really.

371
00:43:39,850 --> 00:43:44,310
- Why did you say, ''Far out''?
- lt sounded like far out. Wasn't it?

372
00:43:44,521 --> 00:43:47,615
- Yeah.
- We'd like a lemon with some tea.

373
00:43:47,825 --> 00:43:51,727
l'd like a cheeseburger
and some coffee.

374
00:43:57,368 --> 00:44:01,395
Know who came in the office?
Laurence Olivier.

375
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:05,006
- Who's that?
- You don't know who he is?

376
00:44:06,076 --> 00:44:12,037
Laurence Olivier is the greatest actor
in the world! You know who he is.

377
00:44:12,249 --> 00:44:17,812
He's the English actor on television,
who does those Polaroid commercials.

378
00:44:18,555 --> 00:44:21,490
Oh, him! He's good. He is good.

379
00:44:21,692 --> 00:44:24,752
l did a few errands for him.

380
00:44:24,962 --> 00:44:27,396
He tells everyone in the office

381
00:44:27,598 --> 00:44:33,662
that l'm the brightest, the most
vivacious thing in the entire office!

382
00:44:33,871 --> 00:44:37,705
Could you get a camera from him
at a discount?

383
00:44:37,908 --> 00:44:43,710
- l didn't ask him about a camera!
- 'Cause you have one, you sly fox.

384
00:44:43,914 --> 00:44:47,008
- Are you enjoying what l'm telling you?
- Sure.

385
00:44:47,217 --> 00:44:52,382
Maybe you can't handle hearing about
a kind of life so different from yours.

386
00:44:52,589 --> 00:44:56,457
- You mean better?
- Yes, sure, it's better.

387
00:44:56,660 --> 00:44:57,957
Ketchup, please.

388
00:44:58,195 --> 00:45:00,789
l'm out of this Bay Ridge scene.

389
00:45:00,998 --> 00:45:04,764
l'm getting my own apartment
in Manhattan.

390
00:45:04,968 --> 00:45:11,168
l'm changing as a person. l'm growing.
Nobody knows how much l'm growing.

391
00:45:11,341 --> 00:45:14,435
Why don't you go on a diet?

392
00:45:19,149 --> 00:45:20,810
Listen. l like you.

393
00:45:21,018 --> 00:45:26,615
We could dance together, nothing more.
l don't want you coming on to me.

394
00:45:26,824 --> 00:45:30,260
- Why not?
- l don't dig guys like you any more.

395
00:45:30,461 --> 00:45:35,694
You're too young, have no class,
and you don't have your shit together.

396
00:45:35,866 --> 00:45:42,135
lt's easy to get your shit together.
Take a salad bowl and potato masher.

397
00:45:42,339 --> 00:45:45,775
Get your shit together.
Shall l tell you what l do?

398
00:45:45,976 --> 00:45:48,638
- lt's not necessary.
- l'll tell you.

399
00:45:48,846 --> 00:45:51,940
l work in a paint store, and l got a raise.

400
00:45:52,149 --> 00:45:55,312
Right, and you probably
live with your family,

401
00:45:55,519 --> 00:46:00,286
hang out with your buddies, and
Saturday nights you blow it all at 2001 .

402
00:46:00,491 --> 00:46:04,928
You're a cliché. You're nowhere,
on your way to no place.

403
00:46:08,499 --> 00:46:12,492
- Do you have a stairway to the stars?
- Maybe.

404
00:46:12,703 --> 00:46:15,968
l'm taking a course,
and next semester l'll take two.

405
00:46:16,173 --> 00:46:18,937
- You didn't go to college, did you?
- No.

406
00:46:19,143 --> 00:46:23,136
- Did you ever think of going to college?
- No, did you?

407
00:46:23,347 --> 00:46:26,282
- Not back then...
- Then why bug me about it?

408
00:46:26,483 --> 00:46:30,180
Why didn't you want to go to college?
Tell me.

409
00:46:30,387 --> 00:46:32,855
Jesus Christ! l didn't!

410
00:46:37,795 --> 00:46:43,961
The high l get at 2001 is just dancing.
lt's not being a bastard or anything.

411
00:46:44,168 --> 00:46:49,902
But l'd like to get that high
someplace else in my life, you know?

412
00:46:50,107 --> 00:46:54,976
- Like where?
- l don't know where. Someplace.

413
00:46:55,179 --> 00:47:00,412
Dancing can't last forever.
lt's a short-lived kind of thing.

414
00:47:00,617 --> 00:47:03,313
But l'm getting older, you know?

415
00:47:04,955 --> 00:47:11,360
But so what? Does that mean l can't
feel that way about anything else in life?

416
00:47:11,562 --> 00:47:15,293
- ls that it?
- We have to split here.

417
00:47:15,465 --> 00:47:21,233
- No, l'll walk you the rest of the way.
- No, l'll meet you at the dance studio.

418
00:47:21,438 --> 00:47:26,102
- Stephanie, l can walk you home.
- Nothing personal, right?

419
00:47:26,343 --> 00:47:29,403
Come on, Stephanie! l can walk you.

420
00:47:31,148 --> 00:47:34,606
Jesus Christ! You know...

421
00:47:42,459 --> 00:47:45,860
- Where is he? Did you call him?
- No.

422
00:47:49,933 --> 00:47:54,370
- What's the matter?
- Gus is in hospital. The spics got him.

423
00:47:54,571 --> 00:47:56,266
- Barons?
- Barracudas.

424
00:47:56,473 --> 00:48:00,466
- That's my fucking car!
- Give me the keys.

425
00:48:00,677 --> 00:48:03,612
- You're asking for it.
- l just saw him!

426
00:48:03,814 --> 00:48:08,911
- He could have run, but that's Gus.
- Don't worry about it.

427
00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:15,115
l visited him. He has a broken nose,
ribs, leg and four teeth knocked out.

428
00:48:15,325 --> 00:48:19,625
He was carrying his groceries
and three of them jumped him.

429
00:48:19,830 --> 00:48:22,162
They spilled his groceries.

430
00:48:22,399 --> 00:48:27,234
So he said, under his breath, ''Grease-
balls, spic-dicks,'' and they got him.

431
00:48:38,815 --> 00:48:41,375
Check it out.

432
00:48:58,869 --> 00:49:00,803
Nobody in there.

433
00:49:04,841 --> 00:49:10,006
We're going to cruise around until
there's enough of them we can handle.

434
00:49:10,213 --> 00:49:13,649
- We'll pick off a couple on the street.
- That's pussy!

435
00:49:13,850 --> 00:49:18,549
- You're fucked up!
- l'm sorry, l'm sorry, l'm sorry.

436
00:49:18,755 --> 00:49:21,724
l'm sorry, l'm sorry.

437
00:49:21,959 --> 00:49:25,019
Forget it, we'll get them tomorrow.

438
00:49:28,098 --> 00:49:31,192
Dream good, jerk off better.

439
00:49:33,603 --> 00:49:37,869
- Tony, l'm getting married.
- Will you cut that shit.

440
00:49:38,075 --> 00:49:40,737
l just wanted to let you know.

441
00:49:40,978 --> 00:49:46,314
lf you get married, we'll all go with you
on your honeymoon, all right?

442
00:49:46,516 --> 00:49:49,713
- Take it easy.
- Bobby, get in the car!

443
00:49:52,756 --> 00:49:56,487
We should go to the hospital tomorrow,
you know?

444
00:49:56,693 --> 00:49:59,457
You cool off. You know?

445
00:50:00,564 --> 00:50:03,089
All right. Goodnight.

446
00:50:25,522 --> 00:50:28,787
- What did you say to Father Frank?
- What?

447
00:50:29,026 --> 00:50:31,551
- What did you say?
- Yeah?

448
00:50:31,762 --> 00:50:35,562
- What do you mean?
- You must have said something.

449
00:50:35,766 --> 00:50:39,532
You sleep in the same room,
and then he stays out all night.

450
00:50:39,736 --> 00:50:42,864
- l've said nothing.
- A priest staying out all night.

451
00:50:43,073 --> 00:50:46,440
He's not a priest now,
so he can do what he wants.

452
00:50:46,643 --> 00:50:50,773
- You said something!
- Are you trying to blame me?

453
00:50:50,981 --> 00:50:57,011
- You've been writing to him.
- You're trying to hang this on me!

454
00:50:57,187 --> 00:50:59,917
He called, he called.

455
00:51:00,123 --> 00:51:03,058
ln time, he'll see he's wrong.

456
00:51:03,260 --> 00:51:08,027
He's going through a trial of the soul.
He's going back to the Church.

457
00:51:08,198 --> 00:51:11,759
- No, he won't...
- Yes, he's going back to the Church!

458
00:51:11,968 --> 00:51:16,905
- He's going back!
- No! You don't have a priest any more.

459
00:51:17,107 --> 00:51:21,908
You've got nothing but three
shit children now! Good, good.

460
00:51:31,655 --> 00:51:34,123
l'm sorry, Mom.

461
00:51:37,661 --> 00:51:41,153
l didn't mean that. l'm sorry.

462
00:51:41,364 --> 00:51:46,563
- l love you, Mom. l really do.
- Go away. Get out of here.

463
00:51:59,483 --> 00:52:02,316
- How are you?
- OK.

464
00:52:02,519 --> 00:52:06,888
Look, Annette,
l have to tell you something.

465
00:52:07,124 --> 00:52:10,252
lt's very hard to tell you this, but...

466
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:15,625
...l changed my mind about us dancing
together. l have another partner.

467
00:52:18,702 --> 00:52:24,106
lt's professional. Things like this happen
when it's professional.

468
00:52:25,175 --> 00:52:28,235
Jesus Christ. First my mother, now you.

469
00:52:29,045 --> 00:52:33,982
Why do you hate me so much?
All l ever did was like you.

470
00:52:34,184 --> 00:52:36,652
Give me a break.

471
00:52:51,268 --> 00:52:54,328
- Hi.
- You're late.

472
00:52:54,538 --> 00:52:58,338
Only five minutes.
How long have you been here?

473
00:52:58,542 --> 00:53:03,036
- Six, seven minutes.
- Pete said you'd been here 1 5.

474
00:53:03,246 --> 00:53:05,271
Who's he?

475
00:53:05,482 --> 00:53:10,852
l've got some records. l don't know
if you like them. You like these guys?

476
00:53:11,054 --> 00:53:13,147
Yeah, super.

477
00:53:13,590 --> 00:53:16,753
You do the New York Hustle
or the Latin Hustle?

478
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:20,054
New York, Latin, l do it all.

479
00:53:48,225 --> 00:53:50,318
Follow me this time.

480
00:54:00,237 --> 00:54:07,405
- That's nice. Did you make that up?
- l saw it on TV first, then l made it up.

481
00:54:07,744 --> 00:54:13,011
- l learned one. What l do...
- Wait, let me check something out.

482
00:54:27,497 --> 00:54:30,933
- Come on.
- What are you doing?

483
00:54:37,340 --> 00:54:39,638
Stay right there.

484
00:54:48,885 --> 00:54:54,016
- Now we can dance!
- Let me show you the Latin step.

485
00:54:54,224 --> 00:54:56,749
Take your hand like this and count.

486
00:54:56,926 --> 00:54:59,394
One-two-three, two-two-three.

487
00:54:59,596 --> 00:55:02,690
Three-two-three, kick-two-three.

488
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:05,868
l've got it. lt's good.

489
00:55:12,942 --> 00:55:14,341
l like that.

490
00:55:14,544 --> 00:55:17,342
- Do you know the Tango Hustle?
- Yeah.

491
00:55:17,547 --> 00:55:19,640
Let's try that.

492
00:56:33,423 --> 00:56:37,689
- Would you like some coffee?
- No, l gotta go home.

493
00:56:40,497 --> 00:56:43,591
l like you when you're like this.

494
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:47,930
When you're quiet
and not laying all that shit on me.

495
00:56:48,705 --> 00:56:52,436
Guess who l had lunch with today?
Paul Anka.

496
00:56:52,642 --> 00:56:57,272
- l had to open my big mouth.
- lt was interesting. Very interesting.

497
00:56:57,480 --> 00:57:01,610
- A very intelligent fellow.
- You cream over that word interesting.

498
00:57:01,818 --> 00:57:07,586
- What's wrong with interesting?
- Something. Let me tell you something.

499
00:57:07,791 --> 00:57:10,760
- l think you're full of shit.
- Oh, you do?

500
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:14,259
But l don't know how much is shit
and how much is bullshit.

501
00:57:14,464 --> 00:57:18,594
When you figure it out,
let me know, all right?

502
00:57:20,336 --> 00:57:25,330
We should practise a couple of more
times. Maybe go to 2001 with a crowd.

503
00:57:25,542 --> 00:57:28,272
- Would Saturday be good?
- Maybe.

504
00:57:29,746 --> 00:57:33,512
Stephanie, l want to ask you something.

505
00:57:33,716 --> 00:57:36,810
l don't know how to say this.

506
00:57:38,888 --> 00:57:43,018
Do you think that l am
either interesting or intelligent?

507
00:57:44,461 --> 00:57:46,793
lnteresting, yeah.

508
00:57:46,996 --> 00:57:49,658
lntelligent?

509
00:57:50,834 --> 00:57:53,564
l don't know. Maybe.

510
00:57:53,770 --> 00:57:58,867
l've got to know you better. You've got
a way of seeing things a certain way.

511
00:57:59,075 --> 00:58:01,475
lnteresting, yeah.

512
00:58:01,678 --> 00:58:05,205
lntelligent? Yeah, maybe.
Maybe intelligent.

513
00:58:05,415 --> 00:58:10,045
Well, what do you know? All right!

514
00:58:10,253 --> 00:58:15,850
Stephanie, why don't we talk about
how we feel when we're dancing?

515
00:58:16,059 --> 00:58:20,826
- Goodnight and thanks.
- Could l walk you the rest of the way?

516
00:58:21,030 --> 00:58:23,055
No.

517
00:58:24,701 --> 00:58:27,727
You shouldn't have asked,
you should have just done it!

518
00:58:27,904 --> 00:58:29,201
Hot stuff. Jesus!

519
00:59:13,349 --> 00:59:17,513
- What's happening?
- This is my brother Frank.

520
00:59:31,701 --> 00:59:33,635
Our table is over there.

521
00:59:51,020 --> 00:59:55,650
You guys have a Moses effect!
The crowd parts like the Red Sea.

522
00:59:55,858 --> 00:59:58,952
- They know the Faces.
- Do you like it, Father?

523
00:59:59,162 --> 01:00:04,327
Do l look like your father? Please don't
call me that. l never could stand that.

524
01:00:04,534 --> 01:00:08,994
But, yeah, l think the place
is energising!

525
01:00:20,116 --> 01:00:21,777
Hey, Tony.

526
01:00:21,985 --> 01:00:24,112
- Hey.
- Hey.

527
01:00:24,320 --> 01:00:27,380
Are you as good in bed
as on the dance floor?

528
01:00:29,659 --> 01:00:34,289
Are you? Are you as good in bed
as you are on the dance floor?

529
01:00:34,497 --> 01:00:37,159
He never made it in a bed.

530
01:00:37,367 --> 01:00:41,497
Watch this. This isn't
my regular partner, but you'll see.

531
01:00:43,906 --> 01:00:48,036
- What are you going to have to drink?
- ''7 7''.

532
01:00:48,244 --> 01:00:50,735
Where is she?

533
01:01:05,662 --> 01:01:09,120
So, when is Connie going to get
her answer?

534
01:01:09,766 --> 01:01:11,927
- You know, Connie?
- Yeah?

535
01:01:12,168 --> 01:01:17,333
lf you're as good in bed as you are on
the dance floor, you're one lousy fuck.

536
01:01:17,540 --> 01:01:20,907
Why do they always send flowers
the next day?

537
01:01:21,110 --> 01:01:28,016
Some guys don't know a lousy fuck.
Or maybe they thought you were dead!

538
01:01:28,217 --> 01:01:30,447
Father, listen.

539
01:01:30,687 --> 01:01:37,286
My girlfriend is such a good Catholic,
she says she loves Communion wafers.

540
01:01:39,328 --> 01:01:43,025
- Mr Manero, can l talk to you?
- What's he doing?

541
01:01:45,802 --> 01:01:48,362
Forget this!

542
01:01:48,571 --> 01:01:52,564
Give the kid some room.
He's taking over again!

543
01:04:09,779 --> 01:04:13,909
- He's very good.
- He's the king out there, Father.

544
01:04:14,116 --> 01:04:17,244
- He's the best.
- He's great, he's great.

545
01:04:24,794 --> 01:04:28,457
- Can l talk to you, Father?
- Call me Frank.

546
01:04:28,664 --> 01:04:34,261
Frank, listen. Do you want
to hear something? My girlfriend...

547
01:04:34,470 --> 01:04:37,962
Can l tell you something?
Come here for a second.

548
01:04:38,174 --> 01:04:42,338
l have a lot of ideas. l was reading
about the Pope. Father!

549
01:04:42,511 --> 01:04:45,480
- Frank.
- Frank. Yeah, Frank.

550
01:04:45,681 --> 01:04:52,211
Listen, Frank. l have a girlfriend.
Her name is Pauline, and l...

551
01:04:52,421 --> 01:04:58,485
- What? Did you get her pregnant?
- Yes, l did. Yes, l did.

552
01:04:59,328 --> 01:05:02,161
She loves Communion wafers.

553
01:05:02,398 --> 01:05:07,392
l have ideas swimming around in my
head. l've been reading a lot of stuff.

554
01:05:07,603 --> 01:05:12,666
- l heard the Pope can give a special...
- ...dispensation.

555
01:05:12,909 --> 01:05:17,073
Do you think the Pope
could give Pauline an abortion?

556
01:05:17,280 --> 01:05:22,741
- A dispensation for an abortion?
- Yeah, do you think he could?

557
01:05:22,952 --> 01:05:27,013
- l don't think so, Bobby.
- Maybe he could for me.

558
01:05:27,223 --> 01:05:30,488
- Maybe?
- Sorry, Bobby. l don't think so.

559
01:05:30,693 --> 01:05:33,491
Have you talked to your priest about it?

560
01:05:33,696 --> 01:05:38,963
Yeah, l've talked to everybody about it.
l mean, l've talked to a lot of people.

561
01:05:39,168 --> 01:05:45,198
Thank you! Thanks a lot. You play,
you pay, you know? lt's funny, right?

562
01:05:47,009 --> 01:05:50,775
Don't forget, everybody.
You could win, too, man!

563
01:05:52,448 --> 01:05:55,110
Disco Universe Sweepstakes
are just a week away.

564
01:05:55,518 --> 01:05:58,612
- Do you know Stephanie Mangano?
- No.

565
01:05:58,821 --> 01:06:01,551
- l do.
- Has she come in?

566
01:06:01,757 --> 01:06:04,851
- No, not yet.
- Are you sure?

567
01:06:12,835 --> 01:06:15,929
- Tony! That was great.
- You liked it?

568
01:06:16,105 --> 01:06:18,938
- l'm going home now.
- Home?

569
01:06:19,108 --> 01:06:22,509
Stay longer. The night's just beginning.

570
01:06:22,712 --> 01:06:27,581
lt's not my scene.
You didn't expect me to stay all night?

571
01:06:27,783 --> 01:06:32,880
No, l didn't. Yes, l thought that
maybe you'd stay a little...

572
01:06:33,089 --> 01:06:35,717
- No, it's not your scene.
- l'm sorry.

573
01:06:35,925 --> 01:06:41,557
Don't worry about it. lt's nothing.
Come on, l'll walk you to the door.

574
01:06:41,764 --> 01:06:47,066
You know, your dancing
is really marvellous. lt's exciting!

575
01:06:47,269 --> 01:06:52,206
lt's exciting to watch you.
They can't keep their eyes off you.

576
01:06:52,408 --> 01:06:57,175
- l have to go now.
- Have a good night. l'll see you later.

577
01:06:57,380 --> 01:07:02,545
- Has she come in?
- You just asked me. She isn't here.

578
01:07:10,092 --> 01:07:15,086
- ls your brother OK?
- He's fine. He just had a stomach thing.

579
01:07:26,942 --> 01:07:29,103
Let's move.

580
01:07:33,349 --> 01:07:38,616
We could make it now. We aren't
practising, so we could make it.

581
01:07:38,821 --> 01:07:43,656
We make it when l decide, all right?
When l say so.

582
01:07:43,859 --> 01:07:48,023
- l'll just make it with somebody else.
- Who?

583
01:07:48,197 --> 01:07:52,827
- Somebody! Anybody here.
- Somebody here?

584
01:07:53,069 --> 01:07:56,334
- Double J, Joey...
- The fuck you will!

585
01:07:56,572 --> 01:08:02,772
Bobby, we're going to the car.
When l get back, we'll go to the bridge.

586
01:08:06,015 --> 01:08:08,540
Are you fixed?

587
01:08:10,119 --> 01:08:13,179
- Are you fixed?
- What do you mean?

588
01:08:13,389 --> 01:08:16,847
- Are you on the Pill, or what?
- No.

589
01:08:17,093 --> 01:08:18,822
No?

590
01:08:19,628 --> 01:08:24,088
- What have you got? The lOU thing?
- No.

591
01:08:25,501 --> 01:08:29,164
- No diaphragm? Nothing?
- lt doesn't matter.

592
01:08:29,371 --> 01:08:31,771
- Nothing?
- Tony, l love you.

593
01:08:31,974 --> 01:08:34,704
Are you kidding? Forget it.

594
01:08:34,910 --> 01:08:38,277
Fuck! Just give me a blow job.
Come on.

595
01:08:42,218 --> 01:08:44,277
- Just a minute.
- Hey, Tony!

596
01:08:44,487 --> 01:08:50,653
Forget it. Fix yourself up. Everything
was cool, you had a good time.

597
01:09:04,140 --> 01:09:06,836
Annette, cigarette?

598
01:09:08,511 --> 01:09:09,637
Guess not.

599
01:09:48,884 --> 01:09:50,442
Stupid screw-offs!

600
01:10:04,700 --> 01:10:09,069
Annette, can you dig it?
l knew that you could.

601
01:10:17,613 --> 01:10:20,207
- Joey!
- Fuck, Double J !

602
01:10:20,983 --> 01:10:27,411
Tony! Let's get the motherfuck down!
Let's push him off!

603
01:10:27,623 --> 01:10:32,117
- You're going in, you big fucking hunk!
- `sto cazzo, man!

604
01:10:32,995 --> 01:10:35,828
Come on, Tony! Let's get him!

605
01:10:37,666 --> 01:10:39,827
Come on, let's go.

606
01:10:40,035 --> 01:10:43,801
- Honky!
- Let's get the motherfuck off!

607
01:10:44,006 --> 01:10:46,099
Hey! Tarzan!

608
01:10:52,848 --> 01:10:54,440
Double J !

609
01:10:55,985 --> 01:10:58,078
Don't look! l'm coming!

610
01:11:03,659 --> 01:11:05,092
You fuckers!

611
01:11:05,294 --> 01:11:09,253
- Can you dig it?
- l knew that you could!

612
01:11:11,500 --> 01:11:13,968
You stupid bitch.

613
01:11:25,981 --> 01:11:27,676
l wish you were staying longer.

614
01:11:27,883 --> 01:11:32,684
Ex-priests don't stay back home.
Everyone's too disgraced.

615
01:11:32,888 --> 01:11:38,053
When a family raises a priest, they think
they've scored points in heaven.

616
01:11:38,294 --> 01:11:42,663
We'd better get going. l have
to pick up some people on the way.

617
01:11:42,865 --> 01:11:47,632
- We have to keep in touch.
- Will you like this settlement house?

618
01:11:47,836 --> 01:11:50,134
lt'll do until l figure out my next move.

619
01:11:50,339 --> 01:11:52,307
- And you?
- What?

620
01:11:52,508 --> 01:11:58,037
- What will you do about the dancing?
- People ask me all the time.

621
01:11:58,247 --> 01:12:02,684
All my life l've been told
l'm the no-good in the family.

622
01:12:02,885 --> 01:12:07,481
The only way you'll survive is
to do what you think is right.

623
01:12:07,690 --> 01:12:13,890
Not what they try to jam you into.
lf you do that, you'll end up miserable.

624
01:12:20,436 --> 01:12:23,234
Have a good trip.

625
01:12:24,740 --> 01:12:28,301
- l left you something in your room.
- What?

626
01:12:28,477 --> 01:12:32,004
- A souvenir.
- Money?

627
01:12:33,882 --> 01:12:35,907
Leave money!

628
01:13:13,489 --> 01:13:19,291
- Hi! Why are you standing there?
- Why didn't you come on Saturday?

629
01:13:19,495 --> 01:13:22,794
- l didn't say l would come.
- The fuck you did.

630
01:13:22,998 --> 01:13:27,765
l said maybe.
l didn't think you'd get upset about it.

631
01:13:27,970 --> 01:13:32,907
l'm not upset, but we needed
the practice. You should've been there.

632
01:13:33,108 --> 01:13:35,599
Let's practise, then.

633
01:13:37,813 --> 01:13:41,647
l didn't bring records.
l didn't think you'd be here.

634
01:13:41,850 --> 01:13:44,944
So why did you come?

635
01:13:47,723 --> 01:13:52,285
- `sto cazzo. Do you know `sto cazzo?
- Yeah, l know `sto cazzo.

636
01:13:52,494 --> 01:13:53,825
We'll use this.

637
01:13:54,029 --> 01:13:57,021
''lf you're not of your mind
to break up...''

638
01:13:58,133 --> 01:14:01,193
- What's up?
- We've been waiting, man.

639
01:14:01,437 --> 01:14:06,204
- Pete said you were practising.
- We've been cruising you-know-who.

640
01:14:06,442 --> 01:14:09,172
We'll talk about it later.

641
01:14:09,378 --> 01:14:12,905
Stephanie, this is Joey,
Double J and Bobby C.

642
01:14:13,081 --> 01:14:17,017
- How are you? Are you a dancer?
- Yeah.

643
01:14:17,219 --> 01:14:18,846
- Hungry?
- Yeah.

644
01:14:19,054 --> 01:14:21,614
Where do you want to eat?

645
01:14:23,158 --> 01:14:25,786
l'm going to change, and then...

646
01:14:26,728 --> 01:14:29,925
- What maracas!
- They're nice tits.

647
01:14:31,733 --> 01:14:35,726
l'm going on promotional tours
with authors and performers.

648
01:14:35,971 --> 01:14:40,840
l'll hate leaving Manhattan and missing
certain ballets and concerts.

649
01:14:41,043 --> 01:14:44,706
Tell them about the people
who come to the office.

650
01:14:44,913 --> 01:14:49,316
You know who came in today?
David Bowie, in an astrakhan coat.

651
01:14:49,518 --> 01:14:51,850
- He's a faggot.
- A half-faggot.

652
01:14:52,054 --> 01:14:56,184
- Relax. Let's sit down.
- You mean he's bisexual?

653
01:14:56,391 --> 01:15:01,192
Yeah, he swings both ways.
Men and boys. What's so funny?

654
01:15:01,396 --> 01:15:04,832
Joe Namath came in today.
You know him?

655
01:15:05,033 --> 01:15:10,198
He wanted some coffee, so l brought
him some, and he asked me to join him.

656
01:15:10,405 --> 01:15:13,897
- Joe Namath?
- Yeah. We were talking a little.

657
01:15:14,109 --> 01:15:19,274
He asked what it was like to be 21 .
l said l didn't know, because l'm just 20.

658
01:15:19,515 --> 01:15:22,075
- What else?
- That's all.

659
01:15:22,284 --> 01:15:25,685
- lsn't that enough?
- Don't you ever chew, Tony?

660
01:15:25,888 --> 01:15:31,053
- When my mother dies, you get the job.
- Your throat is full of hamburger.

661
01:15:31,260 --> 01:15:36,425
Big gobs, like dog food. Dog Friskies,
Yummies. He's going to turn into a dog!

662
01:15:52,414 --> 01:15:54,939
Stephanie, can l talk to you?

663
01:15:55,150 --> 01:16:01,214
You seem to know a lot of people
and a lot of places and things.

664
01:16:01,423 --> 01:16:07,328
l have a friend. He's a very good friend,
and he got a girl pregnant.

665
01:16:07,563 --> 01:16:14,969
lf you had to choose between abortion
and marriage, what would you do?

666
01:16:15,170 --> 01:16:18,401
Who would l have to marry?

667
01:16:18,607 --> 01:16:21,770
You'd have to marry me.

668
01:16:21,977 --> 01:16:27,074
- l'd get an abortion. So long, Tony!
- lt was very nice meeting you.

669
01:16:27,649 --> 01:16:31,779
- What did you think of her?
- l thought she was nice.

670
01:16:31,987 --> 01:16:37,152
- She's a snotty bitch.
- She's cool when you get to know her.

671
01:16:37,359 --> 01:16:40,294
- Did you fuck her yet?
- What do you think?

672
01:16:40,495 --> 01:16:44,761
- l don't think so.
- You guys need to grow up.

673
01:16:44,967 --> 01:16:46,992
You're babies.

674
01:16:50,806 --> 01:16:52,774
l need the afternoon off.

675
01:16:52,975 --> 01:16:55,705
Sam's out, Harold's sick. Take these.

676
01:16:55,911 --> 01:16:58,675
- But l have to.
- Sorry, Tony.

677
01:16:58,880 --> 01:17:03,112
l've been here almost eight months
and haven't missed a day!

678
01:17:03,318 --> 01:17:06,378
- Not today, Tony.
- Come on, Mr Fusco!

679
01:17:06,622 --> 01:17:10,080
When those old farts miss days,
you say nothing!

680
01:17:10,258 --> 01:17:14,160
- Cool off!
- l'm taking the afternoon off.

681
01:17:14,363 --> 01:17:16,729
- Then you're fired.
- l'm doing it.

682
01:17:16,932 --> 01:17:21,232
- You're fired!
- Fuck you, asshole!

683
01:17:21,436 --> 01:17:23,097
And the horse you rode in on.

684
01:17:23,271 --> 01:17:27,799
- Cocksucker asshole!
- l don't want to marry Pauline.

685
01:17:28,010 --> 01:17:32,379
- Then don't.
- l have to! She won't have an abortion.

686
01:17:32,581 --> 01:17:35,379
- Everyone says l have to marry her.
- Who?

687
01:17:35,584 --> 01:17:39,918
Her fucking parents, my fucking
parents, the fucking priest,

688
01:17:40,155 --> 01:17:42,885
her fucking guidance counsellor.

689
01:17:43,091 --> 01:17:45,252
Tony, l'm paralysed.

690
01:17:45,460 --> 01:17:50,727
You and me have been friends
a long time. l'm hurting.

691
01:17:50,932 --> 01:17:56,871
Shit! You're always together and l'm
always fucking up. You're always OK.

692
01:17:57,072 --> 01:18:02,135
Everybody fucks up. Really!
Don't worry about anything.

693
01:18:02,310 --> 01:18:05,768
- You're great!
- l'm in a rush. l hate to leave you.

694
01:18:05,981 --> 01:18:09,542
l appreciate this.
The car is really important today.

695
01:18:09,751 --> 01:18:12,777
- Call me tonight?
- Yes. Don't worry.

696
01:18:12,988 --> 01:18:16,048
- Take care.
- Talk to you later, then?

697
01:18:16,425 --> 01:18:18,552
- You'll call tonight?
- Yeah.

698
01:18:18,760 --> 01:18:21,593
You'll call me tonight?

699
01:18:54,863 --> 01:18:58,264
- Stephanie, this got me fired.
- What?

700
01:18:58,467 --> 01:19:03,097
You couldn't do it on Sunday,
so my boss fired me.

701
01:19:03,305 --> 01:19:08,072
l wanted everything in,
so l could fix it up on Saturday.

702
01:19:08,276 --> 01:19:12,406
Nobody bitched at my office.
l got the whole day off.

703
01:19:13,615 --> 01:19:18,575
- l'm sorry.
- lt's all right. l can handle it.

704
01:20:20,549 --> 01:20:22,574
Come on in.

705
01:20:23,451 --> 01:20:26,420
Put that over here.

706
01:20:26,621 --> 01:20:30,182
- Hey!
- l thought you'd be out of town.

707
01:20:30,392 --> 01:20:32,417
l postponed the trip.

708
01:20:35,831 --> 01:20:39,927
Jay, this is my friend Tony Manero.
This is Jay Langhart.

709
01:20:40,135 --> 01:20:43,502
Unspecified status. How do you do?

710
01:20:44,139 --> 01:20:48,405
- l'm leaving you all the furniture.
- Are you kidding?

711
01:20:48,610 --> 01:20:51,511
You picked out most of it anyway.

712
01:20:51,713 --> 01:20:57,049
- Well, super.
- Nobody says super any more!

713
01:20:57,252 --> 01:21:02,849
- Can l get you a beer, a glass of wine?
- No, it's all right.

714
01:21:03,058 --> 01:21:07,324
- l read that book you told me to read.
- Kerr or Lawson?

715
01:21:07,495 --> 01:21:11,454
- Kerr.
- You should've read the Lawson.

716
01:21:11,666 --> 01:21:16,126
lf l can help you guys move in,
l'll be glad to help.

717
01:21:24,479 --> 01:21:26,606
l'll get the rest.

718
01:21:38,293 --> 01:21:42,423
- Who is that guy?
- He's an arranger, a record producer.

719
01:21:42,631 --> 01:21:47,398
He wants to do films. He's moving
to a more expensive apartment.

720
01:21:47,602 --> 01:21:49,502
l met him at the agency.

721
01:21:49,704 --> 01:21:55,006
He didn't want his wife to know what
money he had until after the divorce.

722
01:21:55,410 --> 01:21:59,506
- Come on, let's go.
- l meant, who is he to you?

723
01:22:01,650 --> 01:22:04,949
He's a friend of mine. He's a friend.

724
01:22:05,153 --> 01:22:08,247
l was living with him for a little while.

725
01:22:08,456 --> 01:22:11,755
Are you in love with him?
Tell me the story.

726
01:22:11,960 --> 01:22:18,627
No! We had a thing, it didn't work out
and it's over now, but he still likes me.

727
01:22:18,833 --> 01:22:23,099
He likes to have you around
for a quick piece.

728
01:22:23,305 --> 01:22:27,469
He helped me! lt's crazy at that place.
You don't know shit!

729
01:22:27,676 --> 01:22:33,774
l didn't know how to do stuff,
so l'd ask him and he'd tell me.

730
01:22:33,982 --> 01:22:36,348
And it would be all right.

731
01:22:36,551 --> 01:22:41,784
Otherwise l'd be like an idiot,
saying, ''l don't know.'' He helps me.

732
01:22:41,990 --> 01:22:45,221
Does he help you
get in and out of the sack?

733
01:22:45,460 --> 01:22:51,126
He helped me. What the hell do you
expect me to do? What do you expect?

734
01:22:51,333 --> 01:22:53,358
He helped me.

735
01:23:02,010 --> 01:23:07,448
Don't cry about it. All right,
so he helped you. That's good for you.

736
01:23:11,586 --> 01:23:14,487
Let's get out of here.

737
01:23:15,290 --> 01:23:17,758
l`m sorry.

738
01:23:18,126 --> 01:23:19,491
lt`s all right.

739
01:23:19,694 --> 01:23:23,255
Don`t worry about anything.
Don`t worry about that.

740
01:23:23,798 --> 01:23:25,857
Stephanie, don't.

741
01:23:26,701 --> 01:23:31,331
- We'll stop here for a while.
- No, don't stop. Just take me home.

742
01:23:31,539 --> 01:23:36,169
No, we'll just sit here for a while.
Don't worry about anything.

743
01:23:42,283 --> 01:23:44,615
lt's pretty, isn't it?

744
01:23:51,459 --> 01:23:53,518
Sit down.

745
01:24:04,806 --> 01:24:11,041
Do you know how tall that bridge is?
That tower goes up 690 feet.

746
01:24:11,246 --> 01:24:14,875
40 million cars go across a year.

747
01:24:15,083 --> 01:24:20,043
1 27,000 tons of steel is involved in that.

748
01:24:20,789 --> 01:24:26,785
lt's almost three quarters of a million
yards of concrete. That's right.

749
01:24:26,995 --> 01:24:31,591
The centre span is 4,260 feet long.

750
01:24:31,800 --> 01:24:37,136
With the on-ramps,
it all totals two and a half miles.

751
01:24:38,473 --> 01:24:41,965
You know all about the bridge,
don't you?

752
01:24:42,811 --> 01:24:45,177
l know everything about that bridge.

753
01:24:45,380 --> 01:24:49,942
Know what else?
There's a guy buried in the cement.

754
01:24:50,151 --> 01:24:52,176
Really?

755
01:24:52,387 --> 01:24:54,855
Know how it happened?

756
01:24:55,090 --> 01:25:00,494
While they were working on it,
pouring the cement,

757
01:25:00,695 --> 01:25:06,634
he slipped off on the upper part
of the bridge and, you know, fell in.

758
01:25:08,903 --> 01:25:10,928
Dumb fuck.

759
01:25:11,139 --> 01:25:14,939
- What a way to go.
- l come here a lot. l get ideas.

760
01:25:15,143 --> 01:25:18,510
What kind of ideas do you get?

761
01:25:18,713 --> 01:25:22,205
l dunno...daydreams.
l daydream a lot.

762
01:25:47,642 --> 01:25:50,702
Mr Fusco, l've come
for what l've got coming.

763
01:25:50,912 --> 01:25:55,349
- Things got hot under the collar.
- What do you mean?

764
01:25:55,550 --> 01:26:01,045
l don't want to lose you. You're a good
kid. The customers like you. Stay.

765
01:26:01,256 --> 01:26:04,714
- l'm not fired?
- No. Come on.

766
01:26:04,926 --> 01:26:08,020
- Unbelievable!
- You've got a future here.

767
01:26:08,229 --> 01:26:13,895
Harold's been here 1 8 years,
since l opened. Mike, 1 5 years!

768
01:26:14,102 --> 01:26:18,232
Give Harold a hand.
He's making a mess of it.

769
01:26:34,622 --> 01:26:36,419
What are you doing?

770
01:26:37,992 --> 01:26:41,450
- Trying to get up to 70% ?
- Whoa, man!

771
01:26:41,696 --> 01:26:45,223
l didn't know
you hung your label on her!

772
01:26:45,433 --> 01:26:49,028
That guy's the biggest cunt hound
in Bay Ridge.

773
01:26:49,237 --> 01:26:54,698
- My God, l've been in serious danger!
- lt's no joke. He's a sleazy whore.

774
01:26:56,778 --> 01:27:01,715
- l was dancing with him. Dancing.
- No, no, forget it.

775
01:27:01,916 --> 01:27:05,545
- Let's dance.
- You disgust me.

776
01:27:05,753 --> 01:27:09,883
What do you mean?
l was just dancing with the guy!

777
01:27:14,362 --> 01:27:16,421
- Tony!
- What do you want?

778
01:27:16,631 --> 01:27:18,690
Just look.

779
01:27:23,838 --> 01:27:25,203
Jesus!

780
01:28:12,887 --> 01:28:16,288
Beautiful! There are six,
seven of them and chicks.

781
01:28:16,491 --> 01:28:19,654
- Let's wait until there are three or four.
- One or two?

782
01:28:19,861 --> 01:28:22,261
- Tony!
- l'm thinking.

783
01:28:22,430 --> 01:28:24,660
- Tony...
- Shut up!

784
01:28:24,866 --> 01:28:28,962
- Back up.
- What are you doing, Double J?

785
01:28:29,170 --> 01:28:31,638
- Backing up.
- Are you crazy?

786
01:28:33,074 --> 01:28:35,804
- l'm getting married.
- Shut up!

787
01:28:37,612 --> 01:28:39,375
Come on, fuckers!

788
01:28:54,962 --> 01:28:56,520
Tony!

789
01:29:04,539 --> 01:29:08,999
- Joey!
- Tony, help me! Please, God!

790
01:29:15,717 --> 01:29:18,811
What the hell do you think you're doing?

791
01:29:50,651 --> 01:29:55,714
- Tony, come here! lt's me. Come on!
- Let's get outta here!

792
01:30:04,098 --> 01:30:06,157
He chickened! Where is he?

793
01:30:14,809 --> 01:30:17,277
Go, man, go!

794
01:30:20,314 --> 01:30:24,250
- Where the hell were you?
- l was just driving around.

795
01:30:24,452 --> 01:30:26,477
l was looking for you.

796
01:30:36,030 --> 01:30:40,262
- Did you get the number of the truck?
- Don't make me laugh.

797
01:30:40,468 --> 01:30:43,528
- Look. We don't love you, right?
- We got them.

798
01:30:43,738 --> 01:30:45,797
- Does it hurt?
- Yeah.

799
01:30:46,007 --> 01:30:51,001
- Did you really kick their asses?
- We got them, ltalian style.

800
01:30:51,212 --> 01:30:56,514
That's great. Except, you know,
l'm not so sure it was the Barracudas.

801
01:31:03,891 --> 01:31:08,351
- You said it was.
- No, l said it probably was.

802
01:31:08,563 --> 01:31:12,693
Don't pull our legs.
We can get into trouble for that.

803
01:31:12,900 --> 01:31:15,630
You said it probably was.

804
01:31:15,837 --> 01:31:19,238
Yes, but it could have been
the Spanish Barons.

805
01:31:19,474 --> 01:31:23,001
Stupid bastard!
We almost got our heads busted.

806
01:31:23,211 --> 01:31:25,873
Yeah? Not you, lover.

807
01:31:36,591 --> 01:31:42,757
- You've got some fucking pair of balls!
- l had to lay somebody out for it.

808
01:31:42,997 --> 01:31:48,264
- Are you stupid? Didn't you see them?
- lf l didn't say who, they'd gotten off!

809
01:31:48,503 --> 01:31:54,703
Fuck you, Gus! Do you know what?
l feel like breaking your broken leg!

810
01:31:54,909 --> 01:31:57,605
Oh, God, l can't believe it!

811
01:31:58,513 --> 01:32:01,971
- l could have killed him.
- You couldn't kill crab lice!

812
01:32:02,149 --> 01:32:06,279
- Do you think l'm a coward?
- What do you think you are?

813
01:32:06,521 --> 01:32:10,855
Enough of that shit!
l'm bored with it, all right?

814
01:32:23,971 --> 01:32:28,101
Hey, look at this. You're beautiful, babe!

815
01:32:28,309 --> 01:32:32,211
We've got the winners here.
Let's get a table.

816
01:32:35,082 --> 01:32:38,609
- How are you doing?
- l'm all right.

817
01:32:39,687 --> 01:32:43,646
- What happened to your face?
- l cut myself shaving.

818
01:32:44,625 --> 01:32:47,924
- With a switchblade, huh?
- Come on.

819
01:33:46,554 --> 01:33:51,582
A big hand for Shirley Charles
and Chester Bronson!

820
01:33:51,826 --> 01:33:53,623
Be cool, everybody.

821
01:33:54,362 --> 01:33:56,853
No way! No good!

822
01:33:59,433 --> 01:34:03,494
Now we have Stephanie Mangano
and Tony Manero!

823
01:34:12,013 --> 01:34:16,541
- Joey, give me another one of those.
- You've had enough.

824
01:34:16,751 --> 01:34:20,881
- All right, get high. lt's your head.
- That's right.

825
01:37:50,397 --> 01:37:53,264
Hey! Hey, be cool!

826
01:37:53,467 --> 01:37:57,699
Now we have couple number 1 5!
The Puerto Rican couple.

827
01:37:57,905 --> 01:38:01,568
María Héctor y César Rodríguez!

828
01:38:08,249 --> 01:38:11,980
- Wrong neighbourhood!
- Tony, you'll take the prize.

829
01:38:54,128 --> 01:38:57,791
- They're so fucking good.
- They're spics!

830
01:38:57,998 --> 01:39:00,694
Look at them, greasing up the floor.

831
01:39:51,885 --> 01:39:52,647
Número uno!

832
01:39:55,155 --> 01:39:58,488
- No contest!
- Bullshit. They were better than us.

833
01:39:58,692 --> 01:40:01,684
- No, they were just different.
- Bullshit.

834
01:40:01,895 --> 01:40:04,728
Folks, we have the judges' decision.

835
01:40:04,932 --> 01:40:10,199
ln third place we have Elizabeth
and Joseph Cursa. Give them a hand!

836
01:40:17,544 --> 01:40:23,608
Second prize! From Puerto Rico,
César Rodríguez and María Héctor!

837
01:40:26,053 --> 01:40:29,113
- You're doing them a favour!
- You'll take the prize.

838
01:40:31,759 --> 01:40:34,523
Don't spend it in one place.

839
01:40:35,529 --> 01:40:41,934
ln first place, the coolest, Brooklyn's
Fred Astaire, the boogie-woogie man.

840
01:40:42,136 --> 01:40:44,696
He was hot! He was right on!

841
01:40:44,905 --> 01:40:48,534
Stephanie Mangano and Tony Manero!

842
01:40:51,078 --> 01:40:53,308
We won!

843
01:40:54,481 --> 01:40:57,143
Come on. Come on!

844
01:41:16,303 --> 01:41:19,067
Come on, let's boogie!

845
01:41:29,083 --> 01:41:33,179
- You put them down!
- You phoney bastards!

846
01:41:33,387 --> 01:41:39,951
You know who should have won.
My friends can't be straight with me!

847
01:41:40,160 --> 01:41:42,822
- Up your ass!
- We won it.

848
01:41:43,030 --> 01:41:48,263
lt was rigged. That's like family.
They can't give it to a spic, a stranger!

849
01:41:48,469 --> 01:41:52,963
- We were just as good, and l know it.
- You think so?

850
01:41:58,245 --> 01:42:00,304
Come with me.

851
01:42:00,514 --> 01:42:01,947
Excuse me.

852
01:42:02,149 --> 01:42:07,951
Congratulations. l'd like to give you this,
because l think you deserve it.

853
01:42:09,990 --> 01:42:13,482
- lf the spics are good, they deserve it.
- But we won!

854
01:42:13,694 --> 01:42:16,390
This is a fucking shithole!

855
01:42:16,630 --> 01:42:21,590
The assholes l hang out with.
l can't believe them sometimes.

856
01:42:21,768 --> 01:42:27,400
Everybody has to dump on somebody!
Nobody can do it straight, right?

857
01:42:27,641 --> 01:42:32,169
My pa gets dumped on at work,
so he dumps on my mother.

858
01:42:32,379 --> 01:42:35,610
The spics dump on us,
so we have to dump on them.

859
01:42:35,782 --> 01:42:40,981
Everybody's dumping on everybody.
Even the humping is dumping.

860
01:42:41,188 --> 01:42:47,127
- All right, tell me what's wrong.
- Get in. Get in!

861
01:42:54,968 --> 01:42:58,062
What the hell is wrong with you?

862
01:43:04,211 --> 01:43:06,372
Stop it!

863
01:43:06,580 --> 01:43:11,279
- Leave me alone. Get away!
- You're such a fucking cockteaser.

864
01:43:11,485 --> 01:43:15,421
- Don't call me that!
- Why do you hang around with me?

865
01:43:15,622 --> 01:43:18,090
- Dancing.
- Dancing? Why else?

866
01:43:18,292 --> 01:43:23,355
You want to know? lt's bullshit!
l've been dumping my bullshit on you.

867
01:43:23,564 --> 01:43:28,558
Selling my act on you. Making
you think l love you. lt's all bullshit!

868
01:43:28,769 --> 01:43:33,229
- You fucking cunt!
- You stop it! Don't!

869
01:43:34,942 --> 01:43:36,967
Get off me!

870
01:43:37,744 --> 01:43:39,769
Oh, Stephanie.

871
01:43:55,796 --> 01:44:00,790
- l'm mad at you, Tony.
- Annette's giving everybody snatch pie!

872
01:44:01,768 --> 01:44:05,204
- The fuck you are.
- What are you doing?

873
01:44:05,372 --> 01:44:09,502
What is with you? And you, you punk?
You little fuck!

874
01:44:09,743 --> 01:44:12,803
- What is it?
- You don't give a shit about her!

875
01:44:15,549 --> 01:44:18,109
Annette, get in the car.

876
01:44:26,360 --> 01:44:28,794
Go on. Do it.

877
01:44:34,201 --> 01:44:38,001
l told you.
You can fuck all night on speed.

878
01:44:38,205 --> 01:44:43,040
- Joey, what are you doing?
- The first is always the best.

879
01:45:05,032 --> 01:45:08,126

01:45:18,845 --> 01:45:21,143
l don't want to do it.

883
01:45:26,420 --> 01:45:28,854
Fuck!

884
01:45:30,757 --> 01:45:32,816
Shit! With me she cries.

885
01:45:33,026 --> 01:45:37,156
- Goddamn, Annette.
- No, don't. No, no.

886
01:45:48,742 --> 01:45:50,073

01:45:56,283 --> 01:45:57,944

- Anita says mine is the biggest in town.

894
01:46:33,487 --> 01:46:35,978
Are you proud of yourself, Annette?

895
01:46:36,189 --> 01:46:39,716
ls that what you wanted? Good.

896
01:46:41,328 --> 01:46:44,126
Now you're a cunt.

897
01:46:46,032 --> 01:46:48,592
What are you doing?

898
01:46:50,036 --> 01:46:52,504
Where are you going?

899
01:47:04,684 --> 01:47:07,380
Come on, Annette. l'm sorry.

900
01:47:08,488 --> 01:47:12,618
- l said l'm sorry.
- l didn't want to do it.

901
01:47:14,227 --> 01:47:19,130
- Look at this guy! Bobby, you punk!
- Tony!

902
01:47:19,833 --> 01:47:24,099
- Look at me!
- Bobby, get down! lt's too dangerous.

903
01:47:24,304 --> 01:47:26,772
Look at me, Tony!

904
01:47:27,974 --> 01:47:30,909
Look at me! Hey, Tony!

905
01:47:32,946 --> 01:47:37,349
- l'm not kidding. Get down from there.
- l'm all right.

906
01:47:38,718 --> 01:47:42,848
l'm all right, Tony. l'm all right.
Watch me.

907
01:47:50,397 --> 01:47:53,924
- Tony, look at me.
- Now you're being crazy.

908
01:47:54,100 --> 01:47:57,331
- Look at me. l'm doing it!
- lt's dangerous.

909
01:47:57,537 --> 01:47:59,164
Look at me!

910
01:48:00,674 --> 01:48:02,699
Oh, Jesus.

911
01:48:09,349 --> 01:48:13,080
Give me your hand. Come back in.

912
01:48:16,590 --> 01:48:20,185
- Watch!
- Don't! You're making me nervous.

913
01:48:20,393 --> 01:48:22,452
Don't do that.

914
01:48:22,629 --> 01:48:26,087
Get over here right now. l mean it!

915
01:48:28,001 --> 01:48:30,333
Jesus, no!

916
01:48:31,905 --> 01:48:33,736
- l did it.

917
01:48:33,940 --> 01:48:37,535
- l did it.
- What?

918
01:48:41,314 --> 01:48:44,545
Get over here right now. Come on.

919
01:48:44,751 --> 01:48:49,779
- Don't be upset. We'll talk in the car.
- You didn't talk to me before.

920
01:48:51,625 --> 01:48:55,061
How come you never called me?

921
01:48:56,930 --> 01:49:01,060
- l didn't want to fuck up.
- You didn't. We'll talk.

922
01:49:01,268 --> 01:49:03,930
l didn't want to fuck up this time.

923
01:49:37,437 --> 01:49:41,339
Any of you think
maybe he killed himself?

924
01:49:46,112 --> 01:49:50,481
There are ways of killing yourself
without killing yourself.

925
01:49:50,684 --> 01:49:52,948
You can go now.

926
01:49:58,625 --> 01:50:02,755
Forget the number, Chief.
We won't find anything tonight.

927
01:50:05,599 --> 01:50:06,998
Shit.

928
01:50:20,513 --> 01:50:21,571
Tone?

929
01:50:23,316 --> 01:50:25,511
Hey, Tony!

930
01:52:32,178 --> 01:52:34,510
Stephanie?

931
01:52:36,516 --> 01:52:38,711
- ls that you?
- Yeah, it's me.

932
01:52:38,885 --> 01:52:42,480
- l'm really sorry about last night.
- You're sorry?

933
01:52:42,689 --> 01:52:47,422
Yeah, l'm sorry.
lt won't happen again, l promise.

934
01:52:47,627 --> 01:52:52,326
- l really need to talk to you.
- What do you mean by that?

935
01:52:52,532 --> 01:52:55,626
Just like l said, l need to talk to you.

936
01:52:57,403 --> 01:53:01,772
lf l open the door,
you won't pull anything on me, right?

937
01:53:01,975 --> 01:53:04,500
No, of course not.

938
01:53:14,687 --> 01:53:17,656
First time l've let a rapist in.

939
01:53:17,857 --> 01:53:24,057
l'll just stay right here. That way
you don't think l'm going to jump you.

940
01:53:28,001 --> 01:53:30,902
What's wrong with you?

941
01:53:34,340 --> 01:53:37,138
Nothing. l'll tell you later.

942
01:53:38,611 --> 01:53:42,775
You can't just stand there.
This is ridiculous. Come on.

943
01:53:45,718 --> 01:53:51,918
l've been up all night, walking around.
l'm going to get myself my own place.

944
01:53:52,125 --> 01:53:55,219
l'm getting my money and coming back.

945
01:53:55,428 --> 01:53:59,330
Why don't you sit down? Come on.

946
01:54:03,069 --> 01:54:07,938
- So what are you doing?
- l'm not going back there.

947
01:54:08,141 --> 01:54:13,340
- They're assholes. l'm fed up with it.
- OK. What are you going to do?

948
01:54:13,546 --> 01:54:17,676
You get a job. Do what you do.
Get a nice apartment.

949
01:54:17,884 --> 01:54:20,751
OK. What kind of job?

950
01:54:21,721 --> 01:54:25,851
l don't know. What did you do?
You couldn't do anything.

951
01:54:26,059 --> 01:54:28,857
l could type.

952
01:54:30,263 --> 01:54:33,562
l'm an able person.
l can do these things.

953
01:54:33,766 --> 01:54:35,597
Of course you can.

954
01:54:38,238 --> 01:54:40,968
Tony, l want to tell you something.

955
01:54:41,174 --> 01:54:45,770
You know, l said all that stuff
to you about...

956
01:54:45,979 --> 01:54:49,710
...using you, practising my act on you.

957
01:54:49,916 --> 01:54:54,751
lt wasn't true. There were other reasons
why l was hanging around you.

958
01:54:54,954 --> 01:54:59,584
- What do you mean?
- You made me feel better.

959
01:54:59,792 --> 01:55:04,786
You gave me admiration, you know?
Respect. Support.

960
01:55:09,936 --> 01:55:14,737
Stephanie, maybe now,
when l'm going to be in town,

961
01:55:14,941 --> 01:55:18,138
maybe we could see each other.

962
01:55:18,344 --> 01:55:24,442
l don't mean like that. l know you're
thinking l'm promoting your pussy.

963
01:55:24,651 --> 01:55:28,781
l mean like friends. Like you said:
we could help each other.

964
01:55:29,689 --> 01:55:33,682
- You want to be friends?
- l'd like to be friends with you.

965
01:55:35,828 --> 01:55:37,955
Do you think you know how?

966
01:55:38,164 --> 01:55:43,329
Do you think you could be friends
with a girl? Could you stand that?

967
01:55:44,170 --> 01:55:47,264
The truth? l don't know.

968
01:55:47,974 --> 01:55:51,603
l could try. That's all l can say.

969
01:55:58,551 --> 01:56:00,781
OK.

970
01:56:00,987 --> 01:56:05,117
Let's be friends, all right?
We'll just be friends.

971
01:56:05,725 --> 01:56:07,784
All right.

972
01:56:13,967 --> 01:56:15,332
Friends, man.

973
01:58:41,881 --> 01:58:43,109
