1
00:01:12,322 --> 00:01:15,240
Well, you can tell
By the way I use my walk

2
00:01:15,325 --> 00:01:17,659
I'm a woman's man
No time to talk

3
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:19,745
Music loud
And women warm

4
00:01:19,829 --> 00:01:22,164
I've been kicked around
Since I was born

5
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:24,583
And now it's all right
It's okay

6
00:01:24,668 --> 00:01:27,002
And you may look the other way

7
00:01:27,295 --> 00:01:29,588
And we can try
To understand

8
00:01:29,673 --> 00:01:31,924
The New York Times' effect on man

9
00:01:32,008 --> 00:01:33,842
Whether you're a brother
Or whether you're a mother

10
00:01:33,968 --> 00:01:36,303
You're stayin' alive
Stayin' alive

11
00:01:36,596 --> 00:01:38,681
FeeI the city breaking
And everybody shaking

12
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:41,350
And we're stayin' alive
Stayin' alive

13
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,820
Stayin' alive

14
00:01:56,366 --> 00:01:58,117
Hiya, Tony. Two or three?

15
00:01:58,201 --> 00:02:00,661
Two. Two. Give me two. That's good.

16
00:02:01,705 --> 00:02:04,540
Well, now, I get low
And I get high

17
00:02:04,624 --> 00:02:06,542
And if I can't get either
I really try

18
00:02:06,668 --> 00:02:09,044
Got the wings of heaven
On my shoes

19
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:11,380
I'm a dancing man
And I just can't lose

20
00:02:11,506 --> 00:02:13,799
You know it's all right
It's okay

21
00:02:13,883 --> 00:02:16,135
I'll live to see another day

22
00:02:16,219 --> 00:02:18,637
We can try
To understand

23
00:02:18,722 --> 00:02:20,973
The New York Times' effect on man

24
00:02:21,057 --> 00:02:23,142
Whether you're a brother
Or whether you're a mother

25
00:02:23,226 --> 00:02:25,644
You're stayin' alive
Stayin' alive

26
00:02:25,729 --> 00:02:27,730
FeeI the city breaking
And everybody shaking

27
00:02:27,856 --> 00:02:30,190
And we're stayin' alive
Stayin' alive

28
00:02:32,736 --> 00:02:35,496
Stayin' alive

29
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:54,340
Hey, you guys do layaway?

30
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:56,759
As long as it don't turn into
a 20-year mortgage.

31
00:02:56,843 --> 00:03:00,846
All right, look, put me down for $5
for that blue shirt in the window.

32
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:03,599
- Hold it for me.
- Hey, wait for your receipt.

33
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:12,608
- I trust you.
- Please don't. Don't trust me.

34
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:16,862
Well, you can tell
By the way I use my walk

35
00:03:16,946 --> 00:03:19,573
I'm a woman's man
No time to talk

36
00:03:19,657 --> 00:03:21,575
Music loud
And women warm

37
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:23,869
I've been kicked around
Since I was born

38
00:03:23,953 --> 00:03:26,455
And now it's all right
It's okay

39
00:03:26,581 --> 00:03:28,832
And you may look the other way

40
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:31,085
We can try
To understand

41
00:03:31,169 --> 00:03:33,504
The New York Times' effect on man

42
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,547
Whether you're a brother
Or whether you're a mother

43
00:03:35,632 --> 00:03:37,966
You're stayin' alive
Stayin' alive

44
00:03:38,301 --> 00:03:40,302
FeeI the city breaking
And everybody shaking

45
00:03:40,428 --> 00:03:42,805
And we're stayin' alive
Stayin' alive

46
00:03:45,308 --> 00:03:47,944
Stayin' alive

47
00:03:57,028 --> 00:03:58,654
- What did he charge you?
- $7.98.

48
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,406
That bastard.
Wait till he runs out of something.

49
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:02,074
Listen, you know what to tell her.

50
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:04,410
Excuse me, ma'am, I gotta get by.

51
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:05,828
- Got a second?
- Just a minute.

52
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:07,996
Look what I got for you,
Carnival, gold, just like you wanted.

53
00:04:08,123 --> 00:04:10,165
Where have you been?
I've been here for a half hour.

54
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:12,334
That's all right. Look, I'm gonna
make you a deal on this paint.

55
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:13,919
- I'm very angry with you.
- That's all right.

56
00:04:14,004 --> 00:04:17,131
Look, I'm gonna make you
a nice deal on this. $1 off for you.

57
00:04:17,215 --> 00:04:19,967
$10.98 on this special gold paint.

58
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:21,802
- How you like that?
Thank you.

59
00:04:21,886 --> 00:04:23,554
I'll take a gallon of this.
- All right.

60
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,556
You got it. Heads up.

61
00:04:27,976 --> 00:04:29,351
That's all right.

62
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:32,563
Customers like that,
it gives them a sense of power.

63
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:34,773
I need some brushes.

64
00:04:34,858 --> 00:04:36,900
All right, how much painting
you planning to do?

65
00:04:37,027 --> 00:04:40,446
After these two rooms,
I wouldn't paint my wife's ass purple.

66
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:42,197
What color is it now?

67
00:04:42,323 --> 00:04:44,033
You wanna know
what color my wife's ass is?

68
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:45,909
You brung it up.

69
00:04:46,036 --> 00:04:50,414
Actually, it ain't got no color,
just stripes, them stretch stripes.

70
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:51,874
What about them brushes?

71
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,377
Right. See that second display counter?
Over there.

72
00:05:01,885 --> 00:05:05,679
- Hey, Mr. Fusco, can I get an advance?
- Payday's Monday.

73
00:05:05,764 --> 00:05:07,598
I know payday is Monday,

74
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:09,808
but every place else
is Friday or Saturday.

75
00:05:09,893 --> 00:05:11,477
And they're broke on Monday.

76
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:13,562
- Boozing, whoring...
- Oh, come off it.

77
00:05:13,688 --> 00:05:15,731
Pissing away their money all weekend.

78
00:05:15,857 --> 00:05:18,776
This way, you're paid on a Monday,
you got money all week.

79
00:05:18,902 --> 00:05:22,446
- You can save a little, build a future.
- Oh, fuck the future.

80
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:28,077
No, Tony, you can't fuck the future,
the future fucks you.

81
00:05:28,203 --> 00:05:32,373
It catches up with you, and it fucks you
if you ain't planned for it.

82
00:05:32,457 --> 00:05:35,084
Look, tonight is the future,
and I am planning for it.

83
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:37,044
There's a shirt I gotta buy,
a beautiful shirt. Blue...

84
00:05:37,128 --> 00:05:39,421
Sorry, Tony, no exceptions.

85
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,301
Just wait till you need an advance,
all right?

86
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:45,761
Big shot.

87
00:05:46,513 --> 00:05:48,097
Life going nowhere

88
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:49,431
Hey, come on.

89
00:05:49,808 --> 00:05:51,141
Somebody help me

90
00:05:51,976 --> 00:05:53,310
Somebody help me
Yeah

91
00:05:53,436 --> 00:05:54,937
Thanks, Tony.

92
00:05:58,441 --> 00:06:00,442
Life going nowhere

93
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:03,487
Somebody help me
Yeah

94
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:08,617
I'm stayin' alive

95
00:06:08,702 --> 00:06:10,327
Where you been?

96
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:15,457
Your mother wants to know
where you been.

97
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:19,253
Where you been?

98
00:06:19,337 --> 00:06:22,256
Your father's asking you!
Where you been?

99
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:25,551
Dinner's gonna be late tonight,
they was out of things at the market.

100
00:06:25,635 --> 00:06:27,636
But you'd have been late
if it was normal.

101
00:06:27,721 --> 00:06:30,431
- Hey, Tony.
- Hey, hot stuff. Give me a kiss.

102
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:33,892
- Look what I made for you. Here.
- Oh, that is beautiful.

103
00:06:33,977 --> 00:06:35,019
- You like it?
- Yeah.

104
00:06:35,145 --> 00:06:36,186
You'll put it in your room?

105
00:06:36,312 --> 00:06:37,438
Yeah, I'll put it in my room right now,
how's that?

106
00:06:37,522 --> 00:06:38,564
- Okay.
- All right.

107
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:43,485
Night fever
Night fever

108
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:45,988
We know how to do it

109
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:52,286
Give me that night fever
Night fever

110
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:54,496
We know how to show it

111
00:06:57,834 --> 00:07:03,172
Here I am
Praying for this moment to last

112
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:07,718
Living on the music so fine

113
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:09,887
Borne on the wind

114
00:07:10,013 --> 00:07:15,434
Making it mine

115
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:18,771
Night fever
Night fever

116
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:21,357
We know how to do it

117
00:07:23,777 --> 00:07:27,529
Give me that night fever
Night fever

118
00:07:27,614 --> 00:07:30,574
We know how to show it

119
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:37,373
And that sweet city woman
She moves through the light

120
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:40,376
Controlling my mind and my soul

121
00:07:42,212 --> 00:07:45,881
When you reach out for me, yeah
And the feeling is bright

122
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:49,677
Then I get night fever
Night fever

123
00:07:49,761 --> 00:07:51,845
We know how to do it

124
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:54,890
- Dinner's on the table.
- I ain't hungry.

125
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:57,643
Hey, just because
you're kicking in for food,

126
00:07:57,727 --> 00:07:59,103
don't mean you don't gotta eat.

127
00:07:59,187 --> 00:08:00,729
You still gotta eat.

128
00:08:00,814 --> 00:08:03,232
- I got my shirt on, all right?
- So?

129
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:05,734
So, I don't want to get anything on it,
that's what.

130
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:07,611
You got nothing to be afraid of.

131
00:08:07,696 --> 00:08:10,030
Your mother's spaghetti sauce
don't drip.

132
00:08:10,115 --> 00:08:12,658
It don't taste and it don't drip.

133
00:08:13,785 --> 00:08:15,119
Let's go.

134
00:08:16,246 --> 00:08:21,417
Making it mine

135
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:25,170
Night fever
Night fever

136
00:08:25,255 --> 00:08:27,047
How come every day
it's the same thing?

137
00:08:27,132 --> 00:08:29,216
I come home,
you tell me I'm late for dinner

138
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:32,845
when you know that I gotta work till 6:00
and I can't make dinner on time.

139
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:34,555
You should've been a priest,
like your brother,

140
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:37,057
you wouldn't worry about a job.

141
00:08:37,809 --> 00:08:39,018
Yeah.

142
00:08:39,728 --> 00:08:41,979
Every time you mention Frank, Jr.,
you gotta cross yourself?

143
00:08:42,063 --> 00:08:46,025
He's a priest, ain't he?
Father Frank, Jr., your brother.

144
00:08:46,109 --> 00:08:49,361
Your mother doesn't have much
to cross herself about these days.

145
00:08:49,446 --> 00:08:51,030
You're so jealous of Frank, Jr.

146
00:08:51,114 --> 00:08:53,282
- Oh, shut up, will you?
Hey!

147
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:57,786
- What are you doing?
- Hey, the shirt! Watch the shirt, stupid.

148
00:08:57,871 --> 00:08:59,580
All right. Come on.

149
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:01,790
- Mangia, mangia.
- Yeah, go ahead. Eat, eat.

150
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:03,959
I got more pork chops, more spaghetti.

151
00:09:04,044 --> 00:09:06,420
What do you mean, you got
more pork chops? I'm out of work.

152
00:09:06,504 --> 00:09:08,672
Yeah, well, as long as we got $1 left,
we eat good in this house.

153
00:09:08,757 --> 00:09:10,549
- What?
- Yeah, I might even get a job myself.

154
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:12,509
Like hell, you will.

155
00:09:12,594 --> 00:09:16,764
Twenty-five years in construction work,
I always brought home a paycheck.

156
00:09:16,848 --> 00:09:19,933
What, six, seven months
I'm out of work?

157
00:09:20,018 --> 00:09:21,435
Then, all of a sudden, what?

158
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:23,937
- You're hitting me and talking back.
- All right, all right.

159
00:09:24,022 --> 00:09:25,189
Talking about getting a job
and hitting me.

160
00:09:25,273 --> 00:09:27,775
All right, all right. No hitting,
no slapping at the dinner table. Okay?

161
00:09:27,859 --> 00:09:31,403
That's the rule.
And you was the one that was hitting.

162
00:09:31,488 --> 00:09:33,906
You never hit me before. Never.

163
00:09:34,449 --> 00:09:36,575
Not in front of the kids.

164
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:46,001
- One pork chop! One!
- Hey, Frank!

165
00:09:46,086 --> 00:09:48,545
It's disgusting, Ma. He's sick.

166
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:51,173
Will you just watch the hair?

167
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:55,052
You know, I work on my hair a long time
and you hit it.

168
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:56,804
He hits my hair.

169
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:02,309
Take care of his hair.
I'm gonna take a walk.

170
00:10:07,357 --> 00:10:09,858
Tony, you walk me to church later?

171
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:11,443
Didn't you go already today?

172
00:10:11,528 --> 00:10:13,821
Yeah, confession.
I gotta go back and pray for something.

173
00:10:13,905 --> 00:10:15,239
For what?

174
00:10:16,366 --> 00:10:18,867
I gotta pray
for Father Frank, Jr. to call me.

175
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:20,285
Why don't you call him direct?

176
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:22,996
I want him to call me.
A son should call his mother.

177
00:10:23,081 --> 00:10:27,543
Wait a minute. You're going to church
to have God make Frank, Jr. call you?

178
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:29,920
- Right.
- I don't believe it.

179
00:10:30,964 --> 00:10:34,008
You know, you're turning God
into a telephone operator.

180
00:10:52,027 --> 00:10:53,944
Go, go, now!

181
00:10:54,029 --> 00:10:56,989
Hey, you scumbags! Get back here!

182
00:10:57,991 --> 00:11:00,576
- Assholes.
- Come on, fuckhead!

183
00:11:01,119 --> 00:11:03,579
Hey, the stubborn fuck won't budge.

184
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:24,516
- Will you put two hands on the wheel?
- I got two hands on the wheel!

185
00:11:24,601 --> 00:11:26,810
Hey, you know, you assholes
almost broke my pussy finger.

186
00:11:26,895 --> 00:11:29,480
Oh, yeah, you wouldn't know
which one it was.

187
00:11:29,564 --> 00:11:30,647
Hey, get some of this, will you?

188
00:11:30,732 --> 00:11:31,982
Hey, Gus, tell them what we got.

189
00:11:32,067 --> 00:11:34,151
Oh, yeah, we got some ups,
we got some downs,

190
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:36,570
three ludes, two Js,
and a half a bottle of vodka.

191
00:11:36,654 --> 00:11:37,946
All right, yeah, yeah!

192
00:11:38,031 --> 00:11:41,450
That's what you got, huh?
I bet I'd get a bigger high from a fart.

193
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:42,993
You want something?
- No.

194
00:11:43,078 --> 00:11:45,621
We ain't dropping nothing till I say so.

195
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:47,790
Oh, come on. Why the fuck not?
- Hey, bullshit.

196
00:11:47,874 --> 00:11:49,625
I got my reasons, all right?
I got my reasons.

197
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:51,627
Oh, fuck, Tony.
What's wrong with you, man?

198
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:52,920
Hey, give me the vodka.

199
00:11:53,004 --> 00:11:55,464
Hey, when're you gonna get new tapes?
These things are four years old.

200
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:57,383
I bought them in the bargain basement.

201
00:11:57,467 --> 00:11:59,843
You don't like my tapes?
I'll get new tapes.

202
00:12:09,229 --> 00:12:13,107
Someone mad is going wild

203
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:18,445
And look, uh-oh
It's a one-man style

204
00:12:23,076 --> 00:12:26,453
Doctor Disco

205
00:12:32,544 --> 00:12:34,503
Hey, looking sharp, huh?

206
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:36,505
Sharp as you can look
without turning into a nigger.

207
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:38,424
- Or a spic.
- Spic, spic.

208
00:12:38,508 --> 00:12:39,925
Would you put your dick in a spic?

209
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:42,094
- Does it get bigger in a nigger?
- I don't know.

210
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:43,387
I gotta score tonight, man.

211
00:12:43,471 --> 00:12:45,347
I'm horny, you know what I mean?
Horny.

212
00:12:45,432 --> 00:12:47,933
Yeah, man, I know what you mean.
Horny, right? Horny!

213
00:12:48,018 --> 00:12:50,060
Hey, anybody scores,
you get in the car for 10 minutes,

214
00:12:50,145 --> 00:12:51,603
and you're out for the next guy, all right?

215
00:12:51,688 --> 00:12:53,522
If you get five, you get
a medal of honor with rubies,

216
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:54,690
and a piece of the Pope's ass.

217
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:55,858
What are you talking about, man?

218
00:12:55,942 --> 00:12:57,443
The Pope don't got no ass,
that's why he's the Pope.

219
00:12:57,527 --> 00:12:59,862
Now, shape up, you assholes.
We're the faces.

220
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:36,899
Tony, how's it going? All right?

221
00:13:55,043 --> 00:13:56,794
Hey, Moe!

222
00:14:10,392 --> 00:14:14,019
Hey, Tony, you seen Pauline
around here at all?

223
00:14:14,104 --> 00:14:15,479
No, we ain't seen Pauline.

224
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:17,815
Joey, you seen Pauline?

225
00:14:17,899 --> 00:14:20,275
Hl. What would you like?

226
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:23,570
- Oh, give me a Seven and Seven.
- Yeah, I'll take a beer.

227
00:14:23,655 --> 00:14:24,947
Hey, I'd like a vodka and tonic.

228
00:14:25,031 --> 00:14:27,783
You guys wanna go see the Knicks
on Tuesday? Anybody?

229
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:30,327
- Give me a...
- Wanna see the Knicks?

230
00:14:46,428 --> 00:14:47,761
Tony.

231
00:14:49,055 --> 00:14:51,724
- Yeah.
- What do you mean, <<yeah>>?

232
00:14:51,808 --> 00:14:53,308
Well, I mean, I could dance with you,

233
00:14:53,393 --> 00:14:56,770
but, you know, you're not
my dream girl or nothing like that.

234
00:14:59,274 --> 00:15:01,150
You want a dream girl?

235
00:15:01,234 --> 00:15:03,944
Well, then go to sleep
and have a nightmare.

236
00:15:05,071 --> 00:15:06,447
Hey, Gus, here's the speed.

237
00:15:06,531 --> 00:15:09,241
What are you doing? Here, take this.

238
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:12,494
Hello, again. This is beautifuI Monti,
your delicious deejay,

239
00:15:12,579 --> 00:15:14,705
reminding you about
the UniversaI Disco sweepstakes,

240
00:15:14,789 --> 00:15:17,291
so get in line to get the prize.

241
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:20,836
Oh, looks good!
Go, baby.

242
00:15:48,239 --> 00:15:55,079
A trip. A good trip.
FeeI the music, baby.

243
00:15:55,163 --> 00:15:58,248
Disco inferno
Burn, baby, burn

244
00:15:58,333 --> 00:16:00,626
Burn that mama down

245
00:16:01,378 --> 00:16:03,295
Look at that chick.
I'm gonna dance with her.

246
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:04,713
Which one?

247
00:16:05,048 --> 00:16:07,758
One hundred storeys high

248
00:16:08,385 --> 00:16:10,302
Come on, Tony! Dance!

249
00:16:11,346 --> 00:16:15,933
Getting down on the roof
Do you hear?

250
00:16:16,267 --> 00:16:22,064
Folks were screaming
Out of control

251
00:16:22,148 --> 00:16:25,693
It was so entertaining

252
00:16:25,777 --> 00:16:26,985
All right!

253
00:16:27,153 --> 00:16:32,074
When the boogie started to explode
I heard somebody say

254
00:16:32,158 --> 00:16:35,369
Disco inferno
Burn, baby, burn

255
00:16:35,453 --> 00:16:40,624
Burn that mama down

256
00:16:41,543 --> 00:16:44,628
Came in a chain reaction

257
00:16:44,713 --> 00:16:46,839
It's so beautiful in there.
I like your new haircuts.

258
00:16:46,923 --> 00:16:49,842
I like that polyester look
Turn yourself there, baby

259
00:16:53,304 --> 00:16:55,931
The heat was on

260
00:16:56,016 --> 00:16:58,726
Rising to the top

261
00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:00,477
All right!

262
00:17:01,229 --> 00:17:02,563
Yeah!

263
00:17:05,734 --> 00:17:07,443
I heard somebody say

264
00:17:07,527 --> 00:17:08,777
Hey, Tony, you know something?

265
00:17:08,862 --> 00:17:11,447
You're the king out there.
You're great. You're a great dancer.

266
00:17:11,531 --> 00:17:13,490
You could do as good as me
if you practiced.

267
00:17:13,575 --> 00:17:15,576
Yeah?
Think I'd be a good dancer, Tony?

268
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:17,578
Sure. Why not? No.

269
00:17:18,913 --> 00:17:19,997
- No?
- No.

270
00:17:20,081 --> 00:17:23,792
- Ain't you gonna ask me to sit down?
- No, you'd do it.

271
00:17:23,877 --> 00:17:27,212
- But you'd ask me to lay down.
- No, you would not do it.

272
00:17:27,297 --> 00:17:30,549
Double J, move over.
I want you to meet my friend here.

273
00:17:30,633 --> 00:17:31,717
Hey.

274
00:17:31,801 --> 00:17:33,260
Hey, Tony, listen,
you want some speed?

275
00:17:33,345 --> 00:17:36,221
It's very good stuff, Ton.
Really, it's good stuff. You want some?

276
00:17:36,306 --> 00:17:38,182
Can't you guys
get off on dancing?

277
00:17:38,266 --> 00:17:41,685
Tony, can I wipe off your forehead?

278
00:17:42,562 --> 00:17:44,605
Why not? Sure. Go ahead.

279
00:17:47,901 --> 00:17:50,694
Hey, Doreen, it ain't no blowjob.

280
00:17:50,779 --> 00:17:52,821
You don't know fuck
about women, Joey.

281
00:17:52,906 --> 00:17:54,907
You get a blowjob easier
than you get that.

282
00:17:54,991 --> 00:17:56,325
I noticed.

283
00:17:56,409 --> 00:17:58,327
I love to watch you dance, Tony.

284
00:17:58,411 --> 00:18:02,247
- Oh, yeah?
- I love it. I love to watch you dance.

285
00:18:02,332 --> 00:18:06,752
I just love it, watching you dance.

286
00:18:06,836 --> 00:18:08,337
Hey, Tony, listen, do her a favor.

287
00:18:08,421 --> 00:18:10,089
Why don't you take her
for a dance, huh?

288
00:18:10,173 --> 00:18:11,298
That's a good idea. Wanna dance?

289
00:18:11,383 --> 00:18:12,841
Would you like to dance with me?
I'd dance with you.

290
00:18:12,926 --> 00:18:14,635
It's for charity.

291
00:18:15,512 --> 00:18:18,013
Any kind of dresses
with the lace on the side.

292
00:18:18,098 --> 00:18:20,391
Weirdest chick I ever seen.

293
00:18:21,518 --> 00:18:24,561
Ton, I love to watch you dance.

294
00:18:26,856 --> 00:18:29,775
I just love it, watching you dance.

295
00:18:30,777 --> 00:18:33,404
Doreen, move up a little bit.
Come on, doll.

296
00:18:33,488 --> 00:18:36,115
She's doing a two-step with him.
Jesus Christ.

297
00:18:36,199 --> 00:18:39,118
Get your head out of his belt, there, doll.

298
00:18:39,202 --> 00:18:40,577
Oh, Jesus.

299
00:18:42,205 --> 00:18:44,540
You can't dance to this shit.

300
00:18:44,874 --> 00:18:47,543
Let's get the fuck out of here.
I paid $5 to hear this shit?

301
00:18:47,627 --> 00:18:50,462
You paid $5?
I fucking paid for you to get in.

302
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:54,258
Hey, Monti,
what are you playing that shit for?

303
00:18:54,342 --> 00:18:56,051
What are you talking about, baby?

304
00:18:56,136 --> 00:18:59,471
Look at that chick, she's dancing, man.
She's grooving.

305
00:19:26,624 --> 00:19:27,833
- Joey?
- Yeah.

306
00:19:27,917 --> 00:19:29,585
You know that girl?

307
00:19:32,213 --> 00:19:33,505
No.

308
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:36,050
- You ever see her before?
- No.

309
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:40,429
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I seen her here
about a month ago.

310
00:19:46,561 --> 00:19:48,896
She can dance, you know that?

311
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:52,232
She got the wrong partner, of course,
but she can dance.

312
00:19:54,569 --> 00:19:57,196
- Go ask her.
- Fuck you.

313
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,198
Yeah? Which position?

314
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:10,834
Who the hell's that guy?

315
00:20:23,348 --> 00:20:26,058
- Hey, Penny.
- Hey, Tony!

316
00:20:26,142 --> 00:20:28,060
- How you doing?
- Okay. How you been?

317
00:20:28,144 --> 00:20:29,853
All right. You gonna dance for me?

318
00:20:29,938 --> 00:20:31,939
- Sure, why not?
- Okay.

319
00:20:33,274 --> 00:20:36,402
I'm surviving every lonely day

320
00:20:36,486 --> 00:20:39,154
- Hello, Lucille.
- Hello, Nureyev. How you doing?

321
00:20:39,239 --> 00:20:42,616
- You got a Seven and Seven for me?
- Sure, doll.

322
00:20:42,701 --> 00:20:44,034
Give me one of your butts, too,
all right?

323
00:20:44,119 --> 00:20:45,536
Sure.

324
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:47,705
And it doesn't matter how I cry

325
00:20:48,456 --> 00:20:49,915
My tears of love

326
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,209
Having another sweepstakes.

327
00:20:52,293 --> 00:20:53,752
I know that.

328
00:20:54,546 --> 00:20:57,131
It's double the prize money. $500.

329
00:20:57,215 --> 00:21:01,927
Am I strong enough to see it through
Go crazy is what I will do

330
00:21:02,012 --> 00:21:03,804
You gonna enter?

331
00:21:04,264 --> 00:21:06,390
Well, you'll need a partner.

332
00:21:06,474 --> 00:21:10,978
I don't want nobody, baby
If I can't have you

333
00:21:13,189 --> 00:21:14,815
We won before.

334
00:21:15,358 --> 00:21:17,860
But we're gonna have to practice.

335
00:21:17,944 --> 00:21:19,236
If I can't have you

336
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,030
We'll have to practice.

337
00:21:21,114 --> 00:21:23,490
They got people coming in
from Manhattan.

338
00:21:23,575 --> 00:21:26,035
Revelation, Gazebo's.
You know that, right?

339
00:21:26,119 --> 00:21:28,495
We'll have to practice.

340
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:29,955
That's <<practice,>> Annette.

341
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:32,499
It don't mean dating,
it don't mean socializing,

342
00:21:32,584 --> 00:21:34,418
it means practice.

343
00:21:36,212 --> 00:21:38,464
Why not? We had a date.

344
00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:41,508
Yeah, once, and once was enough.

345
00:21:42,093 --> 00:21:43,385
Why?

346
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:47,181
Why? Annette, the whole time,
you talked about your married sister.

347
00:21:47,265 --> 00:21:50,184
And then, you was talking
about your other married sister.

348
00:21:50,268 --> 00:21:51,894
And then, your third married sister.

349
00:21:51,978 --> 00:21:53,812
I got the idea
that all you was interested in

350
00:21:53,897 --> 00:21:55,689
was being a married sister yourself.

351
00:21:55,774 --> 00:21:57,649
I got bored with it.

352
00:21:57,734 --> 00:22:00,778
Hey, look, I told you
I'd take care of it, huh?

353
00:22:00,862 --> 00:22:04,031
Hey, Tony, look, Double J's been
in the car 25 minutes with some chick.

354
00:22:04,115 --> 00:22:05,199
So what?

355
00:22:05,283 --> 00:22:07,993
So, I can't get the selfish prick out.

356
00:22:08,078 --> 00:22:11,455
These guys can't do nothing without me,
you know that?

357
00:22:12,415 --> 00:22:13,957
If I can't have you

358
00:22:16,836 --> 00:22:21,382
If I can't have you
I don't want nobody, baby

359
00:22:21,466 --> 00:22:23,550
If I can't have you

360
00:22:26,096 --> 00:22:28,222
Hey, listen, are you gonna
make it with Annette?

361
00:22:28,306 --> 00:22:30,182
No, I don't think so.

362
00:22:30,266 --> 00:22:32,267
You know, Joey, you make it
with some of these chicks,

363
00:22:32,352 --> 00:22:33,686
and they think
you gotta dance with them.

364
00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:35,229
Look at this guy, huh?

365
00:22:35,313 --> 00:22:37,773
All right, get out.
You've been in there 20 minutes.

366
00:22:37,857 --> 00:22:40,609
- Come on!
- 25 in the car, 20 in the chick.

367
00:22:40,694 --> 00:22:43,862
Yeah, well, get out
before we pull you out.

368
00:22:43,947 --> 00:22:47,157
- She ain't come yet.
- Since when do you care?

369
00:22:50,495 --> 00:22:52,079
Hey, come on!

370
00:22:52,622 --> 00:22:54,456
Whoa. Okay.

371
00:22:54,541 --> 00:22:56,417
Harder! Harder!
Okay, it's happening!

372
00:22:56,501 --> 00:22:59,378
It's happening! It's happening!

373
00:22:59,462 --> 00:23:01,588
I'll be out in a minute, man.

374
00:23:01,673 --> 00:23:04,508
Harder! I'm coming!
I'm coming!

375
00:23:04,592 --> 00:23:06,593
Oh, yeah!

376
00:23:09,764 --> 00:23:10,931
Yes.

377
00:23:16,563 --> 00:23:17,813
What did you say your name was?

378
00:23:30,243 --> 00:23:33,662
Listen to the ground
There is movement all around

379
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:38,334
There is something going down
And I can feel it

380
00:23:38,543 --> 00:23:40,085
On the waves of the air

381
00:23:40,170 --> 00:23:41,462
Kiss me.

382
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:43,672
Kiss me!

383
00:23:43,757 --> 00:23:46,800
If it's something we can share
We can steal it

384
00:23:47,385 --> 00:23:49,845
Oh, I just kissed Al Pacino!

385
00:23:49,929 --> 00:23:51,889
She moves through the light

386
00:23:51,973 --> 00:23:55,392
Controlling my mind and my soul

387
00:23:56,519 --> 00:24:00,230
When you reach out for me, yeah
And the feeling is bright

388
00:24:00,523 --> 00:24:03,984
Then I get night fever
Night fever

389
00:24:04,361 --> 00:24:06,862
We know how to do it

390
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:13,118
Give me that night fever
Night fever

391
00:24:13,203 --> 00:24:15,746
We know how to show it

392
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:24,129
Here I am
Praying for this moment to last

393
00:24:25,298 --> 00:24:30,678
Living on the music so fine
Borne on the wind

394
00:24:30,762 --> 00:24:35,808
Making it mine

395
00:24:36,518 --> 00:24:39,561
Night fever
Night fever

396
00:24:39,646 --> 00:24:41,605
We know how to do it

397
00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:44,858
Feels like forever, baby
Don't you know

398
00:24:44,943 --> 00:24:48,445
Give me that night fever
Night fever

399
00:24:48,530 --> 00:24:50,614
We know how to show it

400
00:24:54,077 --> 00:24:59,498
Here I am
Praying for this moment to last

401
00:25:00,542 --> 00:25:06,005
Living on the music so fine
Borne on the wind

402
00:25:06,089 --> 00:25:11,093
Making it mine

403
00:25:11,761 --> 00:25:14,763
Night fever
Night fever

404
00:25:14,848 --> 00:25:17,224
We know how to do it

405
00:25:17,308 --> 00:25:20,019
Feels like forever, baby
Don't you know

406
00:25:20,103 --> 00:25:23,689
Give me that night fever
Night fever

407
00:25:23,773 --> 00:25:25,649
We know how to show it

408
00:25:25,734 --> 00:25:28,610
Feels like forever, baby
Don't you know

409
00:25:28,695 --> 00:25:32,406
Give me that night fever
Night fever

410
00:25:32,490 --> 00:25:34,324
We know how to do it

411
00:25:34,909 --> 00:25:37,369
Feels like forever, baby
Don't you know

412
00:25:37,454 --> 00:25:41,206
Give me that night fever
Night fever

413
00:25:41,291 --> 00:25:43,417
We know how to show it

414
00:25:43,501 --> 00:25:46,170
Feels like forever, baby
Don't you know

415
00:25:46,254 --> 00:25:50,049
Give me that night fever
Night fever

416
00:25:50,133 --> 00:25:52,760
We know how to show it

417
00:26:28,421 --> 00:26:31,256
Al Pacino. I don't look like Al Pacino.

418
00:26:33,051 --> 00:26:35,302
Well, I could look like him.

419
00:26:35,387 --> 00:26:36,762
Al Pacino.

420
00:26:37,389 --> 00:26:39,556
Yeah. Al Pacino.

421
00:26:42,644 --> 00:26:45,104
Al Pacino!

422
00:26:45,188 --> 00:26:47,439
<<Attica! Attica!

423
00:26:47,524 --> 00:26:49,650
<<Attica! Attica!

424
00:26:49,734 --> 00:26:51,402
- <<Attica!>>
Hey, give me the ball.

425
00:26:53,113 --> 00:26:54,988
Hey, you wanna go see
that Bruce Lee picture at the Orpheum?

426
00:26:55,073 --> 00:26:56,240
- Yeah!
- Hey, you wanna know something?

427
00:26:56,324 --> 00:26:58,283
Bruce Lee's dead,
so I don't give a damn about him.

428
00:26:58,368 --> 00:27:00,869
- Hey, look.
- Man, you got no respect for the dead.

429
00:27:00,954 --> 00:27:02,162
What kind of shit is that, huh?

430
00:27:02,247 --> 00:27:04,081
Hey, you guys see what the Knicks
are gonna pay Frazier?

431
00:27:04,165 --> 00:27:06,375
We're never gonna make
that much money in our whole life.

432
00:27:06,459 --> 00:27:09,795
Hey, douche! Douche!
- It's all right. It's okay.

433
00:27:09,879 --> 00:27:12,172
Hey, you know why
you don't kill fags on Sunday?

434
00:27:12,257 --> 00:27:14,717
You kill fags on Sunday,
they go straight to heaven.

435
00:27:14,801 --> 00:27:16,427
Hey, sweetheart! Hey, your turn, isn't it?

436
00:27:16,511 --> 00:27:18,804
You look so heavenly,
it makes me want to die, you know?

437
00:27:18,888 --> 00:27:20,681
Hey, Double J, hey!

438
00:27:21,391 --> 00:27:23,308
You know, this is a drag.

439
00:27:23,393 --> 00:27:25,644
What's with you today, huh?

440
00:27:25,729 --> 00:27:27,855
Nothing.
I'd just rather be doing 2001 tonight.

441
00:27:27,939 --> 00:27:29,398
Yeah? Well, fucking do it.

442
00:27:29,482 --> 00:27:31,692
Oh, <<fucking do it. >>
20, 30 bucks, asshole!

443
00:27:31,776 --> 00:27:33,902
You got 20, 30 bucks
to blow twice a week?

444
00:27:33,987 --> 00:27:35,738
- Come on, Tony.
- Hey, Tony.

445
00:27:35,822 --> 00:27:38,157
Man, I'm gonna get myself
one of these, you know.

446
00:27:38,241 --> 00:27:39,616
You're never gonna get yourself
one of these.

447
00:27:39,701 --> 00:27:40,784
These things cost too much money.

448
00:27:40,869 --> 00:27:41,952
You'll never have that kind of money.

449
00:27:42,037 --> 00:27:43,579
Hey, you, you know,
I've had you up to here.

450
00:27:43,663 --> 00:27:44,913
That's your favorite speech.

451
00:27:44,998 --> 00:27:46,081
You're never gonna have
that kind of money.

452
00:27:46,166 --> 00:27:47,291
Not you, not me, not anybody.

453
00:27:47,375 --> 00:27:50,085
Hey, get it together before it's all
over the street, huh? You see this?

454
00:27:50,170 --> 00:27:51,503
This is a Caddy Seville.

455
00:27:51,588 --> 00:27:54,131
My Uncle Nunzio's got one of these
and he's got a Mercedes Benz, too.

456
00:27:54,215 --> 00:27:55,341
You know how he got it?

457
00:27:55,425 --> 00:27:58,302
He forced his partner to sell out.
He gave him a real screwing.

458
00:27:58,386 --> 00:28:01,472
It's a dog-eat-dog world, right?
Everybody's out for what they can get.

459
00:28:01,556 --> 00:28:03,182
It's true.

460
00:28:03,266 --> 00:28:05,059
They got it all locked up.

461
00:28:05,143 --> 00:28:06,602
Ain't nobody gonna give you a chance.

462
00:28:06,686 --> 00:28:08,228
Nobody gives you nothing, Joey.

463
00:28:08,313 --> 00:28:10,856
Yeah, you know,
it's every man for himself.

464
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:13,067
It's a stinking rat race.

465
00:28:15,236 --> 00:28:18,739
Hey, that stuff goes on beautiful, Tony.
Best vinyl I ever seen at that price.

466
00:28:18,823 --> 00:28:21,283
See? I told you.
You just listen to me, right?

467
00:28:21,368 --> 00:28:24,119
You know, you saved me a bit
of change on the job. You know paint.

468
00:28:24,204 --> 00:28:26,372
You ever want a job as a painter,
why don't you let me know, huh?

469
00:28:26,456 --> 00:28:28,207
You make twice as much
as you make here,

470
00:28:28,291 --> 00:28:30,501
but you break your back.
You interested?

471
00:28:30,585 --> 00:28:32,503
- I don't know.
- Don't be interested.

472
00:28:32,587 --> 00:28:36,090
You'll make twice as much,
but you'll break your back.

473
00:28:36,174 --> 00:28:39,468
- No advances, no nothing. It's payday...
- I gave you a raise.

474
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:41,762
- You gave me what?
- A raise.

475
00:28:41,846 --> 00:28:45,641
- You kidding me?
- No. Come on, look. See how much it is.

476
00:28:45,725 --> 00:28:48,102
You gave me a raise? Thank you.
I can't believe this.

477
00:28:48,186 --> 00:28:49,561
Wait, hold on, you better look first.

478
00:28:49,646 --> 00:28:51,271
I don't gotta look.
It don't make no difference.

479
00:28:51,356 --> 00:28:52,940
You gave me a raise.
That's the important thing.

480
00:28:53,024 --> 00:28:55,359
- It's only $2.50.
- So what?

481
00:28:55,443 --> 00:28:57,820
That's $2.50. It ain't much.

482
00:28:57,904 --> 00:29:00,447
The important thing is it's a raise.
I think that's really great.

483
00:29:00,532 --> 00:29:02,449
I'll tell you what,
I'm gonna give you $3.50, all right?

484
00:29:02,534 --> 00:29:03,909
- You do not have to, Mr. Fusco.
- I'll give you $3.50.

485
00:29:03,993 --> 00:29:05,536
- I like the raise just the way it is.
- I'll give you $1 more.

486
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:07,830
Shut up, will you? $4.

487
00:29:07,914 --> 00:29:10,124
I'll make it an even $4.

488
00:29:10,208 --> 00:29:11,500
Christ, I've never seen anybody

489
00:29:11,584 --> 00:29:14,128
so shit-ass happy over
a crummy $2.50 raise.

490
00:29:14,212 --> 00:29:17,673
Wait a minute. $2?
You just said $4.00, didn't you?

491
00:29:22,929 --> 00:29:24,221
What the hell are you doing?

492
00:29:24,305 --> 00:29:26,682
- I just feel like it, all right?
- Girls do that.

493
00:29:26,766 --> 00:29:28,809
I got a raise today.
How do you like that?

494
00:29:28,893 --> 00:29:30,978
Yeah?
Why didn't you say so during dinner?

495
00:29:31,062 --> 00:29:34,565
We could've used the conversation.
Put them down. Come here.

496
00:29:34,649 --> 00:29:37,443
- How much you get?
- It's gonna be $4.00.

497
00:29:37,527 --> 00:29:39,903
It was... It was $2.50, right?

498
00:29:39,988 --> 00:29:41,697
But he raised the raise

499
00:29:41,781 --> 00:29:44,283
when he found out
I wasn't so, you know, disappointed.

500
00:29:44,367 --> 00:29:45,868
- $4.00?
- Yeah.

501
00:29:45,952 --> 00:29:49,079
Shit. You know what $4.00 buys today?

502
00:29:49,164 --> 00:29:51,457
It don't even buy $3.00.

503
00:29:51,541 --> 00:29:54,335
I don't see nobody giving you a raise
down at Unemployment.

504
00:29:54,419 --> 00:29:56,879
$4.00. Shit.

505
00:29:56,963 --> 00:29:59,673
I knew you'd piss on it.
Go on, just piss on it, right?

506
00:29:59,758 --> 00:30:02,343
A raise says, like, you're good,
you know what I mean?

507
00:30:02,427 --> 00:30:04,678
You know how many times somebody
told me I was good in my life?

508
00:30:04,763 --> 00:30:06,930
Two. Two. Twice. Two fucking times,

509
00:30:07,015 --> 00:30:09,933
this raise today and dancing,
dancing at the disco.

510
00:30:10,018 --> 00:30:12,728
You sure as fuck never did. Asshole.

511
00:30:14,898 --> 00:30:17,649
$4.00. Shit.

512
00:30:37,879 --> 00:30:39,421
Why ain't you waiting inside?

513
00:30:39,506 --> 00:30:41,715
Well, I wanted to watch you
come down the street.

514
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:43,425
I like the way you walk.

515
00:30:43,510 --> 00:30:45,344
Shit.

516
00:30:45,428 --> 00:30:49,264
Tony, listen, I've been thinking.

517
00:30:50,266 --> 00:30:52,017
Maybe I'll make it with you.

518
00:30:52,102 --> 00:30:55,312
That's what you call thinking, huh?
Jesus Christ.

519
00:30:56,398 --> 00:30:58,524
You know what? You're too much,
Annette. You know that?

520
00:30:58,608 --> 00:31:01,652
I mean, you say we're gonna make it,
that means we're gonna make it, right?

521
00:31:01,736 --> 00:31:03,570
I mean, like,
I got no say in this at all, right?

522
00:31:03,655 --> 00:31:05,072
It's time we went out.

523
00:31:05,156 --> 00:31:06,657
You told me you wanted to do it.

524
00:31:06,741 --> 00:31:08,575
You told me
how horny a man gets when he's 19,

525
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:10,452
how much his balls ache
morning, noon and night,

526
00:31:10,537 --> 00:31:13,497
six days a week, sometimes seven,
if he don't get it.

527
00:31:13,581 --> 00:31:16,000
How do you remember those things?

528
00:31:16,084 --> 00:31:18,419
Look, Annette, we're gonna be
spending a lot of time together,

529
00:31:18,503 --> 00:31:20,838
you know, rehearsing,
practicing, whatnot.

530
00:31:20,922 --> 00:31:24,049
If we was balling,
it would be like we was going together.

531
00:31:24,134 --> 00:31:26,301
And I won't be going with you.

532
00:31:26,386 --> 00:31:28,971
Look, I mean, what are you, anyway?
You a nice girl or you a cunt?

533
00:31:29,055 --> 00:31:31,181
I don't know. Both?

534
00:31:31,266 --> 00:31:34,059
You can't be both. I mean, that's a thing
a girl's gotta decide early on.

535
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:37,146
You gotta decide whether
you're gonna be a nice girl or a cunt.

536
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:39,356
- How you doing, Pete?
- Hey, Tony, my man.

537
00:31:39,441 --> 00:31:41,775
- You got a studio free or what?
- Yeah, two is free.

538
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:46,113
- Good. Hey, how you doing?
- Steady at 65%.

539
00:31:47,574 --> 00:31:50,576
Pete. He's always busting my onions.

540
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:53,746
I send him a lot of customers, you know.
He gives me free studio time when...

541
00:31:53,830 --> 00:31:55,330
What did he mean, 65%?

542
00:31:56,583 --> 00:31:59,293
Oh, that... Oh, that means that he...

543
00:32:00,253 --> 00:32:03,672
He scores with 65% of the chicks
that come in here.

544
00:32:09,179 --> 00:32:11,513
And one, two, three, two, two, three.

545
00:32:11,639 --> 00:32:13,515
One, two, one, two, three.

546
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,601
One, two, three. Good.
Two, two, three. Good.

547
00:32:15,685 --> 00:32:17,519
One, two, one, two, three.

548
00:32:17,645 --> 00:32:19,104
Good, that's it.

549
00:32:19,189 --> 00:32:20,689
Now do it again.

550
00:32:30,492 --> 00:32:32,618
That's it, good. All right. All right. Again.

551
00:32:32,702 --> 00:32:34,453
Tony, it's only dancing. Jesus.

552
00:32:34,537 --> 00:32:36,789
Only dancing? Forget it, Annette.

553
00:32:36,873 --> 00:32:39,208
If you're not gonna take this seriously,
I don't wanna dance.

554
00:32:39,334 --> 00:32:40,793
- Don't get mad.
- <<Don't get mad. >>

555
00:32:40,877 --> 00:32:42,211
Jesus.

556
00:32:45,507 --> 00:32:48,967
Look, I think we done
enough dancing for today.

557
00:32:49,052 --> 00:32:51,637
So, why don't we... Why don't we
dance Wednesday, all right?

558
00:32:51,721 --> 00:32:53,222
Yeah. Sure.

559
00:32:53,973 --> 00:32:56,141
- All right. Here.
- You walking home now?

560
00:32:56,226 --> 00:32:59,728
No. I'm gonna stick around
and talk to Peter a little bit,

561
00:32:59,854 --> 00:33:02,731
and, you know,
work on some stuff myself.

562
00:33:02,857 --> 00:33:05,150
- I'll see you later, all right?
- Yeah.

563
00:33:05,235 --> 00:33:07,027
You was good today.

564
00:33:34,097 --> 00:33:36,432
Hi. How you doing?

565
00:33:40,103 --> 00:33:43,564
Hey, you know, you're
a very good dancer, you know that?

566
00:33:45,567 --> 00:33:47,609
I would like to meet you.

567
00:33:49,362 --> 00:33:52,281
Look, would you...
Would you mind just going away, okay?

568
00:33:52,365 --> 00:33:54,366
- What?
- Don't be hurt, but I...

569
00:33:54,451 --> 00:33:55,617
Don't be hurt?

570
00:33:55,702 --> 00:33:58,287
Yeah, I wanna be by myself now,
you know?

571
00:33:58,413 --> 00:33:59,788
Listen, I seen you at 2001
the other night.

572
00:33:59,914 --> 00:34:01,540
Yeah, so? So?

573
00:34:01,624 --> 00:34:04,209
Well, I mean, you was looking at me
and I was looking at you, remember?

574
00:34:04,294 --> 00:34:06,879
Well, what is this? I look at a guy
longer than a millionth of a second,

575
00:34:06,963 --> 00:34:10,049
already, he gets delusions of grandeur.

576
00:34:10,133 --> 00:34:12,551
You know what you are?
I'm gonna tell you what you are.

577
00:34:12,635 --> 00:34:15,554
I bet it begins with a <<C,>> Mr. P.

578
00:34:15,638 --> 00:34:18,974
Oh, fine. Fine. That's...

579
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:21,935
I know the type. I know the type. Fine.

580
00:34:30,653 --> 00:34:33,155
What you doing up so late?

581
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:37,076
What is this? I walk in,
you don't got no criticism of me?

582
00:34:38,119 --> 00:34:41,246
- Your brother's upstairs.
- You're kidding.

583
00:34:41,331 --> 00:34:43,248
- Yo, Frankie!
- Tony.

584
00:34:43,333 --> 00:34:45,668
- Hey, how you doing?
- Hiya, kid.

585
00:34:48,129 --> 00:34:50,089
- It's good to see you.
- You, too.

586
00:34:50,173 --> 00:34:52,508
Yeah. You look good.

587
00:34:52,592 --> 00:34:55,511
No, I don't. You do. You look wonderful.

588
00:34:55,637 --> 00:34:58,263
- You checking out my trophy?
- Oh, yeah. That's you, huh?

589
00:34:58,348 --> 00:35:00,182
- Yeah.
- <<First prize. >>

590
00:35:00,934 --> 00:35:02,851
Looks just like you.

591
00:35:02,936 --> 00:35:04,436
Hey, what did you say
to them downstairs?

592
00:35:04,521 --> 00:35:06,355
They look crazy,
they look like zombies, like...

593
00:35:06,481 --> 00:35:08,524
Like somebody died or something.

594
00:35:08,650 --> 00:35:10,693
I think they're in shock, Tony.

595
00:35:10,777 --> 00:35:14,363
In shock?
Well, how come they're in shock?

596
00:35:14,447 --> 00:35:16,699
I'm leaving the church, Tony.

597
00:35:17,534 --> 00:35:20,327
Oh, yeah, yeah. Sure.
Leaving the church.

598
00:35:21,496 --> 00:35:24,832
- Tell me another one.
- I'm leaving the priesthood.

599
00:35:25,875 --> 00:35:28,961
Oh, come on, Frank.
Don't fool around like that.

600
00:35:29,045 --> 00:35:30,879
Do you think I'm losing my hair?

601
00:35:30,964 --> 00:35:33,882
It looks awful thin
right over here and here.

602
00:35:35,885 --> 00:35:38,303
Are you serious?

603
00:35:38,388 --> 00:35:40,222
Can I borrow some of your clothes
until I buy some?

604
00:35:40,306 --> 00:35:42,725
I don't want to wear the uniform.

605
00:35:44,227 --> 00:35:46,311
I'm sorry, Frank. I really am. I'm sorry.

606
00:35:46,396 --> 00:35:48,397
What are you sorry about?

607
00:35:49,482 --> 00:35:51,400
You got fired, huh?

608
00:35:51,526 --> 00:35:53,485
I didn't get fired. I quit.

609
00:35:53,570 --> 00:35:54,737
You quit?

610
00:35:54,863 --> 00:35:57,573
Yeah, you can do those things,
you know.

611
00:36:06,583 --> 00:36:10,169
What did Mom say?
What did she say about it?

612
00:36:10,253 --> 00:36:14,840
She said, <<Dear Lord, what am I
gonna tell Theresa and Marie?>>

613
00:36:14,924 --> 00:36:18,427
- And Dad? What did he say about it?
- They're ashamed, the both of them.

614
00:36:18,553 --> 00:36:20,554
They're ashamed, right?

615
00:36:22,223 --> 00:36:24,266
You ashamed of me, Tony?

616
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:27,269
Yeah, you are.

617
00:36:28,772 --> 00:36:31,940
- They didn't ask why or nothing?
- No.

618
00:36:32,025 --> 00:36:35,778
I think they're afraid to.
Like, I might say, <<celibacy. >>

619
00:36:39,282 --> 00:36:40,449
But...

620
00:36:47,624 --> 00:36:50,793
You gonna sleep here tonight?
You wanna sleep in my room?

621
00:36:50,877 --> 00:36:53,796
- Yeah, I thought I would.
- All right, you can...

622
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:56,256
I'll get your blankets for you.

623
00:37:16,111 --> 00:37:18,612
Frank, how come you left? Really?

624
00:37:22,409 --> 00:37:25,828
It's not easy to explain, Anthony.
A lot of things.

625
00:37:26,913 --> 00:37:29,331
One day, you look at a crucifix,

626
00:37:30,792 --> 00:37:33,919
and all you see
is a man dying on a cross.

627
00:37:35,255 --> 00:37:38,173
But that's only a backdrop
to something else.

628
00:37:39,259 --> 00:37:43,429
Mama and Papa,
their dreams of pious glory.

629
00:37:43,972 --> 00:37:46,974
They turn you
into what they wish at a time...

630
00:37:48,476 --> 00:37:52,271
You can't defend yourself
against their fantasies.

631
00:37:52,355 --> 00:37:56,525
All I ever really had any belief in
was their image of me as a priest.

632
00:37:56,651 --> 00:37:58,027
That's all.

633
00:38:05,952 --> 00:38:10,122
Guess we're gonna have to take
your picture down from the mantle.

634
00:38:14,377 --> 00:38:16,462
Know what's weird?

635
00:38:16,546 --> 00:38:19,715
Like, I always felt like
I was the shit of the family,

636
00:38:19,841 --> 00:38:21,216
and you was always, like, perfect.

637
00:38:21,301 --> 00:38:25,679
Now that I'm the disgrace to the family,
I'm not so perfect anymore.

638
00:38:26,473 --> 00:38:29,058
So, maybe you're not shit anymore.

639
00:38:31,519 --> 00:38:35,314
Yeah, maybe if you ain't so good,
I ain't so bad, you know?

640
00:38:35,982 --> 00:38:40,402
Yeah.

641
00:38:46,910 --> 00:38:48,494
- Give me the groceries, motherfucker.
- Hey, come on.

642
00:38:48,578 --> 00:38:49,912
=Hey, don't take my groceries, man.
- I'm hungry.

643
00:38:50,038 --> 00:38:51,413
- I'm hungry, Gus.
- Hey, what are you doing?

644
00:38:51,539 --> 00:38:53,916
Hey, come on! Hey, come on!
Hey, don't eat the apple!

645
00:38:54,042 --> 00:38:55,918
- Give me... Give me it back.
- Here.

646
00:38:56,044 --> 00:38:58,170
Jesus.
What's the matter with you anyway?

647
00:38:58,254 --> 00:39:00,589
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

648
00:39:00,674 --> 00:39:02,508
My brother, he quit the Church.
You believe that?

649
00:39:02,592 --> 00:39:04,009
- I feel...

650
00:39:04,094 --> 00:39:06,178
I feel wild. I got all this energy.
I can't believe it.

651
00:39:06,262 --> 00:39:07,346
Yeah?

652
00:39:07,430 --> 00:39:08,847
Hey, listen, I'll call you later tonight,
all right?

653
00:39:08,932 --> 00:39:10,265
Yeah, we'll do... Hey!

654
00:39:10,350 --> 00:39:12,893
- See you later, Gus.
- I'll see you.

655
00:39:15,063 --> 00:39:16,105
Come on, honey, higher with the arms.

656
00:39:16,231 --> 00:39:18,273
Yeah, that's it.

657
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:20,401
Yeah, do it to me!

658
00:39:23,363 --> 00:39:24,697
Pete, she come in?

659
00:39:24,781 --> 00:39:26,949
I told you on the phone,
she comes in on Tuesday.

660
00:39:27,033 --> 00:39:29,868
- I know. So, did she come in or what?
- And what is it today, huh?

661
00:39:29,953 --> 00:39:31,745
- It's Tuesday.
- Yeah.

662
00:39:33,707 --> 00:39:37,543
Hey, Ton! Watch it, man.
That one's practicing to be a bitch.

663
00:39:37,627 --> 00:39:39,378
Come on, people!

664
00:39:40,714 --> 00:39:45,092
Good, yeah. Oh, that's good.
You're doing great. Yeah.

665
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:19,668
Hello, Stephanie Mangano.

666
00:40:19,794 --> 00:40:22,087
I'm Tony Manero.

667
00:40:22,172 --> 00:40:25,174
We both got the same last initials.
How do you like that?

668
00:40:25,258 --> 00:40:27,343
Wow. We get married,
I don't have to change the monogram

669
00:40:27,469 --> 00:40:29,345
on my luggage, huh?

670
00:40:30,847 --> 00:40:33,015
Somebody told me
you was practicing to be a bitch.

671
00:40:33,141 --> 00:40:34,350
Is that true?

672
00:40:41,775 --> 00:40:43,942
All right, Mr. Manero.
What do you want to ask me?

673
00:40:44,027 --> 00:40:46,028
I would like to take you out to coffee.
Would that be good?

674
00:40:46,154 --> 00:40:48,113
That's it, huh?
You want me to have coffee with you?

675
00:40:48,198 --> 00:40:50,115
I think you're a very good dancer.

676
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:53,869
You know that 2001 Odyssey,

677
00:40:53,953 --> 00:40:56,455
they got a dance contest now.

678
00:40:56,539 --> 00:41:00,042
And I think that we could be
a dynamite team together.

679
00:41:03,630 --> 00:41:05,964
- How old are you, huh?
- I'm 20.

680
00:41:07,217 --> 00:41:12,137
Well, I'm 19 at the moment,
but I'll be 20 very shortly.

681
00:41:12,222 --> 00:41:13,722
What I think is this.

682
00:41:13,807 --> 00:41:15,724
There's a world of difference
between us, you know?

683
00:41:15,850 --> 00:41:18,560
Not just chronologically,
but emotionally,

684
00:41:18,687 --> 00:41:21,063
culturally, physically, every which way.

685
00:41:21,147 --> 00:41:22,815
And this world would get much bigger

686
00:41:22,899 --> 00:41:25,693
and much worse
with every passing week.

687
00:41:26,403 --> 00:41:28,112
What kind of shit is that?

688
00:41:28,238 --> 00:41:30,781
- Coffee, not sex.
- Just coffee, huh?

689
00:41:30,907 --> 00:41:33,659
See, look, where I work,
the people are very remarkable.

690
00:41:33,743 --> 00:41:36,245
They're not like these here
Bay Ridge people at all.

691
00:41:36,371 --> 00:41:38,372
You mean snobs
instead of slobs, right?

692
00:41:38,456 --> 00:41:40,332
- What?
- Nothing.

693
00:41:40,417 --> 00:41:42,501
Hey, you know, Bay Ridge
ain't the worst part of Brooklyn.

694
00:41:42,585 --> 00:41:43,669
You know what I'm talking?

695
00:41:43,753 --> 00:41:45,421
I mean, you know,
it ain't like a hellhole or nothing.

696
00:41:45,547 --> 00:41:48,298
Yeah, well, it ain't Manhattan.
It isn't Manhattan.

697
00:41:48,425 --> 00:41:50,217
You got no idea how it changes,
you know.

698
00:41:50,301 --> 00:41:51,719
Just right over there,
right across the river,

699
00:41:51,803 --> 00:41:53,971
everything is different,
completely different.

700
00:41:54,097 --> 00:41:55,556
It's beautiful, just beautiful.

701
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:58,475
The people are beautiful,
offices are beautiful.

702
00:41:58,601 --> 00:42:01,270
The secretaries, you know,
they all shop at Bonwit Teller.

703
00:42:01,396 --> 00:42:02,479
Oh, yeah?

704
00:42:02,605 --> 00:42:04,398
And, like, the lunch hours
are beautiful, too.

705
00:42:04,482 --> 00:42:07,818
Like, you know, they'll give you,
like, two hours for lunch

706
00:42:07,944 --> 00:42:09,611
- to do something that's related.
- Oh, yeah?

707
00:42:09,738 --> 00:42:12,531
Like we've seen
Zeffirelli's Romeo and Juliet.

708
00:42:12,615 --> 00:42:16,535
Over here. Romeo and Juliet, yeah?
I read that in high school.

709
00:42:16,619 --> 00:42:19,621
That's... That's Shakespeare, right?

710
00:42:19,748 --> 00:42:22,708
No, it's Zeffirelli,
the director of the movie.

711
00:42:22,792 --> 00:42:25,878
- You know, the movie? Film.
- Yeah.

712
00:42:25,962 --> 00:42:28,380
You know what?
What I never understood

713
00:42:28,465 --> 00:42:30,341
about that Romeo and Juliet,

714
00:42:30,467 --> 00:42:33,761
I never understood why Romeo,
he took the poison so quick, you know?

715
00:42:33,845 --> 00:42:36,513
I feel like he could have waited
or something.

716
00:42:36,639 --> 00:42:39,641
Well, that's the way
they took the poison in those days.

717
00:42:41,519 --> 00:42:43,896
Hey, you gonna eat?
Here, look at a menu.

718
00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:46,940
No, no. I'll just have tea.
Tea with lemon.

719
00:42:47,817 --> 00:42:51,528
I started drinking tea recently, you know.
It's really a lot more refined.

720
00:42:51,654 --> 00:42:53,364
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

721
00:42:53,490 --> 00:42:54,948
All those women executives
in my office,

722
00:42:55,033 --> 00:42:56,492
they all drink tea with lemon.

723
00:42:56,618 --> 00:43:00,120
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah. And you notice that I do, too.

724
00:43:00,205 --> 00:43:03,499
- I like coffee, you know? I drink coffee.
- Yeah.

725
00:43:07,003 --> 00:43:10,714
You see, like, I've only been
at this agency a really short time,

726
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:15,469
but already I'm functioning in a, kind of,
public relations capacity, you know.

727
00:43:15,553 --> 00:43:18,180
I fill in for the agents
when they're elsewhere.

728
00:43:18,306 --> 00:43:20,724
Like, this week, you know, I had...

729
00:43:20,850 --> 00:43:23,727
I had business lunches
with Eric Clapton at La Cote Basque

730
00:43:23,853 --> 00:43:26,855
- and Cat Stevens at Le Madrigal.
- Oh, far out.

731
00:43:26,981 --> 00:43:30,359
Yeah. You heard of
those restaurants, huh?

732
00:43:30,485 --> 00:43:34,446
No, I don't know
those exact restaurants.

733
00:43:34,531 --> 00:43:35,739
I know the type.

734
00:43:35,865 --> 00:43:37,950
Yeah, but you must have heard
of the artists.

735
00:43:38,034 --> 00:43:40,953
No, I... Not... I don't know... You know.

736
00:43:41,037 --> 00:43:42,496
Not really.

737
00:43:43,206 --> 00:43:45,124
So what did you say <<far out>> for, huh?

738
00:43:45,208 --> 00:43:47,710
'Cause it sounded, like, far out.
Wasn't it? I mean...

739
00:43:47,836 --> 00:43:50,921
- Well, yeah.
- We'd like a lemon with some tea now.

740
00:43:51,047 --> 00:43:54,550
And I'd like a cheeseburger
and some coffee.

741
00:44:00,557 --> 00:44:02,599
Hey, you know who came
in the office the other day?

742
00:44:02,726 --> 00:44:04,727
- Who?
- Laurence Olivier.

743
00:44:04,853 --> 00:44:05,978
Who's that?

744
00:44:06,062 --> 00:44:09,356
Who's Laurence Olivier?
You don't know who he is?

745
00:44:09,441 --> 00:44:10,774
Laurence Olivier, man!

746
00:44:10,900 --> 00:44:12,985
He's the greatest actor
in the whole world.

747
00:44:13,069 --> 00:44:15,154
Oh, come on, you know who he is.

748
00:44:15,238 --> 00:44:16,447
He's the English actor,

749
00:44:16,573 --> 00:44:19,491
the one on television who does
all those Polaroid commercials.

750
00:44:19,576 --> 00:44:21,869
You know, Laurence Olivier.

751
00:44:21,953 --> 00:44:24,705
- Oh, him. Oh, he's good. He is good.
- Yeah.

752
00:44:24,789 --> 00:44:26,498
Well, anyway,
he comes in the office, right?

753
00:44:26,583 --> 00:44:28,167
So, I just do a few errands for him.

754
00:44:28,251 --> 00:44:30,419
So, he goes around,
he tells everybody in the entire office,

755
00:44:30,545 --> 00:44:31,754
he says I'm the brightest,

756
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:35,424
I'm the most vivacious thing
in the entire office he's seen in years.

757
00:44:35,550 --> 00:44:36,967
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

758
00:44:37,093 --> 00:44:41,680
Do you think that you could get, like,
a camera from him at a discount?

759
00:44:41,765 --> 00:44:44,433
I didn't ask him about a camera.

760
00:44:44,559 --> 00:44:46,643
'Cause you got one already, right,
you sly fox, you.

761
00:44:46,770 --> 00:44:48,687
Hey, look, are you enjoying
all this stuff I'm telling you?

762
00:44:48,772 --> 00:44:50,147
Sure. I think it's good.

763
00:44:50,273 --> 00:44:52,649
Well, I just think maybe you can't handle
hearing about a kind of life

764
00:44:52,776 --> 00:44:55,819
that is so completely different
than yours.

765
00:44:55,945 --> 00:44:59,281
- You mean <<better,>> don't you?
- Yes, I mean better. Sure, it's better.

766
00:44:59,407 --> 00:45:01,116
Can I have some ketchup, please?

767
00:45:01,242 --> 00:45:03,035
I mean, I'm out of this scene
almost completely,

768
00:45:03,119 --> 00:45:05,204
you know, this Bay Ridge scene.
I'm moving into Manhattan.

769
00:45:05,288 --> 00:45:07,748
I'm getting my own apartment.

770
00:45:07,832 --> 00:45:09,333
I'm changing.

771
00:45:09,459 --> 00:45:11,710
I'm really changing as a person,
and I'm growing.

772
00:45:11,795 --> 00:45:14,296
You know what I mean? Nobody has
any idea how much I'm growing.

773
00:45:14,422 --> 00:45:15,964
Why don't you go on a diet?

774
00:45:22,305 --> 00:45:25,099
Okay, listen. I like you.
We could dance together.

775
00:45:25,183 --> 00:45:27,685
That's it. We could just dance together
and nothing more.

776
00:45:27,811 --> 00:45:29,937
Nothing personal.
I don't want you coming on to me.

777
00:45:30,021 --> 00:45:31,105
Why not?

778
00:45:31,189 --> 00:45:33,691
Because I don't date guys
like you anymore, for one thing.

779
00:45:33,817 --> 00:45:35,943
You're too young,
you haven't got any class, and, yeah,

780
00:45:36,027 --> 00:45:38,570
I'm sick of jerk-off guys
ain't got their shit together!

781
00:45:38,655 --> 00:45:41,323
Oh, come on.
It's easy to get your shit together.

782
00:45:41,449 --> 00:45:44,827
All you need is a salad bowl
and a potato masher.

783
00:45:45,704 --> 00:45:47,413
Get your shit together.

784
00:45:47,497 --> 00:45:50,124
- Would you like to know what I do?
- It's not necessary.

785
00:45:50,208 --> 00:45:51,959
I'll tell you what I do.

786
00:45:52,043 --> 00:45:55,212
I work in a paint store,
and I got a raise this week.

787
00:45:55,338 --> 00:45:57,089
Right. You work in a paint store, right?

788
00:45:57,173 --> 00:45:59,466
You probably live with your family,
you hang out with your buddies,

789
00:45:59,551 --> 00:46:02,469
and on Saturday night you go,
you blow it all off at 2001, right?

790
00:46:02,554 --> 00:46:05,180
- That's right.
- You're a cliche.

791
00:46:05,306 --> 00:46:08,183
You're nowhere,
on your way to no place.

792
00:46:11,855 --> 00:46:14,273
What do you got?
A fucking stairway to the stars or what?

793
00:46:14,357 --> 00:46:15,649
- Yeah, maybe.
- Yeah.

794
00:46:15,734 --> 00:46:17,317
I'm taking a course, nights,
at the new school.

795
00:46:17,402 --> 00:46:19,069
Next semester, I'm gonna take two.

796
00:46:19,195 --> 00:46:20,904
Now, you, you probably
didn't get no college, did you?

797
00:46:21,031 --> 00:46:22,197
No, I did not.

798
00:46:22,323 --> 00:46:24,116
Well, did you ever think
about going to college?

799
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:25,576
- No.
- Not ever?

800
00:46:25,702 --> 00:46:27,453
- No. Did you?
- Well, not back then, no...

801
00:46:27,537 --> 00:46:29,496
Then why the fuck
are you bugging me about it for?

802
00:46:29,581 --> 00:46:31,665
Well, why not? Why didn't
you ever want to go to college?

803
00:46:31,750 --> 00:46:34,251
- Oh, just fuck off, will you? I did not.
- No, really. Tell me. Why not?

804
00:46:34,377 --> 00:46:36,545
Oh, Jesus Christ! I didn't!

805
00:46:41,051 --> 00:46:44,011
The thing is
the high I get at 2001 is just dancing,

806
00:46:44,095 --> 00:46:47,431
it's not being the best
or nothing like that.

807
00:46:47,557 --> 00:46:49,975
The only thing is
that I would like to get that high

808
00:46:50,060 --> 00:46:53,228
someplace else in my life. You know?

809
00:46:53,355 --> 00:46:54,897
Like where?

810
00:46:55,023 --> 00:46:58,442
I don't know where.
I don't know. Someplace.

811
00:46:58,568 --> 00:47:01,445
You see, dancing, it can't last forever.

812
00:47:01,571 --> 00:47:04,073
It's a short-lived kind of thing.

813
00:47:04,199 --> 00:47:06,617
But I'm getting older, you know.

814
00:47:08,244 --> 00:47:09,244
You know, I feel like...

815
00:47:09,371 --> 00:47:11,246
I feel like, you know,
so what, I'm getting older.

816
00:47:11,373 --> 00:47:13,916
Does that mean, like, I can't feel
that way about nothing left in my life?

817
00:47:14,042 --> 00:47:15,876
You know? Is that it?

818
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:18,504
Listen, we gotta split here.

819
00:47:18,588 --> 00:47:20,964
No, I'll walk you the rest of the way.

820
00:47:21,091 --> 00:47:24,677
No, I'll meet you at the dance studio,
just like we said, okay?

821
00:47:24,761 --> 00:47:26,470
Stephanie, I can walk you home.

822
00:47:26,596 --> 00:47:29,431
Look, nothing personal, right?

823
00:47:29,557 --> 00:47:32,309
Oh, come on, Stephanie. I can walk you.

824
00:47:33,645 --> 00:47:37,272
Oh, Jesus Christ! You know?

825
00:47:45,156 --> 00:47:46,490
I don't know where he is.

826
00:47:46,616 --> 00:47:48,492
- Did you call him?
- No.

827
00:47:53,123 --> 00:47:54,832
What's the matter? What's going on?

828
00:47:54,958 --> 00:47:57,751
It's Gus, man. He's in the hospital.
The spics got him.

829
00:47:57,836 --> 00:47:59,503
- Spanish Barons?
- Barracudas.

830
00:47:59,629 --> 00:48:01,964
- Hey, that's my fucking car!
- Forget the car!

831
00:48:02,090 --> 00:48:04,008
- Save it for the spics.
- Just give me the keys.

832
00:48:04,134 --> 00:48:07,052
- You're asking for it.
- I can't believe it. I just saw him.

833
00:48:07,137 --> 00:48:09,847
He could have run, you know?
But he hung tight. That's Gus.

834
00:48:09,973 --> 00:48:12,016
Don't worry about it.
Okay? All right?

835
00:48:12,142 --> 00:48:13,809
I got in the hospital to see him.

836
00:48:13,935 --> 00:48:17,438
He got a broken nose, busted ribs,
a broken leg and four teeth knocked out.

837
00:48:17,522 --> 00:48:18,605
Shit.

838
00:48:18,690 --> 00:48:21,442
I mean, all he was doing was walking
along the street carrying his groceries,

839
00:48:21,526 --> 00:48:23,193
and three of them
do a shove number on him.

840
00:48:23,319 --> 00:48:25,696
They spill his fucking groceries
into the street.

841
00:48:25,822 --> 00:48:28,782
So, he says under his breath,
<<grease balls, spic dicks,>>

842
00:48:28,867 --> 00:48:30,200
and they laid into him.

843
00:48:42,130 --> 00:48:44,298
All right. Go check it out.

844
00:49:02,067 --> 00:49:04,068
Nobody in there, man.

845
00:49:08,031 --> 00:49:09,698
All right, all right.
This is what we're gonna do.

846
00:49:09,824 --> 00:49:10,908
We're just gonna cruise around

847
00:49:11,034 --> 00:49:12,826
until there's enough of them
that we can handle.

848
00:49:12,911 --> 00:49:15,037
Yeah, yeah, we'll just pick
off a couple on the street.

849
00:49:15,163 --> 00:49:16,997
- That's pussy, man!
- Fuck, man. Fuck.

850
00:49:17,082 --> 00:49:20,209
- You're fucked up!
- I'm sorry, guys.

851
00:49:20,335 --> 00:49:23,295
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

852
00:49:23,380 --> 00:49:24,713
You're sorry.

853
00:49:25,256 --> 00:49:27,675
Oh, forget it. We'll get them tomorrow.

854
00:49:31,429 --> 00:49:34,181
All right, dream good. Jerk off better.

855
00:49:36,893 --> 00:49:39,019
Tony, I'm getting married.

856
00:49:39,896 --> 00:49:41,230
Will you cut it with that shit?

857
00:49:41,356 --> 00:49:44,024
No, listen.
I just wanted to let you know, all right?

858
00:49:44,109 --> 00:49:45,526
All right. Look. If you get married,

859
00:49:45,610 --> 00:49:47,361
we'll all go with you
on your honeymoon, all right?

860
00:49:47,445 --> 00:49:50,781
- You will? Okay.
- Okay, good. Take it easy.

861
00:49:50,907 --> 00:49:53,367
Come on, Bobby. Get in the car.

862
00:49:54,077 --> 00:49:55,452
Hey.

863
00:49:55,578 --> 00:49:58,205
Hey, you know,
we should go to the hospital tomorrow.

864
00:49:58,289 --> 00:49:59,957
You know what I'm talking?

865
00:50:00,083 --> 00:50:03,544
And you, cool off! You know?

866
00:50:03,628 --> 00:50:05,587
All right. Good night.

867
00:50:28,737 --> 00:50:31,321
Tony, what did you say
to Father Frank, Jr.?

868
00:50:31,448 --> 00:50:33,657
- What?
- What did you say? What did you do?

869
00:50:33,783 --> 00:50:35,034
Yeah, what did you say?

870
00:50:35,118 --> 00:50:39,121
- What are you talking about?
- You must have said something to him.

871
00:50:39,247 --> 00:50:40,789
You sleep in the same room.
You talk to him.

872
00:50:40,874 --> 00:50:42,958
The next night he stays out all night,
he don't come back.

873
00:50:43,043 --> 00:50:45,961
- I said nothing to him.
- A priest staying out all night.

874
00:50:46,046 --> 00:50:47,463
A priest is not a priest no more,

875
00:50:47,547 --> 00:50:49,715
and he's grown up,
so he can do what he wants.

876
00:50:49,799 --> 00:50:51,633
Something you said to him.

877
00:50:51,718 --> 00:50:54,178
Oh, yeah? You try and blame me
now he ain't a priest no more?

878
00:50:54,304 --> 00:50:55,971
You been writing to him.

879
00:50:56,056 --> 00:50:59,224
I don't believe this.
You're trying to hang this on me?

880
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:03,312
Forget it, all right?
He called. He called. He called.

881
00:51:03,396 --> 00:51:06,482
In a couple of days
he's gonna see he's wrong.

882
00:51:06,566 --> 00:51:09,485
He's going through, like,
a trial of the soul, you know?

883
00:51:09,569 --> 00:51:11,236
He's going back to the church.
He's going back.

884
00:51:11,321 --> 00:51:12,863
No, he won't.
He's not going back to the church.

885
00:51:12,989 --> 00:51:14,323
Yes he is.
He's going back to the church!

886
00:51:14,407 --> 00:51:16,158
I'm telling you, he's going back!

887
00:51:17,494 --> 00:51:19,370
You know what?
You don't got a priest no more!

888
00:51:19,496 --> 00:51:20,579
And you got no saint!

889
00:51:20,663 --> 00:51:22,748
You got nothing
but three shit children now!

890
00:51:22,832 --> 00:51:24,833
Good. Good.

891
00:51:27,003 --> 00:51:28,170
No.

892
00:51:34,844 --> 00:51:36,512
I'm sorry, Mom.

893
00:51:38,682 --> 00:51:40,182
I just...

894
00:51:41,017 --> 00:51:44,144
I didn't mean that. I'm sorry.
I'll never say that.

895
00:51:44,229 --> 00:51:46,689
I love you, Mom. I really do.

896
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:49,441
Go on. Get out of here.

897
00:52:02,789 --> 00:52:04,289
- How you doing, Annette?
- Okay.

898
00:52:04,374 --> 00:52:05,749
- That's good.
- Yeah.

899
00:52:05,875 --> 00:52:10,254
Hey, listen, look, Annette.
I gotta tell you something, all right?

900
00:52:10,380 --> 00:52:13,340
It's very hard to tell you this, but...

901
00:52:13,425 --> 00:52:16,468
I changed my mind
about us dancing together.

902
00:52:16,553 --> 00:52:18,470
I got another partner.

903
00:52:22,058 --> 00:52:24,643
Look, it's professional.
You know what I mean? It's like...

904
00:52:24,728 --> 00:52:27,896
Things like this happen
when it's professional.

905
00:52:28,481 --> 00:52:31,608
Oh, Jesus Christ.
My fucking mother, now you.

906
00:52:32,152 --> 00:52:34,028
Why do you hate me so much?

907
00:52:34,112 --> 00:52:36,739
All I ever did to you was like you.

908
00:52:37,323 --> 00:52:39,241
Give me a break, huh?

909
00:52:54,424 --> 00:52:55,674
Hi.

910
00:52:55,759 --> 00:52:57,259
You're late.

911
00:52:57,927 --> 00:52:59,928
Five minutes. That's not late.

912
00:53:00,013 --> 00:53:01,472
How long you been here?

913
00:53:01,598 --> 00:53:03,932
I don't know.
Six, seven, something like that.

914
00:53:04,017 --> 00:53:06,393
Pete said you been here 15.

915
00:53:06,478 --> 00:53:08,604
Well, who's he?

916
00:53:08,688 --> 00:53:12,274
Hey, I got some records over here.
I don't know if you like them or not.

917
00:53:12,359 --> 00:53:15,611
- You like these guys?
- Yeah, yeah. Super.

918
00:53:16,863 --> 00:53:19,990
Do you do the New York hustle,
the Latin hustle, what?

919
00:53:20,116 --> 00:53:22,785
- New York, Latin, I do it all.
- Okay.

920
00:53:33,630 --> 00:53:37,841
Girl, I've known you very well
I've seen you growing every day

921
00:53:37,967 --> 00:53:42,638
I never really looked before
But now you take my breath away

922
00:53:42,722 --> 00:53:46,934
Suddenly you're in my life
A part of everything I do

923
00:53:47,018 --> 00:53:51,438
You got me working day and night
Just trying to keep a hold on you

924
00:53:51,523 --> 00:53:53,273
Follow me this time.

925
00:53:53,358 --> 00:53:56,652
I found my paradise

926
00:53:56,736 --> 00:54:00,197
My only chance for happiness

927
00:54:01,241 --> 00:54:03,367
And if I lose you now
I think I would die

928
00:54:03,493 --> 00:54:05,953
Yeah, that's really nice.
What'd you do, make that up?

929
00:54:06,037 --> 00:54:08,914
Yeah. Yeah. No, I saw it on TV first.

930
00:54:08,998 --> 00:54:10,958
Then I made it up.

931
00:54:11,042 --> 00:54:13,127
Hey, you know what? I know this one.
What I do is...

932
00:54:13,211 --> 00:54:16,338
Wait a minute. This is simple.
Let me just check something out.

933
00:54:17,173 --> 00:54:20,092
More than a woman

934
00:54:21,678 --> 00:54:26,140
More than a woman to me
Baby

935
00:54:26,224 --> 00:54:28,350
More than a woman

936
00:54:30,729 --> 00:54:33,772
- Come on. Come on.
- What you doing?

937
00:54:40,447 --> 00:54:42,573
Okay, stay right there.

938
00:54:52,208 --> 00:54:53,667
Now we can dance.

939
00:54:53,752 --> 00:54:55,419
Let me show you the step, okay?

940
00:54:55,545 --> 00:54:57,671
The Latin one I was
gonna show you, okay?

941
00:54:57,756 --> 00:55:01,133
Now, take your hand like this,
and count one, two, three.

942
00:55:01,217 --> 00:55:05,220
Two, two, three.
Three, two, three, kick, two, three.

943
00:55:06,473 --> 00:55:07,723
- Okay, I got that.
- Okay?

944
00:55:07,807 --> 00:55:09,558
- Looks good.
- All right.

945
00:55:11,227 --> 00:55:15,647
More than a woman to me
Baby

946
00:55:16,232 --> 00:55:18,067
- That's good. I like that.
- Yeah.

947
00:55:18,151 --> 00:55:20,444
- Do you know the tango hustle?
- Yeah, yeah.

948
00:55:20,570 --> 00:55:22,446
Okay, let's try that.

949
00:55:26,951 --> 00:55:30,162
More than a woman

950
00:55:33,583 --> 00:55:38,629
There are stories old and true
Of people so in love like you and me

951
00:55:38,755 --> 00:55:42,257
And I can see myself
Let history repeat itself

952
00:55:42,342 --> 00:55:46,845
Reflecting how I feeI for you
Thinking about those people then

953
00:55:46,930 --> 00:55:49,139
I know that in a thousand years

954
00:55:52,018 --> 00:55:56,522
This is the only way that we should fly

955
00:55:56,606 --> 00:56:00,651
This is the only way to go

956
00:56:00,944 --> 00:56:04,780
And if I lose you
I know I would die

957
00:56:04,864 --> 00:56:09,743
Oh, say you'll always be my baby
We can make it shine

958
00:56:09,828 --> 00:56:14,373
We can take forever
Just a minute at a time

959
00:56:14,457 --> 00:56:16,917
Minute at a time

960
00:56:17,002 --> 00:56:21,296
More than a woman
More than a woman

961
00:56:21,381 --> 00:56:23,841
More than a woman to me

962
00:56:23,967 --> 00:56:26,051
Yes, you are, baby

963
00:56:26,136 --> 00:56:30,472
More than a woman
More than a woman

964
00:56:30,557 --> 00:56:34,727
More than a woman to me

965
00:56:36,855 --> 00:56:38,647
- Would you like some coffee?
- Yeah.

966
00:56:38,732 --> 00:56:41,567
No, no. Look, I really gotta go home.

967
00:56:43,695 --> 00:56:46,864
You know something?
I like you when you're like this.

968
00:56:46,990 --> 00:56:51,660
When you're quiet and you ain't laying
all that shit on me and everything.

969
00:56:51,995 --> 00:56:53,370
Oh, yeah? Well, as a matter of fact,

970
00:56:53,496 --> 00:56:55,706
guess who I had lunch with today?
Paul Anka.

971
00:56:55,832 --> 00:56:57,416
I had to open my big mouth, right?

972
00:56:57,500 --> 00:57:00,210
It was very interesting.
Very interesting. Very interesting.

973
00:57:00,337 --> 00:57:02,463
Very, very intelligent fellow.

974
00:57:02,547 --> 00:57:05,257
You cream over that word,
<<interesting,>> don't you?

975
00:57:05,342 --> 00:57:07,843
- Well, what's wrong with <<interesting>>?
- I don't know, something.

976
00:57:07,927 --> 00:57:09,094
You know, I want to tell you something.

977
00:57:09,179 --> 00:57:12,222
I've never told you this before,
but I think you're full of shit.

978
00:57:12,349 --> 00:57:14,933
- Oh, you do, do you, huh?
- Yeah, except I'm not sure.

979
00:57:15,018 --> 00:57:17,728
I'm not sure how much is just shit
and how much is bullshit.

980
00:57:17,854 --> 00:57:21,774
Well, listen, when you figure it out,
just let me know, all right?

981
00:57:23,777 --> 00:57:26,236
We should really practice
a couple more times.

982
00:57:26,363 --> 00:57:28,489
Maybe go to 2001 with a crowd.

983
00:57:28,573 --> 00:57:30,741
How about Saturday?
Would that be good?

984
00:57:30,867 --> 00:57:32,201
Maybe.

985
00:57:33,036 --> 00:57:36,372
Stephanie, I wanna
ask you something, all right?

986
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:39,416
I don't know how to say this.

987
00:57:42,212 --> 00:57:45,631
Do you think that I am
either interesting or intelligent?

988
00:57:47,759 --> 00:57:50,052
Interesting? Yeah. Yeah.

989
00:57:50,136 --> 00:57:51,720
Intelligent?

990
00:57:53,640 --> 00:57:55,557
I don't know. Maybe.

991
00:57:56,768 --> 00:57:58,519
I don't know. I gotta know you better.
You know what I mean?

992
00:57:58,603 --> 00:58:00,479
You got a way of putting things together,
you know?

993
00:58:00,563 --> 00:58:02,231
Seeing things a certain way.

994
00:58:02,315 --> 00:58:04,608
Interesting? Yeah, yeah.

995
00:58:04,734 --> 00:58:08,654
Intelligent? Yeah, maybe.
Maybe intelligent.

996
00:58:08,738 --> 00:58:10,614
Well, what do you know?

997
00:58:11,950 --> 00:58:13,325
All right.

998
00:58:13,410 --> 00:58:16,245
Hey, Stephanie,
how come we never talk

999
00:58:16,329 --> 00:58:17,788
about how we feel when we're dancing?

1000
00:58:17,914 --> 00:58:20,916
- How come we never talk about that?
- Good night and thanks.

1001
00:58:21,001 --> 00:58:23,252
No, maybe I could walk you
the rest of the way.

1002
00:58:23,336 --> 00:58:25,295
- Let me do that.
- Nope.

1003
00:58:28,008 --> 00:58:31,218
You shouldn't have asked.
You should have just done it.

1004
00:58:31,302 --> 00:58:33,262
Oh, hot stuff, Jesus.

1005
00:58:37,976 --> 00:58:42,730
If I can't have you
I don't want nobody, baby

1006
00:58:42,814 --> 00:58:45,315
If I can't have you

1007
00:58:47,152 --> 00:58:51,864
If I can't have you
I don't want nobody, baby

1008
00:58:51,948 --> 00:58:54,867
If I can't have you

1009
00:58:56,119 --> 00:59:00,581
If I can't have you
I don't want nobody, baby

1010
00:59:00,665 --> 00:59:03,167
If I can't have you

1011
00:59:16,639 --> 00:59:19,058
- Hey, what's happening, Tony?
- Bob, what's up? My brother, Frank.

1012
00:59:19,142 --> 00:59:20,976
Hey, how you doing? Double J.

1013
00:59:21,478 --> 00:59:27,316
Don't know why
I'm surviving every lonely day

1014
00:59:27,984 --> 00:59:30,319
When there's got to be

1015
00:59:30,403 --> 00:59:32,321
Hey, how you doing?

1016
00:59:32,530 --> 00:59:34,114
My life would end

1017
00:59:34,199 --> 00:59:36,742
- Come on up to the table over there.
- Oh, okay.

1018
00:59:39,496 --> 00:59:43,916
My tears of love are a waste of time

1019
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:49,922
If I turn away
Am I strong enough to see it through

1020
00:59:50,757 --> 00:59:54,051
Go crazy is what I will do

1021
00:59:54,177 --> 00:59:55,886
You guys have the Moses effect.

1022
00:59:56,012 --> 00:59:58,931
You arrive
and the crowd parts like the Red Sea.

1023
00:59:59,015 --> 01:00:00,683
They know we're the faces, that's all.

1024
01:00:00,767 --> 01:00:03,977
- How do you like it, Father?
- What father? I look like your father?

1025
01:00:04,062 --> 01:00:07,564
Please don't call me that.
I never could stand that.

1026
01:00:07,691 --> 01:00:10,442
But, yeah, I think the place is,
you know, energizing.

1027
01:00:10,527 --> 01:00:13,153
It's all right, huh?
- Great.

1028
01:00:13,238 --> 01:00:14,405
Good place.

1029
01:00:18,368 --> 01:00:23,539
Disco inferno

1030
01:00:23,623 --> 01:00:25,541
- Tony.
- Hey.

1031
01:00:25,917 --> 01:00:27,209
Hey.

1032
01:00:27,544 --> 01:00:30,879
Are you as good in bed
as you are on that dance floor?

1033
01:00:33,049 --> 01:00:34,633
Well, are you?

1034
01:00:35,135 --> 01:00:37,761
Are you as good in bed
as you are on the dance floor?

1035
01:00:37,887 --> 01:00:41,098
- Hey, he never made it in a bed.
- Watch this.

1036
01:00:41,224 --> 01:00:44,143
This ain't my regular partner,
but you'll see.

1037
01:00:47,105 --> 01:00:49,481
Ton, what are you gonna have to drink?
We'll get you something, huh?

1038
01:00:49,566 --> 01:00:52,151
- Seven and Seven.
- Seven and Seven.

1039
01:00:52,819 --> 01:00:55,404
When my spark gets hot

1040
01:00:57,073 --> 01:00:59,241
I just can't stop

1041
01:01:00,577 --> 01:01:03,579
When my spark gets hot

1042
01:01:08,835 --> 01:01:11,754
So, when's Connie
gonna get her answer, huh?

1043
01:01:13,089 --> 01:01:15,299
- You know, Connie.
- Yeah.

1044
01:01:15,425 --> 01:01:17,843
If you're as good in bed
as you are on the dance floor,

1045
01:01:17,927 --> 01:01:20,679
I'll bet you're one lousy fuck.

1046
01:01:20,764 --> 01:01:24,183
So, how come they always send me
flowers the next day, huh?

1047
01:01:24,267 --> 01:01:26,435
You know, some guys don't know
a lousy fuck when they got one.

1048
01:01:26,519 --> 01:01:29,104
- You know what I mean?
- Oh, yeah?

1049
01:01:29,189 --> 01:01:31,231
Maybe they thought you was dead.

1050
01:01:31,316 --> 01:01:33,817
Father, wanna hear something? Listen.

1051
01:01:33,943 --> 01:01:36,862
I got a girlfriend of mine, you know.
She's such a good Catholic, Father.

1052
01:01:36,946 --> 01:01:40,199
She tells me she loves the taste
of communion wafers.

1053
01:01:42,577 --> 01:01:44,411
Hey, Mr. Manero,
could I talk to you for a sec?

1054
01:01:44,496 --> 01:01:45,746
- Hey, what's he doing?
- Frank.

1055
01:01:45,830 --> 01:01:47,081
Frank, yeah,
Frank, yeah. Listen...

1056
01:01:49,084 --> 01:01:50,793
Oh, forget this.

1057
01:01:51,753 --> 01:01:55,172
Look out. Give the kid some room.
He's taking over again.

1058
01:01:55,256 --> 01:01:56,423
- All right!
- All right!

1059
01:01:56,508 --> 01:01:57,716
Go, go!

1060
01:01:59,427 --> 01:02:02,304
My baby moves at midnight

1061
01:02:02,389 --> 01:02:03,597
Right on.

1062
01:02:03,890 --> 01:02:06,225
Goes right on till the dawn

1063
01:02:07,185 --> 01:02:09,812
My woman takes me higher

1064
01:02:09,896 --> 01:02:11,397
There he goes.

1065
01:02:12,607 --> 01:02:15,025
Okay, babe.
There he goes.

1066
01:02:15,193 --> 01:02:17,695
What you doing on your back?

1067
01:02:18,947 --> 01:02:21,198
What you doing on your back?

1068
01:02:22,158 --> 01:02:25,786
You should be dancing
Yeah

1069
01:02:26,830 --> 01:02:30,457
Dancing
Yeah

1070
01:02:30,542 --> 01:02:33,419
She's juicy and she's trouble

1071
01:02:34,337 --> 01:02:36,755
She gives it to me good

1072
01:02:38,258 --> 01:02:41,927
My woman gives me power

1073
01:02:42,429 --> 01:02:45,347
Goes right down to my blood

1074
01:02:46,182 --> 01:02:48,726
What you doing on your back?

1075
01:02:50,103 --> 01:02:52,521
What you doing on your back?

1076
01:02:53,231 --> 01:02:57,192
You should be dancing
Yeah

1077
01:02:57,944 --> 01:03:01,238
Dancing
Yeah

1078
01:03:01,740 --> 01:03:04,324
What you doing on your back?

1079
01:03:05,618 --> 01:03:08,078
What you doing on your back?

1080
01:03:09,706 --> 01:03:13,000
Dancing
Yeah

1081
01:03:13,501 --> 01:03:16,670
Dancing
Yeah

1082
01:03:40,820 --> 01:03:43,322
My baby moves at midnight

1083
01:03:44,824 --> 01:03:46,283
Go, Tony!

1084
01:03:48,536 --> 01:03:49,787
Yeah!

1085
01:03:49,871 --> 01:03:52,247
My woman takes me higher

1086
01:03:52,332 --> 01:03:54,708
My woman keeps me warm

1087
01:03:56,419 --> 01:03:58,587
What you doing on your back?

1088
01:04:00,256 --> 01:04:02,466
What you doing on your back?

1089
01:04:03,510 --> 01:04:06,720
You should be dancing
Yeah

1090
01:04:06,805 --> 01:04:08,180
Oh, yeah.

1091
01:04:08,390 --> 01:04:11,016
Dancing, yeah

1092
01:04:12,894 --> 01:04:16,397
- He's very good, yeah.
- He's the king out there, Father.

1093
01:04:17,440 --> 01:04:19,775
- He's the best.
- Hey, man, he's great. He's great.

1094
01:04:19,859 --> 01:04:21,402
You know, man?

1095
01:04:23,655 --> 01:04:26,949
Dancing
Yeah

1096
01:04:27,909 --> 01:04:29,535
Listen, can I talk to you
for a second, Father?

1097
01:04:29,619 --> 01:04:31,161
Yes, but call me Frank.

1098
01:04:31,246 --> 01:04:34,999
Frank? Frank, listen. Come here.
You wanna hear something? Listen.

1099
01:04:35,083 --> 01:04:37,751
I got... My girlfriend, you know...
Can I tell you something?

1100
01:04:37,836 --> 01:04:39,253
- Yeah.
- Come here for a sec.

1101
01:04:39,337 --> 01:04:41,839
Listen, Frank. Wanna hear something?

1102
01:04:41,923 --> 01:04:44,925
I got a lot of ideas. You see, like,
I was reading up about the Pope.

1103
01:04:45,010 --> 01:04:46,719
- Hey, Father?
- Yeah, sure. Frank, Frank.

1104
01:04:46,803 --> 01:04:48,679
Frank. Yeah, Frank. Yeah, Frank.

1105
01:04:48,763 --> 01:04:52,808
Okay, Frank. Listen, Frank,
I got a girlfriend, you know?

1106
01:04:52,892 --> 01:04:54,643
She's Pauline.
Her name's Pauline. And...

1107
01:04:54,728 --> 01:04:57,062
Yeah. What do you mean, you got her...

1108
01:04:57,147 --> 01:04:58,981
Did you get her pregnant?

1109
01:04:59,065 --> 01:05:01,525
Yes, I did. Yes. Yes, I did.

1110
01:05:02,527 --> 01:05:04,486
She loves the taste
of communion wafers.

1111
01:05:04,571 --> 01:05:07,656
Well, I got a lot of ideas, you know,
swimming around in my head.

1112
01:05:07,741 --> 01:05:09,742
And I was reading a lot of stuff lately.

1113
01:05:09,826 --> 01:05:13,829
I heard, like, the Pope, he gives special,

1114
01:05:13,913 --> 01:05:15,789
- you know...
- Dispensation.

1115
01:05:15,874 --> 01:05:20,127
Yeah. Do you think the Pope
could give Pauline an abortion?

1116
01:05:20,211 --> 01:05:22,671
You mean give you
a dispensation for an abortion?

1117
01:05:22,756 --> 01:05:25,341
Yeah, you think you could do this?

1118
01:05:26,176 --> 01:05:27,801
I don't think so, Bobby.

1119
01:05:27,886 --> 01:05:30,220
Well, maybe, you know,
maybe you could do it for me.

1120
01:05:30,305 --> 01:05:33,390
- Maybe?
- I'm sorry, Bobby. I don't think so.

1121
01:05:33,475 --> 01:05:34,725
I was just thinking.

1122
01:05:34,809 --> 01:05:36,769
Have you talked to your priest about it?

1123
01:05:36,853 --> 01:05:39,730
Yeah, I talk to everybody about it.

1124
01:05:39,814 --> 01:05:42,191
I talked to a lot of people.
A lot of people. A lot of people.

1125
01:05:42,275 --> 01:05:44,860
All right, thank you.
Thanks a lot. All right?

1126
01:05:44,944 --> 01:05:47,988
You play, you pay. It's funny, huh?

1127
01:05:50,325 --> 01:05:54,078
Don't forget, everybody.
You could win, too, man.

1128
01:05:54,162 --> 01:05:56,997
Disco Universe sweepstakes,
just a week away.

1129
01:05:57,082 --> 01:05:58,874
500 bucks. 500 big ones.

1130
01:05:58,958 --> 01:06:01,377
- Do you know Stephanie Mangano?
- No.

1131
01:06:01,461 --> 01:06:03,295
- No?
- I know Stephanie.

1132
01:06:03,380 --> 01:06:05,964
- Did she come in yet?
- No, she didn't get in yet.

1133
01:06:06,049 --> 01:06:07,841
- You sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

1134
01:06:10,970 --> 01:06:13,472
MONTl: Right, right.
Don't forget again, baby,

1135
01:06:13,556 --> 01:06:15,933
UniversaI Disco sweepstakes,
just a week away.

1136
01:06:16,017 --> 01:06:17,851
Tony! Tony, that was really great.

1137
01:06:17,936 --> 01:06:19,144
- Oh, you liked it?
- Yeah.

1138
01:06:19,229 --> 01:06:20,604
Listen, I'm gonna go home now.
All right?

1139
01:06:20,689 --> 01:06:22,272
- You're gonna go home?
- Yeah.

1140
01:06:22,357 --> 01:06:25,693
No, no, stay a little longer, Frank.
The night's just beginning.

1141
01:06:25,777 --> 01:06:28,445
Yeah, I know,
but it's not my scene, you know?

1142
01:06:28,530 --> 01:06:30,948
Come on. You didn't expect me
to stay the whole night, did you?

1143
01:06:31,032 --> 01:06:32,658
No, no. I didn't...

1144
01:06:32,742 --> 01:06:36,245
Yes, I thought maybe
you'd stay a little longer.

1145
01:06:36,329 --> 01:06:39,123
- No, it's not your scene. Of course not.
- I'm sorry, Tony.

1146
01:06:39,207 --> 01:06:41,208
Don't worry about it.
It's nothing, you know.

1147
01:06:41,292 --> 01:06:43,002
So what, right? Come on.

1148
01:06:43,086 --> 01:06:45,170
I'll walk you to the door.

1149
01:06:45,255 --> 01:06:49,299
Hey, you know,
your dancing is really marvelous.

1150
01:06:49,384 --> 01:06:52,302
It's exciting. I mean, it's exciting
to watch you out there.

1151
01:06:52,387 --> 01:06:55,014
They can't keep their eyes off of you.

1152
01:06:55,473 --> 01:06:56,890
Look, I got to go now, okay?
I'll see you later.

1153
01:06:56,975 --> 01:06:59,143
All right, well, have a good night.
I'll see you later. All right?

1154
01:06:59,227 --> 01:07:00,477
Yeah, you, too.

1155
01:07:00,562 --> 01:07:02,271
Hey, she come in or what?

1156
01:07:02,355 --> 01:07:05,649
Hey, you just asked me,
and I told you she isn't here.

1157
01:07:10,447 --> 01:07:13,323
And I can't wait till I see you again

1158
01:07:13,408 --> 01:07:16,243
- Tony, your brother, is he okay?
- He's fine.

1159
01:07:16,327 --> 01:07:19,288
He just had a stomach thing.
I don't know.

1160
01:07:19,581 --> 01:07:24,084
I want to put on
My, my, my, my, my boogie shoes

1161
01:07:24,669 --> 01:07:27,796
Just to boogie with you
Yeah

1162
01:07:27,881 --> 01:07:29,590
I want to put on

1163
01:07:29,674 --> 01:07:31,258
Just the two of them.

1164
01:07:31,343 --> 01:07:33,010
My, my, my, my, my boogie shoes

1165
01:07:33,094 --> 01:07:35,179
Just to boogie with you

1166
01:07:36,306 --> 01:07:38,223
- We could make it now.
- What?

1167
01:07:38,308 --> 01:07:40,559
We ain't practicing,
seeing each other like you said,

1168
01:07:40,643 --> 01:07:41,852
so we could make it.

1169
01:07:41,936 --> 01:07:44,396
Look, Annette, we make it
when I decide, all right?

1170
01:07:44,481 --> 01:07:45,606
No other time.

1171
01:07:45,690 --> 01:07:47,149
- All right.
- When I say so, all right?

1172
01:07:47,233 --> 01:07:49,401
I'll just make it with somebody else.

1173
01:07:49,486 --> 01:07:51,403
Who? Who?

1174
01:07:51,488 --> 01:07:53,781
Somebody. I don't care. Anybody here.

1175
01:07:53,865 --> 01:07:56,075
- Oh, somebody here?
- Yeah.

1176
01:07:56,159 --> 01:07:58,452
Double J, Joey.

1177
01:07:58,536 --> 01:08:00,579
Oh, the fuck you will.
Hey, look. Hey, Bobby.

1178
01:08:00,663 --> 01:08:02,373
Look, we're gonna go out to the car,

1179
01:08:02,457 --> 01:08:05,793
and when I get back,
we'll go to the bridge, all right?

1180
01:08:09,422 --> 01:08:10,798
You fixed?

1181
01:08:12,092 --> 01:08:13,258
- Huh?
- Hmm?

1182
01:08:13,343 --> 01:08:15,594
- You fixed?
- What do you mean?

1183
01:08:16,680 --> 01:08:19,682
- You know, are you on the pill or what?
- No.

1184
01:08:20,350 --> 01:08:21,517
No?

1185
01:08:22,894 --> 01:08:25,604
What do you got, the IOU, that thing?

1186
01:08:25,897 --> 01:08:27,815
- Huh?
- No.

1187
01:08:28,858 --> 01:08:30,359
No diaphragm?

1188
01:08:31,069 --> 01:08:32,569
- Nothing?
- It doesn't matter, though.

1189
01:08:32,654 --> 01:08:35,114
- You don't got nothing?
- It doesn't matter. Tony, I love you.

1190
01:08:35,198 --> 01:08:36,657
Are you kidding me?

1191
01:08:36,741 --> 01:08:38,784
Oh, forget it. Oh, fuck.

1192
01:08:38,868 --> 01:08:41,620
Just give me a blowjob.
Ready? Come on.

1193
01:08:45,583 --> 01:08:47,501
- Just a minute.
Hey, Tony!

1194
01:08:47,585 --> 01:08:50,587
Forget it. Forget it. Just fix yourself up.

1195
01:08:51,006 --> 01:08:52,840
Everything was cool.
Everything was all right.

1196
01:08:52,924 --> 01:08:54,758
You had a good time.

1197
01:09:07,230 --> 01:09:09,106
Annette, cigarette?

1198
01:09:11,985 --> 01:09:13,610
Guess not, huh?

1199
01:09:52,025 --> 01:09:53,650
Stupid goofs.

1200
01:10:07,916 --> 01:10:11,752
Hey, Annette, can you dig it?
I knew that you could.

1201
01:10:20,887 --> 01:10:23,430
- Joey!
- You're fucked, Double J.

1202
01:10:24,182 --> 01:10:25,641
- Hey, Tony.
- What?

1203
01:10:25,725 --> 01:10:28,060
Come on.
Let's get this selfish motherfucker.

1204
01:10:28,144 --> 01:10:29,812
- All right.
- Let's push him off.

1205
01:10:29,896 --> 01:10:32,648
All right.
- You're going in, you big, fucking hump!

1206
01:10:36,361 --> 01:10:38,612
Come on, Ton. Let's get him.

1207
01:10:40,949 --> 01:10:43,158
Come on. Let's go. Shit.

1208
01:10:44,119 --> 01:10:47,037
Hey, come on, let's get the fucking
show off and throw him the fuck off.

1209
01:10:47,122 --> 01:10:48,455
Hey, Tarzan!

1210
01:10:55,672 --> 01:10:57,381
Look out, Double J!

1211
01:10:59,259 --> 01:11:01,552
Don't worry about nothing! I'm coming!

1212
01:11:06,808 --> 01:11:08,183
You fuckers!

1213
01:11:08,268 --> 01:11:11,812
- Can you dig it? I knew that you could.
- I knew that you could.

1214
01:11:14,816 --> 01:11:16,567
You stupid bitch.

1215
01:11:28,163 --> 01:11:30,581
I wish you was staying longer,
you know, Frank?

1216
01:11:30,665 --> 01:11:33,167
Ex-priests don't stay back home.

1217
01:11:33,251 --> 01:11:35,961
Listen, everyone's too shocked
and disgraced.

1218
01:11:36,046 --> 01:11:37,212
A family raises a priest,

1219
01:11:37,297 --> 01:11:38,714
they think
they've scored points in heaven,

1220
01:11:38,798 --> 01:11:41,050
- and now they're gonna lose them.
- Hey, Frank. How you doing?

1221
01:11:41,134 --> 01:11:44,720
Okay. We better get a move on.
I gotta pick some people on the way.

1222
01:11:44,804 --> 01:11:47,890
Okay. Listen, we gotta keep in touch.

1223
01:11:47,974 --> 01:11:49,641
Yeah. You gonna like
this settlement house?

1224
01:11:49,726 --> 01:11:50,893
What do you think?

1225
01:11:50,977 --> 01:11:53,312
- It'll do until I figure out my next move.
- Yeah.

1226
01:11:53,396 --> 01:11:55,481
- What about you?
- What about me?

1227
01:11:55,565 --> 01:11:57,483
Are you gonna do something
with your dancing, Tony?

1228
01:11:57,567 --> 01:11:59,485
I don't know.
People ask me all the time.

1229
01:11:59,569 --> 01:12:02,905
But I don't know, I mean, you know,
I feel like my whole life, right,

1230
01:12:02,989 --> 01:12:05,908
I've been told I'm the no-good
in the family and that...

1231
01:12:05,992 --> 01:12:11,080
Tony, the only way you're gonna survive
is to do what you think is right,

1232
01:12:11,164 --> 01:12:14,249
not what they keep trying
to jam you into.

1233
01:12:14,334 --> 01:12:18,128
You let them do that and you're
gonna end up nothing but miserable.

1234
01:12:18,213 --> 01:12:19,505
Huh?

1235
01:12:23,635 --> 01:12:26,512
- Hey, have a good trip, all right?
- Yeah.

1236
01:12:28,098 --> 01:12:30,140
I left you something in your room.

1237
01:12:30,266 --> 01:12:32,476
- What did you leave me?
- A souvenir.

1238
01:12:33,687 --> 01:12:34,978
Money?

1239
01:12:36,481 --> 01:12:38,107
Leave me money.

1240
01:13:16,646 --> 01:13:18,147
Hey.

1241
01:13:18,940 --> 01:13:20,607
So, what are you standing there for?

1242
01:13:20,692 --> 01:13:22,651
How come you wasn't there
Saturday night?

1243
01:13:22,736 --> 01:13:25,154
I didn't say I was gonna be there
Saturday night.

1244
01:13:25,238 --> 01:13:28,824
- The fuck you didn't.
- I said maybe. Maybe's a maybe.

1245
01:13:28,908 --> 01:13:30,993
I didn't think you'd go
and get upset about it.

1246
01:13:31,077 --> 01:13:34,413
Oh, forget upset. I'm not upset.
It's just that we needed the practice.

1247
01:13:34,497 --> 01:13:36,040
I mean, you know,
you should've been there.

1248
01:13:36,124 --> 01:13:38,917
All right, right, let's practice then.

1249
01:13:40,920 --> 01:13:42,087
We can't.

1250
01:13:42,172 --> 01:13:44,965
I didn't bring the records 'cause
I didn't think you was gonna be here.

1251
01:13:45,050 --> 01:13:47,718
Yeah? So what did you come for, huh?

1252
01:13:51,264 --> 01:13:55,517
- Stugats. You know <<stugats>>?
- Yeah, I know <<stugats. >>

1253
01:13:55,602 --> 01:13:57,144
All right, we'll use some of this stuff.

1254
01:13:57,228 --> 01:14:00,189
<<If you're not of a mind to break up... >>

1255
01:14:01,483 --> 01:14:02,816
What's up?

1256
01:14:02,901 --> 01:14:04,735
We've been waiting, man.

1257
01:14:04,819 --> 01:14:06,653
Pete said you was practicing, you know.

1258
01:14:06,738 --> 01:14:09,573
Hey, Tony, we were cruising
you know who. Looking good.

1259
01:14:09,657 --> 01:14:12,368
Not now. Don't talk about it now.
Talk about it later.

1260
01:14:12,452 --> 01:14:16,038
Stephanie, this is Joey,
this is Double J, this is Bobby C.

1261
01:14:16,122 --> 01:14:18,290
How you doing, Stephanie?
=How do you do?

1262
01:14:18,375 --> 01:14:20,167
- You a dancer?
- Yeah.

1263
01:14:20,251 --> 01:14:22,169
- You hungry?
- Yeah.

1264
01:14:22,253 --> 01:14:24,088
What do you wanna eat, huh?

1265
01:14:26,383 --> 01:14:28,926
- I'm gonna change and then...
- All right.

1266
01:14:29,803 --> 01:14:32,888
What maracas. She's got maracas.
She's got nice tits.

1267
01:14:34,891 --> 01:14:36,558
It's like,
I'm gonna be traveling, you know.

1268
01:14:36,643 --> 01:14:38,936
Promotional tours
with authors and performers.

1269
01:14:39,020 --> 01:14:41,146
Of course, I'm gonna hate
to leave Manhattan, even briefly.

1270
01:14:41,231 --> 01:14:44,316
There's certain ballets and concerts
I'm just gonna have to miss.

1271
01:14:44,401 --> 01:14:46,235
Tell them about the people
who come into the office.

1272
01:14:46,319 --> 01:14:47,861
That's what they wanna hear.
Tell them that.

1273
01:14:47,946 --> 01:14:50,948
Oh, you know who came in today?
This guy, David Bowie.

1274
01:14:51,032 --> 01:14:53,742
- He comes in, has this Astrakhan coat...
- He's a fagot.

1275
01:14:53,827 --> 01:14:57,538
- He's a half-fagot, man.
- Hey, relax! Come on. Sit down.

1276
01:14:57,622 --> 01:14:59,456
You mean, he's a bisexual.

1277
01:14:59,541 --> 01:15:01,500
Yeah, he swings both ways.
Men and boys.

1278
01:15:02,794 --> 01:15:04,712
- What's so funny?
- Oh, yeah?

1279
01:15:04,796 --> 01:15:08,173
Well, you know who came in today?
Joe Namath. You know Joe Namath?

1280
01:15:08,258 --> 01:15:10,175
He comes in
and he wants some coffee,

1281
01:15:10,260 --> 01:15:11,385
so I brought him coffee.

1282
01:15:11,469 --> 01:15:13,637
And then he asked me to sit down,
have some coffee with him.

1283
01:15:13,722 --> 01:15:14,847
You had coffee with Joe Namath?

1284
01:15:14,931 --> 01:15:17,224
Yeah, that's right.
We were talking a little bit.

1285
01:15:17,308 --> 01:15:20,144
He wanted to know
what it was like to be 21.

1286
01:15:20,228 --> 01:15:22,646
I told him I didn't know
'cause I was just 20.

1287
01:15:22,731 --> 01:15:25,274
- Yeah, what else?
- That's all.

1288
01:15:25,358 --> 01:15:26,483
Ain't that enough?

1289
01:15:26,568 --> 01:15:28,777
Hey, don't you never chew, Tony?
Don't you never chew?

1290
01:15:28,862 --> 01:15:31,488
Hey, look, when my mother dies,
I'll give you the job, all right?

1291
01:15:31,573 --> 01:15:32,948
You know what's going
down your throat, man?

1292
01:15:33,033 --> 01:15:34,408
Big chunks of hamburger, you know.

1293
01:15:34,492 --> 01:15:37,369
Big gobs, like dog food,
dog friskies, dog yummies.

1294
01:15:37,454 --> 01:15:40,372
You know something, Joey?
He's gonna turn into a dog.

1295
01:15:55,513 --> 01:15:58,140
Stephanie, listen,
can I talk to you for a second?

1296
01:15:58,224 --> 01:15:59,808
I was listening
to what you said in there before,

1297
01:15:59,893 --> 01:16:04,646
and you seem to know a lot of people,
and a lot of places and a lot of things.

1298
01:16:04,731 --> 01:16:06,231
I got a friend of mine, you know,

1299
01:16:06,316 --> 01:16:09,902
he's a very good friend of mine
and he got a girl pregnant.

1300
01:16:09,986 --> 01:16:12,237
He got a girl pregnant,
and I wanted to know

1301
01:16:12,322 --> 01:16:14,156
if you had to make a choice

1302
01:16:14,240 --> 01:16:16,784
between getting an abortion
and have to get married to somebody,

1303
01:16:16,868 --> 01:16:18,369
what would you do?

1304
01:16:18,453 --> 01:16:20,704
Well, who would I have to marry?

1305
01:16:21,873 --> 01:16:25,125
You'd have to marry me.
You'd have to marry me. Yeah.

1306
01:16:25,210 --> 01:16:27,670
I think I'd get an abortion.
Hey, so long, Tony.

1307
01:16:27,754 --> 01:16:29,963
It's very nice meeting you.

1308
01:16:30,757 --> 01:16:32,132
So, what'd you guys think of her?

1309
01:16:32,217 --> 01:16:35,135
Hey, Tony, I liked her.
I thought she was nice. I liked her a lot.

1310
01:16:35,220 --> 01:16:37,346
She's a snotty bitch, man.

1311
01:16:37,972 --> 01:16:40,474
She's cool.
You just gotta get to know her, that's all.

1312
01:16:40,558 --> 01:16:42,559
Hey, Ton, did you fuck her, yet?

1313
01:16:42,644 --> 01:16:44,520
- What do you think?
- I don't think so.

1314
01:16:44,604 --> 01:16:47,398
You know, you guys got a lot
of growing up to do, you know that?

1315
01:16:47,482 --> 01:16:49,983
A lot of growing up. You're babies.

1316
01:16:50,568 --> 01:16:52,277
Yeah.

1317
01:16:52,362 --> 01:16:55,864
Hey, Mr. Fusco, look,
I need the afternoon off.

1318
01:16:55,949 --> 01:16:58,784
Sam's out. Harold's sick.
Here, take these.

1319
01:16:58,868 --> 01:17:01,704
- But I gotta, Mr. Fusco.
- Sorry, Tony.

1320
01:17:01,788 --> 01:17:03,997
Look, all I'm asking for
is one afternoon off.

1321
01:17:04,082 --> 01:17:06,291
I've been here almost eight months.
I didn't miss a day yet!

1322
01:17:06,376 --> 01:17:09,378
- Not today, Tony.
- Oh, come on, Mr. Fusco.

1323
01:17:09,462 --> 01:17:11,880
Some of those old farts,
they miss three, four days at a time,

1324
01:17:11,965 --> 01:17:13,173
you don't say nothing to them.

1325
01:17:13,258 --> 01:17:14,800
Hey, cool off.

1326
01:17:14,884 --> 01:17:17,428
Look, I got to have the afternoon off.
I'm taking it.

1327
01:17:17,512 --> 01:17:19,805
- You do, you're fired.
- I'm doing it.

1328
01:17:19,889 --> 01:17:23,225
- Then you're fired!
- Then fuck you, asshole!

1329
01:17:24,102 --> 01:17:26,270
And the fuck horse you rode in on.

1330
01:17:26,354 --> 01:17:28,022
- Fucking cocksucker asshole!
- Tony.

1331
01:17:28,106 --> 01:17:31,108
Tony, I don't wanna marry Pauline.
I don't give a fuck about this cunt.

1332
01:17:31,192 --> 01:17:34,069
- So, don't marry her!
- Tony, I gotta marry her!

1333
01:17:34,154 --> 01:17:35,779
Fuck it. She won't get the abortion.

1334
01:17:35,864 --> 01:17:38,615
- Everyone says I gotta marry her, Tony.
- Who says that?

1335
01:17:38,700 --> 01:17:41,118
Oh, fuck, her fucking parents,
my fucking parents.

1336
01:17:41,202 --> 01:17:43,203
The fucking priest on the corner.

1337
01:17:43,288 --> 01:17:46,040
Her fucking high school
guidance counselor.

1338
01:17:46,124 --> 01:17:48,500
Tony, I'm paralyzed.
I got no more control.

1339
01:17:48,585 --> 01:17:51,045
I mean, you and me, Tony,
we've been friends for so long.

1340
01:17:51,129 --> 01:17:53,088
I mean, I'm hurting.

1341
01:17:54,174 --> 01:17:57,176
Shit! You're always together.

1342
01:17:57,260 --> 01:18:00,095
And I'm always fucking up,
and you're always all right. You know?

1343
01:18:00,180 --> 01:18:03,682
I... Oh, come on.
Everybody fucks up. Really.

1344
01:18:03,767 --> 01:18:06,477
- Don't worry about nothing.
- You know, you're great.

1345
01:18:06,561 --> 01:18:08,854
I'm in a terrible rush.
I hate to leave you like this.

1346
01:18:08,938 --> 01:18:10,689
You got no idea
how much I appreciate this.

1347
01:18:10,774 --> 01:18:12,691
I mean, this car's very important
for me today, you know?

1348
01:18:12,776 --> 01:18:14,568
- Will you call me tonight?
- Yeah, I'll call you.

1349
01:18:14,652 --> 01:18:16,612
Don't worry about nothing, all right?
Take care.

1350
01:18:16,696 --> 01:18:19,365
- I'll talk to you later then?
- Yeah.

1351
01:18:19,449 --> 01:18:21,617
- Call me tonight, right?
- Yeah.

1352
01:18:21,701 --> 01:18:23,994
You're gonna call me tonight?

1353
01:18:58,029 --> 01:19:00,531
You know, Stephanie, this got me fired.

1354
01:19:00,615 --> 01:19:02,449
- What?
- This got me fired.

1355
01:19:02,534 --> 01:19:06,453
You know, you couldn't do it on Sunday,
so, my boss, he fired me.

1356
01:19:06,538 --> 01:19:08,497
Well, I just wanted
to get everything in, you know,

1357
01:19:08,581 --> 01:19:10,457
so I could start fixing up
when I move in on Saturday.

1358
01:19:10,542 --> 01:19:11,667
Yeah.

1359
01:19:11,751 --> 01:19:14,753
Nobody bitched at my office.
I got the whole day off.

1360
01:19:16,923 --> 01:19:18,382
Hey, I'm sorry.

1361
01:19:18,466 --> 01:19:21,760
Oh, it's all right. No problem.
No big deal. I can handle it.

1362
01:20:23,948 --> 01:20:26,367
Yeah, come on in.

1363
01:20:26,451 --> 01:20:29,119
Now, put that over here.

1364
01:20:29,871 --> 01:20:31,038
Hey!

1365
01:20:31,956 --> 01:20:33,624
I thought you were
gonna be out of town.

1366
01:20:33,708 --> 01:20:35,626
I postponed the trip.

1367
01:20:39,130 --> 01:20:41,882
Jay, this is Tony Manero. He's a friend.

1368
01:20:41,966 --> 01:20:45,219
- Tony, this is Jay Langhart.
- Unspecified status.

1369
01:20:45,303 --> 01:20:47,221
How do you do?

1370
01:20:47,305 --> 01:20:49,848
Well, I've decided to leave you
all the furniture.

1371
01:20:49,933 --> 01:20:52,059
What, are you kidding?
You're not gonna take any of this stuff?

1372
01:20:52,143 --> 01:20:54,853
No, I'm gonna start fresh. What the hell,
you picked out most of it anyway.

1373
01:20:54,938 --> 01:20:57,523
- Well, super.
- Stephanie, I told you not to say <<super. >>

1374
01:20:57,607 --> 01:21:00,359
Nobody says <<super>> anymore.

1375
01:21:00,443 --> 01:21:03,696
Can I get you a beer? Glass of wine?

1376
01:21:03,780 --> 01:21:06,240
No, man, it's all right.

1377
01:21:06,324 --> 01:21:08,617
Hey, I read that book you told me to.
You know, the...

1378
01:21:08,702 --> 01:21:10,536
Kerr or the Lawson?

1379
01:21:10,620 --> 01:21:13,622
- The Kerr.
- Should have read the Lawson.

1380
01:21:14,958 --> 01:21:19,294
Listen, if I can help you guys move in,
you just say the word. Be glad to help.

1381
01:21:27,721 --> 01:21:30,097
I'll get the rest of the stuff.

1382
01:21:41,359 --> 01:21:43,652
Stephanie, who is that guy?

1383
01:21:43,737 --> 01:21:47,698
He's an arranger, a record producer.
He wants to do films.

1384
01:21:47,782 --> 01:21:50,534
He's gonna move now
to a more expensive apartment.

1385
01:21:50,618 --> 01:21:52,578
I met him at the agency.

1386
01:21:52,662 --> 01:21:54,830
He didn't want his wife
to know how much money he had

1387
01:21:54,914 --> 01:21:57,207
until the divorce was final.

1388
01:21:58,335 --> 01:21:59,501
Come on. Let's go.

1389
01:21:59,586 --> 01:22:03,464
I mean, who is he to you, Stephanie?
That's what I'm talking about.

1390
01:22:04,632 --> 01:22:07,551
He's a friend of mine, okay?
He's a friend.

1391
01:22:08,470 --> 01:22:11,555
And I was living with him
for a little while.

1392
01:22:11,639 --> 01:22:14,016
Are you in love with this man or what?
I mean, tell me the story.

1393
01:22:14,100 --> 01:22:17,311
- That's all I'm asking, is the story.
- No, I'm not. We had a thing.

1394
01:22:17,395 --> 01:22:19,605
You know?
It didn't work out, and it's over now,

1395
01:22:19,689 --> 01:22:21,815
and he's my friend, and he still likes me.

1396
01:22:21,900 --> 01:22:23,567
He likes you. He likes you to have...

1397
01:22:23,651 --> 01:22:25,944
To have you around for a quick piece
when he feels like it.

1398
01:22:26,029 --> 01:22:28,655
He helped me, man. You don't know
what it's like at that place.

1399
01:22:28,740 --> 01:22:31,116
It's crazy. You don't know shit!

1400
01:22:31,201 --> 01:22:35,120
You know? I didn't know how to do stuff,
so I'd go to him and I would ask him,

1401
01:22:35,205 --> 01:22:37,331
and he would tell me how to do things.

1402
01:22:37,415 --> 01:22:39,708
And then I'd go back to work
and everything would be all right.

1403
01:22:39,793 --> 01:22:41,669
Otherwise, I'd be walking around
like an idiot,

1404
01:22:41,753 --> 01:22:43,921
going, <<I don't know. I don't know.
I don't know. >>

1405
01:22:44,005 --> 01:22:46,006
- And he helps me. He does.
- Yeah, he helps you. Helps you what?

1406
01:22:46,091 --> 01:22:48,550
Get in and out of the sack?
Is that what he helps you do?

1407
01:22:48,635 --> 01:22:50,177
- He helped me.
- Sure.

1408
01:22:50,261 --> 01:22:52,554
What the hell do you
expect me to do, man?

1409
01:22:52,639 --> 01:22:55,641
What do you expect me to do?
He helped me.

1410
01:23:05,193 --> 01:23:07,903
Don't cry about it. I mean, you know.

1411
01:23:07,987 --> 01:23:11,031
All right, so he helped you.
That's good for you.

1412
01:23:14,828 --> 01:23:17,579
All right. Come on. Let's get out of here.

1413
01:23:18,540 --> 01:23:19,915
I'm sorry.

1414
01:23:21,543 --> 01:23:23,544
It's all right.
Don't worry about nothing.

1415
01:23:23,628 --> 01:23:26,714
Don't worry about that.
Don't worry about nothing.

1416
01:23:26,798 --> 01:23:28,549
Stephanie, don't.

1417
01:23:30,051 --> 01:23:32,469
Look, we'll stop here for a while.
We'll sit down. All right?

1418
01:23:32,554 --> 01:23:34,805
Don't stop. Just take me home.
Just take me home, man.

1419
01:23:34,889 --> 01:23:36,598
No, come on, we'll sit here
for a while, all right?

1420
01:23:36,683 --> 01:23:39,101
Just, don't worry about nothing.

1421
01:23:45,442 --> 01:23:47,359
It's pretty, isn't it?

1422
01:23:54,492 --> 01:23:55,951
Sit down.

1423
01:24:08,089 --> 01:24:10,299
You know how tall that bridge is?

1424
01:24:10,383 --> 01:24:13,886
That bridge, that tower right there,
goes up 690 feet.

1425
01:24:14,596 --> 01:24:18,015
They got 40 million cars
going across there a year.

1426
01:24:18,350 --> 01:24:22,644
127,000 tons of steel is involved in that.

1427
01:24:23,688 --> 01:24:24,938
The concrete there,

1428
01:24:25,023 --> 01:24:28,984
they got almost three-quarter
of a million yards of concrete.

1429
01:24:29,069 --> 01:24:30,194
That's right.

1430
01:24:30,278 --> 01:24:34,907
The center span, right there,
is 4,260 feet long.

1431
01:24:34,991 --> 01:24:37,743
And with the on-ramps,
it all together totals, like,

1432
01:24:37,827 --> 01:24:40,245
something like 2.5 miles.

1433
01:24:41,664 --> 01:24:44,083
You know all about the bridge,
don't you?

1434
01:24:44,167 --> 01:24:46,043
That's right.

1435
01:24:46,127 --> 01:24:48,504
I know everything about that bridge.

1436
01:24:48,588 --> 01:24:52,633
You know what else?
They got a guy buried in the cement.

1437
01:24:53,385 --> 01:24:54,885
Yeah?

1438
01:24:55,845 --> 01:24:57,930
Know how it happened?

1439
01:24:58,014 --> 01:25:00,432
Well, they was working on it,
apparently, at the time.

1440
01:25:00,517 --> 01:25:03,686
And they, I guess,
they were pouring the cement,

1441
01:25:03,770 --> 01:25:05,312
and he slipped off, you know,

1442
01:25:05,397 --> 01:25:09,400
on the upper part of the bridge
and, you know, fell in.

1443
01:25:12,237 --> 01:25:13,737
Dumb fuck.

1444
01:25:14,155 --> 01:25:16,365
- What a way to go.
- I come down here a lot.

1445
01:25:16,449 --> 01:25:18,450
You know, I get ideas.

1446
01:25:18,535 --> 01:25:21,161
Oh, yeah? What kind of ideas you get?

1447
01:25:21,830 --> 01:25:25,290
I don't know, daydreams, you know?
I daydream a lot.

1448
01:25:50,734 --> 01:25:53,152
Mr. Fusco, I come for what I got coming.

1449
01:25:53,236 --> 01:25:54,528
Tony. Come on.

1450
01:25:54,612 --> 01:25:57,156
Things got a little hot under the collar,
don't you think?

1451
01:25:57,240 --> 01:25:58,532
What are you talking about?

1452
01:25:58,616 --> 01:26:00,951
I don't want to lose you, Tony.
You're a good kid.

1453
01:26:01,036 --> 01:26:04,455
Customers like you.
I want you to stay on.

1454
01:26:04,539 --> 01:26:08,125
- You mean, I ain't fired?
- No. Come on. Here.

1455
01:26:08,209 --> 01:26:11,420
- Jesus Christ. I don't believe this.
- You got a future here, Tony.

1456
01:26:11,504 --> 01:26:14,506
Here, Harold's with me 18 years,
since I opened.

1457
01:26:14,591 --> 01:26:16,717
Mike, 15 years, huh?

1458
01:26:17,302 --> 01:26:20,721
Come on, now. Give Harold
a hand, huh? He's making a mess.

1459
01:26:37,864 --> 01:26:39,948
Pete, what are you doing?

1460
01:26:41,284 --> 01:26:43,202
Trying to get up to 70%?

1461
01:26:43,286 --> 01:26:46,955
Whoa, man.
I didn't know you hung your label on her.

1462
01:26:48,500 --> 01:26:49,750
What are you doing?

1463
01:26:49,834 --> 01:26:52,169
That guy's the biggest cunt hound
in Bay Ridge.

1464
01:26:52,253 --> 01:26:54,129
Oh, my God.
I've been in serious danger.

1465
01:26:54,214 --> 01:26:58,092
It's no fucking joke, Stephanie.
That guy's a fucking sleazy whore.

1466
01:26:59,969 --> 01:27:03,180
I was dancing with the fella.
You know? Dancing.

1467
01:27:03,264 --> 01:27:06,392
- No, no. No, forget it.
- Come on. Let's dance, huh?

1468
01:27:06,476 --> 01:27:08,727
You disgust me, you know that?

1469
01:27:08,812 --> 01:27:10,020
- Well, what do you mean?
- Forget it.

1470
01:27:10,105 --> 01:27:12,606
- Forget it.
- Tony, I was just dancing with the guy.

1471
01:27:13,942 --> 01:27:16,819
I don't want nobody, baby

1472
01:27:17,612 --> 01:27:18,987
Tony! Tony!

1473
01:27:19,072 --> 01:27:22,116
- Annette, what do you want?
- Just look. Look.

1474
01:27:27,205 --> 01:27:28,622
Oh, Jesus.

1475
01:27:30,500 --> 01:27:34,712
If I can't have you
I don't want nobody, baby

1476
01:27:34,796 --> 01:27:37,297
If I can't have you

1477
01:27:37,674 --> 01:27:39,675
Nobody
If I can't have you

1478
01:28:16,129 --> 01:28:19,506
Beautiful, man. They got six or seven
of them in there and a couple of chicks.

1479
01:28:19,591 --> 01:28:22,343
Listen, why don't we wait till they get
down to about three, four people?

1480
01:28:22,427 --> 01:28:23,761
- Yeah, one or two?
- Tony!

1481
01:28:23,845 --> 01:28:26,930
- All right. I'm thinking, I'm thinking.
- Tony, listen, you gotta help...

1482
01:28:27,015 --> 01:28:29,600
Shut up! Shut up!
- Back up, all right?

1483
01:28:29,684 --> 01:28:32,144
What are you doing?
What are you doing, Double J?

1484
01:28:32,228 --> 01:28:35,105
- Trying to back it up!
- What are you, crazy?

1485
01:28:36,024 --> 01:28:38,901
- Tony, I'm gonna get married.
- Shut up!

1486
01:28:40,695 --> 01:28:42,696
Come on, fuckers!

1487
01:28:57,754 --> 01:28:59,296
Tony!

1488
01:29:07,555 --> 01:29:11,308
Tony! Tony, help me! Please, God!

1489
01:29:19,025 --> 01:29:21,777
Hey, what the hell
you think you're doing, huh?

1490
01:29:48,304 --> 01:29:49,596
Ton!

1491
01:29:53,685 --> 01:29:56,854
Ton! Come here, it's me! Come on!

1492
01:29:56,938 --> 01:29:59,398
- Let's get out of here.
- You okay?

1493
01:30:03,278 --> 01:30:04,570
Jesus!

1494
01:30:07,490 --> 01:30:09,783
He chickened, man! Where is he?

1495
01:30:18,043 --> 01:30:19,668
Go, man! Go!

1496
01:30:23,590 --> 01:30:27,051
- Where the hell were you, huh?
- Tony, I was just driving around.

1497
01:30:27,135 --> 01:30:30,804
- Oh, Jesus Christ!
- I was looking for you. Where were you?

1498
01:30:39,314 --> 01:30:41,565
Hey, Gus. Did you get
the number of the truck that hit you?

1499
01:30:41,649 --> 01:30:43,609
Don't make me laugh, all right?
Do not make me laugh.

1500
01:30:43,693 --> 01:30:45,694
- Look at this. We don't love you, right?
- Right.

1501
01:30:45,779 --> 01:30:47,321
We got them.
- Does that hurt?

1502
01:30:47,405 --> 01:30:48,864
Yeah, really, huh?

1503
01:30:48,948 --> 01:30:51,617
Hey, you guys really, you know,
you really kicked their asses?

1504
01:30:51,701 --> 01:30:54,078
Hey, come on, we got them
where they breathe, Italian style.

1505
01:30:54,162 --> 01:30:55,496
Yeah, that's great, you know.

1506
01:30:55,580 --> 01:30:58,832
Only, you know,
I ain't so sure it was the Barracudas.

1507
01:30:58,917 --> 01:31:01,043
Dr. Allison to Emergency.

1508
01:31:07,133 --> 01:31:09,551
Hey, what are you talking about?
You said it was.

1509
01:31:09,636 --> 01:31:11,595
No, I said it probably was.

1510
01:31:11,680 --> 01:31:13,013
Don't be pulling our legs now.

1511
01:31:13,098 --> 01:31:16,016
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

1512
01:31:16,101 --> 01:31:18,143
- You said it probably was.
- Yeah, I said probably.

1513
01:31:18,228 --> 01:31:20,479
- That's what you told us.
- I said probably 'cause I wasn't sure.

1514
01:31:20,563 --> 01:31:22,648
You know? I mean,
it could've been a Spanish...

1515
01:31:22,732 --> 01:31:24,608
Stupid, fucking bastard.

1516
01:31:24,693 --> 01:31:29,071
- We almost got our heads busted.
- Yeah, not you, lover.

1517
01:31:39,582 --> 01:31:42,167
You know, you got some fucking pair
of balls on you, you know that, Gus?

1518
01:31:42,252 --> 01:31:43,335
- Hey, hey, come on.
- You know that?

1519
01:31:43,420 --> 01:31:46,422
Hey, you know, I had to say something.
Right? I had to lay somebody out for it.

1520
01:31:46,506 --> 01:31:48,590
What are you, stupid?
You can't see who hurt you, right?

1521
01:31:48,675 --> 01:31:49,883
Oh, my God, what are you doing?

1522
01:31:49,968 --> 01:31:52,219
If I said I didn't know who it was,
they would have got off. Come on.

1523
01:31:52,303 --> 01:31:53,971
Yeah, well, fuck you, Gus.
You know what I feel like doing?

1524
01:31:54,055 --> 01:31:56,598
I feel like breaking your broken leg.
That's what I feel like doing.

1525
01:31:56,683 --> 01:31:57,933
Hey, come on.
Let's get out of here.

1526
01:31:58,018 --> 01:32:00,644
Oh, God, I can't believe
this whole fucking thing.

1527
01:32:01,771 --> 01:32:03,731
You wanna know something?
I could have killed him.

1528
01:32:03,815 --> 01:32:05,190
You couldn't kill a fucking crab lice.

1529
01:32:05,275 --> 01:32:07,026
Oh, shit, what do you think I am?

1530
01:32:07,110 --> 01:32:09,611
- You think I'm a coward?
- What do you think you are?

1531
01:32:09,696 --> 01:32:11,488
Enough of that shit, already. I'm bored.

1532
01:32:11,573 --> 01:32:13,741
I'm bored with it, all right?

1533
01:32:27,339 --> 01:32:30,924
Hey, hey. Jeez, look at this.
You're beautiful, babe.

1534
01:32:31,009 --> 01:32:33,886
Hey, come on. We got the winners here.
Let's get a table. Let's go.

1535
01:32:33,970 --> 01:32:36,221
Yeah. Let's get a table.

1536
01:32:38,266 --> 01:32:40,934
- How you doing?
- I'm all right.

1537
01:32:42,896 --> 01:32:45,272
What happened to your face, huh?

1538
01:32:45,357 --> 01:32:47,316
I cut myself shaving.

1539
01:32:47,817 --> 01:32:49,777
With a switchblade, huh?

1540
01:32:49,861 --> 01:32:51,403
Come on.

1541
01:33:01,581 --> 01:33:03,957
Climb aboard my magic carpet

1542
01:33:04,042 --> 01:33:08,754
And let us take a ride to the oasis
Get down with the genie

1543
01:33:08,838 --> 01:33:13,008
FeeI the power and the spirit

1544
01:33:13,093 --> 01:33:15,427
Of the genie
Get down with the genie

1545
01:33:15,512 --> 01:33:18,430
Yeah! Come on! Do it!

1546
01:33:37,534 --> 01:33:40,077
Open sesame

1547
01:33:43,665 --> 01:33:46,250
Get down with the genie

1548
01:33:47,711 --> 01:33:49,712
Get down with the genie

1549
01:33:49,796 --> 01:33:52,172
A big hand
for Shirley and Charles Tuck.

1550
01:33:52,257 --> 01:33:54,591
Give them a big hand.
Come on, everybody.

1551
01:33:54,676 --> 01:33:57,553
What are you booing?
Come on, be cool, everybody

1552
01:33:57,637 --> 01:34:00,556
No way. No good. No way.

1553
01:34:00,640 --> 01:34:01,849
Yes!

1554
01:34:02,350 --> 01:34:05,310
Now we have Stephanie Manga no
and Tony Manero!

1555
01:34:06,104 --> 01:34:07,312
Come on.

1556
01:34:07,397 --> 01:34:08,814
All right.

1557
01:34:15,030 --> 01:34:16,947
Joey, hey, give me
another one of those, huh?

1558
01:34:17,032 --> 01:34:18,365
Hey, come on, you had enough.

1559
01:34:18,450 --> 01:34:19,908
Come on. I like it.
They're good. Come on.

1560
01:34:19,993 --> 01:34:21,952
All right. Get high.
You know, it's your head.

1561
01:34:22,037 --> 01:34:24,621
- That's right.
- Here you go.

1562
01:34:31,379 --> 01:34:34,465
Oh, girl, I've known you very well

1563
01:34:34,799 --> 01:34:39,178
I've seen you growing every day
I never really looked before

1564
01:34:39,429 --> 01:34:41,638
But now you take my breath away

1565
01:34:41,723 --> 01:34:45,768
Suddenly you're in my life
Part of everything I do

1566
01:34:45,852 --> 01:34:50,898
You got me working day and night
Just trying to keep a hold on you

1567
01:34:50,982 --> 01:34:55,027
Here in your arms
I found my paradise

1568
01:34:55,570 --> 01:34:59,323
My only chance for happiness

1569
01:35:00,241 --> 01:35:04,161
And if I lose you now
I think I would die

1570
01:35:04,245 --> 01:35:08,582
Oh, say you'll always be my baby
We can make it shine

1571
01:35:08,917 --> 01:35:13,671
We can take forever
just a minute at a time

1572
01:35:16,007 --> 01:35:18,425
More than a woman

1573
01:35:20,512 --> 01:35:23,180
More than a woman to me

1574
01:35:25,058 --> 01:35:27,434
More than a woman

1575
01:35:29,396 --> 01:35:32,940
More than a woman to me

1576
01:35:42,909 --> 01:35:47,788
There are stories old and true
Of people so in love like you and me

1577
01:35:47,872 --> 01:35:51,625
And I can see myself
Let history repeat itself

1578
01:35:51,710 --> 01:35:54,211
Reflecting how I feeI for you

1579
01:35:54,295 --> 01:35:56,296
Thinking about those people then

1580
01:35:56,381 --> 01:36:00,843
I know that in a thousand years
I'd fall in love with you again

1581
01:36:01,594 --> 01:36:05,055
This is the only way
That we should fly

1582
01:36:05,974 --> 01:36:08,642
This is the only way to go

1583
01:36:10,395 --> 01:36:14,356
And if I lose your love
I know I would die

1584
01:36:14,441 --> 01:36:18,861
Oh, say you'll always be my baby
We can make it shine

1585
01:36:19,362 --> 01:36:26,243
We can take forever
Just a minute at a time

1586
01:36:26,327 --> 01:36:28,746
More than a woman

1587
01:36:29,914 --> 01:36:33,792
You are
More than a woman to me

1588
01:36:35,378 --> 01:36:39,423
More than a woman
Baby

1589
01:36:39,716 --> 01:36:42,718
More than a woman to me

1590
01:36:55,857 --> 01:36:58,817
More than a woman

1591
01:37:00,445 --> 01:37:03,447
More than a woman to me

1592
01:37:05,075 --> 01:37:09,536
More than a woman
Baby

1593
01:37:09,621 --> 01:37:12,122
More than a woman to me

1594
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:16,919
More than a woman

1595
01:37:18,713 --> 01:37:21,382
More than a woman to me

1596
01:37:23,218 --> 01:37:26,095
More than a woman

1597
01:37:27,347 --> 01:37:30,766
More than a woman to me

1598
01:37:44,239 --> 01:37:46,657
Right on! That is the money.

1599
01:37:53,331 --> 01:37:56,583
Hey! Hey, be cooI, baby!

1600
01:37:56,668 --> 01:37:59,712
Here now, we have couple number 15,
the Puerto Ricans...

1601
01:38:11,474 --> 01:38:12,933
Wrong neighborhood, huh?

1602
01:38:13,018 --> 01:38:15,728
Tony, listen to me,
you're gonna take the prize.

1603
01:38:57,312 --> 01:38:59,188
Jesus Christ. They're so fucking good.

1604
01:38:59,272 --> 01:39:00,981
How could they be? They're spics.

1605
01:39:01,066 --> 01:39:03,442
Look at them greasing up the floor.

1606
01:39:55,161 --> 01:39:56,704
Numero uno!

1607
01:39:57,455 --> 01:39:59,123
No contest, man. No contest.

1608
01:39:59,207 --> 01:40:01,542
I don't want to hear that shit.
They was fucking better than us.

1609
01:40:01,626 --> 01:40:04,003
They weren't better, they was different,
that's all. Just different.

1610
01:40:04,087 --> 01:40:06,255
- Bullshit.
- All right, folks!

1611
01:40:06,339 --> 01:40:08,132
We have the decision of the judges.

1612
01:40:08,216 --> 01:40:11,343
In third place,
we have Elizabeth and Joseph Cursa!

1613
01:40:11,428 --> 01:40:14,346
Give them a hand!

1614
01:40:15,098 --> 01:40:16,306
Come on, baby.

1615
01:40:16,391 --> 01:40:17,474
Yeah!

1616
01:40:21,021 --> 01:40:22,521
Second prize!

1617
01:40:22,605 --> 01:40:26,316
From Puerto Rico, we have
Cesar Rodriguez, Maria Huerta!

1618
01:40:29,362 --> 01:40:32,906
- You're doing them a favor!
- They're gonna take the prize.

1619
01:40:33,867 --> 01:40:35,075
- Thank you.
Unbelievable!

1620
01:40:35,160 --> 01:40:37,369
- Don't spend it in one place, baby.
- Thank you.

1621
01:40:38,413 --> 01:40:40,873
In first place, the coolest,

1622
01:40:40,957 --> 01:40:42,875
the Fred Astaire of Brooklyn,
the boogie-woogie man,

1623
01:40:42,959 --> 01:40:45,461
the man who gave you coolness,
hotness and everything you wanted.

1624
01:40:45,545 --> 01:40:47,963
He was hot! He was right on!

1625
01:40:48,048 --> 01:40:50,674
Stephanie Mangano and Tony Manero.

1626
01:40:52,927 --> 01:40:54,345
We won.

1627
01:40:57,640 --> 01:40:59,933
Come on. Come on!

1628
01:41:03,355 --> 01:41:04,938
Didn't I tell you?

1629
01:41:09,152 --> 01:41:10,527
Won.

1630
01:41:12,447 --> 01:41:15,199
Well, you can tell
By the way I use my walk

1631
01:41:15,283 --> 01:41:17,993
I'm a woman's man
No time to talk

1632
01:41:19,120 --> 01:41:20,954
Come on, let's boogie.
Come on, everybody.

1633
01:41:21,039 --> 01:41:24,583
It's over. Come on, let's dance.
Come on, everybody!

1634
01:41:25,043 --> 01:41:27,461
And you may look the other way

1635
01:41:27,545 --> 01:41:29,630
And we can try
To understand

1636
01:41:29,714 --> 01:41:32,049
The New York Times' effect on man

1637
01:41:32,133 --> 01:41:34,927
Man, you put them down,
is what you did, huh?

1638
01:41:35,011 --> 01:41:36,512
You phony bastards!

1639
01:41:36,596 --> 01:41:38,847
You know who should have won
that contest.

1640
01:41:38,932 --> 01:41:41,058
My own fucking friends
can't even be straight with me.

1641
01:41:41,142 --> 01:41:43,060
You gotta lie
right through your fucking teeth.

1642
01:41:43,144 --> 01:41:44,895
- Come on!
- What's up your ass, man?

1643
01:41:44,979 --> 01:41:47,981
- Look, we won it.
- Stephanie, that was rigged.

1644
01:41:48,066 --> 01:41:50,609
That's like family. They can't give it
to no spic or no stranger.

1645
01:41:50,694 --> 01:41:51,819
What are you, crazy?

1646
01:41:51,903 --> 01:41:54,822
We was just as good
as they were, Tony, and I know it.

1647
01:41:54,906 --> 01:41:57,032
- Oh, you think so, huh?
- Yeah!

1648
01:41:59,577 --> 01:42:02,204
Here. Come with me.

1649
01:42:03,540 --> 01:42:06,875
Excuse me. Congratulations. Here.

1650
01:42:06,960 --> 01:42:08,585
I'd like to give this,
I'd like to give you that,

1651
01:42:08,670 --> 01:42:11,171
'cause I think you deserve it, all right?
Come on.

1652
01:42:12,048 --> 01:42:14,800
God damn it! Good is good.
If the spics are good, they deserve it.

1653
01:42:14,884 --> 01:42:16,844
- That's all there is to it.
- Yeah, but we won it. They didn't.

1654
01:42:16,928 --> 01:42:19,638
This is a fucking shit hole,
you know that? A fucking shit hole!

1655
01:42:19,723 --> 01:42:22,474
God damn it.
My friends, the assholes I hang out with,

1656
01:42:22,559 --> 01:42:25,019
I can't believe them sometimes.
You know that?

1657
01:42:25,103 --> 01:42:28,063
Everybody's gotta dump
on somebody, right? Of course.

1658
01:42:28,148 --> 01:42:30,733
I mean, everybody...
Everybody can't do it straight, right?

1659
01:42:30,817 --> 01:42:32,818
My pa goes to work,
he gets dumped on,

1660
01:42:32,902 --> 01:42:34,695
so he comes home
and he dumps on my mother, right?

1661
01:42:34,779 --> 01:42:36,780
Of course, right?
Then the spics, they dump on us,

1662
01:42:36,865 --> 01:42:38,949
so we gotta dump on spics.
Of course, right?

1663
01:42:39,034 --> 01:42:41,618
Everybody's dumping on everybody.

1664
01:42:41,745 --> 01:42:44,246
Even the humping's dumping
most of the time.

1665
01:42:44,330 --> 01:42:47,666
All right. Okay. Listen, would you just
tell me what's wrong? Okay?

1666
01:42:47,751 --> 01:42:48,959
- Get in.
- What is it?

1667
01:42:49,044 --> 01:42:51,128
- Get in!
- Just tell me.

1668
01:42:58,303 --> 01:43:00,721
What the hell is wrong with you?

1669
01:43:06,561 --> 01:43:09,855
Wait. Stop it. Look, just stop it!

1670
01:43:09,939 --> 01:43:12,649
Let me alone, man!
Come on. Get away!

1671
01:43:12,734 --> 01:43:14,651
You know, you're such
a fucking cockteaser, you know that?

1672
01:43:14,736 --> 01:43:16,528
Don't you fucking call me
no goddamn cockteaser!

1673
01:43:16,613 --> 01:43:17,738
You are a cockteaser!

1674
01:43:17,822 --> 01:43:19,656
- Why you hanging around with me?
- Dancing, that's why.

1675
01:43:19,741 --> 01:43:21,533
- Oh, dancing, huh? Why else?
- Yeah!

1676
01:43:21,618 --> 01:43:24,078
You wanna know?
It's bullshit, that's why. Bullshit, man.

1677
01:43:24,162 --> 01:43:26,663
I've just been
dumping my bullshit all over you,

1678
01:43:26,748 --> 01:43:28,040
selling my act on you,

1679
01:43:28,124 --> 01:43:30,334
using you,
making you think that I love you!

1680
01:43:30,418 --> 01:43:32,252
It's just all bullshit, man!

1681
01:43:32,337 --> 01:43:36,298
- You fucking cunt!
- Don't fucking start! You stop it! Don't!

1682
01:43:38,093 --> 01:43:39,134
Get off of me.

1683
01:43:40,970 --> 01:43:42,513
Oh, Stephanie.

1684
01:43:59,030 --> 01:44:01,156
- I'm mad at you, Tony.
- Hey, Tony, come on.

1685
01:44:01,241 --> 01:44:03,200
Annette's gonna give everybody
a piece of snatch pie.

1686
01:44:03,284 --> 01:44:04,493
Yeah.

1687
01:44:04,869 --> 01:44:07,371
Oh, yeah? The fuck you are.
I wanna talk to you.

1688
01:44:07,455 --> 01:44:09,748
- Hey, what are you doing?
- What is with you, huh?

1689
01:44:09,833 --> 01:44:12,126
- What's with you, you little punk?
- What are you doing?

1690
01:44:12,210 --> 01:44:15,754
- What is it, man? What the fuck is it?
- You don't give a shit about her!

1691
01:44:18,758 --> 01:44:21,010
Come on, Annette. Get in the car.

1692
01:44:29,602 --> 01:44:31,812
Come on. Do it.

1693
01:44:37,360 --> 01:44:40,154
I told you.
You can fuck all night on this speed.

1694
01:44:40,238 --> 01:44:41,447
Oh, yeah?
Yeah, you will.

1695
01:44:41,531 --> 01:44:43,574
Joey, what you doing back there?

1696
01:44:43,658 --> 01:44:45,576
Hey, you fuck.
The first is always the best.

1697
01:44:45,660 --> 01:44:47,244
That's right.

1698
01:44:55,837 --> 01:44:57,671
Yes. Yes.

1699
01:44:58,840 --> 01:45:00,215
Joey?

1700
01:45:02,093 --> 01:45:03,385
Oh, God.

1701
01:45:08,391 --> 01:45:11,602
Come on, Double J. You're up.

1702
01:45:11,686 --> 01:45:13,729
See you guys later, huh?

1703
01:45:16,900 --> 01:45:19,443
No. Joey.
Come on, mother.

1704
01:45:19,694 --> 01:45:21,403
- Oh, yeah! My turn.
No. You know what?

1705
01:45:21,488 --> 01:45:24,573
No, Double J. No, I don't wanna do it.

1706
01:45:29,704 --> 01:45:31,455
Fuck-A!

1707
01:45:34,125 --> 01:45:36,585
Shit. With me she's gotta cry?

1708
01:45:36,670 --> 01:45:40,297
- God damn, Annette. Come on.
No. No. Don't.

1709
01:45:40,382 --> 01:45:41,840
Come on.

1710
01:45:52,602 --> 01:45:53,811
Yeah!

1711
01:45:58,692 --> 01:46:01,110
Fuck! Double J!

1712
01:46:01,194 --> 01:46:03,696
Come on, Double J! Come on!

1713
01:46:09,744 --> 01:46:13,789
- Give me a beer huh?
- Hey! Hey! With no pants.

1714
01:46:13,873 --> 01:46:15,708
And no hands!

1715
01:46:16,668 --> 01:46:18,127
Here, beer.

1716
01:46:20,714 --> 01:46:23,132
All right!
All right.

1717
01:46:23,383 --> 01:46:26,510
Fuck you, Manhattan!
Come to Brooklyn!

1718
01:46:30,557 --> 01:46:32,808
Mine's so big, I gotta strap it to my leg.

1719
01:46:32,892 --> 01:46:35,644
Anita says
I got the biggest thing in town.

1720
01:46:36,771 --> 01:46:38,689
Proud of yourself now?

1721
01:46:39,524 --> 01:46:42,526
Is that what you wanted? Good.

1722
01:46:44,487 --> 01:46:46,238
Now you're a cunt.

1723
01:46:47,699 --> 01:46:50,534
Man, don't fuck around.
What are you doing?

1724
01:46:53,413 --> 01:46:55,581
Where you going? Annette.

1725
01:47:01,504 --> 01:47:04,089
No. No. No. Leave me.

1726
01:47:07,719 --> 01:47:09,845
Come on, Annette. I'm sorry.

1727
01:47:11,639 --> 01:47:15,517
- Annette, I said I'm sorry.
- I didn't want to do it.

1728
01:47:17,479 --> 01:47:18,854
Look at this guy.

1729
01:47:18,938 --> 01:47:20,981
Hey, Bobby! Hey, you punk!

1730
01:47:21,066 --> 01:47:23,734
Tony! Look at me!

1731
01:47:23,818 --> 01:47:27,363
- Look at the punk.
- Bobby, get down. It's too dangerous.

1732
01:47:27,447 --> 01:47:32,284
Look at me, Tony.
Hey, Tony, look at me!

1733
01:47:32,369 --> 01:47:34,495
Look! Hey, Tony!

1734
01:47:36,164 --> 01:47:38,374
I'm not kidding, Bobby.
Get down from there.

1735
01:47:38,458 --> 01:47:40,709
I'm all right. I'm all right.

1736
01:47:41,878 --> 01:47:45,381
I'm all right, Tony.
I'm all right. Watch me.

1737
01:47:53,723 --> 01:47:57,142
- Hey, Tony, look at me!
- That's crazy. Now you're being crazy.

1738
01:47:57,227 --> 01:47:59,228
Look at me, look at me, look at me.
I'm doing it.

1739
01:47:59,312 --> 01:48:00,562
- It's too dangerous.
- Look at me.

1740
01:48:00,647 --> 01:48:02,523
I see you.
- Look at me.

1741
01:48:04,025 --> 01:48:05,484
Oh, Jesus.

1742
01:48:08,488 --> 01:48:10,906
It's a long way down there.

1743
01:48:12,450 --> 01:48:14,493
- Give me your hand.
- I did it!

1744
01:48:14,577 --> 01:48:16,995
Come back. Come back in. Come on.

1745
01:48:19,457 --> 01:48:20,791
- Watch.
- Don't, don't.

1746
01:48:20,875 --> 01:48:23,585
You're making me
very nervous now, Bobby.

1747
01:48:23,670 --> 01:48:25,838
Don't do that. Jesus Christ.

1748
01:48:25,922 --> 01:48:29,842
Get over here. Get over here, right now!
Give me your hand.

1749
01:48:31,094 --> 01:48:33,762
Oh, Jesus! No. No!

1750
01:48:33,847 --> 01:48:36,223
- Oh, come on.
I did it.

1751
01:48:36,307 --> 01:48:39,101
What did you do?
- I did it.

1752
01:48:39,185 --> 01:48:40,436
Watch.

1753
01:48:44,357 --> 01:48:47,151
Come on, Bobby. Get over here.
Right now. Come on.

1754
01:48:47,235 --> 01:48:48,986
Now, don't get upset.
Come on. We'll talk.

1755
01:48:49,070 --> 01:48:51,071
We'll go talk in the car.
It's warmer there.

1756
01:48:51,156 --> 01:48:53,449
You didn't talk to me before.

1757
01:48:54,701 --> 01:48:57,077
How come you never called me?

1758
01:49:00,165 --> 01:49:02,541
I didn't wanna fuck up.
You didn't fuck up, Bobby.

1759
01:49:02,625 --> 01:49:06,795
- Come on. We'll talk, all right?
- I didn't wanna fuck up this time.

1760
01:49:12,635 --> 01:49:17,556
Oh, God! Oh, God!
Oh, God! Oh, God!

1761
01:49:28,026 --> 01:49:29,234
No!

1762
01:49:40,789 --> 01:49:43,749
Any of you guys think
maybe he killed himself?

1763
01:49:43,833 --> 01:49:45,042
No.

1764
01:49:49,381 --> 01:49:52,299
There's ways of killing yourself
without killing yourself.

1765
01:49:52,384 --> 01:49:55,719
Yeah. Okay, you can go now.

1766
01:50:01,643 --> 01:50:02,851
Forget the number, Chief.

1767
01:50:02,936 --> 01:50:05,771
We ain't gonna find nothing
out there tonight.

1768
01:50:09,067 --> 01:50:10,234
Shit.

1769
01:50:24,582 --> 01:50:25,624
Ton?

1770
01:50:26,501 --> 01:50:27,876
Hey, Tony!

1771
01:51:40,408 --> 01:51:44,453
I know your eyes in the morning sun

1772
01:51:44,537 --> 01:51:49,166
I feeI you touch me in the pouring rain

1773
01:51:49,459 --> 01:51:53,921
And the moment
That you wander far from me

1774
01:51:54,005 --> 01:51:58,092
I wanna feeI you in my arms again

1775
01:51:58,593 --> 01:52:03,138
And you come to me
On a summer breeze

1776
01:52:03,223 --> 01:52:07,976
Keep me warm in your love
Then you softly leave

1777
01:52:08,061 --> 01:52:11,313
And it's me you need to show

1778
01:52:11,690 --> 01:52:13,440
How deep is your love

1779
01:52:13,525 --> 01:52:17,695
How deep is your love
How deep is your love

1780
01:52:17,821 --> 01:52:21,490
I really need to learn

1781
01:52:21,574 --> 01:52:25,953
'Cause we're living in a world of fools

1782
01:52:26,037 --> 01:52:28,539
Breaking us down

1783
01:52:28,623 --> 01:52:32,084
When they all should let us be

1784
01:52:35,672 --> 01:52:37,006
Stephanie?

1785
01:52:39,801 --> 01:52:42,428
- Is that you?
- Yeah, it's me, Stephanie.

1786
01:52:42,512 --> 01:52:44,680
Hey, look, look,
I'm really sorry about last night.

1787
01:52:44,764 --> 01:52:48,100
- You're sorry?
- Yeah, I'm sorry, Stephanie. I just...

1788
01:52:48,184 --> 01:52:50,894
Look, it won't happen again,
I promise you.

1789
01:52:50,979 --> 01:52:52,896
I just... I just, I really need to talk to you.

1790
01:52:52,981 --> 01:52:55,774
What are you talking about,
you need to talk to me?

1791
01:52:55,859 --> 01:52:58,777
It's just like what I said.
I need to talk to you.

1792
01:53:00,947 --> 01:53:02,781
Okay, listen. Now, if I open this door,

1793
01:53:02,866 --> 01:53:05,117
you're not gonna pull
any funny stuff on me, right?

1794
01:53:05,201 --> 01:53:06,994
No, of course not.

1795
01:53:18,340 --> 01:53:21,050
First time I ever let a known rapist
in my apartment.

1796
01:53:21,134 --> 01:53:24,136
Hey, look, I'll just stay right here,
all right?

1797
01:53:24,220 --> 01:53:28,515
So, that way you don't think that I'm
gonna, you know, jump you or nothing.

1798
01:53:31,394 --> 01:53:33,562
What's wrong with you, man?

1799
01:53:37,734 --> 01:53:39,902
Nothing. I'll tell you later. Right?

1800
01:53:42,072 --> 01:53:45,866
Well, you can't just stand there.
This is ridiculous. Come on.

1801
01:53:49,079 --> 01:53:51,580
I've been up all night
just walking and looking around.

1802
01:53:51,706 --> 01:53:54,833
And, you know,
I'm gonna get myself my own place.

1803
01:53:54,918 --> 01:53:56,168
You know what I'm gonna do?

1804
01:53:56,252 --> 01:53:57,920
I'm getting my money,
I'm coming back, you know.

1805
01:53:58,004 --> 01:53:59,254
'Cause I ain't going back there.

1806
01:53:59,339 --> 01:54:02,716
Wait a minute. Why don't you sit down,
okay? Come on.

1807
01:54:06,554 --> 01:54:09,264
- So, what are you doing?
- What am I doing?

1808
01:54:09,391 --> 01:54:12,685
I'm just not going back there, that's all.
They're assholes back there.

1809
01:54:12,769 --> 01:54:15,020
- I'm fed up to here with it. It's bullshit.
- Okay. Okay.

1810
01:54:15,105 --> 01:54:16,855
What are you gonna do?

1811
01:54:16,940 --> 01:54:19,108
What do you do?
You come in. You get a job. You know.

1812
01:54:19,192 --> 01:54:21,110
Do what you do. Get a nice apartment.

1813
01:54:21,236 --> 01:54:23,362
Okay, what kind of job?

1814
01:54:25,115 --> 01:54:26,949
I don't know.

1815
01:54:27,075 --> 01:54:29,118
What did you do? You came in,
you couldn't do nothing, right?

1816
01:54:29,244 --> 01:54:31,412
I could type when I came.

1817
01:54:33,623 --> 01:54:37,042
No big deal. I'm an able person.
I mean, I can do these things.

1818
01:54:37,127 --> 01:54:39,211
Yeah, of course you can.

1819
01:54:41,548 --> 01:54:44,133
Tony, I wanna tell you something.

1820
01:54:45,051 --> 01:54:48,387
Now, you know, I said
all that stuff to you about...

1821
01:54:49,305 --> 01:54:52,641
Using you,
practicing my act on you, you know?

1822
01:54:53,309 --> 01:54:54,810
It wasn't true.

1823
01:54:54,894 --> 01:54:58,147
There's a lot of other reasons
that I was hanging around you.

1824
01:54:58,231 --> 01:55:01,483
- What do you mean?
- You made me feel better.

1825
01:55:03,069 --> 01:55:06,447
You gave me, like, admiration,
you know? Respect.

1826
01:55:07,490 --> 01:55:08,824
Support.

1827
01:55:13,413 --> 01:55:17,750
Stephanie, maybe now that, you know,
like, I'm gonna be in town like I planned,

1828
01:55:17,834 --> 01:55:20,586
maybe, like, we could see each other.

1829
01:55:21,838 --> 01:55:25,007
No, I don't mean like that.
I know what you're thinking.

1830
01:55:25,133 --> 01:55:27,926
You're thinking, like,
I'm promoting your pussy, but I ain't.

1831
01:55:28,011 --> 01:55:29,678
I mean, like, friends, right?

1832
01:55:29,804 --> 01:55:33,015
You know, like you once said,
we could help each other.

1833
01:55:33,099 --> 01:55:36,852
- Wanna be friends?
- Yeah. I'd like to be friends with you.

1834
01:55:39,147 --> 01:55:41,607
Think you know how, huh?

1835
01:55:41,691 --> 01:55:43,442
Think you could be friends with a girl?

1836
01:55:43,526 --> 01:55:46,487
Could you stand
being friends with a girl, huh?

1837
01:55:47,447 --> 01:55:48,781
- The truth?
- Yeah.

1838
01:55:48,865 --> 01:55:49,948
I don't know.

1839
01:55:51,326 --> 01:55:52,451
I don't know. I mean, I could try.

1840
01:55:52,535 --> 01:55:55,371
That's all I can say, Stephanie.
I could try.

1841
01:56:01,461 --> 01:56:03,504
Okay. Okay.

1842
01:56:04,547 --> 01:56:07,883
Let's be friends, all right?
We'll just be friends.

1843
01:56:09,177 --> 01:56:10,552
All right.

1844
01:56:11,638 --> 01:56:13,806
Okay.

1845
01:56:17,352 --> 01:56:18,852
Friends, man.

1846
01:56:20,063 --> 01:56:24,233
I know your eyes in the morning sun

1847
01:56:24,317 --> 01:56:28,028
I feeI you touch me in the pouring rain

1848
01:56:29,322 --> 01:56:33,909
And the moment
That you wander far from me

1849
01:56:33,993 --> 01:56:38,414
I wanna feeI you in my arms again

1850
01:56:38,540 --> 01:56:42,918
And you come to me
On a summer breeze

1851
01:56:43,044 --> 01:56:47,673
Keep me warm in your love
Then you softly leave

1852
01:56:47,757 --> 01:56:51,593
And it's me you need to show

1853
01:56:51,678 --> 01:56:53,012
How deep is your love

1854
01:56:53,096 --> 01:56:57,599
How deep is your love
How deep is your love

1855
01:56:57,684 --> 01:57:01,103
I really need to learn

1856
01:57:01,229 --> 01:57:05,607
'Cause we're living in a world of fools

1857
01:57:05,734 --> 01:57:08,444
Breaking us down

1858
01:57:08,570 --> 01:57:12,114
When they all should let us be

1859
01:57:13,074 --> 01:57:16,785
We belong to you and me

1860
01:57:16,911 --> 01:57:19,371
I believe in you

1861
01:57:19,456 --> 01:57:24,376
You know the door to my very souI

1862
01:57:24,544 --> 01:57:29,131
You're the light
In my deepest, darkest hour

1863
01:57:29,257 --> 01:57:32,968
You're my savior when I fall

1864
01:57:33,928 --> 01:57:38,307
And you may not think
I care for you

1865
01:57:38,433 --> 01:57:43,145
When you know down inside
That I really do

1866
01:57:43,229 --> 01:57:46,732
And it's me you need to show

1867
01:57:47,150 --> 01:57:48,484
How deep is your love

1868
01:57:48,568 --> 01:57:52,988
How deep is your love
How deep is your love

1869
01:57:53,073 --> 01:57:55,491
Well, you can tell
By the way I use my walk

1870
01:57:55,617 --> 01:57:57,993
I'm a woman's man
No time to talk

1871
01:57:58,119 --> 01:58:00,079
Music loud
And women warm

1872
01:58:00,163 --> 01:58:02,748
I've been kicked around
Since I was born

1873
01:58:02,832 --> 01:58:05,000
And now it's all right
It's okay

1874
01:58:05,126 --> 01:58:07,503
You may look the other way

1875
01:58:07,629 --> 01:58:09,922
And we can try
To understand

1876
01:58:10,006 --> 01:58:12,257
The New York Times' effect on man

1877
01:58:12,342 --> 01:58:14,426
Whether you're a brother
Or whether you're a mother

1878
01:58:14,511 --> 01:58:16,929
You're stayin' alive
Stayin' alive

1879
01:58:17,013 --> 01:58:19,098
FeeI the city breaking
And everybody shaking

1880
01:58:19,182 --> 01:58:21,517
And we're stayin' alive
Stayin' alive

1881
01:58:23,770 --> 01:58:26,281
Stayin' alive

1882
01:58:42,205 --> 01:58:44,790
Well, now, I get low
And I get high

1883
01:58:44,874 --> 01:58:47,209
And if I can't get either
I really try

1884
01:58:47,335 --> 01:58:49,294
Got the wings of heaven
On my shoes

1885
01:58:49,379 --> 01:58:51,797
I'm a dancing man
And I just can't lose

1886
01:58:51,881 --> 01:58:54,049
You know it's all right
It's okay

1887
01:58:54,175 --> 01:58:56,552
I'll live to see another day

1888
01:58:56,678 --> 01:58:58,721
We can try
To understand

1889
01:58:58,847 --> 01:59:00,681
The New York Times' effect on man
