1
00:01:06,108 --> 00:01:07,859
Inside a snowflake,

2
00:01:07,943 --> 00:01:10,111
like the one on your sleeve,

3
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:14,323
there happened a story
you must see to believe.

4
00:01:31,008 --> 00:01:34,761
Way up in the mountains,
in the high range of Pontoos,

5
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:37,096
lay the small town
of Whoville,

6
00:01:38,307 --> 00:01:40,141
the home of the Whos!

7
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:47,315
Ask any Who,
and they'll have this to say...

8
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:51,527
There is no place
like Whoville
around Christmas Day.

9
00:01:52,362 --> 00:01:55,323
Every window was flocked,
every lamppost was dressed,

10
00:01:55,407 --> 00:01:59,744
and the Whoville Band marched
in their Christmas-y best.

11
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:07,460
Merry Christmas!
Merry Christmas!

12
00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:23,476
Arbor Day was fine,
and Easter was pleasant,

13
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:26,896
and every Saint Fizzin's Day
they ate a Fizz pheasant,

14
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:30,858
but every Who knew,
from their 12 toes
to their snout,

15
00:02:30,943 --> 00:02:33,152
they loved Christmas the most,

16
00:02:33,237 --> 00:02:35,363
without a single Who doubt.

17
00:02:40,077 --> 00:02:42,328
Farfingle's welcomes you!
Thank you.

18
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:45,915
Merry Christmas! Thank you
for shopping Farfingle's!

19
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:48,876
We got a snoozlephone

20
00:02:48,961 --> 00:02:51,587
and a snoozlephone
for your brother Stu,

21
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:55,132

22
00:02:55,217 --> 00:02:57,677
and a fandpa
for your Cousin Leon.

23
00:02:58,011 --> 00:03:00,221
So, we just need... Cindy?

24
00:03:00,305 --> 00:03:01,597
Sale on aisle three!

25
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:03,683
Cindy Lou! Cin... Oh.
Merry Christmas!

26
00:03:03,767 --> 00:03:05,518
Oh, hello, Myrna.
Merry Christmas, Fred.

27
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:08,312
Excuse me one minute.
Cindy Lou? Honey?

28
00:03:09,314 --> 00:03:10,356
Dad?
Yeah?

29
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,650
Doesn't this seem
like a bit much?

30
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:16,529
This is what
Christmas is all about!
Can't you feel it?

31
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:18,072
Merry Christmas!

32
00:03:18,156 --> 00:03:20,658
Thank you for shopping Farf...
Wait a second!

33
00:03:20,742 --> 00:03:23,119
Don't forget your change!
Another minute
closer to Christmas!

34
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:30,167
For the next five minutes
only, 99% off!

35
00:03:42,764 --> 00:03:47,476
Yes, every Who
down in Whoville
liked Christmas a lot,

36
00:03:47,978 --> 00:03:51,772
but the Grinch, who lived
just north of Whoville,

37
00:03:52,733 --> 00:03:53,983
did not.

38
00:03:57,362 --> 00:03:59,697
Hi, girls. All the
good mistletoe's at the top.

39
00:03:59,781 --> 00:04:01,908
Hey, girls!
I'll race you!

40
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:06,829
Not if I race you first.
Last one to the top's
a stinky old Grinch!

41
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:10,583
You guys,
where are we?

42
00:04:10,918 --> 00:04:15,171
I think we should go back.
What? You're scared
of the Grinch!

43
00:04:15,464 --> 00:04:19,342
No!
They say he lives up here
in a big cave.

44
00:04:19,635 --> 00:04:22,511
And he only comes down
when he's hungry
for the taste of

45
00:04:22,638 --> 00:04:24,263
Who flesh!
Oh, Drew!

46
00:04:24,348 --> 00:04:27,558
Guys!
You're scared
of the Grinch!

47
00:04:27,643 --> 00:04:29,435
You're scared of the Grinch!

48
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:31,729
Are too!

49
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:33,439
Am not!
Are too!

50
00:04:35,901 --> 00:04:37,318
Wait for me!

51
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:50,623
Can we touch it?
Touch the door?

52
00:04:50,874 --> 00:04:52,541
Do it for me, Stu.

53
00:04:59,174 --> 00:05:00,299
Drew?

54
00:05:24,908 --> 00:05:26,659
Well done, Max!

55
00:05:27,411 --> 00:05:30,121
Serves them right,
those yuletide-loving

56
00:05:30,414 --> 00:05:33,749
sickly-sweet, nog-sucking
cheer mongers!

57
00:05:35,419 --> 00:05:39,880
I really don't like 'em.
No, I don't.

58
00:05:43,218 --> 00:05:44,301
Max!

59
00:05:46,221 --> 00:05:48,431
Get my cloak!

60
00:05:49,433 --> 00:05:52,810
I've been much too tolerant
of these
"Who-venile" delinquents

61
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:55,563
and their innocent,
victimless pranks.

62
00:05:56,648 --> 00:05:59,400
So, they wanna get to know me,
do they?

63
00:06:00,027 --> 00:06:03,612
They want to spend a little
quality time with the Grinch.

64
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:09,035
I guess I could use
a little social interaction.

65
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:20,046
Merry Christmas!

66
00:06:20,172 --> 00:06:23,632
Oh, yeah, you bet.
Ho, ho, ho, and stuff.

67
00:06:27,137 --> 00:06:30,514
Oh, my. Someone has
vandalized that vehicle.

68
00:06:30,974 --> 00:06:33,809
You see, Max?
The city is a dangerous place.

69
00:06:33,894 --> 00:06:36,645
The Grinch hated Christmas,
the whole Christmas season.

70
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:37,897
Top of the day, flatfoot.

71
00:06:37,981 --> 00:06:41,358
Now, please, don't ask why.
No one quite knows the reason.

72
00:06:41,443 --> 00:06:42,902
Hey, kids.
Here's a present for ya.

73
00:06:42,986 --> 00:06:46,405
Be sure to run real fast
with it, now. Come on.
Double time. Let's go. Move.

74
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:49,200
It could be that his head
wasn't screwed on just right,

75
00:06:49,493 --> 00:06:52,828
or it could be, perhaps,
that his shoes were too tight.

76
00:06:52,913 --> 00:06:54,747
But I think that the most
likely reason of all...

77
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:55,873
Merry Christmas!
Idiot.

78
00:06:55,957 --> 00:07:00,044
...may have been
that his heart
was two sizes too small.

79
00:07:00,337 --> 00:07:03,839
Hey, stranger,
won't let you go
till you buy a chapeau!

80
00:07:12,015 --> 00:07:15,476
The streets are filled
with Christmas cheer

81
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:18,145
Boy, nothing beats Christmas,
right?

82
00:07:18,522 --> 00:07:19,814
I guess.

83
00:07:20,524 --> 00:07:22,775
You guess?
Well, it's just

84
00:07:22,859 --> 00:07:26,862
I look around at you and Mom
and everyone getting
all kerbobbled.

85
00:07:27,239 --> 00:07:29,907
Doesn't this seem superfluous?

86
00:07:29,991 --> 00:07:33,828
Lou! Lou!

87
00:07:36,081 --> 00:07:39,250
What happened to you?
It was too Grinch!

88
00:07:44,506 --> 00:07:46,924
Grinch?
What do you want? I mean...

89
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:48,926
Grinch? Oh, no!

90
00:07:50,053 --> 00:07:53,013
Did someone just say,
"Grinch"?

91
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:55,975
Hello, Mayor May Who, sir.

92
00:07:58,812 --> 00:07:59,895
Lou?

93
00:08:04,109 --> 00:08:06,819
I don't need to remind you
that this Christmas marks

94
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:09,655
the one thousandth
Whobilation.

95
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:14,660
Whoville's most
important celebration!
And The Book of Who says,

96
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:16,245
very clearly,

97
00:08:17,372 --> 00:08:19,665
"Every size of
Who we can measure

98
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:23,711
"knows that Whobilation is
a time we must treasure!"

99
00:08:23,795 --> 00:08:26,922
Now, Lou, please
tell me that your boys

100
00:08:27,257 --> 00:08:29,175
were not up on Mount Crumpit

101
00:08:29,259 --> 00:08:33,095
provoking the one creature
within a billion bilometers
of here

102
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:35,848
who hates Christmas!
But it was the Grinch!

103
00:08:37,267 --> 00:08:40,561
No, no, no, no sir,
the boys didn't see
any Grinch.

104
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:45,024
They just... I think they were
up on the mountain

105
00:08:45,108 --> 00:08:47,693
playing with matches,
or defacing public property,
or...

106
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:49,111
Oh, well.

107
00:08:49,738 --> 00:08:51,405
That's a relief.

108
00:08:51,489 --> 00:08:56,452
All right, you heard the man,
there's no Grinch problem
here.

109
00:09:04,628 --> 00:09:06,212
Lou, I need it there
by tomorrow.

110
00:09:06,296 --> 00:09:07,880
Heckuvarush.

111
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:10,424
Merry Christmas, Mo.
Next in line.

112
00:09:13,511 --> 00:09:16,680
But, Dad. I just don't
understand something.

113
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:19,642
Why won't anyone talk
about the Grinch?

114
00:09:20,185 --> 00:09:22,144
You kids and the Grinch!

115
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:26,649
You see, Cindy, the Grinch
is a Who who always...

116
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:30,653
Actually, not a Who,
he's more of a...

117
00:09:30,737 --> 00:09:33,822
A what?
Exactly, honey.

118
00:09:34,199 --> 00:09:37,409
And he's a What
who doesn't like Christmas.

119
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:39,912
Take a look at his mailbox,
sweetie.

120
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:43,958
Not a single Christmas card,
in or out, ever!

121
00:09:44,793 --> 00:09:48,254
But why?
Lou, where's my mail?
Lou!

122
00:09:48,338 --> 00:09:52,591
Got the wrong mail here.
Lou! I got the wrong mail!

123
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:57,137
- I'll be right there.
- Lou, we got a problem!

124
00:09:57,222 --> 00:09:59,640
All right,
we'll straighten this out.

125
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:05,813
It'll take them years
to sort this out.

126
00:10:05,897 --> 00:10:09,525
This is his and now
it's yours, and this hers
and now it's his!

127
00:10:12,195 --> 00:10:14,530
And for the rest of you...

128
00:10:15,699 --> 00:10:18,033
Jury duty! Jury duty!
Jury duty!

129
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:20,953
Blackmail. Pink slip.
Chain letter. Eviction notice.

130
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:22,871
Jury duty...

131
00:10:27,377 --> 00:10:31,463
Would you mind helping me
take this to the back room,
honey?

132
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:34,633
But be careful
of the sorting machine, right?

133
00:10:34,718 --> 00:10:35,884
Yeah.

134
00:11:09,419 --> 00:11:10,419
Whew.

135
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:13,464
Gesundheit. Oh.

136
00:11:21,973 --> 00:11:23,974
You're the...

137
00:11:24,059 --> 00:11:26,769
The... The Grinch!

138
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:32,107
Well, that worked out nicely.
Help!

139
00:11:32,776 --> 00:11:33,901
Help!

140
00:11:42,786 --> 00:11:46,121
- Help me! Somebody!
- Max, let's go.

141
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:49,875
Our work here is finished.
Sheesh!

142
00:11:51,086 --> 00:11:53,253
Help me! Please help!

143
00:11:53,338 --> 00:11:55,255
That is not a chew toy!

144
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:58,592
Stop it, Max! Get that
out of your mouth!

145
00:11:58,676 --> 00:12:00,677
You have no idea
where it's been!

146
00:12:05,308 --> 00:12:06,517
Help!

147
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:12,898
Bleeding hearts
of the world, unite!

148
00:12:16,319 --> 00:12:17,569
There!

149
00:12:20,281 --> 00:12:22,908
There! Give me that!

150
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:26,328
Don't you know you're not
supposed to take things
that don't belong to you?

151
00:12:26,413 --> 00:12:28,872
What's the matter with you?
You some kind of wild animal?

152
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:34,253
Let's go.
Thanks for saving me!

153
00:12:41,302 --> 00:12:42,970
Saving you?

154
00:12:43,972 --> 00:12:46,515
Is that what you think
I was doing?

155
00:12:48,977 --> 00:12:50,602
Wrong-o.

156
00:12:53,148 --> 00:12:57,025
I merely noticed that
you were improperly packaged,
my dear.

157
00:12:57,861 --> 00:13:00,446
Drat! Hold still!

158
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:02,990
Max, pick out a bow.

159
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:06,535
Can I use your finger
for a second?

160
00:13:06,703 --> 00:13:08,662
Hello! Hello!

161
00:13:12,876 --> 00:13:14,710
Cindy?
Dad!

162
00:13:16,337 --> 00:13:17,546
Daddy!

163
00:13:18,298 --> 00:13:20,007
Daddy!

164
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:23,302
What the hey... Honey.

165
00:13:24,596 --> 00:13:25,721
Cindy!

166
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:27,973
Dad! It was amazing!

167
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:31,101
You've been practicing
your Christmas wrapping!

168
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:35,564
Honey, I am so proud of you.
Oh, well...

169
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:37,232
Now, that's holiday.

170
00:13:37,317 --> 00:13:40,360
Sweet little Cindy
didn't know what to do.

171
00:13:40,862 --> 00:13:43,989
In her head
bum-tumbled a conflict or two.

172
00:13:44,073 --> 00:13:47,409
"If the Grinch was so bad,
then why did he save me?"

173
00:13:47,577 --> 00:13:49,161
Maybe he wasn't so bad.

174
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:50,329
Come on, let's go home.

175
00:13:50,413 --> 00:13:52,372
Maybe. Just maybe.

176
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:56,126
I've got the Christmas tree
I've got the melody

177
00:13:57,003 --> 00:13:59,838
No lights on in the house.
Your mom must be shoppin'.

178
00:13:59,923 --> 00:14:01,840
Oh, good, I'm so glad
you're home.

179
00:14:01,966 --> 00:14:05,511
Oh, I can feel it, Lou.
This is the year.

180
00:14:06,054 --> 00:14:10,682
When everybody asks who has
the most spectacular lights
in Greater Whoville,

181
00:14:11,643 --> 00:14:15,187
they're gonna cry out,
"Mrs. Betty Lou Who!"

182
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:18,357
Isn't this the chandelier
from the dining room?

183
00:14:18,441 --> 00:14:20,526
It's all for the cause, dear.

184
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:21,985
Oh, and Cindy?
Oh. Yeah.

185
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:23,820
Could you be
Mommy's Little Helper,

186
00:14:23,905 --> 00:14:26,823
and unscrew the bulb there
from the refrigerator?

187
00:14:26,908 --> 00:14:29,743
'Cause somehow
I missed that one.
Go on.

188
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:39,294
Every year Martha May Whovier
has the best lights.

189
00:14:40,338 --> 00:14:42,673
Well, not this year.
This year,

190
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:47,135
I'm gonna beat that prim,
perfect little prissy...

191
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:48,428
Betty!

192
00:14:49,305 --> 00:14:51,974
Hi!
Martha!

193
00:14:52,684 --> 00:14:56,853
My, I've never seen so many
beautiful Christmas lights,
Betty Lou!

194
00:14:56,938 --> 00:15:00,899
Well, I'd blow every fuse
if I tried to keep up
with you, Martha May!

195
00:15:00,984 --> 00:15:05,487
Isn't this antique darling?
It's handcrafted.

196
00:15:05,572 --> 00:15:07,614
And almost 100 years old.

197
00:15:08,324 --> 00:15:10,659
Jeez. I'm really impressed!

198
00:15:10,994 --> 00:15:13,453
This, however, is new.

199
00:15:25,133 --> 00:15:27,467
Whoa up! Hey!
Betty, Betty! Sweetie!

200
00:15:43,526 --> 00:15:45,527
Well, good night, Betty.

201
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:50,532
Oh! I got it!

202
00:15:50,617 --> 00:15:52,534
Honey, honey.
I've got it. I got it. I go...

203
00:15:52,619 --> 00:15:53,785
Hello?

204
00:15:55,038 --> 00:15:57,664
Is my sub-zero
chillibrator running?

205
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:01,251
I suppose.
Well, you better go catch it!

206
00:16:09,844 --> 00:16:11,094
That's a good one!

207
00:16:11,179 --> 00:16:12,679
That is rich.

208
00:16:16,184 --> 00:16:17,392
Let's go home.

209
00:16:21,898 --> 00:16:25,233
Fleas before beauty.
Thank you.

210
00:16:29,072 --> 00:16:31,198
Come on, hurry up.
Slowpoke.

211
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:48,590
Yes! Got to be a better way!

212
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:12,781
A car would have paid
for itself by now!

213
00:17:14,909 --> 00:17:17,452
Oh, goody.
Another load coming down.

214
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:23,792
What's that stench?

215
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:26,211
It's fantastic!

216
00:17:28,548 --> 00:17:30,173
Max! Grab a bag.

217
00:17:31,175 --> 00:17:33,301
We'll come back for the rest.

218
00:17:33,386 --> 00:17:36,221
Of course, when I say "we,"
I mean "you."

219
00:17:36,931 --> 00:17:39,850
It's amazing what these
Whos can throw away.

220
00:17:40,727 --> 00:17:44,396
Oh, well.
One man's toxic sludge

221
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,356
is another man's potpourri.

222
00:17:46,482 --> 00:17:48,817
I don't know.
It's some kind of soap.

223
00:18:01,831 --> 00:18:05,125
Where are you, Christmas

224
00:18:05,835 --> 00:18:08,962
Why can't I find you

225
00:18:09,881 --> 00:18:14,551
Why have you gone away

226
00:18:17,847 --> 00:18:21,349
My world is changing

227
00:18:21,851 --> 00:18:25,520
I'm rearranging

228
00:18:25,813 --> 00:18:28,815
Does that mean Christmas

229
00:18:29,358 --> 00:18:34,321
Changes too

230
00:18:41,704 --> 00:18:45,248
Where are you, Christmas

231
00:18:45,792 --> 00:18:49,044
Do you remember

232
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:54,674
The girl you used to know

233
00:18:56,344 --> 00:18:58,136
You and I

234
00:18:58,221 --> 00:19:01,348
Were so carefree

235
00:19:01,766 --> 00:19:04,935
Now, nothing's easy

236
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:08,855
Did Christmas change

237
00:19:09,065 --> 00:19:12,692
Or just

238
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:17,906
Me

239
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:48,186
Sweet!

240
00:19:57,947 --> 00:20:01,741
Be it ever so heinous

241
00:20:01,868 --> 00:20:05,954
There's no place like home

242
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:12,961
First floor,
factory rejects.

243
00:20:14,547 --> 00:20:16,798
Those Whos are
hard to frazzle, Max!

244
00:20:16,883 --> 00:20:20,176
But, we did our worst.
And that's all that matters.

245
00:20:20,303 --> 00:20:23,930
At least I scared the
bejeebles out of that little
girl at the post office.

246
00:20:24,015 --> 00:20:26,266
She'll be scarred for life,
if we're lucky.

247
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:45,327
Funny she didn't
rat on us, though.

248
00:20:45,411 --> 00:20:47,579
Must be afraid of reprisals.

249
00:20:59,592 --> 00:21:03,595
Yes! Down a size and a half!

250
00:21:04,972 --> 00:21:07,557
And this time,
I'll keep it off.

251
00:21:09,936 --> 00:21:12,395
Get the stick, Max.
Get the stick!

252
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,068
There's no stick!

253
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:19,736
I'm smarter.

254
00:21:26,786 --> 00:21:28,161
Any calls?

255
00:21:30,039 --> 00:21:31,998
You have no messages.

256
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:35,377
Odd.
Better check the outgoing.

257
00:21:37,213 --> 00:21:39,756
If you
utter so much as one syllable

258
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:43,426
I'll hunt you down
and gut you like a fish!

259
00:21:44,053 --> 00:21:46,304
If you'd like to fax me,
press the star key.

260
00:21:48,933 --> 00:21:50,225
Oh, well.

261
00:21:55,773 --> 00:21:57,524
That's more like it.

262
00:22:18,129 --> 00:22:19,713
Excellent year.

263
00:22:20,589 --> 00:22:22,173
I'll tell you, Max,

264
00:22:22,258 --> 00:22:25,093
I don't know
why I ever leave this place.

265
00:22:25,219 --> 00:22:28,847
I've got all the company
I need right here.

266
00:22:30,224 --> 00:22:33,268
Hello!
Hello!

267
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:37,147
How are you?
How are you?

268
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:40,608
I asked you first!
I asked you first!

269
00:22:40,776 --> 00:22:45,280
Oh, that's really mature,
saying exactly what I say!

270
00:22:45,406 --> 00:22:48,825
...mature... Mature...
Exactly what I say

271
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:53,288
I'm an idiot!
You're an idiot!

272
00:22:56,917 --> 00:22:59,711
All right, fine.
I'm not talking
to you anymore.

273
00:22:59,795 --> 00:23:01,671
In fact, I'm going to whisper,

274
00:23:01,756 --> 00:23:04,758
so that by the time my voice
reverberates off the walls

275
00:23:04,842 --> 00:23:06,384
and gets back to me,

276
00:23:06,469 --> 00:23:09,054
I won't be able to hear it!

277
00:23:10,473 --> 00:23:12,098
You're an idiot!

278
00:23:24,403 --> 00:23:26,946
Am I just eating
because I'm bored?

279
00:23:36,832 --> 00:23:38,750
Who could that be?

280
00:23:40,586 --> 00:23:43,630
Hello, little girl.
Are you here to read to us?

281
00:23:43,714 --> 00:23:48,218
No. I hear
you know some things
about the Grinch.

282
00:23:48,302 --> 00:23:51,846
Cindy Lou
had some questions
in her curious heart.

283
00:23:52,306 --> 00:23:55,975
Why did the Grinch
hate Christmas?
Where did it all start?

284
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:59,312
With her dad's blabbacorder,
she wouldn't give an inch.

285
00:23:59,396 --> 00:24:04,025
In your own words,
please tell me everything
you know about the Grinch.

286
00:24:04,527 --> 00:24:07,570
Where did he come from?
Oh, well.

287
00:24:07,988 --> 00:24:10,198
He came the way
all Who babies come.

288
00:24:12,034 --> 00:24:15,286
On calm nights,
baby Who girls

289
00:24:15,371 --> 00:24:17,622
and tiny Who fellas

290
00:24:18,457 --> 00:24:22,627
drift from the sky
in their own pumbersellas.

291
00:24:30,678 --> 00:24:31,803
Hey, honey!

292
00:24:31,887 --> 00:24:33,471
Our baby's here!

293
00:24:36,058 --> 00:24:38,309
He looks just like your boss.

294
00:24:39,186 --> 00:24:42,063
Oh! So that's how it works.

295
00:24:43,399 --> 00:24:47,902
It was Christmas Eve,
and a strange wind
blew that night.

296
00:25:14,722 --> 00:25:17,765
We were having
our annual holiday
get-together.

297
00:25:40,122 --> 00:25:44,584
It was morning before
anybody realized
that he was out there!

298
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:47,670
The poor dear!
But, you know what?

299
00:25:48,172 --> 00:25:50,131
We knew right away
that he was special.

300
00:25:50,758 --> 00:25:53,927
Christmas time is here again

301
00:25:54,094 --> 00:25:58,181
Oh. Do you want
a Christmas cookie?

302
00:25:58,265 --> 00:26:01,309
Yes, which Christmas cookie
would you like?

303
00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:02,477
Santa.

304
00:26:02,561 --> 00:26:05,230
Oh! His first words!

305
00:26:05,314 --> 00:26:08,149
Yes, that is a Santa plate.

306
00:26:08,234 --> 00:26:10,818
Do you want to
hold this Santa plate?

307
00:26:18,035 --> 00:26:19,994
Santa, bye-bye!

308
00:26:23,123 --> 00:26:26,209
Oh, he was a wonderful...

309
00:26:26,877 --> 00:26:28,503
Whatever he was.

310
00:26:29,171 --> 00:26:32,382
And we raised him
like any other Who child

311
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:35,134
with a deep love of Christmas.

312
00:26:38,347 --> 00:26:41,849
Don't forget,
tomorrow's our big Christmas
gift exchange.

313
00:26:42,017 --> 00:26:45,395
Everyone bring a special gift
for a special someone.

314
00:26:46,855 --> 00:26:49,190
The... Grinch...

315
00:26:50,734 --> 00:26:53,403
He had no sense
of color coordination.

316
00:26:54,363 --> 00:26:58,199
Although I hardly
remember him. I didn't
have time to socialize.

317
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:02,078
I was far too busy
with my studies.

318
00:27:02,788 --> 00:27:05,707
Now, class,
is everyone almost finished?

319
00:27:07,876 --> 00:27:11,337
And if the truth be told,
he liked Martha.

320
00:27:13,132 --> 00:27:15,174
Martha was my girlfriend.

321
00:27:17,928 --> 00:27:19,971
I don't like
discussing this Grinch

322
00:27:20,055 --> 00:27:22,140
so very close
to Christmas, but

323
00:27:22,224 --> 00:27:25,143
maybe if you hear the truth,
you'll understand why...

324
00:27:25,227 --> 00:27:27,145
Put your back into it!

325
00:27:27,730 --> 00:27:31,024
I tried to take him
under my wing.

326
00:27:31,358 --> 00:27:32,525
You don't have a chance
with her.

327
00:27:32,609 --> 00:27:35,570
You're eight years old
and you have a beard!

328
00:27:38,907 --> 00:27:41,367
He had hair. Not pleasant.

329
00:27:43,454 --> 00:27:45,913
He shed. Not right.

330
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:52,253
You know, Christmas is
my favorite time of year.

331
00:27:52,463 --> 00:27:54,422
I just love the colors.

332
00:27:54,798 --> 00:27:58,134
Red. And green.

333
00:28:01,805 --> 00:28:04,265
Did I have a crush
on the Grinch?

334
00:28:05,225 --> 00:28:07,018
Well, of course not.

335
00:28:07,102 --> 00:28:11,230
I didn't ask you that.
Oh. Right.

336
00:28:13,233 --> 00:28:15,526
For some reason,
when he came home that day,

337
00:28:15,611 --> 00:28:18,863
he really got
into the Christmas spirit
for the first time.

338
00:28:18,947 --> 00:28:20,031
Baby, picture you and me

339
00:28:20,115 --> 00:28:21,199
Perfect!

340
00:28:22,284 --> 00:28:24,410
Hangin' 'round
a Christmas tree

341
00:28:24,495 --> 00:28:25,620
Whoopsy.

342
00:28:25,704 --> 00:28:28,289
Colored lights
and an angel up above

343
00:28:29,583 --> 00:28:31,417
Christmas of love

344
00:28:32,294 --> 00:28:34,629
What a lovely family heirloom!

345
00:28:34,797 --> 00:28:35,838
Gather everyone

346
00:28:35,964 --> 00:28:37,048
And they're gonna come

347
00:28:37,132 --> 00:28:40,385
Have a lot of fun
at Christmas time

348
00:28:40,469 --> 00:28:43,679
Now it's on the way
Everybody say

349
00:28:44,181 --> 00:28:46,224
We're gonna have
a Christmas of love

350
00:28:46,642 --> 00:28:48,476
The fires of love!

351
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,895
Baby, make a little wish

352
00:28:51,188 --> 00:28:53,606
This will be
perfect on the top
of her tree.

353
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:56,567
Oh, Martha! Oh, Christmas!

354
00:28:56,652 --> 00:28:59,112
Everything you been
dreaming of

355
00:28:59,196 --> 00:29:02,907
Christmas of love
Love, love, love

356
00:29:02,991 --> 00:29:06,160
I want you all to
look your best tomorrow.

357
00:29:07,287 --> 00:29:09,163
You don't have a chance
with her.

358
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:12,208
You're eight years old
and you have a beard!

359
00:29:27,808 --> 00:29:29,392
Has everyone
given their gifts?

360
00:29:30,561 --> 00:29:32,687
- I haven't.
- What?

361
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:41,654
Merry Christmas, Martha May.

362
00:29:43,031 --> 00:29:45,575
Why do you have a bag
on your head?

363
00:29:46,326 --> 00:29:50,037
Probably because
he's embarrassed
by that hideoderous gift.

364
00:29:51,582 --> 00:29:53,416
Mr. Grinch,

365
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:55,835
please take the bag off.

366
00:29:57,254 --> 00:29:59,797
Yes, you take it off.

367
00:30:04,595 --> 00:30:06,679
Put the book down.

368
00:30:11,059 --> 00:30:12,894
And your foot.

369
00:30:15,564 --> 00:30:17,482
Look at that hack job!

370
00:30:28,744 --> 00:30:30,786
Stupid present!

371
00:30:31,497 --> 00:30:32,914
Stupid tree!

372
00:30:33,207 --> 00:30:36,417
I hate Christmas!

373
00:30:36,502 --> 00:30:39,045
The anger.
The fury!

374
00:30:39,213 --> 00:30:41,005
The muscles!

375
00:30:52,476 --> 00:30:54,227
It was a horrible day,

376
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:57,563
when they were so cruel
to him.

377
00:30:57,648 --> 00:30:58,856
And...

378
00:31:00,442 --> 00:31:02,360
I could hardly bear it.

379
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:21,128
I hate Christmas! I hate it!

380
00:31:22,422 --> 00:31:25,216
And that was
the last time we ever saw him.

381
00:31:27,594 --> 00:31:29,971
The very last time.

382
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:24,942
So, whatever the reason,
his heart or his shoes,

383
00:32:25,569 --> 00:32:29,947
he stood outside his cave,
hating the Whos.

384
00:32:30,741 --> 00:32:32,325
Alphabetically.

385
00:32:34,661 --> 00:32:36,954
Aadvarkian Abakenezer Who,

386
00:32:37,247 --> 00:32:40,374
I hate you!

387
00:32:45,631 --> 00:32:48,716
Aaron B. Benson Who,
I hate you.

388
00:32:49,509 --> 00:32:51,510
Hate, hate, hate.
Hate, hate, hate.

389
00:32:51,595 --> 00:32:53,054
Double hate.

390
00:32:53,639 --> 00:32:57,058
Loathe entirely!

391
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:05,399
Nutcrackers?

392
00:33:06,568 --> 00:33:09,403
It's their Whobilation.

393
00:33:09,488 --> 00:33:12,198
He snarled
with a sneer.

394
00:33:12,949 --> 00:33:16,911
Tomorrow is Christmas!
It's practically here.

395
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,330
Max!

396
00:33:19,623 --> 00:33:22,291
Fetch me my sedative.

397
00:33:24,044 --> 00:33:26,879
Now to take care
of those pesky memories.

398
00:33:29,132 --> 00:33:32,218
Whobilation,
plentiful
With candy canes and pies

399
00:33:32,302 --> 00:33:35,221
I can't wait to get there
To eat some google fries

400
00:33:35,305 --> 00:33:37,390
Whobilation, Whobilation

401
00:33:37,474 --> 00:33:38,516
Dad?
Yeah.

402
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:40,851
I've been thinking
about the Whobilation.

403
00:33:40,936 --> 00:33:42,687
And I may do
something drastic.

404
00:33:42,771 --> 00:33:44,814
That's fine, dear.
Ask your mother.

405
00:33:45,023 --> 00:33:47,441
- Where'd she go?
- Honey!

406
00:33:47,526 --> 00:33:49,276
Honey. Hi!

407
00:33:50,404 --> 00:33:53,656
Look, I just found
the cutest light
for my Christmas display.

408
00:33:55,617 --> 00:33:57,827
Hurry up, we're gonna be late.
Come on.

409
00:34:16,805 --> 00:34:18,889
And now, the nominations...

410
00:34:18,974 --> 00:34:21,809
for that Who among us
who best typifies

411
00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:25,312
the qualities of Who-dom
and Who-dery

412
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:29,817
the Whoville
Holiday Cheermeister!

413
00:34:38,243 --> 00:34:40,995
Do I hear a nomination?

414
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:42,621
I nominate the Grinch!

415
00:34:44,833 --> 00:34:46,417
- The Grinch?
- The Grinch?

416
00:34:46,501 --> 00:34:47,710
The Grinch?

417
00:34:49,588 --> 00:34:51,464
My, my, my.

418
00:34:51,548 --> 00:34:55,092
What an altruistic daughter
you have there, Lou!

419
00:34:56,052 --> 00:34:57,386
Thank you.

420
00:34:59,181 --> 00:35:00,389
Cindy?

421
00:35:03,185 --> 00:35:05,811
Let me quote a verse

422
00:35:06,271 --> 00:35:08,230
from The Book of Who.

423
00:35:08,815 --> 00:35:10,357
Thank you.

424
00:35:10,442 --> 00:35:12,359
"The term 'Grinchy'
shall apply

425
00:35:12,444 --> 00:35:15,613
"when Christmas spirit
is in short supply."

426
00:35:15,697 --> 00:35:19,116
Now, I ask you,
does that sound like
our Holiday Cheermeister?

427
00:35:19,201 --> 00:35:23,621
True, Mr. May Who.
But The Book of Who
says this too,

428
00:35:23,789 --> 00:35:26,290
"No matter how different
a Who may appear,

429
00:35:26,374 --> 00:35:29,502
"he will always be welcomed
with holiday cheer."

430
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:35,341
Whoa. Yes, well,
the Book also says, the...

431
00:35:35,717 --> 00:35:39,970
"The award cannot go
to the Grinch, because

432
00:35:40,055 --> 00:35:43,933
"sometimes things get
the lead pipe cinch."

433
00:35:44,017 --> 00:35:46,560
You made that up!
It doesn't say that.

434
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:48,979
No, no, no, no, it does.

435
00:35:50,106 --> 00:35:51,524
What page?

436
00:35:54,361 --> 00:35:55,569
Lost my...

437
00:35:55,654 --> 00:35:57,780
My place, but it's...

438
00:35:58,031 --> 00:36:00,866
It's in here!
But the Book does say

439
00:36:01,076 --> 00:36:05,079
"The Cheermeister is the one
who deserves a back slap
or a toast.

440
00:36:05,330 --> 00:36:08,541
"And it goes to the soul
at Christmas
who needs it most."

441
00:36:08,625 --> 00:36:11,293
And I believe that soul
is the Grinch.

442
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:15,089
And if you're the Whos
I hope you are,

443
00:36:15,298 --> 00:36:16,799
you will too.

444
00:36:17,676 --> 00:36:19,093
She's right!

445
00:36:23,765 --> 00:36:25,474
Fine. Fine.

446
00:36:26,268 --> 00:36:29,687
You people want to waste
a perfectly good nomination,

447
00:36:29,771 --> 00:36:31,313
why, it's up to you.

448
00:36:31,398 --> 00:36:33,941
But I am telling you,

449
00:36:34,401 --> 00:36:37,611
the Grinch
will never come down.

450
00:36:37,821 --> 00:36:40,656
And when he doesn't,
the Mayor will wear the crown.

451
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:43,284
Well, more or less.

452
00:36:44,119 --> 00:36:46,620
Deck your heart with jollity

453
00:36:46,705 --> 00:36:49,123
Style your smile
all Christmas-y

454
00:36:49,499 --> 00:36:52,251
Flick some flocking
on the tree

455
00:36:52,335 --> 00:36:55,087
Let there be Whobilation

456
00:36:55,171 --> 00:36:57,923
Bake the fruitcake
Egg the nog

457
00:36:58,008 --> 00:37:00,718
Feed the flaming Who-ltide log

458
00:37:00,802 --> 00:37:03,637
Baste the beast
and gulp the grog

459
00:37:03,805 --> 00:37:06,557
Let there be Whobilation

460
00:37:06,641 --> 00:37:09,101
Tick, tock, tick tock
Tick, tock, tick, tock

461
00:37:09,185 --> 00:37:12,104
Counting down
the Christmas clock

462
00:37:12,188 --> 00:37:14,773
Old, young, big, small

463
00:37:22,324 --> 00:37:24,742
Blast this Christmas music.

464
00:37:25,994 --> 00:37:28,162
It's joyful and triumphant.

465
00:37:29,331 --> 00:37:31,665
Must drown them out!

466
00:37:40,759 --> 00:37:42,384
Not working!

467
00:37:44,512 --> 00:37:47,932
The whipperwinds
whipped high above
the Who town,

468
00:37:48,016 --> 00:37:51,727
a trip or a slip,
you'd slide all the way down.

469
00:37:52,437 --> 00:37:55,564
But this girl had a mission.
She knew what to do.

470
00:37:55,649 --> 00:37:57,566
She'd invite
the Grinch herself,

471
00:37:57,859 --> 00:38:00,027
that brave Cindy Lou.

472
00:38:08,370 --> 00:38:11,538
Play, monkey! Play!

473
00:38:24,135 --> 00:38:25,886
Ow-y!

474
00:38:29,015 --> 00:38:30,391
Mr. Grinch?

475
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:35,229
Mr. Grinch!

476
00:38:40,276 --> 00:38:41,485
Hello?

477
00:39:07,804 --> 00:39:09,179
Excuse me.

478
00:39:24,946 --> 00:39:28,532
Hello, little girl.

479
00:39:29,075 --> 00:39:31,827
How dare you enter

480
00:39:31,911 --> 00:39:34,413
the Grinch's lair?

481
00:39:34,581 --> 00:39:37,541
The impudence! The audacity!

482
00:39:37,876 --> 00:39:40,335
The unmitigated gall!

483
00:39:40,462 --> 00:39:44,631
You called down the thunder,
now, get ready

484
00:39:44,716 --> 00:39:46,717
for the boom!

485
00:39:46,968 --> 00:39:50,804
Gaze into the face of fear!

486
00:39:53,308 --> 00:39:54,683
Mr. Grinch,

487
00:39:55,643 --> 00:39:57,603
my name is Cindy Lou Who.

488
00:39:57,687 --> 00:40:01,273
You see, even now the terror

489
00:40:01,357 --> 00:40:03,817
is welling up inside you.

490
00:40:04,444 --> 00:40:06,070
I'm not scared.

491
00:40:06,154 --> 00:40:10,407
Denial is to be expected
in the face of pure evil.

492
00:40:12,577 --> 00:40:14,244
I don't think so.

493
00:40:15,288 --> 00:40:16,330
Doubt?

494
00:40:16,414 --> 00:40:20,334
Another unmistakable sign
of the heebie-jeebies!

495
00:40:21,002 --> 00:40:24,505
Now, you're doomed!

496
00:40:32,013 --> 00:40:34,181
Run for your life,

497
00:40:34,265 --> 00:40:37,559
before I kill again!

498
00:40:39,896 --> 00:40:41,355
I'm a psycho!

499
00:40:44,526 --> 00:40:47,069
Danger! Danger!

500
00:40:56,371 --> 00:40:58,372
Maybe you need a timeout.

501
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:08,382
Kids today.
So desensitized by movies
and television.

502
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:12,970
What do you want?
Mr. Grinch,

503
00:41:13,388 --> 00:41:17,891
I came to invite you
to be Holiday Cheermeister.

504
00:41:20,395 --> 00:41:22,062
"Holiday Whoobie-what-y?"

505
00:41:22,147 --> 00:41:24,189
Cheermeister.

506
00:41:24,399 --> 00:41:26,400
"Cheermeister...
Celebrate with friends."

507
00:41:31,156 --> 00:41:32,739
That's a good one.

508
00:41:33,449 --> 00:41:35,284
I know you hate Christmas,

509
00:41:35,410 --> 00:41:38,120
but what if it's all
just a misunderstanding?
Don't care.

510
00:41:38,204 --> 00:41:41,415
I mean, I myself am having
some Yuletide doubts.

511
00:41:41,916 --> 00:41:44,459
But maybe if you can
reunite with the Whos

512
00:41:44,544 --> 00:41:46,753
and be a part of Christmas...

513
00:41:48,756 --> 00:41:51,925
Grow up!
Then maybe it'll be
all right for me, too!

514
00:41:52,010 --> 00:41:53,594
I'm sorry,
your session is over.

515
00:41:53,678 --> 00:41:56,680
Please make another
appointment with the
receptionist on the way out.

516
00:41:56,764 --> 00:41:59,766
Please, please.
You have to accept the award.

517
00:42:04,647 --> 00:42:05,856
Award?

518
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:11,945
You never mentioned an award.

519
00:42:12,488 --> 00:42:14,573
Yeah, with a trophy
and everything!

520
00:42:14,741 --> 00:42:16,533
And I won?
You won!

521
00:42:17,785 --> 00:42:20,329
That means there were losers.
I guess.

522
00:42:20,413 --> 00:42:24,791
So, if you come...
A town full of losers!

523
00:42:25,376 --> 00:42:26,752
I like it.

524
00:42:27,587 --> 00:42:30,297
Was anyone
emotionally shattered?

525
00:42:31,132 --> 00:42:32,841
Come on, a minute ago
I couldn't shut you up!

526
00:42:32,926 --> 00:42:34,426
Details, details!

527
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:36,887
Well, the Mayor wasn't happy.

528
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:40,140
Oh! No.

529
00:42:41,059 --> 00:42:43,101
Martha May will be there.

530
00:42:44,604 --> 00:42:46,104
Oh, she will?

531
00:42:47,232 --> 00:42:50,359
And she'll see me. A winner.

532
00:42:51,736 --> 00:42:53,820
She'll be on me
like fleegle flies

533
00:42:53,905 --> 00:42:55,739
on a flat-faced floogle horse.

534
00:42:55,907 --> 00:42:58,492
Well, I'm sorry
to disappoint you,
Martha baby.

535
00:42:58,660 --> 00:43:00,911
But the "G" train
has left the station.

536
00:43:00,995 --> 00:43:02,704
So, will you come?

537
00:43:03,539 --> 00:43:05,082
Oh, all right.

538
00:43:05,875 --> 00:43:08,460
I don't know if it's that
adorable twinkle in your eye,

539
00:43:08,544 --> 00:43:10,462
or that nonconformist streak

540
00:43:10,546 --> 00:43:14,007
the reminds me of a younger,
less hairy me.

541
00:43:14,342 --> 00:43:16,301
But you've convinced me.

542
00:43:16,386 --> 00:43:17,427
Who knows?

543
00:43:17,512 --> 00:43:21,765
This Whobilation could change
my entire outlook on life!

544
00:43:22,016 --> 00:43:23,725
Really?
No.

545
00:43:57,719 --> 00:44:01,722
There you are. Honey.
You can make
snow angels later.

546
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:04,599
We can't be late
for the Whobilation!

547
00:44:08,313 --> 00:44:11,315
The nerve of those Whos.
Inviting me down there.

548
00:44:11,399 --> 00:44:13,191
On such short notice.

549
00:44:13,276 --> 00:44:16,862
Even if I wanted to go,
my schedule wouldn't allow it!

550
00:44:19,365 --> 00:44:21,700
"4:00, wallow in self-pity.

551
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:25,037
"4:30, stare into the abyss.

552
00:44:25,955 --> 00:44:27,998
"5:00, solve world hunger,

553
00:44:28,082 --> 00:44:29,666
"tell no one.

554
00:44:30,251 --> 00:44:31,960
"5:30, Jazzercise.

555
00:44:32,253 --> 00:44:35,505
"6:30, dinner with me."
I can't cancel that again.

556
00:44:35,757 --> 00:44:38,925
"7:00, wrestle with
my self-loathing"

557
00:44:39,302 --> 00:44:40,635
I'm booked!

558
00:44:40,762 --> 00:44:42,387
Of course, if I bumped
the loathing to 9:00,

559
00:44:42,472 --> 00:44:45,098
I could still be done in time
to lay in bed,
stare at the ceiling,

560
00:44:45,183 --> 00:44:47,434
and slip slowly into madness.

561
00:44:48,603 --> 00:44:50,479
But what would I wear?

562
00:45:10,458 --> 00:45:12,751
It's not a dress, it's a kilt!

563
00:45:14,337 --> 00:45:15,670
Sicko!

564
00:45:17,632 --> 00:45:21,385
Stupid. Ugly. Out of date!

565
00:45:23,096 --> 00:45:24,554
This is ridiculous.

566
00:45:24,639 --> 00:45:28,141
If I can't find something
nice to wear, I'm not going.

567
00:45:46,452 --> 00:45:47,786
That's it, I'm not going.

568
00:46:00,508 --> 00:46:05,137
Well, it's time for our
Holiday Cheermeister
of the Year Award!

569
00:46:11,436 --> 00:46:14,646
Congratulations, Mr. Grinch!

570
00:46:17,358 --> 00:46:18,900
He isn't here.

571
00:46:19,402 --> 00:46:20,527
What?

572
00:46:21,404 --> 00:46:24,531
He didn't show? Oh.

573
00:46:24,866 --> 00:46:27,159
Who could have predicted this?

574
00:46:27,994 --> 00:46:30,704
All right.
I'll swing by for a minute,

575
00:46:30,830 --> 00:46:34,833
allow them to envy me,
grab a handful of popcorn
shrimp, and blow out of there.

576
00:46:35,710 --> 00:46:39,629
But what if
it's a cruel prank?
What if it's a cash bar?

577
00:46:40,047 --> 00:46:43,592
How dare they?
All right, I'll go.

578
00:46:43,968 --> 00:46:47,679
But I'll be fashionably late.
No. Yes. No. Yes. No!

579
00:46:48,014 --> 00:46:49,097
Yes!

580
00:46:50,892 --> 00:46:52,434
Definitely not!

581
00:46:52,768 --> 00:46:55,228
All right.
I've made my decision.

582
00:46:55,730 --> 00:46:57,898
I'm going, and that's that.

583
00:46:59,525 --> 00:47:01,443
Had my fingers crossed.

584
00:47:05,031 --> 00:47:07,491
Maybe I should flip a coin!

585
00:47:15,249 --> 00:47:19,586
Well, I guess the award goes
to the runner-up.

586
00:47:21,714 --> 00:47:23,006
That's right.

587
00:47:23,090 --> 00:47:26,259
A man for whom
Christmas comes,
not once a year,

588
00:47:26,469 --> 00:47:28,637
but every minute of every day!

589
00:47:28,888 --> 00:47:31,306
A handsome, noble man,

590
00:47:31,933 --> 00:47:34,809
a man who's had his tonsils
removed twice!

591
00:47:35,645 --> 00:47:37,562
That's an interesting story.

592
00:47:37,730 --> 00:47:39,940
You see, what happened was...

593
00:47:54,455 --> 00:47:55,956
Hello, Martha.

594
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:57,290
He made it!

595
00:47:57,333 --> 00:47:59,334
Cindy, wha...
Honey!

596
00:48:26,153 --> 00:48:27,988
Hot crowd. Hot crowd.

597
00:48:29,657 --> 00:48:31,658
I believe I'm here to

598
00:48:33,786 --> 00:48:36,830
accept an award of some kind?

599
00:48:37,957 --> 00:48:40,667
And the child

600
00:48:41,711 --> 00:48:43,378
mentioned a check?

601
00:48:43,462 --> 00:48:45,922
No, I didn't.
All right, then,
give me the award.

602
00:48:46,007 --> 00:48:47,924
Come on, while I'm young!

603
00:48:48,175 --> 00:48:50,927
Don't you worry,
Mr. Holiday Cheermeister,

604
00:48:51,012 --> 00:48:52,596
you'll get your award.

605
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:56,808
But first,
a little family reunion.

606
00:48:57,810 --> 00:48:59,352
They nursed you.

607
00:48:59,437 --> 00:49:02,480
They clothed you.
Here they are,

608
00:49:02,565 --> 00:49:05,483
your Old Biddies!

609
00:49:07,111 --> 00:49:09,863
Are you two still living?

610
00:49:10,281 --> 00:49:12,616
Oh.
We missed you!

611
00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:15,285
Rose. The sweater.
The sweater, Rose.

612
00:49:15,369 --> 00:49:17,829
Sweater? What are you
talkin' about? No, I can't!

613
00:49:18,164 --> 00:49:19,789
I can't do this!

614
00:49:22,126 --> 00:49:23,960
Don't touch me there!

615
00:49:31,886 --> 00:49:33,928
Put him in the Chair of Cheer!

616
00:49:34,013 --> 00:49:36,848
Chair of Cheer?
What's the Chair of Cheer?

617
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:42,646
You didn't tell me about
the Chair of Cheer!
Please, Mr. Grinch. Please?

618
00:49:43,731 --> 00:49:47,025
No, no, no. I can't do it.
Honestly. I'm not ready.
It's too much, too soon!

619
00:49:47,109 --> 00:49:48,735
It's that time of year.

620
00:49:48,819 --> 00:49:52,405
The Cheermeister's ride
in the Chair of Cheer!

621
00:49:52,531 --> 00:49:55,742
Put me down!
I mean it! I've got a lawyer.

622
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:58,161
There'll be hell to pay!

623
00:49:59,580 --> 00:50:02,540
First, you'll put your
taste buds to the test

624
00:50:02,667 --> 00:50:07,462
as you judge the
Who-Pudding Cook-off!
Who-Pudding Cook-off!

625
00:50:07,755 --> 00:50:09,673
Mine first.
I really don't know.

626
00:50:09,757 --> 00:50:11,591
No, mine's the best!

627
00:50:12,051 --> 00:50:13,760
You'll enjoy this!

628
00:50:14,595 --> 00:50:16,721
This is not pudding.

629
00:50:17,556 --> 00:50:18,932
What is it?

630
00:50:19,934 --> 00:50:22,394
This is mine.
Yummy, yummy, yummy.

631
00:50:23,229 --> 00:50:25,271
Christmas Conga!

632
00:50:25,356 --> 00:50:27,774
Gee, look at the time.
I really should be
getting back.

633
00:50:28,442 --> 00:50:29,776
All right!

634
00:50:35,241 --> 00:50:37,242
Fruitcake... Fa la-la!

635
00:50:37,910 --> 00:50:38,952
No.

636
00:50:44,500 --> 00:50:46,292
Fudge Judge.

637
00:50:49,046 --> 00:50:51,047
Made it myself.
Yeah?

638
00:50:51,132 --> 00:50:53,842
Mine are homemade too.
Okay.

639
00:50:54,885 --> 00:50:56,970
Put it in. Bring it on!

640
00:50:57,471 --> 00:50:59,222
Is that all you got?

641
00:50:59,306 --> 00:51:01,641
Is that all you got? Come on.

642
00:51:07,148 --> 00:51:09,023
Outta the way, slow-mo!

643
00:51:24,582 --> 00:51:27,125
He's number one
in the sack race run!

644
00:51:27,209 --> 00:51:30,044
Number one! I'm number one!

645
00:51:30,421 --> 00:51:32,505
I'm number one!

646
00:51:33,090 --> 00:51:36,134
No child can beat the Grinch!

647
00:51:36,302 --> 00:51:37,761
Yeah!

648
00:51:41,348 --> 00:51:43,349
I beat you.

649
00:51:54,528 --> 00:51:57,947
And now it's time
for the moment
we've all been waiting for.

650
00:51:58,032 --> 00:52:00,408
Yes! My award.

651
00:52:00,993 --> 00:52:02,619
Write the check.
There's no check.

652
00:52:02,703 --> 00:52:04,162
Are you sure?

653
00:52:04,246 --> 00:52:06,623
Because I really thought
I heard someone
mention a check.

654
00:52:06,707 --> 00:52:07,665
I said, there's no check.

655
00:52:07,750 --> 00:52:11,085
And now it's time
for Present Pass It On!

656
00:52:12,129 --> 00:52:14,964
As always, we start
with our Cheermeister.

657
00:52:23,724 --> 00:52:25,892
A gift of a Christmas shave.

658
00:52:40,574 --> 00:52:42,826
Look at that hack job!

659
00:52:53,254 --> 00:52:55,463
Yes, yes, yes. Good times!

660
00:52:56,882 --> 00:52:58,258
Good times.

661
00:52:58,884 --> 00:53:00,969
And now, I have
a little something

662
00:53:01,053 --> 00:53:03,096
for the love of my life.

663
00:53:04,223 --> 00:53:05,807
Martha May,

664
00:53:08,394 --> 00:53:11,604
please become
Mrs. Augustus May Who.

665
00:53:19,446 --> 00:53:20,947
Augustus.

666
00:53:21,949 --> 00:53:26,494
If you agree to be my wife,
along with a lifetime supply
of happiness,

667
00:53:26,579 --> 00:53:28,621
you'll also receive this...

668
00:53:31,083 --> 00:53:33,710
It's a new car!

669
00:53:34,420 --> 00:53:38,006
Generously provided
by the taxpayers of Whoville!

670
00:53:40,050 --> 00:53:41,759
What do you say, Martha?

671
00:53:42,177 --> 00:53:45,138
Ya got 20 seconds
on the clock.

672
00:53:47,099 --> 00:53:49,726
Well, I...

673
00:53:53,063 --> 00:53:55,815
These gifts
are quite dazzling.

674
00:54:05,993 --> 00:54:08,369
Of course they are.

675
00:54:09,330 --> 00:54:11,414
That's what it's all about,
isn't it?

676
00:54:11,498 --> 00:54:15,043
That's what
it's always been about!

677
00:54:16,295 --> 00:54:18,838
Gifts! Gifts.

678
00:54:19,048 --> 00:54:21,341
Gifts, gifts, gifts,
gifts, gifts.

679
00:54:22,343 --> 00:54:24,636
You wanna know
what happens to your gifts?

680
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:27,764
They all come to me.
In your garbage.

681
00:54:28,015 --> 00:54:31,517
You see what I'm saying?
In your garbage!

682
00:54:32,561 --> 00:54:37,315
I could hang myself with
all the bad Christmas neckties
I found at the dump!

683
00:54:38,859 --> 00:54:40,526
And the avarice.

684
00:54:41,862 --> 00:54:45,031
The avarice never ends!

685
00:54:45,115 --> 00:54:47,617
"I want golf clubs."
"I want diamonds."
"I want a pony

686
00:54:47,701 --> 00:54:51,120
"so I can ride it twice,
get bored,
and sell it to make glue!"

687
00:54:51,580 --> 00:54:53,122
Look, I don't wanna
make waves.

688
00:54:53,207 --> 00:54:56,709
But this whole
Christmas season

689
00:54:56,794 --> 00:54:58,962
is stupid, stupid, stupid!

690
00:55:00,714 --> 00:55:02,632
There is, however,

691
00:55:03,342 --> 00:55:06,386
one teeny-tiny

692
00:55:06,679 --> 00:55:08,471
Christmas tradition

693
00:55:08,847 --> 00:55:10,306
I find

694
00:55:10,975 --> 00:55:13,851
quite meaningful.

695
00:55:18,941 --> 00:55:20,650
Mistletoe.

696
00:55:20,859 --> 00:55:23,903
Now, pucker up
and kiss it, Whoville!

697
00:55:32,413 --> 00:55:35,415
Somebody's fabulous!

698
00:55:38,460 --> 00:55:41,295
All right, your turn!
Go on! That way!

699
00:55:48,554 --> 00:55:50,054
Let's go!
No!

700
00:55:50,305 --> 00:55:52,098
Excuse me, old-timer.

701
00:55:52,683 --> 00:55:54,392
Mind if I wet my whistle?

702
00:55:54,476 --> 00:55:55,893
Well...

703
00:55:59,398 --> 00:56:01,190
That's my good stuff!

704
00:56:08,907 --> 00:56:11,951
Burn, baby! Burn!

705
00:56:22,504 --> 00:56:23,796
Oh, wow.

706
00:56:24,089 --> 00:56:27,133
Oh, the Whomanity!

707
00:56:28,052 --> 00:56:29,635
Let's go! Come on!
No! Wait!

708
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:31,929
Do something.
Right!

709
00:56:39,646 --> 00:56:42,231
Calling all units.
Calling all units.

710
00:56:45,819 --> 00:56:46,903
Taxi!

711
00:56:49,156 --> 00:56:51,783
It's because I'm green,
isn't it?

712
00:56:56,580 --> 00:56:57,914
Halt!

713
00:56:59,541 --> 00:57:02,210
Evening, folks.
Mind if I ride along?

714
00:57:02,586 --> 00:57:04,712
You might wanna scooch over.

715
00:57:07,174 --> 00:57:08,966
You did the right thing.

716
00:57:17,017 --> 00:57:18,559
Outta the way!

717
00:57:20,187 --> 00:57:21,437
Hey!

718
00:57:28,237 --> 00:57:30,613
That's gonna hurt
in the morning.

719
00:57:54,930 --> 00:57:57,056
It's gonna blow!

720
00:58:14,658 --> 00:58:18,327
You fellas all right?
Hey, how about a nice hat?

721
00:58:18,412 --> 00:58:19,579
Lou?

722
00:58:28,547 --> 00:58:30,047
I'm hurt, Lou.

723
00:58:31,341 --> 00:58:33,843
I'm hurt,
and I don't hurt easily.

724
00:58:33,927 --> 00:58:36,929
But you and your family...

725
00:58:37,598 --> 00:58:39,182
I'm so...

726
00:58:39,266 --> 00:58:40,850
So disappointed.

727
00:58:42,728 --> 00:58:47,273
Can we just get back
to Christmas
the way it should be?

728
00:58:48,609 --> 00:58:50,067
Grinch-less?

729
00:58:50,694 --> 00:58:53,237
Merry Christmas!

730
00:58:53,989 --> 00:58:56,324
Merry Christmas!

731
00:59:00,329 --> 00:59:04,290
I just wanted everybody
to be together for Christmas.

732
00:59:07,461 --> 00:59:11,547
I quite enjoyed that.
I hope I get
another invite soon.

733
00:59:16,803 --> 00:59:18,179
Come on, come on!

734
00:59:18,263 --> 00:59:20,431
Good thing we have a spare.

735
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:25,645
Suffering snorkelblatz!

736
00:59:26,104 --> 00:59:28,231
They're relentless!

737
00:59:33,737 --> 00:59:37,198
Only four hours
till Christmas!

738
00:59:39,201 --> 00:59:41,369
Yes, the Grinch knew tomorrow

739
00:59:41,453 --> 00:59:44,830
all the Who girls and boys
would wake bright and early

740
00:59:44,915 --> 00:59:46,499
and rush for their toys.

741
00:59:46,583 --> 00:59:49,710
And then, oh, the noise!

742
00:59:49,795 --> 00:59:53,339
Oh, the noise, noise,
noise, noise!

743
00:59:54,174 --> 00:59:56,259
They'll bang
on tong-tinglers.

744
00:59:56,343 --> 00:59:58,761
They'll blow
their floo-flounders.

745
00:59:58,845 --> 01:00:02,932
They'll crash on jang-jinglers
and bounce on boing-bounders!

746
01:00:03,016 --> 01:00:06,978
Then Whos young
and old would sit down
to a feast,

747
01:00:07,062 --> 01:00:09,814
and they'll feast
and they'll feast.

748
01:00:10,107 --> 01:00:13,359
And they'll feast, feast,
feast, feast!

749
01:00:13,902 --> 01:00:16,070
They'll eat their Who-pudding,

750
01:00:16,154 --> 01:00:19,782
and rare Who roast beast!

751
01:00:20,284 --> 01:00:24,203
But there's something I just
cannot stand in the least.

752
01:00:24,705 --> 01:00:25,955
Oh, no.

753
01:00:26,290 --> 01:00:29,875
I'm speaking in rhyme!

754
01:00:35,007 --> 01:00:38,467
Blast you Whos!

755
01:00:42,723 --> 01:00:46,892
And the more
the Grinch thought of
what Christmas would bring,

756
01:00:47,144 --> 01:00:49,478
the more the Grinch thought...

757
01:00:49,730 --> 01:00:52,398
I must stop this whole thing.

758
01:00:54,026 --> 01:00:57,820
Why, for year after year
I've put up with it now!

759
01:00:58,196 --> 01:01:00,823
I must stop this Christmas
from coming!

760
01:01:00,907 --> 01:01:02,283
But how?

761
01:01:02,909 --> 01:01:05,202
I mean, in what way?

762
01:01:08,123 --> 01:01:12,251
Well, Christmas is
goin' to the dogs

763
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:18,132
We're scarfing down
the turkey and the grog

764
01:01:24,306 --> 01:01:27,808
Are you having a holly, jolly

765
01:01:28,393 --> 01:01:30,019
Christmas?

766
01:01:31,855 --> 01:01:33,439
Wrong-o!

767
01:01:51,291 --> 01:01:53,542
If you're not
going to help me,

768
01:01:53,627 --> 01:01:55,628
then you might as well...

769
01:01:56,755 --> 01:02:00,800
Then he got an idea.
An awful idea.

770
01:02:01,968 --> 01:02:04,136
The Grinch got a wonderful,

771
01:02:04,596 --> 01:02:06,514
awful idea.

772
01:02:06,890 --> 01:02:11,143
I know just what to do.

773
01:02:19,820 --> 01:02:22,196
The Grinch laughed
in his throat.

774
01:02:23,073 --> 01:02:26,075
And he made a quick
Santy Claus hat and a coat.

775
01:02:28,829 --> 01:02:31,414
And he chuckled and clucked

776
01:02:31,957 --> 01:02:34,083
at this great Grinchy trick.

777
01:02:34,209 --> 01:02:38,087
With this coat and this hat,
I'll look just like St. Nick.

778
01:02:38,171 --> 01:02:40,005
Ho-ho-ho!

779
01:02:40,132 --> 01:02:43,426
You're a mean one
Mr. Grinch

780
01:02:44,719 --> 01:02:48,139
You really are a heel

781
01:02:49,141 --> 01:02:53,102
You're as cuddly as a cactus
and as charming as an eel

782
01:02:53,186 --> 01:02:55,729
Mr. Grinch

783
01:02:56,565 --> 01:02:59,442
You're a bad banana with a

784
01:02:59,526 --> 01:03:03,028
Greasy black peel

785
01:03:07,868 --> 01:03:11,245
Just face the music
You're a monster

786
01:03:11,538 --> 01:03:13,956
Mr. Grinch
Yes, you are

787
01:03:14,374 --> 01:03:18,669
Your heart's an empty hole

788
01:03:18,753 --> 01:03:22,840
Your brain is full of spiders
You got garlic in your soul

789
01:03:22,924 --> 01:03:25,718
Mr. Grinch

790
01:03:26,219 --> 01:03:28,971
I wouldn't touch you with a

791
01:03:29,639 --> 01:03:34,894
Thirty-nine
and a half-foot pole

792
01:03:44,905 --> 01:03:48,199
I asked for three-quarters,
not five-eighths.

793
01:03:48,283 --> 01:03:49,783
Stay focused!

794
01:03:56,082 --> 01:03:59,418
You know, if you asked
the Who's Who of Whoville...

795
01:04:00,754 --> 01:04:05,090
No one would deny it

796
01:04:24,194 --> 01:04:26,820
Air bag's a little slow.

797
01:04:29,074 --> 01:04:31,450
But that's what these tests
are for!

798
01:04:32,452 --> 01:04:35,037
You're a vile one

799
01:04:35,121 --> 01:04:36,455
Mr. Grinch

800
01:04:37,541 --> 01:04:41,627
You have termites
in your smile

801
01:04:42,128 --> 01:04:44,588
You have
all the tender sweetness

802
01:04:44,673 --> 01:04:46,757
Of a seasick crocodile

803
01:04:46,841 --> 01:04:49,635
Mr. Grinch

804
01:04:50,136 --> 01:04:53,472
Given the choice between you
I'd take the

805
01:04:53,723 --> 01:04:59,478
Seasick crocodile

806
01:05:18,665 --> 01:05:22,334
Fat boy should be finishing up
anytime now.

807
01:05:23,295 --> 01:05:25,212
Talk about a recluse.

808
01:05:25,338 --> 01:05:29,800
He only comes out once a year,
and he never catches
any flak for it!

809
01:05:31,052 --> 01:05:33,846
Probably lives up there
to avoid the taxes.

810
01:05:35,890 --> 01:05:38,726
Merry Christmas!

811
01:05:40,145 --> 01:05:41,520
Oopsie.

812
01:05:42,689 --> 01:05:44,732
Forgot about the reindeer.

813
01:05:45,734 --> 01:05:48,360
Did that
stop the old Grinch?

814
01:05:48,778 --> 01:05:50,321
No.

815
01:05:50,864 --> 01:05:53,115
The Grinch simply said...

816
01:05:53,325 --> 01:05:56,035
If I can't find a reindeer,

817
01:05:56,745 --> 01:05:59,788
I'll make one instead.

818
01:06:04,377 --> 01:06:07,463
Oh, Max!

819
01:06:11,217 --> 01:06:13,802
So he called
his dog Max,

820
01:06:13,887 --> 01:06:15,888
and he took some red thread,

821
01:06:16,056 --> 01:06:19,725
and tied a big horn
on top of his head.

822
01:06:23,104 --> 01:06:24,438
All right.

823
01:06:24,814 --> 01:06:26,899
You're a reindeer.
Here's your motivation.

824
01:06:27,901 --> 01:06:30,944
Your name is Rudolph. You're
a freak with a red nose,
and nobody likes you.

825
01:06:31,029 --> 01:06:34,406
Then one day, Santa picks you
and you save Christmas.

826
01:06:36,242 --> 01:06:38,869
No, forget that part.
We'll improvise.

827
01:06:38,953 --> 01:06:41,330
Just keep it
kinda loosey-goosey.

828
01:06:41,414 --> 01:06:43,916
You hate Christmas!
You're gonna steal it!

829
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:47,753
Saving Christmas
was a lousy ending.
Way too commercial.

830
01:06:48,922 --> 01:06:50,130
Action!

831
01:06:53,093 --> 01:06:54,551
Brilliant!

832
01:06:54,636 --> 01:06:56,762
You reject your own nose

833
01:06:56,846 --> 01:06:59,473
because it represents
the glitter of commercialism!

834
01:06:59,557 --> 01:07:01,392
Why didn't I think of that?

835
01:07:01,476 --> 01:07:04,103
Cut, print, check the gate.
Moving on.

836
01:07:13,655 --> 01:07:18,492
That feels good.

837
01:07:30,130 --> 01:07:32,798
Here goes nothing, hot dog!

838
01:07:38,471 --> 01:07:39,638
Wow.

839
01:07:53,820 --> 01:07:56,321
This is nuts!

840
01:07:58,324 --> 01:08:00,701
On Crasher! On Thrasher!

841
01:08:00,785 --> 01:08:03,245
On Vomit and Blitzkrieg!

842
01:08:11,713 --> 01:08:13,297
We're gonna die!

843
01:08:13,381 --> 01:08:15,215
We're gonna die!

844
01:08:15,425 --> 01:08:19,011
I'm going to throw up,
and then I'm gonna die!

845
01:08:21,014 --> 01:08:24,558
Mommy, tell it to stop!

846
01:08:43,369 --> 01:08:45,704
Almost lost my cool there.

847
01:08:51,252 --> 01:08:55,506
All their windows
were dark.
Quiet snow filled the air.

848
01:08:55,590 --> 01:08:59,635
All the Whos were all dreaming
sweet dreams without care,

849
01:09:00,011 --> 01:09:02,805
when he came
to the first little house
on the square.

850
01:09:02,889 --> 01:09:04,890
Welcome to Whoville, Max.

851
01:09:12,774 --> 01:09:13,941
Betty?

852
01:09:14,067 --> 01:09:15,484
Betty?
What?

853
01:09:15,568 --> 01:09:17,486
Did you hear something?

854
01:09:19,489 --> 01:09:20,781
It's Santa!

855
01:09:20,865 --> 01:09:22,741
Go right back to sleep.

856
01:09:28,164 --> 01:09:31,416
Come on, Max.
It's our first stop.

857
01:09:31,751 --> 01:09:34,002
The old Grinchy Claus hissed,

858
01:09:34,087 --> 01:09:37,005
and he climbed to the roof,
empty bags in his fist.

859
01:09:37,090 --> 01:09:40,425
He'd slide down the chimney,
a rather tight pinch,

860
01:09:40,635 --> 01:09:43,929
but if Santa could do it,
then so could the Grinch.

861
01:09:44,138 --> 01:09:47,266
He's planning
a double-twisting interrupted
forward-flying two-and-a-half,

862
01:09:47,350 --> 01:09:49,351
with a combo tuck and pike.

863
01:09:49,561 --> 01:09:51,478
High degree of difficulty.

864
01:09:59,279 --> 01:10:02,656
He got stuck
only once,
for a moment or two.

865
01:10:02,740 --> 01:10:06,618
Blasted water weight!
Goes right to my hips.

866
01:10:16,337 --> 01:10:19,715
Then he stuck
his head out
of the fireplace flue.

867
01:10:20,592 --> 01:10:23,010
A little more stealth, please.

868
01:10:23,177 --> 01:10:25,721
Where the little Who
stockings all hung in a row.

869
01:10:25,805 --> 01:10:27,848
- These stockings...
- He grinned.

870
01:10:27,932 --> 01:10:29,975
...are the first thing to go.

871
01:10:30,435 --> 01:10:32,978
Okay, fellas. Chow time.

872
01:11:04,636 --> 01:11:06,803
Then he slunk
to the icebox.

873
01:11:07,972 --> 01:11:09,431
Slunk?

874
01:11:11,351 --> 01:11:13,769
He eyed
the Whos' feast.

875
01:11:14,145 --> 01:11:16,063
He took the Who-pudding.

876
01:11:16,522 --> 01:11:18,815
He took the roast beast.

877
01:11:19,108 --> 01:11:20,359
Hike!

878
01:11:21,694 --> 01:11:23,862
He cleaned out that icebox
as quick as a flash.

879
01:11:23,947 --> 01:11:27,908
Why, that Grinch,
he even took their last can
of Who-hash.

880
01:11:28,952 --> 01:11:32,788
Then he stuffed all the food
up the chimney with glee.

881
01:11:33,247 --> 01:11:36,625
- And now...
- Grinned the Grinch.

882
01:11:39,003 --> 01:11:40,504
...I'll stuff up the tree.

883
01:11:40,588 --> 01:11:44,174
And the Grinch
grabbed the tree,
and he started to shove,

884
01:11:44,342 --> 01:11:47,928
when he heard a small sound
like the coo of a dove.

885
01:11:48,137 --> 01:11:49,471
Excuse me.

886
01:11:55,478 --> 01:11:58,814
The Grinch had been caught
by this tiny Who daughter,

887
01:11:58,898 --> 01:12:01,483
who'd got out of bed
for a cup of cold water.

888
01:12:01,567 --> 01:12:05,195
Santa Claus? What are you
doing with our tree?

889
01:12:05,571 --> 01:12:09,366
But, you know, that old Grinch
was so smart and so slick,

890
01:12:11,244 --> 01:12:14,246
he thought up a lie,
and he thought it up quick.

891
01:12:14,539 --> 01:12:18,834
Why,
my sweet little tot.

892
01:12:18,918 --> 01:12:21,003
The fake Santa Claus lied.

893
01:12:21,087 --> 01:12:26,008
There's a light on this tree
that won't light

894
01:12:26,092 --> 01:12:27,551
on one side.

895
01:12:28,011 --> 01:12:32,055
So I'm taking it home
to my workshop, my dear.

896
01:12:37,186 --> 01:12:39,271
I'll fix it up there,

897
01:12:39,772 --> 01:12:42,858
and I'll bring it back here.

898
01:12:45,236 --> 01:12:47,237
Santa, what's Christmas
really about?

899
01:12:47,321 --> 01:12:48,780
Vengeance!

900
01:12:51,034 --> 01:12:52,284
I mean,

901
01:12:54,871 --> 01:12:56,204
presents,

902
01:12:57,165 --> 01:12:59,291
I suppose.

903
01:13:02,837 --> 01:13:04,671
I was afraid of that.

904
01:13:06,257 --> 01:13:09,426
And his fib
fooled the child.

905
01:13:09,719 --> 01:13:13,055
Then he patted her head,
and he got her a drink,

906
01:13:13,139 --> 01:13:15,057
and he sent her to bed.

907
01:13:23,316 --> 01:13:25,692
Santa?
What?

908
01:13:26,152 --> 01:13:28,111
Don't forget the Grinch.

909
01:13:28,988 --> 01:13:31,782
I know he's mean and hairy
and smelly.

910
01:13:32,992 --> 01:13:35,494
His hands might be cold
and clammy.

911
01:13:36,996 --> 01:13:40,665
But I think he's actually
kind of...sweet.

912
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:42,209
Sweet?

913
01:13:49,717 --> 01:13:51,510
You think he's sweet?

914
01:13:52,303 --> 01:13:54,346
Merry Christmas, Santa.

915
01:14:01,187 --> 01:14:04,189
And when Cindy Lou
went up with her cup...

916
01:14:04,273 --> 01:14:05,607
Nice kid.

917
01:14:06,859 --> 01:14:08,819
Bad judge of character.

918
01:14:10,571 --> 01:14:13,698
...he went to the chimney
and stuffed the tree up.

919
01:14:21,499 --> 01:14:24,793
And the last thing he took
was the log for their fire.

920
01:14:24,877 --> 01:14:28,839
On their walls he left nothing
but some hooks and some wire.

921
01:14:29,257 --> 01:14:31,967
And the one speck of food
that he'd left in the house,

922
01:14:32,051 --> 01:14:35,887
was a crumb that was
even too small for a mouse.

923
01:14:38,599 --> 01:14:42,894
Then he slithered and slunk,
with a smile most unpleasant,

924
01:14:42,979 --> 01:14:46,565
around each Who home,
and he took every present.

925
01:14:57,952 --> 01:15:01,163
Clearance sale.
Everything must go.

926
01:15:13,718 --> 01:15:15,760
What now?

927
01:15:51,714 --> 01:15:52,881
Martha,

928
01:15:52,965 --> 01:15:56,927
have you ever kissed a man
who lost his tonsils twice?

929
01:15:58,012 --> 01:16:00,096
No, silly.

930
01:16:03,851 --> 01:16:07,729
But it's an experience
that I've always longed for.

931
01:16:07,813 --> 01:16:09,856
Kiss me, you fool.

932
01:17:32,481 --> 01:17:34,441
What are you laughing at,

933
01:17:35,234 --> 01:17:36,943
Rudolph?

934
01:17:38,237 --> 01:17:40,447
It's all you, Maxie!

935
01:17:40,531 --> 01:17:43,825
Three thousand feet up,
up the side of Mt. Crumpit,

936
01:17:43,909 --> 01:17:47,912
he rode with his load
to the tiptop to dump it.

937
01:17:50,374 --> 01:17:52,208
Whoa!

938
01:17:57,506 --> 01:18:01,343
We did it!

939
01:18:06,015 --> 01:18:07,932
We did it! We did it!

940
01:18:08,601 --> 01:18:10,852
That wasn't so bad,
was it, Max?

941
01:18:14,273 --> 01:18:16,399
They'll be waking up now.

942
01:18:18,444 --> 01:18:22,238
And I know
just what they'll do.

943
01:18:23,074 --> 01:18:25,116
All those Whos,

944
01:18:25,576 --> 01:18:27,285
down in Whoville,

945
01:18:27,370 --> 01:18:29,704
will all cry...

946
01:18:31,165 --> 01:18:34,125
Boo-hoo

947
01:18:34,794 --> 01:18:37,921
Boo-hoo

948
01:18:38,255 --> 01:18:41,424
Boo-hoo

949
01:18:42,468 --> 01:18:46,346
Boo-hoo

950
01:18:47,807 --> 01:18:50,475
What an embarrassment!
I've been robbed!

951
01:19:20,464 --> 01:19:22,841
Mayor May Who? Oh, dear.

952
01:19:29,849 --> 01:19:33,393
Well, I wonder
who could've done this.

953
01:19:35,146 --> 01:19:37,188
Tell you people one thing.

954
01:19:37,314 --> 01:19:38,982
Invite the Grinch,

955
01:19:39,358 --> 01:19:41,192
destroy Christmas.

956
01:19:41,652 --> 01:19:46,656
Invite the Grinch,
destroy Christmas!

957
01:19:49,660 --> 01:19:52,370
But did anyone listen to me?

958
01:19:52,455 --> 01:19:54,372
I did.
No!

959
01:19:54,582 --> 01:19:58,293
You choose to listen
to a little

960
01:19:58,377 --> 01:20:02,005
not-to-be-taken-seriously
girl,

961
01:20:03,048 --> 01:20:05,967
who hasn't even grown
into her nose yet.

962
01:20:07,887 --> 01:20:12,765
Cindy, I hope
you're very proud
of what you've done.

963
01:20:21,734 --> 01:20:23,526
If she isn't, I am.

964
01:20:25,529 --> 01:20:27,780
I'm glad he took our presents.

965
01:20:29,366 --> 01:20:31,367
What?
I...

966
01:20:32,703 --> 01:20:34,913
Well, I'm glad.

967
01:20:35,206 --> 01:20:37,665
He's glad. You're glad.

968
01:20:37,750 --> 01:20:40,210
You're glad
everything is gone.

969
01:20:41,128 --> 01:20:43,379
You're glad that the Grinch

970
01:20:43,797 --> 01:20:45,340
virtually wrecked...

971
01:20:45,424 --> 01:20:47,884
No, no, no, no, not wrecked,
pulverized Christmas.

972
01:20:47,968 --> 01:20:50,345
Is that what I'm hearing
from you, Lou?

973
01:20:50,721 --> 01:20:52,889
You can't hurt Christmas,
Mr. Mayor,

974
01:20:52,973 --> 01:20:57,143
because it isn't about
the gifts or the contests
or the fancy lights.

975
01:20:57,228 --> 01:21:00,438
That's what Cindy's
been trying to tell everyone.

976
01:21:00,940 --> 01:21:03,191
And me. She's been
trying to tell me.

977
01:21:03,275 --> 01:21:06,611
What is wrong with you?
This is a child.

978
01:21:07,613 --> 01:21:09,113
She's my child.

979
01:21:09,198 --> 01:21:11,783
And she happens to be right,
by the way.

980
01:21:20,626 --> 01:21:25,088
I don't need anything more
for Christmas than this
right here, my family.

981
01:21:28,217 --> 01:21:31,511
Merry Christmas,
everybody!
Merry Christmas!

982
01:21:33,013 --> 01:21:34,389
Merry Christmas,

983
01:21:34,473 --> 01:21:36,975
you hunk of burnin' Who!

984
01:21:44,024 --> 01:21:45,817
Oh, give me a break.

985
01:21:52,950 --> 01:21:54,867
Merry Christmas!

986
01:22:07,631 --> 01:22:09,007
Mr. Grinch?

987
01:22:10,175 --> 01:22:11,551
Mr. Grinch?

988
01:22:12,177 --> 01:22:15,346
Now for the final note
in my symphony

989
01:22:15,514 --> 01:22:18,266
of downright
nasty not-niceness!

990
01:22:18,517 --> 01:22:21,394
The crescendo
of my odious opus!

991
01:22:21,854 --> 01:22:23,313
Yes!

992
01:22:27,192 --> 01:22:30,570
Oh, the wailing
and the gnashing of teeth.

993
01:22:31,030 --> 01:22:35,283
The bellowing
of the bitterly bummed out!

994
01:22:35,868 --> 01:22:39,454
It'll be like music
to my ears!

995
01:22:44,627 --> 01:22:47,295
Welcome, Christmas
come this way

996
01:22:47,379 --> 01:22:51,341
Then the Grinch
heard a sound rising
over the snow.

997
01:22:51,717 --> 01:22:55,345
It started in low,
then it started to grow.

998
01:22:58,140 --> 01:23:00,642
But the sound wasn't sad.

999
01:23:01,268 --> 01:23:03,728
Why, this sounded merry.

1000
01:23:04,897 --> 01:23:08,066
But it was merry. Very.

1001
01:23:08,859 --> 01:23:12,570
Every Who down in Whoville,
the tall and the small,

1002
01:23:12,821 --> 01:23:16,074
were singing without
any presents at all.

1003
01:23:22,122 --> 01:23:26,042
He hadn't stopped Christmas
from coming. It came.

1004
01:23:26,126 --> 01:23:29,671
Somehow or other,
it came just the same!

1005
01:23:33,258 --> 01:23:34,676
Mr. Grinch?

1006
01:23:37,680 --> 01:23:41,349
And the Grinch,
with his Grinch feet ice-cold
in the snow,

1007
01:23:41,433 --> 01:23:44,435
stood puzzling and puzzling.

1008
01:23:44,603 --> 01:23:46,437
How could it be so?

1009
01:23:47,022 --> 01:23:48,981
It came without ribbons!

1010
01:23:49,274 --> 01:23:51,109
It came without tags!

1011
01:23:51,944 --> 01:23:55,321
It came without packages,
boxes or bags!

1012
01:23:58,283 --> 01:24:01,077
And he puzzled and puzzled,

1013
01:24:01,203 --> 01:24:03,246
till his puzzler was sore.

1014
01:24:06,125 --> 01:24:09,711
Then the Grinch
thought of something

1015
01:24:10,045 --> 01:24:11,671
he hadn't before.

1016
01:24:12,131 --> 01:24:15,466
Maybe Christmas...

1017
01:24:15,801 --> 01:24:17,135
He thought.

1018
01:24:20,055 --> 01:24:23,683
...doesn't come from a store.

1019
01:24:27,521 --> 01:24:29,147
Maybe Christmas,

1020
01:24:30,482 --> 01:24:31,774
perhaps,

1021
01:24:37,823 --> 01:24:40,116
means a little bit more.

1022
01:25:11,940 --> 01:25:13,191
Max!

1023
01:25:13,692 --> 01:25:15,193
Help me!

1024
01:25:16,028 --> 01:25:17,195
I'm

1025
01:25:18,238 --> 01:25:20,031
feeling!

1026
01:25:26,538 --> 01:25:28,372
And what happened then...

1027
01:25:28,874 --> 01:25:31,375
Well, in Whoville they say

1028
01:25:31,668 --> 01:25:33,961
that the Grinch's small heart,

1029
01:25:34,463 --> 01:25:37,882
grew three sizes that day.

1030
01:26:09,957 --> 01:26:12,917
What's happening to me?

1031
01:26:36,525 --> 01:26:37,942
I'm all

1032
01:26:39,236 --> 01:26:41,112
toasty inside.

1033
01:26:48,161 --> 01:26:50,329
And I'm leaking.

1034
01:26:53,834 --> 01:26:55,543
Oh, Max.

1035
01:26:58,297 --> 01:27:00,590
I love ya!

1036
01:27:08,557 --> 01:27:11,726
All right, that's enough.
Knock it off. Beat it!

1037
01:27:12,811 --> 01:27:15,730
Get out of here!
One step at a time.

1038
01:27:24,448 --> 01:27:27,491
Oh, no. The sleigh.
The presents.

1039
01:27:27,826 --> 01:27:30,369
They'll be destroyed!
And I care!

1040
01:27:30,871 --> 01:27:33,748
What is the deal?

1041
01:27:34,541 --> 01:27:35,666
Wait!

1042
01:27:37,336 --> 01:27:38,753
This can't happen.

1043
01:27:38,837 --> 01:27:41,839
It shouldn't! It couldn't!
It mustn't! It wouldn't!

1044
01:27:42,674 --> 01:27:45,259
Not now, not then,
not ever again!

1045
01:27:55,562 --> 01:27:58,189
No!

1046
01:28:37,145 --> 01:28:39,897
Boo-hoo!

1047
01:28:46,279 --> 01:28:47,571
Oh, well.

1048
01:28:48,073 --> 01:28:50,908
It's just toys, right?

1049
01:28:51,994 --> 01:28:53,536
Hi, Mr. Grinch.

1050
01:28:55,831 --> 01:28:57,665
Cindy Lou!

1051
01:28:57,749 --> 01:29:00,376
What are you doing up there?

1052
01:29:00,585 --> 01:29:02,253
I came to see you.

1053
01:29:02,587 --> 01:29:04,755
No one should be alone
on Christmas.

1054
01:29:21,189 --> 01:29:22,231
No!

1055
01:29:53,305 --> 01:29:56,724
I got ya, Cindy Lou!

1056
01:29:56,892 --> 01:29:58,309
You did it!

1057
01:30:39,559 --> 01:30:42,311
Spread eagle! Nailed it!

1058
01:30:59,704 --> 01:31:03,040
Are you all right?
Are you kidding?

1059
01:31:03,208 --> 01:31:05,626
The sun is bright
and the powder's bitching!

1060
01:31:05,710 --> 01:31:08,379
Now scoot over!
It's my turn to drive!

1061
01:31:15,887 --> 01:31:18,264
I'd better slow
this puppy down!

1062
01:31:21,810 --> 01:31:23,185
We're gonna crash!

1063
01:31:23,270 --> 01:31:25,563
Now you listen to me,
young lady!

1064
01:31:25,647 --> 01:31:28,232
Even if we're
horribly mangled,

1065
01:31:28,984 --> 01:31:31,402
there'll be no sad faces
on Christmas.

1066
01:31:43,123 --> 01:31:45,207
- What is it?
- Help!

1067
01:31:45,292 --> 01:31:47,418
Cindy!
Grinch?

1068
01:31:49,671 --> 01:31:50,921
My baby!

1069
01:31:55,177 --> 01:31:56,677
Oh, Martha, grab an end.

1070
01:31:56,761 --> 01:31:59,680
By the way, these lights match
your outfit perfectly.

1071
01:32:02,058 --> 01:32:04,393
This could be a little more
difficult to negotiate.

1072
01:32:04,477 --> 01:32:06,937
Heads up, Whoville!

1073
01:32:07,022 --> 01:32:09,982
Hurry!
Here he comes!

1074
01:32:10,066 --> 01:32:13,027
Outta the way!
I have no insurance!

1075
01:32:15,614 --> 01:32:17,615
Yeah!

1076
01:32:24,247 --> 01:32:27,374
Run for your lives!
Watch out, I can't stop!

1077
01:32:29,461 --> 01:32:32,254
Daddy, move!
Dad, move it!

1078
01:32:42,933 --> 01:32:44,308
Thanks for the help, Lou.

1079
01:32:44,392 --> 01:32:46,393
Hi, Daddy!
Hi, Cindy, honey.

1080
01:32:46,478 --> 01:32:48,896
Merry Christmas,

1081
01:32:48,980 --> 01:32:50,856
one and all!

1082
01:32:50,941 --> 01:32:52,107
Cindy!

1083
01:32:53,652 --> 01:32:54,818
Mommy!

1084
01:32:55,487 --> 01:32:57,488
Merry Christmas.

1085
01:32:58,323 --> 01:32:59,490
Cindy!

1086
01:33:02,953 --> 01:33:04,245
All right.

1087
01:33:05,163 --> 01:33:07,373
What do we have here?

1088
01:33:08,333 --> 01:33:10,834
You got me, Officer!

1089
01:33:11,753 --> 01:33:13,045
I did it!

1090
01:33:13,129 --> 01:33:16,048
I'm the Grinch
that stole Christmas.

1091
01:33:17,384 --> 01:33:20,261
And I'm...sorry.

1092
01:33:25,517 --> 01:33:27,268
Aren't you gonna cuff me?

1093
01:33:27,352 --> 01:33:30,854
Put me in a choke hold?
Blind me with pepper spray?

1094
01:33:30,939 --> 01:33:33,607
You heard him, Officer.
He admitted it.

1095
01:33:33,692 --> 01:33:35,776
I'd go with the pepper spray.

1096
01:33:35,860 --> 01:33:37,861
Yes, I heard him, all right.

1097
01:33:38,697 --> 01:33:40,739
He said he was sorry.

1098
01:33:42,367 --> 01:33:46,245
Besides, it looks like
everything is all here
and accounted for.

1099
01:33:46,371 --> 01:33:49,873
Help me out here, people.
Martha?

1100
01:33:49,958 --> 01:33:53,043
Merry Christmas,
Augustus May Who!

1101
01:33:53,878 --> 01:33:56,588
I'm afraid I do have
something for you.

1102
01:34:08,268 --> 01:34:09,852
Your ring back.

1103
01:34:10,395 --> 01:34:13,605
Sorry, but my heart belongs to

1104
01:34:14,816 --> 01:34:16,275
someone else.

1105
01:34:32,250 --> 01:34:34,084
No hard feelings?

1106
01:34:41,426 --> 01:34:43,052
Cheer up, dude.
It's Christmas.

1107
01:34:57,859 --> 01:35:00,110
Merry Christmas, Mr. Grinch.

1108
01:35:04,824 --> 01:35:06,658
Your cheek's so...

1109
01:35:06,743 --> 01:35:10,162
I know. Hairy?

1110
01:35:10,663 --> 01:35:12,956
No.
Greasy?

1111
01:35:13,333 --> 01:35:15,709
Stinky? Do I have a zit?

1112
01:35:15,919 --> 01:35:17,127
No.

1113
01:35:18,630 --> 01:35:20,172
Warm.

1114
01:35:26,805 --> 01:35:29,598
Fah who Foraze

1115
01:35:29,682 --> 01:35:31,934
Dah who Doraze

1116
01:35:32,018 --> 01:35:36,563
Welcome, Christmas
Come this way

1117
01:35:36,898 --> 01:35:39,316
Fah who Foraze

1118
01:35:39,401 --> 01:35:41,819
Dah who Doraze

1119
01:35:41,903 --> 01:35:46,782
Welcome, Christmas,
Christmas Day

1120
01:35:46,866 --> 01:35:51,745
Welcome, welcome
Fah who Ramus

1121
01:35:51,830 --> 01:35:56,667
Welcome, welcome
Dah who Damus

1122
01:35:56,835 --> 01:36:01,547
Christmas Day is in our grasp

1123
01:36:01,631 --> 01:36:06,427
So long as we have hands
to clasp

1124
01:36:06,678 --> 01:36:09,179
Fah who Ray Moo

1125
01:36:09,264 --> 01:36:11,765
Yah who Hee Haw

1126
01:36:11,850 --> 01:36:14,184
Welcome, Christmas

1127
01:36:14,269 --> 01:36:16,895
Bring your Cheer
Cheer

1128
01:36:16,980 --> 01:36:19,398
Fah who Foraze

1129
01:36:19,482 --> 01:36:21,733
Yah who Doraze

1130
01:36:21,818 --> 01:36:25,404
Welcome, all Whos Far

1131
01:36:26,823 --> 01:36:28,907
And

1132
01:36:29,742 --> 01:36:33,537
Near

1133
01:36:33,746 --> 01:36:37,291
So he brought back
the toys and the food
for the feast.

1134
01:36:37,375 --> 01:36:42,963
And he, he himself,
the Grinch,
carved the roast beast.

1135
01:36:43,047 --> 01:36:44,214
Yeah!

1136
01:36:58,855 --> 01:37:00,481
There's nothing
like the holidays.

1137
01:37:00,565 --> 01:37:02,983
- Who wants the gizzard?
- I do!

1138
01:37:03,067 --> 01:37:05,652
Too late! That'll be mine.

1139
01:37:05,737 --> 01:37:09,615
Where are you, Christmas

1140
01:37:09,908 --> 01:37:13,535
I think I've found you

1141
01:37:13,703 --> 01:37:19,416
This time I'll make you stay

1142
01:37:20,418 --> 01:37:24,046
All will be singing

1143
01:37:24,130 --> 01:37:27,758
Bells will be ringing

1144
01:37:27,926 --> 01:37:31,637
Now and forever

1145
01:37:31,721 --> 01:37:36,934
Christmas Day

1146
01:38:01,751 --> 01:38:06,046
Where are you, Christmas

1147
01:38:06,130 --> 01:38:09,883
Why can't I find you

1148
01:38:10,468 --> 01:38:15,973
Why have you gone away

1149
01:38:18,977 --> 01:38:23,397
Where is the laughter

1150
01:38:23,481 --> 01:38:27,734
You used to bring me

1151
01:38:27,819 --> 01:38:33,657
Why can't I hear music play

1152
01:38:36,661 --> 01:38:41,039
My world is changing

1153
01:38:41,124 --> 01:38:45,335
I'm rearranging

1154
01:38:45,420 --> 01:38:49,089
Does that mean Christmas

1155
01:38:49,173 --> 01:38:55,679
Changes too

1156
01:39:02,812 --> 01:39:07,065
Where are you, Christmas

1157
01:39:07,150 --> 01:39:11,445
Do you remember

1158
01:39:11,571 --> 01:39:17,743
The one you used to know

1159
01:39:20,371 --> 01:39:24,499
I'm not the same one

1160
01:39:24,584 --> 01:39:29,004
See what the time's done

1161
01:39:29,130 --> 01:39:32,633
Is that why you have

1162
01:39:32,717 --> 01:39:39,222
Let me go

1163
01:39:42,101 --> 01:39:45,354
Christmas is here

1164
01:39:45,438 --> 01:39:48,023
Everywhere

1165
01:39:50,818 --> 01:39:54,071
Christmas is here

1166
01:39:54,155 --> 01:39:57,824
If you care

1167
01:40:00,078 --> 01:40:02,829
If there is love

1168
01:40:02,914 --> 01:40:07,709
In your heart and your mind

1169
01:40:07,835 --> 01:40:14,341
You will feel like Christmas
all the time

1170
01:40:17,095 --> 01:40:21,348
I feel you, Christmas

1171
01:40:21,432 --> 01:40:25,727
I know I've found you

1172
01:40:25,812 --> 01:40:32,150
You never fade away

1173
01:40:34,612 --> 01:40:38,907
The joy of Christmas

1174
01:40:38,991 --> 01:40:43,370
Stays here in silence

1175
01:40:43,454 --> 01:40:48,500
Fills each and every heart

1176
01:40:50,628 --> 01:40:55,924
With love

1177
01:41:08,229 --> 01:41:10,355
They're makin' noise

1178
01:41:10,440 --> 01:41:13,150
Noise, noise, noise

1179
01:41:14,944 --> 01:41:17,988
How I hate their happy noise

1180
01:41:19,991 --> 01:41:22,909
There's only one thing
I hate more

1181
01:41:22,994 --> 01:41:25,370
Come to think of it

1182
01:41:25,455 --> 01:41:28,582
And that's the people who keep

1183
01:41:28,666 --> 01:41:30,208
Makin' it

1184
01:41:30,668 --> 01:41:33,795
Feast, feast, feast, feast

1185
01:41:35,923 --> 01:41:39,968
They'll have more
than anyone could ever eat

1186
01:41:41,053 --> 01:41:43,430
Me, I'm stuck here with my

1187
01:41:43,514 --> 01:41:45,766
Cream of wheat

1188
01:41:46,309 --> 01:41:49,144
There's no one here
to feast with me

1189
01:41:51,522 --> 01:41:54,858
On this lonely Christmas Eve

1190
01:41:56,903 --> 01:42:00,197
Don't they know
I'm up here all alone

1191
01:42:02,074 --> 01:42:04,868
In my cave up in the hills

1192
01:42:07,288 --> 01:42:10,832
How I wish that
this would go away

1193
01:42:10,917 --> 01:42:13,418
This dreadful holiday

1194
01:42:13,503 --> 01:42:17,047
That they call Christmas Day

1195
01:42:20,468 --> 01:42:26,223
It's a lonely Christmas Eve

1196
01:42:35,399 --> 01:42:38,777
The streets are filled
with Christmas cheer

1197
01:42:39,362 --> 01:42:42,906
At least it's only once a year

1198
01:42:43,533 --> 01:42:47,327
Perfect parcels tied
with perfect bows

1199
01:42:47,411 --> 01:42:50,914
And carols ringing in my ear

1200
01:42:51,415 --> 01:42:54,793
Bundled up against the cold

1201
01:42:55,336 --> 01:42:58,755
Lines wherever gifts are sold

1202
01:42:59,340 --> 01:43:03,343
Each shop window
displays a Christmas scene

1203
01:43:03,427 --> 01:43:07,013
For everybody young and old

1204
01:43:07,473 --> 01:43:10,809
Icicles on eaves troughs
and tinsel on the tree

1205
01:43:10,893 --> 01:43:14,354
But it's a green Christmas
for me

1206
01:43:17,358 --> 01:43:20,861
Couples skating on the pond

1207
01:43:21,404 --> 01:43:24,906
Makin' angels on the lawn

1208
01:43:25,366 --> 01:43:29,202
Five red mittens
drying on the rack

1209
01:43:29,287 --> 01:43:33,290
And needle-shedding Tannenbaum

1210
01:43:33,416 --> 01:43:36,835
Red bows on the railings
and snowflakes on the ground

1211
01:43:36,919 --> 01:43:41,089
But it's a green Christmas
in this town

1212
01:43:43,342 --> 01:43:44,926
Green

1213
01:43:45,011 --> 01:43:48,847
'Cause of everything I miss

1214
01:43:48,931 --> 01:43:52,142
All this mistletoe
No kiss

1215
01:43:52,935 --> 01:43:55,979
And with every Christmas wish

1216
01:43:56,856 --> 01:44:00,734
There would be no greater gift

1217
01:44:00,818 --> 01:44:03,987
Than to have this envy lift

1218
01:44:15,499 --> 01:44:19,252
Carolers are at my door

1219
01:44:19,337 --> 01:44:23,214
Don't wanna hear them anymore

1220
01:44:23,382 --> 01:44:26,885
Stockings on the mantel
The snow's here every day

1221
01:44:26,969 --> 01:44:30,931
But it's a
green Christmas anyway

1222
01:44:31,390 --> 01:44:34,768
Red nose on the reindeer
Tinsel on the tree

1223
01:44:34,852 --> 01:44:38,647
But it's a green Christmas
for me
