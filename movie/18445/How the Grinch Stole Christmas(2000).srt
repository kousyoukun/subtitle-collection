3
00:01:06,121 --> 00:01:07,880
银白的雪花
<i>Inside a snowflake, like the one on your sleeve...</i>

4
00:01:07,943 --> 00:01:10,104
片片地落下

5
00:01:10,178 --> 00:01:14,478
其中深藏着一个故事
<i>...there happened a story you must see to believe.</i>

6
00:01:30,699 --> 00:01:34,863
在遥远的松饼山上
<i>Way up in the mountains, in the high range of Pontoos...</i>

7
00:01:34,936 --> 00:01:37,200
有着一个小镇
<i>...lay the small town of Whoville:</i>

8
00:01:37,272 --> 00:01:40,901
片名：鬼灵精 那就是胡谷镇
<i>The home of the Whos.</i>

9
00:01:44,279 --> 00:01:47,180
随便问一位胡谷镇民
<i>Ask any Who, and they'll have this to say:</i>

10
00:01:47,249 --> 00:01:52,186
他们会告诉你 胡谷镇的圣诞节是最棒的
<i>"There is no place like Whoville around Christmas Day."</i>

11
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:55,189
到处张灯结彩、喜气洋洋
<i>Every window was flocked, every lamppost was dressed...</i>

12
00:01:55,257 --> 00:01:59,193
乐队换上了大礼服，穿街过市
<i>...and the Whoville band marched in their Christmasy best.</i>

13
00:02:04,599 --> 00:02:07,966
圣诞快乐，圣诞快乐
Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!

14
00:02:20,448 --> 00:02:23,246
植树节不错，复活节也很棒
<i>Arbor Day was fine, and Easter was pleasant...</i>

15
00:02:23,318 --> 00:02:26,685
每次圣泡沫节就吃泡沫雉
<i>...and every Saint Fizzin's day, they ate a Fizz pheasant.</i>

16
00:02:26,755 --> 00:02:30,748
但每位胡谷镇民打心眼知道
<i>But every Who knew, from their twelve toes to their snout...</i>

17
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:32,952
毫无疑问地
<i>...they loved Christmas the most, without a single Who doubt.</i>

18
00:02:33,028 --> 00:02:35,223
圣诞节才是他们的最爱

We got a snoozlephone for your brother Drew...

22

帮你二哥也买了电话
...and a snoozlephone for your brother Stu, a muncle for your uncle...

23
00:02:51,446 --> 00:02:53,641

裤子给你舅妈
...a fant for your aunt and a fandpa for your cousin Leon.

25
00:02:55,183 --> 00:02:57,651
皮鞋给你表哥

26
00:02:57,752 --> 00:02:59,947
我们只要再…辛蒂？
So, we just need... Cindy?

27
00:03:00,021 --> 00:03:01,648
特价品在三楼
<i>Sale on Aisle 3!</i>

28
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:03,657
辛蒂… 圣诞快乐
- Cindy Lou! - Merry Christmas.

29
00:03:03,725 --> 00:03:05,625
嗨，麦纳，圣诞快乐
Hello, Myrna. Merry Christmas, Fred. Excuse me.

30
00:03:05,694 --> 00:03:08,060
麻烦，借过 辛蒂？女儿
Cindy Lou? Honey?

31
00:03:09,164 --> 00:03:12,327
爸，是不是买太多了
- Dad? - Yeah?

32
00:03:10,411 --> 00:03:12,413
Doesn't this seem like a bit much?

33
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,834
圣诞节本来就该这样
This is what Christmas is all about!

34
00:03:14,936 --> 00:03:16,631
感觉到了吗？
Can't you feel it?

35
00:03:16,771 --> 00:03:17,635
圣诞快乐
Merry Christmas!

36
00:03:17,706 --> 00:03:20,334
多谢惠顾…等一下
Thank you for shopping Farfingle's. Wait a second!

37
00:03:20,408 --> 00:03:21,670
还没找钱
Your change!

38
00:03:21,743 --> 00:03:23,973
圣诞节越来越近了
Another minute closer to Christmas!

39
00:03:26,081 --> 00:03:29,915
圣诞大拍卖，限时五分钟
And, for the next five minutes only, 99 percent off!

40
00:03:42,631 --> 00:03:47,728
的确，胡谷镇的每位镇民 都喜欢圣诞节
<i>Yes, every Who down in Whoville liked Christmas a lot...</i>

41
00:03:47,802 --> 00:03:51,795
但住在胡谷镇以北的鬼灵精
<i>...but the Grinch, who lived just north of Whoville...</i>

42
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:54,474
正好相反
<i>...did not.</i>

43
00:03:57,112 --> 00:03:59,546
告诉你们，漂亮的w寄生在山顶
<i>Get on it, girls. All the good mistletoe's at the top.</i>

44
00:03:59,648 --> 00:04:02,139
朱朱，我们来比赛
<i>- Hey, Drew, I'll race you! - Not if I race you first.</i>

45
00:04:02,183 --> 00:04:06,586
你跑不赢我的 最慢的是猪头
Last one to the top is a stinky old Grinch!

46
00:04:08,723 --> 00:04:10,714
我们到底在哪？
You guys, where are we? I think we should go back.

47
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:14,751
还是回去算了 干嘛？你怕鬼灵精

48
00:04:12,389 --> 00:04:14,850
What? You're scared of the Grinch!

49
00:04:15,196 --> 00:04:16,458
才没有
No!

50
00:04:16,598 --> 00:04:19,294
听说他就住在山顶
They say he lives up here in a big cave.

51
00:04:19,367 --> 00:04:22,268
只有肚子饿的时候才会下山来…
And only comes down when he's hungry for the taste of...

52
00:04:22,337 --> 00:04:24,567
吃人  别闹了
- ...Who flesh! - Drew!

53
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:27,199
喂！  你怕鬼灵精
You're scared of the Grinch! You're scared of the Grinch!

54
00:04:27,242 --> 00:04:29,176
你怕鬼灵精

55
00:04:29,244 --> 00:04:30,677
“闲杂人”

56
00:04:30,779 --> 00:04:32,872
胆小鬼 才不是
- Are too! - Am not!

57
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:37,715
等我
Wait for me!

58
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:50,590
快点，快敲门
Go on, touch it. Touch the door.

59
00:04:50,665 --> 00:04:52,690
你不爱我吗？小史
Do it for me, Stu.

60
00:05:24,866 --> 00:05:26,925
干得好，麦斯
Well done, Max!

61
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:30,198
活该，爱过节的小鬼
Serves them right, those Yuletide-loving...

62
00:05:30,238 --> 00:05:33,571
叽叽喳喳、肉麻兮兮
...sickly-sweet, nog-sucking cheer mongers!

63
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:39,707
我讨厌他们，非常讨厌
I really don't like them.

64
00:05:38,975 --> 00:05:40,476
No, I don't.

65
00:05:42,984 --> 00:05:44,178
麦斯！
Max!

66
00:05:45,787 --> 00:05:48,881
拿我的披风来
Get my cloak!

67
00:05:48,957 --> 00:05:52,484
我对山下那群死白痴
I've been much too tolerant of these Whovenile delinquents...

68
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,755
已经够客气的了
...and their innocent, victimless pranks.

69
00:05:56,498 --> 00:05:59,763
他们想认识我，是不是
So, they want to get to know me, do they?

70
00:05:59,834 --> 00:06:03,201
他们想了解我，鬼灵精
They want to spend a little quality time with the Grinch.

71
00:06:04,539 --> 00:06:07,064
看来不出去晃晃
I guess I could use a little...

72
00:06:07,142 --> 00:06:09,133
是不行了
...social interaction.

73
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:20,117
圣诞快乐
Merry Christmas!

74
00:06:20,188 --> 00:06:23,487
是啊！你也一样 圣诞快乐个屁
Yeah, you bet.

75
00:06:21,892 --> 00:06:23,686
Ho, ho, ho, and stuff.

76
00:06:26,861 --> 00:06:30,695
天哪！有人出车祸了
Oh, my.

77
00:06:28,107 --> 00:06:30,818
Someone has vandalized that vehicle.

78
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:33,598
看到没？麦斯 马路如虎口
You see, Max? The city is a dangerous place.

79
00:06:33,668 --> 00:06:36,398
鬼灵精讨厌圣诞节
<i>The Grinch hated Christmas. The whole Christmas season.</i>

80
00:06:36,471 --> 00:06:40,202
你好啊！条子 不要问我为什么
Top of the day. Flatfoot.

81
00:06:38,033 --> 00:06:41,537
<i>Now, please, don't ask why. No one quite knows the reason.</i>

82
00:06:40,275 --> 00:06:42,709
因为没有人知道 小朋友，送给你们
Here's a present for you.

83
00:06:42,777 --> 00:06:46,110
不用慢慢走，用跑的，跑快点
Be sure to run real fast with it. Come on. Double time. Move.

84
00:06:46,181 --> 00:06:48,877
不是因为他有根筋不对劲
<i>It could be that his head wasn't screwed on just right.</i>

85
00:06:48,983 --> 00:06:52,419
就是因为他的鞋子太紧了
<i>Or it could be, perhaps, that his shoes were too tight.</i>

86
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:55,182
我认为唯一的可能… 圣诞快乐
<i>But I think that the most likely reason of all...</i>

87
00:06:55,256 --> 00:06:57,190
白痴 是他的心胸…
<i>...may have been that his heart was two sizes too small.</i>

88
00:06:57,258 --> 00:06:59,692
实在太狭窄了

89
00:06:59,761 --> 00:07:03,356
老兄，进来买顶帽子吧
<i>Stranger, won't let you go till you buy a chapeau!</i>

90
00:07:15,477 --> 00:07:17,502
圣诞节是不是很棒？
Boy, nothing beats Christmas, right?

91
00:07:18,313 --> 00:07:19,439
大概吧
I guess.

92
00:07:20,415 --> 00:07:21,814
大概？
You guess?

93
00:07:21,883 --> 00:07:27,014
因为我只看到你和妈 还有其他人大买特买
It's just, I look around at you and Mom and everyone getting all curbobbled.

94
00:07:27,088 --> 00:07:30,023
你不觉得夸张吗？
Doesn't this seem superfluous?

95
00:07:30,091 --> 00:07:31,080
爸爸！
Dad!

96
00:07:31,878 --> 00:07:33,547
Dad!

97
00:07:35,697 --> 00:07:38,928
你们怎么啦？ 碰到鬼灵精了
- What happened to you? - It was the Grinch!

98
00:07:44,539 --> 00:07:45,198
鬼灵精？
- Grinch? - What do you want? I mean...

99
00:07:45,273 --> 00:07:46,604
叫我干嘛？我是说…

100
00:07:46,741 --> 00:07:48,470
鬼灵精？好可怕！
"Grinch? Oh, no!"

101
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:52,772
是谁在说鬼灵精？
Did someone just say, "Grinch"?

102
00:07:53,781 --> 00:07:55,442
镇长大人，您好
Hello, Mayor May-Who, sir.

103
00:07:58,822 --> 00:07:59,864
Lou.

104
00:08:03,992 --> 00:08:07,018
我想你一定知道 今年的圣诞节
I don't need to remind you that this Christmas...

105
00:08:07,095 --> 00:08:09,529
正好是建镇一千年纪念
...marks the one thousandth Whobilation.

106
00:08:09,597 --> 00:08:13,465
是本镇最重要的日子 根据“胡谷镇民手册”
Whoville's most important celebration!

107
00:08:13,535 --> 00:08:15,901
上面写得非常清楚
<i>And The Book of Who says, very clearly:</i>

108
00:08:17,138 --> 00:08:19,470
镇民无论男女老幼
"Every size of Who we can measure...

109
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:24,240
都必须重视此一节日
"...knows that Whobilation is a time we must treasure."

110
00:08:24,345 --> 00:08:26,973
麻烦你告诉我
Now, Lou, please tell me that your boys...

111
00:08:27,081 --> 00:08:29,015
你儿子没有跑上山
...were not up on Mount Crumpit...

112
00:08:29,083 --> 00:08:34,350
骚扰那个住在松饼山峰 讨厌圣诞节的怪物
...provoking the one creature within a billion bilometers of here...

113
00:08:34,489 --> 00:08:36,423
可是真的是他…
...who hates Christmas!

114
00:08:34,732 --> 00:08:36,442
But it was the Grinch!

115
00:08:37,225 --> 00:08:40,524
误会，一场误会 他们啥都没看到
No, sir, the boys didn't see any Grinch.

116
00:08:42,163 --> 00:08:44,654
他们大概只是上山
It was, and he came after--

117
00:08:42,949 --> 00:08:45,076
I think they were up on the mountain...

118
00:08:44,732 --> 00:08:46,962
玩玩火柴、砍砍树什么的
...playing with matches, or defacing public property, or...

119
00:08:47,035 --> 00:08:49,503
太好了

120
00:08:49,571 --> 00:08:51,766
这样我就放心了
That's a relief.

121
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:56,071
各位，都听到啦 鬼灵精警报解除
All right, you heard the man:

122
00:08:53,501 --> 00:08:56,545
There is no Grinch problem here.

123
00:09:03,618 --> 00:09:05,552

爸，有一件事我不懂
But, Dad...

127
00:09:14,814 --> 00:09:16,607
...I just don't understand something.

128
00:09:16,598 --> 00:09:19,396
为什么大家都怕鬼灵精？
Why won't anyone talk about the Grinch?

129
00:09:20,168 --> 00:09:22,068
小孩就是小孩
You kids and the Grinch!

130
00:09:22,136 --> 00:09:26,766
辛蒂，鬼灵精是胡谷镇民
You see, Cindy, the Grinch is a Who, who always...

131
00:09:26,841 --> 00:09:30,174
也不能算是，那家伙…
Actually, not a Who. He's more of a...

132
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:33,873
怎样？ 对了，宝贝
- A what? - Exactly, honey.

133
00:09:33,982 --> 00:09:37,008
那家伙讨厌圣诞节
And he's a What who doesn't like Christmas.

134
00:09:37,885 --> 00:09:39,216
你看他的信箱
Take a look at his mailbox, sweetie.

135
00:09:39,988 --> 00:09:44,482
空的，连张圣诞卡都没有
Not a single Christmas card, in or out.

136
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:47,551
为什么呢？ 我的信呢？阿卢
Ever!

137
00:09:44,676 --> 00:09:45,803
But why?

138
00:09:45,928 --> 00:09:47,387
Lou, where's my mail?

139
00:09:47,629 --> 00:09:52,157
这封信不是我的 阿卢，送错信了
Lou! Got the wrong mail here.

140
00:09:50,098 --> 00:09:52,184
Lou! I got the wrong mail!

141
00:09:53,968 --> 00:09:56,994
我来了  出问题了
- I'll be right there. - Lou, we got a problem!

142
00:09:57,071 --> 00:09:59,471
别担心，我来搞定
All right, we'll straighten this out.

143
00:10:02,944 --> 00:10:06,209
他们得花几年才搞得定
It'll take them years to sort this out.

144
00:10:06,347 --> 00:10:08,645
他的送给你，你的送给她
This is his and now it's yours, and this hers and now it's his!

145
00:10:12,053 --> 00:10:15,545
至于其他人呢
And for the rest of you:

146
00:10:15,623 --> 00:10:17,614
法院通知、法院通知
Jury duty! Jury duty! Jury duty!

147
00:10:17,692 --> 00:10:20,559
恐吓信、解聘书 连锁信、逐客令
Blackmail. Pink slip. Chain letter. Eviction notice.

148
00:10:20,628 --> 00:10:22,596
法院通知
Jury duty!

149
00:10:27,268 --> 00:10:31,329
帮爸爸拿到后面好吗？
Would you mind helping me take this to the back room, honey?

150
00:10:31,406 --> 00:10:34,898
小心分信机哦 知道
- Be careful of the sorting machine, right? - Yeah.

151
00:11:11,846 --> 00:11:12,938
感冒啦…
<i>Gesundheit.</i>

152
00:11:21,856 --> 00:11:23,517
你是…是…
You're the...

153
00:11:23,591 --> 00:11:26,253
是…是…鬼灵精
The...

154
00:11:25,777 --> 00:11:26,861
The Grinch!

155
00:11:27,428 --> 00:11:28,918
救命！

156
00:11:28,996 --> 00:11:32,295
这招蛮管用的

157
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,391
救命啊！
That worked out nicely.

158
00:11:32,992 --> 00:11:34,327
Help!

159
00:11:39,907 --> 00:11:42,102
“小心轻放”

160
00:11:43,144 --> 00:11:46,272
快救我 我们走，麦斯
Help me! Somebody!

161
00:11:44,879 --> 00:11:46,339
Max, let's go.

162
00:11:46,414 --> 00:11:48,348
事情办完啦
Our work here is finished.

163
00:11:50,418 --> 00:11:52,477
求求你，救救我
Help me!

164
00:11:52,587 --> 00:11:55,351
我的屁屁可不是给你磨牙的
Please help!

165
00:11:53,262 --> 00:11:55,431
That is not a chew toy!

166
00:11:55,456 --> 00:11:58,220
别闹了，你有完没完
Stop it, Max!

167
00:11:58,292 --> 00:12:00,283
搞什么？很痛耶
Get that out of your mouth! You have no idea where it's been!

168
00:12:05,032 --> 00:12:06,260
救命啊！
Help!

169
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:13,364
不能见死不救
Bleeding hearts of the world, unite!

170
00:12:16,477 --> 00:12:17,808
上来

171
00:12:20,214 --> 00:12:23,081
好了，还来
There! Give me that!

172
00:12:23,151 --> 00:12:25,984
你没听过物归原主吗？
Don't you know you shouldn't take things that don't belong to you?

173
00:12:26,053 --> 00:12:28,351
干嘛？想占为己有啊？
What's your problem? Are you a wild animal?

174
00:12:31,192 --> 00:12:32,489
我们走
Let's go.

175
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:33,857
谢谢你救我
Thanks for saving me.

176
00:12:38,166 --> 00:12:40,964
“出口”

177
00:12:41,035 --> 00:12:43,765
救你？
Saving you?

178
00:12:43,838 --> 00:12:45,897
你以为我是要救你？
Is that what you think I was doing?

179
00:12:48,576 --> 00:12:50,100
错
Wrong-o.

180
00:12:52,947 --> 00:12:56,940
我是发现你包装不合格
I merely noticed that you were improperly packaged, my dear.

181
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:00,851
站好
Hold still!

182
00:13:00,922 --> 00:13:02,913
麦斯，拿缎带
Max, pick out a bow.

183
00:13:03,558 --> 00:13:06,186
手指借一下
Can I use your finger for a second?

184
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:08,160
有人在吗？
Hello! Hello!

185
00:13:12,867 --> 00:13:13,595
女儿？
- Cindy? - Dad!

186
00:13:13,668 --> 00:13:17,069
爸…

187
00:13:16,345 --> 00:13:17,596
Daddy!

188
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:21,030
怎么搞的？
Daddy!

189
00:13:20,057 --> 00:13:21,391
What the hey...?

190
00:13:22,043 --> 00:13:22,975
女儿
Honey.

191
00:13:25,913 --> 00:13:30,850
爸，太棒了 你在练习包装礼物
Cindy?

192
00:13:26,188 --> 00:13:27,647
Dad! It was amazing!

193
00:13:27,939 --> 00:13:31,026
You've been practicing your Christmas wrapping!

194
00:13:30,952 --> 00:13:35,252
我真是太高兴了 其实…
I am so proud of you.

195
00:13:35,323 --> 00:13:37,052
这才像过节嘛
Now, that's holiday.

196
00:13:37,124 --> 00:13:40,525
小辛蒂不知该如何是好
<i>Sweet little Cindy didn't know what to do.</i>

197
00:13:40,595 --> 00:13:43,723
她的心中充满了疑问
<i>In her head, bum-tumbled a conflict or two.</i>

198
00:13:43,798 --> 00:13:47,393
鬼灵精不是很坏吗？ 为什么还要救我？
<i>"If the Grinch was so bad, then why did he save me?</i>

199
00:13:47,468 --> 00:13:50,062
也许他并不是坏人 我们回家吧
<i>"Maybe he wasn't so bad."</i>

200
00:13:50,137 --> 00:13:52,071
也许，只是也许
<i>Maybe. Just maybe.</i>

201
00:13:56,878 --> 00:13:59,312
灯没开，你妈大概出去了
No lights on in the house. Your mom must be shopping.

202
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:01,245
太好了，你们回来了
Good, I'm so glad you're home.

203
00:14:01,315 --> 00:14:05,149
老公，我有预感，就是今年
I can feel it, Lou. This is the year.

204
00:14:05,219 --> 00:14:06,686
大家只要问到
When everybody asks who has the most spectacular lights in greater Whoville...

205
00:14:06,754 --> 00:14:09,689
谁家的圣诞灯饰最美丽

206
00:14:11,359 --> 00:14:14,920
就会说，贝蒂卢女士
...they're gonna cry out, "Mrs. Betty Lou Who!"

207
00:14:14,996 --> 00:14:17,863
这不是餐厅的吊灯吗？
Isn't this the chandelier from the dining room?

208
00:14:17,932 --> 00:14:20,025
你就委屈一下吧
It's all for the cause, dear.

209
00:14:20,101 --> 00:14:22,695
好吧 还有，女儿
And Cindy? Could you be Mommy's little helper...

210
00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:26,137
去帮妈妈把冰箱的灯泡拆下来
...and unscrew the bulb there from the refrigerator?

211
00:14:26,173 --> 00:14:29,233
我忘了拆 去吧
- 'Cause somehow I missed that one. - Go on!

212
00:14:33,714 --> 00:14:35,682
每一年
Every year Martha May Whovier has the best lights.

213
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:39,151
灯饰比赛都是梅玛莎赢

214
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:43,223
但是今年她别想
Not this year.

215
00:14:43,291 --> 00:14:46,886
我一定会打败那个三八…
This year...

216
00:14:43,431 --> 00:14:47,059
...I'm gonna beat that prim, perfect little prissy--

217
00:14:46,961 --> 00:14:50,453
贝蒂，嗨
Betty!

218
00:14:49,312 --> 00:14:52,273
- Hi! - Martha!

219
00:14:50,965 --> 00:14:52,159
玛莎

220
00:14:52,233 --> 00:14:56,465
天啊，这是我看过 最美丽的圣诞灯饰
My, I've never seen so many beautiful Christmas lights, Betty Lou!

221
00:14:56,537 --> 00:14:59,438
是啊，我是在向你看齐嘛
I'd blow every fuse if I tried to keep up with you, Martha May!

222
00:15:00,808 --> 00:15:05,211
是不是很漂亮？是手工做的
Isn't this antique darling?

223
00:15:03,659 --> 00:15:07,288
It's handcrafted and almost 100 years old.

224
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:07,213
这可是古董哦

225
00:15:08,983 --> 00:15:13,181
对啊，美死了 这可是新买的
Jeez. I'm really impressed!

226
00:15:11,042 --> 00:15:13,044
This, however, is new.

227
00:15:24,298 --> 00:15:26,664
喂，贝蒂，老婆
Betty! Sweetie!

228
00:15:43,317 --> 00:15:44,511
晚安啦，贝蒂
Good night, Betty.

229
00:15:49,991 --> 00:15:52,289
我接 老婆，我接了
- I got it! - Honey, I've got it.

230
00:15:52,541 --> 00:15:53,625
Hello?

231
00:15:54,929 --> 00:15:57,727
我的冷气机是不是坏了？
Is my sub-zero chillibrator running?

232
00:15:57,798 --> 00:16:01,234
没有吧 那你还不打开
- I suppose. - You better go catch it!

233
00:16:08,976 --> 00:16:12,139
笑死我了，我真幽默
That's a good one! That is rich.

234
00:16:15,383 --> 00:16:16,816
回家吧！
Let's go home.

235
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:24,817
不好意思，长幼有序
Fleas before beauty. Thank you.

236
00:16:28,496 --> 00:16:31,124
快点，慢吞吞的
Come on, hurry up, Slowpoke.

237
00:16:34,568 --> 00:16:37,401
“往松饼山垃圾场”

238
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:48,444
应该有别的捷径
There's got to be a better way!

239
00:17:10,004 --> 00:17:12,666
坐车就不用这么辛苦了
A car would have paid for itself by now!

240
00:17:14,842 --> 00:17:17,174
好耶，另外一批货
Goody. Another load coming down.

241
00:17:21,882 --> 00:17:23,907
哇，有够臭
What's that stench?

242
00:17:24,018 --> 00:17:25,952
正合我意
It's fantastic!

243
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:27,647
“危险废料”

244
00:17:29,223 --> 00:17:33,125
先拿一袋，剩下的待会再拿
Max! Grab a bag.

245
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:33,057
We'll come back for the rest.

246
00:17:33,194 --> 00:17:36,755
也就是说，待会你来拿
Of course, when I say "we," I mean "you."

247
00:17:36,831 --> 00:17:40,426
这些镇民有够浪费的
It's amazing what these Whos just throw away.

248
00:17:41,702 --> 00:17:42,691
反正咧
Oh, well.

249
00:17:42,803 --> 00:17:46,933
你丢我捡，废物利用
One man's toxic sludge is another man's potpourri.

250
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:48,941
罗唆，我是能省就省
I don't know. It's some kind of soap.

251
00:18:01,722 --> 00:18:05,419
为何不见
"Where are you, Christmas?

252
00:18:05,493 --> 00:18:09,520
圣诞影踪
"Why can't I find you?

253
00:18:09,597 --> 00:18:14,591
为何音讯全无
"Why have you gone away?

254
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:21,506
世界在变
"My world is changing

255
00:18:21,575 --> 00:18:25,443
我在改变
"I'm rearranging

256
00:18:25,546 --> 00:18:28,515
不知圣诞
"Does that mean Christmas

257
00:18:29,316 --> 00:18:33,218
是否依旧
"changes too?

258
00:18:33,287 --> 00:18:35,278
“圣诞老人 我不知道我要什么”

259
00:18:41,562 --> 00:18:45,259
为何不见
"Where are you, Christmas?

260
00:18:45,332 --> 00:18:48,768
圣诞影踪
"Do you remember

261
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:53,702
是否忘了我
"The girl you used to know?

262
00:18:56,177 --> 00:18:58,145
过去
"You and I were so carefree

263
00:18:58,212 --> 00:19:01,204
美好回忆

264
00:19:01,315 --> 00:19:04,648
仍在梦中
"Now nothing's easy

265
00:19:04,718 --> 00:19:08,518
不知圣诞
"Did Christmas change

266
00:19:08,589 --> 00:19:14,721
是否
"Or just

267
00:19:14,795 --> 00:19:19,357
依旧
"me?"

268
00:19:46,727 --> 00:19:48,160
厉害
Sweet!

269
00:19:57,638 --> 00:20:01,597
我的家庭真可爱
"Be it ever so

270
00:20:01,675 --> 00:20:05,771
整洁美满又安康
"Heinous

271
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:05,834
"There's no place like home"

272
00:20:10,651 --> 00:20:13,085
一楼，厕所
First floor, factory rejects.

273
00:20:14,355 --> 00:20:16,653
那些镇民神经可真粗
Those Whos are hard to frazzle, Max!

274
00:20:16,724 --> 00:20:19,989
反正我们已经尽力了
But we did our worst. And that's all that matters.

275
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:23,496
至少那个小女孩被我吓得半死
At least I scared the bejeebles out of that little girl at the post office.

276
00:20:23,564 --> 00:20:25,794
搞不好需要收惊
She'll be scarred for life, if we're lucky.

277
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:45,248
她居然没去告密
Funny she didn't rat on us, though.

278
00:20:45,319 --> 00:20:47,514
八成怕我报复
Must be afraid of reprisals.

279
00:20:59,166 --> 00:21:03,330
耶！小了一号半
Yes!

280
00:21:01,139 --> 00:21:03,349
Down a size and a half!

281
00:21:04,672 --> 00:21:07,505
这次我要保持下去
And this time, I'll keep it off.

282
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:11,607
麦斯，去捡回来
Get the stick, Max. Get the stick!

283
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:18,081
捡得到才怪
There's no stick!

284
00:21:18,152 --> 00:21:20,086
真好骗
I'm smarter.

285
00:21:26,193 --> 00:21:27,125
有留言吗？
Any calls?

286
00:21:29,630 --> 00:21:31,564
无人留言
<i>You have no messages.</i>

287
00:21:32,399 --> 00:21:35,197
怪了，难道没录音
Odd. Better check the outgoing.

288
00:21:37,071 --> 00:21:39,403
你最好没打错
<i>If you utter so much as one syllable...</i>

289
00:21:39,473 --> 00:21:43,705
否则你就倒大霉了
<i>...I'll hunt you down and gut you like a fish!</i>

290
00:21:43,777 --> 00:21:46,041
传真的话，请按米字键
<i>If you'd like to fax me, press the star key.</i>

291
00:21:48,816 --> 00:21:51,148
好吧
Oh, well.

292
00:21:55,656 --> 00:21:57,851
舒服多了
That's more like it.

293
00:22:17,878 --> 00:22:19,436
愉快的一年
Excellent year.

294
00:22:20,481 --> 00:22:24,679
告诉你，麦斯 我根本不需要出门
I'll tell you, Max...

295
00:22:22,386 --> 00:22:24,763
...I don't know why I ever leave this place.

296
00:22:24,752 --> 00:22:28,984
我在家有聊的很
I've got all the company I need right here.

297
00:22:30,124 --> 00:22:31,318
喂
Hello!

298
00:22:31,853 --> 00:22:33,355
<i>Hello!</i>

299
00:22:33,861 --> 00:22:34,793
你好吗？
How are you?

300
00:22:36,997 --> 00:22:38,259
是我先问的
<i>How are you?</i>

301
00:22:37,359 --> 00:22:38,944
I asked you first.

302
00:22:40,334 --> 00:22:44,828
学我讲话 你以为你很幽默吗？
<i>I asked you first.</i>

303
00:22:40,696 --> 00:22:44,783
That's really mature, saying exactly what I say!

304
00:22:45,158 --> 00:22:48,537
<i>Mature... exactly... what I say...</i>

305
00:22:49,977 --> 00:22:52,502
我是白痴 你是白痴
I'm an idiot!

306
00:22:51,706 --> 00:22:53,625
<i>You're an idiot!</i>

307
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:59,218
算你厉害，我不跟你讲话
All right, fine.

308
00:22:59,319 --> 00:23:01,549
我自己跟自己讲
I'm not talking to you anymore. In fact, I'm going to whisper.

309
00:23:01,622 --> 00:23:04,216
就算我的声音撞到墙
So that by the time my voice reverberates off the walls and gets back to me...

310
00:23:04,291 --> 00:23:06,225
再弹回来

311
00:23:06,293 --> 00:23:09,160
我也听不到
...I won't be able to hear it!

312
00:23:10,197 --> 00:23:12,688
你是白痴
<i>You're an idiot!</i>

313
00:23:24,344 --> 00:23:27,177
我不是在借吃浇愁吧？
Am I just eating because I'm bored?

314
00:23:36,890 --> 00:23:38,414
会是谁呢？
Who could that be?

315
00:23:40,327 --> 00:23:43,455
小妹妹 你是来念书给我们听的？
Hello, little girl. Are you here to read to us?

316
00:23:43,530 --> 00:23:47,398
不是，听说你们认识鬼灵精
No.

317
00:23:45,176 --> 00:23:48,221
I hear you know some things about the Grinch.

318
00:23:47,468 --> 00:23:49,197
“鬼灵精在胡谷镇附近出没”
<i>Cindy Lou had some questions in her curious heart.</i>

319
00:23:49,236 --> 00:23:52,364
辛蒂心中充满了疑问

320
00:23:52,439 --> 00:23:56,205
鬼灵精为什么会讨厌圣诞节
<i>Why did the Grinch hate Christmas? Where did it all start?</i>

321
00:23:56,276 --> 00:23:59,177
有了录音机，她就不怕了
<i>With her dad's blabbacorder she wouldn't give an inch.</i>

322
00:23:59,246 --> 00:24:04,047
请详细叙述你和鬼灵精 认识的经过
In your own words, please tell me everything you know about the Grinch.

323
00:24:04,151 --> 00:24:07,780
他从哪来的？ 是这样的
Where did he come from?

324
00:24:07,855 --> 00:24:10,016
他和其他胡谷宝宝一样
He came the way all Who babies come.

325
00:24:11,625 --> 00:24:15,288
在一个月黑风高的夜晚
<i>On calm nights...</i>

326
00:24:15,362 --> 00:24:17,990
胡谷镇的宝宝们
<i>...baby Who girls and tiny Who fellas...</i>

327
00:24:18,065 --> 00:24:22,229
坐着雨伞摇篮，从天而降
<i>...drift from the sky in their own pumbersellas.</i>

328
00:24:30,677 --> 00:24:33,669
老婆，我们的宝宝来了
Hey, honey, our baby is here!

329
00:24:35,849 --> 00:24:38,477
怎么长得像你老板
He looks just like your boss.

330
00:24:39,987 --> 00:24:42,581
原来如此
So that's how it works.

331
00:24:43,290 --> 00:24:47,659
那天是平安夜，窗外吹着怪风
It was Christmas Eve, and a strange wind blew that night.

332
00:25:14,788 --> 00:25:17,279
我们正在开圣诞舞会
<i>We were having our annual holiday get-together.</i>

333
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:44,579
到了早上才发现他在外面
<i>It was morning before anybody realized that he was out there!</i>

334
00:25:44,651 --> 00:25:45,913
可怜的宝宝
<i>The poor dear!</i>

335
00:25:46,587 --> 00:25:47,986
你知道吗？
But, you know what?

336
00:25:48,055 --> 00:25:50,023
我们马上就晓得他与众不同
We knew right away that he was special.

337
00:25:55,896 --> 00:25:58,330
要不要圣诞饼干？
Do you want a Christmas cookie?

338
00:25:58,398 --> 00:26:01,561
你想要哪一块？ 圣诞老人
Yes, which Christmas cookie would you like?

339
00:26:01,353 --> 00:26:02,395
Santa.

340
00:26:03,904 --> 00:26:05,166
他说话了
His first words!

341
00:26:05,205 --> 00:26:07,400
对，碟子上是圣诞老人
Yes, that is a Santa plate.

342
00:26:07,474 --> 00:26:10,068
你要不要拿啊？
Do you want to hold this Santa plate?

343
00:26:17,784 --> 00:26:19,513
圣诞老人，再见
Santa, bye-bye!

344
00:26:22,889 --> 00:26:26,620
他是个乖宝…

345
00:26:24,459 --> 00:26:26,544
<i>He was a wonderful...</i>

346
00:26:26,693 --> 00:26:28,718
…怪宝宝
<i>...whatever he was.</i>

347
00:26:28,795 --> 00:26:32,356
我们和胡谷镇其他的父母一样
<i>And we raised him like any other Who child:</i>

348
00:26:32,432 --> 00:26:34,559
教小孩要喜欢圣诞节
<i>With a deep love of Christmas.</i>

349
00:26:38,171 --> 00:26:41,140
记得，明天要交换圣诞礼物
Don't forget, tomorrow is our big Christmas gift exchange.

350
00:26:41,208 --> 00:26:46,373
每个人准备一份特别的礼物送人
Everyone bring a special gift for a special someone.

351
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:50,416
鬼灵精？
The...

352
00:26:48,024 --> 00:26:49,609
...Grinch...

353
00:26:50,517 --> 00:26:53,975
他对配色毫无概念
He had no sense of color coordination.

354
00:26:54,087 --> 00:26:57,784
我不太记得他，念书都来不及了
Although I hardly remember him. I didn't have time to socialize.

355
00:26:57,858 --> 00:27:02,955
哪有时间交朋友
<i>I was far too busy with my...</i>

356
00:27:01,371 --> 00:27:02,497
<i>...studies.</i>

357
00:27:03,030 --> 00:27:06,090
各位同学，写完了没
Now, class, is everyone almost finished?

358
00:27:07,834 --> 00:27:11,201
大家都说，他喜欢玛莎
<i>And if the truth be told, he...</i>

359
00:27:10,129 --> 00:27:11,214
He liked Martha.

360
00:27:12,606 --> 00:27:15,200
玛莎是我的女朋友
<i>Martha was my girlfriend.</i>

361
00:27:17,244 --> 00:27:19,144
我不想谈鬼灵精的事
I don't like discussing this Grinch so very close to Christmas, but...

362
00:27:19,212 --> 00:27:21,942
快过圣诞节了

363
00:27:22,049 --> 00:27:24,813
我想你也听说了…
...maybe if you hear the truth, you'll understand why--

364
00:27:25,018 --> 00:27:27,145
你没吃饭啊
Put your back into it!

365
00:27:27,187 --> 00:27:30,452
一直是我在罩他
I tried to take him under my wing.

366
00:27:31,158 --> 00:27:35,288
她不会喜欢你的，你脸上都是毛
You don't have a chance with her. You're 8 years old and you have a beard!

367
00:27:38,832 --> 00:27:41,232
他长了一身毛
He had hair. Not pleasant.

368
00:27:42,969 --> 00:27:45,938
而且还到处掉
He shed.

369
00:27:44,997 --> 00:27:46,040
Not right.

370
00:27:48,575 --> 00:27:51,806
知道吗？我最喜欢圣诞节了
You know, Christmas is my favorite time of year.

371
00:27:51,912 --> 00:27:54,142
尤其是那些颜色
I just love the colors.

372
00:27:54,748 --> 00:27:57,945
红色，还有绿色
The red...

373
00:27:56,467 --> 00:27:58,219
...and the green.

374
00:28:01,388 --> 00:28:04,152
我是不是暗恋鬼灵精？
<i>Did I have a crush on the Grinch?</i>

375
00:28:04,958 --> 00:28:06,152
当然不是
Of course not.

376
00:28:06,193 --> 00:28:07,990
那不是我问的
I didn't ask you that.

377
00:28:10,530 --> 00:28:11,861
是嘛
Right.

378
00:28:13,066 --> 00:28:15,296
他那天回家不知道怎么搞的
<i>For some reason, when he came home that day...</i>

379
00:28:15,402 --> 00:28:18,701
非常认真地在准备圣诞礼物
<i>...he really got into the Christmas spirit for the first time.</i>

380
00:28:19,773 --> 00:28:20,705
太好了
Perfect!

381
00:28:24,411 --> 00:28:25,537
Whoopsie!

382
00:28:32,152 --> 00:28:34,518
好漂亮的传家之宝
What a lovely family heirloom!

383
00:28:46,566 --> 00:28:48,500
爱的火焰
The fires of love!

384
00:28:50,971 --> 00:28:53,371
放在她的圣诞树上刚刚好
This will be perfect on the top of her tree.

385
00:28:53,473 --> 00:28:55,168
我爱玛莎
Oh, Martha! Oh, Christmas!

386
00:28:55,242 --> 00:28:56,709
我爱圣诞节

387
00:29:02,816 --> 00:29:05,979
明天要漂漂亮亮的来上学
<i>I want you all to look your best tomorrow.</i>

388
00:29:07,087 --> 00:29:09,021
她不会喜欢你的
<i>You don't have a chance with her.</i>

389
00:29:09,089 --> 00:29:11,853
你脸上都是毛
<i>You're 8 years old and you have a beard!</i>

390
00:29:27,674 --> 00:29:29,301
礼物都送好了吗？
Has everyone given their gifts?

391
00:29:30,377 --> 00:29:32,368
我还没 什么？
- I haven't. - What?

392
00:29:39,352 --> 00:29:42,321
玛莎，圣诞快乐
Merry Christmas, Martha May.

393
00:29:43,056 --> 00:29:45,251
你头上戴个袋子干嘛？
Why do you have a bag on your head?

394
00:29:46,092 --> 00:29:49,721
八成礼物太烂，没脸见人
Probably because he's embarrassed by that hideodorous gift.

395
00:29:51,364 --> 00:29:53,855
鬼灵精同学
Mr. Grinch...

396
00:29:53,934 --> 00:29:55,868
请你把袋子拿掉
...please take the bag off.

397
00:29:57,003 --> 00:30:00,234
对，把它脱掉
Yes, you.

398
00:29:58,546 --> 00:29:59,714
Take it off.

399
00:30:04,277 --> 00:30:06,336
把课本放下
Put the book down.

400
00:30:10,717 --> 00:30:11,979
还有你的脚
And your foot.

401
00:30:15,188 --> 00:30:17,156
你们看他的脸
Look at that hack job!

402
00:30:28,635 --> 00:30:30,660
臭礼物
Stupid present!

403
00:30:31,571 --> 00:30:33,300
臭树
Stupid tree!

404
00:30:33,373 --> 00:30:36,137
我讨厌圣诞节
I hate Christmas!

405
00:30:36,176 --> 00:30:38,406
那股怒气 那阵怒吼
- The anger. - The fury!

406
00:30:38,545 --> 00:30:40,672
那身肌肉
The muscles!

407
00:30:52,192 --> 00:30:57,459
他们实在太坏了，那样嘲笑他
It was a horrible day when they were so cruel to him.

408
00:30:57,564 --> 00:31:00,158
我…
And...

409
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,827
看了都好难过
...I could hardly bear it.

410
00:31:18,251 --> 00:31:22,187
我讨厌圣诞节，我讨厌它
I hate Christmas! I hate it!

411
00:31:22,255 --> 00:31:25,053
那是我们最后一次看到他
<i>And that was the last time we ever saw him.</i>

412
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:30,127
最后一次
<i>The very last time.</i>

413
00:32:21,247 --> 00:32:25,308
不管是因为他的心胸 还是他的鞋子
<i>So, whatever the reason, his heart or his shoes...</i>

414
00:32:25,418 --> 00:32:30,481
他站在山顶，继续讨厌胡谷镇民
<i>...he stood outside his cave...</i>

415
00:32:28,111 --> 00:32:30,155
<i>...hating the Whos.</i>

416
00:32:30,557 --> 00:32:32,491
照名字顺序
Alphabetically.

417
00:32:34,461 --> 00:32:36,929
艾瓦金胡
Aardvarkian Abakenezer Who...

418
00:32:36,997 --> 00:32:38,328
我…
...I...

419
00:32:38,398 --> 00:32:40,559
讨厌你
...hate you!

420
00:32:45,372 --> 00:32:48,773
艾伦班森胡，我讨厌你
Aaron B. Benson Who, I hate you.

421
00:32:48,842 --> 00:32:51,310
讨厌、讨厌、讨厌
Hate, hate, hate. Hate, hate, hate.

422
00:32:51,378 --> 00:32:53,471
非常讨厌
Double hate.

423
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:57,038
全部都讨厌
Loathe entirely!

424
00:33:03,490 --> 00:33:06,357
胡桃钳？
Nutcrackers?

425
00:33:06,426 --> 00:33:09,259
又是他们的庆祝活动
It's their Whobilation.

426
00:33:09,329 --> 00:33:12,594
他突然想到…
<i>He snarled with a sneer.</i>

427
00:33:12,699 --> 00:33:14,599
明天就是圣诞节
Tomorrow is Christmas! It's practically here.

428
00:33:14,701 --> 00:33:17,261
圣诞节到了

429
00:33:17,937 --> 00:33:23,239
麦斯，把镇静剂拿来
Max!

430
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:22,498
Fetch me my sedative.

431
00:33:23,343 --> 00:33:26,835
睡着了就不会胡思乱想
Now to take care of those pesky memories.

432
00:33:29,315 --> 00:33:31,875
圣诞庆祝活动多，有吃又有玩
"Whobilation, plentiful with candy canes and pies

433
00:33:31,985 --> 00:33:35,079
胡谷镇民聚一堂，开心过圣诞
"I can't wait to get there to eat some google fries

434
00:33:35,155 --> 00:33:36,952
胡谷镇，胡谷镇
"Whobilation, Whobilation"

435
00:33:38,024 --> 00:33:40,322
这次的庆祝我想过了 怎样？
- Dad? - Yeah.

436
00:33:38,598 --> 00:33:42,685
I've been thinking about the Whobilation and I may do something drastic.

437
00:33:40,393 --> 00:33:42,327
我可能会吓你们一跳

438
00:33:42,395 --> 00:33:44,454
我没意见，你问你妈
That's fine, dear. Ask your mother.

439
00:33:44,531 --> 00:33:47,295
她去哪了？ 老公
- Where did she go? - Honey!

440
00:33:47,367 --> 00:33:49,995
老公，等我
Honey! Hi!

441
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:54,234
你看，可以拿来当圣诞灯饰
Look, I just found the cutest light for my Christmas display.

442
00:33:55,375 --> 00:33:58,071
快点，我们要迟到了
Hurry up, we're gonna be late. Come on.

443
00:34:16,596 --> 00:34:18,860
现在宣布
And now, the nominations...

444
00:34:18,932 --> 00:34:21,924
胡谷镇民票选
...for that Who among us who best typifies...

445
00:34:22,001 --> 00:34:25,402
担任圣诞男女主角
...the qualities of Whodom and Whodery...

446
00:34:25,472 --> 00:34:29,340
最合适的人选
...the Whoville holiday cheermeister!

447
00:34:38,084 --> 00:34:40,678
有人要提名吗？
Do I hear a nomination?

448
00:34:40,787 --> 00:34:42,186
我提名鬼灵精
I nominate the Grinch!

449
00:34:44,496 --> 00:34:47,374
- The Grinch? - The Grinch?

450
00:34:49,329 --> 00:34:51,194
天哪
My, my, my.

451
00:34:51,264 --> 00:34:54,961
阿卢，你女儿可真幽默
What an altruistic daughter you have there, Lou!

452
00:34:55,802 --> 00:34:56,700
不客气
Thank you.

453
00:34:59,136 --> 00:35:00,387
Cindy?

454
00:35:02,742 --> 00:35:05,677
“胡谷镇民手册”
Let me quote a verse...

455
00:35:05,812 --> 00:35:08,110
上面说过…
<i>...from The Book of Who.</i>

456
00:35:08,181 --> 00:35:10,149
谢谢
Thank you.

457
00:35:10,183 --> 00:35:12,151
“鬼灵精”三个字
"The term 'Grinchy' shall apply when Christmas spirit is in short supply."

458
00:35:12,185 --> 00:35:15,416
代表欠缺圣诞精神

459
00:35:15,488 --> 00:35:18,821
你还认为他适合担任吗？
Now, I ask you: Does that sound like our holiday cheermeister?

460
00:35:18,892 --> 00:35:23,056
但是，镇长先生 镇民手册上面也说
<i>True, Mr. May-Who. But The Book of Who says this too:</i>

461
00:35:23,663 --> 00:35:25,961
不论镇民长相如何
"No matter how different a Who may appear...

462
00:35:26,032 --> 00:35:29,195
皆受到圣诞的欢迎
"...he will always be welcomed with holiday cheer."

463
00:35:31,337 --> 00:35:35,171
是没错，可是上面还说…
Yes, the book also says, the...

464
00:35:35,208 --> 00:35:36,732
鬼灵精
"The award...

465
00:35:36,843 --> 00:35:39,744
不得接受此项荣誉
"...cannot go to the Grinch, because...

466
00:35:39,879 --> 00:35:43,679
因为他一定会…搞砸
"...sometimes things get the lead-pipe cinch."

467
00:35:43,750 --> 00:35:46,048
你骗人，上面没这么说
You made that up! It doesn't say that.

468
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:48,652
当然有
No, it does.

469
00:35:49,522 --> 00:35:50,989
哪一页？
What page?

470
00:35:54,227 --> 00:35:57,856
我忘记了，反正…
Lost my place, but it's...

471
00:35:57,931 --> 00:36:00,900
上面说过 但是手册有说
It's in here!

472
00:35:59,153 --> 00:36:01,114
But the book does say:

473
00:36:00,967 --> 00:36:04,562
应该由最需要鼓励的人
"The cheermeister is the one who deserves a back slap or a toast.

474
00:36:04,637 --> 00:36:07,868
来担任圣诞男主角
"And it goes to the soul at Christmas who needs it most."

475
00:36:07,941 --> 00:36:11,138
我认为鬼灵精需要鼓励
And I believe that soul is the Grinch.

476
00:36:12,312 --> 00:36:14,940
我相信大家和我一样
And if you're the Whos I hope you are, you will too.

477
00:36:15,048 --> 00:36:16,640
都这么认为

478
00:36:17,417 --> 00:36:18,349
她说得对
She's right!

479
00:36:23,556 --> 00:36:25,751
随便你们
Fine.

480
00:36:25,825 --> 00:36:29,124
你们要浪费提名人选
You people want to waste a perfectly good nomination...

481
00:36:29,195 --> 00:36:31,129
是你们的事
...why, it's up to you.

482
00:36:31,197 --> 00:36:33,961
不过我告诉你们
But I am telling you...

483
00:36:34,033 --> 00:36:37,525
他死都不会下来的
...the Grinch will never come down.

484
00:36:37,604 --> 00:36:40,573
他缺席的话，就由镇长担任
And when he doesn't, the Mayor will wear the crown.

485
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:42,767
也只好如此了
Well, more or less.

486
00:36:43,823 --> 00:36:46,617
<i>"Deck your heart with jollity</i>

487
00:36:46,701 --> 00:36:49,328
<i>"Style your smile all Christmasy</i>

488
00:36:49,412 --> 00:36:52,123
<i>"Flick some flocking on the tree</i>

489
00:36:52,164 --> 00:36:54,667
<i>"Let there be Whobilation</i>

490
00:36:55,126 --> 00:36:57,920
<i>"Bake the fruitcake, egg the nog</i>

491
00:36:58,003 --> 00:37:00,714
<i>"Feed the flaming Wholtide log</i>

492
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:03,551
<i>"Baste the beast and gulp the grog</i>

493
00:37:03,634 --> 00:37:06,387
<i>"Let there be Whobilation</i>

494
00:37:06,165 --> 00:37:08,827
滴答，滴答
"Tick, tock, tick, tock

495
00:37:08,935 --> 00:37:11,802
圣诞时钟滴答响
"Counting down the Christmas clock

496
00:37:11,871 --> 00:37:14,465
男女老幼
"Old, young, big, small"

497
00:37:22,215 --> 00:37:25,742
讨厌的圣诞歌
Blast this Christmas music.

498
00:37:25,852 --> 00:37:28,821
难听得要命
It's joyful and triumphant.

499
00:37:28,955 --> 00:37:31,219
看谁够大声
Must drown them out!

500
00:37:40,633 --> 00:37:41,895
没有用
Not working!

501
00:37:43,803 --> 00:37:47,796
北风从胡谷镇上呼啸而过
<i>The whipperwinds whipped high above the Who town.</i>

502
00:37:47,874 --> 00:37:51,605
一不留神，人就会滑下山谷
<i>A trip or a slip you'd slide all the way down.</i>

503
00:37:51,678 --> 00:37:55,637
但是小女孩身负着一项使命
<i>But this girl had a mission. She knew what to do.</i>

504
00:37:55,715 --> 00:37:57,649
勇敢的辛蒂要上山
<i>She'd invite the Grinch herself, that brave Cindy Lou.</i>

505
00:37:57,717 --> 00:38:00,185
亲自邀请鬼灵精

506
00:38:08,227 --> 00:38:11,424
敲啊，猴子，用力敲
Play, monkey! Play!

507
00:38:20,506 --> 00:38:23,907
“滚开”

508
00:38:24,005 --> 00:38:25,841
Howdy?

509
00:38:28,881 --> 00:38:30,815
鬼灵精先生？
Mr. Grinch?

510
00:38:33,723 --> 00:38:35,600
Mr. Grinch!

511
00:38:40,355 --> 00:38:41,564
Hello?

512
00:39:07,553 --> 00:39:08,485
对不起
Excuse me.

513
00:39:24,737 --> 00:39:28,537
你好，小妹妹
Hello...

514
00:39:28,608 --> 00:39:34,205
你好大胆，闯进鬼灵精的窝
...little girl.

515
00:39:29,070 --> 00:39:31,656
How dare you enter...

516
00:39:31,906 --> 00:39:34,408
...the Grinch's lair?

517
00:39:34,313 --> 00:39:37,544
没礼貌、不要脸
The impudence! The audacity!

518
00:39:37,617 --> 00:39:40,313
实在是无法无天
The unmitigated gall!

519
00:39:40,386 --> 00:39:44,379
是你自找的，休怪我…
You called down the thunder...

520
00:39:42,667 --> 00:39:46,128
...now, get ready for the boom!

521
00:39:44,457 --> 00:39:46,448
手下无情

522
00:39:46,526 --> 00:39:50,895
看我这次，怎么吓你
Gaze into the face of fear!

523
00:39:53,199 --> 00:39:54,598
鬼灵精先生
Mr. Grinch...

524
00:39:55,168 --> 00:39:57,295
你好，我叫辛蒂卢
...my name is Cindy Lou Who.

525
00:39:57,370 --> 00:40:01,170
你看，现在怕了吧
You see?

526
00:39:58,849 --> 00:40:03,187
Even now the terror is welling up inside you.

527
00:40:01,207 --> 00:40:03,198
手脚发软了吧

528
00:40:04,377 --> 00:40:06,004
我没有害怕
I'm not scared.

529
00:40:06,145 --> 00:40:10,104
少来了，怕我是很正常的
Denial is to be expected in the face of pure evil.

530
00:40:12,518 --> 00:40:14,952
我真的不怕
I don't think so.

531
00:40:15,021 --> 00:40:19,720
否认？又来了一个神经大条的
Doubt?

532
00:40:16,450 --> 00:40:20,329
Another unmistakable sign of the heebie-jeebies!

533
00:40:20,793 --> 00:40:24,320
你这下完蛋了
Now you're doomed!

534
00:40:31,838 --> 00:40:33,965
你快点逃
Run for your life...

535
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:36,873
我要发作了
...before I kill again!

536
00:40:39,846 --> 00:40:40,744
我是疯子
I'm a psycho!

537
00:40:44,517 --> 00:40:46,508
危险，小心
Danger! Danger!

538
00:40:56,095 --> 00:40:58,689
也许你该休息一下
Maybe you need a time-out.

539
00:41:03,769 --> 00:41:08,797
现在的小孩，电视电影看太多了
Kids today.

540
00:41:05,374 --> 00:41:08,293
So desensitized by movies and television.

541
00:41:08,875 --> 00:41:10,308
你要干嘛？
What do you want?

542
00:41:11,611 --> 00:41:12,873
鬼先生
Mr. Grinch, I came to invite you...

543
00:41:13,212 --> 00:41:17,876
我来邀请你，担任圣诞男主角

544
00:41:15,550 --> 00:41:17,928
...to be holiday cheermeister.

545
00:41:20,319 --> 00:41:24,278
圣诞什么东东？ 男主角
- "Holiday Whobie-what-y"? - Cheermeister.

546
00:41:24,357 --> 00:41:26,325
男主角，与朋友共度佳节
"Cheermeister. Celebrate with friends."

547
00:41:30,796 --> 00:41:32,923
真好笑
That's a good one.

548
00:41:32,999 --> 00:41:35,229
我知道你讨厌圣诞节
I know you hate Christmas, but what if it's all just a misunderstanding?

549
00:41:35,301 --> 00:41:37,667
万一只是一场误会呢？

550
00:41:37,737 --> 00:41:41,798
无所谓 我自己也不相信圣诞节
- Don't care. - I myself am having some Yuletide doubts.

551
00:41:41,874 --> 00:41:44,274
如果你愿意来胡谷镇
But maybe if you reunite with the Whos and be a part of Christmas--

552
00:41:44,343 --> 00:41:46,277
一起庆祝圣诞节…
"Maybe if you reunite with the Whos and be a part of Christmas."

553
00:41:48,581 --> 00:41:51,709
别傻了 我也许就会相信了
Grow up!

554
00:41:49,793 --> 00:41:51,836
Then maybe it'll be all right for me, too!

555
00:41:51,817 --> 00:41:55,344
抱歉，谈话时间结束 预约下次咨询
I'm sorry, your session is over.

556
00:41:53,505 --> 00:41:56,674
Please make another appointment with the receptionist on the way out.

557
00:41:55,421 --> 00:41:58,982
请找接待小狗 你一定要接受这个奖
Please, please. You have to accept the award.

558
00:42:04,397 --> 00:42:06,331
什么奖？
Award?

559
00:42:08,501 --> 00:42:10,435
你怎么不早说
You never mentioned an award!

560
00:42:10,503 --> 00:42:12,437
有奖品

561
00:42:12,505 --> 00:42:14,564
有啊，有奖杯跟其他的东西
Yeah, with a trophy and everything.

562
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:16,574
我赢了？ 你赢了
- And I won? - You won!

563
00:42:17,643 --> 00:42:20,134
那表示有人输了 大概吧
- That means there were losers. - I guess.

564
00:42:20,279 --> 00:42:25,012
你来的话… 全镇都输了
- So, if you come-- - A town full of losers!

565
00:42:25,084 --> 00:42:27,416
我喜欢
I like it.

566
00:42:27,486 --> 00:42:30,649
有人受不了打击吗？
Was anyone emotionally shattered?

567
00:42:30,723 --> 00:42:34,352
说啊，你之前不是话很多 细节，说细节
Come on, a minute ago I couldn't shut you up! Details, details!

568
00:42:34,427 --> 00:42:36,793
嗯，镇长不太高兴
The Mayor wasn't happy.

569
00:42:39,133 --> 00:42:40,426
Oh, no.

570
00:42:40,766 --> 00:42:42,700
梅玛莎也会去
Martha May will be there.

571
00:42:44,303 --> 00:42:46,863
她也会去？
She will?

572
00:42:46,939 --> 00:42:49,965
那她就会看到我，赢
And she'll see me.

573
00:42:49,518 --> 00:42:50,603
A winner.

574
00:42:51,477 --> 00:42:53,570
她会像苍蝇一样
She'll be on me like fleegle flies on a flat-faced floogle horse.

575
00:42:53,679 --> 00:42:55,738
绕着我打转

576
00:42:55,848 --> 00:42:58,408
玛莎，我不想让你难过
I'm sorry to disappoint you, Martha, baby, but the G train has left the station.

577
00:42:58,517 --> 00:43:00,485
但是我们之间不可能了

578
00:43:00,586 --> 00:43:01,746
你会来吗？
So, will you come?

579
00:43:03,422 --> 00:43:04,354
好吧
All right.

580
00:43:05,591 --> 00:43:07,991
不晓得是你可爱的眼睛
I don't know if it's that adorable twinkle in your eye...

581
00:43:08,060 --> 00:43:13,362
还是你坚强的意志 让我想到当年的我
...or that nonconformist streak...

582
00:43:10,372 --> 00:43:13,959
...that reminds me of a younger, less hairy me.

583
00:43:14,066 --> 00:43:15,397
我被你打动了
But you've convinced me.

584
00:43:16,168 --> 00:43:18,136
说不定，这次的圣诞庆祝
Who knows? This Whobilation could change my entire outlook on life!

585
00:43:18,204 --> 00:43:21,401
会改变我的一生

586
00:43:21,474 --> 00:43:23,533
真的？  才怪
- Really? - No.

587
00:43:57,610 --> 00:44:02,172
终于找到你了，等下再堆雪人
There you are, honey.

588
00:44:00,005 --> 00:44:02,216
You can make snow angels later.

589
00:44:02,281 --> 00:44:05,216
圣诞庆祝就要开始了
We can't be late for the Whobilation!

590
00:44:08,187 --> 00:44:11,088
那群镇民也真是的
The nerve of those Whos.

591
00:44:11,157 --> 00:44:13,148
现在才通知我
Inviting me down there on such short notice.

592
00:44:13,225 --> 00:44:17,161
就算我想去，也排不出时间来
Even if I wanted to go, my schedule wouldn't allow it.

593
00:44:19,165 --> 00:44:21,929
四点，自怜
"4:00, wallow in self-pity.

594
00:44:22,001 --> 00:44:25,493
四点半，发呆
"4:30, stare into the abyss.

595
00:44:25,571 --> 00:44:27,505
五点，饥饿三十
"5:00, solve world hunger...

596
00:44:27,573 --> 00:44:30,007
默默行善
"...tell no one.

597
00:44:30,076 --> 00:44:32,010
五点半，鬼扯
"5:30, jazzercise.

598
00:44:32,078 --> 00:44:35,241
六点半，独自晚餐，不能失约
"6:30, dinner with me." I can't cancel that again.

599
00:44:35,381 --> 00:44:38,282
七点，自怨
"7:00, wrestle with my self-loathing."

600
00:44:39,151 --> 00:44:40,675
都排满了
I'm booked.

601
00:44:40,786 --> 00:44:43,016
如果把自怨的时间挪到九点
If I bumped the loathing to 9:00, I'd have time to lay in bed...

602
00:44:43,089 --> 00:44:48,117
我还是可以准时上床，继续失眠
...stare at the ceiling and slip slowly into madness.

603
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:50,526
可是要穿什么呢？
But what would I wear?

604
00:45:09,982 --> 00:45:12,849
这不是洋装，是苏格兰裙
It's not a dress, it's a kilt!

605
00:45:13,986 --> 00:45:15,419
变态
Sicko!

606
00:45:17,323 --> 00:45:21,555
太逊、太丑、太土了
Stupid.

607
00:45:18,958 --> 00:45:20,001
Ugly.

608
00:45:20,084 --> 00:45:21,544
Out of date.

609
00:45:23,062 --> 00:45:26,361
什么嘛，要是没有合适的衣服
This is ridiculous.

610
00:45:24,756 --> 00:45:28,259
If I can't find something nice to wear, I'm not going!

611
00:45:26,465 --> 00:45:28,365
我就不去

612
00:45:46,318 --> 00:45:48,252
决定了，我不去
That's it, I'm not going.

613
00:46:00,332 --> 00:46:05,235
到了颁奖给圣诞男主角的时间了
<i>It's time for our Holiday Cheermeister of the Year Award!</i>

614
00:46:11,210 --> 00:46:14,702
恭喜，鬼灵精先生
<i>Congratulations, Mr. Grinch!</i>

615
00:46:14,814 --> 00:46:17,180
“胡谷镇军乐队”

616
00:46:17,249 --> 00:46:18,648
他没来
<i>He isn't here.</i>

617
00:46:19,251 --> 00:46:20,946
什么？
<i>What?</i>

618
00:46:21,020 --> 00:46:23,147
他竟然没来？
<i>He didn't show?</i>

619
00:46:24,757 --> 00:46:26,725
谁会想到呢？
<i>Who could have predicted this?</i>

620
00:46:27,927 --> 00:46:30,657
好，我就去一下
All right. I'll swing by for a minute, allow them to envy me...

621
00:46:30,729 --> 00:46:34,221
让他们恭喜我 吃点点心，然后闪人
...grab a handful of popcorn shrimp, and blow out of there.

622
00:46:35,267 --> 00:46:37,497
万一被骗怎么办？
But what if it's a cruel prank? What if it's a cash bar?

623
00:46:37,570 --> 00:46:39,731
万一要钱怎么办？

624
00:46:39,805 --> 00:46:43,741
赚我的钱？还是去好了
How dare they?

625
00:46:43,809 --> 00:46:47,768
但是要迟到一下，去，不去
All right, I'll go.

626
00:46:44,043 --> 00:46:45,544
But I'll be fashionably late.

627
00:46:45,711 --> 00:46:47,963
No. Yes. No. Yes. No!

628
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:49,279
去
Yes!

629
00:46:50,683 --> 00:46:52,947
死都不去
Definitely not!

630
00:46:53,018 --> 00:46:55,418
好吧，决定了
All right. I've made my decision!

631
00:46:55,521 --> 00:46:57,887
我去，就这么办
I'm going, and that's that.

632
00:46:59,425 --> 00:47:00,892
如果来得及
Had my fingers crossed.

633
00:47:04,463 --> 00:47:07,364
也许我该丢铜板
Maybe I should flip a coin!

634
00:47:14,907 --> 00:47:19,640
看来，只好由第二名替补
<i>I guess the award goes to...</i>

635
00:47:18,660 --> 00:47:19,995
<i>...the runner-up.</i>

636
00:47:21,647 --> 00:47:25,777
没错，一位圣诞精神的代表
<i>That's right. A man for whom Christmas comes not once a year...</i>

637
00:47:25,885 --> 00:47:28,046
圣诞精神的化身
<i>...but every minute of every day.</i>

638
00:47:28,120 --> 00:47:31,487
一位潇洒、正直的男士
<i>A handsome, noble man.</i>

639
00:47:31,590 --> 00:47:34,150
一位割了两次扁桃腺的人
<i>A man who has had his tonsils removed twice!</i>

640
00:47:35,261 --> 00:47:36,956
这说来话长
<i>That's an interesting story.</i>

641
00:47:37,029 --> 00:47:40,089
事情是这样…
<i>You see, what happened was--</i>

642
00:47:54,380 --> 00:47:56,746
你好，玛莎 他赶来了
Hello, Martha.

643
00:47:56,815 --> 00:47:58,806
辛蒂 女儿
He made it!

644
00:47:57,282 --> 00:47:58,408
- Cindy. - Honey!

645
00:48:22,432 --> 00:48:23,474
Look--

646
00:48:25,945 --> 00:48:27,879
好热闹，好热闹
Hot crowd. Hot crowd.

647
00:48:29,915 --> 00:48:33,407
我是来…
I believe I'm here to...

648
00:48:33,519 --> 00:48:37,717
领个什么奖的
...accept an award of some kind.

649
00:48:37,790 --> 00:48:41,248
还有，那个小妹妹
And the child mentioned a check.

650
00:48:41,327 --> 00:48:42,885
说过有奖金

651
00:48:42,962 --> 00:48:45,760
我哪有说过 随便啦，快颁奖
- No, I didn't. - All right, then, give me the award.

652
00:48:45,831 --> 00:48:47,765
快点，想等死我啊
Come on, while I'm young!

653
00:48:47,833 --> 00:48:50,700
别担心，圣诞男主角
<i>Don't you worry, Mr. Holiday Cheermeister, you'll get your award.</i>

654
00:48:50,769 --> 00:48:52,532
一定会颁奖给你

655
00:48:52,638 --> 00:48:57,575
但首先，应该全家团聚
<i>But first, a little family reunion.</i>

656
00:48:57,676 --> 00:48:58,574
供你吃
<i>They nursed you. They clothed you.</i>

657
00:48:59,445 --> 00:49:01,879
供你穿的是她们

658
00:49:01,981 --> 00:49:06,008
你的老妈子
<i>Here they are...</i>

659
00:49:02,722 --> 00:49:05,558
<i>...your old biddies!</i>

660
00:49:07,119 --> 00:49:09,952
你们还没死？
Are you two still living?

661
00:49:10,022 --> 00:49:11,580
我们想死你了
We missed you!

662
00:49:12,758 --> 00:49:15,249
罗丝，毛衣，毛衣
Rose. The sweater. The sweater, Rose.

663
00:49:15,327 --> 00:49:17,989
毛衣？什么意思？我不要
Sweater? What are you talkin' about? No, I can't!

664
00:49:18,063 --> 00:49:20,531
不要逼我
I can't do that!

665
00:49:22,034 --> 00:49:23,194
不要乱摸
Don't touch me there!

666
00:49:31,510 --> 00:49:33,808
圣诞宝座来啦
Put him in the Chair of Cheer!

667
00:49:33,912 --> 00:49:35,072
圣诞宝座？
Chair of Cheer?

668
00:49:35,147 --> 00:49:38,139
什么是圣诞宝座？
What's the Chair of Cheer?

669
00:49:38,183 --> 00:49:42,279
你提都没提过 拜托，不要生气
You didn't tell me about the Chair of Cheer.

670
00:49:40,050 --> 00:49:42,469
Please, Mr. Grinch.

671
00:49:44,156 --> 00:49:46,954
我真的不行 我还没做好心理准备
No. I can't do it, honestly.

672
00:49:45,306 --> 00:49:47,141
I'm not ready. It's too much, too soon!

673
00:49:47,026 --> 00:49:48,425
圣诞男主角
<i>It's that time of year.</i>

674
00:49:48,494 --> 00:49:51,258
现在坐上宝座接受欢呼
<i>The Cheermeister's ride in the Chair of Cheer!</i>

675
00:49:52,164 --> 00:49:55,861
放我下来，不然我告你们
Put me down! I mean it!

676
00:49:55,934 --> 00:49:58,926
你们要倒大霉了
I've got a lawyer.

677
00:49:56,316 --> 00:49:58,318
There'll be hell to pay!

678
00:49:59,004 --> 00:50:02,496
首先，你要担任评审
<i>First, you'll put your taste buds to the test...</i>

679
00:50:02,574 --> 00:50:07,443
选出布丁比赛的冠军 布丁比赛的冠军
<i>...as you judge the Who pudding cook-off!</i>

680
00:50:07,546 --> 00:50:09,639
先试我的 我吃不出来…
- Mine first. - I really don't know--

681
00:50:09,782 --> 00:50:11,875
不，我的比较好
No, mine's the best!

682
00:50:11,984 --> 00:50:13,076
你会喜欢的
You'll enjoy this!

683
00:50:14,653 --> 00:50:17,349
这不是布丁
This is not pudding.

684
00:50:17,423 --> 00:50:18,822
那是什么？
What is it?

685
00:50:20,392 --> 00:50:23,054
这是我做的
This is mine. Yummy, yummy, yummy.

686
00:50:23,128 --> 00:50:25,221
圣诞康加舞
Christmas conga!

687
00:50:25,297 --> 00:50:28,232
这么晚，我该回去了
Look at the time. I really should be getting back.

688
00:50:28,300 --> 00:50:29,460
跳就跳
All right!

689
00:50:34,907 --> 00:50:36,898
水果蛋糕
Fruitcake, tra-la-la!

690
00:50:38,024 --> 00:50:39,192
No.

691

软糖比赛
Fudge Judge.

692
00:50:48,954 --> 00:50:50,546
我自己做的 是吗？
Made it myself.

693
00:50:50,622 --> 00:50:54,615
我的也是 好
Yeah? Mine are homemade too.

694
00:50:52,998 --> 00:50:54,207
Okay.

695
00:50:54,693 --> 00:50:57,218
来啊，继续塞
Put it in. Bring it on!

696
00:50:57,296 --> 00:50:59,230
没有了吗？
Is that all you got?

697
00:50:59,298 --> 00:51:01,198
没有了吗？来啊
Is that all you got? Come on.

698
00:51:07,072 --> 00:51:09,006
笨蛋，别挡路
Out of the way, slow-mo!

699
00:51:10,275 --> 00:51:13,642
对不起，借过
Excuse me.

700
00:51:24,556 --> 00:51:26,990
他是跳跳袋比赛第一名
He's number one in the sack race run!

701
00:51:27,059 --> 00:51:30,256
第一名，我是第一名
Number one! I'm number one!

702
00:51:30,329 --> 00:51:32,422
我是第一名

704
00:51:36,268 --> 00:51:37,200

705
00:51:41,306 --> 00:51:43,274
我赢了
I beat you.

706
00:51:51,556 --> 00:51:52,890
He won!

707
00:51:54,019 --> 00:51:57,887
终于到了大家期待已久的时刻
<i>And now it's time for the moment we've all been waiting for.</i>

708
00:51:57,956 --> 00:51:59,947
对，我的奖品
<i>Yes! My award.</i>

709
00:52:00,859 --> 00:52:02,224
还有奖金 没有奖金
<i>- Write the check. - There's no check.</i>

710
00:52:02,294 --> 00:52:06,196
你确定？ 我记得别人告诉我有奖金
<i>Are you sure? Because I thought I heard someone mention a check.</i>

711
00:52:06,265 --> 00:52:08,597
都说了，没有奖金
<i>I said, there's no check. And now it's time...</i>

712
00:52:08,667 --> 00:52:10,828
现在该发礼物了
<i>...for Present Pass-it-on!</i>

713
00:52:12,070 --> 00:52:14,538
按照惯例，从圣诞男主角开始

Yes, yes, yes. Good times!

717
00:52:56,782 --> 00:52:58,010
小时候
Good times.

718
00:52:59,084 --> 00:53:04,112
现在我要送份小礼物给我的最爱
And now, I have a little something for the love of my life.

719
00:53:04,461 --> 00:53:05,963
Martha May...

720
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:11,357
希望你能成为，奥古斯胡夫人
...please become Mrs. Augustus May-Who.

721
00:53:19,518 --> 00:53:21,019
Augustus...

722
00:53:21,473 --> 00:53:23,566
只要你嫁给我
If you agree to be my wife...

723
00:53:23,642 --> 00:53:26,270
不但一辈子吃穿不尽
...along with a lifetime supply of happiness, you'll also receive this:

724
00:53:26,345 --> 00:53:28,210
而且还会得到…

725
00:53:30,983 --> 00:53:34,180
一辆新车
<i>It's a new car!</i>

726
00:53:34,219 --> 00:53:38,019
由胡谷镇的纳税人热情提供
<i>Generously provided by the taxpayers of Whoville!</i>

727
00:53:39,691 --> 00:53:41,659
你意下如何？
<i>What do you say, Martha?</i>

728
00:53:42,227 --> 00:53:45,754
你有廿秒钟的时间
<i>You got 20 seconds on the clock.</i>

729
00:53:46,732 --> 00:53:49,724
这个，我…

730
00:53:48,755 --> 00:53:49,798
<i>I...</i>

731
00:53:53,138 --> 00:53:55,936
这些礼物非常吸引人
<i>These gifts are quite dazzling.</i>

732
00:54:05,951 --> 00:54:09,216
那还用说
Of course they are.

733
00:54:09,288 --> 00:54:11,188
这就是你们的目的？
That's what it's all about, isn't it?

734
00:54:11,256 --> 00:54:15,158
你们的目的就是为了这个
That's what it's always been about!

735
00:54:16,194 --> 00:54:17,752
礼物
Gifts!

736
00:54:17,909 --> 00:54:18,993
Gifts.

737
00:54:19,160 --> 00:54:21,579
Gifts, gifts, gifts.

738
00:54:22,267 --> 00:54:24,565
想知道那些礼物去哪了吗？
You want to know what happens to your gifts?

739
00:54:24,636 --> 00:54:27,833
都进了垃圾桶，到我家了
They all come to me. In your garbage.

740
00:54:27,906 --> 00:54:32,366
听到没？都进垃圾桶了
You see what I'm saying?

741
00:54:29,398 --> 00:54:31,358
In your garbage!

742
00:54:32,444 --> 00:54:38,246
光是在垃圾场找到的领结 就够我上吊了
I could hang myself with all the bad Christmas neckties I found at the dump!

743
00:54:38,317 --> 00:54:40,080
贪心
And the avarice.

744
00:54:41,787 --> 00:54:44,984
什么都想要
The avarice never ends!

745
00:54:45,057 --> 00:54:46,524
我要高尔夫球具，我要钻石
"I want golf clubs." "I want diamonds."

746
00:54:46,591 --> 00:54:51,051
我要一匹小马，不要再把它卖掉
"I want a pony, so I can ride it twice, get bored, and sell it to make glue."

747
00:54:51,129 --> 00:54:53,063
不是我要唱反调
Look, I don't want to make waves, but this whole Christmas season is...

748
00:54:53,131 --> 00:54:56,623
但是所谓的圣诞节

749
00:54:56,702 --> 00:54:59,535
实在是，烂透了
...stupid, stupid, stupid!

750
00:55:00,605 --> 00:55:02,470
虽然烂
There is, however...

751
00:55:02,541 --> 00:55:06,102
有一项小小的…
...one teeny-tiny...

752
00:55:06,178 --> 00:55:08,305
圣诞传统
...Christmas tradition...

753
00:55:08,413 --> 00:55:10,779
我觉得…
...I find...

754
00:55:10,849 --> 00:55:14,307
非常有意义
...quite meaningful.

755
00:55:18,557 --> 00:55:20,491
w寄生
Mistletoe.

756
00:55:20,559 --> 00:55:24,359
乡巴佬，排队来亲吧
Now, pucker up and kiss it, Whoville!

757
00:55:32,137 --> 00:55:34,935
有人剪头发了
Somebody's fabulous!

758
00:55:38,043 --> 00:55:41,342
好，轮你们，往那边走
All right, your turn! Go on!

759
00:55:48,453 --> 00:55:49,579
我们快走 不要
- Let's go! - No!

760
00:55:49,654 --> 00:55:54,250
对不起，老先生 不介意我喝一口吧
Excuse me, old-timer.

761
00:55:52,564 --> 00:55:54,399
Mind if I wet my whistle?

762
00:55:54,326 --> 00:55:56,419
我，嗯…

763
00:55:59,097 --> 00:56:00,394
那是我的好酒
That's my good stuff!

764
00:56:08,607 --> 00:56:11,599
烧吧，尽量烧
Burn, baby! Burn!

765
00:56:22,187 --> 00:56:23,779
好酷

766
00:56:23,855 --> 00:56:26,323
胡谷镇的传统
The Whomanity!

767
00:56:27,893 --> 00:56:29,326
我们快走 等一下
- Let's go! Come on! - No, wait!

768
00:56:29,394 --> 00:56:32,158
想想办法 是
- Do something. - Right!

769
00:56:39,538 --> 00:56:41,631
各单位注意，各单位注意
<i>Calling all units. Calling all units.</i>

770
00:56:45,577 --> 00:56:47,841
计程车
Taxi!

771
00:56:49,214 --> 00:56:51,774
因为我是绿色就不停？
It's because I'm green, isn't it?

772
00:56:56,421 --> 00:56:58,355
停
Halt!

773
00:56:59,458 --> 00:57:02,723
晚安，不介意我搭个便车吧
Evening, folks. Mind if I ride along?

774
00:57:02,794 --> 00:57:04,159
你们最好挪一挪
You might want to scooch over.

775
00:57:06,765 --> 00:57:08,699
算你们聪明
You did the right thing.

776
00:57:16,875 --> 00:57:18,968
让开
Out of the way!

777
00:57:28,220 --> 00:57:29,482
明天一定会屁股痛
That's gonna hurt in the morning.

778
00:57:54,813 --> 00:57:57,043
要爆炸了
It's gonna blow!

779
00:58:14,533 --> 00:58:18,196
你们没事吧？不如买顶帽子吧
You fellas all right?

780
00:58:16,083 --> 00:58:17,876
How about a nice hat?

781
00:58:18,335 --> 00:58:19,503
Lou?

782
00:58:28,647 --> 00:58:30,740
我很伤心，阿卢
I'm hurt, Lou.

783
00:58:30,849 --> 00:58:33,010
我并不是那么容易受伤的人
I'm hurt, and I don't hurt easily.

784
00:58:33,118 --> 00:58:36,576
但是你们一家人…
But you and your family...

785
00:58:37,589 --> 00:58:41,081
我实在…太失望了
I'm so...

786
00:58:39,106 --> 00:58:40,691
...disappointed.

787
00:58:42,527 --> 00:58:48,432
不如我们回到 原来的圣诞庆祝活动
Can we just get back to Christmas...

788
00:58:45,237 --> 00:58:47,614
...the way it should be?

789
00:58:48,500 --> 00:58:50,525
忘了鬼灵精
Grinch-less?

790
00:58:50,602 --> 00:58:53,867
圣诞快乐
Merry Christmas!

791
00:58:53,912 --> 00:58:56,248
Merry Christmas!

792
00:59:00,145 --> 00:59:04,138
我只是希望大家能一起过圣诞节
I just wanted everybody to be together for Christmas.

793
00:59:07,352 --> 00:59:09,286
真过瘾
I quite enjoyed that.

794
00:59:09,354 --> 00:59:11,754
希望他们会再邀请我
I hope I get another invite soon.

795
00:59:16,428 --> 00:59:20,159
幸好我们还有另外一棵圣诞树
Come on, come on!

796
00:59:18,103 --> 00:59:20,272
Good thing we have a spare.

797
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:25,597
可怜的棕树
Suffering snorkelblatz!

798
00:59:25,670 --> 00:59:28,264
他们太过份了
They're relentless!

799
00:59:33,612 --> 00:59:37,207
再四个小时就是圣诞节了
Only four hours till Christmas!

800
00:59:39,050 --> 00:59:42,884
是的，鬼灵精知道 所有胡谷镇的小朋友
<i>Yes, the Grinch knew tomorrow all the Who girls and boys...</i>

801
00:59:42,954 --> 00:59:46,151
明天一起床 就会拿到他们的礼物
<i>...would wake bright and early and rush for their toys.</i>

802
00:59:46,191 --> 00:59:49,592
接着就是，噪音
And then, the noise!

803
00:59:49,661 --> 00:59:54,030
天哪，没完没了的噪音
The noise, noise, noise!

804
00:59:54,099 --> 00:59:56,192
他们会敲锣打鼓
<i>They'll bang on tong-tinglers.</i>

805
00:59:56,301 --> 00:59:58,531
会吹喇叭
<i>They'll blow their floo-flounders.</i>

806
00:59:58,603 --> 01:00:02,539
会穿弹簧鞋乱冲，坐跳跳球乱跑
<i>They'll crash on jang-jinglers and bounce on boing-bounders!</i>

807
01:00:02,607 --> 01:00:06,304
然后胡谷镇的男女老幼会一起
<i>Then Whos young and old would sit down to a feast.</i>

808
01:00:06,378 --> 01:00:09,677
享用丰收的圣诞大餐
<i>And they'll feast and they'll feast.</i>

809
01:00:09,781 --> 01:00:13,717
然后他们会吃个不停
And they'll feast, feast, feast, feast!

810
01:00:13,785 --> 01:00:15,980
他们会吃胡谷布丁
They'll eat their Who pudding.

811
01:00:16,054 --> 01:00:19,956
还有吃招牌烤肉
<i>And rare Who roast beast!</i>

812
01:00:20,025 --> 01:00:24,394
另外我最不能忍受的一件事
But there's something I just cannot stand in the least.

813
01:00:24,462 --> 01:00:26,396
天哪
Oh, no.

814
01:00:26,464 --> 01:00:30,059
我开始语无伦次了
I'm speaking in rhyme!

815
01:00:34,973 --> 01:00:38,204
我讨厌你们
Blast you Whos!

816
01:00:42,447 --> 01:00:47,009
鬼灵精越是想到圣诞节
<i>And the more the Grinch thought of what Christmas would bring...</i>

817
01:00:47,118 --> 01:00:49,450
就越是觉得…
<i>...the more the Grinch thought:</i>

818
01:00:49,521 --> 01:00:52,513
我一定要阻止这件事
I must stop this whole thing.

819
01:00:53,825 --> 01:00:57,852
一年又一年，我已经受够了
Why, for year after year I've put up with it now!

820
01:00:57,929 --> 01:01:00,659
我要让他们过不到圣诞节
I must stop this Christmas from coming! But how?

821
01:01:00,732 --> 01:01:02,666
怎么阻止？

822
01:01:02,734 --> 01:01:05,532
用什么方法呢？
I mean, in what way?

823
01:01:07,605 --> 01:01:11,735
狗狗的圣诞节已经到了
<i>"Christmas is goin' to the dogs</i>

824
01:01:13,745 --> 01:01:17,408
我们切火鸡、倒酒来庆祝
<i>"We're scoffing down the turkey and the grog</i>

825
01:01:20,183 --> 01:01:22,686
<i>"Things are looking very good, it's true"</i>

826
01:01:24,122 --> 01:01:28,218
你在庆祝愉快的…
Are you having a holly, jolly...

827
01:01:28,293 --> 01:01:30,853
白色圣诞吗？
...Christmas?

828
01:01:31,663 --> 01:01:34,131
错
Wrong-o!

829
01:01:51,049 --> 01:01:53,142
你不帮我没关系
If you're not going to help me...

830
01:01:53,218 --> 01:01:56,449
至少你不要…
...then you might as well...

831
01:01:56,521 --> 01:02:01,083
他突然想到，一个邪恶的主意
<i>Then he got an idea.</i>

832
01:01:58,722 --> 01:02:00,891
<i>An awful idea.</i>

833
01:02:01,793 --> 01:02:04,261
鬼灵精想到一个非常…
<i>The Grinch got a wonderful...</i>

834
01:02:04,329 --> 01:02:06,627
邪恶的主意
<i>...awful idea.</i>

835
01:02:06,698 --> 01:02:11,260
我知道该怎么做了
I know just what to do.

836
01:02:19,277 --> 01:02:22,610
鬼灵精得意地笑着
<i>The Grinch laughed in his throat.</i>

837
01:02:22,714 --> 01:02:25,581
他缝了件圣诞老人装和顶帽子
<i>And he made a quick Santy Claus hat and a coat.</i>

838
01:02:28,620 --> 01:02:31,919
他不停地笑着
<i>And he chuckled and clucked...</i>

839
01:02:31,990 --> 01:02:34,049
感到十分得意
<i>...at this great Grinchy trick.</i>

840
01:02:34,125 --> 01:02:38,061
穿上外套和帽子 我就像圣诞老人了
With this coat and this hat, I'll look just like Saint Nick.

841
01:02:39,998 --> 01:02:43,058
小气鬼是鬼灵精
"You're a mean one, Mr. Grinch

842
01:02:44,102 --> 01:02:48,334
你非常难搞定
"You really are a heel

843
01:02:48,973 --> 01:02:53,000
脾气坏又小心眼 不可爱又讨人厌
<i>"You're as cuddly as a cactus and as charming as an eel</i>

844
01:02:53,077 --> 01:02:55,602
鬼灵精
<i>"Mr. Grinch</i>

845
01:02:56,414 --> 01:02:59,315
你是黑心肝的
<i>"You're a bad banana</i>

846
01:02:59,384 --> 01:03:02,820
老妖怪
<i>"With a greasy black peel</i>

847
01:03:07,892 --> 01:03:11,293
承认吧，你是妖怪
<i>"Just face the music, you're a monster</i>

848
01:03:11,362 --> 01:03:14,058
鬼灵精，你别想赖
<i>"Mr. Grinch, yes, you are</i>

849
01:03:14,132 --> 01:03:18,296
你没心又没肝
"Your heart's an empty hole

850
01:03:18,369 --> 01:03:22,533
你的思想有问题 你的人格有缺陷
<i>"Your brain is full of spiders You got garlic in your soul</i>

851
01:03:22,607 --> 01:03:26,099
鬼灵精
<i>"Mr. Grinch</i>

852
01:03:26,144 --> 01:03:29,705
我不敢惹你
<i>"I wouldn't touch you with a</i>

853
01:03:29,814 --> 01:03:33,841
除非我活得不耐烦
<i>"thirty-nine-and-a-half foot pole"</i>

854
01:03:44,529 --> 01:03:48,056
我要的是三英寸那支，不是这支
I asked for three-quarters, not five-eighths.

855
01:03:48,132 --> 01:03:50,191
专心点
Stay focused!

856
01:03:53,972 --> 01:03:55,599
“开始引擎测试”

857
01:03:55,673 --> 01:03:59,006
你要是问胡谷镇上的居民
<i>"You know, if you asked the who's who of Whoville</i>

858
01:04:00,311 --> 01:04:05,772
没人会否认
<i>"No one would deny it"</i>

859
01:04:09,153 --> 01:04:09,847
“撞这点”

860
01:04:24,035 --> 01:04:26,435
安全气囊反应有点慢
Air bag is a little slow.

861
01:04:28,873 --> 01:04:31,433
所以说，不测试不行
But that's what these tests are for!

862
01:04:32,310 --> 01:04:34,710
你是坏人
<i>"You're a vile one</i>

863
01:04:34,812 --> 01:04:37,246
鬼灵精
<i>"Mr. Grinch</i>

864
01:04:37,315 --> 01:04:41,843
你笑起来有蛀牙
<i>"You have termites in your smile</i>

865
01:04:41,953 --> 01:04:44,353
你的亲切和善
<i>"You have all the tender sweetness Of a seasick crocodile</i>

866
01:04:44,422 --> 01:04:46,447
让人恶心反胃

867
01:04:46,524 --> 01:04:48,788
鬼灵精
<i>"Mr. Grinch</i>

868
01:04:48,860 --> 01:04:49,827
“小气鬼”
"Given the choice between you

869
01:04:49,894 --> 01:04:53,193
两者让我选择

870
01:04:53,264 --> 01:04:59,032
我选让人恶心反胃
"I'd take the seasick crocodile"

871
01:05:18,556 --> 01:05:22,117
胖家伙应该就快好了
Fat boy should be finishing up anytime now.

872
01:05:23,161 --> 01:05:25,129
说到离群索居
Talk about a recluse.

873
01:05:25,163 --> 01:05:29,532
为什么大家就欢迎他 每年来光临一次
He only comes out once a year, and he never catches any flak for it!

874
01:05:30,802 --> 01:05:33,794
他住那么远八成是为了逃税
Probably lives up there to avoid the taxes.

875
01:05:35,340 --> 01:05:38,173
圣诞快乐
Merry Christmas!

876
01:05:39,985 --> 01:05:41,278
Oopsie.

877
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:45,472
忘记有糜鹿了
Forgot about the reindeer.

878
01:05:45,583 --> 01:05:48,575
鬼灵精有没有因此而放弃？
<i>Did that stop the old Grinch?</i>

879
01:05:48,987 --> 01:05:53,014
没有，他只是说…
<i>No.</i>

880
01:05:50,620 --> 01:05:52,706
<i>The Grinch simply said:</i>

881
01:05:53,091 --> 01:05:55,685
要是找不到糜鹿
If I can't find a reindeer...

882
01:05:56,527 --> 01:06:00,019
那我就自制一只
...I'll make one instead.

883
01:06:04,135 --> 01:06:08,333
小狗狗！
Oh, Max!

884
01:06:09,841 --> 01:06:13,607
“请勿打扰” 于是他把麦斯叫来
<i>So he called his dog Max...</i>

885
01:06:13,745 --> 01:06:15,713
找了一捆红线
<i>...and he took some red thread...</i>

886
01:06:15,813 --> 01:06:19,408
在它头上绑了一只角
<i>...and tied a big horn on top of his head.</i>

887
01:06:22,887 --> 01:06:25,287
好啦，你是糜鹿
All right.

888
01:06:25,390 --> 01:06:28,416
这是动机，你叫鲁道夫
You're a reindeer. Here's your motivation.

889
01:06:28,493 --> 01:06:30,518
你是红鼻子怪胎，没人喜欢你
You're Rudolph, a freak with a red nose, nobody likes you.

890
01:06:30,595 --> 01:06:33,689
有一天圣诞老人看上你 你救了圣诞节
Then one day, Santa picks you and you save Christmas.

891
01:06:35,800 --> 01:06:38,496
算了，我们来改写历史
No, forget that part. We'll improvise.

892
01:06:38,569 --> 01:06:41,037
但是不要太夸张
Just keep it kind of loosey-goosey.

893
01:06:41,105 --> 01:06:43,505
你讨厌圣诞节，所以要偷走
You hate Christmas! You're gonna steal it!

894
01:06:43,574 --> 01:06:47,305
拯救圣诞的结局 太老土、太商业化了
Saving Christmas was a lousy ending. Way too commercial.

895
01:06:48,780 --> 01:06:50,873
开始！
<i>Action!</i>

896
01:06:52,583 --> 01:06:54,107
太棒了
Brilliant!

897
01:06:54,185 --> 01:06:56,551
你拒绝戴假鼻子
You reject your own nose...

898
01:06:56,587 --> 01:06:59,112
因为你不想帮人打广告
...because it represents the glitter of commercialism!

899
01:06:59,157 --> 01:07:01,148
我怎么没想到？
Why didn't I think of that?

900
01:07:01,225 --> 01:07:04,092
停拍，收工，关门，出发
Cut, print, check the gate. Moving on.

901
01:07:13,504 --> 01:07:19,101
感觉…不错
That...

902
01:07:14,871 --> 01:07:16,289
...feels...

903
01:07:16,373 --> 01:07:18,500
...good.

904
01:07:29,520 --> 01:07:32,614
笨狗，看我的
Here goes nothin', hot dog!

905
01:07:38,478 --> 01:07:39,604
Wow!

906
01:07:41,899 --> 01:07:43,594
“满油”

907
01:07:53,778 --> 01:07:56,338
成功了
This is nuts!

908
01:07:58,116 --> 01:08:00,311
目标正前方
On, Crasher! On, Thrasher!

909
01:08:00,384 --> 01:08:02,818
全速前进
On, Vomit and Blitzkrieg!

910
01:08:11,429 --> 01:08:14,956
完蛋了，我们死定了
We're gonna die!

911
01:08:13,055 --> 01:08:14,806
We're gonna die!

912
01:08:15,032 --> 01:08:18,593
我要吐了，吐完再死
I'm going to throw up, and then I'm gonna die!

913
01:08:20,938 --> 01:08:25,034
妈，快来救我
Mommy, tell it to stop!

914
01:08:43,194 --> 01:08:45,924
差点失去我的冷静
Almost lost my cool there.

915
01:08:51,002 --> 01:08:54,870
窗外的雪静静地下着
<i>All their windows were dark. Quiet snow filled the air.</i>

916
01:08:54,939 --> 01:08:59,876
居民们毫无戒心的睡着
<i>All the Whos were all dreaming sweet dreams without care...</i>

917
01:08:59,944 --> 01:09:02,572
他来到镇上第一户人家
<i>...when he came to the first little house on the square.</i>

918
01:09:02,680 --> 01:09:05,148
麦斯，欢迎光临胡谷镇
Welcome to Whoville, Max.

919
01:09:12,490 --> 01:09:13,923
贝蒂
Betty?

920
01:09:13,991 --> 01:09:15,390
贝蒂 干嘛？
- Betty? - What?

921
01:09:15,459 --> 01:09:17,450
有没有听到声音？
Did you hear something?

922
01:09:18,896 --> 01:09:20,659
是圣诞老人
It's Santa!

923
01:09:20,731 --> 01:09:22,722
继续睡
Go right back to sleep.

924
01:09:28,039 --> 01:09:31,372
走吧，麦斯，我们的第一站
Come on, Max. It's our first stop.

925
01:09:31,442 --> 01:09:33,910
鬼灵精得意地偷笑
<i>The old Grinchy Claus hissed.</i>

926
01:09:33,978 --> 01:09:36,970
他拿着空袋子，跳到屋顶上
<i>And he climbed to the roof, empty bags in his fist.</i>

927
01:09:37,081 --> 01:09:40,380
他打算从烟囱滑下去
<i>He'd slide down the chimney. A rather tight pinch.</i>

928
01:09:40,451 --> 01:09:43,887
既然圣诞老人都挤得进去
<i>But if Santa could do it, then so could the Grinch.</i>

929
01:09:43,955 --> 01:09:47,015
他要尝试转体两圈半
He's planning a double-twisting interrupted forward-flying 2-and-a-half...

930
01:09:47,091 --> 01:09:49,082
配合上抱膝动作
...with a combo tuck and pike.

931
01:09:49,160 --> 01:09:51,094
属于高难度
High degree of difficulty.

932
01:09:59,036 --> 01:10:02,494
他被卡住了一两下子
<i>He got stuck only once, for a moment or two.</i>

933
01:10:02,573 --> 01:10:06,475
该死的体重，全在我的屁股上
Blasted water weight! Goes right to my hips.

934
01:10:16,053 --> 01:10:18,920
接着他从壁炉探头出来
<i>Then he stuck his head out of the fireplace flue.</i>

935
01:10:20,291 --> 01:10:22,555
拜托，小声一点
A little more stealth, please.

936
01:10:22,627 --> 01:10:25,562
一排长袜挂在壁炉边
<i>Where the little Who stockings all hung in a row.</i>

937
01:10:25,630 --> 01:10:27,655
这些袜子… 他笑着说
These stockings...

938
01:10:27,732 --> 01:10:30,200
第一批送走
<i>...he grinned...</i>

939
01:10:27,856 --> 01:10:29,691
...are the first thing to go.

940
01:10:30,268 --> 01:10:32,668
伙伴们，吃饭时间
Okay, fellas. Show time.

941
01:11:04,435 --> 01:11:07,632
然后他冲向冰箱
<i>Then he slunk to the icebox.</i>

942
01:11:07,705 --> 01:11:09,536
冲？
Slunk?

943
01:11:11,342 --> 01:11:13,333
他看到了招牌烤肉
<i>He eyed the Whos' feast. He took the Who pudding.</i>

944
01:11:13,411 --> 01:11:16,175
他拿了胡谷布丁

945
01:11:16,247 --> 01:11:18,875
他拿了招牌烤肉
<i>He took the roast beast.</i>

946
01:11:19,016 --> 01:11:20,711
来啦！
Hike!

947
01:11:20,785 --> 01:11:24,050
他把冰箱一扫而空
<i>He cleaned out that icebox as quick as a flash.</i>

948
01:11:24,121 --> 01:11:28,080
连最后一罐马铃薯泥都不放过
<i>Why, that Grinch, he even took their last can of Who hash.</i>

949
01:11:28,592 --> 01:11:32,460
他把所有的食物从烟囱送出去
<i>Then he stuffed all the food up the chimney with glee.</i>

950
01:11:32,530 --> 01:11:36,432
接下来 鬼灵精笑着说…
And now...

951
01:11:34,631 --> 01:11:36,550
<i>...grinned the Grinch...</i>

952
01:11:38,536 --> 01:11:40,800
我要拿圣诞树走
...I'll stuff up the tree.

953
01:11:40,871 --> 01:11:43,931
当他抓着树往壁炉走的时候
<i>And the Grinch grabbed the tree, and he started to shove...</i>

954
01:11:44,041 --> 01:11:47,704
他听到清脆的声音在身后响起
<i>...when he heard a small sound like the coo of a dove.</i>

955
01:11:47,812 --> 01:11:50,007
对不起
Excuse me.

956
01:11:55,453 --> 01:11:58,388
鬼灵精被一名小女孩逮到了
<i>The Grinch had been caught by this tiny Who daughter...</i>

957
01:11:58,456 --> 01:12:01,220
她刚好起床喝水
<i>...who'd got out of bed for a cup of cold water.</i>

958
01:12:01,292 --> 01:12:05,023
圣诞老人 你拿我们的圣诞树干嘛？
Santa Claus? What are you doing with our tree?

959
01:12:05,096 --> 01:12:10,033
但是鬼灵精太聪明、太狡猾了
<i>But, you know, that old Grinch was so smart and so slick...</i>

960
01:12:10,868 --> 01:12:13,894
他马上想到了一个藉口
<i>...he thought up a lie, and he thought it up quick.</i>

961
01:12:13,971 --> 01:12:18,874
哦，可爱的小妹妹
Why...

962
01:12:15,756 --> 01:12:18,592
...my sweet little tot.

963
01:12:18,943 --> 01:12:20,570
假圣诞老人骗她
<i>The fake Santa Claus lied.</i>

964
01:12:20,678 --> 01:12:25,479
圣诞树上有粒灯泡坏了
There's a light on this tree...

965
01:12:23,847 --> 01:12:25,265
...that won't...

966
01:12:25,549 --> 01:12:27,449
就在这边
...light on one side.

967
01:12:27,518 --> 01:12:31,352
所以我要带回我家去修
So I'm taking it home to my workshop, my dear.

968
01:12:36,894 --> 01:12:39,454
我回去修好以后
I'll fix it up there...

969
01:12:39,530 --> 01:12:43,193
再送回来给你
...and I'll bring it back here.

970
01:12:44,869 --> 01:12:46,962
圣诞节的意义是什么？
Santa, what's Christmas really about?

971
01:12:47,071 --> 01:12:49,437
报复
Vengeance!

972
01:12:50,775 --> 01:12:52,709
我是说…
I mean...

973
01:12:54,678 --> 01:12:57,169
礼物
...presents...

974
01:12:57,214 --> 01:12:59,307
我猜吧
...I suppose.

975
01:13:02,720 --> 01:13:05,450
我就是怕这样
I was afraid of that.

976
01:13:05,523 --> 01:13:09,459
他骗过了小女孩
<i>And his fib fooled the child.</i>

977
01:13:09,527 --> 01:13:12,860
拍拍她的头，帮她拿了杯水
<i>Then he patted her head, and he got her a drink...</i>

978
01:13:12,930 --> 01:13:15,296
叫她回去睡觉
<i>...and he sent her to bed.</i>

979
01:13:23,207 --> 01:13:24,265
圣诞老公公
Santa?

980
01:13:24,375 --> 01:13:27,173
干嘛？ 别忘了鬼灵精家
- What? - Don't forget the Grinch.

981
01:13:29,113 --> 01:13:32,742
他是脾气不好，又长了一身毛
I know he's mean and hairy and smelly.

982
01:13:32,850 --> 01:13:36,752
虽然他的手又冰又凉
His hands might be cold and clammy.

983
01:13:36,821 --> 01:13:40,484
可是我觉得他蛮可爱的
But I think he's actually kind of sweet.

984
01:13:40,558 --> 01:13:42,924
可爱？
Sweet?

985
01:13:48,065 --> 01:13:50,829
你认为他可爱？
You think he's sweet?

986
01:13:52,169 --> 01:13:54,194
圣诞快乐
Merry Christmas, Santa.

987
01:14:00,945 --> 01:14:03,880
当辛蒂卢拿杯子回房间的时候
<i>And when Cindy Lou went up with her cup...</i>

988
01:14:03,948 --> 01:14:06,508
好小孩
Nice kid.

989
01:14:06,617 --> 01:14:09,518
可惜不会看人
Bad judge of character.

990
01:14:09,587 --> 01:14:13,318
他把圣诞树从烟囱塞出去
<i>...he went to the chimney and stuffed the tree up.</i>

991
01:14:15,059 --> 01:14:17,527
“圣诞老人入口”

992
01:14:21,198 --> 01:14:24,531
最后还拿走他们的木材
<i>And the last thing he took was the log for their fire.</i>

993
01:14:24,602 --> 01:14:28,902
墙上只留下挂钩和电线
<i>On their walls he left nothing but some hooks and some wire.</i>

994
01:14:28,973 --> 01:14:31,407
他留下的一点食物
<i>And the one speck of food that he'd left in the house...</i>

995
01:14:31,475 --> 01:14:35,343
还不够老鼠塞牙缝
<i>...was a crumb that was even too small for a mouse.</i>

996
01:14:38,382 --> 01:14:42,648
然后他一脸奸笑、蹑手蹑脚
<i>Then he slithered and slunk, with a smile most unpleasant...</i>

997
01:14:42,720 --> 01:14:46,451
挨家挨户地搜刮所有的礼物
<i>...around each Who home, and he took every present.</i>

998
01:14:57,668 --> 01:15:01,126
清仓大拍卖，一件也不留
Clearance sale.

999
01:14:58,919 --> 01:15:00,879
Everything must go.

1000
01:15:13,717 --> 01:15:16,117
又怎么了？
What now?

1001
01:15:52,489 --> 01:15:56,789
你有亲过割了两次 扁桃腺的人吗？
Martha...

1002
01:15:52,723 --> 01:15:56,601
...have you ever kissed a man who lost his tonsils twice?

1003
01:15:57,595 --> 01:15:59,756
没有，傻瓜
No, silly!

1004
01:16:03,601 --> 01:16:07,469
但是我一直希望有这样的经验
But it's an experience that I've always longed for.

1005
01:16:07,538 --> 01:16:09,563
吻我吧，傻瓜
Kiss me, you fool!

1006
01:17:26,617 --> 01:17:28,915
“没油”

1007
01:17:32,056 --> 01:17:35,150
你笑什么笑？
What are you laughing at...

1008
01:17:35,225 --> 01:17:37,591
鲁道夫
...Rudolph?

1009
01:17:37,661 --> 01:17:40,061
麦斯，全靠你了
It's all you, Maxie!

1010
01:17:40,130 --> 01:17:43,691
三千英尺高的松饼山峰上
<i>3,000 feet up, up the side of Mount Crumpit...</i>

1011
01:17:43,767 --> 01:17:47,430
他驾着车到山顶倒礼物
<i>...he rode with his load to the tiptop to dump it.</i>

1012
01:17:57,181 --> 01:18:02,551
我们成功了
We did it!

1013
01:18:05,731 --> 01:18:07,733
We did it! We did it!

1014
01:18:08,459 --> 01:18:10,484
还不错吧？麦斯
That wasn't so bad, was it, Max?

1015
01:18:13,964 --> 01:18:16,558
他们现在应该醒了
They'll be waking up now.

1016
01:18:18,102 --> 01:18:22,163
我知道他们会干嘛
And I know just what they'll do.

1017
01:18:22,239 --> 01:18:26,903
那些胡谷镇的居民
<i>All those Whos...</i>

1018
01:18:25,375 --> 01:18:27,085
<i>...down in Whoville...</i>

1019
01:18:26,977 --> 01:18:29,969
一定会哭
<i>...will all cry.</i>

1020
01:18:47,664 --> 01:18:50,189
太丢脸，连我都被抢
What an embarrassment! I've been robbed!

1021
01:19:20,330 --> 01:19:23,322
镇长大人？天哪
Mayor May-Who? Oh, dear.

1022
01:19:29,406 --> 01:19:34,105
真想不出来有谁会干这种事
I wonder who could have done this.

1023
01:19:34,812 --> 01:19:36,575
告诉你们吧
Tell you people one thing:

1024
01:19:36,713 --> 01:19:39,580
邀请鬼灵精
Invite the Grinch...

1025
01:19:39,650 --> 01:19:41,584
圣诞节就没了
...destroy Christmas.

1026
01:19:41,652 --> 01:19:46,612
邀请鬼灵精，圣诞节就没了
Invite the Grinch...

1027
01:19:43,453 --> 01:19:46,248
...destroy Christmas!

1028
01:19:49,393 --> 01:19:52,157
但是有人听吗？
But did anyone listen to me?

1029
01:19:52,229 --> 01:19:54,163
我有 没有
- I did. - No.

1030
01:19:54,231 --> 01:19:57,894
你们宁可听…
You choose to listen...

1031
01:19:57,968 --> 01:20:02,064
一个搞不清状况的小女孩
...to a little not-to-be-taken-seriously girl...

1032
01:20:02,706 --> 01:20:06,198
什么都不懂的小女孩
...who hasn't even grown into her nose yet.

1033
01:20:07,678 --> 01:20:12,581
辛蒂，我希望你现在高兴了
Cindy, I hope you're very proud...

1034
01:20:11,148 --> 01:20:12,441
...of what you've done.

1035
01:20:21,258 --> 01:20:23,351
就算她没有，我有
If she isn't, I am.

1036
01:20:25,329 --> 01:20:27,354
我很高兴他拿走我们的礼物
I'm glad he took our presents.

1037
01:20:28,899 --> 01:20:31,163
什么？ 我…
- What? - I...

1038
01:20:32,202 --> 01:20:34,397
我…我很高兴

1039
01:20:34,471 --> 01:20:37,304
他很高兴，你很高兴
- I'm glad. - He's glad.

1040
01:20:37,374 --> 01:20:39,865
你很高兴我们什么都没有
You're glad. You're glad everything is gone.

1041
01:20:40,911 --> 01:20:42,902
你很高兴鬼灵精…
You're glad that the Grinch virtually wrecked...

1042
01:20:43,013 --> 01:20:45,072
彻底破坏了

1043
01:20:45,148 --> 01:20:47,673
不是破坏，是摧毁了圣诞节
No, not wrecked, pulverized Christmas.

1044
01:20:47,784 --> 01:20:49,649
你的意思是不是这样？
Is that what I'm hearing?

1045
01:20:50,487 --> 01:20:52,717
镇长先生，没有人能破坏圣诞节
You can't hurt Christmas, Mr. Mayor...

1046
01:20:52,789 --> 01:20:56,350
圣诞节不是礼物、比赛 不是漂亮的灯饰
...because it isn't about the gifts or the contests or the fancy lights.

1047
01:20:56,426 --> 01:21:00,590
这就是辛蒂想要让大家知道的
That's what Cindy's been trying to tell everyone.

1048
01:21:00,664 --> 01:21:02,894
还有我，她想要让我知道
And me. She's been trying to tell me.

1049
01:21:02,966 --> 01:21:06,493
你有毛病啊？她只是个小孩
What is wrong with you? This is a child.

1050
01:21:07,204 --> 01:21:11,937
她是我的小孩，而且她是对的
She's my child.

1051
01:21:08,997 --> 01:21:11,833
And she happens to be right, by the way.

1052
01:21:20,317 --> 01:21:24,754
圣诞节我需要的是我的家人 不是别的
I don't need anything more for Christmas than this right here, my family.

1053
01:21:27,157 --> 01:21:31,355
圣诞快乐，各位 圣诞快乐
- Merry Christmas, everybody! - Merry Christmas!

1054
01:21:32,496 --> 01:21:36,762
圣诞快乐，大帅哥
Merry Christmas, you hunk of burnin' Who!

1055
01:21:43,774 --> 01:21:45,969
饶了我吧
Give me a break.

1056
01:21:53,650 --> 01:21:54,810
圣诞快乐
Merry Christmas!

1057
01:22:07,230 --> 01:22:11,291
鬼灵精先生？
Mr. Grinch?

1058
01:22:09,975 --> 01:22:11,935
Mr. Grinch?

1059
01:22:12,202 --> 01:22:15,137
我伟大计划的最后一步
Now for the final note in my symphony...

1060
01:22:15,172 --> 01:22:18,164
倒掉所有的烂礼物
...of downright nasty not-niceness!

1061
01:22:18,241 --> 01:22:21,506
完成我的杰作
The crescendo of my odious opus!

1062
01:22:21,645 --> 01:22:24,341
太棒了

1063
01:22:26,550 --> 01:22:30,316
哭泣和哀求
The wailing and the gnashing of teeth.

1064
01:22:30,387 --> 01:22:35,256
咒骂和怒吼
The bellowing of the bitterly bummed out!

1065
01:22:35,325 --> 01:22:38,954
就像是对我的歌颂
It'll be like music to my ears!

1066
01:22:47,137 --> 01:22:51,369
鬼灵精听到雪中传来了声音
<i>Then the Grinch heard a sound rising over the snow.</i>

1067
01:22:51,441 --> 01:22:55,502
从小声变得越来越大声
<i>It started in low. Then it started to grow.</i>

1068
01:22:57,748 --> 01:23:00,581
但那声音听起来并不悲伤
<i>But the sound wasn't sad.</i>

1069
01:23:00,684 --> 01:23:04,279
反而非常快乐
<i>Why, this sounded merry.</i>

1070
01:23:04,354 --> 01:23:08,415
非常，非常地快乐
<i>But it was merry.</i>

1071
01:23:08,492 --> 01:23:12,485
胡谷镇的男女老幼
<i>Very.</i>

1072
01:23:08,659 --> 01:23:12,579
<i>Every Who down in Whoville, the tall and the small...</i>

1073
01:23:12,562 --> 01:23:16,089
没有了礼物仍旧在唱歌
<i>...were singing without any presents at all.</i>

1074
01:23:22,105 --> 01:23:25,768
他没有办法阻止圣诞节
<i>He hadn't stopped Christmas from coming.</i>

1075
01:23:25,842 --> 01:23:29,334
无论如何，还是来了
<i>It came.</i>

1076
01:23:26,009 --> 01:23:29,262
Somehow or other, it came just the same!

1077
01:23:33,116 --> 01:23:35,050
鬼灵精先生？
Mr. Grinch?

1078
01:23:36,853 --> 01:23:41,119
鬼灵精呆站在雪地上
<i>And the Grinch, with his Grinch feet ice-cold in the snow...</i>

1079
01:23:41,158 --> 01:23:44,184
觉得非常迷惘
<i>...stood puzzling and puzzling.</i>

1080
01:23:44,261 --> 01:23:46,456
怎么可能？
How could it be so?

1081
01:23:46,530 --> 01:23:48,794
明明没有蝴蝶结
It came without ribbons!

1082
01:23:49,066 --> 01:23:51,057
没有标签
It came without tags!

1083
01:23:51,568 --> 01:23:55,504
没有包装，没有盒子 怎么还是有圣诞节？
It came without packages, boxes or bags!

1084
01:23:58,041 --> 01:24:00,908
他怎么想都想不通
<i>And he puzzled and puzzled...</i>

1085
01:24:00,977 --> 01:24:03,445
想到他头都痛了
<i>...till his puzzler was sore.</i>

1086
01:24:05,916 --> 01:24:09,818
然后他想到一件事
<i>Then the Grinch thought of something...</i>

1087
01:24:09,886 --> 01:24:11,854
以前从来没想到过
<i>...he hadn't before.</i>

1088
01:24:11,955 --> 01:24:15,516
也许圣诞节
Maybe...

1089
01:24:15,592 --> 01:24:17,526
他想…
...Christmas...

1090
01:24:15,726 --> 01:24:17,644
<i>...he thought...</i>

1091
01:24:19,863 --> 01:24:24,459
和礼物一点关系都没有
...doesn't come from a store.

1092
01:24:27,304 --> 01:24:30,364
圣诞节
Maybe Christmas...

1093
01:24:30,440 --> 01:24:32,374
也许
...perhaps...

1094
01:24:37,581 --> 01:24:40,072
有更深的意义
...means a little bit more.

1095
01:25:13,517 --> 01:25:15,178
救救我
Help me!

1096
01:25:15,252 --> 01:25:17,880
我…
I'm...

1097
01:25:17,954 --> 01:25:20,718
有感觉了
...feeling!

1098
01:25:26,196 --> 01:25:28,687
后来发生的事
<i>And what happened then...</i>

1099
01:25:28,765 --> 01:25:31,427
据胡谷镇的居民说
<i>...well, in Whoville they say...</i>

1100
01:25:31,501 --> 01:25:34,163
鬼灵精狭窄的心胸
<i>...that the Grinch's small heart...</i>

1101
01:25:34,204 --> 01:25:38,368
在那天变大了三倍
<i>...grew three sizes that day.</i>

1102
01:26:09,239 --> 01:26:12,731
我是怎么了？
What's happening to me?

1103
01:26:36,299 --> 01:26:38,961
我…
I'm all...

1104
01:26:39,035 --> 01:26:41,526
觉得好感动
...toasty inside.

1105
01:26:47,978 --> 01:26:50,412
而且我在哭
And I'm leaking.

1106
01:26:53,650 --> 01:26:54,947
喔，麦斯
Oh, Max.

1107
01:26:58,188 --> 01:27:00,452
我爱你
I love you!

1108
01:27:07,697 --> 01:27:11,758
好了，别舔了，滚开
All right, that's enough. Knock it off. Beat it!

1109
01:27:11,835 --> 01:27:16,169
别猴急，我需要慢慢来
Get out of here!

1110
01:27:14,029 --> 01:27:15,906
One step at a time.

1111
01:27:23,980 --> 01:27:27,279
糟了，雪橇，还有礼物
No. The sleigh. The presents.

1112
01:27:27,617 --> 01:27:30,245
我绝对不能让雪橇掉下去
They'll be destroyed!

1113
01:27:29,044 --> 01:27:30,420
And I care!

1114
01:27:30,587 --> 01:27:34,023
我竟然会关心这种事？
What is the deal?

1115
01:27:34,190 --> 01:27:36,249
等一下
Wait!

1116
01:27:37,027 --> 01:27:38,460
绝对不行
This can't happen!

1117
01:27:38,628 --> 01:27:42,325
千万不能让它掉下去
It shouldn't! It couldn't! It mustn't! It wouldn't!

1118
01:27:42,399 --> 01:27:45,425
绝对不可以掉下去
Not now, not then, not ever again!

1119
01:27:55,312 --> 01:27:56,779
不！
No!

1120
01:28:45,562 --> 01:28:47,792
算了
Oh, well.

1121
01:28:47,864 --> 01:28:50,526
反正只是玩具
It's just toys, right?

1122
01:28:51,701 --> 01:28:53,828
你好，鬼灵精先生
Hi, Mr. Grinch!

1123
01:28:55,672 --> 01:28:57,341
Cindy Lou!

1124
01:28:57,507 --> 01:28:59,941
你在上面干嘛？
What are you doing up there?

1125
01:29:00,043 --> 01:29:02,273
我来看你的
I came to see you. No one should be alone on Christmas.

1126
01:29:02,379 --> 01:29:04,609
你不应该一个人过圣诞节

1127
01:29:20,864 --> 01:29:21,907
No!

1128
01:29:52,729 --> 01:29:56,165
辛蒂卢，不要怕
I got you, Cindy Lou!

1129
01:29:56,766 --> 01:29:58,859
你办到了
You did it!

1130
01:30:39,375 --> 01:30:42,139
起飞，着地
Spread eagle! Nailed it!

1131
01:30:59,195 --> 01:31:02,892
你没事吧？ 太小看我了
Are you all right?

1132
01:31:02,966 --> 01:31:05,730
这么好的天气，这么棒的雪
Are you kiddin'?

1133
01:31:02,924 --> 01:31:05,385
The sun is bright and the powder's bitchin'!

1134
01:31:05,802 --> 01:31:08,794
坐过去，换我来
Now scoot over! It's my turn to drive!

1135
01:31:15,645 --> 01:31:17,306
最好慢一点
I'd better slow this buggy down!

1136
01:31:20,350 --> 01:31:22,841
我们要撞车了
- We're gonna crash! - Now you listen to me, young lady!

1137
01:31:22,952 --> 01:31:24,886
你听我说

1138
01:31:24,988 --> 01:31:28,185
就算我们撞得乱七八糟
Even if we're horribly mangled...

1139
01:31:28,224 --> 01:31:30,658
也不准在圣诞节愁眉苦脸的
...there'll be no sad faces on Christmas.

1140
01:31:42,906 --> 01:31:44,737
那是什么？ 救命
What is it?

1141
01:31:44,974 --> 01:31:45,770
辛蒂！
Help!

1142
01:31:46,042 --> 01:31:46,906
鬼灵精！
- Cindy! - Grinch?

1143
01:31:49,279 --> 01:31:51,076
我的女儿
My baby!

1144
01:31:54,384 --> 01:31:56,318
玛莎，抓住另外一头
Grab an end.

1145
01:31:56,386 --> 01:31:59,219
这些灯和你的睡衣很配
By the way, these lights match your outfit perfectly.

1146
01:32:01,424 --> 01:32:04,018
这下子麻烦大了
This could be more difficult to negotiate.

1147
01:32:04,093 --> 01:32:06,721
胡谷镇，我来啦
Heads up, Whoville!

1148
01:32:06,796 --> 01:32:09,731
快点，他来了
Hurry! Here he comes!

1149
01:32:09,799 --> 01:32:12,597
快闪开，我没保险
Out of the way! I have no insurance!

1150
01:32:15,638 --> 01:32:17,629
糟了
Yeah!

1151
01:32:24,147 --> 01:32:27,639
快逃，我停不下来
Run for your lives!

1152
01:32:25,173 --> 01:32:27,259
Watch out, I can't stop!

1153
01:32:28,985 --> 01:32:31,715
爸，让开 爸，快让开
- Daddy, move! - Dad, move it!

1154
01:32:42,465 --> 01:32:43,830
多谢帮忙
Thanks for the help.

1155
01:32:44,067 --> 01:32:46,111
- Hi, Daddy! - Hi, Cindy, honey!

1156
01:32:45,635 --> 01:32:50,504
大家圣诞快乐
Merry Christmas...

1157
01:32:48,864 --> 01:32:50,198
...one and all!

1158
01:32:50,324 --> 01:32:51,366
Cindy!

1159
01:32:53,410 --> 01:32:54,453
Mommy!

1160
01:33:02,518 --> 01:33:04,315
好啦
All right.

1161
01:33:04,387 --> 01:33:07,982
怎么回事啊？
What do we have here?

1162
01:33:08,057 --> 01:33:10,525
警官，问得好
You got me, Officer!

1163
01:33:11,494 --> 01:33:12,756
是我做的
I did it!

1164
01:33:12,829 --> 01:33:15,764
圣诞礼物是我，鬼灵精偷的
I'm the Grinch that stole Christmas.

1165
01:33:17,100 --> 01:33:20,536
我很抱歉
And I'm...

1166
01:33:19,061 --> 01:33:20,395
...sorry.

1167
01:33:25,141 --> 01:33:27,109
你不抓我吗？
Aren't you gonna cuff me?

1168
01:33:27,143 --> 01:33:30,135
不制伏我？不拿喷雾器喷我？
Put me in a choke hold? Blind me with pepper spray?

1169
01:33:30,246 --> 01:33:32,840
你都听到了，他承认了
You heard him, Officer. He admitted it.

1170
01:33:33,483 --> 01:33:35,417
快拿喷雾器喷他
- I'd go with the pepper spray. - Yes, I heard him, all right.

1171
01:33:35,485 --> 01:33:37,419
没错，我是有听到

1172
01:33:38,454 --> 01:33:41,651
他说他很抱歉
He said he was sorry.

1173
01:33:41,724 --> 01:33:45,888
再说，东西全都找回来了
Besides, it looks like everything is all here and accounted for.

1174
01:33:45,962 --> 01:33:47,896
你们帮忙说句话啊
Help me out here, people.

1175
01:33:48,631 --> 01:33:49,495
玛莎？
Martha?

1176
01:33:49,565 --> 01:33:53,524
圣诞快乐，奥古斯胡
Merry Christmas, August May-Who!

1177
01:33:53,603 --> 01:33:56,970
我有样东西要给你
I'm afraid I do have something for you!

1178
01:34:07,917 --> 01:34:10,147
你的戒指，还你
Your ring back.

1179
01:34:10,186 --> 01:34:14,145
抱歉，我喜欢的…
Sorry...

1180
01:34:11,571 --> 01:34:13,824
...but my heart belongs to...

1181
01:34:14,223 --> 01:34:16,157
是别人
...someone else.

1182
01:34:31,841 --> 01:34:33,775
别介意
No hard feelings?

1183
01:34:41,217 --> 01:34:42,775
老兄，圣诞节，高兴点
Cheer up, dude. It's Christmas.

1184
01:34:57,533 --> 01:34:59,797
鬼灵精先生，圣诞快乐
Merry Christmas, Mr. Grinch.

1185
01:35:04,107 --> 01:35:05,972
你的脸颊…
Your cheek is so...

1186
01:35:06,042 --> 01:35:09,773
我知道，毛毛的
I know.

1187
01:35:09,879 --> 01:35:12,439
不是 油油的？
Hairy?

1188
01:35:10,380 --> 01:35:12,257
- No. - Greasy?

1189
01:35:12,548 --> 01:35:15,312
臭臭的？我有长痘痘吗？
Stinky? Do I have a zit?

1190
01:35:15,594 --> 01:35:16,720
No.

1191
01:35:18,154 --> 01:35:20,088
暖暖的
Warm.

1192
01:35:26,605 --> 01:35:31,693
"Fah who foraze, dah who doraze

1193
01:35:31,667 --> 01:35:34,101
欢迎圣诞
"Welcome, Christmas, come this way

1194
01:35:34,137 --> 01:35:36,731
请进来

01:35:36,657 --> 01:35:41,244
"Fah who foraze, dah who doraze

1196
01:35:41,477 --> 01:35:43,843
欢迎圣诞
"Welcome, Christmas, Christmas Day

1197
01:35:43,946 --> 01:35:46,506
圣诞节

1198
01:35:46,616 --> 01:35:48,880
欢迎，欢迎
"Welcome, welcome, fah who rahmus

1199
01:35:51,487 --> 01:35:53,819
欢迎，欢迎
"Welcome, welcome, dah who dahmus

1200
01:35:56,526 --> 01:36:01,156
圣诞节就在我们手中
"Christmas Day is in our grasp

1201
01:36:01,197 --> 01:36:06,294
只要我们双手紧握
"So long as we have hands to clasp

1202
01:36:06,520 --> 01:36:11,483
"Fah who ray-moo ya-who hee haw

1203
01:36:11,474 --> 01:36:15,001
欢迎圣诞，唱出你的…
"Welcome, Christmas, bring your cheer

1204
01:36:15,077 --> 01:36:17,045
欢呼 欢呼
"Fah who foraze

1205
01:36:19,116 --> 01:36:24,037
"Dah who doraze, welcome all Whos

1206
01:36:21,384 --> 01:36:23,852
欢迎胡谷镇所有的居民

1207
01:36:23,920 --> 01:36:26,582
远…
"far

1208
01:36:26,656 --> 01:36:29,489

近
"near"

1210
01:36:33,329 --> 01:36:37,095
他送回来所有的礼物和食物
<i>So he brought back the toys and the food for the feast.</i>

1211
01:36:37,166 --> 01:36:42,263
而鬼灵精，他亲自切了烤肉
<i>And he, he himself, the Grinch...</i>

1212
01:36:40,554 --> 01:36:42,389
<i>...carved the roast beast.</i>

1213
01:36:42,338 --> 01:36:44,704
好耶！
Yeah!

1214
01:36:58,421 --> 01:37:00,184
没有比过节更棒的了
There's nothin' like the holidays.

1215
01:37:00,256 --> 01:37:02,622
有谁要鸡胗？ 我要
- Who wants the gizzard? - I do!

1216
01:37:02,692 --> 01:37:05,593
太慢了，我自己要
Too late!

1217
01:37:03,952 --> 01:37:05,329
That'll be mine.

1218
01:37:05,661 --> 01:37:09,563
终于找到
<i>"Where are you, Christmas?</i>

1219
01:37:09,632 --> 01:37:13,796
圣诞影踪
<i>"I think I've found you</i>

1220
01:37:13,870 --> 01:37:19,934
愿此刻永远停留
<i>"This time I'll make you stay</i>

1221
01:37:20,009 --> 01:37:23,843
歌声唱起
<i>"All will be singing</i>

1222
01:37:23,946 --> 01:37:27,848
铃声响起
<i>"Bells will be ringing</i>

1223
01:37:27,917 --> 01:37:31,614
永远都是
<i>"Now and forever</i>

1224
01:37:31,687 --> 01:37:38,456
圣诞节
<i>"Christmas Day"</i>
