1
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:44,979
How's it going?

2
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:47,699
Been waiting long, handsome?

3
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:49,413
Why even ask?

4
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:50,979
We said we'd meet so l had to wait...

5
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:52,376
Let's go

6
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:54,018
Let's go

7
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:15,811
l know the big guys here...

8
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:18,460
So we got to camp out here
and watch the stars...

9
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:19,893
For the benefit of education

10
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:22,858
Get to lie here and watch the shower
of stars on Panomrueng...

11
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:27,138
Can't get any better than this...
Awesome!

12
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:28,933
What about food supply?

13
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:30,055
...Where's the food supply?

14
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:33,177
l prepared all the food supply we need...

15
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:35,490
Even you can't eat it all in
3 days and nights

16
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:37,059
That's great!

17
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:56,654
Help!

18
00:03:56,740 --> 00:04:01,530
Stop!...Move!...Move!

19
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:04,134
Hey!...Get up!

20
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:05,209
Are you okay Rong?

21
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:09,972
Stop!...l said, stop!

22
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:12,255
Help!

23
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:17,213
Freeze Mr.! This is the police!

24
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:19,697
Take it easy, Mr.

25
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:21,698
Take him away

26
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:33,617
Thank you for helping us catch the worker
that escaped from the center, inslpector

27
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:59,859
l heard villagers say you're doing
something crazy...

28
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:01,214
So, l came to see

29
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:04,258
What's it to anybody
what ritual l perform

30
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:06,615
Just don't do anything too crazy

31
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:10,450
l received warning
from the dark spirit world...

32
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:15,337
From this night evil spirits
are coming down

33
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:18,216
There'll be deaths!

34
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:29,778
Hurry it up, man...
We won't catch it in time

35
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:34,731
l know damn it!...

36
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:36,492
Stop rushing...

37
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:38,536
Can't get it right....

38
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:43,132
Wait! Gotta set the stand.

39
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:46,689
Look over there!....

40
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:48,179
lt's clearer...

41
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:49,529
Hurry!

42
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:54,499
Hey! Shooting star!

43
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:57,538
lt dropped there in
the ancient stone castle

44
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:02,419
What the hell is that noise!

45
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:06,293
What's that noise...

46
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:07,972
Hard to tell...

47
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:10,972
We'll know what happened
tomorrow morning.

48
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:13,694
Hey! l caught the shooting star on film

49
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:15,657
Really?

50
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:17,219
Where?

51
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:20,055
lnspector sir,

52
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:23,530
villagers claim they saw a fireball
fall into the valley at midnight

53
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:28,975
We'll head out tomorrow morning
and find out what happened

54
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:33,688
The villagers here believe ancient tale...

55
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:42,017
That dark spirits are buried under
the castle waiting to be awaken by a fireball

56
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:46,218
And their belief is more frightening
than a shooting star, inspector.

57
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:01,653
Hey! That's the crazy guy
from yesterday.

58
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:03,219
What happened?

59
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:04,619
Move back, Sak.

60
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:06,049
Be careful, Doc.

61
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:18,009
At about 10-1 1 pm.

62
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:20,534
We heard a loud cry coming
from the research center

63
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:23,300
There were lights flashing
from flashlights...

64
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:24,893
Don't know what they're looking for

65
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:30,293
Then at about 2 am.
shower of stars fell here in the valley

66
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:37,454
Last night 2 people were
murdered down there

67
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:43,134
So, altogether there were 3 deaths

68
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:49,173
Ghost!

69
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:51,854
All the bodies were murdered
in a similar way...

70
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:59,529
l'll have to ask you all to come down
to the station for further questioning

71
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:02,416
Glad to, inspector.

72
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:06,898
But weren't we supposed to be
heading back to Bangkok today?

73
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:09,813
Awe... Just come on.

74
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:11,774
Okay then...

75
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:14,454
We'll pack up and get changed.

76
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:21,092
Didn't think Pichit was going
to question us for 4 hours...

77
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:23,930
The station was filled with villagers...

78
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:25,499
Don't know what really happened

79
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:27,614
Just think about it...

80
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:30,772
We all heard that strange noise
from the woods...

81
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:35,213
Then that fireball happens
to fall near the stone castle...

82
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:37,291
And remember what the inspector said...

83
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:40,656
3 bodies were murdered in a similar way...

84
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:44,574
lf it was you,
wouldn't you want to know?

85
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:47,049
lf l didn't,
would l be sitting here, Doc?

86
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:48,812
l have to go call in absent from work...

87
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:51,778
Then we'll see what we'll do next

88
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:53,930
lf we all decide to stay...

89
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:56,215
l'll find us a place

90
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:07,699
Mr. Paew tried to escape twice...

91
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:12,171
Dr. do you think if Paew hadn't
escaped from the research center...

92
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:14,854
He might not have been killed?

93
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:19,929
The Dr. already explained it all...

94
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:23,137
Why do you keep asking
it over again, huh!

95
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:24,653
Chote!...

96
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:28,449
l must apologize for his lack of manners...

97
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:30,929
He must be stressed
from the work at the research center.

98
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:32,738
What kind of research is it?

99
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:36,173
That your worker totally lost his mind...

100
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:47,612
Sign here Dr. to certify your statement

101
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:20,136
Black scorpion to cobra 1 ,

102
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:22,777
Black scorpion to cobra 1 ...

103
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:27,134
Search team have now reached
target location...

104
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:29,780
Area surveyed no sign of alien form...

105
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:31,930
Moving in to clear area...

106
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:33,135
Repeat!...

107
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:35,097
Moving in to clear area.

108
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:42,653
Alright then!...

109
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:51,216
Since all of you are so afraid
of staying l'll help you out...

110
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:58,569
Take this charm
and place it in your home

111
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:21,658
ls there another problem again, Dr.?

112
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:24,731
Don't antagonize me!

113
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:27,050
You think you're the biggest
share holder in here?...

114
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:30,416
Don't forget that it was Dr. Willasinee
and l who set up this center

115
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,775
So, is there a problem or not?

116
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:35,335
lt's the same problem over again

117
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:38,375
Will you let Dr. Mun speak...

118
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:44,418
3 of our workers escaped
and was killed...

119
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:45,615
The police are investigating..

120
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:47,611
They're becoming suspicious
of our center

121
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:49,019
How many workers do we have?

122
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:53,219
There was 75, now there's 62...

123
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:55,575
3 dead and 4 went insane

124
00:12:56,100 --> 00:13:00,298
They were infected causing
them to have hallucinations...

125
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:04,857
We must use nerve stimulant
drug on the workers also

126
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:32,498
Excuse me, l'd like to ask you
something...

127
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:33,854
Where are all the villagers?...

128
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:35,259
Why is it so quiet here?

129
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:39,449
Villagers are afraid the spirits
will kill them...

130
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:43,897
Didn't you notice the charms
on doors and windows?

131
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,377
Some of them moved away

132
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:49,777
Are they so afraid of ghosts here?

133
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:52,249
lt's the fireball that came down
the night before...

134
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:55,093
Spirits will take revenge on the villagers

135
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:59,613
l'd like to know who put this
crazy idea in their heads

136
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:07,489
l've read the autopsy reports...

137
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:09,093
lt's unbelievable

138
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:11,296
lt gave me quite a head spin too,
inspector.

139
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:15,490
Looking from the flesh wounds...

140
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:18,140
lt's similar to what a tiger
would do to it's prey...

141
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:21,257
Or by a huge bear...

142
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:26,619
But there's no sign of animal
skin tissue on the wounds...

143
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:32,455
Just the one's of another human being

144
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:35,612
So what the hell can it be, inspector?

145
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:42,051
There's ancient stone castles scattered
all around the Thai-Cambodian border

146
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:46,292
Last night we saw the fireball
drop south of the castle...

147
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:48,450
Then it should be right about here...

148
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:49,529
Where the meteor landed

149
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:52,054
Yep, should be this way.

150
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:08,571
Damn! Fucking unbelievable!

151
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:11,732
What are the soldiers doing in here?

152
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:14,330
Hey, l think we should get
a closer look...

153
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:15,819
l want to see it better

154
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:17,932
Are you insane!

155
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:20,773
Soldiers with guns standing
everywhere!

156
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:24,937
Freeze! Stay where you are!

157
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:37,609
Dad! What are you doing here?

158
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:40,258
l should be asking you.

159
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:42,774
So what actually happened here, Dad?

160
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:50,572
lt's not any of your business...

161
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:52,378
lt's top secret

162
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:56,938
l never knew the army
was interested in meteors

163
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:02,289
How do you know it was a meteor?

164
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:05,372
l caught the fireball dropping
down on VDO, sir

165
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:06,051
Really?

166
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:10,213
Yes, Dad...Rong caught
the fireball on his VDO camera

167
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:12,609
Sir, we should confiscate the tape

168
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:13,655
lt's my tape...

169
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:15,298
You have no right to take it, General

170
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:20,654
Dad you're not really thinking
of taking Rong's tape, right?

171
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:28,896
No, we just want to watch
and draft it for further data research

172
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:30,333
l'll tell you what, sir...

173
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:35,494
l'll draft a set for you
when l get back to my place

174
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:45,897
Can't believe that anything
would survive out of this heat

175
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:49,131
Many villagers have already
been murdered, sir

176
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:53,612
You're thinking our
world is being invaded by aliens?

177
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:57,939
l don't believe it...

178
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:02,091
But there have been many
related incidents...

179
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:05,296
We must quickly find out the truth

180
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:11,412
Order your men to expand
their search to all premises...

181
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:14,856
To cover every area...

182
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:17,932
And let no one know what we're doing

183
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:33,093
There are 3 urgent orders from America,

184
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:41,178
France and Blue Nai
to be delivered in 24 hours

185
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:49,053
My father would like me to help out
with Mr. Mek's psychological profile...

186
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:52,018
l hope you've already received
contact accordingly

187
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:56,013
l've just received the documents
and contact from General Naris

188
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:57,374
We have no problems

189
00:17:57,460 --> 00:17:58,654
Thank you very much

190
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:01,618
l hope this high technology equipment

191
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:04,578
from the special unit will help us
find out more

192
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:09,609
l'll report to you us soon as
l find out anything new...

193
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:13,451
lf there's nothing else, then l'll be going

194
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:21,298
l'll be going also

195
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:47,813
My name's Narisara

196
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:49,538
l'm a physician...

197
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:52,050
l'm here to help you...

198
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:55,018
Can you tell me who killed Mr. Mook?

199
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:55,976
lt was a ghost...

200
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:57,413
lt's going to kill everyone it sees

201
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:01,413
Mr. Mek, please take it easy,
let's be sensible....

202
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:05,095
lf you don't explain it to me
l can't help you

203
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:07,011
lt's just like what Yaithong had said...

204
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:09,489
They were like the aliens
l've seen in the movies

205
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:10,774
Let's be sensible here, Mr. Mek

206
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:12,134
They're thousands of years old

207
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:13,653
Mek, look at me...

208
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:15,332
Look at me, Mek

209
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:16,296
l'm so afraid

210
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:18,052
We're all trying to help you here

211
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:19,255
Don't come any closer

212
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:20,898
Who killed Mr. Mook?

213
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:24,859
Frightening! They're going to kill me...

214
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:25,736
Ghost!

215
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:27,776
No! Don't come any closer!

216
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:29,498
Help me!

217
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:35,374
Mek, take it easy.... Mek

218
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:37,130
Get the fuck away from me!

219
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:39,892
Leave me alone!

220
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:41,333
Mek, no!...

221
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:43,615
Put down the gun, Mek...

222
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:13,656
Dad, l think it would be the right
thing to do....

223
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:17,779
lf we sent his body
for an autopsy as soon as possible

224
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:22,170
No one suspects or doubts
anyone here Dr.

225
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:09,696
What's your hurry, beautiful?

226
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:12,176
What are you 2 doing here?

227
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:16,419
Kiew!

228
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:18,212
You bastard! What are you going to do!

229
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:19,653
l just want to be your man

230
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:21,776
You animal!
Get the fuck away from me!

231
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:23,339
Leave me alone! Get away from me!

232
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:26,253
Help! You bastard!

233
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:26,897
Let me go!

234
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:28,936
Both of you go keep a look out

235
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:30,770
Go!

236
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:32,771
No! Let go of me!

237
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:35,688
You bastard! Let go of me!

238
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:38,931
You son of a bitch!

239
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:00,331
Hey, what the hell is that?

240
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:02,536
Help!

241
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:43,091
How is it that your people
were murdered in these woods, Chief?

242
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:45,250
lt's like this...

243
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:51,290
My son and his 2 men went around
the village for a safety check...

244
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:54,770
When they got to the stream they saw
a strange creature dragging Mayom

245
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:56,691
into the woods...

246
00:22:56,780 --> 00:23:02,298
They went to help
and that's when it killed those 2...

247
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:04,814
lt's a good thing that my son escaped

248
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:09,611
ls what the Chief just said true?

249
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:12,016
Yes it is, inspector

250
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:16,809
Are you sure you saw
this creature take Mayom?

251
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:19,252
What ever the hell it is...

252
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:21,490
We must find it...

253
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:23,093
Right now we have Gen.

254
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:25,614
Louis and inspector Pichit's men
out hunting it down

255
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:40,335
Mayom!

256
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:48,657
Mayom!

257
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:37,458
The body looks as though
it was hit by a grenade...

258
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:38,734
But it wasn't

259
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:40,811
Looks more like it was torn apart...

260
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:44,654
l notice the traces of nail scratches
and bite marks all over sir

261
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:47,732
What can tear human flesh
up like this?

262
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:53,569
Clear

263
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:59,012
Calling Panomrueng from Pichit 1 ...

264
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:01,771
Can't contact anyone, inspector...

265
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:03,259
The radio must be down

266
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:05,294
Try changing positions

267
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:07,211
l've changed so many that
my balls hurt

268
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:09,814
This means we'll have to go down
empty handed...

269
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:12,375
Wonder how the bait is doing

270
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:21,935
Hey, Sarge....

271
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:23,055
What is it?

272
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:25,700
Our radio can't get contact...

273
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:27,816
Does it have anything to do
with alien frequency?

274
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:34,134
Why don't you try tuning to their
channel and request a song

275
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:39,256
You want to listen to alien songs...

276
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:41,134
What?

277
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:42,335
How'd you come up with that?

278
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:10,215
Clear!

279
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:46,209
l've just received report...

280
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:51,055
9 officials from the research center
heading towards the mountain range...

281
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:53,051
They look suspicious

282
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:58,817
They know that's a dangerous zone...

283
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:00,777
And they still insist on going

284
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:03,772
lf that's the case...

285
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:06,613
Then l'll have to take the men back up

286
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:08,778
We'll come too, inspector

287
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:11,692
Don't you want to get some rest?

288
00:28:11,780 --> 00:28:13,133
We don't see you resting, inspector....

289
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:15,017
So, how can we?

290
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:52,332
lt's the village girl that was kidnapped

291
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:54,695
She's still alive...

292
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:56,179
But her pulse is very weak

293
00:29:56,460 --> 00:29:58,655
Regain her consciousness as fast
as you can, Sgt. Nop

294
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:10,098
Sir, l see a whole police unit
entering into the woods

295
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:12,410
Where are they?

296
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:14,172
They're headed towards the cliff...

297
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:16,216
They're about a kilometer away
from us.

298
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:19,653
That means they cut short
ahead of us

299
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:38,053
Sir, what she says makes no sense

300
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:39,853
We have no choice...

301
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:42,329
We must take her back to the village...

302
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:44,729
Use the short cut

303
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:46,458
Yes, sir.

304
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:22,378
Where did that gun shot come from?

305
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:23,888
lt came from over there, inspector

306
00:31:25,060 --> 00:31:26,288
What's going on, inspector?

307
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:28,609
l don't know yet

308
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:31,608
Fahreng, Doc...Don't come out yet

309
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:35,098
Hey, what's happening?

310
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:38,929
Who's there?

311
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:41,735
lt's me, Dr. Mun

312
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:45,252
Who shot off their gun just now?

313
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:47,019
lt was one of us

314
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:00,536
What were you shooting at?

315
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:03,689
l saw about 3-4 of those strange
creatures in the bushes...

316
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:05,293
Looked like they were going
to attack us...

317
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:07,655
So, l had my men shoot at it.

318
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:09,977
Strange creatures?

319
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:12,136
There aren't any of those
around here, Dr.

320
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:18,129
l said they were strange creatures
because they aren't human...

321
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:21,970
But if you don't believe me,
l'll show it to you

322
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:28,373
Shouldn't have gotten away
bleeding this much

323
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:32,371
lf we hadn't come in time
you'd all be dead

324
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:35,253
You wouldn't have been able
to take them on

325
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:37,928
How do you know?

326
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:39,658
We all have guns here

327
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:46,214
What are you and the Dr.
doing in these woods?

328
00:32:48,180 --> 00:32:52,458
We were hunting those creatures
that dropped down with the space ship

329
00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:55,771
And this space ship...

330
00:32:55,860 --> 00:32:58,420
Where and when did it drop down?

331
00:32:59,420 --> 00:33:01,854
That same night we had
that shower of stars....

332
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:06,810
l saw it all happen because it
was close to the center

333
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:08,329
The same place that...

334
00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:14,175
Yes, on the same location task
force have seized control over

335
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:17,531
l think only someone stupid
would believe that

336
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:22,537
When l saw that fireball drop
from the sky....

337
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:24,895
l knew it wasn't a meteor...

338
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:30,498
So, l quickly took my men to the site...

339
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:36,337
We got there in time to see them
struggling out of their wreckage...

340
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:38,615
Then they quickly disappeared
into the woods

341
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:42,691
So, what happened to the
remains of the ship?

342
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:47,657
The task force came with
large containers to transport it out...

343
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:49,651
They set up special security
to guard the premise...

344
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:51,696
No one can get through

345
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:58,534
Do they know about your alien
creature or these unhuman, Dr.?

346
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:00,212
What do you think, inspector?

347
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:02,495
l sure don't believe any of it.

348
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:07,416
Either l believe it or not that's
another story...

349
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:11,857
But right now l have to
confiscate all your weapons

350
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:19,134
l'm sorry l cannot grant your
request, inspector...

351
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:22,417
This is a matter of life and death...

352
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:24,855
And l must defend for my own life

353
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:35,375
Chief...

354
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:43,099
Where have you been?

355
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:45,055
What's going on?

356
00:34:45,180 --> 00:34:47,091
Mayom is back, Chief

357
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:48,816
Really?

358
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:50,174
Yes, ma'am...

359
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:51,773
Came back early this morning...

360
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:54,090
The soldiers went searching
for her in the woods...

361
00:34:54,180 --> 00:34:56,216
When they found her,
they brought her back here

362
00:34:57,460 --> 00:34:58,893
Didn't she die like the rest?

363
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:00,891
How should l know, Chief...

364
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:02,971
Both of us just came to report
the news...

365
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:05,130
We told you what we heard...

366
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:07,336
But they say she's gone mad

367
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:22,939
Still warm

368
00:35:26,540 --> 00:35:28,735
Remains of a living thing
was burned here

369
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:32,059
lt's the alien we shot...

370
00:35:32,140 --> 00:35:35,337
The one leaving traces of blood
we've been following...

371
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:38,537
lt probably didn't survive so the others
destroyed any trace of evidence

372
00:35:38,620 --> 00:35:42,374
l want everyone to spread out
and search this area..

373
00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:46,570
We'll use this fire heap here as
a center point...

374
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:49,413
l believe that we'll find something

375
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:23,974
This way! They should be around here...

376
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:24,890
Watch yourselves

377
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:41,576
Snake!

378
00:36:44,260 --> 00:36:46,057
Doc!

379
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:56,258
Narisara!

380
00:36:56,340 --> 00:36:57,329
Doc!

381
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:29,614
Narisara!

382
00:37:56,820 --> 00:37:58,014
Narisara!

383
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:01,379
Narisara!

384
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:30,411
Are you alright Doctor?

385
00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:38,618
Doc....Narisara...

386
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:41,692
Doc....

387
00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:50,535
Thank you for saving my friend,
inspector

388
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:16,372
l'll chop you up into pieces!

389
00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:17,688
Creatures from hell!

390
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:19,691
We must quickly kill all of them...

391
00:39:19,780 --> 00:39:21,498
Before they start to breed
and conquer the world

392
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:26,171
ln the end those foul mouths
are all dead...

393
00:39:27,260 --> 00:39:31,617
And the leftovers come crawling
for me to help

394
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:34,930
What are you babbling about?

395
00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:41,255
l really want to know
what an old hag like you knows

396
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:51,174
l do know what evil you've done
to that Mayom girl!

397
00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:07,052
Why the quick burial?

398
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:09,415
You should let me first see the body

399
00:40:10,180 --> 00:40:13,058
l think all of you should leave
these woods...

400
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:16,132
And let us settle this revenge
with them one on one

401
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:18,257
An explosion!

402
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:19,739
What happened?

403
00:40:19,940 --> 00:40:21,259
We got them!

404
00:40:21,340 --> 00:40:24,059
Wait...What do you mean?

405
00:40:24,140 --> 00:40:24,970
Chote!

406
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:26,698
Go!

407
00:40:32,660 --> 00:40:35,174
Private Tueng...

408
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:39,570
Back away! Move! Let me...

409
00:40:39,660 --> 00:40:41,491
l'll help you, Doc

410
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:44,048
Stuff the intestines back in...Hurry!

411
00:40:44,140 --> 00:40:45,129
Careful there, Doc

412
00:40:45,220 --> 00:40:47,131
How you holding up there, Dabtang?

413
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:49,370
Private Tueng and l went looking
for those 3

414
00:40:49,460 --> 00:40:51,371
They were setting up mine traps...

415
00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:53,052
Tueng started running...

416
00:40:53,140 --> 00:40:55,051
Teung...

417
00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:56,937
What a pity...

418
00:40:57,020 --> 00:40:59,090
Private Tueng!

419
00:40:59,180 --> 00:41:01,057
Tueng!

420
00:41:01,820 --> 00:41:03,856
What's wrong with him, Doc?

421
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:08,412
You had your men set these
traps up, right Dr.?

422
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:10,058
You let me go this instant, inspector....

423
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:14,531
lt has killed villagers, people,
most of my men

424
00:41:14,620 --> 00:41:17,851
We'd all be dead if we waited
for you, inspector

425
00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:20,090
So good with that mouth of yours!

426
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:28,173
You are under arrest for possession
of war weapons

427
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:36,537
l received an urgent call
from the North unit...

428
00:41:36,620 --> 00:41:42,331
They have requisition for the release
of Dr. Mun with no charges filed

429
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:48,537
Don't know if Dr. Mun claimed
he was hunting aliens...

430
00:41:48,620 --> 00:41:49,894
What's this all about?

431
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:56,328
He says he reached the area where
the fireball struck before the task force...

432
00:41:56,420 --> 00:41:58,615
That's not possible

433
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:03,452
Dad, can't we hold him for
questioning?

434
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:05,658
l wish we could

435
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:12,658
You've failed terribly, Dr...

436
00:42:12,740 --> 00:42:14,458
lt was almost over for you

437
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:16,890
Don't talk to me that way...

438
00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:18,777
You've done nothing to make it easier

439
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:22,734
The head board was displeased
about your failure, Dr....

440
00:42:22,820 --> 00:42:25,288
Nobody trusts us at this point...

441
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:27,610
Nobody wants to take the risk
with our project anymore...

442
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:31,693
l had to persuade everyone
that they can rely on you...

443
00:42:32,780 --> 00:42:36,898
The board then agreed to resolve
your little dispute

444
00:42:39,180 --> 00:42:40,977
lf this is about repayment
for your favors then...

445
00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:42,413
Go right ahead!

446
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:46,334
lf l go down,
l'll tell them the whole truth...

447
00:42:46,420 --> 00:42:48,615
l'll expose everything!

448
00:43:05,860 --> 00:43:09,739
Don't think you'll succeed
without me along

449
00:43:09,940 --> 00:43:11,612
Just hurry it up...

450
00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:13,418
We have important work to do

451
00:43:14,020 --> 00:43:17,137
Hunting down alien life forms...

452
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:19,017
Good one!

453
00:43:19,780 --> 00:43:20,974
Don't waste my time...

454
00:43:21,060 --> 00:43:23,494
You agreed to help me get rid of them

455
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:30,976
Gen. Naris says by law it's illegal
to search the center

456
00:43:31,060 --> 00:43:35,372
But we can search it outside
of the law

457
00:43:35,460 --> 00:43:36,654
Correct!

458
00:43:36,740 --> 00:43:38,014
But if something goes wrong...

459
00:43:38,100 --> 00:43:40,136
We'll be in deep shit, inspector

460
00:43:42,180 --> 00:43:43,932
l'd like to take on this task...

461
00:43:44,020 --> 00:43:48,775
l ask for one person who knows
ecology to come with me

462
00:43:52,740 --> 00:43:54,492
Through their DNA...

463
00:43:54,580 --> 00:43:58,289
They must be either near a stream
or anywhere humid

464
00:43:58,660 --> 00:44:00,776
The thing l'm most sure about is...

465
00:44:00,860 --> 00:44:02,896
They have strong sexual hormones...

466
00:44:02,980 --> 00:44:06,859
More deranged sexual desires
than any ordinary human

467
00:44:11,780 --> 00:44:17,776
Part of that was composed through
the fermentation of your DNA

468
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:20,856
From both of ours

469
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:24,092
Here they come, Dr.

470
00:47:05,260 --> 00:47:06,932
You don't have to squeeze so tight

471
00:47:07,020 --> 00:47:09,773
l was afraid you'd make a noise

472
00:47:09,980 --> 00:47:11,811
l know what l have to do...

473
00:47:11,900 --> 00:47:13,299
Let go

474
00:47:13,900 --> 00:47:15,379
Follow me

475
00:47:46,380 --> 00:47:49,053
What is this?

476
00:48:06,580 --> 00:48:10,368
l'd never believe it if l didn't see it...

477
00:48:26,740 --> 00:48:28,139
Pichit!

478
00:48:49,620 --> 00:48:51,850
What l want to know is what the
2 of you want?

479
00:48:51,940 --> 00:48:53,293
First, let us go...

480
00:48:53,380 --> 00:48:55,257
You have no right to do this to us

481
00:48:55,860 --> 00:48:58,215
Now why should we let you go, Dr.?

482
00:48:59,220 --> 00:49:03,293
l want to know what you have
locked up here...

483
00:49:03,380 --> 00:49:06,611
So this is your alien

484
00:49:07,780 --> 00:49:11,534
My guess is you're cloning
a new breed of humans...

485
00:49:11,620 --> 00:49:13,895
By taking animal DNA injecting
it to clash both breeds...

486
00:49:13,980 --> 00:49:16,540
What you're doing is illegal

487
00:49:18,660 --> 00:49:20,252
You have no idea...

488
00:49:20,340 --> 00:49:24,458
How much we can benefit
from this research

489
00:49:25,540 --> 00:49:28,338
What you're doing has to be illegal...

490
00:49:28,420 --> 00:49:33,653
Or else you wouldn't cover
up this center

491
00:49:34,580 --> 00:49:36,571
Don't get too smart inspector...

492
00:49:36,660 --> 00:49:38,218
What would you know?

493
00:49:38,580 --> 00:49:41,697
You shouldn't interfere
with anything we do

494
00:49:41,780 --> 00:49:43,293
But this is immoral...

495
00:49:43,380 --> 00:49:45,530
You're breaking the laws of nature...

496
00:49:45,620 --> 00:49:47,611
lt's injustice towards medical science...

497
00:49:47,700 --> 00:49:51,659
Most important you're challenging God

498
00:50:19,100 --> 00:50:23,252
Police and army officials are
asking to search the center

499
00:50:25,100 --> 00:50:27,056
What's happening here...

500
00:50:27,140 --> 00:50:29,734
There are enough problems as it is

501
00:50:33,060 --> 00:50:34,095
Hold them off as long as you can...

502
00:50:34,180 --> 00:50:35,852
Wait until l finish setting
things up in here

503
00:50:35,940 --> 00:50:37,259
Yes, sir.

504
00:50:39,100 --> 00:50:41,614
2 of our people entered inside
the center...

505
00:50:41,700 --> 00:50:42,655
And they haven't been seen since...

506
00:50:42,740 --> 00:50:45,777
l'm afraid they could be in danger

507
00:50:45,860 --> 00:50:48,454
Your people trespassed into our area...

508
00:50:48,540 --> 00:50:50,053
And you have the never to accuse us...

509
00:50:50,140 --> 00:50:51,698
You're either stupid or crazy

510
00:50:51,780 --> 00:50:54,374
Alright, take it easy Dr. Willasinee...

511
00:50:54,460 --> 00:50:56,849
Since you're already here...

512
00:50:56,940 --> 00:50:58,931
To clear any suspicion you might have...

513
00:50:59,020 --> 00:51:03,218
We'll guide you all through the center

514
00:51:28,380 --> 00:51:30,052
l have no more doubts

515
00:51:30,140 --> 00:51:34,338
You sure you don't
want to see the rest of our center?

516
00:51:34,780 --> 00:51:36,259
Yes

517
00:51:48,780 --> 00:51:52,978
Eat... l wouldn't want you to
die for nothing

518
00:51:55,340 --> 00:51:57,171
Why are you cloning humans?

519
00:51:57,260 --> 00:51:59,490
You know that it's illegal

520
00:52:00,220 --> 00:52:02,211
There aren't really any aliens...

521
00:52:02,300 --> 00:52:07,090
You're hunting for unhuman
that escaped out of here

522
00:52:07,180 --> 00:52:08,977
You seem to know a lot, inspector...

523
00:52:10,380 --> 00:52:13,372
The more you know the faster
you both will die

524
00:52:15,900 --> 00:52:17,731
Where is everybody?

525
00:52:17,820 --> 00:52:20,493
Why are they making so much
commotion?

526
00:52:21,900 --> 00:52:23,891
Why aren't they drugged?

527
00:52:23,980 --> 00:52:25,413
Hurry Dr...

528
00:52:25,500 --> 00:52:27,218
They're getting out of control

529
00:52:28,700 --> 00:52:30,418
You fools!

530
00:52:30,500 --> 00:52:31,649
Lock the room

531
00:52:47,100 --> 00:52:48,055
What happened?

532
00:52:48,140 --> 00:52:51,018
We were taking her to surgery
for these customer orders...

533
00:52:51,100 --> 00:52:53,295
But this bitch really had a tantrum

534
00:52:54,020 --> 00:52:55,976
Where are all of our workers?

535
00:52:56,060 --> 00:52:59,018
How many times
will they repeat these mistakes?

536
00:52:59,100 --> 00:53:01,330
We've lost a lost of workers...

537
00:53:01,420 --> 00:53:03,058
Some just back from their mission

538
00:53:03,140 --> 00:53:04,459
This is just perfect!

539
00:53:04,540 --> 00:53:06,451
Someday l'll have robots instead of you

540
00:53:12,740 --> 00:53:13,855
Why aren't they sedated?

541
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:15,055
We have no time...

542
00:53:15,140 --> 00:53:16,459
We have urgent orders that came in...

543
00:53:16,540 --> 00:53:18,053
We must make deliveries immediately

544
00:53:18,140 --> 00:53:19,255
Keep it alive...

545
00:53:19,340 --> 00:53:22,059
We need the organs

546
00:53:24,740 --> 00:53:26,059
Take care of things here...

547
00:53:26,140 --> 00:53:27,971
l'll handle them myself

548
00:53:39,580 --> 00:53:40,649
This way

549
00:53:54,060 --> 00:53:54,970
Use the electric shock

550
00:53:55,060 --> 00:53:56,891
We have...But it doesn't work

551
00:53:56,980 --> 00:53:58,015
Shoot the anesthetic

552
00:53:58,100 --> 00:53:59,453
There aren't any left

553
00:54:10,740 --> 00:54:11,934
Stop right now!

554
00:54:12,020 --> 00:54:13,009
You can't use poisonous gas...

555
00:54:13,100 --> 00:54:14,453
lt'll danger the young ones

556
00:54:14,540 --> 00:54:16,735
lf we don't use gas no way
can we stop them

557
00:54:16,820 --> 00:54:19,050
Poisonous gas will spread
throughout this center...

558
00:54:19,140 --> 00:54:21,415
We have many young ones in fertilization

559
00:54:21,500 --> 00:54:23,456
They won't survive no matter what

560
00:54:23,540 --> 00:54:25,417
You're always hesitating...

561
00:54:25,500 --> 00:54:28,219
That's how many of them were
able to escape

562
00:54:51,460 --> 00:54:54,816
l don't understand why these
guns can't stop them

563
00:54:55,900 --> 00:54:59,779
Because we increased the chemicals
to speed up cell construction

564
00:56:16,540 --> 00:56:18,974
Come on, hurry!

565
00:57:23,260 --> 00:57:24,329
Destroy everything...

566
00:57:24,420 --> 00:57:26,331
Don't leave any traces behind
for them to find...

567
00:57:26,420 --> 00:57:29,059
lt's because of that Leonic
star shower...

568
00:57:29,140 --> 00:57:31,495
All these damn problems
started happening

569
00:57:31,900 --> 00:57:33,219
Go!

570
00:59:23,500 --> 00:59:28,574
l just received a letter from
lnternal Security

571
00:59:29,100 --> 00:59:33,412
NASA analyzed the remains
of the wrecked ship...

572
00:59:33,500 --> 00:59:37,095
They confirm it to be remains
from a ship...

573
00:59:37,180 --> 00:59:44,291
Not an alien ship but an old
space satellite Firefox...

574
00:59:44,380 --> 00:59:45,893
lt's space garbage...

575
00:59:45,980 --> 00:59:48,699
lt was struck down by a group
of meteors...

576
00:59:48,780 --> 00:59:53,251
The same night there
was the shower of stars...

577
00:59:53,340 --> 00:59:55,251
lt's possible but chances are
1 in a million

578
00:59:55,340 --> 01:00:00,937
So, it's clear there aren't
any aliens or space ship right?

579
01:00:01,020 --> 01:00:03,409
Or is it like what Dr. Mun had said

580
01:00:03,500 --> 01:00:08,449
So, it's possible that Yaithong's
legend might be true?

581
01:00:15,540 --> 01:00:17,337
But Yaithong knows our secret...

582
01:00:17,420 --> 01:00:20,139
And you know her mouth

583
01:00:20,220 --> 01:00:25,658
l'm planning for villagers to
run her out

584
01:00:25,740 --> 01:00:30,575
l knew you were going
to play dirty, Chief

585
01:01:34,300 --> 01:01:36,370
l think this place will be safe enough...

586
01:01:36,460 --> 01:01:39,213
l'll go back to report everything
that happened

587
01:01:39,420 --> 01:01:40,455
Pichit...

588
01:01:40,540 --> 01:01:45,216
How can we be sure it's safe
for them to wait here...

589
01:01:45,300 --> 01:01:47,131
What if someone sees them...

590
01:01:47,220 --> 01:01:48,778
lt's dangerous

591
01:01:48,980 --> 01:01:50,971
Don't worry about us...

592
01:01:51,060 --> 01:01:55,417
Can't be worse than what
we must face

593
01:01:56,900 --> 01:02:00,210
Then the 2 of you wait for us here

594
01:02:09,780 --> 01:02:13,375
Distance of about 500 meters
from basement to research center

595
01:02:13,460 --> 01:02:15,496
Leading back up to the woods

596
01:02:16,340 --> 01:02:19,138
Barely enough air here to breathe...

597
01:02:19,220 --> 01:02:20,778
Very congested

598
01:02:22,420 --> 01:02:23,614
Sir...

599
01:02:23,700 --> 01:02:25,577
What's wrong?

600
01:02:26,420 --> 01:02:27,455
He's ice cold...

601
01:02:27,540 --> 01:02:28,814
He's turning pale...

602
01:02:28,900 --> 01:02:30,094
He didn't just faint...

603
01:02:30,180 --> 01:02:33,217
He has a heart condition...

604
01:02:33,300 --> 01:02:35,495
Take him to the hospital immediately

605
01:03:11,540 --> 01:03:14,054
l don't know where they are right now...

606
01:03:15,860 --> 01:03:19,330
No traces found to confirm
that they're dead

607
01:03:21,300 --> 01:03:24,053
And now her father is ill

608
01:03:35,340 --> 01:03:36,568
They've seen us....

609
01:04:03,740 --> 01:04:05,298
This way!

610
01:05:24,900 --> 01:05:25,855
What?

611
01:05:25,940 --> 01:05:28,773
How can anyone do
something this evil?

612
01:05:30,660 --> 01:05:33,493
They clone humans then kill them...

613
01:05:34,180 --> 01:05:38,776
Take out their organs
and sell it to rich people

614
01:05:39,860 --> 01:05:42,249
They kill one life to extend
another life...

615
01:05:42,340 --> 01:05:44,058
That's damn despicable

616
01:05:47,860 --> 01:05:51,739
Don't know how far off they are now

617
01:05:59,380 --> 01:06:00,608
lnspector Pichit...

618
01:06:00,700 --> 01:06:03,009
lnspector already left...

619
01:06:03,100 --> 01:06:08,493
He come a few times to visit
while you were unconscious

620
01:06:12,460 --> 01:06:14,018
How about my father...

621
01:06:14,780 --> 01:06:17,010
Does he know l'm here?

622
01:06:26,220 --> 01:06:28,051
Since you asked

623
01:06:28,140 --> 01:06:29,937
What is it, Fahrueng?

624
01:06:33,100 --> 01:06:34,658
What's happened to my father?

625
01:06:35,980 --> 01:06:37,857
Alright, relax Doc....

626
01:06:39,100 --> 01:06:41,295
And listen to me carefully...

627
01:06:42,940 --> 01:06:47,218
Your father had a heart attack...

628
01:06:47,300 --> 01:06:51,088
Right now he's at the province hospital

629
01:06:52,180 --> 01:06:55,695
Quickly take me to see my father...

630
01:06:55,780 --> 01:06:56,735
Fahrueng...Sak

631
01:06:57,420 --> 01:06:59,536
Jack...Rong...

632
01:07:04,300 --> 01:07:06,177
Mom...

633
01:07:06,460 --> 01:07:09,691
Doctor says there's a problem
with his coronary...

634
01:07:11,100 --> 01:07:13,455
lf we don't transplant a false heart...

635
01:07:15,020 --> 01:07:17,853
Then we'll have to find a new
heart for him.

636
01:07:18,860 --> 01:07:24,890
Where are we going to find a heart?

637
01:07:26,460 --> 01:07:28,690
lf the doctors are willing...

638
01:07:28,780 --> 01:07:31,135
l'll sacrifice my own

639
01:07:33,820 --> 01:07:37,779
l'll be the one to sacrifice
my heart for your father

640
01:07:38,860 --> 01:07:40,737
Mom...

641
01:07:49,580 --> 01:07:56,497
Now l understand why
they were cloning humans

642
01:07:57,180 --> 01:08:01,537
To build up a human farm
and transfer organs

643
01:08:02,380 --> 01:08:04,940
But if we look at it again

644
01:08:05,020 --> 01:08:08,535
Think of the patients waiting
for a new organ

645
01:08:08,620 --> 01:08:14,695
Somehow makes what
they do right and reasonable

646
01:08:14,780 --> 01:08:17,169
l still disagree with it...

647
01:08:17,260 --> 01:08:19,854
Killing a life to extend another life

648
01:08:20,780 --> 01:08:26,173
What if we took a cloning heart
and changed it for your father

649
01:08:27,420 --> 01:08:31,732
Your father needs a new heart...

650
01:08:31,820 --> 01:08:38,692
lf we don't find one he could die

651
01:08:40,700 --> 01:08:44,852
l hope you're not thinking of
transplanting their heart into my father

652
01:08:46,620 --> 01:08:47,814
There were 2 of them...

653
01:08:47,900 --> 01:08:51,654
A woman and a man that Dr. Mun cloned

654
01:08:51,740 --> 01:08:54,300
They asked to hide out here
in the temple

655
01:08:54,380 --> 01:08:58,419
They were injured from fighting
their own kind

656
01:08:58,500 --> 01:09:01,412
On that same night waiting for you

657
01:09:02,020 --> 01:09:03,897
So you've seen them

658
01:09:04,100 --> 01:09:06,330
The ruthless breed found them

659
01:09:06,420 --> 01:09:09,139
They started battling one another...

660
01:09:09,220 --> 01:09:10,938
l was out receiving morning offerings

661
01:09:11,020 --> 01:09:13,329
Found them both at the entrance
to the temple

662
01:09:13,420 --> 01:09:15,251
So l took them into hiding

663
01:09:15,340 --> 01:09:17,251
Afraid that if other monks
or anyone else found them

664
01:09:17,340 --> 01:09:19,058
They might be in danger

665
01:09:19,260 --> 01:09:25,210
Would you know where
they were heading?

666
01:09:26,100 --> 01:09:29,410
They told me they wanted
to go far away...

667
01:09:29,500 --> 01:09:32,060
Where there aren't any people

668
01:09:32,140 --> 01:09:34,779
They're afraid the others
might find them...

669
01:09:34,860 --> 01:09:37,010
And the villagers will be in danger...

670
01:09:37,100 --> 01:09:38,533
They are of weak mind...

671
01:09:38,620 --> 01:09:42,010
Yaithong has them all under
her black spell

672
01:10:00,100 --> 01:10:00,896
Chief Toh...

673
01:10:00,980 --> 01:10:02,572
Tell the chief to come and talk to me

674
01:10:02,660 --> 01:10:05,174
Father is very ill...

675
01:10:05,260 --> 01:10:06,215
Can't get up

676
01:10:06,300 --> 01:10:10,657
lnspector told you to call your father...
Go tell him to come down

677
01:10:10,740 --> 01:10:12,458
What's the problem inspector?

678
01:10:12,540 --> 01:10:15,008
Have someone alert the villagers

679
01:10:15,100 --> 01:10:17,660
l just received word that this
village will be raided...

680
01:10:17,740 --> 01:10:20,459
Villagers will be robbed and killed

681
01:10:20,540 --> 01:10:22,053
Mother...

682
01:10:22,140 --> 01:10:23,971
Really, inspector?

683
01:10:24,060 --> 01:10:27,132
Do l look like l'm in the mood to joke?

684
01:10:49,900 --> 01:10:52,733
Careful!

685
01:10:53,100 --> 01:10:54,055
Hurry!

686
01:10:54,140 --> 01:10:57,052
We must help them anyway we can

687
01:11:01,980 --> 01:11:04,813
Hurry!

688
01:11:04,900 --> 01:11:10,691
Everyone take anything you might have

689
01:11:10,780 --> 01:11:14,568
Stack them up into a wall
and don't go out

690
01:11:18,580 --> 01:11:19,979
Mother!

691
01:11:38,100 --> 01:11:40,773
Hurry!

692
01:11:41,300 --> 01:11:44,019
Hurry!

693
01:11:49,180 --> 01:11:52,172
Get behind the wall!

694
01:11:53,500 --> 01:11:54,649
What the hell's going on?

695
01:12:32,900 --> 01:12:34,970
Hurry!

696
01:12:35,060 --> 01:12:37,654
Get in!

697
01:12:42,820 --> 01:12:45,971
Hurry!

698
01:13:29,740 --> 01:13:32,698
Father!

699
01:13:32,780 --> 01:13:35,214
Back away please

700
01:13:35,300 --> 01:13:37,495
Who did this?

701
01:14:28,460 --> 01:14:29,415
Range patrol unit reported in sir...

702
01:14:29,500 --> 01:14:30,979
lt's true...

703
01:14:31,060 --> 01:14:33,415
They're sneaking into hiding
with the border bandits

704
01:14:33,500 --> 01:14:34,899
They're still in Thai territory...

705
01:14:34,980 --> 01:14:36,811
300 meters away from the border

706
01:14:36,900 --> 01:14:37,650
Let's get them!

707
01:14:37,740 --> 01:14:39,059
Go!

708
01:14:45,740 --> 01:14:47,412
We must quickly get out of here...

709
01:14:47,500 --> 01:14:48,489
Cross over to the other side

710
01:14:48,580 --> 01:14:52,459
Their people will take care
and protect us there

711
01:14:53,460 --> 01:14:56,054
lsn't there a car or something
to pick us up?

712
01:14:56,140 --> 01:14:57,698
We've paid them a lot of money

713
01:14:57,780 --> 01:14:59,691
There should be more options than this

714
01:14:59,780 --> 01:15:03,011
The border is filled with land mines

715
01:15:03,100 --> 01:15:04,818
That won't be possible

716
01:15:13,740 --> 01:15:16,812
l never thought that
we'd be in this situation

717
01:15:16,900 --> 01:15:19,016
All because of that Leonic star shower...

718
01:15:19,100 --> 01:15:21,056
Made everything worse

719
01:15:22,700 --> 01:15:25,419
Stop blaming fate Dr.

720
01:15:25,500 --> 01:15:27,331
Are we just going to stay here

721
01:15:27,420 --> 01:15:30,492
Or go on to start fresh on bigger
project than this

722
01:15:33,180 --> 01:15:34,499
Hurry! lt's dangerous here!

723
01:15:34,580 --> 01:15:36,457
Anymore delay we won't
ensure your safety

724
01:15:38,420 --> 01:15:40,297
Hurry! What the hell!

725
01:15:50,260 --> 01:15:51,056
What's going on here?

726
01:15:51,980 --> 01:15:53,413
Our camp is under attack!

727
01:15:53,500 --> 01:15:55,695
Who's attacking us?

728
01:15:55,780 --> 01:15:56,656
Don't know...

729
01:16:36,580 --> 01:16:40,050
Gen. Louis task force tracked
us to the border

730
01:16:40,140 --> 01:16:42,529
When are they going
to get off my back! Bastards!

731
01:16:43,860 --> 01:16:45,418
Are you sure we can handle them...

732
01:16:45,500 --> 01:16:46,330
Don't worry...

733
01:16:46,420 --> 01:16:48,297
These bastards have a plan
to handle them

734
01:16:48,380 --> 01:16:49,893
Go!

735
01:17:59,100 --> 01:18:00,499
How's the General Dr.?

736
01:18:00,580 --> 01:18:02,059
He's still in coma...

737
01:18:02,140 --> 01:18:04,415
The bullet damaged his
internal organs

738
01:18:04,500 --> 01:18:06,411
Especially the liver...

739
01:18:06,500 --> 01:18:09,458
We've used all medical equipment
to prolong his life

740
01:18:09,540 --> 01:18:11,929
But right now his condition is 30-70

741
01:18:12,020 --> 01:18:14,659
lf in 12 hours his condition
becomes worse...

742
01:18:14,740 --> 01:18:17,300
We'll have to operate again

743
01:18:25,500 --> 01:18:26,057
Wait!

744
01:18:28,140 --> 01:18:29,732
l smell them...

745
01:18:54,820 --> 01:18:56,538
Why won't they die!

746
01:18:57,100 --> 01:19:00,456
There must be some kind of a chemical
change going through them

747
01:19:12,500 --> 01:19:14,058
Help!

748
01:20:09,980 --> 01:20:11,971
You've brought them here...

749
01:20:12,060 --> 01:20:14,779
Without following my command...

750
01:20:19,100 --> 01:20:22,456
So, these are the foreign doctors

751
01:20:25,220 --> 01:20:30,374
lf you hate them then why
not kill them...

752
01:20:47,740 --> 01:20:50,777
No!

753
01:20:54,260 --> 01:20:56,535
l'm going to kill you!

754
01:21:01,300 --> 01:21:04,212
Let me go right now!

755
01:21:04,620 --> 01:21:06,451
Evil fools!

756
01:21:06,540 --> 01:21:12,058
l didn't create you for this!

757
01:21:12,140 --> 01:21:14,335
That's your mother!

758
01:21:16,220 --> 01:21:18,097
No!

759
01:21:27,100 --> 01:21:35,053
Buddhist father says that besides
me his only other follower must be a virgin

760
01:21:44,620 --> 01:21:47,214
Sin!

761
01:21:47,300 --> 01:21:49,495
lt's inside you.

762
01:21:50,580 --> 01:21:52,855
Who are you old hag?

763
01:21:55,740 --> 01:21:59,130
l'm the one controlling your destiny

764
01:21:59,220 --> 01:22:03,054
You're a witch...an old witch Dr.

765
01:22:13,100 --> 01:22:14,852
You!

766
01:22:14,940 --> 01:22:18,694
You must create more of them for me

767
01:22:18,780 --> 01:22:23,058
l'll use my black magic to control them

768
01:22:55,500 --> 01:22:57,058
Stop!

769
01:22:57,700 --> 01:23:00,498
Don't kill them...

770
01:23:00,580 --> 01:23:03,458
Those 2 will be useful to me

771
01:23:08,580 --> 01:23:10,013
What's happening?

772
01:24:18,100 --> 01:24:19,897
They've been expecting us...

773
01:24:21,580 --> 01:24:24,048
Don't use your weapon

774
01:24:30,540 --> 01:24:32,053
No! Don't!

775
01:24:39,100 --> 01:24:42,649
Help!

776
01:24:54,100 --> 01:24:56,694
Kill him!

777
01:25:00,100 --> 01:25:02,011
That's good.

778
01:25:18,100 --> 01:25:21,012
The inspector and Narisara...

779
01:25:24,860 --> 01:25:27,454
What have you done with them?

780
01:25:27,540 --> 01:25:29,417
l'll turn them into zombies

781
01:25:29,500 --> 01:25:31,650
Stop your evil doing..

782
01:25:31,740 --> 01:25:33,378
Or you'll die wandering...
Never to be reborn

783
01:25:49,660 --> 01:25:51,139
Are you alright?

784
01:25:53,100 --> 01:25:55,455
My head feels dizzy

785
01:26:39,020 --> 01:26:40,692
Stop! This is the police!

786
01:26:40,780 --> 01:26:42,259
Don't shoot!

787
01:26:55,980 --> 01:26:58,733
Those 2 are still out cold

788
01:27:02,860 --> 01:27:06,296
We can't use this dump to create
the half breeds you want

789
01:27:06,380 --> 01:27:08,052
Shut your mouth!

790
01:27:08,140 --> 01:27:13,976
What you want us to do takes
scientific equipment...

791
01:27:14,060 --> 01:27:16,813
lt's not as easy as witch spells
and chants

792
01:27:20,740 --> 01:27:23,652
Don't get smart with me

793
01:27:35,300 --> 01:27:38,178
That smell in here is getting stronger

794
01:27:38,260 --> 01:27:40,137
My eyes are getting blurry

795
01:28:00,420 --> 01:28:03,730
How long will you keep marking
my destruction?

796
01:28:04,100 --> 01:28:06,773
As long as you keep doing your evil...

797
01:28:06,860 --> 01:28:09,693
l must teach you a chasten lesson

798
01:28:22,700 --> 01:28:25,533
Why is the air so cold in here?

799
01:28:28,100 --> 01:28:29,374
Everyone be alert...

800
01:28:30,100 --> 01:28:32,660
l have a feeling something's not right?

801
01:28:39,860 --> 01:28:43,899
Power of the almighty Gods...

802
01:28:44,100 --> 01:28:47,012
Powers of all hell...

803
01:28:47,300 --> 01:28:53,489
Grant me the power...

804
01:29:00,980 --> 01:29:03,414
You again bald monk

805
01:29:06,500 --> 01:29:07,728
Yaithong...

806
01:29:07,820 --> 01:29:10,937
When are you going to stop
your evil doing?

807
01:29:11,380 --> 01:29:13,769
You burn your herbs...

808
01:29:13,860 --> 01:29:17,057
Causing hallucinations to
those who inhale...

809
01:29:17,140 --> 01:29:20,450
You feed them your boiled herbs
to brainwash them

810
01:29:20,540 --> 01:29:21,689
Stop!

811
01:29:26,740 --> 01:29:28,856
What are we going to do with them?

812
01:29:29,380 --> 01:29:32,178
Your cloning business...

813
01:29:32,260 --> 01:29:34,820
Was set up for wealthy millionaires...

814
01:29:34,900 --> 01:29:37,050
And only for few powerful people

815
01:29:37,140 --> 01:29:38,971
What would you know?

816
01:29:39,060 --> 01:29:42,097
lt wasn't to help out the world
as you said

817
01:29:42,180 --> 01:29:43,977
Just stop it!

818
01:29:44,420 --> 01:29:45,535
ln this world...

819
01:29:45,620 --> 01:29:48,054
No one does anything for nothing

820
01:29:48,420 --> 01:29:50,809
l can guarantee you this Dr.

821
01:29:50,900 --> 01:29:52,413
No matter what happens...

822
01:29:52,500 --> 01:29:54,172
We will build up a new lab...

823
01:29:54,260 --> 01:29:55,375
Understand?

824
01:29:55,460 --> 01:29:58,770
There's no way until
we kill the old witch

825
01:30:19,140 --> 01:30:20,858
Come on...
We must find the Buddhist father

826
01:30:20,940 --> 01:30:22,339
What about those 2?

827
01:30:23,020 --> 01:30:24,089
Forget about them

828
01:31:04,220 --> 01:31:05,892
Hurry!

829
01:31:05,980 --> 01:31:08,016
Everyone follow me this way

830
01:31:12,740 --> 01:31:14,412
Let's go Dr.

831
01:31:14,500 --> 01:31:16,889
This is our chance to get out of here

832
01:31:17,100 --> 01:31:18,055
Where will we go?

833
01:31:18,140 --> 01:31:21,212
There must be someplace we could go...

834
01:31:27,580 --> 01:31:28,979
Father...

835
01:31:32,380 --> 01:31:34,211
He doesn't look good...

836
01:31:34,300 --> 01:31:36,131
Take the father out of here...Go!

837
01:31:37,300 --> 01:31:39,530
We must hurry father...

838
01:31:39,620 --> 01:31:41,815
Narisara follow me...

839
01:31:49,540 --> 01:31:55,092
Pichit...

840
01:32:08,780 --> 01:32:10,691
Go and find the doctor...

841
01:32:10,780 --> 01:32:12,099
Don't worry about me

842
01:32:21,420 --> 01:32:22,409
Hurry!

843
01:32:33,180 --> 01:32:36,968
Narisara!

844
01:32:38,300 --> 01:32:40,336
Yaithong stabbed me

845
01:32:41,820 --> 01:32:42,775
We must get out of here...

846
01:32:43,780 --> 01:32:45,498
Get up

847
01:33:20,020 --> 01:33:22,614
All of you listen to me...

848
01:33:22,980 --> 01:33:24,811
l'm the one that cloned you...

849
01:33:24,900 --> 01:33:26,094
Created you...

850
01:33:26,180 --> 01:33:27,977
You can't do anything to me

851
01:33:30,500 --> 01:33:33,094
They won't listen to you...

852
01:33:33,860 --> 01:33:36,420
They drank my herbal potion...

853
01:33:36,500 --> 01:33:38,058
lt's changed their soul...

854
01:33:38,500 --> 01:33:40,968
Did you hear what she said...

855
01:33:41,060 --> 01:33:42,618
She's drugged you

856
01:33:45,380 --> 01:33:47,496
Kill her!

857
01:33:47,580 --> 01:33:48,615
Do you hear me...

858
01:33:48,700 --> 01:33:50,418
Kill the witch!

859
01:33:51,100 --> 01:33:53,773
They won't listen to you...

860
01:33:54,140 --> 01:33:55,971
They listen only to me...

861
01:33:56,060 --> 01:33:57,618
Kill them!

862
01:35:25,700 --> 01:35:26,849
l'll take you to the hospital...

863
01:35:26,940 --> 01:35:28,259
You'll be alright

864
01:35:28,740 --> 01:35:34,736
There's a statue that Yaithong worships...

865
01:35:34,820 --> 01:35:38,176
lf blood of a virgin touches the statue...

866
01:35:38,260 --> 01:35:42,572
The curse will be broken
and it will become powerless

867
01:35:42,660 --> 01:35:44,855
Let's quickly get out of here father

868
01:35:51,220 --> 01:35:53,051
Anyone who goes against me...

869
01:35:53,140 --> 01:35:55,335
Must die!

870
01:35:55,460 --> 01:35:56,575
Devour them!

871
01:35:56,660 --> 01:35:57,649
Kill them!

872
01:36:22,140 --> 01:36:23,095
lnspector...

873
01:36:23,180 --> 01:36:24,374
Captain...

874
01:36:24,460 --> 01:36:25,575
We came to help you...

875
01:36:25,660 --> 01:36:26,854
Everyone's alright...

876
01:36:26,940 --> 01:36:28,055
Are you alright father?

877
01:36:28,140 --> 01:36:29,539
Narisara

878
01:36:29,740 --> 01:36:30,934
Let's go...

879
01:36:31,020 --> 01:36:33,011
Hurry inspector

880
01:36:56,980 --> 01:36:59,619
That damn woman's blood...

881
01:36:59,700 --> 01:37:03,249
All my spells and curses are broken

882
01:37:12,820 --> 01:37:14,139
What's happening?

883
01:37:15,100 --> 01:37:22,051
For 50 years l've worshipped
you through my brahmacharya....

884
01:37:22,420 --> 01:37:24,331
Don't leave me...

885
01:37:24,420 --> 01:37:26,058
Come back to me...

886
01:37:26,740 --> 01:37:28,696
l'm going inside

887
01:37:28,780 --> 01:37:31,340
Wait! Don't!

888
01:37:31,420 --> 01:37:33,092
Don't go in!

889
01:37:33,180 --> 01:37:34,693
lt's dangerous!

890
01:37:34,780 --> 01:37:36,736
Come back!

891
01:37:41,340 --> 01:37:43,934
Don't leave me...

892
01:37:57,020 --> 01:37:58,738
What are you doing?

893
01:38:00,780 --> 01:38:02,179
Get away!

894
01:38:02,460 --> 01:38:04,178
Stay back!

895
01:38:28,460 --> 01:38:32,817
ln the end l'm smarter than all
of you in here

896
01:38:33,180 --> 01:38:34,408
Stop!

897
01:38:35,260 --> 01:38:37,057
Stop torturing them!

898
01:38:38,620 --> 01:38:39,655
l'm begging you

899
01:38:39,740 --> 01:38:41,458
Begging me?

900
01:39:09,540 --> 01:39:15,251
Get out! Hurry!

901
01:41:22,540 --> 01:41:24,770
They've been operating for 6 hours now...

902
01:41:24,860 --> 01:41:28,011
l've never seen an operation so long

903
01:41:31,580 --> 01:41:33,536
He's the only one that's left...

904
01:41:33,820 --> 01:41:35,378
l want him to stay with us

905
01:41:40,700 --> 01:41:41,849
How is he Dr.?

906
01:41:42,380 --> 01:41:44,098
His wounds are sever...

907
01:41:44,220 --> 01:41:45,812
He's very strong...

908
01:41:45,900 --> 01:41:50,098
His body is constantly adapting and
healing itself...

909
01:41:50,540 --> 01:41:52,770
This is new breed that was recreated...

910
01:41:52,860 --> 01:41:54,578
lt's the only one left in this world

911
01:41:55,100 --> 01:41:57,489
We give him no more than 24 hours

912
01:41:57,580 --> 01:42:01,414
Before we put him on anesthetic
for surgery...

913
01:42:01,500 --> 01:42:03,968
He was still conscious
when he told us that...

914
01:42:04,060 --> 01:42:12,490
He would like to donate his heart
to Naris and his kidney to Louis

915
01:42:14,700 --> 01:42:16,850
Why would he do that?

916
01:42:16,940 --> 01:42:19,659
He would sacrifice his life for another

917
01:42:19,740 --> 01:42:22,129
lf we don't do as he requested...

918
01:42:22,220 --> 01:42:24,370
He will put a deadline on his own life...

919
01:42:24,460 --> 01:42:27,850
Right now that's lesser than 24 hours

920
01:42:29,740 --> 01:42:32,129
He was born to live for someone else...

921
01:42:32,220 --> 01:42:36,099
By doing this he's just hurting himself

922
01:42:36,860 --> 01:42:38,612
We don't really know how...

923
01:42:38,700 --> 01:42:47,176
But we believe he can delay his death...

924
01:42:47,260 --> 01:42:50,616
The truth is he should've
already been dead

925
01:42:50,700 --> 01:42:52,611
l believe he speaks the truth...

926
01:42:52,700 --> 01:42:55,339
He has a pure and kind heart...

927
01:42:55,420 --> 01:42:57,172
There are lots of reasons...

928
01:42:57,260 --> 01:42:59,296
To why he doesn't want to live

929
01:42:59,380 --> 01:43:01,610
So we just let him die father?

930
01:43:01,700 --> 01:43:03,770
We can't prolong his life for him...

931
01:43:03,860 --> 01:43:06,772
He controls his mind and body

932
01:43:07,060 --> 01:43:11,576
lt's because he wants my father
to have his heart...

933
01:43:12,180 --> 01:43:14,694
And Col. Louis to have his kidney

934
01:43:55,620 --> 01:43:58,088
We've successfully transplanted
the new heart...

935
01:43:58,180 --> 01:44:02,332
The body has accepted the heart
extremely well...

936
01:44:02,420 --> 01:44:03,569
As for Col. Louis...

937
01:44:03,660 --> 01:44:05,696
We've also transplanted the new kidney

938
01:44:09,260 --> 01:44:11,137
And...

939
01:44:13,660 --> 01:44:19,610
The patient that donated both
organs has peacefully past away
