WEN:
Tell them to go away.

182
00:11:23,858 --> 00:11:25,616
Please make them go away.

183
00:11:25,651 --> 00:11:26,551
Wen, please.

184
00:11:26,586 --> 00:11:28,960
Uh, we weren't expecting
visitors.

185
00:11:28,995 --> 00:11:31,897
I don't want to sound rude,
but we'd like to be left alone.

186
00:11:31,932 --> 00:11:33,393
I understand.

187
00:11:33,428 --> 00:11:35,362
And I'm sorry to intrude
on your vacation,

188
00:11:35,397 --> 00:11:38,200
especially in such
a beautiful place as this.

189
00:11:38,235 --> 00:11:39,432
Make them go away!

190
00:11:39,467 --> 00:11:41,038
(quietly):
Wen.

191
00:11:41,073 --> 00:11:43,403
You should know that
this isn't easy for us, either.

192
00:11:43,438 --> 00:11:45,878
None of us have been
to this lake before.

193
00:11:45,913 --> 00:11:47,781
And the four of us,
we never thought

194
00:11:47,816 --> 00:11:50,245
we'd be here talking
to you nice people.

195
00:11:52,744 --> 00:11:54,414
(chain rattles)

196
00:11:54,449 --> 00:11:56,416
Who else is out there with you?

197
00:11:56,451 --> 00:11:58,418
I'm here with Sabrina, Adriane
and Redmond.

198
00:11:58,453 --> 00:11:59,925
And the four of us are here

199
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:03,522
because we're trying to save
a whole bunch of people.

200
00:12:03,557 --> 00:12:04,996
Eric, come here. Come here.

201
00:12:05,031 --> 00:12:07,196
LEONARD: But we need
your help to do that.

202
00:12:07,231 --> 00:12:09,165
We can't do anything
without you,

203
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,727
and speaking through a door

204
00:12:10,762 --> 00:12:14,038
is making a difficult
conversation near impossible.

205
00:12:14,073 --> 00:12:15,633
(whispers):
What?

206
00:12:17,043 --> 00:12:19,076

207
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:21,947
(whispering): There's a woman
carrying something

208
00:12:21,982 --> 00:12:23,641
that looks like a pick
with a chain

209
00:12:23,676 --> 00:12:25,709
and a mallet head at the end.

210
00:12:29,253 --> 00:12:31,220

There's no dial tone.

ERIC:
What?

214
00:12:43,102 --> 00:12:44,530
I checked it when we got here.

215
00:12:44,565 --> 00:12:46,004
Is the battery dead?

216
00:12:46,039 --> 00:12:47,599
ANDREW: The battery's not dead.
It's not dialing.

00:12:55,642 --> 00:12:57,312
Yeah, well,
we don't have a choice, either!

We're calling the cops!

ADRIANE: Hey, um,
we know you can't do that.

222
00:13:02,484 --> 00:13:04,649
None of our phones get service
out here, either.

223
00:13:04,684 --> 00:13:07,960

We don't mean to rush you,

228
00:13:18,731 --> 00:13:21,765
but we're a little pressed
for time.

229
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:24,878
Please open the door so we can
have a real conversation.

do you... -Shh. -Wen, Wen.

359
00:20:14,982 --> 00:20:16,146
(door clatters)

360
00:20:16,181 --> 00:20:18,214
LEONARD:
You have to believe that.

361
00:20:18,249 --> 00:20:20,656
But we had no idea
you were a single-sex couple

362
00:20:20,691 --> 00:20:23,428
until we got here.

363
00:20:23,463 --> 00:20:25,331
That one was a surprise.

364
00:20:25,366 --> 00:20:29,060
Well, I guess if you promise,
then I have to believe you.

365
00:20:29,865 --> 00:20:32,305
I mean, we're normal people
just like you.

366
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:35,374
-We have no choice.
-There's always a choice!

367
00:20:36,234 --> 00:20:38,905
ADRIANE:
He's right about that.

368
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:42,414
Our choices make our destiny.

369
00:20:42,449 --> 00:20:45,285
I almost got that tattooed.
(laughs softly)

370
00:20:48,851 --> 00:20:51,049
Okay, you're right, Andrew.

371
00:20:51,084 --> 00:20:52,688
There's always a choice.

372
00:20:52,723 --> 00:20:55,427
So we choose to be here.

373
00:20:55,462 --> 00:20:58,364
Can everyone come in here,
please?

374
00:20:58,399 --> 00:21:00,498
It's almost time.

375
00:21:00,533 --> 00:21:02,434
Time for what?

376
00:21:02,469 --> 00:21:04,535
You don't need us tied up.

377
00:21:05,505 --> 00:21:08,264
You said you were here to talk,
so we'll talk.

378
00:21:08,299 --> 00:21:11,311
(Andrew grunting)

379
00:21:17,781 --> 00:21:18,945
(Sabrina exhales)

380
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:22,311
Hi, Eric, Wen...

381
00:21:22,346 --> 00:21:23,521
(clears throat)

382
00:21:23,556 --> 00:21:26,117
...and Andrew.

383
00:21:26,152 --> 00:21:28,284
My name is Sabrina.

384
00:21:28,319 --> 00:21:32,024
I live in Southern California.

385
00:21:32,059 --> 00:21:34,763
I live in a town
you've probably never heard of.

386
00:21:34,798 --> 00:21:41,033
I have been a post-op nurse
for almost five years.

387
00:21:41,068 --> 00:21:45,268
I used most of my savings

388
00:21:45,303 --> 00:21:47,336
to come out to Pennsylvania,

389
00:21:47,371 --> 00:21:50,911
to come here to talk
with you guys.

390
00:21:50,946 --> 00:21:53,078
(shuddered breathing)

391
00:21:56,050 --> 00:21:59,392
I have a little
half sister back home...

392
00:22:00,186 --> 00:22:04,155
...and, Wen,
you kind of remind me of her.

393
00:22:07,259 --> 00:22:09,798
(Sabrina and Leonard
clear their throats)

394
00:22:10,702 --> 00:22:12,933
(clears throat)

395
00:22:14,068 --> 00:22:15,738
Well, I think you-you guys
already know

396
00:22:15,773 --> 00:22:17,542
my name is Leonard.

397
00:22:17,577 --> 00:22:19,676
And, uh,

398
00:22:19,711 --> 00:22:21,876
I'm good at catching
grasshoppers, right, Wen?

399
00:22:21,911 --> 00:22:23,812
(grunts)

400
00:22:27,114 --> 00:22:28,619
I'm from Chicago.

401
00:22:28,654 --> 00:22:29,884
I'm a second grade teacher,

402
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:33,558
and I run
the after-school program.

403
00:22:33,593 --> 00:22:35,560
I'm also a bartender. I...

404
00:22:35,595 --> 00:22:37,595
Okay. Me?

405
00:22:37,630 --> 00:22:38,893
Am I next?

406
00:22:38,928 --> 00:22:40,466
Hi there.

407
00:22:40,501 --> 00:22:43,194
I'm Redmond, and I like
long walks on the beach,

408
00:22:43,229 --> 00:22:44,833
-and I like beer.
-LEONARD: Hey.

409
00:22:44,868 --> 00:22:46,230
We already discussed this.

410
00:22:46,265 --> 00:22:48,265
They deserve to know who we are.

411
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:53,336
We wasted time for this guy
to wake up.

412
00:22:53,371 --> 00:22:56,680
You know, this get-to-know-you
stuff doesn't matter at all.

413
00:22:56,715 --> 00:23:00,684
Doesn't change what we have
to do or what they have to do.

414
00:23:00,719 --> 00:23:05,249
When you say stuff like that,
you sound how you sound,

415
00:23:05,284 --> 00:23:08,054
okay, you just scare them,
you make it less likely

416
00:23:08,089 --> 00:23:10,958
that they'll believe us
or cooperate.

417
00:23:10,993 --> 00:23:14,467
Okay, okay, my turn it is.

418
00:23:14,502 --> 00:23:17,228
I live in Medford,
Massachusetts.

419
00:23:17,263 --> 00:23:19,164
I work for the gas company,

420
00:23:19,199 --> 00:23:23,003
making sure houses
and apartments don't blow up.

421
00:23:23,038 --> 00:23:25,973
I'm single,
if you can believe that.

422
00:23:27,548 --> 00:23:31,407
I've done some time,
as they say.

423
00:23:32,982 --> 00:23:36,049
Did a lot of, uh...

424
00:23:36,084 --> 00:23:40,493
questionable stuff
when I was young and stupid.

425
00:23:41,859 --> 00:23:44,387
But I'm much better now.

426
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:50,800
And my father used to beat
the shit out of me,

427
00:23:50,835 --> 00:23:52,131
like Andrew just did.

428
00:23:53,838 --> 00:23:56,773
Wish I could go back in time,

429
00:23:56,808 --> 00:23:58,973
give the kid-me this thing.

430
00:23:59,008 --> 00:24:01,745
May I speak now?

431
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:03,373
I hope I don't sound confusing.

432
00:24:03,408 --> 00:24:05,474
ERIC:
Hold on, hold on a second.

433
00:24:05,509 --> 00:24:07,212
Wh...

434
00:24:07,247 --> 00:24:09,588
We get that you guys
are a part of some group

435
00:24:09,623 --> 00:24:13,757
and it sounds like,
it sounds like you want to...

436
00:24:13,792 --> 00:24:15,561
fix things.

437
00:24:15,596 --> 00:24:17,189
To help.

438
00:24:17,224 --> 00:24:18,696
ANDREW: Eric, you don't have
to try to talk...

439
00:24:18,731 --> 00:24:20,489
I... No, no, I'm okay.
I want to say this.

440
00:24:20,524 --> 00:24:24,702
If you're try...
trying to recruit us,

441
00:24:24,737 --> 00:24:26,572
I mean, why else bother

442
00:24:26,607 --> 00:24:29,740
introducing yourselves to us,
right?

443
00:24:29,775 --> 00:24:36,076
If you're trying to change us
or make us different,

444
00:24:36,111 --> 00:24:38,914
all of this...

445
00:24:38,949 --> 00:24:41,312
(voice breaking):
this isn't the way.

446
00:24:43,184 --> 00:24:45,316
Can someone put the curtain
on the back door?

447
00:24:45,351 --> 00:24:46,889
What's wrong with Eric?

448
00:24:46,924 --> 00:24:48,187
When you have a concussion,

449
00:24:48,222 --> 00:24:49,727
you're extremely sensitive
to light.

450
00:24:49,762 --> 00:24:51,355
Well, there-there's nothing
we can do about that now.

451
00:24:51,390 --> 00:24:52,862
Well, he's only gonna
get better if he rests

452
00:24:52,897 --> 00:24:54,633
in a darkened room
or if we make it dark in here.

453
00:24:54,668 --> 00:24:56,327
We shouldn't move him
until we make our proposal.

454
00:24:56,362 --> 00:24:57,768
He might need to be
in a darkened room for days,

455
00:24:57,803 --> 00:24:59,836
-not just a few hours.
-You're not separating me

456
00:24:59,871 --> 00:25:01,200
from Andrew and Wen.

457
00:25:01,235 --> 00:25:03,609
I'll see what I can do
with the curtains.

458
00:25:03,644 --> 00:25:04,940
So, whatever.

459
00:25:04,975 --> 00:25:07,910
I'm, um, I'm Adriane.

460
00:25:07,945 --> 00:25:10,682
Yeah, I-I've been a lot
of things, but-but right now,

461
00:25:10,717 --> 00:25:14,686
or, um, before I got up here,
I-I was a line cook

462
00:25:14,721 --> 00:25:19,218
at a Mexican restaurant
in-in Dupont Circle, D.C.

463
00:25:20,023 --> 00:25:22,056
I love to feed people.

464
00:25:22,091 --> 00:25:24,861
It feels like it's more
than food to me.

465
00:25:24,896 --> 00:25:27,490
Um, God, what else?

466
00:25:27,525 --> 00:25:28,964
Uh...

467
00:25:28,999 --> 00:25:32,000
Oh, I have, um, I have two cats.

468
00:25:32,035 --> 00:25:33,529
And you'd love them, Wen.

469
00:25:33,564 --> 00:25:37,104
Their names are Riff and Raff.

470
00:25:37,139 --> 00:25:39,172
Do you like cats, Wen?

471
00:25:39,207 --> 00:25:41,746
You don't have to answer her,
sweetie.

472
00:25:41,781 --> 00:25:43,440
LEONARD:
Sorry, Wen.

473
00:25:43,475 --> 00:25:45,310
Maybe I'll put it back on
later, okay?

474
00:25:45,345 --> 00:25:48,016
Forget the curtains.

475
00:25:48,051 --> 00:25:50,051
It's time.

476
00:25:54,926 --> 00:25:57,157
(insects chirring)

477
00:26:05,068 --> 00:26:08,938
The four of us are here
to prevent the apocalypse.

478
00:26:10,106 --> 00:26:13,338
We-- and when I say "we,"
I mean everyone in this cabin--

479
00:26:13,373 --> 00:26:17,177
can stop it from happening,
but only with your help.

480
00:26:19,478 --> 00:26:23,414
Ultimately,
whether the world ends or not

481
00:26:23,449 --> 00:26:26,758
is completely up to you three.

482
00:26:27,893 --> 00:26:31,455
You are having a psychological
break of some kind.

483
00:26:40,532 --> 00:26:43,742
Your family must choose
to willingly sacrifice

484
00:26:43,777 --> 00:26:45,106
one of the three of you

485
00:26:45,141 --> 00:26:47,713
in order to prevent
the apocalypse.

486
00:26:50,817 --> 00:26:54,753
After you make what I know
is an impossible decision,

487
00:26:54,788 --> 00:26:57,580
you must then kill
the one you choose.

488
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:03,322
If you fail to choose,

489
00:27:03,357 --> 00:27:07,700
or if you fail to follow through
with the sacrifice,

490
00:27:07,735 --> 00:27:10,131
the world will end.

491
00:27:10,166 --> 00:27:13,497
You three will live,

492
00:27:13,532 --> 00:27:16,203
but the rest of humanity,

493
00:27:16,238 --> 00:27:21,076
seven billion plus...

494
00:27:21,111 --> 00:27:22,572
will perish.

495
00:27:22,607 --> 00:27:24,849
(Andrew's breath shuddering)

496
00:27:26,017 --> 00:27:27,577
They're lunatics.

497
00:27:28,646 --> 00:27:30,481
And you will all live
long enough

498
00:27:30,516 --> 00:27:34,727
to witness the horror
of the end of everything.

499
00:27:34,762 --> 00:27:39,864
And you will be left to wander
the devastated planet alone.

500
00:27:41,461 --> 00:27:46,299
Permanently
and cosmically... alone.

501
00:27:47,775 --> 00:27:50,468
ERIC:
Leonard.

502
00:27:51,306 --> 00:27:53,570
We haven't done anything wrong.

503
00:27:53,605 --> 00:27:55,308
I agree with you. You haven't.

504
00:27:55,343 --> 00:27:59,642
You haven't done anything wrong
to... to deserve this burden.

505
00:28:03,153 --> 00:28:07,419
You're just the family chosen
to decide for us in this time.

506
00:28:17,596 --> 00:28:19,871
LEONARD: Look,
we're not here to hurt you.

507
00:28:19,906 --> 00:28:22,368
If we wanted to hurt you,
we would've used duct tape

508
00:28:22,403 --> 00:28:24,909
-instead of ropes.
-You stop.

509
00:28:27,243 --> 00:28:28,913
You have to understand
that we cannot

510
00:28:28,948 --> 00:28:31,982
and will not choose who has
to be sacrificed for you.

511
00:28:32,017 --> 00:28:35,711
And just as importantly,
we cannot act for you.

512
00:28:35,746 --> 00:28:37,757
And you cannot kill yourselves.

513
00:28:38,683 --> 00:28:40,650
We're not choosing anyone.

514
00:28:40,685 --> 00:28:42,751
We're not sacrificing anyone.

515
00:28:42,786 --> 00:28:44,621
Not now, not ever.

516
00:28:44,656 --> 00:28:47,591
Even if it means the death
of everyone else in the world?

517
00:28:47,626 --> 00:28:49,758
Yes. Even if I believe
the world was at stake,

518
00:28:49,793 --> 00:28:53,135
which I don't,
that's what it means.

519
00:28:53,170 --> 00:28:54,807
I would watch the world die
a hundred times over

520
00:28:54,842 --> 00:28:57,238
-before having to...
-REDMOND: Christ.

521
00:28:57,273 --> 00:28:59,240
Waste of time.

522
00:28:59,275 --> 00:29:02,441
They're never gonna choose
to do this.

523
00:29:02,476 --> 00:29:04,443
And I don't blame them.

524
00:29:04,478 --> 00:29:06,610
-Who would ever choose...
-ADRIANE: Shut up, Redmond.

525
00:29:06,645 --> 00:29:09,382
You just vomit
everything you think.

526
00:29:09,417 --> 00:29:11,890
Oh, God, we are so screwed.
(sniffles)

527
00:29:11,925 --> 00:29:13,716
LEONARD:
Okay,

528
00:29:13,751 --> 00:29:16,521
you need to listen
to this part, too.

529
00:29:16,556 --> 00:29:18,259
I've been shown exactly
what will happen

530
00:29:18,294 --> 00:29:20,360
if you choose not to make
a sacrifice.

531
00:29:20,395 --> 00:29:22,626
We've all been shown.

532
00:29:22,661 --> 00:29:25,838
We couldn't stop drawing
the visions we saw.

533
00:29:25,873 --> 00:29:30,040
I actually thought
something was wrong with me,

534
00:29:30,075 --> 00:29:31,976
but the visions were so strong,

535
00:29:32,011 --> 00:29:35,848
so specific and so, so real.

536
00:29:35,883 --> 00:29:38,510
Sabrina, Adriane and Redmond,
they had the visions, too.

537
00:29:38,545 --> 00:29:43,350
So, that led us
to each other and...

538
00:29:43,385 --> 00:29:46,716
and that led us here
to this exact cabin.

539
00:29:46,751 --> 00:29:50,258
We have no idea
why we were picked.

(chain rattling)

541
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:01,665
First, the cities will drown.

542
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:06,274
The oceans will swell
and rise up into a great fist

543
00:30:06,309 --> 00:30:09,310
and pound all the buildings
and people into the sand,

544
00:30:09,345 --> 00:30:10,806

547
00:30:15,846 --> 00:30:18,451

will descend

548
00:30:18,486 --> 00:30:19,782

with fever,

549

would produce
a catastrophic earthquake.

00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:08,139

I would, too.

841
00:45:49,889 --> 00:45:51,647
Truth is,
I haven't even been to church

when I was little.

I always thought religious stuff
was so tired and boring

844
00:45:58,227 --> 00:46:02,526
from another time, and people
were scared of shadows.

845
00:46:06,268 --> 00:46:08,807
Then the visions started.

846
00:46:12,769 --> 00:46:15,605
I didn't believe it at first,
either.

847
00:46:17,246 --> 00:46:19,609
But you will.

848
00:46:24,385 --> 00:46:27,683
When I was a kid,
my dad used to say to me,

849
00:46:27,718 --> 00:46:31,456
"Trust in something
more than you."

850
00:46:33,130 --> 00:46:38,430
It's sort of become my mantra
these past few days.

851
00:46:39,235 --> 00:46:41,730
I said it
when I saw the visions.

852
00:46:41,765 --> 00:46:43,908
I said it when I built my weapon

853
00:46:43,943 --> 00:46:46,009
exactly the way
it was shown to me.

854
00:46:46,044 --> 00:46:47,637
I said it over and over

855
00:46:47,672 --> 00:46:51,443
as I passed every freeway exit
on my way here.

856
00:46:53,249 --> 00:46:55,678
I said it when I walked out
onto the boardwalk

857
00:46:55,713 --> 00:46:57,988
and I saw the others.

858
00:46:58,782 --> 00:47:02,553
We were all wearing the same
colors we saw in our visions.

859
00:47:02,588 --> 00:47:05,556
That's when I knew
I wasn't alone.

860
00:47:07,692 --> 00:47:10,033
(voice breaking):
And all of this...

861
00:47:12,499 --> 00:47:14,796
...is real.

862
00:47:16,976 --> 00:47:19,702
And I'm saying it
to you now, Eric,

863
00:47:19,737 --> 00:47:21,473
you need to trust something
more than you.

864
00:47:21,508 --> 00:47:26,016
You may not want to believe it,
but we're all on the same side.

865
00:47:28,284 --> 00:47:30,922
I'm on my family's side.

866

870
00:48:06,685 --> 00:48:09,257
(whispering):
Eric?

871
00:48:09,292 --> 00:48:11,424
You really okay?

872
00:48:12,493 --> 00:48:15,725
My head's still ringing,
but my vision is clearer.

873
00:48:17,135 --> 00:48:18,596
(Andrew breathes deeply)

874
00:48:24,835 --> 00:48:26,340

earthquake happened

875
00:48:26,375 --> 00:48:28,177
a whole four hours ago, right?

876
00:48:28,212 --> 00:48:30,014
Before they showed up here.

877
00:48:30,049 --> 00:48:32,280
Leonard's checked his watch
a thousand times.

878
00:48:32,315 --> 00:48:34,645
They've been timing all of this.

879
00:48:35,450 --> 00:48:36,416
I know.

880
00:48:36,451 --> 00:48:39,089
(footsteps overhead)

881
00:48:42,457 --> 00:48:44,523
I just don't want you to...

882
00:48:46,758 --> 00:48:48,593
I don't want you to be spooked
or anything.

883
00:48:48,628 --> 00:48:50,298
You think I believe them?

884
00:48:50,333 --> 00:48:51,728
No.

885
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:56,370
No, it's just...

886
00:48:56,405 --> 00:48:57,767

with the novel X-Nine virus,

1098
01:00:58,390 --> 01:01:01,864
which is proving particularly
fatal to children.

1099
01:01:01,899 --> 01:01:04,130
The X-Nine virus
is highly transmittable

1100
01:01:04,165 --> 01:01:06,660
amongst children
aged ten and under.

1101
01:01:06,695 --> 01:01:08,662
These outbreaks seem
to be originating

1102
01:01:08,697 --> 01:01:11,907
in three distinct pockets
of the world:

1103
01:01:11,942 --> 01:01:13,744
Cape Town, Suffolk, England,

1104
01:01:13,779 --> 01:01:16,604
and outside Nashville
in Tennessee.

1105
01:01:16,639 --> 01:01:19,277
Lockdowns in these areas
have already begun

1106
01:01:19,312 --> 01:01:21,180
as numbers rise along with fear

1107
01:01:21,215 --> 01:01:23,380
for the safety
of those infected.

1108
01:01:23,415 --> 01:01:25,855
Numerous public schools
have been suspended

1109
01:01:25,890 --> 01:01:27,219

1110
01:01:27,254 --> 01:01:29,925
into makeshift
quarantine facilities.

1111
01:01:29,960 --> 01:01:32,389

the virus will be contained

1112

in question...

wouldn't exist.

01:17:03,552 --> 01:17:07,587
of as many as 700 airplanes
having crashed without warning,

1413
01:17:07,622 --> 01:17:09,655
without issuing distress calls,

1414
01:17:09,690 --> 01:17:11,932
amid fears
and increasing speculation

1415
01:17:11,967 --> 01:17:14,803
there may have been
a coordinated cyberattack...

1416
01:17:14,838 --> 01:17:17,069
That terrorist stuff
has nothing to do with this.

1417
01:17:17,104 --> 01:17:18,466
LEONARD:
I've heard this before.

1418
01:17:18,501 --> 01:17:20,534
(on TV): TSA has yet
to issue a statement.

1419
01:17:20,569 --> 01:17:23,845
Airports around the globe
are canceling flights.

1420
01:17:25,112 --> 01:17:27,442
-It is hard...
-It is hard...

1421
01:17:27,477 --> 01:17:29,180
-Excuse me.
-Excuse me.

1422
01:17:29,215 --> 01:17:32,315
BOTH: It is hard to describe
the images that we are seeing.

1423
01:17:32,350 --> 01:17:36,418
They fill us with disquietude
and horror.

1424
01:17:36,453 --> 01:17:38,728
We are witnessing
a collective tragedy

1425
01:17:38,763 --> 01:17:41,929
unfathomable
only moments before.

1426
01:17:41,964 --> 01:17:44,195
(Leonard breathing raggedly)

1427
01:17:44,230 --> 01:17:46,593
We are getting word
of more airline...

1428
01:17:47,365 --> 01:17:49,739
How the fuck did you know
what she was gonna say?

1429
01:17:49,774 --> 01:17:53,402
Is this some closed-circuit TV?
Did you guys pump this in?

1430
01:17:53,437 --> 01:17:56,141
Maybe the truth is...

1431
01:17:56,176 --> 01:17:57,571
is that the end was happening

1432
01:17:57,606 --> 01:18:00,783
long before
we got to this cabin.

1433
01:18:00,818 --> 01:18:04,215
And what we're seeing now
isn't the fireworks.

1434
01:18:04,250 --> 01:18:07,086
It's just the final
flickering sparks.

1435
01:18:07,858 --> 01:18:10,155
I don't know
what's going on here,

1436
01:18:10,190 --> 01:18:12,828
but where are the keys
to the truck you guys came in?

1437
01:18:12,863 --> 01:18:14,027
ERIC:
Andrew.

1438
01:18:14,062 --> 01:18:18,196
I'm taking my family...
and we're leaving.

1439
01:18:19,496 --> 01:18:24,334
Do you really think that
everything that happened today,

1440
01:18:24,369 --> 01:18:26,941
everything we've seen...

1441
01:18:28,472 --> 01:18:31,605
Do you really think
it's all just a coincidence?

1442
01:18:32,608 --> 01:18:34,014
Yes.

1443
01:18:34,049 --> 01:18:35,950
I think it's all a coincidence.

1444
01:18:36,777 --> 01:18:39,547
Some horrible,
unexplainable coincidence.

1445
01:18:39,582 --> 01:18:41,219
Or it has to be a trick.

1446
01:18:41,254 --> 01:18:43,221
I have to believe that!

1447
01:18:44,059 --> 01:18:46,488
You already don't believe that.

1448
01:18:48,459 --> 01:18:50,800
I know when someone's lying.

1449
01:18:51,935 --> 01:18:53,594
ANDREW:
Eric...

1450
01:18:53,629 --> 01:18:55,904
let's go.

1451
01:18:57,600 --> 01:19:01,569
Let's get out of here
and never come back.

1452
01:19:03,111 --> 01:19:05,012
Don't listen to Leonard anymore.

1453
01:19:05,047 --> 01:19:07,278
(Andrew breathing jaggedly)

1454
01:19:20,458 --> 01:19:23,657
Can everyone come out
onto the back deck now?

1455
01:19:25,562 --> 01:19:28,596
I'd like to do
this last part outside.

1456
01:19:32,272 --> 01:19:34,404
(Leonard sighs)

1457
01:19:34,439 --> 01:19:36,769
What are you doing
with that, Leonard?

1458
01:19:37,607 --> 01:19:39,277
(Leonard breathing rapidly)

1459
01:19:39,312 --> 01:19:42,643
When I'm gone, you'll only have
minutes to stop everything.

1460
01:19:42,678 --> 01:19:44,986
After that, it'll be too late.

1461
01:19:46,616 --> 01:19:48,187
WEN:
Will all the children die?

1462
01:19:48,222 --> 01:19:50,783
Wen, I want you to take
your music and your headphones

1463
01:19:50,818 --> 01:19:52,994
and go to that tree house
that we climbed in.

1464
01:19:53,029 --> 01:19:56,129
Put your music on until
one of us comes to get you.

1465
01:19:56,164 --> 01:19:58,428
Do what Daddy says, okay?

1466
01:19:58,463 --> 01:20:00,694
(Wen crying)

1467
01:20:01,598 --> 01:20:02,971
I love you, chicken.

1468
01:20:03,006 --> 01:20:04,632
WEN:
I love you, too.

1469
01:20:05,976 --> 01:20:07,910
Go. Go.

1470
01:20:09,111 --> 01:20:11,804
ERIC: Nothing can happen
to the three of us.

1471
01:20:11,839 --> 01:20:13,476
You'll be okay.

1472
01:20:16,349 --> 01:20:19,746
The worst thing about
the visions was the screaming.

1473
01:20:21,123 --> 01:20:23,486
I could hear everyone screaming.

1474
01:20:24,687 --> 01:20:26,126
And I knew
when the visions ended,

1475
01:20:26,161 --> 01:20:30,823
the screaming was just
gonna go on and on.

1476
01:20:34,598 --> 01:20:36,103
(short laugh)

1477
01:20:36,138 --> 01:20:39,073
You know what I loved most
about teaching kids?

1478
01:20:40,373 --> 01:20:42,703
They believe everything you say.

1479
01:20:43,640 --> 01:20:45,739
So you have to be careful.

1480
01:20:46,511 --> 01:20:50,777
Say only what you know,
what you know to be true.

1481
01:20:51,648 --> 01:20:54,055
It's a big responsibility.

1482
01:20:56,719 --> 01:20:59,126
Maybe one of the kids I taught

1483
01:20:59,161 --> 01:21:01,964
