1
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:49,740
High school is like the training wheels...

2
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:52,380
for the bicycle of real life.

3
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:55,820
It is a time when young people can explore...

4
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:57,350
different fields of interests...

5
00:02:57,390 --> 00:03:01,090
and hopefully learn from their experiences.

6
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:04,960
In coming to terms with my own personal setback...

7
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,590
I have been able to learn...

8
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:11,130
that I don't need to rely on drugs and alcohol...

9
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:14,270
and that I'm very lucky...

10
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:19,300
that more people besides myself and Kerry...

11
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:21,140
weren't injured in the accident.

12
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:23,950
And I have learned...

13
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:27,110
that to overcome life's obstacles...

14
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:31,320
you need faith, hope...

15
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:35,820
and above all, a sense of humor.

16
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:43,800
No more education

17
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,430
It's time for celebration

18
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:49,100
'Cause this is the day of our high school graduation

19
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:51,010
We've stayed for the duration

20
00:03:51,050 --> 00:03:52,670
Achieved matriculation

21
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:56,780
Now we're the newest members of the general population

22
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:13,430
God, what a bunch of retards.

23
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:15,460
God, I know. I thought that chipmunk face...

24
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:16,830
was never going to shut up.

25
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:18,630
I know. I liked her so much better...

26
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:20,330
when she was an alcoholic crack addict.

27
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:21,540
She gets in one car wreck...

28
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:22,800
and all of the sudden she's Little Miss Perfect...

29
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,610
and everyone loves her.

30
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:26,550
Let's see if they gave me the right diploma.

31
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:33,980
- What?
- What?

32
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:35,680
These assholes are saying I have to go to summer school...

33
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,020
and take some stupid art class.

34
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:38,180
Why?

35
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:39,420
God, I didn't think that just because you get an "F"...

36
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:41,260
you have to take the whole class over again.

37
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:43,160
Loser.

38
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,840
Wow. This is so bad, it's almost good.

39
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:05,650
This is so bad, it's gone past good and back to bad again.

40
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,220
At least we'll never have to see...

41
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:10,720
any of these creepy faces ever again.

42
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,790
Unless they're in your summer school class.

43
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:16,190
Shut up.

44
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,770
- Don't turn around.
- What? Why?

45
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,460
- Don't turn around.
- Damn it.

46
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:27,070
Oh, my God. You guys, I can't believe we made it.

47
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:29,200
Yeah. We graduated high school.

48
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:31,210
How totally amazing.

49
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:32,840
So, what are you guys doing this summer?

50
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,010
Nothing.

51
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:36,070
Well, I'm going to this actor's workshop...

52
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:39,550
and I'm hoping to start auditions soon.

53
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:41,610
Oh, we have to get together this summer.

54
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:45,960
Yeah. That'll definitely happen.

55
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:48,590
Well, bye, you guys.

56
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:50,660
Congratulations!

57
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:08,880
- Hey, Rebecca.
- Oh, hi.

58
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:11,250
So, we finally--

59
00:06:11,290 --> 00:06:13,520
What about me? Am I not even here?

60
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:16,350
Hey, Enid.

61
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:20,380
- So, we finally made it, huh?
- Yeah.

62
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:26,000
So, where are you going to go to college?

63
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:27,560
We're not.

64
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,190
Really?

65
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:31,640
Both of you? Why not?

66
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:33,660
Just because.

67
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:36,730
Yeah, we made other plans.

68
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:37,900
I guess I should have figured...

69
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:40,510
that you two would do something different.

70
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:43,520
So, Todd, what are you going to be when you grow up?

71
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:47,950
Well, I'm majoring in Business Administration...

72
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:52,020
and thinking of minoring in Communications, so--

73
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:55,090
See, that's exactly the type of thing we're trying to avoid.

74
00:06:55,130 --> 00:06:56,790
Look at this.

75
00:06:56,830 --> 00:07:00,530
Is Stacy Himmler going out with Rod Harbaugh?

76
00:07:00,570 --> 00:07:02,800
Oh, God. How perfect.

77
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:07,870
He better watch out, or he'll get AIDS when he date-rapes her.

78
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:10,310
Where is the love

79
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:12,970
You said you'd give to me

80
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:14,980
As soon as you were free?

81
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:18,110
Will it ever be?

82
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:22,560
God, just think. We'll never see Dennis again.

83
00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:23,750
Good.

84
00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:26,590
No, really. Think about that.

85
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:30,860
It's actually totally depressing.

86
00:07:44,850 --> 00:07:47,970
Is it crazy for an oil company to care about the environment?

87
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:49,210
We don't think so.

88
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:51,340
I already told you I'm not going to college.

89
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:54,080
I think it's a good idea to keep all your options open.

90
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:58,180
You can even enroll in the winter quarter.

91
00:07:58,230 --> 00:08:00,020
Actually, you could live here...

92
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:02,620
and go to the city college part time...

93
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:05,430
and still get a job if you want.

94
00:08:06,970 --> 00:08:08,270
Look at me. I'm not even listening...

95
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:10,130
to a word you're saying.

96
00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:12,870
Did I tell you who I ran into at the bagel place?

97
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:14,270
Who?

98
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:16,710
- Guess.
- How should I know?

99
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:20,480
Well, someone from the past.

100
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:25,280
- Who?
- You give up?

101
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:27,480
- Yes.
- Maxine.

102
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:32,090
- Not the Maxine?
- Yeah.

103
00:08:33,290 --> 00:08:36,200
Oh, God. How horrifying.

104
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:42,800
It's very good.

105
00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:52,500
Jesus.

106
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:21,800
Check out these people behind you.

107
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:24,710
I'm totally convinced they're Satanists.

108
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:36,520
So when are we gonna start looking for our apartment?

109
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,120
Soon.

110
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,180
I have to wait and see how this summer class goes first.

111
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:42,910
God, it's so weird that we're finally out of high school.

112
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:45,450
We've been waiting for this our whole lives.

113
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,710
It's such a weird feeling.

114
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:50,120
Yeah. It hasn't really hit me yet.

115
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,520
Well, well, well.

116
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:56,620
If it isn't Enid and Rebecca--

117
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:58,960
the little Jewish girl and her Aryan friend.

118
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,800
- You're late, asshole.
- Fine, and how are you?

119
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:03,460
Did you bring the tape?

120
00:10:06,770 --> 00:10:09,400
You never paid me for that tape of the Indian dance routine.

121
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,870
Yes, I did.

122
00:10:12,010 --> 00:10:14,480
You Jews are so clever with money.

123
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:16,810
Fuck you! You stupid redneck hick.

124
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:18,940
Oh, my God. Look, the Satanists are leaving.

125
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:20,750
Hey, we should follow them.

126
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:22,810
Oh, we totally have to.

127
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:28,490
Oh, my God!

128
00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:37,270
So, what do you do if you're a Satanist, anyway?

129
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:40,800
Sacrifice virgins and stuff.

130
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,900
Well, that lets us off the hook.

131
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:47,570
How the hell did we get so far behind them?

132
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:48,770
I don't know. That's just great.

133
00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:51,780
- Jesus!
- Oh, yay.

134
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:55,120
Oh, my God. Look at this.

135
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:59,020
"Wowsville"? Authentic Fifties diner?

136
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:01,890
Since when were there mini-malls in the 1950s?

137
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:08,830
Who could forget this great hit from the Fifties, huh?

138
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:12,460
I feel as though I've stepped into a time warp.

139
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:16,500
Hey, check out the awesome Fifties hairdo on our waiter.

140
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:21,800
Hi. My name is Allen...

141
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:23,840
and I'll be your waiter this afternoon.

142
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:26,980
- Hi, Al.
- Can we call you "Weird Al"?

143
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:29,890
I'd imagine so.

144
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:33,560
You should check out the personals.

145
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:35,990
Maybe our future husbands are trying to contact us.

146
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:41,390
Here we go.

147
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:47,200
"Windsurfing doctor, Mensan IQ, maverick Sagittarius.

148
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:50,040
"Let's hit the clubs, make each other laugh."

149
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:52,130
You can have that one.

150
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:54,510
Jesus, listen to this one.

151
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:57,780
"Do you remember me, airport shuttle, June 7?

152
00:11:57,820 --> 00:12:00,080
"You, striking blond with yellow dress...

153
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,950
"pearl necklace, brown shoes.

154
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:04,320
"I was the bookish fellow in the green cardigan...

155
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:06,450
"who helped you find your contact lens.

156
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:08,960
"Am I crazy, or did we have a moment?"

157
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:10,260
God, that's so pathetic.

158
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:12,920
I mean, she probably didn't even notice him.

159
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:16,420
And he's psychotically obsessing over every little detail.

160
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:18,700
We should call him and pretend to be the blond.

161
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:21,970
Oh, we totally have to.

162
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:25,270
It's his machine.

163
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,640
Hi, it's me.

164
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:32,250
Your striking blond.

165
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:33,580
Of course I remember you.

166
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:35,180
Let's get together for lunch sometime.

167
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:37,810
How about Friday at 1:00?

168
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:41,450
Meet me at my favorite restaurant--Wowsville.

169
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:44,860
It's in the mall on Century Parkway.

170
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:46,630
See you there, darling.

171
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:49,790
Oh, yeah, and be sure to wear that sexy green cardigan.

172
00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:56,400
Oh, it's that comedian I was telling you about.

173
00:12:56,440 --> 00:13:00,900
- I still live with my mother.
- He's the absolute worst.

174
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:05,580
So what if she's been dead for fifteen years?

175
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:07,610
See? That's barely even a joke.

176
00:13:07,650 --> 00:13:11,450
Well, it's like I always say--

177
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:15,620
take my life...please.

178
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:19,150
Joey McCobb, the weirdest man in show business.

179
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,790
If he's so weird, how come he's wearing Nikes?

180
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:26,200
Joey McCobb is our god.

181
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,970
- I want to do him.
- I bet.

182
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:30,130
Actually, he kind of reminds me...

183
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:32,170
of that one guy you went out with--Larry.

184
00:13:32,210 --> 00:13:33,580
God, what look was he going for...

185
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:35,550
a gay tennis player from the Forties?

186
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:38,050
- Fuck you.
- You dated him.

187
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:40,810
Why do you have this?

188
00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:43,320
I don't know. You lent it to me in, like, tenth grade.

189
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:46,520
Oh, look at how cute I am.

190
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:49,390
What a little hose bag.

191
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:54,570
Look, there's my dad with Maxine.

192
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:59,430
God, look at her. What a fucking monster.

193
00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:02,030
If he starts dating her again, I'll kill myself.

194
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:06,900
Listen, lady, you tell me you want to relax your hair.

195
00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:09,780
Sing it a lullaby or use this. It's all I've got.

196
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,480
Hey, what you doing?

197
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:16,150
You have five minutes left on your shift.

198
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:25,430
Well, hello there, young employee of the Sidewinder.

199
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:28,300
Look, I already told you guys, I'm not giving you a ride.

200
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,200
What can you tell me, young man...

201
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:33,860
about the various flavors of frozen yogurt?

202
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:36,500
I'll be done in a minute. Can you guys just wait outside?

203
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:39,100
I don't understand. I simply wish to know--

204
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:40,770
Josh, what are you doing?

205
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:45,080
In addition to our favorites, chocolate and vanilla...

206
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,740
this week we are featuring six-gun strawberry...

207
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:50,410
wild cherry roundup, and ten-gallon tangerine.

208
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:53,650
I don't believe I care for any of those.

209
00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:56,590
What's up, Josh? Give me two packs of cigarettes today.

210
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:59,190
Working overtime. Sixteen hours.

211
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:06,190
And nature's nectar, wake-up Juice.

212
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:10,440
And give me six of these beef jerkys.

213
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:13,470
I'm hungry enough to chew the crotch out of a rag doll.

214
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:15,640
Hey! Hey, you!

215
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,770
How many times I tell you? No shirt, no service.

216
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:19,080
Get the hell out of my store.

217
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,350
What do you think this is, Club Med?

218
00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:22,750
It's America, dude. Learn the rules.

219
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:25,650
No, you learn the rules. We Greeks invented democracy.

220
00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:28,750
- You also invented homos.
- Fuck you.

221
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:31,460
You wish. You got to buy me dinner first.

222
00:15:34,330 --> 00:15:35,460
So...

223
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:37,020
Can we talk about this in a minute?

224
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:38,930
Seriously, I'm, like, this close to being done.

225
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:56,710
Son of a bitch.

226
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:00,520
What do you think you're doing?

227
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,250
Turn off that goddamn noise.

228
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:04,230
Rock 'n' roll, baby. Freedom of speech.

229
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:05,790
What do you think this is, Woodstock?

230
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:09,160
- That guy rules!
- Who, Doug?

231
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:11,730
That guy spends more time in here than I do.

232
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:13,030
It's my parking lot!

233
00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:15,970
So, Josh, will you please give us a ride?

234
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:17,770
- Please, Josh?
- No.

235
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:21,110
- Please? It'll be super fun.
- Please, Josh?

236
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:26,440
Look, I don't see why you guys even need a ride.

237
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,920
You could walk there in two minutes.

238
00:16:28,950 --> 00:16:31,850
It's just an excuse for us to spend time with you, Josh.

239
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:34,320
If this guy freaks out, will you protect us?

240
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,550
This guy has every reason to freak out.

241
00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:39,980
This is a pretty fucked up thing to do to somebody.

242
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:42,450
I think Josh is becoming too mature for us.

243
00:16:47,190 --> 00:16:48,620
Oh, look, maybe that's him.

244
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:51,990
No. It's still twenty-five minutes too early.

245
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:55,800
Aren't there a million places like this?

246
00:16:55,830 --> 00:16:57,820
No. This is the ultimate.

247
00:16:57,870 --> 00:17:01,030
It's, like, the Taj Mahal of fake Fifties diners.

248
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:03,900
So, where's the Weird Al guy?

249
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:08,940
There he is back there.

250
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:11,500
I can see his hair bobbing up and down.

251
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,550
I want to make love to him.

252
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:17,710
I'm gonna tell him you said that.

253
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:21,780
So nice to see you again, ladies.

254
00:17:21,830 --> 00:17:24,160
Hi, Weird Al. My friend here has--

255
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:25,560
Shut up!

256
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:28,160
- She says she wants to--
- Shut up!

257
00:17:30,770 --> 00:17:32,530
Oh, my God.

258
00:17:32,570 --> 00:17:35,770
God, that is obviously him.

259
00:17:54,390 --> 00:17:57,880
Oh, my God. He just ordered a giant glass of milk.

260
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:02,630
That's a vanilla milkshake.

261
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:30,480
Oh, God, this is totally unbearable.

262
00:18:56,290 --> 00:18:59,080
Fucking asshole! What's wrong with you?

263
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:02,790
Oh, my God. It's him.

264
00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:05,950
- Can anybody drive?
- He's insane.

265
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,930
- We should follow him home.
- Forget it.

266
00:19:08,970 --> 00:19:12,870
Come on, Josh. Don't you want to see where this guy lives?

267
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:24,940
God, he lives right in our neighborhood.

268
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:27,350
He doesn't even look all that bummed out really.

269
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:28,820
I know.

270
00:19:28,850 --> 00:19:32,810
Wouldn't he be, like, totally pissed off?

271
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:35,090
This type of thing must happen to him all the time.

272
00:19:37,090 --> 00:19:40,030
Mirror, father, mirror.

273
00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:13,730
That piece is entitled "Mirror, Father, Mirror."

274
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:14,960
I like to show it...

275
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,190
to people that I'm meeting for the first time...

276
00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:21,260
because I think it says so much about who I am...

277
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:27,300
and what it feels like to inhabit my specific skin.

278
00:20:30,410 --> 00:20:34,250
And this is exactly what I'm hoping to get...

279
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:37,250
from each of you over the course of this summer--

280
00:20:37,290 --> 00:20:42,590
a picture of your own self-exploration.

281
00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:48,930
Now, my own background is in video and performance art...

282
00:20:48,970 --> 00:20:52,460
but I'm hoping that doesn't influence you too much...

283
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:57,440
and you'll find your own ways of externalizing the internal.

284
00:20:57,470 --> 00:21:00,930
And at the end of the summer, this class has been invited...

285
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:04,970
to participate in a show of high school art...

286
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:07,850
at the neighborhood activity center.

287
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:11,580
The title of the show will be...

288
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:18,120
"Brotherhood and Community: Art as Dialogue."

289
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:20,220
Are there any questions so far?

290
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,360
Great!

291
00:21:28,410 --> 00:21:31,030
This is really creepy.

292
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:32,870
We just need to find out what apartment he's in...

293
00:21:32,910 --> 00:21:34,670
and we'll stalk him from a distance.

294
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:37,650
I'm afraid if I see him, I'll feel really bad again.

295
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:47,450
This is girl mail.

296
00:21:50,430 --> 00:21:52,660
This is computer catalogs and stuff.

297
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:55,100
"The W.C. Fields Fan Club Newsletter"?

298
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:59,860
Oh, my God. The National Psoriasis Foundation?

299
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:03,030
- Bingo.
- Did you hear something?

300
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:09,840
Come on.

301
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:12,350
What if he recognizes us?

302
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:22,620
Eww, look at this.

303
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:24,290
Eww. Gross.

304
00:22:24,330 --> 00:22:25,820
Kinda cute.

305
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:27,330
It looks like a gross rat.

306
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,090
That's a mongoose.

307
00:22:30,670 --> 00:22:32,070
How much is it?

308
00:22:34,870 --> 00:22:36,960
That's not officially for sale.

309
00:22:37,010 --> 00:22:41,310
I might have to hang on to that for the time being.

310
00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:48,280
So, you looking for anything in particular?

311
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:51,910
Do you have any other old records besides these?

312
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:54,290
Seymour does.

313
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:55,450
Who does?

314
00:22:55,490 --> 00:22:57,360
Oh, him. Seymour.

315
00:22:57,390 --> 00:23:00,590
He's the man with the records.

316
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:09,710
Do you have any old Indian records?

317
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:10,870
Indian records?

318
00:23:10,910 --> 00:23:15,140
Yeah. You know, like, old Indian 1960s rock 'n' roll music.

319
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:18,080
I may have one Hindu 78...

320
00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:19,950
in my collection from the Twenties...

321
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:22,350
but it's not really for sale.

322
00:23:22,390 --> 00:23:25,550
I don't really collect foreign.

323
00:23:30,430 --> 00:23:34,450
Those are all 78s. You play 78s?

324
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:38,930
Maybe not 78s, but I can play regular records.

325
00:23:38,970 --> 00:23:41,400
Well, there's some good stuff in here.

326
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:44,370
- You like old music?
- Yeah, it's good.

327
00:23:44,410 --> 00:23:46,030
There's some choice LPs in here...

328
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:48,600
that reissue some really great old blues stuff.

329
00:23:48,650 --> 00:23:50,940
How about this one? Is it any good?

330
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:53,380
No, that one's not so great.

331
00:23:53,510 --> 00:23:55,070
Excuse me.

332
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:58,210
This is the one I'd recommend.

333
00:23:58,250 --> 00:24:00,150
It's...

334
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:01,910
This track alone by Memphis Minnie...

335
00:24:01,950 --> 00:24:05,280
is worth about $500 if you own the original 78.

336
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:07,520
I know the guy who owns the original...

337
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:09,550
and lent it for use on this reissue.

338
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:11,360
Wow.

339
00:24:13,030 --> 00:24:15,690
- How much is it?
- $1.75.

340
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:22,400
If you don't like it, you can bring it back for a refund.

341
00:24:24,710 --> 00:24:26,270
We're here every Saturday.

342
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,870
I'm sure it's OK.

343
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:38,080
Enjoy.

344
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:41,590
It was so cute how he had his own little bags.

345
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:43,560
I thought I was going to start crying.

346
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:46,030
Yeah, he should totally just kill himself.

347
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:48,050
Oh, here's one.

348
00:24:49,470 --> 00:24:51,230
But you have to share with a...

349
00:24:51,270 --> 00:24:54,070
"nonsmoking feminist and her two cats."

350
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:55,870
I don't know. I kind of like him.

351
00:24:55,910 --> 00:25:00,040
He's the exact opposite of everything I really hate.

352
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:02,340
In a way, he's such a clueless dork...

353
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:03,810
he's almost kind of cool.

354
00:25:03,850 --> 00:25:06,870
That guy is many things, but he's definitely not cool.

355
00:25:09,190 --> 00:25:12,020
This would be good, but there's no kitchen.

356
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:15,080
Yeah, but... you know what I mean.

357
00:25:15,130 --> 00:25:16,560
Not really.

358
00:25:18,290 --> 00:25:20,490
Forget it. I can't explain it.

359
00:25:22,530 --> 00:25:25,830
Oh, my God. What are you guys doing here?

360
00:25:25,870 --> 00:25:27,600
What are you doing here, Melorra?

361
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:29,570
My acting workshop is across the street from here.

362
00:25:29,610 --> 00:25:31,130
I'm just on my break.

363
00:25:31,170 --> 00:25:33,940
Well, we won't keep you.

364
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:37,000
I love this place.

365
00:25:37,050 --> 00:25:41,850
It's so, I don't know... You know, funky.

366
00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:47,650
So, what are you guys up to?

367
00:25:47,690 --> 00:25:48,990
We're looking for apartments.

368
00:25:49,030 --> 00:25:51,290
God, how cool. Where are you moving?

369
00:25:51,330 --> 00:25:54,490
We don't know yet. That's why we're looking.

370
00:25:54,530 --> 00:25:56,190
Somewhere downtown.

371
00:25:56,230 --> 00:25:58,000
God, that's so exciting.

372
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,370
Oops, I should go.

373
00:26:02,410 --> 00:26:05,860
Bye, you guys. Call me. Bye.

374
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:12,980
Funky.

375
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:14,810
What, is she black now?

376
00:26:16,990 --> 00:26:19,390
So, I was thinking that when we look for our apartment...

377
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:23,380
we have to convince these people that we're totally rich yuppies.

378
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:26,360
What are you talking about?

379
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:29,260
That's who people want to rent to.

380
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:33,760
So all we have to do is buy semi-expensive outfits...

381
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,960
and I think it's no big deal.

382
00:26:36,010 --> 00:26:38,060
It'll be really fun.

383
00:26:58,060 --> 00:27:00,330
Honey, have you seen my blue spatula?

384
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:02,520
What, are you making pancakes?

385
00:27:02,570 --> 00:27:06,060
Not if I can't find that goddamn spatula.

386
00:27:18,250 --> 00:27:21,780
That's just great. When did you do that?

387
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:25,720
God, how long have you been standing there?

388
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:28,920
Hey, look. There's the pants.

389
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,690
Where are we going?

390
00:27:30,730 --> 00:27:32,850
Let's go hassle Josh.

391
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:34,060
Hassle?

392
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:37,960
- Oh, look, there he is.
- As always.

393
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,490
Waiting for the bus that never comes.

394
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:41,090
I wonder if he's just totally insane...

395
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:42,260
or he really thinks the bus is coming?

396
00:27:42,310 --> 00:27:43,670
Why don't you just ask him?

397
00:27:49,310 --> 00:27:51,510
Hi. What's your name?

398
00:27:52,850 --> 00:27:54,010
Norman.

399
00:27:56,050 --> 00:27:58,950
- Are you waiting for a bus?
- Yes.

400
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,390
I hate to tell you this...

401
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:05,660
but they canceled this bus line two years ago.

402
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:08,860
There are no more buses on this street.

403
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:11,960
You don't know what you're talking about.

404
00:28:16,910 --> 00:28:18,600
Josh!

405
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:33,510
I bet he's in there jerking off.

406
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:35,460
I'll bet he never jerks off.

407
00:28:35,490 --> 00:28:38,050
Yeah, he's beyond human stuff like that.

408
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:42,960
Should we leave a note?

409
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:46,560
- Yeah. You got a pen?
- Yeah.

410
00:28:54,810 --> 00:29:00,010
"Dear Josh, we came by to fuck you...

411
00:29:00,050 --> 00:29:05,450
"but you were not home. Therefore, you are gay.

412
00:29:05,490 --> 00:29:08,650
"Signed Tiffany and Amber."

413
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:14,460
- You're going to leave that?
- Why not?

414
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:17,300
Why do we have to go in here? I hate this place.

415
00:29:17,330 --> 00:29:19,700
Don't worry. It'll only take a second.

416
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:21,230
Whoever told you that bullshit about boiling...

417
00:29:21,270 --> 00:29:22,740
is out of his mind.

418
00:29:22,770 --> 00:29:26,000
Carpet beetles are the only way to get flesh off a corpse.

419
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:27,600
I'm just telling you what he said.

420
00:29:29,210 --> 00:29:31,580
Don't you creeps ever talk about anything nice?

421
00:29:31,610 --> 00:29:35,850
Don't you ever talk about fluffy kittens or the Easter Bunny?

422
00:29:35,890 --> 00:29:37,610
Look who's talking, Little Miss Badass.

423
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:39,750
Yeah, nice outfit.

424
00:29:39,790 --> 00:29:42,720
Who are you supposed to be, Cyndi Lauper?

425
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:44,620
Blow me, doofus.

426
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:46,490
Oh, my God. Didn't they tell you?

427
00:29:46,530 --> 00:29:48,860
- Tell me what?
- Punk rock is over.

428
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:50,330
I know it's over, asshole.

429
00:29:50,370 --> 00:29:53,960
Want to fuck up the system? Go to business school.

430
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,270
That's what I'm going to do.

431
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:57,170
Get a job at some big corporation...

432
00:29:57,210 --> 00:29:59,440
and, like, fuck things up from the inside.

433
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:03,240
- You know, I'm not even trying--
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

434
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:04,440
Hey, do you have my money?

435
00:30:10,650 --> 00:30:12,380
Oh, how punk.

436
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:13,860
You know that tape sucked, by the way?

437
00:30:13,890 --> 00:30:16,860
- So sorry if it offended Jew.
- Go die, asshole.

438
00:30:16,890 --> 00:30:19,290
- Get a job.
- God, fuck you.

439
00:30:19,330 --> 00:30:21,800
Can we go now?

440
00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:24,800
You know, it's not like I'm some modern punk, dickhead.

441
00:30:24,830 --> 00:30:28,930
It's obviously a 1977 original punk rock look.

442
00:30:28,970 --> 00:30:32,130
Johnny Fuckface over there is too stupid to realize it.

443
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:34,300
I didn't really get it, either.

444
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:36,280
Everyone's too stupid.

445
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:07,320
It took me a while before I got a chance to actually play it...

446
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,120
but once I heard that song, it was like--

447
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:10,390
You liked it, huh?

448
00:33:10,430 --> 00:33:15,200
There's some really rare performances.

449
00:33:15,230 --> 00:33:17,260
What about--Did you like the Memphis Minnie?

450
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:20,140
That was good, too. The whole record was good...

451
00:33:20,170 --> 00:33:22,470
but that one song, "Devil Got My Woman..."

452
00:33:22,510 --> 00:33:25,670
I mostly just keep playing that over and over.

453
00:33:25,710 --> 00:33:27,040
Do you have any other records like that?

454
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:29,210
There are no other records like that.

455
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:34,280
Actually, I have the original 78 in my collection.

456
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:37,290
It's one of maybe five known copies.

457
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:39,520
Wow.

458
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:42,050
Yeah. Do you want to see it?

459
00:33:42,090 --> 00:33:44,060
I can run upstairs and get it.

460
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:47,360
Sure, yeah.

461
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,700
Watch my stuff.

462
00:33:51,670 --> 00:33:54,900
Here we go. It's...

463
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:56,810
It's only about a B-minus.

464
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:58,780
It's got an incipient lam crack...

465
00:33:58,810 --> 00:34:00,740
but it plays decent as I recall.

466
00:34:04,450 --> 00:34:07,320
- Oops, I dropped it!
- Jeez!

467
00:34:07,350 --> 00:34:10,810
I was only kidding.

468
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:12,620
Jesus, Seymour, are you all right?

469
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:15,150
Yeah, it's just...

470
00:34:15,190 --> 00:34:18,460
it's very valuable.

471
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:21,090
Now, last week, I asked you...

472
00:34:21,130 --> 00:34:22,900
to try to create a piece of artwork...

473
00:34:22,930 --> 00:34:28,100
that responds to something you have strong feelings about.

474
00:34:28,140 --> 00:34:31,470
I merely want to help you find...

475
00:34:31,510 --> 00:34:34,950
the best way to look within yourselves...

476
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:39,080
the best key to your particular lock.

477
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:43,550
And it looks like we have some really interesting work up here.

478
00:34:43,590 --> 00:34:44,750
Thanks.

479
00:34:47,030 --> 00:34:50,620
What can you tell us about your piece...

480
00:34:50,660 --> 00:34:52,150
Phillip?

481
00:34:54,570 --> 00:34:58,370
It's about The Mutilator.

482
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:01,170
My goodness.

483
00:35:01,210 --> 00:35:03,200
It's a really great video game...

484
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:05,800
about a guy who kills people with a big hammer.

485
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:10,370
Oh. I thought maybe this was supposed to be your father.

486
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:16,790
What can you tell us about this piece..

487
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:18,720
- Enid.
- Enid.

488
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:23,420
Well, it's kind of a diary,
I guess.

489
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:26,130
Colorful.

490
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:41,810
I think that Phillip and Enid can help us to see that...

491
00:35:41,850 --> 00:35:44,780
there are many different ways we can express ourselves.

492
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:49,220
We can do things like these cartoons that are amusing...

493
00:35:49,250 --> 00:35:51,550
as a sort of a light entertainment...

494
00:35:51,590 --> 00:35:54,820
or we can do work that is more serious...

495
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:57,690
in scope, in feeling, and that deals with issues--

496
00:35:57,730 --> 00:36:01,500
emotional, spiritual, political...

497
00:36:01,530 --> 00:36:04,020
of great importance.

498
00:36:04,070 --> 00:36:06,730
Who is responsible for this?

499
00:36:06,770 --> 00:36:08,240
I am.

500
00:36:08,270 --> 00:36:10,040
Talk to us about it.

501
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:14,510
It's my response to the issue of a woman's right to choose.

502
00:36:14,550 --> 00:36:17,380
It's something I feel super strongly about.

503
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:21,720
Isn't this a wonderful piece, class?

504
00:36:21,750 --> 00:36:27,450
This definitely falls into that higher category of art...

505
00:36:27,490 --> 00:36:28,890
I was speaking of earlier.

506
00:36:31,930 --> 00:36:35,490
In a world where nothing is what it seems...

507
00:36:35,530 --> 00:36:38,590
in a time of uncertainty...

508
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:40,760
the future is about to be placed...

509
00:36:40,810 --> 00:36:42,710
Hello. Welcome to Masterpiece Video.

510
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:44,330
How may I help you this afternoon, sir?

511
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:46,540
I'm looking for a copy of "8 1/2."

512
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:48,440
Is that a new release, sir?

513
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:50,780
No. It's the classic Italian film.

514
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:52,310
Yes, sir.

515
00:36:52,350 --> 00:36:54,550
I'll just check that on the computer for you, sir.

516
00:36:58,820 --> 00:37:00,810
Hello! How are you young ladies this afternoon?

517
00:37:00,860 --> 00:37:03,660
May I help you find a particular Masterpiece movie?

518
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:04,990
No.

519
00:37:05,030 --> 00:37:06,260
Yes, here it is.

520
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:08,890
"9 1/2 Weeks" with Mickey Rourke.

521
00:37:08,930 --> 00:37:12,130
That would be in the erotic drama section.

522
00:37:12,170 --> 00:37:17,010
No, not "9 1/2," "8 1/2." The Fellini film.

523
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:18,940
How about this one?

524
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:20,540
Forget it. I'm sure it sucks.

525
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:21,740
All these movies suck.

526
00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:26,480
America's top critics agree--

527
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:28,540
"The Flower That Drank The Moon..."

528
00:37:28,590 --> 00:37:30,750
Let's get out of here. This place makes me sick.

529
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:32,920
We have to do something fun tonight.

530
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:36,050
It's my last weekend of freedom before I start my stupid job.

531
00:37:37,330 --> 00:37:38,760
I know a party we could go to later.

532
00:37:40,230 --> 00:37:42,890
Really? Where?

533
00:37:42,930 --> 00:37:45,030
It's a surprise.

534
00:37:48,370 --> 00:37:50,340
Some records I will pay serious money for...

535
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:53,310
provided that they're a sincere V-plus.

536
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:55,740
Other than that, I just prefer to have them on CD.

537
00:37:55,780 --> 00:37:59,650
But CDs will never have the presence of an original 78.

538
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:02,210
Wrong. A digital transfer, adequately mastered...

539
00:38:02,250 --> 00:38:03,740
will sound identical to the original.

540
00:38:03,790 --> 00:38:05,810
Do you have a decent equalizer?

541
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:09,160
- I have a Klipsch 2B3.
- Obviously the problem.

542
00:38:09,190 --> 00:38:11,060
You expect a ten-band equalizer...

543
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:12,890
to impart state-of-the-art sound?

544
00:38:12,930 --> 00:38:15,700
Dream a little dream. It's never gonna happen.

545
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:20,430
I totally, totally hate you.

546
00:38:20,470 --> 00:38:22,770
Come on. This is a fun party.

547
00:38:27,550 --> 00:38:29,710
Erskine Hawkins and his orchestra, do you have that?

548
00:38:29,750 --> 00:38:31,580
That's nice, but no.

549
00:38:33,450 --> 00:38:35,890
- "Golden Wedding"?
- Oh, I know that.

550
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:38,000
That's excellent.

551
00:38:38,140 --> 00:38:41,330
What's the story with the two cheerleaders over there?

552
00:38:41,370 --> 00:38:43,200
They're Seymour's.

553
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:46,510
Seymour? No. You got to be kidding me.

554
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:48,980
Don't worry about it. I've lived with the guy for five years.

555
00:38:49,010 --> 00:38:52,570
He's not getting any. Neither are you.

556
00:38:52,620 --> 00:38:54,950
Hey, you know what? Listen to me, Joe, all right?

557
00:38:54,990 --> 00:38:57,320
Let me tell you something, Joe, OK?

558
00:38:57,360 --> 00:39:00,220
You can't score a home run without swinging the bat.

559
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:03,460
All right? Physically impossible.

560
00:39:03,490 --> 00:39:05,190
Watch and learn, padre.

561
00:39:08,870 --> 00:39:10,460
How's it going, Adam?

562
00:39:12,340 --> 00:39:14,330
There's a seat right there.

563
00:39:14,370 --> 00:39:17,470
- Mind if I sit down?
- Yes.

564
00:39:17,510 --> 00:39:20,000
Oh, man. That was cold.

565
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:21,770
You're all right.

566
00:39:21,810 --> 00:39:23,210
You're pretty sharp.

567
00:39:23,250 --> 00:39:26,650
You're wearing a green dress. What are you, lrish?

568
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:28,780
I bet you're Irish. What's your name?

569
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:31,980
- Melorra.
- Ah, Melorra.

570
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:34,360
So listen to me, Melorra.

571
00:39:34,390 --> 00:39:36,660
Let me tell you something.

572
00:39:36,690 --> 00:39:38,460
You seem like an interesting chick.

573
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:41,730
What are you doing hanging here with all these losers?

574
00:39:41,770 --> 00:39:45,790
What do you say you and me go hit some night spots?

575
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:50,070
Well, Melorra, I'll be right back.

576
00:39:50,110 --> 00:39:51,300
I'm gonna get a beer.

577
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:54,040
No, Enid, wait.

578
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:55,910
Hey, that's all right.

579
00:40:00,150 --> 00:40:03,380
It has a large center hole and a hair crack.

580
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:06,750
But the crack is so tight, it's completely inaudible.

581
00:40:06,790 --> 00:40:10,630
But a tight hair crack is just that--a crack.

582
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:13,030
I don't collect cracked records.

583
00:40:13,060 --> 00:40:16,660
I only pay premium on mint records.

584
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:19,760
Seymour, you know that. Please.

585
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:27,670
So, what was all that about enlarged holes and tight cracks?

586
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:32,240
I didn't think you would have any interest...

587
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:33,410
in this get-together.

588
00:40:33,450 --> 00:40:34,610
If you would have told me you were coming...

589
00:40:34,650 --> 00:40:38,320
I would have warned you it's not like a real party or anything.

590
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:40,520
You're right about that.

591
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:43,190
So, is this your record collection?

592
00:40:43,230 --> 00:40:46,060
God, no. This is just junk I have for sale.

593
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:49,330
- The record room is off limits.
- Really?

594
00:40:52,970 --> 00:40:54,490
Here.

595
00:41:00,310 --> 00:41:02,210
Are all these records?

596
00:41:02,250 --> 00:41:05,880
I've got about 1,500 78s at this point.

597
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:07,580
I've tried to pare down my collection...

598
00:41:07,620 --> 00:41:08,920
to just the essential.

599
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:16,280
Look at this room.

600
00:41:18,660 --> 00:41:20,720
This is, like, my dream room.

601
00:41:23,130 --> 00:41:24,860
Look at all this stuff.

602
00:41:28,540 --> 00:41:30,670
You are, like, the luckiest guy in the world.

603
00:41:31,810 --> 00:41:33,800
I would kill to have stuff like this.

604
00:41:33,850 --> 00:41:36,310
Please. Go ahead and kill me.

605
00:41:36,350 --> 00:41:39,040
Oh, come on. What are you talking about?

606
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:42,180
You think it's healthy to obsessively collect things?

607
00:41:42,220 --> 00:41:44,380
You can't connect with other people...

608
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:46,450
so you fill your life with stuff.

609
00:41:46,490 --> 00:41:50,190
I'm just like all the rest of these pathetic collector losers.

610
00:41:50,230 --> 00:41:53,600
No, you're not. You're a cool guy, Seymour.

611
00:41:53,630 --> 00:41:58,800
Then how come I haven't had a girlfriend in four years?

612
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:00,800
I can't even remember the last time a girl talked to me.

613
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:02,530
I'm talking to you.

614
00:42:02,570 --> 00:42:04,060
You know, I bet there are tons of women...

615
00:42:04,110 --> 00:42:05,670
who'd go out with you in a minute.

616
00:42:05,710 --> 00:42:07,700
I know I could get you a date in, like, two seconds.

617
00:42:07,750 --> 00:42:08,970
Good luck.

618
00:42:09,010 --> 00:42:10,910
I mean it. You leave everything to me...

619
00:42:10,950 --> 00:42:13,180
I'm going to be your own personal dating service.

620
00:42:13,220 --> 00:42:14,840
Yeah, well, we should get back.

621
00:42:14,890 --> 00:42:16,080
By the end of this summer...

622
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:17,820
you're going to be up to your neck in pussy.

623
00:42:17,860 --> 00:42:19,760
Jesus.

624
00:42:19,860 --> 00:42:23,380
What about her? Would you go out with her?

625
00:42:23,430 --> 00:42:25,050
What kind of a question is that?

626
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:28,290
It's totally irrelevant, because a girl like that...

627
00:42:28,330 --> 00:42:29,800
would never be caught dead with me.

628
00:42:29,830 --> 00:42:31,360
Yeah, but put that aside for now.

629
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:33,170
Would you go out with her?

630
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:34,400
I really didn't get a good look at her.

631
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:37,370
Yes, you did. Whoa.

632
00:42:37,410 --> 00:42:39,840
What about her? Are you into girls with big tits?

633
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:41,670
Jesus.

634
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:45,950
I mean, as long as she's not a complete imbecile...

635
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:49,610
and she's even remotely attractive...

636
00:42:49,650 --> 00:42:52,450
Hey, look, there's Norman. Hi, Norman.

637
00:42:55,090 --> 00:42:56,820
We need to find a place where you can go...

638
00:42:56,860 --> 00:42:59,330
to meet women who share your interests.

639
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:01,800
Maybe I don't want to meet someone who shares my interests.

640
00:43:01,830 --> 00:43:03,630
I hate my interests.

641
00:43:03,670 --> 00:43:07,540
List your five main interests in order of importance.

642
00:43:07,570 --> 00:43:11,510
I'd have to put traditional jazz, blues...

643
00:43:11,540 --> 00:43:13,270
and then ragtime at the top of the list.

644
00:43:13,310 --> 00:43:15,470
Right, so let's just say music.

645
00:43:15,510 --> 00:43:17,850
That way, we only use up one.

646
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:19,870
All right.

647
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:22,910
Can we go in here for a second? Just for a second.

648
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:31,330
Just stopping by to say hi.

649
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:35,930
This is my friend Seymour.

650
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:42,940
OK. Well, we'll see you later, Josh.

651
00:43:42,970 --> 00:43:44,340
Josh, what you goddamn doing?

652
00:43:44,380 --> 00:43:48,240
Clean up that fucking mess! Jesus.

653
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:50,980
So, was that your boyfriend?

654
00:43:51,020 --> 00:43:53,010
Josh? He's nobody's boyfriend.

655
00:43:53,050 --> 00:43:55,780
He's just this guy that Becky and I like to torture.

656
00:43:55,820 --> 00:43:57,980
But do you... Are you going out--

657
00:43:58,020 --> 00:44:01,480
Oh, my God. We have to go in here. Come on.

658
00:44:01,530 --> 00:44:02,860
Yeah, sure. Very funny.

659
00:44:02,890 --> 00:44:04,520
Come on. Please?

660
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:06,360
Becky and I have been dying to go in here...

661
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:07,990
but we can never find any boys to take us.

662
00:44:08,030 --> 00:44:10,630
- I would really rather not.
- Come on. Please?

663
00:44:10,670 --> 00:44:12,190
Just for a minute. It'll be a riot.

664
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:15,330
- I don't think so.
- Please. Please.

665
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:32,890
Oh, my God. Look at all these creeps.

666
00:44:34,890 --> 00:44:36,990
OK. Can we go?

667
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:40,960
This place is a total riot.

668
00:44:48,570 --> 00:44:50,940
What are you doing?

669
00:44:50,980 --> 00:44:53,240
Oh, my God.

670
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:56,770
Who would actually have sex with this thing?

671
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:03,720
"Corporate Slut." Sophisticated.

672
00:45:03,750 --> 00:45:05,190
Come on. Can we go?

673
00:45:06,690 --> 00:45:09,890
Seymour, you have to lend me the money to buy this.

674
00:45:12,660 --> 00:45:14,460
I don't really have a lot of money on me right now.

675
00:45:14,500 --> 00:45:16,430
Come on, Seymour. Please?

676
00:45:16,470 --> 00:45:18,440
I don't want this showing up on a credit card statement.

677
00:45:18,470 --> 00:45:19,770
I'll get put on some weird mailing list.

678
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:22,740
- It's not that much.
- That's not the point.

679
00:45:22,770 --> 00:45:25,050
Gimme all your money, bitch.

680
00:45:25,180 --> 00:45:26,550
Where did you get that?

681
00:45:26,580 --> 00:45:29,280
You'll never believe it. Guess.

682
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:31,810
Where?

683
00:45:31,850 --> 00:45:34,080
Anthony's.

684
00:45:34,120 --> 00:45:35,350
No way. When?

685
00:45:35,390 --> 00:45:36,920
Just now. I went with Seymour.

686
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:38,620
You cunt.

687
00:45:38,660 --> 00:45:40,820
Excuse me.

688
00:45:40,860 --> 00:45:43,390
I can't read the trivia question.

689
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:49,940
"Where on the human body is the Douglas pouch located?"

690
00:45:54,940 --> 00:45:56,410
Oh, God.

691
00:46:02,620 --> 00:46:07,890
Slightly below the uterus on a female.

692
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:17,130
Wow.

693
00:46:17,170 --> 00:46:19,000
He does that every single day.

694
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:22,530
I'll have a decaf-mocha to go.

695
00:46:22,570 --> 00:46:25,060
One decaf-mocha.

696
00:46:25,110 --> 00:46:26,230
Can I get you--

697
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:28,040
No, I do not want a biscotti with that.

698
00:46:31,380 --> 00:46:35,040
God. How can you stand all these assholes?

699
00:46:35,080 --> 00:46:36,920
Some people are OK...

700
00:46:36,950 --> 00:46:39,150
but mostly I just feel like poisoning everybody.

701
00:46:39,190 --> 00:46:41,950
At least the wheelchair guy is entertaining.

702
00:46:41,990 --> 00:46:43,480
He doesn't even need that wheelchair.

703
00:46:43,530 --> 00:46:45,120
He's just totally lazy.

704
00:46:45,160 --> 00:46:46,820
That rules.

705
00:46:46,860 --> 00:46:50,630
No, it really doesn't. You'll see.

706
00:46:50,670 --> 00:46:51,930
You'll get totally sick of all the creeps...

707
00:46:51,970 --> 00:46:54,400
and losers and weirdos.

708
00:46:54,440 --> 00:46:56,170
But those are our people.

709
00:46:56,210 --> 00:46:58,110
Yeah, well.

710
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:02,770
So, when are you going to get a job?

711
00:47:05,580 --> 00:47:09,020
I'm working on it. Got a few leads.

712
00:47:09,050 --> 00:47:11,680
Don't worry about it. I'll get a job next week.

713
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:14,590
God, I can't believe you went to Anthony's without me.

714
00:47:19,530 --> 00:47:20,830
Oh, sweetie.

715
00:47:20,860 --> 00:47:23,330
Honey, would you come in here for a minute?

716
00:47:26,470 --> 00:47:28,840
Sweetie, you remember Maxine?

717
00:47:37,380 --> 00:47:38,870
I'm going to go to bed. I'm really tired.

718
00:47:38,910 --> 00:47:42,320
Honey, I made spaghetti. You don't want some?

719
00:47:42,350 --> 00:47:44,650
No. I have to get up early for class tomorrow.

720
00:47:44,690 --> 00:47:47,780
It's really quite something to see you all grown up, Enid.

721
00:47:51,360 --> 00:47:52,550
I'd love to know what you're doing now.

722
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:54,690
I can't help but feel...

723
00:47:54,730 --> 00:47:57,160
I had some small part in how you turned out.

724
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:02,230
What are you studying?

725
00:48:02,270 --> 00:48:04,240
You were always such a smart little girl.

726
00:48:06,110 --> 00:48:08,800
I'm taking a remedial high school art class...

727
00:48:08,840 --> 00:48:10,240
for fuck-ups and retards.

728
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:16,980
Who is this, Enid?

729
00:48:17,020 --> 00:48:18,510
It's supposed to be Don Knotts.

730
00:48:18,550 --> 00:48:23,150
And what was your reason for choosing him as your subject?

731
00:48:24,790 --> 00:48:27,420
I don't know. I just like Don Knotts.

732
00:48:28,830 --> 00:48:30,490
Interesting.

733
00:48:30,530 --> 00:48:33,730
What do we have here, Margaret?

734
00:48:33,770 --> 00:48:36,030
It's a tampon in a teacup.

735
00:48:36,070 --> 00:48:38,540
I can see that.

736
00:48:38,570 --> 00:48:39,870
What can you tell us about it?

737
00:48:39,910 --> 00:48:42,900
First of all, what kind of sculpture is this?

738
00:48:42,950 --> 00:48:45,040
It's a found object.

739
00:48:45,080 --> 00:48:47,340
That's where an artist takes an ordinary object...

740
00:48:47,380 --> 00:48:49,210
and places it in an artistic context...

741
00:48:49,250 --> 00:48:50,380
and thus, it becomes art.

742
00:48:50,420 --> 00:48:52,440
But what can you tell us about it...

743
00:48:52,490 --> 00:48:55,120
in regard to your artistic intent?

744
00:48:55,160 --> 00:49:01,320
Well, I guess I see the teacup as a symbol for womanhood.

745
00:49:01,360 --> 00:49:03,700
Such as tea parties in the olden days...

746
00:49:03,730 --> 00:49:05,060
but instead of tea...

747
00:49:05,100 --> 00:49:08,190
I was trying to kind of confront people with this--

748
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:12,040
This shocking image of repressed femininity.

749
00:49:12,070 --> 00:49:14,130
Right. Exactly.

750
00:49:14,180 --> 00:49:17,110
Well, I think it's a really wonderful piece...

751
00:49:17,150 --> 00:49:20,010
and it illustrates perfectly what I was saying...

752
00:49:20,050 --> 00:49:25,950
about not being afraid to use controversial imagery.

753
00:49:25,990 --> 00:49:30,250
Oh. Well, this looks like the work of Phillip.

754
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:37,730
Hey, you see that guy over there?

755
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:42,490
- Which one?
- The blond guy over there.

756
00:49:45,140 --> 00:49:47,440
He gives me, like, a total boner.

757
00:49:47,480 --> 00:49:50,410
He's, like, the biggest idiot of all time.

758
00:49:50,450 --> 00:49:51,910
You guys up for some reggae tonight?

759
00:49:53,480 --> 00:49:55,180
OK, you're right.

760
00:49:57,650 --> 00:49:58,980
Sometimes I think I'm going crazy...

761
00:49:59,020 --> 00:50:00,780
from sexual frustration.

762
00:50:00,820 --> 00:50:04,020
And you haven't heard of the miracle of masturbation?

763
00:50:08,900 --> 00:50:10,420
Heads up.

764
00:50:13,900 --> 00:50:15,200
My band's playing here on Friday night...

765
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:19,300
and there's going to be a bunch of cool bands playing...

766
00:50:19,340 --> 00:50:21,870
and you don't have to pay...

767
00:50:21,910 --> 00:50:23,210
if you show them this flier at the door.

768
00:50:24,350 --> 00:50:25,970
You should come check it out.

769
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:30,640
Which band is yours?

770
00:50:30,690 --> 00:50:32,950
It's Alien Autopsy.

771
00:50:32,990 --> 00:50:35,290
Oh. Bitchin'.

772
00:50:35,320 --> 00:50:38,050
Yeah, well...

773
00:50:38,090 --> 00:50:39,220
maybe I'll see you there.

774
00:50:39,260 --> 00:50:41,490
Yeah. Thanks.

775
00:50:44,730 --> 00:50:46,130
God, what a dork.

776
00:50:46,170 --> 00:50:47,900
You're just jealous.

777
00:50:47,940 --> 00:50:49,840
Trust me, at this point, I'm past the fact...

778
00:50:49,870 --> 00:50:52,170
that every single guy likes you better than me.

779
00:50:52,210 --> 00:50:53,870
Oh, face it. You just hate every single guy...

780
00:50:53,910 --> 00:50:55,170
on the face of the earth.

781
00:50:55,210 --> 00:50:57,240
That's not true.

782
00:50:57,280 --> 00:51:00,650
I just hate all these extroverted, obnoxious...

783
00:51:00,680 --> 00:51:03,080
pseudo-bohemian losers.

784
00:51:03,120 --> 00:51:06,350
The Donnie G show. Donnie G!

785
00:51:06,390 --> 00:51:08,720
Nothing but classic rock...

786
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:10,120
coming at you this beautiful evening.

787
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:12,220
You're listening to KFTO--

788
00:51:12,260 --> 00:51:15,130
God, that asshole's voice is so hateful.

789
00:51:15,160 --> 00:51:16,830
No wonder I never listen to the radio.

790
00:51:16,870 --> 00:51:18,990
Relax, Seymour. Relax.

791
00:51:19,030 --> 00:51:22,470
He's just so shrill and loud and piercing.

792
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:25,100
I feel like I'm being jabbed in the face.

793
00:51:25,140 --> 00:51:28,340
"KTO coming at you on this beautiful evening."

794
00:51:28,380 --> 00:51:29,840
- So...
- Thank you.

795
00:51:33,220 --> 00:51:34,910
Why'd you bring the record?

796
00:51:34,950 --> 00:51:37,180
I brought it so he can autograph it.

797
00:51:37,220 --> 00:51:38,550
He's going to be amazed to see it.

798
00:51:38,590 --> 00:51:41,680
It's one of only two known copies.

799
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:43,520
I can't believe they have him as the opening act...

800
00:51:43,560 --> 00:51:44,790
and not the headliner.

801
00:51:44,830 --> 00:51:47,460
It's--What an insult.

802
00:51:47,500 --> 00:51:50,660
There's gonna be lots of girls to pick from at this bar.

803
00:51:51,800 --> 00:51:54,500
I'm not holding my breath in that department.

804
00:52:05,910 --> 00:52:07,880
What, are we in slow motion here?

805
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:09,680
What are you, hypnotized?

806
00:52:09,720 --> 00:52:11,580
Have some more kids, why don't you?

807
00:52:11,620 --> 00:52:13,750
Jesus Christ, move it!

808
00:52:13,790 --> 00:52:15,770
Seymour! God.

809
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:21,470
I can't believe these people.

810
00:52:21,510 --> 00:52:23,500
They could at least turn off their stupid sports game...

811
00:52:23,550 --> 00:52:24,910
until he's done playing.

812
00:52:36,630 --> 00:52:38,620
Thank you.

813
00:52:38,660 --> 00:52:39,860
Don't go away.

814
00:52:39,900 --> 00:52:42,230
We got Blues Hammer coming up in just a minute.

815
00:52:42,270 --> 00:52:44,100
Hey, check that out.

816
00:52:47,670 --> 00:52:50,470
She's nice, but, you know...

817
00:52:50,510 --> 00:52:52,770
Offer her a seat.

818
00:52:52,810 --> 00:52:54,110
- I'll do it.
- No, no, no, no.

819
00:52:54,150 --> 00:52:57,600
Wait. Let me think of something to say to her first.

820
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:20,030
That was great music, huh?

821
00:53:20,070 --> 00:53:22,160
Yeah, I just love blues.

822
00:53:22,210 --> 00:53:27,940
Actually, technically, what he was mostly playing...

823
00:53:27,980 --> 00:53:31,440
would more accurately be classified in the ragtime idiom.

824
00:53:31,480 --> 00:53:34,180
Although, of course, not in the strictest sense...

825
00:53:34,220 --> 00:53:39,420
of the classical ragtime piano music...

826
00:53:39,460 --> 00:53:44,050
like that of Scott Joplin or Joseph Lamb.

827
00:53:44,100 --> 00:53:47,500
Authentic blues has a more conventional...

828
00:53:47,530 --> 00:53:50,430
twelve-bar structure in its stanzas.

829
00:53:50,470 --> 00:53:53,460
Oh. If you like authentic blues...

830
00:53:53,500 --> 00:53:55,840
you really gotta check out Blues Hammer.

831
00:53:55,870 --> 00:53:57,430
They're so great.

832
00:54:50,130 --> 00:54:53,290
All right, people, are you ready to boogie?

833
00:54:53,330 --> 00:54:55,300
'Cause we gonna play some authentic...

834
00:54:55,330 --> 00:54:57,730
way-down-in-the-delta blues.

835
00:54:57,770 --> 00:55:00,460
So get ready to rock your world!

836
00:55:08,310 --> 00:55:11,440
Well, I been plowin' behind the mule, son

837
00:55:11,480 --> 00:55:13,610
Picking cotton all day long

838
00:55:16,390 --> 00:55:19,820
Yes, I been plowin'

839
00:55:19,860 --> 00:55:22,380
Picking cotton all day long

840
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:27,720
I said, Lordy, baby

841
00:55:27,770 --> 00:55:30,390
But my woman she be gone

842
00:55:37,210 --> 00:55:40,740
Now I remember why I haven't been anywhere in months.

843
00:55:40,780 --> 00:55:42,180
It's simple for everybody else.

844
00:55:42,210 --> 00:55:44,880
You give them a Big Mac and a pair of Nikes...

845
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:46,040
and they're happy.

846
00:55:46,080 --> 00:55:49,350
I can't relate to ninety-nine percent of humanity.

847
00:55:49,390 --> 00:55:51,410
I can't relate to humanity, either...

848
00:55:51,460 --> 00:55:53,290
but I don't think it's completely hopeless.

849
00:55:53,320 --> 00:55:56,590
Well, it's not completely hopeless for you.

850
00:55:56,630 --> 00:55:58,120
I'm not even in the same universe...

851
00:55:58,160 --> 00:55:59,930
as those creatures back there.

852
00:55:59,960 --> 00:56:01,090
We just need to find you a place...

853
00:56:01,130 --> 00:56:02,260
where you can meet someone...

854
00:56:02,300 --> 00:56:04,430
who isn't a complete idiot, that's all.

855
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:08,940
Why do you care so much if I get a date or not?

856
00:56:08,970 --> 00:56:11,410
I don't know.

857
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:13,140
I guess I just can't stand the idea of a world...

858
00:56:13,180 --> 00:56:15,040
where a guy like you can't get a date.

859
00:56:22,050 --> 00:56:23,710
What is this, Seymour?

860
00:56:25,860 --> 00:56:28,150
Oh, that.

861
00:56:28,190 --> 00:56:30,020
I borrowed that from work about fifteen years ago.

862
00:56:30,060 --> 00:56:31,930
I guess it's mine now.

863
00:56:31,960 --> 00:56:33,790
What are you, a Klansman or something?

864
00:56:35,230 --> 00:56:37,330
Yeah, I'm a Klansman.

865
00:56:38,700 --> 00:56:40,670
You know the Cook's Chicken franchise?

866
00:56:42,170 --> 00:56:43,500
"Four-piece Cook's special...

867
00:56:43,540 --> 00:56:47,410
"deep-fried with side and slaw. It's outrageous!"

868
00:56:47,450 --> 00:56:50,900
Yeah, well, Cook's is just a made up name.

869
00:56:52,450 --> 00:56:53,920
Back in 1922...

870
00:56:53,950 --> 00:56:56,110
they were originally called Coon Chicken lnn.

871
00:56:56,150 --> 00:56:58,310
That's an early painting of their first logo.

872
00:57:22,250 --> 00:57:24,650
How come everybody doesn't know this?

873
00:57:24,680 --> 00:57:26,270
It's ancient history.

874
00:57:26,320 --> 00:57:29,410
Same reason nobody knows about this Lionel Belasco record.

875
00:57:29,450 --> 00:57:32,910
I was more interested in the whole Cook's phenomenon...

876
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:35,360
when I was about your age.

877
00:57:35,390 --> 00:57:37,660
Sort of lost interest when I started working for them.

878
00:57:39,100 --> 00:57:41,030
You work for Cook's Chicken?

879
00:57:42,670 --> 00:57:44,070
For nineteen years.

880
00:57:44,100 --> 00:57:46,630
Were you a fry cook or something?

881
00:57:46,670 --> 00:57:49,700
Nothing so glamorous, actually.

882
00:57:49,740 --> 00:57:53,200
I'm an assistant manager at their corporate headquarters.

883
00:57:53,240 --> 00:57:56,240
Jesus. I'd go nuts if I had to work in an office all day.

884
00:57:59,980 --> 00:58:01,470
So I don't really get it.

885
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:03,540
Are you saying that things were better back then...

886
00:58:03,590 --> 00:58:05,050
even though there was stuff like this?

887
00:58:05,090 --> 00:58:08,580
I suppose things are better now, but...

888
00:58:08,630 --> 00:58:10,060
I don't know, it's complicated.

889
00:58:10,090 --> 00:58:11,220
People still hate each other...

890
00:58:11,260 --> 00:58:13,860
but they just know how to hide it better.

891
00:58:15,500 --> 00:58:17,430
Can I borrow this?

892
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:19,760
For what?

893
00:58:19,800 --> 00:58:21,240
I promise I'll take good care of it.

894
00:58:21,270 --> 00:58:23,740
They're very sensitive about that kind of stuff at work.

895
00:58:25,340 --> 00:58:28,110
Don't you trust me, Seymour?

896
00:58:29,080 --> 00:58:32,640
Let's address discussion to this piece.

897
00:58:34,650 --> 00:58:35,980
I don't like it.

898
00:58:36,020 --> 00:58:38,250
Can you tell us why?

899
00:58:38,290 --> 00:58:41,020
I don't know.

900
00:58:41,060 --> 00:58:42,960
I think it's totally weird.

901
00:58:42,990 --> 00:58:44,820
It's totally offensive.

902
00:58:44,860 --> 00:58:46,090
Yeah. I agree.

903
00:58:46,130 --> 00:58:47,290
It's not right.

904
00:58:47,330 --> 00:58:50,490
Well, these are all valid comments, but...

905
00:58:50,530 --> 00:58:52,090
I think we should see if the artist...

906
00:58:52,140 --> 00:58:53,970
has anything to bring to this.

907
00:58:55,940 --> 00:58:59,240
Well, I found this when I was doing some research...

908
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:02,340
and I discovered that Cook's Chicken...

909
00:59:02,380 --> 00:59:04,750
used to be called Coon Chicken.

910
00:59:04,780 --> 00:59:08,510
So I decided to do my project based on this discovery...

911
00:59:08,550 --> 00:59:12,550
as kind of a comment on racism...

912
00:59:12,590 --> 00:59:14,990
and how it's whitewashed over in our culture.

913
00:59:15,030 --> 00:59:17,290
Did you actually do this painting?

914
00:59:17,330 --> 00:59:22,420
Well, no, it's more of a found art object.

915
00:59:22,470 --> 00:59:25,870
How do you think this addresses the subject of racism?

916
00:59:25,900 --> 00:59:28,130
It's complicated.

917
00:59:28,170 --> 00:59:29,700
I guess I'm trying to show...

918
00:59:29,740 --> 00:59:32,400
how racism used to be more out in the open...

919
00:59:32,440 --> 00:59:35,380
and now it's hidden or something.

920
00:59:35,410 --> 00:59:37,710
And how do you think an image like this...

921
00:59:37,750 --> 00:59:39,340
helps us to see that?

922
00:59:39,380 --> 00:59:43,180
I'm not sure.

923
00:59:44,690 --> 00:59:48,490
I guess because when we see something like this...

924
00:59:48,530 --> 00:59:50,290
it seems really shocking.

925
00:59:50,330 --> 00:59:55,180
And we have to wonder why it's so shocking.

926
00:59:59,160 --> 01:00:01,280
I don't really know what to say, Enid.

927
01:00:05,500 --> 01:00:07,400
I think it's a remarkable achievement.

928
01:00:11,630 --> 01:00:14,230
I'm going to let you handle the 4:30 crowd by yourself.

929
01:00:14,270 --> 01:00:16,860
That way, I can evaluate your performance while it's slow.

930
01:00:16,910 --> 01:00:18,810
Then we'll ease you into the big crowds, all right?

931
01:00:18,840 --> 01:00:21,040
- You can count on me, sir.
- Cool.

932
01:00:24,880 --> 01:00:29,150
Do you serve beer or any alcohol?

933
01:00:29,190 --> 01:00:30,950
I wish.

934
01:00:30,990 --> 01:00:32,720
Actually, you wish.

935
01:00:32,760 --> 01:00:34,590
After about five minutes of this movie...

936
01:00:34,620 --> 01:00:36,560
you're going to wish you had ten beers.

937
01:00:43,970 --> 01:00:47,490
What are you doing? You don't ever criticize the feature.

938
01:00:47,540 --> 01:00:48,830
Why? What's the difference?

939
01:00:48,870 --> 01:00:51,810
I mean, we already got his money.

940
01:00:51,840 --> 01:00:53,900
Look, that's the policy, OK?

941
01:00:53,940 --> 01:00:55,570
If you want to make up your own rules...

942
01:00:55,610 --> 01:00:57,940
open up your own theater.

943
01:01:00,450 --> 01:01:02,940
And let me have lots of butter on it.

944
01:01:15,260 --> 01:01:16,390
Here you go.

945
01:01:16,430 --> 01:01:19,130
Smothered in delicious yellow chemical sludge.

946
01:01:23,770 --> 01:01:25,710
What the hell is wrong with you?

947
01:01:26,840 --> 01:01:28,240
What?

948
01:01:28,280 --> 01:01:30,110
I was just joking around with the customers.

949
01:01:30,150 --> 01:01:32,640
- It's my shtick.
- Well, lose it.

950
01:01:32,680 --> 01:01:35,010
And why aren't you pushing the larger sizes?

951
01:01:35,050 --> 01:01:37,210
Didn't you get training about up-sizing?

952
01:01:37,250 --> 01:01:40,220
Yeah, but I feel really weird.

953
01:01:40,260 --> 01:01:41,780
It's pretty sleazy.

954
01:01:43,960 --> 01:01:46,260
It's not optional!

955
01:01:49,800 --> 01:01:51,990
Jesus.

956
01:01:52,040 --> 01:01:54,970
Hi. Can I get a medium 7 Up?

957
01:01:56,240 --> 01:01:58,300
Medium?

958
01:01:58,340 --> 01:02:02,070
Why, sir, do you not know that for a mere 25 cents more...

959
01:02:02,110 --> 01:02:04,080
you could purchase a large beverage?

960
01:02:04,110 --> 01:02:07,050
And you know, I'm only telling you this...

961
01:02:07,080 --> 01:02:08,950
because we're such good friends.

962
01:02:08,990 --> 01:02:10,420
Medium is really only for suckers...

963
01:02:10,450 --> 01:02:12,610
who don't know the concept of value.

964
01:02:12,660 --> 01:02:15,450
What are you talking about?

965
01:02:15,490 --> 01:02:17,930
What kind of loser gets fired after one day?

966
01:02:17,960 --> 01:02:20,950
Look, I told you. The manager was a total asshole.

967
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,090
I'll get another job.

968
01:02:23,130 --> 01:02:26,100
Besides, I have some ideas to make money in the meantime.

969
01:02:30,640 --> 01:02:33,270
I can't believe you're selling some of this stuff.

970
01:02:33,310 --> 01:02:36,280
Fuck it. Everything must go.

971
01:02:41,520 --> 01:02:44,040
I remember this hat.

972
01:02:44,090 --> 01:02:46,610
This was during your little old lady phase.

973
01:02:48,020 --> 01:02:49,510
How much is this?

974
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:56,790
That's not for sale.

975
01:02:56,830 --> 01:02:58,700
Wait a minute. It says five dollars.

976
01:02:58,740 --> 01:03:01,700
I know, it's...

977
01:03:01,740 --> 01:03:02,900
That's a mistake.

978
01:03:02,940 --> 01:03:04,840
I'm not selling it.

979
01:03:12,180 --> 01:03:13,710
What was that all about?

980
01:03:13,750 --> 01:03:15,150
I thought "everything must go."

981
01:03:15,180 --> 01:03:16,650
Yeah, right.

982
01:03:16,690 --> 01:03:20,920
Like I'd let some asshole with a soul patch own Goofy Gus.

983
01:03:22,460 --> 01:03:23,690
How much for this dress?

984
01:03:23,730 --> 01:03:26,390
God, I can't believe you're selling that.

985
01:03:30,670 --> 01:03:32,600
That's five hundred dollars.

986
01:03:32,640 --> 01:03:35,540
- What?
- Five hundred.

987
01:03:35,570 --> 01:03:38,600
You're crazy. It should be, like, two dollars.

988
01:03:38,640 --> 01:03:41,170
I was wearing that when I lost my virginity.

989
01:03:41,210 --> 01:03:43,410
Why do I care about that?

990
01:03:43,450 --> 01:03:45,140
Why do you want it?

991
01:03:45,180 --> 01:03:46,880
It would look stupid on you anyway.

992
01:03:46,920 --> 01:03:49,850
God! Fuck you!

993
01:03:52,890 --> 01:03:55,050
So, now are you going to get a regular job?

994
01:03:59,660 --> 01:04:01,390
Do you want to do something tonight?

995
01:04:01,430 --> 01:04:03,330
I can't. It's Seymour's birthday tonight.

996
01:04:03,370 --> 01:04:05,300
Oh, shit. What time is it?

997
01:04:05,330 --> 01:04:08,770
I'm supposed to go to the store. I was going to make him a cake.

998
01:04:08,810 --> 01:04:10,830
Do you still want to go shopping tomorrow?

999
01:04:10,870 --> 01:04:13,070
Yeah, I guess. Call me.

1000
01:04:21,080 --> 01:04:23,140
Since when can you make a cake?

1001
01:04:33,200 --> 01:04:35,190
OK, you can open your eyes now.

1002
01:04:37,670 --> 01:04:41,500
Oh, hey. Thanks, Enid. I really appreciate it.

1003
01:04:41,540 --> 01:04:43,600
No, blow it out, doofus.

1004
01:04:50,180 --> 01:04:53,110
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.

1005
01:04:53,150 --> 01:04:56,550
Oh, it's just my stupid back. I'll be all right in a minute.

1006
01:05:00,820 --> 01:05:02,790
What is that?

1007
01:05:04,030 --> 01:05:06,090
It's...

1008
01:05:06,130 --> 01:05:08,220
It's just this elastic thing I have to wear sometimes...

1009
01:05:08,260 --> 01:05:09,930
for lumbar support.

1010
01:05:09,970 --> 01:05:11,520
What, like a girdle?

1011
01:05:14,470 --> 01:05:17,300
Maybe now you can understand why I can't get a date.

1012
01:05:17,340 --> 01:05:19,670
Well, at least you're not the only one.

1013
01:05:19,710 --> 01:05:22,010
I think only stupid people have good relationships.

1014
01:05:23,410 --> 01:05:26,040
That's the spirit.

1015
01:05:26,080 --> 01:05:29,050
Actually, there is this one guy I have a crush on right now...

1016
01:05:29,090 --> 01:05:32,520
but... totally fucked-up situation.

1017
01:05:34,160 --> 01:05:35,710
Oh, yeah?

1018
01:05:35,760 --> 01:05:37,660
Yeah. You met him, remember? That guy Josh.

1019
01:05:37,690 --> 01:05:39,160
But I can't do anything about it...

1020
01:05:39,200 --> 01:05:41,360
because Becky would totally freak out.

1021
01:05:43,600 --> 01:05:44,830
Why?

1022
01:05:44,870 --> 01:05:46,860
Just forget it. It's complicated.

1023
01:05:51,940 --> 01:05:53,470
Aren't you going to get that?

1024
01:05:53,510 --> 01:05:55,100
Let the machine get it.

1025
01:05:55,140 --> 01:05:57,610
I have no desire to talk to anyone who might be calling me.

1026
01:06:01,950 --> 01:06:03,580
I knew it. It's my mother.

1027
01:06:05,450 --> 01:06:08,650
Hi, I'm calling for...

1028
01:06:08,690 --> 01:06:11,890
You placed an ad in "The Weekly" over a month ago, and...

1029
01:06:11,930 --> 01:06:14,760
well, I'm the blonde in the yellow dress.

1030
01:06:14,800 --> 01:06:16,560
At least, I think I am.

1031
01:06:16,600 --> 01:06:18,530
I saw the ad when you first placed it...

1032
01:06:18,570 --> 01:06:20,300
but I was in this relationship at the time...

1033
01:06:20,340 --> 01:06:22,330
so I cut the ad out, and...

1034
01:06:22,370 --> 01:06:24,900
and I'm not in a relationship anymore.

1035
01:06:24,940 --> 01:06:26,670
God, this is really confusing.

1036
01:06:26,710 --> 01:06:27,840
Don't!

1037
01:06:27,880 --> 01:06:29,500
Anyway, if you still want to talk to me...

1038
01:06:29,550 --> 01:06:33,170
I can be reached at 555-2673.

1039
01:06:33,220 --> 01:06:35,880
That's my work number...

1040
01:06:35,920 --> 01:06:39,010
and my name is Dana.

1041
01:06:39,060 --> 01:06:41,460
OK! Bye.

1042
01:06:43,790 --> 01:06:45,280
Wow.

1043
01:06:47,230 --> 01:06:48,390
What was all that about?

1044
01:06:48,430 --> 01:06:50,800
It's just somebody's idea of a joke.

1045
01:06:50,830 --> 01:06:52,990
That didn't sound like a joke to me.

1046
01:06:54,100 --> 01:06:58,250
What, did you place an ad in the personals or something?

1047
01:06:58,380 --> 01:07:01,610
Yeah, a long time ago.

1048
01:07:01,650 --> 01:07:05,420
She called before. It's just somebody trying to humiliate me.

1049
01:07:05,450 --> 01:07:07,850
I think you should call her back.

1050
01:07:16,770 --> 01:07:19,060
Oh, look. We have to get these.

1051
01:07:24,370 --> 01:07:27,670
You know, I can't afford stuff like this right now.

1052
01:07:27,710 --> 01:07:28,840
Look, I'm sick of waiting.

1053
01:07:28,880 --> 01:07:31,110
I mean, we have to get stuff if we're ever going to move.

1054
01:07:34,220 --> 01:07:36,120
Aren't these the greatest?

1055
01:07:39,560 --> 01:07:40,720
What? They're nice.

1056
01:07:42,590 --> 01:07:44,820
I can't imagine spending money on plastic cups.

1057
01:07:44,860 --> 01:07:47,560
You don't have to. I'll pay for everything now...

1058
01:07:47,600 --> 01:07:49,830
and you can pay me back when you finally get a job.

1059
01:07:49,870 --> 01:07:51,160
You're insane.

1060
01:07:51,200 --> 01:07:54,140
So, are we still going to that thing tonight?

1061
01:07:54,170 --> 01:07:55,600
What thing?

1062
01:07:55,640 --> 01:07:58,700
You know, that guy's band is playing tonight.

1063
01:07:58,740 --> 01:08:00,140
Alien Autopsy.

1064
01:08:00,180 --> 01:08:02,840
Actually, Seymour's big date is tonight.

1065
01:08:02,880 --> 01:08:04,610
And I kind of want to be around when he calls...

1066
01:08:04,650 --> 01:08:06,410
you know, so I can hear how badly it went.

1067
01:08:06,450 --> 01:08:08,610
God, I'm so sick of Seymour.

1068
01:08:13,760 --> 01:08:16,190
That was great.

1069
01:08:16,230 --> 01:08:18,280
Jeez, thanks a lot for cooking.

1070
01:08:18,330 --> 01:08:20,730
I love to cook.

1071
01:08:20,760 --> 01:08:25,630
Most women wouldn't invite a guy over on the first date, but...

1072
01:08:25,670 --> 01:08:27,900
I think you should trust your instincts.

1073
01:08:27,940 --> 01:08:29,100
When I talked to you on the phone...

1074
01:08:29,140 --> 01:08:33,300
you just seemed so... I don't know, so harmless.

1075
01:08:33,340 --> 01:08:34,830
Thanks.

1076
01:08:56,030 --> 01:08:57,520
I love this song.

1077
01:09:01,100 --> 01:09:02,260
Isn't it great?

1078
01:09:04,540 --> 01:09:06,600
Doesn't it make you want to dance?

1079
01:09:06,640 --> 01:09:09,080
- Come on.
- No, I don't really dance.

1080
01:09:09,110 --> 01:09:11,440
Come on, Seymour. Don't be silly.

1081
01:09:11,480 --> 01:09:13,210
Anybody can dance.

1082
01:09:13,250 --> 01:09:15,110
Here, follow me. Watch my feet.

1083
01:09:16,350 --> 01:09:17,580
No, really.

1084
01:09:17,620 --> 01:09:19,550
Come on, Seymour.

1085
01:09:19,590 --> 01:09:21,750
Just feel the music.

1086
01:09:21,790 --> 01:09:24,660
Loosen up. It's all in your head.

1087
01:09:24,690 --> 01:09:27,690
Here, let's put down your bowl of ice cream.

1088
01:09:27,730 --> 01:09:30,060
Wow, it's 9:00 already.

1089
01:09:30,100 --> 01:09:32,360
If we're gonna make that movie, don't you think we should go?

1090
01:09:32,400 --> 01:09:35,700
OK. Party pooper.

1091
01:09:50,290 --> 01:09:52,850
I'm so excited to see this film.

1092
01:09:52,890 --> 01:09:55,620
Dustoff Varnya is such a brilliant director.

1093
01:09:55,660 --> 01:09:57,090
Did you see his last film...

1094
01:09:57,130 --> 01:09:58,890
"The Flower That Drank The Moon"?

1095
01:09:58,930 --> 01:10:01,420
It was glorious.

1096
01:10:01,460 --> 01:10:03,730
Must have missed that one.

1097
01:10:03,770 --> 01:10:06,430
Then again, what do I know? I like Laurel and Hardy movies.

1098
01:10:06,470 --> 01:10:10,170
Really? I never really cared for those.

1099
01:10:10,210 --> 01:10:13,140
Why does the fat one always have to be so mean to the skinny one?

1100
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:33,830
- Hello?
- Hey. It's me.

1101
01:10:33,860 --> 01:10:37,360
- Oh, hi.
- So, what happened?

1102
01:10:37,400 --> 01:10:39,930
Actually, it's still kind of happening.

1103
01:10:39,970 --> 01:10:43,700
She's over here right now. I think it's going pretty well.

1104
01:10:43,740 --> 01:10:46,830
- What? You're joking.
- Yeah, so I better go.

1105
01:10:46,880 --> 01:10:48,640
It's not really the best time to talk, OK?

1106
01:10:48,680 --> 01:10:51,480
What, are you going to have sex with her on your first date?

1107
01:10:51,510 --> 01:10:56,250
Jesus! I'll talk to you later, OK? Bye.

1108
01:10:56,290 --> 01:10:58,410
That was my mother.

1109
01:11:21,380 --> 01:11:24,140
Do you still want to do something tonight?

1110
01:11:24,180 --> 01:11:25,650
What happened to Seymour?

1111
01:11:25,680 --> 01:11:28,780
I can't believe this. He actually scored.

1112
01:11:28,820 --> 01:11:31,150
God, how repulsive.

1113
01:11:31,190 --> 01:11:33,160
So, should I come over?

1114
01:11:33,190 --> 01:11:37,290
Actually, I was just about to go out with some friends.

1115
01:11:37,330 --> 01:11:40,660
What are you talking about? Who?

1116
01:11:40,700 --> 01:11:42,820
Just some people from work.

1117
01:11:45,330 --> 01:11:46,800
I don't believe you.

1118
01:11:46,840 --> 01:11:50,000
You said you were busy, so...

1119
01:11:50,040 --> 01:11:53,240
Look, I better get going.

1120
01:11:53,280 --> 01:11:56,040
I guess I'll call you tomorrow.

1121
01:12:38,150 --> 01:12:39,920
Boo!

1122
01:12:39,960 --> 01:12:41,120
Please.

1123
01:12:43,160 --> 01:12:44,520
Boy.

1124
01:12:45,960 --> 01:12:48,260
So, where have you been?

1125
01:12:48,300 --> 01:12:49,960
I've been looking all over for you.

1126
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,260
I've been wandering the streets day and night...

1127
01:12:52,300 --> 01:12:53,890
trying to find you.

1128
01:12:53,940 --> 01:12:55,060
Really?

1129
01:12:55,100 --> 01:12:57,900
No. Joe told me where you are.

1130
01:13:00,110 --> 01:13:03,200
But how come you never call me anymore?

1131
01:13:03,250 --> 01:13:08,080
I'm sorry. I've just been really busy.

1132
01:13:10,020 --> 01:13:14,120
So, how are things going with...

1133
01:13:14,160 --> 01:13:16,620
What's her name? Dana?

1134
01:13:16,660 --> 01:13:20,290
Pretty well. Surprisingly, you know.

1135
01:13:20,330 --> 01:13:23,420
It's good.

1136
01:13:25,070 --> 01:13:28,900
What do you do together? Is she into your old records and stuff?

1137
01:13:28,940 --> 01:13:33,710
Yeah, sort of. I mean, she doesn't dislike that stuff.

1138
01:13:33,740 --> 01:13:35,000
Anyway, she's trying.

1139
01:13:35,040 --> 01:13:37,240
Actually, we're supposed to go antique shopping...

1140
01:13:37,280 --> 01:13:40,150
for her apartment this afternoon.

1141
01:13:40,180 --> 01:13:42,510
Sounds good.

1142
01:13:42,550 --> 01:13:45,250
So, we should get together.

1143
01:13:45,290 --> 01:13:50,750
I'll definitely give you a call this week or something.

1144
01:13:50,790 --> 01:13:52,820
Are you trying to get rid of me?

1145
01:13:52,860 --> 01:13:55,520
No, no, no. It's just that I...

1146
01:13:55,560 --> 01:13:57,860
I should be going in a few minutes, and...

1147
01:14:00,750 --> 01:14:04,080
Aren't you even going to ask how I'm doing?

1148
01:14:05,660 --> 01:14:06,780
Sorry.

1149
01:14:06,820 --> 01:14:09,660
So, how are you?

1150
01:14:11,600 --> 01:14:14,290
I don't know. Good, I guess.

1151
01:14:16,970 --> 01:14:20,270
Oh, hello. Guess I'm a little early.

1152
01:14:24,410 --> 01:14:28,610
- This is Enid.
- Hello.

1153
01:14:28,650 --> 01:14:31,710
It's great to finally meet you.

1154
01:14:31,750 --> 01:14:35,650
So, how do you two know each other?

1155
01:14:35,690 --> 01:14:37,920
I'm kind of surprised he hasn't mentioned me.

1156
01:14:37,950 --> 01:14:40,680
- We're old friends.
- Really?

1157
01:14:40,720 --> 01:14:42,690
Yeah. Very close.

1158
01:14:42,730 --> 01:14:45,630
In fact, I was standing right next to him...

1159
01:14:45,660 --> 01:14:47,100
the first day you called.

1160
01:14:47,130 --> 01:14:48,960
You know, if it wasn't for me...

1161
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:51,330
he would have never called you back.

1162
01:14:51,370 --> 01:14:53,960
- Is that right?
- I would have--

1163
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:55,840
Well, I've really got to get going...

1164
01:14:55,870 --> 01:14:59,500
but I'll stop by and see you sometime, Seymour.

1165
01:15:01,680 --> 01:15:04,370
It really was great to meet you.

1166
01:15:07,520 --> 01:15:09,780
Now remember, the art show is this Saturday...

1167
01:15:09,820 --> 01:15:11,340
7:30 p.m., sharp.

1168
01:15:15,190 --> 01:15:17,250
Oh, and Justin.

1169
01:15:19,300 --> 01:15:21,090
I'm sorry.

1170
01:15:23,300 --> 01:15:25,460
I'm gonna really miss all of you people.

1171
01:15:25,500 --> 01:15:28,340
I hope that each of you feels as if you'll be...

1172
01:15:28,370 --> 01:15:31,640
taking away something from this experience.

1173
01:15:34,280 --> 01:15:36,510
Thanks. So long, everyone.

1174
01:15:41,280 --> 01:15:43,840
Enid, can I speak to you for a moment?

1175
01:15:43,890 --> 01:15:46,380
- Uh-oh.
- Don't worry, it's nothing bad.

1176
01:15:46,420 --> 01:15:48,410
I got a call from a close friend of mine...

1177
01:15:48,460 --> 01:15:50,390
at the Academy of Art and Design...

1178
01:15:50,430 --> 01:15:53,560
and she tells me I'm allowed to place one student...

1179
01:15:53,600 --> 01:15:57,000
from your graduating class for a full one-year scholarship...

1180
01:15:57,030 --> 01:16:00,230
and I took the liberty of submitting your name.

1181
01:16:00,270 --> 01:16:01,930
As far as I know it includes housing...

1182
01:16:01,970 --> 01:16:04,940
and meals and everything. It's really quite an offer.

1183
01:16:06,280 --> 01:16:09,770
Let me know as soon as you can, Enid.

1184
01:16:09,810 --> 01:16:12,340
This could be a really great thing for you.

1185
01:16:19,490 --> 01:16:22,580
Pumpkin? Honey?

1186
01:16:22,630 --> 01:16:24,150
I'm coming in.

1187
01:16:25,430 --> 01:16:27,690
Well, I have some good news.

1188
01:16:27,730 --> 01:16:28,960
What is it now?

1189
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:30,590
Are you still looking for a job?

1190
01:16:30,630 --> 01:16:32,100
I guess.

1191
01:16:32,140 --> 01:16:35,100
Maxine thinks she can get you a job at Computer Station.

1192
01:16:35,140 --> 01:16:38,730
Normally, you have to have a lot of references....

1193
01:16:38,780 --> 01:16:40,830
and at least two years of experience...

1194
01:16:40,880 --> 01:16:43,640
but she thinks she can convince them.

1195
01:16:44,810 --> 01:16:47,110
Tell her to forget it. I don't need her help.

1196
01:16:49,820 --> 01:16:52,650
OK, that's...

1197
01:16:52,690 --> 01:16:55,780
You know, if that's...

1198
01:16:55,830 --> 01:16:56,990
If--Mm-hmm.

1199
01:17:14,440 --> 01:17:16,240
Awful! Just awful!

1200
01:17:16,280 --> 01:17:18,180
I will take care of it, I promise you.

1201
01:17:18,220 --> 01:17:21,180
I will handle it. Thank you.

1202
01:17:21,220 --> 01:17:24,050
Excuse me.

1203
01:17:24,090 --> 01:17:26,610
I'm sorry, I need to speak with her for a second.

1204
01:17:26,660 --> 01:17:28,590
- Well, enjoy the show.
- Thank you.

1205
01:17:28,630 --> 01:17:29,750
Yes, what is it, Phyllis?

1206
01:17:29,790 --> 01:17:30,920
I am sorry...

1207
01:17:30,960 --> 01:17:33,190
but you are simply going to have to remove that painting.

1208
01:17:33,230 --> 01:17:35,130
Several of the parents have complained about it already.

1209
01:17:35,170 --> 01:17:37,660
Well, I will do no such thing.

1210
01:17:37,700 --> 01:17:40,190
Then I'm going to go over there and take it down myself.

1211
01:17:40,240 --> 01:17:42,870
I think we should give the artist a chance...

1212
01:17:42,910 --> 01:17:46,210
to talk with the parents about her intentions with this piece.

1213
01:17:46,240 --> 01:17:49,210
We should be promoting discussion as a solution...

1214
01:17:49,250 --> 01:17:50,540
instead of censorship.

1215
01:17:50,580 --> 01:17:52,170
- Censorship?
- Yes.

1216
01:17:52,220 --> 01:17:54,810
Oh, that is such a big word for you, Roberta.

1217
01:17:54,850 --> 01:17:56,840
Excuse me.

1218
01:17:56,890 --> 01:17:59,620
- Do not touch that--
- OK, I have a solution.

1219
01:17:59,660 --> 01:18:00,920
Thank you, everyone, for your patience.

1220
01:18:03,330 --> 01:18:06,190
Margaret, have you seen Enid?

1221
01:18:06,230 --> 01:18:09,130
- I don't think she's even here.
- You're kidding.

1222
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:14,330
- All right. There we go.
- Thank you very much.

1223
01:18:25,750 --> 01:18:28,380
So--Excuse me.

1224
01:18:28,420 --> 01:18:30,550
So there's this stupid art show I'm going to tonight...

1225
01:18:30,590 --> 01:18:32,050
and I want you to be my date.

1226
01:18:32,090 --> 01:18:33,280
There's something I want to show you.

1227
01:18:33,320 --> 01:18:36,380
Yeah, I... I don't think I should.

1228
01:18:36,430 --> 01:18:37,550
Of course you should.

1229
01:18:37,590 --> 01:18:39,820
I'm already a million hours late. Come on.

1230
01:18:39,860 --> 01:18:41,390
I better not.

1231
01:18:43,200 --> 01:18:46,790
OK, well, forget the art show. Let's do something else, then.

1232
01:18:46,840 --> 01:18:50,240
I really wish I could, Enid, but...

1233
01:18:50,270 --> 01:18:54,270
Dana just got out of a really bad relationship...

1234
01:18:54,310 --> 01:18:56,940
and I don't want her to have the wrong idea, you know?

1235
01:18:56,980 --> 01:18:58,570
Hey, what's happening?

1236
01:19:02,420 --> 01:19:04,410
Where'd you get those pants?

1237
01:19:06,860 --> 01:19:08,380
They were a present from Dana.

1238
01:19:08,430 --> 01:19:10,720
You like them? They a good fit?

1239
01:19:13,160 --> 01:19:15,760
Yeah, whatever. I mean, what do I know about clothes?

1240
01:19:15,800 --> 01:19:18,200
It's nice to have somebody do all the work for me.

1241
01:19:23,740 --> 01:19:25,400
I'll just be in my room.

1242
01:19:27,680 --> 01:19:29,200
What's her deal, anyway?

1243
01:19:29,250 --> 01:19:31,770
Did she actually tell you that you can't see me anymore?

1244
01:19:31,820 --> 01:19:34,480
No. No, I mean...

1245
01:19:36,550 --> 01:19:38,750
Not exactly. She just...

1246
01:19:41,760 --> 01:19:45,090
She just doesn't understand how I would know someone like you.

1247
01:19:45,130 --> 01:19:47,390
What does that mean, "someone like me"?

1248
01:19:47,430 --> 01:19:50,560
Just someone so young.

1249
01:19:56,240 --> 01:19:58,260
Don't worry. I won't bother you anymore.

1250
01:20:53,100 --> 01:20:54,720
Do you remember me?

1251
01:20:56,870 --> 01:20:59,060
Sure. Sure.

1252
01:21:04,640 --> 01:21:09,310
You're, like, the only person in this world I can count on...

1253
01:21:09,350 --> 01:21:13,680
because, no matter what, I know you'll always be here.

1254
01:21:16,220 --> 01:21:19,660
Well, that's what you think.

1255
01:21:21,390 --> 01:21:23,860
I'm leaving town.

1256
01:21:28,840 --> 01:21:31,210
Where are we? This is such a weird neighborhood.

1257
01:21:31,240 --> 01:21:33,800
This is a totally normal, average neighborhood.

1258
01:21:33,850 --> 01:21:36,810
3128.

1259
01:21:36,850 --> 01:21:38,870
- That must be it.
- Great.

1260
01:21:40,650 --> 01:21:44,020
What? What's wrong with it? It looks totally normal.

1261
01:21:44,060 --> 01:21:45,650
What? I said great.

1262
01:21:45,690 --> 01:21:47,180
Yeah, I can tell you really love it.

1263
01:21:47,230 --> 01:21:49,280
What am I supposed to say?

1264
01:21:49,330 --> 01:21:51,160
"Gee, I can't wait to live in some depressing shit-hole...

1265
01:21:51,200 --> 01:21:52,320
"out in the middle of nowhere"?

1266
01:21:52,360 --> 01:21:54,990
You know, you hate every single place that we look at.

1267
01:21:55,030 --> 01:21:59,230
Why don't you just tell me you don't want to live with me?

1268
01:22:01,410 --> 01:22:05,270
Because you'll totally freak out and act like a psycho about it.

1269
01:22:05,310 --> 01:22:07,280
What?

1270
01:22:07,310 --> 01:22:08,540
You're the psycho.

1271
01:22:08,580 --> 01:22:11,670
You've totally ignored me ever since high school ended.

1272
01:22:11,720 --> 01:22:15,480
You're still living out some stupid seventh-grade fantasy!

1273
01:22:15,520 --> 01:22:16,820
"Your own apartment."

1274
01:22:16,860 --> 01:22:18,550
Fuck you.

1275
01:22:18,590 --> 01:22:21,650
Have fun living with your dad for the rest of your life.

1276
01:22:27,530 --> 01:22:30,930
God. Fuck you, too.

1277
01:22:33,170 --> 01:22:35,200
Pumpkin?

1278
01:22:35,240 --> 01:22:37,610
Pumpkin?

1279
01:22:40,480 --> 01:22:42,110
Honey?

1280
01:22:42,150 --> 01:22:43,770
What's wrong?

1281
01:22:47,890 --> 01:22:49,010
Nothing.

1282
01:22:49,050 --> 01:22:50,520
Because, honey, if something's wrong...

1283
01:22:50,560 --> 01:22:53,080
I'd love it if we could talk about it.

1284
01:22:54,760 --> 01:22:57,320
It's nothing. It's just some hormonal thing.

1285
01:22:57,360 --> 01:22:58,950
Don't worry about it.

1286
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:02,730
OK, because I have some very, very important news...

1287
01:23:02,770 --> 01:23:04,790
to talk about...

1288
01:23:04,840 --> 01:23:09,240
and if you're not feeling well, we can do this some other time.

1289
01:23:11,440 --> 01:23:12,970
What?

1290
01:23:14,650 --> 01:23:18,510
Well, Maxine and I have been seeing a lot of each other.

1291
01:23:18,550 --> 01:23:20,480
And we were thinking it might be really best...

1292
01:23:20,520 --> 01:23:23,890
for all of us if at the end of the summer...

1293
01:23:23,920 --> 01:23:25,690
she came here to live with us.

1294
01:23:25,720 --> 01:23:28,420
We could really just see how we got along together...

1295
01:23:28,460 --> 01:23:31,160
and see if this is--

1296
01:23:44,540 --> 01:23:48,030
Is this your first death mask?

1297
01:23:48,080 --> 01:23:50,450
All artists have to suffer.

1298
01:23:51,650 --> 01:23:53,950
Just a minute.

1299
01:23:53,990 --> 01:23:58,720
I brought the application for the art academy.

1300
01:23:58,760 --> 01:24:00,950
I just hope it's not too late.

1301
01:24:02,330 --> 01:24:05,260
I am so sorry about what happened, Enid.

1302
01:24:05,300 --> 01:24:07,490
What do you mean?

1303
01:24:07,530 --> 01:24:09,590
Well, the whole business with the art show...

1304
01:24:09,630 --> 01:24:13,540
and the newspaper-- it's just absolutely...

1305
01:24:13,570 --> 01:24:15,630
They're forcing me to give you...

1306
01:24:15,670 --> 01:24:18,580
a non-passing grade in the class.

1307
01:24:20,050 --> 01:24:22,950
Can't I still get a scholarship to the art academy?

1308
01:24:22,980 --> 01:24:25,510
- Well, I'm sorry, Enid--
- Can you help me out here?

1309
01:24:25,550 --> 01:24:28,610
- I can't breath under this mask.
- Excuse me.

1310
01:24:28,650 --> 01:24:32,050
That's fine. Just breathe. Don't worry about it.

1311
01:24:50,510 --> 01:24:53,140
Hey, what are you doing here?

1312
01:24:53,180 --> 01:24:55,240
I needed to see you.

1313
01:24:55,280 --> 01:24:57,540
What's up?

1314
01:24:57,580 --> 01:25:00,020
Can you at least let me in?

1315
01:25:00,050 --> 01:25:01,640
Yeah, sure. Come on in.

1316
01:25:03,660 --> 01:25:05,920
Look, I just need someone to be nice to me for five minutes...

1317
01:25:05,960 --> 01:25:08,260
and then I swear I'll leave you alone, OK?

1318
01:25:09,530 --> 01:25:10,690
What's the matter?

1319
01:25:12,660 --> 01:25:14,260
Do you have anything to drink?

1320
01:25:14,300 --> 01:25:16,960
There might be some root beer.

1321
01:25:18,570 --> 01:25:20,730
- What's this?
- That's Dana's.

1322
01:25:20,770 --> 01:25:23,140
We're supposed to be saving it for our two-month anniversary.

1323
01:25:23,170 --> 01:25:24,330
You better not--

1324
01:25:32,320 --> 01:25:36,520
I mean, you like me, right, Seymour?

1325
01:25:36,550 --> 01:25:38,020
We're good friends, right?

1326
01:25:38,060 --> 01:25:40,650
Yeah, sure. Of course.

1327
01:25:53,270 --> 01:25:55,100
What is this?

1328
01:25:55,140 --> 01:26:00,240
Dana got it when we went shopping for antiques.

1329
01:26:00,280 --> 01:26:01,800
She said it didn't go with her stuff...

1330
01:26:01,850 --> 01:26:04,280
so she gave it to me.

1331
01:26:04,320 --> 01:26:08,340
Said it would go better with my old-time thingamajigs.

1332
01:26:11,190 --> 01:26:14,160
Jesus, how can you stand her?

1333
01:26:17,200 --> 01:26:19,190
How come all that time I was trying to get you a date...

1334
01:26:19,230 --> 01:26:20,750
you never asked me out?

1335
01:26:23,100 --> 01:26:24,590
You're a beautiful young girl.

1336
01:26:24,640 --> 01:26:26,800
I couldn't imagine you'd have any interest in me...

1337
01:26:26,840 --> 01:26:30,830
except as an amusingly cranky eccentric curiosity.

1338
01:26:30,880 --> 01:26:33,840
At least you're not like every other stupid guy in the world.

1339
01:26:33,880 --> 01:26:36,900
All they care about is guitars or sports.

1340
01:26:36,950 --> 01:26:39,280
I hate sports.

1341
01:26:45,160 --> 01:26:47,490
Maybe I should just move in with you.

1342
01:26:47,530 --> 01:26:51,020
I could do the cooking and dust your old records...

1343
01:26:51,060 --> 01:26:52,960
until I get a job.

1344
01:26:58,900 --> 01:27:01,100
You know what my number one fantasy used to be?

1345
01:27:03,140 --> 01:27:04,300
What?

1346
01:27:04,340 --> 01:27:07,370
I used to think about one day...

1347
01:27:07,410 --> 01:27:11,610
just not telling anyone and going off to some random place.

1348
01:27:12,750 --> 01:27:18,690
And I'd just disappear...

1349
01:27:18,720 --> 01:27:21,060
and they'd never see me again.

1350
01:27:21,090 --> 01:27:23,560
Do you ever think about stuff like that?

1351
01:27:24,900 --> 01:27:27,330
I guess I probably did when I was your age.

1352
01:27:29,430 --> 01:27:32,060
You know what we should do?

1353
01:27:32,100 --> 01:27:35,500
We should just get in your car right now and just drive off.

1354
01:27:35,540 --> 01:27:37,870
Just find some totally new place...

1355
01:27:37,910 --> 01:27:39,470
and start a whole new life.

1356
01:27:39,510 --> 01:27:41,570
Fuck everybody.

1357
01:27:42,880 --> 01:27:46,980
I'm not in any good condition to drive.

1358
01:27:47,020 --> 01:27:49,920
I'm serious.

1359
01:27:49,950 --> 01:27:52,080
I'm just so sick of everybody.

1360
01:27:52,120 --> 01:27:54,890
Why can't I just do what I want?

1361
01:27:54,930 --> 01:27:57,330
What do you want?

1362
01:27:59,500 --> 01:28:01,190
What do you want?

1363
01:28:05,270 --> 01:28:06,930
Don't you like me?

1364
01:28:25,420 --> 01:28:28,650
Boy, I never expected anything like this to happen.

1365
01:28:31,650 --> 01:28:34,280
Yeah, well, me, neither.

1366
01:28:34,320 --> 01:28:37,190
You must know I always...

1367
01:28:39,300 --> 01:28:42,920
Did you mean all that stuff about moving in with me?

1368
01:28:46,600 --> 01:28:49,400
I was just thinking out loud.

1369
01:28:51,110 --> 01:28:56,040
I mean, you've got this thing with Dana, and...

1370
01:28:56,080 --> 01:28:57,770
I'm not gonna let you fuck that up.

1371
01:28:57,810 --> 01:29:01,440
Yeah, but I don't know, I just...

1372
01:29:05,020 --> 01:29:07,150
I really need to get some sleep.

1373
01:29:10,930 --> 01:29:12,520
Good night.

1374
01:29:44,960 --> 01:29:47,520
Right. One second.

1375
01:29:49,070 --> 01:29:52,520
- Sorry. Go ahead.
- We're almost done.

1376
01:29:52,570 --> 01:29:55,230
Hi. Yeah. No, it's excluded.

1377
01:29:55,270 --> 01:29:58,140
They've already paid the earnest money.

1378
01:29:58,170 --> 01:29:59,370
Well, let's see if they bring it up...

1379
01:29:59,410 --> 01:30:02,570
if they notice it on the final walkthrough.

1380
01:30:02,610 --> 01:30:03,770
Right.

1381
01:30:04,980 --> 01:30:07,010
Great. Sounds good.

1382
01:30:09,150 --> 01:30:10,920
- Yes!
- We did it!

1383
01:30:10,950 --> 01:30:12,620
- Great job.
- Thank you.

1384
01:30:12,660 --> 01:30:15,950
I'm proud of you. I'll catch you guys later.

1385
01:30:15,990 --> 01:30:17,960
I'm going to start the paperwork.

1386
01:30:22,230 --> 01:30:24,500
- Congratulations.
- Thank you. Have a seat.

1387
01:30:27,840 --> 01:30:31,800
So, what brings you down here?

1388
01:30:34,240 --> 01:30:40,650
I just really feel like I need to say something to you.

1389
01:30:43,050 --> 01:30:45,250
I've never said this to anyone before.

1390
01:30:45,290 --> 01:30:47,720
Believe me, I've...

1391
01:30:47,760 --> 01:30:50,780
I've stayed in horrible relationships for years...

1392
01:30:50,830 --> 01:30:53,160
just so I wouldn't have to do this.

1393
01:30:53,200 --> 01:30:56,170
What are you trying to say?

1394
01:30:58,840 --> 01:31:03,070
Maybe it's not such a good idea that we keep going out.

1395
01:31:13,280 --> 01:31:15,110
It's Enid. Leave a message.

1396
01:31:16,890 --> 01:31:18,250
Seymour, here.

1397
01:31:18,290 --> 01:31:21,780
I really want to talk to you.

1398
01:31:21,820 --> 01:31:23,920
I've been thinking about what you said...

1399
01:31:23,960 --> 01:31:26,660
about moving in here, and...

1400
01:31:26,700 --> 01:31:31,430
Yeah, so just...

1401
01:31:31,470 --> 01:31:33,200
give me a call when you get a chance.

1402
01:31:33,240 --> 01:31:34,570
OK. Thanks. Bye.

1403
01:31:44,750 --> 01:31:47,440
Look, I'm really sorry about the other day.

1404
01:31:47,480 --> 01:31:49,540
I don't know what's wrong with me.

1405
01:31:49,590 --> 01:31:51,210
I really do want to move in with you.

1406
01:31:51,250 --> 01:31:53,450
Look, I don't know.

1407
01:31:55,330 --> 01:31:58,620
I was thinking maybe I should just live alone, you know?

1408
01:31:58,660 --> 01:32:02,720
I've decided to rent that place that we looked at...

1409
01:32:02,770 --> 01:32:06,430
and I start moving in next week.

1410
01:32:06,470 --> 01:32:10,060
Please let me come with you. Please.

1411
01:32:10,110 --> 01:32:13,080
Look, I don't know. I don't think it's such a good idea.

1412
01:32:13,110 --> 01:32:15,630
Of course it's a good idea. It's our plan.

1413
01:32:15,680 --> 01:32:17,670
Yeah, but how are you going to pay rent and everything?

1414
01:32:17,710 --> 01:32:19,440
You don't even have a job.

1415
01:32:19,480 --> 01:32:22,650
I'll get a job tomorrow. I promise.

1416
01:32:22,690 --> 01:32:25,680
Maxine said she could get me a job at Computer Station.

1417
01:32:25,720 --> 01:32:29,450
Please, Becca.

1418
01:32:30,790 --> 01:32:33,320
Tonight, I have a very special partner--

1419
01:32:33,360 --> 01:32:36,760
one who is a performance artist...

1420
01:32:36,800 --> 01:32:38,960
in sign language for the deaf.

1421
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:41,440
Please welcome to the stage...

1422
01:32:45,240 --> 01:32:46,800
Well, here's where the fun never stops.

1423
01:32:46,840 --> 01:32:49,310
She could at least have the decency to call me back.

1424
01:32:49,350 --> 01:32:53,840
Wasted time, trying to logically figure out the female brain.

1425
01:32:53,880 --> 01:32:56,110
That's for sure.

1426
01:32:56,150 --> 01:32:57,810
Maybe she got another boyfriend.

1427
01:33:01,590 --> 01:33:03,150
Yeah, well, thanks for cheering me up.

1428
01:33:16,710 --> 01:33:18,200
Oh, God.

1429
01:33:29,020 --> 01:33:30,320
It's Enid. Leave a message.

1430
01:33:32,720 --> 01:33:36,090
Oh, come on.

1431
01:33:37,730 --> 01:33:39,350
Hey, look at it this way...

1432
01:33:40,600 --> 01:33:42,330
at least things can't get any worse.

1433
01:33:50,640 --> 01:33:53,940
Seymour! Just the man I want to see.

1434
01:33:53,980 --> 01:33:56,170
Step in here for a minute.

1435
01:33:59,020 --> 01:34:00,640
Have a seat.

1436
01:34:02,390 --> 01:34:05,680
What can you tell me about this, Seymour?

1437
01:34:15,670 --> 01:34:17,100
So, what do you think?

1438
01:34:18,770 --> 01:34:20,600
It's fine.

1439
01:34:23,270 --> 01:34:25,740
- Where's all your stuff?
- There.

1440
01:34:30,350 --> 01:34:32,510
That's all you're bringing?

1441
01:34:32,550 --> 01:34:34,070
No. I'm gonna pack up the rest tonight.

1442
01:34:34,120 --> 01:34:36,310
I'll bring it over sometime tomorrow.

1443
01:34:36,350 --> 01:34:38,680
What time?

1444
01:34:38,720 --> 01:34:41,420
I don't know. Noon?

1445
01:34:41,460 --> 01:34:44,090
All right, cool. Just make sure you're here by then...

1446
01:34:44,130 --> 01:34:46,650
because we got a lot of stuff to do.

1447
01:34:46,700 --> 01:34:48,560
Oh, wait.

1448
01:34:48,600 --> 01:34:51,120
I got to show you this. It's really cool.

1449
01:34:56,410 --> 01:34:58,470
Isn't it great?

1450
01:35:31,810 --> 01:35:34,370
A smile is something special

1451
01:35:34,410 --> 01:35:37,440
A ribbon is something rare

1452
01:35:37,480 --> 01:35:40,070
So I'll be special, and I'll be rare

1453
01:35:40,120 --> 01:35:44,580
With a smile and a ribbon in my hair

1454
01:35:45,940 --> 01:35:48,430
To be a girl they notice

1455
01:35:48,480 --> 01:35:51,070
Takes more than a fancy dress

1456
01:35:51,120 --> 01:35:54,280
So I'll be special, and I'll be rare

1457
01:35:54,320 --> 01:35:57,450
I'll be something beyond compare

1458
01:35:57,490 --> 01:35:59,890
I'll be noticed because I'll wear

1459
01:35:59,920 --> 01:36:05,660
A smile and a ribbon in my hair

1460
01:36:35,630 --> 01:36:38,250
What's wrong with you, retard? It's 3:30.

1461
01:36:38,300 --> 01:36:42,860
Oh, hi. Enid's stepmother told me that she'd be here.

1462
01:36:42,900 --> 01:36:44,460
She's not at home?

1463
01:36:44,500 --> 01:36:46,700
No, they told me that she'd be here.

1464
01:36:46,740 --> 01:36:48,860
Well, where the fuck is she?

1465
01:36:48,910 --> 01:36:51,030
She was supposed to be here three hours ago.

1466
01:36:51,070 --> 01:36:54,840
Do you mind if I wait? I really need to talk to her.

1467
01:37:00,880 --> 01:37:02,110
Are you sure she wasn't there?

1468
01:37:02,150 --> 01:37:04,620
I mean, maybe she was just hiding from you or something.

1469
01:37:04,660 --> 01:37:07,090
Why would she be hiding from me?

1470
01:37:07,120 --> 01:37:09,020
I don't know.

1471
01:37:09,060 --> 01:37:11,080
Where is she, then?

1472
01:37:12,860 --> 01:37:14,090
Maybe she's with Josh?

1473
01:37:14,130 --> 01:37:17,620
Josh? Why would she be with Josh?

1474
01:37:17,670 --> 01:37:21,540
I really don't know enough about it to...

1475
01:37:22,740 --> 01:37:25,170
But why did you say that she was hiding from me?

1476
01:37:25,210 --> 01:37:26,870
Did she say anything to you about me?

1477
01:37:28,650 --> 01:37:30,310
Yeah. She thinks you're a dork.

1478
01:37:30,350 --> 01:37:32,510
She said that?

1479
01:37:33,850 --> 01:37:38,250
What do you expect? I mean, considering how we met you...

1480
01:37:38,290 --> 01:37:40,280
What do you mean?

1481
01:37:40,320 --> 01:37:42,350
She didn't tell you about that?

1482
01:37:44,700 --> 01:37:46,060
What are you talking about?

1483
01:37:47,330 --> 01:37:49,600
On that pathetic fake blind date?

1484
01:37:49,630 --> 01:37:52,660
What fake blind date? What are you talking about?

1485
01:37:57,540 --> 01:37:58,700
Here.

1486
01:38:03,750 --> 01:38:05,040
Look.

1487
01:38:35,410 --> 01:38:36,780
Did you have a good laugh at my expense?

1488
01:38:38,050 --> 01:38:39,380
What do you mean?

1489
01:38:39,420 --> 01:38:42,040
Do you think that's funny?

1490
01:38:43,320 --> 01:38:45,520
Here, is that funny?

1491
01:38:45,560 --> 01:38:47,650
I'll show you something funny.

1492
01:38:51,730 --> 01:38:54,320
- Hey. Damn it. Come on.
- Get--

1493
01:39:00,200 --> 01:39:03,660
Not so cool now, are you, good-looking boy?

1494
01:39:03,710 --> 01:39:05,680
- What's going on?
- Call the cops, man.

1495
01:39:05,710 --> 01:39:06,840
- Citizen's arrest.
- You!

1496
01:39:06,880 --> 01:39:08,340
Call the cops!

1497
01:39:08,380 --> 01:39:09,500
Get the hell out of my store!

1498
01:39:09,550 --> 01:39:12,070
All right. Hey, no need to get violent.

1499
01:39:12,120 --> 01:39:13,280
I'm outta here.

1500
01:39:39,710 --> 01:39:42,180
Are you OK?

1501
01:39:49,250 --> 01:39:52,050
You seem a little stoned. What are you on?

1502
01:39:53,320 --> 01:39:55,120
High on life.

1503
01:39:55,160 --> 01:39:58,090
Look, Seymour, I came by to tell you...

1504
01:39:58,130 --> 01:40:01,690
how really, really sorry I am about everything.

1505
01:40:01,730 --> 01:40:03,290
I know you probably totally hate me.

1506
01:40:03,330 --> 01:40:04,600
You don't have to say--

1507
01:40:04,630 --> 01:40:07,500
Please. Don't say anything.

1508
01:40:07,540 --> 01:40:10,300
I know I'm a total disappointment to everyone.

1509
01:40:12,780 --> 01:40:15,180
I just quit my job this morning...

1510
01:40:15,210 --> 01:40:17,270
and then I had a fight with Becky...

1511
01:40:17,310 --> 01:40:19,150
because I told her I wasn't going to move in with her...

1512
01:40:19,180 --> 01:40:23,310
and she really just wants to kill me.

1513
01:40:23,350 --> 01:40:28,310
And there is just no way to explain how I feel.

1514
01:40:28,360 --> 01:40:29,520
I don't...

1515
01:40:32,030 --> 01:40:35,470
I guess I'll just have to figure myself out.

1516
01:40:35,500 --> 01:40:37,630
Enid, I'm not mad at you.

1517
01:40:37,670 --> 01:40:39,260
I know I'm just a dork.

1518
01:40:39,300 --> 01:40:41,770
Seymour, you are not a dork.

1519
01:40:43,540 --> 01:40:45,030
Sure I am.

1520
01:40:59,160 --> 01:41:01,120
You are such a stupid idiot.

1521
01:41:01,160 --> 01:41:03,520
Did you even look through the rest of the book?

1522
01:41:07,300 --> 01:41:09,320
See?

1523
01:41:19,710 --> 01:41:22,840
You're like...my hero.

1524
01:41:36,090 --> 01:41:37,890
Thanks for waiting.

1525
01:41:43,070 --> 01:41:45,130
Is he going to be OK?

1526
01:41:45,170 --> 01:41:47,400
I think he'll be fine.

1527
01:41:57,080 --> 01:41:59,070
What are you going to do now?

1528
01:42:02,020 --> 01:42:03,420
I'm not sure.

1529
01:42:04,550 --> 01:42:08,510
I'd better get going. I'm going to be late for work.

1530
01:42:11,900 --> 01:42:13,760
Call me, OK?

1531
01:44:25,600 --> 01:44:28,790
I have to admit things are starting to look up for me...

1532
01:44:28,830 --> 01:44:31,360
since my life turned to shit.

1533
01:44:31,400 --> 01:44:33,960
Remember what I said when we first started?

1534
01:44:34,010 --> 01:44:35,630
This little break-up might be...

1535
01:44:35,670 --> 01:44:37,840
the very best thing that ever happened to you.

1536
01:44:37,880 --> 01:44:42,610
I think I'm ready to get back to my old life.

1537
01:44:42,650 --> 01:44:44,880
You think that's too soon?

1538
01:44:46,650 --> 01:44:49,250
Why don't we start with that next week?

1539
01:44:51,020 --> 01:44:52,150
Thank you.

1540
01:44:52,190 --> 01:44:53,660
Don't thank me.

1541
01:44:53,690 --> 01:44:55,790
You're doing all the work.

1542
01:45:17,450 --> 01:45:19,850
- Is he done?
- Yes.

1543
01:45:19,890 --> 01:45:21,220
Seymour, did you have a chance...

1544
01:45:21,250 --> 01:45:22,720
to think about what you might want for dinner...

1545
01:45:22,750 --> 01:45:23,880
while you were in here?

1546
01:45:23,920 --> 01:45:26,050
No, I haven't.

1547
01:45:26,090 --> 01:45:28,860
Maybe we could discuss it in the car.

1548
01:45:28,890 --> 01:45:30,120
Did you want mashed potatoes?

1549
01:45:30,160 --> 01:45:31,990
See you next week.

1550
01:50:59,990 --> 01:51:02,680
Not so funny now, tough guy, are you, huh?

1551
01:51:14,540 --> 01:51:16,370
Motherfuckers!

1552
01:51:16,400 --> 01:51:18,060
Fuck with me?
