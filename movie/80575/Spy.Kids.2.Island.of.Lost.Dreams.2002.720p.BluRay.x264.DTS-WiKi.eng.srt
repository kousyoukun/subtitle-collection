1
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:24,728
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:24,801 --> 00:00:26,701
We want to welcome a very special guest

3
00:00:26,769 --> 00:00:27,861
to our park today --

4
00:00:27,937 --> 00:00:29,802
the president's daughter.

5
00:00:29,873 --> 00:00:31,841
Big smile. Big smile.

6
00:00:31,908 --> 00:00:33,375
Hello Alexandra.

7
00:00:33,443 --> 00:00:34,501
Where's your father?

8
00:00:34,577 --> 00:00:36,374
He'll be here.

9
00:00:36,446 --> 00:00:38,937
I'll make sure of it.

10
00:00:39,015 --> 00:00:41,279
Well hey there, little miss first lady,

11
00:00:41,351 --> 00:00:44,115
I'm Dinky Winks owner of this fine establishment.

12
00:00:44,187 --> 00:00:46,985
You ready to ride the ride and shrill to the thrills, spills and chills?

13
00:00:47,056 --> 00:00:48,318
Yes I am.

14
00:00:48,391 --> 00:00:50,052
Right this way!

15
00:00:51,728 --> 00:00:55,323
Of course that behind me -- the world-famous Whippersnapper.

16
00:00:55,398 --> 00:00:58,367
Guaranteed to make grown men howl

17
00:00:58,434 --> 00:01:00,334
like a cub woke at weaning time.

18
00:01:00,403 --> 00:01:01,734
Over on our left...

19
00:01:03,106 --> 00:01:05,973
The NerveWracker -- oh-ho painful.

20
00:01:07,243 --> 00:01:08,471
Good fun.

21
00:01:08,545 --> 00:01:10,240
On your other left

22
00:01:10,313 --> 00:01:13,510
is uh well, my personal favorite --

23
00:01:13,583 --> 00:01:14,811
the Vomiter.

24
00:01:14,884 --> 00:01:16,078
Now we tell people

25
00:01:16,152 --> 00:01:18,245
not to ride it on a full stomach,

26
00:01:18,321 --> 00:01:19,811
but you know folks.

27
00:01:19,889 --> 00:01:21,481
They just don't listen.

28
00:01:23,726 --> 00:01:25,125
But...

29
00:01:25,195 --> 00:01:27,322
why bother with any of those?

30
00:01:27,397 --> 00:01:30,127
You're here for my latest and greatest.

31
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,930
For your personal amusement and complete gratification,

32
00:01:33,002 --> 00:01:35,664
I humbly offer...

33
00:01:35,738 --> 00:01:37,672
the Juggler.

34
00:01:42,612 --> 00:01:44,307
But is it fast?

35
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:46,143
Is it fast?

36
00:01:46,216 --> 00:01:48,047
Well let's see shall we?

37
00:01:48,117 --> 00:01:50,551
The riders are strapped into the bubble.

38
00:01:53,523 --> 00:01:56,219
The hydrobot lifts the bubble high into the air.

39
00:01:59,529 --> 00:02:00,826
And spins it round and round as fast

40
00:02:00,897 --> 00:02:02,558
as the United States government will allow.

41
00:02:08,037 --> 00:02:09,561
The bubble spins turns, flips and bounces.

42
00:02:13,443 --> 00:02:15,741
And then...it juggles you.

43
00:02:18,514 --> 00:02:21,711
-- Whoa!

44
00:02:25,188 --> 00:02:26,382
I want to go on!

45
00:02:28,091 --> 00:02:29,752
I thought so.

46
00:02:29,826 --> 00:02:32,317
Now understand -- the override precautions are top-notch,

47
00:02:32,395 --> 00:02:34,295
modified by yours truly.

48
00:02:34,364 --> 00:02:36,059
I thought her father was supposed to be here.

49
00:02:36,132 --> 00:02:38,327
Man: The president has more pressing business

50
00:02:38,401 --> 00:02:39,732
than to spend an entire Sunday

51
00:02:39,802 --> 00:02:41,599
in a theme park.

52
00:02:41,671 --> 00:02:43,332
No one's that busy.

53
00:02:46,209 --> 00:02:47,642
Have fun kid.

54
00:02:49,045 --> 00:02:51,172
We'll take it a little slow,

55
00:02:51,247 --> 00:02:52,578
just make it fun.

56
00:03:04,527 --> 00:03:05,755
Can't you get her down?

57
00:03:05,828 --> 00:03:07,625
Somebody's jammed the override.

58
00:03:07,697 --> 00:03:10,689
Why that little troublemaker.

59
00:03:12,735 --> 00:03:14,635
Remain calm. Remain calm.

60
00:03:14,704 --> 00:03:17,764
We are the Secret Service. Everything is under control.

61
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,501
-- There's nothing we can do sir. -- What?

62
00:03:19,575 --> 00:03:21,440
The weight of our agents will prevent us from ascending

63
00:03:21,511 --> 00:03:23,376
the shaky precipice on which she now stands.

64
00:03:23,446 --> 00:03:25,107
She'll fall.

65
00:03:25,181 --> 00:03:27,206
Don't we have any smaller agents?

66
00:03:29,719 --> 00:03:32,984
Bring me agents SK1 and SK2.

67
00:03:33,056 --> 00:03:35,286
-- Coming through. -- Coming through.

68
00:03:42,632 --> 00:03:44,031
We're ready.

69
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:46,159
Use this -- the latest gear.

70
00:03:46,235 --> 00:03:47,793
We get to keep them afterwards?

71
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:49,201
N-No.

72
00:03:49,272 --> 00:03:50,296
Yes.

73
00:03:50,373 --> 00:03:51,840
Of course.

74
00:03:51,908 --> 00:03:53,398
Let's rock.

75
00:03:55,812 --> 00:03:58,303
You're sure they can handle this?

76
00:04:00,183 --> 00:04:02,208
If not, there are two others who can.

77
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:07,087
Bring me agents SK3 and SK4 as backup.

78
00:04:09,892 --> 00:04:11,757
We got company.

79
00:04:16,132 --> 00:04:19,033
Gary and Gerti -- what are they doing here?

80
00:04:35,685 --> 00:04:37,243
Excuse me there sport.

81
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:39,880
Where did you get that?

82
00:04:39,956 --> 00:04:41,890
Latest in electro-riser technology,

83
00:04:41,958 --> 00:04:44,426
with new composite materials and A.I. brainology.

84
00:04:44,494 --> 00:04:45,722
I can see

85
00:04:45,795 --> 00:04:47,729
you don't know what I'm talking about.

86
00:04:47,797 --> 00:04:49,765
Gary this is my rescue.

87
00:04:49,832 --> 00:04:51,390
We'll take it from here.

88
00:04:51,467 --> 00:04:54,994
"Latest gear," my butt.

89
00:04:56,172 --> 00:04:57,571
No no no!

90
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,130
You'll just make it worse!

91
00:05:01,711 --> 00:05:03,110
Now you done it.

92
00:05:03,179 --> 00:05:04,874
Over here!

93
00:05:04,947 --> 00:05:06,073
Get away from me!

94
00:05:06,149 --> 00:05:09,050
Alexandra take my hand!

95
00:05:09,118 --> 00:05:10,312
Back off!

96
00:05:10,386 --> 00:05:12,786
I want my father to come up here and get me.

97
00:05:12,855 --> 00:05:15,050
But he's the president of the United States.

98
00:05:15,124 --> 00:05:16,318
No he's my father.

99
00:05:16,392 --> 00:05:18,917
He was my father before he ever became president,

100
00:05:18,995 --> 00:05:21,088
and he should still be my father now.

101
00:05:21,164 --> 00:05:22,756
I want him up here!

102
00:05:22,832 --> 00:05:24,424
Sir we have a situation.

103
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:26,127
She's got the Transmooker.

104
00:05:26,202 --> 00:05:28,466
This is now a code-red situation.

105
00:05:28,538 --> 00:05:29,664
Get her down now!

106
00:05:29,739 --> 00:05:30,763
The point is,

107
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:33,308
you and your father need to have a talk.

108
00:05:33,376 --> 00:05:35,367
Up here may not be the best place.

109
00:05:35,445 --> 00:05:37,436
Come with me, and I promise you,

110
00:05:37,513 --> 00:05:39,913
the two of you will have that talk.

111
00:05:39,982 --> 00:05:42,576
How can you promise that?

112
00:05:42,652 --> 00:05:44,244
I'm Level 2.

113
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:47,084
I can order him to talk to you.

114
00:05:52,061 --> 00:05:53,392
Hi Gerti.

115
00:05:53,463 --> 00:05:55,124
Whatcha doing?

116
00:05:55,198 --> 00:05:56,529
I'm trying to stop the ride.

117
00:05:56,599 --> 00:05:59,124
-- Without disengaging the axis? -- Exactly.

118
00:05:59,202 --> 00:06:01,102
Then stop what you're doing.

119
00:06:01,170 --> 00:06:04,606
You see the ride is designed to work like a giant magnet.

120
00:06:04,674 --> 00:06:06,266
If you reverse the polarization,

121
00:06:06,342 --> 00:06:09,709
bye-bye, president's daughter.

122
00:06:15,451 --> 00:06:16,941
See you around.

123
00:06:19,856 --> 00:06:21,687
Okay.

124
00:06:21,757 --> 00:06:22,985
Wait.

125
00:06:23,059 --> 00:06:25,527
I took this from my father's office this morning.

126
00:06:25,595 --> 00:06:27,324
I'm sure he'll want it back.

127
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:29,529
Careful!

128
00:06:29,599 --> 00:06:32,090
Look Cortez you take her down, and I'll take this down.

129
00:06:32,168 --> 00:06:33,567
That way we both look good.

130
00:06:33,636 --> 00:06:36,332
I'm not doing this for looks Gary.

131
00:06:41,878 --> 00:06:44,711
Thank goodness you're all right Alexandra.

132
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:46,179
We were worried sick.

133
00:06:46,249 --> 00:06:48,410
Oh boys.

134
00:06:49,218 --> 00:06:51,743
I think this is what you're looking for.

135
00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:56,422
She swiped it from the president.

136
00:06:56,492 --> 00:06:58,960
Oh you're in big trouble this time missy.

137
00:07:00,129 --> 00:07:01,357
Wait a minute.

138
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:03,364
I promised her she could talk to her father.

139
00:07:03,432 --> 00:07:05,366
Oh she'll talk to him, all right.

140
00:07:05,434 --> 00:07:06,560
We'll make sure of that.

141
00:07:35,834 --> 00:07:38,560
- Promise me one thing. - What?

142
00:07:39,334 --> 00:07:41,560
No more ricky dicky thing on this

143
00:07:50,334 --> 00:07:53,560


144
00:07:53,734 --> 00:07:57,560


145
00:08:07,631 --> 00:08:10,691
So you want the Ukata assignment huh?

146
00:08:10,768 --> 00:08:13,532
Your duties are assigned to you by the agency --

147
00:08:13,604 --> 00:08:15,401
same as everyone, same as me.

148
00:08:15,472 --> 00:08:18,168
I know. It's just that we've learned so much.

149
00:08:18,242 --> 00:08:20,904
Juni and I are more than capable of taking bigger assignments.

150
00:08:20,978 --> 00:08:22,468
But that's not your decision to make.

151
00:08:22,546 --> 00:08:24,138
The Spy Kids organization is still new,

152
00:08:24,214 --> 00:08:25,875
and if you're a Level 3 or even a Level 2,

153
00:08:25,949 --> 00:08:28,611
you cannot go on a mission alone.

154
00:08:28,685 --> 00:08:30,585
You need more experience.

155
00:08:31,688 --> 00:08:32,882
Come on.

156
00:08:32,956 --> 00:08:35,220
Okay Mom if you're looking for top-secret information,

157
00:08:35,292 --> 00:08:36,691
just go straight to the source.

158
00:08:37,795 --> 00:08:39,285
Woman: Welcome to the Pentagon.

159
00:08:39,363 --> 00:08:42,161
How did you do that? You can't do that.

160
00:08:42,232 --> 00:08:43,631
There is no hacking in this household.

161
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:45,133
I know. Sorry.

162
00:08:45,202 --> 00:08:48,228
Show me that again.

163
00:08:51,475 --> 00:08:55,844
I know this hair thing is one of my weakest points.

164
00:08:55,913 --> 00:08:57,312
Wait one minute.

165
00:08:57,381 --> 00:09:00,145
You're gonna look cool.

166
00:09:00,217 --> 00:09:03,675
In fact you're looking cooler, right? Like me.

167
00:09:03,754 --> 00:09:05,517
Like Poppy.

168
00:09:05,589 --> 00:09:09,719
And it's kind of em-o-tion-al to me.

169
00:09:09,793 --> 00:09:11,420
You know? Uh-oh.

170
00:09:11,495 --> 00:09:12,928
A knot.

171
00:09:12,996 --> 00:09:14,520
We are gonna...

172
00:09:15,933 --> 00:09:16,900
You...

173
00:09:16,967 --> 00:09:19,162
Uh-huh uh-huh. We got it.

174
00:09:19,236 --> 00:09:20,931
That's my boy.

175
00:09:21,004 --> 00:09:22,437
Last touch.

176
00:09:24,575 --> 00:09:26,736
You want me to tie it for you?

177
00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:28,903
No it's okay. R.A.L.P.H. can do it.

178
00:09:32,216 --> 00:09:34,241
Bow tie R.A.L.P.H.,

179
00:09:34,318 --> 00:09:36,252
and not too tight.

180
00:09:48,265 --> 00:09:49,698
Thanks R.A.L.P.H.

181
00:09:53,604 --> 00:09:54,536
Interesting.

182
00:09:54,605 --> 00:09:55,572
But...

183
00:09:55,639 --> 00:09:59,973
he can never ever replace...

184
00:10:00,043 --> 00:10:01,635
me.

185
00:10:02,913 --> 00:10:03,971
Not yet but I think

186
00:10:04,047 --> 00:10:06,311
that new upgrade comes in next week.

187
00:10:08,952 --> 00:10:10,817
Oh.

188
00:10:10,888 --> 00:10:13,413
Only joking.

189
00:10:17,361 --> 00:10:19,056
Kids. Kids. Kids. Kids.

190
00:10:19,162 --> 00:10:21,221
Ki--

191
00:10:21,298 --> 00:10:23,596
Joking?

192
00:10:24,935 --> 00:10:26,095
Thank you.

193
00:10:26,169 --> 00:10:27,431
Yes ma'am.

194
00:10:27,504 --> 00:10:28,698
Okay. Remember kids,

195
00:10:28,772 --> 00:10:31,434
this is a very important night for your father.

196
00:10:31,508 --> 00:10:34,136
And if he's named director of the O.S.S.,

197
00:10:34,210 --> 00:10:36,610
be sure to stand up and give him a big hug,

198
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:37,977
all right?

199
00:10:38,048 --> 00:10:40,141
What if Dad doesn't win?

200
00:10:40,216 --> 00:10:43,379
Well then, give him a bigger hug.

201
00:10:47,657 --> 00:10:49,022
Oh Yao Ling Wa Ling,

202
00:10:49,092 --> 00:10:51,060
this is Danielle and Dione Daluc.

203
00:10:51,127 --> 00:10:52,389
-- Hello. -- Hi.

204
00:10:52,462 --> 00:10:55,727
They created lnfolink sort of an online trading system

205
00:10:55,799 --> 00:10:58,029
for swapping international secrets.

206
00:11:00,937 --> 00:11:02,529
Hi.

207
00:11:02,605 --> 00:11:04,163
Oh hey.

208
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,537
Hello.

209
00:11:05,608 --> 00:11:06,472
Champagne?

210
00:11:06,543 --> 00:11:07,601
Can't have any of that.

211
00:11:07,677 --> 00:11:09,338
Sorry.

212
00:11:11,348 --> 00:11:14,340
Something doesn't feel right.

213
00:11:14,417 --> 00:11:16,112
No wonder -- your buddy's here --

214
00:11:16,186 --> 00:11:17,881
your buddy with the weird laugh.

215
00:11:17,954 --> 00:11:19,148
He does not have a weird laugh.

216
00:11:19,222 --> 00:11:22,521
We were just... talking about you.

217
00:11:22,592 --> 00:11:23,524
Really?

218
00:11:25,895 --> 00:11:27,863
Wow. You look great Carmen.

219
00:11:27,931 --> 00:11:30,297
-- You want to dance? -- Sure.

220
00:11:30,367 --> 00:11:32,733
I don't think that's a good idea Gary.

221
00:11:32,802 --> 00:11:35,498
Family rules say you need to ask my father's permission.

222
00:11:35,572 --> 00:11:38,302
You know you should have had that suit tailored Juni.

223
00:11:38,375 --> 00:11:40,036
It's bunching up around your gut,

224
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:41,839
and it makes your head look way too big.

225
00:11:41,911 --> 00:11:44,744
You have to excuse my little brother.

226
00:11:44,814 --> 00:11:48,045
He's still a little upset about the...Juggler incident.

227
00:11:48,118 --> 00:11:49,642
A good agent controls his temper.

228
00:11:53,156 --> 00:11:54,714
Just be glad my dad isn't here.

229
00:11:54,791 --> 00:11:57,021
He gets really psycho about this sort of thing.

230
00:11:58,228 --> 00:11:59,957
Hi Dad.

231
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:02,055
Um you remember Gary. He's in our organization.

232
00:12:02,132 --> 00:12:04,498
I was just asking your daughter for a dance.

233
00:12:04,567 --> 00:12:06,091
You know how to dance?

234
00:12:06,169 --> 00:12:07,193
Fairly well sir.

235
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:08,362
What kind of dances?

236
00:12:08,438 --> 00:12:09,666
All types of dances.

237
00:12:09,739 --> 00:12:11,070
-- What about tango? -- Yes.

238
00:12:11,141 --> 00:12:12,267
-- Mambo? -- Fairly well.

239
00:12:12,342 --> 00:12:13,502
-- Rumba? -- Yes.

240
00:12:13,576 --> 00:12:14,668
-- Cha-cha-cha? -- Seven steps.

241
00:12:14,744 --> 00:12:15,733
-- Bossa nova? -- Mm-hmm.

242
00:12:15,812 --> 00:12:16,938
-- Merengue? -- Of course.

243
00:12:22,318 --> 00:12:23,580
What about waltz?

244
00:12:23,653 --> 00:12:26,622
Y-Yeah I can waltz.

245
00:12:26,689 --> 00:12:28,088
Show me.

246
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:32,621
Right.

247
00:12:39,436 --> 00:12:40,801
Something like that.

248
00:12:42,205 --> 00:12:44,605
All right.

249
00:12:44,674 --> 00:12:46,437
You can go to dance.

250
00:12:51,181 --> 00:12:53,809
Watch your older sister.

251
00:13:15,138 --> 00:13:16,127
Alexandra?

252
00:13:16,206 --> 00:13:17,138
Yes?

253
00:13:17,207 --> 00:13:18,834
What are you doing in there?

254
00:13:18,908 --> 00:13:20,603
Dancing.

255
00:13:20,677 --> 00:13:23,544
Do you always carry this many Secret Service around?

256
00:13:23,613 --> 00:13:25,410
My dad's idea --

257
00:13:25,482 --> 00:13:28,940
he's gotten a little...paranoid.

258
00:13:29,018 --> 00:13:33,455
Well would you dance... with me?

259
00:13:33,523 --> 00:13:34,820
No.

260
00:13:36,092 --> 00:13:38,253
All right, hold on a second guys.

261
00:13:38,328 --> 00:13:39,852
Level 2 -- break it up!

262
00:13:42,832 --> 00:13:44,493
Why not?

263
00:13:46,169 --> 00:13:48,603
I only dance...

264
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:50,104
ballet.

265
00:13:51,374 --> 00:13:55,435
What an incredible coincidence.

266
00:13:57,247 --> 00:13:58,839
So do l.

267
00:14:28,444 --> 00:14:30,002
Well Juni I must say,

268
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:32,240
you're a man of many talents.

269
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:39,078
One tries.

270
00:14:41,891 --> 00:14:45,190
Uh could you find your seats? We're ready to start.

271
00:14:48,398 --> 00:14:50,491
I must go.

272
00:14:56,439 --> 00:14:57,701
Ladies and gentlemen,

273
00:14:57,774 --> 00:14:59,833
the president of the United States.

274
00:15:04,514 --> 00:15:05,572
Thank you.

275
00:15:08,585 --> 00:15:09,779
I am proud of the O.S.S.

276
00:15:09,853 --> 00:15:12,048
and their newly formed Spy Kids division.

277
00:15:12,122 --> 00:15:14,886
For their outstanding accomplishments yesterday.

278
00:15:14,958 --> 00:15:17,119
Gary and Gerti Giggles

279
00:15:17,193 --> 00:15:18,683
not only saved my daughter...

280
00:15:18,762 --> 00:15:21,424
What is he talking about?! I saved her!

281
00:15:21,498 --> 00:15:22,726
Juni...

282
00:15:22,799 --> 00:15:26,257
But more importantly, if not most importantly,

283
00:15:26,336 --> 00:15:29,601
they safely retrieved the Transmooker device

284
00:15:29,672 --> 00:15:32,232
that my daughter accidentally took from my office

285
00:15:32,308 --> 00:15:33,400
earlier that day.

286
00:15:34,644 --> 00:15:36,908
Now it is my great pleasure to announce

287
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:39,448
the new director of the O.S.S....

288
00:15:41,317 --> 00:15:43,046
Gregor--

289
00:15:46,689 --> 00:15:48,247
...Donnagon Giggles.

290
00:15:58,034 --> 00:15:59,626
Gary and Gerti Giggles

291
00:15:59,702 --> 00:16:01,169
are the kind of agents we need

292
00:16:01,237 --> 00:16:03,762
to turn the O.S.S. around.

293
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:06,138
I am proud to award them

294
00:16:06,209 --> 00:16:09,975
these Level 1 badges,

295
00:16:10,046 --> 00:16:14,244
-- What? -- which will enable them to take on real missions,

296
00:16:14,317 --> 00:16:17,150
something challenging, like the Ukata assignment.

297
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:18,653
Yes!

298
00:16:18,721 --> 00:16:22,020
I wanted that assignment. This is so unfair.

299
00:16:22,092 --> 00:16:24,424
I am proud to claim them

300
00:16:24,494 --> 00:16:27,793
as our organization's top Spy Kid operatives!

301
00:16:27,864 --> 00:16:29,126
Something's not right.

302
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:30,496
And I'm also proud

303
00:16:30,567 --> 00:16:33,502
to claim them of course,

304
00:16:33,570 --> 00:16:35,504
as my children.

305
00:16:35,572 --> 00:16:36,800
This is all wrong.

306
00:16:36,873 --> 00:16:39,103
To our Spy Kids.

307
00:16:39,175 --> 00:16:40,836
-- To our Spy Kids. -- To our Spy Kids. -- To our Spy Kids.

308
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:42,468
To our Spy Kids.

309
00:16:55,592 --> 00:16:57,059
This -- ugh! Ohh.

310
00:17:08,338 --> 00:17:09,703
Secure the perimeter!

311
00:17:11,274 --> 00:17:12,366
Sleepers.

312
00:17:12,442 --> 00:17:16,208
They're after the Transmooker device!

313
00:17:33,396 --> 00:17:34,363
Take 'em down.

314
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:44,764
-- Pull! -- Pull!

315
00:17:45,909 --> 00:17:47,399
-- Whoa! -- Whoa!

316
00:18:37,827 --> 00:18:39,556
Get off squirt.

317
00:18:44,334 --> 00:18:46,393
Give me that back!

318
00:20:08,284 --> 00:20:09,512
-- You all right sir? -- Yeah.

319
00:20:13,623 --> 00:20:15,090
Come here!

320
00:20:15,158 --> 00:20:16,489
Juni get off of him!

321
00:20:22,765 --> 00:20:24,892
No no. They took the Transmooker device!

322
00:20:24,967 --> 00:20:27,834
They took the Transmooker device!

323
00:20:51,494 --> 00:20:54,486
The following Spy Kid cadets

324
00:20:54,564 --> 00:20:57,226
please report to the psychic abilities seminar --

325
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:59,734
Mike Cardenas and Daniel Duluth.

326
00:21:03,473 --> 00:21:05,373
-- It's my turn too. -- Are you sure?

327
00:21:05,441 --> 00:21:07,671
All right your last name is?

328
00:21:12,348 --> 00:21:14,145
Hold on a second.

329
00:21:14,217 --> 00:21:16,117
I had the Transmooker in my hand,

330
00:21:16,185 --> 00:21:17,277
but you know Juni --

331
00:21:17,353 --> 00:21:19,321
he wanted to claim it for himself.

332
00:21:19,389 --> 00:21:21,914
-- Okay that should do it. Thank you son. -- Right.

333
00:21:21,991 --> 00:21:25,757
If that Transmooker device falls into the wrong hands...

334
00:21:25,828 --> 00:21:27,318
we're doomed.

335
00:21:27,397 --> 00:21:29,661
Thank you Mr. President. That'll be all.

336
00:21:29,732 --> 00:21:31,165
We're doomed!

337
00:21:31,234 --> 00:21:33,395
Understood sir.

338
00:21:55,057 --> 00:21:56,490
Here.

339
00:22:10,673 --> 00:22:13,335
Man: "Floop's Fooglie"...

340
00:22:13,409 --> 00:22:16,378
Starring Minion...

341
00:22:16,446 --> 00:22:18,812
and Carmenita...

342
00:22:23,286 --> 00:22:25,083
Thanks.

343
00:22:34,297 --> 00:22:36,731
I was fired.

344
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,131
I know.

345
00:22:38,201 --> 00:22:40,692
I hacked into the O.S.S. data files

346
00:22:40,770 --> 00:22:42,795
and saw the news.

347
00:22:42,872 --> 00:22:44,999
It was probably my fault, I suppose.

348
00:22:45,074 --> 00:22:47,235
I'm sorry.

349
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:49,540
Well I guess that's that.

350
00:22:49,612 --> 00:22:52,479
Let's go to the tree house. I got an idea.

351
00:22:55,785 --> 00:22:57,218
I guess I could always set up

352
00:22:57,287 --> 00:23:00,688
a small detective agency out here or something.

353
00:23:00,757 --> 00:23:03,055
You're thinking small again Juni.

354
00:23:03,126 --> 00:23:05,424
The old tree house --

355
00:23:05,495 --> 00:23:07,986
needs another helicopter pad.

356
00:23:08,064 --> 00:23:10,259
It needs a paint job, is what it needs.

357
00:23:20,310 --> 00:23:22,244
Your name?

358
00:23:22,312 --> 00:23:25,543
Carmen Elizabeth Juanita Echo Sky Brava Cortez.

359
00:23:25,615 --> 00:23:27,048
Your name?

360
00:23:27,116 --> 00:23:30,017
Juni Rocket Racer Rebelde Cortez.

361
00:23:38,628 --> 00:23:39,856
You know...

362
00:23:39,929 --> 00:23:42,693
I'm kind of looking forward to retirement,

363
00:23:42,765 --> 00:23:47,293
get back to all the projects and dreams I left behind.

364
00:23:47,370 --> 00:23:49,895
Oh stop it Juni.

365
00:23:53,109 --> 00:23:55,543
Look do you want your job back or not?

366
00:23:55,612 --> 00:23:57,910
That's right -- reinstated Level 2.

367
00:23:57,981 --> 00:24:00,916
So now we can get back the missing Transmooker.

368
00:24:00,984 --> 00:24:02,076
How?

369
00:24:14,631 --> 00:24:17,566
Looks like Gary and Gerti are about to get briefed

370
00:24:17,634 --> 00:24:19,101
on the Ukata assignment.

371
00:24:19,168 --> 00:24:21,068
We should listen in.

372
00:24:23,206 --> 00:24:25,299
Is R.A.L.P.H. still at your office?

373
00:24:25,375 --> 00:24:28,435
If they haven't cleaned it out yet.

374
00:24:38,521 --> 00:24:41,149
R.A.L.P.H., get to the briefing room.

375
00:24:41,224 --> 00:24:44,682
We need you to spy on Gary and Gerti.

376
00:24:44,761 --> 00:24:47,093
Make sure no one sees you.

377
00:25:26,069 --> 00:25:28,105
There is a Bermuda Triangle of sorts

378
00:25:28,105 --> 00:25:30,402
off the coast of Madagascar.

379
00:25:30,473 --> 00:25:32,236
As you may remember, this is an area

380
00:25:32,308 --> 00:25:35,539
where some of our O.S.S. cargo ships have been disappearing.

381
00:25:35,611 --> 00:25:36,908
Good boy R.A.L.P.H.

382
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:38,538
The survivors of these disappearances

383
00:25:38,614 --> 00:25:41,242
tell delusional tales

384
00:25:41,317 --> 00:25:44,514
of a mysterious island populated by strange creatures.

385
00:25:44,587 --> 00:25:48,148
Obviously no land mass is located anywhere near there,

386
00:25:48,224 --> 00:25:51,421
so these tales were dismissed and the agents fired.

387
00:25:51,494 --> 00:25:52,825
However...

388
00:25:52,895 --> 00:25:55,523
the magnet ship that captured the Transmooker device

389
00:25:55,598 --> 00:25:59,500
was last seen in this same area.

390
00:25:59,569 --> 00:26:01,434
So we need a small ship,

391
00:26:01,504 --> 00:26:03,699
piloted by two small agents

392
00:26:03,773 --> 00:26:05,673
to go in and take a closer look.

393
00:26:05,742 --> 00:26:08,711
If you find anything out of the ordinary,

394
00:26:08,778 --> 00:26:10,336
you return,

395
00:26:10,413 --> 00:26:12,210
you report it back here.

396
00:26:12,281 --> 00:26:13,612
-- We accept. -- We accept.

397
00:26:13,683 --> 00:26:14,877
You bet we accept.

398
00:26:15,685 --> 00:26:17,676
Come home R.A.L.P.H. Good work.

399
00:26:19,022 --> 00:26:20,512
It's a great assignment,

400
00:26:20,590 --> 00:26:23,354
but Gary and Gerti have it, and I'm fired.

401
00:26:23,426 --> 00:26:25,724
And I'm reassigning you to the O.S.S.

402
00:26:25,795 --> 00:26:28,355
-- Don't tell me you're hacking into -- -- Already done.

403
00:26:29,499 --> 00:26:30,466
Level 2 status --

404
00:26:30,533 --> 00:26:32,967
reinstated.

405
00:26:33,036 --> 00:26:34,628
Carmen you can't do this.

406
00:26:34,704 --> 00:26:37,696
I already did it. I'd take it one step further.

407
00:26:37,774 --> 00:26:39,969
We're assigning ourselves to the Ukata assignment.

408
00:26:40,043 --> 00:26:43,274
I'm programming a new destination for Gary and Gerti.

409
00:26:43,346 --> 00:26:46,315
Now that, I got to be a part of.

410
00:26:50,553 --> 00:26:52,384
Woman: State your name please.

411
00:26:52,455 --> 00:26:54,548
Gary Giggles.

412
00:26:54,624 --> 00:26:56,421
Access denied.

413
00:26:56,492 --> 00:26:58,926
It knows you're not him.

414
00:27:00,296 --> 00:27:01,320
Confirmed.

415
00:27:03,833 --> 00:27:05,562
New destination?

416
00:27:05,635 --> 00:27:07,432
How about...

417
00:27:07,503 --> 00:27:09,300
Gobi Desert?

418
00:27:09,372 --> 00:27:10,396
Stop it Juni.

419
00:27:10,473 --> 00:27:11,735
What?

420
00:27:11,808 --> 00:27:14,140
Don't want your boyfriend to go so far away?

421
00:27:14,210 --> 00:27:15,234
He's not my boyfriend.

422
00:27:15,311 --> 00:27:16,801
Okay then.

423
00:27:16,879 --> 00:27:18,346
Destination confirmed.

424
00:27:18,414 --> 00:27:20,006
There. What did we just do again?

425
00:27:20,083 --> 00:27:21,948
We're gonna get the Transmooker device back

426
00:27:22,018 --> 00:27:23,610
so we can clear your name.

427
00:27:23,686 --> 00:27:25,119
We just have to solve the case

428
00:27:25,188 --> 00:27:27,088
before anybody finds out what we're up to.

429
00:27:27,156 --> 00:27:29,624
Are you with me?

430
00:27:29,692 --> 00:27:30,954
Okay.

431
00:27:31,027 --> 00:27:31,959
Then let's go.

432
00:27:40,336 --> 00:27:42,804
Hello?

433
00:27:44,907 --> 00:27:47,967
Hello?

434
00:27:48,044 --> 00:27:49,773
Hey what are you doing up there?!

435
00:27:49,846 --> 00:27:51,643
Sorry we thought you were somebody else.

436
00:27:51,714 --> 00:27:52,703
Who gave you a key?

437
00:27:52,782 --> 00:27:54,613
Did you forget who built you this place?

438
00:27:57,553 --> 00:27:59,180
Come down from there.

439
00:28:05,294 --> 00:28:07,524
I brought you all-new gadgets.

440
00:28:07,597 --> 00:28:10,191
Check it out -- the very latest spy watch --

441
00:28:10,266 --> 00:28:11,631
total communication center,

442
00:28:11,701 --> 00:28:13,168
right there on your wrist.

443
00:28:13,236 --> 00:28:15,761
Cellphone lnternet access, satellite TV --

444
00:28:15,838 --> 00:28:17,396
you name it.

445
00:28:17,473 --> 00:28:19,407
That baby will do everything but tell you what time it is.

446
00:28:19,475 --> 00:28:20,965
It doesn't tell time?

447
00:28:21,043 --> 00:28:23,511
No there was so much stuffed into it,

448
00:28:23,579 --> 00:28:25,308
there was no more room for the clock.

449
00:28:25,381 --> 00:28:26,678
Cool.

450
00:28:26,749 --> 00:28:28,046
Are you sure these are new?

451
00:28:28,117 --> 00:28:29,982
We can't be running around with outdated equipment.

452
00:28:30,052 --> 00:28:32,316
Close your eyes and hold out your wrist.

453
00:28:32,388 --> 00:28:34,015
I'm gonna give you

454
00:28:34,090 --> 00:28:37,321
the one gadget you should always carry.

455
00:28:37,393 --> 00:28:39,361
A rubber band?

456
00:28:39,428 --> 00:28:41,419
No it's a Machete elastic wonder.

457
00:28:41,497 --> 00:28:43,089
It's a rubber band.

458
00:28:43,166 --> 00:28:45,930
Yeah but it's also the world's greatest gadget --

459
00:28:46,002 --> 00:28:48,402
999 uses...

460
00:28:48,471 --> 00:28:49,870
and the important thing

461
00:28:49,939 --> 00:28:53,397
is you have to figure out what those uses are...with this.

462
00:28:53,476 --> 00:28:54,602
He's right.

463
00:28:54,677 --> 00:28:57,202
Use number one -- a stylish bracelet.

464
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:58,713
Use number two...

465
00:29:01,984 --> 00:29:03,781
I'm gonna make a fortune with these.

466
00:29:12,628 --> 00:29:14,823
Are you sure this is going to work?

467
00:29:14,897 --> 00:29:16,159
Just be cool.

468
00:29:16,231 --> 00:29:19,689
As far as anybody knows, you're back on the force.

469
00:29:19,768 --> 00:29:21,030
Hey Uncle Felix.

470
00:29:21,103 --> 00:29:22,798
Oh.

471
00:29:22,871 --> 00:29:24,805
I'm not your uncle.

472
00:29:24,873 --> 00:29:26,602
I know. It's just easier to call you that.

473
00:29:26,675 --> 00:29:28,734
Um you don't mind do you?

474
00:29:28,811 --> 00:29:30,779
Of course not.

475
00:29:32,047 --> 00:29:33,776
Well welcome back Juni.

476
00:29:33,849 --> 00:29:35,874
Says here you were reinstated.

477
00:29:35,951 --> 00:29:37,885
Sure does doesn't it?

478
00:29:37,953 --> 00:29:39,887
He was fired and rehired all in the same day.

479
00:29:39,955 --> 00:29:41,115
Okay.

480
00:29:41,190 --> 00:29:43,385
Let me bring up the keys to the DragonSpy Five.

481
00:29:45,727 --> 00:29:47,490
Cake.

482
00:29:47,563 --> 00:29:49,121
6 o'clock.

483
00:29:53,135 --> 00:29:55,831
Wow. You're looking good with the new gear Carmen.

484
00:29:55,904 --> 00:29:58,668
-- Their latest stuff. -- Very cool...

485
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:00,640
only we had that weeks ago.

486
00:30:00,709 --> 00:30:02,802
Here's what's really new.

487
00:30:02,878 --> 00:30:04,402
Nanotechnology --

488
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:07,472
everything you're wearing is right here on my wrist.

489
00:30:08,851 --> 00:30:11,285
It's superaccurate and oh so light.

490
00:30:12,354 --> 00:30:13,821
It even tells time.

491
00:30:13,889 --> 00:30:15,413
How did you get that?!

492
00:30:15,491 --> 00:30:16,822
Well it's all prototype, Juni.

493
00:30:16,892 --> 00:30:19,019
You can't be running around with those mass-produced gadgets.

494
00:30:19,094 --> 00:30:20,425
Just means everyone's got them.

495
00:30:20,496 --> 00:30:22,487
I always go with the prototype.

496
00:30:22,564 --> 00:30:24,555
-- Sure, they're a little...buggy,

497
00:30:24,633 --> 00:30:25,998
But I can deal.

498
00:30:26,068 --> 00:30:28,935
I-I accidentally squashed him

499
00:30:29,004 --> 00:30:31,029
on my way out of the O.S.S. building.

500
00:30:32,107 --> 00:30:33,438
Sorry about that.

501
00:30:33,509 --> 00:30:35,875
He was outdated anyway,

502
00:30:35,944 --> 00:30:37,707
so think of it as a mercy killing.

503
00:30:41,450 --> 00:30:42,917
Gary and Gerti Giggles,

504
00:30:42,985 --> 00:30:45,749
you have assignment SElKJu9.

505
00:30:45,821 --> 00:30:47,220
Good luck.

506
00:30:48,423 --> 00:30:51,187
Don't hurt yourselves with that outdated gear.

507
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:54,252
Remember an agent is only as good as his gadgets.

508
00:30:56,198 --> 00:30:57,358
What?

509
00:30:57,432 --> 00:30:59,525
You have the Ukata assignment?

510
00:30:59,601 --> 00:31:01,831
Very nice.

511
00:31:01,904 --> 00:31:03,872
You'll love it.

512
00:31:07,543 --> 00:31:09,272
Thanks Uncle Felix.

513
00:31:10,779 --> 00:31:13,680
I'm not your uncle.

514
00:31:19,354 --> 00:31:22,187
Oh nice sub.

515
00:31:22,257 --> 00:31:25,852
Welcome to the DragonSpy DLX.

516
00:31:25,928 --> 00:31:28,396
Seems like they get more and more sophisticated

517
00:31:28,463 --> 00:31:29,760
each month.

518
00:31:29,831 --> 00:31:31,890
Everything is automated!

519
00:31:31,967 --> 00:31:33,935
Now picking your nose.

520
00:31:37,139 --> 00:31:39,198
Ugh little brothers.

521
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:49,211
Let's check our lunchboxes for mission updates.

522
00:32:04,733 --> 00:32:06,564
Sorry R.A.L.P.H.

523
00:32:06,635 --> 00:32:09,729
You were the best spy on the force.

524
00:32:09,805 --> 00:32:12,399
Juni leave it alone. He's dead.

525
00:32:12,474 --> 00:32:14,442
Thanks to your buddy Gary.

526
00:32:14,509 --> 00:32:15,806
It was an accident.

527
00:32:15,877 --> 00:32:17,811
You like him and believe him?

528
00:32:19,181 --> 00:32:21,411
I don't like him... that much.

529
00:32:29,324 --> 00:32:31,952
Gary's a bad guy Carmen.

530
00:32:32,027 --> 00:32:34,086
Maybe I know that.

531
00:32:34,162 --> 00:32:36,096
I think I can change him.

532
00:32:36,164 --> 00:32:38,894
I do not understand you.

533
00:32:38,967 --> 00:32:40,901
And you never will.

534
00:32:40,969 --> 00:32:42,937
French fry sir?

535
00:32:44,906 --> 00:32:46,271
Gimme that!

536
00:32:50,746 --> 00:32:54,910
Strange -- tales of a mysterious island,

537
00:32:54,983 --> 00:32:57,713
disappearing ships, mysterious creatures,

538
00:32:57,786 --> 00:32:59,981
and yet, no information anywhere

539
00:33:00,055 --> 00:33:02,114
on the O.S.S. cargo or the magnet ship.

540
00:33:02,190 --> 00:33:04,249
What's Donnagon doing there?

541
00:33:04,326 --> 00:33:06,453
He wasn't O.S.S. director yet.

542
00:33:06,528 --> 00:33:08,758
These are old O.S.S. secrets.

543
00:33:08,830 --> 00:33:12,391
And I know just the person we can call for advice.

544
00:33:14,169 --> 00:33:15,659
Who?

545
00:33:15,771 --> 00:33:18,001
# Who? #

546
00:33:18,073 --> 00:33:20,064
# What? #

547
00:33:20,142 --> 00:33:22,303
# When? #

548
00:33:22,377 --> 00:33:24,470
# Where? #

549
00:33:24,546 --> 00:33:26,070
-- # Who? # -- # What? # -- # When? #

550
00:33:26,148 --> 00:33:27,445
-- # Where? # -- # And why? #

551
00:33:27,516 --> 00:33:28,710
# I delight in #

552
00:33:28,784 --> 00:33:31,617
-- # What... # -- # Do I intend to find? # -- # Find #

553
00:33:31,686 --> 00:33:33,051
# This time? #

554
00:33:33,121 --> 00:33:34,088
-- # Run around! # -- # Jumping down! #

555
00:33:34,156 --> 00:33:35,418
# Bounce and bound and... #

556
00:33:35,490 --> 00:33:36,752
# Find another way to duck and hide #

557
00:33:36,825 --> 00:33:37,757
# This isle of... #

558
00:33:37,826 --> 00:33:40,090
# Dreams #

559
00:33:45,433 --> 00:33:47,060
Hello?

560
00:33:47,135 --> 00:33:48,397
Yes.

561
00:33:48,470 --> 00:33:50,301
One moment please.

562
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:53,805
Cut!!

563
00:33:58,747 --> 00:34:01,181
Who is it again?

564
00:34:02,684 --> 00:34:06,051
Juni Cortez!

565
00:34:06,121 --> 00:34:07,850
What can I do for you?

566
00:34:07,923 --> 00:34:10,153
I mean, you've done so much for me.

567
00:34:10,225 --> 00:34:11,590
Your robot counterparts

568
00:34:11,660 --> 00:34:14,026
are the surprise hit characters of my show!

569
00:34:14,095 --> 00:34:15,722
Say hello.

570
00:34:15,797 --> 00:34:17,822
-- # Hello # -- # Hello #

571
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,867
Actually Carmen wants a word with Mr. Minion.

572
00:34:21,937 --> 00:34:24,303
Oh. He's right here.

573
00:34:30,812 --> 00:34:32,939
Minion is practicing a 4-part harmony.

574
00:34:33,014 --> 00:34:35,812
-- You have one minute. -- # Hmmm # -- # Hmmm # -- # Hmmm #

575
00:34:35,884 --> 00:34:38,546
-- # Hmmm # -- # Hmmm # -- # Hmmm # -- # Hmmm #

576
00:34:40,088 --> 00:34:41,419
Bueno?

577
00:34:41,489 --> 00:34:43,150
How you doing Minion?

578
00:34:43,225 --> 00:34:45,921
Things are a little Floopy around here for my taste,

579
00:34:45,994 --> 00:34:48,019
but it's a living.

580
00:34:48,096 --> 00:34:50,530
I need some information on your favorite subject --

581
00:34:50,599 --> 00:34:51,861
the O.S.S.

582
00:34:51,933 --> 00:34:53,195
I need to make a call.

583
00:34:53,268 --> 00:34:55,998
Okay you ready?

584
00:34:56,071 --> 00:34:57,436
Ukata...

585
00:34:57,505 --> 00:34:59,530
Transmooker...

586
00:34:59,608 --> 00:35:01,473
The president's daughter is unavailable.

587
00:35:01,543 --> 00:35:02,475
Manage.

588
00:35:02,544 --> 00:35:03,772
Press "1" to record.

589
00:35:03,845 --> 00:35:05,244
Mean anything to you?

590
00:35:05,313 --> 00:35:08,305
Smells like the work of Donnagon Giggles.

591
00:35:09,718 --> 00:35:11,709
He had first contact with the Transmooker technology.

592
00:35:11,786 --> 00:35:13,947
You think Donnagon's the one behind all this?

593
00:35:14,022 --> 00:35:16,081
You're talking to a man with four heads.

594
00:35:16,157 --> 00:35:17,715
Trust me -- the guy is dirt.

595
00:35:17,792 --> 00:35:19,282
What should we look for?

596
00:35:19,361 --> 00:35:21,591
First find the island.

597
00:35:21,663 --> 00:35:24,063
Then find the lsland Man.

598
00:35:24,132 --> 00:35:26,032
That would have been Donnagon's contact.

599
00:35:26,101 --> 00:35:27,068
Okay.

600
00:35:27,135 --> 00:35:28,329
Thanks Minion.

601
00:35:28,403 --> 00:35:30,564
Be a good girl and swat your brother for me.

602
00:35:30,639 --> 00:35:32,072
Oh I will.

603
00:35:34,809 --> 00:35:36,470
Something's wrong! Take the wheel!

604
00:35:36,544 --> 00:35:38,478
Got to go. Good luck!

605
00:35:38,546 --> 00:35:41,014
Slow down! We're nearing destination zone.

606
00:35:41,082 --> 00:35:43,676
The radius where all the disappearances occurred is right...

607
00:35:44,719 --> 00:35:45,743
Here!

608
00:35:49,824 --> 00:35:51,519
We've been shut down!

609
00:35:51,593 --> 00:35:54,585
Hold onto something!

610
00:35:56,131 --> 00:35:57,496
Ugh!

611
00:36:05,507 --> 00:36:09,170
All power is off -- even the emergency power.

612
00:36:10,612 --> 00:36:12,773
My flashlight doesn't even work.

613
00:36:12,847 --> 00:36:14,371
We're stuck aren't we?

614
00:36:16,518 --> 00:36:18,145
Let's get out of here.

615
00:36:19,888 --> 00:36:22,254
Rebreathers.

616
00:36:22,324 --> 00:36:24,053
Rebreathers.

617
00:36:24,125 --> 00:36:25,956
You got to do it by hand.

618
00:36:26,027 --> 00:36:27,460
What next?

619
00:36:29,464 --> 00:36:32,058
Nope. Hand Carmen.

620
00:36:36,338 --> 00:36:37,999
Unbelievable.

621
00:36:38,073 --> 00:36:40,303
Low-tech!

622
00:36:46,881 --> 00:36:48,473
Here we go.

623
00:37:14,442 --> 00:37:17,411
Should we travel light or heavy?

624
00:37:17,479 --> 00:37:19,447
We may not be coming back down here.

625
00:37:19,514 --> 00:37:21,846
Let's go heavy.

626
00:37:21,916 --> 00:37:23,975
Inflate-a-suits?

627
00:37:24,052 --> 00:37:26,179
We don't have much choice.

628
00:37:30,258 --> 00:37:31,190
At least the masks work.

629
00:37:33,094 --> 00:37:36,586
I think it's because they're valve-operated, not electrical-based.

630
00:37:36,664 --> 00:37:38,097
It's so strange.

631
00:37:38,166 --> 00:37:40,066
Good luck.

632
00:37:40,135 --> 00:37:41,602
You too!

633
00:37:41,669 --> 00:37:43,500
Stay close!

634
00:38:03,324 --> 00:38:04,586
-- Ugh! -- Ugh!

635
00:38:04,659 --> 00:38:07,253
Ugh. Oh great.

636
00:38:07,328 --> 00:38:08,727
I'm fat!

637
00:38:08,797 --> 00:38:10,458
Was it supposed to do this?!

638
00:38:10,532 --> 00:38:12,796
It has an electrical automatic shutoff

639
00:38:12,867 --> 00:38:14,334
which didn't work.

640
00:38:14,402 --> 00:38:17,633
Luckily we ran out of air before the suits exploded.

641
00:38:17,705 --> 00:38:20,538
Well we can still laugh.

642
00:38:20,608 --> 00:38:22,371
At what?

643
00:38:22,444 --> 00:38:26,107
At whatever you can imagine Gary and Gerti are doing

644
00:38:26,181 --> 00:38:27,478
right about now.

645
00:38:27,549 --> 00:38:29,608
-- Ugh. -- Ugh!

646
00:38:37,992 --> 00:38:39,254
Gerti where are we?!

647
00:38:39,327 --> 00:38:40,726
Well...

648
00:38:40,795 --> 00:38:42,786
according to my coordinates,

649
00:38:42,864 --> 00:38:44,491
we are...

650
00:38:44,566 --> 00:38:46,090
I think that --

651
00:38:46,167 --> 00:38:47,259
Ugh!

652
00:38:49,337 --> 00:38:50,804
-- Ugh! -- Ohh!

653
00:38:50,872 --> 00:38:51,861
Ugh!

654
00:38:54,442 --> 00:38:56,933
Camel poop!

655
00:38:58,113 --> 00:39:00,946
Someone's gonna pay!!

656
00:39:01,015 --> 00:39:03,176
Cordezes...

657
00:39:08,389 --> 00:39:09,788
I like your new office.

658
00:39:09,857 --> 00:39:12,223
It's smaller...cozy.

659
00:39:12,293 --> 00:39:15,694
Especially...smaller.

660
00:39:16,898 --> 00:39:18,559
Oh!

661
00:39:18,633 --> 00:39:20,294
So many successful missions.

662
00:39:20,368 --> 00:39:21,995
Amazing isn't it?

663
00:39:22,070 --> 00:39:23,628
Remember this one?

664
00:39:23,705 --> 00:39:25,866
Oh. Which mission is that?

665
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:27,737
Mexico.

666
00:39:27,809 --> 00:39:29,743
Of course.

667
00:39:29,811 --> 00:39:31,802
Hmm.

668
00:39:31,879 --> 00:39:33,710
Actually, that was the one mission

669
00:39:33,781 --> 00:39:35,408
we never accomplished.

670
00:39:35,483 --> 00:39:36,415
Ingrid...

671
00:39:36,484 --> 00:39:39,078
don't start with your parents again.

672
00:39:39,153 --> 00:39:41,246
It's funny you should mention them.

673
00:39:41,322 --> 00:39:44,723
No. When I mention your parents it is the exact opposite of funny.

674
00:39:44,792 --> 00:39:47,386
Doesn't it bother you that we never got their full blessing?

675
00:39:47,462 --> 00:39:50,022
-- Frankly you deserve another chance to show them -- -- All right all right.

676
00:39:50,098 --> 00:39:52,760
Invite them if you want, but I won't be here.

677
00:39:52,834 --> 00:39:55,701
Tell them that I had a -- I had to go on another mission,

678
00:39:55,770 --> 00:39:58,500
that -- that we're having a little problem on the moon.

679
00:39:58,573 --> 00:40:00,598
My father loves the moon.

680
00:40:07,115 --> 00:40:10,243
You invited them already, didn't you?

681
00:40:10,318 --> 00:40:11,910
Mm...define "invite."

682
00:40:11,986 --> 00:40:13,112
Cortezes.

683
00:40:13,187 --> 00:40:14,154
What?!

684
00:40:14,222 --> 00:40:17,214
I have some bad news. May I come in?

685
00:40:17,291 --> 00:40:18,451
-- Uh. -- Uh.

686
00:40:18,526 --> 00:40:19,515
-- Certainly sir. -- Yes sir.

687
00:40:19,594 --> 00:40:20,583
Great.

688
00:40:28,002 --> 00:40:29,867
Here he is.

689
00:40:37,311 --> 00:40:39,609
Two of our Spy Kid operatives

690
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:41,443
are lost on the Ukata assignment.

691
00:40:41,516 --> 00:40:42,813
Your children had that assignment.

692
00:40:42,884 --> 00:40:44,374
I'm so sorry Donnagon. How can we help?

693
00:40:44,452 --> 00:40:46,682
Actually, my children are safe

694
00:40:46,754 --> 00:40:49,814
somewhere in the Gobi Desert, I believe.

695
00:40:49,891 --> 00:40:52,086
Uh I'm sorry to say that Carmen and Juni

696
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:54,924
are somehow the ones on the Ukata assignment --

697
00:40:54,996 --> 00:40:56,588
a computing error of some kind.

698
00:40:56,664 --> 00:40:58,154
-- Communications? -- None.

699
00:40:58,232 --> 00:40:59,995
Their DragonSpy ship doesn't show up

700
00:41:00,068 --> 00:41:01,660
on radar or satellite.

701
00:41:01,736 --> 00:41:03,169
Greg lngrid,

702
00:41:03,237 --> 00:41:05,933
you guys risked your lives once before to save me.

703
00:41:06,007 --> 00:41:07,406
Let me go now

704
00:41:07,475 --> 00:41:10,967
and personally bring your children back.

705
00:41:11,045 --> 00:41:12,273
No. Thank you.

706
00:41:12,346 --> 00:41:13,745
Thank you Donnagon,

707
00:41:13,815 --> 00:41:16,181
but respectfully, we have to do this ourselves.

708
00:41:16,250 --> 00:41:18,411
If you could provide tactical backup

709
00:41:18,486 --> 00:41:20,511
and surveillance support of our efforts,

710
00:41:20,588 --> 00:41:21,816
we'll leave immediately.

711
00:41:21,889 --> 00:41:22,947
Okay yeah.

712
00:41:31,365 --> 00:41:33,697
Uh lngrid...

713
00:41:33,768 --> 00:41:36,498
I know this may be a bad time but um...

714
00:41:37,738 --> 00:41:39,467
Your parents are here.

715
00:42:00,261 --> 00:42:02,422
But you guys told me you were coming next Tuesday.

716
00:42:02,497 --> 00:42:04,556
This is a very dangerous assignment,

717
00:42:04,632 --> 00:42:06,122
and you have to wait here.

718
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:07,394
Well we want to help.

719
00:42:07,468 --> 00:42:10,130
Don't worry.

720
00:42:10,204 --> 00:42:12,297
You taught me everything I know.

721
00:42:12,373 --> 00:42:14,398
Yes...

722
00:42:14,475 --> 00:42:18,309
but not everything we know.

723
00:42:18,379 --> 00:42:20,370
Of course not Dad. See you in a few hours.

724
00:42:20,448 --> 00:42:22,143
Thanks honey.

725
00:42:34,395 --> 00:42:36,693
I still don't like him.

726
00:42:39,334 --> 00:42:41,359
Juni... Juni...

727
00:42:41,436 --> 00:42:43,563
was that there before?

728
00:42:46,874 --> 00:42:50,435
That wasn't there a minute ago was it?

729
00:42:50,511 --> 00:42:53,173
Are you kicking me?!

730
00:42:53,247 --> 00:42:54,544
I'm way over here!

731
00:42:54,615 --> 00:42:58,676
I felt something against my foot.

732
00:42:58,753 --> 00:43:01,654
There's something under me! Come look!

733
00:43:01,723 --> 00:43:02,690
Uhh.

734
00:43:02,757 --> 00:43:04,588
I don't see anything Juni.

735
00:43:04,659 --> 00:43:07,856
Let's just concentrate on getting to shore.

736
00:43:09,597 --> 00:43:12,259
Okay it's about 200 yards.

737
00:43:12,333 --> 00:43:15,928
If we kick steadily at one foot per kick,

738
00:43:16,003 --> 00:43:18,699
we'll reach it in um...

739
00:43:18,773 --> 00:43:22,641
25 minutes?

740
00:43:22,710 --> 00:43:24,610
I don't know.

741
00:43:24,679 --> 00:43:26,772
My calculator doesn't work.

742
00:43:27,815 --> 00:43:30,215
-- Whoa! -- Whoa!

743
00:43:30,284 --> 00:43:31,808
Juni what did you do?!

744
00:43:31,886 --> 00:43:34,252
The air's coming out of our suits!

745
00:43:34,322 --> 00:43:35,721
We're heading towards shore!

746
00:43:51,472 --> 00:43:53,736
"Travel heavy"!

747
00:43:55,777 --> 00:43:57,506
Good idea!

748
00:43:57,578 --> 00:43:59,102
All right.

749
00:43:59,180 --> 00:44:01,546
Give it a rest. Ugh. Ugh.

750
00:44:02,917 --> 00:44:05,750
Okay we're gonna set up a campsite,

751
00:44:05,820 --> 00:44:08,812
put up the tent, build a little fire.

752
00:44:08,890 --> 00:44:11,017
And roast marshmallows?

753
00:44:17,999 --> 00:44:19,591
I can't believe this!

754
00:44:19,667 --> 00:44:21,157
What happened?

755
00:44:21,235 --> 00:44:23,135
Nothing -- that's just it.

756
00:44:23,204 --> 00:44:24,899
That was supposed to make an instant campfire,

757
00:44:24,972 --> 00:44:26,462
and that was supposed to make a shelter.

758
00:44:27,608 --> 00:44:29,838
None of our gadgets work.

759
00:44:29,911 --> 00:44:32,812
You mean we have to use our heads?

760
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:34,507
Yes.

761
00:44:34,582 --> 00:44:36,777
Ouch.

762
00:44:42,590 --> 00:44:44,683
Big office...

763
00:44:46,661 --> 00:44:50,791
Director of the O.S.S.'s office.

764
00:44:50,865 --> 00:44:53,197
Big.

765
00:45:12,620 --> 00:45:14,554
Did you find the source of equal or greater power?

766
00:45:14,622 --> 00:45:16,487
It emanates from the north side of the island.

767
00:45:16,557 --> 00:45:17,888
Have you located the lsland Man?

768
00:45:17,959 --> 00:45:19,790
He's somewhere underground.

769
00:45:19,861 --> 00:45:22,329
Yeah well start digging. I'm on my way.

770
00:45:32,139 --> 00:45:34,164
Come on Juni.

771
00:45:34,242 --> 00:45:35,869
Let's go check out the island.

772
00:45:35,943 --> 00:45:37,410
I just set up camp.

773
00:45:37,478 --> 00:45:38,536
See?

774
00:45:42,083 --> 00:45:43,607
Sure wish Gary was here.

775
00:45:43,684 --> 00:45:46,676
He'd want to find out who was behind all this.

776
00:45:51,158 --> 00:45:54,127
Aw man!

777
00:45:54,195 --> 00:45:56,720
All right let's go.

778
00:46:00,034 --> 00:46:02,059
Wow!

779
00:46:02,136 --> 00:46:04,696
This place is amazing!

780
00:46:04,772 --> 00:46:06,797
Check out that rock!

781
00:46:08,309 --> 00:46:09,970
Looks like a hot dog.

782
00:46:10,044 --> 00:46:11,568
Uh-huh.

783
00:46:11,646 --> 00:46:14,911
Well I've seen enough. Let's go back to the beach.

784
00:46:16,017 --> 00:46:17,382
What?

785
00:46:17,451 --> 00:46:18,884
Listen.

786
00:46:23,491 --> 00:46:26,051
Ugh!

787
00:46:26,127 --> 00:46:27,492
Somebody here has power.

788
00:46:27,562 --> 00:46:30,554
We need to find out who and for what.

789
00:46:32,667 --> 00:46:34,601
Destination -- Ukata.

790
00:46:34,669 --> 00:46:38,105
Estimated time of arrival -- one minute and counting.

791
00:46:40,474 --> 00:46:41,941
How fast are we going?

792
00:46:43,177 --> 00:46:44,405
85 knots.

793
00:46:44,478 --> 00:46:46,969
Well...go faster.

794
00:46:47,048 --> 00:46:48,572
With pleasure.

795
00:46:51,218 --> 00:46:53,083
Faster.

796
00:46:55,856 --> 00:46:58,620
Faster.

797
00:46:58,693 --> 00:47:00,320
Can't go faster.

798
00:47:00,394 --> 00:47:01,486
Faster.

799
00:47:01,562 --> 00:47:02,927
I broke the fast thingy.

800
00:47:03,998 --> 00:47:05,431
Faster!

801
00:47:09,503 --> 00:47:11,869
-- Ohh. -- Aah.

802
00:47:11,939 --> 00:47:14,669
Aah.

803
00:47:14,742 --> 00:47:17,074
All right...

804
00:47:17,144 --> 00:47:19,135
now what?

805
00:47:22,283 --> 00:47:25,446
This is terrific.

806
00:47:25,519 --> 00:47:27,146
You know, this is just great.

807
00:47:27,221 --> 00:47:29,121
You really did it this time Gerti.

808
00:47:29,190 --> 00:47:31,317
Are you kicking me?

809
00:47:31,392 --> 00:47:34,953
No. I'm way over here, cheese ball.

810
00:47:36,998 --> 00:47:38,556
-- Aah! -- Aah!

811
00:47:38,633 --> 00:47:41,193
-- Aah! -- Aah!

812
00:47:41,268 --> 00:47:42,496
-- Aah! -- Aah!

813
00:47:51,746 --> 00:47:53,077
Aah!

814
00:47:57,418 --> 00:48:00,182
-- Uh. Uh. Uh. -- Uh. Uh.

815
00:48:00,254 --> 00:48:01,186
Ugh!

816
00:48:01,255 --> 00:48:02,586
Ohh!

817
00:48:02,657 --> 00:48:04,648
I'm gonna zap that sucker to bits!

818
00:48:04,725 --> 00:48:07,091
Come here!

819
00:48:11,832 --> 00:48:13,231
Wait!

820
00:48:15,102 --> 00:48:16,694
Save it for the Cortezes.

821
00:48:16,771 --> 00:48:17,897
Yeah...

822
00:48:17,972 --> 00:48:22,409
Excellent idea.

823
00:48:22,543 --> 00:48:25,376
I don't get it! I saw it go through this wall. I don't get it! I saw it go through this wall.

824
00:48:25,445 --> 00:48:27,413
What's your assessment Juni?

825
00:48:27,481 --> 00:48:29,506
I'd think better with food in my belly.

826
00:48:31,051 --> 00:48:33,212
I think we should go up there and check it out.

827
00:48:33,287 --> 00:48:35,118
Up there -- to the top of the volcano?

828
00:48:35,188 --> 00:48:36,450
Yep.

829
00:48:36,523 --> 00:48:39,185
Not even if my micrograpplers were working.

830
00:48:39,259 --> 00:48:40,783
Gary would be brave enough to do it.

831
00:48:40,861 --> 00:48:42,192
Nope.

832
00:48:42,262 --> 00:48:45,095
Nothing you can say can change my mind.

833
00:48:48,635 --> 00:48:51,126
-- What did you just say? -- I didn't.

834
00:48:54,007 --> 00:48:56,373
Race you to the top!

835
00:49:07,854 --> 00:49:09,446
-- Ugh! -- Ugh!

836
00:49:09,523 --> 00:49:11,787
Ugh! Ugh!

837
00:49:11,858 --> 00:49:13,792
Ugh! Oh!

838
00:49:13,860 --> 00:49:15,623
Ah. Volcano.

839
00:49:16,897 --> 00:49:19,798
Juni stay back.

840
00:49:21,535 --> 00:49:24,470
It's not active.

841
00:49:26,039 --> 00:49:27,006
Aah!

842
00:49:27,074 --> 00:49:28,098
Juni!

843
00:49:30,077 --> 00:49:31,135
Aah!

844
00:49:31,211 --> 00:49:32,337
Ohh!

845
00:49:32,412 --> 00:49:34,277
What are you waiting for?!

846
00:49:34,348 --> 00:49:35,838
Get me out of here!

847
00:49:35,916 --> 00:49:38,350
If my auto retractor was working,

848
00:49:38,418 --> 00:49:40,113
I'd get us both back up there!

849
00:49:40,187 --> 00:49:42,747
Uh. Okay. I'm gonna grab your hand.

850
00:49:42,823 --> 00:49:43,915
Ugh.

851
00:49:45,692 --> 00:49:46,784
-- Aah! -- Ohh!

852
00:49:48,495 --> 00:49:49,655
Okay. Ohh!

853
00:49:50,664 --> 00:49:52,598
-- Aah! -- Ugh!

854
00:49:52,666 --> 00:49:54,463
Oh! Aah!

855
00:49:54,534 --> 00:49:56,297
My cellphone!

856
00:49:56,370 --> 00:49:58,167
Ugh!

857
00:49:58,238 --> 00:50:00,001
Why'd you stop?!

858
00:50:00,073 --> 00:50:01,233
Something wrong?

859
00:50:01,308 --> 00:50:02,605
Close your eyes.

860
00:50:02,676 --> 00:50:04,473
Why?

861
00:50:06,279 --> 00:50:07,473
-- Aah! -- Aah!

862
00:50:07,547 --> 00:50:08,605
Juni!

863
00:50:08,682 --> 00:50:09,774
What?!

864
00:50:09,850 --> 00:50:11,647
I'm sorry!

865
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:29,794
How long have we been falling?

866
00:50:29,870 --> 00:50:31,394
I don't know.

867
00:50:31,471 --> 00:50:33,735
My watch doesn't tell time.

868
00:50:33,807 --> 00:50:35,536
Best guess?

869
00:50:35,609 --> 00:50:38,203
I'd say about three hours.

870
00:50:38,278 --> 00:50:40,542
Feels like four.

871
00:50:52,159 --> 00:50:55,185
How could you be eating at a time like this?!

872
00:50:55,262 --> 00:50:58,026
You know that tickling sensation you get when you fall?

873
00:50:58,098 --> 00:50:59,156
Of course.

874
00:50:59,232 --> 00:51:01,996
That pretty much went away after the first hour.

875
00:51:02,069 --> 00:51:03,730
Whoa!

876
00:51:03,804 --> 00:51:05,931
Waah!

877
00:51:06,006 --> 00:51:08,338
Aah!

878
00:51:08,408 --> 00:51:10,672
What happened?!

879
00:51:10,744 --> 00:51:13,440
I don't know! We're floating!

880
00:51:16,016 --> 00:51:17,916
Who are you?

881
00:51:17,984 --> 00:51:20,214
-- Do you see something? -- Over there hiding.

882
00:51:20,287 --> 00:51:21,515
What do you want?

883
00:51:21,588 --> 00:51:23,180
I want to get down.

884
00:51:23,256 --> 00:51:26,692
I'm Carmen Cortez, special agent of the O.S.S.

885
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:28,022
I'm Romero,

886
00:51:28,095 --> 00:51:32,259
sole inhabitant of this island of Leeke Leeke...

887
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:35,597
...sole human inhabitant, that is.

888
00:51:37,137 --> 00:51:38,468
And you are?

889
00:51:38,538 --> 00:51:40,096
Tired and hungry.

890
00:51:40,173 --> 00:51:42,334
Nice to meet you, Tired and Hungry.

891
00:51:44,377 --> 00:51:46,402
-- Ahh! -- Ugh! Ohh! Ohh! -- Careful! You'll crush my island!

892
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:47,970
Sorry.

893
00:51:48,048 --> 00:51:50,710
We just fell four hours. We're a little clumsy right now.

894
00:51:50,784 --> 00:51:53,582
You weren't falling. It was an illusion.

895
00:51:56,623 --> 00:51:58,420
Magic?

896
00:52:02,796 --> 00:52:04,457
Science.

897
00:52:08,168 --> 00:52:10,830
Quickly, we must get somewhere safe!

898
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:21,745
I'm a genetic specialist.

899
00:52:21,815 --> 00:52:24,978
I needed a controlled environment for my experiments.

900
00:52:25,051 --> 00:52:27,315
The creatures we've been hearing?

901
00:52:27,387 --> 00:52:29,617
My experiments...

902
00:52:29,689 --> 00:52:31,088
run amok.

903
00:52:31,158 --> 00:52:32,819
What happened?

904
00:52:36,830 --> 00:52:38,821
I thought I would make a fortune from it.

905
00:52:38,899 --> 00:52:41,766
Kids everywhere would have their own miniature zoos,

906
00:52:41,835 --> 00:52:44,633
right there in their bedrooms.

907
00:52:44,704 --> 00:52:47,366
A miniature zoo?

908
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:50,807
God's creatures... on a manageable scale.

909
00:52:57,317 --> 00:52:59,478
Unbelievable.

910
00:52:59,553 --> 00:53:02,044
"Romero's Zoo" -- I called it "Romero's Zoo" --

911
00:53:02,122 --> 00:53:04,454
genetically miniaturized animals.

912
00:53:04,524 --> 00:53:07,652
Lions tigers bears, penguins...

913
00:53:10,230 --> 00:53:11,288
Monkeys.

914
00:53:13,233 --> 00:53:14,791
Monkeys in a barrel.

915
00:53:14,868 --> 00:53:15,857
Careful.

916
00:53:17,103 --> 00:53:18,661
Careful.

917
00:53:22,642 --> 00:53:24,337
One day, I accidentally mixed up

918
00:53:24,411 --> 00:53:26,174
two or three different test tubes

919
00:53:26,246 --> 00:53:28,976
and created a new species...altogether.

920
00:53:38,291 --> 00:53:41,590
Romero's Zoo Too...

921
00:53:41,661 --> 00:53:45,563
an entirely new... miniature zoo...

922
00:53:45,632 --> 00:53:48,430
where each species is unlike

923
00:53:48,501 --> 00:53:51,095
any creature you've ever seen.

924
00:53:51,171 --> 00:53:52,502
Horse-fly?

925
00:53:54,040 --> 00:53:55,064
Uh-huh.

926
00:53:55,141 --> 00:53:56,938
Uh...cat-fish.

927
00:53:58,378 --> 00:53:59,310
Spider-monkey?

928
00:54:02,015 --> 00:54:03,107
Bull-frog.

929
00:54:04,417 --> 00:54:05,384
Uh...

930
00:54:05,452 --> 00:54:06,578
slizzards.

931
00:54:06,653 --> 00:54:08,848
-- Whoa. -- Stay away from those.

932
00:54:08,922 --> 00:54:11,254
And so I started to think,

933
00:54:11,324 --> 00:54:15,021
"lf only I could make them all a wee bit bigger,"

934
00:54:15,095 --> 00:54:18,087
You know for kids with meatier hands.

935
00:54:20,667 --> 00:54:22,965
That's where things went very wrong.

936
00:54:23,036 --> 00:54:24,697
I applied a growth serum,

937
00:54:24,771 --> 00:54:27,137
and they took to it all too well.

938
00:54:27,207 --> 00:54:29,607
Oh! Oh! Aah!

939
00:54:29,676 --> 00:54:30,608
Whoa!

940
00:54:33,179 --> 00:54:35,306
Oh!

941
00:54:35,382 --> 00:54:36,747
N-N-No!

942
00:54:36,816 --> 00:54:39,444
Aah! Aah! No!

943
00:54:39,519 --> 00:54:42,249
And I've been locked up in here ever since.

944
00:54:43,990 --> 00:54:45,958
I'm afraid to go out there again.

945
00:54:48,828 --> 00:54:52,594
They've tried to gobble me up on more than one occasion.

946
00:54:52,666 --> 00:54:55,760
Why do they despise me so?

947
00:54:55,835 --> 00:54:58,235
I created them.

948
00:55:01,107 --> 00:55:03,041
Do you think...

949
00:55:03,109 --> 00:55:05,339
God stays in Heaven

950
00:55:05,412 --> 00:55:07,937
because he too, lives in fear

951
00:55:08,014 --> 00:55:09,845
of what he's created...

952
00:55:09,916 --> 00:55:11,941
here on Earth?

953
00:55:12,018 --> 00:55:15,249
Stop looking at me like that.

954
00:55:15,322 --> 00:55:16,653
I'm no loon.

955
00:55:16,723 --> 00:55:18,020
What I'm still trying to figure out

956
00:55:18,091 --> 00:55:19,888
is why this island doesn't show up

957
00:55:19,960 --> 00:55:21,951
on even our most advanced satellites.

958
00:55:22,028 --> 00:55:25,156
I created a cloaking device to shield my island from curious eyes.

959
00:55:25,231 --> 00:55:28,098
Anything electronically powered that comes within a mile radius

960
00:55:28,168 --> 00:55:29,430
instantly shuts down.

961
00:55:29,502 --> 00:55:32,096
Any radar that passes over me is displaced,

962
00:55:32,172 --> 00:55:35,198
creating the illusion that my island doesn't exist.

963
00:55:35,275 --> 00:55:37,140
The Transmooker device.

964
00:55:37,210 --> 00:55:38,939
How did you know?

965
00:55:39,012 --> 00:55:40,980
Your cloaking device is highly coveted.

966
00:55:41,047 --> 00:55:43,379
People everywhere are trying to get their hands on it.

967
00:55:47,287 --> 00:55:51,348
Are you sure we're the only humans here?

968
00:55:56,262 --> 00:55:57,627
There they are --

969
00:55:57,697 --> 00:56:00,222
two children, judging by their size.

970
00:56:00,300 --> 00:56:01,665
What is this?

971
00:56:01,735 --> 00:56:04,295
It's a miniature of the island.

972
00:56:07,540 --> 00:56:10,134
The center point of the volcano provides a gravitational basis

973
00:56:10,210 --> 00:56:12,872
for which my miniature creatures

974
00:56:12,946 --> 00:56:15,414
can line up exactly to their larger clone counterparts.

975
00:56:15,482 --> 00:56:18,474
So wherever your miniature creatures are on this model,

976
00:56:18,551 --> 00:56:20,519
it's where the bigger ones are outside?

977
00:56:20,587 --> 00:56:23,613
Correct. I can keep track of their whereabouts this way.

978
00:56:23,690 --> 00:56:25,555
See?

979
00:56:25,625 --> 00:56:28,219
The two intruder children are being chased by a slizzard.

980
00:56:28,294 --> 00:56:29,591
-- Gary and Gerti. -- Leave 'em.

981
00:56:29,662 --> 00:56:31,357
We have to go help them!

982
00:56:31,431 --> 00:56:33,831
They shouldn't be snooping around my island to begin with!

983
00:56:33,900 --> 00:56:36,164
-- I'm with you dude. -- We have to help them.

984
00:56:36,236 --> 00:56:38,204
I'm not going out there! I'll be eaten!

985
00:56:41,274 --> 00:56:44,903
What a bizarre man.

986
00:56:45,045 --> 00:56:47,070
-- Help us! -- Help! -- Help us! -- Help!

987
00:56:47,147 --> 00:56:48,444
Somebody!

988
00:56:48,515 --> 00:56:49,709
What are you guys doing down there?!

989
00:56:49,783 --> 00:56:51,011
That's real funny clown. Get us out!

990
00:56:51,084 --> 00:56:53,518
We tried to activate our micrograpplers,

991
00:56:53,586 --> 00:56:55,053
but they didn't deploy!

992
00:56:55,121 --> 00:56:56,713
Nothing works here.

993
00:56:56,790 --> 00:56:59,520
Yeah we know that now. Thanks for the update, carrot top.

994
00:56:59,592 --> 00:57:02,220
-- Juni come back. They need our help. -- Oh I'll help them.

995
00:57:02,295 --> 00:57:04,627
I want to get him back over here

996
00:57:04,697 --> 00:57:07,359
so I can push him back over myself.

997
00:57:07,434 --> 00:57:08,731
-- Hurry up. -- Come on.

998
00:57:08,802 --> 00:57:10,394
Here Gary.

999
00:57:10,470 --> 00:57:11,960
Gimme your hand.

1000
00:57:13,506 --> 00:57:15,030
Thank you Carmen.

1001
00:57:19,479 --> 00:57:20,707
Here Gerti...

1002
00:57:20,780 --> 00:57:22,714
gimme your hand.

1003
00:57:22,782 --> 00:57:24,545
Just wait till my father gets here.

1004
00:57:24,617 --> 00:57:27,279
Your father's coming?

1005
00:57:30,990 --> 00:57:33,458
Where are you taking me now Carmen?

1006
00:57:33,526 --> 00:57:34,925
Hold on.

1007
00:57:39,599 --> 00:57:42,466
Why are you still hiding? We're kids not monsters.

1008
00:57:42,535 --> 00:57:43,433
What's the difference?

1009
00:57:43,503 --> 00:57:46,165
Relax. They're O.S.S. agents as well.

1010
00:57:46,239 --> 00:57:48,230
-- Level one. -- They're Donnagon's kids.

1011
00:57:48,308 --> 00:57:49,832
Agent Donnagon?

1012
00:57:49,909 --> 00:57:51,342
You work for the O.S.S., don't you?

1013
00:57:51,411 --> 00:57:53,140
I work for a man named Donnagon.

1014
00:57:53,213 --> 00:57:54,271
Who is this guy?

1015
00:57:54,347 --> 00:57:57,316
-- Donnagon's not interested in your creatures. -- Why not?

1016
00:57:57,383 --> 00:57:59,112
The Transmooker device that hides your island --

1017
00:57:59,185 --> 00:58:00,447
that's what Donnagon really wants.

1018
00:58:00,520 --> 00:58:02,613
That's not nearly as interesting.

1019
00:58:02,689 --> 00:58:04,520
Now that Donnagon's head of the O.S.S.,

1020
00:58:04,591 --> 00:58:06,616
he has the power to take it from you.

1021
00:58:06,693 --> 00:58:08,320
What are you babbling about now Juni?

1022
00:58:08,394 --> 00:58:09,759
The Transmooker you took

1023
00:58:09,829 --> 00:58:11,763
from the president's daughter Gary.

1024
00:58:11,831 --> 00:58:13,196
It was just a prototype.

1025
00:58:13,266 --> 00:58:15,359
The real Transmooker device is here on this island.

1026
00:58:15,435 --> 00:58:16,834
It's even more powerful

1027
00:58:16,903 --> 00:58:18,632
and can shut down all technology on the planet.

1028
00:58:18,705 --> 00:58:20,297
You said your father's on his way.

1029
00:58:20,373 --> 00:58:22,136
I think he's coming to pick it up.

1030
00:58:22,208 --> 00:58:23,641
You're all liars.

1031
00:58:23,710 --> 00:58:26,270
Do you really think you're gonna turn us on our own father?

1032
00:58:26,346 --> 00:58:28,314
Did your dad tell you the mission you went on

1033
00:58:28,381 --> 00:58:30,611
was just a setup for Carmen and me?

1034
00:58:30,683 --> 00:58:32,116
-- Why not? -- He has his reasons.

1035
00:58:32,185 --> 00:58:34,619
That's what being a good spy is all about --

1036
00:58:34,687 --> 00:58:36,518
trust no one.

1037
00:58:36,589 --> 00:58:38,887
How to Be a Spy.-- we've read it.

1038
00:58:38,958 --> 00:58:40,448
Well read it again.

1039
00:58:40,527 --> 00:58:43,121
A good spy makes no binding connections with family or friends.

1040
00:58:43,196 --> 00:58:45,187
Well I don't believe in that -- do you?

1041
00:58:45,265 --> 00:58:47,733
If you want to be a good spy, you better believe it.

1042
00:58:47,800 --> 00:58:50,860
My father's a great spy, so let's grow up shall we?

1043
00:58:50,937 --> 00:58:52,529
Whatever my father's done,

1044
00:58:52,605 --> 00:58:54,368
it's what it takes to play in the big world...

1045
00:58:54,440 --> 00:58:56,567
Iike it or not.

1046
00:58:56,643 --> 00:58:57,871
Come on Gerti. Let's go.

1047
00:58:59,279 --> 00:59:00,837
He's right.

1048
00:59:00,914 --> 00:59:03,678
Oh! Why can't you side with me just once?

1049
00:59:03,750 --> 00:59:05,945
There are no sides -- you're right, and he's right too.

1050
00:59:06,019 --> 00:59:08,146
That's what being a spy means.

1051
00:59:08,221 --> 00:59:09,552
Well I don't like it.

1052
00:59:09,622 --> 00:59:11,055
-- Then quit. -- I will.

1053
00:59:11,124 --> 00:59:12,216
Yeah right.

1054
00:59:30,843 --> 00:59:32,538
Donnagon was right --

1055
00:59:32,612 --> 00:59:35,581
Their DragonSpy doesn't show up anywhere on radar.

1056
00:59:35,648 --> 00:59:38,947
I am not interested in finding the sub.

1057
00:59:41,020 --> 00:59:42,544
Remember that year

1058
00:59:42,622 --> 00:59:45,785
I insisted on doing the children's dental work...myself?

1059
00:59:45,858 --> 00:59:47,689
How could I forget?

1060
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:49,660
Well...

1061
00:59:49,729 --> 00:59:52,493
I installed a nonelectrical tracking device

1062
00:59:52,565 --> 00:59:53,691
in their teeth --

1063
00:59:53,766 --> 00:59:55,427
my own invention.

1064
00:59:55,501 --> 00:59:58,095
But I haven't been able to test it,

1065
00:59:58,171 --> 00:59:59,968
until...

1066
01:00:00,039 --> 01:00:01,370
now.

1067
01:00:03,376 --> 01:00:05,105
-- Honey it works! -- Whoa...

1068
01:00:05,178 --> 01:00:07,908
Hard to believe.

1069
01:00:07,981 --> 01:00:09,448
But according to this...

1070
01:00:10,883 --> 01:00:13,909
They're in the middle of the ocean.

1071
01:00:13,987 --> 01:00:15,215
Above sea level.

1072
01:00:15,288 --> 01:00:18,815
But where they are on the map, there's no land mass.

1073
01:00:18,891 --> 01:00:21,382
How can that be?

1074
01:00:23,563 --> 01:00:24,587
Now what?

1075
01:00:26,699 --> 01:00:28,564
Something's got us.

1076
01:00:50,690 --> 01:00:52,749
-- Aaah! -- What is it?!

1077
01:00:52,825 --> 01:00:54,952
Your mother.

1078
01:00:55,028 --> 01:00:57,656
-- Mom? -- We wanted to join you.

1079
01:00:57,730 --> 01:00:59,197
Are you nuts?

1080
01:00:59,265 --> 01:01:01,028
We needed a bigger boat.

1081
01:01:01,100 --> 01:01:02,897
And we brought real food --

1082
01:01:02,969 --> 01:01:06,837
none of that freeze-dried stuff you think's so chic.

1083
01:01:06,906 --> 01:01:08,771
-- Son-in-law. -- Yeah?

1084
01:01:08,841 --> 01:01:10,365
Make yourself useful.

1085
01:01:10,443 --> 01:01:11,876
Why are you here?

1086
01:01:11,944 --> 01:01:14,606
We wanted to help get our grandchildren back!

1087
01:01:14,681 --> 01:01:15,648
Ah-ah!

1088
01:01:16,949 --> 01:01:19,281
We will get our grandchildren back.

1089
01:01:19,352 --> 01:01:20,979
Gracias. #Oh wait.

1090
01:01:21,054 --> 01:01:23,147
-- You've got something on your lip. -- What?

1091
01:01:23,222 --> 01:01:25,213
-- Ugh! -- Got it.

1092
01:01:25,291 --> 01:01:27,191
Uh Mom...

1093
01:01:27,260 --> 01:01:30,957
Dad I am a big girl now, and I can take care of myself okay?

1094
01:01:31,030 --> 01:01:33,498
And Gregorio and l, we can take care of finding our children.

1095
01:01:33,566 --> 01:01:35,830
No you don't seem to understand.

1096
01:01:35,902 --> 01:01:39,804
This isn't you and Gregorio simply saving the world again.

1097
01:01:39,872 --> 01:01:43,535
This time we all have much more to lose if you fail --

1098
01:01:43,609 --> 01:01:45,406
Carmen and Juni.

1099
01:01:45,478 --> 01:01:47,412
You cannot come with us.

1100
01:01:47,480 --> 01:01:49,141
It is too dangerous.

1101
01:01:49,215 --> 01:01:53,208
Oh you mean uh, we can't handle ourselves huh?

1102
01:02:03,029 --> 01:02:05,463
May I have my moustache back...

1103
01:02:05,531 --> 01:02:07,226
please?

1104
01:02:08,502 --> 01:02:10,993
If Donnagon really is on his way...

1105
01:02:12,739 --> 01:02:16,402
...we have to destroy the Transmooker.

1106
01:02:16,476 --> 01:02:17,966
Where is it?

1107
01:02:18,044 --> 01:02:21,445
The other side of the island. Not easy to get to.

1108
01:02:21,515 --> 01:02:23,176
The journey alone

1109
01:02:23,250 --> 01:02:25,810
is more dangerous than the Transmooker itself.

1110
01:02:25,886 --> 01:02:27,581
I made sure of it.

1111
01:02:27,654 --> 01:02:29,246
Show us.

1112
01:02:29,322 --> 01:02:31,847
You're not going out there, are you?

1113
01:02:31,925 --> 01:02:34,257
We don't have much choice, do we?

1114
01:02:34,327 --> 01:02:35,760
With those monsters running around?

1115
01:02:35,829 --> 01:02:37,558
I don't believe they're monsters.

1116
01:02:37,631 --> 01:02:39,155
Maybe you shouldn't either.

1117
01:02:39,232 --> 01:02:41,393
-- Well what should I believe? -- I don't know.

1118
01:02:41,468 --> 01:02:42,992
You're always in here hiding.

1119
01:02:43,069 --> 01:02:45,003
Maybe they just wanna be with you.

1120
01:02:45,071 --> 01:02:46,265
Be#with me?

1121
01:02:46,339 --> 01:02:48,307
They wanna be picking me out of their teeth,

1122
01:02:48,375 --> 01:02:49,569
is what they wanna be.

1123
01:02:49,643 --> 01:02:51,770
You just gotta show them who's boss.

1124
01:02:51,845 --> 01:02:52,971
You're not afraid?

1125
01:02:54,681 --> 01:02:57,673
First thing you gotta do is...

1126
01:02:59,286 --> 01:03:01,618
...fall into this pit.

1127
01:03:04,558 --> 01:03:06,389
How does it work?

1128
01:03:06,459 --> 01:03:08,859
Supposedly, they're run magnetically.

1129
01:03:10,864 --> 01:03:13,492
We should be able to ride over a determined path.

1130
01:03:23,476 --> 01:03:26,570
We have to get the Transmooker before they do.

1131
01:03:26,646 --> 01:03:28,238
Right.

1132
01:03:36,723 --> 01:03:38,315
Slizzards.

1133
01:03:38,391 --> 01:03:40,382
Oh no.

1134
01:03:49,536 --> 01:03:50,935
This is cool.

1135
01:03:53,707 --> 01:03:55,607
Ee! Ee! Ee!

1136
01:03:55,675 --> 01:03:57,768
Ooh! Uh!

1137
01:03:57,844 --> 01:03:58,776
Juni!

1138
01:03:58,845 --> 01:04:00,506
Juni!

1139
01:04:00,580 --> 01:04:03,014
I think we should get off now.

1140
01:04:03,083 --> 01:04:04,141
Why?

1141
01:04:04,217 --> 01:04:05,445
Trust me!

1142
01:04:06,386 --> 01:04:08,115
Aaah!

1143
01:04:08,188 --> 01:04:10,053
Jump now!

1144
01:04:18,898 --> 01:04:20,763
Gary and Gerti.

1145
01:04:20,834 --> 01:04:24,133
I told you they were following us.

1146
01:04:24,204 --> 01:04:25,136
Uh.

1147
01:04:30,877 --> 01:04:33,072
You have one new message.

1148
01:04:33,146 --> 01:04:34,374
Message one...

1149
01:04:34,447 --> 01:04:36,506
Hello Alexandra, it's me --

1150
01:04:36,583 --> 01:04:38,073
agent Juni Cortez.

1151
01:04:38,151 --> 01:04:39,675
I'm on a mission...

1152
01:04:39,753 --> 01:04:41,516
I know I shouldn't be.

1153
01:04:41,588 --> 01:04:44,421
But I had an idea for you and your father.

1154
01:04:44,491 --> 01:04:46,425
Simply tell him you need to talk to him.

1155
01:04:46,493 --> 01:04:48,927
Tell him it's nothing urgent,

1156
01:04:48,995 --> 01:04:51,327
but someday it might be urgent.

1157
01:04:51,398 --> 01:04:54,890
And you need to open the communication lines right now.

1158
01:04:54,968 --> 01:04:57,368
So give me a call. Love to hear from you.

1159
01:04:57,437 --> 01:04:58,870
And right now it's about --

1160
01:04:58,938 --> 01:05:01,600
Silly me I forgot my watch doesn't tell time.

1161
01:05:01,675 --> 01:05:02,642
Heh. And uh --

1162
01:05:04,077 --> 01:05:05,840
Carmen: Something's wrong. Take the wheel.

1163
01:05:05,912 --> 01:05:07,846
Gotta go. Good luck!

1164
01:05:07,914 --> 01:05:09,848
-- Juni! -- Computer: End of message.

1165
01:05:15,455 --> 01:05:19,186
-- Gregorio the signal requires that you go around it. -- He won't listen to you.

1166
01:05:19,259 --> 01:05:22,194
-- He won't listen to you, Mother. -- Choose another directi--

1167
01:05:22,262 --> 01:05:25,720
He wants to make sure he loses the children again.

1168
01:05:25,799 --> 01:05:28,233
If you would only listen to us and do what we're saying --

1169
01:05:28,301 --> 01:05:30,030
you're tracking them all wrong.

1170
01:05:30,103 --> 01:05:32,469
Ingrid tell him he's tracking them all wrong.

1171
01:05:32,539 --> 01:05:34,370
Mom Dad, I have told you before,

1172
01:05:34,441 --> 01:05:36,932
and I will tell you again -- no backseat driving.

1173
01:05:37,010 --> 01:05:40,707
-- Thank you. -- When Gregorio is at the wheel, no one tells him what to do.

1174
01:05:42,449 --> 01:05:44,212
Turn here honey.

1175
01:05:45,452 --> 01:05:46,384
Sorry.

1176
01:05:46,453 --> 01:05:47,943
Okay.

1177
01:05:48,021 --> 01:05:51,957
You're sure you're reading that map correctly?

1178
01:05:52,025 --> 01:05:54,016
The coordinates correspond

1179
01:05:54,094 --> 01:05:57,154
to Carmen and Juni's current position.

1180
01:05:57,230 --> 01:05:58,959
These are my children.

1181
01:05:59,032 --> 01:06:01,227
And I will find them my way!!

1182
01:06:03,036 --> 01:06:04,230
Blah blah blah.

1183
01:06:04,304 --> 01:06:06,795
I never understand a single word he's saying.

1184
01:06:06,873 --> 01:06:08,101
Never.

1185
01:06:08,174 --> 01:06:09,732
Not only were we set up,

1186
01:06:09,809 --> 01:06:12,141
but I bet Donnagon knew all along

1187
01:06:12,212 --> 01:06:15,648
that you'd hack your way into taking this assignment.

1188
01:06:15,715 --> 01:06:18,741
I was wondering the same thing.

1189
01:06:20,587 --> 01:06:21,815
Juni open up.

1190
01:06:21,888 --> 01:06:23,480
What?

1191
01:06:23,556 --> 01:06:27,219
-- Aah. Aah. -- Dad installed these trackers in case we ever got lost.

1192
01:06:27,293 --> 01:06:29,158
-- Ah. Ah-ha. Aah. -- Ah.

1193
01:06:29,229 --> 01:06:30,355
-- Ow! -- Ugh!

1194
01:06:30,430 --> 01:06:31,954
Ah.

1195
01:06:32,031 --> 01:06:33,020
Ow.

1196
01:06:33,099 --> 01:06:36,364
Hurry. Take mine out.

1197
01:06:36,436 --> 01:06:39,132
And why are we doing this?

1198
01:06:39,205 --> 01:06:40,229
Ah! Ah!

1199
01:06:40,306 --> 01:06:41,830
-- Ah! -- Ugh!

1200
01:06:41,908 --> 01:06:43,341
Aah.

1201
01:06:43,409 --> 01:06:45,468
When we get lost, who saves us?

1202
01:06:45,545 --> 01:06:47,308
Mom and Dad.

1203
01:06:47,380 --> 01:06:49,109
Now if Mom and Dad also disappear,

1204
01:06:49,182 --> 01:06:51,912
who's gonna stop Donnagon from using the Transmooker device?

1205
01:06:51,985 --> 01:06:53,509
Donnagon wants us all together

1206
01:06:53,586 --> 01:06:55,952
so he can destroy the island and all of us with it.

1207
01:06:56,022 --> 01:06:58,855
Mom and Dad -- even Romero.

1208
01:06:58,925 --> 01:07:01,826
We can't let Mom and Dad find us...

1209
01:07:01,895 --> 01:07:04,056
or Donnagon wins.

1210
01:07:04,130 --> 01:07:06,997
A big sacrifice.

1211
01:07:07,066 --> 01:07:08,658
Family is sacrifice.

1212
01:07:13,606 --> 01:07:14,971
What happened?

1213
01:07:15,041 --> 01:07:17,066
What did -- what did you just do?

1214
01:07:20,947 --> 01:07:22,380
We lost Carmen.

1215
01:07:24,350 --> 01:07:26,875
A-And Juni?

1216
01:07:26,953 --> 01:07:28,250
Juni's still on-line.

1217
01:07:31,124 --> 01:07:33,251
I love you.

1218
01:07:37,430 --> 01:07:39,660
That can't be.

1219
01:07:41,534 --> 01:07:45,334
Okay okay. What do we do?

1220
01:07:49,776 --> 01:07:51,437
I don't know.

1221
01:08:01,688 --> 01:08:03,019
Maybe this is like

1222
01:08:03,089 --> 01:08:05,614
the mission of the spies who didn't want to be found.

1223
01:08:06,860 --> 01:08:08,122
You know...

1224
01:08:08,194 --> 01:08:10,856
if they don't want to be found,

1225
01:08:10,930 --> 01:08:13,922
maybe their position is compromised.

1226
01:08:21,708 --> 01:08:26,839
Now Gregorio don't tell me you didn't have a backup plan.

1227
01:08:28,047 --> 01:08:31,813
Ingrid was Juni wearing that charm necklace

1228
01:08:31,885 --> 01:08:34,786
I sent him for Christmas last year?

1229
01:08:34,854 --> 01:08:36,719
He never takes it off.

1230
01:08:36,789 --> 01:08:37,915
Then we got him.

1231
01:08:37,991 --> 01:08:42,485
I was worried about Juni's well-being,

1232
01:08:42,562 --> 01:08:48,467
so I put a tracer in his necklace.

1233
01:08:49,669 --> 01:08:51,227
There he is.

1234
01:08:51,304 --> 01:08:52,737
Thanks Dad.

1235
01:08:52,805 --> 01:08:55,638
Are you sure you don't want me to take over the wheel?

1236
01:08:55,708 --> 01:08:56,868
I -- that's funny.

1237
01:08:56,943 --> 01:08:59,434
It's funny.

1238
01:09:07,153 --> 01:09:08,950
Back to work.

1239
01:09:09,022 --> 01:09:10,785
Where are we?

1240
01:09:10,857 --> 01:09:12,051
Well...

1241
01:09:12,125 --> 01:09:15,959
not far from the antechamber.

1242
01:09:16,029 --> 01:09:18,520
I think it's behind us.

1243
01:09:26,205 --> 01:09:27,263
Don't move.

1244
01:09:27,340 --> 01:09:29,171
Maybe it's friendly.

1245
01:09:31,210 --> 01:09:33,303
Maybe it's not.

1246
01:09:34,847 --> 01:09:37,042
Let's go!

1247
01:09:46,693 --> 01:09:48,524
Uh!

1248
01:09:48,594 --> 01:09:49,788
-- Uh! -- Uh!

1249
01:09:49,862 --> 01:09:51,193
Uh.

1250
01:09:53,099 --> 01:09:54,794
It's an underwater cave.

1251
01:09:54,867 --> 01:09:57,199
We'll have to go all the way around.

1252
01:09:57,270 --> 01:09:59,135
That'll take all day.

1253
01:09:59,205 --> 01:10:00,968
There must be a faster --

1254
01:10:15,655 --> 01:10:17,646
Wow...

1255
01:10:17,723 --> 01:10:20,487
What is this place?

1256
01:10:23,496 --> 01:10:26,522
Do you think that's real gold?

1257
01:10:26,599 --> 01:10:28,726
Gross!

1258
01:10:28,801 --> 01:10:31,326
This is so slimy.

1259
01:10:31,404 --> 01:10:33,372
I hate mold.

1260
01:10:33,439 --> 01:10:35,373
I can hear your thoughts.

1261
01:10:35,441 --> 01:10:36,931
What?

1262
01:10:37,009 --> 01:10:38,874
And you can hear mine!

1263
01:10:38,944 --> 01:10:40,536
Our mouths aren't moving,

1264
01:10:40,613 --> 01:10:43,013
but we can hear what we're thinking.

1265
01:10:43,082 --> 01:10:44,572
Say something.

1266
01:10:46,986 --> 01:10:49,784
How strange.

1267
01:10:49,855 --> 01:10:52,688
We can only communicate by thought.

1268
01:10:52,758 --> 01:10:54,248
-- Magic. -- Hmm.

1269
01:10:54,326 --> 01:10:55,850
Think something.

1270
01:10:55,928 --> 01:10:58,294
Um...your feet stink.

1271
01:10:59,865 --> 01:11:02,129
I wonder.

1272
01:11:04,670 --> 01:11:06,262
Ohhh!

1273
01:11:06,338 --> 01:11:08,238
Oh! Oh!

1274
01:11:08,307 --> 01:11:12,038
Okay this place is really weird.

1275
01:11:12,111 --> 01:11:13,203
Let's go.

1276
01:11:13,279 --> 01:11:14,746
Good thinking.

1277
01:11:19,652 --> 01:11:23,144
Now this is more like it.

1278
01:11:23,222 --> 01:11:26,623
Treasure.

1279
01:11:29,929 --> 01:11:31,954
Skeletons.

1280
01:11:32,031 --> 01:11:34,431
Dead skeletons.

1281
01:11:34,500 --> 01:11:36,900
Is there any other kind?

1282
01:11:42,675 --> 01:11:46,839
This must've been where the pirate prisoners and treasure were kept.

1283
01:11:56,689 --> 01:11:59,852
This must've been a pretty special necklace

1284
01:11:59,925 --> 01:12:02,189
for them to die fighting over it.

1285
01:12:02,261 --> 01:12:04,491
One necklace to rule them all --

1286
01:12:04,563 --> 01:12:05,757
Put it back Juni!

1287
01:12:05,831 --> 01:12:07,230
I didn't take it yet.

1288
01:12:07,299 --> 01:12:09,460
I can read your mind, remember?

1289
01:12:09,535 --> 01:12:11,765
This land is ancient and cursed.

1290
01:12:11,837 --> 01:12:14,305
If you take anything, you'll doom us both.

1291
01:12:14,373 --> 01:12:16,273
Let's go!

1292
01:12:44,270 --> 01:12:47,034
Come on! I think I found a way out.

1293
01:12:47,106 --> 01:12:48,437
Which way?

1294
01:12:48,507 --> 01:12:51,374
I don't know you pick -- right or left?

1295
01:12:51,443 --> 01:12:53,707
Right.

1296
01:12:58,117 --> 01:13:00,108
Wait a minute.

1297
01:13:00,186 --> 01:13:01,210
Oh no!

1298
01:13:01,287 --> 01:13:03,812
We went in a circle.

1299
01:13:03,889 --> 01:13:04,856
What?

1300
01:13:04,924 --> 01:13:05,891
Come on.

1301
01:13:05,958 --> 01:13:07,858
Let's try it again.

1302
01:13:09,995 --> 01:13:13,089
Come on Juni! I know what we did wrong.

1303
01:13:13,165 --> 01:13:16,225
We've gotta go left.

1304
01:13:18,571 --> 01:13:20,664
Maybe I should put this back.

1305
01:13:20,739 --> 01:13:21,706
Uh-oh.

1306
01:13:21,774 --> 01:13:24,038
Where are the dead skeletons?

1307
01:13:30,583 --> 01:13:32,608
Aaaah!

1308
01:13:32,685 --> 01:13:34,778
Carmen!

1309
01:13:43,529 --> 01:13:45,360
Juni!!

1310
01:13:46,799 --> 01:13:49,290
Ugh!

1311
01:13:50,703 --> 01:13:52,637
Help me!!

1312
01:13:52,705 --> 01:13:53,831
Huh?

1313
01:13:53,906 --> 01:13:54,998
Ugh!

1314
01:13:55,074 --> 01:13:56,200
Ugh!

1315
01:13:56,275 --> 01:13:57,367
Ugh!

1316
01:13:59,344 --> 01:14:01,539
Ugh!

1317
01:14:01,613 --> 01:14:03,240
Hey bonehead!

1318
01:14:03,315 --> 01:14:04,247
Ugh!

1319
01:14:04,316 --> 01:14:05,647
Ooh. Ooh.

1320
01:14:05,718 --> 01:14:06,707
Whah!

1321
01:14:06,785 --> 01:14:08,912
Ugh! Ooh!

1322
01:14:08,987 --> 01:14:11,285
Ugh! Ugh!

1323
01:14:11,356 --> 01:14:13,790
Oh no.

1324
01:14:17,229 --> 01:14:18,787
Ugh!

1325
01:14:18,864 --> 01:14:20,422
Ugh!

1326
01:14:20,499 --> 01:14:22,091
Why is this happening?!

1327
01:14:22,167 --> 01:14:23,225
I don't know!

1328
01:14:23,302 --> 01:14:24,963
Ugh! Uh!

1329
01:14:25,971 --> 01:14:27,199
Uh!

1330
01:14:27,272 --> 01:14:29,502
Ugh! Uh! Ugh!

1331
01:14:29,575 --> 01:14:30,564
Wait a minute!

1332
01:14:30,642 --> 01:14:32,837
You took something, didn't you?!

1333
01:14:32,911 --> 01:14:34,572
No! Y-Y-You told me not to!

1334
01:14:36,181 --> 01:14:37,307
Why would l?

1335
01:14:38,751 --> 01:14:40,241
Oh!

1336
01:14:40,319 --> 01:14:42,753
Juni!

1337
01:14:42,821 --> 01:14:43,981
Carmen!!

1338
01:14:46,992 --> 01:14:48,016
Ugh!

1339
01:14:48,093 --> 01:14:49,082
Ah! Ooh!

1340
01:14:52,231 --> 01:14:53,027
Wait.

1341
01:14:53,098 --> 01:14:55,032
Ah.

1342
01:14:58,704 --> 01:15:00,035
I'm sorry.

1343
01:15:09,348 --> 01:15:10,838
Carmen!

1344
01:15:10,916 --> 01:15:13,441
Carmen!

1345
01:15:17,456 --> 01:15:18,980
Uh! Ahh! Uh! Ahh!

1346
01:15:20,759 --> 01:15:22,522
You too huh?

1347
01:15:22,594 --> 01:15:24,152
Yeah.

1348
01:15:25,363 --> 01:15:26,523
Where's your brother?

1349
01:15:27,766 --> 01:15:28,630
Did he get eaten?

1350
01:15:28,700 --> 01:15:32,693
No. He's out there looking for Juni.

1351
01:15:32,771 --> 01:15:35,205
You know he squashed Juni's bug on purpose.

1352
01:15:35,273 --> 01:15:37,332
Yeah I know.

1353
01:15:37,409 --> 01:15:39,377
Now he wants to squash Juni.

1354
01:15:39,444 --> 01:15:41,139
Don't you think we should get out of here?

1355
01:15:44,950 --> 01:15:45,939
Oh.

1356
01:15:46,017 --> 01:15:47,041
Mm-hmm.

1357
01:15:48,386 --> 01:15:52,880
Carmen!

1358
01:15:52,958 --> 01:15:54,619
I'm dreaming.

1359
01:15:54,693 --> 01:15:57,321
I am totally dreaming.

1360
01:15:59,531 --> 01:16:02,261
And I'm hungry too.

1361
01:16:06,071 --> 01:16:08,403
Oh. Oh. Oh.

1362
01:16:15,580 --> 01:16:18,208
You like honey-roasted ham and potatoes don't you?

1363
01:16:18,283 --> 01:16:20,615
That's what flavor this is.

1364
01:16:20,685 --> 01:16:22,778
Highly nutritious.

1365
01:16:22,854 --> 01:16:26,449
Packed with protein and essential carbs.

1366
01:16:27,259 --> 01:16:28,226
Hyah!

1367
01:16:30,428 --> 01:16:32,555
Everything a growing centaur needs.

1368
01:16:34,132 --> 01:16:35,258
You're welcome.

1369
01:16:40,105 --> 01:16:42,869
Ooooohhhh!

1370
01:16:44,309 --> 01:16:47,676
Well well well. Your friend likes freeze-dried.

1371
01:16:47,746 --> 01:16:49,008
So does mine.

1372
01:16:56,354 --> 01:16:58,379
Uh!

1373
01:16:59,391 --> 01:17:01,951
All right buddy. Let's kick their butts.

1374
01:17:03,628 --> 01:17:05,653
Heh heh heh. We're waiting.

1375
01:17:05,730 --> 01:17:07,220
Come on.

1376
01:17:07,299 --> 01:17:10,097
Can't let you bust up my dad's machine Juni.

1377
01:17:10,168 --> 01:17:12,636
Whoa!

1378
01:17:13,838 --> 01:17:16,238
So I guess I'll just have to bust you up.

1379
01:17:16,308 --> 01:17:17,536
We can take 'em.

1380
01:17:17,609 --> 01:17:19,543
Come on buddy. We can take 'em.

1381
01:17:19,611 --> 01:17:23,638
I don't think we can take 'em!

1382
01:17:28,486 --> 01:17:30,215
Must try and help them.

1383
01:17:31,389 --> 01:17:32,856
Must.

1384
01:17:32,924 --> 01:17:35,484
So even if your dad is behind all this,

1385
01:17:35,560 --> 01:17:38,324
you'd still side with him over what's right?

1386
01:17:38,396 --> 01:17:41,194
Right? How do you ever know what's right?

1387
01:17:41,266 --> 01:17:42,358
Trust me,

1388
01:17:42,434 --> 01:17:45,494
when the moment comes, you'll know.

1389
01:17:49,908 --> 01:17:51,876
I think that moment's come.

1390
01:17:53,511 --> 01:17:55,274
Uh!

1391
01:17:56,615 --> 01:17:57,843
-- Aah! -- Aah!

1392
01:17:57,916 --> 01:17:59,383
Uh!

1393
01:18:01,987 --> 01:18:03,750
Come on!

1394
01:18:03,822 --> 01:18:06,791
Show 'em who's boss.

1395
01:18:06,858 --> 01:18:09,452
Show 'em who's boss.

1396
01:18:09,527 --> 01:18:11,017
I'm the boss.

1397
01:18:16,167 --> 01:18:17,566
I'm the --

1398
01:18:20,271 --> 01:18:21,465
Oh!

1399
01:18:25,610 --> 01:18:27,407
Whoa!

1400
01:18:27,479 --> 01:18:28,912
Whoa!

1401
01:18:28,980 --> 01:18:30,072
Whoa!

1402
01:18:30,949 --> 01:18:32,416
Whoa! Whoa!

1403
01:18:32,484 --> 01:18:34,315
Look out!

1404
01:18:34,386 --> 01:18:35,410
Aah!

1405
01:18:37,222 --> 01:18:39,190
Forward go man.

1406
01:18:42,060 --> 01:18:43,755
-- Aaahhh! -- Uhh!

1407
01:18:47,666 --> 01:18:49,998
Come on spidey. You can do it.

1408
01:18:50,068 --> 01:18:52,036
Yeah!

1409
01:18:55,073 --> 01:18:56,734
Ohh!

1410
01:18:56,808 --> 01:18:58,867
Ohh! Oh! Uh!

1411
01:18:58,943 --> 01:19:00,570
Uh! Uh!

1412
01:19:01,846 --> 01:19:03,905
Uh.

1413
01:19:05,216 --> 01:19:07,741
Your creature's lame.

1414
01:19:07,819 --> 01:19:10,151
So are you lame-o.

1415
01:19:10,221 --> 01:19:12,086
It's all over for you squirt.

1416
01:19:12,157 --> 01:19:15,718
Too bad your dork sister's not here to cheer me on.

1417
01:19:18,430 --> 01:19:20,261
-- Uh! -- Hey!

1418
01:19:21,166 --> 01:19:23,191
Uh!

1419
01:19:25,470 --> 01:19:26,937
Ya-a-a-a-a-a-h!

1420
01:19:47,659 --> 01:19:49,627
I don't want to hurt you, Carmen.

1421
01:19:49,694 --> 01:19:52,925
You're so full of shiitake mushrooms.

1422
01:19:52,997 --> 01:19:55,158
-- Ooh! -- Ooh! -- Ooh! -- Ooh!

1423
01:19:56,367 --> 01:19:57,629
Put it down Carmen.

1424
01:19:57,702 --> 01:19:59,067
Uh!

1425
01:20:00,205 --> 01:20:02,002
Put it down.

1426
01:20:02,907 --> 01:20:03,839
Uhh!

1427
01:20:07,178 --> 01:20:08,736
Ohh!

1428
01:20:08,813 --> 01:20:10,940
Okay.

1429
01:20:11,015 --> 01:20:13,813
All right.

1430
01:20:13,885 --> 01:20:15,944
Gerti, a little assistance here.

1431
01:20:16,020 --> 01:20:18,352
Don't look at me brother. You're fighting a girl.

1432
01:20:18,423 --> 01:20:19,788
You're gonna lose.

1433
01:20:21,159 --> 01:20:22,183
Aah!

1434
01:20:25,196 --> 01:20:27,255
I'm siding with you.

1435
01:20:27,332 --> 01:20:29,129
Thanks.

1436
01:20:29,200 --> 01:20:31,464
But just this once.

1437
01:20:36,608 --> 01:20:37,666
Cortezes.

1438
01:20:37,742 --> 01:20:39,801
Uh!

1439
01:20:46,184 --> 01:20:48,482
You gonna help me or not?

1440
01:21:11,475 --> 01:21:13,909
Well there it is.

1441
01:21:13,978 --> 01:21:16,173
How do you know?

1442
01:21:16,247 --> 01:21:19,808
'Cause it's big and weird and in the middle of the room.

1443
01:21:19,884 --> 01:21:21,408
Good point.

1444
01:21:29,327 --> 01:21:30,385
Careful Juni!

1445
01:21:30,461 --> 01:21:31,951
If you don't shut it down right,

1446
01:21:32,029 --> 01:21:33,860
you can bring the entire world to an end.

1447
01:21:33,931 --> 01:21:34,955
Thanks.

1448
01:21:35,032 --> 01:21:36,192
I'm serious.

1449
01:21:36,267 --> 01:21:38,201
Well we have to shut it down.

1450
01:21:39,704 --> 01:21:41,763
This turns that off.

1451
01:21:43,040 --> 01:21:45,338
And that turns this off.

1452
01:21:47,245 --> 01:21:50,305
He said there's something tricky about the third switch.

1453
01:21:53,918 --> 01:21:55,078
Let's see.

1454
01:21:56,587 --> 01:21:59,215
Too late Gary. We got here first.

1455
01:21:59,290 --> 01:22:01,224
Just stand up against the wall like a good boy

1456
01:22:01,292 --> 01:22:02,554
and leave us alone.

1457
01:22:02,627 --> 01:22:05,596
Nice try but we brought friends this time.

1458
01:22:06,697 --> 01:22:07,721
Romero.

1459
01:22:07,798 --> 01:22:09,766
What are you doing outside of your cage?

1460
01:22:09,834 --> 01:22:11,563
I have no idea.

1461
01:22:14,038 --> 01:22:15,096
Donnagon.

1462
01:22:15,172 --> 01:22:16,571
Hello agents.

1463
01:22:16,641 --> 01:22:18,131
Warming it up for me?

1464
01:22:19,443 --> 01:22:22,310
Are you ready to cooperate this time Romero?

1465
01:22:22,380 --> 01:22:23,779
-- l uh... -- Good.

1466
01:22:23,848 --> 01:22:28,251
This should be pain... and simple.

1467
01:22:29,053 --> 01:22:30,645
Oh!

1468
01:22:30,721 --> 01:22:32,245
What did you do?

1469
01:22:32,323 --> 01:22:33,881
He started the Transmooker!

1470
01:22:33,958 --> 01:22:36,586
You said three switches.

1471
01:22:36,661 --> 01:22:39,653
The entire world will shut down instantly.

1472
01:22:39,730 --> 01:22:41,163
Good going cheese ball.

1473
01:22:41,232 --> 01:22:42,494
What do we do?!

1474
01:22:42,566 --> 01:22:45,797
You must bind together the three toggle switches.

1475
01:22:49,206 --> 01:22:50,833
It won't stay up!

1476
01:22:50,908 --> 01:22:53,001
-- Machete elastic wonder! -- Machete elastic wonder!

1477
01:22:53,077 --> 01:22:54,237
Here -- grab it!

1478
01:22:54,312 --> 01:22:56,280
-- Uh! -- Oh!

1479
01:23:00,584 --> 01:23:03,018
Give it to me. Give it!

1480
01:23:03,087 --> 01:23:04,384
Dad...

1481
01:23:04,455 --> 01:23:05,615
Give it to me.

1482
01:23:06,957 --> 01:23:07,981
Give it to me...

1483
01:23:10,561 --> 01:23:12,290
...or else.

1484
01:23:12,363 --> 01:23:14,763
Give it to him Carmen.

1485
01:23:20,771 --> 01:23:21,795
Where'd it go?

1486
01:23:21,872 --> 01:23:23,271
Where'd it go?!

1487
01:23:23,341 --> 01:23:24,740
I don't know.

1488
01:23:24,809 --> 01:23:26,276
The spork took it.

1489
01:23:26,344 --> 01:23:28,972
Back to its...nest.

1490
01:23:30,181 --> 01:23:31,808
I know where the nest is Dad.

1491
01:23:33,050 --> 01:23:36,019
I also have Romero's instruction book.

1492
01:23:36,087 --> 01:23:37,213
Hey.

1493
01:23:37,288 --> 01:23:38,983
Brat.

1494
01:23:39,056 --> 01:23:40,990
Come on!

1495
01:23:55,072 --> 01:23:57,734
It's just over that big hill.

1496
01:23:57,808 --> 01:23:59,070
-- Ohh! -- Ohh!

1497
01:23:59,143 --> 01:24:02,044
Are you sure this is the right way?

1498
01:24:02,113 --> 01:24:04,581
My watch has a GPS satellite, you dope.

1499
01:24:04,648 --> 01:24:06,013
Wait a minute.

1500
01:24:06,083 --> 01:24:07,550
How can this be?

1501
01:24:07,618 --> 01:24:09,347
When you took out the Transmooker,

1502
01:24:09,420 --> 01:24:11,411
the island cloaking device was shut down.

1503
01:24:11,489 --> 01:24:13,150
Then what are we doing on foot?

1504
01:24:14,558 --> 01:24:16,685
Later Romero.

1505
01:24:17,495 --> 01:24:18,723
Whoa!

1506
01:24:18,796 --> 01:24:20,423
Aah! Uhh!

1507
01:24:30,641 --> 01:24:31,630
There it is!

1508
01:24:31,709 --> 01:24:33,336
Get up there Dad! Come on!

1509
01:24:33,411 --> 01:24:34,844
Okay Magna Men,

1510
01:24:34,912 --> 01:24:38,541
we're gonna need a human ladder starting right...here.

1511
01:24:38,616 --> 01:24:40,174
Carmen!

1512
01:24:48,526 --> 01:24:49,458
What?!

1513
01:24:49,527 --> 01:24:51,392
An agent's only as good as her gadgets.

1514
01:25:01,405 --> 01:25:02,872
They're heading for the beach.

1515
01:25:07,044 --> 01:25:09,569
Uhh!

1516
01:25:14,151 --> 01:25:15,880
Help! Uh!

1517
01:25:30,701 --> 01:25:33,135
The kid was right.

1518
01:25:53,557 --> 01:25:55,582
What are you doing?

1519
01:25:55,659 --> 01:25:57,388
Trying to remote-pilot our submarine to the surface

1520
01:25:57,461 --> 01:25:58,826
so we can get out of here.

1521
01:25:58,896 --> 01:26:01,160
. Get on your GPS and see where Mom and Dad are.

1522
01:26:04,502 --> 01:26:05,901
This can't be right.

1523
01:26:05,970 --> 01:26:08,939
This shows that they're right next to us.

1524
01:26:14,745 --> 01:26:16,110
Oh no!

1525
01:26:16,180 --> 01:26:18,307
That's no way to greet your grandparents.

1526
01:26:18,382 --> 01:26:19,644
Come on.

1527
01:26:19,717 --> 01:26:20,979
Grandpa!

1528
01:26:21,051 --> 01:26:23,576
Ah Juni.

1529
01:26:23,654 --> 01:26:25,952
Come here come here.

1530
01:26:28,158 --> 01:26:31,992
Always take this with you wherever you go,

1531
01:26:32,062 --> 01:26:34,030
and I'll always be there.

1532
01:26:34,098 --> 01:26:35,326
I promise Grandpa.

1533
01:26:37,034 --> 01:26:38,023
Not you guys!

1534
01:26:38,102 --> 01:26:39,262
Oh.

1535
01:26:39,336 --> 01:26:41,167
You don't want to be rescued.

1536
01:26:41,238 --> 01:26:43,069
You don't want to be saved.

1537
01:26:43,140 --> 01:26:44,630
That's all right.

1538
01:26:44,708 --> 01:26:46,972
We thought you might... you might need us.

1539
01:26:47,044 --> 01:26:48,705
Go talk to your father.

1540
01:26:48,779 --> 01:26:50,576
-- Dad! -- Hey Mom.

1541
01:26:50,648 --> 01:26:52,673
-- Come on Dad. Look at me. -- Two spies who didn't want to be found?

1542
01:26:52,750 --> 01:26:54,183
-- Yes. -- Yes. I like your thinking.

1543
01:26:54,251 --> 01:26:56,412
But you know what? Those spies didn't have me for a mom.

1544
01:26:56,487 --> 01:26:57,852
-- Come on. -- Thank you.

1545
01:26:57,922 --> 01:26:58,650
Hey.

1546
01:27:00,791 --> 01:27:03,089
I'll always need you.

1547
01:27:04,995 --> 01:27:06,053
Come on.

1548
01:27:06,130 --> 01:27:07,654
Carmen Elizabeth Juanita...

1549
01:27:07,731 --> 01:27:09,494
Come here to your papa.

1550
01:27:09,567 --> 01:27:10,761
You okay hon?

1551
01:27:10,834 --> 01:27:12,563
All right. Information. Quick.

1552
01:27:12,636 --> 01:27:14,627
Okay we have the Transmooker device,

1553
01:27:14,705 --> 01:27:16,832
but we need to get off this island right now.

1554
01:27:16,907 --> 01:27:19,000
What do you think we're here for? Let's go.

1555
01:27:20,911 --> 01:27:22,708
We'll explain it on the way.

1556
01:27:22,780 --> 01:27:25,044
You won't believe who's behind this.

1557
01:27:26,050 --> 01:27:28,951
It couldn't be any more perfect.

1558
01:27:29,019 --> 01:27:31,613
This better not be what I think it is.

1559
01:27:31,689 --> 01:27:34,419
It's all being taken care of, all right?

1560
01:27:34,491 --> 01:27:36,356
Get the Transmooker device, Felix.

1561
01:27:36,427 --> 01:27:38,554
Felix?

1562
01:27:38,629 --> 01:27:40,392
Sorry Gregorio.

1563
01:27:50,040 --> 01:27:51,564
A little power goes a long way doesn't it?

1564
01:27:53,510 --> 01:27:55,705
Reprogram this one Gerti.

1565
01:27:55,779 --> 01:27:58,771
I want to start by wiping the Cortez family

1566
01:27:58,849 --> 01:28:00,407
from the face of the Earth.

1567
01:28:00,484 --> 01:28:01,883
Uncle Felix how could you?

1568
01:28:01,952 --> 01:28:03,749
I'm not your uncle.

1569
01:28:03,821 --> 01:28:05,550
But we treated you like family.

1570
01:28:05,623 --> 01:28:07,523
Donnagon said if I joined him

1571
01:28:07,591 --> 01:28:11,220
he -- he wouldn't get rid of me like he's gonna do to you guys.

1572
01:28:11,295 --> 01:28:12,762
You can't argue with that.

1573
01:28:12,830 --> 01:28:14,661
Do you still have power in your watch?

1574
01:28:14,732 --> 01:28:16,666
Yep.

1575
01:28:16,734 --> 01:28:18,668
Programming complete Father.

1576
01:28:18,736 --> 01:28:19,828
Thank you Gerti.

1577
01:28:19,903 --> 01:28:21,837
Try remote-piloting the choppers.

1578
01:28:24,708 --> 01:28:28,508
Well Cortezes, any last words?

1579
01:28:28,579 --> 01:28:30,308
None that I can say in front of my children.

1580
01:28:30,381 --> 01:28:32,178
Not to mention your mother.

1581
01:28:32,249 --> 01:28:34,080
Ah.

1582
01:28:34,151 --> 01:28:35,641
-- Huh? -- Huh? -- Oh!

1583
01:28:40,891 --> 01:28:44,418
Let's settle this the old-fashioned way.

1584
01:28:44,494 --> 01:28:46,189
Aah!

1585
01:28:46,263 --> 01:28:48,288
-- Kick his butt! -- Yeah kick his butt!

1586
01:28:49,099 --> 01:28:50,623
-- Uh! -- Not like that.

1587
01:28:50,700 --> 01:28:52,668
-- Aah! -- Uh!

1588
01:28:52,736 --> 01:28:54,169
Headbutt.

1589
01:28:55,138 --> 01:28:56,105
-- Uh! -- Uh!

1590
01:28:56,172 --> 01:28:57,639
-- Ohh! -- Ohh!

1591
01:28:57,707 --> 01:29:00,005
-- Ohh. Uh. -- Uhh.

1592
01:29:00,076 --> 01:29:01,134
Oh.

1593
01:29:01,211 --> 01:29:02,473
Uhh.

1594
01:29:02,545 --> 01:29:03,637
Sleeper hold.

1595
01:29:03,713 --> 01:29:04,839
Ahh!

1596
01:29:04,915 --> 01:29:06,644
Ohh! Ahh!

1597
01:29:06,716 --> 01:29:08,343
Use his own weight against him.

1598
01:29:08,418 --> 01:29:09,385
Yeah.

1599
01:29:09,452 --> 01:29:11,113
-- Aah! -- Aah!

1600
01:29:11,187 --> 01:29:12,347
-- Uhh! -- Uhh!

1601
01:29:12,422 --> 01:29:14,413
-- Ohh! -- Ohh! -- Ohh!

1602
01:29:14,491 --> 01:29:15,788
Ah get up!

1603
01:29:15,859 --> 01:29:17,383
Do what I showed you last night!

1604
01:29:17,460 --> 01:29:18,392
Uh!

1605
01:29:18,461 --> 01:29:19,450
Suplex.

1606
01:29:19,529 --> 01:29:21,190
-- Uhh! Ohh! -- Uh!

1607
01:29:23,266 --> 01:29:24,233
-- Uhh! -- Uhh!

1608
01:29:24,301 --> 01:29:25,131
Oh!

1609
01:29:25,201 --> 01:29:27,533
-- Even I can fight better than that. -- Mom!

1610
01:29:27,604 --> 01:29:30,368
Triple backflip!

1611
01:29:30,440 --> 01:29:32,567
Uh! Ooh! Uh! Ooh!

1612
01:29:32,642 --> 01:29:34,803
Uhh! Uh!

1613
01:29:34,878 --> 01:29:36,846
Uhhhhhh.

1614
01:29:52,295 --> 01:29:54,593
Aaaaaaahhhhhhh!

1615
01:29:54,664 --> 01:29:56,063
Uh! Huh?

1616
01:29:59,769 --> 01:30:01,760
Gerti?

1617
01:30:01,838 --> 01:30:03,032
What did you --

1618
01:30:03,106 --> 01:30:04,698
Why?

1619
01:30:04,774 --> 01:30:06,605
Oh don't even get me started.

1620
01:30:06,676 --> 01:30:08,166
Just wait till Mom finds out

1621
01:30:08,244 --> 01:30:10,508
you tried to take over the world again.

1622
01:30:10,580 --> 01:30:12,411
No. Please please please.

1623
01:30:12,482 --> 01:30:15,212
D-Don't tell your mother.

1624
01:30:15,285 --> 01:30:16,445
Please?

1625
01:30:45,148 --> 01:30:46,308
Uh hello.

1626
01:30:49,853 --> 01:30:52,378
By order of the president,

1627
01:30:52,455 --> 01:30:55,424
you've been temporarily disavowed.

1628
01:31:01,965 --> 01:31:03,432
You're fired.

1629
01:31:03,500 --> 01:31:05,593
Uh.

1630
01:31:05,668 --> 01:31:08,466
Looks like I lost this round, but I'll be back.

1631
01:31:08,538 --> 01:31:10,165
Hopefully you're on the good side next time.

1632
01:31:10,240 --> 01:31:11,969
We'll see but...

1633
01:31:13,410 --> 01:31:15,901
...you never know.

1634
01:31:15,979 --> 01:31:17,606
Don't worry.

1635
01:31:17,680 --> 01:31:20,274
He gets out of line, I'll straighten him out.

1636
01:31:20,350 --> 01:31:21,977
You go Gerti.

1637
01:31:27,123 --> 01:31:29,614
You tried to save us.

1638
01:31:29,692 --> 01:31:30,852
Why?

1639
01:31:37,734 --> 01:31:39,599
Because you are my family.

1640
01:31:41,237 --> 01:31:43,705
You know...

1641
01:31:43,773 --> 01:31:45,673
there isn't a man on this Earth

1642
01:31:45,742 --> 01:31:48,643
we'd ever think would be good enough for our daughter,

1643
01:31:48,711 --> 01:31:49,973
but um...

1644
01:31:50,046 --> 01:31:52,640
You come pretty close.

1645
01:31:58,221 --> 01:31:59,950
By order of the president,

1646
01:32:00,023 --> 01:32:02,856
you are the new director of the O.S.S.

1647
01:32:02,926 --> 01:32:05,690
Congratulations.

1648
01:32:05,762 --> 01:32:06,786
Do --

1649
01:32:06,863 --> 01:32:08,660
are they --

1650
01:32:14,070 --> 01:32:16,368
Level one.

1651
01:32:17,574 --> 01:32:19,007
No thanks.

1652
01:32:19,075 --> 01:32:20,872
You don't want it?

1653
01:32:20,944 --> 01:32:22,411
I'm leaving the O.S.S.

1654
01:32:22,479 --> 01:32:25,676
I've seen what it takes to be a top spy,

1655
01:32:25,748 --> 01:32:29,184
and I think I can be better use to the world

1656
01:32:29,252 --> 01:32:33,154
by just being the best...me.

1657
01:32:33,223 --> 01:32:35,384
But what about all the cool gadgets?

1658
01:32:35,458 --> 01:32:38,325
I got the best gadget right here.

1659
01:32:38,394 --> 01:32:43,491
Use number one -- a stylish bracelet.

1660
01:32:43,566 --> 01:32:44,931
See ya around?

1661
01:32:45,001 --> 01:32:46,901
Yes.

1662
01:32:53,676 --> 01:32:55,166
Go ahead. Say it.

1663
01:32:55,244 --> 01:32:56,370
What?

1664
01:32:56,445 --> 01:32:59,608
I told you so.

1665
01:33:00,850 --> 01:33:02,112
Never.

1666
01:33:04,020 --> 01:33:05,385
Wait.

1667
01:33:06,789 --> 01:33:08,518
Uh...

1668
01:33:10,760 --> 01:33:12,057
Thank you.

1669
01:33:12,128 --> 01:33:13,618
You got it boss.

1670
01:34:06,782 --> 01:34:08,579
-- Carmen! -- Carmen! -- Carmen! -- Carmen!

1671
01:34:08,651 --> 01:34:11,176
-- Carmen! -- Carmen! -- Carmen! -- Carmen!

1672
01:34:11,254 --> 01:34:13,449
-- Carmen! -- Carmen! -- Carmen! -- Carmen!

1673
01:34:13,523 --> 01:34:15,457
-- Carmen! -- Carmen! -- Carmen! -- Carmen!

1674
01:34:15,525 --> 01:34:17,117
I am not going out there.

1675
01:34:17,193 --> 01:34:18,319
Oh yes you are.

1676
01:34:18,394 --> 01:34:19,952
You're a spy you're undercover,

1677
01:34:20,029 --> 01:34:22,327
and you have to make them think you're a pop star.

1678
01:34:22,398 --> 01:34:23,763
I can't sing.

1679
01:34:23,833 --> 01:34:25,164
Who can these days?

1680
01:34:25,234 --> 01:34:27,896
I can't tell you how many artists have used

1681
01:34:27,970 --> 01:34:29,904
my Machete miracle microphone.

1682
01:34:29,972 --> 01:34:32,600
# I can't sing #

1683
01:34:32,675 --> 01:34:34,973
This'll make you dance like Britney Lopez.

1684
01:34:35,044 --> 01:34:36,602
Hey what about me?

1685
01:34:36,679 --> 01:34:39,944
This'll make you play like Angus Van Santana.

1686
01:34:40,016 --> 01:34:40,948
Cool.

1687
01:34:41,017 --> 01:34:42,245
Now get out there and rock!

1688
