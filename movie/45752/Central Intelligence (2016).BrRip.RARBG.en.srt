1
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:18,329
And now, it's time for a breakdown.

2
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,808
Mmm, mmm, mmm, yeah...

3
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,083
Man, I told you Robbie Wheirdicht
showers here during first period.

4
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:47,971
Why doesn't he just shower at home
like a normal person?

5
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:50,045
Look at him.

6
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,043
Does anything about that
look normal to you?

7
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:56,451
You know, he's actually
a pretty good dancer.

8
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:01,368
I mean, fuck that guy is different!

9
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,361
Let's wreck him.

10
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,882
Hey, Weird Dick!

11
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:09,201
Come on.

12
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,810
Finally, young ladies and young gentlemen,

13
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:15,851
it is my pleasure
to announce that the winner

14
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,129
of the National High School
Student of the Year Award

15
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,810
is none other than your very own

16
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,849
two-time student body president,

17
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,482
the captain of
Central High's All Valley track team,

18
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,165
president of the drama club

19
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:31,767
and the senior voted
"Most Likely to Succeed."

20
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,480
I gotta tell you folks,
after 40 years as an educator,

21
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,483
he is my favorite student.

22
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,366
I wish he were my son

23
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,682
if I were medically able to have children.

24
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,291
He's everybody's
favorite all-around guy...

25
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,329
Calvin "The Golden Jet" Joyner! Come on!

26
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,527
Golden Jet! Golden Jet! Golden Jet!

27
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,691
Oh, my goodness.

28
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:17,527
Wow! Wow, guys.

29
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,490
Hey! How about a hand
for Principal Kent, huh?

30
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:21,687
Huh?

31
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,720
Honestly, if my mom
was into white guys, it would be you.

32
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:25,881
I know it would, okay?

33
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:31,524
Well, as we all know,
this is our last assembly,

34
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,763
which means this is the last time
in front of you guys

35
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:37,321
that I'll be able to tell
the most beautiful girl in the world...

36
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,888
I'm talking about you, Maggie Johnson,

37
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:43,567
that I love you. I love you, baby. I do.

38
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,563
I'm gonna put it in my pocket.

39
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,324
I'll save it.

40
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:48,481
Okay.

41
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:52,087
All right, guys. We're seniors now.

42
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,882
And once we get those diplomas,

43
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:58,010
the decisions that we make after that
are all up to us.

44
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:00,921
I don't know what path
life is gonna take me on.

45
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,605
But I can promise you all this...

46
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,450
That I, for one, will push myself

47
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,489
at every stage, at every step.

48
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:09,160
So, I got one question to ask.

49
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:12,768
I got one question for
the graduating class of 1996

50
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,206
and that's "Will you..."

51
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,969
Check out my Weird Dick!

52
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:44,290
Hey. Here, here, man.

53
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,885
Thank you.

54
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,967
Well, there's no coming back from that.

55
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:08,966
Calvin Joyner, everybody,

56
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:11,845
voted "Most Likely to Succeed."

57
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:15,647
Golden Jet! Golden Jet! Golden Jet!

58
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,285
Yo. Check it.

59
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,290
Oh, come on, man.
I don't want to see that.

60
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,441
Oh, no, no, it's my dick.

61
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,290
I know what it is. I don't want to see it.

62
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,601
Hilarious.

63
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,250
No, I'm working on this new sexting app.

64
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,481
It's kind of like Instagram, right?

65
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:17,766
But, instead of filters,

66
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,251
it just makes your junk look huge.

67
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,329
Like, three to six inches bigger.

68
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,080
It's called "Junk Mail." Clever, right?

69
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:26,322
- No, and here's why...
- Sorry, hang on, one second.

70
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,051
I'm just gonna...

71
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:29,841
What are you doing?

72
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:36,524
Okay, and send.

73
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,445
Sorry, you were saying something boring.

74
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,000
You just sent a dick pic.

75
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,730
It's called dating, grandma. Look it up.

76
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:44,002
Why are you all cranky-pants
this morning, huh?

77
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,606
Oh. It's because Ethan got promoted
instead of you?

78
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:48,886
Ethan got promoted?

79
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,248
Youngest senior associate
in the history of the firm.

80
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,004
Corner office, the whole deal.

81
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,321
Didn't he used to be your assistant?

82
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,968
Who cares? Hey, you should
come to lunch with us.

83
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,565
We're gonna be celebrating his pro-mosh!

84
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,688
It'll probably be good for you
to kiss the ring a bit.

85
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,645
"Kiss the ring a bit"?

86
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,848
Hey, you play your chessboard
however you like, okay?

87
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:09,364
Me, lunch today?
I'm gonna French kiss that thing.

88
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,840
Aah...

89
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:14,290
I can't. I'm taking my wife
to lunch today, so...

90
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,726
All right. Bummer for you.

91
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,087
Right?

92
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,130
Can you just get out of my face?

93
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,805
# Blessed.

94
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:40,321
To a guy I not only consider my coworker,

95
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:41,885
but my personal friend.

96
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,049
- To Ethan!
- Cheers!

97
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,489
Do you wanna move tables?
I know this kind of sucks.

98
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:50,369
No, no. It doesn't suck.

99
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,846
Hey, if I wanted to get
one of those ice teas

100
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,923
but I want most of it to be bourbon...
What is that called?

101
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:57,881
Okay. How about we change the topic
to something a little more fun?

102
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,810
Anything else, please.

103
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,161
Oh, how about...

104
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:03,402
This is the dress
that I'm thinking about wearing.

105
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,201
Oh!

106
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,125
Honey, I want every single girl
to be jealous tomorrow night.

107
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,647
Oh.

108
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:10,961
What?

109
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,451
I just... I just don't want to go.

110
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:14,563
Calvin, it's our 20-year
high school reunion.

111
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:15,921
I'm not gonna go without you.

112
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,208
We agreed we were going. I RSVP'd for us.

113
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:21,011
I just changed my mind. That's all.

114
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,525
Okay. I see.

115
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:25,081
You're disappointed
about the promotion. I get it.

116
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:27,242
This is not about the promotion.

117
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,046
Okay, this has to do with me
not wanting to spend my Friday night

118
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,884
answering the
"What are you doing now?" question.

119
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:33,087
That's what I'll get all night.

120
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:35,049
"Hey, Calvin, what are you doing now?"
"I'm an accountant."

121
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,321
"An accountant? Really?

122
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,845
"I thought you would be the governor, man.

123
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,401
"Wait a minute. Didn't you get voted
'Most Likely to Succeed'?

124
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:41,925
"I guess we missed that one."

125
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,451
Is this why you've been
so weird and moody lately?

126
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,965
'Cause you're freaking out
about the reunion?

127
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,167
- No.
- And what's the matter

128
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,890
with being an accountant?
You love your job.

129
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,530
No, you love your job.

130
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,250
I'm good at my job.
It's not the same thing.

131
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,401
Honey, that's not fair.

132
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,210
You're a partner at your firm.

133
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:58,245
Instead, I work in a building with a giant,
inflatable gorilla out in front of it.

134
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,209
Look, I don't want to be
the guy that peaked in high school

135
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,328
and, after he peaked,
his life went like this...

136
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,650
I don't know the sound
that that thing makes,

137
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:07,841
but you know what I'm trying to do.

138
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,161
I'm the guy that went down, okay?

139
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,407
- Yeah.
- Then my life

140
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:11,846
down here became a disappointment.

141
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,286
That's what I'll be.

142
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,441
Wow.

143
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:16,521
What?

144
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:20,560
I had no idea that your life with me was
such a soundless, crashing disappointment!

145
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,370
Don't do that.

146
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,443
- That's not... Don't do that.
- That's the sound.

147
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,125
You want to know the sound
I'm about to make right now?

148
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,361
The sound of me not going.

149
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:28,931
That's the sound I'm making.

150
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,241
I'm not going.

151
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,241
Yeah.

152
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,889
Mmm-mmm-mmm.

153
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,041
No.

154
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:56,169
Not going to that.

155
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,281
Bob Stone?

156
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:16,801
Okay.

157
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,241
Hello?

158
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,807
- Hey.
- Girl, you scared me.

159
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:33,606
- I did?
- Yes. I thought that you were...

160
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:36,648
I just... On the...

161
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,971
Never mind. Hey, I'm glad you called.

162
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,401
I'm sorry about lunch today.

163
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,247
I'm an idiot, babe.

164
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,050
I don't even know
what's going on with me right now.

165
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,725
- I really don't.
- Yeah?

166
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,882
Actually, honey,

167
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,889
that's what I was calling
to talk to you about.

168
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:55,529
Look, honey, I think that
we should see someone.

169
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:59,564
What do you mean, "Someone"?
What do you mean?

170
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,842
See someone, like a therapist.

171
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:04,328
Honey, black people don't go to therapy.

172
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,571
We go to barbershops.

173
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,245
That's where we talk out our problems.

174
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,721
Or we watch the movie Barbershop.
One or the other.

175
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,450
Look, my parents were really unhappy

176
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,523
for a long time before they got divorced.

177
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:18,162
And maybe if they saw someone sooner,
they would still be married.

178
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:21,090
I just want to nip this thing in the bud,
whatever it is.

179
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,601
I don't want to end up like my parents.

180
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:27,130
Wassup?

181
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:35,847
Please, just do it for me, if not for you.

182
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,121
All right. Uh...

183
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:41,930
- When? When do you want to do it?
- Really?

184
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:44,249
The doctor said
he could see us at 6:00 p.m.

185
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:47,287
Um... 6:00 p.m., when? Tonight?

186
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,283
Yeah. Yeah, is that a problem?

187
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:53,365
Holy shit! Robbie Wheirdicht?

188
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,891
Calvin, honey? Hello?

189
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,485
Um, yeah.

190
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:01,564
I can't. I already
made plans for tonight, baby.

191
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,961
- Plans with who?
- With Bob Stone.

192
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,162
Who's Bob Stone?
That sounds like a fake name.

193
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:09,642
No, no. You remember
Robbie Wheirdicht, from high school?

194
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:10,801
No.

195
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,809
The guy who got beaten up
by Trisha Demarco at homecoming?

196
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,087
No.

197
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,561
The kid that tried to rap along to
Coolio's 1,2,3,4 at the talent show

198
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,324
but then he kinda lost his way,
midway through

199
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,130
so he just started bopping his head,
and he stood there?

200
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,805
No. Nothing.

201
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,162
The guy who got thrown out the gym,
butt-ass-naked, senior year?

202
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,321
Oh, my God, yeah!

203
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:27,130
Why wouldn't you start with that?

204
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,890
Because I thought that was kind of mean.
I don't know.

205
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,605
He never came back
to school after that, right?

206
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:32,967
Like, not for finals
or graduation or anything.

207
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:35,003
Didn't he join the military or something?

208
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:39,607
I'm not sure. I don't know if he did or not,
but he changed his name to "Bob Stone"

209
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,842
and apparently he's in town
for the high school reunion.

210
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,048
He wants to go to dinner tonight,
and I kinda already said "yes."

211
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,241
- Okay.
- If you want me to cancel,

212
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,845
I will. You know?

213
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,365
If that's what you want, I don't mind.

214
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:51,162
Mmm-mmm. I mean,
it's a little weird, but whatever.

215
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:53,687
I'll just see if the doctor
can fit us in tomorrow.

216
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,968
- How about at lunch time?
- Okay. All right, fine.

217
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,360
Okay, good. I love you.

218
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:59,249
I love you, too, babe. I do.

219
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:05,842
- Oh, my...
- What is that?

220
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,809
- Okay.
- Calvin? Are you...

221
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:08,961
Love you. Bye-bye.

222
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,081
No!

223
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,886
Stop, stop!

224
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,446
Hey, man. I...

225
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,688
Hey! What's up, guys?

226
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,806
Congratulations on that promotion, man.

227
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:22,961
It's quite the thing.

228
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,966
Thank you.
Hey, that's not work appropriate.

229
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,281
Yup.

230
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,044
Not cool, man. Not cool.

231
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,244
Hey, forward that to me.

232
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:46,921
For real man, seriously?

233
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,764
Yeah. Watch it, punk.

234
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,651
Excuse you, too.

235
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:13,401
My man!

236
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:14,971
Back the fuck up!

237
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:17,165
- Whoa!
- Back up, man!

238
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,329
Fine. I'll give you these fists.

239
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,726
I'll fist your ass.

240
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,451
Calvin. It's me, Bob.

241
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,442
What? Sorry, do I know you?

242
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,401
Do you know...

243
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:30,564
Robbie Wheirdicht from high school!

244
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,404
Are you kidding? What?

245
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:36,281
- Wait, you're Robbie Wheirdicht?
- Yeah!

246
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,725
God, man, look at you!
You've lost, like, 200 pounds!

247
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,484
I see you gained it back in muscle.

248
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:43,244
Oh, my God! You look great!

249
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:45,329
- No, you look great!
- Stop it.

250
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,847
No, you haven't changed
since high school, dude!

251
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:51,249
No, you're just sexy as dick right now.

252
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:53,448
You don't look somebody
in the eyes and say that.

253
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,647
Hey, let's get hammered.

254
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,048
I got an early day at work,
so I'll probably...

255
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,281
No, come on, I'm buying!

256
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,441
Oh, shit.

257
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,001
Mmm.

258
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:04,040
I'm sorry, man. I am blown away right now.

259
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:06,402
Dude, you used to be Fat Robbie.

260
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,881
Look at you!
This is like a total transformation.

261
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,690
You look like Hercules or somebody.

262
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:12,205
What did you do? Come on, give it to me.

263
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:14,328
- I didn't do much, really.
- Stop it.

264
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,842
All right. I just did one thing.

265
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,207
Come on, I need to know.

266
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:20,847
I worked out six hours a day, every day,

267
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,490
for the last 20 years straight.

268
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:26,646
- I mean, anybody can do it, right?
- Yeah.

269
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:31,566
Yeah. You know, I've gotten into hot yoga.

270
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,651
I started doing some sessions.

271
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:35,801
Uh-huh.

272
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,480
Nice unicorn, man.

273
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:40,847
Oh, yeah, I'm big-time into 'corns.

274
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,166
So magical, right?

275
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,527
You know, they're the most
lethal animal on the planet.

276
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:45,921
Here you go.

277
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:48,082
Guys, my name's Lexi.

278
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,446
Just let me know if you need anything.

279
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:50,841
Okay.

280
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:54,369
I mean, like, anything at all.

281
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,211
Okie-dokie.

282
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:59,571
You're funny. Do you ever, like, Snapchat?

283
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:02,371
- Oh, no. You know...
- I wasn't talking to you.

284
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,041
No, no, no. I don't do that.

285
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,726
I'm just catching up
with an old friend from high school.

286
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,568
Aw. You're so sweet.

287
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,411
I think unicorns are sexy, too.

288
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,609
That must happen to you
all the time, right?

289
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,081
Ah, nah.

290
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,409
I mean, all that meaningless sex is just...

291
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,210
It's not my bag anymore, CJ.

292
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:25,721
No, now, I'm looking for
more of an emotional connection.

293
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,001
The next woman I lay with,

294
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:28,924
she's gonna be beautiful on the inside,

295
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,764
just as much as she is on the outside.

296
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:34,086
Hey, wait. Whatever happened to that
girl that you liked in high school?

297
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,931
Oh, God, man. The "Doogie Howser" girl.

298
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,923
She was 14, but somehow she was a senior.

299
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,206
She wore a cape.

300
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:43,161
- Darla McGuckian.
- Darla McGuckian.

301
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:45,084
"Yucky Gucky."

302
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,761
- Didn't she have a lazy eye or something?
- Two of 'em.

303
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,127
Right.

304
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,321
Hey, but listen,
I don't wanna talk about me.

305
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:51,481
I wanna talk about you.

306
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:52,926
I heard that
you and Maggie Johnson got hitched.

307
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,605
Oh, yeah.

308
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:56,569
Yeah, man, right after college.

309
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:00,122
Wow! The prettiest girl in school,
and the coolest guy in school!

310
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,281
Oh, man, I got lucky.

311
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,771
I mean, you guys are like
a power couple, dude!

312
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:04,445
- No, no.
- Yes!

313
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:07,444
You're like Taylor Swift
and whoever she's dating right now.

314
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:10,080
- Power.
- Uh, thanks!

315
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,725
Yeah. You guys got kids?

316
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,285
No. No kids yet.

317
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:15,363
We planned on it after college,

318
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:18,569
but Maggie went to law school,
I kept changing jobs.

319
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:22,128
You know, having kids just
isn't in our cards right now.

320
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:23,281
Not at this point, that's all.

321
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:24,487
- Oh, okay.
- Yeah.

322
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:28,128
I don't wanna talk about
me and Maggie and myself.

323
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,691
What about you? What are you doing?

324
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,444
I didn't even ask you, man.
What do you do for work?

325
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,485
I'm a government contractor.

326
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:36,331
Okay, that's cool.
Like, what, buildings and stuff?

327
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:38,241
Yeah, sort of.

328
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,326
But I kinda just got fired.

329
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,608
- Oh, shit! I'm sorry, man.
- Oh, it's okay.

330
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:45,445
Screw those guys, anyway.
They're way too corporate.

331
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:48,490
'Cause dudes like me and you,
I mean, we're alpha dogs, right?

332
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:50,523
I mean, we're pathfinders
and trailblazers.

333
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:53,365
And we don't listen
to what anyone tells us, right?

334
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,251
- Yeah, right.
- Yeah.

335
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:00,849
I mean, come on, man,
I sorta path-find a little bit

336
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:05,130
along certain preapproved parameters
that are given to me.

337
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:08,682
I'm willing to path-find
but it's all about how it's set up.

338
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:13,243
But within the box that I have, I go nuts.
You'll be surprised.

339
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,646
I had a guy tell me the other day,

340
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:17,644
"Hey, Calvin, you know,
I need those accounting numbers back

341
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,211
"from, you know, the file."

342
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:22,210
- I said, "Go fuck yourself, Jim."
- Yeah.

343
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:25,603
I didn't say it
because I wasn't in my box,

344
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:29,603
- but I thought about it.
- Exactly! Yeah! Yeah!

345
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,650
I got an idea. Let's do shots!

346
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:32,881
No!

347
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:34,804
I'm sorry for saying it like that, but no.

348
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,644
I haven't had shots
in almost 10 years, man.

349
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:39,047
What? Come on, we have to!
We're celebrating!

350
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:41,041
Celebrating what?

351
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,362
Celebrating that I'm hanging
with the coolest kid in high school.

352
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,363
- Stop it.
- Calvin Joyner!

353
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,729
The Golden Jet.

354
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,691
You got to be shitting me. Wow!

355
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,129
I haven't... God!

356
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,722
It's been forever since I heard that, man!

357
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:57,881
- I'll do one.
- All right!

358
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:59,041
- One shot.
- Shots!

359
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:00,321
No. One shot.

360
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,562
Just one, okay? Bob, it's been a while.

361
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:05,007
Oh, shit! You remember this?

362
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,725
This was the jammy-jam!

363
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,882
What's that? Is that a fanny pack, Bob?

364
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:10,570
Hell, yeah! Dude, you want one?

365
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,085
No, it's okay.

366
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,685
I got two at home. I'll hook you up.

367
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:16,042
Leather pack for The Jet.

368
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,247
Fanny!

369
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,686
Shit.

370
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:21,209
What the hell did I get myself into?

371
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,370
Mmm. Mmm-mmm-mmm.

372
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:26,411
Hey, sir, somebody's
actually sitting there.

373
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,762
- Yeah, someone was.
- No! Hey, man!

374
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:30,411
Hey, you don't see
the sweatshirt right here?

375
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,648
- Man, somebody's sitting here.
- Move your meat, lose your seat.

376
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,361
Dude, you don't
have to be a dick about it.

377
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:35,601
Somebody's sitting in the chair.

378
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:38,771
Bro, are you seriously
gonna go there, bro?

379
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,568
'Cause there's only one way back, bro.

380
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,848
Through intensive care, bro.

381
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,761
Was that the last "bro"?
'Cause if it was, then I'll talk.

382
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,206
That supposed to be funny?

383
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,771
- Dude...
- You a comedian now?

384
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:53,088
'Cause you don't look like
Dane Cook to me, bro.

385
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:54,730
Hey, now!

386
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:56,601
What's the rumpus?

387
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:57,841
You know... There's no problem, man.

388
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,082
Let's just go to another table.
Get your jacket. Let's go.

389
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,523
- No, we're not gonna go anywhere.
- Listen to your pussy friend.

390
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:05,241
Those gym muscles
aren't scaring anybody, pal.

391
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,448
- Oh, these?
- Let's just go. It's okay.

392
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:10,120
No, we're not gonna go.
This man insulted you.

393
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:12,089
And we're not gonna leave
until he apologizes.

394
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,288
- It's okay.
- Hey, we got a problem here?

395
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,482
- No, no.
- Yeah, we got a big problem.

396
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:19,325
Your friend, here,
really insulted my friend

397
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:20,481
and he needs to apologize.

398
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:21,641
I don't think he does.

399
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:22,801
He doesn't.

400
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,849
Oh, you know what, man?

401
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,287
I think this whole situation's
getting a little out of control.

402
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:28,601
I can fix this whole thing.

403
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:31,127
I'll order some nachos. The "Explosions."

404
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:33,647
It's got four cheeses!
Let's eat 'em together.

405
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:34,847
You know what? You take them.

406
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,041
Let's go.

407
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,326
Nah. We're not going anywhere, Jet.

408
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:38,970
This whole thing will be over in a jiff.

409
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,645
Hey, how about this?

410
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:43,320
Why don't you and your boyfriend
apologize to Big Rick here

411
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:45,687
and then go jerk each other
in the parking lot?

412
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,127
That's a lot...

413
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,327
Yeah. You're right, CJ.

414
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,131
That's a lot of homophobia
coming out of a very angry man.

415
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,807
You need to go get that looked at
by a trained professional.

416
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:56,167
But, since you have
escalated this whole scenario

417
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:57,810
by bringing what I can only assume

418
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:00,361
is an unlicensed firearm
into this public place,

419
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:02,682
endangering the lives
of all these innocent people,

420
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:05,650
I can no longer,
in good conscience, walk away

421
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,529
and jerk anyone off in the parking lot.

422
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:09,808
I'm afraid we ain't going anywhere.

423
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,166
It's time for you to get out of here, pal.

424
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:12,805
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

425
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,443
There's four of us, tough guy.

426
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,611
Yeah. I got that.

427
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:20,961
All right. Before this whole thing goes down,
you should know one thing about me.

428
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,121
What's that?

429
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:27,530
I don't like bullies.

430
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,041
Let's go, Jet.

431
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,360
Yes.

432
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:46,366
Oh, my God! I hope he's Catholic.

433
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:50,885
Oh, my God!

434
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:52,525
What the hell was that?

435
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:54,569
Bob, that was amazing!
I've never seen anything like that!

436
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,404
You took the one guy,
you hit him like this.

437
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:57,721
He couldn't breathe.

438
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,331
I sat there, I'm looking at him...

439
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:00,720
You talkin' to him like,
"I don't like bullies."

440
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,490
I was like, "That's not a good line."
But it was!

441
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:03,641
I didn't even know you could fight!

442
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:06,571
You had a unicorn shirt, a fanny pack,
and it totally worked!

443
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:08,922
You were like Jason Bourne,
man, but with jorts!

444
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:11,401
How did you do that?
Where'd you learn that stuff?

445
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,409
I took a couple classes at work.

446
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:14,931
I hope I didn't go too far.

447
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:16,206
I'm sorry about ruining the night, Jet.

448
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:19,250
Ruin my night?
No! It was the coolest thing ever, man!

449
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,851
- Really?
- Yes!

450
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,321
To see my boy go in and whoop ass
on those idiots back there.

451
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:24,641
Dude, that was amazing!

452
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,723
Wait, we're boys?

453
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:28,441
Yeah, we boys.

454
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,127
Wow. I...

455
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,001
Never had a boy.

456
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:38,847
- That's awesome! Come here!
- Oh, wait.

457
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,524
Stop. What's going on, man?

458
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:43,284
- I'm a hugger!
- What're you doing?

459
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:47,729
Hey! I got an idea.
Let's roll. Here's my bike.

460
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,041
Wait. That's your bike?

461
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,929
Yeah. Kawasaki 800!

462
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,525
I know what the bike is.

463
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:55,404
I had the same bike in high school, man.

464
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,204
- You still ride?
- No, man.

465
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:58,361
I haven't ridden a bike in years!

466
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,800
Come on, let's roll.

467
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,485
Where? Where you trying to go?

468
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:07,451
I know the perfect spot. Come on, Jet.

469
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,970
You know, why not? Why not?

470
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:12,327
After this... Yeah, okay!

471
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:13,801
Let's roll.

472
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:19,003
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Hey, Bob! Slow, slow, slow!

473
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:20,641
Bob, hey, hey!

474
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:29,849
God, this is so crazy, man.

475
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,729
This brings back so many memories.

476
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:34,121
I don't know, CJ.

477
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:35,850
I mean, high school
wasn't easy for me, man.

478
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,685
I don't know if you know this,
but I didn't have many friends back then.

479
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:40,481
What?

480
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:42,690
- Really?
- No.

481
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:43,887
I don't know why I thought...

482
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:45,371
True story.

483
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:48,364
Man, I thought high school
was gonna be like Sixteen Candles

484
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:50,329
and I was gonna be like Molly Ringwald.

485
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,971
Sure, things were difficult
in the beginning, but then, by the end,

486
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,366
everything worked out.

487
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:56,602
And Jake Ryan picked her up
in that red Porsche.

488
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:57,841
What-what?

489
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:59,041
You ever see that movie?

490
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:02,368
I'm black, so I don't know the...

491
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:04,204
You gotta see it, dude.

492
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:07,364
Total classic.
It's my favorite all-time movie.

493
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:10,649
Then I realized high school
was nothing like Sixteen Candles.

494
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:13,723
And I'll never be like Molly Ringwald.

495
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,484
Yeah, well, depends on who you ask.

496
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:19,205
That's the thing. For me, I...

497
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:21,881
What's going on?

498
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:24,320
Oh, wow.

499
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:27,804
Hey, man, I just wanna say that
I'm really sorry

500
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:30,406
about what Trevor and those guys
did to you back then.

501
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:40,050
No biggie. I don't even
think about it anymore. No.

502
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:41,841
Okay, good.

503
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,730
Yeah. Here's the secret.
You know what I did, Jet?

504
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:46,326
I took all that stuff
and I balled it up real tight

505
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:49,006
and then I shoved it way down deep.

506
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,522
And I just pretty much ignore it.

507
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:54,725
You know, that sounds
really unhealthy, Bob.

508
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,240
Hey, I gotta tell you.

509
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,050
You were the only one
who helped me out that day.

510
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:59,890
In the gym? Remember that?

511
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:02,407
And you gave me your letterman's jacket!

512
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:05,649
Hey, not for nothing,
but I never got that jacket back, man.

513
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,081
Huh!

514
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:09,049
Really? Strange.

515
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:12,561
Hey, but listen, I just wanna thank you
for what you did for me that day.

516
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,006
That was really cool of you, Jet.

517
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:16,083
Stop, man.
It was the right thing to do, you know?

518
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:20,167
- You wanna hear something weird?
- What?

519
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:22,049
I have not been naked since that day.

520
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:23,531
I mean, not in front of anyone.

521
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:25,001
Never.

522
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:26,730
So, you're telling me
that for the last 20 years,

523
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:28,763
you've never been seen
in your birthday suit?

524
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,689
- No.
- So, what about when you have sex?

525
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:33,242
I keep it pitch-black,
just like Vin Diesel.

526
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:34,801
What?

527
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,811
You know I've been wondering,
whatever happened to Trevor anyway?

528
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:41,691
Did he get hit by a bus
or ripped apart by dogs

529
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,888
or die slowly of anything?

530
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:47,880
No. No, no.
He's a bigtime investment banker downtown.

531
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,687
- Oh, hey, cool.
- Yeah.

532
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:52,171
Good for him, man.

533
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:55,086
Hey, Bob, look,
if you ever wanna talk, I'm here.

534
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:57,210
So I don't mind, you know?

535
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:58,767
I don't mind at all, if you wanna...

536
00:25:58,920 --> 00:25:59,921
What?

537
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:03,084
Whoa.

538
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:06,167
This is all our stuff from our year!

539
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:09,164
Yeah. Must be getting ready
for the reunion tomorrow night.

540
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:10,367
Come on, man. Let's get out of here.

541
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:12,727
What? No! "Get out..."
Look, you're all over this!

542
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:16,242
Look at this.
Basketball, baseball, cross country.

543
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,640
Hamlet.

544
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:18,841
Prom King.

545
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,570
There's Darla McGuckian.

546
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:22,649
Synchronized swimming, that's so sexy.

547
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:25,366
This is like the Guinness Book
of Golden Jet Records right there.

548
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:27,960
I see that.

549
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:31,607
To be honest with you,
I don't even recognize this guy anymore.

550
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:33,850
This guy, here, he was gonna...

551
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,889
He was gonna conquer the world.

552
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,044
If 18-year-old me could see me now,

553
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:40,924
he'd probably think I was a total loser.

554
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:44,123
What? That's crazy talk!

555
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:45,805
- You're The Golden Jet, dude!
- Stop.

556
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:48,804
Stop, Bob. Spare me
with The Golden Jet shit.

557
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,682
I'm not The Golden Jet, man.
I'm an accountant.

558
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:53,245
That's my reality.

559
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:59,204
I just thought
I was meant for more, you know?

560
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:01,882
My life would be something special.

561
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:06,451
You know how they say every man
is the hero of his own story?

562
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:08,721
Was that in Twilight?

563
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:12,045
No, I don't think that's where it's from.

564
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:14,248
But those books are cool, right? Vampires!

565
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:16,442
And there's a wolf-boy.

566
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:21,401
I'm not... I'm not talking
about Twilight, Bob, okay?

567
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:22,721
I'm talking about the fact that
I don't feel like

568
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,644
I'm the hero of my own story. That's...

569
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,450
How are you not the hero
of your own story?

570
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:28,045
No one else can be!

571
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,964
Yo, CJ, I gotta be honest with you, man.

572
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:31,645
I mean, all this talk about Calvin Joyner

573
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:33,040
not feeling like he's a hero...

574
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,725
That's crazy talk, man.

575
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:36,844
No. No, it's not.

576
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,570
You were the best thing about high school.

577
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:40,411
I'll always believe in you.

578
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:42,881
Yo, do you remember
those backflips you used to do?

579
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:45,284
The crowd would go crazy!
I was there, too.

580
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:47,442
I was, like, "What? How's he do that?"

581
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:48,687
How did you do that?

582
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:52,244
I don't know. I just did it, man.

583
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:53,921
Exactly.

584
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:55,081
So, do it now.

585
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:58,884
No, no. You're crazy! No.

586
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,281
What's that?

587
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:01,487
What're you talking about? What's what?

588
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:03,244
- Golden Jet!
- No, stop it.

589
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:05,164
- Golden Jet!
- Okay, stop it!

590
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:06,845
- Golden Jet!
- All right.

591
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,331
Golden Jet!

592
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:11,370
I'm not gonna stop until
you do The Golden Jet flip!

593
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:12,521
Golden Jet!

594
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:14,921
All right, everybody, settle down.
Settle down!

595
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:17,606
If the crowd wants a Golden Jet flip,

596
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,489
then they gonna get a Golden Jet flip.

597
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:20,766
You go, girl!

598
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:26,689
Oh, God!

599
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:28,205
That was so close, Jet.

600
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:30,801
Here, buddy. Come on.

601
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,570
They must have just waxed these floors.

602
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,604
That was definitely a first, man.

603
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,485
Oh, man, I am beat.

604
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:42,041
Oh.

605
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:45,087
Hey, Jet!

606
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:48,682
Man, I had a great time tonight.

607
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:49,841
Whoa!

608
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,482
You know what?
I had a good time, too, man.

609
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,085
I feel like I needed this, you know?

610
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,447
Yeah. Yeah. Me, too!

611
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:57,961
Thank you.

612
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:00,561
My pleasure, amigo. Any time.

613
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:04,122
Hey, if there's ever anything
I can do for you, just say the word.

614
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:06,806
Wow. You really mean that?

615
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:08,367
Yeah.

616
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:11,330
I wasn't gonna bring it up,
but I might as well.

617
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:14,649
Lately, I've been having this problem
with my payroll account. And...

618
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:16,521
It's all screwed up, somehow.

619
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:20,083
You know, I was overseas
working for a while before I got fired.

620
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:23,164
So, it's kinda like
a forensic international account thingy

621
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:26,569
which, I think,
is kind of your specialty, right?

622
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:28,601
Um...

623
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,800
Yeah, no, it is.
I'll take a look at that for you.

624
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,161
You would? You would do that for me?

625
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:36,846
I've got the login info,
if you wanna crack open your computer,

626
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:38,280
we can do this!

627
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,290
Oh, you mean now?

628
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:42,568
- That's awesome! Yeah!
- Okay.

629
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,404
- Look at this!
- Hey, Bob...

630
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:45,607
Whoa!

631
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:47,006
Bob, you gotta keep your voice down!

632
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,286
Maggie's sleeping.

633
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,441
Wow.

634
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:54,323
This is a pretty serious international
account dossier you've got here.

635
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:57,649
Right? I just want to make sure
everything was hunky-dory.

636
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,809
Going to your router.

637
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:06,406
Now you're talking to me.

638
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:09,962
Bingo. I'm in.

639
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:12,767
Oh. That's great, Jet. Thank you, man!

640
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,482
I mean, just looking at it first-hand,

641
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:21,962
it kinda looks like it's a bunch of
off-shore escrow accounts.

642
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:23,645
These have been backwashed into

643
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:26,889
a series of domestic dummy accounts
for some reason.

644
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:29,611
I mean, the logs are all crazy, too.
You have China,

645
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,845
Syria, Iran.

646
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:34,685
This is an auction site, Bob!

647
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,604
These are bids. All of these.

648
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:40,331
This is hundreds of millions
of dollars in bids, right here.

649
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:43,411
And judging by this clock, here,
it says it's all gonna end tomorrow.

650
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:44,767
Whoa!

651
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:47,969
- What the hell? Why?
- What did...

652
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:49,565
- Oh! I'm sorry, Jet!
- Bob!

653
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:52,405
Jet, I'm so sorry! Oh, man.

654
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:54,847
- I'm all thumbs.
- It's my computer!

655
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:56,565
- I'm sorry.
- No! Please, Bob.

656
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:57,926
- I'm sorry, Jet.
- Leave it. I got it.

657
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:00,487
It's fine, Bob. It's fine. Just leave it.

658
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:01,801
The worst!

659
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:03,241
God!

660
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:06,041
Hey! What the hell was that on that site?

661
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,770
That didn't have
anything to do with payroll.

662
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:10,282
I don't know. I've never seen that before.

663
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:11,441
That was crazy.

664
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:13,881
Let's figure it out tomorrow
when we're bright-eyed and bushy-tailed.

665
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:16,361
What do you say, CJ? I am beat.

666
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:18,525
Hey, do you mind if I crash here?

667
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:20,646
Um...

668
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:22,721
No.

669
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:26,129
Let me go grab some blankets.

670
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:33,241
Hey, thanks for the jammies, Jet.

671
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:37,171
Okay, well, you can keep those.

672
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:39,129
Those are... Those are officially yours.

673
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:41,971
Yeah.

674
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,609
- All right.
- Oh.

675
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:46,930
You gonna sleep with your fanny pack.

676
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:50,004
Golden Jet! Yeah, it's my baby.

677
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:04,809
You need anything else? You're okay?

678
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:10,162
I can't believe I'm having a sleepover
at Calvin Joyner's house right now.

679
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:12,840
This is blowing my mind!

680
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:15,321
Okay.

681
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:16,881
Uh, good night, Bob.

682
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:19,041
Good night, Jet.

683
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:39,801
Me?

684
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:41,726
Yeah, you.

685
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:48,890
What the fuck?

686
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:53,000
One second.

687
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:58,926
Hold on.

688
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,447
Uh, may I help you?

689
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:06,125
Mr. Joyner, my name is Pamela Harris,

690
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:08,567
I'm with the Central Intelligence Agency.

691
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:11,087
Have you had any contact with this man?

692
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:14,331
Uh, yeah, he's on my...
He's on my couch, sleeping.

693
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:15,481
Target's in the house.

694
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:17,887
What's going on? Hey!

695
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:20,486
Excuse me. Excuse me!

696
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,247
Target's fled.

697
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:27,001
Shit.

698
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:28,366
Target's on the move.

699
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:29,601
Excuse me! What...

700
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:35,609
Hello, hey! Excuse me!

701
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:37,848
- ...and voice chatter in the vicinity.
- Hello! Excuse me!

702
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,241
If he's in the wind again,
it's gonna be your ass. Go now.

703
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:42,562
- Hello!
- Alert Langley, asset uncontained.

704
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:43,926
Excuse me!

705
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:45,882
- Can I help you?
- Hello!

706
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:47,320
It's my house. Is something going on?

707
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:49,926
Well, Mr. Joyner, your sleepover buddy,
Robert Wheirdicht,

708
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:53,562
AKA Bob Stone, AKA Bob Golden,
AKA Bob Jet,

709
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:55,729
is wanted for murder and treason

710
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:58,531
and is presently in possession
of highly classified state secrets

711
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:00,404
which he intends to sell to our enemies.

712
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:01,647
What?

713
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:05,600
And if he succeeds, it's gonna spark
a chain reaction of geopolitical events

714
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:06,921
that most of our predictive models

715
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:09,845
place somewhere between
World War III and outright Armageddon.

716
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,321
So, yeah, I guess you could say
something is going on.

717
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:13,721
Oh, you mind?

718
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:18,011
Creamer's in the fridge. What?

719
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:19,690
I don't need it.

720
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:21,729
What I do need is information.

721
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:24,724
I need you to tell me
everything and anything

722
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:26,644
about your contact with Agent Stone.

723
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:30,126
- Agent Stone?
- Bob, your friend Bob.

724
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:32,089
Come on. Stay with me, please.

725
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:35,322
Okay, I think there's a misunderstanding.

726
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:37,642
No. No, he is not my friend.

727
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:40,761
Then why did he list you as his emergency
contact in all his personnel forms?

728
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:42,121
I'm sorry... He what?

729
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:44,806
Bob Stone has no siblings, or parents,
or family of any kind.

730
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:48,607
You are the only person he listed
in his personal references.

731
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,040
Oh...

732
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:52,646
That's crazy, all right?
I barely even know the guy.

733
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,086
Then why was he sleeping on your couch?

734
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:55,446
Because we went out
and had drinks last night.

735
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:57,250
Oh, so you went out drinking
with your non-friend?

736
00:34:58,440 --> 00:34:59,441
Okay.

737
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:01,451
All right, let's... You're not...

738
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:02,967
Time out.

739
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:04,571
I'm pressing the time out button.

740
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:08,167
Okay? You guys barged in my house.
I pay my taxes.

741
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:11,603
So you're not gonna come here
and treat me like I'm the enemy, okay?

742
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,888
That's the first thing.
Now, if you want to get into facts...

743
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:15,650
You wanna talk about facts?

744
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:16,841
This is Facebook's fault.

745
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,001
Are you familiar with Facebook?

746
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:19,207
We surveil it.

747
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:20,930
He sent me a friend request.

748
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:22,525
That's how this whole thing started.

749
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:23,801
And you accepted?

750
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:26,249
Don't do that. Don't do that to me.

751
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:29,768
You give me a second. Okay?
Don't fire back like that.

752
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:32,048
First of all,
fuck Mark Zuckerberg, all right?

753
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:34,567
Now, I accepted because it was Facebook.

754
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:37,206
And it's rude when you don't accept it and I
don't know if the person on the other end

755
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:39,721
can see me not accept it.
That's why I accepted.

756
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,370
Are you nervous, Mr. Joyner?

757
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:42,727
Is it hot?

758
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,769
Are you getting hot?
Because I'm getting hot.

759
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:46,251
I'm not gonna take off my jacket

760
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,050
because that makes me look guilty.

761
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:50,601
And that's what you guys look for. Hmm?

762
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,367
Is this what a guilty man would do?

763
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:55,921
Look how comfortable I am.

764
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:59,086
I'm gonna lean up against this counter,
and I'm not gonna sweat.

765
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:03,566
I'm not gonna...
I'm not gonna look flustered at all.

766
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:05,603
I'm... Bring it.

767
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:07,246
What you want to know?

768
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:08,607
Hmm?

769
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:09,921
- Mr. Joyner.
- Yeah.

770
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:11,923
Bob Stone is a dangerous psychotic.

771
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:14,242
- You're lucky to be alive.
- Okay, listen to me.

772
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:17,250
Agent Harris, I don't know this man.

773
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:19,090
He's just a little weird kid
that I knew in high school.

774
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:20,805
He used to put Rice Krispies Treats
in my locker.

775
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:22,291
Sometimes I ate 'em, sometimes I didn't.

776
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:26,009
I wasn't in carbs back then 'cause I
didn't want that weight going to my hips.

777
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:28,441
As a man, you don't want big hips,
especially in high school.

778
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:31,081
Bottom line,
I have no allegiance to this man.

779
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:32,810
Zero ties, okay?

780
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,161
All ties are cut.

781
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:36,288
I cut them, so this is me and you.

782
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:38,444
So don't put me and him...

783
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:41,002
I ain't in this shit, okay?

784
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:44,087
All right, Mr. Joyner. Prove it.

785
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,564
Yeah, well, I need a second.

786
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:49,240
You gotta step outside.
I gotta take a shit.

787
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:50,606
This is a lot.

788
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:53,081
I got to go. Just give me a second, man!

789
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:55,848
- I'll be waiting.
- Jesus Christ!

790
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:08,965
All teams be advised,
we're Oscar Mike with the bait.

791
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:10,605
I'm sorry, did you just
call me "the bait"?

792
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:11,807
No.

793
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,047
Yeah, you did.
She just called me the bait.

794
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:14,201
Why am I the bait?

795
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:15,850
No, that doesn't sound like
something I'd ever say.

796
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:18,202
- You just said it.
- What's going on here?

797
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:20,010
Sir, I'm gonna need you to step aside.

798
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:22,322
This is a matter of national security.

799
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:23,840
Yeah, right! I love it.

800
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,367
What is this? Like a strippergram thing
to suck up to Ethan?

801
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:28,010
Gotta love strippers. So dirty.

802
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:30,128
Show us your tits! Show us your tits!

803
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:33,011
Hey, let's see some titty!

804
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:38,168
- This you?
- Yeah, right here.

805
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:39,845
You did this to yourself.

806
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:47,521
- Small.
- Yeah.

807
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:55,681
It's my wife.

808
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:59,211
Mr. Joyner, it is my legal obligation
to inform you

809
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:02,091
that you are now a part of
a highly classified covert action.

810
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:04,481
So, say hello to your wife
and then get off the phone.

811
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:05,846
Am I clear?

812
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,525
Don't tell my wife shit. Got it.

813
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:09,486
Don't tell your wife shit.

814
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:12,484
- What line?
- Line one.

815
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:16,688
Hey, Mags.
Hey, I can't really talk right now, babe.

816
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:19,684
- I got a lot going on.
- Okay, okay. I get it. You're hungover.

817
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:21,763
Listen, Dr. Dan can see us today at lunch.

818
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,526
- Wait a minute, Dr. Dan?
- The therapist, remember?

819
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:27,968
So, I'm thinking we should just
meet at home and go together. Thank you.

820
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:31,329
Go. Go on,
and I'll just see you there, okay?

821
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:32,606
But I got to really go, babe.

822
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:34,364
I'm slammed in here.
So, I gotta get off the phone.

823
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:37,091
- All right. Jeez! Is everything okay?
- Everything is fine, babe.

824
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:39,641
I gotta keep the line clear.
I love you. Bye, I gotta go.

825
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,161
Love you. Bye.

826
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:43,721
Hmm.

827
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:45,487
"Hmm." What?

828
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:48,450
I'm an expert in speech pathology
and psycho-lingual subtext.

829
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:50,762
Your wife is not fulfilled
in your relationship.

830
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,001
Wait, what?

831
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:53,771
Also, she wants to have a baby.

832
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:55,526
Where are you getting...

833
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:00,725
Calvin Joyner, Accounting.

834
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:05,562
Hello? Calvin Joyner, Accounting.

835
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:07,321
Calvin?

836
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:12,762
It's Bob! It's Bob!

837
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:14,160
Act natural.

838
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:16,448
Calvin. Is that you?

839
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:17,761
Are you there?

840
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:20,687
Well, hey. Well, yeah.

841
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:23,443
Yeah, wassup?

842
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:26,851
What up, Bobby-o?

843
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,207
Are you quite well?

844
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:30,441
I'm in big trouble.

845
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:32,887
Oh, God! I screwed up.
I screwed up big time.

846
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:35,168
We gotta talk. Can you meet me?

847
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:37,527
Sure. Yeah. Where?
Where do you want me to meet you?

848
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:39,250
I'm in the stairwell of your building,
two flights down.

849
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:41,286
- Stairwell?
- Hurry!

850
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:44,768
- He's in the stairwell, two flights down!
- Move, move!

851
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:46,001
Alert Charlie team.

852
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:48,163
Hold on. What's going on? Am I safe here?

853
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:50,089
As long as Bob Stone
is in the building, no one's safe.

854
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:52,169
Get back in your office now!

855
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:57,966
Okay!

856
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:00,208
Good news is we heard her, guys.

857
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:03,370
So, everybody, let's all just stay calm.

858
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:05,966
As long as... As long... Shit!

859
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,968
What the hell is going on?

860
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:12,281
- Relax.
- Hey.

861
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:14,124
Great job at
getting them out of here, Jet.

862
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:15,441
- Oh, Bob!
- That's teamwork!

863
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:17,370
Wait! How did you... What did you just do?

864
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:18,766
It's a tradecraft, buddy.

865
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,286
Spoiler alert...

866
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:21,606
I'm in the CIA.

867
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:22,841
Oh, no shit!

868
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,240
Hey, hey! What're you doing with my phone?

869
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:26,169
You about to turn my phone
into a bomb, aren't you?

870
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:28,528
I've seen Homeland.
So I know what they do.

871
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:31,326
Homeland? No, I'm ordering us an Uber.

872
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:33,323
Six minutes. That's kinda tight.

873
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:35,804
I'm gonna need your tie.

874
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:37,526
You're gonna... No!

875
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:38,886
- Your necktie, take it off.
- No,

876
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:40,605
- I'm not taking my tie off!
- Come on, Jet!

877
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:42,285
Don't do that. Don't do that.

878
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:43,566
That's good. Save it, save it, save it.

879
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:45,085
Save it, Jet.

880
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:47,083
- There we go, just right over here.
- Fine, take it, take it.

881
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:50,005
You can have it. Okay, that...
Listen to me. Listen.

882
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:51,207
Stop. Stop!

883
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:53,362
I need to know
what is happening, right now.

884
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:55,522
Okay, okay. You know what?
Moving too fast.

885
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:58,883
Bottom line, are you in or you out?

886
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:00,886
What are you... In or out of what?

887
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:03,520
Mmm-mmm. No time
for questions, just action.

888
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:05,762
- In or out?
- Okay, then I'm out.

889
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,402
I'm sorry, Jet.
Actually, you're already in.

890
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:10,005
Then why would you ask me?

891
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:11,969
Because I thought
you would go, "I'm in, Bob!"

892
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:14,971
And we would've had a really cool moment,
but you kinda ruined the whole thing.

893
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:16,167
I ruined...

894
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:17,401
Okay, okay, okay.

895
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:18,971
Listen to me right now.

896
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:22,325
Bob, I don't know what it is that
you're into but what I do know is that

897
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:26,371
I am really, really 100% out!

898
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:27,521
Do you understand that?

899
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:29,967
- God, you are good!
- What?

900
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:32,930
Calvin Joyner, president of the Drama Club
for a reason, folks!

901
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:35,811
- You're like a snack-size Denzel.
- Okay. Stop it, stop it, stop it.

902
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,211
This is not a game.

903
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:39,885
I'm being serious right now.

904
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:41,561
I'm out!

905
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:45,326
Okay. Okay.

906
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:47,602
I can't say I'm not disappointed, Jet,

907
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:49,726
but if you're out, you're out.

908
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:51,769
Thank you! I'm out!

909
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:53,888
I'm just happy that we can communicate

910
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:55,690
openly and honestly.

911
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:58,810
I think it says a lot
about our relationship.

912
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:01,327
Wait, hold up, wait.
What're you doing? Oh, my God!

913
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:02,527
Here's the thing, though.

914
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:04,205
There's only one way for you to get out.

915
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:05,486
What's that?

916
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:06,846
You gotta get in first.

917
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:08,371
What is it that...

918
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:09,806
What-what! Take my gun, Jet,

919
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,525
we may have to kill some people.

920
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:13,842
- Come on, it's not gonna bite you.
- I will do no such thing.

921
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,001
I think you'll like it.

922
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:16,491
- I will not!
- You're gonna need it.

923
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:19,920
You're gonna need it! He's in here!

924
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:21,121
Jet.

925
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:23,851
He's in there! Bob's in there!

926
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,287
He's got a gun! He's got a gun!

927
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:30,164
- Down, down, get down!
- Move, move, move!

928
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:32,001
All right. I'm gonna need
your improv skills.

929
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:33,161
What?

930
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:35,806
- Hostage role-play, you ready?
- No!

931
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:37,610
- Sweet, let's go.
- No, I said no!

932
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:38,921
I said no!

933
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:40,525
He's got a hostage!

934
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:42,561
No!

935
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:44,563
No! Stop it, you gonna get me killed!

936
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:47,321
Don't shoot!

937
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:00,961
There we go, Jet!

938
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:02,761
What are you doing?

939
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:04,001
Oh! Shoot!

940
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:06,841
Don't shoot!

941
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:21,001
- Hang tight, Jet!
- No, I'm not doing anything!

942
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:22,690
Stop including me in your stuff!

943
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:26,250
Get him, Agent! Hit him with the stick!

944
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:32,287
Oh!

945
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:34,602
You're doing a great job, Jet.
Just give me a second, okay?

946
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:35,807
What the fuck?

947
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:37,841
He got a coffee pot!

948
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:56,561
He got a banana!

949
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:03,045
Oh! Oh!

950
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:05,246
Freeze!

951
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:18,289
Jet, help!

952
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:19,481
What?

953
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:22,687
Golden Jet, help.

954
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:23,966
No, man, I'm not helping you!

955
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,001
Oh, shit.

956
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:29,846
- Give me the gun!
- Stop it!

957
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,331
- Stop resisting!
- No, let me go!

958
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:37,082
Let me go! I'm trying to give it to you!

959
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:41,406
Oh, shit!

960
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:42,766
- That was an accident!
- Don't move!

961
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:44,206
No, stop! Listen to me!

962
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:47,921
Let's go.

963
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:50,091
Wait, wait! Come on! What are you... Ah!

964
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:52,040
Come on, man!

965
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:54,168
This has gotta stop! Okay?

966
00:44:56,080 --> 00:44:57,127
Shit!

967
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:02,886
Don't shoot!

968
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:05,803
- Oh, God!
- Show us your hands!

969
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:07,405
- Drop your weapon!
- Do it now!

970
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:17,081
Ow.

971
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:18,881
Sorry, Jet.

972
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:21,122
It's over, Bob. Give up.

973
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:22,890
You know I can't do that, Pam.

974
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:24,883
There's nowhere to run, Agent Stone.

975
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:26,726
Just like Caracas.

976
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:31,251
Uh, Caracas would've worked
if you trusted me like Calvin trusts me.

977
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:32,561
No. No.

978
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:34,484
That is not true. I do not trust him!

979
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:36,722
I do not trust him at all.
As a matter of fact,

980
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:38,285
this is a perfect time
for us to clear this up

981
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:40,442
especially in the middle of this standoff.
I shouldn't be here!

982
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:43,171
So I feel like me being
in the middle of this throws me in it.

983
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:44,651
So let me exclude myself.

984
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:46,524
- Hey, stay down!
- Don't move!

985
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:49,371
Okay, all right.
I'll stay in. I'll stay in.

986
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:51,607
I got a plan.

987
00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:55,370
Might get us both killed but if it works,
it'll be a totally boss story.

988
00:45:55,560 --> 00:45:56,561
Cool?

989
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:58,688
- No! No, it's not cool!
- Cool.

990
00:45:58,840 --> 00:46:00,001
No, I said it's not cool.

991
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:01,685
I said it's not cool!

992
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:03,001
Time's up.

993
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:04,841
You're right, Pam.

994
00:46:05,560 --> 00:46:06,641
My time is up.

995
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:08,848
In three, two,

996
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:10,681
one.

997
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:20,408
Bob, Bob, Bob!

998
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:23,406
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

999
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:25,246
Oh, shit!

1000
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,001
Whoo-hoo!

1001
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:45,729
Wow! Did you feel that, Jet?

1002
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:48,121
That was the balls right there!

1003
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:51,446
Hey, did you shit yourself a little bit?

1004
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:55,727
It's all right if you did. Totally cool.
I don't judge.

1005
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:02,201
Get it off!

1006
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:03,681
You guys order an Uber?

1007
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:07,561
What are you doing?

1008
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:09,685
You better get your tuches in the car.

1009
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:10,841
You're gonna get shot!

1010
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:12,161
Don't shoot me! Shoot him!

1011
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:14,846
Shoot him! I'm out! I'm out! I'm out!

1012
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,241
Let me in! Let me in! Let me in! Go, Bob!

1013
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:23,085
Hey, that's my car!

1014
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:24,761
Fuck you!

1015
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:26,969
You get zero stars!

1016
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,207
Put the word out to all assets.

1017
00:47:30,360 --> 00:47:31,930
I'm doubling the price on Bob's head.

1018
00:47:32,360 --> 00:47:33,930
Hey, what the shit, honey...

1019
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:36,885
Get Larry on it.

1020
00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:43,247
Car, car, car!

1021
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:45,609
All right, here's the dilly-o, Jet.

1022
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:47,410
About three weeks ago,
an enemy of the state

1023
00:47:47,560 --> 00:47:48,800
codenamed "The Black Badger"

1024
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:51,930
stole the encryption keys
to the entire US spy satellite program

1025
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:55,124
which he's gonna sell to a buyer from that
auction site on your computer last night.

1026
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:56,327
Bob...

1027
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:57,561
If we lose control of our satellites,

1028
00:47:57,720 --> 00:48:00,530
we're completely vulnerable
to any terrorist attacks.

1029
00:48:00,680 --> 00:48:02,603
That's why I had to go back
to your office and get you, Jet.

1030
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:04,524
I need your super sweet accounting skills

1031
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:06,603
to help me figure out
the last piece of this puzzle

1032
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:09,001
which is the transaction number
from the winning bid.

1033
00:48:09,160 --> 00:48:11,049
That'll tell us
where the deal is going down.

1034
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:15,048
That way, we can get The Black Badger.

1035
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:16,401
I can't do it without you, Jet.

1036
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:19,127
Are you kidding me? I'm not helping you.

1037
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:21,044
You attacked somebody with a banana.

1038
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:23,931
- A banana, force multiplier.
- What?

1039
00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:26,162
Well, basically what that means
is anything in your hand

1040
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:30,161
is far more dangerous than just your
bare hands alone, including a banana.

1041
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:31,801
Oh!

1042
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:35,008
Oh! Ah!

1043
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:36,850
- A force multiplier!
- Yeah.

1044
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,490
Yeah, that's what it is.

1045
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:40,682
It makes so much more sense to me now.

1046
00:48:40,840 --> 00:48:43,047
That's page-one CIA stuff.

1047
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:46,602
I almost forgot
that I wasn't in the fucking CIA!

1048
00:48:47,560 --> 00:48:48,686
Stop the car.

1049
00:48:48,840 --> 00:48:50,729
You stop the car right now! Stop the car!

1050
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:52,769
Okay, okay. That's a great idea, Jet.

1051
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:54,570
We should get off the grid right now.

1052
00:48:55,880 --> 00:48:57,689
Whoa!

1053
00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:04,682
All right. We're clear.

1054
00:49:10,520 --> 00:49:11,681
Okay.

1055
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:14,362
Okay. Let's just take some deep breaths.

1056
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:16,045
Okay? Deep breaths.

1057
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:19,566
All you gotta do is get out of this car

1058
00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:23,291
and have a rational conversation
with Bob and he'll understand.

1059
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:34,884
Robert, I would like to
go home now, please.

1060
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:36,724
Buddy, you and me both.

1061
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:39,121
But until we clear our names,
there's no going home.

1062
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:41,487
I'm sorry, can you clarify
that last sentence for me?

1063
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:42,926
Yeah, well, now that you're in...

1064
00:49:43,120 --> 00:49:45,248
Let me stop you right there. I'm not in.

1065
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:47,084
I never said that I was in.

1066
00:49:47,240 --> 00:49:50,005
In fact, I expressly remember
saying that I was out!

1067
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:51,241
I know, but they think you're in.

1068
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:52,801
I am...

1069
00:49:53,320 --> 00:49:55,243
I'm fucking out! I'm out!

1070
00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:56,401
- What's left to tell?
- Hey, no, I get it.

1071
00:49:56,560 --> 00:49:58,244
- I'm not in!
- I'm just saying they think you're in.

1072
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:01,370
- I'm not in! I am not in!
- I get it.

1073
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:03,602
I'm not in! I'm out!

1074
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:06,240
One sec, Jet, just gotta disable the GPS.

1075
00:50:06,680 --> 00:50:07,681
Where did you...

1076
00:50:08,120 --> 00:50:09,451
You wanna go under... That's fine!

1077
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:10,807
Wait a minute.

1078
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:11,961
You did this on purpose, didn't you?

1079
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:15,647
This whole thing was done on purpose.

1080
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:17,370
This is your plan!

1081
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:19,249
You tricked me!

1082
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:21,687
It's fine, but I know you tricked me.

1083
00:50:21,840 --> 00:50:23,285
- Trick you?
- You tricked... Hey, boy!

1084
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:25,568
What? What'd you just...

1085
00:50:25,720 --> 00:50:26,801
I didn't trick you,
you offered to help me.

1086
00:50:27,320 --> 00:50:28,845
You know what's funny? Harris told me.

1087
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:30,451
She told me everything, man.

1088
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:32,170
She told me that you stole the codes.

1089
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:34,129
Let me tell you something about Harris.
You can't trust her.

1090
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:36,487
She's already trying to frame me
for my partner's murder!

1091
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:38,604
- You killed your partner?
- No.

1092
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:39,801
I would never do that.

1093
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:41,485
The Black Badger killed my partner.

1094
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:43,569
Let me explain to you something, dude.
This is what happened.

1095
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:47,121
After The Black Badger
stole the satellite encryption codes,

1096
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:50,887
my partner Phil and I
tracked him to a penthouse in Kiev.

1097
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:52,166
- Hey, Phil.
- Yeah.

1098
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:54,006
I'll see you on the other side.

1099
00:50:55,320 --> 00:50:56,810
See you on the other side.

1100
00:50:58,120 --> 00:50:59,645
All right.

1101
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:01,325
God, I love that guy.

1102
00:51:01,480 --> 00:51:02,845
He knew we were coming, so he set a trap.

1103
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,048
Hey, Bob! Bob!

1104
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:06,281
No!

1105
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:08,966
Phil was my partner, my teammate

1106
00:51:09,720 --> 00:51:11,484
- and I couldn't save him.
- No!

1107
00:51:14,320 --> 00:51:15,890
It was awful, Cal.

1108
00:51:16,040 --> 00:51:17,485
It was a setup, right from the get-go.

1109
00:51:19,080 --> 00:51:20,127
Damn, man.

1110
00:51:20,680 --> 00:51:21,841
The Black Badger was never there.

1111
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,287
I should've been the one
on that elevator, not Phil.

1112
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:25,807
God.

1113
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,367
Okay. Bob, please...

1114
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:30,801
I'm begging you, man.
Can you just let me go home?

1115
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:32,485
CJ, I totally understand.

1116
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:34,449
But right now,
Agent Harris and her taskforce

1117
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:36,329
has that place surveilled up the yin-yang.

1118
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:38,050
She's got contract killers looking for us.

1119
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:39,480
Your place isn't safe.

1120
00:51:39,640 --> 00:51:41,324
Oh, my God. Maggie.

1121
00:51:41,480 --> 00:51:43,687
Maggie! What the hell
am I supposed to do about Maggie?

1122
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:47,366
Get down, Jet!

1123
00:51:56,600 --> 00:51:58,045
Shit! Oh!

1124
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:00,001
Look out, Bob!

1125
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,571
Who the hell is that? Who is that? Bob?

1126
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:15,960
Oh, shit.

1127
00:52:21,240 --> 00:52:22,241
Larry.

1128
00:52:25,320 --> 00:52:26,606
Thought you retired.

1129
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:27,761
I did.

1130
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:30,448
But you're worth a lot of money,
Bob, dead or alive.

1131
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:33,160
Well, tough luck,
because I've got back up.

1132
00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:34,401
Ain't that right, Jet?

1133
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:38,281
Jet!

1134
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:03,001
Hey, baby. I know. I'm sorry I'm late.

1135
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:05,282
The stupid Koplin deposition ran long.

1136
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:07,442
I'm leaving right now.
I'll meet you at the house.

1137
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:08,806
No, no, no! Don't go home!

1138
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:10,610
- Don't go home!
- Why? What's going on?

1139
00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:13,525
Nothing! Nothing.
I'm just running late, too.

1140
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:16,126
So I was gonna say
let's just meet at Dr. Dan's office.

1141
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:19,328
Yeah. Okay. Is everything all right?

1142
00:53:19,480 --> 00:53:21,801
Yeah! Yeah. Why?

1143
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:23,200
Everything's fine.

1144
00:53:23,360 --> 00:53:25,522
Because you kind of sound
like Ray Liotta at the end of Goodfellas.

1145
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:27,086
What?

1146
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:30,368
That's so funny, babe.
That's such a good reference.

1147
00:53:30,560 --> 00:53:32,324
That's classic Mags right there.

1148
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:35,285
So, okay. So you're not
gonna go home, right?

1149
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:36,720
Okay, fine. I won't go home.

1150
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:38,245
I'll meet you at Dr. Dan's. See you soon.

1151
00:53:38,440 --> 00:53:39,566
Okay. All right, bye.

1152
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:40,767
All right, bye.

1153
00:54:03,880 --> 00:54:04,881
Get in.

1154
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:25,961
I'm gonna address
the elephant in the room.

1155
00:54:26,120 --> 00:54:29,442
Okay, first of all, you...

1156
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:32,444
You guys, I want to say sorry to.

1157
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:36,161
Because what you're probably thinking
is not what happened.

1158
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:37,367
Accidents!

1159
00:54:37,720 --> 00:54:38,767
I know you're like,

1160
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:41,441
"How can you accidentally pistol-whip
somebody and shoot somebody?"

1161
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:42,601
It can happen.

1162
00:54:42,760 --> 00:54:46,446
Okay? Today is proof
that it can happen. So...

1163
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:48,443
I'm glad I got to get that off my chest.

1164
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:50,689
Relax, Mr. Joyner. I believe you.

1165
00:54:50,840 --> 00:54:52,729
Okay, thank you.

1166
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:55,451
Trust me, I know a
scared-shitless civilian when I see one.

1167
00:54:55,640 --> 00:54:56,880
You don't have to convince me.

1168
00:54:57,040 --> 00:54:59,805
You got him over here. That is me.

1169
00:54:59,960 --> 00:55:01,803
Right now, I'm not comfortable.

1170
00:55:01,960 --> 00:55:03,689
Okay, I am scared, okay?

1171
00:55:03,840 --> 00:55:06,207
I don't have no shit in my system.

1172
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:08,368
If I sat down on a toilet,
nothing's coming out.

1173
00:55:08,520 --> 00:55:09,681
Farts or just air.

1174
00:55:16,320 --> 00:55:17,560
It'd sound like lasers.

1175
00:55:17,720 --> 00:55:19,165
Thank you for that description.

1176
00:55:19,720 --> 00:55:21,484
Mr. Joyner, let me explain something.

1177
00:55:21,640 --> 00:55:22,926
Bob's last forced psych eval

1178
00:55:23,080 --> 00:55:26,004
show a person rapidly losing
his grip on reality.

1179
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:27,685
Bob became obsessed with a ghost,

1180
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:29,366
a figment of his imagination,

1181
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:31,170
he started calling "The Black Badger."

1182
00:55:31,320 --> 00:55:33,322
This obsession led to an instability,

1183
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:36,165
first reported by his partner, Phil,
three weeks ago.

1184
00:55:36,320 --> 00:55:38,846
Just before Phil was killed in the field.

1185
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:40,206
Do you know how Phil died?

1186
00:55:40,360 --> 00:55:43,170
Yeah, Bob told me that
The Black Badger killed him.

1187
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:48,447
What?

1188
00:55:49,360 --> 00:55:50,361
What?

1189
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:54,286
Mr. Joyner, Bob Stone is The Black Badger.

1190
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:57,406
Phil was Bob's partner of six years.

1191
00:55:57,560 --> 00:55:58,561
His best friend.

1192
00:55:58,760 --> 00:56:01,047
- See you on the other side.
- See you on the other side.

1193
00:56:02,040 --> 00:56:03,530
Hey, Bob!

1194
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:05,967
After he stole
the satellite encryption codes

1195
00:56:06,120 --> 00:56:07,281
Bob betrayed Phil.

1196
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:08,441
No!

1197
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:11,885
He killed him to cover his tracks.

1198
00:56:15,880 --> 00:56:18,963
And, after that, Bob went rogue.

1199
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:20,929
This is all that's left of Phil.

1200
00:56:24,520 --> 00:56:27,205
Um, this is PornHub.

1201
00:56:27,960 --> 00:56:30,884
Oh, shit, shit, shit. Sorry.

1202
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:32,721
There you go.

1203
00:56:33,360 --> 00:56:36,648
Oh! Oh, God! Oh, I didn't see that coming.

1204
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:38,526
Oh, man!

1205
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,162
- It's a hell of a way to go.
- Okay, wait a minute.

1206
00:56:42,320 --> 00:56:44,641
Why wouldn't Bob just go sell
the satellite encryption codes himself?

1207
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:46,609
Because in a black market
blind-bidding situation,

1208
00:56:46,760 --> 00:56:48,410
the buyer and the seller,
they don't know each other.

1209
00:56:48,560 --> 00:56:50,961
They need the auction site
to tell them exactly where to meet up

1210
00:56:51,120 --> 00:56:52,246
and when to make the exchange.

1211
00:56:52,840 --> 00:56:55,923
The transaction number
from the auction site gives them that,

1212
00:56:56,080 --> 00:56:58,082
which means Bob still needs you.

1213
00:56:59,080 --> 00:57:02,561
Which is why we find ourselves
in a little catch-and-release scenario.

1214
00:57:02,760 --> 00:57:04,808
You are the only one Bob trusts.

1215
00:57:05,600 --> 00:57:07,011
That's why we're putting you in the field.

1216
00:57:07,160 --> 00:57:09,049
The next time you're with Bob,

1217
00:57:10,080 --> 00:57:11,764
press this button.

1218
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:13,285
We're going to have him cold.

1219
00:57:19,560 --> 00:57:21,369
Now, go take care of your marriage.

1220
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:24,444
One more thing. Don't tell your wife shit.

1221
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:26,931
All right.

1222
00:57:28,840 --> 00:57:30,001
I just don't know what's wrong.

1223
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:33,928
I mean, the man that I married,
the person I knew in high school,

1224
00:57:34,080 --> 00:57:38,210
he was filled
with drive and desire. I mean...

1225
00:57:38,360 --> 00:57:41,285
We used to sneak off every lunch hour
and make out under the gym bleachers.

1226
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:43,408
Like, that guy, back then,

1227
00:57:43,600 --> 00:57:45,762
- he wanted things, you know?
- Hmm.

1228
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:48,207
Hey, I'm sorry I'm late.
I couldn't find parking.

1229
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:50,164
Hi, no, no, it's okay.
We got started without you.

1230
00:57:50,360 --> 00:57:52,203
Babe, Calvin, this is Dr. Dan.

1231
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:53,721
Hello, Calvin.

1232
00:57:53,880 --> 00:57:56,008
- Oh, shit!
- Oh, jeez. What's the matter?

1233
00:57:56,200 --> 00:57:58,441
- Holy shit! Get behind me!
- Honey... Calvin, what?

1234
00:57:58,600 --> 00:58:00,887
It's okay, Maggie. It's okay. Just relax.

1235
00:58:01,080 --> 00:58:03,367
This is a very common reaction
in the therapeutic process.

1236
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:04,521
- It is?
- What?

1237
00:58:04,680 --> 00:58:05,681
It is. It absolutely is.

1238
00:58:05,840 --> 00:58:08,969
Calvin, this is a very safe place.
Please, sit down.

1239
00:58:09,120 --> 00:58:10,929
- This is not a safe place!
- No, no, no. Honey, it's a...

1240
00:58:11,080 --> 00:58:12,570
No, this is most definitely
not a safe place!

1241
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:14,529
Me and my wife are leaving. Let's go.

1242
00:58:14,680 --> 00:58:16,682
No, no, no! You are going to sit down,

1243
00:58:16,840 --> 00:58:19,810
and we are going to go through
this therapeutic process...

1244
00:58:19,960 --> 00:58:21,849
- Yes.
- ...together, as a couple.

1245
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:24,243
Um... Fine, fine, fine.

1246
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:25,890
Sit down. Thank you.

1247
00:58:26,040 --> 00:58:27,087
Fine.

1248
00:58:27,240 --> 00:58:31,006
Okay, guys. Why don't we start off
with a little bit of word association?

1249
00:58:31,160 --> 00:58:32,207
Okay.

1250
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:33,401
This is exciting.

1251
00:58:33,560 --> 00:58:35,528
I've heard this can
really open a couple up.

1252
00:58:36,280 --> 00:58:39,648
Uh, Maggie, I'm going to offer you a word,

1253
00:58:39,800 --> 00:58:43,691
and you respond
however you're moved to from here.

1254
00:58:43,840 --> 00:58:44,887
Okay.

1255
00:58:45,080 --> 00:58:46,320
- Black.
- White.

1256
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:47,970
- Water.
- Ocean.

1257
00:58:48,120 --> 00:58:50,361
- Sunshine.
- Happy.

1258
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,480
- I'm very impressed, Maggie.
- Really?

1259
00:58:53,640 --> 00:58:54,926
You're very in tune.

1260
00:58:55,480 --> 00:58:56,891
I'm very in tune.

1261
00:58:57,040 --> 00:58:59,122
Calvin, you're next.

1262
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:00,964
I do not want to do this.

1263
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:03,806
Relax, Calvin. There are no wrong answers.

1264
00:59:03,960 --> 00:59:04,961
Up.

1265
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:07,687
Down.

1266
00:59:08,280 --> 00:59:09,281
Mmm.

1267
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:11,406
"Mmm." What is that?

1268
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:12,647
What're you writing in your book?

1269
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:14,131
- It's fine. Don't freak out.
- Nobody's freaking out.

1270
00:59:14,320 --> 00:59:15,970
I just don't understand
the rules to the game.

1271
00:59:16,120 --> 00:59:17,326
Freaking out.

1272
00:59:18,280 --> 00:59:20,203
Let's switch gears for a second, okay?

1273
00:59:21,640 --> 00:59:23,324
Maggie, during lovemaking,

1274
00:59:24,920 --> 00:59:28,003
have you ever placed anything
inside of Calvin's anus?

1275
00:59:28,160 --> 00:59:29,491
What the hell did you just say?

1276
00:59:29,640 --> 00:59:31,529
Well, yeah, there was this one time.

1277
00:59:31,680 --> 00:59:33,887
- You remember? Game of Thrones finale.
- What are you talking about?

1278
00:59:34,040 --> 00:59:36,088
I was Khaleesi, you were Littlefinger...

1279
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:38,891
- Okay, all right, stop. That's enough.
- Please, please, please.

1280
00:59:39,240 --> 00:59:42,528
Why don't we try a simple
role-playing exercise?

1281
00:59:42,720 --> 00:59:44,529
Calvin, you be Calvin

1282
00:59:44,720 --> 00:59:47,121
and I will become Maggie.

1283
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:48,805
Mmm.

1284
00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:50,851
I'm confused.

1285
00:59:55,520 --> 00:59:57,204
It's called "soul gazing."

1286
00:59:57,400 --> 01:00:01,007
Stare into my soul
and I'll stare into yours.

1287
01:00:01,720 --> 01:00:03,609
- Maggie, this...
- Hey. Shh.

1288
01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:05,842
There's no talking, and don't look away.

1289
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:07,365
Stare into my soul.

1290
01:00:07,880 --> 01:00:09,006
You are not my...

1291
01:00:09,160 --> 01:00:10,207
Shh. There's no talking.

1292
01:00:10,680 --> 01:00:12,250
Babe, I'm not staring...

1293
01:00:12,680 --> 01:00:15,684
Me and you. Stay with me. I'm your wife.

1294
01:00:15,880 --> 01:00:17,530
You are not my wife.

1295
01:00:20,040 --> 01:00:21,405
How could you hit your wife?

1296
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:23,240
How can I... How can I what?

1297
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:25,004
- You hit your wife!
- No...

1298
01:00:25,160 --> 01:00:26,161
- He hit me!
- Okay.

1299
01:00:26,320 --> 01:00:27,321
- He hit you!
- Okay.

1300
01:00:27,480 --> 01:00:28,766
You hit us!

1301
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:35,084
- I'm swaddling you.
- I know what you're doing.

1302
01:00:35,240 --> 01:00:36,651
- I'm swaddling you.
- I know what you're...

1303
01:00:36,800 --> 01:00:37,801
Come here.

1304
01:00:38,360 --> 01:00:39,521
Oh, my God!

1305
01:00:39,960 --> 01:00:40,961
You...

1306
01:00:42,080 --> 01:00:44,526
You know what? We're leaving! Let's go!

1307
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:46,650
This is not real.

1308
01:00:46,800 --> 01:00:48,370
It's real to me.

1309
01:00:48,520 --> 01:00:49,726
You know what, Calvin?

1310
01:00:49,880 --> 01:00:52,042
If you can't commit
to working on our marriage,

1311
01:00:52,200 --> 01:00:53,804
then you need to let me know.

1312
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:55,331
Maggie, you...

1313
01:00:57,600 --> 01:00:59,250
- What!
- Oh, my God!

1314
01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:00,526
You're... Something's not right.

1315
01:01:00,760 --> 01:01:03,730
Come on, Jet, listen.
Come on, come on, Jet!

1316
01:01:03,880 --> 01:01:05,848
Now, I know things got
a little rough there at the end.

1317
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,241
But the truth is, with all the heat
that you have coming down on you,

1318
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:10,323
Maggie is definitely safer without you.

1319
01:01:11,400 --> 01:01:13,687
And, trust me,
when this whole thing is said and done

1320
01:01:13,840 --> 01:01:15,410
and you basically
save the entire free world,

1321
01:01:15,560 --> 01:01:17,961
she's going to forgive you.
It'll all work itself out.

1322
01:01:18,120 --> 01:01:19,565
It'll all work itself out?

1323
01:01:20,360 --> 01:01:22,283
Okay, Bob, you know,
I'm sick of playing games with you.

1324
01:01:22,440 --> 01:01:23,851
Where's the real Dr. Dan?

1325
01:01:24,600 --> 01:01:25,681
What-what?

1326
01:01:25,840 --> 01:01:28,764
Oh, my... Dr. Dan,
I had nothing to do with this.

1327
01:01:28,920 --> 01:01:30,251
He's fine. I'll get you some water
in a little bit.

1328
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:32,641
- Thanks, doc.
- You know...

1329
01:01:32,880 --> 01:01:34,803
That's it. That is it.

1330
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:36,650
That is it.

1331
01:01:38,040 --> 01:01:39,087
All right, Jet.

1332
01:01:39,240 --> 01:01:41,242
I see that Harris has given you
a button to push.

1333
01:01:42,200 --> 01:01:44,806
Relax, I would've taken the same deal,
too, if I was in your shoes.

1334
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:47,281
Otherwise, she wouldn't
let you out of her sight, right?

1335
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:48,885
It makes perfect sense.

1336
01:01:50,080 --> 01:01:51,764
But you're not going to
press the button, right?

1337
01:01:53,120 --> 01:01:55,168
You got the top-secret satellite codes?

1338
01:01:55,720 --> 01:01:56,960
Yes or no?

1339
01:01:57,120 --> 01:01:58,929
This ain't the time to bullshit me.

1340
01:01:59,080 --> 01:02:00,809
Okay, my ass is sweating.

1341
01:02:00,960 --> 01:02:02,200
I'm nervous. Don't bullshit me!

1342
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:04,482
Of course not, dude. Hey, hey, come on!

1343
01:02:04,640 --> 01:02:05,971
Of course I don't have the codes.

1344
01:02:06,120 --> 01:02:07,610
Why would I go through
all this trouble, then?

1345
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:10,001
I need your skill set, Jet, to help me get

1346
01:02:10,200 --> 01:02:12,282
the bank transaction numbers
to the winning bid.

1347
01:02:12,440 --> 01:02:14,124
We already know it's going down tonight

1348
01:02:14,280 --> 01:02:15,645
from the countdown on your computer.

1349
01:02:15,800 --> 01:02:17,290
Now, all we need is the "where."

1350
01:02:17,720 --> 01:02:19,927
And the bank transaction numbers
will give us the "where."

1351
01:02:20,080 --> 01:02:21,286
That's why I need you.

1352
01:02:21,440 --> 01:02:22,805
Your job gives you access to

1353
01:02:22,960 --> 01:02:24,689
exactly that kind of information.

1354
01:02:24,880 --> 01:02:26,962
Then we can get The Badger,
we can get the buyer

1355
01:02:27,120 --> 01:02:28,201
in one fell swoop.

1356
01:02:28,360 --> 01:02:30,089
And it'll all be over tonight.

1357
01:02:30,280 --> 01:02:31,486
Please, I swear.

1358
01:02:31,680 --> 01:02:33,125
You gotta believe me.

1359
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,082
Can't you just get us
the transaction number?

1360
01:02:45,480 --> 01:02:47,767
Not when the money
originates from an offshore account.

1361
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:51,287
When that happens, then only a certified
international banking official can access it.

1362
01:02:51,440 --> 01:02:53,522
But, it shouldn't be a problem.
We just give this guy

1363
01:02:53,680 --> 01:02:55,444
the offshore account numbers
that you gave me,

1364
01:02:55,600 --> 01:02:57,090
then he can give us the transaction number

1365
01:02:57,240 --> 01:02:59,402
without knowing that
he's committing treason when he does it.

1366
01:02:59,560 --> 01:03:00,766
Sound familiar?

1367
01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:03,008
Ouch! Low blow, CJ.

1368
01:03:03,160 --> 01:03:05,083
Hey, besides,
it's only treason if we're wrong.

1369
01:03:05,240 --> 01:03:06,571
Who's this mystery man?

1370
01:03:07,960 --> 01:03:08,961
It's Trevor.

1371
01:03:13,680 --> 01:03:14,806
Trevor.

1372
01:03:17,600 --> 01:03:19,170
This week just keeps getting better.

1373
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:24,328
You know, I mean, Robbie Wheirdicht and
Calvin "The Golden Jet" Joyner in my office.

1374
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:26,448
Who would've thunk it? Not me.

1375
01:03:26,600 --> 01:03:28,443
This is great, huh?

1376
01:03:28,600 --> 01:03:30,602
Talk about caterpillar to the butterfly...

1377
01:03:30,760 --> 01:03:32,683
What is this? P90X?

1378
01:03:32,840 --> 01:03:35,730
More like "P1,000,000X," huh?

1379
01:03:35,880 --> 01:03:37,450
Congratulations.

1380
01:03:37,880 --> 01:03:39,370
Hey, I, um...

1381
01:03:39,520 --> 01:03:40,965
I really appreciate the help, Trevor.

1382
01:03:41,120 --> 01:03:43,361
My client's all on me
to get this stuff handled right away.

1383
01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:44,681
So, you know, if we could...

1384
01:03:44,880 --> 01:03:46,803
Say no more.
It's my pleasure. I've been there.

1385
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:48,450
These international accounts
can be very, very tricky

1386
01:03:48,600 --> 01:03:49,647
if you don't have the right clearances.

1387
01:03:49,840 --> 01:03:51,604
You can get a bunch of digital red tape.

1388
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:53,968
I'm happy to help, you know?

1389
01:03:54,120 --> 01:03:55,167
Robbie.

1390
01:03:55,320 --> 01:03:57,129
You're such a blast from the past, buddy.

1391
01:03:57,280 --> 01:03:58,281
How long has it been since I saw you?

1392
01:03:58,440 --> 01:03:59,487
Was it high school?

1393
01:04:02,480 --> 01:04:03,481
What's that?

1394
01:04:03,640 --> 01:04:06,086
Um... How we doing
with those account access codes?

1395
01:04:06,240 --> 01:04:07,287
- Are they coming?
- It's coming.

1396
01:04:07,440 --> 01:04:08,680
- Everything's good?
- It's coming.

1397
01:04:08,840 --> 01:04:11,286
I'm going as fast as I can. I know
you guys are in a rush. I'm so sorry.

1398
01:04:11,440 --> 01:04:13,488
Anything for a couple of fellow Centaurs.

1399
01:04:13,640 --> 01:04:16,405
Speaking of which, you guys are going
to the reunion tonight, right?

1400
01:04:18,440 --> 01:04:20,169
No, I don't think so.

1401
01:04:20,320 --> 01:04:21,481
You're both going.

1402
01:04:21,640 --> 01:04:23,369
Here it is.
Here's your transaction number.

1403
01:04:23,520 --> 01:04:25,124
You're both going
because you want to know what?

1404
01:04:25,280 --> 01:04:26,520
Stinky Pete's going to be there.

1405
01:04:26,680 --> 01:04:29,604
And Jimmy Longballs called me.
He's going to be hanging.

1406
01:04:30,360 --> 01:04:33,284
Carlos Nagasaki, the Mexican eggroll.
He's going to be there.

1407
01:04:33,800 --> 01:04:35,802
You guys will be missing out on a big one.

1408
01:04:35,960 --> 01:04:37,121
Plus you know what they're going to do?

1409
01:04:37,280 --> 01:04:39,282
They're going to vote on
homecoming king and queen again.

1410
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:41,044
Maybe you and Maggie
can make it two for two.

1411
01:04:41,360 --> 01:04:43,522
Now, before you go,
stay seated one second.

1412
01:04:43,680 --> 01:04:45,364
Give me two minutes, sit down.

1413
01:04:46,040 --> 01:04:47,644
Men,

1414
01:04:48,160 --> 01:04:49,491
a few years ago...

1415
01:04:50,680 --> 01:04:52,648
I found the Lord Almighty.

1416
01:04:52,800 --> 01:04:53,801
And, ever since then,

1417
01:04:53,960 --> 01:04:56,804
my life has been
completely different. Okay?

1418
01:04:56,960 --> 01:04:59,327
He's got a plan for
each and every one of us

1419
01:04:59,480 --> 01:05:01,369
and, in his infinite wisdom,

1420
01:05:01,520 --> 01:05:03,761
he makes no mistakes. Hmm?

1421
01:05:04,320 --> 01:05:05,651
You're right about that.

1422
01:05:05,800 --> 01:05:08,525
I think the Lord put you here because he
wants me to get something off my chest.

1423
01:05:08,680 --> 01:05:11,685
He wants me to clear my conscience
and he wants me to ask for forgiveness.

1424
01:05:11,880 --> 01:05:12,881
Robert.

1425
01:05:13,080 --> 01:05:17,165
What I did to you at that rally
in senior year was a cowardly act.

1426
01:05:17,320 --> 01:05:19,687
It's something that
I've regretted every single day.

1427
01:05:19,840 --> 01:05:22,844
Yeah. I mean,
bullying is a national crisis.

1428
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:27,369
It can leave people
with a lifetime of pain.

1429
01:05:27,520 --> 01:05:30,967
And I just have no excuse
for what I did to you.

1430
01:05:31,120 --> 01:05:33,407
I mean, I did grow up in a house
with a father who was physical,

1431
01:05:33,560 --> 01:05:35,881
but that doesn't give me
the right to take it out on somebody

1432
01:05:36,040 --> 01:05:38,520
who at the time
was weaker, you know? So...

1433
01:05:38,880 --> 01:05:42,009
Calvin, with this particular
transgression,

1434
01:05:42,160 --> 01:05:45,687
I not only embarrassed him
but I also ruined your final speech.

1435
01:05:45,840 --> 01:05:47,490
- No, no.
- Yes, I did.

1436
01:05:47,640 --> 01:05:49,961
- It's okay. No, it's okay.
- No, really, I stole your thunder.

1437
01:05:50,120 --> 01:05:52,521
And it's another thing that
I've had to live with every single day.

1438
01:05:52,680 --> 01:05:57,404
And I work through it in individual therapy
as well as group, and I pray about it.

1439
01:05:59,200 --> 01:06:00,326
So...

1440
01:06:03,720 --> 01:06:07,930
I just want to say how truly sorry I am

1441
01:06:08,080 --> 01:06:10,606
for what happened, you know.

1442
01:06:10,760 --> 01:06:12,205
Or for what I did.

1443
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:13,686
It didn't just happen. I did it.

1444
01:06:13,840 --> 01:06:16,571
I did it, and I wish to God
that I had not done it.

1445
01:06:17,080 --> 01:06:20,209
So, I'm hoping that
you can find it in your heart

1446
01:06:21,400 --> 01:06:23,289
to forgive me.

1447
01:06:25,080 --> 01:06:27,208
I wasn't expecting this at all.

1448
01:06:27,360 --> 01:06:29,044
Don't I know it. I know it.

1449
01:06:30,240 --> 01:06:31,730
I'm just so happy.

1450
01:06:32,840 --> 01:06:34,410
I don't know what to say.

1451
01:06:35,160 --> 01:06:36,764
How about you say...

1452
01:06:38,240 --> 01:06:42,211
"The Oscar goes to Trevor Olson."

1453
01:06:45,640 --> 01:06:47,244
What do you mean?

1454
01:06:55,400 --> 01:06:56,686
Weird Dick!

1455
01:06:56,840 --> 01:06:58,444
You stupid ass!

1456
01:06:58,600 --> 01:07:00,284
Good God, you're dumb!

1457
01:07:00,440 --> 01:07:02,363
Dumber than ever, I guess!

1458
01:07:02,520 --> 01:07:04,284
And you, too, Calvin!

1459
01:07:04,440 --> 01:07:07,091
Look at that stupid look
on those two faces.

1460
01:07:07,240 --> 01:07:10,084
"The Lord taught me to care."
Unbelievable.

1461
01:07:10,240 --> 01:07:13,528
I'm a Scientologist. Okay, that's "A."

1462
01:07:13,680 --> 01:07:15,967
And thetan-free since 2003.

1463
01:07:16,120 --> 01:07:17,121
Clear as shit.

1464
01:07:17,280 --> 01:07:18,520
And "I'm sorry for what I did"?

1465
01:07:18,720 --> 01:07:19,926
Let me tell you what I'm sorry about.

1466
01:07:20,080 --> 01:07:22,447
I'm sorry I didn't toss your naked ass
out there three more times.

1467
01:07:22,640 --> 01:07:23,971
It was the best senior prank ever.

1468
01:07:24,120 --> 01:07:25,610
I still get emails about it.

1469
01:07:25,840 --> 01:07:27,683
And if I'd had
one of these bad boys back then,

1470
01:07:27,840 --> 01:07:29,171
I would have shot it, uploaded it,

1471
01:07:29,320 --> 01:07:31,766
and it would have gone crazy viral,
a zillion hits.

1472
01:07:31,920 --> 01:07:32,967
Know what?

1473
01:07:33,120 --> 01:07:34,724
You're going to regret
you ever opened your mouth.

1474
01:07:34,880 --> 01:07:37,281
- You hear me, Trevor?
- Yeah? How come, Calvin?

1475
01:07:37,440 --> 01:07:38,930
Because he's about to
whoop your ass, that's why.

1476
01:07:39,080 --> 01:07:40,081
Who is?

1477
01:07:40,280 --> 01:07:41,327
Bob, get up and whoop his ass.

1478
01:07:41,480 --> 01:07:43,562
Here she comes!
Let me tell you something...

1479
01:07:43,720 --> 01:07:46,610
Weird Dick can't chug a bunch
of fucking steroids and elk urine

1480
01:07:46,760 --> 01:07:48,649
and suddenly be able to kick my ass.

1481
01:07:48,800 --> 01:07:50,802
Fuck that! It ain't gonna happen.

1482
01:07:51,160 --> 01:07:52,446
'Cause here's why.

1483
01:07:53,840 --> 01:07:57,367
Once a fat kid, always a fat kid.

1484
01:07:57,880 --> 01:07:59,006
Huh? Prove me wrong.

1485
01:07:59,160 --> 01:08:00,730
Bob, come on. Do what you did in the bar.

1486
01:08:11,640 --> 01:08:13,722
Come on, hit me!

1487
01:08:13,880 --> 01:08:16,167
And I'll sue your ass,
and take your fanny pack away.

1488
01:08:18,280 --> 01:08:19,725
You got to make poopies?

1489
01:08:20,080 --> 01:08:21,081
What's wrong, Bob?

1490
01:08:21,280 --> 01:08:22,327
We got a john here.

1491
01:08:22,840 --> 01:08:24,683
Or you got to change your rag?

1492
01:08:25,400 --> 01:08:26,401
Maybe that's it.

1493
01:08:26,760 --> 01:08:28,524
Jenny, you got an extra rag?

1494
01:08:29,720 --> 01:08:31,722
- What's the matter with you?
- I just want to go.

1495
01:08:31,880 --> 01:08:33,166
She wants to go.

1496
01:08:33,880 --> 01:08:35,882
Go ahead. There you go.

1497
01:08:36,480 --> 01:08:37,561
No, it's a push.

1498
01:08:37,720 --> 01:08:39,927
Boy, 50-50 shot. You missed that.

1499
01:08:40,080 --> 01:08:41,411
At least you found the handle.

1500
01:08:41,560 --> 01:08:44,040
Boy, he's still a scared little bitch.

1501
01:08:44,200 --> 01:08:45,531
You know, you're still an asshole.

1502
01:08:45,720 --> 01:08:47,768
Yeah, well, you're still
shorter than my cat.

1503
01:08:48,560 --> 01:08:49,721
Here's your transaction number.

1504
01:08:50,080 --> 01:08:51,570
Hit it, dick licker.

1505
01:08:53,200 --> 01:08:55,168
- Thank you, Trevor.
- Yup.

1506
01:08:56,120 --> 01:08:57,849
Glad to see you haven't changed a bit.

1507
01:08:58,000 --> 01:08:59,001
Bye-bye now.

1508
01:08:59,160 --> 01:09:00,446
- Was it push or pull?
- Clean push.

1509
01:09:00,600 --> 01:09:02,125
- Which one is it?
- You want me to do it for you?

1510
01:09:02,320 --> 01:09:03,321
Which one is it?

1511
01:09:04,560 --> 01:09:07,131
Hey, hey, hey! Goddamn it, Joyner!

1512
01:09:07,280 --> 01:09:08,441
Jenny!

1513
01:09:08,600 --> 01:09:11,490
Jenny, get the Windex!
And security for this one.

1514
01:09:11,640 --> 01:09:13,927
Get your asshole off my door! That's it!

1515
01:09:15,480 --> 01:09:17,369
Bob! Bob!

1516
01:09:17,680 --> 01:09:19,523
Bob! Bob! Bob!

1517
01:09:26,640 --> 01:09:28,847
Mr. Joyner. Guess who
we're about to arrest

1518
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:30,968
for conspiracy to commit treason.

1519
01:09:33,720 --> 01:09:36,200
That's right. Your lovely wife.

1520
01:09:36,400 --> 01:09:38,164
So, here's what you're going to do.

1521
01:09:38,360 --> 01:09:40,886
You're going to tell us
exactly where you and Bob are.

1522
01:09:41,040 --> 01:09:44,567
Then you're going to go outside and you're
going to keep Bob on-site until we arrive.

1523
01:09:44,800 --> 01:09:47,007
And if he leaves, you lose.

1524
01:09:47,760 --> 01:09:49,330
Is that clear?

1525
01:09:54,840 --> 01:09:55,841
Oh, hey.

1526
01:09:56,040 --> 01:09:58,601
I don't know what happened
in there, and I just froze up.

1527
01:09:58,760 --> 01:10:00,444
I locked up. I'm sorry.

1528
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:02,047
Look, Bob, I...

1529
01:10:02,200 --> 01:10:04,567
No, I gotta tell you something,
CJ, listen.

1530
01:10:04,760 --> 01:10:06,569
You're the only one
who's ever been nice to me,

1531
01:10:06,760 --> 01:10:08,649
the only one who's never laughed at me.

1532
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:11,929
And you're the only one
in this whole world that I trust.

1533
01:10:12,080 --> 01:10:17,647
And I know you have a lot
of friends, but I don't.

1534
01:10:19,440 --> 01:10:20,805
You're my only friend, Calvin.

1535
01:10:21,480 --> 01:10:24,086
And I will never
let you down again, I promise.

1536
01:10:25,840 --> 01:10:27,410
I'm sorry, man.

1537
01:10:31,080 --> 01:10:32,206
Sorry for what?

1538
01:10:32,360 --> 01:10:34,044
I told Harris where we are.

1539
01:10:35,080 --> 01:10:36,650
They were going to hurt Maggie.

1540
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:38,768
I had to. I didn't have a choice.

1541
01:10:39,280 --> 01:10:40,406
I'm sorry.

1542
01:10:45,480 --> 01:10:47,403
Freeze, Bob! Hands on your head!

1543
01:10:47,560 --> 01:10:48,561
Do it now!

1544
01:11:19,120 --> 01:11:22,325
I know you know how this goes,
so I'll spare you the dramatics.

1545
01:11:22,480 --> 01:11:24,562
I'll ask you just once.

1546
01:11:24,720 --> 01:11:26,961
Where are the satellite encryption codes?

1547
01:11:29,080 --> 01:11:31,128
Aw. What's the matter, Bob?

1548
01:11:31,840 --> 01:11:35,003
Are you upset that
your friend turned you in?

1549
01:11:35,560 --> 01:11:37,210
I don't have any friends.

1550
01:11:37,360 --> 01:11:39,044
Okay, I don't want to watch this, guys.

1551
01:11:39,200 --> 01:11:40,611
Don't worry, it'll be over quick.

1552
01:11:40,760 --> 01:11:42,330
She always gets them to break.

1553
01:11:42,520 --> 01:11:44,887
Okay. You have it your way.

1554
01:11:45,040 --> 01:11:46,644
We're going to do this old-school.

1555
01:11:54,680 --> 01:11:56,603
Get the extraction tools.

1556
01:11:58,360 --> 01:12:00,328
The extraction tools?

1557
01:12:00,680 --> 01:12:02,648
If you don't have the stomach for it,
you can go.

1558
01:12:03,440 --> 01:12:04,930
Come on.

1559
01:12:07,560 --> 01:12:08,607
Stop recording.

1560
01:12:18,800 --> 01:12:20,802
Why am I coming here?
I was told I'd be able to leave.

1561
01:12:20,960 --> 01:12:22,041
You can leave,

1562
01:12:22,200 --> 01:12:24,881
when Agent Harris says you can leave,
which might be never.

1563
01:12:25,080 --> 01:12:26,445
I gotta watch this.

1564
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:36,325
I'm sorry, Bob.

1565
01:12:36,800 --> 01:12:38,086
I'm sorry, man.

1566
01:12:51,280 --> 01:12:52,406
Oh, Jesus!

1567
01:13:00,240 --> 01:13:01,241
What the hell?

1568
01:13:02,800 --> 01:13:04,484
Hey! Hey!

1569
01:13:06,040 --> 01:13:07,041
Don't move!

1570
01:13:07,200 --> 01:13:09,646
You get your hands off!
Get them off the keyboard!

1571
01:13:09,800 --> 01:13:11,768
- What are you doing, Calvin?
- Give me your keycard!

1572
01:13:12,080 --> 01:13:13,605
Give me your keycard!

1573
01:13:14,200 --> 01:13:15,201
Give it to me.

1574
01:13:15,640 --> 01:13:16,687
- Okay...
- Go sit down.

1575
01:13:16,840 --> 01:13:18,444
Okay. Yeah.

1576
01:13:18,600 --> 01:13:19,931
Sorry. I'm sorry.

1577
01:13:20,120 --> 01:13:22,122
- Sit down! Sit down!
- Okay, okay, okay.

1578
01:13:24,360 --> 01:13:25,361
You know, Bob?

1579
01:13:25,520 --> 01:13:28,171
This is actually
my favorite part of the job.

1580
01:13:28,320 --> 01:13:30,561
Thank you for being so uncooperative.

1581
01:13:30,720 --> 01:13:33,771
What do you think your little buddy, Joyner,
would say if he could see you like this?

1582
01:13:34,120 --> 01:13:35,121
Two words.

1583
01:13:35,280 --> 01:13:36,327
I'm in.

1584
01:13:37,320 --> 01:13:39,163
What-what?

1585
01:13:39,480 --> 01:13:41,847
You're making a big mistake, Mr. Joyner.

1586
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:43,968
That's only if I'm wrong.

1587
01:13:45,800 --> 01:13:47,325
Come on, Bob. Let's go!

1588
01:13:47,520 --> 01:13:49,363
What're you doing? Come on, man!

1589
01:13:50,800 --> 01:13:53,007
Okay, listen to me. Bob, I'm sorry.

1590
01:13:53,160 --> 01:13:55,128
I'm sorry I double-crossed you.
You hear me?

1591
01:13:55,320 --> 01:13:57,368
I should've believed you,
I should've trusted you, and I didn't.

1592
01:13:57,520 --> 01:13:58,521
I'm sorry for that.

1593
01:13:58,680 --> 01:14:01,251
Listen to me. Bob,
we don't have time for this, man!

1594
01:14:01,400 --> 01:14:03,528
I need you to tap into
that super-spy stuff

1595
01:14:03,680 --> 01:14:06,604
and I need you to get us the hell
out of here right now. Do you hear me?

1596
01:14:06,840 --> 01:14:08,604
I'm not a super spy, Calvin.

1597
01:14:09,680 --> 01:14:11,808
I'm Robbie Wheirdicht, super tool.

1598
01:14:11,960 --> 01:14:14,042
No, stop. You're not a super tool.

1599
01:14:14,200 --> 01:14:16,601
You're not even Robbie Wheirdicht.
You're Bob Stone!

1600
01:14:17,200 --> 01:14:18,884
- I made that name up.
- So what?

1601
01:14:19,040 --> 01:14:21,281
- It's not real.
- What does that mean? What does that mean?

1602
01:14:21,440 --> 01:14:25,206
You think Mr. T and Sting
were born with those names?

1603
01:14:26,920 --> 01:14:28,763
How do you think I got
the name "Golden Jet" at high school?

1604
01:14:28,920 --> 01:14:31,844
- 'Cause you're awesome.
- No, that's not how.

1605
01:14:32,720 --> 01:14:35,371
In the eighth grade, I ran track.
It was my first race.

1606
01:14:35,520 --> 01:14:38,410
Okay, the race came down
to me and this other kid.

1607
01:14:38,560 --> 01:14:40,050
I wanted to win the race so damn bad

1608
01:14:40,240 --> 01:14:42,402
that I ended up peeing in my pants
at the finish line.

1609
01:14:42,640 --> 01:14:44,404
That's how I got the name "Golden Jet."

1610
01:14:45,120 --> 01:14:48,044
So, take it from a guy who's literally
pissed his pants in front of everybody

1611
01:14:48,200 --> 01:14:49,565
just to win a race.

1612
01:14:49,800 --> 01:14:51,723
You are who you decide to be.

1613
01:14:52,240 --> 01:14:55,005
And you chose to be
an international CIA spy.

1614
01:14:55,360 --> 01:14:57,283
Come on, man.
You get to kill people for a living.

1615
01:14:57,760 --> 01:14:58,761
How cool is that?

1616
01:15:00,920 --> 01:15:03,127
I don't know.

1617
01:15:03,400 --> 01:15:04,401
Kinda cool I guess.

1618
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,128
What do you mean "kinda cool"?
Ain't no kinda cool.

1619
01:15:07,480 --> 01:15:09,448
Stop it! It's awesome.

1620
01:15:09,760 --> 01:15:11,091
Now, come on, man. We boys?

1621
01:15:12,760 --> 01:15:13,761
- We're boys.
- Oh!

1622
01:15:15,440 --> 01:15:16,441
Sorry, Jet.

1623
01:15:16,920 --> 01:15:18,604
Oh, God!

1624
01:15:19,520 --> 01:15:20,521
Oh, God!

1625
01:15:20,920 --> 01:15:22,524
See? Good as new.

1626
01:15:23,800 --> 01:15:25,643
Wow. Sorry, man.

1627
01:15:29,560 --> 01:15:30,607
Go, go!

1628
01:15:31,120 --> 01:15:32,167
Get me out!

1629
01:15:32,320 --> 01:15:34,209
He got the jump on us. Give me the key.

1630
01:15:37,600 --> 01:15:38,647
Look out, Bob!

1631
01:15:39,760 --> 01:15:41,888
Here, Jet! Get him!

1632
01:15:42,040 --> 01:15:43,451
Watch out!

1633
01:15:52,120 --> 01:15:53,485
Did you see that, Bob?

1634
01:15:53,640 --> 01:15:55,722
I did the thing! I did the thing, Bob!

1635
01:15:55,880 --> 01:15:56,881
Yeah!

1636
01:15:57,040 --> 01:15:58,963
Yeah! Yeah!

1637
01:15:59,240 --> 01:16:00,605
- Come on! Follow me!
- Let's do it!

1638
01:16:00,760 --> 01:16:03,331
No! What the fuck am I doing?
Here! You get the gun.

1639
01:16:03,480 --> 01:16:05,130
- I'm behind you. Go.
- All right.

1640
01:16:09,680 --> 01:16:11,523
Oh, my God. There's two of them.

1641
01:16:11,680 --> 01:16:14,126
Yeah, I'll distract them
and you open the door, okay?

1642
01:16:14,280 --> 01:16:15,691
- What? No!
- Let's roll.

1643
01:16:15,880 --> 01:16:16,927
No, no.

1644
01:16:18,880 --> 01:16:20,166
Go, go!

1645
01:16:20,880 --> 01:16:23,042
- Close in!
- Moving out!

1646
01:16:23,200 --> 01:16:25,123
- Freeze, Bob!
- Sorry about this, guys.

1647
01:16:28,280 --> 01:16:29,850
Nope, come here.

1648
01:16:39,920 --> 01:16:41,206
Come on.

1649
01:16:41,360 --> 01:16:43,601
Wrong keycard, pal. Turn around.

1650
01:16:45,680 --> 01:16:46,841
You needed this one.

1651
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:48,240
On the ground, now.

1652
01:16:48,400 --> 01:16:49,686
Can I say something first?

1653
01:16:49,840 --> 01:16:51,410
- What?
- This is going to hurt.

1654
01:16:54,280 --> 01:16:56,442
- Hey, get the keycard! Let's roll.
- All right, all right.

1655
01:16:59,200 --> 01:17:00,486
Which car are we taking?

1656
01:17:02,520 --> 01:17:03,567
Not that one.

1657
01:17:03,760 --> 01:17:05,364
Oh, my God.

1658
01:17:05,920 --> 01:17:07,729
Oh, God. Oh, sh...

1659
01:17:08,640 --> 01:17:09,641
Oh.

1660
01:17:09,960 --> 01:17:11,166
Here we go, Jet.

1661
01:17:13,280 --> 01:17:15,726
- Bob, they are shooting at us!
- It's okay, it's bulletproof.

1662
01:17:15,880 --> 01:17:16,881
Drive, drive!

1663
01:17:28,760 --> 01:17:29,966
Here you go, Jet.

1664
01:17:30,680 --> 01:17:31,681
What's this?

1665
01:17:31,840 --> 01:17:33,888
Bug-out bag, courtesy of the CIA.

1666
01:17:34,080 --> 01:17:35,411
Go ahead and grab that
encrypted phone in there.

1667
01:17:35,560 --> 01:17:36,561
For what?

1668
01:17:36,720 --> 01:17:38,370
You still have the bank transaction code?

1669
01:17:38,520 --> 01:17:41,444
How are transaction numbers gonna help us
find out where the bad guys are?

1670
01:17:41,600 --> 01:17:44,126
Well, it's not bank transaction
numbers or codes, it's actually...

1671
01:17:44,280 --> 01:17:45,805
Longitude and latitude.

1672
01:17:47,200 --> 01:17:50,921
Look at the spy brain
on the Jet! What-what!

1673
01:17:51,240 --> 01:17:53,481
You're like a chocolate Google.

1674
01:17:53,640 --> 01:17:55,688
Bob, don't do that. Stop it. Stop it.

1675
01:17:55,840 --> 01:17:56,921
You're getting good at this, man.

1676
01:17:57,080 --> 01:17:58,923
Yeah, you're absolutely right.
It's longitude and latitude.

1677
01:17:59,080 --> 01:18:02,527
All you gotta do is plug those
digits into the GPS, and boom!

1678
01:18:02,720 --> 01:18:05,291
We're gonna catch the buyer
and The Badger, just like that.

1679
01:18:07,440 --> 01:18:09,124
Boston.

1680
01:18:12,640 --> 01:18:14,324
We're gonna need a plane.

1681
01:18:27,720 --> 01:18:29,006
You ever steal a plane before?

1682
01:18:29,160 --> 01:18:31,447
- I stole some Starbursts one time.
- Mmm-hmm.

1683
01:18:31,880 --> 01:18:33,962
So I don't know
if that compares or anything,

1684
01:18:34,120 --> 01:18:35,565
but I wasn't successful with that.

1685
01:18:35,720 --> 01:18:36,846
On the way out, I dropped 'em.

1686
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:38,206
Dropped the whole bag. The guy caught me.

1687
01:18:38,400 --> 01:18:40,004
"What's that?" I just said, "A Starburst."

1688
01:18:40,160 --> 01:18:42,162
Told him myself. It was a mess.

1689
01:18:44,960 --> 01:18:47,406
Check it out. The universe provides.

1690
01:18:49,920 --> 01:18:50,921
Oh.

1691
01:18:52,880 --> 01:18:53,881
Golden Jet.

1692
01:18:54,120 --> 01:18:55,531
- Golden Jet.
- Golden Jet.

1693
01:18:59,440 --> 01:19:01,329
- It's just one guard in there.
- All right.

1694
01:19:01,480 --> 01:19:03,130
90% of spy work is distraction.

1695
01:19:03,280 --> 01:19:05,561
You get in there and distract that guard,
I'm gonna get us a plane.

1696
01:19:06,280 --> 01:19:07,327
What?

1697
01:19:09,160 --> 01:19:10,650
I don't know what the hell you expect...

1698
01:19:13,080 --> 01:19:14,081
Bob!

1699
01:19:14,880 --> 01:19:15,881
Bob!

1700
01:19:16,520 --> 01:19:17,567
Fuck!

1701
01:19:18,160 --> 01:19:19,241
Fuck you, Bob!

1702
01:19:20,640 --> 01:19:21,641
Damn it!

1703
01:19:29,720 --> 01:19:32,041
Hey, I need a plane.

1704
01:19:32,240 --> 01:19:35,164
Sir, you cannot be in here.
This is a private airfield.

1705
01:19:35,320 --> 01:19:37,846
I understand that but I have an organ
in this cooler right now

1706
01:19:38,040 --> 01:19:40,042
that needs to get transported ASAP.

1707
01:19:40,720 --> 01:19:41,721
Really?

1708
01:19:41,920 --> 01:19:44,924
Because my sister-in-law
had a heart transplant last year

1709
01:19:45,080 --> 01:19:47,924
and they did not bring it
in a Playmate lunch cooler.

1710
01:19:48,080 --> 01:19:49,889
I hate to break it to you,

1711
01:19:50,040 --> 01:19:51,769
but this is not a...

1712
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:54,081
- This is not a heart.
- It's not a heart?

1713
01:19:55,360 --> 01:19:56,407
No, it's not.

1714
01:19:56,600 --> 01:19:57,806
Hmm. What is it then?

1715
01:19:58,880 --> 01:20:01,042
- It's a dick.
- Okay.

1716
01:20:02,600 --> 01:20:04,489
I am made of questions right now.

1717
01:20:04,640 --> 01:20:05,926
Well, you don't have to ask.

1718
01:20:06,080 --> 01:20:07,889
Last night, lady got into it with a man.

1719
01:20:08,040 --> 01:20:09,724
She ended up cutting his pecker off.

1720
01:20:09,880 --> 01:20:11,769
She left with it, got in a car, drove,

1721
01:20:11,920 --> 01:20:13,888
got on 95, threw it out the window.

1722
01:20:14,240 --> 01:20:17,084
The second largest penis hunt
in the state history.

1723
01:20:17,240 --> 01:20:20,006
The man was Korean, so you better
believe it took a long time to find.

1724
01:20:20,600 --> 01:20:22,489
You're stereotyping Korean dicks.

1725
01:20:22,640 --> 01:20:23,721
That's racist.

1726
01:20:23,920 --> 01:20:25,649
I've seen Korean dicks bigger than you.

1727
01:20:25,840 --> 01:20:28,366
Okay, after finding it,
the guy brought it to me,

1728
01:20:28,520 --> 01:20:31,364
and he said, "Do your due diligence in
getting this dick where it's got to go."

1729
01:20:31,520 --> 01:20:32,806
That's what I do.

1730
01:20:32,960 --> 01:20:35,281
I'm a dick deliverer specialist.

1731
01:20:35,720 --> 01:20:36,721
Oh, DDS?

1732
01:20:36,960 --> 01:20:38,564
Like a dentist but for dicks.

1733
01:20:39,320 --> 01:20:40,321
Uh...

1734
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:43,810
So, people are like,
"Here's a dick. Find a plane."

1735
01:20:44,640 --> 01:20:46,722
That's how you do it?
You're like an Uber for dicks?

1736
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:48,684
Where do you get these jobs?
On Craigslist?

1737
01:20:48,840 --> 01:20:50,763
Okay, sir, we don't need
to demean each other here.

1738
01:20:50,920 --> 01:20:52,285
I don't believe a word you're saying.

1739
01:20:52,920 --> 01:20:54,206
Let me see it.

1740
01:20:54,800 --> 01:20:56,564
I have no problem showing you this.

1741
01:20:56,720 --> 01:20:59,166
So if you wanna see it
then get ready to see.

1742
01:20:59,520 --> 01:21:01,443
- Here I go.
- Go for it.

1743
01:21:02,760 --> 01:21:05,604
Oh, shit! Oh, shit.

1744
01:21:05,760 --> 01:21:08,206
I'm just kidding. This is my friend.

1745
01:21:08,560 --> 01:21:10,244
- Oh!
- It's my buddy.

1746
01:21:10,480 --> 01:21:12,289
His name's Snake Gyllenhaal.

1747
01:21:12,480 --> 01:21:14,482
- He guards my lunch.
- Okay, that's enough.

1748
01:21:38,200 --> 01:21:39,611
It's gotta be Harris, right?

1749
01:21:40,880 --> 01:21:41,927
What do you mean?

1750
01:21:42,120 --> 01:21:43,645
I mean, she's gotta be The Black Badger.

1751
01:21:43,800 --> 01:21:44,961
It's the only thing that makes sense.

1752
01:21:45,120 --> 01:21:46,884
I mean, she's had access
to the encryption codes

1753
01:21:47,040 --> 01:21:49,691
and she's so hot and bothered about
pinning this whole thing on you.

1754
01:21:49,880 --> 01:21:50,961
It's gotta be her!

1755
01:21:51,120 --> 01:21:52,645
I don't know, Jet.

1756
01:21:52,840 --> 01:21:54,729
I'm pretty sure she thinks
I'm The Black Badger.

1757
01:21:54,880 --> 01:21:56,928
She worked me over pretty good
in that interrogation room.

1758
01:21:57,080 --> 01:21:59,162
Hold on, wait, wait... What's going on?

1759
01:21:59,520 --> 01:22:01,966
What's that?
What's going on right now, Bob?

1760
01:22:02,120 --> 01:22:04,282
No biggie. We're completely outta gas.

1761
01:22:04,480 --> 01:22:05,970
Oh, my... Oh!

1762
01:22:07,920 --> 01:22:10,207
We're going down, Jet!
There's nothing I can do!

1763
01:22:10,400 --> 01:22:13,006
- Oh, shit!
- Really quickly...

1764
01:22:13,160 --> 01:22:16,767
What's the one thing
you wish you'd done in your life?

1765
01:22:16,920 --> 01:22:19,287
The one thing I wish I hadn't done
is not get in a plane with a guy

1766
01:22:19,440 --> 01:22:21,363
who didn't check the goddamned fuel!

1767
01:22:21,520 --> 01:22:24,490
- Why wouldn't you check the fuel?
- No, something that's real.

1768
01:22:24,640 --> 01:22:27,086
What's the one thing
you regret not doing for you?

1769
01:22:27,240 --> 01:22:29,402
Oh, my God! I think we're gonna die!

1770
01:22:34,120 --> 01:22:36,088
Not having a kid, man!

1771
01:22:36,600 --> 01:22:37,806
Not being a father!

1772
01:22:37,960 --> 01:22:40,327
I regret not being a father!

1773
01:22:40,480 --> 01:22:42,369
Maggie, I should've gave you a kid!

1774
01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:45,006
I should've gave you my seed, Maggie!

1775
01:22:45,160 --> 01:22:46,571
I should've!

1776
01:22:46,720 --> 01:22:48,085
I'm so selfish!

1777
01:22:49,480 --> 01:22:51,482
I'm sorry, Maggie!

1778
01:22:55,640 --> 01:22:57,927
- That wasn't so hard, right?
- What?

1779
01:22:58,080 --> 01:22:59,809
Hey, just for the record,

1780
01:22:59,960 --> 01:23:01,644
I think you'd make a great dad.

1781
01:23:02,280 --> 01:23:04,089
Did you just fake this whole thing?

1782
01:23:04,760 --> 01:23:05,761
Yeah, kinda.

1783
01:23:05,920 --> 01:23:07,570
You gotta be shitting me glory!

1784
01:23:07,720 --> 01:23:09,210
No, not at all.

1785
01:23:09,360 --> 01:23:11,442
I just thought that maybe a
facing-your-own-death situation

1786
01:23:11,600 --> 01:23:14,683
might help motivate you
to clarify some of your goals in life.

1787
01:23:14,880 --> 01:23:16,405
And, hey, between me and you,

1788
01:23:16,880 --> 01:23:18,564
I know you've been struggling
a little bit.

1789
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:21,207
You know what I'm struggling with
right now, Bob?

1790
01:23:21,360 --> 01:23:22,850
Not whooping your ass.

1791
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:25,082
Okay, Jet.
Hey, you're really cute when you cry.

1792
01:23:25,240 --> 01:23:27,163
Stop it! Enough!

1793
01:23:40,800 --> 01:23:42,006
I don't get it.

1794
01:23:42,200 --> 01:23:45,482
I mean, if these coordinates are correct,
we should be standing right on top of it.

1795
01:23:45,640 --> 01:23:48,530
The deal doesn't go down
for another 30 minutes, Jet,

1796
01:23:48,680 --> 01:23:51,206
- so we're kinda early.
- No!

1797
01:23:51,360 --> 01:23:52,725
Why would you do it
out in the open like this?

1798
01:23:52,920 --> 01:23:54,445
Why would you take that risk?

1799
01:23:54,600 --> 01:23:56,284
Just doesn't make any sense, man.

1800
01:23:57,600 --> 01:23:59,284
Shit! Come on.

1801
01:24:01,320 --> 01:24:02,367
Wait.

1802
01:24:04,040 --> 01:24:05,929
Oh, wait. It's not happening up here.

1803
01:24:07,720 --> 01:24:09,131
No, it's not. It's...

1804
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,571
Oh, it's happening beneath us. Look.

1805
01:24:14,720 --> 01:24:16,609
It's an underground parking garage.

1806
01:24:17,520 --> 01:24:18,965
Yeah, that's a good eye, Jet.

1807
01:24:19,480 --> 01:24:21,721
Why don't you stay up here?
Keep overwatch.

1808
01:24:21,880 --> 01:24:23,370
I'll go down there and check things out.

1809
01:24:23,520 --> 01:24:25,363
Wait, what? No, I'm going with you.

1810
01:24:25,520 --> 01:24:28,285
You can't go with me.
The smarter play is if we split up.

1811
01:24:28,440 --> 01:24:29,646
Smarter play for who?

1812
01:24:30,080 --> 01:24:31,730
Do you know what happens
when people split up, Bob?

1813
01:24:31,920 --> 01:24:32,967
Somebody dies!

1814
01:24:33,120 --> 01:24:34,531
I'd be the one to die. You know why?

1815
01:24:34,680 --> 01:24:37,081
Because I don't have a bulletproof vest
and I don't have a gun!

1816
01:24:37,240 --> 01:24:38,890
Which means that you
are my bulletproof vest!

1817
01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:41,441
My little black ass is gonna stay
behind you, you're not leaving me!

1818
01:24:41,600 --> 01:24:43,489
That's exactly why
you should stay up here.

1819
01:24:43,680 --> 01:24:46,001
Look, if you went down
in that garage and you got shot to death,

1820
01:24:46,160 --> 01:24:47,321
you know how hurt I would be?

1821
01:24:47,480 --> 01:24:49,130
I'd be super bummed out!
I don't want that.

1822
01:24:49,280 --> 01:24:50,884
It's safer for you up here.

1823
01:24:51,040 --> 01:24:52,929
If something happened up here,
what am I supposed to do, Bob?

1824
01:24:53,080 --> 01:24:55,208
How do I get your attention?
Make a bird call?

1825
01:24:57,520 --> 01:24:59,602
Does that sound like a bird to you? Huh?

1826
01:24:59,760 --> 01:25:01,649
That's my biggest weakness!
I can't make bird noises.

1827
01:25:01,800 --> 01:25:02,847
I never could.

1828
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:04,764
So if that's what
I gotta depend on to live,

1829
01:25:04,920 --> 01:25:07,764
it means I'm gonna die!
I'mma die up here, by myself

1830
01:25:07,920 --> 01:25:10,241
sounding like a dead-ass pigeon.

1831
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,606
- I have no idea what a pigeon...
- Jet, Jet, Jet, Jet, Jet!

1832
01:25:14,760 --> 01:25:16,444
You don't have to make bird noises.

1833
01:25:16,600 --> 01:25:17,601
You don't have to sound like a pigeon.

1834
01:25:17,760 --> 01:25:22,609
All you gotta do is call me on
the encrypted phone that's in your hand.

1835
01:25:27,200 --> 01:25:28,565
- Okay?
- Okay, yeah.

1836
01:25:29,040 --> 01:25:30,405
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

1837
01:25:30,600 --> 01:25:31,761
All right?

1838
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:33,206
Oh, Jet.

1839
01:25:34,720 --> 01:25:36,404
I'll see you on the other side.

1840
01:25:37,240 --> 01:25:38,241
Yeah.

1841
01:25:38,560 --> 01:25:39,561
Yeah.

1842
01:26:05,720 --> 01:26:06,801
You're early.

1843
01:26:07,480 --> 01:26:09,084
So are you.

1844
01:26:11,720 --> 01:26:13,085
Come on.

1845
01:26:23,760 --> 01:26:25,091
Oh, my God!

1846
01:26:28,920 --> 01:26:30,809
Oh, my God.

1847
01:26:31,640 --> 01:26:32,641
I knew it.

1848
01:26:32,800 --> 01:26:35,167
I knew it. I knew
she was The Black Badger!

1849
01:26:35,320 --> 01:26:36,970
Oh, my God!

1850
01:26:37,480 --> 01:26:39,608
Pick up the phone. Pick up the phone.

1851
01:26:39,760 --> 01:26:40,761
Yello?

1852
01:26:40,960 --> 01:26:43,566
Bob, Harris is The Black Badger!

1853
01:26:43,760 --> 01:26:44,761
Hello?

1854
01:26:45,120 --> 01:26:46,531
Harris is The Black Badger!

1855
01:26:46,720 --> 01:26:47,767
I can't hear you.

1856
01:26:47,920 --> 01:26:49,763
Harris is The Black Badger!

1857
01:26:51,120 --> 01:26:53,646
Just kidding! I'm not here.
Leave a message at the beep.

1858
01:26:53,800 --> 01:26:54,801
What?

1859
01:27:05,120 --> 01:27:06,645
Oh. Harris is The Black Badger!

1860
01:27:06,800 --> 01:27:08,450
Harris is The Black Badger!

1861
01:27:08,600 --> 01:27:10,921
I knew it. I knew it.
Harris is The Black Badger!

1862
01:27:12,120 --> 01:27:14,248
Bob! Harris is The...

1863
01:27:15,720 --> 01:27:16,721
Who is he?

1864
01:27:17,160 --> 01:27:18,161
That's my partner.

1865
01:27:32,040 --> 01:27:33,610
I don't like splitting my fees.

1866
01:27:35,280 --> 01:27:38,443
The package. Please.

1867
01:27:39,600 --> 01:27:41,250
Thought you'd never ask.

1868
01:27:41,480 --> 01:27:44,882
Wait! You're making a mistake.

1869
01:27:46,440 --> 01:27:48,124
Hello, Bob.

1870
01:27:49,800 --> 01:27:51,404
But you're dead.

1871
01:27:51,560 --> 01:27:53,608
Not as much as people think.

1872
01:27:54,360 --> 01:27:57,125
Look, he's not The Black Badger...

1873
01:27:57,800 --> 01:27:58,801
I am.

1874
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:01,128
And those aren't the encryption codes,

1875
01:28:01,280 --> 01:28:02,611
these are.

1876
01:28:02,760 --> 01:28:03,886
He's lying to you.

1877
01:28:04,040 --> 01:28:05,530
This man is a CIA agent,

1878
01:28:05,880 --> 01:28:07,370
and he's trying to sell you bogus plans.

1879
01:28:14,720 --> 01:28:15,767
Damn.

1880
01:28:17,720 --> 01:28:19,051
Ow, ow.

1881
01:28:22,640 --> 01:28:23,721
He shot me.

1882
01:28:27,640 --> 01:28:29,802
These are the real codes

1883
01:28:30,640 --> 01:28:32,244
and I am the real Black Badger.

1884
01:28:36,360 --> 01:28:37,850
Bob is The Black Badger.

1885
01:28:39,520 --> 01:28:40,681
Bob is The Black Badger.

1886
01:28:40,840 --> 01:28:42,922
I am The Black Badger.

1887
01:28:43,400 --> 01:28:44,606
Phil?

1888
01:28:45,840 --> 01:28:48,411
No, I'm The Black Badger.

1889
01:28:48,560 --> 01:28:51,564
I'm starting to think
I might be The Black Badger.

1890
01:28:53,800 --> 01:28:55,450
Here's the thing.

1891
01:28:55,640 --> 01:28:58,723
I have no idea
who is the real Black Badger.

1892
01:28:59,760 --> 01:29:01,285
And I don't care.

1893
01:29:01,480 --> 01:29:02,970
'Cause I'm The Honey Badger.

1894
01:29:03,120 --> 01:29:05,043
And The Honey Badger doesn't give a shit.

1895
01:29:05,200 --> 01:29:06,804
The Honey Badger's nasty.

1896
01:29:06,960 --> 01:29:09,645
He's so nasty, he'll take them both.

1897
01:29:10,160 --> 01:29:11,161
Hand them over.

1898
01:29:11,720 --> 01:29:13,927
Phil, when this thing is over,

1899
01:29:14,080 --> 01:29:18,130
I'm going to rip your throat out
like Patrick Swayze in Road House.

1900
01:29:18,280 --> 01:29:19,645
Oh, my God. You and Road House.

1901
01:29:19,800 --> 01:29:20,847
Get over that movie.

1902
01:29:21,040 --> 01:29:22,769
It sucked then, it sucks now.

1903
01:29:23,280 --> 01:29:24,611
Fuck Patrick Swayze!

1904
01:29:25,600 --> 01:29:26,726
How dare you!

1905
01:29:32,040 --> 01:29:33,451
Drop your weapons!

1906
01:29:39,200 --> 01:29:40,247
Oh! Oh, shit!

1907
01:29:52,560 --> 01:29:53,721
The codes.

1908
01:29:54,120 --> 01:29:55,246
Don't do it.

1909
01:29:55,880 --> 01:29:56,961
Stupid.

1910
01:29:59,400 --> 01:30:00,401
Okay.

1911
01:30:00,960 --> 01:30:02,007
One,

1912
01:30:03,040 --> 01:30:04,041
two,

1913
01:30:05,400 --> 01:30:06,401
three! Shit!

1914
01:30:11,720 --> 01:30:13,404
Uh-oh! Oh!

1915
01:30:13,920 --> 01:30:14,921
No!

1916
01:30:15,400 --> 01:30:16,526
He's got the codes!

1917
01:30:51,520 --> 01:30:52,521
Whoo!

1918
01:30:52,960 --> 01:30:54,610
I mean, this is crazy, right?

1919
01:30:54,960 --> 01:30:56,121
You stay the hell away from me, Bob!

1920
01:30:56,280 --> 01:30:57,566
You shot me in the neck!

1921
01:31:00,600 --> 01:31:01,601
Jet!

1922
01:31:22,880 --> 01:31:23,927
Okay.

1923
01:31:28,320 --> 01:31:30,482
Golden Jet for the win!

1924
01:31:32,120 --> 01:31:33,645
No. Shit!

1925
01:31:33,840 --> 01:31:35,205
Drop your weapon, Bob.

1926
01:31:36,400 --> 01:31:37,401
Oh, shit!

1927
01:31:37,560 --> 01:31:39,130
Get behind me, Mr. Joyner.

1928
01:31:39,560 --> 01:31:40,925
Ah, you don't wanna do that, Jet.

1929
01:31:41,160 --> 01:31:42,446
It's obvious he's the bad guy.

1930
01:31:42,640 --> 01:31:44,085
I'm the good guy. You wanna get behind me.

1931
01:31:44,240 --> 01:31:46,083
Agent Harris had me go dark

1932
01:31:46,240 --> 01:31:49,323
to get Bob to reveal himself
as The Black Badger.

1933
01:31:49,520 --> 01:31:51,124
You don't seriously
believe this guy, do you?

1934
01:31:51,280 --> 01:31:52,441
You wanna get behind me, Jet.

1935
01:31:52,600 --> 01:31:54,329
You betrayed your nation, Bob.

1936
01:31:54,680 --> 01:31:57,001
You betrayed your partner, Phil.

1937
01:31:57,160 --> 01:32:00,528
Okay, no, wait! Everybody just stop!

1938
01:32:00,680 --> 01:32:01,727
Cut the shit!

1939
01:32:02,280 --> 01:32:03,930
I'mma cut the line right now!

1940
01:32:04,120 --> 01:32:05,485
I cut the shit!

1941
01:32:05,640 --> 01:32:07,529
Hear me? Now I don't care
who betrayed who.

1942
01:32:07,680 --> 01:32:09,125
Okay? I just don't wanna get hurt!

1943
01:32:09,560 --> 01:32:12,086
So there ain't gonna be no... Shit!

1944
01:32:20,960 --> 01:32:21,961
Come on.

1945
01:32:37,840 --> 01:32:38,841
Shi...

1946
01:32:43,520 --> 01:32:44,521
Shit.

1947
01:33:03,240 --> 01:33:05,322
Smart move, Mr. Joyner.

1948
01:33:05,480 --> 01:33:07,767
You've done your country a great service.

1949
01:33:07,920 --> 01:33:10,127
Now, hand me the firearm

1950
01:33:10,280 --> 01:33:13,523
and we'll turn over
the satellite codes together.

1951
01:33:13,920 --> 01:33:17,527
Stay right there, man.
Don't you take another step.

1952
01:33:17,760 --> 01:33:20,081
Just because I shot him
does not mean I trust you.

1953
01:33:20,480 --> 01:33:21,641
We don't have time for this.

1954
01:33:21,840 --> 01:33:24,605
Stop! I said, "Stop."

1955
01:33:25,360 --> 01:33:27,124
Aw, whoopsie.

1956
01:33:31,320 --> 01:33:33,368
Nice throw, bitch.

1957
01:33:38,080 --> 01:33:42,608
You wanna know why your pal Bob
could never have been The Black Badger?

1958
01:33:43,760 --> 01:33:45,888
It's because he's too weak.

1959
01:33:46,040 --> 01:33:48,361
And if I had to hear
another goddamned story

1960
01:33:48,520 --> 01:33:51,729
about Calvin "The Golden Jet" Joyner

1961
01:33:51,880 --> 01:33:54,042
and how awesome you were in high school

1962
01:33:54,200 --> 01:33:56,806
and how you were
this big idiot's best friend,

1963
01:33:56,960 --> 01:33:58,485
I was just gonna lose it.

1964
01:33:59,760 --> 01:34:03,082
Looking at you right now,
you don't seem so cool.

1965
01:34:03,280 --> 01:34:06,727
You just seem like a regular guy.

1966
01:34:07,160 --> 01:34:08,605
An everyday Joe.

1967
01:34:09,480 --> 01:34:13,087
You know, faking my own death
was the easy part.

1968
01:34:13,960 --> 01:34:17,248
But dealing with Bob, day after day,
was the hard part.

1969
01:34:17,400 --> 01:34:18,401
Hey, Phil.

1970
01:34:18,560 --> 01:34:19,641
What, Bob?

1971
01:34:20,560 --> 01:34:22,403
I'll see you on the other side.

1972
01:34:23,080 --> 01:34:25,401
No, I hope we don't. All right?

1973
01:34:25,560 --> 01:34:27,130
Just, no. Bye, bye, bye.

1974
01:34:27,280 --> 01:34:28,281
Just go.

1975
01:34:28,440 --> 01:34:31,171
I made up the Black Badger,
rigged up a blood bag

1976
01:34:31,320 --> 01:34:32,401
and that big dummy bought it.

1977
01:34:32,640 --> 01:34:33,801
Bob!

1978
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:35,923
No, no! Hang on, buddy.

1979
01:34:36,520 --> 01:34:37,931
No, there's some sort of bomb in here.

1980
01:34:38,080 --> 01:34:39,969
You're pushing it closed, I think.

1981
01:34:40,120 --> 01:34:42,202
- No, no, no. Sorry.
- No, don't give up!

1982
01:34:42,400 --> 01:34:43,401
Bye, Bob.

1983
01:34:44,440 --> 01:34:46,761
I'm getting away with
a half a billion dollars.

1984
01:34:46,920 --> 01:34:50,367
And Boy Scout Bob is gonna
spend his life in prison.

1985
01:34:50,520 --> 01:34:52,124
Ain't America great?

1986
01:34:52,920 --> 01:34:57,448
So now you're gonna be
the second partner of Bob's to die.

1987
01:34:57,600 --> 01:34:58,601
Just relax.

1988
01:34:58,760 --> 01:35:01,366
On your knees, Golden Jet.

1989
01:35:11,080 --> 01:35:12,286
What the hell was that?

1990
01:35:14,120 --> 01:35:15,770
Golden Jet flip.

1991
01:35:16,280 --> 01:35:19,204
Yeah? Well, you really suck at it.

1992
01:35:19,400 --> 01:35:20,640
I know.

1993
01:35:20,800 --> 01:35:22,484
Then why'd you do it?

1994
01:35:22,640 --> 01:35:23,641
Distraction.

1995
01:35:27,680 --> 01:35:29,011
Oh, you just pulled his throat out!

1996
01:35:31,480 --> 01:35:33,209
I'll see you on the other side.

1997
01:35:38,320 --> 01:35:39,924
Jet, come here.
Give me your hand, old buddy.

1998
01:35:40,080 --> 01:35:41,809
Oh, shit! Get that away from me!

1999
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:43,161
Sorry, Jet.

2000
01:35:44,200 --> 01:35:46,487
Come here, Jet. That was a trachea.

2001
01:35:46,640 --> 01:35:48,165
Great distraction, man!

2002
01:35:48,320 --> 01:35:49,765
Sorry I had to shoot you, Jet.

2003
01:35:49,920 --> 01:35:51,649
It was the only way
I could save your life.

2004
01:35:51,800 --> 01:35:54,007
But when you shot me
to get Phil to confess

2005
01:35:54,160 --> 01:35:57,648
that he was The Black Badger,
that was some next-level-type shit!

2006
01:35:57,800 --> 01:36:01,566
Yeah, no.
I'm glad you see it the way I saw it.

2007
01:36:01,720 --> 01:36:03,688
That was my plan the whole time. So...

2008
01:36:03,840 --> 01:36:05,524
You are a natural for this line of work.

2009
01:36:05,680 --> 01:36:08,247
I mean, you're smart, you got
the skill set, you're a people person

2010
01:36:08,400 --> 01:36:11,688
and you already got a dope-ass code name,
"The Golden Jet!" What?

2011
01:36:11,840 --> 01:36:13,604
But in the meantime,
we gotta get those encryption codes

2012
01:36:13,760 --> 01:36:15,683
over to Harris right away
or we're gonna be late.

2013
01:36:15,840 --> 01:36:18,207
What are you talking about? Late for what?

2014
01:36:20,200 --> 01:36:25,127
The reunion, dude. What-what!
This shit's on!

2015
01:36:27,080 --> 01:36:29,048
Bob. Damn it.

2016
01:36:52,560 --> 01:36:53,561
Bob!

2017
01:36:53,720 --> 01:36:54,721
One more thing.

2018
01:36:54,880 --> 01:36:56,484
Thanks for securing the satellite codes.

2019
01:36:56,640 --> 01:36:58,165
You really saved my ass.

2020
01:36:58,320 --> 01:36:59,401
Your country thanks you.

2021
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:00,842
Just doing my job.

2022
01:37:01,040 --> 01:37:03,930
I'm really sorry about your hand.
I hope you know that wasn't personal.

2023
01:37:04,080 --> 01:37:05,684
Oh, no hard feelings at all, Pam.

2024
01:37:06,200 --> 01:37:07,690
Besides, everybody makes mistakes.

2025
01:37:07,880 --> 01:37:09,882
Calvin, here, thought
you were The Black Badger.

2026
01:37:11,840 --> 01:37:12,966
I don't... No, I don't think...

2027
01:37:13,120 --> 01:37:15,441
When we were in the plane,
you said, "Hey, Harris is the Black..."

2028
01:37:15,640 --> 01:37:17,404
I think you should... Maybe I...

2029
01:37:17,800 --> 01:37:20,565
Mr. Joyner, it was a pleasure
working with you.

2030
01:37:20,720 --> 01:37:23,451
If you ever want a career change,
you give me a call.

2031
01:37:24,160 --> 01:37:26,367
If I were to give you a call,
how would I get in touch with you?

2032
01:37:26,520 --> 01:37:28,363
Just pick up any phone in your house.

2033
01:37:28,520 --> 01:37:29,646
They're all bugged.

2034
01:37:31,320 --> 01:37:33,049
You're crazy. Hey, you're crazy!

2035
01:37:33,600 --> 01:37:35,523
That's a good one.

2036
01:37:35,680 --> 01:37:38,126
Calvin! I got your text
and came right over.

2037
01:37:38,280 --> 01:37:41,409
Where the hell have you been?
Why did you get out of a helicopter?

2038
01:37:41,840 --> 01:37:43,410
Hey, uh, Maggie.

2039
01:37:43,560 --> 01:37:44,686
Uh, hi!

2040
01:37:45,120 --> 01:37:46,724
Babe, why is Dr. Dan with you?

2041
01:37:47,120 --> 01:37:48,167
Well... Uh...

2042
01:37:48,520 --> 01:37:49,885
That's not Dr. Dan.

2043
01:37:50,040 --> 01:37:52,327
Allow me to properly introduce myself.

2044
01:37:52,480 --> 01:37:56,885
My name is Bob Stone, the artist
formerly known as Robbie Wheirdicht.

2045
01:37:57,040 --> 01:37:58,087
I work for the CIA.

2046
01:37:58,240 --> 01:38:00,242
I roped your husband
into helping me track down a traitor,

2047
01:38:00,400 --> 01:38:03,210
who was gonna sell
military state secrets to a terrorist.

2048
01:38:03,360 --> 01:38:07,208
We did all that, we stopped them,
we saved the free world, and here we are.

2049
01:38:09,040 --> 01:38:10,405
What the hell is going on?

2050
01:38:10,560 --> 01:38:12,210
Okay, listen, listen.

2051
01:38:12,400 --> 01:38:14,402
I've been a fool. All right?

2052
01:38:14,560 --> 01:38:16,562
I thought that my life was a failure.

2053
01:38:16,720 --> 01:38:19,041
I thought that it wasn't special.
But it is special.

2054
01:38:19,240 --> 01:38:21,083
It's special because I have you in it.

2055
01:38:21,240 --> 01:38:24,403
You are my world.
You are what makes me special!

2056
01:38:24,960 --> 01:38:27,122
You're everything to me, Mags.

2057
01:38:27,280 --> 01:38:28,566
I love you.

2058
01:38:29,240 --> 01:38:30,401
I love you.

2059
01:38:35,080 --> 01:38:36,081
Okay.

2060
01:38:37,240 --> 01:38:39,083
Here come the waterworks.

2061
01:38:39,240 --> 01:38:41,242
I promised myself I wouldn't do this.

2062
01:38:43,920 --> 01:38:45,763
- Come on, come on.
- Okay.

2063
01:38:48,720 --> 01:38:50,449
- That's Robbie Wheirdicht?
- Yeah.

2064
01:39:12,800 --> 01:39:14,006
- Hi, Brian.
- Hi, Gail.

2065
01:39:14,160 --> 01:39:16,288
Guys, this isn't a good idea.
You know what?

2066
01:39:16,440 --> 01:39:18,761
I'll just meet you later.
I shouldn't have come.

2067
01:39:18,920 --> 01:39:19,921
Wait, wait, wait.

2068
01:39:20,080 --> 01:39:23,129
Bob, calm down, okay? Listen to me.

2069
01:39:23,280 --> 01:39:25,647
Tonight is not gonna be
how high school was for you 20 years ago.

2070
01:39:25,800 --> 01:39:27,006
I promise.

2071
01:39:27,160 --> 01:39:29,640
Attention, por favor.

2072
01:39:29,840 --> 01:39:33,811
And now, for the moment
you've all been waiting for,

2073
01:39:33,960 --> 01:39:38,522
tonight's vote for the reunion
homecoming king and queen!

2074
01:39:38,680 --> 01:39:40,364
We'll announce the queen in one moment.

2075
01:39:40,520 --> 01:39:42,966
But first, without further ado...

2076
01:39:43,480 --> 01:39:45,323
The new homecoming king

2077
01:39:45,480 --> 01:39:49,166
for the Central High School Centaurs,
Class of 1996 is...

2078
01:39:49,480 --> 01:39:50,686
I really gotta pee, Jet.

2079
01:39:50,840 --> 01:39:52,330
Bob Stone!

2080
01:39:54,840 --> 01:39:56,410
Do we have a Bob Stone?

2081
01:39:56,560 --> 01:39:58,881
Here he is, Bob Stone, huh!

2082
01:39:59,600 --> 01:40:00,761
Yeah!

2083
01:40:01,920 --> 01:40:03,888
Go on, get your rock-hard ass up there.

2084
01:40:04,600 --> 01:40:05,601
For reals?

2085
01:40:05,760 --> 01:40:07,922
For reals, for reals. Go ahead, man.

2086
01:40:08,520 --> 01:40:09,521
Whoo!

2087
01:40:09,760 --> 01:40:11,285
You did it, big guy!

2088
01:40:17,280 --> 01:40:20,363
How did Bob Stone win homecoming king?

2089
01:40:20,640 --> 01:40:22,927
I hacked into the votes on the flight in.

2090
01:40:23,120 --> 01:40:26,090
Calvin Joyner, forensic accountant,
at your service.

2091
01:40:27,440 --> 01:40:29,761
I had no idea you could do that.

2092
01:40:30,520 --> 01:40:33,649
There's a lot of things
that you don't know about me, Maggie.

2093
01:40:34,240 --> 01:40:35,401
No, scratch that I said that.

2094
01:40:35,560 --> 01:40:37,130
It was supposed to
come out cool. It didn't.

2095
01:40:37,280 --> 01:40:38,520
It was something I thought of,
it was like a...

2096
01:40:38,680 --> 01:40:39,727
Forget it.

2097
01:40:41,120 --> 01:40:42,963
Well, well, let's hear it for him!

2098
01:40:43,120 --> 01:40:44,610
Fat Robbie made good.

2099
01:40:44,760 --> 01:40:48,048
King Robbie Weird Dick, our naked mascot.

2100
01:40:48,680 --> 01:40:50,250
Why don't you just
get out of the way, Trevor?

2101
01:40:50,400 --> 01:40:51,731
Or what, Golden Jet?

2102
01:40:51,880 --> 01:40:53,120
You're gonna hop up here
and punch me in the belt?

2103
01:40:53,280 --> 01:40:54,406
Simmer down, Ant-Man.

2104
01:40:54,560 --> 01:40:56,801
- You know what? That's it. That's it.
- It's okay.

2105
01:40:56,960 --> 01:40:58,007
- It's all right.
- No, I've had it!

2106
01:40:58,160 --> 01:40:59,764
- I got it, Jet. It's okay.
- It's okay.

2107
01:40:59,920 --> 01:41:01,046
I'll handle it.

2108
01:41:01,320 --> 01:41:05,245
Whoa, whoa! Hang on. I'm not buying
this whole transformation

2109
01:41:05,400 --> 01:41:07,004
from ugly duckling into swan.

2110
01:41:07,200 --> 01:41:08,201
No one in here is.

2111
01:41:08,360 --> 01:41:11,807
You can fly in, in a bunch of helicopters
and dress up in a thousand suits,

2112
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:15,607
but to everybody, including me,
you'll always just be the fat kid.

2113
01:41:18,880 --> 01:41:20,291
I've been thinking
about this a lot, Trevor.

2114
01:41:21,520 --> 01:41:24,761
And the only thing I want to say
to you is I forgive you.

2115
01:41:25,320 --> 01:41:27,846
You forgive me! Oh, boy! For what?

2116
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:29,525
For being rad as shit.

2117
01:41:29,680 --> 01:41:30,886
Fuck you, fat boy.

2118
01:41:31,080 --> 01:41:32,491
Still a scared little bitch.

2119
01:41:36,800 --> 01:41:38,006
I don't like bullies.

2120
01:41:41,800 --> 01:41:44,041
And the name is Bob Stone, bitch!

2121
01:41:44,360 --> 01:41:45,361
Whoo-whoo!

2122
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:47,411
Come on, baby. Step over.

2123
01:41:51,360 --> 01:41:52,521
Hi, everybody!

2124
01:41:53,480 --> 01:41:56,962
Most of you knew me back in high school as

2125
01:41:57,920 --> 01:41:59,410
Robbie Wheirdicht.

2126
01:41:59,600 --> 01:42:01,523
- That's Robbie Wheirdicht?
- No way!

2127
01:42:01,680 --> 01:42:03,728
I wore prescription pants every day.

2128
01:42:05,800 --> 01:42:08,041
Twenty years ago, in this gym,

2129
01:42:09,240 --> 01:42:11,208
I stood in front of you all

2130
01:42:12,040 --> 01:42:13,166
naked

2131
01:42:13,880 --> 01:42:15,291
and embarrassed.

2132
01:42:16,240 --> 01:42:18,163
Some of you might remember that day.

2133
01:42:19,360 --> 01:42:21,488
A lot of you probably even laughed.

2134
01:42:22,480 --> 01:42:24,130
But that's okay.

2135
01:42:25,240 --> 01:42:27,846
Tonight's gonna be different because

2136
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:31,083
my best friend is here with me.

2137
01:42:33,240 --> 01:42:38,406
And he taught me what it means
to be the hero of your own story.

2138
01:42:41,160 --> 01:42:42,525
Would you hold this for me, please?

2139
01:42:44,240 --> 01:42:46,163
Being the hero of your own story

2140
01:42:46,320 --> 01:42:50,689
isn't about stopping bad guys
or climbing mountains.

2141
01:42:50,840 --> 01:42:53,969
It's about overcoming bullies
in your life,

2142
01:42:54,120 --> 01:42:57,044
whatever or whomever they may be.

2143
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:00,685
It's about putting it all out there

2144
01:43:01,360 --> 01:43:02,407
for everyone

2145
01:43:03,760 --> 01:43:04,921
to see.

2146
01:43:05,760 --> 01:43:07,603
And it's realizing that, in life,

2147
01:43:07,760 --> 01:43:10,127
the most important thing that you can be

2148
01:43:11,240 --> 01:43:12,321
is yourself.

2149
01:43:13,080 --> 01:43:17,404
So, Central High, Class of 1996,

2150
01:43:18,360 --> 01:43:21,250
this is me, Robbie Wheirdicht.

2151
01:43:32,520 --> 01:43:35,126
Oh, my God! Bob just went commando!

2152
01:43:36,960 --> 01:43:38,564
Yes! Yes!

2153
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:44,604
Way to go, Bob!

2154
01:43:45,480 --> 01:43:46,720
Be you!

2155
01:43:47,240 --> 01:43:49,322
Robbie! Robbie! Robbie!

2156
01:43:49,480 --> 01:43:52,484
Robbie! Robbie! Robbie!

2157
01:43:58,000 --> 01:43:59,161
Hey, man!

2158
01:43:59,320 --> 01:44:01,527
Dude, this is amazing!
I'm so happy for you!

2159
01:44:01,680 --> 01:44:03,409
Thank you, Jet! I feel so free!

2160
01:44:03,920 --> 01:44:04,967
- Come here.
- No, no, no.

2161
01:44:05,120 --> 01:44:06,884
Your junk is out.

2162
01:44:07,240 --> 01:44:09,811
- Oh. Sorry, Jet.
- Excuse me.

2163
01:44:12,240 --> 01:44:13,605
Hi, Robbie.

2164
01:44:14,680 --> 01:44:16,762
- You probably don't remember me.
- Darla.

2165
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:20,048
- Is that Darla McGuckian?
- Yeah.

2166
01:44:20,200 --> 01:44:22,487
Wow! She looks great!

2167
01:44:22,840 --> 01:44:24,205
Didn't she used to have a lazy eye?

2168
01:44:24,400 --> 01:44:25,731
- Two of them.
- Wow.

2169
01:44:25,880 --> 01:44:27,962
I can't believe you remember me.

2170
01:44:28,120 --> 01:44:29,610
Remember you?

2171
01:44:29,760 --> 01:44:31,330
How could I forget you?

2172
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:35,800
You still have the same sweet smile,
the same sweet face.

2173
01:44:36,360 --> 01:44:39,204
But your hair's changed.
You used to wear it curlier.

2174
01:44:39,360 --> 01:44:40,600
I like it though.

2175
01:44:41,040 --> 01:44:42,690
You haven't changed at all.

2176
01:44:42,880 --> 01:44:44,405
Oh, I don't know.

2177
01:44:50,520 --> 01:44:52,363
You're still as beautiful as ever.

2178
01:44:52,680 --> 01:44:53,681
Oh.

2179
01:45:03,040 --> 01:45:04,769
- Yeah, Bob!
- Go, Bob!

2180
01:45:05,760 --> 01:45:07,250
No, no, no.

2181
01:45:14,480 --> 01:45:16,562
Oh, I got spinny.

2182
01:45:16,760 --> 01:45:18,569
Super spinny.

2183
01:45:21,160 --> 01:45:22,969
Yeah, that's nice.

2184
01:45:23,640 --> 01:45:26,405
- Can I take you to get ice-cream...
- Yes.

2185
01:45:27,240 --> 01:45:29,242
Yes. Yes, yes, yes.

2186
01:45:29,840 --> 01:45:32,844
Super lactose intolerant, but that's okay.
Let's roll the dice.

2187
01:45:35,840 --> 01:45:36,841
That's my jam!

2188
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:38,047
Go show them what you got.

2189
01:45:38,240 --> 01:45:40,083
- All right, Darla.
- Okay.

2190
01:45:40,400 --> 01:45:42,402
Darla, hi. Calvin.

2191
01:45:42,600 --> 01:45:44,250
Hi, Colin. Nice to meet you.

2192
01:45:44,840 --> 01:45:46,763
- Calvin.
- And Maggie.

2193
01:45:46,920 --> 01:45:48,604
Maggie, hi!

2194
01:45:48,760 --> 01:45:51,081
Hi. You look so good.

2195
01:45:51,280 --> 01:45:53,601
- My gosh, you look the same.
- You do too.

2196
01:45:53,760 --> 01:45:54,761
Oh, I don't know.

2197
01:45:54,920 --> 01:45:57,048
You probably remember me
as The Golden Jet.

2198
01:45:57,240 --> 01:45:59,846
Your name's Golden Jeff? Hi, Jeff.

2199
01:46:00,600 --> 01:46:02,284
It's okay. Good to see you.

2200
01:46:05,680 --> 01:46:08,126
- Good going, Bob!
- Come on, Bob!

2201
01:46:23,840 --> 01:46:25,365
- All right.
- Good luck!

2202
01:46:25,560 --> 01:46:26,800
- Love you.
- I love you.

2203
01:46:26,960 --> 01:46:28,849
I love you, too, little Golden Jet!

2204
01:46:31,520 --> 01:46:32,521
Mmm...

2205
01:46:32,680 --> 01:46:33,761
Okay. Uh...

2206
01:46:34,840 --> 01:46:36,410
How long do you think he's been there?

2207
01:46:37,160 --> 01:46:38,969
Hmm, probably since last night.

2208
01:46:39,560 --> 01:46:40,971
All right, babe, I'll see you later.

2209
01:46:41,160 --> 01:46:42,889
Have fun with your friend!

2210
01:46:48,480 --> 01:46:49,481
Who, me?

2211
01:46:49,640 --> 01:46:50,926
Yes, you.

2212
01:47:00,120 --> 01:47:01,451
Wow, Jet!

2213
01:47:01,640 --> 01:47:03,324
You look amazing!

2214
01:47:03,520 --> 01:47:05,284
- Do you think?
- Oh, what? Yes!

2215
01:47:05,480 --> 01:47:08,521
I just didn't know the kind of look
to go for on my first day at the agency.

2216
01:47:08,680 --> 01:47:10,728
You look like a black Will Smith,
or something.

2217
01:47:10,920 --> 01:47:13,807
Okay, I'm not sure if that's racist
or not, but I'll take it as a compliment.

2218
01:47:13,960 --> 01:47:15,371
All right, cool. Yeah, come on!

2219
01:47:15,520 --> 01:47:16,681
Okay.

2220
01:47:17,320 --> 01:47:18,526
All right. Don't be nervous.

2221
01:47:18,680 --> 01:47:20,444
You are gonna do great.
They're gonna love you!

2222
01:47:20,600 --> 01:47:22,011
Oh, Jet, Jet, Jet!

2223
01:47:22,200 --> 01:47:23,326
Um, before we go, man, uh...

2224
01:47:24,760 --> 01:47:25,886
I got a surprise for you.

2225
01:47:27,120 --> 01:47:29,043
Okay. What's the surprise?

2226
01:47:29,200 --> 01:47:31,851
Well, you gotta close your eyes first.

2227
01:47:33,520 --> 01:47:34,681
Eyes are closed.

2228
01:47:34,880 --> 01:47:35,881
No peeking.

2229
01:47:41,360 --> 01:47:42,521
Open your eyes.

2230
01:47:46,840 --> 01:47:49,207
Is that my... Is that my jacket?

2231
01:47:49,360 --> 01:47:50,407
Yes!

2232
01:47:50,560 --> 01:47:52,562
- Bob, is that my jacket?
- Yes!

2233
01:47:52,720 --> 01:47:54,165
- No, wait a minute.
- Yes!

2234
01:47:54,360 --> 01:47:56,044
Oh, my God!

2235
01:47:56,400 --> 01:47:57,526
Dude, where'd you get this from?

2236
01:47:57,680 --> 01:48:01,321
Well, I sleep in it most nights,
but it's clean now, totally good. Yeah!

2237
01:48:01,480 --> 01:48:04,086
Man! You are the man! Yes!

2238
01:48:04,240 --> 01:48:07,130
- Family hug! What?
- Ooh. Okay.

2239
01:48:09,200 --> 01:48:10,326
All right, let's go!

2240
01:48:10,480 --> 01:48:11,811
- Okay.
- All right.

2241
01:48:26,200 --> 01:48:28,168
You still ride?

2242
01:48:28,680 --> 01:48:30,921
Cut! The fire department's here.

2243
01:48:31,200 --> 01:48:33,601
All right. That's our cue, guys!

2244
01:48:34,520 --> 01:48:36,249
Here we are shooting Central Intelligence.

2245
01:48:36,440 --> 01:48:38,363
They shut us down.
The fire trucks are out here.

2246
01:48:38,520 --> 01:48:40,204
- Shut the fuck up!
- Will you get the fuck out of my video?

2247
01:48:40,360 --> 01:48:41,361
I'mma slap the dogshit out of you.

2248
01:48:41,520 --> 01:48:42,521
Why do you do your video behind me?

2249
01:48:42,680 --> 01:48:43,886
- I'm trying to do my video!
- This is my video!

2250
01:48:44,040 --> 01:48:45,530
- You're in my fucking video!
- I'm pissed off.

2251
01:48:45,680 --> 01:48:47,170
Watch your mouth,
I'll slap the shit out of you.

2252
01:48:47,320 --> 01:48:48,321
Fuck you!

2253
01:48:49,280 --> 01:48:51,806
Okay. You have it your way.

2254
01:48:52,760 --> 01:48:54,762
You leave me no choice.

2255
01:48:56,040 --> 01:48:57,041
Pam...

2256
01:48:58,360 --> 01:48:59,361
Tickler! Tickler!

2257
01:48:59,520 --> 01:49:02,046
Where are the codes? Where are the codes?

2258
01:49:03,040 --> 01:49:04,530
It's just nice.

2259
01:49:06,200 --> 01:49:08,771
In here and it's kind of all...

2260
01:49:10,280 --> 01:49:11,691
- Oh, my God.
- Sorry.

2261
01:49:16,280 --> 01:49:17,645
- Can you do both?
- Yeah.

2262
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:19,126
Oh, my God!

2263
01:49:22,360 --> 01:49:24,169
It's called "soul gazing."

2264
01:49:24,320 --> 01:49:27,881
Stare into my soul
and I'll stare into yours.

2265
01:49:28,080 --> 01:49:29,525
- Come in. Shh.
- You're not my wife!

2266
01:49:29,680 --> 01:49:31,091
Oh, that's it.

2267
01:49:32,960 --> 01:49:34,371
- Bob, I'm gonna...
- Shh.

2268
01:49:35,480 --> 01:49:36,720
I promise you'll never...

2269
01:49:38,160 --> 01:49:39,844
Let's keep on, keep on.

2270
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:41,047
Okay, for real this time.

2271
01:49:42,160 --> 01:49:44,162
It's for real.
This is for real, guys, yeah.

2272
01:49:44,680 --> 01:49:45,806
- That's it!
- Oh.

2273
01:49:45,960 --> 01:49:47,485
One more. Come on.

2274
01:49:47,680 --> 01:49:48,806
- I can't do this, I'm not...
- Shh.

2275
01:49:48,960 --> 01:49:51,645
Oh, my God. I've fucking had it.

2276
01:49:51,800 --> 01:49:52,801
Lock it! We're professionals.

2277
01:49:52,960 --> 01:49:54,769
- This is what we do. You ready?
- Come on, baby!

2278
01:49:54,920 --> 01:49:56,649
I'm gonna hit you. I told you!

2279
01:49:56,800 --> 01:49:58,006
Fuck!

2280
01:49:59,960 --> 01:50:00,961
Are you not a super tool?

2281
01:50:01,120 --> 01:50:03,407
You're not even Robbie Wheirdicht.
You're Bob Stone!

2282
01:50:04,120 --> 01:50:05,645
- I made that name up.
- So what?

2283
01:50:05,800 --> 01:50:07,290
- It's not real.
- What does that mean?

2284
01:50:07,440 --> 01:50:11,331
What, you think Mr. T and Sting

2285
01:50:11,480 --> 01:50:12,720
and The Rock...

2286
01:50:12,880 --> 01:50:14,370
You think those guys are real?

2287
01:50:14,520 --> 01:50:17,524
That's a bunch of dumbass nicknames
by a bunch of dumbass people.

2288
01:56:02,720 --> 01:56:04,006
Fanny!
