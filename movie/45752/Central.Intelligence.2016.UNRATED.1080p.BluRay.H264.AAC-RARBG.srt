类似于艺术照片
It's kind of like Instagram, right?

79
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:17,766
但不是做艺术化处理
But, instead of filters,

80
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,251
而是让你的鸡鸡变大
it just makes your junk look huge.

81
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,329
能拉长3-6英吋
Like, three to six inches bigger.

82

Why are you all cranky-pants this morning, huh?

91
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,606
因为升迁的是伊森 而不是你?

96
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,968
管它呢 你跟我们一起吃午饭吧
Who cares? Hey, you should come to lunch with us.

We're gonna be celebrating his pro-mosh!

98
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,688
你去舔舔他也有好处
It'll probably be good for you to kiss the ring a bit.

99
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,645
舔舔他?
"Kiss the ring a bit"?

100
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,848
你可以按照你的处世之道
Hey, you play your chessboard however you like, okay?

101
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:09,364

Do you wanna move tables? I know this kind of sucks.

114
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:50,369
不 这没什么不好
No, no. It doesn't suck.

115
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,846
如果我想喝那种冰茶

我打算明晚穿的这件裙装
This is the dress that I'm thinking about wearing.

121
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,201
哦
Oh!

122
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,125
老公 我希望明晚每个女人都会嫉妒
Honey, I want every single girl to be jealous tomorrow night.

123
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:08,072


124
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,647

你对升迁的事很失望 我理解
You're disappointed about the promotion. I get it.

133
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:27,242
不是因为升迁
This is not about the promotion.

134
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,046
而是因为我不想明天晚上
Okay, this has to do with me not wanting to spend my Friday night

135

"I guess we missed that one."

142
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,451
你最近就是因此而闷闷不乐?
Is this why you've been so weird and moody lately?

143
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,965
就因为担心同学聚会?
'Cause you're freaking out about the reunion?

144
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,167
- 不是  - 而且当会计
- No. - And what's the matter

145
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,890
有什么不好 你爱你的工作
with being an accountant? You love your job.

146
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,530
不 你爱你的工作
No, you love your job.

147
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,250
我是擅长于我的工作 不一样
I'm good at my job. It's not the same thing.

148
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,401
这么说不公平
Honey, that's not fair.

149
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,210
你是你公司的合伙人
You're a partner at your firm.

150
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:58,245
而我却在门前有一个, 充气大猩猩的公司工作.
Instead, I work in a building with a giant, inflatable gorilla out in front of it.

151
00:08:56,787 --> 00:08:58,289


152
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,209
我不希望自己的人生顶峰是在高中
Look, I don't want to be the guy that peaked in high school

153
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,328
顶峰之后 人生就直线下滑
and, after he peaked, his life went like this...

154
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,650
可能不是这个声音
I don't know the sound that that thing makes,

155
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:07,841
反正你懂我的意思
but you know what I'm trying to do.

156
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,161
我就是那个直线下滑的人
I'm the guy that went down, okay?

157
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,407
- 耶. - 到了现在
- Yeah. - Then my life

158
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:11,846
我成了令人失望的人
down here became a disappointment.

159
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,286
我就是这样
That's what I'll be.

160
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,441
哇
Wow.

161
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:16,521
怎么了
What?

162
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:20,560
真没想到你和我一起的人生原来是这么直线下滑的失望
I had no idea that your life with me was such a soundless, crashing disappointment!

163
00:09:18,058 --> 00:09:20,519


164
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,370
别这么做
Don't do that.

165
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,443
- 别这么做  - 就是这个声音
- That's not... Don't do that. - That's the sound.

166
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,125
知道我要发出什么声音吗
You want to know the sound I'm about to make right now?

167
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,361
就是我不去的声音
The sound of me not going.

168
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:28,931
就是这个声音
That's the sound I'm making.

169
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,241
我不去了
I'm not going.

170
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,241
是啊
Yeah.

171
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,889
哼-哼-哼.
Mmm-mmm-mmm.

172
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,041
不
No.

173
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:56,169
不去
Not going to that.

174
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,281
鲍勃·斯通?
Bob Stone?

175
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:16,801
好吧
Okay.

176
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,241
喂
Hello?

177
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,807
- 嗨  - 你吓了我一跳
- Hey. - Girl, you scared me.

178
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:33,606
- 是吗  - 是的 我还以为你是…
- I did? - Yes. I thought that you were...

179
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:36,648
我刚刚…
I just... On the...

180
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,971
算了 我很高兴你打来电话
Never mind. Hey, I'm glad you called.

181
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,401
今天午餐的事我很抱歉
I'm sorry about lunch today.

182
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,247
我是个傻瓜 老婆
I'm an idiot, babe.

183
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,050
我都不知道自己是怎么了
I don't even know what's going on with me right now.

184
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,725
- 真的  - 是吗
- I really don't. - Yeah?

185
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,882
其实呢 老公
Actually, honey,

186
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,889
这正是我打电话要跟你谈的
that's what I was calling to talk to you about.

187
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:55,529
老公 我觉得我们该找个人看看
Look, honey, I think that we should see someone.

188
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:59,564
你什么意思 找人看看
What do you mean, "Someone"? What do you mean?

189
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,842
找人看看 找个心理医生
See someone, like a therapist.

190
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:04,328
老婆 没有黑人去看心理医生
Honey, black people don't go to therapy.

191
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,571
黑人都是去理发店
We go to barbershops.

192
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,245
在那里谈论我们的烦恼
That's where we talk out our problems.

193
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,721
或者是看电影"理发店"非此即彼
Or we watch the movie Barbershop. One or the other.

194
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,450
我父母离婚前
Look, my parents were really unhappy

195
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,523
很多年就一直很不幸福
for a long time before they got divorced.

196
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:18,162
如果他们当时找个心理医生 也许就不会离婚了
And maybe if they saw someone sooner, they would still be married.

197
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:21,090
我只是想把这苗头掐死在萌芽里
I just want to nip this thing in the bud, whatever it is.

198
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,601
不希望最后像我父母一样
I don't want to end up like my parents.

199
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:27,130
你好
Wassup?

200
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:35,847
拜托 如果你不愿意的话 就当是为了我
Please, just do it for me, if not for you.

201
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,121
好吧 呃
All right. Uh...

202
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:41,930
- 你想什么时候去  - 真的吗
- When? When do you want to do it? - Really?

203
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:44,249
医生说他可以在晚上六点接待我们
The doctor said he could see us at 6:00 p.m.

204
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:47,287
六点 什么时候 今晚?
Um... 6:00 p.m., when? Tonight?

205
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,283
是的 有困难吗
Yeah. Yeah, is that a problem?

206
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:53,365
天啊 怪鸡鸡鲍勃?
Holy shit! Robbie Wheirdicht?

207
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,891
加尔文 老公 你在吗
Calvin, honey? Hello?

208
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,485
我在
Um, yeah.

209
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:01,564
我不能去 我今晚有别的安排 老婆
I can't. I already made plans for tonight, baby.

210
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,961
- 跟谁  - 跟鲍勃·斯通
- Plans with who? - With Bob Stone.

211
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,162
鲍勃·斯通是谁 听起来像个假名
Who's Bob Stone? That sounds like a fake name.

212
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:09,642
不是 你记得高中同学怪鸡鸡鲍勃吗
No, no. You remember Robbie Wheirdicht, from high school?

213
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:10,801
不记得
No.

214
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,809
在返校节被特丽莎揍了的那个
The guy who got beaten up by Trisha Demarco at homecoming?

215
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,087
不记得
No.

216
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,561
就是文艺演出上 假唱Coolio的歌
The kid that tried to rap along to Coolio's 1,2,3,4 at the talent show

217
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,324
中间唱跑调了
but then he kinda lost his way, midway through

218
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,130
只能站着摇头晃脑的那个
so he just started bopping his head, and he stood there?

219
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,805
不记得 没印象
No. Nothing.

220
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,162
高四那年被光屁股扔进体育馆的那个
The guy who got thrown out the gym, butt-ass-naked, senior year?

221
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,321
天啊 我记得
Oh, my God, yeah!

222
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:27,130
直接说最后一个不就行了吗
Why wouldn't you start with that?

223
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,890
因为我觉得这个不体面
Because I thought that was kind of mean. I don't know.

224
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,605
在那之后 他再没回学校 是吗
He never came back to school after that, right?

225
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:32,967
连期末考试和毕业典礼都没来
Like, not for finals or graduation or anything.

226
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:35,003
他不是参军了吗
Didn't he join the military or something?

227
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:39,607
拿不准. 不知道他有没有参军, 反正他改名为鲍勃·斯通
I'm not sure. I don't know if he did or not, but he changed his name to "Bob Stone"

228
00:12:37,216 --> 00:12:39,552


229
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,842
而且他要来参加高中同学聚会
and apparently he's in town for the high school reunion.

230
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,048
他想今晚请我吃饭 我已经答应了
He wants to go to dinner tonight, and I kinda already said "yes."

231
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,241
- 好  - 如果你要我取消
- Okay. - If you want me to cancel,

232
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,845
我会的
I will. You know?

233
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,365
如果你要我这么做 我不介意
If that's what you want, I don't mind.

234
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:51,162
虽然有点变态 但随便你
Mmm-mmm. I mean, it's a little weird, but whatever.

235
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:53,687
我问问医生明天能不能安排
I'll just see if the doctor can fit us in tomorrow.

236
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,968
- 明天中午如何  - 好的
- How about at lunch time? - Okay. All right, fine.

237
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,360
好的 我爱你
Okay, good. I love you.

238
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:59,249
我也爱你 老婆 真的
I love you, too, babe. I do.

239
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:05,842
- 天啊  - 什么声音
- Oh, my... - What is that?

240
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,809
- 好  - 加尔文 你是不是…
- Okay. - Calvin? Are you...

241
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:08,961
我爱你 再见
Love you. Bye-bye.

242
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,081
不
No!

243
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,886
停 停
Stop, stop!

244
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,446
嗨 我…
Hey, man. I...

245
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,688
嗨 你们好
Hey! What's up, guys?

246
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,806
恭喜你的升迁
Congratulations on that promotion, man.

247
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:22,961
很不简单
It's quite the thing.

248
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,966
谢谢 喂 看这个不得体
Thank you. Hey, that's not work appropriate.

249
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,281
是啊
Yup.

250
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,044
不应该 不应该
Not cool, man. Not cool.

251
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,244
喂 发给我
Hey, forward that to me.

252
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:46,921
真的吗
For real man, seriously?

253
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,764
是的 看着点 小子
Yeah. Watch it, punk.

254
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,651
你也看着点
Excuse you, too.

255
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:13,401
哥们
My man!

256
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:14,971
别过来
Back the fuck up!

257
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:17,165
- 喂  - 别过来
- Whoa! - Back up, man!

258
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,329
好吧 我让你尝尝我的拳头
Fine. I'll give you these fists.

259
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,726
我会揍你
I'll fist your ass.

260
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,451
加尔文 是我 鲍勃
Calvin. It's me, Bob.

261
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,442
什么 我认识你吗
What? Sorry, do I know you?

262
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,401
认识我…
Do you know...

263
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:30,564
高中同学怪鸡鸡鲍勃
Robbie Wheirdicht from high school!

264
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,404
不会吧 什么
Are you kidding? What?

265
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:36,281
- 等等 你是怪鸡鸡鲍勃?  - 是的
- Wait, you're Robbie Wheirdicht? - Yeah!

266
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,725
天啊 你得瘦了200斤吧
God, man, look at you! You've lost, like, 200 pounds!

267
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,484
都变成肌肉了
I see you gained it back in muscle.

268
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:43,244
天啊 你看起来真好
Oh, my God! You look great!

269
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:45,329
- 不 你看起来真好  - 得了吧
- No, you look great! - Stop it.

270
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,847
不 你还是高中时那个样子
No, you haven't changed since high school, dude!

271
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:51,249
你现在性感的要命
No, you're just sexy as dick right now.

272
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:53,448
这种话你也能说的出口
You don't look somebody in the eyes and say that.

273
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,647
我们大醉一场吧
Hey, let's get hammered.

274
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,048
我明早还要上班 我还是…
I got an early day at work, so I'll probably...

275
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,281
来吧 我请客
No, come on, I'm buying!

276
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,441
天
Oh, shit.

277
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,001
哼.
Mmm.

278
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:04,040
对不起 我实在太惊讶了
I'm sorry, man. I am blown away right now.

279
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:06,402
你以前是胖子鲍勃
Dude, you used to be Fat Robbie.

280
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,881
看你现在 完全大变样了
Look at you! This is like a total transformation.

281
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,690
简直成了大力神
You look like Hercules or somebody.

282
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:12,205
你是怎么做到的 告诉我
What did you do? Come on, give it to me.

283
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:14,328
- 也没怎么  - 得了吧
- I didn't do much, really. - Stop it.

284
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,842
我只做了一件事
All right. I just did one thing.

285
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,207
说吧 我想知道
Come on, I need to know.

286
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:20,847
我每天锻炼6小时
I worked out six hours a day, every day,

287
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,490
这20年来从未间断
for the last 20 years straight.

288
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:26,646
- 人人都能做到这一点  - 是啊
- I mean, anybody can do it, right? - Yeah.

289
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:31,566
是啊 我一直在练热瑜伽
Yeah. You know, I've gotten into hot yoga.

290
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,651
我开始去训练班
I started doing some sessions.

291
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:35,801
呃.
h-huh.

292
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,480
这独角兽不错啊
Nice unicorn, man.

293
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:40,847
是啊 我很喜欢独角兽
Oh, yeah, I'm big-time into 'corns.

294
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,166
很神奇
So magical, right?

295
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,527
它们是世上最凶残的动物
You know, they're the most lethal animal on the planet.

296
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:45,921
给
Here you go.

297
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:48,082
两位 我叫莱克西
Guys, my name's Lexi.

298
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,446
需要什么就说一声
Just let me know if you need anything.

299
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:50,841
好
Okay.

300
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:54,369
任何方面的需求
I mean, like, anything at all.

301
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,211
好的
Okie-dokie.

302
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:59,571
你真逗 你有没有自拍过裸照
You're funny. Do you ever, like, Snapchat?

303
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:02,371
- 没有 其实…  - 我没问你
- Oh, no. You know... - I wasn't talking to you.

304
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,041
没 没 我没拍过
No, no, no. I don't do that.

305
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,726
我只是跟高中老同学叙旧
I'm just catching up with an old friend from high school.

306
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,568
你人真好
Aw. You're so sweet.

307
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,411
我也觉得独角兽很性感
I think unicorns are sexy, too.

308
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,609
你经常碰到这种事吧
That must happen to you all the time, right?

309
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,081
没有
Ah, nah.

310
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,409
这些风流韵事
I mean, all that meaningless sex is just...

311
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,210
不再是我的菜了
It's not my bag anymore, CJ.

312
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:25,721
我希望能有感情交流
No, now, I'm looking for more of an emotional connection.

313
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,001
我下一个交往的女人
The next woman I lay with,

314
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:28,924
她的内在美
she's gonna be beautiful on the inside,

315
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,764
要和外在美一样
just as much as she is on the outside.

316
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:34,086
对了 你在高中时喜欢的那个女生怎么样了?
Hey, wait. Whatever happened to that girl that you liked in high school?

317
00:16:32,868 --> 00:16:34,328


318
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,931
天 那个"天才小医生"女生
Oh, God, man. The "Doogie Howser" girl.

319
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,923
她才14岁就上了高四
She was 14, but somehow she was a senior.

320
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,206
上学穿着斗篷
She wore a cape.

321
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:43,161

小甜蜜
"Yucky Gucky."

323
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,761
- 她是不是有个眼睛弱视?  - 两个都是
- Didn't she have a lazy eye or something? - Two of 'em.

324
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,127
对
Right.

325
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,321
不过 我不想谈我的事
Hey, but listen, I don't wanna talk about me.

326
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:51,481
我想谈谈你
I wanna talk about you.

327
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:52,926
我听说你和麦吉·约翰逊结婚了
I heard that you and Maggie Johnson got hitched.

328
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,605
是啊
Oh, yeah.

329
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:56,569
大学毕业后就结婚了
Yeah, man, right after college.

330
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:00,122
哇 全校头号美女和头号酷哥
Wow! The prettiest girl in school, and the coolest guy in school!

331
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,281
我有福气
Oh, man, I got lucky.

332
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,771
你俩简直就是金童玉女
I mean, you guys are like a power couple, dude!

333
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:04,445
- 不 不  - 是的
- No, no. - Yes!

334
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:07,444
你俩就像泰勒·斯威夫特是她现在的男朋友
You're like Taylor Swift and whoever she's dating right now.

335
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:10,080
- 金童玉女  - 谢谢
- Power. - Uh, thanks!

336
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,725
你们有孩子吗
Yeah. You guys got kids?

337
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,285
还没有
No. No kids yet.

338
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:15,363
我们本打算大学后就生孩子
We planned on it after college,

339
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:18,569
但麦吉去了法律学院 我的工作又经常换
but Maggie went to law school, I kept changing jobs.

340
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:22,128
现在要孩子不合适
You know, having kids just isn't in our cards right now.

341
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:23,281
目前还不行
Not at this point, that's all.

342
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:24,487
- 噢  - 是的
- Oh, okay. - Yeah.

343
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:28,128
我不想谈我和麦吉
I don't wanna talk about me and Maggie and myself.

344
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,691
你呢 你现在做什么
What about you? What are you doing?

345
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,444
我还没问你什么工作呢
I didn't even ask you, man. What do you do for work?

346
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,485
我是政府承包商
I'm a government contractor.

347
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:36,331
不错 承包建筑工程?
Okay, that's cool. Like, what, buildings and stuff?

348
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:38,241
差不多
Yeah, sort of.

349
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,326
但我刚被解雇
But I kinda just got fired.

350
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,608
- 靠 我很遗憾  - 没什么
- Oh, shit! I'm sorry, man. - Oh, it's okay.

351
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:45,445
去他们的 他们都太死板了
Screw those guys, anyway. They're way too corporate.

352
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:48,490
我们这样的人是领袖人物 对吗
'Cause dudes like me and you, I mean, we're alpha dogs, right?

353
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:50,523
我们是开拓者和先驱者
I mean, we're pathfinders and trailblazers.

354
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:53,365
不会听任何人的摆布 对吗
And we don't listen to what anyone tells us, right?

355
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,251
- 对 - 没错
- Yeah, right. - Yeah.

356
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:00,849
别人给我一些预先核准的参数
I mean, come on, man, I sorta path-find a little bit

357
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:05,130
我也会开拓出一些东西来
along certain preapproved parameters that are given to me.

358
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:08,682
我愿意开拓 但都是有个框架
I'm willing to path-find but it's all about how it's set up.

359
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:13,243
不过在这个框架内 我很能开拓 你会很惊讶的
But within the box that I have, I go nuts. You'll be surprised.

360
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,646
有天一个人对我说：
I had a guy tell me the other day,

361
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:17,644
加尔文 我需要那份文件的
"Hey, Calvin, you know, I need those accounting numbers back

362
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,211
会计数字
"from, you know, the file."

363
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:22,210
- 我说：你去死吧 吉姆  - 好啊
- I said, "Go fuck yourself, Jim." - Yeah.

364
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:25,603
我并没说 因为当时不在我的框架内
I didn't say it because I wasn't in my box,

365
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:29,603
- 但我心里想过  - 没错 好啊
- but I thought about it. - Exactly! Yeah! Yeah!

366
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,650
我有个想法 我们换白酒吧
I got an idea. Let's do shots!

367
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:32,881
不
No!

368
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:34,804
对不起我要拒绝
I'm sorry for saying it like that, but no.

369
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,644
我有10年没喝白酒了
I haven't had shots in almost 10 years, man.

370
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:39,047
拜托 一定要喝 我们在庆祝呢
What? Come on, we have to! We're celebrating!

371
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:41,041
庆祝什么
Celebrating what?

372
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,362
庆祝我跟高中最酷的人在一起
Celebrating that I'm hanging with the coolest kid in high school.

373
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,363

You got to be shitting me. Wow!

376
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,129
我得…天啊
I haven't... God!

377
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,722
多少年没听过这个外号了
It's been forever since I heard that, man!

378
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:57,881

380
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:00,321
不 就一杯
No. One shot.

381
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,562

Just one, okay? Bob, it's been a while.

天啊 你记得这个吗
Oh, shit! You remember this?

383
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,725
这在以前是睡衣派对
This was the jammy-jam!

384
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,882
你系着腰包吗 鲍勃
What's that? Is that a fanny pack, Bob?

385
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:10,570
是的 你要一个吗
Hell, yeah! Dude, you want one?

386

不用了
No, it's okay.

387
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,685

你何必这么不讲理
Dude, you don't have to be a dick about it.

那样的话你只有一条路
'Cause there's only one way back, bro.

401
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,848
去重症病房的路
Through intensive care, bro.

402
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,761
你是指别人吗 如果是 那我再说话
Was that the last "bro"? 'Cause if it was, then I'll talk.

403

你是在说笑吗
That supposed to be funny?

404

你是说相声的?

这种健身房里练出来的肌肉吓不住任何人
Those gym muscles aren't scaring anybody, pal.

412
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,448
- 这种吗  - 我们走吧 没关系
- Oh, these? - Let's just go. It's okay.

413
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:10,120
不 我们不走 此人侮辱你
No, we're not gonna go. This man insulted you.

414
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:12,089
他不道歉我们不走
And we're not gonna leave until he apologizes.

415
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,288
- 没关系  - 有矛盾了吗
- It's okay. - Hey, we got a problem here?

416
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,482
- 没有  - 是的 有大矛盾了
- No, no. - Yeah, we got a big problem.

417
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:19,325
你这位朋友侮辱了我的朋友
Your friend, here, really insulted my friend

418
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:20,481
他需要道歉
and he needs to apologize.

419
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:21,641
我看他不需要
I don't think he does.

420
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:22,801
不需要
He doesn't.

421
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,849
听我说
Oh, you know what, man?

422
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,287
我看情况有点失控
I think this whole situation's getting a little out of control.

423
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:28,601
我能解决此事
I can fix this whole thing.

424
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:31,127
我买些玉米脆饼"爆炸"牌的
I'll order some nachos. The "Explosions."

425
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:33,647
有四层奶酪的 我们一起吃
It's got four cheeses! Let's eat 'em together.

426
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:34,847
干脆 你们都吃了吧
You know what? You take them.

427
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,041
我们走
Let's go.

428
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,326
不 我们哪儿也不去 杰
Nah. We're not going anywhere, Jet.

429
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:38,970
这事很快就解决
This whole thing will be over in a jiff.

430
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,645
这么解决如何
Hey, how about this?

431
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:43,320
你和你的男朋友对这位里克道歉
Why don't you and your boyfriend apologize to Big Rick here

432
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:45,687
然后你们去停车场互相撸管
and then go jerk each other in the parking lot?

433
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,127
这非常…
That's a lot...

434
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,327
你说的对 加尔文
Yeah. You're right, CJ.

435
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,131
这是一个脾气暴躁的人说的很歧视同性恋的话
That's a lot of homophobia coming out of a very angry man.

436
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,807
你该找个心理医生看看
You need to go get that looked at by a trained professional.

437
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:56,167
但既然你让事态升级
But, since you have escalated this whole scenario

438
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:57,810
带了一把
by bringing what I can only assume

439
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:00,361
貌似是无证手枪来到这公共场所
is an unlicensed firearm into this public place,

440
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:02,682
威胁到这些无辜人的人身安全
endangering the lives of all these innocent people,

441
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:05,650
凭良心 我就不能再一走了之
I can no longer, in good conscience, walk away

442
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,529
去停车场给谁撸管了
and jerk anyone off in the parking lot.

443
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:09,808
我哪儿也不去
I'm afraid we ain't going anywhere.

444
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,166
你该滚出去了
It's time for you to get out of here, pal.

445
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:12,805
喂喂
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

446
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,443
我们有四个人呢
There's four of us, tough guy.

447
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,611
这我知道
Yeah. I got that.

448
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:20,961
在我们动手之前, 你们要了解我一点.
All right. Before this whole thing goes down, you should know one thing about me.

449
00:21:19,864 --> 00:21:21,074


450
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,121
什么
What's that?

451
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:27,530
我讨厌仗势欺人
I don't like bullies.

452
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,041
我们走 杰
Let's go, Jet.

453
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,360
好
Yes.

454
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:46,366
天啊 但愿他是天主教徒
Oh, my God! I hope he's Catholic.

455
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:50,885
我的天啊
Oh, my God!

456
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:52,525
刚才咋回事
What the hell was that?

457
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:54,569
鲍勃 你太厉害了 我从未见过这种身手
Bob, that was amazing! I've never seen anything like that!

458
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,404
你抓住一个人 这样打了他一下
You took the one guy, you hit him like this.

459
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:57,721
他都喘不过气来
He couldn't breathe.

460
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,331
我坐在那里看着他…
I sat there, I'm looking at him...

461
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:00,720
你对他说：我讨厌仗势欺人
You talkin' to him like, "I don't like bullies."

462
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,490
我想：这话不够霸气 但很霸气
I was like, "That's not a good line." But it was!

463
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:03,641
没想到你会打架
I didn't even know you could fight!

464
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:06,571
你穿着独角兽衫 系着腰包 完全搭配
You had a unicorn shirt, a fanny pack, and it totally worked!

465
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:08,922
你就像杰森·伯恩 只不过穿着牛仔短裤
You were like Jason Bourne, man, but with jorts!

466
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:11,401
你怎么做到的 哪里学的武术
How did you do that? Where'd you learn that stuff?

467
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,409
我工作时学过几课
I took a couple classes at work.

468
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:14,931
希望下手没有太重
I hope I didn't go too far.

469
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:16,206
杰, 抱歉让你扫兴了
I'm sorry about ruining the night, Jet.

470
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:19,250
扫兴?不 这是最尽兴的事
Ruin my night? No! It was the coolest thing ever, man!

471
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,851
- 真的吗  - 是的
- Really? - Yes!

472
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,321
看着我兄弟收拾那些混蛋
To see my boy go in and whoop ass on those idiots back there.

473
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:24,641
这太爽了
Dude, that was amazing!

474
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,723
慢着 我们是兄弟?
Wait, we're boys?

475
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:28,441
是啊 我们是兄弟
Yeah, we boys.

476
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,127
哇 我…
Wow. I...

477
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,001
从没有过兄弟
Never had a boy.

478
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:38,847
- 这太好了来  - 等等
- That's awesome! Come here! - Oh, wait.

479
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,524
别 你这是干什么
Stop. What's going on, man?

480
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:43,284
- 我喜欢拥抱! - 你再干什么?
- I'm a hugger! - What're you doing?

481
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:47,729
我有个点子 我们走吧 这是我的摩托车
Hey! I got an idea. Let's roll. Here's my bike.

482
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,041
等等 这是你的摩托车?
Wait. That's your bike?

483
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,929
是的 川崎800
Yeah. Kawasaki 800!

484
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,525
我知道是什么车型
I know what the bike is.

485
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:55,404
我在高中时也有这么一辆
I had the same bike in high school, man.

486
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,204
- 你还骑吗  - 不
- You still ride? - No, man.

487
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:58,361
我多年没骑摩托车了
I haven't ridden a bike in years!

488
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,800
来吧 我们走
Come on, let's roll.

489
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,485
哪儿 你要去哪儿
Where? Where you trying to go?

490
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:07,451
我知道一个很合适的地方 走吧
I know the perfect spot. Come on, Jet.

491
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,970
去就去 去就去
You know, why not? Why not?

492
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:12,327
经过刚才… 好的
After this... Yeah, okay!

493
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:13,801
我们走
Let's roll.

494
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:19,003
喂喂 鲍勃 慢点 慢点
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hey, Bob! Slow, slow, slow!

495
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:20,641
鲍勃 喂 喂
Bob, hey, hey!

496
00:23:22,987 --> 00:23:26,240
中央高中

497
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:29,849
天啊 恍如隔世啊
God, this is so crazy, man.

498
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,729
让人想起太多往事
This brings back so many memories.

499
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:34,121
是啊 加尔文
I don't know, CJ.

500
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:35,850
我的高中生活很艰难
I mean, high school wasn't easy for me, man.

501
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,685
不知你是否知道, 我在高中时没几个朋友.
I don't know if you know this, but I didn't have many friends back then.

502
00:23:37,126 --> 00:23:38,795


503
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:40,481
什么
What?

504
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:42,690
真的吗
- Really? - No.

505
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:43,887
我还以为…
I don't know why I thought...

506
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:45,371
是真的
True story.

507
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:48,364
我本以为高中就像"十六支蜡烛"
Man, I thought high school was gonna be like Sixteen Candles

508
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:50,329
而我就像莫丽·林沃德
and I was gonna be like Molly Ringwald.

509
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,971
虽然开始时困难重重, 但到最后...
Sure, things were difficult in the beginning, but then, by the end...

510
00:23:51,599 --> 00:23:52,934


511
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,366
一切都很美满
everything worked out.

512
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:56,602
杰克·莱恩开着红色保时捷去接她
And Jake Ryan picked her up in that red Porsche.

513
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:57,841
哇
What-what?

514
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:59,041
你看过那部电影吗
You ever see that movie?

515
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:02,368
我是黑人 所以我不知道…
I'm black, so I don't know the...

516
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:04,204
你一定要看看
You gotta see it, dude.

517
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:07,364
很经典 是我最喜欢的电影
Total classic. It's my favorite all-time movie.

518
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:10,649
但后来我发现高中生活完全不像"十六根蜡烛"
Then I realized high school was nothing like Sixteen Candles.

519
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:13,723
我也永远不会像莫丽·林沃德那样
And I'll never be like Molly Ringwald.

520
00:24:13,913 --> 00:24:15,540
男更衣室

521
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,484
这要看对谁了
Yeah, well, depends on who you ask.

522
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:19,205
对我来说…
That's the thing. For me, I...

523
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:21,881
怎么了
What's going on?

524
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:24,320
哇
Oh, wow.

525
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:27,804
我想说 我很同情
Hey, man, I just wanna say that I'm really sorry

526
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:30,406
当时特雷弗几个人那么欺负你
about what Trevor and those guys did to you back then.

527
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:40,050
没什么 我很少想起那件事
No biggie. I don't even think about it anymore. No.

528
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:41,841
那好
Okay, good.

529
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,730
我的办法是
Yeah. Here's the secret. You know what I did, Jet?

530
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:46,326
我把这件事
I took all that stuff and I balled it up real tight

531
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:49,006
深深压在心底
and then I shoved it way down deep.

532
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,522
就当没发生过
And I just pretty much ignore it.

533
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:54,725
这听起来很不健康 鲍勃
You know, that sounds really unhealthy, Bob.

534
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,240
喂 我得说
Hey, I gotta tell you.

535
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,050
你是那天唯一帮我的人
You were the only one who helped me out that day.

536
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:59,890
还记得吗
In the gym? Remember that?

537
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:02,407
你把你的优秀运动员外套给了我
And you gave me your letterman's jacket!

538
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:05,649
你别介意 那件外套你一直没还给我
Hey, not for nothing, but I never got that jacket back, man.

539
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,081
呃!
Huh!

540
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:09,049
真的吗 奇怪
Really? Strange.

541
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:12,561
我想谢谢你那天对我的帮助.
Hey, but listen, I just wanna thank you for what you did for me that day.

542
00:25:11,471 --> 00:25:12,680


543
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,006
很仗义 杰
That was really cool of you, Jet.

544
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:16,083
得了 那是应该做的
Stop, man. It was the right thing to do, you know?

545
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:20,167
- 告诉你一件奇事  - 什么事
- You wanna hear something weird? - What?

546
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:22,049
后来我再没裸体过
I have not been naked since that day.

547
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:23,531
没在任何人面前裸体过
I mean, not in front of anyone.

548
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:25,001
从没
Never.

549
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:26,730
难道这20年来
So, you're telling me that for the last 20 years,

550
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:28,763
从没有人见过你光着身子?
you've never been seen in your birthday suit?

551
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,689
- 没有  - 那你打炮的时候呢
- No. - So, what about when you have sex?

552
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:33,242
都是在漆黑的夜里 就像范·迪塞尔那样
I keep it pitch-black, just like Vin Diesel.

553
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:34,801
什么
What?

554
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,811
我一直不知道特雷弗后来怎么样了
You know I've been wondering, whatever happened to Trevor anyway?

555
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:41,691
他有没有被车撞死 被狗咬死
Did he get hit by a bus or ripped apart by dogs

556
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,888
或者被人慢慢折磨死?
or die slowly of anything?

557
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:47,880
没有 他现在是个大投资银行家
No. No, no. He's a bigtime investment banker downtown.

558
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,687
- 噢 不错  - 是啊
- Oh, hey, cool. - Yeah.

559
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:52,171
混的不赖
Good for him, man.

560
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:55,086
鲍勃 如果你有什么心里话 你说就是
Hey, Bob, look, if you ever wanna talk, I'm here.

561
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:57,210
我不会介意
So I don't mind, you know?

562
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:58,767
完全不介意 如果你有…
I don't mind at all, if you wanna...

563
00:25:58,920 --> 00:25:59,921
不会吧
What?

564
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:03,084
哇
Whoa.

565
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:06,167
这是我们那一学年的各种纪念品
This is all our stuff from our year!

566
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:09,164
是啊 肯定是在为明晚的同学聚会做准备
Yeah. Must be getting ready for the reunion tomorrow night.

567
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:10,367
我们走吧
Come on, man. Let's get out of here.

568
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:12,727
不 看 到处都有你
What? No! "Get out..." Look, you're all over this!

569
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:16,242
篮球 棒球 越野赛
Look at this. Basketball, baseball, cross country.

570
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,640
哈姆雷特
Hamlet.

571
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:18,841
舞会国王
Prom King.

572
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,570
这是达拉·莫佳肯
There's Darla McGuckian.

573
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:22,649
花样游泳 真性感
Synchronized swimming, that's so sexy.

574
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:25,366
这里简直就是黄金喷气机的吉尼斯纪录大全
This is like the Guinness Book of Golden Jet Records right there.

575
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:27,960
我看到了
I see that.

576
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:31,607
说实话 我已经认不出当年的自己了
To be honest with you, I don't even recognize this guy anymore.

577
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:33,850
当年的这个人
This guy, here, he was gonna...

578
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,889
他打算去征服世界
He was gonna conquer the world.

579
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,044
如果1 8岁的我看到了现在的我
If 18-year-old me could see me now,

580
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:40,924
会觉得我完全是个废物
he'd probably think I was a total loser.

581
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:44,123
什么 别胡说
What? That's crazy talk!

582
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:45,805
- 你是黄金喷气机  - 别说了
- You're The Golden Jet, dude! - Stop.

583
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:48,804
别说了 别跟我提黄金喷气机了
Stop, Bob. Spare me with The Golden Jet shit.

584
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,682
我不是黄金喷气机了 我是个会计
I'm not The Golden Jet, man. I'm an accountant.

585
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:53,245
这就是我现在
That's my reality.

586
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:59,204
本以为我有更远大的命运
I just thought I was meant for more, you know?

587
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:01,882
我的一生会与众不同
My life would be something special.

588
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:06,451
俗话说每个人都是自己生命故事里的英雄
You know how they say every man is the hero of his own story?

589
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:08,721
是出自"暮光之城"吗
Was that in Twilight?

590
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:12,045
不 不是出自那里
No, I don't think that's where it's from.

591
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:14,248
不过那套丛书很棒 吸血鬼
But those books are cool, right? Vampires!

592
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:16,442
还有个狼人
And there's a wolf-boy.

593
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:21,401
我说的不是暮光之城 好吗
I'm not... I'm not talking about Twilight, Bob, okay?

594
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:22,721
我说的是 我感觉不到
I'm talking about the fact that I don't feel like

595
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,644
我是自己故事里的英雄
I'm the hero of my own story. That's...

596
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,450
你故事里的英雄当然是你了
How are you not the hero of your own story?

597
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:28,045
不可能是别人
No one else can be!

598
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,964
加尔文 我得对你说实话
Yo, CJ, I gotta be honest with you, man.

599
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:31,645
你说你感觉
I mean, all this talk about Calvin Joyner

600
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:33,040
自己不是英雄
not feeling like he's a hero...

601
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,725
这是胡说
That's crazy talk, man.

602
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:36,844
不 不是的
No. No, it's not.

603
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,570
你是我在高中最美好的回忆
You were the best thing about high school.

604
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:40,411
我一直相信你行
I'll always believe in you.

605
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:42,881
还记得你经常做的后空翻吗
Yo, do you remember those backflips you used to do?

606
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:45,284
观众一片惊呼 我也亲眼所见
The crowd would go crazy! I was there, too.

607
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:47,442
我就想天啊 他是怎么做到的
I was, like, "What? How's he do that?"

608
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:48,687
你是怎么做到的
How did you do that?

609
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:52,244
不知道 就是会
I don't know. I just did it, man.

610
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:53,921
没错
Exactly.

611
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:55,081
现在做一个
So, do it now.

612
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:58,884
不不 你疯了 不
No, no. You're crazy! No.

613
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,281
什么声音
What's that?

614
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:01,487
什么什么声音
What're you talking about? What's what?

615
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:03,244
- 黄金喷气机  - 省省吧
- Golden Jet! - No, stop it.

616
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:05,164
- 黄金喷气机  - 别说了
- Golden Jet! - Okay, stop it!

617
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:06,845
- 黄金喷气机  - 好了
- Golden Jet! - All right.

618
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,331
黄金喷气机
Golden Jet!

619
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:11,370
不来个后空翻我就一直喊下去
I'm not gonna stop until you do The Golden Jet flip!

620
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:12,521
黄金喷气机
Golden Jet!

621
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:14,921
好了 大家安静一下 安静一下
All right, everybody, settle down. Settle down!

622
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:17,606
既然大家都想看我后空翻
If the crowd wants a Golden Jet flip,

623
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,489
我就给大家来个后空翻
then they gonna get a Golden Jet flip.

624
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:20,766
来吧
You go, girl!

625
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:26,689
啊 天啊
Oh, God!

626
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:28,205
差点就成了 杰
That was so close, Jet.

627
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:30,801
哥们 来
Here, buddy. Come on.

628
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,570
肯定地板刚打过蜡
They must have just waxed these floors.

629
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,604
这绝对是第一次
That was definitely a first, man.

630
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,485
天 我都精疲力尽了
Oh, man, I am beat.

631
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:42,041
噢
Oh.

632
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:45,087
喂 杰
Hey, Jet!

633
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:48,682
我今晚非常开心
Man, I had a great time tonight.

634
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:49,841
哇
Whoa!

635
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,482
我也非常开心
You know what? I had a good time, too, man.

636
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,085
感觉这正是我需要的
I feel like I needed this, you know?

637
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,447
是啊 我也是
Yeah. Yeah. Me, too!

638
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:57,961
谢谢你
Thank you.

639
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:00,561
不客气 朋友 不客气
My pleasure, amigo. Any time.

640
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:04,122
如果有用得着我的地方 一句话就行
Hey, if there's ever anything I can do for you, just say the word.

641
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:06,806
哇 这是真心话吗
Wow. You really mean that?

642
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:08,367
是的
Yeah.

643
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:11,330
我本来不想说的 那我就说了吧
I wasn't gonna bring it up, but I might as well.

644
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:14,649
最近我的工资账户出了点问题
Lately, I've been having this problem with my payroll account. And...

645
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:16,521
全搞乱了
It's all screwed up, somehow.

646
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:20,083
我被解雇之前 曾在海外工作过一段时间
You know, I was overseas working for a while before I got fired.

647
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:23,164
所以这是个法务会计方面的事
So, it's kinda like a forensic international account thingy

648
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:26,569
这方面是你的专长吧
which, I think, is kind of your specialty, right?

649
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:28,601
呃
Um...

650
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,800
是的 我会帮你看看
Yeah, no, it is. I'll take a look at that for you.

651
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,161
真的吗 你能帮我这个忙?
You would? You would do that for me?

652
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:36,846
我有登录资料 如果你能打开你的电脑
I've got the login info, if you wanna crack open your computer,

653
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:38,280
我们就能开始了
we can do this!

654
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,290
你是说现在?
Oh, you mean now?

655
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:42,568
- 那就太好了! - 好.
- That's awesome! Yeah! - Okay.

656
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,404
- 看啊  - 喂 鲍勃
- Look at this! - Hey, Bob...

657
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:45,607
哇
Whoa!

658
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:47,006
鲍勃 你得小点声
Bob, you gotta keep your voice down!

659
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,286
麦吉在睡觉
Maggie's sleeping.

660
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,441
哇
Wow.

661
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:54,323
这可是很复杂的国际会计资料啊
This is a pretty serious international account dossier you've got here.

662
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:57,649
是啊 我只希望一切都搞得明明白白
Right? I just want to make sure everything was hunky-dory.

663
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,809
去你的路由器
Going to your router.

664
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:06,406
现在你跟我对话了
Now you're talking to me.

665
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:09,962
好了 我进去了
Bingo. I'm in.

666
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:12,767
很好 杰 谢谢你
Oh. That's great, Jet. Thank you, man!

667
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,482
乍一眼看上去
I mean, just looking at it first-hand,

668
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:21,962
就像是一些海外代管账户
it kinda looks like it's a bunch of off-shore escrow accounts.

669
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:23,645
由于某些原因
These have been backwashed into

670
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:26,889
被转回到一些国内虚拟账户
a series of domestic dummy accounts for some reason.

671
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:29,611
登记地点五花八门 有中国的
I mean, the logs are all crazy, too. You have China,

672
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,845
叙利亚的 伊朗的
Syria, Iran.

673
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:34,685
这是个拍卖站点 鲍勃
This is an auction site, Bob!

674
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,604
这是竞标 这些都是
These are bids. All of these.

675
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:40,331
这里有亿万美元的竞标
This is hundreds of millions of dollars in bids, right here.

676
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:43,411
从这个表上看, 拍卖明天就结束.
And judging by this clock, here, it says it's all gonna end tomorrow.

677
00:30:42,010 --> 00:30:43,511


678
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:44,767
哇
Whoa!

679
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:47,969
怎么回事 为什么
- What the hell? Why? - What did...

680
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:49,565
对不起 杰
- Oh! I'm sorry, Jet! - Bob!

681
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:52,405
杰 真对不起 天
Jet, I'm so sorry! Oh, man.

682
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:54,847
- 我笨手笨脚的  - 我的电脑
- I'm all thumbs. - It's my computer!

683
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:56,565
- 对不起  - 你别管 鲍勃
- I'm sorry. - No! Please, Bob.

684
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:57,926
- 对不起  - 你别管 我来
- I'm sorry, Jet. - Leave it. I got it.

685
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:00,487
没关系 鲍勃没关系 你别管
It's fine, Bob. It's fine. Just leave it.

686
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:01,801
太糟糕了
The worst!

687
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:03,241
天
God!

688
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:06,041
喂 那个站点上是什么
Hey! What the hell was that on that site?

689
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,770
跟工资可没什么关系
That didn't have anything to do with payroll.

690
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:10,282
我不知道 我从没见过
I don't know. I've never seen that before.

691
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:11,441
真是疯狂
That was crazy.

692
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:13,881
等我们明天醒酒之后再研究吧
Let's figure it out tomorrow when we're bright-eyed and bushy-tailed.

693
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:16,361
怎么样 加尔文 我很疲倦了
What do you say, CJ? I am beat.

694
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:18,525
我能不能在你家睡一觉
Hey, do you mind if I crash here?

695
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:20,646
呃
Um...

696
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:22,721
可以
No.

697
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:26,129
我去拿条毛毯
Let me go grab some blankets.

698
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:33,241
谢谢你的睡衣 杰
Hey, thanks for the jammies, Jet.

699
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:37,171
好的 你可以留着
Okay, well, you can keep those.

700
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:39,129
这衣服是你的了
Those are... Those are officially yours.

701
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:41,971
是的
Yeah.

702
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,609
- 好啊 - 哦.
- All right. - Oh.

703
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:46,930
你还要系着腰包睡觉
You gonna sleep with your fanny pack.

704
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:50,004
黄金喷气机 是的 这是我的宝贝
Golden Jet! Yeah, it's my baby.

705
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:04,809
你还需要别的吗
You need anything else? You're okay?

706
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:10,162
想不到我正在加尔文·乔伊纳家里过夜
I can't believe I'm having a sleepover at Calvin Joyner's house right now.

707
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:12,840
太让我震惊了
This is blowing my mind!

708
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:15,321
好吧
Okay.

709
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:16,881
晚安 鲍勃
Uh, good night, Bob.

710
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:19,041
晚安 杰
Good night, Jet.

711
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:39,801
我?
Me?

712
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:41,726
是的 你
Yeah, you.

713
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:48,890
什么
What the fuck?

714
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:53,000
等一下
One second.

715
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:58,926
等等
Hold on.

716
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,447
有什么事吗
Uh, may I help you?

717
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:06,125
乔伊纳先生 我叫帕梅拉·哈里斯
Mr. Joyner, my name is Pamela Harris,

718
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:08,567
我是中情局的
I'm with the Central Intelligence Agency.

719
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:11,087
你接触过这个人吗
Have you had any contact with this man?

720
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:14,331
是的 他正在我的沙发上睡觉
Uh, yeah, he's on my... He's on my couch, sleeping.

721
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:15,481
目标在房子里
Target's in the house.

722
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:17,887
怎么了 怎么了 喂
What's going on? Hey!

723
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:20,486
喂 喂
Excuse me. Excuse me!

724
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,247
目标已逃走
Target's fled.

725
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:27,001
该死
Shit.

726
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:28,366
目标出去了
Target's on the move.

727
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:29,601
喂 怎么…
Excuse me! What...

728
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:35,609
喂 喂
Hello, hey! Excuse me!

729
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:37,848
- 还有附近的闲谈  - 喂 喂
- ...and voice chatter in the vicinity. - Hello! Excuse me!

730
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,241
如果再让他跑了 就拿你是问 去吧
If he's in the wind again, it's gonna be your ass. Go now.

731
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:42,562
- 喂  - 通知中情局总部 未抓到目标
- Hello! - Alert Langley, asset uncontained.

732
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:43,926
喂
Excuse me!

733
00:33:43,942 --> 00:33:45,944


734
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:45,882
- 有什么事吗  - 喂
- Can I help you? - Hello!

735
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:47,320
这是我的房子 出什么事了吗
It's my house. Is something going on?

736
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:49,926
乔伊纳先生 在你家过夜的好友 怪鸡鸡鲍勃
Well, Mr. Joyner, your sleepover buddy, Robert Wheirdicht,

737
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:53,562
又名鲍勃·斯通 又名黄金鲍勃 又名喷气机鲍勃
AKA Bob Stone, AKA Bob Golden, AKA Bob Jet,

738
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:55,729
因为杀人罪和叛国罪被通缉
is wanted for murder and treason

739
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:58,531
他目前持有国家高级机密
and is presently in possession of highly classified state secrets

740
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:00,404
打算卖给我们的敌人
which he intends to sell to our enemies.

741
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:01,647
什么
What?

742
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:05,600
如果被他得逞 将会引发一系列的国际事件
And if he succeeds, it's gonna spark a chain reaction of geopolitical events

743
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:06,921
最严重的可能
that most of our predictive models

744
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:09,845
将会引发第三次世界大战 甚至是世界末日
place somewhere between World War III and outright Armageddon.

745
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,321
所以肯定是出事了
So, yeah, I guess you could say something is going on.

746
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:13,721
可以吗
Oh, you mind?

747
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:18,011
冰箱里有奶精 什么
Creamer's in the fridge. What?

748
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:19,690
我不需要它
I don't need it.

749
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:21,729
我需要的只是信息
What I do need is information.

750
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:24,724
我要知道你和斯通特工
I need you to tell me everything and anything

751
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:26,644
接触时的所有细节
about your contact with Agent Stone.

752
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:30,126
- 斯通特工?  - 鲍勃 你的朋友鲍勃
- Agent Stone? - Bob, your friend Bob.

753
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:32,089
镇定一下 拜托
Come on. Stay with me, please.

754
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:35,322
我想肯定是误会了
Okay, I think there's a misunderstanding.

755
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:37,642
不 他不是我的朋友
No. No, he is not my friend.

756
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:40,761
那他为什么在"紧急联络人"中填的是你的名字
Then why did he list you as his emergency contact in all his personnel forms?

757
00:34:39,581 --> 00:34:40,706


758
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:42,121
什么
I'm sorry... He what?

759
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:44,806
鲍勃·斯通没有兄弟姐妹 没有父母 没任何亲人
Bob Stone has no siblings, or parents, or family of any kind.

760
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:48,607
你是他在个人资料中提到的唯一一个人
You are the only person he listed in his personal references.

761
00:34:46,379 --> 00:34:48,590


762
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,040
哦
Oh...

763
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:52,646
这是胡闹 我对他毫不了解
That's crazy, all right? I barely even know the guy.

764
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,086
那他为什么睡在你家沙发上
Then why was he sleeping on your couch?

765
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:55,446
因为我们昨晚出去喝酒了
Because we went out and had drinks last night.

766
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:57,250
你和不是朋友的人一起喝酒?
Oh, so you went out drinking with your non-friend?

767
00:34:58,440 --> 00:34:59,441
好吧
Okay.

768
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:01,451
好吧 我们… 你…
All right, let's... You're not...

769
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:02,967
暂停
Time out.

770
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:04,571
我按下暂停键
I'm pressing the time out button.

771
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:08,167
你们闯进我家 我是纳税人
Okay? You guys barged in my house. I pay my taxes.

772
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:11,603
你们休想拿我当敌人对待 好吗
So you're not gonna come here and treat me like I'm the enemy, okay?

773
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,888
这是首先要说明的 另外 如果你想知道真相
That's the first thing. Now, if you want to get into facts...

774
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:15,650
想谈谈真相
You wanna talk about facts?

775
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:16,841
这就要怪"脸谱"了
This is Facebook's fault.

776
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,001
你熟悉脸谱吗
Are you familiar with Facebook?

777
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:19,207
在我们监视之下
We surveil it.

778
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:20,930
他申请加我好友
He sent me a friend request.

779
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:22,525
就引发了这些事
That's how this whole thing started.

780
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:23,801
你就接受了?
And you accepted?

781
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:26,249
别这么做 别这么对我
Don't do that. Don't do that to me.

782
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:29,768
给我一点反应时间 别这么快反诘
You give me a second. Okay? Don't fire back like that.

783
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:32,048
首先 这都怪马克·扎克伯格
First of all, fuck Mark Zuckerberg, all right?

784
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:34,567
我之所以接受 因为这是脸谱
Now, I accepted because it was Facebook.

785
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:37,206
不接受的话没礼貌 我不知道申请加我好友的人
And it's rude when you don't accept it and I don't know if the person on the other end

786
00:35:36,054 --> 00:35:37,347


787
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:39,721
能不能看到我拒绝 所以我就接受了
can see me not accept it. That's why I accepted.

788
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,370
你紧张吗 乔伊纳先生
Are you nervous, Mr. Joyner?

789
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:42,727
是不是很热
Is it hot?

790
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,769
你热不热 我很热
Are you getting hot? Because I'm getting hot.

791
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:46,251
我不脱外套
I'm not gonna take off my jacket

792
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,050
因为那样显得我心虚
because that makes me look guilty.

793
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:50,601
你们就是要找有罪的人
And that's what you guys look for. Hmm?

794
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,367
有罪的人是不是都会心虚
Is this what a guilty man would do?

795
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:55,921
看我多淡定
Look how comfortable I am.

796
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:59,086
我靠在柜台上 一滴汗也没有
I'm gonna lean up against this counter, and I'm not gonna sweat.

797
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:03,566
完全没有一点心慌的表情
I'm not gonna... I'm not gonna look flustered at all.

798
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:05,603
放马来吧
I'm... Bring it.

799
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:07,246
你想问什么
What you want to know?

800
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:08,607
嗯?
Hmm?

801
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:09,921
- 乔伊纳先生  - 什么
- Mr. Joyner. - Yeah.

802
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:11,923
鲍勃·斯通是个危险的疯子
Bob Stone is a dangerous psychotic.

803
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:14,242
- 你还活着是命大  - 听我说
- You're lucky to be alive. - Okay, listen to me.

804
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:17,250
哈里斯特工 我不认识这个人
Agent Harris, I don't know this man.

805
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:19,090
他只是我高中时的一个古怪同学
He's just a little weird kid that I knew in high school.

806
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:20,805
他以前曾把米花糖放在我的衣物柜里
He used to put Rice Krispies Treats in my locker.

807
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:22,291
我有时吃 有时不吃
Sometimes I ate 'em, sometimes I didn't.

808
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:26,009
我当时不喜欢吃零食 因为怕屁股上长肉
I wasn't in carbs back then 'cause I didn't want that weight going to my hips.

809
00:36:24,185 --> 00:36:26,146


810
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:28,441
男人不喜欢屁股大 尤其是在高中
As a man, you don't want big hips, especially in high school.

811
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:31,081
总之 我跟他没任何瓜葛
Bottom line, I have no allegiance to this man.

812
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:32,810
没任何关系
Zero ties, okay?

813
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,161
所有关系都切断
All ties are cut.

814
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:36,288
我被我切断了 就是你和我
I cut them, so this is me and you.

815
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:38,444
所以别把我和他…
So don't put me and him...

816
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:41,002
这跟我没关系
I ain't in this shit, okay?

817
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:44,087
好吧 乔伊纳先生 你证明一下
All right, Mr. Joyner. Prove it.

818
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,564
我需要一点时间
Yeah, well, I need a second.

819
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:49,240
你要出去一下 我要大便
You gotta step outside. I gotta take a shit.

820
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:50,606
信息量很大
This is a lot.

821

00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:42,285
别这么做 别这么做
Don't do that. Don't do that.

912

Stop. Stop!

917
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:53,362
我现在就要求知道这是怎么回事
I need to know what is happening, right now.

918
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:55,522
好 问这个太早
Okay, okay. You know what? Moving too fast.

919
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:58,883
你要先回答 你参与还是不参与
Bottom line, are you in or you out?

920
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:00,886
参与不参与什么
What are you... In or out of what?

921
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:03,520
没时间问问题 只要回答
Mmm-mmm. No time for questions, just action.

922
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:05,762
- 参与还是不参与  - 好 那我不参与
- In or out? - Okay, then I'm out.

923
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,402
对不起 杰. 你已经参与了
I'm sorry, Jet. Actually, you're already in.

924
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:10,005
那你为什么还要问
Then why would you ask me?

925
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:11,969
因为我以为你会说：我参与 鲍勃
Because I thought you would go, "I'm in, Bob!"

926
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:14,971
然后我们兴高采烈一番, 但都被你扫兴了.
And we would've had a really cool moment, but you kinda ruined the whole thing.

927
00:41:13,558 --> 00:41:15,018


928
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:16,167
我扫兴…
I ruined...

929
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:17,401
好 好
Okay, okay, okay.

00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:18,971
听我说
Listen to me right now.

931
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:22,325
鲍勃 我不知道你参与了什么 但我只知道
Bob, I don't know what it is that you're into but what I do know is that

932
00:41:20,857 --> 00:41:22,275


933
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:26,371
我绝对彻底不参与
I am really, really 100% out!

934
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:27,521
你听见了吗
Do you understand that?

935
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:29,967
- 天啊 你真能装! - 什么?
- God, you are good! - What?

936
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:32,930
加尔文·乔伊纳你的话剧协会主席不是白来的
Calvin Joyner, president of the Drama Club for a reason, folks!

937

- You're like a snack-size Denzel. - Okay. Stop it, stop it, stop it.

938
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,211
不是跟你说着玩的
This is not a game.

939
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:39,885
我很认真
I'm being serious right now.

940
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:41,561
我不参与
I'm out!

941
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:45,326
好吧 好吧
Okay. Okay.

942
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:47,602
不得不说 我有几分失望
I can't say I'm not disappointed, Jet,

943
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:49,726
既然你不参与 就不参与吧

944
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:51,769

开诚布公的交流
openly and honestly.

947
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:58,810
这很能说明我们的关系
I think it says a lot about our relationship.

948
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:01,327
等等 你要干什么 天啊
Wait, hold up, wait. What're you doing? Oh, my God!

949
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:02,527
不过呢
Here's the thing, though.

950
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:04,205
你只有一种方式可以退出
There's only one way for you to get out.

951
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:05,486
什么方式
What's that?

952
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:06,846
你得先参与进来
You gotta get in first.

953
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:08,371
这是怎么…
What is it that...

954
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:09,806
- 什么, 什么! - 拿着我的枪, 杰.
- What-what! Take my gun, Jet.

955
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,525
我们可能要杀人
we may have to kill some people.

956
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:13,842
- 拿着吧 不咬人的  - 我不会做那种事
- Come on, it's not gonna bite you. - I will do no such thing.

957
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,001
我会喜欢的
I think you'll like it.

958
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:16,491
- 我不会的  - 你会需要它
- I will not! - You're gonna need it.

959
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:19,920
你才需要呢 他在这里
You're gonna need it! He's in here!

960
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:21,121
杰.
Jet.

961
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:23,851
他在那里 鲍勃在那里
He's in there! Bob's in there!

962
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,287
他有枪 他有枪
He's got a gun! He's got a gun!

963
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:30,164
- 都趴下  - 快快
- Down, down, get down! - Move, move, move!

964
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:32,001
我要用到你的表演才能
All right. I'm gonna need your improv skills.

965
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:33,161
什么
What?

966
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:35,806
- 扮演人质 准备好了吗  - 不
- Hostage role-play, you ready? - No!

967
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:37,610
- 来吧  - 我说了不
- Sweet, let's go. - No, I said no!

968
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:38,921
我说了不
I said no!

969
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:40,525
他抓了个人质
He's got a hostage!

970
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:42,561
不
No!

971
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:44,563
不 住手 你要害死我
No! Stop it, you gonna get me killed!

972
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:47,321
别开枪
Don't shoot!

973
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:00,961
好的 杰
There we go, Jet!

974
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:02,761
你要干什么
What are you doing?

975
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:04,001
我靠
Oh! Shoot!

976
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:06,841
别开枪
Don't shoot!

977
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:21,001
- 坚持住 杰  - 不 我什么都不干
- Hang tight, Jet! - No, I'm not doing anything!

978
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:22,690
别把我牵涉到你的事情里
Stop including me in your stuff!

979
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:26,250
打他 特工 用棍子打他
Get him, Agent! Hit him with the stick!

980
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:32,287
噢
Oh!

981
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:34,602
你做的很好, 杰. 等我一下就好, 好吗?
You're doing a great job, Jet. Just give me a second, okay?

982
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:35,807
搞什么
What the fuck?

983
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:37,841
他拿着咖啡罐
He got a coffee pot!

984
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:56,561
他拿着香蕉
He got a banana!

985
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:03,045
噢 噢
Oh! Oh!

986
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:05,246
不许动
Freeze!

987
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:18,289
杰 救我
Jet, help!

988
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:19,481
什么
What?

989
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:22,687
黄金喷气机 救我
Golden Jet, help.

990
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:23,966
不 我可不救你
No, man, I'm not helping you!

991
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,001
该死
Oh, shit.

992
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:29,846
- 给我枪  - 住手
- Give me the gun! - Stop it!

993
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,331
- 别反抗  - 我是让你放开我
- Stop resisting! - No, let me go!

994
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:37,082
放开我 我正要给你的
Let me go! I'm trying to give it to you!

995
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:41,406
该死
Oh, shit!

996
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:42,766
- 我不是故意的  - 别动
- That was an accident! - Don't move!

997
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:44,206
住手 听我说
No, stop! Listen to me!

998
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:47,921
我们走
Let's go.

999
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:50,091
等等 你干什么
Wait, wait! Come on! What are you... Ah!

1000
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:52,040
拜托
Come on, man!

1001
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:54,168
别再这么下去了
This has gotta stop! Okay?

1002
00:44:56,080 --> 00:44:57,127
该死
Shit!

1003
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:02,886
别开枪
Don't shoot!

1004
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:05,803
- 天啊  - 举起手来
- Oh, God! - Show us your hands!

1005
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:07,405
- 放下武器  - 快点
- Drop your weapon! - Do it now!

1006
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:17,081
啊
Ow.

1007
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:18,881
对不起 杰
Sorry, Jet.

1008
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:21,122
结束了 鲍勃 投降吧
It's over, Bob. Give up.

1009
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:22,890
你知道我不能投降 帕梅拉
You know I can't do that, Pam.

1010
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:24,883
你无处可逃了 斯通特工
There's nowhere to run, Agent Stone.

1011
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:26,726
就像在加拉加斯
Just like Caracas.

1012
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:31,251
如果你能像加尔文那样信任我 在加拉加斯本不会出事的
Uh, Caracas would've worked if you trusted me like Calvin trusts me.

1013
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:32,561
不 不
No. No.

1014
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:34,484
不是的 我并不信任他
That is not true. I do not trust him!

1015
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:36,722
完全不信任他 事实上
I do not trust him at all. As a matter of fact,

1016
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:38,285
现在正是澄清的好时机
this is a perfect time for us to clear this up

1017
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:40,442
尤其是在这对峙中 我就不该出现在这里
especially in the middle of this standoff. I shouldn't be here!

1018
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:43,171
我感觉自己淌了浑水
So I feel like me being in the middle of this throws me in it.

1019
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:44,651
让我把自己排除在外
So let me exclude myself.

1020
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:46,524
- 喂 别起来  - 不许动
- Hey, stay down! - Don't move!

1021
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:49,371
好 我留在里面 我留在里面
Okay, all right. I'll stay in. I'll stay in.

1022
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:51,607
我有个点子
I got a plan.

1023
00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:55,370
可能会让我们两人送死, 但如果成功了 那绝对是个传奇.
Might get us both killed but if it works, it'll be a totally boss story.

1024
00:45:53,714 --> 00:45:55,507


1025
00:45:55,560 --> 00:45:56,561
可以吗
Cool?

1026
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:58,688
- 不 不可以  - 可以
- No! No, it's not cool! - Cool.

1027
00:45:58,840 --> 00:46:00,001
不 我说的是不可以
No, I said it's not cool.

1028
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:01,685
我说的是不可以
I said it's not cool!

1029
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:03,001
时间到
Time's up.

1030
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:04,841
你说的对 帕梅拉
You're right, Pam.

1031
00:46:05,560 --> 00:46:06,641
我的时间到了
My time is up.

1032
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:08,848
三 二
In three, two,

1033
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:10,681
一
one.

1034
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:20,408
鲍勃 鲍勃
Bob, Bob, Bob!

1035
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:23,406
喂 喂
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1036
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:25,246
天啊
Oh, shit!

1037
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,001
哇
Whoo-hoo!

1038
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:45,729
哇 你感觉到了吗
Wow! Did you feel that, Jet?

1039
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:48,121
这可是勇气
That was the balls right there!

1040
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:51,446
喂 你尿裤子了吗
Hey, did you shit yourself a little bit?

1041
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:55,727
尿了也很正常 我不会看不起你
It's all right if you did. Totally cool. I don't judge.

1042
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:02,201
拉我出来
Get it off!

1043
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:03,681
你们要的车?
You guys order an Uber?

1044
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:07,561
你干什么
What are you doing?

1045
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:09,685
你最好快点上车
You better get your tuches in the car.

1046
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:10,841
否则要被打死了
You're gonna get shot!

1047
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:12,161
另射我 射他
Don't shoot me! Shoot him!

1048
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:14,846
射他 我不参与 我不参与
Shoot him! I'm out! I'm out! I'm out!

1049
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,241
让我进去 让我进去 鲍勃
Let me in! Let me in! Let me in! Go, Bob!

1050
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:23,085
喂 这是我的车
Hey, that's my car!

1051
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:24,761
你去死
Fuck you!

1052
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:26,969
给你个差评
You get zero stars!

1053
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,207
把话放出去
Put the word out to all assets.

1054
00:47:30,360 --> 00:47:31,930
捉拿鲍勃的悬赏加倍
I'm doubling the price on Bob's head.

1055
00:47:32,360 --> 00:47:33,930
喂 你搞什么
Hey, what the shit, honey...

1056
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:36,885
让拉里去办
Get Larry on it.

1057
00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:43,247
车 车
Car, car, car!

1058
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:45,609
是这样的 杰
All right, here's the dilly-o, Jet.

1059
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:47,410
大约三周前 一位国家的敌人
About three weeks ago, an enemy of the state

1060
00:47:47,560 --> 00:47:48,800
代号大黑獾
codenamed "The Black Badger"

1061
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:51,930
偷走了整个美国间谍卫星系统的加密密钥
stole the encryption keys to the entire US spy satellite program

1062
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:55,124
要在你昨晚电脑的拍卖网站上卖给一个买家.
which he's gonna sell to a buyer from that auction site on your computer last night.

1063
00:47:53,333 --> 00:47:55,210


1064
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:56,327
鲍勃
Bob...

1065
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:57,561
如果我们失去对间谍卫星的控制
If we lose control of our satellites,

1066
00:47:57,720 --> 00:48:00,530
会无力应对任何恐怖袭击
we're completely vulnerable to any terrorist attacks.

1067
00:48:00,680 --> 00:48:02,603
所以我要去你的办公室接上你
That's why I had to go back to your office and get you, Jet.

1068
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:04,524
我需要你高超的会计技巧
I need your super sweet accounting skills

1069
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:06,603
帮我查出谜团的最后一块拼图
to help me figure out the last piece of this puzzle

1070
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:09,001
也就是中标买家的交易号码
which is the transaction number from the winning bid.

1071
00:48:09,160 --> 00:48:11,049
我们就能知道交易地点了
That'll tell us where the deal is going down.

1072
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:15,048
这样 我们就能抓住大黑獾
That way, we can get The Black Badger.

1073
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:16,401
没你的帮助不行
I can't do it without you, Jet.

1074
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:19,127
开什么玩笑 我不会帮你
Are you kidding me? I'm not helping you.

1075
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:21,044
你用香蕉打了人
You attacked somebody with a banana.

1076
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:23,931
- 香蕉能增加伤害  - 什么
- A banana, force multiplier. - What?

1077
00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:26,162
我的意思是 手里不管拿着什么
Well, basically what that means is anything in your hand

1078
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:30,161
都比赤手空拳伤害大的多, 包括香蕉.
is far more dangerous than just your bare hands alone, including a banana.

1079
00:48:29,119 --> 00:48:30,120


1080
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:31,801
哦
Oh!

1081
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:35,008
哦
Oh! Ah!

1082
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:36,850
- 增加伤害  - 是的
- A force multiplier! - Yeah.

1083
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,490
原来是这样
Yeah, that's what it is.

1084
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:40,682
我现在明白多了
It makes so much more sense to me now.

1085
00:48:40,840 --> 00:48:43,047
这是中情局的基本技能
That's page-one CIA stuff.

1086
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:46,602
我差点忘了我是中情局出来的
I almost forgot that I wasn't in the fucking CIA!

1087
00:48:47,560 --> 00:48:48,686
停车
Stop the car.

1088
00:48:48,840 --> 00:48:50,729
马上停车 停车
You stop the car right now! Stop the car!

1089
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:52,769
好 好 这是好主意 杰
Okay, okay. That's a great idea, Jet.

1090
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:54,570
我们该摆脱追踪
We should get off the grid right now.

1091
00:48:55,880 --> 00:48:57,689
啊
Whoa!

1092
00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:04,682
好 这里没人
All right. We're clear.

1093
00:49:10,520 --> 00:49:11,681
好
Okay.

1094
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:14,362
好 我先深呼吸
Okay. Let's just take some deep breaths.

1095
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:16,045
好吗 深呼吸
Okay? Deep breaths.

1096
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:19,566
你只需要下车去
All you gotta do is get out of this car

1097
00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:23,291
跟鲍勃做一番理性的交谈 他就会理解的.
and have a rational conversation with Bob and he'll understand.

1098
00:49:21,839 --> 00:49:23,257


1099
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:34,884
鲍勃 我现在想回家去
Robert, I would like to go home now, please.

1100
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:36,724
哥们 我也想回去
Buddy, you and me both.

1101
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:39,121
但在我们洗刷名声之前 是没法回去的
But until we clear our names, there's no going home.

1102
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:41,487
抱歉 你最后一句能再说一遍吗
I'm sorry, can you clarify that last sentence for me?

1103
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:42,926
既然你现在参与了…
Yeah, well, now that you're in...

1104
00:49:43,120 --> 00:49:45,248
打住 我不参与
Let me stop you right there. I'm not in.

1105
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:47,084
我从没说过参与
I never said that I was in.

1106
00:49:47,240 --> 00:49:50,005
事实上 我清楚的记得我说过不参与
In fact, I expressly remember saying that I was out!

1107
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:51,241
我知道 但他们认为你参与了
I know, but they think you're in.

1108
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:52,801
我…
I am...

1109
00:49:53,320 --> 00:49:55,243
我不参与 不参与
I'm fucking out! I'm out!

1110
00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:56,401
- 还有什么可说的  - 我知道
- What's left to tell? - Hey, no, I get it.

1111
00:49:56,560 --> 00:49:58,244
- 我没参与  - 我只是说他们以为你参与了
- I'm not in! - I'm just saying they think you're in.

1112
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:01,370
我没参与 我没参与
- I'm not in! I am not in! - I get it.

1113
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:03,602
我没参与 我退出
I'm not in! I'm out!

1114
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:06,240
等一下 杰 我先解除GPS
One sec, Jet, just gotta disable the GPS.

1115
00:50:06,680 --> 00:50:07,681
你去哪儿了
Where did you...

1116
00:50:08,120 --> 00:50:09,451
你想到车下 好的
You wanna go under... That's fine!

1117
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:10,807
等一下
Wait a minute.

1118
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:11,961
你这是故意的吧
You did this on purpose, didn't you?

1119
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:15,647
这整件事都是你故意的
This whole thing was done on purpose.

1120
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:17,370
这是你的计划
This is your plan!

1121
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:19,249
你耍了我
You tricked me!

1122
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:21,687
这没关系 但我知道你耍了我
It's fine, but I know you tricked me.

1123
00:50:21,840 --> 00:50:23,285
- 耍了你?  - 你耍了… 喂
- Trick you? - You tricked... Hey, boy!

1124
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:25,568
你是怎么…
What? What'd you just...

1125
00:50:25,720 --> 00:50:26,801
我没耍你 是你提出要帮我
I didn't trick you, you offered to help me.

1126
00:50:27,320 --> 00:50:28,845
知道吗 哈里斯都告诉我了
You know what's funny? Harris told me.

1127
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:30,451
她什么都告诉我了
She told me everything, man.

1128
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:32,170
她说是你偷走了密码
She told me that you stole the codes.

1129
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:34,129
我跟你说说哈里斯 你不能相信她
Let me tell you something about Harris. You can't trust her.

1130
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:36,487
她已经试图把我搭档的死算在我头上
She's already trying to frame me for my partner's murder!

1131
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:38,604
- 你杀了你的搭档?  - 没有
- You killed your partner? - No.

1132
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:39,801
我不会这么做的
I would never do that.

1133
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:41,485
是大黑獾杀了我的搭档
The Black Badger killed my partner.

1134
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:43,569
我跟你解释一下 事情的经过是这样的
Let me explain to you something, dude. This is what happened.

1135
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:47,121
在大黑獾偷走卫星密码之后
After The Black Badger stole the satellite encryption codes,

1136
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:50,887
我和搭档菲尔在基辅一处顶楼豪宅找到了他
my partner Phil and I tracked him to a penthouse in Kiev.

1137
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:52,166
- 喂 菲尔  - 什么
- Hey, Phil. - Yeah.

1138
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:54,006
我们来世再见
I'll see you on the other side.

1139
00:50:55,320 --> 00:50:56,810
来世再见
See you on the other side.

1140
00:50:58,120 --> 00:50:59,645
好
All right.

1141
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:01,325
天 我喜欢这家伙
God, I love that guy.

1142
00:51:01,480 --> 00:51:02,845
他知道我们会来 设了陷阱
He knew we were coming, so he set a trap.

1143
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,048
喂 鲍勃 鲍勃
Hey, Bob! Bob!

1144
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:06,281
不
No!

1145
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:08,966
菲尔是我的搭档 我的队友
Phil was my partner, my teammate

1146
00:51:09,720 --> 00:51:11,484
- 我却救不了他  - 不
- and I couldn't save him. - No!

1147
00:51:14,320 --> 00:51:15,890
那很可怕 加尔文
It was awful, Cal.

1148
00:51:16,040 --> 00:51:17,485
从一开始就是个圈套
It was a setup, right from the get-go.

1149
00:51:19,080 --> 00:51:20,127
天
Damn, man.

1150
00:51:20,680 --> 00:51:21,841
大黑獾根本不在那里
The Black Badger was never there.

1151
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,287
本来上电梯的应该是我 而不是菲尔
I should've been the one on that elevator, not Phil.

1152
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:25,807
天啊
God.

1153
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,367
好 鲍勃 拜托
Okay. Bob, please...

1154
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:30,801
我求你了 你能放我回去吗
I'm begging you, man. Can you just let me go home?

1155
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:32,485
加尔文 我完全理解你
CJ, I totally understand.

1156
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:34,449
但现在 哈里斯特工和她的人
But right now, Agent Harris and her taskforce

1157
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:36,329
已经把你的家完全监视起来了
has that place surveilled up the yin-yang.

1158
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:38,050
她还找了职业杀手寻找我们
She's got contract killers looking for us.

1159
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:39,480
你的家不安全
Your place isn't safe.

1160
00:51:39,640 --> 00:51:41,324
天啊 麦吉
Oh, my God. Maggie.

1161
00:51:41,480 --> 00:51:43,687
麦吉 我要怎么保护麦吉
Maggie! What the hell am I supposed to do about Maggie?

1162
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:47,366
趴下 杰
Get down, Jet!

1163
00:51:56,600 --> 00:51:58,045
该死
Shit! Oh!

1164
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:00,001
当心 鲍勃
Look out, Bob!

1165
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,571
这是谁啊 是谁啊 鲍勃
Who the hell is that? Who is that? Bob?

1166
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:15,960
该死
Oh, shit.

1167
00:52:21,240 --> 00:52:22,241
拉里
Larry.

1168
00:52:25,320 --> 00:52:26,606
你不是退休了吗
Thought you retired.

1169
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:27,761
是的
I did.

1170
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:30,448
但你的悬赏很高 鲍勃 不问死活
But you're worth a lot of money, Bob, dead or alive.

1171
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:33,160
那你惨了 我还有帮手呢
Well, tough luck, because I've got back up.

1172
00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:34,401
是不是 杰
Ain't that right, Jet?

1173
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:38,281
杰
Jet!

1174
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:03,001
老公 我知道 对不起我晚了
Hey, baby. I know. I'm sorry I'm late.

1175
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:05,282
该死的科普林证词花的时间太长了
The stupid Koplin deposition ran long.

1176
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:07,442
我这就走 我们在家里见面
I'm leaving right now. I'll meet you at the house.

1177
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:08,806
不不 别回家
No, no, no! Don't go home!

1178
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:10,610
- 别回家  - 怎么了
- Don't go home! - Why? What's going on?

1179
00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:13,525
没什么 我也晚了
Nothing! Nothing. I'm just running late, too.

1180
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:16,126
我们直接去丹医生的办公室见面吧
So I was gonna say let's just meet at Dr. Dan's office.

1181
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:19,328
好吧 出什么事了吗
Yeah. Okay. Is everything all right?

1182
00:53:19,480 --> 00:53:21,801
没有 怎么了
Yeah! Yeah. Why?

1183
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:23,200
一切都好
Everything's fine.

1184
00:53:23,360 --> 00:53:25,522
你的声音就像"盗亦有道"结尾处的雷·利奥塔
Because you kind of sound like Ray Liotta at the end of Goodfellas.

1185
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:27,086
什么
What?

1186
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:30,368
真好笑 这的确是很好的类比
That's so funny, babe. That's such a good reference.

1187
00:53:30,560 --> 00:53:32,324
真是典型的麦吉
That's classic Mags right there.

1188
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:35,285
那好 你不会回家的吧
So, okay. So you're not gonna go home, right?

1189
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:36,720
好吧 我不回家
Okay, fine. I won't go home.

1190
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:38,245
我们在丹医生的办公室见面 一会见
I'll meet you at Dr. Dan's. See you soon.

1191
00:53:38,440 --> 00:53:39,566
好 再见
Okay. All right, bye.

1192
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:40,767
再见
All right, bye.

1193
00:54:03,880 --> 00:54:04,881
上车
Get in.

1194
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:25,961
我就坦白说了吧
I'm gonna address the elephant in the room.

1195
00:54:26,120 --> 00:54:29,442
首先 你们
Okay, first of all, you...

1196
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:32,444
我想向你们两位道歉
You guys, I want to say sorry to.

1197
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:36,161
其实事情的经过不是你们想的那样
Because what you're probably thinking is not what happened.

1198
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:37,367
我不是故意的
Accidents!

1199
00:54:37,720 --> 00:54:38,767
我知道你们想：
I know you're like,

1200
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:41,441
用枪砸了人 又射了人 怎么可能不故意
How can you accidentally pistol-whip somebody and shoot somebody?

1201
00:54:40,407 --> 00:54:41,408


1202
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:42,601
有这可能的
It can happen.

1203
00:54:42,760 --> 00:54:46,446
今天就证明了有这可能
Okay? Today is proof that it can happen. So...

1204
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:48,443
很高兴我把这话说出来了
I'm glad I got to get that off my chest.

1205
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:50,689
你放心 乔伊纳先生 我相信你
Relax, Mr. Joyner. I believe you.

1206
00:54:50,840 --> 00:54:52,729
好 谢谢你
Okay, thank you.

1207
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:55,451
相信我 我能看出你只是个害怕的要命的平头百姓
Trust me, I know a scared-shitless civilian when I see one.

1208
00:54:55,640 --> 00:54:56,880
不需要向我解释
You don't have to convince me.

1209
00:54:57,040 --> 00:54:59,805
被你看透了 我就是这样的人
You got him over here. That is me.

1210
00:54:59,960 --> 00:55:01,803
我现在一点不淡定
Right now, I'm not comfortable.

1211
00:55:01,960 --> 00:55:03,689
我吓得要命
Okay, I am scared, okay?

1212
00:55:03,840 --> 00:55:06,207
屎尿早就吓出来了
I don't have no shit in my system.

1213
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:08,368
如果我坐在马桶上 什么都出不来
If I sat down on a toilet, nothing's coming out.

1214
00:55:08,520 --> 00:55:09,681
屁都放不出来了
Farts or just air.

1215
00:55:16,320 --> 00:55:17,560
放屁就像激光的声音
It'd sound like lasers.

1216
00:55:17,720 --> 00:55:19,165
谢谢你的描述
Thank you for that description.

1217
00:55:19,720 --> 00:55:21,484
乔伊纳先生 我向你介绍一些情况
Mr. Joyner, let me explain something.

1218
00:55:21,640 --> 00:55:22,926
鲍勃上次的强迫心理评估显示
Bob's last forced psych eval

1219
00:55:23,080 --> 00:55:26,004
他能很快失去现实感
show a person rapidly losing his grip on reality.

1220
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:27,685
鲍勃痴迷于一个鬼魂
Bob became obsessed with a ghost,

1221
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:29,366
一个他自己想像出来的事物
a figment of his imagination,

1222
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:31,170
他称之为大黑獾
he started calling "The Black Badger."

1223
00:55:31,320 --> 00:55:33,322
这种痴迷导致他情绪不稳
This obsession led to an instability,

1224
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:36,165
最早是他的搭档菲尔三周前报告的
first reported by his partner, Phil, three weeks ago.

1225
00:55:36,320 --> 00:55:38,846
就在菲尔遇害之前
Just before Phil was killed in the field.

1226
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:40,206
你知道菲尔是怎么死的吗
Do you know how Phil died?

1227
00:55:40,360 --> 00:55:43,170
鲍勃说是被大黑獾害死的
Yeah, Bob told me that The Black Badger killed him.

1228
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:48,447
怎么了
What?

1229
00:55:49,360 --> 00:55:50,361
怎么了
What?

1230
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:54,286
乔伊纳先生 鲍勃·斯通就是大黑獾
Mr. Joyner, Bob Stone is The Black Badger.

1231
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:57,406
菲尔是鲍勃六年的搭档
Phil was Bob's partner of six years.

1232
00:55:57,560 --> 00:55:58,561
他的至交好友
His best friend.

1233
00:55:58,760 --> 00:56:01,047
- 我们来世再见  - 来世再见
- See you on the other side. - See you on the other side.

1234
00:56:02,040 --> 00:56:03,530
喂 鲍勃
Hey, Bob!

1235
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:05,967
在他偷走卫星密码后
After he stole the satellite encryption codes

1236
00:56:06,120 --> 00:56:07,281
鲍勃背叛了菲尔
Bob betrayed Phil.

1237
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:08,441
不
No!

1238
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:11,885
他杀了他来掩盖他的痕迹
He killed him to cover his tracks.

1239
00:56:15,880 --> 00:56:18,963
在这之后 鲍勃就变节了
And, after that, Bob went rogue.

1240
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:20,929
这就是菲尔唯一剩下的
This is all that's left of Phil.

1241
00:56:24,520 --> 00:56:27,205
这是黄色网站
Um, this is PornHub.

1242
00:56:27,960 --> 00:56:30,884
该死 该死 抱歉
Oh, shit, shit, shit. Sorry.

1243
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:32,721
给
There you go.

1244
00:56:33,360 --> 00:56:36,648
天啊 这我倒没想到
Oh! Oh, God! Oh, I didn't see that coming.

1245
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:38,526
天
Oh, man!

1246
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,162
- 他死的很惨  - 等一下
- It's a hell of a way to go. - Okay, wait a minute.

1247
00:56:42,320 --> 00:56:44,641
为什么鲍勃不自己卖了卫星密码
Why wouldn't Bob just go sell the satellite encryption codes himself?

1248
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:46,609
因为在黑市上的盲目投标情况下
Because in a black market blind-bidding situation,

1249
00:56:46,760 --> 00:56:48,410
买家和卖家相互并不认识
the buyer and the seller, they don't know each other.

1250
00:56:48,560 --> 00:56:50,961
他们需要拍卖网站来告诉他们在哪儿见面
They need the auction site to tell them exactly where to meet up

1251
00:56:51,120 --> 00:56:52,246
何时进行交易
and when to make the exchange.

1252
00:56:52,840 --> 00:56:55,923
拍卖网站的交易号码中有这些信息
The transaction number from the auction site gives them that,

1253
00:56:56,080 --> 00:56:58,082
这意味着鲍勃依然需要你
which means Bob still needs you.

1254
00:56:59,080 --> 00:57:02,561
所以我们就要演一出捉放曹
Which is why we find ourselves in a little catch-and-release scenario.

1255
00:57:00,214 --> 00:57:02,508


1256
00:57:02,760 --> 00:57:04,808
你是鲍勃唯一信任的人
You are the only one Bob trusts.

1257
00:57:05,600 --> 00:57:07,011
所以我们要让你执行任务
That's why we're putting you in the field.

1258
00:57:07,160 --> 00:57:09,049
你下次见到鲍勃
The next time you're with Bob,

1259
00:57:10,080 --> 00:57:11,764
就按这个按钮
press this button.

1260
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:13,285
我们就能抓住他
We're going to have him cold.

1261
00:57:19,560 --> 00:57:21,369
现在 去修复你的婚姻吧
Now, go take care of your marriage.

1262
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:24,444
还有一点 什么都别告诉你老婆
One more thing. Don't tell your wife shit.

1263
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:26,931
好
All right.

1264
00:57:28,840 --> 00:57:30,001
我不知道问题出在哪里
I just don't know what's wrong.

1265
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:33,928
我当初嫁的那个人 我在高中时认识的那个人.
I mean, the man that I married, the person I knew in high school,

1266
00:57:31,871 --> 00:57:33,873


1267
00:57:34,080 --> 00:57:38,210
充满了干劲和渴望
he was filled with drive and desire. I mean...

1268
00:57:38,360 --> 00:57:41,285
我们以前每天中午都溜出去在体育馆座位下亲热
We used to sneak off every lunch hour and make out under the gym bleachers.

1269
00:57:39,837 --> 00:57:41,297


1270
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:43,408
以前的他
Like, that guy, back then,

1271
00:57:43,600 --> 00:57:45,762
很有追求的
- he wanted things, you know? - Hmm.

1272
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:48,207
对不起我来晚了 找不到停车的地方
Hey, I'm sorry I'm late. I couldn't find parking.

1273
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:50,164
没关系 我们已经开始了
Hi, no, no, it's okay. We got started without you.

1274
00:57:50,360 --> 00:57:52,203
加尔文 这位是丹医生
Babe, Calvin, this is Dr. Dan.

1275
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:53,721
你好 加尔文
Hello, Calvin.

1276
00:57:53,880 --> 00:57:56,008
- 天啊  - 怎么了
- Oh, shit! - Oh, jeez. What's the matter?

1277
00:57:56,200 --> 00:57:58,441
- 天啊 躲在我身后  - 老公 怎么了
- Holy shit! Get behind me! - Honey... Calvin, what?

1278
00:57:58,600 --> 00:58:00,887
没事的 麦吉 放松
It's okay, Maggie. It's okay. Just relax.

1279
00:58:01,080 --> 00:58:03,367
这在治疗过程中是很正常的反应
This is a very common reaction in the therapeutic process.

1280
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:04,521
- 是吗  - 什么
- It is? - What?

1281
00:58:04,680 --> 00:58:05,681
是的 一点不错
It is. It absolutely is.

1282
00:58:05,840 --> 00:58:08,969
加尔文 这是个很安全的地方 请坐下
Calvin, this is a very safe place. Please, sit down.

1283
00:58:09,120 --> 00:58:10,929
- 这不是个安全的地方  - 不不 老公
- This is not a safe place! - No, no, no. Honey, it's a...

1284
00:58:11,080 --> 00:58:12,570
这绝对不是个安全的地方
No, this is most definitely not a safe place!

1285
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:14,529
我和我老婆这就走 我们走
Me and my wife are leaving. Let's go.

1286
00:58:14,680 --> 00:58:16,682
不 不 你要坐下
No, no, no! You are going to sit down,

1287
00:58:16,840 --> 00:58:19,810
我们要进行这治疗过程
and we are going to go through this therapeutic process...

1288
00:58:19,960 --> 00:58:21,849
- 是的  - 我们夫妻一起
- Yes. - ...together, as a couple.

1289
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:24,243
好吧 好吧
Um... Fine, fine, fine.

1290
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:25,890
坐下 谢谢
Sit down. Thank you.

1291
00:58:26,040 --> 00:58:27,087
好吧
Fine.

1292
00:58:27,240 --> 00:58:31,006
好 两位我们先从字词联想开始吧
Okay, guys. Why don't we start off with a little bit of word association?

1293
00:58:31,160 --> 00:58:32,207
好的
Okay.

1294
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:33,401
好期待
This is exciting.

1295
00:58:33,560 --> 00:58:35,528
我听说这能让夫妻敞开心扉
I've heard this can really open a couple up.

1296
00:58:36,280 --> 00:58:39,648
麦吉 我给你说个词
Uh, Maggie, I'm going to offer you a word,

1297
00:58:39,800 --> 00:58:43,691
你告诉我你联想到什么词
and you respond however you're moved to from here.

1298
00:58:43,840 --> 00:58:44,887
好
Okay.

1299
00:58:45,080 --> 00:58:46,320
- 黑  - 白
- Black. - White.

1300
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:47,970
- 水  -海洋
- Water. - Ocean.

1301
00:58:48,120 --> 00:58:50,361
- 阳光  - 愉悦
- Sunshine. - Happy.

1302
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,480
- 你真厉害 麦吉  - 真的吗
- I'm very impressed, Maggie. - Really?

1303
00:58:53,640 --> 00:58:54,926
你很合拍
You're very in tune.

1304
00:58:55,480 --> 00:58:56,891
我很合拍
I'm very in tune.

1305
00:58:57,040 --> 00:58:59,122
加尔文 接下来是你
Calvin, you're next.

1306
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:00,964
我不想做这个游戏
I do not want to do this.

1307
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:03,806
放松 加尔文 这个没有错误的回答
Relax, Calvin. There are no wrong answers.

1308
00:59:03,960 --> 00:59:04,961
上
Up.

1309
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:07,687
下
Down.

1310
00:59:08,280 --> 00:59:09,281
嗯
Mmm.

1311
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:11,406
嗯是什么意思
"Mmm." What is that?

1312
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:12,647
你在写什么
What're you writing in your book?

1313
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:14,131
- 没关系 别惊慌  - 我没惊慌
- It's fine. Don't freak out. - Nobody's freaking out.

1314
00:59:14,320 --> 00:59:15,970
我只是不明白是什么游戏规则
I just don't understand the rules to the game.

1315
00:59:16,120 --> 00:59:17,326
惊慌
Freaking out.

1316
00:59:18,280 --> 00:59:20,203
我们先换个话题
Let's switch gears for a second, okay?

1317
00:59:21,640 --> 00:59:23,324
麦吉 在做爱的时候
Maggie, during lovemaking,

1318
00:59:24,920 --> 00:59:28,003
你有没有在加尔文的菊花里塞过东西
have you ever placed anything inside of Calvin's anus?

1319
00:59:28,160 --> 00:59:29,491
你说什么
What the hell did you just say?

1320
00:59:29,640 --> 00:59:31,529
是的 有过一次
Well, yeah, there was this one time.

1321
00:59:31,680 --> 00:59:33,887
- 你还记得"权力的游戏"最后一集吗  - 你说什么呢
- You remember? Game of Thrones finale. - What are you talking about?

1322
00:59:34,040 --> 00:59:36,088
我扮演卡丽熙 你扮演小手指
I was Khaleesi, you were Littlefinger...

1323
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:38,891
- 好了 别说了  - 拜托 拜托
- Okay, all right, stop. That's enough. - Please, please, please.

1324
00:59:39,240 --> 00:59:42,528
我们试一个简单的角色扮演练习吧
Why don't we try a simple role-playing exercise?

1325
00:59:42,720 --> 00:59:44,529
加尔文 你依然是加尔文
Calvin, you be Calvin

1326
00:59:44,720 --> 00:59:47,121
我来扮演麦吉
and I will become Maggie.

1327
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:48,805
Mmm.

1328
00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:50,851
我不明白
I'm confused.

1329
00:59:55,520 --> 00:59:57,204
这叫"灵魂凝视"
It's called "soul gazing."

1330
00:59:57,400 --> 01:00:01,007
凝视我的灵魂 我也凝视你的
Stare into my soul
and I'll stare into yours.

1331
01:00:01,720 --> 01:00:03,609
- 麦吉 这实在…  - 喂 嘘
- Maggie, this... - Hey. Shh.

1332
01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:05,842
不要说话 也不要扭头
There's no talking, and don't look away.

1333
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:07,365
凝视我的灵魂
Stare into my soul.

1334
01:00:07,880 --> 01:00:09,006
你不是我老婆
You are not my...

1335
01:00:09,160 --> 01:00:10,207
嘘 不要说话
Shh. There's no talking.

1336
01:00:10,680 --> 01:00:12,250
老婆 我可不凝视…
Babe, I'm not staring...

1337
01:00:12,680 --> 01:00:15,684
你和我 只看我 我是你老婆
Me and you. Stay with me. I'm your wife.

1338
01:00:15,880 --> 01:00:17,530
你不是我老婆
You are not my wife.

1339
01:00:20,040 --> 01:00:21,405
你怎么能打你老婆
How could you hit your wife?

1340
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:23,240
我什么
How can I... How can I what?

1341
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:25,004
- 你打了你老婆  - 不
- You hit your wife! - No...

1342
01:00:25,160 --> 01:00:26,161
- 他打了我  - 好吧
- He hit me! - Okay.

1343
01:00:26,320 --> 01:00:27,321
-  他打了你  - 好了
- He hit you! - Okay.

1344
01:00:27,480 --> 01:00:28,766
你打了我们
You hit us!

1345
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:35,084
- 我在抱着你  - 我知道你在干啥
- I'm swaddling you. - I know what you're doing.

1346
01:00:35,240 --> 01:00:36,651
- 我在抱着你  - 我知道…
- I'm swaddling you. - I know what you're...

1347
01:00:36,800 --> 01:00:37,801
过来
Come here.

1348
01:00:38,360 --> 01:00:39,521
天啊
Oh, my God!

1349
01:00:39,960 --> 01:00:40,961
你…
You...

1350
01:00:42,080 --> 01:00:44,526
算了 我们走 走
You know what? We're leaving! Let's go!

1351
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:46,650
这不是真实的
This is not real.

1352
01:00:46,800 --> 01:00:48,370
在我看来是真实的
It's real to me.

1353
01:00:48,520 --> 01:00:49,726
知道吗 加尔文
You know what, Calvin?

1354
01:00:49,880 --> 01:00:52,042
如果你不想改善我们的婚姻
If you can't commit to working on our marriage,

1355
01:00:52,200 --> 01:00:53,804
你要告诉我
then you need to let me know.

1356
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:55,331
麦吉 你…
Maggie, you...

1357
01:00:57,600 --> 01:00:59,250
- 哇  - 天啊
- What! - Oh, my God!

1358
01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:00,526
你精神不正常
You're... Something's not right.

1359
01:01:00,760 --> 01:01:03,730
拜托 听我说 拜托
Come on, Jet, listen. Come on, come on, Jet!

1360
01:01:03,880 --> 01:01:05,848
我知道最后有点不愉快
Now, I know things got a little rough there at the end.

1361
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,241
但说实话 因为你被很多人盯上了
But the truth is, with all the heat that you have coming down on you,

1362
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:10,323
麦吉不和你在一起更安全
Maggie is definitely safer without you.

1363
01:01:11,400 --> 01:01:13,687
相信我 等这件事结束后
And, trust me, when this whole thing is said and done

1364
01:01:13,840 --> 01:01:15,410
你基本上成了自由世界的拯救者
and you basically save the entire free world,

1365
01:01:15,560 --> 01:01:17,961
她就会原谅你 一切都自行解决了
she's going to forgive you. It'll all work itself out.

1366
01:01:18,120 --> 01:01:19,565
一切都自行解决了?
It'll all work itself out?

1367
01:01:20,360 --> 01:01:22,283
鲍勃 我厌倦了跟你玩游戏
Okay, Bob, you know, I'm sick of playing games with you.

1368
01:01:22,440 --> 01:01:23,851
真正的丹医生在哪儿
Where's the real Dr. Dan?

1369
01:01:24,600 --> 01:01:25,681
什么
What-what?

1370
01:01:25,840 --> 01:01:28,764
天啊 丹医生 这事跟我毫无关系
Oh, my... Dr. Dan, I had nothing to do with this.

1371
01:01:28,920 --> 01:01:30,251
他没事 等会我给你点水
He's fine. I'll get you some water in a little bit.

1372
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:32,641
谢谢你 医生
- Thanks, doc. - You know...

1373
01:01:32,880 --> 01:01:34,803
就这样 就这样
That's it. That is it.

1374
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:36,650
就这样
That is it.

1375
01:01:38,040 --> 01:01:39,087
杰
All right, Jet.

1376
01:01:39,240 --> 01:01:41,242
我看到哈里斯给了你一个按钮
I see that Harris has given you a button to push.

1377
01:01:42,200 --> 01:01:44,806
放松 如果我是你的话 也会答应她
Relax, I would've taken the same deal, too, if I was in your shoes.

1378
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:47,281
否则她不会放过你 对吗
Otherwise, she wouldn't let you out of her sight, right?

1379
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:48,885
这完全合情合理
It makes perfect sense.

1380
01:01:50,080 --> 01:01:51,764
但你不会按按钮的吧
But you're not going to press the button, right?

1381
01:01:53,120 --> 01:01:55,168
你有机密的卫星密码吗
You got the top-secret satellite codes?

1382
01:01:55,720 --> 01:01:56,960
有还是没有
Yes or no?

1383
01:01:57,120 --> 01:01:58,929
现在别忽悠我
This ain't the time to bullshit me.

1384
01:01:59,080 --> 01:02:00,809
我的屁股在出汗
Okay, my ass is sweating.

1385
01:02:00,960 --> 01:02:02,200
我很紧张 别忽悠我
I'm nervous. Don't bullshit me!

1386
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:04,482
当然没有 喂 拜托
Of course not, dude. Hey, hey, come on!

1387
01:02:04,640 --> 01:02:05,971
我当然没有密码
Of course I don't have the codes.

1388
01:02:06,120 --> 01:02:07,610
否则我何必找你
Why would I go through all this trouble, then?

1389
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:10,001
我需要你的专业技能 帮我查到
I need your skill set, Jet, to help me get

1390
01:02:10,200 --> 01:02:12,282
中标买家的银行交易号码
the bank transaction numbers to the winning bid.

1391
01:02:12,440 --> 01:02:14,124
从你电脑的倒计时上看
We already know it's going down tonight

1392
01:02:14,280 --> 01:02:15,645
我们已经知道是在今晚
from the countdown on your computer.

1393
01:02:15,800 --> 01:02:17,290
我们只需知道是在哪儿
Now, all we need is the "where."

1394
01:02:17,720 --> 01:02:19,927
而银行交易号码能告诉我们是哪儿
And the bank transaction numbers will give us the "where."

1395
01:02:20,080 --> 01:02:21,286
所以我需要你
That's why I need you.

1396
01:02:21,440 --> 01:02:22,805
你的工作使得你
Your job gives you access to

1397
01:02:22,960 --> 01:02:24,689
能获取这种信息
exactly that kind of information.

1398
01:02:24,880 --> 01:02:26,962
然后我们就能抓住大黑獾 抓住买家
Then we can get The Badger, we can get the buyer

1399
01:02:27,120 --> 01:02:28,201
一网打尽
in one fell swoop.

1400
01:02:28,360 --> 01:02:30,089
今晚就能大功告成
And it'll all be over tonight.

1401
01:02:30,280 --> 01:02:31,486
拜托 我发誓
Please, I swear.

1402
01:02:31,680 --> 01:02:33,125
你一定要相信我
You gotta believe me.

1403
01:02:36,092 --> 01:02:38,219
巴尔的摩金融区

1404
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,082
现在不能搞到交易号码吗
Can't you just get us the transaction number?

1405
01:02:45,480 --> 01:02:47,767
搞不到 因为这钱来自海外账户
Not when the money originates from an offshore account.

1406
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:51,287
这种情况下, 只有注册的国际银行官员才能查看.
When that happens, then only a certified international banking official can access it.

1407
01:02:49,063 --> 01:02:51,399


1408
01:02:51,440 --> 01:02:53,522
但应该不成问题 我们只要把
But, it shouldn't be a problem. We just give this guy

1409
01:02:53,680 --> 01:02:55,444
你给我的海外账号给他
the offshore account numbers that you gave me,

1410
01:02:55,600 --> 01:02:57,090
他就能告诉我们交易号码
then he can give us the transaction number

1411
01:02:57,240 --> 01:02:59,402
完全意识不到他已经犯了叛国罪
without knowing that he's committing treason when he does it.

1412
01:02:59,560 --> 01:03:00,766
是不是跟你相似?
Sound familiar?

1413
01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:03,008
很卑鄙啊 加尔文
Ouch! Low blow, CJ.

1414
01:03:03,160 --> 01:03:05,083
而且 除非我们搞错了 才是叛国罪
Hey, besides, it's only treason if we're wrong.

1415
01:03:05,240 --> 01:03:06,571
这个神秘人是谁啊
Who's this mystery man?

1416
01:03:07,960 --> 01:03:08,961
是特雷弗
It's Trevor.

1417
01:03:13,680 --> 01:03:14,806
特雷弗
Trevor.

1418
01:03:17,600 --> 01:03:19,170
这周越来越棒了
This week just keeps getting better.

1419
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:24,328
毕竟, 怪鸡鸡鲍勃和黄金杰加尔文·乔伊纳来到我的办公室.
You know, I mean, Robbie Wheirdicht and Calvin "The Golden Jet" Joyner in my office.

1420
01:03:20,928 --> 01:03:24,307


1421
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:26,448
谁能想到呢 反正我想不到
Who would've thunk it? Not me.

1422
01:03:26,600 --> 01:03:28,443
这真不错
This is great, huh?

1423
01:03:28,600 --> 01:03:30,602
你真是大变样啊
Talk about caterpillar to the butterfly...

1424
01:03:30,760 --> 01:03:32,683
是不是参加了P90X减肥计划?
What is this? P90X?

1425
01:03:32,840 --> 01:03:35,730
效果太明显了
More like "P1,000,000X," huh?

1426
01:03:35,880 --> 01:03:37,450
恭喜你
Congratulations.

1427
01:03:37,880 --> 01:03:39,370
喂 我…
Hey, I, um...

1428
01:03:39,520 --> 01:03:40,965
我很感谢你的帮助 特雷弗
I really appreciate the help, Trevor.

1429
01:03:41,120 --> 01:03:43,361
我的客户一直催着我赶紧把这事办了
My client's all on me to get this stuff handled right away.

1430
01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:44,681
只要你能…
So, you know, if we could...

1431
01:03:44,880 --> 01:03:46,803
不用多说 不客气 我也经历过
Say no more. It's my pleasure. I've been there.

1432
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:48,450
如果没有权限的话
These international accounts can be very, very tricky

1433
01:03:48,600 --> 01:03:49,647
这种国际账户很难查
if you don't have the right clearances.

1434
01:03:49,840 --> 01:03:51,604
会被各种拒绝
You can get a bunch of digital red tape.

1435
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:53,968
我很高兴能帮忙
I'm happy to help, you know?

1436
01:03:54,120 --> 01:03:55,167
鲍勃
Robbie.

1437
01:03:55,320 --> 01:03:57,129
看到你 想起很多往事啊
You're such a blast from the past, buddy.

1438
01:03:57,280 --> 01:03:58,281
你后来怎么样了
How long has it been since I saw you?

1439
01:03:58,440 --> 01:03:59,487
上次见面是在高中吧
Was it high school?

1440
01:04:02,480 --> 01:04:03,481
怎么了
What's that?

1441
01:04:03,640 --> 01:04:06,086
这个会计号码出来了吗
Um... How we doing with those account access codes?

1442
01:04:06,240 --> 01:04:07,287
快出来了吗
- Are they coming? - It's coming.

1443
01:04:07,440 --> 01:04:08,680
快出来了
- Everything's good? - It's coming.

1444
01:04:08,840 --> 01:04:11,286
我在尽快 我知道你们赶时间 真对不起
I'm going as fast as I can. I know you guys are in a rush. I'm so sorry.

1445
01:04:11,440 --> 01:04:13,488
对中央高中的同学是一定要帮忙的
Anything for a couple of fellow Centaurs.

1446
01:04:13,640 --> 01:04:16,405
说到高中同学 你们今晚要参加同学聚会吧?
Speaking of which, you guys are going to the reunion tonight, right?

1447
01:04:18,440 --> 01:04:20,169
不 我们不去
No, I don't think so.

1448
01:04:20,320 --> 01:04:21,481
你俩都要去
You're both going.

1449
01:04:21,640 --> 01:04:23,369
有了 这是你们的交易号码
Here it is. Here's your transaction number.

1450
01:04:23,520 --> 01:04:25,124
你俩都要去 知道为什么吗
You're both going because you want to know what?

1451
01:04:25,280 --> 01:04:26,520
臭臭彼得也要去
Stinky Pete's going to be there.

1452
01:04:26,680 --> 01:04:29,604
长蛋蛋吉米给我打了电话 他也要去
And Jimmy Longballs called me. He's going to be hanging.

1453
01:04:30,360 --> 01:04:33,284
长崎卡洛斯 那个墨西哥蛋卷 他也要去
Carlos Nagasaki, the Mexican eggroll. He's going to be there.

1454
01:04:33,800 --> 01:04:35,802
你们不去就太可惜了
You guys will be missing out on a big one.

1455
01:04:35,960 --> 01:04:37,121
而且他们还要
Plus you know what they're going to do?

1456
01:04:37,280 --> 01:04:39,282
再次评选返校节国王和女王
They're going to vote on homecoming king and queen again.

1457
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:41,044
也许你和麦吉能再次当选
Maybe you and Maggie can make it two for two.

1458
01:04:41,360 --> 01:04:43,522
在你们走之前 先再坐一会
Now, before you go, stay seated one second.

1459
01:04:43,680 --> 01:04:45,364
给我两分钟时间 坐下
Give me two minutes, sit down.

1460
01:04:46,040 --> 01:04:47,644
两位
Men,

1461
01:04:48,160 --> 01:04:49,491
几年前
a few years ago...

1462
01:04:50,680 --> 01:04:52,648
我皈依了上帝
I found the Lord Almighty.

1463
01:04:52,800 --> 01:04:53,801
在那之后
And, ever since then,

1464
01:04:53,960 --> 01:04:56,804
我的人生完全变了
my life has been completely different. Okay?

1465
01:04:56,960 --> 01:04:59,327
他对我们每个人都是有安排的
He's got a plan for each and every one of us

1466
01:04:59,480 --> 01:05:01,369
以他无穷的智慧
and, in his infinite wisdom,

1467
01:05:01,520 --> 01:05:03,761
他是不会犯错的
he makes no mistakes. Hmm?

1468
01:05:04,320 --> 01:05:05,651
这话说得对
You're right about that.

1469
01:05:05,800 --> 01:05:08,525
我觉得上帝让你们来是为了能让我倾诉.
I think the Lord put you here because he wants me to get something off my chest.

1470
01:05:07,159 --> 01:05:08,619


1471
01:05:08,680 --> 01:05:11,685
他希望我能求得良心安稳 让我要求你的原谅
He wants me to clear my conscience and he wants me to ask for forgiveness.

1472
01:05:10,121 --> 01:05:11,706


1473
01:05:11,880 --> 01:05:12,881
鲍勃
Robert.

1474
01:05:13,080 --> 01:05:17,165
高四开会时我对你的伤害是懦弱的行为
What I did to you at that rally in senior year was a cowardly act.

1475
01:05:15,710 --> 01:05:17,128


1476
01:05:17,320 --> 01:05:19,687
这件事让我每天都后悔
It's something that I've regretted every single day.

1477
01:05:19,840 --> 01:05:22,844
欺负人是全国性的恶行
Yeah. I mean, bullying is a national crisis.

1478
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:27,369
会给人造成一生的痛苦
It can leave people with a lifetime of pain.

1479
01:05:27,520 --> 01:05:30,967
我对你的伤害我没任何借口
And I just have no excuse for what I did to you.

1480
01:05:31,120 --> 01:05:33,407
虽然我父亲是个暴力的人
I mean, I did grow up in a house with a father who was physical,

1481
01:05:33,560 --> 01:05:35,881
但不等于我有权利发泄到别人身上
but that doesn't give me the right to take it out on somebody

1482
01:05:36,040 --> 01:05:38,520
欺负当时弱小的你 因此
who at the time was weaker, you know? So...

1483
01:05:38,880 --> 01:05:42,009
加尔文 我这一恶行
Calvin, with this particular transgression,

1484
01:05:42,160 --> 01:05:45,687
不仅羞辱了他 也毁了你的最后演讲
I not only embarrassed him but I also ruined your final speech.

1485
01:05:45,840 --> 01:05:47,490
- 没有  - 是真的
- No, no. - Yes, I did.

1486
01:05:47,640 --> 01:05:49,961
- 没关系  - 不 我抢了你的风头
- It's okay. No, it's okay. - No, really, I stole your thunder.

1487
01:05:50,120 --> 01:05:52,521
这件事也让我每天都深受折磨
And it's another thing that I've had to live with every single day.

1488
01:05:52,680 --> 01:05:57,404
我求助于心理医生和谈话小组为此祈祷
And I work through it in individual therapy as well as group, and I pray about it.

1489
01:05:55,708 --> 01:05:57,376


1490
01:05:59,200 --> 01:06:00,326
所以
So...

1491
01:06:03,720 --> 01:06:07,930
我想说 对以前的事
I just want to say how truly sorry I am

1492
01:06:08,080 --> 01:06:10,606
我非常抱歉
for what happened, you know.

1493
01:06:10,760 --> 01:06:12,205
对我做过的事
Or for what I did.

1494
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:13,686
不能说发生的事 是我做的事
It didn't just happen. I did it.

1495
01:06:13,840 --> 01:06:16,571
我做过了 我祈祷上帝我并没有做过
I did it, and I wish to God that I had not done it.

1496
01:06:17,080 --> 01:06:20,209
所以 我希望你能有这个胸怀
So, I'm hoping that you can find it in your heart

1497
01:06:21,400 --> 01:06:23,289
能原谅我
to forgive me.

1498
01:06:25,080 --> 01:06:27,208
这倒让我完全没想到
I wasn't expecting this at all.

1499
01:06:27,360 --> 01:06:29,044
是啊 是啊
Don't I know it. I know it.

1500
01:06:30,240 --> 01:06:31,730
我很高兴
I'm just so happy.

1501
01:06:32,840 --> 01:06:34,410
不知道该说什么好
I don't know what to say.

1502
01:06:35,160 --> 01:06:36,764
你可以说：
How about you say...

1503
01:06:38,240 --> 01:06:42,211
奥斯卡奖非特雷弗·奥尔森莫属
"The Oscar goes to Trevor Olson."

1504
01:06:45,640 --> 01:06:47,244
你什么意思
What do you mean?

1505
01:06:55,400 --> 01:06:56,686
怪鸡鸡
Weird Dick!

1506
01:06:56,840 --> 01:06:58,444
你这蠢货
You stupid ass!

1507
01:06:58,600 --> 01:07:00,284
天啊 你可真傻
Good God, you're dumb!

1508
01:07:00,440 --> 01:07:02,363
比以前还傻
Dumber than ever, I guess!

1509
01:07:02,520 --> 01:07:04,284
你也是 加尔文
And you, too, Calvin!

1510
01:07:04,440 --> 01:07:07,091
看你俩这傻乎乎的表情
Look at that stupid look on those two faces.

1511
01:07:07,240 --> 01:07:10,084
"上帝让我关心"难以置信
"The Lord taught me to care." Unbelievable.

1512
01:07:10,240 --> 01:07:13,528
首先 我是个山达基教徒
I'm a Scientologist. Okay, that's "A."

1513
01:07:13,680 --> 01:07:15,967
自从2003年就不相信有灵魂了
And thetan-free since 2003.

1514
01:07:16,120 --> 01:07:17,121
就这么简单
Clear as shit.

1515
01:07:17,280 --> 01:07:18,520
至于我后悔做过的事
And "I'm sorry for what I did"?

1516
01:07:18,720 --> 01:07:19,926
告诉你我后悔什么
Let me tell you what I'm sorry about.

1517
01:07:20,080 --> 01:07:22,447
我后悔没把你多扔进去几次
I'm sorry I didn't toss your naked ass out there three more times.

1518
01:07:22,640 --> 01:07:23,971
那是最棒的高四恶作剧
It was the best senior prank ever.

1519
01:07:24,120 --> 01:07:25,610
我现在还能收到这件事的邮件呢
I still get emails about it.

1520
01:07:25,840 --> 01:07:27,683
如果当年有这东西
And if I'd had one of these bad boys back then,

1521
01:07:27,840 --> 01:07:29,171
我会拍下来 上传
I would have shot it, uploaded it,

1522
01:07:29,320 --> 01:07:31,766
会在网上疯传 上亿的点击量
and it would have gone crazy viral, a zillion hits.

1523
01:07:31,920 --> 01:07:32,967
知道吗
Know what?

1524
01:07:33,120 --> 01:07:34,724
你会后悔你开口说话了
You're going to regret you ever opened your mouth.

1525
01:07:34,880 --> 01:07:37,281
- 听见了吗  - 是吗 为什么呢 加尔文
- You hear me, Trevor? - Yeah? How come, Calvin?

1526
01:07:37,440 --> 01:07:38,930
因为他要揍你一顿
Because he's about to whoop your ass, that's why.

1527
01:07:39,080 --> 01:07:40,081
谁要揍我
Who is?

1528
01:07:40,280 --> 01:07:41,327
鲍勃 去揍他啊
Bob, get up and whoop his ass.

1529
01:07:41,480 --> 01:07:43,562
她来了 我告诉你们
Here she comes! Let me tell you something...

1530
01:07:43,720 --> 01:07:46,610
怪鸡鸡不可能吃了点激素
Weird Dick can't chug a bunch of fucking steroids and elk urine

1531
01:07:46,760 --> 01:07:48,649
就突然能打过我了
and suddenly be able to kick my ass.

1532
01:07:48,800 --> 01:07:50,802
得了吧 这不可能
Fuck that! It ain't gonna happen.

1533
01:07:51,160 --> 01:07:52,446
因为
'Cause here's why.

1534
01:07:53,840 --> 01:07:57,367
小时候是胖子 就永远是胖子
Once a fat kid, always a fat kid.

1535
01:07:57,880 --> 01:07:59,006
证明我错了
Huh? Prove me wrong.

1536
01:07:59,160 --> 01:08:00,730
鲍勃 来啊 像你在酒吧那样
Bob, come on. Do what you did in the bar.

1537
01:08:11,640 --> 01:08:13,722
来啊 打我啊
Come on, hit me!

1538
01:08:13,880 --> 01:08:16,167
我会起诉你 没收你的腰包
And I'll sue your ass, and take your fanny pack away.

1539
01:08:18,280 --> 01:08:19,725
你想去大便吗
You got to make poopies?

1540
01:08:20,080 --> 01:08:21,081
你怎么了 鲍勃
What's wrong, Bob?

1541
01:08:21,280 --> 01:08:22,327
我们这里有厕所
We got a john here.

1542
01:08:22,840 --> 01:08:24,683
还是你要换卫生巾?
Or you got to change your rag?

1543
01:08:25,400 --> 01:08:26,401
也许就是这原因
Maybe that's it.

1544
01:08:26,760 --> 01:08:28,524
珍妮 你有多余的卫生巾吗
Jenny, you got an extra rag?

1545
01:08:29,720 --> 01:08:31,722
- 你是怎么了  - 我只想走
- What's the matter with you? - I just want to go.

1546
01:08:31,880 --> 01:08:33,166

She wants to go.

1547
01:08:33,880 --> 01:08:35,882
走吧 好的
Go ahead. There you go.

1548
01:08:36,480 --> 01:08:37,561
不 要推
No, it's a push.

1549
01:08:37,720 --> 01:08:39,927
50％的机会 你错过了
Boy, 50-50 shot. You missed that.

1550
01:08:40,080 --> 01:08:41,411
至少你找到了门把手
At least you found the handle.

1551
01:08:41,560 --> 01:08:44,040
天 他依然是个胆怯的小姑娘

1553
01:08:45,720 --> 01:08:47,768
你也依然比我的猫要矮

很高兴看到你一点没变
Glad to see you haven't changed a bit.

1558
01:08:58,000 --> 01:08:59,001
再见
Bye-bye now.

1559
01:08:59,160 --> 01:09:00,446
- 是推还是拉  - 直接推
- Was it push or pull? - Clean push.

1560
01:09:00,600 --> 01:09:02,125
- 是哪扇门?  - 要我帮你开门吗

是哪一扇门
Which one is it?

1562
01:09:04,560 --> 01:09:07,131

珍妮
Jenny!

1564
01:09:08,600 --> 01:09:11,490
珍妮 拿清洁剂来 让保安把他赶走
Jenny, get the Windex! And security for this one.

1565
01:09:11,640 --> 01:09:13,927
别摸我的门了 够了
Get your asshole off my door! That's it!

1566
01:09:15,480 --> 01:09:17,369
鲍勃 鲍勃
Bob! Bob!

1567

你要这么做
So, here's what you're going to do.

你要告诉我们你和鲍勃在哪儿
You're going to tell us exactly where you and Bob are.

Then you're going to go outside and you're going to keep Bob on-site until we arrive.

1575
01:09:44,800 --> 01:09:47,007
如果他走了 你就输了
And if he leaves, you lose.

1576
01:09:47,760 --> 01:09:49,330
听见了吗
Is that clear?

1577
01:09:54,840 --> 01:09:55,841
喂
Oh, hey.

1578
01:09:56,040 --> 01:09:58,601
我不知道自己是怎么了, 我突然凝固了.
I don't know what happened in there, and I just froze up.

1579
01:09:57,408 --> 01:09:58,576


1580
01:09:58,760 --> 01:10:00,444
被冻住了 对不起

鲍勃 我…

不 我得对你说 加尔文

01:10:19,440 --> 01:10:20,805
你是我唯一的朋友 加尔文

我再也不会让你失望 我保证

1590
01:10:25,840 --> 01:10:27,410
对不起
I'm sorry, man.

1591
01:10:31,080 --> 01:10:32,206
什么对不起
Sorry for what?

1592
01:10:32,360 --> 01:10:34,044
我告诉了哈里斯我们在哪儿
I told Harris where we are.

1593
01:10:35,080 --> 01:10:36,650
他们威胁要伤害麦吉

1594

我没别的办法
I had to. I didn't have a choice.

1595
01:10:39,280 --> 01:10:40,406
对不起

1598
01:11:07,437 --> 01:11:10,148
中情局安全屋 地点未知

1599
01:11:19,120 --> 01:11:22,325
你知道这套程序,我就不装腔作势了.
I know you know how this goes, so I'll spare you the dramatics.

1600
01:11:20,783 --> 01:11:22,285


1601
01:11:22,480 --> 01:11:24,562
我只问你一次
I'll ask you just once.

1602

卫星密码在哪儿
Where are the satellite encryption codes?

1603
01:11:29,080 --> 01:11:31,128
怎么了 鲍勃
Aw. What's the matter, Bob?

1604
01:11:31,840 --> 01:11:35,003
因为被你的朋友出卖了而难过?

我没任何朋友

1606

我不想看这个 两位

1607
01:11:39,200 --> 01:11:40,611
放心 很快就结束
Don't worry, it'll be over quick.

她总能让嫌疑人崩溃

1609

好吧 那就按你的意思办

1610

我们用传统的审讯方式

把抽取工具拿来

1612

01:12:00,680 --> 01:12:02,648
如果你不忍心看 你可以走
If you don't have the stomach for it, you can go.

为什么让我来这里 不是说我可以走了吗
Why am I coming here? I was told I'd be able to leave.

1617
01:12:20,960 --> 01:12:22,041
你可以走
You can leave,

1618
01:12:22,200 --> 01:12:24,881
只要哈里斯特工允许你走, 而这是不可能的.
when Agent Harris says you can leave, which might be never.

1619
01:12:23,763 --> 01:12:24,847


1620
01:12:25,080 --> 01:12:26,445
我得去看看
I gotta watch this.

1621

对不起 鲍勃
I'm sorry, Bob.

1622

I'm sorry, man.

1623
01:12:51,280 --> 01:12:52,406
天啊
Oh, Jesus!

1624
01:13:00,240 --> 01:13:01,241
怎么回事
What the hell?

1625
01:13:02,800 --> 01:13:04,484
喂 喂
Hey! Hey!

1626

把手举起来 离开操作台
You get your hands off! Get them off the keyboard!

1633
01:13:18,600 --> 01:13:19,931
对不起 对不起
Sorry. I'm sorry.

1634
01:13:20,120 --> 01:13:22,122
- 坐下  - 坐下  - 好 好
- Sit down! Sit down! - Okay, okay, okay.

1635
01:13:24,360 --> 01:13:25,361
知道吗 鲍勃
You know, Bob?

1636
01:13:25,520 --> 01:13:28,171
这是我在这一行最爱做的事
This is actually my favorite part of the job.

1637
01:13:28,320 --> 01:13:30,561
谢谢你这么合作
Thank you for being so uncooperative.

1638
01:13:30,720 --> 01:13:33,771
如果你的朋友乔伊纳看到这一幕, 他会说什么?
What do you think your little buddy, Joyner, would say if he could see you like this?

1639
01:13:32,332 --> 01:13:33,958


1640
01:13:34,120 --> 01:13:35,121
两个词
Two words.

1641
01:13:35,280 --> 01:13:36,327
我参与
I'm in.

1642
01:13:37,320 --> 01:13:39,163
哇
What-what?

1643
01:13:39,480 --> 01:13:41,847
你这是犯了大错误 乔伊纳先生
You're making a big mistake, Mr. Joyner.

1644
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:43,968
除非我搞错了
That's only if I'm wrong.

1645
01:13:45,800 --> 01:13:47,325
快 鲍勃 我们走
Come on, Bob. Let's go!

1646
01:13:47,520 --> 01:13:49,363
你还愣着干什么 快走啊
What're you doing? Come on, man!

1647
01:13:50,800 --> 01:13:53,007
好吧 听我说 鲍勃 对不起
Okay, listen to me. Bob, I'm sorry.

1648
01:13:53,160 --> 01:13:55,128
对不起我出卖了你
I'm sorry I double-crossed you. You hear me?

1649
01:13:55,320 --> 01:13:57,368
我本该信任你 可我没有
I should've believed you, I should've trusted you, and I didn't.

1650
01:13:57,520 --> 01:13:58,521
我对此很抱歉
I'm sorry for that.

1651
01:13:58,680 --> 01:14:01,251
听我说 鲍勃 我们没时间耽搁
Listen to me. Bob, we don't have time for this, man!

1652
01:14:01,400 --> 01:14:03,528
我需要你用你的超级间谍手段
I need you to tap into that super-spy stuff

1653
01:14:03,680 --> 01:14:06,604
带我们出去 听见了吗
and I need you to get us the hell out of here right now. Do you hear me?

1654
01:14:06,840 --> 01:14:08,604
我不是个超级间谍 加尔文
I'm not a super spy, Calvin.

1655
01:14:09,680 --> 01:14:11,808
我是超级傻瓜怪鸡鸡鲍勃
I'm Robbie Wheirdicht, super tool.

1656
01:14:11,960 --> 01:14:14,042
别说了 你不是超级傻瓜
No, stop. You're not a super tool.

1657
01:14:14,200 --> 01:14:16,601
你甚至不是怪鸡鸡鲍勃 你是鲍勃·斯通
You're not even Robbie Wheirdicht. You're Bob Stone!

1658
01:14:17,200 --> 01:14:18,884
- 这是假名  - 那又如何
- I made that name up. - So what?

1659
01:14:19,040 --> 01:14:21,281
- 这不是真名  - 那又怎么样 那又怎么样
- It's not real. - What does that mean? What does that mean?

1660
01:14:21,440 --> 01:14:25,206
你以为T先生和斯汀生下来就是这名字吗
You think Mr. T and Sting were born with those names?

1661
01:14:26,920 --> 01:14:28,763
你知道我在高中时的"黄金喷气机"的绰号是怎么来的吗
How do you think I got the name "Golden Jet" at high school?

1662
01:14:28,920 --> 01:14:31,844
- 因为你很牛逼  - 不 不是那个原因
- 'Cause you're awesome. - No, that's not how.

1663
01:14:32,720 --> 01:14:35,371
在初二时 我参加径赛 那是我第一次赛跑
In the eighth grade, I ran track. It was my first race.

1664
01:14:35,520 --> 01:14:38,410
最后我和另一个学生并驾齐驱
Okay, the race came down to me and this other kid.

1665
01:14:38,560 --> 01:14:40,050
我太想拿第一了
I wanted to win the race so damn bad

1666
01:14:40,240 --> 01:14:42,402
过了终点后都尿了裤子
that I ended up peeing in my pants at the finish line.

1667
01:14:42,640 --> 01:14:44,404
所以人称"黄金喷气机"
That's how I got the name "Golden Jet."

1668
01:14:45,120 --> 01:14:48,044
所以相信我这么一个为了跑个第一 就不惜在很多人面前
So, take it from a guy who's literally pissed his pants in front of everybody

1669
01:14:48,200 --> 01:14:49,565
尿裤子的人的话：
just to win a race.

1670
01:14:49,800 --> 01:14:51,723
你决定你是什么样的人
You are who you decide to be.

1671
01:14:52,240 --> 01:14:55,005
你选择成为国际中情局间谍
And you chose to be an international CIA spy.

1672
01:14:55,360 --> 01:14:57,283
你以杀人为生
Come on, man. You get to kill people for a living.

1673
01:14:57,760 --> 01:14:58,761
多牛逼啊
How cool is that?

1674
01:15:00,920 --> 01:15:03,127
谈不上
I don't know.

1675
01:15:03,400 --> 01:15:04,401
有几分牛逼吧
Kinda cool I guess.

1676
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,128
怎么还有几分 这可不是有几分
What do you mean "kinda cool"? Ain't no kinda cool.

1677
01:15:07,480 --> 01:15:09,448
别胡说 这是太牛逼了
Stop it! It's awesome.

1678
01:15:09,760 --> 01:15:11,091
拜托 我们是兄弟?
Now, come on, man. We boys?

1679
01:15:12,760 --> 01:15:13,761
- 我们是兄弟  - 啊
- We're boys. - Oh!

1680
01:15:15,440 --> 01:15:16,441
对不起 杰
Sorry, Jet.

1681
01:15:16,920 --> 01:15:18,604
天啊
Oh, God!

1682
01:15:19,520 --> 01:15:20,521
天啊
Oh, God!

1683
01:15:20,920 --> 01:15:22,524
看 完好如初
See? Good as new.

1684
01:15:23,800 --> 01:15:25,643
对不起
Wow. Sorry, man.

1685
01:15:29,560 --> 01:15:30,607
快走 快走
Go, go!

1686
01:15:31,120 --> 01:15:32,167
解开我
Get me out!

1687
01:15:32,320 --> 01:15:34,209
他出其不意袭击了我们 给我钥匙
He got the jump on us. Give me the key.

1688
01:15:37,600 --> 01:15:38,647
当心 鲍勃
Look out, Bob!

1689
01:15:39,760 --> 01:15:41,888
过来 杰 揍他
Here, Jet! Get him!

1690
01:15:42,040 --> 01:15:43,451
当心
Watch out!

1691
01:15:52,120 --> 01:15:53,485
你看到了吗 鲍勃
Did you see that, Bob?

1692
01:15:53,640 --> 01:15:55,722
我用了那招 我用了你那招
I did the thing! I did the thing, Bob!

1693
01:15:55,880 --> 01:15:56,881
是啊
Yeah!

1694
01:15:57,040 --> 01:15:58,963
耶 耶
Yeah! Yeah!

1695
01:15:59,240 --> 01:16:00,605
- 来 跟我走  - 我们走吧
- Come on! Follow me! - Let's do it!

1696
01:16:00,760 --> 01:16:03,331
我这是干什么 你拿着枪
No! What the fuck am I doing? Here! You get the gun.

1697
01:16:03,480 --> 01:16:05,130
- 我跟你走  - 好
- I'm behind you. Go. - All right.

1698
01:16:09,680 --> 01:16:11,523
天啊 他们有两个人
Oh, my God. There's two of them.

1699
01:16:11,680 --> 01:16:14,126
是的 我引开他们 你去开门
Yeah, I'll distract them and you open the door, okay?

1700
01:16:14,280 --> 01:16:15,691
- 什么 不  - 我们走
- What? No! - Let's roll.

1701
01:16:15,880 --> 01:16:16,927
不 不
No, no.

1702
01:16:18,880 --> 01:16:20,166
走 走
Go, go!

1703
01:16:20,880 --> 01:16:23,042
- 在追赶  - 出来了
- Close in! - Moving out!

1704
01:16:23,200 --> 01:16:25,123
- 不许动 鲍勃  - 对不起了 两位
- Freeze, Bob! - Sorry about this, guys.

1705
01:16:28,280 --> 01:16:29,850
不 过来
Nope, come here.

1706
01:16:39,920 --> 01:16:41,206
快点
Come on.

1707
01:16:41,360 --> 01:16:43,601
不是这个钥匙卡 转过身来
Wrong keycard, pal. Turn around.

1708
01:16:45,680 --> 01:16:46,841
需要这个钥匙卡
You needed this one.

1709
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:48,240
现在趴在地上
On the ground, now.

1710
01:16:48,400 --> 01:16:49,686
我能先说句话吗
Can I say something first?

1711
01:16:49,840 --> 01:16:51,410
- 说什么  - 这下够你受的
- What? - This is going to hurt.

1712
01:16:54,280 --> 01:16:56,442
- 喂 解下钥匙卡 我们走  - 好 好
- Hey, get the keycard! Let's roll. - All right, all right.

1713
01:16:59,200 --> 01:17:00,486
我们坐哪辆车
Which car are we taking?

1714
01:17:02,520 --> 01:17:03,567
不是那辆
Not that one.

1715
01:17:03,760 --> 01:17:05,364
天啊
Oh, my God.

1716
01:17:05,920 --> 01:17:07,729
天啊 啊
Oh, God. Oh, sh...

1717
01:17:08,640 --> 01:17:09,641
噢
Oh.

1718
01:17:09,960 --> 01:17:11,166
来 杰
Here we go, Jet.

1719
01:17:13,280 --> 01:17:15,726
- 鲍勃 他们在射我们  - 没事 这是防弹玻璃
- Bob, they are shooting at us! - It's okay, it's bulletproof.

1720
01:17:15,880 --> 01:17:16,881
开车 开车
Drive, drive!

1721
01:17:28,760 --> 01:17:29,966
给 杰
Here you go, Jet.

1722
01:17:30,680 --> 01:17:31,681
这是什么
What's this?

1723
01:17:31,840 --> 01:17:33,888
逃生包 中情局送的礼物
Bug-out bag, courtesy of the CIA.

1724
01:17:34,080 --> 01:17:35,411
拿出里面的加密手机
Go ahead and grab that encrypted phone in there.

1725
01:17:35,560 --> 01:17:36,561
做什么用
For what?

1726
01:17:36,720 --> 01:17:38,370
银行交易码还在吗
You still have the bank transaction code?

1727
01:17:38,520 --> 01:17:41,444
交易号码怎么能帮我们找到坏人在哪儿
How are transaction numbers gonna help us find out where the bad guys are?

1728
01:17:41,600 --> 01:17:44,126
这不是银行交易号码或密码 其实是…
Well, it's not bank transaction numbers or codes, it's actually...

1729
01:17:44,280 --> 01:17:45,805
经度和纬度
Longitude and latitude.

1730
01:17:47,200 --> 01:17:50,921
看看杰的间谍头脑 哇
Look at the spy brain on the Jet! What-what!

1731
01:17:51,240 --> 01:17:53,481
你简直就是个黑人谷歌
You're like a chocolate Google.

1732
01:17:53,640 --> 01:17:55,688
鲍勃 别这么做 住手
Bob, don't do that. Stop it. Stop it.

1733
01:17:55,840 --> 01:17:56,921
你越来越擅长此道了
You're getting good at this, man.

1734
01:17:57,080 --> 01:17:58,923
你说的非常对 是经度和纬度
Yeah, you're absolutely right. It's longitude and latitude.

1735
01:17:59,080 --> 01:18:02,527
只要把这些数字输入GPS 就成了
All you gotta do is plug those digits into the GPS, and boom!

1736
01:18:02,720 --> 01:18:05,291
我们就能找到买家和大黑獾了
We're gonna catch the buyer and The Badger, just like that.

1737
01:18:07,440 --> 01:18:09,124
波士顿
Boston.

1738
01:18:12,640 --> 01:18:14,324
我们需要一架飞机
We're gonna need a plane.

1739
01:18:22,872 --> 01:18:26,459
私人机场 派克斯维尔

1740
01:18:27,720 --> 01:18:29,006
你偷过飞机吗?
You ever steal a plane before?

1741
01:18:29,160 --> 01:18:31,447
我偷过一袋糖果
- I stole some Starbursts one time. - Mmm-hmm.

1742
01:18:31,880 --> 01:18:33,962
不知道有没有可比性
So I don't know if that compares or anything,

1743
01:18:34,120 --> 01:18:35,565
反正那次并不成功
but I wasn't successful with that.

1744
01:18:35,720 --> 01:18:36,846
出门的时候掉了出来
On the way out, I dropped 'em.

1745
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:38,206
整包都掉了出来 被店主抓住了
Dropped the whole bag. The guy caught me.

1746
01:18:38,400 --> 01:18:40,004
这是什么 我说是糖果
"What's that?" I just said, "A Starburst."

1747
01:18:40,160 --> 01:18:42,162
直接告诉了他 很惨
Told him myself. It was a mess.

1748
01:18:44,960 --> 01:18:47,406
你看 真是天赐
Check it out. The universe provides.

1749
01:18:49,920 --> 01:18:50,921
噢
Oh.

1750
01:18:52,880 --> 01:18:53,881
黄金喷气机
Golden Jet.

1751
01:18:54,120 --> 01:18:55,531
- 黄金喷气机  - 黄金喷气机
- Golden Jet. - Golden Jet.

1752
01:18:59,440 --> 01:19:01,329
- 只有一个门卫  - 好
- It's just one guard in there. - All right.

1753
01:19:01,480 --> 01:19:03,130
90%间谍工作主要就是分散对方注意力
90% of spy work is distraction.

1754
01:19:03,280 --> 01:19:05,561
你去引开那门卫, 我就能搞到飞机了.
You get in there and distract that guard, I'm gonna get us a plane.

1755
01:19:04,456 --> 01:19:05,540


1756
01:19:06,280 --> 01:19:07,327
什么
What?

1757
01:19:09,160 --> 01:19:10,650
你以为我能…
I don't know what the hell you expect...

1758
01:19:13,080 --> 01:19:14,081
鲍勃
Bob!

1759
01:19:14,880 --> 01:19:15,881
鲍勃
Bob!

1760
01:19:16,520 --> 01:19:17,567
该死的
Fuck!

1761
01:19:18,160 --> 01:19:19,241
你去死 鲍勃
Fuck you, Bob!

1762
01:19:20,640 --> 01:19:21,641
该死的
Damn it!

1763
01:19:29,720 --> 01:19:32,041
嗨 我需要一架飞机
Hey, I need a plane.

1764
01:19:32,240 --> 01:19:35,164
对不起 你不能进来 这是私人机场
Sir, you cannot be in here. This is a private airfield.

1765
01:19:35,320 --> 01:19:37,846
我知道 但我这个冷藏箱里有个器官
I understand that but I have an organ in this cooler right now

1766
01:19:38,040 --> 01:19:40,042
需要尽快送去
that needs to get transported ASAP.

1767
01:19:40,720 --> 01:19:41,721
是吗
Really?

1768
01:19:41,920 --> 01:19:44,924
我小姨子去年做了心脏移植手术
Because my sister-in-law had a heart transplant last year

1769
01:19:45,080 --> 01:19:47,924
但却不是放在午餐冷藏箱里
and they did not bring it in a Playmate lunch cooler.

1770
01:19:48,080 --> 01:19:49,889
本不想对你说的
I hate to break it to you,

1771
01:19:50,040 --> 01:19:51,769
这里面装的
but this is not a...

1772
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:54,081
- 不是心脏  - 不是心脏?
- This is not a heart. - It's not a heart?

1773
01:19:55,360 --> 01:19:56,407
不是的
No, it's not.

1774
01:19:56,600 --> 01:19:57,806
那么是什么
Hmm. What is it then?

1775
01:19:58,880 --> 01:20:01,042
- 是一根鸡鸡  - 哦
- It's a dick. - Okay.

1776
01:20:02,600 --> 01:20:04,489
我现在有太多的问题
I am made of questions right now.

1777
01:20:04,640 --> 01:20:05,926
你不用问
Well, you don't have to ask.

1778
01:20:06,080 --> 01:20:07,889
昨晚 一个女人跟一个男人发生争执
Last night, lady got into it with a man.

1779
01:20:08,040 --> 01:20:09,724
最后切掉了他的鸡鸡
She ended up cutting his pecker off.

1780
01:20:09,880 --> 01:20:11,769
她拿着鸡鸡 开车走了
She left with it, got in a car, drove,

1781
01:20:11,920 --> 01:20:13,888
上了95号路 把鸡鸡扔出了车窗
got on 95, threw it out the window.

1782
01:20:14,240 --> 01:20:17,084
这是全国历史上第二大规模的搜寻鸡鸡
The second largest penis hunt in the state history.

1783
01:20:17,240 --> 01:20:20,006
这男人是个韩国人, 所以很久才找到.
The man was Korean, so you better believe it took a long time to find.

1784
01:20:18,697 --> 01:20:19,990


1785
01:20:20,600 --> 01:20:22,489
你这是歧视韩国人鸡鸡
You're stereotyping Korean dicks.

1786
01:20:22,640 --> 01:20:23,721
这是种族主义
That's racist.

1787
01:20:23,920 --> 01:20:25,649
我见过比你还大的韩国人鸡鸡
I've seen Korean dicks bigger than you.

1788
01:20:25,840 --> 01:20:28,366
找到之后 那人把鸡鸡交给我
Okay, after finding it, the guy brought it to me,

1789
01:20:28,520 --> 01:20:31,364
他说：请务必把这根鸡鸡送到该去的地方
and he said, "Do your due diligence in getting this dick where it's got to go."

1790
01:20:31,520 --> 01:20:32,806
我就是干这行的
That's what I do.

1791
01:20:32,960 --> 01:20:35,281
我是个运送鸡鸡专家
I'm a dick deliverer specialist.

1792
01:20:35,720 --> 01:20:36,721
哦 简称DDS
Oh, DDS?

1793
01:20:36,960 --> 01:20:38,564
就像牙医 只不过是鸡鸡
Like a dentist but for dicks.

1794
01:20:39,320 --> 01:20:40,321
呃
Uh...

1795
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:43,810
别人会找你说：这是根鸡鸡 找架飞机吧
So, people are like, "Here's a dick. Find a plane."

1796
01:20:44,640 --> 01:20:46,722
你就是干这行的?专门运送鸡鸡的?
That's how you do it? You're like an Uber for dicks?

1797
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:48,684
在哪儿找的这个工作?分类广告里?
Where do you get these jobs? On Craigslist?

1798
01:20:48,840 --> 01:20:50,763
先生 你没必要这么瞧不起人
Okay, sir, we don't need to demean each other here.

1799
01:20:50,920 --> 01:20:52,285
你一个字我都不相信
I don't believe a word you're saying.

1800
01:20:52,920 --> 01:20:54,206
让我看看
Let me see it.

1801
01:20:54,800 --> 01:20:56,564
我不在乎给你看看
I have no problem showing you this.

1802
01:20:56,720 --> 01:20:59,166
如果你想看 那就做好心理准备了
So if you wanna see it then get ready to see.

1803
01:20:59,520 --> 01:21:01,443
- 我要打开了  - 打开吧
- Here I go. - Go for it.

1804
01:21:02,760 --> 01:21:05,604
天啊 天啊
Oh, shit! Oh, shit.

1805
01:21:05,760 --> 01:21:08,206
我开玩笑的 这是我朋友
I'm just kidding. This is my friend.

1806
01:21:08,560 --> 01:21:10,244
- 噢  - 是我哥们
- Oh! - It's my buddy.

1807
01:21:10,480 --> 01:21:12,289
它叫吉伦哈尔蛇
His name's Snake Gyllenhaal.

1808
01:21:12,480 --> 01:21:14,482
- 它看守我的午餐  - 好了 够了
- He guards my lunch. - Okay, that's enough.

1809
01:21:38,200 --> 01:21:39,611
肯定是哈里斯吧
It's gotta be Harris, right?

1810
01:21:40,880 --> 01:21:41,927
你什么意思
What do you mean?

1811
01:21:42,120 --> 01:21:43,645
大黑獾肯定就是她
I mean, she's gotta be The Black Badger.

1812
01:21:43,800 --> 01:21:44,961
这是唯一合情合理的
It's the only thing that makes sense.

1813
01:21:45,120 --> 01:21:46,884
她能接触到密码
I mean, she's had access to the encryption codes

1814
01:21:47,040 --> 01:21:49,691
而且她这么急切的要嫁祸于你
and she's so hot and bothered about pinning this whole thing on you.

1815
01:21:49,880 --> 01:21:50,961
肯定是她
It's gotta be her!

1816
01:21:51,120 --> 01:21:52,645
我不知道 杰.
I don't know, Jet.

1817
01:21:52,840 --> 01:21:54,729
她肯定认为我是大黑獾
I'm pretty sure she thinks I'm The Black Badger.

1818
01:21:54,880 --> 01:21:56,928
在审讯室一直盘问我这事
She worked me over pretty good in that interrogation room.

1819
01:21:57,080 --> 01:21:59,162
等等 怎么回事
Hold on, wait, wait... What's going on?

1820
01:21:59,520 --> 01:22:01,966
这是怎么回事 鲍勃
What's that? What's going on right now, Bob?

1821
01:22:02,120 --> 01:22:04,282
没什么 我们没一点燃油了
No biggie. We're completely outta gas.

1822
01:22:04,480 --> 01:22:05,970
天啊
Oh, my... Oh!

1823
01:22:07,920 --> 01:22:10,207
我们要坠机了, 杰! 我无能为力!
We're going down, Jet! There's nothing I can do!

1824
01:22:10,400 --> 01:22:13,006
- 该死  - 问你个小问题
- Oh, shit! - Really quickly...

1825
01:22:13,160 --> 01:22:16,767
你这辈子最后悔的事是什么
What's the one thing you wish you'd done in your life?

1826
01:22:16,920 --> 01:22:19,287
我最后悔的是跟着一个
The one thing I wish I hadn't done is not get in a plane with a guy

1827
01:22:19,440 --> 01:22:21,363
没检查燃油的人上了飞机
who didn't check the goddamned fuel!

1828
01:22:21,520 --> 01:22:24,490
- 你为什么没检查燃油  - 不 我问的是现实中
- Why wouldn't you check the fuel? - No, something that's real.

1829
01:22:24,640 --> 01:22:27,086
你最后悔的一件事是什么
What's the one thing you regret not doing for you?

1830
01:22:27,240 --> 01:22:29,402
天啊 我们好像要死了
Oh, my God! I think we're gonna die!

1831
01:22:34,120 --> 01:22:36,088
是没有孩子
Not having a kid, man!

1832
01:22:36,600 --> 01:22:37,806
没当上爹
Not being a father!

1833
01:22:37,960 --> 01:22:40,327
我后悔没当爹
I regret not being a father!

1834
01:22:40,480 --> 01:22:42,369
麦吉 我该给你个孩子的
Maggie, I should've gave you a kid!

1835
01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:45,006
我该把我的种给你 麦吉
I should've gave you my seed, Maggie!

1836
01:22:45,160 --> 01:22:46,571
我应该的
I should've!

1837
01:22:46,720 --> 01:22:48,085
我真自私
I'm so selfish!

1838
01:22:49,480 --> 01:22:51,482
对不起 麦吉
I'm sorry, Maggie!

1839
01:22:55,640 --> 01:22:57,927
- 这不是很难啊  - 什么
- That wasn't so hard, right? - What?

1840
01:22:58,080 --> 01:22:59,809
我得说
Hey, just for the record,

1841
01:22:59,960 --> 01:23:01,644
我觉得你会是个好爸爸
I think you'd make a great dad.

1842
01:23:02,280 --> 01:23:04,089
这都是你假装的?
Did you just fake this whole thing?

1843
01:23:04,760 --> 01:23:05,761
是的 差不多
Yeah, kinda.

1844
01:23:05,920 --> 01:23:07,570
不会吧
You gotta be shitting me glory!

1845
01:23:07,720 --> 01:23:09,210
没有
No, not at all.

1846
01:23:09,360 --> 01:23:11,442
我只是觉得当你面临绝境的时候
I just thought that maybe a facing-your-own-death situation

1847
01:23:11,600 --> 01:23:14,683
可能会帮你明白你的人生目标是什么
might help motivate you to clarify some of your goals in life.

1848
01:23:14,880 --> 01:23:16,405
说句私心话
And, hey, between me and you,

1849
01:23:16,880 --> 01:23:18,564
我知道你对这问题一直很纠结
I know you've been struggling a little bit.

1850
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:21,207
知道我现在纠结什么吗
You know what I'm struggling with right now, Bob?

1851
01:23:21,360 --> 01:23:22,850
到底要不要揍你
Not whooping your ass.

1852
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:25,082
好吧, 杰. 你哭的时候挺可爱的.
Okay, Jet. Hey, you're really cute when you cry.

1853
01:23:25,240 --> 01:23:27,163
行了 够了
Stop it! Enough!

1854
01:23:34,059 --> 01:23:36,269
波士顿公园

1855
01:23:40,800 --> 01:23:42,006
我不明白
I don't get it.

1856
01:23:42,200 --> 01:23:45,482
如果这坐标正确, 我们就在这坐标上.
I mean, if these coordinates are correct, we should be standing right on top of it.

1857
01:23:43,360 --> 01:23:45,445


1858
01:23:45,640 --> 01:23:48,530
交易是在30分钟后
The deal doesn't go down for another 30 minutes, Jet,

1859
01:23:48,680 --> 01:23:51,206
- 我们是来早了  - 不会
- so we're kinda early. - No!

1860
01:23:51,360 --> 01:23:52,725
为什么要在这空旷的地方交易
Why would you do it out in the open like this?

1861
01:23:52,920 --> 01:23:54,445
为什么要冒这个风险
Why would you take that risk?

1862
01:23:54,600 --> 01:23:56,284
这没道理啊
Just doesn't make any sense, man.

1863
01:23:57,600 --> 01:23:59,284
该死 拜托
Shit! Come on.

1864
01:24:01,320 --> 01:24:02,367
等等
Wait.

1865
01:24:04,040 --> 01:24:05,929
等等 不是在这里交易
Oh, wait. It's not happening up here.

1866
01:24:07,720 --> 01:24:09,131
不是的
No, it's not. It's...

1867
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,571
而是在我们脚下
Oh, it's happening beneath us. Look.

1868
01:24:14,720 --> 01:24:16,609
看 那是个地下停车场
It's an underground parking garage.

1869
01:24:17,520 --> 01:24:18,965
好眼力, 杰.
Yeah, that's a good eye, Jet.

1870
01:24:19,480 --> 01:24:21,721
你还是留在这里放哨
Why don't you stay up here? Keep overwatch.

1871
01:24:21,880 --> 01:24:23,370
我下去看看
I'll go down there and check things out.

1872
01:24:23,520 --> 01:24:25,363
等等 什么 我跟你一起去
Wait, what? No, I'm going with you.

1873
01:24:25,520 --> 01:24:28,285
你不能和我一起去 我们分散行动才更妥当
You can't go with me. The smarter play is if we split up.

1874
01:24:28,440 --> 01:24:29,646
妥当什么
Smarter play for who?

1875
01:24:30,080 --> 01:24:31,730
知道人们分散后会怎么样吗
Do you know what happens when people split up, Bob?

1876
01:24:31,920 --> 01:24:32,967
会有人死
Somebody dies!

1877
01:24:33,120 --> 01:24:34,531
死的那个人是我
I'd be the one to die. You know why?

1878
01:24:34,680 --> 01:24:37,081
因为我没防弹背心 也没有枪
Because I don't have a bulletproof vest and I don't have a gun!

1879
01:24:37,240 --> 01:24:38,890
那么你就是我的防弹背心
Which means that you are my bulletproof vest!

1880
01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:41,441
我要跟着你 你不能离开我
My little black ass is gonna stay behind you, you're not leaving me!

1881
01:24:41,600 --> 01:24:43,489
所以你才要留在这里
That's exactly why you should stay up here.

1882
01:24:43,680 --> 01:24:46,001
如果你去停车场中枪死了
Look, if you went down in that garage and you got shot to death,

1883
01:24:46,160 --> 01:24:47,321
知道我会多伤心吗
you know how hurt I would be?

1884
01:24:47,480 --> 01:24:49,130
我会很郁闷的 我不希望那样
I'd be super bummed out! I don't want that.

1885
01:24:49,280 --> 01:24:50,884
你在上面更安全
It's safer for you up here.

1886
01:24:51,040 --> 01:24:52,929
如果这里出事了 我该怎么办
If something happened up here, what am I supposed to do, Bob?

1887
01:24:53,080 --> 01:24:55,208
我该怎么呼唤你 学鸟叫?
How do I get your attention? Make a bird call?

1888
01:24:57,520 --> 01:24:59,602
你听像鸟叫吗
Does that sound like a bird to you? Huh?

1889
01:24:59,760 --> 01:25:01,649
这是我最大的弱点 我不会学鸟叫
That's my biggest weakness! I can't make bird noises.

1890
01:25:01,800 --> 01:25:02,847
从来都不会
I never could.

1891
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:04,764
如果我活命只能靠鸟叫
So if that's what I gotta depend on to live,

1892
01:25:04,920 --> 01:25:07,764
那我肯定会死 孤零零死在这里
it means I'm gonna die! I'mma die up here, by myself

1893
01:25:07,920 --> 01:25:10,241
像死去鸽子的声音
sounding like a dead-ass pigeon.

1894
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,606
- 我不知道鸽子什么叫声  - 杰, 杰, 杰, 杰, 杰!
- I have no idea what a pigeon... - Jet, Jet, Jet, Jet, Jet!

1895
01:25:14,760 --> 01:25:16,444
你不用学鸟叫
You don't have to make bird noises.

1896
01:25:16,600 --> 01:25:17,601
也不用学鸽子
You don't have to sound like a pigeon.

1897
01:25:17,760 --> 01:25:22,609
你只需要用加密手机给我打电话 就在你手上
All you gotta do is call me on the encrypted phone that's in your hand.

1898
01:25:20,791 --> 01:25:22,584


1899
01:25:27,200 --> 01:25:28,565
- 好吗  - 好
- Okay? - Okay, yeah.

1900
01:25:29,040 --> 01:25:30,405
- 我很快就回来  - 好
- I'll be right back. - Okay.

1901
01:25:30,600 --> 01:25:31,761
好吗
All right?

1902
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:33,206
对了, 杰.
Oh, Jet.

1903
01:25:34,720 --> 01:25:36,404
我们来世再见
I'll see you on the other side.

1904
01:25:37,240 --> 01:25:38,241
好
Yeah.

1905
01:25:38,560 --> 01:25:39,561
好
Yeah.

1906
01:26:05,720 --> 01:26:06,801
你来早了
You're early.

1907
01:26:07,480 --> 01:26:09,084
你也是
So are you.

1908
01:26:11,720 --> 01:26:13,085
快点
Come on.

1909
01:26:23,760 --> 01:26:25,091
天啊
Oh, my God!

1910
01:26:28,920 --> 01:26:30,809
天啊
Oh, my God.

1911
01:26:31,640 --> 01:26:32,641
我就知道
I knew it.

1912
01:26:32,800 --> 01:26:35,167
我就知道她就是大黑獾
I knew it. I knew she was The Black Badger!

1913
01:26:35,320 --> 01:26:36,970
天啊
Oh, my God!

1914
01:26:37,480 --> 01:26:39,608
接电话 接电话
Pick up the phone. Pick up the phone.

1915
01:26:39,760 --> 01:26:40,761
喂

1916
01:26:40,960 --> 01:26:43,566
鲍勃·哈里斯就是大黑獾
Bob, Harris is The Black Badger!

1917
01:26:43,760 --> 01:26:44,761
喂
Hello?

1918
01:26:45,120 --> 01:26:46,531
哈里斯就是大黑獾
Harris is The Black Badger!

1919
01:26:46,720 --> 01:26:47,767
我听不见你
I can't hear you.

1920
01:26:47,920 --> 01:26:49,763
哈里斯就是大黑獾
Harris is The Black Badger!

1921
01:26:51,120 --> 01:26:53,646
开玩笑的 我不在 请留言
Just kidding! I'm not here. Leave a message at the beep.

1922
01:26:53,800 --> 01:26:54,801
什么
What?

1923
01:27:05,120 --> 01:27:06,645
哈里斯就是大黑獾
Oh. Harris is The Black Badger!

1924
01:27:06,800 --> 01:27:08,450
哈里斯就是大黑獾
Harris is The Black Badger!

1925
01:27:08,600 --> 01:27:10,921
我就知道 哈里斯就是大黑獾
I knew it. I knew it. Harris is The Black Badger!

1926
01:27:12,120 --> 01:27:14,248
鲍勃·哈里斯是…
Bob! Harris is The...

1927
01:27:15,720 --> 01:27:16,721
他是谁
Who is he?

1928
01:27:17,160 --> 01:27:18,161
他是我搭档
That's my partner.

1929
01:27:32,040 --> 01:27:33,610
我不喜欢跟人分成
I don't like splitting my fees.

1930
01:27:35,280 --> 01:27:38,443
那包裹 请
The package. Please.

1931
01:27:39,600 --> 01:27:41,250
就等你问了
Thought you'd never ask.

1932
01:27:41,480 --> 01:27:44,882
等等 你搞错了
Wait! You're making a mistake.

1933
01:27:46,440 --> 01:27:48,124
你好 鲍勃
Hello, Bob.

1934
01:27:49,800 --> 01:27:51,404
你不是死了吗
But you're dead.

1935
01:27:51,560 --> 01:27:53,608
不像别人以为的那样
Not as much as people think.

1936
01:27:54,360 --> 01:27:57,125
听着 他不是大黑獾
Look, he's not The Black Badger...

1937
01:27:57,800 --> 01:27:58,801
我才是
I am.

1938
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:01,128
这也不是密码
And those aren't the encryption codes,

1939
01:28:01,280 --> 01:28:02,611
这才是
these are.

1940
01:28:02,760 --> 01:28:03,886
他在骗你
He's lying to you.

1941
01:28:04,040 --> 01:28:05,530
此人是个中情局特工
This man is a CIA agent,

1942
01:28:05,880 --> 01:28:07,370
他想把冒牌货卖给你
and he's trying to sell you bogus plans.

1943
01:28:14,720 --> 01:28:15,767
该死
Damn.

1944
01:28:17,720 --> 01:28:19,051
啊
Ow, ow.

1945
01:28:22,640 --> 01:28:23,721
他射了我
He shot me.

1946
01:28:27,640 --> 01:28:29,802
这才是真正的密码
These are the real codes

1947
01:28:30,640 --> 01:28:32,244
我才是真正的大黑獾
and I am the real Black Badger.

1948
01:28:36,360 --> 01:28:37,850
大黑獾是鲍勃
Bob is The Black Badger.

1949
01:28:39,520 --> 01:28:40,681
大黑獾是鲍勃
Bob is The Black Badger.

1950
01:28:40,840 --> 01:28:42,922
我才是大黑獾
I am The Black Badger.

1951
01:28:43,400 --> 01:28:44,606
菲尔?
Phil?

1952
01:28:45,840 --> 01:28:48,411
不 我才是大黑獾
No, I'm The Black Badger.

1953
01:28:48,560 --> 01:28:51,564
我开始觉得大黑獾可能是我
I'm starting to think I might be The Black Badger.

1954
01:28:53,800 --> 01:28:55,450
这样吧
Here's the thing.

1955
01:28:55,640 --> 01:28:58,723
我不知道谁才是真正的大黑獾
I have no idea who is the real Black Badger.

1956
01:28:59,760 --> 01:29:01,285
我也不关心
And I don't care.

1957
01:29:01,480 --> 01:29:02,970
因为我是蜜獾
'Cause I'm The Honey Badger.

1958
01:29:03,120 --> 01:29:05,043
而蜜獾什么都不在乎
And The Honey Badger doesn't give a shit.

1959
01:29:05,200 --> 01:29:06,804
蜜獾不择手段
The Honey Badger's nasty.

1960
01:29:06,960 --> 01:29:09,645
所以他两个都要
He's so nasty, he'll take them both.

1961
01:29:10,160 --> 01:29:11,161
交过来
Hand them over.

1962
01:29:11,720 --> 01:29:13,927
菲尔 等这件事一过
Phil, when this thing is over,

1963
01:29:14,080 --> 01:29:18,130
我就像"威龙杀阵"中的派屈克·史威兹一样撕碎你的喉咙
I'm going to rip your throat out like Patrick Swayze in Road House.

1964
01:29:18,280 --> 01:29:19,645
天啊 又是"威龙杀阵"
Oh, my God. You and Road House.

1965
01:29:19,800 --> 01:29:20,847
别再提这部电影了
Get over that movie.

1966
01:29:21,040 --> 01:29:22,769
当时是烂片 现在也是烂片
It sucked then, it sucks now.

1967
01:29:23,280 --> 01:29:24,611
派屈克·史威兹算个屁
Fuck Patrick Swayze!

1968
01:29:25,600 --> 01:29:26,726
你怎么能这么说
How dare you!

1969
01:29:32,040 --> 01:29:33,451
放下你们的武器
Drop your weapons!

1970
01:29:39,200 --> 01:29:40,247
噢 天啊
Oh! Oh, shit!

1971
01:29:52,560 --> 01:29:53,721
密码
The codes.

1972
01:29:54,120 --> 01:29:55,246
别这么做
Don't do it.

1973
01:29:55,880 --> 01:29:56,961
这太傻了
Stupid.

1974
01:29:59,400 --> 01:30:00,401
好
Okay.

1975
01:30:00,960 --> 01:30:02,007
一
One,

1976
01:30:03,040 --> 01:30:04,041
二
two,

1977
01:30:05,400 --> 01:30:06,401
三 靠
three! Shit!

1978
01:30:11,720 --> 01:30:13,404
噢 噢
Uh-oh! Oh!

1979
01:30:13,920 --> 01:30:14,921
不
No!

1980
01:30:15,400 --> 01:30:16,526
他拿着密码
He's got the codes!

1981
01:30:51,520 --> 01:30:52,521
哇
Whoo!

1982
01:30:52,960 --> 01:30:54,610
真是惊险啊
I mean, this is crazy, right?

1983
01:30:54,960 --> 01:30:56,121
你离我远点 鲍勃
You stay the hell away from me, Bob!

1984
01:30:56,280 --> 01:30:57,566
你射了我的脖子
You shot me in the neck!

1985
01:31:00,600 --> 01:31:01,601
杰!
Jet!

1986
01:31:22,880 --> 01:31:23,927
好
Okay.

1987
01:31:28,320 --> 01:31:30,482
黄金喷气机绝杀投球
Golden Jet for the win!

1988
01:31:32,120 --> 01:31:33,645
该死
No. Shit!

1989
01:31:33,840 --> 01:31:35,205
放下武器 鲍勃
Drop your weapon, Bob.

1990
01:31:36,400 --> 01:31:37,401
该死
Oh, shit!

1991
01:31:37,560 --> 01:31:39,130
到我身后 乔伊纳先生
Get behind me, Mr. Joyner.

1992
01:31:39,560 --> 01:31:40,925
别这么做, 杰.
Ah, you don't wanna do that, Jet.

1993
01:31:41,160 --> 01:31:42,446
他显然是坏人
It's obvious he's the bad guy.

1994
01:31:42,640 --> 01:31:44,085
我是好人 你要到我身后
I'm the good guy. You wanna get behind me.

1995
01:31:44,240 --> 01:31:46,083
哈里斯特工让我潜伏
Agent Harris had me go dark

1996
01:31:46,240 --> 01:31:49,323
好让鲍勃暴露出他大黑獾的身份
to get Bob to reveal himself as The Black Badger.

1997
01:31:49,520 --> 01:31:51,124
你不会相信他的吧
You don't seriously believe this guy, do you?

1998
01:31:51,280 --> 01:31:52,441
到我身后, 杰.
You wanna get behind me, Jet.

1999
01:31:52,600 --> 01:31:54,329
你背叛了国家, 鲍勃.
You betrayed your nation, Bob.

2000
01:31:54,680 --> 01:31:57,001
你背叛了你的搭档, 菲尔.
You betrayed your partner, Phil.

2001
01:31:57,160 --> 01:32:00,528
等等 大家都住手
Okay, no, wait! Everybody just stop!

2002
01:32:00,680 --> 01:32:01,727
别说废话了
Cut the shit!

2003
01:32:02,280 --> 01:32:03,930
我现在就打断
I'mma cut the line right now!

2004
01:32:04,120 --> 01:32:05,485
别说废话了
I cut the shit!

2005
01:32:05,640 --> 01:32:07,529
我不管谁背叛了谁
Hear me? Now I don't care who betrayed who.

2006
01:32:07,680 --> 01:32:09,125
我只是不想受到伤害
Okay? I just don't wanna get hurt!

2007
01:32:09,560 --> 01:32:12,086
因此都不要…该死
So there ain't gonna be no... Shit!

2008
01:32:20,960 --> 01:32:21,961
快
Come on.

2009
01:32:37,840 --> 01:32:38,841
该死
Shi...

2010
01:32:43,520 --> 01:32:44,521
该死
Shit.

2011
01:33:03,240 --> 01:33:05,322
明智之举 乔伊纳先生
Smart move, Mr. Joyner.

2012
01:33:05,480 --> 01:33:07,767
你为国出力了
You've done your country a great service.

2013
01:33:07,920 --> 01:33:10,127
现在给我枪
Now, hand me the firearm

2014
01:33:10,280 --> 01:33:13,523
我们一起把卫星密码上交
and we'll turn over the satellite codes together.

2015
01:33:13,920 --> 01:33:17,527
站着别动 别向前迈一步
Stay right there, man. Don't you take another step.

2016
01:33:17,760 --> 01:33:20,081
我虽然射了他 不等于就信任你
Just because I shot him does not mean I trust you.

2017
01:33:20,480 --> 01:33:21,641
我们没时间解释
We don't have time for this.

2018
01:33:21,840 --> 01:33:24,605
站住 我让你站住
Stop! I said, "Stop."

2019
01:33:25,360 --> 01:33:27,124
可惜啊
Aw, whoopsie.

2020
01:33:31,320 --> 01:33:33,368
扔的漂亮 小子
Nice throw, bitch.

2021
01:33:38,080 --> 01:33:42,608
你知道为什么你朋友鲍勃没当成大黑獾吗
You wanna know why your pal Bob could never have been The Black Badger?

2022
01:33:43,760 --> 01:33:45,888
因为他太软弱
It's because he's too weak.

2023
01:33:46,040 --> 01:33:48,361
如果我再听他说一遍
And if I had to hear another goddamned story

2024
01:33:48,520 --> 01:33:51,729
黄金喷气机加尔文·乔伊纳
about Calvin "The Golden Jet" Joyner

2025
01:33:51,880 --> 01:33:54,042
说你在高中多么牛逼
and how awesome you were in high school

2026
01:33:54,200 --> 01:33:56,806
说你是这个大白痴最好的朋友
and how you were this big idiot's best friend,

2027
01:33:56,960 --> 01:33:58,485
我真要发疯了
I was just gonna lose it.

2028
01:33:59,760 --> 01:34:03,082
看你现在 看起来一点也不牛逼
Looking at you right now, you don't seem so cool.

2029
01:34:03,280 --> 01:34:06,727
就像个平凡的人
You just seem like a regular guy.

2030
01:34:07,160 --> 01:34:08,605
一个普通人
An everyday Joe.

2031
01:34:09,480 --> 01:34:13,087
装死还倒好说
You know, faking my own death was the easy part.

2032
01:34:13,960 --> 01:34:17,248
最痛苦的是整天听鲍勃叽叽歪歪
But dealing with Bob, day after day, was the hard part.

2033
01:34:17,400 --> 01:34:18,401
喂 菲尔
Hey, Phil.

2034
01:34:18,560 --> 01:34:19,641
怎么了 鲍勃
What, Bob?

2035
01:34:20,560 --> 01:34:22,403
我们来世再见
I'll see you on the other side.

2036
01:34:23,080 --> 01:34:25,401
不 希望我们别再见了
No, I hope we don't. All right?

2037
01:34:25,560 --> 01:34:27,130
别了 再见 再见
Just, no. Bye, bye, bye.

2038
01:34:27,280 --> 01:34:28,281
你就走吧
Just go.

2039
01:34:28,440 --> 01:34:31,171
我编造出大黑獾 安装了个血袋
I made up the Black Badger, rigged up a blood bag

2040
01:34:31,320 --> 01:34:32,401
这个大笨蛋真信了
and that big dummy bought it.

2041

这里有个炸弹
No, there's some sort of bomb in here.

2044
01:34:38,080 --> 01:34:39,969
你好像把门挤紧了
You're pushing it closed, I think.

2045
01:34:40,120 --> 01:34:42,202
- 没有抱歉  - 不 别放弃

跪下 黄金喷气机
On your knees, Golden Jet.

2053
01:35:11,080 --> 01:35:12,286
这是搞什么
What the hell was that?

2054
01:35:14,120 --> 01:35:15,770
黄金喷气机后空翻
Golden Jet flip.

2055
01:35:16,280 --> 01:35:19,204
是吗 你翻的很差劲
Yeah? Well, you really suck at it.

2056
01:35:19,400 --> 01:35:20,640
我知道
I know.

2057
01:35:20,800 --> 01:35:22,484
那你干嘛还要翻
Then why'd you do it?

2058
01:35:22,640 --> 01:35:23,641
分散注意力
Distraction.

2059
01:35:27,680 --> 01:35:29,011
啊 你撕碎了他的喉咙
Oh, you just pulled his throat out!

2060

杰, 来. 我拉你起来.
Jet, come here. Give me your hand, old buddy.

2062
01:35:40,080 --> 01:35:41,809
天啊 把那东西拿开
Oh, shit! Get that away from me!

2063
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:43,161
抱歉, 杰.
Sorry, Jet.

2064
01:35:44,200 --> 01:35:46,487
来, 杰. 那是个气管.
Come here, Jet. That was a trachea.

2065
01:35:46,640 --> 01:35:48,165
很好的分散注意力
Great distraction, man!

2066
01:35:48,320 --> 01:35:49,765
对不起我射了你
Sorry I had to shoot you, Jet.

2067
01:35:49,920 --> 01:35:51,649
只有那样才能救你一命
It was the only way I could save your life.

2068
01:35:51,800 --> 01:35:54,007
但你射了我 诱使菲尔供认出
But when you shot me to get Phil to confess

2069
01:35:54,160 --> 01:35:57,648
他就是大黑獾, 比我更是高明的多.
that he was The Black Badger, that was some next-level-type shit!

2070
01:35:55,676 --> 01:35:57,594


2071
01:35:57,800 --> 01:36:01,566
是啊 很高兴你能明白我的用意
Yeah, no. I'm glad you see it the way I saw it.

2072
01:36:01,720 --> 01:36:03,688
全都是我一手安排的
That was my plan the whole time. So...

2073
01:36:03,840 --> 01:36:05,524
你很有干这行的天赋
You are a natural for this line of work.

2074
01:36:05,680 --> 01:36:08,247
你有学识, 有技能, 善于跟人打交道.
I mean, you're smart, you got the skill set, you're a people person.

2075
01:36:07,187 --> 01:36:08,230


2076
01:36:08,400 --> 01:36:11,688
而且你已经有了一个很牛逼的绰号黄金喷气机 哇
and you already got a dope-ass code name, "The Golden Jet!" What?

2077

交给哈里斯 否则就要迟到了
over to Harris right away or we're gonna be late.

2079
01:36:15,840 --> 01:36:18,207
你说什么呢 什么迟到了
What are you talking about? Late for what?

2080
01:36:20,200 --> 01:36:25,127
同学聚会啊 已经开始了

2089
01:37:01,040 --> 01:37:03,930
很抱歉伤了你的手 希望你知道那不是针对你
I'm really sorry about your hand. I hope you know that wasn't personal.

2090

我完全没放在心上 帕梅拉
Oh, no hard feelings at all, Pam.

而且人人都会犯错误
Besides, everybody makes mistakes.

2092
01:37:07,880 --> 01:37:09,882
加尔文还以为你是大黑獾呢

我们在飞机上时 你说：大黑獾就是哈里斯
When we were in the plane, you said, "Hey, Harris is the Black..."

If I were to give you a call, how would I get in touch with you?

我以为我的人生很失败

2122
01:38:16,720 --> 01:38:19,041

因为有你

Guys, this isn't a good idea. You know what?

2135
01:39:16,440 --> 01:39:18,761
我们回头见 我不该来的
I'll just meet you later. I shouldn't have come.

2136
01:39:18,920 --> 01:39:19,921
等等 等等
Wait, wait, wait.

2137

我去小便, 杰.
I really gotta pee, Jet.

2149
01:39:50,840 --> 01:39:52,330

No, scratch that I said that.

2164
01:40:35,560 --> 01:40:37,130
本来很牛逼的话 听起来很装逼
It was supposed to come out cool. It didn't.

2165
01:40:37,280 --> 01:40:38,520
本来按我的设计…
It was something I thought of, it was like a...

2175
01:40:56,960 --> 01:40:58,007
- 没事的  - 我受够了
- It's all right. - No, I've had it!

2176
01:40:58,160 --> 01:40:59,764
- 我来处理, 杰. - 没事的.
- I got it, Jet. It's okay. - It's okay.

2177
01:40:59,920 --> 01:41:01,046
我来处理
I'll handle it.

2178
01:41:01,320 --> 01:41:05,245
等等 我可不相信什么
Whoa, whoa! Hang on. I'm not buying this whole transformation

2179
01:41:05,400 --> 01:41:07,004
丑小鸭变成白天鹅
from ugly duckling into swan.

2180
01:41:07,200 --> 01:41:08,201
这里没人相信
No one in here is.

2181
01:41:08,360 --> 01:41:11,807
就算你驾着直升机来 西装革履的
You can fly in, in a bunch of helicopters and dress up in a thousand suits,

2182
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:15,607
但在我们大家看来 你永远都是那个胖小子
but to everybody, including me, you'll always just be the fat kid.

2183
01:41:18,880 --> 01:41:20,291
这事我考虑了很多 特雷弗
I've been thinking about this a lot, Trevor.

2184
01:41:21,520 --> 01:41:24,761
我只想对你说我原谅你
And the only thing I want to say to you is I forgive you.

2185
01:41:23,754 --> 01:41:24,755


2186
01:41:25,320 --> 01:41:27,846
你原谅我 天啊 原谅我什么
You forgive me! Oh, boy! For what?

2187
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:29,525
原谅我很牛逼吗
For being rad as shit.

2188
01:41:29,680 --> 01:41:30,886
去你的吧 胖小子
Fuck you, fat boy.

2189
01:41:31,080 --> 01:41:32,491
依然是个胆小鬼
Still a scared little bitch.

2190
01:41:36,800 --> 01:41:38,006
我讨厌仗势欺人
I don't like bullies.

2191
01:41:41,800 --> 01:41:44,041
他是叫鲍勃·斯通小子
And the name is Bob Stone, bitch!

2192
01:41:44,360 --> 01:41:45,361
哇
Whoo-whoo!

2193
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:47,411
来 迈过去
Come on, baby. Step over.

2194
01:41:51,360 --> 01:41:52,521
大家好
Hi, everybody!

2195
01:41:53,480 --> 01:41:56,962
你们都知道我在高中时是
Most of you knew me back in high school as

2196
01:41:57,920 --> 01:41:59,410
怪鸡鸡鲍勃
Robbie Wheirdicht.

2197
01:41:59,600 --> 01:42:01,523
- 他是怪鸡鸡鲍勃?  - 不会吧
- That's Robbie Wheirdicht? - No way!

2198
01:42:01,680 --> 01:42:03,728
我每天穿着处方裤子
I wore prescription pants every day.

2199
01:42:05,800 --> 01:42:08,041
20年前 在这个体育馆里
Twenty years ago, in this gym,

2200
01:42:09,240 --> 01:42:11,208
我站在你们面前
I stood in front of you all

2201
01:42:12,040 --> 01:42:13,166
光着身子
naked

2202
01:42:13,880 --> 01:42:15,291
羞愧不堪
and embarrassed.

2203
01:42:16,240 --> 01:42:18,163
你们可能还有人记得那一天
Some of you might remember that day.

2204
01:42:19,360 --> 01:42:21,488
可能很多人当时还笑了
A lot of you probably even laughed.

2205
01:42:22,480 --> 01:42:24,130
但没关系
But that's okay.

2206
01:42:25,240 --> 01:42:27,846
今晚将会不同 因为
Tonight's gonna be different because

2207
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:31,083
我最好的朋友也一起来了
my best friend is here with me.

2208
01:42:33,240 --> 01:42:38,406
他教会我做自己故事里的英雄是什么意思
And he taught me what it means to be the hero of your own story.

2209
01:42:41,160 --> 01:42:42,525
能帮我拿一下吗
Would you hold this for me, please?

2210
01:42:44,240 --> 01:42:46,163
做自己故事里的英雄
Being the hero of your own story

2211
01:42:46,320 --> 01:42:50,689
不一定非要惩奸除恶 或者征服大山
isn't about stopping bad guys or climbing mountains.

2212
01:42:50,840 --> 01:42:53,969
关键是克服那些欺压自己的
It's about overcoming bullies in your life,

2213
01:42:54,120 --> 01:42:57,044
不管是人还是什么
whatever or whomever they may be.

2214
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:00,685
关键是敞开心扉
It's about putting it all out there

2215
01:43:01,360 --> 01:43:02,407
让所有人
for everyone

2216
01:43:03,760 --> 01:43:04,921
都能看到
to see.

2217
01:43:05,760 --> 01:43:07,603
关键是明白
And it's realizing that, in life,

2218
01:43:07,760 --> 01:43:10,127
你能做到的最重要的
the most important thing that you can be

2219
01:43:11,240 --> 01:43:12,321
就是做你自己
is yourself.

2220
01:43:13,080 --> 01:43:17,404
因此 中央高中 1996届的同学们
So, Central High, Class of 1996,

2221
01:43:18,360 --> 01:43:21,250
这就是我 怪鸡鸡鲍勃
this is me, Robbie Wheirdicht.

2222
01:43:32,520 --> 01:43:35,126
天啊 鲍勃脱光了
Oh, my God! Bob just went commando!

2223
01:43:36,960 --> 01:43:38,564
好 好
Yes! Yes!

2224
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:44,604
好样的 鲍勃
Way to go, Bob!

2225
01:43:45,480 --> 01:43:46,720
做你自己
Be you!

2226
01:43:47,240 --> 01:43:49,322
鲍勃 鲍勃
Robbie! Robbie! Robbie!

2227
01:43:49,480 --> 01:43:52,484
鲍勃 鲍勃
Robbie! Robbie! Robbie!

2228
01:43:58,000 --> 01:43:59,161
嗨
Hey, man!

2229
01:43:59,320 --> 01:44:01,527
说的太棒了 我真为你高兴
Dude, this is amazing! I'm so happy for you!

2230
01:44:01,680 --> 01:44:03,409
谢谢 我感觉好自由
Thank you, Jet! I feel so free!

2231
01:44:03,920 --> 01:44:04,967
- 来  - 不 不
- Come here. - No, no, no.

2232
01:44:05,120 --> 01:44:06,884
你的鸡鸡出来了
Your junk is out.

2233
01:44:07,240 --> 01:44:09,811
- 对不起, 杰.  - 打扰一下
- Oh. Sorry, Jet. - Excuse me.

2234
01:44:12,240 --> 01:44:13,605
嗨 鲍勃
Hi, Robbie.

2235
01:44:14,680 --> 01:44:16,762
- 你应该不记得我了  - 达拉
- You probably don't remember me. - Darla.

2236
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:20,048
- 她是达拉·莫佳肯?  - 是的
- Is that Darla McGuckian? - Yeah.

2237
01:44:20,200 --> 01:44:22,487
哇 她真好看
Wow! She looks great!

2238
01:44:22,840 --> 01:44:24,205
她以前不是有个眼睛弱视吗
Didn't she used to have a lazy eye?

2239
01:44:24,400 --> 01:44:25,731
- 两个都是  - 哇
- Two of them. - Wow.

2240
01:44:25,880 --> 01:44:27,962
没想到你还记得我
I can't believe you remember me.

2241
01:44:28,120 --> 01:44:29,610
记得?
Remember you?

2242
01:44:29,760 --> 01:44:31,330
我怎么可能忘记你
How could I forget you?

2243
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:35,800
你还是那个甜蜜的笑容 那个甜蜜的脸
You still have the same sweet smile, the same sweet face.

2244
01:44:36,360 --> 01:44:39,204
但你发型变了 你以前是卷发
But your hair's changed. You used to wear it curlier.

2245
01:44:39,360 --> 01:44:40,600
但我喜欢你现在
I like it though.

2246
01:44:41,040 --> 01:44:42,690
你一点都没变
You haven't changed at all.

2247
01:44:42,880 --> 01:44:44,405
胡说
Oh, I don't know.

2248
01:44:50,520 --> 01:44:52,363
你依然和以前一样美
You're still as beautiful as ever.

2249
01:44:52,680 --> 01:44:53,681
啊
Oh.

2250
01:45:03,040 --> 01:45:04,769
- 耶 鲍勃  - 加油 鲍勃
- Yeah, Bob! - Go, Bob!

2251
01:45:05,760 --> 01:45:07,250
不 不
No, no, no.

2252
01:45:14,480 --> 01:45:16,562
啊 我头晕目眩
Oh, I got spinny.

2253
01:45:16,760 --> 01:45:18,569
头晕的要命
Super spinny.

2254
01:45:21,160 --> 01:45:22,969
感觉真好
Yeah, that's nice.

2255
01:45:23,640 --> 01:45:26,405
- 我能带你去买冰淇淋吗  - 可以
- Can I take you to get ice-cream... - Yes.

2256
01:45:27,240 --> 01:45:29,242
可以 可以
Yes. Yes, yes, yes.

2257
01:45:29,840 --> 01:45:32,844
我特别不耐乳糖 但我豁出去了
Super lactose intolerant, but that's okay. Let's roll the dice.

2258
01:45:35,840 --> 01:45:36,841
这是我的曲子
That's my jam!

2259
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:38,047
让他们看看你的能耐
Go show them what you got.

2260
01:45:38,240 --> 01:45:40,083
- 好的 达拉  - 好
- All right, Darla. - Okay.

2261
01:45:40,400 --> 01:45:42,402
达拉 嗨 我是加尔文
Darla, hi. Calvin.

2262
01:45:42,600 --> 01:45:44,250
嗨 科林 很高兴见到你
Hi, Colin. Nice to meet you.

2263
01:45:44,840 --> 01:45:46,763
- 是加尔文  - 我是麦吉
- Calvin. - And Maggie.

2264
01:45:46,920 --> 01:45:48,604
麦吉 嗨
Maggie, hi!

2265
01:45:48,760 --> 01:45:51,081
嗨 你真好看
Hi. You look so good.

2266
01:45:51,280 --> 01:45:53,601
- 天啊 你一点没变  - 你也是
- My gosh, you look the same. - You do too.

2267
01:45:53,760 --> 01:45:54,761
哪里有
Oh, I don't know.

2268
01:45:54,920 --> 01:45:57,048
你可能记得我的绰号黄金喷气机吧
You probably remember me as The Golden Jet.

2269
01:45:57,240 --> 01:45:59,846
你叫黄金杰夫?你好 杰夫
Your name's Golden Jeff? Hi, Jeff.

2270
01:46:00,600 --> 01:46:02,284
没关系 很高兴见到你
It's okay. Good to see you.

2271
01:46:05,680 --> 01:46:08,126
- 好样的 鲍勃  - 加油 鲍勃
- Good going, Bob! - Come on, Bob!

2272
01:46:23,840 --> 01:46:25,365
- 好  - 祝你好运
- All right. - Good luck!

2273
01:46:25,560 --> 01:46:26,800
- 我爱你  - 我爱你
- Love you. - I love you.

2274
01:46:26,960 --> 01:46:28,849
我也爱你 小黄金喷气机
I love you, too, little Golden Jet!

2275
01:46:31,520 --> 01:46:32,521
嗯...
Mmm...

2276
01:46:32,680 --> 01:46:33,761
好吧 呃
Okay. Uh...

2277
01:46:34,840 --> 01:46:36,410
你觉得他来了多久了
How long do you think he's been there?

2278
01:46:37,160 --> 01:46:38,969
大概从昨晚一直都在吧
Hmm, probably since last night.

2279
01:46:39,560 --> 01:46:40,971
好 老婆 我们回头见
All right, babe, I'll see you later.

2280
01:46:41,160 --> 01:46:42,889
跟你朋友好好玩
Have fun with your friend!

2281
01:46:48,480 --> 01:46:49,481
谁 我?
Who, me?

2282
01:46:49,640 --> 01:46:50,926
是的 你
Yes, you.

2283
01:47:00,120 --> 01:47:01,451
哇, 杰!
Wow, Jet!

2284
01:47:01,640 --> 01:47:03,324
你的样子真好
You look amazing!

2285
01:47:03,520 --> 01:47:05,284
- 真的吗  - 什么是的
- Do you think? - Oh, what? Yes!

2286
01:47:05,480 --> 01:47:08,521
我不知道去中情局上班 穿什么衣服合适.
I just didn't know the kind of look to go for on my first day at the agency.

2287
01:47:07,515 --> 01:47:08,641


2288
01:47:08,680 --> 01:47:10,728
你看起来就像黑人版的威尔·史密斯
You look like a black Will Smith, or something.

2289
01:47:10,920 --> 01:47:13,807
不知道这话有没有种族歧视, 但我就当是夸我的.
Okay, I'm not sure if that's racist or not, but I'll take it as a compliment.

2290
01:47:12,728 --> 01:47:13,896


2291
01:47:13,960 --> 01:47:15,371
好 好 走吧
All right, cool. Yeah, come on!

2292
01:47:15,520 --> 01:47:16,681
好
Okay.

2293
01:47:17,320 --> 01:47:18,526
好 不要紧张
All right. Don't be nervous.

2294
01:47:18,680 --> 01:47:20,444
你会做得很好 他们会很喜欢你
You are gonna do great. They're gonna love you!

2295
01:47:20,600 --> 01:47:22,011
哦, 杰, 杰, 杰!
Oh, Jet, Jet, Jet!

2296
01:47:22,200 --> 01:47:23,326
在我们去之前
Um, before we go, man, uh...

2297
01:47:24,760 --> 01:47:25,886
我要给你个礼物
I got a surprise for you.

2298
01:47:27,120 --> 01:47:29,043
好 什么礼物
Okay. What's the surprise?

2299
01:47:29,200 --> 01:47:31,851
你得先闭上眼睛
Well, you gotta close your eyes first.

2300
01:47:33,520 --> 01:47:34,681
闭上了
Eyes are closed.

2301
01:47:34,880 --> 01:47:35,881
不要偷看
No peeking.

2302
01:47:41,360 --> 01:47:42,521
睁开眼睛
Open your eyes.

2303
01:47:46,840 --> 01:47:49,207
这是…这是我的夹克吗
Is that my... Is that my jacket?

2304
01:47:49,360 --> 01:47:50,407
是的
Yes!

2305
01:47:50,560 --> 01:47:52,562
- 鲍勃 这是我的夹克吗 - 是的
- Bob, is that my jacket? - Yes!

2306
01:47:52,720 --> 01:47:54,165
- 不 等一下  - 是的
- No, wait a minute. - Yes!

2307
01:47:54,360 --> 01:47:56,044
天啊
Oh, my God!

2308
01:47:56,400 --> 01:47:57,526
你从哪儿找到的
Dude, where'd you get this from?

2309
01:47:57,680 --> 01:48:01,321
我晚上一般都穿着它睡觉 但现在洗干净了 完全没问题
Well, I sleep in it most nights, but it's clean now, totally good. Yeah!

2310
01:48:01,480 --> 01:48:04,086
天 你真厉害
Man! You are the man! Yes!

2311
01:48:04,240 --> 01:48:07,130
- 来个家庭拥抱  - 好吧
- Family hug! What? - Ooh. Okay.

2312
01:48:09,200 --> 01:48:10,326
好了 我们走
All right, let's go!

2313
01:48:10,480 --> 01:48:11,811

2314
01:48:15,811 --> 01:48:19,311
☆☆☆谢谢观赏☆☆☆
☆☆☆THE END☆☆☆

2315
01:48:26,200 --> 01:48:28,168
You still ride?

2316
01:48:28,680 --> 01:48:30,921
Cut! The fire department's here.

2317
01:48:31,200 --> 01:48:33,601
All right. That's our cue, guys!

2318
01:48:34,520 --> 01:48:36,249
Here we are shooting Central Intelligence.

2319
01:48:36,440 --> 01:48:38,363
They shut us down.
The fire trucks are out here.

2320
01:48:38,520 --> 01:48:40,204
- Shut the fuck up!
- Will you get the fuck out of my video?

2321
01:48:40,360 --> 01:48:41,361
I'mma slap the dogshit out of you.

2322
01:48:41,520 --> 01:48:42,521
Why do you do your video behind me?

2323
01:48:42,680 --> 01:48:43,886
- I'm trying to do my video!
- This is my video!

2324
01:48:44,040 --> 01:48:45,530
- You're in my fucking video!
- I'm pissed off.

2325
01:48:45,680 --> 01:48:47,170
Watch your mouth,
I'll slap the shit out of you.

2326
01:48:47,320 --> 01:48:48,321
Fuck you!

2327
01:48:49,280 --> 01:48:51,806
Okay. You have it your way.

2328
01:48:52,760 --> 01:48:54,762
You leave me no choice.

2329
01:48:56,040 --> 01:48:57,041
Pam...

2330
01:48:58,360 --> 01:48:59,361
Tickler! Tickler!

2331
01:48:59,520 --> 01:49:02,046
Where are the codes? Where are the codes?

2332
01:49:03,040 --> 01:49:04,530
It's just nice.

2333
01:49:06,200 --> 01:49:08,771
In here and it's kind of all...

2334
01:49:10,280 --> 01:49:11,691
- Oh, my God.
- Sorry.

2335
01:49:16,280 --> 01:49:17,645
- Can you do both?
- Yeah.

2336
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:19,126
Oh, my God!

2337
01:49:22,360 --> 01:49:24,169
It's called "soul gazing."

2338
01:49:24,320 --> 01:49:27,881
Stare into my soul
and I'll stare into yours.

2339
01:49:28,080 --> 01:49:29,525
- Come in. Shh.
- You're not my wife!

2340
01:49:29,680 --> 01:49:31,091
Oh, that's it.

2341
01:49:32,960 --> 01:49:34,371
- Bob, I'm gonna...
- Shh.

2342
01:49:35,480 --> 01:49:36,720
I promise you'll never...

2343
01:49:38,160 --> 01:49:39,844
Let's keep on, keep on.

2344
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:41,047
Okay, for real this time.

2345
01:49:42,160 --> 01:49:44,162
It's for real.
This is for real, guys, yeah.

2346
01:49:44,680 --> 01:49:45,806
- That's it!
- Oh.

2347
01:49:45,960 --> 01:49:47,485
One more. Come on.

2348
01:49:47,680 --> 01:49:48,806
- I can't do this, I'm not...
- Shh.

2349
01:49:48,960 --> 01:49:51,645
Oh, my God. I've fucking had it.

2350
01:49:51,800 --> 01:49:52,801
Lock it! We're professionals.

2351
01:49:52,960 --> 01:49:54,769
- This is what we do. You ready?
- Come on, baby!

2352
01:49:54,920 --> 01:49:56,649
I'm gonna hit you. I told you!

2353
01:49:56,800 --> 01:49:58,006
Fuck!

2354
01:49:59,960 --> 01:50:00,961
Are you not a super tool?

2355
01:50:01,120 --> 01:50:03,407
You're not even Robbie Wheirdicht.
You're Bob Stone!

2356
01:50:04,120 --> 01:50:05,645
- I made that name up.
- So what?

2357
01:50:05,800 --> 01:50:07,290
- It's not real.
- What does that mean?

2358
01:50:07,440 --> 01:50:11,331
What, you think Mr. T and Sting

2359
01:50:11,480 --> 01:50:12,720
and The Rock...

2360
01:50:12,880 --> 01:50:14,370
You think those guys are real?

2361
01:50:14,520 --> 01:50:17,524
That's a bunch of dumbass nicknames
by a bunch of dumbass people.

2362
01:56:02,720 --> 01:56:04,006
Fanny!
