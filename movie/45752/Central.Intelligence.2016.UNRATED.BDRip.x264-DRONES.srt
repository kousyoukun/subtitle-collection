it's time for a breakdown.</i>

00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,796
Mmm, mmm, mmm, yeah...

4
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,072
Man, I told you Robbie Wheirdicht
showers here during first period.

5
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:47,959
Why doesn't he just shower at home
like a normal person?

6
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:50,033
Look at him.

7
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,031
Does anything about that
look normal to you?

8
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:56,439
You know, he's actually
a pretty good dancer.

9
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:01,356
I mean, fuck that guy is different!

10
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,360
Let's wreck him.

26

31
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:21,675
<i>Huh?</i>

32
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,708
<i>Honestly, if my mom
was into white guys, it would be you.</i>

33
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:25,880
<i>I know it would, okay?</i>

34
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:31,512
<i>Well, as we all know,
this is our last assembly,</i>

35
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,752
<i>which means this is the last time

40

Okay.

<i>All right, guys. We're seniors now.</i>

43
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,870
<i>And once we get those diplomas,</i>

<i>But I can promise you all this...</i>

47
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,438

49
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:09,148
<i>So, I got one question to ask.</i>

50
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:12,756
<i>I got one question for

Hey. Here, here, man.

Thank you.

59

Yo. Check it.

60
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,416
Oh, come on, man.
I don't want to see that.

61
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,440
Oh, no, no, it's my dick.

62
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,320
I know what it is. I don't want to see it.

63
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,589
Hilarious.

64
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,360
No, I'm working on this new sexting app.

65
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,616
It's kind of like Instagram, right?

66
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:17,755
But, instead of filters,

67
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,280
it just makes your junk look huge.

68
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,317
Like, three to six inches bigger.

69
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,068
It's called "Junk Mail." Clever, right?

70
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:26,400
- No, and here's why...
- Sorry, hang on, one second.

71
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,039
I'm just gonna...

72
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:29,840
What are you doing?

73
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:36,513
Okay, and send.

74
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,600
Sorry, you were saying something boring.

75
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:39,988
You just sent a dick pic.

76
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,760
It's called dating, grandma. Look it up.

77
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,990
Why are you all cranky-pants
this morning, huh?

78
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,594
Oh. It's because Ethan got promoted
instead of you?

79
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:48,875
Ethan got promoted?

80
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,376
Youngest senior associate
in the history of the firm.

81
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,992
Corner office, the whole deal.

82
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,600
Didn't he used to be your assistant?

83
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,956
Who cares? Hey, you should
come to lunch with us.

84
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,696
We're gonna be celebrating his pro-mosh!

85
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,840
It'll probably be good for you
to kiss the ring a bit.

86
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,633
"Kiss the ring a bit"?

87
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,880
Hey, you play your chessboard
however you like, okay?

88
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:09,352
Me, lunch today?
I'm gonna French kiss that thing.

89
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,828
Aah...

90
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:14,278
I can't. I'm taking my wife
to lunch today, so...

91
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,714
All right. Bummer for you.

92
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,075
Right?

93
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,119
Can you just get out of my face?

94
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,793
#Blessed.

95
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:40,309
To a guy I not only consider my coworker,

96
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:41,873
but my personal friend.

97
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,037
- To Ethan!
- Cheers!

98
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,616
Do you wanna move tables?
I know this kind of sucks.

99
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:50,358
No, no. It doesn't suck.

100
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,976
Hey, if I wanted to get
one of those ice teas

101
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,136
but I want most of it to be bourbon...
What is that called?

102
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:57,869
Okay. How about we change the topic
to something a little more fun?

103
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,798
Anything else, please.

104
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,149
Oh, how about...

105
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:03,390
This is the dress
that I'm thinking about wearing.

106
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,200
Oh!

107
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,576
Honey, I want every single girl

108
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,113
to be jealous tomorrow night.

109
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,635
Oh.

110
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:10,960
What?

111
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,480
I just... I just don't want to go.

112
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:14,551
Calvin, it's our 20-year
high school reunion.

113
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:15,920
I'm not gonna go without you.

114
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,196
We agreed we were going. I RSVP'd for us.

115
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:20,999
I just changed my mind. That's all.

116
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,513
Okay. I see.

117
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:25,069
You're disappointed
about the promotion. I get it.

118
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:27,231
This is not about the promotion.

119
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,034
Okay, this has to do with me
not wanting to spend my Friday night

120
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,016
answering the
"What are you doing now?" question.

121
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:33,280
That's what I'll get all night.

122
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:35,216
"Hey, Calvin, what are you doing now?"
"I'm an accountant."

123
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,309
"An accountant? Really?

124
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,976
"I thought you would be the governor, man.

125
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,440
"Wait a minute. Didn't you get voted
'Most Likely to Succeed'?

126
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:41,913
"I guess we missed that one."

127
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,576
Is this why you've been
so weird and moody lately?

128
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,096
'Cause you're freaking out
about the reunion?

129
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,240
- No.
- And what's the matter

130
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,016
with being an accountant?
You love your job.

131
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,519
No, you love your job.

132
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,376
I'm good at my job.
It's not the same thing.

133
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,400
Honey, that's not fair.

134
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,198
You're a partner at your firm.

135
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,635
Instead, I work
in a building with a giant,

136
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,320
inflatable gorilla out in front of it.

137
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,336
Look, I don't want to be
the guy that peaked in high school

138
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,316
and, after he peaked,
his life went like this...

139
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,816
I don't know the sound
that that thing makes,

140
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:07,976
but you know what I'm trying to do.

141
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,320
I'm the guy that went down, okay?

142
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,395
- Yeah.
- Then my life

143
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:11,920
down here became a disappointment.

144
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,274
That's what I'll be.

145
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,440
Wow.

146
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:16,520
What?

147
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,056
I had no idea that your life with me

148
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,548
was such a soundless,
crashing disappointment!

149
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,358
Don't do that.

150
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,480
- That's not... Don't do that.
- That's the sound.

151
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,256
You want to know the sound
I'm about to make right now?

152
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,349
The sound of me not going.

153
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:28,919
That's the sound I'm making.

154
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,240
I'm not going.

155
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,240
Yeah.

156
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,878
<i>Mmm-mmm-mmm.</i>

157
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,040
No.

158
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:56,158
Not going to that.

159
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,269
Bob Stone?

160
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:16,789
Okay.

161
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,240
Hello?

162
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,795
- Hey.
- Girl, you scared me.

163
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:33,594
- I did?
<i>- Yes. I thought that you were...</i>

164
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:36,636
I just... On the...

165
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,959
<i>Never mind. Hey, I'm glad you called.</i>

166
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,390
I'm sorry about lunch today.

167
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,235
I'm an idiot, babe.

168
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,176
I don't even know
what's going on with me right now.

169
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,713
<i>- I really don't.</i>
- Yeah?

170
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,871
Actually, honey,

171
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,920
that's what I was calling
to talk to you about.

172
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:55,517
Look, honey, I think that
we should see someone.

173
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:59,552
What do you mean, "Someone"?
What do you mean?

174
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,830
See someone, like a therapist.

175
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:04,316
Honey, black people don't go to therapy.

176
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,559
We go to barbershops.

177
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,240
That's where we talk out our problems.

178
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,709
Or we watch the movie Barbershop.
One or the other.

179
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,438
Look, my parents were really unhappy

180
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,511
<i>for a long time before they got divorced.</i>

181
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:18,150
And maybe if they saw someone sooner,
they would still be married.

182
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:21,416
<i>I just want to nip this thing in the bud,
whatever it is.</i>

183
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,040
<i>I don't want to end up like my parents.</i>

184
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:27,118
<i>Wassup?</i>

185
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:35,835
<i>Please, just do it for me,
if not for you.</i>

186
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,109
<i>All right. Uh...</i>

187
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:41,918
- When? When do you want to do it?
<i>- Really?</i>

188
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:44,237
<i>The doctor said
he could see us at 6:00 p.m.</i>

189
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:47,275
Um... 6:00 p. m., when? Tonight?

190
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,271
Yeah. Yeah, is that a problem?

191
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:53,353
Holy shit! Robbie Wheirdicht?

192
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,879
Calvin, honey? Hello?

193
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,473
Um, yeah.

194
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:01,552
I can't. I already
made plans for tonight, baby.

195
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,950
- Plans with who?
- With Bob Stone.

196
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,151
Who's Bob Stone?
That sounds like a fake name.

197
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:09,630
No, no. You remember
Robbie Wheirdicht, from high school?

198
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:10,800
No.

199
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,016
The guy who got beaten up
by Trisha Demarco at homecoming?

200
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,075
No.

201
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,696
The kid that tried to rap along to
Coolio's <i>1,2,3,4</i> at the talent show

202
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,456
but then he kinda lost his way,
midway through

203
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,256
so he just started bopping his head,
and he stood there?

204
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,793
No. Nothing.

205
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,296
The guy who got thrown out the gym,
butt-ass-naked, senior year?

206
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,320
<i>Oh, my God, yeah!</i>

207
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:27,118
Why wouldn't you start with that?

208
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:29,216
Because I thought that was kind of mean.
I don't know.

209
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,736
He never came back
to school after that, right?

210
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:32,955
Like, not for finals
or graduation or anything.

211
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:34,991
<i>Didn't he join the military or something?</i>

212
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:37,071
I'm not sure.
I don't know if he did or not,

213
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:39,595
but he changed his name to "Bob Stone"

214
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,960
and apparently he's in town
for the high school reunion.

215
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,216
<i>He wants to go to dinner tonight,
and I kinda already said "yes."</i>

216
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,376
- Okay.
<i>- If you want me to cancel,</i>

217
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,833
I will. You know?

218
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,520
If that's what you want, I don't mind.

219
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:51,150
Mmm-mmm. I mean,
it's a little weird, but whatever.

220
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:53,675
I'll just see if the doctor
can fit us in tomorrow.

221
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,956
<i>- How about at lunch time?</i>
- Okay. All right, fine.

222
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,348
<i>Okay, good. I love you.</i>

223
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:59,238
I love you, too, babe. I do.

224
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:05,976
- Oh, my...
<i>- What is that?</i>

225
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,797
<i>- Okay.</i>
- Calvin? Are you...

226
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:08,960
Love you. Bye-bye.

227
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,080
No!

228
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,874
Stop, stop!

229
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,434
Hey, man. I...

230
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,676
Hey! What's up, guys?

231
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,794
Congratulations on that promotion, man.

232
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:22,960
It's quite the thing.

233
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,954
Thank you.
Hey, that's not work appropriate.

234
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,280
Yup.

235
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,032
Not cool, man. Not cool.

236
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,232
Hey, forward that to me.

237
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,000
<i>For real man, seriously?</i>

238
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,752
Yeah. Watch it, punk.

239
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,639
Excuse you, too.

240
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:13,400
My man!

241
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:14,959
Back the fuck up!

242
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:17,153
- Whoa!
- Back up, man!

243
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,317
Fine. I'll give you these fists.

244
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,715
I'll fist your ass.

245
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,439
Calvin. It's me, Bob.

246
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,431
What? Sorry, do I know you?

247
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,400
Do you know...

248
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:30,552
Robbie Wheirdicht from high school!

249
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,392
Are you kidding? What?

250
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:36,269
- Wait, you're Robbie Wheirdicht?
- Yeah!

251
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,713
God, man, look at you!
You've lost, like, 200 pounds!

252
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,472
I see you gained it back in muscle.

253
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:43,232
Oh, my God! You look great!

254
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:45,317
- No, you look great!
- Stop it.

255
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,835
No, you haven't changed
since high school, dude!

256
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:51,237
No, you're just sexy as dick right now.

257
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:53,436
You don't look somebody
in the eyes and say that.

258
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,635
Hey, let's get hammered.

259
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,036
I got an early day at work,
so I'll probably...

260
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,269
No, come on, I'm buying!

261
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,440
Oh, shit.

262
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Mmm.

263
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:04,028
I'm sorry, man. I am blown away right now.

264
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:06,391
Dude, you used to be Fat Robbie.

265
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,870
Look at you!
This is like a total transformation.

266
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,678
You look like Hercules or somebody.

267
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:12,336
What did you do? Come on, give it to me.

268
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:14,316
- I didn't do much, really.
- Stop it.

269
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,831
All right. I just did one thing.

270
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,195
Come on, I need to know.

271
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:20,835
I worked out six hours a day, every day,

272
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,479
for the last 20 years straight.

273
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:26,634
- I mean, anybody can do it, right?
- Yeah.

274
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:31,554
Yeah. You know, I've gotten into hot yoga.

275
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,639
I started doing some sessions.

276
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:35,800
Uh-huh.

277
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,468
Nice unicorn, man.

278
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:40,835
Oh, yeah,
I'm big-time into 'corns.

279
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,155
So magical, right?

280
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,515
You know, they're the most
lethal animal on the planet.

281
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:45,920
Here you go.

282
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:48,071
Guys, my name's Lexi.

283
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,656
Just let me know if you need anything.

284
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:50,829
Okay.

285
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:54,357
I mean, like, anything at all.

286
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,199
Okie-dokie.

287
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:59,559
You're funny. Do you ever, like, Snapchat?

288
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:02,359
- Oh, no. You know...
- I wasn't talking to you.

289
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,160
No, no, no. I don't do that.

290
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,714
I'm just catching up
with an old friend from high school.

291
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,556
Aw. You're so sweet.

292
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,399
I think unicorns are sexy, too.

293
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,600
That must happen to you
all the time, right?

294
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,069
Ah, nah.

295
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,397
I mean, all that meaningless sex is just...

296
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,198
It's not my bag anymore, CJ.

297
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:25,720
No, now, I'm looking for
more of an emotional connection.

298
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:26,989
The next woman I lay with,

299
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:28,912
she's gonna be beautiful on the inside,

300
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,752
just as much as she is on the outside.

301
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:32,760
Hey, wait. Whatever happened

302
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,336
to that girl that you liked
in high school?

303
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,920
Oh, God, man. The "Doogie Howser" girl.

304
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,911
She was 14, but somehow she was a senior.

305
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,195
She wore a cape.

306
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:43,150
- Darla McGuckian.
- Darla McGuckian.

307
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:45,072
"Yucky Gucky."

308
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,749
- Didn't she have a lazy eye or something?
- Two of 'em.

309
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,240
Right.

310
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,456
Hey, but listen,
I don't wanna talk about me.

311
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:51,480
I wanna talk about you.

312
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:53,056
I heard that
you and Maggie Johnson got hitched.

313
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,593
Oh, yeah.

314
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:56,558
Yeah, man, right after college.

315
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:00,110
Wow! The prettiest girl in school,
and the coolest guy in school!

316
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,280
Oh, man, I got lucky.

317
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,896
I mean, you guys are like
a power couple, dude!

318
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:04,433
- No, no.
- Yes!

319
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:07,433
You're like Taylor Swift
and whoever she's dating right now.

320
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:10,068
- Power.
- Uh, thanks!

321
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,713
Yeah. You guys got kids?

322
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,273
No. No kids yet.

323
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:15,351
We planned on it after college,

324
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:18,557
but Maggie went to law school,
I kept changing jobs.

325
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:22,116
You know, having kids just
isn't in our cards right now.

326
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:23,416
Not at this point, that's all.

327
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:24,475
- Oh, okay.
- Yeah.

328
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:28,116
I don't wanna talk about
me and Maggie and myself.

329
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,680
What about you? What are you doing?

330
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,880
I didn't even ask you, man.
What do you do for work?

331
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,473
I'm a government contractor.

332
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:36,319
Okay, that's cool.
Like, what, buildings and stuff?

333
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:38,240
Yeah, sort of.

334
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,314
But I kinda just got fired.

335
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,596
- Oh, shit! I'm sorry, man.
- Oh, it's okay.

336
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:45,433
Screw those guys, anyway.
They're way too corporate.

337
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:48,478
'Cause dudes like me and you,
I mean, we're alpha dogs, right?

338
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:50,511
I mean, we're pathfinders
and trailblazers.

339
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:53,353
And we don't listen
to what anyone tells us, right?

340
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,239
- Yeah, right.
- Yeah.

341
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:00,837
I mean, come on, man,
I sorta path-find a little bit

342
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:05,118
along certain preapproved parameters
that are given to me.

343
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:08,670
I'm willing to path-find
but it's all about how it's set up.

344
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:13,231
But within the box that I have, I go nuts.
You'll be surprised.

345
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,776
I had a guy tell me the other day,

346
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:17,633
"Hey, Calvin, you know,
I need those accounting numbers back

347
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,199
"from, you know, the file."

348
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:22,198
- I said, "Go fuck yourself, Jim."
- Yeah.

349
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:25,591
I didn't say it
because I wasn't in my box,

350
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:29,591
- but I thought about it.
- Exactly! Yeah! Yeah!

351
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,639
I got an idea. Let's do shots!

352
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:32,869
No!

353
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:34,792
I'm sorry for saying it like that, but no.

354
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,720
I haven't had shots
in almost 10 years, man.

355
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:39,035
What? Come on, we have to!
We're celebrating!

356
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:41,040
Celebrating what?

357
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,496
Celebrating that I'm hanging
with the coolest kid in high school.

358
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,351
- Stop it.
- Calvin Joyner!

359
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,717
The Golden Jet.

360
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,679
You got to be shitting me. Wow!

361
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,118
I haven't... God!

362
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,711
It's been forever since I heard that, man!

363
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:57,920
- I'll do one.
- All right!

364
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:59,040
- One shot.
- Shots!

365
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:00,309
No. One shot.

366
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,550
Just one, okay? Bob, it's been a while.

367
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:05,080
Oh, shit! You remember this?

368
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,713
This was the jammy-jam!

369
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,871
What's that? Is that a fanny pack, Bob?

370
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:10,559
Hell, yeah! Dude, you want one?

371
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,073
No, it's okay.

372
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,680
I got two at home. I'll hook you up.

373
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:16,030
Leather pack for The Jet.

374
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,235
Fanny!

375
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,674
Shit.

376
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:21,197
What the hell did I get myself into?

377
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,358
Mmm. Mmm-mmm-mmm.

378
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:26,399
Hey, sir, somebody's
actually sitting there.

379
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,750
- Yeah, someone was.
- No! Hey, man!

380
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:30,576
Hey, you don't see
the sweatshirt right here?

381
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:33,160
- Man, somebody's sitting here.
- Move your meat, lose your seat.

382
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,496
Dude, you don't
have to be a dick about it.

383
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:35,800
Somebody's sitting in the chair.

384
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:38,759
Bro, are you seriously
gonna go there, bro?

385
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,556
'Cause there's only one way back, bro.

386
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,836
Through intensive care, bro.

387
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,749
Was that the last "bro"?
'Cause if it was, then I'll talk.

388
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,194
That supposed to be funny?

389
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,759
- Dude...
- You a comedian now?

390
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:53,076
'Cause you don't look like
Dane Cook to me, bro.

391
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:54,719
Hey, now!

392
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:56,589
What's the rumpus?

393
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:57,976
<i>You know...
There's no problem, man.</i>

394
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,281
<i>Let's just go to another table.
Get your jacket. Let's go.</i>

395
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,816
- No, we're not gonna go anywhere.
- Listen to your pussy friend.

396
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:05,229
Those gym muscles
aren't scaring anybody, pal.

397
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,436
- Oh, these?
- Let's just go. It's okay.

398
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:10,108
No, we're not gonna go.
This man insulted you.

399
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:12,080
And we're not gonna leave
until he apologizes.

400
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,276
- It's okay.
- Hey, we got a problem here?

401
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,471
- No, no.
- Yeah, we got a big problem.

402
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:19,313
Your friend, here,
really insulted my friend

403
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:20,520
and he needs to apologize.

404
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:21,640
I don't think he does.

405
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:22,800
<i>He doesn't.</i>

406
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,837
<i>Oh, you know what, man?</i>

407
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,416
<i>I think this whole situation's
getting a little out of control.</i>

408
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:28,589
<i>I can fix this whole thing.</i>

409
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:31,115
I'll order some nachos. The "Explosions."

410
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:33,635
It's got four cheeses!
Let's eat 'em together.

411
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:34,960
<i>You know what? You take them.</i>

412
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,040
Let's go.

413
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,456
Nah. We're not going anywhere, Jet.

414
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:39,080
This whole thing will be over in a jiff.

415
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,633
Hey, how about this?

416
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:43,308
Why don't you and your boyfriend
apologize to Big Rick here

417
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:45,675
and then go jerk each other
in the parking lot?

418
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,160
That's a lot...

419
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,315
Yeah. You're right, CJ.

420
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,119
That's a lot of homophobia
coming out of a very angry man.

421
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,800
<i>You need to go get that looked at
by a trained professional.</i>

422
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:56,155
But, since you have
escalated this whole scenario

423
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:57,799
by bringing what I can only assume

424
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:00,349
<i>is an unlicensed firearm
into this public place,</i>

425
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:02,670
endangering the lives
of all these innocent people,

426
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:05,638
I can no longer,
in good conscience, walk away

427
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,518
and jerk anyone off in the parking lot.

428
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:09,796
I'm afraid we ain't going anywhere.

429
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,336
It's time for you to get out of here, pal.

430
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:12,793
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

431
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,431
There's four of us, tough guy.

432
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,599
Yeah. I got that.

433
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,856
All right. Before
this whole thing goes down,

434
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:21,096
you should know one thing about me.

435
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,120
What's that?

436
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:27,519
I don't like bullies.

437
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,029
Let's go, Jet.

438
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,348
Yes.

439
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:46,354
Oh, my God! I hope he's Catholic.

440
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:50,873
Oh, my God!

441
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:52,513
What the hell was that?

442
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:54,696
Bob, that was amazing!
I've never seen anything like that!

443
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,440
You took the one guy,
you hit him like this.

444
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:57,896
He couldn't breathe.

445
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,319
I sat there, I'm looking at him...

446
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:00,896
You talkin' to him like,
"I don't like bullies."

447
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,616
I was like, "That's not a good line."
But it was!

448
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:03,816
I didn't even know you could fight!

449
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:06,559
You had a unicorn shirt, a fanny pack,
and it totally worked!

450
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:08,910
You were like Jason Bourne,
man, but with jorts!

451
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:11,389
How did you do that?
Where'd you learn that stuff?

452
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,397
I took a couple classes at work.

453
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:14,919
I hope I didn't go too far.

454
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:16,336
I'm sorry about ruining the night, Jet.

455
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:19,238
Ruin my night?
No! It was the coolest thing ever, man!

456
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,839
- Really?
- Yes!

457
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,400
To see my boy go in and whoop ass
on those idiots back there.

458
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:24,629
Dude, that was amazing!

459
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,711
Wait, we're boys?

460
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:28,429
Yeah, we boys.

461
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,115
Wow. I...

462
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Never had a boy.

463
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:38,835
- That's awesome! Come here!
- Oh, wait.

464
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,512
Stop. What's going on, man?

465
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:43,272
- I'm a hugger!
- What're you doing?

466
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:47,717
Hey! I got an idea.
Let's roll. Here's my bike.

467
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,029
Wait. That's your bike?

468
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,918
Yeah. Kawasaki 800!

469
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,513
I know what the bike is.

470
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:55,392
I had the same bike in high school, man.

471
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,192
- You still ride?
<i>- No, man.</i>

472
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:58,536
I haven't ridden a bike in years!

473
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,788
Come on, let's roll.

474
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,473
Where? Where you trying to go?

475
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:07,439
I know the perfect spot. Come on, Jet.

476
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,959
You know, why not? Why not?

477
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:12,315
After this... Yeah, okay!

478
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:13,789
Let's roll.

479
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:18,991
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Hey, Bob! Slow, slow, slow!

480
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:20,629
Bob, hey, hey!

481
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:29,837
<i>God, this is so crazy, man.</i>

482
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,718
<i>This brings back so many memories.</i>

483
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:34,109
I don't know, CJ.

484
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:35,976
I mean, high school
wasn't easy for me, man.

485
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,136
I don't know if you know this,

486
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,800
but I didn't have many friends back then.

487
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:40,480
What?

488
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:42,678
- Really?
- No.

489
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:44,000
I don't know why I thought...

490
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:45,359
True story.

491
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:48,353
Man, I thought high school
was gonna be like <i>Sixteen Candles</i>

492
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:50,317
and I was gonna be like Molly Ringwald.

493
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,616
<i>Sure, things were difficult
in the beginning,</i>

494
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:52,959
<i>but then, by the end,</i>

495
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,354
everything worked out.

496
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:56,590
And Jake Ryan picked her up
in that red Porsche.

497
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:57,829
What-what?

498
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:59,040
You ever see that movie?

499
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:02,356
I'm black, so I don't know the...

500
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:04,192
<i>You gotta see it, dude.</i>

501
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:07,352
Total classic.
It's my favorite all-time movie.

502
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:10,637
Then I realized high school
was nothing like Sixteen Candles.

503
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:13,711
And I'll never be like Molly Ringwald.

504
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,472
<i>Yeah, well, depends on who you ask.</i>

505
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:19,193
That's the thing. For me, I...

506
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:21,869
<i>What's going on?</i>

507
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:24,308
Oh, wow.

508
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:27,936
Hey, man, I just wanna say that
I'm really sorry

509
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:30,394
about what Trevor and those guys
did to you back then.

510
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:40,038
No biggie. I don't even
think about it anymore. No.

511
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:41,829
Okay, good.

512
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,856
Yeah. Here's the secret.
You know what I did, Jet?

513
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:46,314
I took all that stuff
and I balled it up real tight

514
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,994
and then I shoved it way down deep.

515
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,511
And I just pretty much ignore it.

516
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:54,713
You know, that sounds
really unhealthy, Bob.

517
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,228
Hey, I gotta tell you.

518
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,296
You were the only one
who helped me out that day.

519
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:59,878
In the gym? Remember that?

520
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:02,395
And you gave me your letterman's jacket!

521
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:05,637
Hey, not for nothing,
but I never got that jacket back, man.

522
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,080
Huh!

523
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:09,038
Really? Strange.

524
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,456
Hey, but listen, I just wanna thank you

525
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:12,696
for what you did for me that day.

526
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,040
That was really cool of you, Jet.

527
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:16,120
Stop, man.
It was the right thing to do, you know?

528
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:20,155
- You wanna hear something weird?
- What?

529
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:22,038
I have not been naked since that day.

530
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:23,519
I mean, not in front of anyone.

531
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:24,989
Never.

532
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:26,896
<i>So, you're telling me
that for the last 20 years,</i>

533
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:28,751
<i>you've never been seen
in your birthday suit?</i>

534
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,678
- No.
- So, what about when you have sex?

535
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:33,230
I keep it pitch-black,
just like Vin Diesel.

536
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:34,800
What?

537
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,800
You know I've been wondering,
whatever happened to Trevor anyway?

538
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:41,679
Did he get hit by a bus
or ripped apart by dogs

539
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,876
or die slowly of anything?

540
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:47,868
No. No, no.
He's a bigtime investment banker downtown.

541
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,675
- Oh, hey, cool.
- Yeah.

542
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:52,159
Good for him, man.

543
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:55,074
Hey, Bob, look,
if you ever wanna talk, I'm here.

544
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:57,198
So I don't mind, you know?

545
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:58,896
I don't mind at all, if you wanna...

546
00:25:58,920 --> 00:25:59,920
What?

547
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:03,072
Whoa.

548
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:06,155
This is all our stuff from our year!

549
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:09,153
Yeah. Must be getting ready
for the reunion tomorrow night.

550
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:10,496
Come on, man. Let's get out of here.

551
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:12,715
What? No! "Get out..."
Look, you're all over this!

552
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:16,230
Look at this.
Basketball, baseball, cross country.

553
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,628
<i>Hamlet.</i>

554
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:18,840
Prom King.

555
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,558
There's Darla McGuckian.

556
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:22,637
<i>Synchronized swimming, that's so sexy.</i>

557
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:25,480
This is like the <i>Guinness Book
of Golden Jet Records</i> right there.

558
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:27,948
I see that.

559
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:31,720
To be honest with you,
I don't even recognize this guy anymore.

560
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:33,838
<i>This guy, here, he was gonna...</i>

561
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,877
<i>He was gonna conquer the world.</i>

562
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,032
If 18-year-old me could see me now,

563
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:40,912
he'd probably think I was a total loser.

564
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:44,111
What? That's crazy talk!

565
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:45,793
- You're The Golden Jet, dude!
- Stop.

566
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:48,793
Stop, Bob. Spare me
with The Golden Jet shit.

567
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,670
I'm not The Golden Jet, man.
I'm an accountant.

568
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:53,233
That's my reality.

569
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:59,192
I just thought
I was meant for more, you know?

570
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:01,871
<i>My life would be something special.</i>

571
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:06,439
You know how they say every man
is the hero of his own story?

572
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:08,709
Was that in <i>Twilight?</i>

573
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:12,033
No, I don't think that's where it's from.

574
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:14,236
But those books are cool, right? Vampires!

575
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:16,431
And there's a wolf-boy.

576
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:21,390
I'm not... I'm not talking
about Twilight, Bob, okay?

577
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:22,856
I'm talking about the fact that
I don't feel like

578
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,632
I'm the hero of my own story. That's...

579
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,480
How are you not the hero
of your own story?

580
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:28,033
No one else can be!

581
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,952
Yo, CJ, I gotta be honest with you, man.

582
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:31,760
I mean, all this talk about Calvin Joyner

583
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:33,040
not feeling like he's a hero...

584
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,713
That's crazy talk, man.

585
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:36,832
No. No, it's not.

586
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,680
You were the best thing about high school.

587
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:40,399
I'll always believe in you.

588
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:42,869
Yo, do you remember
those backflips you used to do?

589
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:45,360
The crowd would go crazy!
I was there, too.

590
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:47,431
I was, like, "What? How's he do that?"

591
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:48,675
How did you do that?

592
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:52,232
I don't know. I just did it, man.

593
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:53,909
Exactly.

594
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:55,080
So, do it now.

595
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:58,872
No, no. You're crazy! No.

596
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,269
What's that?

597
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:01,616
What're you talking about? What's what?

598
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:03,232
- Golden Jet!
- No, stop it.

599
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:05,152
- Golden Jet!
- Okay, stop it!

600
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:06,833
- Golden Jet!
- All right.

601
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,319
Golden Jet!

602
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:11,358
I'm not gonna stop until
you do The Golden Jet flip!

603
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:12,520
Golden Jet!

604
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:14,910
All right, everybody, settle down.
Settle down!

605
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:17,594
If the crowd wants a Golden Jet flip,

606
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,478
then they gonna get a Golden Jet flip.

607
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:20,755
You go, girl!

608
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:26,677
Oh, God!

609
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:28,193
That was so close, Jet.

610
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:30,800
Here, buddy. Come on.

611
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,560
They must have just waxed these floors.

612
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,592
That was definitely a first, man.

613
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,473
Oh, man, I am beat.

614
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:42,040
Oh.

615
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:45,075
Hey, Jet!

616
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:48,670
Man, I had a great time tonight.

617
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:49,840
Whoa!

618
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,471
You know what?
I had a good time, too, man.

619
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,080
I feel like I needed this, you know?

620
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,435
Yeah. Yeah. Me, too!

621
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:57,960
Thank you.

622
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:00,549
My pleasure, amigo. Any time.

623
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:04,110
Hey, if there's ever anything
I can do for you, just say the word.

624
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:06,794
Wow. You really mean that?

625
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:08,355
Yeah.

626
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:11,318
I wasn't gonna bring it up,
but I might as well.

627
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:14,637
Lately, I've been having this problem
with my payroll account. And...

628
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:16,520
It's all screwed up, somehow.

629
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:20,071
You know, I was overseas
working for a while before I got fired.

630
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:23,152
So, it's kinda like
a forensic international account thingy

631
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:26,557
which, I think,
is kind of your specialty, right?

632
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:28,600
Um...

633
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,788
Yeah, no, it is.
I'll take a look at that for you.

634
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,296
<i>You would? You would do that for me?</i>

635
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:36,834
I've got the login info,
if you wanna crack open your computer,

636
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:38,268
we can do this!

637
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,278
Oh, you mean now?

638
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:42,556
- That's awesome! Yeah!
- Okay.

639
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,392
- Look at this!
- Hey, Bob...

640
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:45,595
Whoa!

641
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:47,136
Bob, you gotta keep your voice down!

642
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,275
Maggie's sleeping.

643
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,440
Wow.

644
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:54,311
This is a pretty serious international
account dossier you've got here.

645
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:57,637
Right? I just want to make sure
everything was hunky-dory.

646
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,797
Going to your router.

647
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:06,394
Now you're talking to me.

648
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:09,950
Bingo. I'm in.

649
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:12,755
Oh. That's great, Jet.
Thank you, man!

650
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,471
I mean, just looking at it first-hand,

651
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:21,950
<i>it kinda looks like it's a bunch of
off-shore escrow accounts.</i>

652
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:23,633
These have been backwashed into

653
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:26,877
a series of domestic dummy accounts
for some reason.

654
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:29,600
I mean, the logs are all crazy, too.
You have China,

655
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,833
<i>Syria, Iran.</i>

656
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:34,673
<i>This is an auction site, Bob!</i>

657
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,592
These are bids. All of these.

658
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:40,320
This is hundreds of millions
of dollars in bids, right here.

659
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:41,919
And judging by this clock, here,

660
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:43,520
<i>it says it's all gonna end tomorrow.</i>

661
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:44,755
<i>Whoa!</i>

662
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:47,957
- What the hell? Why?
- What did...

663
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:49,553
- Oh! I'm sorry, Jet!
- Bob!

664
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:52,393
Jet, I'm so sorry! Oh, man.

665
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:54,835
- I'm all thumbs.
- It's my computer!

666
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:56,553
- I'm sorry.
- No! Please, Bob.

667
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,096
- I'm sorry, Jet.
- Leave it. I got it.

668
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:00,475
It's fine, Bob. It's fine. Just leave it.

669
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:01,789
The worst!

670
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:03,229
God!

671
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:06,029
Hey! What the hell was that on that site?

672
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,960
That didn't have
anything to do with payroll.

673
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:10,271
I don't know. I've never seen that before.

674
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:11,440
<i>That was crazy.</i>

675
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:14,016
Let's figure it out tomorrow
when we're bright-eyed and bushy-tailed.

676
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:16,349
What do you say, CJ? I am beat.

677
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:18,513
Hey, do you mind if I crash here?

678
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:20,634
Um...

679
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:22,720
No.

680
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:26,117
Let me go grab some blankets.

681
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:33,229
Hey, thanks for the jammies, Jet.

682
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:37,159
Okay, well, you can keep those.

683
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:39,117
Those are... Those are officially yours.

684
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:41,959
Yeah.

685
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,597
- All right.
- Oh.

686
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:46,920
You gonna sleep with your fanny pack.

687
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:49,992
Golden Jet! Yeah, it's my baby.

688
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:04,797
You need anything else? You're okay?

689
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:10,150
I can't believe I'm having a sleepover
at Calvin Joyner's house right now.

690
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:12,828
This is blowing my mind!

691
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:15,320
Okay.

692
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:16,880
Uh, good night, Bob.

693
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:19,029
Good night, Jet.

694
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:39,800
<i>Me?</i>

695
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:41,714
<i>Yeah, you.</i>

696
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:48,879
What the fuck?

697
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:52,988
One second.

698
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:58,914
Hold on.

699
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,435
Uh, may I help you?

700
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:06,113
Mr. Joyner, my name is Pamela Harris,

701
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:08,555
I'm with the Central Intelligence Agency.

702
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:11,075
Have you had any contact with this man?

703
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:14,319
Uh, yeah, he's on my...
He's on my couch, sleeping.

704
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:15,480
Target's in the house.

705
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:17,875
What's going on? Hey!

706
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:20,474
Excuse me. Excuse me!

707
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,720
Target's fled.

708
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:26,989
Shit.

709
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:28,355
Target's on the move.

710
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:29,589
Excuse me! What...

711
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:35,597
Hello, hey! Excuse me!

712
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:37,976
- ...and voice chatter in the vicinity.
<i>- Hello! Excuse me!</i>

713
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,281
If he's in the wind again,
it's gonna be your ass. Go now.

714
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:42,550
- Hello!
- Alert Langley, asset uncontained.

715
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:43,914
Excuse me!

716
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:45,960
- Can I help you?
- Hello!

717
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:47,456
It's my house. Is something going on?

718
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:49,914
Well, Mr. Joyner,
your sleepover buddy, Robert Wheirdicht,

719
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:53,550
AKA Bob Stone, AKA Bob Golden,
AKA Bob Jet,

720
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:55,717
is wanted for murder and treason

721
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:58,519
and is presently in possession
of highly classified state secrets

722
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:00,392
which he intends to sell to our enemies.

723
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:01,635
What?

724
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:05,588
And if he succeeds, it's gonna spark
a chain reaction of geopolitical events

725
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:07,056
that most of our predictive models

726
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:09,833
place somewhere between
World War III and outright Armageddon.

727
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,309
So, yeah, I guess you could say
something is going on.

728
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:13,720
Oh, you mind?

729
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:18,000
Creamer's in the fridge. What?

730
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:19,679
I don't need it.

731
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:21,717
What I do need is information.

732
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:24,713
I need you to tell me
everything and anything

733
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:26,632
about your contact with Agent Stone.

734
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:30,114
- Agent Stone?
- Bob, your friend Bob.

735
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:32,077
Come on. Stay with me, please.

736
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:35,310
Okay, I think there's a misunderstanding.

737
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:37,630
No. No, he is not my friend.

738
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:39,576
Then why did he list you
as his emergency contact

739
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:40,749
in all his personnel forms?

740
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:42,109
I'm sorry... He what?

741
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:44,794
Bob Stone has no siblings, or parents,
or family of any kind.

742
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:46,235
You are the only person

743
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:48,595
he listed in his personal references.

744
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,028
Oh...

745
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:52,634
That's crazy, all right?
I barely even know the guy.

746
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,216
Then why was he sleeping on your couch?

747
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:55,576
Because we went out
and had drinks last night.

748
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:57,560
Oh, so you went out drinking
with your non-friend?

749
00:34:58,440 --> 00:34:59,440
Okay.

750
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:01,439
All right, let's... You're not...

751
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:02,955
Time out.

752
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:04,559
I'm pressing the time out button.

753
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:08,156
Okay? You guys barged in my house.
I pay my taxes.

754
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:11,591
So you're not gonna come here
and treat me like I'm the enemy, okay?

755
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:14,136
That's the first thing.
Now, if you want to get into facts...

756
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:15,639
You wanna talk about facts?

757
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:16,840
This is Facebook's fault.

758
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,136
Are you familiar with Facebook?

759
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:19,195
We surveil it.

760
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:20,918
He sent me a friend request.

761
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:22,520
That's how this whole thing started.

762
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:23,789
And you accepted?

763
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:26,238
Don't do that. Don't do that to me.

764
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:29,756
You give me a second. Okay?
Don't fire back like that.

765
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:32,036
First of all,
fuck Mark Zuckerberg, all right?

766
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:34,555
Now, I accepted because it was Facebook.

767
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:36,056
And it's rude when you don't accept it

768
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:37,376
and I don't know
if the person on the other end

769
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:39,709
can see me not accept it.
That's why I accepted.

770
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,359
Are you nervous, Mr. Joyner?

771
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:42,715
Is it hot?

772
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,757
Are you getting hot?
Because I'm getting hot.

773
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:46,239
I'm not gonna take off my jacket

774
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,038
because that makes me look guilty.

775
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:50,589
And that's what you guys look for. Hmm?

776
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,355
Is this what a guilty man would do?

777
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:55,909
Look how comfortable I am.

778
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:59,080
I'm gonna lean up against this counter,
and I'm not gonna sweat.

779
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:03,554
I'm not gonna...
I'm not gonna look flustered at all.

780
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:05,591
I'm... Bring it.

781
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:07,234
What you want to know?

782
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:08,595
Hmm?

783
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:09,909
- Mr. Joyner.
- Yeah.

784
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:11,911
Bob Stone is a dangerous psychotic.

785
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:14,231
- You're lucky to be alive.
- Okay, listen to me.

786
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:17,238
Agent Harris, I don't know this man.

787
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:19,256
He's just a little weird kid
that I knew in high school.

788
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:20,936
He used to put Rice Krispies Treats
in my locker.

789
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:22,416
Sometimes I ate 'em, sometimes I didn't.

790
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:23,839
I wasn't in carbs back then

791
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:26,160
'cause I didn't want that weight
going to my hips.

792
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:28,600
As a man, you don't want big hips,
especially in high school.

793
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:31,069
Bottom line,
I have no allegiance to this man.

794
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:32,798
Zero ties, okay?

795
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,149
All ties are cut.

796
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:36,276
I cut them, so this is me and you.

797
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:38,432
So don't put me and him...

798
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:40,990
I ain't in this shit, okay?

799
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:44,075
All right, Mr. Joyner. Prove it.

800
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,552
Yeah, well, I need a second.

801
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:49,228
You gotta step outside.
I gotta take a shit.

802
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:50,594
This is a lot.

803
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:53,069
I got to go. Just give me a second, man!

804
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:55,836
- I'll be waiting.
- Jesus Christ!

805
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:08,953
All teams be advised,
we're Oscar Mike with the bait.

806
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:10,736
I'm sorry, did you just
call me "the bait"?

807
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:11,795
No.

808
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,176
Yeah, you did.
She just called me the bait.

809
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:14,200
Why am I the bait?

810
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:16,016
No, that doesn't sound like
something I'd ever say.

811
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:18,190
- You just said it.
- What's going on here?

812
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:19,998
Sir, I'm gonna need you to step aside.

813
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:22,310
This is a matter of national security.

814
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:23,828
Yeah, right! I love it.

815
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,360
What is this? Like a strippergram thing
to suck up to Ethan?

816
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:27,999
Gotta love strippers. So dirty.

817
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:30,116
Show us your tits! Show us your tits!

818
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:32,999
Hey, let's see some titty!

819
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:38,156
- This you?
- Yeah, right here.

820
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:39,833
You did this to yourself.

821
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:47,509
- Small.
- Yeah.

822
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:55,680
It's my wife.

823
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:59,199
Mr. Joyner, it is my legal obligation
to inform you

824
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:02,079
that you are now a part of
a highly classified covert action.

825
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:04,470
So, say hello to your wife
and then get off the phone.

826
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:05,834
<i>Am I clear?</i>

827
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,513
Don't tell my wife shit. Got it.

828
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:09,475
Don't tell your wife shit.

829
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:12,472
- What line?
- Line one.

830
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:16,760
Hey, Mags.
Hey, I can't really talk right now, babe.

831
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:19,673
- I got a lot going on.
- Okay, okay. I get it. You're hungover.

832
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:21,751
Listen, Dr. Dan can see us today at lunch.

833
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,514
- Wait a minute, Dr. Dan?
<i>- The therapist, remember?</i>

834
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:27,956
So, I'm thinking we should just
meet at home and go together. Thank you.

835
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:31,317
Go. Go on,
and I'll just see you there, okay?

836
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:32,640
But I got to really go, babe.

837
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:34,496
I'm slammed in here.
So, I gotta get off the phone.

838
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:37,120
- All right. Jeez! Is everything okay?
<i>- Everything is fine, babe.</i>

839
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:39,629
I gotta keep the line clear.
I love you. Bye, I gotta go.

840
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,149
Love you. Bye.

841
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:43,720
Hmm.

842
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:45,475
"Hmm." What?

843
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:48,438
I'm an expert in speech pathology
and psycho-lingual subtext.

844
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:50,750
Your wife is not fulfilled
in your relationship.

845
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,000
Wait, what?

846
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:53,759
Also, she wants to have a baby.

847
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:55,514
Where are you getting...

848
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:00,713
Calvin Joyner, Accounting.

849
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:05,550
Hello? Calvin Joyner, Accounting.

850
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:07,320
<i>Calvin?</i>

851
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:12,750
It's Bob! It's Bob!

852
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:14,148
Act natural.

853
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:16,436
<i>Calvin. Is that you?</i>

854
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:17,749
<i>Are you there?</i>

855
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:20,675
Well, hey. Well, yeah.

856
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:23,431
Yeah, wassup?

857
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:26,840
What up, Bobby-o?

858
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,195
Are you quite well?

859
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:30,429
<i>I'm in big trouble.</i>

860
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:32,875
<i>Oh, God! I screwed up.
I screwed up big time.</i>

861
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:35,156
<i>We gotta talk. Can you meet me?</i>

862
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:37,515
Sure. Yeah. Where?
Where do you want me to meet you?

863
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:39,880
<i>I'm in the stairwell of your building,
two flights down.</i>

864
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:41,274
- Stairwell?
<i>- Hurry!</i>

865
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:44,896
- He's in the stairwell, two flights down!
- Move, move!

866
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:45,989
Alert Charlie team.

867
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:48,151
Hold on. What's going on? Am I safe here?

868
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:50,256
As long as Bob Stone
is in the building, no one's safe.

869
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:52,157
Get back in your office now!

870
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:57,954
Okay!

871
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:00,196
Good news is we heard her, guys.

872
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:03,358
So, everybody, let's all just stay calm.

873
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:05,954
As long as... As long... Shit!

874
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,956
What the hell is going on?

875
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:12,269
- Relax.
- Hey.

876
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:14,120
Great job at
getting them out of here, Jet.

877
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:15,429
- Oh, Bob!
- That's teamwork!

878
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:17,480
Wait! How did you... What did you just do?

879
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:18,754
It's a tradecraft, buddy.

880
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,274
Spoiler alert...

881
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:21,595
I'm in the CIA.

882
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:22,829
Oh, no shit!

883
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,416
Hey, hey! What're you doing with my phone?

884
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:26,440
You about to turn my phone
into a bomb, aren't you?

885
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:28,516
I've seen <i>Homeland.</i>
So I know what they do.

886
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:31,314
Homeland?
No, I'm ordering us an Uber.

887
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:33,311
Six minutes. That's kinda tight.

888
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:35,792
I'm gonna need your tie.

889
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:37,515
You're gonna... No!

890
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:39,000
- Your necktie, take it off.
- No,

891
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:40,736
- I'm not taking my tie off!
- Come on, Jet!

892
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:42,400
Don't do that. Don't do that.

893
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:43,696
That's good. Save it, save it, save it.

894
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:45,073
Save it, Jet.

895
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:47,216
- There we go, just right over here.
- Fine, take it, take it.

896
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:49,993
You can have it. Okay, that...
Listen to me. Listen.

897
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:51,195
Stop. Stop!

898
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:53,351
I need to know
what is happening, right now.

899
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:55,511
Okay, okay. You know what?
Moving too fast.

900
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:58,871
Bottom line, are you in or you out?

901
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:01,016
What are you... In or out of what?

902
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:03,508
Mmm-mmm. No time
for questions, just action.

903
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:05,750
- In or out?
- Okay, then I'm out.

904
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,391
I'm sorry, Jet.
Actually, you're already in.

905
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:09,993
Then why would you ask me?

906
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:11,960
Because I thought
you would go, "I'm in, Bob!"

907
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:13,536
And we would've had a really cool moment,

908
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:15,040
but you kinda ruined the whole thing.

909
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:16,155
I ruined...

910
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:17,389
<i>Okay, okay, okay.</i>

911
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:18,959
Listen to me right now.

912
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:20,856
<i>Bob, I don't know what it is
that you're into</i>

913
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:22,313
<i>but what I do know is that</i>

914
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:26,359
I am really, really 100% out!

915
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:27,520
Do you understand that?

916
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:29,955
- God, you are good!
- What?

917
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:32,918
Calvin Joyner, president of the Drama Club
for a reason, folks!

918
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:35,800
- You're like a snack-size Denzel.
- Okay. Stop it, stop it, stop it.

919
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,199
This is not a game.

920
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:39,873
I'm being serious right now.

921
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:41,560
I'm out!

922
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:45,314
Okay. Okay.

923
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:47,590
I can't say I'm not disappointed, Jet,

924
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:49,714
but if you're out, you're out.

925
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:51,757
Thank you! I'm out!

926
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:53,876
I'm just happy that we can communicate

927
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:55,678
openly and honestly.

928
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:58,798
I think it says a lot
about our relationship.

929
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:01,315
Wait, hold up, wait.
What're you doing? Oh, my God!

930
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:02,515
Here's the thing, though.

931
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:04,280
There's only one way for you to get out.

932
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:05,475
What's that?

933
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:06,834
You gotta get in first.

934
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:08,359
What is it that...

935
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:09,794
What-what! Take my gun, Jet,

936
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,513
we may have to kill some people.

937
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:13,976
- Come on, it's not gonna bite you.
- I will do no such thing.

938
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,000
I think you'll like it.

939
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:16,600
- I will not!
- You're gonna need it.

940
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:19,908
You're gonna need it! He's in here!

941
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:21,120
Jet.

942
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:23,840
He's in there! Bob's in there!

943
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,275
He's got a gun! He's got a gun!

944
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:30,160
- Down, down, get down!
- Move, move, move!

945
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:32,136
All right. I'm gonna need
your improv skills.

946
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:33,160
What?

947
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:35,794
- Hostage role-play, you ready?
- No!

948
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:37,598
- Sweet, let's go.
<i>- No, I said no!</i>

949
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:38,909
I said no!

950
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:40,513
He's got a hostage!

951
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:42,560
No!

952
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:44,551
No! Stop it, you gonna get me killed!

953
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:47,309
Don't shoot!

954
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:00,960
There we go, Jet!

955
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:02,840
What are you doing?

956
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:03,989
Oh! Shoot!

957
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:06,840
Don't shoot!

958
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:20,990
- Hang tight, Jet!
- No, I'm not doing anything!

959
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:22,679
Stop including me in your stuff!

960
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:26,238
Get him, Agent! Hit him with the stick!

961
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:32,275
Oh!

962
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:34,736
You're doing a great job, Jet.
Just give me a second, okay?

963
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:35,795
What the fuck?

964
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:37,840
He got a coffee pot!

965
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:56,560
He got a banana!

966
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:03,033
Oh! Oh!

967
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:05,234
Freeze!

968
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:18,278
Jet, help!

969
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:19,480
What?

970
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:22,675
Golden Jet, help.

971
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:24,000
No, man, I'm not helping you!

972
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,000
Oh, shit.

973
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:29,834
- Give me the gun!
- Stop it!

974
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,320
- Stop resisting!
- No, let me go!

975
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:37,071
Let me go! I'm trying to give it to you!

976
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:41,394
Oh, shit!

977
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:42,896
- That was an accident!
- Don't move!

978
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:44,194
No, stop! Listen to me!

979
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:47,909
Let's go.

980
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:50,280
Wait, wait! Come on! What are you... Ah!

981
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:52,028
Come on, man!

982
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:54,156
This has gotta stop! Okay?

983
00:44:56,080 --> 00:44:57,115
<i>Shit!</i>

984
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:02,874
Don't shoot!

985
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:05,791
- Oh, God!
- Show us your hands!

986
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:07,393
- Drop your weapon!
- Do it now!

987
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:17,080
Ow.

988
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:18,880
Sorry, Jet.

989
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:21,110
It's over, Bob. Give up.

990
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:22,878
You know I can't do that, Pam.

991
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:24,871
<i>There's nowhere to run, Agent Stone.</i>

992
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:26,714
Just like Caracas.

993
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:31,239
Uh, Caracas would've worked
if you trusted me like Calvin trusts me.

994
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:32,549
No. No.

995
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:34,472
That is not true. I do not trust him!

996
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:36,710
I do not trust him at all.
As a matter of fact,

997
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:38,416
<i>this is a perfect time
for us to clear this up</i>

998
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:40,576
<i>especially in the middle of this standoff.
I shouldn't be here!</i>

999
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:43,160
So I feel like me being
in the middle of this throws me in it.

1000
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:44,639
So let me exclude myself.

1001
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:46,512
- Hey, stay down!
- Don't move!

1002
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:49,359
Okay, all right.
I'll stay in. I'll stay in.

1003
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:51,640
I got a plan.

1004
00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:53,554
Might get us both killed

1005
00:45:53,720 --> 00:45:55,536
but if it works,
it'll be a totally boss story.

1006
00:45:55,560 --> 00:45:56,560
Cool?

1007
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:58,676
- No! No, it's not cool!
- Cool.

1008
00:45:58,840 --> 00:45:59,989
No, I said it's not cool.

1009
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:01,673
I said it's not cool!

1010
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:02,989
Time's up.

1011
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:04,829
You're right, Pam.

1012
00:46:05,560 --> 00:46:06,629
My time is up.

1013
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:08,836
In three, two,

1014
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:10,680
one.

1015
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:20,396
Bob, Bob, Bob!

1016
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:23,394
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1017
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:25,234
Oh, shit!

1018
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,000
Whoo-hoo!

1019
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:45,717
Wow! Did you feel that, Jet?

1020
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:48,110
That was the balls right there!

1021
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:51,760
Hey, did you shit yourself a little bit?

1022
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:55,715
It's all right if you did. Totally cool.
I don't judge.

1023
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:02,200
Get it off!

1024
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:03,669
You guys order an Uber?

1025
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:07,549
What are you doing?

1026
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:09,816
You better get your tuches in the car.

1027
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:10,840
You're gonna get shot!

1028
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:12,149
Don't shoot me! Shoot him!

1029
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:14,834
Shoot him! I'm out! I'm out! I'm out!

1030
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,230
Let me in! Let me in! Let me in! Go, Bob!

1031
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:23,073
Hey, that's my car!

1032
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:24,760
Fuck you!

1033
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:26,958
You get zero stars!

1034
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,195
Put the word out to all assets.

1035
00:47:30,360 --> 00:47:31,918
I'm doubling the price on Bob's head.

1036
00:47:32,360 --> 00:47:33,918
Hey, what the shit,
honey...

1037
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:36,873
Get Larry on it.

1038
00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:43,235
Car, car, car!

1039
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:45,598
All right, here's the dilly-o, Jet.

1040
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:47,480
About three weeks ago,
an enemy of the state

1041
00:47:47,560 --> 00:47:48,788
codenamed "The Black Badger"

1042
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:51,918
stole the encryption keys
to the entire US spy satellite program

1043
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:53,336
<i>which he's gonna sell to a buyer</i>

1044
00:47:53,360 --> 00:47:55,256
<i>from that auction site
on your computer last night.</i>

1045
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:56,315
Bob...

1046
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:57,696
If we lose control of our satellites,

1047
00:47:57,720 --> 00:48:00,518
we're completely vulnerable
to any terrorist attacks.

1048
00:48:00,680 --> 00:48:02,736
That's why I had to go back
to your office and get you, Jet.

1049
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:04,512
I need your super sweet accounting skills

1050
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:06,680
<i>to help me figure out
the last piece of this puzzle</i>

1051
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:08,990
which is the transaction number
from the winning bid.

1052
00:48:09,160 --> 00:48:11,037
That'll tell us
where the deal is going down.

1053
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:15,036
That way, we can get The Black Badger.

1054
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:16,640
I can't do it without you, Jet.

1055
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:19,115
Are you kidding me? I'm not helping you.

1056
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:21,032
You attacked somebody with a banana.

1057
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:23,919
- A banana, force multiplier.
- What?

1058
00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:26,280
Well, basically what that means
is anything in your hand

1059
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:28,993
is far more dangerous
than just your bare hands alone,

1060
00:48:29,160 --> 00:48:30,160
including a banana.

1061
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:31,800
Oh!

1062
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:34,996
Oh! Ah!

1063
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:36,838
- A force multiplier!
- Yeah.

1064
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,479
Yeah, that's what it is.

1065
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:40,671
It makes so much more sense to me now.

1066
00:48:40,840 --> 00:48:43,035
That's page-one CIA stuff.

1067
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:46,590
I almost forgot
that I wasn't in the fucking CIA!

1068
00:48:47,560 --> 00:48:48,675
Stop the car.

1069
00:48:48,840 --> 00:48:50,717
You stop the car right now! Stop the car!

1070
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:52,757
Okay, okay. That's a great idea, Jet.

1071
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:54,558
We should get off the grid right now.

1072
00:48:55,880 --> 00:48:57,677
<i>Whoa!</i>

1073
00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:04,670
All right. We're clear.

1074
00:49:10,520 --> 00:49:11,669
Okay.

1075
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:14,350
Okay. Let's just take some deep breaths.

1076
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:16,033
Okay? Deep breaths.

1077
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:19,554
All you gotta do is get out of this car

1078
00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:21,711
and have a rational conversation with Bob

1079
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:23,279
and he'll understand.

1080
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:34,873
Robert, I would like to
go home now, please.

1081
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:36,712
Buddy, you and me both.

1082
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:39,110
But until we clear our names,
there's no going home.

1083
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:41,475
I'm sorry, can you clarify
that last sentence for me?

1084
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:42,960
Yeah, well, now that you're in...

1085
00:49:43,120 --> 00:49:45,236
Let me stop you right there. I'm not in.

1086
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:47,072
I never said that I was in.

1087
00:49:47,240 --> 00:49:49,993
In fact, I expressly remember
saying that I was out!

1088
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:51,480
I know, but they think you're in.

1089
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:52,800
I am...

1090
00:49:53,320 --> 00:49:55,231
I'm fucking out! I'm out!

1091
00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:56,536
- What's left to tell?
- Hey, no, I get it.

1092
00:49:56,560 --> 00:49:58,376
- I'm not in!
- I'm just saying they think you're in.

1093
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:01,358
- I'm not in! I am not in!
- I get it.

1094
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:03,591
<i>I'm not in! I'm out!</i>

1095
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:06,228
One sec, Jet, just gotta disable the GPS.

1096
00:50:06,680 --> 00:50:07,680
Where did you...

1097
00:50:08,120 --> 00:50:09,480
You wanna go under... That's fine!

1098
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:10,920
Wait a minute.

1099
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:12,400
You did this on purpose, didn't you?

1100
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:15,635
This whole thing was done on purpose.

1101
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:17,358
This is your plan!

1102
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:19,238
You tricked me!

1103
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:21,675
It's fine, but I know you tricked me.

1104
00:50:21,840 --> 00:50:23,360
- Trick you?
- You tricked... Hey, boy!

1105
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:25,556
What? What'd you just...

1106
00:50:25,720 --> 00:50:27,296
I didn't trick you,
you offered to help me.

1107
00:50:27,320 --> 00:50:28,840
You know what's funny? Harris told me.

1108
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:30,439
<i>She told me everything, man.</i>

1109
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:32,158
She told me that you stole the codes.

1110
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:34,256
Let me tell you something about Harris.
You can't trust her.

1111
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:36,520
She's already trying to frame me
for my partner's murder!

1112
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:38,592
- You killed your partner?
- No.

1113
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:39,800
I would never do that.

1114
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:41,473
The Black Badger killed my partner.

1115
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:44,080
Let me explain to you something, dude.
This is what happened.

1116
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:47,240
<i>After The Black Badger
stole the satellite encryption codes,</i>

1117
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:50,875
<i>my partner Phil and I
tracked him to a penthouse in Kiev.</i>

1118
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:52,155
- Hey, Phil.
- Yeah.

1119
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:54,040
I'll see you on the other side.

1120
00:50:55,320 --> 00:50:56,799
See you on the other side.

1121
00:50:58,120 --> 00:50:59,633
All right.

1122
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:01,313
God, I love that guy.

1123
00:51:01,480 --> 00:51:02,976
<i>He knew we were coming,
so he set a trap.</i>

1124
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,036
Hey, Bob! Bob!

1125
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:06,269
No!

1126
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:08,954
<i>Phil was my partner,
my teammate</i>

1127
00:51:09,720 --> 00:51:11,472
<i>- and I couldn't save him.</i>
- No!

1128
00:51:14,320 --> 00:51:15,878
It was awful, Cal.

1129
00:51:16,040 --> 00:51:17,560
It was a setup, right from the get-go.

1130
00:51:19,080 --> 00:51:20,115
Damn, man.

1131
00:51:20,680 --> 00:51:21,976
The Black Badger was never there.

1132
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,275
I should've been the one
on that elevator, not Phil.

1133
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:25,795
God.

1134
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,355
Okay. Bob, please...

1135
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:30,790
I'm begging you, man.
Can you just let me go home?

1136
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:32,473
CJ, I totally understand.

1137
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:34,437
But right now,
Agent Harris and her taskforce

1138
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:36,318
has that place surveilled up the yin-yang.

1139
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:38,160
She's got contract killers looking for us.

1140
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:39,468
Your place isn't safe.

1141
00:51:39,640 --> 00:51:41,312
Oh, my God. Maggie.

1142
00:51:41,480 --> 00:51:43,675
Maggie! What the hell
am I supposed to do about Maggie?

1143
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:47,880
Get down, Jet!

1144
00:51:56,600 --> 00:51:58,033
Shit! Oh!

1145
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:00,000
Look out, Bob!

1146
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,560
Who the hell is that? Who is that? Bob?

1147
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:15,948
Oh, shit.

1148
00:52:21,240 --> 00:52:22,240
Larry.

1149
00:52:25,320 --> 00:52:26,594
Thought you retired.

1150
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:27,760
I did.

1151
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:30,436
But you're worth a lot of money,
Bob, dead or alive.

1152
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:33,148
Well, tough luck,
because I've got back up.

1153
00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:34,389
Ain't that right, Jet?

1154
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:38,280
Jet!

1155
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:02,989
Hey, baby. I know. I'm sorry I'm late.

1156
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:05,270
The stupid Koplin deposition ran long.

1157
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:07,431
<i>I'm leaving right now.
I'll meet you at the house.</i>

1158
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:08,794
No, no, no! Don't go home!

1159
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:10,598
<i>- Don't go home!</i>
- Why? What's going on?

1160
00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:13,513
Nothing! Nothing.
I'm just running late, too.

1161
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:16,114
So I was gonna say
let's just meet at Dr. Dan's office.

1162
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:19,316
Yeah. Okay. Is everything all right?

1163
00:53:19,480 --> 00:53:21,789
Yeah! Yeah. Why?

1164
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:23,188
<i>Everything's fine.</i>

1165
00:53:23,360 --> 00:53:25,776
Because you kind of sound
like Ray Liotta at the end of <i>Goodfellas.</i>

1166
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:27,074
What?

1167
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:30,356
That's so funny, babe.
That's such a good reference.

1168
00:53:30,560 --> 00:53:32,312
That's classic Mags right there.

1169
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:35,273
So, okay. So you're not
gonna go home, right?

1170
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:36,708
Okay, fine. I won't go home.

1171
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:38,416
<i>I'll meet you at Dr. Dan's. See you soon.</i>

1172
00:53:38,440 --> 00:53:39,555
Okay. All right, bye.

1173
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:40,755
All right, bye.

1174
00:54:03,880 --> 00:54:04,880
Get in.

1175
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:25,949
I'm gonna
address the elephant in the room.

1176
00:54:26,120 --> 00:54:29,430
Okay, first of all, you...

1177
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:32,433
You guys, I want to say sorry to.

1178
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:36,149
Because what you're probably thinking
is not what happened.

1179
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:37,355
Accidents!

1180
00:54:37,720 --> 00:54:38,755
<i>I know you're like,</i>

1181
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:40,416
"How can you accidentally
pistol-whip somebody

1182
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:41,440
"and shoot somebody?"

1183
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:42,600
It can happen.

1184
00:54:42,760 --> 00:54:46,435
Okay? Today is proof
that it can happen. So...

1185
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:48,431
I'm glad I got to get that off my chest.

1186
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:50,678
Relax, Mr. Joyner. I believe you.

1187
00:54:50,840 --> 00:54:52,717
Okay, thank you.

1188
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:55,440
Trust me, I know a
scared-shitless civilian when I see one.

1189
00:54:55,640 --> 00:54:56,868
You don't have to convince me.

1190
00:54:57,040 --> 00:54:59,793
You got him over here. That is me.

1191
00:54:59,960 --> 00:55:01,791
Right now, I'm not comfortable.

1192
00:55:01,960 --> 00:55:03,678
Okay, I am scared, okay?

1193
00:55:03,840 --> 00:55:06,195
I don't have no shit in my system.

1194
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:08,356
<i>If I sat down on a toilet,
nothing's coming out.</i>

1195
00:55:08,520 --> 00:55:09,669
<i>Farts or just air.</i>

1196
00:55:16,320 --> 00:55:17,548
<i>It'd sound like lasers.</i>

1197
00:55:17,720 --> 00:55:19,153
Thank you for that description.

1198
00:55:19,720 --> 00:55:21,472
<i>Mr. Joyner, let me explain something.</i>

1199
00:55:21,640 --> 00:55:22,914
Bob's last forced psych eval

1200
00:55:23,080 --> 00:55:25,992
show a person rapidly losing
his grip on reality.

1201
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:27,673
Bob became obsessed with a ghost,

1202
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:29,354
a figment of his imagination,

1203
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:31,158
he started calling "The Black Badger."

1204
00:55:31,320 --> 00:55:33,311
<i>This obsession led to an instability,</i>

1205
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:36,153
first reported by his partner, Phil,
three weeks ago.

1206
00:55:36,320 --> 00:55:38,834
Just before Phil was killed in the field.

1207
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:40,194
Do you know how Phil died?

1208
00:55:40,360 --> 00:55:43,158
Yeah, Bob told me that
The Black Badger killed him.

1209
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:48,435
What?

1210
00:55:49,360 --> 00:55:50,360
What?

1211
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:54,274
Mr. Joyner, Bob Stone is The Black Badger.

1212
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:57,394
<i>Phil was Bob's partner of six years.</i>

1213
00:55:57,560 --> 00:55:58,560
<i>His best friend.</i>

1214
00:55:58,760 --> 00:56:01,035
- See you on the other side.
- See you on the other side.

1215
00:56:02,040 --> 00:56:03,519
Hey, Bob!

1216
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:06,000
<i>After he stole
the satellite encryption codes</i>

1217
00:56:06,120 --> 00:56:07,269
<i>Bob betrayed Phil.</i>

1218
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:08,440
No!

1219
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:11,873
<i>He killed him to cover his tracks.</i>

1220
00:56:15,880 --> 00:56:18,952
And, after that, Bob went rogue.

1221
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:20,918
This is all that's left of Phil.

1222
00:56:24,520 --> 00:56:27,193
Um, this is PornHub.

1223
00:56:27,960 --> 00:56:30,872
Oh, shit, shit, shit. Sorry.

1224
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:32,720
There you go.

1225
00:56:33,360 --> 00:56:36,636
Oh! Oh, God! Oh, I didn't see that coming.

1226
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:38,515
Oh, man!

1227
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,150
- It's a hell of a way to go.
- Okay, wait a minute.

1228
00:56:42,320 --> 00:56:44,776
Why wouldn't Bob just go sell
the satellite encryption codes himself?

1229
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:46,736
Because in a black market
blind-bidding situation,

1230
00:56:46,760 --> 00:56:48,536
the buyer and the seller,
they don't know each other.

1231
00:56:48,560 --> 00:56:51,080
They need the auction site
to tell them exactly where to meet up

1232
00:56:51,120 --> 00:56:52,320
and when to make the exchange.

1233
00:56:52,840 --> 00:56:55,912
<i>The transaction number
from the auction site gives them that,</i>

1234
00:56:56,080 --> 00:56:58,071
which means Bob still needs you.

1235
00:56:59,080 --> 00:57:00,216
Which is why we find ourselves

1236
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:02,549
in a little catch-and-release scenario.

1237
00:57:02,760 --> 00:57:04,796
<i>You are the only one Bob trusts.</i>

1238
00:57:05,600 --> 00:57:07,136
That's why we're putting you in the field.

1239
00:57:07,160 --> 00:57:09,037
The next time you're with Bob,

1240
00:57:10,080 --> 00:57:11,752
press this button.

1241
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:13,273
We're going to have him cold.

1242
00:57:19,560 --> 00:57:21,357
Now, go take care of your marriage.

1243
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:24,432
One more thing. Don't tell your wife shit.

1244
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:26,919
All right.

1245
00:57:28,840 --> 00:57:30,136
I just don't know
what's wrong.

1246
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:31,673
I mean, the man that I married,

1247
00:57:31,880 --> 00:57:33,916
the person I knew in high school,

1248
00:57:34,080 --> 00:57:38,198
he was filled
with drive and desire. I mean...

1249
00:57:38,360 --> 00:57:39,816
We used to sneak off every lunch hour

1250
00:57:39,840 --> 00:57:41,320
and make out under the gym bleachers.

1251
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:43,396
Like, that guy, back then,

1252
00:57:43,600 --> 00:57:45,750
<i>- he wanted things, you know?
- Hmm.</i>

1253
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:48,195
Hey, I'm sorry I'm late.
I couldn't find parking.

1254
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:50,336
Hi, no, no, it's okay.
We got started without you.

1255
00:57:50,360 --> 00:57:52,191
Babe, Calvin, this is Dr. Dan.

1256
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:53,709
Hello, Calvin.

1257
00:57:53,880 --> 00:57:55,996
- Oh, shit!
- Oh, jeez. What's the matter?

1258
00:57:56,200 --> 00:57:58,430
- Holy shit! Get behind me!
- Honey... Calvin, what?

1259
00:57:58,600 --> 00:58:00,875
It's okay, Maggie. It's okay. Just relax.

1260
00:58:01,080 --> 00:58:03,361
<i>This is a very common reaction
in the therapeutic process.</i>

1261
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:04,520
- It is?
- What?

1262
00:58:04,680 --> 00:58:05,680
<i>It is. It absolutely is.</i>

1263
00:58:05,840 --> 00:58:08,957
Calvin, this is a very safe place.
Please, sit down.

1264
00:58:09,120 --> 00:58:11,056
- This is not a safe place!
- No, no, no. Honey, it's a...

1265
00:58:11,080 --> 00:58:12,696
No, this is most definitely
not a safe place!

1266
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:14,517
<i>Me and my wife are leaving. Let's go.</i>

1267
00:58:14,680 --> 00:58:16,671
No, no, no! You are going to sit down,

1268
00:58:16,840 --> 00:58:19,798
and we are going to go through
this therapeutic process...

1269
00:58:19,960 --> 00:58:21,837
- Yes.
<i>- ...together, as a couple.</i>

1270
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:24,231
Um... Fine, fine, fine.

1271
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:25,879
Sit down. Thank you.

1272
00:58:26,040 --> 00:58:27,075
Fine.

1273
00:58:27,240 --> 00:58:30,994
Okay, guys. Why don't we start off
with a little bit of word association?

1274
00:58:31,160 --> 00:58:32,195
Okay.

1275
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:33,400
<i>This is exciting.</i>

1276
00:58:33,560 --> 00:58:35,516
<i>I've heard this can
really open a couple up.</i>

1277
00:58:36,280 --> 00:58:39,636
Uh, Maggie, I'm going
to offer you a word,

1278
00:58:39,800 --> 00:58:43,679
and you respond
however you're moved to from here.

1279
00:58:43,840 --> 00:58:44,875
Okay.

1280
00:58:45,080 --> 00:58:46,308
<i>- Black.</i>
- White.

1281
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:47,959
- Water.
- Ocean.

1282
00:58:48,120 --> 00:58:50,350
- Sunshine.
- Happy.

1283
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,468
- I'm very impressed, Maggie.
- Really?

1284
00:58:53,640 --> 00:58:54,914
You're very in tune.

1285
00:58:55,480 --> 00:58:56,879
I'm very in tune.

1286
00:58:57,040 --> 00:58:59,110
Calvin, you're next.

1287
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:00,952
I do not want to do this.

1288
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:03,794
Relax, Calvin. There are no wrong answers.

1289
00:59:03,960 --> 00:59:04,960
Up.

1290
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:07,675
Down.

1291
00:59:08,280 --> 00:59:09,280
Mmm.

1292
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:11,394
"Mmm." What is that?

1293
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:12,776
<i>What're you writing in your book?</i>

1294
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:14,296
- It's fine. Don't freak out.
- Nobody's freaking out.

1295
00:59:14,320 --> 00:59:16,096
I just don't understand
the rules to the game.

1296
00:59:16,120 --> 00:59:17,314
Freaking out.

1297
00:59:18,280 --> 00:59:20,191
<i>Let's switch gears for a second, okay?</i>

1298
00:59:21,640 --> 00:59:23,312
Maggie, during lovemaking,

1299
00:59:24,920 --> 00:59:27,992
have you ever placed anything
inside of Calvin's anus?

1300
00:59:28,160 --> 00:59:29,479
What the hell did you just say?

1301
00:59:29,640 --> 00:59:31,517
Well, yeah, there was this one time.

1302
00:59:31,680 --> 00:59:34,016
- You remember? <i>Game of Thrones</i> finale.
- What are you talking about?

1303
00:59:34,040 --> 00:59:36,076
I was Khaleesi, you were Littlefinger...

1304
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:38,879
- Okay, all right, stop. That's enough.
- Please, please, please.

1305
00:59:39,240 --> 00:59:42,516
Why don't we try a simple
role-playing exercise?

1306
00:59:42,720 --> 00:59:44,517
Calvin, you be Calvin

1307
00:59:44,720 --> 00:59:47,109
and I will become Maggie.

1308
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:48,793
Mmm.

1309
00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:50,839
I'm confused.

1310
00:59:55,520 --> 00:59:57,192
It's called "soul gazing."

1311
00:59:57,400 --> 01:00:00,995
Stare into my soul
and I'll stare into yours.

1312
01:00:01,720 --> 01:00:03,597
- Maggie, this...
- Hey. Shh.

1313
01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:05,830
There's no talking, and don't look away.

1314
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:07,353
Stare into my soul.

1315
01:00:07,880 --> 01:00:08,995
You are not my...

1316
01:00:09,160 --> 01:00:10,195
Shh. There's no talking.

1317
01:00:10,680 --> 01:00:12,238
Babe, I'm not staring...

1318
01:00:12,680 --> 01:00:15,672
Me and you.
Stay with me. I'm your wife.

1319
01:00:15,880 --> 01:00:17,520
You are not my wife.

1320
01:00:20,040 --> 01:00:21,393
How could you hit your wife?

1321
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:23,228
How can I... How can I what?

1322
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:24,992
- You hit your wife!
- No...

1323
01:00:25,160 --> 01:00:26,160
- He hit me!
- Okay.

1324
01:00:26,320 --> 01:00:27,320
- He hit you!
- Okay.

1325
01:00:27,480 --> 01:00:28,754
You hit us!

1326
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:35,216
- I'm swaddling you.
- I know what you're doing.

1327
01:00:35,240 --> 01:00:36,776
- I'm swaddling you.
- I know what you're...

1328
01:00:36,800 --> 01:00:37,800
Come here.

1329
01:00:38,360 --> 01:00:39,509
Oh, my God!

1330
01:00:39,960 --> 01:00:40,960
You...

1331
01:00:42,080 --> 01:00:44,514
You know what? We're leaving! Let's go!

1332
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:46,638
This is not real.

1333
01:00:46,800 --> 01:00:48,358
It's real to me.

1334
01:00:48,520 --> 01:00:49,714
<i>You know what, Calvin?</i>

1335
01:00:49,880 --> 01:00:52,030
If you can't commit
to working on our marriage,

1336
01:00:52,200 --> 01:00:53,792
then you need to let me know.

1337
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:55,319
Maggie, you...

1338
01:00:57,600 --> 01:00:59,238
- What!
- Oh, my God!

1339
01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:00,680
You're... Something's not right.

1340
01:01:00,760 --> 01:01:03,718
Come on, Jet, listen.
Come on, come on, Jet!

1341
01:01:03,880 --> 01:01:05,976
Now, I know things got
a little rough there at the end.

1342
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,376
But the truth is, with all the heat
that you have coming down on you,

1343
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:10,311
Maggie is definitely safer without you.

1344
01:01:11,400 --> 01:01:13,675
And, trust me,
when this whole thing is said and done

1345
01:01:13,840 --> 01:01:15,536
and you basically
save the entire free world,

1346
01:01:15,560 --> 01:01:17,949
she's going to forgive you.
It'll all work itself out.

1347
01:01:18,120 --> 01:01:19,553
It'll all work itself out?

1348
01:01:20,360 --> 01:01:22,416
Okay, Bob, you know,
I'm sick of playing games with you.

1349
01:01:22,440 --> 01:01:23,839
Where's the real Dr. Dan?

1350
01:01:24,600 --> 01:01:25,669
What-what?

1351
01:01:25,840 --> 01:01:28,752
Oh, my... Dr. Dan,
I had nothing to do with this.

1352
01:01:28,920 --> 01:01:30,376
He's fine. I'll get you some water
in a little bit.

1353
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:32,630
- Thanks, doc.
- You know...

1354
01:01:32,880 --> 01:01:34,791
That's it. That is it.

1355
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:36,638
That is it.

1356
01:01:38,040 --> 01:01:39,075
All right, Jet.

1357
01:01:39,240 --> 01:01:41,231
I see that Harris has given you
a button to push.

1358
01:01:42,200 --> 01:01:44,840
Relax, I would've taken the same deal,
too, if I was in your shoes.

1359
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:47,269
Otherwise, she wouldn't
let you out of her sight, right?

1360
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:48,873
It makes perfect sense.

1361
01:01:50,080 --> 01:01:51,960
But you're not going to
press the button, right?

1362
01:01:53,120 --> 01:01:55,156
You got the top-secret satellite codes?

1363
01:01:55,720 --> 01:01:56,948
Yes or no?

1364
01:01:57,120 --> 01:01:58,917
This ain't the time to bullshit me.

1365
01:01:59,080 --> 01:02:00,798
Okay, my ass is sweating.

1366
01:02:00,960 --> 01:02:02,200
I'm nervous. Don't bullshit me!

1367
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:04,470
Of course not, dude. Hey, hey, come on!

1368
01:02:04,640 --> 01:02:05,960
Of course I don't have the codes.

1369
01:02:06,120 --> 01:02:07,736
Why would I go through
all this trouble, then?

1370
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:09,990
I need your skill set, Jet, to help me get

1371
01:02:10,200 --> 01:02:12,270
the bank transaction numbers
to the winning bid.

1372
01:02:12,440 --> 01:02:14,112
We already know it's going down tonight

1373
01:02:14,280 --> 01:02:15,720
from the countdown on your computer.

1374
01:02:15,800 --> 01:02:17,279
Now, all we need is the "where."

1375
01:02:17,720 --> 01:02:20,001
And the bank transaction numbers
will give us the "where."

1376
01:02:20,080 --> 01:02:21,274
That's why I need you.

1377
01:02:21,440 --> 01:02:22,793
Your job gives you access to

1378
01:02:22,960 --> 01:02:24,678
exactly that kind of information.

1379
01:02:24,880 --> 01:02:26,950
Then we can get The Badger,
we can get the buyer

1380
01:02:27,120 --> 01:02:28,189
in one fell swoop.

1381
01:02:28,360 --> 01:02:30,078
And it'll all be over tonight.

1382
01:02:30,280 --> 01:02:31,474
Please, I swear.

1383
01:02:31,680 --> 01:02:33,113
You gotta believe me.

1384
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,070
Can't you just get us
the transaction number?

1385
01:02:45,480 --> 01:02:47,755
Not when the money
originates from an offshore account.

1386
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:48,920
When that happens,

1387
01:02:49,080 --> 01:02:51,416
then only a certified international
banking official can access it.

1388
01:02:51,440 --> 01:02:53,520
But, it shouldn't be a problem.
We just give this guy

1389
01:02:53,680 --> 01:02:55,480
the offshore account numbers
that you gave me,

1390
01:02:55,600 --> 01:02:57,216
then he can give us the transaction number

1391
01:02:57,240 --> 01:02:59,536
without knowing that
he's committing treason when he does it.

1392
01:02:59,560 --> 01:03:00,754
Sound familiar?

1393
01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:02,996
Ouch! Low blow, CJ.

1394
01:03:03,160 --> 01:03:05,071
Hey, besides,
it's only treason if we're wrong.

1395
01:03:05,240 --> 01:03:06,559
Who's this mystery man?

1396
01:03:07,960 --> 01:03:08,960
It's Trevor.

1397
01:03:13,680 --> 01:03:14,795
Trevor.

1398
01:03:17,600 --> 01:03:19,320
<i>This week
just keeps getting better.</i>

1399
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:20,634
You know, I mean,

1400
01:03:20,960 --> 01:03:24,316
Robbie Wheirdicht and Calvin
"The Golden Jet" Joyner in my office.

1401
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:26,436
<i>Who would've thunk it? Not me.</i>

1402
01:03:26,600 --> 01:03:28,431
This is great, huh?

1403
01:03:28,600 --> 01:03:30,591
<i>Talk about caterpillar to the butterfly...</i>

1404
01:03:30,760 --> 01:03:32,671
What is this? P90X?

1405
01:03:32,840 --> 01:03:35,718
More like "P1,000,000X," huh?

1406
01:03:35,880 --> 01:03:37,438
<i>Congratulations.</i>

1407
01:03:37,880 --> 01:03:39,359
<i>Hey, I, um...</i>

1408
01:03:39,520 --> 01:03:41,000
I really appreciate the help, Trevor.

1409
01:03:41,120 --> 01:03:43,440
My client's all on me
to get this stuff handled right away.

1410
01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:44,669
So, you know, if we could...

1411
01:03:44,880 --> 01:03:46,791
Say no more.
It's my pleasure. I've been there.

1412
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:48,576
These international accounts
can be very, very tricky

1413
01:03:48,600 --> 01:03:49,816
if you don't have the right clearances.

1414
01:03:49,840 --> 01:03:51,592
<i>You can get a bunch of digital red tape.</i>

1415
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:53,956
I'm happy to help, you know?

1416
01:03:54,120 --> 01:03:55,155
Robbie.

1417
01:03:55,320 --> 01:03:57,117
You're such a blast from the past, buddy.

1418
01:03:57,280 --> 01:03:58,416
How long has it been since I saw you?

1419
01:03:58,440 --> 01:03:59,475
Was it high school?

1420
01:04:02,480 --> 01:04:03,480
What's that?

1421
01:04:03,640 --> 01:04:06,080
Um... How we doing
with those account access codes?

1422
01:04:06,240 --> 01:04:07,416
- Are they coming?
<i>- It's coming.</i>

1423
01:04:07,440 --> 01:04:08,800
- Everything's good?
<i>- It's coming.</i>

1424
01:04:08,840 --> 01:04:11,416
<i>I'm going as fast as I can. I know
you guys are in a rush. I'm so sorry.</i>

1425
01:04:11,440 --> 01:04:13,476
Anything for a couple of fellow Centaurs.

1426
01:04:13,640 --> 01:04:16,393
Speaking of which, you guys are going
to the reunion tonight, right?

1427
01:04:18,440 --> 01:04:20,158
No, I don't think so.

1428
01:04:20,320 --> 01:04:21,616
You're both going.

1429
01:04:21,640 --> 01:04:23,358
Here it is.
Here's your transaction number.

1430
01:04:23,520 --> 01:04:25,256
You're both going
because you want to know what?

1431
01:04:25,280 --> 01:04:26,560
Stinky Pete's going to be there.

1432
01:04:26,680 --> 01:04:29,592
And Jimmy Longballs called me.
He's going to be hanging.

1433
01:04:30,360 --> 01:04:33,272
Carlos Nagasaki, the Mexican eggroll.
He's going to be there.

1434
01:04:33,800 --> 01:04:35,791
You guys will be missing out on a big one.

1435
01:04:35,960 --> 01:04:37,256
<i>Plus you know what they're going to do?</i>

1436
01:04:37,280 --> 01:04:39,416
They're going to vote on
homecoming king and queen again.

1437
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:41,200
<i>Maybe you and Maggie
can make it two for two.</i>

1438
01:04:41,360 --> 01:04:43,510
Now, before you go,
stay seated one second.

1439
01:04:43,680 --> 01:04:45,352
Give me two minutes, sit down.

1440
01:04:46,040 --> 01:04:47,632
Men,

1441
01:04:48,160 --> 01:04:49,479
a few years ago...

1442
01:04:50,680 --> 01:04:52,636
I found the Lord Almighty.

1443
01:04:52,800 --> 01:04:53,800
And, ever since then,

1444
01:04:53,960 --> 01:04:56,793
my life has been
completely different. Okay?

1445
01:04:56,960 --> 01:04:59,315
He's got a plan for
each and every one of us

1446
01:04:59,480 --> 01:05:01,357
and, in his infinite wisdom,

1447
01:05:01,520 --> 01:05:03,750
he makes no mistakes. Hmm?

1448
01:05:04,320 --> 01:05:05,639
You're right about that.

1449
01:05:05,800 --> 01:05:07,136
I think the Lord put you here because

1450
01:05:07,160 --> 01:05:08,656
he wants me to get something off my chest.

1451
01:05:08,680 --> 01:05:10,040
He wants me to clear my conscience

1452
01:05:10,160 --> 01:05:11,720
and he wants me to ask for forgiveness.

1453
01:05:11,880 --> 01:05:12,880
Robert.

1454
01:05:13,080 --> 01:05:15,514
What I did to you
at that rally in senior year

1455
01:05:15,720 --> 01:05:17,153
was a cowardly act.

1456
01:05:17,320 --> 01:05:19,675
It's something that
I've regretted every single day.

1457
01:05:19,840 --> 01:05:22,832
Yeah. I mean,
bullying is a national crisis.

1458
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:27,357
It can leave people
with a lifetime of pain.

1459
01:05:27,520 --> 01:05:30,956
And I just have no excuse
for what I did to you.

1460
01:05:31,120 --> 01:05:33,536
I mean, I did grow up in a house
with a father who was physical,

1461
01:05:33,560 --> 01:05:35,960
but that doesn't give me
the right to take it out on somebody

1462
01:05:36,040 --> 01:05:38,508
who at the time
was weaker, you know? So...

1463
01:05:38,880 --> 01:05:41,997
Calvin, with this particular
transgression,

1464
01:05:42,160 --> 01:05:45,675
I not only embarrassed him
but I also ruined your final speech.

1465
01:05:45,840 --> 01:05:47,478
- No, no.
- Yes, I did.

1466
01:05:47,640 --> 01:05:50,096
- It's okay. No, it's okay.
- No, really, I stole your thunder.

1467
01:05:50,120 --> 01:05:52,656
And it's another thing that
I've had to live with every single day.

1468
01:05:52,680 --> 01:05:55,513
And I work through it
in individual therapy as well as group,

1469
01:05:55,720 --> 01:05:57,392
and I pray about it.

1470
01:05:59,200 --> 01:06:00,315
So...

1471
01:06:03,720 --> 01:06:07,918
I just want to say how truly sorry I am

1472
01:06:08,080 --> 01:06:10,594
for what happened, you know.

1473
01:06:10,760 --> 01:06:12,193
Or for what I did.

1474
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:13,680
It didn't just happen. I did it.

1475
01:06:13,840 --> 01:06:16,559
I did it, and I wish to God
that I had not done it.

1476
01:06:17,080 --> 01:06:20,197
So, I'm hoping that
you can find it in your heart

1477
01:06:21,400 --> 01:06:23,277
to forgive me.

1478
01:06:25,080 --> 01:06:27,196
I wasn't expecting this at all.

1479
01:06:27,360 --> 01:06:29,032
Don't I know it. I know it.

1480
01:06:30,240 --> 01:06:31,719
I'm just so happy.

1481
01:06:32,840 --> 01:06:34,398
I don't know what to say.

1482
01:06:35,160 --> 01:06:36,752
How about you say...

1483
01:06:38,240 --> 01:06:42,199
"The Oscar goes to Trevor Olson."

1484
01:06:45,640 --> 01:06:47,232
What do you mean?

1485
01:06:55,400 --> 01:06:56,674
Weird Dick!

1486
01:06:56,840 --> 01:06:58,432
You stupid ass!

1487
01:06:58,600 --> 01:07:00,272
Good God, you're dumb!

1488
01:07:00,440 --> 01:07:02,351
Dumber than ever, I guess!

1489
01:07:02,520 --> 01:07:04,272
And you, too, Calvin!

1490
01:07:04,440 --> 01:07:07,079
Look at that stupid look
on those two faces.

1491
01:07:07,240 --> 01:07:10,073
"The Lord taught me to care."
Unbelievable.

1492
01:07:10,240 --> 01:07:13,516
I'm a Scientologist. Okay, that's "A."

1493
01:07:13,680 --> 01:07:15,955
And thetan-free since 2003.

1494
01:07:16,120 --> 01:07:17,120
Clear as shit.

1495
01:07:17,280 --> 01:07:18,520
<i>And "I'm sorry for what I did"?</i>

1496
01:07:18,720 --> 01:07:20,056
Let me tell you what I'm sorry about.

1497
01:07:20,080 --> 01:07:22,616
I'm sorry I didn't toss your naked ass
out there three more times.

1498
01:07:22,640 --> 01:07:24,000
<i>It was the best senior prank ever.</i>

1499
01:07:24,120 --> 01:07:25,599
<i>I still get emails about it.</i>

1500
01:07:25,840 --> 01:07:27,680
And if I'd had
one of these bad boys back then,

1501
01:07:27,840 --> 01:07:29,200
I would have shot it, uploaded it,

1502
01:07:29,320 --> 01:07:31,754
and it would have gone crazy viral,
a zillion hits.

1503
01:07:31,920 --> 01:07:32,955
Know what?

1504
01:07:33,120 --> 01:07:34,856
You're going to regret
you ever opened your mouth.

1505
01:07:34,880 --> 01:07:37,269
- You hear me, Trevor?
- Yeah? How come, Calvin?

1506
01:07:37,440 --> 01:07:39,056
Because he's about to
whoop your ass, that's why.

1507
01:07:39,080 --> 01:07:40,080
Who is?

1508
01:07:40,280 --> 01:07:41,456
Bob, get up and whoop his ass.

1509
01:07:41,480 --> 01:07:43,550
Here she comes!
Let me tell you something...

1510
01:07:43,720 --> 01:07:46,598
Weird Dick can't chug
a bunch of fucking steroids and elk urine

1511
01:07:46,760 --> 01:07:48,637
and suddenly be able to kick my ass.

1512
01:07:48,800 --> 01:07:50,791
Fuck that! It ain't gonna happen.

1513
01:07:51,160 --> 01:07:52,434
'Cause here's why.

1514
01:07:53,840 --> 01:07:57,355
Once a fat kid, always a fat kid.

1515
01:07:57,880 --> 01:07:58,995
<i>Huh? Prove me wrong.</i>

1516
01:07:59,160 --> 01:08:00,800
Bob, come on. Do what you did in the bar.

1517
01:08:11,640 --> 01:08:13,710
Come on, hit me!

1518
01:08:13,880 --> 01:08:16,155
And I'll sue your ass,
and take your fanny pack away.

1519
01:08:18,280 --> 01:08:19,713
You got to make poopies?

1520
01:08:20,080 --> 01:08:21,080
What's wrong, Bob?

1521
01:08:21,280 --> 01:08:22,315
We got a john here.

1522
01:08:22,840 --> 01:08:24,671
Or you got to change your rag?

1523
01:08:25,400 --> 01:08:26,400
Maybe that's it.

1524
01:08:26,760 --> 01:08:28,512
Jenny, you got an extra rag?

1525
01:08:29,720 --> 01:08:31,711
- What's the matter with you?
- I just want to go.

1526
01:08:31,880 --> 01:08:33,154
She wants to go.

1527
01:08:33,880 --> 01:08:35,871
Go ahead. There you go.

1528
01:08:36,480 --> 01:08:37,549
No, it's a push.

1529
01:08:37,720 --> 01:08:39,915
Boy, 50-50 shot. You missed that.

1530
01:08:40,080 --> 01:08:41,399
At least you found the handle.

1531
01:08:41,560 --> 01:08:44,028
Boy, he's still a scared little bitch.

1532
01:08:44,200 --> 01:08:45,560
You know, you're still an asshole.

1533
01:08:45,720 --> 01:08:47,756
Yeah, well, you're still
shorter than my cat.

1534
01:08:48,560 --> 01:08:49,800
Here's your transaction number.

1535
01:08:50,080 --> 01:08:51,559
Hit it, dick licker.

1536
01:08:53,200 --> 01:08:55,156
- Thank you, Trevor.
- Yup.

1537
01:08:56,120 --> 01:08:57,838
Glad to see you haven't changed a bit.

1538
01:08:58,000 --> 01:08:59,000
<i>Bye-bye now.</i>

1539
01:08:59,160 --> 01:09:00,560
- Was it push or pull?
<i>- Clean push.</i>

1540
01:09:00,600 --> 01:09:02,296
- Which one is it?
<i>- You want me to do it for you?</i>

1541
01:09:02,320 --> 01:09:03,320
Which one is it?

1542
01:09:04,560 --> 01:09:07,120
Hey, hey, hey! Goddamn it, Joyner!

1543
01:09:07,280 --> 01:09:08,429
<i>Jenny!</i>

1544
01:09:08,600 --> 01:09:11,478
Jenny, get the Windex!
And security for this one.

1545
01:09:11,640 --> 01:09:13,915
Get your asshole off my door! That's it!

1546
01:09:15,480 --> 01:09:17,357
Bob! Bob!

1547
01:09:17,680 --> 01:09:19,511
Bob! Bob! Bob!

1548
01:09:26,640 --> 01:09:28,835
<i>Mr. Joyner. Guess who
we're about to arrest</i>

1549
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:30,956
<i>for conspiracy to commit treason.</i>

1550
01:09:33,720 --> 01:09:36,188
<i>That's right. Your lovely wife.</i>

1551
01:09:36,400 --> 01:09:38,152
<i>So, here's what you're going to do.</i>

1552
01:09:38,360 --> 01:09:40,874
<i>You're going to tell us
exactly where you and Bob are.</i>

1553
01:09:41,040 --> 01:09:43,496
Then you're going to go outside
and you're going to keep Bob on-site

1554
01:09:43,520 --> 01:09:44,555
until we arrive.

1555
01:09:44,800 --> 01:09:46,995
And if he leaves, you lose.

1556
01:09:47,760 --> 01:09:49,318
<i>Is that clear?</i>

1557
01:09:54,840 --> 01:09:55,840
Oh, hey.

1558
01:09:56,040 --> 01:09:57,416
I don't know what happened in there,

1559
01:09:57,440 --> 01:09:58,589
and I just froze up.

1560
01:09:58,760 --> 01:10:00,432
I locked up. I'm sorry.

1561
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:02,035
Look, Bob, I...

1562
01:10:02,200 --> 01:10:04,555
No, I gotta tell you something,
CJ, listen.

1563
01:10:04,760 --> 01:10:06,600
You're the only one
who's ever been nice to me,

1564
01:10:06,760 --> 01:10:08,637
the only one who's never laughed at me.

1565
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:11,917
And you're the only one
in this whole world that I trust.

1566
01:10:12,080 --> 01:10:14,036
And I know you have a lot of friends,

1567
01:10:16,600 --> 01:10:17,635
but I don't.

1568
01:10:19,440 --> 01:10:20,793
You're my only friend, Calvin.

1569
01:10:21,480 --> 01:10:24,074
And I will never
let you down again, I promise.

1570
01:10:25,840 --> 01:10:27,398
I'm sorry, man.

1571
01:10:31,080 --> 01:10:32,195
Sorry for what?

1572
01:10:32,360 --> 01:10:34,032
I told Harris where we are.

1573
01:10:35,080 --> 01:10:36,638
They were going to hurt Maggie.

1574
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:38,756
I had to. I didn't have a choice.

1575
01:10:39,280 --> 01:10:40,395
I'm sorry.

1576
01:10:45,480 --> 01:10:47,391
Freeze, Bob! Hands on your head!

1577
01:10:47,560 --> 01:10:48,560
Do it now!

1578
01:11:19,120 --> 01:11:20,633
I know you know how this goes,

1579
01:11:20,800 --> 01:11:22,313
so I'll spare you the dramatics.

1580
01:11:22,480 --> 01:11:24,550
I'll ask you just once.

1581
01:11:24,720 --> 01:11:26,950
Where are the satellite encryption codes?

1582
01:11:29,080 --> 01:11:31,116
Aw. What's the matter, Bob?

1583
01:11:31,840 --> 01:11:34,991
Are you upset that
your friend turned you in?

1584
01:11:35,560 --> 01:11:37,198
<i>I don't have any friends.</i>

1585
01:11:37,360 --> 01:11:39,032
Okay, I don't want to watch this, guys.

1586
01:11:39,200 --> 01:11:40,599
Don't worry, it'll be over quick.

1587
01:11:40,760 --> 01:11:42,318
She always gets them to break.

1588
01:11:42,520 --> 01:11:44,875
<i>Okay. You have it your way.</i>

1589
01:11:45,040 --> 01:11:46,632
<i>We're going to do this old-school.</i>

1590
01:11:54,680 --> 01:11:56,591
Get the extraction tools.

1591
01:11:58,360 --> 01:12:00,316
The extraction tools?

1592
01:12:00,680 --> 01:12:02,636
If you don't have the stomach for it,
you can go.

1593
01:12:03,440 --> 01:12:04,919
Come on.

1594
01:12:07,560 --> 01:12:08,595
Stop recording.

1595
01:12:18,800 --> 01:12:20,920
Why am I coming here?
I was told I'd be able to leave.

1596
01:12:20,960 --> 01:12:22,029
You can leave,

1597
01:12:22,200 --> 01:12:23,680
when Agent Harris says you can leave,

1598
01:12:23,800 --> 01:12:24,869
<i>which might be never.</i>

1599
01:12:25,080 --> 01:12:26,433
I gotta watch this.

1600
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:36,313
I'm sorry, Bob.

1601
01:12:36,800 --> 01:12:38,074
I'm sorry, man.

1602
01:12:51,280 --> 01:12:52,395
Oh, Jesus!

1603
01:13:00,240 --> 01:13:01,240
What the hell?

1604
01:13:02,800 --> 01:13:04,472
Hey! Hey!

1605
01:13:06,040 --> 01:13:07,040
Don't move!

1606
01:13:07,200 --> 01:13:09,634
You get your hands off!
Get them off the keyboard!

1607
01:13:09,800 --> 01:13:11,880
- What are you doing, Calvin?
- Give me your keycard!

1608
01:13:12,080 --> 01:13:13,593
<i>Give me your keycard!</i>

1609
01:13:14,200 --> 01:13:15,200
<i>Give it to me.</i>

1610
01:13:15,640 --> 01:13:16,675
- Okay...
- Go sit down.

1611
01:13:16,840 --> 01:13:18,432
Okay. Yeah.

1612
01:13:18,600 --> 01:13:19,919
Sorry. I'm sorry.

1613
01:13:20,120 --> 01:13:22,111
- Sit down! Sit down!
- Okay, okay, okay.

1614
01:13:24,360 --> 01:13:25,360
You know, Bob?

1615
01:13:25,520 --> 01:13:28,159
<i>This is actually
my favorite part of the job.</i>

1616
01:13:28,320 --> 01:13:30,550
<i>Thank you for being so uncooperative.</i>

1617
01:13:30,720 --> 01:13:32,336
What do you think
your little buddy, Joyner,

1618
01:13:32,360 --> 01:13:33,960
would say if he could see you like this?

1619
01:13:34,120 --> 01:13:35,120
Two words.

1620
01:13:35,280 --> 01:13:36,315
I'm in.

1621
01:13:37,320 --> 01:13:39,151
What-what?

1622
01:13:39,480 --> 01:13:41,835
You're making a big mistake, Mr. Joyner.

1623
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:43,956
That's only if I'm wrong.

1624
01:13:45,800 --> 01:13:47,313
Come on, Bob. Let's go!

1625
01:13:47,520 --> 01:13:49,351
What're you doing? Come on, man!

1626
01:13:50,800 --> 01:13:52,995
Okay, listen to me. Bob, I'm sorry.

1627
01:13:53,160 --> 01:13:55,116
I'm sorry I double-crossed you.
You hear me?

1628
01:13:55,320 --> 01:13:57,496
I should've believed you,
I should've trusted you, and I didn't.

1629
01:13:57,520 --> 01:13:58,520
I'm sorry for that.

1630
01:13:58,680 --> 01:14:01,240
Listen to me. Bob,
we don't have time for this, man!

1631
01:14:01,400 --> 01:14:03,516
I need you to tap into
that super-spy stuff

1632
01:14:03,680 --> 01:14:06,592
and I need you to get us the hell
out of here right now. Do you hear me?

1633
01:14:06,840 --> 01:14:08,592
I'm not a super spy, Calvin.

1634
01:14:09,680 --> 01:14:11,796
I'm Robbie Wheirdicht, super tool.

1635
01:14:11,960 --> 01:14:14,030
No, stop. You're not a super tool.

1636
01:14:14,200 --> 01:14:16,589
You're not even Robbie Wheirdicht.
You're Bob Stone!

1637
01:14:17,200 --> 01:14:18,920
- I made that name up.
- So what?

1638
01:14:19,040 --> 01:14:21,400
- It's not real.
- What does that mean? What does that mean?

1639
01:14:21,440 --> 01:14:25,194
You think Mr. T and Sting
were born with those names?

1640
01:14:26,920 --> 01:14:28,896
How do you think I got
the name "Golden Jet" at high school?

1641
01:14:28,920 --> 01:14:31,832
- 'Cause you're awesome.
- No, that's not how.

1642
01:14:32,720 --> 01:14:35,359
In the eighth grade, I ran track.
It was my first race.

1643
01:14:35,520 --> 01:14:38,398
Okay, the race came down
to me and this other kid.

1644
01:14:38,560 --> 01:14:40,039
I wanted to win the race so damn bad

1645
01:14:40,240 --> 01:14:42,390
that I ended up peeing in my pants
at the finish line.

1646
01:14:42,640 --> 01:14:44,392
That's how I got the name "Golden Jet."

1647
01:14:45,120 --> 01:14:48,160
So, take it from a guy who's literally
pissed his pants in front of everybody

1648
01:14:48,200 --> 01:14:49,553
just to win a race.

1649
01:14:49,800 --> 01:14:51,711
You are who you decide to be.

1650
01:14:52,240 --> 01:14:54,993
And you chose to be
an international CIA spy.

1651
01:14:55,360 --> 01:14:57,320
Come on, man.
You get to kill people for a living.

1652
01:14:57,760 --> 01:14:58,760
How cool is that?

1653
01:15:00,920 --> 01:15:03,115
I don't know.

1654
01:15:03,400 --> 01:15:04,400
Kinda cool I guess.

1655
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,116
What do you mean "kinda cool"?
Ain't no kinda cool.

1656
01:15:07,480 --> 01:15:09,436
Stop it! It's awesome.

1657
01:15:09,760 --> 01:15:11,079
Now, come on, man. We boys?

1658
01:15:12,760 --> 01:15:13,760
- We're boys.
- Oh!

1659
01:15:15,440 --> 01:15:16,440
Sorry, Jet.

1660
01:15:16,920 --> 01:15:18,592
Oh, God!

1661
01:15:19,520 --> 01:15:20,520
Oh, God!

1662
01:15:20,920 --> 01:15:22,512
See? Good as new.

1663
01:15:23,800 --> 01:15:25,631
Wow. Sorry, man.

1664
01:15:29,560 --> 01:15:30,595
Go, go!

1665
01:15:31,120 --> 01:15:32,296
Get me out!

1666
01:15:32,320 --> 01:15:34,197
He got the jump on us. Give me the key.

1667
01:15:37,600 --> 01:15:39,040
Look out, Bob!

1668
01:15:39,760 --> 01:15:41,876
Here, Jet! Get him!

1669
01:15:42,040 --> 01:15:43,439
Watch out!

1670
01:15:52,120 --> 01:15:53,473
Did you see that, Bob?

1671
01:15:53,640 --> 01:15:55,710
I did the thing! I did the thing, Bob!

1672
01:15:55,880 --> 01:15:56,880
Yeah!

1673
01:15:57,040 --> 01:15:58,951
Yeah! Yeah!

1674
01:15:59,240 --> 01:16:00,640
- Come on! Follow me!
- Let's do it!

1675
01:16:00,760 --> 01:16:03,320
No! What the fuck am I doing?
Here! You get the gun.

1676
01:16:03,480 --> 01:16:05,118
- I'm behind you. Go.
- All right.

1677
01:16:09,680 --> 01:16:11,511
Oh, my God. There's two of them.

1678
01:16:11,680 --> 01:16:14,114
Yeah, I'll distract them
and you open the door, okay?

1679
01:16:14,280 --> 01:16:15,679
- What? No!
- Let's roll.

1680
01:16:15,880 --> 01:16:16,915
No, no.

1681
01:16:18,880 --> 01:16:20,154
Go, go!

1682
01:16:20,880 --> 01:16:23,030
- Close in!
- Moving out!

1683
01:16:23,200 --> 01:16:25,111
- Freeze, Bob!
<i>- Sorry about this, guys.</i>

1684
01:16:28,280 --> 01:16:29,838
<i>Nope, come here.</i>

1685
01:16:39,920 --> 01:16:41,194
Come on.

1686
01:16:41,360 --> 01:16:43,590
Wrong keycard, pal. Turn around.

1687
01:16:45,680 --> 01:16:46,829
You needed this one.

1688
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:48,228
On the ground, now.

1689
01:16:48,400 --> 01:16:49,674
Can I say something first?

1690
01:16:49,840 --> 01:16:51,398
- What?
- This is going to hurt.

1691
01:16:54,280 --> 01:16:56,600
- Hey, get the keycard! Let's roll.
- All right, all right.

1692
01:16:59,200 --> 01:17:00,474
Which car are we taking?

1693
01:17:02,520 --> 01:17:03,555
Not that one.

1694
01:17:03,760 --> 01:17:05,352
Oh, my God.

1695
01:17:05,920 --> 01:17:07,717
Oh, God. Oh, sh...

1696
01:17:08,640 --> 01:17:09,640
Oh.

1697
01:17:09,960 --> 01:17:11,154
Here we go, Jet.

1698
01:17:13,280 --> 01:17:15,720
- Bob, they are shooting at us!
- It's okay, it's bulletproof.

1699
01:17:15,880 --> 01:17:16,880
Drive, drive!

1700
01:17:28,760 --> 01:17:29,954
Here you go, Jet.

1701
01:17:30,680 --> 01:17:31,680
What's this?

1702
01:17:31,840 --> 01:17:33,876
Bug-out bag, courtesy of the CIA.

1703
01:17:34,080 --> 01:17:35,536
Go ahead and grab that
encrypted phone in there.

1704
01:17:35,560 --> 01:17:36,560
For what?

1705
01:17:36,720 --> 01:17:38,360
You still have the bank transaction code?

1706
01:17:38,520 --> 01:17:41,440
How are transaction numbers gonna help us
find out where the bad guys are?

1707
01:17:41,600 --> 01:17:44,200
Well, it's not bank transaction
numbers or codes, it's actually...

1708
01:17:44,280 --> 01:17:45,793
Longitude and latitude.

1709
01:17:47,200 --> 01:17:50,909
Look at the spy brain
on the Jet! What-what!

1710
01:17:51,240 --> 01:17:53,470
You're like a chocolate Google.

1711
01:17:53,640 --> 01:17:55,676
Bob, don't do that. Stop it. Stop it.

1712
01:17:55,840 --> 01:17:57,056
You're getting good at this, man.

1713
01:17:57,080 --> 01:17:59,056
Yeah, you're absolutely right.
It's longitude and latitude.

1714
01:17:59,080 --> 01:18:02,516
All you gotta do is plug those
digits into the GPS, and boom!

1715
01:18:02,720 --> 01:18:05,280
<i>We're gonna catch the buyer
and The Badger, just like that.</i>

1716
01:18:07,440 --> 01:18:09,112
Boston.

1717
01:18:12,640 --> 01:18:14,312
We're gonna need a plane.

1718
01:18:27,720 --> 01:18:28,994
You ever steal a plane before?

1719
01:18:29,160 --> 01:18:31,435
- I stole some Starbursts one time.
- Mmm-hmm.

1720
01:18:31,880 --> 01:18:33,950
So I don't know
if that compares or anything,

1721
01:18:34,120 --> 01:18:35,553
but I wasn't successful with that.

1722
01:18:35,720 --> 01:18:36,920
On the way out, I dropped 'em.

1723
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:38,376
Dropped the whole bag. The guy caught me.

1724
01:18:38,400 --> 01:18:40,136
<i>"What's that? " I just said, "A Starburst."</i>

1725
01:18:40,160 --> 01:18:42,151
Told him myself. It was a mess.

1726
01:18:44,960 --> 01:18:47,394
Check it out. The universe provides.

1727
01:18:49,920 --> 01:18:50,920
<i>Oh.</i>

1728
01:18:52,880 --> 01:18:53,880
Golden Jet.

1729
01:18:54,120 --> 01:18:55,519
- Golden Jet.
<i>- Golden Jet.</i>

1730
01:18:59,440 --> 01:19:01,317
- It's just one guard in there.
- All right.

1731
01:19:01,480 --> 01:19:03,118
90% of spy work is distraction.

1732
01:19:03,280 --> 01:19:04,456
You get in there and distract that guard,

1733
01:19:04,480 --> 01:19:05,549
I'm gonna get us a plane.

1734
01:19:06,280 --> 01:19:07,315
What?

1735
01:19:09,160 --> 01:19:10,760
I don't know what the hell you expect...

1736
01:19:13,080 --> 01:19:14,080
Bob!

1737
01:19:14,880 --> 01:19:15,880
Bob!

1738
01:19:16,520 --> 01:19:17,555
Fuck!

1739
01:19:18,160 --> 01:19:19,229
Fuck you, Bob!

1740
01:19:20,640 --> 01:19:21,640
Damn it!

1741
01:19:29,720 --> 01:19:32,029
Hey, I need a plane.

1742
01:19:32,240 --> 01:19:35,152
Sir, you cannot be in here.
This is a private airfield.

1743
01:19:35,320 --> 01:19:37,834
I understand that but I have an organ
in this cooler right now

1744
01:19:38,040 --> 01:19:40,031
that needs to get transported ASAP.

1745
01:19:40,720 --> 01:19:41,720
Really?

1746
01:19:41,920 --> 01:19:44,912
Because my sister-in-law
had a heart transplant last year

1747
01:19:45,080 --> 01:19:47,913
and they did not bring it
in a Playmate lunch cooler.

1748
01:19:48,080 --> 01:19:49,877
I hate to break it to you,

1749
01:19:50,040 --> 01:19:51,758
but this is not a...

1750
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:54,640
- This is not a heart.
- It's not a heart?

1751
01:19:55,360 --> 01:19:56,395
No, it's not.

1752
01:19:56,600 --> 01:19:57,794
Hmm. What is it then?

1753
01:19:58,880 --> 01:20:01,030
- It's a dick.
- Okay.

1754
01:20:02,600 --> 01:20:04,477
I am made of questions right now.

1755
01:20:04,640 --> 01:20:05,914
Well, you don't have to ask.

1756
01:20:06,080 --> 01:20:07,877
Last night, lady got into it with a man.

1757
01:20:08,040 --> 01:20:09,712
She ended up cutting his pecker off.

1758
01:20:09,880 --> 01:20:11,757
She left with it, got in a car, drove,

1759
01:20:11,920 --> 01:20:13,876
got on 95, threw it out the window.

1760
01:20:14,240 --> 01:20:17,073
<i>The second largest penis hunt
in the state history.</i>

1761
01:20:17,240 --> 01:20:18,696
The man was Korean, so you better believe

1762
01:20:18,720 --> 01:20:19,994
it took a long time to find.

1763
01:20:20,600 --> 01:20:22,477
<i>You're stereotyping Korean dicks.</i>

1764
01:20:22,640 --> 01:20:23,709
That's racist.

1765
01:20:23,920 --> 01:20:25,638
I've seen Korean dicks bigger than you.

1766
01:20:25,840 --> 01:20:28,354
Okay, after finding it,
the guy brought it to me,

1767
01:20:28,520 --> 01:20:31,496
and he said, "Do your due diligence in
getting this dick where it's got to go."

1768
01:20:31,520 --> 01:20:32,794
That's what I do.

1769
01:20:32,960 --> 01:20:35,269
I'm a dick deliverer specialist.

1770
01:20:35,720 --> 01:20:36,720
Oh, DDS?

1771
01:20:36,960 --> 01:20:38,552
Like a dentist but for dicks.

1772
01:20:39,320 --> 01:20:40,320
Uh...

1773
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:43,798
So, people are like,
"Here's a dick. Find a plane."

1774
01:20:44,640 --> 01:20:46,710
That's how you do it?
You're like an Uber for dicks?

1775
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:48,680
Where do you get these jobs?
On Craigslist?

1776
01:20:48,840 --> 01:20:50,840
Okay, sir, we don't need
to demean each other here.

1777
01:20:50,920 --> 01:20:52,400
I don't believe a word you're saying.

1778
01:20:52,920 --> 01:20:54,194
<i>Let me see it.</i>

1779
01:20:54,800 --> 01:20:56,552
I have no problem showing you this.

1780
01:20:56,720 --> 01:20:59,154
So if you wanna see it
then get ready to see.

1781
01:20:59,520 --> 01:21:01,431
- Here I go.
- Go for it.

1782
01:21:02,760 --> 01:21:05,593
Oh, shit! Oh, shit.

1783
01:21:05,760 --> 01:21:08,194
I'm just kidding. This is my friend.

1784
01:21:08,560 --> 01:21:10,232
- Oh!
- It's my buddy.

1785
01:21:10,480 --> 01:21:12,277
His name's Snake Gyllenhaal.

1786
01:21:12,480 --> 01:21:14,471
- He guards my lunch.
- Okay, that's enough.

1787
01:21:38,200 --> 01:21:39,599
It's gotta be Harris, right?

1788
01:21:40,880 --> 01:21:41,915
What do you mean?

1789
01:21:42,120 --> 01:21:43,720
I mean, she's gotta be The Black Badger.

1790
01:21:43,800 --> 01:21:45,096
It's the only thing that makes sense.

1791
01:21:45,120 --> 01:21:47,000
I mean, she's had access
to the encryption codes

1792
01:21:47,040 --> 01:21:49,720
and she's so hot and bothered about
pinning this whole thing on you.

1793
01:21:49,880 --> 01:21:50,949
It's gotta be her!

1794
01:21:51,120 --> 01:21:52,633
I don't know, Jet.

1795
01:21:52,840 --> 01:21:54,720
I'm pretty sure she thinks
I'm The Black Badger.

1796
01:21:54,880 --> 01:21:57,056
She worked me over pretty good
in that interrogation room.

1797
01:21:57,080 --> 01:21:59,496
Hold on, wait, wait... What's going on?

1798
01:21:59,520 --> 01:22:01,954
<i>What's that?
What's going on right now, Bob?</i>

1799
01:22:02,120 --> 01:22:04,401
No biggie. We're completely outta gas.

1800
01:22:04,480 --> 01:22:05,959
Oh, my... Oh!

1801
01:22:07,920 --> 01:22:10,195
We're going down, Jet!
There's nothing I can do!

1802
01:22:10,400 --> 01:22:12,994
- Oh, shit!
- Really quickly...

1803
01:22:13,160 --> 01:22:16,755
What's the one thing
you wish you'd done in your life?

1804
01:22:16,920 --> 01:22:19,416
The one thing I wish I hadn't done
is not get in a plane with a guy

1805
01:22:19,440 --> 01:22:21,351
who didn't check the goddamned fuel!

1806
01:22:21,520 --> 01:22:24,478
- Why wouldn't you check the fuel?
- No, something that's real.

1807
01:22:24,640 --> 01:22:27,074
What's the one thing
you regret not doing for you?

1808
01:22:27,240 --> 01:22:29,390
Oh, my God! I think we're gonna die!

1809
01:22:34,120 --> 01:22:36,076
Not having a kid, man!

1810
01:22:36,600 --> 01:22:37,794
<i>Not being a father!</i>

1811
01:22:37,960 --> 01:22:40,315
I regret not being a father!

1812
01:22:40,480 --> 01:22:42,357
<i>Maggie, I should've gave you a kid!</i>

1813
01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:44,994
I should've gave you my seed, Maggie!

1814
01:22:45,160 --> 01:22:46,559
I should've!

1815
01:22:46,720 --> 01:22:48,073
<i>I'm so selfish!</i>

1816
01:22:49,480 --> 01:22:51,471
<i>I'm sorry, Maggie!</i>

1817
01:22:55,640 --> 01:22:57,915
- That wasn't so hard, right?
- What?

1818
01:22:58,080 --> 01:22:59,798
Hey, just for the record,

1819
01:22:59,960 --> 01:23:01,632
I think you'd make a great dad.

1820
01:23:02,280 --> 01:23:04,077
Did you just fake this whole thing?

1821
01:23:04,760 --> 01:23:05,760
Yeah, kinda.

1822
01:23:05,920 --> 01:23:07,558
You gotta be shitting me glory!

1823
01:23:07,720 --> 01:23:09,199
No, not at all.

1824
01:23:09,360 --> 01:23:11,576
I just thought that maybe a
facing-your-own-death situation

1825
01:23:11,600 --> 01:23:14,672
might help motivate you
to clarify some of your goals in life.

1826
01:23:14,880 --> 01:23:16,393
And, hey, between me and you,

1827
01:23:16,880 --> 01:23:18,560
I know you've been struggling
a little bit.

1828
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:21,195
You know what I'm struggling with
right now, Bob?

1829
01:23:21,360 --> 01:23:22,839
Not whooping your ass.

1830
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:25,216
Okay, Jet.
Hey, you're really cute when you cry.

1831
01:23:25,240 --> 01:23:27,151
Stop it! Enough!

1832
01:23:40,800 --> 01:23:41,994
I don't get it.

1833
01:23:42,200 --> 01:23:43,376
I mean, if these coordinates are correct,

1834
01:23:43,400 --> 01:23:45,470
we should be standing right on top of it.

1835
01:23:45,640 --> 01:23:48,518
The deal doesn't go down
for another 30 minutes, Jet,

1836
01:23:48,680 --> 01:23:51,194
- so we're kinda early.
- No!

1837
01:23:51,360 --> 01:23:52,896
Why would you do it
out in the open like this?

1838
01:23:52,920 --> 01:23:54,433
Why would you take that risk?

1839
01:23:54,600 --> 01:23:56,272
Just doesn't make any sense, man.

1840
01:23:57,600 --> 01:23:59,272
Shit! Come on.

1841
01:24:01,320 --> 01:24:02,355
Wait.

1842
01:24:04,040 --> 01:24:05,917
Oh, wait.
It's not happening up here.

1843
01:24:07,720 --> 01:24:09,119
No, it's not. It's...

1844
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,560
Oh, it's happening beneath us. Look.

1845
01:24:14,720 --> 01:24:16,597
<i>It's an underground parking garage.</i>

1846
01:24:17,520 --> 01:24:18,953
Yeah, that's a good eye, Jet.

1847
01:24:19,480 --> 01:24:21,710
Why don't you stay up here?
Keep overwatch.

1848
01:24:21,880 --> 01:24:23,480
I'll go down there and check things out.

1849
01:24:23,520 --> 01:24:25,351
Wait, what? No, I'm going with you.

1850
01:24:25,520 --> 01:24:28,273
You can't go with me.
The smarter play is if we split up.

1851
01:24:28,440 --> 01:24:29,634
Smarter play for who?

1852
01:24:30,080 --> 01:24:31,896
Do you know what happens
when people split up, Bob?

1853
01:24:31,920 --> 01:24:32,955
Somebody dies!

1854
01:24:33,120 --> 01:24:34,560
I'd be the one to die. You know why?

1855
01:24:34,680 --> 01:24:37,160
Because I don't have a bulletproof vest
and I don't have a gun!

1856
01:24:37,240 --> 01:24:39,000
Which means that you
are my bulletproof vest!

1857
01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:41,576
My little black ass is gonna stay
behind you, you're not leaving me!

1858
01:24:41,600 --> 01:24:43,477
That's exactly why
you should stay up here.

1859
01:24:43,680 --> 01:24:46,136
Look, if you went down
in that garage and you got shot to death,

1860
01:24:46,160 --> 01:24:47,320
you know how hurt I would be?

1861
01:24:47,480 --> 01:24:49,160
I'd be super bummed out!
I don't want that.

1862
01:24:49,280 --> 01:24:50,872
It's safer for you up here.

1863
01:24:51,040 --> 01:24:53,056
If something happened up here,
what am I supposed to do, Bob?

1864
01:24:53,080 --> 01:24:55,196
How do I get your attention?
Make a bird call?

1865
01:24:57,520 --> 01:24:59,590
Does that sound like a bird to you? Huh?

1866
01:24:59,760 --> 01:25:01,776
That's my biggest weakness!
I can't make bird noises.

1867
01:25:01,800 --> 01:25:02,835
I never could.

1868
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:04,752
So if that's what
I gotta depend on to live,

1869
01:25:04,920 --> 01:25:07,753
it means I'm gonna die!
I'mma die up here, by myself

1870
01:25:07,920 --> 01:25:10,229
sounding like a dead-ass pigeon.

1871
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,594
- I have no idea what a pigeon...
- Jet, Jet, Jet, Jet, Jet!

1872
01:25:14,760 --> 01:25:16,432
You don't have to make bird noises.

1873
01:25:16,600 --> 01:25:17,736
You don't have to sound like a pigeon.

1874
01:25:17,760 --> 01:25:20,593
All you gotta do
is call me on the encrypted phone

1875
01:25:20,800 --> 01:25:22,597
that's in your hand.

1876
01:25:27,200 --> 01:25:28,553
- Okay?
- Okay, yeah.

1877
01:25:29,040 --> 01:25:30,393
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

1878
01:25:30,600 --> 01:25:31,749
All right?

1879
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:33,194
Oh, Jet.

1880
01:25:34,720 --> 01:25:36,392
I'll see you on the other side.

1881
01:25:37,240 --> 01:25:38,240
Yeah.

1882
01:25:38,560 --> 01:25:39,560
<i>Yeah.</i>

1883
01:26:05,720 --> 01:26:06,789
You're early.

1884
01:26:07,480 --> 01:26:09,072
So are you.

1885
01:26:11,720 --> 01:26:13,073
Come on.

1886
01:26:23,760 --> 01:26:25,079
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

1887
01:26:28,920 --> 01:26:30,797
Oh, my God.

1888
01:26:31,640 --> 01:26:32,640
<i>I knew it.</i>

1889
01:26:32,800 --> 01:26:35,155
I knew it. I knew
she was The Black Badger!

1890
01:26:35,320 --> 01:26:36,958
Oh, my God!

1891
01:26:37,480 --> 01:26:39,600
Pick up the phone. Pick up the phone.

1892
01:26:39,760 --> 01:26:40,760
<i>Yello?</i>

1893
01:26:40,960 --> 01:26:43,554
Bob, Harris is The Black Badger!

1894
01:26:43,760 --> 01:26:44,760
<i>Hello?</i>

1895
01:26:45,120 --> 01:26:46,519
Harris is The Black Badger!

1896
01:26:46,720 --> 01:26:47,755
<i>I can't hear you.</i>

1897
01:26:47,920 --> 01:26:49,751
Harris is The Black Badger!

1898
01:26:51,120 --> 01:26:53,634
<i>Just kidding! I'm not here.
Leave a message at the beep.</i>

1899
01:26:53,800 --> 01:26:54,920
What?

1900
01:27:05,120 --> 01:27:06,633
Oh. Harris is
The Black Badger!

1901
01:27:06,800 --> 01:27:08,438
Harris is The Black Badger!

1902
01:27:08,600 --> 01:27:10,909
I knew it. I knew it.
Harris is The Black Badger!

1903
01:27:12,120 --> 01:27:14,236
Bob! Harris is The...

1904
01:27:15,720 --> 01:27:16,720
Who is he?

1905
01:27:17,160 --> 01:27:18,160
That's my partner.

1906
01:27:32,040 --> 01:27:33,598
I don't like splitting my fees.

1907
01:27:35,280 --> 01:27:38,431
The package. Please.

1908
01:27:39,600 --> 01:27:41,238
Thought you'd never ask.

1909
01:27:41,480 --> 01:27:44,870
Wait! You're making a mistake.

1910
01:27:46,440 --> 01:27:48,112
Hello, Bob.

1911
01:27:49,800 --> 01:27:51,392
But you're dead.

1912
01:27:51,560 --> 01:27:53,596
Not as much as people think.

1913
01:27:54,360 --> 01:27:57,113
Look, he's not The Black Badger...

1914
01:27:57,800 --> 01:27:58,800
I am.

1915
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:01,116
And those aren't the encryption codes,

1916
01:28:01,280 --> 01:28:02,599
these are.

1917
01:28:02,760 --> 01:28:03,875
He's lying to you.

1918
01:28:04,040 --> 01:28:05,519
This man is a CIA agent,

1919
01:28:05,880 --> 01:28:07,480
and he's trying to sell you bogus plans.

1920
01:28:14,720 --> 01:28:15,755
Damn.

1921
01:28:17,720 --> 01:28:19,039
Ow, ow.

1922
01:28:22,640 --> 01:28:23,709
He shot me.

1923
01:28:27,640 --> 01:28:29,790
These are the real codes

1924
01:28:30,640 --> 01:28:32,232
and I am the real Black Badger.

1925
01:28:36,360 --> 01:28:37,839
Bob is The Black Badger.

1926
01:28:39,520 --> 01:28:40,816
Bob is The Black Badger.

1927
01:28:40,840 --> 01:28:42,910
I am The Black Badger.

1928
01:28:43,400 --> 01:28:44,594
Phil?

1929
01:28:45,840 --> 01:28:48,400
No, I'm The Black Badger.

1930
01:28:48,560 --> 01:28:51,552
I'm starting to think
I might be The Black Badger.

1931
01:28:53,800 --> 01:28:55,438
Here's the thing.

1932
01:28:55,640 --> 01:28:58,712
I have no idea
who is the real Black Badger.

1933
01:28:59,760 --> 01:29:01,273
And I don't care.

1934
01:29:01,480 --> 01:29:02,959
'Cause I'm The Honey Badger.

1935
01:29:03,120 --> 01:29:05,031
And The Honey Badger doesn't give a shit.

1936
01:29:05,200 --> 01:29:06,792
The Honey Badger's nasty.

1937
01:29:06,960 --> 01:29:09,633
He's so nasty, he'll take them both.

1938
01:29:10,160 --> 01:29:11,480
Hand them over.

1939
01:29:11,720 --> 01:29:13,915
Phil, when this thing is over,

1940
01:29:14,080 --> 01:29:18,119
I'm going to rip your throat out
like Patrick Swayze in <i>Road House.</i>

1941
01:29:18,280 --> 01:29:19,760
Oh, my God. You and Road House.

1942
01:29:19,800 --> 01:29:20,835
Get over that movie.

1943
01:29:21,040 --> 01:29:22,758
It sucked then, it sucks now.

1944
01:29:23,280 --> 01:29:24,599
Fuck Patrick Swayze!

1945
01:29:25,600 --> 01:29:26,715
How dare you!

1946
01:29:32,040 --> 01:29:33,439
Drop your weapons!

1947
01:29:39,200 --> 01:29:40,235
Oh! Oh, shit!

1948
01:29:52,560 --> 01:29:53,709
The codes.

1949
01:29:54,120 --> 01:29:55,235
Don't do it.

1950
01:29:55,880 --> 01:29:56,949
Stupid.

1951
01:29:59,400 --> 01:30:00,400
Okay.

1952
01:30:00,960 --> 01:30:01,995
One,

1953
01:30:03,040 --> 01:30:04,040
two,

1954
01:30:05,400 --> 01:30:06,400
three! Shit!

1955
01:30:11,720 --> 01:30:13,392
Uh-oh! Oh!

1956
01:30:13,920 --> 01:30:14,920
No!

1957
01:30:15,400 --> 01:30:16,515
He's got the codes!

1958
01:30:51,520 --> 01:30:52,520
Whoo!

1959
01:30:52,960 --> 01:30:54,598
I mean, this is crazy, right?

1960
01:30:54,960 --> 01:30:56,256
You stay the hell away from me, Bob!

1961
01:30:56,280 --> 01:30:57,554
<i>You shot me in the neck!</i>

1962
01:31:00,600 --> 01:31:01,600
Jet!

1963
01:31:22,880 --> 01:31:23,915
Okay.

1964
01:31:28,320 --> 01:31:30,470
Golden Jet for the win!

1965
01:31:32,120 --> 01:31:33,633
No. Shit!

1966
01:31:33,840 --> 01:31:35,193
Drop your weapon, Bob.

1967
01:31:36,400 --> 01:31:37,400
Oh, shit!

1968
01:31:37,560 --> 01:31:39,118
Get behind me, Mr. Joyner.

1969
01:31:39,560 --> 01:31:40,913
Ah, you don't wanna do that, Jet.

1970
01:31:41,160 --> 01:31:42,434
It's obvious he's the bad guy.

1971
01:31:42,640 --> 01:31:44,216
I'm the good guy. You wanna get behind me.

1972
01:31:44,240 --> 01:31:46,071
Agent Harris had me go dark

1973
01:31:46,240 --> 01:31:49,312
to get Bob to reveal himself
as The Black Badger.

1974
01:31:49,520 --> 01:31:51,256
You don't seriously
believe this guy, do you?

1975
01:31:51,280 --> 01:31:52,440
You wanna get behind me, Jet.

1976
01:31:52,600 --> 01:31:54,318
You betrayed your nation, Bob.

1977
01:31:54,680 --> 01:31:56,989
You betrayed your partner, Phil.

1978
01:31:57,160 --> 01:32:00,516
Okay, no, wait! Everybody just stop!

1979
01:32:00,680 --> 01:32:01,715
Cut the shit!

1980
01:32:02,280 --> 01:32:03,918
I'mma cut the line right now!

1981
01:32:04,120 --> 01:32:05,473
I cut the shit!

1982
01:32:05,640 --> 01:32:07,517
Hear me? Now I don't care
who betrayed who.

1983
01:32:07,680 --> 01:32:09,113
Okay? I just don't wanna get hurt!

1984
01:32:09,560 --> 01:32:12,074
So there ain't gonna be no... Shit!

1985
01:32:20,960 --> 01:32:21,960
Come on.

1986
01:32:37,840 --> 01:32:38,840
Shi...

1987
01:32:43,520 --> 01:32:44,520
Shit.

1988
01:33:03,240 --> 01:33:05,310
Smart move, Mr. Joyner.

1989
01:33:05,480 --> 01:33:07,755
You've done your country a great service.

1990
01:33:07,920 --> 01:33:10,115
Now, hand me the firearm

1991
01:33:10,280 --> 01:33:13,511
and we'll turn over
the satellite codes together.

1992
01:33:13,920 --> 01:33:17,515
Stay right there, man.
Don't you take another step.

1993
01:33:17,760 --> 01:33:20,069
Just because I shot him
does not mean I trust you.

1994
01:33:20,480 --> 01:33:21,629
We don't have time for this.

1995
01:33:21,840 --> 01:33:24,593
Stop! I said, "Stop."

1996
01:33:25,360 --> 01:33:27,112
Aw, whoopsie.

1997
01:33:31,320 --> 01:33:33,356
Nice throw, bitch.

1998
01:33:38,080 --> 01:33:42,596
You wanna know why your pal Bob
could never have been The Black Badger?

1999
01:33:43,760 --> 01:33:45,876
It's because he's too weak.

2000
01:33:46,040 --> 01:33:48,349
And if I had to hear
another goddamned story

2001
01:33:48,520 --> 01:33:51,717
about Calvin "The Golden Jet" Joyner

2002
01:33:51,880 --> 01:33:54,030
and how awesome you were in high school

2003
01:33:54,200 --> 01:33:56,794
and how you were
this big idiot's best friend,

2004
01:33:56,960 --> 01:33:58,473
I was just gonna lose it.

2005
01:33:59,760 --> 01:34:03,070
Looking at you right now,
you don't seem so cool.

2006
01:34:03,280 --> 01:34:06,716
You just seem like a regular guy.

2007
01:34:07,160 --> 01:34:08,593
An everyday Joe.

2008
01:34:09,480 --> 01:34:13,075
You know, faking my own death
was the easy part.

2009
01:34:13,960 --> 01:34:17,236
<i>But dealing with Bob, day after day,
was the hard part.</i>

2010
01:34:17,400 --> 01:34:18,400
Hey, Phil.

2011
01:34:18,560 --> 01:34:19,629
What, Bob?

2012
01:34:20,560 --> 01:34:22,391
I'll see you on the other side.

2013
01:34:23,080 --> 01:34:25,389
No, I hope we don't. All right?

2014
01:34:25,560 --> 01:34:27,118
Just, no. Bye, bye, bye.

2015
01:34:27,280 --> 01:34:28,280
Just go.

2016
01:34:28,440 --> 01:34:31,159
<i>I made up the Black Badger,
rigged up a blood bag</i>

2017
01:34:31,320 --> 01:34:32,480
<i>and that big dummy bought it.</i>

2018
01:34:32,640 --> 01:34:33,789
Bob!

2019
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:35,911
No, no! Hang on, buddy.

2020
01:34:36,520 --> 01:34:38,040
No, there's some sort of bomb in here.

2021
01:34:38,080 --> 01:34:39,957
You're pushing it closed, I think.

2022
01:34:40,120 --> 01:34:42,190
- No, no, no. Sorry.
- No, don't give up!

2023
01:34:42,400 --> 01:34:43,400
Bye, Bob.

2024
01:34:44,440 --> 01:34:46,749
<i>I'm getting away with
a half a billion dollars.</i>

2025
01:34:46,920 --> 01:34:50,356
<i>And Boy Scout Bob is gonna
spend his life in prison.</i>

2026
01:34:50,520 --> 01:34:52,112
<i>Ain't America great?</i>

2027
01:34:52,920 --> 01:34:57,436
So now you're gonna be
the second partner of Bob's to die.

2028
01:34:57,600 --> 01:34:58,600
Just relax.

2029
01:34:58,760 --> 01:35:01,354
On your knees, Golden Jet.

2030
01:35:11,080 --> 01:35:12,274
What the hell was that?

2031
01:35:14,120 --> 01:35:15,758
Golden Jet flip.

2032
01:35:16,280 --> 01:35:19,192
Yeah? Well, you really suck at it.

2033
01:35:19,400 --> 01:35:20,628
I know.

2034
01:35:20,800 --> 01:35:22,472
Then why'd you do it?

2035
01:35:22,640 --> 01:35:23,640
Distraction.

2036
01:35:27,680 --> 01:35:29,080
Oh, you just pulled his throat out!

2037
01:35:31,480 --> 01:35:33,198
I'll see you on the other side.

2038
01:35:38,320 --> 01:35:40,056
Jet, come here.
Give me your hand, old buddy.

2039
01:35:40,080 --> 01:35:41,798
Oh, shit! Get that away from me!

2040
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:43,149
Sorry, Jet.

2041
01:35:44,200 --> 01:35:46,475
Come here, Jet.
That was a trachea.

2042
01:35:46,640 --> 01:35:48,153
Great distraction, man!

2043
01:35:48,320 --> 01:35:49,753
<i>Sorry I had to shoot you, Jet.</i>

2044
01:35:49,920 --> 01:35:51,638
<i>It was the only way
I could save your life.</i>

2045
01:35:51,800 --> 01:35:53,995
But when you shot me
to get Phil to confess

2046
01:35:54,160 --> 01:35:55,479
that he was The Black Badger,

2047
01:35:55,680 --> 01:35:57,636
<i>that was some next-level-type shit!</i>

2048
01:35:57,800 --> 01:36:01,554
Yeah, no.
I'm glad you see it the way I saw it.

2049
01:36:01,720 --> 01:36:03,676
That was my plan the whole time. So...

2050
01:36:03,840 --> 01:36:05,512
<i>You are a natural for this line of work.</i>

2051
01:36:05,680 --> 01:36:07,176
I mean, you're smart,
you got the skill set,

2052
01:36:07,200 --> 01:36:08,235
you're a people person

2053
01:36:08,400 --> 01:36:11,676
and you already got a dope-ass code name,
"The Golden Jet!" What?

2054
01:36:11,840 --> 01:36:13,736
<i>But in the meantime,
we gotta get those encryption codes</i>

2055
01:36:13,760 --> 01:36:15,680
over to Harris right away
or we're gonna be late.

2056
01:36:15,840 --> 01:36:18,195
What are you talking about? Late for what?

2057
01:36:20,200 --> 01:36:25,115
The reunion, dude. What-what!
This shit's on!

2058
01:36:27,080 --> 01:36:29,036
Bob. Damn it.

2059
01:36:52,560 --> 01:36:53,560
Bob!

2060
01:36:53,720 --> 01:36:54,720
One more thing.

2061
01:36:54,880 --> 01:36:56,480
Thanks for securing the satellite codes.

2062
01:36:56,640 --> 01:36:58,153
You really saved my ass.

2063
01:36:58,320 --> 01:36:59,389
Your country thanks you.

2064
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:01,000
Just doing my job.

2065
01:37:01,040 --> 01:37:03,918
I'm really sorry about your hand.
I hope you know that wasn't personal.

2066
01:37:04,080 --> 01:37:05,800
Oh, no hard feelings at all, Pam.

2067
01:37:06,200 --> 01:37:07,679
Besides, everybody makes mistakes.

2068
01:37:07,880 --> 01:37:09,871
Calvin, here, thought
you were The Black Badger.

2069
01:37:11,840 --> 01:37:13,080
I don't... No, I don't think...

2070
01:37:13,120 --> 01:37:15,616
When we were in the plane,
you said, "Hey, Harris is the Black..."

2071
01:37:15,640 --> 01:37:17,520
I think you should... Maybe I...

2072
01:37:17,800 --> 01:37:20,553
Mr. Joyner, it was a pleasure
working with you.

2073
01:37:20,720 --> 01:37:23,439
If you ever want a career change,
you give me a call.

2074
01:37:24,160 --> 01:37:26,496
If I were to give you a call,
how would I get in touch with you?

2075
01:37:26,520 --> 01:37:28,351
Just pick up any phone in your house.

2076
01:37:28,520 --> 01:37:29,635
They're all bugged.

2077
01:37:31,320 --> 01:37:33,038
You're crazy. Hey, you're crazy!

2078
01:37:33,600 --> 01:37:35,511
That's a good one.

2079
01:37:35,680 --> 01:37:38,114
Calvin! I got your text
and came right over.

2080
01:37:38,280 --> 01:37:41,397
Where the hell have you been?
Why did you get out of a helicopter?

2081
01:37:41,840 --> 01:37:43,398
Hey, uh, Maggie.

2082
01:37:43,560 --> 01:37:44,675
Uh, hi!

2083
01:37:45,120 --> 01:37:46,712
Babe, why is Dr. Dan with you?

2084
01:37:47,120 --> 01:37:48,155
Well... Uh...

2085
01:37:48,520 --> 01:37:49,873
That's not Dr. Dan.

2086
01:37:50,040 --> 01:37:52,315
Allow me to properly introduce myself.

2087
01:37:52,480 --> 01:37:53,629
My name is Bob Stone,

2088
01:37:54,200 --> 01:37:56,873
the artist formerly known as
Robbie Wheirdicht.

2089
01:37:57,040 --> 01:37:58,075
I work for the CIA.

2090
01:37:58,240 --> 01:38:00,376
I roped your husband
into helping me track down a traitor,

2091
01:38:00,400 --> 01:38:03,198
who was gonna sell
military state secrets to a terrorist.

2092
01:38:03,360 --> 01:38:04,918
We did all that, we stopped them,

2093
01:38:05,080 --> 01:38:07,196
we saved the free world, and here we are.

2094
01:38:09,040 --> 01:38:10,393
What the hell is going on?

2095
01:38:10,560 --> 01:38:12,198
Okay, listen, listen.

2096
01:38:12,400 --> 01:38:14,391
I've been a fool. All right?

2097
01:38:14,560 --> 01:38:16,551
I thought that my life was a failure.

2098
01:38:16,720 --> 01:38:19,029
I thought that it wasn't special.
But it is special.

2099
01:38:19,240 --> 01:38:21,071
It's special because I have you in it.

2100
01:38:21,240 --> 01:38:24,391
You are my world.
You are what makes me special!

2101
01:38:24,960 --> 01:38:27,110
You're everything to me, Mags.

2102
01:38:27,280 --> 01:38:28,554
I love you.

2103
01:38:29,240 --> 01:38:30,389
I love you.

2104
01:38:35,080 --> 01:38:36,080
<i>Okay.</i>

2105
01:38:37,240 --> 01:38:39,071
Here come the waterworks.

2106
01:38:39,240 --> 01:38:41,231
<i>I promised myself I wouldn't do this.</i>

2107
01:38:43,920 --> 01:38:45,751
- Come on, come on.
- Okay.

2108
01:38:48,720 --> 01:38:50,438
- That's Robbie Wheirdicht?
- Yeah.

2109
01:39:12,800 --> 01:39:13,994
- Hi, Brian.
- Hi, Gail.

2110
01:39:14,160 --> 01:39:16,276
Guys, this isn't a good idea.
You know what?

2111
01:39:16,440 --> 01:39:18,749
I'll just meet you later.
I shouldn't have come.

2112
01:39:18,920 --> 01:39:19,920
Wait, wait, wait.

2113
01:39:20,080 --> 01:39:23,117
Bob, calm down, okay? Listen to me.

2114
01:39:23,280 --> 01:39:25,776
Tonight is not gonna be
how high school was for you 20 years ago.

2115
01:39:25,800 --> 01:39:26,994
I promise.

2116
01:39:27,160 --> 01:39:29,628
<i>Attention,</i> por favor.

2117
01:39:29,840 --> 01:39:30,989
<i>And now,</i>

2118
01:39:31,160 --> 01:39:33,799
<i>for the moment
you've all been waiting for,</i>

2119
01:39:33,960 --> 01:39:38,511
<i>tonight's vote for the reunion
homecoming king and queen!</i>

2120
01:39:38,680 --> 01:39:40,352
<i>We'll announce the queen in one moment.</i>

2121
01:39:40,520 --> 01:39:42,954
<i>But first, without further ado...</i>

2122
01:39:43,480 --> 01:39:45,311
<i>The new homecoming king</i>

2123
01:39:45,480 --> 01:39:49,155
<i>for the Central High School Centaurs,
Class of 1996 is...</i>

2124
01:39:49,480 --> 01:39:50,674
I really gotta pee, Jet.

2125
01:39:50,840 --> 01:39:52,319
<i>Bob Stone!</i>

2126
01:39:54,840 --> 01:39:56,398
<i>Do we have a Bob Stone?</i>

2127
01:39:56,560 --> 01:39:58,869
Here he is, Bob Stone, huh!

2128
01:39:59,600 --> 01:40:00,760
<i>Yeah!</i>

2129
01:40:01,920 --> 01:40:03,876
Go on, get your rock-hard ass up there.

2130
01:40:04,600 --> 01:40:05,600
For reals?

2131
01:40:05,760 --> 01:40:07,910
For reals, for reals. Go ahead, man.

2132
01:40:08,520 --> 01:40:09,520
Whoo!

2133
01:40:09,760 --> 01:40:11,273
You did it, big guy!

2134
01:40:17,280 --> 01:40:20,352
How did Bob Stone win homecoming king?

2135
01:40:20,640 --> 01:40:22,915
I hacked into the votes on the flight in.

2136
01:40:23,120 --> 01:40:26,078
Calvin Joyner, forensic accountant,
at your service.

2137
01:40:27,440 --> 01:40:29,749
I had no idea you could do that.

2138
01:40:30,520 --> 01:40:33,637
There's a lot of things
that you don't know about me, Maggie.

2139
01:40:34,240 --> 01:40:35,400
No, scratch that I said that.

2140
01:40:35,560 --> 01:40:37,256
It was supposed to
come out cool. It didn't.

2141
01:40:37,280 --> 01:40:38,656
It was something I thought of,
it was like a...

2142
01:40:38,680 --> 01:40:39,715
Forget it.

2143
01:40:41,120 --> 01:40:42,951
Well, well, let's hear it for him!

2144
01:40:43,120 --> 01:40:44,599
Fat Robbie made good.

2145
01:40:44,760 --> 01:40:48,036
King Robbie Weird Dick, our naked mascot.

2146
01:40:48,680 --> 01:40:50,376
Why don't you just
get out of the way, Trevor?

2147
01:40:50,400 --> 01:40:51,719
Or what, Golden Jet?

2148
01:40:51,880 --> 01:40:53,256
You're gonna hop up here
and punch me in the belt?

2149
01:40:53,280 --> 01:40:54,395
Simmer down, Ant-Man.

2150
01:40:54,560 --> 01:40:56,790
- You know what? That's it. That's it.
- It's okay.

2151
01:40:56,960 --> 01:40:58,136
- It's all right.
- No, I've had it!

2152
01:40:58,160 --> 01:40:59,752
- I got it, Jet. It's okay.
- It's okay.

2153
01:40:59,920 --> 01:41:01,035
I'll handle it.

2154
01:41:01,320 --> 01:41:05,233
Whoa, whoa! Hang on. I'm not buying
this whole transformation

2155
01:41:05,400 --> 01:41:06,992
from ugly duckling into swan.

2156
01:41:07,200 --> 01:41:08,200
No one in here is.

2157
01:41:08,360 --> 01:41:11,796
You can fly in, in a bunch of helicopters
and dress up in a thousand suits,

2158
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:15,595
but to everybody, including me,
you'll always just be the fat kid.

2159
01:41:18,880 --> 01:41:20,600
I've been thinking
about this a lot, Trevor.

2160
01:41:21,520 --> 01:41:23,112
And the only thing I want to say to you

2161
01:41:23,760 --> 01:41:24,760
is I forgive you.

2162
01:41:25,320 --> 01:41:27,834
You forgive me! Oh, boy! For what?

2163
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:29,513
For being rad as shit.

2164
01:41:29,680 --> 01:41:30,874
Fuck you, fat boy.

2165
01:41:31,080 --> 01:41:32,560
Still a scared little bitch.

2166
01:41:36,800 --> 01:41:37,994
I don't like bullies.

2167
01:41:41,800 --> 01:41:44,030
And the name is Bob Stone, bitch!

2168
01:41:44,360 --> 01:41:45,360
Whoo-whoo!

2169
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:47,399
Come on, baby. Step over.

2170
01:41:51,360 --> 01:41:52,509
<i>Hi, everybody!</i>

2171
01:41:53,480 --> 01:41:56,950
<i>Most of you knew me back in high school as</i>

2172
01:41:57,920 --> 01:41:59,399
<i>Robbie Wheirdicht.</i>

2173
01:41:59,600 --> 01:42:01,511
<i>- That's Robbie Wheirdicht?
- No way!</i>

2174
01:42:01,680 --> 01:42:03,716
<i>I wore prescription pants every day.</i>

2175
01:42:05,800 --> 01:42:08,030
<i>Twenty years ago, in this gym,</i>

2176
01:42:09,240 --> 01:42:11,196
<i>I stood in front of you all</i>

2177
01:42:12,040 --> 01:42:13,155
<i>naked</i>

2178
01:42:13,880 --> 01:42:15,279
<i>and embarrassed.</i>

2179
01:42:16,240 --> 01:42:18,151
<i>Some of you might remember that day.</i>

2180
01:42:19,360 --> 01:42:21,476
<i>A lot of you probably even laughed.</i>

2181
01:42:22,480 --> 01:42:24,118
<i>But that's okay.</i>

2182
01:42:25,240 --> 01:42:27,834
<i>Tonight's gonna be different because</i>

2183
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:31,072
<i>my best friend is here with me.</i>

2184
01:42:33,240 --> 01:42:38,394
<i>And he taught me what it means
to be the hero of your own story.</i>

2185
01:42:41,160 --> 01:42:42,560
<i>Would you hold this for me, please?</i>

2186
01:42:44,240 --> 01:42:46,151
<i>Being the hero of your own story</i>

2187
01:42:46,320 --> 01:42:50,677
<i>isn't about stopping bad guys
or climbing mountains.</i>

2188
01:42:50,840 --> 01:42:53,957
<i>It's about overcoming bullies
in your life,</i>

2189
01:42:54,120 --> 01:42:57,032
<i>whatever or whomever they may be.</i>

2190
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:00,673
<i>It's about putting it all out there</i>

2191
01:43:01,360 --> 01:43:02,395
<i>for everyone</i>

2192
01:43:03,760 --> 01:43:04,909
<i>to see.</i>

2193
01:43:05,760 --> 01:43:07,591
<i>And it's realizing that, in life,</i>

2194
01:43:07,760 --> 01:43:10,115
<i>the most important thing that you can be</i>

2195
01:43:11,240 --> 01:43:12,309
<i>is yourself.</i>

2196
01:43:13,080 --> 01:43:17,392
<i>So, Central High, Class of 1996,</i>

2197
01:43:18,360 --> 01:43:21,238
<i>this is me, Robbie Wheirdicht.</i>

2198
01:43:32,520 --> 01:43:35,114
Oh, my God! Bob just went commando!

2199
01:43:36,960 --> 01:43:38,552
Yes! Yes!

2200
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:44,592
<i>Way to go, Bob!</i>

2201
01:43:45,480 --> 01:43:46,708
<i>Be you!</i>

2202
01:43:47,240 --> 01:43:49,310
Robbie!
Robbie! Robbie!

2203
01:43:49,480 --> 01:43:52,472
<i>Robbie! Robbie! Robbie!</i>

2204
01:43:58,000 --> 01:43:59,149
Hey, man!

2205
01:43:59,320 --> 01:44:01,515
Dude, this is amazing!
I'm so happy for you!

2206
01:44:01,680 --> 01:44:03,398
Thank you, Jet! I feel so free!

2207
01:44:03,920 --> 01:44:04,955
- Come here.
- No, no, no.

2208
01:44:05,120 --> 01:44:06,872
Your junk is out.

2209
01:44:07,240 --> 01:44:09,800
- Oh. Sorry, Jet.
- Excuse me.

2210
01:44:12,240 --> 01:44:13,593
Hi, Robbie.

2211
01:44:14,680 --> 01:44:16,750
- You probably don't remember me.
- Darla.

2212
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:20,036
- Is that Darla McGuckian?
- Yeah.

2213
01:44:20,200 --> 01:44:22,475
Wow! She looks great!

2214
01:44:22,840 --> 01:44:24,240
Didn't she used to have a lazy eye?

2215
01:44:24,400 --> 01:44:25,719
- Two of them.
- Wow.

2216
01:44:25,880 --> 01:44:27,950
I can't believe you remember me.

2217
01:44:28,120 --> 01:44:29,599
Remember you?

2218
01:44:29,760 --> 01:44:31,318
How could I forget you?

2219
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:35,788
You still have the same sweet smile,
the same sweet face.

2220
01:44:36,360 --> 01:44:39,193
But your hair's changed.
You used to wear it curlier.

2221
01:44:39,360 --> 01:44:40,588
I like it though.

2222
01:44:41,040 --> 01:44:42,678
You haven't changed at all.

2223
01:44:42,880 --> 01:44:44,393
Oh, I don't know.

2224
01:44:50,520 --> 01:44:52,351
You're still as beautiful as ever.

2225
01:44:52,680 --> 01:44:53,680
Oh.

2226
01:45:03,040 --> 01:45:04,758
- Yeah, Bob!
- Go, Bob!

2227
01:45:05,760 --> 01:45:07,239
No, no, no.

2228
01:45:14,480 --> 01:45:16,550
Oh, I got spinny.

2229
01:45:16,760 --> 01:45:18,557
Super spinny.

2230
01:45:21,160 --> 01:45:22,957
Yeah, that's nice.

2231
01:45:23,640 --> 01:45:26,393
- Can I take you to get ice-cream...
- Yes.

2232
01:45:27,240 --> 01:45:29,231
Yes. Yes, yes, yes.

2233
01:45:29,840 --> 01:45:32,832
Super lactose intolerant, but that's okay.
Let's roll the dice.

2234
01:45:35,840 --> 01:45:36,840
That's my jam!

2235
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:38,040
Go show them what you got.

2236
01:45:38,240 --> 01:45:40,071
- All right, Darla.
- Okay.

2237
01:45:40,400 --> 01:45:42,391
Darla, hi. Calvin.

2238
01:45:42,600 --> 01:45:44,238
Hi, Colin. Nice to meet you.

2239
01:45:44,840 --> 01:45:46,751
- Calvin.
- And Maggie.

2240
01:45:46,920 --> 01:45:48,592
Maggie, hi!

2241
01:45:48,760 --> 01:45:51,069
Hi. You look so good.

2242
01:45:51,280 --> 01:45:53,589
- My gosh, you look the same.
- You do too.

2243
01:45:53,760 --> 01:45:54,760
Oh, I don't know.

2244
01:45:54,920 --> 01:45:57,036
You probably remember me
as The Golden Jet.

2245
01:45:57,240 --> 01:45:59,834
Your name's Golden Jeff? Hi, Jeff.

2246
01:46:00,600 --> 01:46:02,272
It's okay. Good to see you.

2247
01:46:05,680 --> 01:46:08,114
- Good going, Bob!
- Come on, Bob!

2248
01:46:23,840 --> 01:46:25,353
- All right.
- Good luck!

2249
01:46:25,560 --> 01:46:26,788
- Love you.
- I love you.

2250
01:46:26,960 --> 01:46:28,837
I love you, too, little Golden Jet!

2251
01:46:31,520 --> 01:46:32,520
Mmm...

2252
01:46:32,680 --> 01:46:33,749
Okay. Uh...

2253
01:46:34,840 --> 01:46:36,398
How long do you think he's been there?

2254
01:46:37,160 --> 01:46:38,957
<i>Hmm, probably since last night.</i>

2255
01:46:39,560 --> 01:46:41,000
All right, babe, I'll see you later.

2256
01:46:41,160 --> 01:46:42,878
Have fun with your friend!

2257
01:46:48,480 --> 01:46:49,480
Who, me?

2258
01:46:49,640 --> 01:46:50,914
Yes, you.

2259
01:47:00,120 --> 01:47:01,439
Wow, Jet!

2260
01:47:01,640 --> 01:47:03,312
You look amazing!

2261
01:47:03,520 --> 01:47:05,272
- Do you think?
- Oh, what? Yes!

2262
01:47:05,480 --> 01:47:07,311
I just didn't know
the kind of look to go for

2263
01:47:07,520 --> 01:47:08,656
on my first day at the agency.

2264
01:47:08,680 --> 01:47:10,716
You look like a black Will Smith,
or something.

2265
01:47:10,920 --> 01:47:12,600
Okay, I'm not sure
if that's racist or not,

2266
01:47:12,760 --> 01:47:13,936
but I'll take it as a compliment.

2267
01:47:13,960 --> 01:47:15,359
All right, cool. Yeah, come on!

2268
01:47:15,520 --> 01:47:16,669
Okay.

2269
01:47:17,320 --> 01:47:18,514
All right. Don't be nervous.

2270
01:47:18,680 --> 01:47:20,520
You are gonna do great.
They're gonna love you!

2271
01:47:20,600 --> 01:47:21,999
Oh, Jet, Jet, Jet!

2272
01:47:22,200 --> 01:47:23,320
Um, before we go, man, uh...

2273
01:47:24,760 --> 01:47:25,875
I got a surprise for you.

2274
01:47:27,120 --> 01:47:29,031
Okay. What's the surprise?

2275
01:47:29,200 --> 01:47:31,839
Well, you gotta close your eyes first.

2276
01:47:33,520 --> 01:47:34,669
Eyes are closed.

2277
01:47:34,880 --> 01:47:35,880
No peeking.

2278
01:47:41,360 --> 01:47:42,509
Open your eyes.

2279
01:47:46,840 --> 01:47:49,195
Is that my... Is that my jacket?

2280
01:47:49,360 --> 01:47:50,395
Yes!

2281
01:47:50,560 --> 01:47:52,551
- Bob, is that my jacket?
- Yes!

2282
01:47:52,720 --> 01:47:54,153
- No, wait a minute.
- Yes!

2283
01:47:54,360 --> 01:47:56,032
Oh, my God!

2284
01:47:56,400 --> 01:47:57,656
Dude, where'd you get this from?

2285
01:47:57,680 --> 01:48:01,309
Well, I sleep in it most nights,
but it's clean now, totally good. Yeah!

2286
01:48:01,480 --> 01:48:04,074
Man! You are the man! Yes!

2287
01:48:04,240 --> 01:48:07,118
- Family hug! What?
- Ooh. Okay.

2288
01:48:09,200 --> 01:48:10,315
All right, let's go!

2289
01:48:10,480 --> 01:48:11,799
- Okay.
- All right.

2290
01:48:26,200 --> 01:48:28,156
You still ride?

2291
01:48:28,680 --> 01:48:30,910
Cut! The fire department's here.

2292
01:48:31,200 --> 01:48:33,589
All right. That's our cue, guys!

2293
01:48:34,520 --> 01:48:36,400
Here we are
shooting <i>Central Intelligence.</i>

2294
01:48:36,440 --> 01:48:38,351
They shut us down.
The fire trucks are out here.

2295
01:48:38,520 --> 01:48:40,336
- Shut the fuck up!
- Will you get the fuck out of my video?

2296
01:48:40,360 --> 01:48:41,496
I'mma slap the dogshit out of you.

2297
01:48:41,520 --> 01:48:42,656
Why do you do your video behind me?

2298
01:48:42,680 --> 01:48:44,016
- I'm trying to do my video!
- This is my video!

2299
01:48:44,040 --> 01:48:45,656
- You're in my fucking video!
- I'm pissed off.

2300
01:48:45,680 --> 01:48:47,296
Watch your mouth,
I'll slap the shit out of you.

2301
01:48:47,320 --> 01:48:48,320
Fuck you!

2302
01:48:49,280 --> 01:48:51,794
Okay. You have it your way.

2303
01:48:52,760 --> 01:48:54,751
You leave me no choice.

2304
01:48:56,040 --> 01:48:57,040
Pam...

2305
01:48:58,360 --> 01:48:59,360
Tickler! Tickler!

2306
01:48:59,520 --> 01:49:02,034
Where are the codes? Where are the codes?

2307
01:49:03,040 --> 01:49:04,519
It's just nice.

2308
01:49:06,200 --> 01:49:08,760
In here and it's kind of all...

2309
01:49:10,280 --> 01:49:11,679
- Oh, my God.
- Sorry.

2310
01:49:16,280 --> 01:49:17,633
- Can you do both?
- Yeah.

2311
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:19,115
Oh, my God!

2312
01:49:22,360 --> 01:49:24,157
It's called "soul gazing."

2313
01:49:24,320 --> 01:49:27,869
Stare into my soul
and I'll stare into yours.

2314
01:49:28,080 --> 01:49:29,520
- Come in. Shh.
- You're not my wife!

2315
01:49:29,680 --> 01:49:31,079
Oh, that's it.

2316
01:49:32,960 --> 01:49:34,359
- Bob, I'm gonna...
- Shh.

2317
01:49:35,480 --> 01:49:37,240
I promise you'll never...

2318
01:49:38,160 --> 01:49:39,832
Let's keep on, keep on.

2319
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:41,400
<i>Okay, for real this time.</i>

2320
01:49:42,160 --> 01:49:44,151
It's for real.
This is for real, guys, yeah.

2321
01:49:44,680 --> 01:49:45,795
- That's it!
- Oh.

2322
01:49:45,960 --> 01:49:47,473
One more. Come on.

2323
01:49:47,680 --> 01:49:48,936
- I can't do this, I'm not...
- Shh.

2324
01:49:48,960 --> 01:49:51,633
Oh, my God. I've fucking had it.

2325
01:49:51,800 --> 01:49:52,936
Lock it! We're professionals.

2326
01:49:52,960 --> 01:49:54,880
- This is what we do. You ready?
- Come on, baby!

2327
01:49:54,920 --> 01:49:56,638
I'm gonna hit you. I told you!

2328
01:49:56,800 --> 01:49:57,994
Fuck!

2329
01:49:59,960 --> 01:50:00,960
Are you not a super tool?

2330
01:50:01,120 --> 01:50:03,395
You're not even Robbie Wheirdicht.
You're Bob Stone!

2331
01:50:04,120 --> 01:50:05,776
- I made that name up.
- So what?

2332
01:50:05,800 --> 01:50:07,320
- It's not real.
- What does that mean?

2333
01:50:07,440 --> 01:50:11,319
What, you think Mr. T and Sting

2334
01:50:11,480 --> 01:50:12,708
and The Rock...

2335
01:50:12,880 --> 01:50:14,359
You think those guys are real?

2336
01:50:14,520 --> 01:50:17,512
That's a bunch of dumbass nicknames
by a bunch of dumbass people.

2337
01:56:02,720 --> 01:56:03,994
<i>Fanny!</i>
