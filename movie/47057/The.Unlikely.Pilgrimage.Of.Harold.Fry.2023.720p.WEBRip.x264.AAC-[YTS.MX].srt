3
00:01:14,143 --> 00:01:16,110
Who do we know
in Berwick-upon-Tweed?

4
00:01:16,628 --> 00:01:17,663
We don't.

5
00:01:19,389 --> 00:01:20,804
That's north, isn't it?

6
00:01:22,703 --> 00:01:23,980
Careful.

7
00:01:37,545 --> 00:01:40,238
Oh, good Lord.
It's from Queenie Hennessy.

8
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:43,275
Who?

9
00:01:44,069 --> 00:01:45,864
She was at the brewery
years ago.

10
00:01:46,589 --> 00:01:47,866
Gave her a lift sometimes.

11
00:01:55,943 --> 00:01:57,117
Harold?

12
00:01:58,566 --> 00:01:59,912
She's in a hospice.

13
00:02:01,638 --> 00:02:03,053
She's just saying goodbye.

14
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:10,440
It's a nice day.

15
00:02:11,993 --> 00:02:14,099
Why don't you get out
the patio chairs?

16
00:02:44,992 --> 00:02:46,442
Are you still sitting there?

17
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:49,514
I'm writing Queenie a note.
Only nothing feels right.

18
00:02:50,998 --> 00:02:53,621
I don't see why you can't email
like any normal person.

19
00:02:54,484 --> 00:02:55,589
Do you want to do it?

20
00:02:55,727 --> 00:02:56,866
Why would I do it?

21
00:02:57,004 --> 00:02:59,006
I don't know. You're good
at this sort of thing.

22
00:02:59,351 --> 00:03:00,835
You're the one
that worked with her.

23
00:03:01,146 --> 00:03:02,389
Say something you mean.

24
00:03:34,179 --> 00:03:35,180
I'm off.

25
00:03:35,836 --> 00:03:36,699
Will you be long?

26
00:03:38,425 --> 00:03:39,805
I'm only going to the post box.

27
00:03:58,134 --> 00:04:00,101
- Morning, Harold.
- Morning, Rex.

28
00:04:00,516 --> 00:04:02,034
- Lovely day.
- Yeah.

29
00:04:02,172 --> 00:04:03,243
Off for a walk?

30
00:04:03,898 --> 00:04:05,866
- Post box.
- I don't get letters.

31
00:04:06,936 --> 00:04:08,248
Since Elizabeth passed,

32
00:04:08,386 --> 00:04:10,146
- I only get circulars.

33
00:04:18,016 --> 00:04:19,224
Thank you.

34
00:04:45,595 --> 00:04:47,010
Want me to take that?

35
00:04:48,771 --> 00:04:50,324
It's okay.
I'm going to the post office.

36
00:05:26,602 --> 00:05:27,672
Harold?

37
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:09,886
Fuel?

38
00:06:10,024 --> 00:06:11,474
No, thank you.

39
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:14,512
- Is that a letter?
- For a friend.

40
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,479
Aw, cute.

41
00:06:16,721 --> 00:06:17,687
She has cancer.

42
00:06:22,899 --> 00:06:24,453
Better go and post it now, huh?
And go home.

43
00:06:24,729 --> 00:06:26,109
My aunt had cancer.

44
00:06:26,938 --> 00:06:27,973
Do you want a bag?

45
00:06:28,249 --> 00:06:29,837
- Sorry?
- For the milk.

46
00:06:29,975 --> 00:06:32,288
- No, it's okay.
- But you can't give up.

47
00:06:33,427 --> 00:06:34,842
It's not about the medicine
and that.

48
00:06:35,256 --> 00:06:38,190
It's about what's in here.
Gotta have faith.

49
00:06:42,332 --> 00:06:45,059
- Am I talking crap?
- Not at all.

50
00:06:46,233 --> 00:06:47,752
I'm afraid religion's
not something

51
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:49,063
I ever quite got the hang of.

52
00:06:49,201 --> 00:06:50,755
I don't mean, like, religious.

53
00:06:51,203 --> 00:06:54,172
I mean, like, believing
you can make a difference.

54
00:06:54,966 --> 00:06:56,381
And your aunt got better?

55
00:06:56,519 --> 00:06:58,314
- Because you believed she could?
- Yeah.

56
00:06:58,452 --> 00:07:01,593
She said it gave her hope
when everything else had gone.

57
00:07:20,405 --> 00:07:21,751
<i>St. Bernadine's Hospice.</i>

58
00:07:21,889 --> 00:07:24,892
I'd like to speak to a patient,
please. Queenie Hennessy.

59
00:07:25,237 --> 00:07:26,549
I need to tell her something.

60
00:07:27,101 --> 00:07:28,793
<i>I'm afraid that's not possible.</i>

61
00:07:29,897 --> 00:07:31,002
Am I too late?

62
00:07:31,312 --> 00:07:33,004
<i>Queenie's asleep right now.</i>

63
00:07:33,142 --> 00:07:34,488
<i>But I can take a message.</i>

64
00:07:39,286 --> 00:07:42,254
Tell her Harold Fry...

65
00:07:43,739 --> 00:07:44,878
is on his way.

66
00:07:45,568 --> 00:07:47,777
<i>His what?</i>
- His way.

67
00:07:48,571 --> 00:07:50,124
All she has to do is wait.

68
00:07:50,504 --> 00:07:52,299
Because I'm going to save her,
you see.

69
00:07:53,818 --> 00:07:56,061
I'll keep walking,
and she must keep living.

70
00:07:56,199 --> 00:07:58,408
<i>It's a terrible line.
What are you doing?</i>

71
00:07:58,719 --> 00:08:01,929
- I'm walking.
<i>Oh, right. Okay.</i>

72
00:08:02,447 --> 00:08:04,691
<i>I'll tell her. You're walking?</i>

73
00:08:05,001 --> 00:08:07,072
From South Devon
to Berwick-upon-Tweed.

74
00:08:07,210 --> 00:08:09,730
- I'm setting off right now.

75
00:08:10,524 --> 00:08:12,630
As long as I walk,
she must live.

76
00:08:12,768 --> 00:08:15,840
Please tell her this time,
I won't let her down.

77
00:08:40,692 --> 00:08:41,831
Well, then.

78
00:08:44,903 --> 00:08:46,318
You always do this.

79
00:08:46,836 --> 00:08:49,563
You say you're ready,
then you fetch more crap.

80
00:08:52,186 --> 00:08:53,325
Cheerio.

81
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,025
Hello.

82
00:09:07,236 --> 00:09:08,617
Whoo-hoo!

83
00:09:35,402 --> 00:09:36,576
Oh.

84
00:10:06,226 --> 00:10:07,261
Who knew?

85
00:10:18,341 --> 00:10:20,447
<i>I'm walking
to Berwick-upon-Tweed.</i>

86
00:10:22,725 --> 00:10:23,933
You're what?

87
00:10:24,071 --> 00:10:26,108
<i>I'm going to save
Queenie Hennessy.</i>

88
00:10:27,281 --> 00:10:28,628
Have you been drinking?

89
00:10:28,766 --> 00:10:31,803
There was a girl in the garage.
She had blue hair.

90
00:10:31,941 --> 00:10:34,012
She saved her aunt, she told me.

91
00:10:34,288 --> 00:10:36,359
You can't save people
with cancer,

92
00:10:36,497 --> 00:10:37,913
not unless you're a surgeon.

93
00:10:38,292 --> 00:10:39,949
<i>And you never walk!</i>

94
00:10:41,157 --> 00:10:42,676
<i>You've never walked
in your life!</i>

95
00:10:42,814 --> 00:10:44,816
<i>The only time you walk
is to get to the car.</i>

96
00:10:44,954 --> 00:10:45,990
I know.

97
00:10:46,128 --> 00:10:48,509
This is ridiculous. Come home.

98
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:51,202
It isn't enough
to post a letter.

99
00:10:52,479 --> 00:10:55,655
Please.
I need to do this, Maureen.

100
00:10:56,966 --> 00:11:00,176
Well... if that's what you need.

101
00:11:01,557 --> 00:11:02,903
I had no idea.

102
00:11:04,042 --> 00:11:08,391
<i>Walk. Why not?
Walk to Berwick-upon-Tweed.</i>

103
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:10,980
It can only be about 500 miles!

104
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:18,678
Harold?

105
00:12:00,374 --> 00:12:02,549
You will not die.

106
00:12:02,825 --> 00:12:07,071
You will not die.
You will not die.

107
00:12:07,347 --> 00:12:11,731
You will not die.
You will not die.

108
00:12:15,942 --> 00:12:20,049
You will not die.
Die you will not.

109
00:12:20,394 --> 00:12:23,087
- You'll not die, will you not.

110
00:12:35,789 --> 00:12:39,793
You will not die.
You will not die.

111
00:12:40,449 --> 00:12:42,520
Not die you will.

112
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:44,936
Will you not die.

113
00:12:45,592 --> 00:12:49,044
Die you will not.
Not, not, not.

114
00:12:56,914 --> 00:12:58,536
I walked eight miles today.

115
00:13:01,228 --> 00:13:02,540
You stink.

116
00:13:28,773 --> 00:13:31,983
- Everything all right, Maureen?
- Yes, thank you.

117
00:13:32,121 --> 00:13:33,813
Why isn't Harold doing the bins?

118
00:13:35,159 --> 00:13:36,816
- He's in bed.
- Is he poorly?

119
00:13:38,472 --> 00:13:41,510
- It's nothing. He slipped.
Oh, no! That's terrible.

120
00:13:41,648 --> 00:13:43,857
- Can I do anything?
- It's fine, Rex.

121
00:13:44,099 --> 00:13:45,652
He just needs to rest.

122
00:13:59,321 --> 00:14:00,632
See any hedgehogs today?

123
00:14:01,771 --> 00:14:03,014
Sorry.

124
00:14:33,734 --> 00:14:37,946
Die will you not.
Not will you die.

125
00:14:38,498 --> 00:14:41,950
Die will you not.
Not will you...

126
00:14:50,924 --> 00:14:54,824
Not. Not. Not, not, not.

127
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:59,105
Not. Not. Not, not, not.

128
00:15:13,878 --> 00:15:14,948
You all right?

129
00:15:15,604 --> 00:15:17,847
I don't suppose I could ask
for a glass of water.

130
00:15:28,582 --> 00:15:31,931
I had no idea water was so nice.

131
00:15:33,587 --> 00:15:34,864
You sure you're all right?

132
00:15:35,382 --> 00:15:36,625
I'm walking a long way,

133
00:15:36,763 --> 00:15:39,041
but I haven't quite
got the hang of it yet.

134
00:15:40,077 --> 00:15:41,837
Why don't you sit down
for a minute?

135
00:15:43,770 --> 00:15:44,909
Oh.

136
00:15:56,369 --> 00:15:59,924
You'd have thought walking
would be the simplest thing.

137
00:16:02,996 --> 00:16:06,137
It never ceases to amaze me
how difficult

138
00:16:06,275 --> 00:16:08,760
the things that are supposed
to be instinctive really are.

139
00:16:10,521 --> 00:16:11,729
Like eating.

140
00:16:13,489 --> 00:16:15,112
Some people have problems
with that.

141
00:16:17,597 --> 00:16:18,978
Sleeping, you know?

142
00:16:21,566 --> 00:16:22,878
Even children.

143
00:16:28,849 --> 00:16:30,196
Did you have any yourself?

144
00:16:31,783 --> 00:16:33,061
- One.
- Ah.

145
00:16:33,647 --> 00:16:35,511
- A son?
- Yeah.

146
00:16:36,443 --> 00:16:37,858
A man needs a son.

147
00:16:39,377 --> 00:16:41,483
Without a son,
he's the end of the line.

148
00:17:04,402 --> 00:17:06,232
Not, not, not.

149
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:10,201
So...

150
00:17:11,237 --> 00:17:12,928
- you're still...
<i>Yes.</i>

151
00:17:14,067 --> 00:17:15,206
You?

152
00:17:16,311 --> 00:17:17,588
<i>I'm still here.</i>

153
00:17:18,209 --> 00:17:20,177
<i>If that's what you mean.
I haven't gone anywhere.</i>

154
00:17:23,663 --> 00:17:26,907
Harold, when I said
you should go,

155
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:28,737
I didn't mean you should go.

156
00:17:29,462 --> 00:17:31,015
I meant you should come back.

157
00:17:33,466 --> 00:17:34,467
Harold?

158
00:17:36,883 --> 00:17:38,333
I made a promise.

159
00:17:41,439 --> 00:17:43,683
I suppose you've worked out
how much this is costing.

160
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:48,722
<i>I'll stick to a budget.
It's not as if we had plans.</i>

161
00:17:50,828 --> 00:17:52,071
Is it okay?

162
00:17:53,934 --> 00:17:56,351
<i>Okay?</i>
- Well, that I'm doing this.

163
00:17:56,730 --> 00:17:57,973
That I'm walking.

164
00:17:58,732 --> 00:18:00,355
I hardly notice you've gone.

165
00:19:14,808 --> 00:19:15,878
Oh.

166
00:19:34,138 --> 00:19:36,347
Excuse me, is this seat free?

167
00:19:36,968 --> 00:19:37,969
Of course.

168
00:19:52,225 --> 00:19:53,882
Goodbyes are always hard.

169
00:19:54,469 --> 00:19:55,642
They are.

170
00:20:00,958 --> 00:20:02,201
Would you like half?

171
00:20:02,477 --> 00:20:04,133
- No, I couldn't. No.
- No, no, please.

172
00:20:05,134 --> 00:20:06,343
I won't eat it all.

173
00:20:06,653 --> 00:20:08,483
- We'll share.
- Thank you.

174
00:20:12,694 --> 00:20:13,867
Mm.

175
00:20:24,568 --> 00:20:26,052
Can I ask a question?

176
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:28,261
You seem like
a decent sort of man.

177
00:20:28,675 --> 00:20:29,918
If you like.

178
00:20:33,577 --> 00:20:35,510
I come to Exeter every Thursday.

179
00:20:37,443 --> 00:20:39,134
I meet a young man, we...

180
00:20:40,204 --> 00:20:43,034
do things. No one else knows.

181
00:20:44,588 --> 00:20:45,623
Can I go on?

182
00:20:47,729 --> 00:20:48,902
Mm-hmm.

183
00:20:51,353 --> 00:20:52,941
His English is not so good.

184
00:20:55,875 --> 00:20:58,049
I believe he had polio
as a child.

185
00:20:59,948 --> 00:21:01,639
Sometimes causes him to limp.

186
00:21:04,539 --> 00:21:06,644
He moves me, this young man.

187
00:21:07,749 --> 00:21:11,028
He moves me beyond words. But...

188
00:21:12,132 --> 00:21:15,239
I lick his trainers.
It's part of what we do.

189
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:19,519
But I noticed today
that he had a hole at the toe.

190
00:21:21,245 --> 00:21:24,248
I want to buy him another pair,
but I don't want to offend him.

191
00:21:25,387 --> 00:21:26,423
Equally, I...

192
00:21:27,665 --> 00:21:30,565
can't bear the thought
of him walking the streets

193
00:21:30,703 --> 00:21:32,187
with a hole in his trainers.

194
00:21:33,464 --> 00:21:35,155
His foot will get wet.

195
00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:40,678
What should I do?

196
00:21:48,824 --> 00:21:50,619
I think I'd buy him
new trainers.

197
00:21:55,624 --> 00:21:56,798
Thank you.

198
00:23:19,363 --> 00:23:20,709
- Oh!

199
00:24:26,879 --> 00:24:28,087
Do you need a lift?

200
00:24:28,605 --> 00:24:30,503
- No, it's all right, thank you.
- You sure?

201
00:24:30,917 --> 00:24:32,091
I've made a promise.

202
00:24:47,382 --> 00:24:49,004
What do you know
of drift velocity?

203
00:24:52,801 --> 00:24:53,837
Well...

204
00:24:54,631 --> 00:24:56,011
Nothing.

205
00:24:58,289 --> 00:24:59,567
Who was Milton?

206
00:25:01,016 --> 00:25:02,501
Milton...?

207
00:25:03,950 --> 00:25:05,227
I don't know.

208
00:25:06,470 --> 00:25:07,782
For God's sake.

209
00:25:36,086 --> 00:25:38,226
I hear from your mother
you got into Cambridge.

210
00:26:36,733 --> 00:26:38,148
I hate you!

211
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:41,738
Fuck you!

212
00:26:45,534 --> 00:26:48,572
No! No! No.

213
00:27:03,207 --> 00:27:06,279
Thank you.
I'll be off in a minute.

214
00:27:08,903 --> 00:27:10,145
But you're fucked.

215
00:27:11,215 --> 00:27:13,045
Your shoes are fucked,
so is your body.

216
00:27:13,908 --> 00:27:15,772
Every way you look at it,
you're fucked.

217
00:27:16,945 --> 00:27:18,913
How do you think
you can make it to Berwick?

218
00:27:20,121 --> 00:27:21,329
I don't know.

219
00:27:22,779 --> 00:27:25,057
I failed Queenie once,
I can't do it again.

220
00:27:30,510 --> 00:27:32,720
I have a spare room.
You can stay the night.

221
00:27:37,103 --> 00:27:38,587
My son wanted a dog.

222
00:27:39,002 --> 00:27:40,900
It's not my dog.
It's my partner's.

223
00:27:56,467 --> 00:27:58,124
Harold?
- Yeah?

224
00:28:05,684 --> 00:28:08,238
- For your feet.
- You can't wash my feet.

225
00:28:10,481 --> 00:28:12,414
You're walking funny.
I need to look.

226
00:28:14,209 --> 00:28:15,590
There's no problem.

227
00:28:17,074 --> 00:28:19,767
Yeah? So how do you
take care of them?

228
00:28:20,871 --> 00:28:23,011
- I put on plasters.
- Hmm.

229
00:28:36,542 --> 00:28:37,888
Show me your leg.

230
00:28:38,026 --> 00:28:39,718
- That's okay.
- Show me.

231
00:28:48,416 --> 00:28:50,280
I know what I'm doing,
I'm fully trained.

232
00:28:50,763 --> 00:28:51,868
You're a nurse?

233
00:28:52,109 --> 00:28:54,940
A doctor.
They let women do it these days.

234
00:28:55,354 --> 00:28:56,596
Hmm!

235
00:28:58,598 --> 00:29:00,773
Give me your foot.
I won't send you home, Harold.

236
00:29:11,715 --> 00:29:13,821
If you continue to walk,
this will get worse.

237
00:29:14,373 --> 00:29:16,996
Your blisters are infected.
They need treating.

238
00:29:25,418 --> 00:29:27,144
Why don't you have proper boots?

239
00:29:29,457 --> 00:29:30,872
These are my shoes.

240
00:29:31,286 --> 00:29:33,875
My partner likes walking.
He has all the gear.

241
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:37,223
You must be a good doctor.

242
00:29:38,569 --> 00:29:40,675
I only get cleaning work
in England.

243
00:29:43,643 --> 00:29:45,197
You think your feet are bad?

244
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:47,199
You should see the toilets
I clean.

245
00:29:47,337 --> 00:29:48,787
Oh!

246
00:29:51,513 --> 00:29:54,862
So... did your son get his dog?

247
00:29:57,934 --> 00:30:00,177
I'm afraid I failed my son
very badly.

248
00:30:02,179 --> 00:30:04,837
Your son and Queenie?
You failed them both?

249
00:30:07,564 --> 00:30:08,876
It isn't good enough.

250
00:30:10,049 --> 00:30:11,430
Never will be.

251
00:30:20,404 --> 00:30:21,750
<i>So it's not about you?</i>

252
00:30:22,372 --> 00:30:23,511
My husband.

253
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:26,100
But he's not here.
- He's walking.

254
00:30:26,548 --> 00:30:29,068
To the surgery?
- To Berwick-upon-Tweed.

255
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,968
He believes he can save
a former colleague.

256
00:30:32,106 --> 00:30:33,176
She has cancer.

257
00:30:34,694 --> 00:30:36,696
And how does he mean
to save her?

258
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:39,320
He seems to think
the walk will do it.

259
00:30:40,286 --> 00:30:41,598
He left 11 days ago.

260
00:30:42,116 --> 00:30:44,325
A girl in a garage
gave him the idea.

261
00:30:47,328 --> 00:30:48,881
Harold doesn't walk.

262
00:30:49,744 --> 00:30:52,471
He could cause an accident.
He needs to be stopped.

263
00:30:56,095 --> 00:30:57,614
And he has Alzheimer's.

264
00:30:59,167 --> 00:31:01,549
I see. Uh...

265
00:31:02,791 --> 00:31:04,069
What medication is he on?

266
00:31:04,863 --> 00:31:08,073
Well, I mean,
it isn't diagnosed,

267
00:31:08,211 --> 00:31:10,523
not as such. But he forgets
things all the time.

268
00:31:10,661 --> 00:31:12,318
I mean,
he even forgot his phone.

269
00:31:13,216 --> 00:31:15,080
- He has no phone?
- Exactly.

270
00:31:16,081 --> 00:31:17,841
He's walking
the length of England

271
00:31:17,979 --> 00:31:19,878
and he hasn't got a phone.

272
00:31:22,639 --> 00:31:24,020
Mrs. Fry...

273
00:31:27,161 --> 00:31:28,852
just because your husband
forgot his phone,

274
00:31:29,404 --> 00:31:31,130
doesn't mean he has Alzheimer's.

275
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:33,305
It's good to walk.

276
00:31:33,581 --> 00:31:35,514
It's good for the body,
and the mind too.

277
00:31:36,756 --> 00:31:40,243
What he's doing, it may seem
a little unusual, but...

278
00:31:41,347 --> 00:31:42,693
he's not hurting anyone.

279
00:31:44,937 --> 00:31:46,387
It's beautiful.

280
00:32:59,322 --> 00:33:00,909
You need to rest another day.

281
00:33:01,324 --> 00:33:03,257
Ah, I have to get back
on the road.

282
00:33:03,912 --> 00:33:06,122
You must tell me
what I owe for the room.

283
00:33:13,646 --> 00:33:14,820
Here.

284
00:33:20,929 --> 00:33:22,276
Thank you!

285
00:33:25,831 --> 00:33:27,384
I'm sorry not to meet
your partner.

286
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:29,593
You can stay
as long as you like,

287
00:33:29,731 --> 00:33:30,870
you still won't meet him.

288
00:33:31,457 --> 00:33:32,562
Why?

289
00:33:33,597 --> 00:33:36,221
He's gone, Harold.
He doesn't live here anymore.

290
00:33:40,708 --> 00:33:42,537
I bet you think
I'm freaking crazy.

291
00:33:43,814 --> 00:33:45,023
No, I don't.

292
00:33:56,206 --> 00:33:57,863
We came here for a better life.

293
00:33:59,830 --> 00:34:03,248
A few months later,
this woman shows up with a baby.

294
00:34:04,525 --> 00:34:07,562
I didn't know about the woman.
I didn't know about the kid.

295
00:34:08,218 --> 00:34:10,117
I thought he was going
to boot them out,

296
00:34:10,255 --> 00:34:12,602
but when he picked up the baby,
it was like...

297
00:34:14,742 --> 00:34:16,261
seeing a man I didn't know.

298
00:34:18,504 --> 00:34:21,438
I went for a walk.
When I got back, they'd left.

299
00:34:23,854 --> 00:34:25,028
He might come home.

300
00:34:26,167 --> 00:34:27,479
It was a year ago.

301
00:34:29,619 --> 00:34:32,760
And here you are walking
to Berwick-upon-Tweed.

302
00:34:33,416 --> 00:34:36,419
If only I had a shred
of your faith, Harold.

303
00:34:37,799 --> 00:34:40,285
- But you do.
- No.

304
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:44,496
I'm waiting for something
that can never happen.

305
00:34:50,674 --> 00:34:52,331
- Yes?

306
00:34:56,301 --> 00:34:57,336
Here.

307
00:35:00,063 --> 00:35:01,340
Are you sure?

308
00:35:13,628 --> 00:35:14,871
Go well, Harold.

309
00:35:15,665 --> 00:35:17,356
And you owe me nothing
for the room.

310
00:35:17,667 --> 00:35:18,875
You were my guest.

311
00:35:28,954 --> 00:35:30,197
Maureen.

312
00:35:30,714 --> 00:35:32,509
I wonder, do you have any milk?

313
00:35:32,785 --> 00:35:35,063
Of course.
Do you want to come in?

314
00:35:35,616 --> 00:35:37,411
Oh, it's all right, thank you.
I'll wait.

315
00:35:45,177 --> 00:35:46,351
There you are.

316
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:49,147
- How's the patient?
- Good.

317
00:35:53,358 --> 00:35:56,533
He's not at home, Rex.
I've been lying.

318
00:35:59,295 --> 00:36:00,917
Did you think I don't know?

319
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:10,340
<i>It was me.</i>

320
00:36:12,653 --> 00:36:14,793
<i>It was always me
who talked of going.</i>

321
00:36:17,105 --> 00:36:19,349
<i>But I never did. I stayed.</i>

322
00:36:20,523 --> 00:36:23,215
<i>Because when it came to
walking away, I couldn't do it.</i>

323
00:36:24,561 --> 00:36:25,838
Even though it was...

324
00:36:28,047 --> 00:36:29,670
so terrible.

325
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:32,466
I said things once...

326
00:36:34,571 --> 00:36:36,849
I can't bear to think
about the things I said.

327
00:36:39,335 --> 00:36:41,923
<i>The world without Harold
would have been worse.</i>

328
00:36:45,341 --> 00:36:46,825
<i>And now he's done it.</i>

329
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:49,966
<i>He's walking to Queenie.</i>

330
00:36:53,245 --> 00:36:55,351
And I'm frightened
he won't come back.

331
00:36:57,939 --> 00:36:59,941
We could drive to find him,
if you like.

332
00:37:01,046 --> 00:37:02,668
It would only take a few hours.

333
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:05,637
Maybe.

334
00:37:09,399 --> 00:37:10,642
<i>No, I can't.</i>

335
00:37:12,609 --> 00:37:14,611
<i>Supposing he doesn't
want to see me.</i>

336
00:37:18,374 --> 00:37:19,651
<i>To tell you the truth,</i>

337
00:37:22,274 --> 00:37:24,863
it hasn't been a marriage
for 25 years.

338
00:37:28,107 --> 00:37:30,075
- Did you know her?
- Who?

339
00:37:30,213 --> 00:37:31,594
- Queenie.
- No.

340
00:37:35,391 --> 00:37:37,496
- I met her once.
Oh?

341
00:37:39,049 --> 00:37:41,259
She came to the house
with a message for Harold.

342
00:37:45,435 --> 00:37:46,781
<i>I sent her away.</i>

343
00:37:49,784 --> 00:37:51,303
<i>He never saw her again.</i>

344
00:37:53,754 --> 00:37:56,343
Harold hasn't walked out on you, Maureen.

345
00:37:58,517 --> 00:38:00,001
That's not what this is about.

346
00:38:01,244 --> 00:38:02,521
But, Rex...

347
00:38:03,453 --> 00:38:05,352
I never gave him the message.

348
00:38:08,424 --> 00:38:12,359
You'll not die.
Will you not die.

349
00:38:12,497 --> 00:38:14,706
You will not die.

350
00:38:46,185 --> 00:38:47,532
Oh, that's tough.

351
00:38:48,912 --> 00:38:50,431
But it's good
your friend's comfortable.

352
00:38:50,742 --> 00:38:51,846
She's in the best place.

353
00:38:52,433 --> 00:38:53,917
Do you know someone
in a hospice?

354
00:38:54,159 --> 00:38:55,367
Er, I'm a surgeon.

355
00:38:55,505 --> 00:38:57,265
I treat people with cancer.

356
00:38:59,889 --> 00:39:02,857
I met a Slovakian lady.
She's a doctor.

357
00:39:03,996 --> 00:39:05,653
She can only get cleaning work.

358
00:39:08,691 --> 00:39:11,935
So, this walk for your friend,
it's a sponsored event?

359
00:39:12,557 --> 00:39:15,387
- She's waiting.
Excuse me?

360
00:39:16,388 --> 00:39:18,356
I'll keep walking,
she'll keep living.

361
00:39:18,804 --> 00:39:20,012
I'm going to save her.

362
00:39:21,255 --> 00:39:24,154
Oh, I see. Yeah.

363
00:39:25,293 --> 00:39:27,434
Uh, so, you're a religious man?

364
00:39:27,917 --> 00:39:29,159
No.

365
00:39:30,022 --> 00:39:33,509
I am. My wife and I,
we go to church every week.

366
00:39:33,923 --> 00:39:36,788
But cancer isn't about belief,

367
00:39:36,926 --> 00:39:38,099
it's about medicine.

368
00:39:38,237 --> 00:39:40,481
And when someone
goes to a hospice,

369
00:39:40,999 --> 00:39:42,966
it's because there's nothing
more we can do.

370
00:39:44,312 --> 00:39:45,659
It means it's the end.

371
00:39:46,867 --> 00:39:49,766
- When did your friend write?
- Three weeks ago.

372
00:39:50,042 --> 00:39:51,941
And you've been on the road
ever since?

373
00:39:52,735 --> 00:39:55,807
If I may say, you look tired.

374
00:39:56,877 --> 00:39:58,844
Is it really necessary
to do all this?

375
00:40:01,157 --> 00:40:04,471
Look, I'm sorry.
I should have kept quiet.

376
00:40:04,609 --> 00:40:06,990
My wife always says I interfere.

377
00:40:07,232 --> 00:40:08,233
It's fine.

378
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:10,373
Look,
you keep walking.

379
00:40:11,478 --> 00:40:12,686
Good luck!

380
00:40:53,209 --> 00:40:54,417
David?

381
00:41:00,043 --> 00:41:01,459
Sorry.

382
00:41:42,534 --> 00:41:43,949
<i>St Bernadine's Hospice.</i>

383
00:41:44,363 --> 00:41:46,400
Could I leave a message
for Queenie Hennessy?

384
00:41:47,677 --> 00:41:49,265
<i>Are you the gentleman
who's travelling by foot?</i>

385
00:41:50,473 --> 00:41:51,681
I was.

386
00:41:52,061 --> 00:41:53,925
<i>Sister Philomena
was hoping you'd call.</i>

387
00:41:54,339 --> 00:41:56,479
<i>- She has news.</i>

388
00:41:59,551 --> 00:42:01,277
<i>Mr. Fry?</i>
- HAROLD; Hmm?

389
00:42:01,657 --> 00:42:05,557
<i>I'm going to be frank with you.
Queenie has no family.</i>

390
00:42:06,075 --> 00:42:09,009
<i>When people have no one,
they tend to pass quickly.</i>

391
00:42:09,388 --> 00:42:10,666
I see.

392
00:42:11,011 --> 00:42:13,254
<i>So, the change is remarkable.</i>

393
00:42:13,392 --> 00:42:15,878
<i>To be honest,
I don't know how to explain.</i>

394
00:42:16,361 --> 00:42:17,569
I... I'm sorry?

395
00:42:17,845 --> 00:42:20,261
<i>She shows off your postcards!</i>

396
00:42:20,607 --> 00:42:22,643
<i>Some days she even sits up!</i>

397
00:42:23,644 --> 00:42:24,680
She's waiting?

398
00:42:25,128 --> 00:42:26,371
<i>Yes, Mr. Fry.</i>

399
00:42:26,509 --> 00:42:28,718
<i>- Just as you asked.</i>

400
00:42:29,029 --> 00:42:31,065
<i>I must admit,
when you first rang,</i>

401
00:42:31,203 --> 00:42:32,826
<i>I was afraid
you'd misunderstood</i>

402
00:42:32,964 --> 00:42:35,380
<i>the gravity of things.
But I was wrong.</i>

403
00:42:36,070 --> 00:42:38,072
<i>Maybe it's what the world
needs right now.</i>

404
00:42:38,728 --> 00:42:40,972
<i>A little less sense
and a bit more faith.</i>

405
00:42:41,110 --> 00:42:43,630
- Yes!

406
00:42:44,078 --> 00:42:45,459
<i>When should we expect you?</i>

407
00:42:45,873 --> 00:42:48,876
In three weeks.
Possibly more, maybe less.

408
00:42:49,394 --> 00:42:51,292
<i>Goodness!
I'll tell Queenie.</i>

409
00:42:51,879 --> 00:42:53,501
And tell her not to give up.

410
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:55,849
Tell her I will keep walking.

411
00:42:56,504 --> 00:42:57,747
<i>I will.</i>

412
00:42:58,541 --> 00:43:01,648
Even when she doubts,
she must not give in.

413
00:43:03,235 --> 00:43:04,582
She must keep living.

414
00:43:05,065 --> 00:43:06,514
<i>I believe she will.</i>

415
00:43:07,032 --> 00:43:08,965
<i>God bless you, Mr. Fry.</i>

416
00:44:16,654 --> 00:44:17,896

Here's to the walk.

434
00:48:31,805 --> 00:48:33,255
Are you sure
you don't want a beer?

435
00:48:33,876 --> 00:48:35,153
Lemonade's perfect.

436
00:48:36,879 --> 00:48:38,156
Do you really believe
you can do it?

437
00:48:38,743 --> 00:48:40,607
If I keep putting one foot
in front of the other,

438
00:48:40,745 --> 00:48:41,849
it stands to reason
I'll get there.

439
00:48:43,782 --> 00:48:46,785
What you're doing, man,
it's awesome.

440
00:48:47,890 --> 00:48:49,719
I don't suppose I could
trouble you for a crisp.

441
00:48:50,203 --> 00:48:51,342
Yeah, of course.

442
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,415
And you're in love
with the woman in Berwick?

443
00:48:56,864 --> 00:48:58,245
I'm in love with my wife.

444
00:49:01,939 --> 00:49:05,080
Could I take your photo?
Just to remember ya.

445
00:49:05,218 --> 00:49:06,633
Hmm! Oh.

446
00:50:14,735 --> 00:50:16,013
I wish you could see.

447
00:50:44,248 --> 00:50:45,490
Harold Fry?

448
00:50:46,353 --> 00:50:48,666
- Yes?
- Amazing.

449
00:50:50,081 --> 00:50:51,772
Ooh! What can I give you?

450
00:50:52,049 --> 00:50:53,188
No! Nothing.

451
00:50:55,707 --> 00:50:57,019
Here.

452
00:50:58,262 --> 00:50:59,228
Thank you.

453
00:50:59,366 --> 00:51:01,334
It's so lovely to meet you.

454
00:51:02,231 --> 00:51:03,646
It's lovely to meet you too.

455
00:51:16,038 --> 00:51:18,730
<i>...and a few showers coming in
overnight from the west.</i>

456
00:51:19,076 --> 00:51:23,459
<i>And now, we have the amazing
story of a retired local man</i>

457
00:51:23,701 --> 00:51:26,945
<i>who is walking from South Devon
to Berwick-upon-Tweed.</i>

458
00:51:30,156 --> 00:51:32,227
<i>I take care
not to upset anything.</i>

459
00:51:32,365 --> 00:51:33,573
<i>Oh.</i>

460
00:51:33,711 --> 00:51:36,334
I never force a lock.
<i>No.</i>

461
00:51:37,404 --> 00:51:38,785
How about you, Maureen?

462
00:51:39,751 --> 00:51:41,063
Oh, well, you know.

463
00:51:42,927 --> 00:51:45,412
I've nothing, really.
I'm just at home.

464
00:51:46,827 --> 00:51:50,176
Harold?
Have you seen the news?

465
00:51:50,866 --> 00:51:52,039
No, why? What is it?

466
00:51:52,902 --> 00:51:54,249
<i>It's you, Harold.</i>

467
00:51:54,766 --> 00:51:57,907
You and Queenie.
You're everywhere.

468
00:52:07,262 --> 00:52:08,435
Mr. Fry!

469
00:52:11,300 --> 00:52:12,405
Mr. Fry!

470
00:52:12,543 --> 00:52:13,716
Mr. Fry!

471
00:52:15,787 --> 00:52:17,375
Harold! Yeah!

472
00:52:21,379 --> 00:52:22,380
Mr. Fry!

473
00:52:23,795 --> 00:52:25,901
Mr. Fry!

474
00:52:28,731 --> 00:52:30,112
It's Wilf.

475
00:52:30,250 --> 00:52:31,665
- Sorry?
- Wilf.

476
00:52:31,803 --> 00:52:34,047
It's my name. I've come
to be a pilgrim, Mr. Fry.

477
00:52:34,185 --> 00:52:35,876
- A what?
- I'm gonna save Queenie too.

478
00:52:36,014 --> 00:52:37,982
I've got my sleeping bag
and everything.

479
00:52:38,638 --> 00:52:39,949
I'm sorry, what are you doing?

480
00:52:40,502 --> 00:52:42,573
I said,
"If I should go to Mr. Fry,

481
00:52:43,332 --> 00:52:44,506
"give me a sign."

482
00:52:44,644 --> 00:52:46,163
- And guess what.
- I don't know.

483
00:52:46,818 --> 00:52:48,165
He gave me a dove.

484
00:52:48,924 --> 00:52:50,546
- Who?
- The Lord!

485
00:52:51,271 --> 00:52:52,583
The Lord gave you a dove?

486
00:52:52,721 --> 00:52:54,067
Yeah, kind of. It had wings.

487
00:52:54,205 --> 00:52:56,552
The point is, it was a sign,
you know?

488
00:52:56,690 --> 00:52:59,072
If you ask the way,
He'll guide you.

489
00:52:59,210 --> 00:53:01,592
And He could get you
a parking space as well.

490
00:53:01,730 --> 00:53:03,801
I'm not really in need
of a parking space.

491
00:53:05,734 --> 00:53:06,666
Mr. Fry, I didn't know

492
00:53:06,804 --> 00:53:08,530
- you had a dog.
- I don't.

493
00:53:10,048 --> 00:53:11,153
Whose is it, then?

494
00:53:11,740 --> 00:53:12,879
I don't know.

495
00:53:19,230 --> 00:53:21,474
Hey, look. Come on.

496
00:53:25,685 --> 00:53:27,307
See? It likes us.

497
00:53:30,621 --> 00:53:31,725
Come on.

498
00:53:33,382 --> 00:53:36,592
The Lord loves me, you know.
And you too, Mr. Fry.

499
00:53:36,937 --> 00:53:38,939
And Queenie, as well.
And the dog, as well.

500
00:53:39,077 --> 00:53:42,115
He loves us all.
You just gotta open your heart.

501
00:53:42,391 --> 00:53:44,151
You know, and I never
knew this before,

502
00:53:44,290 --> 00:53:46,257
but I do now,
and sometimes...

503
00:53:46,947 --> 00:53:49,433
I feel His light.
You know, and it's warm, and...

504
00:53:49,571 --> 00:53:52,539
I know He's gonna guide me.
And it's...

505
00:53:52,850 --> 00:53:54,472
- Hang on a minute.
- You all right?

506
00:53:54,886 --> 00:53:56,474
Yeah, man. Yeah.

507
00:54:00,340 --> 00:54:02,100
I'm coming.

508
00:54:05,103 --> 00:54:06,312
Do we stop soon?

509
00:54:07,140 --> 00:54:08,693
Can you light a fire, Wilf?

510
00:54:08,831 --> 00:54:10,350
Can I shit, Mr. Fry.

511
00:54:10,971 --> 00:54:13,250
- Where's your petrol?
I just need a match.

512
00:54:30,750 --> 00:54:31,820
Wow.

513
00:54:39,448 --> 00:54:42,417
-  Can I do that?
- If you want.

514
00:54:42,934 --> 00:54:44,039
Yeah.

515
00:54:50,977 --> 00:54:52,012
How old are you, Wilf?

516
00:54:53,290 --> 00:54:54,498
Twenty-five.

517
00:54:57,466 --> 00:54:58,950
I'm twenty.

518
00:55:00,089 --> 00:55:01,125
Eighteen.

519
00:55:03,610 --> 00:55:05,060
Do your parents know
where you are?

520
00:55:05,681 --> 00:55:06,855
They don't give a shit.

521
00:55:10,514 --> 00:55:13,033
Wilf, you can't walk with me
to Berwick-on-Tweed.

522
00:55:14,759 --> 00:55:16,140
I just wanna do something
with my life.

523
00:55:16,485 --> 00:55:18,384
You know,
most kids I know are on pills.

524
00:55:19,730 --> 00:55:20,765
Are you?

525
00:55:21,318 --> 00:55:22,629
I quit.

526
00:55:23,181 --> 00:55:25,218
And I quit the booze too.
I'm clean.

527
00:55:30,499 --> 00:55:32,190
Please let me walk with you,
Mr. Fry.

528
00:55:50,623 --> 00:55:52,072
Do I know this isn't poisonous?

529
00:55:54,558 --> 00:55:56,422
I'm eating it. Look at me.

530
00:56:02,220 --> 00:56:03,636
Yuck!

531
00:56:07,812 --> 00:56:09,158
It's not that bad.

532
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:14,923
Don't you get scared?

533
00:56:16,407 --> 00:56:17,960
I used to sleep badly.

534
00:56:20,515 --> 00:56:21,964
But since I've been in the open,

535
00:56:22,102 --> 00:56:24,001
it seems there's less
to be afraid of.

536
00:56:28,315 --> 00:56:29,524
Can we pray?

537
00:56:32,423 --> 00:56:34,321
- Do you want to?
Yeah.

538
00:56:37,739 --> 00:56:39,016
You can if you like.

539
00:57:03,696 --> 00:57:04,697
What was that?

540
00:57:06,353 --> 00:57:07,734
Foxes.

541
00:57:10,392 --> 00:57:11,635
Dogs, maybe.

542
00:57:12,429 --> 00:57:13,637
Sheep.

543
00:57:15,259 --> 00:57:16,985
We didn't pass any sheep.

544
00:57:20,575 --> 00:57:21,955
It's full-on freaky.

545
00:57:29,825 --> 00:57:32,690
- Come here. It's all right.

546
00:57:34,002 --> 00:57:35,417
It's all right.

547
00:57:36,936 --> 00:57:38,213
Nothing will hurt you.

548
00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:51,537
You see it?
Yeah, it's cool.

549
00:58:00,442 --> 00:58:02,202
Don't take more
than we need, Wilf.

550
00:58:02,858 --> 00:58:03,859
Okay.

551
00:58:06,103 --> 00:58:09,520
One... two...

552
00:58:12,281 --> 00:58:14,180
...four... six.

553
00:58:27,331 --> 00:58:29,471
<i>And we leave you with an update</i>

554
00:58:29,609 --> 00:58:31,231
<i>on a local man, Harold Fry,</i>

555
00:58:31,611 --> 00:58:33,544
<i>who left his home
in Kingsbridge</i>

556
00:58:33,682 --> 00:58:37,583
<i>to walk over 470 miles
to Berwick-upon-Tweed.</i>

557
00:58:37,721 --> 00:58:39,895
<i>Harold! When do you
hope to get to Queenie?</i>

558
00:58:40,033 --> 00:58:41,069
<i>About two weeks.</i>

559
00:58:41,897 --> 00:58:43,105
<i>Two or three weeks.</i>

560
00:58:43,899 --> 00:58:46,592
<i>We'll get there.
Me and him. Together.</i>

561
00:58:47,696 --> 00:58:49,387
<i>We caught up
with him in Sheffield</i>

562
00:58:49,698 --> 00:58:53,046
<i>where he's been recognized and
warmly welcomed by well-wishers</i>

563
00:58:53,391 --> 00:58:55,497
<i>encouraging him on his journey.</i>

564
00:58:55,911 --> 00:58:59,087
<i>Thank you very much.
Very nice. Look.</i>

565
00:58:59,225 --> 00:59:01,779
<i>- I'll take that.
- Hang on to that. Here we go.</i>

566
00:59:03,229 --> 00:59:04,644
<i>Keep walking, Harold.</i>

567
00:59:05,024 --> 00:59:06,784
<i>But I'm not doing anything!</i>

568
00:59:06,922 --> 00:59:11,133
I'm just here, day in, day out.
Staring at the same four walls!

569
00:59:11,271 --> 00:59:14,481
You're waiting for Harold.
- Queenie's waiting!

570
00:59:16,863 --> 00:59:18,900
You have to believe in him.

571
00:59:19,038 --> 00:59:20,660
Yes, but who believes in me?

572
00:59:21,868 --> 00:59:25,078
I see him on the television,
and everyone's clapping him.

573
00:59:25,492 --> 00:59:27,771
And he looks... so happy.

574
00:59:28,150 --> 00:59:29,980
And now he's got
this young man with him,

575
00:59:30,567 --> 00:59:31,982
and I don't know who he is.

576
00:59:32,499 --> 00:59:33,880
It would be easier
if he were dead!

577
00:59:34,018 --> 00:59:35,606
At least I'd I know
where I stood.

578
00:59:39,196 --> 00:59:40,749
That's a terrible thing to say.

579
00:59:44,097 --> 00:59:45,789
You know what I most regret?

580
00:59:48,377 --> 00:59:50,587
No.
- That I didn't fight it.

581
00:59:53,382 --> 00:59:54,591
But how could you?

582
00:59:55,212 --> 00:59:57,179
When the doctors said
Elizabeth was dying,

583
00:59:57,870 --> 01:00:00,113
I gave up. We both did.

584
01:00:01,736 --> 01:00:04,152
I know it wouldn't have made
any difference,

585
01:00:04,739 --> 01:00:09,053
but I wish I'd let her see
how much I wanted to keep her.

586
01:00:11,055 --> 01:00:12,919
I should have raged, Maureen.

587
01:00:14,611 --> 01:00:16,578
I should have raged.

588
01:00:23,205 --> 01:00:27,244
Go, Fry, go! Go, Fry, go!

589
01:00:27,382 --> 01:00:29,142
Come on, Mr. Fry. Come on.

590
01:00:29,626 --> 01:00:33,630
Go, Fry, go!
Go, Fry, go! Go, Fry, go!

591
01:00:33,768 --> 01:00:34,941
This way!

592
01:00:35,217 --> 01:00:37,772
Go, Fry, go! Go, Fry, go!

593
01:00:38,635 --> 01:00:41,154
Go, Fry, go! Go, Fry, go!

594
01:00:41,292 --> 01:00:43,778
- Go, Fry, go! Go, Fry, go!
- Good morning.

595
01:00:46,435 --> 01:00:48,610
So, I was thinking,
we could all wear T-shirts.

596
01:00:48,748 --> 01:00:49,922
- Oh?
- That way, people

597
01:00:50,060 --> 01:00:51,302
will know who we are.

598
01:00:51,578 --> 01:00:53,132
- Oh, okay.
- Obviously it's your call.

599
01:00:53,270 --> 01:00:55,652
But I've got a mate who can sort
this. He can do it in a day.

600
01:00:55,790 --> 01:00:57,688
- Do what?
- Well, the T-shirts.

601
01:00:58,378 --> 01:01:01,796
Oh. Oh, I see. Yes.

602
01:01:01,934 --> 01:01:03,763
Harold Fry?
- Yes?

603
01:01:06,490 --> 01:01:07,594
On the house.

604
01:01:08,181 --> 01:01:09,873
- Really?
- Is all that for free?

605
01:01:12,220 --> 01:01:13,393
Here you are.

606
01:01:15,361 --> 01:01:17,052
Guys, I got pizza!
Who wants some?

607
01:01:27,822 --> 01:01:29,996
- Good night, Harold.
- Good night, Kate.

608
01:01:34,587 --> 01:01:35,864
Oh, yes!

609
01:01:37,832 --> 01:01:39,247
Coming your way.

610
01:01:41,111 --> 01:01:43,182
Yes! Again, and again.

611
01:02:09,691 --> 01:02:11,624
- How does it look?
Good.

612
01:02:12,798 --> 01:02:14,731
Pilgrim?
- Yeah, pilgrim.

613
01:02:26,328 --> 01:02:28,986
- Mr. Fry's pilgrimage!

614
01:02:30,677 --> 01:02:31,989
I think this is wrong.

615
01:02:32,990 --> 01:02:35,061
- What?
- All this.

616
01:02:36,511 --> 01:02:38,409
These people
don't even know Queenie.

617
01:02:39,894 --> 01:02:41,033
Maybe I should go.

618
01:02:42,172 --> 01:02:44,968
- Go where?
- I don't know, on ahead.

619
01:02:46,210 --> 01:02:47,315
What, without us?

620
01:02:48,626 --> 01:02:52,389
You can't go. We need you,
that's why we're here.

621
01:02:52,941 --> 01:02:55,081
Go, Fry, go!
Go, Fry, go!

622
01:02:55,702 --> 01:02:59,637
Go, Fry, go! Go, Fry, go!
Go, Fry, go!

623
01:03:10,234 --> 01:03:15,446
Queenie! Queenie! Here we come.
Queenie! Queenie! Here we come.

624
01:03:15,584 --> 01:03:19,105
- Three, two, one. Pilgrims!
Pilgrims!

625
01:03:19,347 --> 01:03:21,142
And once more over here.
Three, two, one.

626
01:03:21,280 --> 01:03:23,454
- Pilgrims!
Pilgrims!

627
01:03:23,765 --> 01:03:25,491
Everyone point to Harold
and shout, "Harold!"

628
01:03:25,629 --> 01:03:27,148
Harold!

629
01:03:27,286 --> 01:03:29,253
That's great. Give yourselves
a round of applause, everyone.

630
01:03:39,125 --> 01:03:41,507
Maureen. What brings you
all the way here?

631
01:03:42,508 --> 01:03:44,303
Rex and I just fancied a drive.

632
01:03:44,648 --> 01:03:45,960
Oh, Rex is here too?

633
01:03:46,615 --> 01:03:48,997
Yes, he's just gone to WH Smith.

634
01:03:49,135 --> 01:03:50,378
Oh.

635
01:03:53,968 --> 01:03:55,555
Don't suppose
you've got time for a cuppa?

636
01:03:56,280 --> 01:03:57,385
Yeah.

637
01:03:57,764 --> 01:03:59,421
There's so much choice.

638
01:04:00,112 --> 01:04:01,907
Are you sure you
don't mind paying, Maureen?

639
01:04:02,424 --> 01:04:03,736
What'll you have?

640
01:04:04,254 --> 01:04:06,635
A strawberry milkshake
and one of those, please.

641
01:04:07,257 --> 01:04:09,431
- And I'll have a coffee.
- Er, what kind?

642
01:04:10,847 --> 01:04:12,365
Just normal.

643
01:04:18,475 --> 01:04:20,891
Wait, you're that guy
off the news.

644
01:04:21,478 --> 01:04:22,720
The one who's walking.

645
01:04:22,859 --> 01:04:24,101
Yeah.

646
01:04:25,171 --> 01:04:26,552
Can you sign?

647
01:04:28,968 --> 01:04:30,314
Well...

648
01:04:37,632 --> 01:04:39,254
My mum thinks you're awesome.

649
01:04:48,160 --> 01:04:49,886
- That's nice.
- Lovely.

650
01:04:50,852 --> 01:04:52,440
- After you.
- No, no, don't.

651
01:04:54,994 --> 01:04:57,100
Do you often get recognised,
Harold?

652
01:04:57,238 --> 01:05:00,689
What gets me
is everyone's so nice.

653
01:05:01,311 --> 01:05:03,140
- Do you mind if I start?
- Go ahead.

654
01:05:08,525 --> 01:05:09,975
Where did you sleep last night?

655
01:05:10,803 --> 01:05:11,942
In a field.

656
01:05:14,393 --> 01:05:15,497
I don't smell?

657
01:05:15,773 --> 01:05:17,016
No.

658
01:05:18,604 --> 01:05:19,985
I washed in a stream.

659
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:23,333
But I don't have soap.
I don't have a razor either.

660
01:05:23,989 --> 01:05:25,576
Well, I guessed about the razor.

661
01:05:32,445 --> 01:05:36,277
I could get you some soap.
I think I passed a Body Shop.

662
01:05:36,415 --> 01:05:39,556
Thank you. I don't want
to travel with too much stuff.

663
01:05:39,694 --> 01:05:41,109
Of course.

664
01:05:46,425 --> 01:05:47,495
Oh.

665
01:05:50,049 --> 01:05:51,188
Here.

666
01:05:58,678 --> 01:06:00,266
I'm sorry.

667
01:06:04,029 --> 01:06:05,685
It's just seeing you
again and...

668
01:06:07,204 --> 01:06:08,309
you look so well.

669
01:06:10,207 --> 01:06:11,898
You look well too, Maureen.

670
01:06:13,141 --> 01:06:16,973
No, I don't Harold. I look like
someone who's left behind.

671
01:06:26,810 --> 01:06:28,053
I miss you.

672
01:06:31,504 --> 01:06:32,919
I wish you'd come home.

673
01:06:37,648 --> 01:06:39,064
I miss you too.

674
01:06:40,789 --> 01:06:44,690
But, Maureen, I've spent my life
not doing anything,

675
01:06:45,277 --> 01:06:46,933
and now at last, I am.

676
01:06:48,935 --> 01:06:50,592
I have to finish my walk.

677
01:06:52,111 --> 01:06:55,528
Queenie is waiting.
She believes in me. You see?

678
01:06:56,046 --> 01:06:59,739
Well, yes, I do see.
Of course I do. I-- I just...

679
01:07:02,535 --> 01:07:05,504
Harold,
I don't know where I fit in.

680
01:07:08,679 --> 01:07:11,406
I understand that
you're a pilgrim now

681
01:07:11,544 --> 01:07:13,960
and everything.
It's just that...

682
01:07:16,066 --> 01:07:18,655
I can't help thinking
about myself.

683
01:07:18,793 --> 01:07:20,795
I'm not as selfless as you,
I'm sorry.

684
01:07:22,107 --> 01:07:23,798
Anyone can do what I'm doing.

685
01:07:23,936 --> 01:07:25,420
But you have to let go.

686
01:07:25,558 --> 01:07:27,836
You have to let go of the things
you think you need.

687
01:07:34,843 --> 01:07:36,155
Got a dog now.

688
01:07:36,880 --> 01:07:39,676
Oh. I think he sort of has me.

689
01:07:45,371 --> 01:07:48,236
- David wanted a dog.
- I know.

690
01:08:04,873 --> 01:08:06,289
Maureen.

691
01:08:08,394 --> 01:08:09,395
I saw him.

692
01:08:16,333 --> 01:08:17,610
I think I saw him.

693
01:08:28,414 --> 01:08:29,657
I should go.

694
01:08:31,624 --> 01:08:35,697
You know you could walk with us.
You could do this too.

695
01:08:37,285 --> 01:08:38,562
I can't.

696
01:08:39,529 --> 01:08:41,117
I haven't got my things.

697
01:08:41,255 --> 01:08:42,739
You don't need your things.

698
01:08:42,877 --> 01:08:43,878
I do!

699
01:08:46,191 --> 01:08:47,502
I do need them.

700
01:08:59,549 --> 01:09:00,791
Oh, and um...

701
01:09:02,483 --> 01:09:03,622
Rex says hello.

702
01:09:05,658 --> 01:09:06,832
I brought you these.

703
01:09:09,938 --> 01:09:12,976
Unless pilgrims
don't use plasters.

704
01:09:13,873 --> 01:09:15,496
I love plasters.

705
01:09:18,671 --> 01:09:21,950
It was selfish of me
to ask you to give up your walk.

706
01:09:24,090 --> 01:09:25,230
Forgive me, Harold.

707
01:09:31,167 --> 01:09:32,996
I'm the one
who needs forgiveness.

708
01:09:35,964 --> 01:09:38,104
Harold Fry! He's our guy!

709
01:09:38,588 --> 01:09:41,694
Harold Fry! He's our guy!
Harold Fry!

710
01:10:16,902 --> 01:10:18,938
Harold Fry! He's our guy!

711
01:10:19,353 --> 01:10:21,527
Harold Fry! He's our guy!

712
01:10:21,838 --> 01:10:26,912
Harold Fry! He's our guy!
Harold Fry! He's our guy!

713
01:10:27,361 --> 01:10:29,984
Harold Fry! He's our guy!

714
01:10:41,202 --> 01:10:42,859
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

715
01:10:45,241 --> 01:10:46,897
- Have you got something?
- No.

716
01:10:47,967 --> 01:10:49,693
Have you taken something
out of my bag?

717
01:10:49,831 --> 01:10:50,901
No!

718
01:10:52,938 --> 01:10:55,492
- Is that a quartz?
- It's mine.

719
01:10:57,632 --> 01:10:59,151
Wilf, it isn't.

720
01:11:00,394 --> 01:11:01,981
That's for Queenie.
That's her present.

721
01:11:02,119 --> 01:11:04,950
- You can't take it.
- It fell out. You dropped it.

722
01:11:05,088 --> 01:11:06,814
I was helping you,
for God's sake!

723
01:11:12,923 --> 01:11:15,029
What? I get hay fever.

724
01:11:21,104 --> 01:11:23,451
Here, have it.
It's just a bit of glass.

725
01:11:26,730 --> 01:11:31,114
Wilf. Please don't take pills.

726
01:11:32,184 --> 01:11:34,013
The pills aren't good for you.

727
01:11:37,431 --> 01:11:38,708
It's just a bit of glass.

728
01:12:17,505 --> 01:12:18,541
Wilf?

729
01:12:19,576 --> 01:12:20,750
Wilf!

730
01:12:22,268 --> 01:12:23,615
Have you seen Wilf?

731
01:12:24,685 --> 01:12:25,858
Have you seen him?

732
01:12:27,170 --> 01:12:28,447
Wilf!

733
01:12:29,931 --> 01:12:31,623
Has anyone seen Wilf?

734
01:12:32,313 --> 01:12:33,797
Wilf!

He reminded me of my son.

742
01:13:26,885 --> 01:13:28,680
My son was so clever.

743
01:13:31,337 --> 01:13:33,029
He got into Cambridge.

744
01:13:37,309 --> 01:13:38,552
It didn't work out.

745
01:13:43,660 --> 01:13:44,868
He was out of his depth.

746
01:13:46,594 --> 01:13:47,906
He came home...

747
01:13:50,874 --> 01:13:55,327
but he had started
mixing alcohol with pills.

748
01:13:58,399 --> 01:14:00,401
He'd do anything
to be not like me.

749
01:14:06,407 --> 01:14:07,857
I didn't know what to say.

750
01:14:09,859 --> 01:14:11,170
I didn't know what to do.

751
01:14:17,867 --> 01:14:19,558
I used to talk about him
with Queenie.

752
01:14:23,389 --> 01:14:24,632
We often talked about him.

753
01:14:34,090 --> 01:14:36,299
We covered barely a mile today.

754
01:14:37,783 --> 01:14:39,302
Yesterday was worse.

755
01:14:45,170 --> 01:14:46,654
You were right, Harold.

756
01:14:49,243 --> 01:14:50,934
You have to leave us behind.

Go on.

774
01:17:53,116 --> 01:17:54,670
Not long now, Queenie.

775
01:18:02,091 --> 01:18:04,334
Excuse me.
Excuse me, aren't you...

776
01:18:04,472 --> 01:18:05,681
No, sorry.

777
01:20:06,249 --> 01:20:07,768
On we go.

778
01:20:12,600 --> 01:20:15,880
Dog? It's the last push.

779
01:23:04,393 --> 01:23:05,532
No.

780
01:23:06,395 --> 01:23:08,086
No. No!

781
01:23:09,122 --> 01:23:10,295
Where's David?

782
01:23:54,822 --> 01:23:58,516
<i>Harold, is that you?</i>
- I want to come home.

783
01:23:58,999 --> 01:24:02,416
You were right. I can't do this.

784
01:24:05,316 --> 01:24:08,284
<i>Where are you, Harold?</i>
- I don't know.

785
01:24:10,735 --> 01:24:12,288
<i>Well, do you know
where you've been?</i>

786
01:24:13,565 --> 01:24:15,326
I don't even know
what day it is.

787
01:24:16,706 --> 01:24:18,260
<i>It's Tuesday, Harold.</i>

788
01:24:19,709 --> 01:24:22,160
<i>You've been gone 62 days.</i>

789
01:24:24,404 --> 01:24:27,062
<i>Ask someone.</i>
- I can't.

790
01:24:28,373 --> 01:24:29,961
<i>People are kind.</i>

791
01:24:30,651 --> 01:24:34,069
<i>On the whole, people are kind.
Ask someone.</i>

792
01:24:35,587 --> 01:24:37,244
<i>I'm going to open the map.</i>

793
01:24:39,522 --> 01:24:40,799
Excuse me?

794
01:24:41,214 --> 01:24:42,836
Yes.
- Where am I?

795
01:24:43,388 --> 01:24:45,010
Adderstone.
- Where?

796
01:24:45,390 --> 01:24:46,667
Adderstone.

797
01:24:47,530 --> 01:24:48,842
Adderstone.

798
01:24:51,016 --> 01:24:53,674
<i>Well, wait.
Don't hang up.</i>

799
01:24:56,677 --> 01:24:58,093
<i>You're nearly there!</i>

800
01:24:59,370 --> 01:25:03,650
<i>Eighteen miles. That's nothing.
We can see it.</i>

801
01:25:05,617 --> 01:25:07,032
Who's with you?

802
01:25:08,241 --> 01:25:10,243
<i>Rex. We had supper.</i>

803
01:25:14,868 --> 01:25:16,318
I can't do it, Maureen.

804
01:25:20,011 --> 01:25:21,357
<i>Harold.</i>

805
01:25:24,084 --> 01:25:27,467
<i>Before Queenie left,
she came here.</i>

806
01:25:29,710 --> 01:25:31,264
<i>She asked me to tell you</i>

807
01:25:31,919 --> 01:25:34,198
<i>not to blame yourself
for what happened.</i>

808
01:25:35,958 --> 01:25:37,304
<i>You were her friend.</i>

809
01:25:40,721 --> 01:25:44,208
<i>But I couldn't bear for you
to have comfort when I had none.</i>

810
01:25:47,659 --> 01:25:49,627
<i>I didn't give you her message.</i>

811
01:25:53,078 --> 01:25:54,287
Oh.

812
01:26:10,820 --> 01:26:12,167
You told him?

813
01:26:13,444 --> 01:26:14,755
If he stops now,

814
01:26:16,481 --> 01:26:17,931
he'll never forgive himself.

815
01:27:49,850 --> 01:27:52,128
Please could I ask
for a glass of water?

816
01:28:03,381 --> 01:28:04,624
- Here.
- Thank you.

817
01:28:05,556 --> 01:28:06,902
Be quick.

818
01:28:14,323 --> 01:28:16,498
Do you think someone
might lend me a comb?

819
01:28:17,947 --> 01:28:19,155
And a razor.

820
01:28:20,225 --> 01:28:21,606
Could you not read?

821
01:28:22,297 --> 01:28:23,884
I'm gonna have
to ask you to leave,

822
01:28:24,022 --> 01:28:25,300
or I'll call the police.

823
01:28:27,923 --> 01:28:30,822
- Of course.

824
01:29:02,267 --> 01:29:03,717
I want my son.

825
01:29:07,894 --> 01:29:09,344
I want him.

826
01:29:10,275 --> 01:29:13,209
Your son? Where is he?

827
01:29:16,661 --> 01:29:20,458
Do you see your son here?
Is he in Berwick-upon-Tweed?

828
01:29:22,080 --> 01:29:24,151
Excuse me, sir.

829
01:29:24,289 --> 01:29:26,464
Are you the gentleman
who's been walking?

830
01:29:29,467 --> 01:29:31,469
Well, who's your son, now?
What's his name?

831
01:29:32,677 --> 01:29:34,127
Can I help you look?

832
01:29:35,542 --> 01:29:36,854
His name's...

833
01:29:43,378 --> 01:29:45,034
He's my son.

834
01:30:03,846 --> 01:30:05,503
<i>Dear girl in the garage,</i>

835
01:30:07,229 --> 01:30:09,093
<i>I owe you the full story.</i>

836
01:30:11,095 --> 01:30:14,374
<i>Twenty-five years ago,
I buried my son.</i>

837
01:30:15,686 --> 01:30:18,033
<i>It is not something
a father should have to do.</i>

838
01:30:19,206 --> 01:30:20,587
<i>He hanged himself.</i>

839
01:30:24,349 --> 01:30:26,041
<i>My wife took it terribly.</i>

840
01:30:27,525 --> 01:30:29,493
<i>It is too much
for a mother to bear.</i>

841
01:30:32,875 --> 01:30:34,325
<i>We fought for a time.</i>

842
01:30:36,085 --> 01:30:37,639
<i>And then we stopped talking.</i>

843
01:30:38,881 --> 01:30:40,538
Call yourself a man!

844
01:30:41,574 --> 01:30:44,473
You never did anything!
You never held him!

845
01:30:45,405 --> 01:30:47,856
You couldn't even say goodbye!

846
01:30:50,203 --> 01:30:53,862
<i>I couldn't forgive myself.
I drank too much.</i>

847
01:30:55,139 --> 01:30:57,831
<i>But that wasn't enough,
so I did something stupid.</i>

848
01:31:04,389 --> 01:31:06,322
<i>All I wanted
was to be punished.</i>

849
01:31:26,308 --> 01:31:30,208
<i>Queenie was my friend.
She knew about my son.</i>

850
01:31:31,002 --> 01:31:34,592
<i>She took the blame for what
I had done to protect me</i>

851
01:31:35,248 --> 01:31:36,491
<i>and got fired.</i>

852
01:31:38,147 --> 01:31:39,632
<i>I let it happen.</i>

853
01:31:42,117 --> 01:31:43,601
<i>People think I'm walking</i>

854
01:31:43,739 --> 01:31:45,707
<i>because there was a romance
between Queenie and myself,</i>

855
01:31:45,845 --> 01:31:47,191
<i>but it isn't true.</i>

856
01:31:48,468 --> 01:31:50,850
<i>I'm walking because
she saved me once,</i>

857
01:31:52,161 --> 01:31:53,438
<i>and I did nothing.</i>

858
01:31:55,993 --> 01:31:57,995
<i>And this is why
I'm writing to you now.</i>

859
01:31:59,272 --> 01:32:03,069
<i>I want you to know how much you
helped me all those weeks ago</i>

860
01:32:03,794 --> 01:32:06,003
<i>when you told me about
your faith and your aunt,</i>

861
01:32:07,004 --> 01:32:09,731
<i>though I fear my courage
has never matched yours.</i>

862
01:32:11,318 --> 01:32:15,115
<i>With best wishes
and my humble thanks, Harold,</i>

863
01:32:15,875 --> 01:32:17,359
<i>brackets Fry.</i>

864
01:32:21,708 --> 01:32:23,020
Thank you.

865
01:32:27,334 --> 01:32:28,853
Is he okay?

866
01:32:31,062 --> 01:32:32,236
I don't know.

867
01:32:32,650 --> 01:32:33,927
Oh, God.

868
01:32:36,136 --> 01:32:37,413
I feel such a fraud.

869
01:32:39,243 --> 01:32:42,833
Why?
You inspired his journey.

870
01:32:43,834 --> 01:32:46,975
- It all happened because of you.
- But that's just it.

871
01:32:49,529 --> 01:32:52,808
My aunt passed.
She passed years ago.

872
01:32:55,984 --> 01:32:57,088
She's dead?

873
01:32:58,193 --> 01:32:59,884
I wish I'd never said anything.

874
01:33:02,024 --> 01:33:06,960
But what about your faith?
I thought your faith saved her.

875
01:33:07,892 --> 01:33:09,376
I thought that was the point.

876
01:33:09,929 --> 01:33:11,378
How could I do that?

877
01:33:13,588 --> 01:33:14,968
She was dying.

878
01:33:19,766 --> 01:33:21,078
Of course.

879
01:33:29,534 --> 01:33:30,846
Oh, Harold.

880
01:33:55,181 --> 01:33:56,631
I'm Harold Fry.

881
01:33:57,010 --> 01:33:59,806
I've walked a very long way
to save Queenie Hennessy.

882
01:34:03,741 --> 01:34:06,295
Welcome, Harold Fry.

883
01:34:27,178 --> 01:34:30,699
- Queenie? We have a visitor.

884
01:34:35,359 --> 01:34:37,982
Queenie is confused
and in some pain,

885
01:34:38,362 --> 01:34:41,227
but she waited,
as you said she should.

886
01:34:42,815 --> 01:34:45,610
She can't speak,
but she can hear.

887
01:34:47,992 --> 01:34:49,269
Why can't she speak?

888
01:34:50,650 --> 01:34:54,619
Take the weight off your feet.
You must be exhausted.

889
01:35:14,709 --> 01:35:16,296
Hello, Queenie.

890
01:35:18,402 --> 01:35:21,405
It's Harold. Harold Fry.

891
01:35:25,858 --> 01:35:27,618
I must say,
you're doing very well.

892
01:35:30,828 --> 01:35:32,105
Maureen, I...

893
01:35:33,831 --> 01:35:37,352
I don't know if you remember
my wife, Maureen,

894
01:35:39,734 --> 01:35:41,183
She sends her regards.

895
01:35:46,257 --> 01:35:47,569
I brought you a souvenir.

896
01:35:49,260 --> 01:35:52,367
It's here. It's here somewhere.

897
01:35:53,713 --> 01:35:55,197
I just need to find it.

898
01:35:57,544 --> 01:35:59,270
Ah! Here we go.

899
01:36:04,310 --> 01:36:05,518
See?

900
01:36:09,418 --> 01:36:11,213
I can put it up for you
if you'd like.

901
01:36:14,009 --> 01:36:15,908
I can hang it
up in the window, maybe.

902
01:36:25,780 --> 01:36:27,022
There we go.

903
01:36:58,467 --> 01:36:59,744
Oh, Queenie.

904
01:37:33,433 --> 01:37:34,883
Hello, stranger.

905
01:37:41,303 --> 01:37:42,408
Do you mind if I...

906
01:37:43,202 --> 01:37:44,859
- If I...?
- Sure.

907
01:38:01,220 --> 01:38:03,567
How far do you think
those waves have travelled?

908
01:38:06,363 --> 01:38:08,641
All that way,
just to finish here.

909
01:38:10,367 --> 01:38:11,540
I don't know.

910
01:38:16,787 --> 01:38:18,375
Harold, what I did was wrong.

911
01:38:20,204 --> 01:38:21,412
I'm sorry.

912
01:38:26,831 --> 01:38:28,109
Did you see her?

913
01:38:29,213 --> 01:38:30,456
I did.

914
01:38:31,664 --> 01:38:33,666
- Did you talk?
- Talk?

915
01:38:34,701 --> 01:38:36,462
Yes, what did you say?

916
01:38:40,086 --> 01:38:43,193
Not much.
I didn't stay long.

917
01:38:49,682 --> 01:38:50,925
What did I think?

918
01:38:53,410 --> 01:38:56,585
I'd travel the length of England
to save a woman from dying?

919
01:39:00,865 --> 01:39:02,937
I couldn't even save my own son.

920
01:39:13,740 --> 01:39:15,087
You dear man.

921
01:39:16,536 --> 01:39:18,849
You got up,
you went out into the world.

922
01:39:20,644 --> 01:39:22,577
In blind faith, you did it.

923
01:39:24,475 --> 01:39:26,063
And if trying to find your way

924
01:39:26,201 --> 01:39:27,823
when you don't even know
you can get there

925
01:39:27,962 --> 01:39:31,482
isn't a miracle,
I don't know what is.

926
01:39:37,937 --> 01:39:39,904
I love you, Harold Fry.

927
01:39:43,080 --> 01:39:44,564
That's what you did.

928
01:41:25,251 --> 01:41:26,666
Are you all right, Harold?

929
01:41:28,082 --> 01:41:29,186
Yes, Maureen.

930
01:41:33,501 --> 01:41:34,743
