这说不通
It doesn't make sense

5
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:49,410
我不明白怎么会发生这样的事
I don't understand how something like this happened

6
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:53,010
我不知道该怎么办

那曾是我全部的人生 现在却消失了
This has been my whole life, and now it's gone

我不知道该怎么办

我只熟知彭德尔顿产业

现在全都被夺走了
And now it's all been taken away

11
00:01:05,350 --> 00:01:09,560
当别人看见了我的弱点 我会把那个弱点化为力量
When someone sees a weakness in me, I turn that weakness into a strength

12
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:17,280
丹妮卡，你真坚强

13
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:21,780
我做不出这样的事
I don't think I could do anything like this

14
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:24,780
克拉琳达，你可以去争取那块地
You can imagine changing your life...

15
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:27,460
来改变你的生活
by fighting for the deed to the land, Clarinda

16
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:31,380
只要巴塞洛缪离世
Which is only possible if Bartholomew is no longer living

17
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:37,750
你永远也不会再得到那块地
You will never get the deed to the land again

18
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,840
我永远也不会准许

19
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:42,230
把枪放下，你这个傻瓜
Put down that gun, you silly girl

20
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:45,180
小心点，巴塞洛缪

00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:56,070
没错
it's true

26
00:01:56,110 --> 00:01:57,190
我为你而来
I'm here for you

27
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:02,870
根据一名勇敢女子的真实故事改编

28
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:06,540
一名特别的女子

29
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:17,540
这是乔伊的故事 由我，她的外婆来讲讲
This is the story of Joy, as told by me, her grandmother

30

每个人都从梦想中的生活开始
Everybody starts out with some kind of dream of what life will be

31
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,900
鲁迪公车和货车公司

32
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:34,360
乔伊的梦想从她爸爸经营的 这家修车厂开始

我的脚在颤抖
While shivering in my shoes

38
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:59,680
我才不在乎

也就是我女儿

00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:22,070
外婆，就是我

她在房间里做了好多漂亮的东西

真是神奇
Magic

48
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,140
有些人很喜欢造东西
Some people love to make things

49
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:49,090
他们有耐心，能集中精神 用双手解决问题
They have the patience and the focus to figure it out with their hands

50
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:53,180
乔伊就是那样喜欢造东西的人
Joy was one of those people who rejoiced in making things

51
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:57,240
我打开通向大片草地的大门
And I open the gate to the big g reen meadow

52
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:00,370
我走进森林
And I went into the forest

53
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:03,270
在那我克服了很多危险
And there, I conquered many dangers

54
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:06,190
一头狼
A wolf...

55
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:08,530
和其他吓人的东西
and other scary things

56
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:11,630
然后我开始造我自己的房子
And then I started to build my very own house...

57
00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:13,540
我会住在那里
where I would live...

58
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:16,830
然后创造很多美好的东西 让全世界
and make wonderful creations for all the world...

59
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,680
都看到和拥有

60
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:20,840
或者给住在森林那边
And maybe for the prince and princess...

61
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,590
城堡里的王子和公主
who lived across the forest, in the castle

62
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:24,630
看见吗？
See?

63
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:27,170
他们相爱着
And they were in love

64
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:28,840
因为我造的东西
And maybe they'd invite me over...

65
00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:30,770
他们可能会邀请我去做客
because of the things that I made

66
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:35,610
你需要一个帅气的王子 那是你需要的，一个王子
You need a handsome prince That's what you need A prince

67
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:39,650
不，我不需要王子
No, I don't need a prince

68
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:42,770
这是超能力，我不需要王子
This is a special power I don't need a prince

69
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:49,620
我的女儿泰瑞与丈夫分居 独自待在房间里
My daughter Terry is separated, and alone in her room...

70
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:51,500
看肥皂剧
watching soap operas

71
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:52,830
克拉琳达，你可以去争取那块地
You can imagine changing your life...

72
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:55,790
来改变你的生活
by fighting for the deed to the land, Clarinda

73
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:59,010
我有样东西给你
I have something for you

74
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,500
哦，丹妮卡
Oh, Danica...

75
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:02,720
你真坚强
You're so strong

76
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:05,180
我做不出这样的事
I don't think I could ever do something like this

77
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:12,600
我一直觉得我该鼓励她
I always felt it was for me to encourage her

78
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:15,220
所以我说
So I said...

79
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:20,940
你会长成一名坚强、睿智的聪明女子
You are goi ng to g row up and be a strong, smart young woman...

80
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:26,480
去上学，遇到一个好男人 有自己漂亮的孩子们
go to school, meet a fine young man, have beautiful children of your own...

81
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:32,210
创造出像你房间里那些 美好的东西来
and you're gonna build wonderful things that you do in your room

82
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,070
好吗？
Okay?

83
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,590
这个女孩的梦想如何了？
What happened to this girl's dreams?

84
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,210
看看吧
Watch this

85
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:40,340
妈妈，我找不到工牌的挂绳了
Mother, I can't find my lanyard for work

86
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:42,550
没有它他们不会让我通过机场的安检
They're not gonna let me through airport security without it

87
00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:45,300
乔伊，找不到你的挂绳了？ 我能帮你吗？
Joy, you can't find your lanyard? Can I help you?

88
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:46,290
不用，我…
No, but I...

89
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:47,500
亲爱的，听着
Honey, listen

90
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:51,880
我知道生活并不像 我们多次谈过的那样，亲爱的
I know life hasn't gone as we discussed many times, sweetheart

91
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:54,680
而你的人生也不是刚刚开始
And you don't exactly have your whole life ahead of you...

92
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:57,480
但仍有很长的一段路
but you still have a good portion of it, anyway

93
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,440
面包总会有的
Hope springs eternal

94
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:03,320
–谢了，外婆 –不谢
- Thanks, Mimi - Sure

95
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,950
妈妈，看我找到了什么
Mother, look what I did find

96
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,900
那是什么？
What is that?

97
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:10,830
你怎么能不知道？
How can you ask what this is?

98
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:14,170
我高中时发明的狗项圈
The dog collar I invented in high school

99
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,160
记不记得米茨被卡住几次？
Remember Mitzy choked a couple of times?

100
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:18,710
所以我发明了一个可快速解开的狗项圈
So I invented a dog collar with a quick release...

101
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:19,960
这样狗永远也不会被卡住
so that a dog would never choke...

102
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,670
我还在上面贴了反光贴 而且它还是个防跳蚤项圈
and I covered it with reflective tape, plus it's a flea collar

103
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:26,540
如果你帮我申请了专利或请个律师
I probably wouldn't be late to this job I'm going to...

104
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:28,300
可能我就不用帮人打工了
if you'd gotten me a patent or a lawyer

105
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:31,340
实干家乔伊 你总是在造各种东西，亲爱的
Joy the doer, Joy the doer You were always doing things, honey

106
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:33,730
我怎能每一样都记住呢？
How could I be expected to remember everything?

107
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:36,590
现在哈茨公司拥有了这个专利权
Now the Hartz company has the patent to that collar

108
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:38,560
我不知道怎么申请专利
I don't know how to get a patent

109
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,860
那是什么味道？
What is that smell?

110
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:43,940
这下面怎么会有酸奶，妈妈？
How did you get yogurt down here, Mother?

111
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:46,770
我也在想那是什么味道呢
I was wondering what that odor was

112
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:48,950
已经开始发霉了
It's starting to mold for Pete's sake

113
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:53,200
是的，因为我不能让生活就这样弃我而去
Yes, I am, because I feel like I cannot have the life bled out of me this way

114
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:56,200
乔伊，看谁回来了，看谁回来了！
Joy, look who's back Look who's back!

115
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:58,790
没错，巴塞洛缪回来了
Yes, Bartholomew is back

116
00:06:58,830 --> 00:06:59,660
不，不
No, no

117
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:00,960
我以为巴塞洛缪已经死了
I thought Bartholomew was dead?

118
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,090
我是个鬼魂
And I'm a ghost

119
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:04,130
他化作力量更强的鬼魂回来了
He came back as a ghost with even greater powers

120
00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:05,340
鬼魂，走开！
Ghost, you go away!

121
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:07,430
我现在力量更强了
My powers are even greater now

122
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:09,420
我做不到，这怎么可能？
I cannot handle this How is this possible?

123
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:11,130
别靠近他
Stay away from him

124
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:13,100
克拉琳达，即使在坟墓里
Clarinda, you don't know what a ghost can do to you!

125
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:14,600
你也不知道鬼魂能把你怎么样！
Even from beyond the grave

126
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:18,300
外婆会带你去参加生日会，好吧？
Grandma's gonna take you to the birthday party, okay?

127
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:19,260
只要五分钟
Five minutes

128
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:23,490
嗨，你们来这干什么？
Hi What are you doing here?

129
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,850
我来把他还给你，我不想要了
I'm returning him to you I don't want him anymore

130
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:26,950
什么？
What?

131
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:28,820
他精神不正常
He's damaged

132
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:30,320
他无处可去
He has no place else to go

133
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,700
他在我的房子里住了两年了
He's been living in my house for two years

134
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:34,790
爸爸，我真抱歉
Dad, I'm so sorry

135
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:37,420
但你知道，托尼住在地下室
But you know, Tony's living in the basement

136
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:39,570
你前夫不该住在你的地下室
Your ex-husband shouldn't be living in your basement

137
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:41,580
离婚了还这样不合适
That's not the proper way to be divorced

138
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:44,790
好吧，我不知道该让你住哪里
Okay I don't know where I'm gonna put you

139
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,550
爸爸，别进去，妈妈在里面
Dad, don't go in there Mom's in there

140
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:50,340
你可以跟他在一起了，泰瑞 我不想了
You can have him back, Terry I don't want him anymore

141
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:52,130
跟莎伦在一起有什么好的，鲁迪？
What was so much better about being with Sharon, Rudy?

142
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:53,430
爸爸，别回答
Dad, don't answer that

143
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:55,520
我们能一起去大都会艺术博物馆
We went to the Metropolitan Museum of Art

144
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:58,130
–你喜欢博物馆什么？ –我喜欢什么？我来告诉你
- What did you like at the museum? - What did I like? I'll tell you what I like

145
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:02,180
我喜欢古老的罗马雕像、中世纪的盔甲

伊特鲁里亚人的珠宝

147
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:06,810
–博物馆里全是灰尘和死物 –我喜欢去那个咖啡馆
- Museums are full of dust and death - I like going to the café...

148
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:08,990
喝杯浓咖啡，吃个好吃的意式热三明治
having an espresso, a nice panini, that's what I like

149
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:11,280
你在棺材里吃意式热三明治，鲁迪
You had a panini in a coffin, Rudy

150
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:14,330
–一个布满灰尘、无趣的棺材，恶心 –那你还问？
- A dusty, boring coffin Yuck - Then why'd you ask me?

151
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,530
你是个疯子吗？
What are you, a crazy person?

152
00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:17,320
我就像是在跟一个疯子讲话
It's like having a conversation with an insane asylum person

153
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:18,830
还有什么，杰克船长？ 还有什么好看的？
What else, Captain Jack? What else was so great?

154
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:20,540
你叫我杰克船长，好吧
Captain Jack, you're calling me Okay

155
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:21,880
对，杰克船长，一个大坏蛋
Yes, you're Captain Jack, the flying jackass

156
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:23,910
是的，你知道你是谁吗？ 你就像是泄漏的煤气
Yeah, and you know what you are? You're like a gas leak

157
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,710
–闻不到、看不到… –我不是泄漏的煤气
- We don't smell you, we don't see you... - I am not a gas leak!

158
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:27,330
–但能慢慢地把我们都杀了 –你把那话收回
- But you're killing us all silently - You take that back...

159
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:28,510
告诉我你还跟莎伦做过什么！
and tell me what else you did with Sharon!

160
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:30,010
你就是个妖怪
You creature from the Black Lagoon

161
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:31,640
住嘴！你们俩都别说了
No! This conversation is over

162
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:33,630
–我要走了，祝你好运 –天，又这样
- I'm leaving Good luck - Oh, my God Here it goes

163
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,640
小心，乔伊，他要发飙了！
Watch out, Joy He's gonna snap!

164
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:37,890
你想让我发飙，你的惯用伎俩，你…
Please You want me to snap That's your whole routine You...

165
00:08:37,930 --> 00:08:39,060
保护瓷器！

166
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:41,230
–嘿，泰瑞，你喜欢这个吗？ –爸爸，不要！
- Hey, Terry, you like this? - Dad, no!

167
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:42,810
这样发飙如何？
How's this for snapping?

168
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:44,600
–不要！ –这样如何？
- No! No - How's this?

169
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:47,400
这就是发飙！
This is snapping!

170
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,900
–爸爸！住手！ –他心理失常，乔伊！
- Dad! Stop! - He's disturbed, Joy!

171
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:51,400
他是个心理失常的人！
He's a disturbed man!

172
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,310
–我心理失常？ –他是个神经病！
- I'm disturbed? - He's a damaged man!

173
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,150
你说的对，我心理失常
You're right, I am disturbed

174
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,620
是你让我心理失常的
You're the great disturber!

175
00:08:57,570 --> 00:08:58,700
对不起，亲爱的
I'm sorry, honey

176
00:08:58,740 --> 00:08:59,900
我不希望这样的
I don't like this

177
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:01,660
你不该看见这样的事
You're not supposed to see this kind of thing

178
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:03,950
我非常非常抱歉，我诚意道歉

- You broke things again - He did break stuff

I did break some things, but Grandma was wrong

190
00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:32,030

So I was a little wrong, but she was really wrong

191

莎伦把他带回来了

But I wasn't stupid enough to get into a bad marriage and have a couple of kids

260
00:12:58,150 --> 00:13:01,110
他为何不把发票发过来？ 把发票发过来，我就会付他钱

267
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:17,500
旁边的练枪场影响很大

他们在自己的地盘练

那是他们的地方，警察也管不了

272
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:27,270

273
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:28,630
我觉得一定没好处
I don't think it's helping

274
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:32,150
如果你想帮忙 为何你不来这管理这个地方？
Well, if you wanna help, why don't you come here and manage this place?

275
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:35,010

Aunt Peggy got it for me

400
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,040
你记得吗？
Do you remember?

401
00:18:49,370 --> 00:18:50,750
佩吉跟我

402
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:52,790
乔伊一半的时间跟我们过
Joy spends half the time with us

403
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,130
我们会带走她的纸森林
We'll take her paper forest

404
00:18:55,170 --> 00:18:57,460
那是乔伊的宝贝 该放在这座房子里
That's Joy's special thing, and it belongs in this house

405
00:18:57,510 --> 00:18:58,600
不，我…
No, I...

406
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:11,940
乔伊

407
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:14,950
乔伊，醒醒！

408
00:19:15,610 --> 00:19:17,410
有人在按门铃
Someone's been ringing the doorbell

409
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:32,630
杰基！
Jackie!

410
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:34,220
哦，谢天谢地！是你
Oh, thank God! It's you

411
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:37,750
怎么了？我担心你，我好久见不到你了
What happened? I'm worried about you I don't see you any more

412
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,550
你没来参加家长会
You don't come to the PTA

413
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:44,100
你记得我妈妈在水池洗梳子 头发总是把水管堵住吗？
You know how my mom's always clogging the sink with her hair from the brushes?

414
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:45,520
她房间的水管？
With the pipes in her room?

415
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:47,560
对，她又这么做了
Yeah She did it again

416
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:48,400
又一次？
Again?

417
00:19:48,430 --> 00:19:50,810
是啊，我不得不在地板上凿开一个洞
Yes, and I had to bash open a hole in the floor

418
00:19:50,850 --> 00:19:54,730
我妈妈房间的地板上有一个大洞 我已经没钱了
There's a huge hole in the floor of my mother's room and I'm broke

419
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:59,990
我爸爸工作得很努力 但他最近也诸事不顺
My father works hard He's had some bad breaks

420
00:20:02,490 --> 00:20:05,870
我希望他能找个女朋友 那样他就能搬出地下室
I hope he gets another girlfriend, and he'll move out of the basement

421
00:20:06,290 --> 00:20:07,830
他现在跟托尼一起住在地下室？
He's in the basement with Tony?

422
00:20:07,870 --> 00:20:10,540
是的，他们互相憎恶
Yes And they hate each other

423
00:20:11,170 --> 00:20:12,500
对
Yes

424
00:20:13,290 --> 00:20:15,790
简直糟透了，他们不停地吵架
It's a disaster They won't stop fighting

425
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:18,500
我不知道
I don't know

426
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:22,590
你怎么样？家里人怎么样？ 大家都怎么样？
But how are you? How's the family? How is everybody?

427
00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:23,710
大家都还好
Everybody's okay

428
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:24,960
工作呢？
How's work?

429
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,940
我的工作可有可无
My job, I could take it or leave it

430
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:31,110
我们怎么了，杰基？
What happened to us, Jackie?

431
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:33,770
我们曾经梦想过的事情
All the things that we used to dream about

432
00:20:33,810 --> 00:20:36,940
我觉得那离我们越来越远
I feel like they just keep getting farther and farther away

433
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:39,900
记得最初的那场晚会吗？

乐队在演奏

435
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:43,910
一切都是那么令人兴奋
Everything was so exciting

436
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:47,490
乔伊，你来了！

445

“不是这样玩的”

你在跳舞，很好

00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:00,200
是的，我要成为下一个汤姆琼斯
Yeah I'm gonna be the next Tom Jones

468
00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:03,520
野心好大，不过只有一个汤姆琼斯
That's a big ambition There's only one Tom Jones

469
00:22:03,570 --> 00:22:07,080
我知道，但你不能被现实吓倒
I know, but you can't let the practical get you down

470
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:10,160
你要不断地追逐你所爱的事
You gotta keep going to what you love

471
00:22:10,910 --> 00:22:12,210
没错
That's true

472
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,870
那是我爸爸教我的

473
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:18,590
你呢？

我发明了一个狗项圈，想要申请专利 但可能实现不了
I invented a dog collar that I want to get patented, but I don't think it ever will

475
00:22:28,470 --> 00:22:31,600
我在高中是最优等生

我考上了波士顿的大学

可能你的梦想只是暂停一下而已

481
00:22:49,950 --> 00:22:51,040
不是吗？
No?

482
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:53,780
这么说真不错
That's a nice way of putting it

483
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:55,790
一些愚蠢的事
This song is going to be in the town musical

484
00:22:55,830 --> 00:22:56,920
这首歌会用在镇子上的音乐剧中

485
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,630
我们该一起来唱
We should sing it together

486
00:22:58,870 --> 00:23:02,500
我知道我站在那 等着你有时间
I know I stand in line Until you think you have the time

487
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:05,460
来与我共度夜晚

00:23:07,930 --> 00:23:09,180
好，一起来

–不 –好
- No - Okay

491
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:12,880
如果我们去某处跳舞
And if we go someplace to dance

492
00:23:12,930 --> 00:23:15,980
我知道会有一线机会 你不会离开我
I know that there's a chance You won't be leaving with me

493
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:18,770
他在我孙女最低落的时候 给她带来了一缕阳光
He gave my girl a spring in her step, just when she needed it

494
00:23:18,810 --> 00:23:20,970
我们要做什么？托尼
What are we doing? T ony

495
00:23:21,310 --> 00:23:24,640
他让她来演音乐剧 她以前从未演过
He got her to do the musical, something she never would have done

496
00:23:35,450 --> 00:23:39,410
我知道我站在那 等着你有时间
I know I stand in line Until you think you have the time

497
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:42,760
来与我共度夜晚

你不会离开我
You won't be leaving with me

500
00:23:53,970 --> 00:24:00,970
然后我们去一个安静的地方 喝上一两杯
And afterwards we drop into a quiet little place And have a drink or two

501
00:24:03,270 --> 00:24:10,270
然后我会说些蠢话，比如“我爱你”
And then I go and spoil it all By saying something stupid like "I love you"

502
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:16,410
我能从你的眼中看出 你讨厌这不变的古老的谎言
I can see it in your eyes That you despise the same old lies

503
00:24:16,450 --> 00:24:19,700
你昨晚才听过

你可以嫁给任何人

You could have married a doctor, a lawyer, a nice man instead of this...

507
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:30,550
我都不知道该怎么叫他
I don't even know what to call this guy

508
00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:32,250
你真的要现在来谈这事吗？
Are you seriously talking about this right now?

509
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:38,550
为时未晚

515
00:25:09,050 --> 00:25:10,470
我跟我太太结婚…

516
00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:11,800
现在我要发言

517
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:13,380
他还没说完，爸爸
He wasn't finished, Dad

518
00:25:13,430 --> 00:25:14,890
现在他说完了
He's finished now

519
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:17,170
我有两次失败的婚姻

I was married to Joy's mother for 18 miserable fucking years

523
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:32,980
爸爸！太刻薄了！坐下！
Dad! That's just mean! Sit down!

524
00:25:33,030 --> 00:25:34,370
但我走出来了

525

我最终遇见了我生命中的阳光，莎伦

离婚酒杯
The divorce glass

534
00:25:52,710 --> 00:25:53,840
我敬大家
Salud

535
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:56,210
我给这对新人一半的成功机会
I give these kids 50-50 odds

536
00:25:56,970 --> 00:25:59,730
敬大家，祝你们玩得开心
Salud, everybody Have a good time

537
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:01,980
托尼，醒醒！
Tony, wake up!

538
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:05,360
求你了！克里斯蒂还没吃饭 汤米要换尿布
Please! Cristy hasn't eaten, Tommy needs to be changed

539
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:09,060
哦，克里斯蒂，你在干什么？
Oh, Cristy What are you doing?

540
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:11,740
–起来，我刚跟你老板说你会去上班！ –你为何要撒谎？
- Get up I just told your boss you're going to work! - But what did you lie for?

541
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:13,950
–因为你又快要丢掉一份工作了！ –不行，亲爱的，我病了！
- Because you're gonna lose another job! - No, honey, I'm sick!

542
00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:15,870
你没病，你是宿醉！
You're not sick, you're hungover!

543
00:26:16,110 --> 00:26:18,490
那不是我！我是名歌手 那才是我要做的！
That's not who I am! I'm a singer, that's what I do!

544
00:26:18,530 --> 00:26:20,070
你唱歌赚不了钱！
You're not making any money singing!

545
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:22,000
现在马上上车去上班！
Get in your car right now and go get your job!

546
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:24,000
你想把我变成另一个人！
You're trying to turn me into someone I'm not!

547
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:26,500
我受不了了！ 我受不了了，托尼！
I can't do this! I can't do this, Tony!

548
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:28,050
我快要疯了！
I am losing my mind!

549
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:36,260
我不想像我父母一样
I don't wanna end up like my family

550
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:00,780
时光飞逝
Time moves forward

551
00:27:01,410 --> 00:27:03,290
时光倒流
Time moves backwards

552
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:04,330
时光静止
Time stands still

553
00:27:17,590 --> 00:27:19,630
我跟我的简介一致还是不如我的简介？
Do I live up to my profile or do I fall short?

554
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:22,850
开玩笑吧？你太棒了，就像 加了朗姆酒的香蕉弗朗焙
Are you kidding? You're a banana flambé with extra rum

555
00:27:23,890 --> 00:27:26,190
你让我非常开心，就像光速飞到月球
You're a trip to the moon on gossamer wings

556
00:27:26,230 --> 00:27:29,520
哇！你好有诗意、好浪漫
Wow! You're so poetic and romantic

557
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:30,520
是真的！
It's true!

558
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:32,390
正如我死去的丈夫莫里斯
Just like my late Morris

559
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:36,610
莫里斯，他是美国人，你是意大利人 你的原名是什么？
Morris Now, he was American and you're Italian, and your name originated how?

560
00:27:36,650 --> 00:27:38,980
我的意大利名叫吉尔特鲁得
My name My Italian name is Geltrude

561
00:27:39,030 --> 00:27:39,870
吉尔特鲁得
Geltrude

562
00:27:39,910 --> 00:27:43,540
然后他叫我“特鲁得” 后来就更美国化，叫“特鲁迪”了
And then he called me "Trude," and then became more American "Trudy"

563
00:27:44,030 --> 00:27:44,860
特鲁迪
Trudy

564
00:27:44,910 --> 00:27:49,420
你带上所有家人来我前夫的船上玩吧？
Why don't you come with your entire family, on my late Morris' boat?

565
00:27:50,290 --> 00:27:52,250
带上孩子们、孙子们
Bring the children, bring the grandchildren

566
00:27:52,290 --> 00:27:53,710
摩托艇类的？
Like a motorboat?

567
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:55,540
不，是艘近17米长的帆船
No, no, it's a sailboat 55 feet

568
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:57,680
–哇，好大 –是的
- Wow That's big That is big - Yeah Yeah

569
00:27:57,710 --> 00:27:59,040
好，我很乐意
Yeah, I would love to

570
00:27:59,090 --> 00:28:01,170
我们会带些好吃的、好喝的，一定会很棒
We'd bring some nice food, something to drink, that would be great

571
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:06,270
好，但不要带红酒 否则会弄脏茶树木甲板
Yeah, but not red wine, because it might stain the teakwood deck

572
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:07,560
很珍贵的
It's very precious

573
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,270
好，明白，不要带红酒
Okay, understood No red wine

574
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:11,400
我带了红酒！
I got the red wine!

575
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:13,610
不，对不起，你不能带红酒上船
No, no, no, I'm sorry, you can't have red wine on the boat

576
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:15,780
不能带红酒，托尼
No red wine, Tony No red wine

577
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:17,530
为何？是很好的红酒！
Why? It's a beautiful wine!

578
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:19,870
为何大歌星会来这？谁邀请他的？
What's Tom Jones doing here anyway? Who invited him?

579
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:21,270
他来帮我看孩子
He's here to help me with the kids

580
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:23,330
我带了佩吉来帮忙
I brought Peggy to help

581
00:28:23,370 --> 00:28:25,080
佩吉对我的孩子说我的坏话，所以…
Peggy says mean things about me to my children, so...

582
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,580
我也说了你的好话
I say nice things about you, too

583
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:27,750
这是很好的酒
It's a beautiful wine

584
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:28,880
你也有口音！
You have an accent, too!

585
00:28:28,910 --> 00:28:29,870
是的
Yes

586
00:28:29,910 --> 00:28:31,330
你来自哪里，朋友？
Where are you from, paesano?

587
00:28:31,370 --> 00:28:33,750
朋友？请别鼓励他
Paesano? Don't encourage him, please

588
00:28:33,790 --> 00:28:35,040
我来自委内瑞拉，亲爱的
I'm from Venezuela, darling

589
00:28:35,090 --> 00:28:36,130
你知道这首歌吗？
Do you know this song?

590
00:28:50,850 --> 00:28:53,140
我能看出她为何还爱着他！
I can see why she still loves him!

591
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:54,610
来，上船来
Come on Come on board

592
00:28:54,650 --> 00:28:57,450
–一场灾难将至 –爸爸
- This is gonna be a disaster - Dad

593
00:28:58,570 --> 00:28:59,570
干杯！
Cheers!

594
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:03,370
我穿了乘船的衣服 但没料到有那么冷
I dressed for boating but I didn't realize how cold it was gonna be

595
00:29:03,410 --> 00:29:08,620
我在米兰遇见我的前夫莫里斯 他为他的泳装产品来参加展会
My late husband Morris, I met him in Milano for a trade show for his swimwear line

596
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:11,570
他以前总说：“在冬天扬帆
He used to say, "Sailing in the winter...

597
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:15,120
“正如在生意场的生活”
"is the best comparison to life in the world of commerce"

598
00:29:20,590 --> 00:29:23,100
莫里斯号

599
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:32,140
哦，不！
Oh, no!

600
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:35,350
莫里斯的茶树木甲板！
Morris' teakwood deck!

601
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:37,070
对，干得真不错，真棒
Yeah Grand adventure Great

602
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:38,740
干得好，大歌星
Nice work, Tom Jones

603
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:44,650
特鲁迪，我知道那真不幸 可能莫里斯会说：“多棒的冒险啊！”
Trudy, I know that it's upsetting, but wouldn't Morris say, "What a grand adventure?"

604
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:47,910
对，你说得对，不是大事 他可能正在天堂大笑呢
Yeah, you're right No big deal He's probably laughing up in heaven

605
00:29:47,950 --> 00:29:49,620
我们该用纸杯的
We should have used paper cups

606
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,360
不，那感觉就不一样了
No, but it's not the same thing

607
00:29:51,410 --> 00:29:53,700
你要用好杯子喝好酒
You need a nice glass for a beautiful wine, you know?

608
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:00,340
哦，天啊
Oh, boy

609
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:03,600
看，她手上有一片玻璃碎
Look It's a piece of glass right in her hand

610
00:30:06,970 --> 00:30:09,020
你没事吧，亲爱的？
Are you all right, honey?

611
00:30:09,050 --> 00:30:11,300
嗯，她在想事情呢，托尼
Yeah, she's thinking of something, Tony

612
00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:14,860
一个圈，一个连续的东西
One loop One continuous thing

613
00:30:14,890 --> 00:30:17,930
她在自言自语，好奇怪
She's talking to herself It's strange

614
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:19,400
亲爱的，你该上床睡觉了
Honey, you should go to bed

615
00:30:20,150 --> 00:30:24,120
如果是一个连续的圈，对
If it was all one continuous loop Yeah

616
00:30:26,070 --> 00:30:27,570
嗨，我是图森
Hi, I'm Touissant

617
00:30:27,610 --> 00:30:29,490
图森？这是谁？
Touissant? Who's this guy?

618
00:30:30,450 --> 00:30:31,570
不是找我的，找你的吗？
It's not for me Is it for you?

619
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:32,750
不，不是找我的
No, it's not for me, man

620
00:30:32,790 --> 00:30:34,040
水管工
The plumber

621
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:35,340
他来做什么？
What's he here for?

622
00:30:35,370 --> 00:30:37,040
你觉得呢？泰瑞的事
What do you think? Terry

623
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:38,830
泰瑞的事，哦，泰瑞
Terry Oh, Terry

624
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:42,340
哦，不，怎么回事？ 这个男人在我房间做什么？
Oh, no, wait What's going on? What is this man doing in my room?

625
00:30:42,670 --> 00:30:43,670
这是…
This is...

626
00:30:44,010 --> 00:30:45,680
–图森 –图森
- Touissant - Touissant

627
00:30:46,550 --> 00:30:47,970
泰瑞，这是图森
Terry, Touissant

628
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:51,310
我把节目录下来了
Well, I mean, I've taped my show...

629
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:54,520
这要弄多久？
and then, well, exactly how long is this going to take?

630
00:30:55,230 --> 00:30:57,570
应该不超过一天
Well, it shouldn't take more than a day

631
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:00,100
那是哪种口音，乔伊？
What accent is that, Joy?

632
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:01,700
是哪个国家的口音？
What country is that from?

633
00:31:01,730 --> 00:31:03,400
–海地 –海地
- Haiti - Haiti

634
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:04,600
海地？
Haiti?

635
00:31:04,650 --> 00:31:06,110
那里讲法语和克里奥尔语
It's French and Creole

636
00:31:07,110 --> 00:31:08,650
法语和克里奥尔语
French and Creole

637
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:11,500
有没有方法… 你能在这挂一个帘子
Well, is there any way... Could you please put a curtain up here...

638
00:31:11,530 --> 00:31:14,700
这样在他干活的时候 我就能进出我的房间和看电视了？
so that I can come and go in my room and watch my show while he's still working?

639
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:16,460
当然，我有个钉墙机
Of course I have a stapler

640
00:31:16,910 --> 00:31:18,030
谢谢你，先生
Thank you, sir

641
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:19,740
不用谢，小姐
You're welcome, mademoiselle

642
00:31:19,790 --> 00:31:20,910
小姐？
Mademoiselle?

643
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:26,290
祝你好运，跟她，还有水管
Good luck in here and good luck with the... that

644
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:28,600
你去睡觉吧
Why don't you go to bed?

645
00:31:29,970 --> 00:31:31,930
继续上楼梯，去睡觉
Keep going up the stairs Go to bed

646
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:35,270
我不想睡觉，我不想做那个噩梦
I don't want to go to sleep I don't want to have that horrible dream

647
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:38,690
别这样！你不可能做同一个梦，从来不会
Come on! You can't have the same dream twice It never happens

648
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:41,070
–不可能的 –不对
- It's impossible - That's not true

649
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:43,520
我小时候做了多次佩吉戴面具
I had the Peggy dream so many times when I was younger...

650
00:31:43,570 --> 00:31:44,950
穿长袍的梦
with the masks and the robe

651
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:46,520
这不合理，不
It doesn't make sense No, no

652
00:31:46,570 --> 00:31:49,080
你不会做同一个梦，可能是…
You can't have the same dream twice Maybe it's the...

653
00:31:49,110 --> 00:31:50,480
鲁迪，她在思考些东西
Rudy, she's thinking about something

654
00:31:50,530 --> 00:31:53,150
可能是个好梦，她在思考问题
Maybe it's a good dream, and she's working something out

655
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:56,710
我不想思考任何问题，我只想睡个好觉
I don't wanna work anything out I just want a nice, dumb sleep

656
00:31:56,750 --> 00:31:59,340
我们想办法让她睡 给她喝点儿童止咳糖浆
Let's knock her out Give her a children's cough medicine

657
00:31:59,370 --> 00:32:00,790
–会有作用 –安全吗？
- That's what does it - Is that safe?

658
00:32:00,830 --> 00:32:02,160
不，不安全
No It's not safe

659
00:32:02,210 --> 00:32:03,300
过期了
It's expired

660
00:32:04,210 --> 00:32:06,920
给你，喝下去，亲爱的
Go on, there Knock it back, honey

661
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:09,040
–不要 –好，再来一杯，来啊
- No - Okay, one more Knock it down Come on

662
00:32:09,090 --> 00:32:10,840
–鲁迪！ –照做，托尼
- Rudy! - Do it, Tony

663
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,550
–我不确定 –倒吧，再来一杯
- I don't know - Just do it One more

664
00:32:12,590 --> 00:32:13,590
好，再来一杯
Okay, one more

665
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:16,190
够了！就这样，我去给她弄杯香甜热酒
Enough with this! That's it I'm gonna make her a hot toddy

666
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:17,470
那个才是她需要的
That's what she needs

667
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:18,690
你会把她灌醉的
You're gonna intoxicate her

668
00:32:18,730 --> 00:32:21,570
全是天然的草药，没有效用强的成分
It's all natural, it's all herbal Nothing strong

669
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:27,850
我被另一个来自瑞士的修道士绑架
I was kidnapped by another monk, who was from Switzerland

670
00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:36,370
这个修道士原是皇家的公爵
And it turned out that this monk was a duke of a royal family

671
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:40,790
我不该说“原是”，他仍旧是
I shouldn't say "was," because he still is

672
00:32:41,170 --> 00:32:42,670
别管我
Leave me alone

673
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:45,670
我们不该让她睡在楼梯上
I don't thi nk we should let her sleep on the stairs

674
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:48,510
我们把她放在沙发上吧？
Let's just put it here in the couch, okay?

675
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:03,810
17年
Seventeen years

676
00:33:03,850 --> 00:33:06,600
好好想想，我们一直隐藏了
Think about it We've been hiding...

677
00:33:06,650 --> 00:33:09,410
17年
for seventeen years

678
00:33:10,570 --> 00:33:12,660
17年
Seventeen years

679
00:33:13,110 --> 00:33:16,570
17年前我们常造东西
We used to make things Seventeen years ago

680
00:33:17,030 --> 00:33:19,410
然后全停止了，怎么了？
Then, that all stopped What happened?

681
00:33:21,250 --> 00:33:24,340
当你藏起来时，你很安全
When you're hiding, you're safe...

682
00:33:24,750 --> 00:33:27,470
因为人们看不见你
because people can't see you

683
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:30,720
但藏起来的问题是
But, funny thing about hiding...

684
00:33:31,130 --> 00:33:33,500
你在逃避自己
you're even hidden from yourself

685
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:48,610
宝贝，怎么了？
Baby, what's the matter?

686
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:51,950
托尼，你要从地下室搬出去
Tony, you need to move out of the basement

687
00:33:51,990 --> 00:33:53,700
你要自己出去住
You need to get your own house

688
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:55,200
什么？为什么？
What? Why?

689
00:33:55,780 --> 00:33:58,400
因为我晚上去安吉拉的俱乐部唱歌？
Because I go out at night and sing at Angela's club?

690
00:33:58,450 --> 00:33:59,700
–是因为这吗？ –不是
- Is that it? - No

691
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:02,160
因为我们已经离婚两年了
Because we've been divorced for two years

692
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,830
我们要向前看
We need to move on

693
00:34:03,870 --> 00:34:05,160
你要搬出去
You need to move out

694
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:07,830
鲁迪，你也要搬出去
Rudy, you need to move out, too

695
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:08,800
什么？
What?

696
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:10,930
现在地下室有更多的空间了
There's more room in the basement for me now

697
00:34:11,590 --> 00:34:12,680
还有另一件事，鲁迪
And another thing, Rudy

698
00:34:12,710 --> 00:34:15,170
明天我想跟你和特鲁迪 在你的办公室开个会
Tomorrow, I would like to have a meeting with you and Trudy at your office...

699
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:18,770
和她谈谈投资生产我的一个新想法
to discuss her investing in the manufacturing of my new idea

700
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:20,220
不行
No

701
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:22,220
我还在了解她，想要爱上她
I'm still getting to know her and falling in love

702
00:34:22,270 --> 00:34:24,480
我不能那么做，我不会那么做
I can't do that I won't do that

703
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:27,360
制造什么？你在说什么？
And what manufacturing idea? What are you talking about?

704
00:34:28,810 --> 00:34:32,150
我一直都在你身旁，无论发生什么事
I have always been there for you, no matter what

705
00:34:32,530 --> 00:34:33,910
我没有为了上大学离开
I didn't go away to school

706
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:36,570
我留下来帮你和妈妈办离婚 做你的会计
I stayed to help you and Mom through the divorce and do your accounting

707
00:34:37,030 --> 00:34:39,360
我让你随时来这里住
I let you live here whenever you want...

708
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:41,610
无论什么原因
no matter what it is

709
00:34:42,370 --> 00:34:46,840
我向你郑重提出还我人情
I am respectfully asking for the favor that you owe me

710
00:34:48,170 --> 00:34:50,970
你扪心自问一下，你知道我是对的
If you look into your heart, you'll know that I'm right

711
00:34:55,550 --> 00:35:00,730
克里斯蒂，我要用你的彩色蜡笔 彩色铅笔和纸
Cristy, I need to use your crayons, your colored pencils and your paper

712
00:35:01,510 --> 00:35:03,010
来我的房间吧
Let's go to my room

713
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:40,180
你不会相信的
You're not gonna believe this

714
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:42,520
你记得你推荐的那个水管工吧？
So, you know that plumber that you recommended?

715
00:35:42,550 --> 00:35:43,720
记得，图森
Yeah, Touissant

716
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:47,510
我雇了他，泰瑞吓死了 完全不知该怎么办
So I hire him, Terry freaks out, completely disoriented

717
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:50,190
鲁迪之后，八年了 都没有男人进过她的房间
Hasn't had a man in her room for eight years, since Rudy

718
00:35:50,230 --> 00:35:52,030
让我挂了个帘子
Makes me hang a drop cloth

719
00:35:52,060 --> 00:35:53,230
我觉得
The way I look at it...

720
00:35:53,270 --> 00:35:56,560
这是你投资新领域的机会
is that this is an opportunity for you to invest in a new business...

721
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,230
意味着你会赚更多的钱
...that'll mean more money for you

722
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:03,610
爸爸，告诉里科 把五号机器关掉
Tell Rico, Dad Number five's gotta go off

723
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:06,580
里科，五号机器，关掉
Rico, number five, no, off

724
00:36:06,620 --> 00:36:08,880
关掉！谢谢你！
Go off! Thank you!

725
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:12,380
一个标准的把手，135厘米
It's a standard handle, 53 inches

726
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:14,550
套管和拖把头连接
The sleeve connects to the mop head

727
00:36:14,590 --> 00:36:16,720
这里就有点复杂了
Now, this is where it gets complicated

728
00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:20,140
有一个夹子连接套管和…
There's a clip that connects the sleeve to the...

729
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:23,220
我都不知道该怎么叫，那个“杯子”
I don't even know what to call it The "cup"

730
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:25,300
那里连接着拖把头
Which is connected to the mop head

731
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:29,060
当你把套管拉起，拖把头就会被拉紧
So, when you pull up on the sleeve, the mop head stretches...

732
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:31,640
不用手触碰就能把它拧干
so you can wring it without ever touching it with your hands

733
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:35,310
我们只看见了蜡笔画的草图
The only thing we see is this crayon drawings

734
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:36,740
我们想象不出来
We can't make heads or tails

735
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:38,740
我们不知道那是什么
We don't know what it is

736
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:42,610
那拖把不会像头发一样散着吗？ 像绳子一样？
So, the mop doesn't hang loose, like hair? Like a string?

737
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:44,910
会挂住，但不会散，不像头发
It hangs, but not on loose, open ends like hair

738
00:36:44,950 --> 00:36:46,750
是一个连续的圈
It's one continuous loop

739
00:36:46,790 --> 00:36:47,870
–我不明白 –我不明白
- I don't get it - I don't get it

740
00:36:47,910 --> 00:36:50,410
–我不明白，他来做什么？ –他来做什么？
- I don't get it What's he doing here? - What's he doing here?

741
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:53,630
他是我孩子的父亲，我的朋友 他来支持我
He is the father of our children, and my friend, and he looks out for me

742
00:37:01,430 --> 00:37:03,430
我们在创造发明
We're doing an invention

743
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:04,960
干杯
Cheers

744
00:37:05,510 --> 00:37:06,680
好
Right

745
00:37:08,770 --> 00:37:10,610
确实是，克里斯蒂
Yes we are, Cristy

746
00:37:11,390 --> 00:37:13,140
很认真的
It's very serious

747
00:37:13,810 --> 00:37:15,430
重中之重
It's priority

748
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:16,940
是的
Yes it is

749
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:17,850
我在帮忙
And I'm helping

750
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:19,570
是的
Yes you are

751
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:31,750
在海地就是这样做的
Ça se fait comme ça in Haiti

752
00:37:31,790 --> 00:37:34,000
图森在教我说法语
Touissant is teaching me how to speak French

753
00:37:34,630 --> 00:37:36,550
“勤恳”是这么说的…
And the word for "industrious" is...

754
00:37:38,250 --> 00:37:39,290
对
Yes

755
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:41,260
一开始我觉得会发生可怕的事
At first I thought maybe something scary would happen...

756
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:45,350
正如在丹妮卡身上发生的事 她被一个人绑架
like what happened with Danica while she was kidnapped by a man...

757
00:37:45,390 --> 00:37:48,140
其实那个人是个藏在瑞士的皇家贵族
who turned out to be in hiding from the royal family in Switzerland...

758
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:50,560
然后她就搬去了瑞士
and then she moved to Switzerland

759
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:52,770
当然，她跟那个人不仅仅是朋友关系
Of course, she befriended that man and more

760
00:37:53,230 --> 00:37:55,320
别想限制我，乔伊
Don't ever try and limit me, Joy

761
00:37:55,350 --> 00:37:57,430
如果你想吃混合辣蔬菜就告诉我
And let me know if you want some of this Chakalaka

762
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:58,600
说辣蔬菜就行
Chaka Say "chaka"

763
00:37:58,650 --> 00:37:59,450
辣蔬菜
Chaka

764
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:00,350
很好吃的
It's very good

765
00:38:08,410 --> 00:38:10,170
嘿，洛奇，嘿，汤姆！
Hey, Rocky Hey, Tom!

766
00:38:11,870 --> 00:38:13,200
带她到办公室去
Take her inside the office

767
00:38:14,210 --> 00:38:16,710
–嘿，提诺 –嘿，乔伊
- Hey, Tino - Hey, Joy

768
00:38:16,750 --> 00:38:18,750
我想给你看样东西
I wanted to show you something

769
00:38:18,790 --> 00:38:20,290
你能帮我造这个吗？
So, will you help me figure this out?

770
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:23,430
我知道它需要焊接 这个部分要能转起来
I know that it has to be welded This part is supposed to twist

771
00:38:49,950 --> 00:38:53,880
1、2、3
1... 2... 3...

772
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:57,080
4、5、6…
4, 5, 6...

773
00:38:57,750 --> 00:38:58,710
你在做什么？
What are you doing?

774
00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:07,710
38、39、40
38, 39, 40

775
00:39:08,050 --> 00:39:11,220
好了，爸爸，过来抓住这里
All right All right, Dad, come over here and grab this

776
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:12,930
抓住中间
Grab it right in the middle

777
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:18,690
好，这样
Okay There

778
00:39:18,730 --> 00:39:21,400
举起来，杰基往下，你明白了？
And go up, Jackie go down You see it?

779
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:22,450
还没
Not yet

780
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:24,520
好，这样
All right Here

781
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,770
–现在呢？ –没有
- How about now? - No

782
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:28,950
你会明白的
Well you're going to

783
00:39:28,990 --> 00:39:31,200
我还未明白，我是说…
I don't see it yet, I mean...

784
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:37,630
–你们准备好了？ –好了
- You ready? - Yeah

785
00:39:44,670 --> 00:39:47,250
91米的全棉线
300 feet of continuous cotton loops

786
00:39:47,670 --> 00:39:49,250
我画的就是这个
That's what I drew

787
00:39:50,010 --> 00:39:54,430
这就是为什么 我要你投资这个产品，特鲁迪
This is why I would like to ask you for your investment, Trudy

788
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:59,430
乔伊，莫里斯辛苦工作50年才赚到这些钱
Morris worked 50 years to earn his fortune, Joy

789
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:04,990
他过世前让我在他床前发誓
Before he passed on to the next world, he made me promise on his deathbed...

790
00:40:05,030 --> 00:40:09,160
我不会轻易浪费他辛苦挣到的
that I would never be neglectful with one dollar of the money...

791
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:11,290
每一块钱
that he so carefully earned

792
00:40:11,990 --> 00:40:17,410
所以你必须回答莫里斯的 四个跟理财有关的问题
Therefore you have to answer Morris's four questions of financial worthiness

793
00:40:17,450 --> 00:40:18,580
你准备好了吗？
Are you ready?

794
00:40:19,710 --> 00:40:21,090
我想我准备好了
I think so Yes

795
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:24,300
第一个问题
Question number one:

796
00:40:25,050 --> 00:40:27,300
你在哪里上的高中？
Where did you go to high school?

797
00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:29,010
普兰菲尔德公立高中
Plainfield Public High

798
00:40:29,050 --> 00:40:33,310
第二个问题 你高中念得怎样？
Question number two: Who were you in high school?

799
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:35,560
我是最优等生
I was valedictorian

800
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:39,180
学校里最聪明的学生
The smartest student in the school

801
00:40:39,230 --> 00:40:40,520
那很好，是吧？
That's good, right?

802
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:42,610
也许
Perhaps

803
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:48,910
乔伊也许是一个聪明的 还未崛起的商人
Joy might be a brilliant, unrealized creator of commerce

804
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:50,480
但另一方面
But on the other hand...

805
00:40:50,530 --> 00:40:54,500
同样可能的是 她会是一个致命的失败者
it's equally possible that she is a fatally flawed underachiever...

806
00:40:54,530 --> 00:40:59,660
注定要失败、令人失望 以及不能实现期望
doomed to a lifetime of failure, disappointment, unfulfilled expectations

807
00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:02,460
乔伊，你必须承认
You must admit, Joy...

808
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:05,550
你迄今为止的生活
that your life, to date, makes a stronger case for...

809
00:41:06,550 --> 00:41:07,840
很令人失望
...disappointment

810
00:41:10,050 --> 00:41:11,600
我不在乎这些
I don't care about any of this

811
00:41:11,630 --> 00:41:14,550
这不但冒险 而且在财务上不负责
It's not only risky, but it's fiscally irresponsible...

812
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:17,060
并且毫无道理
and doesn't make any sense, whatsoever

813
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:18,600
乔伊这辈子都没做过生意
Joy's never run a business in her life

814
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:20,930
我过去十年都在打理我爸的修车厂
I've been running my father's garage for the last 10 years

815
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:23,220
我们的爸爸
Our father

816
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:26,950
我想要为这个现成的生意
I have ventures that I'm planning to launch here...

817
00:41:26,980 --> 00:41:29,020
找合作投资
at this existing business

818
00:41:29,070 --> 00:41:31,530
在我来找特鲁迪投资前
You never mentioned any of this...

819
00:41:31,570 --> 00:41:33,740
你对这些提都没提过
until I came to Trudy to ask for an investment

820
00:41:34,570 --> 00:41:37,030
莫里斯的第三个问题是？
What's Morris's third question?

821
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:38,540
你是否准备好
Are you prepared...

822
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:42,090
在投资的六个月内
within six months of commencing this venture...

823
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:44,120
产出足够的回报？
to show adequate returns?

824
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,720
我接受你的条件
I accept your terms

825
00:41:46,750 --> 00:41:48,210
别这样做，乔伊
Don't do it, Joy

826
00:41:48,250 --> 00:41:50,210
第四个问题呢？
What's the fourth question?

827
00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:54,810
你在一个房间里 桌上有一把枪
You are in a room, and there is a gun on the table

828
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:59,550
而房间里的另一个人是你的商业对手
And the only other person in the room is an adversary in commerce

829
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:01,980
你们二人中只有一人能活下来
Only one of you can prevail

830
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:07,780
不过，你已经保住了 你的生意和莫里斯的钱
Yet, you have protected your business and Morris's money

831
00:42:09,730 --> 00:42:11,940
乔伊，你会拿起枪吗？
Do you pick up the gun, Joy?

832
00:42:13,530 --> 00:42:15,790
这是个很诡异的问题
That's a very strange question

833
00:42:15,820 --> 00:42:19,820
这个问题一点也不诡异
There is nothing strange about this question at all

834
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:21,790
这是关乎钱
This is money

835
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:26,800
你会拿起枪吗？
Do you pick up the gun?

836
00:42:27,750 --> 00:42:29,330
我会拿起枪
I pick up the gun

837
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:30,510
很好
Good

838
00:42:31,380 --> 00:42:33,850
当我跟我的律师谈话时
I'm going to remember that you said that...

839
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:37,300
我会记得你说过这话
when I speak to my lawyer

840
00:42:38,390 --> 00:42:40,770
特鲁迪的律师说了什么？
What did Trudy's lawyer say?

841
00:42:40,810 --> 00:42:42,900
他查遍了全球的专利
He did a worldwide patent search

842
00:42:42,930 --> 00:42:44,350
什么是专利？
What's a patent?

843
00:42:45,270 --> 00:42:48,740
专利就像是保护你的想法的法律
A patent is like a law that you get to protect your idea

844
00:42:49,110 --> 00:42:51,360
很多人为他们的想法申请专利
A lot of people patent their ideas...

845
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:54,070
但只有少数人能实现它们
but only a few of them actually get their ideas made

846
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:56,940
所以特鲁迪只是想要谨慎行事
So Trudy just wanted to be careful...

847
00:42:56,990 --> 00:42:58,370
乔伊
Joy...

848
00:42:58,410 --> 00:43:02,370
我只想让你知道 图森就要完成他的工作了
I just wanted to let you know that Touissant has almost finished his work

849
00:43:02,410 --> 00:43:03,740
还有…
And, um...

850
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:07,620
我们真的要给他多找些活干
You know, we really need to find some more work for him

851
00:43:07,670 --> 00:43:09,960
–你想为这房子做更多活？ –对
- You want more work in the house? - Yeah

852
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,790
我得去做另外一个大项目
I have another big job I have to go to

853
00:43:12,630 --> 00:43:14,260
–什么？ –是的
- What? - Yes

854
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:16,430
–但我们这里确实有问题 –抱歉
- Well, but we have real issues here - Sorry

855
00:43:16,930 --> 00:43:18,890
–妈，我们没钱请他 –嗯…
- We don't have money for that work, Mom - Well...

856
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:20,680
好吧
Okay

857
00:43:21,930 --> 00:43:23,430
乔伊…
Joy...

858
00:43:23,930 --> 00:43:25,350
妈，你怎么了？
What is happening to you, Mother?

859
00:43:25,390 --> 00:43:27,180
我不知道
I don't know what's going on

860
00:43:27,230 --> 00:43:28,860
你爱上图森了？
Are you in love with Touissant?

861
00:43:30,020 --> 00:43:32,350
我感觉很孤独
I was feeling alone

862
00:43:33,820 --> 00:43:37,030
并且我都没有意识到
And I didn't even realize it, you know?

863
00:43:37,070 --> 00:43:38,230
然后…
And then...

864
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:45,870
专利搜索的结果呢？
What did the patent search find?

865
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:49,200
特鲁迪只是想谨慎行事
Trudy just wanted to be careful

866
00:43:49,670 --> 00:43:52,220
这个人找到一个德州的人
And this guy found a man that's in Texas...

867
00:43:52,250 --> 00:43:54,960
他为一个外国人工作
who worked for another guy in another country...

868
00:43:55,010 --> 00:44:00,020
他们有个想法 可能跟我的拖把类似
where they have an idea that might be similar to my mop

869
00:44:00,050 --> 00:44:01,300
哪个国家？
What country?

870
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:02,840
香港
Hong Kong

871
00:44:02,890 --> 00:44:06,690
那个香港人在德州达拉斯有代理人
The Hong Kong man has a representative in Dallas, Texas

872
00:44:06,730 --> 00:44:10,400
他在德州的代理人跟我的律师很讲理
The Dallas man was very reasonable with my lawyer

873
00:44:11,690 --> 00:44:12,740
嘿
Hey

874
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:21,370
这个德州人…
So, this guy in T exas...

875
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:26,070
我们应该向他支付专利保护费，对吧？
We're supposed to pay him a royalty on the patent as a protection, right?

876
00:44:26,330 --> 00:44:27,040
对
Right

877
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:28,710
以防被要求索赔
T o be safe from any claims

878
00:44:28,750 --> 00:44:29,920
对吧？
Is that correct?

879
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:32,050
请别再使用“我们”这个字眼
Please stop using the word "we"

880
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:34,540
这都不是你的钱 也跟你无关
None of this is your money or your business

881
00:44:34,590 --> 00:44:38,390
但这个人同时拥有一家制造工厂
But the same guy also owns a manufacturing plant...

882
00:44:38,420 --> 00:44:41,550
你们说他的要价最便宜？
that you guys say that it's cheaper than any other place?

883
00:44:41,590 --> 00:44:43,300
–是的，在加州 –对
- Yes In California - Yes

884
00:44:43,350 --> 00:44:45,890
一个金属和塑料注塑模具厂
A metal and plastic injection mold factory

885
00:44:45,930 --> 00:44:47,050
好的，所以是同一个人
Okay, so it's the same guy

886
00:44:47,100 --> 00:44:48,860
–他拥有这项专利… –做生意经常都是这样
- He owns the patent... - This happens all the time in business

887
00:44:48,890 --> 00:44:51,260
你找到了最好的合伙人，那很明智
You find the best partner It's smart

888
00:44:51,310 --> 00:44:53,680
他不懂生意
He doesn't understand business He doesn't know business

889
00:44:53,730 --> 00:44:56,100
–对，我是不懂 –我懂生意
- No, no, I'm the first to say that - I understand business

890
00:44:56,150 --> 00:44:59,570
爸爸和我总是为修车厂买配件
Dad and I, we buy parts for the trucks all the time at the garage

891
00:44:59,610 --> 00:45:01,400
莫里斯总是那样做的
Morris did it all the time

892
00:45:01,450 --> 00:45:03,870
一站式采购，那是最便宜的
One-stop shopping It's the cheapest

893
00:45:03,910 --> 00:45:05,330
–但那正常吗？ –他就是那样赚钱的
- But is that normal? - That's how he made his money

894
00:45:05,370 --> 00:45:06,540
–对，正常 –对！
- Yeah, that's normal - Yes!

895
00:45:06,580 --> 00:45:08,380
那个拥有专利的人和拥有工厂的
But is it normal, the same guy who has the patent...

896
00:45:08,410 --> 00:45:10,080
是同一个人，这正常吗？
is the same guy who has the manufacturing?

897
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:11,450
–再好不过了 –对
- Yeah Make it best - Yeah

898
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:13,420
–是吗？ –那样最好
- Yeah? - Better if it's that way

899
00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:15,590
好，那律师呢？莫里斯的律师？
Okay, and the lawyer? Right? Morris's lawyer?

900
00:45:15,630 --> 00:45:17,340
–他很好，别找事 –他好得很
- He's good Let's not make trouble - He's very good

901
00:45:17,380 --> 00:45:21,720
但他的专长是服装业，对吧？ 而不是制造业
But he specialized in garment business, no? Not manufacturing business

902
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:25,350
托尼，见好就收吧
Tony Let's quit while we're ahead

903
00:45:27,510 --> 00:45:31,930
我知道你想让托尼当顾问
I know that you want Tony to be your counselor, if you will...

904
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:34,030
我尊重那一点
and I will respect that...

905
00:45:34,060 --> 00:45:38,520
在这场商业活动中 托尼和你也应该
as Tony and you should respect what we're proposing...

906
00:45:38,570 --> 00:45:41,910
尊重我们推荐的律师
as the lawyer for this whole business endeavor

907
00:45:46,580 --> 00:45:49,670
好了，配件已经从加州送来
All right The parts have arrived from California...

908
00:45:49,700 --> 00:45:51,990
我们能在这里开始生产
and we can start manufacturing here

909
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:54,840
我装好了第一把拖把
I have the first assembled mop

910
00:45:55,500 --> 00:45:57,830
我说过它会改良
I told you it was gonna be more refined

911
00:45:58,630 --> 00:45:59,800
的确改良了
And it is

912
00:46:01,170 --> 00:46:02,290
马丁内斯神父来了
Father Martinez is here

913
00:46:02,340 --> 00:46:04,550
你得让那些女士们干起活来
You need to set those women up right now and get going

914
00:46:05,050 --> 00:46:06,920
她们会为这工作而感激你的，乔伊
They're gonna be so grateful for the jobs, Joy

915
00:46:06,970 --> 00:46:08,550
好，我去跟她们谈
Okay All right I'll go talk to those ladies

916
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:10,900
现在我终于有工作给她们做了
Now I finally have jobs for them

917
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:44,850
我组装给你们看…
And I'll show you guys how to assemble...

918
00:47:07,780 --> 00:47:09,940
我得承认我有些为你自豪了
I'm a little proud of you I gotta admit it

919
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:16,630
但第一批货的成本就要高一万五千美金
But, it costs much more than $15,000 to make the first run

920
00:47:16,670 --> 00:47:17,840
我知道，特鲁迪
I know, Trudy

921
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:19,960
无意冒犯，但那不是我的错
But with all due respect, that actually wasn't my fault

922
00:47:20,420 --> 00:47:22,380
看看，又有账单来了
Look at this More bills

923
00:47:24,550 --> 00:47:26,930
–什么？ –杰哈德发来的另一张账单
- What? - Another bill from Gerhardt

924
00:47:26,970 --> 00:47:29,720
这家伙一直为他的过失向我收钱
This guy keeps billing me for his mistakes

925
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:31,840
–这是做生意 –不
- That's business - No

926
00:47:31,890 --> 00:47:33,690
我不是这样做生意的
That's not the way I do business

927
00:47:33,720 --> 00:47:35,220
我要给他打电话
I'm calling this guy

928
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:40,100
帕克制造厂–账单

929
00:47:40,610 --> 00:47:42,700
杰哈德，我不会为这些配件一再付钱
Gerhardt, I'm not gonna keep paying for these parts...

930
00:47:42,730 --> 00:47:44,350
你做了四次才做对
that it's taking you four times to get right

931
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:47,400
那是你的设计 你得为那些配件付钱
That was your design You have to pay for those parts

932
00:47:47,450 --> 00:47:50,330
模具生产就是这样的
That's mold-making That's the process

933
00:47:50,370 --> 00:47:52,750
我们做出东西来 我的客户都会付钱
My clients pay when we figure it out

934
00:47:52,780 --> 00:47:54,450
那不是我的设计，杰哈德
It was not my desig n, Gerhardt

935
00:47:54,490 --> 00:47:57,030
是你的错误，我不会付钱
It was your mistake I'm not paying it

936
00:47:57,080 --> 00:47:59,620
那是你的设计，你得付钱
That was your design You have to pay

937
00:47:59,670 --> 00:48:01,590
你刚挂掉了他的电话？
Did you just hang up on him?

938
00:48:01,630 --> 00:48:05,050
这家伙本该很好合作 而且成本低廉的
This guy was supposed to be easy and inexpensive

939
00:48:05,090 --> 00:48:07,720
结果他不停地向我们多要钱 我不会付
He keeps overbilling us I'm not paying for it

940
00:48:09,340 --> 00:48:11,720
谁也不许付
Nobody pay it

941
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:13,930
我要跟这个家伙斗争到底
I'm gonna fight it out with this guy

942
00:48:13,970 --> 00:48:17,100
把它们装好，卖出去
Just assemble them and try to sell them

943
00:48:17,140 --> 00:48:19,600
把它放进你的橱窗 让你的顾客决定
Just put it in your window Let your customers decide

944
00:48:19,650 --> 00:48:21,190
我全家都一直照顾你的生意
My family's been going to you my whole life

945
00:48:21,230 --> 00:48:24,150
听着，大公司花钱买我的货架位
Look, the big companies, they pay me for my shelf space

946
00:48:24,650 --> 00:48:27,240
也许你能把你的拖把卖给大公司
Maybe you can sell one of your mops to those big companies

947
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:29,910
也许他们会把它摆上我的货架
And maybe they'll put it on my shelf

948
00:48:31,110 --> 00:48:35,570
19块95是挺贵 但你以后再也不用买第二个拖把
It's expensive, at $1995, but it's the only mop you'll ever have to buy

949
00:48:35,620 --> 00:48:39,880
但我不想让人们花20块钱 只买一个拖把
But I don't want people to buy one mop for $20...

950
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:41,670
之后再也不用买拖把
and never have to buy another mop again

951
00:48:41,710 --> 00:48:46,680
我宁愿让他们不断买我们的五块钱拖把 50次、100次
I'd rather they keep buying our mops at $5, 50 times, 100 times

952
00:48:47,510 --> 00:48:52,100
听着，你没钱又无事可做 你有个点子
Look, you were broke and bored You had an idea

953
00:48:52,140 --> 00:48:54,310
那又怎样？很多人都有点子
So what? Lots of people have ideas

954
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:57,430
回家吧，拜托，照顾好你的家人
Go home Please, take care of your family

955
00:48:58,520 --> 00:49:00,480
嗨，你想试试新拖把吗？
Hi Would you like to try a new mop?

956
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:01,650
凯马特
It's the only mop you'll ever have to buy

957
00:49:01,690 --> 00:49:03,780
你这辈子只用买一个拖把

958
00:49:04,770 --> 00:49:06,980
–嗨，你想试试新拖把吗？ –不了
- Hi Would you like to try a new mop? - No

959
00:49:07,030 --> 00:49:08,450
它能自己拧干
It's self-wringing

960
00:49:08,490 --> 00:49:10,910
你可以把拖把头拆下 扔进洗衣机里洗
You can remove the mop head, throw it in the washing machine

961
00:49:10,950 --> 00:49:12,080
–没有细菌 –不了
- No germs - No

962
00:49:12,110 --> 00:49:12,730
不了
No

963
00:49:13,570 --> 00:49:15,320
–不了？ –看看
- No? - Look at that

964
00:49:15,370 --> 00:49:17,370
你想试试吗？试试就好
You want to just try it? You could just try

965
00:49:17,410 --> 00:49:20,580
它能自己拧干，看到了吗？ 没有别的拖把能做到
It can self-wring See? No other mop does this

966
00:49:41,770 --> 00:49:44,230
来试试全新的拖把吧！
Come and try the brand-new mop!

967
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:47,320
–这是未来的拖把 –不用，谢了
- It's the mop of the future - No, thanks

968
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:49,700
女士们，想要试试这拖把吗？
Want to try this mop, ladies?

969
00:49:49,740 --> 00:49:51,030
–这是什么？ –小姐你好
- What's this? - Hey, miss

970
00:49:51,070 --> 00:49:52,410
这是全新的拖把
It's a brand-new mop

971
00:49:53,570 --> 00:49:55,530
不用弄脏手就能拧干它
You could wring it without getting your hands dirty

972
00:49:55,570 --> 00:49:56,700
不可能
I don't think so

973
00:49:56,740 --> 00:49:59,660
来试试吧，这是未来的拖把
Come on Try it It's the mop of the future

974
00:50:01,410 --> 00:50:02,530
自己拧干是吧？
Self-wringing, huh?

975
00:50:02,580 --> 00:50:03,580
对
Yeah

976
00:50:03,620 --> 00:50:06,040
好吧，我的确喜欢这个点子
All right I do like the idea of that

977
00:50:06,080 --> 00:50:10,000
我讨厌在拖完浴室地板后 用手去碰拖把头
I hate having to touch the mop head after I get done cleaning the bathroom floor

978
00:50:10,050 --> 00:50:11,430
我总觉得那很恶心
I always think that's disgusting, you know?

979
00:50:11,470 --> 00:50:12,640
恶心死了
It's so gross

980
00:50:12,670 --> 00:50:16,550
哇，真的能拖到 我的泡沫拖把拖不到的边角
Wow It really does get all the corners that my sponge mop won't get

981
00:50:16,890 --> 00:50:20,060
所有这些被我孩子溅得满是果汁的角落
All those crannies where my kids spill their juice

982
00:50:20,970 --> 00:50:23,140
我真的很喜欢，我们买一个吧？
I really like it Can we buy it?

983
00:50:23,190 --> 00:50:24,610
别着急，克里斯蒂
Take it easy, Cristy

984
00:50:24,940 --> 00:50:28,070
哇，太棒了 你的手不用碰到
Wow I mean, that's just amazing You really don't have to touch it

985
00:50:28,110 --> 00:50:29,240
看看
Look at that

986
00:50:29,270 --> 00:50:30,600
你知道怎样让它变完美吗？
You know what would make this perfect...

987
00:50:30,650 --> 00:50:33,060
如果拖把头能拆下来 放到洗衣机里去洗
if you could remove the mop head, put it in the washing machine...

988
00:50:33,110 --> 00:50:34,770
–洗得很干净 –那就太好了
- Really get it clean - That'd be great

989
00:50:35,530 --> 00:50:36,740
–可以的 –什么？
- You can - What?

990
00:50:36,780 --> 00:50:37,900
你说真的吗？
Are you serious?

991
00:50:37,950 --> 00:50:40,250
–这拖把多少钱？ –19块95
- Well how much is this mop? - It's $1995

992
00:50:40,290 --> 00:50:41,420
不，太贵了
No, that's too much

993
00:50:41,450 --> 00:50:44,240
但我是说 如果你这一辈子只需要买一个拖把
But I guess, I mean, if it is the only mop that you ever have to buy...

994
00:50:44,290 --> 00:50:45,420
我是说我们得不断地 买那些五块钱一个的拖把
I mean we keep buying those $5 mops

995
00:50:45,460 --> 00:50:46,800
–嗨，爸爸 –嗨，宝贝
- Hi, Daddy - Hi, sweetie

996
00:50:46,830 --> 00:50:51,880
你记得安吉拉吧？ 还有她的两个哥哥？
You, you remember Angela? And her two brothers, right?

997
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:53,670
我记得，你们好
I do Hello

998
00:50:53,720 --> 00:50:55,560
–妈妈，有警察 –女士？
- Mommy, the policeman - Ma'am?

999
00:50:55,590 --> 00:50:56,920
我们犯法了吗？
Did we break the law?

1000
00:50:56,970 --> 00:50:59,270
–我要没收你的商品 –不，我们要走了
- I'm taking this merchandise - No, no We're leaving We're leaving

1001
00:50:59,300 --> 00:51:01,010
–我这次只是警告你 –我们就要离开了
- Now, I'm gonna let you off with a warning - We were just leaving

1002
00:51:01,060 --> 00:51:02,480
不，警官
No Sir...

1003
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:04,270
如果顾客们看到这拖把的威力…
If the customers can just see what the mop can do...

1004
00:51:04,310 --> 00:51:06,150
如果我再在这里看见你 你会被起诉的！
But if I catch you out here again, you will be prosecuted!

1005
00:51:06,190 --> 00:51:07,400
我该去哪里？警官，拜托！
Well, where do I go? Sir, please!

1006
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:09,610
–你不能在凯马特的地盘卖东西！ –那些拖把是我自己做的
- You cannot sell on Kmart property! - I made those mops myself

1007
00:51:09,650 --> 00:51:11,400
–我付了钱的，求你们了 –很辛苦才做好的
- I paid for them Please - It took a lot of work

1008
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:13,440
我不会再回来了 但你们没必要拿走我的东西！
I won't come back, but you don't have to take my stuff!

1009
00:51:13,820 --> 00:51:14,780
求你们了！
Please!

1010
00:51:14,820 --> 00:51:17,040
–你这样做合法吗？ –你跟你女儿一起
- Are you even allowed to do this? - How embarrassing for you...

1011
00:51:17,070 --> 00:51:18,690
这个样子多丢脸啊
to be seen here like this with your daughter

1012
00:51:18,740 --> 00:51:20,820
–你是什么样的父母啊？ –是啊，托尼
- What kind of parent are you, huh? - Yeah, Tony

1013
00:51:20,870 --> 00:51:22,000
–够了 –嘿

00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:23,040
嘿，伙计们…

1015
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:24,210
–没事了 –走

1016
00:51:24,250 --> 00:51:25,630
–我们走 –托尼，我们走
- Let's go - Tony, let's go

1017
00:51:25,660 --> 00:51:27,200
我来了，我来了
Yeah, I'm coming I'm coming

1018
00:51:38,220 --> 00:51:41,060
克里斯蒂，宝贝，没事，你妈妈没事
Cristy, honey, it's okay Your mommy's okay

1019
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:47,900
这蠢东西，这地方快散架了！
This stupid thing This place is falling apart!

1020
00:51:47,940 --> 00:51:49,650
不，不
No... No

1021
00:51:49,690 --> 00:51:50,690
纽约电话公司 电话服务停止通知

1022
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:53,560
宝贝，电话用不了
Honey, the telephone isn't working

1023
00:51:53,610 --> 00:51:55,160
我知道，我刚接到通知
I know I just got the notice

1024
00:51:55,190 --> 00:51:58,480
我得去邻居家借用电话 汤米发烧了
I had to go next door to use the phone Tommy's got a fever

1025
00:51:58,530 --> 00:51:59,650
汤米发烧了？
Tommy has a fever?

1026
00:51:59,700 --> 00:52:02,620
只是感冒、咳嗽 是传染的，所有小孩都得病了
Simple cold with a cough It's going around All the kids have it

1027
00:52:02,660 --> 00:52:04,170
谢天谢地，还有暖气
Thank God the heat's still working

1028
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:06,490
妈咪，电话怎么用不了？
Mommy, why isn't the phone working?

1029
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:08,210
因为我欠费了
Because I'm late on paying the bill

1030
00:52:09,250 --> 00:52:10,960
–我们会失去房子吗？ –你不要也这样
- Are we gonna lose our house? - Not you too

1031
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:12,580
不，我们不会失去我们的房子
No, we're not gonna lose our house

1032
00:52:13,670 --> 00:52:15,250
来，上楼，去洗澡
Come on Get upstairs Get in the bath

1033
00:52:15,300 --> 00:52:16,720
听妈妈的话，进浴缸里去
Listen to your mom and get right in that tub

1034
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:18,600
–我不想洗澡 –我不管
- I don't want a hot bath - I don't care

1035
00:52:18,630 --> 00:52:20,800
克里斯蒂，进浴缸里去 听妈妈的话
Cristy, you get in that hot bath Listen to your mother

1036
00:52:20,840 --> 00:52:22,720
我不想你也生病
I don't want you getting sick too

1037
00:52:23,430 --> 00:52:27,100
劳伦威尔斯说你是卖旧拖把的清洁女工
Lauren Wells said you're a cleaning lady and sell used mops

1038
00:52:28,730 --> 00:52:30,480
劳拉威尔斯说的？
Lauren Wells said that?

1039
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:34,230
是的，那让我很伤心
Yeah And it really hurt my feelings

1040
00:52:34,900 --> 00:52:38,280
首先，即使我是清洁女工，那又怎样？
First of all, even if I was a cleaning lady, so what?

1041
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:40,120
做体力活并不丢人
There's no shame in hard work

1042
00:52:41,490 --> 00:52:43,330
其次，我…
And second of all, you know, I'm...

1043
00:52:44,990 --> 00:52:48,580
只是想要卖新拖把，不是旧拖把
I'm trying to sell a new mop, not used mops

1044
00:52:49,160 --> 00:52:54,370
第三，别因为别人的瞎话伤心
And third of all, don't take any guff from anybody

1045
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:58,050
别让那影响到你
You know, don't let it in

1046
00:52:58,840 --> 00:53:01,880
我知道这很难，我很抱歉这事发生了
I know it's hard And I'm sorry that happened

1047
00:53:03,510 --> 00:53:04,800
进浴缸里去
Now get in the bath

1048
00:53:12,690 --> 00:53:14,490
快睡觉，宝贝
Come on Go to sleep, honey

1049
00:53:28,950 --> 00:53:30,080
乔伊？
Joy?

1050
00:53:30,330 --> 00:53:31,830
现在不说了，外婆
Not now, Mimi

1051
00:53:31,870 --> 00:53:34,910
乔伊，等等，跟我说今天发生了什么事
Joy, wait, wait Just tell me what happened today

1052
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:37,340
我想知道事情的经过 求你了，我想知道
I want to know how it went Please, I want to know

1053
00:53:39,550 --> 00:53:40,970
很糟糕
It was a disaster

1054
00:53:41,930 --> 00:53:43,140
但你一定不能放弃
But you must never give up

1055
00:53:43,180 --> 00:53:44,890
你从小就是天生的…
Ever since you were little, you were born to bear...

1056
00:53:44,930 --> 00:53:47,140
天生的什么，外婆？
Born to bear what, Mimi?

1057
00:53:48,020 --> 00:53:50,480
失败者？蒙羞者？
Failure? Disgrace?

1058
00:53:51,690 --> 00:53:53,980
在我女儿面前被羞辱的人？
Humiliation in front of my daughter?

1059
00:53:54,730 --> 00:53:58,820
在这个家里 你天生就从容大度
You were born to be the unanxious presence in the room

1060
00:53:58,860 --> 00:54:01,910
我知道我会活到看到你
And I know that I'm gonna live to see you grow...

1061
00:54:01,950 --> 00:54:05,330
成为一个天生的好家长
to be the successful matriarch that you were born to be

1062
00:54:05,370 --> 00:54:06,370
女性家长…
Matriarch...

1063
00:54:07,660 --> 00:54:09,040
成为有勇气的母亲
T o be a mother with courage

1064
00:54:09,080 --> 00:54:10,960
连自己的孩子都养不活
Who can't even support her children

1065
00:54:11,370 --> 00:54:12,450
宝贝
Sweetheart

1066
00:54:16,420 --> 00:54:18,380
你在这里干什么？
What are you doing here?

1067
00:54:18,420 --> 00:54:20,130
我有个主意
I have this idea

1068
00:54:20,170 --> 00:54:21,920
–我认识一个人 –什么人？
- A guy I know - What guy?

1069
00:54:21,970 --> 00:54:27,140
他以前跟我共事过 现在他为一个大零售商做事
He used to work with me And now he works at this big retailer

1070
00:54:27,180 --> 00:54:29,480
新型的生意
A new way of doing business

1071
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:31,310
我是说，值得一试
I mean, it's worth a try

1072
00:54:32,680 --> 00:54:34,720
你会帮我吗？
You would do that for me?

1073
00:54:34,770 --> 00:54:36,030
当然
Of course

1074
00:54:36,060 --> 00:54:38,520
他们是美国模范离婚夫妇
They were the best divorced couple in America

1075
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:42,190
相处得比他们还是夫妻时更好
Much better friends than they were husband and wife

1076
00:54:43,110 --> 00:54:44,650
我能帮你安排跟他见面
I can get you a meeting with him

1077
00:54:47,120 --> 00:54:48,460
在哪里？
Where is it?

1078
00:54:52,040 --> 00:54:54,290
但我不明白我们在阿米什区干什么
But I don't understand what we're doing in Amish country

1079
00:54:54,330 --> 00:54:56,950
他们连电都没有 他们怎能在电视上销售？
They don't even have electricity out here How could they sell anything on TV?

1080
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,370
这跟亚米什人无关
It has nothing to do with Amish people

1081
00:54:59,420 --> 00:55:02,010
只是碰巧在这里 我查过了
It just happens to be located here I looked it up

1082
00:55:02,050 --> 00:55:03,800
在亚米什区
In Amish country

1083
00:55:03,840 --> 00:55:04,790
是阿米什
Amish

1084
00:55:04,840 --> 00:55:05,670
什么？
What?

1085
00:55:05,720 --> 00:55:07,720
–阿米什 –阿米什
- Amish - Amish

1086
00:55:19,730 --> 00:55:21,060

1087
00:55:22,940 --> 00:55:25,570

We're here to see Marv Brickman

1088
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:27,490
好的
Okay

1089
00:55:27,530 --> 00:55:31,070
马弗布里克曼，如果我打给 他的办公室，他会知道你是谁吗？
Marv Brickman, does he know who you are if I call his office?

1090
00:55:31,740 --> 00:55:32,860
他当然知道
Of course he knows

1091
00:55:32,910 --> 00:55:34,660
我们是朋友，我们以前在一起共事
We're friends We used to work together

1092
00:55:36,420 --> 00:55:38,090
QVC电视购物网，请稍等
QVC, please hold

1093
00:55:49,300 --> 00:55:51,880
但汤姆的数据都错了…
But Tom was wrong about that He was wrong about the numbers...

1094
00:55:56,060 --> 00:55:57,270
托尼
Tony

1095
00:55:57,310 --> 00:55:58,600
马弗，你好吗？
Marv How are you?

1096
00:55:58,650 --> 00:56:00,150
我今天不能跟你谈
I can't see you today

1097
00:56:00,190 --> 00:56:01,570
为什么？
Why?

1098
00:56:01,610 --> 00:56:03,570
如果你能住在城里，或许明天吧
Maybe tomorrow if you can stay in town

1099
00:56:03,610 --> 00:56:06,070
不行，我们还有孩子在家
No, we left the kids at home We can't

1100
00:56:06,110 --> 00:56:08,020
我们待不到明天
We can't stay until tomorrow

1101
00:56:08,070 --> 00:56:11,150
你不能就这样来就希望能见到谁吧
Listen, you can't just expect to come in here and see someone

1102
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:12,620
嘿，你弄好那个广告事宜了吗？
Hey, did you take care of that advertising thing?

1103
00:56:12,660 --> 00:56:14,870
–是的 –很好
- Yes, I did - Good All right

1104
00:56:14,910 --> 00:56:16,030
怎么了？
What's going on here?

1105
00:56:16,080 --> 00:56:17,920

- This is my good friend, Tony - Tony Miranda

1106
00:56:17,960 --> 00:56:19,420
我们一起在金宝汤公司工作过
We worked together at Campbell's

1107
00:56:19,460 --> 00:56:20,420
尼尔沃克

00:56:20,460 --> 00:56:22,010
–这是他的前妻 –很高兴见到你

她是个发明家

1111
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:28,010
她今天想跟你谈两分钟 尼尔，要不算了
She wanted two minutes of your time today, but, Neil, don't worry about this

1112
00:56:28,050 --> 00:56:29,470
–要不明天吧 –这样吧
- Maybe tomorrow - You know what?

1113
00:56:29,510 --> 00:56:32,270
要不趁销售团队还在，进来五分钟吧
Why don't you come in for five minutes while the sales group's still here

1114
00:56:32,300 --> 00:56:33,840
–好，帮我拿着包 –尼尔，你肯定？
- Okay Hold my bag - Neil, are you sure?

1115
00:56:33,890 --> 00:56:35,230

1116
00:56:35,270 --> 00:56:36,650

1120
00:56:49,570 --> 00:56:51,230
请告诉我们你的名字
So tell us your name, please

1121
00:56:54,990 --> 00:56:56,160
我叫乔伊
I'm Joy

1122
00:56:58,290 --> 00:57:00,300
今天你想给我们展示什么？
And what would you like to show us today?

1123
00:57:00,330 --> 00:57:02,620
我发明了一个自己拧干拖把
I have a self-wringing mop

1124
00:57:04,170 --> 00:57:05,050
这…
Just...

1125
00:57:05,090 --> 00:57:06,090
要帮忙吗？
Do you need some help?

1126
00:57:06,130 --> 00:57:07,300
不用
No No, no

1127
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:08,850
好了
All right

1128
00:57:10,010 --> 00:57:11,810
水泼我鞋上了
That's my shoe

1129
00:57:11,840 --> 00:57:13,670
哦，天啊，真对不起，先生
Oh, my goodness I am so sorry, sir

1130
00:57:15,930 --> 00:57:17,470
袜子都湿了
Sock's wet

1131
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:18,690
你介意吗？
Do you mind?

1132
00:57:19,850 --> 00:57:20,930
对不起
Sorry

1133
00:57:24,650 --> 00:57:26,200
那是塑料吗？
Is that plastic?

1134
00:57:26,230 --> 00:57:26,980
是的
Yes

1135
00:57:27,030 --> 00:57:29,030
阿诺德，要不你来试试吧，可以吗？
Arnold, why don't you give it a try? Is that okay?

1136
00:57:29,070 --> 00:57:30,240
当然
Yes, of course

1137
00:57:30,860 --> 00:57:32,150
把它浸下去
Just dunk it

1138
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:33,700
–我沾一下？ –是的
- I dip it? - Yes

1139
00:57:34,120 --> 00:57:36,660
然后扭一下？
And then I... twist it?

1140
00:57:36,700 --> 00:57:38,160
你要先拉一下
But you pull... You have to pull it first

1141
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:39,570
–先拉再扭 –你扭之前要先拉
- Pull it and twist it - You got to pull it first before you twist it

1142
00:57:39,620 --> 00:57:40,830
–我在拉然后… –先拉再扭
- I'm pulling it and... - Pull and twist

1143
00:57:40,870 --> 00:57:41,910
再扭
And I am twisting it

1144
00:57:42,790 --> 00:57:44,330
先拉再扭，就像做爱一样
Pull and twist, just like when you're on the road

1145
00:57:46,670 --> 00:57:50,130
我们不是有意冒犯你，乔伊 这是我们忙了一整天了，快下班了
We don't mean to be disrespectful, Joy It's the end of a long day for us

1146
00:57:51,550 --> 00:57:54,930
我觉得我该来介绍一下自己
I feel like I want to tell you a little bit about who I am

1147
00:57:54,970 --> 00:57:58,400
因为我觉得你不知道你现在在哪里
Because I have a feeling you don't know exactly where you are right now

1148
00:57:58,430 --> 00:57:59,340
我说得对吗？
Am I right?

1149
00:58:01,060 --> 00:58:02,520
十个月前
T en months ago...

1150
00:58:02,560 --> 00:58:06,060
一个叫巴里迪勒的人从洛杉矶给我打电话
a man named Barry Diller called me from Los Angeles

1151
00:58:06,980 --> 00:58:10,900
他开办了一个电视网络，福斯电视频道
He started a television network Fox television channel

1152
00:58:11,450 --> 00:58:15,700
之前他还运营着20世纪福斯电影公司
And prior to that, he ran 20th Century Fox, among other studios

1153
00:58:16,370 --> 00:58:19,120
他收购了宾州兰开斯特
And he acquired a little cable channel...

1154
00:58:19,160 --> 00:58:21,700
一家小型有线电视频道
right here in Lancaster, Pennsylvania

1155
00:58:21,750 --> 00:58:23,710
他雇了我来经营
And he hired me to run it...

1156
00:58:24,420 --> 00:58:26,510
这个全新的理念
as a bigger idea

1157
00:58:28,750 --> 00:58:30,670
我来自密歇根州的底特律
Now, I'm from Detroit, Michigan

1158
00:58:32,090 --> 00:58:36,670
我曾经营美国最大、最实惠
I ran America's largest, most affordable...

1159
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:39,680
最成功、最在乎性价比的零售连锁企业
successful, value-driven retailer

1160
00:58:39,720 --> 00:58:41,470
这个连锁企业叫做凯马特
Chain called Kmart

1161
00:58:42,100 --> 00:58:44,970
之前我负责为凯马特采购
Prior to that, I was a buyer for Kmart

1162
00:58:45,650 --> 00:58:50,110
再之前，我负责七间不同的凯马特商店
And prior to that, I managed seven separate Kmart stores

1163
00:58:50,570 --> 00:58:53,950
我决定在我们的商店里销售哪些产品
I decide what products we let into our stores here...

1164
00:58:53,990 --> 00:58:59,000
让它们进入千家万户 全天候为我们尊贵的客人服务
into people's homes, 24 hours a day, for our valued customers

1165
00:59:00,240 --> 00:59:04,160
我会很小心、谨慎地选择
I choose very carefully and very conservatively

1166
00:59:05,170 --> 00:59:09,340
我一天的大部分时间都是 在婉拒像你这样的提案
I spend most of my day deflecting incoming shots from people like yourself

1167
00:59:12,050 --> 00:59:13,090
你看见那个图表了吗？
You see that chart?

1168
00:59:18,180 --> 00:59:19,730
即日收入

1169
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:23,800
这条绿线每个月或平或升
This green line either rises or stays the same each month

1170
00:59:24,690 --> 00:59:27,480
我选的产品都不会出问题
There's no problem with my product choice

1171
00:59:28,980 --> 00:59:31,560
你知道QVC代表什么吗，乔伊？
Do you know what QVC stands for, Joy?

1172
00:59:33,490 --> 00:59:34,660
不知道
No, I don't

1173
00:59:35,400 --> 00:59:38,740
质量、价值、便利
Quality, Value, Convenience

1174
00:59:40,530 --> 00:59:43,820
我卖人们可以支付的产品 但我不卖质量差的产品
I sell product affordably, but I don't sell cheap product

1175
00:59:43,870 --> 00:59:46,370
你的拖把是塑料做的 而且看起来很奇怪
And your mop is plastic and it looks strange

1176
00:59:48,830 --> 00:59:51,330
说实话，我不懂什么图表
I don't know anything about charts

1177
00:59:51,380 --> 00:59:52,380
或是
Or...

1178
00:59:54,130 --> 00:59:55,840
生意经
...business, frankly

1179
00:59:56,680 --> 00:59:58,680
但我会在家打扫卫生
But I do clean my own home

1180
00:59:59,720 --> 01:00:01,810
我发明这个拖把
And I made this mop...

1181
01:00:01,850 --> 01:00:05,020
是因为它比市面上的任何拖把都好
because it is better than anything else out there

1182
01:00:08,230 --> 01:00:09,860
请给我一个机会
Please give me a chance

1183
01:00:12,190 --> 01:00:13,650
我喜欢用塑料来造
I like that it's plastic...

1184
01:00:13,690 --> 01:00:16,610
因为手拿着很轻，就像没拿东西
because it's so light in my hands, it's like nothing

1185
01:00:17,450 --> 01:00:20,660
而且比市面上任何一个拖把的吸水性都好
It's also ten times more absorbent than any other mop on the market

1186
01:00:20,700 --> 01:00:21,710
为什么？
Why?

1187
01:00:22,530 --> 01:00:27,490
因为用的是我自己缠的 91米连续的全棉线
Because of 300 feet of continuous cotton loop that I looped myself

1188
01:00:27,540 --> 01:00:30,380
对于一个小小的拖把头来讲
That is an enormous amount of absorbent cotton...

1189
01:00:30,420 --> 01:00:32,260
那是数量极多的吸水棉
on a very small mop head

1190
01:00:32,290 --> 01:00:35,920
现在我已经拖完洗手间了 我都没拧过一次拖把
Now I'm done with the bathroom, and I haven't wrung the mop once

1191
01:00:35,960 --> 01:00:37,540
我来问你个问题
Let me ask you a question

1192
01:00:38,380 --> 01:00:39,840
你会用这个拖把
Would you take this mop...

1193
01:00:39,890 --> 01:00:41,350
这个拖过洗手间
where you were just cleaning the bathroom...

1194
01:00:41,390 --> 01:00:43,270
马桶旁、满是细菌的拖把
and around the toilet, and all of those germs...

1195
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:45,940
去拖厨房吗？
and take it into the kitchen...

1196
01:00:45,970 --> 01:00:48,430
你的家人会在那里吃饭 你会在那里喂孩子
where your family eats, where you feed your children?

1197
01:00:49,730 --> 01:00:52,780
我把拖把头放进洗衣机去洗
I take this mop head, I put it in the washing machine...

1198
01:00:52,810 --> 01:00:54,440
出来后就像新的一样
it comes out clean like new

1199
01:00:55,480 --> 01:00:58,940
其他的拖把就做不到
You can't do that with any other mop

1200
01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:00,900
–所以… –好了
- So... - Stop

1201
01:01:04,910 --> 01:01:08,250
下周你能生产出五万把这样的拖把吗？
Can you make 50,000 of these mops by next week?

1202
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:12,090
我想可以
Yeah, I think so

1203
01:01:14,210 --> 01:01:16,830
大卫塞尔兹尼克，移民后裔
David Selznick, the son of immigrants...

1204
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:20,050
娶了俄克拉荷马州的詹妮弗琼斯 一位美国甜心
married Jennifer Jones from Oklahoma, America's sweetheart

1205
01:01:20,090 --> 01:01:22,420
这显现出，在美国
That just goes to show you that in America...

1206
01:01:22,470 --> 01:01:26,190
门不当户不对的结合是很常见的事
the ordinary meets the extraordinary every single day

1207
01:01:26,890 --> 01:01:28,640
托马斯，你想说什么？
Thomas Where are you going with that?

1208
01:01:28,680 --> 01:01:30,390
你想要的那条紧身裤
The skinny pants you wanted

1209
01:01:30,440 --> 01:01:33,110
我从没说过“紧身裤” 我说的是“大礼帽”，经典装束
I never said "skinny pants" I said, "stovepipe" Classic look

1210
01:01:33,150 --> 01:01:34,490
我听成“紧身裤”了
I heard "skinny pants"

1211
01:01:34,730 --> 01:01:36,940
你知道我有多爱大礼帽
You know how much I love the stovepipe

1212
01:01:36,980 --> 01:01:38,900
–大礼帽，经典，明白了 –明白了
- Stovepipe Classic Got it - Got it

1213
01:01:38,940 --> 01:01:40,610
–好吧，我们用大礼帽 –谢谢
- Fine, we'll go for stovepipe - Thank you

1214
01:01:42,280 --> 01:01:46,200
看到这些人了吗？我跟他们说了很多次了 他们还是不明白
See those guys? I told them so many times and they still don't understand

1215
01:01:46,240 --> 01:01:48,110
一位智者曾经说过
A very smart guy once said...

1216
01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:51,580
“一件事情你跟别人讲一遍，他们不会听 讲四遍，他们还是不听
"You tell somebody something once, they don't listen You tell somebody four times, they don't listen

1217
01:01:51,620 --> 01:01:54,750
“讲到第九遍的时候，他们才会听”
"By the ninth time you say it, they begin to hear you"

1218
01:01:54,790 --> 01:01:56,670
这就是我们要工作24小时的原因
That's why we're on 24 hours a day

1219
01:01:56,710 --> 01:01:59,170
这就是我得跟这帮人说大礼帽的原因
That's why, with the people who I have to tell about the stovepipe

1220
01:02:00,550 --> 01:02:02,180
化妆间放音乐？
Music in the makeup rooms?

1221
01:02:02,220 --> 01:02:03,720
对，我觉得这样有气氛，托德
Yeah, I thought it'd give a sense of place, Todd

1222
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:06,090
但如果你不想的话，随时可以关掉
But if you don't want it, you can always turn it down

1223
01:02:06,140 --> 01:02:07,310
你是我们最棒的销售员，托德
You're our biggest seller, Todd

1224
01:02:07,350 --> 01:02:09,520
只要你觉得舒服就好 我们就在乎你
Whatever you need to make you comfortable You're who we care about

1225
01:02:09,560 --> 01:02:10,610
你是我们最棒的销售员
You're our number-one seller

1226
01:02:10,640 --> 01:02:11,850
–什么？ –哦，不
- What? - Oh, no

1227
01:02:13,190 --> 01:02:14,690
他是你们最棒的销售员？
He's your number-one seller?

1228
01:02:14,730 --> 01:02:17,950
不不不，辛迪，别这样 你知道我们爱你的
No, no, no Cindy, please You know that we love you

1229
01:02:18,820 --> 01:02:20,030
哦，老天啊
Oh, for heaven sake

1230
01:02:20,360 --> 01:02:24,400
她一向缺乏职业素养 显而易见，她就是嫉妒
She's never had a professional attitude Clearly, she's jealous

1231
01:02:24,780 --> 01:02:26,700
但是你能帮我个忙吗？ 和她成为朋友
But could you do me a favor? Make her your friend

1232
01:02:26,740 --> 01:02:30,120
你能帮我这个忙吗，托德？ 拜托了？
Could you just do me that favor, Todd? Please?

1233
01:02:30,160 --> 01:02:31,160
为了我？
For me?

1234
01:02:32,160 --> 01:02:33,240
–可以，先生 –谢谢
- Yes, sir - Thank you

1235
01:02:33,290 --> 01:02:36,460
这是乔伊，她有个不可思议的拖把 我们下周会介绍
This is Joy She has a very exciting new mop that we're gonna introduce next week

1236
01:02:36,790 --> 01:02:38,920
我想让你介绍，你是我的最佳人选
I would like you to launch it You're my first choice

1237
01:02:38,960 --> 01:02:40,380
一个拖把？
A mop?

1238
01:02:40,420 --> 01:02:43,880
你想让我介绍一个新产品？
You want me to bring this newborn into the world?

1239
01:02:44,760 --> 01:02:50,350
你要介绍的这个新产品是我倾其所有
That newborn that you're holding is every cent, every dollar, even debt...

1240
01:02:50,390 --> 01:02:51,340
才研发出来的
that I've ever made

1241
01:02:51,980 --> 01:02:53,310
倾其所有？
Every cent you've ever made?

1242
01:02:53,600 --> 01:02:54,680
没错
That's right

1243
01:02:54,730 --> 01:02:56,780
给我太大压力可不好
That kind of pressure is not helpful

1244
01:02:57,230 --> 01:02:58,730
–什么？ –不
- What? - No

1245
01:02:58,770 --> 01:03:00,980
这也不符合我推销的技巧
It's not part of my process, either

1246
01:03:01,400 --> 01:03:02,560
哦
Oh

1247
01:03:02,860 --> 01:03:06,230
–托德 –我不是想给你压力，托德
- Todd... - I didn't mean to pressure you, Todd

1248
01:03:07,490 --> 01:03:08,700
托德

1249
01:03:08,740 --> 01:03:10,450
–表演者会很挑剔 –他非常敏感
- Performers can be finicky creatures - He's very sensitive

1250
01:03:10,700 --> 01:03:14,160
他是我们最棒的销售员 他的销售额高到
He is our number-one seller He is selling everything through the roof...

1251
01:03:14,210 --> 01:03:16,380
我们闻所未闻
in numbers we've never seen before

1252
01:03:16,790 --> 01:03:18,040
我很严肃对待
I take it very seriously

1253
01:03:18,090 --> 01:03:20,300
我把推销产品给千家万户视为荣幸
I see it as a privilege that we have to go into people's homes

1254
01:03:20,340 --> 01:03:22,140
我鄙视对此有异议的人
And I despise anybody who's cynical about that

1255
01:03:22,170 --> 01:03:25,630
杰克华纳对此没有异议 达里尔扎努克没有异议
Jack Warner wasn't cynical about that Darryl Zanuck wasn't cynical about that

1256
01:03:25,680 --> 01:03:27,520
尼尔沃克也没有异议
And Neil Walker is not cynical about that

1257

我带你去看舞台
Let me show you the stage

1258
01:03:30,720 --> 01:03:32,720
我相信，有一天
I believe eventually, one day...

1259
01:03:32,770 --> 01:03:37,730
电视节目会围绕着普通民众的生活
television will even be by and about actual regular people

1260
01:03:37,770 --> 01:03:40,980
甚至电脑也如此，全天候的播放
Maybe even on computers, 24 hours a day

1261
01:03:41,230 --> 01:03:43,730
谁都说不准 以前没人想过会有互联网
Who knows? Nobody thought this network would be real

1262
01:03:44,780 --> 01:03:46,160
而如今却如此发达了
And here we are

1263
01:03:46,910 --> 01:03:48,750
–对了，库存很多 –什么…
- By the way, stock's going through the roof - What...?

1264
01:03:51,450 --> 01:03:53,030
得小心琼的狗
Must be mindful of Joan's dog

1265
01:03:53,080 --> 01:03:56,250
谁是…谁是琼？

1266
01:03:57,080 --> 01:03:59,290
谢谢你，亲爱的
Thank you, darling

1267
01:04:00,090 --> 01:04:03,260
在男人的天下穿成这样 你永远不会成功
You're never gonna make it in a man's world dressed like that

1268
01:04:03,300 --> 01:04:05,800
皮普先生，你差点被挤成皮普煎饼了
Mr Peepers, you were almost a Peepers pancake

1269
01:04:05,840 --> 01:04:09,630
这是一个有四、五个布景的圆形舞台
It's a round stage that has four or five different sets that rotate...

1270
01:04:09,680 --> 01:04:12,480
会根据我们推销的产品在规定的时间旋转
depending on what we're selling at a given moment

1271
01:04:12,510 --> 01:04:13,930
这个扣环是项链的一部分，看到了吗？
The clasp is part of the necklace See?

琼是天生的推销员
Joan's the original seller

1277
01:04:25,030 --> 01:04:28,410
如果你刚开始收集珠宝 你能买到比这更好的吗？
If you're just starting your jewelry wardrobe, can you do anything better than this?

1278
01:04:28,450 --> 01:04:31,000
黑色、金色与珍珠的混搭
You're gonna mix in your blacks, your golds, your pearls

1279
01:04:31,030 --> 01:04:32,070
–该有的全有了 –全有了
- Everything - Everything

1280
01:04:32,120 --> 01:04:33,500
看到它和这桃色的裙子有多搭了吗？
Look at it against the peach Okay?

1281
01:04:33,540 --> 01:04:35,170
–瞧瞧 –适合早上

- Of course at night - I mean, can you be more elegant?

1285

可见它实用又优雅
So it's functional Elegant

1286
01:04:43,170 --> 01:04:45,890
你可以单独佩戴 你可以戴着它…我喜欢的一点…
You can wear it alone You can wear it... What I love...

1287
01:04:45,920 --> 01:04:48,090
看到了吗，明星和人们总会犯这个错误
See Stars and people, they always make the mistake

1288
01:04:48,130 --> 01:04:50,130
他们觉得脸才是重要的 并非如此
They think it's about the face, but it's not

1289
01:04:50,180 --> 01:04:51,770
手才是重要的
It's about the hands

1290
01:04:51,800 --> 01:04:53,170
因为人们要用到手
Because that's what people use

1291
01:04:53,220 --> 01:04:55,010
他们用手拿着他们在乎的东西
They hold things they care about

1292
01:04:55,060 --> 01:04:57,520
她的手会成为他们的手
And her hands are gonna become their hands

1293
01:04:57,560 --> 01:04:58,940
会成为他们
And that becomes them

1294
01:04:58,980 --> 01:05:01,440
之后是他们的声音 他们的眼睛
And then their voice, and then their eyes

1295
01:05:01,480 --> 01:05:02,990
明星总是犯这个错
Stars always make the mistake

1296
01:05:03,360 --> 01:05:06,490
手和声音才是至关重要的 才是精髓
It's really about the hands and the voice That's the heart of it

1297
01:05:07,360 --> 01:05:09,570

你需要它，你可以得到它

不过你得现在就打电话

1306
01:05:25,170 --> 01:05:27,670
–我被告知数量有限 –看看打进来的电话
- I'm being told we have limited quantity left - Watch the calls come in

Look at the count I guarantee we're gonna go over twenty

这些是符合联邦贸易委员会规定的 这些是合法的
Those are FTC standards Those are legal

1314

你对你的项链还满意吗？

这些项链太精美了，也不会过时

1328
01:06:13,050 --> 01:06:15,260
–我的曾祖母就有这样的项链 –对对，接着讲
- My great-grandmother had things like this - Y es, yes Keep it going

1329
01:06:15,300 --> 01:06:18,300
买到这些我真是太激动了

1333

–买它不会后悔的 –对，不会
- You will not regret owning this - No, you will not

1334
01:06:28,110 --> 01:06:29,410
看到这些数字了吗？
See those numbers?

1335
01:06:29,440 --> 01:06:31,150
我们要达到两万五千了
We're gonna wind up at 25,000

1336
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:33,900
辛迪知道如何销售
Cindy knows how to close it

1337
01:06:34,160 --> 01:06:35,160
哇
Wow

1338
01:06:36,120 --> 01:06:38,210
我想要你回家，给你的律师打电话
Okay, I want you to go home, I want you to call your lawyer

1339
01:06:38,240 --> 01:06:39,610
看下你的合同
Look at your contract

1340
01:06:39,660 --> 01:06:42,120
确保工厂已经准备就绪
Make sure your product factory is in line

1341
01:06:43,420 --> 01:06:45,300
–好吗？ –好的

好的，祝你好运，祝你顺利 我们走吧，我送你出去
Okay, Godspeed, good luck Here we go I'll walk you out

1343
01:06:48,630 --> 01:06:50,300
鲁迪的卡车和车身

1344
01:06:51,300 --> 01:06:56,020
你不能指望特鲁迪在你还欠她 一万八美元来生产仍未卖掉的拖把时
You can't expect Trudy to write a check for $200,000 for 50,000 mops...

1345
01:06:56,470 --> 01:07:00,350
会为你再开出二十万美元的支票 去生产还没卖出去的五万个拖把
when you already owe her $18,000 to make mops you haven't even sold yet

1346
01:07:01,520 --> 01:07:08,070
你明白有商家想在电视上卖我的拖把吗？
Do you understand that there is a business that wants to sell my mop on television?

1347
01:07:08,110 --> 01:07:09,780
会大卖的
It's going to sell

1348
01:07:10,280 --> 01:07:13,990
好把，如果你坚信这点的话 你出一半的钱
Fine You feel so strongly about it, you put up half the money

1349
01:07:14,280 --> 01:07:17,750
没错，你也要分担财务风险才算公平
Yes It's only fair that you share the financial risk, too

1350
01:07:17,780 --> 01:07:21,240
她如何做到？她一无所有，她没钱
How's she gonna do that? She's got nothing She's got no money

1351
01:07:23,250 --> 01:07:25,920
你们想我把房子再抵押一次吗？
What, do you want me to take out a second mortgage on my house?

1352
01:07:31,050 --> 01:07:33,470
他们想我把房子再抵押一次
They want me to take out a second mortgage on my house

1353
01:07:33,510 --> 01:07:35,060

1354
01:07:35,090 --> 01:07:36,550
但那房子，孩子们，乔伊

1356
01:07:38,800 --> 01:07:39,630
我不知道
I don't know

1357
01:07:54,610 --> 01:07:56,320
–嗨，你好吗？ –嗨
- Hey How you doing? - Hey

1358
01:07:56,360 --> 01:07:58,940
你知道我从你还是个小女孩起 就一直透过栅栏观察你了吗？
You know I've been watching you through that fence since you were a little girl?

1359
01:07:58,990 --> 01:08:00,450
–知道 –我看着你长大

1362
01:08:03,950 --> 01:08:05,780
–你想打几发吗？ –想
- You wanna fire a few rounds? - I do

1363
01:08:05,830 --> 01:08:06,950
好，或许会让你好受些
Yeah Might make you feel better

1364
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:08,130
谢谢，我觉得会
Thank you I think it will

1365
01:08:08,170 --> 01:08:09,800
–你知道怎么拿枪吗？ –对对对
- You know how to hold it? - Yeah Yeah, yeah

1366
01:08:09,840 --> 01:08:11,970

我们这下卖不出去了

1389
01:09:25,910 --> 01:09:27,030
发生什么了？

我很遗憾产品没卖出去
I'm sorry the product didn't sell

1423
01:11:34,500 --> 01:11:37,300
那人都不知道在干什么，尼尔
That man didn't know what he was doing, Neil

1424
01:11:38,880 --> 01:11:42,220
不是他的问题，乔伊 是产品的问题
Well, it wasn't the man, Joy It was the product

1425
01:11:48,350 --> 01:11:51,730

I made 50,000 units because you told me to

To be honest, that's even gonna be hard to get

1430
01:12:09,320 --> 01:12:11,650
尼尔，你要再给我们一次机会

我很抱歉，乔伊

Joy, you have to let Trudy report this loss in bankruptcy...

1436

否则她会失去更多钱
because otherwise she's gonna hemorrhage even more money

1437
01:12:34,560 --> 01:12:36,400
你也得申请破产
You have to file, too...

1438
01:12:36,440 --> 01:12:39,230
因为你抵押了你孩子们的未来 你输了
because you mortgaged your children's future and you lost...

1439
01:12:39,270 --> 01:12:41,770
你得应对这个结果

你得申请破产

Dad, I warned you to not spend her money!

1443

Come on! You've been plotting against her from the very beginning, Peggy!

1444
01:12:50,780 --> 01:12:52,450
现在我们破产了，托尼！
Now we 're bankrupt, Tony!

1445
01:12:54,540 --> 01:12:56,210
我在和我们的律师开会
I'm in a meeting with our lawyers

1446
01:12:56,960 --> 01:12:58,250
你这是干什么？

1447
01:13:00,290 --> 01:13:05,290
“回家去，乔伊，看看电视上的数字
"Go home, Joy, and watch the numbers roll in on television

"borrowing and owing every dollar, including your home"

1450
01:13:13,310 --> 01:13:14,730
可以处理得更好的
It could have been handled better

1451
01:13:14,770 --> 01:13:16,270
我让托德再试一次
I'll let Todd have another shot

1452
01:13:16,310 --> 01:13:19,440
我不想让托德或其他人试
I don't want Todd or anyone else to try it

1453
01:13:19,480 --> 01:13:21,280
应该让我来
It should be me

1454
01:13:21,310 --> 01:13:22,600
我们不让普通人上节目的
We don't have regular people

1455
01:13:22,650 --> 01:13:25,910
都是让明星或推销模特来卖产品
We have celebrities or spokesmodels do the selling

1456
01:13:25,940 --> 01:13:27,400
我告诉过你的
I told you this

1457
01:13:28,280 --> 01:13:29,950
是谁给你演示拖把的？
Who showed you the mop?

1458
01:13:29,990 --> 01:13:32,200
是谁推销给你的？是谁教你用的？
Who sold it to you? Who taught you how to use it?

1459
01:13:32,240 --> 01:13:35,660
是谁在你认为这拖把一无是处之后 说服你的？
And who convinced you that it was great after you thought it was worthless?

1460
01:13:40,670 --> 01:13:42,590
不好意思，能让我们谈一下吗？
Excuse me, can you give us a second?

1461
01:13:43,790 --> 01:13:45,170
跟我来
Come with me

1462
01:13:55,140 --> 01:13:58,230
你上过电视吗？ 你在电视镜头前自在吗？
You ever been in front of a TV camera? You comfortable in front of a TV camera?

1463
01:13:58,270 --> 01:14:02,150
因为当你站上舞台，灯光 镜头和人都会静止
Because when you get there, there's lights and there's camera, and people freeze up

1464
01:14:02,770 --> 01:14:05,810
你跟我说过，大卫塞尔兹尼克，移民后裔
You said to me that David Selznick, the son of immigrants...

1465
01:14:05,860 --> 01:14:09,490
娶了詹妮弗琼斯 一个俄克拉荷马州的美国甜心
married Jennifer Jones, an all-American girl from Oklahoma...

1466
01:14:09,530 --> 01:14:13,500
因为在美国，所有种族和阶层
because in America, all races and all classes...

1467
01:14:13,530 --> 01:14:16,820
都能去追求和把握任何一个机会
can meet and make whatever opportunities they can

1468
01:14:16,870 --> 01:14:22,130
这就是你把产品卖给千家万户时的感觉
And that is what you feel when you reach into people's homes with what you sell

1469
01:14:26,420 --> 01:14:28,180
你是这么说的
You said that

1470
01:14:29,210 --> 01:14:31,840
你觉得呢？看起来很棒，对吧？
What do you think? Looks great, right?

1471
01:14:33,550 --> 01:14:35,420
对对对，好看
Yeah Yeah, yeah Beautiful

1472
01:14:35,470 --> 01:14:36,880
很时髦，很经典
Very vogue, very classic

1473
01:14:37,390 --> 01:14:40,020
好了，如果你下次再来… 洛里？洛里？
All right, if you come back next time... Lori? Lori?

1474
01:14:40,060 --> 01:14:45,150
我就想让你把头发放下来点 就像这样，如果她下次再来的话
I just want you to just put the hair a little bit forward, just like that, if she comes back again

1475
01:14:45,520 --> 01:14:47,810
行吗？不要用梳子，不要梳子
Okay? Not with the comb, not with the comb

1476
01:14:47,860 --> 01:14:49,490
–试试黑色 –好的
- Try the black - Okay

1477
01:14:49,530 --> 01:14:50,780
行吗？
Okay?

1478
01:14:50,820 --> 01:14:51,830
会很完美的
It's gonna be perfect

1479
01:14:54,160 --> 01:14:56,080
更衣室D

1480
01:15:04,580 --> 01:15:05,580

Beautiful What do you think? How do you feel?

1482
01:15:13,090 --> 01:15:15,710
我只想做一个改动，你不介意吗？
I'd like to change just one thing Would you mind?

1483
01:15:16,090 --> 01:15:18,380
–行啊，给我个惊喜吧 –小改动
- Okay, surprise me - Small thing

1484
01:15:18,430 --> 01:15:19,380
我会让你惊喜的
I'll surprise you

1485
01:15:19,430 --> 01:15:20,590
好啊，来吧
Okay, surprise me

1486
01:15:23,560 --> 01:15:26,430
她要做什么小改动？
What would the small thing be that she changes?

1487
01:15:30,440 --> 01:15:31,440
什么？
What?

1488
01:15:31,940 --> 01:15:33,690
你全换掉了

1489
01:15:34,780 --> 01:15:35,740
这才是我
This is me

这才是你？

01:15:37,070 --> 01:15:39,570
你和你进来时穿得一样
You've got the exact same outfit you had when you came in here

1492
01:15:39,620 --> 01:15:41,920
我穿了衬衫和裤子
I wear a blouse and I wear pants

1493
01:15:41,950 --> 01:15:43,620
这就是我
That's who I am

1494
01:15:44,080 --> 01:15:45,740
我想以自己的形象上节目
I want to go on as me

1495
01:15:47,080 --> 01:15:48,410
以你的形象上节目

1496
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:50,670
我希望你能行
I hope you make it back

1497
01:15:51,460 --> 01:15:53,710

1506
01:16:06,730 --> 01:16:08,150

01:16:24,250 --> 01:16:25,670
记住，手才是重点
Just remember, it's all about the hands

1512
01:16:26,670 --> 01:16:27,840
我们开始吧
Here we go

1513
01:16:43,350 --> 01:16:46,360
准备…舞台开转！

01:16:46,770 --> 01:16:51,030

1515
01:16:56,610 --> 01:16:59,030

1516
01:16:59,320 --> 01:17:01,530
说啊！说啊！

1517
01:17:02,990 --> 01:17:04,530
她僵住了
She's freezing

1518
01:17:06,460 --> 01:17:08,960
不好意思，这些灯光太刺眼了
Sorry, these lights are so bright

1519
01:17:11,380 --> 01:17:14,380
没人告诉你这些灯光有多刺眼… 尼尔告诉过我
Nobody tells you how bright these lights... Well, Neil did tell me

1520
01:17:16,380 --> 01:17:19,380

1523
01:17:26,350 --> 01:17:27,480
我是乔伊

1524
01:17:27,520 --> 01:17:30,530
说点什么呀！ 聊拖把！
Just say something! Talk about the mop!

1525
01:17:30,560 --> 01:17:31,680
哦，我的天！
Oh, my God

1526
01:17:31,730 --> 01:17:32,890
我们得做点什么
We have to do something

1527
01:17:34,070 --> 01:17:35,570
我们得做点什么
We have to do something

1528
01:17:36,320 --> 01:17:37,700
有电话进来了吗？
Do we have a call?

1529
01:17:37,740 --> 01:17:38,870
–我们能转电话进来吗？ –有人打进来
- Could we go to a call? - We have a call

1530
01:17:38,900 --> 01:17:40,190

- It's a friendly call? - It's a friendly call

1531
01:17:40,240 --> 01:17:42,410
好，播吧，播吧
Okay Take it Take it

1532
01:17:42,820 --> 01:17:44,030
乔伊，我们有电话进来了
Joy, we have a call

1533
01:17:44,080 --> 01:17:46,210
有电话了？怎么会？
A call? How did that happen?

1534
01:17:47,080 --> 01:17:48,590
好了，我们有电话进来了
Well, we have a call

1535
01:17:48,870 --> 01:17:50,490
嗨，来自纽约的乔安娜
Hi Joanne from New York

1536
01:17:50,540 --> 01:17:51,660
来自纽约的乔安娜
Joanne from New York

1537
01:17:51,710 --> 01:17:54,170
我们有一通纽约的乔安娜打来的电话
We have a call coming in from Joanne from New York

1538
01:17:54,460 --> 01:17:59,040
是的，我打来是想说我想要 一个拖地时不需要拧的拖把
Yeah, I'm calling in because I would love a mop that I don't have to touch when I wring it

1539
01:17:59,090 --> 01:18:02,130
我拖碎玻璃的时候会弄伤手
You know, my hands get raw and when I mop broken glass...

1540
01:18:02,180 --> 01:18:04,930
一拧拖把就会割伤我的手
and I wring the mop, I cut my hands

1541
01:18:06,720 --> 01:18:09,180
你以前拧拖把割伤手过吗？
Do you ever cut your hands when you're wringing?

1542
01:18:09,230 --> 01:18:11,690
乔安娜，你这样说很有趣
Joanne, that is so funny that you said that

1543
01:18:11,730 --> 01:18:16,240
我就是这样才想到发明这款拖把的
That is actually exactly how I was inspired to invent this mop

1544
01:18:16,280 --> 01:18:21,490
满地都是碎玻璃 我有两个孩子，还有父亲，我…
There was glass shattered everywhere I was with my two kids, with my father, and I...

1545
01:18:21,530 --> 01:18:24,790
我每次拧拖把的时候，手都会被玻璃割伤
Every time I would wring the mop, I would get glass shards in my hands

1546
01:18:25,240 --> 01:18:28,410
老式的拖把吸水性也差
And the old mop just wasn't very absorbent

1547
01:18:28,450 --> 01:18:33,660
所以我去我女儿房间，借了她的蜡笔
So I went to my daughter's room, and I borrowed her crayons...

1548
01:18:33,710 --> 01:18:36,300
我就设计了这款拖把
and I designed this mop

1549
01:18:36,960 --> 01:18:38,120
你把镜头放低点，对，就这样
Make sure you get down there Yeah, that's it

1550
01:18:38,510 --> 01:18:40,850
这是塑料做的，所以很轻，但非常耐用
It's made of plastic, so it's lightweight, but very durable

1551
01:18:41,130 --> 01:18:42,500
特写，手部特写
Go in Go in to the hands

1552
01:18:42,550 --> 01:18:43,510
吸水性极好
It's extremely absorbent...

1553
01:18:43,550 --> 01:18:46,090
有91米的连续的全棉线
with 300 continuous cotton loops...

1554
01:18:46,140 --> 01:18:48,480
是我自己缠的
that I looped myself when I designed it

1555
01:18:48,770 --> 01:18:51,770
–多少钱？ –1995美元
- How much is it? - It is $1995

1556
01:18:52,310 --> 01:18:54,310
价格我很满意，我想要买一堆
I like that price I want a whole bunch of them

1557
01:18:55,060 --> 01:18:56,310
谢谢
Thank you

1558
01:18:56,570 --> 01:18:58,530
H375，是货号
H375 That's the order number

1559
01:18:58,570 --> 01:19:00,780
家用产品编号375
Household item 375

1560
01:19:00,820 --> 01:19:01,950
我向你保证…
I guarantee you...

1561
01:19:01,990 --> 01:19:03,280
就在这里，保持住
That's it Stay right there

1562
01:19:03,320 --> 01:19:05,530
…你在市面上可找不到 第二根像这样的拖把
...you are not going to find another mop like this that exists

1563
01:19:05,570 --> 01:19:08,910
如果有的话，我早就会买了 我也不会割伤手了
If there was, I would have bought it and I wouldn't have cut my hands up

1564
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:13,920
你只要拧一次就能拖完整个厨房 想象一下吧
You can get across the whole kitchen with one wring Just imagine that

1565
01:19:13,960 --> 01:19:15,300
看好了
Watch this

1566
01:19:16,500 --> 01:19:17,960
巧克力糖浆
Chocolate syrup

1567
01:19:20,130 --> 01:19:21,420
拍糖浆，拍糖浆
Go the syrup Go the syrup

1568
01:19:21,470 --> 01:19:24,140
婴儿食品 在我家常洒得到处都是
Baby food A very big spill at my house

1569
01:19:24,180 --> 01:19:25,560
对我来说是很常见的污渍
Very common spill for me

1570
01:19:25,590 --> 01:19:27,170
不，用手，用手
No Hands, hands

1571
01:19:27,800 --> 01:19:31,720
最大的区别是 我现在不用碰这个恶心的拖把头了
Now, the biggest difference, I don't have to touch this disgusting mop head

1572
01:19:31,770 --> 01:19:33,770
市面上没有第二款拖把
There's not another mop on the market...

1573
01:19:33,810 --> 01:19:38,480
有吸水性这样强的全棉线
that has as much absorbent cotton as this mop right here

1574
01:19:38,520 --> 01:19:42,440
我向你保证，你不会后悔也不会退货
And I guarantee you, there will be no regrets, no returns

1575
01:19:42,490 --> 01:19:45,660
我一生中几乎每天都要拖地
I have been mopping for most of my life, every single day

1576
01:19:45,700 --> 01:19:46,830
电话进来了！
Phones are ringing!

1577
01:19:46,870 --> 01:19:49,120
这根拖把让我的生活 有了翻天覆地的变化
I cannot tell you how much this mop has changed my life

1578
01:19:49,160 --> 01:19:51,120
–电话进来了！ –有电话进来了！
- Phones are ringing! Phones are ringing! - The phones are ringing The phones are ringing

1579
01:19:51,370 --> 01:19:52,040

1580
01:19:52,290 --> 01:19:55,420
这将会是圣诞假期里最棒的拖把
This is gonna be the greatest mop to have around Christmas time...

1581
01:19:55,460 --> 01:19:57,510
当你全家都来
when you have family over...

1582
01:19:57,540 --> 01:20:01,620
我是两个孩子的母亲 家里经常有东西洒地上
I am a mother of two There is just spill after spill

1583
01:20:01,670 --> 01:20:03,460
家人来做客时
Family comes to town

1584
01:20:03,510 --> 01:20:05,890
你只要拧一次就能拖干净整个厨房
You can mop your entire kitchen with one wring!

1585
01:20:06,130 --> 01:20:08,880
哦，我的天！两万九千个！
Oh, my God! 29,000!

1586
01:20:09,140 --> 01:20:10,770
这太不寻常了！
This is very special!

1587
01:20:10,810 --> 01:20:13,520
我还没告诉你们我个人最喜欢的一个功能
I haven't even told you about my personal favorite feature...

1588
01:20:13,560 --> 01:20:15,690
就是可拆式拖把头
which is the removable mop head...

1589
01:20:15,730 --> 01:20:20,700
我就能把拖把头放进洗衣机 洗完就跟新的一样
that I can put into the washing machine and it will come out clean as new

1590
01:20:20,730 --> 01:20:22,230
太好了！太好了！
Yes! Yes!

1591
01:20:22,280 --> 01:20:24,620
我的天，数字还在不断增大！
Oh, my God, these numbers keep climbing!

1592
01:20:25,570 --> 01:20:26,860
谢谢，我…
Thank you I...

1593
01:20:26,910 --> 01:20:28,240
对，就这样，继续
Yes, that's right Keep it going

1594
01:20:28,280 --> 01:20:29,110
谢谢
Thank you

1595
01:20:30,620 --> 01:20:33,580
这是市面上最吸水的拖把，它很轻
This is the most absorbent mop on the market It's lightweight

1596
01:20:33,620 --> 01:20:37,040
你只需买这一根拖把 这会是你用过的最好的拖把
It's the only mop that you're ever gonna buy, the best mop you're ever gonna use

1597
01:20:37,080 --> 01:20:41,540
又轻又耐用，我只是说出我的体会
It is lightweight and durable, and that is just me speaking from my experience

1598
01:20:41,590 --> 01:20:45,640
作为一个每天要拖地清洁家的人 发自内心的话
As someone who mops their house every single day, from my heart

1599
01:20:46,970 --> 01:20:50,100
这女人会是一个全新的商机
This woman's gonna be a whole new business

1600
01:20:51,970 --> 01:20:52,970
不会吧
No way

1601
01:20:58,400 --> 01:20:59,730
哦，我的天
Oh, my God

1602
01:21:19,920 --> 01:21:23,470
你能相信吗？ 你能相信吗？
Can you believe it? Can you believe it?

1603
01:21:23,500 --> 01:21:27,000
我以为你肯定会告诉我统计机器坏了
I thought for sure you were gonna tell me that your counting machine was broken

1604
01:21:27,050 --> 01:21:28,810
我听了你的话，你是对的
I listened to you You were right

1605
01:21:28,840 --> 01:21:31,460
我就是不敢相信竟能成真
I just can't believe that actually happened

1606
01:21:31,510 --> 01:21:32,630
我知道
I know

1607
01:21:32,680 --> 01:21:35,230
我想你能说我们是生意场上的朋友了
I guess you could say we're friends in commerce

1608
01:21:35,270 --> 01:21:36,440
生意上场的朋友
Friends in commerce

1609
01:21:36,480 --> 01:21:37,440
对
Yeah

1610
01:21:37,480 --> 01:21:41,110
我们互相保证，即使有一天 如果会有那一天
Let's promise each other that if, one day, and that day may come...

1611
01:21:41,150 --> 01:21:44,610
我们是彼此生意的对手 我们还是朋友
that we become adversaries in commerce, that we remain friends

1612
01:21:44,650 --> 01:21:46,410
因为那才是真正的友谊
Because that's a true friendship indeed

1613
01:21:46,440 --> 01:21:47,690
生意场上的朋友
Friends in commerce

1614
01:21:48,320 --> 01:21:50,330
我同意，握手吧
I agree Let's shake on it

1615
01:22:31,070 --> 01:22:33,030
我们有十台织布机
We've got 10 looms...

1616
01:22:33,070 --> 01:22:36,610
织好布后，会在这里缝拖把头
and then when they're completed, this is where the mop heads are sewn

1617
01:22:38,830 --> 01:22:40,170
谁生产你的其他部件？
Who makes your parts?

1618
01:22:40,660 --> 01:22:42,490
加利福尼亚州的一家工厂
A factory out in California

1619
01:22:42,540 --> 01:22:45,370
比这里任何一家都便宜而且高效
It was cheaper and faster than any place around here

1620
01:22:45,420 --> 01:22:47,760
很聪明，他们能按时交货吗？
Smart Are they gonna be able to stay on schedule?

1621
01:22:49,210 --> 01:22:50,040
能
Yeah

1622
01:22:57,220 --> 01:22:58,430
一次
One time

1623
01:23:18,120 --> 01:23:19,250
–那里 –谢谢
- Right there - Thank you

1624
01:23:19,290 --> 01:23:20,330
–不客气 –这里？
- You're welcome - Right here?

1625
01:23:22,250 --> 01:23:23,040
喂？
Hello?

1626
01:24:24,310 --> 01:24:25,440
外婆
Mimi

1627
01:24:28,270 --> 01:24:29,350
外婆
Mimi

1628
01:24:44,620 --> 01:24:46,990
我很气自己那天离她而去
I so hated to leave her that day

1629
01:24:48,210 --> 01:24:50,800
我有好多话想对她说
I had so much I wanted to say to her

1630
01:24:51,710 --> 01:24:53,750
对我的曾孙女
And to my great granddaughter

1631
01:24:56,510 --> 01:25:01,560
我觉得我要待在她身边，守护她
I felt I wanted to stay near her and watch over her

1632
01:26:07,660 --> 01:26:09,280
克里斯蒂
Cristy

1633
01:26:15,420 --> 01:26:17,380
加利福尼亚那边有个问题
There's a problem in California

1634
01:26:17,420 --> 01:26:21,630
加利福尼亚不能出问题 我跟尼尔说了一切都好
There can't be a problem in California I told Neil that everything was fine

1635
01:26:21,680 --> 01:26:24,810
杰哈德不断提价，他又提价了
Gerhardt keeps raising his price He just did it again

1636
01:26:24,850 --> 01:26:25,850
每把的成本提高了
More money per unit

1637
01:26:27,220 --> 01:26:29,300
他不能那样，我们会亏损的
He can't do that We're gonna lose money

1638
01:26:29,350 --> 01:26:31,470
我派了一个代表去搞定他
I sent a representative to handle him

1639
01:26:32,690 --> 01:26:34,650
代表？我们没有代表
Representative? We don't have a representative

1640
01:26:34,690 --> 01:26:36,240
什么代表？
What representative?

1641
01:26:36,780 --> 01:26:37,990
佩吉去了
Peggy went

1642
01:26:38,280 --> 01:26:39,410
佩吉？
Peggy?

1643
01:26:43,870 --> 01:26:45,830
我现在不想谈这个
I don't want to talk about this right now

1644
01:26:54,840 --> 01:26:56,220
她想参与进来
She wanted to be part of it

1645
01:26:56,250 --> 01:26:58,250
你怎么能派佩吉去？
How could you send Peggy?

1646
01:27:02,930 --> 01:27:04,890
她想参与进来
She wanted to be part of it

1647
01:27:05,720 --> 01:27:09,930
你们有血缘关系，你们是同父异母的姐妹
You both are blood relatives You're half-sisters

1648
01:27:09,980 --> 01:27:13,730
你们相爱，互相尊重，这点非常非常重要
It's very, very important that you love and respect each other

1649
01:27:16,230 --> 01:27:20,520
我付了你欠他们的两万，我是迫不得已
I paid them the 20 that you owed them I had to

1650
01:27:22,280 --> 01:27:25,910
我让它们完成十万的订单
I got them to fill the order of the 100,000...

1651
01:27:25,950 --> 01:27:28,580
每把只加收两美元
with a price increase of only two dollars per unit

1652
01:27:28,620 --> 01:27:33,210
我们一分也不能多付了，佩吉 你不明白吗？
We can't increase at all, Peggy Don't you understand?

1653
01:27:35,500 --> 01:27:38,210
我们以一定的价格销售
We sold at a certain price

1654
01:27:39,050 --> 01:27:42,800
任何成本的提升，尤其是他要求的
Any hikes, especially the ones he's asking for...

1655
01:27:42,840 --> 01:27:44,800
意味着我要损失很多钱
mean that I will lose so much money...

1656
01:27:44,840 --> 01:27:49,090
以至于会欠下比之前还要多的债
that I'll be in even more debt than I was before

1657
01:27:51,140 --> 01:27:52,720
你会赚回来的
You're gonna make it back

1658
01:27:53,560 --> 01:27:55,680
我要赚回来？
I'm gonna make it back?

1659
01:27:56,520 --> 01:27:57,520
怎么赚？
How?

1660
01:28:02,690 --> 01:28:04,770
我有些想法
I've got ideas, you know

1661
01:28:06,780 --> 01:28:09,200
我有一些想要做的事
There are things that I'd like to do

1662
01:28:09,240 --> 01:28:13,030
我跟他谈了我和爸爸在设想的项目
I spoke to him about a project that Dad and I have been designing

1663
01:28:13,080 --> 01:28:14,380
对吧，爸爸？
Right, Dad?

1664
01:28:14,410 --> 01:28:15,870
对的，我们在设想
Yes, we did

1665
01:28:18,040 --> 01:28:22,830
你知道你的想法要花多少钱吗？
Do you have any idea how much your idea will cost?

1666
01:28:22,880 --> 01:28:24,960
你怎么卖？去哪里卖？
How or where you'll sell it?

1667
01:28:25,630 --> 01:28:28,880
即使你能把产品生产出来
If you can even manufacture it after it's taken everything we've got...

1668
01:28:28,930 --> 01:28:32,560
在我们现在倾其所有 销售这一件产品之后，托你的福
to sell this one product that now, thanks to you...

1669
01:28:32,600 --> 01:28:34,610
要花更多的钱？
is going to cost more money?

1670
01:28:35,230 --> 01:28:38,070
也许我的产品比你的好
Maybe my product is better than your product

1671
01:28:38,110 --> 01:28:40,650
我也能做你在电视上的那些，又不是很难
I can do what you did on TV It's not that hard

1672
01:28:40,690 --> 01:28:44,310
这难道不是那个频道的宗旨？ 任何人都可以做？
Isn't that the whole purpose of that channel? It's that everybody could do it?

1673
01:28:45,530 --> 01:28:50,500
你妹妹做的那些可不容易
What your sister does is not easy...

1674
01:28:50,530 --> 01:28:54,490
但是我们打算做的
but what we were planning to do...

1675
01:28:54,540 --> 01:28:58,210
也不是那么难
is not that difficult

1676
01:28:59,250 --> 01:29:01,000
听我说
Listen to me

1677
01:29:01,960 --> 01:29:07,420
再也不要以我的名义谈
Never speak on my behalf...

1678
01:29:10,100 --> 01:29:13,480
我的生意
about my business again

1679
01:29:15,430 --> 01:29:18,100
现在我得去一趟加利福尼亚了
Now I have to go to California

1680
01:29:54,260 --> 01:29:58,220
请进

1681
01:30:04,820 --> 01:30:09,830
引以为傲的商品 由帕克制造厂所有和制造

1682
01:30:19,250 --> 01:30:20,590
我有什么可帮你的吗？
Can I help you?

1683
01:30:20,620 --> 01:30:22,620
我是乔伊，我来见杰哈德
I'm Joy I'm here to see Gerhardt

1684
01:30:23,340 --> 01:30:24,800
他没空
He's not available

1685
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:27,170
我会等
I'll wait

1686
01:30:30,630 --> 01:30:32,880
她说她来见杰哈德
She says she's here to see Gerhardt

1687
01:30:33,850 --> 01:30:34,850
杰哈德！
Gerhardt!

1688
01:30:42,690 --> 01:30:44,780
嗨，我是杰哈德
Hey I'm Gerhardt

1689
01:30:44,820 --> 01:30:46,320
我是乔伊
I'm Joy

1690
01:30:46,360 --> 01:30:47,740
请进
Come on in

1691
01:30:47,780 --> 01:30:49,200
德里克马卡姆是我的老板
Derek Markham is my boss

1692
01:30:49,240 --> 01:30:50,490
他住在德克萨斯州
He lives in Texas

1693
01:30:50,530 --> 01:30:54,910
帕克制造厂只是他拥有的或 收专利费的其中一家公司而已
Fabri-Pac is one of several companies he owns or collects royalties for

1694
01:30:54,950 --> 01:30:58,460
我向他汇报，他定价格
I report to him He makes pricing decisions

1695
01:30:58,500 --> 01:31:01,630
我从没见过 也没和这个德里克马卡姆谈过
Well, I've never met or talked to this Derek Markham...

1696
01:31:01,670 --> 01:31:03,460
但我和你在电话谈过好多次了
but I've talked to you many times on the phone

1697
01:31:03,500 --> 01:31:05,040
我很好奇
And I do find it very curious...

1698
01:31:05,090 --> 01:31:08,180
我上电视大获成功后
that the second I'm on television, with a lot of success...

1699
01:31:08,210 --> 01:31:10,630
我们产品的造价就涨了
the price for our products goes up

1700
01:31:10,670 --> 01:31:13,300
至少对我来说，这很不公平
Seems very unfair to me, to say the least

1701
01:31:14,010 --> 01:31:16,380
你们似乎是在压榨我们
Seems like you're shaking us down

1702
01:31:16,430 --> 01:31:18,850
你见过格里高利了，我们的工头
You met Gregory, our plant foreman

1703
01:31:18,890 --> 01:31:21,180
我们现在很难降低成本
It's very hard for us to lower the cost at this point

1704
01:31:21,690 --> 01:31:23,980
我们已经亏了很多钱
We're already losing a lot of money

1705
01:31:24,020 --> 01:31:27,190
怎么会呢，除了预付给达拉斯的 德里克马卡姆的
How could that possibly be, with the $500,000 that we've given you...

1706
01:31:27,230 --> 01:31:29,520
五万美元专利费
on top of the $50,000 of advance royalties...

1707
01:31:29,570 --> 01:31:32,830
我们还支付给你们50万美元
that have gone to a Derek Markham in Dallas

1708
01:31:32,860 --> 01:31:35,110
更别说我姐姐付了你们的那笔
And that's not even counting what my sister paid you...

1709
01:31:35,160 --> 01:31:36,830
因为你们多收费和出错产生的费用
without my authority, by the way...

1710
01:31:36,870 --> 01:31:39,580
顺便说下，还是未经我授权的
for your overcharges and your mistakes

1711
01:31:40,330 --> 01:31:43,920
你姐姐付了你拒绝支付的涨价部分
Your sister paid the increase that you refused to pay

1712
01:31:44,290 --> 01:31:48,120
她没权这样做，她根本不是我公司的一员
Well, she had no authority to do that She's not an officer of my corporation

1713
01:31:49,130 --> 01:31:53,640
我们可以花很多时间和钱去法庭 证明我是对的
You and I could both spend a lot of time and money in court to prove that I'm right...

1714
01:31:54,800 --> 01:31:56,510
但那只会让我们的律师更富有
but that would just make our lawyers wealthy...

1715
01:31:56,550 --> 01:31:59,090
与此同时我的产品却停产 不能上电视
while my product dies instead of being on television...

1716
01:31:59,140 --> 01:32:00,940
就像现在这样
like it could be right now

1717
01:32:02,020 --> 01:32:03,650
你可以付更多钱
You can pay more

1718
01:32:04,140 --> 01:32:06,890
我付不了更多，我不会
I can't pay more I won't

1719
01:32:06,940 --> 01:32:09,860
成本更高了，模具有损耗
Costs are higher Wear and tear on the molds

1720
01:32:09,900 --> 01:32:11,990
我们每隔一周都要重做一次
We have to remake them every other week

1721
01:32:12,030 --> 01:32:14,990
是吗？我能看看模具吗？
Is that so? Can I see the molds?

1722
01:32:15,030 --> 01:32:16,570
它们在机器里
They're in the machines

1723
01:32:16,620 --> 01:32:19,460
给你看需要花些时间
It'll take some time to prepare them for you

1724
01:32:24,410 --> 01:32:26,410
我能用下洗手间吗？
Is there a bathroom I could use?

1725
01:32:29,630 --> 01:32:31,930
可以，走廊走到底 格里高利会带你去
Yeah, it's down the hall Gregory will show you

1726
01:32:40,100 --> 01:32:41,190
谢谢
Thanks

1727
01:33:56,170 --> 01:34:01,510
帕克制造厂专利 自己拧干拖把模具

1728
01:34:02,180 --> 01:34:03,310
什么？
What?

1729
01:34:07,140 --> 01:34:08,680
你在这里干什么？
What are you doing in here?

1730
01:34:09,310 --> 01:34:10,720
这是什么？
What is this?

1731
01:34:10,770 --> 01:34:13,770
这些是我的设计图，是我的模具！
These are my designs, these are my molds!

1732
01:34:13,820 --> 01:34:14,950
那些是我们的！
Those are ours!

1733
01:34:14,980 --> 01:34:17,060
我们就知道你是个麻烦 警察已经在路上了
And we knew you'd be trouble The cops are on their way

1734
01:34:17,110 --> 01:34:19,360
–你一来我们就报警了 –这些是我的模具！
- We called 'em as soon as you showed up! - These are my molds!

1735
01:34:19,400 --> 01:34:20,610
是我们的！
Those are ours!

1736
01:34:20,660 --> 01:34:22,540
我要把这些带走
I'm taking these with me

1737
01:34:22,780 --> 01:34:24,110
我要把这些全部带走
I'm taking all of these with me

1738
01:34:24,160 --> 01:34:26,580
我要把这些都打包，我要带走它们
I want all of these boxed up, and I'm taking them

1739
01:34:26,620 --> 01:34:27,880
你非法入侵！
You're trespassing!

1740
01:34:27,910 --> 01:34:29,160
这不是你们的专利！
It's not your patent!

1741
01:34:29,620 --> 01:34:31,540
这些是我的设计！
These are my designs!

1742
01:34:32,880 --> 01:34:35,220
不带走我的模具我哪也不会去
I'm not going anywhere without my molds

1743
01:34:36,130 --> 01:34:37,840
什么？不，不
What? No No

1744
01:34:37,880 --> 01:34:40,300
这不是偷窃，这是我的财产！
This is not stealing, this is my property!

1745
01:34:40,340 --> 01:34:41,590
这是我的财产！
This is my property

1746
01:34:41,640 --> 01:34:45,060
我拥有这些设计图，这些都是我的 它们属于我！
I have all of these designs These are all mine They belong to me!

1747
01:34:45,100 --> 01:34:48,860
她来自别的州，约翰！你认识我15年了！
She's from out of state, John! You've known me 15 years!

1748
01:34:48,890 --> 01:34:50,640
好了，走吧，女士，你非法入侵了
All right, come on, ma'am You're trespassing

1749
01:34:50,690 --> 01:34:52,400
–什么？ –对，走吧
- What? - Yeah Come on

1750
01:34:52,440 --> 01:34:53,940
–我没有非法入侵 –不，你非法入侵了
- I'm not trespassing - Yeah, you're trespassing

1751
01:34:53,980 --> 01:34:55,100
我之前在他的办公室
I was in his office

1752
01:34:55,150 --> 01:34:56,650
–我不知道，走吧 –他让我进他的…
- You don't know Come on - He let me into his...

1753
01:34:56,690 --> 01:34:58,190
杰哈德，我不会放过你的
Gerhardt, you're not gonna get away with this

1754
01:34:58,240 --> 01:34:59,780
–我不会放过你的！ –说话小心点
- You're not gonna get away with this! - Be careful what you're saying

1755
01:34:59,820 --> 01:35:01,870
–你是个小偷！杰哈德！ –当心，走吧
- You're a thief! You're a thief, Gerhardt! - Be careful, come on, come on

1756
01:35:01,910 --> 01:35:03,240
当心，走吧，停住
Be careful Come on, stop it

1757
01:35:03,280 --> 01:35:05,490
–这是偷窃！ –嗨嗨，别嚷嚷了，走吧
- This is stealing! - Hey, hey, stop it Come on

1758
01:35:05,530 --> 01:35:06,530
好吧
All right

1759
01:35:09,620 --> 01:35:11,580
小心脚下，好吧
Watch your step All right

1760
01:35:19,670 --> 01:35:21,040
特鲁迪的钱呢，乔伊？
What about Trudy's money, Joy?

1761
01:35:21,090 --> 01:35:23,210
你得还特鲁迪的钱
You have to pay back Trudy's money

1762
01:35:23,260 --> 01:35:24,890
只会变得越来越糟
This is only getting worse

1763
01:35:24,930 --> 01:35:26,810
我觉得势头不妙，乔伊
I predicted tragedy, Joy

1764
01:35:27,260 --> 01:35:29,300
你欠下了一大笔债
You're racking up quite a steep bill

1765
01:35:29,350 --> 01:35:32,610
我们还不得不飞来这里保释你
We had to fly out here, bail you out

1766
01:35:32,640 --> 01:35:35,770
再加上我们额外支付了雷贾克内 一万美元
Plus it cost us an extra $10,000 for Ray Cagney...

1767
01:35:35,810 --> 01:35:38,310
这位加利福尼亚的专利律师 帮我们到这份上
this California patent attorney, to get us to this point

1768
01:35:38,360 --> 01:35:40,990
我们让州政府撤销了指控
We got the state to decline prosecution

1769
01:35:41,030 --> 01:35:43,240
他们认为这是一起合同纠纷
They see it's a contract dispute

1770
01:35:43,280 --> 01:35:46,910
当你给德克萨斯的德里克马卡姆 付专利费时
When you paid royalties to Derek Markham in T exas...

1771
01:35:46,950 --> 01:35:50,990
你就把所有零部件和模具 归到他们的专利里了
it put all your parts and molds under the umbrella of their patent

1772
01:35:51,960 --> 01:35:55,210
我看你带了你的设计图 想证明这是你的设计
I see you brought your drawings and hung them to prove your design

1773
01:35:55,250 --> 01:35:57,870
但现在没法起诉他们
But it's impossible to fight it now

1774
01:35:57,920 --> 01:36:00,390
你没得到正确的法律咨询
You were not properly advised

1775
01:36:01,720 --> 01:36:03,220
克里斯蒂，别闹了！
Cristy, please!

1776
01:36:03,260 --> 01:36:04,390
托尼，带她去睡觉
Tony, take her to bed

1777
01:36:04,430 --> 01:36:06,640
我不想睡觉，我想待在这里
I don't wanna go to bed I wanna stay here

1778
01:36:06,680 --> 01:36:08,180
我付那些专利费
I paid those royalties...

1779
01:36:08,220 --> 01:36:09,340
是因为你让我付的
because you told me to

1780
01:36:09,390 --> 01:36:12,230
因为你的律师让我付的
Because your lawyer told me to

1781
01:36:12,270 --> 01:36:16,150
我们的律师弄错了 生意上有时会发生这种事
Our lawyer was mistaken This happens sometimes in business

1782
01:36:16,190 --> 01:36:17,530
你运气不太好
It didn't work out for you

1783
01:36:17,560 --> 01:36:18,730
有时是会发生这样的事
It happens sometimes

1784
01:36:18,770 --> 01:36:20,230
特鲁迪的律师不是专利律师
Trudy's lawyer is not a patent attorney

1785
01:36:20,280 --> 01:36:21,740
我就是那么说的！
Which I said!

1786
01:36:21,780 --> 01:36:25,870
而你说我没资格给乔伊提建议
And you said I had no business being Joy's advisor

1787
01:36:25,910 --> 01:36:27,790
–现在证明我是对的了！ –你这是帮倒忙，托尼！
- And now it turns out that I was right! - This is not helpful, Tony!

1788
01:36:27,820 --> 01:36:29,860
–够了，托尼，拜托 –哦，现在够了？
- That's enough, Tony Please - It's enough, now?

1789
01:36:29,910 --> 01:36:32,670
我很抱歉 我希望我能帮上什么忙
I'm very sorry I wish there was more I could do

1790
01:36:32,700 --> 01:36:35,950
但是当你姐姐佩吉付了你拒绝支付的
But when your sister Peggy paid the unjustified bills...

1791
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:37,840
不公正的账单后
that you refused to pay...

1792
01:36:37,880 --> 01:36:39,470
就已经没办法了
it closed the door on that

1793
01:36:39,500 --> 01:36:41,330
尼尔沃克和QVC怎么办？
What about Neil Walker and QVC?

1794
01:36:41,380 --> 01:36:43,890
他们不会支付争夺专利的费用吗？
Wouldn't they pay the expenses on defending the patent?

1795
01:36:44,630 --> 01:36:45,750
小心点，乔伊
Be careful, Joy

1796
01:36:45,800 --> 01:36:49,510
你可能会因对产品的虚假陈述 和未能交付而被起诉
You could be sued for misrepresentation and failure to deliver your product

1797
01:36:49,560 --> 01:36:50,560
这是毁灭性的
That's breach

1798
01:36:51,520 --> 01:36:54,900
QVC要求你交付有完全专利权的产品
QVC requires that you deliver a fully patented product

1799
01:36:54,940 --> 01:36:57,440
我干这一行很久了
I've been doing this for a long time

1800
01:36:57,480 --> 01:37:01,570
你会面临漫长的法庭程序 会导致产品停产
You're in for a long court process that will stall your product

1801
01:37:01,610 --> 01:37:03,200
而且你还可能败诉
And you will probably lose

1802
01:37:03,240 --> 01:37:04,660
我希望我能帮上更多忙
I wish I could do more

1803
01:37:06,280 --> 01:37:07,830
保重
Take care, now

1804
01:37:07,870 --> 01:37:10,210
你得接受现实，乔伊
You're gonna have to accept the facts, Joy

1805
01:37:10,240 --> 01:37:11,700
我是说，这…
I mean, that's...

1806
01:37:12,330 --> 01:37:14,420
你差不多欠了五十万美元的债了
You're most of half a million dollars in debt

1807
01:37:14,450 --> 01:37:16,280
我不知道你要怎么偿还
I don't know how you're gonna pay it

1808
01:37:16,670 --> 01:37:18,460
我们得宣布破产
We have to declare bankruptcy

1809
01:37:18,500 --> 01:37:20,910
你得宣布破产
You're gonna have to declare bankruptcy

1810
01:37:21,300 --> 01:37:22,590
我得宣布破产
I have to declare bankruptcy

1811
01:37:22,630 --> 01:37:23,760
她必须得这样
She has to

1812
01:37:23,800 --> 01:37:25,350
–以防我进一步的损失 –对
- To try to contain my losses - Yeah

1813
01:37:25,380 --> 01:37:26,670
我得把损失匀回来
I have to write it off

1814
01:37:26,720 --> 01:37:28,770
这样很不对
It just seems so wrong

1815
01:37:28,800 --> 01:37:30,420
我们那么努力
We've worked so hard

1816
01:37:30,470 --> 01:37:32,680
我们一路经历了那么多，现在就放弃的话
We've come so far for us to just give up now

1817
01:37:32,720 --> 01:37:34,300
太不公平了
It just seems so unfair!

1818
01:37:34,350 --> 01:37:36,980
生意场上何来公平，现实就是这样
Business is unfair That's it

1819
01:37:37,020 --> 01:37:39,150
只是没做成，这种事时有发生
It's not working out Well, that's what happens

1820
01:37:39,190 --> 01:37:43,030
所以人们不会每天 没事就发明件东西
That's why people don't go around making invention every other day

1821
01:37:43,070 --> 01:37:44,160
清醒吧！
Wake up!

1822
01:37:44,190 --> 01:37:45,310
都是我的错
It's my fault

1823
01:37:45,360 --> 01:37:48,270
是我给她信心，让她认为自己远不止是 在垃圾频道上
I gave her the confidence to think she was more than just an unemployed housewife...

1824
01:37:48,320 --> 01:37:51,150
卖塑料厨房用具给其他失业家庭主妇的
selling plastic kitchen stuff to other unemployed housewives...

1825
01:37:51,200 --> 01:37:52,410
一个失业家庭主妇
on a junk cable channel

1826
01:37:52,450 --> 01:37:55,280
是我的错，不是你的错，亲爱的
It's my fault It's not your fault, honey

1827
01:37:55,330 --> 01:37:57,840
是我让她误以为能超越自己
It was my mistake to make her think that she was more than she was

1828
01:37:58,420 --> 01:38:01,010
她强迫自己做了她本不该做的事
She pressured herself into doing something she shouldn't have done

1829
01:38:01,040 --> 01:38:03,210
你不该给自己压力的
It was wrong of you to put that pressure on yourself

1830
01:38:03,250 --> 01:38:05,580
我们不该给你那样的压力
It was wrong of us to put that pressure on you

1831
01:38:05,630 --> 01:38:07,210
我需要更多伏特加
I need more vodka

1832
01:38:07,260 --> 01:38:12,980
我们不该认为你会在一夜之间 就成为出色的商人
It was wrong of us to think that you'd be an instant business person overnight

1833
01:38:13,010 --> 01:38:15,550
当然，那不是你
Of course, this is not who you are

1834
01:38:16,520 --> 01:38:21,610
那需要坚强和一些头脑
It takes a kind of toughness, a certain acumen...

1835
01:38:21,650 --> 01:38:24,450
显然你都不具备
that you simply don't have

1836
01:38:25,110 --> 01:38:26,450
把文书签了
Sign the paper

1837
01:38:30,990 --> 01:38:33,580
你得签这些宣告破产的文书，亲爱的
You have to sign these bankruptcy papers, honey

1838
01:38:33,620 --> 01:38:36,170
公证师就在外面，我去叫她
The notary's right outside Let me get her

1839
01:38:40,210 --> 01:38:42,300
你得立即搬出你的房子
You're gonna have to move out of your house immediately

1840
01:38:43,210 --> 01:38:44,630
你得搬去公寓住
You're gonna have to move into an apartment

1841
01:38:45,380 --> 01:38:47,590
也许能搬进特鲁迪家的一间房间
Maybe you can move into a room in Trudy's house

1842
01:38:47,630 --> 01:38:48,880
和孩子们一起？
With the children?

1843
01:38:48,920 --> 01:38:50,300
对，你有空房间
Yeah You have room

1844
01:38:51,220 --> 01:38:52,640
她是我的女儿，有什么不行的呢？
She's my daughter Why not?

1845
01:38:53,930 --> 01:38:55,520
我们谈谈吧
Let's talk about it

1846
01:38:56,010 --> 01:38:57,640
特鲁迪，我们得给她点什么
Trudy, we have to offer her something

1847
01:38:57,680 --> 01:38:58,800
还要给？
Again?

1848
01:38:58,850 --> 01:39:00,060
为什么要我给？
Why me?

1849
01:39:07,690 --> 01:39:09,440
请签名，亲爱的
Please sign, honey

1850
01:39:35,760 --> 01:39:36,880
谢谢
Thank you

1851
01:39:40,640 --> 01:39:45,060
太婆说你是为振兴家族而生的人
Mimi said you were the one born to help carry the family to success

1852
01:39:48,570 --> 01:39:51,410
不，克里斯蒂，太婆错了
No, Cristy Mimi was wrong

1853
01:39:52,820 --> 01:39:55,190
世界不给你机会
The world does not give you opportunities

1854
01:39:55,240 --> 01:39:59,990
世界毁了你的机会，让你伤心欲绝
The world destroys your opportunity and it breaks your heart

1855
01:40:00,660 --> 01:40:04,410
我十岁的时候就该听我妈妈的话
I should have listened to my mother when I was 10 years old

1856
01:40:04,460 --> 01:40:06,130
我就该像我妈妈一样
I should have spent the rest of my life...

1857
01:40:06,170 --> 01:40:09,220
在看电视和逃避世界中度过一生
watching TV and hiding from the world like my mother

1858
01:40:10,130 --> 01:40:12,710
所以我不想再听到太婆说的话了
So I don't wanna hear any more about Mimi

1859
01:40:13,300 --> 01:40:14,470
她错了
She was wrong

1860
01:40:14,510 --> 01:40:18,060
她异想天开，脑子里都是些愚蠢的想法
She had her head in the clouds and it was full of stupid ideas

1861
01:40:18,100 --> 01:40:20,270
致使我也有了愚蠢的想法
And it gave me stupid ideas

1862
01:40:22,810 --> 01:40:23,820
就像这个
Like this

1863
01:40:26,650 --> 01:40:28,820
这个愚蠢，愚蠢的想法！
This stupid, stupid idea!

1864
01:40:31,780 --> 01:40:34,330
妈咪，不要撕掉它们！不要！
Mommy, don't tear them! No!

1865
01:40:56,090 --> 01:40:58,340
克里斯蒂，我非常抱歉
Cristy, I'm so sorry

1866
01:40:58,390 --> 01:41:00,600
抱歉，克里斯蒂
I'm sorry, Cristy

1867
01:41:00,640 --> 01:41:02,310
我非常抱歉
I'm so sorry

1868
01:41:02,350 --> 01:41:04,810
去睡觉吧 大家都去睡觉吧
Please go to bed Everybody just go to bed

1869
01:41:06,190 --> 01:41:07,940
晚安，妈咪
Good night, Mommy

1870
01:41:07,980 --> 01:41:10,150
晚安，甜心，去睡觉吧
Good night, sweetheart Just go to bed

1871
01:41:12,730 --> 01:41:15,230
让你失望了，我非常抱歉，乔伊 我非常抱歉
I'm so sorry I failed you, Joy I'm so sorry

1872
01:41:15,490 --> 01:41:17,080
别，别说了
Just, just don't

1873
01:42:48,790 --> 01:42:51,000
乔伊？乔伊？
Joy? Joy?

1874
01:42:51,670 --> 01:42:53,090
乔伊，你在哪里？
Joy, where are you?

1875
01:42:55,090 --> 01:42:56,840
乔伊，你在哪里？
Joy, where are you?

1876
01:43:07,770 --> 01:43:10,610
德克萨斯州 达拉斯最棒的烧烤店

1877
01:43:30,330 --> 01:43:33,660
巴特利特旅馆

1878
01:44:10,540 --> 01:44:11,840
门开着
It's open

1879
01:44:19,590 --> 01:44:20,930
你可以开着门
You can leave the door open

1880
01:44:46,870 --> 01:44:48,870
没人知道我在这里
No one knows I'm here

1881
01:44:49,870 --> 01:44:52,040
你甚至都不知道我是谁
You don't even know who I am

1882
01:44:52,080 --> 01:44:57,590
我可能是德里克马卡姆 或是他派来搞定你的人
I could be Derek Markham or I might be someone Derek Markham sent to handle you

1883
01:44:58,090 --> 01:45:00,090
你没办法起诉我们
You have no case

1884
01:45:00,590 --> 01:45:04,600
也许人们认为你来达拉斯 是急于结束自己的生命
Maybe people think you came to Dallas in despair to take your own life...

1885
01:45:04,630 --> 01:45:09,550
因为你在野心勃勃的冒险途中 突然陷入了财务困境
because you were in such deep financial trouble suddenly from your little venture

1886
01:45:16,230 --> 01:45:19,530
我今早打了通电话去香港
I made a phone call this morning to Hong Kong

1887
01:45:20,190 --> 01:45:25,360
当时是加利福尼亚的凌晨一点 但已经是香港的第二天下午五点
It was 1:00 am in California but it was 5:00 pm the following afternoon in Hong Kong

1888
01:45:25,400 --> 01:45:29,740
我总是觉得时差很神奇
I always think it's amazing how time works like that

1889
01:45:31,450 --> 01:45:34,740
我有幸与克里斯托夫先生通上了电话
And I was fortunate enough to get on the phone with Mr Christopher...

1890
01:45:34,790 --> 01:45:37,960
他很友善，挺出乎意料
who I found to be very friendly, which was surprising...

1891
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:41,260
因为我没在加利福尼亚 遇到一个友好的先生
because I really haven't found the gentlemen in California to be very nice...

1892
01:45:41,300 --> 01:45:43,800
考虑到我们还有生意往来
considering we're all in business together

1893
01:45:43,840 --> 01:45:47,640
欢迎来到生意场吧，我想
Welcome to the world of business, I guess

1894
01:45:48,680 --> 01:45:51,060
我告诉克里斯托夫先生，我打电话是来
I told Mr Christopher that the reason that I was calling...

1895
01:45:51,100 --> 01:45:55,110
探讨我们产品之间的设计差异
was to discuss the differences in the designs of our products

1896
01:45:55,770 --> 01:46:00,240
但是我很快意识到克里斯托夫先生 并不知道
But I quickly learned that Mr Christopher has no idea...

1897
01:46:00,270 --> 01:46:06,440
他的自己拧干拖把的香港专利是否值钱 甚至也不知道是否起作用
if his Hong Kong patent for a self-wringing mop is worth anything or if it even works

1898
01:46:07,070 --> 01:46:12,110
因为他们没有生产或卖出一根拖把
Because they have not made or sold a single mop

1899
01:46:12,410 --> 01:46:16,130
不像我们，卖出了超过二十万根
Unlike us, who have sold over 200,000

1900
01:46:17,290 --> 01:46:22,170
而且我付了你五万多的专利费
And I've paid you over $50,000 in advanced royalties...

1901
01:46:22,210 --> 01:46:24,170
以付给克里斯托夫的名义
on behalf of Mr Christopher

1902
01:46:24,710 --> 01:46:29,630
那是我家人的血汗钱和 我二次抵押房产筹得的钱
Blood money from my family and my second mortgage

1903
01:46:30,890 --> 01:46:35,310
结果发现克里斯托夫先生对专利费 并不知情
Turns out Mr Christopher doesn't know anything about those royalties

1904
01:46:35,350 --> 01:46:36,810
所以似乎
So it seems...

1905
01:46:37,980 --> 01:46:41,610
我们能以诈骗罪和私吞公款罪起诉你了
we have a case of fraud and embezzlement

1906
01:46:44,650 --> 01:46:47,820
如果这还不算糟的话
And, as if that weren't bad enough...

1907
01:46:48,700 --> 01:46:54,330
我还发现我们的拖把专利书 并无相似之处
I also discovered in the paperwork that our mops actually don't bear any similarities

1908
01:46:54,370 --> 01:46:57,500
所以我从没有欠你任何专利费
So I never did owe you any royalties for your patent

1909
01:46:58,580 --> 01:47:00,540
这是另一项欺诈
That's another case of fraud

1910
01:47:01,210 --> 01:47:07,220
我的律师可以拿下你 但我跟他们说：“给我一天时间”
My lawyers really could go after you, but I told them, "Give me a day"

1911
01:47:07,260 --> 01:47:13,220
看你有没有可能补救
To see if maybe you might've made a mistake...

1912
01:47:15,010 --> 01:47:17,970
你犯的错误，给你个机会
that you would correct, given the chance

1913
01:47:33,370 --> 01:47:36,370
我们会把你付的专利费退给你
We'll pay you back all the royalties you paid us

1914
01:47:41,460 --> 01:47:46,090
除了你付的五万，我再付你两万
I'll give you $20,000 on top of paying you back the 50

1915
01:47:58,020 --> 01:47:59,230
好啊
Okay

1916
01:48:00,930 --> 01:48:04,680
除了你付的五万，我再付你五万
I'll give you $50,000 on top of paying you back the 50

1917
01:48:16,740 --> 01:48:18,360
加上利息
Plus interest

1918
01:48:23,830 --> 01:48:25,830
我想要回我的所有模具
I want all of my molds back

1919
01:48:26,500 --> 01:48:28,790
我要你在这份文书上签上
I want you to sign this piece of paper...

1920
01:48:29,840 --> 01:48:33,140
你没有任何权利分成
saying that you have no rights, financially

1921
01:48:34,130 --> 01:48:37,590
我再添上 我说的那五万
I'm just gonna add... I said the 50...

1922
01:48:39,720 --> 01:48:41,640
加上五万
plus the 50...

1923
01:48:43,440 --> 01:48:46,230
再加上利息
plus the interest

1924
01:48:46,270 --> 01:48:50,400
我想让你在那两个数字旁 签上你的姓名缩写
So I just want you to initial next to those two numbers as well

1925
01:48:56,450 --> 01:48:57,950
签在这里
So just sign there

1926
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:08,510
她一直在忍耐
She put up with just about anything

1927
01:49:09,500 --> 01:49:11,960
直到忍无可忍时
Until when she had to bring the hammer down...

1928
01:49:13,510 --> 01:49:15,180
她重拳出击
she brought the hammer down

1929
01:49:17,510 --> 01:49:20,130
她不知道接下来会发生什么
She couldn't know what was to come

1930
01:49:21,010 --> 01:49:25,100
她又申请了一个更赚钱的专利
That she'd go on to make another 100 record-setting patents

1931
01:49:26,020 --> 01:49:29,740
细天鹅绒衣架，让衣柜更整洁
Skinny velvet hangers make neater closets

1932
01:49:29,770 --> 01:49:32,100
这对很多人来说是了不起的发明
That's a big deal to a lot of people

1933
01:49:33,280 --> 01:49:35,700
谁会想到这些？
I mean, who thinks of things like that?

1934
01:49:36,860 --> 01:49:38,150
乔伊想到了
Joy did

1935
01:49:42,490 --> 01:49:47,700
她那天走在街上的时候并不知道 这些会发生
She didn't know any of this would happen as she walked down the street that day

1936
01:49:48,380 --> 01:49:52,510
是的，先生，今晚是圣诞老人走访
Yes, sir, tonight's the night for Ol' Saint Nick to make his yearly visit...

1937
01:49:52,550 --> 01:49:54,680
全世界人民的一年一度旅行之夜
to all the folks all over the world

1938
01:49:54,720 --> 01:49:58,350
每一座房子都其乐融融充满了期待
There's fun and expectation in every house across the land

1939
01:49:58,390 --> 01:50:02,440
说到房子，你说我们要不要瞧瞧这一座？
And speaking of houses, what do you say we take a little look-in on a typical one?

1940
01:50:05,430 --> 01:50:10,980
我得说你现在看到的 只是这座房子前廊的一小部分
Now I'll admit that what you see right now is just a small piece of the front of the house...

1941
01:50:11,020 --> 01:50:14,900
所有成年人和小孩都一样 这是圣诞老人的魔法时刻
but all you grownups and kids alike, this is the time for Santa's magic...

1942
01:50:14,940 --> 01:50:18,150
我想我们能把它变成一座真正的房子
so I think we can make it become a real house

1943
01:50:19,030 --> 01:50:20,610
甚至变成一座满是爱的房子
Even a house with love in it

1944
01:50:20,660 --> 01:50:23,710
圣诞老人先生，能给我们下点雪吗？
Mr Santa Claus, can we have a little snow, please?

1945
01:50:25,830 --> 01:50:27,750
谢谢，很美
Thank you That's fine

1946
01:50:28,040 --> 01:50:32,090
圣诞老人，让我看看这座房子的 真实内景
Now, Santa, let me see what it really looks like inside this house

1947
01:51:01,410 --> 01:51:05,920
她不知道有一天 能搬进一座漂亮的大房子
She couldn't know that one day she would move into a big beautiful home

1948
01:51:08,540 --> 01:51:10,800
她的母亲很高兴
Her mother was happy

1949
01:51:11,580 --> 01:51:15,920
她和她母亲一直保持亲密联系 而她和其他家庭成员的关系
She remained close to her, and with the rest of her family...

1950
01:51:15,960 --> 01:51:18,710
一直都很复杂
which was, as always, complicated

1951
01:51:20,880 --> 01:51:26,180
她会为鲁迪、特鲁迪和佩吉 研发的产品付钱
She would pay for products made by Rudy, Trudy, and Peggy

1952
01:51:26,220 --> 01:51:28,260
即使他们研发失败了
Even when they failed

1953
01:51:28,930 --> 01:51:33,680
即使他们不厚道地起诉 争她公司的所属权
Even when they wrongly sued for ownership of her company

1954
01:51:34,570 --> 01:51:39,280
鲁迪一天天变老 乔伊一直照顾他、爱他
As Rudy got older, Joy continued to take care of him and love him

1955
01:51:45,120 --> 01:51:50,790
正如尼尔沃克预见的那样 乔伊的确创下了一番新事业
As Neil Walker predicted, Joy did become a whole new business

1956
01:51:51,290 --> 01:51:53,380
甚至比QVC都发展得好
And even outgrew Q VC

1957
01:51:53,420 --> 01:51:55,170
–她在和她孩子谈话 –托尼在吗？
- She's talking to her children - Is T ony in there?

1958
01:51:55,460 --> 01:51:56,750
是的，托尼在，一家都在
Yes, T ony's in there The family's in there

1959
01:51:57,000 --> 01:52:03,210
她的前夫和她最好的朋友 一直都是她坚强的后盾
Her ex-husband and her best friend would remain her steadfast advisers

1960
01:52:03,260 --> 01:52:04,600
请耐心等候
Please be patient

1961
01:52:10,310 --> 01:52:12,610
我爱你 你们去收拾房间
I love you You guys go and pack your rooms

1962
01:52:12,640 --> 01:52:14,430
–晚安，妈妈 –我爱你
- Good night, Mom - I love you

1963
01:52:23,450 --> 01:52:24,700
–嗨 –嗨
- Hi - Hi

1964
01:52:24,740 --> 01:52:26,410
–欢迎 –谢谢
- Welcome - Thank you

1965
01:52:29,120 --> 01:52:30,330
你带了什么？
What do you have?

1966
01:52:30,370 --> 01:52:32,160
一个旅行用的衣服清洁器
A traveling clothes cleaner

1967
01:52:32,210 --> 01:52:33,210
让我们瞧瞧
Let's see it

1968
01:52:34,170 --> 01:52:35,460
你来自孟菲斯吗？
So you're from Memphis?

1969
01:52:35,500 --> 01:52:36,830
对，我是
Yes, I am

1970
01:52:36,880 --> 01:52:38,170
你是服务生？
You work as a waitress?

1971
01:52:38,210 --> 01:52:39,500
对，夫人
Yes, ma'am

1972
01:52:39,550 --> 01:52:42,050
好，让我们瞧瞧
All right Let's see it

1973
01:52:43,550 --> 01:52:44,840
你自己做的？
You made this yourself?
