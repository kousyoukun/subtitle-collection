2
00:00:45,671 --> 00:00:46,801
It doesn't make sense.

3
00:00:46,839 --> 00:00:49,469
I don't understand how something
like this happened.

4
00:00:51,385 --> 00:00:53,055
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

5
00:00:53,095 --> 00:00:54,935
This has been my whole life,
and now it's gone.

6
00:00:54,972 --> 00:00:56,852
I don't know what I'm supposed to do.

7
00:00:58,016 --> 00:01:01,136
Pendleton Industries is
all I've ever known.

8
00:01:01,186 --> 00:01:03,516
And now it's all been taken away.

9
00:01:05,399 --> 00:01:09,609
When someone sees a weakness in me,
I turn that weakness into a strength.

10
00:01:15,325 --> 00:01:17,285
Danica, you're so strong.

11
00:01:18,996 --> 00:01:21,786
I don't think I could do
anything like this.

12
00:01:22,666 --> 00:01:24,786
You can imagine changing your life...

13
00:01:24,835 --> 00:01:27,465
by fighting for the deed
to the land, Clarinda.

14
00:01:27,504 --> 00:01:31,424
Which is only possible if Bartholomew
is no longer living.

15
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:37,810
You will never get
the deed to the land again.

16
00:01:37,848 --> 00:01:39,888
I will never allow it.

17
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:42,273
Put down that gun,
you silly girl.

18
00:01:42,978 --> 00:01:45,228
Watch your step, Bartholomew.

19
00:01:45,272 --> 00:01:47,152
Ridge is on his way.

20
00:01:47,191 --> 00:01:49,151
And he's still in love with Clarinda.

21
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:52,203
And Jared loves me.

22
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:53,949
Clarinda...

23
00:01:54,615 --> 00:01:56,075
it's true.

24
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:57,196
I'm here for you.

25
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:17,600
This is the story of Joy,
as told by me, her grandmother.

26
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:26,729
Everybody starts out with some
kind of dream of what life will be.

27
00:02:30,943 --> 00:02:34,363
Joy's dream started at this metal garage
her father ran.

28
00:02:43,247 --> 00:02:46,877
Jackie, Jackie, bo-backie
Banana-fana, fo-fackie.

29
00:02:46,917 --> 00:02:48,837
Fee-fi, mo-mackie
Jackie.

30
00:02:48,877 --> 00:02:52,547
My granddaughter had a best friend,
Jackie.

31
00:02:52,589 --> 00:02:54,669
Joy, Joy, bo-boy
Banana-fana, fo-foy.

32
00:02:54,716 --> 00:02:57,506
While shivering in my shoes

33
00:02:57,553 --> 00:02:59,723
I strike a careless pose.

34
00:02:59,763 --> 00:03:01,563
A half-sister, Peggy.

35
00:03:04,726 --> 00:03:05,726
A dog.

36
00:03:05,769 --> 00:03:07,769
It's okay. It's okay, Mitzy.

37
00:03:08,105 --> 00:03:09,445
A father.

38
00:03:11,859 --> 00:03:13,649
A mother...

39
00:03:15,946 --> 00:03:17,736
who is my daughter.

40
00:03:19,116 --> 00:03:22,076
A grandmother. That's me.

41
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:38,220
She made many beautiful things
in her room.

42
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:39,470
Magic.

43
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:43,182
Some people love to make things.

44
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:49,149
They have the patience and the focus
to figure it out with their hands.

45
00:03:49,188 --> 00:03:53,188
Joy was one of those people
who rejoiced in making things.

46
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:57,243
And I open the gate
to the big green meadow.

47
00:03:57,905 --> 00:04:00,375
And I went into the forest.

48
00:04:01,116 --> 00:04:03,276
And there, I conquered many dangers.

49
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:06,198
A wolf...

50
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:08,536
and other scary things.

51
00:04:08,582 --> 00:04:11,632
And then I started to build
my very own house...

52
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:13,549
where I would live...

53
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:16,877
and make wonderful creations
for all the world...

54
00:04:16,924 --> 00:04:18,724
to see and have.

55
00:04:19,343 --> 00:04:20,893
And maybe for the prince and princess...

56
00:04:20,928 --> 00:04:23,638
who lived across the forest,
in the castle.

57
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,680
See?

58
00:04:25,349 --> 00:04:27,229
And they were in love.

59
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:28,887
And maybe they'd invite me over...

60
00:04:28,936 --> 00:04:30,806
because of the things that I made.

61
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:35,645
You need a handsome prince.
That's what you need. A prince.

62
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:39,654
No, I don't need a prince.

63
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:42,776
This is a special power.
I don't need a prince.

64
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:49,622
My daughter Terry is separated,
and alone in her room...

65
00:04:49,665 --> 00:04:51,505
watching soap operas.

66
00:04:51,542 --> 00:04:52,832
You can imagine changing your life...

67
00:04:52,876 --> 00:04:55,796
by fighting for the deed
to the land, Clarinda.

68
00:04:56,713 --> 00:04:59,053
I have something for you.

69
00:04:59,091 --> 00:05:00,551
Oh, Danica...

70
00:05:01,593 --> 00:05:02,763
You're so strong.

71
00:05:02,803 --> 00:05:05,223
I don't think I could ever do
something like this.

72
00:05:09,476 --> 00:05:12,646
I always felt it was for me
to encourage her.

73
00:05:13,939 --> 00:05:15,269
So I said...

74
00:05:15,816 --> 00:05:20,946
You are going to grow up and be a strong,
smart young woman...

75
00:05:20,988 --> 00:05:26,488
go to school, meet a fine young man,
have beautiful children of your own...

76
00:05:26,535 --> 00:05:32,215
and you're gonna build wonderful things
that you do in your room.

77
00:05:32,249 --> 00:05:33,079
Okay?

78
00:05:33,125 --> 00:05:35,595
What happened to this girl's dreams?

79
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,210
Watch this.

80
00:05:38,255 --> 00:05:40,385
Mother, I can't find my lanyard for work.

81
00:05:40,424 --> 00:05:42,594
They're not gonna let me through
airport security without it.

82
00:05:42,634 --> 00:05:45,354
Joy, you can't find your lanyard?
Can I help you?

83
00:05:45,387 --> 00:05:46,347
No, but I...

84
00:05:46,388 --> 00:05:47,558
Honey, listen.

85
00:05:47,598 --> 00:05:51,938
I know life hasn't gone as we discussed
many times, sweetheart.

86
00:05:51,977 --> 00:05:54,727
And you don't exactly have
your whole life ahead of you...

87
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:57,521
but you still have a good portion
of it, anyway.

88
00:05:58,442 --> 00:06:00,442
Hope springs eternal.

89
00:06:01,653 --> 00:06:03,323
- Thanks, Mimi.
- Sure.

90
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:05,953
Mother, look what I did find.

91
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:08,907
What is that?

92
00:06:08,952 --> 00:06:10,832
How can you ask what this is?

93
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:14,175
The dog collar I invented
in high school.

94
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:16,168
Remember Mitzy choked a couple of times?

95
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:18,710
So I invented a dog collar
with a quick release...

96
00:06:18,754 --> 00:06:19,964
so that a dog would never choke...

97
00:06:20,005 --> 00:06:23,715
and I covered it with reflective tape,
plus it's a flea collar.

98
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:26,589
I probably wouldn't be late to this job
I'm going to...

99
00:06:26,637 --> 00:06:28,347
if you'd gotten me a patent or a lawyer.

100
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:31,388
Joy the doer, Joy the doer.
You were always doing things, honey.

101
00:06:31,433 --> 00:06:33,773
How could I be expected
to remember everything?

102
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:36,650
Now the Hartz company
has the patent to that collar.

103
00:06:36,688 --> 00:06:38,608
I don't know how to get a patent.

104
00:06:39,483 --> 00:06:40,863
What is that smell?

105
00:06:41,985 --> 00:06:43,945
How did you get
yogurt down here, Mother?

106
00:06:45,239 --> 00:06:46,779
I was wondering what that odor was.

107
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:48,953
It's starting to mold for Pete's sake.

108
00:06:48,992 --> 00:06:53,202
Yes, I am, because I feel like I cannot
have the life bled out of me this way.

109
00:06:53,247 --> 00:06:56,207
Joy, look who's back.
Look who's back!

110
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:58,790
Yes, Bartholomew is back.

111
00:06:58,836 --> 00:06:59,666
No, no.

112
00:06:59,711 --> 00:07:00,961
I thought Bartholomew was dead?

113
00:07:01,004 --> 00:07:02,134
And I'm a ghost.

114
00:07:02,172 --> 00:07:04,172
He came back as a ghost with
even greater powers.

115
00:07:04,216 --> 00:07:05,376
Ghost, you go away!

116
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:07,465
My powers are even greater now.

117
00:07:07,511 --> 00:07:09,471
I cannot handle this.
How is this possible?

118
00:07:10,138 --> 00:07:11,178
Stay away from him.

119
00:07:11,223 --> 00:07:13,143
Clarinda, you don't know
what a ghost can do to you!

120
00:07:13,183 --> 00:07:14,643
Even from beyond the grave.

121
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,360
Grandma's gonna take you
to the birthday party, okay?

122
00:07:18,397 --> 00:07:19,397
Five minutes.

123
00:07:20,941 --> 00:07:23,491
Hi. What are you doing here?

124
00:07:23,527 --> 00:07:25,857
I'm returning him to you.
I don't want him anymore.

125
00:07:25,904 --> 00:07:26,954
What?

126
00:07:27,531 --> 00:07:28,821
He's damaged.

127
00:07:28,866 --> 00:07:30,326
He has no place else to go.

128
00:07:30,701 --> 00:07:32,701
He's been living
in my house for two years.

129
00:07:32,744 --> 00:07:34,794
Dad, I'm so sorry.

130
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:37,420
But you know,
Tony's living in the basement.

131
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:39,577
Your ex-husband shouldn't be living
in your basement.

132
00:07:39,626 --> 00:07:41,586
That's not the proper way to be divorced.

133
00:07:41,628 --> 00:07:44,838
Okay. I don't know
where I'm gonna put you.

134
00:07:44,882 --> 00:07:46,592
Dad, don't go in there. Mom's in there.

135
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:50,389
You can have him back, Terry.
I don't want him anymore.

136
00:07:50,429 --> 00:07:52,179
What was so much better about
being with Sharon, Rudy?

137
00:07:52,222 --> 00:07:53,472
Dad, don't answer that.

138
00:07:53,515 --> 00:07:55,555
We went to the Metropolitan Museum of Art.

139
00:07:55,601 --> 00:07:58,191
- What did you like at the museum?
- What did I like? I'll tell you what I like.

140
00:07:58,228 --> 00:08:02,188
I like the ancient Roman statues.
I like the medieval armor.

141
00:08:02,232 --> 00:08:04,032
I like the Etruscan jewelry.

142
00:08:04,067 --> 00:08:06,817
- Museums are full of dust and death.
- I like going to the café...

143
00:08:06,862 --> 00:08:08,992
having an espresso, a nice panini,
that's what I like.

144
00:08:09,031 --> 00:08:11,281
You had a panini in a coffin, Rudy.

145
00:08:11,325 --> 00:08:14,335
- A dusty, boring coffin. Yuck.
- Then why'd you ask me?

146
00:08:14,369 --> 00:08:15,539
What are you, a crazy person?

147
00:08:15,579 --> 00:08:17,329
It's like having a conversation
with an insane asylum person.

148
00:08:17,372 --> 00:08:18,832
What else, Captain Jack?
What else was so great?

149
00:08:18,874 --> 00:08:20,544
Captain Jack, you're calling me. Okay.

150
00:08:20,584 --> 00:08:21,884
Yes, you're Captain Jack,
the flying jackass.

151
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:23,919
Yeah, and you know what you are?
You're like a gas leak.

152
00:08:23,962 --> 00:08:25,762
- We don't smell you, we don't see you...
- I am not a gas leak!

153
00:08:25,797 --> 00:08:27,377
- But you're killing us all silently.
- You take that back...

154
00:08:27,424 --> 00:08:28,554
and tell me what else you did
with Sharon!

155
00:08:28,592 --> 00:08:30,052
You creature from the Black Lagoon.

156
00:08:30,093 --> 00:08:31,683
No! This conversation is over.

157
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,680
- I'm leaving. Good luck.
- Oh, my God. Here it goes.

158
00:08:33,722 --> 00:08:35,682
Watch out, Joy. He's gonna snap!

159
00:08:35,724 --> 00:08:37,934
Please. You want me to snap.
That's your whole routine. You...

160
00:08:37,976 --> 00:08:39,096
Guard the china!

161
00:08:39,144 --> 00:08:41,274
- Hey, Terry, you like this?
- Dad, no!

162
00:08:41,313 --> 00:08:42,863
How's this for snapping?

163
00:08:43,357 --> 00:08:44,607
- No! No.
- How's this?

164
00:08:46,151 --> 00:08:47,401
This is snapping!

165
00:08:47,444 --> 00:08:49,904
- Dad! Stop!
- He's disturbed, Joy!

166
00:08:49,947 --> 00:08:51,407
He's a disturbed man!

167
00:08:51,448 --> 00:08:53,318
- I'm disturbed?
- He's a damaged man!

168
00:08:53,367 --> 00:08:55,157
You're right, I am disturbed.

169
00:08:55,202 --> 00:08:56,622
You're the great disturber!

170
00:08:57,579 --> 00:08:58,709
I'm sorry, honey.

171
00:08:58,747 --> 00:08:59,907
I don't like this.

172
00:08:59,957 --> 00:09:01,667
You're not supposed to see
this kind of thing.

173
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:03,958
I'm very, very sorry.
I apologize sincerely.

174
00:09:04,378 --> 00:09:07,128
It's not gonna happen, okay?
We have other...

175
00:09:07,798 --> 00:09:08,918
I'm gonna clean all this up.

176
00:09:08,966 --> 00:09:10,756
Dad, no. Don't clean it up.

177
00:09:10,801 --> 00:09:12,801
Dad, stop. Just don't, okay?

178
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:16,807
Stop. I'll do it.
I just want to get you out of this room.

179
00:09:18,809 --> 00:09:20,059
Thank you.

180
00:09:20,102 --> 00:09:21,812
Hi, guys.
I'm sorry about all the yelling.

181
00:09:21,854 --> 00:09:24,024
Mimi's gonna take you
to the birthday party, okay?

182
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:25,654
Hi, my sweethearts.

183
00:09:25,691 --> 00:09:27,821
- You broke things again.
- He did break stuff.

184
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:29,610
I did break some things,
but Grandma was wrong.

185
00:09:29,653 --> 00:09:32,033
So I was a little wrong,
but she was really wrong.

186
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:34,242
But Grandpa's gonna come stay with us
for a little while.

187
00:09:34,283 --> 00:09:35,783
Yay!

188
00:09:35,826 --> 00:09:38,696
A sleepover with Grandpa! Yay!

189
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:42,365
Sharon never separated the wash.
The whites were always grey.

190
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:44,786
But you have that magic touch, sweetheart,
so could I give this to you, please?

191
00:09:44,835 --> 00:09:46,845
Yeah, I'll take care of it, yeah.
Just get your bag.

192
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:48,509
What about my ledgers and all that stuff?
My accounting books?

193
00:09:48,547 --> 00:09:49,877
I got them.
I'll get them to you later today.

194
00:09:49,923 --> 00:09:51,513
- I love you, Grandpa.
- Love you.

195
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:54,050
- I did your taxes, I did your W-2s.
- Okay. Very important.

196
00:10:08,984 --> 00:10:10,194
You suck!

197
00:10:10,736 --> 00:10:11,896
What is he doing here?

198
00:10:11,945 --> 00:10:13,145
Sharon brought him back...

199
00:10:13,197 --> 00:10:17,327
so he's gonna stay with us until he finds
a new love or a new place to live.

200
00:10:17,367 --> 00:10:18,617
You know how this goes.

201
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:30,169
Dad, up.

202
00:10:32,716 --> 00:10:34,966
This is not the proper way to be divorced,
the two of you.

203
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:36,610
You're gonna tell me how to be divorced?

204
00:10:36,637 --> 00:10:39,177
I'm a provider, Tom Jones.
I have my own business.

205
00:10:39,223 --> 00:10:40,853
I help Joy with the mortgage.
What do you do?

206
00:10:40,891 --> 00:10:43,141
You sing all night
at Angela Starpoli's club.

207
00:10:43,185 --> 00:10:45,405
You get repeatedly fired
from Campbell's Soup.

208
00:10:45,437 --> 00:10:47,517
Okay, well I'm gonna divide
the basement.

209
00:10:47,564 --> 00:10:49,444
I'm divorced.
I can do whatever I want, Rudy.

210
00:10:49,483 --> 00:10:50,983
This is not the proper way to be divorced.

211
00:10:51,026 --> 00:10:52,776
And I'm about to be late for work.

212
00:10:52,819 --> 00:10:55,489
So please try not to fight
in front of the children, okay?

213
00:10:55,531 --> 00:10:56,741
Especially not physically.

214
00:10:56,782 --> 00:10:59,242
Rudy, you see this?
This microphone here?

215
00:10:59,868 --> 00:11:02,498
You touch it, and I kill you.

216
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:05,961
Okay. I'm leaving.

217
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:08,209
Please try not to kill each other
while I'm gone.

218
00:11:08,252 --> 00:11:10,422
You've gone mad. This is all your fault!

219
00:11:10,462 --> 00:11:12,382
Clarinda. Clarinda! Don't.

220
00:11:12,422 --> 00:11:15,222
Clarinda, something terrible happened!
Stay away from him!

221
00:11:19,054 --> 00:11:21,814
Oh, my God.
I thought I fixed this thing.

222
00:11:21,849 --> 00:11:23,889
Nice job, Joy. Nice job.

223
00:11:23,934 --> 00:11:26,904
Peggy? What are you doing here?

224
00:11:27,771 --> 00:11:30,532
What's the matter with you?
Sending Grandma Mimi with her arthritis...

225
00:11:30,566 --> 00:11:32,316
to take them to their friend's birthday?

226
00:11:32,359 --> 00:11:33,649
I'm fine.

227
00:11:33,694 --> 00:11:36,784
They have a much better time
with me anyway, with Aunt Peggy.

228
00:11:37,739 --> 00:11:41,199
But I wasn't stupid enough to get into
a bad marriage and have a couple of kids.

229
00:11:41,243 --> 00:11:42,543
Don't bother your sister, Peggy.

230
00:11:42,578 --> 00:11:45,158
I'm gonna talk to Dad about business.
All right?

231
00:11:45,205 --> 00:11:46,915
You gonna come bring the books
by the garage later?

232
00:11:46,957 --> 00:11:48,577
Yeah, I'm gonna bring them later.
He's in the basement.

233
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:49,745
I'm joking with you.

234
00:11:49,793 --> 00:11:51,043
Yeah. I know.

235
00:11:51,086 --> 00:11:53,376
Kids, we're gonna do
something fun later, okay?

236
00:11:53,422 --> 00:11:55,092
We're doing something fun now.

237
00:12:01,722 --> 00:12:04,272
Oh, we found your luggage
but it's in Cleveland.

238
00:12:04,308 --> 00:12:06,058
So now we just need to get it back
to New York City.

239
00:12:06,101 --> 00:12:07,231
I'm filing a complaint.

240
00:12:08,478 --> 00:12:10,228
My husband needs his medication.

241
00:12:10,606 --> 00:12:12,356
What's your name? Joy?

242
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:14,279
You don't seem joyous to me today.

243
00:12:14,318 --> 00:12:16,238
Perhaps I am not so joyous today.

244
00:12:16,278 --> 00:12:18,148
- Joy, I think you're getting demoted.
- Hi, how you doing?

245
00:12:18,197 --> 00:12:20,197
Listen, I need you to speak
to the supervisor.

246
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,950
We're gonna be having some changes,
and you're gonna be going to the night hours.

247
00:12:23,994 --> 00:12:25,914
- Night hours? Tom, I can't work night hours.
- And we're having cutbacks.

248
00:12:25,954 --> 00:12:27,584
- I've got two kids.
- Joy, I'm sorry.

249
00:12:27,623 --> 00:12:28,673
Good luck.

250
00:12:28,707 --> 00:12:29,707
Bye, Susan.

251
00:12:50,312 --> 00:12:52,772
I'm not paying for metal
that I haven't gotten.

252
00:12:52,814 --> 00:12:54,824
On top of me send...
You know, he wants to get paid.

253
00:12:54,858 --> 00:12:57,398
He doesn't send an invoice,
and he hasn't even sent the metal.

254
00:12:58,153 --> 00:13:01,113
But why doesn't he just send the invoice?
Send the invoice, I'll pay him.

255
00:13:01,865 --> 00:13:03,615
Yep. That's it. Send the invoice.

256
00:13:05,536 --> 00:13:08,286
Hi. Dad, I want to thank you again
for helping with the mortgage.

257
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:09,290
Yeah.

258
00:13:09,331 --> 00:13:12,461
I settled the accounts, balanced the books.

259
00:13:12,501 --> 00:13:13,211
Thank you.

260
00:13:13,252 --> 00:13:15,002
I'm sorry business is so bad, Dad.

261
00:13:15,045 --> 00:13:17,545
I don't think that
that crazy gun range is helping.

262
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:19,631
How is that still legal?

263
00:13:19,675 --> 00:13:21,555
- What can I do?
- After all these years?

264
00:13:21,593 --> 00:13:23,353
They keep to themselves.

265
00:13:23,387 --> 00:13:25,427
It's their property.
The police leave them alone.

266
00:13:25,472 --> 00:13:27,312
Why? You think it's costing us business?

267
00:13:27,349 --> 00:13:28,679
I don't think it's helping.

268
00:13:29,685 --> 00:13:32,195
Well, if you wanna help, why don't you
come here and manage this place?

269
00:13:32,229 --> 00:13:35,019
You know, I'd like to go the next level.
Put on a nice suit.

270
00:13:35,065 --> 00:13:37,025
You know, go out there
and get some accounts.

271
00:13:38,652 --> 00:13:43,112
Yeah, this is 9873.
Just checking my mailbox.

272
00:13:43,156 --> 00:13:44,316
What is that?

273
00:13:44,366 --> 00:13:45,606
Yeah, I have a pen. What is it?

274
00:13:45,742 --> 00:13:48,162
13-14. That's it?

275
00:13:48,412 --> 00:13:49,702
Thank you.

276
00:13:49,746 --> 00:13:51,246
What was that?

277
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:53,540
It's a 900 number.

278
00:13:53,584 --> 00:13:54,834
What's a 900 number?

279
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:59,210
It's, you know, a dating service
for widows and widowers.

280
00:13:59,256 --> 00:14:00,546
Dating service?

281
00:14:00,591 --> 00:14:01,971
You're not a widow or a widower.

282
00:14:02,009 --> 00:14:03,389
What's the difference? I'm single.

283
00:14:03,427 --> 00:14:06,387
I meet nice ladies.
Maybe we fall in love.

284
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:09,020
I have to fall in love or I'm not interested.
You know me.

285
00:14:09,057 --> 00:14:10,057
I know, Dad.

286
00:14:11,101 --> 00:14:14,021
Sharon was no good for him.
It's nice for him to meet somebody new.

287
00:14:14,062 --> 00:14:16,192
- I got him some new clothes, you know?
- Okay. Okay.

288
00:14:16,231 --> 00:14:17,821
- Hello? Is this 7633?
- It's good., THEN JOY TO PEGGY.

289
00:14:17,858 --> 00:14:19,978
- Okay. I love you. See you later.
- Yes?

290
00:14:20,027 --> 00:14:20,897
Bye.

291
00:14:20,944 --> 00:14:22,704
Hi. This is 9833.

292
00:14:23,614 --> 00:14:25,414
Hi! Hi, how are you?

293
00:14:25,449 --> 00:14:26,869
What a nice voice you have.

294
00:14:27,409 --> 00:14:28,409
Thank you.

295
00:14:28,577 --> 00:14:30,747
- Oh, an accent.
- Yes.

296
00:14:30,787 --> 00:14:32,157
I am from Italy.

297
00:14:32,206 --> 00:14:33,786
Oh! Continental.

298
00:14:34,499 --> 00:14:35,749
What is your name?

299
00:14:35,792 --> 00:14:37,592
My name is Rudy, what's yours?

300
00:14:37,628 --> 00:14:38,628
Trudy.

301
00:14:38,962 --> 00:14:40,842
- Are you kidding me?
- No.

302
00:14:40,881 --> 00:14:42,091
Your name is Trudy?

303
00:14:42,132 --> 00:14:43,092
Yes!

304
00:14:43,133 --> 00:14:44,473
Rudy and Trudy. I love it.

305
00:14:44,885 --> 00:14:47,475
Let's figure out when we're gonna meet.

306
00:14:47,513 --> 00:14:49,563
That's a good idea. Let's have dinner.

307
00:14:49,973 --> 00:14:51,313
- I could come pick you up.
- Yeah.

308
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:52,850
I have a green Mercedes.

309
00:14:52,893 --> 00:14:55,023
Okay, 6:30? I'll be ready.

310
00:14:55,062 --> 00:14:56,062
Ciao.

311
00:14:57,272 --> 00:14:58,772
Good luck with your date, Dad.

312
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:00,185
Thank you. I'm excited.

313
00:15:00,234 --> 00:15:01,744
What do you think you're gonna wear?

314
00:15:03,195 --> 00:15:05,455
Polo by Ralph Lauren.

315
00:15:05,489 --> 00:15:07,489
Did you have to use
the whole bottle of cologne?

316
00:15:07,533 --> 00:15:08,203
Tony!

317
00:15:08,242 --> 00:15:10,162
You smell like my grandmother.
He smells like my grandmother.

318
00:15:10,202 --> 00:15:12,002
Hey, please. Don't make me tense.

319
00:15:12,037 --> 00:15:15,207
Don't stress me out.
I gotta stay nice and loose.

320
00:15:15,249 --> 00:15:16,959
- Now you're tense?
- I'm tense. You're making me tense.

321
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,250
- Guys, stop. Please.
- I'm making you tense?

322
00:15:19,795 --> 00:15:21,005
My carriage awaits.

323
00:15:21,046 --> 00:15:22,456
Have a great date.

324
00:15:22,506 --> 00:15:23,626
Wish me luck.

325
00:15:23,674 --> 00:15:24,764
You don't need it.

326
00:15:25,467 --> 00:15:27,427
Joy, water!

327
00:15:27,469 --> 00:15:28,599
Where are my cufflinks?

328
00:15:28,637 --> 00:15:30,467
Mommy, come read to me!

329
00:15:30,514 --> 00:15:31,644
Five minutes, Cristy.

330
00:15:31,682 --> 00:15:32,892
Mother, again?

331
00:15:34,142 --> 00:15:36,482
Yeah, you just sit right there.
Are you comfortable?

332
00:15:36,854 --> 00:15:42,284
How many times do I have to tell you
not to clean your brushes out in the sink!

333
00:15:42,317 --> 00:15:44,817
Danica thinks it's unladylike
to toss things in the toilet.

334
00:15:44,862 --> 00:15:46,152
And I happen to agree.

335
00:15:46,196 --> 00:15:48,616
Yeah? Well, why don't you have
Danica do your plumbing then?

336
00:15:48,657 --> 00:15:52,367
Danica can direct her power
anywhere Danica chooses.

337
00:15:52,411 --> 00:15:54,831
That is the power of Danica.

338
00:15:57,499 --> 00:15:58,829
Oh, my God.

339
00:15:58,876 --> 00:16:01,166
If this problem gets any worse...

340
00:16:02,212 --> 00:16:04,552
we're gonna have to move you
into a different room.

341
00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:06,050
That means no TV.

342
00:16:06,717 --> 00:16:08,427
That could be very scary for you.

343
00:16:09,428 --> 00:16:12,308
Don't let that happen, Joy.
This is my comfort nest.

344
00:16:13,348 --> 00:16:15,428
We're gonna need to get
a plumber in here.

345
00:16:15,475 --> 00:16:16,555
What?

346
00:16:17,311 --> 00:16:20,151
There's gonna... A man in my room?

347
00:16:20,189 --> 00:16:22,519
Well, I don't know any female plumbers
other than me.

348
00:16:22,566 --> 00:16:24,106
Well, can't you fix it, Joy?

349
00:16:24,151 --> 00:16:26,701
This has surpassed my capabilities.

350
00:16:26,737 --> 00:16:27,857
Thanks, Joy.

351
00:16:28,739 --> 00:16:31,829
"The cicada is a large flying insect
two to three inches long."

352
00:16:31,867 --> 00:16:35,407
"It makes a sound of up to 120 decibels,
louder than some telephones."

353
00:16:36,246 --> 00:16:39,956
"It lives half of its life above ground
evading predators."

354
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,710
This is the book you wanted me
to read to you, Cristy?

355
00:16:41,752 --> 00:16:43,352
How did this book even get in the house?

356
00:16:43,754 --> 00:16:45,384
Aunt Peggy got it for me.

357
00:16:45,422 --> 00:16:49,932
She said the reason I like cicadas
is because they fill the air with sound...

358
00:16:49,968 --> 00:16:52,098
which makes the house less lonelier for me.

359
00:16:52,763 --> 00:16:56,223
Aunt Peggy tells you how you feel
about the house being lonely?

360
00:16:56,266 --> 00:16:57,886
Aunt Peggy tells me a lot of things.

361
00:16:57,935 --> 00:16:59,315
Keep reading, please.

362
00:17:00,812 --> 00:17:03,402
I don't want you
listening to Aunt Peggy too much.

363
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,820
Okay. Why?

364
00:17:06,068 --> 00:17:08,608
"The cicada,
a symbol of rebirth in many countries..."

365
00:17:08,654 --> 00:17:12,324
"digs into the ground and stays buried
for up to 17 years."

366
00:17:12,950 --> 00:17:16,040
That's such a random number.
Why 17 years?

367
00:17:16,828 --> 00:17:18,078
It doesn't even say why.

368
00:17:18,121 --> 00:17:21,251
I understand the four seasons in a year...

369
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:23,841
but why would something
stay hidden for 17 years?

370
00:17:23,877 --> 00:17:26,757
That's just unsettling.
I'm not reading this.

371
00:17:26,797 --> 00:17:28,797
You're sleepy anyway.
We gotta go to bed.

372
00:17:30,092 --> 00:17:31,932
I wanna sleep with Nana.

373
00:17:31,969 --> 00:17:33,599
No, you should sleep upstairs
in your room.

374
00:17:33,637 --> 00:17:35,177
I want Nana.

375
00:17:37,057 --> 00:17:38,937
All right. Well, watch out.
There's a hole here.

376
00:17:45,274 --> 00:17:47,114
Just going to lay down for a second.

377
00:17:49,111 --> 00:17:51,451
I feel like I'm in a prison.

378
00:17:51,488 --> 00:17:54,158
No, Bartholomew's the ex-con
in the story.

379
00:17:54,199 --> 00:17:56,329
And Clarinda doesn't even know about it.

380
00:17:56,368 --> 00:17:57,988
But Danica's onto him.

381
00:17:59,162 --> 00:18:01,962
They all blame Clarinda
but Danica's gonna get to the bottom of it.

382
00:18:01,999 --> 00:18:03,209
No. No.

383
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:05,790
Yes. It was you Clarinda.

384
00:18:05,836 --> 00:18:07,246
I will get to the bottom of this.

385
00:18:07,296 --> 00:18:09,006
You've made terrible mistakes.

386
00:18:09,047 --> 00:18:10,417
It was Clarinda!

387
00:18:13,177 --> 00:18:14,337
Oh.

388
00:18:14,386 --> 00:18:15,466
Look who's here.

389
00:18:15,512 --> 00:18:16,682
Look who's here.

390
00:18:17,014 --> 00:18:18,064
Look who's here.

391
00:18:39,244 --> 00:18:42,504
We are here today
to remember what was lost...

392
00:18:42,539 --> 00:18:44,959
seventeen years ago.

393
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,040
Do you remember?

394
00:18:49,379 --> 00:18:50,759
Peggy comes with me.

395
00:18:50,797 --> 00:18:52,837
Joy spends half the time with us.

396
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:55,180
We'll take her paper forest.

397
00:18:55,219 --> 00:18:57,509
That's Joy's special thing,
and it belongs in this house.

398
00:18:57,554 --> 00:18:58,644
No, I...

399
00:19:10,943 --> 00:19:11,943
Joy.

400
00:19:13,862 --> 00:19:14,952
Joy, wake up!

401
00:19:15,614 --> 00:19:17,414
Someone's been ringing the doorbell.

402
00:19:31,421 --> 00:19:32,631
Jackie!

403
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:34,260
Oh, thank God! It's you.

404
00:19:34,299 --> 00:19:37,799
What happened? I'm worried about you.
I don't see you any more.

405
00:19:37,845 --> 00:19:39,605
You don't come to the PTA.

406
00:19:40,013 --> 00:19:44,143
You know how my mom's always clogging
the sink with her hair from the brushes?

407
00:19:44,184 --> 00:19:45,564
With the pipes in her room?

408
00:19:45,602 --> 00:19:47,562
Yeah. She did it again.

409
00:19:47,604 --> 00:19:48,404
Again?

410
00:19:48,438 --> 00:19:50,818
Yes, and I had to
bash open a hole in the floor.

411
00:19:50,858 --> 00:19:54,738
There's a huge hole in the floor
of my mother's room and I'm broke.

412
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:59,990
My father works hard.
He's had some bad breaks.

413
00:20:02,494 --> 00:20:05,874
I hope he gets another girlfriend,
and he'll move out of the basement.

414
00:20:06,290 --> 00:20:07,830
He's in the basement with Tony?

415
00:20:07,875 --> 00:20:10,545
Yes. And they hate each other.

416
00:20:11,170 --> 00:20:12,500
Yes.

417
00:20:13,297 --> 00:20:15,837
It's a disaster.
They won't stop fighting.

418
00:20:17,551 --> 00:20:18,551
I don't know.

419
00:20:19,511 --> 00:20:22,641
But how are you?
How's the family? How is everybody?

420
00:20:22,681 --> 00:20:23,771
Everybody's okay.

421
00:20:23,807 --> 00:20:25,017
How's work?

422
00:20:25,642 --> 00:20:27,982
My job, I could take it or leave it.

423
00:20:28,812 --> 00:20:31,112
What happened to us, Jackie?

424
00:20:31,148 --> 00:20:33,778
All the things
that we used to dream about.

425
00:20:33,817 --> 00:20:36,947
I feel like they just keep getting
farther and farther away.

426
00:20:36,987 --> 00:20:39,907
Remember the night of the party
where everything started?

427
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,830
The band was playing.

428
00:20:42,284 --> 00:20:43,914
Everything was so exciting.

429
00:20:45,829 --> 00:20:47,499
Joy, you came!

430
00:20:47,539 --> 00:20:50,249
I'm so glad you came!
This is my boyfriend, Andre.

431
00:20:50,292 --> 00:20:51,632
- Hi, Andre.
- Nice to meet you.

432
00:20:51,668 --> 00:20:53,378
Andre, this is my childhood friend, Joy.

433
00:20:53,879 --> 00:20:55,009
Come inside!

434
00:20:56,089 --> 00:20:57,629
- Wow.
- Check my music class, accountant girl.

435
00:20:57,674 --> 00:20:58,934
This is a class?

436
00:20:58,967 --> 00:20:59,967
Yes!

437
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:02,890
Don't turn on the lights
'cause I don't wanna see.

438
00:21:02,930 --> 00:21:05,350
Mama told me not to come.

439
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:07,520
- They're so good!
- They are! The teacher's band.

440
00:21:07,559 --> 00:21:08,979
Mama told me not to come.

441
00:21:09,019 --> 00:21:10,479
Mama told me not to come.

442
00:21:10,521 --> 00:21:15,151
She said,
"That ain't the way to have fun, son".

443
00:21:15,192 --> 00:21:16,942
"That ain't the way to have fun."

444
00:21:18,028 --> 00:21:20,358
Mama told me not to come.

445
00:21:21,823 --> 00:21:24,243
Mama told me not to come.

446
00:21:24,952 --> 00:21:27,412
- Who's the bald guy?
- That's our music teacher.

447
00:21:27,454 --> 00:21:29,624
And he has all this...
This is his house?

448
00:21:29,665 --> 00:21:31,125
- Yeah, this is his house.
- Wow.

449
00:21:31,166 --> 00:21:32,536
He's from Venezuela.

450
00:21:32,584 --> 00:21:35,304
- Who is that guy?
- Yeah.

451
00:21:35,337 --> 00:21:37,377
That's the music teacher's son.

452
00:21:38,048 --> 00:21:39,588
Oh, my gosh.

453
00:21:41,718 --> 00:21:43,218
You're dancing. Here you go.

454
00:21:49,268 --> 00:21:50,388
What am I doing now?

455
00:21:50,435 --> 00:21:51,685
- You're dancing.
- No.

456
00:21:51,728 --> 00:21:53,228
- Let me show you my father's house.
- What?

457
00:21:53,272 --> 00:21:54,522
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

458
00:21:54,565 --> 00:21:56,115
I'm gonna be a singer.

459
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,440
Really?

460
00:21:57,484 --> 00:22:00,204
Yeah. I'm gonna be
the next Tom Jones.

461
00:22:00,237 --> 00:22:03,527
That's a big ambition.
There's only one Tom Jones.

462
00:22:03,574 --> 00:22:07,084
I know, but you can't let the practical
get you down.

463
00:22:07,911 --> 00:22:10,161
You gotta keep going to what you love.

464
00:22:10,914 --> 00:22:12,214
That's true.

465
00:22:12,249 --> 00:22:13,879
That's what my father taught me.

466
00:22:17,212 --> 00:22:18,592
What about you?

467
00:22:20,549 --> 00:22:26,849
I invented a dog collar that I want to get patented,
but I don't think it ever will.

468
00:22:28,515 --> 00:22:31,635
I was valedictorian in high school.

469
00:22:33,312 --> 00:22:36,362
I got into a college in Boston...

470
00:22:36,398 --> 00:22:39,568
but I'm staying here
because my parents are getting divorced...

471
00:22:39,610 --> 00:22:41,900
and I'm staying to help my mom.

472
00:22:41,945 --> 00:22:45,735
And I help my dad with business stuff.
Accountant.

473
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:49,580
Maybe your dreams are on hold right now.

474
00:22:49,953 --> 00:22:51,043
No?

475
00:22:51,705 --> 00:22:53,785
That's a nice way of putting it.

476
00:22:54,917 --> 00:22:56,917
This song is going to be
in the town musical.

477
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,630
We should sing it together.

478
00:22:58,879 --> 00:23:02,549
I know I stand in line
Until you think you have the time.

479
00:23:02,591 --> 00:23:05,511
To spend an evening with me.

480
00:23:06,637 --> 00:23:07,927
That's really nice.

481
00:23:07,971 --> 00:23:09,221
Okay, go.

482
00:23:09,264 --> 00:23:10,604
- No.
- Okay.

483
00:23:10,641 --> 00:23:12,931
And if we go someplace to dance

484
00:23:12,976 --> 00:23:15,976
I know that there's a chance
You won't be leaving with me.

485
00:23:16,021 --> 00:23:18,771
He gave my girl a spring in her step,
just when she needed it.

486
00:23:18,815 --> 00:23:20,975
What are we doing? Tony.

487
00:23:21,318 --> 00:23:24,648
He got her to do the musical,
something she never would have done.

488
00:23:35,457 --> 00:23:39,417
I know I stand in line
Until you think you have the time.

489
00:23:39,461 --> 00:23:42,761
To spend an evening with me.

490
00:23:44,842 --> 00:23:48,762
And if we go someplace to dance
I know that there's a chance.

491
00:23:48,804 --> 00:23:52,144
You won't be leaving with me

492
00:23:54,017 --> 00:24:01,017
and afterwards we drop into a
quiet little place and have a drink or two.

493
00:24:03,277 --> 00:24:10,277
And then I go and spoil it all by
saying something stupid like "I love you".

494
00:24:12,202 --> 00:24:16,412
I can see it in your eyes
That you despise the same old lies.

495
00:24:16,456 --> 00:24:19,706
You heard the night before.

496
00:24:20,794 --> 00:24:24,134
You're so smart, you're so beautiful,
I... I just...

497
00:24:25,382 --> 00:24:26,552
You could have married anybody.

498
00:24:26,592 --> 00:24:29,052
You could have married a doctor, a lawyer,
a nice man instead of this...

499
00:24:29,094 --> 00:24:30,604
I don't even know what to call this guy.

500
00:24:30,637 --> 00:24:32,477
Are you seriously talking
about this right now?

501
00:24:36,727 --> 00:24:38,557
It's still not too late.

502
00:24:38,604 --> 00:24:39,604
Dad.

503
00:24:40,355 --> 00:24:41,725
Let's go.

504
00:24:44,193 --> 00:24:45,323
Think about it.

505
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:46,360
Dad!

506
00:25:06,006 --> 00:25:09,046
We are a loving family, a solid family.

507
00:25:09,092 --> 00:25:10,512
I've been married to my wife...

508
00:25:10,552 --> 00:25:11,852
Now I have a speech.

509
00:25:11,887 --> 00:25:13,427
He wasn't finished, Dad.

510
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:14,932
He's finished now.

511
00:25:15,307 --> 00:25:17,227
I had two failed marriages.

512
00:25:17,893 --> 00:25:20,733
The daughter from my first marriage,
Peggy...

513
00:25:20,771 --> 00:25:23,941
has a lot of tension with the daughter
from my second marriage, Joy.

514
00:25:25,317 --> 00:25:30,657
I was married to Joy's mother
for 18 miserable fucking years.

515
00:25:30,989 --> 00:25:32,989
Dad! That's just mean! Sit down!

516
00:25:33,033 --> 00:25:34,373
But I got out of all that.

517
00:25:34,743 --> 00:25:37,623
And I finally met the light of my life,
Sharon.

518
00:25:38,205 --> 00:25:39,415
- To you, baby.
- Dad!

519
00:25:39,456 --> 00:25:40,666
You're my guy.

520
00:25:40,707 --> 00:25:41,707
I toast you.

521
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:43,250
Dad! Stop!

522
00:25:43,293 --> 00:25:45,253
- Will you stop it?
- Rudolph, please! Enough.

523
00:25:45,295 --> 00:25:48,125
- Are you happy now?
- Fairly happy, yes.

524
00:25:48,382 --> 00:25:49,882
Look what I found.

525
00:25:51,093 --> 00:25:52,183
The divorce glass.

526
00:25:52,761 --> 00:25:53,891
Salud.

527
00:25:53,929 --> 00:25:56,259
I give these kids 50-50 odds.

528
00:25:57,015 --> 00:25:59,765
Salud, everybody. Have a good time.

529
00:26:00,102 --> 00:26:01,982
Tony, wake up!

530
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:05,360
Please! Cristy hasn't eaten,
Tommy needs to be changed.

531
00:26:06,066 --> 00:26:09,066
Oh, Cristy. What are you doing?

532
00:26:09,361 --> 00:26:11,741
- Get up. I just told your boss you're going to work!
- But what did you lie for?

533
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:13,950
- Because you're gonna lose another job!
- No, honey, I'm sick!

534
00:26:13,991 --> 00:26:15,871
You're not sick, you're hungover!

535
00:26:16,118 --> 00:26:18,498
That's not who I am!
I'm a singer, that's what I do!

536
00:26:18,537 --> 00:26:20,077
You're not making any money singing!

537
00:26:20,122 --> 00:26:22,002
Get in your car right now
and go get your job!

538
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:24,000
You're trying to turn me
into someone I'm not!

539
00:26:24,042 --> 00:26:26,502
I can't do this!
I can't do this, Tony!

540
00:26:26,545 --> 00:26:28,055
I am losing my mind!

541
00:26:34,344 --> 00:26:36,304
I don't wanna end up like my family.

542
00:26:59,369 --> 00:27:00,749
Time moves forward.

543
00:27:01,371 --> 00:27:03,251
Time moves backwards.

544
00:27:03,290 --> 00:27:04,290
Time stands still.

545
00:27:17,596 --> 00:27:19,636
Do I live up to my profile
or do I fall short?

546
00:27:19,681 --> 00:27:22,891
Are you kidding?
You're a banana flambé with extra rum.

547
00:27:23,894 --> 00:27:26,154
You're a trip to the moon
on gossamer wings.

548
00:27:26,188 --> 00:27:29,478
Wow! You're so poetic and romantic.

549
00:27:29,525 --> 00:27:30,485
It's true!

550
00:27:30,526 --> 00:27:32,356
Just like my late Morris.

551
00:27:32,402 --> 00:27:36,572
Morris. Now, he was American and you're Italian,
and your name originated how?

552
00:27:36,615 --> 00:27:38,955
My name. My Italian name is Geltrude.

553
00:27:38,992 --> 00:27:39,832
Geltrude.

554
00:27:39,868 --> 00:27:43,498
And then he called me "Trude,"
and then became more American. "Trudy."

555
00:27:43,997 --> 00:27:44,827
Trudy.

556
00:27:44,873 --> 00:27:49,383
Why don't you come with your entire family,
on my late Morris' boat?

557
00:27:50,254 --> 00:27:52,214
Bring the children,
bring the grandchildren.

558
00:27:52,256 --> 00:27:53,716
Like a motorboat?

559
00:27:53,757 --> 00:27:55,547
No, no, it's a sailboat. 55 feet.

560
00:27:55,592 --> 00:27:57,722
- Wow. That's big. That is big.
- Yeah. Yeah.

561
00:27:57,761 --> 00:27:59,051
Yeah, I would love to.

562
00:27:59,096 --> 00:28:01,176
We'd bring some nice food,
something to drink, that would be great.

563
00:28:01,223 --> 00:28:06,233
Yeah, but not red wine,
because it might stain the teakwood deck.

564
00:28:06,270 --> 00:28:07,520
It's very precious.

565
00:28:07,563 --> 00:28:09,273
Okay, understood. No red wine.

566
00:28:09,523 --> 00:28:11,403
I got the red wine!

567
00:28:11,441 --> 00:28:13,571
No, no, no, I'm sorry,
you can't have red wine on the boat.

568
00:28:13,610 --> 00:28:15,740
No red wine, Tony. No red wine.

569
00:28:15,779 --> 00:28:17,489
Why? It's a beautiful wine!

570
00:28:17,531 --> 00:28:19,821
What's Tom Jones doing here anyway?
Who invited him?

571
00:28:19,867 --> 00:28:21,277
He's here to help me with the kids.

572
00:28:21,702 --> 00:28:23,292
I brought Peggy to help.

573
00:28:23,328 --> 00:28:25,038
Peggy says mean things
about me to my children, so...

574
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:26,540
I say nice things about you, too.

575
00:28:26,582 --> 00:28:27,712
It's a beautiful wine.

576
00:28:27,749 --> 00:28:28,829
You have an accent, too!

577
00:28:28,876 --> 00:28:29,826
Yes.

578
00:28:29,877 --> 00:28:31,287
Where are you from, paesano?

579
00:28:31,336 --> 00:28:33,706
Paesano? Don't encourage him, please.

580
00:28:33,755 --> 00:28:35,005
I'm from Venezuela, darling.

581
00:28:35,048 --> 00:28:36,088
Do you know this song?

582
00:28:50,814 --> 00:28:53,114
I can see why she still loves him!

583
00:28:53,150 --> 00:28:54,570
Come on. Come on board.

584
00:28:54,610 --> 00:28:57,400
- This is gonna be a disaster.
- Dad.

585
00:28:58,530 --> 00:28:59,530
Cheers!

586
00:29:00,282 --> 00:29:03,332
I dressed for boating but I didn't realize
how cold it was gonna be.

587
00:29:03,368 --> 00:29:08,578
My late husband Morris, I met him in Milano
for a trade show for his swimwear line.

588
00:29:08,624 --> 00:29:11,544
He used to say, "Sailing in the winter..."

589
00:29:11,585 --> 00:29:15,095
"is the best comparison
to life in the world of commerce."

590
00:29:31,146 --> 00:29:32,146
Oh, no!

591
00:29:32,606 --> 00:29:35,316
Morris' teakwood deck!

592
00:29:35,359 --> 00:29:37,029
Yeah. Grand adventure. Great.

593
00:29:37,069 --> 00:29:38,699
Nice work, Tom Jones.

594
00:29:39,446 --> 00:29:44,616
Trudy, I know that it's upsetting,
but wouldn't Morris say, "What a grand adventure?"

595
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:47,870
Yeah, you're right. No big deal.
He's probably laughing up in heaven.

596
00:29:47,913 --> 00:29:49,583
We should have used paper cups.

597
00:29:50,123 --> 00:29:51,333
No, but it's not the same thing.

598
00:29:51,375 --> 00:29:53,675
You need a nice glass
for a beautiful wine, you know?

599
00:29:59,383 --> 00:30:00,383
Oh, boy.

600
00:30:00,801 --> 00:30:03,601
Look. It's a piece of glass
right in her hand.

601
00:30:07,015 --> 00:30:09,055
Are you all right, honey?

602
00:30:09,101 --> 00:30:11,311
Yeah, she's thinking of something, Tony.

603
00:30:11,353 --> 00:30:14,863
One loop. One continuous thing.

604
00:30:14,898 --> 00:30:17,978
She's talking to herself. It's strange.

605
00:30:18,026 --> 00:30:19,396
Honey, you should go to bed.

606
00:30:20,195 --> 00:30:24,115
If it was all one continuous loop. Yeah.

607
00:30:26,076 --> 00:30:27,576
Hi, I'm Touissant.

608
00:30:27,619 --> 00:30:29,499
Touissant? Who's this guy?

609
00:30:30,455 --> 00:30:31,575
It's not for me. Is it for you?

610
00:30:31,623 --> 00:30:32,753
No, it's not for me, man.

611
00:30:32,791 --> 00:30:34,041
The plumber.

612
00:30:34,084 --> 00:30:35,344
What's he here for?

613
00:30:35,377 --> 00:30:37,047
What do you think? Terry.

614
00:30:37,588 --> 00:30:38,838
Terry. Oh, Terry.

615
00:30:39,173 --> 00:30:42,383
Oh, no, wait. What's going on?
What is this man doing in my room?

616
00:30:42,718 --> 00:30:43,718
This is...

617
00:30:44,052 --> 00:30:45,722
- Touissant.
- Touissant.

618
00:30:46,597 --> 00:30:48,007
Terry, Touissant.

619
00:30:48,307 --> 00:30:51,307
Well, I mean, I've taped my show...

620
00:30:51,351 --> 00:30:54,521
and then, well,
exactly how long is this going to take?

621
00:30:55,230 --> 00:30:57,570
Well, it shouldn't take more than a day.

622
00:30:57,608 --> 00:31:00,108
What accent is that, Joy?

623
00:31:00,152 --> 00:31:01,702
What country is that from?

624
00:31:01,737 --> 00:31:03,407
- Haiti.
- Haiti.

625
00:31:03,447 --> 00:31:04,607
Haiti?

626
00:31:04,656 --> 00:31:06,116
It's French and Creole.

627
00:31:07,117 --> 00:31:08,657
French and Creole.

628
00:31:08,702 --> 00:31:11,502
Well, is there any way...
Could you please put a curtain up here...

629
00:31:11,538 --> 00:31:14,708
so that I can come and go in my room
and watch my show while he's still working?

630
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:16,460
Of course. I have a stapler.

631
00:31:16,919 --> 00:31:18,039
Thank you, sir.

632
00:31:18,086 --> 00:31:19,746
You're welcome, mademoiselle.

633
00:31:19,796 --> 00:31:20,916
Mademoiselle?

634
00:31:23,467 --> 00:31:26,337
Good luck in here
and good luck with the... that.

635
00:31:27,262 --> 00:31:28,642
Why don't you go to bed?

636
00:31:30,015 --> 00:31:31,975
Keep going up the stairs.
Go to bed.

637
00:31:32,351 --> 00:31:35,271
I don't want to go to sleep.
I don't want to have that horrible dream.

638
00:31:35,312 --> 00:31:38,692
Come on! You can't have the same dream twice.
It never happens.

639
00:31:38,732 --> 00:31:41,072
- It's impossible.
- That's not true.

640
00:31:41,109 --> 00:31:43,529
I had the Peggy dream so many times
when I was younger...

641
00:31:43,570 --> 00:31:44,950
with the masks and the robe.

642
00:31:44,988 --> 00:31:46,528
It doesn't make sense. No, no.

643
00:31:46,573 --> 00:31:49,083
You can't have the same dream twice.
Maybe it's the...

644
00:31:49,117 --> 00:31:50,487
Rudy, she's thinking about something.

645
00:31:50,536 --> 00:31:53,156
Maybe it's a good dream,
and she's working something out.

646
00:31:53,205 --> 00:31:56,715
I don't wanna work anything out.
I just want a nice, dumb sleep.

647
00:31:56,750 --> 00:31:59,340
Let's knock her out.
Give her a children's cough medicine.

648
00:31:59,378 --> 00:32:00,798
- That's what does it.
- Is that safe?

649
00:32:00,838 --> 00:32:02,168
No. It's not safe.

650
00:32:02,214 --> 00:32:03,304
It's expired.

651
00:32:04,216 --> 00:32:06,966
Go on, there. Knock it back, honey.

652
00:32:07,010 --> 00:32:09,100
- No.
- Okay, one more. Knock it down. Come on.

653
00:32:09,137 --> 00:32:10,887
- Rudy!
- Do it, Tony.

654
00:32:10,931 --> 00:32:12,601
- I don't know.
- Just do it. One more.

655
00:32:12,641 --> 00:32:13,641
Okay, one more.

656
00:32:13,684 --> 00:32:16,194
Enough with this! That's it.
I'm gonna make her a hot toddy.

657
00:32:16,228 --> 00:32:17,478
That's what she needs.

658
00:32:17,521 --> 00:32:18,691
You're gonna intoxicate her.

659
00:32:18,730 --> 00:32:21,570
It's all natural, it's all herbal.
Nothing strong.

660
00:32:21,608 --> 00:32:27,858
I was kidnapped by another monk,
who was from Switzerland.

661
00:32:29,533 --> 00:32:36,373
And it turned out that this monk
was a duke of a royal family.

662
00:32:37,541 --> 00:32:40,791
I shouldn't say "was,"
because he still is.

663
00:32:41,170 --> 00:32:42,670
Leave me alone.

664
00:32:43,672 --> 00:32:45,712
I don't think we should let her
sleep on the stairs.

665
00:32:46,133 --> 00:32:48,553
Let's just put it here in the couch, okay?

666
00:33:01,648 --> 00:33:03,818
Seventeen years.

667
00:33:03,859 --> 00:33:06,609
Think about it. We've been hiding...

668
00:33:06,653 --> 00:33:09,413
for seventeen years.

669
00:33:10,574 --> 00:33:12,664
Seventeen years.

670
00:33:13,118 --> 00:33:16,578
We used to make things.
Seventeen years ago.

671
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:19,419
Then, that all stopped.
What happened?

672
00:33:21,251 --> 00:33:24,341
When you're hiding, you're safe...

673
00:33:24,755 --> 00:33:27,475
because people can't see you.

674
00:33:27,841 --> 00:33:30,761
But, funny thing about hiding...

675
00:33:31,178 --> 00:33:33,558
you're even hidden from yourself.

676
00:33:46,944 --> 00:33:48,614
Baby, what's the matter?

677
00:33:49,821 --> 00:33:51,951
Tony, you need to move out
of the basement.

678
00:33:51,990 --> 00:33:53,700
You need to get your own house.

679
00:33:53,742 --> 00:33:55,202
What? Why?

680
00:33:55,786 --> 00:33:58,406
Because I go out at night
and sing at Angela's club?

681
00:33:58,455 --> 00:33:59,705
- Is that it?
- No.

682
00:33:59,748 --> 00:34:02,168
Because we've been divorced
for two years.

683
00:34:02,209 --> 00:34:03,839
We need to move on.

684
00:34:03,877 --> 00:34:05,167
You need to move out.

685
00:34:06,046 --> 00:34:07,836
Rudy, you need to move out, too.

686
00:34:07,881 --> 00:34:08,801
What?

687
00:34:08,841 --> 00:34:10,971
There's more room in the basement
for me now.

688
00:34:11,635 --> 00:34:12,725
And another thing, Rudy.

689
00:34:12,761 --> 00:34:15,221
Tomorrow, I would like to have a meeting
with you and Trudy at your office...

690
00:34:15,264 --> 00:34:18,814
to discuss her investing
in the manufacturing of my new idea.

691
00:34:19,226 --> 00:34:20,226
No.

692
00:34:20,269 --> 00:34:22,229
I'm still getting to know her
and falling in love.

693
00:34:22,271 --> 00:34:24,481
I can't do that. I won't do that.

694
00:34:24,982 --> 00:34:27,362
And what manufacturing idea?
What are you talking about?

695
00:34:28,819 --> 00:34:32,159
I have always been there for you,
no matter what.

696
00:34:32,531 --> 00:34:33,911
I didn't go away to school.

697
00:34:33,949 --> 00:34:36,789
I stayed to help you and Mom
through the divorce and do your accounting.

698
00:34:37,035 --> 00:34:39,365
I let you live here whenever you want...

699
00:34:39,788 --> 00:34:41,618
no matter what it is.

700
00:34:42,374 --> 00:34:46,844
I am respectfully asking
for the favor that you owe me.

701
00:34:48,172 --> 00:34:50,972
If you look into your heart,
you'll know that I'm right.

702
00:34:55,596 --> 00:35:00,766
Cristy, I need to use your crayons,
your colored pencils and your paper.

703
00:35:01,518 --> 00:35:03,018
Let's go to my room.

704
00:35:39,014 --> 00:35:40,224
You're not gonna believe this.

705
00:35:40,265 --> 00:35:42,515
So, you know that plumber
that you recommended?

706
00:35:42,559 --> 00:35:43,729
Yeah, Touissant.

707
00:35:43,769 --> 00:35:47,519
So I hire him, Terry freaks out,
completely disoriented.

708
00:35:47,564 --> 00:35:50,194
Hasn't had a man in her room
for eight years, since Rudy.

709
00:35:50,234 --> 00:35:52,034
Makes me hang a drop cloth.

710
00:35:52,069 --> 00:35:53,239
The way I look at it...

711
00:35:53,278 --> 00:35:56,568
is that this is an opportunity
for you to invest in a new business...

712
00:35:58,408 --> 00:36:00,238
that'll mean more money for you.

713
00:36:01,828 --> 00:36:03,618
Tell Rico, Dad. Number five's gotta go off.

714
00:36:03,664 --> 00:36:06,584
Rico, number five, no, off.

715
00:36:06,625 --> 00:36:08,885
Go off! Thank you!

716
00:36:09,962 --> 00:36:12,382
It's a standard handle, 53 inches.

717
00:36:12,422 --> 00:36:14,552
The sleeve connects to the mop head.

718
00:36:14,591 --> 00:36:16,761
Now, this is where it gets complicated.

719
00:36:17,094 --> 00:36:20,184
There's a clip
that connects the sleeve to the...

720
00:36:20,764 --> 00:36:23,274
I don't even know what to call it.
The "cup."

721
00:36:23,767 --> 00:36:25,307
Which is connected to the mop head.

722
00:36:25,644 --> 00:36:29,064
So, when you pull up on the sleeve,
the mop head stretches...

723
00:36:29,106 --> 00:36:31,646
so you can wring it
without ever touching it with your hands.

724
00:36:32,109 --> 00:36:35,319
The only thing we see
is this crayon drawings.

725
00:36:35,362 --> 00:36:36,742
We can't make heads or tails.

726
00:36:37,322 --> 00:36:38,742
We don't know what it is.

727
00:36:39,366 --> 00:36:42,616
So, the mop doesn't hang loose, like hair?
Like a string?

728
00:36:42,661 --> 00:36:44,911
It hangs, but not on loose,
open ends like hair.

729
00:36:44,955 --> 00:36:46,755
It's one continuous loop.

730
00:36:46,790 --> 00:36:47,870
- I don't get it.
- I don't get it.

731
00:36:47,916 --> 00:36:50,416
- I don't get it. What's he doing here?
- What's he doing here?

732
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:53,630
He is the father of our children,
and my friend, and he looks out for me.

733
00:37:01,471 --> 00:37:03,471
We're doing an invention.

734
00:37:03,891 --> 00:37:05,021
Cheers.

735
00:37:05,517 --> 00:37:06,687
Right.

736
00:37:08,770 --> 00:37:10,610
Yes we are, Cristy.

737
00:37:11,398 --> 00:37:13,148
It's very serious.

738
00:37:13,817 --> 00:37:15,437
It's priority.

739
00:37:15,485 --> 00:37:16,945
Yes it is.

740
00:37:16,987 --> 00:37:17,857
And I'm helping.

741
00:37:17,905 --> 00:37:19,575
Yes you are.

742
00:37:29,541 --> 00:37:31,751
Ça se fait comme ça in Haiti.

743
00:37:31,793 --> 00:37:34,003
Touissant is teaching me
how to speak French.

744
00:37:34,630 --> 00:37:36,550
And the word for "industrious" is...

745
00:37:38,258 --> 00:37:39,338
Yes.

746
00:37:39,384 --> 00:37:41,304
At first I thought maybe
something scary would happen...

747
00:37:41,345 --> 00:37:45,395
like what happened with Danica
while she was kidnapped by a man...

748
00:37:45,432 --> 00:37:48,142
who turned out to be in hiding
from the royal family in Switzerland...

749
00:37:48,185 --> 00:37:50,565
and then she moved to Switzerland.

750
00:37:50,604 --> 00:37:52,774
Of course, she befriended that man
and more.

751
00:37:53,232 --> 00:37:55,322
Don't ever try and limit me, Joy.

752
00:37:55,359 --> 00:37:57,439
And let me know if you want some
of this Chakalaka.

753
00:37:57,486 --> 00:37:58,606
Chaka. Say "chaka."

754
00:37:58,654 --> 00:37:59,454
Chaka.

755
00:37:59,488 --> 00:38:00,488
It's very good.

756
00:38:08,413 --> 00:38:10,173
Hey, Rocky. Hey, Tom!

757
00:38:11,875 --> 00:38:13,205
Take her inside the office.

758
00:38:14,211 --> 00:38:16,711
- Hey, Tino.
- Hey, Joy.

759
00:38:16,755 --> 00:38:18,755
I wanted to show you something.

760
00:38:18,799 --> 00:38:20,339
So, will you help me figure this out?

761
00:38:20,384 --> 00:38:23,474
I know that it has to be welded.
This part is supposed to twist.

762
00:38:49,955 --> 00:38:53,885
1... 2... 3...

763
00:38:54,168 --> 00:38:57,088
4, 5, 6...

764
00:38:57,754 --> 00:38:58,754
What are you doing?

765
00:39:04,469 --> 00:39:07,759
38, 39, 40.

766
00:39:08,098 --> 00:39:11,228
All right. All right, Dad,
come over here and grab this.

767
00:39:11,268 --> 00:39:12,938
Grab it right in the middle.

768
00:39:17,482 --> 00:39:18,692
Okay. There.

769
00:39:18,734 --> 00:39:21,404
And go up, Jackie go down. You see it?

770
00:39:21,445 --> 00:39:22,455
Not yet.

771
00:39:22,487 --> 00:39:24,527
All right. Here.

772
00:39:25,449 --> 00:39:26,779
- How about now?
- No.

773
00:39:27,242 --> 00:39:28,952
Well you're going to.

774
00:39:28,994 --> 00:39:31,204
I don't see it yet, I mean...

775
00:39:35,501 --> 00:39:37,631
- You ready?
- Yeah.

776
00:39:44,718 --> 00:39:47,298
300 feet of continuous cotton loops.

777
00:39:47,721 --> 00:39:49,311
That's what I drew.

778
00:39:50,057 --> 00:39:54,477
This is why I would like to ask you
for your investment, Trudy.

779
00:39:55,646 --> 00:39:59,436
Morris worked 50 years
to earn his fortune, Joy.

780
00:40:00,442 --> 00:40:04,992
Before he passed on to the next world,
he made me promise on his deathbed...

781
00:40:05,030 --> 00:40:09,160
that I would never be neglectful
with one dollar of the money...

782
00:40:09,201 --> 00:40:11,291
that he so carefully earned.

783
00:40:11,995 --> 00:40:17,415
Therefore you have to answer Morris's
four questions of financial worthiness.

784
00:40:17,459 --> 00:40:18,589
Are you ready?

785
00:40:19,711 --> 00:40:21,091
I think so. Yes.

786
00:40:22,673 --> 00:40:24,303
Question number one:

787
00:40:25,050 --> 00:40:27,340
Where did you go to high school?

788
00:40:27,386 --> 00:40:29,046
Plainfield Public High.

789
00:40:29,096 --> 00:40:33,346
Question number two:
Who were you in high school?

790
00:40:34,101 --> 00:40:35,561
I was valedictorian.

791
00:40:36,687 --> 00:40:39,187
The smartest student in the school.

792
00:40:39,231 --> 00:40:40,521
That's good, right?

793
00:40:41,441 --> 00:40:42,611
Perhaps.

794
00:40:43,193 --> 00:40:48,913
Joy might be a brilliant,
unrealized creator of commerce.

795
00:40:49,366 --> 00:40:50,486
But on the other hand...

796
00:40:50,534 --> 00:40:54,504
it's equally possible that she is
a fatally flawed underachiever...

797
00:40:54,538 --> 00:40:59,668
doomed to a lifetime of failure,
disappointment, unfulfilled expectations.

798
00:41:00,752 --> 00:41:02,462
You must admit, Joy...

799
00:41:02,504 --> 00:41:05,554
that your life, to date,
makes a stronger case for...

800
00:41:06,550 --> 00:41:07,880
disappointment.

801
00:41:10,095 --> 00:41:11,635
I don't care about any of this.

802
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:14,560
It's not only risky,
but it's fiscally irresponsible...

803
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:17,060
and doesn't make any sense, whatsoever.

804
00:41:17,102 --> 00:41:18,602
Joy's never run a business in her life.

805
00:41:18,645 --> 00:41:20,965
I've been running my father's garage
for the last 10 years.

806
00:41:21,648 --> 00:41:23,228
Our father.

807
00:41:24,443 --> 00:41:26,953
I have ventures that I'm planning
to launch here...

808
00:41:26,987 --> 00:41:29,027
at this existing business.

809
00:41:29,072 --> 00:41:31,532
You never mentioned any of this...

810
00:41:31,575 --> 00:41:33,745
until I came to Trudy
to ask for an investment.

811
00:41:34,578 --> 00:41:37,038
What's Morris's third question?

812
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:38,540
Are you prepared...

813
00:41:38,582 --> 00:41:42,092
within six months of commencing
this venture...

814
00:41:42,127 --> 00:41:44,127
to show adequate returns?

815
00:41:44,963 --> 00:41:46,723
I accept your terms.

816
00:41:46,757 --> 00:41:48,217
Don't do it, Joy.

817
00:41:48,258 --> 00:41:50,258
What's the fourth question?

818
00:41:50,302 --> 00:41:54,812
You are in a room,
and there is a gun on the table.

819
00:41:54,848 --> 00:41:59,558
And the only other person in the room
is an adversary in commerce.

820
00:41:59,603 --> 00:42:01,983
Only one of you can prevail.

821
00:42:02,022 --> 00:42:07,782
Yet, you have protected your business
and Morris's money.

822
00:42:09,738 --> 00:42:11,948
Do you pick up the gun, Joy?

823
00:42:13,534 --> 00:42:15,794
That's a very strange question.

824
00:42:15,827 --> 00:42:19,827
There is nothing strange
about this question at all.

825
00:42:19,873 --> 00:42:21,793
This is money.

826
00:42:23,001 --> 00:42:26,801
Do you pick up the gun?

827
00:42:27,756 --> 00:42:29,336
I pick up the gun.

828
00:42:29,383 --> 00:42:30,513
Good.

829
00:42:31,426 --> 00:42:33,886
I'm going to remember that you said that...

830
00:42:34,888 --> 00:42:37,348
when I speak to my lawyer.

831
00:42:38,392 --> 00:42:40,772
What did Trudy's lawyer say?

832
00:42:40,811 --> 00:42:42,901
He did a worldwide patent search.

833
00:42:42,938 --> 00:42:44,358
What's a patent?

834
00:42:45,274 --> 00:42:48,744
A patent is like a law
that you get to protect your idea.

835
00:42:49,111 --> 00:42:51,361
A lot of people patent their ideas...

836
00:42:51,405 --> 00:42:54,075
but only a few of them
actually get their ideas made.

837
00:42:54,908 --> 00:42:56,948
So Trudy just wanted to be careful...

838
00:42:56,994 --> 00:42:58,374
Joy...

839
00:42:58,412 --> 00:43:02,372
I just wanted to let you know that
Touissant has almost finished his work.

840
00:43:02,416 --> 00:43:03,746
And, um...

841
00:43:05,169 --> 00:43:07,629
You know, we really need to find
some more work for him.

842
00:43:07,671 --> 00:43:09,961
- You want more work in the house?
- Yeah.

843
00:43:10,007 --> 00:43:11,797
I have another big job I have to go to.

844
00:43:12,676 --> 00:43:14,296
- What?
- Yes.

845
00:43:14,344 --> 00:43:16,474
- Well, but we have real issues here.
- Sorry.

846
00:43:16,972 --> 00:43:18,972
- We don't have money for that work, Mom.
- Well...

847
00:43:19,683 --> 00:43:20,683
Okay.

848
00:43:21,935 --> 00:43:23,435
Joy...

849
00:43:23,937 --> 00:43:25,357
What is happening to you, Mother?

850
00:43:25,397 --> 00:43:27,187
I don't know what's going on.

851
00:43:27,232 --> 00:43:28,862
Are you in love with Touissant?

852
00:43:30,027 --> 00:43:32,357
I was feeling alone.

853
00:43:33,822 --> 00:43:37,032
And I didn't even realize it,
you know?

854
00:43:37,075 --> 00:43:38,235
And then...

855
00:43:43,707 --> 00:43:45,877
What did the patent search find?

856
00:43:47,127 --> 00:43:49,207
Trudy just wanted to be careful.

857
00:43:49,671 --> 00:43:52,221
And this guy found a man that's in Texas...

858
00:43:52,257 --> 00:43:55,007
who worked for another guy
in another country...

859
00:43:55,052 --> 00:44:00,022
where they have an idea
that might be similar to my mop.

860
00:44:00,057 --> 00:44:01,307
What country?

861
00:44:01,808 --> 00:44:02,848
Hong Kong.

862
00:44:02,893 --> 00:44:06,693
The Hong Kong man
has a representative in Dallas, Texas.

863
00:44:06,730 --> 00:44:10,400
The Dallas man was very reasonable
with my lawyer.

864
00:44:11,693 --> 00:44:12,743
Hey.

865
00:44:19,743 --> 00:44:21,373
So, this guy in Texas...

866
00:44:22,246 --> 00:44:26,076
We're supposed to pay him a royalty
on the patent as a protection, right?

867
00:44:26,333 --> 00:44:27,043
Right.

868
00:44:27,084 --> 00:44:28,714
To be safe from any claims.

869
00:44:28,752 --> 00:44:29,922
Is that correct?

870
00:44:29,962 --> 00:44:32,052
Please stop using the word "we."

871
00:44:32,089 --> 00:44:34,549
None of this is your money
or your business.

872
00:44:34,591 --> 00:44:38,431
But the same guy
also owns a manufacturing plant...

873
00:44:38,470 --> 00:44:41,560
that you guys say that it's cheaper
than any other place?

874
00:44:41,598 --> 00:44:43,308
- Yes. In California.
- Yes.

875
00:44:43,350 --> 00:44:45,890
A metal and plastic injection mold factory.

876
00:44:45,936 --> 00:44:47,056
Okay, so it's the same guy.

877
00:44:47,104 --> 00:44:48,864
- He owns the patent...
- This happens all the time in business.

878
00:44:48,897 --> 00:44:51,267
You find the best partner. It's smart.

879
00:44:51,316 --> 00:44:53,686
He doesn't understand business.
He doesn't know business.

880
00:44:53,735 --> 00:44:56,105
- No, no, I'm the first to say that.
- I understand business.

881
00:44:56,154 --> 00:44:59,574
Dad and I, we buy parts for the trucks
all the time at the garage.

882
00:44:59,616 --> 00:45:01,406
Morris did it all the time.

883
00:45:01,451 --> 00:45:03,871
One-stop shopping. It's the cheapest.

884
00:45:03,912 --> 00:45:05,332
- But is that normal?
- That's how he made his money.

885
00:45:05,372 --> 00:45:06,542
- Yeah, that's normal.
- Yes!

886
00:45:06,582 --> 00:45:08,382
But is it normal, the same guy
who has the patent...

887
00:45:08,417 --> 00:45:10,097
is the same guy who has the manufacturing?

888
00:45:10,127 --> 00:45:11,457
- Yeah. Make it best.
- Yeah.

889
00:45:11,503 --> 00:45:13,423
- Yeah?
- Better if it's that way.

890
00:45:13,463 --> 00:45:15,593
Okay, and the lawyer?
Right? Morris's lawyer?

891
00:45:15,632 --> 00:45:17,342
- He's good. Let's not make trouble.
- He's very good.

892
00:45:17,384 --> 00:45:21,764
But he specialized in garment business, no?
Not manufacturing business.

893
00:45:21,805 --> 00:45:25,385
Tony. Let's quit while we're ahead.

894
00:45:27,519 --> 00:45:31,939
I know that you want Tony
to be your counselor, if you will...

895
00:45:31,982 --> 00:45:34,032
and I will respect that...

896
00:45:34,067 --> 00:45:38,527
as Tony and you should respect
what we're proposing...

897
00:45:38,572 --> 00:45:41,912
as the lawyer
for this whole business endeavor.

898
00:45:46,580 --> 00:45:49,670
All right. The parts have arrived
from California...

899
00:45:49,708 --> 00:45:51,998
and we can start manufacturing here.

900
00:45:52,503 --> 00:45:54,843
I have the first assembled mop.

901
00:45:55,506 --> 00:45:57,836
I told you it was gonna be more refined.

902
00:45:58,634 --> 00:45:59,844
And it is.

903
00:46:01,220 --> 00:46:02,350
Father Martinez is here.

904
00:46:02,387 --> 00:46:04,597
You need to set those women up right now
and get going.

905
00:46:05,057 --> 00:46:06,927
They're gonna be so grateful
for the jobs, Joy.

906
00:46:06,975 --> 00:46:08,555
Okay. All right.
I'll go talk to those ladies.

907
00:46:08,602 --> 00:46:10,902
Now I finally have jobs for them.

908
00:46:42,845 --> 00:46:44,895
And I'll show you guys how to assemble...

909
00:47:07,786 --> 00:47:09,946
I'm a little proud of you.
I gotta admit it.

910
00:47:11,164 --> 00:47:16,634
But, it costs much more than $15,000
to make the first run.

911
00:47:16,670 --> 00:47:17,840
I know, Trudy.

912
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:20,080
But with all due respect,
that actually wasn't my fault.

913
00:47:20,424 --> 00:47:22,384
Look at this. More bills.

914
00:47:24,595 --> 00:47:26,935
- What?
- Another bill from Gerhardt.

915
00:47:26,972 --> 00:47:29,722
This guy keeps billing me
for his mistakes.

916
00:47:29,766 --> 00:47:31,846
- That's business.
- No.

917
00:47:31,894 --> 00:47:33,694
That's not the way I do business.

918
00:47:33,729 --> 00:47:35,229
I'm calling this guy.

919
00:47:40,611 --> 00:47:42,701
Gerhardt, I'm not gonna
keep paying for these parts...

920
00:47:42,738 --> 00:47:44,358
that it's taking
you four times to get right.

921
00:47:44,406 --> 00:47:47,406
That was your design.
You have to pay for those parts.

922
00:47:47,451 --> 00:47:50,331
That's mold-making.
That's the process.

923
00:47:50,370 --> 00:47:52,750
My clients pay when we figure it out.

924
00:47:52,789 --> 00:47:54,459
It was not my design, Gerhardt.

925
00:47:54,499 --> 00:47:57,039
It was your mistake. I'm not paying it.

926
00:47:57,085 --> 00:47:59,625
That was your design.
You have to pay.

927
00:47:59,671 --> 00:48:01,591
Did you just hang up on him?

928
00:48:01,632 --> 00:48:05,092
This guy was supposed to be easy
and inexpensive.

929
00:48:05,135 --> 00:48:07,755
He keeps overbilling us.
I'm not paying for it.

930
00:48:09,348 --> 00:48:11,728
Nobody pay it.

931
00:48:11,767 --> 00:48:13,937
I'm gonna fight it out with this guy.

932
00:48:13,977 --> 00:48:17,107
Just assemble them and try to sell them.

933
00:48:17,147 --> 00:48:19,607
Just put it in your window.
Let your customers decide.

934
00:48:19,650 --> 00:48:21,190
My family's been going to you
my whole life.

935
00:48:21,235 --> 00:48:24,155
Look, the big companies,
they pay me for my shelf space.

936
00:48:24,655 --> 00:48:27,245
Maybe you can sell one of your mops
to those big companies.

937
00:48:27,282 --> 00:48:29,912
And maybe they'll put it on my shelf.

938
00:48:31,119 --> 00:48:35,579
It's expensive, at $19.95,
but it's the only mop you'll ever have to buy.

939
00:48:35,624 --> 00:48:39,884
But I don't want people
to buy one mop for $20...

940
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:41,670
and never have to buy another mop again.

941
00:48:41,713 --> 00:48:46,683
I'd rather they keep buying our mops at $5,
50 times, 100 times.

942
00:48:47,553 --> 00:48:52,103
Look, you were broke and bored.
You had an idea.

943
00:48:52,140 --> 00:48:54,310
So what? Lots of people have ideas.

944
00:48:54,768 --> 00:48:57,438
Go home.
Please, take care of your family.

945
00:48:58,522 --> 00:49:00,652
Hi. Would you like to try a new mop?

946
00:49:00,691 --> 00:49:03,781
It's the only mop
you'll ever have to buy.

947
00:49:04,778 --> 00:49:06,988
- Hi. Would you like to try a new mop?
- No.

948
00:49:07,030 --> 00:49:08,450
It's self-wringing.

949
00:49:08,490 --> 00:49:10,910
You can remove the mop head,
throw it in the washing machine.

950
00:49:10,951 --> 00:49:12,081
- No germs.
- No.

951
00:49:12,119 --> 00:49:13,119
No.

952
00:49:13,579 --> 00:49:15,329
- No?
- Look at that.

953
00:49:15,372 --> 00:49:17,372
You want to just try it?
You could just try.

954
00:49:17,416 --> 00:49:20,586
It can self-wring. See?
No other mop does this.

955
00:49:41,773 --> 00:49:44,233
Come and try the brand-new mop!

956
00:49:45,444 --> 00:49:47,324
- It's the mop of the future.
- No, thanks.

957
00:49:48,363 --> 00:49:49,703
Want to try this mop, ladies?

958
00:49:49,740 --> 00:49:51,030
- What's this?
- Hey, miss.

959
00:49:51,074 --> 00:49:52,414
It's a brand-new mop.

960
00:49:53,577 --> 00:49:55,537
You could wring it
without getting your hands dirty.

961
00:49:55,579 --> 00:49:56,709
I don't think so.

962
00:49:56,747 --> 00:49:59,667
Come on. Try it.
It's the mop of the future.

963
00:50:01,418 --> 00:50:02,538
Self-wringing, huh?

964
00:50:02,586 --> 00:50:03,586
Yeah.

965
00:50:03,629 --> 00:50:06,049
All right. I do like the idea of that.

966
00:50:06,089 --> 00:50:10,049
I hate having to touch the mop head after
I get done cleaning the bathroom floor.

967
00:50:10,093 --> 00:50:11,473
I always think that's disgusting,
you know?

968
00:50:11,512 --> 00:50:12,682
It's so gross.

969
00:50:12,721 --> 00:50:16,601
Wow. It really does get all the corners
that my sponge mop won't get.

970
00:50:16,892 --> 00:50:20,062
All those crannies
where my kids spill their juice.

971
00:50:20,979 --> 00:50:23,149
I really like it. Can we buy it?

972
00:50:23,190 --> 00:50:24,610
Take it easy, Cristy.

973
00:50:24,942 --> 00:50:28,072
Wow. I mean, that's just amazing.
You really don't have to touch it.

974
00:50:28,111 --> 00:50:29,241
Look at that.

975
00:50:29,279 --> 00:50:30,609
You know what would make this perfect...

976
00:50:30,656 --> 00:50:33,066
if you could remove the mop head,
put it in the washing machine...

977
00:50:33,116 --> 00:50:34,776
- Really get it clean.
- That'd be great.

978
00:50:35,536 --> 00:50:36,746
- You can.
- What?

979
00:50:36,787 --> 00:50:37,907
Are you serious?

980
00:50:37,955 --> 00:50:40,255
- Well how much is this mop?
- It's $19.95.

981
00:50:40,290 --> 00:50:41,420
No, that's too much.

982
00:50:41,458 --> 00:50:44,258
But I guess, I mean, if it is the only mop
that you ever have to buy...

983
00:50:44,294 --> 00:50:45,424
I mean we keep buying those
$5 mops.

984
00:50:45,462 --> 00:50:46,802
- Hi, Daddy.
- Hi, sweetie.

985
00:50:46,839 --> 00:50:51,889
You, you remember Angela?
And her two brothers, right?

986
00:50:51,927 --> 00:50:53,717
I do. Hello.

987
00:50:53,762 --> 00:50:55,562
- Mommy, the policeman.
- Ma'am?

988
00:50:55,597 --> 00:50:56,927
Did we break the law?

989
00:50:56,974 --> 00:50:59,274
- I'm taking this merchandise.
- No, no. We're leaving. We're leaving.

990
00:50:59,309 --> 00:51:01,019
- Now, I'm gonna let you off with a warning.
- We were just leaving.

991
00:51:01,061 --> 00:51:02,481
No. Sir...

992
00:51:02,521 --> 00:51:04,271
If the customers can just see
what the mop can do...

993
00:51:04,314 --> 00:51:06,154
But if I catch you out here again,
you will be prosecuted!

994
00:51:06,191 --> 00:51:07,401
Well, where do I go?
Sir, please!

995
00:51:07,442 --> 00:51:09,612
- You cannot sell on Kmart property!
- I made those mops myself.

996
00:51:09,653 --> 00:51:11,403
- I paid for them. Please.
- It took a lot of work.

997
00:51:11,446 --> 00:51:13,606
I won't come back,
but you don't have to take my stuff!

998
00:51:13,824 --> 00:51:14,784
Please!

999
00:51:14,825 --> 00:51:17,045
- Are you even allowed to do this?
- How embarrassing for you...

1000
00:51:17,077 --> 00:51:18,697
to be seen here like this
with your daughter.

1001
00:51:18,745 --> 00:51:20,825
- What kind of parent are you, huh?
- Yeah, Tony.

1002
00:51:20,873 --> 00:51:22,003
- Enough.
- Hey.

1003
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:23,040
Hey, hey, guys. Guys...

1004
00:51:23,083 --> 00:51:24,213
- All right.
- Come on.

1005
00:51:24,251 --> 00:51:25,631
- Let's go.
- Tony, let's go.

1006
00:51:25,669 --> 00:51:27,209
Yeah, I'm coming. I'm coming.

1007
00:51:38,223 --> 00:51:41,063
Cristy, honey, it's okay.
Your mommy's okay.

1008
00:51:44,605 --> 00:51:47,905
This stupid thing.
This place is falling apart!

1009
00:51:47,941 --> 00:51:49,531
No... No.

1010
00:51:51,528 --> 00:51:53,568
Honey, the telephone isn't working.

1011
00:51:53,614 --> 00:51:55,164
I know. I just got the notice.

1012
00:51:55,199 --> 00:51:58,489
I had to go next door to use the phone.
Tommy's got a fever.

1013
00:51:58,535 --> 00:51:59,655
Tommy has a fever?

1014
00:51:59,703 --> 00:52:02,623
Simple cold with a cough.
It's going around. All the kids have it.

1015
00:52:02,664 --> 00:52:04,174
Thank God the heat's still working.

1016
00:52:04,208 --> 00:52:06,498
Mommy, why isn't the phone working?

1017
00:52:06,543 --> 00:52:08,213
Because I'm late on paying the bill.

1018
00:52:09,254 --> 00:52:10,964
- Are we gonna lose our house?
- Not you too.

1019
00:52:11,006 --> 00:52:12,586
No, we're not gonna lose our house.

1020
00:52:13,675 --> 00:52:15,255
Come on. Get upstairs. Get in the bath.

1021
00:52:15,302 --> 00:52:16,762
Listen to your mom and get
right in that tub.

1022
00:52:16,803 --> 00:52:18,603
- I don't want a hot bath.
- I don't care.

1023
00:52:18,639 --> 00:52:20,809
Cristy, you get in that hot bath.
Listen to your mother.

1024
00:52:20,849 --> 00:52:22,729
I don't want you getting sick too.

1025
00:52:23,435 --> 00:52:27,105
Lauren Wells said you're a cleaning lady
and sell used mops.

1026
00:52:28,732 --> 00:52:30,482
Lauren Wells said that?

1027
00:52:31,527 --> 00:52:34,237
Yeah. And it really hurt my feelings.

1028
00:52:34,905 --> 00:52:38,285
First of all, even if I was
a cleaning lady, so what?

1029
00:52:38,325 --> 00:52:40,125
There's no shame in hard work.

1030
00:52:41,495 --> 00:52:43,335
And second of all, you know, I'm...

1031
00:52:44,998 --> 00:52:48,588
I'm trying to sell a new mop,
not used mops.

1032
00:52:49,169 --> 00:52:54,379
And third of all,
don't take any guff from anybody.

1033
00:52:54,883 --> 00:52:58,093
You know, don't let it in.

1034
00:52:58,846 --> 00:53:01,886
I know it's hard.
And I'm sorry that happened.

1035
00:53:03,517 --> 00:53:04,807
Now get in the bath.

1036
00:53:12,693 --> 00:53:14,493
Come on. Go to sleep, honey.

1037
00:53:28,959 --> 00:53:30,089
Joy?

1038
00:53:30,335 --> 00:53:31,835
Not now, Mimi.

1039
00:53:31,879 --> 00:53:34,919
Joy, wait, wait.
Just tell me what happened today.

1040
00:53:34,965 --> 00:53:37,345
I want to know how it went.
Please, I want to know.

1041
00:53:39,595 --> 00:53:41,015
It was a disaster.

1042
00:53:41,930 --> 00:53:43,140
But you must never give up.

1043
00:53:43,182 --> 00:53:44,892
Ever since you were little,
you were born to bear...

1044
00:53:44,933 --> 00:53:47,143
Born to bear what, Mimi?

1045
00:53:48,020 --> 00:53:50,480
Failure? Disgrace?

1046
00:53:51,690 --> 00:53:53,980
Humiliation in front of my daughter?

1047
00:53:54,735 --> 00:53:58,825
You were born to be
the unanxious presence in the room.

1048
00:53:58,864 --> 00:54:01,914
And I know that I'm gonna live
to see you grow...

1049
00:54:01,950 --> 00:54:05,330
to be the successful matriarch
that you were born to be.

1050
00:54:05,370 --> 00:54:06,370
Matriarch...

1051
00:54:07,664 --> 00:54:09,044
To be a mother with courage.

1052
00:54:09,082 --> 00:54:10,962
Who can't even support her children.

1053
00:54:11,376 --> 00:54:12,456
Sweetheart.

1054
00:54:16,423 --> 00:54:18,383
What are you doing here?

1055
00:54:18,425 --> 00:54:20,135
I have this idea.

1056
00:54:20,177 --> 00:54:21,927
- A guy I know.
- What guy?

1057
00:54:21,970 --> 00:54:27,140
He used to work with me.
And now he works at this big retailer.

1058
00:54:27,184 --> 00:54:29,484
A new way of doing business.

1059
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:31,310
I mean, it's worth a try.

1060
00:54:32,689 --> 00:54:34,729
You would do that for me?

1061
00:54:34,775 --> 00:54:36,035
Of course.

1062
00:54:36,068 --> 00:54:38,528
They were the best divorced couple
in America.

1063
00:54:39,488 --> 00:54:42,198
Much better friends than they were
husband and wife.

1064
00:54:43,116 --> 00:54:44,656
I can get you a meeting with him.

1065
00:54:47,120 --> 00:54:48,460
Where is it?

1066
00:54:52,042 --> 00:54:54,292
But I don't understand
what we're doing in Amish country.

1067
00:54:54,336 --> 00:54:56,956
They don't even have electricity out here.
How could they sell anything on TV?

1068
00:54:57,005 --> 00:54:59,375
It has nothing to do with Amish people.

1069
00:54:59,424 --> 00:55:02,014
It just happens to be located here.
I looked it up.

1070
00:55:02,052 --> 00:55:03,802
In Amish country.

1071
00:55:03,846 --> 00:55:04,796
Amish.

1072
00:55:04,847 --> 00:55:05,677
What?

1073
00:55:05,722 --> 00:55:07,722
- Amish.
- Amish.

1074
00:55:19,736 --> 00:55:21,066
Sign in, please.

1075
00:55:22,948 --> 00:55:25,578
We're here to see Marv Brickman.

1076
00:55:26,201 --> 00:55:27,491
Okay.

1077
00:55:27,536 --> 00:55:31,076
Marv Brickman, does he know who you are
if I call his office?

1078
00:55:31,748 --> 00:55:32,868
Of course he knows.

1079
00:55:32,916 --> 00:55:34,666
We're friends. We used to work together.

1080
00:55:36,420 --> 00:55:38,090
QVC, please hold.

1081
00:55:49,308 --> 00:55:51,888
But Tom was wrong about that.
He was wrong about the numbers...

1082
00:55:56,064 --> 00:55:57,274
Tony.

1083
00:55:57,316 --> 00:55:58,606
Marv. How are you?

1084
00:55:58,650 --> 00:56:00,150
I can't see you today.

1085
00:56:00,194 --> 00:56:01,574
Why?

1086
00:56:01,612 --> 00:56:03,572
Maybe tomorrow if you can stay in town.

1087
00:56:03,614 --> 00:56:06,074
No, we left the kids at home.
We can't.

1088
00:56:06,116 --> 00:56:08,026
We can't stay until tomorrow.

1089
00:56:08,076 --> 00:56:11,156
Listen, you can't just expect
to come in here and see someone.

1090
00:56:11,205 --> 00:56:12,625
Hey, did you take care
of that advertising thing?

1091
00:56:12,664 --> 00:56:14,874
- Yes, I did.
- Good. All right.

1092
00:56:14,917 --> 00:56:16,037
What's going on here?

1093
00:56:16,084 --> 00:56:17,924
- This is my good friend, Tony.
- Tony Miranda.

1094
00:56:17,961 --> 00:56:19,421
We worked together at Campbell's.

1095
00:56:19,463 --> 00:56:20,423
Neil Walker.

1096
00:56:20,464 --> 00:56:22,264
- And this is his ex-wife.
- Good to meet you.

1097
00:56:22,299 --> 00:56:23,629
- Joy.
- Hi. Neil.

1098
00:56:23,675 --> 00:56:24,835
She's an inventor.

1099
00:56:24,885 --> 00:56:28,015
She wanted two minutes of your time today,
but, Neil, don't worry about this.

1100
00:56:28,055 --> 00:56:29,475
- Maybe tomorrow.
- You know what?

1101
00:56:29,515 --> 00:56:32,275
Why don't you come in for five minutes
while the sales group's still here.

1102
00:56:32,309 --> 00:56:33,869
- Okay. Hold my bag.
- Neil, are you sure?

1103
00:56:33,894 --> 00:56:35,234
- Yeah.
- Yeah, absolutely.

1104
00:56:35,270 --> 00:56:36,650
Thank you.

1105
00:56:36,688 --> 00:56:37,858
- Got everything?
- Yeah.

1106
00:56:37,898 --> 00:56:39,318
Great. Thank you, man.

1107
00:56:40,317 --> 00:56:41,477
Thank you.

1108
00:56:49,576 --> 00:56:51,236
So tell us your name, please.

1109
00:56:54,998 --> 00:56:56,168
I'm Joy.

1110
00:56:58,293 --> 00:57:00,303
And what would you like
to show us today?

1111
00:57:00,337 --> 00:57:02,627
I have a self-wringing mop.

1112
00:57:04,174 --> 00:57:05,054
Just...

1113
00:57:05,092 --> 00:57:06,092
Do you need some help?

1114
00:57:06,134 --> 00:57:07,304
No. No, no.

1115
00:57:07,803 --> 00:57:08,853
All right.

1116
00:57:10,013 --> 00:57:11,813
That's my shoe.

1117
00:57:11,849 --> 00:57:13,679
Oh, my goodness. I am so sorry, sir.

1118
00:57:15,936 --> 00:57:17,476
Sock's wet.

1119
00:57:17,521 --> 00:57:18,691
Do you mind?

1120
00:57:19,857 --> 00:57:20,937
Sorry.

1121
00:57:24,653 --> 00:57:26,203
Is that plastic?

1122
00:57:26,238 --> 00:57:26,988
Yes.

1123
00:57:27,030 --> 00:57:29,030
Arnold, why don't you give it a try?
Is that okay?

1124
00:57:29,074 --> 00:57:30,244
Yes, of course.

1125
00:57:30,868 --> 00:57:32,158
Just dunk it.

1126
00:57:32,202 --> 00:57:33,702
- I dip it?
- Yes.

1127
00:57:34,121 --> 00:57:36,661
And then I... twist it?

1128
00:57:36,707 --> 00:57:38,167
But you pull...
You have to pull it first.

1129
00:57:38,208 --> 00:57:39,578
- Pull it and twist it.
- You got to pull it first before you twist it.

1130
00:57:39,626 --> 00:57:40,836
- I'm pulling it and...
- Pull and twist.

1131
00:57:40,878 --> 00:57:41,918
And I am twisting it.

1132
00:57:42,796 --> 00:57:44,756
Pull and twist,
just like when you're on the road.

1133
00:57:46,675 --> 00:57:50,175
We don't mean to be disrespectful, Joy.
It's the end of a long day for us.

1134
00:57:51,555 --> 00:57:54,935
I feel like I want to tell you
a little bit about who I am.

1135
00:57:54,975 --> 00:57:58,405
Because I have a feeling you don't know
exactly where you are right now.

1136
00:57:58,437 --> 00:57:59,437
Am I right?

1137
00:58:01,064 --> 00:58:02,524
Ten months ago...

1138
00:58:02,566 --> 00:58:06,066
a man named Barry Diller
called me from Los Angeles.

1139
00:58:06,987 --> 00:58:10,907
He started a television network.
Fox television channel.

1140
00:58:11,450 --> 00:58:15,700
And prior to that, he ran 20th Century Fox,
among other studios.

1141
00:58:16,371 --> 00:58:19,121
And he acquired a little cable channel...

1142
00:58:19,166 --> 00:58:21,706
right here in Lancaster, Pennsylvania.

1143
00:58:21,752 --> 00:58:23,712
And he hired me to run it...

1144
00:58:24,421 --> 00:58:26,511
as a bigger idea.

1145
00:58:28,759 --> 00:58:30,679
Now, I'm from Detroit, Michigan.

1146
00:58:32,095 --> 00:58:36,675
I ran America's largest, most affordable...

1147
00:58:36,725 --> 00:58:39,685
successful, value-driven retailer.

1148
00:58:39,728 --> 00:58:41,478
Chain called Kmart.

1149
00:58:42,105 --> 00:58:44,975
Prior to that, I was a buyer for Kmart.

1150
00:58:45,651 --> 00:58:50,111
And prior to that,
I managed seven separate Kmart stores.

1151
00:58:50,572 --> 00:58:53,952
I decide what products
we let into our stores here...

1152
00:58:53,992 --> 00:58:59,002
into people's homes, 24 hours a day,
for our valued customers.

1153
00:59:00,249 --> 00:59:04,169
I choose very carefully
and very conservatively.

1154
00:59:05,170 --> 00:59:09,340
I spend most of my day deflecting
incoming shots from people like yourself.

1155
00:59:12,052 --> 00:59:13,092
You see that chart?

1156
00:59:19,768 --> 00:59:23,808
This green line either rises
or stays the same each month.

1157
00:59:24,690 --> 00:59:27,480
There's no problem
with my product choice.

1158
00:59:28,986 --> 00:59:31,566
Do you know what QVC stands for, Joy?

1159
00:59:33,490 --> 00:59:34,660
No, I don't.

1160
00:59:35,409 --> 00:59:38,749
Quality, Value, Convenience.

1161
00:59:40,539 --> 00:59:43,829
I sell product affordably,
but I don't sell cheap product.

1162
00:59:43,876 --> 00:59:46,376
And your mop is plastic
and it looks strange.

1163
00:59:48,839 --> 00:59:51,339
I don't know anything about charts.

1164
00:59:51,383 --> 00:59:52,383
Or...

1165
00:59:54,094 --> 00:59:55,854
business, frankly.

1166
00:59:56,680 --> 00:59:58,680
But I do clean my own home.

1167
00:59:59,725 --> 01:00:01,815
And I made this mop...

1168
01:00:01,852 --> 01:00:05,022
because it is better
than anything else out there.

1169
01:00:08,233 --> 01:00:09,863
Please give me a chance.

1170
01:00:12,196 --> 01:00:13,656
I like that it's plastic...

1171
01:00:13,697 --> 01:00:16,617
because it's so light in my hands,
it's like nothing.

1172
01:00:17,451 --> 01:00:20,661
It's also ten times more absorbent
than any other mop on the market.

1173
01:00:20,704 --> 01:00:21,714
Why?

1174
01:00:22,539 --> 01:00:27,499
Because of 300 feet of continuous
cotton loop that I looped myself.

1175
01:00:27,544 --> 01:00:30,384
That is an enormous
amount of absorbent cotton...

1176
01:00:30,422 --> 01:00:32,262
on a very small mop head.

1177
01:00:32,299 --> 01:00:35,889
Now I'm done with the bathroom,
and I haven't wrung the mop once.

1178
01:00:35,928 --> 01:00:37,548
Let me ask you a question.

1179
01:00:38,388 --> 01:00:39,848
Would you take this mop...

1180
01:00:39,890 --> 01:00:41,350
where you were
just cleaning the bathroom...

1181
01:00:41,391 --> 01:00:43,271
and around the toilet,
and all of those germs...

1182
01:00:43,644 --> 01:00:45,944
and take it into the kitchen...

1183
01:00:45,979 --> 01:00:48,439
where your family eats,
where you feed your children?

1184
01:00:49,733 --> 01:00:52,783
I take this mop head,
I put it in the washing machine...

1185
01:00:52,819 --> 01:00:54,449
it comes out clean like new.

1186
01:00:55,489 --> 01:00:58,949
You can't do that with any other mop.

1187
01:00:59,409 --> 01:01:00,909
- So...
- Stop.

1188
01:01:04,915 --> 01:01:08,255
Can you make 50,000
of these mops by next week?

1189
01:01:10,504 --> 01:01:12,094
Yeah, I think so.

1190
01:01:14,216 --> 01:01:16,796
David Selznick, the son of immigrants...

1191
01:01:16,844 --> 01:01:20,064
married Jennifer Jones from Oklahoma,
America's sweetheart.

1192
01:01:20,097 --> 01:01:22,427
That just goes to show you
that in America...

1193
01:01:22,474 --> 01:01:26,194
the ordinary meets the extraordinary
every single day.

1194
01:01:26,895 --> 01:01:28,645
Thomas. Where are you going with that?

1195
01:01:28,689 --> 01:01:30,399
The skinny pants you wanted.

1196
01:01:30,440 --> 01:01:33,110
I never said "skinny pants."
I said, "stovepipe." Classic look.

1197
01:01:33,151 --> 01:01:34,491
I heard "skinny pants".

1198
01:01:34,736 --> 01:01:36,946
You know how much I love the stovepipe.

1199
01:01:36,989 --> 01:01:38,909
- Stovepipe. Classic. Got it.
- Got it.

1200
01:01:38,949 --> 01:01:40,669
- Fine, we'll go for stovepipe.
- Thank you.

1201
01:01:42,286 --> 01:01:46,206
See those guys? I told them so many times
and they still don't understand.

1202
01:01:46,248 --> 01:01:48,118
A very smart guy once said...

1203
01:01:48,167 --> 01:01:51,587
"You tell somebody something once, they don't listen.
You tell somebody four times, they don't listen."

1204
01:01:51,628 --> 01:01:54,758
"By the ninth time you say it,
they begin to hear you."

1205
01:01:54,798 --> 01:01:56,678
That's why we're on 24 hours a day.

1206
01:01:56,717 --> 01:01:59,357
That's why, with the people who I have
to tell about the stovepipe.

1207
01:02:00,554 --> 01:02:02,184
Music in the makeup rooms?

1208
01:02:02,222 --> 01:02:03,722
Yeah, I thought it'd
give a sense of place, Todd.

1209
01:02:03,765 --> 01:02:06,095
But if you don't want it,
you can always turn it down.

1210
01:02:06,143 --> 01:02:07,313
You're our biggest seller, Todd.

1211
01:02:07,352 --> 01:02:09,522
Whatever you need to make you comfortable.
You're who we care about.

1212
01:02:09,563 --> 01:02:10,613
You're our number-one seller.

1213
01:02:10,647 --> 01:02:11,857
- What?
- Oh, no.

1214
01:02:13,192 --> 01:02:14,692
He's your number-one seller?

1215
01:02:14,735 --> 01:02:17,955
No, no, no. Cindy, please.
You know that we love you.

1216
01:02:18,822 --> 01:02:20,032
Oh, for heaven sake.

1217
01:02:20,365 --> 01:02:24,405
She's never had a professional attitude.
Clearly, she's jealous.

1218
01:02:24,786 --> 01:02:26,706
But could you do me a favor?
Make her your friend.

1219
01:02:26,747 --> 01:02:30,127
Could you just do me that favor, Todd?
Please?

1220
01:02:30,167 --> 01:02:31,167
For me?

1221
01:02:32,169 --> 01:02:33,249
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you.

1222
01:02:33,295 --> 01:02:36,535
This is Joy. She has a very exciting new mop
that we're gonna introduce next week.

1223
01:02:36,798 --> 01:02:38,928
I would like you to launch it.
You're my first choice.

1224
01:02:38,967 --> 01:02:40,337
A mop?

1225
01:02:40,385 --> 01:02:43,885
You want me to bring this newborn
into the world?

1226
01:02:44,765 --> 01:02:50,355
That newborn that you're holding is
every cent, every dollar, even debt...

1227
01:02:50,395 --> 01:02:51,395
that I've ever made.

1228
01:02:51,980 --> 01:02:53,310
Every cent you've ever made?

1229
01:02:53,607 --> 01:02:54,687
That's right.

1230
01:02:54,733 --> 01:02:56,783
That kind of pressure is not helpful.

1231
01:02:57,236 --> 01:02:58,736
- What?
- No.

1232
01:02:58,779 --> 01:03:00,989
It's not part of my process, either.

1233
01:03:01,406 --> 01:03:02,566
Oh.

1234
01:03:02,866 --> 01:03:06,236
- Todd...
- I didn't mean to pressure you, Todd.

1235
01:03:08,247 --> 01:03:10,647
- Performers can be finicky creatures.
- He's very sensitive.

1236
01:03:10,707 --> 01:03:14,167
He is our number-one seller.
He is selling everything through the roof...

1237
01:03:14,211 --> 01:03:16,381
in numbers we've never seen before.

1238
01:03:16,797 --> 01:03:18,047
I take it very seriously.

1239
01:03:18,090 --> 01:03:20,300
I see it as a privilege that we have
to go into people's homes.

1240
01:03:20,342 --> 01:03:22,092
And I despise anybody
who's cynical about that.

1241
01:03:22,135 --> 01:03:25,635
Jack Warner wasn't cynical about that.
Darryl Zanuck wasn't cynical about that.

1242
01:03:25,681 --> 01:03:27,521
And Neil Walker is not cynical about that.

1243
01:03:27,558 --> 01:03:29,388
Let me show you the stage.

1244
01:03:30,727 --> 01:03:32,727
I believe eventually, one day...

1245
01:03:32,771 --> 01:03:37,731
television will even be
by and about actual regular people.

1246
01:03:37,776 --> 01:03:40,986
Maybe even on computers,
24 hours a day.

1247
01:03:41,238 --> 01:03:43,738
Who knows?
Nobody thought this network would be real.

1248
01:03:44,783 --> 01:03:46,163
And here we are.

1249
01:03:46,910 --> 01:03:49,110
- By the way, stock's going through the roof.
- What...?

1250
01:03:51,456 --> 01:03:53,036
Must be mindful of Joan's dog.

1251
01:03:53,083 --> 01:03:56,253
Who's... Who's Joan?

1252
01:03:57,087 --> 01:03:59,297
Thank you, darling.

1253
01:04:00,090 --> 01:04:03,220
You're never gonna make it
in a man's world dressed like that.

1254
01:04:03,260 --> 01:04:05,800
Mr. Peepers, you were almost
a Peepers pancake.

1255
01:04:05,846 --> 01:04:09,636
It's a round stage that has four
or five different sets that rotate...

1256
01:04:09,683 --> 01:04:12,483
depending on what we're selling
at a given moment.

1257
01:04:12,519 --> 01:04:13,939
The clasp is part of the necklace. See?

1258
01:04:13,979 --> 01:04:16,899
Look at the quality in this clasp.
That's what we do.

1259
01:04:16,940 --> 01:04:17,940
Absolutely exquisite.

1260
01:04:18,108 --> 01:04:21,318
Here comes Joan and Cindy.
Watch this.

1261
01:04:22,112 --> 01:04:23,202
These guys are major.

1262
01:04:23,614 --> 01:04:24,994
Joan's the original seller.

1263
01:04:25,032 --> 01:04:28,412
If you're just starting your jewelry wardrobe,
can you do anything better than this?

1264
01:04:28,452 --> 01:04:31,002
You're gonna mix in your blacks,
your golds, your pearls.

1265
01:04:31,038 --> 01:04:32,078
- Everything.
- Everything.

1266
01:04:32,122 --> 01:04:33,502
Look at it against the peach. Okay?

1267
01:04:33,540 --> 01:04:35,170
- Look at that.
- Morning.

1268
01:04:35,209 --> 01:04:36,789
- Look at that.
- Green. Afternoon.

1269
01:04:36,835 --> 01:04:38,415
- Look. Black, night.
- Black, evening.

1270
01:04:38,462 --> 01:04:40,802
- Of course at night.
- I mean, can you be more elegant?

1271
01:04:40,839 --> 01:04:43,129
So it's functional. Elegant.

1272
01:04:43,175 --> 01:04:45,845
You can wear it alone.
You can wear it... What I love...

1273
01:04:45,886 --> 01:04:48,096
See. Stars and people,
they always make the mistake.

1274
01:04:48,138 --> 01:04:50,138
They think it's about the face,
but it's not.

1275
01:04:50,182 --> 01:04:51,772
It's about the hands.

1276
01:04:51,808 --> 01:04:53,178
Because that's what people use.

1277
01:04:53,227 --> 01:04:55,017
They hold things they care about.

1278
01:04:55,062 --> 01:04:57,522
And her hands are gonna become
their hands.

1279
01:04:57,564 --> 01:04:58,944
And that becomes them.

1280
01:04:58,982 --> 01:05:01,442
And then their voice,
and then their eyes.

1281
01:05:01,485 --> 01:05:02,995
Stars always make the mistake.

1282
01:05:03,362 --> 01:05:06,492
It's really about the hands and the voice.
That's the heart of it.

1283
01:05:07,366 --> 01:05:09,576
Number J-6276.

1284
01:05:09,993 --> 01:05:11,333
A $100 value.

1285
01:05:11,370 --> 01:05:12,750
Are they not phenomenal?

1286
01:05:13,497 --> 01:05:15,287
- Now watch this.
- These can be yours.

1287
01:05:15,332 --> 01:05:17,962
- Cindy's gonna lay this down right...
- But you need to call in right now.

1288
01:05:18,001 --> 01:05:19,041
$39.99.

1289
01:05:19,753 --> 01:05:20,753
now!

1290
01:05:21,004 --> 01:05:23,054
You need this. You can get this.

1291
01:05:23,090 --> 01:05:24,670
You need to call right now, though.

1292
01:05:25,175 --> 01:05:27,635
- I'm being told we have limited quantity left.
- Watch the calls come in.

1293
01:05:27,678 --> 01:05:29,468
Watch them. Here they come.

1294
01:05:29,513 --> 01:05:32,023
For $39.99,
you might as well get several.

1295
01:05:32,057 --> 01:05:34,347
Calls coming in now.

1296
01:05:34,393 --> 01:05:36,193
Calls. Calls.

1297
01:05:36,228 --> 01:05:39,518
Calls. Calls. Calls. Calls.

1298
01:05:39,565 --> 01:05:41,735
Look at the count.
I guarantee we're gonna go over twenty.

1299
01:05:41,775 --> 01:05:43,565
Those are FTC standards.
Those are legal.

1300
01:05:43,610 --> 01:05:46,070
Those are coming in. Keep your eyes...
Those are actual sales, Joy.

1301
01:05:46,113 --> 01:05:47,493
Lines are busy?

1302
01:05:47,531 --> 01:05:49,031
- Is the queue full?
- Queue's full.

1303
01:05:49,741 --> 01:05:51,371
Okay. We need a phone call right now.

1304
01:05:51,410 --> 01:05:53,540
When they can't call through,
we gotta keep them watching.

1305
01:05:53,579 --> 01:05:55,209
Did we get a call? Did we get a call?

1306
01:05:55,247 --> 01:05:56,407
Okay. Got it.

1307
01:05:56,456 --> 01:05:57,866
Keep this going. Phone call right now.

1308
01:05:57,916 --> 01:05:59,996
Wait, wait, wait!
We have a caller! We have a caller!

1309
01:06:00,544 --> 01:06:02,554
Sharon from Colorado. Hi, Sharon.

1310
01:06:02,588 --> 01:06:03,508
Hi, Sharon.

1311
01:06:03,547 --> 01:06:05,877
Cindy and Joan!
I can't believe I'm talking to you!

1312
01:06:06,550 --> 01:06:08,430
Are you happy with your necklace?

1313
01:06:08,468 --> 01:06:13,008
These necklaces are so gorgeous
and timeless.

1314
01:06:13,056 --> 01:06:15,266
- My great-grandmother had things like this.
- Yes, yes. Keep it going.

1315
01:06:15,309 --> 01:06:18,309
I am so excited to have these.

1316
01:06:18,562 --> 01:06:21,902
Keep it going. Yes. Yes. Yes.

1317
01:06:21,940 --> 01:06:23,940
Get one for your mother.
Get one for your sister.

1318
01:06:23,984 --> 01:06:25,444
Watch the counter, Joy. Joy.

1319
01:06:25,485 --> 01:06:28,065
- You will not regret owning this.
- No, you will not.

1320
01:06:28,113 --> 01:06:29,413
See those numbers?

1321
01:06:29,448 --> 01:06:31,158
We're gonna wind up at 25,000.

1322
01:06:32,409 --> 01:06:33,909
Cindy knows how to close it.

1323
01:06:34,161 --> 01:06:35,161
Wow.

1324
01:06:36,121 --> 01:06:38,211
Okay, I want you to go home,
I want you to call your lawyer.

1325
01:06:38,248 --> 01:06:39,618
Look at your contract.

1326
01:06:39,666 --> 01:06:42,126
Make sure your product factory
is in line.

1327
01:06:43,420 --> 01:06:45,300
- Okay?
- Okay.

1328
01:06:45,339 --> 01:06:48,259
Okay, Godspeed, good luck.
Here we go. I'll walk you out.

1329
01:06:51,261 --> 01:06:56,021
You can't expect Trudy to write a check
for $200,000 for 50,000 mops...

1330
01:06:56,475 --> 01:07:00,355
when you already owe her $18,000
to make mops you haven't even sold yet.

1331
01:07:01,522 --> 01:07:08,072
Do you understand that there is a business
that wants to sell my mop on television?

1332
01:07:08,111 --> 01:07:09,781
It's going to sell.

1333
01:07:10,280 --> 01:07:13,990
Fine. You feel so strongly about it,
you put up half the money.

1334
01:07:14,284 --> 01:07:17,754
Yes. It's only fair that you share
the financial risk, too.

1335
01:07:17,788 --> 01:07:21,248
How's she gonna do that?
She's got nothing. She's got no money.

1336
01:07:23,252 --> 01:07:25,922
What, do you want me to take out
a second mortgage on my house?

1337
01:07:31,009 --> 01:07:33,429
They want me to take out
a second mortgage on my house.

1338
01:07:33,470 --> 01:07:35,060
A second mortgage?

1339
01:07:35,097 --> 01:07:36,557
But the house, the kids, Joy.

1340
01:07:36,598 --> 01:07:38,768
What's gonna happen, Joy?
How would you do that?

1341
01:07:38,809 --> 01:07:39,809
I don't know.

1342
01:07:54,616 --> 01:07:56,326
- Hey. How you doing?
- Hey.

1343
01:07:56,368 --> 01:07:58,948
You know I've been watching you through
that fence since you were a little girl?

1344
01:07:58,996 --> 01:08:00,456
- Yeah.
- I've been watching you grow up.

1345
01:08:00,497 --> 01:08:01,787
- Hey, listen.
- What?

1346
01:08:01,832 --> 01:08:03,922
You think it would be okay if I...

1347
01:08:03,959 --> 01:08:05,789
- You wanna fire a few rounds?
- I do.

1348
01:08:05,836 --> 01:08:06,956
Yeah. Might make you feel better.

1349
01:08:07,004 --> 01:08:08,134
Thank you. I think it will.

1350
01:08:08,172 --> 01:08:09,802
- You know how to hold it?
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

1351
01:08:09,840 --> 01:08:11,970
Okay. Sure.

1352
01:08:14,678 --> 01:08:15,678
Good.

1353
01:08:16,138 --> 01:08:17,138
Good.

1354
01:08:18,182 --> 01:08:19,182
Good.

1355
01:08:19,892 --> 01:08:20,892
Good.

1356
01:08:37,159 --> 01:08:39,829
This is it! Oh, my gosh.

1357
01:08:40,537 --> 01:08:43,787
Get ready. This is definitely
gonna change the holidays...

1358
01:08:43,832 --> 01:08:46,842
for anyone who has a floor
or a bathroom...

1359
01:08:46,877 --> 01:08:49,877
because we have the most exciting
new home product in years.

1360
01:08:50,172 --> 01:08:51,302
Yeah!

1361
01:08:51,340 --> 01:08:54,720
This is the new self-wringing mop.

1362
01:08:54,760 --> 01:08:55,890
Okay, okay, okay!

1363
01:08:55,928 --> 01:08:58,808
It's the new standard in homes,
right here.

1364
01:08:58,847 --> 01:09:01,977
Let's take a look at this.
This is brought to you only by QVC.

1365
01:09:02,017 --> 01:09:07,557
Now, this is clearly extremely
soft and absorbent cotton.

1366
01:09:08,357 --> 01:09:09,687
There we go.

1367
01:09:09,733 --> 01:09:13,033
You just take this, and you...

1368
01:09:13,570 --> 01:09:14,860
start...

1369
01:09:14,905 --> 01:09:17,245
I'm not sure.
This is a little trickier than it looks.

1370
01:09:18,617 --> 01:09:19,617
Put it...

1371
01:09:19,910 --> 01:09:22,410
Well, it's getting my arm wet, here.

1372
01:09:23,080 --> 01:09:25,250
Let's see. We got no sales here.

1373
01:09:25,916 --> 01:09:27,036
What happened?

1374
01:09:27,084 --> 01:09:28,294
Is there a call?

1375
01:09:30,045 --> 01:09:32,125
So there... So there are no calls.

1376
01:09:33,757 --> 01:09:34,757
All right.

1377
01:09:36,593 --> 01:09:41,513
And we do not have any sales still
so here's what we're gonna do.

1378
01:09:42,057 --> 01:09:44,267
We're gonna move on.
Now, we're gonna move on.

1379
01:09:44,309 --> 01:09:48,689
Cindy is gonna talk to Sarina Kimball,
former star from Falcon Crest and Dynasty...

1380
01:09:49,731 --> 01:09:54,071
and she is gonna tell us
all about her new line of gowns.

1381
01:09:55,279 --> 01:09:58,489
These are my special occasion gowns...

1382
01:09:58,949 --> 01:10:00,949
"Special." How apropos.

1383
01:10:00,993 --> 01:10:07,503
that were inspired by all of the times
that I was in Dynasty and Falcon Crest.

1384
01:10:07,958 --> 01:10:10,038
That is absolutely amazing.

1385
01:10:10,085 --> 01:10:12,375
I want you to pan in. Look at these.

1386
01:10:12,421 --> 01:10:14,421
- Look at the detail.
- Look at the detail.

1387
01:10:14,464 --> 01:10:16,264
Look at the value in that.

1388
01:10:16,300 --> 01:10:18,430
About how many sequins
would you say that is?

1389
01:10:18,468 --> 01:10:19,588
That's it?

1390
01:10:19,636 --> 01:10:20,756
- That's all?
- No, it's over.

1391
01:10:20,804 --> 01:10:22,144
That's how fast it happens.

1392
01:10:22,181 --> 01:10:23,471
No, they're gonna give her
a second chance.

1393
01:10:23,515 --> 01:10:25,305
No, they're not gonna give her
a second chance.

1394
01:10:25,350 --> 01:10:27,440
That's not what's gonna happen.

1395
01:10:27,477 --> 01:10:29,767
They're going to give her
a second chance.

1396
01:10:29,813 --> 01:10:31,773
- Why do you have to be so negative?
- They will.

1397
01:10:31,815 --> 01:10:33,645
$200,000!

1398
01:10:35,027 --> 01:10:36,317
50,000 mops.

1399
01:10:36,862 --> 01:10:40,372
Now, this is easily one of my favorites.

1400
01:10:40,407 --> 01:10:41,907
She's wearing the black and gold...

1401
01:11:09,019 --> 01:11:10,099
Joy.

1402
01:11:15,859 --> 01:11:16,939
Hello?

1403
01:11:19,112 --> 01:11:21,952
5,107 sequins for...

1404
01:11:22,366 --> 01:11:24,276
Get this. How much?

1405
01:11:24,326 --> 01:11:25,326
$299.

1406
01:11:29,206 --> 01:11:31,206
I'm sorry the product didn't sell.

1407
01:11:34,503 --> 01:11:37,303
That man didn't know
what he was doing, Neil.

1408
01:11:38,882 --> 01:11:42,222
Well, it wasn't the man, Joy.
It was the product.

1409
01:11:48,350 --> 01:11:51,730
I made 50,000 units
because you told me to.

1410
01:11:52,229 --> 01:11:56,399
I mortgaged my house,
I'm in $200,000 of debt. More.

1411
01:11:58,068 --> 01:12:00,778
Well, it's your business.
It's your debt.

1412
01:12:00,821 --> 01:12:03,911
And we indemnify up to a third,
if you read your contract.

1413
01:12:04,825 --> 01:12:07,415
To be honest,
that's even gonna be hard to get.

1414
01:12:09,329 --> 01:12:11,659
Neil, you gotta give us another chance.

1415
01:12:12,541 --> 01:12:13,881
I'm so sorry, Joy.

1416
01:12:13,917 --> 01:12:16,707
I just can't bring it to my boss.
I can't.

1417
01:12:19,590 --> 01:12:21,590
I can't accept your answer.

1418
01:12:22,926 --> 01:12:26,096
I can't, and I won't.

1419
01:12:27,931 --> 01:12:31,561
Joy, you have to let Trudy
report this loss in bankruptcy...

1420
01:12:31,602 --> 01:12:34,522
because otherwise she's gonna
hemorrhage even more money.

1421
01:12:34,563 --> 01:12:36,403
You have to file, too...

1422
01:12:36,440 --> 01:12:39,230
because you mortgaged your
children's future and you lost...

1423
01:12:39,276 --> 01:12:41,776
and you have to
prepare yourself for that.

1424
01:12:42,279 --> 01:12:43,739
You have to file for bankruptcy.

1425
01:12:43,780 --> 01:12:45,870
I warned you so many times, Joy!

1426
01:12:45,908 --> 01:12:47,528
Dad, I warned you
to not spend her money!

1427
01:12:47,576 --> 01:12:50,746
Come on! You've been plotting against her
from the very beginning, Peggy!

1428
01:12:50,787 --> 01:12:52,457
Now we're bankrupt, Tony!

1429
01:12:54,541 --> 01:12:56,211
I'm in a meeting with our lawyers.

1430
01:12:56,960 --> 01:12:58,250
What do you think you're doing?

1431
01:13:00,297 --> 01:13:05,297
"Go home, Joy, and watch the numbers
roll in on television."

1432
01:13:06,136 --> 01:13:08,716
"Make 50,000 mops..."

1433
01:13:08,764 --> 01:13:12,434
"borrowing and owing every dollar,
including your home."

1434
01:13:13,310 --> 01:13:14,730
It could have been handled better.

1435
01:13:14,770 --> 01:13:16,270
I'll let Todd have another shot.

1436
01:13:16,313 --> 01:13:19,443
I don't want Todd
or anyone else to try it.

1437
01:13:19,483 --> 01:13:21,283
It should be me.

1438
01:13:21,318 --> 01:13:22,608
We don't have regular people.

1439
01:13:22,653 --> 01:13:25,913
We have celebrities or spokesmodels
do the selling.

1440
01:13:25,948 --> 01:13:27,408
I told you this.

1441
01:13:28,283 --> 01:13:29,953
Who showed you the mop?

1442
01:13:29,993 --> 01:13:32,203
Who sold it to you?
Who taught you how to use it?

1443
01:13:32,246 --> 01:13:35,666
And who convinced you that it was great
after you thought it was worthless?

1444
01:13:40,671 --> 01:13:42,591
Excuse me, can you give us a second?

1445
01:13:43,757 --> 01:13:45,127
Come with me.

1446
01:13:55,143 --> 01:13:58,233
You ever been in front of a TV camera?
You comfortable in front of a TV camera?

1447
01:13:58,272 --> 01:14:02,152
Because when you get there, there's lights
and there's camera, and people freeze up.

1448
01:14:02,776 --> 01:14:05,816
You said to me that David Selznick,
the son of immigrants...

1449
01:14:05,863 --> 01:14:09,493
married Jennifer Jones,
an all-American girl from Oklahoma...

1450
01:14:09,533 --> 01:14:13,503
because in America,
all races and all classes...

1451
01:14:13,537 --> 01:14:16,827
can meet and make
whatever opportunities they can.

1452
01:14:16,874 --> 01:14:22,134
And that is what you feel when you reach
into people's homes with what you sell.

1453
01:14:26,383 --> 01:14:28,133
You said that.

1454
01:14:29,178 --> 01:14:31,848
What do you think? Looks great, right?

1455
01:14:33,557 --> 01:14:35,427
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Beautiful.

1456
01:14:35,475 --> 01:14:36,885
Very vogue, very classic.

1457
01:14:37,394 --> 01:14:40,024
All right, if you come back next time...
Lori? Lori?

1458
01:14:40,063 --> 01:14:45,153
I just want you to just put the hair a little bit forward,
just like that, if she comes back again.

1459
01:14:45,527 --> 01:14:47,817
Okay? Not with the comb,
not with the comb.

1460
01:14:47,863 --> 01:14:49,493
- Try the black.
- Okay.

1461
01:14:49,531 --> 01:14:50,781
Okay?

1462
01:14:50,824 --> 01:14:51,834
It's gonna be perfect.

1463
01:15:04,588 --> 01:15:05,588
Wow.

1464
01:15:09,176 --> 01:15:11,586
Beautiful. What do you think?
How do you feel?

1465
01:15:13,096 --> 01:15:15,716
I'd like to change just one thing.
Would you mind?

1466
01:15:16,099 --> 01:15:18,389
- Okay, surprise me.
- Small thing.

1467
01:15:18,435 --> 01:15:19,385
I'll surprise you.

1468
01:15:19,436 --> 01:15:20,596
Okay, surprise me.

1469
01:15:23,565 --> 01:15:26,435
What would the small thing be
that she changes?

1470
01:15:30,447 --> 01:15:31,447
What?

1471
01:15:31,949 --> 01:15:33,699
You undid the whole thing.

1472
01:15:34,785 --> 01:15:35,745
This is me.

1473
01:15:35,786 --> 01:15:37,036
This is you?

1474
01:15:37,079 --> 01:15:39,579
You've got the exact same outfit
you had when you came in here.

1475
01:15:39,623 --> 01:15:41,923
I wear a blouse and I wear pants.

1476
01:15:41,959 --> 01:15:43,629
That's who I am.

1477
01:15:44,086 --> 01:15:45,746
I want to go on as me.

1478
01:15:47,089 --> 01:15:48,419
Gonna go on as you.

1479
01:15:48,966 --> 01:15:50,626
I hope you make it back.

1480
01:15:51,426 --> 01:15:53,676
Joan, Cindy. Say good luck to Joy.

1481
01:15:53,720 --> 01:15:54,720
- Wow.
- Wow.

1482
01:15:54,763 --> 01:15:56,103
You look great. Good luck today.

1483
01:15:56,139 --> 01:15:57,269
- Thank you.
- Good luck.

1484
01:15:57,307 --> 01:15:58,597
That's her, that's how she is.

1485
01:15:58,642 --> 01:16:01,062
Blouse and... She should be in a skirt.
She's got nice long legs.

1486
01:16:01,103 --> 01:16:02,103
Show her legs.

1487
01:16:02,271 --> 01:16:03,441
Good luck.

1488
01:16:03,480 --> 01:16:06,690
Joan Rivers wants me in a skirt,
but I'm gonna do pants.

1489
01:16:06,733 --> 01:16:08,153
Do what you want to do.

1490
01:16:08,652 --> 01:16:10,072
Come on, let's go upstairs.

1491
01:16:19,955 --> 01:16:21,085
Are you nervous?

1492
01:16:21,123 --> 01:16:22,123
Yes.

1493
01:16:22,833 --> 01:16:24,213
Just be yourself.

1494
01:16:24,251 --> 01:16:25,851
Just remember, it's all about the hands.

1495
01:16:26,670 --> 01:16:27,840
Here we go.

1496
01:16:43,353 --> 01:16:46,363
Ready... Stage is moving!

1497
01:16:46,773 --> 01:16:51,033
Household product 375 in three, two...

1498
01:16:56,617 --> 01:16:59,037
What are you doing? Come on.

1499
01:16:59,328 --> 01:17:01,538
Go! Go!

1500
01:17:02,998 --> 01:17:04,538
She's freezing.

1501
01:17:06,460 --> 01:17:08,960
Sorry, these lights are so bright.

1502
01:17:11,340 --> 01:17:14,340
Nobody tells you how bright these lights...
Well, Neil did tell me.

1503
01:17:16,345 --> 01:17:19,395
Neil is my boss. Here.

1504
01:17:20,891 --> 01:17:23,391
I should thank him
for letting me be up here.

1505
01:17:24,728 --> 01:17:26,308
- Sorry.
- You're Joy.

1506
01:17:26,355 --> 01:17:27,485
I am Joy.

1507
01:17:27,523 --> 01:17:30,533
Just say something!
Talk about the mop!

1508
01:17:30,567 --> 01:17:31,687
Oh, my God.

1509
01:17:31,735 --> 01:17:32,895
We have to do something.

1510
01:17:34,071 --> 01:17:35,571
We have to do something.

1511
01:17:36,323 --> 01:17:37,703
Do we have a call?

1512
01:17:37,741 --> 01:17:38,871
- Could we go to a call?
- We have a call.

1513
01:17:38,909 --> 01:17:40,199
- It's a friendly call?
- It's a friendly call.

1514
01:17:40,244 --> 01:17:42,414
Okay. Take it. Take it.

1515
01:17:42,829 --> 01:17:44,039
Joy, we have a call.

1516
01:17:44,081 --> 01:17:46,211
A call? How did that happen?

1517
01:17:47,084 --> 01:17:48,594
Well, we have a call.

1518
01:17:48,877 --> 01:17:50,497
Hi. Joanne from New York.

1519
01:17:50,546 --> 01:17:51,666
Joanne from New York.

1520
01:17:51,713 --> 01:17:54,173
We have a call coming in
from Joanne from New York.

1521
01:17:54,424 --> 01:17:59,014
Yeah, I'm calling in because I would love a
mop that I don't have to touch when I wring it.

1522
01:17:59,054 --> 01:18:02,144
You know, my hands get raw
and when I mop broken glass...

1523
01:18:02,182 --> 01:18:04,932
and I wring the mop, I cut my hands.

1524
01:18:06,728 --> 01:18:09,188
Do you ever cut your hands
when you're wringing?

1525
01:18:09,231 --> 01:18:11,691
Joanne, that is so funny
that you said that.

1526
01:18:11,733 --> 01:18:16,243
That is actually exactly how
I was inspired to invent this mop.

1527
01:18:16,280 --> 01:18:21,490
There was glass shattered everywhere.
I was with my two kids, with my father, and I...

1528
01:18:21,535 --> 01:18:24,795
Every time I would wring the mop,
I would get glass shards in my hands.

1529
01:18:25,247 --> 01:18:28,417
And the old mop
just wasn't very absorbent.

1530
01:18:28,458 --> 01:18:33,668
So I went to my daughter's room,
and I borrowed her crayons...

1531
01:18:33,714 --> 01:18:36,304
and I designed this mop.

1532
01:18:36,925 --> 01:18:38,085
Make sure you get down there.
Yeah, that's it.

1533
01:18:38,468 --> 01:18:40,828
It's made of plastic, so it's lightweight,
but very durable.

1534
01:18:41,096 --> 01:18:42,506
Go in. Go in to the hands.

1535
01:18:42,556 --> 01:18:43,516
It's extremely absorbent...

1536
01:18:43,557 --> 01:18:46,097
with 300 continuous cotton loops...

1537
01:18:46,143 --> 01:18:48,483
that I looped myself
when I designed it.

1538
01:18:48,770 --> 01:18:51,770
- How much is it?
- It is $19.95.

1539
01:18:52,316 --> 01:18:54,316
I like that price.
I want a whole bunch of them.

1540
01:18:55,068 --> 01:18:56,318
Thank you.

1541
01:18:56,570 --> 01:18:58,530
H375. That's the order number.

1542
01:18:58,572 --> 01:19:00,782
Household item 375.

1543
01:19:00,824 --> 01:19:01,954
I guarantee you...

1544
01:19:01,992 --> 01:19:03,282
That's it. Stay right there.

1545
01:19:03,327 --> 01:19:05,537
you are not going to find
another mop like this that exists.

1546
01:19:05,579 --> 01:19:08,919
If there was, I would have bought it
and I wouldn't have cut my hands up.

1547
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:13,920
You can get across the whole kitchen
with one wring. Just imagine that.

1548
01:19:13,962 --> 01:19:15,302
Watch this.

1549
01:19:16,465 --> 01:19:17,925
Chocolate syrup.

1550
01:19:20,093 --> 01:19:21,393
Go the syrup. Go the syrup.

1551
01:19:21,428 --> 01:19:24,138
Baby food.
A very big spill at my house.

1552
01:19:24,181 --> 01:19:25,561
Very common spill for me.

1553
01:19:25,599 --> 01:19:27,179
No. Hands, hands.

1554
01:19:27,809 --> 01:19:31,729
Now, the biggest difference,
I don't have to touch this disgusting mop head.

1555
01:19:31,772 --> 01:19:33,772
There's not another mop on the market...

1556
01:19:33,815 --> 01:19:38,485
that has as much absorbent cotton
as this mop right here.

1557
01:19:38,529 --> 01:19:42,449
And I guarantee you,
there will be no regrets, no returns.

1558
01:19:42,491 --> 01:19:45,661
I have been mopping for most of my life,
every single day.

1559
01:19:45,702 --> 01:19:46,832
Phones are ringing!

1560
01:19:46,870 --> 01:19:49,120
I cannot tell you how much
this mop has changed my life.

1561
01:19:49,164 --> 01:19:51,124
- Phones are ringing! Phones are ringing!
- The phones are ringing. The phones are ringing.

1562
01:19:51,375 --> 01:19:52,045
Go.

1563
01:19:52,292 --> 01:19:55,422
This is gonna be the greatest mop
to have around Christmas time...

1564
01:19:55,462 --> 01:19:57,462
when you have family over...

1565
01:19:57,506 --> 01:20:01,586
I am a mother of two.
There is just spill after spill.

1566
01:20:01,635 --> 01:20:03,435
Family comes to town.

1567
01:20:03,470 --> 01:20:05,890
You can mop your entire kitchen
with one wring!

1568
01:20:06,139 --> 01:20:08,889
Oh, my God! 29,000!

1569
01:20:09,142 --> 01:20:10,772
This is very special!

1570
01:20:10,811 --> 01:20:13,521
I haven't even told you about
my personal favorite feature...

1571
01:20:13,564 --> 01:20:15,694
which is the removable mop head...

1572
01:20:15,732 --> 01:20:20,702
that I can put into the washing machine
and it will come out clean as new.

1573
01:20:20,737 --> 01:20:22,237
Yes! Yes!

1574
01:20:22,281 --> 01:20:24,621
Oh, my God, these numbers keep climbing!

1575
01:20:25,576 --> 01:20:26,866
Thank you. I...

1576
01:20:26,910 --> 01:20:28,240
Yes, that's right. Keep it going.

1577
01:20:28,287 --> 01:20:29,287
Thank you.

1578
01:20:30,622 --> 01:20:33,582
This is the most absorbent
mop on the market. It's lightweight.

1579
01:20:33,625 --> 01:20:37,045
It's the only mop that you're ever gonna buy,
the best mop you're ever gonna use.

1580
01:20:37,087 --> 01:20:41,507
It is lightweight and durable, and that is
just me speaking from my experience.

1581
01:20:41,550 --> 01:20:45,600
As someone who mops their house
every single day, from my heart.

1582
01:20:46,930 --> 01:20:50,100
This woman's gonna be
a whole new business.

1583
01:20:51,977 --> 01:20:52,977
No way.

1584
01:20:58,400 --> 01:20:59,730
Oh, my God.

1585
01:21:19,922 --> 01:21:23,432
Can you believe it?
Can you believe it?

1586
01:21:23,467 --> 01:21:26,967
I thought for sure you were gonna tell me
that your counting machine was broken.

1587
01:21:27,012 --> 01:21:28,812
I listened to you. You were right.

1588
01:21:28,847 --> 01:21:31,467
I just can't believe
that actually happened.

1589
01:21:31,517 --> 01:21:32,637
I know.

1590
01:21:32,684 --> 01:21:35,234
I guess you could say
we're friends in commerce.

1591
01:21:35,270 --> 01:21:36,440
Friends in commerce.

1592
01:21:36,480 --> 01:21:37,440
Yeah.

1593
01:21:37,481 --> 01:21:41,111
Let's promise each other that if, one day,
and that day may come...

1594
01:21:41,151 --> 01:21:44,611
that we become adversaries in commerce,
that we remain friends.

1595
01:21:44,655 --> 01:21:46,415
Because that's a true friendship indeed.

1596
01:21:46,448 --> 01:21:47,698
Friends in commerce.

1597
01:21:48,325 --> 01:21:50,335
I agree. Let's shake on it.

1598
01:22:31,076 --> 01:22:33,036
We've got 10 looms...

1599
01:22:33,078 --> 01:22:36,618
and then when they're completed,
this is where the mop heads are sewn.

1600
01:22:38,834 --> 01:22:40,174
Who makes your parts?

1601
01:22:40,669 --> 01:22:42,499
A factory out in California.

1602
01:22:42,546 --> 01:22:45,336
It was cheaper and faster
than any place around here.

1603
01:22:45,382 --> 01:22:47,722
Smart. Are they gonna be able
to stay on schedule?

1604
01:22:49,178 --> 01:22:50,178
Yeah.

1605
01:22:57,227 --> 01:22:58,437
One time.

1606
01:23:18,123 --> 01:23:19,253
- Right there.
- Thank you.

1607
01:23:19,291 --> 01:23:20,491
- You're welcome.
- Right here?

1608
01:23:22,252 --> 01:23:23,252
Hello?

1609
01:24:24,314 --> 01:24:25,444
Mimi.

1610
01:24:28,277 --> 01:24:29,357
Mimi.

1611
01:24:44,626 --> 01:24:46,996
I so hated to leave her that day.

1612
01:24:48,172 --> 01:24:50,762
I had so much I wanted to say to her.

1613
01:24:51,675 --> 01:24:53,715
And to my great granddaughter.

1614
01:24:56,471 --> 01:25:01,561
I felt I wanted to stay near her
and watch over her.

1615
01:26:07,668 --> 01:26:09,288
Cristy.

1616
01:26:15,384 --> 01:26:17,344
There's a problem in California.

1617
01:26:17,386 --> 01:26:21,636
There can't be a problem in California.
I told Neil that everything was fine.

1618
01:26:21,682 --> 01:26:24,812
Gerhardt keeps raising his price.
He just did it again.

1619
01:26:24,852 --> 01:26:25,852
More money per unit.

1620
01:26:27,229 --> 01:26:29,309
He can't do that.
We're gonna lose money.

1621
01:26:29,356 --> 01:26:31,476
I sent a representative to handle him.

1622
01:26:32,693 --> 01:26:34,653
Representative?
We don't have a representative.

1623
01:26:34,695 --> 01:26:36,245
What representative?

1624
01:26:36,780 --> 01:26:37,990
Peggy went.

1625
01:26:38,282 --> 01:26:39,412
Peggy?

1626
01:26:43,871 --> 01:26:45,831
I don't want to talk about this
right now.

1627
01:26:54,798 --> 01:26:56,168
She wanted to be part of it.

1628
01:26:56,216 --> 01:26:58,216
How could you send Peggy?

1629
01:27:02,931 --> 01:27:04,891
She wanted to be part of it.

1630
01:27:05,726 --> 01:27:09,936
You both are blood relatives.
You're half-sisters.

1631
01:27:09,980 --> 01:27:13,730
It's very, very important
that you love and respect each other.

1632
01:27:16,236 --> 01:27:20,526
I paid them the 20
that you owed them. I had to.

1633
01:27:22,284 --> 01:27:25,914
I got them to fill the order
of the 100,000...

1634
01:27:25,954 --> 01:27:28,584
with a price increase
of only two dollars per unit.

1635
01:27:28,624 --> 01:27:33,214
We can't increase at all, Peggy.
Don't you understand?

1636
01:27:35,464 --> 01:27:38,174
We sold at a certain price.

1637
01:27:39,009 --> 01:27:42,759
Any hikes,
especially the ones he's asking for...

1638
01:27:42,804 --> 01:27:44,814
mean that I will lose so much money...

1639
01:27:44,848 --> 01:27:49,098
that I'll be in even more debt
than I was before.

1640
01:27:51,146 --> 01:27:52,766
You're gonna make it back.

1641
01:27:53,607 --> 01:27:55,727
I'm gonna make it back?

1642
01:27:56,568 --> 01:27:57,568
How?

1643
01:28:02,741 --> 01:28:04,831
I've got ideas, you know.

1644
01:28:06,828 --> 01:28:09,248
There are things that I'd like to do.

1645
01:28:09,289 --> 01:28:13,079
I spoke to him about a project
that Dad and I have been designing.

1646
01:28:13,126 --> 01:28:14,416
Right, Dad?

1647
01:28:14,461 --> 01:28:15,921
Yes, we did.

1648
01:28:18,048 --> 01:28:22,838
Do you have any idea
how much your idea will cost?

1649
01:28:22,886 --> 01:28:24,966
How or where you'll sell it?

1650
01:28:25,639 --> 01:28:28,929
If you can even manufacture it
after it's taken everything we've got...

1651
01:28:28,976 --> 01:28:32,596
to sell this one product that now,
thanks to you...

1652
01:28:32,646 --> 01:28:34,646
is going to cost more money?

1653
01:28:35,274 --> 01:28:38,114
Maybe my product
is better than your product.

1654
01:28:38,151 --> 01:28:40,701
I can do what you did on TV.
It's not that hard.

1655
01:28:40,737 --> 01:28:44,317
Isn't that the whole purpose of that channel?
It's that everybody could do it?

1656
01:28:45,534 --> 01:28:50,504
What your sister does is not easy...

1657
01:28:50,539 --> 01:28:54,499
but what we were planning to do...

1658
01:28:54,543 --> 01:28:58,213
is not that difficult.

1659
01:28:59,214 --> 01:29:00,974
Listen to me.

1660
01:29:01,925 --> 01:29:07,385
Never speak on my behalf...

1661
01:29:10,100 --> 01:29:13,480
about my business again.

1662
01:29:15,439 --> 01:29:18,109
Now I have to go to California.

1663
01:30:19,253 --> 01:30:20,553
Can I help you?

1664
01:30:20,587 --> 01:30:22,587
I'm Joy. I'm here to see Gerhardt.

1665
01:30:23,298 --> 01:30:24,758
He's not available.

1666
01:30:25,968 --> 01:30:27,138
I'll wait.

1667
01:30:30,597 --> 01:30:32,887
She says she's here to see Gerhardt.

1668
01:30:33,851 --> 01:30:34,851
Gerhardt!

1669
01:30:42,693 --> 01:30:44,783
Hey. I'm Gerhardt.

1670
01:30:44,820 --> 01:30:46,320
I'm Joy.

1671
01:30:46,363 --> 01:30:47,743
Come on in.

1672
01:30:47,781 --> 01:30:49,201
Derek Markham is my boss.

1673
01:30:49,241 --> 01:30:50,491
He lives in Texas.

1674
01:30:50,534 --> 01:30:54,914
Fabri-Pac is one of several companies
he owns or collects royalties for.

1675
01:30:54,955 --> 01:30:58,465
I report to him.
He makes pricing decisions.

1676
01:30:58,500 --> 01:31:01,590
Well, I've never met or talked
to this Derek Markham...

1677
01:31:01,628 --> 01:31:03,418
but I've talked to you many times
on the phone.

1678
01:31:03,463 --> 01:31:05,013
And I do find it very curious...

1679
01:31:05,048 --> 01:31:08,128
that the second I'm on television,
with a lot of success...

1680
01:31:08,177 --> 01:31:10,597
the price for our products goes up.

1681
01:31:10,637 --> 01:31:13,307
Seems very unfair to me,
to say the least.

1682
01:31:14,016 --> 01:31:16,386
Seems like you're shaking us down.

1683
01:31:16,435 --> 01:31:18,855
You met Gregory, our plant foreman.

1684
01:31:18,896 --> 01:31:21,186
It's very hard for us to lower the cost
at this point.

1685
01:31:21,690 --> 01:31:23,980
We're already losing a lot of money.

1686
01:31:24,026 --> 01:31:27,196
How could that possibly be,
with the $500,000 that we've given you...

1687
01:31:27,237 --> 01:31:29,527
on top of the
$50,000 of advance royalties...

1688
01:31:29,573 --> 01:31:32,833
that have gone to a Derek Markham
in Dallas.

1689
01:31:32,868 --> 01:31:35,118
And that's not even counting
what my sister paid you...

1690
01:31:35,162 --> 01:31:36,832
without my authority, by the way...

1691
01:31:36,872 --> 01:31:39,582
for your overcharges and your mistakes.

1692
01:31:40,334 --> 01:31:43,924
Your sister paid the increase
that you refused to pay.

1693
01:31:44,254 --> 01:31:48,094
Well, she had no authority to do that.
She's not an officer of my corporation.

1694
01:31:49,092 --> 01:31:53,602
You and I could both spend a lot of time
and money in court to prove that I'm right...

1695
01:31:54,765 --> 01:31:56,525
but that would just make
our lawyers wealthy...

1696
01:31:56,558 --> 01:31:59,098
while my product dies
instead of being on television...

1697
01:31:59,144 --> 01:32:00,944
like it could be right now.

1698
01:32:02,022 --> 01:32:03,652
You can pay more.

1699
01:32:04,149 --> 01:32:06,899
I can't pay more. I won't.

1700
01:32:06,944 --> 01:32:09,864
Costs are higher.
Wear and tear on the molds.

1701
01:32:09,905 --> 01:32:11,995
We have to remake them every other week.

1702
01:32:12,032 --> 01:32:14,992
Is that so? Can I see the molds?

1703
01:32:15,035 --> 01:32:16,575
They're in the machines.

1704
01:32:16,620 --> 01:32:19,460
It'll take some time
to prepare them for you.

1705
01:32:24,378 --> 01:32:26,378
Is there a bathroom I could use?

1706
01:32:29,591 --> 01:32:31,891
Yeah, it's down the hall.
Gregory will show you.

1707
01:32:40,102 --> 01:32:41,192
Thanks.

1708
01:34:02,184 --> 01:34:03,314
What?

1709
01:34:07,147 --> 01:34:08,687
What are you doing in here?

1710
01:34:09,316 --> 01:34:10,726
What is this?

1711
01:34:10,776 --> 01:34:13,776
These are my designs,
these are my molds!

1712
01:34:13,820 --> 01:34:14,950
Those are ours!

1713
01:34:14,988 --> 01:34:17,068
And we knew you'd be trouble.
The cops are on their way.

1714
01:34:17,115 --> 01:34:19,365
- We called 'em as soon as you showed up!
- These are my molds!

1715
01:34:19,409 --> 01:34:20,619
Those are ours!

1716
01:34:20,661 --> 01:34:22,541
I'm taking these with me.

1717
01:34:22,788 --> 01:34:24,118
I'm taking all of these with me.

1718
01:34:24,164 --> 01:34:26,584
I want all of these boxed up,
and I'm taking them.

1719
01:34:26,625 --> 01:34:27,885
You're trespassing!

1720
01:34:27,918 --> 01:34:29,168
It's not your patent!

1721
01:34:29,586 --> 01:34:31,496
These are my designs!

1722
01:34:32,840 --> 01:34:35,180
I'm not going anywhere without my molds.

1723
01:34:36,093 --> 01:34:37,803
What? No. No.

1724
01:34:37,845 --> 01:34:40,265
This is not stealing,
this is my property!

1725
01:34:40,305 --> 01:34:41,555
This is my property.

1726
01:34:41,598 --> 01:34:45,058
I have all of these designs.
These are all mine. They belong to me!

1727
01:34:45,102 --> 01:34:48,862
She's from out of state, John!
You've known me 15 years!

1728
01:34:48,897 --> 01:34:50,647
All right, come on, ma'am.
You're trespassing.

1729
01:34:50,691 --> 01:34:52,401
- What?
- Yeah. Come on.

1730
01:34:52,442 --> 01:34:53,942
- I'm not trespassing.
- Yeah, you're trespassing.

1731
01:34:53,986 --> 01:34:55,106
I was in his office.

1732
01:34:55,153 --> 01:34:56,653
- You don't know. Come on.
- He let me into his...

1733
01:34:56,697 --> 01:34:58,197
Gerhardt, you're not gonna
get away with this.

1734
01:34:58,240 --> 01:34:59,780
- You're not gonna get away with this!
- Be careful what you're saying.

1735
01:34:59,825 --> 01:35:01,875
- You're a thief! You're a thief, Gerhardt!
- Be careful, come on, come on.

1736
01:35:01,910 --> 01:35:03,240
Be careful. Come on, stop it.

1737
01:35:03,287 --> 01:35:05,497
- This is stealing!
- Hey, hey, stop it. Come on.

1738
01:35:05,539 --> 01:35:06,539
All right.

1739
01:35:09,626 --> 01:35:11,586
Watch your step. All right.

1740
01:35:19,636 --> 01:35:21,006
What about Trudy's money, Joy?

1741
01:35:21,054 --> 01:35:23,184
You have to pay back Trudy's money.

1742
01:35:23,223 --> 01:35:24,893
This is only getting worse.

1743
01:35:24,933 --> 01:35:26,813
I predicted tragedy, Joy.

1744
01:35:27,269 --> 01:35:29,309
You're racking up quite a steep bill.

1745
01:35:29,354 --> 01:35:32,614
We had to fly out here, bail you out.

1746
01:35:32,649 --> 01:35:35,779
Plus it cost us an extra $10,000
for Ray Cagney...

1747
01:35:35,819 --> 01:35:38,319
this California patent attorney,
to get us to this point.

1748
01:35:38,363 --> 01:35:40,993
We got the state to decline prosecution.

1749
01:35:41,033 --> 01:35:43,243
They see it's a contract dispute.

1750
01:35:43,285 --> 01:35:46,915
When you paid royalties
to Derek Markham in Texas...

1751
01:35:46,955 --> 01:35:50,995
it put all your parts and molds
under the umbrella of their patent.

1752
01:35:51,919 --> 01:35:55,169
I see you brought your drawings
and hung them to prove your design.

1753
01:35:55,214 --> 01:35:57,844
But it's impossible to fight it now.

1754
01:35:57,883 --> 01:36:00,343
You were not properly advised.

1755
01:36:01,678 --> 01:36:03,178
Cristy, please!

1756
01:36:03,222 --> 01:36:04,352
Tony, take her to bed.

1757
01:36:04,389 --> 01:36:06,639
I don't wanna go to bed.
I wanna stay here.

1758
01:36:06,683 --> 01:36:08,183
I paid those royalties...

1759
01:36:08,227 --> 01:36:09,347
because you told me to.

1760
01:36:09,394 --> 01:36:12,234
Because your lawyer told me to.

1761
01:36:12,272 --> 01:36:16,152
Our lawyer was mistaken.
This happens sometimes in business.

1762
01:36:16,193 --> 01:36:17,533
It didn't work out for you.

1763
01:36:17,569 --> 01:36:18,739
It happens sometimes.

1764
01:36:18,779 --> 01:36:20,239
Trudy's lawyer is not a patent attorney.

1765
01:36:20,280 --> 01:36:21,740
Which I said!

1766
01:36:21,782 --> 01:36:25,872
And you said I had no business
being Joy's advisor.

1767
01:36:25,911 --> 01:36:27,791
- And now it turns out that I was right!
- This is not helpful, Tony!

1768
01:36:27,829 --> 01:36:29,869
- That's enough, Tony. Please.
- It's enough, now?

1769
01:36:29,915 --> 01:36:32,675
I'm very sorry.
I wish there was more I could do.

1770
01:36:32,709 --> 01:36:35,919
But when your sister Peggy paid
the unjustified bills...

1771
01:36:35,963 --> 01:36:37,803
that you refused to pay...

1772
01:36:37,840 --> 01:36:39,420
it closed the door on that.

1773
01:36:39,466 --> 01:36:41,296
What about Neil Walker and QVC?

1774
01:36:41,343 --> 01:36:43,853
Wouldn't they pay the expenses
on defending the patent?

1775
01:36:44,596 --> 01:36:45,716
Be careful, Joy.

1776
01:36:45,764 --> 01:36:49,524
You could be sued for misrepresentation
and failure to deliver your product.

1777
01:36:49,560 --> 01:36:50,560
That's breach.

1778
01:36:51,520 --> 01:36:54,900
QVC requires that you deliver
a fully patented product.

1779
01:36:54,940 --> 01:36:57,440
I've been doing this for a long time.

1780
01:36:57,484 --> 01:37:01,574
You're in for a long court process
that will stall your product.

1781
01:37:01,613 --> 01:37:03,203
And you will probably lose.

1782
01:37:03,240 --> 01:37:04,660
I wish I could do more.

1783
01:37:06,285 --> 01:37:07,835
Take care, now.

1784
01:37:07,870 --> 01:37:10,210
You're gonna have to accept
the facts, Joy.

1785
01:37:10,247 --> 01:37:11,707
I mean, that's...

1786
01:37:12,332 --> 01:37:14,422
You're most of half a million dollars
in debt.

1787
01:37:14,459 --> 01:37:16,289
I don't know how you're gonna pay it.

1788
01:37:16,628 --> 01:37:18,418
We have to declare bankruptcy.

1789
01:37:18,463 --> 01:37:20,883
You're gonna have to declare bankruptcy.

1790
01:37:21,258 --> 01:37:22,548
I have to declare bankruptcy.

1791
01:37:22,593 --> 01:37:23,723
She has to.

1792
01:37:23,760 --> 01:37:25,300
- To try to contain my losses.
- Yeah.

1793
01:37:25,345 --> 01:37:26,635
I have to write it off.

1794
01:37:26,680 --> 01:37:28,720
It just seems so wrong.

1795
01:37:28,765 --> 01:37:30,425
We've worked so hard.

1796
01:37:30,475 --> 01:37:32,685
We've come so far
for us to just give up now.

1797
01:37:32,728 --> 01:37:34,308
It just seems so unfair!

1798
01:37:34,354 --> 01:37:36,984
Business is unfair. That's it.

1799
01:37:37,024 --> 01:37:39,154
It's not working out.
Well, that's what happens.

1800
01:37:39,193 --> 01:37:43,033
That's why people don't go around
making invention every other day.

1801
01:37:43,071 --> 01:37:44,161
Wake up!

1802
01:37:44,198 --> 01:37:45,318
It's my fault.

1803
01:37:45,365 --> 01:37:48,275
I gave her the confidence to think she was
more than just an unemployed housewife...

1804
01:37:48,327 --> 01:37:51,157
selling plastic kitchen stuff
to other unemployed housewives...

1805
01:37:51,205 --> 01:37:52,415
on a junk cable channel.

1806
01:37:52,456 --> 01:37:55,286
It's my fault.
It's not your fault, honey.

1807
01:37:55,334 --> 01:37:57,974
It was my mistake to make her think
that she was more than she was.

1808
01:37:58,378 --> 01:38:00,958
She pressured herself into doing
something she shouldn't have done.

1809
01:38:01,006 --> 01:38:03,166
It was wrong of you
to put that pressure on yourself.

1810
01:38:03,217 --> 01:38:05,547
It was wrong of us
to put that pressure on you.

1811
01:38:05,594 --> 01:38:07,184
I need more vodka.

1812
01:38:07,221 --> 01:38:12,981
It was wrong of us to think that you'd be
an instant business person overnight.

1813
01:38:13,018 --> 01:38:15,558
Of course, this is not who you are.

1814
01:38:16,522 --> 01:38:21,612
It takes a kind of toughness,
a certain acumen...

1815
01:38:21,652 --> 01:38:24,452
that you simply don't have.

1816
01:38:25,113 --> 01:38:26,453
Sign the paper.

1817
01:38:30,994 --> 01:38:33,584
You have to sign
these bankruptcy papers, honey.

1818
01:38:33,622 --> 01:38:36,172
The notary's right outside.
Let me get her.

1819
01:38:40,170 --> 01:38:42,370
You're gonna have to move
out of your house immediately.

1820
01:38:43,173 --> 01:38:44,893
You're gonna have to move
into an apartment.

1821
01:38:45,342 --> 01:38:47,552
Maybe you can move into a room
in Trudy's house.

1822
01:38:47,594 --> 01:38:48,854
With the children?

1823
01:38:48,887 --> 01:38:50,257
Yeah. You have room.

1824
01:38:51,181 --> 01:38:52,601
She's my daughter. Why not?

1825
01:38:53,934 --> 01:38:55,524
Let's talk about it.

1826
01:38:56,019 --> 01:38:57,649
Trudy, we have to offer her something.

1827
01:38:57,688 --> 01:38:58,808
Again?

1828
01:38:58,856 --> 01:39:00,066
Why me?

1829
01:39:07,865 --> 01:39:09,455
Please sign, honey.

1830
01:39:35,767 --> 01:39:36,887
Thank you.

1831
01:39:40,647 --> 01:39:45,067
Mimi said you were the one born
to help carry the family to success.

1832
01:39:48,572 --> 01:39:51,412
No, Cristy. Mimi was wrong.

1833
01:39:52,826 --> 01:39:55,196
The world does not give you opportunities.

1834
01:39:55,245 --> 01:39:59,995
The world destroys your opportunity
and it breaks your heart.

1835
01:40:00,626 --> 01:40:04,376
I should have listened to my mother
when I was 10 years old.

1836
01:40:04,421 --> 01:40:06,101
I should have spent the rest of my life...

1837
01:40:06,131 --> 01:40:09,181
watching TV and hiding from the world
like my mother.

1838
01:40:10,093 --> 01:40:12,683
So I don't wanna hear
any more about Mimi.

1839
01:40:13,263 --> 01:40:14,433
She was wrong.

1840
01:40:14,473 --> 01:40:18,063
She had her head in the clouds
and it was full of stupid ideas.

1841
01:40:18,101 --> 01:40:20,271
And it gave me stupid ideas.

1842
01:40:22,814 --> 01:40:23,824
Like this.

1843
01:40:26,652 --> 01:40:28,822
This stupid, stupid idea!

1844
01:40:31,782 --> 01:40:34,332
Mommy, don't tear them! No!

1845
01:40:56,056 --> 01:40:58,346
Cristy, I'm so sorry.

1846
01:40:58,392 --> 01:41:00,602
I'm sorry, Cristy.

1847
01:41:00,644 --> 01:41:02,314
I'm so sorry.

1848
01:41:02,354 --> 01:41:04,814
Please go to bed.
Everybody just go to bed.

1849
01:41:06,191 --> 01:41:07,941
Good night, Mommy.

1850
01:41:07,985 --> 01:41:10,155
Good night, sweetheart. Just go to bed.

1851
01:41:12,739 --> 01:41:15,239
I'm so sorry I failed you, Joy.
I'm so sorry.

1852
01:41:15,492 --> 01:41:17,082
Just, just don't.

1853
01:42:48,752 --> 01:42:50,962
Joy? Joy?

1854
01:42:51,630 --> 01:42:53,050
Joy, where are you?

1855
01:42:55,050 --> 01:42:56,800
Joy, where are you?

1856
01:44:10,501 --> 01:44:11,791
It's open.

1857
01:44:19,551 --> 01:44:20,891
You can leave the door open.

1858
01:44:46,870 --> 01:44:48,870
No one knows I'm here.

1859
01:44:49,873 --> 01:44:52,003
You don't even know who I am.

1860
01:44:52,042 --> 01:44:57,552
I could be Derek Markham or I might be
someone Derek Markham sent to handle you.

1861
01:44:58,048 --> 01:45:00,048
You have no case.

1862
01:45:00,551 --> 01:45:04,551
Maybe people think you came to Dallas
in despair to take your own life...

1863
01:45:04,596 --> 01:45:09,556
because you were in such deep financial
trouble suddenly from your little venture.

1864
01:45:16,233 --> 01:45:19,533
I made a phone call this morning
to Hong Kong.

1865
01:45:20,195 --> 01:45:25,365
It was 1:00 a.m. in California but it was 5:00 p.m.
the following afternoon in Hong Kong.

1866
01:45:25,409 --> 01:45:29,749
I always think it's amazing
how time works like that.

1867
01:45:31,456 --> 01:45:34,706
And I was fortunate enough to get
on the phone with Mr. Christopher...

1868
01:45:34,751 --> 01:45:37,921
who I found to be very friendly,
which was surprising...

1869
01:45:37,963 --> 01:45:41,223
because I really haven't found the
gentlemen in California to be very nice...

1870
01:45:41,258 --> 01:45:43,758
considering we're all
in business together.

1871
01:45:43,802 --> 01:45:47,602
Welcome to the world of business,
I guess.

1872
01:45:48,640 --> 01:45:51,060
I told Mr. Christopher
that the reason that I was calling...

1873
01:45:51,101 --> 01:45:55,111
was to discuss the differences
in the designs of our products.

1874
01:45:55,772 --> 01:46:00,242
But I quickly learned
that Mr. Christopher has no idea...

1875
01:46:00,277 --> 01:46:06,447
if his Hong Kong patent for a self-wringing
mop is worth anything or if it even works.

1876
01:46:07,075 --> 01:46:12,115
Because they have not made
or sold a single mop.

1877
01:46:12,414 --> 01:46:16,134
Unlike us, who have sold over 200,000.

1878
01:46:17,252 --> 01:46:22,132
And I've paid you over $50,000
in advanced royalties...

1879
01:46:22,174 --> 01:46:24,134
on behalf of Mr. Christopher.

1880
01:46:24,676 --> 01:46:29,596
Blood money from my family
and my second mortgage.

1881
01:46:30,849 --> 01:46:35,309
Turns out Mr. Christopher doesn't know
anything about those royalties.

1882
01:46:35,354 --> 01:46:36,814
So it seems...

1883
01:46:37,981 --> 01:46:41,611
we have a case of fraud and embezzlement.

1884
01:46:44,655 --> 01:46:47,825
And, as if that weren't bad enough...

1885
01:46:48,700 --> 01:46:54,330
I also discovered in the paperwork that
our mops actually don't bear any similarities.

1886
01:46:54,373 --> 01:46:57,503
So I never did owe you
any royalties for your patent.

1887
01:46:58,544 --> 01:47:00,504
That's another case of fraud.

1888
01:47:01,171 --> 01:47:07,181
My lawyers really could go after you,
but I told them, "Give me a day."

1889
01:47:07,219 --> 01:47:13,179
To see if maybe
you might've made a mistake...

1890
01:47:15,018 --> 01:47:17,978
that you would correct,
given the chance.

1891
01:47:33,370 --> 01:47:36,370
We'll pay you back all the royalties
you paid us.

1892
01:47:41,420 --> 01:47:46,050
I'll give you $20,000
on top of paying you back the 50.

1893
01:47:58,020 --> 01:47:59,230
Okay.

1894
01:48:00,939 --> 01:48:04,689
I'll give you $50,000
on top of paying you back the 50.

1895
01:48:16,747 --> 01:48:18,367
Plus interest.

1896
01:48:23,795 --> 01:48:25,795
I want all of my molds back.

1897
01:48:26,465 --> 01:48:28,765
I want you to sign
this piece of paper...

1898
01:48:29,801 --> 01:48:33,101
saying that you have
no rights, financially.

1899
01:48:34,097 --> 01:48:37,597
I'm just gonna add...
I said the 50...

1900
01:48:39,728 --> 01:48:41,648
plus the 50...

1901
01:48:43,440 --> 01:48:46,230
plus the interest.

1902
01:48:46,276 --> 01:48:50,406
So I just want you to initial
next to those two numbers as well.

1903
01:48:56,453 --> 01:48:57,953
So just sign there.

1904
01:49:05,963 --> 01:49:08,473
She put up with just about anything.

1905
01:49:09,466 --> 01:49:11,926
Until when she had to
bring the hammer down...

1906
01:49:13,470 --> 01:49:15,140
she brought the hammer down.

1907
01:49:17,474 --> 01:49:20,144
She couldn't know what was to come.

1908
01:49:21,019 --> 01:49:25,109
That she'd go on to make
another 100 record-setting patents.

1909
01:49:26,024 --> 01:49:29,744
Skinny velvet hangers
make neater closets.

1910
01:49:29,778 --> 01:49:32,108
That's a big deal to a lot of people.

1911
01:49:33,282 --> 01:49:35,702
I mean, who thinks of things like that?

1912
01:49:36,869 --> 01:49:38,159
Joy did.

1913
01:49:42,457 --> 01:49:47,667
She didn't know any of this would happen
as she walked down the street that day.

1914
01:49:48,338 --> 01:49:52,468
Yes, sir, tonight's the night for
Ol' Saint Nick to make his yearly visit...

1915
01:49:52,509 --> 01:49:54,639
to all the folks all over the world.

1916
01:49:54,678 --> 01:49:58,308
There's fun and expectation
in every house across the land.

1917
01:49:58,348 --> 01:50:02,438
And speaking of houses, what do you say
we take a little look-in on a typical one?

1918
01:50:05,439 --> 01:50:10,989
Now I'll admit that what you see right now
is just a small piece of the front of the house...

1919
01:50:11,028 --> 01:50:14,908
but all you grownups and kids alike,
this is the time for Santa's magic...

1920
01:50:14,948 --> 01:50:18,158
so I think we can make it
become a real house.

1921
01:50:19,036 --> 01:50:20,616
Even a house with love in it.

1922
01:50:20,662 --> 01:50:23,712
Mr. Santa Claus, can we have
a little snow, please?

1923
01:50:25,792 --> 01:50:27,712
Thank you. That's fine.

1924
01:50:28,003 --> 01:50:32,053
Now, Santa, let me see what it
really looks like inside this house.

1925
01:51:01,411 --> 01:51:05,921
She couldn't know that one day
she would move into a big beautiful home.

1926
01:51:08,502 --> 01:51:10,752
Her mother was happy.

1927
01:51:11,547 --> 01:51:15,877
She remained close to her,
and with the rest of her family...

1928
01:51:15,926 --> 01:51:18,676
which was, as always, complicated.

1929
01:51:20,848 --> 01:51:26,188
She would pay for products made by
Rudy, Trudy, and Peggy.

1930
01:51:26,228 --> 01:51:28,268
Even when they failed.

1931
01:51:28,939 --> 01:51:33,689
Even when they wrongly sued
for ownership of her company.

1932
01:51:34,570 --> 01:51:39,280
As Rudy got older,
Joy continued to take care of him and love him.

1933
01:51:45,122 --> 01:51:50,792
As Neil Walker predicted,
Joy did become a whole new business.

1934
01:51:51,253 --> 01:51:53,343
And even outgrew QVC.

1935
01:51:53,380 --> 01:51:55,340
- She's talking to her children.
- Is Tony in there?

1936
01:51:55,424 --> 01:51:56,724
Yes, Tony's in there.
The family's in there.

1937
01:51:56,967 --> 01:52:03,177
Her ex-husband and her best friend
would remain her steadfast advisers.

1938
01:52:03,223 --> 01:52:04,563
Please be patient.

1939
01:52:10,314 --> 01:52:12,614
I love you.
You guys go and pack your rooms.

1940
01:52:12,649 --> 01:52:14,439
- Good night, Mom.
- I love you.

1941
01:52:23,452 --> 01:52:24,702
- Hi.
- Hi.

1942
01:52:24,745 --> 01:52:26,415
- Welcome.
- Thank you.

1943
01:52:29,082 --> 01:52:30,292
What do you have?

1944
01:52:30,334 --> 01:52:32,134
A traveling clothes cleaner.

1945
01:52:32,169 --> 01:52:33,169
Let's see it.

1946
01:52:34,129 --> 01:52:35,419
So you're from Memphis?

1947
01:52:35,464 --> 01:52:36,804
Yes, I am.

1948
01:52:36,840 --> 01:52:38,130
You work as a waitress?

1949
01:52:38,175 --> 01:52:39,475
Yes, ma'am.

1950
01:52:39,510 --> 01:52:42,010
All right. Let's see it.

1951
01:52:43,514 --> 01:52:44,814
You made this yourself?

1952
01:52:44,848 --> 01:52:45,848
Yes, I did, ma'am.

1953
01:52:46,850 --> 01:52:49,100
I made my first invention myself, too.

1954
01:52:50,521 --> 01:52:52,521
I like this, it's a very good design.

1955
01:52:52,773 --> 01:52:53,773
Thank you.

1956
01:52:53,815 --> 01:52:56,315
Can you stay an extra day,
meet with our designers?

1957
01:52:57,152 --> 01:52:58,362
No, because of your boss?

1958
01:52:59,988 --> 01:53:01,908
What hotel are you staying in right now?

1959
01:53:01,949 --> 01:53:03,659
- The Holiday Inn, ma'am.
- Holiday Inn.

1960
01:53:03,700 --> 01:53:05,790
Let's move them over to the Radisson,
get them a suite.

1961
01:53:05,827 --> 01:53:07,497
You'll be more comfortable
with your baby.

1962
01:53:07,538 --> 01:53:10,458
I'll call your boss and get it taken care of,
give you an extra day...

1963
01:53:10,499 --> 01:53:12,780
so that tomorrow you can come in,
meet with the designers.

1964
01:53:12,960 --> 01:53:14,710
- We can take it step by step, all right?
- Thank you.

1965
01:53:14,962 --> 01:53:16,762
We'll work on your idea,
see if we can do something.

1966
01:53:16,797 --> 01:53:18,627
This means so much to me.

1967
01:53:18,882 --> 01:53:20,382
I know what it feels like.

1968
01:53:20,843 --> 01:53:22,893
I know what it feels like
to be in that chair.

1969
01:53:23,554 --> 01:53:25,604
- We'll see you tomorrow, okay?
- Thank you, ma'am.

1970
01:53:25,639 --> 01:53:26,889
And good luck.

1971
01:53:27,182 --> 01:53:28,642
- Thank you for coming.
- Thank you.

1972
01:53:28,684 --> 01:53:31,394
- Go get the next person, Tony.
- Okay.

1973
01:53:31,895 --> 01:53:32,895
Neil.

1974
01:53:35,023 --> 01:53:37,153
Sorry, we have legal stuff
with Barry, now.

1975
01:53:40,487 --> 01:53:41,907
Yes, we do.

1976
01:53:43,323 --> 01:53:44,873
Here we are.

1977
01:53:44,908 --> 01:53:46,078
Here we are.

1978
01:53:47,703 --> 01:53:49,753
Adversaries in commerce.

1979
01:53:50,581 --> 01:53:52,751
Adversaries in commerce.

1980
01:53:53,917 --> 01:53:55,707
- And friends.
- Yes.

1981
01:53:56,170 --> 01:53:57,380
And friends.

1982
01:53:58,589 --> 01:54:01,259
I'm gonna tell you something
but you didn't hear it from me.

1983
01:54:01,592 --> 01:54:03,842
I don't know who you are
or what you're talking about.

1984
01:54:03,886 --> 01:54:05,506
That's what I wanted to hear.

1985
01:54:07,264 --> 01:54:09,354
Barry's gonna come after you, hard.

1986
01:54:09,391 --> 01:54:12,891
But that's just business.
That's the way Barry is. He's a negotiator.

1987
01:54:12,936 --> 01:54:15,226
Ultimately, he needs you.

1988
01:54:15,272 --> 01:54:18,572
He's buying HSN.

1989
01:54:18,609 --> 01:54:21,949
It's all about HSN now,
and he wants you to come with him.

1990
01:54:24,364 --> 01:54:25,914
He needs you.

1991
01:54:26,700 --> 01:54:28,790
You're going to be very big over there.

1992
01:54:29,286 --> 01:54:31,246
That's what's going to happen.

1993
01:54:31,663 --> 01:54:34,463
But, you didn't hear it from me, right?

1994
01:54:35,083 --> 01:54:39,253
No, I sure didn't.
But thank you.

1995
01:54:42,591 --> 01:54:44,631
It's nice to see you.

1996
01:54:44,676 --> 01:54:46,256
It's good to see you.

1997
01:54:48,555 --> 01:54:50,715
I'll see you around, pal.

1998
01:54:50,766 --> 01:54:52,726
Yeah.

1999
01:54:59,900 --> 01:55:01,110
It's been a long journey.

2000
01:55:01,151 --> 01:55:02,281
Yes, it has.

2001
01:55:02,319 --> 01:55:03,449
I'm proud of you.

2002
01:55:03,487 --> 01:55:04,697
Thank you, Neil.

2003
01:55:38,856 --> 01:55:42,396
This right here,
this is a special power.

2004
01:55:44,278 --> 01:55:46,148
This is a special power.

2005
01:55:50,868 --> 01:55:54,158
And then I started
to build my very own house...

2006
01:55:55,914 --> 01:55:58,674
where I would live
and make wonderful creations...

2007
01:55:58,709 --> 01:56:02,049
for all the world to see and love.

2008
01:56:07,718 --> 01:56:10,348
She didn't know any of this would happen...

2009
01:56:10,387 --> 01:56:13,257
as she walked that day.
