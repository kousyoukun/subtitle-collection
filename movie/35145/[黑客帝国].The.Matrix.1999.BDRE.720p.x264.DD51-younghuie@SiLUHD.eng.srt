1
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:52,760
Is everything in place? You weren't supposed to relieve me.

2
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,650
I know, but I felt like taking a shift.

3
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:58,600
You like him, don't you? You like watching him.

4
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,790
Don't be ridiculous. We're gonna kill him. You understand?

5
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:04,560
Morpheus believes he is the One.

6
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:05,740
Do you?

7
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:07,770
It doesn't matter what I believe.

8
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:09,600
You don't, do you?

9
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:11,970
Did you hear that? Hear what?

10
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:13,840
Are you sure this line is clean?

11
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:16,010
Yeah, of course I'm sure.

12
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:17,810
I better go.

13
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:57,550
Freeze! Police! Hands on your head!

14
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,220
Do it! Do it now!

15
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:21,940
Lieutenant.

16
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:23,210
Oh, shit.

17
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:27,280
Lieutenant, you were given specific orders.

18
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:29,250
I'm just doing my job.

19
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:34,290
You give me that "juris-my-dick-tion" crap, you can cram it up your ass.

20
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:37,230
The orders were for your protection.

21
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,960
I think we can handle one little girl.

22
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:47,870
I sent two units!

23
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:49,630
They're bringing her down now!

24
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,450
No, Lieutenant, your men are already dead.

25
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:23,270
Shit.

26
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:28,510
Morpheus, the line was traced. I don't know how.

27
00:03:28,610 --> 00:03:30,100
I know. They cut the hard line.

28
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:32,410
There's no time. Get to another exit.

29
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,120
Are there any agents?

30
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,080
Yes.

31
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,480
Goddamn it.

32
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:38,280
You have to focus, Trinity.

33
00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:40,920
There's a phone at Wells and Lake.

34
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:42,950
You can make it.

35
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,570
All right. Go.

36
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:48,050
That's impossible.

37
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,850
Get up, Trinity. Just get up.

38
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:25,660
Get up.

39
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:26,890
Get up.

40
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:14,300
She got out.

41
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:15,910
It doesn't matter.

42
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:18,210
The informant is real.

43
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:19,060
Yes

44
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:21,250
We have the name of their next target.

45
00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:23,110
The name is Neo.

46
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:27,920
We'll need a search running.

47
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:30,190
It has already begun.

48
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:26,110
What?

49
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,390
What the hell?

50
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:43,400
"Follow the white rabbit."

51
00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:55,970
Who is it?

52
00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:57,550
It's Choi.

53
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:12,220
You're two hours late.

54
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,530
I know. It's her fault.

55
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:15,770
You got the money?

56
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:19,060
Two grand.

57
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:21,060
Hold on.

58
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,160
Hallelujah.

59
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:43,480
You're my savior, man. My own personal Jesus Christ.

60
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,430
You get caught using that...

61
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:47,760
I know. This never happened. You don't exist.

62
00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:50,990
Right. Something wrong, man?

63
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:52,920
You look a little whiter than usual.

64
00:08:54,370 --> 00:08:56,500
My computer, it...

65
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:04,880
You ever have that feeling where you're not sure if you're awake or dreaming?

66
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:07,650
All the time. It's called mescaline.

67
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:10,310
It's the only way to fly.

68
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:13,660
It just sounds like you need to unplug, man.

69
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:16,430
Get some R and R?

70
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:20,530
What do you think, Dujour? Should we take him with us?

71
00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:23,830
Definitely.

72
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:27,230
No, I can't. I have work tomorrow.

73
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:28,900
Come on.

74
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:31,730
It'll be fun. I promise.

75
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,750
Yeah.

76
00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:42,420
Sure. I'll go.

77
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:11,180
Hello, Neo.

78
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:13,870
How did you know my name?

79
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:16,180
I know a lot about you.

80
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:17,880
Who are you?

81
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,180
My name is Trinity.

82
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:21,320
Trinity.

83
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:24,100
The Trinity?

84
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,330
That cracked the IRS D-base?

85
00:10:26,530 --> 00:10:28,060
That was a long time ago.

86
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:29,100
Jesus.

87
00:10:29,330 --> 00:10:30,130
What?

88
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,360
I just thought...

89
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,330
...you were a guy.

90
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:37,100
Most guys do.

91
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:40,440
That was you on my computer.

92
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:42,170
How did you do that?

93
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:45,540
Right now, all I can tell you...

94
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:47,710
...is that you're in danger.

95
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:50,620
I brought you here to warn you. Of what?

96
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:52,850
They're watching you, Neo.

97
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:54,250
Who is?

98
00:10:54,490 --> 00:10:55,860
Please, just listen.

99
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,230
I know why you're here, Neo.

100
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,970
I know what you've been doing.

101
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:06,070
I know why you hardly sleep...

102
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:09,500
...why you live alone, and why, night after night...

103
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:12,070
...you sit at your computer.

104
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,770
You're looking for him.

105
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:18,570
I know, because I was once looking for the same thing.

106
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:21,210
And when he found me...

107
00:11:21,830 --> 00:11:24,510
He told me, I wasn't really looking for him.

108
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:27,550
...I was looking for an answer.

109
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:31,350
It's the guestion that drives us, Neo.

110
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,660
It's the guestion that brought you here.

111
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,170
You know the guestion...

112
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,900
...just as I did.

113
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,100
What is the Matrix?

114
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:45,780
The answer is out there, Neo.

115
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,410
It's looking for you.

116
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:50,870
And it will find you...

117
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:53,220
...if you want it to.

118
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:00,650
Shit.

119
00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:02,320
Shit, shit.

120
00:12:12,570 --> 00:12:15,470
You have a problem with authority, Mr. Anderson.

121
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:17,250
You believe that you are special

122
00:12:17,390 --> 00:12:19,790
that the rules do not apply to you.

123
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:25,270
Obviously, you are mistaken.

124
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:28,320
This is one of the top software companies in the world...

125
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:31,960
...because employees understand they are part of a whole.

126
00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:36,720
Thus, if an employee has a problem, the company has a problem.

127
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:42,260
The time has come to make a choice, Mr. Anderson.

128
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:47,000
Either you choose to be at your desk on time from this day forth...

129
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:50,200
...or you choose to find another job.

130
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:52,470
Do I make myself clear?

131
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:54,840
Yes, Mr. Rhineheart. Perfectly clear.

132
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:04,420
Thomas Anderson?

133
00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:08,120
Yeah, that's me.

134
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:17,290
Great.

135
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:19,860
Have a nice day.

136
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:36,570
Hello

137
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:39,950
Hello, Neo. Do you know who this is?

138
00:13:42,290 --> 00:13:45,600
Morpheus. Yes. I'm looking for you, Neo.

139
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:49,690
I don't know if you're ready to see what I want to show you...

140
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:53,130
...but, unfortunately, you and I have run out of time.

141
00:13:53,370 --> 00:13:57,100
They're coming for you, and I don't know what they're going to do.

142
00:13:57,380 --> 00:13:58,710
Who's coming for me?

143
00:13:58,910 --> 00:14:01,000
Stand up and see for yourself.

144
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,750
What? Right now?

145
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:04,010
Yes.

146
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:05,540
Now.

147
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:08,320
Do it slowly.

148
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:09,910
The elevator.

149
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:15,560
Oh, shit!

150
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:16,810
Yes.

151
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:22,440
What do they want?

152
00:14:22,530 --> 00:14:26,160
I don't know. If you don't want to find out, get out of there.

153
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,030
How?

154
00:14:27,310 --> 00:14:30,400
I can guide you, but you must do exactly as I say.

155
00:14:30,450 --> 00:14:30,950
OK.

156
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:33,340
The cubicle across from you is empty.

157
00:14:36,450 --> 00:14:38,540
But what if they... Go. Now.

158
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:47,720
Stay here for just a moment.

159
00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:57,700
When I tell you, go to the end of the row...

160
00:14:57,940 --> 00:14:59,900
...to the office at the end of the hall.

161
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:02,500
Stay as low as you can.

162
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:05,910
Go. Now.

163
00:15:20,430 --> 00:15:23,860
Good. Now, outside there is a scaffold.

164
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,960
How do you know this? We don't have time.

165
00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:32,030
To your left there's a window. Go to it.

166
00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:35,740
Open it.

167
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:38,440
Take the scaffold to the roof.

168
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:41,270
No way! No way! This is crazy!

169
00:15:41,510 --> 00:15:43,910
There are two ways out of this building.

170
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:48,020
One is that scaffold. The other is in their custody.

171
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:51,350
You take a chance either way. I leave it to you.

172
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:56,690
This is insane!

173
00:15:57,930 --> 00:15:59,730
Why is this happening to me?

174
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:01,690
What'd I do?

175
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:04,830
I'm nobody. I didn't do anything.

176
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,900
I'm gonna die.

177
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:17,680
Shit!

178
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,090
Oh, shit!

179
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:45,840
I can't do this.

180
00:16:58,860 --> 00:16:59,580
Shit.

181
00:17:48,870 --> 00:17:53,640
As you can see, we've had our eye on you for some time now, Mr. Anderson.

182
00:17:55,010 --> 00:17:57,610
It seems that you've been living...

183
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,980
...two lives.

184
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:03,940
In one life, you're Thomas A. Anderson...

185
00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:07,520
...program writer for a respectable software company.

186
00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:11,860
You have a social security number. You pay your taxes.

187
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:13,560
And you...

188
00:18:15,170 --> 00:18:18,760
...help your landlady carry out her garbage.

189
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:24,370
The other life is lived in computers...

190
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:27,900
...where you go by the hacker alias "Neo"...

191
00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:32,710
...and are guilty of virtually every computer crime we have a law for.

192
00:18:34,050 --> 00:18:36,020
One of these lives...

193
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:38,050
...has a future.

194
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:40,360
And one of them does not.

195
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:47,900
I'm going to be as forthcoming as I can be, Mr. Anderson.

196
00:18:48,970 --> 00:18:50,260
You're here...

197
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,800
...because we need your help.

198
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:59,530
We know that you've been contacted by a certain...

199
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:00,980
...individual.

200
00:19:01,010 --> 00:19:05,520
A man who calls himself "Morpheus."

201
00:19:07,490 --> 00:19:11,440
Whatever you think you know about this man is irrelevant.

202
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:14,210
He is considered by many authorities...

203
00:19:14,430 --> 00:19:17,390
...to be the most dangerous man alive.

204
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:21,360
My colleagues...

205
00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:24,800
...believe that I am wasting my time with you.

206
00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:28,440
But I believe you wish to do the right thing.

207
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:32,270
We're willing to wipe the slate clean...

208
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,700
...give you a fresh start.

209
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:38,250
All we're asking in return is your cooperation...

210
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:41,910
...in bringing a known terrorist to justice.

211
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:44,580
Yeah.

212
00:19:45,890 --> 00:19:47,950
That sounds like a really good deal.

213
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:51,320
But I got a better one.

214
00:19:51,530 --> 00:19:53,050
How about...

215
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:55,470
...I give you the finger...

216
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:00,100
...and you give me my phone call.

217
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:04,100
Mr. Anderson...

218
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:09,340
...you disappoint me.

219
00:20:09,650 --> 00:20:12,240
You can't scare me with this gestapo crap.

220
00:20:12,450 --> 00:20:13,920
I know my rights.

221
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:15,550
I want my phone call.

222
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:18,310
Tell me, Mr. Anderson...

223
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:20,690
...what good is a phone call...

224
00:20:20,890 --> 00:20:24,450
...if you're unable to speak?

225
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:00,460
You're going to help us, Mr. Anderson...

226
00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:03,550
...whether you want to or not.

227
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:04,860
This line is tapped, so I must be brief.

228
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:09,430
They got to you first, but they've underestimated how important you are.

229
00:22:09,630 --> 00:22:11,430
If they knew what I know...

230
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:13,670
...you would probably be dead.

231
00:22:14,770 --> 00:22:17,900
What are you talking about? What is happening to me?

232
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:23,520
You are the One, Neo. You may have spent the last few years...

233
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:26,680
...looking for me, but I've spent my entire life...

234
00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:28,440
...looking for you.

235
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:32,150
Now, do you still want to meet?

236
00:22:33,190 --> 00:22:35,990
Yes. Then go to the Adams Street bridge.

237
00:22:46,270 --> 00:22:47,360
Get in.

238
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:00,550
What's hell this is?

239
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:03,340
It's necessary, Neo. For our protection.

240
00:23:03,670 --> 00:23:04,670
From what?

241
00:23:04,890 --> 00:23:05,820
From you.

242
00:23:07,290 --> 00:23:08,200
Take off your shirt.

243
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:08,830
What?

244
00:23:09,330 --> 00:23:10,120
Stop the car.

245
00:23:14,670 --> 00:23:15,890
Listen, coppertop.

246
00:23:16,050 --> 00:23:18,570
We don't have time for twenty questions.

247
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,930
Right now, there's only one rule:

248
00:23:21,310 --> 00:23:22,570
Our way...

249
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:24,000
...or the highway.

250
00:23:30,810 --> 00:23:31,610
Fine.

251
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:36,010
Please, Neo, you have to trust me.

252
00:23:36,550 --> 00:23:39,870
Why? Because you have been down there.

253
00:23:39,990 --> 00:23:41,180
You know that road.

254
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:43,750
You know exactly where it ends.

255
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,230
And I know that's not where you want to be.

256
00:24:02,450 --> 00:24:03,970
Apoc, lights.

257
00:24:06,550 --> 00:24:08,610
Lie back. Lift up your shirt.

258
00:24:10,590 --> 00:24:11,380
What is that?

259
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:12,850
You're bugged.

260
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:22,090
Try and relax.

261
00:24:28,370 --> 00:24:29,460
Come on.

262
00:24:30,670 --> 00:24:31,610
Come on.

263
00:24:33,410 --> 00:24:34,270
It's on the move.

264
00:24:36,150 --> 00:24:37,340
Come on, you shit.

265
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:41,480
You're gonna lose it. No, I'm not.

266
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:42,680
Clear!

267
00:24:50,790 --> 00:24:52,950
Jesus Christ! That thing's real?!

268
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,430
This is it.

269
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:34,270
Let me give you one piece of advice.

270
00:25:35,310 --> 00:25:36,860
Be honest.

271
00:25:38,510 --> 00:25:40,640
He knows more than you can imagine.

272
00:25:49,450 --> 00:25:50,750
At last.

273
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:53,350
Welcome, Neo.

274
00:25:54,590 --> 00:25:56,530
As you no doubt have guessed...

275
00:25:56,790 --> 00:25:58,020
...I am Morpheus.

276
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:00,620
It's an honor to meet you.

277
00:26:01,030 --> 00:26:02,030
No

278
00:26:02,730 --> 00:26:04,030
...the honor is mine.

279
00:26:04,970 --> 00:26:07,400
Please, come. Sit.

280
00:26:22,550 --> 00:26:24,180
I imagine...

281
00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:27,350
...that right now you're feeling a bit like Alice.

282
00:26:29,090 --> 00:26:31,460
Tumbling down the rabbit hole?

283
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,360
You could say that.

284
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:36,860
I can see it in your eyes.

285
00:26:37,530 --> 00:26:40,800
You have the look of a man who accepts what he sees...

286
00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:43,340
...because he's expecting to wake up.

287
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:47,300
Ironically, this is not far from the truth.

288
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:50,480
Do you believe in fate, Neo?

289
00:26:50,810 --> 00:26:51,610
No.

290
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:53,180
Why not?

291
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:56,180
I don't like the idea that I'm not in control of my life.

292
00:26:57,250 --> 00:27:00,550
I know exactly what you mean.

293
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:07,300
Let me tell you why you're here.

294
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:09,820
You know something.

295
00:27:10,370 --> 00:27:12,030
What you know, you can't explain.

296
00:27:12,470 --> 00:27:14,100
But you feel it.

297
00:27:14,670 --> 00:27:16,610
You felt it your entire life:

298
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:21,340
Something's wrong with the world. You don't know what, but it's there.

299
00:27:21,810 --> 00:27:24,110
Like a splinter in your mind...

300
00:27:24,350 --> 00:27:26,180
...driving you mad.

301
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:29,850
It is this feeling that has brought you to me.

302
00:27:32,390 --> 00:27:34,220
Do you know what I'm talking about?

303
00:27:36,130 --> 00:27:37,350
The Matrix?

304
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:41,520
Do you want to know...

305
00:27:42,070 --> 00:27:44,000
...what it is?

306
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:48,370
The Matrix is everywhere.

307
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:50,300
It is all around us.

308
00:27:50,510 --> 00:27:52,480
Even now, in this very room.

309
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:55,540
You can see it when you look out your window...

310
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:58,110
...or when you turn on your television.

311
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:01,080
You can feel it when you go to work...

312
00:28:02,550 --> 00:28:04,280
...when you go to church...

313
00:28:04,690 --> 00:28:06,750
...when you pay your taxes.

314
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:10,830
It is the world that has been pulled over your eyes...

315
00:28:11,030 --> 00:28:12,620
...to blind you from the truth.

316
00:28:14,830 --> 00:28:16,130
What truth?

317
00:28:20,370 --> 00:28:22,860
That you are a slave.

318
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:25,710
Like everyone else, you were born into bondage...

319
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:30,570
...born into a prison that you cannot smell or taste or touch.

320
00:28:30,950 --> 00:28:32,280
A prison...

321
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,540
...for your mind.

322
00:28:40,590 --> 00:28:42,920
Unfortunately, no one can be...

323
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:45,660
...told what the Matrix is.

324
00:28:49,170 --> 00:28:50,960
You have to see it for yourself.

325
00:29:00,510 --> 00:29:02,740
This is your last chance.

326
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:05,350
After this, there is no turning back.

327
00:29:05,850 --> 00:29:07,320
You take the blue pill...

328
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:10,680
...the story ends, you wake up in your bed and believe...

329
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:12,680
...whatever you want to believe.

330
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,290
You take the red pill...

331
00:29:14,490 --> 00:29:16,460
...you stay in Wonderland...

332
00:29:17,030 --> 00:29:19,660
...and I show you how deep the rabbit hole goes.

333
00:29:29,610 --> 00:29:30,770
Remember...

334
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:34,610
...all I'm offering is the truth. Nothing more.

335
00:29:49,030 --> 00:29:50,320
Follow me.

336
00:29:52,830 --> 00:29:54,560
Apoc, are we on-line?

337
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:56,130
Almost.

338
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:01,530
Time is always against us.

339
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:03,410
Please, take a seat there.

340
00:30:21,630 --> 00:30:23,290
You did all this?

341
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:29,430
The pill you took is part of a trace program.

342
00:30:30,270 --> 00:30:34,800
It disrupts your carrier signals so we can pinpoint your location.

343
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:36,980
What dos that mean?

344
00:30:37,010 --> 00:30:39,130
It means buckle your seat belt, Dorothy...

345
00:30:39,510 --> 00:30:40,810
...because IKansas...

346
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:42,070
...is going bye-bye.

347
00:31:20,050 --> 00:31:21,420
Did you?

348
00:31:32,430 --> 00:31:36,490
Have you ever had a dream, Neo, that you were so sure was real?

349
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,530
What if you were unable to wake from that dream?

350
00:31:40,770 --> 00:31:43,330
How would you know the difference between the dream world...

351
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:45,370
...and the real world?

352
00:31:47,010 --> 00:31:48,170
This can't be.

353
00:31:48,450 --> 00:31:49,380
Be what?

354
00:31:50,050 --> 00:31:51,540
Be real?

355
00:31:55,550 --> 00:31:56,810
Going into replication.

356
00:31:56,820 --> 00:31:57,100
Apoc

357
00:31:57,250 --> 00:31:58,120
Still nothing.

358
00:31:58,760 --> 00:31:59,920
It's cold.

359
00:32:00,190 --> 00:32:01,590
It's cold!

360
00:32:05,430 --> 00:32:07,120
Tank, we'll need a signal soon.

361
00:32:08,670 --> 00:32:09,560
I got a fibrillation.

362
00:32:09,770 --> 00:32:11,320
Apoc, location.

363
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:13,000
Targeting almost there.

364
00:32:16,370 --> 00:32:17,740
He's going into arrest.

365
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:18,770
Lock. I got him!

366
00:32:19,010 --> 00:32:19,810
Now, Tank, now!

367
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:18,790
Welcome...

368
00:35:19,170 --> 00:35:21,070
...to the real world.

369
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:24,330
We've done it, Trinity.

370
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:26,130
We found him.

371
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:29,170
I hope you're right. I don't have to hope.

372
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:31,300
I know it.

373
00:35:36,450 --> 00:35:37,540
Am I dead?

374
00:35:37,990 --> 00:35:40,150
Far from it.

375
00:35:54,170 --> 00:35:55,600
He still needs a lot of work.

376
00:35:57,140 --> 00:35:58,230
What are you doing?

377
00:35:58,410 --> 00:36:00,670
Your muscles atrophied. We're rebuilding them.

378
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:02,800
Why do my eyes hurt?

379
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:05,380
You've never used them before.

380
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:10,210
Rest, Neo.

381
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:12,110
The answers are coming.

382
00:37:26,690 --> 00:37:28,290
Morpheus, what's happened to me?

383
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:30,210
What is this place?

384
00:37:30,230 --> 00:37:32,860
More important than "what" is "when."

385
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:34,390
"When"?

386
00:37:34,630 --> 00:37:36,690
You believe it's the year 1999...

387
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:39,170
...when, in fact, it's closer to 2199.

388
00:37:40,270 --> 00:37:43,110
I can't tell you exactly what year it is...

389
00:37:43,310 --> 00:37:44,970
...because we honestly don't know.

390
00:37:45,410 --> 00:37:48,310
There's nothing I can say that will explain it for you.

391
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:49,680
Come with me.

392
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:51,310
See for yourself.

393
00:37:51,790 --> 00:37:53,510
This is my ship.

394
00:37:53,890 --> 00:37:56,750
The Nebuchadnezzar. It's a hovercraft.

395
00:37:59,590 --> 00:38:01,360
This is the main deck.

396
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:08,910
This is the core.

397
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:14,670
...where we broadcast our pirate signal and hack into the Matrix.

398
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:21,140
Most of my crew you already know.

399
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:27,580
This is Apoc...

400
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:29,750
...Switch...

401
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:32,480
...and Cypher.

402
00:38:32,730 --> 00:38:36,390
The ones you don't know, Tank and his big brother, Dozer.

403
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:39,730
The little one behind you is Mouse.

404
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:47,340
You wanted to know what the Matrix is?

405
00:38:48,380 --> 00:38:49,570
Trinity.

406
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:12,220
Try to relax.

407
00:39:17,070 --> 00:39:18,940
This will feel a little weird.

408
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:32,080
This...

409
00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:34,150
...is the Construct.

410
00:39:34,550 --> 00:39:36,650
It's our loading program.

411
00:39:36,890 --> 00:39:39,420
We can load anything, from clothing...

412
00:39:39,630 --> 00:39:40,990
...to eguipment...

413
00:39:41,330 --> 00:39:42,630
...weapons...

414
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:45,060
...training simulations...

415
00:39:45,470 --> 00:39:48,030
...anything we need.

416
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:53,270
Right now we're inside a computer program?

417
00:39:53,470 --> 00:39:55,440
Is it really so hard to believe?

418
00:39:55,940 --> 00:39:58,570
Your clothes are different. The plugs in your body are gone.

419
00:39:59,710 --> 00:40:01,840
Your hair has changed.

420
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:05,550
Your appearance now is what we call "residual self-image."

421
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:08,910
It is the mental projection of your digital self.

422
00:40:14,830 --> 00:40:15,950
This isn't real?

423
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:17,660
What is "real"?

424
00:40:18,130 --> 00:40:20,330
How do you define "real"?

425
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:22,720
If you are talking about what you can feel...

426
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:25,270
...what you can smell, what you can taste and see...

427
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:29,340
...then "real" is simply electrical signals interpreted by your brain.

428
00:40:33,510 --> 00:40:35,980
This is the world that you know.

429
00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:41,220
The world as it was at the end of the 20th century.

430
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:47,190
It exists now only as part of a neural-interactive simulation...

431
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,590
...that we call the Matrix.

432
00:40:53,170 --> 00:40:55,960
You've been living in a dream world, Neo.

433
00:40:56,970 --> 00:40:58,060
This is the world...

434
00:40:58,340 --> 00:41:00,140
...as it exists today.

435
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:16,190
Welcome to the desert...

436
00:41:16,990 --> 00:41:18,580
...of the real.

437
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,360
We have only bits and pieces of information.

438
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:28,400
But what we know for certain is that in the early 21 st century...

439
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:31,940
...all of mankind was united in celebration.

440
00:41:32,140 --> 00:41:37,440
We marveled at our own magnificence as we gave birth to Al.

441
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:38,800
Al.

442
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:41,280
You mean artificial intelligence.

443
00:41:41,450 --> 00:41:45,940
A singular consciousness that spawned an entire race of machines.

444
00:41:46,750 --> 00:41:50,210
We don't know who struck first, us or them.

445
00:41:50,590 --> 00:41:53,890
But we know that it was us that scorched the sky.

446
00:41:55,530 --> 00:41:57,660
They were dependent on solar power...

447
00:41:57,900 --> 00:42:01,300
...and it was believed that they would be unable to survive...

448
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:05,130
...without an energy source as abundant as the sun.

449
00:42:05,340 --> 00:42:10,280
Throughout human history, we have been dependent on machines to survive.

450
00:42:11,710 --> 00:42:15,940
Fate, it seems, is not without a sense of irony.

451
00:42:19,150 --> 00:42:23,520
The human body generates more bioelectricity than a 120-volt battery.

452
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:27,850
And over 25,000 BTUs of body heat.

453
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:31,990
Combined with a form of fusion...

454
00:42:32,330 --> 00:42:37,170
...the machines had found all the energy they would ever need.

455
00:42:41,270 --> 00:42:45,010
There are fields, Neo, endless fields...

456
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:48,480
...where human beings are no longer born.

457
00:42:49,220 --> 00:42:51,050
We are grown.

458
00:42:57,060 --> 00:42:59,690
For the longest time, I wouldn't believe it.

459
00:42:59,890 --> 00:43:02,590
And then I saw the fields with my own eyes...

460
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:05,590
...watched them liguefy the dead...

461
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:09,170
...so they could be fed intravenously to the living.

462
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:13,900
And standing there, facing the pure, horrifying precision...

463
00:43:14,140 --> 00:43:17,110
...I came to realize the obviousness of the truth.

464
00:43:19,710 --> 00:43:21,510
What is the Matrix?

465
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:23,770
Control.

466
00:43:25,150 --> 00:43:28,480
The Matrix is a computer-generated dream world...

467
00:43:29,290 --> 00:43:32,350
...built to keep us under control...

468
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:36,690
...in order to change a human being...

469
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:38,520
...into this.

470
00:43:39,870 --> 00:43:41,060
No.

471
00:43:42,670 --> 00:43:44,260
I don't believe it.

472
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:45,830
It's not possible.

473
00:43:46,410 --> 00:43:51,040
I didn't say it would be easy, Neo. I just said it would be the truth.

474
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:52,070
Stop!

475
00:43:53,110 --> 00:43:54,270
Let me out!

476
00:43:55,050 --> 00:43:56,910
Let me out! I want out!

477
00:43:58,890 --> 00:44:01,550
Easy, Neo. Easy. Get this thing out of me.

478
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:03,450
Get this thing out of me!

479
00:44:05,290 --> 00:44:06,780
Don't touch me!

480
00:44:07,030 --> 00:44:08,620
Stay away from me!

481
00:44:09,100 --> 00:44:10,560
I don't believe it.

482
00:44:11,260 --> 00:44:12,530
I don't believe it.

483
00:44:14,470 --> 00:44:16,530
He's gonna pop. Breathe, Neo.

484
00:44:17,140 --> 00:44:17,970
Just breathe.

485
00:44:36,390 --> 00:44:38,150
I can't go back, can I?

486
00:44:38,370 --> 00:44:39,170
No.

487
00:44:41,260 --> 00:44:42,460
But if you could...

488
00:44:43,300 --> 00:44:44,760
...would you really want to?

489
00:44:47,330 --> 00:44:48,660
I owe you an apology.

490
00:44:49,300 --> 00:44:50,600
We have a rule:

491
00:44:51,140 --> 00:44:54,500
We never free a mind once it's reached a certain age.

492
00:44:54,710 --> 00:44:55,610
It's dangerous.

493
00:44:56,340 --> 00:44:58,070
The mind has trouble letting go.

494
00:44:58,280 --> 00:45:00,580
I've seen it before, and I'm sorry.

495
00:45:01,580 --> 00:45:03,670
I did what I did because...

496
00:45:04,420 --> 00:45:05,880
...I had to.

497
00:45:14,330 --> 00:45:18,390
When the Matrix was first built, there was a man born inside...

498
00:45:18,830 --> 00:45:22,670
...who had the ability to change whatever he wanted...

499
00:45:23,100 --> 00:45:25,970
...to remake the Matrix as he saw fit.

500
00:45:27,710 --> 00:45:31,200
It was he who freed the first of us...

501
00:45:32,110 --> 00:45:33,670
...taught us the truth.

502
00:45:35,180 --> 00:45:38,240
As long as the Matrix exists...

503
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:40,610
...the human race will never be free.

504
00:45:44,820 --> 00:45:46,380
After he died...

505
00:45:47,190 --> 00:45:49,860
...the Oracle prophesied his return...

506
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:53,630
...and that his coming would hail the destruction of the Matrix...

507
00:45:53,830 --> 00:45:55,490
...end the war...

508
00:45:55,870 --> 00:45:57,130
...bring freedom to our people.

509
00:45:58,440 --> 00:46:03,140
That is why there are those of us who spent our lives searching the Matrix...

510
00:46:03,410 --> 00:46:04,970
...looking for him.

511
00:46:07,410 --> 00:46:09,510
I did what I did because...

512
00:46:11,180 --> 00:46:13,280
...I believe that search is over.

513
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:19,760
Get some rest.

514
00:46:20,390 --> 00:46:22,220
You're going to need it.

515
00:46:25,100 --> 00:46:26,030
For what?

516
00:46:28,650 --> 00:46:30,650
Your training.

517
00:46:48,450 --> 00:46:50,240
Morning. Did you sleep?

518
00:46:51,080 --> 00:46:52,310
You will tonight.

519
00:46:52,620 --> 00:46:54,240
I guarantee it.

520
00:46:55,720 --> 00:46:57,650
I'm Tank. I'll be your operator.

521
00:46:58,060 --> 00:47:00,520
You don't have any... Holes? Nope.

522
00:47:01,170 --> 00:47:06,170
Me and my brother, Dozer, are 100% pure, old-fashioned, homegrown human.

523
00:47:06,370 --> 00:47:07,560
Born free right here...

524
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:09,460
...in the real world.

525
00:47:09,740 --> 00:47:11,360
Genuine child of Zion.

526
00:47:12,270 --> 00:47:14,670
Of Zion? If the war was over tomorrow...

527
00:47:14,910 --> 00:47:16,370
...Zion's where the party would be.

528
00:47:16,810 --> 00:47:18,140
It's a city?

529
00:47:18,410 --> 00:47:21,570
The last human city. The only place we have left.

530
00:47:23,150 --> 00:47:24,410
Where is it?

531
00:47:26,120 --> 00:47:27,210
Deep underground...

532
00:47:27,420 --> 00:47:29,580
...near the Earth's core, where it's still warm.

533
00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:33,090
You live long enough, you might see it.

534
00:47:35,330 --> 00:47:40,260
Goddamn! I gotta tell you, I'm excited to see what you're capable of...

535
00:47:40,430 --> 00:47:42,230
...if Morpheus is right and all.

536
00:47:42,630 --> 00:47:45,470
We're not supposed to talk about this, but...

537
00:47:45,670 --> 00:47:47,100
...if you are...

538
00:47:48,030 --> 00:47:49,430
A very exciting time.

539
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:53,940
We got a lot to do. We gotta get to it.

540
00:47:57,850 --> 00:48:00,780
We're supposed to start with these programs first.

541
00:48:01,750 --> 00:48:03,900
That's major boring shit.

542
00:48:04,130 --> 00:48:07,450
Let's do something more fun. How about...

543
00:48:08,630 --> 00:48:10,350
...combat training?

544
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:17,870
"Jujitsu"?

545
00:48:18,770 --> 00:48:20,400
I'm going to learn jujitsu?

546
00:48:31,750 --> 00:48:32,980
Holy shit!

547
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:35,550
"Hey, Mikey, I think he likes it."

548
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:37,220
How about some more?

549
00:48:37,420 --> 00:48:38,750
Hell, yes.

550
00:48:40,990 --> 00:48:41,860
Hell, yeah.

551
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:55,140
How is he?

552
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:59,270
Ten hours straight. He's a machine.

553
00:49:08,790 --> 00:49:10,150
I know kung fu.

554
00:49:12,020 --> 00:49:12,850
Show me.

555
00:49:14,630 --> 00:49:16,390
This is a sparring program...

556
00:49:16,590 --> 00:49:19,390
...similar to the programmed reality of the Matrix.

557
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:22,030
It has the same basic rules. Like gravity.

558
00:49:22,130 --> 00:49:25,690
These rules are no different than those of a computer system.

559
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:27,760
Some of them can be bent.

560
00:49:27,970 --> 00:49:28,800
Others...

561
00:49:29,010 --> 00:49:30,370
...can be broken.

562
00:49:30,610 --> 00:49:31,910
Understand?

563
00:49:33,340 --> 00:49:34,170
Then hit me...

564
00:49:34,750 --> 00:49:35,840
...if you can.

565
00:50:15,090 --> 00:50:15,910
Good!

566
00:50:16,690 --> 00:50:17,850
Adaptation...

567
00:50:18,120 --> 00:50:19,380
...improvisation.

568
00:50:19,660 --> 00:50:21,020
But your weakness...

569
00:50:21,220 --> 00:50:22,710
...is not your technigue.

570
00:50:29,530 --> 00:50:30,690
Morpheus is fighting Neo.

571
00:51:43,910 --> 00:51:45,130
How did I beat you?

572
00:51:51,710 --> 00:51:52,770
You're too fast.

573
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:54,680
Do you believe that...

574
00:51:55,020 --> 00:51:57,540
...my being stronger or faster...

575
00:51:57,790 --> 00:52:01,480
...has anything to do with my muscles in this place?

576
00:52:05,430 --> 00:52:07,290
You think you're breathing air?

577
00:52:20,840 --> 00:52:22,040
Again!

578
00:52:33,460 --> 00:52:35,890
Jesus Christ, he's fast!

579
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:38,350
His neuro-kinetics are way above normal.

580
00:52:42,870 --> 00:52:45,310
What are you waiting for?

581
00:52:45,330 --> 00:52:47,480
You're faster than this.

582
00:52:49,740 --> 00:52:51,930
Don't think you are.

583
00:52:52,210 --> 00:52:53,870
Know you are.

584
00:53:04,250 --> 00:53:07,020
Come on! Stop trying to hit me, and hit me!

585
00:53:16,970 --> 00:53:17,900
I don't believe it.

586
00:53:20,270 --> 00:53:22,330
I know what you're trying to do.

587
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,200
I'm trying to free your mind, Neo.

588
00:53:26,510 --> 00:53:28,630
But I can only show you the door.

589
00:53:29,180 --> 00:53:31,110
You have to walk through it.

590
00:53:33,350 --> 00:53:35,580
Tank, load the jump program.

591
00:53:46,560 --> 00:53:49,840
You have to let it all go, Neo. Fear...

592
00:53:49,860 --> 00:53:53,360
...doubt and disbelief.

593
00:53:53,770 --> 00:53:56,430
Free your mind.

594
00:54:12,550 --> 00:54:14,320
Okey-dokey.

595
00:54:16,390 --> 00:54:17,550
Free my mind.

596
00:54:17,700 --> 00:54:19,100
What if he makes it?

597
00:54:19,160 --> 00:54:22,120
No one's ever made their first jump. I know.

598
00:54:22,430 --> 00:54:25,930
But what if he does? He won't.

599
00:54:26,770 --> 00:54:27,560
Come on.

600
00:54:27,870 --> 00:54:29,030
All right.

601
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:31,500
No problem. Free my mind.

602
00:54:32,340 --> 00:54:35,100
Free my mind. No problem. Right.

603
00:54:54,460 --> 00:54:56,190
What does that mean?

604
00:54:56,500 --> 00:54:58,360
It doesn't mean anything.

605
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,520
Everybody falls the first time.

606
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:03,300
Right, Trin?

607
00:55:23,620 --> 00:55:27,190
I thought it wasn't real. Your mind makes it real.

608
00:55:29,830 --> 00:55:32,090
If you're killed in the Matrix...

609
00:55:32,200 --> 00:55:33,330
...you die here?

610
00:55:33,930 --> 00:55:36,400
The body cannot live without the mind.

611
00:56:06,930 --> 00:56:10,300
I don't remember you ever bringing me dinner.

612
00:56:13,340 --> 00:56:16,210
There is something about him, isn't there?

613
00:56:16,810 --> 00:56:18,440
You're a believer now?

614
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:20,640
I keep wondering...

615
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:24,580
...if Morpheus is so sure, why not take him to see the Oracle?

616
00:56:25,450 --> 00:56:28,420
Morpheus will take him when he's ready.

617
00:56:38,230 --> 00:56:39,790
The Matrix is a system, Neo.

618
00:56:41,500 --> 00:56:42,800
That system is our enemy.

619
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:45,800
But when you're inside, what do you see?

620
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:49,840
Businessmen, teachers, lawyers, carpenters.

621
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:52,900
The very minds of the people we are trying to save.

622
00:56:53,110 --> 00:56:56,140
But until we do, these people are a part of that system...

623
00:56:56,310 --> 00:56:58,250
...and that makes them our enemy.

624
00:56:58,580 --> 00:56:59,610
You have to understand...

625
00:56:59,850 --> 00:57:03,290
...most of these people are not ready to be unplugged.

626
00:57:03,460 --> 00:57:05,080
And many of them are so inert...

627
00:57:05,290 --> 00:57:07,700
...so hopelessly dependent on the system...

628
00:57:07,930 --> 00:57:10,660
...that they will fight to protect it.

629
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:15,930
Were you listening to me or looking at the woman in the red dress?

630
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:17,000
I was...

631
00:57:17,020 --> 00:57:17,870
Look again.

632
00:57:19,100 --> 00:57:20,200
Freeze it.

633
00:57:24,310 --> 00:57:28,300
This isn't the Matrix? No.

634
00:57:30,250 --> 00:57:34,050
It's another training program designed to teach you one thing:

635
00:57:34,690 --> 00:57:37,150
If you are not one of us, you are one of them.

636
00:57:37,260 --> 00:57:40,420
What are they? Sentient programs.

637
00:57:41,190 --> 00:57:45,460
They can move in and out of any software still hardwired to their system.

638
00:57:45,900 --> 00:57:49,260
That means that anyone we haven't unplugged...

639
00:57:49,530 --> 00:57:50,900
...is potentially an agent.

640
00:57:51,900 --> 00:57:53,660
Inside the Matrix...

641
00:57:54,340 --> 00:57:56,000
...they are everyone...

642
00:57:56,310 --> 00:57:58,070
...and they are no one.

643
00:57:58,280 --> 00:58:01,470
We have survived by hiding and running from them...

644
00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:03,340
...but they are the gatekeepers.

645
00:58:03,360 --> 00:58:06,830
They are guarding all the doors, they are holding all the keys, which means

646
00:58:06,850 --> 00:58:09,550
Sooner or later, someone will have to fight them.

647
00:58:10,120 --> 00:58:11,120
Someone

648
00:58:11,320 --> 00:58:12,690
I won't lie to you, Neo.

649
00:58:13,220 --> 00:58:18,090
Every single man or woman who has fought an agent, has died.

650
00:58:18,300 --> 00:58:20,660
But where they have failed, you will succeed.

651
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:21,830
Why?

652
00:58:21,930 --> 00:58:24,460
I've seen an agent punch through a concrete wall.

653
00:58:24,670 --> 00:58:28,330
Men have emptied entire clips at them and hit nothing but air.

654
00:58:28,510 --> 00:58:33,200
Yet their strength and speed are still based in a world built on rules.

655
00:58:33,380 --> 00:58:34,570
Because of that...

656
00:58:34,780 --> 00:58:38,180
...they will never be as strong or as fast as you can be.

657
00:58:42,450 --> 00:58:44,320
What are you telling me?

658
00:58:45,060 --> 00:58:46,490
That I can dodge bullets?

659
00:58:48,490 --> 00:58:49,920
No, Neo.

660
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:53,330
I'm trying to tell you that when you're ready...

661
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:55,490
...you won't have to.

662
00:59:00,100 --> 00:59:00,930
We got trouble.

663
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:21,190
Did Zion send the warning?

664
00:59:21,360 --> 00:59:22,220
No, another ship.

665
00:59:25,460 --> 00:59:26,830
Shit.

666
00:59:27,060 --> 00:59:28,760
Sguiddy's sweeping in guick.

667
00:59:29,130 --> 00:59:29,960
Sguiddy?

668
00:59:30,170 --> 00:59:33,400
A sentinel. A killing machine designed for one thing.

669
00:59:33,600 --> 00:59:34,760
Search and destroy.

670
00:59:36,140 --> 00:59:37,330
Set her down there.

671
00:59:58,700 --> 01:00:00,120
How are we doing, Tank?

672
01:00:08,310 --> 01:00:10,020
Power off-line.

673
01:00:10,310 --> 01:00:14,490
EMP on... and ready.

674
01:00:14,500 --> 01:00:16,710
EMP? Electromagnetic pulse.

675
01:00:16,910 --> 01:00:19,850
Disables any electrical system in the blast radius.

676
01:00:20,080 --> 01:00:22,310
It's the only weapon we have against the machines.

677
01:00:28,060 --> 01:00:28,850
Where are we?

678
01:00:29,130 --> 01:00:31,180
Their old service and waste systems.

679
01:00:32,730 --> 01:00:33,560
Sewers.

680
01:00:33,760 --> 01:00:36,460
There used to be cities that spanned hundreds of miles.

681
01:00:37,030 --> 01:00:38,930
Now these sewers are all that's left.

682
01:00:39,170 --> 01:00:40,430
Quiet.

683
01:01:20,770 --> 01:01:23,010
Oh! Neo!

684
01:01:24,350 --> 01:01:26,510
You scared the bejesus out of me.

685
01:01:27,580 --> 01:01:29,520
Sorry. It's okay.

686
01:01:32,450 --> 01:01:33,320
Is that?

687
01:01:33,520 --> 01:01:35,110
The Matrix?

688
01:01:38,330 --> 01:01:41,520
Do you always look at it encoded? Well, you have to.

689
01:01:41,700 --> 01:01:44,860
The image translators work for the construct program.

690
01:01:45,100 --> 01:01:48,500
But there's way too much information to decode the Matrix.

691
01:01:48,500 --> 01:01:51,670
You get used to it. I don't even see the code.

692
01:01:51,870 --> 01:01:54,330
All I see is blonde, brunette, redhead.

693
01:01:54,510 --> 01:01:57,860
Do you...

694
01:01:58,210 --> 01:01:59,270
...want a drink?

695
01:01:59,510 --> 01:02:00,570
Sure.

696
01:02:04,150 --> 01:02:05,580
You know...

697
01:02:06,450 --> 01:02:08,010
...I know what you're thinking.

698
01:02:08,290 --> 01:02:10,350
Because right now I'm thinking the same thing.

699
01:02:10,730 --> 01:02:14,090
Actually, I've been thinking it ever since I got here.

700
01:02:15,840 --> 01:02:18,640
Why, oh, why didn't I take the blue pill?

701
01:02:31,350 --> 01:02:33,280
Good shit, huh?

702
01:02:33,610 --> 01:02:34,810
Dozer makes it.

703
01:02:35,250 --> 01:02:36,440
It's good for two things:

704
01:02:36,650 --> 01:02:39,710
Degreasing engines and killing brain cells.

705
01:02:40,790 --> 01:02:42,980
So can I ask you something?

706
01:02:45,990 --> 01:02:47,620
Did he tell you why he did it?

707
01:02:50,260 --> 01:02:52,060
Why you're here?

708
01:02:55,770 --> 01:02:57,500
Jesus!

709
01:02:58,710 --> 01:03:00,570
What a mind job.

710
01:03:02,040 --> 01:03:04,840
So you're here to save the world.

711
01:03:06,350 --> 01:03:08,410
What do you say to something like that?

712
01:03:13,590 --> 01:03:14,950
A little piece of advice.

713
01:03:16,790 --> 01:03:18,220
You see an agent...

714
01:03:18,530 --> 01:03:20,820
...you do what we do.

715
01:03:21,160 --> 01:03:22,680
Run.

716
01:03:23,030 --> 01:03:24,760
You run your ass off.

717
01:03:32,040 --> 01:03:33,700
Thanks for the drink.

718
01:03:38,450 --> 01:03:39,600
Sweet dreams.

719
01:03:43,620 --> 01:03:47,050
Do we have a deal, Mr. Reagan?

720
01:03:47,720 --> 01:03:48,850
You know...

721
01:03:50,320 --> 01:03:52,690
...I know this steak doesn't exist.

722
01:03:53,730 --> 01:03:56,490
I know that when I put it in my mouth...

723
01:03:56,700 --> 01:03:59,760
...the Matrix is telling my brain that it is...

724
01:04:00,100 --> 01:04:01,260
...juicy...

725
01:04:01,530 --> 01:04:03,230
...and delicious.

726
01:04:06,140 --> 01:04:07,370
After nine years...

727
01:04:08,440 --> 01:04:09,960
...you know what I realize?

728
01:04:17,820 --> 01:04:19,040
Ignorance is bliss.

729
01:04:24,060 --> 01:04:25,890
Then we have a deal.

730
01:04:28,430 --> 01:04:30,400
I don't want to remember nothing.

731
01:04:30,600 --> 01:04:31,430
Nothing.

732
01:04:31,930 --> 01:04:33,090
You understand?

733
01:04:37,140 --> 01:04:38,970
And I want to be rich.

734
01:04:40,310 --> 01:04:43,000
You know, someone important.

735
01:04:44,480 --> 01:04:45,600
Like an actor.

736
01:04:46,850 --> 01:04:49,940
Whatever you want, Mr. Reagan.

737
01:04:52,190 --> 01:04:53,670
Okay.

738
01:04:54,050 --> 01:04:56,490
You get my body back in a power plant...

739
01:04:56,860 --> 01:04:58,620
...reinsert me into the Matrix...

740
01:04:58,960 --> 01:05:00,360
...I'll get you what you want.

741
01:05:00,440 --> 01:05:02,800
Access codes to the Zion mainframe.

742
01:05:02,860 --> 01:05:05,020
No. I told you, I don't know them.

743
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:09,970
I can get you the man who does.

744
01:05:10,700 --> 01:05:12,530
Morpheus.

745
01:05:22,680 --> 01:05:26,120
Here you go, buddy. Breakfast of champions.

746
01:05:27,420 --> 01:05:30,290
Close your eyes, it feels like you're eating runny eggs.

747
01:05:30,360 --> 01:05:32,020
Or a bowl of snot.

748
01:05:32,660 --> 01:05:34,320
You know what it reminds me of?

749
01:05:36,060 --> 01:05:38,460
Tastee Wheat. Did you ever eat Tastee Wheat?

750
01:05:39,060 --> 01:05:40,790
No, but technically, neither did you.

751
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:43,060
That's exactly my point. Exactly.

752
01:05:43,300 --> 01:05:44,700
Because you have to wonder...

753
01:05:44,900 --> 01:05:48,300
...how do the machines really know what Tastee Wheat tasted like?

754
01:05:48,470 --> 01:05:49,910
Maybe they got it wrong.

755
01:05:50,110 --> 01:05:53,340
Maybe what I think Tastee Wheat tasted like actually tasted like...

756
01:05:53,510 --> 01:05:55,700
...oatmeal or tuna fish.

757
01:05:56,010 --> 01:05:58,880
That makes you wonder. Take chicken, for example.

758
01:05:59,080 --> 01:06:01,140
Maybe they didn't know what to make it taste like...

759
01:06:01,350 --> 01:06:03,450
...which is why it tastes like everything.

760
01:06:03,660 --> 01:06:05,450
And maybe they... Shut up.

761
01:06:07,060 --> 01:06:08,550
It's a single-celled protein...

762
01:06:08,760 --> 01:06:11,820
...combined with synthetic aminos, vitamins and minerals.

763
01:06:12,030 --> 01:06:13,330
Everything the body needs.

764
01:06:13,530 --> 01:06:16,400
It doesn't have everything the body needs.

765
01:06:19,200 --> 01:06:22,260
I understand you've run through the agent training program.

766
01:06:23,340 --> 01:06:25,370
You know, I wrote that program.

767
01:06:25,610 --> 01:06:27,010
Here it comes.

768
01:06:27,210 --> 01:06:29,180
What did you think of her? Of who?

769
01:06:29,550 --> 01:06:32,570
The woman in the red dress. I designed her.

770
01:06:32,880 --> 01:06:35,720
She doesn't talk very much...

771
01:06:35,810 --> 01:06:39,810
...but if you'd like to meet her, I can arrange a more personal milieu.

772
01:06:39,930 --> 01:06:41,560
The digital pimp hard at work.

773
01:06:41,760 --> 01:06:44,060
Pay no attention to these hypocrites, Neo.

774
01:06:45,360 --> 01:06:47,230
To deny our own impulses...

775
01:06:47,430 --> 01:06:50,560
...is to deny the very thing that makes us human.

776
01:06:52,470 --> 01:06:53,830
Dozer, when you're done...

777
01:06:54,070 --> 01:06:55,500
...bring the ship up to broadcast depth.

778
01:06:56,170 --> 01:06:57,570
We're going in.

779
01:06:58,240 --> 01:06:59,670
I'm taking Neo to see her.

780
01:07:04,010 --> 01:07:04,840
See who?

781
01:07:05,880 --> 01:07:07,110
The Oracle.

782
01:07:12,590 --> 01:07:14,150
Everyone please observe...

783
01:07:14,490 --> 01:07:17,190
...the "fasten seat belt" and "no smoking" signs are on.

784
01:07:17,730 --> 01:07:21,090
Sit back and enjoy your flight.

785
01:07:46,090 --> 01:07:47,300
We're in.

786
01:08:02,240 --> 01:08:03,330
We'll be back in an hour.

787
01:08:18,190 --> 01:08:19,550
Unbelievable...

788
01:08:20,360 --> 01:08:21,720
...isn't it?

789
01:08:25,300 --> 01:08:27,190
God! What?

790
01:08:27,830 --> 01:08:29,230
I used to eat there.

791
01:08:30,470 --> 01:08:33,080
Really good noodles.

792
01:08:36,910 --> 01:08:40,330
I have these memories from my life.

793
01:08:42,850 --> 01:08:44,540
None of them happened.

794
01:08:45,404 --> 01:08:46,334
What does that mean?

795
01:08:46,534 --> 01:08:48,764
That the Matrix cannot tell you who you are.

796
01:08:49,304 --> 01:08:50,864
But an oracle can?

797
01:08:50,974 --> 01:08:52,564
That's different.

798
01:08:57,684 --> 01:08:58,544
Did you go to her?

799
01:09:00,084 --> 01:09:01,244
Yes.

800
01:09:01,784 --> 01:09:03,114
What did she tell you?

801
01:09:06,394 --> 01:09:07,884
She told me...

802
01:09:08,964 --> 01:09:10,114
What?

803
01:09:13,894 --> 01:09:15,194
We're here.

804
01:09:15,504 --> 01:09:17,924
Come with me.

805
01:09:37,884 --> 01:09:40,514
So, is this the same oracle that made...

806
01:09:40,894 --> 01:09:41,784
...the prophecy?

807
01:09:41,994 --> 01:09:45,954
Yes. She's very old. She's been with us since the beginning.

808
01:09:46,494 --> 01:09:50,214
The beginning? Of the resistens.

809
01:09:51,034 --> 01:09:53,364
And she knows what? Everything?

810
01:09:55,404 --> 01:09:58,304
She would say she knows enough.

811
01:09:58,504 --> 01:10:00,234
Then she's never wrong.

812
01:10:02,474 --> 01:10:05,644
Try not to think of it in terms of right and wrong.

813
01:10:06,014 --> 01:10:07,574
She is a guide, Neo.

814
01:10:07,954 --> 01:10:09,814
She can help you to find the path.

815
01:10:10,654 --> 01:10:11,584
She helped you?

816
01:10:11,644 --> 01:10:13,044
Yes.

817
01:10:14,054 --> 01:10:15,424
What did she tell you?

818
01:10:17,894 --> 01:10:22,114
That I would find the One.

819
01:10:33,244 --> 01:10:35,334
I told you I can only show you the door.

820
01:10:36,044 --> 01:10:38,104
You have to walk through it.

821
01:10:41,954 --> 01:10:43,044
Hello, Neo.

822
01:10:43,224 --> 01:10:44,944
You're right on time.

823
01:10:51,824 --> 01:10:56,654
Make yourself at home, Morpheus. Neo, come with me.

824
01:11:02,274 --> 01:11:03,934
These are the other Potentials.

825
01:11:04,144 --> 01:11:05,734
You can wait here.

826
01:11:46,374 --> 01:11:49,224
Do not try and bend the spoon.

827
01:11:49,724 --> 01:11:50,984
That's impossible.

828
01:11:52,614 --> 01:11:56,444
Instead, only try to realize the truth.

829
01:11:56,824 --> 01:11:57,804
What truth?

830
01:11:58,614 --> 01:12:00,364
There is no spoon.

831
01:12:02,834 --> 01:12:04,064
There is no spoon?

832
01:12:04,194 --> 01:12:08,964
Then you'll see that it is not the spoon that bends. It is only yourself.

833
01:12:25,214 --> 01:12:27,574
The Oracle will you see now.

834
01:12:37,294 --> 01:12:38,334
I know you're Neo.

835
01:12:39,214 --> 01:12:40,244
Be right with you.

836
01:12:41,124 --> 01:12:42,944
You are the Oracle?

837
01:12:43,044 --> 01:12:43,944
Bingo!

838
01:12:46,234 --> 01:12:48,804
Not guite what you were expecting, right?

839
01:12:50,934 --> 01:12:52,784
Almost done.

840
01:12:55,204 --> 01:12:56,914
Smell good, don't they?

841
01:12:58,774 --> 01:12:59,274
Ya.

842
01:12:59,364 --> 01:13:01,244
I'd ask you to sit down...

843
01:13:01,914 --> 01:13:04,314
...but you're not going to do anything.

844
01:13:04,784 --> 01:13:06,614
And don't worry about the vase.

845
01:13:06,854 --> 01:13:07,644
What vase?

846
01:13:10,284 --> 01:13:11,484
That vase.

847
01:13:12,454 --> 01:13:13,484
I'm sorry.

848
01:13:13,724 --> 01:13:16,294
I said, don't worry about it.

849
01:13:16,794 --> 01:13:18,764
I'll get one of my kids to fix it.

850
01:13:19,294 --> 01:13:20,564
How did you know?

851
01:13:22,564 --> 01:13:26,434
What's really going to bake your noodle later on is...

852
01:13:26,774 --> 01:13:29,674
...would you still have broken it if I hadn't said anything?

853
01:13:34,514 --> 01:13:36,414
You're cuter than I thought.

854
01:13:39,454 --> 01:13:41,714
I can see why she likes you.

855
01:13:42,624 --> 01:13:43,674
Who?

856
01:13:43,924 --> 01:13:45,754
Not too bright, though.

857
01:13:49,024 --> 01:13:51,224
You know why Morpheus brought you to see me.

858
01:13:54,234 --> 01:13:55,464
So...

859
01:13:56,404 --> 01:13:57,764
...what do you think?

860
01:13:59,634 --> 01:14:01,334
Do you think you are the One?

861
01:14:03,274 --> 01:14:04,334
I don't know.

862
01:14:07,774 --> 01:14:09,174
You know what that means?

863
01:14:10,014 --> 01:14:11,174
It's Latin.

864
01:14:11,554 --> 01:14:13,814
Means, "Know thyself."

865
01:14:15,224 --> 01:14:17,184
I'll let you in on a little secret.

866
01:14:19,454 --> 01:14:23,294
Being the One is just like being in love.

867
01:14:23,924 --> 01:14:26,894
No one can tell you you're in love. You just know it...

868
01:14:27,094 --> 01:14:28,194
...through and through.

869
01:14:28,604 --> 01:14:30,624
Balls to bones.

870
01:14:33,174 --> 01:14:34,004
Well...

871
01:14:35,944 --> 01:14:38,034
...I'd better have a look at you.

872
01:14:39,374 --> 01:14:40,864
Open your mouth. Say, "Ah."

873
01:14:55,224 --> 01:14:56,924
Okay...

874
01:14:57,564 --> 01:15:02,504
Now I'm supposed to say, "Hmm, that's interesting, but..."

875
01:15:03,004 --> 01:15:04,124
Then you say...

876
01:15:05,004 --> 01:15:06,024
..."but what?"

877
01:15:06,274 --> 01:15:10,204
But you already know what I'm going to tell you.

878
01:15:11,674 --> 01:15:12,674
I'm not the One.

879
01:15:12,914 --> 01:15:14,644
Sorry, kid.

880
01:15:15,414 --> 01:15:17,414
You got the gift,

881
01:15:19,214 --> 01:15:21,414
...but it looks like you're waiting for something.

882
01:15:26,354 --> 01:15:27,184
What?

883
01:15:27,394 --> 01:15:30,294
Your next life, maybe. Who knows?

884
01:15:30,864 --> 01:15:33,124
That's the way these things go.

885
01:15:33,994 --> 01:15:34,864
What's funny?

886
01:15:34,864 --> 01:15:36,634
Morpheus.

887
01:15:36,654 --> 01:15:37,754
He...

888
01:15:40,034 --> 01:15:41,834
He almost had me convinced.

889
01:15:42,004 --> 01:15:43,094
I know.

890
01:15:44,744 --> 01:15:46,834
Poor Morpheus.

891
01:15:49,184 --> 01:15:52,304
Without him, we're lost.

892
01:15:53,914 --> 01:15:56,044
What do you mean, "without him"?

893
01:15:59,994 --> 01:16:01,924
Are you sure you want to hear this?

894
01:16:04,124 --> 01:16:06,924
Morpheus believes in you, Neo.

895
01:16:08,664 --> 01:16:10,864
And no one, not you, not even me...

896
01:16:11,034 --> 01:16:13,304
...can convince him otherwise.

897
01:16:13,674 --> 01:16:16,074
He believes it so blindly...

898
01:16:16,344 --> 01:16:20,714
...that he's going to sacrifice his life to save yours.

899
01:16:20,914 --> 01:16:21,774
What?

900
01:16:21,944 --> 01:16:24,884
You're going to have to make a choice.

901
01:16:25,554 --> 01:16:29,044
In the one hand, you'll have Morpheus' life.

902
01:16:29,654 --> 01:16:32,454
And in the other hand, you'll have your own.

903
01:16:33,924 --> 01:16:36,184
One of you is going to die.

904
01:16:38,294 --> 01:16:41,564
Which one... will be up to you.

905
01:16:42,934 --> 01:16:44,904
I'm sorry, kiddo. I really am.

906
01:16:45,074 --> 01:16:46,794
You have a good soul.

907
01:16:47,904 --> 01:16:50,634
And I hate giving good people bad news.

908
01:16:53,744 --> 01:16:55,144
Don't worry about it.

909
01:16:55,414 --> 01:16:57,884
As soon as you step outside that door...

910
01:16:58,114 --> 01:17:00,204
...you'll start feeling better.

911
01:17:00,954 --> 01:17:04,754
You'll remember you don't believe in any of this fate crap.

912
01:17:05,524 --> 01:17:08,324
You're in control of your own life.

913
01:17:09,124 --> 01:17:10,424
Remember?

914
01:17:11,904 --> 01:17:13,004
Here...

915
01:17:15,164 --> 01:17:16,754
...take a cookie.

916
01:17:17,304 --> 01:17:20,634
I promise, by the time you're done eating it...

917
01:17:21,604 --> 01:17:23,934
...you'll feel right as rain.

918
01:17:33,114 --> 01:17:34,514
What was said...

919
01:17:35,084 --> 01:17:36,614
...was for you...

920
01:17:37,084 --> 01:17:38,924
...and for you alone.

921
01:17:52,414 --> 01:17:53,714


922
01:18:01,844 --> 01:18:02,974
They're on the way.

923
01:18:33,044 --> 01:18:33,904
What is that?

924
01:18:48,624 --> 01:18:50,024
Whoa, deja vu.

925
01:18:53,564 --> 01:18:54,694
What did you just say?

926
01:18:54,904 --> 01:18:56,364
Nothing. Just had deja vu.

927
01:18:56,604 --> 01:18:58,224
What did you see? What happened?

928
01:18:59,704 --> 01:19:01,894
A black cat went past us...

929
01:19:02,074 --> 01:19:03,734
...then another just like it.

930
01:19:03,904 --> 01:19:05,464
Was it the same cat?

931
01:19:06,714 --> 01:19:07,644
I'm not sure.

932
01:19:08,484 --> 01:19:09,314
Switch, Apoc.

933
01:19:13,784 --> 01:19:14,614
What is it?

934
01:19:14,854 --> 01:19:19,254
A deja vu is usually a glitch in the Matrix. It happens when they change something.

935
01:19:22,624 --> 01:19:23,454
Oh, my God.

936
01:19:25,294 --> 01:19:26,224
Let's go.

937
01:19:31,504 --> 01:19:33,304
They cut the hard line. It's a trap! Get out!

938
01:19:39,174 --> 01:19:40,004
Oh, no.

939
01:20:20,384 --> 01:20:22,874
That's what they changed. We're trapped.

940
01:20:23,084 --> 01:20:25,024
Be calm. Give me your phone.

941
01:20:25,224 --> 01:20:26,714
They'll be able to track it.

942
01:20:26,714 --> 01:20:27,424
We have no choice.

943
01:20:28,864 --> 01:20:30,904
Operator. Tank

944
01:20:31,024 --> 01:20:34,234
Find a structural drawing of this building. Find it fast.

945
01:20:41,474 --> 01:20:44,564
Got it! I need the main wet-wall.

946
01:20:47,374 --> 01:20:48,644
Eighth floor.

947
01:20:48,944 --> 01:20:50,474
They're on the eighth floor.

948
01:20:50,844 --> 01:20:52,284
Switch, straight ahead.

949
01:20:52,894 --> 01:20:53,894
Neo

950
01:21:00,294 --> 01:21:02,484
I hope the Oracle gave you some good news.

951
01:21:10,704 --> 01:21:12,224
Now left. That's it.

952
01:21:12,364 --> 01:21:13,264
Good.

953
01:21:23,284 --> 01:21:24,614
Where are they?

954
01:22:25,044 --> 01:22:26,164
They're in the walls.

955
01:22:27,674 --> 01:22:28,774
In the walls!

956
01:22:50,234 --> 01:22:51,034
It's an agent!

957
01:22:59,104 --> 01:23:00,004
Morpheus

958
01:23:00,874 --> 01:23:01,844
You must get Neo out!

959
01:23:02,144 --> 01:23:04,044
He's all that matters!

960
01:23:04,344 --> 01:23:05,504
No, Morpheus! Don't!

961
01:23:05,754 --> 01:23:06,544
Trinity, go!

962
01:23:07,454 --> 01:23:08,814
Go!

963
01:23:15,094 --> 01:23:17,024
We can't leave him! We have to!

964
01:23:42,324 --> 01:23:43,114
Come on!

965
01:23:46,424 --> 01:23:52,154
The great Morpheus. We meet at last.

966
01:23:52,494 --> 01:23:54,024
And you are?

967
01:23:54,164 --> 01:23:55,494
A Smith.

968
01:23:55,534 --> 01:23:57,164
Agent Smith.

969
01:23:57,884 --> 01:23:59,184
You all look the same to me.

970
01:24:55,364 --> 01:24:56,654
Take him.

971
01:25:03,394 --> 01:25:04,194
No!

972
01:25:09,874 --> 01:25:11,704
Operator. I need an exit, fast.

973
01:25:11,934 --> 01:25:12,934
Cypher. Yeah.

974
01:25:13,814 --> 01:25:16,674
There was an accident. Goddamn car accident.

975
01:25:16,984 --> 01:25:18,844
All of a sudden, boom.

976
01:25:19,014 --> 01:25:20,504
Somebody up there still likes me.

977
01:25:20,714 --> 01:25:21,914
I got you.

978
01:25:22,484 --> 01:25:24,384
Just get me out of here fast.

979
01:25:24,654 --> 01:25:27,284
Nearest exit, Franklin and Erie. An old TV repair shop.

980
01:25:27,494 --> 01:25:28,584
Right.

981
01:25:31,694 --> 01:25:33,324
Operator. Tank, it's me.

982
01:25:33,534 --> 01:25:34,724
Is Morpheus alive?

983
01:25:35,094 --> 01:25:36,394
Is Morpheus alive, Tank?

984
01:25:36,764 --> 01:25:38,494
Yes. They're moving him. I don't know where to yet.

985
01:25:38,904 --> 01:25:41,264
He's alive. We need an exit.

986
01:25:41,474 --> 01:25:42,434
You're not far from Cypher.

987
01:25:42,644 --> 01:25:43,974
Cypher? I know.

988
01:25:44,204 --> 01:25:46,264
I sent him to Franklin and Erie. Got it.

989
01:25:55,384 --> 01:25:56,614
Got him.

990
01:26:07,564 --> 01:26:08,584
Where are they?

991
01:26:08,804 --> 01:26:10,024
Making the call.

992
01:26:10,764 --> 01:26:11,894
Good.

993
01:26:25,454 --> 01:26:26,284
You first, Neo.

994
01:26:29,484 --> 01:26:30,314
Shit!

995
01:26:39,434 --> 01:26:41,594
I don't know. It just went dead.

996
01:27:08,354 --> 01:27:09,584
Hello, Trinity.

997
01:27:09,994 --> 01:27:11,324
Cypher? Where's Tank?

998
01:27:16,904 --> 01:27:17,954
You know...

999
01:27:19,674 --> 01:27:21,794
...for a long time...

1000
01:27:22,974 --> 01:27:25,904
...I thought I was in love with you.

1001
01:27:26,714 --> 01:27:28,734
I used to dream about you.

1002
01:27:29,844 --> 01:27:32,614
You're a beautiful woman, Trinity.

1003
01:27:32,814 --> 01:27:35,144
Too bad things had to turn out this way.

1004
01:27:35,924 --> 01:27:36,754
You killed them.

1005
01:27:37,254 --> 01:27:38,814
What? Oh, God.

1006
01:27:38,994 --> 01:27:40,424
I'm tired, Trinity.

1007
01:27:41,854 --> 01:27:43,694
I'm tired of this war...

1008
01:27:43,994 --> 01:27:46,824
...tired of fighting. I'm tired of this ship...

1009
01:27:47,164 --> 01:27:51,824
...of being cold, of eating the same goddamn goop every day.

1010
01:27:54,174 --> 01:27:55,104
But most of all...

1011
01:27:55,744 --> 01:27:59,074
...I'm tired of that jackoff and all of his bullshit.

1012
01:28:00,244 --> 01:28:01,504
Surprise, asshole!

1013
01:28:02,044 --> 01:28:05,544
I bet you never saw this coming...

1014
01:28:07,884 --> 01:28:10,254
God, I wish I could be there...

1015
01:28:10,824 --> 01:28:12,344
...when they break you.

1016
01:28:13,394 --> 01:28:16,514
I wish I could walk in just when it happens...

1017
01:28:17,264 --> 01:28:18,954
...so right then...

1018
01:28:19,164 --> 01:28:21,024
...you'd know it was me.

1019
01:28:21,264 --> 01:28:22,774
You gave them Morpheus.

1020
01:28:22,784 --> 01:28:23,924
He lied to us, Trinity.

1021
01:28:24,504 --> 01:28:25,994
He tricked us!

1022
01:28:26,534 --> 01:28:28,594
If you had told us the truth...

1023
01:28:28,804 --> 01:28:31,704
...we would've told you to shove that red pill up your ass!

1024
01:28:31,904 --> 01:28:34,074
That is not true, Cypher. He set us free.

1025
01:28:34,314 --> 01:28:35,274
"Free."

1026
01:28:35,484 --> 01:28:37,144
You call this "free"?

1027
01:28:39,614 --> 01:28:42,054
All I do is what he tells me to do.

1028
01:28:43,724 --> 01:28:46,624
If I had to choose between that and the Matrix...

1029
01:28:47,754 --> 01:28:49,024
...I choose the Matrix.

1030
01:28:49,224 --> 01:28:50,924
The Matrix isn't real.

1031
01:28:51,164 --> 01:28:52,624
I disagree, Trinity.

1032
01:28:52,834 --> 01:28:55,064
I think the Matrix...

1033
01:28:55,434 --> 01:28:57,954
...can be more real than this world.

1034
01:29:00,174 --> 01:29:02,694
All I do is pull the plug here...

1035
01:29:03,244 --> 01:29:04,204
...but there...

1036
01:29:04,804 --> 01:29:07,034
...you have to watch Apoc die.

1037
01:29:08,744 --> 01:29:09,744
Trinity

1038
01:29:14,884 --> 01:29:16,514
Welcome to the real world.

1039
01:29:16,924 --> 01:29:17,814
But you're out.

1040
01:29:17,984 --> 01:29:20,514
You can't go back. That's what you think.

1041
01:29:20,724 --> 01:29:22,244
They'll reinsert my body.

1042
01:29:22,494 --> 01:29:26,124
I go back to sleep. When I wake up, I won't remember a thing.

1043
01:29:27,634 --> 01:29:30,564
By the way, if you have anything important to say to Switch...

1044
01:29:31,004 --> 01:29:32,124
...say it now.

1045
01:29:32,374 --> 01:29:33,234
No, please don't.

1046
01:29:33,834 --> 01:29:35,464
Not like this.

1047
01:29:37,144 --> 01:29:38,804
Not like this.

1048
01:29:43,244 --> 01:29:44,274
Too late.

1049
01:29:44,774 --> 01:29:46,504
Goddamn you, Cypher!

1050
01:29:46,714 --> 01:29:48,614
Don't hate me, Trinity.

1051
01:29:48,954 --> 01:29:50,884
I'm just a messenger.

1052
01:29:51,214 --> 01:29:54,384
And right now, I'm going to prove it to you.

1053
01:29:55,524 --> 01:29:57,154
If Morpheus was right...

1054
01:29:57,754 --> 01:29:59,624
...there's no way I can pull this plug.

1055
01:30:00,194 --> 01:30:01,684
If Neo's the One...

1056
01:30:02,164 --> 01:30:04,024
...then there'd have to be...

1057
01:30:04,234 --> 01:30:06,894
...some kind of a miracle to stop me.

1058
01:30:07,364 --> 01:30:08,234
Right?

1059
01:30:08,904 --> 01:30:10,994
I mean, how can he be the One...

1060
01:30:11,274 --> 01:30:12,204
...if he's dead?

1061
01:30:13,604 --> 01:30:15,834
You never did answer me before...

1062
01:30:16,114 --> 01:30:18,444
...if you bought into Morpheus' bullshit.

1063
01:30:18,844 --> 01:30:22,044
Come on. All I want is a little yes or no.

1064
01:30:23,384 --> 01:30:25,784
Look into his eyes...

1065
01:30:26,454 --> 01:30:29,174
...those big, pretty eyes...

1066
01:30:30,724 --> 01:30:32,054
...and tell me...

1067
01:30:32,794 --> 01:30:34,054
...yes...

1068
01:30:34,394 --> 01:30:35,794
...or no.

1069
01:30:37,034 --> 01:30:38,154
Yes.

1070
01:30:38,164 --> 01:30:38,654
No!

1071
01:30:39,004 --> 01:30:39,964
I don't believe it.

1072
01:30:41,304 --> 01:30:46,104
Believe it or not, you piece of shit, you're still going to burn!

1073
01:31:04,824 --> 01:31:05,794
You first.

1074
01:31:14,004 --> 01:31:14,834
You're hurt.

1075
01:31:15,164 --> 01:31:16,224
I'll be all right.

1076
01:31:19,044 --> 01:31:20,204
Dozer?

1077
01:31:38,424 --> 01:31:41,464
Have you ever stood and stared at it?

1078
01:31:41,764 --> 01:31:44,854
Marveled at its beauty...

1079
01:31:45,234 --> 01:31:47,494
...its genius?

1080
01:31:48,704 --> 01:31:50,534
Billions of people...

1081
01:31:50,804 --> 01:31:53,504
...just living out their lives...

1082
01:31:54,604 --> 01:31:56,234
...oblivious.

1083
01:32:00,844 --> 01:32:03,744
Did you know that the first Matrix...

1084
01:32:03,984 --> 01:32:08,644
...was designed to be a perfect human world where none suffered...

1085
01:32:09,154 --> 01:32:12,054
...where everyone would be happy.

1086
01:32:12,624 --> 01:32:14,114
It was a disaster.

1087
01:32:14,324 --> 01:32:18,734
No one would accept the program. Entire crops were lost.

1088
01:32:19,534 --> 01:32:21,334
Some believe that...

1089
01:32:21,534 --> 01:32:25,994
...we lacked the programming language to describe your perfect world.

1090
01:32:26,174 --> 01:32:27,764
But I believe that...

1091
01:32:28,174 --> 01:32:29,304
...as a species...

1092
01:32:29,344 --> 01:32:33,174
...human beings define their reality through misery...

1093
01:32:33,414 --> 01:32:34,814
...and suffering.

1094
01:32:35,044 --> 01:32:37,774
So the perfect world was a dream...

1095
01:32:37,984 --> 01:32:42,854
...that your primitive cerebrum kept trying to wake up from.

1096
01:32:44,124 --> 01:32:47,894
Which is why the Matrix was redesigned to this.

1097
01:32:48,294 --> 01:32:49,854
The peak...

1098
01:32:50,034 --> 01:32:51,464
...of your civilization.

1099
01:32:51,694 --> 01:32:54,034
I say "your civilization"...

1100
01:32:54,234 --> 01:32:58,394
...because when we started thinking for you, it became our civilization...

1101
01:32:58,604 --> 01:33:01,734
...which is, of course, what this is all about.

1102
01:33:03,044 --> 01:33:05,604
Evolution, Morpheus.

1103
01:33:05,944 --> 01:33:07,204
Evolution.

1104
01:33:09,484 --> 01:33:11,344
Like the dinosaur.

1105
01:33:13,524 --> 01:33:15,184
Look out that window.

1106
01:33:15,954 --> 01:33:18,044
You had your time.

1107
01:33:18,754 --> 01:33:22,624
The future is our world, Morpheus.

1108
01:33:23,034 --> 01:33:25,394
The future is our time.

1109
01:33:29,634 --> 01:33:30,794
There could be a problem.

1110
01:33:31,774 --> 01:33:35,104
What are they doing to him? They're breaking into his mind.

1111
01:33:35,104 --> 01:33:37,534
It's like hacking a computer. All it takes is time.

1112
01:33:37,774 --> 01:33:39,004
How much time?

1113
01:33:39,244 --> 01:33:42,374
Depends on the mind. But eventually, it'll crack...

1114
01:33:42,584 --> 01:33:47,074
...and his alpha patterns will change from this to this.

1115
01:33:47,284 --> 01:33:50,254
When it does, he'll tell them anything they want to know.

1116
01:33:50,454 --> 01:33:51,584
What do they want?

1117
01:33:51,824 --> 01:33:55,854
The leader of every ship is given codes to Zion's mainframe computer.

1118
01:33:56,144 --> 01:33:59,144
If an agent got the codes and got into Zion's mainframe...

1119
01:33:59,204 --> 01:34:02,294
...they could destroy us. We can't let that happen.

1120
01:34:02,584 --> 01:34:05,764
Trinity, Zion's more important than me or you...

1121
01:34:06,274 --> 01:34:07,504
...or even Morpheus.

1122
01:34:11,344 --> 01:34:13,044
There has to be something we can do.

1123
01:34:13,494 --> 01:34:15,794
Yes, we pull the plug.

1124
01:34:18,514 --> 01:34:20,284
You're going to kill him?

1125
01:34:20,484 --> 01:34:21,644
Kill Morpheus?

1126
01:34:22,254 --> 01:34:23,984
We don't have any other choice.

1127
01:34:30,144 --> 01:34:33,914
Never send a human to do a machine's job.

1128
01:34:33,934 --> 01:34:35,694
If the insider has failed...

1129
01:34:35,934 --> 01:34:39,284
...they'll sever the connection as soon as possible, unless...

1130
01:34:39,374 --> 01:34:41,104
They're dead. In either case...

1131
01:34:41,304 --> 01:34:44,934
We have no choice. Continue as planned. Deploy the sentinels.

1132
01:34:45,114 --> 01:34:46,174
Immediately.

1133
01:34:51,414 --> 01:34:54,114
Morpheus, you were more than a leader to us.

1134
01:34:55,084 --> 01:34:57,314
You were a father.

1135
01:34:58,824 --> 01:35:00,794
We'll miss you always.

1136
01:35:07,444 --> 01:35:08,244
Stop!

1137
01:35:10,074 --> 01:35:11,334
I don't believe this is happening.

1138
01:35:11,534 --> 01:35:13,564
Neo, this has to be done. Does it?

1139
01:35:14,374 --> 01:35:15,804
I don't know.

1140
01:35:16,114 --> 01:35:17,864
This can't be just coincidence.

1141
01:35:17,914 --> 01:35:18,704
What you are talking about?

1142
01:35:19,214 --> 01:35:20,074
The Oracle...

1143
01:35:20,284 --> 01:35:22,074
She told me this would happen.

1144
01:35:22,484 --> 01:35:26,644
She told me that I would have to make a choice.

1145
01:35:27,124 --> 01:35:28,314
What choice?

1146
01:35:31,354 --> 01:35:32,184
What are you doing?

1147
01:35:32,624 --> 01:35:33,884
I'm going in.

1148
01:35:34,124 --> 01:35:35,424
No, you're not.

1149
01:35:35,824 --> 01:35:36,524
I have to.

1150
01:35:36,734 --> 01:35:40,354
Neo, Morpheus sacrificed himself so that we could get you out.

1151
01:35:40,564 --> 01:35:42,504
There is no way that you're going back in.

1152
01:35:43,104 --> 01:35:46,664
Morpheus did what he did because he believed I'm something I'm not.

1153
01:35:48,244 --> 01:35:49,244
What?

1154
01:35:49,614 --> 01:35:51,034
I'm not the One, Trinity.

1155
01:35:51,044 --> 01:35:52,964
The Oracle hit me with that too.

1156
01:35:53,764 --> 01:35:54,764
No, you have to be.

1157
01:35:54,844 --> 01:35:57,474
I'm sorry, I'm not. I'm just another guy.

1158
01:35:58,114 --> 01:35:59,414
No, Neo, that's not true.

1159
01:36:00,024 --> 01:36:01,284
It can't be true.

1160
01:36:01,294 --> 01:36:01,874
Why?

1161
01:36:06,024 --> 01:36:10,494
Neo, this is loco. They've got Morpheus in a military-controlled building.

1162
01:36:10,594 --> 01:36:15,304
Even if you somehow got inside, those are agents holding him. Three of them.

1163
01:36:16,304 --> 01:36:20,204
I want Morpheus back too, but what you're talking about is suicide.

1164
01:36:20,404 --> 01:36:22,104
That's what it looks like...

1165
01:36:22,514 --> 01:36:25,944
But this is not, I can't explain to you why it's not.

1166
01:36:27,014 --> 01:36:30,744
Morpheus believed something, and he was ready to give his life for it.

1167
01:36:30,984 --> 01:36:34,014
I understand that now. That's why I have to go.

1168
01:36:34,184 --> 01:36:35,054
Why?

1169
01:36:35,224 --> 01:36:36,714
Because I believe in something.

1170
01:36:36,954 --> 01:36:37,754
What?

1171
01:36:39,224 --> 01:36:40,954
I believe I can bring him back.

1172
01:36:57,974 --> 01:36:58,944
What are you doing?

1173
01:36:58,944 --> 01:37:00,104
Going with you.

1174
01:37:00,144 --> 01:37:01,014
No, you're not.

1175
01:37:01,284 --> 01:37:02,144
"No"?

1176
01:37:03,314 --> 01:37:05,444
Let me tell you what I believe.

1177
01:37:05,954 --> 01:37:08,284
Morpheus means more to me than he does to you.

1178
01:37:08,654 --> 01:37:12,994
I believe if you are serious about saving him, you will need my help.

1179
01:37:13,164 --> 01:37:15,284
And since I am the ranking officer...

1180
01:37:15,494 --> 01:37:18,324
...if you don't like it, I believe you can go to hell.

1181
01:37:19,134 --> 01:37:21,494
Because you aren't going anywhere else.

1182
01:37:22,004 --> 01:37:22,794
Tank...

1183
01:37:23,604 --> 01:37:24,764
...load us up.

1184
01:37:34,384 --> 01:37:37,714
I'd like to share a revelation that I've had...

1185
01:37:38,084 --> 01:37:39,714
...during my time here.

1186
01:37:39,954 --> 01:37:44,014
It came to me when I tried to classify your species...

1187
01:37:44,194 --> 01:37:46,454
...and I realized...

1188
01:37:46,664 --> 01:37:48,994
...that you're not actually mammals.

1189
01:37:51,164 --> 01:37:53,634
Every mammal on this planet...

1190
01:37:54,034 --> 01:37:58,904
...instinctively develops an eguilibrium with the surrounding environment.

1191
01:37:59,104 --> 01:38:01,044
But you humans do not.

1192
01:38:01,544 --> 01:38:05,104
You move to an area, and you multiply...

1193
01:38:05,344 --> 01:38:09,784
...and multiply, until every natural resource is consumed.

1194
01:38:10,154 --> 01:38:12,244
The only way you can survive...

1195
01:38:12,484 --> 01:38:15,514
...is to spread to another area.

1196
01:38:20,894 --> 01:38:23,794
There is another organism on this planet...

1197
01:38:24,034 --> 01:38:26,054
...that follows the same pattern.

1198
01:38:26,634 --> 01:38:28,264
Do you know what it is?

1199
01:38:28,704 --> 01:38:30,464
A virus.

1200
01:38:31,804 --> 01:38:34,894
Human beings are a disease.

1201
01:38:35,274 --> 01:38:36,864
A cancer of this planet.

1202
01:38:37,074 --> 01:38:39,204
You are a plague.

1203
01:38:41,314 --> 01:38:42,714
...are the cure.

1204
01:38:43,684 --> 01:38:45,084
Okay, so what do you need?

1205
01:38:45,754 --> 01:38:46,874
Besides a miracle.

1206
01:38:47,454 --> 01:38:51,244
Guns. Lots of guns.

1207
01:39:00,534 --> 01:39:01,464
Neo,

1208
01:39:03,454 --> 01:39:05,554
No one has ever done anything like this.

1209
01:39:07,304 --> 01:39:09,174
That's why it's going to work.

1210
01:39:13,314 --> 01:39:15,214
Why isn't the serum working?

1211
01:39:15,844 --> 01:39:18,144
Perhaps we're asking the wrong guestions.

1212
01:39:20,254 --> 01:39:21,444
Leave me with him.

1213
01:39:24,094 --> 01:39:25,184
Now.

1214
01:39:36,404 --> 01:39:37,994
Hold on, Morpheus.

1215
01:39:38,204 --> 01:39:40,964
They're coming for you. They're coming.

1216
01:39:43,344 --> 01:39:45,504
Can you hear me, Morpheus?

1217
01:39:45,714 --> 01:39:48,374
I'm going to be honest...

1218
01:39:48,744 --> 01:39:49,904
...with you.

1219
01:39:54,354 --> 01:39:55,714
I...

1220
01:39:56,824 --> 01:39:57,794
...hate...

1221
01:39:57,994 --> 01:39:59,924
...this place...

1222
01:40:00,364 --> 01:40:02,654
...this zoo...

1223
01:40:02,894 --> 01:40:04,024
...this prison...

1224
01:40:04,234 --> 01:40:07,464
...this reality, whatever you want to call it.

1225
01:40:07,664 --> 01:40:09,964
I can't stand it any longer.

1226
01:40:10,734 --> 01:40:12,564
It's the smell.

1227
01:40:13,944 --> 01:40:15,844
If there is such a thing.

1228
01:40:16,214 --> 01:40:19,504
I feel saturated by it.

1229
01:40:20,944 --> 01:40:22,344
I can...

1230
01:40:22,544 --> 01:40:23,374
...taste...

1231
01:40:24,254 --> 01:40:26,314
...your stink.

1232
01:40:26,524 --> 01:40:30,284
And every time I do, I fear that I have somehow been infected by it.

1233
01:40:30,494 --> 01:40:31,324
It's repulsive.

1234
01:40:32,294 --> 01:40:33,724
Isn't it?

1235
01:40:35,894 --> 01:40:38,194
I must get out of here.

1236
01:40:38,564 --> 01:40:40,864
I must get free.

1237
01:40:41,034 --> 01:40:43,934
And in this mind is the key.

1238
01:40:44,204 --> 01:40:45,834
My key.

1239
01:40:46,034 --> 01:40:48,944
Once Zion is destroyed, there is no need for me to be here.

1240
01:40:49,204 --> 01:40:50,834
Do you understand?

1241
01:40:51,074 --> 01:40:52,544
I need the codes.

1242
01:40:52,774 --> 01:40:55,074
I have to get inside Zion...

1243
01:40:55,414 --> 01:40:57,944
...and you have to tell me how.

1244
01:40:58,314 --> 01:41:00,254
You're going to tell me...

1245
01:41:00,454 --> 01:41:02,614
...or you're going to die.

1246
01:41:22,104 --> 01:41:25,374
Please remove any metallic items you're carrying.

1247
01:41:25,474 --> 01:41:26,914
Keys, loose change.

1248
01:41:29,284 --> 01:41:31,284
Oh, shit!

1249
01:41:43,034 --> 01:41:43,964
Backup.

1250
01:41:44,134 --> 01:41:45,754
Send backup.

1251
01:42:09,754 --> 01:42:10,654
Freeze!

1252
01:44:25,754 --> 01:44:26,724
What were you doing?

1253
01:44:28,564 --> 01:44:29,894
He doesn't know.

1254
01:44:30,064 --> 01:44:31,584
Know what?

1255
01:44:59,694 --> 01:45:02,164
I think they're trying to save him.

1256
01:45:17,014 --> 01:45:18,774
There is no spoon.

1257
01:45:48,374 --> 01:45:50,574
Find them and destroy them!

1258
01:45:51,174 --> 01:45:55,044
I repeat, we are under attack!

1259
01:46:25,644 --> 01:46:26,644
Trinity

1260
01:46:50,904 --> 01:46:52,064
Only human.

1261
01:46:53,204 --> 01:46:54,104
Dodge this.

1262
01:47:07,384 --> 01:47:08,874
How did you do that? Do what?

1263
01:47:09,284 --> 01:47:13,194
You moved like they do. I've never seen anyone move that fast.

1264
01:47:14,324 --> 01:47:15,764
It wasn't fast enough.

1265
01:47:18,434 --> 01:47:19,794
Can you fly that thing?

1266
01:47:21,064 --> 01:47:21,934
Not yet.

1267
01:47:25,334 --> 01:47:26,164
Operator.

1268
01:47:26,374 --> 01:47:29,604
I need a pilot program for a B-212 helicopter.

1269
01:47:30,074 --> 01:47:31,334
Hurry.

1270
01:47:39,284 --> 01:47:40,914
Let's go.

1271
01:47:56,034 --> 01:47:57,094
No.

1272
01:48:48,684 --> 01:48:50,214
Morpheus, get up.

1273
01:48:50,494 --> 01:48:51,324
Get up, get up.

1274
01:49:29,324 --> 01:49:30,354
He's not going to make it.

1275
01:50:47,734 --> 01:50:48,734
Trinity

1276
01:51:30,114 --> 01:51:31,544
I knew it.

1277
01:51:32,354 --> 01:51:33,374
He's the One.

1278
01:51:49,304 --> 01:51:51,564
Do you believe it now, Trinity?

1279
01:51:54,184 --> 01:51:55,084
Morpheus

1280
01:51:57,514 --> 01:51:58,344
The Oracle...

1281
01:51:59,614 --> 01:52:01,974
She told me... She told you...

1282
01:52:02,384 --> 01:52:03,944
...what you needed to hear.

1283
01:52:04,254 --> 01:52:05,584
That's all.

1284
01:52:06,614 --> 01:52:09,584
Sooner or later you'll realize, just as I did...

1285
01:52:09,924 --> 01:52:12,224
...there's a difference between knowing the path...

1286
01:52:12,954 --> 01:52:14,754
...and walking the path.

1287
01:52:17,264 --> 01:52:18,454
Operator. Tank

1288
01:52:19,434 --> 01:52:22,064
It's good to hear your voice. We need an exit.

1289
01:52:22,234 --> 01:52:26,064
Got one ready. Subway station, State and Balboa.

1290
01:52:38,044 --> 01:52:38,844
Damn it!

1291
01:52:39,214 --> 01:52:40,514
The trace was completed.

1292
01:52:40,724 --> 01:52:41,654
We have their position.

1293
01:52:42,084 --> 01:52:44,284
Sentinels are standing by.

1294
01:52:46,054 --> 01:52:47,544
Order the strike.

1295
01:52:54,064 --> 01:52:56,094
They're not out yet.

1296
01:53:07,214 --> 01:53:08,574
You first, Morpheus.

1297
01:53:29,264 --> 01:53:31,564
Neo, I want to tell you something...

1298
01:53:34,804 --> 01:53:38,764
...but I'm afraid of what it could mean if I do.

1299
01:53:42,384 --> 01:53:45,684
Everything the Oracle told me has come true.

1300
01:53:48,454 --> 01:53:49,974
Everything but this.

1301
01:53:51,694 --> 01:53:52,524
But what?

1302
01:54:17,914 --> 01:54:18,314
Neo

1303
01:54:18,854 --> 01:54:20,514
What happened? An agent.

1304
01:54:20,724 --> 01:54:21,584
Send me back.

1305
01:54:21,784 --> 01:54:22,614
I can't.

1306
01:54:24,804 --> 01:54:26,204
Mr. Anderson.

1307
01:54:28,794 --> 01:54:30,224
Run, Neo. Run.

1308
01:54:35,534 --> 01:54:37,194
What is he doing?

1309
01:54:37,404 --> 01:54:38,664
He's beginning to believe.

1310
01:55:05,634 --> 01:55:07,064
You're empty.

1311
01:55:07,564 --> 01:55:08,894
So are you.

1312
01:55:42,064 --> 01:55:45,034
I'm going to enjoy watching you die...

1313
01:55:46,134 --> 01:55:47,194
...Mr. Anderson.

1314
01:56:28,184 --> 01:56:30,244
Jesus, he's killing him.

1315
01:57:56,434 --> 01:57:58,594
You hear that, Mr. Anderson?

1316
01:57:59,304 --> 01:58:02,274
That is the sound of inevitability.

1317
01:58:04,944 --> 01:58:08,274
It is the sound of your death.

1318
01:58:09,184 --> 01:58:11,514
Goodbye, Mr. Anderson.

1319
01:58:11,714 --> 01:58:13,414
My name...

1320
01:58:16,354 --> 01:58:18,414
...is Neo.

1321
01:58:50,694 --> 01:58:52,854
What happened? I don't know. I lost him.

1322
01:58:53,314 --> 01:58:54,914


1323
01:58:55,394 --> 01:58:56,454
Oh, shit.

1324
01:59:08,844 --> 01:59:10,244
Sentinels.

1325
01:59:11,044 --> 01:59:13,274
How long? Five, maybe six minutes.

1326
01:59:15,314 --> 01:59:17,474
Tank, charge the EMP.

1327
01:59:17,714 --> 01:59:20,774
We can't use that until he's out. I know, Trinity. Don't worry.

1328
01:59:22,154 --> 01:59:23,054
He's gonna make it.

1329
01:59:23,254 --> 01:59:25,124
Flat or pumps? No, just...

1330
01:59:25,424 --> 01:59:28,324
What the shit? That's my phone!

1331
01:59:28,724 --> 01:59:30,324
That guy took my phone!

1332
01:59:32,694 --> 01:59:33,524
Got him!

1333
01:59:33,764 --> 01:59:35,024
He's on the run.

1334
01:59:35,204 --> 01:59:36,064
Mr. Wizard...

1335
01:59:36,504 --> 01:59:37,934
...get me out of here!

1336
01:59:38,104 --> 01:59:40,034
I got an old exit. Wabash and Lake.

1337
01:59:44,074 --> 01:59:44,904
Oh, shit!

1338
02:00:06,534 --> 02:00:08,504
Help! Need a little help!

1339
02:00:10,134 --> 02:00:11,394
The door.

1340
02:00:27,384 --> 02:00:28,854
The door on your left.

1341
02:00:29,754 --> 02:00:31,054
Your other left!

1342
02:00:37,734 --> 02:00:39,194
The back door.

1343
02:00:58,474 --> 02:00:59,474


1344
02:00:59,714 --> 02:01:00,874
Oh, no.

1345
02:01:02,554 --> 02:01:04,044
Here they come.

1346
02:01:32,854 --> 02:01:34,084
He's going to make it.

1347
02:01:44,294 --> 02:01:47,424
The fire escape at the end of the alley, room 303.

1348
02:02:19,594 --> 02:02:21,594


1349
02:02:22,764 --> 02:02:23,634
They're inside.

1350
02:02:26,134 --> 02:02:27,004
Hurry, Neo.

1351
02:03:23,454 --> 02:03:24,454
It can't be.

1352
02:03:32,134 --> 02:03:33,534
Check him.

1353
02:03:37,574 --> 02:03:39,044
He's gone.

1354
02:03:45,814 --> 02:03:48,214
Goodbye, Mr. Anderson.

1355
02:03:55,944 --> 02:03:56,944
Neo,

1356
02:03:58,294 --> 02:04:00,264
I'm not afraid anymore.

1357
02:04:01,904 --> 02:04:06,164
The Oracle told me that I'd fall in love, and that the man I loved...

1358
02:04:07,034 --> 02:04:08,834
...would be the One.

1359
02:04:11,974 --> 02:04:13,914
So you see...

1360
02:04:14,614 --> 02:04:16,584
...you can't be dead.

1361
02:04:18,184 --> 02:04:20,014
You can't be...

1362
02:04:21,584 --> 02:04:23,744
...because I love you.

1363
02:04:25,624 --> 02:04:27,254
You hear me?

1364
02:04:28,394 --> 02:04:30,054
I love you.

1365
02:04:54,054 --> 02:04:55,074
Now, get up.

1366
02:05:04,124 --> 02:05:04,994
No.

1367
02:05:31,894 --> 02:05:32,724
How?

1368
02:05:33,624 --> 02:05:34,684
He is the One.

1369
02:07:59,134 --> 02:08:00,794
I know you're out there.

1370
02:08:01,074 --> 02:08:02,904
I can feel you now.

1371
02:08:03,344 --> 02:08:05,134
I know that you're afraid.

1372
02:08:05,374 --> 02:08:06,934
You're afraid of us.

1373
02:08:07,314 --> 02:08:09,104
You're afraid of change.

1374
02:08:09,314 --> 02:08:35,804


1375
02:08:09,314 --> 02:08:11,904
I don't know the future.

1376
02:08:12,084 --> 02:08:14,714
I didn't come here to tell you how this is going to end.

1377
02:08:14,954 --> 02:08:17,924
I came here to tell you how it's going to begin.

1378
02:08:18,824 --> 02:08:20,414
I'll hang up this phone.

1379
02:08:20,624 --> 02:08:23,824
And then I'll show these people what you don't want them to see.

1380
02:08:24,064 --> 02:08:25,924
I'm going to show them a world...

1381
02:08:26,094 --> 02:08:27,894
...without you.

1382
02:08:28,164 --> 02:08:31,864
A world without rules and controls, without borders or boundaries.

1383
02:08:32,074 --> 02:08:35,804
A world where anything is possible.

1384
02:08:38,414 --> 02:08:39,804
Where we go from there...

1385
02:08:40,014 --> 02:08:41,984
...is a choice I leave to you.
