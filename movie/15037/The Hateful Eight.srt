1
00:04:41,032 --> 00:04:43,201
Hyah! Huh!

2
00:04:43,326 --> 00:04:44,744
Get in there now!

3
00:04:44,869 --> 00:04:46,704
Get in! Get in!

4
00:04:46,829 --> 00:04:48,831
Get in there, Dude!

5
00:04:48,956 --> 00:04:49,999
Get in now!

6
00:04:50,124 --> 00:04:54,086
Hyah! Come on! Huh!

7
00:04:54,212 --> 00:04:56,964
All right! Huh!

8
00:04:57,089 --> 00:05:00,009
Huh!

9
00:05:00,134 --> 00:05:03,095
Whoa. Whoa.

10
00:05:03,221 --> 00:05:04,847
Whoa.

11
00:05:11,103 --> 00:05:13,397
Got room for one more?

12
00:05:13,523 --> 00:05:15,900
Who the hell are you?!

13
00:05:16,025 --> 00:05:17,735
And what happened to them?

14
00:05:20,112 --> 00:05:21,447
Name's Major Marquis Warren,

15
00:05:21,572 --> 00:05:23,199
former U.S. Cavalry.

16
00:05:23,324 --> 00:05:24,784
Currently a servant
of the court.

17
00:05:24,909 --> 00:05:27,620
Trying to bring a couple
no-goods into market.

18
00:05:27,745 --> 00:05:29,747
Got the paperwork on 'em
in my pocket.

19
00:05:29,872 --> 00:05:31,999
You takin' 'em into Red Rock?

20
00:05:32,124 --> 00:05:33,960
Figure that's where
you headed, right?

21
00:05:34,085 --> 00:05:35,336
I am.

22
00:05:35,461 --> 00:05:36,879
That damn blasted blizzard

23
00:05:37,004 --> 00:05:38,965
has been on our ass
for the last three hours.

24
00:05:40,967 --> 00:05:43,344
There ain't no way we gonna
make it all the way to Red Rock

25
00:05:43,469 --> 00:05:45,847
-'fore it catches us.
- So you hightailin' it halfway,

26
00:05:45,972 --> 00:05:47,098
to Minnie's Haberdashery?

27
00:05:47,223 --> 00:05:49,225
You know I am.

28
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:50,601
May I come aboard?

29
00:05:50,726 --> 00:05:52,728
Well, smoke,

30
00:05:52,854 --> 00:05:55,898
if it up to me, yes.

31
00:05:56,023 --> 00:05:57,984
But it ain't up to me.

32
00:05:58,109 --> 00:05:59,735
Who's it up to?

33
00:05:59,861 --> 00:06:01,571
Fella in the wagon.

34
00:06:01,696 --> 00:06:04,115
Fella in the wagon
ain't partial to company?

35
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,450
Fella in the wagon,
he paid for a private trip,

36
00:06:06,576 --> 00:06:08,119
and I'm hereto tell you,

37
00:06:08,244 --> 00:06:10,079
he paid a pretty penny
for privacy.

38
00:06:10,204 --> 00:06:12,999
So if you want to go
to Minnie's with us,

39
00:06:13,124 --> 00:06:15,334
you gonna have to talk to him.

40
00:06:15,459 --> 00:06:17,920
Well...

41
00:06:18,045 --> 00:06:20,339
that's what I'll do.

42
00:06:21,883 --> 00:06:24,927
Hold it, black fella.

43
00:06:25,052 --> 00:06:28,389
'Fore you approach,
you take them two guns of yours

44
00:06:28,514 --> 00:06:31,767
and you lay 'em on that rock
over yonder.

45
00:06:31,893 --> 00:06:36,355
Then you raise both your hands
way above your hat.

46
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,649
Then you approach.

47
00:06:38,774 --> 00:06:40,192
Molasses-like.

48
00:06:41,319 --> 00:06:43,404
Real trustin' fella, huh?

49
00:06:43,529 --> 00:06:45,364
Not so much.

50
00:06:57,835 --> 00:06:59,879
Put 'em down.

51
00:07:08,512 --> 00:07:10,389
Come on ahead.

52
00:07:10,514 --> 00:07:13,893
I said way above your hat,
goddamn it!

53
00:07:15,269 --> 00:07:17,939
Now come forward.

54
00:07:18,064 --> 00:07:19,857
That's far enough.

55
00:07:25,821 --> 00:07:27,740
Well, I'll be dogged.

56
00:07:27,865 --> 00:07:29,659
You a black fella I know.

57
00:07:29,784 --> 00:07:32,078
Colonel somethin'-or-other
Warren, right?

58
00:07:32,203 --> 00:07:35,122
Major Marquis Warren.

59
00:07:35,247 --> 00:07:36,999
I know you, too.

60
00:07:37,124 --> 00:07:39,085
We, uh, shared a steak dinner

61
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:41,170
once upon a time
in Chattanooga.

62
00:07:41,295 --> 00:07:43,089
You John Ruth The Hangman.

63
00:07:43,214 --> 00:07:44,674
That'd be me.

64
00:07:44,799 --> 00:07:46,008
How long's that been?

65
00:07:46,133 --> 00:07:47,510
Since that steak?

66
00:07:47,635 --> 00:07:50,763
Oh... eight months.

67
00:07:50,888 --> 00:07:53,349
So why don't you explain to me

68
00:07:53,474 --> 00:07:55,559
what a African
bounty hunter's doin'

69
00:07:55,685 --> 00:07:58,854
wanderin' around in the snow
in the middle of Wyoming?

70
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:00,898
Trying to get a couple
of bounties in to Red Rock.

71
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:02,191
So you still in business?

72
00:08:02,316 --> 00:08:03,776
You know I am.

73
00:08:03,901 --> 00:08:05,695
Happened to your horse?

74
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:09,073
Circumstances caused us to have
to take the long way round.

75
00:08:09,198 --> 00:08:11,117
- My horse couldn't make it.
- Mm.

76
00:08:11,242 --> 00:08:13,661
You don't know nothin'
'bout this filly here.

77
00:08:13,786 --> 00:08:15,204
Nope.

78
00:08:15,329 --> 00:08:17,581
- Don't even know her name?
- Nope.

79
00:08:17,707 --> 00:08:21,419
Well, I guess that makes this
one fortuitous wagon.

80
00:08:21,544 --> 00:08:23,462
I sure as hell hope so.

81
00:08:23,587 --> 00:08:27,174
Major Marquis Warren,
this here's Daisy Domergue.

82
00:08:28,676 --> 00:08:31,554
Domergue,
to you this is Major Warren.

83
00:08:31,679 --> 00:08:33,180
Howdy, nigger.

84
00:08:34,849 --> 00:08:36,684
She's a pepper, ain't she?

85
00:08:36,809 --> 00:08:38,644
Now, girl, don't you know
the darkies don't like

86
00:08:38,769 --> 00:08:39,937
being called niggers no more?

87
00:08:40,062 --> 00:08:41,272
They find it offensive.

88
00:08:41,397 --> 00:08:42,940
I been called worse.

89
00:08:43,065 --> 00:08:44,442
Flaughsy
Now, that I can believe.

90
00:08:44,567 --> 00:08:45,943
You never heard of her, huh?

91
00:08:46,068 --> 00:08:47,403
Should I?

92
00:08:47,528 --> 00:08:49,071
Well, she ain't no
John Wilkes Booth,

93
00:08:49,196 --> 00:08:51,073
but maybe you might heard tell

94
00:08:51,198 --> 00:08:53,034
about the price on her head.

95
00:08:53,159 --> 00:08:54,910
- HOW much?
- $10,000.

96
00:08:55,036 --> 00:08:56,620
Damn.

97
00:08:56,746 --> 00:08:59,081
What'd she do,
kill Lily Langtry?

98
00:08:59,206 --> 00:09:00,791
Not quite.

99
00:09:00,916 --> 00:09:03,794
That ten thousands practically
in my pocket.

100
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:07,298
It's why I ain't too anxious
to be handin' out rides,

101
00:09:07,423 --> 00:09:09,842
especially to professionals
open for business.

102
00:09:09,967 --> 00:09:11,469
I can certainly
appreciate that.

103
00:09:11,594 --> 00:09:14,430
But I ain't got no designs
on her.

104
00:09:14,555 --> 00:09:17,183
One of my fellas over there
is worth $4,000,

105
00:09:17,308 --> 00:09:20,352
another one's worth $3,000,
and one of 'em's worth $1,000.

106
00:09:20,478 --> 00:09:21,937
That's damn sure good enough
for me.

107
00:09:22,063 --> 00:09:26,067
Well...
let me see their paperwork.

108
00:09:26,192 --> 00:09:29,445
Like I said, molasses-like.

109
00:09:38,204 --> 00:09:39,288
Back off.

110
00:10:08,275 --> 00:10:10,319
Look, I sure hate
to interrupt you all,

111
00:10:10,444 --> 00:10:14,073
but we got a cold damn blizzard
that's hot on our ass

112
00:10:14,198 --> 00:10:15,991
that we're tryin' to beat
to shelter!

113
00:10:16,117 --> 00:10:18,536
I realize that!
Now, shut your mouth

114
00:10:18,661 --> 00:10:21,247
and hold them damn horses
while I think!

115
00:10:23,916 --> 00:10:26,377
Okay, boy, we'll give it a try.

116
00:10:26,502 --> 00:10:29,713
But you leave them two pistols
over yonder with the driver.

117
00:10:32,716 --> 00:10:35,052
Hey, uh, you ain't
really gonna let that nigger

118
00:10:35,177 --> 00:10:36,554
ride in here, is ya?

119
00:10:36,679 --> 00:10:38,055
I mean, maybe up there
with O.B., but...

120
00:10:40,224 --> 00:10:42,518
How ya like the sound
of them bells, bitch?

121
00:10:42,643 --> 00:10:44,019
They real pretty, ain't they?

122
00:10:45,521 --> 00:10:47,398
You open up
your trashy mouth again,

123
00:10:47,523 --> 00:10:49,275
I'll knock out them
front teeth for ya.

124
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,402
You got it?

125
00:10:51,527 --> 00:10:53,279
Yeah.

126
00:10:53,404 --> 00:10:55,531
Let me hear ya say, "I got it."

127
00:10:57,449 --> 00:11:00,077
I got it.

128
00:11:00,202 --> 00:11:03,455
Uh, I'm gonna need a hand tyin'
these fellas up on the roof.

129
00:11:03,581 --> 00:11:06,125
Give O.B. $50
when we get to Red Rock.

130
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:07,251
He'll help ya.

131
00:11:07,376 --> 00:11:08,878
Well, I agree with O.B.

132
00:11:09,003 --> 00:11:10,629
This storm got me concerned.

133
00:11:10,754 --> 00:11:12,923
We get goin' a lot quicker
you helped out, too.

134
00:11:13,048 --> 00:11:15,968
Goddamn it to hell,
I'm already regrettin' this.

135
00:11:16,093 --> 00:11:18,971
Now, I can't likely help you
tie fellas to the roof

136
00:11:19,096 --> 00:11:20,556
with my wrist cuffed to hers.

137
00:11:20,681 --> 00:11:22,474
And my wrist is gonna stay
cuffed to hers,

138
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,602
and she ain't never gonna
leave my goddamn side

139
00:11:24,727 --> 00:11:27,563
till I personally put her
in the Red Rock jail!

140
00:11:27,688 --> 00:11:29,315
Now, do you got that?!

141
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,066
Yeah, I got it.

142
00:11:31,192 --> 00:11:32,651
Good.

143
00:11:35,237 --> 00:11:36,864
Get in, Dude!

144
00:11:36,989 --> 00:11:38,407
Hut! Get in!

145
00:11:38,532 --> 00:11:41,285
Go on! Hut!

146
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:42,745
Come on!

147
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:46,457
Dude, Coconut, giddyup.

148
00:11:46,582 --> 00:11:47,917
Yam

149
00:12:14,526 --> 00:12:16,904
Hut!

150
00:12:21,492 --> 00:12:23,619
GiddyUP!

151
00:12:24,912 --> 00:12:27,289
Yah! Cimarron!
Leche! Get in!

152
00:12:27,414 --> 00:12:29,375
So, what happened
to your horse?

153
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,001
Get in!

154
00:12:31,126 --> 00:12:32,878
He was kinda old.

155
00:12:33,003 --> 00:12:35,673
I done had him for a bit.

156
00:12:35,798 --> 00:12:37,841
When the weather took a turn
for the worse,

157
00:12:37,967 --> 00:12:40,970
well, he done what he could,
but he couldn't make it.

158
00:12:41,095 --> 00:12:43,389
- Get in!
- That's too bad.

159
00:12:43,514 --> 00:12:45,724
Yeah, it is.

160
00:12:45,849 --> 00:12:48,894
Me and 0l' Lash done rode
a lot of miles together.

161
00:12:49,019 --> 00:12:50,938
Could say he was
my best friend,

162
00:12:51,063 --> 00:12:55,150
if I considered stupid animals
friends, which I don't.

163
00:12:55,276 --> 00:12:57,736
Nevertheless,
I'm gonna miss him.

164
00:12:59,363 --> 00:13:01,407
Leche! Ha!

165
00:13:01,532 --> 00:13:03,701
Who's this Daisy Domergue?

166
00:13:03,826 --> 00:13:06,495
A no damn good murdering bitch,
that's who.

167
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:08,205
Come on, boys! Get up!

168
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:09,790
I see you ain't got
mixed emotions

169
00:13:09,915 --> 00:13:11,417
about bringing a woman
to a rope.

170
00:13:11,542 --> 00:13:14,378
By "woman," you mean her?

171
00:13:14,503 --> 00:13:17,006
No, I do not have
mixed emotions.

172
00:13:17,131 --> 00:13:18,424
Get in! Ha!

173
00:13:18,549 --> 00:13:20,718
So you taking her
into Red Rock to hang.

174
00:13:20,843 --> 00:13:22,052
You bet.

175
00:13:22,177 --> 00:13:23,429
You gonna wait round
to watch it?

176
00:13:23,554 --> 00:13:25,014
Oh, you know I am.

177
00:13:25,139 --> 00:13:27,266
- Come on!
- I want to hear her neck snap

178
00:13:27,391 --> 00:13:28,726
with my own two ears.

179
00:13:28,851 --> 00:13:30,561
Get up, boys!

180
00:13:30,686 --> 00:13:33,105
- You never wait
to watch 'em hang? -Get up!

181
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:35,190
My bounties never hang,

182
00:13:35,316 --> 00:13:37,568
'cause I never
bring 'em in alive.

183
00:13:37,693 --> 00:13:39,987
- Never?
- Never ever.

184
00:13:40,112 --> 00:13:41,530
- Ha! Get up! Yah!
- We talked about this

185
00:13:41,655 --> 00:13:44,116
in Chattanooga. Bringing
desperate men in alive's

186
00:13:44,241 --> 00:13:45,701
a good way
to get yourself dead.

187
00:13:45,826 --> 00:13:47,703
- Get in there!
- Can't catch me sleeping

188
00:13:47,828 --> 00:13:49,121
if I don't close my eyes.

189
00:13:49,246 --> 00:13:50,622
I don't want to work that hard.

190
00:13:50,748 --> 00:13:52,583
No one said the job is
supposed to be easy.

191
00:13:52,708 --> 00:13:54,752
No one said it's supposed to be
that hard, neither.

192
00:13:54,877 --> 00:13:57,755
- Get up, boys! Ha!
- But that, little lady,

193
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,757
is why they call him
"The Hangman."

194
00:13:59,882 --> 00:14:02,426
When the handbill says
"dead or alive,"

195
00:14:02,551 --> 00:14:04,345
the rest of us
shoot ya in the back

196
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:06,055
from up on top
of a perch somewhere,

197
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:07,931
- bring ya in dead over
a saddle. - Get in!

198
00:14:08,057 --> 00:14:11,727
But when John Ruth The Hangman
catches ya,

199
00:14:11,852 --> 00:14:13,854
you don't die from no bullet
in the back.

200
00:14:13,979 --> 00:14:15,564
Mm-mm.

201
00:14:15,689 --> 00:14:18,442
When The Hangman catches you,
you hang.

202
00:14:18,567 --> 00:14:21,487
Ha!

203
00:14:21,612 --> 00:14:23,739
You overrate him, nigger.

204
00:14:23,864 --> 00:14:27,493
I give ya he got guts,
but in the brains department,

205
00:14:27,618 --> 00:14:31,413
he like a man who took
a high dive in a low well.

206
00:14:35,209 --> 00:14:37,086
Now, Daisy,

207
00:14:37,211 --> 00:14:40,923
I want us to work out a signal
system of communication.

208
00:14:41,048 --> 00:14:46,303
When I elbow you real hard in
the face, that means "shut up."

209
00:14:46,428 --> 00:14:47,846
You got it?

210
00:14:49,056 --> 00:14:50,766
I got it.

211
00:14:50,891 --> 00:14:54,686
Get in there!

212
00:14:57,606 --> 00:14:59,733

Get in!

231
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:21,273
Get in there!

232
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:29,031
Mm.

233
00:16:29,156 --> 00:16:30,866
Giddyup!

234
00:16:33,577 --> 00:16:37,372
I, uh... I know we only
met each other the once before,

235
00:16:37,498 --> 00:16:40,959
-and, uh, I don't mean to
unduly imply intimacy, -Get up!

236
00:16:41,084 --> 00:16:44,796
- But, well...
- Yah!

237
00:16:44,922 --> 00:16:46,924
You still got it?

238
00:16:47,049 --> 00:16:48,258
Do I still got what?

239
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:49,801
Get in, now!

240
00:16:49,927 --> 00:16:52,054
The Lincoln letter.

241
00:16:52,179 --> 00:16:53,805
Mm. Course.

242
00:16:53,931 --> 00:16:56,225
Get up, boys!

243
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:57,893
- Got it on ya?
- Mm-hmm.

244
00:16:58,018 --> 00:16:58,894
Come on!

245
00:16:59,019 --> 00:16:59,978
Where?

246
00:17:00,103 --> 00:17:01,813
Right here.

247
00:17:01,939 --> 00:17:03,565
Come on, boys! Get up!

248
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:05,901
Look, I know you got to be
real careful with it and all,

249
00:17:06,026 --> 00:17:08,737
and I can imagine you probably
don't like taking it

250
00:17:08,862 --> 00:17:10,697
in and out of the envelope
all that often,

251
00:17:10,822 --> 00:17:12,699
-but, uh...
- Get up!

252
00:17:12,824 --> 00:17:16,703
If you wouldn't mind, I'd sure
appreciate seeing that again.

253
00:17:16,828 --> 00:17:18,288
Get in, boys!

254
00:17:18,413 --> 00:17:21,542
Ha! Giddyup!

255
00:17:21,667 --> 00:17:22,918
You're right.

256
00:17:23,043 --> 00:17:25,170
IdonWHke
taking it in and out

257
00:17:25,295 --> 00:17:27,422
-of the envelope that much.
-|... Yeah.

258
00:17:27,548 --> 00:17:28,924
- But...
- Get in!

259
00:17:29,049 --> 00:17:31,927
Seeing's how you saved
my life and all...

260
00:17:32,052 --> 00:17:34,137
I suppose I could let you
read it again.

261
00:17:34,263 --> 00:17:36,306
Get in! Ha!

262
00:17:36,431 --> 00:17:38,934
Get in there!

263
00:17:41,144 --> 00:17:43,105
Get up now!

264
00:17:48,986 --> 00:17:50,445
Get in!

265
00:17:50,571 --> 00:17:51,947
GiddyUP!

266
00:17:52,072 --> 00:17:54,032
Huh!

267
00:17:58,203 --> 00:18:00,330
Get in, now!

268
00:18:04,585 --> 00:18:06,295
Get in!

269
00:18:17,139 --> 00:18:21,101
"Ole Mary Todd's calling, so I
guess it must be time for bed."

270
00:18:23,145 --> 00:18:25,022
Ole Mary Todd.

271
00:18:25,147 --> 00:18:27,608
Ha!

272
00:18:27,733 --> 00:18:29,985
Get in!

273
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:32,362
- Well, that...
- Get up, boys!

274
00:18:32,487 --> 00:18:33,363
That gets me.

275
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:36,700
Yeah, it gets me, too.

276
00:18:36,825 --> 00:18:38,660
Get in! Get in!

277
00:18:38,785 --> 00:18:41,830
You know what this is, tramp?
Hmm?

278
00:18:41,955 --> 00:18:44,207
It's a letter from Lincoln.

279
00:18:44,333 --> 00:18:46,793
- Letter from Lincoln to him.
- Get in there!

280
00:18:46,918 --> 00:18:48,211
Yeah.

281
00:18:48,337 --> 00:18:50,297
They shared a correspondence
during the war.

282
00:18:50,422 --> 00:18:51,798
They was pen pals.

283
00:18:51,923 --> 00:18:54,801
- And this is just one
of the letters. -Get up!

284
00:18:57,471 --> 00:18:59,222
What the...

285
00:18:59,348 --> 00:19:01,391
Hyah! - O.B.!

286
00:19:01,516 --> 00:19:02,809
Stop!

287
00:19:02,934 --> 00:19:03,894
Whoa!

288
00:19:04,019 --> 00:19:05,062
Easy.

289
00:19:05,187 --> 00:19:06,521
Whoa.

290
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,778
All the stupid...

291
00:19:12,903 --> 00:19:15,364
Like to rip my goddamn arm off!

292
00:19:48,855 --> 00:19:52,484
I didn't drag her stinking ass
up this goddamn mountain

293
00:19:52,609 --> 00:19:54,903
just for you to break her neck
on the outskirts of town!

294
00:19:55,028 --> 00:19:57,614
You the one handed her
my goddamn letter!

295
00:19:57,739 --> 00:19:59,241
I didn't give it to her,

296
00:19:59,366 --> 00:20:01,326
I give it to you!

297
00:20:03,578 --> 00:20:05,664
That nigger
like to bust my jaw.

298
00:20:08,709 --> 00:20:10,168
You ruin that letter of his,

299
00:20:10,293 --> 00:20:12,254
that nigger gonna
stomp your ass to death.

300
00:20:12,379 --> 00:20:15,590
And when he do, I'm gonna
sit back on that wagon wheel,

301
00:20:15,716 --> 00:20:16,883
watch and laugh!

302
00:20:18,009 --> 00:20:19,761
How is it?

303
00:20:19,886 --> 00:20:21,722
Well, she ain't help it none.

304
00:20:21,847 --> 00:20:23,682
But it's all right.

305
00:20:23,807 --> 00:20:27,519
Is that the way
niggers treat their ladies?

306
00:20:27,644 --> 00:20:30,105
You ain't no goddamn lady!

307
00:20:37,237 --> 00:20:38,697
Hey, Mr. Ruth!

308
00:20:38,822 --> 00:20:40,407
What?

309
00:20:40,532 --> 00:20:42,784
There's another fella on foot
up here on the road.

310
00:20:42,909 --> 00:20:45,162
Hey!

311
00:20:45,287 --> 00:20:47,122
What?!

312
00:20:47,247 --> 00:20:52,210
I said there's another fella
on foot, up here on the road.

313
00:21:09,311 --> 00:21:12,189
Hey! Hey!

314
00:21:12,314 --> 00:21:15,066
Considering there's
a blizzard going on,

315
00:21:15,192 --> 00:21:16,777
whole lot of fellas
walking around,

316
00:21:16,902 --> 00:21:18,403
wouldn't you say, Major?

317
00:21:18,528 --> 00:21:20,405
Well, seeing as how
I'm half of them fellas,

318
00:21:20,530 --> 00:21:22,741
uh,yeah,
seems to be a lot of us.

319
00:21:22,866 --> 00:21:26,703
This changes things, son.

320
00:21:26,828 --> 00:21:30,332
$8,000 a lot of money
for a nigger.

321
00:21:30,457 --> 00:21:32,584
With a partner,
18's a whole lot better.

322
00:21:32,709 --> 00:21:36,171
You really think I'm in cahoots
with that fella, or her?!

323
00:21:36,296 --> 00:21:37,589
Put them on.

324
00:21:37,714 --> 00:21:39,049
Oh, I-| ain't wearing
no handcuffs.

325
00:21:39,174 --> 00:21:41,092
You put those on,
or you can stop

326
00:21:41,218 --> 00:21:43,512
worrying about
this whole thing right now!

327
00:21:44,679 --> 00:21:46,264
Hey!

328
00:21:57,692 --> 00:22:00,570
Hey!

329
00:22:06,326 --> 00:22:08,787
Hand your weapons
to the driver.

330
00:22:08,912 --> 00:22:10,789
Little jumpy, ain't you?

331
00:22:10,914 --> 00:22:13,792
Never mind the jokes.
Just do it.

332
00:22:13,917 --> 00:22:15,377
If you say so.

333
00:22:15,502 --> 00:22:17,462
I do.

334
00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:41,236
Okay.

335
00:22:41,361 --> 00:22:42,737
I done done it.

336
00:22:42,863 --> 00:22:44,614
O.B., you got 'em?

337
00:22:44,739 --> 00:22:45,740
I got 'em.

338
00:22:45,866 --> 00:22:47,617
Okay, fella.

339
00:22:47,742 --> 00:22:50,120
You keep holding that lantern
in that one hand,

340
00:22:50,245 --> 00:22:53,373
and you keep that other hand
where I can see it.

341
00:22:53,498 --> 00:22:56,209
Walk over there where I can
get a good look at ya.

342
00:23:08,388 --> 00:23:12,183
Well, I'll be
a goddamn dog in a manger.

343
00:23:12,309 --> 00:23:15,061
Is that you, Chris Mannix?

344
00:23:15,186 --> 00:23:17,063
I'm sorry, friend,
do we know each other?

345
00:23:17,188 --> 00:23:18,189
Not quite.

346
00:23:18,315 --> 00:23:19,608
You know this fella?

347
00:23:19,733 --> 00:23:21,860
Only by reputation.

348
00:23:21,985 --> 00:23:25,989
Like I said, friend, you got me
at a bit of a disadvantage.

349
00:23:26,114 --> 00:23:27,532
Keeping you at a disadvantage

350
00:23:27,657 --> 00:23:29,784
is an advantage
I intend to keep.

351
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:32,913
Uh, whoever you are, mister,
you sure sound tough

352
00:23:33,038 --> 00:23:36,124
when you talking to a desperate
man knee-deep in snow.

353
00:23:36,249 --> 00:23:38,710
L-I... I don't want no trouble.

354
00:23:38,835 --> 00:23:39,920
I just want a ride.

355
00:23:40,045 --> 00:23:42,297
L-I'm freezing to death!

356
00:23:42,422 --> 00:23:43,924
Who is this joker?

357
00:23:44,049 --> 00:23:48,637
You heard of the rebel renegade
Erskine Mannix?

358
00:23:48,762 --> 00:23:50,722
- Mannix's Marauders?
- That's them.

359
00:23:50,847 --> 00:23:53,892
Scourge of South Carolina,
Mannix's Marauders.

360
00:23:54,017 --> 00:23:56,311
It's Erskine's youngest boy,
Chris.

361
00:23:56,436 --> 00:23:58,688
Brings you in my path,
Chris Mannix?

362
00:23:58,813 --> 00:24:02,192
Well, Mr. Face,
I was riding to Red Rock,

363
00:24:02,317 --> 00:24:04,694
my horse stepped in
a gopher hole in the snow,

364
00:24:04,819 --> 00:24:07,113
fucked up his leg,
had to put 'er down.

365
00:24:07,238 --> 00:24:08,698
You got business in Red Rock?

366
00:24:08,823 --> 00:24:10,325
- Yes, I do.
- What?

367
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:12,035
I'm the new sheriff.

368
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:13,662
Horseshit.

369
00:24:13,787 --> 00:24:15,664
-'Fraid not.
- Where's your star?

370
00:24:15,789 --> 00:24:17,415
Well, I ain't the sheriff yet.

371
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:19,334
Now, once I get there,
they swear me in.

372
00:24:19,459 --> 00:24:21,086
But, uh, that ain't
happened yet.

373
00:24:21,211 --> 00:24:22,712
And-and that's when
you get your star.

374
00:24:22,837 --> 00:24:25,006
You got anything that can
back any of this up?

375
00:24:25,131 --> 00:24:27,342
Yeah. When we get to Red Rock.

376
00:24:27,467 --> 00:24:30,428
And-and from the look of those
three frozen fuckers up there,

377
00:24:30,553 --> 00:24:33,098
I-| figure you a bounty hunter
open for business.

378
00:24:33,223 --> 00:24:35,100
And-and I figure you taking
them three dead bodies

379
00:24:35,225 --> 00:24:37,227
into Red Rock to get paid?

380
00:24:37,352 --> 00:24:38,520
Three dead.

381
00:24:38,645 --> 00:24:39,521
One alive.

382
00:24:40,689 --> 00:24:41,564
Who's that?

383
00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:43,358
Daisy Domergue.

384
00:24:43,483 --> 00:24:45,527
Who the fuck is Daisy Domergue?

385
00:24:45,652 --> 00:24:49,155
Not a goddamn thing to nobody,
except me and the hangman.

386
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:50,573
The hangman?

387
00:24:53,118 --> 00:24:56,413
Well, I'll be
double-dog damned.

388
00:24:56,538 --> 00:24:58,039
You're "The Hangman" Bob Ruth!

389
00:24:58,164 --> 00:24:59,290
It's John.

390
00:24:59,416 --> 00:25:01,626
And you!

391
00:25:01,751 --> 00:25:03,420
You're the nigger
with the head!

392
00:25:03,545 --> 00:25:05,547
Major Marquis!

393
00:25:05,672 --> 00:25:07,799
My Lord, is that really
the real head

394
00:25:07,924 --> 00:25:10,176
of Major Marquis
looking at me now?

395
00:25:10,301 --> 00:25:12,762
Yeah, it's really me,
and it's really my head.

396
00:25:12,887 --> 00:25:14,556
So what's going on?

397
00:25:14,681 --> 00:25:16,391
Uh, y'all having
a bounty hunters' picnic?

398
00:25:16,516 --> 00:25:17,976
Never mind.

399
00:25:18,101 --> 00:25:19,811
Uh, you taking
them three dead bodies

400
00:25:19,936 --> 00:25:21,813
and-and hurrying to Red Rock
to get paid, ain't you?

401
00:25:21,938 --> 00:25:23,148
Yeah.

402
00:25:23,273 --> 00:25:24,649
Well, the man in Red Rock's

403
00:25:24,774 --> 00:25:28,403
supposed to pay you is me,
the new sheriff.

404
00:25:28,528 --> 00:25:30,280
So if y'all want to get paid,

405
00:25:30,405 --> 00:25:32,407
y'all need to get me
to Red Rock.

406
00:25:32,532 --> 00:25:34,409
Well, excuse me
for finding it hard to believe

407
00:25:34,534 --> 00:25:38,079
a town electing you to do
anything except drop dead.

408
00:25:38,204 --> 00:25:39,789
So I'm supposed
to freeze to death

409
00:25:39,914 --> 00:25:42,125
'cause you find something
hard to believe?

410
00:25:45,879 --> 00:25:47,797
No, I suppose not.

411
00:25:52,635 --> 00:25:54,596
Put them on and come inside.

412
00:26:01,603 --> 00:26:03,438
No.

413
00:26:07,067 --> 00:26:08,526
Then you'll freeze.

414
00:26:08,651 --> 00:26:10,278
Then you'll hang.

415
00:26:10,403 --> 00:26:12,447
How so?

416
00:26:12,572 --> 00:26:16,659
Stagecoach driver, could you
come down here and join us?

417
00:26:16,785 --> 00:26:18,244
I got to hold these horses.

418
00:26:18,369 --> 00:26:20,497
I can hear you just fine
from up here.

419
00:26:20,622 --> 00:26:22,499
Well, you just heard me
tell this fella

420
00:26:22,624 --> 00:26:25,835
I'm the new sheriff
of Red Rock, right?

421
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:26,878
Yeah.

422
00:26:27,003 --> 00:26:29,464
Red Rock is my town now.

423
00:26:29,589 --> 00:26:32,008
And I'm gonna enter my town
in bounty hunter's chains?

424
00:26:32,133 --> 00:26:33,468
No, sir!

425
00:26:33,593 --> 00:26:34,969
Sorry, bushwhackers,

426
00:26:35,095 --> 00:26:37,222
I ain't entering Red Rock
that way.

427
00:26:37,347 --> 00:26:39,099
Now, when you finally get
to Red Rock,

428
00:26:39,224 --> 00:26:42,102
you gonna realize every
goddamn thing I said was right.

429
00:26:42,227 --> 00:26:44,521
And I expect you, O.B.,

430
00:26:44,646 --> 00:26:47,023
to tell the townsfolk
of Red Rock

431
00:26:47,148 --> 00:26:49,984
that John Ruth let their
new sheriff freeze to death.

432
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:51,986
Ain't no bounty on my head,
bushwhacker.

433
00:26:52,112 --> 00:26:55,198
You let me die, that's murder.

434
00:27:03,331 --> 00:27:05,291
Hold out your hands.

435
00:27:07,001 --> 00:27:08,878
O.B.!

436
00:27:09,003 --> 00:27:10,964
Give the major back his iron.

437
00:27:12,674 --> 00:27:14,425
One thing I know for sure,

438
00:27:14,551 --> 00:27:16,261
this nigger-hating
son of a gun

439
00:27:16,386 --> 00:27:18,513
ain't partnered up with you.

440
00:27:18,638 --> 00:27:21,724
Now, I'll help you protect
your 8,000,

441
00:27:21,850 --> 00:27:23,893
you help me protect my ten.

442
00:27:24,018 --> 00:27:25,687
Deal?

443
00:27:27,230 --> 00:27:29,107
Well, ain't love grand?

444
00:27:29,232 --> 00:27:31,734
Y'all want to lie on the ground
and make snow angels together?

445
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:33,611
Uaughs)

446
00:27:33,736 --> 00:27:34,821
Hut!

447
00:27:34,946 --> 00:27:37,115
Come on!

448
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:39,200
<i>H'! ax“!</i>

449
00:27:42,996 --> 00:27:44,539
Well, I'll tell you what, Bob.

450
00:27:44,664 --> 00:27:45,915
The name's John.

451
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:47,542
- When we get to Red Rock,
- O.B.: Hyah!

452
00:27:47,667 --> 00:27:49,252
I'll buy you
and Major Marquis there

453
00:27:49,377 --> 00:27:50,712
- dinner and booze.
- Get in!

454
00:27:50,837 --> 00:27:52,130
My way of saying thanks.

455
00:27:52,255 --> 00:27:54,591
I don't drink
with rebel renegades,

456
00:27:54,716 --> 00:27:57,177
and I damn sure
don't break bread with them.

457
00:27:57,302 --> 00:27:59,345
- Well, Mr. Ruth...
- Get up, boys!

458
00:27:59,470 --> 00:28:00,805
You sound like you got

459
00:28:00,930 --> 00:28:02,557
a axe to grind
against the Cause.

460
00:28:02,682 --> 00:28:05,602
- "The Cause" of a
renegade army? - Get in!

461
00:28:05,727 --> 00:28:07,770
Bunch of losers gone loco.

462
00:28:07,896 --> 00:28:09,606
- You bet I do.
- Get up there! Hyah!

463
00:28:09,731 --> 00:28:11,232
You wrapped yourselves up
in a rebel flag

464
00:28:11,357 --> 00:28:12,901
as an excuse to kill and steal.

465
00:28:13,026 --> 00:28:15,403
And this ought
to interest you, Warren.

466
00:28:15,528 --> 00:28:17,906
Imparticular,
emancipated blacks.

467
00:28:18,031 --> 00:28:19,616
Sounds like my kind of fella.

468
00:28:22,118 --> 00:28:23,703
Sound to me you been reading

469
00:28:23,828 --> 00:28:27,624
a lot of newspapers printed
in Washington, D.C.

470
00:28:27,749 --> 00:28:30,710
- Get in! Huh!
- Anywho, I'm just trying

471
00:28:30,835 --> 00:28:32,921
to let y'all know
how grateful I am.

472
00:28:33,046 --> 00:28:34,589
I was a goner.

473
00:28:34,714 --> 00:28:36,090
And y'all saved me.

474
00:28:36,216 --> 00:28:38,509
You want to show me
how grateful you are?

475
00:28:38,635 --> 00:28:40,386
- Get in there!
- Shut up.

476
00:28:42,013 --> 00:28:43,139
Goddamn it, Daisy.

477
00:28:43,264 --> 00:28:46,184
It's coming.

478
00:28:46,309 --> 00:28:47,644
Get in there, Cimarron!

479
00:28:47,769 --> 00:28:48,937
Here.

480
00:28:49,062 --> 00:28:49,979
Last piece.

481
00:28:50,104 --> 00:28:52,857
Get in!

482
00:28:52,982 --> 00:28:55,276
Get in, now!

483
00:28:55,401 --> 00:28:57,487
<i>H'! ax“!</i>

484

485
00:29:01,324 --> 00:29:04,244
Does he know
how famous you once was?

486
00:29:04,369 --> 00:29:05,620
I don't think so.

487
00:29:05,745 --> 00:29:07,288
Giddyup!

488
00:29:07,413 --> 00:29:09,040
Black Eye.

489
00:29:10,667 --> 00:29:12,168
- Do you know who he is?
- Get in!

490
00:29:12,293 --> 00:29:14,754
Do I know
about the $30,000 reward

491
00:29:14,879 --> 00:29:17,215
the Confederacy put on the head
of Major Marquis?

492
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:18,925
Come on now, boys!

493
00:29:19,050 --> 00:29:20,468
- Get in!
- Yeah.

494
00:29:20,593 --> 00:29:22,428
Ah, them hillbillies
went nigger head-hunting.

495
00:29:22,553 --> 00:29:24,180
- Get in!
- They just never did get 'em

496
00:29:24,305 --> 00:29:25,431
the right nigger head,
did they?

497
00:29:25,556 --> 00:29:27,475
No, they didn't.

498
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,018
But it wasn't
for lack of trying.

499
00:29:29,143 --> 00:29:30,687
Get in, boys! Ha! Get on!

500
00:29:30,812 --> 00:29:32,563
Them peckerwoods
left their homes and families,

501
00:29:32,689 --> 00:29:35,525
and come up this snowy mountain
looking for me and fortune.

502
00:29:35,650 --> 00:29:37,443
Ha! Get up!

503
00:29:37,568 --> 00:29:39,153
Ain't none of 'em
found fortune.

504
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:42,198
The ones you ain't
never heard of no more,

505
00:29:42,323 --> 00:29:44,075
they found me.

506
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:46,411
Now, it didn't stay $30,000
the length of the war.

507
00:29:46,536 --> 00:29:47,870
Once passions cooled,

508
00:29:47,996 --> 00:29:49,372
it dropped down to eight,
then five.

509
00:29:49,497 --> 00:29:50,665
Get up, boys! Ha!

510
00:29:50,790 --> 00:29:52,917
But I bet even
when it was 5,000,

511
00:29:53,042 --> 00:29:55,670
you had your share
of country boys coming to call.

512
00:29:55,795 --> 00:29:58,923
Mm, you know I did.

513
00:29:59,048 --> 00:30:01,676
Why'd they have
a reward on you?

514
00:30:01,801 --> 00:30:04,220
Confederates took exception
to my capacity for killing 'em.

515
00:30:04,345 --> 00:30:05,722
Get up, now!

516
00:30:05,847 --> 00:30:07,932
And after I broke
out of Wellenbeck,

517
00:30:08,057 --> 00:30:10,810
well, the South took
my continued existence

518
00:30:10,935 --> 00:30:12,687
- as a personal affront.
- Get up!

519
00:30:12,812 --> 00:30:15,690
- And the Cause put a reward
on my head. - Hmm.

520
00:30:15,815 --> 00:30:16,858
Get in there!

521
00:30:16,983 --> 00:30:19,485
What's, uh, Wellenbeck?

522
00:30:19,610 --> 00:30:21,112
You ain't never heard

523
00:30:21,237 --> 00:30:22,613
of Wellenbeck prisoner
of war camp, West Virginia?

524
00:30:22,739 --> 00:30:24,574
No, reb,
I ain't never heard of it.

525
00:30:24,699 --> 00:30:26,534
- Hyah!
- Did you bust out?

526
00:30:26,659 --> 00:30:28,077
Oh,

527
00:30:28,202 --> 00:30:31,456
Major Marquis did more
than bust out.

528
00:30:31,581 --> 00:30:33,291
Major Marquis
had a bright idea.

529
00:30:33,416 --> 00:30:34,500
Get in, now!

530
00:30:34,625 --> 00:30:36,919
So bright, you got to wonder

531
00:30:37,045 --> 00:30:39,380
why nobody never thought
about it before.

532
00:30:40,882 --> 00:30:42,925
Tell John Ruth
your bright idea.

533
00:30:44,761 --> 00:30:47,096
Well, the whole damn place

534
00:30:47,221 --> 00:30:48,598
was just made out of kindling.

535
00:30:48,723 --> 00:30:50,016
Get in!

536
00:30:50,141 --> 00:30:51,601
So I burnt it down.

537
00:30:54,145 --> 00:30:56,230
Get in! Hyah!

538
00:30:58,107 --> 00:31:01,652
There was a rookie regiment
spending overnight in the camp.

539
00:31:01,778 --> 00:31:04,822
47 men burnt to a crisp.

540
00:31:04,947 --> 00:31:07,992
- Southern youth, farmers' sons,
- O.B.: Get up!

541
00:31:08,117 --> 00:31:09,243
Cream of the crop.

542
00:31:09,369 --> 00:31:10,953
And I say, "Let 'em burn."

543
00:31:11,079 --> 00:31:14,540
I'm supposed to apologize
for killing Johnny Reb?

544
00:31:14,665 --> 00:31:17,377
You joined the war
to keep niggers in chains.

545
00:31:17,502 --> 00:31:19,379
I joined the war to kill

546
00:31:19,504 --> 00:31:21,089
- white Southern crackers.
- Ha! Get up!

547
00:31:21,214 --> 00:31:23,257
And that means killing 'em
any way I can.

548
00:31:23,383 --> 00:31:25,510
- Get in!
- Shoot 'em, stab 'em,

549
00:31:25,635 --> 00:31:27,470
drown 'em, burn 'em,

550
00:31:27,595 --> 00:31:29,931
drop a big 0l' rock
on their head.

551
00:31:30,056 --> 00:31:31,641
Whatever it took to put
white Southern crackers

552
00:31:31,766 --> 00:31:33,518
-in the ground,
- O.B.: Get up!

553
00:31:33,643 --> 00:31:35,395
That's what I joined
the war to do.

554
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:36,771
And that's what I did.

555
00:31:36,896 --> 00:31:38,940
To answer your question,
John Ruth,

556
00:31:39,065 --> 00:31:42,944
when Major Marquis
burned 47 men alive,

557
00:31:43,069 --> 00:31:45,863
for no more reason than to give
a nigger a run for the trees,

558
00:31:45,988 --> 00:31:47,782
that's when the South
put a reward

559
00:31:47,907 --> 00:31:49,200
on the head of Major Marquis.

560
00:31:49,325 --> 00:31:51,077
- And I made them trees, Mannix.
- Get in!

561
00:31:51,202 --> 00:31:52,912
You best believe
I ain't looked back

562
00:31:53,037 --> 00:31:54,789
till I crossed
the Northern line.

563
00:31:54,914 --> 00:31:56,624
Oh, but you had
a surprise waiting for you

564
00:31:56,749 --> 00:31:58,835
on the Northern side,
didn't you?

565
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,711
See, once they started
pulling out

566
00:32:00,837 --> 00:32:03,339
all them burnt bodies
at Wellenbeck,

567
00:32:03,464 --> 00:32:05,800
seems not all them boys
were rebs.

568
00:32:05,925 --> 00:32:08,845
Why, you burn up
some of your own boys,

569
00:32:08,970 --> 00:32:10,304
didn't you, Major?

570
00:32:10,430 --> 00:32:12,807
How many burnt prisoners
they end up finding?

571
00:32:12,932 --> 00:32:14,725
Wasn't the final
Yankee death count

572
00:32:14,851 --> 00:32:17,311
something like 37?

573
00:32:17,437 --> 00:32:18,813
Giddyup!

574
00:32:18,938 --> 00:32:20,606
That's the thing about war,
Mannix.

575
00:32:20,731 --> 00:32:22,150
People die.

576
00:32:22,275 --> 00:32:23,609
Oh.

577
00:32:23,734 --> 00:32:26,821
So you gonna chalk it up
to "war is hell," huh?

578
00:32:26,946 --> 00:32:29,365
Well, admittedly, that is
a hard argument to argue with.

579
00:32:29,490 --> 00:32:31,367
But if memory serves,

580
00:32:31,492 --> 00:32:34,829
your side didn't look
at it that way.

581
00:32:34,954 --> 00:32:37,373
I think they thought
37 white men

582
00:32:37,498 --> 00:32:39,834
for one nigger

583
00:32:39,959 --> 00:32:42,128
wasn't so hot a trade.

584
00:32:42,253 --> 00:32:45,506
- I do believe they accused you
- O.B.: Giddyup!

585
00:32:45,631 --> 00:32:46,924
Of being a kill-crazy nigger

586
00:32:47,049 --> 00:32:49,135
who only joined the war
to kill white folks,

587
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:50,887
and the whole
blue and gray of it all

588
00:32:51,012 --> 00:32:52,054
really didn't matter
that much to you.

589
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:53,598
Ha! Get up!

590
00:32:53,723 --> 00:32:55,725
And that's why they drummed
your black ass

591
00:32:55,850 --> 00:32:58,227
out of the cavalry with
a yellow stripe down your back.

592
00:32:58,352 --> 00:33:01,522
- Get in!
- Isn't it, Major?

593
00:33:01,647 --> 00:33:02,982
Horseshit!

594
00:33:03,107 --> 00:33:04,567
If he'd have did all that,
the cavalry

595
00:33:04,692 --> 00:33:06,068
- would've shot him.
- Get in!

596
00:33:06,194 --> 00:33:07,695
Well, I didn't say
they could prove it.

597
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:09,155
- Get up!
- But they sure did

598
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:11,199
think it out loud,
didn't they, Major?

599
00:33:11,324 --> 00:33:13,159
Hyah! Get up, boys!

600
00:33:13,284 --> 00:33:15,912
But Warren's war record
was stellar,

601
00:33:16,037 --> 00:33:18,414
and that's what saved his ass.

602
00:33:18,539 --> 00:33:19,665
Hyah!

603
00:33:19,790 --> 00:33:21,584
Now, you killed yourself
your share

604
00:33:21,709 --> 00:33:26,005
of redskins in your day,
didn't you, Black Major?

605
00:33:26,130 --> 00:33:28,132
Cavalry tends
to look kindly on that.

606
00:33:28,257 --> 00:33:31,135
I'll tell you what the cavalry
didn't look kindly on.

607
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:32,803
- Giddyup!
- Mannix's Marauders,

608
00:33:32,929 --> 00:33:34,555
- that's what.
- Get in! Hyah!

609
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:36,766
And the fact that
Erskine Mannix's little boy

610
00:33:36,891 --> 00:33:38,768
would talk
about anybody else's behavior

611
00:33:38,893 --> 00:33:42,271
during war time
makes me want to horse-laugh.

612
00:33:42,396 --> 00:33:43,648
Hyah!

613
00:33:43,773 --> 00:33:46,901
Don't you say anything
about my daddy.

614
00:33:47,026 --> 00:33:50,404
- What he fought for was dignity
in defeat, -O.B.: Get up there!

615
00:33:50,530 --> 00:33:52,823
And against
the unconditional surrender.

616
00:33:52,949 --> 00:33:56,410
We weren't foreign barbarians
pounding on the city walls.

617
00:33:56,536 --> 00:33:58,538
- Ha!
- We were your brothers.

618
00:33:58,663 --> 00:33:59,997
Get up, now!

619
00:34:00,122 --> 00:34:01,916
We deserved dignity in defeat.

620
00:34:02,041 --> 00:34:04,794
Just how many
nigger towns did y'all sack

621
00:34:04,919 --> 00:34:07,338
in your fight
for dignity in defeat?

622
00:34:07,463 --> 00:34:09,757
Oh, my fair share, Black Major.

623
00:34:09,882 --> 00:34:12,468
-'Cause when niggers
are scared, -O.B.: Huh!

624
00:34:12,593 --> 00:34:14,470
That's when white folks
are safe.

625
00:34:16,222 --> 00:34:19,100
You gonna talk
that hateful nigger talk,

626
00:34:19,225 --> 00:34:22,436
you can ride up top with O.B.

627
00:34:22,562 --> 00:34:23,771
No.

628
00:34:23,896 --> 00:34:25,439
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

629
00:34:25,565 --> 00:34:28,025
You done got me
talking politics.

630
00:34:28,150 --> 00:34:30,278
I didn't want to.

631
00:34:30,403 --> 00:34:33,447
Like I said, y'all,
I'm just happy to be alive.

632
00:34:33,573 --> 00:34:35,616
Get in, now!

633
00:34:35,741 --> 00:34:37,618
Ha! Get up!

634
00:34:37,743 --> 00:34:40,830
I think I'll scoot over here
right by this window,

635
00:34:40,955 --> 00:34:45,459
and let this beautiful carriage
rock me to sleep.

636
00:34:45,585 --> 00:34:48,379
And dream about how lucky I am.

637
00:34:52,091 --> 00:34:54,051
Get up, now!

638
00:34:56,846 --> 00:34:59,515
Ha!

639
00:35:44,268 --> 00:35:46,020
Hyah! Get in!

640
00:35:46,145 --> 00:35:47,438
Get in there!

641
00:35:47,563 --> 00:35:48,814
Get in, hyah!

642
00:35:48,939 --> 00:35:50,107
Get in there!

643
00:35:50,232 --> 00:35:52,026
Get in!

644
00:35:52,151 --> 00:35:53,903
Get in there, Leche!

645
00:35:54,028 --> 00:35:55,821
Get in there!

646
00:35:55,946 --> 00:35:59,033
Whoa, whoa, easy.

647
00:35:59,158 --> 00:36:02,161
Whoa. Whoa.

648
00:36:23,808 --> 00:36:25,393
What the hell is going on?

649
00:36:25,518 --> 00:36:28,437
We weren't expecting
another stage tonight!

650
00:36:28,562 --> 00:36:32,608
Yeah, I can see you already
got another one up in here.

651
00:36:32,733 --> 00:36:35,361
Just got through
putting the horses away.

652
00:36:35,486 --> 00:36:37,196
Well, this ain't
the normal line,

653
00:36:37,321 --> 00:36:40,199
but we are stuck on
the wrong side of a blizzard,

654
00:36:40,324 --> 00:36:42,576
so it looks like
you're stuck with us.

655
00:36:42,702 --> 00:36:44,662
Are Minnie
and Sweet Dave inside?

656
00:36:44,787 --> 00:36:46,288
They ain't here.

657
00:36:46,414 --> 00:36:48,666
I'm running the place
while they're gone.

658
00:36:50,418 --> 00:36:52,378
Where's Minnie and Sweet Dave?

659
00:36:52,503 --> 00:36:54,338
He says they ain't here.

660
00:36:54,463 --> 00:36:56,674
He's looking after the place
while they're gone.

661
00:36:56,799 --> 00:36:59,176
Who are you?

662
00:37:01,262 --> 00:37:02,471
I'm Bob.

663
00:37:04,807 --> 00:37:08,978
Well, whoever you are,
help O.B. with the horses.

664
00:37:09,103 --> 00:37:11,105
Come on.

665
00:37:11,230 --> 00:37:14,233
Get 'em out of this cold
'fore that blizzard hits us.

666
00:37:14,358 --> 00:37:16,861
Whoa. You all right?

667
00:37:16,986 --> 00:37:18,112
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

668
00:37:18,237 --> 00:37:19,280
Esperate, esperate, esperate!

669
00:37:19,405 --> 00:37:21,782
I just put
those other horses away.

670
00:37:21,907 --> 00:37:24,952
You need it done fast,
you need to help.

671
00:37:25,077 --> 00:37:27,580
I got two of my best men on it.

672
00:37:28,831 --> 00:37:31,125
You heard him, freeloaders.

673
00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:33,377
Get to work!

674
00:37:33,502 --> 00:37:36,005
All right, you two,
unhook the leaders.

675
00:37:36,130 --> 00:37:37,381
Come on, let's go.

676
00:37:37,506 --> 00:37:39,133
Open up!

677
00:37:39,258 --> 00:37:40,760
- You have to kick it open!
- Ya got to kick it open!

678
00:37:40,885 --> 00:37:41,761
What?

679
00:37:41,886 --> 00:37:43,345
Kick it open!

680
00:37:43,471 --> 00:37:45,264
Shut that door.

681
00:37:45,389 --> 00:37:46,557
There's a goddamn blizzard
out there!

682
00:37:46,682 --> 00:37:48,058
You have to stop,
close the door!

683
00:37:48,184 --> 00:37:49,435
You got to nail it shut.

684
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:52,313
You have to,
you have to nail it shut!

685
00:37:52,438 --> 00:37:53,814
Hold it shut!

686
00:37:53,939 --> 00:37:55,649
There's a hammer
and nails by the door!

687
00:37:55,775 --> 00:37:57,151
You have to nail it shut!

688
00:37:57,276 --> 00:38:00,362
There's a hammer and nails
by the door.

689
00:38:00,488 --> 00:38:02,364
- Give me a hammer.
- Yeah.

690
00:38:11,290 --> 00:38:12,875
You need,
you need two pieces of wood!

691
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,710
You need two pieces of wood!
One ain't good enough!

692
00:38:14,835 --> 00:38:16,086
Two pieces of wood!

693
00:38:16,212 --> 00:38:18,547
The fuckin' thing is busted!

694
00:38:18,672 --> 00:38:21,383
Not just one piece of wood!

695
00:38:21,509 --> 00:38:22,843
Give me another piece of wood.

696
00:38:22,968 --> 00:38:24,929
Yeah. All right.

697
00:38:29,391 --> 00:38:31,018
- I need a nail.
- Here.

698
00:38:43,989 --> 00:38:45,574
Jesus.

699
00:38:48,494 --> 00:38:50,704
That door's a son of a gun.

700
00:38:50,830 --> 00:38:52,623
Who's the idiot who broke that,

701
00:38:52,748 --> 00:38:54,708
that Mexican fella?

702
00:38:54,834 --> 00:38:56,210
Oh, good heavens.

703
00:38:56,335 --> 00:38:57,628
A woman?

704
00:38:57,753 --> 00:38:59,088
Out in this white hell?

705
00:38:59,213 --> 00:39:02,383
You must be frozen solid,
poor thing.

706
00:39:04,093 --> 00:39:06,804
Looks like Minnie's
got her a full house.

707
00:39:09,139 --> 00:39:11,225
When did you fellas arrive?

708
00:39:11,350 --> 00:39:12,393
Ah.

709
00:39:12,518 --> 00:39:14,436
About 40 minutes ago.

710
00:39:14,562 --> 00:39:16,313
That cowboy fella
in the corner,

711
00:39:16,438 --> 00:39:18,357
-that your driver?
- No, no, he's a passenger.

712
00:39:18,482 --> 00:39:20,401
The driver lit out.

713
00:39:20,526 --> 00:39:22,319
Said he was going to spend
the blizzard

714
00:39:22,444 --> 00:39:23,529
shacked up with a friend.

715
00:39:23,654 --> 00:39:26,240
Lucky devil.

716
00:39:26,365 --> 00:39:28,492
Jesus Christ, that's awful!

717
00:39:28,617 --> 00:39:31,120
Christ Almighty,

718
00:39:31,245 --> 00:39:34,248
what'd that Mexican fella do,
soak his old socks in a pot?

719
00:39:34,373 --> 00:39:36,959
Yes, uh... l-| think
we all felt the same way,

720
00:39:37,084 --> 00:39:40,170
but were a little too polite
to say something.

721
00:39:40,296 --> 00:39:42,548
- He don't have that problem.
- Shit.

722
00:39:42,673 --> 00:39:44,341
Where's the well water?

723
00:39:44,466 --> 00:39:46,010
Uh, over there.

724
00:39:51,891 --> 00:39:55,394
So, all three of you fellas
headed to Red Rock

725
00:39:55,519 --> 00:39:58,272
when the blizzard
stopped you, huh?

726
00:39:58,397 --> 00:40:01,567
Yes. All three of us were
on that stagecoach out there.

727
00:40:12,912 --> 00:40:15,497
Coffee beans.

728
00:40:15,623 --> 00:40:18,167
Uh, over there.

729
00:40:26,258 --> 00:40:28,427
Get your hand out of there.

730
00:40:32,431 --> 00:40:35,142
New sheriff of Red Rock's
travelin' with us.

731
00:40:35,267 --> 00:40:38,145
Ah, sheriff of Red Rock,
that'll be the day.

732
00:40:38,270 --> 00:40:41,106
He's a goddamn sheriff,
I'm a monkey's uncle.

733
00:40:41,231 --> 00:40:42,316
Good.

734
00:40:42,441 --> 00:40:43,651
Then you can share bananas

735
00:40:43,776 --> 00:40:45,319
with your nigger friend
in the stable.

736
00:40:45,444 --> 00:40:47,696
So,

737
00:40:47,821 --> 00:40:50,032
the new sheriff of Red Rock
is traveling with you?

738
00:40:50,157 --> 00:40:51,492
Oh, he's lying.

739
00:40:51,617 --> 00:40:53,535
He ain't sheriff of nothin'.

740
00:40:53,661 --> 00:40:55,579
He's a Southern renegade.

741
00:40:55,704 --> 00:40:57,373
He's just talking hisself

742
00:40:57,498 --> 00:40:59,249
out of freezing to death
is all.

743
00:40:59,375 --> 00:41:01,335
What the fuck I tell you
about talking, huh?

744
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:02,962
I'll bust you in the mouth

745
00:41:03,087 --> 00:41:05,339
right in front of these people.
I don't give a fuck!

746
00:41:05,464 --> 00:41:07,007
You never gave your name, sir.

747
00:41:07,132 --> 00:41:09,259
John Ruth.

748
00:41:09,385 --> 00:41:10,469
Are you a lawman?

749
00:41:10,594 --> 00:41:11,971
I'm taking her to the law.

750
00:41:12,096 --> 00:41:13,430
So you're a bounty hunter?

751
00:41:13,555 --> 00:41:15,808
That's right, buster.

752
00:41:17,893 --> 00:41:19,603
Do you have a warrant?

753
00:41:19,728 --> 00:41:21,021
Yeah, course I do.

754
00:41:21,146 --> 00:41:22,439
May I see it?

755
00:41:25,818 --> 00:41:27,361
Why?

756
00:41:27,486 --> 00:41:30,572
Ah. You're supposed
to produce it upon request.

757
00:41:30,698 --> 00:41:33,409
How am I supposed to know
you're not a villain,

758
00:41:33,534 --> 00:41:35,911
kidnapping this woman,

759
00:41:36,036 --> 00:41:37,997
without a warrant
in your possession?

760
00:41:40,082 --> 00:41:41,750
What's your name, buster?

761
00:41:41,875 --> 00:41:45,796
Well, it certainly
isn't Buster.

762
00:41:47,089 --> 00:41:50,384
It's Oswaldo Mobray.

763
00:41:51,552 --> 00:41:52,928
Oswaldo?

764
00:41:53,053 --> 00:41:54,471
Yes.

765
00:41:55,681 --> 00:41:57,599
Well,

766
00:41:57,725 --> 00:42:01,020
I got my warrant, Oswaldo.

767
00:42:14,450 --> 00:42:15,576
I take it
you're Daisy Domergue?

768
00:42:15,701 --> 00:42:17,286
- That's her.
- Yeah.

769
00:42:18,912 --> 00:42:20,539
I see.

770
00:42:22,166 --> 00:42:25,586
Uh, it says here
"dead or alive."

771
00:42:25,711 --> 00:42:27,546
Yeah. It does.

772
00:42:27,671 --> 00:42:29,715
Well, transporting a desperate,

773
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:32,259
hostile prisoner such as her

774
00:42:32,384 --> 00:42:34,219
sounds like hard work.

775
00:42:34,344 --> 00:42:37,264
Wouldn't transporting her
be easier

776
00:42:37,389 --> 00:42:38,849
if she were dead?

777
00:42:38,974 --> 00:42:41,643
Well, no one said the job
was supposed to be easy.

778
00:42:41,769 --> 00:42:44,271
And why is her hanging proper
so important to you?

779
00:42:44,396 --> 00:42:46,190
Let's just say I don't like
cheatin' the hangman.

780
00:42:46,315 --> 00:42:47,983
He got to make a living, too.

781
00:42:48,108 --> 00:42:50,486
Well, I appreciate that.

782
00:42:50,611 --> 00:42:53,489
Allow me to properly

783
00:42:53,614 --> 00:42:55,491
introduce myself.

784
00:42:55,616 --> 00:42:57,534
I'm Oswaldo Mobray,

785
00:42:57,659 --> 00:43:00,037
the hangman in these parts.

786
00:43:05,167 --> 00:43:07,044
- La-di-da.
- Ah.

787
00:43:07,169 --> 00:43:08,629
Looks like I brought you
a customer.

788
00:43:08,754 --> 00:43:09,880
Yeah, so it would appear.

789
00:43:10,005 --> 00:43:11,757
You ever spent two days or more

790
00:43:11,882 --> 00:43:14,968
locked up with one
of your customers before?

791
00:43:15,094 --> 00:43:17,096
- I can't say I have.
- Don't talk to my prisoner.

792
00:43:17,221 --> 00:43:18,639
I talk to my prisoner,
that's it.

793
00:43:18,764 --> 00:43:19,848
- You got it?
- I got it.

794
00:43:19,973 --> 00:43:21,141
Jolly good.

795
00:43:21,266 --> 00:43:22,893
You got anything in here
besides coffee

796
00:43:23,018 --> 00:43:24,770
that can help warm us up?

797
00:43:24,895 --> 00:43:27,064
Well, the bar is open.

798
00:43:27,189 --> 00:43:29,858
Follow moi.

799
00:43:42,329 --> 00:43:45,332
Line, O.B.!

800
00:43:45,457 --> 00:43:47,084
Oh, whoa.

801
00:43:47,209 --> 00:43:48,710
Oh.

802
00:43:50,462 --> 00:43:52,172
Whoa.

803
00:44:12,151 --> 00:44:13,652
Hey.

804
00:44:24,955 --> 00:44:27,541
Whoa, Ace, whoa.

805
00:44:27,666 --> 00:44:30,919
You're all right,
you're all right.

806
00:44:31,044 --> 00:44:32,796
Come on, goddamn it. I'm cold!

807
00:44:39,261 --> 00:44:41,346
I'll feed and water the horses.

808
00:44:41,471 --> 00:44:44,433
You go inside
and get some hot coffee.

809
00:44:44,558 --> 00:44:46,059
Got some stew cooking.

810
00:44:46,185 --> 00:44:47,227
Should be done soon.

811
00:44:47,352 --> 00:44:48,604
Now, look.

812
00:44:48,729 --> 00:44:52,107
No matter how bad
this blizzard gets,

813
00:44:52,232 --> 00:44:54,359
we still got to feed
these horses

814
00:44:54,484 --> 00:44:57,070
and take a squat
from time to time.

815
00:44:57,196 --> 00:45:00,282
So me and Chris
better lay out a line

816
00:45:00,407 --> 00:45:02,576
from the stable
to the front door

817
00:45:02,701 --> 00:45:05,579
and from the front door
to the shithouse.

818
00:45:05,704 --> 00:45:07,206
Okay?

819
00:45:10,626 --> 00:45:12,252
Good idea.

820
00:45:13,378 --> 00:45:15,005
Come on, Chris.

821
00:45:16,715 --> 00:45:18,175
I'll give you a hand.

822
00:45:19,718 --> 00:45:22,387
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
Go inside. Get warm.

823
00:45:22,512 --> 00:45:24,348
You're doin' stable work
in a goddamn blizzard.

824
00:45:24,473 --> 00:45:26,183
I offer to help, you say no?

825
00:45:27,768 --> 00:45:29,811
You're right, amigo.

826
00:45:29,937 --> 00:45:31,813
Muchas gracias.

827
00:45:34,024 --> 00:45:35,901
All right. Follow me.

828
00:45:46,787 --> 00:45:50,499
We're gonna drop one
every ten paces,

829
00:45:50,624 --> 00:45:52,209
-from here to the door.
- Yeah!

830
00:45:52,334 --> 00:45:54,127
All right!

831
00:46:53,812 --> 00:46:57,357
Now, you're wanted for murder.

832
00:46:57,482 --> 00:46:59,526
For the sake of my analogy,

833
00:46:59,651 --> 00:47:01,695
let's just assume
that you did it.

834
00:47:01,820 --> 00:47:03,905
Now, John Ruth wants
to take you back to Red Rock

835
00:47:04,031 --> 00:47:05,949
to stand trial for murder.

836
00:47:06,074 --> 00:47:09,202
And if you're found guilty,

837
00:47:09,328 --> 00:47:10,912
the people of Red Rock

838
00:47:11,038 --> 00:47:12,956
will hang you
in the town square.

839
00:47:13,081 --> 00:47:14,875
And, as the hangman,

840
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:18,211
I will perform the execution.

841
00:47:18,337 --> 00:47:20,922
And if all those things

842
00:47:21,048 --> 00:47:22,883
end up taking place,

843
00:47:23,008 --> 00:47:26,011
that's what civilized society

844
00:47:26,136 --> 00:47:29,431
calls justice.

845
00:47:29,556 --> 00:47:31,433
However,

846
00:47:31,558 --> 00:47:34,728
if the relatives
and the loved ones

847
00:47:34,853 --> 00:47:36,605
of the person you murdered

848
00:47:36,730 --> 00:47:38,273
were outside that door
right now,

849
00:47:38,398 --> 00:47:40,734
and after busting down
that door,

850
00:47:40,859 --> 00:47:43,278
they drug you out into the snow

851
00:47:43,403 --> 00:47:45,447
and hung you up by the neck,

852
00:47:45,572 --> 00:47:48,909
that would be frontier justice.

853
00:47:49,034 --> 00:47:51,953
Now, the good part

854
00:47:52,079 --> 00:47:53,789
about frontier justice

855
00:47:53,914 --> 00:47:57,542
is it's very thirst-quenching.

856
00:47:57,667 --> 00:48:02,130
The bad part is
it's apt to be wrong as right.

857
00:48:02,255 --> 00:48:03,548
Well, not in your case.

858
00:48:03,673 --> 00:48:05,008
In your case,
you'd have it coming.

859
00:48:05,133 --> 00:48:08,261
But other people,
maybe not so much.

860
00:48:08,387 --> 00:48:10,806
But ultimately,
what's the real difference

861
00:48:10,931 --> 00:48:12,391
between the two?

862
00:48:12,516 --> 00:48:16,144
The real difference is me.

863
00:48:16,269 --> 00:48:17,771
The hangman.

864
00:48:17,896 --> 00:48:19,648
To me, it doesn't matter
what you did.

865
00:48:19,773 --> 00:48:21,983
When I hang you, I'll get no
satisfaction from your death.

866
00:48:22,109 --> 00:48:23,193
It's my job.

867
00:48:23,318 --> 00:48:24,778
I hang you in Red Rock.

868
00:48:24,903 --> 00:48:26,613
I move on to the next town.

869
00:48:26,738 --> 00:48:30,575
I hang someone else there.

870
00:48:30,700 --> 00:48:34,788
The man who pulls the lever
that breaks your neck

871
00:48:34,913 --> 00:48:37,791
will be a dispassionate man.

872
00:48:37,916 --> 00:48:42,212
And that dispassion
is the very essence ofjustice.

873
00:48:42,337 --> 00:48:46,133
For justice delivered
without dis-passion

874
00:48:46,258 --> 00:48:50,887
is always in danger
of not being justice.

875
00:48:51,012 --> 00:48:52,389
Amen

876
00:49:17,664 --> 00:49:19,082
No offense, cowboy fella.

877
00:49:19,207 --> 00:49:22,127
Just gettin' your attention.

878
00:49:22,252 --> 00:49:25,630
Yeah, well...

879
00:49:25,755 --> 00:49:27,674
YOU got it.

880
00:49:27,799 --> 00:49:30,427
What you writin', friend?

881
00:49:30,552 --> 00:49:32,846
Only thing I'm qualified
to write about.

882
00:49:32,971 --> 00:49:35,140
What's that?

883
00:49:35,265 --> 00:49:37,225
My life story.

884
00:49:37,350 --> 00:49:39,060
You're writing your life story?

885
00:49:39,186 --> 00:49:40,562
You bet I am.

886
00:49:40,687 --> 00:49:42,022
Am I in it?

887
00:49:44,107 --> 00:49:45,734
You just entered.

888
00:49:47,235 --> 00:49:48,862
Well, you like writing stories
so much,

889
00:49:48,987 --> 00:49:51,198
why don't you tell me
the story that brings you here?

890
00:49:52,491 --> 00:49:54,034
Who's asking?

891
00:49:54,159 --> 00:49:56,036
I am. John Ruth.

892
00:49:56,161 --> 00:49:58,580
I'm bringing in this one
to Red Rock to hang.

893
00:49:58,705 --> 00:50:00,874
And ain't no way I'm spending
a couple of nights

894
00:50:00,999 --> 00:50:03,293
under a roof with somebody
I don't know who they are,

895
00:50:03,418 --> 00:50:04,920
and I don't know who you are.

896
00:50:05,045 --> 00:50:07,005
So, who are you?

897
00:50:07,130 --> 00:50:09,007
Joe Gage.

898
00:50:09,132 --> 00:50:11,092
- What?
- That's my name.

899
00:50:11,218 --> 00:50:12,385
Joe Gage.

900
00:50:12,511 --> 00:50:14,304
Okay, Joe Gage.

901
00:50:14,429 --> 00:50:16,181
Why you going to Red Rock?

902
00:50:16,306 --> 00:50:18,308
I ain't, I ain't,
I ain't going to Red Rock.

903
00:50:18,433 --> 00:50:19,893
Where you going?

904
00:50:20,018 --> 00:50:21,937
About nine miles
outside of Red Rock.

905
00:50:22,062 --> 00:50:23,104
What's there?

906
00:50:23,230 --> 00:50:24,564
My mother.

907
00:50:25,690 --> 00:50:26,942
Your mother?

908
00:50:27,067 --> 00:50:29,110
Listen, I'm just a cowpuncher.

909
00:50:29,236 --> 00:50:33,281
I just, uh, got back
from a long drive, and...

910
00:50:33,406 --> 00:50:37,911
and I wasn'tjust an ass
in a saddle this time.

911
00:50:38,036 --> 00:50:40,413
I was a partner.

912
00:50:40,539 --> 00:50:44,334
First time in my life
I made a pretty penny.

913
00:50:44,459 --> 00:50:46,002
And, uh,

914
00:50:46,127 --> 00:50:48,505
figured I'd come home

915
00:50:48,630 --> 00:50:50,340
and spend time with my mother

916
00:50:50,465 --> 00:50:52,175
for Christmas.

917
00:50:52,300 --> 00:50:53,802
Now, that's funny.

918
00:50:55,178 --> 00:50:56,930
'Cause you don't look like

919
00:50:57,055 --> 00:50:58,640
the coming-home-for-Christmas
type.

920
00:50:58,765 --> 00:51:02,310
Yeah, well,

921
00:51:02,435 --> 00:51:05,522
you know,
looks can be deceiving.

922
00:51:07,566 --> 00:51:10,527
Because I definitely am a

923
00:51:10,652 --> 00:51:14,531
coming-home-for-Christmas-
to-spend-time-with-Mother type.

924
00:51:15,824 --> 00:51:19,953
Christmas with Mother,
I mean, uh,

925
00:51:20,078 --> 00:51:22,080
it's a wonderful thing.

926
00:51:23,623 --> 00:51:26,001
Now, is that, uh,

927
00:51:26,126 --> 00:51:27,794
good enough for you,

928
00:51:27,919 --> 00:51:30,213
John Ruth?

929
00:51:31,464 --> 00:51:33,466
For now.

930
00:51:33,592 --> 00:51:36,136
You steer clear of my prisoner.

931
00:51:40,515 --> 00:51:42,642
Hello, old-timer.

932
00:51:44,603 --> 00:51:46,187
General.

933
00:51:47,439 --> 00:51:48,857
General.

934
00:51:50,358 --> 00:51:53,695
You, sir, are a hyena.

935
00:51:55,530 --> 00:51:57,824
I have no wish to speak to you.

936
00:52:02,454 --> 00:52:04,581
I've been called worse.

937
00:52:06,666 --> 00:52:08,835
Fair enough, General.

938
00:52:10,128 --> 00:52:11,755
Sorry to bother you.

939
00:52:13,798 --> 00:52:15,342
Hey!

940
00:52:15,467 --> 00:52:17,218
- You gotta kick it open!
- Gotta kick it open!

941
00:52:17,344 --> 00:52:19,054
- What?
- Kick it open!

942
00:52:19,179 --> 00:52:21,222
- That latch, you gotta kick it
open! -You gotta kick it open!

943
00:52:22,307 --> 00:52:23,516
Jesus Christ!

944
00:52:23,642 --> 00:52:25,018
- Close it!
- Close it!

945
00:52:25,143 --> 00:52:26,436
- Close the door!
- What?

946
00:52:26,561 --> 00:52:28,021
- Close it!
- The goddamn door!

947
00:52:28,146 --> 00:52:29,356
It doesn't have a latch.
Close it!

948
00:52:29,481 --> 00:52:30,857
It's already cold enough
in here!

949
00:52:34,903 --> 00:52:36,613
Doesn't have a latch.

950
00:52:36,738 --> 00:52:38,531
- You gotta hammer up a board.
- You gotta nail it shut!

951
00:52:38,657 --> 00:52:39,908
The hammer and nails
by the door.

952
00:52:40,033 --> 00:52:42,535
There's a hammer
and nails right there!

953
00:52:42,661 --> 00:52:44,788
Ah, God!

954
00:52:44,913 --> 00:52:47,248
- Hold this here, Chris.
- Here! Here.

955
00:52:55,048 --> 00:52:56,466
- Watch your fingers.
- Yeah.

956
00:52:56,591 --> 00:52:58,343
- Really nail it in!
- Yeah.

957
00:53:00,970 --> 00:53:02,681
You need two pieces of wood.

958
00:53:02,806 --> 00:53:04,557
You got to hammer another one.

959
00:53:04,683 --> 00:53:06,434
One ain't good enough!

960
00:53:06,559 --> 00:53:08,478
It's gonna blow right open!

961
00:53:08,603 --> 00:53:09,688
Now, goddamn it!

962
00:53:09,813 --> 00:53:11,564
Gonna open if you don't ham...!

963
00:53:11,690 --> 00:53:13,233
- Shut up!
- Ah, got it!

964
00:53:13,358 --> 00:53:15,652
Son of a bitch!

965
00:53:27,455 --> 00:53:28,790
Jesus Christ.

966
00:53:28,915 --> 00:53:30,792
That's door's a whore.

967
00:53:33,545 --> 00:53:34,879
Oh.

968
00:53:35,004 --> 00:53:36,631
I get it. "Haberdashery."

969
00:53:36,756 --> 00:53:38,591
That was a joke.

970
00:53:38,717 --> 00:53:41,010
How's the coffee?

971
00:53:41,136 --> 00:53:44,681
Now? Pretty good,
if I do say so myself.

972
00:53:47,225 --> 00:53:48,768
Thank you.

973
00:53:51,146 --> 00:53:53,857
Ooh!

974
00:54:03,324 --> 00:54:05,660
Ha! Navajo!

975
00:54:05,785 --> 00:54:07,537
Guess who he is.

976
00:54:09,456 --> 00:54:11,708
Buffalo Bill?

977
00:54:11,833 --> 00:54:13,460
Hardly.

978
00:54:13,585 --> 00:54:15,295
No. I'm...

979
00:54:15,420 --> 00:54:17,130
Oswaldo Mobray. I'm the...

980
00:54:17,255 --> 00:54:19,299
He's the hangman of Red Rock.

981
00:54:20,383 --> 00:54:21,551
Oh, you are?

982
00:54:21,676 --> 00:54:23,720
- Yes, I am.
- Well!

983
00:54:23,845 --> 00:54:26,389
- Uh, good to meet you, uh,
- Yeah.

984
00:54:26,514 --> 00:54:27,974
- Mr...?
- Uh, Mobray.

985
00:54:28,099 --> 00:54:29,142
- Mobray.
- Yeah.

986
00:54:29,267 --> 00:54:30,310
I'm Chris Mannix.

987
00:54:30,435 --> 00:54:31,853
The new sheriff in Red Rock.

988
00:54:31,978 --> 00:54:34,189
- Really?
- Pfft, horseshit!

989
00:54:34,314 --> 00:54:35,774
Pay no attention to him.

990
00:54:35,899 --> 00:54:37,358
Horseshit!

991
00:54:37,484 --> 00:54:39,152
Fella warmin' himself
by that potbelly stove

992
00:54:39,277 --> 00:54:41,780
-is a hell of a driver
named O.B. -Ah.

993
00:54:41,905 --> 00:54:44,324
That's the only thing
you've said that's the truth.

994
00:54:45,909 --> 00:54:47,994
You comin' into Red Rock
to hang Lance Lawson?

995
00:54:48,119 --> 00:54:50,163
- Precisely. -Do you have
the execution orders on you?

996
00:54:50,288 --> 00:54:51,873
- In my bag.
- May I see 'em?

997
00:54:51,998 --> 00:54:53,583
Of course.

998
00:54:58,713 --> 00:55:00,924
Who's, uh, who's Lance Lawson?

999
00:55:01,049 --> 00:55:03,426
He's a fella been sittin'
in the Red Rock jail

1000
00:55:03,551 --> 00:55:05,053
about a month now.

1001
00:55:05,178 --> 00:55:07,222
He's the fella
who shot the fella

1002
00:55:07,347 --> 00:55:09,891
who was sheriff 'fore me.

1003
00:55:10,016 --> 00:55:12,268
Precisely.

1004
00:55:13,978 --> 00:55:16,064
Thank you.

1005
00:55:21,361 --> 00:55:23,947
What did she mean
when she said,

1006
00:55:24,072 --> 00:55:26,908
"The bounty hunter's
nigger friend in the stable"?

1007
00:55:27,033 --> 00:55:30,286
He's got a nigger bounty hunter
friend in the stable.

1008
00:55:30,411 --> 00:55:32,539
But all that just to guard her?

1009
00:55:32,664 --> 00:55:35,792
Uh, I don't think that was
the original idea, but...

1010
00:55:35,917 --> 00:55:38,503
-that's the idea now.
- Oh. Mm.

1011
00:55:38,628 --> 00:55:40,922
Want a little snake bite
in your coffee?

1012
00:55:41,047 --> 00:55:42,799
Yeah.

1013
00:55:42,924 --> 00:55:44,425
Five of you?

1014
00:55:44,551 --> 00:55:46,553
Well, well, well, looks
like Minnie's Haberdashery

1015
00:55:46,678 --> 00:55:49,097
is about to get cozy
for the next few days.

1016
00:55:49,222 --> 00:55:50,723
Yes, it does.

1017
00:55:54,394 --> 00:55:55,812
- Here.
- Ah. Ah.

1018
00:55:59,858 --> 00:56:03,069
Are you the chap
with the Lincoln letter?

1019
00:56:03,194 --> 00:56:04,988
The Lincoln what?

1020
00:56:05,113 --> 00:56:08,616
Yes. The letter
from Abraham Lincoln.

1021
00:56:08,741 --> 00:56:10,743
President Abraham Lincoln?

1022
00:56:10,869 --> 00:56:13,621
Yes. Weren't you pen pals?

1023
00:56:13,746 --> 00:56:15,957
With the president?

1024
00:56:16,082 --> 00:56:19,085
Well, I'm sorry, I heard
that somebody in your party

1025
00:56:19,210 --> 00:56:20,962
had a letter
from Abraham Lincoln.

1026
00:56:21,087 --> 00:56:22,547
I assumed it was you.

1027
00:56:22,672 --> 00:56:23,965
Not him!

1028
00:56:24,090 --> 00:56:26,759
Black fella in the stable.

1029
00:56:26,885 --> 00:56:28,344
The nigger...

1030
00:56:28,469 --> 00:56:31,764
in the stable has a letter
from Abraham Lincoln?

1031
00:56:31,890 --> 00:56:33,516
Yeah.

1032
00:56:33,641 --> 00:56:38,354
The nigger in the stable has
a letter from Abraham Lincoln?

1033
00:56:53,411 --> 00:56:55,663
What'd you say
your name was again?

1034
00:56:55,788 --> 00:56:57,665
- Bob.
- Warren.

1035
00:56:57,790 --> 00:57:00,043
Minnie and Sweet Dave in there?

1036
00:57:00,168 --> 00:57:02,295
Minnie and Sweet Dave went
to visit her mother

1037
00:57:02,420 --> 00:57:04,172
on the north side
of the mountain.

1038
00:57:04,297 --> 00:57:05,715
- What?
- Yeah.

1039
00:57:05,840 --> 00:57:07,175
Minnie ain't here?

1040
00:57:07,300 --> 00:57:09,802
Yes, they're visiting
her mother.

1041
00:57:09,928 --> 00:57:12,013
- Her mother?
- Yes.

1042
00:57:12,138 --> 00:57:13,556
Hmm.

1043
00:57:15,141 --> 00:57:17,435
Never knew Minnie had a mother.

1044
00:57:19,646 --> 00:57:22,523
Well, everybody's got a mother.

1045
00:57:24,025 --> 00:57:25,944
Yeah, I suppose.

1046
00:57:28,821 --> 00:57:30,990
And she left you in charge?

1047
00:57:31,115 --> 00:57:32,492
Si.

1048
00:57:34,619 --> 00:57:37,664
That sure don't sound
like Minnie.

1049
00:57:37,789 --> 00:57:40,041
Are you calling me a liar?

1050
00:57:42,001 --> 00:57:44,462
Well, not yet I ain't.

1051
00:57:44,587 --> 00:57:46,839
Just sounds peculiar is all.

1052
00:57:46,965 --> 00:57:48,841
What sounds peculiar?

1053
00:57:48,967 --> 00:57:51,010
Well, first off,
Minnie never struck me

1054
00:57:51,135 --> 00:57:52,929
as the sentimental type.

1055
00:57:53,054 --> 00:57:56,849
And secondly, I can't imagine
Sweet Dave lifting his fat ass

1056
00:57:56,975 --> 00:57:58,685
out his chair long enough
to fetch well water

1057
00:57:58,810 --> 00:58:01,062
unless Minnie was laying
a frying pan upside his head,

1058
00:58:01,187 --> 00:58:03,189
let alone take a trip
to the north side.

1059
00:58:03,314 --> 00:58:05,566
Well, that sounds a whole lot

1060
00:58:05,692 --> 00:58:08,277
like you're calling me a liar,
mi negro amigo.

1061
00:58:10,154 --> 00:58:12,031
Yeah, it do sound a whole lot
like that, don't it?

1062
00:58:13,616 --> 00:58:16,285
But I still ain't done it yet.

1063
00:58:17,370 --> 00:58:20,373
Minnie still serve food?

1064
00:58:20,498 --> 00:58:23,209
- Do you consider stew food?
- Yes.

1065
00:58:23,334 --> 00:58:24,961
Then we serve food.

1066
00:58:25,086 --> 00:58:28,673
She still stinking up the place
with Old Quail pipe tobacco?

1067
00:58:32,677 --> 00:58:35,430
Minnie doesn't smoke a pipe.

1068
00:58:35,555 --> 00:58:37,640
She rolls her own.

1069
00:58:37,765 --> 00:58:40,309
Red Apple Tobacco.

1070
00:58:40,435 --> 00:58:44,439
But, mi negro amigo,
I think you already know this.

1071
00:58:44,564 --> 00:58:46,733
Yeah, I do, Senor Bob.

1072
00:58:46,858 --> 00:58:49,402
Just seeing if you do.

1073
00:59:06,210 --> 00:59:07,712
Come on!

1074
00:59:31,986 --> 00:59:33,279
Fill 'er up, O.B.

1075
00:59:33,404 --> 00:59:35,239
Yeah.

1076
00:59:35,364 --> 00:59:37,325
Goddamn it.

1077
00:59:39,118 --> 00:59:40,536
Thank you.

1078
00:59:48,419 --> 00:59:51,839
Well, cut my legs off
and call me Shorty.

1079
00:59:51,964 --> 00:59:55,259
Is that
General Sanford Smithers I see?

1080
00:59:56,928 --> 00:59:58,971
You got a good eye, son.

1081
00:59:59,097 --> 01:00:03,226
Ha-ha! Well, I'll be
double-dog damned!

1082
01:00:03,351 --> 01:00:05,353
General Sandy
"Don't Give a Damn" Smithers?

1083
01:00:08,606 --> 01:00:10,858
Captain Chris Mannix,
Mannix's Marauders.

1084
01:00:10,983 --> 01:00:12,485
Erskine's boy?

1085
01:00:12,610 --> 01:00:14,278
Yes, sir.

1086
01:00:14,403 --> 01:00:17,490
Uh... may I sit down, sir?

1087
01:00:17,615 --> 01:00:20,326
Well, according to the Yankees,
it's a free country.

1088
01:00:20,451 --> 01:00:23,663
General Sandy Smithers. Ha-ha!

1089
01:00:23,788 --> 01:00:25,998
BOY- - '

1090
01:00:26,124 --> 01:00:27,625
oh, boy,

1091
01:00:27,750 --> 01:00:31,045
did my daddy talk about you!

1092
01:00:31,170 --> 01:00:34,841
I heard you gave
those Blue Bellies sweet hell.

1093
01:00:36,634 --> 01:00:38,719
Me and my boys did our part.

1094
01:00:38,845 --> 01:00:41,222
Just like Erskine and his boys
did their part.

1095
01:00:41,347 --> 01:00:43,141
Hell yeah, we did.

1096
01:00:43,266 --> 01:00:45,309
Yankee sons of bitches.

1097
01:00:45,434 --> 01:00:48,771
I never knew your father, son.

1098
01:00:48,896 --> 01:00:53,359
But I always respected
his resolve.

1099
01:00:53,484 --> 01:00:55,528
Well, thank you
for saying that, General.

1100
01:00:55,653 --> 01:00:58,364
Your respect would have meant
the world to him.

1101
01:01:00,032 --> 01:01:02,785
Can I get you some coffee?

1102
01:01:02,910 --> 01:01:04,537
That'd be nice.

1103
01:01:04,662 --> 01:01:06,706
Well, how about a blanket?

1104
01:01:08,249 --> 01:01:10,168
That'd be even nicer.

1105
01:01:10,293 --> 01:01:13,004
Hell, you know what?
You can have mine.

1106
01:01:16,382 --> 01:01:18,384
Here we go, General.

1107
01:01:20,011 --> 01:01:23,097
Ha-ha! So what brings you
out Wyoming way, sir?

1108
01:01:23,222 --> 01:01:25,057
If you don't mind my askin'.

1109
01:01:25,183 --> 01:01:26,976
My boy.

1110
01:01:27,101 --> 01:01:30,688
- Oh, you got a boy that lives
in Red Rock? -My son.

1111
01:01:31,772 --> 01:01:34,233
Chester Charles Smithers.

1112
01:01:34,358 --> 01:01:37,737
He died out here
a few years back.

1113
01:01:37,862 --> 01:01:39,947
Oh, forgive me, sir.

1114
01:01:40,072 --> 01:01:42,366
There's no forgiveness
needed,son.

1115
01:01:43,701 --> 01:01:46,871
Like I said,
it was a few years back.

1116
01:01:46,996 --> 01:01:49,665
It was after
he'd served his service.

1117
01:01:51,709 --> 01:01:56,005
He came out here
to the hills of Wyoming...

1118
01:01:56,130 --> 01:01:57,924
to make his fortune.

1119
01:01:59,383 --> 01:02:02,762
Never to be heard from again.

1120
01:02:08,226 --> 01:02:12,271
I bought him a symbolic plot...

1121
01:02:12,396 --> 01:02:15,650
in the Red Rock cemetery.

1122
01:02:15,775 --> 01:02:20,112
And I'm hereto advise
a stone maker on his headstone.

1123
01:02:20,238 --> 01:02:22,657
Was he a goner for sure?

1124
01:02:22,782 --> 01:02:24,825
No chance he could be livin'
the cold life

1125
01:02:24,951 --> 01:02:26,327
out in the woods?

1126
01:02:26,452 --> 01:02:29,247
It's a rough life,
but folks can learn it.

1127
01:02:29,372 --> 01:02:32,792
If he'd have done
what he came out hereto do,

1128
01:02:32,917 --> 01:02:35,211
he'd have come home.

1129
01:02:36,963 --> 01:02:39,382
Hold it. Close it, close it!

1130
01:02:42,635 --> 01:02:45,429
You have to hold it closed
while I nail it shut.

1131
01:02:45,554 --> 01:02:47,765
Well, who's the idiot
broke the damn door?

1132
01:02:47,890 --> 01:02:49,350
(stamrrjélfingY
Oh! J-J-J' "...

1133
01:02:49,475 --> 01:02:51,811
just fucking hold it closed!

1134
01:02:53,062 --> 01:02:55,189
Orale, cabron!

1135
01:02:57,483 --> 01:02:59,860
Hold it closed.

1136
01:02:59,986 --> 01:03:01,529
Okay.

1137
01:03:01,654 --> 01:03:03,239
One more.

1138
01:03:06,284 --> 01:03:09,036
Keep holding, keep holding,

1139
01:03:09,161 --> 01:03:11,038
my negro amigo.

1140
01:03:13,291 --> 01:03:16,168
We need two pieces of wood.

1141
01:03:18,921 --> 01:03:21,173
Orale, cabron!
All right.

1142
01:03:21,299 --> 01:03:23,759
There you go, motherfucker!

1143
01:03:27,471 --> 01:03:29,682
Lot of hats, Senor Bob.

1144
01:03:29,807 --> 01:03:31,309
Huh?

1145
01:03:31,434 --> 01:03:33,394
Considering Minnie's
"no hats indoors" policy,

1146
01:03:33,519 --> 01:03:35,438
which, if I remember correctly,

1147
01:03:35,563 --> 01:03:37,481
was one of them
Bar of Iron rules.

1148
01:03:37,606 --> 01:03:40,192
Kind of rule she'd want kept up
in her absence.

1149
01:03:40,318 --> 01:03:42,194
You seem to have
a laissez-faire attitude

1150
01:03:42,320 --> 01:03:44,196
when it come to the hats.

1151
01:03:44,322 --> 01:03:45,698
I'm guilty.

1152
01:03:45,823 --> 01:03:48,492
I have a laissez-faire attitude
about the hats.

1153
01:03:48,617 --> 01:03:51,037
How about we forget
about the hats today

1154
01:03:51,162 --> 01:03:53,956
considering there is
a blizzard going on and on?

1155
01:03:54,081 --> 01:03:56,459
We'll make tomorrow

Yes, sir.
I agree with that.

Do you know that nigger, sir?

1178
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:05,194
I don't know that nigger.

1179
01:05:05,319 --> 01:05:09,740
But I know he's a nigger,
and that's all I need to know.

1180
01:05:18,624 --> 01:05:20,084
Well...

1181
01:05:20,209 --> 01:05:22,294
that nigger
just ain't any nigger.

1182
01:05:22,420 --> 01:05:23,838
That nigger, he...

1183
01:05:23,963 --> 01:05:25,297
General Sanford Smithers?

1184
01:05:25,423 --> 01:05:27,800
Battle of Baton Rouge?

1185
01:05:31,137 --> 01:05:32,805
Inform the nigger

1186
01:05:32,930 --> 01:05:35,933
in the cavalry
officer's uniform

1187
01:05:36,058 --> 01:05:38,727
that I had
a division of Confederates

1188
01:05:38,853 --> 01:05:41,063
under my command...

1189
01:05:41,188 --> 01:05:43,107
in Baton Rouge.

1190
01:05:43,232 --> 01:05:45,943
Major Nigger, General Smithers
wishes me to inform you...

1191
01:05:46,068 --> 01:05:48,654
I heard him, hillbilly.

1192
01:05:48,779 --> 01:05:53,325
Inform this old cracker
that I was in Baton Rouge also.

1193
01:05:53,451 --> 01:05:54,869
On the other side.

1194
01:05:56,495 --> 01:05:58,372
Oh, that's interesting.

1195
01:05:58,497 --> 01:06:00,332
Uh, General Smithers,

1196
01:06:00,458 --> 01:06:03,461
he said that he was also in
Baton Rouge on the other si...

1197
01:06:03,586 --> 01:06:05,087
Captain Mannix,

1198
01:06:05,212 --> 01:06:07,047
tell the nigger

1199
01:06:07,173 --> 01:06:09,508
that I don't
acknowledge niggers

1200
01:06:09,633 --> 01:06:11,177
in Northern uniforms.

1201
01:06:11,302 --> 01:06:13,179
You captured
a whole colored command

1202
01:06:13,304 --> 01:06:14,972
that day...

1203
01:06:15,097 --> 01:06:18,350
but not one colored trooper
made it to a camp, did they?

1204
01:06:18,476 --> 01:06:20,853
We didn't have the time
or the food...

1205
01:06:20,978 --> 01:06:24,023
nor the inclination...

1206
01:06:24,148 --> 01:06:26,525
to care for Northern horses

1207
01:06:26,650 --> 01:06:28,861
and least of all...

1208
01:06:28,986 --> 01:06:30,946
Northern niggers!

1209
01:06:31,071 --> 01:06:32,698
So we shot 'em
where they stood!

1210
01:06:32,823 --> 01:06:35,201
Gentlemen.

1211
01:06:35,326 --> 01:06:38,245
Gentlemen.

1212
01:06:38,370 --> 01:06:40,956
I know Americans aren't apt

1213
01:06:41,081 --> 01:06:43,918
to let a little thing
like unconditional surrender

1214
01:06:44,043 --> 01:06:46,670
get in the way of a good war.

1215
01:06:46,795 --> 01:06:49,548
But I strongly suggest
we don't restage

1216
01:06:49,673 --> 01:06:52,009
the Battle of Baton Rouge

1217
01:06:52,134 --> 01:06:54,678
during a blizzard
in Minnie's Haberdashery.

1218
01:06:56,347 --> 01:06:58,015
Now, uh...

1219
01:06:58,140 --> 01:07:00,226
my Nubian friend...

1220
01:07:00,351 --> 01:07:03,103
while I realize
passions are high,

1221
01:07:03,229 --> 01:07:05,189
that was a while ago.

1222
01:07:05,314 --> 01:07:08,651
And if you shoot
this unarmed old man,

1223
01:07:08,776 --> 01:07:11,737
I guarantee
I will hang you by the neck

1224
01:07:11,862 --> 01:07:15,574
until you are dead
once we arrive in Red Rock.

1225
01:07:19,537 --> 01:07:21,705
I damn well
guarantee that, too.

1226
01:07:21,830 --> 01:07:23,207
Yeah, Warren,

1227
01:07:23,332 --> 01:07:24,959
that's the problem
with old men.

1228
01:07:25,084 --> 01:07:26,919
You can kick 'em
down the stairs

1229
01:07:27,044 --> 01:07:30,422
and say it's a accident,
but you can't just shoot 'em.

1230
01:07:30,548 --> 01:07:33,300
Uh, gentlemen...
since we may be

1231
01:07:33,425 --> 01:07:35,427
trapped here,

1232
01:07:35,553 --> 01:07:37,429
close together-like,

1233
01:07:37,555 --> 01:07:39,765
for a few days,

1234
01:07:39,890 --> 01:07:43,269
may I suggest
a possible solution?

1235
01:07:44,562 --> 01:07:47,481
We divide Minnie's in half.

1236
01:07:47,606 --> 01:07:49,650
The Northern side

1237
01:07:49,775 --> 01:07:52,278
and the Southern side.

1238
01:07:52,403 --> 01:07:55,155
With the dinner table...

1239
01:07:55,281 --> 01:07:57,575
operating as a...

1240
01:07:57,700 --> 01:07:59,577
neutral territory.

1241
01:07:59,702 --> 01:08:02,663
We could say
that the fireplace...

1242
01:08:02,788 --> 01:08:05,165
side of the room acts as a...

1243
01:08:05,291 --> 01:08:09,086
a symbolic representative of...

1244
01:08:09,211 --> 01:08:10,713
Georgia.

1245
01:08:12,590 --> 01:08:14,883
While the bar...

1246
01:08:15,009 --> 01:08:16,635
represents...

1247
01:08:20,431 --> 01:08:22,600
...Philadelphia!

1248
01:08:22,725 --> 01:08:25,728
Long as the bar's
Philadelphia...

1249
01:08:25,853 --> 01:08:27,771
I agree.

1250
01:08:35,112 --> 01:08:37,990
We still got that deal
we talked about in the wagon?

1251
01:08:38,115 --> 01:08:41,160
Thank you. -I help you
protect your $8,000,

1252
01:08:41,285 --> 01:08:44,663
-you help me protect my ten?
- Yeah, I suppose.

1253
01:08:45,748 --> 01:08:47,541
One of them fellas

1254
01:08:47,666 --> 01:08:51,170
is not what he says he is.

1255
01:08:51,295 --> 01:08:52,796
What is he?

1256
01:08:52,921 --> 01:08:55,924
In cahoots with this one,
that's what he is.

1257
01:08:56,050 --> 01:08:58,636
One of them,
maybe even two of them,

1258
01:08:58,761 --> 01:09:01,889
is here to see
Domergue goes free.

1259
01:09:02,014 --> 01:09:06,560
To accomplish that goal,
they'll kill everybody in here.

1260
01:09:06,685 --> 01:09:08,520
They got 'em a couple of days,

1261
01:09:08,646 --> 01:09:10,939
so all they got to do
is sit tight

1262
01:09:11,065 --> 01:09:14,443
and wait for a window
of opportunity.

1263
01:09:14,568 --> 01:09:17,112
And that's when they strike.

1264
01:09:18,822 --> 01:09:21,450
Huh, bitch?

1265
01:09:21,575 --> 01:09:24,078
If you say so, John.

1266
01:09:25,913 --> 01:09:28,248
Are you sure you
ain't just being paranoid?

1267
01:09:28,374 --> 01:09:31,251
Our best bet is
this duplicitous fella

1268
01:09:31,377 --> 01:09:34,296
ain't as cool a customer
as Daisy here.

1269
01:09:34,421 --> 01:09:37,049
He won't have
the leather patience it takes

1270
01:09:37,174 --> 01:09:39,885
to just sit here and... wait.

1271
01:09:40,010 --> 01:09:42,221
Waiting for an opportunity

1272
01:09:42,346 --> 01:09:45,557
and knowing it's the right one
isn't so easy.

1273
01:09:45,683 --> 01:09:47,434
He can't handle it,

1274
01:09:47,559 --> 01:09:49,478
he'll stop waitin'.

1275
01:09:49,603 --> 01:09:51,563
Try and create his opportunity,

1276
01:09:51,689 --> 01:09:54,900
and that's when Mr. Jumpy
reveals himself.

1277
01:09:55,025 --> 01:09:57,903
Now, what you got
to say about all this?

1278
01:09:58,028 --> 01:09:59,613
What do I got to say?

1279
01:09:59,738 --> 01:10:02,616
About John Ruth's ravings?

1280
01:10:02,741 --> 01:10:05,953
He's absolutely right.

1281
01:10:06,078 --> 01:10:10,290
Me and one
of them fellas is in cahoots.

1282
01:10:10,416 --> 01:10:13,585
We're just waiting
for everybody to go to sleep.

1283
01:10:13,711 --> 01:10:16,255
That's when
we're gonna kill y'all.

1284
01:10:18,549 --> 01:10:21,301
Okay, everybody.

1285
01:10:23,762 --> 01:10:26,432
Hear this.

1286
01:10:28,267 --> 01:10:30,310
This here is Daisy Domergue.

1287
01:10:31,812 --> 01:10:34,690
She's wanted dead or alive
for murder.

1288
01:10:34,815 --> 01:10:37,359
$10,000.

1289
01:10:37,484 --> 01:10:40,112
That money's mine, boys.

1290
01:10:40,237 --> 01:10:42,865
Don't want to share it,

1291
01:10:42,990 --> 01:10:45,284
and I ain't gonna lose it.

1292
01:10:46,368 --> 01:10:48,245
When that sun comes out,

1293
01:10:48,370 --> 01:10:52,249
I'm taking this woman
into Red Rock to hang.

1294
01:10:58,297 --> 01:10:59,798
Now...

1295
01:11:03,177 --> 01:11:05,888
...is there anybody here

1296
01:11:06,013 --> 01:11:09,057
committed to stoppin' me...

1297
01:11:09,183 --> 01:11:10,934
from doing that?

1298
01:11:21,403 --> 01:11:23,197
Really?

1299
01:11:23,322 --> 01:11:25,866
Nobody got a problem with this?

1300
01:11:31,538 --> 01:11:32,956
Well...

1301
01:11:33,081 --> 01:11:36,043
I guess that's
very fortunate for me.

1302
01:11:37,377 --> 01:11:38,837
However...

1303
01:11:38,962 --> 01:11:42,257
I hope you all understand

1304
01:11:42,382 --> 01:11:44,510
I can't just...

1305
01:11:44,635 --> 01:11:46,553
take your word.

1306
01:11:46,678 --> 01:11:49,306
Circumstances force me to...

1307
01:11:49,431 --> 01:11:51,475
take...

1308
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:53,769
precautions.

1309
01:11:53,894 --> 01:11:56,688
When you say...

1310
01:11:56,814 --> 01:11:59,525
"precautions"...

1311
01:11:59,650 --> 01:12:03,195
why do I feel that you mean me?

1312
01:12:03,320 --> 01:12:05,113
Because I'm gonna take
your gun, son.

1313
01:12:05,239 --> 01:12:06,782
You are?

1314
01:12:06,907 --> 01:12:08,367
Yes, I am.

1315
01:12:08,492 --> 01:12:11,703
- Nothing personal.
- Just mine?

1316
01:12:11,829 --> 01:12:14,498
Hangman's got himself
a gun, too.

1317
01:12:14,623 --> 01:12:18,293
I'll be dealing with his gun
after I deal with yours.

1318
01:12:25,592 --> 01:12:27,511
I feel kind of...

1319
01:12:27,636 --> 01:12:29,513
naked without it.

1320
01:12:29,638 --> 01:12:32,432
Oh, I still got mine.

1321
01:12:34,351 --> 01:12:36,436
I'll protect you.

1322
01:12:44,862 --> 01:12:47,114
A bastard's work is never done.

1323
01:12:47,239 --> 01:12:49,324
Huh, John Ruth?

1324
01:12:49,449 --> 01:12:52,452
That's right, Joe Gage.

1325
01:12:52,578 --> 01:12:54,830
- Now, give me the gun.
- If you want it...

1326
01:12:56,456 --> 01:12:58,417
...you're gonna have
to come and take...

1327
01:12:59,877 --> 01:13:01,753
Calm down.

1328
01:13:03,547 --> 01:13:06,508
Take your hand away
from your gun.

1329
01:13:09,928 --> 01:13:11,889
Blink if you're calm.

1330
01:13:13,015 --> 01:13:14,349
He blink?

1331
01:13:14,474 --> 01:13:15,809
He blinked.

1332
01:13:15,934 --> 01:13:19,104
Blink if you're
gonna remain calm.

1333
01:13:22,816 --> 01:13:24,484
He blinked.

1334
01:13:24,610 --> 01:13:26,403
Take his pistol.

1335
01:13:27,905 --> 01:13:29,990
I'm real sorry about this, son.

1336
01:13:31,909 --> 01:13:33,827
Like I said...

1337
01:13:33,952 --> 01:13:36,288
nothing personal, just...

1338
01:13:36,413 --> 01:13:38,582
a precaution.

1339
01:14:23,627 --> 01:14:25,712
Pretty sneaky.

1340
01:15:00,497 --> 01:15:03,041
Afraid the same applies
to you, too,

1341
01:15:03,166 --> 01:15:05,585
Mr... Mobray.

1342
01:15:05,711 --> 01:15:07,671
Ah, precautions must be taken

1343
01:15:07,796 --> 01:15:11,091
because life
is too sweet to lose.

1344
01:15:15,387 --> 01:15:17,806
Hand me that little bucket.

1345
01:15:28,191 --> 01:15:30,902
O.B.

1346
01:15:31,028 --> 01:15:33,405
Go to the outhouse.

1347
01:15:33,530 --> 01:15:37,159
Take this bucket and...
dump it down the shithole.

1348
01:15:39,244 --> 01:15:41,621
Why do I got to go outside?

1349
01:15:41,747 --> 01:15:43,415
Well, your jacket's already on,

1350
01:15:43,540 --> 01:15:46,501
and I sorta kinda trust you.

1351
01:16:18,200 --> 01:16:21,036
- Grab the other cup.
- Yeah, I got it.

1352
01:16:25,207 --> 01:16:27,292
After you, Major.

1353
01:16:43,934 --> 01:16:45,560
Okay.

1354
01:16:47,479 --> 01:16:50,565
I'm gonna cut you loose
while we eat.

1355
01:16:50,690 --> 01:16:54,069
Don't get any ideas.
I ain't goin' soft on ya.

1356
01:16:54,194 --> 01:16:56,988
Lift your ass
even one inch off that seat,

1357
01:16:57,114 --> 01:17:00,742
and I'll put a bullet
right in your goddamn throat.

1358
01:17:00,867 --> 01:17:03,120
Come here.

1359
01:17:20,470 --> 01:17:22,097
Oh.

1360
01:17:25,142 --> 01:17:27,561
So, Domergue...

1361
01:17:27,686 --> 01:17:30,814
I suppose this blizzard
counts as a stroke of luck

1362
01:17:30,939 --> 01:17:32,941
far as you're concerned.

1363
01:17:33,066 --> 01:17:35,026
You don't hear me
complainin', do ya?

1364
01:17:35,152 --> 01:17:37,279
No, I sure don't.

1365
01:17:45,036 --> 01:17:47,706
Well, how 'bout you, Oswaldo?

1366
01:17:49,249 --> 01:17:51,042
How 'bout me what?

1367
01:17:51,168 --> 01:17:52,544
Look...

1368
01:17:52,669 --> 01:17:54,754
considering all the things
I done for money,

1369
01:17:54,880 --> 01:17:56,756
I ain't one to judge, but...

1370
01:17:56,882 --> 01:17:59,134
don't you feel
just the least little bad

1371
01:17:59,259 --> 01:18:01,636
about hangin' a woman?

1372
01:18:01,761 --> 01:18:04,556
Well, until they invent
a trigger a woman can't pull,

1373
01:18:04,681 --> 01:18:07,893
if you're a hangman,
you're going to hang women.

1374
01:18:08,018 --> 01:18:09,477
Well, hell, Ozzie, I guess

1375
01:18:09,603 --> 01:18:11,771
I ain't never looked at it
like that before.

1376
01:18:11,897 --> 01:18:14,316
When it comes to some of them
mean bastards out there,

1377
01:18:14,441 --> 01:18:16,276
it's the only thing
does the job.

1378
01:18:16,401 --> 01:18:19,279
You really only need
to hang mean bastards.

1379
01:18:19,404 --> 01:18:22,365
But mean bastards,
you need to hang.

1380
01:18:30,957 --> 01:18:33,585
You goddamn son of a bitch!

1381
01:18:34,836 --> 01:18:36,922
I almost died out there!

1382
01:18:40,133 --> 01:18:43,845
I ain't ever...
going out in that shit

1383
01:18:43,970 --> 01:18:47,098
ever, ever again!

1384
01:19:08,954 --> 01:19:10,872
You okay, O.B.?

1385
01:19:10,997 --> 01:19:12,415
I'm fine.

1386
01:19:12,540 --> 01:19:14,334
I'll be fine.

1387
01:19:14,459 --> 01:19:17,462
I just need tq get warm.

1388
01:19:21,758 --> 01:19:24,010
You want some stew, O.B.?

1389
01:19:24,135 --> 01:19:25,637
Stew?

1390
01:19:25,762 --> 01:19:28,223
Later.

1391
01:19:30,767 --> 01:19:32,769
Oh, yeah.

1392
01:19:32,894 --> 01:19:34,854
That's nice.

1393
01:19:58,670 --> 01:20:00,380
So...

1394
01:20:00,505 --> 01:20:02,465
how you doing, Black Major?

1395
01:20:02,590 --> 01:20:04,551
I ain't in the mood,
Chris Mannix.

1396
01:20:04,676 --> 01:20:06,928
Leave me be
from your horseshit.

1397
01:20:08,471 --> 01:20:10,473
John Ruth says
you got a Lincoln letter.

1398
01:20:10,598 --> 01:20:13,518
I told you, jackass,
go hee-haw someplace else.

1399
01:20:13,643 --> 01:20:15,228
That's right, John.

1400
01:20:15,353 --> 01:20:17,272
You did say that, didn't you?

1401
01:20:17,397 --> 01:20:19,399
Yeah. I did.

1402
01:20:20,608 --> 01:20:23,320
So...

1403
01:20:23,445 --> 01:20:26,031
you got a letter
from Abraham Lincoln?

1404
01:20:26,156 --> 01:20:27,699
Yes.

1405
01:20:27,824 --> 01:20:30,535
The... Abraham Lincoln?

1406
01:20:30,660 --> 01:20:31,870
Yes.

1407
01:20:31,995 --> 01:20:33,371
Abraham Lincoln?

1408
01:20:33,496 --> 01:20:35,290
The president
of the United States?

1409
01:20:35,415 --> 01:20:37,208
Yes.

1410
01:20:37,334 --> 01:20:38,209
Of America?

1411
01:20:38,335 --> 01:20:39,377
Yes.

1412
01:20:39,502 --> 01:20:41,713
Wrote you a letter...

1413
01:20:41,838 --> 01:20:43,131
Personally?

1414
01:20:43,256 --> 01:20:44,507
Yes.

1415
01:20:44,632 --> 01:20:46,760
Personally,
as in "Dear Major Warren"?

1416
01:20:46,885 --> 01:20:49,095
No, personally,
as in "Dear Marquis."

1417
01:20:49,220 --> 01:20:50,347
"Dear Marquis"?

1418
01:20:50,472 --> 01:20:51,806
Abraham Lincoln,

1419
01:20:51,931 --> 01:20:53,600
the president of
the United States of America?

1420
01:20:53,725 --> 01:20:54,851
Yes.

1421
01:20:54,976 --> 01:20:56,853
May I see it?

1422
01:20:56,978 --> 01:20:58,605
No, you may not.

1423
01:20:59,689 --> 01:21:01,608
But the way John tells it,

1424
01:21:01,733 --> 01:21:03,443
you weren't
jUSt some random nigger soldier

1425
01:21:03,568 --> 01:21:05,612
picked from a pile of letters.

1426
01:21:05,737 --> 01:21:08,823
Way John tells it...

1427
01:21:08,948 --> 01:21:10,867
y'all had a correspondence.

1428
01:21:10,992 --> 01:21:12,243
Yes.

1429
01:21:12,369 --> 01:21:14,412
The way John tells it...

1430
01:21:14,537 --> 01:21:18,083
y'all was practically pen pals.

1431
01:21:18,208 --> 01:21:20,502
Yes.

1432
01:21:20,627 --> 01:21:23,546
And a pen pal's...

1433
01:21:23,671 --> 01:21:26,091
practically a friend.

1434
01:21:37,143 --> 01:21:39,354
John Ruth...

1435
01:21:39,479 --> 01:21:41,398
you really think a nigger,

1436
01:21:41,523 --> 01:21:44,776
drummed out of the cavalry with
a yellow stripe down his back,

1437
01:21:44,901 --> 01:21:46,444
was practically friends

1438
01:21:46,569 --> 01:21:48,988
with the president of
the United States of America?

1439
01:21:52,951 --> 01:21:55,620
John Ruth, I hate to be the one
to break it to you,

1440
01:21:55,745 --> 01:21:58,498
but ain't nobody in Minnie's
Haberdashery ever corresponded

1441
01:21:58,623 --> 01:22:00,667
with Abraham Lincoln.

1442
01:22:00,792 --> 01:22:02,460
Least of all,

1443
01:22:02,585 --> 01:22:04,504
that nigger there!

1444
01:22:13,972 --> 01:22:16,224
Was all that horseshit?

1445
01:22:17,809 --> 01:22:20,103
Course it was.

1446
01:22:30,029 --> 01:22:32,699
Good one, Warren!

1447
01:22:32,824 --> 01:22:34,617
Talk that sass, nigger!

1448
01:22:34,742 --> 01:22:37,120
Talk that sass!

1449
01:22:46,880 --> 01:22:50,425
Well, I guess it's true
what they say about you people.

1450
01:22:53,386 --> 01:22:56,681
Can't trust a fuckin' word
comes out of your mouth.

1451
01:22:56,806 --> 01:23:00,351
What's the matter, John Ruth?

1452
01:23:00,477 --> 01:23:02,145
I hurt your feelings?

1453
01:23:02,270 --> 01:23:04,606
As a matter of fact...

1454
01:23:04,731 --> 01:23:06,524
you did.

1455
01:23:09,652 --> 01:23:11,404
I-| know...

1456
01:23:11,529 --> 01:23:14,282
I'm the only black son of a
bitch you ever conversed with,

1457
01:23:14,407 --> 01:23:16,367
so I'm gonna
cut you some slack.

1458
01:23:16,493 --> 01:23:19,245
But you got no idea
what it's like

1459
01:23:19,370 --> 01:23:22,207
being a black man
facin' down America.

1460
01:23:22,332 --> 01:23:24,667
Only time black folks is safe

1461
01:23:24,792 --> 01:23:27,086
is when white folks
is disarmed.

1462
01:23:27,212 --> 01:23:31,216
And this letter
had the desired effect

1463
01:23:31,341 --> 01:23:34,260
of disarmin' white folks.

1464
01:23:35,803 --> 01:23:38,556
Call it what you want.

1465
01:23:38,681 --> 01:23:41,684
I call it
a dirty fuckin' trick.

1466
01:23:50,944 --> 01:23:53,446
You want to know why I lie

1467
01:23:53,571 --> 01:23:55,990
about somethin' like that,
white man?

1468
01:24:00,245 --> 01:24:03,540
Got me on that stagecoach,
didn't it?

1469
01:24:10,547 --> 01:24:12,924
Well, I'll tell you
like the good Lord told John.

1470
01:24:13,049 --> 01:24:15,426
A letter from Abraham Lincoln
wouldn't have had

1471
01:24:15,552 --> 01:24:17,470
that kind of effect on me.

1472
01:24:17,595 --> 01:24:19,514
I might let a whore piss on it.

1473
01:24:19,639 --> 01:24:23,017
- I spit on it.
- Good for you, sister!

1474
01:24:39,784 --> 01:24:41,327
Warren.

1475
01:24:41,452 --> 01:24:43,955
Goddamn it,
you leave that old man alone.

1476
01:24:44,080 --> 01:24:46,040
Stand down, you son of a bitch.

1477
01:24:46,165 --> 01:24:48,751
I shared a battlefield
with this man.

1478
01:24:48,876 --> 01:24:52,130
Or would you
deny me that, too?

1479
01:24:55,174 --> 01:24:58,303
I suppose you were there.

1480
01:24:58,428 --> 01:25:00,179
May I Join you?

1481
01:25:04,851 --> 01:25:07,061
Yes, you may.

1482
01:25:57,320 --> 01:25:58,905
Damn it.

1483
01:26:04,285 --> 01:26:07,747
So, how's life since the war?

1484
01:26:12,794 --> 01:26:15,838
Got both my legs.

1485
01:26:15,963 --> 01:26:19,300
Both my arms.

1486
01:26:19,425 --> 01:26:21,552
I can't complain.

1487
01:26:21,678 --> 01:26:25,181
Got a woman?

1488
01:26:25,306 --> 01:26:27,809
Fever took her
start of this last winter.

1489
01:26:27,934 --> 01:26:29,310
Mm.

1490
01:26:29,435 --> 01:26:31,145
What was her name?

1491
01:26:31,270 --> 01:26:33,648
Betsy.

1492
01:26:33,773 --> 01:26:36,150
Georgia gal?

1493
01:26:36,275 --> 01:26:38,194
Augusta.

1494
01:26:40,029 --> 01:26:42,281
Atlanta boy, Augusta girl.

1495
01:26:44,242 --> 01:26:47,203
I used to raise
Kentucky horses.

1496
01:26:47,328 --> 01:26:49,872
And her pa was the owner
of the breedership

1497
01:26:49,997 --> 01:26:52,083
where I bought
most of my ponies.

1498
01:26:54,335 --> 01:26:57,004
Goddamn it.

1499
01:26:57,130 --> 01:26:59,006
I made a good deal on her.

1500
01:26:59,132 --> 01:27:01,384
Took the stake he gave me

1501
01:27:01,509 --> 01:27:03,928
and bought
a bunch of peach orchards.

1502
01:27:04,053 --> 01:27:06,139
Set myself up pretty well.

1503
01:27:06,264 --> 01:27:08,141
Did a hell of a lot better

1504
01:27:08,266 --> 01:27:11,394
than either one of my no-good
brothers, that's for damn sure.

1505
01:27:11,519 --> 01:27:13,396
Hmm.

1506
01:27:13,521 --> 01:27:15,898
Yeah, your boy come up here
a few years back.

1507
01:27:17,233 --> 01:27:20,737
He spoke highly
of his mama, too.

1508
01:27:20,862 --> 01:27:23,448
You knew my boy?

1509
01:27:23,573 --> 01:27:26,242
Did I know him?

1510
01:27:26,367 --> 01:27:27,869
Yep.

1511
01:27:29,370 --> 01:27:31,247
Yeah, I knew him.

1512
01:27:31,372 --> 01:27:33,833
You did not know my boy.

1513
01:27:37,253 --> 01:27:38,921
Suit yourself.

1514
01:27:42,133 --> 01:27:44,135
Did you know my son?

1515
01:27:44,260 --> 01:27:47,638
I know the day he died.

1516
01:27:47,764 --> 01:27:50,516
- Do you?
- No.

1517
01:27:50,641 --> 01:27:52,685
Do you want to know
what day that was?

1518
01:27:52,810 --> 01:27:54,228
Yes.

1519
01:27:57,565 --> 01:27:59,400
The day...

1520
01:27:59,525 --> 01:28:01,527
he met me.

1521
01:28:17,460 --> 01:28:19,253
He come up here

1522
01:28:19,378 --> 01:28:21,547
to do a little
nigger head-huntin'.

1523
01:28:21,672 --> 01:28:24,300
By then, the reward was, oh...

1524
01:28:24,425 --> 01:28:27,053
$5,000 and braggin' rights.

1525
01:28:27,178 --> 01:28:29,055
But to battle-hard rebs,

1526
01:28:29,180 --> 01:28:31,724
$5,000 just to cut off
a nigger's head?

1527
01:28:33,476 --> 01:28:36,062
That's good money.

1528
01:28:36,187 --> 01:28:39,357
So them Johnnies climbed
this mountain,

1529
01:28:39,482 --> 01:28:41,943
lookin' for fortune.

1530
01:28:42,068 --> 01:28:46,197
There wasn't no fortune
to be found.

1531
01:28:46,322 --> 01:28:48,407
All they found...

1532
01:28:48,533 --> 01:28:50,326
was me.

1533
01:28:52,119 --> 01:28:54,997
All them crackers come up here
sang a different tune

1534
01:28:55,122 --> 01:28:58,459
when they found theyself
at the mercy of a nigger's gun.

1535
01:29:01,671 --> 01:29:03,214
Let's just forget it.

1536
01:29:03,339 --> 01:29:06,509
I'll go my way, you go your'n.

1537
01:29:06,634 --> 01:29:08,636
That's your boy Chester
talkin'.

1538
01:29:08,761 --> 01:29:11,305
You're a goddamn lie!

1539
01:29:11,430 --> 01:29:13,432
"if you just let me go home

1540
01:29:13,558 --> 01:29:15,726
"to my family, I-| swear...

1541
01:29:15,852 --> 01:29:19,564
I'll never set foot
in Wyoming again."

1542
01:29:21,482 --> 01:29:23,609
That's what they all said.

1543
01:29:26,946 --> 01:29:29,240
Beggin' for his life...

1544
01:29:29,365 --> 01:29:31,325
your boy told me

1545
01:29:31,450 --> 01:29:35,204
his whole life story.

1546
01:29:36,956 --> 01:29:38,291
And you...

1547
01:29:38,416 --> 01:29:40,835
was in that story, General.

1548
01:29:40,960 --> 01:29:44,964
And when I knew me I had

1549
01:29:45,089 --> 01:29:46,632
the son...

1550
01:29:46,757 --> 01:29:50,386
of the Bloody Nigger Killer
of Baton Rouge...

1551
01:29:50,511 --> 01:29:53,973
I knew me
I was gonna have some fun.

1552
01:29:54,098 --> 01:29:56,976
You shut your
lyin' nigger lips up!

1553
01:29:57,101 --> 01:29:59,020
General Smithers,
don't you listen to him.

1554
01:29:59,145 --> 01:30:01,147
He didn't know your boy.

1555
01:30:01,272 --> 01:30:04,066
He just heard tell
why you're here, is all.

1556
01:30:04,191 --> 01:30:07,445
It was cold
the day I killed your boy.

1557
01:30:07,570 --> 01:30:09,280
And I don't mean

1558
01:30:09,405 --> 01:30:11,782
snowy-mountain-Wyoming cold,
uh-uh.

1559
01:30:11,908 --> 01:30:14,452
It was colder than that.

1560
01:30:14,577 --> 01:30:17,622
And on that cold day,
with your boy

1561
01:30:17,747 --> 01:30:21,417
at the business end
of my gun barrel,

1562
01:30:21,542 --> 01:30:24,086
I made him strip...

1563
01:30:24,211 --> 01:30:27,214
right down to his bare ass.

1564
01:30:29,592 --> 01:30:32,887
Then I told him
to start walkin'.

1565
01:31:00,957 --> 01:31:03,626
I walked his naked ass
for two hours

1566
01:31:03,751 --> 01:31:06,253
'fore the cold collapsed him.

1567
01:31:07,338 --> 01:31:10,132
You never even knew my boy?

1568
01:31:10,257 --> 01:31:12,551
No, he didn't!

1569
01:31:12,677 --> 01:31:13,928
He's just a sneaky nigger

1570
01:31:14,053 --> 01:31:15,721
trying to get you
to go for that gun.

1571
01:31:15,846 --> 01:31:20,142
Then...
he commenced to beggin' again.

1572
01:31:20,267 --> 01:31:23,938
But this time,
he wasn't beggin' to go home.

1573
01:31:24,063 --> 01:31:27,483
Ah, he knew
he'd never see his home again.

1574
01:31:27,608 --> 01:31:29,860
He wasn't beggin'
for his life, neither,

1575
01:31:29,986 --> 01:31:33,572
'cause he knew
that was long gone.

1576
01:31:33,698 --> 01:31:36,867
All he wanted...

1577
01:31:36,993 --> 01:31:39,161
was a blanket.

1578
01:31:39,286 --> 01:31:42,665
Now, don't judge your boy too
harshly, General.

1579
01:31:42,790 --> 01:31:46,127
You ain't never been cold
as your boy was that day.

1580
01:31:48,295 --> 01:31:50,589
You'd be surprised

1581
01:31:50,715 --> 01:31:53,884
what a man that cold

1582
01:31:54,010 --> 01:31:56,679
would do for a blanket.

1583
01:31:56,804 --> 01:31:59,765
You want to know
what your boy did?

1584
01:32:02,435 --> 01:32:05,521
I pulled my big black pecker

1585
01:32:05,646 --> 01:32:07,982
out of my pants...

1586
01:32:08,107 --> 01:32:10,609
and I made him crawl
through the snow

1587
01:32:10,735 --> 01:32:13,571
on all fours over to it.

1588
01:32:21,245 --> 01:32:23,831
Then I grabbed me a handful

1589
01:32:23,956 --> 01:32:25,332
of that black hair

1590
01:32:25,458 --> 01:32:28,919
at the back of his head...

1591
01:32:29,045 --> 01:32:33,424
and I stuck
my big black johnson

1592
01:32:33,549 --> 01:32:37,720
right down his goddamn throat.

1593
01:32:37,845 --> 01:32:41,432
And it was full of blood,
so it was warm.

1594
01:32:41,557 --> 01:32:45,561
Oh, you bet your sweet ass
it was warm.

1595
01:32:45,686 --> 01:32:49,774
And Chester Charles Smithers

1596
01:32:49,899 --> 01:32:53,569
sucked on that
warm black dingus

1597
01:32:53,694 --> 01:32:55,988
for long as he could!

1598
01:33:07,333 --> 01:33:09,543
You're startin'
to see pictures, ain't ya?

1599
01:33:09,668 --> 01:33:11,545
Your boy...

1600
01:33:11,670 --> 01:33:13,964
black dude's dingus
in his mouth...

1601
01:33:14,090 --> 01:33:17,468
him sh-sh-shakin', him cryin',

1602
01:33:17,593 --> 01:33:19,178
me laughin'...

1603
01:33:23,099 --> 01:33:27,478
...and him not understandin'.

1604
01:33:28,979 --> 01:33:30,606
But you understand,
don't you, Sandy?

1605
01:33:30,731 --> 01:33:34,527
I never did give your boy
that blanket...

1606
01:33:34,652 --> 01:33:37,238
even after all he did,

1607
01:33:37,363 --> 01:33:41,951
and he did everything I asked.

1608
01:33:43,661 --> 01:33:45,704
No blanket.

1609
01:33:45,830 --> 01:33:49,291
That blanket was just a
heart-breakin' liar's promise.

1610
01:33:50,376 --> 01:33:52,002
Kind of like those uniforms

1611
01:33:52,128 --> 01:33:54,171
the Union issued
those colored troops

1612
01:33:54,296 --> 01:33:58,092
that you chose
not to acknowledge.

1613
01:34:03,556 --> 01:34:07,685
So what you gonna do,
old man? Hmm?

1614
01:34:07,810 --> 01:34:11,313
You gonna spend
the next two, three days

1615
01:34:11,438 --> 01:34:14,650
ignorin' the nigger
that killed your boy?

1616
01:34:15,776 --> 01:34:19,405
Ign0rin' how I made him suffer?

1617
01:34:19,530 --> 01:34:23,242
Ignoring how I made him...

1618
01:34:23,367 --> 01:34:26,453
lick... all over my johnson?

1619
01:34:29,165 --> 01:34:33,169
Oh, the dumbest thing
your boy ever did

1620
01:34:33,294 --> 01:34:36,213
was to let me know...

1621
01:34:36,338 --> 01:34:38,757
he was your boy.

1622
01:35:18,881 --> 01:35:20,841
About 15 minutes has past

1623
01:35:20,966 --> 01:35:23,844
since we last left
our characters.

1624
01:35:23,969 --> 01:35:27,890
Joe Gage volunteered to take
Smithers' dead body outside.

1625
01:35:28,015 --> 01:35:31,101
Straws were drawn
to see who'd help him.

1626
01:35:31,227 --> 01:35:33,646
O.B. lost.

1627
01:35:33,771 --> 01:35:36,315
Chris, John Ruth and Oswaldo
had a vigorous debate

1628
01:35:36,440 --> 01:35:38,400
about the legality
of the self-defense murder

1629
01:35:38,525 --> 01:35:40,110
that just transpired.

1630
01:35:40,236 --> 01:35:42,696
Major Marquis Warren,
who was supremely confident

1631
01:35:42,821 --> 01:35:45,115
about the legality
of what just transpired,

1632
01:35:45,241 --> 01:35:47,868
ignored them,
sat at the table by himself

1633
01:35:47,993 --> 01:35:50,120
and drank brandy.

1634
01:35:52,039 --> 01:35:54,541
Captain Chris Mannix donned
the dead general's coat

1635
01:35:54,667 --> 01:35:57,378
and joined Oswaldo in lighting
the candles and lanterns.

1636
01:35:57,503 --> 01:35:59,380
Hey, Ozzie!

1637
01:35:59,505 --> 01:36:01,548
Now, you got the right idea.

1638
01:36:01,674 --> 01:36:03,634
Let's light this place up.

1639
01:36:03,759 --> 01:36:05,886
John Ruth held the door closed,

1640
01:36:06,011 --> 01:36:08,347
waiting for Joe Gage
and O.B. to return.

1641
01:36:13,269 --> 01:36:16,063
Bob enjoyed a Manzana Roja.

1642
01:36:22,569 --> 01:36:25,572
Domergue, however,
hasn't moved from her spot

1643
01:36:25,698 --> 01:36:28,409
at the community dinner table
since John Ruth uncuffed her.

1644
01:36:28,534 --> 01:36:30,786
John Ruth.

1645
01:36:30,911 --> 01:36:33,330
Yeah.

1646
01:36:33,455 --> 01:36:35,833
Can I play that guitar
over there?

1647
01:36:35,958 --> 01:36:38,377
Let's go back a bit.

1648
01:36:38,502 --> 01:36:41,922
Your boy, black dude's dingus
in his mouth.

1649
01:36:42,047 --> 01:36:44,216
15 minutes ago, Major Warren

1650
01:36:44,341 --> 01:36:46,760
shot General Smithers
in front of everybody.

1651
01:36:46,885 --> 01:36:49,388
But about 40 seconds
before that,

1652
01:36:49,513 --> 01:36:51,473
something equally
as important happened,

1653
01:36:51,598 --> 01:36:53,726
but not everybody saw it.

1654
01:36:53,851 --> 01:36:56,186
While Major Warren
was captivating the crowd

1655
01:36:56,312 --> 01:36:59,690
with tales of black dicks
in white mouths,

1656
01:36:59,815 --> 01:37:01,608
somebody...

1657
01:37:01,734 --> 01:37:03,319
poisoned the coffee.

1658
01:37:03,444 --> 01:37:07,323
He did everything I asked.

1659
01:37:07,448 --> 01:37:09,283
No blanket.

1660
01:37:09,408 --> 01:37:12,494
And the only one
to see him do it...

1661
01:37:16,623 --> 01:37:18,834
...was Domergue.

1662
01:37:24,048 --> 01:37:27,051
That's why this chapter
is called

1663
01:37:27,176 --> 01:37:29,136
"D0mergue's Got a Secret."

1664
01:37:32,598 --> 01:37:35,142
John Ruth.

1665
01:37:35,267 --> 01:37:37,019
Yeah.

1666
01:37:37,144 --> 01:37:39,980
Can I play that guitar
over there?

1667
01:37:46,195 --> 01:37:47,863
Yeah.

1668
01:37:53,410 --> 01:37:56,580
You come back with
anything else but a guitar,

1669
01:37:56,705 --> 01:37:59,041
my pistol plays a tune.

1670
01:37:59,166 --> 01:38:01,794
"Domergue's Death March."

1671
01:38:01,919 --> 01:38:03,253
You got it?

1672
01:38:03,379 --> 01:38:05,130

Wha... Hey!

1723

Whoa! Whoa, whoa!

Turn around!

1726
01:42:26,308 --> 01:42:27,809
John,no!

1727
01:42:27,934 --> 01:42:29,436
- No, no, no, no, no!
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

1728
01:42:29,561 --> 01:42:31,897

<i>S'?</i>

1730

Oh, my God!

1735
01:45:33,203 --> 01:45:35,705
Oh! Aah!

1736
01:45:36,998 --> 01:45:38,375
Give me that fucking gun.

1737
01:45:39,626 --> 01:45:41,795
Don't test me, bitch.

1738
01:45:45,090 --> 01:45:46,508
Everybody!

1739
01:45:46,633 --> 01:45:48,218
Get your backsides up

1740
01:45:48,343 --> 01:45:50,220
against that back wall
over yonder.

1741
01:45:50,345 --> 01:45:52,848
Well, goddamn it!

1742
01:45:52,973 --> 01:45:54,850
Get or don't get, Joe Gage.

1743
01:45:54,975 --> 01:45:56,351
It's up to you.

1744
01:45:56,476 --> 01:45:58,645
- I'm gettin'.
- Then get!

1745
01:46:10,991 --> 01:46:12,951
You, too, Senor Bob.

1746
01:46:17,998 --> 01:46:19,457
Everybody turn around

1747
01:46:19,583 --> 01:46:21,543
and put your hands
on that wall.

1748
01:46:25,630 --> 01:46:27,716
Move them damn snowshoes!

1749
01:46:48,904 --> 01:46:50,780
Everybody keep
your mouths shut.

1750
01:46:50,906 --> 01:46:52,490
Do like I say.

1751
01:46:52,616 --> 01:46:54,367
You open your mouth,

1752
01:46:54,492 --> 01:46:56,494
you gonna get a bullet.

1753
01:46:56,620 --> 01:46:57,829
Move a little sudden,

1754
01:46:57,954 --> 01:46:59,331
a little strange,

1755
01:46:59,456 --> 01:47:01,666
you gonna get a bullet.

1756
01:47:01,791 --> 01:47:04,044
Not a warnin', not a question.

1757
01:47:04,169 --> 01:47:05,879
A bullet.

1758
01:47:06,004 --> 01:47:08,340
You got that?

1759
01:47:08,465 --> 01:47:09,883
Let me hear you say,
"I got it!"

1760
01:47:10,008 --> 01:47:11,301
- I got it.
- I got it.

1761
01:47:11,426 --> 01:47:12,510
I got it.

1762
01:47:12,636 --> 01:47:14,304
We have it.

1763
01:47:15,805 --> 01:47:17,807
Chris Mannix,
come over here on this side.

1764
01:47:19,434 --> 01:47:20,810
Come on.

1765
01:47:26,066 --> 01:47:28,026
Take this gun out my holster.

1766
01:47:38,995 --> 01:47:40,830
Point it at them.

1767
01:47:42,248 --> 01:47:44,167
Now, like I said,

1768
01:47:44,292 --> 01:47:47,045
anybody does anything,

1769
01:47:47,170 --> 01:47:49,464
and I mean anything,

1770
01:47:49,589 --> 01:47:51,299
you kill 'em.

1771
01:47:55,095 --> 01:47:56,846
So...

1772
01:47:56,972 --> 01:47:58,848
you finally decided
I'm tellin' the truth

1773
01:47:58,974 --> 01:48:01,017
about bein' the sheriff
of Red Rock, huh?

1774
01:48:02,686 --> 01:48:04,854
I don't know about all that.

1775
01:48:04,980 --> 01:48:07,440
But I know you ain't the killer
poisoned that coffee,

1776
01:48:07,565 --> 01:48:10,068
'cause you almost drunk it
your own damn self.

1777
01:48:10,193 --> 01:48:11,778
One of them is.

1778
01:48:17,075 --> 01:48:18,159
Aah!

1779
01:48:18,284 --> 01:48:20,286
Ow!

1780
01:48:20,412 --> 01:48:23,206
Give me the key.
Give me the key!

1781
01:48:35,176 --> 01:48:38,972
You motherfucking
black bastard!

1782
01:48:39,097 --> 01:48:41,224
You're gonna die
on this mountain,

1783
01:48:41,349 --> 01:48:43,768
and I'm gonna fucking laugh
when you do!

1784
01:48:45,562 --> 01:48:47,188
What'd I say 'bout talkin'?

1785
01:48:47,313 --> 01:48:48,398
Bastard.

1786
01:48:48,523 --> 01:48:50,900
Meant it, didn't I?

1787
01:48:52,068 --> 01:48:53,528
And you need to understand

1788
01:48:53,653 --> 01:48:55,905
you just killed
the only man here

1789
01:48:56,031 --> 01:48:59,159
committed to gettin' you
to Red Rock alive.

1790
01:49:04,956 --> 01:49:07,000
Now, one of y'all...

1791
01:49:07,125 --> 01:49:10,086
is workin' with her.

1792
01:49:10,211 --> 01:49:12,255
Or two of y'all
is workin' with her.

1793
01:49:12,380 --> 01:49:15,008
Or all y'all is.

1794
01:49:17,635 --> 01:49:19,512
But only one of you

1795
01:49:19,637 --> 01:49:21,014
poisoned the coffee.

1796
01:49:24,851 --> 01:49:27,520
Now, what charms this bitch got

1797
01:49:27,645 --> 01:49:30,315
make a man brave a blizzard,

1798
01:49:30,440 --> 01:49:32,275
kill in cold blood?

1799
01:49:34,110 --> 01:49:36,112
I'm sure I don't know.

1800
01:49:39,991 --> 01:49:43,328
But John Ruth's tryin'
to hang your woman.

1801
01:49:43,453 --> 01:49:45,246
So you kill him.

1802
01:49:45,371 --> 01:49:47,165
Okay.

1803
01:49:47,290 --> 01:49:49,292
Maybe.

1804
01:49:49,417 --> 01:49:52,545
But O.B. wasn't hangin' nobody.

1805
01:49:52,670 --> 01:49:54,047
He damn sure wasn't.

1806
01:49:54,172 --> 01:49:55,632
But he sure enough
layin' over there dead

1807
01:49:55,757 --> 01:49:56,883
now, though, ain't he?

1808
01:49:57,008 --> 01:49:59,094
He damn sure is,
you sons of bitches.

1809
01:49:59,219 --> 01:50:01,971
Just like any one of us
would've drunk that coffee.

1810
01:50:02,097 --> 01:50:04,182
Like me, goddamn it.

1811
01:50:04,307 --> 01:50:07,268
Now, those of y'all
with your hands on the wall

1812
01:50:07,393 --> 01:50:08,603
don't practice in poison

1813
01:50:08,728 --> 01:50:10,438
need to think about that.

1814
01:50:12,107 --> 01:50:13,650
Think about how
it could've been you

1815
01:50:13,775 --> 01:50:16,528
rollin' around here
on this floor.

1816
01:50:16,653 --> 01:50:19,072
And how the man standin'
next to you

1817
01:50:19,197 --> 01:50:20,698
would be responsible.

1818
01:50:20,824 --> 01:50:23,284
And I know
who I got my money on.

1819
01:50:23,409 --> 01:50:25,745
Oh, that's right, Joe Gage.

1820
01:50:25,870 --> 01:50:27,247
I'm lookin' at you.

1821
01:50:29,249 --> 01:50:31,626
Not so fast, Chris.

1822
01:50:31,751 --> 01:50:33,920
We'll get there.

1823
01:50:34,045 --> 01:50:37,048
Let's slow it down.

1824
01:50:37,173 --> 01:50:39,592
Let's slow it way down.

1825
01:50:45,140 --> 01:50:46,891
Who made the coffee?

1826
01:50:47,016 --> 01:50:48,601
He did.

1827
01:50:50,645 --> 01:50:52,105
Yeah, he did, didn't he?

1828
01:50:52,230 --> 01:50:55,275
Yeah, he did,
didn't he?

1829
01:50:55,400 --> 01:50:58,611
But it's the stew
that's got me thinkin'.

1830
01:51:00,029 --> 01:51:02,949
Now, how long you said
Minnie been gone?

1831
01:51:03,074 --> 01:51:04,659
A week?

1832
01:51:05,785 --> 01:51:07,245
Si.

1833
01:51:08,329 --> 01:51:09,956
See...

1834
01:51:10,081 --> 01:51:13,042
my mama used to make stew,

1835
01:51:13,168 --> 01:51:15,086
and it always tasted the same,

1836
01:51:15,211 --> 01:51:16,713
no matter the meat.

1837
01:51:16,838 --> 01:51:18,756
And there was another fellow
on the plantation,

1838
01:51:18,882 --> 01:51:20,383
Uncle Charly.

1839
01:51:20,508 --> 01:51:22,051
He made stew, too.

1840
01:51:22,177 --> 01:51:23,845
And like my mama,

1841
01:51:23,970 --> 01:51:27,849
I ate his stew from the time
I was a whipper

1842
01:51:27,974 --> 01:51:30,351
till I was a full-grown man.

1843
01:51:31,561 --> 01:51:33,479
No matter the meat,

1844
01:51:33,605 --> 01:51:36,441
it always tasted
like Uncle Charly's stew.

1845
01:51:37,734 --> 01:51:39,402
Now, I ain't had Minnie's stew

1846
01:51:39,527 --> 01:51:41,362
in six months,
so I ain't no expert.

1847
01:51:41,487 --> 01:51:45,575
But that damn sure is...

1848
01:51:45,700 --> 01:51:48,369
Minnie's stew.

1849
01:51:48,494 --> 01:51:50,830
So if Minnie
is on the north side

1850
01:51:50,955 --> 01:51:53,458
visitin' her mama for a week,

1851
01:51:53,583 --> 01:51:56,419
how'd she make the stew
this mornin'?

1852
01:51:56,544 --> 01:51:58,087
Hmm.

1853
01:52:00,715 --> 01:52:03,593
And this...

1854
01:52:03,718 --> 01:52:07,513
this is Sweet Dave's chair.

1855
01:52:07,639 --> 01:52:09,682
When I sat in it earlier,

1856
01:52:09,807 --> 01:52:11,601
I couldn't believe it.

1857
01:52:11,726 --> 01:52:14,229
Nobody sits
in Sweet Dave's chair.

1858
01:52:14,354 --> 01:52:16,606
Uh, this may be Minnie's place,

1859
01:52:16,731 --> 01:52:19,984
but this is damn sure

1860
01:52:20,109 --> 01:52:22,195
Sweet Dave's chair.

1861
01:52:24,530 --> 01:52:27,700
And if he went
to the north side...

1862
01:52:29,452 --> 01:52:31,663
...I'm pretty goddamn sure

1863
01:52:31,788 --> 01:52:34,499
this chair be goin' with him.

1864
01:52:39,128 --> 01:52:40,964
What's in the chair?

1865
01:52:41,089 --> 01:52:43,258
Just what I thought.

1866
01:52:43,383 --> 01:52:46,344
Sweet Dave's goddamn blood.

1867
01:52:46,469 --> 01:52:48,137
<i>“QM!</i>

1868
01:52:48,263 --> 01:52:49,973
Hoo-hoo-hoo!

1869
01:52:52,100 --> 01:52:56,396
So, are you actually
accusing me of murder?

1870
01:52:59,607 --> 01:53:02,568
Way I see it, Senor Bob,

1871
01:53:02,694 --> 01:53:05,822
is whoever is workin' with her

1872
01:53:05,947 --> 01:53:08,783
ain't who they say they is.

1873
01:53:08,908 --> 01:53:10,743
And if it's you,

1874
01:53:10,868 --> 01:53:12,996
that means Minnie and her man

1875
01:53:13,121 --> 01:53:14,956
ain't at her mama's.

1876
01:53:15,081 --> 01:53:18,543
They layin' out back there
dead somewhere.

1877
01:53:18,668 --> 01:53:20,712
Or if it's you,
little British man,

1878
01:53:20,837 --> 01:53:24,048
the real Oswaldo Mobray layin'
in a ditch somewhere

1879
01:53:24,173 --> 01:53:26,676
and you just a English fella
passin' off his papers.

1880
01:53:26,801 --> 01:53:29,554
Or we go by my theory,

1881
01:53:29,679 --> 01:53:32,598
which is the ugliest guy
did it.

1882
01:53:32,724 --> 01:53:35,268
Which makes it you, Joe Gage.

1883
01:53:35,393 --> 01:53:39,689
So I take it you deduced
the coffee was poisoned

1884
01:53:39,814 --> 01:53:41,774
while you were murdering
the old man?

1885
01:53:42,942 --> 01:53:44,610
Yes.

1886
01:53:44,736 --> 01:53:47,238
Well, mi negro amigo,

1887
01:53:47,363 --> 01:53:49,532
during that whole incident,

1888
01:53:49,657 --> 01:53:52,243
I was sitting on that side
of the room

1889
01:53:52,368 --> 01:53:54,579
playing "Silent Night"
on the piano.

1890
01:53:54,704 --> 01:53:57,707
Oh, I ain't say
you poisoned the coffee.

1891
01:53:57,832 --> 01:54:00,793
I said you didn't make
the stew.

1892
01:54:02,337 --> 01:54:05,798
My theory is...

1893
01:54:05,923 --> 01:54:08,926
you workin' with the man

1894
01:54:09,052 --> 01:54:10,720
who poisoned the coffee,

1895
01:54:10,845 --> 01:54:13,222
and both of y'all
murdered Minnie,

1896
01:54:13,348 --> 01:54:16,267
Sweet Dave and whoever else
picked this bad-luck day

1897
01:54:16,392 --> 01:54:19,228
to visit Minnie's Haberdashery
this mornin'.

1898
01:54:19,354 --> 01:54:23,107
And at some point,
y'all intended

1899
01:54:23,232 --> 01:54:25,735
to bushwhack John Ruth

1900
01:54:25,860 --> 01:54:28,613
and free Daisy.

1901
01:54:28,738 --> 01:54:31,157
But you didn't count
on the blizzard,

1902
01:54:31,282 --> 01:54:34,327
and you didn't count on
the two of us.

1903
01:54:34,452 --> 01:54:35,620
Hmm.

1904
01:54:38,998 --> 01:54:40,958
That's far as I got.
How am I doing?

1905
01:54:44,879 --> 01:54:47,340
You're a real
imaginative nigger,

1906
01:54:47,465 --> 01:54:49,675
ain't you?

1907
01:54:49,801 --> 01:54:52,637
So, do you intend to murder me

1908
01:54:52,762 --> 01:54:55,098
based on a far-fetched
nigger theory,

1909
01:54:55,223 --> 01:54:57,600
or can you prove it, cabron?

1910
01:54:57,725 --> 01:54:59,018
Uaughs)

1911
01:54:59,143 --> 01:55:04,273
It ain't so far-fetched,
Senor Bob.

1912
01:55:04,399 --> 01:55:07,151
And it's a little bit more
than a theory.

1913
01:55:11,531 --> 01:55:14,075
How long you say
you been workin' for Minnie?

1914
01:55:14,200 --> 01:55:15,952
Four months.

1915
01:55:16,077 --> 01:55:17,787
Mmm.

1916
01:55:17,912 --> 01:55:20,581
See, if you'd have been here
two and a half years ago,

1917
01:55:20,706 --> 01:55:24,544
you'd know 'bout that sign
used to hang up over the bar.

1918
01:55:24,669 --> 01:55:27,130
Minnie mention that to you?

1919
01:55:28,423 --> 01:55:30,299
No.

1920
01:55:30,425 --> 01:55:33,219
You want to know what
that sign said, Senor Bob?

1921
01:55:35,346 --> 01:55:39,642
"No dogs or Mexicans allowed."

1922
01:55:43,146 --> 01:55:44,605
Now, Minnie hung that sign up

1923
01:55:44,730 --> 01:55:46,732
the day she opened
this haberdashery.

1924
01:55:46,858 --> 01:55:49,819
And it hung over that bar
every day

1925
01:55:49,944 --> 01:55:52,905
till she took it down
a little over two years ago.

1926
01:55:54,532 --> 01:55:56,284
You know why she took it down?

1927
01:55:58,161 --> 01:56:00,663
She started lettin' in dogs.

1928
01:56:04,375 --> 01:56:08,337
Now, Minnie liked
just about everybody,

1929
01:56:08,463 --> 01:56:10,590
but she sure don't

1930
01:56:10,715 --> 01:56:12,550
like Mexicans.

1931
01:56:12,675 --> 01:56:14,594
So when you tell me

1932
01:56:14,719 --> 01:56:18,264
Minnie went to the north side
to visit her mama,

1933
01:56:18,389 --> 01:56:20,975
well, I find that
highly unlikely.

1934
01:56:21,100 --> 01:56:24,353
But okay, maybe.

1935
01:56:24,479 --> 01:56:27,064
But when you tell me

1936
01:56:27,190 --> 01:56:30,860
Minnie Mink
took the haberdashery,

1937
01:56:30,985 --> 01:56:34,906
the most precious thing to her
in the whole world,

1938
01:56:35,031 --> 01:56:38,993
and left it in the hands
of a goddamn Mexican?

1939
01:56:40,495 --> 01:56:42,121
Well, that's what I meant
in the barn

1940
01:56:42,246 --> 01:56:44,957
when I said that sure
don't sound like Minnie.

1941
01:56:47,043 --> 01:56:50,046
Now I am calling you a liar,

1942
01:56:50,171 --> 01:56:52,131
Senor Bob.

1943
01:56:53,382 --> 01:56:55,384
And if you lyin',

1944
01:56:55,510 --> 01:56:57,011
which you are...

1945
01:56:58,638 --> 01:56:59,597
...then you killed Minnie.

1946
01:56:59,722 --> 01:57:01,641
And Sweet Dave.

1947
01:57:20,076 --> 01:57:22,495
Four measly bullets,

1948
01:57:22,620 --> 01:57:25,706
and there goes Senor Bob.

1949
01:57:27,375 --> 01:57:30,670
But that still
don't get us no closer

1950
01:57:30,795 --> 01:57:34,173
to which one of y'all
poisoned the coffee, though.

1951
01:57:34,298 --> 01:57:35,341
Do it, Chris?

1952
01:57:35,466 --> 01:57:37,426
No, it sure don't.

1953
01:57:43,474 --> 01:57:45,810
Now, one of y'all
poisoned this coffee

1954
01:57:45,935 --> 01:57:47,311
to free Daisy.

1955
01:57:47,436 --> 01:57:49,105
If I don't hear a confession

1956
01:57:49,230 --> 01:57:52,358
from one of you motherfuckers
quick, fast and in a hurry,

1957
01:57:52,483 --> 01:57:55,027
I'm gonna pour
this whole pot of coffee

1958
01:57:55,152 --> 01:57:57,780
down that bitch's
goddamn throat.

1959
01:57:59,073 --> 01:58:02,243
Okay. Time's up.

1960
01:58:02,368 --> 01:58:03,661
Stop!

1961
01:58:03,786 --> 01:58:05,663
All right, I did it.

1962
01:58:05,788 --> 01:58:07,707
It was me.
I poisoned the coffee.

1963
01:58:08,833 --> 01:58:11,794
I fuckin' knew it!

1964
01:58:11,919 --> 01:58:13,379
Oh!

1965
01:58:13,504 --> 01:58:15,881
You gonna die now,
you murderin' bastard!

1966
01:58:16,007 --> 01:58:19,051
Major Warren,
please let me send this ugly

1967
01:58:19,176 --> 01:58:21,053
son of a bitch to hell.

1968
01:58:21,178 --> 01:58:22,972
You killed O.B.

1969
01:58:23,097 --> 01:58:24,682
He was worth ten of you.

1970
01:58:24,807 --> 01:58:26,475
Warren, can I kill him?

1971
01:58:26,601 --> 01:58:27,810
Say adios to your huevos.

1972
01:58:35,318 --> 01:58:38,070
Major Warren!

1973
01:58:55,212 --> 01:58:58,424
I ain't got no gun,

1974
01:58:58,549 --> 01:59:01,010
Sheriff.

1975
01:59:31,415 --> 01:59:33,417
<i>S'?</i>

1976
01:59:35,586 --> 01:59:36,962
Roy!

1977
01:59:37,088 --> 01:59:38,673
Good boy.

1978
01:59:42,551 --> 01:59:44,095
Get up!

1979
01:59:44,220 --> 01:59:45,304
Get up there!

1980
01:59:45,429 --> 01:59:46,555
Get up!

1981
01:59:46,681 --> 01:59:49,308
Packer, Roy, get up!

1982
01:59:49,433 --> 01:59:51,060
Get up!

1983
01:59:51,185 --> 01:59:52,478
Get up there! Get up!

1984
01:59:52,603 --> 01:59:53,729
Get up!

1985
01:59:53,854 --> 01:59:55,064
Get up there!
Get up!

1986
01:59:55,189 --> 01:59:56,774
Get up!

1987
01:59:56,899 --> 01:59:58,067
Go!

1988
02:00:00,444 --> 02:00:03,864
Go! Go! Go!

1989
02:00:03,989 --> 02:00:06,325
Go! Go!

1990
02:00:08,452 --> 02:00:09,787
Go!

1991
02:01:10,848 --> 02:01:12,391
Get up. Get up.

1992
02:01:12,516 --> 02:01:14,643
- Hyah! Get up!
Get up! -Get up!

1993
02:01:14,769 --> 02:01:15,811
Get up!

1994
02:01:15,936 --> 02:01:17,521
Get up!

1995
02:01:26,197 --> 02:01:27,448
Get up!

1996
02:01:27,573 --> 02:01:29,950
Get up!

1997
02:01:33,621 --> 02:01:35,206
Get up! Get up!

1998
02:01:51,472 --> 02:01:52,765
- Whoa!
- Easy.

1999
02:01:52,890 --> 02:01:54,016
- Whoa.
- Whoa!

2000
02:01:54,141 --> 02:01:56,060
Whoa. Hey, Charly, my boy.

2001
02:01:56,185 --> 02:01:57,228
How the hell are you?

2002
02:01:57,353 --> 02:01:58,771
Hiya, Ed. Hiya, Judy.

2003
02:01:58,896 --> 02:02:00,272
Yeah!

2004
02:02:01,524 --> 02:02:02,483
Ah.

2005
02:02:02,608 --> 02:02:03,776
How many you got?

2006
02:02:03,901 --> 02:02:04,902
Full house today, friend.

2007
02:02:05,027 --> 02:02:06,529
Got one in there waitin'.

2008
02:02:06,654 --> 02:02:07,988
Well, he's gonna have
to keep on waitin'.

2009
02:02:08,113 --> 02:02:09,114
We ain't got no room.

2010
02:02:09,240 --> 02:02:10,574
Well, you need to tell Minnie.

2011
02:02:10,699 --> 02:02:11,951
'Cause he been here two days,

2012
02:02:12,076 --> 02:02:13,619
and Minnie wants him
out of here.

2013
02:02:13,744 --> 02:02:15,621
Well, I can't give him
a seat I don't have.

2014
02:02:15,746 --> 02:02:18,249
Listen, why don't you take
the passengers inside

2015
02:02:18,374 --> 02:02:19,708
and introduce 'em to Minnie,

2016
02:02:19,834 --> 02:02:21,210
warm yourself up
and drink some coffee.

2017
02:02:21,335 --> 02:02:22,419
Yeah.

2018
02:02:27,675 --> 02:02:29,385
Here we are, everybody.

2019
02:02:29,510 --> 02:02:30,845
Minnie's Haberdashery.

2020
02:02:30,970 --> 02:02:32,137
Step outside,
you and your friends

2021
02:02:32,263 --> 02:02:33,472
can stretch your legs.

2022
02:02:33,597 --> 02:02:34,932
When you're ready,
step on inside,

2023
02:02:35,057 --> 02:02:37,226
get warm by the fire,
get some coffee in you.

2024
02:02:37,351 --> 02:02:39,144
I'll introduce you to Minnie.

2025
02:02:42,356 --> 02:02:45,025
Hiya, Minnie!

2026
02:02:45,150 --> 02:02:47,111
<i>S'?</i>

2027
02:03:02,751 --> 02:03:04,503
Now, Minnie,
I'm not tryin' to tell you

2028
02:03:04,628 --> 02:03:06,547
how to run your business,
but I would think coffee

2029
02:03:06,672 --> 02:03:08,924
-would be the first thing
you'd make. -Hmm.

2030
02:03:09,049 --> 02:03:10,384
Come on in, everybody.
Don't be shy.

2031
02:03:10,509 --> 02:03:11,969
Hats!

2032
02:03:12,094 --> 02:03:14,430
Everybody, this is Minnie,
and this is her place.

2033
02:03:14,555 --> 02:03:17,766
Behind me, pluckin'
that chicken, is Gemma.

2034
02:03:17,892 --> 02:03:18,934
Ah.

2035
02:03:19,059 --> 02:03:21,395
Lovely smile, that Gemma.

2036
02:03:21,520 --> 02:03:23,272
Now, the fella in the uniform
I don't know,

2037
02:03:23,397 --> 02:03:25,399
but the one he's playing chess
with is Sweet Dave.

2038
02:03:25,524 --> 02:03:26,692
Hiya, Dave.

2039
02:03:26,817 --> 02:03:28,777
Hey, Judy.

2040
02:03:28,903 --> 02:03:30,446
And, Minnie,

2041
02:03:30,571 --> 02:03:31,989
these are the passengers.

2042
02:03:32,114 --> 02:03:33,991
Well, that's not good enough.

2043
02:03:34,116 --> 02:03:35,951
Go on, take away them rags,

2044
02:03:36,076 --> 02:03:38,329
let's see some faces,
let's hear some names.

2045
02:03:38,454 --> 02:03:41,040
Oswaldo Mobray, madam.

2046
02:03:41,165 --> 02:03:42,458
Joe Gage.

2047
02:03:42,583 --> 02:03:44,668
Bob.

2048
02:03:44,793 --> 02:03:46,420
And I'm Jody.

2049
02:03:46,545 --> 02:03:49,173
It's a pleasant surprise
to find such a warm sanctuary

2050
02:03:49,298 --> 02:03:51,467
in the middle
of such a cold hell.

2051
02:03:51,592 --> 02:03:53,135
Well, make yourself
comfortable.

2052
02:03:53,260 --> 02:03:54,511
Get warm by the fire.

2053
02:03:54,637 --> 02:03:56,680
Uh, we're just gonna go
warm ourselves

2054
02:03:56,805 --> 02:03:58,432
by the stove,
if that's all right.

2055
02:03:58,557 --> 02:04:00,309
Oh, stove, fireplace, whatever.

2056
02:04:00,434 --> 02:04:01,435
Just get warm.

2057
02:04:01,560 --> 02:04:02,811
Oh, and Judy said somethin'

2058
02:04:02,937 --> 02:04:04,688
about the best coffee
in the world.

2059
02:04:04,813 --> 02:04:06,815
Ah, yes. I do believe Judy
did say something

2060
02:04:06,941 --> 02:04:09,234
about the best coffee
in the world.

2061
02:04:09,360 --> 02:04:10,694
Well, I don't know
about all that,

2062
02:04:10,819 --> 02:04:12,363
but I tell you what it is.

2063
02:04:12,488 --> 02:04:13,989
It's hot, it's strong,
and it's good.

2064
02:04:14,114 --> 02:04:15,324
And in this here snow,

2065
02:04:15,449 --> 02:04:17,076
it sure enough warms
your ass up.

2066
02:04:17,201 --> 02:04:19,536
You don't need to sell it,
Minnie, you need to make it.

2067
02:04:19,662 --> 02:04:21,205
And you need to get
your ass out there

2068
02:04:21,330 --> 02:04:23,415
and help Charly with them bags
and get Ed in here.

2069
02:04:23,540 --> 02:04:25,250
Yes, ma'am.

2070
02:04:25,376 --> 02:04:27,378
- But fix that coffee.
<i>- I'll</i> fix you!

2071
02:04:29,838 --> 02:04:31,465
I don't know, some old man.

2072
02:04:31,590 --> 02:04:33,717
Well, I don't know what
I'm supposed to do about it.

2073
02:04:33,842 --> 02:04:35,761
I'm just telling you
what she said.

2074
02:04:35,886 --> 02:04:37,680
Anyway, she sent me out here
to help Charly.

2075
02:04:37,805 --> 02:04:40,265
She wants to talk to you.

2076
02:04:40,391 --> 02:04:42,059
Charly, you got a hold
of these fellas?

2077
02:04:42,184 --> 02:04:43,727
Got 'em, Ed.

2078
02:05:00,202 --> 02:05:03,372
Miss Minnie,
would you roll me a cigarette?

2079
02:05:03,497 --> 02:05:04,873
Sure, honey.

2080
02:05:04,999 --> 02:05:06,375
I smoke Red Apple tobacco.

2081
02:05:06,500 --> 02:05:07,418
That all right?

2082
02:05:07,543 --> 02:05:09,503
That's my favorite.

2083
02:05:12,506 --> 02:05:15,300
Don't mind me, gentlemen.

2084
02:05:15,426 --> 02:05:17,886
I'm just watching.

2085
02:05:18,012 --> 02:05:20,681
You DEW?

2086
02:05:20,806 --> 02:05:24,935
You know, I must have had
at least 12 people

2087
02:05:25,060 --> 02:05:27,396
teach me that goddamn game.

2088
02:05:27,521 --> 02:05:30,899
Just never could keep
the moves in my head.

2089
02:05:32,317 --> 02:05:33,944
But if I'm not disturbing,

2090
02:05:34,069 --> 02:05:35,237
I'd like to watch.

2091
02:05:35,362 --> 02:05:36,780
Hell no. I like whippin'

2092
02:05:36,905 --> 02:05:38,657
this old man's ass
in front of a audience.

2093
02:05:38,782 --> 02:05:41,160
You ain't whippin' shit!

2094
02:05:42,870 --> 02:05:45,414
Merci beaucoup,
Mademoiselle Minnie.

2095
02:05:45,539 --> 02:05:46,957
Oh, that's real nice.

2096
02:05:47,082 --> 02:05:48,500
What is that?

2097
02:05:48,625 --> 02:05:49,793
That's French.

2098
02:05:49,918 --> 02:05:51,587
You speak French?

2099
02:05:51,712 --> 02:05:53,088
Oui.

2100
02:05:53,213 --> 02:05:55,424
"Oui"? What does that mean?

2101
02:05:55,549 --> 02:05:57,301
It means "yes."

2102
02:05:57,426 --> 02:05:59,678
Oui, yes.

2103
02:05:59,803 --> 02:06:03,265
Hey, hey, Dave,
ask me if my ass is fat.

2104
02:06:03,390 --> 02:06:04,433
What?

2105
02:06:04,558 --> 02:06:06,143
Ask me if my ass is fat.

2106
02:06:06,268 --> 02:06:07,561
It is.

2107
02:06:07,686 --> 02:06:09,313
I said ask me.

2108
02:06:09,438 --> 02:06:10,647
Why?

2109
02:06:10,773 --> 02:06:12,524
Just do it!

2110
02:06:12,649 --> 02:06:14,485
Is your ass fat?

2111
02:06:14,610 --> 02:06:16,028
Oui.

2112
02:06:16,153 --> 02:06:18,280
Look at that, y'all,
I can speak French.

2113
02:06:20,699 --> 02:06:23,535
<i>S'?</i>

2114
02:06:56,110 --> 02:06:57,986
Are you the, uh,

2115
02:06:58,112 --> 02:06:59,530
jelly bean salesman
around here?

2116
02:07:01,198 --> 02:07:03,492
How many peppermint sticks
I get for a nickel?

2117
02:07:03,617 --> 02:07:05,619
Five.

2118
02:07:05,744 --> 02:07:07,704
All right.

2119
02:07:10,124 --> 02:07:12,334
- Here you go.
- Thank you, sugar.

2120

GEMMA 3
Okay.

2121
02:07:21,677 --> 02:07:24,805
Uh, allow me

02:07:45,159 --> 02:07:46,785
I'm bringing in your bags

2124
02:07:46,910 --> 02:07:49,288
in case anybody wants to change
your clothes before Red Rock.

2125
02:07:49,413 --> 02:07:50,914
Oh.

2126
02:07:59,381 --> 02:08:02,217
Peppermint stick?

2127
02:08:06,513 --> 02:08:08,557
Thanks.

2128
02:08:11,685 --> 02:08:14,354
So why do they call you
"Six-Horse Judy" anyway?

2129
02:08:16,064 --> 02:08:17,733
'Cause I'm the only Judy
you've ever seen

2130
02:08:17,858 --> 02:08:20,277
that can drive
a six-horse team.

2131
02:08:20,402 --> 02:08:21,612
Oh, yeah.

2132
02:08:23,113 --> 02:08:25,407
Kind of a stupid question.

2133
02:08:27,409 --> 02:08:29,077
Do you mind
holding this for me?

2134
02:08:29,203 --> 02:08:30,913
Ah...

2135
02:08:31,038 --> 02:08:33,749
rock steady, madam.

2136
02:08:33,874 --> 02:08:36,501
Rock steady.

2137
02:08:36,627 --> 02:08:40,714
You got a very sweet
little accent.

2138
02:08:40,839 --> 02:08:42,758
Where's that from, England?

2139
02:08:42,883 --> 02:08:44,426
I take exception to that.

2140
02:08:46,136 --> 02:08:48,597
- New Zealand.
- Careful, madam. Precarious.

2141
02:08:48,722 --> 02:08:50,265
Is that anywhere near,
uh, Old Zealand?

2142
02:08:52,935 --> 02:08:54,895
<i>S'?</i>

2143
02:09:10,869 --> 02:09:12,204
Mmm.

2144
02:09:13,247 --> 02:09:14,623
Auckland?

2145
02:09:14,748 --> 02:09:16,541
What the fuck's an Auckland?

2146
02:09:16,667 --> 02:09:18,252
It's where I'm from.

2147
02:09:18,377 --> 02:09:19,920
It's our biggest city.

2148
02:09:20,045 --> 02:09:21,505
- Coffee!
- Mm-hmm.

2149
02:09:22,756 --> 02:09:24,132
Coffee's ready.

2150
02:09:24,258 --> 02:09:26,051
Well, it's about damn time!

2151
02:09:28,095 --> 02:09:29,930
Best coffee on the mountain.

2152
02:09:30,055 --> 02:09:32,224
Oh, I don't know
about all that.

2153
02:09:32,349 --> 02:09:35,644
Stagecoach drivers like it,
passengers not so much.

2154
02:09:35,769 --> 02:09:38,063
Most find it a mite too strong.

2155
02:09:38,188 --> 02:09:40,065
Can't be too strong
on this mountain.

2156
02:09:40,190 --> 02:09:41,358
Thank you.

2157
02:09:46,655 --> 02:09:48,073
Well?

02:09:48,198 --> 02:09:49,741
What do you think?

2159
02:10:12,514 --> 02:10:13,598
Shit, fuck!

02:10:16,101 --> 02:10:17,602
Shit!

2161
02:10:39,499 --> 02:10:40,709
Yep.

- Mmm, si.
- He adds something.

Not much, but something.

he does make the setup
more convincing.

I'll talk to the old man.

- You three collect the bodies

2172
02:11:14,034 --> 02:11:15,827
and chuck 'em
in that well out there.

2173
02:11:17,371 --> 02:11:19,164
And then start
unhitchin' the horses

2174
02:11:19,289 --> 02:11:21,083
and gettin' 'em in the barn
and gettin' 'em fed.

2175
02:11:21,208 --> 02:11:23,168
Well, hang on. I mean,
puttin' the horses away,

2176
02:11:23,293 --> 02:11:24,961
that's easy enough,

2177
02:11:25,087 --> 02:11:27,005
but draggin' these fat bastards
up and down the mountain,

that's fuckin'
impossible, mate.

Okay.

2180
02:11:29,966 --> 02:11:32,302
Well, this is a store,
so there's gotta be

2181
02:11:32,427 --> 02:11:33,970
a wheelbarrow
around here somewhere.

2182

with this old hickory tree,

was a cat,

that we buildin' out back,

dirty...

son of a gun

is gonna come in here...

2228
02:14:24,975 --> 02:14:27,852
...and he's gonna have
my sister with him.

2229
02:14:27,978 --> 02:14:31,523
And he is gonna
have her in chains.

2230
02:14:34,568 --> 02:14:37,696
He's taking her to Red Rock
to be hung.

2231
02:14:47,831 --> 02:14:50,083
Do you know why?

2232
02:14:50,208 --> 02:14:52,544
No.

2233
02:14:55,589 --> 02:14:57,716
$10,000.

2234
02:14:59,801 --> 02:15:02,971
That's why.

2235
02:15:03,096 --> 02:15:05,015
Now, when he gets here,

2236
02:15:05,140 --> 02:15:09,477
I'm gonna kill that fella
and turn my sister loose.

2237
02:15:09,603 --> 02:15:13,481
Now, do you have any reason
why you would want to interfere

2238
02:15:13,607 --> 02:15:16,568
with me saving my sister
from a hangman's rope?

2239
02:15:16,693 --> 02:15:17,736
No.

2240
02:15:17,861 --> 02:15:18,987
You don't?

2241
02:15:19,112 --> 02:15:20,280
No, I don't.

2242
02:15:20,405 --> 02:15:21,865
You sure you don't?

2243
02:15:21,990 --> 02:15:25,076
I mean, we did just kill
Minnie and Sweet Dave.

2244
02:15:26,202 --> 02:15:27,621
Now, you and Sweet Dave looked

2245
02:15:27,746 --> 02:15:28,997
mighty chummy over here.

2246
02:15:29,122 --> 02:15:30,290
I just met these people!

2247
02:15:30,415 --> 02:15:32,000
I don't give a damn about them!

2248
02:15:32,125 --> 02:15:34,377
Or you. Or your sister.

2249
02:15:34,502 --> 02:15:37,756
Or any other son of a bitch
in Wyoming, for that matter.

2250
02:15:37,881 --> 02:15:41,301
That is a good answer,

2251
02:15:41,426 --> 02:15:43,887
old man.

2252
02:15:44,012 --> 02:15:46,181
Now, when they get here,

2253
02:15:46,306 --> 02:15:49,309
you just sit your ass
in this chair,

2254
02:15:49,434 --> 02:15:51,603
and you don't do nothin'.

2255
02:15:51,728 --> 02:15:52,937
You don't say nothin'.

2256
02:15:53,063 --> 02:15:54,147
"Hello."

2257
02:15:54,272 --> 02:15:55,190
"Thank you."

2258
02:15:55,315 --> 02:15:56,316
"Good night."

2259
02:15:56,441 --> 02:15:57,651
That's about it.

2260
02:15:57,776 --> 02:16:00,695
Maybe your name.

2261
02:16:00,820 --> 02:16:01,905
But that's it.

2262
02:16:02,030 --> 02:16:03,531
"Hello."

2263
02:16:03,657 --> 02:16:04,658
"Thank you."

2264
02:16:04,783 --> 02:16:06,618
"Good night."

2265
02:16:06,743 --> 02:16:09,120
- And maybe my name.
- Maybe your name.

2266
02:16:09,245 --> 02:16:12,290
Mm-hmm, be a, be a old man.

2267
02:16:12,415 --> 02:16:13,792
Be dotty.

2268
02:16:13,917 --> 02:16:16,086
Go to sleep.

2269
02:16:16,211 --> 02:16:18,838
And don't you say nothin',

2270
02:16:18,963 --> 02:16:21,049
and I mean nothin',

2271
02:16:21,174 --> 02:16:23,051
to that bounty hunter
that's got my sister.

2272
02:16:23,176 --> 02:16:24,803
Do you understand?

2273
02:16:24,928 --> 02:16:26,137
Yes.

2274
02:16:28,306 --> 02:16:31,351
When it's safe, I'll kill him,

2275
02:16:31,476 --> 02:16:32,936
free my sister

2276
02:16:33,061 --> 02:16:35,438
and leave you be.

2277
02:16:37,857 --> 02:16:39,818
Deal?

2278
02:16:43,697 --> 02:16:45,448
Deal.

2279
02:16:45,573 --> 02:16:47,158
Thank you.

2280
02:16:48,576 --> 02:16:50,161
During the next four hours,

2281
02:16:50,286 --> 02:16:52,414
Jody and the boys chucked
the bodies down the well...

2282
02:16:55,834 --> 02:16:57,836
...put away the horses...

2283
02:17:00,213 --> 02:17:01,923
...tidied up around Minnie's...

2284
02:17:04,217 --> 02:17:06,261
...stashed weapons
for further use...

2285
02:17:10,640 --> 02:17:14,185
...and waited for John Ruth
and Daisy's stage to arrive.

2286
02:17:16,646 --> 02:17:18,189
All right, boys.

2287
02:17:18,314 --> 02:17:19,858
This is it.

2288
02:17:19,983 --> 02:17:21,693
Let's get ready.

2289
02:17:27,407 --> 02:17:29,242
Now, remember,

2290
02:17:29,367 --> 02:17:31,911
it doesn't matter
if we have four men or 40,

2291
02:17:32,036 --> 02:17:33,788
we are still
gonna be facing John Ruth

2292
02:17:33,913 --> 02:17:35,123
chained to my sister

2293
02:17:35,248 --> 02:17:36,791
with a pistol pointed
at her belly.

2294
02:17:36,916 --> 02:17:38,543
Now, killin' that fella

2295
02:17:38,668 --> 02:17:40,795
'fore he kills my sister
ain't gonna be easy,

2296
02:17:40,920 --> 02:17:43,673
but you better believe that's
exactly what we gonna do.

2297
02:17:43,798 --> 02:17:47,010
So the name of the game here
is patience.

2298
02:17:47,135 --> 02:17:49,512
Trapped here
for two or three days,

2299
02:17:49,637 --> 02:17:52,348
at some point
he will close his eyes.

2300
02:17:52,474 --> 02:17:55,143
And that's when you blow
the top of his head off.

2301
02:17:55,268 --> 02:17:57,061
Remember, old man.

2302
02:17:57,187 --> 02:17:59,856
If my sister don't make it
off of this mountain alive,

2303
02:17:59,981 --> 02:18:01,149
neither do you.

2304
02:18:01,274 --> 02:18:02,817
I'll do my best.

2305
02:18:10,366 --> 02:18:13,787
Whoa, whoa, easy.

2306
02:18:13,912 --> 02:18:16,998
Whoa. Whoa.

2307
02:18:19,667 --> 02:18:21,002
Good luck, mate.

2308
02:18:33,473 --> 02:18:35,600
What the hell is going on?

2309
02:18:35,725 --> 02:18:37,852
We weren't expecting
another stage tonight!

2310
02:18:37,977 --> 02:18:39,604
- Yeah, I can see you
- PETE: Here.

2311
02:18:39,729 --> 02:18:41,022
Already got another one
up in here.

2312
02:18:41,147 --> 02:18:42,607
No.

2313
02:18:42,732 --> 02:18:45,026
Just got through
puttin' the horses away!

2314
02:18:45,151 --> 02:18:47,570
Well, this ain't
the normal line.

2315
02:18:47,695 --> 02:18:49,781
But we are stuck on
the wrong side of a blizzard,

2316
02:18:49,906 --> 02:18:51,324
so it looks like
you're stuck with us.

2317
02:18:51,449 --> 02:18:52,617
Now you gotta do another one.

2318
02:18:52,742 --> 02:18:55,119
Are Minnie
and Sweet Dave inside?

2319
02:18:55,245 --> 02:18:56,746
They ain't here!

2320
02:18:56,871 --> 02:18:59,874
I'm running the place
while they're gone.

2321
02:18:59,999 --> 02:19:02,210
Where's Minnie and Sweet Dave?

2322
02:19:02,335 --> 02:19:04,879
He says they ain't here.

2323
02:19:05,004 --> 02:19:07,298
He's looking after the place
while they're gone.

2324
02:19:07,423 --> 02:19:09,175
Who are you?

2325
02:19:11,010 --> 02:19:14,305
I'm Bob.

2326
02:19:14,430 --> 02:19:18,935
Well, whoever you are,
help O.B. with the horses.

2327
02:19:21,020 --> 02:19:23,898
Get 'em out of this cold
'fore that blizzard hits us.

2328
02:19:24,023 --> 02:19:26,276
Whoa. You all right?

2329
02:19:26,401 --> 02:19:27,819
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

2330
02:19:27,944 --> 02:19:29,571
Esperate, esperate, esperate!

2331
02:19:29,696 --> 02:19:32,532
I just put
those other horses away.

2332
02:19:32,657 --> 02:19:35,159
You need it done fast,
you need to help.

2333
02:19:35,285 --> 02:19:37,662
I got two of my best men on it.

2334
02:19:39,205 --> 02:19:40,957
You heard him, freeloaders.

2335
02:19:41,082 --> 02:19:42,750
Get to work.

2336
02:19:42,876 --> 02:19:46,129
All right, you two,
unhook the leaders.

2337
02:19:46,254 --> 02:19:49,007
Come on, let's go!

2338
02:19:49,132 --> 02:19:50,550
Open up!

2339
02:19:50,675 --> 02:19:52,260
- You have to kick it open!
- Ya gotta kick it open!

2340
02:19:52,385 --> 02:19:54,095
- What?
- Kick it open!

2341
02:20:26,586 --> 02:20:28,504
How you doin', old boy?

2342
02:20:29,839 --> 02:20:31,925
They shot my nuts off.

2343
02:20:32,050 --> 02:20:34,969
I'm freezin',
burnin' up the same time.

2344
02:20:35,094 --> 02:20:37,847
Bleedin' like a stuck pig.

2345
02:20:37,972 --> 02:20:40,558
I think I'm gonna die.

2346
02:20:40,683 --> 02:20:42,644
And these motherfuckers did it.

2347
02:20:45,104 --> 02:20:46,940
That's how I'm doin'.

2348
02:20:47,065 --> 02:20:48,650
How you doin'?

2349
02:20:49,817 --> 02:20:53,029
Well, my leg hurts really bad.

2350
02:20:53,154 --> 02:20:56,366
But I think, if I put all
my weight on my right foot...

2351
02:20:56,491 --> 02:20:57,909
I was just bein' sarcastic.

2352
02:20:58,034 --> 02:20:59,911
I don't give a fuck
about your leg.

2353
02:21:00,036 --> 02:21:01,245
Huh.

2354
02:21:01,371 --> 02:21:03,748
Now, you just...

2355
02:21:03,873 --> 02:21:05,959
make yourself comfortable.

2356
02:21:06,084 --> 02:21:08,211
Don't worry about my comfort.

2357
02:21:08,336 --> 02:21:11,923
Shit, I can't feel
my ass no more.

2358
02:21:12,048 --> 02:21:14,842
Worry about these owl hoots

2359
02:21:14,968 --> 02:21:20,473
and that bushwhackin'
nut shooter in the basement.

2360
02:21:20,598 --> 02:21:22,767
All right!

2361
02:21:22,892 --> 02:21:27,855
You... fella in the basement!

2362
02:21:27,981 --> 02:21:33,486
You either give up
by the time I count to three...

2363
02:21:33,611 --> 02:21:36,781
or I shoot Domergue
in the head.

2364
02:21:36,906 --> 02:21:39,200
One!

2365
02:21:39,325 --> 02:21:40,910
Two!

2366
02:21:41,035 --> 02:21:44,455
No, no, no, no,
don't shoot her in the head!

2367
02:21:44,580 --> 02:21:45,999
I'm coming up.

2368
02:21:46,124 --> 02:21:49,752
Hold on now,
you bushwhackin' sack shooter!

2369
02:21:49,877 --> 02:21:51,421
You just open the door.

2370
02:21:51,546 --> 02:21:53,464
We tell you when to come up.

2371
02:21:57,927 --> 02:22:00,888
Now throw out your pistol.

2372
02:22:01,014 --> 02:22:02,974
Toward the bed.

2373
02:22:05,393 --> 02:22:08,563
Bet he got another.

2374
02:22:08,688 --> 02:22:11,315
Now throw out
your other pistol.

2375
02:22:11,441 --> 02:22:12,942
I ain't got another pistol!

2376
02:22:13,067 --> 02:22:15,153
Well, you better shit
another pistol out your ass,

2377
02:22:15,278 --> 02:22:16,904
'cause if you don't
throw one up here

2378
02:22:17,030 --> 02:22:20,116
in the next two seconds,
we gonna kill this bitch.

2379
02:22:23,077 --> 02:22:24,579
See?

2380
02:22:24,704 --> 02:22:26,831
Told you.

2381
02:22:26,956 --> 02:22:31,544
Now, with your hands
where we can see 'em,

2382
02:22:31,669 --> 02:22:36,132
slowly come on up.

2383
02:23:07,830 --> 02:23:10,249
How you doing, dummy?

2384
02:23:10,374 --> 02:23:15,046
Better,
now I see your ugly face.

2385
02:23:17,673 --> 02:23:18,716
<i>(gunman</i>

2386
02:23:21,677 --> 02:23:23,137
How you like that?!

2387
02:23:23,262 --> 02:23:25,056
You bushwhackin' castrator!

2388
02:23:25,181 --> 02:23:27,391
What are you doing?!
He was giving up!

2389
02:23:27,517 --> 02:23:29,894
It took him too long,
so I done it for him.

2390
02:23:33,022 --> 02:23:37,318
Joe Gage, get your ass over
here and shut this trap door.

2391
02:23:57,296 --> 02:23:59,298
I'm sorry, honey.

2392
02:24:07,431 --> 02:24:09,308
May I sit in a chair?

2393
02:24:09,433 --> 02:24:12,103
Yes, you may-

2394
02:24:21,320 --> 02:24:23,781
Keep your hands
flat on that table.

2395
02:24:23,906 --> 02:24:25,867
And don't move 'em.

2396
02:24:25,992 --> 02:24:28,202
Mannix!

2397
02:24:28,327 --> 02:24:31,873
You sure picked the wrong time
to turn into a nigger lover.

2398
02:24:31,998 --> 02:24:33,541
Don't you see,
that nigger and John Ruth

2399
02:24:33,666 --> 02:24:35,543
put you smack dab
in the middle of danger?

2400
02:24:35,668 --> 02:24:36,961
You're about to be murdered

2401
02:24:37,086 --> 02:24:38,296
in some nigger
named Minnie's house,

2402
02:24:38,421 --> 02:24:40,298
and you don't even know why!

2403
02:24:40,423 --> 02:24:44,135
Okay... bitch.

2404
02:24:44,260 --> 02:24:46,429
I'll bite.

2405
02:24:46,554 --> 02:24:47,889
Why?

2406
02:24:48,014 --> 02:24:50,641
I'm working with
all three of them fellas.

2407
02:24:50,766 --> 02:24:52,727
But not 'cause they got
butterflies in their belly

2408
02:24:52,852 --> 02:24:55,605
about me, but because
we're all gang members.

2409
02:24:55,730 --> 02:24:57,982
The Jody Domingre Gang.

2410
02:24:58,107 --> 02:25:01,652
That fella y'all just killed
in the basement

2411
02:25:01,777 --> 02:25:03,237
was Jody Domingre!

2412
02:25:03,362 --> 02:25:05,448
My brother!

2413
02:25:05,573 --> 02:25:09,911
Well, who the hell
is Jody Domingre?

2414
02:25:10,036 --> 02:25:12,163
You want to tell him,
bounty man?

2415
02:25:13,581 --> 02:25:17,460
He was a big bad cat
worth $50,000.

2416
02:25:17,585 --> 02:25:21,589
And every member of his gang
was worth at least ten.

2417
02:25:21,714 --> 02:25:24,634
Which finally explains
why you worth ten.

2418
02:25:24,759 --> 02:25:27,094
And what's gonna happen when
that sun comes out, nigger?

2419
02:25:27,220 --> 02:25:29,931
So is my brother's 15 men
coming straight here for us.

2420
02:25:30,056 --> 02:25:31,933
Tell him, Grouch!

2421
02:25:32,058 --> 02:25:34,352
Jody got 15 men
waiting in Red Rock.

2422
02:25:36,020 --> 02:25:39,315
We couldn't kill John Ruth
and free Daisy here,

2423
02:25:39,440 --> 02:25:43,945
their job was to sack the town,
kill John Ruth

2424
02:25:44,070 --> 02:25:46,656
and free Daisy there.

2425
02:25:46,781 --> 02:25:50,284
Now, with my brother dead,
I'm in charge of this gang.

2426
02:25:50,409 --> 02:25:51,744
- Right, boys?
- That's right, Daisy.

2427
02:25:51,869 --> 02:25:52,787
Oh, yeah.

2428
02:25:52,912 --> 02:25:54,705
And, Chris, I am telling you,

2429
02:25:54,830 --> 02:25:59,168
you ain't done anything yet
that we can't forgive.

2430
02:25:59,293 --> 02:26:01,128
So, let's make a deal.

2431
02:26:01,254 --> 02:26:02,713
No deals, bitch.

2432
02:26:02,838 --> 02:26:05,299
You gonna let that nigger
speak for you, Chris?!

2433
02:26:05,424 --> 02:26:09,136
Hold it, Warren.

2434
02:26:09,262 --> 02:26:12,223
Seeing as how she ain't got
nothing to sell,

2435
02:26:12,348 --> 02:26:16,352
I'm kinda curious
about her sales pitch.

2436
02:26:16,477 --> 02:26:17,687
Humor me.

2437
02:26:18,813 --> 02:26:22,650
All right... bitch.

2438
02:26:31,200 --> 02:26:35,955
What's... your... deal?

2439
02:26:36,080 --> 02:26:38,082
Easy.

2440
02:26:38,207 --> 02:26:42,795
Take your gun,
shoot that nigger dead.

2441
02:26:42,920 --> 02:26:46,757
Then we sit here all nice-like
for the next two days.

2442
02:26:46,882 --> 02:26:50,052
When the snow melts, we go to
Mexico, you go on to Red Rock,

2443
02:26:50,177 --> 02:26:52,179
get that star
pinned on your chest.

2444
02:26:52,305 --> 02:26:55,308
Hey, Pete.
How much can we pay him?

2445
02:26:55,433 --> 02:26:59,645
Well, we could give him Marco.

2446
02:27:01,314 --> 02:27:04,859
Bob's real name
is Marco the Mexican.

2447
02:27:04,984 --> 02:27:07,445
He's worth $12,000.

2448
02:27:07,570 --> 02:27:09,780
That's Marco the Mexican?

2449
02:27:09,905 --> 02:27:11,741
Precisely, yeah.

2450
02:27:11,866 --> 02:27:13,534
Flaughsy
Shit.

2451
02:27:13,659 --> 02:27:17,621
Now that I blowed his face off,
Marco ain't worth a peso.

2452
02:27:17,747 --> 02:27:19,373
Uaughs)

2453
02:27:19,498 --> 02:27:20,374
on! <i>'</i>

2454
02:27:20,499 --> 02:27:22,043
Oh, sh... Oh, sh...

2455
02:27:22,168 --> 02:27:24,962
Well, then, if I die
in the next two days,

2456
02:27:25,087 --> 02:27:27,590
which is more than likely,
you can have me.

2457
02:27:27,715 --> 02:27:30,551
Under the name of
English Pete Hicox,

2458
02:27:30,676 --> 02:27:34,930
I got a federal bounty
of $15,000 on my head.

2459
02:27:37,350 --> 02:27:39,018
It's all yours, Chris.

2460
02:27:39,143 --> 02:27:42,104
You keep talking, Pete,

2461
02:27:42,229 --> 02:27:45,983
you gonna talk yourself
to death.

2462
02:27:46,108 --> 02:27:48,986
Joe Gage, who you be?

2463
02:27:49,111 --> 02:27:50,613
Grouch Douglass.

2464
02:27:52,406 --> 02:27:53,866
You heard of him?

2465
02:27:53,991 --> 02:27:56,327
Yeah, I heard
of Grouch Douglass.

2466
02:27:56,452 --> 02:27:59,872
He worth ten, just like Daisy.

2467
02:27:59,997 --> 02:28:02,083
Well, remind me...

2468
02:28:02,208 --> 02:28:07,380
why we wouldn't just
kill all y'all, cash in.

2469
02:28:07,505 --> 02:28:10,758
Oh, you can kill us all,
but you'll never spend a cent

2470
02:28:10,883 --> 02:28:12,176
of that bounty money,

2471
02:28:12,301 --> 02:28:14,678
and you'll never
leave this mountain alive.

2472
02:28:14,804 --> 02:28:17,139
'Cause when that snow melts,
the rest of Jody's gang,

2473
02:28:17,264 --> 02:28:21,310
all 15 of 'em that are waiting
in Red Rock, are coming here.

2474
02:28:21,435 --> 02:28:24,146
Now, l-let's say
you shoot us all.

2475
02:28:24,271 --> 02:28:27,900
If you really want all that
Domingre Gang bounty money,

2476
02:28:28,025 --> 02:28:31,028
you still got to get
all our corpses into Red Rock.

2477
02:28:31,153 --> 02:28:33,322
And that ain't
gonna be so easy.

2478
02:28:33,447 --> 02:28:35,699
'Cause I-l doubt you can drive
a four-horse team.

2479
02:28:35,825 --> 02:28:38,661
And that wagon out there is
too heavy for a two-horse team.

2480
02:28:38,786 --> 02:28:40,663
So that means
you're gonna have to lead

2481
02:28:40,788 --> 02:28:43,457
a string of horses
into Red Rock.

2482
02:28:43,582 --> 02:28:45,876
And with that deep snow
after a blizzard,

2483
02:28:46,001 --> 02:28:48,295
you ain't gonna be able
to get away with any more than,

2484
02:28:48,421 --> 02:28:50,464
say, one body per horse.

2485
02:28:50,589 --> 02:28:56,387
So that's you leading a string
of four horses into Red Rock.

2486
02:28:56,512 --> 02:29:00,015
And with all them horses
in that snow

2487
02:29:00,141 --> 02:29:03,102
and you all by your lonesome,
you're gonna be a mite poky.

2488
02:29:03,227 --> 02:29:05,563
And you're gonna run smack dab
into the Domingre Gang.

2489
02:29:05,688 --> 02:29:07,606
And again, Grouch,
how many is that?

2490
02:29:07,731 --> 02:29:09,066
15 killers strong.

2491
02:29:09,191 --> 02:29:13,946
And when those 15 killers
come across you

2492
02:29:14,071 --> 02:29:15,906
in possession of
all our dead bodies,

2493
02:29:16,031 --> 02:29:18,409
they ain't just gonna
kill you and that nigger!

2494
02:29:18,534 --> 02:29:20,453
They gonna go back to Red Rock

2495
02:29:20,578 --> 02:29:24,039
and kill every son of a bitch
in that town!

2496
02:29:24,165 --> 02:29:26,041
You really the sheriff
of Red Rock?

2497
02:29:26,167 --> 02:29:28,252
You want to save the town?

2498
02:29:28,377 --> 02:29:29,920
Then shoot that nigger dead!

2499
02:29:31,297 --> 02:29:33,007
Jesus Christ!

2500
02:29:33,132 --> 02:29:34,383
Oh, ho, ho!

2501
02:29:34,508 --> 02:29:36,844
You believe in Jesus now,
huh, bitch?

2502
02:29:36,969 --> 02:29:39,472
Well, good,
'cause you about to meet him.

2503
02:29:40,973 --> 02:29:42,892
Anybody else
want to make a deal? Huh?!

2504
02:29:43,017 --> 02:29:44,643
The deal still stands, Chris.

2505
02:29:46,395 --> 02:29:49,690
You ain't done nothing
we can't forgive.

2506
02:29:49,815 --> 02:29:53,194
It's all still on that nigger.

2507
02:29:53,319 --> 02:29:56,447
You shoot him dead,
take my body,

2508
02:29:56,572 --> 02:29:57,865
sit out in the snow

2509
02:29:57,990 --> 02:29:59,074
with Daisy and Grou...

2510
02:29:59,200 --> 02:30:00,618
You cunt!

2511
02:30:02,745 --> 02:30:04,872
<i>S'?</i>

2512
02:30:43,911 --> 02:30:46,455
Mannix,

2513
02:30:46,580 --> 02:30:50,084
give me my pistol.

2514
02:30:51,168 --> 02:30:53,587
Give it here!

2515
02:30:58,551 --> 02:31:00,636
Give it here!

2516
02:31:13,857 --> 02:31:18,028
So, you were saying...

2517
02:31:18,153 --> 02:31:22,324
we sit here,
all nice and friendly like,

2518
02:31:22,449 --> 02:31:24,159
for the next two days.

2519
02:31:24,285 --> 02:31:27,246
Then the snow melts,
you leave here,

2520
02:31:27,371 --> 02:31:31,500
meet up with your gang,
and hightail it to Mexico.

2521
02:31:31,625 --> 02:31:33,711
That's the deal, right?

2522
02:31:33,836 --> 02:31:35,087
Yeah.

2523
02:31:35,212 --> 02:31:41,010
And I get Oswaldo and Joe Gage?

2524
02:31:41,135 --> 02:31:42,970
Yeah.

2525
02:31:43,095 --> 02:31:45,264
But Jody's worth $50,000.
What about his body?

2526
02:31:45,389 --> 02:31:50,019
You gonna make a deal

2527
02:31:50,144 --> 02:31:56,233
with this diabolical bitch?

2528
02:31:56,358 --> 02:31:58,068
I ain't saying
I'm gonna make a deal with her.

2529
02:31:58,193 --> 02:31:59,153
We just talking.

2530
02:31:59,278 --> 02:32:02,489
Calm down!

2531
02:32:02,615 --> 02:32:05,367
So what about Jody's body
and the $50,000?

2532
02:32:05,492 --> 02:32:06,994
You're getting greedy, reb.

2533
02:32:07,119 --> 02:32:08,495
No deal.

2534
02:32:08,621 --> 02:32:10,122
We're taking Jody's body
back with us.

2535
02:32:10,247 --> 02:32:11,332
He got children.

2536
02:32:14,418 --> 02:32:19,923
So I kill Warren,
and we all friends?

2537
02:32:21,258 --> 02:32:23,093
Yeah.

2538
02:32:34,063 --> 02:32:36,106
No deal, tramp.

2539
02:32:36,231 --> 02:32:38,567
Chris!

2540
02:32:38,692 --> 02:32:41,362
You're making the biggest
mistake of your life!

2541
02:32:41,487 --> 02:32:43,447
When our boys get here
in a couple of days,

2542
02:32:43,572 --> 02:32:45,157
they're gonna
cut your nuts off!

2543
02:32:45,282 --> 02:32:48,786
And there won't be a stick left
in that town unburnt!

2544
02:32:48,911 --> 02:32:53,082
Well, I guess I should be
plumb scared right now, huh?

2545
02:32:54,541 --> 02:32:57,544
If you had any brains,
you would be!

2546
02:32:57,670 --> 02:32:59,421
You see...

2547
02:33:02,675 --> 02:33:04,593
...here's the problem, Daisy.

2548
02:33:04,718 --> 02:33:08,555
In order for me to be scared
of your threats,

2549
02:33:08,681 --> 02:33:11,558
I got to believe in
those 15 extra gang members

2550
02:33:11,684 --> 02:33:13,268
waiting it out in Red Rock.

2551
02:33:13,394 --> 02:33:17,856
And boy, oh, boy, I sure don't.

2552
02:33:20,109 --> 02:33:23,195
What I believe is,

2553
02:33:23,320 --> 02:33:29,159
Joe Gage or Grouch Douglass or
whatever the fuck his name was,

2554
02:33:29,284 --> 02:33:32,579
poisoned the coffee.

2555
02:33:32,705 --> 02:33:37,084
And you watched him do it.

2556
02:33:37,209 --> 02:33:41,672
And you watched me pour a cup,
and you didn't say shit!

2557
02:33:42,881 --> 02:33:44,299
And...

2558
02:33:44,425 --> 02:33:49,596
I believe you are
what you've always been,

2559
02:33:49,722 --> 02:33:54,017
a lying bitch
who will do anything

2560
02:33:54,143 --> 02:33:56,145
to cheat the rope
waiting for her in Red Rock,

2561
02:33:56,270 --> 02:33:59,940
including shitting out
15 extra gang members

2562
02:34:00,065 --> 02:34:02,693
whenever you need be.

2563
02:34:02,818 --> 02:34:05,195
Oh, oh!

2564
02:34:05,320 --> 02:34:07,740
And...

2565
02:34:10,826 --> 02:34:15,205
...I believe, when it comes
to what's left

2566
02:34:15,330 --> 02:34:20,627
of the Jody Domingre Gang,
I'm looking at 'em.

2567
02:34:20,753 --> 02:34:23,380
Right here, right now,

2568
02:34:23,505 --> 02:34:26,508
dead on this
motherfucking floor!

2569
02:34:26,633 --> 02:34:28,385
Goddamn right.

2570
02:34:28,510 --> 02:34:32,639
Then you're gonna die
on this mountain, Chris.

2571
02:34:32,765 --> 02:34:36,018
'Cause my brother
leads an army of men.

2572
02:34:36,143 --> 02:34:39,021
Horseshit!

2573
02:34:39,146 --> 02:34:41,982
My daddy led an army.

2574
02:34:42,107 --> 02:34:45,652
He led a renegade army,
fighting for a lost cause!

2575
02:34:45,778 --> 02:34:49,281
My daddy held up to 400 men
together after the war

2576
02:34:49,406 --> 02:34:53,744
with nothing but their respect
in his command!

2577
02:34:53,869 --> 02:34:56,789
Your brother's just an owl hoot
who led a gang of killers!

2578
02:35:00,000 --> 02:35:01,502
I don't feel so good.

2579
02:35:03,212 --> 02:35:04,922
Oh, shit.

2580
02:35:07,841 --> 02:35:09,176
Ha!

2581
02:35:15,474 --> 02:35:17,434
You still alive, white boy?

2582
02:35:18,560 --> 02:35:21,271
Fuck!

2583
02:35:25,692 --> 02:35:27,319
Mannix!

2584
02:35:29,321 --> 02:35:31,198
Hey, boy!

2585
02:35:38,455 --> 02:35:39,706
Get up!

2586
02:35:45,504 --> 02:35:47,047
Chris Mannix!

2587
02:35:47,172 --> 02:35:50,384
If your ass ain't nailed
to the floor, wake the fuck up!

2588
02:35:58,642 --> 02:36:00,602
Wake up, white boy!

2589
02:36:17,244 --> 02:36:18,537
<i>(gunman</i>

2590
02:36:22,416 --> 02:36:25,252
I ain't dead yet,
you black bastard.

2591
02:36:36,263 --> 02:36:41,143
Chris Mannix,
I may have misjudged you.

2592
02:36:41,268 --> 02:36:44,229
Now we've come
to the part of the story...

2593
02:36:47,149 --> 02:36:50,068
...where I blow
your goddamn head off.

2594
02:36:50,193 --> 02:36:52,446
No! No, no, don't shoot her!

2595
02:36:52,571 --> 02:36:54,948
Why the hell not?

2596
02:36:55,073 --> 02:36:56,950
John Ruth.

2597
02:37:02,414 --> 02:37:08,545
Now, John Ruth was
one mighty, mighty bastard.

2598
02:37:13,800 --> 02:37:19,640
But the last thing
that bastard did 'fore he died

2599
02:37:19,765 --> 02:37:21,558
was save your life.

2600
02:37:21,683 --> 02:37:24,895
We gonna die, white boy.

2601
02:37:25,020 --> 02:37:26,730
We ain't got no say in that.

2602
02:37:29,441 --> 02:37:33,195
But there is one thing left
we do have a say in.

2603
02:37:33,320 --> 02:37:37,157
And that's
how we kill this bitch.

2604
02:37:38,700 --> 02:37:41,495
And I say shooting's
too good for her.

2605
02:37:41,620 --> 02:37:47,542
John Ruth could've shot her
anywhere anytime along the way.

2606
02:37:47,668 --> 02:37:52,589
But John Ruth was The Hangman.

2607
02:37:52,714 --> 02:37:54,675
And when The Hangman
catches you,

2608
02:37:54,800 --> 02:37:58,345
you don't die by no bullet.

2609
02:37:58,470 --> 02:38:02,683
When The Hangman catches you,
you hang.

2610
02:38:02,808 --> 02:38:05,936
"You only need to hang
mean bastards..."

2611
02:38:06,061 --> 02:38:07,479
Mm-hmm.

2612
02:38:07,604 --> 02:38:11,149
"...but mean bastards,
you need to hang."

2613
02:38:34,047 --> 02:38:37,884
As my first and final act

2614
02:38:38,010 --> 02:38:41,138
as the sheriff of Red Rock,

2615
02:38:41,263 --> 02:38:44,016
I sentence you, Domergue,

2616
02:38:44,141 --> 02:38:47,394
to hang by the neck
until death!

2617
02:39:02,200 --> 02:39:04,036
Hang on, Daisy.

2618
02:39:04,161 --> 02:39:06,246
I want to watch.

2619
02:39:40,739 --> 02:39:43,742
Now, that was a nice dance.

2620
02:39:43,867 --> 02:39:45,494
Oh.

2621
02:39:45,619 --> 02:39:48,705
That sure was pretty.

2622
02:39:53,210 --> 02:39:54,086
Shit!

2623
02:40:41,258 --> 02:40:42,759
- Hey.

2624
02:40:44,803 --> 02:40:47,180
Can I see that Lincoln letter?

2625
02:41:29,973 --> 02:41:33,435
"Dear Marquis,

2626
02:41:33,560 --> 02:41:36,730
"I hope this letter finds you

2627
02:41:36,855 --> 02:41:41,151
"in good health and stead.

2628
02:41:41,276 --> 02:41:43,778
"I'm doing fine,

2629
02:41:43,904 --> 02:41:48,825
"although I wish there were
more hours in a day.

2630
02:41:48,950 --> 02:41:52,370
"There's just so much to do.

2631
02:41:52,495 --> 02:41:56,958
"Times are changing
slowly but surely,

2632
02:41:57,083 --> 02:42:02,088
"and it's men like you
that will make a difference.

2633
02:42:02,214 --> 02:42:08,470
"Your military success
is a credit not only to you,

2634
02:42:08,595 --> 02:42:11,598
"but your race as well.

2635
02:42:11,723 --> 02:42:17,229
"I'm very proud
every time I hear news of you.

2636
02:42:17,354 --> 02:42:21,483
"We still have
a long way to go,

2637
02:42:21,608 --> 02:42:28,114
"but hand in hand,
I know we will get there.

2638
02:42:28,240 --> 02:42:33,536
"I just want to let you know
you're in my thoughts.

2639
02:42:33,662 --> 02:42:39,000
"Hopefully, our paths
will cross in the future.

2640
02:42:39,125 --> 02:42:46,132
"Until then,
I remain your friend.

2641
02:42:46,258 --> 02:42:49,219
"Ole Mary Todd's calling,

2642
02:42:49,344 --> 02:42:54,975
"so I guess
it must be time for bed.

2643
02:42:55,100 --> 02:43:00,063
Respectfully, Abraham Lincoln."

2644
02:43:03,984 --> 02:43:06,236
"Ole Mary Todd."

2645
02:43:06,361 --> 02:43:08,697
That's a nice touch.

2646
02:43:08,822 --> 02:43:11,283
Yeah.

2647
02:43:11,408 --> 02:43:13,368
Thanks.
