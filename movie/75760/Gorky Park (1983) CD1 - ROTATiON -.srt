1
00:00:00,509 --> 00:00:05,663
How about, um,
100 good French condoms?

2
00:00:05,749 --> 00:00:08,024
- All colors.
- 100?

3
00:00:08,109 --> 00:00:11,465
Mm. It's just about enough
for a weekend, eh?

4
00:00:11,549 --> 00:00:14,746
- The chest.
- It's in the bathroom.

5
00:00:21,549 --> 00:00:23,904
There's no room for it in there.

6
00:00:23,989 --> 00:00:27,902
I don't want the damn thing
clutterin' up my nice room, anyway.

7
00:01:14,509 --> 00:01:20,106
Comrade Prosecutor, Golodkin
was of some assistance to KGB.

8
00:01:20,189 --> 00:01:22,908
- You know how it is.
- An informer, you mean.

9
00:01:22,989 --> 00:01:27,744
<i>- Well, it is our case.
- What do you mean "your case"?</i>

10
00:01:28,629 --> 00:01:32,383
- You festering baboon.
- And we have already determined

11
00:01:32,469 --> 00:01:36,382
that Golodkin shot your man and
then turned his own gun upon himself.

12
00:01:36,469 --> 00:01:40,064
- Very swift deduction. Congratulations.
- Your man was unarmed.

13
00:01:40,149 --> 00:01:44,347
It was that file, wasn't it?
It was a trap. A trap!

14
00:01:44,429 --> 00:01:47,865
- I have no idea what you're talking about.
- Listen!

15
00:01:47,949 --> 00:01:52,181
<i>- You killed him! It was you!
- Arkady! Arkady!</i>

16
00:01:52,269 --> 00:01:54,260
Pull yourself together.

17
00:02:06,149 --> 00:02:09,539
<i> There is an American
who is a link to everything. </i>

18
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:12,268
<i> Oh? Who?</i>

19
00:02:12,349 --> 00:02:15,421
<i> An American who knew
all three of them. </i>

20
00:02:15,509 --> 00:02:18,501
An American who had
dealings with Golodkin.

21
00:02:19,589 --> 00:02:22,467
An American who has
very powerful friends.

22
00:02:22,549 --> 00:02:25,109
- KGB friends.
- Who?

23
00:02:25,189 --> 00:02:27,987
An acquaintance of yours, I'm...

24
00:02:28,909 --> 00:02:30,547
Osborne.

25
00:02:30,629 --> 00:02:33,189
Osborne? Jack Osborne?

26
00:02:34,749 --> 00:02:38,947
Why would an American businessman kill
three nobodies in the middle of Moscow?

27
00:02:39,029 --> 00:02:41,020
I don't know.

28
00:02:42,109 --> 00:02:43,827
- Unless...
- Unless what?

29
00:02:43,909 --> 00:02:47,026
Unless they were all involved
in something so big

30
00:02:47,109 --> 00:02:51,341
that Osborne had to make sure
his partners would never, ever talk.

31
00:02:52,509 --> 00:02:54,500
- Jack Osborne.
- Yes.

32
00:02:57,069 --> 00:03:00,027
Are you sure? Quite sure?

33
00:03:00,109 --> 00:03:02,623
In my bones.

34
00:03:03,069 --> 00:03:05,344
Well, then...

35
00:03:05,429 --> 00:03:07,420
go after him.

36
00:03:08,309 --> 00:03:11,107
He's at the Metropole Hotel.

37
00:03:12,469 --> 00:03:14,744
Rattle him.

38
00:03:14,829 --> 00:03:17,468
Trip him up.

39
00:04:06,349 --> 00:04:09,386
Where is Valerya? You have to tell me.

40
00:04:09,989 --> 00:04:11,820
Safe.

41
00:04:11,909 --> 00:04:14,548
Please. I must know.

42
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:16,745
At this precise moment?

43
00:04:16,829 --> 00:04:20,822
Certainly finishing her lunchtime
apéritif in Manhattan.

44
00:04:23,189 --> 00:04:25,749
Come to my room.

45
00:04:26,629 --> 00:04:28,142
Please.

46
00:07:11,109 --> 00:07:13,748
<i> Let me go!</i>

47
00:07:33,709 --> 00:07:35,700
Go away. I'm KGB.

48
00:08:12,269 --> 00:08:15,625
Why'd you come in
through the window, Boris?

49
00:08:15,709 --> 00:08:17,381
What?

50
00:08:17,469 --> 00:08:20,142
The door was open.

51
00:08:27,469 --> 00:08:29,983
<i>- Who is she?
- Irina Asanova. </i>

52
00:08:30,069 --> 00:08:32,947
She knew your brother and the other two.

53
00:08:33,029 --> 00:08:38,057
We've got to get her temperature down
quicker. Get some ice from my fridge.

54
00:08:38,149 --> 00:08:40,947
- Was she in on the killings?
- She thinks they got out.

55
00:08:41,029 --> 00:08:44,544
She can't believe they're dead.
But she's the key.

56
00:08:47,069 --> 00:08:51,585
Jesus Christ! What the hell kind
of a diet are you on, anyway, pal?

57
00:08:51,669 --> 00:08:53,660
Bring the ice.

58
00:08:59,989 --> 00:09:02,708
What the hell is that?

59
00:09:02,789 --> 00:09:06,748
I had it reconstructed from
one of the Gorky Park heads.

60
00:09:06,829 --> 00:09:08,421
Why?

61
00:09:09,269 --> 00:09:12,067
The killer had sliced off their faces.

62
00:09:13,749 --> 00:09:15,148
Shit.

63
00:09:15,229 --> 00:09:19,461
She'll be in a bad way when she comes
round, and if she sees that head...

64
00:09:19,549 --> 00:09:21,938
I'll take it.

65
00:09:26,149 --> 00:09:30,301
She's going to be all right.
He didn't get enough into her veins.

66
00:09:30,389 --> 00:09:33,267
Renko, give me somethin'.

67
00:09:33,349 --> 00:09:36,147
Give me somethin' to work on.

68
00:09:38,029 --> 00:09:40,020
Come on.

69
00:09:42,109 --> 00:09:45,306
I believe the three were making a chest.

70
00:09:45,389 --> 00:09:49,064
A religious chest for
the black market in icons.

71
00:09:49,149 --> 00:09:52,107
- Yeah. And?
- Their clothing.

72
00:09:52,549 --> 00:09:55,347
Beside the traces of gold and gesso...

73
00:09:57,549 --> 00:10:02,339
there were spots of chicken
and fish blood. I don't know why.

74
00:10:03,229 --> 00:10:07,745
I've been in Soviet markets. I've never
seen anything fresh enough to bleed.

75
00:10:07,829 --> 00:10:11,504
- I'll be seeing you.
- I'm very grateful to you.

76
00:10:13,949 --> 00:10:18,022
Well, when you took that shot
at me you aimed away.

77
00:10:19,029 --> 00:10:21,099
Not by much.

78
00:10:21,189 --> 00:10:23,987
By enough. Maybe you're for real.

79
00:10:26,829 --> 00:10:29,980
Maybe you just don't shoot very well.

80
00:10:30,709 --> 00:10:33,746
You'll never know, will you?

81
00:11:19,469 --> 00:11:22,381
Why did you save my life?

82
00:11:22,469 --> 00:11:25,267
You're important to my investigation.

83
00:11:26,029 --> 00:11:29,704
- Now what?
- Well, when your clothes are dry, you go.

84
00:11:30,709 --> 00:11:32,222
Where?

85
00:11:32,309 --> 00:11:34,903
It's up to you.

86
00:11:35,589 --> 00:11:37,147
Home.

87
00:11:37,229 --> 00:11:40,027
They'll be waiting for me.

88
00:11:42,469 --> 00:11:45,506
Friends, then. You must have
someone you can stay with.

89
00:11:45,589 --> 00:11:48,387
And get them into trouble as well?

90
00:11:51,509 --> 00:11:54,103
- Citizen Asanova...
- Irina.

91
00:11:56,229 --> 00:11:58,789
You've undressed me.

92
00:11:59,789 --> 00:12:01,939
Irina.

93
00:12:02,029 --> 00:12:05,385
- This is the worst place for you to be.
- It's very simple.

94
00:12:05,469 --> 00:12:09,587
Either you are with them, and it doesn't
matter where I run, or you are not and...

95
00:12:09,669 --> 00:12:13,457
<i>- You'll be trapped here. They saw me.
- We'd be trapped here. </i>

96
00:12:13,549 --> 00:12:15,904
I can't take care of you.

97
00:12:15,989 --> 00:12:18,867
You've got two plates, two cups.

98
00:12:19,589 --> 00:12:21,978
Why did you go to the hotel?

99
00:12:22,869 --> 00:12:26,782
- What is Osborne to you?
- A friend.

100
00:12:26,869 --> 00:12:30,145
A friend? What sort of friend?

101
00:12:30,229 --> 00:12:33,062
Is he the one you think
got them out? Is that it?

102
00:12:33,149 --> 00:12:34,901
No questions.

103
00:12:37,629 --> 00:12:39,620
Irina.

104
00:12:39,709 --> 00:12:42,621
My friend is dead. Your friends are dead.

105
00:12:42,709 --> 00:12:46,338
- Why delude yourself? Why?
- Then why did KGB try to take me?

106
00:12:46,429 --> 00:12:49,660
Perhaps to protect the killer.
To protect Osborne.

107
00:12:49,749 --> 00:12:52,138
All I know is your friends were killed.

108
00:12:52,229 --> 00:12:54,459
- No!
- Irina, please.

109
00:12:54,549 --> 00:12:58,144
If I had a gun and I could
get out, I'd shoot you now.

110
00:13:00,869 --> 00:13:03,588
Here, take it.

111
00:13:03,669 --> 00:13:05,660
Take it.

112
00:13:07,669 --> 00:13:10,058
What are you waiting for?

113
00:13:17,949 --> 00:13:21,100
That's not going to get me out, is it?

114
00:14:39,229 --> 00:14:41,789
How are they killed?

115
00:14:41,869 --> 00:14:44,337
- Uh, who?
- Sables.

116
00:14:45,349 --> 00:14:48,466
- You don't think I kill them myself?
- Yes, I do.

117
00:14:48,549 --> 00:14:51,268
Oh, no, no, no. I do not soil my hands.

118
00:14:51,349 --> 00:14:55,501
I mean, do you kill the animal when you
eat his flesh or use his skin for boots?

119
00:14:55,589 --> 00:14:58,057
No. Like most of us I turn
my eyes from such things.

120
00:14:58,149 --> 00:15:01,300
- Exactly.
- I said like most of us.

121
00:15:01,389 --> 00:15:05,667
Yes, I suppose there are those
who enjoy the act of butchery.

122
00:15:05,749 --> 00:15:10,948
Especially if they feel
themselves superior beings.

123
00:15:11,509 --> 00:15:14,182
- Yes?
- What are we talking about?

124
00:15:14,269 --> 00:15:17,067
- Dead bodies in Gorky Park.
- Ah.

125
00:15:17,989 --> 00:15:21,186
- Doesn't it interest you?
- Me?

126
00:15:21,269 --> 00:15:24,181
I have established that
you knew all three of them.

127
00:15:24,269 --> 00:15:26,100
Have you, now?

128
00:15:26,189 --> 00:15:27,588
Well.

129
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:32,501
I met Stalin when I was young.
Did you know that?

130
00:15:33,869 --> 00:15:35,382
No.

131
00:15:35,469 --> 00:15:37,937
Well, you do know that Stalin is dead.

132
00:15:38,989 --> 00:15:43,301
Now, does the mere fact that I met him
prove that I killed him?

133
00:15:44,629 --> 00:15:48,702
- The sadist cut off their faces.
- Do you mind?

134
00:15:48,789 --> 00:15:51,587
In the same way he might skin an animal.

135
00:15:52,709 --> 00:15:55,098
A sable, perhaps.

136
00:15:55,189 --> 00:15:57,703
I don't think we'll be seeing
each other again.

137
00:15:57,789 --> 00:15:59,188
Oh?

138
00:16:00,909 --> 00:16:04,345
You once said that patience
was your only virtue.

139
00:16:05,749 --> 00:16:08,388
That you watch and you wait.

140
00:16:08,469 --> 00:16:13,259
I have only four days more in Moscow.
After that I'm leaving for good.

141
00:16:13,349 --> 00:16:16,466
However, I feel that you
deserve some reward.

142
00:16:18,469 --> 00:16:21,063
Expect a knock at your door.

143
00:16:21,989 --> 00:16:25,504
I'm having that sable hat delivered to you.

144
00:16:39,789 --> 00:16:43,384
- It was good. Thank you.
- Anybody can cook stew.

145
00:16:44,669 --> 00:16:47,467
You could burn it. I do.

146
00:16:49,669 --> 00:16:51,819
Irina?

147
00:16:51,909 --> 00:16:53,900
Help me, please.

148
00:17:01,589 --> 00:17:04,899
How do I know the attack on me
wasn't staged to make me trust you?

149
00:17:04,989 --> 00:17:06,581
Irina.

150
00:17:13,509 --> 00:17:17,138
How do I know that you didn't plan it
to make me betray my friends?

151
00:17:17,229 --> 00:17:19,345
Like Osborne, you mean.

152
00:17:20,069 --> 00:17:22,060
Your friend Osborne.

153
00:17:24,509 --> 00:17:28,582
Let's talk about Osborne.
Tell me about Osborne.

154
00:17:28,669 --> 00:17:31,467
Is that all you can do? Talk?

155
00:17:32,189 --> 00:17:33,861
Talk?

156
00:17:33,949 --> 00:17:36,383
Irina, listen.

157
00:17:38,949 --> 00:17:41,782
You don't have to talk so much.

158
00:17:42,669 --> 00:17:45,467
Irina, I am your friend.

159
00:17:51,189 --> 00:17:53,498
No. My enemy.

160
00:17:58,909 --> 00:18:04,222
Everything I've told you... is either
an extraordinarily elaborate lie...

161
00:18:05,469 --> 00:18:07,903
or the very simple truth.

162
00:18:12,429 --> 00:18:14,943
It's a lie.

163
00:18:36,989 --> 00:18:38,980
No! No!

164
00:18:42,589 --> 00:18:45,342
They're not dead. They're not dead.

165
00:18:45,429 --> 00:18:48,227
Don't hold back. Let it out. Let it come.

166
00:18:55,069 --> 00:18:56,787
I'm...

167
00:18:56,869 --> 00:18:59,383
Arkady, I'm going out of my mind.

168
00:18:59,469 --> 00:19:01,937
I don't know what's going on or who to...

169
00:19:02,829 --> 00:19:05,707
Irina, listen to me. I won't tell you lies.

170
00:19:07,349 --> 00:19:10,227
- No, you're tormenting me.
- No. No, Irina.

171
00:19:21,669 --> 00:19:26,789
It doesn't matter how ridiculous a lie is
if it's your only chance of escape.

172
00:19:26,869 --> 00:19:28,700
No. Irina, no.

173
00:19:28,789 --> 00:19:34,022
It doesn't matter how obvious the truth is
if the truth is that you'll never escape.

174
00:19:34,109 --> 00:19:35,701
Irina.

175
00:21:18,269 --> 00:21:21,386
<i> So this Irina was
a friend of my brother. </i>

176
00:21:21,469 --> 00:21:24,267
At the university before he was deported.

177
00:21:24,349 --> 00:21:27,500
Why did he come back?

178
00:21:27,589 --> 00:21:32,105
Jimmy wanted to be a fuckin' hero.
You gotta turn right, right here.

179
00:21:32,189 --> 00:21:36,307
He was determined to smuggle somebody
out of the Soviet Union.

180
00:21:36,389 --> 00:21:39,187
Anybody, even if they didn't wanna go.

181
00:21:40,269 --> 00:21:42,464
How come you know so much about us?

182
00:21:42,549 --> 00:21:45,621
My grandmother. She was one
of you. She was a Russian.

183
00:21:45,709 --> 00:21:48,781
I spoke Russian before I spoke English.

184
00:21:48,869 --> 00:21:52,179
Jimmy was... He was always
obsessed with this country.

185
00:21:52,269 --> 00:21:54,624
It's all he ever talked about.

186
00:21:54,709 --> 00:21:58,065
All right. You gotta turn left
in here and then park.

187
00:21:59,309 --> 00:22:02,381
<i>- Heard of born-again Christians?
- No. </i>

188
00:22:02,469 --> 00:22:07,259
Born-again Christians. They don't smoke,
they don't swear, they don't fuck.

189
00:22:07,349 --> 00:22:11,945
All they do is talk about Jesus
and try to walk on the goddamn water.

190
00:22:13,189 --> 00:22:16,226
That was Jimmy, God love him.

191
00:22:20,149 --> 00:22:24,062
- That's it over there.
- How'd you find this place?

192
00:22:25,749 --> 00:22:28,821
I got a nose for fresh fish
and chicken blood.

193
00:22:30,509 --> 00:22:32,420
What a stench.

194
00:22:32,509 --> 00:22:35,945
This is where they made the chest.
That's how they got 'em out.

195
00:22:36,029 --> 00:22:39,624
- Live sables.
- Bingo. They fed 'em the fresh meat.

196
00:22:40,629 --> 00:22:42,665
Six live sables.

197
00:22:42,749 --> 00:22:45,388
I'm no expert on sable shit
but, yeah, I think so.

198
00:22:45,469 --> 00:22:48,063
They'd be worth how much
to an American?

199
00:22:48,149 --> 00:22:52,427
Freedom. Smash the monopoly. How
high can you count? Worth killing for.

200
00:22:52,509 --> 00:22:55,023
Motive.

201
00:22:55,109 --> 00:22:57,418
Evidence.

202
00:22:57,509 --> 00:22:59,500
Circumstantial.

203
00:23:01,349 --> 00:23:03,943
Witness.

204
00:23:04,029 --> 00:23:06,748
In your apartment, Arkady.

205
00:23:06,829 --> 00:23:10,822
She's got to tell me, now.
Osborne is leaving in three days.

206
00:23:14,349 --> 00:23:16,544
Don't kill him.

207
00:23:17,469 --> 00:23:19,460
Not yet.

208
00:23:28,669 --> 00:23:31,467
What is it, Arkasha?

209
00:23:31,549 --> 00:23:34,905
I have no sugar for your tea.

210
00:23:34,989 --> 00:23:37,583
I don't need it.

211
00:23:40,429 --> 00:23:43,626
Do you still think I'm lying to you?

212
00:23:43,709 --> 00:23:48,260
- That I am just a militia investigator?
- Arkasha...

213
00:23:48,349 --> 00:23:52,467
Do you imagine I'm trying to trap you,
that this is all just a terrible game?

214
00:23:52,549 --> 00:23:54,346
No.

215
00:23:56,949 --> 00:23:59,144
But...

216
00:23:59,229 --> 00:24:01,220
But what?

217
00:24:03,469 --> 00:24:06,939
- If Valerya is safe somewhere...
- Irina, I love you.

218
00:24:07,029 --> 00:24:09,259
I... Arkasha...

219
00:24:09,349 --> 00:24:11,863
Help me.

220
00:24:13,669 --> 00:24:16,547
I've learned to trust nothing.

221
00:24:16,629 --> 00:24:18,620
Nobody.

222
00:24:19,629 --> 00:24:21,028
Never.

223
00:24:21,109 --> 00:24:22,701
Irina.

224
00:24:23,669 --> 00:24:26,581
If Valerya is safe somewhere, I...

225
00:24:28,149 --> 00:24:31,903
And if she is dead, she is dead.
How can I help her?

226
00:24:43,429 --> 00:24:45,897
- Let's go.
- Arkady.

227
00:24:47,069 --> 00:24:49,424
You talk too easily about dying.

228
00:25:01,349 --> 00:25:04,261
Where are we going, Arkasha?

229
00:25:04,349 --> 00:25:06,419
You'll see.

230
00:25:40,069 --> 00:25:43,106
You know who was here, don't you?

231
00:25:43,189 --> 00:25:45,180
Come on!

232
00:25:45,269 --> 00:25:46,668
No.

233
00:25:48,069 --> 00:25:50,867
Then what else can I do?

234
00:26:03,589 --> 00:26:05,580
Little Jimmy.

235
00:26:09,389 --> 00:26:11,983
Kostia, the big man.

236
00:26:14,589 --> 00:26:17,740
Valerya, you. Let us reconstruct.

237
00:26:17,829 --> 00:26:20,901
- Please. Arkady, don't.
- There's three of you.

238
00:26:20,989 --> 00:26:25,505
You believe a whole new life
is about to begin. Yes. Glide.

239
00:26:25,589 --> 00:26:28,387
<i>Glide. Valerya and Kostia and Jimmy. </i>

240
00:26:29,709 --> 00:26:32,382
<i>Let your skates bite and hiss. </i>

241
00:26:32,469 --> 00:26:38,021
<i>Your very movement reminds you of the
freedom that will soon be yours. Glide. </i>

242
00:26:38,749 --> 00:26:41,343
Glide, my little ones.

243
00:26:41,429 --> 00:26:43,420
Ah, Valerya.

244
00:26:44,229 --> 00:26:48,302
The little bird. She's wearing her
friend's skates. Her good friend.

245
00:26:48,389 --> 00:26:51,586
But there's someone else watching.

246
00:26:52,469 --> 00:26:57,020
Isn't there? Someone who
beckons them from the ice.

247
00:26:57,109 --> 00:27:01,182
Oh, happy Valerya. Trusting
Valerya. Innocent Valerya.

248
00:27:01,269 --> 00:27:04,227
I'm their savior from the West.
It's laughter and toasts.

249
00:27:04,309 --> 00:27:06,425
Hear the music?

250
00:27:06,509 --> 00:27:11,378
Ah, we need another bottle.
Why not? I sort through the bag.

251
00:27:11,469 --> 00:27:14,586
I feel the grip of the gun.

252
00:27:17,269 --> 00:27:20,306
I turn to Kostia and I smile.

253
00:27:21,589 --> 00:27:22,863
And...

254
00:27:27,589 --> 00:27:30,467
<i>Jimmy doesn't know what's
happening. How can this be? </i>

255
00:27:30,549 --> 00:27:34,781
Osborne had used him to gull the others.
He had been brought back into Russia

256
00:27:34,869 --> 00:27:38,908
as proof that Osborne could get
people in and out. Isn't that so?

257
00:27:40,309 --> 00:27:43,585
Poor Jimmy. Idealistic Jimmy
who only wanted to help.

258
00:27:43,669 --> 00:27:47,184
The Christian who now
must turn the other cheek.

259
00:27:55,709 --> 00:27:58,746
- What about Valerya?
- No, Arkady.

260
00:27:58,829 --> 00:28:01,741
- No.
- My love, why don't you stop me?

261
00:28:01,829 --> 00:28:05,060
Do I have to be the killer?
I have to have a witness.

262
00:28:05,149 --> 00:28:08,539
Someone must tell me.

263
00:28:11,269 --> 00:28:14,102
You must tell me.

264
00:28:14,189 --> 00:28:16,225
I can't.

265
00:28:19,749 --> 00:28:22,627
She doesn't scream. Doesn't run.

266
00:28:22,709 --> 00:28:24,700
What's the point?

267
00:28:24,789 --> 00:28:28,065
Her life, her hopes... done.

268
00:28:29,309 --> 00:28:33,746
This man has made love to her. He can
bring the gun as close as he wants.

269
00:28:33,829 --> 00:28:37,708
He can almost caress her with it
and she'll welcome the bullet.

270
00:28:44,109 --> 00:28:45,940
No.

271
00:28:46,029 --> 00:28:47,508
Yes.

272
00:29:01,149 --> 00:29:03,140
<i>But what of Valerya's friend? </i>

273
00:29:03,229 --> 00:29:08,303
What about you? She won't tell because
she wants Valerya to be in America, free.

274
00:29:08,389 --> 00:29:14,544
She won't tell because Osborne has
told her she is to be the next to get out,

275
00:29:14,629 --> 00:29:19,783
and this fantasy is the most
important thing in her life.

276
00:29:19,869 --> 00:29:22,383
It's all that keeps her going.

277
00:29:22,469 --> 00:29:24,266
Yes.

278
00:29:30,669 --> 00:29:33,467
So, the question is, where is Valerya?

279
00:29:35,549 --> 00:29:37,540
New York.

280
00:29:38,469 --> 00:29:41,063
She's in New York.

281
00:29:50,549 --> 00:29:52,938
But in Moscow...

282
00:29:56,869 --> 00:29:59,667
the great Professor Andreev...

283
00:30:00,549 --> 00:30:02,983
can reconstruct a head.

284
00:30:04,229 --> 00:30:06,220
A face.

285
00:30:07,069 --> 00:30:09,185
From the bones and tissue alone.

286
00:30:09,269 --> 00:30:11,942
No. Hope is all I know.

287
00:30:12,029 --> 00:30:14,020
Here is Valerya.

288
00:30:14,749 --> 00:30:17,422
V- Valerya. Valerya. Valerya!

289
00:30:23,109 --> 00:30:25,339
- Valerya who?
- Valerya Davidova.

290
00:30:25,429 --> 00:30:27,704
- The others?
- Kostia Borodin. James Kirwill.

291
00:30:27,789 --> 00:30:30,781
- What were they doing here?
- Making a chest for Osborne.

292
00:30:30,869 --> 00:30:32,939
American furrier, Jack Osborne?

293
00:30:33,029 --> 00:30:35,020
Yes, Jack Osborne.

294
00:30:35,789 --> 00:30:39,498
You saw what they brought
Osborne here from Siberia.

295
00:30:39,589 --> 00:30:41,944
Tell me. Say it.

296
00:30:42,029 --> 00:30:43,462
Sables.

297
00:30:43,549 --> 00:30:46,347
Live, dead, pelts, what?

298
00:30:46,429 --> 00:30:49,341
- Live sables.
- How many?

299
00:30:49,429 --> 00:30:52,148
Six sables.

300
00:30:52,229 --> 00:30:54,584
Six live sables.

301
00:30:54,669 --> 00:30:56,660
Good girl.

302
00:30:57,469 --> 00:30:59,460
I hate you.

303
00:31:04,429 --> 00:31:08,138
Irina, lies are not freedom.

304
00:31:08,229 --> 00:31:10,424
I hate you!

305
00:31:44,629 --> 00:31:46,620
Where'd she go?

306
00:31:49,229 --> 00:31:52,505
Think she's taken off with Osborne, huh?

307
00:31:56,029 --> 00:31:58,748
OK. Well, tell me where
we're going, will you?

308
00:31:58,829 --> 00:32:02,265
I need the other head.
Then I'll have enough.

309
00:32:02,909 --> 00:32:04,900
The other head?

310
00:32:24,669 --> 00:32:26,978
<i>- KGB?
- Yes. </i>

311
00:32:27,069 --> 00:32:30,823
But why would they steal the evidence?
It must be something else.

312
00:32:30,909 --> 00:32:33,981
- What else?
- Well...

313
00:32:35,069 --> 00:32:37,663
We'll see, won't we?

314
00:33:34,909 --> 00:33:37,707
What the hell are you doin'?

315
00:33:39,069 --> 00:33:41,583
You know where we are.

316
00:33:41,669 --> 00:33:44,229
Now I do.

317
00:33:54,389 --> 00:33:56,380
I'm a fool.

318
00:33:57,149 --> 00:34:00,425
- What does that mean?
- That I've missed everything.

319
00:34:00,989 --> 00:34:04,026
That's lamskoy, the chief
prosecutor of Moscow.

320
00:34:04,989 --> 00:34:08,345
And Jack Osborne. They've
been dealing the whole time.

321
00:34:09,509 --> 00:34:14,344
So now they'll deal with me.
I've no chance now, nowhere to go.

322
00:34:14,429 --> 00:34:16,226
They've beaten me.

323
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:20,664
Oh, God.

324
00:34:20,749 --> 00:34:22,865
Don't look.

325
00:35:09,909 --> 00:35:13,948
<i>- You'll be even richer.
- You won't be exactly poor. </i>

326
00:35:14,029 --> 00:35:17,817
<i> What can I spend it on here?
I wish I could come to Stockholm. </i>

327
00:35:17,909 --> 00:35:21,345
Diamonds look their best
on a young girl's throat.

328
00:35:21,429 --> 00:35:24,466
<i> You must never
again be seen with me. </i>

329
00:35:24,549 --> 00:35:27,382
But I'll send you a postcard
from Stockholm.

330
00:35:27,469 --> 00:35:29,460
Good luck, then.

331
00:35:53,909 --> 00:35:55,900
<i>- Bastard.
- Don't. </i>

332
00:35:56,949 --> 00:36:00,942
You're making a mistake. We're
on the same side. I promise you.

333
00:36:03,429 --> 00:36:06,023
We wanna talk to him.

334
00:36:13,709 --> 00:36:15,700
You're a fool!

335
00:36:15,789 --> 00:36:19,782
We don't need to talk to him.
Osborne's going to Stockholm.

336
00:36:21,669 --> 00:36:23,978
Stockholm!

337
00:36:24,069 --> 00:36:26,629
Come on! Get me out of this place.

338
00:36:26,709 --> 00:36:29,746
Come on! I wanna stay one step
ahead of that bastard.

339
00:36:29,829 --> 00:36:34,141
You on the outside and me on the inside,
looking at you from the morgue!

340
00:37:10,589 --> 00:37:13,979
I want you to promise me,
Anton, on your life...

341
00:37:15,309 --> 00:37:21,145
that you will take all this-papers, tape -
personally to the prosecutor general.

342
00:37:21,229 --> 00:37:24,107
On my life, I promise.

343
00:37:26,229 --> 00:37:30,108
- And give me your gun.
- Oh, Christ.

344
00:37:44,709 --> 00:37:47,303
It's a lawyer's special issue.

345
00:37:47,389 --> 00:37:50,187
It probably won't shoot straight.

346
00:37:55,949 --> 00:38:01,865
And if Irina ever turns up...
take care of her for me.

347
00:38:01,949 --> 00:38:05,419
Well, sure. I'll give her your beautiful car.

348
00:38:18,229 --> 00:38:21,426
- What are you going to do?
- A brisk walk.

349
00:38:24,629 --> 00:38:27,018
And a little dip.

350
00:38:50,629 --> 00:38:52,267
Arkady.

351
00:38:52,629 --> 00:38:57,623
The firing squad will not be quite
as much fun as Stockholm, will it?

352
00:39:05,909 --> 00:39:08,343
Arkady.

353
00:39:10,149 --> 00:39:12,947
You're out of... you're out of control.

354
00:39:16,149 --> 00:39:18,743
You kept me on the case
to put pressure on Osborne.

355
00:39:18,829 --> 00:39:21,901
He couldn't have been offering... enough.

356
00:39:21,989 --> 00:39:24,298
But you settled.

357
00:39:24,389 --> 00:39:26,823
The price must have been high.

358
00:39:26,909 --> 00:39:31,664
You should be looked after.
Certainly you should be looked after.

359
00:39:32,309 --> 00:39:34,823
How much?

360
00:39:36,749 --> 00:39:39,183
$100,000, American?

361
00:39:39,269 --> 00:39:43,262
Come on. You know
the value of live sables.

362
00:39:43,349 --> 00:39:46,546
This'll be worth tens
of millions to Osborne.

363
00:39:47,309 --> 00:39:49,539
Osborne was greedy.

364
00:39:49,629 --> 00:39:52,507
That's why I had to
threaten him with, uh...

365
00:39:52,589 --> 00:39:55,820
I was going to say my best man.

366
00:39:57,869 --> 00:40:00,463
150,000, hm? How about that?

367
00:41:36,349 --> 00:41:38,624
<i>- I've ordered stingers.
- Stingers. </i>

368
00:41:38,709 --> 00:41:41,223
- What's that?
- Cognac and crème de menthe.

369
00:41:41,309 --> 00:41:44,699
Which of the two is meant
to spoil the other?

370
00:41:44,789 --> 00:41:47,986
<i> In Sweden all
excesses are permitted. </i>

371
00:41:51,389 --> 00:41:55,860
Comrade Pribluda, when do I get
the gun, and where do I kill him?

372
00:41:57,589 --> 00:42:00,387
You will ask no questions.
You will make no comments.

373
00:42:00,469 --> 00:42:03,222
You will simply do as you're told.

374
00:42:03,309 --> 00:42:06,142
Consider yourself lucky to be still alive.

375
00:42:06,229 --> 00:42:12,225
Osborne will trade. He'll return the
six sables, but he'll only talk to you.

376
00:42:12,309 --> 00:42:15,267
And I don't like that, Renko.

377
00:42:15,349 --> 00:42:18,580
I'm warning you. Be very, very careful.

378
00:42:19,029 --> 00:42:21,623
Why will he trade?

379
00:42:22,989 --> 00:42:25,025
What will he trade?

380
00:42:27,269 --> 00:42:30,864
Which is the brandy?
Which is the crème de menthe?

381
00:42:32,069 --> 00:42:34,902
Let's see if you can tell, Renko.

382
00:42:40,989 --> 00:42:42,627
<i> Bruised, are we?</i>

383
00:42:42,709 --> 00:42:47,260
I imagine they wanted to make quite sure
you were telling the truth about lamskoy.

384
00:42:47,349 --> 00:42:50,739
Well, he didn't know
how good you were, did he?

385
00:42:51,629 --> 00:42:53,779
The fool.

386
00:42:53,869 --> 00:42:56,667
And now you're here to kill me.

387
00:42:57,509 --> 00:42:59,864
Right?

388
00:42:59,949 --> 00:43:01,746
Yes.

389
00:43:40,309 --> 00:43:41,788
What do you think?

390
00:43:41,869 --> 00:43:45,748
You know the KGB will always
track you down, wherever you are.

391
00:43:45,829 --> 00:43:47,467
Precisely.

392
00:43:47,549 --> 00:43:50,347
So, what exactly are you proposing?

393
00:43:54,509 --> 00:43:57,979
- Do not be unduly alarmed.
- What are you doing?

394
00:43:58,069 --> 00:44:01,061
You haven't seen
the rest of the house yet.

395
00:44:09,309 --> 00:44:12,984
Old houses are so like people,
don't you think?

396
00:44:13,069 --> 00:44:15,458
Full of surprises.

397
00:44:17,789 --> 00:44:19,984
- Open that door.
- What?

398
00:44:20,069 --> 00:44:22,060
Open the door.

399
00:44:37,789 --> 00:44:40,223
I made them bring you.

400
00:44:40,309 --> 00:44:43,221
You see, corruption is part of us.

401
00:44:43,309 --> 00:44:45,504
All of us.

402
00:44:45,589 --> 00:44:48,387
The very heart of us.

403
00:44:50,909 --> 00:44:52,820
Irina?

404
00:45:05,749 --> 00:45:09,537
Why should a woman sleep with a killer
unless she likes being hurt?

405
00:45:09,629 --> 00:45:11,187
- No!
- No?

406
00:45:11,269 --> 00:45:15,057
Then it's money that excites you,
perhaps? It's money?

407
00:45:15,149 --> 00:45:20,223
You've earned it, Irina. You paid with
the lives of your friends. What is this?

408
00:45:20,309 --> 00:45:23,107
Is this another one of his gifts?

409
00:45:23,909 --> 00:45:26,503
You're a whore, Irina.

410
00:45:27,669 --> 00:45:29,660
You're a whore.

411
00:45:31,869 --> 00:45:37,819
When you showed me the head -
Valerya's head - I decided to kill myself.

412
00:45:37,909 --> 00:45:39,900
- Melodrama.
- Yes.

413
00:45:41,509 --> 00:45:44,785
I went to Osborne instead.
I slept with him.

414
00:45:49,029 --> 00:45:54,945
I didn't feel dirty. I felt as though
a layer of my skin had been burnt away.

415
00:45:55,829 --> 00:46:00,027
- I knew what to do.
- Yes. Sell yourself.

416
00:46:01,269 --> 00:46:04,067
What else did I have to sell?

417
00:46:13,589 --> 00:46:16,467
I told him I knew everything.

418
00:46:16,549 --> 00:46:20,303
But I knew he wanted me. I told
you I'd do anything to get out.

419
00:46:20,389 --> 00:46:21,981
Anything.

420
00:46:22,069 --> 00:46:26,381
The second day in Stockholm I went
to the KGB. The Russian embassy.

421
00:46:26,469 --> 00:46:30,462
I told them I could get the sables back
if they would trade you for them,

422
00:46:30,549 --> 00:46:33,746
if they would let you out because...

423
00:46:33,829 --> 00:46:35,820
because I...

424
00:46:39,789 --> 00:46:41,859
Irina?

425
00:46:45,429 --> 00:46:47,818
I had to get you out.

426
00:46:47,909 --> 00:46:50,377
It was the only reason.

427
00:46:51,869 --> 00:46:55,259
Why would Osborne trade
the sables for me?

428
00:47:00,389 --> 00:47:03,620
He's got more than six, Arkasha.

429
00:47:03,709 --> 00:47:07,099
Valerya and the others helped him
use the route once before.

430
00:47:07,189 --> 00:47:09,578
He's got another six sables.

431
00:47:09,669 --> 00:47:13,264
And nobody knows it, except him and me.

432
00:47:15,749 --> 00:47:17,865
And now you.

433
00:47:47,549 --> 00:47:53,067
Frankly, I am astounded that your people
would understand a sexual obsession.

434
00:47:54,269 --> 00:47:59,104
But, well, it seems they understand that
I want her enough to trade the sables.

435
00:48:00,029 --> 00:48:02,702
Only she won't come without you.

436
00:48:02,789 --> 00:48:04,780
But they sent me here to kill you.

437
00:48:04,869 --> 00:48:07,941
But they'd rather have
their little furry friends back.

438
00:48:08,029 --> 00:48:11,146
- But my job is to kill you.
- What?

439
00:48:11,229 --> 00:48:14,027
Kill a man who keeps his promises?

440
00:48:16,709 --> 00:48:20,702
You see the hat that was not
delivered to you in Moscow.

441
00:48:20,789 --> 00:48:23,223
Barguzinsky sable. The finest.

442
00:48:23,309 --> 00:48:26,699
There's no more comparison
between this and ordinary fur

443
00:48:26,789 --> 00:48:30,179
than Irina's skin and that of other women.

444
00:48:31,189 --> 00:48:33,225
Feel it.

445
00:48:34,029 --> 00:48:39,057
You're sick, Osborne. Sick. I don't want
the hat or anything else from you.

446
00:48:39,149 --> 00:48:43,142
Oh, be forgiving. You want
to survive, don't you?

447
00:48:44,269 --> 00:48:48,262
Tomorrow, if you convince them,
the Soviets and I will trade.

448
00:48:48,349 --> 00:48:51,147
You and Irina for the six sables.

449
00:48:52,029 --> 00:48:54,259
Oh, and, uh, $200,000.

450
00:48:55,549 --> 00:48:57,540
Do you agree?

451
00:48:58,549 --> 00:49:00,028
Yes.

452
00:49:11,469 --> 00:49:14,222
A stinger, please. A stinger.

453
00:49:18,069 --> 00:49:21,266
- That's a whore's drink.
- I am a whore.

454
00:49:21,349 --> 00:49:23,499
- How many?
- Three upstairs. KGB.

455
00:49:23,589 --> 00:49:26,945
- Maybe more down here.
- OK. What's the score?

456
00:49:27,029 --> 00:49:29,782
- I'll give you one, two, three.
- OK. Shoot.

457
00:49:29,869 --> 00:49:31,461
One.

458
00:49:31,549 --> 00:49:36,464
Osborne is deceiving KGB into a swap.
Six sables for Irina and me, plus dollars.

459
00:49:37,429 --> 00:49:41,980
- But he's got more out than they know.
- When's the swap?

460
00:49:42,069 --> 00:49:45,266
- Tomorrow. They've bought it.
- OK. Two.

461
00:49:45,989 --> 00:49:50,505
Two. I am under orders from Moscow
to kill Osborne and the sables.

462
00:49:51,549 --> 00:49:54,461
- Three.
- Three. The KGB kills Osborne,

463
00:49:54,549 --> 00:49:57,939
you, the girl and the sables.
Am I right?

464
00:49:58,709 --> 00:50:01,507
- Correct.
- Does she know this?

465
00:50:02,349 --> 00:50:03,941
No.

466
00:50:06,909 --> 00:50:12,029
- You're in a hell of a jam. Did I tell you?
- Yes, thank you. Eat some of my peanuts.

467
00:50:12,109 --> 00:50:14,703
I'll be there. Good luck.

468
00:50:14,789 --> 00:50:17,986
- What are you doing?
- This is a whore's drink.

469
00:50:18,069 --> 00:50:22,540
- Give me that. Let's get out of here.
- We've got an early start.

470
00:50:33,029 --> 00:50:35,827
Son of a bitch.

471
00:51:29,749 --> 00:51:32,309
<i> Oh, no. </i>

472
00:51:36,269 --> 00:51:38,737
- Don't touch him.
- Oh...

473
00:51:39,709 --> 00:51:41,506
God, no.

474
00:51:41,589 --> 00:51:44,626
What are you up to, Renko?
What's he doing here?

475
00:51:44,709 --> 00:51:47,826
- What the hell is going on?
- Who is it? Who?

476
00:51:49,869 --> 00:51:51,860
A friend.

477
00:51:54,029 --> 00:51:56,020
<i> He killed my dogs. </i>

478
00:51:57,789 --> 00:52:01,748
I gutted him because he killed my dogs.

479
00:52:02,789 --> 00:52:05,257
<i> Now, Mr. Osborne. </i>

480
00:52:05,349 --> 00:52:08,739
Let's not concern ourselves
with the intruder.

481
00:52:08,829 --> 00:52:11,582
Are these the six sables?

482
00:52:11,669 --> 00:52:15,662
The sables are dead.
Throw down your guns.

483
00:52:16,389 --> 00:52:18,983
Not while you have yours.

484
00:52:19,509 --> 00:52:23,104
Mr. Osborne, everything is correct now.

485
00:52:23,669 --> 00:52:27,662
You may take Renko here. We take
the sables. No one needs guns.

486
00:52:28,349 --> 00:52:32,627
<i> The sables are dead.
I do not intend to join them. </i>

487
00:52:33,829 --> 00:52:36,468
<i> We're not thugs, Mr. Osborne. </i>

488
00:52:36,549 --> 00:52:39,063
If that's what you want,
you may have our weapons.

489
00:52:39,149 --> 00:52:42,107
- Rurik, Osborne will kill you.
- Stay out of this, you.

490
00:52:42,189 --> 00:52:46,182
Wake up. He'll kill all
of you, except Pribluda.

491
00:52:46,269 --> 00:52:48,624
- What?
- Pribluda is Osborne's man.

492
00:52:48,709 --> 00:52:52,827
- That's why he'll give up his gun.
- Renko, you're a liar.

493
00:53:10,229 --> 00:53:13,460
<i> It's all right. Renko is unarmed. </i>

494
00:53:13,549 --> 00:53:17,781
<i>- I made sure of that.
- Put the gun down. </i>

495
00:53:17,869 --> 00:53:21,179
- What?
- Put down the gun.

496
00:53:26,269 --> 00:53:27,338
Jack...

497
00:53:28,629 --> 00:53:30,426
listen.

498
00:53:31,949 --> 00:53:34,417
I've got the money.

499
00:53:41,789 --> 00:53:43,780
<i> Mr. Osborne. </i>

500
00:53:44,669 --> 00:53:47,467
On your right there are two more KGB.

501
00:53:55,949 --> 00:53:58,747
Keep your head down.

502
00:55:11,269 --> 00:55:13,544
Holy Peter.

503
00:56:05,149 --> 00:56:07,902
<i> Arkasha!</i>

504
00:56:07,989 --> 00:56:09,900
Irina, stay out!

505
00:56:30,509 --> 00:56:32,500
Step out, Renko.

506
00:56:34,149 --> 00:56:36,743
Or the girl is dead.

507
00:56:37,989 --> 00:56:39,980
No, Arkasha.

508
00:56:44,189 --> 00:56:45,827
Renko.

509
00:57:42,469 --> 00:57:45,063
That's a KGB gun.

510
00:58:06,829 --> 00:58:09,423
Now we can be free.

511
00:58:17,469 --> 00:58:19,266
Arkasha?

512
00:58:23,109 --> 00:58:25,304
Irina.

513
00:58:26,749 --> 00:58:29,661
I have to go back.

514
00:58:29,749 --> 00:58:31,341
No.

515
00:58:32,749 --> 00:58:36,628
I have to go back, otherwise
they will hunt you down.

516
00:58:36,709 --> 00:58:38,745
That was...

517
00:58:40,149 --> 00:58:45,269
That was the deal I made in Moscow.
Kill the sables. Kill Osborne. Go back.

518
00:58:46,309 --> 00:58:48,903
And you could go free.

519
00:58:50,389 --> 00:58:52,186
No.

520
00:58:53,909 --> 00:58:55,706
No.

521
00:58:59,109 --> 00:59:01,225
Irina, look at me.

522
00:59:01,309 --> 00:59:03,903
No, look at me.

523
00:59:06,269 --> 00:59:08,578
What do you see?

524
00:59:10,349 --> 00:59:12,340
A Russian.

525
00:59:13,309 --> 00:59:16,107
I never could be anything else.

526
00:59:19,189 --> 00:59:21,657
- Then I'll come back.
- No.

527
00:59:21,749 --> 00:59:24,547
You were dead there. Dying there.

528
00:59:27,709 --> 00:59:30,098
I will always...

529
00:59:31,189 --> 00:59:33,578
love you.

530
00:59:35,669 --> 00:59:37,466
Arkasha.

531
01:00:00,109 --> 01:00:02,100
One day, Irina.

532
01:00:05,869 --> 01:00:07,860
One day.

533
01:00:57,229 --> 01:01:01,268
Chief Investigator Renko reporting
for duty, Comrade General.

534
01:01:43,949 --> 01:01:46,702
<i> One day, Arkasha. </i>

535
01:01:46,789 --> 01:01:48,780
<i>One day. </i>

536
01:04:59,789 --> 01:05:03,577
