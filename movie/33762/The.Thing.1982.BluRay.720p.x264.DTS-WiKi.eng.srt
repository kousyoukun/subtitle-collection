This, for instance... that's not dog.

162
00:34:40,912 --> 00:34:44,164
It's imitation.
We got to it before it had time to finish.

163
00:34:46,375 --> 00:34:47,834

164
00:34:48,878 --> 00:34:51,046

00:35:12,443 --> 00:35:13,902
- Clark.
- Yeah?

168
00:35:13,986 --> 00:35:17,572
Did you notice anything strange
about the dog, anything at all?

169
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:19,199
Strange? No.

170
00:35:21,744 --> 00:35:23,954
What was the dog doing in the rec room?

171
00:35:24,539 --> 00:35:25,789
I don't know.

172
00:35:25,873 --> 00:35:28,250
He was just wandering around camp all day.

173
00:35:30,795 --> 00:35:34,881
Are you saying to me the dog wasn't put
in the kennel until last night?

174
00:35:35,049 --> 00:35:36,216
Right.

175
00:35:38,427 --> 00:35:40,387
How long were you alone with that dog?

176
00:35:40,888 --> 00:35:44,808
I don't know. An hour.
Hour and a half, maybe.

177

like that for?

178

- I don't know.
- What?

179
00:35:55,361 --> 00:35:57,404
I don't know. It's probably nothing.

180
00:36:00,658 --> 00:36:02,450
It's nothing at all.

181
00:36:13,254 --> 00:36:15,172
How much more of this crap is there?

182
00:36:15,256 --> 00:36:17,465
Oh, about nine hours, I'd say.

BLAIR: Where'd they take these shots?

185
00:36:36,527 --> 00:36:38,320
Seems like they were spending
a lot of their time

186
00:36:38,404 --> 00:36:41,114
in a little place northeast of their camp
about five or six miles.

FUCHS: What's that?

188
00:36:44,285 --> 00:36:46,661

buried under the ice.

189

CHILDS: And look at that.
They're planting thermite charges.

190
00:36:57,131 --> 00:37:00,425
GARRY: Whatever it was, it was bigger
than that block of ice you found.

191
00:37:10,228 --> 00:37:14,064
Here. This is it. The place where
they were spending most of their time.

192
00:37:14,148 --> 00:37:17,692
- Pretty nasty out, Mac. 35 knots.
- Screw it. I'm gonna go up anyway.

193
00:37:41,676 --> 00:37:43,301
Half a mile due east.

194
00:39:21,609 --> 00:39:24,486
Jesus, how long do you figure
this has been in the ice?

195
00:39:25,821 --> 00:39:29,282
Well, the backscatter effect's been
bringing things up

196
00:39:29,784 --> 00:39:32,410
from way down around here for a long time.

197
00:39:32,495 --> 00:39:37,123
I'd say... I'd say the ice it's buried in is
100,000 years old, at least.

198
00:39:40,378 --> 00:39:42,712
- And those Norwegians blew it up?
- Yeah.

I don't know.

200

Thousands of years ago, it crashes,
and this Thing...

201
00:40:18,332 --> 00:40:22,252
Gets thrown out or crawls out,
and it ends up freezing in the ice.

202

They practically own South America.

209
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:47,485
I mean, they taught the Incas
everything they know.

210
00:40:54,869 --> 00:40:56,161
Come on, now, MacReady.

211
00:40:56,245 --> 00:40:59,664
The Norwegians get a hold of this,
and they dig it up out of the ice.

212
00:40:59,748 --> 00:41:02,208
Yes, Garry, they dig it up. They cart it back.

213
00:41:02,293 --> 00:41:05,628
It gets thawed out, wakes up,
not in the best of moods.

00:41:08,382 --> 00:41:11,885
been tossing his dirty drawers
in the kitchen trash can, huh?

216
00:41:12,303 --> 00:41:15,555
From now on
I want my kitchen clean, germfree.

217
00:41:15,848 --> 00:41:18,933
Now how's this motherfucker wake up
after thousands of years in the ice?

218
00:41:19,018 --> 00:41:21,644
- And how could it look like a dog?
- I don't know how.

'Cause it's from outer space.

out of the lab into the storeroom.

Stash him in here and lock him up.

- I'm tired of talking, Fuchs.

- Mac, it's important.
- What is it?

232
00:44:27,498 --> 00:44:29,666
- Outside.
- It's 40 below outside.

00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:31,918

There's something wrong with Blair.

239
00:45:49,496 --> 00:45:52,749
He's locked himself in his room,
and he won't answer the door.

240
00:45:52,833 --> 00:45:54,834
So I took one of his notebooks from the lab.

(BLAIR GRUNTING)

317
00:54:22,467 --> 00:54:24,093
Good shot, MacReady.

318
00:54:24,177 --> 00:54:25,594
- Excuse me.
- Okay.

319
00:54:25,679 --> 00:54:27,805
- All right, bring him up.
- Yeah.

320
00:54:48,034 --> 00:54:49,535
Come on, Blair.

321
00:54:55,542 --> 00:54:57,126
What about your shack?

322
00:54:57,210 --> 00:55:00,546
I don't want him in my shack.
We'll lock him in the toolshed.

323
00:55:04,759 --> 00:55:08,345
- BLAIR: Why am I in here?
- For your own protection, Blair.

324
00:55:23,445 --> 00:55:25,070
How you doing, old boy?

325
00:55:29,117 --> 00:55:31,160
I don't know who to trust.

326
00:55:32,912 --> 00:55:35,080
I know what you mean, Blair.

327
00:55:36,666 --> 00:55:39,585
Trust's a tough thing to come by these days.

328
00:55:41,171 --> 00:55:44,089
Tell you what.
Why don't you just trust in the Lord?

329
00:55:46,968 --> 00:55:49,928
- Watch Clark.
- What?

330
00:55:51,431 --> 00:55:54,266
I said, watch Clark.

331
00:55:55,101 --> 00:55:57,603
And watch him close. Do you hear me?

332
00:56:16,039 --> 00:56:18,040
And now the radio's gone.

333
00:56:18,291 --> 00:56:21,210
- And so are the choppers.
- We're completely cut off.

334
00:56:21,294 --> 00:56:24,880
All we can do now is hole up
'til spring, wait for the rescue team.

335
00:56:24,964 --> 00:56:26,632
No, we don't wait.

336
00:56:27,217 --> 00:56:29,635
Somebody in this camp
ain't what he appears to be.

337
00:56:29,719 --> 00:56:33,180
Right now that may be one or two of us.
By spring, it could be all of us.

338
00:56:33,264 --> 00:56:35,474
So how do we know who's human?

339
00:56:36,518 --> 00:56:39,478
If I was an imitation, a perfect imitation,

340
00:56:39,979 --> 00:56:42,648
how would you know if it was really me?

341
00:56:48,613 --> 00:56:50,406
Is there some kind of test, Doc?

342
00:56:50,490 --> 00:56:54,660
Well, yeah, possibly.
I've been thinking about a blood serum test.

343
00:56:54,828 --> 00:56:56,245
CHILDS: What's that?

344
00:56:56,454 --> 00:57:01,333
We could take a sample of each person's
blood, mix it with uncontaminated blood.

345
00:57:01,709 --> 00:57:04,711
I suppose if there's a reaction,
we'd know who isn't human.

346
00:57:04,796 --> 00:57:08,424
- We've got whole blood in storage.
- Start working on it.

347
00:57:09,008 --> 00:57:10,801
Keep an eye on Clark.

348
00:57:11,261 --> 00:57:13,262
He was close to that dog.

349
00:57:14,013 --> 00:57:15,639
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

350
00:57:20,603 --> 00:57:25,023
Mac, we need Blair's help.
He's the only one who knows this organism.

351
00:57:25,108 --> 00:57:26,442
He's too far gone.

352
00:57:26,526 --> 00:57:29,778
But get the rest of his notebooks.
Start going through them.

353
00:57:42,125 --> 00:57:44,668
Garry! Hey, you guys, come here!

354
00:57:46,963 --> 00:57:49,965
- What?
- Somebody got to the blood.

355
00:57:50,049 --> 00:57:51,175
What?

356
00:57:51,759 --> 00:57:53,886
- Where's Clark?
- Right here.

357
00:57:54,387 --> 00:57:58,056
- Wait a minute. Was this broken into?
- The lock is undamaged.

358
00:57:58,391 --> 00:58:00,726
Somebody opened it, closed it,
then locked it.

359
00:58:00,810 --> 00:58:01,852
Great.

360
00:58:01,936 --> 00:58:03,854
Who's got access to it?

361
00:58:08,568 --> 00:58:10,569
I guess I'm the only one.

362
00:58:10,904 --> 00:58:12,779
And I got the only key.

363
00:58:16,618 --> 00:58:20,162
- Would that test have worked, Doc?
- I think so, yes.

364
00:58:20,246 --> 00:58:22,164
NORRIS: Somebody else
sure as hell thought so.

365
00:58:22,248 --> 00:58:25,250
Well, who else could've used that key?

366
00:58:25,710 --> 00:58:29,129
Nobody! I just give it to Copper
whenever he needs it.

367
00:58:29,589 --> 00:58:31,965
Could anybody have gotten it from you,
Doc?

368
00:58:32,050 --> 00:58:36,053
I don't see how. As soon as I'm finished,
I return it right away.

369
00:58:37,597 --> 00:58:38,764
Great.

370
00:58:40,308 --> 00:58:44,144
FUCHS: When was the last time you used it?
DOC: Day or so ago.

371
00:58:45,897 --> 00:58:48,524
I suppose somebody could have
lifted it off me...

372
00:58:48,608 --> 00:58:49,775
Oh, come on!

373
00:58:49,859 --> 00:58:52,194
That key ring of yours
is always hooked to your belt.

Accusing everybody...

MacREADY: Stop it! It ain't worth it!

377
00:58:57,867 --> 00:58:59,535
Copper's the only one
who's got any business with it.

378
00:58:59,619 --> 00:59:02,204
Wait a minute!
You've been in here on several occasions.

379
00:59:02,288 --> 00:59:03,705
Doc thought of the test.

380
00:59:03,790 --> 00:59:06,166
CHILDS: So what?
Is that supposed to clear him?

Put that down!

- No.
- I'll put this right through your head.

00:59:29,357 --> 00:59:31,191
You guys gonna listen to Garry?

387
00:59:31,276 --> 00:59:34,486
You gonna let him give the orders?
He could be one of those Things.

Windows.

389
00:59:37,073 --> 00:59:39,950
Wait a minute. Just take it easy.
Put the gun down.

390
00:59:40,326 --> 00:59:42,703
Put it down.
You don't want to hurt anybody.

391
00:59:42,787 --> 00:59:43,787
Right.

392
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:45,539
GARRY: On the floor.

393
01:00:00,305 --> 01:00:01,972
It's on the floor.

394
01:00:08,730 --> 01:00:10,772
I don't know about Copper,

395
01:00:11,983 --> 01:00:15,360
but I give you my word,
I did not go near that blood.

396
01:00:22,952 --> 01:00:25,954
But I guess you'll all feel a little easier

397
01:00:27,999 --> 01:00:30,292
if somebody else was in charge.

398
01:00:31,711 --> 01:00:34,671
Norris, I can't see anybody objecting to you.

399
01:00:38,009 --> 01:00:40,719
I'm sorry, fellas, but I'm not up to it.

400
01:00:41,304 --> 01:00:43,722
- I'll take it.
- Like hell you will.

401
01:00:44,724 --> 01:00:48,352
It should be somebody
a little more even-tempered, Childs.

402
01:00:58,404 --> 01:00:59,738
MacREADY: All right.

403
01:01:22,929 --> 01:01:24,554
MacREADY: I know I'm human.

404
01:01:28,142 --> 01:01:31,645
And if you were all these Things,
then you'd just attack me right now.

405
01:01:31,729 --> 01:01:34,022
So some of you are still human.

406
01:01:34,982 --> 01:01:39,653
This Thing doesn't want to show itself.
It wants to hide inside an imitation.

407
01:01:40,988 --> 01:01:42,989
It'll fight if it has to.

408
01:01:43,074 --> 01:01:45,617
But it's vulnerable out in the open.

409
01:01:46,828 --> 01:01:48,620
If it takes us over,

410
01:01:50,289 --> 01:01:52,416
then it has no more enemies,

411
01:01:53,459 --> 01:01:55,335
nobody left to kill it.

412
01:01:56,462 --> 01:01:58,130
And then it's won.

413
01:02:01,718 --> 01:02:04,469
There's a storm hitting us in six hours.

414
01:02:04,846 --> 01:02:07,139
We're gonna find out who's who.

415
01:02:07,807 --> 01:02:12,060
All right, Doc, Garry and Clark,
move over there away from the others.

416
01:02:23,823 --> 01:02:26,408
Norris, you and Childs
shoot them up with morphine.

417
01:02:26,492 --> 01:02:28,201
Tie them down in the rec room
and watch them.

418
01:02:28,286 --> 01:02:29,870
Fuchs, you start working
on a new technique.

419
01:02:29,954 --> 01:02:32,497
- I need Doc's help.
- You don't wanna drug me.

420
01:02:32,999 --> 01:02:34,958
Mac, I'm not a prisoner!

421
01:02:56,689 --> 01:02:58,940
Let me do it.
You're gonna break the needle in my arm.

422
01:02:59,025 --> 01:03:01,568
No, Doc, he's doing a real fine job.

423
01:03:10,912 --> 01:03:13,747
I'm gonna hide this tape when I'm finished.

424
01:03:14,040 --> 01:03:18,001
If none of us make it,
at least there'll be some kind of record.

425
01:03:18,377 --> 01:03:21,379
Storm's been hitting us hard now
for 48 hours.

426
01:03:22,632 --> 01:03:24,633
We still have nothing to go on.

427
01:03:36,854 --> 01:03:40,690
One other thing,
I think it rips through your clothes

428
01:03:40,775 --> 01:03:42,692
when it takes you over.

429
01:03:43,444 --> 01:03:47,697
Windows found some shredded long johns,
but the name tag was missing.

430
01:03:48,741 --> 01:03:50,700
They could be anybody's.

431
01:03:52,119 --> 01:03:53,370
Nobody...

432
01:03:56,082 --> 01:03:58,124
Nobody trusts anybody now.

433
01:04:00,002 --> 01:04:02,003
And we're all very tired.

434
01:04:09,262 --> 01:04:11,304
Nobody trusts anybody now.

435
01:04:15,601 --> 01:04:17,853
There's nothing else I can do.

436
01:04:18,521 --> 01:04:19,855
Just wait.

You come up with anything yet?

439
01:04:44,630 --> 01:04:46,298
One or two ideas.

440
01:04:50,303 --> 01:04:52,512
But, MacReady, I've been thinking.

441
01:04:52,597 --> 01:04:56,558
If a small particle of this Thing
is enough to take over an entire organism,

442
01:04:56,642 --> 01:04:58,727
then everyone should prepare
their own meals.

443
01:04:58,811 --> 01:05:01,396
And I suggest we only eat out of cans.

444
01:05:02,648 --> 01:05:04,149
All right.

Anybody see Fuchs?

01:06:21,352 --> 01:06:23,395
Somebody blew out a fuse in the lab.

01:06:23,479 --> 01:06:26,898
Lights were out for an hour.
Anyone of us could've gotten to him.

450
01:06:26,983 --> 01:06:28,858
All right, we gotta find him.

451

Nauls, why don't you come with me
and we'll look outside.

452
01:06:32,113 --> 01:06:34,656
Palmer, you and Windows check the inside.

453
01:06:34,740 --> 01:06:36,866
I ain't going with Windows.

454
01:06:37,910 --> 01:06:40,912
I ain't going with him. I'll go with Childs.

455
01:06:40,997 --> 01:06:43,498
- Hey, fuck you, Palmer!
- I ain't going with you!

456
01:06:43,582 --> 01:06:46,918
- Who says I want you going with me?
- Cut the bullshit!

Any of them move, you fry them.
You hear anything, cut loose on the sirens.

We all meet back here
in 20 minutes regardless.

you're with... real close.

Hey, Blair.

01:07:30,129 --> 01:07:32,255
Blair, have you seen Fuchs?

464
01:07:35,801 --> 01:07:39,637
I don't wanna stay out here anymore.
I wanna come back inside.

01:07:43,184 --> 01:07:45,393
I hear funny things out here.

- Have you come across Fuchs?
- It ain't Fuchs.

It ain't Fuchs.

I'm not gonna harm anybody.
There's nothing wrong with me.

01:25:37,382 --> 01:25:38,799
Let's do it.

631
01:25:52,397 --> 01:25:55,399
CHILDS: Get me out of here! Cut me loose!

632
01:25:55,859 --> 01:25:59,778
Cut me the hell... Come on, get me
out of here! Come on, get me out of here!

633
01:25:59,863 --> 01:26:01,738
Cut me loose, damn it!

634
01:26:19,757 --> 01:26:22,718
I know you gentlemen
have been through a lot,

635
01:26:23,761 --> 01:26:25,888
but when you find the time,

636
01:26:26,764 --> 01:26:31,435
I'd rather not spend the rest
of this winter tied to this fucking couch!

637
01:26:53,833 --> 01:26:55,042
Childs.

638
01:26:55,501 --> 01:26:58,545
We're going out to give Blair the test.
If he tries to make it back here

639
01:26:58,630 --> 01:27:01,131
and we're not with him... burn him.

640
01:27:10,350 --> 01:27:11,350
(WIND HOWLING)

641
01:27:21,527 --> 01:27:23,570
Mac, the door's open!

642
01:27:38,336 --> 01:27:41,838
How'd he get out?
The door was bolted from the outside.

643
01:27:48,638 --> 01:27:49,638
(WOOD CREAKS)

644
01:28:26,718 --> 01:28:27,884
GARRY: Blair?

645
01:28:31,431 --> 01:28:35,767
NAULS: Hey, Blair, you down there?
We got something for ya!

646
01:28:46,821 --> 01:28:49,614
MacREADY: Blair's been busy out here
all by himself.

647
01:28:59,667 --> 01:29:00,917
What is it?

648
01:29:01,586 --> 01:29:03,211
Something he's been making.

649
01:29:03,296 --> 01:29:05,297
It's a ship of some kind.

650
01:29:06,883 --> 01:29:08,759
He stole the parts from the helicopter.

651
01:29:08,843 --> 01:29:11,762
The smart S.O. B. Put it together
piece by piece.

652
01:29:13,514 --> 01:29:15,557
Where was he trying to go?

653
01:29:16,726 --> 01:29:18,393
Anyplace but here.

654
01:29:58,309 --> 01:30:00,644
Hey, you guys, come here. Come here.

655
01:30:07,360 --> 01:30:11,196
I think I saw Childs outside
the main entrance of the camp.

656
01:30:11,322 --> 01:30:13,990
- What's he doing outside?
- I don't know.

657
01:30:25,169 --> 01:30:26,545
Got a flare?

658
01:30:29,382 --> 01:30:32,175
He got back inside and blew the generator.

659
01:30:34,345 --> 01:30:37,222
In six hours,
it'll be a hundred below in here.

660
01:30:37,306 --> 01:30:39,099
Well, that's suicide!

661
01:30:40,017 --> 01:30:43,728
Not for that Thing. It wants to freeze now.

662
01:30:44,939 --> 01:30:46,022
It's got no way out of here.

663
01:30:46,107 --> 01:30:49,568
It just wants to go to sleep in the cold
until the rescue team finds it.

664
01:30:51,279 --> 01:30:53,697
What can we do? What can we do?

665
01:30:55,324 --> 01:30:58,869
Whether we make it or not,
we can't let that Thing freeze again.

666
01:31:00,204 --> 01:31:03,540
Maybe we'll just warm things up
a little around here.

667
01:31:08,588 --> 01:31:11,089
We're not getting out of here alive.

668
01:31:13,134 --> 01:31:14,885
But neither is that Thing.

669
01:32:22,036 --> 01:32:23,286
(GLASS SHATTERING)

670
01:33:04,495 --> 01:33:06,162
Generator room.

671
01:34:13,939 --> 01:34:15,815
The generator's gone.

672
01:34:15,900 --> 01:34:17,734
Any way we can fix it?

673
01:34:20,029 --> 01:34:22,072
It's gone, MacReady.

674
01:34:30,498 --> 01:34:31,831
All right.

675
01:34:32,625 --> 01:34:36,169
We gotta bring this whole place
right down into the ice.

676
01:34:36,504 --> 01:34:39,339
Garry, plant yours in the old storage room.

677
01:34:39,924 --> 01:34:42,133
Nauls, down by the generator.

678
01:35:34,019 --> 01:35:35,270
God!

679
01:35:42,611 --> 01:35:43,611
(MOANING)

680
01:36:45,132 --> 01:36:47,133
How's it coming in there?

681
01:36:48,803 --> 01:36:50,470
I said, how's it...

682
01:38:06,839 --> 01:38:07,839
(GROWLING)

683
01:38:35,868 --> 01:38:37,869
Yeah, fuck you, too!

684
01:40:03,247 --> 01:40:05,331
You the only one who made it?

685
01:40:06,166 --> 01:40:07,792
Not the only one.

686
01:40:10,337 --> 01:40:11,921
Did you kill it?

687
01:40:13,090 --> 01:40:14,966
Where were you, Childs?

688
01:40:16,468 --> 01:40:18,261
Thought I saw Blair.

689
01:40:19,596 --> 01:40:23,725
I went out after him
and got lost in the storm.

690
01:40:34,194 --> 01:40:37,280
Fire's got the temperature up
all over the camp.

691
01:40:39,533 --> 01:40:41,534
Won't last long, though.

692
01:40:42,327 --> 01:40:43,953
Neither will we.

693
01:40:46,123 --> 01:40:47,874
How will we make it?

694
01:40:50,085 --> 01:40:51,794
Maybe we shouldn't.

695
01:40:56,967 --> 01:40:58,551
If you're worried about me...

696
01:40:58,635 --> 01:41:01,471
If we've got any surprises for each other,

697
01:41:03,223 --> 01:41:06,851
I don't think we're in much shape
to do anything about it.

698
01:41:10,689 --> 01:41:14,776
Well... what do we do?

699
01:41:15,986 --> 01:41:17,779
Why don't we just

700
01:41:19,490 --> 01:41:21,657
wait here for a little while?

701
01:41:24,328 --> 01:41:25,953
See what happens.
