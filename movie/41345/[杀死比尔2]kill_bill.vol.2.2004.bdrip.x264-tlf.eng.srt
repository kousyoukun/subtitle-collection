1
00:00:14,967 --> 00:00:17,231
Do you find me sadistic?

2
00:00:19,038 --> 00:00:21,370
You know, Kiddo...

3
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:23,908
...I'd like to believe...

4
00:00:23,976 --> 00:00:27,412
...you're aware enough, even now...

5
00:00:27,479 --> 00:00:31,643
... to know that there's nothing sadistic...

6
00:00:31,717 --> 00:00:33,878
...in my actions.

7
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:38,412
At this moment...

8
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:41,118
...this is me...

9
00:00:41,193 --> 00:00:43,821
...at my most masochistic.

10
00:00:43,896 --> 00:00:46,421
Bill.

11
00:00:46,498 --> 00:00:47,795
It's your ba...

12
00:00:52,905 --> 00:00:54,770
Looked dead, didn't I?

13
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:56,501
Well, I wasn't.

14
00:00:56,575 --> 00:01:00,136
But it wasn't from lack of trying,
I can tell you that.

15
00:01:00,212 --> 00:01:03,409
Actually, Bill's last bullet
put me in a coma -

16
00:01:03,482 --> 00:01:06,815
a coma I was to lie in for four years.

17
00:01:07,553 --> 00:01:11,990
When I woke up, I went on what
the movie advertisements refer to as

18
00:01:12,057 --> 00:01:15,549
"a roaring rampage of revenge."

19
00:01:15,627 --> 00:01:18,653
I roared, and I rampaged,

20
00:01:18,731 --> 00:01:22,292
and I got bloody satisfaction.

21
00:01:22,368 --> 00:01:26,202
I've killed a hell of a lot of people
to get to this point,

22
00:01:26,271 --> 00:01:29,536
but I've only one more.

23
00:01:29,608 --> 00:01:31,667
The last one.

24
00:01:31,744 --> 00:01:35,271
The one I'm driving to right now.

25
00:01:35,347 --> 00:01:38,180
The only one left.

26
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:41,913
And when I arrive at my destination,

27
00:01:41,987 --> 00:01:45,184
I am gonna kill Bill.

28
00:02:10,516 --> 00:02:13,952
The incident that happened
at the Two Pines Wedding Chapel

29
00:02:14,019 --> 00:02:17,182
that put this whole gory story into motion

30
00:02:17,256 --> 00:02:19,884
has since become legend.

31
00:02:19,958 --> 00:02:22,654
"Massacre at Two Pines. "

32
00:02:22,728 --> 00:02:24,719
That's what the newspapers called it.

33
00:02:24,797 --> 00:02:26,628
The local TV news called it,

34
00:02:26,698 --> 00:02:30,691
"The El Paso, Texas
Wedding Chapel Massacre. "

35
00:02:30,769 --> 00:02:33,465
How it happened, who was there,

36
00:02:33,539 --> 00:02:36,474
how many got killed
and who killed them -

37
00:02:36,542 --> 00:02:40,103
changes depending on
who's telling the story.

38
00:02:40,179 --> 00:02:45,617
In actual fact, the massacre didn't
happen during a wedding at all.

39
00:02:45,684 --> 00:02:48,084
It was a wedding rehearsal.

40
00:02:48,153 --> 00:02:50,713
Now, when we come
to the part where I say,

41
00:02:50,789 --> 00:02:55,021
"You may kiss the bride,"
you may kiss the bride.

42
00:02:55,094 --> 00:02:57,426
But don't stick your tongue in her mouth.

43
00:02:59,565 --> 00:03:01,726
This might be funny to your friends,

44
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:04,963
but it would be embarrassing
to your parents.

45
00:03:06,705 --> 00:03:09,731
We'll try to restrain ourselves, Reverend.

46
00:03:11,009 --> 00:03:12,909
Y'all got a song?

47
00:03:16,415 --> 00:03:19,748
How 'bout "Love Me Tender"?
I can play that.

48
00:03:19,818 --> 00:03:21,809
- Sure.
- Yeah.

49
00:03:21,887 --> 00:03:24,219
"Love Me Tender" would be great.

50
00:03:24,289 --> 00:03:27,383
Rufus - he's the man.

51
00:03:27,459 --> 00:03:30,519
Rufus, who was that
that you used to play for?

52
00:03:30,596 --> 00:03:32,587
Rufus Thomas.

53
00:03:32,664 --> 00:03:35,565
Rufus Thomas.
Rufus Thomas.

54
00:03:35,634 --> 00:03:39,968
I was a Drell. I was a Drifter.
I was a Coaster.

55
00:03:40,038 --> 00:03:43,633
I was part of the Gang.
I was a Barkay.

56
00:03:43,709 --> 00:03:47,907
If they come through Texas,
I done played with 'em.

57
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:51,438
Rufus - he's the man.

58
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:56,715
- Have I forgotten anything?
- Um...

59
00:03:56,788 --> 00:04:00,280
Oh yes, you forgot, uh,
the seating arrangements.

60
00:04:00,359 --> 00:04:03,021
- Thank you, Mother.
- Yes.

61
00:04:03,095 --> 00:04:05,325
Now, the way we normally do this -

62
00:04:05,397 --> 00:04:09,493
we have the bride's side,
and then we have the groom's side.

63
00:04:09,568 --> 00:04:12,799
But since the bride
ain't got nobody comin',

64
00:04:12,871 --> 00:04:16,807
and the groom's got
far too many people comin'...

65
00:04:16,875 --> 00:04:20,140
Well, yeah, they're comin'
all the way from Oklahoma.

66
00:04:21,613 --> 00:04:23,080
Right...

67
00:04:23,148 --> 00:04:26,140
Well, I don't see no problem with...

68
00:04:26,218 --> 00:04:29,483
...the groom's side
sharing the bride's side.

69
00:04:29,555 --> 00:04:32,615
- Do you, Mother?
- I don't have a problem with that.

70
00:04:32,691 --> 00:04:34,420
But, uh...

71
00:04:34,493 --> 00:04:38,725
Honey, you know, it would be good
if you had somebody come.

72
00:04:38,797 --> 00:04:40,958
You know, as a sign of good faith?

73
00:04:42,834 --> 00:04:44,961
Well, I don't have anybody...

74
00:04:45,037 --> 00:04:48,973
...except for Tommy and my friends.

75
00:04:49,041 --> 00:04:53,478
- You have no family?
- Well, I'm workin' on changing that.

76
00:04:53,545 --> 00:04:58,811
Mrs. Harmony, we're all the family
this little angel's ever gonna need.

77
00:04:59,618 --> 00:05:03,577
I'm not feeling very well,
and this bitch is starting to piss me off.

78
00:05:03,655 --> 00:05:07,056
So while y'all blather on,
I'm gonna go outside and get some air.

79
00:05:07,125 --> 00:05:10,253
OK. Um, uh, Reverend, sorry, uh...

80
00:05:10,329 --> 00:05:13,999
- She's gonna go out and get some air.
- Yeah. Given her delicate condition...

81
00:05:14,032 --> 00:05:16,694
She just needs a few minutes
to get it together. She'll be OK.

82
00:05:16,768 --> 00:05:18,202
Right...

83
00:06:36,315 --> 00:06:37,646
Hello, Kiddo.

84
00:06:43,021 --> 00:06:47,515
- How did you find me?
- I'm the man.

85
00:06:51,396 --> 00:06:54,331
What are you doin' here?

86
00:06:54,399 --> 00:06:56,924
What am I doin'?

87
00:06:58,270 --> 00:07:00,363
Well...

88
00:07:00,439 --> 00:07:03,772
...moment ago I was playin' my flute.

89
00:07:09,715 --> 00:07:12,809
At this moment...

90
00:07:12,884 --> 00:07:17,378
...I'm lookin' at the most beautiful bride
these old eyes have ever seen.

91
00:07:19,291 --> 00:07:22,818
- Why are you here?
- Last look.

92
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:29,227
- Are you gonna be nice?
- I've never been nice in my whole life.

93
00:07:31,203 --> 00:07:34,536
But I'll do my best to be sweet.

94
00:07:35,006 --> 00:07:36,803
Hmm.

95
00:07:36,875 --> 00:07:39,309
I always told you...

96
00:07:39,378 --> 00:07:42,711
...your sweet side is you best side.

97
00:07:42,781 --> 00:07:47,275
I guess that's why you're
the only one who's ever seen it.

98
00:07:49,688 --> 00:07:53,021
- So you got a bun in the oven.
- Hmm.

99
00:07:55,394 --> 00:07:58,557
- I'm knocked up.
- Jeez, Louise.

100
00:07:59,965 --> 00:08:05,232
That young man of yours sure doesn't
believe in wasting time, does he?

101
00:08:05,303 --> 00:08:07,863
Have you seen Tommy?

102
00:08:10,075 --> 00:08:13,203
- Big guy in the tux?
- Yes.

103
00:08:13,278 --> 00:08:15,405
Then I saw him.

104
00:08:16,615 --> 00:08:18,674
I like his hair.

105
00:08:20,018 --> 00:08:22,384
You promised you'd be nice.

106
00:08:24,322 --> 00:08:28,281
No, I said I'd do my best.
That's hardly a promise.

107
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:31,358
But you're right.

108
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:34,524
What does your young man
do for a living?

109
00:08:36,334 --> 00:08:39,269
He owns a used record store
here in El Paso.

110
00:08:39,337 --> 00:08:44,036
- Ah. Music lover, eh?
- He's fond of music.

111
00:08:45,177 --> 00:08:47,372
Aren't we all?

112
00:08:51,016 --> 00:08:54,816
And what are you doing
for a J-O-B these days?

113
00:08:56,388 --> 00:08:59,448
I work in the record store.

114
00:08:59,524 --> 00:09:02,982
Aso.

115
00:09:03,061 --> 00:09:06,121
It all suddenly seems so clear.

116
00:09:08,567 --> 00:09:12,970
- Do you like it?
- Yeah. I like it a lot, smartass.

117
00:09:14,139 --> 00:09:16,767
I get to listen to music all day...

118
00:09:16,842 --> 00:09:20,835
...talk about music all day.
It's really cool.

119
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:25,343
It's gonna be a great environment
for my little girl to grow up in.

120
00:09:28,186 --> 00:09:37,759
As opposed to jetting around the world,
killing human beings,

121
00:09:32,958 --> 00:09:37,759
and being paid vast sums of money?

122
00:09:37,829 --> 00:09:39,160
Precisely.

123
00:09:39,231 --> 00:09:42,223
Well, my old friend...

124
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:44,666
...to each his own.

125
00:09:44,736 --> 00:09:49,298
However, all cockblockery aside...

126
00:09:49,374 --> 00:09:52,832
I am looking forward
to meeting your young man.

127
00:09:52,911 --> 00:09:58,178
I happen to be, more or less,
particular whom my gal marries.

128
00:10:00,919 --> 00:10:04,480
- You want to come to the wedding?
- Only if I can sit on the bride's side.

129
00:10:06,224 --> 00:10:08,658
You'll find it a bit lonely on my side.

130
00:10:08,727 --> 00:10:12,185
Your side always was a bit lonely.

131
00:10:12,931 --> 00:10:15,297
But I wouldn't sit anywhere else.

132
00:10:17,669 --> 00:10:19,694
You know...

133
00:10:19,771 --> 00:10:22,239
...I had the loveliest dream about you...

134
00:10:22,307 --> 00:10:24,741
Oh, here's Tommy!
Call me Arlene.

135
00:10:25,544 --> 00:10:27,102
- You must be Tommy!
- Uh-huh.

136
00:10:27,178 --> 00:10:29,612
Arlene's told me so much about you.

137
00:10:29,681 --> 00:10:32,479
- Honey, you OK?
- Oh, I'm fine.

138
00:10:32,551 --> 00:10:35,645
Tommy, I'd like you to meet my father.

139
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:38,450
Oh, my God!

140
00:10:38,523 --> 00:10:40,286
Oh, my God, this is great!

141
00:10:40,358 --> 00:10:43,156
I'm so glad to meet you, sir... uh, Dad.

142
00:10:43,228 --> 00:10:45,526
The name's Bill.

143
00:10:45,597 --> 00:10:47,929
Well, it's great to meet you... Bill.

144
00:10:47,999 --> 00:10:51,196
- Arlene told me you couldn't make it.
- Surprise.

145
00:10:51,269 --> 00:10:54,534
That's my pop for ya.
Always full of surprises.

146
00:10:54,606 --> 00:10:58,007
Well, in the surprise department...

147
00:10:58,076 --> 00:11:01,512
...the apple doesn't fall far from the tree.

148
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:03,741
- When did you get in?
- Just now.

149
00:11:03,815 --> 00:11:06,943
- Did you come straight from Australia?
- Of course.

150
00:11:07,018 --> 00:11:10,818
Daddy, I told Tommy that you were
in Perth mining for silver, and...

151
00:11:10,889 --> 00:11:12,948
...no one could reach you.

152
00:11:13,024 --> 00:11:16,289
Lucky for us all, that's not the case.

153
00:11:16,361 --> 00:11:18,454
So...

154
00:11:18,530 --> 00:11:22,296
What's this all about?
I've heard of wedding rehearsals,

155
00:11:22,367 --> 00:11:26,599
but I don't believe I've ever heard of
a wedding dress rehearsal before.

156
00:11:26,671 --> 00:11:28,002
We thought,

157
00:11:28,073 --> 00:11:31,270
"Why pay so much money for a dress
you're only gonna wear once?"

158
00:11:31,343 --> 00:11:34,335
Especially when Arlene looks
so goddamn beautiful in it.

159
00:11:34,412 --> 00:11:38,143
So, I think we're gonna try to get
all the mileage we can out of it.

160
00:11:39,551 --> 00:11:45,947
Isn't it supposed to be bad luck
for the groom to see the bride

161
00:11:42,921 --> 00:11:45,947
in her wedding dress
before the ceremony?

162
00:11:46,725 --> 00:11:50,320
Well, I guess I just believe
in living dangerously.

163
00:11:52,163 --> 00:11:54,290
I know just what you mean.

164
00:11:54,366 --> 00:11:57,563
Son.
Some of us have places to be.

165
00:11:57,636 --> 00:11:59,297
Sure do.

166
00:11:59,371 --> 00:12:03,808
Look, we got to go through this one
more time. So, why don't you have a s...

167
00:12:03,875 --> 00:12:07,868
Oh, my God. What am I thinking?
You should give her away!

168
00:12:07,946 --> 00:12:11,677
Tommy, that's not exactly
Daddy's cup of tea.

169
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:14,218
I think Father would be
much more comfortable

170
00:12:14,285 --> 00:12:17,277
- sitting with the rest of the guests.
- Hmm. Really?

171
00:12:17,355 --> 00:12:19,323
That's asking a lot.

172
00:12:20,925 --> 00:12:23,621
Oh. OK.
Well, forget it.

173
00:12:23,695 --> 00:12:26,459
But how about we go out
to dinner tonight to celebrate?

174
00:12:26,531 --> 00:12:29,261
Only on the condition that
I pay for everything.

175
00:12:29,334 --> 00:12:31,928
Deal. We got to do this now.

176
00:12:32,003 --> 00:12:35,996
- Can I watch?
- Absolutely. Have a seat.

177
00:12:36,074 --> 00:12:39,043
- Which is the bride's side?
- Right over here.

178
00:12:42,747 --> 00:12:44,738
Mother, here we go!

179
00:12:46,418 --> 00:12:49,478
Now son, about them vows...

180
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:58,224
Bill...

181
00:12:58,296 --> 00:13:02,858
- I just want...
- You don't owe me a damn thing.

182
00:13:02,934 --> 00:13:05,494
If he's the man you want...

183
00:13:05,570 --> 00:13:08,630
...then go stand by him.

184
00:13:32,063 --> 00:13:35,965
- Do I look pretty?
- Oh, yes.

185
00:13:46,811 --> 00:13:49,109
Thank you.

186
00:14:23,648 --> 00:14:25,172
What the hell?

187
00:14:26,651 --> 00:14:28,619
No! Bill!

188
00:15:06,724 --> 00:15:12,788
You tellin' me she cut her way through
88 bodyguards before she got to O-Ren?

189
00:15:14,032 --> 00:15:16,091
Nah, there wasn't really 88 of 'em.

190
00:15:16,167 --> 00:15:18,931
They just called themselves
"The Crazy 88"

191
00:15:19,003 --> 00:15:21,164
- How come?
- I don't know.

192
00:15:21,239 --> 00:15:24,402
I guess they thought it sounded cool.

193
00:15:24,475 --> 00:15:28,104
Anyhow, they all fell
under her Hanzo sword.

194
00:15:28,179 --> 00:15:32,172
- She got a Hanzo sword?
- He made one for her.

195
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:35,708
Didn't he swear a blood oath
to never make another sword?

196
00:15:36,154 --> 00:15:39,351
It would appear he has broken it.

197
00:15:41,693 --> 00:15:45,254
Them Japs sure know how
to hold a grudge, don't they?

198
00:15:47,832 --> 00:15:49,390
Or maybe...

199
00:15:49,667 --> 00:15:52,864
...you just tend
to bring that out in people.

200
00:15:52,937 --> 00:15:57,636
I know this is a ridiculous question
before I ask it,

201
00:15:57,709 --> 00:16:02,373
but you haven't, by any chance,
kept up with your... swordplay?

202
00:16:04,849 --> 00:16:06,908
I, um...

203
00:16:06,985 --> 00:16:10,512
I pawned that years ago.

204
00:16:10,588 --> 00:16:13,921
You hocked a Hattori Hanzo sword?

205
00:16:14,826 --> 00:16:16,054
Yep.

206
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:18,118
It was priceless.

207
00:16:22,767 --> 00:16:27,136
Well, not in El Paso, it ain't.

208
00:16:27,205 --> 00:16:30,197
In El Paso, I got me $250 for it.

209
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:35,539
I'm a bouncer in a titty bar, Bill.

210
00:16:37,916 --> 00:16:43,649
If she wants to fight with me, all she's
got to do is come down to the club

211
00:16:40,885 --> 00:16:43,649
and start some shit,
and we'll be in a fight.

212
00:16:45,423 --> 00:16:50,190
I know we haven't spoken in some time,

213
00:16:50,261 --> 00:16:54,061
and the last time we spoke
wasn't the most pleasant,

214
00:16:54,132 --> 00:16:58,569
but you've got to get over
being mad at me,

215
00:16:58,636 --> 00:17:00,831
and start becoming afraid of (bleep),

216
00:17:00,905 --> 00:17:04,636
because she is coming,
and she's coming to kill you.

217
00:17:05,877 --> 00:17:10,007
And unless you accept my assistance,
I have no doubt she will succeed.

218
00:17:19,324 --> 00:17:23,920
I don't dodge guilt, and I don't Jew
out of paying my comeuppance.

219
00:17:26,164 --> 00:17:29,531
Can't we just... forget the past?

220
00:17:32,370 --> 00:17:34,429
That woman...

221
00:17:34,505 --> 00:17:37,702
...deserves her revenge.

222
00:17:41,579 --> 00:17:43,638
And...

223
00:17:43,715 --> 00:17:46,513
...we deserve to die.

224
00:17:50,788 --> 00:17:53,416
But then again...

225
00:17:53,491 --> 00:17:55,550
...so does she.

226
00:17:58,997 --> 00:18:01,659
So I guess...

227
00:18:01,733 --> 00:18:04,133
...we'll just see.

228
00:18:05,103 --> 00:18:08,300
Won't we?

229
00:18:43,741 --> 00:18:45,504
Late again.

230
00:18:45,576 --> 00:18:48,807
Budd, can't you tell time?

231
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,677
There ain't nobody in here, man.

232
00:18:50,748 --> 00:18:53,080
- Is that Budd?
- Yeah.

233
00:18:53,151 --> 00:18:56,143
Tell him to get
his fucking ass back here!

234
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:58,085
OK.

235
00:18:58,156 --> 00:19:02,490
Budd, Larry'd like a word with ya.

236
00:19:06,397 --> 00:19:08,888
Take a hit.
Be somebody, baby.

237
00:19:18,576 --> 00:19:20,635
You looking for me?

238
00:19:26,484 --> 00:19:30,181
I don't know what car wash
you worked before you came here

239
00:19:30,254 --> 00:19:33,553
that let you stroll in 20 minutes late,
but it wasn't owned by me

240
00:19:33,624 --> 00:19:36,286
- and I own a fuckin' car wash.
- Do you want me to leave?

241
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:39,523
No, I don't want you to leave.
I want you to sit and wait.

242
00:19:39,597 --> 00:19:41,792
Larry...

243
00:19:41,866 --> 00:19:44,801
...there ain't nobody out there, so...

244
00:19:44,869 --> 00:19:50,330
"There's nobody
out there, Larry."

245
00:19:50,408 --> 00:19:52,672
What's your point?

246
00:19:52,743 --> 00:19:57,339
- That you're not needed here?
- My point is...

247
00:19:57,415 --> 00:20:02,045
...I'm the bouncer, and there
ain't nobody out there to bounce.

248
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:05,351
You saying that the reason...

249
00:20:05,423 --> 00:20:13,821
...that you're not doing the job that I'm...

250
00:20:09,327 --> 00:20:13,821
...paying you to do is that
you don't have a job to do?

251
00:20:16,134 --> 00:20:18,432
- No...
- Is that what you're saying?

252
00:20:18,503 --> 00:20:20,437
What are you trying
to convince me of, exactly?

253
00:20:20,505 --> 00:20:24,464
That you're as useless
as an asshole right here?

254
00:20:24,542 --> 00:20:26,874
Well, guess what, buddy?

255
00:20:26,944 --> 00:20:32,143
I think... you just fucking convinced me.

256
00:20:32,216 --> 00:20:34,377
Let's go to the calendar.

257
00:20:34,452 --> 00:20:36,716
It's calendar time.

258
00:20:36,787 --> 00:20:39,312
Calendar time for Buddy.

259
00:20:39,390 --> 00:20:42,757
- OK. You working tomorrow?
- Yeah.

260
00:20:42,827 --> 00:20:46,923
Mm. No, you're n... You don't even know
what fucking day you work.

261
00:20:46,998 --> 00:20:48,989
Here. You're not working tomorrow.

262
00:20:49,066 --> 00:20:52,297
You're working Wednesday.
Here you are. There you go.

263
00:20:52,370 --> 00:20:54,429
- Workin' Thursday?
- Yeah.

264
00:20:54,505 --> 00:20:58,805
I don't think so.
Friday.

265
00:20:58,876 --> 00:21:00,935
I d... There's your name.

266
00:21:01,012 --> 00:21:03,981
- If you say so.
- There used to be your name. OK?

267
00:21:04,048 --> 00:21:06,881
- Saturday. There used to be your name.
- Oh.

268
00:21:06,951 --> 00:21:08,976
Uh, Monday...

269
00:21:09,053 --> 00:21:10,543
Here. How about that?

270
00:21:10,621 --> 00:21:15,388
Fuckin' with your cash is the only thing
you kids seem to understand. OK?

271
00:21:16,894 --> 00:21:19,089
Now, I want you to go home till I call you.

272
00:21:19,163 --> 00:21:21,529
Till I call you.

273
00:21:21,599 --> 00:21:25,501
Before you leave, talk to Rocket.
She's got a job for you to do.

274
00:21:27,104 --> 00:21:29,971
And...

275
00:21:30,041 --> 00:21:32,771
...the hat.

276
00:21:32,843 --> 00:21:34,743
That fuckin' hat.

277
00:21:35,846 --> 00:21:38,644
That fucking...

278
00:21:38,716 --> 00:21:41,651
How many times have I told you,

279
00:21:41,719 --> 00:21:45,712
don't wear that fucking hat here?
How many?

280
00:21:50,261 --> 00:21:51,728
Customers wear hats.

281
00:21:51,796 --> 00:21:54,458
Well, I'm not the boss of the customers.

282
00:21:54,532 --> 00:21:58,491
I'm the boss of you.
And I'm telling you...

283
00:21:58,569 --> 00:22:03,506
...that I want you to keep
that shit-kicker hat at home.

284
00:22:37,575 --> 00:22:41,136
Yeah. Budd, honey, uh,
the toilet is at it again.

285
00:22:41,212 --> 00:22:44,238
There's shitty water all over the floor.

286
00:22:44,315 --> 00:22:48,115
OK... Rocket.

287
00:22:49,987 --> 00:22:52,785
- I'll clean it up.
- Mm-hmm.

Ugh! Ugh.

317
00:29:04,228 --> 00:29:05,786
Bill.

318
00:29:05,863 --> 00:29:09,026
Wrong brother, ya hateful bitch.

319
00:29:09,099 --> 00:29:11,192
- Budd.
- Bingo.

320
00:29:12,803 --> 00:29:15,135
And to what do I owe
this dubious pleasure?

321
00:29:15,205 --> 00:29:20,199
I just caught me the cowgirl
ain't never been caught.

322
00:29:21,912 --> 00:29:25,678
- Did you kill her?
- Well, not yet, I ain't.

323
00:29:26,383 --> 00:29:28,749
I shot her full of rock salt.

324
00:29:28,819 --> 00:29:33,483
She's so gentle right now, I could
perform her coup de grace with a rock.

325
00:29:34,658 --> 00:29:36,888
Anywho...

326
00:29:39,963 --> 00:29:43,262
Guess what I'm holdin'
in my hand right now?

327
00:29:43,333 --> 00:29:44,425
What?

328
00:29:44,501 --> 00:29:48,494
A brand spankin' new
Hattori Hanzo sword.

329
00:29:50,074 --> 00:29:53,441
And I'm here to tell ya, Elle,

330
00:29:53,510 --> 00:29:56,911
-...that's what I call sharp.
- How much?

331
00:29:56,980 --> 00:30:01,576
Oh, that's hard to say,
bein' that it's... priceless and all.

332
00:30:01,652 --> 00:30:04,416
What's the terms?

333
00:30:04,488 --> 00:30:07,355
You get your bony ass down here
first thing in the morning...

334
00:30:08,659 --> 00:30:12,823
...with a million dollars in folding cash...

335
00:30:12,896 --> 00:30:18,198
...and I'll give you the greatest sword
ever made by a man.

336
00:30:22,239 --> 00:30:24,104
Now, how do you like the sound of that?

337
00:30:24,174 --> 00:30:26,005
Sounds like we got a deal.

338
00:30:26,076 --> 00:30:28,943
- One condition.
- What?

339
00:30:29,012 --> 00:30:32,607
She must suffer to her last breath.

340
00:30:32,683 --> 00:30:35,311
Well...

341
00:30:35,385 --> 00:30:38,354
That, Elle darlin'...

342
00:30:38,422 --> 00:30:41,255
...I can pretty much
damn well guarantee.

343
00:30:42,326 --> 00:30:46,092
Then I'll see you
in the mornin', millionaire.

344
00:30:46,163 --> 00:30:48,461
All right.

345
00:31:49,126 --> 00:31:51,390
Wakey, wakey.

346
00:31:51,461 --> 00:31:52,826
Eggs and bakey.

347
00:32:28,232 --> 00:32:30,632
I'm done!

348
00:32:30,701 --> 00:32:32,965
Get me outta this hole!

349
00:32:36,306 --> 00:32:38,433
Good.

350
00:32:47,451 --> 00:32:49,578
Whew.

351
00:33:10,574 --> 00:33:12,439
Whoa, look at those eyes.

352
00:33:12,509 --> 00:33:15,945
This bitch is furious.

353
00:33:16,013 --> 00:33:19,608
What did I tell ya?

354
00:33:19,683 --> 00:33:22,846
Is she the cutest little
blond pussy you ever saw?

355
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:27,118
Or... is she the cutest little
blond pussy you ever saw?

356
00:33:27,190 --> 00:33:29,852
I seen better.

357
00:33:34,564 --> 00:33:35,963
You got anything to say?

358
00:33:39,036 --> 00:33:42,233
White women call this
"the silent treatment."

359
00:33:42,306 --> 00:33:45,207
And we let 'em think we don't like it.

360
00:33:50,047 --> 00:33:52,311
You grab the feet, I'll get the head.

361
00:34:00,023 --> 00:34:03,789
Hey. Hey. Hey!

362
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:06,351
Wiggle worm, you see this?

363
00:34:07,798 --> 00:34:10,460
You see it, don't ya?

364
00:34:12,035 --> 00:34:13,502
That's a can of Mace.

365
00:34:13,570 --> 00:34:16,471
Mm-hmm. No.

366
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:19,941
You're goin' underneath
the ground tonight.

367
00:34:20,010 --> 00:34:23,605
And... that's all there is to it.

368
00:34:26,984 --> 00:34:29,350
I wanna bury ya.

369
00:34:31,888 --> 00:34:34,789
I was gonna bury ya...

370
00:34:38,762 --> 00:34:41,788
...with this.

371
00:34:45,469 --> 00:34:48,870
But if you're gonna
act like a horse's ass...

372
00:34:51,074 --> 00:34:56,671
...I'm gonna spray this whole goddamn
can right in your eyeballs!

373
00:34:56,747 --> 00:35:00,183
I'll burn 'em right outta your fuckin' head.

374
00:35:00,984 --> 00:35:03,748
Then you're gonna be blind...

375
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:05,811
...and burnin'...

376
00:35:08,392 --> 00:35:10,053
...and buried alive.

377
00:35:15,766 --> 00:35:17,734
Now, what's it gonna be, sister?

378
00:35:28,779 --> 00:35:31,680
That's a wise decision.

379
00:35:44,127 --> 00:35:47,119
This is for breakin' my brother's heart.

380
00:39:36,259 --> 00:39:38,853
Once upon a time...

381
00:39:38,928 --> 00:39:41,761
...in China...

382
00:39:41,831 --> 00:39:45,699
...some believe around the year...

383
00:39:45,769 --> 00:39:49,261
...one double aught-three,

384
00:39:49,339 --> 00:39:55,505
head priest of the White Lotus Clan,
Pai Mei, was walking down a road...

385
00:39:56,813 --> 00:40:05,114
...contemplating whatever it is

386
00:39:58,948 --> 00:40:05,114
that a man of Pai Mei's
infinite powers would contemplate -

387
00:40:05,188 --> 00:40:08,157
which is another way
of saying, "Who knows?" -

388
00:40:09,592 --> 00:40:12,618
when a Shaolin monk
appeared on the road,

389
00:40:12,696 --> 00:40:15,460
traveling in the opposite direction.

390
00:40:15,532 --> 00:40:19,935
As the monk and the priest
crossed paths...

391
00:40:20,003 --> 00:40:22,130
...Pai Mei...

392
00:40:22,205 --> 00:40:32,772
...in a practically unfathomable
display of generosity,

393
00:40:27,744 --> 00:40:32,772
gave the monk the slightest of nods.

394
00:40:32,849 --> 00:40:34,874
The nod...

395
00:40:34,951 --> 00:40:37,442
...was not returned.

396
00:40:40,523 --> 00:40:46,792
Now, was it the intention
of the Shaolin monk to insult Pai Mei?

397
00:40:46,863 --> 00:40:51,823
Or did he just fail to see
the generous social gesture?

398
00:40:51,901 --> 00:40:56,838
The motives of the monk
remain unknown.

399
00:40:56,906 --> 00:40:58,999
What is known...

400
00:40:59,075 --> 00:41:01,839
...were the consequences.

401
00:41:13,823 --> 00:41:19,989
The next morning, Pai Mei
appeared at the Shaolin temple...

402
00:41:20,063 --> 00:41:23,328
...and demanded
of the temple's head abbot

403
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:28,702
that he offer Pai Mei his neck
to repay the insult.

404
00:41:30,173 --> 00:41:34,542
The abbot, at first,
tried to console Pai Mei.

405
00:41:34,611 --> 00:41:38,513
Only to find Pai Mei was...

406
00:41:38,581 --> 00:41:40,242
...inconsolable.

407
00:41:51,561 --> 00:41:53,995
So began...

408
00:41:54,063 --> 00:42:03,463
...the Massacre of the Shaolin Temple,
and all sixty of the monks inside,

409
00:41:59,936 --> 00:42:03,463
at the fists of the White Lotus.

410
00:42:03,540 --> 00:42:07,340
And... so began the legend...

411
00:42:07,410 --> 00:42:11,813
...of Pai Mei's Five-Point-Palm
Exploding-Heart Technique.

412
00:42:11,881 --> 00:42:16,812
And what, pray tell,
is the Five-Point-Palm

413
00:42:14,184 --> 00:42:16,812
- Exploding-Heart Technique?
- Quite simply,

414
00:42:17,587 --> 00:42:21,956
the deadliest blow in all of martial arts.

415
00:42:23,393 --> 00:42:26,954
He hits you with his fingertips...

416
00:42:27,030 --> 00:42:30,966
...at five different pressure
points on your body...

417
00:42:31,034 --> 00:42:35,061
...and then lets you walk away.

418
00:42:35,138 --> 00:42:38,107
But once you've taken five steps...

419
00:42:38,174 --> 00:42:42,201
...your heart explodes inside your body...

420
00:42:42,278 --> 00:42:45,372
...and you fall to the floor, dead.

421
00:42:46,516 --> 00:42:48,541
- Did he teach you that?
- No.

422
00:42:50,587 --> 00:42:54,853
He teaches no one the Five-Point-Palm
Exploding-Heart Technique.

423
00:42:55,658 --> 00:42:57,990
Now...

424
00:42:58,061 --> 00:43:01,394
...one of the things
I've always liked about you...

425
00:43:01,464 --> 00:43:03,455
...Kiddo...

426
00:43:04,734 --> 00:43:07,897
...is you appear
wise beyond your years.

427
00:43:11,574 --> 00:43:16,204
So, allow me to impart
a word to the wise:

428
00:43:16,279 --> 00:43:17,906
Whatever...

429
00:43:17,981 --> 00:43:21,940
...whatever Pai Mei says, obey.

430
00:43:23,353 --> 00:43:28,484
If you flash him, even for an instant,
a defiant eye, he'll pluck it out.

431
00:43:29,225 --> 00:43:33,787
And if you throw any
American sass his way...

432
00:43:33,863 --> 00:43:37,060
...he'll snap your back and your neck
like they were twigs.

433
00:43:40,503 --> 00:43:43,301
And that will be the story of you.

434
00:44:03,593 --> 00:44:06,153
He'll accept you as his student.

435
00:44:06,229 --> 00:44:08,322
- What happened to you?
- Nothin'.

436
00:44:08,398 --> 00:44:11,561
- Get in a fight?
- Friendly contest.

437
00:44:11,634 --> 00:44:13,067
Why did he accept me?

438
00:44:13,136 --> 00:44:17,402
Because he's a very, very, very old man.

439
00:44:17,473 --> 00:44:20,704
And like all rotten bastards...

440
00:44:20,777 --> 00:44:25,942
...when they become old,
they get lonely.

441
00:44:26,015 --> 00:44:28,984
Which has no effect
on their dispositions,

442
00:44:29,052 --> 00:44:33,785
but it does teach them
the value of company.

443
00:44:33,856 --> 00:44:36,347
Whew. Oh.

444
00:44:36,426 --> 00:44:41,329
Just seein' those
steps again makes me ache.

445
00:44:41,965 --> 00:44:47,234
You're gonna have a lot of fun

446
00:44:43,366 --> 00:44:47,234
carrying buckets of water
up and down that fucker.

447
00:44:51,741 --> 00:44:53,800
When will I see you again?

448
00:44:53,876 --> 00:44:57,368
That's the title of my favorite
soul song of the seventies.

449
00:44:57,447 --> 00:44:59,244
- What?
- Nothin'.

450
00:44:59,315 --> 00:45:01,783
When he tells me you're done.

451
00:45:02,852 --> 00:45:04,547
When do you think that might be?

452
00:45:04,621 --> 00:45:07,556
That, my dearest,
depends entirely on you.

453
00:45:07,624 --> 00:45:11,253
Now remember,
no sarcasm, no backtalk.

454
00:45:11,327 --> 00:45:13,625
At least not for the first year or so.

455
00:45:13,696 --> 00:45:16,893
You're gonna have to let him
warm up to you.

456
00:45:16,966 --> 00:45:20,800
He hates Caucasians,
despises Americans,

457
00:45:20,870 --> 00:45:23,668
and has nothing
but contempt for women.

458
00:45:26,042 --> 00:45:29,443
So in your case...
it might take a little while.

459
00:45:30,446 --> 00:45:33,142
- Adios.

460
00:47:12,482 --> 00:47:13,574
Master...

461
00:47:15,418 --> 00:47:17,113
Your Mandarin is lousy.

462
00:47:18,087 --> 00:47:19,452
It causes my ears discomfort.

463
00:47:19,522 --> 00:47:21,114
You bray like an ass!

464
00:47:21,924 --> 00:47:24,051
You are not to speak unless spoken to.

465
00:47:24,961 --> 00:47:28,556
Is it too much to hope --
you understand Cantonese?

466
00:47:32,301 --> 00:47:33,700
I speak Japanese very well--

467
00:47:33,770 --> 00:47:37,069
I didn't ask if you speak Japanese --

468
00:47:37,140 --> 00:47:39,301
I asked if you understand Cantonese?

469
00:47:40,843 --> 00:47:41,832
A little.

470
00:47:42,512 --> 00:47:47,108
You are here to learn the mysteries
of Kung Fu, not linguistics.

471
00:47:47,517 --> 00:47:49,610
If you can't understand me --

472
00:47:49,685 --> 00:47:51,175
I will communicate with you
like I would a dog.

473
00:47:51,487 --> 00:47:54,979
When I yell, when I point,
when I beat you with my stick!

474
00:48:01,063 --> 00:48:02,928
Bill is your master, is he not?

475
00:48:04,834 --> 00:48:06,324
Yes, he is.

476
00:48:08,671 --> 00:48:12,471
Your master tells me --
you're not entirely unschooled.

477
00:48:13,409 --> 00:48:14,774
What training do you possess?

478
00:48:15,678 --> 00:48:18,272
I am proficient in Tiger-Crane Style,

479
00:48:18,347 --> 00:48:22,340
and I am more than proficient in the
exquisite art of the Samurai sword.

480
00:48:23,719 --> 00:48:26,210
The exquisite art of the Samurai sword.
Don't make me laugh!

481
00:48:26,756 --> 00:48:31,352
Your so-called exquisite art,
is only fit for --

482
00:48:31,694 --> 00:48:33,286
Japanese fat heads!

483
00:48:38,434 --> 00:48:43,565
Your anger amuses me.
Do you believe you are my match?

484
00:48:44,106 --> 00:48:44,697
No.

485
00:48:45,541 --> 00:48:47,509
Are you aware I kill at will?

486
00:48:48,177 --> 00:48:49,235
Yes.

487
00:48:49,745 --> 00:48:51,144
Is it your wish to die?

488
00:48:51,547 --> 00:48:51,911
No.

489
00:48:54,083 --> 00:48:55,851
Then you must be stupid...

490
00:48:55,051 --> 00:48:57,451
Then you must be stupid...so stupid.

491
00:48:57,520 --> 00:49:01,251
Rise, and let me look at your
ridiculous face.

492
00:49:01,757 --> 00:49:02,917
Rise.

493
00:49:07,463 --> 00:49:13,860
So my pathetic friend...
Is there anything that you can do well?

494
00:49:13,936 --> 00:49:15,870
What's the matter?

495
00:49:16,305 --> 00:49:18,239
Cat got your tongue?

496
00:49:19,709 --> 00:49:22,678
-- Oh yes, you speak Japanese.

497
00:49:23,312 --> 00:49:24,745
I despise the Goddamn Japs!

498
00:49:27,783 --> 00:49:29,512
Go to that rack.

499
00:49:37,827 --> 00:49:38,794
Remove the sword.

500
00:50:05,121 --> 00:50:06,918
Let's see how good you really are.

501
00:50:07,790 --> 00:50:09,417
If...

502
00:50:10,092 --> 00:50:11,787
...you land a single blow,

503
00:50:13,529 --> 00:50:15,258
I'll bow down and call you master.

504
00:50:29,512 --> 00:50:31,912
From here you can get
an excellent view of my foot.

505
00:50:37,153 --> 00:50:40,486
Your swordsmanship --
is amateur at best.

506
00:50:54,637 --> 00:50:57,773
Your so-called kung-fu -- is really --
quite pathetic.

507
00:51:02,812 --> 00:51:06,612
I asked you to demonstrate --
what you know -- and you did...

508
00:51:07,316 --> 00:51:08,510
Not a goddamn thing!

509
00:51:09,585 --> 00:51:13,214
Let's see your Tiger Crane --
match my Eagle's Claw.

510
00:52:10,379 --> 00:52:12,347
Like all Yankee women...

511
00:52:12,415 --> 00:52:15,907
...all you can do is order in restaurants
and spend a man's money.

512
00:52:17,053 --> 00:52:18,680
Excruciating -- isn't it?

513
00:52:18,754 --> 00:52:20,016
Yes!

514
00:52:21,590 --> 00:52:22,921
If it was my wish...

515
00:52:23,426 --> 00:52:24,757
...I could chop your arm off.

516
00:52:24,827 --> 00:52:26,089
No, please don't!

517
00:52:27,563 --> 00:52:29,861
It's my arm now. I can do what I please.

518
00:52:30,499 --> 00:52:32,729
If you can stop me -- I suggest you try.

519
00:52:34,970 --> 00:52:35,959
I can't.

520
00:52:37,139 --> 00:52:38,367
Because you're helpless?

521
00:52:39,241 --> 00:52:40,139
Yes.

522
00:52:42,778 --> 00:52:44,871
Have you ever felt this before?

523
00:52:45,281 --> 00:52:46,077
No.

524
00:52:46,449 --> 00:52:49,748
Compared to me -- you're as helpless
as a worm fighting an eagle?

525
00:52:50,753 --> 00:52:51,947
YES!!!

526
00:52:54,156 --> 00:52:54,884
THAT'S THE BEGlNNlNG!

527
00:53:00,663 --> 00:53:03,291
Is it your wish to possess
this kind of power?

528
00:53:06,001 --> 00:53:07,593
Yes!

529
00:53:09,171 --> 00:53:10,999
Your training will begin -- tomorrow.

530
00:53:20,716 --> 00:53:22,081
Since your arm now belongs to me...

531
00:53:22,985 --> 00:53:24,982
...I want it strong.

532
00:53:25,855 --> 00:53:27,254
Can you do that?

533
00:53:28,958 --> 00:53:30,619
I can, but not that close.

534
00:53:30,793 --> 00:53:32,090
Then you can't do it.

535
00:53:33,329 --> 00:53:37,095
What if your enemy --
is three inches in front of you...

536
00:53:38,167 --> 00:53:39,429
...What do you do then...

537
00:53:40,569 --> 00:53:41,661
...Curl into a ball...

538
00:53:43,339 --> 00:53:44,601
...or do you put your FlST through him?

539
00:53:46,175 --> 00:53:46,937
Now begin.

540
00:54:19,175 --> 00:54:20,699
It's the wood that should
fear your hand --

541
00:54:20,776 --> 00:54:23,244
-- not the other way around.

542
00:54:24,046 --> 00:54:28,312
No wonder you can't do it --
you acquiesce to defeat --

543
00:54:28,384 --> 00:54:29,817
-- before you even begin.

544
00:56:18,294 --> 00:56:20,524
If you want to eat like a dog...

545
00:56:21,797 --> 00:56:23,788
You can live and sleep
outside like a dog.

546
00:56:26,302 --> 00:56:28,202
If you want to live and sleep
like a human...

547
00:56:29,805 --> 00:56:31,295
...pick up those sticks.

548
01:00:02,217 --> 01:00:05,846
Come on, you bitch.

549
01:00:46,828 --> 01:00:49,456
OK, Pai Mei.

550
01:00:51,667 --> 01:00:53,999
Here I come.

551
01:03:02,631 --> 01:03:06,761
May I have a glass of water, please?

552
01:05:43,955 --> 01:05:47,391
-Sothat's a Texas funeral?
- Yep.

553
01:05:48,993 --> 01:05:51,291
I have to give it to ya, Budd.

554
01:05:51,362 --> 01:05:54,456
That's a pretty fucked up way to die.

555
01:05:54,532 --> 01:05:56,966
What's the name on the grave
she's buried under?

556
01:05:57,835 --> 01:05:59,632
Paula...

557
01:06:01,205 --> 01:06:03,230
...Schultz.

558
01:06:08,579 --> 01:06:09,978
Can I look at the sword?

559
01:06:10,048 --> 01:06:13,609
That's my money right there
in that red bag, isn't it?

560
01:06:13,685 --> 01:06:16,381
It sure is.

561
01:06:16,454 --> 01:06:18,854
Well then, it's your sword now.

562
01:06:35,142 --> 01:06:38,076
(blender whirring)

563
01:06:38,142 --> 01:06:40,076
What's that you said?

564
01:06:40,144 --> 01:06:42,544
So this is a Hattori Hanzo sword?

565
01:06:42,613 --> 01:06:44,945
That's a Hanzo sword, all right.

566
01:06:45,016 --> 01:06:47,780
Bill tells me you once had
one of these of your own.

567
01:06:49,354 --> 01:06:51,345
Yeah, once.

568
01:06:51,422 --> 01:06:54,186
Yeah? How does this one
compare to that?

569
01:07:03,301 --> 01:07:06,828
If you're gonna compare
a Hanzo sword...

570
01:07:08,439 --> 01:07:12,239
...you compare it
to every other sword ever made -

571
01:07:12,310 --> 01:07:17,213
wasn't made - by Hattori Hanzo.

572
01:07:25,056 --> 01:07:27,991
Here you go.
Wrap your lips around that.

573
01:07:37,602 --> 01:07:40,127
So...

574
01:07:40,204 --> 01:07:42,695
...which "R" are you filled with?

575
01:07:43,474 --> 01:07:45,465
What?

576
01:07:48,046 --> 01:07:50,071
They say...

577
01:07:50,148 --> 01:07:57,852
...the number one killer...

578
01:07:52,417 --> 01:07:54,442
...of old people...

579
01:07:54,519 --> 01:07:57,852
...is retirement.

580
01:07:57,922 --> 01:08:03,918
People got a job to do, they tend to live
a little bit longer so they can do it.

581
01:08:05,530 --> 01:08:07,862
I've always figured that...

582
01:08:07,932 --> 01:08:10,992
...warriors and their enemies...

583
01:08:11,069 --> 01:08:19,368
...share the same relationship.

584
01:08:13,805 --> 01:08:19,368
So now that you're not gonna have
to face your enemy no more

585
01:08:17,241 --> 01:08:19,368
on the battlefield...

586
01:08:20,478 --> 01:08:23,470
...which "R" ya filled with?

587
01:08:25,283 --> 01:08:27,274
Relief...

588
01:08:29,887 --> 01:08:31,650
...or regret?

589
01:08:33,357 --> 01:08:37,726
- A little bit of both.
- Horseshit.

590
01:08:38,963 --> 01:08:41,830
I'm sure you do feel a little bit of both.

591
01:08:42,567 --> 01:08:48,364
But I know damn well that you feel one...

592
01:08:45,736 --> 01:08:48,364
...more than you feel the other.

593
01:08:48,439 --> 01:08:52,569
And the question was:
Which one is it?

594
01:08:54,712 --> 01:08:55,940
Regret.

595
01:08:57,715 --> 01:09:00,149
You know,
you gotta hand it to the ol' girl.

596
01:09:00,218 --> 01:09:05,087
I never saw anybody buffalo Bill
the way she buffaloed Bill.

597
01:09:05,156 --> 01:09:07,249
Bill thought she was so damn smart.

598
01:09:07,325 --> 01:09:09,691
And I tried to tell him...

599
01:09:09,760 --> 01:09:11,955
...she was just smart for a blond.

600
01:09:31,182 --> 01:09:32,945
Thanks a bunch.

601
01:09:45,396 --> 01:09:47,261
All right.

602
01:10:16,961 --> 01:10:19,521
Mmm.

603
01:10:19,597 --> 01:10:21,497
I'm sorry, Budd.

604
01:10:21,566 --> 01:10:24,194
That was rude of me, wasn't it?

605
01:10:24,268 --> 01:10:27,795
Budd, I'd like to introduce my friend,
the black mamba.

606
01:10:27,872 --> 01:10:30,864
Black mamba, this is Budd.

607
01:10:30,942 --> 01:10:33,410
You know, before I picked
that little fella up,

608
01:10:33,477 --> 01:10:35,741
I looked him up on the lnternet.

609
01:10:35,813 --> 01:10:39,010
Fascinating creature, the black mamba.

610
01:10:39,083 --> 01:10:40,448
Listen to this:

611
01:10:45,823 --> 01:10:48,053
"ln Africa, the saying goes,

612
01:10:48,125 --> 01:10:52,323
"'ln the bush, an elephant can kill you,
a leopard can kill you,

613
01:10:52,396 --> 01:10:56,423
"'and a black mamba can kill you.
But only with the mamba,

614
01:10:56,500 --> 01:11:00,937
"and this has been true in Africa
since the dawn of time, is death sure.'

615
01:11:01,005 --> 01:11:06,739
Hence its handle, 'Death lncarnate."'
Pretty cool, huh?

616
01:11:09,247 --> 01:11:13,013
"lts neurotoxic venom is one of
nature's most effective poisons,

617
01:11:13,084 --> 01:11:16,417
.
"acting on the nervous system,
causing paralysis.

618
01:11:16,487 --> 01:11:20,014
"The venom of a black mamba
can kill a human being in four hours

619
01:11:20,091 --> 01:11:22,821
"if, say, bitten on the ankle or the thumb.

620
01:11:22,893 --> 01:11:26,329
"However, a bite to the face or torso

621
01:11:26,397 --> 01:11:30,026
can bring death from paralysis
within 20 minutes."

622
01:11:30,101 --> 01:11:33,332
Now, you should listen to this,
'cause this concerns you.

623
01:11:35,172 --> 01:11:38,005
"The amount of venom that can be
delivered from a single bite

624
01:11:38,075 --> 01:11:41,272
can be gargantuan."

625
01:11:41,345 --> 01:11:43,905
You know, I've always liked
that word, "gargantuan."

626
01:11:43,981 --> 01:11:46,575
I so rarely have an opportunity
to use it in a sentence.

627
01:11:47,885 --> 01:11:50,251
"lf not treated quickly with antivenom,

628
01:11:50,321 --> 01:11:53,154
"ten to 1 5 milligrams
can be fatal to human beings.

629
01:11:53,224 --> 01:11:55,784
"However, the black mamba can deliver

630
01:11:55,860 --> 01:12:00,661
as much as 1 00 to 400 milligrams
of venom from a single bite."

631
01:12:03,868 --> 01:12:06,837
Now...

632
01:12:06,904 --> 01:12:11,432
...in these last agonizing
minutes of life you have left,

633
01:12:11,509 --> 01:12:14,444
Iet me answer that question
you asked earlier more thoroughly.

634
01:12:18,282 --> 01:12:20,876
Right at this moment...

635
01:12:20,951 --> 01:12:24,580
...the biggest "R" I feel is regret.

636
01:12:26,357 --> 01:12:32,159
Regret that maybe
the greatest warrior I have ever met

637
01:12:32,229 --> 01:12:42,304
met her end at the hands
of a bushwhackin', scrub,

638
01:12:38,436 --> 01:12:42,304
alkie, piece of shit like you.

639
01:12:44,275 --> 01:12:46,539
That woman deserved better.

640
01:13:30,654 --> 01:13:31,746
Bill...

641
01:13:33,424 --> 01:13:35,415
...I have some tragic news.

642
01:13:36,627 --> 01:13:39,494
Your brother's dead.

643
01:13:39,563 --> 01:13:41,360
I am so sorry, baby.

644
01:13:42,500 --> 01:13:44,934
She put a black mamba in his camper.

645
01:13:45,970 --> 01:13:47,870
I got her, sweetie.
She's dead.

646
01:13:51,008 --> 01:13:52,873
Let me put it this way:

647
01:13:52,943 --> 01:13:57,277
You ever start feeling sentimental,
go to Barstow, California.

648
01:13:57,348 --> 01:14:01,250
When you get here, walk into a florist
and buy a bunch of flowers.

649
01:14:01,318 --> 01:14:04,219
Then you take those flowers
to Huntington Cemetery

650
01:14:04,288 --> 01:14:08,657
on Fuller and Guadalupe, look for
the headstone marked "Paula Schultz,"

651
01:14:08,726 --> 01:14:10,717
and lay them on the grave.

652
01:14:10,795 --> 01:14:16,734
'Cause you will be standing at the final
resting place of Beatrix Kiddo.

653
01:14:16,801 --> 01:14:19,292
- Marty Kitrosser?
- Here.

654
01:14:19,370 --> 01:14:21,201
- Melanie Harrhouse?
- Here.

655
01:14:21,272 --> 01:14:23,740
- Beatrix Kiddo?
- Here.

656
01:14:23,808 --> 01:14:27,175
Look... I can be there
in about four hours.

657
01:14:27,244 --> 01:14:29,735
Do you want me to come over?

658
01:14:29,814 --> 01:14:33,113
No, no, no, no.
You need me, baby, I'm there.

659
01:14:35,953 --> 01:14:38,751
OK. I'm leaving now.

660
01:14:38,823 --> 01:14:41,986
You go smoke some pot or somethin',
I'll be there soon.

661
01:15:43,454 --> 01:15:45,388
Ugh.

662
01:15:45,456 --> 01:15:46,821
Gross.

663
01:16:58,362 --> 01:17:00,159
Hi-ya!
Hi-ya!

664
01:17:09,974 --> 01:17:14,775
"T o my brother, Budd.
The only man I ever loved. Bill."

665
01:17:26,457 --> 01:17:28,687
What's that?

666
01:17:30,227 --> 01:17:32,661
Budd's Hanzo sword.

667
01:17:32,730 --> 01:17:35,221
He said he pawned it.

668
01:17:35,299 --> 01:17:38,928
Guess that makes him
a liar now, don't it?

669
01:17:42,606 --> 01:17:45,268
- Elle?
- Bea.

670
01:17:46,243 --> 01:17:49,303
Somethin' I've always
been curious about.

671
01:17:49,380 --> 01:17:53,043
Just between us girls...

672
01:17:53,117 --> 01:17:57,520
...what did you say to Pai Mei
to make him snatch out your eye?

673
01:17:57,588 --> 01:18:00,318
Ow!

674
01:18:01,325 --> 01:18:04,522
I called him a miserable old fool.

675
01:18:04,595 --> 01:18:08,691
Ooh. Bad idea.

676
01:18:09,867 --> 01:18:11,528
Know what I did?

677
01:18:12,236 --> 01:18:15,797
I killed that miserable old fool.

678
01:18:17,041 --> 01:18:20,670
How do you like the fish head,
you miserable old fool?

679
01:18:20,744 --> 01:18:23,144
I poisoned his fish heads.

680
01:18:23,213 --> 01:18:26,671
Elle, you treacherous dog.

681
01:18:31,288 --> 01:18:33,586
I - give - you - my - word --

682
01:18:33,657 --> 01:18:35,181
And I told him,

683
01:18:35,259 --> 01:18:39,161
"T o me, the word
of an old fool like you

684
01:18:39,229 --> 01:18:43,290
is worth less than nothing."

685
01:18:48,205 --> 01:18:50,173
That's right.

686
01:18:50,240 --> 01:18:52,208
I killed your master.

687
01:18:52,276 --> 01:18:54,904
And now I'm gonna kill you, too.

688
01:18:54,978 --> 01:18:57,640
With your own sword, no less.

689
01:18:57,715 --> 01:19:04,018
Which, in the very immediate future,
will become my sword.

690
01:19:06,156 --> 01:19:08,215
Bitch...

691
01:19:08,292 --> 01:19:10,886
...you don't have a future.

692
01:20:00,144 --> 01:20:02,476
Fucking bitch!

693
01:20:04,648 --> 01:20:06,878
Fucking bitch!

694
01:20:14,525 --> 01:20:17,756
I'll kill you!
You're fuckin' dead!

695
01:20:20,631 --> 01:20:23,293
You bitch! You bitch!

696
01:20:26,970 --> 01:20:30,098
I'll fucking kill you, you bitch!

697
01:20:32,643 --> 01:20:37,012
Oh, I'll get you!

698
01:20:37,080 --> 01:20:40,015
I'm gonna...

699
01:20:40,083 --> 01:20:43,109
Where are you?
Lemme fuckin' at you!

700
01:20:45,222 --> 01:20:49,022
Where are you?
I'm coming, you fucking bitch!

701
01:20:49,092 --> 01:20:51,959
You're fucking dead!
You're dead!

702
01:20:54,498 --> 01:20:57,296
Oh... shit!

703
01:22:24,655 --> 01:22:26,953
Like most men
who never knew their father,

704
01:22:27,024 --> 01:22:29,788
Bill collected father figures.

705
01:22:29,860 --> 01:22:32,852
The first was Esteban Vihaio.

706
01:22:32,930 --> 01:22:36,991
Esteban was a pimp
and a friend of Bill's mother.

707
01:22:37,067 --> 01:22:41,163
He ran a brothel in Acuna, Mexico
for over 50 years.

708
01:22:41,238 --> 01:22:43,570
His army, the Acuna Boys,

709
01:22:43,640 --> 01:22:48,009
made up of the fatherless offspring
of his whores, ran Acuna.

710
01:22:48,078 --> 01:22:51,070
He ran the Acuna Boys.

711
01:22:52,316 --> 01:22:57,253
Now, at the age of 80, it would be
this retired gentleman of leisure

712
01:22:57,321 --> 01:23:00,347
who could point me in Bill's direction.

713
01:23:02,359 --> 01:23:04,725
Senor Esteban Vihaio?

714
01:23:06,263 --> 01:23:07,628
Yes.

715
01:23:07,698 --> 01:23:09,666
May I join you?

716
01:23:11,735 --> 01:23:14,932
Only on the condition
that you call me Esteban.

717
01:23:15,005 --> 01:23:19,169
- May I join you, Esteban?
- Please.

718
01:23:23,347 --> 01:23:25,406
Americana?

719
01:23:25,482 --> 01:23:27,177
Yes.

720
01:23:27,250 --> 01:23:29,912
I speak a little Spanish, if you prefer.

721
01:23:29,987 --> 01:23:33,548
No, no, no, no.
I prefer English.

722
01:23:33,623 --> 01:23:36,148
I haven't spoken it in a while,

723
01:23:36,226 --> 01:23:42,530
but I would relish
the opportunity to converse

724
01:23:39,663 --> 01:23:42,530
with such a pretty
companion as yourself.

725
01:23:42,599 --> 01:23:47,002
It's my pleasure to be in the company
of such a fine gentleman as yourself.

726
01:23:47,070 --> 01:23:50,005
I must warn you, young lady...

727
01:23:50,073 --> 01:23:53,042
...I am susceptible to flattery.

728
01:23:56,146 --> 01:23:58,137
How may I be of service to you?

729
01:24:06,556 --> 01:24:08,251
Where's Bill?

730
01:24:10,627 --> 01:24:13,255
Ahh.

731
01:24:13,330 --> 01:24:15,355
You must be Beatrix.

732
01:24:17,434 --> 01:24:19,595
I can see the attraction.

733
01:24:22,272 --> 01:24:27,608
I remember when Bill was only
five years old, I took him to the movies.

734
01:24:27,677 --> 01:24:31,374
It was a movie starring Lana Turner.

735
01:24:31,448 --> 01:24:36,511
The Postman Always Ring Twice,
with John Garfields.

736
01:24:36,586 --> 01:24:39,851
And whenever she would
appear on the screen,

737
01:24:39,923 --> 01:24:45,555
Bill would begin compulsively to
suck his thumb to an obscene amount.

738
01:24:45,629 --> 01:24:51,192
And I knew from this very moment,
this boy was a fool for blonds.

739
01:24:56,706 --> 01:24:58,799
Mmm.

740
01:24:58,875 --> 01:25:00,536
You know...

741
01:25:00,610 --> 01:25:04,478
...being a fool for a woman
such as yourself...

742
01:25:04,548 --> 01:25:07,949
...is always the right thing to do.

743
01:25:09,953 --> 01:25:14,947
If we had met when I was
back in business...

744
01:25:15,025 --> 01:25:19,587
...you would have been
my number one lady.

745
01:25:21,998 --> 01:25:25,661
- Well, I'm flattered.
- You goddamn well better be.

746
01:25:28,038 --> 01:25:32,566
This... I heard you were driving a truck.

747
01:25:32,642 --> 01:25:34,576
My Pussy Wagon died on me.

748
01:25:35,512 --> 01:25:38,606
The Pussy died. Hmm.

749
01:25:41,418 --> 01:25:44,216
Bill shot you in the head, no?

750
01:25:44,287 --> 01:25:46,881
- Yes.
- Hmm.

751
01:25:48,158 --> 01:25:51,252
I would have been much nicer.

752
01:25:51,328 --> 01:25:53,626
I would have just cut your face.

753
01:25:56,700 --> 01:25:58,327
You must forgive me.

754
01:25:58,401 --> 01:26:00,892
Please... you have a drink with me.

755
01:26:04,307 --> 01:26:08,505
Clara! (smooches)

756
01:26:10,046 --> 01:26:11,775
Coming.

757
01:26:14,518 --> 01:26:16,349
Dos anejo.

758
01:26:28,865 --> 01:26:30,355
Gracias.

759
01:26:35,672 --> 01:26:38,698
What were we talking about?

760
01:26:45,048 --> 01:26:47,039
Bill.

761
01:26:48,785 --> 01:26:52,778
- Where's Bill?
- Where's Bill.

762
01:26:52,856 --> 01:26:55,347
Yeah. Hmm.

763
01:26:55,425 --> 01:27:00,954
Bill is at the Villa Quatro,
on the road to Salina.

764
01:27:01,031 --> 01:27:03,329
I will draw you a map.

765
01:27:04,868 --> 01:27:07,200
Bill is like a son to me.

766
01:27:08,838 --> 01:27:12,831
- Do you know why I help you?
- No.

767
01:27:12,909 --> 01:27:14,843
Because he would want me to.

768
01:27:16,313 --> 01:27:18,747
Now, that I don't believe.

769
01:27:18,815 --> 01:27:21,249
Ahh.

770
01:27:21,318 --> 01:27:25,846
How else is he ever
going to see you again?

771
01:28:33,823 --> 01:28:35,450
Freeze, Mommy.

772
01:28:35,525 --> 01:28:37,516
Bang, bang! Oh!

773
01:28:37,594 --> 01:28:39,824
Oh! She got us, B.B.

774
01:28:39,896 --> 01:28:42,831
Mommy got us.
Oh, I'm dying!

775
01:28:42,899 --> 01:28:46,164
I'm dying.

776
01:28:47,637 --> 01:28:51,095
Fall down, sweetheart.
Mommy shot us.

777
01:28:52,642 --> 01:28:59,172
But little did Quickdraw Kiddo know
that little B.B. was only playing possum,

778
01:28:59,249 --> 01:29:04,346
due to the fact that
she was impervious to bullets.

779
01:29:04,421 --> 01:29:06,480
I am pervious to bullets, Mommy.

780
01:29:06,556 --> 01:29:10,185
Hey, get back down there.
You're playing possum.

781
01:29:10,327 --> 01:29:18,959
So, as the smirking killer
advanced on what she thought

782
01:29:16,032 --> 01:29:21,470
was a bullet-ridden corpse,
that's when little B.B. fired.

783
01:29:23,740 --> 01:29:24,729
Bang, bang!

784
01:29:32,615 --> 01:29:36,847
You're dead, Mommy.
So die.

785
01:29:37,887 --> 01:29:39,445
Oh!

786
01:29:42,525 --> 01:29:43,549
B.B.

787
01:29:47,530 --> 01:29:51,364
Oh! B.B....

788
01:29:53,770 --> 01:29:56,898
I should've known.

789
01:29:56,973 --> 01:30:00,272
You are... the best.

790
01:30:07,250 --> 01:30:09,844
Oh, Mommy.
Don't die.

791
01:30:10,320 --> 01:30:12,481
I was just playing.

792
01:30:17,727 --> 01:30:19,251
I know.

793
01:30:33,410 --> 01:30:36,379
I told her that you were asleep...

794
01:30:36,446 --> 01:30:41,315
...but that one day you'd wake up
and come back to her.

795
01:30:41,384 --> 01:30:45,616
And she asked me, "lf Mommy's
been asleep since I was born,

796
01:30:45,688 --> 01:30:48,384
then how will she know what I look like?"

797
01:30:48,458 --> 01:30:55,125
To which I replied, "Because
Mommy's been dreaming of you."

798
01:30:56,099 --> 01:30:59,000
That's what I said.

799
01:30:59,068 --> 01:31:02,401
Did you dream of me?
I dreamed of you.

800
01:31:03,473 --> 01:31:07,170
Every single night, baby.
Every single night.

801
01:31:07,243 --> 01:31:10,303
I waited a long time
for you to wake up, Mommy.

802
01:31:22,459 --> 01:31:24,450
Now, let me look at you.

803
01:31:26,262 --> 01:31:27,490
Oh.

804
01:31:31,668 --> 01:31:35,536
My, my, my,
what a pretty little girl you are.

805
01:31:35,605 --> 01:31:37,334
You're pretty too, Mommy.

806
01:31:43,713 --> 01:31:47,274
Tell Mommy what you said
when I showed you her picture.

807
01:31:47,350 --> 01:31:48,442
Mnh-mnh.

808
01:31:48,518 --> 01:31:51,180
- Come on, shy girl.
- Mnh-mnh.

809
01:31:51,254 --> 01:31:53,916
Come on. You know what you said.

810
01:31:53,990 --> 01:31:58,256
Come on. Tell Mommy.
It'll make her feel good. Come on.

811
01:31:58,328 --> 01:32:00,819
- Mnh-mnh.
- Yeah. Come on.

812
01:32:00,897 --> 01:32:03,388
I said... I said,

813
01:32:03,466 --> 01:32:09,666
"You're the most beautifulest woman
I ever saw in the whole wide world."

814
01:32:11,307 --> 01:32:15,073
That's the truth.
That's what she said.

815
01:32:15,778 --> 01:32:21,876
B.B., don't you think Mommy has the
prettiest hair in the whole wide world?

816
01:32:21,951 --> 01:32:25,751
- Yes, I do.
- Matter of fact, it's better than pretty.

817
01:32:27,223 --> 01:32:31,956
- What's better than pretty?
- Mmm... Gorgeous.

818
01:32:32,028 --> 01:32:36,829
Very good. Gorgeous.
Mommy is gorgeous.

819
01:32:39,702 --> 01:32:44,730
Hmm. You know, sweetie,
Mommy's kinda mad at Daddy.

820
01:32:44,807 --> 01:32:47,708
Why, Daddy?
Were you being a bad daddy?

821
01:32:47,777 --> 01:32:52,180
I'm afraid I was.
I was a real bad daddy.

822
01:32:53,750 --> 01:32:57,743
Our little girl learned about
life and death the other day.

823
01:32:57,820 --> 01:33:02,723
Wanna tell Mommy about
what happened to Emilio?

824
01:33:04,427 --> 01:33:07,362
I killed him.

825
01:33:07,430 --> 01:33:12,527
- Emilio was her goldfish.
- Emilio was my goldfiss.

826
01:33:12,602 --> 01:33:17,266
She came running into my room,
holding the fish in her hand and crying,

827
01:33:17,340 --> 01:33:20,309
"Daddy. Daddy.
Emilio's dead."

828
01:33:22,011 --> 01:33:26,072
And I said, "Really? That's so sad.

829
01:33:26,149 --> 01:33:28,344
How did he die?"

830
01:33:28,418 --> 01:33:31,512
- And what did you say?
- I stepped on him.

831
01:33:31,588 --> 01:33:36,821
Actually, young lady, the words
you so strategically used were,

832
01:33:36,893 --> 01:33:40,795
"l accidentally stepped on him."

833
01:33:40,863 --> 01:33:42,797
To which I queried,

834
01:33:42,865 --> 01:33:48,360
"And just how did your foot accidentally
find its way into Emilio's fishbowl?"

835
01:33:48,438 --> 01:33:52,704
And she said, "No, no, no. Emilio was
on the carpet when I stepped on him."

836
01:33:52,775 --> 01:33:56,711
Mmm. The plot thickens.

837
01:33:56,779 --> 01:34:01,682
"And just how did Emilio
get on the carpet?"

838
01:34:01,751 --> 01:34:05,118
And Mommy, you would've been
so proud of her.

839
01:34:07,557 --> 01:34:09,582
She didn't lie.

840
01:34:09,659 --> 01:34:13,823
She said she took Emilio
out of his bowl...

841
01:34:13,896 --> 01:34:17,423
...and put him on the carpet.

842
01:34:18,968 --> 01:34:23,029
And what was Emilio
doing on the carpet?

843
01:34:23,106 --> 01:34:24,937
Flapping.

844
01:34:26,042 --> 01:34:29,842
- And then you stomped on him.
- Uh-huh.

845
01:34:29,912 --> 01:34:33,712
And when you lifted up your foot...

846
01:34:33,783 --> 01:34:37,844
-...what was Emilio doing then?
- Nothing.

847
01:34:37,920 --> 01:34:40,684
He stopped flapping, didn't he?

848
01:34:43,192 --> 01:34:45,660
She told me later...

849
01:34:45,728 --> 01:34:48,026
...that the second she lifted up her foot

850
01:34:48,097 --> 01:34:52,329
and saw Emilio not flapping,
she knew what she had done.

851
01:34:52,402 --> 01:34:57,499
Is that not the perfect
visual image of life and death?

852
01:34:57,573 --> 01:35:02,738
A fish flapping on the carpet,
and a fish not flapping on the carpet.

853
01:35:04,881 --> 01:35:13,648
So powerful, even a four-year-old
with no concept of life or death..

854
01:35:11,020 --> 01:35:13,648
...knew what it meant.

855
01:35:14,357 --> 01:35:17,451
- You loved Emilio, didn't you?
- Uh-huh.

856
01:35:17,527 --> 01:35:20,462
Well... I love Mommy, too.

857
01:35:21,931 --> 01:35:24,161
But I did to Mommy
what you did to Emilio.

858
01:35:24,233 --> 01:35:28,192
- You stomped on Mommy?
- Worse.

859
01:35:28,271 --> 01:35:30,364
I shot Mommy.

860
01:35:30,440 --> 01:35:33,603
Not pretend shooting
like we were just doing.

861
01:35:33,676 --> 01:35:35,337
I shot her for real.

862
01:35:35,411 --> 01:35:37,879
Why? Did you want to see
what would happen?

863
01:35:37,947 --> 01:35:42,680
No, I knew what would happen
to Mommy if I shot her.

864
01:35:42,752 --> 01:35:47,246
What I didn't know was, when I shot
Mommy, what would happen to me.

865
01:35:47,323 --> 01:35:50,986
- What happened?
- I was very sad.

866
01:35:53,329 --> 01:35:55,559
And that's when I learned...

867
01:35:55,631 --> 01:36:00,762
...some things, once you do,
they can never be undone.

868
01:36:03,940 --> 01:36:09,071
- What happened to Mommy?
- Why don't you ask Mommy?

869
01:36:09,145 --> 01:36:12,308
You OK, Mommy?
Did it hurt?

870
01:36:12,381 --> 01:36:16,078
No, sweetie.

871
01:36:16,152 --> 01:36:18,552
Doesn't hurt anymore.

872
01:36:24,193 --> 01:36:26,184
Did it make you sick?

873
01:36:27,530 --> 01:36:31,864
No. It made me sleep.

874
01:36:31,934 --> 01:36:34,630
That's why I haven't been with you, B.B.
I've been asleep.

875
01:36:34,704 --> 01:36:38,435
But you're awake now, Mommy. Right?

876
01:36:38,508 --> 01:36:41,636
I'm wide awake, pretty girl.

877
01:36:41,711 --> 01:36:46,978
B.B., would you like Mommy to watch
a video with you before sleepy time?

878
01:36:47,049 --> 01:36:48,516
Uh-huh.

879
01:36:48,584 --> 01:36:52,350
Mommy, do you wanna watch
a video with me before sleepy time?

880
01:36:52,421 --> 01:36:55,117
Oh, yeah!
I would love to.

881
01:36:55,191 --> 01:36:57,989
- Which one do you wanna watch?
- Shogun Assassin.

882
01:36:58,060 --> 01:37:00,426
No, B.B.
Shogun Assassin is too long.

883
01:37:00,496 --> 01:37:04,557
- Mnh-mnh.
- No, it's not.

884
01:37:04,634 --> 01:37:08,900
Well, then, I'll leave you ladies to it.

885
01:37:15,812 --> 01:37:21,182
(boy) When I was little,
my father was famous.

886
01:37:21,250 --> 01:37:25,584
He was the greatest samurai
in the empire.

887
01:37:25,655 --> 01:37:28,954
And he was the shogun's decapitator.

888
01:37:29,025 --> 01:37:34,292
He cut off the heads of 131 lords.

889
01:37:34,363 --> 01:37:41,597
My father would come home to Mother
and when he would see her,

890
01:37:38,901 --> 01:37:41,597
he would forget about the killings.

891
01:37:41,671 --> 01:37:46,836
He wasn't scared of the shogun,
but the shogun was scared of him.

892
01:37:46,909 --> 01:37:49,605
Maybe that was the problem.

893
01:37:49,679 --> 01:37:52,512
One night, the shogun sent...

894
01:37:52,615 --> 01:37:57,177
(@ "About Her" by Malcolm McLaren)

895
01:38:05,361 --> 01:38:10,697
@ My man got a heart

896
01:38:10,766 --> 01:38:17,831
@ Like the rock that's in the sea

897
01:38:23,746 --> 01:38:30,584
@ Well, no one told me about her

898
01:38:30,653 --> 01:38:33,622
@ The way she lied

899
01:38:36,158 --> 01:38:42,722
@ Well, no one told me about her

900
01:38:42,798 --> 01:38:46,097
@ How many people cried

901
01:38:54,944 --> 01:39:00,610
@ My man got a heart

902
01:39:00,683 --> 01:39:07,646
@ Like the rock that's in the sea

903
01:39:07,723 --> 01:39:13,093
@ My man got a heart

904
01:39:13,162 --> 01:39:20,694
@ Like the rock that's in the sea

905
01:39:26,142 --> 01:39:32,980
@ Well, no one told me about her

906
01:39:33,049 --> 01:39:36,246
@ The way she lied

907
01:39:38,521 --> 01:39:45,085
@ Well, no one told me about her

908
01:39:45,161 --> 01:39:48,722
@ How many people cried

909
01:39:49,565 --> 01:39:55,697
@ But it's too late to say you're sorry

910
01:39:55,771 --> 01:39:58,331
@ How would I know?

911
01:39:58,407 --> 01:40:02,207
@ Why should I care?

912
01:40:02,278 --> 01:40:07,944
@ Please don't bother trying to find her

913
01:40:08,017 --> 01:40:12,716
@ She's not there

914
01:40:14,256 --> 01:40:17,157
I was just admiring your sword.

915
01:40:17,226 --> 01:40:20,753
Quite a piece of work.

916
01:40:20,830 --> 01:40:25,062
Speaking of which, how is Hanzo-san?

917
01:40:25,601 --> 01:40:27,068
He's good.

918
01:40:29,138 --> 01:40:32,107
Has his sushi gotten any better?

919
01:40:35,244 --> 01:40:40,045
You know, I couldn't believe it.
You got him to make you a sword.

920
01:40:40,116 --> 01:40:44,382
It was easy.
I just dropped your name, Bill.

921
01:40:44,453 --> 01:40:46,546
That'd do it.

922
01:40:59,735 --> 01:41:05,833
@ Well, no one told me about her

923
01:41:12,114 --> 01:41:16,778
@ Well, no one told me about her

924
01:41:17,820 --> 01:41:23,087
I suppose the idea is we cross
Hanzo swords. Am I right?

925
01:41:25,094 --> 01:41:26,721
Well,

926
01:41:26,796 --> 01:41:32,029
it just so happens this hacienda
has its own private beach.

927
01:41:32,101 --> 01:41:39,364
And that private beach just so happens
to look particularly beautiful

928
01:41:36,372 --> 01:41:39,364
bathed in moonlight.

929
01:41:39,442 --> 01:41:42,240
And there just so happens to be
a full moon out tonight.

930
01:41:42,311 --> 01:41:49,046
So, swordfighter, if you want
a swordfight, that's where I suggest.

931
01:41:49,718 --> 01:41:53,347
But if you wanna be old school about it..

932
01:41:53,422 --> 01:41:57,051
...and you know
I'm all about old school...

933
01:41:57,126 --> 01:42:00,892
...then we could wait until dawn
and slice each other up at sunrise

934
01:42:00,963 --> 01:42:03,227
Iike a couple of real-life honest...

935
01:42:05,501 --> 01:42:10,404
Now, if you don't settle down, I'm gonna
have to put one in your kneecap.

936
01:42:10,473 --> 01:42:13,772
And I hear tell that's
a very painful place to get shot in.

937
01:42:15,878 --> 01:42:19,609
I'm just fuckin' with you.

938
01:42:21,484 --> 01:42:23,611
Now...

939
01:42:23,686 --> 01:42:26,246
...when it comes to you...

940
01:42:26,322 --> 01:42:28,313
...and us...

941
01:42:29,925 --> 01:42:33,088
...I have a few unanswered questions.

942
01:42:33,162 --> 01:42:39,624
So, before this tale of bloody revenge
reaches its climax,

943
01:42:39,702 --> 01:42:44,969
I'm gonna ask you some questions,
and I want you to tell me the truth.

944
01:42:45,040 --> 01:42:49,272
However, therein lies a dilemma.

945
01:42:49,345 --> 01:42:57,284
Because when it comes
to the subject of me,

946
01:42:51,914 --> 01:42:57,284
I believe you are truly and utterly
incapable of telling the truth.

947
01:42:57,353 --> 01:43:01,756
Especially to me.
And least of all, to yourself.

948
01:43:01,824 --> 01:43:05,316
And when it comes to the subject of me,

949
01:43:05,394 --> 01:43:12,197
I am truly and utterly incapable
of believing anything you say.

950
01:43:12,268 --> 01:43:14,293
How do you suppose
we solve this dilemma?

951
01:43:14,370 --> 01:43:16,133
Well,

952
01:43:16,205 --> 01:43:18,196
it just so happens,

953
01:43:18,274 --> 01:43:20,401
I have a solution.

954
01:43:20,476 --> 01:43:22,910
- Aah!
- Gotcha!

955
01:43:22,978 --> 01:43:25,139
Goddamn!

956
01:43:27,650 --> 01:43:31,051
What the fuck
did you just shoot me with?

957
01:43:31,120 --> 01:43:34,851
My greatest invention.
Or at least my favorite.

958
01:43:35,624 --> 01:43:38,491
Don't touch it, or I'll stick another one
right in your cheek.

959
01:43:43,232 --> 01:43:49,501
What lies within that dart, just begging
to course its way through your veins...

960
01:43:49,572 --> 01:43:54,100
...is an incredibly potent
and quite infallible truth serum.

961
01:43:54,176 --> 01:43:57,304
I call it "The Undisputed Truth."

962
01:43:57,379 --> 01:44:02,874
Twice as strong as sodium pentothal,
with no druggie aftereffects.

963
01:44:02,952 --> 01:44:08,686
Except for a slight wave of euphoria.
You feel it?

964
01:44:08,757 --> 01:44:11,749
- Euphoria?
- Yeah.

965
01:44:11,827 --> 01:44:14,796
- No.
- Too bad.

966
01:44:15,931 --> 01:44:18,229
As you know...

967
01:44:18,300 --> 01:44:21,758
...I'm quite keen on comic books.

968
01:44:22,571 --> 01:44:25,438
Especially the ones about superheroes.

969
01:44:25,507 --> 01:44:31,070
I find the whole mythology
surrounding superheroes fascinating.

970
01:44:31,146 --> 01:44:35,742
Take my favorite superhero, Superman.

971
01:44:35,818 --> 01:44:38,878
Not a great comic book.
Not particularly well-drawn.

972
01:44:40,522 --> 01:44:42,217
Mmm.

973
01:44:42,291 --> 01:44:44,691
But the mythology...

974
01:44:44,760 --> 01:44:48,127
The mythology is not only great,
it's unique.

975
01:44:48,197 --> 01:44:52,463
How long does this shit take
to go into effect?

976
01:44:52,534 --> 01:44:56,470
About two minutes. Just long enough
for me to finish my point.

977
01:44:56,538 --> 01:45:04,836
Now, a staple of the superhero
mythology is,

978
01:45:01,810 --> 01:45:04,836
there's the superhero
and there's the alter ego.

979
01:45:04,913 --> 01:45:09,145
Batman is actually Bruce Wayne,
Spider-Man is actually Peter Parker.

980
01:45:10,319 --> 01:45:14,153
When that character wakes up
in the morning, he's Peter Parker.

981
01:45:14,223 --> 01:45:19,388
He has to put on a costume
to become Spider-Man.

982
01:45:19,461 --> 01:45:25,297
And it is in that characteristic
Superman stands alone.

983
01:45:25,367 --> 01:45:28,200
Superman didn't become Superman.

984
01:45:28,270 --> 01:45:30,966
Superman was born Superman.

985
01:45:31,040 --> 01:45:35,374
When Superman wakes up
in the morning, he's Superman.

986
01:45:35,444 --> 01:45:37,969
His alter ego is Clark Kent.

987
01:45:38,981 --> 01:45:42,144
His outfit with the big red "S" -

988
01:45:42,217 --> 01:45:45,880
that's the blanket he was wrapped in
as a baby when the Kents found him.

989
01:45:45,954 --> 01:45:48,821
Those are his clothes.

990
01:45:48,891 --> 01:46:00,362
What Kent wears - the glasses,
the business suit - that's the costume.

991
01:45:54,196 --> 01:46:00,362
That's the costume Superman wears
to blend in with us.

992
01:46:00,436 --> 01:46:03,894
Clark Kent is how Superman views us.

993
01:46:03,972 --> 01:46:07,237
And what are the characteristics
of Clark Kent?

994
01:46:07,309 --> 01:46:09,641
He's weak...

995
01:46:09,712 --> 01:46:12,579
...he's unsure of himself...

996
01:46:12,648 --> 01:46:14,377
...he's a coward.

997
01:46:15,417 --> 01:46:20,354
Clark Kent is Superman's critique
on the whole human race.

998
01:46:22,124 --> 01:46:26,857
Sorta like Beatrix Kiddo
and Mrs. Tommy Plimpton.

999
01:46:28,063 --> 01:46:30,293
Aso.

1000
01:46:30,366 --> 01:46:32,561
The point emerges.

1001
01:46:34,269 --> 01:46:37,796
You would've worn the costume
of Arlene Plimpton.

1002
01:46:37,873 --> 01:46:41,639
But you were born Beatrix Kiddo.

1003
01:46:41,710 --> 01:46:46,670
And every morning when you woke up,
you'd still be Beatrix Kiddo.

1004
01:46:46,749 --> 01:46:48,910
Oh, you can... take the needle out.

1005
01:46:56,258 --> 01:46:58,522
Are you calling me a superhero?

1006
01:46:58,594 --> 01:47:00,789
I'm calling you a killer.

1007
01:47:00,863 --> 01:47:03,764
A natural born killer.

1008
01:47:03,832 --> 01:47:07,461
You always have been,
and you always will be.

1009
01:47:07,536 --> 01:47:09,766
Moving to El Paso...

1010
01:47:09,838 --> 01:47:13,239
...working in a used record store...

1011
01:47:13,308 --> 01:47:15,833
...goin' to the movies with Tommy...

1012
01:47:15,911 --> 01:47:17,401
...clipping coupons.

1013
01:47:17,479 --> 01:47:19,310
That's you...

1014
01:47:19,381 --> 01:47:22,873
...trying to disguise yourself
as a worker bee.

1015
01:47:22,951 --> 01:47:25,977
That's you tryin' to blend in with the hive.

1016
01:47:26,054 --> 01:47:28,454
But you're not a worker bee.

1017
01:47:29,458 --> 01:47:32,291
You're a renegade killer bee.

1018
01:47:32,361 --> 01:47:35,159
And no matter how much beer you drank
or barbecue you ate

1019
01:47:35,230 --> 01:47:38,529
or how fat your ass got,

1020
01:47:38,600 --> 01:47:42,468
nothing in the world
would ever change that.

1021
01:47:44,907 --> 01:47:46,932
First question:

1022
01:47:49,144 --> 01:47:54,480
Did you really think your life in El Paso
was gonna work?

1023
01:48:00,222 --> 01:48:02,213
No!

1024
01:48:05,360 --> 01:48:08,386
But I would've had B.B.!

1025
01:48:08,464 --> 01:48:11,160
Don't get me wrong.

1026
01:48:11,233 --> 01:48:15,135
I think you would have been
a wonderful mother.

1027
01:48:15,204 --> 01:48:17,729
But you are a killer.

1028
01:48:21,877 --> 01:48:24,641
All those people you killed to get to me...

1029
01:48:24,713 --> 01:48:27,181
...felt damn good, didn't they?

1030
01:48:29,351 --> 01:48:31,819
Yes.

1031
01:48:31,887 --> 01:48:34,185
Every single one of them?

1032
01:48:44,466 --> 01:48:46,195
Yes.

1033
01:48:49,538 --> 01:48:52,132
That was the warmup round.

1034
01:48:52,207 --> 01:48:57,509
Now comes the $64,000 question.

1035
01:49:04,253 --> 01:49:07,848
Why did you run away
from me with my baby?

1036
01:49:11,693 --> 01:49:15,129
Do you remember the last assignment
you sent me on?

1037
01:49:15,197 --> 01:49:17,631
Of course.

1038
01:49:17,699 --> 01:49:19,724
Lisa Wong.

1039
01:49:21,069 --> 01:49:23,629
The morning I left, I was sick.

1040
01:49:25,307 --> 01:49:27,935
On the plane, I threw up.

1041
01:49:29,778 --> 01:49:33,646
So I started thinking:

1042
01:49:33,715 --> 01:49:35,876
Maybe I was pregnant.

1043
01:49:35,951 --> 01:49:40,411
"Easy to use. Remove cap and urinate
on the absorbent end for five seconds.

1044
01:49:42,591 --> 01:49:48,652
"Accurate results in only 90 seconds.

1045
01:49:45,160 --> 01:49:48,652
You can read the results as soon as
the line appears in the window."

1046
01:50:25,033 --> 01:50:26,057
Fuck.

1047
01:50:26,134 --> 01:50:28,295
What I didn't know...

1048
01:50:28,370 --> 01:50:32,431
...was that somewhere on my journey
I had been spotted.

1049
01:50:32,507 --> 01:50:38,605
With me in L.A., it didn't take Lisa Wong
long to send an assassin of her own.

1050
01:50:38,680 --> 01:50:41,410
-  Hello, can I help you?

1051
01:50:41,483 --> 01:50:44,816
Hello, I'm Karen Kim.
I'm the hospitality manager of the hotel.

1052
01:50:44,886 --> 01:50:46,683
I have a welcome gift
from the management.

1053
01:50:46,755 --> 01:50:49,952
Oh, that's nice. Um...

1054
01:50:50,025 --> 01:50:52,016
Can you just leave it by the door?

1055
01:51:04,506 --> 01:51:07,703
- You pretty good with that shotgun?
- Not that I have to be at this range,

1056
01:51:07,776 --> 01:51:09,676
but I'm a fuckin' surgeon
with this shotgun.

1057
01:51:09,745 --> 01:51:12,805
Well, guess what, bitch?
I'm better than Annie Oakley.

1058
01:51:12,881 --> 01:51:16,282
- And I got you right in my sight.
- I could blow your fuckin' head off.

1059
01:51:16,351 --> 01:51:20,515
Not before I put one
right between your eyes, so let's talk.

1060
01:51:22,190 --> 01:51:24,351
Karen...

1061
01:51:26,294 --> 01:51:28,626
...I just found out...

1062
01:51:28,697 --> 01:51:30,665
...right now...

1063
01:51:30,732 --> 01:51:36,693
...not a moment before
you blew a hole through the door...

1064
01:51:36,772 --> 01:51:39,639
-...that I'm pregnant.
- What is this?

1065
01:51:41,143 --> 01:51:43,976
On the floor by the door...

1066
01:51:44,046 --> 01:51:47,174
...is a strip that says I'm pregnant.

1067
01:51:47,249 --> 01:51:48,409
Bullshit.

1068
01:51:49,685 --> 01:51:53,348
Any other time
you'd be 100 percent right.

1069
01:51:53,422 --> 01:51:56,289
This time...

1070
01:51:56,358 --> 01:51:58,383
...you're 100 percent wrong.

1071
01:52:00,929 --> 01:52:04,524
I'm the deadliest woman in the world.

1072
01:52:04,599 --> 01:52:06,794
But right now...

1073
01:52:06,868 --> 01:52:09,234
...I'm just scared shitless for my baby.

1074
01:52:10,105 --> 01:52:12,096
Please.

1075
01:52:13,208 --> 01:52:15,608
Just look at the strip.

1076
01:52:17,679 --> 01:52:19,408
Please.

1077
01:52:20,716 --> 01:52:25,449
Stay where you are and don't move.

1078
01:52:42,637 --> 01:52:45,003
I don't know what this fuckin' shit means.

1079
01:52:45,073 --> 01:52:47,473
The box with the directions -
it's right there.

1080
01:52:59,221 --> 01:53:00,916
"Easy to use.

1081
01:53:00,989 --> 01:53:05,551
Remove the cap and urinate
on the absorbent end."

1082
01:53:05,627 --> 01:53:07,288
Blue means pregnant.

1083
01:53:08,096 --> 01:53:10,087
I'll read it myself, thank you.

1084
01:53:16,972 --> 01:53:19,907
Oh, OK.

1085
01:53:19,975 --> 01:53:22,205
Say I were to believe you.
What then?

1086
01:53:22,277 --> 01:53:24,905
Just go home.

1087
01:53:26,014 --> 01:53:28,107
I'll do the same.

1088
01:53:47,702 --> 01:53:49,294
Congratulations.

1089
01:53:52,974 --> 01:53:55,772
Before that strip turned blue...

1090
01:53:55,844 --> 01:53:59,280
...I was a woman, I was your woman.

1091
01:53:59,347 --> 01:54:02,908
I was a killer who killed for you.

1092
01:54:02,984 --> 01:54:06,078
Before that strip turned blue,
I would've jumped a motorcycle

1093
01:54:06,154 --> 01:54:09,146
onto a speeding train.

1094
01:54:09,224 --> 01:54:11,215
For you.

1095
01:54:12,527 --> 01:54:15,894
But once that strip turned blue...

1096
01:54:15,964 --> 01:54:19,456
...I could no longer do
any of those things.

1097
01:54:19,534 --> 01:54:22,002
Not anymore.

1098
01:54:22,070 --> 01:54:24,630
Because I was gonna be a mother.

1099
01:54:27,742 --> 01:54:29,505
Can you understand that?

1100
01:54:32,714 --> 01:54:35,308
Yes.

1101
01:54:35,383 --> 01:54:37,544
But why didn't you...

1102
01:54:37,619 --> 01:54:40,782
...tell me then, instead of now?

1103
01:54:40,856 --> 01:54:43,154
Once you knew, you'd claim her.

1104
01:54:43,225 --> 01:54:45,216
And I didn't want that.

1105
01:54:45,961 --> 01:54:48,191
Not your decision to make.

1106
01:54:48,263 --> 01:54:50,390
Yes.

1107
01:54:50,465 --> 01:54:54,731
But it's the right decision,
and I made it for my daughter.

1108
01:54:54,803 --> 01:54:59,467
She deserved to be born
with a clean slate.

1109
01:54:59,541 --> 01:55:01,532
But with you...

1110
01:55:01,610 --> 01:55:05,740
...she would've been born
into a world she shouldn't have.

1111
01:55:07,249 --> 01:55:10,446
I had to choose.

1112
01:55:10,518 --> 01:55:12,509
I chose her.

1113
01:55:15,090 --> 01:55:17,888
You know, five years ago,

1114
01:55:17,959 --> 01:55:22,828
if I had to make a list of impossible
things that could never happen,

1115
01:55:22,898 --> 01:55:28,530
you performing a coup de grace on me
by bustin' a cap in my crown...

1116
01:55:30,939 --> 01:55:33,601
...would've been right
at the top of the list.

1117
01:55:35,277 --> 01:55:37,302
I'd have been wrong, wouldn't l?

1118
01:55:38,613 --> 01:55:40,547
I-I'm sorry.

1119
01:55:40,615 --> 01:55:42,742
Was that a question?

1120
01:55:43,985 --> 01:55:49,919
Of impossible things
that could never happen -

1121
01:55:46,688 --> 01:55:49,919
yes, in this instance,
you would've been wrong.

1122
01:55:50,825 --> 01:55:51,883
Well?

1123
01:55:52,894 --> 01:55:55,590
When you never came back,

1124
01:55:55,664 --> 01:56:01,830
I naturally assumed Lisa Wong,
or somebody else, had killed you.

1125
01:56:01,903 --> 01:56:05,134
Oh! And for the record...

1126
01:56:05,206 --> 01:56:09,404
...Ietting somebody think somebody
they love is dead when they're not

1127
01:56:09,477 --> 01:56:11,468
is quite cruel.

1128
01:56:14,883 --> 01:56:18,751
I mourned you for three months.

1129
01:56:19,554 --> 01:56:23,923
And in the third month of mourning you...

1130
01:56:23,992 --> 01:56:26,358
...I tracked you down.

1131
01:56:26,428 --> 01:56:28,555
I wasn't tryin' to track you down.

1132
01:56:28,630 --> 01:56:34,068
I was tryin' to track down
the fucking assholes I thought killed you.

1133
01:56:34,135 --> 01:56:37,627
So I find you...

1134
01:56:37,706 --> 01:56:39,901
...and what do I find?

1135
01:56:39,975 --> 01:56:43,308
Not only are you not dead...

1136
01:56:43,378 --> 01:56:47,439
...you're getting married
to some fucking jerk.

1137
01:56:49,751 --> 01:56:52,276
And you're pregnant.

1138
01:56:55,590 --> 01:56:57,956
I overreacted.

1139
01:57:06,601 --> 01:57:10,401
You overreacted?
Is that your explanation?

1140
01:57:10,472 --> 01:57:12,906
I didn't say I was gonna explain myself.

1141
01:57:12,974 --> 01:57:15,408
I said I was gonna tell you the truth.

1142
01:57:15,977 --> 01:57:19,913
But if that's too cryptic, let's get literal.

1143
01:57:22,384 --> 01:57:24,875
I'm a killer.

1144
01:57:24,953 --> 01:57:27,854
I'm a murdering bastard.
You know that.

1145
01:57:28,456 --> 01:57:35,759
And there are consequences...

1146
01:57:31,493 --> 01:57:35,759
...to breaking the heart
of a murdering bastard.

1147
01:57:35,830 --> 01:57:38,390
You experienced some of them.

1148
01:57:41,903 --> 01:57:45,498
Was my reaction really that surprising?

1149
01:57:45,573 --> 01:57:49,270
Yes. It was.

1150
01:57:51,679 --> 01:57:55,445
Could you do what you did?

1151
01:57:55,517 --> 01:57:59,248
Of course you could.

1152
01:57:59,320 --> 01:58:05,748
But I never thought you would,
or could, do that to me.

1153
01:58:05,827 --> 01:58:08,853
I'm really sorry, Kiddo...

1154
01:58:08,930 --> 01:58:11,091
...but you thought wrong.

1155
01:58:17,338 --> 01:58:21,468
You and I have unfinished business.

1156
01:58:22,343 --> 01:58:25,642
Baby... you ain't kiddin'.

1157
01:58:58,713 --> 01:59:04,117
Pai Mei taught you the Five-Point-Palm
Exploding-Heart Technique?

1158
01:59:07,288 --> 01:59:09,449
'Course he did.

1159
01:59:11,326 --> 01:59:13,351
Why didn't you tell me?

1160
01:59:17,232 --> 01:59:19,291
I don't know.

1161
01:59:21,703 --> 01:59:24,638
Because I'm...

1162
01:59:24,706 --> 01:59:27,800
...a bad person.

1163
01:59:27,876 --> 01:59:29,969
No.

1164
01:59:31,412 --> 01:59:34,472
You're not a bad person.

1165
01:59:34,549 --> 01:59:37,541
You're a terrific person.

1166
01:59:37,619 --> 01:59:40,110
You're my favorite person.

1167
01:59:42,023 --> 01:59:45,925
But every once in a while...

1168
01:59:45,994 --> 01:59:47,985
...you can be a real cunt.

1169
02:00:07,482 --> 02:00:09,473
How do I look?

1170
02:00:25,200 --> 02:00:28,533
You look ready.

1171
02:02:14,242 --> 02:02:18,474
Well, well, well.
If it ain't the little flower.

1172
02:02:24,552 --> 02:02:26,918
(narrator) Good evening, Mr. and Mrs.
America and all the ships at sea.

1173
02:02:26,988 --> 02:02:28,979
Let's go to press. Flash.

1174
02:02:29,057 --> 02:02:31,787
Do you have a magpie in your home?

1175
02:02:31,859 --> 02:02:34,225
If you do, you are most fortunate.

1176
02:02:34,295 --> 02:02:37,958
The magpie is the most
charming bird in all the world.

1177
02:02:38,032 --> 02:02:40,500
He is the best friend a farmer ever had.

1178
02:02:40,568 --> 02:02:43,628
Treat him gently.
Treat him kindly.

1179
02:02:43,705 --> 02:02:48,165
And always remember,
the magpie deserves your respect.

1180
02:03:24,212 --> 02:03:26,680
Thank you.

1181
02:03:26,748 --> 02:03:30,707
Thank you.
Thank you.

1182
02:03:30,785 --> 02:03:32,912
Oh, thank you.

1183
02:03:35,356 --> 02:03:37,221
(magpie) Now, I'll tell you what
I'm gonna do.

1184
02:03:37,291 --> 02:03:39,919
I ain't got no headache.

1185
02:03:39,994 --> 02:03:42,394
(magpie) Oh yes you have, brother.
