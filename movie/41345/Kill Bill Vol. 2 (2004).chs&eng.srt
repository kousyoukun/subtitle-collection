1
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:17,808
你以为我在玩性虐待吗？
Do you find me sadistic?

2
00:00:19,218 --> 00:00:20,913
知道吗，小妞儿…
You know, Kiddo...

3
00:00:21,487 --> 00:00:27,278
我相信即使现在你还很清醒…
...I'd like to believe...

4
00:00:23,857 --> 00:00:26,484
...you're aware enough, even now...

5
00:00:27,559 --> 00:00:33,828
知道我不是在玩性虐待
...to know that there's nothing sadistic...

6
00:00:31,281 --> 00:00:33,158
...in my actions.

7
00:00:35,067 --> 00:00:38,503
此时此刻
At this moment...

8
00:00:38,537 --> 00:00:41,131
是我…
...this is me...

9
00:00:41,173 --> 00:00:43,971
最痛苦的时候
...at my most masochistic.

10
00:00:44,009 --> 00:00:46,443
比尔
Bill.

11
00:00:46,478 --> 00:00:48,070
这是你的骨肉
It's your ba...

12
00:00:53,085 --> 00:00:55,076
你以为我死了？
Looked dead, didn't I?

13
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,553
我没死
Well, I wasn't.

14
00:00:56,588 --> 00:01:00,183
但我是从鬼门关爬回来的
But it wasn't from lack of trying, I can tell you that.

15
00:01:00,225 --> 00:01:03,456
事实上，比尔用最后一颗子弹让我昏迷
Actually, Bill's last bullet put me in a coma -

16
00:01:03,495 --> 00:01:07,431
一场长达四年的昏迷
a coma I was to lie in for four years.

17
00:01:07,466 --> 00:01:08,933
醒来以后
When I woke up, I went on what the movie advertisements refer to as

18
00:01:08,967 --> 00:01:12,095
就开始了像电影广告词似的

19
00:01:12,137 --> 00:01:15,538
“怒吼着疯狂的复仇”
"a roaring rampage of revenge. "

20
00:01:15,574 --> 00:01:16,939
我怒吼了
I roared, and I rampaged,

21
00:01:16,975 --> 00:01:18,738
也疯狂了

22
00:01:18,777 --> 00:01:22,304
我从血腥中得到满足
and I got bloody satisfaction.

23
00:01:22,347 --> 00:01:26,215
我杀了很多人才走到这个地步
I've killed a hell of a lot of people to get to this point,

24
00:01:26,251 --> 00:01:29,618
只剩下一个人了
but I've only one more.

25
00:01:29,655 --> 00:01:31,748
最后一个
The last one.

26
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:35,385
我正要开车去找他
The one I'm driving to right now.

27
00:01:35,427 --> 00:01:38,191
唯一剩下的
The only one left.

28
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:41,757
等我到达了目的地
And when I arrive at my destination,

29
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:45,258
就要亲手杀死比尔
I am gonna kill Bill.

30
00:01:49,871 --> 00:01:53,107
杀死比尔 第二卷

31
00:02:03,621 --> 00:02:06,624
第六章 双松镇大屠杀

32
00:02:10,829 --> 00:02:13,923
发生在双松镇的大屠杀
The incident that happened at the Two Pines Wedding Chapel

33
00:02:13,966 --> 00:02:17,333
也就是这个血腥故事的导火线
that put this whole gory story into motion

34
00:02:17,369 --> 00:02:19,701
如今已成追忆
has since become legend.

35
00:02:20,105 --> 00:02:22,733
双松镇屠杀案
"Massacre at Two Pines. "

36
00:02:22,774 --> 00:02:24,639
这是报纸的标题
That's what the newspapers called it.

37
00:02:24,676 --> 00:02:26,576
当地电视新闻称之为
The local TV news called it,

38
00:02:26,612 --> 00:02:30,844
德州埃尔帕索“结婚礼拜堂屠杀案”
"The El Paso, Texas Wedding Chapel Massacre. "

39
00:02:30,883 --> 00:02:32,145
事发过程
How it happened, who was there,

40
00:02:32,184 --> 00:02:33,515
谁在场
how many got killed and who killed them -

41
00:02:33,552 --> 00:02:36,453
死了几个人、凶手是谁

42
00:02:36,488 --> 00:02:40,151
各界的说词不一
changes depending on who's telling the story.

43
00:02:40,192 --> 00:02:41,819
事实上
In actual fact, the massacre didn't happen during a wedding at all.

44
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:45,591
这根本不是婚礼大屠杀

45
00:02:45,631 --> 00:02:48,259
那次是婚礼前的彩排
It was a wedding rehearsal.

46
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:53,237
等到我说“你可以亲吻新娘”时
Now, when we come to the part where I say,

47
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:54,465
"You may kiss the bride," you may kiss the bride.

48
00:02:53,272 --> 00:02:55,001
你就可以亲吻新娘了
But don't stick your tongue in her mouth.

49
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,531
但别把舌头伸进她嘴里

50
00:02:59,578 --> 00:03:01,808
你们的朋友或许觉得好笑
This might be funny to your friends,

51
00:03:01,847 --> 00:03:05,647
但双方家长会面红耳赤
but it would be embarrassing to your parents.

52
00:03:06,718 --> 00:03:09,448
牧师，我们会尽量克制自己
We'll try to restrain ourselves, Reverend.

53
00:03:11,089 --> 00:03:13,319
要点歌吗？
Y'all got a song?

54
00:03:16,495 --> 00:03:18,019
温柔地爱我如何？
How about "Love Me Tender"? I can play that.

55
00:03:18,063 --> 00:03:20,122
那首我会弹

56
00:03:20,165 --> 00:03:21,928
好啊
- Sure. - Yeah.

57
00:03:21,967 --> 00:03:23,867
那首歌很好听
"Love Me Tender" would be great.

58
00:03:24,369 --> 00:03:26,428
鲁弗斯很厉害
Rufus - he's the man.

59
00:03:27,439 --> 00:03:30,602
鲁弗斯，你以前替谁演奏？
Rufus, who was that that you used to play for?

60
00:03:30,642 --> 00:03:32,542
鲁弗斯・汤玛斯
Rufus Thomas.

61
00:03:32,578 --> 00:03:34,671
鲁弗斯・汤玛斯
Rufus Thomas. Rufus Thomas.

62
00:03:34,713 --> 00:03:35,702
鲁弗斯・汤玛斯
I was a Drell. I was a Drifter. I was a Coaster.

63
00:03:35,747 --> 00:03:37,180
还有德雷尔乐团

64
00:03:37,216 --> 00:03:38,513
漂流者乐团

65
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:39,983
航海者乐团

66
00:03:40,018 --> 00:03:41,815
库尔与伙伴乐团
I was part of the Gang. I was a Barkay.

67
00:03:41,853 --> 00:03:43,616
Bar-Kay乐团

68
00:03:43,655 --> 00:03:45,486
只要他们来德州
If they come through Texas, I done played with 'em.

69
00:03:45,524 --> 00:03:47,424
我都会去伴奏

70
00:03:48,093 --> 00:03:50,027
鲁弗斯
Rufus - he's the man.

71
00:03:50,062 --> 00:03:51,461
他很厉害

72
00:03:54,533 --> 00:03:56,763
我有没有漏了什么？
- Have I forgotten anything? - Um...

73
00:03:56,802 --> 00:03:58,702
有，你漏了
Oh yes, you forgot, uh, the seating arrangements.

74
00:03:58,737 --> 00:04:00,398
座位安排

75
00:04:00,439 --> 00:04:02,202
母亲，谢谢你
- Thank you, Mother. - Yes.

76
00:04:03,108 --> 00:04:05,303
通常在座位的安排上
Now, the way we normally do this -

77
00:04:05,344 --> 00:04:07,778
分成新娘的家属
we have the bride's side, and then we have the groom's side.

78
00:04:07,813 --> 00:04:09,508
以及新郎的家属两边

79
00:04:09,548 --> 00:04:12,779
但这次新娘没有家属要来
But since the bride ain't got nobody comin',

80
00:04:12,818 --> 00:04:14,217
而新郎
and the groom's got far too many people comin'...

81
00:04:14,253 --> 00:04:16,915
却有太多家属要来

82
00:04:16,955 --> 00:04:19,355
大老远从奥克拉荷马州赶来
Well, yeah, they're comin' all the way from Oklahoma.

83
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:23,184
没错
Right...

84
00:04:23,228 --> 00:04:26,129
我倒不介意
Well, I don't see no problem with...

85
00:04:26,164 --> 00:04:29,861
新郎的家属坐到新娘那边
...the groom's side sharing the bride's side.

86
00:04:29,901 --> 00:04:30,697
母亲，你介意吗？
- Do you, Mother? - I don't have a problem with that.

87
00:04:30,736 --> 00:04:32,636
我也无所谓

88
00:04:32,671 --> 00:04:34,400
不过
But, uh...

89
00:04:34,439 --> 00:04:38,808
若新娘能找家属来会更好
Honey, you know, it would be good if you had somebody come.

90
00:04:38,844 --> 00:04:42,746
这是善意的表示嘛
You know, as a sign of good faith?

91
00:04:42,781 --> 00:04:45,045
我没有家属
Well, I don't have anybody...

92
00:04:45,083 --> 00:04:47,017
只有汤米
...except for Tommy and my friends.

93
00:04:47,052 --> 00:04:49,282
和这几个朋友

94
00:04:49,321 --> 00:04:52,017
你没有家人？
- You have no family? - Well, I'm workin' on changing that.

95
00:04:52,057 --> 00:04:53,752
我正在努力啊
Mrs. Harmony, we're all the family this little angel's ever gonna need.

96
00:04:53,792 --> 00:04:54,622
哈蒙尼太太

97
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:57,686
这个小天使有我们就够了

98
00:04:59,865 --> 00:05:01,059
我不太舒服
I'm not feeling very well, and this bitch is starting to piss me off.

99
00:05:01,099 --> 00:05:03,567
快被那个小姑娘烦死了

100
00:05:03,602 --> 00:05:05,229
你们继续聊
So while y'all blather on, I'm gonna go outside and get some air.

101
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:07,135
我出去透透气

102
00:05:07,172 --> 00:05:08,469
好的
OK. Um, uh, Reverend, sorry, uh...

103
00:05:08,507 --> 00:05:10,304
牧师，不好意思

104
00:05:10,342 --> 00:05:11,832
她要去透透气
- She's gonna go out and get some air. - Yeah. Given her delicate condition...

105
00:05:11,877 --> 00:05:14,107
怀孕难免会不舒服

106
00:05:14,146 --> 00:05:17,377
给她几分钟喘口气就没事了
She just needs a few minutes to get it together. She'll be OK.

107
00:05:17,416 --> 00:05:18,940
好的
Right...

108
00:06:36,395 --> 00:06:38,363
小妞儿
Hello, Kiddo.

109
00:06:43,034 --> 00:06:45,059
你是怎么找到我的？
- How did you find me? - I'm the man.

110
00:06:45,904 --> 00:06:47,496
我厉害啊

111
00:06:51,276 --> 00:06:53,540
你来这里干嘛？
What are you doin' here?

112
00:06:54,913 --> 00:06:57,381
我来干嘛？
What am I doin'?

113
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:00,013
我
Well...

114
00:07:00,519 --> 00:07:03,647
刚才我在吹笛子
...moment ago I was playin' my flute.

115
00:07:09,895 --> 00:07:11,988
此时此刻
At this moment...

116
00:07:12,931 --> 00:07:15,365
我正在看着这双昏花的老眼
...I'm lookin' at the most beautiful bride these old eyes have ever seen.

117
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,561
这辈子看过最美的新娘

118
00:07:19,337 --> 00:07:21,601
你为什么要来？
- Why are you here? - Last look.

119
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:23,164
见你最后一面

120
00:07:25,544 --> 00:07:27,011
你不会惹事吧？
- Are you gonna be nice? - I've never been nice in my whole life.

121
00:07:27,045 --> 00:07:31,106
我一辈子都在惹事

122
00:07:31,149 --> 00:07:33,083
但这次会尽力
But I'll do my best to be sweet.

123
00:07:33,118 --> 00:07:34,949
安分一点

124
00:07:34,662 --> 00:07:35,663
Hmm.

125
00:07:36,788 --> 00:07:39,256
我早就说过了
I always told you...

126
00:07:39,291 --> 00:07:42,385
你安分起来最讨人喜欢
...your sweet side is you best side.

127
00:07:42,861 --> 00:07:44,556
所以才会
I guess that's why you're the only one who's ever seen it.

128
00:07:44,596 --> 00:07:47,690
只有你看过我安分的一面

129
00:07:49,668 --> 00:07:52,262
你身怀六甲了
- So you got a bun in the oven. - Hmm.

130
00:07:55,373 --> 00:07:57,671
我怀孕了
- I'm knocked up. - Jeez, Louise.

131
00:07:57,709 --> 00:07:59,836
我的老天啊

132
00:07:59,878 --> 00:08:05,077
那个小伙子的动作还真快
That young man of yours sure doesn't believe in wasting time, does he?

133
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:07,775
你见过汤米了吗？
Have you seen Tommy?

134
00:08:10,121 --> 00:08:11,918
穿燕尾服那个？
- Big guy in the tux? - Yes.

135
00:08:11,957 --> 00:08:13,481
对
Then I saw him.

136
00:08:13,525 --> 00:08:16,494
见过了

137
00:08:16,528 --> 00:08:20,123
我喜欢他的发型
I like his hair.

138
00:08:20,165 --> 00:08:22,497
保证要安分喔
You promised you'd be nice.

139
00:08:24,302 --> 00:08:29,001
我只说会尽力，这不算保证
No, I said I'd do my best. That's hardly a promise.

140
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,769
但你言之有理
But you're right.

141
00:08:31,443 --> 00:08:36,176
那个小伙子是做什么的？
What does your young man do for a living?

142
00:08:36,214 --> 00:08:39,308
他在埃尔帕索经营二手唱片行
He owns a used record store here in El Paso.

143
00:08:39,351 --> 00:08:41,979
原来是音乐迷啊
- Ah. Music lover, eh? - He's fond of music.

144
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:45,114
他喜欢音乐

145
00:08:45,156 --> 00:08:46,885
我们不都是吗？
Aren't we all?

146
00:08:51,062 --> 00:08:55,795
你这些日子是在哪一行高就？
And what are you doing for a J-O-B these days?

147
00:08:56,501 --> 00:08:59,061
我在唱片行工作
I work in the record store.

148
00:09:00,272 --> 00:09:01,762
原来如此
Aso.

149
00:09:03,074 --> 00:09:06,237
来龙去脉我忽然都豁然开朗了
It all suddenly seems so clear.

150
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:10,707
你喜欢吗？
- Do you like it? - Yeah. I like it a lot, smartass.

151
00:09:10,749 --> 00:09:14,207
超喜欢的，自命不凡的家伙

152
00:09:14,252 --> 00:09:16,812
可以整天听音乐
I get to listen to music all day...

153
00:09:16,855 --> 00:09:19,881
整天聊音乐，酷得很
...talk about music all day. It's really cool.

154
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:26,390
很适合我女儿成长的一个环境
It's gonna be a great environment for my little girl to grow up in.

155
00:09:28,166 --> 00:09:31,192
不像某些人只会周游列国
As opposed to jetting around the world, killing human beings,

156
00:09:31,236 --> 00:09:33,033
四处杀人

157
00:09:33,071 --> 00:09:36,063
只为了赚进大把钞票
and being paid vast sums of money?

158
00:09:37,776 --> 00:09:39,539
没错
Precisely.

159
00:09:39,578 --> 00:09:42,172
老友啊
Well, my old friend...

160
00:09:42,213 --> 00:09:44,272
人各有志
...to each his own.

161
00:09:44,816 --> 00:09:46,477
不过
However, all cockblockery aside...

162
00:09:46,518 --> 00:09:49,385
废话就不多说了

163
00:09:49,421 --> 00:09:52,788
我倒是想认识那个小伙子
I am looking forward to meeting your young man.

164
00:09:52,824 --> 00:09:56,021
我很想看清楚一点
I happen to be, more or less, particular whom my gal marries.

165
00:09:56,061 --> 00:10:00,430
我的女人要嫁给怎样的人

166
00:10:00,465 --> 00:10:02,456
你想参加婚礼吗？
- You want to come to the wedding? - Only if I can sit on the bride's side.

167
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:05,094
条件是要让我坐在新娘这边

168
00:10:06,204 --> 00:10:09,105
坐我这边会很寂寞
You'll find it a bit lonely on my side.

169
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:12,940
在你身边向来都很寂寞
Your side always was a bit lonely.

170
00:10:12,978 --> 00:10:15,469
但我还是甘之如饴
But I wouldn't sit anywhere else.

171
00:10:17,682 --> 00:10:19,912
你知道吗？
You know...

172
00:10:19,951 --> 00:10:22,511
我梦见你了
...I had the loveliest dream about you...

173
00:10:22,554 --> 00:10:24,954
汤米来了，叫我艾琳
Oh, here's Tommy! Call me Arlene.

174
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:27,080
你就是汤米吧
- You must be Tommy! - Uh-huh.

175
00:10:27,125 --> 00:10:29,616
艾琳经常提到你
Arlene's told me so much about you.

176
00:10:29,661 --> 00:10:31,026
你还好吧？
- Honey, you OK? - Oh, I'm fine.

177
00:10:31,062 --> 00:10:32,495
我很好
Tommy, I'd like you to meet my father.

178
00:10:32,530 --> 00:10:35,124
汤米，他是我爸

179
00:10:36,167 --> 00:10:38,362
天哪
Oh, my God!

180
00:10:38,403 --> 00:10:40,303
天哪，太好了
Oh, my God, this is great!

181
00:10:40,338 --> 00:10:42,636
很高兴能见到你
I'm so glad to meet you, sir... uh, Dad.

182
00:10:42,674 --> 00:10:43,641
爸爸
The name's Bill.

183
00:10:43,675 --> 00:10:45,267
我叫比尔

184
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:47,870
很荣幸能见到你比尔
Well, it's great to meet you... Bill.

185
00:10:47,912 --> 00:10:50,278
艾琳说你不能来
- Arlene told me you couldn't make it. - Surprise.

186
00:10:50,315 --> 00:10:51,213
惊喜
That's my pop for ya. Always full of surprises.

187
00:10:51,249 --> 00:10:52,716
我爸就是这样

188
00:10:52,751 --> 00:10:54,514
爱制造惊喜

189
00:10:54,552 --> 00:10:58,010
说到惊喜
Well, in the surprise department...

190
00:10:58,056 --> 00:11:01,492
真是有其父必有其女
...the apple doesn't fall far from the tree.

191
00:11:01,526 --> 00:11:02,515
你几时来的？
- When did you get in? - Just now.

192
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,857
刚到而已
- Did you come straight from Australia? - Of course.

193
00:11:03,895 --> 00:11:06,159
直接从澳洲过来吗？

194
00:11:06,197 --> 00:11:06,993
对啊
Daddy, I told Tommy that you were in Perth mining for silver, and...

195
00:11:07,032 --> 00:11:10,832
爸，我跟汤米说你去珀斯挖银矿

196
00:11:10,869 --> 00:11:12,803
谁也联络不到你
...no one could reach you.

197
00:11:12,837 --> 00:11:16,637
幸好我还是赶来了
Lucky for us all, that's not the case.

198
00:11:16,675 --> 00:11:18,472
告诉我
So...

199
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:20,273
这是怎么回事？
What's this all about? I've heard of wedding rehearsals,

200
00:11:20,311 --> 00:11:22,404
我听说过婚礼彩排

201
00:11:22,447 --> 00:11:26,884
倒没听过穿着结婚礼服彩排
but I don't believe I've ever heard of a wedding dress rehearsal before.

202
00:11:26,918 --> 00:11:27,976
我们觉得
We thought,

203
00:11:28,019 --> 00:11:31,318
花大钱租礼服，只穿一次太可惜了
"Why pay so much money for a dress you're only going to wear once?"

204
00:11:31,356 --> 00:11:34,382
尤其艾琳穿起来美若天仙
Especially when Arlene looks so goddamn beautiful in it.

205
00:11:34,426 --> 00:11:38,385
我们想多穿几次，捞个够本
So, I think we're going to try to get all the mileage we can out of it.

206
00:11:39,564 --> 00:11:41,225
新郎在婚礼之前
Isn't it supposed to be bad luck forthe groom to see the bride

207
00:11:41,266 --> 00:11:44,565
看到新娘穿着结婚礼服

208
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:45,996
in her wedding dress before the ceremony?

209
00:11:44,602 --> 00:11:47,867
不是很不吉利吗？

210
00:11:47,906 --> 00:11:50,704
我比较铁齿啦
Well, I guess I just believe in living dangerously.

211
00:11:52,377 --> 00:11:54,242
我懂你的意思
I know just what you mean.

212
00:11:54,279 --> 00:11:55,871
小伙子
Son. Some of us have places to be.

213
00:11:55,914 --> 00:11:59,372
我们还有事忙耶

214
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,301
Sure do.

215
00:11:59,417 --> 00:12:01,715
我们要再彩排一次
Look, we got to go through this one more time. So, why don't you have a s...

216
00:12:01,753 --> 00:12:03,846
你先去

217
00:12:03,888 --> 00:12:05,856
天哪
Oh, my God. What am I thinking? You should give her away!

218
00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:07,858
我在想什么？你要陪新娘走红毯

219
00:12:07,892 --> 00:12:11,692
汤米，我爸不喜欢来这一套
Tommy, that's not exactly Daddy's cup oftea.

220
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:14,164
让他和其他宾客坐在一起
I think Father would be much more comfortable

221
00:12:14,199 --> 00:12:16,633
他会比较自在一点
- sitting with the rest of the guests. - Hmm. Really?

222
00:12:16,668 --> 00:12:17,862
真的吗？
That's asking a lot.

223
00:12:17,902 --> 00:12:20,234
我是能免则免啦

224
00:12:21,973 --> 00:12:24,203
那就算了
Oh. OK. Well, forget it.

225
00:12:24,242 --> 00:12:26,608
今晚一起吃饭庆祝一下呢？
But how about we go out to dinner tonight to celebrate?

226
00:12:26,644 --> 00:12:29,272
条件是要由我请客
Only on the condition that I pay for everything.

227
00:12:29,314 --> 00:12:31,908
没问题，我们先去彩排了
Deal. We got to do this now.

228
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:33,417
我可以旁观吗？
- Can I watch? - Absolutely. Have a seat.

229
00:12:33,451 --> 00:12:35,976
当然可以，请坐

230
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:37,715
哪一边是新娘的家属？
- Which is the bride's side? - Right over here.

231
00:12:37,756 --> 00:12:39,690
这一边

232
00:12:42,727 --> 00:12:44,922
母亲，开始吧
Mother, here we go!

233
00:12:46,464 --> 00:12:49,900
关于誓约的部份
Now son, about them vows...

234
00:12:55,907 --> 00:12:58,137
比尔
Bill...

235
00:12:58,176 --> 00:12:59,074
我只是想
- I just want... - You don't owe me a damn thing.

236
00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:02,876
你对我毫无亏欠

237
00:13:02,914 --> 00:13:05,508
既然你决定嫁给他
If he's the man you want...

238
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:08,781
那就去站在他身旁吧
...then go stand by him.

239
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:34,340
我漂亮吗？
- Do I look pretty? - Oh, yes.

240
00:13:34,379 --> 00:13:35,971
漂亮

241
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:48,619
谢谢你
Thank you.

242
00:14:23,728 --> 00:14:25,753
搞什么？
What the hell?

243
00:14:25,797 --> 00:14:28,732
不！比尔！
No! Bill!

244
00:15:07,906 --> 00:15:12,366
你是说她前后杀了88个保镖
You tellin' me she cut her way through 88 bodyguards before she got to O-Ren?

245
00:15:12,410 --> 00:15:13,934
才和御莲正面对决？

246
00:15:13,978 --> 00:15:16,208
不是真的有88个人啦
Nah, there wasn't really 88 of'em.

247
00:15:16,247 --> 00:15:19,080
他们只是自称“疯狂88人组”
They just call themselves "The Crazy 88"

248
00:15:19,117 --> 00:15:20,106
为什么？
- How come? - I don't know.

249
00:15:20,151 --> 00:15:21,140
不知道
I guess they thought it sounded cool.

250
00:15:21,185 --> 00:15:24,348
大概是觉得这个名号很响亮吧

251
00:15:24,389 --> 00:15:25,822
反正
Any how, they all fell under her Hanzo sword.

252
00:15:25,857 --> 00:15:28,553
他们都成了服部半藏的刀下魂

253
00:15:28,593 --> 00:15:30,458
她有服部半藏的刀？
- She got a Hanzo sword? - He made one for her.

254
00:15:30,495 --> 00:15:32,122
他替她铸造的

255
00:15:32,163 --> 00:15:36,065
他不是立下毒誓不再铸刀吗？
Didn't he swear a blood oath to never make another sword?

256
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:37,863
看来
It would appear he has broken it.

257
00:15:37,902 --> 00:15:39,836
他违背誓言了

258
00:15:41,673 --> 00:15:45,473
日本人还真会记恨
Them Japs sure know how to hold a grudge, don't they?

259
00:15:47,845 --> 00:15:49,608
又或许
Or maybe...

260
00:15:49,647 --> 00:15:53,014
你就是会让人恨得牙痒痒的
...you just tend to bring that out in people.

261
00:15:53,051 --> 00:15:55,212
我知道这样问很奇怪
I know this is a ridiculous question before I ask it,

262
00:15:55,253 --> 00:15:57,653
在我说出口之前

263
00:15:57,689 --> 00:16:02,022
你最近还有没有继续
but you haven't, by any chance, kept up with your... swordplay?

264
00:16:04,929 --> 00:16:06,419
我
I, um...

265
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:10,799
好几年前就典当了
I pawned that years ago.

266
00:16:10,835 --> 00:16:14,635
你把服部半藏的刀典当了？
You hocked a Hattori Hanzo sword?

267
00:16:14,672 --> 00:16:16,003
对
Yep.

268
00:16:16,607 --> 00:16:19,041
那是无价之宝耶
It was priceless.

269
00:16:23,982 --> 00:16:26,246
可惜在埃尔帕索不是
Well, not in El Paso, it ain't.

270
00:16:27,151 --> 00:16:30,712
在埃尔帕索只值250美元
In El Paso, I got me $250 for it.

271
00:16:31,856 --> 00:16:37,795
我在脱衣舞酒吧里当保镖
I'm a bouncer in a titty bar, Bill.

272
00:16:37,829 --> 00:16:39,126
若她想找我火拼
If she wants to fight with me, all she's got to do is come to the club

273
00:16:39,163 --> 00:16:43,827
只要来酒吧里惹事就好了

274
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:43,752
and start some shit, and we'll be in a fight.

275
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:47,836
我知道我们很久没有
I know we haven't spoken in some time,

276
00:16:47,872 --> 00:16:50,204
好好聊一下了

277
00:16:50,241 --> 00:16:54,041
我们上次的对话也不太愉快
and the last time we spoke wasn't the most pleasant,

278
00:16:54,078 --> 00:16:58,572
但你最好别再生我的气
but you've got to get over being mad at me,

279
00:16:58,616 --> 00:17:00,982
你该害怕的是她
and start becoming afraid of,

280
00:17:01,019 --> 00:17:02,179
因为她快来了
because she is coming, and she's coming to kill you.

281
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:05,781
她要来杀你

282
00:17:05,823 --> 00:17:07,381
除非你让我帮忙
And unless you accept my assistance, I have no doubt she will succeed.

283
00:17:07,425 --> 00:17:10,792
否则她一定会得逞

284
00:17:19,203 --> 00:17:20,795
我不会推委塞责
I don't dodge guilt, and I don't Jew out of paying my comeuppance.

285
00:17:20,838 --> 00:17:24,103
该承受的报应我都会面对

286
00:17:26,110 --> 00:17:28,044
我们能不能
Can't we just... forget the past?

287
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:30,070
尽释前嫌？

288
00:17:32,383 --> 00:17:34,317
那个女人
That woman...

289
00:17:34,352 --> 00:17:36,912
要报仇的话顺理成章
...deserves her revenge.

290
00:17:41,559 --> 00:17:43,754
而且
And...

291
00:17:43,795 --> 00:17:46,423
我们也死得理所当然
...we deserve to die.

292
00:17:50,735 --> 00:17:53,533
但话又说回来
But then again...

293
00:17:53,571 --> 00:17:55,505
她也一样
...so does she.

294
00:17:58,943 --> 00:18:01,639
所以
So I guess...

295
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:05,080
我们只能静观其变了
...we'll just see.

296
00:18:05,116 --> 00:18:07,209
你说是吗？
Won't we?

297
00:18:11,689 --> 00:18:16,285
第七章 宝拉・舒尔茨的孤坟

298
00:18:43,721 --> 00:18:44,949
你又迟到了
Late again.

299
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:48,787
巴德，你看不懂时钟吗？
Budd, can't you tell time?

300
00:18:48,826 --> 00:18:50,851
反正店里又没人
There ain't nobody in here, man.

301
00:18:50,895 --> 00:18:51,691
是巴德吗？
- Is that Budd? - Yeah.

302
00:18:51,729 --> 00:18:53,162
对
Tell him to get his fucking ass back here!

303
00:18:53,197 --> 00:18:56,394
叫他给我滚进来

304
00:18:56,434 --> 00:18:58,061
好的
OK.

305
00:18:58,102 --> 00:19:01,538
巴德，拉里有话要跟你说
Budd, Larry'd like a word with ya.

306
00:19:05,932 --> 00:19:09,221
吸一口，你就浑然忘我了，宝贝
Take a hit. Be somebody, baby.

307
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:21,100
你找我？
You looking for me?

308
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:30,647
我不知道你之前是在哪家洗车厂打工
I don't know what carwash you worked before you came here

309
00:19:30,691 --> 00:19:32,181
可以让你迟到二十分钟
that let you stroll in 20 minutes late, but it wasn't owned by me

310
00:19:32,226 --> 00:19:35,286
但那家店的老板反正不是我

311
00:19:33,755 --> 00:19:36,383
- and I own a fuckin' carwash. - Do you want me to leave?

312
00:19:35,329 --> 00:19:36,227
要我回避吗？
No, I don't want you to leave. I want you to sit and wait.

313
00:19:36,263 --> 00:19:38,857
不必，坐着等我

314
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:41,525
拉里
Larry...

315
00:19:41,569 --> 00:19:44,003
店里又没人
...there ain't nobody out there, so...

316
00:19:44,975 --> 00:19:48,979
"There's nobody out there, Larry. "

317
00:19:47,708 --> 00:19:50,643
拉里，店里又没人

318
00:19:50,678 --> 00:19:52,578
你想说什么？
What's your point?

319
00:19:52,613 --> 00:19:54,808
这里没你的事吗？
- That you're not needed here? - My point is...

320
00:19:54,849 --> 00:19:57,147
我的重点是…

321
00:19:57,184 --> 00:19:58,947
我是保镖
...I'm the bouncer, and there ain't nobody out there to bounce.

322
00:19:58,986 --> 00:20:01,921
这里没人需要我保护啊

323
00:20:01,956 --> 00:20:05,153
你的意思是？
You're saying that the reason...

324
00:20:05,192 --> 00:20:09,128
你之所以没有做好…
...that you're not doing the job that I'm...

325
00:20:09,163 --> 00:20:10,425
我花钱请你来做的事
...paying you to do is that you don't have a job to do?

326
00:20:10,464 --> 00:20:14,560
是因为你没事可做？

327
00:20:16,036 --> 00:20:16,559
不是啦
- No... - Is that what you're saying?

328
00:20:16,604 --> 00:20:18,333
是这个意思吗？

329
00:20:18,372 --> 00:20:20,499
你想说服我什么？
What are you trying to convince me of, exactly?

330
00:20:20,541 --> 00:20:23,908
你在我这里只是装饰用的？
That you're as useless as an asshole right here?

331
00:20:24,512 --> 00:20:26,673
巴德，这样吧
Well, guess what, buddy.

332
00:20:26,714 --> 00:20:28,181
我觉得
I think... you just fucking convinced me.

333
00:20:28,215 --> 00:20:31,707
你刚才说服了我

334
00:20:32,586 --> 00:20:34,247
我们看看日历
Let's go to the calendar.

335
00:20:34,288 --> 00:20:36,688
看看日历吧
It's calendartime.

336
00:20:36,724 --> 00:20:39,420
巴德该看看日历了
Calendartime for Buddy.

337
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:41,621
好，你明天要上班吗？
- OK. You working tomorrow? - Yeah.

338
00:20:41,662 --> 00:20:43,254
要
Mm. No, you're n... You don't even know whatfucking day you work.

339
00:20:43,297 --> 00:20:44,924
不对

340
00:20:44,965 --> 00:20:47,126
你连哪天要上班都不知道

341
00:20:47,168 --> 00:20:49,636
好，你明天没班，星期三才要来
Here. You're notworking tomorrow.

342
00:20:49,670 --> 00:20:52,195
好了
You're working Wednesday. Here you are. There you go.

343
00:20:52,239 --> 00:20:53,638
星期四要上班吗？
- Workin' Thursday? - Yeah.

344
00:20:53,674 --> 00:20:54,231
要
I don't think so. Friday.

345
00:20:54,275 --> 00:20:56,436
不必吧

346
00:20:56,477 --> 00:20:58,570
星期五呢？

347
00:20:58,612 --> 00:21:00,910
上面有你的名字
I d... There's your name.

348
00:21:00,948 --> 00:21:01,471
你说了就算
- If you say so. - There used to be your name. OK?

349
00:21:01,515 --> 00:21:03,847
本来有你的名字

350
00:21:03,884 --> 00:21:07,183
星期六本来有你的名字
- Saturday. There used to be your name. - Oh.

351
00:21:07,221 --> 00:21:09,246
你星期一要
Uh, Monday...

352
00:21:09,290 --> 00:21:10,518
就这样，如何？
Here. How about that?

353
00:21:10,558 --> 00:21:14,517
非得让你赚不到钱，才算给你教训
Fuckin' with your cash is the only thing you kids seem to understand. OK?

354
00:21:14,562 --> 00:21:16,655
是吗？

355
00:21:16,697 --> 00:21:18,961
你回家去等我的电话
Now, I want you to go home till I call you.

356
00:21:18,999 --> 00:21:21,832
没等到就不必来了
Till I call you.

357
00:21:21,869 --> 00:21:26,863
走之前去找火箭，她有事要你做
Before you leave, talk to Rocket. She's got a job for you to do.

358
00:21:26,907 --> 00:21:29,876
还有
And...

359
00:21:29,910 --> 00:21:32,606
那顶帽子
...the hat.

360
00:21:32,646 --> 00:21:35,080
他妈的烂帽子
That fuckin' hat.

361
00:21:36,150 --> 00:21:38,744
他妈的烂帽子
That fucking...

362
00:21:38,786 --> 00:21:41,482
要我讲几次？
How many times have I told you,

363
00:21:41,522 --> 00:21:44,514
不准戴那顶帽子来上班
don't wear that fucking hat here? How many?

364
00:21:44,558 --> 00:21:46,253
要讲几次？

365
00:21:50,164 --> 00:21:52,064
客人都戴帽子啊
Customers wear hats.

366
00:21:52,099 --> 00:21:54,294
我不是客人的老板
Well, I'm not the boss of the customers.

367
00:21:54,335 --> 00:21:56,701
我是你的老板
I'm the boss of you. And I'm telling you...

368
00:21:56,737 --> 00:21:58,329
告诉你

369
00:21:58,372 --> 00:22:03,833
那顶烂帽子你只准在家里戴
...that I want you to keep that shit-kicker hat at home.

370
00:22:37,478 --> 00:22:40,970
巴德，马桶又塞住了
Yeah. Budd, honey, uh, the toilet is at it again.

371
00:22:41,015 --> 00:22:44,109
粪水流得满地都是
There's shitty water all over the floor.

372
00:22:44,151 --> 00:22:45,641
好的
OK... Rocket.

373
00:22:46,487 --> 00:22:49,081
火箭

374
00:22:49,857 --> 00:22:51,518
我去通马桶
- I'll clean it up. - Mm-hmm.

375
00:26:30,544 --> 00:26:32,444
好了
Now...

376
00:26:32,479 --> 00:26:35,107
你总算冷静下来了吧
...that gentled you down some, didn't it?

377
00:26:44,858 --> 00:26:46,382
很好
Yep.

378
00:26:47,794 --> 00:26:49,659
没人会坏到这种程度
Ain't nobody a badass with a double dose of rock salt dug deep in their tits.

379
00:26:49,696 --> 00:26:51,926
发射了两枪岩盐

380
00:26:51,965 --> 00:26:53,899
正中你的胸部

381
00:26:57,838 --> 00:27:00,272
反正我
Not havin'... tits...

382
00:27:00,307 --> 00:27:05,870
没有

383
00:27:05,913 --> 00:27:08,507
像你这么漂亮
...as fine...

384
00:27:08,549 --> 00:27:10,710
又这么丰满的胸部
...or as big as yours,

385
00:27:11,451 --> 00:27:16,912
很难想像你会有多痛
I can't even imagine how bad that shit must sting.

386
00:27:19,927 --> 00:27:21,656
不过
Yet...

387
00:27:25,299 --> 00:27:28,200
我可不想亲身体验
...I don't want to, neither.

388
00:27:49,723 --> 00:27:51,520
我赢了
I win.

389
00:28:01,721 --> 00:28:04,599
Ugh! Ugh.

390
00:29:03,897 --> 00:29:05,558
比尔？
Bill.

391
00:29:05,599 --> 00:29:08,796
我是他老弟，死贱人
Wrong brother, ya hateful bitch.

392
00:29:08,835 --> 00:29:09,597
巴德
- Budd. - Bingo.

393
00:29:09,636 --> 00:29:12,503
答对了

394
00:29:12,539 --> 00:29:15,201
请问你有何贵干？
And to what do I owe this dubious pleasure?

395
00:29:16,376 --> 00:29:18,571
我刚才逮到了
I just caught me the cowgirl ain't never been caught.

396
00:29:18,612 --> 00:29:20,842
你们一直抓不到的小妞儿

397
00:29:21,815 --> 00:29:23,908
你杀了她吗？
- Did you kill her? - Well, not yet, I ain't.

398
00:29:23,950 --> 00:29:26,145
还没有

399
00:29:26,186 --> 00:29:28,711
只用岩盐射中她而已
I shot her full of rock salt.

400
00:29:28,755 --> 00:29:30,746
她现在温驯得很
She's so gentle right now, I could perform her coup de grace with a rock.

401
00:29:30,791 --> 00:29:34,557
随手拿块石头就能让她安乐死

402
00:29:34,594 --> 00:29:36,755
不废话了
Anywho...

403
00:29:39,866 --> 00:29:43,358
猜猜我手里拿着什么
Guess what I'm holdin' in my hand right now?

404
00:29:43,403 --> 00:29:44,392
什么？
What?

405
00:29:44,438 --> 00:29:49,899
服部半藏全新铸造的武士刀
A brand spankin' new Hattori Hanzo sword.

406
00:29:49,943 --> 00:29:53,242
艾尔，我可以告诉你
And I'm here to tell ya, Elle,

407
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:55,578
什么才叫作锋利
- ... that's what I call sharp. - How much?

408
00:29:55,615 --> 00:29:56,980
多少钱？
Oh, that's hard to say, bein' that it's... priceless and all.

409
00:29:57,017 --> 00:29:59,986
很难说耶

410
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:01,817
因为这是无价之宝

411
00:30:01,855 --> 00:30:03,982
有什么条件？
What's the terms?

412
00:30:04,524 --> 00:30:08,483
你明天一大早就给我滚过来
You get your bony ass down here first thing in the morning...

413
00:30:08,528 --> 00:30:12,624
带着一百万美元的纸钞
...with a million dollars in folding cash...

414
00:30:12,666 --> 00:30:14,964
我就给你
...and I'll give you the greatest sword ever made by a man.

415
00:30:15,001 --> 00:30:18,801
服部半藏亲手铸造的一等名刀

416
00:30:22,376 --> 00:30:24,105
你意下如何？
Now, how do you like the sound of that?

417
00:30:24,144 --> 00:30:25,873
成交了
Sounds like we got a deal.

418
00:30:25,912 --> 00:30:27,777
不过有一个条件
- One condition. - What?

419
00:30:27,814 --> 00:30:28,803
什么条件？
She must suffer to her last breath.

420
00:30:28,849 --> 00:30:30,282
要让她受苦受难

421
00:30:30,317 --> 00:30:32,717
直到咽下最后一口气为止

422
00:30:32,753 --> 00:30:35,119
这个嘛
Well...

423
00:30:35,155 --> 00:30:38,181
亲爱的艾尔
That, Elle darlin'...

424
00:30:38,225 --> 00:30:42,127
我能保证让你如愿以偿
...I can pretty much damn well guarantee.

425
00:30:42,162 --> 00:30:44,027
那我们就明天见了
Then I'll see you in the mornin', millionaire.

426
00:30:44,064 --> 00:30:46,032
百万富翁

427
00:30:46,066 --> 00:30:47,693
没问题
All right.

428
00:31:49,029 --> 00:31:51,224
起床
Wakey, wakey.

429
00:31:51,264 --> 00:31:52,788
吃早餐了
Eggs and bakey.

430
00:32:28,134 --> 00:32:29,829
挖好了
I'm done!

431
00:32:30,537 --> 00:32:32,869
拉我一把
Get me outta this hole!

432
00:32:36,329 --> 00:32:37,664
Good.

433
00:32:47,382 --> 00:32:48,549
Whew.

434
00:33:10,510 --> 00:33:12,478
你看看她的眼神
Whoa, look at those eyes.

435
00:33:12,512 --> 00:33:15,208
可凶猛了
This bitch is furious.

436
00:33:16,716 --> 00:33:19,446
我不是说过了吗？
What did I tell ya?

437
00:33:19,486 --> 00:33:23,081
你很难找到这么漂亮的金发小妞儿
Is she the cutest little blond pussy you ever saw?

438
00:33:23,123 --> 00:33:24,681
对吧？
Or... is she the cutest little blond pussy you ever saw?

439
00:33:24,724 --> 00:33:27,284
很难找到这么漂亮的金发小妞儿

440
00:33:27,327 --> 00:33:30,228
我看过更漂亮的
I seen better.

441
00:33:34,467 --> 00:33:36,594
你有什么话要说吗？
You got anything to say?

442
00:33:38,805 --> 00:33:42,172
白种女人就是喜欢怒而不言
White women call this "the silent treatment. "

443
00:33:42,208 --> 00:33:45,143
其实这样更合我们的意
And we let 'em think we don't like it.

444
00:33:50,016 --> 00:33:52,041
你抓脚，我抓头
You grab the feet, I'll get the head.

445
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:02,331
Hey. Hey. Hey!

446
00:34:03,563 --> 00:34:05,360
真会扭啊
Wiggle worm, you see this?

447
00:34:05,398 --> 00:34:07,525
看见没？

448
00:34:07,567 --> 00:34:10,627
看见了吧？
You see it, don't ya?

449
00:34:11,838 --> 00:34:13,999
这是防身喷雾
That's a can of Mace.

450
00:34:13,676 --> 00:34:16,554
Mm-hmm. No.

451
00:34:15,542 --> 00:34:19,774
不，今晚要活埋你
You're goin' underneath the ground tonight.

452
00:34:19,813 --> 00:34:23,305
就这么决定了
And... that's all there is to it.

453
00:34:26,753 --> 00:34:29,415
我要活埋你
I wanna bury ya.

454
00:34:31,691 --> 00:34:35,491
本来想给你
I was gonna bury ya...

455
00:34:40,133 --> 00:34:42,226
这个当陪葬品
...with this.

456
00:34:45,338 --> 00:34:50,799
但你再这样不好好合作
But if you're gonna act like a horse's ass...

457
00:34:50,844 --> 00:34:54,871
我就要拿这整罐防身喷雾
...I'm gonna spray this whole goddamn can right in your eyeballs!

458
00:34:54,914 --> 00:34:56,609
喷进你的眼睛里

459
00:34:56,650 --> 00:35:00,814
让你两眼灼烧疼痛
I'll burn 'em right outta your fuckin' head.

460
00:35:00,854 --> 00:35:03,687
然后两眼全盲
Then you're gonna be blind...

461
00:35:03,723 --> 00:35:08,160
灼烧疼痛
...and burnin'...

462
00:35:08,194 --> 00:35:10,424
被活埋
...and buried alive.

463
00:35:15,602 --> 00:35:18,298
你打算怎样？
Now, what's it gonna be, sister?

464
00:35:28,715 --> 00:35:30,979
算你识相
That's a wise decision.

465
00:35:43,997 --> 00:35:47,455
你伤了我哥的心，我替他报仇
This is for breakin' my brother's heart.

466
00:39:14,974 --> 00:39:20,173
第八章 白眉的磨难试炼

467
00:39:36,095 --> 00:39:38,689
很久以前
Once upon a time...

468
00:39:38,731 --> 00:39:40,596
在中国大陆
...in China...

469
00:39:41,668 --> 00:39:43,761
据说
...some believe around the year...

470
00:39:43,803 --> 00:39:48,297
在公元1003年左右

471
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:48,219
...one double aught-three,

472
00:39:49,142 --> 00:39:53,636
白莲教的掌门人白眉道长
head priest of the White Lotus Clan, Pai Mei, was walking down a road...

473
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:56,615
走在路上的时候

474
00:39:56,649 --> 00:39:58,014
不知道在沉思什么
...contemplating whatever it is

475
00:39:58,051 --> 00:40:01,145
就是功力高强如白眉的人
that a man of Pai Mei's infinite powers would contemplate -

476
00:40:01,187 --> 00:40:04,918
会沉思的事

477
00:40:04,958 --> 00:40:08,189
换言之，就是天晓得他在想什么
which is another way of saying, "Who knows?" -

478
00:40:09,395 --> 00:40:12,796
此时有个少林武僧走过来
when a Shaolin monk appeared on the road,

479
00:40:12,832 --> 00:40:15,767
正好和他背道而行
traveling in the opposite direction.

480
00:40:15,802 --> 00:40:19,761
少林武僧和白眉擦肩而过时
As the monk and the priest crossed paths...

481
00:40:19,806 --> 00:40:22,036
白眉
...Pai Mei...

482
00:40:22,075 --> 00:40:27,479
怀着高深莫测的宽宏大量
...in a practically unfathomable display of generosity,

483
00:40:27,513 --> 00:40:32,246
向少林武僧微微颔首
gave the monk the slightest of nods.

484
00:40:32,852 --> 00:40:37,846
结果对方没回礼
The nod...

485
00:40:34,932 --> 00:40:36,851
...was not returned.

486
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:42,692
那位少林武僧
Now, was it the intention of the Shaolin monk to insult Pai Mei?

487
00:40:42,729 --> 00:40:46,563
是故意轻蔑白眉？

488
00:40:46,599 --> 00:40:52,060
或者只是没看到他点头示意？
Or did he just fail to see the generous social gesture?

489
00:40:52,105 --> 00:40:54,198
那位少林武僧的动机
The motives of the monk remain unknown.

490
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:56,708
我们不得而知

491
00:40:56,743 --> 00:40:58,973
只知道
What is known...

492
00:40:59,012 --> 00:41:01,446
后果是怎样
...were the consequences.

493
00:41:13,726 --> 00:41:15,489
隔天早上
The next morning, Pai Mei appeared at the Shaolin temple...

494
00:41:15,528 --> 00:41:19,828
白眉来到了少林寺

495
00:41:19,866 --> 00:41:23,267
命令少林寺住持
...and demanded of the temple's head abbot

496
00:41:23,302 --> 00:41:26,567
在他面前自刎谢罪
that he offer Pai Mei his neck to repay the insult.

497
00:41:26,606 --> 00:41:29,905
弥偿他所受的羞辱

498
00:41:29,942 --> 00:41:34,345
起先少林寺住持想安抚白眉
The abbot, at first, tried to console Pai Mei.

499
00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:38,316
结果发现白眉
Only to find Pai Mei was...

500
00:41:38,351 --> 00:41:40,683
根本安抚不了
...inconsolable.

501
00:41:51,431 --> 00:41:53,831
于是展开了
So began...

502
00:41:53,866 --> 00:41:56,835
少林寺大屠杀
...the Massacre of the Shaolin Temple, and all sixty of the monks inside,

503
00:41:56,869 --> 00:41:59,736
寺里的六十名僧侣全数遇害

504
00:41:59,772 --> 00:42:03,299
死在白莲教掌门人的手下
at the fists of the White Lotus.

505
00:42:03,342 --> 00:42:07,176
于是开始谣传起
And... so began the legend...

506
00:42:07,213 --> 00:42:11,616
白眉的五步穿心指
...of Pai Mei's Five-Point-Palm Exploding-Heart Technique.

507
00:42:11,651 --> 00:42:15,678
请问何谓“五步穿心指”？
And what, pray tell, is the Five-Point-Palm

508
00:42:15,721 --> 00:42:17,416
很简单
- Exploding-Heart Technique? - Quite simply,

509
00:42:17,457 --> 00:42:21,450
就是武术界最致命的绝招
the deadliest blow in all of martial arts.

510
00:42:23,296 --> 00:42:26,857
用指尖点你的穴道
He hits you with his fingertips...

511
00:42:26,899 --> 00:42:30,892
点身上的五个不同的穴位
...at five different pressure points on your body...

512
00:42:30,937 --> 00:42:34,896
然后放你走
...and then lets you walk away.

513
00:42:34,941 --> 00:42:37,933
但等你走了五步
But once you've taken five steps...

514
00:42:37,977 --> 00:42:42,073
心脏就会在体内爆开
...your heart explodes inside your body...

515
00:42:42,115 --> 00:42:46,381
瞬间倒地而死
...and you fall to the floor, dead.

516
00:42:46,419 --> 00:42:47,784
他有教你吗？
- Did he teach you that? - No.

517
00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:50,220
没有

518
00:42:50,256 --> 00:42:55,421
他的五步穿心指从不外传
He teaches no one the Five-Point-Palm Exploding-Heart Technique.

519
00:42:55,461 --> 00:42:57,520
说真的
Now...

520
00:42:57,563 --> 00:43:01,363
我一直很欣赏你
...one of the things I've always liked about you...

521
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:04,494
小妞儿
...Kiddo...

522
00:43:04,537 --> 00:43:08,098
你年纪轻轻就聪明过人
...is you appear wise beyond your years.

523
00:43:11,344 --> 00:43:16,111
请容我给你几句忠告
So, allow me to impart a word to the wise:

524
00:43:16,149 --> 00:43:17,639
无论如何
Whatever...

525
00:43:17,683 --> 00:43:20,516
不管白眉说什么
...whatever Pai Mei says, obey.

526
00:43:20,553 --> 00:43:23,113
你都要唯命是从

527
00:43:23,156 --> 00:43:25,716
只要你眼神中略有叛意
If you flash him, even for an instant, a defiant eye, he'll pluck it out.

528
00:43:25,758 --> 00:43:29,091
眼睛就会被他挖出来

529
00:43:29,128 --> 00:43:33,622
若你用美国人的高傲姿态对他
And if you throw any American sass his way...

530
00:43:33,666 --> 00:43:37,796
他会把你的颈背当树枝一样扭断
...he'll snap your back and your neck like they were twigs.

531
00:43:40,339 --> 00:43:42,967
到时候你就呜呼哀哉了
And that will be the story of you.

532
00:44:03,496 --> 00:44:06,090
他愿意收你为徒
He'll accept you as his student.

533
00:44:06,132 --> 00:44:07,326
那你呢？
- What happened to you? - Nothin'.

534
00:44:07,366 --> 00:44:08,196
没事
- Get in a fight? - Friendly contest.

535
00:44:08,234 --> 00:44:09,724
打架了吗？

536
00:44:09,769 --> 00:44:11,396
友谊赛

537
00:44:11,437 --> 00:44:12,904
他为何收我为徒？
Why did he accept me?

538
00:44:12,939 --> 00:44:17,205
因为他一只脚踏进棺材里
Because he's a very, very, very old man.

539
00:44:17,243 --> 00:44:20,508
所有老不死的都一样
And like all rotten bastards...

540
00:44:20,546 --> 00:44:22,605
等到死了
...when they become old, they get lonely.

541
00:44:22,648 --> 00:44:25,173
就会很寂寞

542
00:44:25,885 --> 00:44:29,082
不会影响他的脾气
Which has no effect on their dispositions,

543
00:44:29,121 --> 00:44:33,353
只是这才发现有人作伴的重要
but it does teach them the value of company.

544
00:44:34,338 --> 00:44:36,423
Whew. Oh.

545
00:44:36,596 --> 00:44:38,962
光是再看到这段阶梯
Just seein' those steps again makes me ache.

546
00:44:38,998 --> 00:44:41,933
我身体就凉了半截

547
00:44:41,968 --> 00:44:44,095
你等着享受挑水
You're gonna have a lot of fun

548
00:44:44,136 --> 00:44:47,333
上下这段阶梯的乐趣吧
carrying buckets of water up and down that fucker.

549
00:44:51,611 --> 00:44:53,602
我们何时再相见？
When will I see you again?

550
00:44:53,646 --> 00:44:57,138
那是我最爱的70年代灵魂歌曲
That's the title of my favorite soul song of the seventies.

551
00:44:57,183 --> 00:44:58,241
什么？
- What? - Nothin'.

552
00:44:58,284 --> 00:44:59,444
没事

553
00:45:00,186 --> 00:45:02,654
等他说你学成了为止
When he tells me you're done.

554
00:45:02,688 --> 00:45:04,553
你觉得要多久？
When do you think that might be?

555
00:45:04,590 --> 00:45:07,457
这就要看你的造化了
That, my dearest, depends entirely on you.

556
00:45:07,493 --> 00:45:08,755
记住
Now remember, no sarcasm, no backtalk.

557
00:45:08,794 --> 00:45:11,126
不准嘲讽，不准回嘴

558
00:45:11,163 --> 00:45:13,461
至少第一年要绝对服从
At least not for the first year or so.

559
00:45:13,499 --> 00:45:16,798
先和他熟悉了再说
You're gonna have to let him warm up to you.

560
00:45:16,836 --> 00:45:18,770
他讨厌白人
He hates Caucasians, despises Americans,

561
00:45:18,804 --> 00:45:20,669
鄙视美国人

562
00:45:20,706 --> 00:45:23,971
对女人更是轻蔑不屑
and has nothing but contempt for women.

563
00:45:25,778 --> 00:45:27,803
所以你在这里
So, in your case... it might take a little while.

564
00:45:27,847 --> 00:45:30,315
可能要待上好一阵子

565
00:45:30,349 --> 00:45:31,748
再见
Adiós.

566
00:47:12,484 --> 00:47:14,418
师父
Master...

567
00:47:15,387 --> 00:47:18,083
你的汉语好差
Your Mandarin is lousy.

568
00:47:18,123 --> 00:47:21,718
我一个字也听不懂，而且好刺耳
It causes my ears discomfort.

569
00:47:19,753 --> 00:47:21,380
You bray like an ass!

570
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:24,820
我没要你说话，你就别说
You are not to speak unless spoken to.

571
00:47:24,832 --> 00:47:29,200
你的汉语好呢，还是你的广东话好？
Is it too much to hope - you understand Cantonese?

572
00:47:32,137 --> 00:47:33,798
我的日语很好
I speak Japanese very well-

573
00:47:33,839 --> 00:47:36,904
我没问你日本话，也没问你蒙古话
I didn't ask if you speak Japanese -

574
00:47:36,940 --> 00:47:39,802
我问你会不会说广东话？
I asked if you understand Cantonese?

575
00:47:40,779 --> 00:47:42,406
一点点
A little.

576
00:47:42,447 --> 00:47:47,311
你是来学武的，不是学讲话
You are here to learn the mysteries of Kung Fu, not linguistics.

577
00:47:47,352 --> 00:47:49,513
如果你不懂汉语
If you can't understand me -

578
00:47:49,555 --> 00:47:51,785
就像狗一样
I will communicate with you like I would a dog.

579
00:47:51,823 --> 00:47:56,419
我会斥喝你，命令你，用棍打你
When I yell, when I point, when I beat you with my stick!

580
00:48:00,766 --> 00:48:03,997
你的师父是不是比尔？
Bill is your master, is he not?

581
00:48:04,836 --> 00:48:06,497
是的，是的
Yes, he is.

582
00:48:08,507 --> 00:48:13,503
你师父说过你曾经学过武术
Your master tells me - you're not entirely unschooled.

583
00:48:13,545 --> 00:48:15,706
你学过些什么？
What training do you possess?

584
00:48:15,747 --> 00:48:18,238
我精通虎鹤拳
I am proficient in Tiger-Crane Style,

585
00:48:18,283 --> 00:48:22,481
更精通日本武士道剑术
and I am more than proficient in the exquisite art of the Samurai sword.

586
00:48:23,622 --> 00:48:26,557
哼，日本剑道，开什么玩笑
The exquisite art of the Samurai sword. Don't make me laugh!

587
00:48:26,592 --> 00:48:30,755
你所谓的剑道不值个屁，你就更加笨
Your so-called exquisite art, is only fit for -

588
00:48:31,037 --> 00:48:33,170
你居然敢正视我
Japanese fat heads!

589
00:48:38,606 --> 00:48:41,004
看你的脾气都可以学武
Your anger amuses me. Do you believe you are my match?

590
00:48:41,206 --> 00:48:44,004
你觉得本道的功夫跟你比如何？

591
00:48:44,042 --> 00:48:45,373
不知
No.

592
00:48:45,410 --> 00:48:48,470
你知道本道会杀人吗？
Are you aware I kill at will?

593
00:48:48,610 --> 00:48:49,270
知道
Yes.

594
00:48:50,281 --> 00:48:51,405
那么你是想死咯？
Is it your wish to die?

595
00:48:51,450 --> 00:48:52,439
不
No.

596
00:48:53,885 --> 00:48:55,375
傻瓜
Then you must be stupid...

597
00:48:55,420 --> 00:48:57,445
真是傻瓜
Then you must be stupid... so stupid.

598
00:48:57,489 --> 00:49:01,448
本道好想看看你有多傻
Rise, and let me look at your ridiculous face.

599
00:49:01,893 --> 00:49:03,326
起身
Rise.

600
00:49:07,532 --> 00:49:10,169
亏你还学过虎鹤拳 
So my pathetic friend... Is there anything that you can do well?

601
00:49:10,205 --> 00:49:14,396
刚才走了一百来台阶就在喘了

602
00:49:14,441 --> 00:49:19,205
我看你不单是傻，身体也很虚啊
What's the matter?

603
00:49:16,536 --> 00:49:18,497
Cat got yourtongue?

604
00:49:19,244 --> 00:49:23,146
喔，对了，你会说日本话
- Oh yes, you speak Japanese.

605
00:49:23,181 --> 00:49:25,581
我最恨日本人
I despise the Goddamn Japs!

606
00:49:27,853 --> 00:49:29,582
去兵器架那边
Go to that rack.

607
00:49:37,829 --> 00:49:39,387
拔那把剑
Remove the sword.

608
00:50:05,157 --> 00:50:07,625
我要看下你的武功有多深
Let's see how good you really are.

609
00:50:07,659 --> 00:50:09,889
出招
If...

610
00:50:09,928 --> 00:50:13,386
如果我输给你的话
...you land a single blow,

611
00:50:13,432 --> 00:50:15,764
我干脆拜你为师
I'll bow down and call you master.

612
00:50:29,581 --> 00:50:32,175
你看到我的功夫了吧，试我的脚法
From here you can get an excellent view of my foot.

613
00:50:37,122 --> 00:50:40,988
你的剑术只是一般入门的水平
Your swordsmanship - is amateur at best.

614
00:50:54,473 --> 00:50:58,840
残废也比你强
Your so-called kung-fu - is really - quite pathetic.

615
00:51:02,781 --> 00:51:05,875
我已经给你机会显示一下你的武功
I asked you to demonstrate - what you know - and you did...

616
00:51:05,917 --> 00:51:07,214
我看到了

617
00:51:07,252 --> 00:51:09,482
你一点都不会
Not a goddamn thing!

618
00:51:09,521 --> 00:51:11,989
现在我要你以虎鹤拳
Let's see yourTiger Crane - match my Eagle's Claw.

619
00:51:12,023 --> 00:51:14,253
和我的鹰爪拳比试一下

620
00:52:10,482 --> 00:52:12,382
你和其他美国女人一样
Like all Yankee women...

621
00:52:12,417 --> 00:52:14,282
只知道在餐馆点菜
...all you can do is order in restaurants and spend a man's money.

622
00:52:14,319 --> 00:52:16,082
花男人的钱

623
00:52:16,988 --> 00:52:18,812
痛吗？我问你呢？
Excruciating - isn't it?

624
00:52:18,857 --> 00:52:20,415
痛
Yes!

625
00:52:21,460 --> 00:52:23,257
你相不相信我
If it was my wish...

626
00:52:23,295 --> 00:52:24,853
随时能砍下你的手臂
...I could chop your arm off.

627
00:52:24,896 --> 00:52:26,727
不，求求你不要！
No, please don't!

628
00:52:27,969 --> 00:52:30,498
你相不相信我想怎样就怎样
It's my arm now. I can do what I please.

629
00:52:30,569 --> 00:52:34,798
如果你不想我砍你的手，动手
If you can stop me - I suggest you try.

630
00:52:34,840 --> 00:52:37,240
我不行
I can't.

631
00:52:37,275 --> 00:52:39,209
打不过吧？
Because you're helpless?

632
00:52:39,244 --> 00:52:41,041
对
Yes.

633
00:52:42,647 --> 00:52:45,241
你以前试过这种滋味吗？
Have you ever felt this before?

634
00:52:45,283 --> 00:52:46,409
没有
No.

635
00:52:46,451 --> 00:52:50,647
你的功夫和我比，简直是班门弄斧
Compared to me - you're as helpless as a worm fighting an eagle?

636
00:52:50,689 --> 00:52:52,554
对
YES!

637
00:52:54,226 --> 00:52:55,693
现在开始
THAT'S THE BEGINNING!

638
00:53:00,665 --> 00:53:05,030
你想不想学，我刚才和你打的这套拳？
Is it your wish to possess this kind of power?

639
00:53:05,871 --> 00:53:07,463
想
Yes!

640
00:53:09,107 --> 00:53:11,337
从明天开始你要练武
Your training will begin - tomorrow.

641
00:53:11,376 --> 00:53:13,537
记住

642
00:53:20,719 --> 00:53:22,880
你的手臂属于我
Since your arm now belongs to me...

643
00:53:22,921 --> 00:53:25,913
我会将它练得结实
...I want it strong.

644
00:53:25,957 --> 00:53:28,858
你能不能做到像我这样？
Can you do that?

645
00:53:28,894 --> 00:53:30,691
可以，但那么近没办法
I can, but not that close.

646
00:53:30,729 --> 00:53:32,526
那就是不行了
Then you can't do it.

647
00:53:33,164 --> 00:53:38,058
如果敌人离你的身体只有三寸
What if your enemy - is three inches in front of you...

648
00:53:38,103 --> 00:53:40,469
你怎么对付他？
...What do you do then...

649
00:53:40,505 --> 00:53:43,133
抱头鼠窜
...Curl into a ball...

650
00:53:43,174 --> 00:53:46,143
还是用拳打穿他？
...or do you put your FIST through him?

651
00:53:46,177 --> 00:53:47,542
现在开始
Now begin.

652
00:54:19,177 --> 00:54:21,543
练拳头不应该是你怕木头
It's the wood that should fear your hand -

653
00:54:21,580 --> 00:54:23,878
应该是木头怕你
- not the otherway around.

654
00:54:23,915 --> 00:54:26,349
你之所以打不穿木头
No wonder you can't do it - you acquiesce to defeat -

655
00:54:26,384 --> 00:54:30,350
是因为你用手之前已经认输了

656
00:54:28,682 --> 00:54:30,058
- before you even begin.

657
00:56:18,396 --> 00:56:21,763
如果你像狗一样吃东西
If you want to eat like a dog...

658
00:56:21,800 --> 00:56:24,234
我就让你像狗一样住外面
You can live and sleep outside like a dog.

659
00:56:26,471 --> 00:56:29,872
如果你想像人一样的话
If you want to live and sleep like a human...

660
00:56:29,908 --> 00:56:31,739
把筷子拿起来
...pick up those sticks.

661
01:00:02,453 --> 01:00:05,354
快，你这混蛋
Come on, you bitch.

662
01:00:46,898 --> 01:00:49,526
好了，白眉
OK, Pai Mei.

663
01:00:51,569 --> 01:00:54,197
看我的吧
Here I come.

664
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:05,494
请给我一杯水
May I have a glass of water, please?

665
01:03:08,072 --> 01:03:12,566
第九章 艾尔与我

666
01:05:44,028 --> 01:05:46,496
那是德州式的葬礼？
- So that's a Texas funeral? - Yep.

667
01:05:46,530 --> 01:05:47,861
对

668
01:05:49,233 --> 01:05:51,098
巴德，我真服了你
I have to give it to ya, Budd.

669
01:05:51,135 --> 01:05:54,161
那种死法真要命
That's a pretty fucked up way to die.

670
01:05:54,205 --> 01:05:56,673
墓碑上写的是什么名字？
What's the name on the grave she's buried under?

671
01:05:57,541 --> 01:05:59,168
宝拉
Paula...

672
01:06:01,012 --> 01:06:02,604
舒尔茨
...Schultz.

673
01:06:08,386 --> 01:06:10,013
可以看看武士刀吗？
Can I look at the sword?

674
01:06:10,054 --> 01:06:13,421
红色行李箱装的是我的钱吗？
That's my money right there in that red bag, isn't it?

675
01:06:13,457 --> 01:06:15,448
没错
It sure is.

676
01:06:16,227 --> 01:06:18,821
那武士刀就是你的了
Well then, it's your sword now.

677
01:06:35,046 --> 01:06:37,446
这就是服部半藏铸的刀啊

678
01:06:37,982 --> 01:06:39,847
你说什么？
What's that you said?

679
01:06:39,884 --> 01:06:42,512
这就是服部半藏铸的刀啊
So this is a Hattori Hanzo sword.

680
01:06:42,553 --> 01:06:44,748
那是服部半藏铸的没错
That's a Hanzo sword, all right.

681
01:06:44,789 --> 01:06:49,158
比尔说你以前也有他铸的刀
Bill tells me you once had one of these of your own.

682
01:06:49,193 --> 01:06:50,820
对，曾经有过
Yeah, once.

683
01:06:51,429 --> 01:06:54,262
和这把刀比起来呢？
Yeah? How does this one compare to that?

684
01:07:03,140 --> 01:07:08,134
若想比较服部半藏铸的刀
If you're gonna compare a Hanzo sword...

685
01:07:08,179 --> 01:07:12,047
就要和其他那些
...you compare it to every other sword ever made -

686
01:07:12,083 --> 01:07:14,244
不是服部半藏
wasn't made - by Hattori Hanzo.

687
01:07:14,285 --> 01:07:16,583
铸造的武士刀比较

688
01:07:25,096 --> 01:07:27,690
拿去，喝喝看
Here you go. Wrap your lips around that.

689
01:07:37,441 --> 01:07:38,806
你
So...

690
01:07:40,077 --> 01:07:43,205
现在的心情如何？
...which "R" are you filled with?

691
01:07:43,247 --> 01:07:44,680
什么？
What?

692
01:07:47,918 --> 01:07:49,886
有人说
They say...

693
01:07:49,920 --> 01:07:54,289
人老了以后的头号敌人
...the number one killer...

694
01:07:52,401 --> 01:07:54,236
...of old people...

695
01:07:54,325 --> 01:07:56,225
就是退休
...is retirement.

696
01:07:57,728 --> 01:07:59,593
每个人都要工作
People got a job to do, they tend to live a little bit longer so they can do it.

697
01:07:59,630 --> 01:08:01,188
为了工作

698
01:08:01,232 --> 01:08:04,258
才会活得更久一点

699
01:08:05,436 --> 01:08:07,700
我一直觉得
I've always figured that...

700
01:08:07,738 --> 01:08:10,764
战士和他们的敌人
...warriors and their enemies...

701
01:08:10,808 --> 01:08:13,038
也是这样的关系
...share the same relationship.

702
01:08:14,311 --> 01:08:19,271
既然你不必再和敌人短兵相接了
So now that you're not gonna have to face your enemy no more

703
01:08:16,675 --> 01:08:19,428
on the battlefield...

704
01:08:20,317 --> 01:08:24,378
现在的心情如何？
...which "R" ya filled with?

705
01:08:25,322 --> 01:08:27,950
松了一口气？
Relief...

706
01:08:29,727 --> 01:08:32,491
还是遗憾？
...or regret?

707
01:08:33,197 --> 01:08:35,324
两种都有吧
- A little bit of both. - Horseshit.

708
01:08:35,366 --> 01:08:37,266
胡扯

709
01:08:38,769 --> 01:08:42,261
我当然知道两种都有
I'm sure you do feel a little bit of both.

710
01:08:42,306 --> 01:08:45,537
但我相信其中一种感觉
But I know damn well that you feel one...

711
01:08:45,576 --> 01:08:48,374
一定比另一种感觉更强烈
...more than you feel the other.

712
01:08:48,412 --> 01:08:51,040
我要问的是
And the question was: Which one is it?

713
01:08:51,081 --> 01:08:53,174
哪一种？

714
01:08:54,685 --> 01:08:56,414
遗憾
Regret.

715
01:08:57,521 --> 01:08:59,989
那个小妞儿真有一套
You know, you gotta hand it to the ol' girl.

716
01:09:00,024 --> 01:09:04,859
没看过有人比她更让比尔着迷
I never saw anybody buffalo Bill the way she buffaloed Bill.

717
01:09:04,895 --> 01:09:07,159
比尔觉得她聪明绝顶
Bill thought she was so damn smart.

718
01:09:07,198 --> 01:09:09,496
我早就想告诉他了
And I tried to tell him...

719
01:09:09,533 --> 01:09:12,161
她只是在金发小妞儿里算聪明的
...she was just smart for a blond.

720
01:09:31,789 --> 01:09:33,313
谢了
Thanks a bunch.

721
01:09:45,890 --> 01:09:47,349
All right.

722
01:10:17,588 --> 01:10:19,381
Mmm.

723
01:10:19,436 --> 01:10:21,370
抱歉
I'm sorry, Budd.

724
01:10:21,405 --> 01:10:23,703
我太失礼了
That was rude of me, wasn't it?

725
01:10:23,741 --> 01:10:26,369
巴德，这位是我的朋友
Budd, I'd like to introduce my friend, the black mamba.

726
01:10:26,410 --> 01:10:28,037
黑曼巴

727
01:10:28,078 --> 01:10:31,411
黑曼巴，这位是巴德
Black mamba, this is Budd.

728
01:10:31,448 --> 01:10:33,211
我在买下这条蛇之前
You know, before I picked that little fella up,

729
01:10:33,250 --> 01:10:35,650
还上网查过资料
I looked him up on the Internet.

730
01:10:35,686 --> 01:10:38,450
黑曼巴非常特别
Fascinating creature, the black mamba.

731
01:10:39,590 --> 01:10:40,784
你听听看
Listen to this:

732
01:10:45,563 --> 01:10:49,192
非洲有句俗话说
"In Africa, the saying goes,

733
01:10:49,233 --> 01:10:50,632
在丛林里会被大象踩死
"'In the bush, an elephant can kill you, a leopard can kill you,

734
01:10:50,668 --> 01:10:52,067
会被豹咬死

735
01:10:52,102 --> 01:10:54,627
也会被黑曼巴毒死
"'and a black mamba can kill you. But only with the mamba,

736
01:10:54,672 --> 01:10:56,264
但只有黑曼巴

737
01:10:56,307 --> 01:10:59,401
在非洲从互古至今始终不变
"and this has been true in Africa since the dawn of time, is death sure. '

738
01:10:59,443 --> 01:11:01,274
保证致命

739
01:11:01,312 --> 01:11:03,075
所以又名为…
Hence its handle, 'Death Incarnate. "' Pretty cool, huh?

740
01:11:03,113 --> 01:11:05,673
死神的化身

741
01:11:05,716 --> 01:11:07,047
很酷吧？

742
01:11:08,986 --> 01:11:12,752
其神经毒素是自然界的剧毒之一
"Its neurotoxic venom is one of nature's most effective poisons,

743
01:11:12,790 --> 01:11:16,191
作用于神经系统可能导致瘫痪
"acting on the nervous system, causing paralysis.

744
01:11:16,226 --> 01:11:17,557
黑曼巴的毒液
"The venom of a black mamba can kill a human being in four hours

745
01:11:17,595 --> 01:11:19,790
能在四小时内致人于死

746
01:11:19,830 --> 01:11:22,560
这是在脚踝或拇指被咬的情况下
"if, say, bitten on the ankle or the thumb.

747
01:11:22,600 --> 01:11:24,295
不过
"However, a bite to the face or torso

748
01:11:24,335 --> 01:11:27,998
被咬到脸部或躯干

749
01:11:26,282 --> 01:11:29,994
can bring death from paralysis within 20 minutes. "

750
01:11:28,038 --> 01:11:29,699
二十分钟内就会瘫痪至死

751
01:11:29,740 --> 01:11:33,301
这段你要仔细听因为和你有关
Now, you should listen to this, 'cause this concerns you.

752
01:11:34,912 --> 01:11:37,938
咬一口注入的毒液量
"The amount of venom that can be delivered from a single bite

753
01:11:37,982 --> 01:11:41,110
就能让人回天乏术了
can be gargantuan."

754
01:11:41,151 --> 01:11:43,847
我很喜欢“回天乏术”这个成语
You know, I've always liked that word, "gargantuan."

755
01:11:43,887 --> 01:11:47,015
只是苦无机会可以使用
I so rarely have an opportunity to use it in a sentence.

756
01:11:47,691 --> 01:11:50,091
如不即刻施打抗毒血清
"If not treated quickly with antivenom,

757
01:11:50,127 --> 01:11:52,925
十至十五毫克即可致人于死
"ten to 15 milligrams can be fatal to human beings.

758
01:11:52,963 --> 01:11:55,693
但黑曼巴咬一口
"However, the black mamba can deliver

759
01:11:55,733 --> 01:12:01,228
能注入一百至四百毫克的毒液
as much as 100 to 400 milligrams of venom from a single bite. "

760
01:12:03,874 --> 01:12:06,809
现在
Now...

761
01:12:06,844 --> 01:12:11,178
在你垂死痛苦挣扎的最后几分钟
...in these last agonizing minutes of life you have left,

762
01:12:11,215 --> 01:12:15,481
我要仔细回答你刚才的问题
let me answer that question you asked earlier more thoroughly.

763
01:12:18,122 --> 01:12:20,613
此时此刻
Right at this moment...

764
01:12:20,658 --> 01:12:25,994
我最强烈的感觉是遗憾
...the biggest "R" I feel is regret.

765
01:12:26,030 --> 01:12:27,622
遗憾
Regret that maybe the greatest warrior I have ever met

766
01:12:27,665 --> 01:12:31,999
可能是我毕生最强悍的劲敌

767
01:12:32,036 --> 01:12:33,663
居然会死在
met her end at the hands of a bushwhackin', scrub,

768
01:12:33,704 --> 01:12:36,867
像你这种下三滥

769
01:12:36,907 --> 01:12:41,367
卑鄙无耻小人的手上
alkie, piece of shit like you.

770
01:12:44,048 --> 01:12:47,017
假你之手太侮辱她了
That woman deserved better.

771
01:13:30,494 --> 01:13:33,190
比尔
Bill...

772
01:13:33,230 --> 01:13:35,721
我有坏消息
...I have some tragic news.

773
01:13:36,400 --> 01:13:38,732
你弟弟死了
Your brother's dead.

774
01:13:39,470 --> 01:13:41,870
我很遗憾，宝贝
I am so sorry, baby.

775
01:13:42,473 --> 01:13:45,738
她在屋里放了黑曼巴
She put a black mamba in his camper.

776
01:13:45,776 --> 01:13:48,802
我替你报了仇，她也死了
I got her, sweetie. She's dead.

777
01:13:50,781 --> 01:13:52,612
这么说吧
Let me put it this way:

778
01:13:52,649 --> 01:13:54,844
每当你想念她时
You ever start feeling sentimental, go to Barstow, California.

779
01:13:54,885 --> 01:13:57,115
就去加州的巴尔斯托

780
01:13:57,154 --> 01:14:01,022
到那里先去当地的花店买一束花
When you get here, walk into a florist and buy a bunch of flowers.

781
01:14:01,058 --> 01:14:02,719
带着那束花
Take those flowers to Huntington Cemetery

782
01:14:02,760 --> 01:14:05,786
去富勒与瓜达卢普的亨廷顿墓园

783
01:14:04,314 --> 01:14:08,485
on Fuller and Guadalupe, look for the headstone marked "Paula Schultz,"

784
01:14:05,829 --> 01:14:08,593
找到宝拉・舒尔茨的墓碑

785
01:14:08,632 --> 01:14:10,759
把花放在坟墓上
and lay them on the grave.

786
01:14:10,801 --> 01:14:14,168
因为在坟墓里长眠的人
'Cause you will be standing at the final resting place of Beatrix Kiddo.

787
01:14:14,204 --> 01:14:16,900
正是比阿特丽克斯小妞儿

788
01:14:16,940 --> 01:14:18,100
马蒂・奇斯卓斯尔？
- Marty Kitrosser? - Here.

789
01:14:18,142 --> 01:14:18,904
到
- Melanie Harrhouse? - Here.

790
01:14:18,942 --> 01:14:20,204
梅兰妮・哈尔豪斯？

791
01:14:20,244 --> 01:14:20,869
到
- Beatrix Kiddo? - Here.

792
01:14:20,911 --> 01:14:22,276
比阿特丽克斯小妞儿？

793
01:14:22,312 --> 01:14:23,677
到

794
01:14:23,714 --> 01:14:27,150
我四个小时就到了
Look... I can be there in about four hours.

795
01:14:27,184 --> 01:14:29,584
你要我过去吗？
Do you want me to come over?

796
01:14:29,620 --> 01:14:32,851
不，如果你要，宝贝，我过去陪你
No, no, no. You need me, baby, I'm there.

797
01:14:35,826 --> 01:14:38,624
好，我现在就出发
OK. I'm leaving now.

798
01:14:38,662 --> 01:14:41,688
你去抽根大麻，我马上到
You go smoke some pot or somethin'. I'll be there soon.

799
01:15:43,455 --> 01:15:45,290
Ugh.

800
01:15:45,329 --> 01:15:46,591
恶心
Gross.

801
01:16:58,405 --> 01:16:59,823
Hi-ya!

802
01:17:10,113 --> 01:17:13,571
献给我的弟弟，巴德 我唯一爱的人
"To my brother, Budd. The only man I ever loved. Bill. "

803
01:17:13,984 --> 01:17:14,973
比尔赠

804
01:17:26,363 --> 01:17:27,694
那是什么？
What's that?

805
01:17:29,967 --> 01:17:33,095
巴德的服部半藏武士刀
Budd's Hanzo sword.

806
01:17:33,136 --> 01:17:35,570
他说拿去典当了
He said he pawned it.

807
01:17:35,605 --> 01:17:38,733
想必他是骗你的了
Guess that makes him a liar now, don't it?

808
01:17:42,446 --> 01:17:44,107
艾尔
- Elle? - Bea.

809
01:17:44,147 --> 01:17:45,910
比阿特丽克斯

810
01:17:45,949 --> 01:17:49,112
有件事我一直很好奇
Somethin' I've always been curious about.

811
01:17:49,152 --> 01:17:52,781
算是咱们女孩间的秘密吧
Just between us girls...

812
01:17:52,823 --> 01:17:53,915
你对白眉说了什么
...what did you say to Pai Mei to make him snatch out your eye?

813
01:17:53,957 --> 01:17:57,393
他居然戳瞎了你一只眼睛？

814
01:17:57,673 --> 01:18:00,342
Ow!

815
01:18:01,131 --> 01:18:04,897
我骂他可怜的老不死
I called him a miserable old fool.

816
01:18:04,680 --> 01:18:09,726
Ooh. Bad idea.

817
01:18:07,237 --> 01:18:09,137
噢，馊主意

818
01:18:09,740 --> 01:18:11,901
你知道我做了什么吗？
Know what I did?

819
01:18:11,942 --> 01:18:15,742
我杀了那可怜的老不死
I killed that miserable old fool.

820
01:18:17,714 --> 01:18:19,272
鱼头好不好吃啊
How do you like the fish head, you miserable old fool?

821
01:18:19,316 --> 01:18:20,544
可怜的老不死？
I poisoned his fish heads.

822
01:18:20,584 --> 01:18:23,178
我在他的鱼头里下毒

823
01:18:23,220 --> 01:18:27,054
艾尔，你这条没人性的狗
Elle, you treacherous dog.

824
01:18:31,294 --> 01:18:33,558
我一定会
I - give - you - my -word -

825
01:18:33,597 --> 01:18:35,064
我告诉他
And I told him,

826
01:18:35,098 --> 01:18:39,156
“对我来说，你这老不死的话
"To me, the word of an old fool like you

827
01:18:39,571 --> 01:18:42,435
一文不值”
is worth less than nothing. "

828
01:18:48,045 --> 01:18:49,945
没错
That's right.

829
01:18:49,980 --> 01:18:52,073
我杀了你师父
I killed your master.

830
01:18:52,115 --> 01:18:54,549
现在我要杀了你
And now I'm gonna kill you, too.

831
01:18:54,584 --> 01:18:57,417
用你随身的武士刀
With your own sword, no less.

832
01:18:57,454 --> 01:18:59,945
再过不了多久
Which, in the very immediate future, will become my sword.

833
01:18:59,990 --> 01:19:03,949
这把刀就是我的了

834
01:19:05,829 --> 01:19:08,093
婊子
Bitch...

835
01:19:08,131 --> 01:19:10,656
你马上就玩完了
...you don't have a future.

836
01:19:58,251 --> 01:20:01,379
Fucking bitch!

837
01:20:00,117 --> 01:20:01,550
我看不见！

838
01:20:04,049 --> 01:20:05,926
Fucking bitch!

839
01:20:06,923 --> 01:20:08,515
臭婊子！

840
01:20:09,926 --> 01:20:11,791
我要杀了你！

841
01:20:14,559 --> 01:20:18,522
I'll kill you! You're fuckin' dead!

842
01:20:20,670 --> 01:20:22,570
婊子！
You bitch! You bitch!

843
01:20:24,240 --> 01:20:26,037
婊子！

844
01:20:26,075 --> 01:20:27,542
我要杀了你！你他妈的死定了！

845
01:20:27,577 --> 01:20:29,272
走着瞧！
I'll fucking kill you, you bitch!

846
01:20:29,312 --> 01:20:31,109
我要杀了你！

847
01:20:32,315 --> 01:20:33,509
你在哪里？
Oh, I'll get you!

848
01:20:33,550 --> 01:20:35,450
我们走着瞧！

849
01:20:35,485 --> 01:20:40,184
你在哪里？等着接招吧！

850
01:20:37,123 --> 01:20:39,751
I'm gonna...

851
01:20:40,223 --> 01:20:41,383
你死定了！
Where are you? Lemme fuckin' at you!

852
01:20:41,424 --> 01:20:43,119
你死定了！

853
01:20:43,159 --> 01:20:46,822
我要杀了你这个…你在哪

854
01:20:45,173 --> 01:20:48,844
Where are you? I'm coming, you fucking bitch!

855
01:20:46,863 --> 01:20:48,797
可恶！该死的婊子

856
01:20:48,832 --> 01:20:50,231
该死的…
You're fucking dead! You're dead!

857
01:20:53,932 --> 01:20:57,644
Oh... shit!

858
01:21:16,585 --> 01:21:18,954
最终章 面对面

859
01:22:24,655 --> 01:22:26,623
和大多数从小不知道他们父亲的人一样
Like most men who never knew their father,

860
01:22:27,024 --> 01:22:29,515
比尔喜欢有长者风范的人
Bill collected father figures.

861
01:22:29,961 --> 01:22:34,091
第一个就是埃斯特班・维埃欧
The first was Esteban Vihaio.

862
01:22:34,131 --> 01:22:35,792
埃斯特班以前是皮条客
Esteban was a pimp and a friend of Bill's mother.

863
01:22:35,833 --> 01:22:36,268
也是比尔母亲的朋友
He ran a brothel in Acuna, Mexico, for over 50 years.

864
01:22:36,268 --> 01:22:38,600
他在墨西哥阿库纳

865
01:22:38,637 --> 01:22:40,400
经营妓院五十几年

866
01:22:40,439 --> 01:22:42,703
他的保镖团“阿库纳小子”
His army, the Acuna Boys,

867
01:22:42,741 --> 01:22:45,608
清一色都是没爹的妓女后代
made up of the fatherless offspring of his whores, ran Acuna.

868
01:22:45,644 --> 01:22:47,305
在阿库纳占地为王

869
01:22:47,346 --> 01:22:52,784
阿库纳小子都归他管
He ran the Acuna Boys.

870
01:22:52,818 --> 01:22:54,752
如今他高龄八十岁
Now, at the age of 80, it would be this retired gentleman of leisure

871
01:22:54,787 --> 01:22:57,779
这位已经退休的老绅士

872
01:22:57,823 --> 01:23:00,917
可以指引我找到比尔
who could point me in Bill's direction.

873
01:23:02,461 --> 01:23:06,397
埃斯特班・维埃欧先生吗？
Se?or Esteban Vihaio?

874
01:23:06,432 --> 01:23:08,332
是的
Yes.

875
01:23:08,367 --> 01:23:10,232
我可以坐吗？
May I join you?

876
01:23:11,904 --> 01:23:15,670
条件是你要叫我埃斯特班
Only on the condition that you call me Esteban.

877
01:23:15,708 --> 01:23:18,142
我可以坐吗，埃斯特班？
- May I join you, Esteban? - Please.

878
01:23:18,177 --> 01:23:19,735
请坐

879
01:23:23,782 --> 01:23:25,579
美国人吗？
Americana?

880
01:23:25,618 --> 01:23:27,245
对
Yes.

881
01:23:27,286 --> 01:23:30,016
我懂一点点西班牙语
I speak a little Spanish, if you prefer.

882
01:23:30,055 --> 01:23:31,784
不必了
No, no, no, no. I prefer English.

883
01:23:31,824 --> 01:23:33,792
讲英文就好了

884
01:23:33,826 --> 01:23:36,317
我很久没讲英文
I haven't spoken it in a while,

885
01:23:36,362 --> 01:23:39,820
但我很珍惜能有这个机会
but I would relish the opportunity to converse

886
01:23:39,865 --> 01:23:43,130
和此等的美女聊天
with such a pretty companion as yourself.

887
01:23:43,169 --> 01:23:47,265
能和你这种绅士闲谈是我的荣幸
It's my pleasure to be in the company of such a fine gentleman as yourself.

888
01:23:47,306 --> 01:23:50,104
小姐，我要警告你
I must warn you, young lady...

889
01:23:50,142 --> 01:23:56,172
随便夸我几句我就会得寸进尺
...I am susceptible to flattery.

890
01:23:56,215 --> 01:23:58,706
请问有何贵干？
How may I be of service to you?

891
01:24:06,625 --> 01:24:08,957
比尔在哪儿？
Where's Bill?

892
01:24:10,587 --> 01:24:12,922
Ahh.

893
01:24:13,432 --> 01:24:16,265
你是比阿特丽克斯吧
You must be Beatrix.

894
01:24:17,570 --> 01:24:22,337
看得出来比尔看上你哪一点
I can see the attraction.

895
01:24:22,374 --> 01:24:25,605
还记得比尔才五岁时
I remember when Bill was only five years old, I took him to the movies.

896
01:24:25,644 --> 01:24:27,771
我带他去看电影

897
01:24:27,813 --> 01:24:31,579
那是一部拉娜・特纳主演的电影
It was a movie starring Lana Turner.

898
01:24:31,617 --> 01:24:34,085
邮差总按两次铃
The Postman Always Ring Twice, with John Garfields.

899
01:24:34,119 --> 01:24:36,679
男主角是约翰・加菲尔德

900
01:24:36,722 --> 01:24:39,987
每次她出现在荧幕上时
And whenever she would appear on the screen,

901
01:24:40,025 --> 01:24:42,016
比尔就会情不自禁地
Bill would begin compulsively to suck his thumb to an obscene amount.

902
01:24:42,061 --> 01:24:45,656
猛吸他的大拇指

903
01:24:45,698 --> 01:24:48,792
我从那时候就发现这个小子
And I knew from this very moment, this boy was a fool for blonds.

904
01:24:48,834 --> 01:24:51,826
超级迷恋金发小妞儿

905
01:24:56,758 --> 01:24:58,676
Mmm.

906
01:24:58,978 --> 01:25:00,673
你知道的
You know...

907
01:25:00,713 --> 01:25:04,706
迷恋像你这么漂亮的女人
...being a fool for a woman such as yourself...

908
01:25:04,750 --> 01:25:07,776
绝对是明智之举
...is always the right thing to do.

909
01:25:10,155 --> 01:25:11,986
若我还在经营妓院时
If we had met when I was back in business...

910
01:25:12,024 --> 01:25:14,993
就认识了你

911
01:25:15,027 --> 01:25:16,551
你一定会是…
...you would have been my number one lady.

912
01:25:16,595 --> 01:25:19,587
我妓院里的大红牌

913
01:25:22,167 --> 01:25:23,964
我受宠若惊
- Well, I'm flattered. - You goddamn well better be.

914
01:25:24,003 --> 01:25:26,233
最好是…

915
01:25:28,173 --> 01:25:32,667
这辆车我听说你开的是货车
This... I heard you were driving a truck.

916
01:25:32,711 --> 01:25:35,646
我那辆猫咪小车挂了
My Pussy Wagon died on me.

917
01:25:35,681 --> 01:25:37,808
猫咪死了
The Pussy died. Hmm.

918
01:25:41,687 --> 01:25:44,781
比尔一枪打中你的头吗？
Bill shot you in the head, no?

919
01:25:44,823 --> 01:25:46,518
对
- Yes. - Hmm.

920
01:25:48,360 --> 01:25:51,386
换作是我就会好心一点
I would have been much nicer.

921
01:25:51,430 --> 01:25:54,558
我只会割毁你的容貌
I would have just cut your face.

922
01:25:56,669 --> 01:25:59,934
请你海涵
You must forgive me.

923
01:25:59,972 --> 01:26:01,872
陪我喝一杯吧
Please... you have a drink with me.

924
01:26:04,476 --> 01:26:06,671
克拉丽塔
Clara!

925
01:26:10,215 --> 01:26:11,739
来了
Coming.

926
01:26:14,620 --> 01:26:16,212
两杯龙舌兰
Dos a?ejo.

927
01:26:18,757 --> 01:26:21,157
擦一下(西班牙语)

928
01:26:28,901 --> 01:26:30,425
谢谢(西班牙语)
Gracias.

929
01:26:35,941 --> 01:26:38,774
刚才说到哪儿了？
What were we talking about?

930
01:26:45,150 --> 01:26:46,777
比尔
Bill.

931
01:26:48,987 --> 01:26:50,955
比尔在哪儿？
- Where's Bill? - Where's Bill?

932
01:26:50,989 --> 01:26:53,856
比尔在哪？

933
01:26:52,790 --> 01:26:54,542
Yeah. Hmm.

934
01:26:55,661 --> 01:26:58,027
比尔在四季别墅
Bill is at the Villa Quatro, on the road to Salina.

935
01:26:58,063 --> 01:27:01,089
就在往萨莱纳的路上

936
01:27:01,133 --> 01:27:03,601
我画张地图给你
I will draw you a map.

937
01:27:05,003 --> 01:27:07,767
我把比尔当成自己的儿子
Bill is like a son to me.

938
01:27:09,041 --> 01:27:11,566
你知道我为何要帮你吗？
- Do you know why I help you? - No.

939
01:27:11,610 --> 01:27:13,305
不知道
Because he would want me to.

940
01:27:13,345 --> 01:27:15,745
因为这是他的意思

941
01:27:16,515 --> 01:27:18,813
我才不相信
Now, that I don't believe.

942
01:27:18,149 --> 01:27:21,110
Ahh.

943
01:27:21,453 --> 01:27:24,980
不然他要怎样才能再见到你？
How else is he ever going to see you again?

944
01:28:34,092 --> 01:28:35,525
妈咪，不许动
Freeze, Mommy.

945
01:28:35,560 --> 01:28:38,313
Bang, bang! Oh!

946
01:28:38,697 --> 01:28:41,962
我们中弹了，宝贝，妈咪打中我们了
Oh! She got us, B.B.

947
01:28:39,897 --> 01:28:42,859
Mommy got us. Oh, I'm dying!

948
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:43,194
我快死了
I'm dying.

949
01:28:43,235 --> 01:28:46,500
我快死了

950
01:28:47,873 --> 01:28:51,468
快倒下，妈咪打中我们了
Fall down, sweetheart. Mommy shot us.

951
01:28:53,212 --> 01:28:56,204
但神枪手小妞儿毫不知情
But little did Quickdraw Kiddo know that little B.B. was only playing possum,

952
01:28:56,248 --> 01:28:59,513
小宝贝只是在装死

953
01:28:59,551 --> 01:29:00,779
因为
due to the fact that she was impervious to bullets.

954
01:29:00,819 --> 01:29:04,516
子弹根本伤不了她

955
01:29:04,556 --> 01:29:06,683
妈咪，子弹伤不了我耶
I am pervious to bullets, Mommy.

956
01:29:06,725 --> 01:29:10,354
躺好啦，你在装死
Hey, get back down there. You're playing possum.

957
01:29:10,395 --> 01:29:16,163
所以冷笑的杀手还以为这是
So, as the smirking killer advanced on what she thought

958
01:29:16,201 --> 01:29:18,795
一具被子弹打死的尸体
was a bullet-ridden corpse, that's when little B.B. fired.

959
01:29:18,837 --> 01:29:21,829
此时小宝贝就开枪了

960
01:29:24,710 --> 01:29:27,008
砰砰
Bang, bang!

961
01:29:33,085 --> 01:29:34,746
妈咪，你死了
You're dead, Mommy. So die.

962
01:29:34,786 --> 01:29:37,050
快死啊

963
01:29:37,747 --> 01:29:39,040
Oh!

964
01:29:42,561 --> 01:29:43,994
宝贝
B.B.

965
01:29:47,173 --> 01:29:50,802
Oh! B.B...

966
01:29:49,668 --> 01:29:51,499
宝贝

967
01:29:54,339 --> 01:29:57,001
我早该知道的
I should've known.

968
01:29:57,042 --> 01:29:59,602
你最厉害
You are... the best.

969
01:30:07,319 --> 01:30:10,345
妈咪，不要死啦
Oh, Mommy. Don't die.

970
01:30:10,389 --> 01:30:12,857
我只是在闹着玩的
I was just playing.

971
01:30:18,030 --> 01:30:20,089
我知道
I know.

972
01:30:33,579 --> 01:30:36,514
我跟她说你睡着了
I told her you were asleep...

973
01:30:36,548 --> 01:30:39,176
但有一天你会醒过来
...but that one day you'd wake up and come back to her.

974
01:30:39,217 --> 01:30:41,549
回来找她

975
01:30:41,587 --> 01:30:43,111
她问我
And she asked me, "If Mommy's been asleep since I was born,

976
01:30:43,155 --> 01:30:45,680
我一出生妈咪就睡着了

977
01:30:45,724 --> 01:30:48,522
那她怎么知道我长什么模样？
then how will she know what I look like?"

978
01:30:48,560 --> 01:30:50,858
我回答她说
To which I replied, "Because Mommy's been dreaming of you. "

979
01:30:50,896 --> 01:30:54,992
因为妈咪会梦见你啊

980
01:30:56,435 --> 01:30:58,198
我是这么回答的
That's what I said.

981
01:30:59,237 --> 01:31:02,900
你有没有梦到我？我有梦到你耶
Did you dream of me? I dreamed of you.

982
01:31:03,609 --> 01:31:07,375
我每天晚上都梦到你，宝贝
Every single night, baby. Every single night.

983
01:31:07,412 --> 01:31:11,712
妈咪，我等了好久你才醒过来
I waited a long time for you to wake up, Mommy.

984
01:31:23,095 --> 01:31:24,995
让我好好看看你
Now, let me look at you.

985
01:31:26,022 --> 01:31:28,566
Oh.

986
01:31:31,970 --> 01:31:35,701
天哪，好漂亮的小女孩
My, my, my, what a pretty little girl you are.

987
01:31:35,741 --> 01:31:38,403
妈咪也很漂亮啊
You're pretty too, Mommy.

988
01:31:43,915 --> 01:31:47,681
跟妈咪说我拿她的照片给你看
Tell Mommy what you said when I showed you her picture.

989
01:31:47,719 --> 01:31:48,777
你怎么说的
Mnh-mnh.

990
01:31:48,820 --> 01:31:51,550
说嘛，别害羞了
- Come on, shy girl. - Mnh-mnh.

991
01:31:51,590 --> 01:31:54,286
快说啊，你怎么说的自己最清楚
Come on. You know what you said.

992
01:31:54,326 --> 01:31:55,258
说啊
Come on. Tell Mommy. It'll make her feel good. Come on.

993
01:31:55,293 --> 01:31:59,753
告诉妈咪，她一定会很开心

994
01:31:59,798 --> 01:32:01,095
快说啊
- Mnh-mnh. - Yeah. Come on.

995
01:32:01,133 --> 01:32:03,624
我说
I said... I said,

996
01:32:03,669 --> 01:32:11,337
你是全世界最漂亮的大美女
"You're the most beautifulest woman I ever saw in the whole wide world. "

997
01:32:11,376 --> 01:32:13,207
那是真的
That's the truth. That's what she said.

998
01:32:13,245 --> 01:32:15,338
她就是这么说的

999
01:32:15,914 --> 01:32:17,142
宝贝
B.B., don't you think Mommy has the prettiest hair in the whole wide world?

1000
01:32:17,182 --> 01:32:20,379
你不觉得妈咪的头发

1001
01:32:20,419 --> 01:32:22,319
是全世界最漂亮的吗？

1002
01:32:22,354 --> 01:32:23,787
对啊
- Yes, I do. - Matter of fact, it's better than pretty.

1003
01:32:23,822 --> 01:32:27,314
其实不只是漂亮而已

1004
01:32:27,359 --> 01:32:30,089
怎样形容才比漂亮更漂亮？
- What's better than pretty? - Mmm... Gorgeous.

1005
01:32:31,063 --> 01:32:32,325
美若天仙
Very good. Gorgeous. Mommy is gorgeous.

1006
01:32:32,364 --> 01:32:35,731
很好，美若天仙

1007
01:32:35,767 --> 01:32:37,826
妈咪美若天仙

1008
01:32:39,011 --> 01:32:44,767
Hmm. You know, sweetie, Mommy's kinda mad at Daddy.

1009
01:32:41,673 --> 01:32:45,165
甜心，妈咪在生爸爸的气

1010
01:32:45,210 --> 01:32:47,940
为什么？你是坏爸爸吗？
Why, Daddy? Were you being a bad daddy?

1011
01:32:47,979 --> 01:32:49,606
对啊
I'm afraid I was. I was a real bad daddy.

1012
01:32:49,648 --> 01:32:52,674
我是个很坏的爸爸

1013
01:32:53,885 --> 01:32:58,254
我们女儿前几天见识到了生与死
Our little girl learned about life and death the other day.

1014
01:32:58,290 --> 01:33:01,987
跟妈咪说埃米利奥怎么啦
Wanna tell Mommy about what happened to Emilio?

1015
01:33:04,529 --> 01:33:06,861
我杀死它
I killed him.

1016
01:33:07,566 --> 01:33:09,295
埃米利奥是她的金鱼
- Emilio was her goldfish. - Emilio was my goldfish.

1017
01:33:09,334 --> 01:33:11,996
埃米利奥是我的金鱼

1018
01:33:12,804 --> 01:33:15,102
她跑进我房间
She came running into my room, holding the fish in her hand and crying,

1019
01:33:15,140 --> 01:33:17,335
手里捧着鱼哭着说

1020
01:33:17,375 --> 01:33:20,970
爸爸，埃米利奥死掉了
"Daddy. Daddy. Emilio's dead. "

1021
01:33:22,114 --> 01:33:26,141
我说：“真的吗？好可怜啊”
And I said, "Really? That's so sad.

1022
01:33:26,184 --> 01:33:28,482
他是怎么死的？
How did he die?"

1023
01:33:28,520 --> 01:33:29,987
你怎么回答我？
- And what did you say? - I stepped on him.

1024
01:33:30,021 --> 01:33:31,545
我踩到它了

1025
01:33:31,590 --> 01:33:33,353
这位小姐
Actually, young lady, the words you so strategically used were,

1026
01:33:33,391 --> 01:33:36,986
其实你技巧性的回答是：

1027
01:33:37,028 --> 01:33:39,997
我不小心踩到它了
"I accidentally stepped on him. "

1028
01:33:41,466 --> 01:33:42,956
于是我就质疑
To which I queried,

1029
01:33:43,001 --> 01:33:45,663
你的脚怎么会不小心
"And just how did your foot accidentally find its way into Emilio's fishbowl?"

1030
01:33:45,704 --> 01:33:48,502
踩进埃米利奥的鱼缸里？

1031
01:33:48,540 --> 01:33:49,768
她说：“不是啦”
And she said, "No, no, no. Emilio was on the carpet when I stepped on him. "

1032
01:33:49,808 --> 01:33:53,209
踩到时埃米利奥是在地毯上

1033
01:33:54,146 --> 01:33:56,842
剧情愈来愈紧张了
Mmm. The plot thickens.

1034
01:33:56,882 --> 01:34:01,876
埃米利奥怎么会在地毯上呢？
"And just how did Emilio get on the carpet?"

1035
01:34:01,920 --> 01:34:07,552
妈咪，你一定会以她为傲
And, Mommy, you would've been so proud of her.

1036
01:34:07,592 --> 01:34:09,787
她没撒谎
She didn't lie.

1037
01:34:09,828 --> 01:34:14,094
她说她把埃米利奥从鱼缸抓出来
She said she took Emilio out of his bowl...

1038
01:34:14,132 --> 01:34:17,295
把它放在地毯上
...and put him on the carpet.

1039
01:34:19,237 --> 01:34:22,400
埃米利奥在地毯上做什么？
And whatwas Emilio doing on the carpet?

1040
01:34:23,575 --> 01:34:26,135
一直跳
Flapping.

1041
01:34:26,178 --> 01:34:28,305
然后你就用力踩它
- And then you stomped on him. - Uh-huh.

1042
01:34:30,315 --> 01:34:33,842
等你把脚抬起来以后
And when you lifted up your foot...

1043
01:34:33,885 --> 01:34:36,285
埃米利奥在做什么？
- ... what was Emilio doing then? - Nothing.

1044
01:34:36,321 --> 01:34:38,118
没做什么
He stopped flapping, didn't he?

1045
01:34:38,156 --> 01:34:40,818
它没再跳了，对不对？

1046
01:34:43,295 --> 01:34:45,820
她后来告诉我
She told me later...

1047
01:34:45,864 --> 01:34:50,392
她抬起脚时看到埃米利奥没在跳
...that the second she lifted up her foot

1048
01:34:48,140 --> 01:34:52,353
and saw Emilio not flapping, she knew what she had done.

1049
01:34:50,435 --> 01:34:53,029
她就知道自己做了什么事

1050
01:34:53,071 --> 01:34:57,770
这不正是生与死的完美实例吗？
Is that not the perfect visual image of life and death?

1051
01:34:57,809 --> 01:35:00,039
金鱼在地毯上一直跳
A fish flapping on the carpet, and a fish not flapping on the carpet.

1052
01:35:00,078 --> 01:35:03,241
金鱼在地毯上没在跳

1053
01:35:05,083 --> 01:35:06,778
如此强烈的意象
So powerful, even a four-year-old with no concept of life or death...

1054
01:35:06,818 --> 01:35:11,152
就连不懂何谓生死的四岁小孩

1055
01:35:11,189 --> 01:35:13,089
都知道这代表了什么
...knew what it meant.

1056
01:35:14,492 --> 01:35:16,517
你很爱埃米利奥吧？
- You loved Emilio, didn't you? - Uh-huh.

1057
01:35:17,629 --> 01:35:22,032
我也爱妈咪
Well... I love Mommy too.

1058
01:35:22,067 --> 01:35:24,535
但我对妈咪和你对埃米利奥一样
But I did to Mommy what you did to Emilio.

1059
01:35:24,569 --> 01:35:26,469
你用力踩妈咪？
- You stomped on Mommy? - Worse.

1060
01:35:26,504 --> 01:35:28,369
更糟糕

1061
01:35:28,406 --> 01:35:30,431
我枪杀了妈咪
I shot Mommy.

1062
01:35:30,475 --> 01:35:33,706
不是像我们刚才那样假装开枪
Not pretend shooting like we were just doing.

1063
01:35:33,745 --> 01:35:35,679
我是真的开枪射她
I shot her for real.

1064
01:35:35,714 --> 01:35:38,239
为什么？你想知道会怎样吗？
Why? Did you want to see what would happen?

1065
01:35:38,283 --> 01:35:42,777
不是，我知道开了枪妈咪会怎样
No, I knew what would happen to Mommy if I shot her.

1066
01:35:42,821 --> 01:35:44,789
我不知道的是
What I didn't know was, when I shot Mommy, what would happen to me.

1067
01:35:44,823 --> 01:35:47,758
我枪杀了妈咪之后我会怎样

1068
01:35:47,792 --> 01:35:49,282
结果是怎样？
- What happened? - I was very sad.

1069
01:35:49,327 --> 01:35:53,388
我很伤心

1070
01:35:53,431 --> 01:35:55,661
这是我学到的教训
And that's when I learned...

1071
01:35:55,700 --> 01:35:58,669
有些事一旦做了
...some things, once you do, they can never be undone.

1072
01:35:58,703 --> 01:36:00,864
就再也无法挽回了

1073
01:36:04,075 --> 01:36:06,339
妈咪怎么了？
- What happened to Mommy? - Why don't you ask Mommy?

1074
01:36:07,712 --> 01:36:09,202
你自己问妈咪啊
You OK, Mommy? Does it hurt?

1075
01:36:09,247 --> 01:36:12,478
妈咪，你还好吧？会不会痛？

1076
01:36:12,517 --> 01:36:14,417
不会
No, sweetie.

1077
01:36:16,221 --> 01:36:18,621
已经不痛了
Doesn't hurt anymore.

1078
01:36:24,362 --> 01:36:27,263
你有没有生病？
Did it make you sick?

1079
01:36:27,299 --> 01:36:29,859
没有
No. It made me sleep.

1080
01:36:29,901 --> 01:36:31,994
我只是睡着了

1081
01:36:32,037 --> 01:36:34,938
所以才不能陪你，因为我睡着了
That's why I haven't been with you. B.B. I've been asleep.

1082
01:36:34,973 --> 01:36:38,568
可是你现在醒了啊，对不对？
But you're awake now, Mommy. Right?

1083
01:36:38,610 --> 01:36:41,943
我非常清醒，漂亮宝贝
I'm wide awake, pretty girl.

1084
01:36:41,980 --> 01:36:44,141
宝贝，你要不要妈咪
B.B., would you like Mommy to watch a video with you before sleepy time?

1085
01:36:44,182 --> 01:36:48,551
陪你在睡觉前看录影带？

1086
01:36:48,586 --> 01:36:50,884
妈咪，你要不要陪我
Uh-huh.

1087
01:36:48,552 --> 01:36:52,056
Mommy, do you want to watch a video with me before sleepy time?

1088
01:36:50,922 --> 01:36:52,822
在睡觉前看录影带？
Oh, yeah! I would love to.

1089
01:36:52,857 --> 01:36:55,826
好啊，乐意之至

1090
01:36:55,860 --> 01:36:57,054
你想看哪一部？
- Which one do you wanna watch? - Shogun Assassin.

1091
01:36:57,095 --> 01:36:58,153
《刺杀大将军》
No, B.B. Shogun Assassin is too long.

1092
01:36:58,196 --> 01:37:01,063
不行，《刺杀大将军》太长了

1093
01:37:00,523 --> 01:37:04,610
- Mnh-mnh. - No, it's not.

1094
01:37:03,201 --> 01:37:05,135
不会啦
Well, then, I'll leave you ladies to it.

1095
01:37:05,170 --> 01:37:07,195
好吧

1096
01:37:07,238 --> 01:37:09,365
你们母女慢慢欣赏

1097
01:37:16,047 --> 01:37:18,481
在我小的时候
When I was little, my father was famous.

1098
01:37:18,516 --> 01:37:21,417
我爸很有名

1099
01:37:21,452 --> 01:37:25,786
他是全日本最伟大的武士
He was the greatest samurai in the empire.

1100
01:37:25,823 --> 01:37:29,122
他专门砍幕府将军的头
And he was the shogun's decapitator.

1101
01:37:29,160 --> 01:37:34,462
他砍了131个诸侯的头
He cut off the heads of 131 lords.

1102
01:37:34,498 --> 01:37:37,058
我爸事后会回家找我妈
My father would come home to Mother and when he would see her,

1103
01:37:37,101 --> 01:37:39,035
当他看到妈咪时

1104
01:37:39,070 --> 01:37:41,868
就会忘记杀人的事
he would forget about the killings.

1105
01:37:41,906 --> 01:37:44,238
他不怕幕府将军
He wasn't scared of the shogun, but the shogun was scared of him.

1106
01:37:44,275 --> 01:37:46,869
但幕府将军很怕他

1107
01:37:46,911 --> 01:37:49,880
或许这正是问题所在吧
Maybe that was the problem.

1108
01:37:49,914 --> 01:37:51,506
有一天晚上
One night, the shogun sent...

1109
01:37:51,549 --> 01:37:54,177
幕府将军派了忍者间谍

1110
01:40:15,126 --> 01:40:18,789
我正在欣赏你的武士刀
I was just admiring your sword.

1111
01:40:18,829 --> 01:40:20,956
好一把上等名刀
Quite a piece of work.

1112
01:40:21,732 --> 01:40:25,759
对了，服部半藏还好吧？
Speaking of which, how is Hanzo-san?

1113
01:40:25,803 --> 01:40:27,771
他很好
He's good.

1114
01:40:29,273 --> 01:40:32,800
他做的寿司有没有比较好吃？
Has his sushi gotten any better?

1115
01:40:35,446 --> 01:40:37,277
我真不敢相信
You know, I couldn't believe it. You got him to make you a sword.

1116
01:40:37,314 --> 01:40:40,283
你居然说服他替你铸刀

1117
01:40:40,317 --> 01:40:42,376
很简单
It was easy. I just dropped your name, Bill.

1118
01:40:42,420 --> 01:40:45,116
我只是提了你的名字

1119
01:40:45,723 --> 01:40:47,247
这就够了啊
That'd do it.

1120
01:41:17,988 --> 01:41:20,218
你是打算用服部半藏的刀
I suppose the idea is we cross Hanzo swords. Am I right?

1121
01:41:20,257 --> 01:41:21,918
和我决一死战

1122
01:41:21,959 --> 01:41:23,950
对不对？

1123
01:41:25,262 --> 01:41:28,629
说来也巧
Well,

1124
01:41:26,830 --> 01:41:31,919
it just so happens this hacienda has its own private beach.

1125
01:41:28,666 --> 01:41:32,158
这栋别墅碰巧有私人海滩

1126
01:41:32,203 --> 01:41:33,404
而且皎洁的月光洒在私人海滩上
And that private beach just so happens to look particularly beautiful

1127
01:41:33,404 --> 01:41:39,505
美得令人眩目

1128
01:41:36,423 --> 01:41:38,092
bathed in moonlight.

1129
01:41:39,543 --> 01:41:42,444
今晚正好是满月之夜
And there just so happens to be a full moon out tonight.

1130
01:41:42,480 --> 01:41:45,347
持刀的武士
So, swordfighter, if you want a swordfight, that's where I suggest.

1131
01:41:45,382 --> 01:41:47,509
若你想用刀和我决斗

1132
01:41:47,551 --> 01:41:49,815
建议你选在这片海滩上

1133
01:41:49,854 --> 01:41:53,449
但你若想保守一点
But if you wanna be old school about it...

1134
01:41:53,491 --> 01:41:56,722
你也知道我这个人很保守
...and you know I'm all about old school...

1135
01:41:57,294 --> 01:41:58,989
那我们可以等到天亮
...then we could wait until dawn and slice each other up at sunrise

1136
01:41:59,029 --> 01:42:01,862
在旭日初升时拿刀互砍

1137
01:42:01,899 --> 01:42:03,298
像名副其实的两个…
like a couple of real-life honest...

1138
01:42:05,636 --> 01:42:07,103
现在
Now, if you don't settle down, I'm gonna have to put one in your kneecap.

1139
01:42:07,138 --> 01:42:08,196
你再不安分一点

1140
01:42:08,239 --> 01:42:10,673
我就在你膝盖骨上再补一枪

1141
01:42:10,708 --> 01:42:14,371
听说射在膝盖骨上超痛的
And I hear tell that's a very painful place to get shot in.

1142
01:42:15,921 --> 01:42:20,384
I'm just fuckin' with you.

1143
01:42:18,482 --> 01:42:20,507
跟你开个玩笑啦

1144
01:42:21,652 --> 01:42:23,779
现在
Now...

1145
01:42:23,821 --> 01:42:26,289
提到你的事
...when it comes to you...

1146
01:42:26,323 --> 01:42:29,884
还有我们的关系
...and us...

1147
01:42:29,927 --> 01:42:33,294
我有几个疑问想理清一下
...I have a few unanswered questions.

1148
01:42:33,330 --> 01:42:37,096
在这个血腥复仇故事
So, before this tale of bloody revenge reaches its climax,

1149
01:42:37,134 --> 01:42:39,830
演变到最高潮之前

1150
01:42:39,870 --> 01:42:42,338
我要问你几件事
I'm gonna ask you some questions, and I want you to tell me the truth.

1151
01:42:42,373 --> 01:42:45,069
希望你能实话实说

1152
01:42:45,109 --> 01:42:49,375
不过说到这里就很两难了
However, there in lies a dilemma.

1153
01:42:49,413 --> 01:42:52,382
因为只要提到我的事
Because when it comes to the subject of me,

1154
01:42:52,416 --> 01:42:55,749
我可以确定你百分之百
I believe you are truly and utterly incapable of telling the truth.

1155
01:42:55,786 --> 01:42:57,651
不可能实话实说
Especially to me. And least of all, to yourself.

1156
01:42:57,688 --> 01:42:58,655
尤其是在面对我时

1157
01:42:58,689 --> 01:43:02,216
反正你也会自欺欺人

1158
01:43:02,259 --> 01:43:05,490
只要提到我的事
And when it comes to the subject of me,

1159
01:43:05,529 --> 01:43:10,057
我可以确定你说的话
I am truly and utterly incapable of believing anything you say.

1160
01:43:10,100 --> 01:43:12,398
我连一个字都不会相信

1161
01:43:12,436 --> 01:43:14,495
这个难题怎么解决？
How do you suppose we solve this dilemma?

1162
01:43:14,538 --> 01:43:16,267
这个嘛
Well,

1163
01:43:16,307 --> 01:43:18,673
说来也巧
it just so happens,

1164
01:43:18,709 --> 01:43:20,734
我正好有办法解决
I have a solution.

1165
01:43:21,478 --> 01:43:23,309
一枪命中
- Aah! - Gotcha!

1166
01:43:23,347 --> 01:43:25,781
妈的！
Goddamn!

1167
01:43:27,885 --> 01:43:31,446
你是拿什么东西射我？
What the fuck did you just shoot me with?

1168
01:43:31,488 --> 01:43:33,353
我最伟大的发明
My greatest invention. Or at least my favorite.

1169
01:43:33,390 --> 01:43:35,654
至少是我最喜欢的

1170
01:43:35,693 --> 01:43:36,785
不准碰
Don't touch it, or I'll stick another one right in your cheek.

1171
01:43:36,827 --> 01:43:40,092
否则我在你脸颊上再补一箭

1172
01:43:43,334 --> 01:43:45,825
那根箭里面的药剂
What lies within that dart, just begging to course its way through your veins...

1173
01:43:45,869 --> 01:43:49,635
正在你的血液里流动

1174
01:43:49,673 --> 01:43:51,504
药效很强
...is an incredibly potent and quite infallible truth serum.

1175
01:43:51,542 --> 01:43:54,272
保证你会什么事都全盘托出

1176
01:43:54,311 --> 01:43:55,403
我称之为
I call it "The Undisputed Truth. "

1177
01:43:55,446 --> 01:43:57,414
“不争的事实”

1178
01:43:57,448 --> 01:43:59,814
药效是巴比妥盐麻醉剂的两倍
Twice as strong as sodium pentothal, with no druggie aftereffects.

1179
01:43:59,850 --> 01:44:02,944
又不会用药成瘾

1180
01:44:02,987 --> 01:44:04,579
只不过
Exceptfor a slight wave of euphoria. You feel it?

1181
01:44:04,622 --> 01:44:07,853
会出现幸福愉悦的幻觉

1182
01:44:07,891 --> 01:44:09,415
感觉到了吗？
- Euphoria? - Yeah.

1183
01:44:09,460 --> 01:44:10,791
幻觉？

1184
01:44:10,828 --> 01:44:11,852
对
- No. - Too bad.

1185
01:44:11,895 --> 01:44:13,328
没有

1186
01:44:13,364 --> 01:44:15,924
真可惜

1187
01:44:15,966 --> 01:44:18,332
你最了解我了
As you know...

1188
01:44:18,369 --> 01:44:21,896
我很喜欢看漫画书
...I'm quite keen on comic books.

1189
01:44:22,706 --> 01:44:25,539
尤其是有超级英雄的漫画书
Especially the ones about superheroes.

1190
01:44:25,576 --> 01:44:27,737
我对关于超级英雄的
I find the whole mythology surrounding superheroes fascinating.

1191
01:44:27,778 --> 01:44:31,236
所有故事都很感兴趣

1192
01:44:31,282 --> 01:44:33,614
以我最喜欢的超级英雄为例
Take my favorite superhero, Superman.

1193
01:44:33,651 --> 01:44:35,915
超人

1194
01:44:35,953 --> 01:44:39,684
不是什么好漫画书啦，画得不好
Not a great comic book. Not particularlywell drawn.

1195
01:44:40,524 --> 01:44:41,525
Mmm.

1196
01:44:42,593 --> 01:44:44,788
但整个故事
But the mythology...

1197
01:44:44,828 --> 01:44:48,958
整个故事不只是精彩还很特别
The mythology is not only great, it's unique.

1198
01:44:48,999 --> 01:44:52,696
这玩意儿要多久才会发挥药效？
How long does this shit take to go into effect?

1199
01:44:52,736 --> 01:44:53,862
差不多两分钟
About two minutes. Just long enough for me to finish my point.

1200
01:44:53,904 --> 01:44:56,600
正好足够让我说完重点

1201
01:44:56,640 --> 01:44:58,267
现在
Now, a staple of the superhero mythology is,

1202
01:44:58,309 --> 01:45:02,245
超级英雄神话里的基本要素是

1203
01:45:02,279 --> 01:45:04,941
要有超级英雄和他的另一面
there's the superhero and there's the alter ego.

1204
01:45:04,982 --> 01:45:07,212
蝙蝠侠的真实身份是布鲁斯・韦恩
Batman is actually Bruce Wayne, Spider-Man is actually Peter Parker.

1205
01:45:07,251 --> 01:45:10,345
蜘蛛侠是彼得・帕克

1206
01:45:10,387 --> 01:45:12,378
他早上一起床
When that characterwakes up in the morning, he's Peter Parker.

1207
01:45:12,423 --> 01:45:14,789
就是彼得・帕克了

1208
01:45:14,825 --> 01:45:16,554
他要换了衣服
He has to put on a costume to become Spider-Man.

1209
01:45:16,593 --> 01:45:19,494
才会变成蜘蛛侠

1210
01:45:19,530 --> 01:45:21,998
根据这一点
And it is in that characteristic Superman stands alone.

1211
01:45:22,032 --> 01:45:25,468
超人就是独一无二的了

1212
01:45:25,502 --> 01:45:28,335
超人不会变成超人
Superman didn't become Superman.

1213
01:45:28,372 --> 01:45:31,205
超人一生下来就是超人
Superman was born Superman.

1214
01:45:31,241 --> 01:45:33,038
超人早上一起床
When Superman wakes up in the morning, he's Superman.

1215
01:45:33,077 --> 01:45:35,477
他就是超人了

1216
01:45:35,512 --> 01:45:38,970
他的另一面是克拉克・肯特
His alter ego is Clark Kent.

1217
01:45:39,016 --> 01:45:42,315
他那件上面印着红色S的衣服
His outfitwith the big red "S" -

1218
01:45:42,353 --> 01:45:45,982
是肯特夫妇捡到弃婴身上的包巾
that's the blanket he was wrapped in as a baby when the Kents found him.

1219
01:45:46,023 --> 01:45:48,992
那是他的衣服
Those are his clothes.

1220
01:45:49,026 --> 01:45:52,393
肯特的打扮：戴眼镜、穿西装
What Kent wears - the glasses, the business suit - that's the costume.

1221
01:45:52,429 --> 01:45:54,260
那只是他的扮相

1222
01:45:54,298 --> 01:45:56,391
超人要打扮成这样
That's the costume Superman wears to blend in with us.

1223
01:45:56,433 --> 01:46:00,426
才能混进人群里

1224
01:46:00,471 --> 01:46:04,032
克拉克・肯特是超人眼里的我们
Clark Kent is how Superman views us.

1225
01:46:04,074 --> 01:46:07,407
克拉克・肯特有什么特征？
And what are the characteristics of Clark Kent?

1226
01:46:07,444 --> 01:46:09,844
他很孬种
He's weak...

1227
01:46:09,880 --> 01:46:12,678
没自信
...he's unsure of himself...

1228
01:46:12,716 --> 01:46:14,843
他是个胆小鬼
...he's a coward.

1229
01:46:15,552 --> 01:46:17,452
克拉克・肯特是超人
Clark Kent is Superman's critique on the whole human race.

1230
01:46:17,488 --> 01:46:22,289
对全体人类的观点

1231
01:46:22,326 --> 01:46:24,851
就好比比阿特丽克斯小妞儿
Sort of like Beatrix Kiddo and Mrs. Tommy Plimpton.

1232
01:46:24,895 --> 01:46:27,625
和汤米・普林顿太太

1233
01:46:28,399 --> 01:46:30,458
原来如此
Aso.

1234
01:46:30,501 --> 01:46:33,129
你说到重点了
The point emerges.

1235
01:46:34,371 --> 01:46:37,898
你可以打扮成艾琳・普林顿
You would've worn the costume of Arlene Plimpton.

1236
01:46:37,941 --> 01:46:41,741
但你一生下来就是比阿特丽克斯小妞儿
But you were born Beatrix Kiddo.

1237
01:46:41,779 --> 01:46:44,373
你每天早上起床时
And every morning when you woke up, you'd still be Beatrix Kiddo.

1238
01:46:44,415 --> 01:46:46,906
还是比阿特丽克斯小妞儿

1239
01:46:46,950 --> 01:46:50,147
箭可以拔掉了
Oh, you can... take the needle out.

1240
01:46:56,326 --> 01:46:58,487
你认为我是超级英雄吗？
Are you calling me a superhero?

1241
01:46:58,529 --> 01:47:01,020
我认为你是个杀手
I'm calling you a killer.

1242
01:47:01,064 --> 01:47:04,033
天生的闪灵杀手
A natural born killer.

1243
01:47:04,067 --> 01:47:05,398
你一直都是
You always have been, and you always will be.

1244
01:47:05,436 --> 01:47:07,734
将来也不会改变

1245
01:47:07,771 --> 01:47:09,830
就算搬去埃尔帕索
Moving to El Paso...

1246
01:47:09,873 --> 01:47:13,400
在二手唱片行上班
...working in a used record store...

1247
01:47:13,444 --> 01:47:16,038
和汤米一起去看电影
...goin' to the movies with Tommy...

1248
01:47:16,079 --> 01:47:17,671
从报纸上剪印花
...clipping coupons.

1249
01:47:17,714 --> 01:47:19,443
都只是你
That's you...

1250
01:47:19,483 --> 01:47:22,975
想把自己伪装成一只工蜂
...trying to disguise yourself as a worker bee.

1251
01:47:23,020 --> 01:47:26,183
你想混进蜂群里
That's you tryin' to blend in with the hive.

1252
01:47:26,223 --> 01:47:29,522
但你不是工蜂
But you're not a worker bee.

1253
01:47:29,560 --> 01:47:32,461
你是叛变的杀人蜂
You're a renegade killer bee.

1254
01:47:32,496 --> 01:47:34,259
不管你喝了多少啤酒
And no matter how much beer you drank or barbecue you ate

1255
01:47:34,298 --> 01:47:37,165
吃了多少烤肉
or how fat your ass got,

1256
01:47:37,201 --> 01:47:38,725
或是屁股变得多大
nothing in the world would ever change that.

1257
01:47:38,769 --> 01:47:44,969
再怎么样也改变不了事实

1258
01:47:45,008 --> 01:47:49,138
第一个问题
First question:

1259
01:47:49,179 --> 01:47:52,512
你觉得洗心革面去了埃尔帕索
Did you really think your life in El Paso was gonna work?

1260
01:47:52,549 --> 01:47:54,813
就能重新开始吗？

1261
01:48:00,324 --> 01:48:02,189
不行
No!

1262
01:48:05,496 --> 01:48:08,590
但我可以陪着宝贝长大
But I would've had B.B.!

1263
01:48:09,132 --> 01:48:11,259
别误解我的意思
Don't get me wrong.

1264
01:48:11,301 --> 01:48:15,260
我相信你会是个好妈咪
I think you would have been a wonderful mother.

1265
01:48:15,305 --> 01:48:17,705
但你是个杀手
But you are a killer.

1266
01:48:21,945 --> 01:48:24,812
你杀了这么多人才找到我
All those people you killed to get to me...

1267
01:48:24,848 --> 01:48:27,214
感觉很爽吧？
...felt damn good, didn't they?

1268
01:48:29,520 --> 01:48:31,147
对
Yes.

1269
01:48:32,022 --> 01:48:35,355
杀死每一个人都很爽？
Every single one of them?

1270
01:48:44,668 --> 01:48:46,568
对
Yes.

1271
01:48:49,640 --> 01:48:52,336
这个问题只是让你暖暖身
That was the warmup round.

1272
01:48:52,376 --> 01:48:53,536
现在要问的是
Now comes the $64,000 question.

1273
01:48:53,577 --> 01:48:57,513
价值百万奖金的大问题

1274
01:49:04,321 --> 01:49:08,121
为何怀了我的孩子又弃我而去？
Why did you run away from me with my baby?

1275
01:49:11,895 --> 01:49:15,695
还记得你派给我的最后任务吗？
Do you rememberthe last assignment you sent me on?

1276
01:49:15,732 --> 01:49:17,757
当然记得
Of course.

1277
01:49:17,801 --> 01:49:20,099
王丽莎
Lisa Wong.

1278
01:49:21,204 --> 01:49:25,436
我启程的那天早上觉得不太舒服
The morning I left, I was sick.

1279
01:49:25,475 --> 01:49:28,467
我在飞机上呕吐了
On the plane, I threw up.

1280
01:49:29,913 --> 01:49:33,872
于是我开始怀疑
So I started thinking:

1281
01:49:33,917 --> 01:49:36,351
我可能怀孕了
Maybe I was pregnant.

1282
01:49:36,386 --> 01:49:37,751
用法简单
"Easy to use. Remove cap and urinate on the absorbent end for five seconds.

1283
01:49:37,788 --> 01:49:41,315
取下盖子用尿液浸湿棉棒五秒钟

1284
01:49:43,226 --> 01:49:45,854
等九十秒就能准确地验孕
"Accurate results in only 90 seconds.

1285
01:49:45,896 --> 01:49:49,229
对照窗出现一条线即可判读结果
You can read the results as soon as the line appears in the window. "

1286
01:50:25,402 --> 01:50:26,266
真该死
Fuck.

1287
01:50:26,303 --> 01:50:28,396
我当时并不知道
What I didn't know...

1288
01:50:28,438 --> 01:50:32,670
我在途中已经被人发现了
...was that somewhere on my journey I had been spotted.

1289
01:50:32,709 --> 01:50:36,201
我才到洛杉矶，王丽莎随即…
With me in L.A., it didn't take Lisa Wong long to send an assassin of her own.

1290
01:50:36,246 --> 01:50:38,680
派了人来暗杀我

1291
01:50:39,983 --> 01:50:41,450
请问有什么事？
Hello, can I help you?

1292
01:50:41,485 --> 01:50:44,784
我是饭店的公关经理金凯伦
Hello, I'm Karen Kim. I'm the hospitality manager ofthe hotel.

1293
01:50:44,821 --> 01:50:46,846
我送迎宾礼来给你
I have a welcome gift from the management.

1294
01:50:46,890 --> 01:50:50,121
谢谢
Oh, that's nice. Um...

1295
01:50:50,160 --> 01:50:52,321
放在门口就好了
Can you just leave it by the door?

1296
01:51:04,541 --> 01:51:05,974
你是霰弹枪神射手吗？
- You pretty good with that shotgun? - Not that I have to be at this range,

1297
01:51:06,009 --> 01:51:07,977
这么近随便射都中

1298
01:51:08,011 --> 01:51:09,911
但我是霰弹枪神射手
but I'm a fuckin' surgeon with this shotgun.

1299
01:51:09,946 --> 01:51:11,538
贱人，你猜怎么着
Well, guess what, bitch? I'm better than Annie Oakley.

1300
01:51:11,581 --> 01:51:14,744
我的枪法神准，已经瞄准你了
- And I got you right in my sight. - I could blow your fuckin' head off.

1301
01:51:14,785 --> 01:51:16,650
我可以一枪打烂你的脑袋

1302
01:51:16,687 --> 01:51:19,019
我会抢先命中你的眉心
Not before I put one right between your eyes, so let's talk.

1303
01:51:19,056 --> 01:51:21,889
所以还是谈谈吧

1304
01:51:22,659 --> 01:51:26,254
凯伦
Karen...

1305
01:51:26,296 --> 01:51:28,856
我刚才发现
...I justfound out...

1306
01:51:28,899 --> 01:51:30,833
就在刚才
...right now...

1307
01:51:30,867 --> 01:51:36,806
在你一枪把门打穿之前没多久
...not a moment before you blew a hole through the door...

1308
01:51:36,840 --> 01:51:38,637
我发现自己怀孕了
- ... that I'm pregnant. - What is this?

1309
01:51:38,675 --> 01:51:41,166
你在耍什么花招？

1310
01:51:41,211 --> 01:51:44,078
在门边的地上
On the floor by the door...

1311
01:51:44,114 --> 01:51:47,311
有验孕棒可以证明我怀孕了
...is a strip that says I'm pregnant.

1312
01:51:47,350 --> 01:51:49,682
胡扯
Bullshit.

1313
01:51:49,720 --> 01:51:53,622
以前你这么说是对极了
Any other time you'd be 100 percent right.

1314
01:51:53,657 --> 01:51:56,717
但这次
This time...

1315
01:51:56,760 --> 01:52:00,628
你是大错特错了
...you're 100 percent wrong.

1316
01:52:00,664 --> 01:52:04,725
我是全世界最可怕的女杀手
I'm the deadliest woman in the world.

1317
01:52:04,768 --> 01:52:06,861
但现在
But right now...

1318
01:52:06,903 --> 01:52:10,202
我为了肚子里的宝宝心惊胆颤
...I'm just scared shitless for my baby.

1319
01:52:10,240 --> 01:52:13,141
求求你
Please.

1320
01:52:13,176 --> 01:52:15,872
看看验孕棒吧
Just look at the strip.

1321
01:52:17,748 --> 01:52:19,716
求求你
Please.

1322
01:52:20,884 --> 01:52:25,719
待在原地，不准轻举妄动
Stay where you are and don't move.

1323
01:52:42,839 --> 01:52:44,807
这玩意儿我看不懂啦
I don't know what this fuckin' shit means.

1324
01:52:44,841 --> 01:52:47,332
旁边的包装盒上有说明
The box with the directions - it's right there.

1325
01:52:59,489 --> 01:53:01,081
用法简单
"Easy to use.

1326
01:53:01,124 --> 01:53:06,061
取下盖子用尿液浸湿棉棒五秒钟
Remove the cap and urinate on the absorbent end. "

1327
01:53:06,096 --> 01:53:08,087
蓝色就表示怀孕了
Blue means pregnant.

1328
01:53:08,131 --> 01:53:10,725
我自己会看，不用你多事
I'll read it myself, thank you.

1329
01:53:18,008 --> 01:53:20,033
好吧
Oh, OK.

1330
01:53:20,076 --> 01:53:22,340
就算我相信你，那又怎样？
Say I were to believe you. What then?

1331
01:53:22,379 --> 01:53:26,179
你回家吧
Just go home.

1332
01:53:26,216 --> 01:53:28,343
我也回家
I'll do the same.

1333
01:53:47,871 --> 01:53:49,600
恭喜你
Congratulations.

1334
01:53:53,310 --> 01:53:55,904
在验孕棒呈现蓝色之前
Before that strip turned blue...

1335
01:53:55,946 --> 01:53:59,438
我是个女人，而且是你的女人
...I was a woman, I was your woman.

1336
01:53:59,482 --> 01:54:03,179
我是杀手，奉你之命去杀人
I was a killer who killed for you.

1337
01:54:03,220 --> 01:54:04,585
在验孕棒呈现蓝色之前
Before that strip turned blue, I would've jumped a motorcycle

1338
01:54:04,621 --> 01:54:09,354
我会骑摩托车跳上高速列车

1339
01:54:06,172 --> 01:54:08,216
onto a speeding train.

1340
01:54:09,392 --> 01:54:11,383
只为了你
For you.

1341
01:54:12,662 --> 01:54:16,098
但在验孕棒呈现蓝色之后
But once that strip turned blue...

1342
01:54:16,132 --> 01:54:19,568
我就再也做不到了
...I could no longer do any ofthose things.

1343
01:54:19,603 --> 01:54:22,163
再也做不到
Not anymore.

1344
01:54:22,205 --> 01:54:25,265
因为我要当母亲了
Because I was gonna be a mother.

1345
01:54:27,811 --> 01:54:32,771
你懂吗？
Can you understand that?

1346
01:54:32,816 --> 01:54:34,408
我懂
Yes.

1347
01:54:35,518 --> 01:54:38,578
但你当时为什么不说
But why didn't you...

1348
01:54:38,622 --> 01:54:40,817
到现在才告诉我？
...tell me then, instead of now?

1349
01:54:40,857 --> 01:54:43,451
你知道了一定会带走她
Once you knew, you'd claim her.

1350
01:54:43,493 --> 01:54:46,087
我不想那样
And I didn'twant that.

1351
01:54:46,129 --> 01:54:48,597
这不是你能决定的
Not your decision to make.

1352
01:54:48,632 --> 01:54:50,497
对
Yes.

1353
01:54:50,533 --> 01:54:52,467
但这是明智的决定
But it's the right decision, and I made it for my daughter.

1354
01:54:52,502 --> 01:54:54,902
我为我女儿作了决定

1355
01:54:54,938 --> 01:54:59,671
她理应生长在平凡清白的家庭里
She deserved to be born with a clean slate.

1356
01:54:59,709 --> 01:55:01,643
但和你在一起
But with you...

1357
01:55:01,678 --> 01:55:07,207
她要生在不适合她成长的环境里
...she would've been born into a world she shouldn't have.

1358
01:55:07,250 --> 01:55:10,651
我必须抉择
I had to choose.

1359
01:55:10,687 --> 01:55:13,178
我选了她
I chose her.

1360
01:55:15,258 --> 01:55:17,988
五年前
You know, five years ago,

1361
01:55:18,028 --> 01:55:19,655
若要我列出一份名单
if I had to make a list of impossible things that could never happen,

1362
01:55:19,696 --> 01:55:22,961
列举永远不可能发生的事

1363
01:55:22,999 --> 01:55:25,126
你拿枪指着我的脑袋
you performing a coup de grace on me by bustin' a cap in my crown...

1364
01:55:25,168 --> 01:55:31,004
补上一枪结束我的苦难

1365
01:55:31,041 --> 01:55:33,669
这绝对是名单上的第一名
...would've been right at the top of the list.

1366
01:55:35,378 --> 01:55:37,972
我错了，对吧？
I'd have been wrong, wouldn't I?

1367
01:55:38,748 --> 01:55:40,579
抱歉
I- I'm sorry.

1368
01:55:40,617 --> 01:55:42,517
你是在问我吗？
Was that a question?

1369
01:55:44,020 --> 01:55:46,784
在永远不可能发生的事当中
Of impossible things that could never happen -

1370
01:55:46,823 --> 01:55:50,725
对，在此例中你是错了
yes, in this instance you would've been wrong.

1371
01:55:50,760 --> 01:55:52,853
为什么？
Well?

1372
01:55:52,896 --> 01:55:55,729
你一直没有回来找我
When you never came back,

1373
01:55:55,765 --> 01:55:57,892
我的直觉反应就是
I naturally assumed Lisa Wong, or somebody else, had killed you.

1374
01:55:57,934 --> 01:56:01,961
王丽莎，或者其他什么人杀了你

1375
01:56:02,005 --> 01:56:05,173
对了，你没死
Oh! And for the record...

1376
01:56:05,208 --> 01:56:09,611
却让我以为自己心爱的人死了
...letting somebody think somebody they love is dead when they're not

1377
01:56:09,646 --> 01:56:12,046
是一件很残忍的事
is quite cruel.

1378
01:56:14,918 --> 01:56:19,719
我替你哀悼了三个月
I mourned you forthree months.

1379
01:56:19,756 --> 01:56:24,056
在哀悼你的第三个月
And in the third month of mourning you...

1380
01:56:24,094 --> 01:56:26,460
我找到了你
...I tracked you down.

1381
01:56:26,496 --> 01:56:28,691
我不是特地去找你
I wasn't tryin' to track you down.

1382
01:56:28,732 --> 01:56:30,324
我本来想找的是...
I was tryin' to track down the fucking assholes I thought killed you.

1383
01:56:30,367 --> 01:56:34,201
我以为杀了你的混帐凶手

1384
01:56:34,237 --> 01:56:37,695
最后我找到了你
So I find you...

1385
01:56:37,741 --> 01:56:40,107
结果呢？
...and what do I find?

1386
01:56:40,143 --> 01:56:43,544
你不只没死
Not only are you not dead...

1387
01:56:43,580 --> 01:56:45,445
还要结婚了
...you're getting married to some fucking jerk.

1388
01:56:45,482 --> 01:56:49,714
嫁给一个该死的混蛋

1389
01:56:49,753 --> 01:56:52,119
而且你还怀孕了
And you're pregnant.

1390
01:56:55,692 --> 01:56:58,559
我反应过度了
I overreacted.

1391
01:57:06,703 --> 01:57:09,365
你反应过度了？
You overreacted? Is that your explanation?

1392
01:57:09,406 --> 01:57:10,600
这就是原因？
I didn't say I was gonna explain myself.

1393
01:57:10,640 --> 01:57:13,074
我不是在替自己辩解

1394
01:57:13,109 --> 01:57:16,044
我只是在陈述事实
I said I was gonna tell you the truth.

1395
01:57:16,079 --> 01:57:18,946
若这样说你还听不懂
But if that's too cryptic, let's get literal.

1396
01:57:18,982 --> 01:57:22,611
那就讲得白话一点

1397
01:57:22,652 --> 01:57:25,052
我是个杀手
I'm a killer.

1398
01:57:25,088 --> 01:57:28,546
我是个杀人魔，你心里有数
I'm a murdering bastard. You know that.

1399
01:57:28,591 --> 01:57:31,560
伤了杀人魔的心
And there are consequences...

1400
01:57:31,594 --> 01:57:35,223
要付出很大的代价
...to breaking the heart of a murdering bastard.

1401
01:57:35,965 --> 01:57:38,695
你已经付出一部份的代价了
You experienced some of them.

1402
01:57:41,938 --> 01:57:45,965
我的反应让你那么意外吗？
Was my reaction really that surprising?

1403
01:57:46,009 --> 01:57:50,002
没错
Yes. It was.

1404
01:57:51,714 --> 01:57:55,650
你能做之前做的那些事吗？
Could you do what you did?

1405
01:57:55,685 --> 01:57:59,314
当然可以
Of course you could.

1406
01:57:59,355 --> 01:58:01,585
但我做梦也没想到
But I never thought you would, or could, do that to me.

1407
01:58:01,624 --> 01:58:06,288
你会这样对我，或可能这样对我

1408
01:58:06,329 --> 01:58:08,923
我很抱歉，小妞儿
I'm really sorry, Kiddo...

1409
01:58:08,965 --> 01:58:11,729
你错看我了
...but you thought wrong.

1410
01:58:17,373 --> 01:58:21,400
我们还有旧债未清
You and I have unfinished business.

1411
01:58:22,445 --> 01:58:25,778
宝贝，你说得对极了
Baby... you ain't kiddin'.

1412
01:58:58,781 --> 01:59:00,214
白眉传授了你...
Pai Mei taught you the Five-Point-Palm Exploding-Heart Technique?

1413
01:59:00,250 --> 01:59:04,983
独门的五步穿心指？

1414
01:59:07,390 --> 01:59:09,290
没错
'Course he did.

1415
01:59:11,394 --> 01:59:13,954
你怎么没告诉我？
Why didn't you tell me?

1416
01:59:17,267 --> 01:59:19,895
我不知道
I don't know.

1417
01:59:21,905 --> 01:59:25,033
因为我...
Because I'm...

1418
01:59:25,074 --> 01:59:27,269
我是个坏人
...a bad person.

1419
01:59:27,977 --> 01:59:31,413
不对
No.

1420
01:59:31,447 --> 01:59:34,075
你不是坏人
You're not a bad person.

1421
01:59:34,717 --> 01:59:37,777
你是个大好人
You're a terrific person.

1422
01:59:37,820 --> 01:59:41,586
你是我最喜欢的人
You're my favorite person.

1423
01:59:42,525 --> 01:59:46,086
但偶尔也有时候
But every once in a while...

1424
01:59:46,129 --> 01:59:48,620
你实在是讨厌极了
...you can be a real cunt.

1425
02:00:07,750 --> 02:00:09,945
我看起来怎样？
How do I look?

1426
02:00:25,335 --> 02:00:27,599
你看起来准备好了
You look ready.

1427
02:02:10,773 --> 02:02:13,708
“隔天早上”

1428
02:02:14,327 --> 02:02:18,539
Well, well, well. If it ain't the little flower.

1429
02:02:16,346 --> 02:02:18,576
原来是一朵小花啊

1430
02:02:24,854 --> 02:02:26,981
各位美国人和海上的船只大家好
Good evening, Mr. and Mrs. America and all the ships at sea.

1431
02:02:27,023 --> 02:02:29,184
要报新闻了，新闻快报
Let's go to press. Flash.

1432
02:02:29,225 --> 02:02:31,955
你家里有喜鹊吗？
Do you have a magpie in your home?

1433
02:02:31,994 --> 02:02:34,326
若是有就恭喜你了
If you do, you are most fortunate.

1434
02:02:34,364 --> 02:02:38,027
喜鹊是全世界最可爱的小鸟
