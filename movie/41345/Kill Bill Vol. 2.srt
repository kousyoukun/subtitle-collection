1
00:00:14,128 --> 00:00:16,392
(man) Do you find me sadistic?

2
00:00:18,199 --> 00:00:20,531
You know, Kiddo...

3
00:00:20,601 --> 00:00:23,069
...I'd like to believe...

4
00:00:23,137 --> 00:00:26,573
...you're aware enough, even now...

5
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,804
...to know that there's nothing sadistic...

6
00:00:30,911 --> 00:00:33,038
...in my actions.

7
00:00:34,114 --> 00:00:37,572
At this moment...

8
00:00:37,685 --> 00:00:40,313
...this is me...

9
00:00:40,387 --> 00:00:43,015
...at my most masochistic.

10
00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:45,615
Bill.

11
00:00:45,693 --> 00:00:46,990
It's your ba...

12
00:00:52,099 --> 00:00:53,964
(woman) Looked dead, didn't I?

13
00:00:54,034 --> 00:00:55,695
Well, I wasn't.

14
00:00:55,769 --> 00:00:59,330
But it wasn't from lack of trying,
I can tell you that.

15
00:00:59,406 --> 00:01:02,534
Actually, Bill's last bullet
put me in a coma -

16
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:05,943
a coma I was to lie in for four years.

17
00:01:06,714 --> 00:01:11,151
When I woke up, I went on what
the movie advertisements refer to as

18
00:01:11,218 --> 00:01:14,676
"a roaring rampage of revenge."

19
00:01:14,788 --> 00:01:17,814
I roared, and I rampaged,

20
00:01:17,892 --> 00:01:21,453
and I got bloody satisfaction.

21
00:01:21,528 --> 00:01:25,362
I've killed a hell of a lot of people
to get to this point,

22
00:01:25,432 --> 00:01:28,697
but I've only one more.

23
00:01:28,769 --> 00:01:30,828
The last one.

24
00:01:30,905 --> 00:01:34,432
The one I'm driving to right now.

25
00:01:34,508 --> 00:01:37,341
The only one left.

26
00:01:37,444 --> 00:01:41,073
And when I arrive at my destination,

27
00:01:41,181 --> 00:01:44,378
I am gonna kill Bill.

28
00:01:44,451 --> 00:01:46,419
(# instrumental)

29
00:02:09,643 --> 00:02:13,101
(woman) The incident that happened
at the Two Pines Wedding Chapel

30
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:16,308
that put this whole gory story into motion

31
00:02:16,417 --> 00:02:19,045
has since become legend.

32
00:02:19,119 --> 00:02:21,815
"Massacre at Two Pines."

33
00:02:21,889 --> 00:02:23,880
That's what the newspapers called it.

34
00:02:23,958 --> 00:02:25,789
The local TVnews called it,

35
00:02:25,859 --> 00:02:29,852
"The El Paso, Texas
Wedding Chapel Massacre."

36
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:32,626
How it happened, who was there,

37
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:35,635
how many got killed
and who killed them -

38
00:02:35,703 --> 00:02:39,264
changes depending on
who's telling the story.

39
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:44,778
In actual fact, the massacre didn't
happen during a wedding at all.

40
00:02:44,878 --> 00:02:47,278
It was a wedding rehearsal.

41
00:02:47,348 --> 00:02:49,873
Now, when we come
to the part where I say,

42
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:54,216
"You may kiss the bride,"
you may kiss the bride.

43
00:02:54,288 --> 00:02:56,620
But don't stick your tongue in her mouth.

44
00:02:56,690 --> 00:02:58,681
(laughter)

45
00:02:58,759 --> 00:03:00,852
This might be funny to your friends,

46
00:03:00,928 --> 00:03:04,091
but it would be embarrassing
to your parents.

47
00:03:04,164 --> 00:03:05,756
(laughter continues)

48
00:03:05,833 --> 00:03:08,859
We'll try to restrain ourselves, Reverend.

49
00:03:10,137 --> 00:03:12,037
Y'all got a song?

50
00:03:15,542 --> 00:03:18,875
How 'bout "Love Me Tender"?
I can play that.

51
00:03:18,979 --> 00:03:20,947
- Sure.
- Yeah.

52
00:03:21,048 --> 00:03:23,380
"Love Me Tender" would be great.

53
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:26,544
Rufus - he's the man.

54
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:29,680
Rufus, who was that
that you used to play for?

55
00:03:29,757 --> 00:03:31,748
Rufus Thomas.

56
00:03:31,825 --> 00:03:34,726
Rufus Thomas.
Rufus Thomas.

57
00:03:34,795 --> 00:03:39,129
I was a Drell. I was a Drifter.
I was a Coaster.

58
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:42,794
I was part of the Gang.
I was a Barkay.

59
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:47,068
If they come through Texas,
I done played with 'em.

60
00:03:47,141 --> 00:03:50,599
Rufus - he's the man.

61
00:03:53,714 --> 00:03:55,875
- Have I forgotten anything?
- Um...

62
00:03:55,983 --> 00:03:59,441
Oh yes, you forgot, uh,
the seating arrangements.

63
00:03:59,553 --> 00:04:02,147
- Thank you, Mother.
- Yes.

64
00:04:02,222 --> 00:04:04,452
Now, the way we normally do this -

65
00:04:04,525 --> 00:04:08,621
we have the bride's side,
and then we have the groom's side.

66
00:04:08,695 --> 00:04:11,926
But since the bride
ain't got nobody comin',

67
00:04:11,999 --> 00:04:15,935
and the groom's got
far too many people comin'...

68
00:04:16,003 --> 00:04:19,268
Well, yeah, they're comin'
all the way from Oklahoma.

69
00:04:20,741 --> 00:04:22,208
Right...

70
00:04:22,276 --> 00:04:25,268
Well, I don't see no problem with...

71
00:04:25,379 --> 00:04:28,644
...the groom's side
sharing the bride's side.

72
00:04:28,715 --> 00:04:31,741
- Do you, Mother?
- I don't have a problem with that.

73
00:04:31,852 --> 00:04:33,581
But, uh...

74
00:04:33,654 --> 00:04:37,886
Honey, you know, it would be good
if you had somebody come.

75
00:04:37,958 --> 00:04:40,119
You know, as a sign of good faith?

76
00:04:41,995 --> 00:04:44,122
Well, I don't have anybody...

77
00:04:44,198 --> 00:04:48,134
...except for Tommy and my friends.

78
00:04:48,202 --> 00:04:52,639
- You have no family?
- Well, I'm workin' on changing that.

79
00:04:52,706 --> 00:04:56,972
Mrs. Harmony, we're all the family
this little angel's ever gonna need.

80
00:04:58,812 --> 00:05:02,680
I'm not feeling very well,
and this bitch is starting to piss me off.

81
00:05:02,783 --> 00:05:06,184
So while y'all blather on,
I'm gonna go outside and get some air.

82
00:05:06,253 --> 00:05:09,381
OK. Um, uh, Reverend, sorry, uh...

83
00:05:09,456 --> 00:05:13,085
- She's gonna go out and get some air.
- Yeah. Given her delicate condition...

84
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:15,822
She just needs a few minutes
to get it together. She'll be OK.

85
00:05:15,896 --> 00:05:18,330
(Reverend) Right...

(# flute)

87
00:06:35,442 --> 00:06:36,773
Hello, Kiddo.

88
00:06:42,182 --> 00:06:46,642
- How did you find me?
- I'm the man.

89
00:06:50,557 --> 00:06:53,492
What are you doin' here?

90
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:56,085
What am I doin'?

91
00:06:57,431 --> 00:06:59,524
Well...

92
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:02,865
...moment ago I was playin' my flute.

93
00:07:08,809 --> 00:07:11,903
At this moment...

94
00:07:12,012 --> 00:07:16,472
...l'm lookin' at the most beautiful bride
these old eyes have ever seen.

95
00:07:18,418 --> 00:07:21,945
- Why are you here?
- Last look.

96
00:07:24,658 --> 00:07:28,355
- Are you gonna be nice?
- I've never been nice in my whole life.

97
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:33,663
But I'll do my best to be sweet.

98
00:07:34,134 --> 00:07:35,931
Hmm.

99
00:07:36,003 --> 00:07:38,437
I always told you...

100
00:07:38,505 --> 00:07:41,838
...your sweet side is you best side.

101
00:07:41,908 --> 00:07:46,402
I guess that's why you're
the only one who's ever seen it.

102
00:07:48,849 --> 00:07:52,182
- So you got a bun in the oven.
- Hmm.

103
00:07:54,554 --> 00:07:57,717
- I'm knocked up.
- Jeez, Louise.

104
00:07:59,126 --> 00:08:04,325
That young man of yours sure doesn't
believe in wasting time, does he?

105
00:08:04,398 --> 00:08:06,958
Have you seen Tommy?

106
00:08:09,169 --> 00:08:12,297
- Big guy in the tux?
- Yes.

107
00:08:12,372 --> 00:08:14,499
Then I saw him.

108
00:08:15,709 --> 00:08:17,768
I like his hair.

109
00:08:19,146 --> 00:08:21,512
You promised you'd be nice.

110
00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:27,386
No, I said I'd do my best.
That's hardly a promise.

111
00:08:28,188 --> 00:08:30,486
But you're right.

112
00:08:30,557 --> 00:08:33,651
What does your young man
do for a living?

113
00:08:35,462 --> 00:08:38,397
He owns a used record store
here in El Paso.

114
00:08:38,465 --> 00:08:43,164
- Ah. Music lover, eh?
- He's fond of music.

115
00:08:44,304 --> 00:08:46,499
Aren't we all?

116
00:08:50,143 --> 00:08:53,943
And what are you doing
for a J-O-B these days?

117
00:08:55,549 --> 00:08:58,575
I work in the record store.

118
00:08:58,685 --> 00:09:02,052
Aso.

119
00:09:02,155 --> 00:09:05,215
It all suddenly seems so clear.

120
00:09:07,661 --> 00:09:12,064
- Do you like it?
- Yeah. I like it a lot, smartass.

121
00:09:13,233 --> 00:09:15,861
I get to listen to music all day...

122
00:09:15,936 --> 00:09:19,929
...talk about music all day.
It's really cool.

123
00:09:20,774 --> 00:09:24,437
It's gonna be a great environment
for my little girl to grow up in.

124
00:09:27,314 --> 00:09:32,013
As opposed to jetting around the world,
killing human beings,

125
00:09:32,085 --> 00:09:36,886
and being paid vast sums of money?

126
00:09:36,957 --> 00:09:38,288
Precisely.

127
00:09:38,358 --> 00:09:41,350
Well, my old friend...

128
00:09:41,428 --> 00:09:43,794
...to each his own.

129
00:09:43,864 --> 00:09:48,426
However, all cockblockery aside...

130
00:09:48,502 --> 00:09:51,960
I am looking forward
to meeting your young man.

131
00:09:52,038 --> 00:09:57,305
I happen to be, more or less,
particular whom my gal marries.

132
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:03,607
- You want to come to the wedding?
- Only if I can sit on the bride's side.

133
00:10:05,385 --> 00:10:07,819
You'll find it a bit lonely on my side.

134
00:10:07,888 --> 00:10:11,346
Your side always was a bit lonely.

135
00:10:12,092 --> 00:10:14,458
But I wouldn't sit anywhere else.

136
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:18,855
You know...

137
00:10:18,932 --> 00:10:21,400
...I had the loveliest dream about you...

138
00:10:21,468 --> 00:10:23,902
Oh, here's Tommy!
Call me Arlene.

139
00:10:24,704 --> 00:10:26,262
- You must be Tommy!
- Uh-huh.

140
00:10:26,339 --> 00:10:28,773
Arlene's told me so much about you.

141
00:10:28,842 --> 00:10:31,640
- Honey, you OK?
- Oh, I'm fine.

142
00:10:31,745 --> 00:10:34,805
Tommy, I'd like you to meet my father.

143
00:10:34,915 --> 00:10:37,645
Oh, my God!

144
00:10:37,717 --> 00:10:39,480
Oh, my God, this is great!

145
00:10:39,553 --> 00:10:42,351
I'm so glad to meet you, sir... uh, Dad.

146
00:10:42,422 --> 00:10:44,720
The name's Bill.

147
00:10:44,791 --> 00:10:47,123
Well, it's great to meet you... Bill.

148
00:10:47,194 --> 00:10:50,391
- Arlene told me you couldn't make it.
- Surprise.

149
00:10:50,464 --> 00:10:53,729
That's my pop for ya.
Always full of surprises.

150
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:57,201
Well, in the surprise department...

151
00:10:57,270 --> 00:11:00,637
...the apple doesn't fall far from the tree.

152
00:11:00,707 --> 00:11:02,868
- When did you get in?
- Just now.

153
00:11:02,943 --> 00:11:06,071
- Did you come straight from Australia?
- Of course.

154
00:11:06,179 --> 00:11:09,979
Daddy, I told Tommy that you were
in Perth mining for silver, and...

155
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:12,075
...no one could reach you.

156
00:11:12,185 --> 00:11:15,450
Lucky for us all, that's not the case.

157
00:11:15,522 --> 00:11:17,615
So...

158
00:11:17,691 --> 00:11:21,457
What's this all about?
I've heard of wedding rehearsals,

159
00:11:21,528 --> 00:11:25,760
but I don't believe I've ever heard of
a wedding dress rehearsal before.

160
00:11:25,832 --> 00:11:27,163
We thought,

161
00:11:27,234 --> 00:11:30,431
"Why pay so much money for a dress
you're only gonna wear once?"

162
00:11:30,504 --> 00:11:33,496
Especially when Arlene looks
so goddamn beautiful in it.

163
00:11:33,573 --> 00:11:37,304
So, I think we're gonna try to get
all the mileage we can out of it.

164
00:11:38,745 --> 00:11:42,010
Isn't it supposed to be bad luck
for the groom to see the bride

165
00:11:42,115 --> 00:11:45,107
in her wedding dress
before the ceremony?

166
00:11:45,919 --> 00:11:49,514
Well, I guess I just believe
in living dangerously.

167
00:11:51,358 --> 00:11:53,485
I know just what you mean.

168
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:56,757
(Reverend) Son.
Some of us have places to be.

169
00:11:56,830 --> 00:11:58,491
(Rufus) Sure do.

170
00:11:58,565 --> 00:12:02,934
Look, we got to go through this one
more time. So, why don't you have a s...

171
00:12:03,003 --> 00:12:06,996
Oh, my God. What am I thinking?
You should give her away!

172
00:12:07,073 --> 00:12:10,804
Tommy, that's not exactly
Daddy's cup of tea.

173
00:12:10,877 --> 00:12:13,368
I think Father would be
much more comfortable

174
00:12:13,446 --> 00:12:16,415
- sitting with the rest of the guests.
- Hmm. Really?

175
00:12:16,516 --> 00:12:18,484
That's asking a lot.

176
00:12:20,086 --> 00:12:22,782
Oh. OK.
Well, forget it.

177
00:12:22,856 --> 00:12:25,620
But how about we go out
to dinner tonight to celebrate?

178
00:12:25,692 --> 00:12:28,422
Only on the condition that
I pay for everything.

179
00:12:28,495 --> 00:12:31,089
Deal. We got to do this now.

180
00:12:31,164 --> 00:12:35,157
- Can I watch?
- Absolutely. Have a seat.

181
00:12:35,235 --> 00:12:38,204
- Which is the bride's side?
- Right over here.

182
00:12:41,908 --> 00:12:43,899
(Reverend) Mother, here we go!

183
00:12:45,612 --> 00:12:48,638
Now son, about them vows...

184
00:12:49,883 --> 00:12:52,681
(# guitar)

185
00:12:55,155 --> 00:12:57,419
Bill...

186
00:12:57,490 --> 00:13:01,984
- I just want...
- You don't owe me a damn thing.

187
00:13:02,062 --> 00:13:04,622
If he's the man you want...

188
00:13:04,698 --> 00:13:07,758
...then go stand by him.

189
00:13:31,224 --> 00:13:35,126
- Do I look pretty?
- Oh, yes.

190
00:13:45,972 --> 00:13:48,270
Thank you.

191
00:14:22,776 --> 00:14:24,300
(Reverend) What the hell?

192
00:14:24,377 --> 00:14:25,708
(screaming)

193
00:14:25,812 --> 00:14:27,780
(bride) No! Bill!

194
00:14:27,847 --> 00:14:30,111
(machine gunfire)

195
00:14:34,487 --> 00:14:36,114
(barking)

196
00:14:36,189 --> 00:14:38,623
(bells toll)

197
00:14:56,209 --> 00:14:58,200
(bird chirps)

198
00:15:05,852 --> 00:15:11,916
You tellin' me she cut her way through
88 bodyguards before she got to O-Ren?

199
00:15:13,159 --> 00:15:15,218
Nah, there wasn't really 88 of 'em.

200
00:15:15,295 --> 00:15:18,059
They just called themselves
"The Crazy 88"

201
00:15:18,131 --> 00:15:20,292
- How come?
- I don't know.

202
00:15:20,366 --> 00:15:23,529
I guess they thought it sounded cool.

203
00:15:23,603 --> 00:15:27,232
Anyhow, they all fell
under her Hanzo sword.

204
00:15:27,307 --> 00:15:31,300
- She got a Hanzo sword?
- He made one for her.

205
00:15:31,411 --> 00:15:34,847
Didn't he swear a blood oath
to never make another sword?

206
00:15:35,315 --> 00:15:38,512
It would appear he has broken it.

207
00:15:40,854 --> 00:15:44,415
Them Japs sure know how
to hold a grudge, don't they?

208
00:15:46,993 --> 00:15:48,551
Or maybe...

209
00:15:48,828 --> 00:15:52,025
...you just tend
to bring that out in people.

210
00:15:52,098 --> 00:15:56,797
I know this is a ridiculous question
before I ask it,

211
00:15:56,870 --> 00:16:01,466
but you haven't, by any chance,
kept up with your... swordplay?

212
00:16:03,943 --> 00:16:06,002
I, um...

213
00:16:06,112 --> 00:16:09,604
(belches) I pawned that years ago.

214
00:16:09,716 --> 00:16:13,049
You hocked a Hattori Hanzo sword?

215
00:16:13,953 --> 00:16:15,181
Yep.

216
00:16:15,255 --> 00:16:17,246
It was priceless.

217
00:16:21,895 --> 00:16:26,264
Well, not in El Paso, it ain't.

218
00:16:26,332 --> 00:16:29,324
In El Paso, I got me $250 for it.

219
00:16:31,037 --> 00:16:34,666
I'm a bouncer in a titty bar, Bill.

220
00:16:34,741 --> 00:16:36,971
(sniffs)

221
00:16:37,043 --> 00:16:39,944
If she wants to fight with me, all she's
got to do is come down to the club

222
00:16:40,046 --> 00:16:42,776
and start some shit,
and we'll be in a fight.

223
00:16:44,584 --> 00:16:49,351
I know we haven't spoken in some time,

224
00:16:49,422 --> 00:16:53,222
and the last time we spoke
wasn't the most pleasant,

225
00:16:53,293 --> 00:16:57,730
but you've got to get over
being mad at me,

226
00:16:57,797 --> 00:16:59,924
and start becoming afraid of (bleep),

227
00:16:59,999 --> 00:17:03,730
because she is coming,
and she's coming to kill you.

228
00:17:04,971 --> 00:17:09,101
And unless you accept my assistance,
I have no doubt she will succeed.

229
00:17:18,451 --> 00:17:23,047
I don't dodge guilt, and I don't Jew
out of paying my comeuppance.

230
00:17:25,291 --> 00:17:28,658
Can't we just... forget the past?

231
00:17:31,497 --> 00:17:33,556
That woman...

232
00:17:33,633 --> 00:17:36,830
...deserves her revenge.

233
00:17:40,707 --> 00:17:42,766
And...

234
00:17:42,842 --> 00:17:45,640
...we deserve to die.

235
00:17:49,949 --> 00:17:52,543
But then again...

236
00:17:52,652 --> 00:17:54,711
...so does she.

237
00:17:58,157 --> 00:18:00,751
So I guess...

238
00:18:00,827 --> 00:18:03,227
...we'll just see.

239
00:18:04,197 --> 00:18:07,394

There ain't nobody in here, man.

00:18:49,876 --> 00:18:52,208
- (man) Is that Budd?
- Yeah.

his fucking ass back here!

247

OK.

250
00:19:17,670 --> 00:19:19,729
You looking for me?

251
00:19:25,611 --> 00:19:29,274
I don't know what car wash
you worked before you came here

252
00:19:29,382 --> 00:19:32,681
that let you stroll in 20 minutes late,
but it wasn't owned by me

253
00:19:32,752 --> 00:19:35,414
- and I own a fuckin' car wash.
- Do you want me to leave?

254
00:19:35,488 --> 00:19:38,651
No, I don't want you to leave.
I want you to sit and wait.

255
00:19:38,725 --> 00:19:40,920
Larry...

256
00:19:40,994 --> 00:19:43,929
...there ain't nobody out there, so...

257
00:19:43,997 --> 00:19:49,458
(slurring) "There's nobody
out there, Larry."

258
00:19:49,535 --> 00:19:51,799
What's your point?

259
00:19:51,871 --> 00:19:56,467
- That you're not needed here?
- My point is...

260
00:19:56,542 --> 00:20:01,172
...l'm the bouncer, and there
ain't nobody out there to bounce.

261
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:04,511
You saying that the reason...

262
00:20:04,584 --> 00:20:08,418
...that you're not doing the job that I'm...

263
00:20:08,488 --> 00:20:12,982
...paying you to do is that
you don't have a job to do?

264
00:20:15,294 --> 00:20:17,592
- No...
- Is that what you're saying?

265
00:20:17,663 --> 00:20:19,597
What are you trying
to convince me of, exactly?

266
00:20:19,665 --> 00:20:23,624
That you're as useless
as an asshole right here?

267
00:20:23,703 --> 00:20:26,035
Well, guess what, buddy?

268
00:20:26,105 --> 00:20:31,304
I think... you just fucking convinced me.

269
00:20:31,377 --> 00:20:33,538
Let's go to the calendar.

270
00:20:33,646 --> 00:20:35,876
It's calendar time.

271
00:20:35,982 --> 00:20:38,473
Calendar time for Buddy.

272
00:20:38,584 --> 00:20:41,951
- OK. You working tomorrow?
- Yeah.

273
00:20:42,021 --> 00:20:46,117
Mm. No, you're n... You don't even know
what fucking day you work.

Here you are. There you go.

- Workin' Thursday?
- Yeah.

00:20:53,699 --> 00:20:57,999
I don't think so.

00:21:00,139 --> 00:21:03,108
- If you say so.
- There used to be your name. OK?

280
00:21:03,176 --> 00:21:06,009
- Saturday. There used to be your name.
- Oh.

281
00:21:06,112 --> 00:21:08,103
Uh, Monday...

282
00:21:08,214 --> 00:21:09,681
Here. How about that?

283
00:21:09,782 --> 00:21:14,549
Fuckin' with your cash is the only thing
you kids seem to understand. OK?

284
00:21:16,055 --> 00:21:18,250

Before you leave, talk to Rocket.
She's got a job for you to do.

And...

288
00:21:29,202 --> 00:21:31,932
...the hat.

289

291

How many times have I told you,

292
00:21:40,913 --> 00:21:44,872
don't wear that fucking hat here?
How many?

293
00:21:49,455 --> 00:21:50,922
Customers wear hats.

294
00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:53,652
Well, I'm not the boss of the customers.

295
00:21:53,726 --> 00:21:57,685
I'm the boss of you.
And I'm telling you...

296
00:21:57,763 --> 00:22:02,632
...that I want you to keep
that shit-kicker hat at home.

There's shitty water all over the floor.

301
00:22:43,476 --> 00:22:47,276
OK... Rocket.

302
00:22:49,182 --> 00:22:51,980
- I'll clean it up.

00:41:53,258 --> 00:41:59,060
...the Massacre of the Shaolin Temple,
and all sixty of the monks inside,

486
00:41:59,130 --> 00:42:02,588
at the fists of the White Lotus.

487
00:42:02,667 --> 00:42:06,467
And... so began the legend...

488
00:42:06,538 --> 00:42:10,941
...of Pai Mei's Five-Point-Palm
Exploding-Heart Technique.

489
00:42:11,009 --> 00:42:13,239
And what, pray tell,
is the Five-Point-Palm

490
00:42:13,345 --> 00:42:15,939
- Exploding-Heart Technique?
- Quite simply,

491
00:42:16,748 --> 00:42:21,117
the deadliest blow in all of martial arts.

492
00:42:22,554 --> 00:42:26,115
He hits you with his fingertips...

493
00:42:26,191 --> 00:42:30,127
...at five different pressure
points on your body...

494
00:42:30,195 --> 00:42:34,222
...and then lets you walk away.

495
00:42:34,299 --> 00:42:37,268
But once you've taken five steps...

496
00:42:37,335 --> 00:42:41,362
...your heart explodes inside your body...

497
00:42:41,439 --> 00:42:44,533
...and you fall to the floor, dead.

498
00:42:45,677 --> 00:42:47,702
- Did he teach you that?
- No.

499
00:42:49,781 --> 00:42:54,047
He teaches no one the Five-Point-Palm
Exploding-Heart Technique.

500
00:42:54,853 --> 00:42:57,185
Now...

501
00:42:57,255 --> 00:43:00,520
...one of the things
I've always liked about you...

502
00:43:00,592 --> 00:43:02,583
...Kiddo...

503
00:43:03,862 --> 00:43:07,025
...is you appear
wise beyond your years.

504
00:43:10,702 --> 00:43:15,332
So, allow me to impart
a word to the wise:

505
00:43:15,407 --> 00:43:17,034
Whatever...

506
00:43:17,108 --> 00:43:21,067
...whatever Pai Mei says, obey.

507
00:43:22,514 --> 00:43:27,645
If you flash him, even for an instant,
a defiant eye, he'll pluck it out.

508
00:43:28,386 --> 00:43:32,948
And if you throw any
American sass his way...

509
00:43:33,024 --> 00:43:36,221
...he'll snap your back and your neck
like they were twigs.

510
00:43:39,664 --> 00:43:42,462
And that will be the story of you.

511
00:43:45,203 --> 00:43:48,229
(# flute)

512
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:05,280
He'll accept you as his student.

513
00:44:05,356 --> 00:44:07,449
- What happened to you?
- Nothin'.

514
00:44:07,525 --> 00:44:10,688
- Get in a fight?
- Friendly contest.

515
00:44:10,762 --> 00:44:12,195
Why did he accept me?

516
00:44:12,263 --> 00:44:16,529
Because he's a very, very, very old man.

517
00:44:16,601 --> 00:44:19,832
And like all rotten bastards...

518
00:44:19,904 --> 00:44:25,069
...when they become old,
they get lonely.

519
00:44:25,143 --> 00:44:28,135
Which has no effect
on their dispositions,

520
00:44:28,213 --> 00:44:32,946
but it does teach them
the value of company.

521
00:44:33,017 --> 00:44:35,485
Whew. Oh.

522
00:44:35,587 --> 00:44:40,490
(sighs) Just seein' those
steps again makes me ache.

523
00:44:41,125 --> 00:44:42,456
You're gonna have a lot of fun

524
00:44:42,527 --> 00:44:46,395
carrying buckets of water
up and down that fucker.

525
00:44:50,902 --> 00:44:52,961
When will I see you again?

526
00:44:53,037 --> 00:44:56,529
That's the title of my favorite
soul song of the seventies.

527
00:44:56,608 --> 00:44:58,405
- What?
- Nothin'.

528
00:44:58,476 --> 00:45:00,910
When he tells me you're done.

529
00:45:01,980 --> 00:45:03,641
When do you think that might be?

530
00:45:03,748 --> 00:45:06,683
That, my dearest,
depends entirely on you.

531
00:45:06,751 --> 00:45:10,380
Now remember,
no sarcasm, no backtalk.

532
00:45:10,455 --> 00:45:12,753
At least not for the first year or so.

533
00:45:12,824 --> 00:45:16,021
You're gonna have to let him
warm up to you.

534
00:45:16,094 --> 00:45:19,928
He hates Caucasians,
despises Americans,

535
00:45:19,998 --> 00:45:22,796
and has nothing
but contempt for women.

536
00:45:25,169 --> 00:45:28,570
So in your case...
it might take a little while.

537
00:45:29,574 --> 00:45:32,270
- Adiós.
- (engine starts)

538
00:47:11,576 --> 00:47:12,668
Master...

539
00:47:14,545 --> 00:47:16,206
Your Mandarin is lousy.

540
00:47:17,215 --> 00:47:18,580
It causes my ears discomfort.

541
00:47:18,650 --> 00:47:20,208
You bray like an ass!

542
00:47:21,052 --> 00:47:23,179
You are not to speak unless spoken to.

543
00:47:24,088 --> 00:47:27,683
Is it too much to hope...
you understand Cantonese?

544
00:47:31,429 --> 00:47:32,828
I speak Japanese very well...

545
00:47:32,897 --> 00:47:36,196
I didn't ask if you speak Japanese...

546
00:47:36,267 --> 00:47:38,428
I asked if you understand Cantonese?

547
00:47:39,971 --> 00:47:40,960
A little.

548
00:47:41,639 --> 00:47:46,235
You are here to learn the mysteries
of Kung Fu, not linguistics.

549
00:47:46,644 --> 00:47:48,737
If you can't understand me...

550
00:47:48,846 --> 00:47:50,313
I will communicate with you
like I would a dog.

551
00:47:50,648 --> 00:47:54,106
When I yell, when I point,
when I beat you with my stick!

552
00:48:00,158 --> 00:48:02,023
Bill is your master, is he not?

553
00:48:03,928 --> 00:48:05,418
Yes, he is.

554
00:48:07,765 --> 00:48:11,565
Your master tells me...
you're not entirely unschooled.

555
00:48:12,503 --> 00:48:13,868
What training do you possess?

556
00:48:14,772 --> 00:48:17,366
I am proficient in Tiger-Crane Style,

557
00:48:17,442 --> 00:48:21,435
and I am more than proficient in the
exquisite art of the Samurai sword.

558
00:48:21,546 --> 00:48:22,740
(scoffs)

559
00:48:22,847 --> 00:48:25,315
The exquisite art of the Samurai sword.
Don't make me laugh!

560
00:48:25,883 --> 00:48:30,479
Your so-called exquisite art,
is only fit for...

561
00:48:30,822 --> 00:48:32,414
Japanese fat heads!

562
00:48:32,990 --> 00:48:34,981
(laughs)

563
00:48:37,562 --> 00:48:42,693
Your anger amuses me.
Do you believe you are my match?

564
00:48:43,234 --> 00:48:43,825
No.

565
00:48:44,669 --> 00:48:46,637
Are you aware I kill at will?

566
00:48:47,305 --> 00:48:48,363
Yes.

567
00:48:48,873 --> 00:48:50,272
Is it your wish to die?

568
00:48:50,675 --> 00:48:51,039
No.

569
00:48:51,242 --> 00:48:53,142
(laughs)

570
00:48:53,244 --> 00:48:54,212
Then you must be stupid...

571
00:48:54,212 --> 00:48:56,612
Then you must be stupid... so stupid.

572
00:48:56,681 --> 00:49:00,344
Rise, and let me look at your
ridiculous face.

573
00:49:00,852 --> 00:49:02,012
Rise.

574
00:49:06,557 --> 00:49:12,154
So my pathetic friend...
Is there anything that you can do well?

575
00:49:13,030 --> 00:49:14,964
What's the matter?

576
00:49:15,399 --> 00:49:17,333
Cat got your tongue?

577
00:49:18,803 --> 00:49:21,772
- Oh yes, you speak Japanese.

578
00:49:22,406 --> 00:49:23,839
I despise the Goddamn Japs!

579
00:49:26,911 --> 00:49:28,606
Go to that rack.

580
00:49:36,954 --> 00:49:37,921
Remove the sword.

581
00:49:44,395 --> 00:49:46,989
(whooshes)

582
00:50:04,282 --> 00:50:06,079
Let's see how good you really are.

583
00:50:06,951 --> 00:50:08,578
lf...

584
00:50:09,253 --> 00:50:10,948
...you land a single blow,

585
00:50:12,690 --> 00:50:14,419
I'll bow down and call you master.

586
00:50:15,159 --> 00:50:17,389
(whipping)

587
00:50:19,263 --> 00:50:21,197
(grunts)

588
00:50:21,265 --> 00:50:22,789
(grunts)

589
00:50:25,970 --> 00:50:27,130
(grunting)

590
00:50:28,673 --> 00:50:31,073
From here you can get
an excellent view of my foot.

591
00:50:31,209 --> 00:50:32,233
(thud)

592
00:50:33,678 --> 00:50:35,669
(laughs)

593
00:50:36,347 --> 00:50:39,680
Your swordsmanship...
is amateur at best.

594
00:50:39,884 --> 00:50:41,283
(whipping)

595
00:50:45,289 --> 00:50:47,154
(grunting)

596
00:50:53,831 --> 00:50:59,167
Your so-called kung-fu... is really...
quite pathetic.

597
00:51:01,939 --> 00:51:05,739
I asked you to demonstrate...
what you know... and you did...

598
00:51:06,444 --> 00:51:07,638
Not a goddamn thing!

599
00:51:08,746 --> 00:51:12,341
Let's see your Tiger Crane...
match my Eagle's Claw.

600
00:51:14,819 --> 00:51:16,514
(whooshes)

601
00:51:27,098 --> 00:51:29,532
(grunting)

602
00:51:36,374 --> 00:51:37,841
(grunts)

603
00:51:45,149 --> 00:51:47,640
(grunting)

604
00:51:48,286 --> 00:51:51,084
(grunts/laughs)

605
00:51:57,795 --> 00:51:59,319
(grunting continues)

606
00:51:59,997 --> 00:52:01,225
(laughs)

607
00:52:03,834 --> 00:52:05,324
(screams)

608
00:52:07,905 --> 00:52:09,429
(screams)

609
00:52:09,507 --> 00:52:11,475
Like all Yankee women...

610
00:52:11,542 --> 00:52:15,034
...all you can do is order in restaurants
and spend a man's money.

611
00:52:16,213 --> 00:52:17,805
Excruciating... isn't it?

612
00:52:17,915 --> 00:52:19,143
Yes!

613
00:52:20,751 --> 00:52:22,082
If it was my wish...

614
00:52:22,586 --> 00:52:23,917
...I could chop your arm off.

615
00:52:23,988 --> 00:52:25,250
No, please don't!

616
00:52:25,323 --> 00:52:26,654
(laughs)

617
00:52:26,724 --> 00:52:29,022
It's my arm now. I can do what I please.

618
00:52:29,660 --> 00:52:31,890
If you can stop me... I suggest you try.

619
00:52:31,963 --> 00:52:34,056
(screams)

620
00:52:34,131 --> 00:52:35,120
I can't.

621
00:52:36,300 --> 00:52:37,528
Because you're helpless?

622
00:52:38,402 --> 00:52:39,300
Yes.

623
00:52:41,939 --> 00:52:44,032
Have you ever felt this before?

624
00:52:44,442 --> 00:52:45,238
No.

625
00:52:45,609 --> 00:52:48,908
Compared to me... you're as helpless
as a worm fighting an eagle?

626
00:52:49,947 --> 00:52:51,107
YES!!!

627
00:52:53,351 --> 00:52:54,079
THAT'S THE BEGINNING!

628
00:52:59,824 --> 00:53:02,418
Is it your wish to possess
this kind of power?

629
00:53:05,129 --> 00:53:06,721
Yes!

630
00:53:08,299 --> 00:53:11,063
Your training will begin... tomorrow.

631
00:53:17,308 --> 00:53:19,173
(yells)

632
00:53:19,844 --> 00:53:21,209
Since your arm now belongs to me...

633
00:53:22,146 --> 00:53:23,408
...I want it strong.

634
00:53:25,016 --> 00:53:26,415
Can you do that?

635
00:53:28,119 --> 00:53:29,780
I can, but not that close.

636
00:53:29,954 --> 00:53:31,251
Then you can't do it.

637
00:53:32,490 --> 00:53:36,256
What if your enemy...
is three inches in front of you...

638
00:53:37,328 --> 00:53:38,590
...What do you do then...

639
00:53:39,730 --> 00:53:40,822
...Curl into a ball...

640
00:53:42,500 --> 00:53:43,762
...or do you put your FIST through him?

641
00:53:45,336 --> 00:53:46,098
Now begin.

642
00:53:56,580 --> 00:53:57,808
(grunts)

643
00:53:59,550 --> 00:54:01,177
(grunts)

644
00:54:09,560 --> 00:54:11,528
(grunts)

645
00:54:13,230 --> 00:54:14,720
(grunts)

646
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:17,427
(groans)

647
00:54:18,302 --> 00:54:19,826
It's the wood that should
fear your hand...

648
00:54:19,904 --> 00:54:22,372
- not the other way around.

649
00:54:23,174 --> 00:54:27,440
No wonder you can't do it...
you acquiesce to defeat...

650
00:54:27,545 --> 00:54:28,944
- before you even begin.

651
00:54:29,580 --> 00:54:31,013
(scoffs)

652
00:54:44,095 --> 00:54:46,029
(grunting)

653
00:54:47,631 --> 00:54:49,360
(continues grunting)

654
00:54:52,436 --> 00:54:54,427
(grunting)

655
00:55:05,316 --> 00:55:08,012
(continues grunting)

656
00:55:10,621 --> 00:55:12,816
(gasping)

657
00:55:22,633 --> 00:55:25,101
(grunting)

658
00:55:27,705 --> 00:55:29,900
(yelling)

659
00:55:37,815 --> 00:55:40,875
(continues yelling)

660
00:55:43,287 --> 00:55:45,551
(rainfall)

661
00:56:09,914 --> 00:56:10,881
(chopsticks fall)

662
00:56:17,421 --> 00:56:19,651
If you want to eat like a dog...

663
00:56:20,925 --> 00:56:22,916
You can live and sleep
outside like a dog.

664
00:56:25,429 --> 00:56:27,329
If you want to live and sleep
like a human...

665
00:56:28,933 --> 00:56:30,423
...pick up those sticks.

666
00:57:02,433 --> 00:57:04,401
(sighs)

667
00:57:11,075 --> 00:57:13,236
(sighs)

668
00:57:23,988 --> 00:57:25,819
(whoosh)

669
00:58:18,609 --> 00:58:20,167
(grunts)

670
00:59:05,489 --> 00:59:07,389
(grunts)

671
01:00:01,378 --> 01:00:04,973
Come on, you bitch.

672
01:00:06,683 --> 01:00:07,980
(grunts)

673
01:00:46,023 --> 01:00:48,651
OK, Pai Mei.

674
01:00:50,861 --> 01:00:53,193
Here I come.

675
01:00:55,866 --> 01:00:59,666
(grunting)

676
01:01:30,501 --> 01:01:32,230
(grunting faster)

677
01:02:01,532 --> 01:02:04,763
(gasping)

678
01:02:06,670 --> 01:02:08,729
(wheezing)

679
01:02:17,981 --> 01:02:19,972
(grunts)

680
01:02:21,118 --> 01:02:23,245
(gasping)

681
01:02:29,259 --> 01:02:32,092
(wheezing)

682
01:02:33,864 --> 01:02:36,833
(breathing softly)

683
01:02:52,816 --> 01:02:54,477
(chimes)

684
01:03:01,758 --> 01:03:05,888
May I have a glass of water, please?

685
01:03:28,051 --> 01:03:29,416
(screeching)

686
01:05:43,053 --> 01:05:46,489
- So that's a Texas funeral?
- Yep.

687
01:05:48,091 --> 01:05:50,389
I have to give it to ya, Budd.

688
01:05:50,460 --> 01:05:53,554
That's a pretty fucked up way to die.

689
01:05:53,630 --> 01:05:56,064
What's the name on the grave
she's buried under?

690
01:05:56,933 --> 01:05:58,730
Paula...

691
01:06:00,237 --> 01:06:02,262
...Schultz.

692
01:06:07,611 --> 01:06:09,010
Can I look at the sword?

693
01:06:09,112 --> 01:06:12,639
That's my money right there
in that red bag, isn't it?

694
01:06:12,749 --> 01:06:15,445
It sure is.

695
01:06:15,519 --> 01:06:17,919
Well then, it's your sword now.

696
01:06:34,137 --> 01:06:35,900
(blender whirring)

697
01:06:37,207 --> 01:06:39,141
What's that you said?

698
01:06:39,209 --> 01:06:41,609
So this is a Hattori Hanzo sword?

699
01:06:41,711 --> 01:06:44,009
That's a Hanzo sword, all right.

700
01:06:44,114 --> 01:06:46,878
Bill tells me you once had
one of these of your own.

701
01:06:48,451 --> 01:06:50,419
Yeah, once.

702
01:06:50,520 --> 01:06:53,284
Yeah? How does this one
compare to that?

703
01:07:02,332 --> 01:07:05,859
If you're gonna compare
a Hanzo sword...

704
01:07:07,470 --> 01:07:11,270
...you compare it
to every other sword ever made -

705
01:07:11,341 --> 01:07:16,244
wasn't made - by Hattori Hanzo.

706
01:07:21,318 --> 01:07:23,548
(sniffs/clears throat)

707
01:07:24,120 --> 01:07:27,055
Here you go.
Wrap your lips around that.

708
01:07:36,666 --> 01:07:39,191
So...

709
01:07:39,269 --> 01:07:41,760
...which "R" are you filled with?

710
01:07:42,539 --> 01:07:44,530
What?

711
01:07:47,110 --> 01:07:49,135
They say...

712
01:07:49,246 --> 01:07:51,407
...the number one killer...

713
01:07:51,514 --> 01:07:53,505
...of old people...

714
01:07:53,617 --> 01:07:56,950
...is retirement.

715
01:07:57,020 --> 01:08:02,959
People got a job to do, they tend to live
a little bit longer so they can do it.

716
01:08:04,561 --> 01:08:06,893
I've always figured that...

717
01:08:06,963 --> 01:08:10,023
...warriors and their enemies...

718
01:08:10,100 --> 01:08:12,762
...share the same relationship.

719
01:08:12,836 --> 01:08:16,203
So now that you're not gonna have
to face your enemy no more

720
01:08:16,273 --> 01:08:18,400
on the battlefield...

721
01:08:19,509 --> 01:08:22,501
...which "R" ya filled with?

722
01:08:24,347 --> 01:08:26,315
Relief...

723
01:08:28,952 --> 01:08:30,715
...or regret?

724
01:08:32,422 --> 01:08:36,791
- A little bit of both.
- Horseshit.

725
01:08:38,028 --> 01:08:40,895
I'm sure you do feel a little bit of both.

726
01:08:41,631 --> 01:08:44,725
But I know damn well that you feel one...

727
01:08:44,801 --> 01:08:47,429
...more than you feel the other.

728
01:08:47,504 --> 01:08:51,634
And the question was:
Which one is it?

729
01:08:53,777 --> 01:08:55,005
Regret.

730
01:08:56,813 --> 01:08:59,247
You know,
you gotta hand it to the ol' girl.

731
01:08:59,316 --> 01:09:04,117
I never saw anybody buffalo Bill
the way she buffaloed Bill.

732
01:09:04,187 --> 01:09:06,280
Bill thought she was so damn smart.

733
01:09:06,356 --> 01:09:08,722
And I tried to tell him...

734
01:09:08,792 --> 01:09:10,987
...she was just smart for a blond.

735
01:09:30,246 --> 01:09:31,975
Thanks a bunch.

736
01:09:38,788 --> 01:09:41,757
(sniffs/clears throat)

737
01:09:41,825 --> 01:09:44,385
(chuckles)

738
01:09:44,461 --> 01:09:46,326
All right.

739
01:09:46,396 --> 01:09:49,092
(hissing)

740
01:09:49,165 --> 01:09:51,793
(screaming)

741
01:10:01,444 --> 01:10:03,435
(continues screaming)

742
01:10:16,059 --> 01:10:18,619
Mmm.

743
01:10:18,695 --> 01:10:20,595
I'm sorry, Budd.

744
01:10:20,663 --> 01:10:23,291
That was rude of me, wasn't it?

745
01:10:23,366 --> 01:10:26,893
Budd, I'd like to introduce my friend,
the black mamba.

746
01:10:26,970 --> 01:10:29,962
Black mamba, this is Budd.

747
01:10:30,040 --> 01:10:32,508
You know, before I picked
that little fella up,

748
01:10:32,575 --> 01:10:34,839
I looked him up on the Internet.

749
01:10:34,944 --> 01:10:38,107
Fascinating creature, the black mamba.

750
01:10:38,214 --> 01:10:39,579
Listen to this:

751
01:10:40,884 --> 01:10:41,851
(groans)

752
01:10:44,954 --> 01:10:47,184
"In Africa, the saying goes,

753
01:10:47,257 --> 01:10:51,455
"'ln the bush, an elephant can kill you,
a leopard can kill you,

754
01:10:51,528 --> 01:10:55,555
"'and a black mamba can kill you.
But only with the mamba,

755
01:10:55,632 --> 01:11:00,001
"and this has been true in Africa
since the dawn of time, is death sure.'

756
01:11:00,070 --> 01:11:05,804
Hence its handle, 'Death Incarnate."'
Pretty cool, huh?

757
01:11:08,344 --> 01:11:12,075
"lts neurotoxic venom is one of
nature's most effective poisons,

758
01:11:12,182 --> 01:11:15,515
"acting on the nervous system,
causing paralysis.

759
01:11:15,585 --> 01:11:19,112
"The venom of a black mamba
can kill a human being in four hours

760
01:11:19,189 --> 01:11:21,919
"if, say, bitten on the ankle or the thumb.

761
01:11:21,991 --> 01:11:25,427
"However, a bite to the face or torso

762
01:11:25,495 --> 01:11:29,124
can bring death from paralysis
within 20 minutes."

763
01:11:29,199 --> 01:11:32,430
Now, you should listen to this,
'cause this concerns you.

764
01:11:34,270 --> 01:11:37,103
"The amount of venom that can be
delivered from a single bite

765
01:11:37,173 --> 01:11:40,370
can be gargantuan."

766
01:11:40,443 --> 01:11:43,003
You know, I've always liked
that word, "gargantuan."

767
01:11:43,113 --> 01:11:45,673
I so rarely have an opportunity
to use it in a sentence.

768
01:11:47,016 --> 01:11:49,382
"If not treated quickly with antivenom,

769
01:11:49,452 --> 01:11:52,285
"ten to 15 milligrams
can be fatal to human beings.

770
01:11:52,355 --> 01:11:54,915
"However, the black mamba can deliver

771
01:11:54,991 --> 01:11:59,792
as much as 100 to 400 milligrams
of venom from a single bite."

772
01:12:02,932 --> 01:12:05,901
Now...

773
01:12:05,969 --> 01:12:10,497
...in these last agonizing
minutes of life you have left,

774
01:12:10,573 --> 01:12:13,508
let me answer that question
you asked earlier more thoroughly.

775
01:12:17,380 --> 01:12:19,940
Right at this moment...

776
01:12:20,049 --> 01:12:23,678
...the biggest "R" I feel is regret.

777
01:12:25,455 --> 01:12:31,257
Regret that maybe
the greatest warrior I have ever met

778
01:12:31,327 --> 01:12:37,459
met her end at the hands
of a bushwhackin', scrub,

779
01:12:37,534 --> 01:12:41,402
alkie, piece of shit like you.

780
01:12:43,373 --> 01:12:45,637
That woman deserved better.

781
01:12:45,708 --> 01:12:48,575
(moans/stops moaning)

782
01:13:25,415 --> 01:13:26,643
(cell phone rings)

783
01:13:29,752 --> 01:13:30,844
Bill...

784
01:13:32,522 --> 01:13:34,513
...I have some tragic news.

785
01:13:35,725 --> 01:13:38,592
Your brother's dead.

786
01:13:38,661 --> 01:13:40,458
I am so sorry, baby.

787
01:13:41,598 --> 01:13:44,032
She put a black mamba in his camper.

788
01:13:45,068 --> 01:13:46,968
I got her, sweetie.
She's dead.

789
01:13:50,106 --> 01:13:51,971
Let me put it this way:

790
01:13:52,041 --> 01:13:56,375
You ever start feeling sentimental,
go to Barstow, California.

791
01:13:56,479 --> 01:14:00,313
When you get here, walk into a florist
and buy a bunch of flowers.

792
01:14:00,383 --> 01:14:03,284
Then you take those flowers
to Huntington Cemetery

793
01:14:03,353 --> 01:14:07,722
on Fuller and Guadalupe, look for
the headstone marked "Paula Schultz,"

794
01:14:07,790 --> 01:14:09,781
and lay them on the grave.

795
01:14:09,859 --> 01:14:15,798
'Cause you will be standing at the final
resting place of Beatrix Kiddo.

796
01:14:15,865 --> 01:14:18,356
- Marty Kitrosser?
- Here.

797
01:14:18,434 --> 01:14:20,265
- Melanie Harrhouse?
- Here.

798
01:14:20,336 --> 01:14:22,804
- Beatrix Kiddo?
- Here.

799
01:14:22,872 --> 01:14:26,239
Look... I can be there
in about four hours.

800
01:14:26,309 --> 01:14:28,800
Do you want me to come over?

801
01:14:28,911 --> 01:14:32,176
No, no, no, no.
You need me, baby, I'm there.

802
01:14:35,051 --> 01:14:37,849
OK. I'm leaving now.

803
01:14:37,920 --> 01:14:41,083
You go smoke some pot or somethin',
I'll be there soon.

804
01:14:56,072 --> 01:14:58,404
(grunting)

805
01:15:08,318 --> 01:15:10,343
(grunting continues)

806
01:15:14,724 --> 01:15:16,521
(grunting continues)

807
01:15:42,552 --> 01:15:44,486
Ugh.

808
01:15:44,554 --> 01:15:45,919
Gross.

809
01:16:06,142 --> 01:16:09,077
(yelling)

810
01:16:42,512 --> 01:16:43,536
(grunts)

811
01:16:57,460 --> 01:16:59,257
Hi-ya!

812
01:17:09,005 --> 01:17:13,806
"To my brother, Budd.
The only man I ever loved. Bill."

813
01:17:25,521 --> 01:17:27,751
What's that?

814
01:17:29,292 --> 01:17:31,726
Budd's Hanzo sword.

815
01:17:31,794 --> 01:17:34,285
He said he pawned it.

816
01:17:34,363 --> 01:17:37,992
Guess that makes him
a liar now, don't it?

817
01:17:41,671 --> 01:17:44,333
- Elle?
- Bea.

818
01:17:45,308 --> 01:17:48,368
Somethin' I've always
been curious about.

819
01:17:48,444 --> 01:17:52,107
Just between us girls...

820
01:17:52,215 --> 01:17:56,618
...what did you say to Pai Mei
to make him snatch out your eye?

821
01:17:56,686 --> 01:17:59,416
(screams) Ow!

822
01:18:00,356 --> 01:18:03,553
I called him a miserable old fool.

823
01:18:03,626 --> 01:18:07,722
Ooh. Bad idea.

824
01:18:08,898 --> 01:18:10,559
Know what I did?

825
01:18:11,267 --> 01:18:14,828
I killed that miserable old fool.

826
01:18:16,072 --> 01:18:19,701
(EIle) How do you like the fish head,
you miserable old fool?

827
01:18:19,775 --> 01:18:22,175
I poisoned his fish heads.

828
01:18:22,278 --> 01:18:25,714
Elle, you treacherous dog.

829
01:18:25,815 --> 01:18:28,716
(EIle laughs)

830
01:18:30,353 --> 01:18:32,651
I - give - you - my - word...

831
01:18:32,722 --> 01:18:34,246
(EIle) And I told him,

832
01:18:34,323 --> 01:18:38,225
"To me, the word
of an old fool like you

833
01:18:38,294 --> 01:18:42,355
is worth less than nothing."

834
01:18:42,431 --> 01:18:43,921
(laughs)

835
01:18:47,270 --> 01:18:49,238
That's right.

836
01:18:49,305 --> 01:18:51,273
I killed your master.

837
01:18:51,340 --> 01:18:53,968
And now I'm gonna kill you, too.

838
01:18:54,043 --> 01:18:56,705
With your own sword, no less.

839
01:18:56,812 --> 01:19:03,047
Which, in the very immediate future,
will become my sword.

840
01:19:05,187 --> 01:19:07,246
Bitch...

841
01:19:07,323 --> 01:19:09,917
...you don't have a future.

842
01:19:38,888 --> 01:19:41,516
(yelling)

843
01:19:52,335 --> 01:19:55,736
(screaming)

844
01:19:59,208 --> 01:20:01,540
(screaming) Fucking bitch!

845
01:20:03,746 --> 01:20:05,941
(screaming) Fucking bitch!

846
01:20:13,623 --> 01:20:16,854
(screaming) I'll kill you!
You're fuckin' dead!

847
01:20:19,729 --> 01:20:22,391
(screaming) You bitch! You bitch!

848
01:20:22,465 --> 01:20:25,992
(moaning/screaming)

849
01:20:26,068 --> 01:20:29,196
I'll fucking kill you, you bitch!

850
01:20:29,271 --> 01:20:31,671
(hisses)

851
01:20:31,741 --> 01:20:36,110
(screaming) Oh, I'll get you!

852
01:20:36,212 --> 01:20:39,147
I'm gonna...

853
01:20:39,215 --> 01:20:42,207
(screaming) Where are you?
Lemme fuckin' at you!

854
01:20:42,318 --> 01:20:44,286
(continues screaming)

855
01:20:44,353 --> 01:20:48,153
Where are you?
I'm coming, you fucking bitch!

856
01:20:48,224 --> 01:20:51,091
(screaming) You're fucking dead!
You're dead!

857
01:20:51,160 --> 01:20:53,560
(continues screaming)

858
01:20:53,629 --> 01:20:56,427
(cries) Oh... shit!

859
01:20:59,201 --> 01:21:02,534
(screaming)

860
01:21:02,605 --> 01:21:06,666
(wind blowing)

861
01:21:18,621 --> 01:21:22,216
(# choral music)

862
01:21:57,293 --> 01:21:59,659
(# male singing in Spanish)

863
01:22:23,753 --> 01:22:26,051
(the bride) Like most men
who never knew their father,

864
01:22:26,122 --> 01:22:28,886
Bill collected father figures.

865
01:22:28,958 --> 01:22:31,950
The first was Esteban Vihaio.

866
01:22:32,027 --> 01:22:36,088
Esteban was a pimp
and a friend of Bill's mother.

867
01:22:36,165 --> 01:22:40,261
He ran a brothel in Acuna, Mexico
for over 50 years.

868
01:22:40,336 --> 01:22:42,668
His army, the Acuna Boys,

869
01:22:42,738 --> 01:22:47,107
made up of the fatherless offspring
of his whores, ran Acuna.

870
01:22:47,176 --> 01:22:50,168
He ran the Acuna Boys.

871
01:22:51,447 --> 01:22:56,384
Now, at the age of 80, it would be
this retired gentleman of leisure

872
01:22:56,452 --> 01:22:59,478
who could point me in Bill's direction.

873
01:23:01,423 --> 01:23:03,789
Señor Esteban Vihaio?

874
01:23:05,327 --> 01:23:06,692
Yes.

875
01:23:06,762 --> 01:23:08,730
May I join you?

876
01:23:10,800 --> 01:23:13,997
Only on the condition
that you call me Esteban.

877
01:23:14,069 --> 01:23:18,233
- May I join you, Esteban?
- Please.

878
01:23:22,444 --> 01:23:24,469
Americana?

879
01:23:24,580 --> 01:23:26,241
Yes.

880
01:23:26,348 --> 01:23:28,976
I speak a little Spanish, if you prefer.

881
01:23:29,084 --> 01:23:32,645
No, no, no, no.
I prefer English.

882
01:23:32,721 --> 01:23:35,246
I haven't spoken it in a while,

883
01:23:35,324 --> 01:23:38,691
but I would relish
the opportunity to converse

884
01:23:38,761 --> 01:23:41,628
with such a pretty
companion as yourself.

885
01:23:41,697 --> 01:23:46,100
It's my pleasure to be in the company
of such a fine gentleman as yourself.

886
01:23:46,168 --> 01:23:49,103
I must warn you, young lady...

887
01:23:49,171 --> 01:23:52,140
...I am susceptible to flattery.

888
01:23:55,277 --> 01:23:57,245
How may I be of service to you?

889
01:24:05,621 --> 01:24:07,316
Where's Bill?

890
01:24:09,692 --> 01:24:12,320
Ahh.

891
01:24:12,394 --> 01:24:14,419
You must be Beatrix.

892
01:24:16,498 --> 01:24:18,659
I can see the attraction.

893
01:24:21,337 --> 01:24:26,673
I remember when Bill was only
five years old, I took him to the movies.

894
01:24:26,742 --> 01:24:30,439
It was a movie starring Lana Turner.

895
01:24:30,546 --> 01:24:35,574
The Postman Always Ring Twice,
with John Garfields.

896
01:24:35,684 --> 01:24:38,949
And whenever she would
appear on the screen,

897
01:24:39,021 --> 01:24:44,653
Bill would begin compulsively to
suck his thumb to an obscene amount.

898
01:24:44,727 --> 01:24:50,290
And I knew from this very moment,
this boy was a fool for blonds.

899
01:24:55,804 --> 01:24:57,897
Mmm.

900
01:24:57,973 --> 01:24:59,634
You know...

901
01:24:59,708 --> 01:25:03,508
...being a fool for a woman
such as yourself...

902
01:25:03,612 --> 01:25:07,013
...is always the right thing to do.

903
01:25:09,018 --> 01:25:14,012
If we had met when I was
back in business...

904
01:25:14,089 --> 01:25:18,651
...you would have been
my number one lady.

905
01:25:21,063 --> 01:25:24,726
- Well, I'm flattered.
- You goddamn well better be.

906
01:25:27,102 --> 01:25:31,630
This... I heard you were driving a truck.

907
01:25:31,707 --> 01:25:33,641
My Pussy Wagon died on me.

908
01:25:34,576 --> 01:25:37,670
The Pussy died. Hmm.

909
01:25:40,516 --> 01:25:43,314
Bill shot you in the head, no?

910
01:25:43,385 --> 01:25:45,979
- Yes.
- Hmm.

911
01:25:47,256 --> 01:25:50,350
I would have been much nicer.

912
01:25:50,426 --> 01:25:52,724
I would have just cut your face.

913
01:25:55,798 --> 01:25:57,425
You must forgive me.

914
01:25:57,499 --> 01:25:59,933
Please... you have a drink with me.

915
01:26:03,339 --> 01:26:07,537
Clara! (smooches)

916
01:26:09,111 --> 01:26:10,806
Coming.

917
01:26:13,582 --> 01:26:15,413
Dos añejo.

918
01:26:17,553 --> 01:26:18,679
(mumbles)

919
01:26:27,930 --> 01:26:29,420
Gracias.

920
01:26:34,737 --> 01:26:37,763
What were we talking about?

921
01:26:44,146 --> 01:26:46,114
Bill.

922
01:26:47,883 --> 01:26:51,842
- Where's Bill?
- Where's Bill.

923
01:26:51,954 --> 01:26:54,445
Yeah. Hmm.

924
01:26:54,523 --> 01:26:59,984
Bill is at the Villa Quatro,
on the road to Salina.

925
01:27:00,062 --> 01:27:02,360
I will draw you a map.

926
01:27:03,899 --> 01:27:06,231
Bill is like a son to me.

927
01:27:07,870 --> 01:27:11,863
- Do you know why I help you?
- No.

928
01:27:11,940 --> 01:27:13,874
Because he would want me to.

929
01:27:15,344 --> 01:27:17,812
Now, that I don't believe.

930
01:27:17,880 --> 01:27:20,314
Ahh.

931
01:27:20,382 --> 01:27:24,876
How else is he ever
going to see you again?

932
01:28:32,888 --> 01:28:34,515
Freeze, Mommy.

933
01:28:34,590 --> 01:28:36,581
Bang, bang! Oh!

934
01:28:36,658 --> 01:28:38,888
Oh! She got us, B.B.

935
01:28:38,961 --> 01:28:41,896
Mommy got us.
Oh, I'm dying!

936
01:28:41,964 --> 01:28:45,229
(groaning) I'm dying.

937
01:28:46,702 --> 01:28:50,160
Fall down, sweetheart.
Mommy shot us.

938
01:28:51,707 --> 01:28:58,237
But little did Quickdraw Kiddo know
that little B.B. was only playing possum,

939
01:28:58,347 --> 01:29:03,341
due to the fact that
she was impervious to bullets.

940
01:29:03,452 --> 01:29:05,477
I am pervious to bullets, Mommy.

941
01:29:05,587 --> 01:29:09,216
Hey, get back down there.
You're playing possum.

942
01:29:09,358 --> 01:29:14,990
So, as the smirking killer
advanced on what she thought

943
01:29:15,063 --> 01:29:20,501
was a bullet-ridden corpse,
that's when little B.B. fired.

944
01:29:22,771 --> 01:29:23,760
Bang, bang!

945
01:29:31,680 --> 01:29:35,912
You're dead, Mommy.
So die.

946
01:29:36,952 --> 01:29:38,476
Oh!

947
01:29:41,590 --> 01:29:42,614
B.B.

948
01:29:46,595 --> 01:29:50,429
Oh! B. B...

949
01:29:50,499 --> 01:29:52,763
(grunts)

950
01:29:52,834 --> 01:29:55,962
I should've known.

951
01:29:56,038 --> 01:29:59,337
You are... the best.

952
01:30:06,348 --> 01:30:08,908
Oh, Mommy.
Don't die.

953
01:30:09,418 --> 01:30:11,579
I was just playing.

954
01:30:16,825 --> 01:30:18,349
I know.

955
01:30:32,507 --> 01:30:35,476
I told her that you were asleep...

956
01:30:35,577 --> 01:30:40,446
...but that one day you'd wake up
and come back to her.

957
01:30:40,515 --> 01:30:44,747
And she asked me, "If Mommy's
been asleep since I was born,

958
01:30:44,820 --> 01:30:47,516
then how will she know what I look like?"

959
01:30:47,589 --> 01:30:54,256
To which I replied, "Because
Mommy's been dreaming of you."

960
01:30:55,230 --> 01:30:58,131
That's what I said.

961
01:30:58,200 --> 01:31:01,465
Did you dream of me?
I dreamed of you.

962
01:31:02,537 --> 01:31:06,234
Every single night, baby.
Every single night.

963
01:31:06,308 --> 01:31:09,368
I waited a long time
for you to wake up, Mommy.

964
01:31:21,556 --> 01:31:23,547
Now, let me look at you.

965
01:31:25,360 --> 01:31:26,588
Oh.

966
01:31:30,766 --> 01:31:34,634
My, my, my,
what a pretty little girl you are.

967
01:31:34,703 --> 01:31:36,432
You're pretty too, Mommy.

968
01:31:42,844 --> 01:31:46,371
Tell Mommy what you said
when I showed you her picture.

969
01:31:46,481 --> 01:31:47,539
Mnh-mnh.

970
01:31:47,649 --> 01:31:50,311
- Come on, shy girl.
- Mnh-mnh.

971
01:31:50,385 --> 01:31:53,047
Come on. You know what you said.

972
01:31:53,121 --> 01:31:57,387
Come on. Tell Mommy.
It'll make her feel good. Come on.

973
01:31:57,459 --> 01:31:59,893
- Mnh-mnh.
- Yeah. Come on.

974
01:31:59,961 --> 01:32:02,452
I said... I said,

975
01:32:02,531 --> 01:32:08,731
"You're the most beautifulest woman
I ever saw in the whole wide world."

976
01:32:10,372 --> 01:32:14,138
That's the truth.
That's what she said.

977
01:32:14,843 --> 01:32:20,941
B.B., don't you think Mommy has the
prettiest hair in the whole wide world?

978
01:32:21,049 --> 01:32:24,849
- Yes, I do.
- Matter of fact, it's better than pretty.

979
01:32:26,321 --> 01:32:31,054
- What's better than pretty?
- Mmm... Gorgeous.

980
01:32:31,126 --> 01:32:35,927
Very good. Gorgeous.
Mommy is gorgeous.

981
01:32:38,800 --> 01:32:43,828
Hmm. You know, sweetie,
Mommy's kinda mad at Daddy.

982
01:32:43,905 --> 01:32:46,806
Why, Daddy?
Were you being a bad daddy?

983
01:32:46,875 --> 01:32:51,312
I'm afraid I was.
I was a real bad daddy.

984
01:32:52,881 --> 01:32:56,840
Our little girl learned about
life and death the other day.

985
01:32:56,952 --> 01:33:01,787
Wanna tell Mommy about
what happened to Emilio?

986
01:33:03,492 --> 01:33:06,427
I killed him.

987
01:33:06,495 --> 01:33:11,592
- Emilio was her goldfish.
- Emilio was my goldfiss.

988
01:33:11,666 --> 01:33:16,330
She came running into my room,
holding the fish in her hand and crying,

989
01:33:16,405 --> 01:33:19,374
"Daddy. Daddy.
Emilio's dead."

990
01:33:21,076 --> 01:33:25,137
And I said, "Really? That's so sad.

991
01:33:25,247 --> 01:33:27,408
How did he die?"

992
01:33:27,516 --> 01:33:30,576
- And what did you say?
- I stepped on him.

993
01:33:30,685 --> 01:33:35,918
Actually, young lady, the words
you so strategically used were,

994
01:33:35,991 --> 01:33:39,893
"I accidentally stepped on him."

995
01:33:39,961 --> 01:33:41,895
To which I queried,

996
01:33:41,963 --> 01:33:47,458
"And just how did your foot accidentally
find its way into Emilio's fishbowl?"

997
01:33:47,536 --> 01:33:51,802
And she said, "No, no, no. Emilio was
on the carpet when I stepped on him."

998
01:33:51,873 --> 01:33:55,809
Mmm. The plot thickens.

999
01:33:55,877 --> 01:34:00,746
"And just how did Emilio
get on the carpet?"

1000
01:34:00,816 --> 01:34:04,183
And Mommy, you would've been
so proud of her.

1001
01:34:06,621 --> 01:34:08,646
She didn't lie.

1002
01:34:08,723 --> 01:34:12,887
She said she took Emilio
out of his bowl...

1003
01:34:12,961 --> 01:34:16,488
...and put him on the carpet.

1004
01:34:18,033 --> 01:34:22,094
And what was Emilio
doing on the carpet?

1005
01:34:22,170 --> 01:34:24,001
Flapping.

1006
01:34:25,106 --> 01:34:28,906
- And then you stomped on him.
- Uh-huh.

1007
01:34:28,977 --> 01:34:32,777
And when you lifted up your foot...

1008
01:34:32,881 --> 01:34:36,908
...what was Emilio doing then?
- Nothing.

1009
01:34:37,018 --> 01:34:39,782
He stopped flapping, didn't he?

1010
01:34:42,290 --> 01:34:44,758
She told me later...

1011
01:34:44,826 --> 01:34:47,124
...that the second she lifted up her foot

1012
01:34:47,195 --> 01:34:51,427
and saw Emilio not flapping,
she knew what she had done.

1013
01:34:51,500 --> 01:34:56,597
Is that not the perfect
visual image of life and death?

1014
01:34:56,671 --> 01:35:01,768
A fish flapping on the carpet,
and a fish not flapping on the carpet.

1015
01:35:03,945 --> 01:35:09,975
So powerful, even a four-year-old
with no concept of life or death...

1016
01:35:10,085 --> 01:35:12,713
...knew what it meant.

1017
01:35:13,421 --> 01:35:16,515
- You loved Emilio, didn't you?
- Uh-huh.

1018
01:35:16,591 --> 01:35:19,526
Well... I love Mommy, too.

1019
01:35:20,996 --> 01:35:23,226
But I did to Mommy
what you did to Emilio.

1020
01:35:23,298 --> 01:35:27,257
- You stomped on Mommy?
- Worse.

1021
01:35:27,335 --> 01:35:29,428
I shot Mommy.

1022
01:35:29,504 --> 01:35:32,667
Not pretend shooting
like we were just doing.

1023
01:35:32,741 --> 01:35:34,402
I shot her for real.

1024
01:35:34,476 --> 01:35:36,944
Why? Did you want to see
what would happen?

1025
01:35:37,045 --> 01:35:41,778
No, I knew what would happen
to Mommy if I shot her.

1026
01:35:41,850 --> 01:35:46,344
What I didn't know was, when I shot
Mommy, what would happen to me.

1027
01:35:46,421 --> 01:35:50,084
- What happened?
- I was very sad.

1028
01:35:52,427 --> 01:35:54,657
And that's when I learned...

1029
01:35:54,729 --> 01:35:59,792
...some things, once you do,
they can never be undone.

1030
01:36:02,971 --> 01:36:08,102
- What happened to Mommy?
- Why don't you ask Mommy?

1031
01:36:08,176 --> 01:36:11,339
You OK, Mommy?
Did it hurt?

1032
01:36:11,446 --> 01:36:15,109
No, sweetie.

1033
01:36:15,216 --> 01:36:17,616
Doesn't hurt anymore.

1034
01:36:23,258 --> 01:36:25,249
Did it make you sick?

1035
01:36:26,595 --> 01:36:30,929
No. It made me sleep.

1036
01:36:30,999 --> 01:36:33,695
That's why I haven't been with you, B.B.
I've been asleep.

1037
01:36:33,768 --> 01:36:37,499
But you're awake now, Mommy. Right?

1038
01:36:37,572 --> 01:36:40,700
I'm wide awake, pretty girl.

1039
01:36:40,775 --> 01:36:46,042
B.B., would you like Mommy to watch
a video with you before sleepy time?

1040
01:36:46,147 --> 01:36:47,614
Uh-huh.

1041
01:36:47,682 --> 01:36:51,448
Mommy, do you wanna watch
a video with me before sleepy time?

1042
01:36:51,519 --> 01:36:54,215
Oh, yeah!
I would love to.

1043
01:36:54,289 --> 01:36:57,087
- Which one do you wanna watch?
- Shogun Assassin.

1044
01:36:57,158 --> 01:36:59,524
No, B.B.
Shogun Assassin is too long.

1045
01:36:59,594 --> 01:37:03,587
- Mnh-mnh.
- No, it's not.

1046
01:37:03,665 --> 01:37:07,931
Well, then, I'll leave you ladies to it.

1047
01:37:14,843 --> 01:37:20,247
(boy) When I was little,
my father was famous.

1048
01:37:20,315 --> 01:37:24,649
He was the greatest samurai
in the empire.

1049
01:37:24,719 --> 01:37:28,018
And he was the shogun's decapitator.

1050
01:37:28,089 --> 01:37:33,356
He cut off the heads of 131 lords.

1051
01:37:33,428 --> 01:37:37,888
My father would come home to Mother
and when he would see her,

1052
01:37:37,966 --> 01:37:40,662
he would forget about the killings.

1053
01:37:40,735 --> 01:37:45,900
He wasn't scared of the shogun,
but the shogun was scared of him.

1054
01:37:45,974 --> 01:37:48,670
Maybe that was the problem.

1055
01:37:48,743 --> 01:37:51,576
One night, the shogun sent...

1056
01:37:51,713 --> 01:37:56,241
(# "About Her"by Malcolm McLaren)

1057
01:38:04,392 --> 01:38:09,728
# My man got a heart

1058
01:38:09,798 --> 01:38:16,863
# Like the rock that's in the sea

1059
01:38:22,811 --> 01:38:29,649
# Well, no one told me about her

1060
01:38:29,718 --> 01:38:32,687
# The way she lied

1061
01:38:35,223 --> 01:38:41,787
# Well, no one told me about her

1062
01:38:41,863 --> 01:38:45,162
# How many people cried

1063
01:38:54,008 --> 01:38:59,674
# My man got a heart

1064
01:38:59,781 --> 01:39:06,687
# Like the rock that's in the sea

1065
01:39:06,755 --> 01:39:12,125
# My man got a heart

1066
01:39:12,193 --> 01:39:19,725
# Like the rock that's in the sea

1067
01:39:25,173 --> 01:39:32,011
# Well, no one told me about her

1068
01:39:32,113 --> 01:39:35,276
# The way she lied

1069
01:39:37,585 --> 01:39:44,149
# Well, no one told me about her

1070
01:39:44,225 --> 01:39:47,786
# How many people cried

1071
01:39:48,630 --> 01:39:54,762
# But it's too late to say you're sorry

1072
01:39:54,836 --> 01:39:57,396
# How would I know?

1073
01:39:57,472 --> 01:40:01,272
# Why should I care?

1074
01:40:01,342 --> 01:40:07,008
# Please don't bother trying to find her

1075
01:40:07,115 --> 01:40:11,814
# She's not there

1076
01:40:13,354 --> 01:40:16,255
I was just admiring your sword.

1077
01:40:16,324 --> 01:40:19,851
Quite a piece of work.

1078
01:40:19,928 --> 01:40:24,160
Speaking of which, how is Hanzo-san?

1079
01:40:24,699 --> 01:40:26,166
He's good.

1080
01:40:28,236 --> 01:40:31,205
Has his sushi gotten any better?

1081
01:40:34,342 --> 01:40:39,143
You know, I couldn't believe it.
You got him to make you a sword.

1082
01:40:39,247 --> 01:40:43,513
It was easy.
I just dropped your name, Bill.

1083
01:40:43,585 --> 01:40:45,678
That'd do it.

1084
01:40:58,867 --> 01:41:04,897
# Well, no one told me about her

1085
01:41:11,212 --> 01:41:15,842
# Well, no one told me about her

1086
01:41:16,918 --> 01:41:22,185
I suppose the idea is we cross
Hanzo swords. Am I right?

1087
01:41:24,192 --> 01:41:25,819
Well,

1088
01:41:25,894 --> 01:41:31,127
it just so happens this hacienda
has its own private beach.

1089
01:41:31,199 --> 01:41:35,397
And that private beach just so happens
to look particularly beautiful

1090
01:41:35,470 --> 01:41:38,462
bathed in moonlight.

1091
01:41:38,539 --> 01:41:41,337
And there just so happens to be
a full moon out tonight.

1092
01:41:41,409 --> 01:41:48,178
So, swordfighter, if you want
a swordfight, that's where I suggest.

1093
01:41:48,850 --> 01:41:52,479
But if you wanna be old school about it...

1094
01:41:52,553 --> 01:41:56,182
...and you know
I'm all about old school...

1095
01:41:56,257 --> 01:41:59,954
...then we could wait until dawn
and slice each other up at sunrise

1096
01:42:00,028 --> 01:42:02,292
like a couple of real-life honest...

1097
01:42:04,565 --> 01:42:09,468
Now, if you don't settle down, I'm gonna
have to put one in your kneecap.

1098
01:42:09,537 --> 01:42:12,836
And I hear tell that's
a very painful place to get shot in.

1099
01:42:14,943 --> 01:42:18,674
(laughing) I'm just fuckin' with you.

1100
01:42:20,581 --> 01:42:22,674
Now...

1101
01:42:22,784 --> 01:42:25,309
...when it comes to you...

1102
01:42:25,420 --> 01:42:27,388
...and us...

1103
01:42:29,023 --> 01:42:32,186
...I have a few unanswered questions.

1104
01:42:32,260 --> 01:42:38,722
So, before this tale of bloody revenge
reaches its climax,

1105
01:42:38,800 --> 01:42:44,067
I'm gonna ask you some questions,
and I want you to tell me the truth.

1106
01:42:44,138 --> 01:42:48,370
However, therein lies a dilemma.

1107
01:42:48,443 --> 01:42:50,934
Because when it comes
to the subject of me,

1108
01:42:51,045 --> 01:42:56,415
I believe you are truly and utterly
incapable of telling the truth.

1109
01:42:56,484 --> 01:43:00,818
Especially to me.
And least of all, to yourself.

1110
01:43:00,888 --> 01:43:04,380
And when it comes to the subject of me,

1111
01:43:04,459 --> 01:43:11,262
I am truly and utterly incapable
of believing anything you say.

1112
01:43:11,332 --> 01:43:13,357
How do you suppose
we solve this dilemma?

1113
01:43:13,434 --> 01:43:15,197
Well,

1114
01:43:15,269 --> 01:43:17,260
it just so happens,

1115
01:43:17,338 --> 01:43:19,465
I have a solution.

1116
01:43:19,540 --> 01:43:21,974
- Aah!
- Gotcha!

1117
01:43:22,043 --> 01:43:24,204
(grunting) Goddamn!

1118
01:43:24,312 --> 01:43:26,678
(laughs)

1119
01:43:26,748 --> 01:43:30,149
What the fuck
did you just shoot me with?

1120
01:43:30,218 --> 01:43:33,949
My greatest invention.
Or at least my favorite.

1121
01:43:34,722 --> 01:43:37,589
Don't touch it, or I'll stick another one
right in your cheek.

1122
01:43:42,330 --> 01:43:48,599
What lies within that dart, just begging
to course its way through your veins...

1123
01:43:48,669 --> 01:43:53,197
...is an incredibly potent
and quite infallible truth serum.

1124
01:43:53,274 --> 01:43:56,402
I call it "The Undisputed Truth."

1125
01:43:56,477 --> 01:44:01,915
Twice as strong as sodium pentothal,
with no druggie aftereffects.

1126
01:44:02,016 --> 01:44:07,750
Except for a slight wave of euphoria.
You feel it?

1127
01:44:07,822 --> 01:44:10,814
- Euphoria?
- Yeah.

1128
01:44:10,892 --> 01:44:13,861
- No.
- Too bad.

1129
01:44:14,996 --> 01:44:17,294
As you know...

1130
01:44:17,365 --> 01:44:20,823
...l'm quite keen on comic books.

1131
01:44:21,636 --> 01:44:24,503
Especially the ones about superheroes.

1132
01:44:24,572 --> 01:44:30,135
I find the whole mythology
surrounding superheroes fascinating.

1133
01:44:30,244 --> 01:44:34,806
Take my favorite superhero, Superman.

1134
01:44:34,916 --> 01:44:37,942
Not a great comic book.
Not particularly well-drawn.

1135
01:44:39,620 --> 01:44:41,315
Mmm.

1136
01:44:41,389 --> 01:44:43,789
But the mythology...

1137
01:44:43,858 --> 01:44:47,225
The mythology is not only great,
it's unique.

1138
01:44:47,295 --> 01:44:51,561
How long does this shit take
to go into effect?

1139
01:44:51,632 --> 01:44:55,568
About two minutes. Just long enough
for me to finish my point.

1140
01:44:55,636 --> 01:45:00,767
Now, a staple of the superhero
mythology is,

1141
01:45:00,842 --> 01:45:03,868
there's the superhero
and there's the alter ego.

1142
01:45:03,978 --> 01:45:08,176
Batman is actually Bruce Wayne,
Spider-Man is actually Peter Parker.

1143
01:45:09,383 --> 01:45:13,217
When that character wakes up
in the morning, he's Peter Parker.

1144
01:45:13,287 --> 01:45:18,452
He has to put on a costume
to become Spider-Man.

1145
01:45:18,526 --> 01:45:24,362
And it is in that characteristic
Superman stands alone.

1146
01:45:24,432 --> 01:45:27,265
Superman didn't become Superman.

1147
01:45:27,335 --> 01:45:30,031
Superman was born Superman.

1148
01:45:30,104 --> 01:45:34,438
When Superman wakes up
in the morning, he's Superman.

1149
01:45:34,509 --> 01:45:37,034
His alter ego is Clark Kent.

1150
01:45:38,079 --> 01:45:41,207
His outfit with the big red "S" -

1151
01:45:41,315 --> 01:45:44,978
that's the blanket he was wrapped in
as a baby when the Kents found him.

1152
01:45:45,052 --> 01:45:47,919
Those are his clothes.

1153
01:45:47,989 --> 01:45:53,222
What Kent wears - the glasses,
the business suit - that's the costume.

1154
01:45:53,294 --> 01:45:59,460
That's the costume Superman wears
to blend in with us.

1155
01:45:59,534 --> 01:46:02,935
Clark Kent is how Superman views us.

1156
01:46:03,004 --> 01:46:06,269
And what are the characteristics
of Clark Kent?

1157
01:46:06,340 --> 01:46:08,672
He's weak...

1158
01:46:08,743 --> 01:46:11,610
...he's unsure of himself...

1159
01:46:11,712 --> 01:46:13,407
...he's a coward.

1160
01:46:14,482 --> 01:46:19,419
Clark Kent is Superman's critique
on the whole human race.

1161
01:46:21,189 --> 01:46:25,922
Sorta like Beatrix Kiddo
and Mrs. Tommy Plimpton.

1162
01:46:27,128 --> 01:46:29,358
Aso.

1163
01:46:29,430 --> 01:46:31,625
The point emerges.

1164
01:46:33,334 --> 01:46:36,861
You would've worn the costume
of Arlene Plimpton.

1165
01:46:36,938 --> 01:46:40,704
But you were born Beatrix Kiddo.

1166
01:46:40,775 --> 01:46:45,735
And every morning when you woke up,
you'd still be Beatrix Kiddo.

1167
01:46:45,846 --> 01:46:47,973
Oh, you can... take the needle out.

1168
01:46:55,356 --> 01:46:57,620
Are you calling me a superhero?

1169
01:46:57,692 --> 01:46:59,819
I'm calling you a killer.

1170
01:46:59,894 --> 01:47:02,795
A natural born killer.

1171
01:47:02,863 --> 01:47:06,492
You always have been,
and you always will be.

1172
01:47:06,567 --> 01:47:08,797
Moving to El Paso...

1173
01:47:08,869 --> 01:47:12,270
...working in a used record store...

1174
01:47:12,340 --> 01:47:14,865
...goin' to the movies with Tommy...

1175
01:47:14,942 --> 01:47:16,432
...clipping coupons.

1176
01:47:16,510 --> 01:47:18,341
That's you...

1177
01:47:18,446 --> 01:47:21,904
...trying to disguise yourself
as a worker bee.

1178
01:47:22,016 --> 01:47:25,008
That's you tryin' to blend in with the hive.

1179
01:47:25,119 --> 01:47:27,519
But you're not a worker bee.

1180
01:47:28,522 --> 01:47:31,355
You're a renegade killer bee.

1181
01:47:31,425 --> 01:47:34,223
And no matter how much beer you drank
or barbecue you ate

1182
01:47:34,295 --> 01:47:37,594
or how fat your ass got,

1183
01:47:37,665 --> 01:47:41,533
nothing in the world
would ever change that.

1184
01:47:43,971 --> 01:47:45,996
First question:

1185
01:47:48,209 --> 01:47:53,579
Did you really think your life in El Paso
was gonna work?

1186
01:47:59,320 --> 01:48:01,254
No!

1187
01:48:04,392 --> 01:48:07,418
But I would've had B.B.!

1188
01:48:07,495 --> 01:48:10,191
Don't get me wrong.

1189
01:48:10,264 --> 01:48:14,166
I think you would have been
a wonderful mother.

1190
01:48:14,235 --> 01:48:16,760
But you are a killer.

1191
01:48:20,908 --> 01:48:23,672
All those people you killed to get to me...

1192
01:48:23,778 --> 01:48:26,246
...felt damn good, didn't they?

1193
01:48:28,416 --> 01:48:30,884
Yes.

1194
01:48:30,951 --> 01:48:33,249
Every single one of them?

1195
01:48:43,531 --> 01:48:45,260
Yes.

1196
01:48:48,602 --> 01:48:51,196
That was the warmup round.

1197
01:48:51,272 --> 01:48:56,574
Now comes the $64,000 question.

1198
01:49:03,284 --> 01:49:06,879
Why did you run away
from me with my baby?

1199
01:49:10,725 --> 01:49:14,161
Do you remember the last assignment
you sent me on?

1200
01:49:14,228 --> 01:49:16,662
Of course.

1201
01:49:16,731 --> 01:49:18,756
Lisa Wong.

1202
01:49:20,101 --> 01:49:22,661
The morning I left, I was sick.

1203
01:49:24,338 --> 01:49:26,966
On the plane, I threw up.

1204
01:49:28,809 --> 01:49:32,711
So I started thinking:

1205
01:49:32,780 --> 01:49:34,907
Maybe I was pregnant.

1206
01:49:35,015 --> 01:49:39,452
"Easy to use. Remove cap and urinate
on the absorbent end for five seconds.

1207
01:49:41,655 --> 01:49:44,146
"Accurate results in only 90 seconds.

1208
01:49:44,225 --> 01:49:47,717
You can read the results as soon as
the line appears in the window."

1209
01:49:47,795 --> 01:49:48,887
(sighs)

1210
01:49:48,963 --> 01:49:51,193
(clock ticking)

1211
01:50:24,131 --> 01:50:25,155
Fuck.

1212
01:50:25,232 --> 01:50:27,393
(the bride) What I didn't know...

1213
01:50:27,468 --> 01:50:31,529
...was that somewhere on my journey
I had been spotted.

1214
01:50:31,605 --> 01:50:37,703
With me in L.A., it didn't take Lisa Wong
long to send an assassin of her own.

1215
01:50:37,812 --> 01:50:40,508
- (doorbell)
- (the bride) Hello, can I help you?

1216
01:50:40,614 --> 01:50:43,947
(woman) Hello, I'm Karen Kim.
I'm the hospitality manager of the hotel.

1217
01:50:44,018 --> 01:50:45,815
I have a welcome gift
from the management.

1218
01:50:45,886 --> 01:50:49,083
Oh, that's nice. Um...

1219
01:50:49,156 --> 01:50:51,147
Can you just leave it by the door?

1220
01:51:03,571 --> 01:51:06,768
- You pretty good with that shotgun?
- Not that I have to be at this range,

1221
01:51:06,841 --> 01:51:08,741
but I'm a fuckin' surgeon
with this shotgun.

1222
01:51:08,809 --> 01:51:11,869
Well, guess what, bitch?
I'm better than Annie Oakley.

1223
01:51:11,979 --> 01:51:15,380
- And I got you right in my sight.
- I could blow your fuckin' head off.

1224
01:51:15,449 --> 01:51:19,613
Not before I put one
right between your eyes, so let's talk.

1225
01:51:21,288 --> 01:51:23,449
Karen...

1226
01:51:25,392 --> 01:51:27,724
...I just found out...

1227
01:51:27,795 --> 01:51:29,763
...right now...

1228
01:51:29,830 --> 01:51:35,791
...not a moment before
you blew a hole through the door...

1229
01:51:35,870 --> 01:51:38,737
...that I'm pregnant.
- What is this?

1230
01:51:40,241 --> 01:51:43,074
On the floor by the door...

1231
01:51:43,143 --> 01:51:46,271
...is a strip that says I'm pregnant.

1232
01:51:46,380 --> 01:51:47,506
Bullshit.

1233
01:51:48,816 --> 01:51:52,479
Any other time
you'd be 100 percent right.

1234
01:51:52,553 --> 01:51:55,420
This time...

1235
01:51:55,489 --> 01:51:57,514
...you're 100 percent wrong.

1236
01:51:59,994 --> 01:52:03,589
I'm the deadliest woman in the world.

1237
01:52:03,664 --> 01:52:05,859
But right now...

1238
01:52:05,933 --> 01:52:08,299
...l'm just scared shitless for my baby.

1239
01:52:09,169 --> 01:52:11,160
Please.

1240
01:52:12,273 --> 01:52:14,673
Just look at the strip.

1241
01:52:16,744 --> 01:52:18,473
Please.

1242
01:52:19,813 --> 01:52:24,546
Stay where you are and don't move.

1243
01:52:41,735 --> 01:52:44,101
I don't know what this fuckin' shit means.

1244
01:52:44,171 --> 01:52:46,571
The box with the directions -
it's right there.

1245
01:52:58,352 --> 01:52:59,979
"Easy to use.

1246
01:53:00,054 --> 01:53:04,616
Remove the cap and urinate
on the absorbent end."

1247
01:53:04,692 --> 01:53:06,353
Blue means pregnant.

1248
01:53:07,161 --> 01:53:09,152
I'll read it myself, thank you.

1249
01:53:16,036 --> 01:53:18,971
Oh, OK.

1250
01:53:19,039 --> 01:53:21,269
Say I were to believe you.
What then?

1251
01:53:21,342 --> 01:53:23,970
Just go home.

1252
01:53:25,112 --> 01:53:27,171
I'll do the same.

1253
01:53:32,286 --> 01:53:34,254
(door opens)

1254
01:53:46,800 --> 01:53:48,392
Congratulations.

1255
01:53:52,072 --> 01:53:54,870
(the bride) Before that strip turned blue...

1256
01:53:54,942 --> 01:53:58,400
...I was a woman, I was your woman.

1257
01:53:58,479 --> 01:54:01,937
I was a killer who killed for you.

1258
01:54:02,049 --> 01:54:05,109
Before that strip turned blue,
I would've jumped a motorcycle

1259
01:54:05,219 --> 01:54:08,211
onto a speeding train.

1260
01:54:08,288 --> 01:54:10,279
For you.

1261
01:54:11,592 --> 01:54:14,959
But once that strip turned blue...

1262
01:54:15,029 --> 01:54:18,521
...I could no longer do
any of those things.

1263
01:54:18,599 --> 01:54:21,067
Not anymore.

1264
01:54:21,135 --> 01:54:23,695
Because I was gonna be a mother.

1265
01:54:26,807 --> 01:54:28,570
Can you understand that?

1266
01:54:31,812 --> 01:54:34,372
Yes.

1267
01:54:34,481 --> 01:54:36,608
But why didn't you...

1268
01:54:36,717 --> 01:54:39,880
...tell me then, instead of now?

1269
01:54:39,953 --> 01:54:42,251
Once you knew, you'd claim her.

1270
01:54:42,322 --> 01:54:44,313
And I didn't want that.

1271
01:54:45,059 --> 01:54:47,289
Not your decision to make.

1272
01:54:47,361 --> 01:54:49,488
Yes.

1273
01:54:49,563 --> 01:54:53,829
But it's the right decision,
and I made it for my daughter.

1274
01:54:53,901 --> 01:54:58,565
She deserved to be born
with a clean slate.

1275
01:54:58,639 --> 01:55:00,573
But with you...

1276
01:55:00,641 --> 01:55:04,771
...she would've been born
into a world she shouldn't have.

1277
01:55:06,313 --> 01:55:09,476
I had to choose.

1278
01:55:09,583 --> 01:55:11,551
I chose her.

1279
01:55:14,154 --> 01:55:16,952
You know, five years ago,

1280
01:55:17,024 --> 01:55:21,893
if I had to make a list of impossible
things that could never happen,

1281
01:55:21,962 --> 01:55:27,594
you performing a coup de grâce on me
by bustin' a cap in my crown...

1282
01:55:30,003 --> 01:55:32,665
...would've been right
at the top of the list.

1283
01:55:34,341 --> 01:55:36,366
I'd have been wrong, wouldn't I?

1284
01:55:37,711 --> 01:55:39,645
I-I'm sorry.

1285
01:55:39,713 --> 01:55:41,806
Was that a question?

1286
01:55:43,083 --> 01:55:45,711
Of impossible things
that could never happen -

1287
01:55:45,786 --> 01:55:49,017
yes, in this instance,
you would've been wrong.

1288
01:55:49,923 --> 01:55:50,981
Well?

1289
01:55:51,992 --> 01:55:54,688
When you never came back,

1290
01:55:54,762 --> 01:56:00,860
I naturally assumed Lisa Wong,
or somebody else, had killed you.

1291
01:56:00,934 --> 01:56:04,165
Oh! And for the record...

1292
01:56:04,238 --> 01:56:08,436
...letting somebody think somebody
they love is dead when they're not

1293
01:56:08,509 --> 01:56:10,500
is quite cruel.

1294
01:56:13,947 --> 01:56:17,815
I mourned you for three months.

1295
01:56:18,619 --> 01:56:22,988
And in the third month of mourning you...

1296
01:56:23,056 --> 01:56:25,422
...I tracked you down.

1297
01:56:25,492 --> 01:56:27,619
I wasn't tryin' to track you down.

1298
01:56:27,694 --> 01:56:33,132
I was tryin' to track down
the fucking assholes I thought killed you.

1299
01:56:33,200 --> 01:56:36,692
So I find you...

1300
01:56:36,770 --> 01:56:38,965
...and what do I find?

1301
01:56:39,039 --> 01:56:42,372
Not only are you not dead...

1302
01:56:42,442 --> 01:56:46,503
...you're getting married
to some fucking jerk.

1303
01:56:48,849 --> 01:56:51,340
And you're pregnant.

1304
01:56:54,688 --> 01:56:57,054
I overreacted.

1305
01:57:05,632 --> 01:57:09,432
You overreacted?
Is that your explanation?

1306
01:57:09,503 --> 01:57:11,937
I didn't say I was gonna explain myself.

1307
01:57:12,005 --> 01:57:14,439
I said I was gonna tell you the truth.

1308
01:57:15,008 --> 01:57:18,967
But if that's too cryptic, let's get literal.

1309
01:57:21,448 --> 01:57:23,916
I'm a killer.

1310
01:57:24,017 --> 01:57:26,918
I'm a murdering bastard.
You know that.

1311
01:57:27,521 --> 01:57:30,490
And there are consequences...

1312
01:57:30,557 --> 01:57:34,823
...to breaking the heart
of a murdering bastard.

1313
01:57:34,895 --> 01:57:37,455
You experienced some of them.

1314
01:57:40,968 --> 01:57:44,563
Was my reaction really that surprising?

1315
01:57:44,638 --> 01:57:48,335
Yes. It was.

1316
01:57:50,744 --> 01:57:54,510
Could you do what you did?

1317
01:57:54,615 --> 01:57:58,346
Of course you could.

1318
01:57:58,418 --> 01:58:04,789
But I never thought you would,
or could, do that to me.

1319
01:58:04,858 --> 01:58:07,884
I'm really sorry, Kiddo...

1320
01:58:07,961 --> 01:58:10,122
...but you thought wrong.

1321
01:58:16,370 --> 01:58:20,500
You and I have unfinished business.

1322
01:58:21,375 --> 01:58:24,674
Baby... you ain't kiddin'.

1326
01:59:06,320 --> 01:59:08,481
'Course he did.

1327
01:59:10,357 --> 01:59:12,382
Why didn't you tell me?

1328
01:59:16,263 --> 01:59:18,322
I don't know.

1329
01:59:20,734 --> 01:59:23,669
Because I'm...

1330
01:59:23,737 --> 01:59:26,831
...a bad person.

1331
01:59:26,907 --> 01:59:29,000
No.

1332
01:59:30,444 --> 01:59:33,504
You're not a bad person.

1333
01:59:33,613 --> 01:59:36,582
You're a terrific person.

1334
01:59:36,683 --> 01:59:39,151
You're my favorite person.

1335
01:59:41,088 --> 01:59:44,990
But every once in a while...

1336
01:59:45,058 --> 01:59:47,049
...you can be a real cunt.

1337
02:00:06,580 --> 02:00:08,548

1338
02:00:24,297 --> 02:00:27,630

1339
02:02:13,306 --> 02:02:17,538
Well, well, well.

America and all the ships at sea.

Let's go to press. Flash.

Do you have a magpie in your home?

1343
02:02:30,957 --> 02:02:33,323
If you do, you are most fortunate.

1344
02:02:33,393 --> 02:02:37,056
The magpie is the most
charming bird in all the world.

1345
02:02:37,130 --> 02:02:39,598
He is the best friend a farmer ever had.

1346
02:02:39,666 --> 02:02:42,726
Treat him gently.
Treat him kindly.

1347
02:02:42,802 --> 02:02:47,262
And always remember,
the magpie deserves your respect.

1349
