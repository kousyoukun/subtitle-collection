00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,900
我可不会在孩子面前宰了你
I'm not going to murder you in front of your child, okay?

96
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:43,500
你比比尔更理性一点 我想你也不会那样做
That's being more irational than Bill led me to believe you were capable of.

97
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:47,500
我缺的是慈悲 同情 和宽恕...
It's mercy, compassion and forgiveness lack...

98
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:49,800
...而不是理性

99
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:55,900
听着...
Look...

100

101
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:02,100
害得你很惨 我希望我没做 但是我做了
I fucked you over bad. I wish to God I hadn't, but I did.

102
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,200
你有权利来讨回公道
You have every right to want to get even.

103
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,300
不...不是...
No no, no, no, no.

104
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,100
讨回公道？啥叫公道？
No. To get even, even-steven...

105
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,300
我得宰了你...
I would have to kill you...

106
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,500
...再去宰了你女儿...
...go up to Nikkis room kill her...

107
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:23,000
然后等你丈夫 好心的贝尔医生回家 再宰了他...
...then wait for your husband, the good Dr. Bell, to come home and kill him.

108
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:28,600
这才叫公道 我们才会谁也不欠谁
That would be even Vernita That'd be about square.

109
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:33,500
听着 如果时光能倒流我一定不会做 但是这不可能
Look, if I could go back in a machine, I would. But I can't.

110
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:38,000
我现在只能说我已经重新做人了
All can tell you is that I'm a different person now.

111
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:42,000
哦 好极了 可我不在乎
Oh great. I don't care.

112
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:47,000
尽管如此 我知道我不配你的施舍与宽恕
Be that as it may, I know I don't deserve your mercy or your forgiveness.

113
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:51,300
但是为了过去的事和我女儿 我求你宽恕
However, I beseech you for both on behalf of my daughter.

114
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,900
婊子 别说了
Bitch, you can stop right there.

115
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:59,600
虽然我不想在你女儿面前宰了你...
Just because I have no wish to murder you in front of your daughter...

116
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:04,100
并不表示你拿她来做幌子 我就会同情你
...doesn't mean that parading her around in front of me will inspire sympathy.

117
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:08,500
咱们来有一桩买卖未了
You and I have unfinished business.

118
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:12,300
就算你这四年来 做尽了善事...
And not a goddamned thing you've done in the subsequent four years...

119
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:16,500
...无论如何都不能使我改变心意
. including getting knocked up is going to change that.

120
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:19,700
那咱们什么何时了结？
So when do we do this?

121
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:24,600
这个嘛 就看你想什么时候死？
It all depends. When do you want to die?

122
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:27,800
明天？后天？
Tomorrow? The day after tomorrow?

123
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,600
- 今晚如何 婊子？- 好极了！ 哪里？
- How about tonight, bitch?
- Splendid. Where?

124
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:35,700
离这儿一哩左右 有个我教孩子打棒球的球场
There's a baseball diamond where I coach Litte League about a mile from here.

125
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,800
我们半夜两点半见 全身穿黑色衣服...
We meet there around 2:30 in the morning dressed all in black.

头发绑黑丝袜
Your hair in a black stocking.

127
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:46,800
我们就比剑 然后就一了百了
And we have us a knife fight. We won't be bothered.

128
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:48,300

...I have to fix Nikkis cerieal.

130
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:04,400
比尔总是说你是他见过最会用刀的女人之一
Bill always said you were one of the best ladies with an edged weapon.

131
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:09,200
去他妈的咧 他自己的剑术也不怎样
Fuck you bitch. I know he didn't qualify that shit.

132
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:12,900
你就准备去见阎王吧 黑曼巴
So you can just kiss my motherfucking ass, Black Mamba.

133
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,400
黑曼巴...

134
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:18,600
我才配叫做黑曼巴
I should have been mother fucking Black Mamba.

135
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,600
至于用什么刀？你就用以前的那种屠刀也行
Weapon of choice? If you want to stick with your butcher knife, that's fine by me.

136
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:25,600
真好笑 婊子
Very funny, bitch.

137
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:27,800
真好笑！
Very funny.

138
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:29,300
我不是故意要在你面前下手
It was not my intention to do this in front of you.

139
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:33,400
所以我很抱歉
For that, lm sorry.

140
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,300
不过你可以相信我...

我要杀一只黄鼠狼

419

那么就给我一把吧
Then give me one of these.

431
00:54:06,300 --> 00:54:08,600
这些是非卖品
These are not for sale.

432
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:14,100
我没说"卖" 我是说"给"
I didn't say "sell me" I said "give me".

433
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:19,500
为什么...我要帮助你？
Why should I help you?

434
00:54:19,900 --> 00:54:24,500
因为我的那只黄鼠狼 是你以前的徒弟
Because my vermin is a former student of yours.

435
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:29,600
就因为他是你学生

你要付出的代价是...
The price you pay

528
01:04:06,300 --> 01:04:13,220
对于我的中美血统有任何负面的评价 我就会取你的首级
for bringing up either my Chinese or American heritage
as a negative is, I collect your fucking head.

01:04:13,300 --> 01:04:15,700
就像这个混蛋一样

Now, if any of you sons of bitches
got anything else to say, now is the fucking time!

531
01:04:27,580 --> 01:04:29,140
我想也是
Didn't think so.

532
01:04:32,500 --> 01:04:35,340
各位 现在散会

any selfish demands they make.

他们的要求真的很荒谬
They demand ridiculous things.

537
01:11:54,980 --> 01:11:57,260
闭嘴！ 你知道如果他们听到了 你会怎么样吗？
Shut up... Do you know what would
happen if they heard you?

538
01:11:57,340 --> 01:11:58,180
会发生什么？
What's gonna happen?

你没听说田中帮吗？
Did you hear about the Tanaka clan?

540
01:11:59,860 --> 01:12:01,620
你的头会被砍掉
You're gonna get your head chopped off.

541
01:12:01,680 --> 01:12:03,410
我可不希望那样

542
01:12:50,740 --> 01:12:51,860
对，是我
Yes, it's me.

543

Charlie Brown.

548
01:13:24,300 --> 01:13:25,260
查理布朗
Charlie Brown.

549
01:13:25,540 --> 01:13:27,060
4个香肠匹萨
Four pepperoni pizzas.

550
01:13:27,380 --> 01:13:28,620
我们菜单上没有...
That's not on our menu...

551
01:13:28,820 --> 01:13:31,020
我不管 去拿来 妈的！
I don't care, bring them, goddammit!

552
01:13:32,300 --> 01:13:34,900
喂...喂...查理，给我一个吻
Hey... hey... Charlie, give me a kiss.

553
01:13:36,580 --> 01:13:38,380
石井尾莲！
O-Ren Ishii!

554
01:13:39,620 --> 01:13:43,140
你和我还有些恩怨未了！
You and I have unfinished business!

555
01:15:12,080 --> 01:15:14,640
查理不朗 滚
Charlie Brown, beat it.

556
01:15:22,380 --> 01:15:23,060
米奇
Miki.

557
01:15:41,840 --> 01:15:43,240
把这婊子给剁了！
TEAR THE BITCH APART!

558
01:17:13,960 --> 01:17:19,480
我说 尾莲 你还有属下来送死吗？
So, O-Ren, anymore subordinates
for me to kill?

559
01:17:21,040 --> 01:17:22,440
嗨
Hi!

560
01:17:24,080 --> 01:17:25,040
勾勾 对吧？
Gogo, right?

561
01:17:26,840 --> 01:17:28,520
答对啦
Bingo.

562
01:17:28,600 --> 01:17:30,440
你是黑曼巴？
And you're Black Mamba.

563
01:17:32,440 --> 01:17:35,520
我们的名声响亮
Our reputations precede us.

564
01:17:36,880 --> 01:17:38,200
对吧？
Don't they?

565
01:17:39,960 --> 01:17:45,240
勾勾 我知道你必须保护女主人
Gogo, I know you feel you must
protect your mistress.

566
01:17:46,400 --> 01:17:48,960
但是我乞求你...
But I beg you.

567
01:17:49,040 --> 01:17:50,680
快让开
Walk away.

568
01:17:57,760 --> 01:17:59,440
你这叫乞求？
You call that begging?

569
01:18:05,800 --> 01:18:08,280
你应该哀求才对
You can beg better than that.

570
01:21:22,320 --> 01:21:23,960
你和我想的一样吗？
Is that what I think it is?

571
01:21:24,040 --> 01:21:26,760
你不会认为有那么简单 对吧？
You didn't think it was
gonna be that easy, did you?

572
01:21:27,400 --> 01:21:34,160
你知道 我当时的确是这么认为
You know, for a second there,
yeah, I kind of did.

573
01:21:35,160 --> 01:21:36,920
傻孩子
Silly rabbit.

574
01:21:37,600 --> 01:21:38,400
孩子才会这样想
Trix are for...

575
01:21:38,480 --> 01:21:39,560
孩子们
Kids.

576
01:28:08,260 --> 01:28:12,980
这就是你混黑道的下场！
This is what you get
for fucking around with yakuzas!

577
01:28:13,060 --> 01:28:14,820
滚回家找你妈妈去吧！
Go home to your mother!

578
01:29:13,900 --> 01:29:19,020
你们这些侥幸还活着的 快逃命去吧
Those of you lucky enough to still
have your lives take them with you!

579
01:29:21,100 --> 01:29:22,340
但是...
However...

580
01:29:23,700 --> 01:29:27,660
留下你们的断肢
...leave the limbs you've lost.

581
01:29:28,900 --> 01:29:32,260
他们现在是我的了
They belong to me now.

582
01:29:36,700 --> 01:29:39,580
除了你 苏菲！
Except you, Sofie!

583
01:29:40,260 --> 01:29:43,580
你待在原地别动
You stay right where you are.

584
01:30:36,940 --> 01:30:39,420
你的兵器令人印象深刻
Your instrument
is quite impressive.

585
01:30:44,140 --> 01:30:45,740
哪里造的？
Where was it made?

586
01:30:47,540 --> 01:30:49,140
冲绳
Okinawa.

587
01:30:51,020 --> 01:30:53,940
是冲绳什么人打造的？
Whom in Okinawa made you this steel?

588
01:30:55,180 --> 01:30:57,100
这是服部半藏的
This is Hattori Hanzo steel.

589
01:30:57,180 --> 01:30:58,460
你说谎！
YOU LIE!

590
01:31:11,380 --> 01:31:13,700
虽然刀剑不会累
Swords however, never get tired.

591
01:31:15,020 --> 01:31:18,500
我希望你还留有足够的精力
Hope you've saved your energy.

592
01:31:22,180 --> 01:31:23,340
如果没有...
If you haven't...

593
01:31:25,500 --> 01:31:27,500
你撑不了五分钟的
...you might not last five minutes.

594
01:31:29,540 --> 01:31:31,740
从刚才的情况来看...
But as last looks go,

595
01:31:33,020 --> 01:31:35,580
你会更惨
you could do worse.

596
01:34:13,540 --> 01:34:18,060
你这傻傻的白人女孩 却偏偏爱玩日本武士刀
Silly Caucasian girl likes
to play with samurai swords.

597
01:34:20,460 --> 01:34:23,340
你虽然不能像武士般打斗...
You may not be able to fight
like a samurai.

598
01:34:26,380 --> 01:34:29,500
但是你却可以死得像个武士
But you can at least die
like a samurai.

599
01:34:59,900 --> 01:35:01,380
放马过来...
Attack me...

600
01:35:02,700 --> 01:35:04,260
...尽你所能
...with everything you have.

601
01:35:59,500 --> 01:36:02,300
我刚才看轻你了...
For ridiculing you earlier...

602
01:36:04,860 --> 01:36:06,780
我道歉
...I apologize.

603
01:36:15,340 --> 01:36:16,500
我接受
Accepted.

604
01:36:33,140 --> 01:36:34,060
准备好了？
Ready?

605
01:36:39,140 --> 01:36:40,300
来吧
Come on.

606
01:37:13,540 --> 01:37:22,420
那真的是一把服部半藏的刀
That really was a Hattori Hanzo sword.

607
01:39:28,580 --> 01:39:30,060
苏菲
Sofie.

608
01:39:30,740 --> 01:39:32,620
苏菲
Sofie.

609
01:39:32,700 --> 01:39:34,540
我的苏菲
My Sofie.

610
01:39:34,580 --> 01:39:36,740
真对不起
I'm so sorry.

611
01:39:40,100 --> 01:39:43,620
请，请宽恕我的背叛
Please.
Please forgive my betrayal.

612
01:39:43,700 --> 01:39:45,620
不要再提了
No more of that.

613
01:39:45,700 --> 01:39:47,460
但是...
But still...

614
01:39:47,540 --> 01:39:50,180
没什么可但是的...
But still nothing.

615
01:39:51,700 --> 01:39:58,460
除了我为了她对我聪慧的苏菲做的一切而感到心痛之外
Except my aching heart over what she's done
to my beautiful and brilliant Sofie.

616
01:39:59,220 --> 01:40:02,060
我让你活着有两个原因
I've kept you alive
for two reasons.

617
01:40:02,100 --> 01:40:05,220
第一 要问你话
The first reason is information.

618
01:40:05,220 --> 01:40:09,860
去死吧 你这愚蠢的金发女人 我什么也不会说
Burn in Hell, you stupid, stupid blonde! I'll tell you nothing.

619
01:40:11,140 --> 01:40:15,380
但是我还是要问你
But I am gonna ask you
questions.

620
01:40:15,460 --> 01:40:19,580
每次你不回答的话...
And every time
you don't give me answers,

621
01:40:19,620 --> 01:40:22,220
我就从你身上割点什么下来
I'm gonna cut something off.

622
01:40:22,980 --> 01:40:28,860
我保证 一定是你最怕失去的部分
And I promise you, they will be things you will miss!

623
01:40:29,460 --> 01:40:31,260
给我你的另一只手！
- Give me your other arm!

624
01:40:34,200 --> 01:40:38,920
我要所有有关致命毒蛇成员们的信息
I want all the information
on the Deadly Vipers.

625
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:40,160
如果让你猜...
If you had to guess...

626
01:40:40,240 --> 01:40:41,160
他们在干嘛...
What they've been doing.

627
01:40:41,240 --> 01:40:42,400
她为什么要留你活口
Why she left you alive...

628
01:40:42,480 --> 01:40:44,440
在哪里可以找到他们
And where I can find them.

629
01:40:44,480 --> 01:40:46,400
你的猜测是什么？
What would be your guess?

630
01:40:48,400 --> 01:40:51,320
我不需要猜
Guessing won't be necessary.

631
01:40:51,400 --> 01:40:53,280
她已经告诉我了
She informed me.

632
01:40:55,520 --> 01:40:59,520
她说我可以因为二个原因而保留我邪恶的生命
She said I could keep
my wicked life for two reasons.

633
01:41:00,360 --> 01:41:01,760
像我以前说的...
As I said before,

634
01:41:01,800 --> 01:41:06,440
我因为二个原因而让你继续你邪恶的生命
I've allowed you to keep your
wicked life for two reasons.

635
01:41:06,520 --> 01:41:11,960
第二个原因 是你可以亲口告诉他
And the second reason is
so you can tell him, in person

636
01:41:12,040 --> 01:41:15,800
今晚这里发生什么事...
everything that happened
here tonight.

637
01:41:15,840 --> 01:41:19,120
我要他亲眼见证我的慈悲...
I want him to witness
the extent of my mercy

638
01:41:19,200 --> 01:41:22,800
从你残破的身躯上看到
by witnessing
your deformed body.

639
01:41:22,880 --> 01:41:27,120
我要你告诉他所有你告诉我的讯息
I want you to tell him all the
information you just told me.

640
01:41:27,200 --> 01:41:30,240
我要他知道我所知道的
I want him to know what I know.

641
01:41:30,320 --> 01:41:34,040
我要他知道我想要他知道的
I want him to know
I want him to know.

642
01:41:34,560 --> 01:41:36,960
我要他们全部都知道...
And I want them all to know

643
01:41:37,040 --> 01:41:43,000
他们将会像尾莲一样死去
they'll all soon be
as dead as O-Ren.

644
01:42:07,200 --> 01:42:11,720
复仇不是一条直路
Revenge is never a straight line.

645
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:16,680
而是一片森林
It's a forest.

646
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:20,880
就像在森林里容易迷路...
And like a forest it's easy to lose your way...

647
01:42:22,040 --> 01:42:25,040
迷失了方向也忘了从哪里进来的
...to get lost... to forget where you came in.

648
01:42:28,520 --> 01:42:32,840
那个女人有报仇的权力
That woman deserves her revenge.

649
01:42:37,720 --> 01:42:42,080
还有 我们都该死
And we deserve to die.

650
01:42:45,480 --> 01:42:49,400
她应该受折磨直到咽下最后一口气
She must suffer
to her last breath.

651
01:43:02,160 --> 01:43:05,120
你是怎么找到我的？
How did you find me?

652
01:43:05,160 --> 01:43:06,840
别忘了我是什么人
I'm the man.

653
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:14,440
还有一件事，苏菲
One more thing, Sofie.

654
01:43:14,520 --> 01:43:18,600
她知不知道她女儿还活着？
Is she aware her daughter
is still aive?
