00:00:15,044 --> 00:00:17,545
BILL: Do you find me sadistic?

3
00:00:19,115 --> 00:00:21,550
You know, Kiddo,

4
00:00:21,617 --> 00:00:24,052
I'd like to believe

5
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:27,555
you're aware enough, even now,

6
00:00:27,623 --> 00:00:31,727
to know that there's
nothing sadistic

7
00:00:31,794 --> 00:00:34,864
in my actions.

8
00:00:34,932 --> 00:00:37,000
At this moment

9
00:00:38,536 --> 00:00:41,171
this is me

10
00:00:41,238 --> 00:00:43,974
at my most masochistic.

11
00:00:44,041 --> 00:00:46,776
Bill... it's your ba--

12
00:00:46,844 --> 00:00:49,112
(GUNSHOT)

13
00:00:53,018 --> 00:00:55,119
THE BRIDE: Looked dead, didn't I?

14
00:00:55,187 --> 00:00:56,855
Well, I wasn't.

15
00:00:56,923 --> 00:01:00,526
But it wasn't from lack of
trying, I can tell you that.

16
00:01:00,593 --> 00:01:03,762
Actually, Bill's last bullet
put me in a coma

17
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:07,767
a coma I was to lie in
for four years.

18
00:01:07,834 --> 00:01:10,136
When I woke up, I went on

19
00:01:10,204 --> 00:01:12,205
what the movie advertisements
refer to as

20
00:01:12,273 --> 00:01:15,809
"a roaring rampage
of revenge."

21
00:01:15,877 --> 00:01:18,912
I roared and I rampaged,

22
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:22,616
and I got bloody satisfaction.

23
00:01:22,684 --> 00:01:26,454
I've killed a hell of a lot of
people to get to this point,

24
00:01:26,522 --> 00:01:29,791
but I have only one more.

25
00:01:29,859 --> 00:01:31,994
The last one.

26
00:01:32,062 --> 00:01:35,531
The one I'm driving to
right now.

27
00:01:35,599 --> 00:01:38,435
The only one left.

28
00:01:38,502 --> 00:01:42,172
And when I arrive
at my destination,

29
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:45,543
I am gonna kill Bill.

32
00:02:10,905 --> 00:02:12,539
BRIDE: Now, the incident
that happened

33
00:02:12,607 --> 00:02:14,341
at the Two Pines Wedding Chapel

34
00:02:14,409 --> 00:02:17,545
that put this whole gory
story into motion

35
00:02:17,612 --> 00:02:20,248
has since become legend.

36
00:02:20,315 --> 00:02:23,084
"Massacre at Two Pines."

37
00:02:23,151 --> 00:02:25,086
That's what the newspapers
called it.

38
00:02:25,153 --> 00:02:26,787
The local TV news called it

39
00:02:26,855 --> 00:02:31,058
"The El Paso, Texas,
Wedding Chapel Massacre."

40
00:02:31,126 --> 00:02:33,827
How it happened,
who was there,

41
00:02:33,895 --> 00:02:36,897
how many got killed
and who killed them

42
00:02:36,965 --> 00:02:40,467
changes depending on
who's telling the story.

43
00:02:40,535 --> 00:02:42,202
In actual fact,

44
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:45,873
the massacre didn't happen
during a wedding at all.

45
00:02:45,941 --> 00:02:48,876
It was a wedding rehearsal.

46
00:02:48,944 --> 00:02:50,911
Now, when we come
to the part where I say,

47
00:02:50,979 --> 00:02:54,749
"You may kiss the bride,"
you may kiss the bride,

48
00:02:54,816 --> 00:02:57,851
but don't stick your tongue
in her mouth.

49
00:02:59,554 --> 00:03:02,122
This might be funny
to your friends,

50
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:05,393
but it would be embarrassing
to your parents.

51
00:03:06,862 --> 00:03:11,232
We'll try to restrain
ourselves, Reverend.

52
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:13,267
Y'all got a song?

53
00:03:16,472 --> 00:03:20,142
How 'bout "Love Me Tender"?
I can play that.

54
00:03:20,209 --> 00:03:22,077
Sure.
Yeah.

55
00:03:22,145 --> 00:03:24,646
"Love Me Tender"'d be great.

56
00:03:24,714 --> 00:03:27,750
Rufus - he's the man.

57
00:03:27,818 --> 00:03:30,887
Rufus, who was that
that you used to play for?

58
00:03:30,955 --> 00:03:32,956
Rufus Thomas.

59
00:03:33,024 --> 00:03:35,926
Rufus Thomas.
Rufus Thomas.

60
00:03:35,994 --> 00:03:38,862
I was a Drell.
I was a Drifter.

61
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:40,330
I was a Coaster.

62
00:03:40,398 --> 00:03:44,101
I was part of the Gang.
I was a Bar-Kay.

63
00:03:44,168 --> 00:03:48,239
If they come through Texas,
I played with 'em.

64
00:03:48,306 --> 00:03:52,009
Rufus - he's the man.

65
00:03:54,713 --> 00:03:57,147
Have I forgotten anything?
Um...

66
00:03:57,215 --> 00:04:00,684
Oh, yes. You forgot, uh,
the seating arrangements.

67
00:04:00,752 --> 00:04:03,420
Thank you, Mother.
Yes.

68
00:04:03,488 --> 00:04:05,789
Now, the way we
normally do this,

69
00:04:05,857 --> 00:04:08,059
we have the bride's side,

70
00:04:08,126 --> 00:04:10,161
and then we have
the groom's side.

71
00:04:10,228 --> 00:04:13,330
But since the bride
ain't got nobody comin',

72
00:04:13,398 --> 00:04:17,367
and the groom's got
far too many people comin'...

73
00:04:17,435 --> 00:04:20,337
Well, yeah, they're comin'
all the way from Oklahoma.

74
00:04:22,073 --> 00:04:26,544
Right... Well, I don't
see no problem with...

75
00:04:26,611 --> 00:04:29,847
the groom's side sharing
the bride's side.

76
00:04:29,915 --> 00:04:32,784
Do you, Mother?
I don't have a problem with that.

77
00:04:32,851 --> 00:04:34,819
But, uh...

78
00:04:34,886 --> 00:04:38,690
Honey, you know, it would be
good if you had somebody come.

79
00:04:38,758 --> 00:04:41,159
You know, as a sign
of good faith?

80
00:04:42,662 --> 00:04:45,297
Well, I don't have anybody,

81
00:04:45,364 --> 00:04:49,301
except for Tommy
and my friends.

82
00:04:49,369 --> 00:04:50,936
You have no family?

83
00:04:51,004 --> 00:04:53,973
Well, I'm workin'
on changing that.

84
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,741
Mrs. Harmony,
we're all the family

85
00:04:55,809 --> 00:04:59,579
this little angel's
ever gonna need.

86
00:04:59,647 --> 00:05:01,381
I'm not feeling very well,

87
00:05:01,449 --> 00:05:04,083
and this bitch is starting
to piss me off.

88
00:05:04,151 --> 00:05:05,718
So while y'all blather on,

89
00:05:05,786 --> 00:05:07,454
I'm gonna go outside and get some air.
Okay.

90
00:05:07,521 --> 00:05:10,690
Um, uh, Reverend,
sorry, uh...

91
00:05:10,758 --> 00:05:12,191
She's gonna go out
and get some air.

92
00:05:12,259 --> 00:05:14,393
Yeah. Given her delicate
condition.

93
00:05:14,461 --> 00:05:17,063
She just needs a few minutes to get it together.
She'll be Okay.

94
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:19,598
REVEREND: Right.

95
00:05:19,666 --> 00:05:21,834
(FLUTE)

96
00:06:36,579 --> 00:06:38,013
Hello, Kiddo.

97
00:06:43,253 --> 00:06:46,121
How did you find me?

98
00:06:46,188 --> 00:06:47,889
I'm the man.

99
00:06:51,194 --> 00:06:54,763
What are you doin' here?

100
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:56,732
What am I doin'?

101
00:06:58,502 --> 00:07:00,369
Well,

102
00:07:00,437 --> 00:07:03,673
a moment ago
I was playing my flute.

103
00:07:10,214 --> 00:07:13,250
At this moment

104
00:07:13,318 --> 00:07:15,319
I'm lookin' at the most
beautiful bride

105
00:07:15,387 --> 00:07:17,722
these old eyes have ever seen.

106
00:07:19,658 --> 00:07:23,161
Why are you here?
Last look.

107
00:07:25,664 --> 00:07:27,264
Are you gonna be nice?

108
00:07:27,332 --> 00:07:31,569
I've never been nice
my whole life.

109
00:07:31,636 --> 00:07:34,872
But I'll do my best
to be sweet.

110
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:37,141
Hmm.

111
00:07:37,208 --> 00:07:39,677
I always told you,

112
00:07:39,744 --> 00:07:42,813
your sweet side
is your best side.

113
00:07:42,881 --> 00:07:47,217
I guess that's why you're
the only one who's ever seen it.

114
00:07:49,621 --> 00:07:51,988
I see you got a bun
in the oven.

115
00:07:52,056 --> 00:07:56,994
Hmm. I'm knocked up.

116
00:07:57,061 --> 00:08:01,465
Jeez, Louise.
That young man of yours

117
00:08:01,532 --> 00:08:05,669
sure doesn't believe
in wasting time, does he?

118
00:08:05,737 --> 00:08:08,271
Have you seen Tommy?

119
00:08:10,274 --> 00:08:13,611
Big guy in the tux?
Yes.

120
00:08:13,678 --> 00:08:16,948
Then I saw him.

121
00:08:17,016 --> 00:08:20,418
I like his hair.

122
00:08:20,486 --> 00:08:24,856
You promised you'd be nice.

123
00:08:24,924 --> 00:08:29,427
No, I said I'd do my best.
That's hardly a promise.

124
00:08:29,495 --> 00:08:31,729
But you're right.

125
00:08:31,797 --> 00:08:36,633
What does your young man do
for a living?

126
00:08:36,701 --> 00:08:39,636
He owns a used-record store
here in El Paso.

127
00:08:39,704 --> 00:08:42,439
Ah. Music lover, eh?

128
00:08:42,507 --> 00:08:45,575
He's fond of music.

129
00:08:45,643 --> 00:08:47,410
Aren't we all?

130
00:08:51,448 --> 00:08:55,417
And what are you doing
for a J-O-B these days?

131
00:08:56,886 --> 00:08:59,855
I work in the record store.

132
00:08:59,922 --> 00:09:01,924
Aso.

133
00:09:03,493 --> 00:09:06,862
It all suddenly seems so clear.

134
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:14,470
Do you like it?
Yeah. I like it
a lot, smartass.

135
00:09:14,538 --> 00:09:18,675
I get to listen to music all
day, talk about music all day.

136
00:09:18,743 --> 00:09:21,912
It's really cool.

137
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:23,413
It's gonna be a great
environment

138
00:09:23,481 --> 00:09:25,449
for my little girl
to grow up in.

139
00:09:28,586 --> 00:09:33,289
As opposed to jetting
around the world, killing human beings

140
00:09:33,357 --> 00:09:35,925
and being paid
vast sums of money?

141
00:09:38,161 --> 00:09:39,561
Precisely.

142
00:09:39,629 --> 00:09:42,597
Well, my old friend,

143
00:09:42,665 --> 00:09:45,034
to each his own.

144
00:09:45,101 --> 00:09:48,904
However,
all cockblockery aside,

145
00:09:48,972 --> 00:09:53,175
I am looking forward
to meeting your young man.

146
00:09:53,242 --> 00:09:58,513
I happen to be, more or less,
particular whom my gal marries.

147
00:10:01,049 --> 00:10:02,984
You want to come
to the wedding?

148
00:10:03,051 --> 00:10:04,819
Only if I can sit
on the bride's side.

149
00:10:06,422 --> 00:10:08,990
You'll find it a bit lonely
on my side.

150
00:10:09,057 --> 00:10:12,494
Your side always
was a bit lonely.

151
00:10:12,561 --> 00:10:15,863
But I wouldn't sit
anywhere else.

152
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:20,068
You know,

153
00:10:20,136 --> 00:10:22,604
I had the loveliest dream
about you...

154
00:10:22,671 --> 00:10:25,073
Oh, here's Tommy!
Call me Arlene.

155
00:10:25,141 --> 00:10:27,542
You must be Tommy!
Uh-huh.

156
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:30,011
Arlene's told me
so much about you.

157
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:32,847
Honey, you Okay?
Oh, I'm fine.

158
00:10:32,915 --> 00:10:35,683
Tommy, I'd like you
to meet my father.

159
00:10:35,751 --> 00:10:38,686
Oh, my God!

160
00:10:38,754 --> 00:10:40,655
Oh, my God, this is great!

161
00:10:40,723 --> 00:10:43,458
I'm so glad to meet you,
sir... oh, Dad.

162

The name's Bill.

163
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:48,296
Well, it's great
to meet you... Bill.

164
00:10:48,364 --> 00:10:49,731
Arlene told me
you couldn't make it.

165
00:10:49,798 --> 00:10:53,001
Surprise.
That's my pop for ya.

166
00:10:53,068 --> 00:10:54,935
Always full of surprises.

167
00:10:55,003 --> 00:10:58,439
Well,
in the surprise department,

168
00:10:58,507 --> 00:11:01,876
the apple doesn't fall
far from the tree.

169
00:11:01,944 --> 00:11:04,078
When did you get in?
Just now.

170
00:11:04,146 --> 00:11:07,314
Did you come straight from Australia?
Of course.

171
00:11:07,382 --> 00:11:10,217
Daddy, I told Tommy that you
were in Perth mining for silver,

172
00:11:10,285 --> 00:11:13,386
and no one could reach you.

173
00:11:13,454 --> 00:11:16,656
Lucky for us all,
that's not the case.

174
00:11:16,724 --> 00:11:20,459
So... What's this all about?

175
00:11:20,527 --> 00:11:22,761
I've heard of
wedding rehearsals,

176
00:11:22,829 --> 00:11:24,664
but I don't believe
I've ever heard of

177
00:11:24,731 --> 00:11:26,966
a wedding dress rehearsal
before.

178
00:11:27,034 --> 00:11:29,702
We thought, "Why pay
so much money for a dress

179
00:11:29,770 --> 00:11:31,570
you're only gonna wear once?"

180
00:11:31,638 --> 00:11:34,740
Especially when Arlene looks
so goddamn beautiful in it.

181
00:11:34,808 --> 00:11:39,846
So I think we're gonna try
to get all the mileage we can out of it.

182
00:11:39,914 --> 00:11:42,182
Isn't it supposed to be
bad luck for the groom

183
00:11:42,249 --> 00:11:44,785
to see the bride
in her wedding dress

184
00:11:44,853 --> 00:11:46,220
before the ceremony?

185
00:11:46,288 --> 00:11:48,021
Well...

186
00:11:48,089 --> 00:11:50,657
I guess I just believe
in living dangerously.

187
00:11:52,527 --> 00:11:54,695
I know just what you mean.

188
00:11:54,763 --> 00:11:57,898

Some of us have places to be.

190
00:11:59,733 --> 00:12:02,168
Look, we gotta go through this
one more time,

191
00:12:02,235 --> 00:12:04,170
so why don't you have a s...

192
00:12:04,238 --> 00:12:06,172
Oh, my God.

193
00:12:06,239 --> 00:12:08,374
What am I thinking?
You should give her away!

194
00:12:08,442 --> 00:12:12,010
Tommy, that's not exactly
Daddy's cup of tea.

195
00:12:12,078 --> 00:12:14,580
I think Father would
be much more comfortable

196
00:12:14,648 --> 00:12:16,248
sitting with the rest
of the guests.

197
00:12:16,316 --> 00:12:17,449
Hmm. Really?

198
00:12:17,517 --> 00:12:19,652
That's asking a lot.

199
00:12:21,254 --> 00:12:23,956
Oh. Okay. Well, forget it.

200
00:12:24,024 --> 00:12:26,793
But how about we go
out to dinner tonight to celebrate?

201
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:29,596
Only on the condition
that I pay for everything.

202
00:12:29,663 --> 00:12:32,265
Deal. We got to do this now.

203
00:12:32,333 --> 00:12:36,437
Can I watch?
Absolutely. Have a seat.

204
00:12:36,505 --> 00:12:39,974
Which is the bride's side?
Right over here.

205

206
00:12:46,749 --> 00:12:49,451

You don't owe me a damn thing.

211

then go stand by him.

Oh, yes.

213

Nah, there wasn't
really 88 of 'em.

I guess they thought
it sounded cool.

227
00:15:24,741 --> 00:15:28,477
Anyhow, they all fell
under her Hanzo sword.

228
00:15:28,545 --> 00:15:30,479
She got a Hanzo sword?

229
00:15:30,547 --> 00:15:32,581
He made one for her.

230
00:15:32,649 --> 00:15:36,085
Didn't he swear a blood oath
to never make another sword?

231

It would appear
he has broken it.

to hold a grudge, don't they?

to bring that out in people.

I know this is a ridiculous

kept up with your... swordplay?

in some time,

and the last time we spoke
wasn't the most pleasant,

that you're not doing the job

Once upon a time

493
00:39:39,304 --> 00:39:42,139
in China,

494
00:39:42,207 --> 00:39:49,647
some believe around the year
one, double aught, three,

495
00:39:49,714 --> 00:39:52,850
head priest of
the White Lotus Clan, Pai Mei,

496
00:39:52,918 --> 00:39:57,121
was walking down a road

497
00:39:57,189 --> 00:39:59,323
contemplating whatever it is

498
00:39:59,391 --> 00:40:05,463
that a man of Pai Mei's
infinite powers would contemplate

499
00:40:05,531 --> 00:40:09,869
which is another way
of saying "Who knows?"

500
00:40:09,936 --> 00:40:13,205
when a Shaolin monk
appeared on the road,

501
00:40:13,273 --> 00:40:15,774
traveling in the opposite
direction.

502
00:40:15,842 --> 00:40:20,280
As the monk and the priest
crossed paths,

503
00:40:20,347 --> 00:40:22,482
Pai Mei,

504
00:40:22,549 --> 00:40:28,020
in a practically unfathomable
display of generosity,

505
00:40:28,088 --> 00:40:33,124
gave the monk
the slightest of nods.

506
00:40:33,192 --> 00:40:35,226
The nod

507
00:40:35,294 --> 00:40:37,528
was not returned.

508
00:40:37,596 --> 00:40:40,764
(PLAYING NOTE)

509
00:40:40,832 --> 00:40:44,134
Now, was it the intention
of the Shaolin monk

510
00:40:44,202 --> 00:40:47,104
to insult Pai Mei?

511
00:40:47,171 --> 00:40:52,175
Or did he just fail to see
the generous social gesture?

512
00:40:52,243 --> 00:40:57,214
The motives of the monk
remain unknown.

513
00:40:57,282 --> 00:40:59,383
What is known

514
00:40:59,450 --> 00:41:02,185
were the consequences.

515
00:41:03,287 --> 00:41:05,689
(FLUTE PLAYING)

516
00:41:13,698 --> 00:41:16,033
The next morning,

517
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:20,404
Pai Mei appeared
at the Shaolin temple

518
00:41:20,472 --> 00:41:23,674
and demanded
of the temple's head abbot

519
00:41:23,742 --> 00:41:30,448
that he offer Pai Mei his neck
to repay the insult.

520
00:41:30,516 --> 00:41:34,886
The abbot, at first,
tried to console Pai Mei,

521
00:41:34,954 --> 00:41:38,857
only to find Pai Mei was

522
00:41:38,925 --> 00:41:40,626
inconsolable.

523
00:41:40,694 --> 00:41:42,861
(FLUTE PLAYING)

524
00:41:52,004 --> 00:41:54,371
So began

525
00:41:54,439 --> 00:41:56,974
the Massacre
of the Shaolin Temple

526
00:41:57,041 --> 00:42:00,243
and all sixty
of the monks inside,

527
00:42:00,311 --> 00:42:03,846
at the fists of the White Lotus.

528
00:42:03,914 --> 00:42:07,817
And so began the legend

529
00:42:07,885 --> 00:42:12,188
of Pai Mei's Five-Point-Palm
Exploding-Heart Technique.

530
00:42:12,256 --> 00:42:13,456
And what, pray tell,

531
00:42:13,524 --> 00:42:16,159
is the Five-Point-Palm
Exploding-Heart Technique?

532
00:42:16,226 --> 00:42:22,031
Quite simply, the deadliest blow
in all of martial arts.

533
00:42:23,768 --> 00:42:27,304
He hits you with his fingertips

534
00:42:27,371 --> 00:42:31,308
at five different pressure
points on your body,

535
00:42:31,376 --> 00:42:35,512
and then lets you walk away.

536
00:42:35,579 --> 00:42:38,448
But once you've taken five steps

537
00:42:38,515 --> 00:42:42,552
your heart explodes
inside your body

538
00:42:42,620 --> 00:42:46,790
and you fall to the floor, dead.

539
00:42:46,857 --> 00:42:50,861
Did he teach you that?
No.

540
00:42:50,928 --> 00:42:55,967
He teaches no one the Five-Point-Palm
Exploding-Heart Technique.

541
00:42:56,034 --> 00:42:58,403
Now,

542
00:42:58,470 --> 00:43:03,174
one of the things I've always
liked about you, Kiddo,

543
00:43:05,110 --> 00:43:08,646
is you appear wise
beyond your years.

544
00:43:11,950 --> 00:43:16,587
So, allow me to impart
a word to the wise.

545
00:43:16,655 --> 00:43:18,289
Whatever...

546
00:43:18,357 --> 00:43:22,327
Whatever Pai Mei says, obey.

547
00:43:23,729 --> 00:43:27,432
If you flash him, even for
an instant, a defiant eye,

548
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:29,834
he'll pluck it out.

549
00:43:29,902 --> 00:43:34,205
And if you throw
any American sass his way,

550
00:43:34,273 --> 00:43:38,443
he'll snap your back and your
neck like they were twigs.

551
00:43:40,846 --> 00:43:43,781
And that will be
the story of you.

552
00:43:46,418 --> 00:43:48,419
(FLUTE)

553
00:44:04,067 --> 00:44:06,635
He'll accept you as his student.

554
00:44:06,703 --> 00:44:08,704
What happened to you?
Nothin'.

555
00:44:08,771 --> 00:44:11,940
Get in a fight?
Friendly contest.

556
00:44:12,008 --> 00:44:13,542
Why did he accept me?

557
00:44:13,609 --> 00:44:17,779
Because he's a very,
very, very old man.

558
00:44:17,847 --> 00:44:21,083
And, like all rotten bastards,

559
00:44:21,151 --> 00:44:26,321
when they become old,
they get lonely.

560
00:44:26,389 --> 00:44:29,358
Which has no effect
on their dispositions,

561
00:44:29,425 --> 00:44:34,129
but it does teach them
the value of company.

562
00:44:34,197 --> 00:44:36,765
Whew. Oh.

563
00:44:36,833 --> 00:44:42,304
(SIGHS) Just seein' those
steps again makes me ache.

You're gonna have a lot of fun
carrying buckets of water

568
00:44:57,954 --> 00:44:59,654
What?
Nothin'.

569
00:44:59,722 --> 00:45:03,191
When he tells me you're done.

570
00:45:03,259 --> 00:45:04,926
When do you think
that might be?

571
00:45:04,994 --> 00:45:07,929
That, my dearest,
depends entirely on you.

572
00:45:07,997 --> 00:45:11,666
Now remember,
no sarcasm, no back talk.

573
00:45:11,734 --> 00:45:14,102
At least not
for the first year or so.

574
00:45:14,170 --> 00:45:17,272
You're gonna have to
let him warm up to you.

575
00:45:17,340 --> 00:45:21,208
He hates Caucasians,
despises Americans,

576
00:45:21,276 --> 00:45:24,078
and has nothing
but contempt for women.

577
00:45:26,448 --> 00:45:30,852
So in your case...
it might take a little while.

compare to that?

a Hanzo sword,

you compare it to every
other sword ever made -

longer so they can do it.

I've always figured that

warriors and their enemies
share the same relationship.

You're dead!

BEATRIX: Like most men
who never knew their father,

820
01:22:26,879 --> 01:22:29,602
Bill collected father figures.

821
01:22:29,670 --> 01:22:32,626
The first was Esteban Vihaio.

822
01:22:32,694 --> 01:22:36,781
Esteban was a pimp
and a friend of Bill's mother.

823
01:22:36,848 --> 01:22:40,931
He ran a brothel in Acuna,
Mexico, for over 50 years.

824
01:22:40,999 --> 01:22:43,292
His army, the Acuna Boys,

825
01:22:43,360 --> 01:22:46,980
made up of the fatherless
offspring of his whores, ran Acuna.

826
01:22:47,048 --> 01:22:50,371
He ran the Acuna Boys.

827
01:22:52,033 --> 01:22:53,563
Now, at the age of 80,

828
01:22:53,630 --> 01:22:57,083
it would be this retired
gentleman of leisure

829
01:22:57,151 --> 01:23:00,575
who could point me
in Bill's direction.

830
01:23:02,069 --> 01:23:04,529
Señor Esteban Vihaio?

831
01:23:05,957 --> 01:23:07,320
Yes.

832
01:23:07,388 --> 01:23:09,380
May I join you?

833
01:23:11,408 --> 01:23:14,564
Only on the condition
that you call me Esteban.

834
01:23:14,632 --> 01:23:19,182
May I join you, Esteban?
Please.

I speak a little Spanish,
if you prefer.

838
01:23:29,585 --> 01:23:33,172
No, no, no, no.
I prefer English.

839
01:23:33,239 --> 01:23:35,695
I haven't spoken it in a while,

840
01:23:35,763 --> 01:23:39,120
but I would relish
the opportunity to converse

841
01:23:39,188 --> 01:23:42,044
with such a pretty
companion as yourself.

842
01:23:42,112 --> 01:23:44,071
It's my pleasure to be
in the company

843
01:23:44,139 --> 01:23:45,999
of such a fine gentleman
as yourself.

844
01:23:46,067 --> 01:23:49,557
I must warn you, young lady,

845
01:23:49,621 --> 01:23:52,482
I am susceptible to flattery.

846
01:23:55,670 --> 01:23:57,696
How may I be of service to you?

847
01:24:06,108 --> 01:24:07,767
Where's Bill?

848
01:24:10,062 --> 01:24:12,685
Ahh.

849
01:24:12,752 --> 01:24:16,772
You must be Beatrix.

850
01:24:16,840 --> 01:24:20,097
I can see the attraction.

851
01:24:21,658 --> 01:24:24,848
I remember when Bill
was only five years old,

852
01:24:24,916 --> 01:24:26,975
I took him to the movies.

853
01:24:27,043 --> 01:24:30,797
It was a movie
starring Lana Turner.

854
01:24:30,865 --> 01:24:35,849
The Postman Always Ring Twice,
with John Garfield.

855
01:24:35,917 --> 01:24:39,174
And whenever she would
appear on the screen,

856
01:24:39,241 --> 01:24:42,298
Bill would begin compulsively
to suck his thumb

857
01:24:42,366 --> 01:24:44,822
to an obscene amount.

858
01:24:44,890 --> 01:24:50,549
And I knew from this very moment
this boy was a fool for blondes.

859
01:24:56,035 --> 01:24:58,136
Mmm.

860
01:24:58,204 --> 01:24:59,872
You know,

861
01:24:59,940 --> 01:25:03,810
being a fool for a woman
such as yourself

862
01:25:03,878 --> 01:25:07,214
is always the right thing to do.

863
01:25:09,283 --> 01:25:14,254
If we had met
when I was back in business,

864
01:25:14,322 --> 01:25:18,925
you would have been
my number-one lady.

865
01:25:21,362 --> 01:25:25,598
Well, I'm flattered.
You goddamn well better be.

866
01:25:27,600 --> 01:25:31,870
This... I heard you
were driving a truck.

867
01:25:31,938 --> 01:25:34,873
My Pussy Wagon died on me.

868
01:25:34,941 --> 01:25:38,476
The Pussy died. Hmm.

869
01:25:40,712 --> 01:25:43,481
Bill shot you in the head, no?

870
01:25:43,548 --> 01:25:47,351
Yes.
Hmm.

871
01:25:47,419 --> 01:25:50,521
I would have been much nicer.

872
01:25:50,588 --> 01:25:52,923
I would have just cut your face.

873
01:25:55,960 --> 01:25:57,594
You must forgive me.

874
01:25:57,662 --> 01:26:01,031

a drink with me.

Bill.

Yeah. Hmm.

on the road to Salina.

I will draw you a map.

Bill is like a son to me.

Do you know why I help you?
No.

888
01:27:12,136 --> 01:27:15,573
Because he would want me to.

889
01:27:15,640 --> 01:27:18,008
Now, that I don't believe.

890

01:27:20,579 --> 01:27:23,815

going to see you again?

01:28:34,755 --> 01:28:36,755
Bang, bang! Oh!

894
01:28:36,823 --> 01:28:39,592
Oh! She got us, B.B.
Mommy got us.

895
01:28:39,660 --> 01:28:42,061
Oh, I'm dying.

Mommy shot us.

898

But little did
Quickdraw Kiddo know

899
01:28:55,475 --> 01:28:58,477
that little B.B.
was only playing possum,

900
01:28:58,545 --> 01:29:03,649
due to the fact that
she was impervious to bullets.

901
01:29:03,717 --> 01:29:05,851
I am pervious
to bullets, Mommy.

902
01:29:05,919 --> 01:29:09,521
Hey, get back down there.
You're playing possum.

903
01:29:09,589 --> 01:29:15,326
So, as the smirking killer
advanced on what she thought

904
01:29:15,394 --> 01:29:21,132
was a bullet-ridden corpse,
that's when little B.B. fired.

905
01:29:23,001 --> 01:29:25,102
Bang, bang!

906
01:29:31,910 --> 01:29:36,181
You're dead, Mommy. So die.

907
01:29:37,150 --> 01:29:39,184
Oh!

908
01:29:41,755 --> 01:29:43,890

909
01:29:46,827 --> 01:29:50,697
Oh! B.B....

910
01:29:50,765 --> 01:29:53,033
(GRUNTS)

911
01:29:53,101 --> 01:29:56,203
I should've known.

912
01:29:56,271 --> 01:29:59,606
You are... the best.

913
01:30:06,481 --> 01:30:09,517
Oh, Mommy. Don't die.

914
01:30:09,585 --> 01:30:11,619
I was just playing.

915
01:30:16,993 --> 01:30:19,528
I know.

916
01:30:32,675 --> 01:30:35,743
I told her that you were asleep,

917
01:30:35,811 --> 01:30:40,647
but that one day you'd wake up
and come back to her.

918
01:30:40,715 --> 01:30:44,884
And she asked me, "If Mommy's
been asleep since I was born,

919
01:30:44,952 --> 01:30:47,754
then how will she know
what I look like?"

920
01:30:47,821 --> 01:30:53,460
To which I replied, "Because
Mommy's been dreaming of you."

921
01:30:55,529 --> 01:30:57,964
That's what I said.

922
01:30:58,032 --> 01:31:02,702
Did you dream of me?
I dreamed of you.

923
01:31:02,770 --> 01:31:06,473
Every single night, baby.
Every single night.

924
01:31:06,540 --> 01:31:10,710
I waited a long time
for you to wake up, Mommy.

925
01:31:21,722 --> 01:31:25,457
Now, let me look at you.

926
01:31:25,525 --> 01:31:27,659
Oh.

927
01:31:30,930 --> 01:31:34,866
My, my, my, what a pretty
little girl you are.

928
01:31:34,934 --> 01:31:37,703
You're pretty too, Mommy.

929
01:31:42,976 --> 01:31:46,612
Tell Mommy what you said
when I showed you her picture.

930
01:31:46,680 --> 01:31:47,780
Mm-mm.

931
01:31:47,848 --> 01:31:50,516
Come on, shy girl.
Mm-mm.

932
01:31:50,584 --> 01:31:53,252
Come on.
You know what you said.

933
01:31:53,320 --> 01:31:56,755
Come on. Tell Mommy.
It'll make her feel good.

934
01:31:56,823 --> 01:31:58,690
Come on.
Mm-mm.

935
01:31:58,758 --> 01:32:00,159
Yeah. Come on.

936
01:32:00,226 --> 01:32:02,794
I said... I said

937
01:32:02,862 --> 01:32:04,897
"You're the most
beautifulest woman

938

939
01:32:10,803 --> 01:32:14,373
That's the truth.
That's what she said.

940
01:32:14,441 --> 01:32:19,245
B.B., don't you think Mommy
has the prettiest hair

941
01:32:19,312 --> 01:32:21,214
in the whole wide world?

942
01:32:21,281 --> 01:32:25,151
Yes, I do.
Matter of fact, it's better than pretty.

943
01:32:26,620 --> 01:32:31,224
What's better than pretty?
Mmm... Gorgeous.

944
01:32:31,292 --> 01:32:34,794
Very good. Gorgeous.

945
01:32:34,862 --> 01:32:38,198
Mommy is gorgeous.

946
01:32:38,266 --> 01:32:44,037
Hmm. You know, sweetie,
Mommy's kinda mad at Daddy.

947
01:32:44,105 --> 01:32:47,074
Why, Daddy?
Were you being a bad daddy?

948
01:32:47,141 --> 01:32:52,779
I'm afraid I was.
I was a real bad daddy.

949
01:32:52,847 --> 01:32:56,818
Our little girl learned about
life and death the other day.

950
01:32:56,885 --> 01:33:01,389
Wanna tell Mommy about
what happened to Emilio?

951
01:33:03,725 --> 01:33:06,660
I killed him.

952
01:33:06,728 --> 01:33:11,833
Emilio was her goldfish.
Emilio was my goldfiss.

953
01:33:11,901 --> 01:33:14,169
She came running into my room,

954
01:33:14,237 --> 01:33:16,639
holding the fish in her hand
and crying,

955
01:33:16,707 --> 01:33:19,642
"Daddy! Daddy! Emilio's dead."

956
01:33:21,412 --> 01:33:25,415
And I said,
"Really? That's so sad."

957
01:33:25,483 --> 01:33:27,650
"How did he die?"

958
01:33:27,718 --> 01:33:30,820
And what did you say?
I stepped on him.

959
01:33:30,888 --> 01:33:36,092
Actually, young lady, the words
you so strategically used were

960
01:33:36,160 --> 01:33:40,096
"I accidentally stepped on him."

961
01:33:40,164 --> 01:33:42,064
To which I queried,

962
01:33:42,132 --> 01:33:44,901
"And just how did
your foot accidentally

963
01:33:44,969 --> 01:33:47,703
find its way
into Emilio's fishbowl?"

964
01:33:47,771 --> 01:33:49,138
And she said, "No, no, no.

965
01:33:49,206 --> 01:33:52,041
Emilio was on the carpet
when I stepped on him."

966
01:33:52,109 --> 01:33:56,046
Mmm. The plot thickens.

967
01:33:56,114 --> 01:34:01,084
"And just how did Emilio
get on the carpet?"

968
01:34:01,152 --> 01:34:04,922
And, Mommy, you would've
been so proud of her.

969
01:34:06,491 --> 01:34:08,892
She didn't lie.

970
01:34:08,960 --> 01:34:13,130
She said she took Emilio
out of his bowl

971
01:34:13,198 --> 01:34:16,667
and put him on the carpet.

972
01:34:18,270 --> 01:34:22,340
And what was Emilio
doing on the carpet?

973
01:34:22,407 --> 01:34:25,276
Flapping.

974
01:34:25,344 --> 01:34:28,781
And then you stomped on him.
Uh-huh.

975
01:34:28,848 --> 01:34:33,019
And when you lifted up
your foot,

976
01:34:33,087 --> 01:34:37,257
what was Emilio doing then?
Nothing.

977
01:34:37,325 --> 01:34:40,060
He stopped flapping,
didn't he?

978
01:34:42,463 --> 01:34:44,932
She told me later

979
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:47,401
that the second
she lifted up her foot

980
01:34:47,469 --> 01:34:51,705
and saw Emilio not flapping,
she knew what she had done.

981
01:34:51,773 --> 01:34:56,844
Is that not the perfect
visual image of life and death?

982
01:34:56,912 --> 01:34:59,080
A fish flapping on the carpet,

983
01:34:59,147 --> 01:35:02,483
and a fish not flapping
on the carpet.

984
01:35:04,219 --> 01:35:06,086
So powerful,

985
01:35:06,154 --> 01:35:09,656
even a four-year-old
with no concept of life or death

986
01:35:09,724 --> 01:35:11,791
knew what it meant.

987
01:35:13,727 --> 01:35:16,596
You loved Emilio, didn't you?
Uh-huh.

988
01:35:16,663 --> 01:35:19,932
Well, I love Mommy, too.

989
01:35:21,268 --> 01:35:23,469
But I did to Mommy
what you did to Emilio.

990
01:35:23,536 --> 01:35:27,406
You stomped on Mommy?
Worse.

991
01:35:27,473 --> 01:35:29,241
I shot Mommy.

992
01:35:29,309 --> 01:35:32,912
Not pretend shooting
like we were just doing.

993
01:35:32,979 --> 01:35:34,647
I shot her for real.

994
01:35:34,715 --> 01:35:37,216
Why? Did you want to see
what would happen?

995
01:35:37,284 --> 01:35:42,055
No, I knew what would happen
to Mommy if I shot her.

996
01:35:42,122 --> 01:35:44,090
What I didn't know was,

997
01:35:44,158 --> 01:35:46,560
when I shot Mommy,
what would happen to me.

998
01:35:46,627 --> 01:35:50,463
What happened?
I was very sad.

999
01:35:52,666 --> 01:35:54,834
And that's when I learned

1000
01:35:54,902 --> 01:35:59,974
some things, once you do,
they can never be undone.

1001
01:36:02,911 --> 01:36:08,349
What happened to Mommy?
Why don't you ask Mommy?

1002
01:36:08,417 --> 01:36:11,585
You OK, Mommy? Did it hurt?

1003
01:36:11,653 --> 01:36:13,721
No, sweetie.

1004
01:36:15,491 --> 01:36:17,792
Doesn't hurt anymore.

1005
01:36:23,432 --> 01:36:26,734
Did it make you sick?

1006
01:36:26,802 --> 01:36:31,272
No. It made me sleep.

1007
01:36:31,339 --> 01:36:34,375
That's why I haven't been with you, B.B.
I've been asleep.

1008
01:36:34,443 --> 01:36:37,745
But you're awake now, Mommy.
Right?

1009
01:36:37,813 --> 01:36:40,915
I'm wide awake, pretty girl.

1010
01:36:40,983 --> 01:36:44,586
B.B., would you like Mommy
to watch a video with you

1011
01:36:44,654 --> 01:36:46,321
before sleepy time?

1012
01:36:46,389 --> 01:36:47,822
Uh-huh.

1013
01:36:47,890 --> 01:36:51,659
Mommy, do you wanna
watch a video with me before sleepy time?

1014
01:36:51,727 --> 01:36:54,429
Oh, yeah! I would love to.

1015
01:36:54,496 --> 01:36:56,898
Which one do you wanna watch?
Shogun Assassin.

1016
01:36:56,965 --> 01:36:59,767
No, B.B. Shogun Assassin
is too long.

1017
01:36:59,835 --> 01:37:03,838
Mm-mm.
No, it's not.

1018
01:37:03,905 --> 01:37:06,507
Well, then,

1019
01:37:06,575 --> 01:37:09,009
I'll leave you ladies to it.

1020
01:37:14,949 --> 01:37:20,387
BOY: When I was little,
my father was famous.

1021
01:37:20,455 --> 01:37:24,892
He was the greatest samurai
in the empire.

1022
01:37:24,960 --> 01:37:28,129
And he was the shogun's
decapitator.

1023
01:37:28,197 --> 01:37:33,468
He cut off the heads
of 131 lords.

1024
01:37:33,536 --> 01:37:36,137
My father would
come home to Mother,

1025
01:37:36,205 --> 01:37:38,173
and when he would see her

1026
01:37:38,240 --> 01:37:40,842
he would forget
about the killings.

1027
01:37:40,909 --> 01:37:43,010
He wasn't scared of the shogun,

1028
01:37:43,078 --> 01:37:46,080
but the shogun
was scared of him.

1029
01:37:46,148 --> 01:37:48,849
Maybe that was the problem.

1030
01:37:48,917 --> 01:37:51,885
One night, the shogun sent...

I was just admiring your sword.

1052
01:40:16,426 --> 01:40:19,962
Quite a piece of work.

1053
01:40:20,030 --> 01:40:24,867
Speaking of which,
how is Hanzo-san?

1054
01:40:24,935 --> 01:40:28,304
He's good.

1055
01:40:28,372 --> 01:40:31,407
Has his sushi
gotten any better?

1056
01:40:34,578 --> 01:40:39,215
You know, I couldn't believe it.
You got him to make you a sword.

1057
01:40:39,283 --> 01:40:41,384
It was easy.

1058
01:40:41,452 --> 01:40:43,619
I just dropped your name, Bill.

1059
01:40:43,687 --> 01:40:45,855
That'd do it.

1060
01:40:58,702 --> 01:41:04,741
♪ Well, no one told me
about her

1061
01:41:11,416 --> 01:41:17,021
♪ Well, no one told me
about her

1062
01:41:17,088 --> 01:41:20,891
I suppose the idea is
we cross Hanzo swords.

1063
01:41:20,959 --> 01:41:24,261
Am I right?

1064
01:41:24,329 --> 01:41:27,598
Well, it just so happens

1065
01:41:27,665 --> 01:41:31,268
this hacienda has
its own private beach.

1066
01:41:31,336 --> 01:41:33,437
And that private beach
just so happens

1067
01:41:33,504 --> 01:41:35,539
to look particularly beautiful

1068
01:41:35,607 --> 01:41:38,609
bathed in moonlight.

1069
01:41:38,676 --> 01:41:41,479
And there just so happens
to be a full moon out tonight.

1070
01:41:41,546 --> 01:41:44,448
So, sword fighter,

1071
01:41:44,516 --> 01:41:48,319
if you want a sword fight,
that's where I suggest.

1072
01:41:48,387 --> 01:41:52,690
But if you wanna be
old school about it

1073
01:41:52,758 --> 01:41:56,327
and you know
I'm all about old school

1074
01:41:56,395 --> 01:42:00,164
then we could wait until dawn
and slice each other up at sunrise

1075
01:42:00,232 --> 01:42:02,533
like a couple
of real-life, honest...

1076
01:42:04,436 --> 01:42:07,372
Now, if you don't settle down,

1077
01:42:07,439 --> 01:42:09,774
I'm gonna have to put one
in your kneecap.

1078
01:42:09,842 --> 01:42:13,078
And I hear tell that's
a very painful place to get shot in.

1079
01:42:15,182 --> 01:42:17,717
(LAUGHS)

1080
01:42:17,784 --> 01:42:20,353
I'm just fuckin' with you.

1081
01:42:20,421 --> 01:42:25,459
Now, when it comes to you

1082
01:42:25,526 --> 01:42:27,561
and us

1083
01:42:29,163 --> 01:42:32,298
I have a few
unanswered questions.

1084
01:42:32,366 --> 01:42:36,270
So, before this tale
of bloody revenge

1085
01:42:36,337 --> 01:42:38,338
reaches its climax,

1086
01:42:38,406 --> 01:42:41,175
I'm gonna ask you
some questions,

1087
01:42:41,242 --> 01:42:44,211
and I want you
to tell me the truth.

1088
01:42:44,278 --> 01:42:48,583
However, therein lies a dilemma.

1089
01:42:48,650 --> 01:42:51,185
Because when it comes
to the subject of me,

1090
01:42:51,253 --> 01:42:54,589
I believe you are
truly and utterly

1091
01:42:54,657 --> 01:42:56,591
incapable of telling the truth.

1092
01:42:56,659 --> 01:43:01,029
Especially to me.
And least of all, to yourself.

1093
01:43:01,097 --> 01:43:04,600
And when it comes
to the subject of me,

1094
01:43:04,667 --> 01:43:07,236
I am truly and utterly

1095
01:43:07,303 --> 01:43:11,474
incapable of believing
anything you say.

1096
01:43:11,542 --> 01:43:13,409
How do you suppose
we solve this dilemma?

1097
01:43:13,477 --> 01:43:17,514
Well, it just so happens,

1098
01:43:17,582 --> 01:43:19,684
I have a solution.

1099
01:43:19,751 --> 01:43:22,186
Agh!
Gotcha!

1100
01:43:22,254 --> 01:43:24,422
(GRUNTING) God damn!

1101
01:43:24,490 --> 01:43:26,858
(LAUGHS)

1102
01:43:26,926 --> 01:43:30,362
What the fuck did you
just shoot me with?

1103
01:43:30,430 --> 01:43:34,066
My greatest invention.
Or at least my favorite.

1104
01:43:34,134 --> 01:43:35,768
Don't touch it,

1105
01:43:35,836 --> 01:43:37,804
or I'll stick another one
right in your cheek.

1106
01:43:42,476 --> 01:43:44,877
What lies within that dart,

1107
01:43:44,945 --> 01:43:48,815
just begging to course
its way through your veins

1108
01:43:48,883 --> 01:43:50,784
is an incredibly potent

1109
01:43:50,852 --> 01:43:53,420
and quite infallible
truth serum.

1110
01:43:53,488 --> 01:43:56,623
I call it
"The Undisputed Truth."

1111
01:43:56,691 --> 01:43:59,092
Twice as strong
as sodium pentothal,

1112
01:43:59,160 --> 01:44:02,196
with no druggie aftereffects.

1113
01:44:02,263 --> 01:44:07,968
Except for a slight wave
of euphoria. You feel it?

1114
01:44:08,036 --> 01:44:10,604
Euphoria?
Yeah.

1115
01:44:10,672 --> 01:44:13,774
No.
Too bad.

1116
01:44:15,210 --> 01:44:17,578
As you know,

1117
01:44:17,645 --> 01:44:21,015
I'm quite keen on comic books.

1118
01:44:21,083 --> 01:44:24,718
Especially the ones
about superheroes.

1119
01:44:24,786 --> 01:44:30,356
I find the whole mythology
surrounding superheroes fascinating.

1120
01:44:30,424 --> 01:44:35,027
Take my favorite superhero,
Superman.

1121
01:44:35,095 --> 01:44:38,197
Not a great comic book.
Not particularly well drawn.

1122
01:44:39,766 --> 01:44:41,466
Mmm.

1123
01:44:41,534 --> 01:44:44,035
But the mythology...

1124
01:44:44,103 --> 01:44:47,471
The mythology is not only
great, it's unique.

1125
01:44:47,539 --> 01:44:51,809
How long does this shit take
to go into effect?

1126
01:44:51,877 --> 01:44:53,244
About two minutes.

1127
01:44:53,312 --> 01:44:55,780
Just long enough for me
to finish my point.

1128
01:44:55,848 --> 01:45:01,186
Now, a staple of
the superhero mythology is,

1129
01:45:01,254 --> 01:45:04,156
there's the superhero
and there's the alter ego.

1130
01:45:04,224 --> 01:45:06,391
Batman is actually Bruce Wayne,

1131
01:45:06,459 --> 01:45:09,661
Spider-Man is actually
Peter Parker.

1132
01:45:09,729 --> 01:45:11,629
When that character
wakes up in the morning,

1133
01:45:11,697 --> 01:45:13,431
he's Peter Parker.

1134
01:45:13,499 --> 01:45:18,670
He has to put on a costume
to become Spider-Man.

1135
01:45:18,738 --> 01:45:24,642
And it is in that characteristic
Superman stands alone.

1136
01:45:24,710 --> 01:45:27,478
Superman didn't become Superman.

1137
01:45:27,546 --> 01:45:30,348
Superman was born Superman.

1138
01:45:30,415 --> 01:45:34,652
When Superman wakes up
in the morning, he's Superman.

1139
01:45:34,720 --> 01:45:38,256
His alter ego is Clark Kent.

1140
01:45:38,324 --> 01:45:41,526
His outfit with the big red "S,"

1141
01:45:41,594 --> 01:45:43,795
that's the blanket
he was wrapped in as a baby

1142
01:45:43,863 --> 01:45:48,066
when the Kents found him.
Those are his clothes.

1143
01:45:48,134 --> 01:45:51,536
What Kent wears - the glasses,
the business suit

1144
01:45:51,604 --> 01:45:53,438
that's the costume.

1145
01:45:53,506 --> 01:45:58,243
That's the costume Superman
wears to blend in with us.

1146
01:45:59,679 --> 01:46:03,148
Clark Kent is how Superman
views us.

1147
01:46:03,216 --> 01:46:06,584
And what are the characteristics
of Clark Kent?

1148
01:46:06,652 --> 01:46:08,920
He's weak,

1149
01:46:08,988 --> 01:46:11,923
he's unsure of himself,

1150
01:46:11,990 --> 01:46:14,692
he's a coward.

1151
01:46:14,760 --> 01:46:17,195
Clark Kent is
Superman's critique

1152
01:46:17,262 --> 01:46:19,898
on the whole human race.

1153
01:46:21,333 --> 01:46:26,104
Sorta like Beatrix Kiddo
and Mrs. Tommy Plympton.

1154
01:46:27,273 --> 01:46:29,441
Aso.

1155
01:46:29,508 --> 01:46:31,843
The point emerges.

1156
01:46:33,546 --> 01:46:37,015
You would've worn the costume
of Arlene Plympton.

1157
01:46:37,083 --> 01:46:40,852
But you were born Beatrix Kiddo.

1158
01:46:40,920 --> 01:46:43,521
And every morning
when you woke up,

1159
01:46:43,589 --> 01:46:45,957
you'd still be Beatrix Kiddo.

1160
01:46:46,025 --> 01:46:49,427
Oh, you can take
the needle out.

1161
01:46:55,501 --> 01:46:57,836
Are you calling me a superhero?

1162
01:46:57,904 --> 01:47:00,038
I'm calling you a killer.

1163
01:47:00,106 --> 01:47:03,008
A natural-born killer.

1164
01:47:03,076 --> 01:47:06,712
You always have been,
and you always will be.

1165
01:47:06,780 --> 01:47:09,014
Moving to El Paso,

1166
01:47:09,082 --> 01:47:12,551
working in
a used-record store,

1167
01:47:12,619 --> 01:47:16,755
goin' to the movies with Tommy,
clipping coupons.

1168
01:47:16,823 --> 01:47:18,624
That's you

1169
01:47:18,692 --> 01:47:22,260
trying to disguise yourself
as a worker bee.

1170
01:47:22,328 --> 01:47:25,297
That's you tryin'
to blend in with the hive.

1171
01:47:25,365 --> 01:47:28,666
But you're not a worker bee.

1172
01:47:28,734 --> 01:47:31,502
You're a renegade killer bee.

1173
01:47:31,570 --> 01:47:34,372
And no matter how much beer
you drank or barbecue you ate

1174
01:47:34,439 --> 01:47:37,741
or how fat your ass got,

1175
01:47:37,809 --> 01:47:41,712
nothing in the world
would ever change that.

1176
01:47:44,115 --> 01:47:46,316
First question:

1177
01:47:48,419 --> 01:47:53,789
did you really think your life
in El Paso was gonna work?

1178
01:47:59,463 --> 01:48:01,531
No!

1179
01:48:04,668 --> 01:48:07,603
But I would've had B.B.!

1180
01:48:07,671 --> 01:48:10,406
Don't get me wrong.

1181
01:48:10,474 --> 01:48:14,377
I think you would have been
a wonderful mother.

1182
01:48:14,444 --> 01:48:17,080
But you are a killer.

1183
01:48:21,118 --> 01:48:23,986
All those people you killed
to get to me

1184
01:48:24,054 --> 01:48:26,455
felt damn good, didn't they?

1185
01:48:28,592 --> 01:48:31,060
Yes.

1186
01:48:31,128 --> 01:48:33,730
Every single one of them?

1187
01:48:43,676 --> 01:48:46,578
Yes.

1188
01:48:48,815 --> 01:48:51,417
That was the warmup round.

1189
01:48:51,484 --> 01:48:56,922
Now comes the $64,000 question.

1190
01:49:03,529 --> 01:49:07,131
Why did you run away from me
with my baby?

1191
01:49:10,937 --> 01:49:14,339
Do you remember the last
assignment you sent me on?

1192
01:49:14,406 --> 01:49:16,875
Of course.

1193
01:49:16,943 --> 01:49:20,245
Lisa Wong.

1194
01:49:20,313 --> 01:49:24,483
The morning I left, I was sick.

1195
01:49:24,551 --> 01:49:28,954
On the plane, I threw up.

1196
01:49:29,022 --> 01:49:32,891
So I started thinking

1197
01:49:32,958 --> 01:49:35,093
maybe I was pregnant.

1198
01:49:35,160 --> 01:49:36,927
"Easy to use.

1199
01:49:36,995 --> 01:49:39,663
Remove cap and urinate
on the absorbent end for five seconds."

1200
01:49:41,766 --> 01:49:44,301
"Accurate results
in only 90 seconds."

1201
01:49:44,368 --> 01:49:47,938
"You can read the results
as soon as the line appears in the window."

1204
01:50:24,277 --> 01:50:25,377
Fuck.

1205

BEATRIX: What I didn't know

1206
01:50:27,613 --> 01:50:29,548
was that somewhere
on my journey

1207
01:50:29,615 --> 01:50:31,783
I had been spotted.

1208
01:50:31,851 --> 01:50:35,320
With me in L.A.,
it didn't take Lisa Wong long

1209
01:50:35,387 --> 01:50:37,821
to send an assassin of her own.

1210
01:50:37,889 --> 01:50:40,791
(DOORBELL DINGS)
BEATRIX: Hello, can I help you?

1211
01:50:40,859 --> 01:50:43,627
Hello, I'm Karen Kim.
I'm the hospitality manager of the hotel.

1212
01:50:43,695 --> 01:50:46,096
I have a welcome gift
from the management.

1213
01:50:46,163 --> 01:50:49,132
Oh, that's nice. Um...

1214
01:50:49,199 --> 01:50:51,367
Can you just leave it
by the door?

1215
01:51:03,745 --> 01:51:05,112
You pretty good
with that shotgun?

1216
01:51:05,180 --> 01:51:07,114
Not that I have to be
at this range,

1217
01:51:07,182 --> 01:51:08,949
but I'm a fuckin' surgeon
with this shotgun.

1218
01:51:09,017 --> 01:51:11,819
Well, guess what, bitch.
I'm better than Annie Oakley,

1219
01:51:11,886 --> 01:51:13,687
and I got you
right in my sight.

1220
01:51:13,755 --> 01:51:15,656
I could blow
your fuckin' head off.

1221
01:51:15,724 --> 01:51:19,794
Not before I put one
right between your eyes, so let's talk.

1222
01:51:21,397 --> 01:51:23,831
Karen...

1223
01:51:25,534 --> 01:51:27,869
I just found out

1224
01:51:27,937 --> 01:51:29,905
right now

1225
01:51:29,972 --> 01:51:36,045
not a moment before you blew
a hole through the door

1226
01:51:36,113 --> 01:51:40,316
that I'm pregnant.
What is this?

1227
01:51:40,384 --> 01:51:43,287
On the floor by the door

1228
01:51:43,354 --> 01:51:46,456
is a strip that says
I'm pregnant.

1229
01:51:46,524 --> 01:51:48,992
Bullshit.

1230
01:51:49,060 --> 01:51:52,629
Any other time
you'd be 100 percent right.

1231
01:51:52,697 --> 01:51:55,799
This time

1232
01:51:55,867 --> 01:51:58,736
you're 100 percent wrong.

1233
01:52:00,171 --> 01:52:03,807
I'm the deadliest woman
in the world.

1234
01:52:03,875 --> 01:52:06,143
But right now

1235
01:52:06,211 --> 01:52:09,580
I'm just scared shitless
for my baby.

1236
01:52:09,648 --> 01:52:12,383
Please.

1237
01:52:12,450 --> 01:52:14,918
Just look at the strip.

1238
01:52:16,955 --> 01:52:18,722
Please!

1239
01:52:20,058 --> 01:52:24,495
Stay where you are
and don't move.

1240
01:52:42,014 --> 01:52:44,215
I don't know what
this fuckin' shit means.

1241
01:52:44,283 --> 01:52:46,684
The box with the directions
it's right there.

1242

"Easy to use."

01:53:00,265 --> 01:53:04,803
"Remove the cap and urinate
on the absorbent end."

1244
01:53:04,870 --> 01:53:06,504
Blue means pregnant.

1245
01:53:06,572 --> 01:53:09,841
I'll read it myself,
thank you.

1246
01:53:16,215 --> 01:53:20,818
Oh, OK. Say I were
to believe you. What then?

1247
01:53:20,886 --> 01:53:23,454
Just go home.

1248
01:53:25,357 --> 01:53:27,425
I'll do the same.

1249
01:53:32,231 --> 01:53:34,466
(OPENS DOOR)

1250
01:53:47,012 --> 01:53:48,646
Congratulations.

1251
01:53:52,284 --> 01:53:55,085
Before that strip turned blue

1252
01:53:55,153 --> 01:53:58,589
I was a woman. I was your woman.

1253
01:53:58,657 --> 01:54:02,059
I was a killer
who killed for you.

1254
01:54:02,127 --> 01:54:03,861
Before that strip turned blue,

1255
01:54:03,929 --> 01:54:08,432
I would've jumped a motorcycle
onto a speeding train.

1256
01:54:08,500 --> 01:54:11,736
For you.

1257
01:54:11,804 --> 01:54:15,172
But once that strip turned blue

1258
01:54:15,240 --> 01:54:18,743
I could no longer
do any of those things.

1259
01:54:18,811 --> 01:54:21,279
Not anymore.

1260
01:54:21,347 --> 01:54:24,816
Because I was gonna be a mother.

1261
01:54:27,019 --> 01:54:29,888
Can you understand that?

1262
01:54:31,991 --> 01:54:34,693
Yes.

1263
01:54:34,761 --> 01:54:40,032
But why didn't you tell me then,
instead of now?

1264
01:54:40,099 --> 01:54:42,467
Once you knew, you'd claim her.

1265
01:54:42,535 --> 01:54:44,436
And I didn't want that.

1266
01:54:44,504 --> 01:54:47,506
Not your decision to make.

1267
01:54:47,574 --> 01:54:49,808
Yes.

1268
01:54:49,876 --> 01:54:54,046
But it's the right decision,
and I made it for my daughter.

1269
01:54:54,114 --> 01:54:58,851
She deserved to be born
with a clean slate.

1270
01:54:58,919 --> 01:55:02,155
But with you
she would've been born

1271
01:55:02,223 --> 01:55:05,091
into a world she shouldn't have.

1272
01:55:06,560 --> 01:55:09,729
I had to choose.

1273
01:55:09,797 --> 01:55:11,864
I chose her.

1274
01:55:14,368 --> 01:55:17,170
You know, five years ago,

1275
01:55:17,237 --> 01:55:20,106
if I had to make a list
of impossible things

1276
01:55:20,173 --> 01:55:22,141
that could never happen,

1277
01:55:22,209 --> 01:55:24,310
you performing
a coup de grâce on me

1278
01:55:24,377 --> 01:55:27,746
by bustin' a cap in my crown

1279
01:55:30,317 --> 01:55:33,118
would've been right
at the top of the list.

1280
01:55:34,687 --> 01:55:37,890
I'd have been wrong,
wouldn't I?

1281
01:55:37,958 --> 01:55:39,825
I'm sorry.

1282
01:55:39,893 --> 01:55:43,195
Was that a question?

1283
01:55:43,263 --> 01:55:45,964
Of impossible things
that could never happen,

1284
01:55:46,032 --> 01:55:50,168
yes, in this instance,
you would've been wrong.

1285
01:55:50,236 --> 01:55:52,136
Well?

1286
01:55:52,204 --> 01:55:54,839
When you never came back,

1287
01:55:54,906 --> 01:55:58,075
I naturally assumed Lisa Wong,

1288
01:55:58,143 --> 01:56:01,079

letting somebody think
somebody they love is dead

1291

when they're not
is quite cruel.

And in the third month

to some fucking jerk.

You overreacted?
Is that your explanation?

I didn't say I was
gonna explain myself.

tell you the truth.
