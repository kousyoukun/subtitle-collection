真的想 If only

00:00:52,894 --> 00:00:54,759
我可以找到 I could find

10
00:00:54,963 --> 00:00:56,760
无论是活的还是死的 alive or dead

11
00:00:56,965 --> 00:00:58,694
一个男人或者一具尸体 A man, a body

或者是动物 An animal

13
00:01:00,902 --> 00:01:02,597
我不介意 I don't mind

14
00:01:02,804 --> 00:01:05,272
这是做梦 Just to dream

15
00:01:06,208 --> 00:01:07,869

白天和黑夜 Both day and night

20
00:01:17,352 --> 00:01:19,445
我真是无聊 I get so bored

21
00:01:19,588 --> 00:01:21,146
我真的想 If only

22
00:01:21,356 --> 00:01:23,119
可以找到 I could find

23
00:01:23,358 --> 00:01:24,916
一个男人或女人 Man or woman

24
00:01:25,127 --> 00:01:26,719

一个凶手 A werewolf

26
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:30,625
我也不介意 I couldn't care less

27
00:01:30,832 --> 00:01:33,300
只是在做梦 Just to dream.

28
00:01:36,738 --> 00:01:40,333
当你爱上一个男孩你会 想方设法尽快得到他 When you fall for a boy, you try to pin him down too soon.

29
00:01:40,542 --> 00:01:43,306
三天之后他就想溜走想自由 After three days, he wants to kick his way free

30
00:01:43,945 --> 00:01:46,140
有多远走多远 and get as far away as he can.

31
00:01:46,281 --> 00:01:51,275
哦 真的吗 那我们看看谁能 先找到一个正派的男孩吧 Oh, yeah? So let's see who can pick up a decent boy first.

32
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:53,980
我很大方，甚至不必 一定要是正派的男孩 I'll be generous. Doesn't even have to be decent.

33
00:01:54,156 --> 00:01:55,555
任何男孩 Any boy.

34
00:01:55,724 --> 00:01:57,123
即使像你一样的肥胖懒汉 Even a fat slob like you.

35
00:01:57,292 --> 00:01:59,385
好像哑巴一样 That shows how dumb you are.

36
00:01:59,528 --> 00:02:01,553
你身体强壮 You're great physically,

37
00:02:01,696 --> 00:02:04,426
但当他们了解你了 他们会跑得老远的 but once they get to know you, they run a mile.

38
00:02:04,633 --> 00:02:06,726
甚至还没了解你就跑了 They run before even getting to know you!

39
00:02:06,868 --> 00:02:08,460
我只是还太年轻 I'm just too young.

40
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:10,365
他们怕跟我睡 They'd be scared to sleep with me.

41
00:02:10,572 --> 00:02:13,700
但你道德沦丧 But you reek of loose morals.

42
00:02:13,842 --> 00:02:15,241
我不会在外过夜的 I don't sleep around.

43
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:17,002
这个是你唯一不做的事 That's the only thing you don't do.

44
00:02:17,913 --> 00:02:20,711
你对不在外面过夜 的理解很怪诞 You have a weird notion of what "not sleeping around" means.

45
00:02:20,916 --> 00:02:22,611
这是事实你知道吗 That's what matters, you know.

46
00:02:23,752 --> 00:02:25,344
我不这样认为 I don't think so.

47
00:02:25,554 --> 00:02:28,819
如果我找到我爱的人 我就会打破这个原则 If I meet a man I love, I'd want to be broken in.

48
00:02:28,957 --> 00:02:32,051
他不会在意我的第一次 He won't think my first time counts.

49
00:02:32,194 --> 00:02:34,890
第一次不应该给任何人 The first time should be with nobody.

50
00:02:35,096 --> 00:02:37,656
我不想那个男的说 得到了我的第一次 I don't want a guy bragging he had me first.

51
00:02:37,833 --> 00:02:39,232
男人都有病 Guys are all sick.

52
00:03:10,232 --> 00:03:11,790
我累了 I'm wiped out.

53
00:03:11,967 --> 00:03:15,164
来吧 我想你是渴了 - Oh, come on! - I thought you wanted a drink.

54
00:03:18,173 --> 00:03:20,073
哪里简直就是垃圾堆 That place is a dump.

55
00:03:57,812 --> 00:04:00,508
你愿意就坐这里吧 You can sit here if you like.

56
00:04:01,716 --> 00:04:04,184
告诉你的朋友 我的姐妹 Tell your friend -- - My sister.

57
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:08,252
你不能只是坐下 还要问别人是否介意 You can't just sit down. You ask if people mind.

58
00:04:10,325 --> 00:04:14,022
我不介意 我也问过你的 I don't mind. I asked you to.

59
00:04:16,164 --> 00:04:17,722
来吧 Go ahead.

60
00:04:21,369 --> 00:04:22,927
你真好 It's very kind of you.

61
00:04:23,104 --> 00:04:26,665
当没有座位 你感到渴和累的时候 When there's no seats free and you're thirsty and tired,

62
00:04:28,143 --> 00:04:30,304
有一个这么友好的人真是太好了 It's nice to find someone friendly.

63
00:04:30,445 --> 00:04:32,436

65
00:04:36,051 --> 00:04:37,951
别站在这里 你都冻坏了 Don't just stand there, you lump.

66
00:04:56,204 --> 00:04:58,069

香蕉半剖条我最喜欢的 A banana split -- my favorite.

70
00:05:22,631 --> 00:05:26,397
我们来这里度假 住在当地人家里 We're on vacation here, staying at the Residence.

71
00:05:27,268 --> 00:05:28,997
很安静 但 It's nice because it's quiet but.

72
00:05:29,671 --> 00:05:31,229
我们出入不方便 we can't get out easily.

73
00:05:33,742 --> 00:05:35,937
我们觉得 We're not allowed.

74
00:05:36,077 --> 00:05:37,635
不自然 Speak for yourself.

75
00:05:39,614 --> 00:05:41,172
别担心 Don't worry.

76
00:05:41,349 --> 00:05:43,783
他不明白你刚才说的那个词 He can't understand a word you're saying.

77
00:05:44,853 --> 00:05:46,411
他只是很有礼貌 He's just being polite.

78
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:50,648
不这样不错 No, it's okay.

79
00:05:50,825 --> 00:05:52,884
但你能不能说话慢点呢 But can you speak more slowly?

80
00:05:53,028 --> 00:05:55,292

83
00:06:09,144 --> 00:06:12,238
我也不知道以后要做什么 但很快就会看到的了 I don't know what I'm gonna do later, but it's handy, see.

84
00:06:12,814 --> 00:06:15,214

89
00:06:31,766 --> 00:06:33,597
这是个问题 That's the problem.

90
00:06:33,802 --> 00:06:36,362
你可以不去上课 You're not required to attend classes,

91

92

你经常要在6月参加补考 如果老不及格 You can always retake them in June, but if you keep falling behind.

93
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:48,172
还有我爸爸就是不理解 Besides, my father wouldn't understand.

94

这床会摇动的 我很怕 The bed was shaking. I was terrified.

105
00:08:57,812 --> 00:09:00,576
但我没有下楼找安全地方 But I didn't come downstairs to safety.

106
00:09:00,815 --> 00:09:03,045
我用被单蒙头 I pulled the sheets over my head

107
00:09:03,184 --> 00:09:04,742
我决心 and decided

108
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:07,945
要忘记那些声音继续入睡 to ignore the noise and go back to sleep.

109
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:11,957
我一定是疯了 睡觉救不了我 I must have been crazy. Sleeping wouldn't save me.

是的 我对刑法很感兴趣 Yes, that's what interests me.

114
00:09:24,973 --> 00:09:28,465
我想它会更有用 I think it's much more useful.

115
00:09:28,643 --> 00:09:32,443
当然我也是学国际法的 Of course, I'll study international law too

116
00:09:32,647 --> 00:09:34,444
要做个商业律师 to be a business lawyer.

117
00:09:34,649 --> 00:09:38,483
但是我工作是想过好日子 But I'd like to start out working for good causes.

118
00:09:38,686 --> 00:09:40,244
那你是学国际法 So you'll be in international law.

119
00:09:40,421 --> 00:09:42,514
我父亲也很看重的 My father insists on it.

120
00:09:42,657 --> 00:09:46,252
我父亲也是国际法律师当然 He's an international lawyer and so, of course,

121
00:09:46,427 --> 00:09:49,089
他也想我学国际法 he'd like me to follow in his footsteps.

122
00:09:50,164 --> 00:09:52,189
你了解国际法吗 Have you gotten acquainted?

123
00:09:52,934 --> 00:09:55,334
能应付得来吗是的 我学得很好 Is this okay for you? - Yes, perfect.

124
00:09:55,503 --> 00:09:57,767
我叫他节食 I'm putting him on a diet.

125
00:09:57,906 --> 00:09:59,771
你觉得我肥 You think I'm fat.

126
00:09:59,974 --> 00:10:02,238
不是 但在你这个年龄你的身材不是苗条 No, but you're not thin for your age.

127
00:10:07,348 --> 00:10:10,442
你真的吃饱了吗 我看都吃光了 - Sure you've got enough? - I was worried it'd all be gone.

128
00:10:11,886 --> 00:10:14,286
别人还说她怎么会肥 And people wonder why she's fat.

129
00:10:14,455 --> 00:10:17,913
其实很简单她吃得像头猪 这都是她自己造成的 It's simple: She eats like a pig. It's all she does.

130
00:10:18,092 --> 00:10:22,256
不是她的错是激素的错 It's not her fault -- it's hormonal. She can't help it.

131
00:10:23,531 --> 00:10:25,624
也许是这样 但她不停地塞东西入口 Maybe so, but she keeps stuffing herself.

132
00:10:25,767 --> 00:10:27,997
让我没有食欲 哦得了 It ruins my appetite. - Oh, come on.

00:11:18,419 --> 00:11:21,286
我的嘴唇很柔软是吧我是个接吻好手 My lips are soft, huh? I'm a good kisser.

146
00:11:24,092 --> 00:11:26,219
是的你是我的爱人 Yes, you're my love,

147
00:11:26,361 --> 00:11:28,761
但是我不想和你结婚 but I don't want to marry you yet.

148
00:11:35,603 --> 00:11:38,003
既然我了解我这样的男人 Now that I know men like me,

149
00:11:39,273 --> 00:11:41,503
我想要些其他经历 I want other experiences.

150
00:11:42,744 --> 00:11:46,578
我吻得好不好啊我以前只是吻过一次而已 Don't I kiss well? I've only been kissed once before.

151
00:11:55,289 --> 00:11:59,157
你妒忌吗我没有骗你 Are you jealous? I didn't really cheat on you.

152
00:12:00,361 --> 00:12:02,454
你知道女人不是肥皂泡 Women aren't like bars of soap, you know.

153
00:12:03,364 --> 00:12:05,127
她们不会破灭 They don't wear away.

154
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:10,362
相反每个爱人会让她更丰富 On the contrary, each lover brings them more,

155
00:12:10,505 --> 00:12:12,769
你会得到所有的好处 and you get all the benefit.

156
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:20,441
你让我觉得很恶心啊你怎么能让 我那么讨厌你又那么吸引我啊 You make me sick. How can you disgust me and attract me so much?

157
00:12:22,083 --> 00:12:25,712
你是我付出所有的一个 You're the one I'll give it all to.

158
00:12:26,354 --> 00:12:29,653
不我以前从来没有跟人睡过 No, I've never slept with anyone before.

159
00:12:50,611 --> 00:12:53,171
你在做什么啊 What are you doing? Can't you ask?

160
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:08,179
你在做什么啊忘记 - What are you doing? - Get lost.

161
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:12,187
出去吗 不不是我怎么可以呢 - Going out? - No, I'm not. How the hell can I?

162
00:14:13,761 --> 00:14:15,991
你没有请他来这里是吗 You didn't invite him here, did you?

163
00:14:16,964 --> 00:14:18,522
去睡觉 Go to sleep.

164
00:14:19,133 --> 00:14:21,693
你什么都没听到什么都 没看到什么都不知道 You hear nothing, see nothing and know nothing.

165
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:25,030
如果你要睡觉就不用化妆 No need for makeup If you're going to sleep.

166
00:14:27,008 --> 00:14:28,566
睡觉吧好吗 Go to sleep, okay?

167
00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:32,377
记住别多管闲事 And remember, mind your own business.

168
00:14:56,470 --> 00:14:58,028
你找对地方了 You got the right place.

169
00:14:58,973 --> 00:15:01,237
你说是左边第一道门 You said the first door on the left.

170
00:15:03,177 --> 00:15:04,940
我妹妹睡了 My little sister's asleep.

171
00:15:10,017 --> 00:15:14,420
门卫差点不让我进来 The gateman almost didn't let me in.

172
00:15:14,589 --> 00:15:18,150
那你怎么进来的我给他小费了 - How did you manage? - I gave him a tip.

173
00:15:35,009 --> 00:15:36,704
来点音乐吧 Let's put on some music.

174
00:15:36,911 --> 00:15:38,310
不行 We can't.

175
00:15:38,813 --> 00:15:41,680
又不是什么大事 那什么是大事啊 It's no big deal. - What's a big deal?

176
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:44,208
那就是好像 It's as if.

177
00:15:44,986 --> 00:15:47,250
音乐比我更重要一样 the music counted more than I do.

178
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:50,685
对你来说 As if it meant more to you.

179
00:15:51,859 --> 00:15:53,451
我会被侵犯 I could get offended.

180
00:15:54,228 --> 00:15:56,287
什么没什么 - What? - Nothing.

181
00:16:05,039 --> 00:16:08,133
对不起我的法语说得不好 I'm sorry I don't speak French well.

182
00:16:08,976 --> 00:16:12,002
我不想告诉你 I'd like to tell you all kinds of things.

183
00:16:12,747 --> 00:16:15,181
你是那么的动人 That you're so pretty.

184
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:20,912
我知道双方不理解是很辛苦的 I know. It's hard not being able to understand each other.

185
00:16:22,189 --> 00:16:26,990
好像我说意大利语的 却说西班牙语一样 To think I could have taken Italian but chose Spanish instead.

186
00:16:27,194 --> 00:16:28,286
他们很有男子气概 They're machos.

187
00:16:32,066 --> 00:16:34,466
我明年要苦修意大利语 I can try to learn Italian next year.

188
00:16:34,635 --> 00:16:36,830
不应该是我去学法语 No, I have to learn French.

189
00:16:37,571 --> 00:16:38,970
我不知道为什么 I don't see why.

190
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:43,770
当我到巴黎看你时 我的法语一定学得更好 When I come to see you in Paris, I'll have learnt French better.

191
00:16:43,978 --> 00:16:46,139
你会来巴黎看我吗 我会 - You'll come to see me in Paris? - Yes.

192
00:16:48,382 --> 00:16:50,942
其实我不是住在巴黎 I don't actually live in Paris.

193
00:16:52,386 --> 00:16:54,081
我住在巴黎外面 I live just outside.

194
00:16:54,889 --> 00:16:56,447
虽然我有很大的房子 I have a great house, though.

195
00:16:57,158 --> 00:17:00,025
那行我会去的 That's okay, I'll be coming anyway.

196
00:17:09,937 --> 00:17:11,928
你上床也带乳罩的吗 You wear your bra to bed?

197
00:17:13,074 --> 00:17:15,235
不是我忘了脱而已 No, I forgot to take it off.

198
00:17:35,629 --> 00:17:37,290
你能帮我吗 Can't you help me?

199
00:17:37,498 --> 00:17:38,897
男孩总要干活 A boy has to work.

200
00:17:40,668 --> 00:17:43,068
如果太容易得到了那就没意思了 If it's too easy, there's no pleasure.

201
00:17:44,238 --> 00:17:48,937
别担心这些不是那么简单的 Don't worry. These things are always so complicated.

202
00:17:50,644 --> 00:17:52,043
真的吗 Is that true?

203
00:17:55,483 --> 00:17:58,179
你以前有很多女孩子吗 我不是第一个 You've loved a lot of girls before? I'm not the first.

204
00:17:59,987 --> 00:18:02,387
当然你不是 Of course, you're not the first.

205
00:18:03,157 --> 00:18:07,025
我知道我只是问问你 有很多很多的女人 I realize that. I'm just asking If you've had lots and lots of girls.

206
00:18:09,363 --> 00:18:10,887
那又有什么关系 What does it matter?

207
00:18:13,367 --> 00:18:15,733
重要的是我现在和你一起 I'm here with you now.

208
00:18:18,672 --> 00:18:20,537
但是有多少个啊 But how many have you had?

209
00:18:21,375 --> 00:18:23,935
不是很多 那有多少啊 - Not that many. - How many?

210
00:18:24,945 --> 00:18:26,344
我不知道 I don't know.

211
00:18:26,947 --> 00:18:29,211
如果你不知道那就是非常多了 If you don't know, that means loads.

212
00:18:30,117 --> 00:18:31,812
你妒忌了 You're jealous.

213
00:18:33,621 --> 00:18:35,316
我从来没遇到像你一样的 I've never had one like you.

214
00:18:36,123 --> 00:18:37,681
真的吗 Are you sure?

215
00:18:40,394 --> 00:18:43,261
即使不是我和你睡 也会有其他的人吧 Even if I don't sleep with you and others do?

216
00:19:01,882 --> 00:19:03,975
那可不一样 That makes a big difference.

217
00:19:15,229 --> 00:19:19,290
我对处女没兴趣 I haven't been interested in a virgin since.

218
00:19:19,633 --> 00:19:21,066
什么时候开始 Since?

219
00:19:21,235 --> 00:19:23,066
我15岁时 Since I was 15.

220
00:19:25,439 --> 00:19:29,000
其他的女孩都是第一次见面 就跟你睡的吗 The other girls all slept with you on the first date?

221
00:19:31,278 --> 00:19:33,678
第一次或第二次都一样 first or second, it's the same.

222
00:19:33,848 --> 00:19:35,440
不不一样 No, it's not the same.

223
00:19:38,252 --> 00:19:41,551
你可以说都是他们自愿的 You can tell it's all they want.

224
00:19:42,623 --> 00:19:45,490
有时候吧 这让我很不舒服 Sometimes, it's so obvious It makes me sick.

225
00:19:46,961 --> 00:19:49,657
就是自从那次 There was this one once.

226
00:19:50,798 --> 00:19:54,165
她约我吃饭然后带我到她的房间 She asked me to dinner and took me to her bedroom.

227
00:19:54,335 --> 00:19:55,734
你进入我身体了 You're in mine now.

228
00:19:55,903 --> 00:19:57,598
这很不同 This is different.

229
00:19:58,072 --> 00:20:01,633
而且我们没有选择 We have no choice. Anyway.

230
00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:07,272
有人告诉我她想跟我出去 someone told me that this girl had wanted to go out with me

231
00:20:07,481 --> 00:20:10,973
从那年年初就想了我没有注意到 Since the start of the year, but I hadn't noticed.

232
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:15,820
所以她就约我吃饭 然后去了她的房间 So she asks me to dinner, and we go to her room.

233
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:20,993
开始喝酒喝了四瓶 And there we start drinking. There were four bottles of wine,

234
00:20:21,161 --> 00:20:23,391
就是这样好像刚好四瓶 just like that, as if by chance. Four of them.

235
00:20:24,131 --> 00:20:26,691
我们就开始喝酒什么都没吃 So we start drinking and eat nothing.

236
00:20:27,301 --> 00:20:30,600
我在想你不可能赢我的母狗 I'm thinking, "You won't get me, bitch."

237
00:20:30,738 --> 00:20:34,265
我的意思是说女的喝酒 绝对没有男的厉害 I mean, a girl can't take as much drink as a guy.

238
00:20:34,875 --> 00:20:38,436
所以我喝酒速度就减慢了 So I slow down on my drinking

239
00:20:38,612 --> 00:20:40,375
不停的给她倒酒 and keep on filling her glass.

240
00:20:41,015 --> 00:20:45,816
到了半夜我跟她说对不起 At half past midnight, I tell her, "Sorry.

241
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:49,683
我就要赶不上末班火车了晚安 Got to go. I'll miss the last tram. Good night."

242
00:20:49,890 --> 00:20:54,293
我扔下烂醉如泥的她 她对我非常生气 I left her blind drunk and mad at me.

243
00:20:54,461 --> 00:20:56,554
再也没有跟我说话 She hasn't spoken to me since.

244
00:20:56,697 --> 00:20:58,688
你不喜欢她吗 You didn't like her?

245
00:20:58,832 --> 00:21:00,527
她是很可爱的那种女孩子 She was kind of cute.

246
00:21:00,734 --> 00:21:03,532
但我就是这样踢走她的 But I got a kick out of dumping her like that.

247
00:21:07,341 --> 00:21:09,502
还有她不是唯一一个 Besides, she wasn't the only one.

248
00:21:09,643 --> 00:21:12,134
我这样对待的人 I've done it loads of times.

249
00:21:15,082 --> 00:21:16,777
跟女孩子在一起是那么的容易 It's so easy with girls.

250
00:21:20,054 --> 00:21:23,251
你喜欢过跟你睡过的女孩子吗 Were you in love with the others you've slept with?

251
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:28,291
我知道你想什么你在妒忌 I know what you're getting at. You're jealous.

252
00:21:28,896 --> 00:21:31,296
其它的不算 The others don't count.

253
00:21:32,733 --> 00:21:35,930
我跟他们睡只是因为我是男人 I only sleep with them because I'm a guy. That's all.

254
00:21:38,105 --> 00:21:40,403
所以如果你跟我睡 So if you slept with me,

255
00:21:40,574 --> 00:21:42,769
我会跟其他的女孩子一样嘛 I'd be like all the other girls?

256
00:21:44,945 --> 00:21:45,809
不会 No.

257
00:21:49,717 --> 00:21:51,878
我尊重你 I'd respect you.

258
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:54,451
甚至你和我睡觉嘛 Even if you slept with me?

259
00:21:57,124 --> 00:21:57,818
是的 Yes.

260
00:22:39,433 --> 00:22:41,230
发誓你不想做 Promise you won't do it.

261
00:22:42,636 --> 00:22:44,263
我不想你做 I don't want you to.

262
00:22:44,471 --> 00:22:46,268
我以我妈妈的头发誓 I swear on my mother's head

263
00:22:46,907 --> 00:22:48,306
我会适可而止的 I'll stay on the edge.

264
00:22:49,743 --> 00:22:51,438
在不介意的边缘 On the edge doesn't count.

265
00:22:52,246 --> 00:22:53,645
真的吗 不会的 - It does. - It doesn't.

266
00:22:53,814 --> 00:22:55,509
会的 It does.

267
00:22:55,716 --> 00:22:57,274
因为我介意 Because I count.

268
00:22:57,885 --> 00:23:00,285
你是唯一一个介意的人 You're the only one who counts.

269
00:23:14,968 --> 00:23:17,232
我怕到时候你控制不住 I'm scared you won't be able to hold back.

270
00:23:17,371 --> 00:23:19,635
别担心这个这是我的问题 Don't worry about that. That's my problem.

271
00:23:20,374 --> 00:23:24,208
我是个男人我知道是 否能做到 我可以的 I'm a man. I know if I can hold back or not. And I can.

272
00:23:28,148 --> 00:23:30,878
但我像完全的拥有你 But I'd like to have you properly.

273
00:23:31,085 --> 00:23:32,882
这不可能 That's not possible.

274
00:23:34,822 --> 00:23:39,225
如果我跟其他我不爱的女人 一起那真的是无法忍受的 It's dumb if I have to go with another girl, a girl I don't love.

275
00:23:44,698 --> 00:23:46,222
你想吗 Will you need to?

276
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,095
你看我不想 Look, I don't want

277
00:23:48,302 --> 00:23:53,001
但我不能 to bring myself off on my own in the can. That's sick.

278
00:24:07,187 --> 00:24:08,745
我爱你 I love you.

279
00:24:10,257 --> 00:24:12,953
我真的爱你 但请你给我时间 I really love you. But give me time.

280
00:24:43,557 --> 00:24:45,821
我说了我不想 I said I don't want to.

281
00:24:49,229 --> 00:24:50,787
我什么都不做 I didn't do anything.

282
00:24:51,465 --> 00:24:54,866
我还以为你也想的我什么都没做 I thought you wanted it too. I didn't do anything.

283
00:25:07,414 --> 00:25:09,814
你把这一切都破坏了知道吗 You're spoiling everything, understand?

284
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:14,012
是你破坏的 You're spoiling it.

285
00:25:14,154 --> 00:25:16,247
这很好啊 It was fine.

286
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:19,484
是的是很好 你不觉得很好吗 Yes, it was fine. Don't you realize it was fine?

287
00:25:47,287 --> 00:25:48,686
我不觉得 I can't.

288
00:25:51,458 --> 00:25:54,859
这是我的错我不能这样太快了 It's not my fault. I can't. Not like this, straight off.

289
00:26:08,909 --> 00:26:10,604
我不是骗你 I didn't trick you.

290
00:26:15,582 --> 00:26:17,140
我警告你 I warned you.

291

她可能是假睡你不了解她 She might be pretending. You don't know her.

356
00:34:52,732 --> 00:34:54,324
她妒忌 She's jealous.

357
00:34:54,968 --> 00:34:57,528
你接受不了我比她大 She won't accept that I'm older than her.

是以为我的姐姐吗 不不是她 - Because of my sister? - No, it's not her.

372

相爱中的人都是这样 What should be natural between two people in love is so --

373

如果你说不想 我就去死 If you'd said no, I'd have died.

382
00:37:27,587 --> 00:37:30,283
我将是你第一个爱人 I'll be your first lover.

你还不到16岁这太危险了 It's too dangerous. You're not 16.

398
00:38:50,003 --> 00:38:52,267
这不公平 是我想要的 That's not fair. It's me who wants it.

399
00:39:07,954 --> 00:39:10,354
看 不是我想住手的 See, it wasn't me who stopped first.

你觉得开公司容易吗 You think it's easy to start up a company?

411
00:40:13,352 --> 00:40:17,618
万事开头难 Everything's so sluggish at first before it takes off.

412
00:40:17,757 --> 00:40:19,554

我刚才生气了不是你的错 I've just got a temper. It's not your fault.

423

我不想做你的妻子 I'm sick of being your ball and chain.

424
00:41:30,663 --> 00:41:32,062
你不是我的妻子 You're not my ball and chain.

433
00:42:06,599 --> 00:42:09,159
她有什么问题吗 没有 - What's wrong with her? - Nothing.

434

事实上我没有度假 我是唯一不会生气的人 In fact, I can't take a vacation, and I'm the only one not sulking!

437
00:42:27,587 --> 00:42:28,986
看看你说的 Look at you all!

438
00:42:29,922 --> 00:42:33,983
很希望你高兴 谢谢主 我明天要走了 I'm glad you're so happy. Thank God I'm leaving tomorrow.

439
00:42:34,126 --> 00:42:36,993
你怎么啦 她怎么啦 What's wrong with you? What's wrong with her?

440
00:42:37,196 --> 00:42:39,460
她还是个少女可以 克服这一关的 It's adolescence. She'll get over it.

441
00:42:40,466 --> 00:42:42,559
她最好快点克服 She'd better get over it fast.

442
00:42:58,851 --> 00:43:02,082
不会那么严重的 你还没失去胃口 It can't be serious. You haven't lost your appetite.

443
00:43:09,028 --> 00:43:10,427
来吧吃吧 Come on, eat.

444
00:43:16,669 --> 00:43:18,364
吃对你有好处 It'll do you good.

445
00:43:20,339 --> 00:43:22,603
吃可以让你不去想起什么事 Eating takes your mind off things.

446
00:44:03,215 --> 00:44:05,649
聚会你差点忘记了 Franeois, you almost forgot this.

447
00:44:07,653 --> 00:44:09,211
如果他回来 If he's flying back --

448
00:44:09,388 --> 00:44:12,585
那是什么我们会坐车回家的 What of it? We'll go home by car.

449
00:44:13,726 --> 00:44:15,523
我会开车 I'll drive.

450
00:44:16,395 --> 00:44:20,661
累的时候就用高速路休息站 We'll use highway rest stops when I'm tired.

451
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:22,665
这样会更花更多时间 It'll just take longer.

452
00:44:22,868 --> 00:44:24,426
你会开车吗 You'll be driving?

453
00:44:26,038 --> 00:44:29,599
哦我可以的我只是不想 Oh, come on. I can do it. I just don't like to.

454
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:51,560
每年我都想 你爸爸还能坚持多久 Every year, I wonder how long your dad will last.

455
00:44:52,698 --> 00:44:54,598
他这次破了自己的纪录 He broke his record this time.

456
00:44:55,501 --> 00:44:57,059
他不能度假 He can't stand vacations.

457
00:44:57,236 --> 00:45:00,637
他也不能接受同伙度假 And he can't stand his partners being on vacation either.

458
00:45:01,974 --> 00:45:05,466
他会马上叫他们回来工作的 You'll see. He'll have them back at work in no time.

459
00:45:05,644 --> 00:45:07,509
我想我跟他不一样 I guess I'm not like him.

460
00:45:08,314 --> 00:45:10,373
我可以理解他 I understand him.

461
00:45:10,516 --> 00:45:12,108
度假充电 Vacations suck.

462
00:45:30,636 --> 00:45:32,194
不会再有了 Not again!

463
00:45:32,371 --> 00:45:35,272
你的衣服不一样的 You're not getting the exact same dress as me.

464
00:45:35,474 --> 00:45:37,339
你是不是不想和我搭配啊 Aren't you sick of copying me?

465
00:45:38,144 --> 00:45:39,941
想恢复到以前啊 Try to be original for once.

466
00:45:40,146 --> 00:45:41,545
态度完全不同的 It's a different color.

467
00:45:41,714 --> 00:45:43,272
是一样的衣服 It's the same dress.

468
00:45:44,050 --> 00:45:47,611
我一直都跟着你的 风格的现在是你学我的 I'm stuck with you all the time, and now you copy me.

469
00:45:47,787 --> 00:45:50,347
我不知道你穿了同一件 I didn't know you chose the same one.

470
00:45:50,523 --> 00:45:52,388
我觉得那是最好的一件 I think it's the best one too.

471
00:45:52,591 --> 00:45:54,991
你也可以拿走我的男朋友 You could take my boyfriend too

472
00:45:55,161 --> 00:45:58,153
再说 我根本不知道他就是你的 and say, "I didn't see he was already yours."

473
00:45:58,297 --> 00:46:00,094
他不是你的 他不是狗 He's not yours. He's not a dog.

474
00:46:00,299 --> 00:46:04,099
他是我的你 只是条母狗想要学我 He is mine. And you're just a bitch, trying to copy me.

475
00:46:04,303 --> 00:46:07,397
你没有机会了 永远都不会像我 You don't stand a chance. You'll never be like me.

476
00:46:07,540 --> 00:46:10,998
你一定是开玩笑 我不想跟你一样 You must be joking! I don't want to be like you.

477
00:46:11,777 --> 00:46:14,507
那好你最好什么都别学我的 Well you'd better not copy me in any case.

478
00:46:15,481 --> 00:46:18,541
我不觉得这是同一件 I didn't realize it was the same one.

479
00:46:34,533 --> 00:46:35,795
这个更短了 Shorter.

480
00:46:44,310 --> 00:46:45,709
我想要短些 I want it shorter.

481
00:46:45,878 --> 00:46:48,039
刚过膝盖 It's prettier below the knee.

482
00:46:49,615 --> 00:46:53,176
是我穿的我想要短些 I'm the one wearing it, and I want it shorter.

483
00:46:55,221 --> 00:46:56,620
让我来 Let me do it.

484
00:46:56,789 --> 00:46:59,349
真是个倔强的人 我跟她做不了什么 A real mule. I can't do a thing with her.

485
00:47:25,417 --> 00:47:27,248
我该离开这里 It's pretty creepy out here.

486
00:47:27,453 --> 00:47:30,547
我也觉得是最少 我觉得很不舒服 I think so, at least. I feel really uneasy.

487
00:47:32,358 --> 00:47:33,950
你错了外面很美好 You're wrong. It's great out here.

488
00:47:34,760 --> 00:47:36,557
你甚至看不到马路 You can't even see the road.

489
00:47:37,596 --> 00:47:40,292
我希望我们迷路了永远走不出来 I hope we lose our way and never get out,

490
00:47:40,933 --> 00:47:42,798
好像走进远古一样 like in an ancient legend.

491
00:47:43,002 --> 00:47:44,765
这个主意不错 Good idea.

492
00:48:29,481 --> 00:48:32,177
我决心要忘记路 I've set my heart to rot away

493
00:48:32,384 --> 00:48:36,218
在窗边 On the windowsill

494
00:48:36,689 --> 00:48:39,283
我相信将来 I trust in a future day

495
00:48:39,758 --> 00:48:42,625
乌鸦会过来 我相信它们会的 The crows may come I hope they will

496
00:48:42,828 --> 00:48:45,524
看到他们的嘴从天空飞过 with their beaks so fleet

497
00:48:45,731 --> 00:48:49,326
他们会 They will peck away

498
00:48:49,501 --> 00:48:52,368
吃掉一对生肉 At this lump of raw meat

499
00:48:52,571 --> 00:48:55,665
这就是你担心的 Over which you thought you held sway

500
00:48:55,808 --> 00:48:58,504
我决定要离去 I've set my heart to rot away

501
00:48:58,711 --> 00:49:02,807
窗台边 On the windowsill

502
00:49:02,948 --> 00:49:05,644
因为很不愉快的日子 For the joyless joy of the day

503
00:49:05,851 --> 00:49:08,718
我的担忧来了 My worries fall still

504
00:49:09,688 --> 00:49:12,486
如果你看到羊群 If you see the flock

505
00:49:12,691 --> 00:49:15,888
羊群跑过 Of crows fighting over it

506
00:49:16,028 --> 00:49:18,622
别用石头扔他们 Throw them not a rock

507
00:49:18,831 --> 00:49:22,028
因为我跟他们差不多 For I am worth not a bit

508
00:49:22,167 --> 00:49:24,692
我决心要离去 I've set my heart to rot away

509
00:49:24,870 --> 00:49:28,704
在窗台边 On the windowsill

510
00:49:28,907 --> 00:49:31,603
我相信在未来的日子里 I trust in a future day

511
00:49:31,810 --> 00:49:35,109
乌鸦来的时候如果它们能来到 When the crows come, if they will

512
00:49:35,281 --> 00:49:37,909
它们的嘴是那么的灵活 with their beaks so fleet

513
00:49:38,117 --> 00:49:41,518
它们会吃掉 They will peck away

514
00:49:41,687 --> 00:49:44,383
这一堆生肉 At this lump of raw meat

515
00:49:44,590 --> 00:49:47,753
这就是你担心的 Over which you thought you held sway

516
00:51:38,837 --> 00:51:40,236
荡妇 Slut.

517
00:51:58,524 --> 00:52:01,084
没人会相信我们是姐妹 No one would think we're sisters.

518
00:52:04,863 --> 00:52:08,128
真的我们根本不像的 It's true. We don't take after anyone.

519
00:52:14,072 --> 00:52:16,472
好像是不同的人的孩子 It's like we're born of ourselves.

520
00:52:17,576 --> 00:52:22,309
有趣的是 我们真的 没什么共同点 看你 It's funny. We really have nothing in common. Look at you.

521
00:52:24,783 --> 00:52:26,546
一双小的坚强的眼睛 You have small, hard eyes,

522
00:52:27,786 --> 00:52:29,617
而我的眼睛很朦胧 while mine are hazy.

523
00:52:33,091 --> 00:52:35,355
但我仔细看你的眼睛 But when I look deep into your eyes,

524
00:52:36,428 --> 00:52:38,828
让我觉得那是我属于我的 it makes me feel like I belong,

525
00:52:39,598 --> 00:52:41,725
好像是我的眼睛 as if they were my eyes.

526
00:52:44,636 --> 00:52:47,104
我也这样想 I feel the same thing.

527
00:52:48,474 --> 00:52:50,772
所以我们是姐妹 That's why we're sisters.

528
00:52:50,909 --> 00:52:54,174
当我恨你的时候我看这了 我就恨不起来 When I hate you, I look at you and then I can't.

529
00:52:56,448 --> 00:52:59,508
就好像要恨我自己一样 It's like hating part of myself.

530
00:53:00,252 --> 00:53:03,585
所以才那么讨厌你 That's why I loathe you so violently,

531
00:53:05,190 --> 00:53:07,886
因为你本来应该跟我一样的 because you ought to be like me.

532
00:53:08,694 --> 00:53:13,063
但现在我觉得你跟我完全相反 But at times I have the feeling you're the exact opposite.

533
00:53:13,232 --> 00:53:14,927
我也这样想的 I feel that too.

534
00:53:19,738 --> 00:53:23,606
这也是你比其他人更让我生气的原因 That's why you make me angrier than anyone else.

535
00:53:27,246 --> 00:53:29,043
我不想让你错过什么 I don't let you get away with anything.

536
00:53:30,849 --> 00:53:34,945
你这样是错的而我对你的生活有说法 You have no rights, whereas I have a say in your life.

537
00:53:36,288 --> 00:53:39,519
我们都讨厌对方因为 我们一直都是竞争者 We hate each other because we're raised as rivals.

538
00:53:40,092 --> 00:53:42,424
这是爸爸妈妈的错 It's Dad and Mom's fault.

539
00:53:42,594 --> 00:53:44,289
这也不是他们的错 And yet it's not their fault.

540
00:53:45,130 --> 00:53:47,792
他们认为这样好可以刺激我们 They think it's good, that it stimulates us.

541
00:53:50,002 --> 00:53:52,630
当跟我在一起时我想你 会觉得他们是错的 I think you hated it when I came along.

542
00:53:52,838 --> 00:53:54,237
我是说 I mean,

543
00:53:54,740 --> 00:53:58,039
当我是个婴儿的时候 你做我的妈妈 when I was a baby, you played mommy with me.

544
00:53:58,977 --> 00:54:00,535
但我长大之后 But when I got bigger --

545
00:54:00,712 --> 00:54:02,577
你的意思是父亲了 Fatter, you mean!

546
00:54:02,781 --> 00:54:04,476
母狗 bitch.

547
00:54:05,284 --> 00:54:08,048
当我跟着你到处走时 When I could start belting you for bossing me around,

548
00:54:09,354 --> 00:54:11,948
当你不能再扮演妈妈时 when you couldn't play mommy anymore,

549
00:54:12,124 --> 00:54:15,389
当我能说话时 and when I caught up with you language-wise too.

550
00:54:15,961 --> 00:54:18,452
真的吗我都不记得了 Really? I don't remember that.

551
00:54:19,097 --> 00:54:21,691
你确定你不想讲和吗 Are you sure you aren't making it up?

552
00:54:23,468 --> 00:54:25,766
不 我记得很清楚 No, I remember it really well.

553
00:54:26,538 --> 00:54:31,271
你教育我的激情没有了 The day your passion for educating me ended

554
00:54:32,344 --> 00:54:37,043
是我们在床上那晚在我们的双人床上 was when we were in bed one evening, in our pink twin beds,

555
00:54:37,749 --> 00:54:41,776
因为些什么事你说了 一大堆对我指指点点 and for some reason you launched into a speech, bossing me around.

556
00:54:43,021 --> 00:54:45,717
而我反驳你 And wham, I pounced on you.

557
00:54:46,558 --> 00:54:50,429
你向妈妈抱怨使我很高兴 I was pleased because you called Mom to complain

558
00:54:50,429 --> 00:54:54,832
我应该狠狠的反驳你 你有两个地方被打伤 that I'd pinched you really hard, and you had two big bruises.

559
00:54:56,969 --> 00:54:58,664
从那天开始 since that day,

560
00:54:59,471 --> 00:55:01,871
你就变了 the wind's gone out of your sails.

561
00:55:05,477 --> 00:55:08,037
你不在指挥我 You've never bossed me around again.

562
00:55:08,213 --> 00:55:10,613
我一点都不记得了 I don't remember that at all.

563
00:55:10,782 --> 00:55:12,613
我记得很清楚 I remember it perfectly.

564
00:55:14,119 --> 00:55:17,646
我对你很好我会开车带你去散步 I was nice with you. I'd wheel you in your stroller

565
00:55:17,823 --> 00:55:20,223
叫自己是妈妈 and call myself Mommy Lélaine.

566
00:55:22,661 --> 00:55:25,221
我讨厌那样 真的吗 - I hated that. - You did?

567
00:55:46,752 --> 00:55:48,310
你必须接受这太不公平了 You have to admit, it's pretty unfair.

568
00:55:48,487 --> 00:55:52,218
你做什么都可以比我早两年 You're allowed to do things two years sooner than I could.

569
00:55:56,695 --> 00:55:59,163
是的 我不否认那不公平 Yes, I'm not denying that's unfair.

570
00:56:01,099 --> 00:56:04,091
如果不是就没有好处了 If not, there's no advantage in being second.

571
00:56:04,936 --> 00:56:09,964
另外很多人都想分清你和我 Besides, so many people don't bother to remember which one's which

572
00:56:10,542 --> 00:56:14,239
因为我们的昵称一样 我的意思是我们不像 since we have the same surname. I mean, we're not alike.

573
00:56:14,446 --> 00:56:16,710
那是真的我们不像 That's for sure, we're not alike!

574
00:56:16,848 --> 00:56:18,008
母狗 bitch!

575
00:56:18,583 --> 00:56:20,983
我变成那么卑鄙了 I wasn't being mean.

576
00:56:25,957 --> 00:56:28,221
要不要我告诉你一个秘密 Want me to tell you a secret?

577
00:56:46,111 --> 00:56:48,204
佛兰多给我的 Fernando gave me this.

578
00:56:50,816 --> 00:56:52,511
是订婚戒指 It's an engagement ring.

579
00:56:54,319 --> 00:56:57,186
是紫色的猫眼石 他不会给你的 A mauve opal. - He can't have given you that.

580
00:56:57,689 --> 00:56:59,054
你丧失理智了 You're out of your mind.

581
00:56:59,791 --> 00:57:01,053
一定是被俘虏了 There must be a catch.

582
00:57:01,193 --> 00:57:03,559
不是的 我们订婚了 No. This way, we're engaged now.

583
00:57:04,396 --> 00:57:05,260
这是个约定 It's a pact.

584
00:57:06,598 --> 00:57:08,691
我要定做的 I need to get it fitted.

585
00:57:08,834 --> 00:57:12,235
他什么时候给这个你的 在山丘上 - When did he glve you that? - In the dunes.

586
00:57:13,939 --> 00:57:17,500
像鱼腥一样我不信你会接受 Something's fishy. I don't think you should have accepted.

587
00:57:17,709 --> 00:57:20,234
我不知道这太贵重了 It's not right. it's too valuable.

588
00:57:20,412 --> 00:57:23,279
拿着 我才不要什么戒指 Hold on. I didn't want some shitty ring!

589
00:57:23,482 --> 00:57:25,575
他到底在哪得到这个的 Where the hell did he get it?

590
00:57:25,717 --> 00:57:27,582
他祖母给他的 His grandmother left it to him.

591
00:57:29,588 --> 00:57:33,285
我想我今晚就要献身给他了 I think I'm going to give myself to him tonight.

592
00:57:33,992 --> 00:57:36,586
你的说话很荒谬啊 You use some really weird expressions.

593
00:57:36,762 --> 00:57:40,163
如果他用避孕套 我就随他怎么来 If he uses a condom, I'll let him go all the way.

594
00:57:41,533 --> 00:57:43,091
得了别讲那些细节 Spare me the details, please.

595
00:57:46,037 --> 00:57:48,062
你不知道我有多怕 You have no idea how scared I am.

596
00:57:48,507 --> 00:57:50,805
总有一天我还是要经历的 Still, I have to go through it one day.

597
00:57:51,743 --> 00:57:54,405
所以更我爱的人做最好 So it may as well be with someone I love.

598
00:57:58,383 --> 00:58:01,682
你怎么想有什么建议 What do you think? What do you suggest?

599
00:58:04,156 --> 00:58:07,523
无论如何你已经做了的和那个 In any case, between what you've already done and that,

600
00:58:07,692 --> 00:58:10,684
已经没有什么区别了 我觉得 there's no moral difference in my opinion.

601
00:58:10,829 --> 00:58:12,820
这个完全不同 There's a world of difference!

602
00:58:14,232 --> 00:58:16,928
我要把自己第一次 Personally, I want my first time

603
00:58:17,135 --> 00:58:19,000
给一个我不爱的人 to be with a boy I don't love.

604
00:58:19,805 --> 00:58:21,204
因为之后 Because afterwards

605
00:58:21,973 --> 00:58:26,342
你知道他不再爱你或你 不再爱他你就无话可说 you realize he doesn't love you or you don't love him, and you feel dumb.

606
00:58:27,546 --> 00:58:29,673
等你恋爱了你就会了解 You'll see when you fall in love.

607
00:58:30,448 --> 00:58:31,642
我怀疑 I doubt it.

608
00:58:32,818 --> 00:58:35,150
无论如何别怪我 In any case, don't mind me.

609
00:58:35,320 --> 00:58:39,620
你别怕吵着我可以整晚的做 Do not be afraid you are disturbing with me Could be to do all night

610
00:59:09,955 --> 00:59:11,354
吻我吧 Kiss me.

611
00:59:19,965 --> 00:59:21,523
我怕 I'm scared.

612
00:59:23,134 --> 00:59:25,227
大方点 不 Be gentle. - No.

613
00:59:25,370 --> 00:59:27,930
最好前进一步 那就完事了 One hard push is best, then it's over.

614
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:32,601
不 轻轻的 相信我 - No, gently. - Trust me.

615
01:01:58,256 --> 01:02:00,520
听众来见过你了吗 Do audiences come to see you

616
01:02:00,658 --> 01:02:03,923
因为踢还是因为什么 for kicks or what?

617
01:02:04,829 --> 01:02:07,423
不是根本不是 No, not at all.

618
01:02:08,033 --> 01:02:09,898
为什么不呢为什么 Why not? Why?

619
01:02:10,101 --> 01:02:13,559
我在做性杂志 True, my show tackies sexual issues.

620
01:02:13,738 --> 01:02:16,229
没有性完全不同的 There's no sex, that's different.

621
01:02:16,408 --> 01:02:19,104
也许我不清楚性别和性的区别吧 Maybe I confuse sex and sexual issues.

622
01:02:19,310 --> 01:02:24,009
这是个性问题的调查 就这样 It's an investigation of sexual issues. That's all.

623
01:02:25,016 --> 01:02:28,008
这在法国很困难 Its a big problem in France.

624
01:02:28,586 --> 01:02:31,453
已经有了巴多特这样的性杂志 You have Bardot, who is a sexual issue.

625
01:02:31,656 --> 01:02:34,216
不 她是个案例不是杂志 No, she's a case, not an issue.

626
01:02:34,392 --> 01:02:36,792
她是个案例所以可以上杂志 She's a case, so she's an issue.

627
01:02:36,961 --> 01:02:40,488
你应该看看德贝未诺的文章 You should read what De Beauvoir wrote.

628
01:02:40,665 --> 01:02:43,463
她的文章写的很好我喜欢巴多特 She wrote some great things. I love Bardot,

629
01:02:43,668 --> 01:02:45,363
但是个性杂志 but she's a sexual issue.

630
01:02:45,570 --> 01:02:48,266
你为什么要研究性问题啊 So why do you investigate this issue?

631
01:02:48,473 --> 01:02:53,501
这是个简单而明显的 问题每个人都理解 It's a simple and obvious issue that everyone can understand.

632
01:02:53,645 --> 01:02:56,637
这是个人类简单的问题 It's a very simple human issue.

633
01:02:56,781 --> 01:02:59,648
但是没有人做得完美 And no one is perfect on that level.

634
01:02:59,851 --> 01:03:03,252
其他的问题更复杂 things are more complicated with other issues,

635
01:03:03,421 --> 01:03:05,912
让世界很混乱 given the confusion in the world.

636
01:03:06,091 --> 01:03:09,254
那你呢你觉得自己的水平还不够吗 How about you? How do you fall short on that level?

637
01:03:10,495 --> 01:03:11,894
我没有说 I'm not saying.

638
01:03:19,871 --> 01:03:21,566
她很好是不是 She's great, isn't she?

639
01:03:24,375 --> 01:03:28,209
我从来不了解人我很想知道 可是我出生太迟了 I'll never know the people I'd like to know. I was born too late.

640
01:03:36,221 --> 01:03:38,917
叨扰下这是平高特家吗 Excuse me. Is this the Pingot home?

641
01:03:39,124 --> 01:03:41,684
说吧这不是什么难回答的问题 Come now, It's not a difficult question.

642
01:03:41,860 --> 01:03:44,727
我仍觉得等这样的答案很愚蠢 Still, I suppose it's stupid to expect an answer.

643
01:03:44,929 --> 01:03:47,227
那样的话我还是进来吧 In that case, I'll come in.

644
01:03:48,733 --> 01:03:51,133
我是佛兰多的妈妈 I'm Fernando's mother.

645
01:03:51,302 --> 01:03:53,998
很抱歉我只是走路过来 I'm sorry. I just walked right in.

646
01:03:54,205 --> 01:03:56,901
你是埃琳娜的妈妈吗 Are you Elena's mother?

647
01:03:57,909 --> 01:04:01,401
我烦着你了吧 没有 Am I disturbing you. - Not at all!

648
01:04:01,579 --> 01:04:04,776
这些苔藓和水草长得真快啊 The moss grows so fast with all this wet grass.

649
01:04:04,916 --> 01:04:09,615
这里很乱 This is very awkward, you see. Very awkward indeed.

650
01:04:10,155 --> 01:04:12,715
没有不是的 No, not at all. Really.

651
01:04:14,492 --> 01:04:18,087
这里太乱了 It's an awkward situation.

652
01:04:18,263 --> 01:04:19,821
真的不是 我打扰你了 - Not at all. - I'm bothering you.

653
01:04:19,998 --> 01:04:23,593
不 我真得要感谢你 你儿子是 No. I really must compliment you. Your son is  --

654
01:04:26,070 --> 01:04:28,630
这太混乱了 It's an awkward situation.

655
01:04:28,806 --> 01:04:31,707
我不知道该怎么开始 I don't know where to begin.

656
01:04:33,278 --> 01:04:35,075
你知道每个暑假 You know, every summer,

657
01:04:35,280 --> 01:04:39,182
我都带些珠宝 I always bring a few valuable jewels along.

658
01:04:40,485 --> 01:04:45,047
有些很昂贵的 其他的都是 普通的珠宝 你也知道 Some precious, others just costume jewelry, you see.

659
01:04:46,324 --> 01:04:48,485
我不是每天都检查的 I don't check on them every day.

660
01:04:48,626 --> 01:04:51,459
问题是他们都带着记忆 Trouble is, they're memories.

661
01:04:51,663 --> 01:04:54,530
戒指代表你将要结婚的男人 Rings represent the men

662
01:04:54,732 --> 01:04:57,826
你也知道的 whom you managed to make understand

663
01:04:57,969 --> 01:05:02,065
他才会给戒指你 that they should offer them to you, you see?

664
01:05:02,207 --> 01:05:03,606
我不明白 I don't understand.

665
01:05:03,775 --> 01:05:06,573
而且这完全是荒谬 Besides, it's totally ridiculous

666
01:05:06,778 --> 01:05:12,045
把那么贵重的戒指给年轻的姑娘 to give such a valuable ring to some young girl

667
01:05:12,183 --> 01:05:15,209
你刚才遇到谁了 whom you just happen to meet

668
01:05:15,353 --> 01:05:16,752
我在度假 on vacation.

669
01:05:16,921 --> 01:05:18,479
这这是荒谬 It's totally absurd!

670
01:05:18,656 --> 01:05:20,521
什么戒指你说什么 What ring? What do you mean?

671
01:05:20,725 --> 01:05:23,592
我那紫红色的猫眼石 My mauve opal.

672
01:05:24,028 --> 01:05:29,489
我不知道她为什么这样就接受 I don't understand how she could have accepted it just like that.

673
01:05:29,901 --> 01:05:34,600
我儿子还太年轻 不能 处理我的财产 我还没死 My son is too young to dispose of my property. I'm not dead yet!

674
01:05:34,806 --> 01:05:37,502
我也不想死 And I don't intend to die!

675
01:05:38,409 --> 01:05:42,971
我毫无头绪 但我的女儿不是这样的人 I don't understand any of this, but my daughter's not like that.

676
01:05:53,424 --> 01:05:55,688
你在这里啊 你的姐姐在哪里 There you are. Where's your sister?

677
01:05:56,494 --> 01:05:58,052
我又不是她的保姆 I'm not her keeper.

678
01:05:59,063 --> 01:06:00,632
你疯了啊 You're crazy.

679
01:06:00,632 --> 01:06:05,001
你是不是一直都要拖她后腿啊 You're always ready to back her up when she screws up, aren't you?

680
01:06:05,370 --> 01:06:08,237
你疯了 别装作不知道 - You're crazy. - Don't pretend you don't know.

681
01:06:08,439 --> 01:06:11,135
她有个属于这位女士的戒指 She has a ring that belongs to this lady.

682
01:06:12,010 --> 01:06:15,275
你儿子不能亲自来吗 闭嘴 - Couldn't your son come himself? - Stop it.

683
01:06:31,729 --> 01:06:34,823
你要走了吗 我们总要回家的 - You're leaving? - We have to go home one day.

684
01:06:34,966 --> 01:06:37,230
不可能逗留太久 这就是生活 - You didn't stay long. - That's life.

685
01:06:40,571 --> 01:06:42,971
听点音乐吧 Can we have some music on?

686
01:06:57,755 --> 01:06:59,450
我什么都没做 I didn't do anything.

687
01:07:00,591 --> 01:07:03,856
我因为她而大叫 I get yelled at because of her.

688
01:07:07,932 --> 01:07:10,332
我的度假心情都给破坏了 And my vacation's been wrecked.

689
01:08:45,029 --> 01:08:47,429
你爸爸想你考试 Your father wants to have you examined.

690
01:08:53,704 --> 01:08:55,831
要不要来份警察的报告啊 How about a police report too?

691
01:08:56,874 --> 01:08:59,104
发表在报纸上 Published in the papers?

692
01:09:00,211 --> 01:09:02,975
是的他可以的 我的女儿 He c an't. - Oh, yes, he can, my girl.

693
01:09:03,181 --> 01:09:05,445
你要先想清楚 You should have thought of that first!

694
01:09:07,185 --> 01:09:09,415
我想你应该还没试过 I suppose you never had a first time?

695
01:09:10,154 --> 01:09:12,554
有没有得到你爸爸的同意啊 did you ask your dad's permission?

696
01:09:12,723 --> 01:09:14,350
那不是我 This isn't about me.

697
01:09:17,995 --> 01:09:19,690
我讨厌这样 I'm sick of it.

698
01:09:20,598 --> 01:09:23,897
别装蒜了我讨厌你痛哭流涕的样子 Stop this playacting! I'm sick of you sniveling!

699
01:09:24,635 --> 01:09:26,330
我忍不住哭 I can't help crying.

700
01:09:26,537 --> 01:09:28,801
好 那别哭出声音 Well, cry in silence, then.

701
01:09:32,276 --> 01:09:33,834
妈妈 Mom.

停车吧 我觉得好难受 Stop the car, please. I feel sick.

703
01:09:51,762 --> 01:09:53,457
看看这母狗 Look at the bitch.

704
01:09:54,532 --> 01:09:57,228
她很自以为是 闭嘴 She's pleased with herself! - Shut up.

705
01:09:58,369 --> 01:09:59,927
我讨厌她 I hate her.

我不管 我会和她一起死 I don't care. I'll die with her.

708
01:10:14,118 --> 01:10:15,813
对你自己说 Speak for yourself.

01:10:19,023 --> 01:10:21,116
我不想死 I don't want to die.

710
01:10:22,527 --> 01:10:24,552
别冒这个险 No danger of that.

711
01:10:25,496 --> 01:10:27,589
阎罗王还不想见你 You're not in the dead man's seat.

712
01:10:36,674 --> 01:10:38,767
关掉它吧好恐怖 Turn that down! it's horrible!

713

我在开车需要有人陪我 I'm driving. I need to keep myself company.

714
01:11:52,383 --> 01:11:54,647
人都是猪 People are pigs.

715
01:11:54,785 --> 01:11:56,343
典型的法国人 Typical French.

716
01:12:00,891 --> 01:12:03,291
我们够羞耻的了 We have enough to be ashamed of.

717
01:12:19,076 --> 01:12:21,340
你又开始吃了啊 You're eating again?

718
01:12:47,938 --> 01:12:49,337
妈妈 这太恐怖了 Mom, that's terrible!

我要尿尿 I have to pee.

723
01:17:32,723 --> 01:17:34,987
你以为她会把一切都告诉爸爸 You think she told dad everything

724
01:17:35,726 --> 01:17:37,523
那他就要检查我了 and that he'll have me examined?

725
01:17:41,332 --> 01:17:42,799
我不知道 I don't know.

726
01:17:43,567 --> 01:17:46,559
