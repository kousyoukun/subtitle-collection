Hey, Commander,
uh, so, as I was saying,

159
00:10:05,954 --> 00:10:08,484
in "The Quasar Dilemma," remember,
you used the auxiliary of deck B--

00:10:08,551 --> 00:10:11,314
could you get this--
deck B for gamma override.

161
00:10:11,381 --> 00:10:14,077

448
00:30:19,370 --> 00:30:21,800
Sure. Bring 'em in.

449
00:30:21,867 --> 00:30:24,330
[ Shrilling ]

450
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:41,207
[ Chuckles ] No pressure, huh ?
Glad I ain't the commander.

451
00:30:43,105 --> 00:30:45,202
Laredo, take us out.

452
00:30:47,233 --> 00:30:50,462
- Excuse me ?
- [ Chuckles ]

453
00:30:50,528 --> 00:30:54,922
They designed those controls
after watching you.

454
00:30:54,989 --> 00:30:58,684
- Take her out.
- [ Clears Throat ] Right, right.

455
00:30:58,751 --> 00:31:00,848
Okay.

456
00:31:00,914 --> 00:31:03,511
Right.

457
00:31:03,578 --> 00:31:06,907
Right.
Take her out.

458
00:31:09,570 --> 00:31:12,233
[ Banging ]

459
00:31:12,299 --> 00:31:15,029
- [ Air Rushing ]
- [ Spaceship Revving ]

460
00:31:23,018 --> 00:31:25,082
[ Beeping ]

461
00:31:29,576 --> 00:31:32,972
[ Spaceship Rising ]

462
00:32:08,391 --> 00:32:10,289
Okay.

463
00:32:10,355 --> 00:32:12,286
Y-you gotta move
to the right.

464
00:32:12,353 --> 00:32:15,482
- Hit parallel.
- Would you sit your ass down ?
Sit ! You wanna drive ?

465
00:32:18,644 --> 00:32:22,972
[ Metal Scraping ]

466
00:32:23,038 --> 00:32:26,401
- [ Nervous Chuckle ]
- [ High-Pitched Scraping ]

467
00:32:43,045 --> 00:32:44,976
[ Scraping Stops ]

468
00:33:05,648 --> 00:33:08,345
[ Jason ]
Oh. Mmm.

469
00:33:08,411 --> 00:33:10,941
How are you enjoying
your steak, Commander ?

470
00:33:11,008 --> 00:33:14,836
I'm really enjoying it.
This is like corn-fed lowa beef.

471
00:33:14,903 --> 00:33:17,566
Yes. We programmed
the food synthesizer...

472
00:33:17,632 --> 00:33:20,562
for each of you based on
the regional menu of your birthplace.

473
00:33:20,628 --> 00:33:23,757
[ Jason ] I don't care where
you did it. It tastes great !

474
00:33:23,824 --> 00:33:26,654
Are you enjoying your
Kep-mok bloodticks, Dr. Lazarus ?

475
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:29,017
Just like Mother
used to make.

476
00:33:33,844 --> 00:33:36,440
So, um-- [ Groans ]
Tell me, Mathesar.

477
00:33:36,507 --> 00:33:39,170
This Sarris person
that we're flying to meet,

478
00:33:39,237 --> 00:33:41,600
- what does he want, exactly ?
- [ Gagging ]

479
00:33:41,667 --> 00:33:45,295
He heard about the device--
the Omega 13.

480
00:33:45,362 --> 00:33:48,191
Um, what is it ?
What does it do ?

481
00:33:48,258 --> 00:33:50,588
We don't know.

482
00:33:50,655 --> 00:33:53,385
We were hoping
you could enlighten us.

483
00:33:54,583 --> 00:33:57,679
[ Nervous Chuckle ]

484
00:34:00,209 --> 00:34:03,405
Oh.
The Omega 13 device.

485
00:34:03,471 --> 00:34:06,634
We found that on an alien planet.
We don't know what it does either.

486
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:09,829
- [ Gasps ]
- Why don't you just turn it on
and see what it does ?

487
00:34:09,896 --> 00:34:12,026
- [ Shrills ]
- [ Laughs ]

488
00:34:12,093 --> 00:34:16,154
It has at its heart a reactor
capable of unthinkable energy.

489
00:34:16,221 --> 00:34:18,684
If we were mistaken in our construction,
the device would...

490
00:34:18,751 --> 00:34:21,713
act as a molecular explosive,
causing a chain reaction...

491
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:24,177
that would obliterate
all matter in the universe.

492
00:34:25,775 --> 00:34:29,237
Has Sarris ever seen any
of the, uh, historical records ?

493
00:34:29,337 --> 00:34:31,301
No, thank God, he has not.

494
00:34:31,367 --> 00:34:36,294
Oh. So how does he know about
the Omega 13 device ?

495
00:34:40,555 --> 00:34:44,916
Our former commander
was not... strong.

496
00:34:44,982 --> 00:34:47,446
Former commander ?

497
00:34:48,644 --> 00:34:52,006
I am sorry.
You deserve to be shown.

498
00:34:52,073 --> 00:34:55,701
The tape was smuggled off
of Sarris' ship.

499
00:34:55,768 --> 00:34:58,298
Originally, one of our own
tried to lead.

500
00:34:58,365 --> 00:35:02,526
Is that all ?
After three days of this,

501
00:35:02,592 --> 00:35:05,688
you still require...
incentive ?

502
00:35:05,755 --> 00:35:08,518
- [ Shrieking ]
- [ Electrical Buzzing ]

503
00:35:08,584 --> 00:35:10,914
[ Female ]
I have told you all I know.

504
00:35:10,981 --> 00:35:13,644
If you have any mercy within you,
please, let me die.

505
00:35:13,711 --> 00:35:17,506
[ Sarris ] When I grow weary
of the noises you make, you shall die.

506
00:35:17,572 --> 00:35:19,969
[ Electrical Buzzing ]

507
00:35:31,687 --> 00:35:34,883
Wait a minute, guys. Come on.
Hold on a minute. You just can't leave.

508
00:35:34,949 --> 00:35:36,980
- Give me some time to think.
- He wants to think.

509
00:35:37,046 --> 00:35:39,510
No, Jason, that's a wrap.
There's nothing to think about.

510
00:35:39,610 --> 00:35:42,872
I'm not even supposed to be here. I'm
just crewman number six. I'm expendable.

511
00:35:42,938 --> 00:35:46,867
I'm the guy in the episode who dies
to prove the situation is serious.
I gotta get out.

512
00:35:46,933 --> 00:35:51,194
- Commander ?
- We gotta prepare the pods
for my crew's departure.

513
00:35:51,261 --> 00:35:54,190
Begging your commander's pardon, sir.
We can't launch pods at the moment.

514
00:35:54,257 --> 00:35:57,552
- Sarris will surely detonate
any objects leaving the ship.
- Sarris ?

515
00:35:57,619 --> 00:36:01,447
Yes, sir. He's here now. Your presence
is required on the command deck.

516
00:36:01,514 --> 00:36:03,777
[ Stammers ]

517
00:36:10,036 --> 00:36:11,966
There's nobody here.

518
00:36:12,033 --> 00:36:13,897
While my people are
talented scientists,

519
00:36:13,964 --> 00:36:16,627
our attempt to operate
our own technologies...

520
00:36:16,693 --> 00:36:18,924
under tactical simulation
have been disastrous.

521
00:36:18,990 --> 00:36:22,952
- I have raised Sarris
on zeta frequency.
- [ Jason ] Mathesar--

522
00:36:23,052 --> 00:36:25,748
We meet again, Commander.

523
00:36:25,815 --> 00:36:29,077
Hello, Sarris. How you doin' ?

524
00:36:29,144 --> 00:36:32,539
Better than my lieutenant.

525
00:36:32,606 --> 00:36:37,532
He failed to activate the ship's
neutron armor as quickly as I'd hoped...

526
00:36:37,632 --> 00:36:39,663
on our last encounter.

527
00:36:39,729 --> 00:36:43,358
Yeah, well, you know,
I'd like to say I'm real sorry
about what happened before.

528
00:36:43,424 --> 00:36:47,053
The whole thing was just--
just a misunderstanding.

529
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:49,217
Deliver the device to me,

530
00:36:49,283 --> 00:36:52,512
or I will destroy your ship.

531
00:36:52,579 --> 00:36:55,775
You know, um,
we'd like do that,

532
00:36:55,841 --> 00:36:59,436
but frankly, Sarris, sir, we don't know
what it is or even where it is.

533
00:36:59,503 --> 00:37:02,133
You have ten seconds !

534
00:37:02,199 --> 00:37:04,896
I don't-- Ten seconds ?
I don't-- There--

535
00:37:04,962 --> 00:37:09,090
You know-- Okay. Gosh darn it,
I give up. It's yours. You can have it.

536
00:37:09,157 --> 00:37:12,286
You have to give me a minute
to put it in a box for you, okay ?

537
00:37:12,353 --> 00:37:15,049
- Gwen. [ Clicks Tongue ]
- [ Groans ]

538
00:37:15,116 --> 00:37:19,809
Don't panic. I've dealt with
this guy before. He's as stupid
as he is ugly. Come here.

539
00:37:19,876 --> 00:37:23,105
- Jason.
- Not now, Gwen. Sit, sit, sit, sit.

540
00:37:23,171 --> 00:37:25,635
We're gonna send everything
we can at him, all right ?

541
00:37:25,735 --> 00:37:27,665
- [ Gwen ] Jason.
- Not now, Gwen !

542
00:37:27,732 --> 00:37:30,562
Push these red buttons and send
everything we have towards him, okay ?

543
00:37:30,628 --> 00:37:33,924
- Okay.
- All right, Gwen. [ Clears Throat ]

544
00:37:33,990 --> 00:37:38,751
- Put me back on with him.
- Well, I'm trying to tell you,
you are back with him.

545
00:37:38,817 --> 00:37:43,644
Perhaps I'm not as stupid
as I am ugly, Commander.

546
00:37:46,773 --> 00:37:51,301
I gave you the...
"kill" gesture.

547
00:37:51,367 --> 00:37:53,564
No, you gave me
the "we're dead" signal.

548
00:37:53,631 --> 00:37:56,394
I was agreeing with you.
Like I know where the hold button is.

549
00:37:56,460 --> 00:37:58,724
[ Guy ]
Hey, guys.

550
00:37:58,791 --> 00:38:02,486
- [ Beeping On Monitor ]
- There's a red, uh, thingy...

551
00:38:02,552 --> 00:38:04,583
movin' toward the green thingy.

552
00:38:04,650 --> 00:38:08,211
- What ?
- Red thingy movin'
toward the green thingy.

553
00:38:09,809 --> 00:38:12,705
I think-- I think
we're the green thingy.

554
00:38:12,772 --> 00:38:16,167
A little present
for you, Commander.

555
00:38:16,234 --> 00:38:18,464
We gotta get out of here. Move
this ship. Turn it. Move ! Let's go !

556
00:38:20,162 --> 00:38:22,359

- [ Explosion ]
- [ Screams ]

559

- Tommy, let's go !
Get us out of here !
- Jason, what do I do ?

560
00:38:38,571 --> 00:38:40,169
Go, go, go !

561
00:38:41,867 --> 00:38:44,163
[ Screaming ]

562
00:38:45,229 --> 00:38:47,193
Whoo !

563
00:38:52,053 --> 00:38:56,148
They're turning.
They're coming !

- [ Explosion ]
- Go faster, Tommy !

567
00:39:11,327 --> 00:39:15,522
- I'm going as fast as I can !
- She's still behind us !

568
00:39:15,588 --> 00:39:18,518
Well, uh, uh, press turbo. I'm always
saying, "Press the turbo," right ?

569
00:39:18,584 --> 00:39:21,381
- Oh, it's here. Right here.
- Press it and hold it down.

- [ Whooshing ]
- Whoo !

572
00:39:27,506 --> 00:39:29,936
[ Computerized Voice ]
The enemy is matching velocity.

573
00:39:30,002 --> 00:39:33,398
- Enemy is matching velocity.
- We heard it the first time !

574
00:39:33,464 --> 00:39:36,594
Gosh, I'm doing it.
I'm repeating the darn computer.

Hi, guys. Listen.
They're tellin' me...

576
00:39:41,121 --> 00:39:45,548
the, uh-- the generators
won't take it.

577
00:39:45,615 --> 00:39:48,411
The ship is breakin' apart
and all that.

578
00:39:48,478 --> 00:39:50,675
Just F.Y.I.

579
00:39:50,741 --> 00:39:54,669
- We've gotta stop !
- We stop and we die.
Tommy, just hold that down.

580
00:39:54,769 --> 00:39:58,697
- You don't hold the turbo down.
It's for quick boosts !
- Oh, like you know.

- [ Alarm Blaring ]
- [ Gwen ] I remember that sound.

583
00:40:05,721 --> 00:40:07,586
That's a bad sound.

584
00:40:07,652 --> 00:40:11,813
Wait, wait, wait, wait. We might be able
to lose them in this cloud here.

585
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:14,410
Oh, I don't--
I don't think that's a cloud.

586
00:40:14,476 --> 00:40:19,570
- Mathesar, what is this ?
- Tothian minefield left standing
from the Great War of 12185.

00:40:25,495 --> 00:40:29,090
Oh, God ! [ Screams ]

Could you possibly try
not to hit every single one ?

591
00:40:43,471 --> 00:40:47,066
Sorry, man. They're driftin'
towards us ! I think they're magnetic !
