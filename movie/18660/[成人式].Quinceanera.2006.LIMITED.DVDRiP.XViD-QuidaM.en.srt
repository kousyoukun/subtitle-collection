1
00:00:26,559 --> 00:00:27,856
Good afternoon.

2
00:00:28,695 --> 00:00:30,094
First of aII...

3
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:34,425
...I'd Iike to weIcome you
to the ceIebration...

4
00:00:34,634 --> 00:00:39,628
...of this marveIous day
in a beautifuI young girI's Iife.

5
00:00:39,906 --> 00:00:43,342
The Quincea¨¾era of EiIeen Garcia.

6
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:48,176
On this day she turns 1 5.

7
00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:50,638
Today...

8
00:00:51,251 --> 00:00:54,516
...she becomes a woman.

9
00:00:59,926 --> 00:01:00,950
Magdalena.

10
00:01:06,199 --> 00:01:09,635
We're gonna take another picture.
Before the picture. HoId it.

11
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:16,508
-Herman, Iook over here.
-Come on, fooI, right here.

12
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:18,540
Look right here.

13
00:02:04,841 --> 00:02:08,541
Quincea¨¾era

14
00:02:31,718 --> 00:02:33,049
Okay, smiIe now.

15
00:03:02,081 --> 00:03:03,173
No!

16
00:03:22,268 --> 00:03:23,530
Don't teII my mom.

17
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:12,345
EiIeen Iooks reaIIy beautifuI.

18
00:04:12,619 --> 00:04:15,611
-So does Magdalena.
-We have a Iot to be proud of.

19
00:04:15,822 --> 00:04:18,484
Magdalena's Quincea¨¾era
is coming up soon. When is it? JuIy?

20
00:04:18,691 --> 00:04:19,988
No. In June.

21
00:04:21,027 --> 00:04:22,722
Get ready to pay through the nose.

22
00:04:22,996 --> 00:04:25,931
You know, WaIter,
Magdalena's won't be Iike that.

23
00:04:26,132 --> 00:04:27,724
She's different.

24
00:04:28,668 --> 00:04:30,602
She's a more traditionaI girI
than EiIeen.

25
00:04:30,803 --> 00:04:32,998
AII right, Ernesto. If you say so.

26
00:04:55,762 --> 00:04:59,027
-Your hair Iooks funny Iike that.
-That's a nice comment.

27
00:04:59,232 --> 00:05:00,665
Just trying to make conversation.

28
00:05:00,867 --> 00:05:02,596
Don't bother.

29
00:05:10,677 --> 00:05:12,372
-So did you go with Jessica?
-No.

30
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:14,772
-Not what I heard.
-I don't care about her.

31
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:19,348
Didn't you get the text I sent you?

32
00:05:19,552 --> 00:05:21,679
Yeah. I deIeted it.

33
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:43,375
GirIs, do you have a chopping bIock
for the onions?

34
00:05:43,643 --> 00:05:46,305
There aren't any more.

35
00:05:46,546 --> 00:05:49,640
Maria, I was thinking
that I couId madrina the dress...

36
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:51,316
...for Magdalena's Quincea¨¾era.

37
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:53,849
ReaIIy? She'II be so happy.

38
00:05:54,053 --> 00:05:56,544
I couId aIter EiIeen's to fit her.

39
00:05:56,756 --> 00:05:59,748
Thank you, sister,
you're aIways so good.

40
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:02,894
Silvia, I haven't seen Carlos yet.

41
00:06:03,129 --> 00:06:04,858
He's not coming.

42
00:06:05,064 --> 00:06:07,430
He's not coming
to his own sister's Quincea¨¾era?

43
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,429
Aunt Silvia,
UncIe Walter wants you.

44
00:06:09,902 --> 00:06:12,370
Don't taIk to me about that boy.

45
00:06:39,999 --> 00:06:43,025
One, two, three.

46
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:45,727
Ladies and GentIemen...

47
00:06:45,938 --> 00:06:48,736
...thank you for coming
to EiIeen's Quincea¨¾era.

48
00:06:49,175 --> 00:06:51,735
Now it's time to dance and groove!

49
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,846
Look at the muscIes on this one.

50
00:06:57,049 --> 00:06:59,517
If onIy I was 20 years younger!

51
00:06:59,719 --> 00:07:01,653
Forty years!

52
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:03,953
You got the urge?

53
00:07:04,157 --> 00:07:06,216
Yeah! Look! Look!

54
00:07:08,494 --> 00:07:11,554
Is Tio Tomas ready?

55
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:12,958
-Here.
-Thank you, Mama.

56
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:15,259
Thank you, mijo.

57
00:07:28,181 --> 00:07:29,739
Thank you, Junior.

58
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:36,484
Why is Tio Tomas eating worms?

59
00:07:36,722 --> 00:07:38,747
It's not worms. It's fat from the meat.

60
00:08:13,526 --> 00:08:14,515
What's up, Magdalena?

61
00:08:18,531 --> 00:08:21,625
U R STILL IN MY HEART
From: Herman

62
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:39,217
Carlos, what are you doing here?

63
00:08:39,452 --> 00:08:42,319
Happy Birthday, hermanita.
I got that for you.

64
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:43,682
You better get out of here.

65
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:45,380
-What are you doing here?
-Nothing.

66
00:08:45,591 --> 00:08:47,058
You're trying to embarrass me.

67
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:49,524
-I toId you not to be here.
-None of your business.

68
00:08:49,729 --> 00:08:52,163
You're not my son anymore!
I don't want you here.

69
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:54,458
Fuck you! It's my sister's birthday,
you asshoIe.

70
00:08:54,667 --> 00:08:56,862
Get out! You disgust me.
Get out of here.

71
00:08:57,103 --> 00:08:58,866
-Fuck you!
-No, Daddy, no.

72
00:09:02,241 --> 00:09:04,266
-You better get off me, man!
-Carlos!

73
00:09:05,578 --> 00:09:07,478
I'm going!

74
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:10,744
Don't do it, Carlos.
Don't ruin your sister's speciaI day.

75
00:09:15,588 --> 00:09:17,613
I don't want to hit you again.

76
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:21,255
Carlos, go home.

77
00:09:24,263 --> 00:09:25,594
I'II see you at home.

78
00:09:32,438 --> 00:09:35,407
Let's go. Let's get back. Come on.

79
00:09:35,608 --> 00:09:38,543
Everybody, thank you for coming
to this Quincea¨¾era.

80
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:44,343
It's a speciaI day for a Quincea¨¾era.

81
00:09:45,685 --> 00:09:47,619
Thank you, everybody,
for showing Iove.

82
00:09:58,698 --> 00:10:01,428
-Oh, my God, that was crazy.
-I know.

83
00:10:01,667 --> 00:10:03,897
He hit him so hard.

84
00:10:04,303 --> 00:10:06,464
First of aII, a famiIy party
and that happens.

85
00:10:06,872 --> 00:10:09,170
I was kind of embarrassed.
That's my cousin. Come on.

86
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:11,433
It's her big day, her Quincea¨¾era.

87
00:10:11,677 --> 00:10:13,235
Did you see her at the end?
Her face?

88
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:16,813
She'd been crying and her mascara
was smeared everywhere.

89
00:10:17,049 --> 00:10:19,813
-Carlos is so stupid to do that.
-He shouIdn't have been there.

90
00:10:20,052 --> 00:10:21,485
ExactIy. It's her Quincea¨¾era.

91
00:10:21,721 --> 00:10:23,018
-Oh, my God.
-What is it?

92
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:24,586
-Look.
-Who is it?

93
00:10:24,857 --> 00:10:26,222
It's Herman.

94
00:10:26,425 --> 00:10:28,188
Look at you. You're going aII red.

95
00:10:28,394 --> 00:10:29,486
Shut up.

96
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:03,826
They kicked him out
of the house, why?

97
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:06,289
He didn't say.

98
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:08,023
Neither wouId Silvia. I asked her.

99
00:11:08,234 --> 00:11:10,065
Here he is.

100
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:13,828
Oh, my God. Carlos, Iook at you.
You're going to spoiI your Iooks.

101
00:11:14,106 --> 00:11:16,074
-Let me cIean you up.
-I'm cooI, Tia.

102
00:11:16,409 --> 00:11:19,537
-Come on, it's Iate.
-Let me take care of him.

103
00:11:20,579 --> 00:11:22,672
Candy, Iet's go.

104
00:11:23,382 --> 00:11:24,815
Bye, Tio.

105
00:11:32,124 --> 00:11:33,853
You wiII Iive.

106
00:11:41,801 --> 00:11:43,291
Come in.

107
00:11:44,837 --> 00:11:46,828
I'm gIad you're stiII awake.

108
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:50,267
I hardIy got to see you aII day.

109
00:11:51,143 --> 00:11:52,303
You have fun?

110
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,776
It was a beautifuI Quincea¨¾era.

111
00:11:56,982 --> 00:11:58,540
Oh, weII, except for the end.

112
00:11:58,751 --> 00:12:01,743
But EiIeen's dress was beautifuI,
wasn't it?

113
00:12:01,954 --> 00:12:03,046
Yeah, it was beautifuI.

114
00:12:03,422 --> 00:12:06,914
Aunt Silvia said she wouId aIter it
for your Quincea¨¾era.

115
00:12:07,126 --> 00:12:08,889
-That's nice.
-What do you mean ''nice''?

116
00:12:09,095 --> 00:12:10,357
It was a wonderfuI dress.

117
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:12,224
I know, Mom, but....

118
00:12:13,466 --> 00:12:15,434
I wanted a new dress
for my Quincea¨¾era.

119
00:12:15,801 --> 00:12:18,326
WeII, your father
is not UncIe Walter.

120
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:20,539
He doesn't have money
to throw around.

121
00:12:24,143 --> 00:12:25,371
Can I get a Hummer Iimo?

122
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:26,840
What?

123
00:12:27,046 --> 00:12:29,571
If we save money with the dress,
can I get a Hummer Iimo?

124
00:12:29,782 --> 00:12:31,215
The same one that EiIeen had.

125
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:33,647
Where do you get these ideas?

126
00:12:33,853 --> 00:12:35,480
PIease.

127
00:12:35,688 --> 00:12:37,713
Just taIk to Dad
about it for me, pIease.

128
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:39,322
Promise me.

129
00:12:40,326 --> 00:12:42,089
Thanks, Mama.

130
00:13:39,685 --> 00:13:40,652
HeIIo.

131
00:13:40,853 --> 00:13:43,253
I got the rent check.
Thanks so much.

132
00:14:01,407 --> 00:14:04,137
Champurrado!

133
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:11,409
Here you are, honey.
Put your money there, wiII you?

134
00:14:12,818 --> 00:14:15,810
Tio Tomas, when wiII you give me
the recipe for the champurrados?

135
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:18,046
When you get as oId as me, honey.

136
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:22,018
-Here you are, beautifuI.
-Thank you.

137
00:14:22,228 --> 00:14:24,594
Oh, my gosh.
I so need to go spring shopping.

138
00:14:24,997 --> 00:14:28,433
-It's starting to get hot.
-I need new skirts and stuff.

139
00:14:28,634 --> 00:14:30,534
I reaIIy want to go to the beach.

140
00:14:30,769 --> 00:14:32,236
We'II get bathing suits!

141
00:14:32,438 --> 00:14:35,805
With cute IittIe sandaIs to match
those cute IittIe purses.

142
00:14:36,008 --> 00:14:41,207
And cute IittIe tops.
We need sandaIs, skirts, tops--

143
00:14:41,413 --> 00:14:43,506
Remember the purpIe top
that Sandra had on?

144
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:46,742
-I saw that.
-She thought she was aII bIing-bIing.

145
00:14:46,952 --> 00:14:49,045
I saw that shirt on saIe
at Target for 9.99.

146
00:14:50,089 --> 00:14:51,954
-I swear to God. No Iie.
-What eIse?

147
00:14:52,157 --> 00:14:53,590
Let's take the bus there and see.

148
00:14:53,792 --> 00:14:56,260
-Yeah, sure.
-Yeah, aII right. Let me caII my mom.

149
00:14:56,495 --> 00:14:58,725
ActuaIIy, I gotta get going.
See you Iadies Iater.

150
00:14:58,931 --> 00:15:00,523
-Bye.
-Bye, girI.

151
00:15:02,635 --> 00:15:05,126
-Hey, Mom. I'm fine.
-I reaIIy need makeup.

152
00:15:05,371 --> 00:15:08,829
Me and some girIs are going
to take the bus to GIendaIe...

153
00:15:09,108 --> 00:15:10,700
...and go shopping.

154
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:13,242
Yeah, sure, I'II be home
in pIenty of time.

155
00:15:37,503 --> 00:15:41,872
If you couId time traveI to any period
in time, where wouId you go?

156
00:15:42,374 --> 00:15:46,003
I'd go way, way back.
ProbabIy to Jesus' time or something.

157
00:15:46,245 --> 00:15:47,803
-ReaIIy?
-Yeah.

158
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:50,514
PeopIe have so many different
versions of the BibIe.

159
00:15:50,716 --> 00:15:54,049
I'd Iike to go back
and see what reaIIy happened.

160
00:15:54,253 --> 00:15:55,550
You know what that says?

161
00:15:56,522 --> 00:15:59,389
-Herman Ioves Jessica.
-It says Magdalena.

162
00:16:00,859 --> 00:16:02,224
What time wouId you go to?

163
00:16:02,861 --> 00:16:06,991
Nineteenth-century France.
AII those painters and shit.

164
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:10,362
I want to hang out with Van Gogh,
teII him he's gonna be a big hit.

165
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:13,998
-You're so weird.
-I know.

166
00:16:23,382 --> 00:16:25,748
You know before, what happened....

167
00:16:25,951 --> 00:16:27,646
I never meant to disrespect you.

168
00:16:27,853 --> 00:16:29,150
You didn't.

169
00:16:29,355 --> 00:16:30,720
No?

170
00:16:31,557 --> 00:16:35,186
So it was okay, what we did?

171
00:16:35,894 --> 00:16:36,861
It was okay.

172
00:16:38,864 --> 00:16:40,354
CooI.

173
00:16:50,809 --> 00:16:52,333
So why did you get so mad at me?

174
00:16:52,544 --> 00:16:53,841
You were after stupid Jessica.

175
00:16:54,046 --> 00:16:56,139
I wasn't.
That's just you being crazy.

176
00:16:56,348 --> 00:16:58,816
-Yeah?
-She Iikes me.

177
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:01,543
But I can't stand her. I swear.

178
00:17:04,656 --> 00:17:05,918
Try and catch me.

179
00:17:06,925 --> 00:17:08,415
Herman.

180
00:17:15,501 --> 00:17:17,594
-Your titties are so big.
-Shut up.

181
00:17:18,103 --> 00:17:20,731
They are.
NearIy as big as Jessica's.

182
00:17:20,939 --> 00:17:22,804
Shut up!

183
00:17:25,511 --> 00:17:27,103
-I missed you.
-Good.

184
00:17:27,312 --> 00:17:29,906
-Did you miss me?
-No.

185
00:17:33,619 --> 00:17:35,519
You're so beautifuI.

186
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:41,756
-I Iike you so much.
-Herman.

187
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,518
I do.

188
00:17:45,197 --> 00:17:47,495
-FeeI that.
-No.

189
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:49,425
Come on.

190
00:17:53,138 --> 00:17:54,628
I Iove you.

191
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:04,677
This thing's not gonna work.

192
00:18:04,883 --> 00:18:07,283
That's the onIy one we have.

193
00:18:08,353 --> 00:18:09,342
Sorry I'm Iate, Tio.

194
00:18:09,621 --> 00:18:11,248
They thought
you weren't coming today.

195
00:18:11,457 --> 00:18:13,789
Oh, no. Come here, buddy.

196
00:18:13,992 --> 00:18:14,959
I'II get the Ieashes.

197
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,457
Okay.

198
00:18:16,662 --> 00:18:18,289
-Don't I get a heIIo?
-HeIIo.

199
00:18:18,497 --> 00:18:21,489
Gee, thanks. What's up with you?

200
00:18:22,501 --> 00:18:24,093
Nothing.

201
00:18:25,504 --> 00:18:28,268
EiIeen toId me
some things about you.

202
00:18:28,907 --> 00:18:31,671
-What things?
-Just things.

203
00:18:33,378 --> 00:18:35,471
And don't Iet them shit
on the Hernandez's Iawn.

204
00:18:35,881 --> 00:18:37,473
AII right. Come on, boys.

205
00:18:37,683 --> 00:18:39,708
This time take them for more
than five minutes.

206
00:18:39,918 --> 00:18:41,180
Yes, Tio Tomas.

207
00:18:49,328 --> 00:18:52,229
Yeah, we're IandIords now.
It's two units.

208
00:18:52,531 --> 00:18:55,796
There's ours and then this pIace
in the back where this oId guy Iives.

209
00:18:56,001 --> 00:18:57,696
Yeah, the rate was good
It's a 30-year.

210
00:18:57,903 --> 00:19:00,667
But it's stiII a shitIoad
of money per month.

211
00:19:02,841 --> 00:19:06,470
There's a super hot choIo coming up
the back stairs wearing a wife beater.

212
00:19:06,678 --> 00:19:09,875
James! James, the back door.

213
00:19:10,782 --> 00:19:11,874
HeIIo.

214
00:19:12,084 --> 00:19:15,076
-You guys got an adjustabIe wrench?
-A what?

215
00:19:15,287 --> 00:19:17,653
An adjustabIe wrench
for the garbage disposaI.

216
00:19:18,624 --> 00:19:20,057
Oh, you Iive in the back with....

217
00:19:20,359 --> 00:19:23,157
-Tomas.
-Tomas, right. Yeah, come on in.

218
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:27,328
So, Tomas is what?
Your grandfather?

219
00:19:27,566 --> 00:19:29,557
No, he's my uncIe.

220
00:19:30,269 --> 00:19:34,603
That garden he pIanted is reaIIy
unbeIievabIe. How oId is he?

221
00:19:34,806 --> 00:19:37,832
Eighty-three, four.
He's my great-great-uncIe.

222
00:19:38,043 --> 00:19:39,567
He's Iived back there a Iong time?

223
00:19:39,778 --> 00:19:42,713
Yeah, a reaI Iong time.
Since before I was born.

224
00:19:42,915 --> 00:19:44,212
WeII, how oId are you?

225
00:19:45,784 --> 00:19:47,513
OId enough.

226
00:19:49,288 --> 00:19:52,416
-I knew it was in the truck.
-I never said it wasn't.

227
00:19:52,824 --> 00:19:54,587
AII right. WiII this do?

228
00:19:55,227 --> 00:19:58,594
Yeah, it's cooI. Thanks, guys.
I'II get it back to you guys Iater.

229
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:00,730
-No worries.
-Oh, hey, Carlos.

230
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:04,368
We're having a housewarming party
a week from Saturday.

231
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:05,537
Do you want to come?

232
00:20:06,405 --> 00:20:08,873
-What time?
-Nine, 9:30.

233
00:20:10,342 --> 00:20:14,836
I've got some things
I'm supposed to do, but we'II see.

234
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:18,039
-CooI.
-See you Iater, dude.

235
00:20:19,685 --> 00:20:22,552
-Are you crazy?
-Trust me.

236
00:20:30,028 --> 00:20:32,553
Yeah, that's good. Perfect.

237
00:20:32,764 --> 00:20:33,890
That's it. Yeah.

238
00:20:36,702 --> 00:20:38,636
Now you're getting the hang of it.

239
00:20:38,837 --> 00:20:41,237
But she's stepping on me.

240
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,774
So why are you putting
your feet here?

241
00:20:44,509 --> 00:20:46,306
That's the way.

242
00:20:54,353 --> 00:20:55,752
Oh, Lord.

243
00:20:58,857 --> 00:21:01,121
Magdalena's starting
to Iook so grown up.

244
00:21:01,326 --> 00:21:02,725
I know.

245
00:21:03,128 --> 00:21:05,824
Walter and Silvia offered
to padrino the DJ.

246
00:21:06,398 --> 00:21:08,992
That's nice.

247
00:21:10,335 --> 00:21:13,168
But there's stiII
the probIem of the car.

248
00:21:14,406 --> 00:21:16,397
I toId you aIready.

249
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:18,337
I know, but we have
everything eIse now.

250
00:21:18,543 --> 00:21:19,976
The answer is no.

251
00:21:20,178 --> 00:21:21,167
But it's her big day.

252
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:22,540
ExactIy.

253
00:21:22,748 --> 00:21:25,273
It's a miIestone in her spirituaI Iife.

254
00:21:25,484 --> 00:21:29,648
And if aII that means is riding
in a Hummer Iimo...

255
00:21:29,855 --> 00:21:33,347
...trying to keep up with EiIeen,
then God heIp her.

256
00:21:36,595 --> 00:21:39,086
I don't understand what
the probIem is. It wasn't much.

257
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:42,290
Five hundred doIIars
for the afternoon, driver incIuded.

258
00:21:42,668 --> 00:21:45,159
Ask one of the cousins.
I'm sure someone wiII padrino it.

259
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:47,463
I don't know.
He hates the whoIe idea.

260
00:21:47,706 --> 00:21:51,506
That's your father, isn't it?
A good man, a hoIy man...

261
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:53,268
...but with his head in the cIouds.

262
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:57,141
Some of us here on Earth,
we Iike a IittIe Iuxury now and then.

263
00:21:58,016 --> 00:22:02,043
Okay. Put your shouIders down.
You're a pretty girI.

264
00:22:02,254 --> 00:22:06,816
Neck, 1 4 and a haIf.
Chest, 33 and a haIf. Waist, 31 .

265
00:22:07,059 --> 00:22:09,892
-Hips, 36 and a haIf.
-What? That's so big.

266
00:22:10,128 --> 00:22:12,722
I know. I thought you'd be
smaIIer than EiIeen.

267
00:22:13,432 --> 00:22:15,297
Congratulations,
you're in the running...

268
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,832
-...for America's Next Top ModeI.
-Thank you.

269
00:22:18,036 --> 00:22:21,494
The next name that
I'm going to call, Christina.

270
00:22:21,707 --> 00:22:23,834
Jasiel, how many tamaIes
do you want?

271
00:22:24,109 --> 00:22:25,235
Three.

272
00:22:25,444 --> 00:22:26,843
And you, Magdalena?

273
00:22:27,045 --> 00:22:28,774
It's okay, Mom. I'm not hungry.

274
00:22:29,214 --> 00:22:32,411
You learned a new trick today.
Congratulations.

275
00:22:33,552 --> 00:22:36,419
Here, Joey, here, Arthur.

276
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:46,789
Don't you want to take a jacket?
It's coId out.

277
00:22:46,998 --> 00:22:49,626
No. I'm not going far.

278
00:22:49,835 --> 00:22:51,462
Okay.

279
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:54,867
Here, Joey. Here you go.

280
00:23:12,391 --> 00:23:15,360
-So echinacea....
-Hey.

281
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:19,462
-I toId you before.
-I know. I know.

282
00:23:31,977 --> 00:23:35,879
-So how Iong have you been in L.A.?
-Two weeks.

283
00:23:36,848 --> 00:23:38,941
Hey, dude. What's up?
GIad you couId make it.

284
00:23:39,151 --> 00:23:40,846
-Thanks.
-You want a drink or something?

285
00:23:41,052 --> 00:23:42,952
-Yeah.
-Come on.

286
00:23:51,196 --> 00:23:52,857
Tony, this is Carlos. Carlos, Tony.

287
00:23:53,732 --> 00:23:56,360
-What can I get you?
-Beer's fine.

288
00:24:00,806 --> 00:24:01,932
-Cheers.
-Wow, James.

289
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:03,573
CongratuIations on the new pIace.

290
00:24:03,775 --> 00:24:05,834
Thanks. Come.
I want you to meet some friends.

291
00:24:06,044 --> 00:24:07,534
Carlos, this is Stephen and Simon.

292
00:24:07,746 --> 00:24:09,270
-Hey, Carlos.
-What's going on?

293
00:24:09,481 --> 00:24:12,211
We've been Iooking around here
and when something comes up...

294
00:24:12,484 --> 00:24:14,076
...peopIe are bidding over asking.

295
00:24:14,286 --> 00:24:15,878
I know. This area's hot right now.

296
00:24:16,154 --> 00:24:18,884
It's so hot. We were Iooking at
a pIace a coupIe years ago.

297
00:24:19,357 --> 00:24:21,382
But Stephen was concerned
about the crime.

298
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:23,252
-No, I wasn't.
-Yes, he was.

299
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:26,693
That pIace went back on the market
and doubIed in two years.

300
00:24:26,932 --> 00:24:29,958
Let's hope it keeps up. You have
no idea how much we paid for this.

301
00:24:57,863 --> 00:24:59,330
I'm wasted.

302
00:25:04,436 --> 00:25:05,733
I want you to meet somebody.

303
00:25:05,937 --> 00:25:08,269
Hey, Carlos, this is AIejandro.
AIejandro, Carlos.

304
00:25:08,473 --> 00:25:10,373
-What's up?
-Carlos Iives in the back house.

305
00:25:10,575 --> 00:25:13,169
-Where are the Iimes?
-I'II be right back.

306
00:25:21,052 --> 00:25:22,542
Do you know anyone here?

307
00:25:22,821 --> 00:25:25,847
No one. Just James and Gary.

308
00:25:27,225 --> 00:25:30,353
-They're nice guys.
-Yeah.

309
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:32,360
They Iove their Latin boys.

310
00:25:36,167 --> 00:25:37,225

311
00:25:37,435 --> 00:25:40,268
-Hook it up.

312
00:26:05,931 --> 00:26:09,128

CooI.

00:26:15,674 --> 00:26:17,574
You can zoom in.

316
00:26:18,443 --> 00:26:19,501
I am so fucked up.

317
00:26:23,181 --> 00:26:26,548
-Is that a tattoo?
-Yeah.

318
00:26:29,721 --> 00:26:32,315
-''Travieso''?
-Travieso.

319
00:26:33,058 --> 00:26:34,457
What's that mean?

320
00:26:36,161 --> 00:26:38,686
-It means troubIemaker.
-ReaIIy?

321
00:26:49,007 --> 00:26:50,804
FeeI good?

322
00:26:51,009 --> 00:26:52,533
Sure.

323
00:27:19,904 --> 00:27:22,600
It Iooks Iike the opening
for one of those bad noveIIas.

324
00:27:22,807 --> 00:27:24,638
I know.

325
00:27:27,512 --> 00:27:31,039
-Wow. You have beIIs and everything.
-I know.

326
00:27:33,752 --> 00:27:36,243
May? That's your middIe name?
I didn't know that.

327
00:27:36,454 --> 00:27:39,150
-You know that.
-No.

328
00:27:39,357 --> 00:27:40,551
Wow, that Iooks good.

329
00:27:40,759 --> 00:27:42,522
Is that a cake or a piIIow
or what is it?

330
00:27:43,028 --> 00:27:44,552
Cardboard.

331
00:27:47,198 --> 00:27:48,927
You Iook cute.

332
00:27:50,101 --> 00:27:52,160
You didn't have a tiara
on in your Quincea¨¾era.

333
00:27:52,370 --> 00:27:54,463
I know. I broke it
on the way to church.

334
00:27:54,673 --> 00:27:57,005
-You did?
-Yeah.

335
00:27:57,542 --> 00:28:00,409
-Your hair's cute.
-Thanks.

336
00:28:00,612 --> 00:28:02,546
Those fIowers are nice.

337
00:28:05,083 --> 00:28:08,382
It Iooks Iike you're Iooking for bugs.

338
00:28:08,586 --> 00:28:10,349
It Iooks Iike there is a bug.
You see it?

339
00:28:10,555 --> 00:28:12,546
Oh, yeah. That's right.

340
00:28:12,757 --> 00:28:15,021
Okay, it's not just me.

341
00:28:17,262 --> 00:28:20,163
Oh, the dress.

342
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:27,971
That was cute.

343
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:32,407
It wouId heIp if you actuaIIy
appIied it on your face.

344
00:28:33,311 --> 00:28:34,778
She's putting it on the air.

345
00:28:34,979 --> 00:28:37,709
-She has her whoIe face on.
-Her faciaI expression is Iike....

346
00:28:37,916 --> 00:28:40,544
-You do not need more Iip gIoss.
-Oh, I know.

347
00:28:40,752 --> 00:28:42,686
Lips aII shiny.

348
00:28:42,887 --> 00:28:45,583
So pretty.

349
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:47,849
Tia Silvia Iooks pissed.

350
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:51,119
I can't teII if she's gonna cry or smack
the crap out of you.

351
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:01,402
-Your dress is reaIIy pretty.
-Thanks.

352
00:29:01,606 --> 00:29:03,597
My mom's supposed to aIter it
for Magdalena.

353
00:29:03,808 --> 00:29:05,639
Aren't you the same size?

354
00:29:05,844 --> 00:29:08,904
AImost. She just has
to take it out a IittIe bit.

355
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:21,085
In history they're signing up peopIe
for a trip to Germany next spring.

356
00:29:21,359 --> 00:29:24,419
-You gonna go?
-Yeah, if I win the Iottery.

357
00:29:24,629 --> 00:29:26,221
What do you wanna go there for?

358
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:29,059
I wanna see the worId.
I wanna traveI.

359
00:29:29,267 --> 00:29:32,065
I mean, I'm sick of Echo Park.

360
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:34,568
I know every buiIding,
I know every piece of grass.

361
00:29:34,806 --> 00:29:36,637
I'm sick of it too.

362
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:38,906
What's wrong?

363
00:29:39,878 --> 00:29:42,403
-Nothing.
-ReaIIy?

364
00:29:42,614 --> 00:29:45,139
If I teII you, you'II think
I'm stupid and superficiaI.

365
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:47,045
-I won't.
-Yes, you wiII.

366
00:29:47,252 --> 00:29:49,277
Come on. TeII me.

367
00:29:49,487 --> 00:29:51,751
It's my dad. He's being a reaI jerk.

368
00:29:51,956 --> 00:29:55,016
-About the Hummer Iimo?
-Yeah.

369
00:29:56,127 --> 00:29:58,527
-I knew I shouIdn't have toId you.
-It's okay.

370
00:29:58,730 --> 00:30:00,561
I mean, I know it means a Iot to you.

371
00:30:00,765 --> 00:30:02,892
Don't make Iike you understand me.
You don't.

372
00:30:03,101 --> 00:30:04,796
You don't have
to go through this crap.

373
00:30:05,003 --> 00:30:06,265
Okay. I'm sorry.

374
00:30:08,406 --> 00:30:10,772
I'm sorry. I don't mean to be a bitch.

375
00:30:11,342 --> 00:30:13,139
It's okay.

376
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:19,177
Here you go.
Twenty minutes in the oven on 400.

377
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:22,411
Okay. Thanks, Mom.

378
00:30:22,687 --> 00:30:24,985
And I'II be back from work
about midnight.

379
00:30:27,158 --> 00:30:29,353
Before you go,
can I ask you something?

380
00:30:30,094 --> 00:30:32,961
There's this girI, a friend,
her Quincea¨¾era's coming up...

381
00:30:33,164 --> 00:30:36,656
...and I thought maybe UncIe Hector
couId get us a deaI on a Hummer.

382
00:30:36,868 --> 00:30:37,835
Who is this girI?

383
00:30:38,036 --> 00:30:39,901
-Just a friend.
-Oh, reaIIy?

384
00:30:40,104 --> 00:30:43,130
It's not Iike that, Mom.
She's the preacher's daughter.

385
00:30:43,341 --> 00:30:46,037
I don't care
whose daughter she is, mijo.

386
00:30:46,244 --> 00:30:48,804
-You have schooI to think about, okay?
-Okay.

387
00:30:49,614 --> 00:30:52,048
Besides, UncIe Hector,
he just works for the company.

388
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:53,979
He can't set the prices.

389
00:31:14,205 --> 00:31:16,173
Did you see
your friends again tonight?

390
00:31:16,374 --> 00:31:18,672
-Yeah.
-That's nice.

391
00:31:20,511 --> 00:31:22,001
Yeah.

392
00:31:24,816 --> 00:31:26,613
-Hey, Tio.
-Yeah.

393
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:32,621
-Ever think about getting married?
-Yeah.

394
00:31:32,824 --> 00:31:35,224
I've had a coupIe of cIose caIIs.

395
00:31:36,527 --> 00:31:40,122
-Where? Was it here or back in--?
-No, back in Mexico.

396
00:31:40,331 --> 00:31:43,926
There was one. Maria Epifania.

397
00:31:45,069 --> 00:31:48,561
We worked in the same office.
Different fIoors.

398
00:31:48,773 --> 00:31:53,369
I thought about her a Iot.
AII the time.

399
00:31:54,345 --> 00:31:55,437
She Iiked you?

400
00:31:55,647 --> 00:31:57,205
Yeah, I think she did.

401
00:31:57,415 --> 00:32:00,009
-And you Iiked her?
-Oh, yeah.

402
00:32:00,218 --> 00:32:04,951
She was a very sweet,
a very beautifuI girI.

403
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:07,323
What happened?

404
00:32:07,525 --> 00:32:11,723
We saw each other a few times.
But I couIdn't afford very much.

405
00:32:12,196 --> 00:32:16,292
And then my mother become iII.
Very iII.

406
00:32:16,901 --> 00:32:20,735
And I had to move back to the ranch
near TepatitI¨¢n, JaIisco...

407
00:32:20,939 --> 00:32:23,237
...and take care of her.

408
00:32:23,441 --> 00:32:25,136
So I just couIdn't.

409
00:32:29,714 --> 00:32:31,648
Yeah, that's messed up.

410
00:32:31,849 --> 00:32:33,373
Yeah.

411
00:33:14,959 --> 00:33:18,417
I'm teIIing you, these are just the most
rocking tamaIes in Echo Park.

412
00:33:18,629 --> 00:33:20,790
We'II see about that.

413
00:33:21,766 --> 00:33:24,360
Can I put it in the back?
I don't want it to get dirty.

414
00:33:24,569 --> 00:33:26,161
Okay.

415
00:33:30,508 --> 00:33:31,975
You added a Iot of extra fIowers.

416
00:33:32,176 --> 00:33:34,406
No, I didn't. I moved a few around.

417
00:33:34,612 --> 00:33:35,943
It Iooks beautifuI.

418
00:33:42,353 --> 00:33:46,119
Go try it on.
We're aII waiting. Go, go, go.

419
00:33:47,759 --> 00:33:50,626
The amount of work I did on it.

420
00:33:52,697 --> 00:33:54,756
Okay, breathe in.

421
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:57,695
Breathe in.

422
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,299
Oh, it Iooks beautifuI.

423
00:34:06,411 --> 00:34:08,675
But it Iooks a IittIe tight.

424
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,507
I think it needs to be adjusted.

425
00:34:10,715 --> 00:34:11,875
Turn around.

426
00:34:14,018 --> 00:34:15,713
You've gotten
the measurements wrong.

427
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:17,444
I did not.

428
00:34:18,156 --> 00:34:20,818
We'II Iet out the seam
and it wiII be fine.

429
00:34:25,696 --> 00:34:28,722
-Has she been eating a Iot IateIy?
-No.

430
00:34:28,933 --> 00:34:31,800
-Maria, I hope that I'm wrong.
-What?

431
00:34:32,904 --> 00:34:36,601
No one couId've brought up a girI
better than you brought up Magdalena.

432
00:34:36,808 --> 00:34:38,742
-No one.
-Mom.

433
00:34:47,585 --> 00:34:49,519
1 4 years oId.

434
00:35:01,165 --> 00:35:02,894
You'II need an extra bIanket.

435
00:35:09,774 --> 00:35:11,742
It's getting coId tonight.

436
00:35:17,915 --> 00:35:19,405
What?

437
00:35:23,721 --> 00:35:25,484
Have you been with Herman?

438
00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:27,521
No, Mom,
I haven't been with Herman.

439
00:35:27,725 --> 00:35:30,888
-I mean, having reIations with--
-No.

440
00:35:31,095 --> 00:35:32,585
-Or any other boys?
-Mom!

441
00:35:33,331 --> 00:35:35,561
I know. I'm sorry.

442
00:35:41,305 --> 00:35:45,799
When was the Iast time
you had your monthIy visitor?

443
00:36:35,826 --> 00:36:38,761
How couId this happen?
How couId you have Iet this happen?

444
00:36:38,963 --> 00:36:41,090
-I didn't know.
-You knew there was a boy.

445
00:36:41,299 --> 00:36:43,392
Someone she'd mentioned
once or twice.

446
00:36:43,601 --> 00:36:45,193
I didn't think it was anything.

447
00:36:45,403 --> 00:36:47,803
-You kept it from me.
-I didn't think it was important.

448
00:36:48,005 --> 00:36:50,803
Not important! Damn it, woman,
what do you think is important?

449
00:36:51,008 --> 00:36:52,942
Look at the state she is in now!

450
00:36:53,144 --> 00:36:54,736
Papa.

451
00:36:57,448 --> 00:36:58,881
Go away.

452
00:36:59,083 --> 00:37:00,448
It's not what you think.

453
00:37:00,651 --> 00:37:02,346
How do you think
your mother feeIs now?

454
00:37:03,521 --> 00:37:05,682
The shame that you brought
on this house!

455
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:08,017
And on the church.

456
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:10,626
-The test is wrong.
-No, the test is not wrong!

457
00:37:10,828 --> 00:37:11,522
It is!

458
00:37:11,662 --> 00:37:13,960
He that committeth fornication
sinneth against his own body.

459
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:16,530
I'm teIIing you,
I haven't been with a boy!

460
00:37:17,134 --> 00:37:20,968
You Iiar! You are so fuII of sin
that you can't admit the truth.

461
00:37:21,172 --> 00:37:23,868
Not even when your wickedness is
in front of you for the worId to see.

462
00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:25,201
Why aren't you Iistening?

463
00:37:25,409 --> 00:37:27,775
Go to your room.
Let me handIe this.

464
00:37:27,979 --> 00:37:31,005
Go! I don't want to Iook at you!

465
00:38:39,383 --> 00:38:40,850
-Hey.
-What's up?

466
00:38:41,052 --> 00:38:43,646
Nothing. I'm just digging the yard.

467
00:38:43,854 --> 00:38:46,220
-In between jobs.
-Yeah?

468
00:38:46,424 --> 00:38:50,451
Yeah, I work in TV,
so it's feast or famine.

469
00:38:50,661 --> 00:38:51,787
CooI.

470
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:53,854
What are you up to?

471
00:38:54,065 --> 00:38:55,259
Nothing. Just got off work.

472
00:38:55,466 --> 00:38:57,957
-Oh, yeah? Where do you work?
-At the car wash.

473
00:39:01,639 --> 00:39:03,334
So you're from London?

474
00:39:04,308 --> 00:39:05,332
Yes.

475
00:39:05,543 --> 00:39:09,001
-Like this?
-No, it's Iike this:

476
00:39:09,213 --> 00:39:10,771
This one's an E.

477
00:39:11,716 --> 00:39:13,513
This one's a P.

478
00:39:15,486 --> 00:39:18,011
-Echo Parque.
-Echo Parque.

479
00:39:20,091 --> 00:39:22,321
Be carefuI. Don't fIash that
around TempIe Street.

480
00:39:22,526 --> 00:39:25,893
-They're the rivaI gang, right?
-They'd kiII you.

481
00:39:26,097 --> 00:39:29,498
Wow. You reaIIy Iive
in a whoIe other worId, don't you?

482
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:32,635
No. You do.

483
00:39:40,411 --> 00:39:42,072
You know,
we shouId wait for James.

484
00:39:52,189 --> 00:39:54,783
She's fine.

485
00:39:55,126 --> 00:39:57,151
It's no big deaI.

486
00:39:57,361 --> 00:40:01,923
I couIdn't sIeep aII night.
She's my onIy daughter.

487
00:40:02,133 --> 00:40:05,159
But Ernesto.
You know what he's Iike.

488
00:40:05,369 --> 00:40:08,770
He's buII-headed,
but he's a good man.

489
00:40:09,306 --> 00:40:11,740
Give him time
and he'II come around.

490
00:40:12,109 --> 00:40:16,375
And meanwhiIe don't worry.
She's safe with me.

491
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:30,850
Hey, boys.

492
00:40:31,061 --> 00:40:34,155
Come here. Come here, boy.

493
00:40:43,207 --> 00:40:45,539
-Hey.
-Carlos.

494
00:40:45,743 --> 00:40:47,438
I can make tea.
WouId you Iike some?

495
00:40:47,645 --> 00:40:49,806
No, I'm straight.
What's up with you?

496
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:53,307
-Nothing.
-Leave her aIone.

497
00:40:57,955 --> 00:40:59,820
Did you see the boys
pIaying basketbaII today?

498
00:41:00,024 --> 00:41:02,049
-Yes, I did.
-Oh, my gosh.

499
00:41:02,259 --> 00:41:04,352
ManueI had his head shaved.
Did you see?

500
00:41:04,562 --> 00:41:06,086
-What did it Iook Iike?
-HorribIe.

501
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:08,060
It Iooks Iike he has Ieukemia.

502
00:41:08,265 --> 00:41:09,892
I think short hair is sexy.

503
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:12,330
But his head is so weird.
He Iooks Iike E.T.

504
00:41:12,536 --> 00:41:15,334
I think that boy's too skinny.
He needs to put some weight on.

505
00:41:15,573 --> 00:41:17,564
-Hey.
-Hi.

506
00:41:17,775 --> 00:41:18,764
-Hi.
-Hi.

507
00:41:18,976 --> 00:41:21,274
-You ready?
-Yeah.

508
00:41:22,913 --> 00:41:24,380
I'II see you girIs Iater.

509
00:41:24,582 --> 00:41:25,776
Bye.

510
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:32,753
-I Iike them baId. Shaved.
-Some guys can puII it off.

511
00:41:32,957 --> 00:41:34,652
Yeah, weII, that's what I Iike.

512
00:41:36,727 --> 00:41:41,027
So you moved in with your uncIe?
Why did you do that?

513
00:41:41,232 --> 00:41:44,065
It's cIoser to schooI.
It means I can waIk.

514
00:41:44,268 --> 00:41:47,726
-It's not cIoser.
-It is.

515
00:41:47,938 --> 00:41:50,270
Did you get in a fight with your dad?

516
00:41:52,443 --> 00:41:54,673
Was it about the Hummer Iimo?

517
00:41:57,047 --> 00:41:58,571
Come here.

518
00:42:12,029 --> 00:42:13,223
I'm gonna have a baby.

519
00:42:13,430 --> 00:42:14,920
-Yeah, right.
-I am.

520
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:16,223
You can't be.

521
00:42:16,467 --> 00:42:18,435
I did the test. I did it twice.

522
00:42:19,703 --> 00:42:21,603
-Who's the father?
-You.

523
00:42:21,805 --> 00:42:23,864
That's not possibIe.

524
00:42:24,074 --> 00:42:25,666
I know.

525
00:42:26,877 --> 00:42:28,902
-But we never--
-I know that.

526
00:42:31,148 --> 00:42:34,914
But the baby's there and I've never
been with anybody eIse.

527
00:42:38,455 --> 00:42:40,389
You don't beIieve me.

528
00:42:53,170 --> 00:42:56,298
Did you hear that Maria EIena
is moving to SyImar?

529
00:42:56,507 --> 00:42:57,769
Is she moving?

530
00:42:57,975 --> 00:42:59,499
See how much they're asking for?

531
00:43:00,144 --> 00:43:02,044
The neighborhood is sure changing,
isn't it?

532
00:43:02,279 --> 00:43:03,610
So fast.

533
00:43:03,814 --> 00:43:05,577
Here you are.

534
00:43:18,162 --> 00:43:19,925
Carlos, get your feet off the sofa.

535
00:43:20,197 --> 00:43:22,893
-It's my house. I can do what I want.
-It's my house now too.

536
00:43:23,133 --> 00:43:24,259
Fuck you.

537
00:43:24,501 --> 00:43:26,594
I have to sIeep there
and your boots are dirty.

538
00:43:26,804 --> 00:43:28,294
So?

539
00:43:52,963 --> 00:43:54,294
I know why you're here.

540
00:43:54,498 --> 00:43:56,489
And I'm sorry you wasted your time.

541
00:43:56,700 --> 00:44:02,229
I just think you two shouId taIk.

542
00:44:02,439 --> 00:44:05,465
When she's ready to confess her sin,
I'II taIk. Not untiI then.

543
00:44:05,843 --> 00:44:09,779
Magdalena is very strong-headed.
You know what she's Iike.

544
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:11,948
I used to know her.

545
00:44:12,916 --> 00:44:16,010
She's stiII the same.

546
00:44:16,587 --> 00:44:22,321
The girI I knew read the BibIe at night
and sang in my church.

547
00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:26,427
She didn't run around with boys
and fornicate.

548
00:44:26,630 --> 00:44:29,098
She didn't Iie to her father.

549
00:44:29,299 --> 00:44:31,790
I don't think she's a Iiar.

550
00:44:32,002 --> 00:44:34,800
It's true, Ernesto. She doesn't Iie.

551
00:44:35,005 --> 00:44:38,236
A girI who hasn't been with a man
doesn't end up with a baby. Period.

552
00:45:23,353 --> 00:45:24,320
You're a Ioser.

553
00:45:24,521 --> 00:45:26,614
Smoking pot in the afternoon,
watching cartoons.

554
00:45:26,824 --> 00:45:30,089
Look who's taIking,
1 4 and pregnant.

555
00:45:30,661 --> 00:45:33,630
Face it. Your Iife is over.

556
00:45:33,897 --> 00:45:34,921
No, it isn't.

557
00:45:35,132 --> 00:45:39,193
I'm gonna have my baby, go to schooI,
do everything I pIanned to do anyway.

558
00:45:39,403 --> 00:45:41,098
Good Iuck.

559
00:45:43,607 --> 00:45:46,599
-Want a hit?
-No.

560
00:45:58,088 --> 00:45:59,612
Nobody beIieves you, huh?

561
00:45:59,823 --> 00:46:02,257
-About what?
-About what? Come on.

562
00:46:03,794 --> 00:46:05,056
No.

563
00:46:05,262 --> 00:46:06,957
Nobody beIieved me
about anything.

564
00:46:07,164 --> 00:46:10,292
That's because you're a Iiar,
and a thief, and a pothead, and a gay.

565
00:46:10,501 --> 00:46:12,128
So?

566
00:46:18,208 --> 00:46:20,938
I read some stuff on the Internet.
Why don't you check it out?

567
00:46:21,145 --> 00:46:22,112
What stuff?

568
00:46:22,312 --> 00:46:24,837
Oh, you know. Sex advice.

569
00:46:25,048 --> 00:46:27,175
I don't need no sex advice.

570
00:46:27,384 --> 00:46:29,215
Just trying to heIp.

571
00:46:48,972 --> 00:46:51,406
''Is there any way to get pregnant
if the man's sperm...

572
00:46:51,608 --> 00:46:54,475
...gets onto the outside of the vagina
but not inside?

573
00:46:54,678 --> 00:46:56,703
Signed, Pregnant Virgin.''

574
00:46:56,914 --> 00:46:57,938
''Dear Pregnant Virgin.

575
00:46:58,148 --> 00:46:59,740
Sperm are very determined beings...

576
00:46:59,950 --> 00:47:03,852
...whose soIe reason to exist
is to get inside the faIIopian tubes.

577
00:47:04,054 --> 00:47:06,420
Whenever sperm is sprayed near
the vaginaI opening...

578
00:47:06,623 --> 00:47:08,784
...there is a chance
that they couId swim inside.''

579
00:47:08,992 --> 00:47:10,516
-See?
-Fuck.

580
00:47:10,727 --> 00:47:13,252
-You stiII think it's someone eIse's?
-I never did.

581
00:47:13,463 --> 00:47:16,955
I mean, it's just weird, that's aII.

582
00:47:17,167 --> 00:47:18,964
-What are the chances?
-I don't know.

583
00:47:21,205 --> 00:47:23,230
My sperm must be
pretty strong swimmers, huh?

584
00:47:23,540 --> 00:47:24,700
Shut up.

585
00:47:24,908 --> 00:47:28,935
-I mean, I onIy came on your Ieg.
-Herman, stop.

586
00:47:30,247 --> 00:47:32,147
Did you show this to your dad?

587
00:47:33,383 --> 00:47:34,714
Why not?

588
00:47:34,918 --> 00:47:37,648
And Iet him know how far we did go?
Yeah, he'd Iove that.

589
00:47:40,657 --> 00:47:43,217
-Hey.
-What?

590
00:47:43,427 --> 00:47:45,520
If he's a boy, we can caII him Jesus.

591
00:47:47,264 --> 00:47:48,253
Yeah.

592
00:47:48,465 --> 00:47:51,992
-I'm sure he'II be a great kid.
-Or she.

593
00:47:53,503 --> 00:47:56,301
We can make him a papoose
and take him traveIing with us.

594
00:48:00,210 --> 00:48:01,700
Come here.

595
00:48:11,922 --> 00:48:13,617
What are you doing Iater?

596
00:48:13,824 --> 00:48:16,816
Nothing. Got the day off.

597
00:48:17,594 --> 00:48:19,357
Want some?

598
00:48:19,563 --> 00:48:23,795
There's no smoking in the house.
It's the ruIe. It's not my ruIe.

599
00:48:24,001 --> 00:48:25,263
Okay.

600
00:48:27,905 --> 00:48:30,100
How Iong you guys been together?

601
00:48:30,474 --> 00:48:35,138
About five years now,
with six months off for good behavior.

602
00:48:35,345 --> 00:48:36,607
You guys spIit up?

603
00:48:36,813 --> 00:48:41,841
Yeah, about two years ago.
Then got back together again.

604
00:48:43,453 --> 00:48:45,182
You guys cooI?

605
00:48:46,356 --> 00:48:49,951
I don't know.
It's Iike we're so different.

606
00:48:50,594 --> 00:48:52,152
I'm spontaneous...

607
00:48:52,362 --> 00:48:55,388
...and he Iikes to pIan things
two months in advance, you know?

608
00:48:55,832 --> 00:49:00,769
He's so dependent. Must be
the age difference or something.

609
00:49:01,939 --> 00:49:03,907
He's oIder than you?

610
00:49:04,107 --> 00:49:09,101
Yeah, Iike six years oIder than me.
You ass.

611
00:49:12,649 --> 00:49:14,310
I gotta go.

612
00:49:16,086 --> 00:49:18,384
I shouIdn't be taIking about
age difference with you.

613
00:49:18,588 --> 00:49:20,488
I'm Iike nine years oIder
or something?

614
00:49:20,724 --> 00:49:22,316
Ten.

615
00:49:24,328 --> 00:49:26,421
I don't reaIIy think about it, though.

616
00:49:26,863 --> 00:49:28,490
Neither do I.

617
00:49:45,882 --> 00:49:47,645
AII right.

618
00:49:51,321 --> 00:49:52,811
HoId on, hoId on.

619
00:49:53,790 --> 00:49:55,223
HeIIo?

620
00:49:55,425 --> 00:49:57,393
-It went out.
-It's a dud.

621
00:49:57,594 --> 00:50:02,088
-Hey, come back! It's Iit.
-Come back, come back.

622
00:50:02,299 --> 00:50:04,290
Cinco de Mayo!

623
00:50:04,801 --> 00:50:07,065
Cinco de Mayo.

624
00:50:11,241 --> 00:50:13,141
Yo, I'II be right back.

625
00:50:15,612 --> 00:50:17,512
Let me show you something.

626
00:50:20,550 --> 00:50:22,040
Who do you think they are?

627
00:50:22,252 --> 00:50:23,219
I don't know.

628
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:26,712
-That's your mother and Aunt Silvia.
-No way.

629
00:50:26,923 --> 00:50:29,983
It was taken out here in the yard,
when I just moved in.

630
00:50:30,193 --> 00:50:32,024
There was nothing here
but burnt grass.

631
00:50:32,229 --> 00:50:33,992
That's crazy.

632
00:50:36,233 --> 00:50:38,224
-Who's that?
-That was my mother.

633
00:50:38,435 --> 00:50:40,494
Your great-great-grandmother.

634
00:50:40,737 --> 00:50:41,829
She's beautifuI.

635
00:50:42,072 --> 00:50:45,906
DoIores AnguIo.
She had 22 chiIdren.

636
00:50:46,109 --> 00:50:49,909
-He was the 1 3th.
-Yup. My Iucky number.

637
00:50:50,113 --> 00:50:52,445
Let me show you
some of my brothers.

638
00:50:55,252 --> 00:51:01,714
That's Chuy, and AIberto,
and Paco and....

639
00:51:02,392 --> 00:51:05,418
I forgot his name.
Oh, God, what's his name?

640
00:51:05,629 --> 00:51:07,358
Jorge!

641
00:51:08,765 --> 00:51:10,096
Sorry about that, Jorge.

642
00:51:10,300 --> 00:51:12,359
-And that's you?
-Yes.

643
00:51:12,569 --> 00:51:14,127
Why is your Ieg in a cast?

644
00:51:14,337 --> 00:51:16,396
He was in a cast for two years.

645
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:20,038
He Iaid down behind a truck
and tried to off himseIf.

646
00:51:20,243 --> 00:51:21,904
-Carlos.
-It's true.

647
00:51:22,345 --> 00:51:24,609
-It's true.
-ReaIIy?

648
00:51:24,815 --> 00:51:25,907
Yeah.

649
00:51:26,950 --> 00:51:32,217
When I was 9 years oId, I decided
I didn't want any more of this Iife.

650
00:51:32,923 --> 00:51:35,414
I wanted to come back
as someone eIse.

651
00:51:35,792 --> 00:51:39,888
So I hide behind
the back wheeIs of a truck...

652
00:51:40,197 --> 00:51:41,562
...and waited for it to start.

653
00:51:41,765 --> 00:51:44,063
-It ran you over?
-It did.

654
00:51:44,267 --> 00:51:46,098
I wasn't supposed to Iive.

655
00:51:46,303 --> 00:51:49,864
I spent months and months
in the hospitaI.

656
00:51:50,540 --> 00:51:56,137
And it was a Iong time before
I couId see or eat or waIk.

657
00:51:57,147 --> 00:51:59,775
In a way, I got what I wanted.

658
00:52:00,550 --> 00:52:04,350
I came back as a different person
after aII that.

659
00:52:05,055 --> 00:52:07,455
Don't you ever try it, though.

660
00:52:24,407 --> 00:52:26,637
-Got a date?
-Yeah, right.

661
00:52:26,843 --> 00:52:29,744
-Who with?
-None of your business, hood rat.

662
00:52:31,715 --> 00:52:33,876
What do you do
with those guys anyway?

663
00:52:35,085 --> 00:52:36,814
You embarrassed or something?

664
00:52:37,020 --> 00:52:39,989
-No.
-So?

665
00:52:41,191 --> 00:52:42,419
What do you think we do?

666
00:52:42,826 --> 00:52:44,521
I don't know.
I'm a virgin, remember?

667
00:52:44,728 --> 00:52:45,786
Yeah, right.

668
00:52:45,996 --> 00:52:48,487
Come on, Carlos. I toId you stuff.

669
00:52:49,232 --> 00:52:51,097
We mess around, aII right?

670
00:52:51,301 --> 00:52:53,326
Are you the peanut butter
in the sandwich?

671
00:52:53,537 --> 00:52:54,504
Fuck you.

672
00:52:55,038 --> 00:52:57,529
-Do you Iike both of them the same?
-No.

673
00:52:57,874 --> 00:53:00,172
-The young one's better Iooking.
-Yeah. Gary.

674
00:53:01,545 --> 00:53:04,139
-What do you mean?
-Nothing.

675
00:53:06,116 --> 00:53:07,811
Have you done
that kind of thing a Iot?

676
00:53:08,018 --> 00:53:09,178
First time.

677
00:53:09,452 --> 00:53:12,649
-First time with two?
-No, first time ever.

678
00:53:12,856 --> 00:53:16,314
Yeah? I thought UncIe Walter
caught you with some boy?

679
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:20,018
What? Is that what EiIeen toId you?

680
00:53:20,697 --> 00:53:23,359
He tracked this site
I used to go to on the Internet.

681
00:53:23,567 --> 00:53:27,503
-What?
-Yeah. Fucked up, huh?

682
00:53:56,166 --> 00:53:58,794
-You're getting big.
-You mean fat.

683
00:53:59,002 --> 00:54:00,333
Come on. Don't be Iike that.

684
00:54:00,537 --> 00:54:03,404
-You don't Iike it, do you?
-Of course I do.

685
00:54:03,607 --> 00:54:06,201
-What are you up to this weekend?
-Not much. You?

686
00:54:06,643 --> 00:54:09,043
It's kind of crazy.
Saturday, I got my AP History exam.

687
00:54:09,246 --> 00:54:12,909
Saturday night's my mom's birthday.
I'm taking her out to dinner.

688
00:54:13,116 --> 00:54:14,413
Have you toId her yet?

689
00:54:14,618 --> 00:54:18,054
No. I keep waiting for the right time.

690
00:54:18,588 --> 00:54:20,920
I want to teII her after her birthday.

691
00:54:21,925 --> 00:54:23,688
WeII, I gotta get going.

692
00:54:30,767 --> 00:54:32,098
Hey.

693
00:54:33,136 --> 00:54:35,604
We're having a barbecue
over at my house on Sunday.

694
00:54:35,872 --> 00:54:40,400
Just some friends, reIatives and stuff.
You wanna come?

695
00:54:40,610 --> 00:54:42,441
Yeah. If you want me to.

00:55:34,097 --> 00:55:35,689

00:55:36,666 --> 00:55:40,033

-No, not yet. I'm aII right, thanks.

702
00:55:40,236 --> 00:55:42,704
-We forgot the hamburger buns.
-I thought we had some.

703
00:55:42,906 --> 00:55:45,500
Just two packs. And peopIe

704
00:55:45,709 --> 00:55:47,802
-I'II go get some.
-Okay then.

705
00:55:48,011 --> 00:55:50,411

00:55:55,018 --> 00:55:56,679
Excuse me.

709
00:56:00,256 --> 00:56:03,191
-Does she know?
-Yeah.

-ReaIIy?
-WeII, sort of.

711
00:56:07,430 --> 00:56:09,421
What's that supposed to mean?

712
00:56:10,066 --> 00:56:12,660
She knows about you,
that you're pregnant.

713
00:56:13,236 --> 00:56:15,830
-And?
-What?

You don't understand.
You don't know her Iike I do.

717
00:56:24,481 --> 00:56:28,144
She has aII these dreams
and expectations of me.

718
00:56:29,719 --> 00:56:32,347
-I think I'm gonna go home.
-No, wait.

719
00:56:33,089 --> 00:56:35,114
Go to the store with me.

00:57:05,722 --> 00:57:08,088

00:57:08,291 --> 00:57:10,919

737
00:58:05,415 --> 00:58:06,882
Gary.

738
00:58:07,350 --> 00:58:10,217
You scared me. What's up?

739
00:58:10,420 --> 00:58:12,047

00:58:28,238 --> 00:58:30,433
-His rhymes are sick.
-I know. I Iove LiI Rob.

745
00:58:33,776 --> 00:58:35,539

Shit. I'II take it back.

747
00:58:40,817 --> 00:58:42,614
Carlos, wait.

748
00:58:50,059 --> 00:58:55,497
The cellular number you are trying
to reach is no longer in service.

749
00:59:02,472 --> 00:59:05,168
The cellular number
you are trying to reach--

750
00:59:13,816 --> 00:59:15,477
-Yes?
-HeIIo. Is Herman home?

751
00:59:15,685 --> 00:59:17,744
-No, he's not here.
-Where did he go?

752
00:59:17,954 --> 00:59:20,650
-He's out of town with reIatives.
-I need to taIk to him.

753
00:59:20,857 --> 00:59:24,020
Listen. Herman
is a straight-A student.

754
00:59:24,227 --> 00:59:27,424
He's going to finish schooI
and go to coIIege to study medicine.

755
00:59:27,630 --> 00:59:29,598
He doesn't have time for this.

756
00:59:29,799 --> 00:59:31,426
Sorry about the state you're in...

757
00:59:31,634 --> 00:59:34,159
...but he gave me his word
he didn't do anything with you.

758
00:59:34,370 --> 00:59:37,032
Take the probIem to the person
who is responsibIe.

759
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:40,141
-Herman is responsibIe.

Hey, it's James.

762
01:00:42,672 --> 01:00:46,039
Oh, it sounds fun. I'd Iove to,

771
01:01:35,825 --> 01:01:38,089

on this $3200 fucking house.

772
01:01:38,327 --> 01:01:40,693
MeanwhiIe, you've had 1 2 hours
to fuck the neighbor.

773
01:01:40,897 --> 01:01:43,525
I'm tired of hearing you taIk
about the fucking mortgage.

774
01:01:43,766 --> 01:01:45,028
We had ruIes about this shit.

775
01:01:45,301 --> 01:01:47,166
This is not the same as before.

776
01:01:47,403 --> 01:01:51,464
It is! Our ruIes were
if we have 3-ways, we're both there.

777
01:01:51,874 --> 01:01:54,775
Otherwise, if I'm at work in my office,
that's cheating.

778
01:01:55,078 --> 01:01:56,238
Let's not do this.

779
01:01:56,446 --> 01:01:59,643
Do what? You're the one who's,
Iike, cheating aII the fucking time.

780
01:01:59,882 --> 01:02:02,851
I'm not cheating aII the time. Why
do you keep accusing me of that?

781
01:02:03,086 --> 01:02:07,284
-What, are you Iove with him?
-No, I'm not in Iove with him.

782
01:02:07,590 --> 01:02:12,027
AII right? He's just some kid.
I'm in Iove with you.

783
01:03:02,245 --> 01:03:04,372
Didn't you notice
how big she was getting...

784
01:03:04,614 --> 01:03:06,707
...when she wouIdn't
get changed for basketbaII?

785
01:03:06,916 --> 01:03:08,611
I heard that Herman moved
to San Diego.

786
01:03:08,885 --> 01:03:10,910
Imagine having to Ieave town
because of her.

787
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:12,815
This couId've happened
to any of us.

788
01:03:13,022 --> 01:03:14,956
I know how cIose
I've come with Paco.

789
01:03:15,224 --> 01:03:17,886
But at Ieast some of us are
smart enough to take precautions.

790
01:03:18,094 --> 01:03:19,083
HeIIo? Birth controI.

791
01:03:19,295 --> 01:03:20,853
How far have you gone with ManueI?

792
01:03:21,097 --> 01:03:24,066
At Ieast I'm not cIaiming to be a virgin
when I'm carrying a baby.

793
01:03:24,267 --> 01:03:25,757
-Is that what she's saying?
-Yes.

794
01:03:25,968 --> 01:03:27,936
HaiI Mary, fuII of grace....

795
01:03:30,606 --> 01:03:32,699
Hey, Magdalena.

796
01:03:38,080 --> 01:03:41,311
You don't want to do that.
Not unIess you have to.

797
01:03:41,584 --> 01:03:43,017
What age did you Ieave schooI?

798
01:03:43,219 --> 01:03:45,483
-When I was 1 2.
-WeII....

799
01:03:45,688 --> 01:03:49,454
That was the way it was.
We have to work for a Iiving.

800
01:03:49,659 --> 01:03:52,685
But I hate it right now, though.
I hate schooI. I hate Herman.

801
01:03:52,895 --> 01:03:54,988
I hate this baby.

802
01:03:56,332 --> 01:03:59,267
Don't Ieave schooI.
You wiII end up as menso as me.

803
01:03:59,468 --> 01:04:00,958
You got a Ietter.

804
01:04:02,205 --> 01:04:04,332
-Did you remember the toiIet paper?
-No.

805
01:04:04,540 --> 01:04:06,974
-I knew you wouIdn't.
-Then why did you ask?

806
01:04:08,544 --> 01:04:10,307
Is it in EngIish, Tio?

807
01:04:12,548 --> 01:04:14,778
It's from a Iawyer.

808
01:04:15,451 --> 01:04:18,750
''Pursuant to your Iease of the rear unit
at 1 023 WaterIoo Street...

809
01:04:18,988 --> 01:04:22,151
...you are hereby given
30 days notice of eviction.

810
01:04:22,358 --> 01:04:25,555
You wiII be expected to vacate
the premises by June 30, 2005.''

811
01:04:25,761 --> 01:04:27,592
What's the matter?

812
01:04:29,565 --> 01:04:32,033
Tio, they want us to Ieave.

813
01:04:32,235 --> 01:04:33,668
The motherfuckers!

814
01:04:33,870 --> 01:04:37,499
They want us to Ieave? Why?

815
01:04:47,516 --> 01:04:48,710
Hey, puto!

816
01:04:50,386 --> 01:04:52,616
Hey, puto, come out here, man!

817
01:04:52,822 --> 01:04:53,846
Fucking evict me, bitch?

818
01:04:56,459 --> 01:05:00,520
Get the fuck out here, puto!
What, are you fucking scared now?

819
01:05:00,730 --> 01:05:05,599
Hey, puto! Get the fuck out here!
Fucking punk!

820
01:05:08,537 --> 01:05:11,563
I toId him you were from JaIisco
and guess what?

821
01:05:11,874 --> 01:05:13,967
There's someone on the same fIoor
from there too.

822
01:05:14,210 --> 01:05:15,802
You aII right with these steps?

823
01:05:16,045 --> 01:05:17,205
-It's good.
-He's fine.

824
01:05:17,446 --> 01:05:19,607
Wasn't there anything
on the ground fIoor?

825
01:05:19,815 --> 01:05:21,112
You heard the IandIord.

826
01:05:21,317 --> 01:05:23,911
The eIevator's gonna be
working again tomorrow.

827
01:05:24,120 --> 01:05:27,385
-It's not a probIem. Right, Tio?
-No probIem.

828
01:05:34,463 --> 01:05:37,830
It's not bad. It's not bad at aII.

829
01:05:38,034 --> 01:05:40,093
Look, you have a nice big window.

830
01:05:40,303 --> 01:05:43,363
I'II fix you curtains. Buttercup yeIIow,
to make it more cheerfuI.

831
01:05:46,309 --> 01:05:47,503
Needs a new coat of paint.

832
01:05:47,743 --> 01:05:50,940
WeII, you can do that for him.
It'II take you aII of a day.

833
01:05:51,147 --> 01:05:54,139
Tio, we're gonna have to put some
of your stuff in storage...

834
01:05:54,350 --> 01:05:58,309
...but I think it wiII be good
to go through some of your things.

835
01:06:04,727 --> 01:06:08,288
I aIways teII my friends what a gentIe
man he is, what a sweet man.

836
01:06:08,597 --> 01:06:10,792
Who knew
he couId be so stubborn?

837
01:06:11,300 --> 01:06:13,632
Nothing we show him is
good enough. Nothing.

838
01:06:13,836 --> 01:06:16,304
And when you try to taIk about it,
he just doesn't hear.

839
01:06:17,239 --> 01:06:19,707
He wouIdn't even Iook at the one
Ernesto found for him.

840
01:06:19,909 --> 01:06:21,206
You see?

841
01:06:21,410 --> 01:06:24,846
But think how hard it must be.

842
01:06:25,047 --> 01:06:26,105
Twenty-eight years.

843
01:06:26,315 --> 01:06:28,909
I've never been more
than five years in one home.

844
01:06:29,118 --> 01:06:32,679
That's you. You aIways
want something bigger.

845
01:06:32,888 --> 01:06:37,348
I don't know how he's going
to sort through everything.

846
01:06:37,560 --> 01:06:39,960
And then there are the dogs.

847
01:06:40,162 --> 01:06:42,494
And Carlos, and Magdalena.

848
01:07:36,585 --> 01:07:38,018
Hey.

849
01:07:40,890 --> 01:07:41,879
You coId?

850
01:07:42,191 --> 01:07:44,853
-No.
-Then what?

851
01:07:45,061 --> 01:07:47,689
None of my cIothes
fit me anymore.

852
01:07:50,533 --> 01:07:52,626
Can't you get your foIks
to give you some money?

853
01:07:52,835 --> 01:07:54,200
No.

854
01:07:55,638 --> 01:07:59,165
-If you toId them what happened--
-Why shouId that be so important?

855
01:07:59,375 --> 01:08:01,343
So they couId hoId their heads up
in church?

856
01:08:01,544 --> 01:08:05,412
So I can be a good girI again?
It's so stupid.

857
01:08:07,016 --> 01:08:08,779
I've got a shirt.

858
01:08:08,984 --> 01:08:13,546
-I don't want your smeIIy shirts.
-It's extra Iarge. It's brand new.

859
01:08:42,184 --> 01:08:45,153
HOUSE FOR RENT
2 BEDROOMS-BACKHOUSE NICE!

860
01:08:45,888 --> 01:08:50,120
We re-did aII the ceiIings,
got rid of the cottage cheese.

861
01:08:50,326 --> 01:08:51,725
FIoors are refinished.

862
01:08:51,927 --> 01:08:54,987
The appIiances are new.
Cupboards are new.

863
01:08:55,197 --> 01:08:59,065
And that's Travertine tiIe.
My partner put it in herseIf.

864
01:08:59,268 --> 01:09:00,895
It's beautifuI.

865
01:09:01,504 --> 01:09:03,472
And you say it's just you
and your uncIe.

866
01:09:03,672 --> 01:09:06,232
-No, there are three of us.
-It might be cramped for three.

867
01:09:06,475 --> 01:09:08,136
It's fine. Do you take pets?

868
01:09:08,444 --> 01:09:11,641
If it's nice feIIas Iike those guys,
no probIem.

869
01:09:12,114 --> 01:09:13,547
Great.

870
01:09:14,583 --> 01:09:16,050
It's $ 1 600 a month.

871
01:09:18,087 --> 01:09:19,213
Wow.

872
01:09:19,421 --> 01:09:23,016
Sorry, but we've put
a Iot of money into it.

873
01:09:23,225 --> 01:09:25,125
That's what I figured.

874
01:09:31,433 --> 01:09:34,630
-You're not gonna make champurrado?
-Not today.

875
01:09:42,511 --> 01:09:44,103
Wait tiII Iater. I'II heIp you out.

876
01:09:44,313 --> 01:09:45,871
No, don't worry.

877
01:09:47,216 --> 01:09:49,548
Okay. See you Iater.

878
01:10:00,396 --> 01:10:03,695
Yeah, so he came, hit me,
did a hit and run...

879
01:10:03,899 --> 01:10:05,628
...damaged this part, dented this.

880
01:10:05,834 --> 01:10:08,860
I have to repIace this and this.
I don't know how I'm gonna do it.

881
01:10:09,205 --> 01:10:11,935
Don't even worry about it.
I got a guy who'II take care of it.

882
01:10:12,408 --> 01:10:15,434
-Carlos, go do the Mustang.
-It's gonna be hard to take care of.

883
01:10:15,644 --> 01:10:17,942
-Let me show you what we got.
-Okay.

884
01:10:22,251 --> 01:10:24,219
It was just what we needed.

885
01:10:24,420 --> 01:10:27,446
Yeah, we just Iaid around,
went shopping a IittIe.

886
01:10:27,656 --> 01:10:29,021
No, I Iove PaIm Springs too.

887
01:10:41,770 --> 01:10:45,137
It's better now. Gary seems happier.
He's starting a new job.

888
01:10:45,341 --> 01:10:47,639
Yeah, he just--
He had too much time on his hands.

889
01:10:52,381 --> 01:10:55,646
What the fuck
are you doing, Carlos?

890
01:10:56,552 --> 01:10:58,486
Get him.

891
01:11:08,964 --> 01:11:11,831
Hey. What happened?

892
01:11:12,034 --> 01:11:14,764
-Did you get into another fight?
-Yeah.

893
01:11:14,970 --> 01:11:16,562
I'II get some iodine.

894
01:11:16,772 --> 01:11:18,763
Here. Sit down.
I'II put some ice on it.

895
01:11:30,085 --> 01:11:32,110
You idiot.

896
01:11:32,621 --> 01:11:35,454
-I Iost my job.
-Great.

897
01:11:35,658 --> 01:11:39,287
I needed to get out of there, anyway.
Shitty job.

898
01:11:39,495 --> 01:11:42,589
-I thought it was your chosen career.
-Shut up.

899
01:11:43,399 --> 01:11:46,926
I'm getting a reaI job in TV as a PA.

900
01:11:47,136 --> 01:11:48,160
With your boyfriend?

901
01:11:48,370 --> 01:11:50,361
-Fuck you.
-HoId stiII.

902
01:11:54,777 --> 01:11:58,110
I'm gonna have to make more money
if we're gonna get a new pIace.

903
01:12:01,417 --> 01:12:05,717
I've been thinking.
Herman's not coming back.

904
01:12:07,189 --> 01:12:09,714
Someone's gotta take care of that kid
and be a father to him.

905
01:12:09,925 --> 01:12:11,324
Might as weII be me.

906
01:12:13,195 --> 01:12:14,753
I'm gonna get a reaI job.

907
01:12:15,764 --> 01:12:18,528
One that's not
a totaI fucking dead-end.

908
01:12:20,869 --> 01:12:24,430
And you can stay in schooI,
and Tio Tomas can babysit.

909
01:12:24,640 --> 01:12:27,575
-Yeah, right.
-I'm serious.

910
01:12:41,156 --> 01:12:43,624
Yes, I'm caIIing about
the apartment.

911
01:12:44,793 --> 01:12:47,626
Oh, that's too bad.
Yes. AII right, thanks.

912
01:12:59,074 --> 01:13:02,635
I know. I know. It's unbeIievabIe.
HoId on. HoId on.

913
01:13:02,845 --> 01:13:04,642
I caIIed about the apartment.

914
01:13:04,847 --> 01:13:06,542
Sorry, it's just been rented.

915
01:13:09,084 --> 01:13:11,678
-How oId are you?
-AImost 1 5.

916
01:13:11,887 --> 01:13:14,651
-And how oId is your uncIe?
-Eighty-five.

917
01:13:14,857 --> 01:13:17,451
I don't think
it's gonna work out, chica.

918
01:13:20,896 --> 01:13:24,263
The front unit's aIready been taken,
but there's a pIace in the back.

919
01:13:24,466 --> 01:13:26,525
I can Iet you have it for 400.

920
01:13:38,580 --> 01:13:41,674
Look. I gotta think
about the doIIars and cents here.

921
01:13:41,884 --> 01:13:45,115
I have appIications from quaIified
professionaIs who want to rent it.

922
01:13:45,320 --> 01:13:47,413
The whoIe neighborhood
is the same.

923
01:13:47,623 --> 01:13:51,320
Everyone who moves in
is, weII, white.

924
01:13:53,061 --> 01:13:54,392
Does he work, your uncIe?

925
01:13:54,997 --> 01:13:57,056
Not reaIIy. He seIIs champurrado.

926
01:13:57,266 --> 01:14:01,327
That IittIe guy with the cIown's horn?
My God, is he stiII around?

927
01:14:01,537 --> 01:14:03,698
Yeah, he's doing great.

928
01:14:03,906 --> 01:14:07,239
He gave me free champurrado once.
I don't beIieve this.

929
01:14:11,613 --> 01:14:15,845
Apart from a great sense of continuity
with the past, what eIse is there?

930
01:14:16,051 --> 01:14:18,076
-You mean money?
-Yeah.

931
01:14:18,287 --> 01:14:21,723
The stuff that doesn't grow on trees,
makes the worId go around.

932
01:14:21,924 --> 01:14:23,949
WeII, Carlos is unempIoyed
right now...

933
01:14:24,159 --> 01:14:28,152
...but he's angIing for a job in TV
that pays reaIIy, reaIIy weII.

934
01:14:28,363 --> 01:14:31,890
But Iook, if he does your gardening,
that saves you a $ 1 00 a month.

935
01:14:32,100 --> 01:14:35,228
I can cIean your house. That'II
save you another $ 1 00 a month.

936
01:14:55,757 --> 01:14:57,884
Carlos.

937
01:15:39,167 --> 01:15:41,032
What's going on?

938
01:15:41,236 --> 01:15:44,467
-It's Tio Tomas.
-What?

939
01:15:44,673 --> 01:15:47,608
He passed. PeacefuIIy.

940
01:15:48,944 --> 01:15:51,003
They took him away.

941
01:17:02,651 --> 01:17:06,382
Look. The tangerine tree.

942
01:17:06,688 --> 01:17:08,656
Remember how sweet
the juice was?

943
01:17:08,890 --> 01:17:11,654
I cried when they had
to chop it down.

944
01:17:15,097 --> 01:17:17,327
Is that Aunt Lucia there?

945
01:17:17,966 --> 01:17:20,434
Yeah. But who's
that woman with her?

946
01:17:20,636 --> 01:17:22,433
I don't know.

947
01:17:25,374 --> 01:17:28,138
He had a Iong, happy Iife,
and in the end he didn't suffer.

948
01:17:28,343 --> 01:17:30,504
It's the way he wouId have wanted it.

949
01:17:31,480 --> 01:17:36,349
-He didn't want to move from here.
-No, he didn't.

950
01:17:43,725 --> 01:17:47,422
Look at you. You're showing.

951
01:17:49,831 --> 01:17:54,200
Non-penetrative conception
is a very unusuaI thing.

952
01:17:54,903 --> 01:17:57,098
I've read about it,
but never encountered it...

953
01:17:57,305 --> 01:18:00,138
...and I've been on staff here
for eight years.

954
01:18:00,642 --> 01:18:03,042
But in her case,
the evidence is there.

955
01:18:03,245 --> 01:18:05,475
There's no reason why
the birth shouIdn't be...

956
01:18:05,681 --> 01:18:07,615
...as troubIe-free as
a normaI conception.

957
01:18:08,483 --> 01:18:11,452
It may be necessary
to physicaIIy break the hymen...

958
01:18:11,653 --> 01:18:13,814
...cIoser to the actuaI
deIivery date.

959
01:18:14,022 --> 01:18:16,991
But that shouId be
a painIess procedure.

960
01:18:18,093 --> 01:18:19,890
You understand?

961
01:18:24,700 --> 01:18:26,361
It's kind of neat what the guy did...

962
01:18:26,568 --> 01:18:30,004
...but put a hot tub over here and
Iandscaping and it'II Iook awesome.

963
01:18:36,178 --> 01:18:38,146
What do we do with this?

964
01:18:48,890 --> 01:18:51,324
This morning,
a button came off my suit.

965
01:18:51,526 --> 01:18:54,654
CouId you sew it on for me
before the funeraI?

966
01:18:58,200 --> 01:19:00,134
Are you Iistening to me?

967
01:19:04,239 --> 01:19:05,866
What's wrong with you?

968
01:19:11,113 --> 01:19:13,172
Magdalena was teIIing the truth.

969
01:19:13,381 --> 01:19:14,541
You saw Magdalena?

970
01:19:16,618 --> 01:19:19,178
Today at Tomas'.

971
01:19:19,721 --> 01:19:24,556
We went to the cIinic together.
The doctor examined her and it's true.

972
01:19:24,760 --> 01:19:26,751
She's never been with a boy.

973
01:19:26,962 --> 01:19:28,395
What?

974
01:19:29,464 --> 01:19:31,455
It's a miracIe.

975
01:19:55,857 --> 01:19:59,816
Tomas AIvarez was a good man.

976
01:20:01,129 --> 01:20:05,691
A man who embodied
the Lord's commandments.

977
01:20:05,901 --> 01:20:11,430
EspeciaIIy the commandment
to Iove thy neighbor.

978
01:20:13,241 --> 01:20:15,004
We can be sure
that in this moment...

979
01:20:15,977 --> 01:20:20,243
...Tomas has gone to a better pIace.

980
01:20:22,017 --> 01:20:23,541
Amen.

981
01:20:25,987 --> 01:20:28,285
Before concIuding our service...

982
01:20:28,657 --> 01:20:34,118
...Carlos, the nephew of Tomas,
wouId Iike to say a few words.

983
01:20:55,083 --> 01:21:01,420
Tomas AIvarez was born in JaIisco,
Mexico in 1 92 1 .

984
01:21:02,023 --> 01:21:04,958
The 1 3th kid out of 22.

985
01:21:05,660 --> 01:21:08,288
When he was born,
he was so smaII...

986
01:21:08,496 --> 01:21:11,590
...the midwife said
he wasn't worth washing.

987
01:21:12,400 --> 01:21:13,958
He ended up outIiving aII of them.

988
01:21:15,537 --> 01:21:19,496
In his Iife, he was an office boy...

989
01:21:20,742 --> 01:21:24,473
...a barber, and a farm worker.

990
01:21:25,280 --> 01:21:28,408
Then in America,
he soId champurrado.

991
01:21:28,617 --> 01:21:30,551
Everybody knew him.

992
01:21:31,253 --> 01:21:32,811
If you waIk down the street...

993
01:21:33,021 --> 01:21:35,512
...he wouId stop every
two minutes to taIk to someone.

994
01:21:37,359 --> 01:21:39,725
They were aIways happy to see him.

995
01:21:44,065 --> 01:21:47,296
He had a Iove inside him
that was so strong.

996
01:21:49,237 --> 01:21:52,604
It came from his heart and out through
his eyes Iike a goIden Iight.

997
01:21:55,410 --> 01:21:57,503
Everybody couId see it...

998
01:21:58,580 --> 01:22:02,277
...because he Ioved everyone
and judged no one.

999
01:22:05,253 --> 01:22:10,589
At the end of my Iife, I wiII count it
as my greatest priviIege...

1000
01:22:11,559 --> 01:22:13,527
...that I knew a saint.

1001
01:22:15,730 --> 01:22:18,665
Because Tomas AIvarez
was a saint.

1002
01:22:21,937 --> 01:22:27,273
And he wiII not Ieave us.
His spirit is stiII strong.

1003
01:22:29,444 --> 01:22:31,309
He'II be with us
tiII the end of our days.

1004
01:23:03,478 --> 01:23:07,812
Your mother teIIs me
this is some kind of a miracIe.

1005
01:23:09,384 --> 01:23:12,353
There's a scientific expIanation.

1006
01:23:13,488 --> 01:23:16,582
The Lord works in mysterious ways.

1007
01:23:16,925 --> 01:23:19,052
This wasn't his doing.

1008
01:23:19,260 --> 01:23:22,491
Everything is his doing.

1009
01:23:37,612 --> 01:23:39,671
WiII you forgive me?

1010
01:23:43,672 --> 01:23:44,672
of course papa

1011
01:23:49,224 --> 01:23:51,590
I'II make it up to you.

1012
01:23:54,763 --> 01:23:56,663
I promise.

1013
01:26:18,112 --> 01:26:22,000
In memory of Thomas Paterson
1908-1997
