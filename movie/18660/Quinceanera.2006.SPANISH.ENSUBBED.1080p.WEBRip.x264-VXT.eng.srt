than Eileen.

If you say so.

-I can't believe
he would do that.

have been there.

and shit.

I wanna hang out
with Van Gogh,

tell him he was gonna be
a big hit.

You know before,
what happened...

168
00:16:25,418 --> 00:16:27,254
I never meant
to disrespect you.

169

-You didn't.

170
00:16:31,091 --> 00:16:33,426
So it was okay,
what we did?

00:16:34,661 --> 00:16:36,029
It was okay.

172
00:16:37,397 --> 00:16:39,032
Cool.

173
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:51,778
So why'd you get
so mad at me?

174
00:16:51,811 --> 00:16:53,213
You were
after stupid Jessica.

175
00:16:53,246 --> 00:16:55,648
I wasn't.
That's just you being crazy.

176
00:16:55,682 --> 00:16:58,318
-She likes me.

177
00:16:58,351 --> 00:17:00,587
But I can't stand her.
I swear.

178
00:17:03,656 --> 00:17:05,092
Try and catch me.

179
00:17:06,159 --> 00:17:07,494
Herman.

180
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:12,199
Oh.

181
00:17:12,232 --> 00:17:14,834
Nice. Oh.

182
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:17,470
-Your titties are so big.
-Shut up.

183
00:17:17,504 --> 00:17:18,838
They are.

184
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:21,241
-Nearly as big as Jessica's.
-Shut up!

185
00:17:24,711 --> 00:17:26,746
-I missed you.
-Good.

186
00:17:26,779 --> 00:17:28,681
-No.

187
00:17:32,719 --> 00:17:34,487
You're so beautiful.

188
00:17:38,858 --> 00:17:41,328
-I like you so much.
-Herman.

189
00:17:41,361 --> 00:17:42,262
I do.

190
00:17:44,431 --> 00:17:46,833
-Feel that.
-No.

191
00:17:46,866 --> 00:17:48,535
Come on.

192
00:17:52,439 --> 00:17:54,073
I love you.

193
00:18:02,615 --> 00:18:04,517
This thing's not gonna work.

194
00:18:04,551 --> 00:18:05,585
That's the only one
we have.

195
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:08,888
Sorry I'm late, Tio Tomas.

196
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:10,623
They thought
you weren't coming today.

197
00:18:10,657 --> 00:18:13,693
Oh, no.
Come here, buddy.

198
00:18:13,726 --> 00:18:15,662
TOMAS: I'll get the leashes.
MAGDALENA: Okay.

199
00:18:15,695 --> 00:18:17,730
-Hello.

200
00:18:17,764 --> 00:18:20,300
Gee, thanks.

201
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:22,469
-Nothin'.

202
00:18:24,904 --> 00:18:28,308
Eileen told me some things
about you.

203
00:18:28,341 --> 00:18:30,510
-Just things.

204
00:18:32,745 --> 00:18:35,215
And don't let 'em shit
on the Hernandez lawn.

205
00:18:35,248 --> 00:18:37,217
Yeah, all right.
Come on, boys.

206
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:38,851
This time take 'em
for more than five minutes.

207
00:18:38,885 --> 00:18:40,153
Yes, Tio Tomas.

208
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:44,924
Hmm.

209
00:18:48,861 --> 00:18:50,497
MAN:
Yeah, we're landlords now.

210
00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:52,865
It's two units.

211
00:18:52,899 --> 00:18:55,435
There's ours and then
this place in the back
where this old guy lives.

212
00:18:55,468 --> 00:18:57,370
Yeah, the rate was good.
It was a 30-year.

213
00:18:57,404 --> 00:19:00,307
But it's still a shitload
of money per month.

214
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:01,874
Wow.

215
00:19:01,908 --> 00:19:05,712
There's a super hot cholo
coming up the back stairs
wearing a wife beater.

216
00:19:05,745 --> 00:19:08,881
James!
James, back door.

217
00:19:09,949 --> 00:19:11,418
Hello.

218
00:19:11,451 --> 00:19:13,853
You guys got
an adjustable wrench?

219
00:19:13,886 --> 00:19:16,656
-An adjustable wrench
for the garbage disposal.

220
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:19,692
Oh, you live
in the back with, um...

221
00:19:19,726 --> 00:19:21,228
-Tomas.
-With Tomas, right.

222
00:19:21,261 --> 00:19:22,562
Yeah, come on in.

223
00:19:24,531 --> 00:19:26,799
So, Tomas is what?
Your grandfather?

224
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:28,301
No, he's my uncle.

225
00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:31,704
That garden he planted
is really unbelievable.

226
00:19:31,738 --> 00:19:33,540
-Yeah, it's cool.

227
00:19:33,573 --> 00:19:37,377
Um, 83, four.
He's my great-great-uncle.

228
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:39,279
So I guess he's lived
back there a long time?

229
00:19:39,312 --> 00:19:41,981
Yeah, a real long time.
Since before I was born.

230
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:43,182
Well, how old are you?

231
00:19:44,984 --> 00:19:46,353
Old enough.

232
00:19:48,788 --> 00:19:51,958
-I knew it was in the truck.
-I never said it wasn't.

233
00:19:51,991 --> 00:19:53,560
All right.
Will this do?

234
00:19:54,594 --> 00:19:56,496
Yeah, it's cool.

235
00:19:56,529 --> 00:19:58,265
Thanks, guys.
I'll get it back
to you guys later.

236
00:19:58,298 --> 00:20:01,434
-No worries.
-JAMES: Oh, hey, Carlos.

237
00:20:01,468 --> 00:20:03,936
We're having
a housewarming party
a week from Saturday.

238
00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:05,738
Do you wanna come?

239
00:20:05,772 --> 00:20:07,840
-JAMES: 9:00, 9:30.

240
00:20:10,009 --> 00:20:14,381
Well, I've got some things
I'm supposed to do, but, uh...
we'll see.

241
00:20:14,414 --> 00:20:15,748
JAMES: Cool.

242
00:20:15,782 --> 00:20:17,350
See you later, dude.

243
00:20:18,951 --> 00:20:20,987
-Trust me.

244
00:20:26,626 --> 00:20:28,328
GIRL:
Why'd you do that?

245
00:20:34,834 --> 00:20:35,635
BOY 1: You all right?

246
00:21:36,028 --> 00:21:38,831
I don't understand
what the problem is.
It wasn't that much.

247
00:21:38,865 --> 00:21:42,335
$500 for the afternoon,
driver included.

248
00:21:42,369 --> 00:21:44,804
Ask one of the cousins.
I'm sure someone
will padrino it.

249
00:21:44,837 --> 00:21:46,773
I don't know, tÃ­a.
He hates the whole idea.

250
00:21:46,806 --> 00:21:49,476
Well, that's your father,
isn't it?

251
00:21:49,509 --> 00:21:52,979
A good man, a holy man,
but with his head
in the clouds.

252
00:21:53,012 --> 00:21:55,114
Some of us here on Earth,
we like a little luxury
now and then.

253
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:57,584
Mmm-hmm.

254
00:21:57,617 --> 00:21:59,619
Okay.
Put your shoulders down.

255
00:21:59,652 --> 00:22:01,521
You're a pretty girl.

256
00:22:01,554 --> 00:22:03,490
Neck, fourteen and a half.

257
00:22:03,523 --> 00:22:04,957
Chest,
thirty-three and a half.

258
00:22:04,991 --> 00:22:06,559
Waist, thirty-one.

259
00:22:06,593 --> 00:22:08,428
-Hips, thirty-six and a half.

260
00:22:08,461 --> 00:22:09,662
-That's so big.
-I know.

261
00:22:09,696 --> 00:22:12,932
I thought you'd be smaller
than Eileen.

262
00:22:12,965 --> 00:22:14,834
Congratulations,
you're still in the running

263
00:22:14,867 --> 00:22:15,968
towards becoming
America's Next Top Model.

264
00:22:16,002 --> 00:22:17,069
Thank you.

265
00:22:17,103 --> 00:22:19,906
TYRA: The next name
I'm going to call...

266
00:22:19,939 --> 00:22:21,608
Christina.

267
00:22:21,641 --> 00:22:23,410
MARIA: Jasiel,
how many tamales
do you want?

268
00:22:23,443 --> 00:22:24,711
Three.

269
00:22:24,744 --> 00:22:26,379
And you, Magdalena?

270
00:22:26,413 --> 00:22:28,648
It's okay, Mom.
I'm not hungry.

271
00:22:28,681 --> 00:22:31,451
TYRA: You learned
a new trick today.
Congratulations.

272
00:22:32,852 --> 00:22:34,954
Here, Joey, here, Arthur.

273
00:22:34,987 --> 00:22:36,456
Here. Come here.

274
00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:45,998
You wanna take a jacket?
It's cold outside.

275
00:22:46,032 --> 00:22:47,534
Nah.

276
00:22:47,567 --> 00:22:49,736
-I'm not going far.
-Okay.

277
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:53,039
Here, Joey.
Here you go.

278
00:23:11,758 --> 00:23:14,160
So echinacea...
Hey.

279
00:23:14,193 --> 00:23:16,028
MAN 1: I told you before
to adjust...

280
00:23:16,062 --> 00:23:17,764
MAN 2:
I know. I know.

281
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:31,511
MAN 3: I had friends
who had a house.

282
00:23:31,544 --> 00:23:32,745
MAN 4: How long have you
been in LA?

283
00:23:32,779 --> 00:23:34,413
MAN 5: About two weeks.

284
00:23:36,182 --> 00:23:37,717
-Chillin'.

285
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:39,018
-Glad you could make it.
-Thanks.

286
00:23:39,051 --> 00:23:40,753
-You want a drink
or something?
-Yeah.

287
00:23:40,787 --> 00:23:42,121
Come on.

288
00:23:42,154 --> 00:23:43,723
MAN 6: Nice. It's crazy here.

289
00:23:43,756 --> 00:23:45,224
Did you come with anyone?

290
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:46,993
MAN 7: No. Single tonight.

291
00:23:47,026 --> 00:23:47,760
MAN 6: Nice.

292
00:23:50,663 --> 00:23:52,098
Tony, this is Carlos.
Carlos, Tony.

293
00:23:52,131 --> 00:23:53,666
-Hey.

294
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:55,468
-Uh, beer's fine.

295
00:23:59,506 --> 00:24:00,940
Cheers.

296
00:24:00,973 --> 00:24:03,209
STEPHEN: Wow, James.
Congratulations on
the new place.

297
00:24:03,242 --> 00:24:05,244
Oh, thanks.
Come here, I want you
to meet some friends.

298
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:06,913
Carlos,
this is Stephen and Simon.

299
00:24:06,946 --> 00:24:08,715
-Hey, Carlos.

300
00:24:08,748 --> 00:24:10,617
We've been looking
around Echo Park for awhile

301
00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:11,884
and every time
something comes up

302
00:24:11,918 --> 00:24:13,653
we get half a dozen people
bidding over asking.

303
00:24:13,686 --> 00:24:14,954
I know. This area's
so hot right now.

304
00:24:14,987 --> 00:24:16,623
SIMON: It's so hot.

305
00:24:16,656 --> 00:24:18,725
We were looking at a place
a couple years ago, right?

306
00:24:18,758 --> 00:24:20,693
And... But Stephen
was a little too concerned
about the crime.

307
00:24:20,727 --> 00:24:21,761
STEPHEN: No, I wasn't.

308
00:24:21,794 --> 00:24:24,096
SIMON: Yes, he was.

309
00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:26,499
Anyway, that place
went back on the market
and doubled in two years.

310
00:24:26,533 --> 00:24:28,968
Let's hope it keeps up.
You have no idea how much
we paid for this place.

311
00:24:44,984 --> 00:24:46,719
They'll run to you,
or they run away from you.

312
00:24:57,096 --> 00:24:58,898
I'm wasted.

313
00:25:03,703 --> 00:25:05,271
I want you
to meet somebody.

314
00:25:05,304 --> 00:25:08,007
Hey, Carlos,
this is Alejandro.
Alejandro, Carlos.

315
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:09,542
-Carlos lives
in the back house.

316
00:25:09,576 --> 00:25:10,643
GARY: James,
where are the limes?

317
00:25:10,677 --> 00:25:12,645
I'll be right back.

318
00:25:35,101 --> 00:25:36,268
Shots!

319
00:25:36,302 --> 00:25:38,304
-Hook it up.
-Yes.

320
00:25:38,337 --> 00:25:39,538
Please.

321
00:25:45,111 --> 00:25:46,646
Whoo!

322
00:26:05,297 --> 00:26:07,934
-Oh, it's a good one.
-Let's have a look.

323
00:26:07,967 --> 00:26:09,101
Cool. See?

324
00:26:11,337 --> 00:26:12,705
Cool.

325
00:26:15,007 --> 00:26:17,343
Look,
you can zoom in.

326
00:26:17,376 --> 00:26:18,678
I'm so fucked up.

327
00:26:22,314 --> 00:26:24,717
-Yeah.

328
00:26:29,055 --> 00:26:31,323
-Travieso.

329
00:26:32,391 --> 00:26:33,693
What's that mean?

330
00:26:35,695 --> 00:26:37,596
-It means "troublemaker."

331
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:49,776
Feel good?

332
00:26:50,209 --> 00:26:51,644
Sure.

333
00:27:18,971 --> 00:27:20,139
I know it looks like
one of those openings

334
00:27:20,172 --> 00:27:22,141
for one of those,
like, bad novellas.

335
00:27:22,174 --> 00:27:23,309
I know.

336
00:27:26,779 --> 00:27:28,681
Wow. You got bells
and everything.

337
00:27:28,715 --> 00:27:30,182
I know.

338
00:27:33,085 --> 00:27:34,453
May

339
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:36,255
I'm your cousin,
I didn't even know that.

340
00:27:36,288 --> 00:27:38,825
EILEEN: You didn't know that?
MAGDALENA: No.

341
00:27:38,858 --> 00:27:40,292
JASMINE:
Wow, that looks good.

342
00:27:40,326 --> 00:27:42,294
MAGDALENA: Is that a cake
or a pillow or what is it?

343
00:27:42,328 --> 00:27:43,763
-Cardboard.

344
00:27:46,465 --> 00:27:49,435
JASMINE:
Aw, you look cute.

345
00:27:49,468 --> 00:27:51,470
MAGDALENA:
You didn't wear a tiara
in your Quinceanera.

346
00:27:51,503 --> 00:27:53,906
I know. I broke it in the car
on the way to church.

347
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:57,009
-Yeah.

348
00:27:57,043 --> 00:28:00,012
JASMINE: Your hair's cute.
EILEEN: Thanks.

349
00:28:00,046 --> 00:28:01,948
WENDY: Those flowers
are nice.

350
00:28:03,215 --> 00:28:05,051
Nice.

351
00:28:05,084 --> 00:28:08,020
WENDY: It looks like
you're looking for bugs.

352
00:28:08,054 --> 00:28:09,455
Ew. It looks like there
is a bug. You see it?

353
00:28:09,488 --> 00:28:10,790
Oh, yeah.
That's right.

354
00:28:12,091 --> 00:28:14,193
JASMINE:
Okay, it's not just me.

355
00:28:16,495 --> 00:28:20,066
WENDY: Oh, that's so pretty.
MAGDALENA: Ah, the dress.

356
00:28:20,099 --> 00:28:21,768
MAGDALENA: Oh, wow!
ALL: Oh!

357
00:28:25,471 --> 00:28:28,374
That was cute.

358
00:28:28,407 --> 00:28:31,177
It would help if you actually
applied it on your face.

359
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:32,845
JASMINE: Right.

360
00:28:32,879 --> 00:28:34,480
WENDY: She's putting it
on the air.

361
00:28:34,513 --> 00:28:36,148
JASMINE: She has
her whole face on.

362
00:28:36,182 --> 00:28:37,850
WENDY:
Her facial expression...

363
00:28:37,884 --> 00:28:38,885
JASMINE: You do not
need more lip gloss.

364
00:28:38,918 --> 00:28:40,152
EILEEN: Oh, I know.

365
00:28:40,186 --> 00:28:42,254
JASMINE: Lips all shiny.

366
00:28:42,288 --> 00:28:43,856
Aw, so pretty.

367
00:28:45,191 --> 00:28:47,226
MAGDALENA:
Oh, tÃ­a Silvia looks pissed.

368
00:28:47,259 --> 00:28:49,161
I can't tell
if she's gonna, like, cry,

369
00:28:49,195 --> 00:28:50,296
or smack the crap
outta ya.

370
00:28:56,002 --> 00:28:56,936
Oh, wow.

371
00:28:58,237 --> 00:28:59,972
JASMINE: Your dress is
really pretty, though.

372
00:29:00,006 --> 00:29:03,175
EILEEN: Thanks.
My mom's supposed to
alter it for Magdalena.

373
00:29:03,209 --> 00:29:05,344
Aren't you the same size?

374
00:29:05,377 --> 00:29:08,047
EILEEN: Almost. She just has
to take it out a little bit.

375
00:29:10,282 --> 00:29:11,818
JASMINE: Aw!

376
00:29:16,923 --> 00:29:18,825
I heard in my history class

377
00:29:18,858 --> 00:29:20,492
they're signing up people
to take a trip to Germany
next spring.

378
00:29:20,526 --> 00:29:24,096
-Yeah, if I win the lottery.

379
00:29:24,130 --> 00:29:25,865
What do you
wanna go there for?

380
00:29:25,898 --> 00:29:28,835
I wanna see the world.
I wanna travel.

381
00:29:28,868 --> 00:29:31,838
I mean,
I'm sick of Echo Park.

382
00:29:31,871 --> 00:29:33,806
I know every building,
I know every piece of grass.

383
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,374
I'm sick of it too.

384
00:29:36,508 --> 00:29:39,011
What's wrong?

385
00:29:39,045 --> 00:29:42,181
-Nothing.

386
00:29:42,214 --> 00:29:44,516
If I tell you,
you'll just think I'm stupid
and superficial.

387
00:29:44,550 --> 00:29:46,819
-I won't.
-Yes, you will.

388
00:29:46,853 --> 00:29:48,888
Come on. Tell me.

389
00:29:48,921 --> 00:29:51,123
It's my dad.
He's being a real jerk.

390
00:29:51,157 --> 00:29:53,926
-Yeah.

391
00:29:55,361 --> 00:29:56,595
I knew
I shouldn't have told you.

392
00:29:56,628 --> 00:29:57,930
It's okay.

393
00:29:57,964 --> 00:30:00,266
I mean, I know
it means a lot to you.

394
00:30:00,299 --> 00:30:02,568
Don't try to make like
you understand me, okay?
'Cause you don't.

395
00:30:02,601 --> 00:30:04,336
You don't have to
go through this crap
'cause you're a guy.

396
00:30:04,370 --> 00:30:05,972
Okay. I'm sorry.

397
00:30:07,573 --> 00:30:09,808
I'm sorry.
I don't mean
to be a bitch.

398
00:30:10,409 --> 00:30:11,944
It's okay.

399
00:30:15,314 --> 00:30:16,382
Here you go.

400
00:30:16,415 --> 00:30:18,885
Twenty minutes in the oven
on 400.

401
00:30:20,419 --> 00:30:22,021
Okay. Thanks, Mom.

402
00:30:22,054 --> 00:30:23,856
And I'll be back from work
about midnight.

403
00:30:23,890 --> 00:30:24,957
Mmm.

404
00:30:26,358 --> 00:30:28,160
Before you go,
can I ask you something?

405
00:30:28,194 --> 00:30:30,229
Mmm-hmm.

406
00:30:30,262 --> 00:30:32,531
There's this girl,
a friend of mine,
her Quinceanera's coming up

407
00:30:32,564 --> 00:30:36,202
and I thought that maybe
Uncle Hector could get us
a deal on a Hummer limo.

408
00:30:36,235 --> 00:30:38,370
-Just a friend.

409
00:30:38,404 --> 00:30:39,538
Oh, really?

410
00:30:39,571 --> 00:30:41,908
It's not like that, Mom.
She's the preacher's daughter.

411
00:30:41,941 --> 00:30:45,144
I don't care
whose daughter she is, mijo.

412
00:30:45,177 --> 00:30:47,113
You have school
to think about, okay?

413
00:30:47,146 --> 00:30:49,181
-Okay.
-Mmm.

414
00:30:49,215 --> 00:30:51,583
And besides, Uncle Hector,
he just works for the company.

415
00:30:51,617 --> 00:30:53,052
He can't set the price.

416
00:31:13,539 --> 00:31:15,441
Did you see your friends
again tonight?

417
00:31:15,474 --> 00:31:16,976
Yeah.

418
00:31:17,009 --> 00:31:20,279
-That's nice.
-Yeah.

419
00:31:24,050 --> 00:31:26,018
-Hey, Tio.
-Yeah.

420
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:30,389
You ever think
about getting married?

421
00:31:30,422 --> 00:31:32,358
Yeah.

422
00:31:32,391 --> 00:31:34,260
I've had a...
a couple of close calls.

423
00:31:35,995 --> 00:31:37,396
Where?
Was it here or back in...

424
00:31:37,429 --> 00:31:41,200
No, back in Mexico.
There was one.

425
00:31:41,233 --> 00:31:44,503
Maria Epifania.

426
00:31:44,536 --> 00:31:47,673
We worked in the same office.
Different floors.

427
00:31:47,706 --> 00:31:49,675
I thought about her a lot.

428
00:31:49,708 --> 00:31:51,577
All the time.

429
00:31:53,545 --> 00:31:55,014
She liked you?

430
00:31:55,047 --> 00:31:56,682
Yeah, I think she did.

431
00:31:56,715 --> 00:31:59,585
-Oh, yeah.

432
00:31:59,618 --> 00:32:04,056
She was a very sweet,
a very beautiful girl.

433
00:32:05,257 --> 00:32:07,059
What happened?

434
00:32:07,093 --> 00:32:08,694
Well, we saw each other
a few times.

435
00:32:08,727 --> 00:32:11,430
But I couldn't afford
very much.

436
00:32:11,463 --> 00:32:14,433
Then my mother become ill.
Very ill.

437
00:32:16,235 --> 00:32:17,669
And I had to move back
to the ranch

438
00:32:17,703 --> 00:32:21,240
near Tepatitlan, Jalisco,
and take care of her.

439
00:32:22,608 --> 00:32:24,143
So I just couldn't.

440
00:32:25,277 --> 00:32:26,212
Hmm.

441
00:32:29,148 --> 00:32:31,550
-Yeah, that's messed up.
-Yeah.

442
00:33:11,257 --> 00:33:14,293
(MAGDALENA SINGING
IN DISTANCE)

443
00:33:14,326 --> 00:33:18,030
GIRL: I'm telling you,
these are just the most
rocking tamales in Echo Park.

444
00:33:18,064 --> 00:33:21,133
We'll see about that.

445
00:33:21,167 --> 00:33:23,802
Can I put it in the back?
I don't want it to get dirty.

446
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:25,171
Okay.

447
00:33:29,775 --> 00:33:31,410
MARIA:
Silvia, you added
a lot of extra flowers.

448
00:33:31,443 --> 00:33:33,679
No, I didn't.
I moved a few around.

449
00:33:33,712 --> 00:33:35,081
It looks beautiful.

450
00:33:41,587 --> 00:33:45,091
Go try it on.
We're all waiting.
Go, go, go, go, go, go.

451
00:33:51,797 --> 00:33:53,432
Okay, breathe in.

452
00:33:55,367 --> 00:33:56,568
Breathe in.

453
00:34:09,848 --> 00:34:11,183
Turn around.

454
00:34:13,452 --> 00:34:15,154
You must have gotten
the measurements wrong.

455
00:34:15,187 --> 00:34:17,523
I did not.

456
00:34:17,556 --> 00:34:20,092
We'll let out the seam,
and it will be fine.

457
00:34:24,863 --> 00:34:26,632
Has she been eating
a lot lately?

458
00:34:26,665 --> 00:34:28,267
No.

459
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:30,269
Ay, Maria,
I hope that I'm wrong.

460
00:34:30,302 --> 00:34:32,304
What?

461
00:34:32,338 --> 00:34:36,375
No one could've
brought up a girl better
than you brought up Magdalena.

462
00:34:36,408 --> 00:34:38,177
-No one.
-MAGDALENA: Mom!

463
00:35:00,432 --> 00:35:02,434
You'll need an extra blanket.

464
00:35:09,241 --> 00:35:10,876
It's getting cold tonight.

465
00:35:17,349 --> 00:35:18,250
What?

466
00:35:19,685 --> 00:35:21,687
Mija. Mija.

467
00:35:22,888 --> 00:35:24,756
Have you been with Herman?

468
00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:27,226
No, Mom, I haven't been
with Herman.

469
00:35:27,259 --> 00:35:28,894
I mean,
having relations with...

470
00:35:28,927 --> 00:35:30,396
No.

471
00:35:30,429 --> 00:35:32,398
-Or any other boy...
-Mom!

472
00:35:32,431 --> 00:35:33,899
I know. I'm sorry.

473
00:36:52,511 --> 00:36:53,745
Papa.

474
00:36:58,016 --> 00:36:59,585
It's not what you think.

475
00:37:07,559 --> 00:37:08,494
The test is wrong.

476
00:37:09,761 --> 00:37:10,762
It is!

477
00:37:13,932 --> 00:37:15,367
I'm telling you, Papa,
I haven't been with a boy!

478
00:37:23,008 --> 00:37:24,576
Why aren't you
listening to me?

479
00:37:24,610 --> 00:37:26,345
Go to your room.
Let me handle this.

480
00:38:38,116 --> 00:38:39,585
Hey.

481
00:38:39,618 --> 00:38:41,119
-Nothing.

482
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:45,056
I'm just digging the yard.
In between jobs.

483
00:38:45,090 --> 00:38:49,060
-Yeah, I work in TV, so...
it's feast or famine.

484
00:38:49,728 --> 00:38:52,364
Cool.

485
00:38:52,398 --> 00:38:54,766
-Nothing. Just got off work.

486
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:55,934
Oh, yeah?
Where do you work?

487
00:38:55,967 --> 00:38:56,935
Over at the car wash.

488
00:39:00,972 --> 00:39:02,708
So you from London?

489
00:39:02,741 --> 00:39:05,010
Yes.

490
00:39:05,043 --> 00:39:07,379
-No, it's like this.

491
00:39:08,046 --> 00:39:09,848
And this one's an E.

492
00:39:10,849 --> 00:39:12,384
This one's a P.

493
00:39:14,786 --> 00:39:17,389
-Echo Parque.
-Echo Parque.

494
00:39:19,691 --> 00:39:21,827
Be careful
you don't flash that
around Temple Street, though.

495
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:23,829
They're the rival gang,
right?

496
00:39:23,862 --> 00:39:25,096
They'd kill you.

497
00:39:25,130 --> 00:39:27,098
Wow.

498
00:39:27,132 --> 00:39:28,500
You really live in
a whole other world,
don't you?

499
00:39:29,034 --> 00:39:31,036
Nah. You do.

500
00:39:39,911 --> 00:39:41,112
You know,
we should wait for James.

501
00:40:28,694 --> 00:40:30,829
Hey, boys. Come here.

502
00:40:31,697 --> 00:40:33,031
Come here, boy.

503
00:40:33,665 --> 00:40:34,933
Hey.

504
00:40:42,541 --> 00:40:44,242
Hey.

505
00:40:44,275 --> 00:40:46,978
Carlos. I can make some tea.
Would you like some?

506
00:40:47,012 --> 00:40:49,648
Nah, I'm straight.
What's up with you?

507
00:40:49,681 --> 00:40:51,049
Nothing.

508
00:40:51,082 --> 00:40:52,217
Leave her alone.

509
00:40:57,623 --> 00:40:59,558
Oh, my God,
did you see the boys
playing basketball today?

510
00:40:59,591 --> 00:41:01,760
-WENDY: Yes, I did.
-Oh, my gosh.

511
00:41:01,793 --> 00:41:03,695
Manuel had his head shaved.
Did you see?

512
00:41:03,729 --> 00:41:05,631
-Horrible.

513
00:41:05,664 --> 00:41:07,633
-It looks like
he has leukemia.

514
00:41:07,666 --> 00:41:09,568
I think short hair is sexy.

515
00:41:09,601 --> 00:41:12,037
But his head is so weird.
He looks like E.T.

So you moved in
with your uncle?

527
00:41:38,564 --> 00:41:40,766
Why'd you do that?

528
00:41:40,799 --> 00:41:43,569
It's closer to school.
It means I can walk.

529
00:41:43,602 --> 00:41:45,303
It's not closer.

And he's so dependent.

623
00:48:57,568 --> 00:49:00,105
Must be the age difference
or something.

than me.

older or something?

-Mmm-hmm.

658
00:50:56,254 --> 00:51:00,158
And Alberto and Paco.
And...

659
00:51:01,826 --> 00:51:04,729
I forgot his name.
Oh, God, what's his name?

660
00:51:04,762 --> 00:51:06,597

661
00:51:08,199 --> 00:51:09,534

Why is your leg
in a cast?

664
00:51:13,671 --> 00:51:16,807
CARLOS: He was in a cast
for two years.

665
00:51:16,841 --> 00:51:19,510
He laid down
behind the wheels of a truck
and tried to off himself.

TOMAS: Yeah.

669
00:51:25,483 --> 00:51:28,419
Well, when I was
nine years old,

670
00:51:28,453 --> 00:51:32,423
I decided I didn't want
any more of this life.

671
00:51:32,457 --> 00:51:35,360
I wanted to come back
as someone else.

672
00:51:35,393 --> 00:51:39,597
So I hide behind
the back wheels of a truck

673
00:51:39,630 --> 00:51:41,132
and waited for it to start.

674
00:51:41,166 --> 00:51:43,501
-It did.

675
00:51:43,534 --> 00:51:45,636
I wasn't supposed to live.

676
00:51:45,670 --> 00:51:49,907
I spent months and months
in the hospital.

677
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:55,213
And it was a long time
before I could see
or eat or walk.

678
00:51:56,547 --> 00:52:00,218
In a way,
I got what I wanted.

679
00:52:00,251 --> 00:52:03,154
I come back
as a different person
after all that.

680
00:52:04,522 --> 00:52:06,857
Don't you ever
try it, though.

681
00:52:23,741 --> 00:52:24,675

with those guys anyway?

No.

687

Yeah, right.

691
00:52:45,596 --> 00:52:47,565
Come on, Carlos.
I told you stuff.

692
00:52:48,666 --> 00:52:50,701
We mess around, all right?

693
00:52:50,735 --> 00:52:52,803
Are you the peanut butter
in the sandwich?

694
00:52:52,837 --> 00:52:54,372
Fuck you.

695
00:52:54,405 --> 00:52:55,840
Do you like
both of them the same?

696
00:52:55,873 --> 00:52:57,208
No.

697
00:52:57,242 --> 00:52:58,643
The young one's
better looking.

698
00:52:58,676 --> 00:53:00,845
-Yeah. Gary.
-Mmm.

699
00:53:00,878 --> 00:53:02,780
-Nothing.

700
00:53:05,616 --> 00:53:06,917
Have you done
that kind of thing a lot?

701
00:53:06,951 --> 00:53:08,719
Mmm. First time.

702
00:53:08,753 --> 00:53:11,556
-Nah, first time ever.

703
00:53:11,989 --> 00:53:13,891
Yeah?

704
00:53:13,924 --> 00:53:15,793
I thought Uncle Walter
caught you with some boy?

705
00:53:15,826 --> 00:53:18,463
What? Is that what
Eileen told ya?

706
00:53:18,496 --> 00:53:20,531
Mmm-hmm.

707
00:53:20,565 --> 00:53:22,700
He tracked this site
I used to go to
on the Internet.

708
00:53:22,733 --> 00:53:24,669
-Yeah.

709
00:53:24,702 --> 00:53:26,237
Fucked up, huh?

710
00:53:54,932 --> 00:53:56,334
You're getting big.

711
00:53:56,367 --> 00:53:58,436
You mean fat.

712
00:53:58,469 --> 00:53:59,970
Come on.
Don't be like that.

713
00:54:00,004 --> 00:54:00,971
You don't like it,
do you?

714
00:54:01,005 --> 00:54:02,673
Of course I do.

715
00:54:02,707 --> 00:54:04,375
So, what are you up to
this weekend?

716
00:54:04,409 --> 00:54:05,776
Not much.
What about you?

717
00:54:05,810 --> 00:54:07,312
It's kind of crazy.

718
00:54:07,345 --> 00:54:08,746
Saturday,
I got my AP History exam.

719
00:54:08,779 --> 00:54:10,047
And Saturday night's
my mom's birthday.

720
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:12,350
I'm taking her
out to dinner.

721
00:54:12,383 --> 00:54:15,052
-No.

722
00:54:15,085 --> 00:54:16,887
I keep waiting
for the right time.

723
00:54:16,921 --> 00:54:18,289
Mmm-hmm.

724
00:54:18,323 --> 00:54:21,292
I wanna tell her
after her birthday.

725
00:54:21,326 --> 00:54:22,760
Well, I gotta get going.
Come on, boy.

726
00:54:29,900 --> 00:54:32,670
Hey.

727
00:54:32,703 --> 00:54:35,340
We're kind of having
a barbecue over at my house
on Sunday.

728
00:54:35,373 --> 00:54:37,808
Just some friends,
relatives and stuff.

729
00:54:37,842 --> 00:54:40,044
You wanna come?

730
00:54:40,077 --> 00:54:43,914
-Yeah. If you want me to.
-Yeah. It'll be great.

731
00:54:43,948 --> 00:54:45,750
Cool. Call me then.

732
00:54:45,783 --> 00:54:46,817
Mmm-hmm.

733
00:55:25,656 --> 00:55:26,724
Hey.

734
00:55:27,825 --> 00:55:30,561
Hey. What's up?

735
00:55:30,595 --> 00:55:33,598
Not much.
What's up with you?

736
00:55:33,631 --> 00:55:36,000
-The food looks good.
-Yeah.

737
00:55:36,033 --> 00:55:39,604
-No, not yet.
I'm all right, thanks.

738
00:55:39,637 --> 00:55:40,938
We forgot
the hamburger buns.

739
00:55:40,971 --> 00:55:42,640
I thought we had some.

740
00:55:42,673 --> 00:55:44,909
Just two packs
and people are gonna
start arriving soon.

741
00:55:44,942 --> 00:55:47,578
-I'll go get some.
-Okay then.

742
00:55:47,612 --> 00:55:49,980
Mom,
this is Magdalena.

743
00:55:50,014 --> 00:55:51,716
Hi, it's nice
to finally meet you.

744
00:55:51,749 --> 00:55:52,850
Nice to meet you.
Thank you for coming.

745
00:55:52,883 --> 00:55:53,984
No problem.

746
00:55:54,018 --> 00:55:55,620
Well, excuse me.

747
00:55:59,524 --> 00:56:02,760
-Yeah.

748
00:56:02,793 --> 00:56:05,029
-Well, sort of.

749
00:56:06,497 --> 00:56:09,500
What's that supposed to mean?

750
00:56:09,534 --> 00:56:11,736
She knows about you.
That you're pregnant.

751
00:56:12,537 --> 00:56:14,138
And?

752
00:56:14,171 --> 00:56:16,907
-That it's yours.

753
00:56:16,941 --> 00:56:21,045
-Well, that's stage two.
Herman.

754
00:56:21,078 --> 00:56:23,848
You don't understand.
You don't know her like I do.

755
00:56:23,881 --> 00:56:26,784
She has all these dreams
and expectations of me.

756
00:56:28,819 --> 00:56:30,054
You know,
I think I'm gonna go home.

757
00:56:30,087 --> 00:56:31,956
No, wait.

758
00:56:31,989 --> 00:56:33,123
Go to the store with me.

759
00:56:54,779 --> 00:56:56,714
-The house's really great.
The lights are cool.
-Thanks.

760
00:56:56,747 --> 00:56:58,082
We have a lot of work
to do yet.

761
00:56:58,115 --> 00:57:00,150
-Well...

762
00:57:00,184 --> 00:57:01,986
-You did a great job.
-Yeah, it's great.

763
00:57:04,755 --> 00:57:06,557
Gary, this soup's amazing.
Did you make this?

764
00:57:06,591 --> 00:57:08,225
-Mmm-hmm.

765
00:57:08,258 --> 00:57:10,027
It's just cauliflower
and caraway seeds.

766
00:57:10,060 --> 00:57:11,796
Unbelievable.

767
00:57:11,829 --> 00:57:13,230
-I have the recipe
if you want it.
-Absolutely.

768
00:57:13,263 --> 00:57:15,800
There was this really cute
Latin boy at my gym today.

769
00:57:15,833 --> 00:57:19,003
I mean, oh, my God.
Totally little cholo.

770
00:57:19,036 --> 00:57:21,171
Shaved head, tattoos,
his butt was like...

771
00:57:21,205 --> 00:57:23,007
Oh, my God,
you should meet Carlos.

772
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:24,575
-Gary.

773
00:57:24,609 --> 00:57:27,545
Gary, tell Stephen
about Carlos.

774
00:57:27,578 --> 00:57:29,980
Carlos?
He's really hot.

775
00:57:30,014 --> 00:57:31,816
Yeah, and he's
8 inches uncut.

776
00:57:34,585 --> 00:57:35,853
SIMON: Please bring him over
next time.

777
00:57:35,886 --> 00:57:38,589
JAMES: No, he's all ours.
Finders keepers.

778
00:57:40,290 --> 00:57:41,626
Babe, will you
grab the trivet?

779
00:57:41,659 --> 00:57:43,460
-This is hot.
-All right.

780
00:57:45,830 --> 00:57:47,665
Would you like me to make
the salad dressing?

781
00:57:47,698 --> 00:57:49,867
No, I'll do it.
Trash is overflowing.

782
00:58:04,148 --> 00:58:06,283
Psst. Gary.

783
00:58:06,316 --> 00:58:08,753
You scared me.

784
00:58:08,786 --> 00:58:10,555
-Nothing.

785
00:58:12,957 --> 00:58:15,092
For me? Thanks.

786
00:58:16,794 --> 00:58:19,530
"Lil Rob." Cool, man.

787
00:58:19,564 --> 00:58:21,666
Yeah, I was peeping
your CDs, man.
Your shit blows.

788
00:58:26,136 --> 00:58:27,204
You know,
I should get back.

789
00:58:27,237 --> 00:58:28,673
His rhymes are sick.

790
00:58:28,706 --> 00:58:29,540
I know.
I love Lil Rob.

791
00:58:32,677 --> 00:58:34,579
Hmm,
it says Elton John.

792
00:58:37,982 --> 00:58:40,117
Shit.
I'll take it back.

793
00:58:40,150 --> 00:58:41,686
Carlos, wait.

794
00:58:50,728 --> 00:58:53,864
OPERATOR: The cellular number
you are trying to reach
is no longer in service.

795
00:59:02,039 --> 00:59:04,141
OPERATOR: The cellular number
you are trying to reach...

796
00:59:15,085 --> 00:59:16,353
No, he's not here.

797
00:59:16,386 --> 00:59:18,856
-He's out of town
with relatives.

798
00:59:18,889 --> 00:59:20,190
I need to talk to him.

799
00:59:20,224 --> 00:59:23,828
Listen, Herman is
a straight-A student.

800
00:59:23,861 --> 00:59:26,897
He's going to finish school
and go to college
to study medicine.

801
00:59:26,931 --> 00:59:28,999
He doesn't have time
for this.

802
00:59:29,033 --> 00:59:30,935
I'm sorry about
the state you're in,

803
00:59:30,968 --> 00:59:33,604
but he gave me his word
he didn't do anything
with you.

804
00:59:33,638 --> 00:59:34,939
So I suggest
you take the problem

805
00:59:34,972 --> 00:59:36,240
to the person
who is responsible.

806
00:59:36,273 --> 00:59:37,908
Herman is responsible.

807
00:59:37,942 --> 00:59:39,677
I have my son's word,
and I believe him.

808
00:59:39,710 --> 00:59:40,745
He's lying to you.

809
00:59:40,778 --> 00:59:43,814
Please leave my son alone.
Please.

810
01:00:37,334 --> 01:00:39,336
Hey, it's James.

811
01:00:39,369 --> 01:00:42,306
No, Gary forgot his phone.

812
01:00:42,339 --> 01:00:45,442
Oh, it sounds fun.
I'd love to,
but I have a meeting.

813
01:00:45,475 --> 01:00:47,244
Yeah.
I'll tell Gary you called.

814
01:00:47,277 --> 01:00:48,813
Okay. Bye.

815
01:01:00,725 --> 01:01:01,926
Goddamn him.

816
01:01:12,803 --> 01:01:14,171
All done.

817
01:01:14,204 --> 01:01:15,873
Yeah? Thanks, Tio.

818
01:01:19,944 --> 01:01:21,478
Are you gonna see
your friend tonight?

819
01:01:21,511 --> 01:01:23,247
Yeah.

820
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:25,349
I'm glad you have
a special friend.

821
01:01:32,456 --> 01:01:34,258
JAMES:
I get up at 7:00
in the morning

822
01:01:34,291 --> 01:01:35,793
to drive
a fucking hour to work
to pay the mortgage

823
01:01:35,826 --> 01:01:37,494
on this $3200 fucking house.

824
01:01:37,527 --> 01:01:39,263
Meanwhile, you've had 12 hours
to, like, fuck the neighbor.

825
01:01:39,296 --> 01:01:41,498
GARY: You know what?

826
01:01:41,531 --> 01:01:43,100
I'm very tired
of hearing you talk
about the fucking mortgage.

827
01:01:43,133 --> 01:01:44,334
We had rules
about this shit.

828
01:01:44,368 --> 01:01:46,804
This is not the same
as before, all right?

829
01:01:46,837 --> 01:01:49,273
It is exactly the same!
Our rules were,

830
01:01:49,306 --> 01:01:51,375
if we have three-ways,
we're both there.

831
01:01:51,408 --> 01:01:54,444
Otherwise,
if I'm at work in my office,
that's cheating.

832
01:01:54,478 --> 01:01:56,480
GARY: Let's not do this,
all right?

833
01:01:56,513 --> 01:01:58,883
JAMES: Do what? You're the one
who's, like, cheating
all the fucking time.

834
01:01:58,916 --> 01:02:00,517
No, I'm not cheating
all the time.

835
01:02:00,550 --> 01:02:02,152
Why do you keep
accusing me of that?

836
01:02:02,186 --> 01:02:03,821
What... What, are you,
like, in love with him?

837
01:02:03,854 --> 01:02:07,357
No. No, I'm not in love
with him. All right?

838
01:02:07,391 --> 01:02:09,126
He's just some kid.

839
01:02:09,159 --> 01:02:10,761
I'm in love with you.

840
01:03:01,846 --> 01:03:04,248
I knew weeks ago.
Didn't you notice
how big she was getting

841
01:03:04,281 --> 01:03:05,582
when she wouldn't get changed
for basketball?

842
01:03:05,615 --> 01:03:08,318
-No.
-I heard that Herman
moved to San Diego.

843
01:03:08,352 --> 01:03:10,287
JESSICA: Imagine
having to leave town
because of her.

844
01:03:10,320 --> 01:03:12,356
You know this could've
happened to any of us.

845
01:03:12,389 --> 01:03:14,925
I know how close I've come
with Paco sometimes.

846
01:03:14,959 --> 01:03:17,594
Yeah, but at least some of us
are smart enough
to take precautions.

847
01:03:17,627 --> 01:03:20,330
Birth control.
-Well, how far have you
gone with Manuel, Jessica?

848
01:03:20,364 --> 01:03:23,500
At least I'm not going around
claiming to be a virgin
when I'm carrying a baby.

849
01:03:23,533 --> 01:03:25,369
-Yes.

850
01:03:25,402 --> 01:03:27,037
Hail Mary
and full of grace.

851
01:03:29,339 --> 01:03:31,141
-Hey.
-Hey, Magdalena.

852
01:03:31,175 --> 01:03:32,342
Hey. Hi.

853
01:03:37,381 --> 01:03:38,815
I mean...
You don't wanna do that.

854
01:03:39,416 --> 01:03:41,118
Not unless you have to.

855
01:03:41,151 --> 01:03:43,553
-What age did you
leave school?
-When I was 12.

856
01:03:43,587 --> 01:03:45,089
Well...

857
01:03:45,122 --> 01:03:47,291
That was the way it was.

858
01:03:47,324 --> 01:03:49,326
We have to work for a living.

859
01:03:49,359 --> 01:03:51,361
I hate it right now, though.
I hate school.

860
01:03:51,395 --> 01:03:53,463
I hate Herman.
I hate this baby.

861
01:03:53,497 --> 01:03:55,866
CARLOS:
Yo, Tio!

862
01:03:55,900 --> 01:03:58,568
Mija, don't leave school.
You will end up
as menso as me.

863
01:03:58,602 --> 01:04:01,571
You got a letter.

864
01:04:01,605 --> 01:04:03,340
-Did you remember
the toilet paper?
-No.

865
01:04:03,373 --> 01:04:04,641
MAGDALENA:
I knew you wouldn't.

866
01:04:04,674 --> 01:04:06,210
Then why'd you ask?

867
01:04:07,311 --> 01:04:08,412
Is it in English, Tio?

868
01:04:12,082 --> 01:04:15,052
Oh, it's from a lawyer.

869
01:04:15,085 --> 01:04:18,388
"Pursuant to your lease
of the rear unit
at 1023 Waterloo Street,

870
01:04:18,422 --> 01:04:21,625
"you are hereby given
30 days notice of eviction.

871
01:04:21,658 --> 01:04:24,394
"You will be expected
to vacate the premises
by June 30, 2005,

872
01:04:24,428 --> 01:04:25,896
-"and should
any belongings remain..."

873
01:04:29,199 --> 01:04:31,568
Tio, they want us
to leave.

874
01:04:31,601 --> 01:04:32,970
The motherfuckers.

875
01:04:33,003 --> 01:04:36,040
They want us to leave?
Why?

876
01:04:46,683 --> 01:04:48,018
Hey, puto!

877
01:04:49,686 --> 01:04:52,356
Hey, puto,
come out here, man!

878
01:04:52,389 --> 01:04:55,559
Fucking evict me, bitch.
Â¡Puta madre!

879
01:04:55,592 --> 01:04:58,095
Get the fuck out here, puto!

880
01:04:58,128 --> 01:04:59,629
What, are you
fucking scared now?

881
01:04:59,663 --> 01:05:02,566
Hey, Â¡puta madre! Cabron!

882
01:05:02,599 --> 01:05:04,601
Get the fuck out here!
Fucking punk!

883
01:05:08,172 --> 01:05:11,308
SILVIA: I told him you were
from Jalisco, and guess what.

884
01:05:11,341 --> 01:05:13,643
There's someone
on the same floor
from there too.

885
01:05:13,677 --> 01:05:15,179
WALTER: You all right
with these steps, Don Tomas?

886
01:05:15,212 --> 01:05:17,081
-It's good.
-He's fine.

887
01:05:17,114 --> 01:05:19,116
Wasn't there
anything available
on the ground floor?

888
01:05:19,149 --> 01:05:20,717
Well, you heard
the landlord.

889
01:05:20,750 --> 01:05:23,520
The elevator's going to be
working again tomorrow.

890
01:05:23,553 --> 01:05:24,688
It's not a problem.
Right, Tio?

891
01:05:24,721 --> 01:05:26,090
No problem.

892
01:05:33,597 --> 01:05:35,432
It's not bad.

893
01:05:35,465 --> 01:05:37,334
It's not bad at all.

894
01:05:37,367 --> 01:05:39,369
Look, you have
a nice big window.

895
01:05:39,403 --> 01:05:41,038
I'll fix you some curtains.

896
01:05:41,071 --> 01:05:42,372
Buttercup yellow,
to make it more cheerful?

897
01:05:45,742 --> 01:05:46,943
Needs a new coat of paint.

898
01:05:46,977 --> 01:05:50,514
Well, you can do that for him.
It'll take you all of a day.

899
01:05:50,547 --> 01:05:53,517
Tio, we're gonna have to put
some of your stuff in storage,

900
01:05:53,550 --> 01:05:57,187
but I think it will be good
to go through some
of your things.

901
01:06:00,690 --> 01:06:01,958
Tio.

902
01:07:35,785 --> 01:07:37,053
Hey.

903
01:07:40,324 --> 01:07:42,559
-No.

904
01:07:42,592 --> 01:07:44,428
Then what?

905
01:07:44,461 --> 01:07:46,663
None of my clothes
fit me anymore.

906
01:07:50,334 --> 01:07:51,801
Can't you get your folks
to give you some money?

907
01:07:51,835 --> 01:07:53,069
No.

908
01:07:55,305 --> 01:07:56,406
Well, if you really
told them what happened...

909
01:07:56,440 --> 01:07:58,508
Why should that be
so important?

910
01:07:58,542 --> 01:08:00,710
So they could hold
their heads up in the church?

911
01:08:00,744 --> 01:08:03,647
So I can be a good girl again?
It's so stupid.

912
01:08:06,483 --> 01:08:08,318
I've got a shirt.

913
01:08:08,352 --> 01:08:09,753
I don't want
your smelly shirts.

914
01:08:09,786 --> 01:08:12,088
It's extra-large.
It's brand-new.

915
01:08:38,215 --> 01:08:39,516
Come on, Joey.

916
01:08:45,522 --> 01:08:49,626
WOMAN:
We re-did all the ceilings,
got rid of the cottage cheese.

917
01:08:49,659 --> 01:08:51,461
Floors are refinished.

918
01:08:51,495 --> 01:08:54,531
The appliances are new.
Cupboards are new.

919
01:08:54,564 --> 01:08:56,933
Oh, and that's
travertine tile.

920
01:08:56,966 --> 01:08:58,568
My partner
put it in herself.

921
01:08:58,602 --> 01:09:00,904
It's beautiful.

922
01:09:00,937 --> 01:09:02,739
And you say
it's just you and your uncle.

923
01:09:02,772 --> 01:09:04,374
Uh, no,
there's three of us.

924
01:09:04,408 --> 01:09:05,709
Might be kinda cramped
for three.

925
01:09:05,742 --> 01:09:08,178
Oh, no, it's fine.
Do you take pets?

926
01:09:08,212 --> 01:09:10,680
If it's nice fellas
like those guys,
no problem.

927
01:09:11,515 --> 01:09:12,482
Great.

928
01:09:13,783 --> 01:09:15,151
It's 1600 a month.

929
01:09:17,221 --> 01:09:18,755
Wow.

930
01:09:18,788 --> 01:09:21,525
Sorry, but we've put
a lot of money into it.

931
01:09:22,359 --> 01:09:24,228
That's what I figured.

932
01:09:30,800 --> 01:09:31,901
You're not gonna make
champurrado today?

933
01:09:31,935 --> 01:09:33,270
Not today.

934
01:09:41,945 --> 01:09:43,547
Wait till later.
I'll help you out.

935
01:09:43,580 --> 01:09:44,781
Ah, don't worry.

936
01:09:46,716 --> 01:09:48,452
Okay. See you later.

937
01:09:59,929 --> 01:10:02,366
WOMAN: Yeah,
so he came, hit me...

938
01:10:02,399 --> 01:10:04,968
Did a hit and run.
Damaged this part,
dented this.

939
01:10:05,001 --> 01:10:07,371
Which means I have to
replace this and this.

940
01:10:07,404 --> 01:10:08,805
I don't know
how I'm gonna do it.

941
01:10:08,838 --> 01:10:10,440
MAN: Ah, you know what?
Don't even worry about it.

942
01:10:10,474 --> 01:10:11,741
-I got a guy
who'll take care of it.

943
01:10:11,775 --> 01:10:13,710
Carlos,
go do the Mustang.

944
01:10:13,743 --> 01:10:14,811
WOMAN: Yeah,
it's gonna be hard
to take care of.

945
01:10:14,844 --> 01:10:16,746
-Let me show you
what we got.
-Okay.

946
01:10:21,418 --> 01:10:23,687
It was just what we needed.

947
01:10:23,720 --> 01:10:27,023
Yeah, we just laid around,
went shopping a little.

948
01:10:27,056 --> 01:10:28,325
No, I love Palm Springs too.

949
01:10:41,004 --> 01:10:42,872
JAMES: It's better now.
Gary seems happier.

950
01:10:42,906 --> 01:10:45,742
He's starting a new job.
Yeah, he just...

951
01:10:45,775 --> 01:10:47,577
He had too much time
on his hands.

952
01:10:48,678 --> 01:10:51,715
It's right down there...

953
01:10:51,748 --> 01:10:54,284
What the fuck are you doing,
Carlos?

954
01:10:55,952 --> 01:10:57,521
Get him, Hector!

955
01:11:08,398 --> 01:11:11,301
Hey.
What happened?

956
01:11:11,335 --> 01:11:13,002
Did you get into
another fight?

957
01:11:13,036 --> 01:11:14,338
Yeah.

958
01:11:14,371 --> 01:11:16,072
I'll get some iodine.

959
01:11:16,105 --> 01:11:17,707
Here. Sit down.
I'll put some ice on it.

960
01:11:29,486 --> 01:11:30,620
You idiot.

961
01:11:31,888 --> 01:11:34,958
-I lost my job.
-Great.

962
01:11:34,991 --> 01:11:37,461
I needed to get out of there,
anyway.

963
01:11:37,494 --> 01:11:38,862
Shitty job.

964
01:11:38,895 --> 01:11:40,630
I thought
it was your chosen career.

965
01:11:40,664 --> 01:11:42,732
Shut up.

966
01:11:42,766 --> 01:11:45,569
I'm getting a real job
in TV as a PA.

967
01:11:46,536 --> 01:11:47,837
With your boyfriend?

968
01:11:47,871 --> 01:11:49,473
-Fuck you.
-Hold still.

969
01:11:54,010 --> 01:11:57,414
I'm gonna have to make
some more money if we're
gonna get a new place.

970
01:12:00,484 --> 01:12:01,485
I've been thinking.

971
01:12:02,786 --> 01:12:04,588
Herman's not coming back.

972
01:12:06,856 --> 01:12:08,425
Someone's gotta take care
of that kid

973
01:12:08,458 --> 01:12:10,326
and be a father to him.
Might as well be me.

974
01:12:12,696 --> 01:12:15,365
I'm gonna get a real job.

975
01:12:15,399 --> 01:12:17,701
One that's not
a total fucking dead-end.

976
01:12:20,537 --> 01:12:23,807
And you can stay in school,
and Tio Tomas can babysit.

977
01:12:23,840 --> 01:12:25,642
Yeah, right.

978
01:12:25,675 --> 01:12:26,610
I'm serious.

979
01:12:40,724 --> 01:12:42,892
Yes, I'm calling
about the apartment.

980
01:12:44,127 --> 01:12:45,629
Oh, that's too bad.

981
01:12:45,662 --> 01:12:47,431
Yeah. All right, thanks.

982
01:12:58,174 --> 01:13:00,844
I know. I know.
It's unbelievable.

983
01:13:00,877 --> 01:13:01,845
Hold on. Hold on.

984
01:13:01,878 --> 01:13:04,047
Uh, I'm the one that called
about the apartment.

985
01:13:04,080 --> 01:13:05,515
Sorry,
it's just been rented.

986
01:13:08,452 --> 01:13:11,455
-Almost 15.

987
01:13:11,488 --> 01:13:14,424
-Eighty-five.

988
01:13:14,458 --> 01:13:16,826
I don't think
it's gonna work out, chica.

989
01:13:19,863 --> 01:13:21,631
Yeah, the front unit's
have already been taken,

990
01:13:21,665 --> 01:13:23,600
but there's a place
in the back right here.

991
01:13:23,633 --> 01:13:24,601
I can let you have it
for 400.

992
01:13:38,081 --> 01:13:40,684
Look. I gotta think about
the dollars and cents here.

993
01:13:40,717 --> 01:13:42,185
I mean,
I have applications

994
01:13:42,218 --> 01:13:44,688
from three
qualified professionals
who want to rent it.

995
01:13:44,721 --> 01:13:46,956
The whole neighborhood
is the same.

996
01:13:46,990 --> 01:13:50,560
Everyone who moves in is,
well, white.

997
01:13:52,261 --> 01:13:54,664
Does he work, your uncle?

998
01:13:54,698 --> 01:13:56,633
Not really.
He sells champurrado.

999
01:13:56,666 --> 01:13:58,968
That little guy
with the clown's horn?

1000
01:13:59,002 --> 01:14:00,837
My God,
is he still around?

1001
01:14:00,870 --> 01:14:02,606
Yeah,
he's doing great.

1002
01:14:02,639 --> 01:14:04,541
He gave me
free champurrado once.

1003
01:14:04,574 --> 01:14:06,175
I don't believe this.

1004
01:14:11,715 --> 01:14:15,218
So apart from a great sense
of continuity with the past,
what else is there?

1005
01:14:15,251 --> 01:14:17,754
-Yeah.

1006
01:14:17,787 --> 01:14:21,224
The stuff
that doesn't grow on trees,
makes the world go around.

1007
01:14:21,257 --> 01:14:23,727
Well, Carlos is unemployed
right now,

1008
01:14:23,760 --> 01:14:27,931
but he's angling
for a job in TV
that pays really, really well.

1009
01:14:27,964 --> 01:14:29,198
But look,
if he does your gardening,

1010
01:14:29,232 --> 01:14:31,200
that saves you
a $100 a month.

1011
01:14:31,234 --> 01:14:34,838
I can clean your house.
That'll save you
another $100 a month.

1012
01:14:50,954 --> 01:14:52,088
Tio Tomas.

1013
01:14:54,924 --> 01:14:56,560
Carlos.

1014
01:15:04,901 --> 01:15:06,035
Tio.

1015
01:15:09,673 --> 01:15:10,607
Tio.

1016
01:15:28,224 --> 01:15:30,159
(WOMEN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY
IN SPANISH)

1017
01:15:38,702 --> 01:15:40,770
What's going on?

1018
01:15:40,804 --> 01:15:42,238
SILVIA:
It's Tio Tomas.

1019
01:15:42,271 --> 01:15:43,573
What?

1020
01:15:44,207 --> 01:15:46,042
He passed. Peacefully.

1021
01:15:48,244 --> 01:15:50,013
They took him away.

1022
01:17:01,985 --> 01:17:03,319
Look.

1023
01:17:03,352 --> 01:17:05,088
The tangerine tree.

1024
01:17:06,189 --> 01:17:08,692
Remember how sweet
the juice was?

1025
01:17:08,725 --> 01:17:10,927
I cried when they had
to chop it down.

1026
01:17:14,463 --> 01:17:17,366
Is that Aunt Lucia there?

1027
01:17:17,400 --> 01:17:19,903
Yeah. But who's that woman
with her?

1028
01:17:19,936 --> 01:17:21,204
I don't know.

1029
01:17:22,405 --> 01:17:25,074
Ah, well.

1030
01:17:25,108 --> 01:17:27,777
He had a long, happy life,
and in the end
he didn't suffer.

1031
01:17:27,811 --> 01:17:31,047
It's the way
he would've wanted it.

1032
01:17:31,080 --> 01:17:33,249
He didn't want to move
from this place.

1033
01:17:33,282 --> 01:17:34,918
SILVIA:
No, he didn't.

1034
01:17:37,420 --> 01:17:38,755
Ay, mija.

1035
01:17:43,126 --> 01:17:45,361
Look at you.
You're showing.

1036
01:17:45,394 --> 01:17:46,896
Yeah.

1037
01:18:24,200 --> 01:18:25,568
JAMES: I mean, it's kinda neat
what the guy did,

1038
01:18:25,601 --> 01:18:28,104
but put a hot tub over here
and some landscaping,
it'll look awesome.

1039
01:18:28,137 --> 01:18:29,205
Mmm-hmm.

1040
01:18:35,812 --> 01:18:37,881
JAMES:
What do we do with this?

1041
01:18:54,497 --> 01:18:55,765
Hmm?

"Tomas Alvarez was born
in Jalisco, Mexico in 1921.

"The 13th kid out of 22.

1048
01:21:05,261 --> 01:21:08,031
"When he was born,
he was so small,

1049
01:21:08,064 --> 01:21:10,499
"the midwife said
he wasn't worth washing.

1050
01:21:12,035 --> 01:21:14,270
"But he ended up
outliving all of them.

1051
01:21:15,104 --> 01:21:17,440
"In his life,

1052
01:21:17,473 --> 01:21:22,946
"he was an office boy,
a barber and a farm worker.

1053
01:21:24,647 --> 01:21:26,983
"Then in America,
he sold champurrado.

"If you walk down the street,

1056
01:21:32,688 --> 01:21:34,523
"he would stop
every two minutes
to talk to someone.

1057
01:21:37,093 --> 01:21:38,928
"They were always happy
to see him.

"He had a love inside him
that was so strong.

1059
01:21:49,038 --> 01:21:51,674
"It came from his heart
and out through his eyes
like a golden light.

1060
01:21:54,610 --> 01:21:56,512
"Everybody could see it

1061
01:21:58,181 --> 01:22:01,017
"because he loved everyone
and judged no one.

1062
01:22:04,487 --> 01:22:07,623
"At the end of my life...

1063
01:22:07,656 --> 01:22:11,995
"I'll count it
as my greatest privilege
that I knew a saint.

There's a scientific
explanation.

1070
01:23:16,125 --> 01:23:18,094
This wasn't His doing.
