1
00:00:26,559 --> 00:00:27,856
Good afternoon.

2
00:00:28,695 --> 00:00:30,094
First of all...

3
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:34,425
...I’d like to welcome you
to the celebration...

4
00:00:34,634 --> 00:00:39,628
...of this marvelous day
in a beautiful young girl's life.

5
00:00:39,906 --> 00:00:43,342
The Quinceanera of Eileen Garcia.

6
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:48,176
On this day she turns 15.

7
00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:50,638
Today...

8
00:00:51,251 --> 00:00:54,516
...she becomes a woman.

9
00:00:59,926 --> 00:01:00,950
Magdalena.

10
00:01:06,199 --> 00:01:09,635
We're gonna take another picture.
Before the picture. Hold it.

11
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:16,508
- Herman, look over here.
- Come on, fool, right here.

12
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:18,540
Look right here.

13
00:02:31,718 --> 00:02:33,049
Okay, smile now.

14
00:03:02,081 --> 00:03:03,173
No!

15
00:03:22,268 --> 00:03:23,530
Don't tell my mom.

16
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:12,345
Eileen looks really beautiful.

17
00:04:12,619 --> 00:04:15,611
- So does Magdalena.
- We have a lot to be proud of.

18
00:04:15,822 --> 00:04:18,484
Magdalena's Quinceanera
is coming up soon. When is it? July?

19
00:04:18,691 --> 00:04:19,988
No. In June.

20
00:04:21,027 --> 00:04:22,722
Get ready to pay through the nose.

21
00:04:22,996 --> 00:04:25,931
You know, Walter,
Magdalena's won't be like that.

22
00:04:26,132 --> 00:04:27,724
She's different.

23
00:04:28,668 --> 00:04:30,602
She's a more traditional girl
than Eileen.

24
00:04:30,803 --> 00:04:32,998
All right, Ernesto. If you say so.

25
00:04:55,762 --> 00:04:59,027
- Your hair looks funny like that.
- That's a nice comment.

26
00:04:59,232 --> 00:05:00,665
Just trying to make conversation.

27
00:05:00,867 --> 00:05:02,596
Don't bother.

28
00:05:10,677 --> 00:05:12,372
- So did you go with Jessica?
- No.

29
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:14,772
- Not what I heard.
- I don't care about her.

30
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:19,348
Didn't you get the text I sent you?

31
00:05:19,552 --> 00:05:21,679
Yeah. I deleted it.

32
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:43,375
Girls, do you have a chopping block
for the onions?

33
00:05:43,643 --> 00:05:46,305
There aren't any more.

34
00:05:46,546 --> 00:05:49,640
Maria, I was thinking
that I could madrina the dress...

35
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:51,316
...for Magdalena's Quinceanera.

36
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:53,849
Really? She'll be so happy.

37
00:05:54,053 --> 00:05:56,544
I could alter Eileen's to fit her.

38
00:05:56,756 --> 00:05:59,748
Thank you, sister,
you're always so good.

39
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:02,894
Silvia, I haven't seen Carlos yet.

40
00:06:03,129 --> 00:06:04,858
He's not coming.

41
00:06:05,064 --> 00:06:07,430
He's not coming
to his own sister's Quinceanera?

42
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,429
Aunt Silvia,
Uncle Walter wants you.

43
00:06:09,902 --> 00:06:12,370
Don't talk to me about that boy.

44
00:06:39,999 --> 00:06:43,025
One, two, three.

45
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:45,727
Ladies and Gentlemen...

46
00:06:45,938 --> 00:06:48,736
...thank you for coming
to Eileen's Quinceanera.

47
00:06:49,175 --> 00:06:51,735
Now it's time to dance and groove!

48
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,846
Look at the muscles on this one.

49
00:06:57,049 --> 00:06:59,517
If only I was 20 years younger!

50
00:06:59,719 --> 00:07:01,653
Forty years!

51
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:03,953
You got the urge?

52
00:07:04,157 --> 00:07:06,216
Yeah! Look! Look!

53
00:07:08,494 --> 00:07:11,554
Is Tio Tomas ready?

54
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:12,958
- Here.
- Thank you, Mama.

55
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:15,259
Thank you, mijo.

56
00:07:28,181 --> 00:07:29,739
Thank you, Junior.

57
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:36,484
Why is Tio Tomas eating worms?

58
00:07:36,722 --> 00:07:38,747
It's not worms. It's fat from the meat.

59
00:08:13,526 --> 00:08:14,515
What's up, Magdalena?

60
00:08:18,531 --> 00:08:21,625
U R STILL IN MY HEART
From: Herman

61
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:39,217
Carlos, what are you doing here?

62
00:08:39,452 --> 00:08:42,319
Happy Birthday, Hermanita.
I got that for you.

63
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:43,682
You better get out of here.

64
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:45,380
- What are you doing here?
- Nothing.

65
00:08:45,591 --> 00:08:47,058
You're trying to embarrass me.

66
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:49,524
- I told you not to be here.
- None of your business.

67
00:08:49,729 --> 00:08:52,163
You're not my son anymore!
I don't want you here.

68
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:54,458
Fuck you! It's my sister's birthday,
you asshole.

69
00:08:54,667 --> 00:08:56,862
Get out! You disgust me.
Get out of here.

70
00:08:57,103 --> 00:08:58,866
- Fuck you!
- No, Daddy, no.

71
00:09:02,241 --> 00:09:04,266
- You better get off me, man!
- Carlos!

72
00:09:05,578 --> 00:09:07,478
I'm going!

73
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:10,744
Don't do it, Carlos.
Don't ruin your sister's special day.

74
00:09:15,588 --> 00:09:17,613
I don't want to hit you again.

75
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:21,255
Carlos, go home.

76
00:09:24,263 --> 00:09:25,594
I'll see you at home.

77
00:09:32,438 --> 00:09:35,407
Let's go. Let's get back. Come on.

78
00:09:35,608 --> 00:09:38,543
Everybody, thank you for coming
to this Quinceanera.

79
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:44,343
It's a special day for a Quinceanera.

80
00:09:45,685 --> 00:09:47,619
Thank you, everybody,
for showing love.

81
00:09:58,698 --> 00:10:01,428
- Oh, my God, that was crazy.
- I know.

82
00:10:01,667 --> 00:10:03,897
He hit him so hard.

83
00:10:04,303 --> 00:10:06,464
First of all, a family party
and that happens.

84
00:10:06,872 --> 00:10:09,170
I was kind of embarrassed.
That's my cousin. Come on.

85
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:11,433
It's her big day, her Quinceanera.

86
00:10:11,677 --> 00:10:13,235
Did you see her at the end?
Her face?

87
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:16,813
She'd been crying and her mascara
was smeared everywhere.

88
00:10:17,049 --> 00:10:19,813
- Carlos is so stupid to do that.
- He shouldn't have been there.

89
00:10:20,052 --> 00:10:21,485
Exactly. It's her Quinceanera.

90
00:10:21,721 --> 00:10:23,018
- Oh, my God.
- What is it?

91
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:24,586
- Look.
- Who is it?

92
00:10:24,857 --> 00:10:26,222
It's Herman.

93
00:10:26,425 --> 00:10:28,188
Look at you. You're going all red.

94
00:10:28,394 --> 00:10:29,486
Shut up.

95
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:03,826
They kicked him out
of the house, why?

96
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:06,289
He didn't say.

97
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:08,023
Neither would Silvia. I asked her.

98
00:11:08,234 --> 00:11:10,065
Here he is.

99
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:13,828
Oh, my God. Carlos, look at you.
You're going to spoil your looks.

100
00:11:14,106 --> 00:11:16,074
- Let me clean you up.
- I'm cool, Tia.

101
00:11:16,409 --> 00:11:19,537
- Come on, it's late.
- Let me take care of him.

102
00:11:20,579 --> 00:11:22,672
Candy, let's go.

103
00:11:23,382 --> 00:11:24,815
Bye, Tio.

104
00:11:32,124 --> 00:11:33,853
You will live.

105
00:11:41,801 --> 00:11:43,291
Come in.

106
00:11:44,837 --> 00:11:46,828
I'm glad you're still awake.

107
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:50,267
I hardly got to see you all day.

108
00:11:51,143 --> 00:11:52,303
You have fun?

109
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,776
It was a beautiful Quinceanera.

110
00:11:56,982 --> 00:11:58,540
Oh, well, except for the end.

111
00:11:58,751 --> 00:12:01,743
But Eileen's dress was beautiful,
wasn't it?

112
00:12:01,954 --> 00:12:03,046
Yeah, it was beautiful.

113
00:12:03,422 --> 00:12:06,914
Aunt Silvia said she would alter it
for your Quinceanera.

114
00:12:07,126 --> 00:12:08,889
- That's nice.
- What do you mean "nice"?

115
00:12:09,095 --> 00:12:10,357
It was a wonderful dress.

116
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:12,224
I know, Mom, but...

117
00:12:13,466 --> 00:12:15,434
I wanted a new dress
for my Quinceanera.

118
00:12:15,801 --> 00:12:18,326
Well, your father
is not Uncle Walter.

119
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:20,539
He doesn't have money
to throw around.

120
00:12:24,143 --> 00:12:25,371
Can I get a Hummer limo?

121
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:26,840
What?

122
00:12:27,046 --> 00:12:29,571
If we save money with the dress,
can I get a Hummer limo?

123
00:12:29,782 --> 00:12:31,215
The same one that Eileen had.

124
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:33,647
Where do you get these ideas?

125
00:12:33,853 --> 00:12:35,480
Please.

126
00:12:35,688 --> 00:12:37,713
Just talk to Dad
about it for me, please.

127
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:39,322
Promise me.

128
00:12:40,326 --> 00:12:42,089
Thanks, Mama.

129
00:13:39,685 --> 00:13:40,652
Hello.

130
00:13:40,853 --> 00:13:43,253
I got the rent check.
Thanks so much.

131
00:14:01,407 --> 00:14:04,137
Champurrado!

132
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:11,409
Here you are, honey.
Put your money there, will you?

133
00:14:12,818 --> 00:14:15,810
Tio Tomas, when will you give me
the recipe for the champurrados?

134
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:18,046
When you get as old as me, honey.

135
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:22,018
- Here you are, beautiful.
- Thank you.

136
00:14:22,228 --> 00:14:24,594
Oh, my gosh.
I so need to go spring shopping.

137
00:14:24,997 --> 00:14:28,433
- It's starting to get hot.
- I need new skirts and stuff.

138
00:14:28,634 --> 00:14:30,534
I really want to go to the beach.

139
00:14:30,769 --> 00:14:32,236
We'll get bathing suits!

140
00:14:32,438 --> 00:14:35,805
With cute little sandals to match
those cute little purses.

141
00:14:36,008 --> 00:14:41,207
And cute little tops.
We need sandals, skirts, tops...

142
00:14:41,413 --> 00:14:43,506
Remember the purple top
that Sandra had on?

143
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:46,742
- I saw that.
- She thought she was all bling-bling.

144
00:14:46,952 --> 00:14:49,045
I saw that shirt on sale
at Target for 9.99.

145
00:14:50,089 --> 00:14:51,954
- I swear to God. No lie.
- What else?

146
00:14:52,157 --> 00:14:53,590
Let's take the bus there and see.

147
00:14:53,792 --> 00:14:56,260
- Yeah, sure.
- Yeah, all right. Let me call my mom.

148
00:14:56,495 --> 00:14:58,725
Actually, I gotta get going.
See you ladies later.

149
00:14:58,931 --> 00:15:00,523
- Bye.
- Bye, girl.

150
00:15:02,635 --> 00:15:05,126
- Hey, Mom. I'm fine.
- I really need makeup.

151
00:15:05,371 --> 00:15:08,829
Me and some girls are going
to take the bus to Glendale...

152
00:15:09,108 --> 00:15:10,700
...and go shopping.

153
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:13,242
Yeah, sure, I'll be home
in plenty of time.

154
00:15:37,503 --> 00:15:41,872
If you could time travel to any period
in time, where would you go?

155
00:15:42,374 --> 00:15:46,003
I'd go way, way back.
Probably to Jesus' time or something.

156
00:15:46,245 --> 00:15:47,803
- Really?
- Yeah.

157
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:50,514
People have so many different
versions of the Bible.

158
00:15:50,716 --> 00:15:54,049
I'd like to go back
and see what really happened.

159
00:15:54,253 --> 00:15:55,550
You know what that says?

160
00:15:56,522 --> 00:15:59,389
- Herman loves Jessica.
- It says Magdalena.

161
00:16:00,859 --> 00:16:02,224
What time would you go to?

162
00:16:02,861 --> 00:16:06,991
Nineteenth-century France.
All those painters and shit.

163
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:10,362
I want to hang out with Van Gogh,
tell him he's gonna be a big hit.

164
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:13,998
- You're so weird.
- I know.

165
00:16:23,382 --> 00:16:25,748
You know before, what happened...

166
00:16:25,951 --> 00:16:27,646
I never meant to disrespect you.

167
00:16:27,853 --> 00:16:29,150
You didn't.

168
00:16:29,355 --> 00:16:30,720
No?

169
00:16:31,557 --> 00:16:35,186
So it was okay, what we did?

170
00:16:35,894 --> 00:16:36,861
It was okay.

171
00:16:38,864 --> 00:16:40,354
Cool.

172
00:16:50,809 --> 00:16:52,333
So why did you get so mad at me?

173
00:16:52,544 --> 00:16:53,841
You were after stupid Jessica.

174
00:16:54,046 --> 00:16:56,139
I wasn't.
That's just you being crazy.

175
00:16:56,348 --> 00:16:58,816
- Yeah?
- She likes me.

176
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:01,543
But I can't stand her. I swear.

177
00:17:04,656 --> 00:17:05,918
Try and catch me.

178
00:17:06,925 --> 00:17:08,415
Herman.

179
00:17:15,501 --> 00:17:17,594
- Your titties are so big.
- Shut up.

180
00:17:18,103 --> 00:17:20,731
They are.
Nearly as big as Jessica's.

181
00:17:20,939 --> 00:17:22,804
Shut up!

182
00:17:25,511 --> 00:17:27,103
- I missed you.
- Good.

183
00:17:27,312 --> 00:17:29,906
- Did you miss me?
- No.

184
00:17:33,619 --> 00:17:35,519
You're so beautiful.

185
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:41,756
- I like you so much.
- Herman.

186
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,518
I do.

187
00:17:45,197 --> 00:17:47,495
- Feel that.
- No.

188
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:49,425
Come on.

189
00:17:53,138 --> 00:17:54,628
I love you.

190
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:04,677
This thing's not gonna work.

191
00:18:04,883 --> 00:18:07,283
That's the only one we have.

192
00:18:08,353 --> 00:18:09,342
Sorry I'm late, Tio.

193
00:18:09,621 --> 00:18:11,248
They thought
you weren't coming today.

194
00:18:11,457 --> 00:18:13,789
Oh, no. Come here, buddy.

195
00:18:13,992 --> 00:18:14,959
I'll get the leashes.

196
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,457
Okay.

197
00:18:16,662 --> 00:18:18,289
- Don't I get a hello?
- Hello.

198
00:18:18,497 --> 00:18:21,489
Gee, thanks. What's up with you?

199
00:18:22,501 --> 00:18:24,093
Nothing.

200
00:18:25,504 --> 00:18:28,268
Eileen told me
some things about you.

201
00:18:28,907 --> 00:18:31,671
- What things?
- Just things.

202
00:18:33,378 --> 00:18:35,471
And don't let them shit
on the Hernandez's lawn.

203
00:18:35,881 --> 00:18:37,473
All right. Come on, boys.

204
00:18:37,683 --> 00:18:39,708
This time take them for more
than five minutes.

205
00:18:39,918 --> 00:18:41,180
Yes, Tio Tomas.

206
00:18:49,328 --> 00:18:52,229
Yeah, we're landlords now.
It's two units.

207
00:18:52,531 --> 00:18:55,796
There's ours and then this place
in the back where this old guy lives.

208
00:18:56,001 --> 00:18:57,696
Yeah, the rate was good
It's a 30-year.

209
00:18:57,903 --> 00:19:00,667
But it's still a shitload
of money per month.

210
00:19:02,841 --> 00:19:06,470
There's a super hot cholo coming up
the back stairs wearing a wife beater.

211
00:19:06,678 --> 00:19:09,875
James! James, the back door.

212
00:19:10,782 --> 00:19:11,874
Hello.

213
00:19:12,084 --> 00:19:15,076
- You guys got an adjustable wrench?
- A what?

214
00:19:15,287 --> 00:19:17,653
An adjustable wrench
for the garbage disposal.

215
00:19:18,624 --> 00:19:20,057
Oh, you live in the back with...

216
00:19:20,359 --> 00:19:23,157
- Tomas.
- Tomas, right. Yeah, come on in.

217
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:27,328
So, Tomas is what?
Your grandfather?

218
00:19:27,566 --> 00:19:29,557
No, he's my uncle.

219
00:19:30,269 --> 00:19:34,603
That garden he planted is really
unbelievable. How old is he?

220
00:19:34,806 --> 00:19:37,832
Eighty-three, four.
He's my great-great-uncle.

221
00:19:38,043 --> 00:19:39,567
He's lived back there a long time?

222
00:19:39,778 --> 00:19:42,713
Yeah, a real long time.
Since before I was born.

223
00:19:42,915 --> 00:19:44,212
Well, how old are you?

224
00:19:45,784 --> 00:19:47,513
Old enough.

225
00:19:49,288 --> 00:19:52,416
- I knew it was in the truck.
- I never said it wasn't.

226
00:19:52,824 --> 00:19:54,587
All right. Will this do?

227
00:19:55,227 --> 00:19:58,594
Yeah, it's cool. Thanks, guys.
I'll get it back to you guys later.

228
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:00,730
- No worries.
- Oh, hey, Carlos.

229
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:04,368
We're having a housewarming party
a week from Saturday.

230
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:05,537
Do you want to come?

231
00:20:06,405 --> 00:20:08,873
- What time?
- Nine, 9:30.

232
00:20:10,342 --> 00:20:14,836
I've got some things
I'm supposed to do, but we'll see.

233
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:18,039
- Cool.
- See you later, dude.

234
00:20:19,685 --> 00:20:22,552
- Are you crazy?
- Trust me.

235
00:20:30,028 --> 00:20:32,553
Yeah, that's good. Perfect.

236
00:20:32,764 --> 00:20:33,890
That's it. Yeah.

237
00:20:36,702 --> 00:20:38,636
Now you're getting the hang of it.

238
00:20:38,837 --> 00:20:41,237
But she's stepping on me.

239
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,774
So why are you putting
your feet here?

240
00:20:44,509 --> 00:20:46,306
That's the way.

241
00:20:54,353 --> 00:20:55,752
Oh, Lord.

242
00:20:58,857 --> 00:21:01,121
Magdalena's starting
to look so grown up.

243
00:21:01,326 --> 00:21:02,725
I know.

244
00:21:03,128 --> 00:21:05,824
Walter and Silvia offered
to padrino the DJ.

245
00:21:06,398 --> 00:21:08,992
That's nice.

246
00:21:10,335 --> 00:21:13,168
But there's still
the problem of the car.

247
00:21:14,406 --> 00:21:16,397
I told you already.

248
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:18,337
I know, but we have
everything else now.

249
00:21:18,543 --> 00:21:19,976
The answer is no.

250
00:21:20,178 --> 00:21:21,167
But it's her big day.

251
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:22,540
Exactly.

252
00:21:22,748 --> 00:21:25,273
It's a milestone in her spiritual life.

253
00:21:25,484 --> 00:21:29,648
And if all that means is riding
in a Hummer limo...

254
00:21:29,855 --> 00:21:33,347
...trying to keep up with Eileen,
then God help her.

255
00:21:36,595 --> 00:21:39,086
I don't understand what
the problem is. It wasn't much.

256
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:42,290
Five hundred dollars
for the afternoon, driver included.

257
00:21:42,668 --> 00:21:45,159
Ask one of the cousins.
I'm sure someone will padrino it.

258
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:47,463
I don't know.
He hates the whole idea.

259
00:21:47,706 --> 00:21:51,506
That's your father, isn't it?
A good man, a holy man...

260
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:53,268
...but with his head in the clouds.

261
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:57,141
Some of us here on Earth,
we like a little luxury now and then.

262
00:21:58,016 --> 00:22:02,043
Okay. Put your shoulders down.
You're a pretty girl.

263
00:22:02,254 --> 00:22:06,816
Neck, 14 and a half.
Chest, 33 and a half. Waist, 31.

264
00:22:07,059 --> 00:22:09,892
- Hips, 36 and a half.
- What? That's so big.

265
00:22:10,128 --> 00:22:12,722
I know. I thought you'd be
smaller than Eileen.

266
00:22:13,432 --> 00:22:15,297
Congratulations,
you're in the running...

267
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,832
...for America's Next Top Model.
- Thank you.

268
00:22:18,036 --> 00:22:21,494
The next name that
I'm going to call, Christina.

269
00:22:21,707 --> 00:22:23,834
Jasiel, how many tamales
do you want?

270
00:22:24,109 --> 00:22:25,235
Three.

271
00:22:25,444 --> 00:22:26,843
And you, Magdalena?

272
00:22:27,045 --> 00:22:28,774
It's okay, Mom. I'm not hungry.

273
00:22:29,214 --> 00:22:32,411
You learned a new trick today.
Congratulations.

274
00:22:33,552 --> 00:22:36,419
Here, Joey, here, Arthur.

275
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:46,789
Don't you want to take a jacket?
It's cold out.

276
00:22:46,998 --> 00:22:49,626
No. I'm not going far.

277
00:22:49,835 --> 00:22:51,462
Okay.

278
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:54,867
Here, Joey. Here you go.

279
00:23:12,391 --> 00:23:15,360
- So echinacea...
- Hey.

280
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:19,462
- I told you before.
- I know. I know.

281
00:23:31,977 --> 00:23:35,879
- So how long have you been in L.A.?
- Two weeks.

282
00:23:36,848 --> 00:23:38,941
Hey, dude. What's up?
Glad you could make it.

283
00:23:39,151 --> 00:23:40,846
- Thanks.
- You want a drink or something?

284
00:23:41,052 --> 00:23:42,952
- Yeah.
- Come on.

285
00:23:51,196 --> 00:23:52,857
Tony, this is Carlos. Carlos, Tony.

286
00:23:53,732 --> 00:23:56,360
- What can I get you?
- Beer's fine.

287
00:24:00,806 --> 00:24:01,932
- Cheers.
- Wow, James.

288
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:03,573
Congratulations on the new place.

289
00:24:03,775 --> 00:24:05,834
Thanks. Come.
I want you to meet some friends.

290
00:24:06,044 --> 00:24:07,534
Carlos, this is Stephen and Simon.

291
00:24:07,746 --> 00:24:09,270
- Hey, Carlos.
- What's going on?

292
00:24:09,481 --> 00:24:12,211
We've been looking around here
and when something comes up...

293
00:24:12,484 --> 00:24:14,076
...people are bidding over asking.

294
00:24:14,286 --> 00:24:15,878
I know. This area's hot right now.

295
00:24:16,154 --> 00:24:18,884
It's so hot. We were looking at
a place a couple years ago.

296
00:24:19,357 --> 00:24:21,382
But Stephen was concerned
about the crime.

297
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:23,252
- No, I wasn't.
- Yes, he was.

298
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:26,693
That place went back on the market
and doubled in two years.

299
00:24:26,932 --> 00:24:29,958
Let's hope it keeps up. You have
no idea how much we paid for this.

300
00:24:57,863 --> 00:24:59,330
I'm wasted.

301
00:25:04,436 --> 00:25:05,733
I want you to meet somebody.

302
00:25:05,937 --> 00:25:08,269
Hey, Carlos, this is Alejandro.
Alejandro, Carlos.

303
00:25:08,473 --> 00:25:10,373
- What's up?
- Carlos lives in the back house.

304
00:25:10,575 --> 00:25:13,169
- Where are the limes?
- I'll be right back.

305
00:25:21,052 --> 00:25:22,542
Do you know anyone here?

306
00:25:22,821 --> 00:25:25,847
No one. Just James and Gary.

307
00:25:27,225 --> 00:25:30,353
- They're nice guys.
- Yeah.

308
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:32,360
They love their Latin boys.

309
00:25:36,167 --> 00:25:37,225
Shots!

310
00:25:37,435 --> 00:25:40,268
- Hook it up.
- Yes. Please.

311
00:26:05,931 --> 00:26:09,128
- Oh, it's a good one.
- Let's have a look. Cool.

312
00:26:09,334 --> 00:26:10,926
See?

313
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:13,960
Cool.

314
00:26:15,674 --> 00:26:17,574
You can zoom in.

315
00:26:18,443 --> 00:26:19,501
I am so fucked up.

316
00:26:23,181 --> 00:26:26,548
- Is that a tattoo?
- Yeah.

317
00:26:29,721 --> 00:26:32,315
- "Travieso"?
- Travieso.

318
00:26:33,058 --> 00:26:34,457
What's that mean?

319
00:26:36,161 --> 00:26:38,686
- It means troublemaker.
- Really?

320
00:26:49,007 --> 00:26:50,804
Feel good?

321
00:26:51,009 --> 00:26:52,533
Sure.

322
00:27:19,904 --> 00:27:22,600
It looks like the opening
for one of those bad novellas.

323
00:27:22,807 --> 00:27:24,638
I know.

324
00:27:27,512 --> 00:27:31,039
- Wow. You have bells and everything.
- I know.

325
00:27:33,752 --> 00:27:36,243
May? That's your middle name?
I didn't know that.

326
00:27:36,454 --> 00:27:39,150
- You know that.
- No.

327
00:27:39,357 --> 00:27:40,551
Wow, that looks good.

328
00:27:40,759 --> 00:27:42,522
Is that a cake or a pillow
or what is it?

329
00:27:43,028 --> 00:27:44,552
Cardboard.

330
00:27:47,198 --> 00:27:48,927
You look cute.

331
00:27:50,101 --> 00:27:52,160
You didn't have a tiara
on in your Quinceanera.

332
00:27:52,370 --> 00:27:54,463
I know. I broke it
on the way to church.

333
00:27:54,673 --> 00:27:57,005
- You did?
- Yeah.

334
00:27:57,542 --> 00:28:00,409
- Your hair's cute.
- Thanks.

335
00:28:00,612 --> 00:28:02,546
Those flowers are nice.

336
00:28:05,083 --> 00:28:08,382
It looks like you're looking for bugs.

337
00:28:08,586 --> 00:28:10,349
It looks like there is a bug.
You see it?

338
00:28:10,555 --> 00:28:12,546
Oh, yeah. That's right.

339
00:28:12,757 --> 00:28:15,021
Okay, it's not just me.

340
00:28:17,262 --> 00:28:20,163
Oh, the dress.

341
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:27,971
That was cute.

342
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:32,407
It would help if you actually
applied it on your face.

343
00:28:33,311 --> 00:28:34,778
She's putting it on the air.

344
00:28:34,979 --> 00:28:37,709
- She has her whole face on.
- Her facial expression is like...

345
00:28:37,916 --> 00:28:40,544
- You do not need more lip gloss.
- Oh, I know.

346
00:28:40,752 --> 00:28:42,686
Lips all shiny.

347
00:28:42,887 --> 00:28:45,583
So pretty.

348
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:47,849
Tia Silvia looks pissed.

349
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:51,119
I can't tell if she's gonna cry or smack
the crap out of you.

350
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:01,402
- Your dress is really pretty.
- Thanks.

351
00:29:01,606 --> 00:29:03,597
My mom's supposed to alter it
for Magdalena.

352
00:29:03,808 --> 00:29:05,639
Aren't you the same size?

353
00:29:05,844 --> 00:29:08,904
Almost. She just has
to take it out a little bit.

354
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:21,085
In history they're signing up people
for a trip to Germany next spring.

355
00:29:21,359 --> 00:29:24,419
- You gonna go?
- Yeah, if I win the lottery.

356
00:29:24,629 --> 00:29:26,221
What do you wanna go there for?

357
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:29,059
I wanna see the world.
I wanna travel.

358
00:29:29,267 --> 00:29:32,065
I mean, I'm sick of Echo Park.

359
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:34,568
I know every building,
I know every piece of grass.

360
00:29:34,806 --> 00:29:36,637
I'm sick of it too.

361
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:38,906
What's wrong?

362
00:29:39,878 --> 00:29:42,403
- Nothing.
- Really?

363
00:29:42,614 --> 00:29:45,139
If I tell you, you'll think
I'm stupid and superficial.

364
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:47,045
- I won't.
- Yes, you will.

365
00:29:47,252 --> 00:29:49,277
Come on. Tell me.

366
00:29:49,487 --> 00:29:51,751
It's my dad. He's being a real jerk.

367
00:29:51,956 --> 00:29:55,016
- About the Hummer limo?
- Yeah.

368
00:29:56,127 --> 00:29:58,527
- I knew I shouldn't have told you.
- It's okay.

369
00:29:58,730 --> 00:30:00,561
I mean, I know it means a lot to you.

370
00:30:00,765 --> 00:30:02,892
Don't make like you understand me.
You don't.

371
00:30:03,101 --> 00:30:04,796
You don't have
to go through this crap.

372
00:30:05,003 --> 00:30:06,265
Okay. I'm sorry.

373
00:30:08,406 --> 00:30:10,772
I'm sorry. I don't mean to be a bitch.

374
00:30:11,342 --> 00:30:13,139
It's okay.

375
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:19,177
Here you go.
Twenty minutes in the oven on 400.

376
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:22,411
Okay. Thanks, Mom.

377
00:30:22,687 --> 00:30:24,985
And I'll be back from work
about midnight.

378
00:30:27,158 --> 00:30:29,353
Before you go,
can I ask you something?

379
00:30:30,094 --> 00:30:32,961
There's this girl, a friend,
her Quinceanera's coming up...

380
00:30:33,164 --> 00:30:36,656
...and I thought maybe Uncle Hector
could get us a deal on a Hummer.

381
00:30:36,868 --> 00:30:37,835
Who is this girl?

382
00:30:38,036 --> 00:30:39,901
- Just a friend.
- Oh, really?

383
00:30:40,104 --> 00:30:43,130
It's not like that, Mom.
She's the preacher's daughter.

384
00:30:43,341 --> 00:30:46,037
I don't care
whose daughter she is, mijo.

385
00:30:46,244 --> 00:30:48,804
- You have school to think about, okay?
- Okay.

386
00:30:49,614 --> 00:30:52,048
Besides, Uncle Hector,
he just works for the company.

387
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:53,979
He can't set the prices.

388
00:31:14,205 --> 00:31:16,173
Did you see
your friends again tonight?

389
00:31:16,374 --> 00:31:18,672
- Yeah.
- That's nice.

390
00:31:20,511 --> 00:31:22,001
Yeah.

391
00:31:24,816 --> 00:31:26,613
- Hey, Tio.
- Yeah.

392
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:32,621
- Ever think about getting married?
- Yeah.

393
00:31:32,824 --> 00:31:35,224
I've had a couple of close calls.

394
00:31:36,527 --> 00:31:40,122
- Where? Was it here or back in...?
- No, back in Mexico.

395
00:31:40,331 --> 00:31:43,926
There was one. Maria Epifania.

396
00:31:45,069 --> 00:31:48,561
We worked in the same office.
Different floors.

397
00:31:48,773 --> 00:31:53,369
I thought about her a lot.
All the time.

398
00:31:54,345 --> 00:31:55,437
She liked you?

399
00:31:55,647 --> 00:31:57,205
Yeah, I think she did.

400
00:31:57,415 --> 00:32:00,009
- And you liked her?
- Oh, yeah.

401
00:32:00,218 --> 00:32:04,951
She was a very sweet,
a very beautiful girl.

402
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:07,323
What happened?

403
00:32:07,525 --> 00:32:11,723
We saw each other a few times.
But I couldn't afford very much.

404
00:32:12,196 --> 00:32:16,292
And then my mother become ill.
Very ill.

405
00:32:16,901 --> 00:32:20,735
And I had to move back to the ranch
near Tepatitlan, Jalisco...

406
00:32:20,939 --> 00:32:23,237
...and take care of her.

407
00:32:23,441 --> 00:32:25,136
So I just couldn't.

408
00:32:29,714 --> 00:32:31,648
Yeah, that's messed up.

409
00:32:31,849 --> 00:32:33,373
Yeah.

410
00:33:14,959 --> 00:33:18,417
I'm telling you, these are just the most
rocking tamales in Echo Park.

411
00:33:18,629 --> 00:33:20,790
We'll see about that.

412
00:33:21,766 --> 00:33:24,360
Can I put it in the back?
I don't want it to get dirty.

413
00:33:24,569 --> 00:33:26,161
Okay.

414
00:33:30,508 --> 00:33:31,975
You added a lot of extra flowers.

415
00:33:32,176 --> 00:33:34,406
No, I didn't. I moved a few around.

416
00:33:34,612 --> 00:33:35,943
It looks beautiful.

417
00:33:42,353 --> 00:33:46,119
Go try it on.
We're all waiting. Go, go, go.

418
00:33:47,759 --> 00:33:50,626
The amount of work I did on it.

419
00:33:52,697 --> 00:33:54,756
Okay, breathe in.

420
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:57,695
Breathe in.

421
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,299
Oh, it looks beautiful.

422
00:34:06,411 --> 00:34:08,675
But it looks a little tight.

423
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,507
I think it needs to be adjusted.

424
00:34:10,715 --> 00:34:11,875
Turn around.

425
00:34:14,018 --> 00:34:15,713
You've gotten
the measurements wrong.

426
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:17,444
I did not.

427
00:34:18,156 --> 00:34:20,818
We'll let out the seam
and it will be fine.

428
00:34:25,696 --> 00:34:28,722
- Has she been eating a lot lately?
- No.

429
00:34:28,933 --> 00:34:31,800
- Maria, I hope that I'm wrong.
- What?

430
00:34:32,904 --> 00:34:36,601
No one could've brought up a girl
better than you brought up Magdalena.

431
00:34:36,808 --> 00:34:38,742
- No one.
- Mom.

432
00:34:47,585 --> 00:34:49,519
14 years old.

433
00:35:01,165 --> 00:35:02,894
You'll need an extra blanket.

434
00:35:09,774 --> 00:35:11,742
It's getting cold tonight.

435
00:35:17,915 --> 00:35:19,405
What?

436
00:35:23,721 --> 00:35:25,484
Have you been with Herman?

437
00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:27,521
No, Mom,
I haven't been with Herman.

438
00:35:27,725 --> 00:35:30,888
- I mean, having relations with...
- No.

439
00:35:31,095 --> 00:35:32,585
- Or any other boys?
- Mom!

440
00:35:33,331 --> 00:35:35,561
I know. I'm sorry.

441
00:35:41,305 --> 00:35:45,799
When was the last time
you had your monthly visitor?

442
00:36:35,826 --> 00:36:38,761
How could this happen?
How could you have let this happen?

443
00:36:38,963 --> 00:36:41,090
- I didn't know.
- You knew there was a boy.

444
00:36:41,299 --> 00:36:43,392
Someone she'd mentioned
once or twice.

445
00:36:43,601 --> 00:36:45,193
I didn't think it was anything.

446
00:36:45,403 --> 00:36:47,803
- You kept it from me.
- I didn't think it was important.

447
00:36:48,005 --> 00:36:50,803
Not important! Damn it, woman,
what do you think is important?

448
00:36:51,008 --> 00:36:52,942
Look at the state she is in now!

449
00:36:53,144 --> 00:36:54,736
Papa.

450
00:36:57,448 --> 00:36:58,881
Go away.

451
00:36:59,083 --> 00:37:00,448
It's not what you think.

452
00:37:00,651 --> 00:37:02,346
How do you think
your mother feels now?

453
00:37:03,521 --> 00:37:05,682
The shame that you brought
on this house!

454
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:08,017
And on the church.

455
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:10,626
- The test is wrong.
- No, the test is not wrong!

456
00:37:10,828 --> 00:37:11,522
It is!

457
00:37:11,662 --> 00:37:13,960
He that committeth fornication
sinneth against his own body.

458
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:16,530
I'm telling you,
I haven't been with a boy!

459
00:37:17,134 --> 00:37:20,968
You liar! You are so full of sin
that you can't admit the truth.

460
00:37:21,172 --> 00:37:23,868
Not even when your wickedness is
in front of you for the world to see.

461
00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:25,201
Why aren't you listening?

462
00:37:25,409 --> 00:37:27,775
Go to your room.
Let me handle this.

463
00:37:27,979 --> 00:37:31,005
Go! I don't want to look at you!

464
00:38:39,383 --> 00:38:40,850
- Hey.
- What's up?

465
00:38:41,052 --> 00:38:43,646
Nothing. I'm just digging the yard.

466
00:38:43,854 --> 00:38:46,220
- In between jobs.
- Yeah?

467
00:38:46,424 --> 00:38:50,451
Yeah, I work in TV,
so it's feast or famine.

468
00:38:50,661 --> 00:38:51,787
Cool.

469
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:53,854
What are you up to?

470
00:38:54,065 --> 00:38:55,259
Nothing. Just got off work.

471
00:38:55,466 --> 00:38:57,957
- Oh, yeah? Where do you work?
- At the car wash.

472
00:39:01,639 --> 00:39:03,334
So you're from London?

473
00:39:04,308 --> 00:39:05,332
Yes.

474
00:39:05,543 --> 00:39:09,001
- Like this?
- No, it's like this:

475
00:39:09,213 --> 00:39:10,771
This one's an E.

476
00:39:11,716 --> 00:39:13,513
This one's a P.

477
00:39:15,486 --> 00:39:18,011
- Echo Parque.
- Echo Parque.

478
00:39:20,091 --> 00:39:22,321
Be careful. Don't flash that
around Temple Street.

479
00:39:22,526 --> 00:39:25,893
- They're the rival gang, right?
- They'd kill you.

480
00:39:26,097 --> 00:39:29,498
Wow. You really live
in a whole other world, don't you?

481
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:32,635
No. You do.

482
00:39:40,411 --> 00:39:42,072
You know,
we should wait for James.

483
00:39:52,189 --> 00:39:54,783
She's fine.

484
00:39:55,126 --> 00:39:57,151
It's no big deal.

485
00:39:57,361 --> 00:40:01,923
I couldn't sleep all night.
She's my only daughter.

486
00:40:02,133 --> 00:40:05,159
But Ernesto.
You know what he's like.

487
00:40:05,369 --> 00:40:08,770
He's bull-headed,
but he's a good man.

488
00:40:09,306 --> 00:40:11,740
Give him time
and he'll come around.

489
00:40:12,109 --> 00:40:16,375
And meanwhile don't worry.
She's safe with me.

490
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:30,850
Hey, boys.

491
00:40:31,061 --> 00:40:34,155
Come here. Come here, boy.

492
00:40:43,207 --> 00:40:45,539
- Hey.
- Carlos.

493
00:40:45,743 --> 00:40:47,438
I can make tea.
Would you like some?

494
00:40:47,645 --> 00:40:49,806
No, I'm straight.
What's up with you?

495
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:53,307
- Nothing.
- Leave her alone.

496
00:40:57,955 --> 00:40:59,820
Did you see the boys
playing basketball today?

497
00:41:00,024 --> 00:41:02,049
- Yes, I did.
- Oh, my gosh.

498
00:41:02,259 --> 00:41:04,352
Manuel had his head shaved.
Did you see?

499
00:41:04,562 --> 00:41:06,086
- What did it look like?
- Horrible.

500
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:08,060
It looks like he has leukemia.

501
00:41:08,265 --> 00:41:09,892
I think short hair is sexy.

502
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:12,330
But his head is so weird.
He looks like E.T.

503
00:41:12,536 --> 00:41:15,334
I think that boy's too skinny.
He needs to put some weight on.

504
00:41:15,573 --> 00:41:17,564
- Hey.
- Hi.

505
00:41:17,775 --> 00:41:18,764
- Hi.
- Hi.

506
00:41:18,976 --> 00:41:21,274
- You ready?
- Yeah.

507
00:41:22,913 --> 00:41:24,380
I'll see you girls later.

508
00:41:24,582 --> 00:41:25,776
Bye.

509
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:32,753
- I like them bald. Shaved.
- Some guys can pull it off.

510
00:41:32,957 --> 00:41:34,652
Yeah, well, that's what I like.

511
00:41:36,727 --> 00:41:41,027
So you moved in with your uncle?
Why did you do that?

512
00:41:41,232 --> 00:41:44,065
It's closer to school.
It means I can walk.

513
00:41:44,268 --> 00:41:47,726
- It's not closer.
- It is.

514
00:41:47,938 --> 00:41:50,270
Did you get in a fight with your dad?

515
00:41:52,443 --> 00:41:54,673
Was it about the Hummer limo?

516
00:41:57,047 --> 00:41:58,571
Come here.

517
00:42:12,029 --> 00:42:13,223
I'm gonna have a baby.

518
00:42:13,430 --> 00:42:14,920
- Yeah, right.
- I am.

519
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:16,223
You can't be.

520
00:42:16,467 --> 00:42:18,435
I did the test. I did it twice.

521
00:42:19,703 --> 00:42:21,603
- Who's the father?
- You.

522
00:42:21,805 --> 00:42:23,864
That's not possible.

523
00:42:24,074 --> 00:42:25,666
I know.

524
00:42:26,877 --> 00:42:28,902
- But we never...
- I know that.

525
00:42:31,148 --> 00:42:34,914
But the baby's there and I've never
been with anybody else.

526
00:42:38,455 --> 00:42:40,389
You don't believe me.

527
00:42:53,170 --> 00:42:56,298
Did you hear that Maria Elena
is moving to Sylmar?

528
00:42:56,507 --> 00:42:57,769
Is she moving?

529
00:42:57,975 --> 00:42:59,499
See how much they're asking for?

530
00:43:00,144 --> 00:43:02,044
The neighborhood is sure changing,
isn't it?

531
00:43:02,279 --> 00:43:03,610
So fast.

532
00:43:03,814 --> 00:43:05,577
Here you are.

533
00:43:18,162 --> 00:43:19,925
Carlos, get your feet off the sofa.

534
00:43:20,197 --> 00:43:22,893
- It's my house. I can do what I want.
- It's my house now too.

535
00:43:23,133 --> 00:43:24,259
Fuck you.

536
00:43:24,501 --> 00:43:26,594
I have to sleep there
and your boots are dirty.

537
00:43:26,804 --> 00:43:28,294
So?

538
00:43:52,963 --> 00:43:54,294
I know why you're here.

539
00:43:54,498 --> 00:43:56,489
And I'm sorry you wasted your time.

540
00:43:56,700 --> 00:44:02,229
I just think you two should talk.

541
00:44:02,439 --> 00:44:05,465
When she's ready to confess her sin,
I'll talk. Not until then.

542
00:44:05,843 --> 00:44:09,779
Magdalena is very strong-headed.
You know what she's like.

543
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:11,948
I used to know her.

544
00:44:12,916 --> 00:44:16,010
She's still the same.

545
00:44:16,587 --> 00:44:22,321
The girl I knew read the Bible at night
and sang in my church.

546
00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:26,427
She didn't run around with boys
and fornicate.

547
00:44:26,630 --> 00:44:29,098
She didn't lie to her father.

548
00:44:29,299 --> 00:44:31,790
I don't think she's a liar.

549
00:44:32,002 --> 00:44:34,800
It's true, Ernesto. She doesn't lie.

550
00:44:35,005 --> 00:44:38,236
A girl who hasn't been with a man
doesn't end up with a baby. Period.

551
00:45:23,353 --> 00:45:24,320
You're a loser.

552
00:45:24,521 --> 00:45:26,614
Smoking pot in the afternoon,
watching cartoons.

553
00:45:26,824 --> 00:45:30,089
Look who's talking,
14 and pregnant.

554
00:45:30,661 --> 00:45:33,630
Face it. Your life is over.

555
00:45:33,897 --> 00:45:34,921
No, it isn't.

556
00:45:35,132 --> 00:45:39,193
I'm gonna have my baby, go to school,
do everything I planned to do anyway.

557
00:45:39,403 --> 00:45:41,098
Good luck.

558
00:45:43,607 --> 00:45:46,599
- Want a hit?
- No.

559
00:45:58,088 --> 00:45:59,612
Nobody believes you, huh?

560
00:45:59,823 --> 00:46:02,257
- About what?
- About what? Come on.

561
00:46:03,794 --> 00:46:05,056
No.

562
00:46:05,262 --> 00:46:06,957
Nobody believed me
about anything.

563
00:46:07,164 --> 00:46:10,292
That's because you're a liar,
and a thief, and a pothead, and a gay.

564
00:46:10,501 --> 00:46:12,128
So?

565
00:46:18,208 --> 00:46:20,938
I read some stuff on the Internet.
Why don't you check it out?

566
00:46:21,145 --> 00:46:22,112
What stuff?

567
00:46:22,312 --> 00:46:24,837
Oh, you know. Sex advice.

568
00:46:25,048 --> 00:46:27,175
I don't need no sex advice.

569
00:46:27,384 --> 00:46:29,215
Just trying to help.

570
00:46:48,972 --> 00:46:51,406
"Is there any way to get pregnant
if the man's sperm...

571
00:46:51,608 --> 00:46:54,475
...gets onto the outside of the vagina
but not inside?

572
00:46:54,678 --> 00:46:56,703
Signed, Pregnant Virgin."

573
00:46:56,914 --> 00:46:57,938
"Dear Pregnant Virgin.

574
00:46:58,148 --> 00:46:59,740
Sperm are very determined beings...

575
00:46:59,950 --> 00:47:03,852
...whose sole reason to exist
is to get inside the fallopian tubes.

576
00:47:04,054 --> 00:47:06,420
Whenever sperm is sprayed near
the vaginal opening...

577
00:47:06,623 --> 00:47:08,784
...there is a chance
that they could swim inside."

578
00:47:08,992 --> 00:47:10,516
- See?
- Fuck.

579
00:47:10,727 --> 00:47:13,252
- You still think it's someone else's?
- I never did.

580
00:47:13,463 --> 00:47:16,955
I mean, it's just weird, that's all.

581
00:47:17,167 --> 00:47:18,964
- What are the chances?
- I don't know.

582
00:47:21,205 --> 00:47:23,230
My sperm must be
pretty strong swimmers, huh?

583
00:47:23,540 --> 00:47:24,700
Shut up.

584
00:47:24,908 --> 00:47:28,935
- I mean, I only came on your leg.
- Herman, stop.

585
00:47:30,247 --> 00:47:32,147
Did you show this to your dad?

586
00:47:33,383 --> 00:47:34,714
Why not?

587
00:47:34,918 --> 00:47:37,648
And let him know how far we did go?
Yeah, he'd love that.

588
00:47:40,657 --> 00:47:43,217
- Hey.
- What?

589
00:47:43,427 --> 00:47:45,520
If he's a boy, we can call him Jesus.

590
00:47:47,264 --> 00:47:48,253
Yeah.

591
00:47:48,465 --> 00:47:51,992
- I'm sure he'll be a great kid.
- Or she.

592
00:47:53,503 --> 00:47:56,301
We can make him a papoose
and take him traveling with us.

593
00:48:00,210 --> 00:48:01,700
Come here.

594
00:48:11,922 --> 00:48:13,617
What are you doing later?

595
00:48:13,824 --> 00:48:16,816
Nothing. Got the day off.

596
00:48:17,594 --> 00:48:19,357
Want some?

597
00:48:19,563 --> 00:48:23,795
There's no smoking in the house.
It's the rule. It's not my rule.

598
00:48:24,001 --> 00:48:25,263
Okay.

599
00:48:27,905 --> 00:48:30,100
How long you guys been together?

600
00:48:30,474 --> 00:48:35,138
About five years now,
with six months off for good behavior.

601
00:48:35,345 --> 00:48:36,607
You guys split up?

602
00:48:36,813 --> 00:48:41,841
Yeah, about two years ago.
Then got back together again.

603
00:48:43,453 --> 00:48:45,182
You guys cool?

604
00:48:46,356 --> 00:48:49,951
I don't know.
It's like we're so different.

605
00:48:50,594 --> 00:48:52,152
I'm spontaneous...

606
00:48:52,362 --> 00:48:55,388
...and he likes to plan things
two months in advance, you know?

607
00:48:55,832 --> 00:49:00,769
He's so dependent. Must be
the age difference or something.

608
00:49:01,939 --> 00:49:03,907
He's older than you?

609
00:49:04,107 --> 00:49:09,101
Yeah, like six years older than me.
You ass.

610
00:49:12,649 --> 00:49:14,310
I gotta go.

611
00:49:16,086 --> 00:49:18,384
I shouldn't be talking about
age difference with you.

612
00:49:18,588 --> 00:49:20,488
I'm like nine years older
or something?

613
00:49:20,724 --> 00:49:22,316
Ten.

614
00:49:24,328 --> 00:49:26,421
I don't really think about it, though.

615
00:49:26,863 --> 00:49:28,490
Neither do I.

616
00:49:45,882 --> 00:49:47,645
All right.

617
00:49:51,321 --> 00:49:52,811
Hold on, hold on.

618
00:49:53,790 --> 00:49:55,223
Hello?

619
00:49:55,425 --> 00:49:57,393
- It went out.
- It's a dud.

620
00:49:57,594 --> 00:50:02,088
- Hey, come back! It's lit.
- Come back, come back.

621
00:50:02,299 --> 00:50:04,290
Cinco de Mayo!

622
00:50:04,801 --> 00:50:07,065
Cinco de Mayo.

623
00:50:11,241 --> 00:50:13,141
Yo, I'll be right back.

624
00:50:15,612 --> 00:50:17,512
Let me show you something.

625
00:50:20,550 --> 00:50:22,040
Who do you think they are?

626
00:50:22,252 --> 00:50:23,219
I don't know.

627
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:26,712
- That's your mother and Aunt Silvia.
- No way.

628
00:50:26,923 --> 00:50:29,983
It was taken out here in the yard,
when I just moved in.

629
00:50:30,193 --> 00:50:32,024
There was nothing here
but burnt grass.

630
00:50:32,229 --> 00:50:33,992
That's crazy.

631
00:50:36,233 --> 00:50:38,224
- Who's that?
- That was my mother.

632
00:50:38,435 --> 00:50:40,494
Your great-great-grandmother.

633
00:50:40,737 --> 00:50:41,829
She's beautiful.

634
00:50:42,072 --> 00:50:45,906
Dolores Angulo.
She had 22 children.

635
00:50:46,109 --> 00:50:49,909
- He was the 13th.
- Yup. My lucky number.

636
00:50:50,113 --> 00:50:52,445
Let me show you
some of my brothers.

637
00:50:55,252 --> 00:51:01,714
That's Chuy, and Alberto,
and Paco and...

638
00:51:02,392 --> 00:51:05,418
I forgot his name.
Oh, God, what's his name?

639
00:51:05,629 --> 00:51:07,358
Jorge!

640
00:51:08,765 --> 00:51:10,096
Sorry about that, Jorge.

641
00:51:10,300 --> 00:51:12,359
- And that's you?
- Yes.

642
00:51:12,569 --> 00:51:14,127
Why is your leg in a cast?

643
00:51:14,337 --> 00:51:16,396
He was in a cast for two years.

644
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:20,038
He laid down behind a truck
and tried to off himself.

645
00:51:20,243 --> 00:51:21,904
- Carlos.
- It's true.

646
00:51:22,345 --> 00:51:24,609
- It's true.
- Really?

647
00:51:24,815 --> 00:51:25,907
Yeah.

648
00:51:26,950 --> 00:51:32,217
When I was 9 years old, I decided
I didn't want any more of this life.

649
00:51:32,923 --> 00:51:35,414
I wanted to come back
as someone else.

650
00:51:35,792 --> 00:51:39,888
So I hide behind
the back wheels of a truck...

651
00:51:40,197 --> 00:51:41,562
...and waited for it to start.

652
00:51:41,765 --> 00:51:44,063
- It ran you over?
- It did.

653
00:51:44,267 --> 00:51:46,098
I wasn't supposed to live.

654
00:51:46,303 --> 00:51:49,864
I spent months and months
in the hospital.

655
00:51:50,540 --> 00:51:56,137
And it was a long time before
I could see or eat or walk.

656
00:51:57,147 --> 00:51:59,775
In a way, I got what I wanted.

657
00:52:00,550 --> 00:52:04,350
I came back as a different person
after all that.

658
00:52:05,055 --> 00:52:07,455
Don't you ever try it, though.

659
00:52:24,407 --> 00:52:26,637
- Got a date?
- Yeah, right.

660
00:52:26,843 --> 00:52:29,744
- Who with?
- None of your business, hood rat.

661
00:52:31,715 --> 00:52:33,876
What do you do
with those guys anyway?

662
00:52:35,085 --> 00:52:36,814
You embarrassed or something?

663
00:52:37,020 --> 00:52:39,989
- No.
- So?

664
00:52:41,191 --> 00:52:42,419
What do you think we do?

665
00:52:42,826 --> 00:52:44,521
I don't know.
I'm a virgin, remember?

666
00:52:44,728 --> 00:52:45,786
Yeah, right.

667
00:52:45,996 --> 00:52:48,487
Come on, Carlos. I told you stuff.

668
00:52:49,232 --> 00:52:51,097
We mess around, all right?

669
00:52:51,301 --> 00:52:53,326
Are you the peanut butter
in the sandwich?

670
00:52:53,537 --> 00:52:54,504
Fuck you.

671
00:52:55,038 --> 00:52:57,529
- Do you like both of them the same?
- No.

672
00:52:57,874 --> 00:53:00,172
- The young one's better looking.
- Yeah. Gary.

673
00:53:01,545 --> 00:53:04,139
- What do you mean?
- Nothing.

674
00:53:06,116 --> 00:53:07,811
Have you done
that kind of thing a lot?

675
00:53:08,018 --> 00:53:09,178
First time.

676
00:53:09,452 --> 00:53:12,649
- First time with two?
- No, first time ever.

677
00:53:12,856 --> 00:53:16,314
Yeah? I thought Uncle Walter
caught you with some boy?

678
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:20,018
What? Is that what Eileen told you?

679
00:53:20,697 --> 00:53:23,359
He tracked this site
I used to go to on the Internet.

680
00:53:23,567 --> 00:53:27,503
- What?
- Yeah. Fucked up, huh?

681
00:53:56,166 --> 00:53:58,794
- You're getting big.
- You mean fat.

682
00:53:59,002 --> 00:54:00,333
Come on. Don't be like that.

683
00:54:00,537 --> 00:54:03,404
- You don't like it, do you?
- Of course I do.

684
00:54:03,607 --> 00:54:06,201
- What are you up to this weekend?
- Not much. You?

685
00:54:06,643 --> 00:54:09,043
It's kind of crazy.
Saturday, I got my AP History exam.

686
00:54:09,246 --> 00:54:12,909
Saturday night's my mom's birthday.
I'm taking her out to dinner.

687
00:54:13,116 --> 00:54:14,413
Have you told her yet?

688
00:54:14,618 --> 00:54:18,054
No. I keep waiting for the right time.

689
00:54:18,588 --> 00:54:20,920
I want to tell her after her birthday.

690
00:54:21,925 --> 00:54:23,688
Well, I gotta get going.

691
00:54:30,767 --> 00:54:32,098
Hey.

692
00:54:33,136 --> 00:54:35,604
We're having a barbecue
over at my house on Sunday.

693
00:54:35,872 --> 00:54:40,400
Just some friends, relatives and stuff.
You wanna come?

694
00:54:40,610 --> 00:54:42,441
Yeah. If you want me to.

695
00:54:42,646 --> 00:54:45,274
Yeah. It'll be great.

696
00:54:45,482 --> 00:54:47,006
Call me then.

697
00:55:26,856 --> 00:55:29,984
- Hey.
- Hey.

698
00:55:30,193 --> 00:55:33,890
- What's up?
- Not much. What's up with you?

699
00:55:34,097 --> 00:55:35,689
- Food looks good.
- Yeah.

700
00:55:36,666 --> 00:55:40,033
- Thanks. You want some?
- No, not yet. I'm all right, thanks.

701
00:55:40,236 --> 00:55:42,704
- We forgot the hamburger buns.
- I thought we had some.

702
00:55:42,906 --> 00:55:45,500
Just two packs. And people
are gonna start arriving soon.

703
00:55:45,709 --> 00:55:47,802
- I'll go get some.
- Okay then.

704
00:55:48,011 --> 00:55:50,411
Mom, this is Magdalena.

705
00:55:50,613 --> 00:55:52,205
Hi, it's nice to finally meet you.

706
00:55:52,415 --> 00:55:54,815
Nice to meet you.
Thank you for coming.

707
00:55:55,018 --> 00:55:56,679
Excuse me.

708
00:56:00,256 --> 00:56:03,191
- Does she know?
- Yeah.

709
00:56:03,393 --> 00:56:06,692
- Really?
- Well, sort of.

710
00:56:07,430 --> 00:56:09,421
What's that supposed to mean?

711
00:56:10,066 --> 00:56:12,660
She knows about you,
that you're pregnant.

712
00:56:13,236 --> 00:56:15,830
- And?
- What?

713
00:56:16,039 --> 00:56:18,769
- That it's yours.
- Well, that's stage two.

714
00:56:20,076 --> 00:56:21,566
Herman.

715
00:56:21,778 --> 00:56:24,269
You don't understand.
You don't know her like I do.

716
00:56:24,481 --> 00:56:28,144
She has all these dreams
and expectations of me.

717
00:56:29,719 --> 00:56:32,347
- I think I'm gonna go home.
- No, wait.

718
00:56:33,089 --> 00:56:35,114
Go to the store with me.

719
00:56:55,445 --> 00:56:59,142
- The house looks really great.
- We have a lot of work to do.

720
00:57:00,216 --> 00:57:02,411
- Well...
- You did a great job.

721
00:57:05,722 --> 00:57:08,088
This soup's amazing.
Did you make this?

722
00:57:08,291 --> 00:57:10,919
- What is it?
- Cauliflower and caraway seeds.

723
00:57:11,194 --> 00:57:13,754
- It's unbelievable.
- I have the recipe if you want it.

724
00:57:13,963 --> 00:57:16,261
There was this really cute Latin boy
at my gym today.

725
00:57:16,466 --> 00:57:19,401
I mean, oh, my God.
Totally little cholo.

726
00:57:19,602 --> 00:57:21,593
Shaved head, tattoos,
his butt was like:

727
00:57:21,805 --> 00:57:23,670
Oh, my God,
you should meet Carlos.

728
00:57:23,873 --> 00:57:27,502
Gary. Gary, tell Stephen
about Carlos.

729
00:57:27,977 --> 00:57:30,309
Carlos? He's really hot.

730
00:57:30,613 --> 00:57:33,173
Yeah, and he's 8 inches uncut.

731
00:57:35,218 --> 00:57:38,119
- Please bring him over next time.
- No, he's all ours.

732
00:57:38,321 --> 00:57:40,118
Finders keepers.

733
00:57:40,824 --> 00:57:44,157
- Will you grab the trivet? This is hot.
- All right.

734
00:57:46,329 --> 00:57:48,058
Would you like me
to make the dressing?

735
00:57:48,264 --> 00:57:51,233
No, I'll do it.
The trash is overflowing.

736
00:58:05,415 --> 00:58:06,882
Gary.

737
00:58:07,350 --> 00:58:10,217
You scared me. What's up?

738
00:58:10,420 --> 00:58:12,047
Nothing.

739
00:58:13,756 --> 00:58:16,054
For me? Thanks.

740
00:58:17,427 --> 00:58:19,520
"Lil Rob." Cool, man.

741
00:58:19,729 --> 00:58:22,254
Yeah, I was peeping your CDs, man.
Your shit blows.

742
00:58:26,769 --> 00:58:28,031
You know, I should get back.

743
00:58:28,238 --> 00:58:30,433
- His rhymes are sick.
- I know. I love Lil Rob.

744
00:58:33,776 --> 00:58:35,539
It says Elton John.

745
00:58:38,481 --> 00:58:40,472
Shit. I'll take it back.

746
00:58:40,817 --> 00:58:42,614
Carlos, wait.

747
00:58:50,059 --> 00:58:55,497
The cellular number you are trying
to reach is no longer in service.

748
00:59:02,472 --> 00:59:05,168
The cellular number
you are trying to reach...

749
00:59:13,816 --> 00:59:15,477
- Yes?
- Hello. Is Herman home?

750
00:59:15,685 --> 00:59:17,744
- No, he's not here.
- Where did he go?

751
00:59:17,954 --> 00:59:20,650
- He's out of town with relatives.
- I need to talk to him.

752
00:59:20,857 --> 00:59:24,020
Listen. Herman
is a straight-A student.

753
00:59:24,227 --> 00:59:27,424
He's going to finish school
and go to college to study medicine.

754
00:59:27,630 --> 00:59:29,598
He doesn't have time for this.

755
00:59:29,799 --> 00:59:31,426
Sorry about the state you're in...

756
00:59:31,634 --> 00:59:34,159
...but he gave me his word
he didn't do anything with you.

757
00:59:34,370 --> 00:59:37,032
Take the problem to the person
who is responsible.

758
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:40,141
- Herman is responsible.
- I have my son's word. I believe him.

759
00:59:40,343 --> 00:59:44,677
- He's lying to you.
- Please leave my son alone. Please.

760
01:00:37,934 --> 01:00:42,166
Hey, it's James.
No, Gary forgot his phone.

761
01:00:42,672 --> 01:00:46,039
Oh, it sounds fun. I'd love to,
but I have a meeting.

762
01:00:46,609 --> 01:00:50,010
I'll tell Gary you called.
Okay. Bye.

763
01:01:02,125 --> 01:01:03,092
Goddamn him.

764
01:01:13,503 --> 01:01:17,633
- All done.
- Yeah. Thanks, Tio.

765
01:01:20,576 --> 01:01:23,545
- Are you going to see your friend?
- Yeah.

766
01:01:23,746 --> 01:01:26,647
I'm glad you have a special friend.

767
01:01:32,955 --> 01:01:35,617
I get up at 7:00 in the morning
to drive an hour to work...

768
01:01:35,825 --> 01:01:38,089
...to pay the mortgage
on this $3200 fucking house.

769
01:01:38,327 --> 01:01:40,693
Meanwhile, you've had 12 hours
to fuck the neighbor.

770
01:01:40,897 --> 01:01:43,525
I'm tired of hearing you talk
about the fucking mortgage.

771
01:01:43,766 --> 01:01:45,028
We had rules about this shit.

772
01:01:45,301 --> 01:01:47,166
This is not the same as before.

773
01:01:47,403 --> 01:01:51,464
It is! Our rules were
if we have 3-ways, we're both there.

774
01:01:51,874 --> 01:01:54,775
Otherwise, if I'm at work in my office,
that's cheating.

775
01:01:55,078 --> 01:01:56,238
Let's not do this.

776
01:01:56,446 --> 01:01:59,643
Do what? You're the one who's,
like, cheating all the fucking time.

777
01:01:59,882 --> 01:02:02,851
I'm not cheating all the time. Why
do you keep accusing me of that?

778
01:02:03,086 --> 01:02:07,284
- What, are you love with him?
- No, I'm not in love with him.

779
01:02:07,590 --> 01:02:12,027
All right? He's just some kid.
I'm in love with you.

780
01:03:02,245 --> 01:03:04,372
Didn't you notice
how big she was getting...

781
01:03:04,614 --> 01:03:06,707
...when she wouldn't
get changed for basketball?

782
01:03:06,916 --> 01:03:08,611
I heard that Herman moved
to San Diego.

783
01:03:08,885 --> 01:03:10,910
Imagine having to leave town
because of her.

784
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:12,815
This could've happened
to any of us.

785
01:03:13,022 --> 01:03:14,956
I know how close
I've come with Paco.

786
01:03:15,224 --> 01:03:17,886
But at least some of us are
smart enough to take precautions.

787
01:03:18,094 --> 01:03:19,083
Hello? Birth control.

788
01:03:19,295 --> 01:03:20,853
How far have you gone with Manuel?

789
01:03:21,097 --> 01:03:24,066
At least I'm not claiming to be a virgin
when I'm carrying a baby.

790
01:03:24,267 --> 01:03:25,757
- Is that what she's saying?
- Yes.

791
01:03:25,968 --> 01:03:27,936
Hail Mary, full of grace...

792
01:03:30,606 --> 01:03:32,699
Hey, Magdalena.

793
01:03:38,080 --> 01:03:41,311
You don't want to do that.
Not unless you have to.

794
01:03:41,584 --> 01:03:43,017
What age did you leave school?

795
01:03:43,219 --> 01:03:45,483
- When I was 12.
- Well...

796
01:03:45,688 --> 01:03:49,454
That was the way it was.
We have to work for a living.

797
01:03:49,659 --> 01:03:52,685
But I hate it right now, though.
I hate school. I hate Herman.

798
01:03:52,895 --> 01:03:54,988
I hate this baby.

799
01:03:56,332 --> 01:03:59,267
Don't leave school.
You will end up as menso as me.

800
01:03:59,468 --> 01:04:00,958
You got a letter.

801
01:04:02,205 --> 01:04:04,332
- Did you remember the toilet paper?
- No.

802
01:04:04,540 --> 01:04:06,974
- I knew you wouldn't.
- Then why did you ask?

803
01:04:08,544 --> 01:04:10,307
Is it in English, Tio?

804
01:04:12,548 --> 01:04:14,778
It's from a lawyer.

805
01:04:15,451 --> 01:04:18,750
"Pursuant to your lease of the rear unit
at 1023 Waterloo Street...

806
01:04:18,988 --> 01:04:22,151
...you are hereby given
30 days notice of eviction.

807
01:04:22,358 --> 01:04:25,555
You will be expected to vacate
the premises by June 30, 2005."

808
01:04:25,761 --> 01:04:27,592
What's the matter?

809
01:04:29,565 --> 01:04:32,033
Tio, they want us to leave.

810
01:04:32,235 --> 01:04:33,668
The motherfuckers!

811
01:04:33,870 --> 01:04:37,499
They want us to leave? Why?

812
01:04:47,516 --> 01:04:48,710
Hey, puto!

813
01:04:50,386 --> 01:04:52,616
Hey, puto, come out here, man!

814
01:04:52,822 --> 01:04:53,846
Fucking evict me, bitch?

815
01:04:56,459 --> 01:05:00,520
Get the fuck out here, puto!
What, are you fucking scared now?

816
01:05:00,730 --> 01:05:05,599
Hey, puto! Get the fuck out here!
Fucking punk!

817
01:05:08,537 --> 01:05:11,563
I told him you were from Jalisco
and guess what?

818
01:05:11,874 --> 01:05:13,967
There's someone on the same floor
from there too.

819
01:05:14,210 --> 01:05:15,802
You all right with these steps?

820
01:05:16,045 --> 01:05:17,205
- It's good.
- He's fine.

821
01:05:17,446 --> 01:05:19,607
Wasn't there anything
on the ground floor?

822
01:05:19,815 --> 01:05:21,112
You heard the landlord.

823
01:05:21,317 --> 01:05:23,911
The elevator's gonna be
working again tomorrow.

824
01:05:24,120 --> 01:05:27,385
- It's not a problem. Right, Tio?
- No problem.

825
01:05:34,463 --> 01:05:37,830
It's not bad. It's not bad at all.

826
01:05:38,034 --> 01:05:40,093
Look, you have a nice big window.

827
01:05:40,303 --> 01:05:43,363
I'll fix you curtains. Buttercup yellow,
to make it more cheerful.

828
01:05:46,309 --> 01:05:47,503
Needs a new coat of paint.

829
01:05:47,743 --> 01:05:50,940
Well, you can do that for him.
It'll take you all of a day.

830
01:05:51,147 --> 01:05:54,139
Tio, we're gonna have to put some
of your stuff in storage...

831
01:05:54,350 --> 01:05:58,309
...but I think it will be good
to go through some of your things.

832
01:06:04,727 --> 01:06:08,288
I always tell my friends what a gentle
man he is, what a sweet man.

833
01:06:08,597 --> 01:06:10,792
Who knew
he could be so stubborn?

834
01:06:11,300 --> 01:06:13,632
Nothing we show him is
good enough. Nothing.

835
01:06:13,836 --> 01:06:16,304
And when you try to talk about it,
he just doesn't hear.

836
01:06:17,239 --> 01:06:19,707
He wouldn't even look at the one
Ernesto found for him.

837
01:06:19,909 --> 01:06:21,206
You see?

838
01:06:21,410 --> 01:06:24,846
But think how hard it must be.

839
01:06:25,047 --> 01:06:26,105
Twenty-eight years.

840
01:06:26,315 --> 01:06:28,909
I've never been more
than five years in one home.

841
01:06:29,118 --> 01:06:32,679
That's you. You always
want something bigger.

842
01:06:32,888 --> 01:06:37,348
I don't know how he's going
to sort through everything.

843
01:06:37,560 --> 01:06:39,960
And then there are the dogs.

844
01:06:40,162 --> 01:06:42,494
And Carlos, and Magdalena.

845
01:07:36,585 --> 01:07:38,018
Hey.

846
01:07:40,890 --> 01:07:41,879
You cold?

847
01:07:42,191 --> 01:07:44,853
- No.
- Then what?

848
01:07:45,061 --> 01:07:47,689
None of my clothes
fit me anymore.

849
01:07:50,533 --> 01:07:52,626
Can't you get your folks
to give you some money?

850
01:07:52,835 --> 01:07:54,200
No.

851
01:07:55,638 --> 01:07:59,165
- Lf you told them what happened...
- Why should that be so important?

852
01:07:59,375 --> 01:08:01,343
So they could hold their heads up
in church?

853
01:08:01,544 --> 01:08:05,412
So I can be a good girl again?
It's so stupid.

854
01:08:07,016 --> 01:08:08,779
I've got a shirt.

855
01:08:08,984 --> 01:08:13,546
- I don't want your smelly shirts.
- It's extra large. It's brand new.

856
01:08:42,184 --> 01:08:45,153
HOUSE FOR RENT
2 BEDROOMS-BACKHOUSE NICE!

857
01:08:45,888 --> 01:08:50,120
We re-did all the ceilings,
got rid of the cottage cheese.

858
01:08:50,326 --> 01:08:51,725
Floors are refinished.

859
01:08:51,927 --> 01:08:54,987
The appliances are new.
Cupboards are new.

860
01:08:55,197 --> 01:08:59,065
And that's Travertine tile.
My partner put it in herself.

861
01:08:59,268 --> 01:09:00,895
It's beautiful.

862
01:09:01,504 --> 01:09:03,472
And you say it's just you
and your uncle.

863
01:09:03,672 --> 01:09:06,232
- No, there are three of us.
- It might be cramped for three.

864
01:09:06,475 --> 01:09:08,136
It's fine. Do you take pets?

865
01:09:08,444 --> 01:09:11,641
If it's nice fellas like those guys,
no problem.

866
01:09:12,114 --> 01:09:13,547
Great.

867
01:09:14,583 --> 01:09:16,050
It's $ 1600 a month.

868
01:09:18,087 --> 01:09:19,213
Wow.

869
01:09:19,421 --> 01:09:23,016
Sorry, but we've put
a lot of money into it.

870
01:09:23,225 --> 01:09:25,125
That's what I figured.

871
01:09:31,433 --> 01:09:34,630
- You're not gonna make champurrado?
- Not today.

872
01:09:42,511 --> 01:09:44,103
Wait till later. I'll help you out.

873
01:09:44,313 --> 01:09:45,871
No, don't worry.

874
01:09:47,216 --> 01:09:49,548
Okay. See you later.

875
01:10:00,396 --> 01:10:03,695
Yeah, so he came, hit me,
did a hit and run...

876
01:10:03,899 --> 01:10:05,628
...damaged this part, dented this.

877
01:10:05,834 --> 01:10:08,860
I have to replace this and this.
I don't know how I'm gonna do it.

878
01:10:09,205 --> 01:10:11,935
Don't even worry about it.
I got a guy who'll take care of it.

879
01:10:12,408 --> 01:10:15,434
- Carlos, go do the Mustang.
- It's gonna be hard to take care of.

880
01:10:15,644 --> 01:10:17,942
- Let me show you what we got.
- Okay.

881
01:10:22,251 --> 01:10:24,219
It was just what we needed.

882
01:10:24,420 --> 01:10:27,446
Yeah, we just laid around,
went shopping a little.

883
01:10:27,656 --> 01:10:29,021
No, I love Palm Springs too.

884
01:10:41,770 --> 01:10:45,137
It's better now. Gary seems happier.
He's starting a new job.

885
01:10:45,341 --> 01:10:47,639
Yeah, he just...
He had too much time on his hands.

886
01:10:52,381 --> 01:10:55,646
What the fuck
are you doing, Carlos?

887
01:10:56,552 --> 01:10:58,486
Get him.

888
01:11:08,964 --> 01:11:11,831
Hey. What happened?

889
01:11:12,034 --> 01:11:14,764
- Did you get into another fight?
- Yeah.

890
01:11:14,970 --> 01:11:16,562
I'll get some iodine.

891
01:11:16,772 --> 01:11:18,763
Here. Sit down.
I'll put some ice on it.

892
01:11:30,085 --> 01:11:32,110
You idiot.

893
01:11:32,621 --> 01:11:35,454
- I lost my job.
- Great.

894
01:11:35,658 --> 01:11:39,287
I needed to get out of there, anyway.
Shitty job.

895
01:11:39,495 --> 01:11:42,589
- I thought it was your chosen career.
- Shut up.

896
01:11:43,399 --> 01:11:46,926
I'm getting a real job in TV as a PA.

897
01:11:47,136 --> 01:11:48,160
With your boyfriend?

898
01:11:48,370 --> 01:11:50,361
- Fuck you.
- Hold still.

899
01:11:54,777 --> 01:11:58,110
I'm gonna have to make more money
if we're gonna get a new place.

900
01:12:01,417 --> 01:12:05,717
I've been thinking.
Herman's not coming back.

901
01:12:07,189 --> 01:12:09,714
Someone's gotta take care of that kid
and be a father to him.

902
01:12:09,925 --> 01:12:11,324
Might as well be me.

903
01:12:13,195 --> 01:12:14,753
I'm gonna get a real job.

904
01:12:15,764 --> 01:12:18,528
One that's not
a total fucking dead-end.

905
01:12:20,869 --> 01:12:24,430
And you can stay in school,
and Tio Tomas can baby sit.

906
01:12:24,640 --> 01:12:27,575
- Yeah, right.
- I'm serious.

907
01:12:41,156 --> 01:12:43,624
Yes, I'm calling about
the apartment.

908
01:12:44,793 --> 01:12:47,626
Oh, that's too bad.
Yes. All right, thanks.

909
01:12:59,074 --> 01:13:02,635
I know. I know. It's unbelievable.
Hold on. Hold on.

910
01:13:02,845 --> 01:13:04,642
I called about the apartment.

911
01:13:04,847 --> 01:13:06,542
Sorry, it's just been rented.

912
01:13:09,084 --> 01:13:11,678
- How old are you?
- Almost 15.

913
01:13:11,887 --> 01:13:14,651
- And how old is your uncle?
- Eighty-five.

914
01:13:14,857 --> 01:13:17,451
I don't think
it's gonna work out, chica.

915
01:13:20,896 --> 01:13:24,263
The front unit's already been taken,
but there's a place in the back.

916
01:13:24,466 --> 01:13:26,525
I can let you have it for 400.

917
01:13:38,580 --> 01:13:41,674
Look. I gotta think
about the dollars and cents here.

918
01:13:41,884 --> 01:13:45,115
I have applications from qualified
professionals who want to rent it.

919
01:13:45,320 --> 01:13:47,413
The whole neighborhood
is the same.

920
01:13:47,623 --> 01:13:51,320
Everyone who moves in
is, well, white.

921
01:13:53,061 --> 01:13:54,392
Does he work, your uncle?

922
01:13:54,997 --> 01:13:57,056
Not really. He sells champurrado.

923
01:13:57,266 --> 01:14:01,327
That little guy with the clown's horn?
My God, is he still around?

924
01:14:01,537 --> 01:14:03,698
Yeah, he's doing great.

925
01:14:03,906 --> 01:14:07,239
He gave me free champurrado once.
I don't believe this.

926
01:14:11,613 --> 01:14:15,845
Apart from a great sense of continuity
with the past, what else is there?

927
01:14:16,051 --> 01:14:18,076
- You mean money?
- Yeah.

928
01:14:18,287 --> 01:14:21,723
The stuff that doesn't grow on trees,
makes the world go around.

929
01:14:21,924 --> 01:14:23,949
Well, Carlos is unemployed
right now...

930
01:14:24,159 --> 01:14:28,152
...but he's angling for a job in TV
that pays really, really well.

931
01:14:28,363 --> 01:14:31,890
But look, if he does your gardening,
that saves you a $ 100 a month.

932
01:14:32,100 --> 01:14:35,228
I can clean your house. That'll
save you another $ 100 a month.

933
01:14:55,757 --> 01:14:57,884
Carlos.

934
01:15:39,167 --> 01:15:41,032
What's going on?

935
01:15:41,236 --> 01:15:44,467
- It's Tio Tomas.
- What?

936
01:15:44,673 --> 01:15:47,608
He passed. Peacefully.

937
01:15:48,944 --> 01:15:51,003
They took him away.

938
01:17:02,651 --> 01:17:06,382
Look. The tangerine tree.

939
01:17:06,688 --> 01:17:08,656
Remember how sweet
the juice was?

940
01:17:08,890 --> 01:17:11,654
I cried when they had
to chop it down.

941
01:17:15,097 --> 01:17:17,327
Is that Aunt Lucia there?

942
01:17:17,966 --> 01:17:20,434
Yeah. But who's
that woman with her?

943
01:17:20,636 --> 01:17:22,433
I don't know.

944
01:17:25,374 --> 01:17:28,138
He had a long, happy life,
and in the end he didn't suffer.

945
01:17:28,343 --> 01:17:30,504
It's the way he would have wanted it.

946
01:17:31,480 --> 01:17:36,349
- He didn't want to move from here.
- No, he didn't.

947
01:17:43,725 --> 01:17:47,422
Look at you. You're showing.

948
01:17:49,831 --> 01:17:54,200
Non-penetrative conception
is a very unusual thing.

949
01:17:54,903 --> 01:17:57,098
I've read about it,
but never encountered it...

950
01:17:57,305 --> 01:18:00,138
...and I've been on staff here
for eight years.

951
01:18:00,642 --> 01:18:03,042
But in her case,
the evidence is there.

952
01:18:03,245 --> 01:18:05,475
There's no reason why
the birth shouldn't be...

953
01:18:05,681 --> 01:18:07,615
...as trouble-free as
a normal conception.

954
01:18:08,483 --> 01:18:11,452
It may be necessary
to physically break the hymen...

955
01:18:11,653 --> 01:18:13,814
...closer to the actual
delivery date.

956
01:18:14,022 --> 01:18:16,991
But that should be
a painless procedure.

957
01:18:18,093 --> 01:18:19,890
You understand?

958
01:18:24,700 --> 01:18:26,361
It's kind of neat what the guy did...

959
01:18:26,568 --> 01:18:30,004
...but put a hot tub over here and
landscaping and it'll look awesome.

960
01:18:36,178 --> 01:18:38,146
What do we do with this?

961
01:18:48,890 --> 01:18:51,324
This morning,
a button came off my suit.

962
01:18:51,526 --> 01:18:54,654
Could you sew it on for me
before the funeral?

963
01:18:58,200 --> 01:19:00,134
Are you listening to me?

964
01:19:04,239 --> 01:19:05,866
What's wrong with you?

965
01:19:11,113 --> 01:19:13,172
Magdalena was telling the truth.

966
01:19:13,381 --> 01:19:14,541
You saw Magdalena?

967
01:19:16,618 --> 01:19:19,178
Today at Tomas'.

968
01:19:19,721 --> 01:19:24,556
We went to the clinic together.
The doctor examined her and it's true.

969
01:19:24,760 --> 01:19:26,751
She's never been with a boy.

970
01:19:26,962 --> 01:19:28,395
What?

971
01:19:29,464 --> 01:19:31,455
It's a miracle.

972
01:19:55,857 --> 01:19:59,816
Tomas Alvarez was a good man.

973
01:20:01,129 --> 01:20:05,691
A man who embodied
the Lord's commandments.

974
01:20:05,901 --> 01:20:11,430
Especially the commandment
to love thy neighbor.

975
01:20:13,241 --> 01:20:15,004
We can be sure
that in this moment...

976
01:20:15,977 --> 01:20:20,243
...Tomas has gone to a better place.

977
01:20:22,017 --> 01:20:23,541
Amen.

978
01:20:25,987 --> 01:20:28,285
Before concluding our service...

979
01:20:28,657 --> 01:20:34,118
...Carlos, the nephew of Tomas,
would like to say a few words.

980
01:20:55,083 --> 01:21:01,420
Tomas Alvarez was born in Jalisco,
Mexico in 1921.

981
01:21:02,023 --> 01:21:04,958
The 13th kid out of 22.

982
01:21:05,660 --> 01:21:08,288
When he was born,
he was so small...

983
01:21:08,496 --> 01:21:11,590
...the midwife said
he wasn't worth washing.

984
01:21:12,400 --> 01:21:13,958
He ended up outliving all of them.

985
01:21:15,537 --> 01:21:19,496
In his life, he was an office boy...

986
01:21:20,742 --> 01:21:24,473
...a barber, and a farm worker.

987
01:21:25,280 --> 01:21:28,408
Then in America,
he sold champurrado.

988
01:21:28,617 --> 01:21:30,551
Everybody knew him.

989
01:21:31,253 --> 01:21:32,811
If you walk down the street...

990
01:21:33,021 --> 01:21:35,512
...he would stop every
two minutes to talk to someone.

991
01:21:37,359 --> 01:21:39,725
They were always happy to see him.

992
01:21:44,065 --> 01:21:47,296
He had a love inside him
that was so strong.

993
01:21:49,237 --> 01:21:52,604
It came from his heart and out through
his eyes like a golden light.

994
01:21:55,410 --> 01:21:57,503
Everybody could see it...

995
01:21:58,580 --> 01:22:02,277
...because he loved everyone
and judged no one.

996
01:22:05,253 --> 01:22:10,589
At the end of my life, I will count it
as my greatest privilege...

997
01:22:11,559 --> 01:22:13,527
...that I knew a saint.

998
01:22:15,730 --> 01:22:18,665
Because Tomas Alvarez
was a saint.

999
01:22:21,937 --> 01:22:27,273
And he will not leave us.
His spirit is still strong.

1000
01:22:29,444 --> 01:22:31,309
He'll be with us
till the end of our days.

1001
01:23:03,478 --> 01:23:07,812
Your mother tells me
this is some kind of a miracle.

1002
01:23:09,384 --> 01:23:12,353
There's a scientific explanation.

1003
01:23:13,488 --> 01:23:16,582
The Lord works in mysterious ways.

1004
01:23:16,925 --> 01:23:19,052
This wasn't his doing.

1005
01:23:19,260 --> 01:23:22,491
Everything is his doing.

1006
01:23:37,612 --> 01:23:39,671
Will you forgive me?

1007
01:23:49,224 --> 01:23:51,590
I'll make it up to you.

1008
01:23:54,763 --> 01:23:56,663
I promise.

1009
01:30:40,763 --> 01:30:42,663
