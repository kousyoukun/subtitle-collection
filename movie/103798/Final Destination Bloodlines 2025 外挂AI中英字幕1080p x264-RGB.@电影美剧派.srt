虹膜

我知道你不喜欢谈论她

嘿，孩子们，来吃午饭吧

可能只是压力太大了
It's probably just stressed 

340
00:26:38,050 --> 00:26:39,760
你应该试试褪黑素
You should try melatonin 

341
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:40,280
好吧
Okay 

342

但奇怪的是
But , but the weird thing is 

343
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:45,360
我一直梦想着50年前的一个真实的地方
I've been dreaming about a real place from from fifty years ago 

344
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,940
就像一家叫天景的餐厅
It was like a restaurant called the sky view 

345
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:54,200
你知道，这是真的，我刚刚告诉你了吗

也许也许如果我能跟她谈谈

种马在梦想奶奶的月经补助金
Stud is dreaming about grandmas cycle grant 

350
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,060
我以为她死了
I thought she was dead 

351
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:05,990
对我们来说她已经死了
Well , she was dead to us 

352
00:27:05,990 --> 00:27:10,750
草原爱尔兰骆驼是一个非常不安的女人和一个故事
Steppe irish camel is a very deeply disturbed woman and a story 

353
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:11,810
如果我能跟她谈谈
If i could just talk to her 

354
00:27:11,810 --> 00:27:14,450
然后也许也许我想如果这些梦是不符合标准的
Then then maybe maybe i think if these dreams are off step 

355
00:27:14,450 --> 00:27:15,450
放下它吧
Just drop it 

356
00:27:15,450 --> 00:27:16,130
我不明白

到底发生了什么，这么糟糕的事
What , what happened that was so bad for one thing

她就是你妈妈搞砸一切的原因

怎么啦？听着，我只是不想再谈这个了

阿来史蒂夫

00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:31,000
我们的父亲去世后

虹膜断裂了
Iris just snapped 

365

她她不让我们去上学
She she wouldn't let us go to school 

366
00:27:36,710 --> 00:27:38,690
她把我们锁在屋子里
She locked us inside the house 

367
00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:42,670
她痴迷于所有可怕的死法
She obsessed about all the horrific ways we could die 

368
00:27:42,670 --> 00:27:44,830
最后情况变得很糟糕

我的意思是太糟糕了
I mean so bad 

370
00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:47,850
国家来了

它把我和你妈妈从她身边带走了
And it took your mother and i away from her 

372
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:52,100
但事情并没有就此结束

她开始发这个

满是讣告的可怕信件

还有这些令人不安的尸体照片
And these disturbing pictures of dead bodies 

378
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:06,495
我们不得不搬家，这样她就不能再联系我们了
We had to move so she couldn't contact us anymore 

379
00:28:06,495 --> 00:28:08,760

00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:21,010
那晚我救了很多人的命
I saved a lot of lives that night 

477
00:36:21,010 --> 00:36:24,470
那些本不该被拯救的生命
Lives that were never meant to be saved 

478
00:36:24,470 --> 00:36:27,395
之后他们就关门了
They close the restaurant after that 

479
00:36:27,395 --> 00:36:31,687
所以它需要额外的翻新
So it needed additional renovations 

480
00:36:31,687 --> 00:36:33,790
但它从未重新开放
But it never reopened 

481
00:36:33,790 --> 00:36:35,670
最后他们把它拆掉了
Eventually they tore it down 

482
00:36:35,670 --> 00:36:38,870
所以你你阻止了这场灾难
But so you you stop the disaster 

483
00:36:38,870 --> 00:36:40,190
是
Yes 

484
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:47,060
死神不喜欢你破坏他的计划
The death doesn't like it when you fuck with his plans 

485
00:36:47,060 --> 00:36:49,100
这么多年过去了，他又回来了
So over the years he came bac

486
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:51,560
他杀了那晚在场的所有人
And he killed everyone who was there that night 

487
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:53,580
包括我的保罗
Including my paul 

488
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:57,140
等等，等一下，对不起
Wait , wait a minute , i'm sorry 

489
00:36:57,140 --> 00:36:57,720
你是
Did you 

490
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:59,680
你是说死神回来了
Did you say death came back 

491
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:02,110
他是个无情的混蛋
He's a relentless son of a bitch 

492
00:37:02,110 --> 00:37:04,230
不完成任务他是不会罢休的
Won't stop till he finishes the job 

493
00:37:04,230 --> 00:37:06,890
但我教会了自己如何预见他的到来
But i taught myself how to see him comin

494
00:37:06,890 --> 00:37:09,750
预测他的一举一动
To anticipate his every move 

495
00:37:09,750 --> 00:37:13,535
我已经把他关了好几年了
Been keeping him a bay for years now 

496
00:37:13,535 --> 00:37:16,250
现在他害我得了癌症
And now he's got me cancer 

497
00:37:16,250 --> 00:37:18,770
哦，相信那狗屁
Oh , uh , believe that shit 

498
00:37:18,770 --> 00:37:19,670
对不起
Sorry 

499
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:21,910
两个月前得到了诊断
Got the diagnosis two months ago 

500
00:37:21,910 --> 00:37:24,500
等等那是那是我开始做梦的时候
Wait that's that's when i started having my dream 

501
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:26,000
看，这是个征兆
See it's a sign 

502
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,220
好的，但是为什么呢？
Okay , but why 

503
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:29,060
为什么我会梦到你所看到的
Why am i dreaming about what you saw 

504
00:37:29,060 --> 00:37:31,140
也许我的癌症已经过了我的末期
Maybe my cancer passed my permination 

505
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:32,800
你不是吗？也许这就是命运
Aren't you ? maybe it's fate 

506
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,160
疯狂的幽默感
Demented sense of humor 

507
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:35,120
谁知道呢
Who the hell knows 

508
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:40,380
重要的是，当宇宙说话时，你要注意
What matters is that when the universe speaks you pay attention 

509
00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:54,100
我看到你了，你他妈的
i see you you fuck 

510
00:37:58,620 --> 00:37:59,980
嗯
Um 

511
00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:02,980
你在跟谁说话啊
Who who are you talking to death 

512
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:06,325
他以为我因为你在这里而分心了
He thinks i'm distracted because you're here 

513
00:38:06,325 --> 00:38:08,910
我得把这本书里的东西都教给你
I have to teach you everything in this boo

514
00:38:08,910 --> 00:38:11,720
这需要一些时间来学习基本知识
That will take some time to learn the basics 

515
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:13,060
所以你得待在这里
So you need to stay here 

516
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:13,700
呆在这里
Stay here 

517
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:15,280
外面的世界太危险了
Outside world is too dangerous 

518
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:17,240
我有二十年没去过那里了
I haven't stepped out there in twenty years 

519
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:18,120
在一年内

00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:19,900
我们会很安全
We can be safe 

521

But you know . i'll . i'll come back and i'll visit . no , i'm sick

我活不了那么久了
I won't be alive that long 

530
00:38:38,780 --> 00:38:44,850
你不能走，难道你没看到死亡正在向我们家走来吗
You can't leave don't you see death is coming for our family 

531
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:49,060
你不相信我
You don't believe me

不，我是我我想我想我犯了个错误

我想，我想那可能只是个梦

Oh julia

00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:55,880
哦,酷
Oh cool 

633
00:45:55,880 --> 00:45:57,530
你已经准备好了
Are you already 

634
00:45:57,530 --> 00:46:02,220
天啊，里面有只虫子。哦,我
Oh my god , there's a bug in there . oh i 

635
00:46:26,060 --> 00:46:29,560
哦，你懂的，我不认为你懂
Oh you got it i don't think you got it 

636
00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:30,860
哦，它是随附的
oh it's coming with 

637
00:46:34,260 --> 00:46:36,540
事实上，我正在把关爱变成一份工作
Actually i'm turning love caring jo

638
00:46:36,540 --> 00:46:40,700
太好了，查理

639
00:46:58,660 --> 00:47:04,060
哈哈哈，妈妈，女孩们准备好了

00:47:20,660 --> 00:47:24,820
如果我和你一起看呢

641
00:47:25,990 --> 00:47:27,570
哇
Wow 

642
00:47:27,570 --> 00:47:29,370
开始吧
Here we go 

643
00:47:29,370 --> 00:47:31,955
你在这里布置得很好
It's great to setup you've got here 

644
00:47:31,955 --> 00:47:35,610
我希望孩子们有一个快乐的童年
Well i wanted the kids to have a happy childhood 

645
00:47:35,610 --> 00:47:37,040
不像我认识的一些人
Unlike some people i know 

646
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:39,240
哈哈哈，你不是在说这个吧
Ha ha ha you're not talking about that 

647
00:47:39,240 --> 00:47:41,700
所以，哦不，我们有一个美好的童年
So yeah , oh no , we had a great childhood 

648
00:47:41,700 --> 00:47:43,820
你看着我。我发现
you look at me . i turned out 

649
00:47:54,110 --> 00:47:55,670
霍华德
howard 

650
00:47:55,670 --> 00:47:57,250
好吧，那是什么
Well , on what is that 

651
00:47:57,250 --> 00:47:59,970
但它看起来像一个室内提示
But it looks like a house cue 

652
00:47:59,970 --> 00:48:02,250
别这样，我们还有空房间
Come on , you know , we got the spare room 

653
00:48:02,250 --> 00:48:05,510
总比在拖车公园里跳来跳去好
and it's gotta be better than bounce around trailer parks 

654
00:48:12,580 --> 00:48:14,500
我觉得这不是个好主意
I don't think this is a good idea 

655
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:16,980
第二次机会永远不会太迟
it's never too late for a second chance 

656
00:48:20,100 --> 00:48:21,900
我很抱歉
i'm sorry 

657
00:48:24,900 --> 00:48:27,060
没有我他们过得更好
they better off without me 

658
00:48:30,060 --> 00:48:31,360
接电话接电话
Pick up pick u

659
00:48:31,360 --> 00:48:38,340
来吧，回到我身边，我
come on you back to me i 

660
00:48:49,140 --> 00:48:52,420
嘿，爸爸给她看回程
Hey dad shows her back fligh

661
00:48:52,420 --> 00:48:56,300
不，不，不，明天是我的霍华德
no no no yeah tomorrow blower it's my howard 

662
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:28,570
哦，接得好，接得好
Oh nice catch and de okay 

663
00:49:28,570 --> 00:49:29,610
好了，开始吧

664
00:49:29,610 --> 00:49:30,910
好吧，爸爸让你做了
Okay dad let you do it 

665
00:49:30,910 --> 00:49:31,910
也要远离那一天
stay away from that day as well 

666
00:49:31,910 --> 00:49:34,410
在你走之前我还有一个小时
i got hour before you go just like co 

667
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:14,080
我很高兴你决定来
i'm glad you decided to come 

668
00:50:16,700 --> 00:50:19,140
全家人都来了
Got the whole family here 

669
00:50:21,080 --> 00:50:24,120
哦，嗬，嗬，嗬，耶，好
Oh ho ho ho yeah oka

670
00:50:24,120 --> 00:50:25,120
所有对吗
All righ

671
00:50:25,120 --> 00:50:27,642
哦好
oh good 

672
00:50:27,642 --> 00:50:30,490
啊啊啊啊
Ah oh a

673
00:50:30,490 --> 00:50:32,570
我很好，是0
I'm ok it's o

674
00:50:32,570 --> 00:50:36,030
对不起，哇，哇，哇
hsorry wow wow wo 

675
00:50:47,660 --> 00:50:50,040
以前的事都过去了
The former things are passed away 

676
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:53,380
既不会有清晨，也不会有痛苦
Neither shall there be morning nor pain 

677
00:50:53,380 --> 00:50:54,960
他要擦去
And he shall wipe awa

678
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:57,365
他们眼中的每一滴眼泪
Every tear from their eyes 

679
00:50:57,365 --> 00:50:59,920
死亡将不复存在
And death shall be no more 

680
00:51:55,180 --> 00:51:57,260
这些都是什么
what is all this stuff 

681
00:52:02,680 --> 00:52:06,640
我在爱尔兰的书里找到了这些文件
I found these papers in irish's book 

682
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:10,460
它们是给人民的讣告和文章
they are obituaries and and articles for the people 

683
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:15,112
是谁在那天晚上看到了天空，虹膜有了预感
Who were at the sky view on the night that iris had a premonition 

684
00:52:15,112 --> 00:52:19,690
这些人都以奇怪而混乱的方式死去了
Each one of these people went on to die in in some weird and messed up way 

685
00:52:19,690 --> 00:52:24,210
不仅如此，他们的死亡顺序和虹膜的预感一致
And and not only that , they all died in the same orders as iris is premonition 

686
00:52:24,210 --> 00:52:26,970
数百人本该在那晚死去
Hundreds of people were supposed to die that night 

687
00:52:26,970 --> 00:52:30,192
但我阻止了这场灾难
But i was i was stopped the disaster 

688
00:52:30,192 --> 00:52:34,170
于是死神一个接一个地回来了
So death came back for them one by one 

689
00:52:34,170 --> 00:52:36,280
因为有这么多幸存者
Since there were so many survivors 

690
00:52:36,280 --> 00:52:39,040
过了很多年，死亡才降临到他们身上
It took years for death to get to all of them 

691
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:41,420
但最终它变成了虹膜
But eventually it got to iris 

692
00:52:42,440 --> 00:52:45,020
在预感中，她是最后一个死去的
She was last to die in the premonition 

693
00:52:45,020 --> 00:52:48,582
是她和一个小男孩
it was her and and a little boy it 

694
00:52:48,582 --> 00:52:51,187
但她准备好了
But she was prepared 

695
00:52:51,187 --> 00:52:55,540
她凭一己之力抵挡了几十年的死亡
She single handedly held off death for for decades 

696
00:52:55,540 --> 00:52:57,585
叶德娴亲爱的
Deanie sweetie 

697
00:52:57,585 --> 00:53:00,460
我觉得现在对我们来说不太合适
I don't think this is the appropriate time with us 

698
00:53:00,460 --> 00:53:00,840
是的
Yeah 

699
00:53:00,840 --> 00:53:03,430
我的意思是这些都和这个没有任何关系，对吧
I mean none of this even has anything to do with this , right 

700
00:53:03,430 --> 00:53:06,290
为什么是我们？不，就是这样它和这件事有很大关系
Why are we ? no , that's it that it has everything to do with this 

701
00:53:06,290 --> 00:53:07,110
我的意思是
I mean bi

702
00:53:07,110 --> 00:53:10,160
因为死亡需要很长时间才能穿过幸存者
Because death took so long to make its way through the survivors 

703
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:11,900
这些人后来都有了家庭
These people went on to have families 

704
00:53:11,900 --> 00:53:14,467
他们本不该拥有的家庭
Families that they never should have had 

705
00:53:14,467 --> 00:53:17,030
所以死亡也带走了他们
So death took them too 

706
00:53:17,030 --> 00:53:18,470
噢,是的
Oh yeah 

707
00:53:18,470 --> 00:53:19,170
是的
Yeah 

708
00:53:19,170 --> 00:53:22,390
难道你看不出死亡正在向你袭来吗
Don't you see this death is coming for u

709
00:53:22,390 --> 00:53:24,880
因为我们不应该存在
Because we were never supposed to exist 

710
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:29,990
好吧，为什么这个房间里的每个人都在听那首歌呢
Ok , so why everybody in this room is on that's hitless bobby 

711
00:53:29,990 --> 00:53:31,490
住手，她是这么说的
Stop that's what she said 

712
00:53:31,490 --> 00:53:33,790
不，不，爸爸和阿姆布伦达很安全
No , no , dad and ambrenda are saf

713
00:53:33,790 --> 00:53:35,690
因为他们不是我的血脉
Because they're not part of ire's bloodline 

714
00:53:35,690 --> 00:53:36,660
好吧
Okay 

715
00:53:36,660 --> 00:53:38,680
遵循以下模式
Following the pattern 

716
00:53:38,680 --> 00:53:42,130
随着年龄的增长，死亡沿着每根树枝向下延伸
Death makes its way down each branch by age 

717
00:53:42,130 --> 00:53:44,330
因为霍华德叔叔是老大
So because uncle howard was the oldest 

718
00:53:44,330 --> 00:53:46,580
首先从他的家人开始，也就是埃里克
It'll start with his family first meaning eric 

719
00:53:46,580 --> 00:53:48,290
下一个是你，去死吧
You're next go fuck yourself 

720
00:53:48,290 --> 00:53:50,010
然后它会去找茱莉亚
Then it'll go for julia 

721
00:53:50,010 --> 00:53:51,757
然后鲍比
Then bobby 

722
00:53:51,757 --> 00:53:54,880
然后它会来我们的分支，从tharene开始
Then it will come for our branch , starting with tharene 

723
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:56,370
然后我
Then me 

724
00:53:56,370 --> 00:53:58,312
然后查尔梅
Then charme 

725
00:53:58,312 --> 00:54:00,470
查理
Charlie 

726
00:54:00,470 --> 00:54:02,817
你相信吗？
You buying this 

727
00:54:02,817 --> 00:54:04,520
哦,不
Oh no 

728
00:54:04,520 --> 00:54:06,290
这太棒了
This is so master 

729
00:54:06,290 --> 00:54:10,020
我是说你把我们爸爸的死变成了某种该死的阴谋论
I mean you're turning our dad's death into some kind of fucked up conspiracy theory 

730
00:54:10,020 --> 00:54:11,920
什么是生的，不，不，不，不，不，不
What is raw with no , no , no , no , no , no 

731
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:14,340
这不是这也不是阴谋
It's not it's not a conspiracy too 

732
00:54:14,340 --> 00:54:15,840
我们都要下水了
And that we're all gonna dip 

733
00:54:15,840 --> 00:54:18,960
停!我一分钟都听不下去了
Stop ! i can't listen to this for one more minute 

734
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:24,180
那个疯女人的胡言乱语已经给这个家庭带来了足够的痛苦
That crazy woman's nonsense has cause enough pain suffering for this family 

735
00:54:24,180 --> 00:54:27,290
Pm和renda，请不要打扰我
Pm and renda , please leave me alone 

736
00:54:27,290 --> 00:54:27,630
好吧
Okay 

737
00:54:27,630 --> 00:54:31,450
在艾弗的书里，她提到了一个逃过死亡的人
In in iver's book she mentioned somebody who cheated deaths and survived 

738
00:54:31,450 --> 00:54:32,440
一步。
Step 

739
00:54:32,440 --> 00:54:34,210
来吧。埃里克，不，等等
Come on . eric , no , wait 

740
00:54:34,210 --> 00:54:35,730
我很担心你
I'm worried about you
