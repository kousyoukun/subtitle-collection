你被捕了。
You're under arrest.

27
00:01:25,169 --> 00:01:26,753
跪下。
Get on your knees.

28
00:01:26,837 --> 00:01:28,964
我什么也没做。
I didn't do anything.

00:01:29,047 --> 00:01:31,091
手!手!手!
Hands! Hands! Hands!

00:01:31,175 --> 00:01:34,678
威廉，我知道我让你把衣服拿出去洗。
William, I know I told you to take out the laundry.

31
00:01:43,145 --> 00:01:45,480
-比利，你去哪? -洗衣店。
- Billy, where you going? - Laundry.

32
00:01:45,564 --> 00:01:47,858
-你能帮我吗? -不。
- Oh, can you do mine? - No.

我希望谢尔曼能抓住你。
I hope Sherman gets you.

如果你看到他，告诉我们。
If you see him, let us know.

35
00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:09,086
我们不需要他再吓唬孩子了，好吗?
We don't need him scaring any more kids, all right?

36
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:34,112
这就是内幕。他们是孩子。
And that's the lowdown. Them kids.

37
00:02:34,196 --> 00:02:35,864
他们还在找他。
They're still looking for him.

38
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:40,369
天黑以后不要出去。你知道吗?
Just don't get out after dark. You know?

39
00:02:40,452 --> 00:02:41,703
我就是这么说的。
That's what I said.

40
00:04:24,932 --> 00:04:28,352
从大楼里传来可疑的声音。我们去看看。
Suspicious noise from inside the building. We're gonna check it out.

-你紧张吗? -什么?
- You nervous? - What?

43
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:45,614
你在用瓶子做那件事，用你的手。
You're doing that thing with the bottle, with your hands.

44
00:06:45,697 --> 00:06:48,158
-你是不是有点坐立不安? -不。不。
- Are you a little fidgety? - No. No.

45
00:06:48,242 --> 00:06:49,785
-是的。-你紧张吗?
- Yeah. - Are you nervous?

46
00:06:49,868 --> 00:06:52,579
不，我想和你姐姐成为最好的朋友。
No, I want to become best friends with your sister.

看到了吗?你会怎么想?
See? How would you feel about that?

48
00:06:56,124 --> 00:06:57,626
-我很好。 -嗯哼。
- I'm fine. - Uh-huh.

49
00:07:03,632 --> 00:07:05,592
嗯哼。嗯哼。
Uh-uh. Uh-uh.

50
00:07:06,927 --> 00:07:10,430
这是什么酒?沃尔格林?罗斯柴尔德的?
What is this wine? Walgreens? Rothschild's?

51
00:07:10,514 --> 00:07:12,766
冰箱里有烤肉，如果你喜欢的话。
We have a moscato in the fridge, if that's more your taste.

52
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:15,811
我想邮递员送酒。
I think Postmates delivers wine.

53
00:07:15,894 --> 00:07:17,521
这是你的吗?
Is this one of yours?

54
00:07:17,604 --> 00:07:19,940
是的。非常古老。
Yes. Very old piece.

55
00:07:20,023 --> 00:07:22,234
他讨厌我把这个放在上面。
He hates that I put that up there.

56
00:07:22,317 --> 00:07:26,405
-有时候，你得向前看。-但你没有，对吧，
- At some point, you gotta move on. - Except that you haven't though, right,

57
00:07:26,488 --> 00:07:29,157
两年内完成了一件作品?
made a piece in, what, two years?

58
00:07:29,241 --> 00:07:32,452
只是你是我的缪斯女神，我很少见到你，特洛伊。
It's just that you're my muse, and I don't see you often enough, Troy.

59
00:07:32,536 --> 00:07:34,121
唔唔。唔唔。
Mm-mmm. Mm-mmm.

60
00:07:34,204 --> 00:07:36,290
-我的天，别说了。你太过分了。 -嗯?
- Oh, my gosh, stop. You are too much. - Hmm?

61
00:07:36,373 --> 00:07:37,499
-谢谢。-小坏蛋。
- Thank you. - Brat.

62
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:38,625
-让它呼吸。 -闭嘴。
- Let it breathe. - Shut up.

63
00:07:38,709 --> 00:07:40,961
他还是有趣的，我们没有让他做我们的房地产经纪人。
He's still salty we didn't use him as our realtor.

64
00:07:41,044 --> 00:07:42,087
-你也看得出来。 -嗯哼。
- As you can tell. - Mm-hmm.

65
00:07:42,171 --> 00:07:44,965
-可怕。你怎么受得了? -不，不，不，亲爱的
- Horrible. How can you stand that? - No, no, no, sweetie.

66
00:07:45,048 --> 00:07:46,884
你根本不了解芝加哥的房地产。
You don't know the first thing about Chicago real estate.

67
00:07:46,967 --> 00:07:48,218
他一定喜欢你，
He must like you,

68
00:07:48,302 --> 00:07:50,596
因为他真的露出了他的屁股。
because he's really showing his ass.

69
00:07:50,679 --> 00:07:53,307
-他不是一直都这样吗? -你给的太多了，布里。
- Isn't he always? - You overpaid, Bri.

70
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:55,475
不仅仅是里面有价值。
It's not just the inside that counts.

71
00:07:55,559 --> 00:07:57,644
-离画廊很近。-是的，非常实用。
- It's close to the gallery. - Yeah, it's very practical.

72
00:07:57,728 --> 00:07:59,771
-好吧，有什么问题吗? -没什么。
- Okay, what is wrong with it? - Nothing.

73
00:07:59,855 --> 00:08:01,356
我跟我妹妹说过很多次，
As I told my sister many times,

74
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,942
-这附近闹鬼。-到处闹鬼。
- the neighborhood is haunted. - Everywhere is haunted.

75
00:08:04,026 --> 00:08:06,069
-特洛伊，别这么说。-当然，当然，当然，
- Troy, do not start with that. - Sure, sure, sure,

76
00:08:06,153 --> 00:08:08,447
但为什么要选择一个曾经被称为烟熏谷的地方呢?
but why choose a place that used to be called Smokey Hollow?

77
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:11,450
那么，小地狱，那是什么?战斗的小巷?
Then, Little Hell, then what is it? Combat Alley?

78
00:08:11,533 --> 00:08:13,785
-现在叫什么来着? -卡布里尼格林。
- What's it called now? - Cabrini-Green.

79
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:15,913
正是那些项目。
It was the projects.

80
00:08:15,996 --> 00:08:18,540
经济适用房的名声尤其不好。
It was affordable housing that had a particularly bad reputation.

81
00:08:18,624 --> 00:08:21,001
-你永远不会知道。-因为他们把它拆掉了
- You would never know. - Because they tore it down

82
00:08:21,084 --> 00:08:22,628
并把它改造得很好。
and gentrified the shit out of it.

83
00:08:22,711 --> 00:08:26,673
换句话说：白人建立了贫民窟，然后又将其抹去
Translation: White people built the ghetto and then erased it

84
00:08:26,757 --> 00:08:28,675
当他们意识到他们建造了贫民区。
when they realized they built the ghetto.

85
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:30,761
-哦，无意冒犯。 -没人介意。
- Oh, no offense. - None taken.

86
00:08:30,844 --> 00:08:33,304
他们利用这个机会使它适于居住。
They took the opportunity to make it livable.

87
00:08:33,388 --> 00:08:34,972
我可以给你找个更好的。
I could've got you a better conversion.

88
00:08:35,057 --> 00:08:37,100
他们一直告诉人们，他们会做得更好，
They kept telling people they were gonna make it better,

89
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:40,895
把他们从一个地方搬到另一个地方，但他们只是把它拆掉，
moving 'em from place to place, but they were just tearing it down,

90
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:42,773
所以他们可以开发周围的一切。
so they could develop everything around it.

91
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:44,358
哦，就像这里。
Oh, like here.

92
00:08:49,112 --> 00:08:50,572
你们想听个恐怖故事吗?
You guys want to hear a scary story?

93
00:08:52,407 --> 00:08:53,992
-不。 -太糟糕了。
- No. - Too bad.

94
00:08:58,372 --> 00:09:00,707
但我投了反对票。
But I voted no.

95
00:09:00,791 --> 00:09:01,959
-特洛伊……-啊噢。
- Troy… - Uh-oh.

96
00:09:03,168 --> 00:09:04,503
哦,我的天啊。
Oh, my gosh.

97
00:09:05,671 --> 00:09:06,880
真的吗?
Really?

98
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:20,978
这玩意最好是好的。
This shit better be good.

99
00:09:23,647 --> 00:09:25,649
这是一个故事
This is a story

100
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:27,776
一个叫海伦·莱尔的女人
about a woman named Helen Lyle.

101
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:30,821
她是个研究生，一个白人研究生，
She was a grad student, a white grad student,

102
00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:33,615
她在写关于卡布里尼-格林的城市传说的论文。
doing her thesis on the urban legends of Cabrini-Green.

103
00:09:35,158 --> 00:09:38,704
为了研究，她来过几次卡布里尼?
For research, she came down to Cabrini a few times, you know?

104
00:09:38,787 --> 00:09:43,000
问问题，拍涂鸦，给人拍照。
Asking questions, taking pictures of graffiti, of people.

105
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:44,168
然后,
And then,

106
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:46,253
有一天,
one day,

107
00:09:47,087 --> 00:09:48,380
她就……
she just…

108
00:09:49,423 --> 00:09:50,841
……啪。
…snaps.

109
00:09:52,426 --> 00:09:54,511
她砍了一只罗特韦尔犬的头。
She beheaded a Rottweiler.

110
00:09:54,595 --> 00:09:56,096
当警察出现的时候，
By the time the police show up,

111
00:09:56,180 --> 00:10:00,309
她在一间公寓里，在血泊中做雪天使。
she's in one of the apartments, doing snow angels in a pool of blood.

112
00:10:00,392 --> 00:10:01,643
-唔。 -扯淡。
- Ew. - Bullshit.

113
00:10:02,269 --> 00:10:03,270
-特洛伊。 -扯淡。
- Troy. - Bullshit.

114
00:10:03,353 --> 00:10:05,272
-你从哪儿弄来的? -她杀了一只罗特韦尔犬?
- Where do you get this? - She killed a Rottweiler?

115
00:10:05,355 --> 00:10:06,982
这是额外的，即使对你。
This is extra, even for you.

116
00:10:07,065 --> 00:10:08,317
有很多关于这方面的文章。
There are articles written about this.

117
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,818
查一下。
Look it up.

118
00:10:09,902 --> 00:10:11,945
当局逮捕了她
The authorities take her in,

119
00:10:12,029 --> 00:10:13,614
但她几乎立刻就逃了出来。
but she escapes almost immediately.

120
00:10:14,448 --> 00:10:17,075
她暴跳如雷
She goes on a rampage,

121
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:20,412
在她身后留下了一串尸体，
leaving a trail of bodies in her wake and then,

122
00:10:20,495 --> 00:10:22,539
其中一个居民的孩子…
the baby of one of the residents…

123
00:10:22,623 --> 00:10:23,707
…被绑架。
…is abducted.

124
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:27,461
母亲悲痛欲绝。每个人都在找他，
The mother is devastated. Everyone is looking for him,

125
00:10:27,544 --> 00:10:29,254
一无所获。
and nothing.

126
00:10:29,796 --> 00:10:32,549
在一年一度的篝火晚会上，
On the night of the annual bonfire,

127
00:10:32,633 --> 00:10:35,052
所有卡布里尼的居民都在观看…
with all of the residents of Cabrini watching…

128
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:37,471
海伦来了……
…Helen arrives…

129
00:10:38,305 --> 00:10:40,557
带着祭品。
with a sacrificial offering.

130
00:10:42,851 --> 00:10:45,145
她抱着孩子，奔向火堆，
Baby in her arms, she runs towards the fire,

131
00:10:45,229 --> 00:10:46,647
但他们已经盯上她了，很快。
but they're on her, quick.

132
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:50,400
他们说她当时处于神游状态，盲目反抗。
They say she was in a fugue state, fighting back blindly.

133
00:10:50,484 --> 00:10:52,402
但他们把孩子送走了。
But they got the baby free.

134
00:10:52,486 --> 00:10:54,905
当大家都在为他操心的时候，
While everyone is fussing over him,

135
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:56,740
海伦站起来,
Helen stands up,

136
00:10:57,950 --> 00:11:00,369
径直走进火里。
and walks right into the fire.

137
00:11:01,245 --> 00:11:03,455
她就是在那个地方死的，
And it's on that spot that she dies,

138
00:11:03,539 --> 00:11:08,335
被烧死，就在卡布里尼草地中央。
burns to death, right in the middle of Cabrini-Green.

139
00:11:11,046 --> 00:11:13,340
我的玫瑰红葡萄酒还在冰箱里吗?
Is my rosé still in the freezer?

140
00:11:14,925 --> 00:11:16,593
你不想要莫斯卡托吗?
You don't want the moscato?

141
00:11:18,428 --> 00:11:20,264
莫斯卡托是餐后甜酒。
Moscato's a dessert wine.

142
00:11:22,599 --> 00:11:24,518
-再见,布里-布里。 -爱你。
- Bye, Bri-Bri. - Love you.

143
00:11:24,601 --> 00:11:26,353
-很高兴见到你。-还有，安东尼，快去画画!
- Nice to meet you. - And, Anthony, get painting!

144
00:11:26,436 --> 00:11:28,647
我妹妹下半辈子可不想供养你。
My sister's not trying to support you the rest of her life.

145
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:30,649
放下重物，拿起刷子。
Put down those weights, pick up them brushes.

146
00:11:30,732 --> 00:11:31,942
-特洛伊…… -别这样。
- Troy… - Come on.

147
00:11:32,901 --> 00:11:34,403
他很有趣。
He's funny.

148
00:11:34,486 --> 00:11:37,281
他很可笑。
He is ridiculous.

149
00:11:37,364 --> 00:11:38,532
他是对的。
He is right.

150
00:11:45,122 --> 00:11:48,584
我很高兴特洛伊终于和正常人约会了。
I'm just glad Troy's finally dating someone normal.

151
00:11:48,667 --> 00:11:54,298
为了跟上那些欧洲时装设计师的步伐，我累坏了。
I was getting exhausted trying to keep up with all those European fashion designers.

152
00:11:54,923 --> 00:11:56,216
喂?
Hello?

153
00:11:57,384 --> 00:12:00,053
克莱夫明天什么时候来?
What time is Clive coming tomorrow?

154
00:12:00,137 --> 00:12:01,471
上午10点。
10:00 a.m.

155
00:12:02,472 --> 00:12:04,766
你对自己的表演感觉不错吗?
You feeling good about what you're showing?

156
00:12:05,684 --> 00:12:07,603
呃，我想是的。
Uh, I think so.

157
00:12:08,353 --> 00:12:09,521
嗯…
Uh…

158
00:12:09,605 --> 00:12:11,190
一些他可能会喜欢的东西。
Some stuff he might enjoy.

159
00:12:11,273 --> 00:12:13,400
嗯哼。
Mm-hmm.

160
00:12:13,483 --> 00:12:15,569
好吧,好吧。
Okay, okay.

161
00:12:17,112 --> 00:12:18,197
嗯。
Huh.

162
00:12:19,114 --> 00:12:21,700
我想她确实杀了一只罗特韦尔犬。
I guess she did kill a Rottweiler.

163
00:12:21,783 --> 00:12:22,910
该死的。
Damn.

164
00:12:23,619 --> 00:12:25,037
我不在乎
I don't care.

165
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:28,624
我不想在睡觉前在我的新公寓里被吓到。
I'm not trying to get creeped out in my new apartment before bed.

166
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:32,419
你的新公寓是防鬼的。
Your new apartment is ghost-proof.

167
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:35,839
-在链家目录上有。-我们的新公寓。
- It was on the Zillow listing. - Our new apartment.

168
00:12:35,923 --> 00:12:37,216
嗯哼。
Mm-hmm.

169
00:12:37,299 --> 00:12:38,383
对不起。
Sorry.

170
00:12:41,094 --> 00:12:43,055
过来。
Come here.

171
00:12:48,227 --> 00:12:49,645
嗯。
Hmm.

172
00:12:49,728 --> 00:12:51,355
你是谁，伙计?
Who are you, man?

173
00:12:53,357 --> 00:12:54,691
嗯,嗯…
Uh, well…

174
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:57,945
这是两年前的安东尼·麦考伊。
This is Anthony McCoy of two years ago.

175
00:12:58,028 --> 00:13:00,739
我想要未来的安东尼·麦考伊。
I want the Anthony McCoy of the future.

176
00:13:00,822 --> 00:13:04,201
我想要明天芝加哥艺术界的黑人大希望。
I want the great Black hope of the Chicago art scene of tomorrow.

177
00:13:04,284 --> 00:13:08,080
我研究生毕业后就给他办了个展。
That's the guy that I gave a solo show to straight out of grad school.

178
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:11,792
听着，我真的不想经历这一切
Look, I really don't want to have to go through

179
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:13,836
暑期秀顶替你的麻烦，
the trouble of replacing you in the summer show,

180
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:17,798
但你是唯一一个没给我看我画的东西的人!
but you're the only person who hasn't shown me what I'm putting up!

181
00:13:19,967 --> 00:13:23,262
-我在忙些事。-好好研究你的历史吧，伙计!
- I'm working on something. - Dig into that history of yours, dude!

182
00:13:23,345 --> 00:13:25,848
我在考虑做些项目方面的事情。
I'm thinking about doing something about the projects.

183
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:29,768
-还有白人至上主义……-白人。
- And about how white supremacy… - White people.

184
00:13:29,852 --> 00:13:32,563
是的，它是如何创造这些空间的
Yeah, how it creates these spaces

185
00:13:32,646 --> 00:13:34,606
对有色人种社区的严重忽视，
of rampant neglect for communities of color,

186
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:36,733
-特别是黑人社区。-对，比如你来自哪里。
- in particular, Black communities. - Yeah, like where you're from.

187
00:13:36,817 --> 00:13:39,945
-是的。布朗兹维尔。-南区有点被耍了。
- Yeah. Bronzeville. - South Side is kind of played.

188
00:13:41,488 --> 00:13:43,866
呃,或者卡布里尼-格林。
Uh, or Cabrini-Green.

189
00:13:47,202 --> 00:13:49,162
-我饿了。 -我也是。
- I'm hungry. - Me too.

190
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:51,540
再见,宝贝。
Bye, babe.

191
00:13:51,623 --> 00:13:53,542
-别忘了我们今晚有你妈妈的。- 7点。
- Don't forget we have your mom's tonight. - 7:00.

192
00:13:57,504 --> 00:13:58,505
再见。
Bye.

193
00:17:23,961 --> 00:17:26,839
他们以前几乎从来没有来过这里。
They'd almost never come round here back in the day.

194
00:17:28,006 --> 00:17:29,758
除非是为了抓人。
Unless it was to take someone in.

195
00:17:30,551 --> 00:17:32,636
但那是很久以前的事了。
But that was a long time ago.

196
00:17:33,428 --> 00:17:35,764
现在他们似乎也离不开了。
Now they can't seem to stay away.

197
00:17:35,848 --> 00:17:38,684
晚上，他们在我们最后一个人还住的地方站岗，
At night, they post up where the last of us still live,

198
00:17:38,767 --> 00:17:41,520
街区两边都有一辆警车。
a police car on either side of the block.

199
00:17:41,603 --> 00:17:43,230
维护我们的安全……
Keeping us safe…

200
00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:46,149
或者把我们关在里面。
or keeping us in.

201
00:17:47,442 --> 00:17:49,361
你在这附近住了一段时间了?
You've lived around here for a while?

202
00:17:50,362 --> 00:17:53,073
从高楼倒塌之前就开始了。
Uh, since before the high-rises came down.

203
00:17:53,156 --> 00:17:55,158
威廉。威廉·伯克。
William. William Burke.

204
00:17:55,242 --> 00:17:56,535
安东尼·麦考伊。
Anthony McCoy.

205
00:17:59,788 --> 00:18:00,789
需要帮忙吗?
You need a hand?

206
00:18:02,833 --> 00:18:04,251
甜蜜之家。
Home sweet home.

207
00:18:06,086 --> 00:18:09,464
啊，变化越多，保持不变的就越多。
Ah, the more things change, the more things stay the same.

208
00:18:09,548 --> 00:18:11,049
你好吗，兄弟?
How you doing, brother?

209
00:18:11,133 --> 00:18:14,803
问问这里的白人关于“女孩X”的事，丹特尔·戴维斯。
Ask the white people around here about "Girl X," Dantrell Davis.

210
00:18:14,887 --> 00:18:16,013
只有白眼。
Blank stares.

211
00:18:16,096 --> 00:18:19,725
一个白人妇女死在兜帽区，这个故事将永远流传下去。
One white woman dies in the hood, and the story lives on forever.

212
00:18:19,808 --> 00:18:21,518
我想这是个好故事。
It's a good story, I guess.

213
00:18:21,602 --> 00:18:23,687
你介意我做些笔记吗?
You mind if I take some notes?

214
00:18:27,816 --> 00:18:31,111
让你不禁想到，是什么让一个人如此暴跳如雷。
Makes you think about what could make someone just snap like that.

215
00:18:31,195 --> 00:18:33,947
海伦·莱尔是来找糖果人的。
Helen Lyle was out here looking for Candyman.

216
00:18:34,031 --> 00:18:36,533
要我说，她找到他了。
You ask me, I say she found him.

217
00:18:38,619 --> 00:18:39,953
糖果人是什么?
What's Candyman?

218
00:18:42,122 --> 00:18:45,876
对我来说，糖果人是一个叫谢尔曼·菲尔兹的人。
For me, Candyman was a guy named Sherman Fields.

219
00:18:45,959 --> 00:18:48,337
他拿了个钩子当手。
He had a hook for a hand.

220
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:49,421
邻域特征。
Neighborhood character.

221
00:18:49,505 --> 00:18:52,508
我小时候经常站在那儿发糖果。
Used to stand there and hand out sweets when I was a kid.

222
00:18:53,592 --> 00:18:54,593
一年十月，
One October,

223
00:18:55,302 --> 00:18:58,847
一个剃须刀片出现在一个白人小女孩的万圣节糖果里。
a razor blade shows up in a little white girl's Halloween candy.

224
00:18:58,931 --> 00:19:02,017
警察来找谢尔曼，但谢尔曼不见了。
Police come around looking for Sherman, but Sherman's gone.

225
00:19:03,435 --> 00:19:07,231
有一天，我亲眼看到了他。
And one day, I saw him myself.

226
00:19:17,866 --> 00:19:19,451
他一直躲在墙里。
He'd been hiding in the walls.

227
00:19:26,667 --> 00:19:28,377
我们听到了可疑的声音……
We got a suspicious noise…

228
00:19:29,461 --> 00:19:31,922
那时我看到了恐惧的真实面目。
That's when I saw the true face of fear.

229
00:19:34,341 --> 00:19:36,760
快点！快点。走，走，走！
Come on, come on. Go, go, go!

230
00:19:36,844 --> 00:19:38,470
走，走！快点，我们走!
Go, go! Come on, let's go!

231
00:20:01,702 --> 00:20:03,370
快点!快，快，快，快!
Hurry! Come on, go, go, go!

232
00:20:18,010 --> 00:20:19,011
在这儿呢。
Over here.

233
00:20:19,094 --> 00:20:21,555
滚出去!快点!
Get out of here! Come on!

234
00:20:27,811 --> 00:20:29,229
他们蜂拥而至。
They swarmed him.

235
00:20:36,153 --> 00:20:38,238
当场杀了他。
Killed him right there on the spot.

236
00:20:48,874 --> 00:20:50,959
几周后出现了什么?
What shows up a couple weeks later?

237
00:20:52,211 --> 00:20:54,755
更多的刀片在更多的糖果里。
More razor blades in more candy.

238
00:20:56,298 --> 00:20:59,551
那时我们才知道谢尔曼是无辜的。
That's when we knew Sherman had been innocent.

239
00:20:59,635 --> 00:21:01,053
无害的。
Harmless.

240
00:21:02,763 --> 00:21:04,806
但那不是我们最后一次见到他。
But that wasn't the last we saw of him.

241
00:21:58,819 --> 00:22:00,487
我不知道该怎么跟你说。
I don't know what to tell you.

242
00:22:00,571 --> 00:22:02,447
贝肖退出了我的节目。
Beshaw dropped out of my show.

243
00:22:03,657 --> 00:22:07,119
我几个月前就告诉你把她送去戒毒所了。
Oh, I told you months ago to put her in rehab.

244
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:09,705
你解决这个问题。
You fix this.

245
00:22:16,378 --> 00:22:17,504
呃。
Uh.

246
00:22:19,798 --> 00:22:20,799
啊哈。
Uh-huh.

247
00:22:21,341 --> 00:22:22,509
啊哈。好吧。
Uh-huh. Okay.

248
00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:26,054
有什么事吗?
What's up?

249
00:22:27,055 --> 00:22:30,267
-你忘了你妈妈的。 -该死。对不起。
- You forgot your mother's. - Shit. I'm sorry.

250
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:32,269
请你给那个女人打电话好吗?
Will you please call that woman?

251
00:22:32,352 --> 00:22:34,354
-明天。-你昨天也这么说。
- Tomorrow. - You said that yesterday.

252
00:22:34,438 --> 00:22:36,356
她想和你在一起，这很好。
And it's nice that she wants to spend time with you.

253
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:37,816
不是每个人都有。
Not everyone has that.

254
00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:40,861
她还好吗？
Is she okay?

255
00:22:40,944 --> 00:22:44,198
她暗示我给你钱，免得你去看她。
She implied that I give you money so you won't visit her.

256
00:22:45,365 --> 00:22:47,618
所以，她和我差不多。
So, she's about the same.

257
00:22:47,701 --> 00:22:49,828
-别说了。 -太好了。
- Stop it. - That's great.

258
00:22:49,912 --> 00:22:51,330
我想给你看样东西。
I wanna show you something.

259
00:22:52,122 --> 00:22:53,332
嗯…
Uh…

260
00:22:54,249 --> 00:22:57,002
-我要上楼吗? -呆在那儿别动。
- Do I need to come upstairs? - Stay right there.

261
00:22:57,085 --> 00:22:59,046
那好吧。
All righty then.

262
00:22:59,129 --> 00:23:03,342
谢尔曼的脸被打得面目全非，
Sherman's face was beaten so badly that it was unrecognizable,

263
00:23:03,425 --> 00:23:06,011
这就是故事的开始。
and that's where the story started.

264
00:23:06,094 --> 00:23:09,014
他们看到他在卡布里尼附近。
About them seeing him around Cabrini.

265
00:23:09,097 --> 00:23:10,933
他要来接你
About him coming to get you.

266
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:16,772
随着时间的推移，他的名字消失了，他变成了糖果人。
Over time, his name disappears, and he just becomes the Candyman.

267
00:23:18,232 --> 00:23:19,483
你觉得呢?
What do you think?

268
00:23:19,566 --> 00:23:21,109
嗯…
Well…

269
00:23:21,193 --> 00:23:22,945
这是一种非常字面的方法。
it's a pretty literal approach.

270
00:23:23,779 --> 00:23:26,198
没有多少观众的解读空间。
Not much room for viewer interpretation, you know.

271
00:23:26,281 --> 00:23:30,035
从暴力的象征主义转向对暴力的实际描绘。
Moving from the symbolism of violence to the actual depiction of it.

272
00:23:30,118 --> 00:23:32,996
好吧，但你感觉如何?
Okay, but how is it hitting you?

273
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:34,498
很……
It's…

274
00:23:35,415 --> 00:23:36,917
痛苦。
painful.

275
00:23:37,584 --> 00:23:41,046
我觉得我和这个很有共鸣。我从来没这么清楚过。
I feel really connected to this. I've never been this clear before.

276
00:23:42,464 --> 00:23:45,676
就好像我很清楚自己现在该做什么。
It's like I know exactly what I'm meant to be doing right now.

277
00:23:46,927 --> 00:23:50,013
宝贝，太好了。
Babe, that's great.

278
00:23:52,099 --> 00:23:55,894
-我相信克莱夫会……-哦，还有一件事
- And I'm sure Clive will be... - Oh, there's one more thing.

279
00:23:56,728 --> 00:24:00,107
传说是如果你说他的名字五次
The legend is if you say his name five times

280
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:01,650
在照镜子的时候，
while looking in the mirror,

281
00:24:02,359 --> 00:24:05,571
他出现在镜子里，然后杀了你。
he appears in the reflection and kills you.

282
00:24:06,822 --> 00:24:09,449
所以,我认为
So, I thought

283
00:24:09,533 --> 00:24:11,827
我们可以……
that we could…

284
00:24:11,910 --> 00:24:13,412
你觉得怎么样?
What did you think?

285
00:24:13,495 --> 00:24:15,289
召唤他。
Summon him.

286
00:24:16,874 --> 00:24:18,166
他妈的不。
Hell no.

287
00:24:19,418 --> 00:24:20,794
不。
No.

288
00:24:20,878 --> 00:24:22,337
糖果人。
Candyman.

289
00:24:22,421 --> 00:24:23,672
安东尼……
Anthony…

290
00:24:23,755 --> 00:24:26,508
-糖果人。-安东尼,不。
- Candyman. - Anthony, no.

291
00:24:26,592 --> 00:24:28,760
-糖果人。 -停。别说了。
- Candyman. - Stop. Stop it.

292
00:24:28,844 --> 00:24:30,387
-糖果人。 -别说了!
- Candyman. - Stop it!

293
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:31,597
好吧。
Okay.

294
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:34,057
-你最好不要做最后一个。-好的，好的，好的。
- You better not do that last one. - Okay, okay, okay.

295
00:24:37,019 --> 00:24:40,147
-糖果人。-安东尼，你玩得太多了!
- Candyman. - Anthony, you play too much!

296
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:41,565
住手，住手，住手。
Stop, stop, stop.

297
00:24:41,648 --> 00:24:43,442
你的手怎么了?
What happened to your hand?

298
00:24:43,525 --> 00:24:45,777
-该死的蜂蜇。 -真的吗?
- Fucking bee sting. - Really?

299
00:24:45,861 --> 00:24:47,279
是啊，真他妈疼。
Yeah, that shit hurt.

300
00:24:47,362 --> 00:24:49,615
嗯。看起来像它。
Mmm. Looks like it.

301
00:24:49,698 --> 00:24:51,867
-吻它。-给我滚出去。
- Kiss it. - Get the fuck outta here.

302
00:24:52,743 --> 00:24:54,453
救命，救命。
Help, help.

303
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:32,176
-我们可以走了。 -终于。
- We can go now. - Finally.

304
00:26:34,303 --> 00:26:38,307
去年，我们和詹姆森在弗雷兹洛杉矶弗里兹做了一个单人展位。
Last year, we did a solo booth at Frieze LA with Jameson.

305
00:26:38,390 --> 00:26:39,725
非凡的工作。
Phenomenal work.

306
00:26:39,808 --> 00:26:41,018
这些都是相关的作品，
These are related works,

307
00:26:41,101 --> 00:26:46,231
但在这里，他重新制作并循环播放档案片段。
but here, he's recreating and looping archival footage.

308
00:26:47,858 --> 00:26:49,443
慢慢来。
Just take your time.

309
00:26:58,368 --> 00:27:00,746
这与你以前的工作有很大的不同。
This is quite a departure from your previous work.

310
00:27:02,915 --> 00:27:04,166
来吧，打开它。
Go ahead, open it.

311
00:27:12,299 --> 00:27:16,470
我试着将这些存在于同一地点的时刻排列起来。
I'm trying to align these moments in time that exist in the same place.

312
00:27:17,513 --> 00:27:19,223
这个想法几乎
The idea is to almost

313
00:27:19,306 --> 00:27:23,769
把悲剧调整成专注于当下的血统。
calibrate tragedy into a focused lineage that culminates in the now.

314
00:27:24,770 --> 00:27:28,106
布里安娜，告诉你儿子别霸占评论家。
Brianna, tell your boy not to hog the critic.

315
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:31,944
他有一大堆东西。
He's got a whole thing.

316
00:27:32,027 --> 00:27:36,573
是啊，不，我知道，我听到了。它很复杂。
Yeah, no, I know, I heard it. It's complicated.

317
00:27:36,657 --> 00:27:40,410
她在和作品互动。
She's interacting with the piece.

318
00:27:40,494 --> 00:27:43,914
镜子邀请你尝试召唤自己。
The mirror invites you to attempt the summoning yourself.

319
00:27:45,582 --> 00:27:46,583
嗯。
Huh.

320
00:27:48,961 --> 00:27:51,713
总之，我不知道我为什么站在我自己的棋子旁边
Anyway, I don't know why I'm standing next to my own piece

321
00:27:51,797 --> 00:27:53,674
像个混蛋一样。
like some kind of asshole.

322
00:27:53,757 --> 00:27:57,928
-工作本身就说明了一切。-哦，它说话了，好吧。
- The work speaks for itself. - Oh, it speaks, all right.

323
00:27:58,971 --> 00:28:01,431
它用说教式的、下意识的陈词滥调
It speaks in didactic knee-jerk clichés

324
00:28:01,515 --> 00:28:04,852
讲述了高档化周期中的暴力环境。
about the ambient violence of the gentrification cycle.

325
00:28:05,561 --> 00:28:09,731
但你们这类人才是真正的先驱者。
But your kind are the real pioneers of that cycle, you know.

326
00:28:09,815 --> 00:28:11,149
不好意思？
Excuse me?

327
00:28:12,401 --> 00:28:13,527
艺术家。
Artists.

328
00:28:15,445 --> 00:28:18,323
艺术家们纷纷来到被剥夺权利的街区，
Artists descend upon disenfranchised neighborhoods

329
00:28:18,407 --> 00:28:21,201
寻找便宜的租金，这样他们就可以在工作室里闲逛，
divining cheap rent, so they can dick around in their studios

330
00:28:21,285 --> 00:28:23,662
而不用承担一天工作的沉重负担。
without the crushing burden of a day job.

331
00:28:25,581 --> 00:28:27,082
我再去拿杯酒。
I'm gonna get another drink.

332
00:28:36,008 --> 00:28:38,135
-我们应该试试吗? -什么?
- Should we try it? - What?

333
00:28:38,218 --> 00:28:39,803
召唤糖果人?
Summon the Candyman?

334
00:28:39,887 --> 00:28:43,140
嗯，是的，不。黑人不需要召唤什么狗屁。
Uh, yeah, no. Black people don't need to be summoning shit.

335
00:28:43,223 --> 00:28:46,226
-得了吧，那是无稽之谈。-这不是河口。
- Come on, that is nonsense. - This isn't the bayou.

336
00:28:46,310 --> 00:28:48,187
在芝加哥，那是白人的狗屁。
In Chicago, that's white people shit.

337
00:28:48,270 --> 00:28:49,563
嗯。
Mmm.

338
00:28:49,646 --> 00:28:52,900
-糖果人。糖果人。 -闭嘴。嘿，停下来。
- Candyman. Candyman. - Zip it. Hey, stop.

339
00:28:58,655 --> 00:28:59,865
-糖果人。 -别说了。
- Candyman. - Stop it.

340
00:29:05,204 --> 00:29:07,372
当然，我做了。我欠布里安娜一个人情。
Of course, I did. I owe Brianna one.

341
00:29:07,456 --> 00:29:10,667
她三年前把我介绍给西尔玛·戈登。
She introduced me to Thelma Golden three years ago.

342
00:29:10,751 --> 00:29:13,212
你还欠我一个人情呢。
You still owe me one for that.

343
00:29:13,295 --> 00:29:14,588
而且，呃……
And, uh…

344
00:29:14,671 --> 00:29:15,881
啊…
Ah…

345
00:29:15,964 --> 00:29:17,382
托尼,是吗?
Tony, is it?

346
00:29:17,466 --> 00:29:20,219
我喜欢干涉主义策略。
I love interventionist strategy.

347
00:29:20,302 --> 00:29:23,305
传统绘画太累人了。
Conventional painting is such a drag.

348
00:29:23,388 --> 00:29:25,057
我喜欢你把那些该死的东西
I love that you hid those fucking things

349
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:27,351
藏在一个没有灯的储藏室里。真聪明。
in a storage room with the lights out. So smart.

350
00:29:27,434 --> 00:29:29,603
你所有的工作都是基于现成的材料吗?
Is all your work based on found material?

351
00:29:29,686 --> 00:29:31,647
你从哪找到那些画的?
I mean, where'd you even find those paintings?

352
00:29:31,730 --> 00:29:33,023
沙漠里的旧货店?
Thrift store in the desert?

353
00:29:34,608 --> 00:29:37,528
我在画室里找到的。
I found them in the studio where I painted them.

354
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:40,572
你这个笨蛋。
You goofy-ass fuck.

355
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:44,243
还有你们，你们这些该死的土狼。
And you, you fucking hyenas.

356
00:29:44,326 --> 00:29:46,453
-哦，搞什么鬼? -嗨。我们走吧。克莱夫。
- Oh, what the fuck? - Hey. Let's go. Clive.

357
00:29:48,121 --> 00:29:49,915
-安东尼。-你以为你会在这里
- Anthony. - You think you'd even be here

358
00:29:49,998 --> 00:29:51,083
如果不是因为她?
if it wasn't for her?

359
00:29:51,166 --> 00:29:53,168
你不是该囤点事后避孕药
Shouldn't you be stocking up on morning-after pills

360
00:29:53,252 --> 00:29:55,045
来适应你的暑期实习计划?
to accommodate your summer intern program?

361
00:29:55,128 --> 00:29:57,923
这不是自发的。你在银行里有一个。
That's not spontaneous. You had that one in the bank.

362
00:29:58,006 --> 00:29:59,675
是啊，我有，贱人。
Yeah, I did, bitch.

363
00:30:01,677 --> 00:30:04,137
没关系。我能接受被人叫贱人。
That's fine. I can take being called a bitch.

364
00:30:04,847 --> 00:30:07,516
-没事的。我上避孕环了。 -我知道。
- It's fine. I'm on a NuvaRing. - I know.

365
00:30:09,142 --> 00:30:10,435
谢谢你的到来。
Thanks for coming.

366
00:30:36,461 --> 00:30:38,547
我他妈受不了了。
I'm so fucking over it.

367
00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:41,216
老实说，如果她不能控制她的男人…
Honestly, if she can't control her man…

368
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:42,593
她失去了控制。
She lost control.

369
00:30:42,676 --> 00:30:45,387
就像，我能得到一句谢谢吗?不!
It's like, do I get a thank you? No!

370
00:30:45,470 --> 00:30:48,307
我的表演能得到道歉吗?
Do I get an apology for that display?

371
00:30:48,390 --> 00:30:50,267
暴行展览。
Atrocity exhibition.

372
00:30:51,101 --> 00:30:55,772
把她男朋友塞进我的夏季秀是她犯的第一个错误。
Shoehorning her boyfriend into my summer show was her first mistake.

373
00:30:55,856 --> 00:30:57,941
-只有错误。 -她做完了。
- Only mistake. - She's done.

374
00:30:58,025 --> 00:31:00,152
她只能怪她自己。
And she has no one to blame but herself.

375
00:31:00,235 --> 00:31:03,071
别把策划和你操的人混在一起。
Don't mix curation with who you're fucking.

376
00:31:04,364 --> 00:31:05,782
爱会把我们分开。
Love will tear us apart.

377
00:31:05,866 --> 00:31:08,327
天啊，杰里卡，我们明白了。你喜欢“快乐小分队”。
Jesus, Jerrica, we get it. You like Joy Division.

378
00:31:14,416 --> 00:31:17,002
-那是什么来着? -什么事?
- What's that thing again? - What thing?

379
00:31:18,545 --> 00:31:19,546
你知道的。
You know.

380
00:31:20,672 --> 00:31:22,716
对着镜子说五遍什么?
Say what five times in the mirror?

381
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:24,968
你告诉我。
You tell me.

382
00:31:25,052 --> 00:31:27,387
你校对了新闻稿，杰里卡。
You proofread the press release, Jerrica.

383
00:31:28,514 --> 00:31:29,681
“糖果人”。
"Candyman."

384
00:31:30,974 --> 00:31:34,269
但别这么做，好吗?
But don't do it, okay?

385
00:31:35,187 --> 00:31:36,939
我不想你今晚就死。
I don't want you to die tonight.

386
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:40,651
至少，直到我们……
At least, not until we…

387
00:31:41,401 --> 00:31:42,444
他妈的。
fuck.

388
00:31:44,363 --> 00:31:45,614
你对我一点用都没有。
You're no good for me.

389
00:31:45,697 --> 00:31:47,950
你知道吗?我改变主意了。这样做。
You know what? I changed my mind. Do it.

390
00:31:48,033 --> 00:31:49,826
恋尸癖一直在我的遗愿清单上。
Necrophilia's always been on my bucket list.

391
00:31:49,910 --> 00:31:51,078
嗯。
Mmm.

392
00:31:53,413 --> 00:31:55,040
嗯。
Mmm.

393
00:31:56,583 --> 00:31:57,668
嗯。
Hmm.

394
00:31:57,751 --> 00:31:59,044
那就在这里做吧。
Let's do it here then.

395
00:31:59,670 --> 00:32:00,712
嗯。
Um.

396
00:32:00,796 --> 00:32:03,298
-不，我一整天都在这儿。 -来吧。
- No, I've been here all day. - Come on.

397
00:32:10,973 --> 00:32:12,683
嗯。
Mmm.

398
00:32:13,892 --> 00:32:16,937
-糖果人。-你是认真的吗?
- Candyman. - Are you serious?

399
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:18,188
安静,婊子。
Quiet, bitch.

400
00:32:26,029 --> 00:32:27,489
糖果人。
Candyman.

401
00:32:28,156 --> 00:32:29,658
糖果人。
Candyman.

402
00:32:32,494 --> 00:32:34,288
糖果人。 -嗯。
- Candyman. - Mmm.

403
00:32:34,371 --> 00:32:35,706
糖果人。
Candyman.

404
00:32:53,223 --> 00:32:54,308
看到了吗?
See?

405
00:32:54,391 --> 00:32:55,976
什么都没有。
Nothing.

406
00:32:56,059 --> 00:32:57,811
到此为止。
So much for that.

407
00:33:06,945 --> 00:33:07,946
这是真的吗？
Is this real?

408
00:33:09,948 --> 00:33:11,742
这是真的吗？
This is real?

409
00:33:11,825 --> 00:33:13,118
卧槽？
What the fuck?

410
00:33:15,078 --> 00:33:16,788
卧槽!
What the fuck!

411
00:33:22,753 --> 00:33:24,004
喂?
Hello?

412
00:33:34,848 --> 00:33:36,141
卧……
What…

413
00:33:41,772 --> 00:33:45,651
……槽？
…the fuck?

414
00:33:52,533 --> 00:33:53,909
哦!
Oh!

415
00:33:53,992 --> 00:33:55,452
他妈的!
Fuck!

416
00:33:56,161 --> 00:33:59,206
他妈的。必须更快。
Fuck me. Must go faster.

417
00:33:59,289 --> 00:34:01,333
必须更快!
Must go faster!

418
00:34:08,799 --> 00:34:09,800
他妈的!
Fuck!

419
00:34:10,967 --> 00:34:12,302
他妈的!不!
Fuck! No!

420
00:34:14,096 --> 00:34:15,389
不!不!
No! No!

421
00:34:17,766 --> 00:34:19,643
住手！住手！住手！
Stop! Stop! Stop!

422
00:34:20,561 --> 00:34:22,603
救命!不!不!
Help! No! No!

423
00:35:06,064 --> 00:35:07,858
他妈的混蛋。
Fucking assholes.

424
00:35:33,634 --> 00:35:38,013
凶杀案发生在夜司机画廊的团体展览开幕之后。
The murders occurred after Night Driver Gallery's group show opening.

425
00:35:38,096 --> 00:35:40,390
尸体是在一件艺术品前被发现的
The bodies were discovered in front of a piece

426
00:35:40,474 --> 00:35:44,102
来自冉冉升起的新星安东尼·麦考伊的《说出我的名字》
from rising star Anthony McCoy entitled Say My Name.

427
00:35:44,186 --> 00:35:47,105
执法人员表示，他们正在调查……
Law enforcement officers say they are investigating...

428
00:35:52,486 --> 00:35:53,820
说出我的名字。
Say My Name.

429
00:35:56,907 --> 00:35:58,325
他们说了我的名字。
They said my name.

430
00:36:00,369 --> 00:36:01,745
《说出我的名字》。
And Say My Name.

431
00:36:06,875 --> 00:36:08,001
我不知道，只是…
I don't know, just…

432
00:36:09,253 --> 00:36:11,129
我想，被提及也挺酷的。
It's cool to be mentioned, I guess.

433
00:36:15,509 --> 00:36:17,094
我的意思是,很明显……
I mean, obviously…

434
00:36:18,053 --> 00:36:20,180
显然,这是……显然,这是可怕的。
Obviously, it's... Obviously, it's awful.

435
00:36:21,056 --> 00:36:22,057
真的吗?
Really?

436
00:36:40,450 --> 00:36:42,035
克莱夫?
Clive?

437
00:36:45,998 --> 00:36:47,249
爸爸?
Dad?

438
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:54,006
你为什么坐在那里?
Why are you sitting there?

439
00:36:57,301 --> 00:36:58,468
嘿。
Hey.

440
00:37:00,596 --> 00:37:03,473
我打赌你不知道你爸爸会飞。
I bet you didn't know your daddy could fly.

441
00:37:04,516 --> 00:37:05,517
是吗?
Did you?

442
00:37:08,604 --> 00:37:09,813
嗯,我可以。
Well, I can.

443
00:37:40,427 --> 00:37:41,512
安东尼?
Anthony?

444
00:37:51,730 --> 00:37:52,981
安东尼?
Anthony?

445
00:37:55,651 --> 00:37:56,860
你还好吗?
Are you okay?

446
00:37:58,695 --> 00:38:00,572
我做了个噩梦。
I had a bad dream.

447
00:38:01,365 --> 00:38:02,449
我也是。
Me too.

448
00:38:04,034 --> 00:38:05,118
是什么?
What was it?

449
00:38:06,828 --> 00:38:07,913
什么是什么?
What was what?

450
00:38:09,331 --> 00:38:10,374
梦。
The dream.

451
00:38:15,295 --> 00:38:17,548
我会出去。我马上就出去。
I'll be out. I'll be out in a minute.

452
00:38:21,718 --> 00:38:22,845
安东尼?
Anthony?

453
00:38:26,473 --> 00:38:31,478
那么，我不知道这是什么，也不知道你是怎么知道的，
So, I don't know what this is, or how you knew it existed,

454
00:38:31,562 --> 00:38:33,939
但这是海伦·莱尔名下的全部资料。
but this is everything we have under Helen Lyle.

455
00:38:34,022 --> 00:38:36,650
我不知道。所以我才要问。
I didn't. That's why I had to ask.

456
00:38:39,027 --> 00:38:40,863
好吧，给你。
Well, here it is.

457
00:38:40,946 --> 00:38:42,447
谢谢，我很感激。
Thanks, I appreciate it.

458
00:38:42,531 --> 00:38:45,158
当然。我在《犯罪鉴识实录》里找到的。
Of course. I found it filed under True Crimes.

459
00:38:45,242 --> 00:38:47,369
半工半读的本科生是最差的。
Work-study undergrads are the worst.

460
00:38:47,452 --> 00:38:48,954
那么，你是学生吗?
So, are you a student?

461
00:38:52,374 --> 00:38:55,794
这些年来卡布里尼发生的一些事情，
Some of the things that have happened in Cabrini over the years,

462
00:38:55,878 --> 00:38:59,798
暴力是如此极端，如此怪异。
violence just so extreme, so bizarre.

463
00:38:59,882 --> 00:39:03,969
暴力几乎成了一种仪式。
It's almost as if violence became a ritual.

464
00:39:04,052 --> 00:39:05,345
最糟糕的部分,
The worst part,

465
00:39:06,013 --> 00:39:08,182
居民们不敢报警。
the residents are afraid to call the police.

466
00:39:08,265 --> 00:39:12,102
也许是一种荣誉准则，害怕警察本身。
A code of honor, perhaps, fear of the police themselves.

467
00:39:12,186 --> 00:39:15,105
简单的回答总是：“糖果人干的。”
The easy answer is always, "Candyman did it."

468
00:39:15,189 --> 00:39:17,691
召唤游戏本身可以连接。
The summoning game itself could be connected.

469
00:39:17,774 --> 00:39:20,819
我是说，很明显这不是一个人编的。
I mean, it's clear that no one person makes this up.

470
00:39:20,903 --> 00:39:24,156
这源于社区的集体潜意识。
This grew from the community's collective subconscious.

471
00:39:24,239 --> 00:39:28,493
生存工具是从保护自身及其
A survival tool evolved from the need to protect itself

472
00:39:28,577 --> 00:39:29,703
儿童免受社区恐怖……
and its children…

473
00:39:29,786 --> 00:39:31,622
……的需要演变而来的。
…from the horrors of the community.

474
00:39:33,665 --> 00:39:35,751
伯纳黛特和我试过召唤
Bernadette and I tried the summoning.

475
00:39:35,834 --> 00:39:38,295
它的效果是惊人的。
It's amazing how effective it can be.

476
00:39:38,378 --> 00:39:42,341
暗示你正被潜伏在你自己
The suggestion that you're being followed or stalked

477
00:39:42,424 --> 00:39:45,844
倒影中的东西跟随或跟踪。
by something lurking in your own reflection.

478
00:39:45,928 --> 00:39:47,095
但我明白了。
But I get it.

479
00:39:49,264 --> 00:39:52,601
……令人陶醉的，莫名其妙的
…intoxicating, inexplicably alluring

480
00:39:52,684 --> 00:39:55,020
关于见到鬼的承诺的诱惑。
about the promise of seeing a ghost.

481
00:39:55,103 --> 00:39:56,104
就像是……
Almost as if…

482
00:40:03,153 --> 00:40:04,238
不是吧。
Come on.

483
00:40:25,175 --> 00:40:26,552
噢!
Ow!

484
00:41:15,642 --> 00:41:16,768
嘿。
Hey.

485
00:41:21,356 --> 00:41:22,357
原谅我。
Excuse me.

486
00:41:22,441 --> 00:41:25,694
她听到了一个声音。你记得她的名字吗?
And she heard a noise. Do you remember her name?

487
00:41:25,777 --> 00:41:28,071
我记得她叫露丝·吉恩，
I think her name was Ruthie Jean,

488
00:41:28,155 --> 00:41:30,741
她听到了砰砰的响声…
and she heard this banging and smashing…

489
00:41:30,824 --> 00:41:33,035
好像有人想在墙上挖个洞。
…like somebody was trying to make a hole in the wall.

490
00:41:33,118 --> 00:41:35,120
于是，露丝拨打了911
So, Ruthie called 911

491
00:41:35,204 --> 00:41:37,956
她说：“有人穿过墙来了。”
and she said, "There's somebody coming through the walls."

492
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:39,708
他们不相信她。
And they didn't believe her.

493
00:41:39,791 --> 00:41:42,211
他们觉得那女人疯了，对吧?
They thought the lady was crazy, right?

494
00:41:42,294 --> 00:41:44,087
嗯哼。所以她又打了911
Mm-hmm. So, she called 911 again,

495
00:41:44,171 --> 00:41:46,381
他们还是不相信她。
and they still didn't believe her.

496
00:41:46,465 --> 00:41:49,343
当他们终于赶到时，她已经死了。
And when they finally got there, she was dead.

497
00:41:49,426 --> 00:41:50,761
她中枪了吗？
Was she shot?

498
00:41:52,137 --> 00:41:53,388
没有。
No.

499
00:41:53,472 --> 00:41:56,850
不，她是被钩子杀死的。
No, she was killed with a hook.

500
00:41:56,934 --> 00:41:58,477
是的。
Yeah.

501
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:00,145
是真的吗?
Is it true?

502
00:42:00,229 --> 00:42:02,773
是啊，是的。我在报纸上看到的。
Yeah, it is. I read it in the papers.

503
00:42:02,856 --> 00:42:04,691
糖果人杀了她。
Candyman killed her.

504
00:42:05,442 --> 00:42:08,195
是的,但是……我对那件事一无所知。
Yeah, but... I don't know nothing about that.

505
00:42:09,530 --> 00:42:10,531
喂?
Hello?

506
00:42:11,198 --> 00:42:12,241
我要出去。
I'm going out.

507
00:42:13,867 --> 00:42:15,702
我们今晚要吃饭。
We have the dinner tonight.

508
00:42:15,786 --> 00:42:17,371
我不知道还要多久。
I don't know how long I'll be.

509
00:42:17,454 --> 00:42:21,500
杰克·海德从纽约来，但他从来没来过芝加哥。
Jack Hyde is coming in from New York, and he never comes to Chicago.

510
00:42:22,376 --> 00:42:24,920
所以，请不要搞砸了。
So, please don't fuck this up.

511
00:42:25,003 --> 00:42:26,755
我会没事的。
I'll be fine.

512
00:42:26,839 --> 00:42:27,881
为我。
For me.

513
00:42:28,590 --> 00:42:31,134
别给我搞砸了。
Don't fuck this up for me.

514
00:43:16,805 --> 00:43:20,475
这几周真是太疯狂了。
It's been a crazy couple of weeks.

515
00:43:21,852 --> 00:43:23,854
这是一种温和的说法。
That is putting it mildly.

516
00:43:26,023 --> 00:43:29,735
你可以想象，我写的不再是展览评论了。
As you can imagine, what I'm writing is no longer an exhibition review.

517
00:43:29,818 --> 00:43:30,986
这是……
It's...

518
00:43:31,069 --> 00:43:33,947
现在它被扩展成一篇更大的文章，
It's now expanded into a larger article,

519
00:43:34,031 --> 00:43:35,657
是什么影响了这两项工作
which impacts both the works

520
00:43:35,741 --> 00:43:39,745
以及凶案发生时的情况
and the circumstances around the murders.

521
00:43:39,828 --> 00:43:41,038
我明白了。
I see.

522
00:43:41,121 --> 00:43:45,042
我想听听你的几句话。
So, I just wanted to get a few quotes from you.

523
00:43:46,460 --> 00:43:48,003
嗯，我什么都不知道。
Well, I don't know much of anything.

524
00:43:48,086 --> 00:43:50,547
你的作品太恐怖了，那是…
Your work is so macabre, and that's…

525
00:43:51,965 --> 00:43:55,052
考虑到发生的事情，这很有趣。
pretty interesting, considering what happened.

526
00:43:56,178 --> 00:43:57,638
这是一个巧合。
That's a coincidence.

527
00:43:57,721 --> 00:44:00,098
我不是说你有错，
I'm not saying that you're at fault,

528
00:44:00,182 --> 00:44:02,809
而且我当然不是说通过集体讲故事表现出来的
and I'm certainly not saying that a ghost manifested

529
00:44:02,893 --> 00:44:06,939
鬼魂杀死了一位著名的艺术品经销商。
by collective storytelling killed a prominent art dealer.

530
00:44:07,022 --> 00:44:09,191
我只是说…
I'm just saying that…

531
00:44:10,734 --> 00:44:13,654
突然之间，你的工作似乎…
all of a sudden, your work seems…

532
00:44:15,739 --> 00:44:17,199
没完没了。
eternal.

533
00:44:20,285 --> 00:44:21,453
接下来是什么?
What's next?

534
00:44:23,705 --> 00:44:25,707
我把工作扩展成一个系列。
I'm expanding the work into a series.

535
00:44:27,376 --> 00:44:29,545
我想办个个人秀。
I'm hoping to do a solo show.

536
00:44:30,712 --> 00:44:32,714
糖果人。传播这个词。
All about Candyman. Spread the word.

537
00:44:32,798 --> 00:44:34,591
嗯，我喜欢这个主意。
Mmm, I love that idea.

538
00:44:35,592 --> 00:44:40,264
我很惊讶你现在对我这篇文章的看法如此积极。
I'm surprised at how positive your take on my piece seems to be now.

539
00:44:41,265 --> 00:44:42,975
我越来越喜欢它了。
Well, it grew on me.

540
00:44:43,058 --> 00:44:45,686
-看来你不是很明白。-不，我明白。
- Seemed like you didn't quite get it. - No, I get it.

541
00:44:45,769 --> 00:44:49,273
是兜帽，高档化，等等。
It's the hood, gentrification, et cetera.

542
00:44:49,356 --> 00:44:51,692
艺术家们把兜帽升级了?
Artists gentrify the hood?

543
00:44:53,110 --> 00:44:54,987
你觉得兜帽男是谁做的?
Who do you think makes the hood?

544
00:44:56,613 --> 00:45:00,450
城市隔绝了一个社区，等着它死去。
The city cuts off a community and waits for it to die.

545
00:45:01,827 --> 00:45:03,996
然后他们邀请开发者加入
Then they invite developers in

546
00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:06,415
而且说，“嘿，你们这些艺术家，
and say, "Hey, you artists,

547

什么?这是事实。如果格雷迪出现在这里
What? It's the truth. If Grady came up in here,

683
00:56:10,287 --> 00:56:12,122
打碎镜子。
smashing mirrors.

684
00:56:13,790 --> 00:56:14,791
镜子。
Mirrors.

685
00:56:16,335 --> 00:56:17,336
他是对的。
He's right.

686
00:56:20,589 --> 00:56:22,090
-好的。 -你……
- All right. - You…

687
00:56:23,133 --> 00:56:25,219
照顾好露西。
take care of Lucy.

688
00:56:25,302 --> 00:56:27,596
现在是暂停时间。
And you are in time-out.

689
00:56:27,679 --> 00:56:28,805
过来。
Come here.

690
00:56:30,307 --> 00:56:31,517
散开。
Break it up.

691
00:56:36,813 --> 00:56:39,024
我和妈妈谈过了。
I spoke to Mom.

692
00:56:39,983 --> 00:56:42,402
她想关闭仓库，
She wants to close the storage unit out,

693
00:56:42,486 --> 00:56:45,364
所以我们终于要处理爸爸的工作了
so we finally have to deal with Dad's work.

694
00:56:45,447 --> 00:56:47,366
我在想也许我们可以
I was thinking maybe we could

695
00:56:48,575 --> 00:56:49,952
出售或…
sell or…

696
00:56:51,537 --> 00:56:55,541
-如果你想保留任何东西……-不，我不想这些东西留在我家里。
- if you want to keep anything… - No, I don't want any of that in my house.

697
00:56:55,624 --> 00:56:58,126
-谢谢。-然后，出售或做个秀。
- Thank you. - Then, sell or do a show.

698
00:56:58,210 --> 00:56:59,753
我觉得你应该开个地方。
I think you should open a space.

699
00:56:59,837 --> 00:57:03,674
特洛伊，我才不要做那个杀了他的东西的节目。
I'm not doing a show of the thing that killed him, Troy.

700
00:57:03,757 --> 00:57:05,968
你不能隐瞒一切，而且…
You can't hide everything, and…

701
00:57:06,051 --> 00:57:07,845
-希望它能消失。 -特洛伊……
- and just hope it goes away. - Troy…

702
00:57:07,928 --> 00:57:11,056
你没必要每次看到一个饱受折磨的艺术家精神崩溃的时候都在场。
You don't have to be there every time a tortured artist has a psychotic break.

703
00:57:16,728 --> 00:57:17,771
对不起。
I'm sorry.

704
00:57:20,023 --> 00:57:21,358
布里!
Bri.

705
00:57:27,030 --> 00:57:28,740
很高兴你来了。
I'm glad you're here.

706
00:57:30,826 --> 00:57:33,412
你想待多久就待多久，条件是你不去尝试
You can stay as long as you want, on the condition you don't try

707
00:57:33,495 --> 00:57:34,913
召唤糖果人。
and summon Candyman.

708
00:57:36,081 --> 00:57:37,791
谁会这么做?
Who would do that?

709
00:57:37,875 --> 00:57:39,835
有什么事吗?
What's up?

710
00:57:47,384 --> 00:57:49,970
特瑞娜这周末喝醉了。
Trina was fooked up this weekend.

711
00:57:50,053 --> 00:57:53,223
-伙计们，我的刘海该怎么办? -没人在乎你的刘海。
- Guys, what should I do about my bangs? - No one cares about your bangs.

712
00:57:53,307 --> 00:57:54,600
安妮卡，看这个。
Annika, look at this.

713
00:57:54,683 --> 00:57:57,728
特瑞纳的他妈的垃圾。看。看,看,看。
Trina's fucking trashed. Look. Watch, watch, watch.

714
00:57:57,811 --> 00:58:00,439
-萨曼塔。-天啊，太可悲了。
- Samantha. - Oh, my God, that's so sad.

715
00:58:01,148 --> 00:58:04,443
-哦,该死。-看看这个大块头的呕吐物。
- Oh, shit. - Look at this chunky-ass vomit.

716
00:58:04,526 --> 00:58:06,904
天啊，当着大家的面。
Oh, my gosh, in front of everyone.

717
00:58:06,987 --> 00:58:08,780
你们听说过糖果人吗?
Have you guys heard of Candyman?

718
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:12,367
他妈的。我改变主意了。我不会这么做的。
Fuck this. I changed my mind. I'm not gonna do it.

719
00:58:12,451 --> 00:58:16,371
-拜托，博夫。别像个娘们儿。 -为什么不呢？这是一件温暖而美妙的事情。
- Come on, Boof. Don't be a pussy. - Why not? It's a warm and wonderful thing.

720
00:58:16,455 --> 00:58:17,956
博夫，我们已经就位了。
Boof, we're already in formation.

721
00:58:18,040 --> 00:58:19,583
-好。 -好吧,准备好了吗?
- Fine. - Okay, ready?

722
00:58:19,666 --> 00:58:21,376
糖果人。
Candyman.

723
00:58:21,460 --> 00:58:22,961
说齐了，笨蛋。
All at once, dumbass.

724
00:58:26,548 --> 00:58:27,674
糖果人。
Candyman.

725
00:58:29,218 --> 00:58:30,469
糖果人。
Candyman.

726
00:58:32,262 --> 00:58:33,472
糖果人。
Candyman.

727
00:58:36,099 --> 00:58:37,893
-不是今天。不是今天。 -来吧。
- Not today. Not today. - Come on.

728
00:58:37,976 --> 00:58:39,686
再来两次。
Two more times.

729
00:58:44,608 --> 00:58:46,151
糖果人。
Candyman.

730
00:58:46,235 --> 00:58:47,361
再来一次。
One more.

731
00:58:49,530 --> 00:58:51,031
糖果人。
Candyman.

732
00:58:53,534 --> 00:58:56,119
好吧，我们还活着，所以…
Well, we're still alive, so…

733
00:59:00,290 --> 00:59:01,750
嗨,蒂娜。
Hey, Trina.

734
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:04,169
我们走吧。
Let's go.

735
00:59:09,132 --> 00:59:12,803
嘿，崔妮，宿醉还好吗?你真是一团糟。
Hey, Triney, how's that hangover? You're such a mess.

736
00:59:16,390 --> 00:59:19,852
-崔娜被搞得一团糟。-别让她喝那么多。
- Trina was fucking trashed. - Don't let her drink that much.

737
00:59:19,935 --> 00:59:21,353
那是她和她的神之间的事。
That's between her and her god.

738
00:59:22,187 --> 00:59:24,147
崔娜，你他妈的把门撞坏了。
Trina, you broke the fucking door.

739
00:59:28,068 --> 00:59:29,778
海莉，我还年轻不能死。开门。
Haley, I'm too young to die. Open it.

740
00:59:29,862 --> 00:59:31,530
我正在努力。
I'm working on it.

741
00:59:36,326 --> 00:59:37,327
家伙……
Guys…

742
00:59:37,411 --> 00:59:38,662
他妈的什么?
What the fuck?

743
00:59:38,745 --> 00:59:41,039
-等等，我忘带电子烟了。 -博夫。
- Wait, I forgot my vape. - Boof.

744
00:59:41,123 --> 00:59:43,750
你知道，我觉得你不应该…
You know, I don't think you should…

745
00:59:43,834 --> 00:59:45,210
博夫？
Boof?

746
00:59:46,003 --> 00:59:47,004
博夫？
Boof?

747
00:59:48,380 --> 00:59:49,756
博夫？
Boof?

748
00:59:51,925 --> 00:59:52,926
你在干什么?
What are you doing?

749
01:00:06,857 --> 01:00:10,027
-天啊，伙计们别犯傻了! -海莉！
- Oh, my God, guys. Stop being so stupid! - Haley!

750
01:00:25,334 --> 01:00:27,127
这一点都不好笑。
This isn't funny.

751
01:00:29,087 --> 01:00:31,590
伙计们，搞什么鬼？这一点都不好笑。
You guys, what the fuck? This isn't funny!

752
01:00:43,310 --> 01:00:45,812
不!
No!

753
01:00:53,111 --> 01:00:55,030
不!
No!

754
01:02:06,059 --> 01:02:08,145
我们一直在努力朝更新鲜的方向前进
We've been trying to move in a fresher direction

755
01:02:08,228 --> 01:02:09,563
在过去的几年里
for the past few years,

756
01:02:09,646 --> 01:02:13,775
我们的上一任馆长是个好人，但去那里很不容易。
and our last curator was a great guy, but just had a hard time getting there.

757
01:02:13,859 --> 01:02:16,695
嗯，我确实注意到了编排方面的变化
Well, I've certainly noticed a shift in programming

758
01:02:16,778 --> 01:02:19,615
-自从你来这里。-希望是最好的结果。
- since you started here. - Hopefully for the best.

759
01:02:20,115 --> 01:02:22,784
我很高兴终于能在杰克的晚餐上见到你。
I'm so happy I finally got to meet you at Jack's dinner.

760
01:02:22,868 --> 01:02:25,495
是的。他以前一直想让我们在一起。
Yes. He's been trying to get us together before.

761
01:02:25,579 --> 01:02:28,665
克莱夫太疯狂了。
It's crazy about Clive.

762
01:02:28,749 --> 01:02:31,210
我听说是你发现了尸体。
I heard you were the one to find the bodies.

763
01:02:31,293 --> 01:02:32,628
是的…
Yeah…

764
01:02:33,879 --> 01:02:35,797
你真的出现了
You've really emerged

765
01:02:35,881 --> 01:02:39,593
作为其中一个有趣的人物。
as an interesting figure amidst all this.

766
01:02:39,676 --> 01:02:42,346
你的演出听起来也很不错。
The show you put together sounded so good too.

767
01:02:42,429 --> 01:02:45,641
你是如此勇敢地拥抱无形。
You were so brave to embrace formlessness.

768
01:02:45,724 --> 01:02:50,145
事实上，有很多尸体……数字显示。
Actually, there were a lot of bodies... figures in the show.

769
01:02:50,229 --> 01:02:51,855
就像阿诺德的作品。
Like Arnold's work.

770
01:02:51,939 --> 01:02:57,236
很长时间以来，抽象一直是指索引一种升华的情感状态，
For so long, abstraction has been about indexing a sublimated emotional state,

771
01:02:57,319 --> 01:03:00,239
-我只想把注意力放在尸体上。-当然，但我是说，
- and I just wanted to focus on the body. - Of course, but I mean,

772
01:03:00,322 --> 01:03:03,200
最近的悲剧和你父亲的遗产，
between the recent tragedies and your father's legacy,

773
01:03:03,283 --> 01:03:05,702
你的故事很精彩。
you've got a fascinating story.

774
01:03:06,620 --> 01:03:08,247
对。
Right.

775
01:03:08,330 --> 01:03:10,707
还有你对新兴人才的眼光。
And your eye for emerging talent.

776
01:03:10,791 --> 01:03:13,126
你和安东尼·麦考伊共事多久了?
How long have you worked with Anthony McCoy?

777
01:03:14,044 --> 01:03:15,838
就几年而已。
Just a couple years.

778
01:03:15,921 --> 01:03:19,842
我的董事会成员对麦考伊的工作议论纷纷。
My board members are buzzing about McCoy's work.

779
01:03:19,925 --> 01:03:24,346
看来我们可以开始讨论"项目室"的演出了。
Feels like a Project Room show is something we could start talking about.

780
01:03:25,639 --> 01:03:28,433
当然，还有其他你看上的艺术家。
And of course, any other artist you have your eye on.

781
01:03:34,982 --> 01:03:38,277
近北侧社区，曾经被称为卡布里尼-格林，
The Near North Side community, once known as Cabrini-Green,

782
01:03:38,360 --> 01:03:42,406
被戈林预科学校的恶性大屠杀震惊了。
is stunned by the vicious mass murder at Golin College Prep.

783
01:03:42,489 --> 01:03:45,450
警方发现了与艺术界谋杀的惊人联系，
Police have found a startling link to the art world murders,

784
01:03:45,534 --> 01:03:48,620
尤其是一件称作《说出我的名字》，
in particular a piece called Say My Name,

785
01:03:48,704 --> 01:03:51,456
这是写在浴室墙上受害者的血里的。
which was written in the victims' blood on the bathroom wall.

786
01:03:51,540 --> 01:03:53,667
欢迎回来，麦考伊先生。
Welcome back, Mr. McCoy.

787
01:03:53,750 --> 01:03:55,002
什么?
What?

788
01:03:55,544 --> 01:03:57,671
我在你的档案里看到你出生在这里。
I saw in your file you were born here.

789
01:04:00,340 --> 01:04:02,176
我出生在南区。
I was born on the South Side.

790
01:04:03,844 --> 01:04:05,721
不，上面说你出生在这里。
No, it says you were born here.

791
01:04:07,598 --> 01:04:10,142
不管怎样，你及时赶到是件好事。
Regardless, it's good that you came in when you did.

792
01:04:10,225 --> 01:04:13,729
我们得马上让你入院进行监控，再做些检查。
We need to admit you immediately for monitoring and do some more testing.

793
01:04:45,052 --> 01:04:47,304
安东尼，你去哪了?
Anthony, where have you been?

794
01:04:55,437 --> 01:04:56,855
你的手怎么了?
What happened to your hand?

795
01:04:57,648 --> 01:04:59,274
看起来不好。
Looks bad.

796
01:05:01,026 --> 01:05:04,071
去了北河纪念医院，卡布里尼附近。
Went to River North Memorial, near Cabrini.

797
01:05:06,073 --> 01:05:07,908
他们马上把我治好了。
They fixed me right up.

798
01:05:10,452 --> 01:05:11,745
你一直在作画？
You've been painting?

799
01:05:14,623 --> 01:05:18,585
是啊，我受到了很多启发，
Yeah, I've been inspired a lot, actually,

800
01:05:18,669 --> 01:05:20,462
被卡布里尼。
by Cabrini.

801
01:05:21,505 --> 01:05:23,423
你想喝茶吗?
You want some tea?

802
01:05:23,507 --> 01:05:25,551
我听过一个关于火灾的故事。
I heard a story about a fire.

803
01:05:26,343 --> 01:05:28,387
杀了一个叫海伦·莱尔的女人。
Killed a woman named Helen Lyle.

804
01:05:29,721 --> 01:05:31,348
一个婴儿被带走了。
A baby that was taken.

805
01:05:32,224 --> 01:05:34,393
他们以前叫它糖果人。
Something they used to call Candyman.

806
01:05:36,937 --> 01:05:38,647
别。
Don't.

807
01:05:38,730 --> 01:05:40,148
别说。
Don't say that.

808
01:05:44,236 --> 01:05:47,030
你说我出生在南区。
You told me I was born on the South Side.

809
01:05:47,114 --> 01:05:49,408
我是在你记得的那个家里把你养大的。
I did raise you in the home you remember.

810
01:05:51,618 --> 01:05:55,122
但你出生在北河纪念医院

811
01:05:55,205 --> 01:05:57,916
头两年住在卡布里尼。
and spent the first two years in Cabrini.

812
01:05:59,126 --> 01:06:00,752
你为什么撒谎?
Why did you lie?

813
01:06:02,588 --> 01:06:04,006
为了保护你。
To protect you.

814
01:06:09,011 --> 01:06:10,137
从什么?
From what?

815
01:06:13,557 --> 01:06:18,604
我只是想让你快乐正常地
I just wanted you to grow up happy

816
01:06:18,687 --> 01:06:20,230
长大。
and normal.

817
01:06:26,528 --> 01:06:28,155
我看起来正常吗，妈妈?
Do I look normal, Mama?

818
01:06:33,827 --> 01:06:35,746
我必须知道。
I have to know.

819
01:06:37,456 --> 01:06:38,457
现在。
Now.

820
01:06:48,884 --> 01:06:53,305
你刚被抓的时候，我以为是她干的。
When you first got taken, I thought she was the one who did it.

821
01:07:07,236 --> 01:07:11,156
你刚被抓的时候，我以为是她干的。
When you first got taken, I thought she was the one who did it.

822
01:07:12,115 --> 01:07:13,200
海伦。
Helen.

823
01:07:18,038 --> 01:07:20,874
我在她公寓里发现她时，
The way I found her in her apartment,

824
01:07:20,958 --> 01:07:22,501
满身是血。
covered in blood.

825
01:07:23,961 --> 01:07:26,004
我们都认为她疯了。
We all thought she was crazy.

826
01:07:32,177 --> 01:07:33,846
但那不是她。
But it wasn't her.

827
01:07:38,141 --> 01:07:39,726
是他。
It was him.

828
01:07:43,522 --> 01:07:45,440
他对你有目的。
He had a purpose for you.

829
01:07:47,484 --> 01:07:49,152
他选择了你
He chose you to be

830
01:07:49,236 --> 01:07:51,572
他的受害者之一。
one of his victims.

831
01:07:52,573 --> 01:07:55,659
他想让你被烧死。
He wanted you to burn in that fire.

832
01:07:55,742 --> 01:07:58,078
但她把你拉了出来…
But she pulled you out…

833
01:07:59,872 --> 01:08:02,124
把你还给了我
and gave you back to me.

834
01:08:08,422 --> 01:08:10,924
-我以为那晚就结束了。 -等等!
- I thought it ended that night. - Wait!

835
01:08:12,050 --> 01:08:14,803
在火中。我以为她跟我分手了。
In the fire. I thought she ended it.

836
01:08:17,014 --> 01:08:19,850
我们发誓再也不提他的名字。
And we vowed to never say his name again.

837
01:08:24,395 --> 01:08:25,898
但是…
But…

838
01:08:26,732 --> 01:08:30,736
有人违反了约定…
someone broke the pact and…

839
01:08:30,819 --> 01:08:32,069
他发现我。
He found me.

840
01:08:39,620 --> 01:08:40,871
对不起。
I'm sorry.

841
01:08:46,502 --> 01:08:49,712
安东尼，等等，等等。宝贝，等等。
Anthony, wait, wait. Baby, wait.

842
01:08:49,796 --> 01:08:51,548
你要去哪里?
Where are you going?

843
01:08:51,631 --> 01:08:54,343
安东尼，宝贝，等等。
Anthony, baby, wait, wait, wait.

844
01:09:47,604 --> 01:09:48,897
安东尼?
Anthony?

845
01:09:49,648 --> 01:09:50,858
我是特洛伊。
It is Troy.

846
01:09:51,942 --> 01:09:56,321
马上出来，让我看到你。
Come out immediately where I can see you.

847
01:09:56,405 --> 01:09:59,783
-快点。 -特洛伊，别说了。拜托，我的天啊。
- Immediately. - Troy, stop. Please, oh, my gosh.

848
01:09:59,867 --> 01:10:03,412
我们在收拾她的东西
We are picking up her things

849
01:10:03,495 --> 01:10:04,997
我们会……
and we will…

850
01:10:06,373 --> 01:10:08,542
和他们一起走。
be leaving with them.

851
01:10:08,625 --> 01:10:10,419
我明白了。是的，谢谢。
I see. Yeah, thanks.

852
01:10:11,253 --> 01:10:12,838
他也没和诺亚在一起。
He's not with Noah either.

853
01:10:13,881 --> 01:10:15,424
到底怎么回事?
What the hell is going on?

854
01:10:15,507 --> 01:10:18,886
-也许糖果人抓住了他的屁股。-这一点都不好笑，特洛伊。
- Maybe Candyman got his ass. - That's not funny, Troy.

855
01:10:58,550 --> 01:10:59,885
喂?
Hello?

856
01:11:11,146 --> 01:11:12,439
安东尼?
Anthony?

857
01:11:31,708 --> 01:11:33,252
不。
Nope.

858
01:11:47,933 --> 01:11:50,853
你好!打扰一下!
Hello! Excuse me!

859
01:11:50,936 --> 01:11:52,479
拜托!
Please!

860
01:12:07,160 --> 01:12:09,037
走开。
Go away.

861
01:12:09,121 --> 01:12:10,956
-我想玩。 -不。
- I wanna play. - No.

862
01:12:11,039 --> 01:12:13,792
-拜托。我不再害怕了。-去玩你的木偶吧。
- Please. I'm not scared anymore. - Go play with your puppets.

863
01:12:13,876 --> 01:12:16,420
如果你不让我进去，我就在你床上撒尿。
I'm gonna pee on your bed if you don't let me in.

864
01:12:16,503 --> 01:12:18,297
你现在太烦人了。
You're being so annoying right now.

865
01:12:18,380 --> 01:12:21,049
-你在干什么? -少管闲事。
- What are you doing? - Mind your business.

866
01:12:21,133 --> 01:12:23,510
来吧，让我玩。拜托。
Come on, let me play. Please.

867
01:12:23,594 --> 01:12:26,680
这个游戏是给成年人玩的，而你是个大孩子。
This game is for grown-ups, and you're a big baby.

868
01:12:26,763 --> 01:12:28,265
我又不是小孩子。
I'm not a baby.

869
01:12:28,348 --> 01:12:29,641
走开!
Go away!

870
01:12:33,604 --> 01:12:35,480
不，这行不通的。
No, this is not gonna work.

871
01:12:36,815 --> 01:12:38,192
糖果人。
Candyman.

872
01:12:39,359 --> 01:12:40,527
糖果人。
Candyman.

873
01:12:43,780 --> 01:12:45,282
糖果人。
Candyman.

874
01:12:46,617 --> 01:12:47,951
糖果人。
Candyman.

875
01:12:50,245 --> 01:12:51,747
糖果人。
Candyman.

876
01:12:53,832 --> 01:12:54,917
我说了……
I said…

877
01:12:56,877 --> 01:12:58,545
塞布丽娜?
Sabrina?

878
01:13:11,308 --> 01:13:12,476
谢尔曼。
Sherman.

879
01:13:22,653 --> 01:13:23,654
现在…
Now…

880
01:13:25,572 --> 01:13:26,949
我们有个证人。
we have a witness.

881
01:13:34,039 --> 01:13:36,124
我想我看到你要找的人了。
I think I saw the guy you're looking for.

882
01:13:36,208 --> 01:13:37,835
《说出我的名字》杀手。
The "Say My Name" killer.

883
01:13:37,918 --> 01:13:40,462
他在卡布里尼的房子里闲逛。
He's roaming around the row houses at Cabrini.

884
01:13:40,546 --> 01:13:42,089
一个黑人，30岁左右。
A Black man, around 30.

885
01:13:42,172 --> 01:13:46,093
他挥舞着鱼钩，说着疯话。我觉得他在下面杀人!
He was waving a hook and talking crazy. I think he's killing people down there!

886
01:13:47,386 --> 01:13:48,720
搞什么鬼？
What the fuck?

887
01:13:59,314 --> 01:14:00,566
搞什么鬼？
What the fuck?

888
01:14:02,484 --> 01:14:04,069
我是在这里受洗的。
I was baptized here.

889
01:14:06,738 --> 01:14:07,948
它难道不漂亮吗?
Isn't it beautiful?

890
01:14:08,031 --> 01:14:12,035
安……安……安……安东尼?
A... A... A... Anthony?

891
01:14:12,119 --> 01:14:16,290
哦，嗯……是啊，我想我现在有别的事了，嗯?
Oh, uh... Yeah, I guess I'm on some other shit now, huh?

892
01:14:18,250 --> 01:14:20,544
当某样东西留下污点时，
When something leaves a stain,

893
01:14:20,627 --> 01:14:23,130
即使你把它洗掉
even if you wash it out,

894
01:14:23,213 --> 01:14:24,214
它还在那里。
it's still there.

895
01:14:25,465 --> 01:14:26,675
你能感觉到。
You can feel it.

896
01:14:27,634 --> 01:14:30,220
在织物深处有一种变薄的感觉。
A thinning, deep in the fabric.

897
01:14:32,681 --> 01:14:35,559
这个社区陷入了困境。
This neighborhood got caught in a loop.

898
01:14:35,642 --> 01:14:39,479
那坨屎被弄脏了，
The shit got stained in the exact same spot,

899
01:14:39,563 --> 01:14:41,231
一遍又一遍,
over and over,

900
01:14:41,315 --> 01:14:43,942
直到它最终由内而外腐烂。
until it finally rotted from the inside out.

901
01:14:45,194 --> 01:14:48,280
他们拆了我们的房子，好搬回来住。
They tore down our homes, so they could move back in.

902
01:14:48,363 --> 01:14:50,741
我们需要糖果人。
We need Candyman.

903
01:14:51,617 --> 01:14:54,578
因为这次他会杀了他们的父亲
'Cause this time, he'll be killing their fathers,

904
01:14:55,329 --> 01:14:58,540
他们的孩子，他们的姐妹。
their babies, their sisters.

905
01:15:00,167 --> 01:15:04,963
我知道孩子回来只是时间问题，
I knew it was only a matter of time before the baby came back here,

906
01:15:05,047 --> 01:15:07,132
完全的对等。
in perfect symmetry.

907
01:15:07,216 --> 01:15:11,803
一个让糖果人夺回属于他的东西的机会。
A chance for Candyman to take back what's rightfully his.

908
01:15:13,013 --> 01:15:14,097
他的传奇。
His legend.

909
01:15:21,063 --> 01:15:22,189
手。
Hand.

910
01:15:23,065 --> 01:15:24,816
等等……
Wait…

911
01:15:24,900 --> 01:15:26,527
不，不，不，不!
No, no, no, no!

912
01:15:29,154 --> 01:15:30,364
安东尼!
Anthony!

913
01:15:39,373 --> 01:15:42,543
看，你真的可以把故事变成你自己的。
See, you can really make the story your own.

914
01:15:43,418 --> 01:15:46,630
但是……一些细节
But… …some of the specifics

915
01:15:46,713 --> 01:15:48,799
应该是一致的。
should be somewhat consistent.

916
01:16:00,811 --> 01:16:04,356
这是安东尼·麦考伊的故事，
Here we have the story of Anthony McCoy,

917
01:16:04,439 --> 01:16:06,316
失去理智的艺术家
artist who lost his mind,

918
01:16:06,400 --> 01:16:08,861
警察出现了，一句话也没说
and the cops showed up and shot him down in cold blood

919
01:16:08,944 --> 01:16:10,571
就把他残忍地打死了。
without even saying a word.

920
01:16:12,197 --> 01:16:15,450
好吧，如果你敢，就说出他的名字!
Well, say his name, if you dare!

921
01:16:15,534 --> 01:16:18,871
对着镜子说五遍。看看会发生什么。
Say it five times in a mirror. See what happens.

922
01:16:20,747 --> 01:16:24,293
一切结束后，他们会讲述他的故事，
When it's all done, they'll tell his story,

923
01:16:24,376 --> 01:16:26,962
糖果人会活下来…
and Candyman will live…

924
01:16:29,631 --> 01:16:30,716
…永远。
…forever.

925
01:16:32,926 --> 01:16:34,469
蜂群来了。
Here comes the swarm.

926
01:16:38,599 --> 01:16:40,225
你准备好参加圣礼了吗?
Are you ready for the sacrament?

927
01:16:46,440 --> 01:16:47,983
嘿!
Hey!

928
01:16:48,066 --> 01:16:50,194
你要去哪里?
Where you going?

929
01:16:50,277 --> 01:16:52,362
你不想吃块糖吗?
Don't you want a sweet?

930
01:17:00,120 --> 01:17:01,288
他妈的!
Fuck!

931
01:17:08,754 --> 01:17:10,339
你要去哪里?
Where you going?

932
01:17:15,677 --> 01:17:20,516
♬谁能让日出♬
♪ Who can make the sunrise ♪

933
01:17:22,809 --> 01:17:26,813
♬洒上露水？♬
♪ Sprinkle it with dew? ♪

934
01:18:10,065 --> 01:18:11,984
这地方再好不过了，宝贝。
This is as good a place as any, pet.

935
01:18:28,917 --> 01:18:30,210
我想他已经死了。
I think he's dead.

936
01:18:36,258 --> 01:18:37,342
布丽安娜。
Brianna.

937
01:18:58,363 --> 01:18:59,865
不,不!
No, no!

938
01:19:01,575 --> 01:19:03,493
起来，安东尼。起来。
Get up, Anthony. Get up.

939
01:19:04,661 --> 01:19:06,496
宝贝,宝贝,宝贝…
Baby, baby, baby…

940
01:19:06,580 --> 01:19:09,750
拜托。不。不。
Please. No. No.

941
01:19:09,833 --> 01:19:11,793
安东尼,宝贝。
Anthony, baby.

942
01:19:11,877 --> 01:19:14,505
-没关系。-请起来。
- It's okay. - Get up, please.

943
01:19:14,588 --> 01:19:18,008
拜托。请坚持住，安东尼，求你了。
Please. Please stay with me, Anthony, please.

944
01:19:18,091 --> 01:19:21,345
拜托，拜托，拜托。请起来。
Please, please, please. Please get up.

945
01:19:21,428 --> 01:19:23,472
请起来，安东尼。
Please get up, Anthony.

946
01:19:25,098 --> 01:19:26,141
别走。
Don't go.

947
01:19:26,225 --> 01:19:29,019
我们会帮你的。我们要送你去医院。
We're gonna get you help. We're gonna get you to a hospital.

948
01:19:29,102 --> 01:19:30,437
我们要送你去医院。
We're gonna get you to a hospital.

949
01:19:30,521 --> 01:19:32,147
在这里!
In here!

950
01:19:33,190 --> 01:19:35,067
-举起手来! -他只是需要…
- Put your hands up! - He just needs…

951
01:20:14,815 --> 01:20:16,149
哦,天哪。
Oh, my God.

952
01:20:25,242 --> 01:20:26,952
嘿。站好。
Hey. Stay on your feet.

953
01:20:27,035 --> 01:20:28,704
-快点。快走。-怎么回事?
- Come on. Move it. - What's going on?

954
01:20:28,787 --> 01:20:30,747
我们有两个嫌疑人，一个死了。
We got two suspects, one's down.

955
01:20:30,831 --> 01:20:32,875
-带她上车。 -快点。
- Get her in the car. - Hurry up.

956
01:20:34,626 --> 01:20:36,253
我们不知道该怎么办。
We didn't know what to do.

957
01:21:10,537 --> 01:21:13,582
你的人在里面的遭遇很不幸。
Very unfortunate what happened to your man in there.

958
01:21:16,210 --> 01:21:17,711
我们一直在找他。
We'd been looking for him.

959
01:21:19,046 --> 01:21:20,547

看到他的钩子，知道你有危险，

他别无选择，只能开枪。

听起来不对吗?

969

或者……

她是个帮凶。

糖果人。
Candyman.

985
01:23:15,329 --> 01:23:16,872
那他妈的是什么?
What the fuck is that?

986
01:23:18,540 --> 01:23:21,502
-糖果人。-糖果人?

987

What the fuck?

988
01:23:28,467 --> 01:23:29,760

马上趴到地上！快点！
Get on the ground now! Now!

993
01:23:44,024 --> 01:23:45,192
我勒个去！

994
01:23:47,027 --> 01:23:48,487
-让我进去。 -我不能!

搞什么鬼？
What the fuck?

01:24:17,683 --> 01:24:21,812
我是街上的血腥味。

在小巷中回响的嗡嗡声

1004
01:24:27,943 --> 01:24:31,154
他们会说我杀了无辜的人。
They will say I shed innocent blood.

1005
01:24:31,238 --> 01:24:33,574
你一点也不无辜
You are far from innocent,

1006
01:24:33,657 --> 01:24:35,492
但他们会说你是无辜的。

这才是最重要的。
