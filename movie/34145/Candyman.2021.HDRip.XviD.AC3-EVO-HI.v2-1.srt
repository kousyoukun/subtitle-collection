You don't want the moscato?

164
00:11:17,428 --> 00:11:19,264
- Moscato's a dessert wine.

- [kisses] Love you.

- [Bri] Nice to meet you.
- And, Anthony, get painting!

My sister's not trying to support you

- Come on.

He's funny.

He is ridiculous.

I was getting exhausted trying to keep up

I don't care.

I'm not trying to get creeped out
in my new apartment before bed.

Your new apartment is ghost-proof.

- It was on the Zillow listing.
- Our new apartment.

Uh, well…

00:12:54,275 --> 00:12:56,945
[Clive] This is Anthony McCoy
of two years ago.

202
00:12:57,028 --> 00:12:59,739
I want the Anthony McCoy of the future.

203
00:12:59,822 --> 00:13:03,201
I want the great Black hope
of the Chicago art scene of tomorrow.

That's the guy that I gave a solo show to

the trouble of replacing you
in the summer show,

who hasn't shown me what I'm putting up!

- I'm working on something.
- Dig into that history of yours, dude!

209
00:13:22,345 --> 00:13:24,848
I'm thinking about doing something
about the projects.

- And about how white supremacy…
- White people.

211
00:13:28,852 --> 00:13:31,563
Yeah, how it creates these spaces

- Yeah, like where you're from.

- Yeah. Bronzeville.
- South Side is kind of played.

Uh, or Cabrini-Green.

216

- Me too.

Bye, babe.

321
00:22:58,129 --> 00:23:02,342
[Anthony] Sherman's face was beaten
so badly that it was unrecognizable,

322
00:23:02,425 --> 00:23:05,011
and that's where the story started.

323
00:23:05,094 --> 00:23:08,014
About them seeing him around Cabrini.

324
00:23:08,097 --> 00:23:09,933
About him coming to get you.

325
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:15,772
Over time, his name disappears,
and he just becomes the Candyman.

326
00:23:17,232 --> 00:23:18,483
What do you think?

327
00:23:18,566 --> 00:23:20,109
Well…

328
00:23:20,193 --> 00:23:21,945
it's a pretty literal approach.

329
00:23:22,779 --> 00:23:25,198
Not much room for viewer
interpretation, you know.

330
00:23:25,281 --> 00:23:29,035
Moving from the symbolism of violence
to the actual depiction of it.

331
00:23:29,118 --> 00:23:31,996
Okay, but how is it hitting you?

332
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,498
It's…

333
00:23:34,415 --> 00:23:35,917
painful.

334
00:23:36,584 --> 00:23:40,046
I feel really connected to this.
I've never been this clear before.

335
00:23:41,464 --> 00:23:44,676
It's like I know exactly
what I'm meant to be doing right now.

336
00:23:45,927 --> 00:23:49,013
Babe, that's great.

337
00:23:51,099 --> 00:23:54,894
- And I'm sure Clive will be...
- Oh, there's one more thing.

338
00:23:55,728 --> 00:23:59,107
The legend is
if you say his name five times

339
00:23:59,190 --> 00:24:00,650
while looking in the mirror,

340
00:24:01,359 --> 00:24:04,571
he appears in the reflection
and kills you.

341
00:24:05,822 --> 00:24:08,449
So, I thought

342
00:24:08,533 --> 00:24:10,827
that we could…

343
00:24:10,910 --> 00:24:12,412
[laughs] What did you think?

344
00:24:12,495 --> 00:24:14,289
[whispering] Summon him.

345
00:24:14,372 --> 00:24:15,790
[scoffs]

346
00:24:15,874 --> 00:24:17,166
Hell no.

347
00:24:18,418 --> 00:24:19,794
No.

348
00:24:19,878 --> 00:24:21,337
Candyman.

349
00:24:21,421 --> 00:24:22,672
Anthony…

350
00:24:22,755 --> 00:24:25,508
- Candyman.
- Anthony, no.

351
00:24:25,592 --> 00:24:27,760
- Candyman.
- Stop. Stop it.

352
00:24:27,844 --> 00:24:29,387
- Candyman.
- Stop it!

353
00:24:29,470 --> 00:24:30,597
Okay.

354
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:33,057
- You better not do that last one.
- Okay, okay, okay.

355
00:24:36,019 --> 00:24:39,147
- [whispers] Candyman.
- Anthony, you play too much!

356
00:24:39,230 --> 00:24:40,565
Stop, stop, stop.

357
00:24:40,648 --> 00:24:42,442
What happened to your hand?

358
00:24:42,525 --> 00:24:44,777
- Fucking bee sting.
- Really?

359
00:24:44,861 --> 00:24:46,279
Yeah, that shit hurt.

360
00:24:46,362 --> 00:24:48,615
Mmm. Looks like it.

361
00:24:48,698 --> 00:24:50,867
- Kiss it.
- Get the fuck outta here.

362
00:24:51,743 --> 00:24:53,453
Help, help.

363
00:25:21,481 --> 00:25:23,024
[crowd chattering]

364
00:26:26,754 --> 00:26:28,214
[camera clicking]

365
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:31,176
- We can go now.
- Finally.

366
00:26:33,303 --> 00:26:37,307
Last year, we did a solo booth
at Frieze LA with Jameson.

367
00:26:37,390 --> 00:26:38,725
Phenomenal work.

368
00:26:38,808 --> 00:26:40,018
These are related works,

369
00:26:40,101 --> 00:26:45,231
but here, he's recreating
and looping archival footage.

370
00:26:46,858 --> 00:26:48,443
[Bri] Just take your time.

371
00:26:57,368 --> 00:26:59,746
This is quite a departure
from your previous work.

372
00:27:01,915 --> 00:27:03,166
Go ahead, open it.

373
00:27:11,299 --> 00:27:15,470
I'm trying to align these moments in time
that exist in the same place.

374
00:27:16,513 --> 00:27:18,223
The idea is to almost

375
00:27:18,306 --> 00:27:22,769
calibrate tragedy into a focused lineage
that culminates in the now.

376
00:27:23,770 --> 00:27:27,106
Brianna,
tell your boy not to hog the critic.

377
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:30,944
He's got a whole thing.

378
00:27:31,027 --> 00:27:35,573
Yeah, no, I know, I heard it.
It's complicated.

379
00:27:35,657 --> 00:27:39,410
She's interacting with the piece.

380
00:27:39,494 --> 00:27:42,914
[Anthony] The mirror invites you
to attempt the summoning yourself.

381
00:27:44,582 --> 00:27:45,583
Huh.

382
00:27:47,961 --> 00:27:50,713
Anyway, I don't know why
I'm standing next to my own piece

383
00:27:50,797 --> 00:27:52,674
like some kind of asshole.

384
00:27:52,757 --> 00:27:56,928
- The work speaks for itself.
- Oh, it speaks, all right.

385
00:27:57,971 --> 00:28:00,431
It speaks in didactic knee-jerk clichés

386
00:28:00,515 --> 00:28:03,852
about the ambient violence
of the gentrification cycle.

387
00:28:04,561 --> 00:28:08,731
But your kind are the real pioneers
of that cycle, you know.

388
00:28:08,815 --> 00:28:10,149
Excuse me?

389
00:28:11,401 --> 00:28:12,527
Artists.

390
00:28:14,445 --> 00:28:17,323
Artists descend upon
disenfranchised neighborhoods

391
00:28:17,407 --> 00:28:20,201
divining cheap rent, so they can
dick around in their studios

392
00:28:20,285 --> 00:28:22,662
without the crushing burden of a day job.

393
00:28:24,581 --> 00:28:26,082
I'm gonna get another drink.

394
00:28:35,008 --> 00:28:37,135
- Should we try it?
- What?

395
00:28:37,218 --> 00:28:38,803
Summon the Candyman?

396
00:28:38,887 --> 00:28:42,140
Uh, yeah, no. Black people don't need
to be summoning shit.

397
00:28:42,223 --> 00:28:45,226
- Come on, that is nonsense.
- This isn't the bayou.

398
00:28:45,310 --> 00:28:47,187
In Chicago, that's white people shit.

399
00:28:47,270 --> 00:28:48,563
Mmm.

400
00:28:48,646 --> 00:28:51,900
- Candyman. Candyman.
- Zip it. Hey, stop.

401
00:28:57,655 --> 00:28:58,865
- Candyman.
- Stop it.

402
00:29:04,204 --> 00:29:06,372
[man] Of course, I did. I owe Brianna one.

403
00:29:06,456 --> 00:29:09,667
She introduced me to Thelma Golden
three years ago.

404
00:29:09,751 --> 00:29:12,212
- [Brianna] You still owe me one for that.
- [laughs]

405
00:29:12,295 --> 00:29:13,588
And, uh…

406
00:29:13,671 --> 00:29:14,881
Ah… [snaps fingers]

407
00:29:14,964 --> 00:29:16,382
Tony, is it?

408
00:29:16,466 --> 00:29:19,219
I love interventionist strategy.

409
00:29:19,302 --> 00:29:22,305
Conventional painting is such a drag.

410
00:29:22,388 --> 00:29:24,057
I love that you hid those fucking things

411
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:26,351
in a storage room
with the lights out. So smart.

412
00:29:26,434 --> 00:29:28,603
Is all your work based on found material?

413
00:29:28,686 --> 00:29:30,647
I mean, where'd you
even find those paintings?

414
00:29:30,730 --> 00:29:32,023
Thrift store in the desert?

415
00:29:32,106 --> 00:29:33,525
[laughing]

416
00:29:33,608 --> 00:29:36,528
I found them in the studio
where I painted them.

417
00:29:36,611 --> 00:29:37,737
[laughing]

418
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:39,572
You goofy-ass fuck.

419
00:29:40,990 --> 00:29:43,243
And you, you fucking hyenas.

420
00:29:43,326 --> 00:29:45,453
- Oh, what the fuck?
- Hey. Let's go. Clive.

421
00:29:47,121 --> 00:29:48,915
- Anthony.
- You think you'd even be here

422
00:29:48,998 --> 00:29:50,083
if it wasn't for her?

423
00:29:50,166 --> 00:29:52,168
Shouldn't you be stocking up
on morning-after pills

424
00:29:52,252 --> 00:29:54,045
to accommodate your summer intern program?

425
00:29:54,128 --> 00:29:56,923
That's not spontaneous.
You had that one in the bank.

426
00:29:57,006 --> 00:29:58,675
Yeah, I did, bitch.

427
00:29:58,758 --> 00:29:59,926
[grunts]

428
00:30:00,677 --> 00:30:03,137
That's fine.
I can take being called a bitch.

429
00:30:03,847 --> 00:30:06,516
- It's fine. I'm on a NuvaRing.
- [stammering] I know.

430
00:30:08,142 --> 00:30:09,435
Thanks for coming.

431
00:30:35,461 --> 00:30:37,547
I'm so fucking over it.

432
00:30:37,630 --> 00:30:40,216
Honestly, if she can't control her man…

433
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:41,593
[woman] She lost control.

434
00:30:41,676 --> 00:30:44,387
It's like, do I get a thank you? No!

435
00:30:44,470 --> 00:30:47,307
Do I get an apology for that display?

436
00:30:47,390 --> 00:30:49,267
Atrocity exhibition.

437
00:30:50,101 --> 00:30:54,772
[Clive] Shoehorning her boyfriend
into my summer show was her first mistake.

438
00:30:54,856 --> 00:30:56,941
- Only mistake.
- [sighs] She's done.

439
00:30:57,025 --> 00:30:59,152
And she has no one to blame but herself.

440
00:30:59,235 --> 00:31:02,071
Don't mix curation
with who you're fucking.

441
00:31:02,155 --> 00:31:03,281
[woman laughs]

442
00:31:03,364 --> 00:31:04,782
Love will tear us apart.

443
00:31:04,866 --> 00:31:07,327
Jesus, Jerrica, we get it.
You like Joy Division.

444
00:31:07,410 --> 00:31:08,912
- [Jerrica laughs]
- [Clive sighs]

445
00:31:13,416 --> 00:31:16,002
- What's that thing again?
- [sighs] What thing?

446
00:31:17,545 --> 00:31:18,546
You know.

447
00:31:19,672 --> 00:31:21,716
Say what five times in the mirror?

448
00:31:21,799 --> 00:31:23,968
[sighs] You tell me.

449
00:31:24,052 --> 00:31:26,387
You proofread the press release, Jerrica.

450
00:31:27,514 --> 00:31:28,681
[Clive] "Candyman."

451
00:31:29,974 --> 00:31:33,269
But don't do it, okay?

452
00:31:34,187 --> 00:31:35,939
I don't want you to die tonight.

453
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:39,651
At least, not until we…

454
00:31:40,401 --> 00:31:41,444
fuck.

455
00:31:43,363 --> 00:31:44,614
You're no good for me.

456
00:31:44,697 --> 00:31:46,950
You know what? I changed my mind. Do it.

457
00:31:47,033 --> 00:31:48,826
Necrophilia's always been
on my bucket list.

458
00:31:48,910 --> 00:31:50,078
Mmm.

459
00:31:52,413 --> 00:31:54,040
- [shoes clatter]
- [Clive] Mmm.

460
00:31:55,583 --> 00:31:56,668
Hmm.

461
00:31:56,751 --> 00:31:58,044
Let's do it here then.

462
00:31:58,670 --> 00:31:59,712
Um.

463
00:31:59,796 --> 00:32:02,298
- No, I've been here all day.
- Come on.

464
00:32:04,050 --> 00:32:05,385
[rain pattering]

465
00:32:09,973 --> 00:32:11,683
- [Clive] Mmm.
- [giggles]

466
00:32:12,892 --> 00:32:15,937
- [Jerrica] Candyman.
- Are you serious?

467
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:17,188
Quiet, bitch.

468
00:32:25,029 --> 00:32:26,489
- Candyman.
- [Clive groans]

469
00:32:27,156 --> 00:32:28,658
Candyman.

470
00:32:28,741 --> 00:32:30,243
[bee buzzing]

471
00:32:31,494 --> 00:32:33,288
- Candyman.
- Mmm.

472
00:32:33,371 --> 00:32:34,706
Candyman.

473
00:32:52,223 --> 00:32:53,308
[Jerrica] <i>See?</i>

474
00:32:53,391 --> 00:32:54,976
Nothing.

475
00:32:55,059 --> 00:32:56,811
So much for that.

476
00:32:57,437 --> 00:32:58,605
[kisses]

477
00:32:59,189 --> 00:33:00,690
- [slashing]
- [Jerrica grunts]

478
00:33:03,693 --> 00:33:04,694
[Clive grunts]

479
00:33:04,777 --> 00:33:05,862
[blood splattering]

480
00:33:05,945 --> 00:33:06,946
[Clive] Is this real?

481

00:44:22,705 --> 00:44:24,707
I'm expanding the work into a series.

645
00:44:26,376 --> 00:44:28,545
I'm hoping to do a solo show.

646
00:44:29,712 --> 00:44:31,714
All about Candyman. Spread the word.

647
00:44:31,798 --> 00:44:33,591
Mmm, I love that idea.

648
00:44:34,592 --> 00:44:39,264
I'm surprised at how positive
your take on my piece seems to be now.

649
00:44:40,265 --> 00:44:41,975
Well, it grew on me.

650
00:44:42,058 --> 00:44:44,686
- Seemed like you didn't quite get it.
- No, I get it.

651
00:44:44,769 --> 00:44:48,273
It's the hood, gentrification, et cetera.

652
00:44:48,356 --> 00:44:50,692
Artists gentrify the hood?

653
00:44:52,110 --> 00:44:53,987
Who do you think makes the hood?

654
00:44:55,613 --> 00:44:59,450
The city cuts off a community
and waits for it to die.

655
00:45:00,827 --> 00:45:02,996
Then they invite developers in

656
00:45:03,079 --> 00:45:05,415
and say, "Hey, you artists,

657
00:45:05,498 --> 00:45:08,710
you young people, you white,
preferably or only…

658
00:45:10,044 --> 00:45:12,505
please come to the hood, it's cheap.

659
00:45:12,589 --> 00:45:16,384
And if you stick it out for a couple
of years, we'll bring you a Whole Foods."

660
00:45:17,719 --> 00:45:19,929
You wanna be a part of the story, right?

661
00:45:20,013 --> 00:45:21,556
Well, as a critic, I…

662
00:45:21,639 --> 00:45:23,975
To really engage with the work,

663
00:45:24,058 --> 00:45:25,393
to "get it"…

664
00:45:27,937 --> 00:45:29,022
you should say it.

665
00:45:29,105 --> 00:45:30,732
- Say what?
- Say his name.

666
00:45:30,815 --> 00:45:32,108
[laughs]

667
00:45:36,571 --> 00:45:38,198
Think I need to use the bathroom.

668
00:45:38,281 --> 00:45:40,033
Oh, this is as good a time as any.

669
00:45:41,534 --> 00:45:42,785
I dare you.

670
00:45:56,633 --> 00:45:58,218
[sighs]

671
00:45:59,219 --> 00:46:00,595
[clears throat]

672
00:46:15,235 --> 00:46:18,613
[man on PA system] <i>Doors open
to the right at State and Lake.</i>

673
00:46:18,696 --> 00:46:21,741
<i>Transfer to Red Line trains
at State and Lake.</i>

674
00:46:29,874 --> 00:46:31,835
[tense music playing]

675
00:47:02,198 --> 00:47:03,491
Ah!

676
00:47:16,129 --> 00:47:17,714
[knocks] Finley?

677
00:47:50,747 --> 00:47:51,831
[shouts]

678
00:47:52,373 --> 00:47:53,708
[raspy breathing]

679
00:48:11,809 --> 00:48:13,102
[raspy breathing continues]

680
00:48:39,337 --> 00:48:41,256
[bees buzzing]

681
00:48:54,602 --> 00:48:55,770
Are you all right?

682
00:49:03,695 --> 00:49:05,196
- I thought…
- What?

683
00:49:14,038 --> 00:49:15,248
I gotta go.

684
00:49:30,680 --> 00:49:31,806
[thud]

685
00:49:38,396 --> 00:49:40,064
[police siren wailing]

686
00:49:43,651 --> 00:49:45,612
[distorted dialogue]

687
00:49:45,695 --> 00:49:49,199
[man, muffled] Really?
No one's buying it, not that I care.

688
00:49:57,165 --> 00:49:58,416
Careful.

689
00:49:59,667 --> 00:50:04,589
I love being here.
It's so provincial, yet exciting.

690
00:50:05,715 --> 00:50:08,134
Oh, my God.
Have you met Danielle Harrington?

691
00:50:08,218 --> 00:50:10,845
- She's chief...
- Curator at the MCA.

692
00:50:10,929 --> 00:50:13,306
I find it crazy that
we actually haven't met yet.

693
00:50:13,389 --> 00:50:14,891
I've been so eager to meet you.

694
00:50:14,974 --> 00:50:17,560
Don't you start already. I get first dibs.

695
00:50:17,644 --> 00:50:21,773
Clive literally had to die
for Brianna to be free. Sorry.

696
00:50:21,856 --> 00:50:24,400
Jameson's doing a show
at my gallery in New York.

697
00:50:25,068 --> 00:50:27,987
I think it's
the perfect opportunity for you

698
00:50:28,071 --> 00:50:29,614
to spread your wings a bit more.

699
00:50:29,697 --> 00:50:31,032
Come to the big city.

700
00:50:31,115 --> 00:50:32,992
I could introduce you to
the women of Entre Nous

701
00:50:33,076 --> 00:50:34,160
if you decide on New York.

702
00:50:34,244 --> 00:50:36,663
Wow. Thank you.

703
00:50:36,746 --> 00:50:39,874
I've actually been considering
going out on my own.

704
00:50:39,958 --> 00:50:42,085
Don't you wanna focus
on working with artists

705
00:50:42,168 --> 00:50:45,088
instead of chasing outstanding invoices?

706
00:50:45,171 --> 00:50:48,591
You can change the institution
from the inside.

707
00:50:49,759 --> 00:50:51,427
You should come by the museum some time.

708
00:50:51,511 --> 00:50:53,429
Okay.

709
00:50:53,513 --> 00:50:55,014
- I think I'd like that.
- [phone buzzing]

710
00:50:55,098 --> 00:50:56,391
- [Jameson] Oh, my God.
- [phones chiming]

711
00:50:56,474 --> 00:50:57,559
- What's wrong?
- What's happening?

712
00:50:57,642 --> 00:51:00,228
Finley Stephens was found dead
in her apartment.

713
00:51:00,311 --> 00:51:01,980
[Danielle] Her husband found her.

714
00:51:02,063 --> 00:51:04,816
Poor thing. Oh, her husband's a suspect.

715
00:51:06,192 --> 00:51:08,653
- I have to go.
- Anthony.

716
00:51:08,736 --> 00:51:10,029
[gasps]

717
00:51:30,967 --> 00:51:32,093
Anthony?

718
00:51:32,177 --> 00:51:33,803
[Anthony] <i>What is he?</i>

719
00:51:33,887 --> 00:51:35,638
[William] <i>Candyman ain't a he.</i>

720
00:51:35,722 --> 00:51:37,974
<i>Candyman's the whole damn hive.</i>

721
00:51:39,392 --> 00:51:40,518
There are others?

722
00:51:42,061 --> 00:51:43,354
[William] <i>Samuel Evans.</i>

723
00:51:44,105 --> 00:51:47,692
<i>Run down during
the white housing riots of the '50s.</i>

724
00:51:47,775 --> 00:51:50,820
<i>William Bell, lynched in the '20s.</i>

725
00:51:51,738 --> 00:51:54,782
<i>But the first one, where it all began,</i>

726
00:51:54,866 --> 00:51:57,118
<i>was in the 1890s.</i>

727
00:51:57,202 --> 00:52:00,747
<i>It's a story Helen found.
The story of Daniel Robitaille.</i>

728
00:52:01,789 --> 00:52:06,044
<i>He'd made a living touring the country
painting portraits for wealthy families.</i>

729
00:52:06,127 --> 00:52:09,047
<i>Mostly white, and they loved him.</i>

730
00:52:09,839 --> 00:52:11,174
But you know how it goes.

731
00:52:12,759 --> 00:52:14,844
They love what we make

732
00:52:14,928 --> 00:52:16,012
but not us.

733
00:52:18,306 --> 00:52:20,183
<i>One day, he's commissioned</i>

734
00:52:20,266 --> 00:52:22,393
<i>to paint the daughter
of a Chicago factory owner</i>

735
00:52:22,477 --> 00:52:24,646
<i>who made his fortune in the stockyards.</i>

736
00:52:24,729 --> 00:52:25,730
<i>Well,</i>

737
00:52:25,813 --> 00:52:29,192
<i>Robitaille committed
the ultimate sin of his time.</i>

738
00:52:29,984 --> 00:52:31,736
They fell in love.

739
00:52:31,819 --> 00:52:34,072
They had an affair, she got pregnant.

740
00:52:34,155 --> 00:52:36,282
<i>The girl tells her father, and, well…</i>

741
00:52:36,366 --> 00:52:37,367
<i>you know…</i>

742
00:52:37,450 --> 00:52:40,161
<i>He hires some men to hunt Robitaille down,</i>

743
00:52:40,245 --> 00:52:41,663
<i>told them to get creative.</i>

744
00:52:42,497 --> 00:52:44,582
Chased him through here
in the middle of the day.

745
00:52:44,666 --> 00:52:45,792
He collapses from exhaustion

746
00:52:45,875 --> 00:52:48,545
right near where the old tower
in Chestnut used to be.

747
00:52:48,628 --> 00:52:51,130
<i>They beat him. Tortured him.</i>

748
00:52:51,214 --> 00:52:54,884
<i>They cut off his arm
and jammed a meat hook in the stump.</i>

749
00:52:54,968 --> 00:52:58,012
They smeared honeycomb
from the nearby hives on his chest

750
00:52:58,096 --> 00:52:59,389
and let the bees sting him.

751
00:52:59,472 --> 00:53:02,183
<i>A crowd started to form to watch the show.</i>

752
00:53:03,393 --> 00:53:04,936
<i>The big finale:</i>

753
00:53:05,019 --> 00:53:07,564
They set him on fire

754
00:53:07,647 --> 00:53:09,357
and he finally dies.

755
00:53:11,234 --> 00:53:13,194
But a story like that,

756
00:53:13,278 --> 00:53:14,571
a pain like that…

757
00:53:16,197 --> 00:53:17,615
lasts forever.

758
00:53:19,909 --> 00:53:21,202
That's Candyman.

759
00:53:26,374 --> 00:53:27,375
So…

760
00:53:29,502 --> 00:53:30,628
he's real?

761
00:53:30,712 --> 00:53:31,880
Bell is real.

762
00:53:31,963 --> 00:53:35,758
Samuel, Sherman, Daniel Robitaille.
They're all real.

763
00:53:36,593 --> 00:53:39,721
Candyman is how we deal with the fact
that these things happened.

764
00:53:39,804 --> 00:53:41,514
That they're still happening.

765
00:53:44,726 --> 00:53:46,060
Get some rest, young blood.

766
00:53:47,478 --> 00:53:49,022
You'll feel better in the morning.

767
00:54:06,039 --> 00:54:07,457
[Anthony] Don't look at those!

768
00:54:08,917 --> 00:54:10,376
What the fuck is this?

769
00:54:11,127 --> 00:54:12,795
You shouldn't be looking at this.

770
00:54:14,756 --> 00:54:17,842
Anthony, we are beyond
sensitive artist bullshit.

771
00:54:17,926 --> 00:54:20,136
What is going on?

772
00:54:21,137 --> 00:54:22,931
I think... I think…

773
00:54:24,933 --> 00:54:27,727
- I made a mistake, Bri.
- What do you mean?

774
00:54:29,437 --> 00:54:31,314
- I brought him back.
- Who?

775
00:54:32,732 --> 00:54:34,400
You promise you won't think I'm crazy?

776
00:54:34,484 --> 00:54:35,902
Anthony, who?

777
00:54:39,989 --> 00:54:41,241
Oh, God.

778
00:54:42,367 --> 00:54:44,827
- Burke told me…
- God. Who is Burke?

779
00:54:44,911 --> 00:54:46,704
From the laundromat.
He knows about all of it.

780
00:54:46,788 --> 00:54:47,956
Knows about what?

781
00:54:49,541 --> 00:54:50,583
Candyman.

782
00:54:52,252 --> 00:54:54,462
- Candyman isn't real.
- I saw him!

783
00:54:54,546 --> 00:54:57,590
Candyman isn't real, Anthony!

784
00:54:59,133 --> 00:55:01,427
You know what is real?

785
00:55:01,511 --> 00:55:05,598
Me, Anthony. Me. This, this is real.

786
00:55:07,183 --> 00:55:09,060
- You don't understand.
- Okay.

787
00:55:09,143 --> 00:55:12,897
I will show you that... Okay.

788
00:55:12,981 --> 00:55:14,941
- Candyman.
- No!

789
00:55:15,024 --> 00:55:16,025
Candyman!

790
00:55:16,109 --> 00:55:17,151
[screams]

791
00:55:18,987 --> 00:55:19,988
[screams]

792
00:55:21,239 --> 00:55:23,992
Don't… say his name.

793
00:55:24,075 --> 00:55:26,035
- You stay the fuck right there.
- Brianna…

794
00:55:26,119 --> 00:55:28,246
Don't follow me.

795
00:55:35,837 --> 00:55:39,340
[Troy] Mm-mmm. Mm-mmm.
Let the motherfucker try and come up here.

796
00:55:39,424 --> 00:55:44,137
Fucking art ogre, fucking fee-fi-fo-fum.
Grady will stomp on his ass.

797
00:55:44,220 --> 00:55:46,973
- Ain't that right, Grady?
- If I have to stomp, I'll stomp.

798
00:55:47,056 --> 00:55:49,267
I mean, he literally was, like,

799
00:55:49,350 --> 00:55:52,395
"I summoned Candyman," and I'm like…

800
00:55:52,478 --> 00:55:54,105
Candyman ain't real, nigga.

801
00:55:54,189 --> 00:55:57,442
I told you not to start dating
that Dapper Dan-ass,

802
00:55:57,525 --> 00:56:00,778
li'l Basquiat-ass, fucking no-job Sun Ra...

803
00:56:00,862 --> 00:56:02,405
Troy. Okay.

804
00:56:02,488 --> 00:56:05,283
Ain't a dick on the planet good enough
to offset a demonology hobby.

805
00:56:05,366 --> 00:56:06,910
Okay, Troy, stop!

806
00:56:06,993 --> 00:56:09,204
What? It's the truth.
If Grady came up in here,

807
00:56:09,287 --> 00:56:11,122
smashing mirrors.

808
00:56:12,790 --> 00:56:13,791
Mirrors.

809
00:56:15,335 --> 00:56:16,336
He's right.

810
00:56:19,589 --> 00:56:21,090
- All right.
- You…

811
00:56:22,133 --> 00:56:24,219
take care of Lucy.

812
00:56:24,302 --> 00:56:26,596
And you are in time-out.

813
00:56:26,679 --> 00:56:27,805
Come here.

814
00:56:29,307 --> 00:56:30,517
Break it up.

815
00:56:35,813 --> 00:56:38,024
I spoke to Mom.

816
00:56:38,983 --> 00:56:41,402
She wants to close the storage unit out,

817
00:56:41,486 --> 00:56:44,364
so we finally have to deal
with Dad's work.

818
00:56:44,447 --> 00:56:46,366
I was thinking maybe we could

819
00:56:47,575 --> 00:56:48,952
sell or…

820
00:56:50,537 --> 00:56:54,541
- if you want to keep anything…
- No, I don't want any of that in my house.

821
00:56:54,624 --> 00:56:57,126
- Thank you.
- Then, sell or do a show.

822
00:56:57,210 --> 00:56:58,753
I think you should open a space.

823
00:56:58,837 --> 00:57:02,674
I'm not doing a show
of the thing that killed him, Troy.

824
00:57:02,757 --> 00:57:04,968
You can't hide everything, and…

825
00:57:05,051 --> 00:57:06,845
- and just hope it goes away.
- Troy…

826
00:57:06,928 --> 00:57:10,056
You don't have to be there every time
a tortured artist has a psychotic break.

827
00:57:15,728 --> 00:57:16,771
I'm sorry.

828
00:57:16,855 --> 00:57:17,897
[scoffs]

829
00:57:19,023 --> 00:57:20,358
Bri.

830
00:57:26,030 --> 00:57:27,740
I'm glad you're here.

831
00:57:29,826 --> 00:57:32,412
You can stay as long as you want,
on the condition you don't try

832
00:57:32,495 --> 00:57:33,913
and summon Candyman.

833
00:57:35,081 --> 00:57:36,791
Who would do that?

834
00:57:36,875 --> 00:57:38,835
- [bell ringing]
- What's up?

835
00:57:40,670 --> 00:57:43,214
[laughing, chattering]

836
00:57:46,384 --> 00:57:48,970
[girl] Trina was fooked up this weekend.

837
00:57:49,053 --> 00:57:52,223
- Guys, what should I do about my bangs?
- No one cares about your bangs.

838
00:57:52,307 --> 00:57:53,600
Annika, look at this.

839
00:57:53,683 --> 00:57:56,728
Trina's fucking trashed. Look.
Watch, watch, watch.

840
00:57:56,811 --> 00:57:59,439
- Samantha.
- Oh, my God, that's so sad.

841
00:58:00,148 --> 00:58:03,443
- [gasps] Oh, shit.
- Look at this chunky-ass vomit.

842
00:58:03,526 --> 00:58:05,904
Oh, my gosh, in front of everyone.

843
00:58:05,987 --> 00:58:07,780
Have you guys heard of Candyman?

844
00:58:09,240 --> 00:58:11,367
Fuck this. I changed my mind.
I'm not gonna do it.

845
00:58:11,451 --> 00:58:15,371
- Come on, Boof. Don't be a pussy.
- Why not? It's a warm and wonderful thing.

846
00:58:15,455 --> 00:58:16,956
Boof, we're already in formation.

847
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:18,583
- Fine.
- Okay, ready?

848
00:58:18,666 --> 00:58:20,376
Candyman.

849
00:58:20,460 --> 00:58:21,961
All at once, dumbass.

850
00:58:25,548 --> 00:58:26,674
[all] Candyman.

851
00:58:28,218 --> 00:58:29,469
Candyman.

852
00:58:31,262 --> 00:58:32,472
Candyman.

853
00:58:35,099 --> 00:58:36,893
- Not today. Not today.
- Come on.

854
00:58:36,976 --> 00:58:38,686
[Haley] Two more times.

855
00:58:43,608 --> 00:58:45,151
[all] Candyman.

856
00:58:45,235 --> 00:58:46,361
One more.

857
00:58:48,530 --> 00:58:50,031
Candyman.

858
00:58:52,534 --> 00:58:55,119
Well, we're still alive, so…

859
00:58:59,290 --> 00:59:00,750
Hey, Trina.

860
00:59:01,960 --> 00:59:03,169
[Haley] Let's go.

861
00:59:08,132 --> 00:59:11,803
Hey, Triney, how's that hangover?
You're such a mess.

862
00:59:11,886 --> 00:59:13,221
[girls laughing]

863
00:59:13,304 --> 00:59:15,306
[banging]

864
00:59:15,390 --> 00:59:18,852
- Trina was fucking trashed.
- Don't let her drink that much.

865
00:59:18,935 --> 00:59:20,353
That's between her and her god.

866
00:59:21,187 --> 00:59:23,147
Trina, you broke the fucking door.

867
00:59:23,231 --> 00:59:25,733
[music on headphones]

868
00:59:27,068 --> 00:59:28,778
Haley, I'm too young to die. Open it.

869
00:59:28,862 --> 00:59:30,530
- I'm working on it.
- [bees buzzing]

870
00:59:30,613 --> 00:59:32,490
[raspy breathing]

871
00:59:35,326 --> 00:59:36,327
Guys…

872
00:59:36,411 --> 00:59:37,662
What the fuck?

873
00:59:37,745 --> 00:59:40,039
- Wait, I forgot my vape.
- Boof.

874
00:59:40,123 --> 00:59:42,750
You know, I don't think you should…

875
00:59:42,834 --> 00:59:44,210
- Boof?
- [thuds]

876
00:59:45,003 --> 00:59:46,004
Boof?

877
00:59:46,087 --> 00:59:47,297
[cracking]

878
00:59:47,380 --> 00:59:48,756
Boof?

879
00:59:50,925 --> 00:59:51,926
What are you doing?

880
00:59:52,010 --> 00:59:53,928
[cracking, crunching continues]

[gasps]

884
01:00:05,857 --> 01:00:09,027
- Oh, my God, guys. Stop being so stupid!
- Haley!

885
01:00:09,110 --> 01:00:10,320
[muffled shouting]

886
01:00:10,403 --> 01:00:11,946

- This isn't funny.
- [screaming continues]

893
01:00:28,087 --> 01:00:30,590
[Trina] You guys, what the fuck?
This isn't funny!

894
01:00:30,673 --> 01:00:31,674

[Haley screaming]

01:00:52,111 --> 01:00:54,030
[Haley] No!

01:00:54,113 --> 01:00:55,949
[hook slashes]

902
01:01:10,463 --> 01:01:11,923

[gasping]

910
01:02:05,059 --> 01:02:07,145
[Danielle] We've been trying to move
in a fresher direction

911
01:02:07,228 --> 01:02:08,563
for the past few years,

912
01:02:08,646 --> 01:02:12,775
and our last curator was a great guy,
but just had a hard time getting there.

913
01:02:12,859 --> 01:02:15,695
[Brianna] Well, I've certainly noticed
a shift in programming

914
01:02:15,778 --> 01:02:18,615
- since you started here.
- Hopefully for the best.

915
01:02:19,115 --> 01:02:21,784
I'm so happy I finally got
to meet you at Jack's dinner.

916
01:02:21,868 --> 01:02:24,495
Yes. He's been trying
to get us together before.

917
01:02:24,579 --> 01:02:27,665
It's crazy about Clive.

918
01:02:27,749 --> 01:02:30,210
I heard you were the one
to find the bodies.

919
01:02:30,293 --> 01:02:31,628
Yeah…

920
01:02:31,711 --> 01:02:32,795
[guide speaking, indistinct]

921
01:02:32,879 --> 01:02:34,797
You've really emerged

922
01:02:34,881 --> 01:02:38,593
as an interesting figure amidst all this.

923
01:02:38,676 --> 01:02:41,346
The show you put together
sounded so good too.

924
01:02:41,429 --> 01:02:44,641
You were so brave to embrace formlessness.

925
01:02:44,724 --> 01:02:49,145
Actually, there were a lot of bodies...
figures in the show.

926
01:02:49,229 --> 01:02:50,855
Like Arnold's work.

927
01:02:50,939 --> 01:02:56,236
For so long, abstraction has been about
indexing a sublimated emotional state,

928
01:02:56,319 --> 01:02:59,239
- and I just wanted to focus on the body.
- Of course, but I mean,

929
01:02:59,322 --> 01:03:02,200
between the recent tragedies
and your father's legacy,

930
01:03:02,283 --> 01:03:04,702
you've got a fascinating story.

931
01:03:05,620 --> 01:03:07,247
Right.

932
01:03:07,330 --> 01:03:09,707
And your eye for emerging talent.

933
01:03:09,791 --> 01:03:12,126
How long have you worked
with Anthony McCoy?

934
01:03:13,044 --> 01:03:14,838
Just a couple years.

935
01:03:14,921 --> 01:03:18,842
My board members are buzzing
about McCoy's work.

936
01:03:18,925 --> 01:03:23,346
Feels like a Project Room show
is something we could start talking about.

937
01:03:24,639 --> 01:03:27,433
And of course, any other artist
you have your eye on.

938
01:03:33,982 --> 01:03:37,277
[reporter on TV] <i>The Near North Side

943
01:03:50,540 --> 01:03:52,667
[doctor] Welcome back, Mr. McCoy.

944
01:03:52,750 --> 01:03:54,002
What?

945
01:03:54,544 --> 01:03:56,671
I saw in your file you were born here.

946
01:03:59,340 --> 01:04:01,176
I was born on the South Side.

947
01:04:02,844 --> 01:04:04,721
No, it says you were born here.

948
01:04:05,180 --> 01:04:06,514
[voices whispering]

949
01:04:06,598 --> 01:04:09,142
Regardless, it's good that
you came in when you did.

950
01:04:09,225 --> 01:04:12,729
We need to admit you immediately
for monitoring and do some more testing.

951
01:04:14,147 --> 01:04:16,149

[door opens, creaks]

954
01:04:44,052 --> 01:04:46,304
Anthony, where have you been?

955
01:04:54,437 --> 01:04:55,855
What happened to your hand?

956
01:04:56,648 --> 01:04:58,274
Looks bad.

957
01:05:00,026 --> 01:05:03,071
Went to River North Memorial,
near Cabrini.

958
01:05:05,073 --> 01:05:06,908
They fixed me right up.

959
01:05:09,452 --> 01:05:10,745
You've been painting?

960
01:05:11,704 --> 01:05:13,540
[chuckles]

961
01:05:13,623 --> 01:05:17,585
Yeah, I've been inspired a lot, actually,

962
01:05:17,669 --> 01:05:19,462
by Cabrini.

963
01:05:20,505 --> 01:05:22,423
[sniffs] You want some tea?

964
01:05:22,507 --> 01:05:24,551
I heard a story about a fire.

965
01:05:25,343 --> 01:05:27,387
Killed a woman named Helen Lyle.

966
01:05:28,721 --> 01:05:30,348
A baby that was taken.

967
01:05:31,224 --> 01:05:33,393
Something they used to call Candyman.

968
01:05:33,476 --> 01:05:35,061
[shushes]

969
01:05:35,937 --> 01:05:37,647
Don't.

970
01:05:37,730 --> 01:05:39,148
Don't say that.

971
01:05:43,236 --> 01:05:46,030
You told me I was born on the South Side.

972
01:05:46,114 --> 01:05:48,408
I did raise you in the home you remember.

973
01:05:50,618 --> 01:05:54,122
But you were born in River North Memorial

974
01:05:54,205 --> 01:05:56,916
and spent the first two years in Cabrini.

975
01:05:58,126 --> 01:05:59,752
Why did you lie?

976
01:06:01,588 --> 01:06:03,006
To protect you.

977
01:06:08,011 --> 01:06:09,137
From what?

978
01:06:12,557 --> 01:06:17,604
I just wanted you to grow up happy

979
01:06:17,687 --> 01:06:19,230
and normal.

980
01:06:25,528 --> 01:06:27,155
Do I look normal, Mama?

981
01:06:32,827 --> 01:06:34,746
- [grunts]
- I have to know.

982
01:06:36,456 --> 01:06:37,457
Now.

983
01:06:39,083 --> 01:06:40,335
[sighs]

984
01:06:47,884 --> 01:06:52,305
When you first got taken,
I thought she was the one who did it.

985
01:07:02,232 --> 01:07:03,525
[sobs]

986
01:07:06,236 --> 01:07:10,156
When you first got taken,
I thought she was the one who did it.

987
01:07:11,115 --> 01:07:12,200
Helen.

988
01:07:12,283 --> 01:07:13,743
[fire crackling]

989
01:07:17,038 --> 01:07:19,874
The way I found her in her apartment,

990
01:07:19,958 --> 01:07:21,501
covered in blood.

991
01:07:22,961 --> 01:07:25,004
We all thought she was crazy.

992
01:07:31,177 --> 01:07:32,846
But it wasn't her.

993
01:07:37,141 --> 01:07:38,726
It was him.

994
01:07:38,810 --> 01:07:40,186
[fire crackling]

995
01:07:42,522 --> 01:07:44,440

<i>He chose you to be</i>

998
01:07:48,236 --> 01:07:50,572
one of his victims.

999
01:07:51,573 --> 01:07:54,659
He wanted you to burn in that fire.

1000
01:07:54,742 --> 01:07:57,078
But she pulled you out…

1001
01:07:58,872 --> 01:08:01,124
and gave you back to me.

1002
01:08:02,458 --> 01:08:03,626
[chuckles]

1003
01:08:03,710 --> 01:08:05,712

- [baby crying]

1004

- [Candyman] <i>Wait!</i>

1005
01:08:11,050 --> 01:08:13,803
[Anne-Marie] <i>In the fire.
I thought she ended it.</i>

1006
01:08:16,014 --> 01:08:18,850
And we vowed to never say his name again.

1007
01:08:23,395 --> 01:08:24,898
But…

1008
01:08:25,732 --> 01:08:29,736
someone broke the pact and…

1009
01:08:29,819 --> 01:08:31,069
He found me.

1010
01:08:31,154 --> 01:08:32,529

01:08:38,620 --> 01:08:39,871
I'm sorry.

1014
01:08:45,502 --> 01:08:48,712
Anthony, wait, wait. Baby, wait.

1015
01:08:48,796 --> 01:08:50,548
Where are you going?

1016
01:08:50,631 --> 01:08:53,343
Anthony, baby, wait, wait, wait.

1017

Anthony?

1021
01:09:48,648 --> 01:09:49,858
It is Troy.

1022
01:09:50,942 --> 01:09:55,321
Come out immediately where I can see you.

1023
01:09:55,405 --> 01:09:58,783
- Immediately.
- Troy, stop. Please, oh, my gosh.

1024
01:09:58,867 --> 01:10:02,412
We are picking up her things

1025
01:10:02,495 --> 01:10:03,997
and we will…

1026
01:10:05,373 --> 01:10:07,542
be leaving with them.

1027
01:10:07,625 --> 01:10:09,419
I see. Yeah, thanks.

1028
01:10:10,253 --> 01:10:11,838
He's not with Noah either.

1029
01:10:12,881 --> 01:10:14,424
What the hell is going on?

1030
01:10:14,507 --> 01:10:17,886
- Maybe Candyman got his ass.
- That's not funny, Troy.

1031
01:10:57,550 --> 01:10:58,885
Hello?

1032
01:11:07,435 --> 01:11:08,645
[door lock clicks]

Anthony?

[doorknob rattles]

1035
01:11:30,708 --> 01:11:32,252
Nope.

1036
01:11:46,933 --> 01:11:49,853
Hello! Excuse me!

1037
01:11:49,936 --> 01:11:51,479
Please!

- [boy] I wanna play.
- [girl] No.

1042
01:12:10,039 --> 01:12:12,792
- [boy] Please. I'm not scared anymore.
- [girl] Go play with your puppets.

1043
01:12:12,876 --> 01:12:15,420
[boy] I'm gonna pee on your bed
if you don't let me in.

1044
01:12:15,503 --> 01:12:17,297
[girl] You're being so annoying right now.

1045
01:12:17,380 --> 01:12:20,049
- What are you doing?
- [girl] Mind your business.

1046
01:12:20,133 --> 01:12:22,510
Come on, let me play. Please.

1047
01:12:22,594 --> 01:12:25,680
[girl] This game is for grown-ups,
and you're a big baby.

1048
01:12:25,763 --> 01:12:27,265
[Billy] I'm not a baby.

1049
01:12:27,348 --> 01:12:28,641
Go away!

[sighs]

[girl 2] No, this is not gonna work.

Candyman.

Candyman.

Candyman.

[muffled thudding]

1059
01:12:52,832 --> 01:12:53,917

Now…

1068
01:13:24,572 --> 01:13:25,949
we have a witness.

1069
01:13:33,039 --> 01:13:35,124
[man] I think I saw the guy
you're looking for.

1070
01:13:35,208 --> 01:13:36,835
The "Say My Name" killer.

1071
01:13:36,918 --> 01:13:39,462
He's roaming around
the row houses at Cabrini.

1072
01:13:39,546 --> 01:13:41,089
A Black man, around 30.

1073
01:13:41,172 --> 01:13:45,093
He was waving a hook and talking crazy.
I think he's killing people down there!

[chair rattles]

- What the fuck?
- [phone beeps]

[Brianna] What the fuck?

1077
01:14:01,484 --> 01:14:03,069
I was baptized here.

1078
01:14:05,738 --> 01:14:06,948
Isn't it beautiful?

1079
01:14:07,031 --> 01:14:11,035
- A... A... A... Anthony?
- [voices whispering]

1080
01:14:11,119 --> 01:14:15,290
Oh, uh... Yeah, I guess I'm on
some other shit now, huh?

1081
01:14:15,373 --> 01:14:17,166
[Brianna whimpering]

1082
01:14:17,250 --> 01:14:19,544
[William] When something leaves a stain,

1083
01:14:19,627 --> 01:14:22,130
even if you wash it out,

1084
01:14:22,213 --> 01:14:23,214
it's still there.

1085
01:14:24,465 --> 01:14:25,675
You can feel it.

1086
01:14:26,634 --> 01:14:29,220
A thinning, deep in the fabric.

1087
01:14:31,681 --> 01:14:34,559
This neighborhood got caught in a loop.

1088
01:14:34,642 --> 01:14:38,479
The shit got stained
in the exact same spot,

1089
01:14:38,563 --> 01:14:40,231
over and over,

1090
01:14:40,315 --> 01:14:42,942
until it finally rotted
from the inside out.

1091
01:14:43,026 --> 01:14:44,110
[gasping]

1092
01:14:44,194 --> 01:14:47,280
[William] They tore down our homes,
so they could move back in.

1093
01:14:47,363 --> 01:14:49,741
We need Candyman.

1094
01:14:50,617 --> 01:14:53,578
'Cause this time,
he'll be killing their fathers,

1095
01:14:54,329 --> 01:14:57,540
their babies, their sisters.

1096
01:14:59,167 --> 01:15:03,963
I knew it was only a matter of time
before the baby came back here,

1097
01:15:04,047 --> 01:15:06,132
in perfect symmetry.

1098
01:15:06,216 --> 01:15:10,803
A chance for Candyman to take back
what's rightfully his.

1099
01:15:10,887 --> 01:15:11,930
[Brianna whimpering]

1100
01:15:12,013 --> 01:15:13,097
His legend.

1101
01:15:20,063 --> 01:15:21,189
Hand.

1102
01:15:22,065 --> 01:15:23,816
Wait…

1103
01:15:23,900 --> 01:15:25,527
[Brianna] No, no, no, no!

1104

[Brianna] Anthony!

1107
01:15:30,114 --> 01:15:32,116
[Brianna sobbing]

1108
01:15:38,373 --> 01:15:41,543
See, you can really make
the story your own.

1109
01:15:42,418 --> 01:15:45,630
But… [grunts] …some of the specifics

1110
01:15:45,713 --> 01:15:47,799
should be somewhat consistent. [grunts]

1111
01:15:47,882 --> 01:15:49,092
[whimpering]

- [William grunts]
- [Anthony groaning]

1114
01:15:59,811 --> 01:16:03,356
Here we have the story of Anthony McCoy,

1115
01:16:03,439 --> 01:16:05,316
artist who lost his mind,

1116
01:16:05,400 --> 01:16:07,861
and the cops showed up
and shot him down in cold blood

1117
01:16:07,944 --> 01:16:09,571
without even saying a word.

1118
01:16:09,654 --> 01:16:11,114
[laughing]

1119
01:16:11,197 --> 01:16:14,450
Well, say his name, if you dare!

1120
01:16:14,534 --> 01:16:17,871
Say it five times in a mirror.
See what happens.

1121
01:16:19,747 --> 01:16:23,293
When it's all done,
they'll tell his story,

1122
01:16:23,376 --> 01:16:25,962
and Candyman will live…

1123

- [sighs]
- [sirens wailing in distance]

[pants]

1126
01:16:31,926 --> 01:16:33,469
Here comes the swarm.

1127
01:16:37,599 --> 01:16:39,225
[William] Are you ready for the sacrament?

1128
