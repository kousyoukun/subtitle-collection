By the father of our lord Jesus Christ I free you from sin.

We now anoint you with the prism of salvation

131
00:14:45,485 --> 00:14:48,626
正如耶稣授于牧师  先知与国王
As Christ was anointed priest, prophet, and king.

132
00:14:48,836 --> 00:14:51,736
愿你永远成为他的子民

以子民的名分
In the spirit of a common sonship,

136
00:15:02,464 --> 00:15:06,306
让我们用主所赐之词祈祷
let us pray together in the words our lord has given us.

137
00:15:06,741 --> 00:15:09,072
我们的天主

138
00:15:09,112 --> 00:15:12,562
愿尔名见圣  愿尔国降临
hallowed be thy name, thy kingdom come

139
00:15:12,932 --> 00:15:16,233

thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.

140

Give us this day, our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses

141
00:15:21,530 --> 00:15:24,840
如同我们宽恕他人的罪
as we forgive those who trespass against us

142
00:15:25,019 --> 00:15:30,088
让我们远离诱惑与邪恶
and lead us not into temptation but delivery us from evil.

143
00:15:30,258 --> 00:15:33,458
愿万能的主  圣父  圣子
The almighty God, the father, the son,

00:15:38,226 --> 00:15:41,056
现在  就让我们欢迎
Now as we receive our new member

146
00:15:41,066 --> 00:15:46,045
这位教会的新成员
into our parish, let us all welcome him with great joy.

147
00:17:24,312 --> 00:17:27,110
你骑得真好
You ride that thing really good.

148
00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:28,500
非常好
Really good.

149
00:17:40,344 --> 00:17:42,434
骑得真不错
You ride good, man.

150
00:17:42,484 --> 00:17:44,774
要我载你回城吗
You like a ride into town?

151
00:17:44,774 --> 00:17:46,679
你可以省点油
Save you some gas, man.

152
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:59,640
你是路过这里吗
Just passing through?

153
00:18:00,030 --> 00:18:01,680
我刚在这落脚
I'm just settling in.

154
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,630
-你住哪儿  -某个该死的汽车旅馆
- Where you staying? - Some fucking motel.

155
00:18:04,690 --> 00:18:07,558
是啊  附近没一家好的
Yeah, they're no good around here.

156
00:18:07,558 --> 00:18:09,148
整个镇子的都烂的像屎一样
Whole towns gone to shit, man.

157
00:18:09,448 --> 00:18:10,778
找到工作了吗
So you got a job?

158
00:18:12,408 --> 00:18:13,258
还没
No.

159
00:18:13,958 --> 00:18:16,047
引擎方面你在行吗
You know your way around an engine?

160
00:18:16,309 --> 00:18:17,016
还行
Yeah.

161
00:18:17,796 --> 00:18:21,976
我有家修理店  在玛莎路
Cause I got a, I got shop. A repair shop on Marsha Road.

162
00:18:23,036 --> 00:18:25,964
来看看吧  我正好缺人手
Come check it out man. I could always use a good worker.

163
00:18:27,124 --> 00:18:28,364
好的
Alright.

164
00:18:29,254 --> 00:18:31,804
不是很大  但
It ain't much. It's...

165
00:18:32,424 --> 00:18:35,251
这是我自己的店
what it is you know. It's mine.

166
00:18:35,421 --> 00:18:37,802
没人能解雇我
No one can kick me out of it.

167
00:18:39,392 --> 00:18:41,712
那是工作车间
So it's a workshop in there.

168
00:18:42,492 --> 00:18:44,312
它叫图尔
This is Tour.

169
00:18:46,334 --> 00:18:48,740
我这的活儿不是很多
I don't get a whole lot of work here you know.

170
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:51,460
但是如果你觉得不够的话
But if you want you can look for other jobs

171
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:53,950
你可以去找别的活儿
or whatever you know if it's not enough for you.

172
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,158
我什么都做
I do everything.

173
00:18:57,158 --> 00:18:59,878
只要是关于汽车的我都能做
Everything there is to do to a car I know how to do.

174
00:19:01,108 --> 00:19:03,868
你不会的我可以教你
Anything you don't know, I can teach you, you know.

175
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:06,259
下面还有一辆房车
And I got a trailer down here.

176
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:08,276
愿意的话就留下来吧
Stay there if you want.

177
00:19:14,302 --> 00:19:16,263
它害羞了
See she's shy.

178
00:19:20,770 --> 00:19:22,090
去哪儿了  球呢
Where is it? Where's the ball?

179
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:24,090
拖车在那儿
There's the trailer.

180
00:19:25,447 --> 00:19:28,468
-它捡到了吗  -它才不会去捡的
- Did she get it? - No, she ain't gonna get it.

181
00:19:28,548 --> 00:19:29,868
你一直一个人住吗
Do you live out here all alone?

182
00:19:29,878 --> 00:19:31,348
是的  一个人住
Yeah, I live alone.

183
00:19:32,198 --> 00:19:35,997
有时候会有人来待一阵
But sometimes people come stay for a while, you know.

184
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:39,226
就这些了  这里虽然小
That's it. It's not much, but you know

185
00:19:39,906 --> 00:19:42,036
但是什么都有
it got whatever you need in there.

186
00:19:51,214 --> 00:19:52,804
你一定很孤单
You must get lonely.

187
00:20:17,788 --> 00:20:20,018
罗伯  不是我不领情
Look, Rob. I don't want to be ungrateful.

188
00:20:20,048 --> 00:20:21,778
我很感激你这么帮我
I really appreciate what you're doing for me and shit,

189
00:20:21,798 --> 00:20:23,778
但是我他妈的需要赚很多钱
but I got to make more fucking money.

190
00:20:24,858 --> 00:20:27,616
老兄  要是能多给你点  我一定给
Hey man, if I could pay you more, I would, you know.

191
00:20:27,656 --> 00:20:30,366
你那么在行  真的太厉害了
Youre good at what you do man. Really good.

192
00:20:31,596 --> 00:20:32,606
我能修好那辆老麦克卡车
I could fix up that old Mack truck

193
00:20:32,606 --> 00:20:34,186
你停在草坪上的当摆设的那辆
that's sitting there like your goddamn lawn ornament.

194
00:20:34,216 --> 00:20:35,683
要是你能修好就太好了
That's good you can go ahead and

195
00:20:35,683 --> 00:20:37,904
但是我没有钱付你
fix it up but I don't have the money to pay you.

196
00:20:39,484 --> 00:20:42,314
你还可以干别的事情
You know, there are other things that can be done, you know.

197
00:20:44,164 --> 00:20:45,671
比如
Like what?

198
00:20:46,487 --> 00:20:48,252
我们可以去抢银行
We could rob a bank.

199
00:20:50,898 --> 00:20:53,278
-尽胡说八道  -我没有胡说八道
- You're full of shit. - I'm not full of shit.

200
00:20:54,498 --> 00:20:57,806
我抢过四次  都是十二年前的事了
I've done it four times myself and stopped twelve years ago.

201
00:20:57,896 --> 00:20:59,656
当时这事可火了
It was getting too hot.

202
00:21:00,946 --> 00:21:04,786
只要别做太多次  就没事
As long as you don't do it too many times, you're fine.

203
00:21:05,823 --> 00:21:09,204
你有孩子吗  你想养他吗
You got a kid? You want to provide for that kid?

204
00:21:09,584 --> 00:21:12,464
你要打败你的对手吗
You want to maybe edge out your competition?

205
00:21:14,464 --> 00:21:17,010
你得利用你的优势
You got to do that using you're skill set.

206
00:21:17,382 --> 00:21:19,352
而你的优势
And your skill set...

207
00:21:21,022 --> 00:21:22,942
很特别
very unique.

208
00:21:25,309 --> 00:21:26,867
你觉得怎么样
What do you say?

209
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,920
-去你妈的  -好吧
- Go fuck yourself. - Okay.

210
00:21:30,570 --> 00:21:34,820
那就用你那微薄的收入去养家吧
Well, good luck supporting your family on minimum wage.

211
00:21:39,938 --> 00:21:41,948
他是我儿子  我要留在他身边
He's my son and I should be around him.

212
00:21:42,358 --> 00:21:45,485
我没有父亲  所以变成现在这样子
I wasn't around my dad and look the fucking way I turned out.

213
00:21:46,521 --> 00:21:48,866
我想照顾你
Look, I wanna take care of you.

214
00:21:50,896 --> 00:21:53,796
我想照顾我儿子  这是我的责任
I want to take care of my son. That's my job.

215
00:21:54,856 --> 00:21:55,894
让我尽我的责任
Let me do my job.

216
00:21:55,985 --> 00:21:57,784
好吧  那你拿什么来照顾我们呢
Okay, how how are you gonna take care of us?

217
00:21:59,054 --> 00:22:01,084
别这样说
Don't say it like that.

218
00:22:01,384 --> 00:22:03,204
-那你怎么照顾我呢  -别
- But how are you gonna take care of me? - Don't...

219
00:22:11,592 --> 00:22:13,602
别挖苦我
Don't talk down to me.

220
00:22:14,832 --> 00:22:17,460
这是一个问题  我没有挖苦你
It's a question. I'm not talking down to you.

221
00:22:18,010 --> 00:22:21,610
-我只是问问  -我会想办法的
- It's just a question. - I'll find... find a way to do it.

222
00:22:22,730 --> 00:22:25,317
你想要房子吗  我会给你房子
You want a house? I'll get you a house.

223
00:22:26,482 --> 00:22:29,618
你想离开这吗  那就走吧
You wanna get the fuck outta here? Get outta here.

224
00:22:29,658 --> 00:22:31,384
我有个房车
I got that trailer.

225
00:22:31,714 --> 00:22:33,854
再弄辆卡车  我们就可以上路了
I'll get a truck. We'll hit the road.

226
00:22:36,869 --> 00:22:38,412
你想去哪儿  我们就在哪儿停
You pick a place you like? We'll stop.

227
00:22:38,432 --> 00:22:40,502
你不想待在这  那我们就离开这里
You don't wanna be there? Fuck you we're outta there.

228
00:22:43,202 --> 00:22:44,262
那我妈妈怎么办
What about my mom?

229
00:22:44,262 --> 00:22:45,719
她可以跟我们一起
She can come.

230
00:22:45,930 --> 00:22:48,600
-科菲呢  -他就不用了
- What about Kofi? - He can stay.

231
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:51,710
他可以再找个女孩  有自己的孩子
He can get his own girl and his own kid.

232
00:22:51,710 --> 00:22:53,190
这是每个人该有的权利
That's every man's right.

233
00:23:00,328 --> 00:23:03,688
-听起来真是个美梦  -罗
- Sounds like a nice dream. - Ro.

234
00:23:40,610 --> 00:23:43,260
如果必要的话  你可以用这个
You can umm... use this if you wanna.

235
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:46,059
但是记住  我抢了四次都没用
But keep in mind that I did four banks with a note.

236
00:23:46,059 --> 00:23:48,238
换句话说  其实你不需要带枪
In other words you don't need the gun.

237
00:23:48,408 --> 00:23:51,178
我不喜欢用枪  他们都是平民百姓
I never liked guns man. They're vulgar.

238
00:23:52,028 --> 00:23:52,898
也许你想带着
But you may want to take it.

239
00:23:52,898 --> 00:23:55,086
不管你想怎么干  我都不会带
I don't... whatever you wanna do.

240
00:23:55,175 --> 00:23:56,309
我们怎么做
How do we do it?

241
00:23:56,369 --> 00:23:59,936
首先  我们一早就要去  穿得像样点
Okay, first thing is we're gonna go in there nice and early.

242
00:23:59,986 --> 00:24:01,366
一开门就要去  明白吗
Just when the doors open okay?

243
00:24:01,376 --> 00:24:03,496
观察所有的柜员
You're gonna take a look at all the tellers...

244
00:24:03,516 --> 00:24:06,720
找一个年纪最大的女人下手
Go for the oldest woman you can alright.

245
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:09,204
没有的话就找一个看起来最温顺的
Failing that, go to the most meek.

246
00:24:09,254 --> 00:24:12,480
让她把钱放在桌子上  为什么呢
Get her to put the money out on the table. Why?

247
00:24:12,910 --> 00:24:15,477
这样你就能知道里面有没有染色包
So that way you can see if there's a dye pack.

248
00:24:12,910 --> 00:24:15,477
染色包  会把钱永久地染成鲜红色  警告人们这些钱是偷来的

249
00:24:15,517 --> 00:24:18,568
把钱装进包里  别留下任何东西
You put it in your pocket. You don't hand anything over to them.

250
00:24:18,618 --> 00:24:21,568
不用掏枪  直接走人
You don't show them the gun. And you go.

251
00:24:23,158 --> 00:24:26,208
骑上摩托车  我在四条街外接你
Get on your bike. I'll be about four blocks away.

252
00:24:26,228 --> 00:24:27,836
把摩托车开进卡车
Ride it into the truck.

253
00:24:27,836 --> 00:24:30,036
然后我们回家就成了  我们就有钱了
Bam we're home, we're done, we're rich.

254
00:24:34,945 --> 00:24:36,196
你把车停在路边
What happens if you get stopped

255
00:24:36,196 --> 00:24:38,424
把货箱门开着没事吗
sitting by the side of the road with a open cube truck.

256
00:24:38,424 --> 00:24:39,874
你要怎么说
What are you gonna say?

257
00:24:39,874 --> 00:24:41,974
-什么意思  -假设我是警察
- What do you mean what I'm gonna do? - I'm a officer.

258
00:24:42,034 --> 00:24:43,864
先生  你把货箱门开着干嘛
Excuse me, sir. What are you doing with a open cube truck?

259
00:24:43,914 --> 00:24:46,043
你在这做什么  为什么要停在这
What are you doing? Why are you sitting here like this?

260
00:24:46,144 --> 00:24:49,852
我的车坏了  我在等人来修
Oh I'm broken down. I'm waiting for the, you know, repairs.

261
00:24:50,882 --> 00:24:53,202
谢谢关心  警官
Thank you for asking officer.

262
00:24:53,322 --> 00:24:54,812
-回答得很好  -是吧
- That's a nice touch. - Right.

263
00:24:54,841 --> 00:24:57,219
要是你屁股长了癣
What are you gonna do if you get jock itch and you know you...

264
00:24:57,239 --> 00:24:59,410
你必须以90英里的时速在街上狂飙
you're riding ninty miles a hour down the street.

265
00:24:59,410 --> 00:25:00,790
你还是会骑的是吧
You're gonna keep riding right?

266
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:03,680
我是说我们得各司其职
Yeah? I mean we do what we do.

267
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:08,938
要是我们联手的话  就无敌了
But when we do it together? Pssshh... Shazam.

268
00:25:10,148 --> 00:25:12,108
我只是说说
I'm just saying.

269
00:25:12,268 --> 00:25:15,295
自从霍哈二重唱后就没有这样的团队了
Not since Hall and Oates, has there been such a team.

270
00:25:12,268 --> 00:25:15,295
霍哈二重唱  美国老牌流行摇滚乐团

271
00:25:16,077 --> 00:25:17,746
你想当哪个  我知道了
Which one do you... Oh, I know.

272
00:25:17,746 --> 00:25:19,916
所以我是黑卷发的那个
So I got to be the dark curly hair guy?

273
00:25:19,956 --> 00:25:23,486
你是长得帅的那个  这样就对了
You got to be the good looking one? I guess that's about right.

274
00:25:23,496 --> 00:25:25,914
我们一定能成的  你会爱上这行的
This is going to be good. You're going to like doing this.

275
00:25:26,015 --> 00:25:28,404
这是你人生最大一搏
Biggest rush of your life.

276
00:26:55,331 --> 00:26:59,182
想活命的就把手举起来
Everybody who wants to live put your hands in the fucking air!

277

我需要点帮助
I could use just a little help

307
00:30:07,324 --> 00:30:09,966
如果你要生火
You can't start a fire

308
00:30:09,966 --> 00:30:14,086
怎能没有火星
You can't start a fire without a spark

309
00:30:14,086 --> 00:30:16,588
我们需要租枪
This gun's for hire

310
00:30:16,588 --> 00:30:20,884
即使我们只是在黑暗中起舞
even if we're just dancing in the dark

311
00:30:23,744 --> 00:30:27,159
即使我们只是在黑暗中起舞
even if we're just dancing in the dark

312
00:30:29,622 --> 00:30:33,952
即使我们只是在黑暗中起舞
even if we're just dancing in the dark

313
00:30:35,030 --> 00:30:36,534
跟我讲讲他吧
Tell me about him.

314
00:30:38,950 --> 00:30:40,690
他喜欢吃什么
What's he like eat?

315
00:30:42,490 --> 00:30:45,158
他喜欢  很喜欢吃苹果

316
00:30:45,577 --> 00:30:47,788
虽然都是我嚼过才喂给他
Though I kind of have to chew it up for him.

317
00:30:47,888 --> 00:30:50,039
-你给他嚼苹果  -是啊
- You chew up his apple? - Yeah.

318
00:30:51,174 --> 00:30:54,444
听着挺恶心  但我喂他时不觉得
It sounds gross but it's not when I'm doing it.

319
00:31:04,692 --> 00:31:06,976
他吃过冰淇淋吗
Has he ever had ice cream?

320
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,080
还没
Not yet.

321
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,040
开玩笑吧
You fucking kidding me?

322
00:31:12,770 --> 00:31:15,437
-他还太小  -胡扯
- He's still a baby. - Bullshit.

323
00:31:15,878 --> 00:31:17,637
你这当的什么家啊
What kind of house are you running?

324
00:31:18,068 --> 00:31:19,318
连冰淇淋都没有
No ice cream.

325
00:31:22,448 --> 00:31:23,728
为什么他不能吃冰淇淋呢
Why can't he have that?

326
00:31:24,797 --> 00:31:27,515
不是他不能吃  只是还没让他吃
It's not like he can't have any. He just hasn't had it.

327
00:31:27,736 --> 00:31:29,246
我可以给他吃冰淇淋吗

I want to do something with him that's his first time.

330
00:31:37,944 --> 00:31:40,164
他吃冰淇淋的时候我想看着他的脸
I want to look at his face when he tries ice cream.

331
00:31:40,204 --> 00:31:42,504
以后他每次吃冰淇淋的时候
Every time he has ice cream for the rest of his life,

332
00:31:42,504 --> 00:31:43,994
我都要让他看到我的脸
he's going to see my fucking face.

333
00:31:59,010 --> 00:32:02,800
-得了吧  -他真的太好玩了
- Okay, come on. - Ah, he's really funny.

-车子真不错  -车是我们家庭的一员
- It's a nice bike. - Bike's part of the family.

340
00:32:55,173 --> 00:32:56,598
再来一张吧
You want another one?

341
00:32:57,050 --> 00:33:00,004
你确定要在她哭的时候拍吗
You sure I should take it when she's crying?

342
00:33:01,024 --> 00:33:02,064

- Did you announce yourself again or not? - No.

626
00:54:54,938 --> 00:54:57,453
没  我们只需要自报家门吧
No. That's all we need to do is make ourselves known right?

627
00:54:58,627 --> 00:55:00,578
对  但有时很难确认
Yeah. But it's sometimes not easy to

628
00:55:00,578 --> 00:55:03,628
他们是否听见你自报家门了
tell whether if they've heard you making yourself known.

629
00:55:05,706 --> 00:55:07,000
明白我的意思吗
You know what I mean?

反正你喊了  对吧
Anway, you were yelling, is that right?

这时我知道我得冲进去
At that point I knew I had

635
00:55:19,454 --> 00:55:21,644
我就把门踹开了
to make entry and I kicked the door down.

636
00:55:22,064 --> 00:55:24,264
-门锁了吗  -锁了
- Was the door, was the door locked? - Correct.

637
00:55:24,304 --> 00:55:26,043

-我怎么知道门锁了吗  -对
- How did I know it was locked? - Yeah.

640
00:55:32,522 --> 00:55:34,342
这个问题是陷阱吗
Is that a trick question?

641
00:55:34,402 --> 00:55:36,532
没有  我只想知道你为什么没拧把手
No, no. I'm just wondering why you didn't turn the thing.

642
00:55:36,613 --> 00:55:38,037
我拧了才知道门锁了的
That's how I know it was locked.

643
00:55:39,060 --> 00:55:40,160
你告诉我了吗

-没有  -好吧
- No. - Okay.

645
00:55:44,579 --> 00:55:45,919

他先还是你先
Did you shoot him first or did he shoot first?

660

忙孩子的事都对她没帮助
What do you mean that it doesn't help

740
01:00:37,282 --> 01:00:38,044
是什么意思
that there's a baby around?

741
01:00:40,018 --> 01:00:41,018
我的意思是

不是想吃完就跑  我们还得执勤
Not that we want to eat and run but, we are on duty.

820
01:05:00,414 --> 01:05:01,984
没事  你们该去  那主意不错
No you should go. That's a great idea.

821
01:05:01,984 --> 01:05:03,724
大家肯定很想见你
I'm sure everybody would love to meet you.

822
01:05:04,064 --> 01:05:06,715
-好了  -你是英雄
- There you have it. - You're a hero.

823
01:05:08,469 --> 01:05:10,392
你的声音有点讽刺的意味
I hear a little sarcasm in your voice.

824
01:05:10,532 --> 01:05:11,552
-我吗  -对
- Me? - Yeah.

-他是英雄  -对

826
01:05:13,082 --> 01:05:14,301
他当然是这里的英雄
He's a hero around here, that's for sure.

827
01:05:14,301 --> 01:05:15,570
那你不介意我们带他走吧
You don't mind if we take him then, do you?

828
01:05:15,600 --> 01:05:18,076
-不介意  这主意不错  -好的
- Not at all. I think it's a great idea. - Yeah. Alright.

829
01:05:18,116 --> 01:05:20,260
好了  你被释放了
There you have it. You're released.

830
01:05:20,650 --> 01:05:22,800
-放虎归山  -太好了

艾弗里
Hey, Avery...

832
01:05:32,708 --> 01:05:36,638
起码有时晚上她会愿意不那么男人吧
Does she sometimes like to tuck her balls up at least at night?

833
01:05:39,696 --> 01:05:41,536
皮特  皮特
Hey, Pete. Pete.

834
01:05:41,576 --> 01:05:42,896
-怎么了  -开下后备箱行吗
- What? - Can you pop the trunk?

835
01:05:42,936 --> 01:05:45,283
好的  你老婆同意吗
Sure it's okay with her?

836
01:05:49,695 --> 01:05:52,500
斯科特  你知道我执不了勤吧
Scott, you know I'm not on active duty right?

837
01:05:52,500 --> 01:05:53,430
知道
Yeah, we're aware.

838
01:05:53,580 --> 01:05:55,768
是打算给你点礼物
It's a little gift I got going for you.

839
01:05:57,061 --> 01:05:58,605
走吧

01:06:07,791 --> 01:06:10,556
-罗米娜在那  -嗯

我们来搜查您的房子
Yeah, we're here to search your house.

846
01:06:19,544 --> 01:06:20,364
搜什么
What for?

847
01:06:20,464 --> 01:06:22,354
-证据  -什么证据
- For evidence. - Evidence for what?

848
01:06:22,404 --> 01:06:23,624
我们在找卢克・格兰顿
We're looking for the money

849
01:06:23,634 --> 01:06:25,943
或许有给你的钱
that Luke Glanton may or may have not given to you.

850
01:06:25,973 --> 01:06:28,459
我们没有那种东西
Yeah, we don't have anything thing that that...

851
01:06:29,441 --> 01:06:31,292
你不能就这么闯进来
Ah you can't just walk in here.

852
01:06:31,382 --> 01:06:32,022
我可以
Yeah, I can.

853
01:06:32,072 --> 01:06:33,552
-不行  -为什么
- No, you can't. - Why's that?

854
01:06:34,152 --> 01:06:35,459
因为这是我家
Cause it's my house.

855
01:06:35,891 --> 01:06:37,084
听着
Look...

856
01:06:37,134 --> 01:06:38,828
你假装我们有搜查令
You assume that I have a warrant

857
01:06:38,828 --> 01:06:41,420
我就假装你妈妈有居住证  好吗
and I'll assume that your mother has papers okay?

858
01:06:43,090 --> 01:06:44,499
不会很久的
This won't take long.

859
01:06:45,397 --> 01:06:46,460
来吧
Come on.

860
01:06:46,520 --> 01:06:47,021
科菲
Kofi.

861
01:06:47,262 --> 01:06:49,056
我们从楼上开始好吗
Can we just start upstairs okay?

862
01:06:49,076 --> 01:06:51,508
不不不  我孩子在楼上
No, no, no, no. No, no, my baby is upstairs.

863
01:06:51,528 --> 01:06:53,308
-我孩子在楼上睡觉  -孩子在楼上吗
- My baby, my baby is upstairs sleeping. - Baby's upstairs?

864
01:06:53,328 --> 01:06:54,258
孩子正在楼上睡觉
Yeah, my baby is upstairs sleeping,

865
01:06:54,258 --> 01:06:55,185
别从楼上开始
so we're not going to start...

866
01:06:55,185 --> 01:06:56,348
没关系  我们不会吵醒孩子的
Alright. Well we won't rustle your baby.

867
01:06:56,568 --> 01:06:57,942
别  别上去
No, no, no. Don't go up there.

868
01:06:57,972 --> 01:06:59,796
-罗米娜  -放松  放松
- Romina... - Hey, hey, hey. Relax, relax.

869
01:06:59,816 --> 01:07:01,816
-他不能上去  -他能
- He can't go up there. - Yeah, he can.

870
01:07:01,876 --> 01:07:03,196
你要是愿意的话也可以上去
You can go up there if you want,

871
01:07:03,196 --> 01:07:04,844
那就算人赃俱获了
but if we find evidence while you're up there,

872
01:07:04,844 --> 01:07:05,574
你就要被逮捕了
your under arrest.

873
01:07:05,574 --> 01:07:06,676
为什么
Why?

874
01:07:06,727 --> 01:07:10,264
我们做了很多次了  会很安静的
We've done this a lot of times okay. It'll be quiet.

875
01:07:10,854 --> 01:07:12,734
去吧  斯科特  安静点
Go on, Scotty. Be quiet.

876
01:07:16,634 --> 01:07:18,439
-给我来杯咖啡吧  -好的  好的
- How about a cup of coffee? - Yes, yes, yes.

877
01:07:18,469 --> 01:07:19,431
太好了
That'll be great.

878
01:07:21,242 --> 01:07:23,442
我能进客厅吗
Is that fine? Go into your living room here?

879
01:07:23,442 --> 01:07:24,252
是的  请进吧
Yeah, yeah. Go ahead.

880
01:07:24,272 --> 01:07:25,110
谢谢
Thanks.

881
01:07:31,756 --> 01:07:33,926
节哀顺变
Sorry for your loss.

882
01:07:39,644 --> 01:07:42,684
罗米娜  我们走  走吧
Romina, lets go. Come on.

883
01:08:00,040 --> 01:08:02,010
我们要做什么  到底要做什么
What are we doing? What are we doing here?

884
01:08:02,220 --> 01:08:04,659
这太离谱了
Hey, this is crazy.

885
01:08:05,478 --> 01:08:06,600
在外面等着
Wait outside.

886
01:08:06,600 --> 01:08:08,856
我不等  我要走了  真他妈荒唐
I don't want to. We gotta go. This is fucked up.

887
01:08:08,946 --> 01:08:10,918
-我们他妈的干嘛来这  -放开我
- Why the fuck are we here? - Let go of my arm man.

888
01:08:10,948 --> 01:08:13,558
-我们到底要做什么  -放开我
- What the fuck are we doing here? - Let go of my arm.

889
01:08:13,598 --> 01:08:15,626
斯科特  我们他妈的来做什么
Scott, what the fuck are we doing here?

890
01:08:15,626 --> 01:08:16,227
闭嘴
Shut up.

891
01:08:21,336 --> 01:08:24,585
-你认识卢克多久了  -有几年了
- About how long did you know Luke? - A couple of years.

892
01:08:24,635 --> 01:08:27,579
-你知道他抢银行了吗  -不知道
- Did you know he was robbing banks? - No.

893
01:08:27,629 --> 01:08:29,313
-完全不知道  -是的
- You didn't know that at all? - No.

894
01:08:30,014 --> 01:08:31,394
因为工作需要
Let me just ask you one more

895
01:08:31,394 --> 01:08:33,504
我再问你一遍
time because this is... this is what we do.

896
01:08:34,273 --> 01:08:37,687
-你对这笔钱一无所知  -是的
- You have no knowledge to this money? - No.

897
01:08:37,727 --> 01:08:40,432
-警官  我对天发誓  -钱不在这吗

898
01:08:40,762 --> 01:08:43,382
-不在  -也没在外面
- No - It's not outside?

899
01:08:43,432 --> 01:08:45,580
如果我要藏什么东西
If I was gonna hid something

900
01:08:45,580 --> 01:08:48,216
我肯定藏在心腹之地
I would hide it closest to my heart.

901
01:08:54,579 --> 01:08:55,678
斯科特
Scott.

902
01:09:02,198 --> 01:09:03,268
抱起他来
Pick him up.

903
01:09:04,367 --> 01:09:06,789
-把孩子抱起来  -我们不该这样
- Pick up the baby. - I don't think we should.

904
01:09:06,829 --> 01:09:07,952
我不想弄醒他
I don't want to wake him.

905
01:09:07,952 --> 01:09:09,991
-我不想抱他  -抱起来  抱起来
- I don't wanna pick him up. - Pick him up, pick him up.

906
01:09:49,593 --> 01:09:50,934
好了
I'm good.

907
01:09:52,884 --> 01:09:55,062
放回去  我们走
Put him back. Let's go.

908
01:10:27,190 --> 01:10:28,703
-怎么样  -他们清白了
- What's up? - Yeah, they're clean.

909
01:10:31,256 --> 01:10:34,445
好的  那就不打扰了
Alrighty, let's get out of your hair.

910
01:10:36,646 --> 01:10:39,323
是你找到的  斯科特  拜托
You got this Scotty, c'mon.

911
01:10:39,323 --> 01:10:40,114
快帮帮他  行吗
Help him out, will you.

912
01:10:40,364 --> 01:10:42,724
-斯科特  停  停  -让我数数
- Scotty stop, stop. - Give me a chance to count it.

913
01:10:42,764 --> 01:10:43,774
按你这么数
You... you going to count like that,

914
01:10:43,774 --> 01:10:45,122
我们凌晨五点都数不完
we're going to be here till five in the morning.

915
01:10:45,161 --> 01:10:46,203
那你怎么数
How are you gonna count it?

916
01:10:46,203 --> 01:10:47,937
-你有点钞机啊  -是啊  是啊
- You got a money counter there asshole? - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

917
01:10:48,338 --> 01:10:50,848
-一万四大洋  -一万四吗
- Fourteen grand. - $14,000?

918
01:10:50,978 --> 01:10:52,728
我们就不用平分了
Well it's not going to be a even split

919
01:10:52,728 --> 01:10:55,576
大份当然属于我们的英雄
because the lion's share is going to our hero.

920
01:10:56,257 --> 01:10:59,244
就当做是非官方的危险补贴吧
Consider it unofficial hazard pay.

921
01:11:01,396 --> 01:11:03,356
我们送你的
From us to you.

922
01:11:04,665 --> 01:11:05,824
笑纳吧
Enjoy it.

923
01:11:06,596 --> 01:11:08,761
我们部门是不会给你补贴的
Cause you're not going to get it from the department.

924
01:11:09,483 --> 01:11:12,074
别都花在同一个地方
Don't spend it all on one place.

925
01:11:12,434 --> 01:11:14,733
这他妈是你应得的  别忘了
You fucking earned that. Don't forget that.

926
01:11:15,421 --> 01:11:18,769
不错吧  一晚收获颇丰
Not bad huh? Not bad for a nights work.

927
01:11:42,408 --> 01:11:43,798
我们齐聚一堂
We're gathered here to

928
01:11:43,798 --> 01:11:46,518
来赞美一个让我们引以为豪的警察
celebrate a cop who makes other cops proud.

929
01:11:46,688 --> 01:11:48,402
看到他渐渐康复
We can all rest a little easier tonight

930
01:11:48,402 --> 01:11:51,006
我们可以松一口气
now that he is on the path to recovery.

931
01:11:51,066 --> 01:11:54,525
女士们先生们  艾弗里・克罗斯警官
Ladies and gentleman, Officer Avery Cross.

932
01:11:59,403 --> 01:12:02,794
谢谢你们的支持
Thank you. Thank you for your support.

933
01:12:03,604 --> 01:12:07,075
读法学院的时候  我们常常谈论正义
When I was in law school, we used to always talk about Justice.

934
01:12:08,178 --> 01:12:10,752
我们讨论正义
We had discussions about justice.

935
01:12:12,982 --> 01:12:14,651
但也仅仅如此而已
That's just what they were.

936
01:12:15,530 --> 01:12:16,873
仅限于讨论
Discussions.

937
01:12:17,194 --> 01:12:18,456
我之所以成为一名警察
I joined the police force

938
01:12:18,456 --> 01:12:20,490
是因为我想和最勇敢的人一起
because I wanted to work alonside the

939
01:12:20,530 --> 01:12:21,900
并肩作战
brave men and women who

940
01:12:21,900 --> 01:12:24,459
我们都知道光说解决不了问题
know some problems can't be solved by talk.

941
01:12:25,317 --> 01:12:26,620
但谁都不想遭遇
But no one wants to be in the situation

942
01:12:26,620 --> 01:12:28,878
我几周前的情况
I found myself in a couple of weeks ago.

943
01:12:29,708 --> 01:12:32,794
我诚然希望有不一样的结果
I certainly wish it had turned out differently.

944
01:12:33,134 --> 01:12:37,075
说实话  有时候我希望
I'm not going to lie. Sometimes I haven't wished that

945
01:12:37,366 --> 01:12:40,792
那天闯进房子的不是我
maybe it wasn't me that was called upon that house that day.

946
01:12:42,042 --> 01:12:43,452
但这就是我的工作
But that's the job.

947
01:12:44,481 --> 01:12:46,923
我无法设想自己从事其他的工作
But I can't think of another line of work I would rather be in.

948
01:12:47,594 --> 01:12:48,707
谢谢
Thank you.

949
01:13:07,450 --> 01:13:09,104
怎么样
How does it feel?

950
01:13:11,156 --> 01:13:13,326
我觉得没什么帮助
I'm not sure it's doing much good.

951
01:13:14,595 --> 01:13:17,819
-聚光灯下的生活呢  -我都想结束了
- How's the spotlight? - I'm ready for it to end.

952
01:13:19,433 --> 01:13:21,344
别担心  会结束的
Don't worry. It will.

953
01:13:22,844 --> 01:13:24,353
警局总是这样
You know the police always put on a big show

954
01:13:24,353 --> 01:13:26,614
把这种事小题大做
when something like this happens

955
01:13:27,186 --> 01:13:29,501
因为他们只剩英雄牌可打了
because the hero card is the only one they have to play.

956
01:13:29,952 --> 01:13:31,332
我倒是没想那么多
I'm not really thinking about that Dad.

957
01:13:31,332 --> 01:13:32,622
我只是想回去工作
I'm just trying to get back to work.

958
01:13:33,382 --> 01:13:34,441
如果你已经计划好
You know if you planned this

959
01:13:34,441 --> 01:13:36,472
就再好不过了
it couldn't have turned out any better.

960
01:13:37,464 --> 01:13:39,268
但这样在警局
You're not going to make it work

961
01:13:39,268 --> 01:13:40,770
是行不通的
for you in the police department.

962
01:13:40,980 --> 01:13:42,190
我保证
I promise you that.

963
01:13:42,680 --> 01:13:44,419
我不是来这上课的爸爸
I didn't come here to be lectured Dad.

964
01:13:44,589 --> 01:13:48,605
你骗我  你说游泳对膝盖好
You tricked me. You said the pool would be good for my knee.

965
01:13:48,966 --> 01:13:52,128
-抱歉  -我不像你那样会算计
- Sorry. - You know, I'm not as calculated as you are.

966
01:13:52,388 --> 01:13:55,676
我的生活不是一场竞选  简单得多
My life is not a campaign. It's much simpler.

967
01:13:55,786 --> 01:13:56,738
是啊
Yeah.

968
01:13:57,149 --> 01:13:59,124
对一个不是参加竞选的人来说
Though for somebody who's not campaigning,

969
01:13:59,134 --> 01:14:00,926
你昨天可是来了一次精彩演说
you gave a hell of a speech yesterday.

970
01:14:01,166 --> 01:14:03,186
我肯定投票给你
You certainly have my vote.

971
01:14:04,944 --> 01:14:07,057
再加上膝盖这个小金矿
Plus that knee is a gold mine.

972
01:14:09,205 --> 01:14:12,870
真的  瘸腿在政治中不少见
No I mean it. A limp goes a long way in politics.

973
01:14:15,858 --> 01:14:17,642
罗斯福  美国前总统  因患有脊髓灰质炎症而导致腿部残疾

974
01:14:15,858 --> 01:14:17,642
想想罗斯福
Look at Roosevelt.

975
01:14:51,362 --> 01:14:53,022
我得去找警长  我得去找警长
I got to go see the chief. I got to go see the chief.

976
01:14:53,052 --> 01:14:54,850
-去哪啊  老兄  -不知道
- Where you going, brother? - I don't know. I don't know.

977
01:14:54,870 --> 01:14:57,795
坏消息吗  会是坏消息吗
Is it bad news? Is it gonna be bad news?

978
01:15:04,519 --> 01:15:06,520
天啊
Oh, Jesus Christ.

979
01:15:07,612 --> 01:15:09,918
别乱了发型  靓仔
Don't mess your hair up, pretty boy.

980
01:15:17,240 --> 01:15:20,036
我今天接到地方检察官金库伦的电话
I got a call today from D.A. Killcullen.

981
01:15:20,676 --> 01:15:21,626
关上门
Close the door.

982
01:15:25,704 --> 01:15:27,448
内部调查结果
The state internal investigation

983
01:15:27,448 --> 01:15:30,344
将对卢克・格兰顿射击视为合法
into shooting of Luke Glanton has been deemed lawful.

984
01:15:31,094 --> 01:15:32,564
恭喜你  警官
Congratulations officer.

985
01:15:32,714 --> 01:15:35,933
这事可以放下了  恢复工作吧
You can put it behind you. Get back to police work.

986
01:15:36,303 --> 01:15:39,370
问题是你可以尽快回去巡逻吗
The question is can you go back out on patrol anytime soon?

987
01:15:39,410 --> 01:15:42,202
如果可以的话  还能保证效率吗
And if you could, can you be effective?

988
01:15:42,672 --> 01:15:43,882
我觉得不能
I don't think that I can.

989
01:15:44,521 --> 01:15:45,951
没关系
That's okay. You know what

990
01:15:45,951 --> 01:15:48,446
这还有很多工作可以做呢
there's a lot of jobs to be done around here.

991
01:15:48,657 --> 01:15:50,069
你也知道的
That in ways and you know that.

992
01:15:50,100 --> 01:15:51,086
很多工作
In ways that are much more important

993
01:15:51,086 --> 01:15:52,816
都比外勤更重要
than what happens out on the street.

994
01:15:52,856 --> 01:15:54,255
很高兴您这么说
I'm so glad that you said that.

995
01:15:54,265 --> 01:15:56,706
警长  我想了很久
Because Chief I've thought a lot about this and the...

996
01:15:57,959 --> 01:16:00,264
我觉得  我最好是
I... I think I can be best utilized as

997
01:16:00,264 --> 01:16:03,404
去特殊调查组做主管
as lieutenant in... in charge of special investigations.

998
01:16:03,594 --> 01:16:04,912
那个部门正好在重组
There's a lot of restructuring

999
01:16:04,912 --> 01:16:06,905
我实际上
within the division that I've actually formally...

1000
01:16:06,925 --> 01:16:08,649
我不能这么做
I can't fucking do that.

1001
01:16:09,070 --> 01:16:11,922
当然  您当然能  我意思是
Well yeah, of course... of course you could. I mean...

1002
01:16:13,562 --> 01:16:14,810
克罗斯  得了吧
Cross, come on.

1003
01:16:14,810 --> 01:16:17,254
你受过这么良好的教育  去那也太傻了
You paid too much for your education to act so stupid.

1004
01:16:17,284 --> 01:16:18,336
正是因为我受过这样的教育
But I think it is the very fact

1005
01:16:18,346 --> 01:16:20,120
所以我才去思考
that I do have a education like this that perhaps...

1006
01:16:20,150 --> 01:16:21,220
如何重组这个部门
the reason why I thought

1007
01:16:21,220 --> 01:16:23,090
才能使这个部门
about how restructuring the... the unit...

1008
01:16:23,110 --> 01:16:25,088
对大家更有益
Um, the division can actually benefit you, me, and a couple...

1009
01:16:25,088 --> 01:16:27,753
克罗斯  我欣赏你的雄心壮志  真的
Cross, I appreciate you ambition. I really do.

1010
01:16:28,444 --> 01:16:29,967
我觉得
Uh and uh I think... you know...you..

1011
01:16:29,967 --> 01:16:31,618
我觉得你能成一名好警察
I think you are going to be a great cop.

1012
01:16:31,648 --> 01:16:33,618
你已经是名好警察了  你是个英雄
You are a great cop. You're a hero.

1013
01:16:33,648 --> 01:16:37,320
但这件事  你得面对现实
But at this point. Right now. You gotta get back to real life.

1014
01:16:37,340 --> 01:16:39,985
-现实就是你有两种选择  -什么选择
- And in real life you got two choices. - Which are?

1015
01:16:40,016 --> 01:16:43,496
-你可以因伤退休  -我不想退休
- You can retire on disability. - I don't want to do that.

1016
01:16:43,536 --> 01:16:46,135
很好  我也不想让你退休
Alright, good. I don't want you to do that either. Or...

1017
01:16:46,185 --> 01:16:49,422
或者以你现有的级别指派
You can be reassigned at your current rank.

1018
01:16:50,604 --> 01:16:51,934
就是这样
That's it.

1019
01:16:52,484 --> 01:16:54,473
你得一步步升上来
You gotta work your way up, man.

1020
01:16:59,851 --> 01:17:01,552
伙计  听说你在这
Hey man. I heard you were down here.

1021
01:17:01,872 --> 01:17:02,972
你好
Hey.

1022
01:17:03,212 --> 01:17:04,880
你在做什么
What are you doing?

1023
01:17:06,853 --> 01:17:08,256
你怎么穿了便衣
What are you doing on plain clothes?

1024
01:17:08,516 --> 01:17:10,390
你没听说吗  我调到缉捕队了
Oh you didn't hear? I made Vice.

1025
01:17:11,650 --> 01:17:13,290
-滚开  -真的
- Get the fuck outta here. - Yeah man,

1026
01:17:13,290 --> 01:17:14,878
我和德卢卡搭档
I'm actually paired up with Deluca.

1027
01:17:15,668 --> 01:17:17,101
好吧  你拿的什么
Good. What have you got for me?

1028
01:17:17,322 --> 01:17:19,126
几个小杂种
Oh yeah. A couple of mutts left this

1029
01:17:19,126 --> 01:17:21,778
把毒品落在后座了
in the back seat of their car with a leaky substance.

1030
01:17:21,808 --> 01:17:22,848
好吧
Oh nice.

1031
01:17:23,388 --> 01:17:26,307
什么时候我们一起聚聚  吃点东西
So when are we going to get together? Grab a little bite.

1032
01:17:26,478 --> 01:17:27,650
我想好好谈谈
I want to talk about some things.

1033
01:17:27,670 --> 01:17:29,137
-可以啊  -好的
- Sounds great. - Alright man.

1034
01:17:29,435 --> 01:17:30,532

- Page me. - Okay.

1035
01:17:30,672 --> 01:17:31,522
谢谢
Thanks.

1036
01:17:33,452 --> 01:17:35,840
我求你这事儿挺敏感的
What I'm about to ask you is very sensitive.

1037
01:17:35,931 --> 01:17:38,155
因为把你当朋友才求你
The only reason I'm asking you is because you're my friend.

1038
01:17:38,506 --> 01:17:39,809
我不知道怎么帮你
Well I don't know what I can do to help...

1039
01:17:39,839 --> 01:17:41,810
-你说吧  -好的
- but yeah. What do you need? - Alright. Right on.

1040
01:17:42,060 --> 01:17:44,289
德卢卡和我在忙这个案子
Deluca and I have been working on this case right.

1041
01:17:44,898 --> 01:17:48,654
我要你保密
And uh... I'm going to need you to keep this to yourself.

1042
01:17:48,654 --> 01:17:49,216
这有点涉及隐私
It's a little private.

1043
01:17:49,907 --> 01:17:54,038
我不想让任何人知道  好吗
And uh... I don't want anybody to know about it, okay?

1044
01:17:54,118 --> 01:17:55,195
好的
Okay.

1045
01:17:56,117 --> 01:17:58,131
德卢卡和我的这个案子里有个婊子
Deluca and I have been working with this fucking hooker.

1046
01:17:58,552 --> 01:18:00,656
我们得想办法摆平她
We gotta fucking head her off with some coke.

1047
01:18:01,336 --> 01:18:03,796
德卢卡和我想
So Deluca and I thought that you know, if...

1048
01:18:04,295 --> 01:18:06,516
我们需要在证据室有个临时接应
We need some temporary access to the evidence room.

1049
01:18:06,536 --> 01:18:07,578
我们需要你搞点手脚
We need you to get some shit.

1050
01:18:07,578 --> 01:18:09,342
我们得摆平这个贱人  他是这么想的
We gotta hit this bitch off. That's what he need.

1051
01:18:10,694 --> 01:18:13,384
你那七千块的事我努力帮你打点好了
I really tried to look out for you with that seven grand.

1052
01:18:13,824 --> 01:18:15,371
现在你也得帮我们
Now I need you to look out for me.

1053
01:18:16,965 --> 01:18:19,470
我是认真的  老兄  得有来有往
I'm serious, bro. This is how it works.

1054
01:20:11,956 --> 01:20:13,816
别担心  没事的
Hey, don't worry. It's okay.

1055
01:20:16,636 --> 01:20:18,791
我没想吓到你
So I didn't mean to startle you.

1056
01:20:18,981 --> 01:20:21,304
没事  我只是想给你点东西
It's okay. I just want to give you something.

1057
01:20:22,064 --> 01:20:23,964
听着
Alright. Listen.

1058
01:20:24,014 --> 01:20:25,281
这是我们从你房子里搜到的钱
This is the money we recovered from your house okay.

1059
01:20:25,281 --> 01:20:27,155
你拿着它
I want you to have it.

1060
01:20:27,185 --> 01:20:28,829
我不知道这是什么
I don't know what that is.

1061
01:20:30,322 --> 01:20:33,002
你不用再见到我  拿着钱
You don't have to ever see me again. Just take the money.

1062
01:20:33,562 --> 01:20:36,372
别把我当警察  就当我是个普通人
I'm not here as a police officer. I'm here as a regular guy.

1063
01:20:36,632 --> 01:20:37,674
听着  听着  听我说
Listen, listen, listen.

1064
01:20:37,714 --> 01:20:39,398
-滚开  -听我说
- Get the fuck away. - Listen to me. Listen.

1065
01:20:39,448 --> 01:20:41,860
你毁了我儿子的生活
You fucked up my son's life.

1066
01:20:42,130 --> 01:20:46,099
也就是毁了我的生活  滚开
Therefore you fucked up my life. Get the fuck away from me.

1067
01:20:59,801 --> 01:21:03,052
我该早点拿给你的  抱歉
I should have brought this to you sooner. I apologize.

1068
01:21:03,312 --> 01:21:05,199
这是上次搜查的时候
This was recovered from

1069
01:21:05,249 --> 01:21:06,592
搜到的钱
a house during a search.

1070
01:21:06,772 --> 01:21:08,596
什么  等等
No, what, what, wait a minute.

1071
01:21:08,596 --> 01:21:11,490
这只是搜到的一小部分
That's just a small fraction of what's going on.

1072
01:21:12,340 --> 01:21:13,970
等等  克罗斯
Wait a minute, Cross.

1073
01:21:15,558 --> 01:21:16,971
什么也别说了
Don't say another word.

1074
01:21:17,572 --> 01:21:19,726
-什么意思  -不  不  别说话
- What do you mean? - No, no, no. Don't say another word.

1075
01:21:27,851 --> 01:21:30,516
你指望我能做点什么
What do you expect me to do with this?

1076
01:21:30,846 --> 01:21:32,516
-你开玩笑的吧  -胡扯
- You're joking right? - This is shit.

1077
01:21:32,636 --> 01:21:33,616
警长
Chief.

1078
01:21:33,726 --> 01:21:35,734
这不是我的问题
This ain't my problem. Alright.

1079
01:21:36,756 --> 01:21:37,939
这是你的问题
This is your problem.

1080
01:21:38,009 --> 01:21:39,512
这他妈的是我们部门的问题
This is our problem of the fucking police department

1081
01:21:39,512 --> 01:21:42,044
我把这个给你
and I'm bringing it to your attention

1082
01:21:42,084 --> 01:21:44,044
因为这他妈的才是我应该做的
because that's what I should fucking do!

1083
01:21:44,083 --> 01:21:45,412
是吗  你这么想
Oh yeah? Is that right?

1084
01:21:45,512 --> 01:21:47,406
-没错  -这是你应该做的
- Yeah! - Is that what you should do?

1085
01:21:47,646 --> 01:21:49,269
-他妈的出卖兄弟  -警长
- Rat out other fucking cops? - Chief

1086
01:21:49,290 --> 01:21:51,212
真他妈不能相信
This is unfucking believable alright.

1087
01:21:51,662 --> 01:21:53,292
带着钱滚出去
Get this shit outta here.

1088
01:23:19,037 --> 01:23:20,139
见鬼
Fuck.

1089
01:23:47,678 --> 01:23:49,071
你要去哪
Where are you going?

01:23:53,614 --> 01:23:54,363
回家
Going home.

1091
01:23:58,247 --> 01:24:00,382
你知道那件事

Sure.

1095
01:24:11,066 --> 01:24:13,896
那我们得好好谈谈了
Well you and I have to talk about it.

1096
01:24:15,484 --> 01:24:16,636
跟我走
Follow me.

1097

我有一个办法
There's a way out of this.

1100
01:26:55,528 --> 01:26:59,065
你肯定不会喜欢的
You're not going to like it.

1101
01:26:59,986 --> 01:27:00,938
想听吗
You want to hear?

1102
01:27:07,730 --> 01:27:09,654
想  我想听
Yeah, I wanna hear it.

1103
01:27:10,996 --> 01:27:12,776
你得从你们警区下手
We'll start with the precinct.

1104
01:27:13,176 --> 01:27:15,104
还有人信任你吗
Anybody there still trust you?

1105
01:27:16,446 --> 01:27:17,778
斯科特
Scott.

1106
01:27:19,001 --> 01:27:20,864
那就从斯科特开始
We'll start with Scott.

1107
01:27:29,420 --> 01:27:30,858
看那游击手
Playing shortstop.

1108
01:27:32,028 --> 01:27:34,826
看起来不错  更强壮了
Looks good. Looks bigger. Jesus Christ.

1109
01:27:36,768 --> 01:27:38,281
你当时真是吓了卢克一跳啊
You really gave Luke a quiet scare.

1110
01:27:38,451 --> 01:27:41,076
他准备摆脱你了  摆脱整件事
He's ready to dump you. The whole thing.

1111
01:27:41,276 --> 01:27:42,896
我他妈的受够了这些考验了
Enough with these fucking tests alright.

1112
01:27:42,916 --> 01:27:45,193
要么就有事说事  要么就别烦我
Either ask me to help you or just leave me the fuck alone.

1113
01:27:49,091 --> 01:27:50,313
我要你进到证据室
I need you to go into the locker.

1114
01:27:50,313 --> 01:27:51,824
把麦金伦的箱子拿出来
I need you to take the McKillen case out.

1115
01:27:51,854 --> 01:27:53,674
那有一公斤重  是个大箱子
It's a... it's a kilo. It's a big brick.

1116
01:27:53,684 --> 01:27:55,142
上面写着麦金伦  记住了吗
It says Mckillen across it okay?

1117
01:27:55,281 --> 01:27:57,646
我要你拿出一大块  放在包里
I need you take break up a chunk. I need you to put it in a bag.

I'm going to come by. I'm going to pick it up tomorrow morning.

1119
01:27:59,740 --> 01:28:01,682
如果有人问你  这个怎么变轻了
If somebody asks you "Hey why is this lighter?".

1120
01:28:01,682 --> 01:28:03,262
就说  我是新手啊
Say "Hey, you know what, I'm a rookie".

1121
01:28:03,292 --> 01:28:04,631
难免出错
"I made a mistake."

1122
01:28:04,750 --> 01:28:07,393
你他妈清清白白的还拿过荣誉奖章
You're a squicky clean fucking lawyer with a Medal of Honor.

01:28:07,413 --> 01:28:09,618
没人会多问的
Nobody's going to question you, okay.

1124
01:28:10,800 --> 01:28:13,930
你得帮我  我也是身不由己
You gotta do this for me. I'm in a jam with these guys.

1125
01:28:15,879 --> 01:28:17,001
没问题
No problem.

1126
01:28:19,195 --> 01:28:21,058
好  我就知道可以指望你
Alright. I know I can count on you.

1127
01:28:21,808 --> 01:28:22,788

告诉迈克我爱他  我得走了
Tell Mike I love him. I gotta go.

1129

我要你进到证据室

1130
01:28:32,316 --> 01:28:33,696
把麦金伦的箱子拿出来
I need you to take the McKillen case out.

1131
01:28:33,806 --> 01:28:35,014
那有一公斤重  是个大箱子
It's a kilo. It's a big brick.

1132
01:28:35,014 --> 01:28:36,886
上面写着麦金伦  记住了吗
It says Mckillen across it okay?

1133
01:28:36,957 --> 01:28:39,461
我要你拿出一大块  放在包里

好吗
Alright?

1136
01:28:43,084 --> 01:28:44,872
如果有人问你  这个怎么变轻了
If somebody asks you "Hey why is this lighter?".

1137
01:28:44,872 --> 01:28:46,333
就说  我是新手啊
Say "Hey, you know what, I'm a rookie".

1138
01:28:46,364 --> 01:28:47,786
难免出错
"I made a mistake."

1139
01:28:48,417 --> 01:28:50,952
你他妈清清白白的还拿过荣誉奖章
You're a squicky clean fucking lawyer with a Medal of Honor.

你得帮我  我也是身不由己
You gotta do this for me. I'm in a jam with these guys.

没问题
No problem.

1143
01:29:05,018 --> 01:29:06,740
给内部调查科听过了吗
Shown this to I.A.?

1144
01:29:07,261 --> 01:29:08,516
当然没
Of course not.

1145
01:29:08,947 --> 01:29:10,924
给你听听更方便点
Handing it to you on a silver platter.

1146
01:29:14,922 --> 01:29:16,754
知道这意味着什么吗
Got any idea what this means?

1147
01:29:17,596 --> 01:29:18,688
真要这样做
Are you ready do it?

1148
01:29:19,940 --> 01:29:21,752
真的吗  真要这样做
Are you son? Are you really ready?

1149
01:29:22,712 --> 01:29:24,890
他们会搞死你的
Cause they're going to fucking tear you in half.

1150
01:29:26,101 --> 01:29:27,073
我要你保证
I'm going to need you're assurance

1151
01:29:27,073 --> 01:29:29,127
案子要一直跟进下去
that you're gonna follow through.

1152
01:29:30,780 --> 01:29:31,820
真的吗
Really?

1153
01:29:33,740 --> 01:29:36,259
而且我需要完全的豁免权
And I'm going to want full immunity when you do.

1154
01:29:37,201 --> 01:29:38,333
你不能就这样
You can't just walk in here

1155
01:29:38,343 --> 01:29:40,367
命令我该如何做  知道吗
and tell me what the fuck to do. You understand?

1156
01:29:40,417 --> 01:29:42,458
同时
And when you do,

1157
01:29:42,638 --> 01:29:44,327
我要当助理检察官
I want to be made assistant district attorney.

1158
01:29:44,327 --> 01:29:45,827
我有法学学位并通过了律师资格考试
I have a law degree and I passed the bar.

1159
01:29:47,910 --> 01:29:50,936
-现在没这样的职位空缺  -那弄一个
- I don't have a spot for you right now. - Make a spot.

1160
01:29:51,066 --> 01:29:52,096
我不会那样做
I won't do that.

1161
01:29:52,226 --> 01:29:54,555
我不能打个响指就让你去当助理检察官
I can't just snap my fingers and make you assistant D.A.

1162
01:29:54,555 --> 01:29:55,454
你可以拒绝
You can say no.

1163
01:29:55,594 --> 01:29:57,458
你当然可以拒绝  那么我就会走出这门
You can say no. I'll walk out this door.

1164
01:29:57,578 --> 01:29:59,942
走到报社  抖出我所知的一切
I walk over to the Gazette. I'll tell them everything I know.

1165
01:30:00,022 --> 01:30:00,754
包括这次谈话
Including this conversation.

1166
01:30:00,754 --> 01:30:01,944
别  听着  你哪都别去
You're not, listen. You're not going anywhere.

1167
01:30:01,994 --> 01:30:03,324
别  听着
Don't. Listen.

1168
01:30:03,574 --> 01:30:06,113
把它放回桌面  我他妈答应你
Put it back on the table, I'll fucking do it.

1169
01:30:08,958 --> 01:30:11,422
-三样都能做到吗  -是的
- All three things? - Alright.

1170
01:30:12,622 --> 01:30:15,300
我不能保证你能在那待多久
I'm not going to promise you how long you're going to stay there.

1171
01:30:15,460 --> 01:30:18,065
别想跟我握手
You're not going to shake my fucking hand pal.

1172
01:30:19,597 --> 01:30:21,140
我会帮你当上助理检察官
I'll make you assistant D.A.

1173
01:30:21,200 --> 01:30:23,140
但我是不会跟你握手的
I'm never going to shake your fucking hand.

1174
01:30:25,237 --> 01:30:27,532
你真是机关算尽
You're too smart for your own good.

1175
01:30:30,387 --> 01:30:32,518
到那找个好角度拍
Get right in there for a good shot.

1176
01:30:33,108 --> 01:30:36,347
警探  对于这些指控你有何回应
Detective, how do you respond to these allegations?

1177
01:30:40,054 --> 01:30:41,806
毒品  贪污  帮派
Drugs, corruption, and gangs.

1178
01:30:41,836 --> 01:30:44,954
这并非斯克奈塔第警方所作的调查
It's not an investigation by the Schenectady Police Department.

1179
01:30:44,974 --> 01:30:48,420
而是来自斯克奈塔第警方内部的调查
It's an investigation into the Schenectady Police Department.

1180
01:30:48,893 --> 01:30:51,430
今日稍早  地方检察官金库伦宣布
Earlier today, D.A. Killcullen announced

1181
01:30:51,470 --> 01:30:53,580
他所在部门将会联同联邦调查局
that his office, along with the FBI,

1182
01:30:53,580 --> 01:30:55,889
提起诉讼  而这班来自
will be handing down indictments that

1183
01:30:55,899 --> 01:30:56,740
斯克奈塔第的警官
would lead to the arrest

1184
01:30:56,740 --> 01:30:58,744
将会被依法逮捕
of these Schenectady police officers.

1185
01:30:58,764 --> 01:31:00,677
地方检察官于今日作出检控
The D.A. is making allegations today

1186
01:31:00,677 --> 01:31:03,448
警察缉捕队的职责本应是捉拿黑帮
that the Vice officers were acting like the gangs

1187
01:31:03,468 --> 01:31:05,426
但他们自身却干着黑帮的勾当
that they were suppose to be hunting.

1188
01:31:05,466 --> 01:31:08,231
德卢卡警官涉嫌窃取毒品和钱财
Officer Deluca stole drugs and money,

1189
01:31:08,231 --> 01:31:11,596
还有物证室的枪械
even guns from inside the evidence room here.

1190
01:31:12,106 --> 01:31:14,455
据称警察会将这些偷来的物证转给罪犯
Officials say that with that stolen evidence,

1191
01:31:14,455 --> 01:31:17,638
使其提高实力  制造大案
the cops paid criminals to help set up their rivals.

1192
01:31:17,638 --> 01:31:20,804
再一举歼灭  尽显警威
Which then led to those headline robbing arrests.

1193
01:31:21,544 --> 01:31:24,003
地方检察官今日也宣布了此案的关键证人
The D.A. Announced a star witness in the case today.

1194
01:31:24,113 --> 01:31:26,884
他便是警界之光  艾弗里・克罗斯
Hero cop, Avery Cross,

1195
01:31:26,884 --> 01:31:29,479
在不到1年前  他在执勤过程中
who less than a year ago was shot in the line of duty

1196
01:31:29,479 --> 01:31:30,812
为解救两位居民
while trying to save two Schenectady residents

1197
01:31:30,812 --> 01:31:33,102
不幸被摩托大盗给射伤
from the alledged Moto Bandit.

1198
01:31:33,232 --> 01:31:34,840
杰西卡・莱顿来自斯克奈塔第的报道
In Schenectady, I'm Jessica Layton,

1199
01:31:34,840 --> 01:31:36,752
-13新闻频道  -没事的
- News Channel 13. - It's going to be alright.

1200
01:31:36,782 --> 01:31:38,075
谢谢杰西  此案是本地区有史以来
Thanks Jess. It's the largest case

1201
01:31:38,075 --> 01:31:40,549
最大的诈骗案
of fraud this region has seen.

1202
01:31:48,594 --> 01:31:53,888
15 年 后

1203
01:32:30,152 --> 01:32:31,716
当我还是个孩子时
You know when I was a kid,

1204
01:32:31,716 --> 01:32:35,243
看到穿着法官袍的父亲
I used to look at my Dad dressed in judge's robes

1205
01:32:35,243 --> 01:32:38,780
觉得他就跟超人一样
and I used to think that my father was a superhero.

1206
01:32:39,822 --> 01:32:42,224
这么说一点都不为过
And I don't think I was far off.

1207
01:32:42,704 --> 01:32:44,383
他具备法官的高尚品质
He had that quality that

1208
01:32:44,383 --> 01:32:47,886
有着无限的怜悯之心
judges have where they have tremendous compassion.

1209
01:32:48,257 --> 01:32:51,162
但同时也铁面无私
But they are also ferocious at the same time.

1210
01:32:51,572 --> 01:32:53,392
不畏强权
He wasn't afraid of making enemies.

1211
01:32:53,552 --> 01:32:55,931
也因此结交了许多朋友
I think that's probably why he had so many friends.

1212
01:32:57,173 --> 01:32:59,617
在他昏迷之际  我告诉他
I had the chance right before he fell into the coma to tell him that

1213
01:32:59,667 --> 01:33:02,070
我将为他去竞选司法部长
I was dedicating my run for Attorney General to him.

1214
01:33:03,010 --> 01:33:09,996
他摇摇头  我不解其意
And he shook his head no and I didn't understand why.

1215
01:33:11,638 --> 01:33:15,736
我凑上前  只听见他轻声对我说
So I leaned in close that he can whisper and he said to me,

1216
01:33:16,147 --> 01:33:18,411
竞选只是过程  赢才是目的
"I'll take the win, not the run."

1217
01:33:21,856 --> 01:33:23,776
这就是我的父亲  这就是阿尔
That was my dad. That was Al.

1218

我们得谈谈AJ

他想跟你住一块
He wants to come and live with you.

1225
01:33:59,345 --> 01:34:01,288
为这事他一直没完没了

真的吗
Really?

1227
01:34:06,247 --> 01:34:10,771
这也不失为一个好建议
I guess that's a good idea at some point.

1228

我觉得他需要你
I think he needs you.

1229
01:34:12,472 --> 01:34:14,531
他不跟你住一块的话
I think if he doesn't come and live with you,

1230
01:34:14,531 --> 01:34:16,592
就真要误入歧途了
he's going to completely go off the rails.

我又不知道他喜好
I don't know what he likes or...

1236
01:34:26,840 --> 01:34:29,315
这对他或是任何人都没好处

干嘛非得挑这时候
Why, why, why are you doing this right now?

1242

以及与地方检察官的商讨

1412
01:44:12,508 --> 01:44:13,947
可公诉人
But I'm getting the impression

1413
01:44:13,947 --> 01:44:15,756
则更倾向于
from the Prosecutor that they may be willing

1414
01:44:15,786 --> 01:44:17,910
将他定为轻罪
to reduce it today to a misdemeanor.

1415
01:44:17,990 --> 01:44:20,284
在本次案件当中
The offer on his particular case

1416
01:44:20,344 --> 01:44:23,036

would be time served, which is the day he spent in jail.

并罚款
And a fine.

1418

就是这样

01:51:28,939 --> 01:51:30,482
过去我和你爸爸聊天的时候
You are standing right where

1505
01:51:30,482 --> 01:51:32,924
他总是站在你现在站的这个位置
your dad used to stand when we used to talk.

1506
01:51:34,243 --> 01:51:36,684
你爸爸是个好人

1510
01:51:46,011 --> 01:51:49,146
收下吧  他一定希望你收下这副眼镜
You keep those. He would have wanted you to have them.

1511
01:51:49,676 --> 01:51:50,998
他擅长什么呢
Was he good at anything?

1512
01:51:51,118 --> 01:51:53,210
他是我这辈子见过的
Yeah, he was the best motorcycle rider

1513
01:51:53,210 --> 01:51:54,838
最棒的摩托车手
I've ever seen in my life.

1514
01:51:55,168 --> 01:51:55,919

1521
01:52:13,156 --> 01:52:15,044
你还留着他的车子吗

1522
01:52:19,190 --> 01:52:22,044
不  他的车不在了
No, his bike is gone.

1523
01:52:23,604 --> 01:52:25,202
被警察没收了
Police took it.

1524
01:52:26,133 --> 01:52:27,966
我觉得他们应该把它销毁了
I think they cut it up.

1525
01:52:29,425 --> 01:52:31,146
他们恨死你爸爸了

- Why don't you put the glasses on? - Nah.

1530
01:52:47,727 --> 01:52:51,142
他一定是想把这留给你的
For sure, he would have said they were left there for you.

1531

1643
02:08:22,591 --> 02:08:24,091
你究竟把我儿子怎么了
What did you do to my son?

1644
02:08:24,191 --> 02:08:26,301
你给我跪下

1648
02:08:46,007 --> 02:08:48,100
这他妈不关你儿子的事
This isn't about your fucking son.

1649
02:09:19,051 --> 02:09:20,963
对不起  詹森

对不起
I'm sorry.

1651
02:11:02,791 --> 02:11:04,371
一年多来
It was a tight race for over a year

1652
02:11:04,371 --> 02:11:07,252
克罗斯和凯勒曼进行了激烈的角逐
between Cross and Kellerman

1653
02:11:07,292 --> 02:11:09,385
在过去的一个月里  许多传闻
and then unprecedented events over the last month

1654
02:11:09,385 --> 02:11:12,359
对克罗斯的选举产生了不少负面影响
will lead to threaten Cross's election bid.

1655
02:11:12,399 --> 02:11:15,159

1656

1657
02:11:18,702 --> 02:11:22,087
他的儿子也因脑震荡住院观察

1658
02:11:22,147 --> 02:11:25,506
显然  克罗斯现在已经恢复竞选

1659
02:11:25,546 --> 02:11:27,359
正如我们所见

1666
02:11:48,686 --> 02:11:53,671
女士们  先生们  请允许我荣幸地
