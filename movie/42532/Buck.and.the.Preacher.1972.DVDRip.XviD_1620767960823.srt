1
00:04:08,129 --> 00:04:12,839
Your land runs 1000 rods to the left
of that big tree, then it follows the creek.
你的土地向左转1000杆
那棵大树，然后沿着小溪走。
2
00:04:13,009 --> 00:04:16,968
- You keep this paper good, now.
- You want to stay with us a spell?

3
00:04:17,529 --> 00:04:19,759
Sure be obliged.

4
00:04:20,409 --> 00:04:21,808
Thank you.

5
00:04:32,529 --> 00:04:33,882
Good luck.

6
00:07:42,529 --> 00:07:44,884
Now you listen to me, you hear?

7
00:07:45,049 --> 00:07:47,688
You people from Louisiana,
ain't you?

8
00:07:48,089 --> 00:07:52,241
Well, there's plenty of work for you back
there: Chopping cotton, cutting cane.

9
00:07:52,809 --> 00:07:54,959
Good jobs with people who know you.

10
00:07:55,129 --> 00:07:57,802
You was born there.
You was raised there.

11
00:07:57,969 --> 00:08:01,405
You don't belong out here.
You couldn't last the winter.

12
00:08:01,569 --> 00:08:03,605
You ain't got no place to live.

13
00:08:03,769 --> 00:08:06,363
No farm tools, no sheep.

14
00:08:06,529 --> 00:08:10,238
So you're gonna turn around
and go home.

15
00:08:11,969 --> 00:08:14,005
Hey, you.

16
00:08:14,729 --> 00:08:16,208
Come here.

17
00:08:23,489 --> 00:08:24,717
Where's Buck?

18
00:08:26,529 --> 00:08:29,839
I'm looking for your wagonmaster,
name of Buck.

19
00:08:32,249 --> 00:08:34,240
No Buck here.

20
00:08:35,889 --> 00:08:37,641
Don't know nobody named Buck.

21
00:08:37,849 --> 00:08:40,568
He's the one that brought
you here, isn't he?

22
00:08:40,729 --> 00:08:44,517
So where'd he go? Where'd you hire him,
and where's he staying?

23
00:08:45,129 --> 00:08:47,279
He had a name something else.

24
00:08:47,449 --> 00:08:50,009
Ain't no Buck!

25
00:08:50,609 --> 00:08:52,201
Where's Buck?

26
00:10:42,569 --> 00:10:44,764
He's leery, Floyd.

27
00:10:45,649 --> 00:10:48,880
You hear me. You're gonna go outside
and wave to your old man.

28
00:10:49,049 --> 00:10:53,201
If you holler anything, I'll kill
everything around here that moves.

29
00:10:53,369 --> 00:10:54,802
Everything.

30
00:13:54,809 --> 00:13:57,039
Get them horses! Floyd!

31
00:13:58,529 --> 00:14:00,042
Get on!

32
00:16:52,209 --> 00:16:54,245
Well, how do?

33
00:16:58,329 --> 00:17:00,001
I need a horse.

34
00:17:00,169 --> 00:17:02,842
- I can see that.
- I'll pay you $20.

35
00:17:03,009 --> 00:17:05,159
That's a handsome price.

36
00:17:07,009 --> 00:17:09,443
But I ain't in
the horse-trading business, brother.

37
00:17:09,609 --> 00:17:11,645
I got to travel fast.

38
00:17:11,809 --> 00:17:15,324
I sure do wish I could be
of service to you, but...

39
00:17:15,489 --> 00:17:19,198
- I don't want to have to take him.
- Who says you have to?

40
00:17:20,209 --> 00:17:21,927
Hold it.

41
00:17:22,569 --> 00:17:27,324
You got any objection if I get into my
drawers? Or do you need them too?

42
00:17:50,369 --> 00:17:53,281
Just getting my boots, brother.
Just getting my boots.

43
00:18:09,489 --> 00:18:12,128
- You're eating my rabbit.
- What you doing out here?

44
00:18:13,889 --> 00:18:16,244
Getting into my drawers.

45
00:18:47,249 --> 00:18:49,319
- You gonna take my horse?
- Drop your drawers.

46
00:18:49,489 --> 00:18:51,127
- Wait a damn minute!
- Drop them!

47
00:18:53,649 --> 00:18:55,560
Damn!

48
00:19:09,249 --> 00:19:11,922
You forgot your coffee!

49
00:19:48,969 --> 00:19:52,757
There's two mountains
pointing up to the sky.

50
00:19:52,929 --> 00:19:55,489
Beyond that, there's a valley.

51
00:19:55,649 --> 00:19:58,607
Green with cool water.

52
00:19:58,769 --> 00:20:00,885
I can see it. It's there.

53
00:20:01,049 --> 00:20:03,358
Call it Colorado.

54
00:20:03,849 --> 00:20:05,805
But don't turn back.

55
00:20:05,969 --> 00:20:08,802
That valley is going to be our home.

56
00:20:17,889 --> 00:20:19,880
We're going on.

57
00:20:28,969 --> 00:20:30,243
All right.

58
00:20:30,409 --> 00:20:34,766
Nightriders hit Pappy Whitlock
and his people here two weeks ago.

59
00:20:34,929 --> 00:20:38,160
Then they burned a wagon train
meeting me at Sulphur Flats.

60
00:20:38,329 --> 00:20:40,081
Right here.

61
00:20:40,649 --> 00:20:43,083
Then they got the Deaf Smith County
people...

62
00:20:43,249 --> 00:20:45,604
...at the water hole this side of
Clay Town.

63
00:20:46,249 --> 00:20:47,887
They're heading this way.

64
00:20:48,049 --> 00:20:50,768
You've got to move out tonight.

65
00:22:10,089 --> 00:22:11,283
Morning, sir.

66
00:22:11,449 --> 00:22:14,088
Could you get me a bottle
of whiskey out here?

67
00:22:14,249 --> 00:22:15,602
You could go inside.

68
00:22:15,769 --> 00:22:20,479
My man, good liquor is best enjoyed
under the open firmament.

69
00:22:21,129 --> 00:22:24,439
Anyways, my heart yearneth
for the dusky company...

70
00:22:24,609 --> 00:22:26,486
...of my own emancipated people.

71
00:22:28,129 --> 00:22:30,324
Where are the coloured folks?
Where do you live?

72
00:22:30,489 --> 00:22:33,959
With my mammy and the rest
at Mr. Logan's place, 10 miles out.

73
00:22:34,129 --> 00:22:37,565
- Do all the coloured live there?
- No, sir. We just passing through.

74
00:22:37,729 --> 00:22:40,641
We made a crop for Mr. Logan.

75
00:22:40,809 --> 00:22:42,322
Boy!

76
00:22:43,609 --> 00:22:44,678
The whiskey, son.

77
00:22:44,849 --> 00:22:47,044
Forty cents a bottle, cash money.

78
00:22:54,169 --> 00:22:55,921
Oh, here.

79
00:25:04,849 --> 00:25:07,158
Where'd you get that horse?

80
00:25:07,609 --> 00:25:09,964
It was delivered to me
in the wilderness.

81
00:25:10,129 --> 00:25:12,199
Where's the man who rode that horse?

82
00:25:12,369 --> 00:25:15,406
- I don't know.
- What do you mean, you don't know?

83
00:25:16,249 --> 00:25:18,479
A man cometh and a man goeth.

84
00:25:18,649 --> 00:25:21,163
In this wilderness,
who shall know but the Lord?

85
00:25:21,609 --> 00:25:22,928
Don't play with me.

86
00:25:24,889 --> 00:25:27,244
There's nobody back there,
Uncle Beau.

87
00:25:27,409 --> 00:25:28,728
Where's Buck?

88
00:25:28,889 --> 00:25:31,278
- Is that his name? Buck?
- Where is he?

89
00:25:35,569 --> 00:25:38,879
Mister, I'm looking for that miserable...

90
00:25:39,049 --> 00:25:42,200
...no-good, low-down sinner myself.

91
00:25:42,369 --> 00:25:45,088
And when I find him,
I'll smite him hip and thigh.

92
00:25:45,249 --> 00:25:49,037
- How come you got his horse?
- On account of he stole mine.

93
00:25:49,209 --> 00:25:51,928
- And left me out there to perish.
- He's lying.

94
00:25:52,849 --> 00:25:55,886
As God is my judge!
I swear on this Bible!

95
00:25:57,129 --> 00:25:58,528
What you doing out here?

96
00:25:59,609 --> 00:26:02,965
Wandering as the Lord wills,
spreading the word of the gospel.

97
00:26:03,129 --> 00:26:05,643
I'm doing like you gentlemen,
I'm fighting sin.

98
00:26:05,809 --> 00:26:10,599
You hear me. We want this Buck.
We want him bad.

99
00:26:10,769 --> 00:26:14,887
You see him,
you tell us where he is...

100
00:26:15,889 --> 00:26:19,279
...there's $500 for you.

101
00:26:19,449 --> 00:26:21,041
Can you remember that?

102
00:26:21,209 --> 00:26:24,087
Five hundred dollars?

103
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:26,524
That's easy to remember.

104
00:26:27,409 --> 00:26:31,402
I don't suppose for that kind of money
you particular whether he dead or alive?

105
00:26:31,569 --> 00:26:32,558
Either.

106
00:26:32,729 --> 00:26:36,165
And if in my search for this sinner,
I finds him...

107
00:26:36,329 --> 00:26:38,718
...tell me, where do
I finds you gentlemens?

108
00:26:38,889 --> 00:26:42,359
Copper Springs. Ask for Deshay.

109
00:26:42,529 --> 00:26:45,487
Deshay. Mr. Deshay.

110
00:26:46,809 --> 00:26:51,564
So you a wandering preacher
ministering to your people out here?

111
00:26:51,729 --> 00:26:53,321
Yes, sir.

112
00:26:53,489 --> 00:26:56,959
Though they's few and far between,
the need for salvation is everywhere.

113
00:26:57,129 --> 00:26:59,120
Best thing you can tell them:

114
00:26:59,729 --> 00:27:03,085
Turn around and go back home.

115
00:27:03,729 --> 00:27:06,243
"Turn around and go back home."

116
00:27:35,129 --> 00:27:37,120
Young man!

117
00:27:45,249 --> 00:27:47,717
- Pleasant afternoon.
- Yes, sir.

118
00:27:47,889 --> 00:27:49,641
You walk home every day?

119
00:27:49,809 --> 00:27:52,164
No, sir. I sleeps under the bar.

120
00:27:52,329 --> 00:27:56,368
They finished with the crop for Mr. Logan,
and they going to have pig and chicken.

121
00:27:56,529 --> 00:27:58,520
That a fact? Who's your preacher?

122
00:27:58,689 --> 00:28:02,238
- We ain't got none.
- Then who gives thanks to the Lord?

123
00:28:02,409 --> 00:28:05,560
This old Uncle Cudjo.
He's more conjurer than preacher.

124
00:28:05,729 --> 00:28:07,526
That a fact?

125
00:28:07,689 --> 00:28:11,284
May I prevail upon you
to share my beast of burden?

126
00:28:11,929 --> 00:28:13,885
The horse, son.

127
00:28:35,129 --> 00:28:37,006
Who's that with Toby?

128
00:28:57,129 --> 00:28:58,642
Blessings in his name.

129
00:28:58,809 --> 00:29:03,644
I'm the Reverend Willis Oakes Rutherford
of the Holiness Persuasion Church.

130
00:29:03,809 --> 00:29:07,324
- Where you from, reverend?
- Sunflower County, Mississippi mostly.

131
00:29:07,489 --> 00:29:09,559
And whereabouts you heading?

132
00:29:09,729 --> 00:29:14,200
In the vastness of God's earth,
every corner challenges my ministry.

133
00:29:14,369 --> 00:29:16,803
I'm headed there,
and I could be there tomorrow.

134
00:29:18,049 --> 00:29:22,964
- Where you from, brother?
- We all from St. Ann Parish, Louisiana.

135
00:29:23,849 --> 00:29:25,328
My name is Kingston.

136
00:29:25,489 --> 00:29:27,639
Pleased to meet you, Brother Kingston.

137
00:29:27,809 --> 00:29:30,164
Well, well. Sister.

138
00:29:30,329 --> 00:29:31,648
Reverend.

139
00:29:31,809 --> 00:29:35,438
- You've come a long way. A long way.
- And we going further yet.

140
00:29:36,329 --> 00:29:40,083
I do admire to meet
a good Christian congregation.

141
00:29:43,609 --> 00:29:44,598
Yes.

142
00:29:44,769 --> 00:29:47,602
And if you'll permit me...

143
00:29:47,889 --> 00:29:49,720
After a bit of supper...

144
00:29:50,489 --> 00:29:54,243
...I would like to offer a prayer
for your safe guidance here...

145
00:29:54,409 --> 00:29:57,526
...beneath the wonders
of God's creation.

146
00:30:38,809 --> 00:30:40,208
How'd you find me?

147
00:30:40,369 --> 00:30:42,200
I asked your horse.

148
00:30:44,729 --> 00:30:46,845
It's all right. It ain't nothing.

149
00:30:48,769 --> 00:30:53,684
- What's on your mind?
- My horse, amongst other things.

150
00:30:53,849 --> 00:30:56,841
You'll get your horse.
What are you doing round here?

151
00:30:57,009 --> 00:30:59,318
Just spreading the sweet word
of the gospel.

152
00:31:00,689 --> 00:31:02,327
You a preacher?

153
00:31:02,489 --> 00:31:04,366
The Reverend
Willis Oakes Rutherford...

154
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:09,557
...of the high and low order
of the Holiness Persuasion Church.

155
00:31:10,689 --> 00:31:14,125
You can take supper here, reverend.
That'll square for the rabbit.

156
00:31:14,289 --> 00:31:16,962
You can rest a while,
and then you move on.

157
00:31:17,129 --> 00:31:18,482
Buck.

158
00:31:25,329 --> 00:31:29,288
Fifty, 60, 70, 80, 90.

159
00:31:29,449 --> 00:31:32,168
Four hundred, 410, 420.

160
00:31:32,369 --> 00:31:34,519
Four mules, a litter of pigs.

161
00:31:34,729 --> 00:31:37,118
Right on the barrelhead,
fair and square.

162
00:31:37,289 --> 00:31:38,404
That's right.

163
00:31:41,729 --> 00:31:45,768
If you folks want to stay and plant
another crop, we'll make the same deal.

164
00:31:46,569 --> 00:31:50,881
No. Expect we better be moving on.
But much obliged to you anyway, sir.

165
00:31:51,049 --> 00:31:52,368
All right.

166
00:33:45,569 --> 00:33:47,446
Which way you riding,
Preacher?

167
00:33:47,609 --> 00:33:50,077
I've not exactly
settled my mind yet.

168
00:33:50,249 --> 00:33:53,924
You've got three possibilities:
North, south or east.

169
00:33:54,089 --> 00:33:55,841
- What happened to west?
- We going west.

170
00:33:56,009 --> 00:33:59,638
There's a lot of room out there.
It's not elbow to elbow out that way.

171
00:33:59,849 --> 00:34:02,682
You've got your horse.
Don't press your luck.

172
00:34:02,889 --> 00:34:05,039
Tell me something.
What you got against me?

173
00:34:05,209 --> 00:34:08,963
Nothing. But it's a fool farmer let
the weasel travel in the chicken coop.

174
00:34:09,129 --> 00:34:13,919
I know an Eastman when I see one.
These people ain't for picking.

175
00:34:14,089 --> 00:34:17,081
I told you, I ain't no Eastman.
I'm a preacher.

176
00:34:32,929 --> 00:34:38,083
On the other hand, you could say
it's a might stuffy out there to the west.

177
00:34:39,809 --> 00:34:41,561
Amen, brother.

178
00:34:43,369 --> 00:34:45,758
Fivefold, amen.

179
00:35:20,969 --> 00:35:23,278
- Double your watch tonight, hear?
- I'll do that.

180
00:35:23,449 --> 00:35:25,246
I'll be back tomorrow by sundown.

181
00:35:25,409 --> 00:35:29,448
- You can find water holes on the map?
- Yeah, they're plain.

182
00:36:46,849 --> 00:36:48,646
Indians!

183
00:36:48,809 --> 00:36:50,879
Buck, Indians!

184
00:36:56,209 --> 00:36:58,484
- What are you doing?
- Get off your horse.

185
00:36:58,689 --> 00:37:01,362
- Have you looked behind you recent?
- Get down!

186
00:37:11,209 --> 00:37:12,961
Don't tell me you took to praying.

187
00:37:13,169 --> 00:37:18,687
Preacher, you do as I say.
Hunker down and keep your mouth shut.

188
00:37:48,609 --> 00:37:50,088
Sweet Jesus.

189
00:37:55,849 --> 00:37:58,044
Lord of mercy, look at that.

190
00:37:58,209 --> 00:38:00,882
If you don't be quiet,
you're gonna be dead.

191
00:38:04,489 --> 00:38:06,081
- Do you have good health?
- Yes.

192
00:38:06,249 --> 00:38:08,479
- Things go well?
- Some things, some days.

193
00:38:09,889 --> 00:38:11,641
What do you want, sergeant?

194
00:38:11,849 --> 00:38:13,885
I got a wagon train coming through.

195
00:38:16,409 --> 00:38:19,048
Forty head of people,
not including children.

196
00:38:19,209 --> 00:38:21,165
- What kind of people?
- Black.

197
00:38:21,369 --> 00:38:24,167
I want them to get through safe
to the pass north...

198
00:38:24,329 --> 00:38:26,126
...on the west bank of the Pecos.

199
00:38:46,889 --> 00:38:49,039
You have five days to pass.

200
00:38:49,209 --> 00:38:51,643
They got sorry horses
and worn-out mules.

201
00:38:52,089 --> 00:38:53,408
Five days.

202
00:38:55,289 --> 00:38:56,438
All right.

203
00:38:56,649 --> 00:38:58,719
Ten dollars each one.

204
00:38:58,889 --> 00:39:01,278
I was thinking on $6.

205
00:39:02,689 --> 00:39:03,963
Eight.

206
00:39:05,529 --> 00:39:10,080
They've gotta live through the winter,
and they got children. They ain't worth 8.

207
00:39:16,929 --> 00:39:18,840
Eight. Children nothing.

208
00:39:19,009 --> 00:39:22,046
They gonna need food.
I can get by if I kill three buffalo.

209
00:39:32,209 --> 00:39:33,961
One buffalo.

210
00:39:58,569 --> 00:40:02,687
My husband say two buffalo,
if you must.

211
00:40:02,849 --> 00:40:04,805
Thank you.

212
00:40:37,769 --> 00:40:41,728
Brother, you a man of many parts. How
do you know how to deal with Indians?

213
00:40:41,929 --> 00:40:45,638
- What were you tracking me for?
- Me?

214
00:40:45,809 --> 00:40:47,401
Fact is, I got lost.

215
00:40:47,609 --> 00:40:52,239
I praise God I found your tracks, or I
might've perished out here like a heathen.

216
00:42:16,169 --> 00:42:17,841
Toby?

217
00:44:32,049 --> 00:44:33,277
God!

218
00:44:52,649 --> 00:44:56,198
Come on, now. Yeah, that's good.

219
00:44:56,369 --> 00:44:58,087
Okay. It's all right now.

220
00:45:04,609 --> 00:45:06,679
Get me some water.

221
00:45:17,929 --> 00:45:20,807
And the money's gone. All $1400.

222
00:45:20,969 --> 00:45:24,882
How we gonna live through the winter?
Where we gonna get food, seed?

223
00:45:25,049 --> 00:45:27,279
We done been turned around.

224
00:45:28,969 --> 00:45:32,245
Penny. Suzanna.
Tom DeCooper.

225
00:45:32,889 --> 00:45:34,402
Joseph.

226
00:45:35,649 --> 00:45:38,686
Rachel and Toby.
All dead.

227
00:45:39,969 --> 00:45:43,803
But the valley is there.

228
00:45:43,969 --> 00:45:46,085
Green and wild.

229
00:45:48,649 --> 00:45:49,923
It's there.

230
00:46:00,169 --> 00:46:02,842
We gonna go on.

231
00:46:04,369 --> 00:46:07,281
You ain't got no supplies, no food.

232
00:46:07,449 --> 00:46:10,282
You can't make it
through the winter.

233
00:46:10,449 --> 00:46:13,122
Then we dies in the snow.

234
00:46:18,049 --> 00:46:21,724
No, you ain't gonna die in the snow.

235
00:46:25,409 --> 00:46:28,879
The old man said we're going on?
Then by God, we're going.

236
00:46:29,049 --> 00:46:32,121
But we ain't got the money
to pay what we owe you.

237
00:46:32,289 --> 00:46:35,520
Don't matter. You paid for safe passage
through the Indian land.

238
00:46:35,689 --> 00:46:40,001
You'll cross north of the salt wells.
You only got five days to pass.

239
00:46:40,169 --> 00:46:43,639
I'll find you somewhere
north of the Pecos.

240
00:46:49,089 --> 00:46:51,523
Ain't nothing left here for you,
Eastman.

241
00:46:51,689 --> 00:46:54,840
You can come or go.
It don't matter.

242
00:47:05,929 --> 00:47:09,319
You ever hear of Copper Springs?
Ten riders, boss named Deshay.

243
00:47:09,489 --> 00:47:10,763
How you know?

244
00:47:10,929 --> 00:47:13,727
They catched me with your horse
at Frenchman's Ford.

245
00:47:13,889 --> 00:47:16,722
They asked a lot of mean questions.
Now I know why.

246
00:47:17,369 --> 00:47:20,520
- Copper Springs?
- I heard them say they holes up there.

247
00:47:20,689 --> 00:47:23,157
And I remember every one
of them faces.

248
00:48:03,929 --> 00:48:07,126
- Deshay, hold up a minute.
- Ollie, how are things?

249
00:48:07,329 --> 00:48:08,921
I wanna talk to you.

250
00:48:09,089 --> 00:48:12,764
Delighted.
Floyd, get me a bourbon.

251
00:48:14,129 --> 00:48:17,041
You ran into a couple
of wagon trains out yonder.

252
00:48:17,209 --> 00:48:19,723
We just had a little talk, is all.

253
00:48:19,889 --> 00:48:21,447
You listen to me, Deshay.

254
00:48:21,649 --> 00:48:26,404
Nobody's gonna be gunned downed or
burned out here as long as I have a say.

255
00:48:26,569 --> 00:48:28,480
That goes for the coloureds too.

256
00:48:28,649 --> 00:48:33,404
Ollie, I just rode in to pick up my mail
and spend a little time at Esther's.

257
00:48:33,609 --> 00:48:35,600
Never mind. I'm telling you.

258
00:48:35,769 --> 00:48:39,125
Those folks can come and go
as they like. That's the law.

259
00:48:39,289 --> 00:48:43,168
Sheriff, you got any official complaint
against me and my boys?

260
00:48:45,009 --> 00:48:47,569
We are bona fide labour recruiters...

261
00:48:47,729 --> 00:48:50,926
...employed by the Delta Planters
Association in Louisiana.

262
00:48:51,089 --> 00:48:55,640
There's a whole way of life back there.
It's going down the drain.

263
00:48:55,809 --> 00:48:57,925
We don't aim to see it
frittered away.

264
00:48:58,409 --> 00:49:03,608
I don't care who you're working for. This
ain't Louisiana. You walk soft in my town.

265
00:50:04,089 --> 00:50:07,684
That's them.
Deshay is the one with the hat on.

266
00:50:07,849 --> 00:50:10,079
There's only eight of them in there.

267
00:50:10,249 --> 00:50:12,763
The other two are in the saloon.

268
00:50:13,089 --> 00:50:15,319
You studying on taking eight
in one gulp?

269
00:50:15,489 --> 00:50:18,686
Five. Three of them busy upstairs.

270
00:50:18,849 --> 00:50:21,522
Yeah, but they ain't tied down forever.

271
00:50:21,689 --> 00:50:24,249
I just gotta catch them off guard.

272
00:50:26,409 --> 00:50:28,525
Let me talk to them.

273
00:50:30,049 --> 00:50:32,119
You'll catch them off guard.

274
00:50:42,729 --> 00:50:45,766
Blessings on this house!

275
00:50:46,249 --> 00:50:50,606
I am Rev. Willis Oakes Rutherford
of the Holiness Persuasion Church.

276
00:50:50,809 --> 00:50:52,561
Get the hell out of here!

277
00:50:52,729 --> 00:50:56,199
You do recollect we've encountered
each other previous?

278
00:50:59,449 --> 00:51:01,007
- It's that old preacher.
- Yes!

279
00:51:01,209 --> 00:51:03,564
I run a selective house.
This ain't New Orleans.

280
00:51:03,769 --> 00:51:04,963
Shut up.

281
00:51:06,529 --> 00:51:09,043
- What you want?
- Well, sir...

282
00:51:09,209 --> 00:51:14,966
You do recall there was an old silly you
was interested in by the name of Buck?

283
00:51:17,009 --> 00:51:18,408
You know where he is?

284
00:51:18,849 --> 00:51:21,488
They have eyes that see not
until they are open!

285
00:51:21,689 --> 00:51:24,123
Don't trifle with me.

286
00:51:24,289 --> 00:51:26,405
I ain't trifling, sir.

287
00:51:26,569 --> 00:51:30,960
But I do seem to remember
that there was a sum mentioned.

288
00:51:31,129 --> 00:51:34,246
- Five hundred dollars to be exact.
- Where is he?

289
00:51:34,409 --> 00:51:39,244
Yea, though he flees as a shadow,
yet will I lead thee to him but for $500.

290
00:51:39,449 --> 00:51:41,883
Look, I ain't gonna bargain with you.

291
00:51:42,049 --> 00:51:45,928
You tell us where he's at,
and maybe we'll talk about money.

292
00:51:46,129 --> 00:51:48,438
Get him out of my house!
I've got a reputation.

293
00:51:48,649 --> 00:51:52,005
Thy suffers that woman Jezebel,
who calleth herself a prophetess...

294
00:51:52,169 --> 00:51:55,445
...to teach and to seduce my servants
into fornication.

295
00:51:55,609 --> 00:51:56,928
Revelation, Chapter 2.

296
00:51:57,129 --> 00:51:59,245
What the hell is he doing here?

297
00:51:59,409 --> 00:52:00,398
He's a-preaching.

298
00:52:00,609 --> 00:52:03,726
That's right, brother, I'm preaching.
And my text is fornication.

299
00:52:03,889 --> 00:52:07,928
He that committeth fornication, sinneth
against his own body. Corinthians 1.

300
00:52:08,129 --> 00:52:10,245
That's you, Esther!

301
00:52:10,449 --> 00:52:12,121
That's you, Esther!

302
00:52:12,289 --> 00:52:14,757
Fornication!
That's the way to ruination.

303
00:52:14,929 --> 00:52:17,648
Fornication. That's the way
they's taught the nation.

304
00:52:19,049 --> 00:52:21,927
You keep up that fornicating,
I'll take you to ruination.

305
00:52:25,489 --> 00:52:29,687
Rich man marries, him abate.
Poor man, he just fornicates. Yes, sir.

306
00:52:35,249 --> 00:52:39,640
He's coming, and he's waiting.
He's got no time for fornicating.

307
00:52:43,929 --> 00:52:46,124
I'm Buck.

308
00:53:13,249 --> 00:53:16,321
I put my faith in the Good Book.

309
00:54:27,849 --> 00:54:30,238
Ain't no more than $100 here.

310
00:54:30,409 --> 00:54:32,718
I got about 30.

311
00:54:40,729 --> 00:54:43,926
Where's the money?
Where is it?

312
00:54:57,369 --> 00:54:59,485
- The money!
- They're coming, Buck!

313
00:55:00,369 --> 00:55:02,678
I'm talking to you. Where is it?

314
00:55:02,849 --> 00:55:05,079
Come on, Buck, we've got to move!

315
00:55:16,289 --> 00:55:18,325
Come on, Preacher.

316
00:55:18,489 --> 00:55:20,400
Stick to thine, Jesus.

317
00:56:46,169 --> 00:56:48,239
Will you hurry up?

318
00:56:59,129 --> 00:57:02,326
Are they gonna track us
through four miles of sheep dip?

319
00:57:02,529 --> 00:57:06,647
They don't have to. They know where
I've got to go. They've been there before.

320
00:57:07,369 --> 00:57:11,157
$157! They drunk up and screwed away
more than $1000!

321
00:57:12,849 --> 00:57:15,079
That's a lot of drinking.

322
00:57:16,769 --> 00:57:18,964
And they didn't even have my 500.

323
00:57:19,889 --> 00:57:21,288
What 500?

324
00:57:22,449 --> 00:57:25,247
What they was gonna pay me
to deliver you.

325
00:57:29,369 --> 00:57:31,325
Well, I'm here, ain't I?

326
00:57:31,489 --> 00:57:33,684
And they's dead, ain't they?

327
00:57:41,529 --> 00:57:42,882
Yeah.

328
00:58:36,129 --> 00:58:38,563
Buck. Jesus!

329
00:58:41,969 --> 00:58:43,288
You all right?

330
00:58:43,489 --> 00:58:45,605
I ran to Anne Pennybegger's.
She took me in.

331
00:58:45,769 --> 00:58:49,444
- They didn't hurt you none?
- Cuff me on the head some. That's all.

332
00:58:53,849 --> 00:58:56,363
They hit the St. Ann Parish people.

333
00:58:56,529 --> 00:58:59,601
They killed some,
and they burned them out.

334
00:58:59,809 --> 00:59:02,004
- You better rest.
- I ain't got no time.

335
00:59:02,169 --> 00:59:05,047
- I didn't know if you was alive or dead.
- I couldn't come back.

336
00:59:05,209 --> 00:59:08,281
- They could've been waiting.
- I know.

337
00:59:13,729 --> 00:59:15,765
Horses are in the thicket.

338
00:59:18,089 --> 00:59:21,047
That's Ruth. Ruth, this is Preacher.

339
00:59:23,769 --> 00:59:25,919
Your servant, ma'am.

340
00:59:27,889 --> 00:59:30,449
Y'all sit down.
I'll get you something to eat.

341
00:59:46,089 --> 00:59:47,920
Where can we get horses
around here?

342
00:59:48,089 --> 00:59:49,886
Elias Pennybegger has horses.

343
00:59:50,089 --> 00:59:52,557
Don't worry. We can trust them.
She's my friend.

344
00:59:56,209 --> 00:59:59,406
- How many horses?
- At least one for you.

345
01:00:00,889 --> 01:00:03,244
They've been here once.
They can come again.

346
01:00:03,409 --> 01:00:07,322
- They still after you?
- Not all of them. Some dead.

347
01:00:07,489 --> 01:00:10,003
Eight to be exact.

348
01:00:10,929 --> 01:00:13,079
We going north like we said,
to Canada?

349
01:00:13,649 --> 01:00:17,562
No, we can't. Not yet.

350
01:00:18,049 --> 01:00:19,926
Well, why not?

351
01:00:20,889 --> 01:00:22,720
Where we going?

352
01:00:23,169 --> 01:00:27,208
You done what you could in this country,
and it all end on fire, in the grave.

353
01:00:27,369 --> 01:00:29,883
I ain't gonna live in this land no more.
You hear me?

354
01:00:30,089 --> 01:00:31,568
The war ain't changed nothing.

355
01:00:31,969 --> 01:00:36,201
It's like a poison soaked
into the ground.

356
01:00:36,369 --> 01:00:40,078
They ain't gonna give us nothing.
Not no 40 acres and no mule.

357
01:00:40,249 --> 01:00:42,126
And not freedom, neither.

358
01:00:42,289 --> 01:00:46,043
It's like a poison
soaked into the ground.

359
01:00:52,089 --> 01:00:56,924
The time is going. I don't wanna spend
my life washing other people's clothes.

360
01:00:57,089 --> 01:01:00,161
I wanna live somewhere with you,
like natural people.

361
01:01:00,369 --> 01:01:02,929
I wanna have your children
and raise them someplace...

362
01:01:03,089 --> 01:01:05,887
...where there ain't even
a shadow of slavery.

363
01:01:06,049 --> 01:01:11,282
I think about sewing,
making pretty things for my family...

364
01:01:11,449 --> 01:01:13,644
...while my hands are still steady.

365
01:01:20,329 --> 01:01:22,399
I wanna go someplace with you.

366
01:01:22,569 --> 01:01:24,639
I wanna have your children.

367
01:01:24,809 --> 01:01:26,800
But I won't have them here.

368
01:01:27,809 --> 01:01:30,369
I am going somewhere.

369
01:01:32,609 --> 01:01:35,077
They won't have us in Canada...

370
01:01:35,249 --> 01:01:39,845
...l'll go to the edge of the ocean,
and I'll walks on away from here.

371
01:01:43,969 --> 01:01:46,881
St. Ann Parish folk...

372
01:01:49,409 --> 01:01:53,243
They're heading out there,
and they ain't got no food, no seed.

373
01:01:54,249 --> 01:01:57,127
And they starve when the winter come.

374
01:01:57,289 --> 01:01:59,678
Buck, honey, you just one man.

375
01:02:00,569 --> 01:02:02,560
But I gave my word.

376
01:02:11,969 --> 01:02:14,119
Eat your food.

377
01:02:19,569 --> 01:02:21,844
I'll go see about the horses.

378
01:03:06,849 --> 01:03:08,441
What you studying, honey?

379
01:03:10,729 --> 01:03:13,607
Troubled about all that killing.

380
01:03:16,729 --> 01:03:18,799
I killed men before.

381
01:03:20,089 --> 01:03:23,559
I just don't know which way
to turn no more. I think they beat me.

382
01:03:26,089 --> 01:03:31,641
Drivers couldn't do it in slavery days, nor
the rebels in the war, but now I think...

383
01:03:32,009 --> 01:03:33,920
...they beat me.

384
01:03:36,449 --> 01:03:37,882
You're just tired.

385
01:03:39,209 --> 01:03:43,805
When it's dark, looks like the heart
just gets to hurting sometimes.

386
01:03:44,849 --> 01:03:47,488
You gonna keep on fighting
best way you can.

387
01:03:47,649 --> 01:03:51,005
Looks like there
just ain't no other way.

388
01:03:52,249 --> 01:03:54,809
I love you, Buck.

389
01:04:24,249 --> 01:04:26,683
Where'd you get them cannons?

390
01:04:28,809 --> 01:04:31,164
Gunsmith in Fort Leavenworth.

391
01:04:32,329 --> 01:04:34,240
Where'd you get that funny Bible?

392
01:04:35,769 --> 01:04:38,442
Well, that my inheritance.

393
01:04:38,609 --> 01:04:40,520
Before the war, when I was a boy...

394
01:04:40,689 --> 01:04:43,249
...my mama and me was sold
to a travelling preacher.

395
01:04:43,449 --> 01:04:46,088
I'd fetch for him
and take up collection.

396
01:04:46,249 --> 01:04:48,683
And when he got drunk,
I'd haul him off to bed.

397
01:04:49,049 --> 01:04:52,166
He travelled in little towns,
preaching sin and hellfire.

398
01:04:52,329 --> 01:04:54,763
When he got them gals
full of the Holy Spirit...

399
01:04:54,929 --> 01:04:57,602
...when they're ready to repent,
he'd jerk them.

400
01:04:57,929 --> 01:04:59,647
Between wiles...

401
01:04:59,809 --> 01:05:02,164
...he'd take my mama to bed.

402
01:05:02,329 --> 01:05:04,445
And I'd sleep out with the horse.

403
01:05:05,329 --> 01:05:09,925
By and by, about 16, he sent me
to town for a jug of whiskey.

404
01:05:10,089 --> 01:05:12,080
When I come back,
my mama was gone.

405
01:05:12,289 --> 01:05:14,644
He sold her
for a couple hundred dollars.

406
01:05:16,609 --> 01:05:19,169
He got drunk that night,
and he said:

407
01:05:19,329 --> 01:05:21,889
"Boy, put me to bed."

408
01:05:23,849 --> 01:05:27,728
So I lead that man into
the tanning yard by the lime pit.

409
01:05:27,889 --> 01:05:30,244
And I put him to bed right there.

410
01:05:30,409 --> 01:05:32,923
I hold him under
with a cedar fence rail.

411
01:05:38,449 --> 01:05:40,360
There was no next of kin.

412
01:05:40,529 --> 01:05:43,327
So I got the cart, the horse...

413
01:05:44,809 --> 01:05:47,767
Preacher clothes
and this funny Bible.

414
01:05:51,329 --> 01:05:54,082
Where are you gonna find that money?

415
01:05:56,169 --> 01:05:58,125
I don't know.

416
01:06:00,249 --> 01:06:03,958
If it was me, I'd look for money
where money's kept.

417
01:06:04,129 --> 01:06:06,962
Like in a bank
or an Express office.

418
01:06:09,089 --> 01:06:11,603
We gonna walk in the bank
and just take it?

419
01:06:11,809 --> 01:06:13,879
That's right, brother.

420
01:06:15,289 --> 01:06:17,200
And I know just the place.

421
01:06:18,209 --> 01:06:21,645
Where they ain't got no sheriff,
no deputy and hardly any men...

422
01:06:22,089 --> 01:06:26,560
...because they out in the countryside
chasing two poor field hands.

423
01:06:26,729 --> 01:06:29,243
You're crazy.

424
01:06:30,689 --> 01:06:32,520
Yeah.

425
01:08:10,289 --> 01:08:12,405
What you want, boy?

426
01:08:15,969 --> 01:08:18,199
You make a sound,
and you're a dead man.

427
01:09:06,129 --> 01:09:08,279
We ain't got all day.

428
01:09:17,529 --> 01:09:19,645
What's in the box?

429
01:09:19,809 --> 01:09:22,687
- What's in the box?
- U.S. Government shipment.

430
01:09:24,729 --> 01:09:26,560
Shipment of what?

431
01:09:27,649 --> 01:09:29,162
What?

432
01:09:29,689 --> 01:09:30,883
Gold.

433
01:09:33,569 --> 01:09:35,241
Gold.

434
01:09:35,889 --> 01:09:37,800
Sweet God Almighty, that's gold.

435
01:09:39,609 --> 01:09:42,885
- Where's the paper money?
- There isn't any.

436
01:09:43,049 --> 01:09:45,722
I sent the cash deposit
over to the bank.

437
01:09:46,249 --> 01:09:48,444
Will you get off that?!

438
01:09:48,609 --> 01:09:53,046
- That's a whole mess of gold.
- You can't carry it on a horse.

439
01:09:53,209 --> 01:09:55,598
Where's the key?
There's got to be a key!

440
01:09:55,809 --> 01:09:58,482
It's in Texas.
They always send the key separate.

441
01:09:58,649 --> 01:10:01,686
He's telling the truth,
but there's got to be paper money.

442
01:10:01,849 --> 01:10:05,285
I'm gonna ask you for the last time.
Where is that paper money?

443
01:10:06,209 --> 01:10:07,961
I told you.

444
01:10:08,129 --> 01:10:11,963
At the bank.
I sent it over there.

445
01:10:14,689 --> 01:10:17,487
- What do you think?
- What the hell?

446
01:10:17,649 --> 01:10:21,005
Otherwise, we done wasted
the whole morning.

447
01:10:58,089 --> 01:11:00,808
Posse's riding by.
Sheriff's with them.

448
01:11:10,249 --> 01:11:11,841
Well, that's it.

449
01:11:12,009 --> 01:11:15,081
- Let's get out of here.
- Preacher.

450
01:11:17,489 --> 01:11:21,607
- I'm going to that bank.
- It's across from the sheriff's office!

451
01:11:22,969 --> 01:11:25,961
There's an awful lot
of money down there.

452
01:11:26,449 --> 01:11:28,679
Otherwise, we done wasted
the whole morning.

453
01:11:29,129 --> 01:11:31,438
You're the one that's crazy.

454
01:13:45,849 --> 01:13:50,081
- Morning, Miss Esther. How you feeling?
- Some better, thanks.

455
01:13:50,249 --> 01:13:53,764
Thing like that's not easy to forget,
but life goes on.

456
01:13:53,929 --> 01:13:56,318
- My money good enough for you?
- Money's money.

457
01:13:56,489 --> 01:13:58,400
Hard-earned too.

458
01:13:58,569 --> 01:14:01,242
Wages of sin,
just so's I get 3 percent on them.

459
01:14:03,089 --> 01:14:05,557
I got stuck with Ohio bank notes.
Are they any good?

460
01:14:05,729 --> 01:14:08,607
That depends on the solvency
of that particular...

461
01:15:51,089 --> 01:15:53,398
Hold up! Hold up!

462
01:18:04,129 --> 01:18:05,847
They're gonna get away!

463
01:18:06,009 --> 01:18:07,408
Yeah.

464
01:18:09,409 --> 01:18:12,082
You shoot that rifle, boy,
and we're dead!

465
01:18:12,249 --> 01:18:14,843
You gonna quit?

466
01:18:15,729 --> 01:18:18,197
- Remember that wagon train you shot up?
- Yeah.

467
01:18:18,369 --> 01:18:20,041
They never did come back.

468
01:18:20,209 --> 01:18:22,484
I wonder if they're joining up
with them.

469
01:19:08,009 --> 01:19:11,604
- He say he will not fight them for you.
- I understand.

470
01:19:11,769 --> 01:19:15,557
Tell him I just need help
to get through to my people.

471
01:19:19,329 --> 01:19:22,082
They need supplies,
and I can pay.

472
01:19:22,249 --> 01:19:25,605
Dried meat, as much as he can sell them.
Horses, powder and shot.

473
01:19:32,209 --> 01:19:33,608
Five horses.

474
01:19:34,649 --> 01:19:36,719
No powder.

475
01:19:36,889 --> 01:19:38,720
No guns.

476
01:19:42,049 --> 01:19:43,448
Ask him again.

477
01:19:43,609 --> 01:19:45,964
Tell him we're all brothers.

478
01:19:46,169 --> 01:19:48,888
He will not give you guns.
They come too hard.

479
01:19:49,089 --> 01:19:51,364
- Food.
- Dried meat.

480
01:19:52,449 --> 01:19:54,883
Flour. Corn.

481
01:19:55,089 --> 01:19:56,158
Do not ask for more.

482
01:19:56,329 --> 01:19:59,958
He stopped that posse because
he gave his word to let you through safe.

483
01:20:00,129 --> 01:20:03,519
- He will do no more.
- Ask him again.

484
01:20:04,209 --> 01:20:07,997
Tell him they looking for their own land,
and they'll have to fight for it...

485
01:20:08,169 --> 01:20:11,002
...because they can't live
back there, no way.

486
01:20:34,329 --> 01:20:38,288
Before the yellow hair, my father,
my grandfather hunted buffalo...

487
01:20:38,489 --> 01:20:40,923
...raised pony and took women
on the land...

488
01:20:41,089 --> 01:20:44,559
...where Fox River crosses
the grassland at Place of Skull.

489
01:20:44,769 --> 01:20:47,920
Now Copper Spring, Fort Sheridan.

490
01:20:56,129 --> 01:20:59,804
Now we are here with our backs
against Snow Mountain.

491
01:21:06,049 --> 01:21:10,327
And yellow hair send wagon,
soldier and speaking wire.

492
01:21:16,729 --> 01:21:18,560
Tomorrow we will be like ghosts.

493
01:21:18,729 --> 01:21:22,119
Like the spirits that come in dreams
with no earth to walk on.

494
01:21:25,329 --> 01:21:27,206
But we will fight.

495
01:21:36,489 --> 01:21:40,846
We will fight ten tens of years,
and our children's children will fight.

496
01:21:41,049 --> 01:21:45,645
We need our guns, bullets and powder
for our own fight.

497
01:21:46,089 --> 01:21:48,967
Tell him his enemies
are our enemies.

498
01:22:00,609 --> 01:22:06,241
He say you black people fought
with that enemy against our people.

499
01:22:07,489 --> 01:22:09,400
I ain't in the Army no more.

500
01:22:09,609 --> 01:22:11,679
He knows, Buck.

501
01:22:12,289 --> 01:22:14,007
No guns.

502
01:22:14,169 --> 01:22:15,841
No bullets.

503
01:22:41,569 --> 01:22:44,129
Eighteen hundred dollars.
That's your share.

504
01:22:52,609 --> 01:22:57,125
For what we have just received,
we give thanks. In Jesus' name, amen.

505
01:23:00,569 --> 01:23:04,482
I'm going back East to Illinois,
and I'm gonna buy me a tent.

506
01:23:04,649 --> 01:23:08,164
I'm gonna have the biggest revival
meeting since King Solomon...

507
01:23:08,329 --> 01:23:11,207
...preached to his wives
and concubines. Amen.

508
01:23:11,369 --> 01:23:14,918
And you, brother,
you got a good woman there.

509
01:23:15,089 --> 01:23:20,402
Take that money and buy yourself a living
and do like she want. Go to Canada.

510
01:23:22,769 --> 01:23:24,646
All right, brother.

511
01:23:24,809 --> 01:23:26,322
One question.

512
01:23:26,489 --> 01:23:28,286
How do I get out of here?

513
01:23:28,449 --> 01:23:29,882
To Illinois?

514
01:23:30,089 --> 01:23:34,844
One of two ways. Go on back the way
we come and on across Kansas.

515
01:23:35,009 --> 01:23:38,126
- There's a posse with a trigger hitch.
- Yes, there is.

516
01:23:38,289 --> 01:23:40,166
What's the other way?

517
01:23:40,369 --> 01:23:42,803
Keep on west, across the Pecos
to where I'm going.

518
01:23:42,969 --> 01:23:45,847
Into the mountains
and north along the Idaho Territory...

519
01:23:46,049 --> 01:23:47,926
...then back by the Canadian border.

520
01:23:48,089 --> 01:23:50,045
- How long that take?
- All winter.

521
01:23:50,209 --> 01:23:54,202
All winter. What's my chances
of sneaking past the posse?

522
01:23:54,769 --> 01:23:56,487
Not much.

523
01:23:57,609 --> 01:23:59,645
When I caught you
eating my rabbit...

524
01:23:59,809 --> 01:24:04,883
...I should've got me a rock, busted you
upside your head and left you for dead.

525
01:24:56,209 --> 01:24:58,928
Scout come in.
That posse did not go back.

526
01:24:59,129 --> 01:25:02,280
- They're tracking the wagon train.
- How close are they to it?

527
01:25:02,609 --> 01:25:04,839
One-day ride from the big river.

528
01:25:05,049 --> 01:25:08,200
How long will it take us to catch them,
riding straight through?

529
01:25:17,409 --> 01:25:23,086
Maybe two days. He will give you guides
to take you through the high pass.

530
01:25:26,809 --> 01:25:28,959
Remember, they will not fight for you.

531
01:25:30,409 --> 01:25:32,127
I know.

532
01:25:49,809 --> 01:25:51,879
Looks like the back door's open.

533
01:25:52,049 --> 01:25:55,405
Figure I can skate on through
and take my chances.

534
01:25:57,009 --> 01:26:01,924
You done walked more than half
the journey with the St. Ann Parish folk.

535
01:26:02,089 --> 01:26:05,923
That's all a normal man can do.
What do you wanna die for them for?

536
01:27:04,449 --> 01:27:07,805
What happened?
Somebody close the back door?

537
01:27:19,849 --> 01:27:22,807
If they're gonna join up with them,
they'll do it before sundown.

538
01:27:22,969 --> 01:27:24,880
Let's finish off that wagon train.

539
01:27:25,049 --> 01:27:27,802
They ain't broke any laws I know about.

540
01:27:28,169 --> 01:27:32,242
- We gotta turn them around.
- What you got against them folks?

541
01:27:32,409 --> 01:27:35,321
You on their side?
You soft in the head for them?

542
01:27:35,489 --> 01:27:38,606
- They killed Uncle Beau, robbed the bank.
- They didn't!

543
01:27:38,769 --> 01:27:42,808
Buck and that preacher did.
And that's all we're after.

544
01:27:43,969 --> 01:27:47,723
You don't understand.
I gotta turn them field hands around.

545
01:27:48,929 --> 01:27:52,638
If we leave them fields go fallow now,
we done lost it all.

546
01:27:52,809 --> 01:27:56,597
We gotta keep it going like it was,
the way they rightfully belong.

547
01:27:56,769 --> 01:28:00,000
You got 16 white men
down there. Sixteen.

548
01:28:00,169 --> 01:28:04,799
You just give me half of them,
and I'll finish that job.

549
01:28:05,089 --> 01:28:10,209
As far as I'm concerned, that wagon train
can go anywhere it likes!

550
01:28:13,089 --> 01:28:15,603
And you make one move
against those people...

551
01:28:15,769 --> 01:28:20,524
...l'll take you to Copper Springs with
you tied under the belly of your horse.

552
01:28:40,409 --> 01:28:43,924
- Where's Ollie?
- He went to cover the pass.

553
01:28:44,369 --> 01:28:46,644
He'll say, "boo," if that
Buck comes through.

554
01:28:47,169 --> 01:28:50,241
- What does he want us to do?
- Take the wagon train.

555
01:28:53,209 --> 01:28:55,677
Well, if that's what he said...

556
01:28:55,889 --> 01:28:57,845
Let's go!

557
01:29:26,289 --> 01:29:29,008
- You gonna have to take it to them.
- What you gonna do?

558
01:29:29,209 --> 01:29:30,801
- We can draw them south.
- But...

559
01:29:30,969 --> 01:29:34,484
You go with the wagon train.
I'll come to you later.

560
01:31:02,089 --> 01:31:05,638
Get up on top. Go around
in front of them and cut them off!

561
01:34:14,249 --> 01:34:16,126
I run out.

562
01:38:44,249 --> 01:38:45,238
