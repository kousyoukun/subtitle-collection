1
00:04:16,217 --> 00:04:21,139
Your land runs 1000 rods to the left of
that big tree, then it follows the creek.

2
00:04:21,305 --> 00:04:25,434
- You keep this paper good, now.
- You want to stay with us a spell?

3
00:04:26,019 --> 00:04:28,355
Sure be obliged.

4
00:04:29,022 --> 00:04:30,482
Thank you.

5
00:04:41,659 --> 00:04:43,077
Good luck.

6
00:07:59,774 --> 00:08:02,235
Now you listen to me, you hear?

7
00:08:02,402 --> 00:08:05,155
You people from Louisiana, ain't you?

8
00:08:05,571 --> 00:08:09,909
Well, there's plenty of work for you
back there: Chopping cotton, cutting cane.

9
00:08:10,493 --> 00:08:12,745
Good jobs with people who know you.

10
00:08:12,912 --> 00:08:15,706
You was born there.
You was raised there.

11
00:08:15,873 --> 00:08:19,460
You don't belong out here.
You couldn't last the winter.

12
00:08:19,627 --> 00:08:21,754
You ain't got no place to live.

13
00:08:21,921 --> 00:08:24,632
No farm tools, no sheep.

14
00:08:24,799 --> 00:08:28,678
So you're gonna turn
around and go home.

15
00:08:30,471 --> 00:08:32,598
Hey, you.

16
00:08:33,349 --> 00:08:34,892
Come here.

17
00:08:42,483 --> 00:08:43,776
Where's Buck?

18
00:08:45,653 --> 00:08:49,115
I'm looking for your
wagonmaster, name of Buck.

19
00:08:51,617 --> 00:08:53,702
No Buck here.

20
00:08:55,413 --> 00:08:57,248
Don't know nobody named Buck.

21
00:08:57,457 --> 00:09:00,293
He's the one that brought
you here, isn't he?

22
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:04,422
So where'd he go? Where'd you
hire him, and where's he staying?

23
00:09:05,048 --> 00:09:07,300
He had a name something else.

24
00:09:07,467 --> 00:09:10,136
Ain't no Buck!

25
00:09:10,762 --> 00:09:12,430
Where's Buck?

26
00:11:07,503 --> 00:11:09,797
He's leery, Floyd.

27
00:11:10,715 --> 00:11:14,093
You hear me. You're gonna go
outside and wave to your old man.

28
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:18,598
If you holler anything, I'll kill
everything around here that moves.

29
00:11:18,765 --> 00:11:20,267
Everything.

30
00:14:27,954 --> 00:14:30,290
Get them horses! Floyd!

31
00:14:31,833 --> 00:14:33,418
Get on!

32
00:17:32,930 --> 00:17:35,057
Well, how do?

33
00:17:39,312 --> 00:17:41,064
I need a horse.

34
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:44,024
- I can see that.
- I'll pay you $20.

35
00:17:44,192 --> 00:17:46,444
That's a handsome price.

36
00:17:48,363 --> 00:17:50,907
But I ain't in the
horse-trading business, brother.

37
00:17:51,074 --> 00:17:53,201
I got to travel fast.

38
00:17:53,368 --> 00:17:57,038
I sure do wish I could be
of service to you, but...

39
00:17:57,205 --> 00:18:01,084
- I don't want to have to take him.
- Who says you have to?

40
00:18:02,126 --> 00:18:03,919
Hold it.

41
00:18:04,587 --> 00:18:09,550
You got any objection if I get into
my drawers? Or do you need them too?

42
00:18:33,574 --> 00:18:36,619
Just getting my boots,
brother. Just getting my boots.

43
00:18:53,511 --> 00:18:56,264
- You're eating my rabbit.
- What you doing out here?

44
00:18:58,099 --> 00:19:00,560
Getting into my drawers.

45
00:19:32,884 --> 00:19:35,053
- You gonna take my horse?
- Drop your drawers.

46
00:19:35,219 --> 00:19:36,929
- Wait a damn minute!
- Drop them!

47
00:19:39,557 --> 00:19:41,559
Damn!

48
00:19:55,823 --> 00:19:58,617
You forgot your coffee!

49
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:41,202
There's two mountains
pointing up to the sky.

50
00:20:41,369 --> 00:20:44,038
Beyond that, there's a valley.

51
00:20:44,205 --> 00:20:47,291
Green with cool water.

52
00:20:47,458 --> 00:20:49,669
I can see it. It's there.

53
00:20:49,836 --> 00:20:52,255
Call it Colorado.

54
00:20:52,755 --> 00:20:54,799
But don't turn back.

55
00:20:54,966 --> 00:20:57,927
That valley is going to be our home.

56
00:21:07,395 --> 00:21:09,480
We're going on.

57
00:21:18,948 --> 00:21:20,283
All right.

58
00:21:20,450 --> 00:21:24,996
Nightriders hit Pappy Whitlock
and his people here two weeks ago.

59
00:21:25,163 --> 00:21:28,541
Then they burned a wagon train
meeting me at Sulphur Flats.

60
00:21:28,708 --> 00:21:30,543
Right here.

61
00:21:31,127 --> 00:21:33,671
Then they got the Deaf
Smith County people...

62
00:21:33,838 --> 00:21:36,299
...at the water hole
this side of Clay Town.

63
00:21:36,966 --> 00:21:38,676
They're heading this way.

64
00:21:38,843 --> 00:21:41,679
You've got to move out tonight.

65
00:23:04,387 --> 00:23:05,638
Morning, sir.

66
00:23:05,805 --> 00:23:08,558
Could you get me a bottle
of whiskey out here?

67
00:23:08,725 --> 00:23:10,143
You could go inside.

68
00:23:10,309 --> 00:23:15,231
My man, good liquor is best
enjoyed under the open firmament.

69
00:23:15,898 --> 00:23:19,360
Anyways, my heart yearneth
for the dusky company...

70
00:23:19,527 --> 00:23:21,487
...of my own emancipated people.

71
00:23:23,197 --> 00:23:25,491
Where are the coloured
folks? Where do you live?

72
00:23:25,658 --> 00:23:29,287
With my mammy and the rest at
Mr. Logan's place, 10 miles out.

73
00:23:29,454 --> 00:23:33,041
- Do all the coloured live there?
- No, sir. We just passing through.

74
00:23:33,207 --> 00:23:36,252
We made a crop for Mr. Logan.

75
00:23:36,419 --> 00:23:38,004
Boy!

76
00:23:39,339 --> 00:23:40,465
The whiskey, son.

77
00:23:40,631 --> 00:23:42,925
Forty cents a bottle, cash money.

78
00:23:50,350 --> 00:23:52,185
Oh, here.

79
00:26:06,611 --> 00:26:09,030
Where'd you get that horse?

80
00:26:09,489 --> 00:26:11,950
It was delivered to
me in the wilderness.

81
00:26:12,116 --> 00:26:14,285
Where's the man who rode that horse?

82
00:26:14,452 --> 00:26:17,622
- I don't know.
- What do you mean, you don't know?

83
00:26:18,498 --> 00:26:20,834
A man cometh and a man goeth.

84
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,628
In this wilderness, who
shall know but the Lord?

85
00:26:24,087 --> 00:26:25,463
Don't play with me.

86
00:26:27,507 --> 00:26:29,968
There's nobody back there, Uncle Beau.

87
00:26:30,134 --> 00:26:31,510
Where's Buck?

88
00:26:31,678 --> 00:26:34,181
- Is that his name? Buck?
- Where is he?

89
00:26:38,643 --> 00:26:42,105
Mister, I'm looking
for that miserable...

90
00:26:42,271 --> 00:26:45,566
...no-good, low-down
sinner myself.

91
00:26:45,733 --> 00:26:48,569
And when I find him, I'll
smite him hip and thigh.

92
00:26:48,736 --> 00:26:52,698
- How come you got his horse?
- On account of he stole mine.

93
00:26:52,865 --> 00:26:55,701
- And left me out there to perish.
- He's lying.

94
00:26:56,661 --> 00:26:59,831
As God is my judge!
I swear on this Bible!

95
00:27:01,124 --> 00:27:02,584
What you doing out here?

96
00:27:03,710 --> 00:27:07,214
Wandering as the Lord wills,
spreading the word of the gospel.

97
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:10,008
I'm doing like you
gentlemen, I'm fighting sin.

98
00:27:10,174 --> 00:27:15,179
You hear me. We want this
Buck. We want him bad.

99
00:27:15,346 --> 00:27:19,642
You see him, you
tell us where he is...

100
00:27:20,685 --> 00:27:24,230
...there's $500 for you.

101
00:27:24,397 --> 00:27:26,065
Can you remember that?

102
00:27:26,232 --> 00:27:29,235
Five hundred dollars?

103
00:27:29,402 --> 00:27:31,779
That's easy to remember.

104
00:27:32,697 --> 00:27:36,868
I don't suppose for that kind of money
you particular whether he dead or alive?

105
00:27:37,035 --> 00:27:38,078
Either.

106
00:27:38,244 --> 00:27:41,831
And if in my search for
this sinner, I finds him...

107
00:27:41,998 --> 00:27:44,501
...tell me, where do
I finds you gentlemens?

108
00:27:44,667 --> 00:27:48,296
Copper Springs. Ask for Deshay.

109
00:27:48,463 --> 00:27:51,549
Deshay. Mr. Deshay.

110
00:27:52,925 --> 00:27:57,888
So you a wandering preacher
ministering to your people out here?

111
00:27:58,056 --> 00:27:59,724
Yes, sir.

112
00:27:59,891 --> 00:28:03,520
Though they's few and far between,
the need for salvation is everywhere.

113
00:28:03,686 --> 00:28:05,771
Best thing you can tell them:

114
00:28:06,397 --> 00:28:09,901
Turn around and go back home.

115
00:28:10,568 --> 00:28:13,196
"Turn around and go back home."

116
00:28:43,309 --> 00:28:45,394
Young man!

117
00:28:53,861 --> 00:28:56,447
- Pleasant afternoon.
- Yes, sir.

118
00:28:56,614 --> 00:28:58,449
You walk home every day?

119
00:28:58,616 --> 00:29:01,077
No, sir. I sleeps under the bar.

120
00:29:01,244 --> 00:29:05,457
They finished with the crop for Mr. Logan,
and they going to have pig and chicken.

121
00:29:05,623 --> 00:29:07,708
That a fact? Who's your preacher?

122
00:29:07,875 --> 00:29:11,587
- We ain't got none.
- Then who gives thanks to the Lord?

123
00:29:11,754 --> 00:29:15,049
This old Uncle Cudjo. He's
more conjurer than preacher.

124
00:29:15,216 --> 00:29:17,093
That a fact?

125
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:21,014
May I prevail upon you to
share my beast of burden?

126
00:29:21,681 --> 00:29:23,725
The horse, son.

127
00:29:45,872 --> 00:29:47,832
Who's that with Toby?

128
00:30:08,811 --> 00:30:10,396
Blessings in his name.

129
00:30:10,563 --> 00:30:15,610
I'm the Reverend Willis Oakes Rutherford
of the Holiness Persuasion Church.

130
00:30:15,777 --> 00:30:19,447
- Where you from, reverend?
- Sunflower County, Mississippi mostly.

131
00:30:19,614 --> 00:30:21,783
And whereabouts you heading?

132
00:30:21,949 --> 00:30:26,620
In the vastness of God's earth,
every corner challenges my ministry.

133
00:30:26,788 --> 00:30:29,332
I'm headed there, and I
could be there tomorrow.

134
00:30:30,625 --> 00:30:35,755
- Where you from, brother?
- We all from St. Ann Parish, Louisiana.

135
00:30:36,673 --> 00:30:38,216
My name is Kingston.

136
00:30:38,383 --> 00:30:40,635
Pleased to meet you, Brother Kingston.

137
00:30:40,802 --> 00:30:43,263
Well, well. Sister.

138
00:30:43,429 --> 00:30:44,805
Reverend.

139
00:30:44,972 --> 00:30:48,767
- You've come a long way. A long way.
- And we going further yet.

140
00:30:49,686 --> 00:30:53,607
I do admire to meet a good
Christian congregation.

141
00:30:57,276 --> 00:30:58,319
Yes.

142
00:30:58,486 --> 00:31:01,447
And if you'll permit me...

143
00:31:01,739 --> 00:31:03,658
After a bit of supper...

144
00:31:04,450 --> 00:31:08,371
...I would like to offer a prayer
for your safe guidance here...

145
00:31:08,538 --> 00:31:11,791
...beneath the wonders
of God's creation.

146
00:31:54,834 --> 00:31:56,294
How'd you find me?

147
00:31:56,461 --> 00:31:58,380
I asked your horse.

148
00:32:01,007 --> 00:32:03,218
It's all right. It ain't nothing.

149
00:32:05,219 --> 00:32:10,349
- What's on your mind?
- My horse, amongst other things.

150
00:32:10,516 --> 00:32:13,644
You'll get your horse. What
are you doing round here?

151
00:32:13,811 --> 00:32:16,230
Just spreading the
sweet word of the gospel.

152
00:32:17,648 --> 00:32:19,358
You a preacher?

153
00:32:19,525 --> 00:32:21,485
The Reverend Willis
Oakes Rutherford...

154
00:32:21,652 --> 00:32:26,907
...of the high and low order of
the Holiness Persuasion Church.

155
00:32:28,076 --> 00:32:31,663
You can take supper here, reverend.
That'll square for the rabbit.

156
00:32:31,829 --> 00:32:34,623
You can rest a while,
and then you move on.

157
00:32:34,791 --> 00:32:36,209
Buck.

158
00:32:43,341 --> 00:32:47,470
Fifty, 60, 70, 80, 90.

159
00:32:47,637 --> 00:32:50,473
Four hundred, 410, 420.

160
00:32:50,682 --> 00:32:52,934
Four mules, a litter of pigs.

161
00:32:53,142 --> 00:32:55,645
Right on the barrelhead,
fair and square.

162
00:32:55,812 --> 00:32:56,980
That's right.

163
00:33:00,441 --> 00:33:04,654
If you folks want to stay and plant
another crop, we'll make the same deal.

164
00:33:05,488 --> 00:33:09,993
No. Expect we better be moving on.
But much obliged to you anyway, sir.

165
00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:11,535
All right.

166
00:35:09,570 --> 00:35:11,530
Which way you riding, Preacher?

167
00:35:11,698 --> 00:35:14,284
I've not exactly settled my mind yet.

168
00:35:14,450 --> 00:35:18,287
You've got three possibilities:
North, south or east.

169
00:35:18,454 --> 00:35:20,289
- What happened to west?
- We going west.

170
00:35:20,456 --> 00:35:24,251
There's a lot of room out there.
It's not elbow to elbow out that way.

171
00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:27,421
You've got your horse.
Don't press your luck.

172
00:35:27,630 --> 00:35:29,882
Tell me something.
What you got against me?

173
00:35:30,049 --> 00:35:33,970
Nothing. But it's a fool farmer let
the weasel travel in the chicken coop.

174
00:35:34,137 --> 00:35:39,142
I know an Eastman when I see one.
These people ain't for picking.

175
00:35:39,308 --> 00:35:42,436
I told you, I ain't no
Eastman. I'm a preacher.

176
00:35:58,953 --> 00:36:04,333
On the other hand, you could say it's
a might stuffy out there to the west.

177
00:36:06,127 --> 00:36:07,962
Amen, brother.

178
00:36:09,839 --> 00:36:12,342
Fivefold, amen.

179
00:36:49,045 --> 00:36:51,464
- Double your watch tonight, hear?
- I'll do that.

180
00:36:51,631 --> 00:36:53,508
I'll be back tomorrow by sundown.

181
00:36:53,675 --> 00:36:57,888
- You can find water holes on the map?
- Yeah, they're plain.

182
00:38:18,593 --> 00:38:20,470
Indians!

183
00:38:20,636 --> 00:38:22,805
Buck, Indians!

184
00:38:28,353 --> 00:38:30,730
- What are you doing?
- Get off your horse.

185
00:38:30,938 --> 00:38:33,732
- Have you looked behind you recent?
- Get down!

186
00:38:43,993 --> 00:38:45,828
Don't tell me you took to praying.

187
00:38:46,037 --> 00:38:51,793
Preacher, you do as I say. Hunker
down and keep your mouth shut.

188
00:39:22,990 --> 00:39:24,533
Sweet Jesus.

189
00:39:30,540 --> 00:39:32,834
Lord of mercy, look at that.

190
00:39:33,001 --> 00:39:35,795
If you don't be quiet,
you're gonna be dead.

191
00:39:39,549 --> 00:39:41,217
- Do you have good health?
- Yes.

192
00:39:41,384 --> 00:39:43,720
- Things go well?
- Some things, some days.

193
00:39:45,179 --> 00:39:47,014
What do you want, sergeant?

194
00:39:47,223 --> 00:39:49,350
I got a wagon train coming through.

195
00:39:51,978 --> 00:39:54,731
Forty head of people,
not including children.

196
00:39:54,897 --> 00:39:56,941
- What kind of people?
- Black.

197
00:39:57,150 --> 00:40:00,070
I want them to get through
safe to the pass north...

198
00:40:00,236 --> 00:40:02,113
...on the west bank of the Pecos.

199
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:26,012
You have five days to pass.

200
00:40:26,179 --> 00:40:28,723
They got sorry horses
and worn-out mules.

201
00:40:29,182 --> 00:40:30,558
Five days.

202
00:40:32,518 --> 00:40:33,728
All right.

203
00:40:33,936 --> 00:40:36,105
Ten dollars each one.

204
00:40:36,272 --> 00:40:38,775
I was thinking on $6.

205
00:40:40,234 --> 00:40:41,569
Eight.

206
00:40:43,196 --> 00:40:47,951
They've gotta live through the winter,
and they got children. They ain't worth 8.

207
00:40:55,083 --> 00:40:57,085
Eight. Children nothing.

208
00:40:57,251 --> 00:41:00,421
They gonna need food. I can
get by if I kill three buffalo.

209
00:41:11,015 --> 00:41:12,850
One buffalo.

210
00:41:38,501 --> 00:41:42,797
My husband say two
buffalo, if you must.

211
00:41:42,964 --> 00:41:45,008
Thank you.

212
00:42:19,375 --> 00:42:23,504
Brother, you a man of many parts. How
do you know how to deal with Indians?

213
00:42:23,713 --> 00:42:27,592
- What were you tracking me for?
- Me?

214
00:42:27,759 --> 00:42:29,427
Fact is, I got lost.

215
00:42:29,635 --> 00:42:34,473
I praise God I found your tracks, or I
might've perished out here like a heathen.

216
00:44:01,978 --> 00:44:03,730
Toby?

217
00:46:23,661 --> 00:46:24,954
God!

218
00:46:45,141 --> 00:46:48,853
Come on, now. Yeah, that's good.

219
00:46:49,020 --> 00:46:50,813
Okay. It's all right now.

220
00:46:57,612 --> 00:46:59,781
Get me some water.

221
00:47:11,501 --> 00:47:14,504
And the money's gone. All $1400.

222
00:47:14,671 --> 00:47:18,758
How we gonna live through the
winter? Where we gonna get food, seed?

223
00:47:18,925 --> 00:47:21,261
We done been turned around.

224
00:47:23,012 --> 00:47:26,432
Penny. Suzanna. Tom DeCooper.

225
00:47:27,100 --> 00:47:28,685
Joseph.

226
00:47:29,977 --> 00:47:33,147
Rachel and Toby. All dead.

227
00:47:34,482 --> 00:47:38,486
But the valley is there.

228
00:47:38,653 --> 00:47:40,864
Green and wild.

229
00:47:43,533 --> 00:47:44,868
It's there.

230
00:47:55,545 --> 00:47:58,339
We gonna go on.

231
00:47:59,924 --> 00:48:02,969
You ain't got no supplies, no food.

232
00:48:03,136 --> 00:48:06,097
You can't make it through the winter.

233
00:48:06,264 --> 00:48:09,058
Then we dies in the snow.

234
00:48:14,188 --> 00:48:18,025
No, you ain't gonna die in the snow.

235
00:48:21,863 --> 00:48:25,492
The old man said we're going
on? Then by God, we're going.

236
00:48:25,658 --> 00:48:28,870
But we ain't got the money
to pay what we owe you.

237
00:48:29,037 --> 00:48:32,415
Don't matter. You paid for safe
passage through the Indian land.

238
00:48:32,582 --> 00:48:37,087
You'll cross north of the salt
wells. You only got five days to pass.

239
00:48:37,253 --> 00:48:40,882
I'll find you somewhere
north of the Pecos.

240
00:48:46,554 --> 00:48:49,098
Ain't nothing left
here for you, Eastman.

241
00:48:49,265 --> 00:48:52,560
You can come or go. It don't matter.

242
00:49:04,113 --> 00:49:07,658
You ever hear of Copper Springs?
Ten riders, boss named Deshay.

243
00:49:07,825 --> 00:49:09,160
How you know?

244
00:49:09,327 --> 00:49:12,247
They catched me with your
horse at Frenchman's Ford.

245
00:49:12,413 --> 00:49:15,374
They asked a lot of mean
questions. Now I know why.

246
00:49:16,042 --> 00:49:19,337
- Copper Springs?
- I heard them say they holes up there.

247
00:49:19,504 --> 00:49:22,090
And I remember every
one of them faces.

248
00:50:04,590 --> 00:50:07,927
- Deshay, hold up a minute.
- Ollie, how are things?

249
00:50:08,136 --> 00:50:09,804
I wanna talk to you.

250
00:50:09,971 --> 00:50:13,808
Delighted. Floyd, get me a bourbon.

251
00:50:15,226 --> 00:50:18,271
You ran into a couple of
wagon trains out yonder.

252
00:50:18,438 --> 00:50:21,066
We just had a little talk, is all.

253
00:50:21,232 --> 00:50:22,859
You listen to me, Deshay.

254
00:50:23,067 --> 00:50:28,030
Nobody's gonna be gunned downed or
burned out here as long as I have a say.

255
00:50:28,197 --> 00:50:30,199
That goes for the coloureds too.

256
00:50:30,366 --> 00:50:35,329
Ollie, I just rode in to pick up my
mail and spend a little time at Esther's.

257
00:50:35,538 --> 00:50:37,623
Never mind. I'm telling you.

258
00:50:37,790 --> 00:50:41,294
Those folks can come and go
as they like. That's the law.

259
00:50:41,461 --> 00:50:45,507
Sheriff, you got any official
complaint against me and my boys?

260
00:50:47,425 --> 00:50:50,094
We are bona fide labour recruiters...

261
00:50:50,261 --> 00:50:53,598
...employed by the Delta
Planters Association in Louisiana.

262
00:50:53,765 --> 00:50:58,520
There's a whole way of life back
there. It's going down the drain.

263
00:50:58,686 --> 00:51:00,897
We don't aim to see it frittered away.

264
00:51:01,397 --> 00:51:06,819
I don't care who you're working for. This
ain't Louisiana. You walk soft in my town.

265
00:52:09,882 --> 00:52:13,636
That's them. Deshay is
the one with the hat on.

266
00:52:13,803 --> 00:52:16,139
There's only eight of them in there.

267
00:52:16,305 --> 00:52:18,933
The other two are in the saloon.

268
00:52:19,267 --> 00:52:21,603
You studying on taking
eight in one gulp?

269
00:52:21,769 --> 00:52:25,106
Five. Three of them busy upstairs.

270
00:52:25,273 --> 00:52:28,067
Yeah, but they ain't
tied down forever.

271
00:52:28,234 --> 00:52:30,903
I just gotta catch them off guard.

272
00:52:33,156 --> 00:52:35,367
Let me talk to them.

273
00:52:36,951 --> 00:52:39,120
You'll catch them off guard.

274
00:52:50,173 --> 00:52:53,343
Blessings on this house!

275
00:52:53,843 --> 00:52:58,389
I am Rev. Willis Oakes Rutherford
of the Holiness Persuasion Church.

276
00:52:58,598 --> 00:53:00,433
Get the hell out of here!

277
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:04,229
You do recollect we've
encountered each other previous?

278
00:53:07,607 --> 00:53:09,234
- It's that old preacher.
- Yes!

279
00:53:09,442 --> 00:53:11,903
I run a selective house.
This ain't New Orleans.

280
00:53:12,111 --> 00:53:13,362
Shut up.

281
00:53:14,989 --> 00:53:17,617
- What you want?
- Well, sir...

282
00:53:17,784 --> 00:53:23,790
You do recall there was an old silly you
was interested in by the name of Buck?

283
00:53:25,917 --> 00:53:27,377
You know where he is?

284
00:53:27,835 --> 00:53:30,588
They have eyes that see
not until they are open!

285
00:53:30,797 --> 00:53:33,341
Don't trifle with me.

286
00:53:33,508 --> 00:53:35,719
I ain't trifling, sir.

287
00:53:35,885 --> 00:53:40,473
But I do seem to remember
that there was a sum mentioned.

288
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:43,893
- Five hundred dollars to be exact.
- Where is he?

289
00:53:44,060 --> 00:53:49,107
Yea, though he flees as a shadow, yet
will I lead thee to him but for $500.

290
00:53:49,315 --> 00:53:51,859
Look, I ain't gonna bargain with you.

291
00:53:52,026 --> 00:53:56,072
You tell us where he's at, and
maybe we'll talk about money.

292
00:53:56,280 --> 00:53:58,699
Get him out of my house!
I've got a reputation.

293
00:53:58,908 --> 00:54:02,412
Thy suffers that woman Jezebel,
who calleth herself a prophetess...

294
00:54:02,578 --> 00:54:05,998
...to teach and to seduce
my servants into fornication.

295
00:54:06,165 --> 00:54:07,541
Revelation, Chapter 2.

296
00:54:07,750 --> 00:54:09,961
What the hell is he doing here?

297
00:54:10,128 --> 00:54:11,171
He's a-preaching.

298
00:54:11,379 --> 00:54:14,632
That's right, brother, I'm
preaching. And my text is fornication.

299
00:54:14,799 --> 00:54:19,012
He that committeth fornication, sinneth
against his own body. Corinthians 1.

300
00:54:19,220 --> 00:54:21,431
That's you, Esther!

301
00:54:21,639 --> 00:54:23,391
That's you, Esther!

302
00:54:23,558 --> 00:54:26,144
Fornication! That's
the way to ruination.

303
00:54:26,310 --> 00:54:29,146
Fornication. That's the way
they's taught the nation.

304
00:54:30,606 --> 00:54:33,609
You keep up that fornicating,
I'll take you to ruination.

305
00:54:37,321 --> 00:54:41,700
Rich man marries, him abate. Poor
man, he just fornicates. Yes, sir.

306
00:54:47,498 --> 00:54:52,086
He's coming, and he's waiting.
He's got no time for fornicating.

307
00:54:56,549 --> 00:54:58,843
I'm Buck.

308
00:55:27,121 --> 00:55:30,333
I put my faith in the Good Book.

309
00:56:44,907 --> 00:56:47,410
Ain't no more than $100 here.

310
00:56:47,577 --> 00:56:49,996
I got about 30.

311
00:56:58,338 --> 00:57:01,675
Where's the money? Where is it?

312
00:57:15,688 --> 00:57:17,899
- The money!
- They're coming, Buck!

313
00:57:18,816 --> 00:57:21,235
I'm talking to you. Where is it?

314
00:57:21,402 --> 00:57:23,738
Come on, Buck, we've got to move!

315
00:57:35,416 --> 00:57:37,543
Come on, Preacher.

316
00:57:37,710 --> 00:57:39,712
Stick to thine, Jesus.

317
00:59:09,135 --> 00:59:11,304
Will you hurry up?

318
00:59:22,648 --> 00:59:25,985
Are they gonna track us
through four miles of sheep dip?

319
00:59:26,194 --> 00:59:30,490
They don't have to. They know where I've
got to go. They've been there before.

320
00:59:31,240 --> 00:59:35,202
$157! They drunk up and
screwed away more than $1000!

321
00:59:36,954 --> 00:59:39,290
That's a lot of drinking.

322
00:59:41,042 --> 00:59:43,336
And they didn't even have my 500.

323
00:59:44,295 --> 00:59:45,755
What 500?

324
00:59:46,964 --> 00:59:49,884
What they was gonna
pay me to deliver you.

325
00:59:54,180 --> 00:59:56,224
Well, I'm here, ain't I?

326
00:59:56,391 --> 00:59:58,685
And they's dead, ain't they?

327
01:00:06,859 --> 01:00:08,277
Yeah.

328
01:01:03,791 --> 01:01:06,335
Buck. Jesus!

329
01:01:09,881 --> 01:01:11,257
You all right?

330
01:01:11,466 --> 01:01:13,677
I ran to Anne Pennybegger's.
She took me in.

331
01:01:13,843 --> 01:01:17,680
- They didn't hurt you none?
- Cuff me on the head some. That's all.

332
01:01:22,268 --> 01:01:24,896
They hit the St. Ann Parish people.

333
01:01:25,063 --> 01:01:28,275
They killed some, and
they burned them out.

334
01:01:28,483 --> 01:01:30,777
- You better rest.
- I ain't got no time.

335
01:01:30,943 --> 01:01:33,946
- I didn't know if you was alive or dead.
- I couldn't come back.

336
01:01:34,113 --> 01:01:37,325
- They could've been waiting.
- I know.

337
01:01:42,997 --> 01:01:45,124
Horses are in the thicket.

338
01:01:47,543 --> 01:01:50,629
That's Ruth. Ruth, this is Preacher.

339
01:01:53,466 --> 01:01:55,718
Your servant, ma'am.

340
01:01:57,762 --> 01:02:00,431
Y'all sit down. I'll
get you something to eat.

341
01:02:16,739 --> 01:02:18,658
Where can we get horses around here?

342
01:02:18,825 --> 01:02:20,702
Elias Pennybegger has horses.

343
01:02:20,910 --> 01:02:23,496
Don't worry. We can trust
them. She's my friend.

344
01:02:27,291 --> 01:02:30,628
- How many horses?
- At least one for you.

345
01:02:32,171 --> 01:02:34,632
They've been here once.
They can come again.

346
01:02:34,799 --> 01:02:38,886
- They still after you?
- Not all of them. Some dead.

347
01:02:39,053 --> 01:02:41,681
Eight to be exact.

348
01:02:42,640 --> 01:02:44,892
We going north like
we said, to Canada?

349
01:02:45,476 --> 01:02:49,563
No, we can't. Not yet.

350
01:02:50,064 --> 01:02:52,024
Well, why not?

351
01:02:53,026 --> 01:02:54,945
Where we going?

352
01:02:55,403 --> 01:02:59,616
You done what you could in this country,
and it all end on fire, in the grave.

353
01:02:59,782 --> 01:03:02,410
I ain't gonna live in this
land no more. You hear me?

354
01:03:02,618 --> 01:03:04,161
The war ain't changed nothing.

355
01:03:04,579 --> 01:03:09,000
It's like a poison
soaked into the ground.

356
01:03:09,167 --> 01:03:13,046
They ain't gonna give us nothing.
Not no 40 acres and no mule.

357
01:03:13,212 --> 01:03:15,172
And not freedom, neither.

358
01:03:15,340 --> 01:03:19,261
It's like a poison
soaked into the ground.

359
01:03:25,558 --> 01:03:30,605
The time is going. I don't wanna spend
my life washing other people's clothes.

360
01:03:30,772 --> 01:03:33,984
I wanna live somewhere with
you, like natural people.

361
01:03:34,192 --> 01:03:36,861
I wanna have your children
and raise them someplace...

362
01:03:37,028 --> 01:03:39,948
...where there ain't
even a shadow of slavery.

363
01:03:40,114 --> 01:03:45,578
I think about sewing, making
pretty things for my family...

364
01:03:45,745 --> 01:03:48,039
...while my hands are still steady.

365
01:03:55,004 --> 01:03:57,173
I wanna go someplace with you.

366
01:03:57,340 --> 01:03:59,509
I wanna have your children.

367
01:03:59,676 --> 01:04:01,761
But I won't have them here.

368
01:04:02,804 --> 01:04:05,473
I am going somewhere.

369
01:04:07,809 --> 01:04:10,395
They won't have us in Canada...

370
01:04:10,561 --> 01:04:15,357
...l'll go to the edge of the ocean,
and I'll walks on away from here.

371
01:04:19,654 --> 01:04:22,699
St. Ann Parish folk...

372
01:04:25,326 --> 01:04:29,330
They're heading out there, and
they ain't got no food, no seed.

373
01:04:30,373 --> 01:04:33,376
And they starve when the winter come.

374
01:04:33,543 --> 01:04:36,046
Buck, honey, you just one man.

375
01:04:36,963 --> 01:04:39,048
But I gave my word.

376
01:04:48,850 --> 01:04:51,102
Eat your food.

377
01:04:56,774 --> 01:04:59,151
I'll go see about the horses.

378
01:05:46,074 --> 01:05:47,742
What you studying, honey?

379
01:05:50,119 --> 01:05:53,122
Troubled about all that killing.

380
01:05:56,376 --> 01:05:58,545
I killed men before.

381
01:05:59,879 --> 01:06:03,508
I just don't know which way to
turn no more. I think they beat me.

382
01:06:06,135 --> 01:06:11,932
Drivers couldn't do it in slavery days, nor
the rebels in the war, but now I think...

383
01:06:12,308 --> 01:06:14,310
...they beat me.

384
01:06:16,938 --> 01:06:18,440
You're just tired.

385
01:06:19,816 --> 01:06:24,612
When it's dark, looks like the
heart just gets to hurting sometimes.

386
01:06:25,697 --> 01:06:28,450
You gonna keep on
fighting best way you can.

387
01:06:28,616 --> 01:06:32,120
Looks like there just
ain't no other way.

388
01:06:33,413 --> 01:06:36,082
I love you, Buck.

389
01:07:06,779 --> 01:07:09,323
Where'd you get them cannons?

390
01:07:11,534 --> 01:07:13,995
Gunsmith in Fort Leavenworth.

391
01:07:15,204 --> 01:07:17,206
Where'd you get that funny Bible?

392
01:07:18,791 --> 01:07:21,585
Well, that my inheritance.

393
01:07:21,753 --> 01:07:23,755
Before the war, when I was a boy...

394
01:07:23,921 --> 01:07:26,590
...my mama and me was sold
to a travelling preacher.

395
01:07:26,799 --> 01:07:29,552
I'd fetch for him and
take up collection.

396
01:07:29,719 --> 01:07:32,263
And when he got drunk,
I'd haul him off to bed.

397
01:07:32,638 --> 01:07:35,891
He travelled in little towns,
preaching sin and hellfire.

398
01:07:36,059 --> 01:07:38,603
When he got them gals
full of the Holy Spirit...

399
01:07:38,770 --> 01:07:41,564
...when they're ready to
repent, he'd jerk them.

400
01:07:41,898 --> 01:07:43,691
Between wiles...

401
01:07:43,858 --> 01:07:46,319
...he'd take my mama to bed.

402
01:07:46,486 --> 01:07:48,697
And I'd sleep out with the horse.

403
01:07:49,614 --> 01:07:54,410
By and by, about 16, he sent
me to town for a jug of whiskey.

404
01:07:54,577 --> 01:07:56,662
When I come back, my mama was gone.

405
01:07:56,871 --> 01:07:59,332
He sold her for a
couple hundred dollars.

406
01:08:01,376 --> 01:08:04,045
He got drunk that night, and he said:

407
01:08:04,212 --> 01:08:06,881
"Boy, put me to bed."

408
01:08:08,925 --> 01:08:12,971
So I lead that man into the
tanning yard by the lime pit.

409
01:08:13,137 --> 01:08:15,598
And I put him to bed right there.

410
01:08:15,765 --> 01:08:18,393
I hold him under with
a cedar fence rail.

411
01:08:24,148 --> 01:08:26,150
There was no next of kin.

412
01:08:26,317 --> 01:08:29,237
So I got the cart, the horse...

413
01:08:30,780 --> 01:08:33,866
Preacher clothes and this funny Bible.

414
01:08:37,578 --> 01:08:40,456
Where are you gonna find that money?

415
01:08:42,625 --> 01:08:44,669
I don't know.

416
01:08:46,879 --> 01:08:50,758
If it was me, I'd look for
money where money's kept.

417
01:08:50,925 --> 01:08:53,886
Like in a bank or an Express office.

418
01:08:56,097 --> 01:08:58,725
We gonna walk in the
bank and just take it?

419
01:08:58,933 --> 01:09:01,102
That's right, brother.

420
01:09:02,562 --> 01:09:04,564
And I know just the place.

421
01:09:05,606 --> 01:09:09,193
Where they ain't got no sheriff,
no deputy and hardly any men...

422
01:09:09,652 --> 01:09:14,323
...because they out in the countryside
chasing two poor field hands.

423
01:09:14,490 --> 01:09:17,118
You're crazy.

424
01:09:18,619 --> 01:09:20,538
Yeah.

425
01:11:02,473 --> 01:11:04,684
What you want, boy?

426
01:11:08,396 --> 01:11:10,732
You make a sound,
and you're a dead man.

427
01:12:00,698 --> 01:12:02,950
We ain't got all day.

428
01:12:12,585 --> 01:12:14,796
What's in the box?

429
01:12:14,962 --> 01:12:17,965
- What's in the box?
- U.S. Government shipment.

430
01:12:20,093 --> 01:12:22,012
Shipment of what?

431
01:12:23,137 --> 01:12:24,722
What?

432
01:12:25,264 --> 01:12:26,515
Gold.

433
01:12:29,310 --> 01:12:31,062
Gold.

434
01:12:31,729 --> 01:12:33,731
Sweet God Almighty, that's gold.

435
01:12:35,608 --> 01:12:39,028
- Where's the paper money?
- There isn't any.

436
01:12:39,195 --> 01:12:41,989
I sent the cash deposit
over to the bank.

437
01:12:42,532 --> 01:12:44,826
Will you get off that?!

438
01:12:44,992 --> 01:12:49,622
- That's a whole mess of gold.
- You can't carry it on a horse.

439
01:12:49,789 --> 01:12:52,292
Where's the key?
There's got to be a key!

440
01:12:52,500 --> 01:12:55,294
It's in Texas. They always
send the key separate.

441
01:12:55,461 --> 01:12:58,631
He's telling the truth, but
there's got to be paper money.

442
01:12:58,798 --> 01:13:02,385
I'm gonna ask you for the last
time. Where is that paper money?

443
01:13:03,344 --> 01:13:05,179
I told you.

444
01:13:05,346 --> 01:13:09,350
At the bank. I sent it over there.

445
01:13:12,186 --> 01:13:15,106
- What do you think?
- What the hell?

446
01:13:15,273 --> 01:13:18,777
Otherwise, we done
wasted the whole morning.

447
01:13:57,440 --> 01:14:00,276
Posse's riding by.
Sheriff's with them.

448
01:14:10,119 --> 01:14:11,787
Well, that's it.

449
01:14:11,954 --> 01:14:15,166
- Let's get out of here.
- Preacher.

450
01:14:17,669 --> 01:14:21,965
- I'm going to that bank.
- It's across from the sheriff's office!

451
01:14:23,383 --> 01:14:26,511
There's an awful lot
of money down there.

452
01:14:27,011 --> 01:14:29,347
Otherwise, we done
wasted the whole morning.

453
01:14:29,806 --> 01:14:32,225
You're the one that's crazy.

454
01:16:52,365 --> 01:16:56,786
- Morning, Miss Esther. How you feeling?
- Some better, thanks.

455
01:16:56,953 --> 01:17:00,623
Thing like that's not easy
to forget, but life goes on.

456
01:17:00,790 --> 01:17:03,293
- My money good enough for you?
- Money's money.

457
01:17:03,459 --> 01:17:05,461
Hard-earned too.

458
01:17:05,628 --> 01:17:08,422
Wages of sin, just so's
I get 3 percent on them.

459
01:17:10,341 --> 01:17:12,927
I got stuck with Ohio bank
notes. Are they any good?

460
01:17:13,094 --> 01:17:16,097
That depends on the solvency
of that particular...

461
01:19:02,954 --> 01:19:05,373
Hold up! Hold up!

462
01:21:21,676 --> 01:21:23,469
They're gonna get away!

463
01:21:23,636 --> 01:21:25,096
Yeah.

464
01:21:27,181 --> 01:21:29,975
You shoot that rifle,
boy, and we're dead!

465
01:21:30,143 --> 01:21:32,854
You gonna quit?

466
01:21:33,771 --> 01:21:36,357
- Remember that wagon train you shot up?
- Yeah.

467
01:21:36,524 --> 01:21:38,276
They never did come back.

468
01:21:38,443 --> 01:21:40,820
I wonder if they're
joining up with them.

469
01:22:28,284 --> 01:22:32,038
- He say he will not fight them for you.
- I understand.

470
01:22:32,205 --> 01:22:36,167
Tell him I just need help
to get through to my people.

471
01:22:40,088 --> 01:22:42,966
They need supplies, and I can pay.

472
01:22:43,132 --> 01:22:46,636
Dried meat, as much as he can
sell them. Horses, powder and shot.

473
01:22:53,518 --> 01:22:54,978
Five horses.

474
01:22:56,062 --> 01:22:58,231
No powder.

475
01:22:58,398 --> 01:23:00,317
No guns.

476
01:23:03,778 --> 01:23:05,238
Ask him again.

477
01:23:05,405 --> 01:23:07,866
Tell him we're all brothers.

478
01:23:08,074 --> 01:23:10,910
He will not give you
guns. They come too hard.

479
01:23:11,119 --> 01:23:13,496
- Food.
- Dried meat.

480
01:23:14,622 --> 01:23:17,166
Flour. Corn.

481
01:23:17,375 --> 01:23:18,501
Do not ask for more.

482
01:23:18,668 --> 01:23:22,463
He stopped that posse because he
gave his word to let you through safe.

483
01:23:22,630 --> 01:23:26,175
- He will do no more.
- Ask him again.

484
01:23:26,884 --> 01:23:30,846
Tell him they looking for their own
land, and they'll have to fight for it...

485
01:23:31,014 --> 01:23:33,975
...because they can't
live back there, no way.

486
01:23:58,291 --> 01:24:02,420
Before the yellow hair, my father,
my grandfather hunted buffalo...

487
01:24:02,628 --> 01:24:05,172
...raised pony and took
women on the land...

488
01:24:05,340 --> 01:24:08,969
...where Fox River crosses the
grassland at Place of Skull.

489
01:24:09,177 --> 01:24:12,472
Now Copper Spring, Fort Sheridan.

490
01:24:21,022 --> 01:24:24,859
Now we are here with our
backs against Snow Mountain.

491
01:24:31,366 --> 01:24:35,829
And yellow hair send wagon,
soldier and speaking wire.

492
01:24:42,502 --> 01:24:44,421
Tomorrow we will be like ghosts.

493
01:24:44,587 --> 01:24:48,132
Like the spirits that come in
dreams with no earth to walk on.

494
01:24:51,469 --> 01:24:53,429
But we will fight.

495
01:25:03,106 --> 01:25:07,652
We will fight ten tens of years, and
our children's children will fight.

496
01:25:07,860 --> 01:25:12,656
We need our guns, bullets
and powder for our own fight.

497
01:25:13,116 --> 01:25:16,119
Tell him his enemies are our enemies.

498
01:25:28,256 --> 01:25:34,137
He say you black people fought
with that enemy against our people.

499
01:25:35,430 --> 01:25:37,432
I ain't in the Army no more.

500
01:25:37,640 --> 01:25:39,809
He knows, Buck.

501
01:25:40,435 --> 01:25:42,228
No guns.

502
01:25:42,395 --> 01:25:44,147
No bullets.

503
01:26:10,965 --> 01:26:13,634
Eighteen hundred dollars.
That's your share.

504
01:26:22,477 --> 01:26:27,190
For what we have just received, we
give thanks. In Jesus' name, amen.

505
01:26:30,777 --> 01:26:34,864
I'm going back East to Illinois,
and I'm gonna buy me a tent.

506
01:26:35,031 --> 01:26:38,701
I'm gonna have the biggest revival
meeting since King Solomon...

507
01:26:38,868 --> 01:26:41,871
...preached to his wives
and concubines. Amen.

508
01:26:42,038 --> 01:26:45,750
And you, brother, you
got a good woman there.

509
01:26:45,917 --> 01:26:51,464
Take that money and buy yourself a
living and do like she want. Go to Canada.

510
01:26:53,925 --> 01:26:55,885
All right, brother.

511
01:26:56,052 --> 01:26:57,637
One question.

512
01:26:57,804 --> 01:26:59,681
How do I get out of here?

513
01:26:59,847 --> 01:27:01,349
To Illinois?

514
01:27:01,557 --> 01:27:06,520
One of two ways. Go on back the
way we come and on across Kansas.

515
01:27:06,688 --> 01:27:09,941
- There's a posse with a trigger hitch.
- Yes, there is.

516
01:27:10,108 --> 01:27:12,068
What's the other way?

517
01:27:12,276 --> 01:27:14,820
Keep on west, across the
Pecos to where I'm going.

518
01:27:14,987 --> 01:27:17,990
Into the mountains and north
along the Idaho Territory...

519
01:27:18,199 --> 01:27:20,159
...then back by the Canadian border.

520
01:27:20,326 --> 01:27:22,370
- How long that take?
- All winter.

521
01:27:22,537 --> 01:27:26,708
All winter. What's my chances
of sneaking past the posse?

522
01:27:27,291 --> 01:27:29,084
Not much.

523
01:27:30,253 --> 01:27:32,380
When I caught you eating my rabbit...

524
01:27:32,547 --> 01:27:37,844
...I should've got me a rock, busted you
upside your head and left you for dead.

525
01:28:31,356 --> 01:28:34,192
Scout come in. That
posse did not go back.

526
01:28:34,400 --> 01:28:37,695
- They're tracking the wagon train.
- How close are they to it?

527
01:28:38,029 --> 01:28:40,365
One-day ride from the big river.

528
01:28:40,573 --> 01:28:43,868
How long will it take us to catch
them, riding straight through?

529
01:28:53,461 --> 01:28:59,384
Maybe two days. He will give you guides
to take you through the high pass.

530
01:29:03,262 --> 01:29:05,514
Remember, they will not fight for you.

531
01:29:07,016 --> 01:29:08,809
I know.

532
01:29:27,245 --> 01:29:29,414
Looks like the back door's open.

533
01:29:29,580 --> 01:29:33,084
Figure I can skate on
through and take my chances.

534
01:29:34,752 --> 01:29:39,882
You done walked more than half the
journey with the St. Ann Parish folk.

535
01:29:40,049 --> 01:29:44,053
That's all a normal man can do.
What do you wanna die for them for?

536
01:30:45,073 --> 01:30:48,577
What happened? Somebody
close the back door?

537
01:31:01,130 --> 01:31:04,216
If they're gonna join up with
them, they'll do it before sundown.

538
01:31:04,384 --> 01:31:06,386
Let's finish off that wagon train.

539
01:31:06,552 --> 01:31:09,430
They ain't broke any
laws I know about.

540
01:31:09,806 --> 01:31:14,060
- We gotta turn them around.
- What you got against them folks?

541
01:31:14,227 --> 01:31:17,272
You on their side? You
soft in the head for them?

542
01:31:17,438 --> 01:31:20,691
- They killed Uncle Beau, robbed the bank.
- They didn't!

543
01:31:20,858 --> 01:31:25,071
Buck and that preacher did.
And that's all we're after.

544
01:31:26,280 --> 01:31:30,201
You don't understand. I gotta
turn them field hands around.

545
01:31:31,452 --> 01:31:35,331
If we leave them fields go
fallow now, we done lost it all.

546
01:31:35,498 --> 01:31:39,460
We gotta keep it going like it
was, the way they rightfully belong.

547
01:31:39,627 --> 01:31:43,005
You got 16 white men
down there. Sixteen.

548
01:31:43,172 --> 01:31:48,010
You just give me half of
them, and I'll finish that job.

549
01:31:48,302 --> 01:31:53,641
As far as I'm concerned, that wagon
train can go anywhere it likes!

550
01:31:56,644 --> 01:31:59,272
And you make one move
against those people...

551
01:31:59,439 --> 01:32:04,402
...I'll take you to Copper Springs with
you tied under the belly of your horse.

552
01:32:25,131 --> 01:32:28,801
- Where's Ollie?
- He went to cover the pass.

553
01:32:29,260 --> 01:32:31,637
He'll say, "boo," if
that Buck comes through.

554
01:32:32,180 --> 01:32:35,392
- What does he want us to do?
- Take the wagon train.

555
01:32:38,478 --> 01:32:41,064
Well, if that's what he said...

556
01:32:41,272 --> 01:32:43,316
Let's go!

557
01:33:12,970 --> 01:33:15,806
- You gonna have to take it to them.
- What you gonna do?

558
01:33:16,015 --> 01:33:17,683
- We can draw them south.
- But...

559
01:33:17,850 --> 01:33:21,520
You go with the wagon train.
I'll come to you later.

560
01:34:52,862 --> 01:34:56,574
Get up on top. Go around in
front of them and cut them off!

561
01:38:13,229 --> 01:38:15,189
I run out.

562
01:38:16,232 --> 01:38:26,659
