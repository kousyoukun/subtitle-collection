1
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:29,020
Ice Age

2
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:58,280
Why not call it
the Big Chill or the Nippy era?

3
00:03:58,350 --> 00:04:01,380
I'm just saying,
how do we know it's an ice age?

4
00:04:01,490 --> 00:04:04,110
Because of all the ice.

5
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:09,080
Well, things just got a little chillier.

6
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:12,760
Help. Help.

7
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:16,160
Come on, kids, let's go. The traffic's moving.

8
00:04:16,530 --> 00:04:18,560
But, but, but, Dad.

9
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:21,470
No buts. You can play extinction later.

10
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:25,160
OK. Come on, guys.

11
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:27,540
So, where's Eddie?

12
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:31,430
He said he was on the verge
of an evolutionary breakthrough.

13
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,540
Really?

14
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:36,750
I'm flying.

15
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:40,250
Some breakthrough.

16
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,920
- Look out.
- You're going the wrong way.

17
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:46,990
Crazy mammoth.

18
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:58,540
Do the world a favor.
Move your issues off the road.

19
00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:03,070
If my trunk was that small,
I wouldn't draw attention to myself, pal.

20
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:06,880
Give me a break.
We've been waddling all day.

21
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:11,450
Go ahead. Follow the crowd.

22
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,750
It'll be quieter when you're gone.

23
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:17,880
Come on. If he wants to
freeze to death, let him.

24
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:30,070
I'm up. I'm up.

25
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:37,300
Rise and shine, everybody.
Huh? Zak? Marshall?

26
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:40,680
Bertie? Uncle Fungus?

27
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:47,510
Where is everybody? Come on, guys,
we're gonna miss the migration.

28
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:54,480
They left without me.
They do this every year.

29
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:59,490
Why? Doesn't anyone love me?

30
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:04,190
Isn't there anyone who cares
about Sid the Sloth?

31
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,040
All right, I'll just go by myself.

32
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:13,340
Sick.

33
00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:16,110
Wide body, curb it next time.

34
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:18,710
Oh, jeez. Yuck.

35
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:24,620
I can't believe it. Fresh wild greens.
Frank, where did you ever...?

36
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:27,860
- Go ahead. Dig in.
- A dandelion.

37
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:31,530
- I thought the frost wiped 'em all out.
- All but one.

38
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:36,770
It makes me so... I wanna... Yuck.

39
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:41,700
This has definitely not been my day.
You know what I'm saying, buddy?

40
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:45,510
What a mess. You rhinos
have tiny brains. Did you know that?

41
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:51,340
It's just a fact. No offense. You probably
didn't even know what I'm talking about.

42
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:52,720
Yummo.

43
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:55,920
A dandelion. Must be
the last one of the season.

44
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,360
- Carl.
- Easy, Frank.

45
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:03,490
He ruined our salad.

46
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:07,670
My mistake. That was my mistake. Let me...

47
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:12,030
No, no, seriously, let me
take care of this. What is this?

48
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:15,810
Pine cones. Oh, my goodness.
They're my favorite.

49
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:22,210
Delicious. That's good eating.

50
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:25,810
But don't let me hog them all up.
Here, you have some.

51
00:07:25,890 --> 00:07:28,690

52
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:32,220
Now?

53
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:34,760
Now?

54
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:47,700
- Just pretend that I'm not here.
- I wanted to hit him at full speed.

55
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:53,070
- That's OK. We'll have some fun with him.
- Don't let them impale me. I wanna live.

56
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:56,510
- Get off me.
- Come on, you're making a scene.

57
00:07:56,590 --> 00:07:59,390
We'll just take our furry pinata and go.

58
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:02,480
If it's not them today,
it's someone else tomorrow.

59
00:08:02,530 --> 00:08:04,890
Well, I'd rather it not be today. OK?

60
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:08,390
We'll break your neck
so you don't feel a thing.

61
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:11,590
Wait a minute. I thought
rhinos were vegetarians.

62
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:13,830
- An excellent point.
- Shut up.

63
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:17,530
Who says we're gonna eat him
after we kill him?

64
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:20,530
I don't like animals that kill for pleasure.

65
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:24,070
- Save it for a mammal that cares.
- I'm a mammal that cares.

66
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:29,480
OK, if either of you make it across that
sinkhole in front of ya, you get the sloth.

67
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:33,440
That's right, you losers.
You take one step and you're dead.

68
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:41,260
- You were bluffing, huh?
- Yeah. Yeah, that was a bluff.

69
00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:44,160
Get him.

70
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:22,260
A dandelion?

71
00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:27,270
We did it.

72
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:39,440
- You have beautiful eyes.
- Get off my face.

73
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:44,750
Whoa, we make a great team.
What do you say we head south together?

74
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:47,350
Great. Jump on my back
and relax the whole way.

75
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:49,460
- Wow, really?
- No.

76
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:54,060
Wait, aren't you going south?
The change of seasons, migration instincts.

77
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:56,900
- Any of this a-ringing a bell?
- I guess not. Bye.

78
00:09:56,970 --> 00:09:59,900
OK, then. Thanks for the help.
I can take it from here.

79
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:04,680
You overgrown weasel.
Wait till we get down there.

80
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:09,240
That south thing is way overrated.
The heat, the crowds - who needs it?

81
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:13,880
Isn't this great? You and me,
two bachelors knocking about in the wild.

82
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:17,780
No, you just want a bodyguard
so you don't become somebody's side dish.

83
00:10:17,930 --> 00:10:20,260
You're a very shrewd mammal.

84
00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:23,290
OK, lead the way, Mr Big...
Didn't get the name.

85
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:25,390
- Manfred.
- Manfred? Yuck.

86
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:30,740
How about Manny the Moody Mammoth?
Or Manny the Melancholy... Manny the...

87
00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:35,300
Stop following me.

88
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:42,810
OK, so you've got issues. You won't
even know I'm here. I'll just zip the lip.

89
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:30,790
Look at the cute little baby, Diego.

90
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:38,600
- lsn't it nice he'll be joining us for breakfast?
- It wouldn't be breakfast without him.

91
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:44,500
Especially since his daddy wiped out half
our pack and wears our skin to keep warm.

92
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:47,710
An eye for an eye, don't you think?

93
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:51,380
Let's show him what happens
when he messes with sabers.

94
00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:54,690
Alert the troops. We attack at dawn.

95
00:11:55,730 --> 00:12:00,320
And, Diego, bring me that baby alive.

96
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:05,650
If I'm gonna enjoy my revenge,
I want it to be fresh.

97
00:12:27,090 --> 00:12:29,250
Phew. I'm wiped out.

98
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:33,260
- That's your shelter?
- You're a big guy. You got a lotta wood.

99
00:12:33,330 --> 00:12:36,130
- I'm a little guy.
- You got half a stick.

100
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:42,590
But with my little stick and my highly
evolved brain, I shall create fire.

101
00:12:43,010 --> 00:12:44,800
Fascinating.

102
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:49,200
We'll see if brains triumph
over brawn tonight. Now, won't we?

103
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:57,480
Think I saw a spark.

104
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:04,950
Any chance I could squeeze
in there with you, Manny, ol' pal?

105
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:07,550
Isn't there someone else you can annoy?

106
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:11,230
Friends? Family? Poisonous reptiles?

107
00:13:11,570 --> 00:13:16,300
My family abandoned me.
They just kinda migrated without me.

108
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:19,040
You should see what they did last year.

109
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:21,870
They woke up early and
tied my hands and feet

110
00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:24,740
and they gagged me with a field mouse,

111
00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:28,480
covered their tracks, went
through water so I'd lose their scent,

112
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:31,390
and... who needs 'em, anyway?

113
00:13:35,930 --> 00:13:38,290
So what about you? You have family?

114
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:45,660
OK, you're tired. I see.
We'll talk more in the morning.

115
00:13:48,210 --> 00:13:51,730
Manfred? Manfred?
Could you scooch over a drop?

116
00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:55,940
Come on. Nobody falls asleep that fast.

117
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:58,070
Manny

118
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:51,080
There's Diego. Fall back.

119
00:16:57,660 --> 00:17:00,520
- Where's the baby?
- I lost it over the falls.

120
00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:03,220
You lost it?

121
00:17:06,070 --> 00:17:08,660
- I want that baby, Diego.
- I'll get it.

122
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:12,440
You'd better, unless you want to
serve as a replacement.

123
00:17:12,610 --> 00:17:15,910
We'll go up to Half Peak. Meet us there.

124
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,340
It had better be alive.

125
00:17:20,650 --> 00:17:23,140
Can we trust you with that, Diego?

126
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:25,740
Let's go.

127
00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:52,540
She picked a hair off my shoulder and says,
"lf you have an extra mating dance,

128
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:55,240
at least pick a female
with the same color pelt."

129
00:17:55,390 --> 00:17:58,780
I thought "Whoa. She's gonna go
praying mantis on me."

130
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:02,590
If you find a mate, you should be loyal.
In your case, grateful.

131
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:05,990
- Now get away from me.
- I think mating for life is stupid.

132
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:08,290
There's plenty of Sid to go around.

133
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,890
Manny?

134
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,590
Manny?

135
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:09,920
Look at that. He's OK.

136
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,900
She's gone.

137
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:36,880
- Manny, are you forgetting something?
- No.

138
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:42,280
- But you just saved him.
- I'm trying to get rid of the last thing I saved.

139
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:44,880
But you can't leave him here.

140
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:52,460
Look, there's smoke.
That's his herd right up the hill.

141
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:56,660
- We should return him.
- Let's get this straight. There is no "we."

142
00:19:56,740 --> 00:20:02,370
There never was a "we." In fact,
without me, there wouldn't even be a "you."

143
00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:10,170
- Just up the hill.
- Listen very carefully: I'm not going.

144
00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:15,350
- Fine, be a jerk. I'll take care of him.
- Yeah, that's good.

145
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:18,880
You can't even take care of yourself.
This, I gotta see.

146
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:23,250
I'll return you. We don't need
that meany-weeny mammoth, do we?

147
00:20:23,330 --> 00:20:25,490
No, we don't.

148
00:20:54,930 --> 00:20:58,320
You're an embarrassment to nature.
Do you know that?

149
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:02,170
This is cake. I'm fine, I'm fine.

150
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,260
I'm gonna die.

151
00:21:17,650 --> 00:21:19,210
Manny.

152
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:36,930
- That pink thing is mine.
- No. Actually, that pink thing belongs to us.

153
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:43,370
"Us"? You two are a bit of an odd couple.

154
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:45,280
There is no "us."

155
00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:48,700
I see. Can't have one of your own,
so you want to adopt.

156
00:21:48,790 --> 00:21:51,910
Look, I'm sorry to interrupt
your snack, but we gotta go.

157
00:21:52,090 --> 00:21:55,580
The baby? Please.
I was returning him to his herd.

158
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:57,750
Oh, yeah. Nice try, bucktooth.

159
00:21:57,830 --> 00:21:59,920
- Calling me a liar?
- I didn't say that.

160
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,090
You were thinking it.

161
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:04,760
I don't like this cat. He reads minds.

162
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:08,960
- Name's Diego, friend.
- Manfred, and I'm not your friend.

163
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:16,300
Fine, Manfred. If you're looking for the
humans, you're wasting your time. They left.

164
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:19,540
Thanks for the advice. Now beat it.

165
00:22:19,650 --> 00:22:23,710
I'll help you bring it to its herd,
but leave me alone after that.

166
00:22:23,790 --> 00:22:27,350
- OK. OK, deal. What's your problem?
- You are my problem.

167
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:31,780
I think you're stressed, so you eat too much.
It's hard to get fat on a vegan diet.

168
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:35,990
I'm not fat. It's all this fur.
It makes me look poofy.

169
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:39,990
All right, you have fat hair.
But when you're ready to talk, I'm here.

170
00:22:43,170 --> 00:22:46,530
What are you doing? Just drop it on the ledge.

171
00:22:46,610 --> 00:22:49,870
- We should make sure they found him.
- Good idea.

172
00:22:49,950 --> 00:22:52,370
No, no. Wait, wait, wait, wait.

173
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,580
Don't spear me.

174
00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:00,790
- This is a problem.
- Now what?

175
00:23:01,930 --> 00:23:04,310
That's perfect.

176
00:23:34,490 --> 00:23:37,050
- I told you they were gone.
- Look who it is.

177
00:23:37,130 --> 00:23:39,860
Don't you have some
poor animal to disembowel?

178
00:23:39,930 --> 00:23:43,750
They couldn't be far. I mean,
they went this way, or this way?

179
00:23:43,870 --> 00:23:46,200
You don't know much
about tracking, do you?

180
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:50,160
I'm a sloth. I see a tree,
eat a leaf. That's my tracking.

181
00:23:50,270 --> 00:23:52,540
You didn't miss them by much.

182
00:23:52,610 --> 00:23:56,000
It's still green.
They headed north two hours ago.

183
00:23:56,310 --> 00:24:00,480
It's still green.
They headed north two hours ago.

184
00:24:02,850 --> 00:24:05,510
You don't need this aggravation.

185
00:24:06,490 --> 00:24:10,310
Give me the baby. I can
track humans down a lot faster than you.

186
00:24:10,430 --> 00:24:13,120
And you're just a good citizen helping out?

187
00:24:13,230 --> 00:24:16,720
- I just know where the humans are going.
- Glacier Pass.

188
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:20,430
Everybody knows they have
a settlement on the other side.

189
00:24:21,370 --> 00:24:26,330
Unless you know how to track, you'll never
reach them before snow closes the pass.

190
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:29,500
Which should be, like, tomorrow.

191
00:24:29,650 --> 00:24:35,440
So, you can give that baby to me,
or go get lost in a blizzard. It's your choice.

192
00:24:42,130 --> 00:24:46,050
Here's your little bundle of joy.
We're returning it to the humans.

193
00:24:46,530 --> 00:24:52,060
The big, bad tigey-wigey gets left behind.
Poor tigey-wigey.

194
00:24:52,170 --> 00:24:54,970
Sid, tigey-wigey is gonna lead the way.

195
00:24:58,570 --> 00:25:01,200
Manny, can I talk to you for a second?

196
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:06,070
No. The sooner we find the humans,
the sooner I get rid of Mr Stinky Drool-Face,

197
00:25:06,150 --> 00:25:08,670
and the baby, too.

198
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:12,410
You won't always have
Jumbo around to protect you.

199
00:25:12,490 --> 00:25:18,120
And when that day comes, I suggest you
watch your back, cos I'll be chewing on it.

200
00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:22,020

201
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:23,760
Help me.

202
00:25:39,450 --> 00:25:43,150
You gotta make it stop.
I can't take it anymore.

203
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:47,450
- I've eaten things that complained less.
- He won't stop squirming.

204
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,650
- Watch its head.
- Put it down.

205
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:52,320
Jeez, "pick him up, put him down..."

206
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:55,890
- lts nose is dry.
- That means something's wrong with it.

207
00:25:55,970 --> 00:25:58,960
- Someone should lick it. Just in case.
- I'll do it.

208
00:25:59,070 --> 00:26:01,560
- He's wearing one of those baby thingies.
- So?

209
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:04,330
So if he poops, where does it go?

210
00:26:06,710 --> 00:26:10,700
- Humans are disgusting.
- OK, you. Check for poop.

211
00:26:10,810 --> 00:26:14,040
- Why am I the poop-checker?
- Returning him was your idea,

212
00:26:14,150 --> 00:26:17,610
you're small and insignificant,
and I'll pummel you if you don't.

213
00:26:17,690 --> 00:26:20,210
- Why else?
- Now, Sid.

214
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:30,030
I mean, my goodness.
Look out. Coming through.

215
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:32,950
- Watch out.
- Stop waving that thing around.

216
00:26:33,070 --> 00:26:35,830
I'm gonna slip.

217
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:41,540
It's clean. Got ya!

218
00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:45,840
Will you cut it out?

219
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:50,540
Do that again. He likes it.

220
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:55,780
It's making me feel better too.

221
00:26:55,890 --> 00:26:58,050
Here, you hold it.

222
00:27:04,530 --> 00:27:06,300
Turn him towards me.

223
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:08,830
Where is the baby?

224
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:12,070
There he is.

225
00:27:12,110 --> 00:27:14,970
Where is the baby?

226
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:18,670
There he is.

227
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:21,300
Stop it. You're scaring him.

228
00:27:25,490 --> 00:27:27,910
- I bet he's hungry.
- How about some milk?

229
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:31,050
- I'd love some.
- Not you. The baby.

230
00:27:31,130 --> 00:27:33,760
I aingt exactly lactating right now, pal.

231
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:36,630
- You're a little low on the food chain to...

232
00:27:36,670 --> 00:27:40,230
Enough, enough, enough.

233
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:44,830
Food.

234
00:27:53,050 --> 00:27:54,740
I don't know, but I've been told

235
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:56,910
I don't know, but I've been told

236
00:27:57,050 --> 00:27:58,920
End of the world be mighty cold

237
00:27:58,950 --> 00:28:01,150
End of the world be mighty cold

238
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:04,050
Prepare for the lce age!

239
00:28:04,130 --> 00:28:06,650
Protect the dodo way of life!

240
00:28:06,730 --> 00:28:11,020
Survival separates the dodos from the beasts!

241
00:28:12,070 --> 00:28:14,700
Protect the dodo way of life!

242
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:17,030
Prepare for the lce age!

243
00:28:17,210 --> 00:28:20,200
- lce age?
- I've heard of these crackpots.

244
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:25,640
- lntruders.
- Now, don't fall in.

245
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:29,740
- If you do, you will definitely...
- lntruders. Intruder...

246
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:33,440
..burn and die.

247
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:37,750
Can we have our melon back?
Junior's hungry and...

248
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:41,130
No way. This is our private
stockpile for the lce age.

249
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:45,360
Subarctic temperatures will force us
underground for a billion years.

250
00:28:45,470 --> 00:28:47,560
So you got three melons?

251
00:28:49,070 --> 00:28:53,100
If you weren't smart enough
to plan ahead, then doom on you.

252
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:56,870
Doom on you. Doom on you. Doom on you.

253
00:28:56,980 --> 00:28:59,070
- Get away from me.
- Doom on you.

254
00:28:59,850 --> 00:29:02,150
Oh, no. No.

255
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:06,110
Retrieve the melon.
Tae kwon dodos, attack.

256
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:19,830
- The melon.
- The melon, the melon, the melon...

257
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:25,470
There goes our last female.

258
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:36,540
- Got it, got it, got it.
- Don't got it.

259
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:40,010
The last melon.

260
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:09,840
Sid. Now we gotta find more food.

261
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:17,180
Right, more to the right. Right, right, right.

262
00:31:17,290 --> 00:31:20,950
- Look at that. Dinner and a show.
- Left, left, left.

263
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:30,920
Now to find a meal
befitting a conquering hero.

264
00:31:33,470 --> 00:31:36,860
What ho? A foe? Come on,
come on. You want a piece of me?

265
00:31:40,510 --> 00:31:42,570
Spoils worthy of such a noble...

266
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:53,780
Bedtime, squirt.

267
00:32:03,330 --> 00:32:05,900
The triumphant return.

268
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:08,270
Huh? Oh, that.

269
00:32:09,370 --> 00:32:13,760
I'm so full. How about a good-night
kiss for your big buddy, Sid?

270
00:32:14,510 --> 00:32:17,640
- He's asleep.
- I was talking to you.

271
00:32:18,510 --> 00:32:20,640
Fine, I'll tuck myself in.

272
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:30,080
All right, good night.

273
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:54,810
Will you stop it?

274
00:32:55,150 --> 00:32:57,950
All right, all right. I was trying to relax.

275
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:05,650
Oy.

276
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:57,210
- What the...?
- Slice me. It'll be the last thing you ever do.

277
00:33:57,310 --> 00:34:00,910
- I'm working here, you waste of fur.
- Frustrated, Diego?

278
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:04,010
Tracking down helpless infants
too difficult for you?

279
00:34:04,090 --> 00:34:08,510
- What are you two doing here?
- Soto's getting tired of waiting.

280
00:34:08,510 --> 00:34:13,510
Yeah, he said "Come back with the baby,
or don't come back at all."

281
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:17,430
I have a message for Soto.

282
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:20,020
Tell him I'm bringing the baby.

283
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:24,030
And tell him I'm bringing...

284
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:26,100
a mammoth.

285
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:28,900
- A mammoth?
- Mammoths never travel alone.

286
00:34:29,550 --> 00:34:33,110
This one does,
and I'm leading him to Half Peak.

287
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:36,910
Look at all that meat. Let's get him.

288
00:34:36,990 --> 00:34:41,280
Not yet. We'll need the whole pack
to bring this mammoth down.

289
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:43,450
Get everyone ready.

290
00:34:44,130 --> 00:34:46,190
Now.

291
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:12,480
- Where's the baby?
- You lost it?

292
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:15,250
Sid.

293
00:35:16,130 --> 00:35:19,860
It's so ugly. Positively adorable.

294
00:35:19,930 --> 00:35:23,820
Hello, pumpkin. Hello, little baldy bean.

295
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:27,960
- Where'd you find it?
- The poor kid, all alone in the wild.

296
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:30,300
Sabers were closing in on him.

297
00:35:30,370 --> 00:35:33,540
- So I just snatched him.
- So brave.

298
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:38,270
Yeah, well, he needed me,
and I only wish I had one of my own, too.

299
00:35:38,350 --> 00:35:42,510
Really? I find that attractive in a male.

300
00:35:42,650 --> 00:35:46,250
Alas. Who wouldn't want
a family, I always say.

301
00:35:46,860 --> 00:35:50,550
- Where've you been hiding?
- Yeah, well, you know...

302
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,780
Cute kid, huh? So, as I was saying, ladies...

303
00:35:59,930 --> 00:36:02,460
Hey. Hi, Manny.

304
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:05,460
What's the matter with you?

305
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:10,130
Excuse me, ladies. You just keep
marinating and I'll be right back.

306
00:36:12,550 --> 00:36:14,640
Sexy.

307
00:36:15,250 --> 00:36:18,450
He's not much to look at,
but it's so hard to find a family guy.

308
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:22,010
Tell me about it.
All the sensitive ones get eaten.

309
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:26,160
No, no, no. Manny, please,
I'm begging you. I need him.

310
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:29,860
- A good-looking guy like you?
- You say that, but you don't mean it.

311
00:36:30,170 --> 00:36:34,450
No, seriously. Look at you.
Those ladies, they don't stand a chance.

312
00:36:34,540 --> 00:36:38,030
- You have a cruel sense of humor.
- Don't let me cramp your style.

313
00:36:38,110 --> 00:36:41,130
- Thanks, Manny. You're a pal.
- Without Pinky.

314
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:43,570
Manny, I need him.

315
00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:50,240
So, ladies, where were we?

316
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:53,250
- Carl.
- Easy, Frank.

317
00:36:55,920 --> 00:37:00,250
Pretty tail walks by, suddenly he moves
like a cheetah. And that tiger...

318
00:37:00,330 --> 00:37:04,100
Yeah, Mr Great Tracker.
Can't even find a sloth.

319
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:08,060
What am l? The wet nurse?
What are you looking at, bone bag?

320
00:37:10,310 --> 00:37:14,040
Look at you. You're gonna
grow into a great predator.

321
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:18,830
I don't think so. What have you got?
You got a little patch of fur.

322
00:37:18,910 --> 00:37:21,470
No fangs, no claws.

323
00:37:21,550 --> 00:37:24,910
You're folds of skin wrapped in mush.

324
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:28,020
What's so threatening about you?

325
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:36,150
Does this look like
a petting zoo to you? Huh?

326
00:37:39,070 --> 00:37:42,660
OK. All right, wise guy.
You just earned a time-out.

327
00:37:45,510 --> 00:37:48,640
You think that's funny? How about this?

328
00:37:50,750 --> 00:37:53,540
You'll be a little snack for the owls.

329
00:37:55,250 --> 00:37:58,450
You're a brave little squirt, I'll give you that.

330
00:38:04,390 --> 00:38:06,090
Thank goodness. Thank goodness.
No.

331
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:09,090
A tiger.

332
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:11,690
Help. Help.

333
00:38:11,830 --> 00:38:14,030
- Where's the baby?
- Manfred has him.

334
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:18,300
Just put me in your mouth.
Come on. Hurry up. He got me.

335
00:38:19,210 --> 00:38:20,300
Help.

336
00:38:20,410 --> 00:38:23,000
- Get away from me.
- It went this way.

337
00:38:23,810 --> 00:38:26,080
Over here.

338
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:36,310
Carl. The tiger beat us to him.

339
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:40,350
Wait a minute.

340
00:38:45,330 --> 00:38:47,760
He's dead all right.

341
00:38:47,870 --> 00:38:50,030
Carnivores have all the fun.

342
00:38:52,670 --> 00:38:57,340
Gosh, I hate breaking their hearts
like that. But you know how it is.

343
00:38:58,150 --> 00:39:00,840
All right, thanks. You can put me down now.

344
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:03,480
Manny. Manny.

345
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:07,840
Guys, I thought we were in a hurry.
And Diego, spit that out.

346
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:11,020
You don't know where it's been.

347
00:39:11,090 --> 00:39:14,860
Boy. For a second there,
I thought you were gonna eat me.

348
00:39:14,930 --> 00:39:18,060
- I don't eat junk food.
- Thought you were gonna...

349
00:39:18,130 --> 00:39:20,620
I thought you were gonna... Were you?

350
00:39:23,410 --> 00:39:28,230
Come on, wait up. Wait up. Come on,
come on. Can you wait a second, please?

351
00:39:28,310 --> 00:39:30,400
Fellas.

352
00:39:31,750 --> 00:39:33,840
Thanks for waiting.

353
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:36,650
Three, two, one...

354
00:39:39,550 --> 00:39:41,650
Sure is faithful.

355
00:39:56,510 --> 00:39:58,700
- Don't make me reach back.
- He started it.

356
00:39:58,770 --> 00:40:02,040
I don't care who started it. I'll finish it.

357
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:37,730
Modern architecture. It'll never last.

358
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:54,250
Hiya, Manny.

359
00:40:56,130 --> 00:40:58,390
Hi, Diego.

360
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:07,300
Hey, Sid.

361
00:41:07,710 --> 00:41:11,480
- You're lost.
- No. I know exactly where we are.

362
00:41:11,550 --> 00:41:13,910
Ask him directions.

363
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:16,680
- I don't need directions.
- Fine, I'll ask him.

364
00:41:16,790 --> 00:41:19,880
Buddy. You see any humans go by here?

365
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:26,380
I love this game. I love this game. OK, OK.

366
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:30,960
Three words. First word.
Stomp. No, no. Stamp, stamp.

367
00:41:31,070 --> 00:41:33,200
Let me try. Pack.

368
00:41:33,370 --> 00:41:37,540
Good one, Manny.
Pack of long teeth and claws.

369
00:41:39,110 --> 00:41:41,140
Pack of wolves? Pack of...

370
00:41:41,210 --> 00:41:43,940
Pack of bears? Pack of fleas?

371
00:41:44,020 --> 00:41:46,110
Pack of whiskers? Pack of noses?

372
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:48,780
- Pachyderm?
- Pack of lies.

373
00:41:48,890 --> 00:41:51,810
Pack of troubles. Pack a wallop.
Pack of birds.

374
00:41:52,090 --> 00:41:54,150
Pack of flying fish.

375
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:44,990
Great news. I found a shortcut.

376
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:51,500
- What do you mean, shortcut?
- I mean faster than the long way around.

377
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:54,240
I know what a shortcut is.

378
00:42:54,310 --> 00:42:59,560
Either we beat the humans to Glacier Pass
or we take the long way and miss 'em.

379
00:42:59,850 --> 00:43:03,370
Through there? What do you take me for?

380
00:43:03,450 --> 00:43:06,910
This time tomorrow,
you could be a free mammoth.

381
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:10,020
Or a nanny. I never get tired of peekaboo.

382
00:43:10,190 --> 00:43:13,020
Guys. Guys. Check this out.

383
00:43:15,390 --> 00:43:17,890
Sid, the tiger found a shortcut.

384
00:43:20,030 --> 00:43:22,090
No, thanks. I choose life.

385
00:43:22,230 --> 00:43:24,830
Then I suggest you take the shortcut.

386
00:43:24,940 --> 00:43:28,790
- Are you threatening me?
- Move, sloth!

387
00:43:33,810 --> 00:43:36,300
Way to go, tiger.

388
00:43:36,350 --> 00:43:38,870
Quick. Get inside.

389
00:44:01,570 --> 00:44:04,200
OK, I vote shortcut.

390
00:44:18,790 --> 00:44:22,450
Guys, stick together.
It's easy to get lost in here.

391
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:40,140
Guys?

392
00:44:57,500 --> 00:44:59,520
A fish.

393
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:46,010
Will you keep up, please?
Hard enough to keep track of one baby.

394
00:46:31,220 --> 00:46:33,280
I gotcha.

395
00:46:49,940 --> 00:46:52,470
Captain, iceberg ahead.

396
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:00,940
Oh, no.

397
00:47:52,270 --> 00:47:55,130
Yeah. Who's up for round two?

398
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:01,100
Tell the kid to be more careful.

399
00:48:42,390 --> 00:48:45,240
Look, look. Tigers.

400
00:48:47,290 --> 00:48:52,050
No, it's OK, it's OK. Look, the tigers
are just playing tag with the antelope.

401
00:48:54,100 --> 00:48:58,630
- With their teeth.
- Come on, Sid, let's play tag.

402
00:48:58,700 --> 00:49:00,800
You're it.

403
00:49:01,940 --> 00:49:05,140
Sure. OK, OK, OK, where are the sloths?

404
00:49:05,210 --> 00:49:08,070
You never see any sloths.
Have you ever noticed?

405
00:49:08,180 --> 00:49:12,070
- Look, Manny, a mammoth.
- Somebody pinch me.

406
00:49:12,180 --> 00:49:15,040
Hey, hey, this fat one looks just like you.

407
00:49:15,950 --> 00:49:18,250
And he's got a family.

408
00:49:18,360 --> 00:49:21,750
And he's happy.
Look, he's playing with his kid.

409
00:49:21,830 --> 00:49:26,060
See? That's your problem.
That's what mammoths are supposed to do.

410
00:49:26,060 --> 00:49:28,790
- Find a she-mmoth, have baby mammoths...

411
00:49:28,790 --> 00:49:29,650
- Sid.

412
00:49:29,650 --> 00:49:31,100

413
00:49:31,160 --> 00:49:32,800
But...

414
00:52:59,910 --> 00:53:02,110
Would you look at that.

415
00:53:02,210 --> 00:53:05,240
The tiger actually did it. There's Half Peak.

416
00:53:05,380 --> 00:53:08,050
Next stop, Glacier Pass.

417
00:53:08,450 --> 00:53:12,240
- How could I ever have doubted you?
- Did you hear that, little fella?

418
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:14,420
You're almost home.

419
00:53:19,130 --> 00:53:21,660
- My feet are sweating.
- Do we need a news flash

420
00:53:21,730 --> 00:53:25,120
- every time your body does something?
- lgnore him.

421
00:53:25,240 --> 00:53:28,430
Seriously. My feet are really hot.

422
00:53:34,150 --> 00:53:36,480
Tell me that was your stomach.

423
00:53:36,550 --> 00:53:38,810
I'm sure it was just thunder.

424
00:53:39,080 --> 00:53:42,010
From underground?

425
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:04,400
Come on, keep up with me.

426
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:07,270
I would if you were moving.

427
00:54:09,650 --> 00:54:12,850
- I wish I could jump like that.
- Wish granted.

428
00:54:17,220 --> 00:54:21,610
- Come on, move faster.
- Have you noticed the river of lava?

429
00:54:40,850 --> 00:54:42,910
Hold Pinky.

430
00:55:14,410 --> 00:55:16,540
Manny.

431
00:55:27,990 --> 00:55:32,660
Manny, Manny, Manny, you OK?
Come on, come on, say something. Anything.

432
00:55:35,070 --> 00:55:37,130
What? What? I can't hear you.

433
00:55:37,300 --> 00:55:39,530
You're standing on my trunk.

434
00:55:41,610 --> 00:55:45,030
- You're OK. You're OK.
- Why did you do that?

435
00:55:45,110 --> 00:55:47,870
You could have died, trying to save me.

436
00:55:48,280 --> 00:55:50,870
That's what you do in a herd.

437
00:55:50,950 --> 00:55:53,110
You look out for each other.

438
00:55:53,290 --> 00:55:55,620
Well, thanks.

439
00:55:57,760 --> 00:56:02,280
I don't know about you guys,
but we are the weirdest herd I've ever seen.

440
00:56:20,650 --> 00:56:23,710
I can't wait to get
my claws in that mammoth.

441
00:56:23,820 --> 00:56:27,600
No one touches the mammoth
until I get that baby.

442
00:56:30,990 --> 00:56:33,650
First, I'll slice its hindquarters into sections.

443
00:56:33,730 --> 00:56:37,920
- I'll put the white meat in one pile and...
- Knock it off. I'm starving.

444
00:56:38,030 --> 00:56:41,730
Next, the shoulders. Occasionally
tough, but extremely juicy.

445
00:56:41,830 --> 00:56:45,030
- I told you to knock it off.
- Save your energy.

446
00:56:45,140 --> 00:56:48,130
Mammoths don't go down easy.

447
00:56:48,410 --> 00:56:50,700
There's only one way to do it.

448
00:56:50,840 --> 00:56:53,400
First, you have to force it into a corner.

449
00:56:54,250 --> 00:56:58,070
Cut off its retreat.
And when you three have it trapped,

450
00:56:58,320 --> 00:57:00,440
I'll go for the throat.

451
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:13,160
Guys, we gotta get this kid outta the wind.

452
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:19,700
- How much further?
- Three miles.

453
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:23,190
I'm beat. We'll get there in the morning.

454
00:57:26,310 --> 00:57:29,970
- What are you doing?
- I'm putting sloths on the map.

455
00:57:32,850 --> 00:57:36,050
Why don't you make it realistic
and draw him lying down?

456
00:57:36,120 --> 00:57:38,210
And make him rounder.

457
00:57:40,730 --> 00:57:44,510
- Perfect.
- I forgot how to laugh.

458
00:57:51,940 --> 00:57:54,030
I'm a genius.

459
00:57:57,710 --> 00:58:02,600
From now on you'll have to
refer to me as Sid, Lord of the Flame.

460
00:58:02,750 --> 00:58:06,240
Lord of the Flame, your tail's on fire.

461
00:58:14,260 --> 00:58:18,250
Thank you. From now on,
I'm gonna call you Diego.

462
00:58:18,360 --> 00:58:20,660
Lord of "Touch Me and You're Dead".

463
00:58:20,770 --> 00:58:23,890
I'm just kidding, you little knucklehead.

464
00:58:24,440 --> 00:58:26,630
Lovebirds.

465
00:58:26,770 --> 00:58:28,830
Look at this.

466
00:58:32,780 --> 00:58:34,840
I don't believe it.

467
00:58:48,290 --> 00:58:53,290
Come here, you little biped.
Come here, you little wormy-worm.

468
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:55,590
Come to Uncle Sid.

469
00:58:55,700 --> 00:58:58,730
No, no... This way. This way.

470
00:58:59,840 --> 00:59:02,470
No, no, no. No, go to him.

471
00:59:03,610 --> 00:59:05,670
Go to him.

472
00:59:08,080 --> 00:59:09,380
OK.

473
00:59:10,750 --> 00:59:14,450
Good job. Keep practicing.

474
00:59:17,390 --> 00:59:20,590
Look at that. Our little guy is growing up.

475
00:59:22,860 --> 00:59:25,890
All right, come on. Sleep time, lumpy.

476
00:59:31,570 --> 00:59:33,630
Look at that big pushover.

477
00:59:35,240 --> 00:59:39,560
You know, Diego, I've never had
a friend who would risk his life for me.

478
00:59:40,110 --> 00:59:44,340
Yeah, Manny's... he's a good guy.

479
00:59:44,780 --> 00:59:46,840
Yeah, he is.

480
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:50,010
Well, good night.

481
01:00:22,090 --> 01:00:27,650
Let's get you all cleaned up. What's your
daddy gonna say if you go back all stinky?

482
01:00:28,490 --> 01:00:32,550
Let me just clean that up.
That looks good. A little bit here.

483
01:00:32,660 --> 01:00:36,490
- You clean up nice, little fella.
- I think he's starting to look like me.

484
01:00:36,570 --> 01:00:38,700
Diego, what do you think?

485
01:00:40,370 --> 01:00:42,760
- Maybe we shouldn't do this.
- Why not?

486
01:00:42,870 --> 01:00:46,660
If we save him, he'll be a hunter.
And who do you think he'll hunt?

487
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:49,270
Maybe because we save him,
he won't hunt us.

488
01:00:49,480 --> 01:00:53,940
Yeah, and maybe he'll grow fur and
a long skinny neck and call you Mama.

489
01:00:54,520 --> 01:00:59,880
- What's your problem?
- Nothing. Let's go. I'm freezing my tail off.

490
01:01:19,210 --> 01:01:21,300
Diego. You frozen back there?

491
01:01:25,620 --> 01:01:27,610
- Get down.
- What?

492
01:01:27,690 --> 01:01:29,950
- Get down and follow me.
- What's going on?

493
01:01:30,050 --> 01:01:35,080
At the bottom of Half Peak,
there's an ambush waiting for you.

494
01:01:35,160 --> 01:01:37,490
- What?
- What do you mean, "ambush"?

495
01:01:39,700 --> 01:01:41,860
- You set us up.
- It was my job.

496
01:01:41,930 --> 01:01:45,530
- I was to get the baby, but then...
- You brought us home for dinner.

497
01:01:45,640 --> 01:01:48,440
- That's it. You're out of the herd.
- I'm sorry.

498
01:01:48,510 --> 01:01:50,570
No, you're not. Not yet.

499
01:01:50,780 --> 01:01:54,470
- Listen, I can help you.
- Stay close, Sid. We can fight our way out.

500
01:01:54,650 --> 01:01:57,840
You can't. The pack's too strong.
You have to trust me.

501
01:01:57,920 --> 01:02:01,180
Trust you? Why in the world
would we trust you?

502
01:02:01,290 --> 01:02:03,280
Because I'm your only chance.

503
01:02:16,940 --> 01:02:18,990
Hello, ladies.

504
01:02:19,840 --> 01:02:25,330
- Look who decided to show up.
- Diego, I was beginning to worry about you.

505
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:31,670
No need to worry. In about two minutes
you'll be satisfying your taste for revenge.

506
01:02:31,820 --> 01:02:33,510
Very nice.

507
01:02:33,920 --> 01:02:37,010
I see the sloth. And he's got the baby.

508
01:02:37,090 --> 01:02:42,450
Don't give away your positions until you
see the mammoth. He's the one to surprise.

509
01:02:43,700 --> 01:02:46,190
You want to maul something, don't you?

510
01:02:46,260 --> 01:02:49,760
- I wanna maul.
- Then what are you waiting for?

511
01:02:52,870 --> 01:02:55,470
No, I said wait for the mammoth.

512
01:03:17,430 --> 01:03:20,590
Backscratcher. Eat my powder!

513
01:03:36,210 --> 01:03:38,310
Loop-de-loop.

514
01:03:39,320 --> 01:03:41,480
Slalom! Slalom, baby!

515
01:04:07,110 --> 01:04:10,970
Sorry, fellas. He got a little frostbite.

516
01:04:12,620 --> 01:04:14,680
Get him.

517
01:04:17,690 --> 01:04:19,780
Surprise!

518
01:04:24,700 --> 01:04:29,400
OK, follow me. We'll pick up Sid
and get outta here while we can.

519
01:04:29,470 --> 01:04:33,430
Come on, Diego,
let's bring this mammoth down.

520
01:04:45,820 --> 01:04:48,120
There he is.

521
01:04:50,150 --> 01:04:52,650
That's right. Where's the baby?

522
01:04:56,530 --> 01:04:59,830
Survival of the fittest.

523
01:04:59,900 --> 01:05:01,850
I don't think so. Yeah.

524
01:05:13,880 --> 01:05:18,410
- What are you doing?
- Leave the mammoth alone.

525
01:05:21,320 --> 01:05:24,380
Fine. I'll take you down first.

526
01:06:40,330 --> 01:06:42,420
We did it.

527
01:06:54,080 --> 01:06:57,910
We were some team, huh?

528
01:06:58,620 --> 01:07:02,010
Were? Come on, we're still a team.

529
01:07:02,420 --> 01:07:04,980
I'm sorry I set you up.

530
01:07:05,490 --> 01:07:08,350
You know me -
I'm too lazy to hold a grudge.

531
01:07:11,700 --> 01:07:13,790
Knock it off, squirt.

532
01:07:14,700 --> 01:07:16,760
You gotta be strong.

533
01:07:17,100 --> 01:07:20,430
You have to take care of Manfred and Sid.

534
01:07:21,440 --> 01:07:23,460
Especially Sid.

535
01:07:23,570 --> 01:07:27,430
Come on, you can lick this. You're a tiger.

536
01:07:27,510 --> 01:07:30,640
Look, I'll carry you.
Come on, what do you say?

537
01:07:30,780 --> 01:07:33,050
Come on, Diego, come on.

538
01:07:33,120 --> 01:07:35,280
Tell him he's going to be OK, Manny.

539
01:07:36,850 --> 01:07:40,520
Listen, you have to leave me here.

540
01:07:40,630 --> 01:07:44,820
If those humans get through the pass,
you'll never catch them.

541
01:07:45,460 --> 01:07:48,520
You didn't have to do that.

542
01:07:48,630 --> 01:07:51,400
That's what you do in a herd.

543
01:11:07,130 --> 01:11:09,220
Don't forget about us.

544
01:11:09,300 --> 01:11:11,390
OK?

545
01:11:13,640 --> 01:11:16,330
We won't forget about you.

546
01:11:56,050 --> 01:11:58,670
Goodbye.

547
01:11:58,820 --> 01:12:01,250
Goodbye.Goodbye.

548
01:12:01,350 --> 01:12:03,650
- Sid...
- Bye.

549
01:12:05,120 --> 01:12:07,110
Bye.

550
01:12:09,830 --> 01:12:12,250
That's right. Where's the baby?

551
01:12:12,400 --> 01:12:14,890
Come on, Sid, let's head south.

552
01:12:32,980 --> 01:12:34,970
Bye.

553
01:12:36,050 --> 01:12:39,550
Save your breath, Sid.
You know humans can't talk.

554
01:12:40,060 --> 01:12:42,120
Diego? You're OK.

555
01:12:42,260 --> 01:12:44,350
- Nine lives, baby.
- You're OK.

556
01:12:45,630 --> 01:12:47,720
You're OK.

557
01:12:48,330 --> 01:12:50,430
I could kiss ya.

558
01:12:52,070 --> 01:12:54,330
Welcome back, partner. Wanna lift?

559
01:12:54,440 --> 01:12:57,430
No thanks. I gotta save
whatever dignity I've got left.

560
01:12:57,580 --> 01:13:02,070
You're hanging out with us. Dignity's
got nothing to do with it. I'll take that lift.

561
01:13:02,450 --> 01:13:04,610
- Yeah, climb aboard.
- Pick me up, buddy.

562
01:13:04,680 --> 01:13:08,710
Mush. Or not mush. Either way.

563
01:13:12,420 --> 01:13:15,050
This is gonna be the best migration ever.

564
01:13:15,130 --> 01:13:20,050
I'll show you my favorite watering holes.
I turn brown when the fungus in my fur dries.

565
01:13:20,130 --> 01:13:23,920
- Attractive.
- This whole lce age thing is getting old.

566
01:13:24,030 --> 01:13:27,390
You know what I could go for?
Global warming.

567
01:13:27,470 --> 01:13:30,530
- Keep dreaming.
- No, really...

568
01:13:36,350 --> 01:13:40,700
20,000 Years Later
