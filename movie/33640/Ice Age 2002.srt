1
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:55,490
Why not call it
the Big Chill or the Nippy era?

2
00:03:55,574 --> 00:03:58,618
I'm just sayin',
how do we know it's an Ice age?

3
00:03:58,701 --> 00:04:01,412
Because of all the ice.

4
00:04:03,873 --> 00:04:06,375
Well, things just got a little chillier.

5
00:04:06,459 --> 00:04:10,046
Help. Help.

6
00:04:10,129 --> 00:04:13,465
Come on, kids, let's go. The traffic's movin'.

7
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:15,843
But, but, but, Dad.

8
00:04:15,968 --> 00:04:18,720
No buts. You can play extinction later.

9
00:04:19,054 --> 00:04:22,474
OK. Come on, guys.

10
00:04:22,724 --> 00:04:24,768
So, where's Eddie?

11
00:04:24,893 --> 00:04:28,646
He said he was on the verge
of an evolutionary breakthrough.

12
00:04:28,772 --> 00:04:30,857
Really?

13
00:04:31,357 --> 00:04:34,027
I'm flying.

14
00:04:35,319 --> 00:04:37,446
Some breakthrough.

15
00:04:38,614 --> 00:04:41,158
- Look out.
- You're going the wrong way.

16
00:04:42,159 --> 00:04:44,245
Crazy mammoth.

17
00:04:51,043 --> 00:04:55,755
Do the world a favour.
Move your issues off the road.

18
00:04:56,131 --> 00:05:00,385
If my trunk was that small,
I wouldn't draw attention to myself, pal.

19
00:05:00,552 --> 00:05:04,180
Give me a break.
We've been waddlin' all day.

20
00:05:05,973 --> 00:05:08,768
Go ahead. Follow the crowd.

21
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:11,061
It'll be quieter when you're gone.

22
00:05:12,354 --> 00:05:15,190
Come on. If he wants to
freeze to death, let him.

23
00:05:25,242 --> 00:05:27,327
I'm up. I'm up.

24
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:35,126
Rise and shine, everybody.
Huh? Zak? Marshall?

25
00:05:35,209 --> 00:05:37,920
Bertie? Uncle Fungus?

26
00:05:38,546 --> 00:05:44,760
Where is everybody? Come on, guys,
we're gonna miss the migration.

27
00:05:47,387 --> 00:05:51,725
They left without me.
They do this every year.

28
00:05:53,768 --> 00:05:56,771
Why? Doesn't anyone love me?

29
00:05:57,105 --> 00:06:01,484
Isn't there anyone who cares
about Sid the Sloth?

30
00:06:04,153 --> 00:06:06,322
All right, I'll just go by myself.

31
00:06:08,908 --> 00:06:10,576
Sick.

32
00:06:10,659 --> 00:06:13,454
Wide body, kerb it next time.

33
00:06:13,495 --> 00:06:15,998
Oh, jeez. Yuck.

34
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:21,878
I can't believe it. Fresh wild greens.
Frank, where did you ever...?

35
00:06:21,962 --> 00:06:25,173
- Go ahead. Dig in.
- A dandelion.

36
00:06:25,257 --> 00:06:28,802
- I thought the frost wiped 'em all out.
- All but one.

37
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:34,057
It makes me so... I wanna... Yuck.

38
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:38,894
This has definitely not been my day.
You know what I'm sayin', buddy?

39
00:06:38,978 --> 00:06:42,773
What a mess. You rhinos
have tiny brains. Did you know that?

40
00:06:42,898 --> 00:06:47,861
It's just a fact. No offence. You probably
didn't even know what I'm talkin' about.

41
00:06:48,612 --> 00:06:49,988
Yummo.

42
00:06:50,197 --> 00:06:53,158
A dandelion. Must be
the last one of the season.

43
00:06:56,244 --> 00:06:58,621
- Carl.
- Easy, Frank.

44
00:06:58,705 --> 00:07:00,790
He ruined our salad.

45
00:07:02,166 --> 00:07:04,961
My mistake. That was my mistake. Let me...

46
00:07:05,503 --> 00:07:09,382
No, no, seriously, let me
take care of this. What is this?

47
00:07:09,423 --> 00:07:13,135
Pine cones. Oh, my goodness.
They're my favourite.

48
00:07:15,012 --> 00:07:19,474
Delicious. That's good eating.

49
00:07:19,725 --> 00:07:23,103
But don't let me hog them all up.
Here, you have some.

50
00:07:23,186 --> 00:07:26,022
<i>Tasty, isn't it? Bon appêtit.</i>

51
00:07:27,315 --> 00:07:29,484
Now?

52
00:07:29,943 --> 00:07:32,028
Now.

53
00:07:40,911 --> 00:07:44,957
- Just pretend that I'm not here.
- I wanted to hit him at full speed.

54
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:50,379
- That's OK. We'll have some fun with him.
- Don't let them impale me. I wanna live.

55
00:07:50,462 --> 00:07:53,757
- Get off me.
- Come on, you're makin' a scene.

56
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,635
<i>We'll just take our furry piñata and go.</i>

57
00:07:56,718 --> 00:07:59,721
If it's not them today,
it's someone else tomorrow.

58
00:07:59,804 --> 00:08:02,265
Well, I'd rather it not be today. OK?

59
00:08:02,307 --> 00:08:05,685
We'll break your neck
so you don't feel a thing.

60
00:08:05,768 --> 00:08:08,896
Wait a minute. I thought
rhinos were vegetarians.

61
00:08:09,063 --> 00:08:11,148
- An excellent point.
- Shut up.

62
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:14,902
Who says we're gonna eat him
after we kill him?

63
00:08:14,985 --> 00:08:17,905
I don't like animals that kill for pleasure.

64
00:08:17,988 --> 00:08:21,366
- Save it for a mammal that cares.
- I'm a mammal that cares.

65
00:08:21,658 --> 00:08:26,788
OK, if either of you make it across that
sinkhole in front of ya, you get the sloth.

66
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:30,750
That's right, you losers.
You take one step and you're dead.

67
00:08:34,921 --> 00:08:38,549
- You were bluffing, huh?
- Yeah. Yeah, that was a bluff.

68
00:08:39,675 --> 00:08:41,469
Get him.

69
00:09:17,503 --> 00:09:19,588
A dandelion?

70
00:09:22,424 --> 00:09:24,509
We did it.

71
00:09:32,975 --> 00:09:36,729
- You have beautiful eyes.
- Get off my face.

72
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:42,067
Whoa, we make a great team.
What do you say we head south together?

73
00:09:42,151 --> 00:09:44,611
Great. Jump on my back
and relax the whole way.

74
00:09:44,737 --> 00:09:46,780
- Wow, really?
- No.

75
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:51,326
Wait, aren't you going south?
The change of seasons, migration instincts.

76
00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:54,162
- Any of this a-ringin' a bell?
- I guess not. Bye.

77
00:09:54,246 --> 00:09:57,165
OK, then. Thanks for the help.
I can take it from here.

78
00:09:58,124 --> 00:10:01,919
You overgrown weasel.
Wait till we get down there.

79
00:10:02,712 --> 00:10:06,507
That south thing is way overrated.
The heat, the crowds - who needs it?

80
00:10:06,591 --> 00:10:11,137
Isn't this great? You and me,
two bachelors knockin' about in the wild.

81
00:10:11,262 --> 00:10:15,057
No, you just want a bodyguard
so you don't become somebody's side dish.

82
00:10:15,182 --> 00:10:17,518
You're a very shrewd mammal.

83
00:10:17,601 --> 00:10:20,520
OK, lead the way, Mr Big...
Didn't get the name.

84
00:10:20,604 --> 00:10:22,647
- Manfred.
- Manfred? Yuck.

85
00:10:22,731 --> 00:10:27,986
How about Manny the Moody Mammoth?
Or Manny the Melancholy... Manny the...

86
00:10:30,446 --> 00:10:32,532
Stop following me.

87
00:10:34,242 --> 00:10:40,081
OK, so you've got issues. You won't
even know I'm here. I'll just zip the lip.

88
00:11:24,122 --> 00:11:28,084
Look at the cute little baby, Diego.

89
00:11:30,461 --> 00:11:35,883
- Isn't it nice he'll be joining us for breakfast?
- It wouldn't be breakfast without him.

90
00:11:35,967 --> 00:11:41,764
Especially since his daddy wiped out half
our pack and wears our skin to keep warm.

91
00:11:41,847 --> 00:11:44,933
An eye for an eye, don't you think?

92
00:11:45,059 --> 00:11:48,645
Let's show him what happens
when he messes with sabres.

93
00:11:48,729 --> 00:11:51,857
Alert the troops. We attack at dawn.

94
00:11:52,941 --> 00:11:57,570
And, Diego, bring me that baby alive.

95
00:11:57,612 --> 00:12:02,950
If I'm gonna enjoy my revenge,
I want it to be fresh.

96
00:12:24,346 --> 00:12:26,514
Phew. I'm wiped out.

97
00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:30,518
- That's your shelter?
- You're a big guy. You got a lotta wood.

98
00:12:30,602 --> 00:12:33,396
- I'm a little guy.
- You got half a stick.

99
00:12:33,479 --> 00:12:39,819
But with my little stick and my highly
evolved brain, I shall create fire.

100
00:12:40,277 --> 00:12:42,071
Fascinating.

101
00:12:42,404 --> 00:12:46,492
We'll see if brains triumph
over brawn tonight. Now, won't we?

102
00:12:52,497 --> 00:12:54,708
Think I saw a spark.

103
00:12:58,628 --> 00:13:02,256
Any chance I could squeeze
in there with you, Manny, ol' pal?

104
00:13:02,298 --> 00:13:04,884
Isn't there someone else you can annoy?

105
00:13:04,967 --> 00:13:08,512
Friends? Family? Poisonous reptiles?

106
00:13:08,888 --> 00:13:13,600
My family abandoned me.
They just kinda migrated without me.

107
00:13:13,684 --> 00:13:16,311
You should see what they did last year.

108
00:13:16,395 --> 00:13:19,147
They woke up early and
tied my hands and feet

109
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:21,983
and they gagged me with a field mouse,

110
00:13:22,109 --> 00:13:25,737
covered their tracks, went
through water so I'd lose their scent,

111
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:28,656
and... who needs 'em, anyway?

112
00:13:33,202 --> 00:13:35,538
So what about you? You have family?

113
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:42,920
OK, you're tired. I see.
We'll talk more in the morning.

114
00:13:45,464 --> 00:13:49,009
Manfred? Manfred?
Could you scooch over a drop?

115
00:13:50,052 --> 00:13:53,180
Come on. Nobody falls asleep that fast.

116
00:13:53,263 --> 00:13:55,307
Manny.

117
00:16:46,176 --> 00:16:48,345
There's Diego. Fall back.

118
00:16:54,893 --> 00:16:57,771
- Where's the baby?
- I lost it over the falls.

119
00:16:57,979 --> 00:17:00,523
You lost it?

120
00:17:03,443 --> 00:17:05,987
- I want that baby, Diego.
- I'll get it.

121
00:17:06,070 --> 00:17:09,740
You'd better, unless you want to
serve as a replacement.

122
00:17:09,907 --> 00:17:13,243
We'll go up to Half Peak. Meet us there.

123
00:17:14,578 --> 00:17:16,663
It had better be alive.

124
00:17:17,998 --> 00:17:20,459
Can we trust you with that, Diego?

125
00:17:20,542 --> 00:17:23,086
Let's go.

126
00:17:45,816 --> 00:17:49,820
She picked a hair off my shoulder and says,
"If you have an extra mating dance,

127
00:17:49,903 --> 00:17:52,489
at least pick a female
with the same colour pelt. "

128
00:17:52,656 --> 00:17:56,076
I thought "Whoa. She's gonna go
praying mantis on me. "

129
00:17:56,201 --> 00:17:59,913
If you find a mate, you should be loyal.
In your case, grateful.

130
00:18:00,038 --> 00:18:03,291
- Now get away from me.
- I think mating for life is stupid.

131
00:18:03,374 --> 00:18:05,626
There's plenty of Sid to go around.

132
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:09,255
Manny?

133
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,966
Manny?

134
00:19:04,765 --> 00:19:07,268
Look at that. He's OK.

135
00:19:19,571 --> 00:19:22,240
She's gone.

136
00:19:32,041 --> 00:19:35,419
- Manny, are you forgetting something?
- No.

137
00:19:35,544 --> 00:19:39,590
- But you just saved him.
- I'm trying to get rid of the last thing I saved.

138
00:19:39,673 --> 00:19:42,217
But you can't leave him here.

139
00:19:46,221 --> 00:19:49,725
Look, there's smoke.
That's his herd right up the hill.

140
00:19:50,016 --> 00:19:53,979
- We should return him.
- Let's get this straight. There is no "we".

141
00:19:54,062 --> 00:19:59,692
There never was a "we". In fact,
without me, there wouldn't even be a "you".

142
00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:07,491
- Just up the hill.
- Listen very carefully: I'm not going.

143
00:20:07,742 --> 00:20:12,663
- Fine, be a jerk. I'll take care of him.
- Yeah, that's good.

144
00:20:12,705 --> 00:20:16,166
You can't even take care of yourself.
This, I gotta see.

145
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:20,545
I'll return you. We don't need
that meany-weeny mammoth, do we?

146
00:20:20,587 --> 00:20:22,714
No, we don't.

147
00:20:52,117 --> 00:20:55,578
You're an embarrassment to nature.
Do you know that?

148
00:20:56,162 --> 00:20:59,415
This is cake. I'm fine, I'm fine.

149
00:20:59,499 --> 00:21:01,584
I'm gonna die.

150
00:21:14,972 --> 00:21:16,473
Manny.

151
00:21:30,236 --> 00:21:34,157
- That pink thing is mine.
- No. Actually, that pink thing belongs to us.

152
00:21:37,243 --> 00:21:40,663
"Us"? You two are a bit of an odd couple.

153
00:21:40,746 --> 00:21:42,539
There is no "us".

154
00:21:42,623 --> 00:21:45,918
I see. Can't have one of your own,
so you want to adopt.

155
00:21:46,043 --> 00:21:49,129
Look, I'm sorry to interrupt
your snack, but we gotta go.

156
00:21:49,338 --> 00:21:52,799
The baby? Please.
I was returning him to his herd.

157
00:21:52,924 --> 00:21:54,968
Oh, yeah. Nice try, bucktooth.

158
00:21:55,093 --> 00:21:57,178
- Callin' me a liar?
- I didn't say that.

159
00:21:57,262 --> 00:21:59,347
You were thinkin' it.

160
00:21:59,430 --> 00:22:02,100
I don't like this cat. He reads minds.

161
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:06,270
- Name's Diego, friend.
- Manfred, and I'm not your friend.

162
00:22:06,479 --> 00:22:13,569
Fine, Manfred. If you're lookin' for the
humans, you're wastin' your time. They left.

163
00:22:13,694 --> 00:22:16,863
Thanks for the advice. Now beat it.

164
00:22:16,947 --> 00:22:20,992
I'll help you bring it to its herd,
but leave me alone after that.

165
00:22:21,076 --> 00:22:24,663
- OK. OK, deal. What's your problem?
- You are my problem.

166
00:22:24,746 --> 00:22:29,042
I think you're stressed, so you eat too much.
It's hard to get fat on a vegan diet.

167
00:22:29,167 --> 00:22:33,296
I'm not fat. It's all this fur.
It makes me look poofy.

168
00:22:33,379 --> 00:22:37,299
All right, you have fat hair.
But when you're ready to talk, I'm here.

169
00:22:40,427 --> 00:22:43,764
What are you doin'? Just drop it on the ledge.

170
00:22:43,889 --> 00:22:47,059
- We should make sure they found him.
- Good idea.

171
00:22:47,142 --> 00:22:49,603
No, no. Wait, wait, wait, wait.

172
00:22:49,728 --> 00:22:51,855
Don't spear me.

173
00:22:55,233 --> 00:22:58,027
- This is a problem.
- Now what?

174
00:22:59,070 --> 00:23:01,614
That's perfect.

175
00:23:31,768 --> 00:23:34,312
- I told you they were gone.
- Look who it is.

176
00:23:34,395 --> 00:23:37,106
Don't you have some
poor animal to disembowel?

177
00:23:37,189 --> 00:23:41,026
They couldn't be far. I mean,
they went this way, or this way?

178
00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:43,445
You don't know much
about tracking, do you?

179
00:23:43,612 --> 00:23:47,407
I'm a sloth. I see a tree,
eat a leaf. That's my tracking.

180
00:23:47,532 --> 00:23:49,785
You didn't miss them by much.

181
00:23:49,868 --> 00:23:53,246
It's still green.
They headed north two hours ago.

182
00:23:53,663 --> 00:23:57,834
It's still green.
They headed north two hours ago.

183
00:24:00,169 --> 00:24:02,839
You don't need this aggravation.

184
00:24:03,798 --> 00:24:07,635
Give me the baby. I can
track humans down a lot faster than you.

185
00:24:07,718 --> 00:24:10,429
And you're just a good citizen helpin' out?

186
00:24:10,512 --> 00:24:14,016
- I just know where the humans are going.
- Glacier Pass.

187
00:24:14,141 --> 00:24:17,728
Everybody knows they have
a settlement on the other side.

188
00:24:18,687 --> 00:24:23,650
Unless you know how to track, you'll never
reach them before snow closes the pass.

189
00:24:26,371 --> 00:24:29,416
Which should be, like, tomorrow.

190
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:35,339
So, you can give that baby to me,
or go get lost in a blizzard. It's your choice.

191
00:24:42,044 --> 00:24:46,339
Here's your little bundle of joy.
We're returning it to the humans.

192
00:24:46,429 --> 00:24:51,976
The big, bad tigey-wigey gets left behind.
Poor tigey-wigey.

193
00:24:52,065 --> 00:24:54,901
Sid, tigey-wigey is gonna lead the way.

194
00:24:58,454 --> 00:25:01,123
Manny, can I talk to you for a second?

195
00:25:01,210 --> 00:25:06,048
No. The sooner we find the humans,
the sooner I get rid of Mr Stinky Drool-Face,

196
00:25:06,137 --> 00:25:08,640
and the baby, too.

197
00:25:09,729 --> 00:25:12,398
You won't always have
Jumbo around to protect you.

198
00:25:12,485 --> 00:25:18,116
And when that day comes, I suggest you
watch your back, cos I'll be chewin' on it.

199
00:25:18,247 --> 00:25:22,000
Über-tracker. Up front, where I can see you.

200
00:25:22,131 --> 00:25:23,674
Help me.

201
00:25:39,418 --> 00:25:43,130
You gotta make it stop.
I can't take it any more.

202
00:25:43,301 --> 00:25:47,429
- I've eaten things that complained less.
- He won't stop squirming.

203
00:25:47,561 --> 00:25:49,688
- Watch its head.
- Put it down.

204
00:25:49,732 --> 00:25:52,318
Jeez, "pick him up, put him down... "

205
00:25:52,655 --> 00:25:55,866
- Its nose is dry.
- That means something's wrong with it.

206
00:25:55,954 --> 00:25:58,957
- Someone should lick it. Just in case.
- I'll do it.

207
00:25:59,044 --> 00:26:01,504
- He's wearing one of those baby thingies.
- So?

208
00:26:01,591 --> 00:26:04,427
So if he poops, where does it go?

209
00:26:06,768 --> 00:26:10,772
- Humans are disgusting.
- OK, you. Check for poop.

210
00:26:10,862 --> 00:26:14,156
- Why am I the poop-checker?
- Returning him was your idea,

211
00:26:14,243 --> 00:26:17,663
you're small and insignificant,
and I'll pummel you if you don't.

212
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:20,252
- Why else?
- Now, Sid.

213
00:26:26,937 --> 00:26:30,065
I mean, my goodness.
Look out. Coming through.

214
00:26:30,153 --> 00:26:33,030
- Watch out.
- Stop wavin' that thing around.

215
00:26:33,118 --> 00:26:35,870
I'm gonna slip.

216
00:26:39,296 --> 00:26:41,632
It's clean. Got ya!

217
00:26:43,807 --> 00:26:45,892
Will you cut it out?

218
00:26:47,732 --> 00:26:50,610
Do that again. He likes it.

219
00:26:52,701 --> 00:26:55,871
It's makin' me feel better too.

220
00:26:55,958 --> 00:26:58,127
Here, you hold it.

221
00:27:04,686 --> 00:27:06,437
Turn him towards me.

222
00:27:06,690 --> 00:27:08,942
Where is the baby?

223
00:27:09,988 --> 00:27:12,199
There he is.

224
00:27:12,285 --> 00:27:15,121
Where is the baby?

225
00:27:15,626 --> 00:27:18,837
There he is.

226
00:27:19,008 --> 00:27:21,468
Stop it. You're scarin' him.

227
00:27:25,647 --> 00:27:28,066
- I bet he's hungry.
- How about some milk?

228
00:27:28,152 --> 00:27:31,197
- I'd love some.
- Not you. The baby.

229
00:27:31,283 --> 00:27:33,911
I ain't exactly lactating right now, pal.

230
00:27:33,999 --> 00:27:36,752
- You're a little low on the food chain to...
- Enough.

231
00:27:36,838 --> 00:27:40,383
Enough, enough, enough.

232
00:27:42,893 --> 00:27:44,978
Food.

233
00:27:53,206 --> 00:27:54,874
I don't know, but I've been told

234
00:27:55,002 --> 00:27:57,129
I don't know, but I've been told

235
00:27:57,215 --> 00:28:01,344
End of the world be mighty cold

236
00:28:01,809 --> 00:28:04,269
Prepare for the Ice age!

237
00:28:04,356 --> 00:28:06,858
Protect the dodo way of life!

238
00:28:06,986 --> 00:28:11,240
Survival separates the dodos from the beasts!

239
00:28:12,330 --> 00:28:14,958
Protect the dodo way of life!

240
00:28:15,045 --> 00:28:17,297
Prepare for the Ice age!

241
00:28:17,384 --> 00:28:20,387
- Ice age?
- I've heard of these crackpots.

242
00:28:23,313 --> 00:28:25,857
- Intruders.
- Now, don't fall in.

243
00:28:25,944 --> 00:28:29,989
- If you do, you will definitely...
- Intruders. Intruder...

244
00:28:31,748 --> 00:28:33,666
<i>.. burn and die.</i>

245
00:28:34,796 --> 00:28:37,966
Can we have our melon back?
Junior's hungry and...

246
00:28:38,095 --> 00:28:41,390
No way. This is our private
stockpile for the Ice age.

247
00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:45,606
Sub arctic temperatures will force us
underground for a billion years.

248
00:28:45,695 --> 00:28:47,780
So you got three melons?

249
00:28:49,327 --> 00:28:53,331
If you weren't smart enough
to plan ahead, then doom on you.

250
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:57,174
Doom on you. Doom on you. Doom on you.

251
00:28:57,220 --> 00:29:00,056
- Get away from me.
- Doom on you.

252
00:29:00,143 --> 00:29:02,395
Oh, no. No.

253
00:29:02,815 --> 00:29:06,402
Retrieve the melon.
Tae kwon dodos, attack.

254
00:29:18,056 --> 00:29:21,726
- The melon.
- The melon, the melon, the melon...

255
00:29:23,485 --> 00:29:25,778
There goes our last female.

256
00:29:33,339 --> 00:29:36,842
- Got it, got it, got it.
- Don't got it.

257
00:29:37,848 --> 00:29:40,351
The last melon.

258
00:31:07,167 --> 00:31:10,253
Sid. Now we gotta find more food.

259
00:31:13,597 --> 00:31:17,559
Right, more to the right. Right, right, right.

260
00:31:17,648 --> 00:31:21,360
- Look at that. Dinner and a show.
- Left, left, left.

261
00:31:27,294 --> 00:31:31,298
Now to find a meal
befitting a conquering hero.

262
00:31:33,891 --> 00:31:37,227
What ho? A foe? Come on,
come on. You want a piece of me?

263
00:31:40,906 --> 00:31:42,991
Spoils worthy of such a noble...

264
00:31:52,139 --> 00:31:54,183
Bedtime, squirt.

265
00:32:03,914 --> 00:32:05,791
The triumphant return.

266
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:08,755
Huh? Oh, that.

267
00:32:09,885 --> 00:32:14,264
I'm so full. How about a good-night
kiss for your big buddy, Sid?

268
00:32:15,021 --> 00:32:18,107
- He's asleep.
- I was talking to you.

269
00:32:18,988 --> 00:32:21,115
Fine, I'll tuck myself in.

270
00:32:27,464 --> 00:32:30,592
All right, good night.

271
00:32:53,146 --> 00:32:55,314
Will you stop it?

272
00:32:55,651 --> 00:32:58,445
All right, all right. I was trying to relax.

273
00:33:04,127 --> 00:33:06,213
Oy.

274
00:33:54,444 --> 00:33:57,781
- What the...?
- Slice me. It'll be the last thing you ever do.

275
00:33:57,868 --> 00:34:01,455
- I'm workin' here, you waste of fur.
- Frustrated, Diego?

276
00:34:01,585 --> 00:34:04,629
Tracking down helpless infants
too difficult for you?

277
00:34:04,716 --> 00:34:08,803
- What are you two doin' here?
- Soto's getting tired of waiting.

278
00:34:08,892 --> 00:34:14,189
Yeah, he said "Come back with the baby,
or don't come back at all. "

279
00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:18,076
I have a message for Soto.

280
00:34:18,162 --> 00:34:20,665
Tell him I'm bringing the baby.

281
00:34:21,878 --> 00:34:24,088
And tell him I'm bringing...

282
00:34:24,718 --> 00:34:26,803
a mammoth.

283
00:34:26,889 --> 00:34:29,558
- A mammoth?
- Mammoths never travel alone.

284
00:34:30,187 --> 00:34:33,774
This one does,
and I'm leading him to Half Peak.

285
00:34:35,324 --> 00:34:37,576
Look at all that meat. Let's get him.

286
00:34:37,662 --> 00:34:41,916
Not yet. We'll need the whole pack
to bring this mammoth down.

287
00:34:42,005 --> 00:34:44,091
Get everyone ready.

288
00:34:44,761 --> 00:34:46,846
Now.

289
00:35:10,066 --> 00:35:13,194
- Where's the baby?
- You lost it?

290
00:35:14,785 --> 00:35:15,994
Sid.

291
00:35:16,872 --> 00:35:20,584
It's so ugly. Positively adorable.

292
00:35:20,672 --> 00:35:24,551
Hello, pumpkin. Hello, little baldy bean.

293
00:35:24,848 --> 00:35:28,685
- Where'd you find it?
- The poor kid, all alone in the wild.

294
00:35:28,814 --> 00:35:31,024
Sabres were closing in on him.

295
00:35:31,111 --> 00:35:34,113
- So I just snatched him.
- So brave.

296
00:35:34,202 --> 00:35:38,998
Yeah, well, he needed me,
and I only wish I had one of my own, too.

297
00:35:39,087 --> 00:35:43,258
Really? I find that attractive in a male.

298
00:35:43,387 --> 00:35:46,974
Alas. Who wouldn't want
a family, I always say.

299
00:35:47,563 --> 00:35:51,275
- Where've you been hiding?
- Yeah, well, you know...

300
00:35:54,745 --> 00:35:58,540
Cute kid, huh? So, as I was saying, ladies...

301
00:36:00,716 --> 00:36:03,302
Hey. Hi, Manny.

302
00:36:03,848 --> 00:36:06,267
What's the matter with you?

303
00:36:06,563 --> 00:36:10,984
Excuse me, ladies. You just keep
marinating and I'll be right back.

304
00:36:13,369 --> 00:36:15,454
Sexy.

305
00:36:16,041 --> 00:36:19,253
He's not much to look at,
but it's so hard to find a family guy.

306
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:22,802
Tell me about it.
All the sensitive ones get eaten.

307
00:36:23,391 --> 00:36:26,977
No, no, no. Manny, please,
I'm begging you. I need him.

308
00:36:27,065 --> 00:36:30,651
- A good-lookin' guy like you?
- You say that, but you don't mean it.

309
00:36:30,740 --> 00:36:35,244
No, seriously. Look at you.
Those ladies, they don't stand a chance.

310
00:36:35,375 --> 00:36:38,837
- You have a cruel sense of humour.
- Don't let me cramp your style.

311
00:36:38,924 --> 00:36:41,969
- Thanks, Manny. You're a pal.
- Without Pinky.

312
00:36:42,055 --> 00:36:44,391
Manny, I need him.

313
00:36:47,985 --> 00:36:51,030
So, ladies, where were we?

314
00:36:51,326 --> 00:36:54,037
- Carl.
- Easy, Frank.

315
00:36:56,712 --> 00:37:01,091
Pretty tail walks by, suddenly he moves
like a cheetah. And that tiger...

316
00:37:01,139 --> 00:37:05,018
Yeah, Mr Great Tracker.
Can't even find a sloth.

317
00:37:05,064 --> 00:37:08,943
What am I? The wet nurse?
What are you lookin' at, bone bag?

318
00:37:11,202 --> 00:37:14,914
Look at you. You're gonna
grow into a great predator.

319
00:37:15,336 --> 00:37:19,715
I don't think so. What have you got?
You got a little patch of fur.

320
00:37:19,804 --> 00:37:22,349
No fangs, no claws.

321
00:37:22,477 --> 00:37:25,813
You're folds of skin wrapped in mush.

322
00:37:26,192 --> 00:37:28,903
What's so threatening about you?

323
00:37:34,168 --> 00:37:37,046
Does this look like
a petting zoo to you? Huh?

324
00:37:39,931 --> 00:37:43,559
OK. All right, wise guy.
You just earned a time-out.

325
00:37:46,528 --> 00:37:49,489
You think that's funny? How about this?

326
00:37:51,622 --> 00:37:54,417
You'll be a little snack for the owls.

327
00:37:56,132 --> 00:37:59,301
You're a brave little squirt, I'll give you that.

328
00:38:05,401 --> 00:38:10,031
Thank goodness. Thank goodness.
No. A tiger.

329
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:12,706
Help. Help.

330
00:38:12,792 --> 00:38:14,961
- Where's the baby?
- Manfred has him.

331
00:38:15,048 --> 00:38:19,302
Just put me in your mouth.
Come on. Hurry up. He got me.

332
00:38:20,267 --> 00:38:21,268
Help.

333
00:38:21,395 --> 00:38:23,939
- Get away from me.
- It went this way.

334
00:38:24,735 --> 00:38:27,029
Over here.

335
00:38:34,715 --> 00:38:37,259
Carl. The tiger beat us to him.

336
00:38:38,724 --> 00:38:41,310
Wait a minute.

337
00:38:46,282 --> 00:38:48,784
He's dead all right.

338
00:38:48,913 --> 00:38:51,040
Carnivores have all the fun.

339
00:38:53,589 --> 00:38:58,302
Gosh, I hate breaking their hearts
like that. But you know how it is.

340
00:38:59,101 --> 00:39:01,812
All right, thanks. You can put me down now.

341
00:39:02,442 --> 00:39:04,611
Manny. Manny.

342
00:39:04,947 --> 00:39:08,868
Guys, I thought we were in a hurry.
And Diego, spit that out.

343
00:39:08,956 --> 00:39:12,042
You don't know where it's been.

344
00:39:12,171 --> 00:39:15,883
Boy. For a second there,
I thought you were gonna eat me.

345
00:39:15,971 --> 00:39:19,099
- I don't eat junk food.
- Thought you were gonna...

346
00:39:19,228 --> 00:39:21,605
I thought you were gonna... Were you?

347
00:39:24,406 --> 00:39:29,369
Come on, wait up. Wait up. Come on,
come on. Can you wait a second, please?

348
00:39:29,459 --> 00:39:31,544
Fellas.

349
00:39:32,841 --> 00:39:34,926
Thanks for waiting.

350
00:39:35,013 --> 00:39:37,682
Three, two, one...

351
00:39:40,649 --> 00:39:42,734
Sure is faithful.

352
00:39:57,603 --> 00:39:59,730
- Don't make me reach back.
- He started it.

353
00:39:59,816 --> 00:40:03,069
I don't care who started it. I'll finish it.

354
00:40:35,936 --> 00:40:38,813
Modern architecture. It'll never last.

355
00:40:53,306 --> 00:40:55,350
Hiya, Manny.

356
00:40:57,273 --> 00:40:59,525
Hi, Diego.

357
00:41:06,417 --> 00:41:08,461
Hey, Sid.

358
00:41:08,881 --> 00:41:12,593
- You're lost.
- No. I know exactly where we are.

359
00:41:12,723 --> 00:41:15,058
Ask him directions.

360
00:41:15,145 --> 00:41:17,814
- I don't need directions.
- Fine, I'll ask him.

361
00:41:17,901 --> 00:41:21,029
Buddy. You see any humans go by here?

362
00:41:24,164 --> 00:41:27,125
I love this game. I love this game. OK, OK.

363
00:41:27,213 --> 00:41:31,717
Three words. First word.
Stomp. No, no. Stamp, stamp.

364
00:41:31,806 --> 00:41:33,975
Let me try. Pack.

365
00:41:34,102 --> 00:41:38,315
Good one, Manny.
Pack of long teeth and claws.

366
00:41:39,865 --> 00:41:41,867
Pack of wolves? Pack of...

367
00:41:41,953 --> 00:41:44,706
Pack of bears? Pack of fleas?

368
00:41:44,750 --> 00:41:46,836
Pack of whiskers? Pack of noses?

369
00:41:47,256 --> 00:41:49,550
- Pachyderm?
- Pack of lies.

370
00:41:49,636 --> 00:41:52,597
Pack of troubles. Pack a wallop.
Pack of birds.

371
00:41:52,851 --> 00:41:54,895
Pack of flying fish.

372
00:42:44,379 --> 00:42:46,631
Great news. I found a short cut.

373
00:42:49,556 --> 00:42:53,643
- What do you mean, short cut?
- I mean faster than the long way around.

374
00:42:53,941 --> 00:42:55,901
I know what a short cut is.

375
00:42:55,079 --> 00:43:00,376
Either we beat the humans to Glacier Pass
or we take the long way and miss 'em.

376
00:43:00,586 --> 00:43:04,214
Through there? What do you take me for?

377
00:43:04,300 --> 00:43:07,762
This time tomorrow,
you could be a free mammoth.

378
00:43:08,180 --> 00:43:10,849
Or a nanny. I never get tired of peek-a-boo.

379
00:43:10,933 --> 00:43:13,853
Guys. Guys. Check this out.

380
00:43:16,190 --> 00:43:18,734
Sid, the tiger found a short cut.

381
00:43:20,863 --> 00:43:22,949
No, thanks. I choose life.

382
00:43:23,033 --> 00:43:25,660
Then I suggest you take the short cut.

383
00:43:25,787 --> 00:43:29,623
- Are you threatening me?
- Move, sloth!

384
00:43:34,632 --> 00:43:37,093
Way to go, tiger.

385
00:43:37,177 --> 00:43:39,638
Quick. Get inside.

386
00:44:02,378 --> 00:44:05,047
OK, I vote short cut.

387
00:44:19,651 --> 00:44:23,321
Guys, stick together.
It's easy to get lost in here.

388
00:44:38,927 --> 00:44:41,013
Guys?

389
00:44:58,329 --> 00:45:00,372
A fish.

390
00:45:42,722 --> 00:45:46,851
Will you keep up, please?
Hard enough to keep track of one baby.

391
00:46:32,164 --> 00:46:34,208
I gotcha.

392
00:46:50,897 --> 00:46:53,358
Captain, iceberg ahead.

393
00:46:59,785 --> 00:47:01,870
Oh, no.

394
00:47:53,191 --> 00:47:55,526
Yeah. Who's up for round two?

395
00:47:59,949 --> 00:48:02,034
Tell the kid to be more careful.

396
00:48:43,383 --> 00:48:46,219
Look, look. Tigers.

397
00:48:48,306 --> 00:48:53,019
No, it's OK, it's OK. Look, the tigers
are just playing tag with the antelope.

398
00:48:55,107 --> 00:48:59,570
- With their teeth.
- Come on, Sid, let's play tag.

399
00:48:59,655 --> 00:49:01,741
You're it.

400
00:49:02,951 --> 00:49:06,162
Sure. OK, OK, OK, where are the sloths?

401
00:49:06,247 --> 00:49:09,125
You never see any sloths.
Have you ever noticed?

402
00:49:09,168 --> 00:49:12,797
- Look, Manny, a mammoth.
- Somebody pinch me.

403
00:49:12,881 --> 00:49:16,051
Hey, hey, this fat one looks just like you.

404
00:49:16,970 --> 00:49:19,264
And he's got a family.

405
00:49:19,349 --> 00:49:22,768
And he's happy.
Look, he's playing with his kid.

406
00:49:22,853 --> 00:49:26,523
See? That's your problem.
That's what mammoths are supposed to do.

407
00:49:26,650 --> 00:49:29,403
- Sid...
- Find a she-mammoth, have baby mammoths...

408
00:49:29,487 --> 00:49:30,905
- Sid.
- What?

409
00:49:30,990 --> 00:49:33,075
- Shut up.
- But...

410
00:53:00,939 --> 00:53:03,233
Would you look at that.

411
00:53:03,318 --> 00:53:06,362
The tiger actually did it. There's Half Peak.

412
00:53:06,448 --> 00:53:09,159
Next stop, Glacier Pass.

413
00:53:09,535 --> 00:53:13,330
- How could I ever have doubted you?
- Did you hear that, little fella?

414
00:53:13,373 --> 00:53:15,458
You're almost home.

415
00:53:20,216 --> 00:53:22,760
- My feet are sweating.
- Do we need a newsflash

416
00:53:22,844 --> 00:53:26,181
- every time your body does something?
- Ignore him.

417
00:53:26,308 --> 00:53:29,519
Seriously. My feet are really hot.

418
00:53:35,236 --> 00:53:37,571
Tell me that was your stomach.

419
00:53:37,656 --> 00:53:39,866
I'm sure it was just thunder.

420
00:53:40,159 --> 00:53:43,079
From underground?

421
00:54:03,399 --> 00:54:05,485
Come on, keep up with me.

422
00:54:05,611 --> 00:54:08,363
I would if you were moving.

423
00:54:10,784 --> 00:54:13,954
- I wish I could jump like that.
- Wish granted.

424
00:54:18,336 --> 00:54:22,715
- Come on, move faster.
- Have you noticed the river of lava?

425
00:54:41,952 --> 00:54:44,037
Hold Pinky.

426
00:55:15,496 --> 00:55:17,665
Manny.

427
00:55:29,099 --> 00:55:33,811
Manny, Manny, Manny, you OK?
Come on, come on, say something. Anything.

428
00:55:36,192 --> 00:55:38,277
What? What? I can't hear you.

429
00:55:39,086 --> 00:55:41,297
You're standing on my trunk.

430
00:55:43,304 --> 00:55:46,765
- You're OK. You're OK.
- Why did you do that?

431
00:55:46,896 --> 00:55:49,607
You could have died, trying to save me.

432
00:55:50,028 --> 00:55:52,614
That's what you do in a herd.

433
00:55:52,742 --> 00:55:54,869
You look out for each other.

434
00:55:55,039 --> 00:55:57,333
Well, thanks.

435
00:55:59,509 --> 00:56:04,096
I don't know about you guys,
but we are the weirdest herd I've ever seen.

436
00:56:22,478 --> 00:56:25,523
I can't wait to get
my claws in that mammoth.

437
00:56:25,611 --> 00:56:29,406
No one touches the mammoth
until I get that baby.

438
00:56:32,794 --> 00:56:35,464
First, I'll slice its hind quarters into sections.

439
00:56:35,551 --> 00:56:39,805
- I'll put the white meat in one pile and...
- Knock it off. I'm starving.

440
00:56:39,894 --> 00:56:43,565
Next, the shoulders. Occasionally
tough, but extremely juicy.

441
00:56:43,695 --> 00:56:46,864
- I told you to knock it off.
- Save your energy.

442
00:56:46,952 --> 00:56:49,955
Mammoths don't go down easy.

443
00:56:50,210 --> 00:56:52,545
There's only one way to do it.

444
00:56:52,715 --> 00:56:55,218
First, you have to force it into a corner.

445
00:56:56,056 --> 00:56:59,893
Cut off its retreat.
And when you three have it trapped,

446
00:57:00,149 --> 00:57:02,276
I'll go for the throat.

447
00:57:12,302 --> 00:57:15,055
Guys, we gotta get this kid outta the wind.

448
00:57:19,319 --> 00:57:21,613
- How much further?
- Three miles.

449
00:57:21,699 --> 00:57:25,119
I'm beat. We'll get there in the morning.

450
00:57:28,214 --> 00:57:31,926
- What are you doin'?
- I'm putting sloths on the map.

451
00:57:34,813 --> 00:57:37,941
Why don't you make it realistic
and draw him lying down?

452
00:57:38,028 --> 00:57:40,114
And make him rounder.

453
00:57:42,706 --> 00:57:46,460
- Perfect.
- I forgot how to laugh.

454
00:57:53,857 --> 00:57:55,942
I'm a genius.

455
00:57:59,620 --> 00:58:04,583
From now on you'll have to
refer to me as Sid, Lord of the Flame.

456
00:58:04,058 --> 00:58:07,519
Lord of the Flame, your tail's on fire.

457
00:58:15,490 --> 00:58:19,494
Thank you. From now on,
I'm gonna call you Diego.

458
00:58:19,580 --> 00:58:21,915
Lord of Touch Me and You're Dead.

459
00:58:22,041 --> 00:58:25,169
I'm just kiddin', you little knucklehead.

460
00:58:25,671 --> 00:58:27,923
Lovebirds.

461
00:58:28,007 --> 00:58:30,092
Look at this.

462
00:58:34,015 --> 00:58:36,058
I don't believe it.

463
00:58:49,536 --> 00:58:54,541
Come here, you little biped.
Come here, you little wormy-worm.

464
00:58:54,627 --> 00:58:56,795
Come to Uncle Sid.

465
00:58:56,880 --> 00:58:59,924
No, no, no, no, no, no. This way. This way.

466
00:59:01,051 --> 00:59:03,721
No, no, no. No, go to him.

467
00:59:04,849 --> 00:59:06,934
Go to him.

468
00:59:09,355 --> 00:59:10,606
OK.

469
00:59:12,025 --> 00:59:15,737
Good job. Keep practisin'.

470
00:59:18,701 --> 00:59:21,871
Look at that. Our little guy is growing up.

471
00:59:24,125 --> 00:59:27,169
All right, come on. Sleep time, lumpy.

472
00:59:32,844 --> 00:59:34,930
Look at that big pushover.

473
00:59:36,516 --> 00:59:40,812
You know, Diego, I've never had
a friend who would risk his life for me.

474
00:59:41,273 --> 00:59:45,610
Yeah, Manny's... he's a good guy.

475
00:59:45,988 --> 00:59:48,073
Yeah, he is.

476
00:59:48,783 --> 00:59:51,202
Well, good night.

477
01:00:23,330 --> 01:00:28,877
Let's get you all cleaned up. What's your
daddy gonna say if you go back all stinky?

478
01:00:29,755 --> 01:00:33,801
Let me just clean that up.
That looks good. A little bit here.

479
01:00:33,885 --> 01:00:37,722
- You clean up nice, little fella.
- I think he's starting to look like me.

480
01:00:37,808 --> 01:00:39,893
Diego, what do you think?

481
01:00:41,545 --> 01:00:43,964
- Maybe we shouldn't do this.
- Why not?

482
01:00:44,036 --> 01:00:47,790
If we save him, he'll be a hunter.
And who do you think he'll hunt?

483
01:00:48,021 --> 01:00:50,398
Maybe because we save him,
he won't hunt us.

484
01:00:50,471 --> 01:00:55,100
Yeah, and maybe he'll grow fur and
a long skinny neck and call you Mama.

485
01:00:55,618 --> 01:01:00,998
- What's your problem?
- Nothing. Let's go. I'm freezing my tail off.

486
01:01:20,196 --> 01:01:22,365
Diego. You frozen back there?

487
01:01:26,548 --> 01:01:28,550
- Get down.
- What?

488
01:01:28,666 --> 01:01:30,960
- Get down and follow me.
- What's goin' on?

489
01:01:31,033 --> 01:01:36,079
At the bottom of Half Peak,
there's an ambush waiting for you.

490
01:01:36,139 --> 01:01:38,392
- What?
- What do you mean, "ambush"?

491
01:01:40,623 --> 01:01:42,791
- You set us up.
- It was my job.

492
01:01:42,865 --> 01:01:46,451
- I was to get the baby, but then...
- You brought us home for dinner.

493
01:01:46,518 --> 01:01:49,312
- That's it. You're out of the herd.
- I'm sorry.

494
01:01:49,383 --> 01:01:51,468
No, you're not. Not yet.

495
01:01:51,666 --> 01:01:55,337
- Listen, I can help you.
- Stay close, Sid. We can fight our way out.

496
01:01:55,486 --> 01:01:58,656
You can't. The pack's too strong.
You have to trust me.

497
01:01:58,683 --> 01:02:02,019
Trust you? Why in the world
would we trust you?

498
01:02:02,088 --> 01:02:04,173
Because I'm your only chance.

499
01:02:17,739 --> 01:02:19,782
Hello, ladies.

500
01:02:20,644 --> 01:02:26,066
- Look who decided to show up.
- Diego, I was beginning to worry about you.

501
01:02:26,166 --> 01:02:32,422
No need to worry. In about two minutes
you'll be satisfying your taste for revenge.

502
01:02:32,518 --> 01:02:34,228
Very nice.

503
01:02:34,594 --> 01:02:37,681
I see the sloth. And he's got the baby.

504
01:02:37,708 --> 01:02:43,130
Don't give away your positions until you
see the mammoth. He's the one to surprise.

505
01:02:44,310 --> 01:02:46,770
You want to maul something, don't you?

506
01:02:46,883 --> 01:02:50,387
- I wanna maul.
- Then what are you waiting for?

507
01:02:53,237 --> 01:02:56,031
No, I said wait for the mammoth.

508
01:03:17,939 --> 01:03:21,108
Backscratcher. Eat my powder!

509
01:03:36,620 --> 01:03:38,706
Loop-de-loop.

510
01:03:39,694 --> 01:03:41,862
Slalom! Slalom, baby!

511
01:04:07,468 --> 01:04:11,263
Sorry, fellas. He got a little frostbite.

512
01:04:12,865 --> 01:04:14,950
Get him.

513
01:04:17,930 --> 01:04:20,015
Surprise!

514
01:04:24,904 --> 01:04:29,576
OK, follow me. We'll pick up Sid
and get outta here while we can.

515
01:04:29,637 --> 01:04:33,599
Come on, Diego,
let's bring this mammoth down.

516
01:04:45,871 --> 01:04:48,207
There he is.

517
01:04:50,230 --> 01:04:52,691
That's right. Where's the baby?

518
01:04:56,540 --> 01:04:59,835
Survival of the fittest.

519
01:04:59,904 --> 01:05:02,740
I don't think so. Yeah.

520
01:05:15,308 --> 01:05:19,812
- What are you doing?
- Leave the mammoth alone.

521
01:05:22,734 --> 01:05:25,779
Fine. I'll take you down first.

522
01:06:41,759 --> 01:06:43,844
We did it.

523
01:06:56,570 --> 01:06:59,239
We were some team, huh?

524
01:07:00,033 --> 01:07:03,411
Were? Come on, we're still a team.

525
01:07:03,913 --> 01:07:06,458
I'm sorry I set you up.

526
01:07:07,001 --> 01:07:09,837
You know me -
I'm too lazy to hold a grudge.

527
01:07:13,133 --> 01:07:15,219
Knock it off, squirt.

528
01:07:16,180 --> 01:07:18,224
You gotta be strong.

529
01:07:18,600 --> 01:07:21,895
You have to take care of Manfred and Sid.

530
01:07:22,897 --> 01:07:24,940
Especially Sid.

531
01:07:25,025 --> 01:07:28,903
Come on, you can lick this. You're a tiger.

532
01:07:28,989 --> 01:07:32,117
Look, I'll carry you.
Come on, what do you say?

533
01:07:32,243 --> 01:07:34,495
Come on, Diego, come on.

534
01:07:34,579 --> 01:07:36,748
Tell him he's going to be OK, Manny.

535
01:07:38,335 --> 01:07:41,963
Listen, you have to leave me here.

536
01:07:42,089 --> 01:07:46,260
If those humans get through the pass,
you'll never catch them.

537
01:07:46,929 --> 01:07:50,016
You didn't have to do that.

538
01:07:50,101 --> 01:07:52,854
That's what you do in a herd.

539
01:11:08,703 --> 01:11:10,788
Don't forget about us.

540
01:11:10,873 --> 01:11:12,958
OK?

541
01:11:15,169 --> 01:11:17,922
We won't forget about you.

542
01:11:57,561 --> 01:12:00,188
Goodbye.

543
01:12:00,273 --> 01:12:02,733
Goodbye. Goodbye.

544
01:12:02,818 --> 01:12:05,153
- Sid...
- Bye.

545
01:12:06,572 --> 01:12:08,657
Bye.

546
01:12:11,412 --> 01:12:13,831
That's right. Where's the baby?

547
01:12:13,957 --> 01:12:16,501
Come on, Sid, let's head south.

548
01:12:34,485 --> 01:12:36,487
Bye.

549
01:12:37,573 --> 01:12:41,118
Save your breath, Sid.
You know humans can't talk.

550
01:12:41,620 --> 01:12:43,664
Diego? You're OK.

551
01:12:43,832 --> 01:12:47,043
- Nine lives, baby.
- You're OK.

552
01:12:47,127 --> 01:12:49,213
You're OK.

553
01:12:49,881 --> 01:12:51,966
I could kiss ya.

554
01:12:53,678 --> 01:12:55,889
Welcome back, partner. Wanna lift?

555
01:12:55,972 --> 01:12:58,975
No thanks. I gotta save
whatever dignity I've got left.

556
01:12:59,144 --> 01:13:03,606
You're hanging out with us. Dignity's
got nothing to do with it. I'll take that lift.

557
01:13:03,692 --> 01:13:06,236
- Yeah, climb aboard.
- Pick me up, buddy.

558
01:13:06,779 --> 01:13:10,282
Mush. Or not mush. Either way.

559
01:13:14,039 --> 01:13:16,666
This is gonna be the best migration ever.

560
01:13:16,751 --> 01:13:21,672
I'll show you my favourite watering holes.
I turn brown when the fungus in my fur dries.

561
01:13:21,757 --> 01:13:25,553
- Attractive.
- This whole Ice age thing is getting old.

562
01:13:25,638 --> 01:13:28,975
You know what I could go for?
Global warming.

563
01:13:29,059 --> 01:13:32,145
- Keep dreamin'.
- No, really...
